1
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:45,550
Wait.

2
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:46,593
What?

3
00:03:48,303 --> 00:03:49,429
This.

4
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:51,973
Later.

5
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,560
I wanna smoke.

6
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,190
I wanna smoke.

7
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:03,860
Fine. Smoke.

8
00:04:07,364 --> 00:04:09,282
Smoke all night.

9
00:05:14,723 --> 00:05:17,517
Be still.
Do not turn around.

10
00:05:17,601 --> 00:05:19,436
Do not turn around.

11
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,438
You will not be hurt.

12
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:45,595
- Bonjour, Nick.
- Bonjour, madame.

13
00:11:34,102 --> 00:11:35,187
Albert.

14
00:11:37,981 --> 00:11:40,275
Boss, hi.

15
00:11:40,358 --> 00:11:43,278
- Jean-Claude.
- So, the trip was good?

16
00:11:45,155 --> 00:11:46,907
- So, how are we doing?
- Great.

17
00:11:46,948 --> 00:11:49,409
We have many reservations
for tonight.

18
00:11:49,451 --> 00:11:51,495
Good. How many covers
did we have last night?

19
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:53,497
- Over 150.
- Good.

20
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,416
- Bar was steady.
- How was the music?

21
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:59,044
- Great band.
- Good. Good.

22
00:12:03,423 --> 00:12:05,467
Scotch on the rocks, please,
little water.

23
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,469
Yeah, sure.

24
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:26,113
Monsieur Max.

25
00:12:26,196 --> 00:12:28,865
Where-- Where Nicky?

26
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:33,870
Voila. Back from Bermuda.

27
00:12:33,954 --> 00:12:35,414
Did you have a good trip?

28
00:12:35,497 --> 00:12:38,291
Well, not as interesting
as yours, I'm sure.

29
00:12:39,876 --> 00:12:42,963
My God!
Let me get a look at you.

30
00:12:43,004 --> 00:12:45,549
You look like shit.
What's your secret?

31
00:12:46,675 --> 00:12:48,635
Jean-Claude,
set up number two for us.

32
00:12:48,677 --> 00:12:50,220
Yeah, sure.

33
00:12:57,227 --> 00:12:59,688
Just give us a little room.
Thank you.

34
00:13:03,275 --> 00:13:04,901
For sure.

35
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:06,903
There we are.

36
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,368
Bermuda.

37
00:13:17,205 --> 00:13:18,623
Oh, God.

38
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:22,085
Well.

39
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:25,881
- It was pretty tight out there.
- Good. It'll keep you sharp.

40
00:13:27,883 --> 00:13:31,053
I got a minor development.

41
00:13:31,136 --> 00:13:33,972
- We lost the buyer.
- What do you mean, "lost"?

42
00:13:34,056 --> 00:13:37,768
Well, she's in a brass casket
six feet underground...

43
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:40,020
never to be heard from again.

44
00:13:40,979 --> 00:13:43,023
Well, I fronted 20,000
in expenses.

45
00:13:43,065 --> 00:13:45,776
Now I'm due that,
plus 250 for my end.

46
00:13:45,859 --> 00:13:47,861
You don't think I'm not
gonna take care of you?

47
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,905
I'm not gonna cover
your expenses and all that?

48
00:13:49,988 --> 00:13:53,575
It's not about covering my expenses.
It's the money. Find another buyer.

49
00:13:53,658 --> 00:13:56,078
Of course. But Jesus Christ,
shit happens.

50
00:13:56,161 --> 00:13:58,288
This thing's gonna drag out.
You've got to be patient.

51
00:13:58,955 --> 00:14:02,334
Wait a minute.
How about this?

52
00:14:02,417 --> 00:14:05,462
Four big ones
in your hand.

53
00:14:05,545 --> 00:14:07,839
Four million dollars
in your mitt.

54
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:11,176
- Four million?
- More than you ever dreamed of.

55
00:14:11,259 --> 00:14:14,137
More than we ever,
ever did together.

56
00:14:14,221 --> 00:14:16,390
Four million.
What are you into?

57
00:14:16,431 --> 00:14:19,684
Well, I spotted this item
which was really exceptional.

58
00:14:19,768 --> 00:14:23,647
It was European antiquity,
elegant...

59
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,483
and it was in the hands
of this real dumb prick...

60
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:28,151
that didn't know what he had.

61
00:14:29,194 --> 00:14:31,238
And unfortunately...

62
00:14:31,321 --> 00:14:33,740
it's become detained
in transit a little.

63
00:14:37,285 --> 00:14:39,329
You don't wanna know where?

64
00:14:39,413 --> 00:14:41,123
It depends.

65
00:14:41,206 --> 00:14:42,708
Depends on what?

66
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:45,794
- On what you're gonna tell me.
- Okay.

67
00:14:45,877 --> 00:14:49,172
It's in the Montreal
Customshouse.

68
00:14:51,717 --> 00:14:55,429
- No way. I'm sorry.
- Oh, yeah. Wait a minute.

69
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:58,473
I got a guy--
I got a guy inside.

70
00:14:58,557 --> 00:15:02,978
He gives you the whole layout,
handles security, everything--

71
00:15:03,061 --> 00:15:08,024
You used to tell me, "Steal outside
the country, in the States, Europe.

72
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:09,609
But Montreal,
live in Montreal."

73
00:15:09,651 --> 00:15:12,320
I said a lot of dumb things
in my day, didn't I?

74
00:15:12,404 --> 00:15:13,697
- But that's--
- Right.

75
00:15:14,906 --> 00:15:19,536
Let's just find another buyer
for this. I gotta open the place.

76
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:22,414
Okay, but I'm not finished
talking about this.

77
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:28,211
- Come on.
- You're making a large error here.

78
00:15:34,593 --> 00:15:36,511
Not bad.

79
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,192
- Yeah?
- I just landed.

80
00:15:50,275 --> 00:15:52,194
I got the delivery.

81
00:16:14,216 --> 00:16:15,717
Got the bag?

82
00:16:15,801 --> 00:16:18,595
- Yeah. Right here.
- Where's Johnny?

83
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:22,015
He got it in Istanbul,
right through the neck.

84
00:16:22,057 --> 00:16:24,309
- Jesus. He was a good kid.
- Yeah.

85
00:16:24,393 --> 00:16:26,103
Good and dead.

86
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:28,146
So you wanna talk,
or you wanna see what I got?

87
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:30,690
How can I be sure
you're okay?

88
00:16:32,067 --> 00:16:33,652
I suppose I could fuck you.

89
00:16:34,528 --> 00:16:35,946
That would work.

90
00:16:57,217 --> 00:16:59,678
Hey. You okay?

91
00:17:00,804 --> 00:17:02,305
Yeah. Great.

92
00:17:07,352 --> 00:17:10,689
- How was your trip?
- I don't know.

93
00:17:11,565 --> 00:17:13,650
Cities.

94
00:17:13,734 --> 00:17:17,738
They're all starting to look
the same. They really are.

95
00:17:24,578 --> 00:17:28,040
And the pasta in Rome
is not as good as yours.

96
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,793
And the ass pinchers.

97
00:17:31,877 --> 00:17:34,421
They used to look
so charmingly European.

98
00:17:34,504 --> 00:17:36,423
Not as good as me?

99
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:42,888
Come on.

100
00:17:43,764 --> 00:17:46,058
It really must be
what it is about you I like...

101
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:48,602
because you most definitely
are not common.

102
00:17:55,067 --> 00:17:57,652
- What if I were?
- What if you were what?

103
00:17:57,736 --> 00:18:00,781
A little more common,
you know, and around more.

104
00:18:00,864 --> 00:18:02,783
How much more?

105
00:18:02,866 --> 00:18:04,951
Like, "all the time" more.

106
00:18:05,035 --> 00:18:07,412
And I was just a jazz club owner
and not that other thing.

107
00:18:07,454 --> 00:18:08,830
How would you feel
about that?

108
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:13,877
Hey, are you saying
what I think you're saying?

109
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,505
I think that's
what I'm saying.

110
00:18:20,884 --> 00:18:25,180
Hey, baby, you know I've never
asked you to change anything for me.

111
00:18:25,263 --> 00:18:28,350
I know that. I'm just asking you,
how would you feel about that?

112
00:18:35,899 --> 00:18:38,026
I don't know.

113
00:18:40,362 --> 00:18:43,365
I suppose I'd have to give it
some serious thought.

114
00:18:45,492 --> 00:18:48,286
Then you'd better start
giving it some serious thought.

115
00:18:57,963 --> 00:19:01,216
Thank you.
So I'll see you when I see you?

116
00:19:01,299 --> 00:19:03,218
See you when I see you.

117
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:45,594
Excuse me.
Can you help me, please?

118
00:19:46,762 --> 00:19:48,847
Can you help me?

119
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:51,058
- Place Norman?
- Yes, yes.

120
00:19:51,141 --> 00:19:53,643
You go to the corner,
make a right. Go two blocks--

121
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:56,897
- Two.
- Two blocks, then a left one block.

122
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:59,483
- Again, please.
- Two blocks this way...

123
00:19:59,524 --> 00:20:01,068
one block that way
to the left.

124
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:03,695
- And you're right there.
- Okay, thank you.

125
00:20:03,779 --> 00:20:05,322
Thank you, Nick.

126
00:20:07,657 --> 00:20:09,409
What did you say?

127
00:20:09,493 --> 00:20:11,995
I said, "Thank you, Nick."

128
00:20:14,373 --> 00:20:18,418
I'm Max's guy in the customshouse.
We should talk.

129
00:20:19,961 --> 00:20:21,963
Okay, bye-bye. Thank you.

130
00:20:22,047 --> 00:20:23,965
Thank you. Bye.

131
00:20:30,055 --> 00:20:32,808
- Where's Max?
- He's in the sunroom.

132
00:20:37,104 --> 00:20:39,523
Nicoli, Nicoli.

133
00:20:39,564 --> 00:20:41,775
Have you lost
your fucking mind?

134
00:20:41,858 --> 00:20:44,820
My mind? Years ago. Why?

135
00:20:44,903 --> 00:20:47,823
- What did you tell this kid?
- What did I tell who?

136
00:20:47,906 --> 00:20:49,866
Your inside guy
with the retard act.

137
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:52,035
He was in front of my house.
He knew who I was.

138
00:20:53,995 --> 00:20:57,958
Wait. He must've followed me to
the club and made you from there.

139
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:00,460
Tell him he pulls a stunt like that
again, he'll end up in the hospital.

140
00:21:00,544 --> 00:21:04,715
Wait. Do you think I'm gonna set
you up with a jerk-off heister?

141
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:08,093
You gotta admit that this kid did
a pretty good dog and pony show.

142
00:21:08,135 --> 00:21:11,972
I don't care who is he. Don't expose
me like that. You know better.

143
00:21:12,055 --> 00:21:13,515
He's got it all pre-wired.

144
00:21:13,598 --> 00:21:15,934
- You go in, turn the key--
- I told you, I'm not interested.

145
00:21:15,976 --> 00:21:19,354
You're never gonna get another
chance at a score like this.

146
00:21:19,438 --> 00:21:21,398
- Why are you pushing this?
- Four million balls.

147
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:23,275
How many times
do I have to tell you?

148
00:21:23,358 --> 00:21:25,068
He's pushing it
because we're running out of time.

149
00:21:26,111 --> 00:21:28,905
If I'm gonna work
with a partner on this...

150
00:21:28,947 --> 00:21:30,824
we gotta start putting
our heads together right away.

151
00:21:30,907 --> 00:21:32,367
- What are you doing in my house?
- Take it easy.

152
00:21:32,451 --> 00:21:35,162
- All I'm saying--
- Who the fuck is this kid?

153
00:21:35,245 --> 00:21:37,914
- What the fuck do you know?
- I've been on this for three weeks.

154
00:21:37,998 --> 00:21:40,959
I gotta know if you're the guy
that Max says you are.

155
00:21:41,043 --> 00:21:44,212
- I gotta go.
- Nick, wait. Wait.

156
00:21:45,547 --> 00:21:49,468
I didn't come 500 miles just to--
Jack Teller. Nice to meet you too.

157
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:50,469
What the fuck?

158
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:53,305
You're not smart enough
to know where your dick is.

159
00:21:53,388 --> 00:21:56,558
We decided that you were gonna
sit tight until I called you.

160
00:21:56,641 --> 00:21:57,976
- Is that correct?
- Okay.

161
00:21:58,018 --> 00:22:00,812
I thought I could help you sell him
on it. I thought he was already in.

162
00:22:00,896 --> 00:22:04,358
Don't be so fucking creative.
Just get the fuck out of my house.

163
00:22:04,441 --> 00:22:08,028
When you guys get your shit
together, give me a call, okay?

164
00:22:08,111 --> 00:22:09,363
Unbelievable.

165
00:22:13,784 --> 00:22:18,747
It's a lucky thing
you came my way

166
00:22:19,956 --> 00:22:22,125
Today

167
00:22:22,209 --> 00:22:26,254
I'm about to tell you
something you should know

168
00:22:29,174 --> 00:22:33,178
All you have to do
is let the plot unfold

169
00:22:36,056 --> 00:22:38,517
Desire is clear

170
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:40,227
When you are near

171
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:42,270
You're about to give in

172
00:22:45,357 --> 00:22:48,068
Don't tease me so

173
00:22:48,151 --> 00:22:49,611
I think you know

174
00:22:49,695 --> 00:22:51,863
You're about to give in

175
00:22:54,449 --> 00:22:58,203
And if you listen
we can both find peace

176
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,416
Release

177
00:23:02,499 --> 00:23:06,044
Inhibitions that you
thought could not be there

178
00:24:15,489 --> 00:24:16,990
Jesus!

179
00:24:18,033 --> 00:24:19,993
God! Jesus! Take it easy.

180
00:24:21,453 --> 00:24:25,290
Listen close. Leave town
tonight. Don't come back.

181
00:24:25,332 --> 00:24:28,502
I see you again,
I break your fucking knees.

182
00:24:28,585 --> 00:24:30,045
I see you around Nick,
I'll kill ya.

183
00:24:30,128 --> 00:24:33,173
It's a dangerous fucking game
you're playing here.

184
00:24:33,256 --> 00:24:34,925
Are we clear?

185
00:24:40,931 --> 00:24:42,849
Yeah, we're clear.

186
00:25:23,682 --> 00:25:25,726
How did it go?

187
00:25:25,809 --> 00:25:27,227
Not as planned.

188
00:25:28,103 --> 00:25:32,399
- What do you want?
- Some fucking respect for starters.

189
00:25:33,233 --> 00:25:37,237
I mean, what are you thinking?
Now, I'm on a job here.

190
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,240
Now, if you just don't wanna come
in on it, that's fine. Say "no."

191
00:25:40,323 --> 00:25:43,201
But don't send some third-rate
rent-a-thug to brush me off.

192
00:25:43,243 --> 00:25:44,911
You can do it
like a professional.

193
00:25:47,664 --> 00:25:48,874
Hello.

194
00:25:50,167 --> 00:25:53,128
Yeah. You okay?

195
00:25:53,211 --> 00:25:55,672
He's right here. Don't worry.
Just go home.

196
00:25:55,756 --> 00:25:58,967
I'll call you later, all right?
That's okay.

197
00:25:59,051 --> 00:26:00,469
Okay.

198
00:26:01,595 --> 00:26:03,764
I didn't come here
to cause any trouble.

199
00:26:03,847 --> 00:26:05,265
I didn't.

200
00:26:06,349 --> 00:26:10,187
Coming up to you on the street
like that, that was a stupid move.

201
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:12,522
Sorry. Why don't we
just call it even?

202
00:26:12,606 --> 00:26:15,150
I just wanna say one thing to you,
then I'll go away.

203
00:26:15,233 --> 00:26:17,736
We don't have to bother each other
anymore if you don't want.

204
00:26:20,864 --> 00:26:23,909
I have been casing this place
for a couple of weeks now.

205
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:27,662
It's a little bit complicated,
but this is a very doable job.

206
00:26:27,746 --> 00:26:30,999
I can handle the system in there
if someone can break into this box.

207
00:26:32,793 --> 00:26:34,753
Look, I don't know you,
you don't know me.

208
00:26:34,795 --> 00:26:37,297
I know that's not
the best way to do things, but...

209
00:26:37,339 --> 00:26:39,966
I am very good
at what I do, okay?

210
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:43,804
And I take it very, very seriously.
You can check it out with Max.

211
00:26:43,887 --> 00:26:47,099
Now, if you are the guy
that he says you are...

212
00:26:47,182 --> 00:26:49,976
then we should check this out.

213
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,978
Just--Just take a look at it.

214
00:26:52,062 --> 00:26:54,981
That's all I'm saying,
'cause this is a very big payoff...

215
00:26:55,065 --> 00:26:56,983
for very acceptable risks.

216
00:27:03,657 --> 00:27:06,201
Just take a look at it.
Go look for yourself.

217
00:27:09,996 --> 00:27:12,541
I like your place.

218
00:27:12,624 --> 00:27:14,543
You got good taste.

219
00:28:54,184 --> 00:28:56,895
Oh, Jesus.
It's nice and dark in here.

220
00:28:56,937 --> 00:28:58,980
Fucking everything.

221
00:29:01,942 --> 00:29:03,777
Jesus.

222
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:06,530
Why don't you jump
for some lights in this place?

223
00:29:06,613 --> 00:29:11,243
Every time I come in here,
it's like hide-and-go-seek.

224
00:29:11,284 --> 00:29:13,245
How are you?

225
00:29:24,923 --> 00:29:28,927
Now, you gotta tell me the--

226
00:29:28,969 --> 00:29:31,638
the magic word.

227
00:29:31,722 --> 00:29:33,557
All right, I'm gonna do it.

228
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,769
Good, good. Jesus, sweetheart.
You're a sweetheart.

229
00:29:37,853 --> 00:29:39,771
Bravo.
You're making sense.

230
00:29:40,897 --> 00:29:44,818
But because of the risk involved,
my end's gotta be six million.

231
00:29:47,696 --> 00:29:48,905
Operator?

232
00:29:48,989 --> 00:29:51,783
I got a nut down here
that just said six million.

233
00:29:53,118 --> 00:29:55,954
No, no. Send paramedics.
I think-- Are you all right?

234
00:29:56,038 --> 00:29:57,080
I'm fine.

235
00:29:57,164 --> 00:29:59,833
Six fucking million dollars?
What happened to four?

236
00:29:59,916 --> 00:30:03,545
I'm doing it in my backyard. I'm
not gonna go like that. I'm sorry.

237
00:30:03,628 --> 00:30:05,547
If you want me to do this,
you gotta pay me what's right.

238
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:08,675
- It's gotta be that way.
- I always pay you what's right.

239
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:12,012
You always think you do.
I always know what you pay me.

240
00:30:12,095 --> 00:30:14,848
It's not always right.
I need this for this.

241
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,893
I like your style.

242
00:30:17,976 --> 00:30:19,895
Yeah, well, okay.
I understand.

243
00:30:21,521 --> 00:30:24,733
That's what I have to do. I wanna
pay off the club, the mortgage.

244
00:30:24,816 --> 00:30:26,526
I wanna own this place
free and clear.

245
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:29,112
I want it to be mine.
I live the way I want.

246
00:30:29,196 --> 00:30:30,489
Because after this,
no more jobs.

247
00:30:30,572 --> 00:30:33,825
This is the last one I'm doing.
I'm quitting for good.

248
00:30:33,909 --> 00:30:36,620
How many times have you
told me that in 25 years?

249
00:30:36,661 --> 00:30:38,997
I'm gonna believe that
when the pigs eat my brother.

250
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:42,334
- Right?
- I'm done. I'm done. No more.

251
00:30:44,753 --> 00:30:48,173
Well, okay.
I hope she's worth it.

252
00:30:52,302 --> 00:30:54,221
Here's numb-nuts.

253
00:30:57,182 --> 00:31:00,018
Nice house, nice club.
You must be really good.

254
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:05,357
I don't wanna have to do this,
but raise your arms.

255
00:31:08,151 --> 00:31:11,071
- Be my guest.
- He's all right.

256
00:31:14,366 --> 00:31:15,826
Okay?

257
00:31:22,916 --> 00:31:25,877
Is this a social call?
What are we doing here?

258
00:31:27,921 --> 00:31:29,506
I will explore this with you...

259
00:31:29,548 --> 00:31:32,384
but I run this operation
down to the smallest detail.

260
00:31:32,426 --> 00:31:35,721
If you have a problem with that,
we can all go home right now.

261
00:31:36,555 --> 00:31:38,181
Is there a problem with that?

262
00:31:39,307 --> 00:31:41,059
That's fine.

263
00:31:41,101 --> 00:31:44,187
You will tell me everything you
know, then I will design the plan.

264
00:31:44,229 --> 00:31:48,108
If I smell something about the job
or you that I don't like, I walk.

265
00:31:48,191 --> 00:31:51,278
If I think for one second you're
not living up to your end of it...

266
00:31:51,361 --> 00:31:54,114
or if you hold out on me
in any way, I walk.

267
00:31:54,197 --> 00:31:56,700
- Understood?
- That's fine.

268
00:31:56,742 --> 00:31:58,326
Tell me what you wanna know.

269
00:31:59,578 --> 00:32:03,623
- First, what are we looking for?
- You know what a scepter is?

270
00:32:03,707 --> 00:32:05,667
It's something
that a king holds.

271
00:32:06,793 --> 00:32:08,462
Right there.

272
00:32:08,545 --> 00:32:12,841
It was made in 1661 in France
for a special coronation...

273
00:32:14,051 --> 00:32:15,719
for a girl queen.

274
00:32:16,803 --> 00:32:19,639
- It's priceless.
- Not to us, it's not.

275
00:32:19,723 --> 00:32:22,768
What can you give me
on its specific location?

276
00:32:22,851 --> 00:32:25,145
I can give you the whole
building, okay? I got floor plans.

277
00:32:25,228 --> 00:32:27,856
I've been clocking the security
patterns for over three weeks.

278
00:32:27,939 --> 00:32:30,067
All right.
Paint me a picture.

279
00:32:31,276 --> 00:32:33,945
Okay. He fixed me up
with the job.

280
00:32:34,029 --> 00:32:36,490
Not me but Brian,
the guy on the street.

281
00:32:36,573 --> 00:32:37,908
Yeah, I remember.

282
00:32:37,949 --> 00:32:40,786
Is he traceable? Phone number?
Address? That stuff?

283
00:32:40,869 --> 00:32:43,205
It's totally tight. The guy's
a charity case, a favor.

284
00:32:43,288 --> 00:32:45,290
The guy truly doesn't
even exist on paper.

285
00:32:45,374 --> 00:32:48,418
He just shows up.
He's the assistant janitor...

286
00:32:48,502 --> 00:32:50,253
midnight to 8 a.m.

287
00:32:55,634 --> 00:32:57,260
The security's pretty basic.

288
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:59,805
At night, they lock the place down.
They bar the ground floor windows.

289
00:32:59,846 --> 00:33:03,433
You can only enter in through
one place, out by the truck court.

290
00:33:06,978 --> 00:33:09,648
Thank you, Hubert.
Thank you.

291
00:33:09,731 --> 00:33:12,442
Manpower's very light. They got one
guy sitting in a booth outside...

292
00:33:12,526 --> 00:33:14,903
just keeping an eye
on things.

293
00:33:16,571 --> 00:33:20,492
On the inside, everyone comes in
through a standard metal detector.

294
00:33:20,534 --> 00:33:24,621
It's tricky bringing things through,
but I've got that figured out.

295
00:33:24,663 --> 00:33:27,457
All the guards know me now,
so no one really looks too close.

296
00:33:27,499 --> 00:33:29,835
- Okay, thank you.
- All right.

297
00:33:29,918 --> 00:33:32,254
Once I'm inside,
I can go anywhere I want.

298
00:33:32,337 --> 00:33:33,797
Hey, Laurent.

299
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:37,551
Everything gets run from this
one little central command console.

300
00:33:37,634 --> 00:33:41,471
They've got fixed video systems in
the elevators and in the hallways.

301
00:33:41,513 --> 00:33:44,599
They got a couple magnetic doors,
but it's all very basic.

302
00:33:44,683 --> 00:33:48,270
Lots of overtime.
Not so much now.

303
00:33:48,353 --> 00:33:50,647
Now, the head janitor's
this old guy, Danny.

304
00:33:50,689 --> 00:33:53,066
He loves Brian.
Loves him.

305
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:55,527
I've got this guy completely
wrapped around my finger.

306
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:58,030
He'd do anything for me.

307
00:33:58,071 --> 00:34:00,115
And most of the time,
he's got me working with him.

308
00:34:00,198 --> 00:34:01,992
Kind of low-level shit,
just helping out.

309
00:34:02,034 --> 00:34:05,412
But I can get away from him plenty.
I got all kinds of reasons.

310
00:34:05,495 --> 00:34:08,957
I've sketched half the place
already. I've copied a lot of keys.

311
00:34:09,041 --> 00:34:12,210
I can get you access to basically
any room in the place.

312
00:34:12,294 --> 00:34:13,837
Where's the scepter?

313
00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:16,798
Well, see, that's the kink.

314
00:34:16,882 --> 00:34:18,425
Now, get this.

315
00:34:18,508 --> 00:34:21,428
It was arranged to be
brought into the country...

316
00:34:21,511 --> 00:34:25,515
inside the leg
of an antique piano.

317
00:34:25,557 --> 00:34:29,353
And it was so simple.
Then they impounded it.

318
00:34:29,394 --> 00:34:31,396
I mean, can you guess why?

319
00:34:31,438 --> 00:34:34,274
Fucking bugs.

320
00:34:34,358 --> 00:34:37,861
I mean, the whole shipment
was contaminated with termites.

321
00:34:37,944 --> 00:34:39,905
Asian longhorn beetles.

322
00:34:40,989 --> 00:34:42,908
We got fucked by bugs.

323
00:34:45,369 --> 00:34:46,870
These things
burrow into the wood...

324
00:34:46,953 --> 00:34:48,830
so they were in the crates
of most of the shipment.

325
00:34:48,914 --> 00:34:51,375
So they took the goods out
and delivered most of them.

326
00:34:51,458 --> 00:34:54,252
But the piano is made of wood too,
so they impounded it.

327
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:56,505
They took the whole thing
and put it in quarantine.

328
00:34:56,588 --> 00:34:59,216
Medium security,
third-floor lockup.

329
00:34:59,257 --> 00:35:00,842
They're really scared
of these things...

330
00:35:00,926 --> 00:35:02,594
and they can't send
them back to France.

331
00:35:05,263 --> 00:35:07,432
So they decided
to burn everything.

332
00:35:16,483 --> 00:35:18,443
Now, I'll tell ya...

333
00:35:18,485 --> 00:35:20,821
I didn't know which one of the
fucking legs this thing is in...

334
00:35:20,904 --> 00:35:24,032
but half of me was tempted to grab
them all and make a break for it.

335
00:35:24,116 --> 00:35:27,953
I mean, I don't know if this
thing's gonna melt or what.

336
00:35:29,121 --> 00:35:31,289
I mean, I was dying.

337
00:35:34,835 --> 00:35:37,170
I had to improvise a little.

338
00:35:41,883 --> 00:35:44,177
- I-I saw something in the fire.
- We're just burning stuff.

339
00:35:44,261 --> 00:35:48,473
No. Look, look.
I saw something in the--

340
00:35:48,557 --> 00:35:51,893
Piano. In the piano,
I saw a-- Look.

341
00:35:51,977 --> 00:35:53,061
- I saw something.
- Jack!

342
00:35:54,438 --> 00:35:56,565
There! There!

343
00:35:58,734 --> 00:36:00,652
What is it?

344
00:36:10,287 --> 00:36:11,955
So everybody's freaking out.

345
00:36:11,997 --> 00:36:14,082
Nobody knows what this is
or what to do with it.

346
00:36:14,166 --> 00:36:16,084
They don't see this kind
of excitement down there.

347
00:36:16,168 --> 00:36:18,170
So they call some supervisor.
They get him out of bed.

348
00:36:18,253 --> 00:36:20,672
He comes down,
he takes one look at this thing.

349
00:36:20,756 --> 00:36:23,884
He doesn't know what the hell it is,
but he knows it's worth a lot.

350
00:36:23,967 --> 00:36:26,970
He tells them, until they can
sort it out, put it in the basement.

351
00:36:27,763 --> 00:36:29,890
- And that's what they do.
- Don't worry. Don't worry.

352
00:36:29,931 --> 00:36:32,434
- Don't worry about it.
- I want to see, Danny.

353
00:36:32,517 --> 00:36:35,228
- Can I see?
- No. Come on. Let's go now.

354
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:37,731
Okay. Bye-bye. Bye.

355
00:36:53,205 --> 00:36:54,831
The basement
in the customshouse...

356
00:36:54,915 --> 00:36:57,209
is the most secure lockup
in eastern Canada.

357
00:36:57,292 --> 00:36:59,711
It was built as a bomb shelter
during the Cold War.

358
00:36:59,795 --> 00:37:03,256
All their important stuff's there--
state's evidence, narcotics...

359
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,092
confiscated weapons.

360
00:37:05,133 --> 00:37:07,928
That scepter is in a safe
somewhere in this room.

361
00:37:07,969 --> 00:37:10,013
But the thing is,
there's no-- there's no cameras.

362
00:37:10,097 --> 00:37:12,766
If there was, I would've seen
an angle on the video monitors.

363
00:37:12,849 --> 00:37:16,520
So if we can put you inside that
room, you can work on it all night.

364
00:37:18,689 --> 00:37:22,234
We'll need pictures of the safe
or a model number from their files.

365
00:37:22,317 --> 00:37:25,654
Then we're gonna need plans--
infrastructure maps...

366
00:37:25,737 --> 00:37:28,907
blueprints, schematics,
anything we can get our hands on.

367
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:30,867
That's all I got for now,
but give me two days.

368
00:37:30,951 --> 00:37:33,412
We just gotta find a way
to get into that basement.

369
00:38:15,871 --> 00:38:17,998
You gonna let it go, or are we gonna
drive around pissed all night?

370
00:38:18,081 --> 00:38:19,750
Why don't you kiss my ass?

371
00:38:44,524 --> 00:38:48,070
- We're about set up. You ready?
- Hold on.

372
00:39:04,878 --> 00:39:07,672
- Wanna give me a mark?
- Not yet. Not yet.

373
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,270
How you doing?

374
00:39:22,354 --> 00:39:24,815
Stay off the air
until I call.

375
00:39:48,797 --> 00:39:51,174
Three-three, two-six...

376
00:39:51,258 --> 00:39:53,635
two-nine, three-two.

377
00:39:53,677 --> 00:39:59,349
I repeat: 33, 26, 29, 32.

378
00:39:59,433 --> 00:40:03,520
Copy that. Three-three, two-six,
two-nine, three-two.

379
00:40:07,566 --> 00:40:11,319
Make a right.
Proceed east about 20 yards.

380
00:40:11,403 --> 00:40:13,321
You should see
the next opening.

381
00:40:21,955 --> 00:40:24,332
I'm at a wall here,
a cinder block wall...

382
00:40:24,416 --> 00:40:26,209
where you told me
I have to go.

383
00:40:26,293 --> 00:40:28,545
Are you sure about that?
It shows a straight shot on here.

384
00:40:28,628 --> 00:40:31,256
It's not my imagination.
I'm right here in front of it.

385
00:40:31,339 --> 00:40:33,717
You wanna come down here
and see for yourself?

386
00:40:35,177 --> 00:40:38,013
Right. Okay, okay. Hold on.

387
00:40:40,348 --> 00:40:42,267
All right,
just give me a second.

388
00:40:45,103 --> 00:40:48,023
- Can you read me?
- Make a left. Go about 20 feet.

389
00:40:48,065 --> 00:40:49,649
You should run
into a parallel tunnel.

390
00:40:49,733 --> 00:40:52,194
Make a right. You'll be
right back on course.

391
00:40:55,906 --> 00:40:58,700
Take the tunnel
about 150yards due west.

392
00:40:58,742 --> 00:41:01,036
You'll reach a "T" junction.
Tell me when you're there.

393
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:02,537
About 300yards.

394
00:41:02,621 --> 00:41:05,499
- Came to the end. Made a right.
- Head Northwest.

395
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,334
Northeast.
Check that. Northeast.

396
00:41:07,376 --> 00:41:08,877
One second. Hold on.

397
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,006
- Are you with me?
- Going west. Going west.

398
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:17,886
- I'm going west. I'm in a circle.
- Make a right. Go 40yards east.

399
00:41:17,928 --> 00:41:21,890
Then make a left turn.
Go about--

400
00:41:21,973 --> 00:41:24,017
Make a right. Head back.

401
00:41:24,059 --> 00:41:26,520
You got maybe 500 yards to go.

402
00:41:33,777 --> 00:41:37,114
Straight ahead 20 feet, and you
should be dead under the room.

403
00:41:37,197 --> 00:41:38,782
The tunnel will keep on going.

404
00:41:38,865 --> 00:41:41,284
But look up.
You should see the access ladder.

405
00:41:47,874 --> 00:41:49,876
I'm at a shaft.
I'm gonna climb up.

406
00:42:02,097 --> 00:42:04,015
What are you doing?

407
00:42:04,766 --> 00:42:06,143
Still climbing.

408
00:42:27,122 --> 00:42:28,040
This looks like it.

409
00:44:02,092 --> 00:44:04,010
I'm done.

410
00:44:15,981 --> 00:44:17,899
What the hell is this?

411
00:44:23,697 --> 00:44:25,866
Hey, you got a utility crew
all over the entrance.

412
00:44:25,949 --> 00:44:27,868
You're gonna have to find
another way out.

413
00:45:02,152 --> 00:45:04,279
Where are you?

414
00:45:11,244 --> 00:45:13,622
I'm at De La Montagne
and Ottawa.

415
00:45:13,705 --> 00:45:15,707
Repeat:
De La Montagne and Ottawa.

416
00:45:15,749 --> 00:45:17,709
Got it. We're on our way.

417
00:45:24,549 --> 00:45:26,468
This should be it,
right here.

418
00:45:27,719 --> 00:45:30,597
We're here.
I'm just trying to find you.

419
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:33,100
There. He's right over there.

420
00:45:55,455 --> 00:45:57,249
Okay, you're all clear.

421
00:45:57,290 --> 00:45:59,251
I'm coming out.

422
00:46:43,628 --> 00:46:45,047
Hello.

423
00:46:46,673 --> 00:46:48,633
Anybody home?

424
00:47:07,694 --> 00:47:09,946
- Champagne.
- Yeah.

425
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:12,199
- Nice touch.
- Nice dress.

426
00:47:12,282 --> 00:47:14,117
You like? Thank you.

427
00:47:16,453 --> 00:47:21,124
So, you asked me a question
a couple of days ago.

428
00:47:21,208 --> 00:47:23,668
And you gave it
some serious thought?

429
00:47:24,628 --> 00:47:26,546
Actually,
I forgot the question.

430
00:47:29,007 --> 00:47:31,510
Here's my answer.

431
00:47:31,593 --> 00:47:33,095
You're not holding up
your glass.

432
00:47:33,178 --> 00:47:34,513
I'm sorry.

433
00:47:36,807 --> 00:47:39,518
My father was a lawyer--
very smart man--

434
00:47:39,601 --> 00:47:42,938
and he would always say
that a deal is only good...

435
00:47:43,021 --> 00:47:46,858
if it leaves both parties feeling
as if they gave up something.

436
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:50,112
Is an answer coming soon?
'Cause the glass is getting heavy.

437
00:47:52,197 --> 00:47:53,615
Okay.

438
00:47:54,783 --> 00:47:56,910
I will change my life...

439
00:47:56,993 --> 00:47:58,912
I will move here...

440
00:48:00,747 --> 00:48:02,082
I will love you...

441
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:07,879
and believe that this is
the best decision that I've made.

442
00:48:09,631 --> 00:48:12,676
But I will not move here
if it means that one day...

443
00:48:12,759 --> 00:48:14,469
I might have to talk
to you through glass.

444
00:48:14,553 --> 00:48:16,972
I won't move here if it means
spending my nights worrying.

445
00:48:17,055 --> 00:48:22,602
So if you can promise me, as of
right now, that you're through...

446
00:48:23,854 --> 00:48:26,898
then we can drink
to making changes.

447
00:48:35,282 --> 00:48:38,243
I-- I said you could drink now.

448
00:48:38,285 --> 00:48:39,369
I know.

449
00:48:39,453 --> 00:48:41,997
I wanna do all that.

450
00:48:43,623 --> 00:48:47,919
I just have to tell you
that I'm gonna do one more thing...

451
00:48:47,961 --> 00:48:50,088
- and that's it.
- Oh, fuck.

452
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:52,632
Everything you said is great.
It's perfect.

453
00:48:52,674 --> 00:48:55,969
I just have one more thing
I have to do.

454
00:48:56,053 --> 00:48:58,722
You put that out there when you
knew you couldn't follow through.

455
00:48:58,805 --> 00:49:01,641
I put it out there because--
I am following through.

456
00:49:01,683 --> 00:49:03,643
- This is my last one. I promise.
- Sure it is.

457
00:49:03,727 --> 00:49:05,771
I promise you
it is my last one.

458
00:49:05,812 --> 00:49:08,482
Then quit. Quit now.

459
00:49:08,565 --> 00:49:11,651
- What does "one last one" mean?
- It means we don't need anything.

460
00:49:11,735 --> 00:49:15,614
I didn't need anything before,
and I don't need anything now...

461
00:49:15,655 --> 00:49:17,908
but what I wanted
was to be with you.

462
00:49:17,991 --> 00:49:21,536
And what I didn't need was exactly
this kind of painful bullshit.

463
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:26,166
My life wasn't perfect before,
but at least we were clear.

464
00:49:28,919 --> 00:49:29,920
Give me some--

465
00:49:32,214 --> 00:49:34,174
I'll see you when I see you.

466
00:50:45,245 --> 00:50:47,539
Hey, what are you doing?

467
00:50:47,622 --> 00:50:50,375
Somebody put fingerprints
on my window, Danny.

468
00:50:50,459 --> 00:50:53,712
- You don't need to do it.
- I like a clean window, Danny.

469
00:50:53,795 --> 00:50:55,005
It's all right.

470
00:50:55,088 --> 00:50:58,258
We missed you last night.
You feeling better?

471
00:50:58,341 --> 00:50:59,801
- Yes, thank you.
- Sure?

472
00:50:59,885 --> 00:51:01,094
Yes, I'm okay.
Thank you, Danny.

473
00:51:01,178 --> 00:51:04,806
- Take your time. Okay, bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

474
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:05,974
Bye.

475
00:51:23,033 --> 00:51:24,951
That's your safe.

476
00:51:30,165 --> 00:51:33,251
Traeger standing jeweler's safe,
this year's model.

477
00:51:33,335 --> 00:51:36,588
If it's new, it's gonna be tough
to get the schematics.

478
00:51:36,671 --> 00:51:38,673
I've got all
this year's books.

479
00:51:38,715 --> 00:51:41,134
- Really?
- Yeah. What else?

480
00:51:41,218 --> 00:51:44,471
Okay, the system's
Ironclad Security.

481
00:51:44,554 --> 00:51:46,181
They're a big commercial
industrial outfit.

482
00:51:46,223 --> 00:51:48,558
They handle a lot
of the government buildings here.

483
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:51,728
Now, this building's pretty old.
The lines are all over the place.

484
00:51:51,812 --> 00:51:54,815
They're easy to find. I can cut in
three or four different places...

485
00:51:54,898 --> 00:51:58,610
and let you in from there, but I
need the engineering pass codes.

486
00:51:58,694 --> 00:52:00,237
I've been looking.
They don't keep them in here.

487
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:03,657
They'll be at Ironclad.
I don't know what to do.

488
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:05,033
Okay.

489
00:52:06,702 --> 00:52:08,620
What, are you
calling someone now?

490
00:52:12,874 --> 00:52:15,669
- What? Who is this?
- It's me. Turn down the music.

491
00:52:18,422 --> 00:52:20,674
Hey, Nick, I am fucked up.

492
00:52:20,757 --> 00:52:23,093
My mother's totally
out of control.

493
00:52:23,176 --> 00:52:24,803
Listen. Listen carefully.

494
00:52:24,886 --> 00:52:26,555
Ironclad Security.

495
00:52:26,638 --> 00:52:28,682
- Big outfit.
- Yeah.

496
00:52:28,765 --> 00:52:31,268
I need engineering pass codes
for the customshouse.

497
00:52:31,351 --> 00:52:33,395
I don't know, man.
my concentration's shot.

498
00:52:33,437 --> 00:52:36,732
I haven't slept in, like, a month.
Wait. What customshouse?

499
00:52:37,441 --> 00:52:38,567
Montreal.

500
00:52:40,777 --> 00:52:42,487
You're not pissing
in our own pool, man.

501
00:52:42,571 --> 00:52:45,157
You have always said you were never
gonna do a job here in Montreal.

502
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,909
- I know. I know. Can you do it?
- Steven!

503
00:52:47,951 --> 00:52:49,786
Who are you talking to
at this hour?

504
00:52:49,828 --> 00:52:53,999
I am having a fucking conversation
with a friend of mine, Mother!

505
00:52:54,791 --> 00:52:58,295
- Are you-- Are you okay?
- She is a ghoul.

506
00:52:58,378 --> 00:53:00,797
Now, tell me
exactly what you want.

507
00:53:00,881 --> 00:53:04,843
Just one second. Here's someone
who can tell you what we need.

508
00:53:04,926 --> 00:53:07,304
Just tell him what you need.

509
00:53:07,387 --> 00:53:10,640
I need separate disarm and reset
master codes for the whole system...

510
00:53:10,682 --> 00:53:13,060
and I need the individual
sector bypass codes...

511
00:53:13,143 --> 00:53:16,730
so I can shut down one zone without
lighting off the whole board.

512
00:53:16,813 --> 00:53:18,857
- Okay?
- Yes.

513
00:53:20,650 --> 00:53:22,110
- You got that?
- Got it.

514
00:53:22,194 --> 00:53:24,780
Now, listen, I'm gonna
need this within 48 hours.

515
00:53:24,821 --> 00:53:26,656
If you do that,
I'll double your last price.

516
00:53:27,616 --> 00:53:30,327
Dude, give me a Kaypro 64
and a live dial tone...

517
00:53:30,410 --> 00:53:32,662
and I can do anything.

518
00:53:34,623 --> 00:53:37,542
Oh, now you are going to die.

519
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,463
This is someone
you work with?

520
00:53:41,505 --> 00:53:43,757
And you're giving me
a hard time.

521
00:54:14,705 --> 00:54:18,166
Thursday, 8:07a.m.

522
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:21,211
Hi. I got your message.
One of the stewardesses is sick...

523
00:54:21,294 --> 00:54:24,423
so I have to cover for her
on a New York run.

524
00:54:24,506 --> 00:54:27,342
We have to talk when I come
through in a couple of days.

525
00:54:27,384 --> 00:54:29,344
Okay?Bye.

526
00:54:30,554 --> 00:54:32,472
End of messages.

527
00:54:42,482 --> 00:54:45,152
Just lock it.

528
00:54:45,235 --> 00:54:48,655
- You work here?
- No. Here.

529
00:54:56,663 --> 00:54:58,707
Come on.

530
00:54:58,790 --> 00:55:00,751
Come on.
Come on in.

531
00:55:16,516 --> 00:55:18,435
Want some coffee?

532
00:55:23,982 --> 00:55:27,652
Jeez. Is this
what we're dealing with?

533
00:55:32,032 --> 00:55:33,909
Page 720.

534
00:55:38,372 --> 00:55:43,418
- Where can I get one of these?
- You gotta know the right people.

535
00:55:43,502 --> 00:55:46,380
Traeger floor safe.
Here it is.

536
00:55:47,172 --> 00:55:50,092
Solid steel body.

537
00:55:50,175 --> 00:55:52,552
Filled door
with aluminum and cobalt.

538
00:55:53,470 --> 00:55:56,515
Half-inch hard plate.
Double dial.

539
00:55:58,350 --> 00:56:00,519
You're gonna need two,
three hours to drill through that.

540
00:56:00,602 --> 00:56:03,397
- You can't drill this.
- Why not?

541
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:06,775
'Cause this is a newer model
and it's got these glass packs.

542
00:56:06,858 --> 00:56:10,153
See the glass pack here? See?

543
00:56:10,237 --> 00:56:13,407
Drill through that, the glass breaks
and those bolts spring into place.

544
00:56:13,490 --> 00:56:15,242
You're fucked. They're locked.
Forget it.

545
00:56:15,283 --> 00:56:17,577
You can't break it
with a bulldozer.

546
00:56:17,619 --> 00:56:20,247
I've never seen anything like that.
What do you have in mind?

547
00:56:20,330 --> 00:56:23,375
I don't know, but if somebody
built it, somebody can unbuild it.

548
00:56:34,428 --> 00:56:37,431
Yeah, see, when I shut this down,
you'll see this light go off...

549
00:56:37,472 --> 00:56:40,017
but up in the booth,
nothing will register.

550
00:56:43,353 --> 00:56:45,981
- Is that your box?
- That's it.

551
00:56:46,064 --> 00:56:48,066
That's a fucking monster.
That's three times the size of this.

552
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:49,735
Even bigger than that.

553
00:56:49,776 --> 00:56:53,071
See that over there?

554
00:56:53,113 --> 00:56:56,116
You can see it better over here.

555
00:56:56,199 --> 00:56:59,244
That's an active infrared post.

556
00:56:59,286 --> 00:57:01,371
I don't know.
That wasn't on the system specs.

557
00:57:01,455 --> 00:57:04,875
That's gotta be some independent
loop they set up just in the cage.

558
00:57:05,834 --> 00:57:07,794
I'll take care of it.

559
00:57:13,842 --> 00:57:18,889
All right, just calm down, okay?
I'll be over in a few minutes.

560
00:57:19,890 --> 00:57:22,309
I gotta take care of something.
I'll drop you off.

561
00:57:47,459 --> 00:57:49,669
My mom's only out
for about a half an hour.

562
00:57:54,925 --> 00:57:58,387
I was cruising around Ironclad's
server at the root COBOL level...

563
00:57:58,470 --> 00:58:03,392
when someone counter-cracked me,
hacked into my machines, my data.

564
00:58:03,475 --> 00:58:05,310
For three minutes,
I was fully exposed.

565
00:58:05,394 --> 00:58:09,731
Now I have to fire wall my whole
operations all from scratch.

566
00:58:09,815 --> 00:58:13,360
- Can you tell me that in English?
- Sorry.

567
00:58:13,443 --> 00:58:16,321
I was a few keystrokes away from
pulling those engineering codes...

568
00:58:16,405 --> 00:58:18,532
when I bump into a guy
on the other end.

569
00:58:18,615 --> 00:58:21,451
- And what's on the other end?
- Ironclad's computers.

570
00:58:21,493 --> 00:58:23,662
My guess is he's some
low-level systems administrator.

571
00:58:23,745 --> 00:58:28,875
So, we switch to a private
chat room, and he sends me this.

572
00:58:30,794 --> 00:58:31,712
Can you believe that?

573
00:58:31,795 --> 00:58:34,965
The guy comes into my world
and calls me an asshole.

574
00:58:35,006 --> 00:58:38,093
- Can you get me the bypass codes?
- I type, " How much?" He types...

575
00:58:38,176 --> 00:58:39,970
" Engineering codes for
the customshouse basement?"

576
00:58:40,053 --> 00:58:42,139
I say, "You guessed it,
Blue's Clues."

577
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:44,266
And he says, " Fuck you."
And I say, " No, fuck you."

578
00:58:44,349 --> 00:58:47,019
And he says, " No, fuck you."
I'm like, " No, fuck you."

579
00:58:47,102 --> 00:58:49,021
Then he's like, " No, fuck--"

580
00:58:49,062 --> 00:58:51,606
Can you get me the bypass codes?

581
00:58:52,858 --> 00:58:56,653
The guy wants 50 thou
in exchange for the codes.

582
00:58:56,737 --> 00:58:59,656
- Fifty thousand.
- Yes.

583
00:59:02,325 --> 00:59:03,744
Get the account number.

584
00:59:03,827 --> 00:59:05,912
I'll wire the money, and he'll
deliver the codes through you.

585
00:59:05,996 --> 00:59:07,497
Negative.
The guy won't go for a transfer.

586
00:59:07,581 --> 00:59:10,000
He wants cash
and he wants to do it in person.

587
00:59:11,334 --> 00:59:13,045
- Anything else?
- No.

588
00:59:13,128 --> 00:59:16,089
You set it up.
I'll let myself out.

589
00:59:16,173 --> 00:59:19,217
When this score's done, I'm gonna
brute this creep with everything.

590
00:59:19,301 --> 00:59:22,929
By the time I'm done with this fuck,
he won't be able to hide in Bolivia!

591
00:59:51,583 --> 00:59:54,711
Jesus.
Look at all these people.

592
00:59:54,753 --> 00:59:57,672
Who sets up a meeting
in a public park?

593
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:04,554
- You see him?
- Still looking.

594
01:00:19,569 --> 01:00:22,989
Got him.
He brought backup.

595
01:00:24,616 --> 01:00:26,618
Okay, I got him.

596
01:00:39,464 --> 01:00:42,259
Hey, how ya doing?
Good to see ya.

597
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:45,387
Shake my hand. That's right.
You my guy?

598
01:00:45,470 --> 01:00:46,680
Yeah.

599
01:00:46,763 --> 01:00:49,891
- Who's this?
- Cousin.

600
01:00:49,975 --> 01:00:53,603
Cousin? Okay. See the guy
over my left shoulder...

601
01:00:53,645 --> 01:00:58,859
back there on the bench,
reading the paper, the big one?

602
01:00:58,942 --> 01:01:02,487
That's my cousin, okay?

603
01:01:02,571 --> 01:01:06,616
So we've all got family here,
which is nice, I think. Yeah? Okay.

604
01:01:06,658 --> 01:01:11,163
Let me give you that. Look inside
and make sure you're happy.

605
01:01:15,834 --> 01:01:17,127
No, don't take that out.

606
01:01:17,210 --> 01:01:20,297
Hey, man, don't give me orders.
I get orders all day, okay?

607
01:01:20,338 --> 01:01:22,466
Can't count the money
in a public place.

608
01:01:22,507 --> 01:01:24,801
That's why you don't
set a meeting in a park.

609
01:01:24,885 --> 01:01:26,720
Just for future reference.

610
01:01:27,846 --> 01:01:29,973
Just flip through it in the bag.

611
01:01:31,516 --> 01:01:33,769
We're about set to go here.
You ready?

612
01:01:33,852 --> 01:01:35,020
What the fuck is that?

613
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:37,981
He's gonna give me the numbers, and
I'm gonna read 'em into this mike...

614
01:01:38,023 --> 01:01:40,025
to a friend of mine
who's gonna check 'em out.

615
01:01:43,528 --> 01:01:45,822
Did you think I was gonna
write it down on a cocktail napkin?

616
01:01:46,615 --> 01:01:49,659
- Okay, ready.
- Okay, you're on.

617
01:01:51,495 --> 01:01:55,165
First set: 3-1-7.

618
01:01:55,248 --> 01:01:58,335
- 3-1-7.
- Got it. 3-1-7.

619
01:01:58,377 --> 01:02:02,672
Steven, 3-1-7.

620
01:02:02,756 --> 01:02:05,300
Confirm 3-1-7.

621
01:02:10,389 --> 01:02:15,143
Just be a second.
Are you guys maternal cousins?

622
01:02:29,157 --> 01:02:31,952
- First numbers are clean.
- They're clean. They're clean.

623
01:02:32,035 --> 01:02:34,287
You tell the hack
at the other end of that wire...

624
01:02:34,371 --> 01:02:37,165
he tries to get in my system again,
I will fry him, okay?

625
01:02:37,249 --> 01:02:39,084
Why don't we worry about
next time next time, okay?

626
01:02:39,167 --> 01:02:41,211
Let's get this done before
people start looking at us.

627
01:02:41,253 --> 01:02:44,381
- Give me the second set.
- 9-4-6.

628
01:02:44,464 --> 01:02:47,384
- 9-4-6.
- 9-4-6.

629
01:02:47,426 --> 01:02:51,513
Repeat: 9-4-6. 9-4-6.

630
01:02:58,270 --> 01:03:01,231
- Take it easy. Relax. Have a smoke.
- I don't smoke.

631
01:03:01,273 --> 01:03:05,360
Me either, so good for us.
You guys local? You live here?

632
01:03:05,444 --> 01:03:08,155
Why are you asking
so many fucking questions?

633
01:03:13,493 --> 01:03:16,747
- They're good.
- Second set is good.

634
01:03:16,830 --> 01:03:18,331
What's the third one?

635
01:03:20,667 --> 01:03:22,627
5-8-3-9.

636
01:03:22,669 --> 01:03:24,880
5-8-3-9.

637
01:03:24,963 --> 01:03:27,424
5-8-3-9. Got it.

638
01:03:27,507 --> 01:03:31,011
5-8-3-9.

639
01:03:40,479 --> 01:03:42,773
This is taking too long.
I'm gonna fucking lose it.

640
01:03:42,814 --> 01:03:44,649
Shut up, Eric.

641
01:03:44,733 --> 01:03:47,903
They have to verify the numbers
off the server. It takes some time.

642
01:03:47,986 --> 01:03:49,488
Just relax, Eric.

643
01:03:53,033 --> 01:03:54,951
Can you help me out? It's turning
into amateur hour out here.

644
01:03:54,993 --> 01:03:57,704
- Fuck you, asshole.
- What are you doing?

645
01:03:57,788 --> 01:03:59,289
One of them has a gun.

646
01:03:59,373 --> 01:04:01,458
Burt, big guy's got a gun.

647
01:04:01,541 --> 01:04:03,293
Steven, how's it going?
We're losing these guys.

648
01:04:03,377 --> 01:04:06,296
- I'm working it, man.
- Steven, want some lunch?

649
01:04:06,338 --> 01:04:08,715
I'm on the phone, bitch!

650
01:04:08,799 --> 01:04:09,966
- You all right?
- We're fine.

651
01:04:10,050 --> 01:04:14,888
Don't anybody move.
Eric, look at my hand right now.

652
01:04:16,723 --> 01:04:20,560
If you take that out, I'm gonna take
this out, be a big fucking mess.

653
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,146
Put it away, Eric.

654
01:04:23,188 --> 01:04:25,315
There's kids all around.
What are you thinking?

655
01:04:25,399 --> 01:04:30,278
Put it away. Take a deep breath
and just put it in your back pocket.

656
01:04:30,362 --> 01:04:32,572
Put it away.

657
01:04:36,243 --> 01:04:38,745
- They're all good.
- Last set of numbers confirmed.

658
01:04:38,829 --> 01:04:40,831
Last set of numbers confirmed.
Let's get out of here.

659
01:04:51,425 --> 01:04:52,884
Next time, don't bring a gun.

660
01:04:52,926 --> 01:04:56,638
Listen, I thought
I might need one, and I did.

661
01:04:56,722 --> 01:04:58,849
- Now we've got the codes.
- Don't bring a gun.

662
01:05:07,941 --> 01:05:11,153
I called. They said you hadn't
checked in yet. No.

663
01:05:16,283 --> 01:05:18,618
So what time you getting in?

664
01:05:20,996 --> 01:05:23,290
Come on, honey.
Don't stay at a hotel.

665
01:05:23,373 --> 01:05:25,917
Just come over to my place.
I'll cook some--

666
01:05:37,846 --> 01:05:39,431
Yeah. Yeah.

667
01:05:39,514 --> 01:05:41,933
I was just saying come to my place.
I'll cook something.

668
01:05:41,975 --> 01:05:44,019
You know, we'll talk, okay?

669
01:05:48,106 --> 01:05:50,901
I'm thinking 'bout a place

670
01:05:50,984 --> 01:05:53,653
I'm waiting for the day

671
01:05:53,737 --> 01:05:58,158
When I will make my getaway

672
01:05:59,284 --> 01:06:02,412
Because as any fool can see

673
01:06:02,496 --> 01:06:04,956
There's nothing here for me

674
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:08,752
But hurry up, boy
bring that water

675
01:06:08,835 --> 01:06:11,254
Don't do things
you shouldn't oughta

676
01:06:11,338 --> 01:06:13,215
He's good.

677
01:06:15,008 --> 01:06:17,844
When you gotta be there?

678
01:06:17,928 --> 01:06:21,973
I'll go in in a couple hours.
I'm okay. I'm doing fine.

679
01:06:23,350 --> 01:06:26,186
Listen, tell me something.
Tell me something.

680
01:06:26,228 --> 01:06:28,480
All the years
you've been doing this...

681
01:06:28,522 --> 01:06:30,899
what's the biggest gamble
you ever took?

682
01:06:30,982 --> 01:06:34,653
On the job.
You know, biggest long shot.

683
01:06:34,736 --> 01:06:36,947
I don't take long shots.

684
01:06:37,030 --> 01:06:39,533
I know you're careful.
You know, I'm careful too.

685
01:06:39,616 --> 01:06:42,202
That's not what I mean.
I mean--

686
01:06:42,285 --> 01:06:44,830
When you were starting out,
when you were just getting going...

687
01:06:44,871 --> 01:06:47,749
you must have taken
some fliers here and there.

688
01:06:47,833 --> 01:06:49,918
Done something that was
a little wild. I'm just curious.

689
01:06:50,001 --> 01:06:51,837
Never took long shots.

690
01:06:55,674 --> 01:06:57,259
I'm gonna say something to you.

691
01:06:57,342 --> 01:06:59,428
You're smart, you're talented
and you know a few things...

692
01:06:59,511 --> 01:07:02,681
but talent means nothing
if you don't make the right choices.

693
01:07:02,764 --> 01:07:06,184
There's talented people out there
who never see daylight anymore.

694
01:07:06,226 --> 01:07:08,478
Last thing, it takes discipline...

695
01:07:08,562 --> 01:07:10,522
because this whole game
is one big long shot...

696
01:07:10,605 --> 01:07:12,858
and if you don't have the discipline
to stay away from the fliers...

697
01:07:12,899 --> 01:07:15,902
or from the gambles or whatever else
you wanna call a stupid move...

698
01:07:15,986 --> 01:07:19,239
then, my friend, I'm afraid to say,
one day you will go down.

699
01:07:19,322 --> 01:07:20,824
It's inevitable.

700
01:07:21,616 --> 01:07:23,910
You want my advice?

701
01:07:24,327 --> 01:07:26,204
Make a list of everything
you want now...

702
01:07:26,288 --> 01:07:29,499
and plan on spending the next
25 years of your life getting it.

703
01:07:29,583 --> 01:07:32,461
Slowly, piece by piece.

704
01:07:39,885 --> 01:07:41,386
I see what you're saying.

705
01:07:42,888 --> 01:07:47,351
But still, I'm looking at you,
and you got all this already...

706
01:07:47,392 --> 01:07:50,020
and you're sitting here with me,
working with a partner...

707
01:07:50,103 --> 01:07:53,148
in the city where you live, on a job
that's gotten more complicated...

708
01:07:53,231 --> 01:07:55,692
than you thought it was gonna be.

709
01:07:55,734 --> 01:07:58,236
So I know you're still
taking a shot at something.

710
01:08:04,159 --> 01:08:06,328
I gotta go.

711
01:08:08,163 --> 01:08:10,374
See ya tomorrow.

712
01:08:17,589 --> 01:08:19,591
The maintenance crews
come in the tunnels by 6a.m.

713
01:08:19,633 --> 01:08:21,593
I gotta be back in the hole by 5:30.

714
01:08:21,677 --> 01:08:24,054
As soon as the guards leave,
you gotta tell me right away.

715
01:08:24,096 --> 01:08:26,223
- You can't be late.
- I'm not worried about my end.

716
01:08:26,431 --> 01:08:31,353
I'm wondering how you're gonna
break that safe in half an hour.

717
01:08:31,353 --> 01:08:33,188
You know, I mean--

718
01:08:52,124 --> 01:08:55,377
- Is that even possible?
- Just physics.

719
01:08:59,965 --> 01:09:02,968
- How long is that gonna take?
- Twelve, fifteen minutes, tops.

720
01:09:03,010 --> 01:09:05,137
Fifteen minutes, tops?

721
01:09:06,847 --> 01:09:09,975
Okay. Okay.

722
01:09:09,975 --> 01:09:14,146
Then if you're on the box by 5:00,
the prize goes in the bag by 5: 1 5.

723
01:09:14,187 --> 01:09:17,607
- You got no problem at all.
- 5: 1 5, 5:30, I'm back in the hole.

724
01:09:17,649 --> 01:09:20,944
- You reset the system.
- That's perfect.

725
01:09:21,028 --> 01:09:23,113
I'll pack up my shit.
I can meet you here.

726
01:09:23,196 --> 01:09:26,450
- We can go to Max, or I can--
- We're not gonna meet back here.

727
01:09:26,533 --> 01:09:29,119
- I'll meet you at Max's, then.
- No.

728
01:09:29,202 --> 01:09:32,247
You'll finish out your shift.
I go to Max. He does his thing.

729
01:09:32,330 --> 01:09:33,999
He pays us off.
We never see each other again.

730
01:09:34,207 --> 01:09:37,085
Forget it. Just forget it.
I'm gonna come with you to Max's.

731
01:09:37,294 --> 01:09:39,880
- We'll deliver it together.
- No, you're not.

732
01:09:40,005 --> 01:09:42,966
Listen. I've done this
down to the last detail.

733
01:09:43,008 --> 01:09:45,427
Don't put me on the sideline
when it's time to collect.

734
01:09:45,469 --> 01:09:47,929
- Don't do it.
- Listen to me.

735
01:09:48,013 --> 01:09:50,307
You do anything out of the ordinary,
you're gonna get made.

736
01:09:50,432 --> 01:09:54,436
Do you understand that?
Be smart. Finish out your shift.

737
01:09:59,191 --> 01:10:01,318
- You're the boss.
- Okay.

738
01:10:16,375 --> 01:10:19,044
Steven got these from a supplier.
They're throwaways.

739
01:10:19,127 --> 01:10:20,837
Totally untraceable.

740
01:10:25,050 --> 01:10:28,595
People are talking. They say Max
is in trouble with Teddy Salida...

741
01:10:28,679 --> 01:10:31,640
and he's pulling off a big job
to get rid of him.

742
01:10:33,392 --> 01:10:35,394
That's what they say?

743
01:10:37,062 --> 01:10:39,648
Maybe you should
walk away from this one.

744
01:12:07,110 --> 01:12:09,071
What are you doing down here?

745
01:12:09,071 --> 01:12:12,199
Jesus Christ,
you scared the shit out of me.

746
01:12:12,324 --> 01:12:16,036
What the hell are you
doing down here?

747
01:12:16,036 --> 01:12:18,705
Did you involve
Teddy Salida in this?

748
01:12:18,705 --> 01:12:22,167
- What? Teddy Salida?
- Yeah.

749
01:12:22,751 --> 01:12:25,754
- Why would you say that?
- I see these guys outside.

750
01:12:25,837 --> 01:12:28,382
They look like
they might be with him.

751
01:12:29,925 --> 01:12:31,927
How much you into him for?

752
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:33,929
Four million.

753
01:12:35,597 --> 01:12:37,057
Look, how do you think
I got all this?

754
01:12:37,182 --> 01:12:39,559
They gave it to me
and the house in Bermuda?

755
01:12:39,559 --> 01:12:41,937
What's the matter with you?

756
01:12:42,562 --> 01:12:45,107
What's he know?

757
01:12:45,190 --> 01:12:48,235
- About what?
- About what we're doing.

758
01:12:49,277 --> 01:12:52,531
Nothing. I told him I found
something that would go for eight...

759
01:12:52,572 --> 01:12:55,826
and that we'd
split the profits, that's all.

760
01:12:56,952 --> 01:12:59,246
What are you actually
selling the scepter for, Max?

761
01:13:01,665 --> 01:13:04,418
$30 million.

762
01:13:05,377 --> 01:13:09,006
Jesus.
Max, what were you thinking?

763
01:13:09,089 --> 01:13:10,882
What was I thinking?
The same thing you were thinking.

764
01:13:11,091 --> 01:13:16,263
How are we gonna get out from under
all this bullshit we've been living?

765
01:13:16,304 --> 01:13:19,433
The chance came. Took it.

766
01:13:19,516 --> 01:13:22,519
- It's gonna work out fine.
- No, it's not.

767
01:13:22,602 --> 01:13:25,188
- What do you mean, it's not?
- It's not. It's a mess.

768
01:13:25,272 --> 01:13:28,775
- It's not gonna work.
- Wait. Wait a fucking minute.

769
01:13:28,859 --> 01:13:33,030
This is absolutely clean, Nick.
What are you worried about?

770
01:13:33,113 --> 01:13:35,907
Jesus Christ, it's my ass
on the line anyway, not yours.

771
01:13:36,116 --> 01:13:38,201
I'm not taking
the biggest gamble of my life...

772
01:13:38,285 --> 01:13:40,287
so I can hand my money over
to Teddy Salida.

773
01:13:40,328 --> 01:13:43,540
You think you're not gonna get
your fucking money?

774
01:13:43,623 --> 01:13:45,250
Look, there's two things
you gotta know.

775
01:13:45,459 --> 01:13:48,628
One is you're gonna get
every fucking red cent.

776
01:13:48,670 --> 01:13:51,965
And, yeah,
Teddy knows a little.

777
01:13:52,007 --> 01:13:54,134
- He knows?
- He does a little, I said.

778
01:13:54,217 --> 01:13:57,971
- So you did lie?
- Yeah, lied! Shit happens, man!

779
01:13:58,013 --> 01:13:59,848
Christ Almighty!

780
01:13:59,890 --> 01:14:01,933
I lied for you and I lied for me.

781
01:14:01,975 --> 01:14:05,604
I had to say something
to get you to suit up, like always.

782
01:14:10,275 --> 01:14:12,194
I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna do it.

783
01:14:14,363 --> 01:14:17,491
It's a tiny door. Open the door.
Take the shit.

784
01:14:17,574 --> 01:14:19,534
Close the door. We're out.

785
01:14:19,576 --> 01:14:22,162
There's too much bullshit
around it.

786
01:14:39,096 --> 01:14:40,889
What's that?

787
01:14:53,026 --> 01:14:54,903
The buyer.

788
01:14:56,530 --> 01:14:59,282
Real simple. You call him
when you get the scepter.

789
01:15:00,117 --> 01:15:03,036
He'll meet you at the airstrip
30 miles up the St. Lawrence.

790
01:15:03,078 --> 01:15:06,873
There's a little town called
St. Croix.

791
01:15:08,417 --> 01:15:11,086
You give him the scepter,
he gives you the cash.

792
01:15:11,169 --> 01:15:14,589
You take your cut
and you wire me the rest.

793
01:15:14,631 --> 01:15:18,093
I'll give Teddy his,
and you're clean.

794
01:15:22,597 --> 01:15:25,142
It's too risky.

795
01:15:25,225 --> 01:15:27,185
Can't.

796
01:15:30,439 --> 01:15:33,233
You don't know
what you're doing.

797
01:15:33,275 --> 01:15:36,028
You know how long we go back?

798
01:15:38,113 --> 01:15:39,614
Twenty-five years.

799
01:15:42,034 --> 01:15:45,078
I'm gonna tell you something.

800
01:15:45,162 --> 01:15:49,291
For the first time in my life,
I'm scared.

801
01:15:49,332 --> 01:15:51,835
I don't know why it is.
I was never scared before...

802
01:15:51,918 --> 01:15:54,588
but I'm scared now, Nick.

803
01:15:54,796 --> 01:15:58,925
And you're right about Teddy.
He's gonna blow me away if he can.

804
01:15:59,009 --> 01:16:01,094
If I don't get him his money, he--

805
01:16:02,137 --> 01:16:04,514
Man, he--

806
01:16:07,059 --> 01:16:11,646
Hey, don't-don't-don't-don't
let me slide on this one.

807
01:16:11,730 --> 01:16:14,066
I can't afford it, man.

808
01:16:19,780 --> 01:16:23,492
I can't--
I can't scrap it out anymore.

809
01:16:23,575 --> 01:16:25,869
I gotta have some slack.

810
01:16:31,083 --> 01:16:33,126
All right. Okay.

811
01:16:35,504 --> 01:16:37,589
I hope you're not fucking me up.

812
01:16:53,980 --> 01:16:56,066
I'm going down to check the power.

813
01:17:03,657 --> 01:17:07,494
- How much more equipment you got?
- Here you go.

814
01:17:12,290 --> 01:17:13,875
- Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!
- It's okay, Brian.

815
01:17:14,084 --> 01:17:16,294
- Come on in.
- It's my radio.

816
01:17:16,420 --> 01:17:18,547
- Hey, what's all the commotion?
- Don't worry, Danny.

817
01:17:18,672 --> 01:17:20,799
- They're beefing things up.
- What for?

818
01:17:20,882 --> 01:17:23,468
- A few cameras in the basement.
- Like we're gonna lose it, right?

819
01:17:23,510 --> 01:17:25,971
- Lose what?
- That thing in the piano leg.

820
01:17:26,054 --> 01:17:29,975
- The big gold thing?
- Some French national treasure.

821
01:17:30,017 --> 01:17:34,146
- It's called a scepter.
- Some expert saw those pictures.

822
01:17:34,187 --> 01:17:37,733
Now we're getting calls
from the central office.

823
01:17:41,194 --> 01:17:44,489
Hey, it's me.
Yeah, we got a problem.

824
01:17:44,573 --> 01:17:48,410
They got a camera over
the main door here, covering that.

825
01:17:48,493 --> 01:17:51,663
They got a camera here,
looking right across the middle.

826
01:17:51,747 --> 01:17:54,791
They got one special
just on the box...

827
01:17:54,875 --> 01:17:57,210
sees this entire cage.

828
01:17:58,587 --> 01:18:00,714
This camera looking at the box...

829
01:18:00,714 --> 01:18:03,508
how high is it from the floor
and how low is it from the ceiling?

830
01:18:03,592 --> 01:18:07,179
Probably 1 0, 1 2 feet up
off the floor.

831
01:18:07,262 --> 01:18:10,766
Four feet down from the ceiling.
I think we're fucked.

832
01:18:13,101 --> 01:18:15,729
So let me--

833
01:18:15,854 --> 01:18:18,190
When I'm here...

834
01:18:18,273 --> 01:18:21,234
you'll cut the feed when I get
across here, then you'll restore it.

835
01:18:21,276 --> 01:18:23,362
Then when I'm ready here,
you'll cut it again...

836
01:18:23,445 --> 01:18:25,739
and I'll go to work here.

837
01:18:26,782 --> 01:18:28,700
I don't know about that, man.

838
01:18:28,784 --> 01:18:30,952
They know what it is so now they're
gonna move it as soon as they can.

839
01:18:30,994 --> 01:18:35,707
We're not gonna get another chance.
We gotta go now or we don't go at all.

840
01:20:03,378 --> 01:20:05,380
Hi, Doug. Hi.

841
01:20:14,222 --> 01:20:16,725
- Hi, Henri.
- Hi, Brian.

842
01:20:20,437 --> 01:20:23,357
- Okay. Thank you.
- No problem.

843
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:26,068
- Hi, Danny.
- Hello, Brian.

844
01:20:26,151 --> 01:20:30,655
Oh, look at you.
What fancy new shoes.

845
01:20:30,739 --> 01:20:33,492
Yeah. Yeah, my mom
got those for me.

846
01:20:33,575 --> 01:20:38,080
- Oh, your mom gave you those?
- I think you got a girl.

847
01:20:38,121 --> 01:20:40,624
No girl, Danny.
You're a stinker.

848
01:20:41,291 --> 01:20:44,419
Well, you and your new shoes can
give me a hand up on six tonight.

849
01:20:44,419 --> 01:20:47,547
We're gonna wax
the whole cafeteria floor.

850
01:20:47,589 --> 01:20:49,633
You hit the garbage.
I'll get the stuff.

851
01:20:49,675 --> 01:20:52,344
I'll meet you there,
what, 1 5 minutes.

852
01:20:52,427 --> 01:20:54,388
Fifteen. Okay.

853
01:20:54,471 --> 01:21:00,060
Okay, I'll get the garbage, Danny.
Okay? Bye-bye, Andre.

854
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:01,937
Bye-bye.
You look good with those shoes.

855
01:21:02,020 --> 01:21:04,690
Yeah, thanks. I know.

856
01:21:27,587 --> 01:21:29,548
Watch your step out there, Brian.

857
01:21:29,631 --> 01:21:31,591
I will. Thank you.

858
01:25:41,258 --> 01:25:43,927
Okay. Okay, Danny.

859
01:25:44,011 --> 01:25:47,139
- Guess what time it is.
- I don't know.

860
01:25:47,222 --> 01:25:49,516
Yes, you do, Danny!
It's lunchtime!

861
01:25:49,599 --> 01:25:51,727
All right, I'll tell you what.

862
01:25:51,768 --> 01:25:54,604
What do you say we keep on working,
finish the other side, hmm?

863
01:25:54,730 --> 01:25:57,190
No, Danny. Why?

864
01:25:57,232 --> 01:26:00,360
Then we can blow off the rest of
the day and grab some pancakes.

865
01:26:00,569 --> 01:26:03,530
It won't take us long. Just throw
a little extra thinner into the mix.

866
01:26:03,739 --> 01:26:06,658
It'll go like butter.

867
01:26:54,539 --> 01:26:56,416
Danny, I am sorry.

868
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:58,669
It's okay. Just leave it.
I'll mop it up.

869
01:26:58,710 --> 01:27:00,837
- I'll go get some more.
- You don't need to--

870
01:27:00,837 --> 01:27:03,548
- I will get some more.
- All right.

871
01:27:03,632 --> 01:27:05,717
- You know where? Ground floor?
- Okay.

872
01:27:05,801 --> 01:27:07,844
You know the closet?

873
01:27:12,057 --> 01:27:14,393
Set to go. Set to go.

874
01:27:30,075 --> 01:27:31,702
Fuck.

875
01:27:35,747 --> 01:27:38,792
Are you there?
I'm on my mark.

876
01:27:46,383 --> 01:27:48,719
- I'm on. Are you there?
- I'm here. We're running late.

877
01:27:48,802 --> 01:27:50,262
I know. I hit a snag.

878
01:27:52,264 --> 01:27:55,100
I'm already all set up, though.
Just give me one second.

879
01:28:01,314 --> 01:28:04,943
All right, I just gotta punch in
these codes. Just sit tight.

880
01:28:25,130 --> 01:28:26,423
I got it.

881
01:28:26,548 --> 01:28:28,925
Hang on one more beat.

882
01:28:39,269 --> 01:28:41,021
It's clear.
Get in there.

883
01:29:08,215 --> 01:29:12,135
I'm inside the first cage.
Repeat: I am inside the first cage.

884
01:29:19,851 --> 01:29:21,353
You're all clear.

885
01:30:34,926 --> 01:30:38,680
- I'm set. Kill it.
- All right, on my mark.

886
01:30:50,609 --> 01:30:51,777
Go.

887
01:30:56,156 --> 01:30:57,282
I'm here.

888
01:30:59,076 --> 01:31:00,994
There we go.

889
01:31:01,078 --> 01:31:03,455
Perfect. Tell me when
you're in second position.

890
01:33:44,574 --> 01:33:46,451
Fuck.

891
01:34:30,162 --> 01:34:32,831
- How ya doing down there?
- Almost there.

892
01:34:50,307 --> 01:34:52,309
Do you know where is Brian?

893
01:34:53,518 --> 01:34:55,270
No idea.

894
01:35:54,496 --> 01:35:55,288
I'm ready.

895
01:35:56,039 --> 01:35:59,334
I need a second here.
Hold on.

896
01:35:59,918 --> 01:36:02,379
I'm all set. Cut the cameras.
Repeat:

897
01:36:02,462 --> 01:36:04,715
I'm all set.
Cut the cameras.

898
01:36:08,051 --> 01:36:10,178
Gotta go. Got to go.

899
01:36:13,473 --> 01:36:15,559
What's up? What's up?

900
01:36:16,768 --> 01:36:19,563
I got company.
I got company.

901
01:36:21,523 --> 01:36:23,525
Hang on one second.

902
01:36:23,608 --> 01:36:25,360
Just sit tight.
I'll be right back.

903
01:36:57,476 --> 01:36:59,311
Okay.

904
01:37:16,203 --> 01:37:18,205
Jack, where are you?

905
01:37:22,668 --> 01:37:25,128
Jack, come in.Jack.

906
01:37:40,811 --> 01:37:43,313
Jack, are you there?

907
01:38:04,251 --> 01:38:06,253
I'm pulling out.
Repeat: I'm pulling out.

908
01:38:06,294 --> 01:38:08,255
- I'm back. I'm back.
- It's too late.

909
01:38:08,296 --> 01:38:10,590
- I'm pulling out.
- No, it's not. We're good.

910
01:38:10,674 --> 01:38:12,342
Get ready to go.

911
01:38:14,011 --> 01:38:15,470
On my mark.

912
01:38:19,683 --> 01:38:20,809
Go, go, go.

913
01:38:35,282 --> 01:38:37,242
What the hell's wrong
with these machines?

914
01:38:49,880 --> 01:38:52,883
Hey, stop banging on it.
Check the connection.

915
01:39:14,196 --> 01:39:17,532
- You see something?
- I don't know.

916
01:39:36,385 --> 01:39:38,804
Call them.
Call Ironclad.

917
01:39:39,554 --> 01:39:42,641
- And look like idiots?
- I don't care. Call them.

918
01:40:38,238 --> 01:40:40,949
Maybe it's some of the equipment
down in the basement.

919
01:40:43,285 --> 01:40:45,287
Okay. Thanks.

920
01:40:46,997 --> 01:40:49,624
Someone will be here
in a few minutes.

921
01:41:36,088 --> 01:41:38,173
Where are you, kid?

922
01:43:24,404 --> 01:43:27,407
Make a move, make a sound,
and you are dead.

923
01:43:27,449 --> 01:43:29,493
Do you understand me?

924
01:43:31,453 --> 01:43:33,038
Turn around.

925
01:43:37,501 --> 01:43:39,044
Be quiet.

926
01:43:53,517 --> 01:43:55,519
I wish you had not
come down here, man.

927
01:43:59,356 --> 01:44:03,443
Get over there. Turn around.
Come on. Let's go. Turn around.

928
01:44:03,568 --> 01:44:07,447
Walk over there.
Open the door.

929
01:44:07,531 --> 01:44:09,574
Open it.

930
01:44:09,616 --> 01:44:11,535
Get inside.

931
01:44:13,620 --> 01:44:15,539
Look at me.

932
01:44:15,539 --> 01:44:18,041
You're a good man.
I don't want to hurt you.

933
01:44:18,125 --> 01:44:21,044
But if you start making noise or
try to open that door, I will do it.

934
01:44:21,128 --> 01:44:22,629
Do you understand me?

935
01:44:24,923 --> 01:44:28,051
Stay in there and be quiet.
Everything will be fine.

936
01:45:31,490 --> 01:45:33,241
I don't wanna wait.

937
01:45:33,367 --> 01:45:36,161
I want you and Tommy
to go into the basement now.

938
01:45:36,203 --> 01:45:38,455
Come on, Andre.
I'm watching this.

939
01:45:38,580 --> 01:45:40,374
Laurent, please.

940
01:45:42,376 --> 01:45:45,629
Tommy, get Philippe. We're gonna be
checking out the basement again.

941
01:46:30,173 --> 01:46:31,967
Hold it right there!

942
01:46:32,092 --> 01:46:34,219
- Are you crazy?
- Take it off and put it down.

943
01:46:34,386 --> 01:46:38,348
- Aw, come on.
- Take it off and put it down now!

944
01:46:38,390 --> 01:46:41,810
- Don't do this.
- Take it off and put it down!

945
01:46:41,893 --> 01:46:43,854
- Please, don't--
- Don't fucking argue with me.

946
01:46:43,937 --> 01:46:46,565
Take it off and put it down.

947
01:46:46,690 --> 01:46:48,316
I can't. I can't.

948
01:46:49,609 --> 01:46:52,779
I'll put the next one in your knee.
I don't have time to fuck around.

949
01:46:52,821 --> 01:46:56,116
We can work out the details later.
I am leaving with that scepter.

950
01:46:57,451 --> 01:47:01,538
Now, take it off
and hand it over right now!

951
01:47:08,754 --> 01:47:12,299
Put it down. Slowly.

952
01:47:13,050 --> 01:47:15,302
Now, step back.
Back up.

953
01:47:24,269 --> 01:47:26,188
- Take off your mask.
- What?

954
01:47:26,313 --> 01:47:27,773
Take it off!

955
01:47:29,441 --> 01:47:32,778
I don't have time to play games.
Take it off.

956
01:47:45,123 --> 01:47:47,042
Throw it over there.

957
01:47:49,169 --> 01:47:51,380
Step in the middle.

958
01:47:51,380 --> 01:47:53,799
Step in the middle.
That's right.

959
01:47:57,469 --> 01:48:01,515
We wouldn't be here if you'd thrown
me some respect at the beginning.

960
01:48:01,598 --> 01:48:03,558
- Just a little bit.
- This is a stupid move.

961
01:48:03,642 --> 01:48:05,185
- It is? Why?
- We all come out ahead.

962
01:48:05,268 --> 01:48:07,729
What are you doing?
Just go up there and finish--

963
01:48:07,813 --> 01:48:09,356
It's a long shot.
I should play it tight.

964
01:48:09,439 --> 01:48:11,358
You know what I think
of your bullshit advice?

965
01:48:11,441 --> 01:48:14,569
I think that's you trying to talk me
into taking a sucker's share...

966
01:48:14,653 --> 01:48:17,864
on a score that I set up
from the beginning!

967
01:48:19,366 --> 01:48:23,453
You think I'm stupid, that I don't
see what you and Max are doing?

968
01:48:25,122 --> 01:48:28,750
I mean, what is he giving you?
Five, six million?

969
01:48:28,875 --> 01:48:31,294
Tell me that's not true.

970
01:48:31,378 --> 01:48:33,588
See, that doesn't work for me.

971
01:48:35,173 --> 01:48:40,053
I appreciate your help,
but you should've made me a partner.

972
01:48:40,137 --> 01:48:42,180
Now I gotta take a shot.

973
01:48:47,894 --> 01:48:51,356
Just sit tight. Just sit tight.
Everything will be fine.

974
01:48:55,360 --> 01:48:58,989
Now you got a choice. You can
either head for that tunnel...

975
01:48:59,031 --> 01:49:00,949
or smile for that camera.

976
01:49:09,541 --> 01:49:11,043
Andre, what's happening?

977
01:49:11,168 --> 01:49:12,711
Get down!
Go to the basement!

978
01:49:12,878 --> 01:49:15,464
We're being robbed!
We're being robbed!

979
01:49:20,427 --> 01:49:23,472
Henri, quick! Go outside!
Wait for the police!

980
01:49:30,979 --> 01:49:32,773
Let's go!
Go! Go! Go! Go!

981
01:50:04,179 --> 01:50:06,264
Over here! Over here!

982
01:50:10,435 --> 01:50:14,606
- He's in the tunnel!
- Where is he?

983
01:50:17,025 --> 01:50:18,402
Find him!

984
01:50:35,377 --> 01:50:37,504
- Back there!
- Okay!

985
01:50:37,546 --> 01:50:39,589
Come on! Come on! Come on!

986
01:51:23,592 --> 01:51:26,303
- Andre!
- Oh, shit.

987
01:51:26,386 --> 01:51:28,472
- Andre, is there a fire?
- It's okay.

988
01:51:32,392 --> 01:51:34,311
- Where's Danny?
- Just get out!

989
01:51:34,353 --> 01:51:36,772
- Okay.
- Just wait outside.

990
01:51:40,275 --> 01:51:43,737
- Just wait outside!
- Okay, bye-bye.

991
01:51:46,865 --> 01:51:49,242
Wait, Brian, wait!

992
01:51:49,284 --> 01:51:51,036
Get back, Brian!

993
01:51:53,622 --> 01:51:56,375
It's Brian! It's Brian!

994
01:51:56,416 --> 01:52:00,253
- Have you seen Brian?
- He's okay! He's outside!

995
01:52:00,337 --> 01:52:02,506
No! My God, it's him!

996
01:52:04,591 --> 01:52:07,386
It's okay now.
It's okay.

997
01:54:39,246 --> 01:54:43,083
Attention. The bus to Albany,
New York leaves in five--

998
01:54:45,085 --> 01:54:46,086
Yeah?

999
01:54:46,169 --> 01:54:48,422
- Hey, did you make it?
- Fuck you.

1000
01:54:49,840 --> 01:54:51,800
Come on. I'm just checking
to make sure you got out okay.

1001
01:54:51,842 --> 01:54:53,802
I knew you'd give 'em the slip.

1002
01:54:55,012 --> 01:54:56,972
I'm almost home, too, here,
by the way.

1003
01:54:57,055 --> 01:54:58,849
Oh, you are, huh?
You sure about that?

1004
01:54:58,932 --> 01:55:02,394
Look, whatever you're thinking
about, just forget it, okay?

1005
01:55:02,477 --> 01:55:04,479
This is over now
and you just gotta deal with it.

1006
01:55:04,521 --> 01:55:08,066
It's not over yet 'cause you don't
know where you're going, and I do.

1007
01:55:08,150 --> 01:55:10,068
- You don't know shit!
- You know where you're going?

1008
01:55:10,152 --> 01:55:14,740
I'm five minutes from being gone.
You can't imagine where I'm going.

1009
01:55:14,823 --> 01:55:17,576
- You got nothing.
- You know what I got.

1010
01:55:17,659 --> 01:55:19,786
You just can't deal with the fact
that I beat you.

1011
01:55:19,870 --> 01:55:23,957
Oh, yeah? What have you got?
Huh? What have you got?

1012
01:55:24,041 --> 01:55:26,084
You know what I've got.

1013
01:55:55,072 --> 01:55:56,323
Let me ask you something.

1014
01:55:56,406 --> 01:55:59,826
When did you start thinking
you were better than me, huh?

1015
01:55:59,910 --> 01:56:01,078
You still there, ace?

1016
01:56:02,829 --> 01:56:05,832
Okay. Nicely done.

1017
01:56:05,916 --> 01:56:08,543
Nicely done.
Now let's talk about this.

1018
01:56:08,627 --> 01:56:11,004
Okay, let's see. How'd you put it?
'' Deal with it. It's over.''

1019
01:56:11,088 --> 01:56:14,216
No, I don't think so. You want me
to list the ways I can burn you?

1020
01:56:14,257 --> 01:56:17,427
We either work this out right now,
or I will take you down.

1021
01:56:17,511 --> 01:56:20,931
Oh, yeah? How?
My shop, my tools, they're gone.

1022
01:56:21,014 --> 01:56:23,767
Me, my friend, I'm just
a taxpaying jazz club owner.

1023
01:56:23,850 --> 01:56:26,853
You? Every cop in the city's
looking for you right about now.

1024
01:56:27,604 --> 01:56:30,899
So if I were you, I'd quit
making threats and hit the road.

1025
01:56:34,861 --> 01:56:36,905
Nice working with you, ace.

1026
01:56:36,947 --> 01:56:39,241
Okay, bye-bye.

1027
01:57:12,149 --> 01:57:15,027
Montreal was stunned
by the daring predawn robbery...

1028
01:57:15,068 --> 01:57:17,946
of the old city's historic
customshouse.

1029
01:57:18,030 --> 01:57:21,575
A priceless scepter was stolen.
A senior night janitor...

1030
01:57:21,658 --> 01:57:23,577
identified this man...

1031
01:57:23,660 --> 01:57:25,579
as the prime suspect
in the burglary.

1032
01:57:25,662 --> 01:57:28,874
He was spotted leaving the scene
moments after the robbery...

1033
01:57:28,957 --> 01:57:31,418
and is now the focus
of a massive manhunt.

1034
01:57:31,460 --> 01:57:35,213
A second suspect vanished
from the scene without a trace.

1035
01:57:35,297 --> 01:57:38,467
Police have no solid leads.
