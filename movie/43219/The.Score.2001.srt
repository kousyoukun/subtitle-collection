你那一趟愉快吗?
Did you have a good trip?

40
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:42,910
呃 一定没你这一趟好玩
Well, not as interesting as yours, I'm sure.

41
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:47,580
天啊! 让我看看你
My God! Let me get a look at you.

42
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:50,160
你脸色好惨 怎么了?
You look like shit. What's your secret?

尚克劳 请你清出第二桌
Jean-Claude, set up number two for us.

Yeah, sure.

45
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:59,010
你可以走了
You can go now.

46
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,805
谢谢
Thank you.

47
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,300
请让我们单独呆着 谢谢
Just give us a little room. Thank you.

48
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:09,520
好的
For sure.

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,520
来了
There we are.

50
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:17,990
百慕达
Bermuda.

51
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,240
哦 老天
Oh, God.

52
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:30,500
- 外头风声挺紧的 - 很好 可以令你提高警觉
- It was pretty tight out there. - Good. It'll keep you sharp.

53
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,670
出了小状况
I got a minor development.

54
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,590
- 买主没了 - 你说"没了"是什么意思?
- We lost the buyer. - What do you mean, "lost"?

55
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,390
呃 她进了棺材 她挂了...
Well, she's in a brass casket six feet underground...

56
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,640
不会再有消息了
never to be heard from again.

57
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,640
我先垫了两万花费
Well, I fronted 20, 000 in expenses.

58
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:50,400
现在事情办妥了 我应得25万
Now I'm due that, plus 250 for my end.

59
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,480
你以为我会坑你的钱吗?
You don't think I'm not gonna take care of you?

60
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,530
我得包了你的所有开销吗?
I'm not gonna cover your expenses and all that?

61
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:58,200
不是包了我的开销 是钱的问题 你得另找买主
It's not about covering my expenses. It's the money. Find another buyer.

62
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,700
当然了 但老天 世事难料
Of course. But Jesus Christ, shit happens.

63
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,910
这会拖一阵子 耐心等吧
This thing's gonna drag out. You've got to be patient.

64
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,960
等一下 这样如何?
Wait a minute. How about this?

65
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,080
我有一票包你赚四百万块
Four big ones in your hand.

66
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:12,460
你会到手四百万
Four million dollars in your mitt.

67
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,800
- 四百万? - 你作梦都没想到
- Four million? - More than you ever dreamed of.

68
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,760
比以前我们联手干的更多
More than we ever, ever did together.

69
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,010
四百万 你到底看上什么?
Four million. What are you into?

70
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:24,310
我看上一样不得了的宝物
Well, I spotted this item which was really exceptional.

71
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:28,270
欧洲来的古董 上品...
It was European antiquity, elegant...

72
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:31,110
拥有它的蠢货...
and it was in the hands of this real dumb prick...

73
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:32,780
根本搞不清状况
that didn't know what he had.

74
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,860
只可惜...
And unfortunately...

75
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,360
它被扣住了
it's become detained in transit a little.

76
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,950
你不想知道在哪儿吗?
You don't wanna know where?

77
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,750
这要看情况
It depends.

78
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:47,330
看什么情况?
Depends on what?

79
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:50,420
- 看你要告诉我什么 - 好吧
- On what you're gonna tell me. - Okay.

80
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,800
它被锁在蒙特娄海关大楼
It's in the Montreal Customshouse.

81
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:55,890
不行
No Way.

82
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:00,050
- 不行 抱歉 - 哦 好 等一下
- No way. I'm sorry. - Oh, yeah. Wait a minute.

83
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,100
我有个人...我有个内钱
I got a guy...I got a guy inside.

84
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:07,600
能提供大楼平面图 搞定保全系统 所有的...
He gives you the whole layout, handles security, everything...

85
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:12,650
你老是说"到任何地方偷都行 在美国 欧洲都行
You used to tell me, "Steal outside the country, in the States, Europe.

86
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,240
就是别在自己的家乱来"
But Montreal, live in Montreal."

87
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,950
我说过很多蠢话 是不是?
I said a lot of dumb things in my day, didn't I?

88
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,320
- 是 不过... - 对
- But that's... - Right.

89
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:24,160
先找这一票的买主吧 我得开店了
Let's just find another buyer for this. I gotta open the place.

90
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,040
好 不过我还没说完
Okay, but I'm not finished talking about this.

91
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:30,035
尚克劳 艾柏 来吧
Jean-Claude, Albert, come on.

92
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,840
你这是错失良机
You're making a large error here.

93
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,140
不赖
Not bad.

94
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:54,820
- 谁? - 我刚到
- Yeah? - I just landed.

95
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,820
东西带来了
I got the delivery.

96
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:20,350
东西在你身上?
Got the bag?

97
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:23,230
- 对 就在这儿 - 强尼呢?
- Yeah. Right here. - Where's Johnny?

98
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:26,650
他在伊斯坦堡被干掉了
He got it in Istanbul, right through the neck.

99
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:28,940
- 老天 他是个好孩子 - 是
- Jesus. He was a good kid. - Yeah.

100
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,740
他也翘辫子了
Good and dead.

101
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,780
你想谈还是看我有什么?
So you wanna talk, or you wanna see what I got?

102
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,320
我怎么知道你没问题?
How can I be sure you're okay?

103
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,290
你上了我就知道
I suppose I could fuck you.

104
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,580
这样也好
That would work.

105
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:04,310
嘿 你还好吧?
Hey. You okay?

106
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,940
对 很好
Yeah. Great.

107
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:15,330
- 这一趟好吗? - 不晓得
- How was your trip? - I don't know.

108
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,290
都市
Cities.

109
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:22,380
看起来全都一个样子 真的是
They're all starting to look the same. They really are.

110
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:32,680
罗马的意大利面没你煮的好吃
And the pasta in Rome is not as good as yours.

111
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,430
那些色狼
And the ass pinchers.

112
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,060
在欧洲曾经看上去那么有魅力
They used to look so charmingly European.

113
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,060
没我煮的好吃?
Not as good as me?

114
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,530
得了吧
Come on.

115
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,700
我一定就是喜欢你这点...
It really must be what it is about you I like...

116
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:53,240
你跟平常人不一样
because you most definitely are not common.

117
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:02,290
- 要是一样呢? - 什么意思?
- What if I were? - What if you were what?

118
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:05,420
要是我跟平常人一样常在家
A little more common, you know, and around more.

119
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:07,420
多常在家?
How much more?

120
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,590
比如 "成天"都在家
Like, "all the time" more.

121
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,050
我只当爵士吧老板 不当小偷
And I was just a jazz club owner and not that other thing.

122
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,470
你觉得怎样?
How would you feel about that?

123
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,520
嘿 你说的跟我想的一样吗?
Hey, are you saying what I think you're saying?

124
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,150
我说的就是那意思
I think that's what I'm saying.

125
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:29,820
宝贝 我没要你改变 尤其是为了我
Hey, baby, you know I've never asked you to change anything for me.

126
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:32,990
我知道 我只问你觉得怎样?
I know that. I'm just asking you, how would you feel about that?

127
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,670
我不知道
I don't know.

128
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:48,010
我得认真想想
I suppose I'd have to give it some serious thought.

129
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,930
那你最好认真想一想
Then you'd better start giving it some serious thought.

130
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:05,860
谢了 那就到时再见啦?
Thank you. So I'll see you when I see you?

131
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,860
到时候见
See you when I see you.

132
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,840
Madame.
太太

133
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,240
Voila. Have a good day.
给 祝您过得愉快

134
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,580
Merci.
谢谢

135
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:50,240
对不起 你可以帮我吗?
Excuse me. Can you help me, please?

136
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:53,500
你可以帮我吗?
Can you help me?

137
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,710
- 诺门广场? - 对 对
- Place Norman? - Yes, yes.

138
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:58,290
这个街口右转走两条街...
You go to the corner, make a right. Go two blocks...

139
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:01,550
- 两条 - 两条街 然后左转走一条街
- Two. - Two blocks, then a left one block.

140
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:04,130
- 请再说一遍 - 这边走两条街...
- Again, please. - Two blocks this way...

141
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,720
再左转一条街
one block that way to the left.

142
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,350
- 然后就到了 - 好 谢谢你
- And you're right there. - Okay, thank you.

143
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:09,970
谢谢你 尼克
Thank you, Nick.

144
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,060
你说什么?
What did you say?

145
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,650
我说 "谢谢你 尼克"
I said, "Thank you, Nick."

146
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:23,070
我就是麦斯的内线 我们得谈谈
I'm Max's guy in the customshouse. We should talk.

147
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:26,620
再见 谢谢你 再见
Okay, bye-bye. Thank you.

148
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,620
谢谢你 再见
Thank you. Bye.

149
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:37,460
- 麦斯呢? - 他在里面
- Where's Max? - He's in the sunroom.

150
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,540
麦斯
Max

151
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,180
尼克 尼克
Nicoli, Nicoli.

152
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,430
你疯了吗?
Have you lost your fucking mind?

153
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:49,470
我? 早就疯了 怎么了?
My mind? Years ago. Why?

154
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,480
- 你跟这小子说了什么? - 跟谁说?
- What did you tell this kid? - What did I tell who?

155
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,520
你那个装智障的内线
Your inside guy with the retard act.

156
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,690
他跑到我家 他认得我
He was in front of my house. He knew who I was.

157
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:02,610
他一定跟了我到酒吧 在那里见到你
Wait. He must've followed me to the club and made you from there.

158
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,120
他再玩这把戏我就让他进医院
Tell him he pulls a stunt like that again, he'll end up in the hospital.

159
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,370
慢着 你以为我 会找个笨蛋跟你合作吗?
Wait. Do you think I'm gonna set you up with a jerk-off heister?

160
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:12,750
- 你得承认这小子有两把刷子 - 你疯了?
- You gotta admit that this kid did a pretty good dog and pony show. - Are you crazy?

161
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:16,630
就算他很高竿 你也不能让我曝光
I don't care who is he. Don't expose me like that. You know better.

162
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,170
他都搞定了
He's got it all pre-wired.

163
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,590
- 你只要进去拿货... - 我说过我没兴趣
- You go in, turn the key... - I told you, I'm not interested.

164
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:24,010
这么大的一票机会难得
You're never gonna get another chance at a score like this.

165
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:26,050
- 你干嘛逼我? - 四百万
- Why are you pushing this? - Four million balls.

166
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,930
你要我说多少遍?
How many times do I have to tell you?

167
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,730
那是因为时间不多
He's pushing it because we're running out of time.

168
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:33,560
真要干的话就得赶快计划...
If I'm gonna work with a partner on this...

169
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,480
我们得立马开始合作了
we gotta start putting our heads together right away.

170
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:37,030
- 你跑来干嘛? - 别抓狂
- What are you doing in my house? - Take it easy.

171
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:39,820
- 我只是说... - 这臭小子是谁?
- All I'm saying... - Who the fuck is this kid?

172
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,570
- 你知道什么? - 我花了三个礼拜摸清一切
- What the fuck do you know? - I've been on this for three weeks.

173
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:45,620
我得知道你行不行
I gotta know if you're the guy that Max says you are.

174
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,870
- 我要走了 - 尼克 等等 等等
- I gotta go. - Nick, wait. Wait.

175
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:54,130
我大老远跑来...我是杰克泰勒 幸会
I didn't come 500 miles just to...Jack Teller. Nice to meet you too.

176
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:55,130
搞什么?
What the fuck?

177
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:57,960
你这没长胡须的小毛头
You're not smart enough to know where your dick is.

178
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:01,220
我叫你等我通知
We decided that you were gonna sit tight until I called you.

179
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,640
- 对不对? - 好的
- Is that correct? - Okay.

180
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,470
我只想帮你说服他 还以为你说他答应了
I thought I could help you sell him on it. I thought he was already in.

181
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:09,020
你创作力别这么丰富 给我滚出去
Don't be so fucking creative. Just get the fuck out of my house.

182
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,690
你把他搞定了再通知我 好吗?
When you guys get your shit together, give me a call, okay?

183
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:14,020
不可思议
Unbelievable.

184
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:23,410
#It's a lucky thing you came my way#

185
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,790
#Today#

186
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:30,920
#I'm about to tell you something you should know#

187
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,840
#All you have to do is let the plot unfold#

188
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,180
#Desire is clear#

189
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,890
#When you are near#

190
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:46,930
#You're about to give in#

191
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,730
#Don't tease me so#

192
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,280
#I think you know#

193
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,530
#You're about to give in#

194
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:02,870
#And if you listen we can both find peace#

195
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,080
#Release#

196
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,710
#Inhibitions that you thought could not be there#

197
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:20,860
天啊!
Jesus!

198
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,660
老天! 老天! 快住手
God! Jesus! Take it easy.

199
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,960
给我听好 你今晚走了就别回来
Listen close. Leave town tonight. Don't come back.

200
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,170
我再看到你 就打断你的狗腿
I see you again, I break your fucking knees.

201
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,720
你再去找尼克 我就宰了你
I see you around Nick, I'll kill ya.

202
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,850
你玩的游戏太危险了
It's a dangerous fucking game you're playing here.

203
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:39,600
知道了吗?
Are we clear?

204
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,520
是 我知道了
Yeah, we're clear.

205
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,400
怎么样?
How did it go?

206
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:31,900
出了状况
Not as planned.

207
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:37,080
- 你要什么? - 我要你先尊重我一点 怎么样?
- What do you want? - Some fucking respect for starters. How about that?

208
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:41,910
你干嘛? 我可是在工作
I mean, what are you thinking? Now, I'm on a job here.

209
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,920
你不想参一脚 没问题 就直说"不"
Now, if you just don't wanna come in on it, that's fine. Say "no."

210
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,880
别派三流打手打发我
But don't send some third-rate rent-a-thug to brush me off.

211
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,590
有点专业精神
You can do it like a professional.

212
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,050
你好
Hello.

213
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:57,310
对 你没事吧?
Yeah. You okay?

214
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:59,850
他在这儿 放心 你先回家
He's right here. Don't worry. Just go home.

215
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:03,150
我再打给你 好的? 没关系
I'll call you later, all right? That's okay.

216
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,650
好的
Okay.

217
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:07,940
我不是来惹麻烦的
I didn't come here to cause any trouble.

218
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,440
我不是
I didn't.

219
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:14,370
我在街上堵你是很蠢
Coming up to you on the street like that, that was a stupid move.

220
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:16,700
对不起 为什么不算扯平了呢?
Sorry. Why don't we just call it even?

221
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:19,330
我说完了就走
I just wanna say one thing to you, then I'll go away.

222
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:21,920
你不参加就不会再见到我
We don't have to bother each other anymore if you don't want.

223
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,090
这一票我探了几个礼拜的路
I have been casing this place for a couple of weeks now.

224
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:31,840
难度很高 但是很有可行性
It's a little bit complicated, but this is a very doable job.

225
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:35,180
我搞定保全 另一个人可以去开保险柜
I can handle the system in there if someone can break into this box.

226
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,930
听着 我们不认识对方
Look, I don't know you, you don't know me.

227
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:41,480
我知道这并不是最好的方法 但...
I know that's not the best way to do things, but...

228
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,150
我很擅长我做的事情 知道吗?
I am very good at what I do, okay?

229
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:47,990
而且我会非常非常认真的 你可以问麦斯
And I take it very, very seriously. You can check it out with Max.

230
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:51,280
如果你真像他说的是神偷...
Now, if you are the guy that he says you are...

231
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,160
那你就应该考虑一下
then we should check this out.

232
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,160
就...就来看一下
Just...Just take a look at it.

233
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:59,160
这是一大票 但风险也很大...
That's all I'm saying, 'cause this is a very big payoff...

234
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,170
也是可以接受的
for very acceptable risks.

235
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,390
去看看 你自己去看看
Just take a look at it. Go look for yourself.

236
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:16,730
这地方很棒
I like your place.

237
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:18,730
你很有品味
You got good taste.

238
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:01,090
这儿好暗 老是阴森森的
Oh, Jesus. It's nice and dark in here.

239
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:03,135
去死吧
Fucking everything.

240
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:06,140
- 嘿 尼克 - 麦斯
- Hey, Nicoli - Max

241
00:29:06,175 --> 00:29:07,970
老天
Jesus.

242
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:10,720
你开个灯会死吗?
Why don't you jump for some lights in this place?

243
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:15,440
这么暗我都得跟你玩躲猫猫
Every time I come in here, it's like hide-and-go-seek.

244
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,440
你好吗?
How are you?

245
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:33,120
那么 你要说出...
Now, you gotta tell me the...

246
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,830
那个神奇的字了吗
the magic word.

247
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,750
好 我答应
All right, I'm gonna do it.

248
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,970
太好了 你真是大好人
Good, good. Jesus, sweetheart. You're a sweetheart.

249
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:43,970
棒呆了 这才像话
Bravo. You're making sense.

250
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:49,010
但风险太大 我要分六百万
But because of the risk involved, my end's gotta be six million.

251
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,100
总机小姐?
Operator?

252
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:55,980
有个疯子要六百万
I got a nut down here that just said six million.

253
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,150
不 不 快派救护车来 我觉得...你没事吧?
No, no. Send paramedics. I think...Are you all right?

254
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,280
我很好
I'm fine.

255
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,030
六百万? 不是四百万吗?
Six fucking million dollars? What happened to four?

256
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:07,740
这是我家 酬劳太少我是不会干的
I'm doing it in my backyard. I'm not gonna go like that. I'm sorry.

257
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:09,750
你要我做 就得给我公道酬劳
If you want me to do this, you gotta pay me what's right.

258
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:12,870
- 就得那样 - 我给你的酬劳一直很公道
- It's gotta be that way. - I always pay you what's right.

259
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,210
你以为很公道 其实并不是
You always think you do. I always know what you pay me.

260
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:19,050
这次我要这个数目
It's not always right. I need this for this.

261
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,090
我很欣赏你
I like your style.

262
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,090
对 呃 好的 我了解
Yeah, well, okay. I understand.

263
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,930
那是我得做的 我想付清爵士吧的贷款
That's what I have to do. I wanna pay off the club, the mortgage.

264
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,730
完全拥有这地方
I wanna own this place free and clear.

265
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:33,310
我希望它是我的 过我想要的生活
I want it to be mine. I live the way I want.

266
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,690
因为此后我要洗手不干了
Because after this, no more jobs.

267
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:38,030
这一票以后我就不干了
This is the last one I'm doing. I'm quitting for good.

268
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:40,820
25年来你说过多少次?
How many times have you told me that in 25 years?

269
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:43,200
除非猪把我兄弟吃了我才会相信
I'm gonna believe that when the pigs eat my brother.

270
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,540
- 真的? - 我真的不干了
- Right? - I'm done. I'm done. No more.

271
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:52,380
呃 好吧 希望她值得你这么做
Well, okay. I hope she's worth it.

272
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,420
菜鸟来了
Here's numb-nuts.

273
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:04,220
好房子 好酒吧 你一定很高竿
Nice house, nice club. You must be really good.

274
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:09,560
很抱歉 我要搜你身
I don't wanna have to do this, but raise your arms.

275
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:15,270
- 请便 - 他没问题的了
- Be my guest. - He's all right.

276
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:20,030
可以了吗?
Okay?

277
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,080
这是正式的招集吗? 你把我们找来干嘛?
Is this a social call? What are we doing here?

278
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:33,710
我会跟你一起研究这事...
I will explore this with you...

279
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:36,590
但这一票的每个细节都由我作主
but I run this operation down to the smallest detail.

280
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:39,930
如果对此有意见 我们就拍拍屁股回家
If you have a problem with that, we can all go home right now.

281
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,390
有问题吗?
Is there a problem with that?

282
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:45,270
没有
That's fine.

283
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:48,390
我会根据你的资料着手计划
You will tell me everything you know, then I will design the plan.

284
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:52,310
只要有一点蹊跷我就走人
If I smell something about the job or you that I don't like, I walk.

285
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,480
如果有一秒我觉得你会搞不定...
If I think for one second you're not living up to your end of it...

286
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:58,320
或是有事瞒着我 我也马上走人
or if you hold out on me in any way, I walk.

287
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,910
- 懂吗? - 没问题
- Understood? - That's fine.

288
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:02,530
告诉我你想知道什么
Tell me what you wanna know.

289
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:07,830
- 首先 目标是什么? - 你知道权杖吗?
- First, what are we looking for? - You know what a scepter is?

290
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:09,880
国王的宝杖
It's something that a king holds.

291
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,670
这玩意
Right there.

292
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:17,050
1661年在法国加冕典礼上...
It was made in 1661 in France for a special coronation...

293
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,930
一个少女国王用过的
for a girl queen.

294
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:23,850
- 这是无价之宝 - 对我们来说还是有价
- It's priceless. - Not to us, it's not.

295
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:26,980
说说它存放的位置?
What can you give me on its specific location?

296
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:29,350
我做过功课 我探过整栋大楼 知道不? 我有平面图
I can give you the whole building, okay? I got floor plans.

297
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,070
我花了三周时间 把保全系统也摸透了
I've been clocking the security patterns for over three weeks.

298
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,280
好吧 你说说看
All right. Paint me a picture.

299
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:38,160
好的 我在里面找到一个工作
Okay. He fixed me up with the job.

300
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,700
不是我 是我装的智障布莱恩
Not me but Brian, the guy on the street.

301
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,120
是的 我记得
Yeah, I remember.

302
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,000
他能追踪吗? 有电话? 地址? 之类的?
Is he traceable? Phone number? Address? That stuff?

303
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,420
没有 他们是可怜他才雇用他
It's totally tight. The guy's a charity case, a favor.

304
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,500
文件上根本没他的资料
The guy truly doesn't even exist on paper.

305
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:52,630
他刚出现 他是清洁工...
He just shows up. He's the assistant janitor...

306
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:54,470
从午夜做到八点
midnight to 8 a.m.

307
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:01,470
保全系统很简单
The security's pretty basic.

308
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,020
晚上把一楼的门窗锁紧
At night, they lock the place down. They bar the ground floor windows.

309
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:07,650
唯一的入口是缷货区
You can only enter in through one place, out by the truck court.

310
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:13,860
谢谢你 阿布 谢谢
Thank you, Hubert. Thank you.

311
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:16,660
人手很少 外面的警卫室只有一个人...
Manpower's very light. They got one guy sitting in a booth outside...

312
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:19,120
在盯着
just keeping an eye on things.

313
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:24,710
里面有一具金属探测器
On the inside, everyone comes in through a standard metal detector.

314
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:28,840
很难挟带什么 但是我有办法
It's tricky bringing things through, but I've got that figured out.

315
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,670
警卫跟我很熟 不太会查我
All the guards know me now, so no one really looks too close.

316
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:34,050
- 好 谢谢 - 没什么
- Okay, thank you. - All right.

317
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:36,470
我进去之后 哪儿都能去
Once I'm inside, I can go anywhere I want.

318
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:38,010
嘿 罗伦
Hey, Laurent.

319
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:41,770
小小的中央指挥台控制一切
Everything gets run from this one little central command console.

320
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:45,690
电梯和走廊有固定监看摄影机
They've got fixed video systems in the elevators and in the hallways.

321
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:48,820
有几道磁门 但是都很简单
They got a couple magnetic doors, but it's all very basic.

322
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:52,490
以前常常加班 现在比较少
Lots of overtime. Not so much now.

323
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:54,860
清洁工是一个叫丹尼的老头
Now, the head janitor's this old guy, Danny.

324
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:57,280
他很疼布莱恩
He loves Brian. Loves him.

325
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:59,740
这人完全在我的掌控下
I've got this guy completely wrapped around my finger.

326
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:02,250
他会为我做任何事
He'd do anything for me.

327
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,330
大多数时间 他让我跟他一起工作
And most of the time, he's got me working with him.

328
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:06,210
简单的清洁工作
Kind of low-level shit, just helping out.

329
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:09,630
不过我有很多藉口走开
But I can get away from him plenty. I got all kinds of reasons.

330
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:13,180
我有平面图 也拷贝了钥匙
I've sketched half the place already. I've copied a lot of keys.

331
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,430
基本上每个房间都进得去
I can get you access to basically any room in the place.

332
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:18,060
宝杖在哪里?
Where's the scepter?

333
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:21,020
麻烦的就在这儿
Well, see, that's the kink.

334
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,640
那你听好了
Now, get this.

335
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:25,650
它被送到城里是藏在了...
It was arranged to be brought into the country...

336
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:29,730
一架古董钢琴的脚柱里
inside the leg of an antique piano.

337
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:33,570
本来很简单 但是这批古董却被扣押
And it was so simple. Then they impounded it.

338
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:35,620
我是说 你猜怎么着?
I mean, can you guess why?

339
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:38,490
该死的虫子
Fucking bugs.

340
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:42,080
我是说 整批货都有白蚁
I mean, the whole shipment was contaminated with termites.

341
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,130
亚洲产长角白蚁
Asian longhorn beetles.

342
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:47,130
我们被虫虫害惨了
We got fucked by bugs.

343
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:51,090
这些白蚁钻进...
These things burrow into the wood...

344
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:53,050
整批货的木箱
so they were in the crates of most of the shipment.

345
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:55,600
多数的古董都被取出运走
So they took the goods out and delivered most of them.

346
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:58,470
但钢琴也是木制的 所以遭到扣押
But the piano is made of wood too, so they impounded it.

347
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,730
他们扣押了所有的东西 并隔离起来了
They took the whole thing and put it in quarantine.

348
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:03,440
中级安全指数 锁在三楼
Medium security, third-floor lockup.

349
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,060
他们很怕白蚁...
They're really scared of these things...

350
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,820
不敢送回法国
and they can't send them back to France.

351
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:11,650
所以决定烧毁一切
So they decided to burn everything.

352
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,670
现在 我跟你说...
Now, I'll tell ya...

353
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:25,040
我不知道宝杖藏在哪一根脚柱...
I didn't know which one of the fucking legs this thing is in...

354
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:28,260
我很想抓了四根脚柱就跑
but half of me was tempted to grab them all and make a break for it.

355
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:32,180
它随时都可能被熔化
I mean, I don't know if this thing's gonna melt or what.

356
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,510
我是说 我快急死了
I mean, I was dying.

357
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:41,400
最后我灵机一动
I had to improvise a little.

358
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:48,400
- 罗伦...你看那堆火 - 它在烧
- I-I saw something in the fire. - We're just burning stuff.

359
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:52,700
不 看 你看 我看到钢琴里...
No. Look, look. I saw something in the...

360
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:56,120
有东西 在钢琴里 我看到个...看
Piano. In the piano, I saw a...Look.

361
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,290
- 我看到东西 - 杰克!
- I saw something. - Jack!

362
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,790
那儿! 那儿!
There! There!

363
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,880
这是什么?
What is it?

364
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:16,180
大家慌了手脚
So everybody's freaking out.

365
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,310
不知道怎么办
Nobody knows what this is or what to do with it.

366
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:20,310
他们没碰过这种大事
They don't see this kind of excitement down there.

367
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,400
于是他们马上把主管叫来 他们把他从床上叫起来
So they call some supervisor. They get him out of bed.

368
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,900
他来了 看了看
He comes down, he takes one look at this thing.

369
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:28,110
他也搞不懂 只知道它很值钱
He doesn't know what the hell it is, but he knows it's worth a lot.

370
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,200
他吩咐把它锁在地下室保险柜
He tells them, until they can sort it out, put it in the basement.

371
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:34,120
- 他们也照办了 - 别担心了 别担心
- And that's what they do. - Don't worry. Don't worry.

372
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,660
- 别担心 - 我想看看 丹尼
- Don't worry about it. - I want to see, Danny.

373
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:39,460
- 我能看到吗? - 不 来吧 我们走吧
- Can I see? - No. Come on. Let's go now.

374
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,960
好 再见 再见
Okay. Bye-bye. Bye.

375
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,060
海关大楼地下室...
The basement in the customshouse...

376
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,440
是东加拿大门禁最森严的地方
is the most secure lockup in eastern Canada.

377
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,940
冷战期间是核战避难所
It was built as a bomb shelter during the Cold War.

378
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:07,490
贵重物品都锁在那儿...物证 毒品...
All their important stuff's there...state's evidence, narcotics...

379
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:09,320
走私枪械
confiscated weapons.

380
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:12,160
宝杖在某个保险柜里
That scepter is in a safe somewhere in this room.

381
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,250
但问题是 那儿没...没摄影机
But the thing is, there's no...there's no cameras.

382
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:17,000
有的话我会看得到
If there was, I would've seen an angle on the video monitors.

383
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:20,750
你进去了就有一整晚去开锁
So if we can put you inside that room, you can work on it all night.

384
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:26,470
我要知道保险柜的型号
We'll need pictures of the safe or a model number from their files.

385
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:29,890
我还要平面图...地图...
Then we're gonna need plans...infrastructure maps...

386
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:33,140
蓝图 设计图等等
blueprints, schematics, anything we can get our hands on.

387
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:35,100
再给我两天 就能拿得到
That's all I got for now, but give me two days.

388
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:37,650
还要设法进地下室
We just gotta find a way to get into that basement.

389
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:22,240
你要不计前嫌 还是一直臭着一张脸开车?
You gonna let it go, or are we gonna drive around pissed all night?

390
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,990
去吃屎吧?
Why don't you kiss my ass?

391
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:52,310
- 我们好了 你呢? - 等一下
- We're about set up. You ready? - Hold on.

392
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,910
- 能把座标给我? - 还不行 还不行
- Wanna give me a mark? - Not yet. Not yet.

393
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,510
怎么样?
How you doing?

394
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,060
等我跟你联络
Stay off the air until I call.

395
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,420
3-3 2-6...
Three-three, two-six...

396
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,880
2-9 3-2
two-nine, three-two.

397
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:03,600
我重复一下: 33 26 29 32
I repeat: 33, 26, 29, 32.

398
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:07,770
收到了 33-26-29-32
Copy that. Three-three, two-six, two-nine, three-two

399
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:15,570
右转 向东走20码
Make a right. Proceed east about 20 yards.

400
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:17,570
就是下一个缺口
You should see the next opening.

401
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,580
我面前是一堵泥墙...
I'm at a wall here, a cinder block wall...

402
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,460
你叫我去哪儿
where you told me I have to go.

403
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,790
真的吗? 应该直走才对
Are you sure about that? It shows a straight shot on here.

404
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,500
我没作梦 这就是一堵墙
It's not my imagination. I'm right here in front of it.

405
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:37,970
你自己下来看看?
You wanna come down here and see for yourself?

406
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:42,260
好吧 好的 好的 等一下
Right. Okay, okay. Hold on.

407
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,520
好的 等我一下
All right, just give me a second.

408
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:52,270
- 你听到吗? - 左转 走20英尺
- Can you read me? - Make a left. Go about 20 feet.

409
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:53,900
有一条平行甬道
You should run into a parallel tunnel.

410
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:56,440
右转就对了
Make a right. You'll be right back on course.

411
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,950
进了甬道向西走150码
Take the tunnel about 150 yards due west.

412
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:05,290
到了T字路口就告诉我
You'll reach a "T" junction. Tell me when you're there.

413
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:06,790
走三百码
About 300yards.

414
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:09,750
- 到了尽头往右转 - 往西北走
- Came to the end. Made a right. - Head Northwest.

415
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:11,590
东北 看一下 是东北方向
Northeast. Check that. Northeast.

416
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:13,130
等一下
One second. Hold on.

417
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:17,260
- 可以吗? - 我正往西走 正往西走
- Are you with me? - Going west. Going west.

418
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:22,140
- 我正往西走 我绕圈了 - 右转 往东走四十码
- I'm going west. I'm in a circle. - Make a right. Go 40 yards east.

419
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:26,140
然后左转 走大约...
Then make a left turn. Go about...

420
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:28,270
右转 回来
Make a right. Head back.

421
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:30,770
还有五百码
You got maybe 500 yards to go.

422
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:41,370
再走二十英尺就在地下室正下方
Straight ahead 20 feet, and you should be dead under the room.

423
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:43,040
甬道很长
The tunnel will keep on going.

424
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,540
但看上面 你应该能看到梯子
But look up. You should see the access ladder.

425
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:54,130
找到了 我要爬上去
I'm at a shaft. I'm gonna climb up.

426
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:08,270
你在干嘛?
What are you doing?

427
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,400
我还在爬
Still climbing.

428
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,300
看来是了
This looks like it.

429
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:08,280
我好了
I'm done.

430
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:22,170
搞什么鬼?
What the hell is this?

431
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:30,130
出口都是工程人员
Hey, you got a utility crew all over the entrance.

432
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:32,130
你要找别的出口
You're gonna have to find another way out.

433
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:08,550
你在哪里?
Where are you?

434
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,890
丹提和奥塔瓦街口
I'm at De La Montagne and Ottawa.

435
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:19,980
重复: 丹提和奥塔瓦街口
Repeat: De La Montagne and Ottawa.

436
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:21,980
好 我们正赶去
Got it. We're on our way.

437
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:30,740
应该就在那里 就这儿
This should be it, right here.

438
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:34,870
到了 我正在找你
We're here. I'm just trying to find you.

439
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:37,370
那儿 他在那儿
There. He's right over there.

440
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:01,520
好的 你安全了
Okay, you're all clear.

441
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,530
出来了
I'm coming out.

442
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:16,140
Excuse me.
不好意思

443
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:33,530
Merci. Good night.
谢谢 晚安(之前他在假装问路)

444
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:49,320
好啊
Hello.

445
00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:52,910
有人在吗?
Anybody home?

446
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:14,230
- 香槟啊 - 是啊
- Champagne. - Yeah.

447
00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:16,480
- 不错啊 - 好漂亮的礼服
- Nice touch. - Nice dress.

448
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,400
喜欢吗? 谢了
You like? Thank you.

449
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:25,410
所以 前几天你问我一个问题
So, you asked me a question a couple of days ago.

450
00:47:25,490 --> 00:47:27,950
你认真想过了?
And you gave it some serious thought?

451
00:47:28,910 --> 00:47:30,830
其实 我忘了问题是什么
Actually, I forgot the question.

452
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:35,790
这是我的回答
Here's my answer.

453
00:47:35,870 --> 00:47:37,380
你没举杯
You're not holding up your glass.

454
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:38,790
抱歉
I'm sorry.

455
00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:43,800
我爸是律师...他很聪明...
My father was a lawyer...very smart man...

456
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:47,220
他老是说一单好买卖...
and he would always say that a deal is only good...

457
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:51,140
双方都要感觉有所付出
if it leaves both parties feeling as if they gave up something.

458
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:54,390
快要回答了吗? 酒杯越来越重
Is an answer coming soon? 'Cause the glass is getting heavy.

459
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,900
好
Okay.

460
00:47:59,070 --> 00:48:01,190
我会改变生活...
I will change my life...

461
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,200
我会搬来这里...
I will move here...

462
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:06,370
我也会爱你...
I will love you...

463
00:48:08,030 --> 00:48:12,160
我也相信这是最好的决定
and believe that this is the best decision that I've made.

464
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,960
但我不希望有一天你会坐牢...
But I will not move here if it means that one day...

465
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,750
我得隔着玻璃跟你说话
I might have to talk to you through glass.

466
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:21,260
或是每晚为你担心害怕
I won't move here if it means spending my nights worrying.

467
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:26,890
要是你答应马上洗手不干...
So if you can promise me, as of right now, that you're through...

468
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:31,180
我们就干杯庆祝
then we can drink to making changes.

469
00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:42,530
我...我说干杯了
I...I said you could drink now.

470
00:48:42,570 --> 00:48:43,660
我知道
I know.

471
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:46,280
这些我都想要
I wanna do all that.

472
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:52,210
但是我必须干这最后一票...
I just have to tell you that I'm gonna do one more thing...

473
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:54,380
- 就这样 - 哦 妈的
- and that's it. - Oh, fuck.

474
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:56,920
你说的都很棒 很完美
Everything you said is great. It's perfect.

475
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,260
只是我还得干最后一票
I just have one more thing I have to do.

476
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:03,010
你明明办不到却要哄我
You put that out there when you knew you couldn't follow through.

477
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:05,930
我说出来是因为...我一直跟着
I put it out there because...I am following through.

478
00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:07,930
- 这是我的最后一票 我保证 - 才怪
- This is my last one. I promise. - Sure it is.

479
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:10,060
我向你保证
I promise you it is my last one.

480
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:12,770
那就马上退出
Then quit. Quit now.

481
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:15,940
- "最后一票"是什么意思? - 意思是你要什么就有什么
- What does "one last one" mean? - It means we don't need anything.

482
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:19,900
我从以前到现在什么都不要...
I didn't need anything before, and I don't need anything now...

483
00:49:19,950 --> 00:49:22,200
我只要跟你在一起
but what I wanted was to be with you.

484
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:25,830
我不要听这种屁话
And what I didn't need was exactly this kind of painful bullshit.

485
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:30,460
我之前的生活不算完美 但至少清清楚楚
My life wasn't perfect before, but at least we were clear.

486
00:49:33,210 --> 00:49:34,210
你要给我时间...
Give me some...

487
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:38,470
到时候再见
I'll see you when I see you.

488
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:51,840

490

- You don't need to do it. - I like a clean window, Danny.

491
00:50:58,090 --> 00:50:59,300

If you do that, I'll double your last price.

539
00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:34,640

542
00:53:43,270 --> 00:53:45,770
你肯跟这种人合作?

543
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:48,070

557
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:47,740

You're gonna need two, three hours to drill through that.

563
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:07,720
- 你不能钻穿 - 为什么?
- You can't drill this. - Why not?

564
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:11,100
新的型号有这种玻璃
'Cause this is a newer model and it's got these glass packs.

565
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:14,480
你看到了吗? 看到了吗?
See the glass pack here? See?

566
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:17,730
玻璃一被弄破钢栓就会卡死
Drill through that, the glass breaks and those bolts spring into place.

567
00:56:17,810 --> 00:56:19,570
那就完了 锁着呢 算了吧

I've never seen anything like that. What do you have in mind?

570
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:27,700
我不知道 但只要做得出来 就一定能拆掉
I don't know, but if somebody built it, somebody can unbuild it.

571
00:56:38,750 --> 00:56:41,760
对 看 我一关掉这个 灯就会灭...
Yeah, see, when I shut this down, you'll see this light go off...

572
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:44,340
但是警卫室却不会显示
but up in the booth, nothing will register.

573
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:50,310
- 这就是保险柜? - 没错

That's an active infrared post.

579
00:57:03,610 --> 00:57:05,700
我不知道 系统资料上没有
I don't know. That wasn't on the system specs.

580
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:09,200
一定是另外加装的
That's gotta be some independent loop they set up just in the cage.

581
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,120
让我来搞定
I'll take care of it.

582
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:15,430

00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:26,640
出了点状况 我送你走
I gotta take care of something. I'll drop you off.

585
00:57:51,790 --> 00:57:54,000
我老妈只出去半小时
My mom's only out for about a half an hour.

586
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:02,720
我侵入保全公司的伺服器...
I was cruising around Ironclad's server at the root COBOL level...

587
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:07,720
正要下手就有人侵入我的电脑
when someone counter-cracked me, hacked into my machines, my data.

588
00:58:07,810 --> 00:58:09,640
我有三分钟是完全曝光的
For three minutes, I was fully exposed.

589
00:58:09,730 --> 00:58:14,060
现在我得重新建立防火墙
Now I have to fire wall my whole operations all from scratch.

590
00:58:14,150 --> 00:58:17,690
- 你能用英语跟我说吗? - 抱歉
- Can you tell me that in English? - Sorry.

591
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:20,650
我就快找到密码了...
I was a few keystrokes away from pulling those engineering codes...

592
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:22,860
突然发现另一端有人
when I bump into a guy on the other end.

593
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:25,780
- 另一端有什么人? - 保全公司的人
- And what's on the other end? - Ironclad's computers.

594
00:58:25,830 --> 00:58:28,000
我猜是低阶系统工程师
My guess is he's some low-level systems administrator.

595
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:33,210
他在私人聊天室寄这个给我
So, we switch to a private chat room, and he sends me this.

596
00:58:33,245 --> 00:58:34,740
"天下没白吃的午餐 混蛋"

597
00:58:35,130 --> 00:58:36,050
你能相信吗?
Can you believe that?

598
00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:39,300
这家伙闯进我的电脑骂我混蛋
The guy comes into my world and calls me an asshole.

599
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:42,430

- Can you get me the bypass codes? - I type, " How much?" He types...

600
00:58:42,510 --> 00:58:44,300
"海关大楼地下室通行密码?"
" Engineering codes for the customshouse basement?"

601
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:46,470
我说 "对 你猜对了"
I say, "You guessed it, Blue's Clues."

602
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:48,600
他却说"去你的" 我回骂他"不 去你的"
And he says, " Fuck you." And I say, " No, fuck you."

603
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:51,350
他又回骂我 我叫他去死
And he says, " No, fuck you." I'm like, " No, fuck you."

604
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,360
他回骂我三字经
Then he's like, " No, fuck..."

605
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,940
你弄得到密码吗?
Can you get me the bypass codes?

606

他要五万块钱
The guy wants 50 thou in exchange for the codes.

00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,250
我把钱汇去 他把密码给你
I'll wire the money, and he'll deliver the codes through you.

610
00:59:10,330 --> 00:59:11,830
不行 那人不要转帐
Negative. The guy won't go for a transfer.

611
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,340
他要我们亲手交钱
He wants cash and he wants to do it in person.

612
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:17,380
- 还有吗? - 没了
- Anything else? - No.

613
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:20,430
你去安排 不 不 别送我 我自己出去
You set it up. No, no, stay. I'll let myself out.

614
00:59:20,510 --> 00:59:23,560
密码拿到手我就要大开杀戒
When this score's done, I'm gonna brute this creep with everything.

615
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:27,270
这家伙会被我整得惨兮兮
By the time I'm done with this fuck, he won't be able to hide in Bolivia!

616
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:59,050
天啊 人好多
Jesus. Look at all these people.

617
00:59:59,090 --> 01:00:02,010
谁会约在公园交钱?
Who sets up a meeting in a public park?

618
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:08,900
- 看到他吗? - 还在找

Cousin? Okay. See the guy over my left shoulder...

626
01:00:57,990 --> 01:01:03,200
后面长椅上 在看报纸的 那个大块头?
back there on the bench, reading the paper, the big one?

627
01:01:03,290 --> 01:01:06,830
他是我表兄弟 知道吧?
That's my cousin, okay?

Hey, man, don't give me orders. I get orders all day, okay?

632
01:01:24,690 --> 01:01:26,810
你不能公然数钱
Can't count the money in a public place.

633
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:29,150
所以你最好别约在公园里交易
That's why you don't set a meeting in a park.

634
01:01:29,230 --> 01:01:31,070
下次注意
Just for future reference.

He's gonna give me the numbers, and I'm gonna read 'em into this mike...

639
01:01:42,370 --> 01:01:44,370

to a friend of mine who's gonna check 'em out.

640
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:50,170
难道你要我抄在面纸上?
Did you think I was gonna write it down on a cocktail napkin?

You tell the hack at the other end of that wire...

649
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:41,520

he tries to get in my system again, I will fry him, okay?

650

665
01:03:47,170 --> 01:03:49,010
闭嘴 艾瑞
Shut up, Eric.

666
01:03:49,090 --> 01:03:52,260
他们要在服务器上确认密码 得花点时间
They have to verify the numbers off the server. It takes some time.

667
01:03:52,350 --> 01:03:53,850
放轻松 艾瑞
Just relax, Eric.

668
01:03:57,390 --> 01:03:59,310
能帮我吗? 这里的人很不专业
Can you help me out? It's turning into amateur hour out here.

669
01:03:59,350 --> 01:04:02,060
- 去你的 混蛋 - 你在干嘛?
- Fuck you, asshole. - What are you doing?

670
01:04:02,150 --> 01:04:03,650
他们有枪
One of them has a gun.

671
01:04:03,730 --> 01:04:05,820
伯特 大个子有枪
Burt, big guy's got a gun.

672
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:07,650
史蒂芬 怎么样? 快一点 对方抓狂了
Steven, how's it going? We're losing these guys.

673
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:10,660
- 我正在查 老兄 - 史蒂芬 吃饭吗?
- I'm working it, man. - Steven, want some lunch?

674
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:13,080
我在讲电话 母猪!
I'm on the phone, bitch!

675
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:14,330
- 没事吧? - 没事

676
01:04:14,410 --> 01:04:19,250
大家别动 艾瑞 你看我的手
Don't anybody move. Eric, look at my hand right now.

677
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:24,920
你一拔枪我就会开枪 到时候就一团糟
If you take that out, I'm gonna take this out, be a big fucking mess.

678
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:27,510
把枪放下 艾瑞
Put it away, Eric.

679
01:04:27,550 --> 01:04:29,680
你没看到有小孩啊 你在想什么?
There's kids all around. What are you thinking?

680
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:34,640
放回去 深呼吸然后把枪放回去
Put it away. Take a deep breath and just put it in your back pocket.

681
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:36,940
放回去
Put it away.

682
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:43,110
- 没问题了 - 最后一组密码确认
- They're all good. - Last set of numbers confirmed.

683
01:04:43,190 --> 01:04:45,190
最后一组密码确认 快走吧
Last set of numbers confirmed. Let's get out of here.

684
01:04:55,790 --> 01:04:57,250
下次别带枪来
Next time, don't bring a gun.

685
01:04:57,290 --> 01:05:01,000
听着 我觉得也许有必要 结果也有用
Listen, I thought I might need one, and I did.

686
01:05:01,090 --> 01:05:03,210
- 现在我们有密码了 - 别带枪
- Now we've got the codes. - Don't bring a gun.

687
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:10,260
Jesus!
老天爷!

688
01:05:12,310 --> 01:05:15,520
我打去 他们说你还没住进去 没
I called. They said you hadn't checked in yet. No.

689
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:22,990
你几点会到?
So what time you getting in?

690
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:27,660
别这样 亲爱的 别住在旅馆
Come on, honey. Don't stay at a hotel.

691

你来我家 我煮饭

我们再谈谈 好吗?
You know, we'll talk, okay?

695
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:55,270
#I'm thinking 'bout a place#

696
01:05:55,350 --> 01:05:58,020
#I'm waiting for the day#

697
01:05:58,110 --> 01:06:02,530
#When I will make my getaway#

698
01:06:03,650 --> 01:06:06,780
#Because as any fool can see#

699
01:06:06,870 --> 01:06:09,330
#there's nothing here for me#

700
01:06:09,410 --> 01:06:13,120
#But hurry up, boy, bring that water#

701
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:15,630
#Don't do things you shouldn't oughta#

702
01:06:15,710 --> 01:06:17,590

He's good.

703
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:22,220

704
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:26,350
再过两个小时 没问题 我很好
I'll go in in a couple hours. I'm okay. I'm doing fine.

705
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:30,560
听着 告诉我 告诉我
Listen, tell me something. Tell me something.

706
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:32,850
你干了这么久...
All the years you've been doing this...

707
01:06:32,890 --> 01:06:35,270
下过最大的赌注是什么?
what's the biggest gamble you ever took?

708
01:06:35,350 --> 01:06:39,030
干这行的 你知道 最大的一笔
On the job. You know, biggest long shot.

709
01:06:39,110 --> 01:06:41,320
我从不冒险
I don't take long shots.

710
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,910
我知道你很小心 你知道 我也是
I know you're careful. You know, I'm careful too.

711
01:06:43,990 --> 01:06:46,580
我不是那个意思 我是说...
That's not what I mean. I mean...

712
01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:49,200
你刚入行时 当你刚要做的时候...
When you were starting out, when you were just getting going...

713
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:52,120
你肯定得冒点险
you must have taken some fliers here and there.

714
01:06:52,210 --> 01:06:54,290
做过疯狂的事 我只是好奇
Done something that was a little wild. I'm just curious.

从不冒过险
Never took long shots.

716
01:07:00,050 --> 01:07:01,630
我奉劝你一件事
I'm gonna say something to you.

717
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:03,800
你很聪明 也很有才华...
You're smart, you're talented and you know a few things...

718
01:07:03,890 --> 01:07:07,060
但若你只会挺而走险 有才华也没用
but talent means nothing if you don't make the right choices.

719
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:10,560
很多高手都没有好下场
There's talented people out there who never see daylight anymore.

720
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:12,850
你想干这一行就要能够自律...
Last thing, it takes discipline...

721
01:07:12,940 --> 01:07:14,900
因为这整个游戏是个长期的...
because this whole game is one big long shot...

722
01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:17,230
如果你想一步登天....
and if you don't have the discipline to stay away from the fliers...

723
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:20,280
或赌运气 你只要走错一步路...
or from the gambles or whatever else you wanna call a stupid move...

724
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:23,620
那朋友 我告诉你 你的下场会很惨
then, my friend, I'm afraid to say, one day you will go down.

725
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:25,200
一定的
It's inevitable.

726
01:07:25,990 --> 01:07:28,290
你要我的建议?
You want my advice?

727

把你要的东西列出来...
Make a list of everything you want now...

728
01:07:31,410 --> 01:07:34,630
计划如何在25年内得到它们
and plan on spending the next 25 years of your life getting it.

729
01:07:34,710 --> 01:07:37,590
慢慢地 一点一滴地累积
Slowly, piece by piece.

730
01:07:45,010 --> 01:07:46,510
我了解你的意思
I see what you're saying.

731
01:07:48,020 --> 01:07:52,480
不过我看你已经拥有这些...
But still, I'm looking at you, and you got all this already...

732
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:55,150
而你跟我坐在这里 跟一个与你...
and you're sitting here with me, working with a partner...

733
01:07:55,230 --> 01:07:58,280
住在一个城市的人合作 一起做一个...
in the city where you live, on a job that's gotten more complicated...

734
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:00,820
比你想像的更复杂的事情
than you thought it was gonna be.

735
01:08:00,860 --> 01:08:03,370
一定有什么值得你冒险
So I know you're still taking a shot at something.

736
01:08:09,290 --> 01:08:11,500
我得走了
I gotta go.

737
01:08:13,290 --> 01:08:15,500
明天见
See ya tomorrow.

738
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:24,720

As soon as the guards leave, you gotta tell me right away.

741

- You can't be late. - I'm not worried about my end.

742
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:36,530
你半小时内怎么打开保险柜?
I'm wondering how you're gonna break that safe in half an hour.

743
01:08:36,610 --> 01:08:38,360
你知道 我是说...
You know, I mean...

744
01:08:57,260 --> 01:09:00,640
- 这有可能吗? - 很简单的物理原则

Then if you're on the box by 5:00, the prize goes in the bag by 5: 15.

749
01:09:19,450 --> 01:09:22,740
- 没问题 - 五点十五 五点半 我出来后
- You got no problem at all. - 5: 15, 5:30, I'm back in the hole.

750

- 你就重设系统 - 太完美了
- You reset the system. - That's perfect.

751

我们拿了钱就永不见面
He pays us off. We never see each other again.

他们在说 听说麦斯欠了苏老大一笔钱...
People are talking. They say Max is in trouble with Teddy Salida...

767
01:10:33,820 --> 01:10:36,780
他要干一大票还债来摆脱他
and he's pulling off a big job to get rid of him.

768
01:10:38,620 --> 01:10:40,540
他们这么说吗?
That's what they say?

769
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:44,790
也许你应该退出
Maybe you should walk away from this one.

770
01:11:41,370 --> 01:11:42,700
麦斯?
Max?

你跑来干嘛?
What the hell are you doing down here?

782
01:12:42,330 --> 01:12:44,710
他们把它和百慕大的房子给我了?
They gave it to me and the house in Bermuda?

783
01:12:44,790 --> 01:12:47,090
你是怎么了?
What's the matter with you?

784
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:50,260
他知道多少?
What's he know?

785
01:12:50,340 --> 01:12:53,390
- 知道什么? - 我们这一票
- About what? - About what we're doing.

786
01:12:54,430 --> 01:12:57,720
没什么 我只说有一票值八百万...
Nothing. I told him I found something that would go for eight...

787
01:12:57,770 --> 01:13:00,980
我要和他平分 就这样
and that we'd split the profits, that's all.

788
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:04,400
那根宝杖你要卖多少钱 麦斯?

01:13:10,570 --> 01:13:14,160
天啊 麦斯 你在想什么?
Jesus. Max, what were you thinking?

791
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:16,160
你在想什么? 我跟你想的一样
What was I thinking? The same thing you were thinking.

792
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:21,420
要不然我们该怎么退隐江湖?
How are we gonna get out from under all this bullshit we've been living?

793
01:13:21,460 --> 01:13:24,590
机会来了 就得把握
The chance came. Took it.

794

01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:30,340
- 你这是什么意思 不是吗? - 不是 事情一团糟
- What do you mean, it's not? - It's not. It's a mess.

796
01:13:30,430 --> 01:13:33,930
- 不会成功的 - 等一下 他妈的等等
- It's not gonna work. - Wait. Wait a fucking minute.

797
01:13:34,010 --> 01:13:38,190
这一票是很单纯的任务 尼克 你在担心什么?
This is absolutely clean, Nick. What are you worried about?

798
01:13:38,270 --> 01:13:41,190
老天 冒险的人是我 不是你
Jesus Christ, it's my ass on the line anyway, not yours.

799
01:13:41,270 --> 01:13:43,360
我不想拼了老命...
I'm not taking the biggest gamble of my life...

800
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:45,440
把钱给苏老大
so I can hand my money over to Teddy Salida.

801
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:48,700
你以为你拿不到钱?
You think you're not gonna get your fucking money?

802
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:50,530
听着 你要知道两件事
Look, there's two things you gotta know.

803
01:13:50,620 --> 01:13:53,790
第一 你会拿到每一分钱
One is you're gonna get every fucking red cent.

804
01:13:53,830 --> 01:13:57,120
第二 对 苏老大知道一点
And, yeah, Teddy knows a little.

805
01:13:57,160 --> 01:13:59,290
- 他知道了? - 他只知道一点
- He knows? - He does a little, I said.

806
01:13:59,370 --> 01:14:03,130
- 所以你确实说了谎? - 对 我是说了谎! 没办法 天!
- So you did lie? - Yeah, lied! Shit happens, man!

807
01:14:03,170 --> 01:14:05,090
我的天!
Christ Almighty!

808
01:14:05,170 --> 01:14:07,170
我是为了你和我才说谎的
I lied for you and I lied for me.

809
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:10,760
我为了说服你总得撒点谎 向来如此
I had to say something to get you to suit up, like always.

810
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:17,350
很抱歉 我不干了
I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna do it.

811
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:22,650
你只要开了保险柜门拿了货
It's a tiny door. Open the door. Take the shit.

812
01:14:22,730 --> 01:14:24,690
关了门就万事妥当
Close the door. We're out.

813
01:14:24,740 --> 01:14:27,320
事情变得太复杂
There's too much bullshit around it.

814
01:14:44,260 --> 01:14:46,050
那是什么?
What's that?

815
01:14:58,230 --> 01:15:00,070
买主
The buyer.

816
01:15:01,690 --> 01:15:04,570
很简单 你带了货去找他
Real simple. You call him when you get the scepter.

817
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:08,200
你们在圣罗伦河三哩外碰头
He'll meet you at the airstrip 30 miles up the St. Lawrence.

818
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:12,040
附近有一座小镇叫圣奎亚
There's a little town called St. Croix.

819
01:15:13,580 --> 01:15:16,250
你们一手交钱一手交货
You give him the scepter, he gives you the cash.

820
01:15:16,330 --> 01:15:19,750
你拿了你那份 就把钱汇给我
You take your cut and you wire me the rest.

821
01:15:19,790 --> 01:15:23,380
我把钱还给苏老大就没事了
I'll give Teddy his, and you're clean.

822
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:30,310
这太冒险了
It's too risky.

823
01:15:30,390 --> 01:15:32,350
办不到
Can't.

824
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:38,400
你不知道你在做什么
You don't know what you're doing.

825
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:41,190
你知道我们认识多少年?
You know how long we go back?

826
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:44,780
25年了
Twenty-five years.

827
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:50,240
我告诉你
I'm gonna tell you something.

828
01:15:50,330 --> 01:15:54,460
我这辈子第一次感到害怕
For the first time in my life, I'm scared.

829
01:15:54,540 --> 01:15:57,000
我不知道为什么 但我以前天不怕地不怕...
I don't know why it is. I was never scared before...

830
01:15:57,090 --> 01:15:59,880
但这次我好怕 尼克
but I'm scared now, Nick.

831
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:04,090
没错 苏老大会把我干掉
And you're right about Teddy. He's gonna blow me away if he can.

832
01:16:04,180 --> 01:16:06,260
如果我不还钱的话...
If I don't get him his money, he...

833
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:09,680
天 他...
Man, he...

834
01:16:12,270 --> 01:16:16,810
嘿 别...别...别...别这次别弃我不顾
Hey, don't...don't...don't...don't let me slide on this one.

835
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:19,230
我会赔上一条命的 兄弟
I can't afford it, man.

836
01:16:24,990 --> 01:16:28,660
我...无路可逃了
I can't...I can't scrap it out anymore.

837
01:16:28,740 --> 01:16:31,160
我需要这笔钱
I gotta have some slack.

838
01:16:36,380 --> 01:16:38,380
好的 好吧
All right. Okay.

839
01:16:40,670 --> 01:16:42,800
你最好别害我
I hope you're not fucking me up.

840
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:01,320
我要去检查电源
I'm going down to check the power.

841
01:17:08,870 --> 01:17:12,670
- 你有多少工具? - 拿去
- How much more equipment you got? - Here you go.

842
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:19,170
- 对不起! 对不起! 对不起! - 没关系 布莱恩
- Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! - It's okay, Brian.

843
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:21,510
- 进来 - 我的收音机
- Come on in. - It's my radio.

844
01:17:21,590 --> 01:17:23,760
- 嘿 这是怎么回事? - 别担心 丹尼
- Hey, what's all the commotion? - Don't worry, Danny.

845
01:17:23,850 --> 01:17:25,970
- 地下室要加强防备 - 为什么?
- They're beefing things up. - What for?

846
01:17:26,060 --> 01:17:28,680
- 只是多装几架摄影机 - 好像它会被偷似的 是吗?
- A few cameras in the basement. - Like we're gonna lose it, right?

847
01:17:28,730 --> 01:17:31,140
- 什么被偷? - 那个在钢琴腿里的东西
- Lose what? - That thing in the piano leg.

848
01:17:31,230 --> 01:17:35,150
- 那根金棍? - 一些法国国宝
- The big gold thing? - Some French national treasure.

849
01:17:35,230 --> 01:17:39,320
- 那是一根宝杖 - 一些专家看了那些照片
- It's called a scepter. - Some expert saw those pictures.

850
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:42,910
办公室中心打来电话了
Now we're getting calls from the central office.

851
01:17:46,370 --> 01:17:49,710
嘿 是我 对 出了状况
Hey, it's me. Yeah, we got a problem.

852
01:17:49,750 --> 01:17:53,630
进口那里也有个摄影机 拍着这里
They got a camera over the main door here, covering that.

853
01:17:53,710 --> 01:17:56,880
他们在这儿装了摄影机 中间这儿也有摄影机
They got a camera here, looking right across the middle.

854
01:17:56,920 --> 01:18:00,010
保险柜正前方也有一台...

监视整个铁笼
sees this entire cage.

856
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:05,890
这台摄影机面对着它...
This camera looking at the box...

857
01:18:05,930 --> 01:18:08,690
它离地多高 离天花板多远?
how high is it from the floor and how low is it from the ceiling?

858
01:18:08,770 --> 01:18:12,400
大概离地10至12英尺
Probably 10, 12 feet up off the floor.

859
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:15,940
离天花板四英尺 我们完蛋了
Four feet down from the ceiling. I think we're fucked.

860
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:20,950
所以让我...
So let me...

861
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:23,370
我到了这儿
When I'm here...

862
01:18:23,450 --> 01:18:26,410
你就切断摄影机 然后再恢复影像
you'll cut the feed when I get across here, then you'll restore it.

863
01:18:26,450 --> 01:18:28,540
等我准备好了 你再切断摄影机
Then when I'm ready here, you'll cut it again...

864
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:30,920
让我干活
and I'll go to work here.

865
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,880
我不晓得
I don't know about that, man.

866
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:36,260
他们会尽快把宝杖移走
They know what it is so now they're gonna move it as soon as they can.

867
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:40,890
这是唯一的机会 现在不干就不要干
We're not gonna get another chance. We gotta go now or we don't go at all.

01:36:07,730 --> 01:36:09,980
我好了 快切断讯号
I'm all set. Cut the cameras.

926
01:36:13,310 --> 01:36:15,440
我要行动了 我要行动了
Gotta go. Got to go.

927
01:36:18,740 --> 01:36:20,820
怎么了? 怎么了?
What's up? What's up?

928
01:36:22,030 --> 01:36:24,830
有人来了 有人来了
I got company. I got company.

929
01:36:26,790 --> 01:36:28,790
等一下
Hang on one second.

930
01:36:28,870 --> 01:36:30,620
撑着点 我就回来
Just sit tight. I'll be right back.

931
01:37:02,740 --> 01:37:04,580
好
Okay.

932
01:37:21,470 --> 01:37:23,470
杰克 你在哪里?
Jack, where are you?

933
01:37:27,940 --> 01:37:30,400
杰克 进来 杰克
Jack, come in. Jack.

934
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:48,580
杰克 你在吗?
Jack, are you there?

935
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:11,530
我要撤退 重复: 我要撤退
I'm pulling out. Repeat: I'm pulling out.

936
01:38:11,570 --> 01:38:13,530
- 我回来了 我回来了 - 太迟了
- I'm back. I'm back. - It's too late.

937
01:38:13,570 --> 01:38:15,860
- 我要撤退 - 不 没问题 可以了
- I'm pulling out. - No, it's not. We're good.

938
01:38:15,950 --> 01:38:17,620
准备好走了
Get ready to go.

939
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:20,740
听我指令
On my mark.

940
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:26,080
快去 快去 快去
Go, go, go.

941
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:42,520
监视器是怎么了?
What the hell's wrong with these machines?

942
01:38:55,160 --> 01:38:58,160
别敲了 检查一下接头
Hey, stop banging on it. Check the connection.

943
01:39:19,470 --> 01:39:22,810
- 有什么问题? - 不晓得
- You see something? - I don't know.

944
01:39:41,660 --> 01:39:44,080
给他们打电话 打给保全公司
Call them. Call Ironclad.

945
01:39:44,830 --> 01:39:47,920
- 这样不是很丢脸? - 我不管 快打
- And look like idiots? - I don't care. Call them.

946
01:40:43,520 --> 01:40:46,230
也许是地下室的器材故障
Maybe it's some of the equipment down in the basement.

947
01:40:48,570 --> 01:40:50,570
好 谢了
Okay. Thanks.

948
01:40:52,280 --> 01:40:54,910
他们过几分钟就到
Someone will be here in a few minutes.

949
01:41:41,380 --> 01:41:43,460
你在哪儿 孩子?
Where are you, kid?

950
01:43:29,700 --> 01:43:32,710
你敢乱动或吭声就没命
Make a move, make a sound, and you are dead.

951
01:43:32,790 --> 01:43:34,830
你不明白吗?
Do you understand me?

952
01:43:36,750 --> 01:43:38,340
转过来
Turn around.

953
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:44,430
别说话
Be quiet.

954
01:43:58,860 --> 01:44:00,820
我希望你没下来过 兄弟
I wish you had not come down here, man.

955
01:44:04,660 --> 01:44:08,790
过去 转过去 快点 转过去
Get over there. Turn around. Come on. Let's go. Turn around.

你是个好人 我不想伤你
You're a good man. I don't want to hurt you.

961
01:44:23,430 --> 01:44:26,350
你若乱来或者想开门 我就毙了你
But if you start making noise or try to open that door, I will do it.

962
01:44:26,430 --> 01:44:27,930
懂吗?
Do you understand me?

963
01:44:30,310 --> 01:44:33,400
乖乖待着 不会有事的
Stay in there and be quiet. Everything will be fine.

964
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:38,630
我不想等了
I don't wanna wait.

965
01:45:38,670 --> 01:45:41,470
你跟汤米马上到地下室去
I want you and Tommy to go into the basement now.

966
01:45:41,510 --> 01:45:43,810

罗伦 快去
Laurent, please.

968
01:45:47,680 --> 01:45:50,980
汤米 去找菲利 我们要再查一下地下室
Tommy, get Philippe. We're gonna be checking out the basement again.

969
01:46:35,490 --> 01:46:37,320
给我站住!
Hold it right there!

970
01:46:37,400 --> 01:46:39,620
- 你疯了? - 把东西放下来
- Are you crazy? - Take it off and put it down.

971
01:46:39,700 --> 01:46:43,660
- 少来 - 给我把东西放下来!
- Aw, come on. - Take it off and put it down now!

972
01:46:43,750 --> 01:46:47,120
- 别这样 - 给我把东西放在地上
- Don't do this. - Take it off and put it down!

973
01:46:47,210 --> 01:46:49,170
- 拜托 别... - 别来这套
- Please, don't... - Don't fucking argue with me.

974
01:46:49,250 --> 01:46:51,920
把东西放下来
Take it off and put it down.

975
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:53,630
我办不到 办不到
I can't. I can't.

976
01:46:54,920 --> 01:46:58,090
我会射穿你膝盖 别浪费时间
I'll put the next one in your knee. I don't have time to fuck around.

977
01:46:58,180 --> 01:47:01,470
有事以后再说 我要带走宝杖
We can work out the details later. I am leaving with that scepter.

978
01:47:02,770 --> 01:47:06,850
把东西交给我 快点!
Now, take it off and hand it over right now!

979
01:47:14,070 --> 01:47:17,660
放下 慢慢地
Put it down. Slowly.

980
01:47:18,370 --> 01:47:20,660
退后 退后一步
Now, step back. Back up.

981
01:47:29,590 --> 01:47:31,550
- 把面罩脱掉 - 什么?
- Take off your mask. - What?

982
01:47:31,630 --> 01:47:33,130
快脱掉!
Take it off!

983
01:47:34,760 --> 01:47:38,100
我没时间玩了 快脱掉
I don't have time to play games. Take it off.

984
01:47:50,440 --> 01:47:52,360
丢过去
Throw it over there.

985
01:47:54,530 --> 01:47:56,700
站到中间
Step in the middle.

986
01:47:56,780 --> 01:47:59,120
站过去 这就对了
Step in the middle. That's right.

987
01:48:02,790 --> 01:48:06,830
如果一开始你对我尊重一点就不会这样
We wouldn't be here if you'd thrown me some respect at the beginning.

988
01:48:06,920 --> 01:48:08,880
- 只是有点儿 - 你这么做很蠢
- Just a little bit. - This is a stupid move.

989
01:48:10,590 --> 01:48:13,050
你在干什么? 只要上去并完成...
What are you doing? Just go up there and finish...

990
01:48:13,130 --> 01:48:14,680
这是个大计划 我得小心点
It's a long shot. I should play it tight.

991
01:48:14,760 --> 01:48:16,680
你知道我怎么想你的那个狗屁建议的吗?
You know what I think of your bullshit advice?

992
01:48:16,760 --> 01:48:19,890
我觉得你想说服我拿一个骗子的好处...
I think that's you trying to talk me into taking a sucker's share...

993
01:48:19,970 --> 01:48:23,230
而这笔买卖从一开始就是我策划的!
on a score that I set up from the beginning!

994
01:48:24,730 --> 01:48:28,780
你以为我笨得看不出来你和麦斯做的事吗?
You think I'm stupid, that I don't see what you and Max are doing?

995
01:48:30,440 --> 01:48:34,110
我是说 麦斯分你五、六百万吗?
I mean, what is he giving you? Five, six million?

996
01:48:34,200 --> 01:48:36,620
别说是真的
Tell me that's not true.

997
01:48:36,700 --> 01:48:38,910
我才没那么傻
See, that doesn't work for me.

998
01:48:40,540 --> 01:48:45,380
谢谢你的帮忙 但你应该把我当搭档
I appreciate your help, but you should've made me a partner.

999
01:48:45,460 --> 01:48:47,500
现在我要冒这个险
Now I gotta take a shot.

1000
01:48:53,220 --> 01:48:56,720
别紧张 不会有事的
Just sit tight. Just sit tight. Everything will be fine.

1001
01:49:00,730 --> 01:49:04,310
你有两个选择 冲向甬道...
Now you got a choice. You can either head for that tunnel...

1002
01:49:04,400 --> 01:49:06,270
或是对镜头微笑
or smile for that camera.

1003
01:49:14,870 --> 01:49:16,410
安卓 怎么回事?
Andre, what's happening?

1004

1019
01:51:45,650 --> 01:51:49,120
- 到外面等! - 好 再见
- Just wait outside! - Okay, bye-bye.

1021

1022
01:51:58,960 --> 01:52:01,710

- Have you seen Brian? - He's okay! He's outside!

1024

不! 天啊 就是他干的!
No! My God, it's him!

1025
01:52:09,970 --> 01:52:12,730
现在没事了 没事了
It's okay now. It's okay.

1026
01:54:44,600 --> 01:54:48,430
请注意 去纽约州奥尔巴尼的巴士将在五分钟...
Attention. The bus to Albany, New York leaves in five...

1027
01:54:50,440 --> 01:54:51,440

Come on. I'm just checking to make sure you got out okay.

1030
01:54:57,190 --> 01:54:59,150
我知道你溜了
I knew you'd give 'em the slip.

1031
01:55:00,360 --> 01:55:02,320
我也快脱身了
I'm almost home, too, here, by the way.

1032
01:55:02,410 --> 01:55:04,200
哦 是吗?你确定?
Oh, you are, huh? You sure about that?

1033
01:55:04,290 --> 01:55:07,750
不管你有多不爽 算了吧 好吗?
Look, whatever you're thinking about, just forget it, okay?

1034
01:55:07,830 --> 01:55:09,830
一切都完了 愿赌就得服输
This is over now and you just gotta deal with it.

1035
01:55:09,870 --> 01:55:13,420
还没完 你不知道自己会有什么下场 而我知道
It's not over yet 'cause you don't know where you're going, and I do.

1036
01:55:13,500 --> 01:55:15,420
- 你知道个屁! - 你知道你会怎么样吗?
- You don't know shit! - You know where you're going?

1037
01:55:15,510 --> 01:55:20,090
我马上就要走了 我会逃得远远的谁也找不到
I'm five minutes from being gone. You can't imagine where I'm going.

1038
01:55:20,180 --> 01:55:22,930
- 你不必逃 你什么都没有 - 你知道我赢了
- You got nothing. - You know what I got.

1039
01:55:23,010 --> 01:55:25,140
你只是不承认我打败你了
You just can't deal with the fact that I beat you.

1040
01:55:25,220 --> 01:55:29,310
哦 是吗?你到底有什么? 啊? 你到底有什么?
Oh, yeah? What have you got? Huh? What have you got?

1041
01:55:29,400 --> 01:55:31,440
你明明知道
You know what I've got.

1042
01:56:00,430 --> 01:56:01,680
我问你
Let me ask you something.

1043
01:56:01,760 --> 01:56:05,180
你什么时候开始觉得你比我强 嗯?
When did you start thinking you were better than me, huh?

1044
01:56:05,270 --> 01:56:06,440
高手 你还在吗?
You still there, ace?

1045
01:56:08,190 --> 01:56:11,190
好的 做的不错
Okay. Nicely done.

1046
01:56:11,270 --> 01:56:13,900
好家伙 算你狠 我们谈谈吧
Nicely done. Now let's talk about this.

1047
01:56:13,990 --> 01:56:16,360
好吧 我们看看 你不是说"愿赌就得服输"
Okay, let's see. How'd you put it? '' Deal with it. It's over.''

1048
01:56:16,450 --> 01:56:19,570
不 我觉得不对 你想让我去检举你吗?
No, I don't think so. You want me to list the ways I can burn you?

1049
01:56:19,620 --> 01:56:22,790
你不分我钱我就把你拖下水
We either work this out right now, or I will take you down.

1050
01:56:22,870 --> 01:56:26,290
哦 是吗? 怎么拖? 我的设备全都搬走了
Oh, yeah? How? My shop, my tools, they're gone.

1051
01:56:26,370 --> 01:56:29,130
我只是奉公守法的爵士吧老板
Me, my friend, I'm just a taxpaying jazz club owner.

1052
01:56:29,210 --> 01:56:32,210
而你? 你却是受到通缉的大盗
You? Every cop in the city's looking for you right about now.

1053
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:36,260
所以我要是你 就赶紧逃命吧
So if I were you, I'd quit making threats and hit the road.

1054
01:56:40,220 --> 01:56:42,270
很高兴跟你合作 高手
