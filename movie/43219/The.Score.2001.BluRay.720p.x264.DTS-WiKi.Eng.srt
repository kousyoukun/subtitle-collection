1
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,330
Wait.

2
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,270
What?

3
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,030
This.

4
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:56,560
Later.

5
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,140
I wanna smoke.

6
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,780
I wanna smoke.

7
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,440
Fine. Smoke.

8
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,860
Smoke all night.

9
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,120
Be still. Do not turn around.

10
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,990
Do not turn around.

11
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,990
You will not be hurt.

12
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,090
- Bonjour,Nick. - Bonjour,madame.

13
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:39,690
Albert.

14
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,770
Boss,hi.

15
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,780
- Jean-Claude. - So,the trip was good?

16
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,370
- So,how are we doing? - Great.

17
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,880
We have many reservations for tonight.

18
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:55,980
Good. How many covers did we have last night?

19
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,990
- Over 150. - Good.

20
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,890
- Bar was steady. - How was the music?

21
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,550
- Great band. - Good. Good.

22
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,960
Scotch on the rocks,please,little water.

23
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,970
Yeah,sure.

24
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,650
Monsieur Max.

25
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,350
Where... Where Nicky?

26
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:38,360
Voila. Back from Bermuda.

27
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:39,890
Did you have a good trip?

28
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,800
Well,not as interesting as yours,I'm sure.

29
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:47,430
My God! Let me get a look at you.

30
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,030
You look like shit. What's your secret?

31
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,110
Jean-Claude,set up number two for us.

32
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,730
Yeah,sure.

33
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,150
Just give us a little room. Thank you.

34
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,380
For sure.

35
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,390
There we are.

36
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:17,870
Bermuda.

37
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,100
Oh,God.

38
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,610
Well.

39
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,370
- It was pretty tight out there. - Good. It'll keep you sharp.

40
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:35,550
I got a minor development.

41
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:38,450
- We lost the buyer. - What do you mean,"lost"?

42
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:42,250
Well,she's in a brass casket six feet underground...

43
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,490
never to be heard from again.

44
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,490
Well,I fronted 20,000 in expenses.

45
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,260
Now I'm due that,plus 250 for my end.

46
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,320
You don't think I'm not gonna take care of you?

47
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,390
I'm not gonna cover your expenses and all that?

48
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:58,070
It's not about covering my expenses. It's the money. Find another buyer.

49
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,610
Of course. But Jesus Christ,shit happens.

50
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,770
This thing's gonna drag out. You've got to be patient.

51
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:06,810
Wait a minute. How about this?

52
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,940
Four big ones in your hand.

53
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,320
Four million dollars in your mitt.

54
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:15,680
- Four million? - More than you ever dreamed of.

55
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,660
More than we ever,ever did together.

56
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,860
Four million. What are you into?

57
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:24,160
Well,I spotted this item which was really exceptional.

58
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:28,140
It was European antiquity,elegant...

59
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,970
and it was in the hands of this real dumb prick...

60
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,670
that didn't know what he had.

61
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,770
And unfortunately...

62
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:38,210
it's become detained in transit a little.

63
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,810
You don't wanna know where?

64
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,620
It depends.

65
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,190
Depends on what?

66
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,280
- On what you're gonna tell me. - Okay.

67
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,690
It's in the Montreal Customshouse.

68
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,900
- No way. I'm sorry. - Oh,yeah. Wait a minute.

69
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:02,960
I got a guy... I got a guy inside.

70
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,480
He gives you the whole layout,handles security,everything...

71
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:12,500
You used to tell me,"Steal outside the country,in the States,Europe.

72
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,070
But Montreal,live in Montreal."

73
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:16,810
I said a lot of dumb things in my day,didn't I?

74
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:18,180
- But that's... - Right.

75
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:24,020
Let's just find another buyer for this. I gotta open the place.

76
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,890
Okay,but I'm not finished talking about this.

77
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:32,730
- Come on. - You're making a large error here.

78
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,010
Not bad.

79
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,690
- Yeah? - I just landed.

80
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,720
I got the delivery.

81
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,220
Got the bag?

82
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,080
- Yeah. Right here. - Where's Johnny?

83
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:26,490
He got it in Istanbul,right through the neck.

84
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,790
- Jesus. He was a good kid. - Yeah.

85
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,590
Good and dead.

86
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,630
So you wanna talk,or you wanna see what I got?

87
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,160
How can I be sure you're okay?

88
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,120
I suppose I could fuck you.

89
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,430
That would work.

90
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,190
Hey. You okay?

91
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:07,730
Yeah. Great.

92
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:15,130
- How was your trip? - I don't know.

93
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:18,100
Cities.

94
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:22,170
They're all starting to look the same. They really are.

95
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:32,450
And the pasta in Rome is not as good as yours.

96
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:36,220
And the ass pinchers.

97
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:38,850
They used to look so charmingly European.

98
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:40,860
Not as good as me?

99
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:47,300
Come on.

100
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,470
It really must be what it is about you I like...

101
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:53,030
because you most definitely are not common.

102
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,080
- What if I were? - What if you were what?

103
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:05,210
A little more common,you know,and around more.

104
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:07,220
How much more?

105
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:09,380
Like,"all the time" more.

106
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,790
And I was just a jazz club owner and not that other thing.

107
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,260
How would you feel about that?

108
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,320
Hey,are you saying what I think you're saying?

109
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,930
I think that's what I'm saying.

110
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:29,610
Hey,baby,you know I've never asked you to change anything for me.

111
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,770
I know that. I'm just asking you,how would you feel about that?

112
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,450
I don't know.

113
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,790
I suppose I'd have to give it some serious thought.

114
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:52,730
Then you'd better start giving it some serious thought.

115
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:05,640
Thank you. So I'll see you when I see you?

116
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,650
See you when I see you.

117
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:50,020
Excuse me. Can you help me,please?

118
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,290
Can you help me?

119
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,490
- Place Norman? - Yes,yes.

120
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,090
You go to the corner,make a right. Go two blocks...

121
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:01,330
- Two. - Two blocks,then a left one block.

122
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,870
- Again,please. - Two blocks this way...

123
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,500
one block that way to the left.

124
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:08,130
- And you're right there. - Okay,thank you.

125
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:09,770
Thank you,Nick.

126
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,810
What did you say?

127
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,440
I said,"Thank you,Nick."

128
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:22,810
I'm Max's guy in the customshouse. We should talk.

129
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,380
Okay,bye-bye. Thank you.

130
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,400
Thank you. Bye.

131
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,230
- Where's Max? - He's in the sunroom.

132
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,910
Nicoli,Nicoli.

133
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:46,210
Have you lost your fucking mind?

134
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,250
My mind? Years ago. Why?

135
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,250
- What did you tell this kid? - What did I tell who?

136
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,310
Your inside guy with the retard act.

137
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:56,480
He was in front of my house. He knew who I was.

138
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:02,390
Wait. He must've followed me to the club and made you from there.

139
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,860
Tell him he pulls a stunt like that again,he'll end up in the hospital.

140
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:09,170
Wait. Do you think I'm gonna set you up with a jerk-off heister?

141
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,500
You gotta admit that this kid did a pretty good dog and pony show.

142
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:16,410
I don't care who is he. Don't expose me like that. You know better.

143
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,910
He's got it all pre-wired.

144
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,350
- You go in,turn the key... - I told you,I'm not interested.

145
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:23,780
You're never gonna get another chance at a score like this.

146
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,810
- Why are you pushing this? - Four million balls.

147
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,720
How many times do I have to tell you?

148
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,520
He's pushing it because we're running out of time.

149
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:33,320
If I'm gonna work with a partner on this...

150
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,260
we gotta start putting our heads together right away.

151
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:36,800
- What are you doing in my house? - Take it easy.

152
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:39,600
- All I'm saying... - Who the fuck is this kid?

153
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:42,360
- What the fuck do you know? - I've been on this for three weeks.

154
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,410
I gotta know if you're the guy that Max says you are.

155
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,640
- I gotta go. - Nick,wait. Wait.

156
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:53,850
I didn't come 500 miles just to... Jack Teller. Nice to meet you too.

157
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,850
What the fuck?

158
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,750
You're not smart enough to know where your dick is.

159
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:00,950
We decided that you were gonna sit tight until I called you.

160
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,390
- Is that correct? - Okay.

161
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,260
I thought I could help you sell him on it. I thought he was already in.

162
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:08,790
Don't be so fucking creative. Just get the fuck out of my house.

163
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:12,460
When you guys get your shit together,give me a call,okay?

164
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:13,800
Unbelievable.

165
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:23,040
It's a lucky thing you came my way

166
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:26,470
Today

167
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:30,610
I'm about to tell you something you should know

168
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,550
All you have to do is let the plot unfold

169
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,830
Desire is clear

170
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,590
When you are near

171
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,630
You're about to give in

172
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:52,440
Don't tease me so

173
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:53,940
I think you know

174
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:56,240
You're about to give in

175
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:02,550
And if you listen we can both find peace

176
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,790
Release

177
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:10,380
Inhibitions that you thought could not be there

178
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,320
Jesus!

179
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,330
God! Jesus! Take it easy.

180
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:29,640
Listen close. Leave town tonight. Don't come back.

181
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:32,830
I see you again,I break your fucking knees.

182
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:34,400
I see you around Nick,I'll kill ya.

183
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,540
It's a dangerous fucking game you're playing here.

184
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:39,270
Are we clear?

185
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:47,190
Yeah,we're clear.

186
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,060
How did it go?

187
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,600
Not as planned.

188
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:36,730
- What do you want? - Some fucking respect for starters.

189
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:41,570
I mean,what are you thinking? Now,I'm on a job here.

190
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,610
Now,if you just don't wanna come in on it,that's fine. Say "no."

191
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,550
But don't send some third-rate rent-a-thug to brush me off.

192
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,240
You can do it like a professional.

193
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:53,220
Hello.

194
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,490
Yeah. You okay?

195
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,990
He's right here. Don't worry. Just go home.

196
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:03,290
I'll call you later,all right? That's okay.

197
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,800
Okay.

198
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:08,100
I didn't come here to cause any trouble.

199
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:09,640
I didn't.

200
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:14,540
Coming up to you on the street like that,that was a stupid move.

201
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:16,840
Sorry. Why don't we just call it even?

202
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:19,510
I just wanna say one thing to you,then I'll go away.

203
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:22,020
We don't have to bother each other anymore if you don't want.

204
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:28,210
I have been casing this place for a couple of weeks now.

205
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:31,990
It's a little bit complicated,but this is a very doable job.

206
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:35,330
I can handle the system in there if someone can break into this box.

207
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:39,070
Look,I don't know you,you don't know me.

208
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:41,630
I know that's not the best way to do things,but...

209
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,300
I am very good at what I do,okay?

210
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:48,140
And I take it very,very seriously. You can check it out with Max.

211
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:51,480
Now,if you are the guy that he says you are...

212
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:54,310
then we should check this out.

213
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,320
Just... Just take a look at it.

214
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:59,320
That's all I'm saying,'cause this is a very big payoff...

215
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,320
for very acceptable risks.

216
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,560
Just take a look at it. Go look for yourself.

217
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,860
I like your place.

218
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,870
You got good taste.

219
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:01,200
Oh,Jesus. It's nice and dark in here.

220
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,270
Fucking everything.

221
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:08,110
Jesus.

222
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,850
Why don't you jump for some lights in this place?

223
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:15,580
Every time I come in here,it's like hide-and-go-seek.

224
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,590
How are you?

225
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:33,200
Now,you gotta tell me the...

226
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:35,970
the magic word.

227
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,880
All right,I'm gonna do it.

228
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:42,020
Good,good. Jesus,sweetheart. You're a sweetheart.

229
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:44,050
Bravo. You're making sense.

230
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:49,120
But because of the risk involved,my end's gotta be six million.

231
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,220
Operator?

232
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:56,090
I got a nut down here that just said six million.

233
00:29:57,430 --> 00:30:00,270
No,no. Send paramedics. I think... Are you all right?

234
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,390
I'm fine.

235
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:04,130
Six fucking million dollars? What happened to four?

236
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:07,830
I'm doing it in my backyard. I'm not gonna go like that. I'm sorry.

237
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:09,840
If you want me to do this,you gotta pay me what's right.

238
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:12,970
- It's gotta be that way. - I always pay you what's right.

239
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:16,310
You always think you do. I always know what you pay me.

240
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:19,150
It's not always right. I need this for this.

241
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:22,190
I like your style.

242
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,190
Yeah,well,okay. I understand.

243
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:29,020
That's what I have to do. I wanna pay off the club,the mortgage.

244
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,830
I wanna own this place free and clear.

245
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:33,420
I want it to be mine. I live the way I want.

246
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,800
Because after this,no more jobs.

247
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:38,130
This is the last one I'm doing. I'm quitting for good.

248
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:40,900
How many times have you told me that in 25 years?

249
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:43,270
I'm gonna believe that when the pigs eat my brother.

250
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:46,680
- Right? - I'm done. I'm done. No more.

251
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:52,490
Well,okay. I hope she's worth it.

252
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:58,530
Here's numb-nuts.

253
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:04,330
Nice house,nice club. You must be really good.

254
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,700
I don't wanna have to do this,but raise your arms.

255
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,380
- Be my guest. - He's all right.

256
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,110
Okay?

257
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:30,190
Is this a social call? What are we doing here?

258
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:33,790
I will explore this with you...

259
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:36,700
but I run this operation down to the smallest detail.

260
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:40,030
If you have a problem with that,we can all go home right now.

261
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:42,500
Is there a problem with that?

262
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,330
That's fine.

263
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:48,470
You will tell me everything you know,then I will design the plan.

264
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:52,410
If I smell something about the job or you that I don't like,I walk.

265
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,570
If I think for one second you're not living up to your end of it...

266
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,410
or if you hold out on me in any way,I walk.

267
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:00,980
- Understood? - That's fine.

268
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,610
Tell me what you wanna know.

269
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:07,920
- First,what are we looking for? - You know what a scepter is?

270
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,960
It's something that a king holds.

271
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,790
Right there.

272
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:17,130
It was made in 1661 in France for a special coronation...

273
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,030
for a girl queen.

274
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:23,940
- It's priceless. - Not to us,it's not.

275
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:27,070
What can you give me on its specific location?

276
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:29,450
I can give you the whole building,okay? I got floor plans.

277
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,150
I've been clocking the security patterns for over three weeks.

278
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,380
All right. Paint me a picture.

279
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,250
Okay. He fixed me up with the job.

280
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:40,790
Not me but Brian,the guy on the street.

281
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,190
Yeah,I remember.

282
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:45,100
Is he traceable? Phone number? Address? That stuff?

283
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:47,500
It's totally tight. The guy's a charity case,a favor.

284
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:49,590
The guy truly doesn't even exist on paper.

285
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:52,770
He just shows up. He's the assistant janitor...

286
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:54,540
midnight to 8 a.m.

287
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:01,580
The security's pretty basic.

288
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:04,080
At night,they lock the place down. They bar the ground floor windows.

289
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:07,710
You can only enter in through one place,out by the truck court.

290
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:13,950
Thank you,Hubert. Thank you.

291
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:16,790
Manpower's very light. They got one guy sitting in a booth outside...

292
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:19,200
just keeping an eye on things.

293
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:24,770
On the inside,everyone comes in through a standard metal detector.

294
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:28,940
It's tricky bringing things through,but I've got that figured out.

295
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:31,740
All the guards know me now,so no one really looks too close.

296
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:34,180
- Okay,thank you. - All right.

297
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:36,580
Once I'm inside,I can go anywhere I want.

298
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:38,120
Hey,Laurent.

299
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:41,880
Everything gets run from this one little central command console.

300
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:45,760
They've got fixed video systems in the elevators and in the hallways.

301
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,920
They got a couple magnetic doors,but it's all very basic.

302
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,590
Lots of overtime. Not so much now.

303
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:54,970
Now,the head janitor's this old guy,Danny.

304
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,400
He loves Brian. Loves him.

305
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:59,870
I've got this guy completely wrapped around my finger.

306
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:02,340
He'd do anything for me.

307
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:04,440
And most of the time,he's got me working with him.

308
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:06,310
Kind of low-level shit,just helping out.

309
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:09,750
But I can get away from him plenty. I got all kinds of reasons.

310
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:13,280
I've sketched half the place already. I've copied a lot of keys.

311
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:16,550
I can get you access to basically any room in the place.

312
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,150
Where's the scepter?

313
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:21,130
Well,see,that's the kink.

314
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,750
Now,get this.

315
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:25,770
It was arranged to be brought into the country...

316
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:29,790
inside the leg of an antique piano.

317
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:33,670
And it was so simple. Then they impounded it.

318
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,710
I mean,can you guess why?

319
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:38,610
Fucking bugs.

320
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:42,210
I mean,the whole shipment was contaminated with termites.

321
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,220
Asian longhorn beetles.

322
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,250
We got fucked by bugs.

323
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:51,220
These things burrow into the wood...

324
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:53,160
so they were in the crates of most of the shipment.

325
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:55,720
So they took the goods out and delivered most of them.

326
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,600
But the piano is made of wood too,so they impounded it.

327
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,790
They took the whole thing and put it in quarantine.

328
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,530
Medium security,third-floor lockup.

329
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:05,160
They're really scared of these things...

330
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,940
and they can't send them back to France.

331
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:11,770
So they decided to burn everything.

332
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:22,760
Now,I'll tell ya...

333
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:25,160
I didn't know which one of the fucking legs this thing is in...

334
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:28,350
but half of me was tempted to grab them all and make a break for it.

335
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:32,260
I mean,I don't know if this thing's gonna melt or what.

336
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:35,630
I mean,I was dying.

337
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:41,510
I had to improvise a little.

338
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:48,510
- L-I saw something in the fire. - We're just burning stuff.

339
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:52,780
No. Look,look. I saw something in the...

340
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:56,220
Piano. In the piano,I saw a... Look.

341
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:57,380
- I saw something. - Jack!

342
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,850
There! There!

343
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,000
What is it?

344
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:16,110
So everybody's freaking out.

345
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,340
Nobody knows what this is or what to do with it.

346
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:20,350
They don't see this kind of excitement down there.

347
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:22,410
So they call some supervisor. They get him out of bed.

348
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,880
He comes down,he takes one look at this thing.

349
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:28,150
He doesn't know what the hell it is,but he knows it's worth a lot.

350
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:31,210
He tells them,until they can sort it out,put it in the basement.

351
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:34,120
- And that's what they do. - Don't worry. Don't worry.

352
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,690
- Don't worry about it. - I want to see,Danny.

353
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,460
- Can I see? - No. Come on. Let's go now.

354
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,930
Okay. Bye-bye. Bye.

355
00:36:57,450 --> 00:36:59,080
The basement in the customshouse...

356
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,450
is the most secure lockup in eastern Canada.

357
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,920
It was built as a bomb shelter during the Cold War.

358
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:07,520
All their important stuff's there... state's evidence,narcotics...

359
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,320
confiscated weapons.

360
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,160
That scepter is in a safe somewhere in this room.

361
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,260
But the thing is,there's no... there's no cameras.

362
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:17,030
If there was,I would've seen an angle on the video monitors.

363
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:20,770
So if we can put you inside that room,you can work on it all night.

364
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:26,470
We'll need pictures of the safe or a model number from their files.

365
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:29,880
Then we're gonna need plans... infrastructure maps...

366
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:33,150
blueprints,schematics,anything we can get our hands on.

367
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:35,120
That's all I got for now,but give me two days.

368
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:37,660
We just gotta find a way to get into that basement.

369
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,260
You gonna let it go,or are we gonna drive around pissed all night?

370
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,960
Why don't you kiss my ass?

371
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:52,320
- We're about set up. You ready? - Hold on.

372
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,880
- Wanna give me a mark? - Not yet. Not yet.

373
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,530
How you doing?

374
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,040
Stay off the air until I call.

375
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:55,430
Three-three,two-six...

376
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,830
two-nine,three-two.

377
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:03,600
I repeat:33,26,29,32.

378
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:07,770
Copy that. Three-three,two-six,two-nine,three-two.

379
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:15,580
Make a right. Proceed east about 20 yards.

380
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:17,580
You should see the next opening.

381
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,590
I'm at a wall here,a cinder block wall...

382
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,460
where you told me I have to go.

383
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:32,800
Are you sure about that? It shows a straight shot on here.

384
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:35,500
It's not my imagination. I'm right here in front of it.

385
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:37,940
You wanna come down here and see for yourself?

386
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,270
Right. Okay,okay. Hold on.

387
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:46,510
All right,just give me a second.

388
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:52,250
- Can you read me? - Make a left. Go about 20 feet.

389
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,880
You should run into a parallel tunnel.

390
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,420
Make a right. You'll be right back on course.

391
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:02,890
Take the tunnel about 150 yards due west.

392
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,300
You'll reach a "T" junction. Tell me when you're there.

393
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:06,800
About 300 yards.

394
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:09,740
- Came to the end. Made a right. - Head northwest.

395
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,570
Northeast. Check that. Northeast.

396
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,070
One second. Hold on.

397
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:17,270
- Are you with me? - Going west. Going west.

398
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:22,080
- I'm going west. I'm in a circle. - Make a right. Go 40 yards east.

399
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:26,110
Then make a left turn. Go about...

400
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:28,210
Make a right. Head back.

401
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,760
You got maybe 500 yards to go.

402
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,370
Straight ahead 20 feet,and you should be dead under the room.

403
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,990
The tunnel will keep on going.

404
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:45,540
But look up. You should see the access ladder.

405
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,100
I'm at a shaft. I'm gonna climb up.

406
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:08,490
What are you doing?

407
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:10,660
Still climbing.

408
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:34,510
This looks like it.

409
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:08,840
I'm done.

410
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:22,720
What the hell is this?

411
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,690
Hey,you got a utility crew all over the entrance.

412
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,700
You're gonna have to find another way out.

413
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,060
Where are you?

414
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,410
I'm at De La Montagne and Ottawa.

415
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,470
Repeat: De La Montagne and Ottawa.

416
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:22,480
Got it. We're on our way.

417
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,260
This should be it,right here.

418
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:35,390
We're here. I'm just trying to find you.

419
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,930
There. He's right over there.

420
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:02,020
Okay,you're all clear.

421
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:04,020
I'm coming out.

422
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,870
Hello.

423
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:53,410
Anybody home?

424
00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:14,720
- Champagne. - Yeah.

425
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:17,020
- Nice touch. - Nice dress.

426
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,930
You like? Thank you.

427
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:25,930
So,you asked me a question a couple of days ago.

428
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:28,440
And you gave it some serious thought?

429
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:31,340
Actually,I forgot the question.

430
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:36,310
Here's my answer.

431
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:37,910
You're not holding up your glass.

432
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:39,280
I'm sorry.

433
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:44,320
My father was a lawyer... very smart man...

434
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:47,720
and he would always say that a deal is only good...

435
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:51,630
if it leaves both parties feeling as if they gave up something.

436
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:54,930
Is an answer coming soon? 'Cause the glass is getting heavy.

437
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,400
Okay.

438
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:01,700
I will change my life...

439
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:03,710
I will move here...

440
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:06,910
I will love you...

441
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:12,680
and believe that this is the best decision that I've made.

442
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:17,450
But I will not move here if it means that one day...

443
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:19,250
I might have to talk to you through glass.

444
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,760
I won't move here if it means spending my nights worrying.

445
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:27,390
So if you can promise me,as of right now,that you're through...

446
00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:31,660
then we can drink to making changes.

447
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:43,020
L... I said you could drink now.

448
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:44,140
I know.

449
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:46,780
I wanna do all that.

450
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:52,690
I just have to tell you that I'm gonna do one more thing...

451
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:54,850
- and that's it. - Oh,fuck.

452
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,400
Everything you said is great. It's perfect.

453
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:00,760
I just have one more thing I have to do.

454
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:03,500
You put that out there when you knew you couldn't follow through.

455
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:06,400
I put it out there because... I am following through.

456
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:08,440
- This is my last one. I promise. - Sure it is.

457
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:10,530
I promise you it is my last one.

458
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:13,270
Then quit. Quit now.

459
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:16,440
- What does "one last one" mean? - It means we don't need anything.

460
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:20,380
I didn't need anything before,and I don't need anything now...

461
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:22,680
but what I wanted was to be with you.

462
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:26,320
And what I didn't need was exactly this kind of painful bullshit.

463
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:30,990
My life wasn't perfect before,but at least we were clear.

464
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:34,700
Give me some...

465
00:49:37,070 --> 00:49:38,940
I'll see you when I see you.

466
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:52,270
Hey,what are you doing?

467
00:50:52,350 --> 00:50:55,110
Somebody put fingerprints on my window,Danny.

468
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:58,450
- You don't need to do it. - I like a clean window,Danny.

469
00:50:58,520 --> 00:50:59,750
It's all right.

470
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:02,980
We missed you last night. You feeling better?

471
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,550
- Yes,thank you. - Sure?

472
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:05,820
Yes,I'm okay. Thank you,Danny.

473
00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:09,560
- Take your time. Okay,bye-bye. - Bye-bye.

474
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:10,720
Bye.

475
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:29,680
That's your safe.

476
00:51:34,890 --> 00:51:37,980
Traeger standing jeweler's safe,this year's model.

477
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:41,320
If it's new,it's gonna be tough to get the schematics.

478
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:43,390
I've got all this year's books.

479
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:45,860
- Really? - Yeah. What else?

480
00:51:45,930 --> 00:51:49,200
Okay,the system's Ironclad Security.

481
00:51:49,270 --> 00:51:50,900
They're a big commercial industrial outfit.

482
00:51:50,970 --> 00:51:53,270
They handle a lot of the government buildings here.

483
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:56,470
Now,this building's pretty old. The lines are all over the place.

484
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:59,540
They're easy to find. I can cut in three or four different places...

485
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:03,340
and let you in from there,but I need the engineering pass codes.

486
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:04,970
I've been looking. They don't keep them in here.

487
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:08,380
They'll be at Ironclad. I don't know what to do.

488
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:09,750
Okay.

489
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:13,360
What,are you calling someone now?

490
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:20,400
- What? Who is this? - It's me. Turn down the music.

491
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:25,400
Hey,Nick,I am fucked up.

492
00:52:25,470 --> 00:52:27,840
My mother's totally out of control.

493
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:29,540
Listen. Listen carefully.

494
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:31,300
Ironclad Security.

495
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:33,400
- Big outfit. - Yeah.

496
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:36,010
I need engineering pass codes for the customshouse.

497
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:38,070
I don't know,man. My concentration's shot.

498
00:52:38,190 --> 00:52:41,450
I haven't slept in,like,a month. Wait. What customshouse?

499
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:43,280
Montreal.

500
00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:47,220
You're not pissing in our own pool,man.

501
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:49,890
You have always said you were never gonna do a job here in Montreal.

502
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:52,630
- I know. I know. Can you do it? - Steven!

503
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:54,500
Who are you talking to at this hour?

504
00:52:54,570 --> 00:52:58,730
I am having a fucking conversation with a friend of mine,Mother!

505
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:03,030
- Are you... Are you okay? - She is a ghoul.

506
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:05,540
Now,tell me exactly what you want.

507
00:53:05,610 --> 00:53:09,570
Just one second. Here's someone who can tell you what we need.

508
00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:12,050
Just tell him what you need.

509
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:15,350
I need separate disarm and reset master codes for the whole system...

510
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:17,790
and I need the individual sector bypass codes...

511
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:21,450
so I can shut down one zone without lighting off the whole board.

512
00:53:21,530 --> 00:53:23,590
- Okay? - Yes.

513
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:26,860
- You got that? - Got it.

514
00:53:26,930 --> 00:53:29,490
Now,listen,I'm gonna need this within 48 hours.

515
00:53:29,570 --> 00:53:31,400
If you do that,I'll double your last price.

516
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:35,040
Dude,give me a Kaypro 64 and a live dial tone...

517
00:53:35,110 --> 00:53:37,370
and I can do anything.

518
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:42,280
Oh,now you are going to die.

519
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:46,150
This is someone you work with?

520
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:48,480
And you're giving me a hard time.

521
00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:22,910
Thursday,8:07 a.m.

522
00:54:22,990 --> 00:54:25,960
Hi. I got your message. One of the stewardesses is sick...

523
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:29,120
so I have to cover for her on a New York run.

524
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:32,030
We have to talk when I come through in a couple of days.

525
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:34,030
Okay? Bye.

526
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:37,170
End of messages.

527
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:49,740
Just lock it.

528
00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:53,220
- You work here? - No. Here.

529
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:03,250
Come on.

530
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,360
Come on. Come on in.

531
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:23,050
Want some coffee?

532
00:55:28,590 --> 00:55:32,220
Jeez. Is this what we're dealing with?

533
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:38,530
Page 720.

534
00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:48,000
- Where can I get one of these? - You gotta know the right people.

535
00:55:48,070 --> 00:55:50,980
Traeger floor safe. Here it is.

536
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:54,710
Solid steel body.

537
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:57,110
Filled door with aluminum and cobalt.

538
00:55:58,050 --> 00:56:01,040
Half-inch hard plate. Double dial.

539
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,080
You're gonna need two,three hours to drill through that.

540
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:07,990
- You can't drill this. - Why not?

541
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:11,360
'Cause this is a newer model and it's got these glass packs.

542
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:14,760
See the glass pack here? See?

543
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:18,000
Drill through that,the glass breaks and those bolts spring into place.

544
00:56:18,070 --> 00:56:19,800
You're fucked. They're locked. Forget it.

545
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:22,100
You can't break it with a bulldozer.

546
00:56:22,210 --> 00:56:24,840
I've never seen anything like that. What do you have in mind?

547
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:27,940
I don't know,but if somebody built it,somebody can unbuild it.

548
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:42,030
Yeah,see,when I shut this down,you'll see this light go off...

549
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:44,590
but up in the booth,nothing will register.

550
00:56:47,970 --> 00:56:50,560
- Is that your box? - That's it.

551
00:56:50,670 --> 00:56:52,660
That's a fucking monster. That's three times the size of this.

552
00:56:52,770 --> 00:56:54,260
Even bigger than that.

553
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:57,640
See that over there?

554
00:56:57,740 --> 00:57:00,710
You can see it better over here.

555
00:57:00,810 --> 00:57:03,810
That's an active infrared post.

556
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,940
I don't know. That wasn't on the system specs.

557
00:57:06,050 --> 00:57:09,490
That's gotta be some independent loop they set up just in the cage.

558
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:12,390
I'll take care of it.

559
00:57:18,430 --> 00:57:23,460
All right,just calm down,okay? I'll be over in a few minutes.

560
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:26,900
I gotta take care of something. I'll drop you off.

561
00:57:52,070 --> 00:57:54,230
My mom's only out for about a half an hour.

562
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:03,060
I was cruising around Ironclad's server at the root COBOL level...

563
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:08,050
when someone counter-cracked me,hacked into my machines,my data.

564
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:10,010
For three minutes,I was fully exposed.

565
00:58:10,050 --> 00:58:14,380
Now I have to fire wall my whole operations all from scratch.

566
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:18,050
- Can you tell me that in English? - Sorry.

567
00:58:18,090 --> 00:58:21,030
I was a few keystrokes away from pulling those engineering codes...

568
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:23,190
when I bump into a guy on the other end.

569
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:26,100
- And what's on the other end? - Ironclad's computers.

570
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:28,330
My guess is he's some low-level systems administrator.

571
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:33,570
So,we switch to a private chat room,and he sends me this.

572
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:36,370
Can you believe that?

573
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:39,640
The guy comes into my world and calls me an asshole.

574
00:58:39,710 --> 00:58:42,770
- Can you get me the bypass codes? - I type,"How much?" He types...

575
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:44,680
"Engineering codes for the customshouse basement?"

576
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:46,810
I say,"You guessed it,Blue's Clues."

577
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:48,950
And he says,"Fuck you." And I say,"No,fuck you."

578
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:51,720
And he says,"No,fuck you." I'm like,"No,fuck you."

579
00:58:51,790 --> 00:58:53,690
Then he's like,"No,fuck..."

580
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:56,250
Can you get me the bypass codes?

581
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:01,330
The guy wants 50 thou in exchange for the codes.

582
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:04,300
- Fifty thousand. - Yes.

583
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:08,410
Get the account number.

584
00:59:08,470 --> 00:59:10,600
I'll wire the money,and he'll deliver the codes through you.

585
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:12,170
Negative. The guy won't go for a transfer.

586
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:14,680
He wants cash and he wants to do it in person.

587
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:17,740
- Anything else? - No.

588
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:20,790
You set it up. I'll let myself out.

589
00:59:20,850 --> 00:59:23,910
When this score's done,I'm gonna brute this creep with everything.

590
00:59:23,990 --> 00:59:27,620
By the time I'm done with this fuck,he won't be able to hide in Bolivia!

591
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:59,350
Jesus. Look at all these people.

592
00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:02,330
Who sets up a meeting in a public park?

593
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,200
- You see him? - Still looking.

594
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:27,680
Got him. He brought backup.

595
01:00:29,290 --> 01:00:31,280
Okay,I got him.

596
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:46,940
Hey,how ya doin'? Good to see ya.

597
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:50,030
Shake my hand. That's right. You my guy?

598
01:00:50,110 --> 01:00:51,340
Yeah.

599
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:54,540
- Who's this? - Cousin.

600
01:00:54,610 --> 01:00:58,240
Cousin? Okay. See the guy over my left shoulder...

601
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:03,520
back there on the bench,reading the paper,the big one?

602
01:01:03,590 --> 01:01:07,150
That's my cousin,okay?

603
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:11,250
So we've all got family here,which is nice,I think. Yeah? Okay.

604
01:01:11,330 --> 01:01:15,860
Let me give you that. Look inside and make sure you're happy.

605
01:01:20,470 --> 01:01:21,840
No,don't take that out.

606
01:01:21,910 --> 01:01:24,970
Hey,man,don't give me orders. I get orders all day,okay?

607
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:27,100
Can't count the money in a public place.

608
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:29,480
That's why you don't set a meeting in a park.

609
01:01:29,550 --> 01:01:31,380
Just for future reference.

610
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:34,650
Just flip through it in the bag.

611
01:01:36,190 --> 01:01:38,420
We're about set to go here. You ready?

612
01:01:38,490 --> 01:01:39,690
What the fuck is that?

613
01:01:39,790 --> 01:01:42,630
He's gonna give me the numbers,and I'm gonna read 'em into this mike...

614
01:01:42,730 --> 01:01:44,660
to a friend of mine who's gonna check 'em out.

615
01:01:48,170 --> 01:01:50,500
Did you think I was gonna write it down on a cocktail napkin?

616
01:01:51,270 --> 01:01:54,330
- Okay,ready. - Okay,you're on.

617
01:01:56,140 --> 01:01:59,870
First set: 3-1-7.

618
01:01:59,950 --> 01:02:03,010
- 3-1-7. - Got it. 3-1-7.

619
01:02:03,050 --> 01:02:07,350
Steven,3-1-7.

620
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:09,980
Confirm 3-1-7.

621
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:19,830
Just be a second. Are you guys maternal cousins?

622
01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:36,610
- First numbers are clean. - They're clean. They're clean.

623
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:38,980
You tell the hack at the other end of that wire...

624
01:02:39,050 --> 01:02:41,850
he tries to get in my system again,I will fry him,okay?

625
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:43,750
Why don't we worry about next time next time,okay?

626
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:45,880
Let's get this done before people start looking at us.

627
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:49,050
- Give me the second set. - 9-4-6.

628
01:02:49,130 --> 01:02:52,060
- 9-4-6. - 9-4-6.

629
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:56,160
Repeat: 9-4-6. 9-4-6.

630
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:05,910
- Take it easy. Relax. Have a smoke. - I don't smoke.

631
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:10,040
Me either,so good for us. You guys local? You live here?

632
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:12,850
Why are you asking so many fucking questions?

633
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:21,420
- They're good. - Second set is good.

634
01:03:21,490 --> 01:03:23,020
What's the third one?

635
01:03:25,330 --> 01:03:27,270
5-8-3-9.

636
01:03:27,330 --> 01:03:29,530
5-8-3-9.

637
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:32,090
5-8-3-9. Got it.

638
01:03:32,170 --> 01:03:35,660
5-8-3-9.

639
01:03:45,150 --> 01:03:47,420
This is taking too long. I'm gonna fuckin' lose it.

640
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:49,320
Shut up,Eric.

641
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:52,550
They have to verify the numbers off the server. It takes some time.

642
01:03:52,630 --> 01:03:54,150
Just relax,Eric.

643
01:03:57,700 --> 01:03:59,600
Can you help me out? It's turning into amateur hour out here.

644
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:02,360
- Fuck you,asshole. - What are you doing?

645
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:03,990
One of them has a gun.

646
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:06,130
Burt,big guy's got a gun.

647
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:08,000
Steven,how's it going? We're losing these guys.

648
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:10,980
- I'm working it,man. - Steven,want some lunch?

649
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:13,380
I'm on the phone,bitch!

650
01:04:13,450 --> 01:04:14,640
- You all right? - We're fine.

651
01:04:14,710 --> 01:04:19,550
Don't anybody move. Eric,look at my hand right now.

652
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:25,220
If you take that out,I'm gonna take this out,be a big fuckin' mess.

653
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:27,790
Put it away,Eric.

654
01:04:27,890 --> 01:04:30,020
There's kids all around. What are you thinking?

655
01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:34,970
Put it away. Take a deep breath and just put it in your back pocket.

656
01:04:35,030 --> 01:04:37,230
Put it away.

657
01:04:40,940 --> 01:04:43,410
- They're all good. - Last set of numbers confirmed.

658
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:45,470
Last set of numbers confirmed. Let's get out of here.

659
01:04:56,090 --> 01:04:57,520
Next time,don't bring a gun.

660
01:04:57,590 --> 01:05:01,290
Listen,I thought I might need one,and I did.

661
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:03,520
- Now we've got the codes. - Don't bring a gun.

662
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:11,970
Jesus Christ.

663
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:15,870
I called. They said you hadn't checked in yet. No.

664
01:05:21,010 --> 01:05:23,350
So what time you getting in?

665
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:28,020
Come on,honey. Don't stay at a hotel.

666
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:30,610
Just come over to my place. I'll cook some...

667
01:05:42,570 --> 01:05:44,160
Yeah. Yeah.

668
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:46,640
I was just saying come to my place. I'll cook something.

669
01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:48,730
You know,we'll talk,okay?

670
01:05:52,810 --> 01:05:55,610
I'm thinkin' 'bout a place

671
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:58,380
I'm waitin'for the day

672
01:05:58,450 --> 01:06:02,890
When I will make my getaway

673
01:06:04,020 --> 01:06:07,120
Because as any fool can see

674
01:06:07,190 --> 01:06:09,680
There's nothin'here for me

675
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:13,460
But hurry up,boy bring that water

676
01:06:13,530 --> 01:06:16,000
Don't do things you shouldn't oughta

677
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:17,940
He's good.

678
01:06:19,710 --> 01:06:22,570
When you gotta be there?

679
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:26,670
I'll go in in a couple hours. I'm okay. I'm doin' fine.

680
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:30,880
Listen,tell me something. Tell me something.

681
01:06:30,950 --> 01:06:33,180
All the years you've been doing this...

682
01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:35,620
what's the biggest gamble you ever took?

683
01:06:35,690 --> 01:06:39,390
On the job. You know,biggest long shot.

684
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:41,650
I don't take long shots.

685
01:06:41,730 --> 01:06:44,250
I know you're careful. You know,I'm careful too.

686
01:06:44,330 --> 01:06:46,960
That's not what I mean. I mean...

687
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,560
When you were starting out,when you were just getting going...

688
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:52,500
you must have taken some fliers here and there.

689
01:06:52,570 --> 01:06:54,660
Done something that was a little wild. I'm just curious.

690
01:06:54,740 --> 01:06:56,570
Never took long shots.

691
01:07:00,410 --> 01:07:02,010
I'm gonna say something to you.

692
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:04,170
You're smart,you're talented and you know a few things...

693
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:07,450
but talent means nothing if you don't make the right choices.

694
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:10,920
There's talented people out there who never see daylight anymore.

695
01:07:10,990 --> 01:07:13,220
Last thing,it takes discipline...

696
01:07:13,290 --> 01:07:15,280
because this whole game is one big long shot...

697
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:17,590
and if you don't have the discipline to stay away from the fliers...

698
01:07:17,660 --> 01:07:20,660
or from the gambles or whatever else you wanna call a stupid move...

699
01:07:20,730 --> 01:07:24,000
then,my friend,I'm afraid to say,one day you will go down.

700
01:07:24,070 --> 01:07:25,560
It's inevitable.

701
01:07:26,370 --> 01:07:28,640
You want my advice?

702
01:07:29,410 --> 01:07:31,310
Make a list of everything you want now...

703
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:34,610
and plan on spending the next 25 years of your life getting it.

704
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:37,550
Slowly,piece by piece.

705
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,480
I see what you're sayin'.

706
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:52,420
But still,I'm lookin' at you,and you got all this already...

707
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:55,130
and you're sittin' here with me,workin' with a partner...

708
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:58,230
in the city where you live,on a job that's gotten more complicated...

709
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:00,770
than you thought it was gonna be.

710
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:03,330
So I know you're still takin' a shot at something.

711
01:08:09,250 --> 01:08:11,440
I gotta go.

712
01:08:13,250 --> 01:08:15,450
See ya tomorrow.

713
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:24,660
The maintenance crews come in the tunnels by 6 a.m.

714
01:08:24,730 --> 01:08:26,700
I gotta be back in the hole by 5:30.

715
01:08:26,770 --> 01:08:29,130
As soon as the guards leave,you gotta tell me right away.

716
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:31,430
- You can't be late. - I'm not worried about my end.

717
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:36,500
I'm wondering how you're gonna break that safe in half an hour.

718
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:38,300
You know,I mean...

719
01:08:57,200 --> 01:09:00,600
- Is that even possible? - Just physics.

720
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:08,030
- How long is that gonna take? - Twelve,fifteen minutes,tops.

721
01:09:08,070 --> 01:09:10,230
Fifteen minutes,tops?

722
01:09:12,010 --> 01:09:15,040
Okay. Okay.

723
01:09:15,110 --> 01:09:19,310
Then if you're on the box by 5:00,the prize goes in the bag by 5:15.

724
01:09:19,390 --> 01:09:22,680
- You got no problem at all. - 5:15,5:30,I'm back in the hole.

725
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:26,020
- You reset the system. - That's perfect.

726
01:09:26,090 --> 01:09:28,220
I'll pack up my shit. I can meet you here.

727
01:09:28,290 --> 01:09:31,560
- We can go to Max,or I can... - We're not gonna meet back here.

728
01:09:31,630 --> 01:09:34,220
- I'll meet you at Max's,then. - No.

729
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:37,330
You'll finish out your shift. I go to Max. He does his thing.

730
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:39,230
He pays us off. We never see each other again.

731
01:09:39,310 --> 01:09:42,300
Forget it. Just forget it. I'm gonna come with you to Max's.

732
01:09:42,370 --> 01:09:45,000
- We'll deliver it together. - No,you're not.

733
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:48,040
Listen. I've done this down to the last detail.

734
01:09:48,110 --> 01:09:50,600
Don't put me on the sideline when it's time to collect.

735
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:53,050
- Don't do it. - Listen to me.

736
01:09:53,090 --> 01:09:55,450
You do anything out of the ordinary,you're gonna get made.

737
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:59,510
Do you understand that? Be smart. Finish out your shift.

738
01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:06,420
- You're the boss. - Okay.

739
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:24,510
Steven got these from a supplier. They're throwaways.

740
01:10:24,580 --> 01:10:26,310
Totally untraceable.

741
01:10:30,590 --> 01:10:34,050
People are talking. They say Max is in trouble with Teddy Salida...

742
01:10:34,130 --> 01:10:37,100
and he's pullin' off a big job to get rid of him.

743
01:10:38,930 --> 01:10:40,870
That's what they say?

744
01:10:42,530 --> 01:10:45,090
Maybe you should walk away from this one.

745
01:12:12,590 --> 01:12:14,530
What are you doing down here?

746
01:12:14,590 --> 01:12:17,720
Jesus Christ,you scared the shit out of me.

747
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:21,490
What the hell are you doing down here?

748
01:12:21,570 --> 01:12:24,200
Did you involve Teddy Salida in this?

749
01:12:24,270 --> 01:12:27,640
- What? Teddy Salida? - Yeah.

750
01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:30,730
- Why would you say that? - I see these guys outside.

751
01:12:30,810 --> 01:12:33,330
They look like they might be with him.

752
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:36,880
How much you into him for?

753
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:38,920
Four million.

754
01:12:40,550 --> 01:12:42,040
Look,how do you think I got all this?

755
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:44,560
They gave it to me and the house in Bermuda?

756
01:12:44,620 --> 01:12:46,920
What's the matter with you?

757
01:12:47,590 --> 01:12:50,060
What's he know?

758
01:12:50,130 --> 01:12:53,190
- About what? - About what we're doing.

759
01:12:54,230 --> 01:12:57,530
Nothing. I told him I found something that would go for eight...

760
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:00,800
and that we'd split the profits,that's all.

761
01:13:01,910 --> 01:13:04,210
What are you actually selling the scepter for,Max?

762
01:13:06,650 --> 01:13:09,380
$30 million.

763
01:13:10,350 --> 01:13:13,980
Jesus. Max,what were you thinking?

764
01:13:14,050 --> 01:13:15,990
What was I thinking? The same thing you were thinking.

765
01:13:16,050 --> 01:13:21,190
How are we gonna get out from under all this bullshit we've been living?

766
01:13:21,260 --> 01:13:24,390
The chance came. Took it.

767
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:27,490
- It's gonna work out fine. - No,it's not.

768
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:30,130
- What do you mean,it's not? - It's not. It's a mess.

769
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:33,760
- It's not gonna work. - Wait. Wait a fuckin' minute.

770
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:38,000
This is absolutely clean,Nick. What are you worried about?

771
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:41,010
Jesus Christ,it's my ass on the line anyway,not yours.

772
01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:43,140
I'm not taking the biggest gamble of my life...

773
01:13:43,220 --> 01:13:45,210
so I can hand my money over to Teddy Salida.

774
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:48,520
You think you're not gonna get your fuckin' money?

775
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:50,320
Look,there's two things you gotta know.

776
01:13:50,390 --> 01:13:53,590
One is you're gonna get every fuckin' red cent.

777
01:13:53,660 --> 01:13:56,920
And,yeah,Teddy knows a little.

778
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,090
- He knows? - He does a little,I said.

779
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:02,930
- So you did lie? - Yeah,lied! Shit happens,man!

780
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,900
Christ Almighty!

781
01:14:04,970 --> 01:14:07,000
I lied for you and I lied for me.

782
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:10,570
I had to say something to get you to suit up,like always.

783
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:17,150
I'm sorry,but I'm not gonna do it.

784
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:22,450
It's a tiny door. Open the door. Take the shit.

785
01:14:22,550 --> 01:14:24,450
Close the door. We're out.

786
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:27,120
There's too much bullshit around it.

787
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:45,870
What's that?

788
01:14:58,020 --> 01:14:59,890
The buyer.

789
01:15:01,460 --> 01:15:04,360
Real simple. You call him when you get the scepter.

790
01:15:05,060 --> 01:15:08,000
He'll meet you at the airstrip 30 miles up the St. Lawrence.

791
01:15:08,030 --> 01:15:11,830
There's a little town called St. Croix.

792
01:15:13,370 --> 01:15:16,030
You give him the scepter,he gives you the cash.

793
01:15:16,110 --> 01:15:19,510
You take your cut and you wire me the rest.

794
01:15:19,610 --> 01:15:23,170
I'll give Teddy his,and you're clean.

795
01:15:27,590 --> 01:15:30,080
It's too risky.

796
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:32,120
Can't.

797
01:15:35,390 --> 01:15:38,160
You don't know what you're doin'.

798
01:15:38,230 --> 01:15:40,990
You know how long we go back?

799
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:44,590
Twenty-five years.

800
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:50,030
I'm gonna tell you something.

801
01:15:50,110 --> 01:15:54,240
For the first time in my life,I'm scared.

802
01:15:54,310 --> 01:15:56,800
I don't know why it is. I was never scared before...

803
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:59,680
but I'm scared now,Nick.

804
01:15:59,750 --> 01:16:03,920
And you're right about Teddy. He's gonna blow me away if he can.

805
01:16:03,990 --> 01:16:06,050
If I don't get him his money,he...

806
01:16:07,090 --> 01:16:09,460
Man,he...

807
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:16,630
Hey,don't-don't-don't-don't let me slide on this one.

808
01:16:16,700 --> 01:16:19,030
I can't afford it,man.

809
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:28,440
I can't... I can't scrap it out anymore.

810
01:16:28,510 --> 01:16:30,980
I gotta have some slack.

811
01:16:36,150 --> 01:16:38,150
All right. Okay.

812
01:16:40,460 --> 01:16:42,550
I hope you're not fuckin' me up.

813
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:01,070
I'm going down to check the power.

814
01:17:08,620 --> 01:17:12,450
- How much more equipment you got? - Here you go.

815
01:17:17,230 --> 01:17:18,990
- Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! - It's okay,Brian.

816
01:17:19,060 --> 01:17:21,290
- Come on in. - It's my radio.

817
01:17:21,370 --> 01:17:23,530
- Hey,what's all the commotion? - Don't worry,Danny.

818
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:25,760
- They're beefing things up. - What for?

819
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:28,430
- A few cameras in the basement. - Like we're gonna lose it,right?

820
01:17:28,510 --> 01:17:30,940
- Lose what? - That thing in the piano leg.

821
01:17:31,010 --> 01:17:34,970
- The big gold thing? - Some French national treasure.

822
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:39,070
- It's called a scepter. - Some expert saw those pictures.

823
01:17:39,150 --> 01:17:42,710
Now we're getting calls from the central office.

824
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:49,460
Hey,it's me. Yeah,we got a problem.

825
01:17:49,530 --> 01:17:53,400
They got a camera over the main door here,covering that.

826
01:17:53,470 --> 01:17:56,630
They got a camera here,looking right across the middle.

827
01:17:56,740 --> 01:17:59,800
They got one special just on the box...

828
01:17:59,870 --> 01:18:02,140
sees this entire cage.

829
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:05,640
This camera looking at the box...

830
01:18:05,740 --> 01:18:08,440
how high is it from the floor and how low is it from the ceiling?

831
01:18:08,510 --> 01:18:12,180
Probably 10,12 feet up off the floor.

832
01:18:12,250 --> 01:18:15,740
Four feet down from the ceiling. I think we're fucked.

833
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:20,750
So let me...

834
01:18:20,830 --> 01:18:23,120
When I'm here...

835
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:26,160
you'll cut the feed when I get across here,then you'll restore it.

836
01:18:26,230 --> 01:18:28,290
Then when I'm ready here,you'll cut it again...

837
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:30,660
and I'll go to work here.

838
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:33,630
I don't know about that,man.

839
01:18:33,710 --> 01:18:36,040
They know what it is so now they're gonna move it as soon as they can.

840
01:18:36,070 --> 01:18:40,640
We're not gonna get another chance. We gotta go now or we don't go at all.

841
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:10,670
Hi,Doug. Hi.

842
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:22,010
- Hi,Henri. - Hi,Brian.

843
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:28,650
- Okay. Thank you. - No problem.

844
01:20:28,750 --> 01:20:31,380
- Hi,Danny. - Hello,Brian.

845
01:20:31,490 --> 01:20:35,980
Oh,look at you. What fancy new shoes.

846
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:38,790
Yeah. Yeah,my mom got those for me.

847
01:20:38,930 --> 01:20:43,370
- Oh,your mom gave you those? - I think you got a girl.

848
01:20:43,470 --> 01:20:45,960
No girl,Danny. You're a stinker.

849
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:49,770
Well,you and your new shoes can give me a hand up on six tonight.

850
01:20:49,910 --> 01:20:52,970
We're gonna wax the whole cafeteria floor.

851
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:55,040
You hit the garbage. I'll get the stuff.

852
01:20:55,150 --> 01:20:57,640
I'll meet you there,what,15 minutes.

853
01:20:57,750 --> 01:20:59,720
Fifteen. Okay.

854
01:20:59,780 --> 01:21:05,420
Okay,I'll get the garbage,Danny. Okay? Bye-bye,Andre.

855
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:07,250
Bye-bye. You look good with those shoes.

856
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:10,020
Yeah,thanks. I know.

857
01:21:32,950 --> 01:21:34,890
Watch your step out there,Brian.

858
01:21:34,990 --> 01:21:36,950
I will. Thank you.

859
01:25:46,630 --> 01:25:49,250
Okay. Okay,Danny.

860
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:52,460
- Guess what time it is. - I don't know.

861
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:54,760
Yes,you do,Danny! It's lunchtime!

862
01:25:54,870 --> 01:25:56,960
All right,I'll tell you what.

863
01:25:57,070 --> 01:25:59,900
What do you say we keep on working,finish the other side,hmm?

864
01:25:59,910 --> 01:26:02,400
No,Danny. Why?

865
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:05,640
Then we can blow off the rest of the day and grab some pancakes.

866
01:26:05,750 --> 01:26:08,810
It won't take us long. Just throw a little extra thinner into the mix.

867
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:11,910
It'll go like butter.

868
01:26:59,630 --> 01:27:01,530
Danny,I am sorry.

869
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:03,760
It's okay. Just leave it. I'll mop it up.

870
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:05,930
- I'll go get some more. - You don't need to...

871
01:27:06,010 --> 01:27:08,670
- I will get some more. - All right.

872
01:27:08,740 --> 01:27:10,840
- You know where? Ground floor? - Okay.

873
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:12,900
You know the closet?

874
01:27:17,150 --> 01:27:19,520
Set to go. Set to go.

875
01:27:35,300 --> 01:27:36,860
Fuck.

876
01:27:40,870 --> 01:27:43,870
Are you there? I'm on my mark.

877
01:27:51,490 --> 01:27:53,850
- I'm on. Are you there? - I'm here. We're running late.

878
01:27:53,890 --> 01:27:55,380
I know. I hit a snag.

879
01:27:57,390 --> 01:28:00,330
I'm already all set up,though. Just give me one second.

880
01:28:06,570 --> 01:28:10,060
All right,I just gotta punch in these codes. Just sit tight.

881
01:28:30,290 --> 01:28:31,590
I got it.

882
01:28:31,660 --> 01:28:33,990
Hang on one more beat.

883
01:28:44,340 --> 01:28:46,100
It's clear. Get in there.

884
01:29:13,300 --> 01:29:17,170
I'm inside the first cage. Repeat: I am inside the first cage.

885
01:29:24,950 --> 01:29:26,410
You're all clear.

886
01:30:39,950 --> 01:30:43,750
- I'm set. Kill it. - All right,on my mark.

887
01:30:55,670 --> 01:30:56,860
Go.

888
01:31:01,170 --> 01:31:02,330
I'm here.

889
01:31:04,110 --> 01:31:06,040
There we go.

890
01:31:06,110 --> 01:31:08,510
Perfect. Tell me when you're in second position.

891
01:33:49,640 --> 01:33:51,510
Fuck.

892
01:34:35,190 --> 01:34:37,880
- How ya doin' down there? - Almost there.

893
01:34:55,340 --> 01:34:57,330
Do you know where is Brian?

894
01:34:58,580 --> 01:35:00,310
No idea.

895
01:36:00,110 --> 01:36:00,870
I'm ready.

896
01:36:01,710 --> 01:36:04,940
I need a second here. Hold on.

897
01:36:05,480 --> 01:36:07,950
I'm all set. Cut the cameras. Repeat:

898
01:36:08,050 --> 01:36:10,280
I'm all set. Cut the cameras.

899
01:36:13,650 --> 01:36:15,710
Gotta go. Got to go.

900
01:36:19,030 --> 01:36:21,050
What's up? What's up?

901
01:36:22,300 --> 01:36:25,030
I got company. I got company.

902
01:36:27,030 --> 01:36:29,000
Hang on one second.

903
01:36:29,100 --> 01:36:30,830
Just sit tight. I'll be right back.

904
01:37:02,840 --> 01:37:04,600
Okay.

905
01:37:21,450 --> 01:37:23,420
Jack,where are you?

906
01:37:27,890 --> 01:37:30,330
Jack,come in. Jack.

907
01:37:45,910 --> 01:37:48,400
Jack,are you there?

908
01:38:09,240 --> 01:38:11,200
I'm pulling out. Repeat: I'm pulling out.

909
01:38:11,300 --> 01:38:13,240
- I'm back. I'm back. - It's too late.

910
01:38:13,310 --> 01:38:15,570
- I'm pulling out. - No,it's not. We're good.

911
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:17,270
Get ready to go.

912
01:38:18,980 --> 01:38:20,410
On my mark.

913
01:38:24,650 --> 01:38:25,780
Go,go,go.

914
01:38:40,230 --> 01:38:42,200
What the hell's wrong with these machines?

915
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:57,850
Hey,stop banging on it. Check the connection.

916
01:39:19,140 --> 01:39:22,470
- You see something? - I don't know.

917
01:39:41,330 --> 01:39:43,760
Call them. Call Ironclad.

918
01:39:44,500 --> 01:39:47,560
- And look like idiots? - I don't care. Call them.

919
01:40:43,220 --> 01:40:45,920
Maybe it's some of the equipment down in the basement.

920
01:40:48,260 --> 01:40:50,250
Okay. Thanks.

921
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,590
Someone will be here in a few minutes.

922
01:41:41,080 --> 01:41:43,110
Where are you,kid?

923
01:43:29,320 --> 01:43:32,310
Make a move,make a sound,and you are dead.

924
01:43:32,390 --> 01:43:34,420
Do you understand me?

925
01:43:36,360 --> 01:43:37,920
Turn around.

926
01:43:42,500 --> 01:43:43,990
Be quiet.

927
01:43:58,450 --> 01:44:00,440
I wish you had not come down here,man.

928
01:44:04,260 --> 01:44:08,390
Get over there. Turn around. Come on. Let's go. Turn around.

929
01:44:08,460 --> 01:44:12,360
Walk over there. Open the door.

930
01:44:12,430 --> 01:44:14,460
Open it.

931
01:44:14,530 --> 01:44:16,430
Get inside.

932
01:44:18,500 --> 01:44:20,440
Look at me.

933
01:44:20,510 --> 01:44:22,940
You're a good man. I don't want to hurt you.

934
01:44:23,010 --> 01:44:25,910
But if you start making noise or try to open that door,I will do it.

935
01:44:25,980 --> 01:44:27,540
Do you understand me?

936
01:44:29,880 --> 01:44:32,980
Stay in there and be quiet. Everything will be fine.

937
01:45:36,380 --> 01:45:38,210
I don't wanna wait.

938
01:45:38,280 --> 01:45:41,010
I want you and Tommy to go into the basement now.

939
01:45:41,090 --> 01:45:43,420
Come on,Andre. I'm watching this.

940
01:45:43,490 --> 01:45:45,290
Laurent,please.

941
01:45:47,260 --> 01:45:50,560
Tommy,get Philippe. We're gonna be checking out the basement again.

942
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:36,870
Hold it right there!

943
01:46:36,940 --> 01:46:39,170
- Are you crazy? - Take it off and put it down.

944
01:46:39,280 --> 01:46:43,210
- Aw,come on. - Take it off and put it down now!

945
01:46:43,320 --> 01:46:46,720
- Don't do this. - Take it off and put it down!

946
01:46:46,790 --> 01:46:48,750
- Please,don't... - Don't fuckin' argue with me.

947
01:46:48,820 --> 01:46:51,520
Take it off and put it down.

948
01:46:51,590 --> 01:46:53,180
I can't. I can't.

949
01:46:54,530 --> 01:46:57,690
I'll put the next one in your knee. I don't have time to fuck around.

950
01:46:57,760 --> 01:47:01,030
We can work out the details later. I am leaving with that scepter.

951
01:47:02,370 --> 01:47:06,430
Now,take it off and hand it over right now!

952
01:47:13,650 --> 01:47:17,210
Put it down. Slowly.

953
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:20,210
Now,step back. Back up.

954
01:47:29,130 --> 01:47:31,120
- Take off your mask. - What?

955
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:32,690
Take it off!

956
01:47:34,330 --> 01:47:37,700
I don't have time to play games. Take it off.

957
01:47:49,980 --> 01:47:51,920
Throw it over there.

958
01:47:54,090 --> 01:47:56,250
Step in the middle.

959
01:47:56,360 --> 01:47:58,720
Step in the middle. That's right.

960
01:48:02,360 --> 01:48:06,420
We wouldn't be here if you'd thrown
me some respect at the beginning.

961
01:48:06,500 --> 01:48:08,470
- Just a little bit.
- This is a stupid move.

962
01:48:08,530 --> 01:48:10,060
- It is? Why?
- We all come out ahead.

963
01:48:10,140 --> 01:48:12,630
What are you doing?
Just go up there and finish...

964
01:48:12,710 --> 01:48:14,230
It's a long shot.I should play it tight.

965
01:48:14,340 --> 01:48:16,240
You know what I think of
your bullshit advice?

966
01:48:16,340 --> 01:48:19,470
I think that's you trying to
talk me into taking a sucker's share...

967
01:48:19,550 --> 01:48:22,810
on a score that I set up from the beginning!

968
01:48:24,280 --> 01:48:28,310
You think I'm stupid,that I don't
see what you and Max are doing?

969
01:48:29,990 --> 01:48:33,690
I mean,what is he giving you?
Five,six million?

970
01:48:33,760 --> 01:48:36,160
Tell me that's not true.

971
01:48:36,230 --> 01:48:38,490
See,that doesn't work for me.

972
01:48:40,070 --> 01:48:44,930
I appreciate your help,but
you should've made me a partner.

973
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,030
Now I gotta take a shot.

974
01:48:52,780 --> 01:48:56,270
Just sit tight.Just sit tight.
Everything will be fine.

975
01:49:00,150 --> 01:49:03,780
Now you got a choice.
You can either head for that tunnel...

976
01:49:03,860 --> 01:49:05,760
or smile for that camera.

977
01:49:14,300 --> 01:49:15,860
Andre,what's happening?

978
01:49:15,930 --> 01:49:17,600
Get down! Go to the basement!

979
01:49:17,670 --> 01:49:20,230
We're being robbed! We're being robbed!

980
01:49:25,210 --> 01:49:28,240
Henri,quick! Go outside!
Wait for the police!

981
01:49:35,820 --> 01:49:37,580
Let's go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

982
01:50:08,950 --> 01:50:11,010
Over here! Over here!

983
01:50:15,190 --> 01:50:19,460
- He's in the tunnel! - Where is he?

984
01:50:21,830 --> 01:50:23,230
Find him!

985
01:50:40,120 --> 01:50:42,280
- Back there! - Okay!

986
01:50:42,350 --> 01:50:44,350
Come on! Come on! Come on!

987
01:51:28,330 --> 01:51:31,060
- Andre! - Oh,shit.

988
01:51:31,140 --> 01:51:33,230
- Andre,is there a fire? - It's okay.

989
01:51:37,140 --> 01:51:39,080
- Where's Danny? - Just get out!

990
01:51:39,140 --> 01:51:41,580
- Okay. - Just wait outside.

991
01:51:45,080 --> 01:51:48,540
- Just wait outside! - Okay,bye-bye.

992
01:51:51,690 --> 01:51:53,990
Wait,Brian,wait!

993
01:51:54,060 --> 01:51:55,860
Get back,Brian!

994
01:51:58,360 --> 01:52:01,130
It's Brian! It's Brian!

995
01:52:01,200 --> 01:52:05,030
- Have you seen Brian? - He's okay! He's outside!

996
01:52:05,100 --> 01:52:07,300
No! My God,it's him!

997
01:52:09,370 --> 01:52:12,140
It's okay now. It's okay.

998
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:47,860
Attention. The bus to Albany,New York leaves in five...

999
01:54:49,870 --> 01:54:50,860
Yeah?

1000
01:54:50,940 --> 01:54:53,200
- Hey,did you make it? - Fuck you.

1001
01:54:54,610 --> 01:54:56,540
Come on. I'm just checking to make sure you got out okay.

1002
01:54:56,610 --> 01:54:58,580
I knew you'd give 'em the slip.

1003
01:54:59,810 --> 01:55:01,780
I'm almost home,too,here,by the way.

1004
01:55:01,850 --> 01:55:03,610
Oh,you are,huh? You sure about that?

1005
01:55:03,680 --> 01:55:07,170
Look,whatever you're thinking about,just forget it,okay?

1006
01:55:07,250 --> 01:55:09,220
This is over now and you just gotta deal with it.

1007
01:55:09,290 --> 01:55:12,850
It's not over yet 'cause you don't know where you're going,and I do.

1008
01:55:12,890 --> 01:55:14,860
- You don't know shit! - You know where you're going?

1009
01:55:14,890 --> 01:55:19,490
I'm five minutes from being gone. You can't imagine where I'm going.

1010
01:55:19,560 --> 01:55:22,330
- You got nothin'. - You know what I got.

1011
01:55:22,400 --> 01:55:24,560
You just can't deal with the fact that I beat you.

1012
01:55:24,640 --> 01:55:28,770
Oh,yeah? What have you got? Huh? What have you got?

1013
01:55:28,840 --> 01:55:30,870
You know what I've got.

1014
01:55:59,740 --> 01:56:01,000
Let me ask you something.

1015
01:56:01,070 --> 01:56:04,530
When did you start thinking you were better than me,huh?

1016
01:56:04,610 --> 01:56:05,770
You still there,ace?

1017
01:56:07,510 --> 01:56:10,500
Okay. Nicely done.

1018
01:56:10,580 --> 01:56:13,240
Nicely done. Now let's talk about this.

1019
01:56:13,320 --> 01:56:15,680
Okay,let's see. How'd you put it? "Deal with it. It's over."

1020
01:56:15,750 --> 01:56:18,880
No,I don't think so.You want me to list the ways I can burn you?

1021
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:22,120
We either work this out right now,
or I will take you down.

1022
01:56:22,190 --> 01:56:25,630
Oh,yeah? How? My shop,
my tools,they're gone.

1023
01:56:25,700 --> 01:56:28,460
Me,my friend,I'm just a taxpaying
jazz club owner.

1024
01:56:28,530 --> 01:56:31,530
You? Every cop in the city's
looking for you right about now.

1025
01:56:32,270 --> 01:56:35,570
So if I were you,I'd quit
makin'threats and hit the road.

1026
01:56:39,540 --> 01:56:41,570
Nice workin' with you,ace.

1027
01:56:41,650 --> 01:56:43,940
Okay,bye-bye.

1028
01:57:16,720 --> 01:57:19,580
Montreal was stunned by the
daring predawn robbery...

1029
01:57:19,650 --> 01:57:22,520
of the old city's historic customshouse.

1030
01:57:22,590 --> 01:57:26,150
A priceless scepter was stolen.
A senior night janitor...

1031
01:57:26,220 --> 01:57:28,160
identified this man...

1032
01:57:28,230 --> 01:57:30,160
as the prime suspect in the burglary.

1033
01:57:30,230 --> 01:57:33,460
He was spotted leaving the scene
moments after the robbery...

1034
01:57:33,530 --> 01:57:35,970
and is now the focus of a massive manhunt.

1035
01:57:36,030 --> 01:57:39,800
A second suspect vanished from the scene without a trace.

1036
01:57:39,840 --> 01:57:43,040
Police have no solid leads.
