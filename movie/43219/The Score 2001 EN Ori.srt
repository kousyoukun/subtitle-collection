1
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:44,167
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

2
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:09,419
Get down, get down,
let me hear you scream!

3
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,834
Wait, wait. Wait.

4
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,142
- Wait.
- What?

5
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:49,311
This.

6
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,272
Later.

7
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,192
I want a smoke.

8
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,404
I want a smoke.

9
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,742
Fine. Smoke.

10
00:04:07,246 --> 00:04:09,039
Smoke all night.

11
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:17,191
Be still. Do not turn around.

12
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:20,569
Do not turn around, you will not be hurt.

13
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:44,477
Bonjour, Nick.

14
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,361
Albert!

15
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:36,903
Nick.

16
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,448
Boss. Hi.

17
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:42,951
- Jean-Claude.
- So, the trip was good?

18
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,372
So how we doing?

19
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:49,291
Great. We have many reservation
for tonight.

20
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:51,377
Good. How many covers
did we have last night?

21
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:53,379
- Over 150.
- Good.

22
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,630
Bar was steady.

23
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:56,798
- How was the music?
- Oh, great band.

24
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,092
Good. Good.

25
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:02,888
Albert?

26
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,474
Scotch on the rocks, please,
a little water.

27
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:06,892
Yeah, sure.

28
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:29,998
Max.

29
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,501
Back from Bermuda.

30
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,295
Did you have a good trip?

31
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:38,632
Well, not as interesting as yours,
I'm sure.

32
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:42,261
My God, let me get a look at you.

33
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:46,181
You know you look like shit?
What's your secret?

34
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:48,517
Jean-Claude, you want to set up
number two for us?

35
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,018
Yeah, sure.

36
00:12:57,151 --> 00:13:00,195
Just give us a little room, guys.
Thank you.

37
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:07,369
Et voilà.
How about something in a few minutes?

38
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,292
Bermuda.

39
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:20,299
Oh, God, well...

40
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,636
It was pretty tight out there.

41
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:26,805
That's good. It's gonna keep you sharp.

42
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:31,810
I got a minor development.
We lost the buyer.

43
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,895
Lost? What do you mean, lost?

44
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,189
Well, she's in a brass casket

45
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,693
six feet under ground.
Never to be heard from again.

46
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,988
Well, I fronted 20,000 in expenses.

47
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,699
Now I'm due that, plus 250 for my end.

48
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,743
You don't think I'm not going to
take care of you?

49
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:49,911
I'm not going to cover your expenses
and all that?

50
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,413
It's not about covering my expenses.

51
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,499
I want the money.
We got to find another buyer.

52
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,917
Of course.
But, Jesus Christ, shit happens.

53
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,754
This thing's going to drag out.
You've got to be patient.

54
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:02,007
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
How about this?

55
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:07,763
Four big ones in your hand.
$4 million in your mitt.

56
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,974
-4 million?
- More than you ever even dreamed of.

57
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,769
More than we ever, ever did together.

58
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,271
4 million. What are you into?

59
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:19,566
Well, I spotted this item
which was really exceptional.

60
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:23,111
It was European antiquity, elegant.

61
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:26,490
And it was in the hands
of this real dumb prick

62
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:29,117
that didn't know what he had.

63
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:33,288
And unfortunately
it's become detained in transit a little.

64
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,336
You don't want to know where?

65
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:41,129
It depends.

66
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,506
Depends on what?

67
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:44,508
It depends on what
you're going to tell me.

68
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:48,136
Okay. It's in the
Montreal Customs House.

69
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,599
No. Oh, no.

70
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,808
- No way.
- Yeah.

71
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,059
Sorry. Forget it.

72
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,227
Wait, wait a minute.

73
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:59,690
I got a guy. I got a guy inside.
He gives you the whole layout.

74
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:02,484
Handles security,
every bump, everything...

75
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:05,320
You know, you used to tell me,
"Steal outside the country,

76
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,906
"steal in the States, steal in Europe,

77
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,575
"but Montreal, live in Montreal. "

78
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:12,578
I said a lot of dumb things in my day,
didn't I?

79
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,747
- Yeah, but that's...
- Right.

80
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:19,293
Let's just find another buyer for this,
okay? I got to open the place.

81
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:22,713
Okay, but I'm not finished
talking about this.

82
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:25,048
Jean-Claude, Albert. Come on.

83
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,593
You're making a large error here,
my friend.

84
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:35,810
Not bad.

85
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:51,325
- Yeah?
- I just landed. I got the delivery.

86
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,516
You got the bag?

87
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:17,476
Yeah, right here.

88
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:18,686
Where's Johnny?

89
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:21,939
He got it in Istanbul.
Right through the neck.

90
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,440
Jesus, he was a good kid.

91
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:25,317
Yeah, good and dead.

92
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:28,570
So you wanna talk
or you wanna see what I got?

93
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:30,948
How can I be sure you're okay?

94
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:34,159
I suppose I could fuck you.

95
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,286
That would work.

96
00:16:56,975 --> 00:16:59,226
Hey, you okay?

97
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,437
Yeah, great.

98
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,819
How was your trip?

99
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:12,030
I don't know. Cities.

100
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:17,452
They are all starting to look the same.
They really are.

101
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:27,379
And the pasta in Rome
is not as good as yours.

102
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:34,386
And the ass-pinchers. They used to look
so charmingly European.

103
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,221
Not as good as me?

104
00:17:40,936 --> 00:17:42,310
Common.

105
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:45,814
You know it really must be
what it is about you I like,

106
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:48,859
because you most definitely
are not common.

107
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:57,492
- What if I were?
- What if you were what?

108
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:00,829
A little more common, you know,
and around more.

109
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:02,790
How much more?

110
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,917
Like all the time more.

111
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:07,168
And I was just a jazz club owner
and not that other thing.

112
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,588
How would you feel about that?

113
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:13,508
Hey, are you saying what I think
you're saying?

114
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,011
I think that's what I'm saying.

115
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:24,019
Hey, baby, now you know I've never
asked you to change anything for me?

116
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,186
You know that, right?

117
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:29,441
I know that. I'm just asking you.
How would you feel about that?

118
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:37,365
I don't know.

119
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:43,497
I suppose I'd have to give it
some serious thought.

120
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:49,045
Then you better start giving it
some serious thought.

121
00:18:57,721 --> 00:19:00,890
Thank you.
Will I see you when I see you?

122
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:02,975
See you when I see you.

123
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:45,225
Excuse me, can you help me please?

124
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:48,395
Can you help me?

125
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,107
- Place Norman?
- Yes. Yes.

126
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:53,442
You go to the corner, you make a right,
you go two blocks.

127
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:56,278
- Two.
- Two blocks. Then a left for one block.

128
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:58,238
- Again, please.
- Two blocks on the corner,

129
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:00,950
two blocks this way,
one block that way, to the left,

130
00:20:00,951 --> 00:20:02,118
and you're right there.

131
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:03,285
- Okay, thank you.
- Okay.

132
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:04,870
Thank you, Nick.

133
00:20:06,581 --> 00:20:08,791
What? What'd you say?

134
00:20:09,126 --> 00:20:11,376
I said, "Thank you, Nick. "

135
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:17,716
I'm Max's guy in the Customs House.
We should talk.

136
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,930
Okay, bye-bye. Thank you.
Thank you, bye.

137
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:31,147
Where's Max?

138
00:20:31,148 --> 00:20:33,107
He's in the sunroom.

139
00:20:36,153 --> 00:20:38,570
- Max.
- Nicolai, Nicolai.

140
00:20:39,322 --> 00:20:41,073
Have you lost your fucking mind?

141
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,408
- My mind?
- Yeah.

142
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:44,827
Yes, years ago. Why?

143
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:46,787
Well, what did you tell him?
What did you tell this kid?

144
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:48,246
- What did I tell who?
- Your guy,

145
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,832
your inside guy with the retard act.

146
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:53,085
He was in front of my house.
He knew who I was.

147
00:20:53,837 --> 00:20:57,173
Wait a minute. He must've followed me
to the club and made you from there.

148
00:20:57,174 --> 00:20:59,175
You tell him the next time he pulls
a fucking stunt like that

149
00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:00,968
he's going to wind up in the hospital.

150
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:04,471
Wait a minute, you think I'm going
to set you up with a jerk-off heister?

151
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:07,641
You got to admit that this kid did
a pretty good dog and pony show.

152
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:09,101
Are you crazy?
I don't give a shit who he is.

153
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:11,436
You don't expose me like that.
You got to know better.

154
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,189
He's got it all pre-wired, Nicky.

155
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,691
- You go in and you turn the key...
- I told you I'm not interested.

156
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:18,110
You're never going to get another
chance at a score like this...

157
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:19,195
What's the matter with you?

158
00:21:19,196 --> 00:21:20,362
Why are you pushing this?

159
00:21:20,363 --> 00:21:23,199
Four million balls. How many times
do I have to fucking tell you?

160
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,368
He's pushing it
because we're running out of time.

161
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:28,620
I'm just saying if I'm going to work
with a partner on this,

162
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:30,622
we got to start putting
our heads together right away.

163
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:33,375
- What are you doing in my house?
- Take it easy. All I'm saying is...

164
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:35,961
Who the fuck is this kid?
What the fuck do you know?

165
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:37,629
I'm the guy who's been on this
for three weeks, okay?

166
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,173
- I got to know if you're the guy...
- Wait, but, Nick.

167
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:40,340
...that Max says you are.

168
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:42,051
- I got to go. I got to go.
- Look, all I'm saying...

169
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:45,679
- Nick, Nick, wait. Nicky!
- Hey!

170
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:49,683
I didn't come 500 miles just to...
Jack Teller, nice to meet you, too.

171
00:21:49,684 --> 00:21:51,060
What the fuck?

172
00:21:51,061 --> 00:21:53,353
You're not smart enough
to know where your dick is.

173
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:55,689
We decided that
you were gonna sit tight

174
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:58,067
- until I called you. Is that correct?
- Yeah, I... Okay, okay.

175
00:21:58,068 --> 00:21:59,235
I thought I could help you sell him on it.

176
00:21:59,236 --> 00:22:00,569
I thought you said he was already in.

177
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:03,739
Don't be so fucking creative. Just get
the fuck out of my house, will you?

178
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:08,077
You know what? When you guys get
your shit together, give me a call, okay?

179
00:22:08,078 --> 00:22:09,661
Unbelievable.

180
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:16,288
Jesus!

181
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:19,833
Oh, God. Jesus, take it easy.

182
00:24:21,294 --> 00:24:22,878
Listen close.

183
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:25,214
Leave town tonight, don't come back.

184
00:24:25,215 --> 00:24:28,217
I see you again,
I break your fucking knees.

185
00:24:28,218 --> 00:24:30,177
I see you around Nick, I'll kill you.

186
00:24:30,178 --> 00:24:32,721
It's a dangerous fucking game
you're playing here.

187
00:24:32,722 --> 00:24:34,348
Are we clear?

188
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:42,564
Yeah, we're clear.

189
00:25:23,398 --> 00:25:24,898
How'd it go?

190
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,984
Not as planned.

191
00:25:27,944 --> 00:25:29,111
What do you want?

192
00:25:29,112 --> 00:25:32,823
I'll take some fucking respect from you
for starters. How about that?

193
00:25:32,824 --> 00:25:36,660
I mean, what... What are you thinking?
I'm on a job here.

194
00:25:37,162 --> 00:25:40,164
Now if you just don't want to come in
on it, that's fine, say no.

195
00:25:40,165 --> 00:25:43,000
But don't send some fucking third-rate
rent-a-thug to brush me off.

196
00:25:43,001 --> 00:25:45,627
You can do it like a professional.

197
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:48,672
Hello?

198
00:25:49,924 --> 00:25:53,802
Yeah. Okay, he's right here.

199
00:25:54,304 --> 00:25:56,638
Don't worry.
Just go home. I'll call you later.

200
00:25:56,639 --> 00:25:58,598
All right, all right, it's okay.

201
00:26:01,436 --> 00:26:03,812
Look, I didn't come here
to cause any trouble, all right?

202
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:05,189
I didn't.

203
00:26:06,316 --> 00:26:09,943
I mean, coming up to you on the street
like that, that was a stupid move.

204
00:26:09,944 --> 00:26:12,821
Sorry. Why don't we just call it even?

205
00:26:13,114 --> 00:26:15,032
I just want to say one thing to you.
Then I'll go away.

206
00:26:15,033 --> 00:26:19,036
We don't have to bother each other
anymore if you don't want.

207
00:26:20,497 --> 00:26:23,790
I have been casing this place
for a couple weeks now.

208
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:27,503
It's a little bit complicated,
but this is a very doable job.

209
00:26:27,504 --> 00:26:32,508
I can handle the system in there,
if someone else can break into this box.

210
00:26:32,509 --> 00:26:34,676
Look, I don't know you,
you don't know me.

211
00:26:34,677 --> 00:26:36,470
I know that's not the best way
to do things,

212
00:26:36,471 --> 00:26:41,141
but I am very good at what I do, okay.
And I take it very, very seriously.

213
00:26:41,476 --> 00:26:43,894
You can check it out with Max.

214
00:26:43,895 --> 00:26:46,855
Now, if you are the guy
that he says you are,

215
00:26:46,856 --> 00:26:49,733
then we should check this out.

216
00:26:49,734 --> 00:26:52,819
Just take a look at it.
That's all I'm saying.

217
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:56,656
'Cause this is a very big payoff
for very acceptable risks.

218
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:06,833
Just take a look at it.
Go look for yourself.

219
00:27:09,712 --> 00:27:13,382
I like your place. You got good taste.

220
00:28:53,816 --> 00:28:56,610
Oh, Jesus, it's nice and dark in here.

221
00:28:56,611 --> 00:28:58,153
Fucking everything.

222
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:00,239
Hey, Nick.

223
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:01,823
Max.

224
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:06,412
Jesus, why don't you
jump for some lights in this place?

225
00:29:06,413 --> 00:29:10,916
Every time I come in here,
it's like hide-and-go-seek.

226
00:29:10,917 --> 00:29:12,459
How are you?

227
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:29,768
Now, you got to tell me the magic word.

228
00:29:31,354 --> 00:29:33,272
All right, I'm gonna do it.

229
00:29:33,273 --> 00:29:37,109
Good, good, Jesus, sweetheart.
You're a sweetheart.

230
00:29:37,611 --> 00:29:39,861
Bravo. You're making sense.

231
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:44,824
But because of the risk involved,
my end's got to be 6 million.

232
00:29:47,454 --> 00:29:51,998
Operator, I got a nut down here
that just said 6 million.

233
00:29:52,709 --> 00:29:55,835
No, send paramedics, I think.
You all right?

234
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:57,003
I'm fine.

235
00:29:57,004 --> 00:30:00,382
Six fucking million dollars.
What happened to four?

236
00:30:00,383 --> 00:30:03,510
I'm doing it in my backyard.
I'm not going to go like that. I'm sorry.

237
00:30:03,511 --> 00:30:05,554
If you want me to do this,
you got to pay me what's right.

238
00:30:05,555 --> 00:30:06,722
It's got to be that way.

239
00:30:06,723 --> 00:30:08,724
I always pay you what's right.

240
00:30:08,725 --> 00:30:10,058
You always think
you pay me what's right.

241
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:12,018
I always know what you pay me.

242
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:15,230
It's not always right. I need this for this.

243
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:19,859
I like your style.
Yeah, well, okay, I understand.

244
00:30:21,362 --> 00:30:24,657
It's what I have to do.
I want to pay off the club, the mortgage.

245
00:30:24,658 --> 00:30:26,575
I want to own this place free and clear.

246
00:30:26,576 --> 00:30:29,244
I want it to be mine.
I live the way I want.

247
00:30:29,245 --> 00:30:30,788
Because after this, no more jobs.

248
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:33,957
This is the last one I'm doing.
I'm quitting for good.

249
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:36,335
How many times you told me that
in 25 years?

250
00:30:36,336 --> 00:30:39,838
I mean, I'm going to believe that
when the pigs eat my brother, right?

251
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:42,132
I'm done. I'm done, no more.

252
00:30:44,469 --> 00:30:47,053
Well, okay. Hope she's worth it.

253
00:30:52,226 --> 00:30:53,727
It's numbnuts.

254
00:30:57,023 --> 00:31:00,233
Nice house, nice club.
You must be really good.

255
00:31:03,029 --> 00:31:07,533
I don't want to have to do this,
but raise your arms. Raise your arms.

256
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:09,535
Be my guest.

257
00:31:09,536 --> 00:31:10,828
He's all right.

258
00:31:14,207 --> 00:31:15,416
Okay?

259
00:31:22,507 --> 00:31:25,676
Is this a social call?
What are we doing here?

260
00:31:27,846 --> 00:31:29,304
I will explore this with you,

261
00:31:29,305 --> 00:31:32,307
but I run this operation
down to the smallest detail.

262
00:31:32,308 --> 00:31:36,353
If you have a problem with that,
we can all go home right now.

263
00:31:36,354 --> 00:31:38,731
Is there a problem with that?

264
00:31:39,232 --> 00:31:40,899
That's fine.

265
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:44,152
You will tell me everything you know.
Then I will design the plan.

266
00:31:44,153 --> 00:31:48,115
If I smell something about the job or you
that I don't like, I walk away.

267
00:31:48,116 --> 00:31:51,118
If I think for one second
you're not living up to your end of it

268
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:54,830
or if you hold out on me in any way,
I walk. Understood?

269
00:31:54,831 --> 00:31:57,916
That's fine.
Tell me what you want to know.

270
00:31:59,461 --> 00:32:01,837
First of all, what are we looking for?

271
00:32:01,838 --> 00:32:03,589
You know what a scepter is?

272
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:06,174
It's something that a king holds.

273
00:32:06,509 --> 00:32:11,430
Right there.
It was made in 1661 in France

274
00:32:11,431 --> 00:32:14,933
for a special coronation for a girl queen.

275
00:32:16,686 --> 00:32:19,438
- It's priceless.
- Not to us, it's not.

276
00:32:19,898 --> 00:32:22,399
What can you give me
on its specific location?

277
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,859
I can give you the whole building, okay.

278
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:28,280
I got floor plans. I've been clocking the
security patterns for over three weeks.

279
00:32:28,281 --> 00:32:30,574
All right, paint me a picture.

280
00:32:31,075 --> 00:32:32,284
Okay.

281
00:32:32,285 --> 00:32:36,538
He fixed me up with the job. I mean,
not me, but Brian, the guy on the street.

282
00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:37,832
Yeah, I remember him.

283
00:32:37,833 --> 00:32:39,958
Is he traceable?
Phone number, address, that stuff?

284
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:42,920
No, no, no. It's totally tight.
The guy is a charity case, a favor.

285
00:32:42,921 --> 00:32:45,213
I mean the guy truly
doesn't even exist on paper.

286
00:32:45,214 --> 00:32:48,509
He just shows up.
He's Assistant Janitor.

287
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:49,885
Midnight to 8:00 a. m.

288
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:56,725
The security's pretty basic.

289
00:32:56,726 --> 00:32:58,894
I mean, at night
they just lock the whole place down.

290
00:32:58,895 --> 00:33:00,145
They bar the ground floor windows.

291
00:33:00,146 --> 00:33:01,480
You can only enter in
through one place,

292
00:33:01,481 --> 00:33:03,565
out by the truck court.

293
00:33:06,444 --> 00:33:09,363
Thank you, Albert. Thank you.

294
00:33:09,364 --> 00:33:11,198
Manpower's very light.
They got one guy

295
00:33:11,199 --> 00:33:14,993
sitting in a booth outside
just keeping an eye on things.

296
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:20,332
On the inside everyone's got to come in
through a standard metal detector.

297
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:24,294
It's a little tricky bringing things through,
but I think I've got that figured out.

298
00:33:24,295 --> 00:33:27,047
All the guards know me now,
so no one really looks too close.

299
00:33:27,048 --> 00:33:29,591
- Okay, thank you.
- All right.

300
00:33:29,592 --> 00:33:32,010
Once I'm inside
I can go anywhere I want.

301
00:33:32,011 --> 00:33:33,721
Hey, Laurent.

302
00:33:33,722 --> 00:33:37,307
Everything gets run from this one little
central command console.

303
00:33:37,308 --> 00:33:41,102
They've got fixed video systems
in the elevators and in the hallways.

304
00:33:41,103 --> 00:33:44,565
They've got a couple of magnetic doors,
but it's all very basic.

305
00:33:44,566 --> 00:33:48,235
Lots of overtime. Not so much now.

306
00:33:48,236 --> 00:33:52,781
Now, the head janitor's this old guy,
Danny. He loves Brian, loves him.

307
00:33:52,782 --> 00:33:55,283
I mean, I've got this guy
completely wrapped around my finger.

308
00:33:55,284 --> 00:33:57,912
He'd do anything for me.

309
00:33:57,913 --> 00:33:59,914
Most of the time
he's got me working with him.

310
00:33:59,915 --> 00:34:01,749
Kind of low-level shit. Just helping out.

311
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:05,293
But I can get away from him plenty.
I got all kinds of reasons.

312
00:34:05,294 --> 00:34:08,881
I've sketched half the place already.
I've copied a lot of keys.

313
00:34:08,882 --> 00:34:11,884
I can get you access
to basically any room in the place.

314
00:34:11,885 --> 00:34:13,427
Where's the scepter?

315
00:34:13,428 --> 00:34:16,054
Well, see, that's the kink.

316
00:34:16,514 --> 00:34:21,226
Get this. It was arranged to be
brought into the country

317
00:34:21,227 --> 00:34:25,188
inside the leg of an antique piano.

318
00:34:25,189 --> 00:34:28,901
It was so simple.
Then they impounded it.

319
00:34:28,902 --> 00:34:32,446
I mean, can you guess why?
Fucking bugs.

320
00:34:34,115 --> 00:34:37,659
I mean, the whole shipment was
contaminated with termites.

321
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:40,704
Asian Longhorn Beetles.

322
00:34:40,705 --> 00:34:42,748
We got fucked by bugs.

323
00:34:45,209 --> 00:34:46,794
These things burrow into the wood,

324
00:34:46,795 --> 00:34:48,503
so they were in the crates
of most of the shipments.

325
00:34:48,504 --> 00:34:51,089
So they took the goods out
and delivered most of them.

326
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:54,009
But the piano's made of wood, too,
so they impounded it.

327
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:56,511
They took the whole thing,
they put it in quarantine

328
00:34:56,512 --> 00:34:59,431
in a medium security, 3rd floor lockup.

329
00:34:59,432 --> 00:35:00,682
They're really scared of these things.

330
00:35:00,683 --> 00:35:03,644
And they can't send them
back to France.

331
00:35:05,021 --> 00:35:07,648
So they decide to burn everything.

332
00:35:16,198 --> 00:35:20,702
Now, I'll tell you. I don't know which
one of the fucking legs this thing is in.

333
00:35:20,703 --> 00:35:22,621
But half of me was tempted
to just grab them all

334
00:35:22,622 --> 00:35:23,998
and make a break for it right there.

335
00:35:23,999 --> 00:35:27,501
And I don't know if this thing's
going to melt or what.

336
00:35:28,753 --> 00:35:30,629
I mean, I was dying.

337
00:35:34,175 --> 00:35:36,969
So I had to improvise a little bit.

338
00:35:39,806 --> 00:35:43,392
Laurent! Laurent!
I saw something in fire.

339
00:35:43,393 --> 00:35:44,935
It's burning, son. It's just burning.

340
00:35:44,936 --> 00:35:51,149
Look, look, look. I saw something
in the piano. In the piano, I saw. Look.

341
00:35:51,943 --> 00:35:54,070
I just... I saw something.

342
00:36:10,336 --> 00:36:11,712
So everybody's freaking out.

343
00:36:11,713 --> 00:36:13,923
Nobody knows what this is
or what to do with it.

344
00:36:13,924 --> 00:36:15,883
They don't see this kind of excitement
down there.

345
00:36:15,884 --> 00:36:18,052
So they call some supervisor.
They get him out of bed.

346
00:36:18,053 --> 00:36:20,220
He comes down.
He takes one look at this thing,

347
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:23,140
he doesn't know what the hell it is,
but he knows it's worth a lot.

348
00:36:23,141 --> 00:36:25,225
So he tells them,
until they can sort it out,

349
00:36:25,226 --> 00:36:28,270
put it in a box, put it in the basement.
And that's what they do.

350
00:36:28,271 --> 00:36:30,480
- Don't worry. Don't worry.
- It's no toy.

351
00:36:30,481 --> 00:36:32,983
- I want to see, Danny. Can I see?
- Don't... No, no, no, no.

352
00:36:33,526 --> 00:36:36,946
- Come on, let's go now.
- Okay, bye-bye. Bye.

353
00:36:53,046 --> 00:36:54,671
The basement in the Customs House

354
00:36:54,672 --> 00:36:56,799
is the most secure lockup
in eastern Canada.

355
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,301
It was built as a bomb shelter
during the Cold War.

356
00:36:59,302 --> 00:37:01,011
They put all their important stuff in here.

357
00:37:01,012 --> 00:37:04,765
State's evidence, narcotics,
confiscated weapons.

358
00:37:04,766 --> 00:37:07,726
That scepter is in the safe
somewhere in this room.

359
00:37:07,727 --> 00:37:09,853
But the thing is, there's no cameras.

360
00:37:09,854 --> 00:37:12,648
If there was, I would've seen an angle
on the video monitors.

361
00:37:12,649 --> 00:37:17,027
So if we can put you inside that room
you can work on it all night.

362
00:37:18,404 --> 00:37:19,822
Well, we're going to need
pictures of the safe

363
00:37:19,823 --> 00:37:21,991
or a model number from their files.

364
00:37:21,992 --> 00:37:23,575
Then we're going to need plans,

365
00:37:23,576 --> 00:37:26,954
infrastructure maps,
blueprints, schematics,

366
00:37:26,955 --> 00:37:28,080
anything we can get our hands on.

367
00:37:28,081 --> 00:37:30,749
Yeah. Yeah. That's all I got for now,
but give me two days.

368
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:34,711
Then we just got to find a way
to get into that basement.

369
00:38:15,336 --> 00:38:17,796
You going to let it go or are we gonna
drive around pissed all night?

370
00:38:17,797 --> 00:38:19,256
Why don't you kiss my ass?

371
00:38:44,323 --> 00:38:46,033
Okay, we're about set up here.
You all ready?

372
00:38:46,034 --> 00:38:47,409
Hold on.

373
00:39:04,385 --> 00:39:07,763
- Want to give me the mark?
- Not yet, not yet.

374
00:39:20,443 --> 00:39:21,818
How you doing?

375
00:39:21,819 --> 00:39:24,280
Stay off the air until I call.

376
00:39:48,429 --> 00:39:52,933
Three-three, two-six,
two-nine, three-two.

377
00:39:53,352 --> 00:39:58,438
I repeat. 33-26, 29-32.

378
00:39:58,731 --> 00:40:03,068
Copy that, 33-26, 29-32.

379
00:40:06,572 --> 00:40:11,243
Now make a right,
proceed east about 20 yards,

380
00:40:11,244 --> 00:40:13,912
you should see the next opening.

381
00:40:21,546 --> 00:40:24,131
I'm at a wall here. A cinder block wall.

382
00:40:24,132 --> 00:40:26,091
Where you told me that I have to go.

383
00:40:26,092 --> 00:40:28,927
You sure about that?
It shows a straight shot on here.

384
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:31,138
It's not my imagination.
I'm right here in front of it.

385
00:40:31,139 --> 00:40:34,474
You want to come down here
and see for yourself?

386
00:40:34,934 --> 00:40:37,602
Right. Okay, okay. Hold on.

387
00:40:40,148 --> 00:40:42,774
All right, just give me a second.

388
00:40:44,652 --> 00:40:47,821
- Can you read me?
- Okay, make a left, go about 20 feet.

389
00:40:47,822 --> 00:40:49,447
You should run into a parallel tunnel.

390
00:40:49,448 --> 00:40:52,617
Make a right,
you'll be right back on course.

391
00:40:55,454 --> 00:40:58,456
Take that tunnel
about 150 yards due west.

392
00:40:58,457 --> 00:41:00,834
You'll reach a "T" junction.
Tell me when you're there.

393
00:41:00,835 --> 00:41:03,921
About 300 yards,
came to the end, made a right.

394
00:41:03,922 --> 00:41:06,840
Okay, head northwest... Northeast.
Check that, northeast.

395
00:41:06,841 --> 00:41:09,009
Wait one second, hold on.

396
00:41:09,677 --> 00:41:11,095
You with me?

397
00:41:11,096 --> 00:41:13,972
Going west, going west.
All right, I'm going west on the circle.

398
00:41:13,973 --> 00:41:17,435
Make a right, go 40 yards east.

399
00:41:17,436 --> 00:41:21,563
Then turn, 'cause we're gonna
make a left, left turn, go about...

400
00:41:21,564 --> 00:41:25,650
Make a right, head back northeast,
tunnel will be 500 yards to go.

401
00:41:32,658 --> 00:41:36,787
Okay, straight ahead 20 feet and
you should be dead under the room.

402
00:41:36,788 --> 00:41:38,622
The tunnel will keep on going.

403
00:41:38,623 --> 00:41:42,042
But look up.
You should see the access ladder.

404
00:41:47,382 --> 00:41:50,217
I'm at a shaft. I'm going to climb up.

405
00:42:01,854 --> 00:42:03,772
What are you doing?

406
00:42:04,316 --> 00:42:05,983
Still climbing.

407
00:42:26,712 --> 00:42:28,672
This looks like it.

408
00:44:02,142 --> 00:44:03,601
I'm done.

409
00:44:16,239 --> 00:44:18,574
Oh, what the hell is this?

410
00:44:23,622 --> 00:44:26,081
Hey, you've got a utility crew
all over the entrance.

411
00:44:26,082 --> 00:44:28,334
You're going to have to find
another way out.

412
00:45:02,243 --> 00:45:03,869
Where are you?

413
00:45:11,752 --> 00:45:15,839
I'm at de la Montagne and Ottawa.
Repeat, de la Montagne and Ottawa.

414
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,966
Got it. We're on our way.

415
00:45:24,432 --> 00:45:26,808
Okay, this should be it right here.

416
00:45:27,561 --> 00:45:30,729
Okay, we're here.
I'm just trying to find you.

417
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:33,148
There, he's right over there.

418
00:45:55,463 --> 00:45:57,297
Okay, you're all clear.

419
00:45:57,298 --> 00:45:58,840
Coming out.

420
00:46:43,595 --> 00:46:45,262
Hello?

421
00:46:46,681 --> 00:46:47,973
Anybody home?

422
00:47:07,076 --> 00:47:10,954
Hey, champagne. Nice touch.

423
00:47:10,955 --> 00:47:12,122
Nice dress.

424
00:47:12,123 --> 00:47:13,415
- You like?
- Yes.

425
00:47:13,416 --> 00:47:14,916
Thank you.

426
00:47:16,461 --> 00:47:20,631
So, you asked me a question
a couple of days ago.

427
00:47:21,758 --> 00:47:24,593
And you gave it some serious thought.

428
00:47:24,594 --> 00:47:27,262
- Actually, I forgot the question.
- Okay.

429
00:47:28,598 --> 00:47:30,641
No, here's my answer.

430
00:47:31,643 --> 00:47:34,936
- Hey, you're not holding up your glass.
- Sorry.

431
00:47:36,856 --> 00:47:39,525
My father was a lawyer.
Very smart man.

432
00:47:39,526 --> 00:47:42,986
And he would always say
that a deal is only good

433
00:47:42,987 --> 00:47:47,449
if it leaves both parties
feeling as if they gave up something.

434
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:51,495
Is an answer coming soon?
'Cause the glass is getting heavy.

435
00:47:52,163 --> 00:47:58,126
Okay. I will change my life.
I will move here.

436
00:48:00,714 --> 00:48:02,464
I will love you.

437
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:07,886
And believe that this
is the best decision that I've made.

438
00:48:09,639 --> 00:48:12,349
But I will not move here if it means that

439
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:14,518
one day I might have to
talk to you through glass.

440
00:48:14,519 --> 00:48:17,312
I won't move here if it means
spending my nights worrying.

441
00:48:17,313 --> 00:48:22,150
So, if you can promise me
as of right now that you're through,

442
00:48:23,862 --> 00:48:26,530
then we can drink to making changes.

443
00:48:35,206 --> 00:48:38,208
I... I said you could drink now.

444
00:48:38,209 --> 00:48:39,752
I know.

445
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:41,754
I want to do all that.

446
00:48:43,548 --> 00:48:47,342
I just have to tell you that I've got to do
one more thing

447
00:48:47,343 --> 00:48:50,220
- and that's it.
- Oh, for fuck...

448
00:48:50,221 --> 00:48:51,847
Everything you said is great.

449
00:48:51,848 --> 00:48:55,726
It's perfect.
I just have one more thing I have to do.

450
00:48:55,727 --> 00:48:57,853
I don't believe you put that out there
when you knew

451
00:48:57,854 --> 00:48:59,938
- you couldn't follow through.
- I put it out there because I...

452
00:48:59,939 --> 00:49:01,189
When you knew you couldn't
make the commitment.

453
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:03,066
I am following through.
This is my last one, I promise you.

454
00:49:03,067 --> 00:49:06,278
- Yeah, sure it is, Nicky.
- I promise you it is my last one.

455
00:49:06,279 --> 00:49:09,907
Then quit. Quit now.
What does "one last one" mean?

456
00:49:09,908 --> 00:49:11,867
It means we don't need
anything, anything.

457
00:49:11,868 --> 00:49:15,704
I didn't need anything before
and I don't need anything now.

458
00:49:15,705 --> 00:49:18,081
But what I wanted was to be with you.

459
00:49:18,082 --> 00:49:21,293
And what I didn't need was exactly
this kind of painful bullshit.

460
00:49:21,294 --> 00:49:25,714
You see, my life wasn't perfect before.
But at least we were clear.

461
00:49:28,802 --> 00:49:31,219
You got to give me some...

462
00:49:32,263 --> 00:49:34,556
See you when I see you.

463
00:50:44,961 --> 00:50:47,462
Hey, hey, hey. What are you doing?

464
00:50:47,463 --> 00:50:50,298
Somebody put fingerprints
on my window, Danny.

465
00:50:50,299 --> 00:50:51,717
You don't need to do it, it's okay.
It's okay.

466
00:50:51,718 --> 00:50:53,635
I like a clean window, Danny.

467
00:50:53,636 --> 00:50:58,139
It's all right. You know, we missed you
last night. Are you feeling better?

468
00:50:58,140 --> 00:50:59,808
- Yes, thank you.
- Sure?

469
00:50:59,809 --> 00:51:01,059
- Yes, I'm okay. Thank you, Danny.
- All right.

470
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:02,394
Take your time.

471
00:51:02,395 --> 00:51:04,021
- Okay. Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

472
00:51:04,022 --> 00:51:05,647
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

473
00:51:22,916 --> 00:51:24,750
That's your safe.

474
00:51:30,048 --> 00:51:33,508
Traeger standing jeweler's safe.
This year's model.

475
00:51:33,509 --> 00:51:36,428
Well, if it's new, it's gonna be tough
to get the schematics.

476
00:51:36,429 --> 00:51:38,680
I've got all this year's books.

477
00:51:38,681 --> 00:51:41,099
- Really?
- Yeah. What else?

478
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:44,519
Okay, the system's Ironclad Security.

479
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:46,104
They're a big
commercial industrial outfit.

480
00:51:46,105 --> 00:51:48,523
They handle a lot of
the government buildings here.

481
00:51:48,524 --> 00:51:50,191
This building's pretty old.

482
00:51:50,192 --> 00:51:52,736
You know, the lines are
all over the place. They're easy to find.

483
00:51:52,737 --> 00:51:55,614
I can cut in three or four different places
and let you in from there,

484
00:51:55,615 --> 00:51:58,700
but I got to have
the engineering pass codes.

485
00:51:58,701 --> 00:52:00,285
I've been looking.
They don't keep them in here.

486
00:52:00,286 --> 00:52:03,706
They'll be at Ironclad.
I don't know what to do.

487
00:52:03,707 --> 00:52:05,290
Okay.

488
00:52:06,793 --> 00:52:09,419
What, are you calling someone now?

489
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:14,383
What! Who is it?

490
00:52:14,384 --> 00:52:15,551
It's me. Turn down the music.

491
00:52:18,388 --> 00:52:22,933
Hey, Nick, I am fucked up.
My mother's totally out of control.

492
00:52:22,934 --> 00:52:24,977
Listen, listen carefully.

493
00:52:24,978 --> 00:52:26,645
Ironclad Security.

494
00:52:26,646 --> 00:52:27,897
Big outfit.

495
00:52:27,898 --> 00:52:31,316
I need engineering pass codes
for the Customs House.

496
00:52:31,317 --> 00:52:33,318
I don't know, man.
My concentration's shot.

497
00:52:33,319 --> 00:52:34,820
I haven't slept in, like, a month.

498
00:52:34,821 --> 00:52:37,239
Wait, what customs house?

499
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:38,574
Montreal.

500
00:52:39,743 --> 00:52:42,452
Nick, you're not pissing
in our own pool, man?

501
00:52:42,453 --> 00:52:45,247
You have always said you were never
going to do a job here in Montreal.

502
00:52:45,248 --> 00:52:47,290
I know. I know. Can you do it?

503
00:52:47,291 --> 00:52:49,626
Steven! Who are you talking to
at this hour?

504
00:52:49,627 --> 00:52:54,172
I am having a civil fucking conversation
with a friend of mine, Mother!

505
00:52:54,674 --> 00:52:56,508
Are you... Are you okay?

506
00:52:56,509 --> 00:52:58,468
She is a ghoul.

507
00:52:58,469 --> 00:53:01,680
- Now, tell me exactly what you want.
- Okay, just one second.

508
00:53:01,681 --> 00:53:04,934
I'm going to put someone on
who can tell you what we need.

509
00:53:04,935 --> 00:53:07,144
Just tell him what you need.

510
00:53:07,145 --> 00:53:10,689
I need separate disarm and reset
master codes for the whole system.

511
00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:14,359
And I need the individual sector by-pass
codes so I can shut down one zone

512
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:17,654
without lighting off
the whole board. Okay?

513
00:53:17,655 --> 00:53:18,948
Yes.

514
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:22,284
- You got that?
- Got it.

515
00:53:22,285 --> 00:53:24,703
Listen, I'm going to need this
within 48 hours.

516
00:53:24,704 --> 00:53:27,330
If you do that, I'll double your last price.

517
00:53:27,331 --> 00:53:32,169
Dude, give me a Kaypro 64 and
a live dial tone, and I can do anything.

518
00:53:34,505 --> 00:53:37,633
Now you are going to die!

519
00:53:38,843 --> 00:53:42,972
This is someone you work with?
And you're giving me a hard time.

520
00:54:14,671 --> 00:54:17,255
Thursday, 8:07 a. m.

521
00:54:18,175 --> 00:54:20,926
Hi, got your message.
One of the stewardesses is sick,

522
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:24,096
so I have to cover for her
on a New York run.

523
00:54:24,597 --> 00:54:28,892
We have to talk when I come
through in a couple of days, okay? Bye.

524
00:54:30,311 --> 00:54:32,021
End of messages.

525
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,824
Just lock it.

526
00:54:45,202 --> 00:54:47,036
You work here?

527
00:54:47,037 --> 00:54:48,578
No, here.

528
00:54:57,172 --> 00:54:59,882
Come on. Come on, come on in.

529
00:55:16,524 --> 00:55:18,358
Want some coffee?

530
00:55:19,069 --> 00:55:20,610
Yeah, yeah.

531
00:55:25,616 --> 00:55:28,202
Is this what we're dealing with?

532
00:55:32,123 --> 00:55:33,456
Page 720.

533
00:55:38,129 --> 00:55:40,005
Where can I get one of these?

534
00:55:40,006 --> 00:55:42,591
You got to know the right people.

535
00:55:43,634 --> 00:55:46,262
"Traeger floor safe. " Here it is.

536
00:55:47,222 --> 00:55:52,101
"Solid steel body,
filled door with aluminum and cobalt.

537
00:55:53,311 --> 00:55:56,272
"Half-inch hard plate. Double dial. "

538
00:55:58,316 --> 00:56:00,609
You're going to need two, three hours
to drill through that.

539
00:56:00,610 --> 00:56:02,236
You can't drill this.

540
00:56:02,237 --> 00:56:03,779
Why not?

541
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:06,865
Because this is a newer model
and it's got these glass packs.

542
00:56:06,866 --> 00:56:09,826
See the glass pack here. See that?

543
00:56:10,287 --> 00:56:13,497
Drill through that, the glass breaks
and those bolts spring into place.

544
00:56:13,498 --> 00:56:14,999
You're fucked. They're locked.

545
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,751
Forget it,
you can't break it with a bulldozer.

546
00:56:17,752 --> 00:56:20,378
I've never seen anything like that.
What do you have in mind?

547
00:56:20,379 --> 00:56:24,549
I don't know. But if somebody built it,
somebody can unbuild it.

548
00:56:34,269 --> 00:56:37,355
Yeah, now see, when I shut this down,
you'll see this light go off.

549
00:56:37,356 --> 00:56:40,398
But up in the booth nothing will register.

550
00:56:43,111 --> 00:56:45,529
- Is that your box?
- That's it.

551
00:56:45,989 --> 00:56:48,157
That's a fucking monster.
That's three times the size of this.

552
00:56:48,158 --> 00:56:50,326
Even bigger than that.

553
00:56:50,327 --> 00:56:52,161
See that over there?

554
00:56:53,454 --> 00:56:55,539
You can see it better over here.

555
00:56:56,208 --> 00:56:58,667
That's an active infrared post.

556
00:56:59,336 --> 00:57:01,337
I don't know.
That wasn't on the system specs.

557
00:57:01,338 --> 00:57:03,172
I mean, that's got to be
some independent loop

558
00:57:03,173 --> 00:57:05,549
they set up just in the cage.

559
00:57:06,009 --> 00:57:08,010
I'll take care of it.

560
00:57:10,222 --> 00:57:11,513
Yeah?

561
00:57:14,142 --> 00:57:18,896
All right. Just calm down.
Okay, I'll be over in a few minutes.

562
00:57:19,856 --> 00:57:22,858
I gotta take care of something.
I'll drop you off.

563
00:57:47,384 --> 00:57:50,468
My mom's only out
for about a half an hour.

564
00:57:52,931 --> 00:57:54,056
So what's the emergency?

565
00:57:54,057 --> 00:57:57,351
Bottom line is, I was cruising around
Ironclad's secure server

566
00:57:57,352 --> 00:58:00,438
down at the root COBOL level
when someone counter-cracked me.

567
00:58:00,439 --> 00:58:03,523
Hacked back into my machines.
My data.

568
00:58:03,524 --> 00:58:05,359
For three minutes I was fully exposed.

569
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:09,321
Now I have to firewall
my whole operations all from scratch.

570
00:58:09,822 --> 00:58:12,283
Can you just tell me that in English?

571
00:58:12,284 --> 00:58:16,454
Sorry, I was a few keystrokes away
from pulling up those engineering codes

572
00:58:16,455 --> 00:58:18,538
when I bump into
a guy on the other end.

573
00:58:18,539 --> 00:58:19,957
What's on the other end?

574
00:58:19,958 --> 00:58:23,627
Ironclad's computers. My guess is he's
some low-level systems administrator.

575
00:58:23,628 --> 00:58:28,590
So we switch to a private chat room,
and he sends me this.

576
00:58:30,843 --> 00:58:35,389
Can you believe that? The guy comes
into my world and calls me an asshole.

577
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:37,057
Steven, can you get me
the by-pass codes?

578
00:58:37,058 --> 00:58:38,309
I type, "How much?" And he types back,

579
00:58:38,310 --> 00:58:40,144
"Engineering codes
for the Customs House basement?"

580
00:58:40,145 --> 00:58:42,271
And I say,
"You guessed it, Blue's Clues. "

581
00:58:42,272 --> 00:58:44,482
And he says, "Fuck you. "
And I say, "No, no, fuck you. "

582
00:58:44,483 --> 00:58:47,234
And he says, "No, fuck you. "
And I'm like, "No, fuck you!"

583
00:58:47,235 --> 00:58:48,360
And then he's like, "No, fuck... "

584
00:58:48,361 --> 00:58:51,363
Steven. Steven, Steven.
Can you get me the by-pass codes?

585
00:58:52,782 --> 00:58:55,909
The guy wants 50 thou
in exchange for the codes.

586
00:58:56,869 --> 00:58:58,370
50,000?

587
00:58:58,371 --> 00:58:59,621
Yes.

588
00:59:02,625 --> 00:59:03,834
Get the account number.

589
00:59:03,835 --> 00:59:06,086
I'll wire the money
and he'll deliver the codes through you.

590
00:59:06,087 --> 00:59:07,629
Negative. The guy won't
go for a transfer.

591
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:09,756
He wants cash,
and he wants to do it in person.

592
00:59:11,343 --> 00:59:13,260
- Anything else?
- No.

593
00:59:13,261 --> 00:59:14,386
You set it up.

594
00:59:14,387 --> 00:59:16,138
No, no, stay, stay. I'll let myself out.

595
00:59:16,139 --> 00:59:17,515
And when this whole score is done,

596
00:59:17,516 --> 00:59:19,308
I'm going to brute this creep
with everything I got.

597
00:59:19,309 --> 00:59:23,979
By the time I'm done with this fuck,
he won't be able to hide in Bolivia!

598
00:59:51,632 --> 00:59:53,050
Jesus, look at all these people.

599
00:59:54,677 --> 00:59:56,845
Who sets up a meeting
in a public park?

600
01:00:01,684 --> 01:00:04,228
- Do you see him?
- Still looking.

601
01:00:19,702 --> 01:00:21,119
Got him.

602
01:00:21,538 --> 01:00:23,414
He brought back-up.

603
01:00:24,707 --> 01:00:26,542
Okay, I got him.

604
01:00:39,556 --> 01:00:42,224
Hey, how you doing, how you doing?
Good to see you. Good to see you.

605
01:00:42,225 --> 01:00:45,603
What's up? Shake my hand.
That's right. You my guy?

606
01:00:45,604 --> 01:00:46,895
Yeah.

607
01:00:46,896 --> 01:00:48,439
Who's this?

608
01:00:49,107 --> 01:00:50,399
Cousin.

609
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,568
Cousin? Okay.

610
01:00:52,569 --> 01:00:53,902
See the guy over my left shoulder,

611
01:00:53,903 --> 01:00:57,615
back there on the bench,
reading a paper. The big one?

612
01:00:59,242 --> 01:01:01,743
That's my cousin. Okay?

613
01:01:02,745 --> 01:01:06,915
So we've all got family here,
which is nice, I think, yeah? Okay.

614
01:01:06,916 --> 01:01:11,670
I'll give you that. Take a look inside,
make sure you're happy, all right?

615
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:17,384
No, don't take that out.
Don't take that out.

616
01:01:17,385 --> 01:01:20,387
Hey, man. Don't give me orders.
I get orders all day, okay?

617
01:01:20,388 --> 01:01:22,722
You can't count the money
in a public place.

618
01:01:22,723 --> 01:01:25,225
That's why you don't set
a meeting in a park.

619
01:01:25,226 --> 01:01:27,478
Just for future reference.

620
01:01:27,937 --> 01:01:30,397
Just flip through it in the bag.

621
01:01:31,732 --> 01:01:33,233
We're about set to go here. You ready?

622
01:01:33,234 --> 01:01:35,653
What the fuck is that?
What are you doing?

623
01:01:35,654 --> 01:01:38,280
He's going to give me the numbers,
I'm going to read them into this mike

624
01:01:38,281 --> 01:01:41,825
to a friend of mine,
who's going to check them out.

625
01:01:43,703 --> 01:01:46,539
You think I was going to write it down
on a cocktail napkin?

626
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:48,081
Okay, ready.

627
01:01:48,542 --> 01:01:50,292
Okay, you're on.

628
01:01:51,503 --> 01:01:54,838
First set, 3-1-7.

629
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:57,132
3-1-7.

630
01:01:57,133 --> 01:01:58,717
Got it, 3-1-7.

631
01:01:58,718 --> 01:02:02,095
Steven, 3-1-7.

632
01:02:03,014 --> 01:02:04,682
Confirm, 3-1-7.

633
01:02:10,355 --> 01:02:12,772
It'll just be a second.

634
01:02:12,773 --> 01:02:15,734
What are you guys,
like, maternal cousins, or what?

635
01:02:29,207 --> 01:02:30,541
First numbers are clean.

636
01:02:30,542 --> 01:02:32,334
They're clean, they're clean.

637
01:02:32,335 --> 01:02:34,503
You tell the hack
at the other end of that wire

638
01:02:34,504 --> 01:02:36,672
if he tries to get into my system again,
I will fry him, okay?

639
01:02:36,673 --> 01:02:38,924
Okay, why don't we worry
about next time next time?

640
01:02:38,925 --> 01:02:42,135
Okay, let's get this done
before people start looking at us.

641
01:02:42,136 --> 01:02:44,555
- Give me the second set.
-9-4-6.

642
01:02:44,556 --> 01:02:46,056
9-4-6.

643
01:02:46,057 --> 01:02:49,101
9-4-6, repeat, 9-4-6.

644
01:02:49,644 --> 01:02:50,936
9-4-6.

645
01:02:58,403 --> 01:03:00,070
Take it easy, guys.
Relax. Have a smoke.

646
01:03:00,071 --> 01:03:01,405
I don't smoke.

647
01:03:01,406 --> 01:03:04,074
I don't smoke either, so good for us.

648
01:03:04,075 --> 01:03:05,784
What, are you guys local?
You live around here or what?

649
01:03:05,785 --> 01:03:08,746
Why are you asking
so many fucking questions?

650
01:03:13,585 --> 01:03:14,752
They're good.

651
01:03:14,753 --> 01:03:17,212
Second set is good. Second set is good.

652
01:03:17,213 --> 01:03:19,131
What's the third one?

653
01:03:20,759 --> 01:03:22,384
5-8-3-9.

654
01:03:23,010 --> 01:03:24,637
5-8-3-9.

655
01:03:24,929 --> 01:03:30,392
5-8-3-9. Got it. 5-8-3-9.

656
01:03:40,528 --> 01:03:42,613
This is taking too long.
I'm gonna fucking lose it.

657
01:03:42,614 --> 01:03:44,615
Shut up, Eric.

658
01:03:44,616 --> 01:03:47,909
They have to verify the numbers
off the server. It takes some time.

659
01:03:47,910 --> 01:03:49,411
Just relax, Eric.

660
01:03:53,082 --> 01:03:55,875
Can you help me out?
It's turning into amateur hour out here.

661
01:03:55,876 --> 01:03:57,670
- Fuck you, asshole.
- What are you doing?

662
01:03:57,671 --> 01:04:00,255
He's got a gun. One of them has a gun.

663
01:04:00,256 --> 01:04:01,548
That guy's got a gun.

664
01:04:01,549 --> 01:04:03,509
Steven, how's it going?
We're losing these guys. Come on.

665
01:04:03,510 --> 01:04:04,718
I'm working it, man.

666
01:04:04,719 --> 01:04:06,345
Steven, want some lunch?

667
01:04:06,346 --> 01:04:08,681
I'm on the phone, bitch!

668
01:04:08,682 --> 01:04:09,889
- You all right?
- We're fine.

669
01:04:09,890 --> 01:04:12,434
We're fine. Don't anybody move.

670
01:04:12,435 --> 01:04:15,646
Eric, why don't you look at my hand
right now?

671
01:04:16,773 --> 01:04:19,274
You take that on,
I'm gonna take this out.

672
01:04:19,275 --> 01:04:21,360
It'll be a big fucking mess.

673
01:04:21,361 --> 01:04:23,153
Put it away, Eric.

674
01:04:23,571 --> 01:04:25,905
There's kids all around.
What are you thinking?

675
01:04:25,906 --> 01:04:30,661
Put it away, take a deep breath
and just put it in your back pocket.

676
01:04:30,662 --> 01:04:32,246
Put it away.

677
01:04:36,251 --> 01:04:37,585
They're all good.

678
01:04:37,586 --> 01:04:39,086
Last set of numbers confirmed.

679
01:04:39,087 --> 01:04:42,673
Last set of numbers confirmed.
Let's get out of here.

680
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:53,392
Next time, don't bring a gun.

681
01:04:53,393 --> 01:04:57,563
Listen, I thought I might need one,
and I did, and now we've got the codes.

682
01:04:57,564 --> 01:04:59,356
Don't bring a gun.

683
01:05:05,113 --> 01:05:06,905
Jesus fucking Christ.

684
01:05:07,949 --> 01:05:11,368
I called.
They said you hadn't checked in yet. No.

685
01:05:16,416 --> 01:05:18,793
So what time are you getting in?

686
01:05:21,379 --> 01:05:23,589
Come on, honey, don't stay at a hotel.

687
01:05:23,590 --> 01:05:26,884
Just come over to my place.
I'll cook something.

688
01:05:37,771 --> 01:05:41,857
Yeah. Yeah, no, I was just saying,
come to my place, I'll cook something.

689
01:05:41,858 --> 01:05:44,025
You know, we'll talk, okay?

690
01:06:15,141 --> 01:06:17,935
So when do you got to be there?

691
01:06:17,936 --> 01:06:21,563
I'll go in, in a couple of hours
or something, okay? I'm fine.

692
01:06:23,441 --> 01:06:26,610
Listen, tell me something.
Tell me something...

693
01:06:26,611 --> 01:06:28,737
All the years you've been doing this,

694
01:06:28,738 --> 01:06:31,907
what's the biggest gamble
you ever took on a job?

695
01:06:31,908 --> 01:06:34,827
You know, biggest long shot?

696
01:06:34,828 --> 01:06:37,078
I don't take long shots.

697
01:06:37,079 --> 01:06:39,915
Look, I know you're careful, you know.
I'm careful, too.

698
01:06:39,916 --> 01:06:41,375
That's not what I mean. I mean...

699
01:06:42,544 --> 01:06:45,253
You know, when you were starting out,
when you were just getting going,

700
01:06:45,254 --> 01:06:47,840
you must've taken
some flyers here and there.

701
01:06:47,841 --> 01:06:50,217
Done something that was a little wild.
I'm just curious.

702
01:06:50,218 --> 01:06:52,219
Never took long shots.

703
01:06:55,390 --> 01:06:57,224
I'm going to say something to you.

704
01:06:57,225 --> 01:06:59,810
You're smart, you're talented,
you know a few things.

705
01:06:59,811 --> 01:07:03,063
But talent means nothing in this game
if you don't make the right choices.

706
01:07:03,064 --> 01:07:04,523
There's plenty of talented people
out there

707
01:07:04,524 --> 01:07:06,608
who never see the light of day anymore.

708
01:07:06,609 --> 01:07:08,652
Last thing. It takes discipline.

709
01:07:08,653 --> 01:07:10,779
Because this whole game
is one big long shot.

710
01:07:10,780 --> 01:07:11,947
And if you don't have the discipline to

711
01:07:11,948 --> 01:07:13,866
stay away from the flyers
or from the gambles,

712
01:07:13,867 --> 01:07:16,159
or whatever else
you want to call a stupid move,

713
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:19,371
then, my friend, I'm afraid to say
one day, you will go down.

714
01:07:19,372 --> 01:07:20,497
It's inevitable.

715
01:07:21,583 --> 01:07:23,041
You want my advice?

716
01:07:24,753 --> 01:07:26,795
Make a list of everything you want now

717
01:07:26,796 --> 01:07:30,090
and then plan on spending the next
25 years of your life getting it.

718
01:07:30,091 --> 01:07:32,217
Slowly, piece by piece.

719
01:07:37,473 --> 01:07:38,640
Yeah, I mean...

720
01:07:40,018 --> 01:07:41,268
I see what you're saying.

721
01:07:43,312 --> 01:07:47,274
But still, I'm looking at you,
and you got all this already.

722
01:07:47,984 --> 01:07:50,694
And you're still sitting here with me,
working with a partner,

723
01:07:50,695 --> 01:07:51,987
in the city that you live in,

724
01:07:51,988 --> 01:07:56,324
on a job that's gotten more complicated
than you thought it was going to be.

725
01:07:56,325 --> 01:07:59,745
So I know you're still taking a shot
at something.

726
01:08:05,043 --> 01:08:06,334
I gotta go.

727
01:08:08,504 --> 01:08:09,671
See you tomorrow.

728
01:08:10,172 --> 01:08:11,214
Okay.

729
01:08:18,056 --> 01:08:20,015
The maintenance crews
come into the tunnels by 6:00 a. m.

730
01:08:20,016 --> 01:08:22,350
I gotta be back in the hole by 5:30.

731
01:08:22,351 --> 01:08:25,353
As soon as the guards leave you got to
tell me right away. You can't be late.

732
01:08:25,354 --> 01:08:26,772
I'm not worried about my end.

733
01:08:26,773 --> 01:08:29,817
I'm wondering how the hell you think
you're going to break that safe

734
01:08:29,818 --> 01:08:33,570
in a half an hour. You know? I mean...

735
01:08:52,590 --> 01:08:55,592
- Is that even possible?
- Just physics.

736
01:09:00,724 --> 01:09:03,517
- How long is that going to take?
- Twelve, 15 minutes, tops.

737
01:09:03,518 --> 01:09:05,686
Fifteen minutes, tops?

738
01:09:07,188 --> 01:09:12,609
Okay. Okay.
So then if you are on the box by 5:00,

739
01:09:13,236 --> 01:09:16,405
then the prize goes in the bag by 5:15,
you got no problem at all.

740
01:09:16,406 --> 01:09:19,575
Yup. 5:15, 5:30, I'm back in the hole.
You reset the system.

741
01:09:19,576 --> 01:09:22,953
It's perfect. I mean, I'll pack up my shit.

742
01:09:22,954 --> 01:09:24,413
I can meet you here.
We can go to Max's

743
01:09:24,414 --> 01:09:25,706
or I can meet you straight at Max's.

744
01:09:25,707 --> 01:09:28,166
- We're not going to meet back here.
- I'll meet you at Max's then.

745
01:09:28,167 --> 01:09:29,209
No. No.

746
01:09:29,753 --> 01:09:32,671
You'll finish out your shift.
I go to Max, he does his thing,

747
01:09:32,672 --> 01:09:34,423
he pays us off,
we never see each other again.

748
01:09:34,424 --> 01:09:35,841
Enough, enough. Forget it.
Just forget it.

749
01:09:35,842 --> 01:09:38,802
I'm going to come with you to Max's.
We'll deliver it together.

750
01:09:38,803 --> 01:09:40,429
- No, you're not.
- No, I'm telling you.

751
01:09:40,430 --> 01:09:43,599
Listen, I've done this
down to the last detail.

752
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:46,643
Don't put me on the sideline
when it's time to collect. Don't do it.

753
01:09:46,644 --> 01:09:48,687
Listen to me, listen to me.

754
01:09:48,688 --> 01:09:50,814
You do anything out of the ordinary,
you're going to get made.

755
01:09:50,815 --> 01:09:54,818
Do you understand that?
Be smart, finish out your shift.

756
01:09:59,699 --> 01:10:02,034
- You're the boss.
- Okay.

757
01:10:17,467 --> 01:10:19,009
Steven got these from a supplier.

758
01:10:19,010 --> 01:10:22,220
They're throwaways.
Totally untraceable.

759
01:10:26,017 --> 01:10:29,812
People are talking. They say Max
is in trouble with Teddy Salida

760
01:10:29,813 --> 01:10:33,149
and he's pulling off a big job
to get rid of him.

761
01:10:34,317 --> 01:10:36,276
That's what they say?

762
01:10:37,946 --> 01:10:40,864
Maybe you should walk away
from this one.

763
01:11:36,713 --> 01:11:38,047
Max?

764
01:11:42,468 --> 01:11:43,760
Max?

765
01:12:08,119 --> 01:12:10,162
What are you doing down here?

766
01:12:10,163 --> 01:12:13,749
Jesus Christ,
you scared the shit out of me!

767
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:16,585
What the hell are you doing down here?

768
01:12:17,045 --> 01:12:19,880
Did you involve Teddy Salida in this?

769
01:12:19,881 --> 01:12:22,216
- What, Teddy Salida?
- Yeah.

770
01:12:23,176 --> 01:12:25,010
What, why would you say that?

771
01:12:25,011 --> 01:12:29,223
I see these guys outside.
They look like they might be with him.

772
01:12:30,433 --> 01:12:33,852
- How much you into him for?
-4 million.

773
01:12:36,147 --> 01:12:38,023
Look, how do you think I got all this?

774
01:12:38,024 --> 01:12:42,778
They gave it to me and a house in
Bermuda? What's the matter with you?

775
01:12:43,154 --> 01:12:44,821
What's he know?

776
01:12:45,531 --> 01:12:48,242
- About what?
- About what we're doing.

777
01:12:49,619 --> 01:12:52,955
Nothing. I told him I found something
that would go for eight

778
01:12:52,956 --> 01:12:56,083
and that we'd split the profits, that's all.

779
01:12:57,294 --> 01:13:00,796
What are you actually selling
the scepter for, Max?

780
01:13:02,007 --> 01:13:04,091
Thirty million dollars.

781
01:13:05,718 --> 01:13:06,802
Jesus.

782
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:09,554
Max, what were you thinking?

783
01:13:09,555 --> 01:13:10,806
What do you mean,
"What was I thinking?"

784
01:13:10,807 --> 01:13:11,932
Same thing you were thinking.

785
01:13:11,933 --> 01:13:14,226
How are we going to get out
from under all this bullshit

786
01:13:14,227 --> 01:13:16,770
we've been living, for Christ's sake?

787
01:13:16,771 --> 01:13:18,438
Chance came. Took it.

788
01:13:19,732 --> 01:13:21,066
It's gonna work out fine.

789
01:13:21,067 --> 01:13:24,028
- No, it's not.
- Well, what do you mean it's not?

790
01:13:24,029 --> 01:13:26,364
It's not. It's a mess.
It's not going to work.

791
01:13:26,365 --> 01:13:29,325
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Wait, wait a fucking minute!

792
01:13:29,326 --> 01:13:32,619
This is absolutely clean, Nick.

793
01:13:32,620 --> 01:13:33,829
What are you worried about?

794
01:13:33,830 --> 01:13:36,707
Jesus Christ. It's my ass
on the line, anyways, not yours.

795
01:13:36,708 --> 01:13:38,583
I'm not taking
the biggest gamble of my life

796
01:13:38,584 --> 01:13:40,794
so I can hand my money
over to Teddy Salida.

797
01:13:40,795 --> 01:13:43,964
You think you're not going to get
your fucking money?

798
01:13:43,965 --> 01:13:45,883
Look, there's two things
you got to know.

799
01:13:45,884 --> 01:13:49,094
One is, you're going to get
every fucking red cent.

800
01:13:49,095 --> 01:13:53,391
- And, yeah, Teddy knows a little.
- He knows?

801
01:13:53,392 --> 01:13:55,684
- He knows a little I said.
- Yeah, so you did lie.

802
01:13:55,685 --> 01:14:00,605
Yeah, lied. I lied, you lied.
Shit happens, man! Christ Almighty!

803
01:14:00,606 --> 01:14:02,524
I lied for you and I lied for me.

804
01:14:02,525 --> 01:14:06,362
I had to say something to get you
to suit-up like always.

805
01:14:07,030 --> 01:14:08,072
Max...

806
01:14:10,658 --> 01:14:12,701
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to do it.

807
01:14:12,702 --> 01:14:19,666
Nick, it's a tiny door. Open the door,
take the shit, close the door, we're out.

808
01:14:20,001 --> 01:14:22,669
There's too much bullshit around it.

809
01:14:39,478 --> 01:14:41,272
What's that?

810
01:14:53,492 --> 01:14:54,826
The buyer.

811
01:14:56,913 --> 01:14:58,247
Real simple.

812
01:14:58,248 --> 01:15:00,458
You call him when you get the scepter.

813
01:15:00,459 --> 01:15:03,710
He'll meet you at the airstrip,
30 miles up the St. Lawrence.

814
01:15:03,711 --> 01:15:06,964
There's a little town called St. Croix.

815
01:15:08,925 --> 01:15:11,593
You give him the scepter.
He gives you the cash.

816
01:15:11,594 --> 01:15:14,805
You take your cut.
Then you wire me the rest.

817
01:15:15,348 --> 01:15:18,725
I'll give Teddy his, and you're clean.

818
01:15:23,148 --> 01:15:26,150
It's too risky. Can't...

819
01:15:31,114 --> 01:15:32,448
You don't know what you're doing.

820
01:15:33,492 --> 01:15:35,451
You know how long we go back?

821
01:15:36,619 --> 01:15:37,661
Huh?

822
01:15:38,497 --> 01:15:40,372
25 years.

823
01:15:42,459 --> 01:15:44,960
I'm going to tell you something.

824
01:15:45,670 --> 01:15:49,214
For the first time in my life, I'm scared.

825
01:15:50,049 --> 01:15:55,095
I don't know why it is. I was never
scared before, but I'm scared now, Nick.

826
01:15:55,096 --> 01:15:56,472
And you're right about Teddy.

827
01:15:56,473 --> 01:15:59,517
He's gonna blow me away, man,
if he can.

828
01:15:59,518 --> 01:16:03,228
If I don't get him his money, he...
Man, he...

829
01:16:07,526 --> 01:16:12,196
Hey, don't, don't, don't.
Don't let me slide on this one.

830
01:16:12,197 --> 01:16:14,365
I can't afford it, man.

831
01:16:20,205 --> 01:16:25,292
I can't... I can't scrap it out anymore.
I got to have some slack.

832
01:16:31,632 --> 01:16:33,967
All right. Okay.

833
01:16:36,012 --> 01:16:37,471
I hope you're not fucking me up.

834
01:16:37,472 --> 01:16:41,933
Nick. Hey, Nick. Nicky...

835
01:16:53,238 --> 01:16:55,780
I'm going down to check the power.

836
01:17:04,583 --> 01:17:06,542
- How much more equipment you got?
- Here you go.

837
01:17:12,549 --> 01:17:14,383
- Sorry, sorry.
- It's okay, Brian.

838
01:17:14,384 --> 01:17:17,136
- Come on in. Come on in.
- It's my radio.

839
01:17:17,137 --> 01:17:18,387
Hey, what's all the commotion?

840
01:17:18,388 --> 01:17:20,598
Don't worry, Danny. They're just
beefing things up downstairs.

841
01:17:20,599 --> 01:17:22,682
- What for?
- Just a few cameras in the basement.

842
01:17:22,683 --> 01:17:24,893
- Yeah, like we're going to lose it, right?
- Lose what?

843
01:17:24,894 --> 01:17:26,395
You know that thing
we found in the piano leg?

844
01:17:26,396 --> 01:17:27,563
The big gold thing?

845
01:17:27,564 --> 01:17:30,441
Yeah, well, it turns out it's some sort of
French national treasure.

846
01:17:30,442 --> 01:17:31,567
It's called the scepter.

847
01:17:31,568 --> 01:17:34,820
Yeah, some expert got a look at those
pictures...

848
01:17:34,821 --> 01:17:37,823
We're getting calls
from the central office.

849
01:17:41,536 --> 01:17:44,413
Hey, it's me. Yeah, we got a problem.

850
01:17:45,415 --> 01:17:48,626
They got a camera over the
main door here, covering that.

851
01:17:48,627 --> 01:17:52,129
They got a camera here
looking right across the middle.

852
01:17:52,130 --> 01:17:56,883
And they got one special
just on the box. Sees this entire cage.

853
01:17:59,053 --> 01:18:01,138
This camera,
over there looking at the box,

854
01:18:01,139 --> 01:18:04,350
how high is it from the floor
and how low is it from the ceiling?

855
01:18:04,351 --> 01:18:07,645
Probably, 10, 12 feet up off the floor.

856
01:18:07,646 --> 01:18:11,148
Four feet down from the ceiling.
I think we're fucked.

857
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:14,693
So, let me see.

858
01:18:16,237 --> 01:18:19,448
When I'm here, you'll cut the feed

859
01:18:19,449 --> 01:18:22,159
when I get across here.
Then you'll restore it.

860
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:26,872
Then when I'm ready here, you'll cut
it again and I'll go to work here.

861
01:18:27,290 --> 01:18:29,208
I don't know about that, man.

862
01:18:29,209 --> 01:18:30,750
They know what it is,
so now they're going to move it

863
01:18:30,751 --> 01:18:31,877
as soon as they can.

864
01:18:31,878 --> 01:18:33,504
We're not going to get
another chance like this.

865
01:18:33,505 --> 01:18:36,465
We gotta go now or we don't go at all.

866
01:20:04,220 --> 01:20:05,971
Hi there. Hi.

867
01:20:15,064 --> 01:20:17,608
- Hi, Henri.
- Hi, Brian.

868
01:20:21,488 --> 01:20:24,072
- Okay, thank you.
- No problem.

869
01:20:24,324 --> 01:20:27,075
- Hi, Danny.
- Hello, Brian.

870
01:20:27,076 --> 01:20:30,746
Oh, look at you, with fancy new shoes.

871
01:20:31,623 --> 01:20:34,458
Yeah, you know,
my mom got those for me.

872
01:20:34,459 --> 01:20:38,545
- Oh, your mom gave you those?
- I think you got a girl.

873
01:20:38,546 --> 01:20:41,298
No, no girl, Danny. You're a stinker.

874
01:20:42,133 --> 01:20:45,678
Well, you and your new shoes
can give me a hand up on six tonight.

875
01:20:45,679 --> 01:20:47,638
We're going to wax
the whole cafeteria floor.

876
01:20:47,639 --> 01:20:50,599
- Okay, okay.
- You hit the garbage, I get the stuff,

877
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:53,226
I meet you there, what, 15 minutes?

878
01:20:53,227 --> 01:20:58,607
Fifteen, okay.
Okay, I'll get the garbage, Danny, okay.

879
01:20:59,233 --> 01:21:01,026
Bye-bye, André.

880
01:21:01,027 --> 01:21:02,902
Bye-bye.
You look good with those shoes.

881
01:21:02,903 --> 01:21:04,780
Yeah, thanks, I know.

882
01:21:28,597 --> 01:21:32,266
- Watch your step out there, Brian.
- I will. Thank you.

883
01:25:42,100 --> 01:25:46,896
Okay, okay, Danny.
Guess what time it is?

884
01:25:46,897 --> 01:25:48,064
I don't know.

885
01:25:48,065 --> 01:25:51,191
Yes, you do, Danny. It's lunch time.

886
01:25:51,192 --> 01:25:55,404
I'll tell you what. What do you say we
keep on working, finish the other side?

887
01:25:55,405 --> 01:25:57,990
What? No, Danny. Why?

888
01:25:57,991 --> 01:26:01,326
Then we can blow off the rest of the day
and grab some pancakes.

889
01:26:01,327 --> 01:26:02,494
It won't take us long.

890
01:26:02,495 --> 01:26:06,957
Just throw a little extra thinner
into the mix, it'll go like butter.

891
01:26:53,630 --> 01:26:57,174
Danny, I'm sorry. Danny...

892
01:26:57,175 --> 01:26:59,718
It's okay. Just leave it. I'll mop it up.

893
01:26:59,719 --> 01:27:01,553
- I will get some more.
- You don't need to...

894
01:27:01,554 --> 01:27:03,555
I will get some more.

895
01:27:03,556 --> 01:27:06,016
All right. You know where, ground floor?

896
01:27:06,017 --> 01:27:08,351
- Okay.
- You know the closet.

897
01:27:12,899 --> 01:27:15,484
Set to go. Set to go.

898
01:27:36,631 --> 01:27:39,049
Are you there? I'm on my mark.

899
01:27:47,142 --> 01:27:49,726
- I'm on. Are you there?
- I'm here. We're running late.

900
01:27:49,727 --> 01:27:51,937
I know. I hit a snag.

901
01:27:53,064 --> 01:27:57,151
I'm already all set up, though.
Just give me one second.

902
01:28:02,323 --> 01:28:06,451
All right. I just gotta punch in
these codes. Just sit tight.

903
01:28:26,181 --> 01:28:27,514
I got it.

904
01:28:28,225 --> 01:28:30,184
Hang on one more beat.

905
01:28:40,444 --> 01:28:42,821
It's clear. Get in there.

906
01:29:09,140 --> 01:29:13,185
I'm inside the first cage. Repeat.
I am inside the first cage.

907
01:29:20,818 --> 01:29:22,611
You're all clear.

908
01:30:36,019 --> 01:30:39,021
- I'm set. Kill it.
- All right, on my mark.

909
01:30:49,866 --> 01:30:52,243
- Hey.
- Go.

910
01:30:57,207 --> 01:30:58,623
I'm here.

911
01:31:00,210 --> 01:31:02,002
There we go.

912
01:31:02,003 --> 01:31:05,463
Perfect. Tell me when
you're in the second position.

913
01:33:45,459 --> 01:33:46,833
Fuck.

914
01:34:30,920 --> 01:34:33,839
- How you doing down there?
- Almost there.

915
01:34:51,107 --> 01:34:53,317
Do you know where's Brian?

916
01:34:54,235 --> 01:34:55,611
No idea.

917
01:35:54,003 --> 01:35:55,212
I'm ready.

918
01:35:58,341 --> 01:36:01,134
I need a second here. Hold on.

919
01:36:01,135 --> 01:36:05,598
I'm all set. Cut the cameras.
Repeat, I'm all set. Cut the cameras.

920
01:36:09,352 --> 01:36:11,645
Gotta go. Got to go.

921
01:36:14,857 --> 01:36:17,109
What's up? What's up?

922
01:36:18,027 --> 01:36:20,862
I got company. I got company.

923
01:36:22,865 --> 01:36:24,742
Hang on one second.

924
01:36:24,743 --> 01:36:27,953
Just sit tight, sit tight. I'll be right back.

925
01:36:58,359 --> 01:36:59,818
Okay.

926
01:37:17,044 --> 01:37:19,713
Jack, where are you?

927
01:37:19,714 --> 01:37:25,552
Jack? Jack, come in. Jack?

928
01:37:41,611 --> 01:37:43,612
Jack, are you there?

929
01:38:05,051 --> 01:38:07,469
I'm pulling out. Repeat, I'm pulling out.

930
01:38:07,470 --> 01:38:08,929
- I'm back, I'm back.
- It's too late.

931
01:38:08,930 --> 01:38:11,223
- It's too late. I'm pulling out.
- No, it's not. We're good.

932
01:38:11,224 --> 01:38:13,559
We're good. Get ready to go.

933
01:38:14,894 --> 01:38:16,395
On my mark.

934
01:38:20,316 --> 01:38:21,776
Go! Go! Go!

935
01:38:36,040 --> 01:38:37,833
What the hell's wrong
with these machines?

936
01:38:50,430 --> 01:38:54,099
Hey, hey, hey, stop banging on it.
Check the connection.

937
01:39:14,913 --> 01:39:16,079
You see something?

938
01:39:16,706 --> 01:39:19,291
I don't know. Jeez.

939
01:39:37,059 --> 01:39:39,561
Call them. Call Ironclad.

940
01:39:40,229 --> 01:39:43,524
- And look like idiots?
- I don't care. Call them.

941
01:40:38,955 --> 01:40:42,040
Well, maybe it's some of the equipment
down in the basement.

942
01:40:43,960 --> 01:40:45,544
Okay, thanks.

943
01:40:47,672 --> 01:40:50,465
Someone will be here in a few minutes.

944
01:41:33,509 --> 01:41:38,179
Brian? Where are you, kid?

945
01:43:25,038 --> 01:43:28,040
Make a move, make a sound,
and you're dead.

946
01:43:28,041 --> 01:43:32,669
Do you understand me? Turn around.

947
01:43:36,340 --> 01:43:38,801
- Brian...
- Be quiet.

948
01:43:49,395 --> 01:43:50,729
Danny.

949
01:43:51,856 --> 01:43:53,023
Danny.

950
01:43:54,358 --> 01:43:57,153
I wish you'd not come down here, man.

951
01:44:00,157 --> 01:44:01,531
Get over there. Turn around.

952
01:44:01,532 --> 01:44:06,328
Come on. Let's go. Turn around.
Walk over there, open the door.

953
01:44:08,081 --> 01:44:11,000
Open it. Get inside.

954
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:15,004
Look at me.

955
01:44:16,547 --> 01:44:20,009
You're a good man. I don't want to
hurt you. But if you start making noise,

956
01:44:20,010 --> 01:44:24,847
or you try to open that fucking door,
I will do it. Do you understand me?

957
01:44:25,682 --> 01:44:28,058
Stay in there and be quiet.
Everything will be fine.

958
01:45:32,165 --> 01:45:36,919
I don't want to wait. I want you and
Tommy to go in the basement now.

959
01:45:36,920 --> 01:45:40,463
- Come on, André. I'm watching this.
- Laurent, please.

960
01:45:42,967 --> 01:45:47,596
Tommy, get Philippe. We're going to be
checking out the basement again.

961
01:46:30,890 --> 01:46:32,557
Hold it right there!

962
01:46:32,558 --> 01:46:35,060
- Are you crazy? What are you doing?
- Take it off and put it down, Nick.

963
01:46:35,061 --> 01:46:38,981
- Oh, come on.
- Take if off and put it down right now!

964
01:46:38,982 --> 01:46:40,191
Don't do this.

965
01:46:40,192 --> 01:46:42,484
Take it off and
put it on the fucking floor!

966
01:46:42,485 --> 01:46:44,486
- Please...
- Don't fucking argue with me!

967
01:46:44,487 --> 01:46:48,657
- Take it off and put it down!
- I can't. I can't...

968
01:46:49,993 --> 01:46:53,495
I'll put the next one in your knee, Nick.
I don't have time to fuck around.

969
01:46:53,496 --> 01:46:58,042
We can work the details out later.
I am leaving with that scepter.

970
01:46:58,043 --> 01:47:01,379
Now take it off and hand it over
right now!

971
01:47:09,554 --> 01:47:10,762
Put it down.

972
01:47:11,348 --> 01:47:12,514
Slowly.

973
01:47:13,725 --> 01:47:16,852
Now step back. Back up.

974
01:47:24,944 --> 01:47:26,278
Take off your mask.

975
01:47:26,279 --> 01:47:28,113
- What?
- Take it off!

976
01:47:30,116 --> 01:47:33,244
I don't have time to play games.
Take it off.

977
01:47:46,258 --> 01:47:48,259
Throw it over there.

978
01:47:49,761 --> 01:47:53,889
Step in the middle. Step in the middle.
That's right.

979
01:47:58,061 --> 01:47:59,395
You know, we wouldn't
have to be standing here

980
01:47:59,396 --> 01:48:02,147
if you'd just thrown a little respect
my way right at the beginning.

981
01:48:02,148 --> 01:48:04,149
- Just a little bit.
- This is a stupid move.

982
01:48:04,150 --> 01:48:05,984
- It is? Why?
- We all come out ahead.

983
01:48:05,985 --> 01:48:08,486
What are you doing?
Just go up there and finish this...

984
01:48:08,487 --> 01:48:10,239
It's a long shot.
I know I should play it tight.

985
01:48:10,240 --> 01:48:11,990
You know what I think
of your bullshit advice?

986
01:48:11,991 --> 01:48:15,327
I think that's you trying to talk me
into taking a sucker's share

987
01:48:15,328 --> 01:48:18,414
on a score that I set up
from the beginning!

988
01:48:19,916 --> 01:48:21,166
Do you think I'm fucking stupid?

989
01:48:21,167 --> 01:48:24,669
Do you think I don't see
what you and Max are doing?

990
01:48:25,755 --> 01:48:29,591
I mean, what is he giving you?
Five, six million?

991
01:48:29,592 --> 01:48:30,801
Tell me that's not true.

992
01:48:31,970 --> 01:48:33,595
See, that doesn't work for me.

993
01:48:35,807 --> 01:48:40,769
I appreciate your help, but you should've
made me a partner, you know.

994
01:48:40,770 --> 01:48:42,938
Now I gotta take a shot.

995
01:48:48,527 --> 01:48:52,281
Just sit tight. Just sit tight.
Everything will be fine.

996
01:48:56,035 --> 01:48:57,619
Now you got a choice.

997
01:48:57,620 --> 01:49:01,665
You can either head for that tunnel
or smile for that camera.

998
01:49:10,633 --> 01:49:11,800
André, what's happening?

999
01:49:11,801 --> 01:49:13,551
Get down, down to the basement!

1000
01:49:13,552 --> 01:49:16,347
We're being robbed!
We're being robbed!

1001
01:49:19,558 --> 01:49:20,851
André!

1002
01:49:20,852 --> 01:49:23,854
Get in. Go outside, wait for the police!

1003
01:49:31,654 --> 01:49:33,238
Let's go! Go! Go! Go!

1004
01:50:05,230 --> 01:50:06,855
Over here!

1005
01:50:11,027 --> 01:50:12,444
He's in the tunnel!

1006
01:50:14,030 --> 01:50:15,113
What do you see?

1007
01:50:17,534 --> 01:50:18,867
Find him!

1008
01:50:19,744 --> 01:50:22,538
Come on! Come on!

1009
01:50:36,595 --> 01:50:38,387
- I'm going down!
- Okay! Okay!

1010
01:50:38,388 --> 01:50:40,598
Come on! Come on! Come on!

1011
01:51:24,100 --> 01:51:26,644
- André? André?
- Shit.

1012
01:51:26,936 --> 01:51:28,979
- André, is there a fire?
- It's okay. It's okay.

1013
01:51:32,859 --> 01:51:35,194
- Where's Danny?
- Just get out!

1014
01:51:35,195 --> 01:51:36,945
- Okay.
- Just wait outside!

1015
01:51:39,491 --> 01:51:42,660
- My radio...
- Just wait outside!

1016
01:51:42,661 --> 01:51:44,244
Okay, bye-bye.

1017
01:51:47,248 --> 01:51:49,041
Wait, Brian. Wait.

1018
01:51:54,130 --> 01:51:57,550
It's Brian! It's Brian.

1019
01:51:57,551 --> 01:51:59,134
Have you seen Brian?

1020
01:51:59,135 --> 01:52:00,927
He's okay, he's okay. He's outside!

1021
01:52:00,928 --> 01:52:02,888
No, my God, it's him!

1022
01:52:19,780 --> 01:52:20,822
It's him!

1023
01:54:39,713 --> 01:54:43,298
Attention. The bus to Albany, New York,
leaves in five...

1024
01:54:46,010 --> 01:54:48,303
- Yup?
- Hey, did you make it?

1025
01:54:48,304 --> 01:54:49,722
Fuck you.

1026
01:54:50,473 --> 01:54:52,600
Come on, I'm just checking
to make sure you got out okay.

1027
01:54:52,601 --> 01:54:55,060
I knew you'd give them the slip.

1028
01:54:55,812 --> 01:54:59,481
- I'm almost home, too, here, by the way.
- Oh, you are? You sure about that?

1029
01:54:59,482 --> 01:55:02,276
Look, look, whatever you're thinking
about, whatever you're trying,

1030
01:55:02,277 --> 01:55:05,070
just forget it, okay? This is over now,
and you've just got to deal with it.

1031
01:55:05,071 --> 01:55:07,531
It's not over yet, 'cause you don't
know where you're going, asshole.

1032
01:55:07,532 --> 01:55:09,700
- And I do know where you're going.
- You don't know shit!

1033
01:55:09,701 --> 01:55:10,868
You know where you're going?

1034
01:55:10,869 --> 01:55:13,203
You don't know shit. I'm, like, five
minutes from being so far gone,

1035
01:55:13,204 --> 01:55:15,706
you're not even going to be able to
imagine the places I'm going, okay?

1036
01:55:15,707 --> 01:55:17,124
You're going nowhere
'cause you got nothing.

1037
01:55:17,125 --> 01:55:18,333
You know what I got.

1038
01:55:18,334 --> 01:55:20,502
You just can't deal with the fact
that I beat you.

1039
01:55:20,503 --> 01:55:24,298
Oh, yeah? What have you got? Huh?
What have you got?

1040
01:55:24,299 --> 01:55:26,216
You know what I've got.

1041
01:55:55,664 --> 01:55:56,914
Let me ask you something, Jack.

1042
01:55:56,915 --> 01:56:00,584
When did you start thinking
you were better than me, huh?

1043
01:56:00,585 --> 01:56:02,795
You still there, ace?

1044
01:56:03,463 --> 01:56:09,176
Okay, nicely done. Nicely done.
Now let's talk about this.

1045
01:56:09,177 --> 01:56:11,637
Okay, let's see. How'd you put it?
"Deal with it. It's over?"

1046
01:56:11,638 --> 01:56:14,765
No, no, no. I don't think so. You want
me to list the ways I can burn you?

1047
01:56:14,766 --> 01:56:17,893
We either work this out right now
or I will take you down.

1048
01:56:17,894 --> 01:56:21,480
Oh, yeah? How?
My shop, my tools, they're gone.

1049
01:56:21,481 --> 01:56:24,358
Me, my friend,
I'm just a tax-paying jazz club owner.

1050
01:56:24,359 --> 01:56:28,153
You, every cop in the city's going to
be looking for you right about now.

1051
01:56:28,154 --> 01:56:32,073
So if I were you, I'd quit making
threats and hit the road.

1052
01:56:35,411 --> 01:56:39,122
Nice working with you, ace.
Okay, bye-bye.

1053
01:57:12,824 --> 01:57:15,826
Montreal was stunned by
the daring pre-dawn robbery

1054
01:57:15,827 --> 01:57:18,412
of the old city's historic
Customs House.

1055
01:57:18,413 --> 01:57:20,831
A priceless scepter was stolen.

1056
01:57:20,832 --> 01:57:26,044
A senior night janitor identified this man
as the prime suspect in the burglary.

1057
01:57:26,045 --> 01:57:29,590
He was spotted leaving the scene
moments after the robbery.

1058
01:57:29,591 --> 01:57:31,884
He's now the focus
of a massive manhunt.

1059
01:57:31,885 --> 01:57:35,763
A second suspect vanished
from the scene without a trace.

1060
01:57:35,764 --> 01:57:38,098
Police have no solid leads...
