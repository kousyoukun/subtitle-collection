Thanks for ROROR!
HxHPRC: Enjoy your hours!

3
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,350
Wait.

4
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:46,393
What?

5
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:49,229
This.

6
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:51,773
Later.

7
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,360
I wanna smoke.

8
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,990
I wanna smoke.

9
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,660
Fine. Smoke.

10
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:09,082
Smoke all night.

11
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:17,317
Be still.
Do not turn around.

12
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:19,236
Do not turn around.

13
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,238
You will not be hurt.

14
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:45,395
- Bonjour, Nick.
- Bonjour, madame.

15
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:34,987
Albert.

16
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:40,075
Boss, hi.

17
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:43,078
- Jean-Claude.
- So, the trip was good?

18
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:46,707
- So, how are we doing?
- Great.

19
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:49,209
We have many reservations
for tonight.

20
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:51,295
Good. How many covers
did we have last night?

21
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:53,297
- Over 150.
- Good.

22
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,216
- Bar was steady.
- How was the music?

23
00:11:56,258 --> 00:11:58,844
- Great band.
- Good. Good.

24
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,267
Scotch on the rocks, please,
little water.

25
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,269
Yeah, sure.

26
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:25,913
Monsieur Max.

27
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:28,665
Where-- Where Nicky?

28
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:33,670
Voila. Back from Bermuda.

29
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:35,214
Did you have a good trip?

30
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:38,091
Well, not as interesting
as yours, I'm sure.

31
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:42,763
My God!
Let me get a look at you.

32
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:45,349
You look like shit.
What's your secret?

33
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:48,435
Jean-Claude,
set up number two for us.

34
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:50,020
Yeah, sure.

35
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:59,488
Just give us a little room.
Thank you.

36
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:04,701
For sure.

37
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:06,703
There we are.

38
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,168
Bermuda.

39
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:18,423
Oh, God.

40
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:21,885
Well.

41
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:25,681
- It was pretty tight out there.
- Good. It'll keep you sharp.

42
00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:30,853
I got a minor development.

43
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:33,772
- We lost the buyer.
- What do you mean, "lost"?

44
00:13:33,856 --> 00:13:37,568
Well, she's in a brass casket
six feet underground...

45
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,820
never to be heard from again.

46
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:42,823
Well, I fronted 20,000
in expenses.

47
00:13:42,865 --> 00:13:45,576
Now I'm due that,
plus 250 for my end.

48
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,661
You don't think I'm not
gonna take care of you?

49
00:13:47,703 --> 00:13:49,705
I'm not gonna cover
your expenses and all that?

50
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:53,375
It's not about covering my expenses.
It's the money. Find another buyer.

51
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,878
Of course. But Jesus Christ,
shit happens.

52
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:58,088
This thing's gonna drag out.
You've got to be patient.

53
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:02,134
Wait a minute.
How about this?

54
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:05,262
Four big ones
in your hand.

55
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,639
Four million dollars
in your mitt.

56
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:10,976
- Four million?
- More than you ever dreamed of.

57
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,937
More than we ever,
ever did together.

58
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:16,190
Four million.
What are you into?

59
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:19,484
Well, I spotted this item
which was really exceptional.

60
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:23,447
It was European antiquity,
elegant...

61
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,283
and it was in the hands
of this real dumb prick...

62
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,951
that didn't know what he had.

63
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:31,038
And unfortunately...

64
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:33,540
it's become detained
in transit a little.

65
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:39,129
You don't wanna know where?

66
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:40,923
It depends.

67
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:42,508
Depends on what?

68
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:45,594
- On what you're gonna tell me.
- Okay.

69
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:48,972
It's in the Montreal
Customshouse.

70
00:14:51,517 --> 00:14:55,229
- No way. I'm sorry.
- Oh, yeah. Wait a minute.

71
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:58,273
I got a guy--
I got a guy inside.

72
00:14:58,357 --> 00:15:02,778
He gives you the whole layout,
handles security, everything--

73
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:07,824
You used to tell me, "Steal outside
the country, in the States, Europe.

74
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:09,409
But Montreal,
live in Montreal."

75
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:12,120
I said a lot of dumb things
in my day, didn't I?

76
00:15:12,204 --> 00:15:13,497
- But that's--
- Right.

77
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:19,336
Let's just find another buyer
for this. I gotta open the place.

78
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:22,214
Okay, but I'm not finished
talking about this.

79
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:28,011
- Come on.
- You're making a large error here.

80
00:15:34,393 --> 00:15:36,311
Not bad.

81
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,992
- Yeah?
- I just landed.

82
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:51,994
I got the delivery.

83
00:16:14,016 --> 00:16:15,517
Got the bag?

84
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:18,395
- Yeah. Right here.
- Where's Johnny?

85
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:21,815
He got it in Istanbul,
right through the neck.

86
00:16:21,857 --> 00:16:24,109
- Jesus. He was a good kid.
- Yeah.

87
00:16:24,193 --> 00:16:25,903
Good and dead.

88
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:27,946
So you wanna talk,
or you wanna see what I got?

89
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:30,490
How can I be sure
you're okay?

90
00:16:31,867 --> 00:16:33,452
I suppose I could fuck you.

91
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:35,746
That would work.

92
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:59,478
Hey. You okay?

93
00:17:00,604 --> 00:17:02,105
Yeah. Great.

94
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:10,489
- How was your trip?
- I don't know.

95
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:13,450
Cities.

96
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:17,538
They're all starting to look
the same. They really are.

97
00:17:24,378 --> 00:17:27,840
And the pasta in Rome
is not as good as yours.

98
00:17:29,675 --> 00:17:31,593
And the ass pinchers.

99
00:17:31,677 --> 00:17:34,221
They used to look
so charmingly European.

100
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:36,223
Not as good as me?

101
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:42,688
Come on.

102
00:17:43,564 --> 00:17:45,858
It really must be
what it is about you I like...

103
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:48,402
because you most definitely
are not common.

104
00:17:54,867 --> 00:17:57,452
- What if I were?
- What if you were what?

105
00:17:57,536 --> 00:18:00,581
A little more common,
you know, and around more.

106
00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:02,583
How much more?

107
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,751
Like, "all the time" more.

108
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:07,212
And I was just a jazz club owner
and not that other thing.

109
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:08,630
How would you feel
about that?

110
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:13,677
Hey, are you saying
what I think you're saying?

111
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,305
I think that's
what I'm saying.

112
00:18:20,684 --> 00:18:24,980
Hey, baby, you know I've never
asked you to change anything for me.

113
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:28,150
I know that. I'm just asking you,
how would you feel about that?

114
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:37,826
I don't know.

115
00:18:40,162 --> 00:18:43,165
I suppose I'd have to give it
some serious thought.

116
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:48,086
Then you'd better start
giving it some serious thought.

117
00:18:57,763 --> 00:19:01,016
Thank you.
So I'll see you when I see you?

118
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:03,018
See you when I see you.

119
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,394
Excuse me.
Can you help me, please?

120
00:19:46,562 --> 00:19:48,647
Can you help me?

121
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,858
- Place Norman?
- Yes, yes.

122
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:53,443
You go to the corner,
make a right. Go two blocks--

123
00:19:53,527 --> 00:19:56,697
- Two.
- Two blocks, then a left one block.

124
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:59,283
- Again, please.
- Two blocks this way...

125
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:00,868
one block that way
to the left.

126
00:20:00,951 --> 00:20:03,495
- And you're right there.
- Okay, thank you.

127
00:20:03,579 --> 00:20:05,122
Thank you, Nick.

128
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:09,209
What did you say?

129
00:20:09,293 --> 00:20:11,795
I said, "Thank you, Nick."

130
00:20:14,173 --> 00:20:18,218
I'm Max's guy in the customshouse.
We should talk.

131
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:21,763
Okay, bye-bye. Thank you.

132
00:20:21,847 --> 00:20:23,765
Thank you. Bye.

133
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:32,608
- Where's Max?
- He's in the sunroom.

134
00:20:36,904 --> 00:20:39,323
Nicoli, Nicoli.

135
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:41,575
Have you lost
your fucking mind?

136
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:44,620
My mind? Years ago. Why?

137
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:47,623
- What did you tell this kid?
- What did I tell who?

138
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:49,666
Your inside guy
with the retard act.

139
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,835
He was in front of my house.
He knew who I was.

140
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:57,758
Wait. He must've followed me to
the club and made you from there.

141
00:20:57,841 --> 00:21:00,260
Tell him he pulls a stunt like that
again, he'll end up in the hospital.

142
00:21:00,344 --> 00:21:04,515
Wait. Do you think I'm gonna set
you up with a jerk-off heister?

143
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:07,893
You gotta admit that this kid did
a pretty good dog and pony show.

144
00:21:07,935 --> 00:21:11,772
I don't care who is he. Don't expose
me like that. You know better.

145
00:21:11,855 --> 00:21:13,315
He's got it all pre-wired.

146
00:21:13,398 --> 00:21:15,734
- You go in, turn the key--
- I told you, I'm not interested.

147
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:19,154
You're never gonna get another
chance at a score like this.

148
00:21:19,238 --> 00:21:21,198
- Why are you pushing this?
- Four million balls.

149
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:23,075
How many times
do I have to tell you?

150
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:24,868
He's pushing it
because we're running out of time.

151
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:28,705
If I'm gonna work
with a partner on this...

152
00:21:28,747 --> 00:21:30,624
we gotta start putting
our heads together right away.

153
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:32,167
- What are you doing in my house?
- Take it easy.

154
00:21:32,251 --> 00:21:34,962
- All I'm saying--
- Who the fuck is this kid?

155
00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:37,714
- What the fuck do you know?
- I've been on this for three weeks.

156
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:40,759
I gotta know if you're the guy
that Max says you are.

157
00:21:40,843 --> 00:21:44,012
- I gotta go.
- Nick, wait. Wait.

158
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:49,268
I didn't come 500 miles just to--
Jack Teller. Nice to meet you too.

159
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:50,269
What the fuck?

160
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:53,105
You're not smart enough
to know where your dick is.

161
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:56,358
We decided that you were gonna
sit tight until I called you.

162
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:57,776
- Is that correct?
- Okay.

163
00:21:57,818 --> 00:22:00,612
I thought I could help you sell him
on it. I thought he was already in.

164
00:22:00,696 --> 00:22:04,158
Don't be so fucking creative.
Just get the fuck out of my house.

165
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:07,828
When you guys get your shit
together, give me a call, okay?

166
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:09,163
Unbelievable.

167
00:22:13,584 --> 00:22:18,547
It's a lucky thing
you came my way

168
00:22:19,756 --> 00:22:21,925
Today

169
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:26,054
I'm about to tell you
something you should know

170
00:22:28,974 --> 00:22:32,978
All you have to do
is let the plot unfold

171
00:22:35,856 --> 00:22:38,317
Desire is clear

172
00:22:38,358 --> 00:22:40,027
When you are near

173
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,070
You're about to give in

174
00:22:45,157 --> 00:22:47,868
Don't tease me so

175
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:49,411
I think you know

176
00:22:49,495 --> 00:22:51,663
You're about to give in

177
00:22:54,249 --> 00:22:58,003
And if you listen
we can both find peace

178
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,216
Release

179
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:05,844
Inhibitions that you
thought could not be there

180
00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:16,790
Jesus!

181
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:19,793
God! Jesus! Take it easy.

182
00:24:21,253 --> 00:24:25,090
Listen close. Leave town
tonight. Don't come back.

183
00:24:25,132 --> 00:24:28,302
I see you again,
I break your fucking knees.

184
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:29,845
I see you around Nick,
I'll kill ya.

185
00:24:29,928 --> 00:24:32,973
It's a dangerous fucking game
you're playing here.

186
00:24:33,056 --> 00:24:34,725
Are we clear?

187
00:24:40,731 --> 00:24:42,649
Yeah, we're clear.

188
00:25:23,482 --> 00:25:25,526
How did it go?

189
00:25:25,609 --> 00:25:27,027
Not as planned.

190
00:25:27,903 --> 00:25:32,199
- What do you want?
- Some fucking respect for starters.

191
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:37,037
I mean, what are you thinking?
Now, I'm on a job here.

192
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,040
Now, if you just don't wanna come
in on it, that's fine. Say "no."

193
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:43,001
But don't send some third-rate
rent-a-thug to brush me off.

194
00:25:43,043 --> 00:25:44,711
You can do it
like a professional.

195
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:48,674
Hello.

196
00:25:49,967 --> 00:25:52,928
Yeah. You okay?

197
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:55,472
He's right here. Don't worry.
Just go home.

198
00:25:55,556 --> 00:25:58,767
I'll call you later, all right?
That's okay.

199
00:25:58,851 --> 00:26:00,269
Okay.

200
00:26:01,395 --> 00:26:03,564
I didn't come here
to cause any trouble.

201
00:26:03,647 --> 00:26:05,065
I didn't.

202
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:09,987
Coming up to you on the street
like that, that was a stupid move.

203
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:12,322
Sorry. Why don't we
just call it even?

204
00:26:12,406 --> 00:26:14,950
I just wanna say one thing to you,
then I'll go away.

205
00:26:15,033 --> 00:26:17,536
We don't have to bother each other
anymore if you don't want.

206
00:26:20,664 --> 00:26:23,709
I have been casing this place
for a couple of weeks now.

207
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:27,462
It's a little bit complicated,
but this is a very doable job.

208
00:26:27,546 --> 00:26:30,799
I can handle the system in there
if someone can break into this box.

209
00:26:32,593 --> 00:26:34,553
Look, I don't know you,
you don't know me.

210
00:26:34,595 --> 00:26:37,097
I know that's not
the best way to do things, but...

211
00:26:37,139 --> 00:26:39,766
I am very good
at what I do, okay?

212
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:43,604
And I take it very, very seriously.
You can check it out with Max.

213
00:26:43,687 --> 00:26:46,899
Now, if you are the guy
that he says you are...

214
00:26:46,982 --> 00:26:49,776
then we should check this out.

215
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,778
Just--Just take a look at it.

216
00:26:51,862 --> 00:26:54,781
That's all I'm saying,
'cause this is a very big payoff...

217
00:26:54,865 --> 00:26:56,783
for very acceptable risks.

218
00:27:03,457 --> 00:27:06,001
Just take a look at it.
Go look for yourself.

219
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:12,341
I like your place.

220
00:27:12,424 --> 00:27:14,343
You got good taste.

221
00:28:53,984 --> 00:28:56,695
Oh, Jesus.
It's nice and dark in here.

222
00:28:56,737 --> 00:28:58,780
Fucking everything.

223
00:29:01,742 --> 00:29:03,577
Jesus.

224
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,330
Why don't you jump
for some lights in this place?

225
00:29:06,413 --> 00:29:11,043
Every time I come in here,
it's like hide-and-go-seek.

226
00:29:11,084 --> 00:29:13,045
How are you?

227
00:29:24,723 --> 00:29:28,727
Now, you gotta tell me the--

228
00:29:28,769 --> 00:29:31,438
the magic word.

229
00:29:31,522 --> 00:29:33,357
All right, I'm gonna do it.

230
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,569
Good, good. Jesus, sweetheart.
You're a sweetheart.

231
00:29:37,653 --> 00:29:39,571
Bravo.
You're making sense.

232
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:44,618
But because of the risk involved,
my end's gotta be six million.

233
00:29:47,496 --> 00:29:48,705
Operator?

234
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:51,583
I got a nut down here
that just said six million.

235
00:29:52,918 --> 00:29:55,754
No, no. Send paramedics.
I think-- Are you all right?

236
00:29:55,838 --> 00:29:56,880
I'm fine.

237
00:29:56,964 --> 00:29:59,633
Six fucking million dollars?
What happened to four?

238
00:29:59,716 --> 00:30:03,345
I'm doing it in my backyard. I'm
not gonna go like that. I'm sorry.

239
00:30:03,428 --> 00:30:05,347
If you want me to do this,
you gotta pay me what's right.

240
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:08,475
- It's gotta be that way.
- I always pay you what's right.

241
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:11,812
You always think you do.
I always know what you pay me.

242
00:30:11,895 --> 00:30:14,648
It's not always right.
I need this for this.

243
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,693
I like your style.

244
00:30:17,776 --> 00:30:19,695
Yeah, well, okay.
I understand.

245
00:30:21,321 --> 00:30:24,533
That's what I have to do. I wanna
pay off the club, the mortgage.

246
00:30:24,616 --> 00:30:26,326
I wanna own this place
free and clear.

247
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:28,912
I want it to be mine.
I live the way I want.

248
00:30:28,996 --> 00:30:30,289
Because after this,
no more jobs.

249
00:30:30,372 --> 00:30:33,625
This is the last one I'm doing.
I'm quitting for good.

250
00:30:33,709 --> 00:30:36,420
How many times have you
told me that in 25 years?

251
00:30:36,461 --> 00:30:38,797
I'm gonna believe that
when the pigs eat my brother.

252
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:42,134
- Right?
- I'm done. I'm done. No more.

253
00:30:44,553 --> 00:30:47,973
Well, okay.
I hope she's worth it.

254
00:30:52,102 --> 00:30:54,021
Here's numb-nuts.

255
00:30:56,982 --> 00:30:59,818
Nice house, nice club.
You must be really good.

256
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:05,157
I don't wanna have to do this,
but raise your arms.

257
00:31:07,951 --> 00:31:10,871
- Be my guest.
- He's all right.

258
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:15,626
Okay?

259
00:31:22,716 --> 00:31:25,677
Is this a social call?
What are we doing here?

260
00:31:27,721 --> 00:31:29,306
I will explore this with you...

261
00:31:29,348 --> 00:31:32,184
but I run this operation
down to the smallest detail.

262
00:31:32,226 --> 00:31:35,521
If you have a problem with that,
we can all go home right now.

263
00:31:36,355 --> 00:31:37,981
Is there a problem with that?

264
00:31:39,107 --> 00:31:40,859
That's fine.

265
00:31:40,901 --> 00:31:43,987
You will tell me everything you
know, then I will design the plan.

266
00:31:44,029 --> 00:31:47,908
If I smell something about the job
or you that I don't like, I walk.

267
00:31:47,991 --> 00:31:51,078
If I think for one second you're
not living up to your end of it...

268
00:31:51,161 --> 00:31:53,914
or if you hold out on me
in any way, I walk.

269
00:31:53,997 --> 00:31:56,500
- Understood?
- That's fine.

270
00:31:56,542 --> 00:31:58,126
Tell me what you wanna know.

271
00:31:59,378 --> 00:32:03,423
- First, what are we looking for?
- You know what a scepter is?

272
00:32:03,507 --> 00:32:05,467
It's something
that a king holds.

273
00:32:06,593 --> 00:32:08,262
Right there.

274
00:32:08,345 --> 00:32:12,641
It was made in 1661 in France
for a special coronation...

275
00:32:13,851 --> 00:32:15,519
for a girl queen.

276
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:19,439
- It's priceless.
- Not to us, it's not.

277
00:32:19,523 --> 00:32:22,568
What can you give me
on its specific location?

278
00:32:22,651 --> 00:32:24,945
I can give you the whole
building, okay? I got floor plans.

279
00:32:25,028 --> 00:32:27,656
I've been clocking the security
patterns for over three weeks.

280
00:32:27,739 --> 00:32:29,867
All right.
Paint me a picture.

281
00:32:31,076 --> 00:32:33,745
Okay. He fixed me up
with the job.

282
00:32:33,829 --> 00:32:36,290
Not me but Brian,
the guy on the street.

283
00:32:36,373 --> 00:32:37,708
Yeah, I remember.

284
00:32:37,749 --> 00:32:40,586
Is he traceable? Phone number?
Address? That stuff?

285
00:32:40,669 --> 00:32:43,005
It's totally tight. The guy's
a charity case, a favor.

286
00:32:43,088 --> 00:32:45,090
The guy truly doesn't
even exist on paper.

287
00:32:45,174 --> 00:32:48,218
He just shows up.
He's the assistant janitor...

288
00:32:48,302 --> 00:32:50,053
midnight to 8 a.m.

289
00:32:55,434 --> 00:32:57,060
The security's pretty basic.

290
00:32:57,144 --> 00:32:59,605
At night, they lock the place down.
They bar the ground floor windows.

291
00:32:59,646 --> 00:33:03,233
You can only enter in through
one place, out by the truck court.

292
00:33:06,778 --> 00:33:09,448
Thank you, Hubert.
Thank you.

293
00:33:09,531 --> 00:33:12,242
Manpower's very light. They got one
guy sitting in a booth outside...

294
00:33:12,326 --> 00:33:14,703
just keeping an eye
on things.

295
00:33:16,371 --> 00:33:20,292
On the inside, everyone comes in
through a standard metal detector.

296
00:33:20,334 --> 00:33:24,421
It's tricky bringing things through,
but I've got that figured out.

297
00:33:24,463 --> 00:33:27,257
All the guards know me now,
so no one really looks too close.

298
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:29,635
- Okay, thank you.
- All right.

299
00:33:29,718 --> 00:33:32,054
Once I'm inside,
I can go anywhere I want.

300
00:33:32,137 --> 00:33:33,597
Hey, Laurent.

301
00:33:33,639 --> 00:33:37,351
Everything gets run from this
one little central command console.

302
00:33:37,434 --> 00:33:41,271
They've got fixed video systems in
the elevators and in the hallways.

303
00:33:41,313 --> 00:33:44,399
They got a couple magnetic doors,
but it's all very basic.

304
00:33:44,483 --> 00:33:48,070
Lots of overtime.
Not so much now.

305
00:33:48,153 --> 00:33:50,447
Now, the head janitor's
this old guy, Danny.

306
00:33:50,489 --> 00:33:52,866
He loves Brian.
Loves him.

307
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:55,327
I've got this guy completely
wrapped around my finger.

308
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:57,830
He'd do anything for me.

309
00:33:57,871 --> 00:33:59,915
And most of the time,
he's got me working with him.

310
00:33:59,998 --> 00:34:01,792
Kind of low-level shit,
just helping out.

311
00:34:01,834 --> 00:34:05,212
But I can get away from him plenty.
I got all kinds of reasons.

312
00:34:05,295 --> 00:34:08,757
I've sketched half the place
already. I've copied a lot of keys.

313
00:34:08,841 --> 00:34:12,010
I can get you access to basically
any room in the place.

314
00:34:12,094 --> 00:34:13,637
Where's the scepter?

315
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,598
Well, see, that's the kink.

316
00:34:16,682 --> 00:34:18,225
Now, get this.

317
00:34:18,308 --> 00:34:21,228
It was arranged to be
brought into the country...

318
00:34:21,311 --> 00:34:25,315
inside the leg
of an antique piano.

319
00:34:25,357 --> 00:34:29,153
And it was so simple.
Then they impounded it.

320
00:34:29,194 --> 00:34:31,196
I mean, can you guess why?

321
00:34:31,238 --> 00:34:34,074
Fucking bugs.

322
00:34:34,158 --> 00:34:37,661
I mean, the whole shipment
was contaminated with termites.

323
00:34:37,744 --> 00:34:39,705
Asian longhorn beetles.

324
00:34:40,789 --> 00:34:42,708
We got fucked by bugs.

325
00:34:45,169 --> 00:34:46,670
These things
burrow into the wood...

326
00:34:46,753 --> 00:34:48,630
so they were in the crates
of most of the shipment.

327
00:34:48,714 --> 00:34:51,175
So they took the goods out
and delivered most of them.

328
00:34:51,258 --> 00:34:54,052
But the piano is made of wood too,
so they impounded it.

329
00:34:54,136 --> 00:34:56,305
They took the whole thing
and put it in quarantine.

330
00:34:56,388 --> 00:34:59,016
Medium security,
third-floor lockup.

331
00:34:59,057 --> 00:35:00,642
They're really scared
of these things...

332
00:35:00,726 --> 00:35:02,394
and they can't send
them back to France.

333
00:35:05,063 --> 00:35:07,232
So they decided
to burn everything.

334
00:35:16,283 --> 00:35:18,243
Now, I'll tell ya...

335
00:35:18,285 --> 00:35:20,621
I didn't know which one of the
fucking legs this thing is in...

336
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:23,832
but half of me was tempted to grab
them all and make a break for it.

337
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:27,753
I mean, I don't know if this
thing's gonna melt or what.

338
00:35:28,921 --> 00:35:31,089
I mean, I was dying.

339
00:35:34,635 --> 00:35:36,970
I had to improvise a little.

340
00:35:41,683 --> 00:35:43,977
- I-I saw something in the fire.
- We're just burning stuff.

341
00:35:44,061 --> 00:35:48,273
No. Look, look.
I saw something in the--

342
00:35:48,357 --> 00:35:51,693
Piano. In the piano,
I saw a-- Look.

343
00:35:51,777 --> 00:35:52,861
- I saw something.
- Jack!

344
00:35:54,238 --> 00:35:56,365
There! There!

345
00:35:58,534 --> 00:36:00,452
What is it?

346
00:36:10,087 --> 00:36:11,755
So everybody's freaking out.

347
00:36:11,797 --> 00:36:13,882
Nobody knows what this is
or what to do with it.

348
00:36:13,966 --> 00:36:15,884
They don't see this kind
of excitement down there.

349
00:36:15,968 --> 00:36:17,970
So they call some supervisor.
They get him out of bed.

350
00:36:18,053 --> 00:36:20,472
He comes down,
he takes one look at this thing.

351
00:36:20,556 --> 00:36:23,684
He doesn't know what the hell it is,
but he knows it's worth a lot.

352
00:36:23,767 --> 00:36:26,770
He tells them, until they can
sort it out, put it in the basement.

353
00:36:27,563 --> 00:36:29,690
- And that's what they do.
- Don't worry. Don't worry.

354
00:36:29,731 --> 00:36:32,234
- Don't worry about it.
- I want to see, Danny.

355
00:36:32,317 --> 00:36:35,028
- Can I see?
- No. Come on. Let's go now.

356
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:37,531
Okay. Bye-bye. Bye.

357
00:36:53,005 --> 00:36:54,631
The basement
in the customshouse...

358
00:36:54,715 --> 00:36:57,009
is the most secure lockup
in eastern Canada.

359
00:36:57,092 --> 00:36:59,511
It was built as a bomb shelter
during the Cold War.

360
00:36:59,595 --> 00:37:03,056
All their important stuff's there--
state's evidence, narcotics...

361
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,892
confiscated weapons.

362
00:37:04,933 --> 00:37:07,728
That scepter is in a safe
somewhere in this room.

363
00:37:07,769 --> 00:37:09,813
But the thing is,
there's no-- there's no cameras.

364
00:37:09,897 --> 00:37:12,566
If there was, I would've seen
an angle on the video monitors.

365
00:37:12,649 --> 00:37:16,320
So if we can put you inside that
room, you can work on it all night.

366
00:37:18,489 --> 00:37:22,034
We'll need pictures of the safe
or a model number from their files.

367
00:37:22,117 --> 00:37:25,454
Then we're gonna need plans--
infrastructure maps...

368
00:37:25,537 --> 00:37:28,707
blueprints, schematics,
anything we can get our hands on.

369
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:30,667
That's all I got for now,
but give me two days.

370
00:37:30,751 --> 00:37:33,212
We just gotta find a way
to get into that basement.

371
00:38:15,671 --> 00:38:17,798
You gonna let it go, or are we gonna
drive around pissed all night?

372
00:38:17,881 --> 00:38:19,550
Why don't you kiss my ass?

373
00:38:44,324 --> 00:38:47,870
- We're about set up. You ready?
- Hold on.

374
00:39:04,678 --> 00:39:07,472
- Wanna give me a mark?
- Not yet. Not yet.

375
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,070
How you doing?

376
00:39:22,154 --> 00:39:24,615
Stay off the air
until I call.

377
00:39:48,597 --> 00:39:50,974
Three-three, two-six...

378
00:39:51,058 --> 00:39:53,435
two-nine, three-two.

379
00:39:53,477 --> 00:39:59,149
I repeat: 33, 26, 29, 32.

380
00:39:59,233 --> 00:40:03,320
Copy that. Three-three, two-six,
two-nine, three-two.

381
00:40:07,366 --> 00:40:11,119
Make a right.
Proceed east about 20 yards.

382
00:40:11,203 --> 00:40:13,121
You should see
the next opening.

383
00:40:21,755 --> 00:40:24,132
I'm at a wall here,
a cinder block wall...

384
00:40:24,216 --> 00:40:26,009
where you told me
I have to go.

385
00:40:26,093 --> 00:40:28,345
Are you sure about that?
It shows a straight shot on here.

386
00:40:28,428 --> 00:40:31,056
It's not my imagination.
I'm right here in front of it.

387
00:40:31,139 --> 00:40:33,517
You wanna come down here
and see for yourself?

388
00:40:34,977 --> 00:40:37,813
Right. Okay, okay. Hold on.

389
00:40:40,148 --> 00:40:42,067
All right,
just give me a second.

390
00:40:44,903 --> 00:40:47,823
- Can you read me?
- Make a left. Go about 20 feet.

391
00:40:47,865 --> 00:40:49,449
You should run
into a parallel tunnel.

392
00:40:49,533 --> 00:40:51,994
Make a right. You'll be
right back on course.

393
00:40:55,706 --> 00:40:58,500
Take the tunnel
about 150yards due west.

394
00:40:58,542 --> 00:41:00,836
You'll reach a "T" junction.
Tell me when you're there.

395
00:41:00,919 --> 00:41:02,337
About 300yards.

396
00:41:02,421 --> 00:41:05,299
- Came to the end. Made a right.
- Head Northwest.

397
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:07,134
Northeast.
Check that. Northeast.

398
00:41:07,176 --> 00:41:08,677
One second. Hold on.

399
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,806
- Are you with me?
- Going west. Going west.

400
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:17,686
- I'm going west. I'm in a circle.
- Make a right. Go 40yards east.

401
00:41:17,728 --> 00:41:21,690
Then make a left turn.
Go about--

402
00:41:21,773 --> 00:41:23,817
Make a right. Head back.

403
00:41:23,859 --> 00:41:26,320
You got maybe 500 yards to go.

404
00:41:33,577 --> 00:41:36,914
Straight ahead 20 feet, and you
should be dead under the room.

405
00:41:36,997 --> 00:41:38,582
The tunnel will keep on going.

406
00:41:38,665 --> 00:41:41,084
But look up.
You should see the access ladder.

407
00:41:47,674 --> 00:41:49,676
I'm at a shaft.
I'm gonna climb up.

408
00:42:01,897 --> 00:42:03,815
What are you doing?

409
00:42:04,566 --> 00:42:05,943
Still climbing.

410
00:42:26,922 --> 00:42:27,840
This looks like it.

411
00:44:01,892 --> 00:44:03,810
I'm done.

412
00:44:15,781 --> 00:44:17,699
What the hell is this?

413
00:44:23,497 --> 00:44:25,666
Hey, you got a utility crew
all over the entrance.

414
00:44:25,749 --> 00:44:27,668
You're gonna have to find
another way out.

415
00:45:01,952 --> 00:45:04,079
Where are you?

416
00:45:11,044 --> 00:45:13,422
I'm at De La Montagne
and Ottawa.

417
00:45:13,505 --> 00:45:15,507
Repeat:
De La Montagne and Ottawa.

418
00:45:15,549 --> 00:45:17,509
Got it. We're on our way.

419
00:45:24,349 --> 00:45:26,268
This should be it,
right here.

420
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:30,397
We're here.
I'm just trying to find you.

421
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,900
There. He's right over there.

422
00:45:55,255 --> 00:45:57,049
Okay, you're all clear.

423
00:45:57,090 --> 00:45:59,051
I'm coming out.

424
00:46:43,428 --> 00:46:44,847
Hello.

425
00:46:46,473 --> 00:46:48,433
Anybody home?

426
00:47:07,494 --> 00:47:09,746
- Champagne.
- Yeah.

427
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:11,999
- Nice touch.
- Nice dress.

428
00:47:12,082 --> 00:47:13,917
You like? Thank you.

429
00:47:16,253 --> 00:47:20,924
So, you asked me a question
a couple of days ago.

430
00:47:21,008 --> 00:47:23,468
And you gave it
some serious thought?

431
00:47:24,428 --> 00:47:26,346
Actually,
I forgot the question.

432
00:47:28,807 --> 00:47:31,310
Here's my answer.

433
00:47:31,393 --> 00:47:32,895
You're not holding up
your glass.

434
00:47:32,978 --> 00:47:34,313
I'm sorry.

435
00:47:36,607 --> 00:47:39,318
My father was a lawyer--
very smart man--

436
00:47:39,401 --> 00:47:42,738
and he would always say
that a deal is only good...

437
00:47:42,821 --> 00:47:46,658
if it leaves both parties feeling
as if they gave up something.

438
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:49,912
Is an answer coming soon?
'Cause the glass is getting heavy.

439
00:47:51,997 --> 00:47:53,415
Okay.

440
00:47:54,583 --> 00:47:56,710
I will change my life...

441
00:47:56,793 --> 00:47:58,712
I will move here...

442
00:48:00,547 --> 00:48:01,882
I will love you...

443
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:07,679
and believe that this is
the best decision that I've made.

444
00:48:09,431 --> 00:48:12,476
But I will not move here
if it means that one day...

445
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:14,269
I might have to talk
to you through glass.

446
00:48:14,353 --> 00:48:16,772
I won't move here if it means
spending my nights worrying.

447
00:48:16,855 --> 00:48:22,402
So if you can promise me, as of
right now, that you're through...

448
00:48:23,654 --> 00:48:26,698
then we can drink
to making changes.

449
00:48:35,082 --> 00:48:38,043
I-- I said you could drink now.

450
00:48:38,085 --> 00:48:39,169
I know.

451
00:48:39,253 --> 00:48:41,797
I wanna do all that.

452
00:48:43,423 --> 00:48:47,719
I just have to tell you
that I'm gonna do one more thing...

453
00:48:47,761 --> 00:48:49,888
- and that's it.
- Oh, fuck.

454
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:52,432
Everything you said is great.
It's perfect.

455
00:48:52,474 --> 00:48:55,769
I just have one more thing
I have to do.

456
00:48:55,853 --> 00:48:58,522
You put that out there when you
knew you couldn't follow through.

457
00:48:58,605 --> 00:49:01,441
I put it out there because--
I am following through.

458
00:49:01,483 --> 00:49:03,443
- This is my last one. I promise.
- Sure it is.

459
00:49:03,527 --> 00:49:05,571
I promise you
it is my last one.

460
00:49:05,612 --> 00:49:08,282
Then quit. Quit now.

461
00:49:08,365 --> 00:49:11,451
- What does "one last one" mean?
- It means we don't need anything.

462
00:49:11,535 --> 00:49:15,414
I didn't need anything before,
and I don't need anything now...

463
00:49:15,455 --> 00:49:17,708
but what I wanted
was to be with you.

464
00:49:17,791 --> 00:49:21,336
And what I didn't need was exactly
this kind of painful bullshit.

465
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:25,966
My life wasn't perfect before,
but at least we were clear.

466
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:29,720
Give me some--

467
00:49:32,014 --> 00:49:33,974
I'll see you when I see you.

468
00:50:45,045 --> 00:50:47,339
Hey, what are you doing?

469
00:50:47,422 --> 00:50:50,175
Somebody put fingerprints
on my window, Danny.

470
00:50:50,259 --> 00:50:53,512
- You don't need to do it.
- I like a clean window, Danny.

471
00:50:53,595 --> 00:50:54,805
It's all right.

472
00:50:54,888 --> 00:50:58,058
We missed you last night.
You feeling better?

473
00:50:58,141 --> 00:50:59,601
- Yes, thank you.
- Sure?

474
00:50:59,685 --> 00:51:00,894
Yes, I'm okay.
Thank you, Danny.

475
00:51:00,978 --> 00:51:04,606
- Take your time. Okay, bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

476
00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:05,774
Bye.

477
00:51:22,833 --> 00:51:24,751
That's your safe.

478
00:51:29,965 --> 00:51:33,051
Traeger standing jeweler's safe,
this year's model.

479
00:51:33,135 --> 00:51:36,388
If it's new, it's gonna be tough
to get the schematics.

480
00:51:36,471 --> 00:51:38,473
I've got all
this year's books.

481
00:51:38,515 --> 00:51:40,934
- Really?
- Yeah. What else?

482
00:51:41,018 --> 00:51:44,271
Okay, the system's
Ironclad Security.

483
00:51:44,354 --> 00:51:45,981
They're a big commercial
industrial outfit.

484
00:51:46,023 --> 00:51:48,358
They handle a lot
of the government buildings here.

485
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,528
Now, this building's pretty old.
The lines are all over the place.

486
00:51:51,612 --> 00:51:54,615
They're easy to find. I can cut in
three or four different places...

487
00:51:54,698 --> 00:51:58,410
and let you in from there, but I
need the engineering pass codes.

488
00:51:58,494 --> 00:52:00,037
I've been looking.
They don't keep them in here.

489
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:03,457
They'll be at Ironclad.
I don't know what to do.

490
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:04,833
Okay.

491
00:52:06,502 --> 00:52:08,420
What, are you
calling someone now?

492
00:52:12,674 --> 00:52:15,469
- What? Who is this?
- It's me. Turn down the music.

493
00:52:18,222 --> 00:52:20,474
Hey, Nick, I am fucked up.

494
00:52:20,557 --> 00:52:22,893
My mother's totally
out of control.

495
00:52:22,976 --> 00:52:24,603
Listen. Listen carefully.

496
00:52:24,686 --> 00:52:26,355
Ironclad Security.

497
00:52:26,438 --> 00:52:28,482
- Big outfit.
- Yeah.

498
00:52:28,565 --> 00:52:31,068
I need engineering pass codes
for the customshouse.

499
00:52:31,151 --> 00:52:33,195
I don't know, man.
my concentration's shot.

500
00:52:33,237 --> 00:52:36,532
I haven't slept in, like, a month.
Wait. What customshouse?

501
00:52:37,241 --> 00:52:38,367
Montreal.

502
00:52:40,577 --> 00:52:42,287
You're not pissing
in our own pool, man.

503
00:52:42,371 --> 00:52:44,957
You have always said you were never
gonna do a job here in Montreal.

504
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,709
- I know. I know. Can you do it?
- Steven!

505
00:52:47,751 --> 00:52:49,586
Who are you talking to
at this hour?

506
00:52:49,628 --> 00:52:53,799
I am having a fucking conversation
with a friend of mine, Mother!

507
00:52:54,591 --> 00:52:58,095
- Are you-- Are you okay?
- She is a ghoul.

508
00:52:58,178 --> 00:53:00,597
Now, tell me
exactly what you want.

509
00:53:00,681 --> 00:53:04,643
Just one second. Here's someone
who can tell you what we need.

510
00:53:04,726 --> 00:53:07,104
Just tell him what you need.

511
00:53:07,187 --> 00:53:10,440
I need separate disarm and reset
master codes for the whole system...

512
00:53:10,482 --> 00:53:12,860
and I need the individual
sector bypass codes...

513
00:53:12,943 --> 00:53:16,530
so I can shut down one zone without
lighting off the whole board.

514
00:53:16,613 --> 00:53:18,657
- Okay?
- Yes.

515
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:21,910
- You got that?
- Got it.

516
00:53:21,994 --> 00:53:24,580
Now, listen, I'm gonna
need this within 48 hours.

517
00:53:24,621 --> 00:53:26,456
If you do that,
I'll double your last price.

518
00:53:27,416 --> 00:53:30,127
Dude, give me a Kaypro 64
and a live dial tone...

519
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:32,462
and I can do anything.

520
00:53:34,423 --> 00:53:37,342
Oh, now you are going to die.

521
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:41,263
This is someone
you work with?

522
00:53:41,305 --> 00:53:43,557
And you're giving me
a hard time.

523
00:54:14,505 --> 00:54:17,966
Thursday, 8:07a.m.

524
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:21,011
Hi. I got your message.
One of the stewardesses is sick...

525
00:54:21,094 --> 00:54:24,223
so I have to cover for her
on a New York run.

526
00:54:24,306 --> 00:54:27,142
We have to talk when I come
through in a couple of days.

527
00:54:27,184 --> 00:54:29,144
Okay?Bye.

528
00:54:30,354 --> 00:54:32,272
End of messages.

529
00:54:42,282 --> 00:54:44,952
Just lock it.

530
00:54:45,035 --> 00:54:48,455
- You work here?
- No. Here.

531
00:54:56,463 --> 00:54:58,507
Come on.

532
00:54:58,590 --> 00:55:00,551
Come on.
Come on in.

533
00:55:16,316 --> 00:55:18,235
Want some coffee?

534
00:55:23,782 --> 00:55:27,452
Jeez. Is this
what we're dealing with?

535
00:55:31,832 --> 00:55:33,709
Page 720.

536
00:55:38,172 --> 00:55:43,218
- Where can I get one of these?
- You gotta know the right people.

537
00:55:43,302 --> 00:55:46,180
Traeger floor safe.
Here it is.

538
00:55:46,972 --> 00:55:49,892
Solid steel body.

539
00:55:49,975 --> 00:55:52,352
Filled door
with aluminum and cobalt.

540
00:55:53,270 --> 00:55:56,315
Half-inch hard plate.
Double dial.

541
00:55:58,150 --> 00:56:00,319
You're gonna need two,
three hours to drill through that.

542
00:56:00,402 --> 00:56:03,197
- You can't drill this.
- Why not?

543
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:06,575
'Cause this is a newer model
and it's got these glass packs.

544
00:56:06,658 --> 00:56:09,953
See the glass pack here? See?

545
00:56:10,037 --> 00:56:13,207
Drill through that, the glass breaks
and those bolts spring into place.

546
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:15,042
You're fucked. They're locked.
Forget it.

547
00:56:15,083 --> 00:56:17,377
You can't break it
with a bulldozer.

548
00:56:17,419 --> 00:56:20,047
I've never seen anything like that.
What do you have in mind?

549
00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:23,175
I don't know, but if somebody
built it, somebody can unbuild it.

550
00:56:34,228 --> 00:56:37,231
Yeah, see, when I shut this down,
you'll see this light go off...

551
00:56:37,272 --> 00:56:39,817
but up in the booth,
nothing will register.

552
00:56:43,153 --> 00:56:45,781
- Is that your box?
- That's it.

553
00:56:45,864 --> 00:56:47,866
That's a fucking monster.
That's three times the size of this.

554
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:49,535
Even bigger than that.

555
00:56:49,576 --> 00:56:52,871
See that over there?

556
00:56:52,913 --> 00:56:55,916
You can see it better over here.

557
00:56:55,999 --> 00:56:59,044
That's an active infrared post.

558
00:56:59,086 --> 00:57:01,171
I don't know.
That wasn't on the system specs.

559
00:57:01,255 --> 00:57:04,675
That's gotta be some independent
loop they set up just in the cage.

560
00:57:05,634 --> 00:57:07,594
I'll take care of it.

561
00:57:13,642 --> 00:57:18,689
All right, just calm down, okay?
I'll be over in a few minutes.

562
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:22,109
I gotta take care of something.
I'll drop you off.

563
00:57:47,259 --> 00:57:49,469
My mom's only out
for about a half an hour.

564
00:57:54,725 --> 00:57:58,187
I was cruising around Ironclad's
server at the root COBOL level...

565
00:57:58,270 --> 00:58:03,192
when someone counter-cracked me,
hacked into my machines, my data.

566
00:58:03,275 --> 00:58:05,110
For three minutes,
I was fully exposed.

567
00:58:05,194 --> 00:58:09,531
Now I have to fire wall my whole
operations all from scratch.

568
00:58:09,615 --> 00:58:13,160
- Can you tell me that in English?
- Sorry.

569
00:58:13,243 --> 00:58:16,121
I was a few keystrokes away from
pulling those engineering codes...

570
00:58:16,205 --> 00:58:18,332
when I bump into a guy
on the other end.

571
00:58:18,415 --> 00:58:21,251
- And what's on the other end?
- Ironclad's computers.

572
00:58:21,293 --> 00:58:23,462
My guess is he's some
low-level systems administrator.

573
00:58:23,545 --> 00:58:28,675
So, we switch to a private
chat room, and he sends me this.

574
00:58:30,594 --> 00:58:31,512
Can you believe that?

575
00:58:31,595 --> 00:58:34,765
The guy comes into my world
and calls me an asshole.

576
00:58:34,806 --> 00:58:37,893
- Can you get me the bypass codes?
- I type, " How much?" He types...

577
00:58:37,976 --> 00:58:39,770
" Engineering codes for
the customshouse basement?"

578
00:58:39,853 --> 00:58:41,939
I say, "You guessed it,
Blue's Clues."

579
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:44,066
And he says, " Fuck you."
And I say, " No, fuck you."

580
00:58:44,149 --> 00:58:46,819
And he says, " No, fuck you."
I'm like, " No, fuck you."

581
00:58:46,902 --> 00:58:48,821
Then he's like, " No, fuck--"

582
00:58:48,862 --> 00:58:51,406
Can you get me the bypass codes?

583
00:58:52,658 --> 00:58:56,453
The guy wants 50 thou
in exchange for the codes.

584
00:58:56,537 --> 00:58:59,456
- Fifty thousand.
- Yes.

585
00:59:02,125 --> 00:59:03,544
Get the account number.

586
00:59:03,627 --> 00:59:05,712
I'll wire the money, and he'll
deliver the codes through you.

587
00:59:05,796 --> 00:59:07,297
Negative.
The guy won't go for a transfer.

588
00:59:07,381 --> 00:59:09,800
He wants cash
and he wants to do it in person.

589
00:59:11,134 --> 00:59:12,845
- Anything else?
- No.

590
00:59:12,928 --> 00:59:15,889
You set it up.
I'll let myself out.

591
00:59:15,973 --> 00:59:19,017
When this score's done, I'm gonna
brute this creep with everything.

592
00:59:19,101 --> 00:59:22,729
By the time I'm done with this fuck,
he won't be able to hide in Bolivia!

593
00:59:51,383 --> 00:59:54,511
Jesus.
Look at all these people.

594
00:59:54,553 --> 00:59:57,472
Who sets up a meeting
in a public park?

595
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:04,354
- You see him?
- Still looking.

596
01:00:19,369 --> 01:00:22,789
Got him.
He brought backup.

597
01:00:24,416 --> 01:00:26,418
Okay, I got him.

598
01:00:39,264 --> 01:00:42,059
Hey, how ya doing?
Good to see ya.

599
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:45,187
Shake my hand. That's right.
You my guy?

600
01:00:45,270 --> 01:00:46,480
Yeah.

601
01:00:46,563 --> 01:00:49,691
- Who's this?
- Cousin.

602
01:00:49,775 --> 01:00:53,403
Cousin? Okay. See the guy
over my left shoulder...

603
01:00:53,445 --> 01:00:58,659
back there on the bench,
reading the paper, the big one?

604
01:00:58,742 --> 01:01:02,287
That's my cousin, okay?

605
01:01:02,371 --> 01:01:06,416
So we've all got family here,
which is nice, I think. Yeah? Okay.

606
01:01:06,458 --> 01:01:10,963
Let me give you that. Look inside
and make sure you're happy.

607
01:01:15,634 --> 01:01:16,927
No, don't take that out.

608
01:01:17,010 --> 01:01:20,097
Hey, man, don't give me orders.
I get orders all day, okay?

609
01:01:20,138 --> 01:01:22,266
Can't count the money
in a public place.

610
01:01:22,307 --> 01:01:24,601
That's why you don't
set a meeting in a park.

611
01:01:24,685 --> 01:01:26,520
Just for future reference.

612
01:01:27,646 --> 01:01:29,773
Just flip through it in the bag.

613
01:01:31,316 --> 01:01:33,569
We're about set to go here.
You ready?

614
01:01:33,652 --> 01:01:34,820
What the fuck is that?

615
01:01:34,903 --> 01:01:37,781
He's gonna give me the numbers, and
I'm gonna read 'em into this mike...

616
01:01:37,823 --> 01:01:39,825
to a friend of mine
who's gonna check 'em out.

617
01:01:43,328 --> 01:01:45,622
Did you think I was gonna
write it down on a cocktail napkin?

618
01:01:46,415 --> 01:01:49,459
- Okay, ready.
- Okay, you're on.

619
01:01:51,295 --> 01:01:54,965
First set: 3-1-7.

620
01:01:55,048 --> 01:01:58,135
- 3-1-7.
- Got it. 3-1-7.

621
01:01:58,177 --> 01:02:02,472
Steven, 3-1-7.

622
01:02:02,556 --> 01:02:05,100
Confirm 3-1-7.

623
01:02:10,189 --> 01:02:14,943
Just be a second.
Are you guys maternal cousins?

624
01:02:28,957 --> 01:02:31,752
- First numbers are clean.
- They're clean. They're clean.

625
01:02:31,835 --> 01:02:34,087
You tell the hack
at the other end of that wire...

626
01:02:34,171 --> 01:02:36,965
he tries to get in my system again,
I will fry him, okay?

627
01:02:37,049 --> 01:02:38,884
Why don't we worry about
next time next time, okay?

628
01:02:38,967 --> 01:02:41,011
Let's get this done before
people start looking at us.

629
01:02:41,053 --> 01:02:44,181
- Give me the second set.
- 9-4-6.

630
01:02:44,264 --> 01:02:47,184
- 9-4-6.
- 9-4-6.

631
01:02:47,226 --> 01:02:51,313
Repeat: 9-4-6. 9-4-6.

632
01:02:58,070 --> 01:03:01,031
- Take it easy. Relax. Have a smoke.
- I don't smoke.

633
01:03:01,073 --> 01:03:05,160
Me either, so good for us.
You guys local? You live here?

634
01:03:05,244 --> 01:03:07,955
Why are you asking
so many fucking questions?

635
01:03:13,293 --> 01:03:16,547
- They're good.
- Second set is good.

636
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:18,131
What's the third one?

637
01:03:20,467 --> 01:03:22,427
5-8-3-9.

638
01:03:22,469 --> 01:03:24,680
5-8-3-9.

639
01:03:24,763 --> 01:03:27,224
5-8-3-9. Got it.

640
01:03:27,307 --> 01:03:30,811
5-8-3-9.

641
01:03:40,279 --> 01:03:42,573
This is taking too long.
I'm gonna fucking lose it.

642
01:03:42,614 --> 01:03:44,449
Shut up, Eric.

643
01:03:44,533 --> 01:03:47,703
They have to verify the numbers
off the server. It takes some time.

644
01:03:47,786 --> 01:03:49,288
Just relax, Eric.

645
01:03:52,833 --> 01:03:54,751
Can you help me out? It's turning
into amateur hour out here.

646
01:03:54,793 --> 01:03:57,504
- Fuck you, asshole.
- What are you doing?

647
01:03:57,588 --> 01:03:59,089
One of them has a gun.

648
01:03:59,173 --> 01:04:01,258
Burt, big guy's got a gun.

649
01:04:01,341 --> 01:04:03,093
Steven, how's it going?
We're losing these guys.

650
01:04:03,177 --> 01:04:06,096
- I'm working it, man.
- Steven, want some lunch?

651
01:04:06,138 --> 01:04:08,515
I'm on the phone, bitch!

652
01:04:08,599 --> 01:04:09,766
- You all right?
- We're fine.

653
01:04:09,850 --> 01:04:14,688
Don't anybody move.
Eric, look at my hand right now.

654
01:04:16,523 --> 01:04:20,360
If you take that out, I'm gonna take
this out, be a big fucking mess.

655
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:22,946
Put it away, Eric.

656
01:04:22,988 --> 01:04:25,115
There's kids all around.
What are you thinking?

657
01:04:25,199 --> 01:04:30,078
Put it away. Take a deep breath
and just put it in your back pocket.

658
01:04:30,162 --> 01:04:32,372
Put it away.

659
01:04:36,043 --> 01:04:38,545
- They're all good.
- Last set of numbers confirmed.

660
01:04:38,629 --> 01:04:40,631
Last set of numbers confirmed.
Let's get out of here.

661
01:04:51,225 --> 01:04:52,684
Next time, don't bring a gun.

662
01:04:52,726 --> 01:04:56,438
Listen, I thought
I might need one, and I did.

663
01:04:56,522 --> 01:04:58,649
- Now we've got the codes.
- Don't bring a gun.

664
01:05:07,741 --> 01:05:10,953
I called. They said you hadn't
checked in yet. No.

665
01:05:16,083 --> 01:05:18,418
So what time you getting in?

666
01:05:20,796 --> 01:05:23,090
Come on, honey.
Don't stay at a hotel.

667
01:05:23,173 --> 01:05:25,717
Just come over to my place.
I'll cook some--

668
01:05:37,646 --> 01:05:39,231
Yeah. Yeah.

669
01:05:39,314 --> 01:05:41,733
I was just saying come to my place.
I'll cook something.

670
01:05:41,775 --> 01:05:43,819
You know, we'll talk, okay?

671
01:05:47,906 --> 01:05:50,701
I'm thinking 'bout a place

672
01:05:50,784 --> 01:05:53,453
I'm waiting for the day

673
01:05:53,537 --> 01:05:57,958
When I will make my getaway

674
01:05:59,084 --> 01:06:02,212
Because as any fool can see

675
01:06:02,296 --> 01:06:04,756
There's nothing here for me

676
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:08,552
But hurry up, boy
bring that water

677
01:06:08,635 --> 01:06:11,054
Don't do things
you shouldn't oughta

678
01:06:11,138 --> 01:06:13,015
He's good.

679
01:06:14,808 --> 01:06:17,644
When you gotta be there?

680
01:06:17,728 --> 01:06:21,773
I'll go in in a couple hours.
I'm okay. I'm doing fine.

681
01:06:23,150 --> 01:06:25,986
Listen, tell me something.
Tell me something.

682
01:06:26,028 --> 01:06:28,280
All the years
you've been doing this...

683
01:06:28,322 --> 01:06:30,699
what's the biggest gamble
you ever took?

684
01:06:30,782 --> 01:06:34,453
On the job.
You know, biggest long shot.

685
01:06:34,536 --> 01:06:36,747
I don't take long shots.

686
01:06:36,830 --> 01:06:39,333
I know you're careful.
You know, I'm careful too.

687
01:06:39,416 --> 01:06:42,002
That's not what I mean.
I mean--

688
01:06:42,085 --> 01:06:44,630
When you were starting out,
when you were just getting going...

689
01:06:44,671 --> 01:06:47,549
you must have taken
some fliers here and there.

690
01:06:47,633 --> 01:06:49,718
Done something that was
a little wild. I'm just curious.

691
01:06:49,801 --> 01:06:51,637
Never took long shots.

692
01:06:55,474 --> 01:06:57,059
I'm gonna say something to you.

693
01:06:57,142 --> 01:06:59,228
You're smart, you're talented
and you know a few things...

694
01:06:59,311 --> 01:07:02,481
but talent means nothing
if you don't make the right choices.

695
01:07:02,564 --> 01:07:05,984
There's talented people out there
who never see daylight anymore.

696
01:07:06,026 --> 01:07:08,278
Last thing, it takes discipline...

697
01:07:08,362 --> 01:07:10,322
because this whole game
is one big long shot...

698
01:07:10,405 --> 01:07:12,658
and if you don't have the discipline
to stay away from the fliers...

699
01:07:12,699 --> 01:07:15,702
or from the gambles or whatever else
you wanna call a stupid move...

700
01:07:15,786 --> 01:07:19,039
then, my friend, I'm afraid to say,
one day you will go down.

701
01:07:19,122 --> 01:07:20,624
It's inevitable.

702
01:07:21,416 --> 01:07:23,710
You want my advice?
