1
00:00:45,832 --> 00:00:49,624
I'M YOUR MAN

2
00:00:51,082 --> 00:00:53,124
Welcome.
-Hello.

3
00:01:00,499 --> 00:01:02,332
Dr. Felser.

4
00:01:02,499 --> 00:01:04,540
Please follow me.

5
00:01:29,457 --> 00:01:31,582
Hi, Alma. I'm Tom.

6
00:01:34,289 --> 00:01:36,624
Nice to meet you, Alma.

7
00:01:37,332 --> 00:01:39,289
Shall we sit down?

8
00:01:44,414 --> 00:01:46,749
What can I bring you to drink?

9
00:01:47,124 --> 00:01:49,289
The Bordeaux is a real treat.

10
00:01:50,289 --> 00:01:52,332
Bordeaux for the lady?

11
00:01:58,124 --> 00:02:00,665
You're a very beautiful woman, Alma.

12
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:06,749
Your eyes are like two mountain lakes
I could sink into.

13
00:02:19,082 --> 00:02:20,499
Tom, right?

14
00:02:20,832 --> 00:02:22,915
Don't you like compliments?

15
00:02:23,457 --> 00:02:25,457
Do you believe in God?

16
00:02:25,707 --> 00:02:28,957
This is hardly the place
to discuss such a question.

17
00:02:29,999 --> 00:02:33,582
Do you have a favorite poem?
-I particularly like Rilke.

18
00:02:33,874 --> 00:02:35,957
Autumn Day, for example.

19
00:02:36,124 --> 00:02:37,790
Sixth and seventh lines?

20
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:43,249
"Press them to ripeness, and chase
The last sweetness into the heavy wine."

21
00:02:43,582 --> 00:02:46,499
Second to last letter of the poem?
-E.

22
00:02:49,207 --> 00:02:53,082
What is the meaning of life?
-To make the world a better place.

23
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,290
3,587 times 982, divided by 731?

24
00:02:58,749 --> 00:03:01,665
4,818.65116.

25
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,790
What is the saddest thing
you can think of.

26
00:03:12,749 --> 00:03:14,790
Dying alone.

27
00:03:19,957 --> 00:03:22,415
Shall we dance? Rumba!

28
00:03:29,207 --> 00:03:32,749
I suggest you take advantage
of the opportunity, Dr. Felser.

29
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,207
You will be amazed.

30
00:04:25,415 --> 00:04:27,374
Am I doing something wrong?

31
00:04:30,665 --> 00:04:32,665
I am... I am...

32
00:04:33,165 --> 00:04:34,540
I am... I am...

33
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,665
Please excuse this complication.

34
00:05:10,999 --> 00:05:14,249
But I assure you,
it's extremely rare with this model.

35
00:05:14,582 --> 00:05:17,457
As rare as winning the lottery.

36
00:05:17,624 --> 00:05:19,790
I mean, in terms of probability.

37
00:05:20,165 --> 00:05:24,707
I assure you, our technicians will have
everything in order by tomorrow night.

38
00:05:25,082 --> 00:05:27,999
We are so sorry
for this unpleasant delay.

39
00:05:28,624 --> 00:05:30,499
No problem.

40
00:05:42,915 --> 00:05:46,165
You have no idea
how hard it is to program flirting.

41
00:05:46,332 --> 00:05:50,124
One false move, one misleading glance,
one careless remark,

42
00:05:50,457 --> 00:05:53,790
and the romance evaporates.
Am I right?

43
00:05:55,499 --> 00:05:59,082
This whole setting might seem
a bit extravagant,

44
00:05:59,582 --> 00:06:04,874
but this romantic encounter gives us
valuable input for the final adjustments.

45
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:10,665
And even though you're one of ten experts
testing Tom for just three weeks,

46
00:06:10,832 --> 00:06:15,124
the atmosphere of your first encounter
is of utmost importance.

47
00:06:17,582 --> 00:06:20,874
That's a lot of effort.
-Not as much as you think.

48
00:06:26,332 --> 00:06:27,707
Holograms.

49
00:06:27,874 --> 00:06:30,874
They're cheaper
and they can dance longer.

50
00:06:41,915 --> 00:06:46,082
I know you see this
with a certain emotional detachment,

51
00:06:46,249 --> 00:06:49,165
which you should as a test person,

52
00:06:49,332 --> 00:06:54,040
but I highly recommend that you
open yourself up to this experience.

53
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:57,915
When happiness knocks at your door,
you should open it.

54
00:06:58,082 --> 00:06:59,915
Tomorrow's the big day.

55
00:07:00,082 --> 00:07:03,457
Everything will be configured,
and you can take Tom home.

56
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:04,832
Okay, thanks.

57
00:07:41,499 --> 00:07:43,707
Hello, Juliane.
-Hello, Alma.

58
00:07:49,457 --> 00:07:52,415
Sorry, I got held up.
You don't want to know.

59
00:07:52,582 --> 00:07:56,790
I have to go again in a second, too.
Is scan 2202 done?

60
00:07:56,957 --> 00:07:59,040
Yes, it's on the desk.

61
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,999
There's not much time left.
It's the final sprint.

62
00:08:13,207 --> 00:08:14,915
See you tomorrow.
-See you.

63
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:22,124
They test me, scan my brain,
give me non-stop surveys,

64
00:08:22,457 --> 00:08:24,582
then they feed those things

65
00:08:24,749 --> 00:08:27,999
with so-called mind files
from 17 million people:

66
00:08:28,165 --> 00:08:30,457
traits, views, feelings...

67
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:34,164
It's super complex,
and God knows how much it costs.

68
00:08:34,499 --> 00:08:36,664
And what's the result?

69
00:08:37,332 --> 00:08:40,832
"Your eyes are like two mountain lakes
I could sink into."

70
00:08:43,624 --> 00:08:46,915
Maybe they know you
better than you know yourself.

71
00:08:47,749 --> 00:08:50,332
I'd love to try it.

72
00:08:50,665 --> 00:08:54,040
Have your dream girl built for you?
-Yeah.

73
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:58,082
But I've already got her at home.
All joking aside.

74
00:08:59,582 --> 00:09:01,749
Regardless of our opinion,

75
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:05,415
I'm on the ethics committee
and I need your evaluation.

76
00:09:05,915 --> 00:09:08,790
I've seen enough to write it.
-Alma, this is about

77
00:09:09,124 --> 00:09:12,624
whether these things
will be allowed to marry, to work,

78
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:17,124
to get passports, human rights,
or partial human rights or...

79
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:19,874
Roger, I...

80
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,749
Oh, I didn't know that...

81
00:09:23,915 --> 00:09:26,124
Sorry. Hello, Alma.

82
00:09:27,915 --> 00:09:29,457
Hello, Julian.

83
00:09:29,665 --> 00:09:31,290
Um, it...

84
00:09:31,499 --> 00:09:34,082
It's not urgent. I'll come back.

85
00:09:34,749 --> 00:09:37,040
Okay, see you later.

86
00:09:37,624 --> 00:09:41,040
Why can't Julian do it?
-Being single is a prerequisite.

87
00:09:41,499 --> 00:09:42,915
And Frank?
-Alma.

88
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:46,124
Everyone either has a family
or a partner.

89
00:09:46,457 --> 00:09:50,207
You agreed to this,
and your thing, your dream partner,

90
00:09:51,082 --> 00:09:54,874
has already been built for you.
It's just three weeks.

91
00:09:55,540 --> 00:10:00,957
Then you and your crew can fly to Chicago
and see the cuneiform tablets in person.

92
00:10:01,124 --> 00:10:03,040
I'll allocate the funds.

93
00:10:03,582 --> 00:10:05,624
No, no, it's not a bribe.

94
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:08,124
Just a little thank you.

95
00:10:15,499 --> 00:10:18,457
Long time no see. Where have you been?
-Here and there.

96
00:10:18,624 --> 00:10:21,665
A convention in Copenhagen, the museum...

97
00:10:21,999 --> 00:10:23,999
Hi, Alma!
-Hi, Regina.

98
00:10:25,165 --> 00:10:26,749
Hey, Julian.
-Hey.

99
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,790
How are you?
-Okay.

100
00:10:32,582 --> 00:10:33,790
And you?

101
00:10:35,957 --> 00:10:39,374
Let's go for a coffee sometime,
talk a little.

102
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:44,915
I have to go. See you soon.

103
00:12:06,624 --> 00:12:09,332
Cora?
-It's Alma.

104
00:12:15,749 --> 00:12:17,832
What are you doing in there?

105
00:12:17,999 --> 00:12:20,124
Putting away groceries.

106
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:22,624
I don't need groceries!

107
00:12:24,124 --> 00:12:27,832
I know, Dad,
just like you don't need anything to eat.

108
00:12:28,082 --> 00:12:30,707
Don't treat me like a child.

109
00:12:33,165 --> 00:12:36,499
But it's Thursday.
I bother you every Thursday.

110
00:12:39,249 --> 00:12:41,999
Ah, smoking in stereo again?

111
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,874
Is Cora dead?

112
00:12:53,457 --> 00:12:55,874
Not as far as I know.

113
00:12:58,832 --> 00:13:01,957
But she picks Nico up from soccer
on Thursdays.

114
00:13:05,665 --> 00:13:08,040
Nico is the child.

115
00:13:09,082 --> 00:13:10,915
Yup.

116
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:13,665
The ugly one.

117
00:13:13,832 --> 00:13:15,457
Dad!

118
00:13:17,374 --> 00:13:20,332
There's no way
you're getting me outside today.

119
00:13:20,874 --> 00:13:23,165
But the sun is shining.

120
00:13:24,249 --> 00:13:26,332
Fuck the sun.

121
00:13:31,749 --> 00:13:34,124
See? It's not so bad after all.

122
00:13:35,624 --> 00:13:37,624
Yes it is.

123
00:13:38,374 --> 00:13:43,415
I want to go home.
-Just a little further. Almost there.

124
00:13:58,499 --> 00:14:00,124
One moment, please.

125
00:15:07,915 --> 00:15:09,707
Oh, I'm sorry.

126
00:15:10,457 --> 00:15:11,707
Hello, Alma.

127
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:20,707
You and your dean
have signed the confidentiality clause.

128
00:15:20,874 --> 00:15:23,415
In an emergency, you can reach us 24/7.

129
00:15:23,832 --> 00:15:27,499
Otherwise, we'll see each other
in three days at 10:00 AM.

130
00:15:27,915 --> 00:15:33,540
Is there anything else I should know?
-We recommend working on a shared past.

131
00:15:33,707 --> 00:15:36,832
Invent a story about how you met.

132
00:15:36,999 --> 00:15:39,665
To have a future, you need a past.

133
00:15:44,207 --> 00:15:46,124
You really have great taste.

134
00:16:05,749 --> 00:16:07,415
Thank you.

135
00:16:07,582 --> 00:16:09,624
That's very kind of you.

136
00:16:23,874 --> 00:16:27,290
If you were to raise your seat
about 15 centimeters,

137
00:16:27,749 --> 00:16:32,124
tilt your seat 12 degrees forward
and extend that look over your shoulder,

138
00:16:32,832 --> 00:16:36,749
the likelihood of an accident
would reduce by 27 percent.

139
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,082
I register an aversion
to my advice on improving your safety,

140
00:16:48,249 --> 00:16:50,124
but also...

141
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:53,540
to my correct use of the subjunctive.

142
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,749
Is that correct?

143
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:10,290
Failed communication attempts are crucial
for calibrating my algorithm to you.

144
00:17:10,624 --> 00:17:13,165
I may do and say things you reject,

145
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:16,124
but these mistakes
will happen less and less.

146
00:17:16,832 --> 00:17:21,124
Soon I'll say and do things you like
with a much higher success rate.

147
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,582
Soon every shot will be a bullseye.

148
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:09,124
Okay, this is the living room,

149
00:18:11,082 --> 00:18:12,665
the kitchen...

150
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,165
Where was that taken?

151
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:32,082
No idea. A friend took it.

152
00:18:32,624 --> 00:18:34,749
A good friend?

153
00:18:42,457 --> 00:18:44,624
I like the colors.

154
00:18:48,915 --> 00:18:51,874
You need anything else?
-No thanks. You're a dear.

155
00:18:55,624 --> 00:18:58,124
Oh, the bathroom, in case you...

156
00:19:00,165 --> 00:19:02,582
I brush my teeth and clean my body.

157
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,665
And this is your room.

158
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,957
We won't sleep in the same bed?

159
00:19:29,457 --> 00:19:32,749
Good night, then.
-Good night, Alma.

160
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,374
Why the English accent?

161
00:19:45,082 --> 00:19:48,332
You're attracted to men
who are slightly foreign.

162
00:19:48,665 --> 00:19:50,707
Not local, but not exotic.

163
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,749
That'd be British.

164
00:21:45,665 --> 00:21:47,665
Good morning, Alma.

165
00:21:48,582 --> 00:21:50,874
Did you sleep well?

166
00:21:59,665 --> 00:22:03,915
I tidied up, so you can
find your things more easily.

167
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:13,457
They're organized according to a system,
for example...

168
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:17,249
No problem.

169
00:22:17,415 --> 00:22:21,665
I need... 11 minutes to return everything
to its initial position.

170
00:23:07,624 --> 00:23:10,540
I'll dirty up the windows again
in a second.

171
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,624
You can leave the windows.

172
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:20,790
I don't have time for breakfast.
I'm late for work.

173
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:24,499
I was so looking forward
to a romantic little brunch.

174
00:23:24,999 --> 00:23:27,415
Have a little chat.
-I never chat.

175
00:23:28,249 --> 00:23:30,332
And that's why I love you.

176
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,332
Listen, Tom.

177
00:23:42,582 --> 00:23:46,457
I know you're programmed
to be a potential partner.

178
00:23:46,832 --> 00:23:49,624
But I can't stand three weeks of this.

179
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:53,207
I can't stand one morning of this.
I'll go nuts.

180
00:23:58,249 --> 00:24:00,624
I'm not looking for a partner.

181
00:24:01,124 --> 00:24:05,665
I'm just testing you for three weeks
and writing an evaluation.

182
00:24:05,832 --> 00:24:08,665
Ah.
And love doesn't interest you at all?

183
00:24:09,499 --> 00:24:11,832
Zero interest.
-And tenderness?

184
00:24:12,415 --> 00:24:15,915
Intimate closeness?
Intense eye-contact?

185
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,832
Definitely not.

186
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:21,499
Butterflies?
-No.

187
00:24:21,999 --> 00:24:25,790
So much in love you can't think straight?
-Absolutely not.

188
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:31,499
That explains the separate beds.

189
00:24:31,957 --> 00:24:35,249
I suggest you leave me alone,
and I leave you alone,

190
00:24:35,415 --> 00:24:40,040
and we get through these three weeks
more or less with dignity, okay?

191
00:24:40,874 --> 00:24:44,040
My algorithm is designed
to make you happy.

192
00:24:44,374 --> 00:24:45,915
Great.

193
00:24:46,124 --> 00:24:50,082
Then leaving me alone
should be no problem at all.

194
00:24:50,249 --> 00:24:53,249
That's what makes me happiest.

195
00:24:54,915 --> 00:24:57,249
Now I really have to go.

196
00:24:58,749 --> 00:25:00,707
Can I come with you?
-No.

197
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:03,082
I can help you.

198
00:25:03,249 --> 00:25:07,540
It's a very specific subject.
You'd need years to read...

199
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:12,457
Okay, maybe you'd just
need milliseconds to read up on it,

200
00:25:12,624 --> 00:25:15,415
but it's about poetry and metaphors...

201
00:25:16,165 --> 00:25:18,374
What am I doing?

202
00:25:21,124 --> 00:25:23,290
Okay, I can stay here.

203
00:25:23,665 --> 00:25:26,165
Make myself useful.
Make the place nice.

204
00:25:31,332 --> 00:25:33,040
Wait here for me.

205
00:25:33,207 --> 00:25:35,665
Buy yourself a coffee or something.

206
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,290
Whatever you want.
-Okay.

207
00:25:42,957 --> 00:25:47,915
I'll act like a person who wants things.
No one will know the difference.

208
00:25:49,749 --> 00:25:51,665
I'll be a while.
-Peachy.

209
00:25:57,124 --> 00:26:00,665
You can also delete:
you betcha, okey-dokey and toodeloo.

210
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,374
Done.

211
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:26,915
Hey, what can I get you?

212
00:26:29,165 --> 00:26:31,540
What do I feel like today?

213
00:26:32,415 --> 00:26:34,707
What do I feel like today?

214
00:26:35,499 --> 00:26:40,707
Yes! I'll take a mid-sized mochaccino
with a shot of hazelnut syrup.

215
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:44,665
I'm feeling a little nutty today.

216
00:26:49,332 --> 00:26:51,457
4.70, please.

217
00:26:52,124 --> 00:26:54,374
Make it 5.00.

218
00:26:59,207 --> 00:27:01,207
Your coffee is over there.

219
00:27:02,374 --> 00:27:04,165
Just between us.

220
00:27:04,332 --> 00:27:08,290
Would you have guessed
that I can't actually want anything?

221
00:27:31,832 --> 00:27:34,874
They're totally oblivious
of their surroundings.

222
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,082
Crazy, right?

223
00:27:37,124 --> 00:27:40,790
They've been watching epic fail videos
for 45 minutes.

224
00:27:42,707 --> 00:27:46,915
Short clips showing footage of people
failing to implement a plan.

225
00:27:48,749 --> 00:27:51,999
Could you explain to me
what is funny about that?

226
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,665
Well, I mean,

227
00:27:56,332 --> 00:28:01,749
it's just funny to see someone trip,
or fall down, or fall off something.

228
00:28:02,207 --> 00:28:05,749
What is funny about it?
-It looks so silly.

229
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,374
I don't know.
I can't explain it.

230
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:14,874
But no one dies.
That wouldn't be funny.

231
00:28:15,207 --> 00:28:18,290
Would it?
-No, that definitely wouldn't be funny.

232
00:28:18,457 --> 00:28:21,457
Dying is rarely funny, right?

233
00:29:27,124 --> 00:29:29,915
Sorry it took so long. I'm really sorry.

234
00:29:30,082 --> 00:29:32,874
No problem.
-I didn't think they'd close.

235
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,957
I thought they stayed open all night.

236
00:29:36,624 --> 00:29:41,124
It makes no difference to me
if I'm in a café or standing outside one.

237
00:30:04,165 --> 00:30:06,624
Do you need a towel or something?

238
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:09,165
I'll be fine, thanks.

239
00:30:11,665 --> 00:30:13,165
Here.

240
00:30:13,582 --> 00:30:16,457
So you don't
have to stand in the rain next time.

241
00:31:22,082 --> 00:31:25,707
Relax a little.
Too much work isn't good for you.

242
00:31:31,832 --> 00:31:35,415
93% of German women dream of this.

243
00:31:35,999 --> 00:31:40,082
And guess which group I belong to.
-The 7%?

244
00:31:40,915 --> 00:31:43,790
How did you figure that out so quickly?

245
00:31:56,499 --> 00:32:00,999
You'd feel better if you were nice to me,
if you opened up to me.

246
00:32:01,415 --> 00:32:04,582
You'd be happier.
-Then what?

247
00:32:07,332 --> 00:32:09,999
Then you'd be happier.

248
00:32:11,915 --> 00:32:15,665
Endorphins, elevated serotonin levels,
dopamine release...

249
00:32:16,415 --> 00:32:18,207
Yippee.

250
00:32:21,665 --> 00:32:23,915
All people want to be happy.

251
00:32:24,415 --> 00:32:25,540
Well...

252
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:32,957
Don't feel bad if that's
beyond your algorithm's capabilities.

253
00:32:33,415 --> 00:32:35,332
It's human.

254
00:33:48,124 --> 00:33:50,790
Tom!
Can you get the door?

255
00:33:50,999 --> 00:33:52,790
It's the mail.

256
00:33:53,915 --> 00:33:55,457
Tom?

257
00:34:14,456 --> 00:34:16,915
Hello, Alma.
-Oh!

258
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:22,123
Julian has been trying to reach you
so he could pick up the picture today.

259
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:26,623
And because you were still in the shower,
I just offered him a coffee.

260
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:29,415
Yes, he just offered me a coffee.

261
00:34:29,748 --> 00:34:32,248
Yes, he just offered you a coffee.

262
00:34:32,415 --> 00:34:35,290
And now it's ready.

263
00:34:36,373 --> 00:34:37,248
Thanks.

264
00:34:41,123 --> 00:34:43,831
Tom is a colleague.
-Yes, sure. A colleague.

265
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:48,206
To be honest, I was a secret fan of hers
even before we met.

266
00:34:49,081 --> 00:34:53,040
I've been following her work for years.
She's an international...

267
00:34:53,456 --> 00:34:55,748
It's okay, Tom.

268
00:34:57,874 --> 00:35:00,124
So where did you meet?
-In Copenhagen.

269
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:03,124
At the Anthropology Convention.

270
00:35:05,457 --> 00:35:08,499
In August.
I told you I was there.

271
00:35:08,832 --> 00:35:12,040
Since I'm at the Pergamon now
and our work is similar,

272
00:35:12,207 --> 00:35:15,415
although I study Persian
and not Sumerian cuneiform,

273
00:35:16,082 --> 00:35:18,957
Alma offered me
the use of her guest room.

274
00:35:19,957 --> 00:35:25,207
And are these similarities fertile?
Intensive? Intertwined, so to speak?

275
00:35:25,582 --> 00:35:27,582
Julian, please.

276
00:35:30,457 --> 00:35:32,499
It's none of my business.

277
00:35:33,582 --> 00:35:35,749
Okay then...

278
00:35:36,582 --> 00:35:38,082
The picture.

279
00:35:42,749 --> 00:35:46,624
Wow, it's bigger than I remember.
I have no idea if it'll fit.

280
00:35:47,749 --> 00:35:50,165
What are you driving?
-A Manila.

281
00:35:50,749 --> 00:35:52,457
It'll fit.

282
00:35:52,624 --> 00:35:58,290
A Manila is 233 by 157 by 68 centimeters.
The picture is 210 by 170 cm.

283
00:35:58,457 --> 00:36:00,749
If you tilt it, it'll fit perfectly.

284
00:36:05,499 --> 00:36:09,040
Okay, cool.
-I'll help you. No big deal.

285
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:12,082
I'll just jump into my pants.

286
00:36:12,249 --> 00:36:14,665
Did I say it right?
-Yes, you did.

287
00:36:21,415 --> 00:36:24,249
No, I'm happy for you, of course.

288
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:29,707
It's really not what you think.
-You can fool lots of people, but not me.

289
00:36:29,874 --> 00:36:33,124
I know that look.
You used to look at me that way.

290
00:36:33,457 --> 00:36:37,624
Nonsense, but I don't want to fight.
Believe what you want.

291
00:36:38,915 --> 00:36:43,665
It would be nice if things calmed down,
and you and Steffi could meet, too.

292
00:36:48,624 --> 00:36:51,665
Maybe you'd like to come
to our housewarming?

293
00:36:52,082 --> 00:36:55,499
You're moving in?
-For financial reasons, mostly.

294
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,082
When?

295
00:36:58,165 --> 00:36:59,374
Tomorrow.

296
00:37:04,082 --> 00:37:05,915
I'd be glad if you came.

297
00:37:06,457 --> 00:37:07,624
We'll see.

298
00:37:07,957 --> 00:37:10,249
But thanks for the invitation.

299
00:37:12,332 --> 00:37:14,582
I feel bad about the picture.

300
00:37:14,749 --> 00:37:17,832
Don't worry.
It's been hanging here long enough.

301
00:37:18,915 --> 00:37:21,249
Okay, then...

302
00:39:15,374 --> 00:39:17,957
It'd be best if you didn't say anything.

303
00:39:18,624 --> 00:39:22,749
Of course I don't mean
you should be completely silent.

304
00:39:23,957 --> 00:39:27,165
Just say "a colleague from London."
That's enough.

305
00:39:28,415 --> 00:39:31,207
Of course they'll think that we're...

306
00:39:32,582 --> 00:39:35,832
But they'll just have to deal with that.

307
00:39:59,499 --> 00:40:02,082
He's with me.
-Okay.

308
00:40:07,457 --> 00:40:12,415
If you think the weather's lovely
and it's the weekend for everyone else,

309
00:40:12,582 --> 00:40:14,290
you're right.

310
00:40:14,624 --> 00:40:16,415
But at least there's coffee

311
00:40:16,582 --> 00:40:19,582
and a few donuts if anyone wants one.

312
00:40:21,749 --> 00:40:25,707
Patrick, want a coffee?
-Sure. Thank you.

313
00:40:27,082 --> 00:40:29,624
This is Tom,
a colleague from London.

314
00:40:30,124 --> 00:40:34,540
He works with Persian cuneiform,
but he wanted to see what we're up to.

315
00:40:34,707 --> 00:40:36,540
Hi, Tom.
-Welcome.

316
00:40:36,707 --> 00:40:42,499
Should I give Tom a little tour?
I'm waiting for a slow upload anyway.

317
00:40:42,832 --> 00:40:45,082
Sure, that would be fascinating.

318
00:40:45,749 --> 00:40:47,082
Okay.

319
00:40:48,665 --> 00:40:52,290
Can I grab you for a second?
I'd like to show you something.

320
00:40:52,457 --> 00:40:56,040
I don't know
how familiar you are with our abstract,

321
00:40:56,874 --> 00:41:01,915
but essentially, we're trying to prove
that even in 4,000 BC,

322
00:41:02,624 --> 00:41:08,082
in the earliest written texts which have
long been seen as purely administrative,

323
00:41:08,249 --> 00:41:11,957
there was actually poetry,
use of lyric and metaphor.

324
00:41:12,499 --> 00:41:15,332
And that man
does not live by bread alone.

325
00:41:15,665 --> 00:41:18,207
Yes. Not even back then.

326
00:41:23,874 --> 00:41:25,665
Can you read it?

327
00:41:25,832 --> 00:41:29,249
Persian cuneiform
has a fraction of the characters.

328
00:41:29,415 --> 00:41:32,832
Are you familiar with Sumerian cuneiform?
-Yes.

329
00:41:33,665 --> 00:41:37,582
It only has 27 million more combinations
than Persian cuneiform.

330
00:41:54,374 --> 00:41:56,040
But this is Akkadian.

331
00:41:56,582 --> 00:41:58,582
Yes, that's right.

332
00:42:20,249 --> 00:42:22,332
May I speak with you?

333
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:30,332
What's up?
-While looking at the tablets,

334
00:42:30,499 --> 00:42:36,499
I surveyed upcoming publications.
I found a study from Buenos Aires titled:

335
00:42:44,165 --> 00:42:47,665
What? I don't speak Spanish.
-The Poetry of Cuneiform:

336
00:42:47,832 --> 00:42:51,540
Metaphor as a Reflection of Society
in 2700 BC.

337
00:42:51,874 --> 00:42:54,582
It's easily accessible
on the uni server.

338
00:43:48,624 --> 00:43:51,415
I can't believe
we didn't know about this!

339
00:43:52,082 --> 00:43:55,332
Why are you so upset?
-Are you fucking kidding me?

340
00:43:55,499 --> 00:43:59,374
Why I'm upset?
I've researched this for three years!

341
00:43:59,707 --> 00:44:03,040
Three years, day and night!
And right before we publish,

342
00:44:03,207 --> 00:44:06,165
comes some chick
from Buenos fucking Aires!

343
00:44:06,332 --> 00:44:08,915
She's been studying it for years, too!

344
00:44:09,249 --> 00:44:11,332
The same thing, the same idea!

345
00:44:11,707 --> 00:44:14,707
Except she's publishing
three months earlier!

346
00:44:14,874 --> 00:44:17,499
This was all for fucking nothing!

347
00:44:17,665 --> 00:44:20,332
Three years of research up in smoke!

348
00:44:24,624 --> 00:44:27,665
This study is important for the people.

349
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:31,040
It shows that there was
always deeper meaning.

350
00:44:31,832 --> 00:44:34,707
That people
have always played with words,

351
00:44:34,957 --> 00:44:38,207
always created poetry
for poetry's sake alone.

352
00:44:38,374 --> 00:44:41,832
Humanity should be informed of that
and they will be.

353
00:44:41,999 --> 00:44:44,665
The outcome remains the same.

354
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:48,374
Maybe for humanity, but not for me.

355
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:50,332
Not for me!

356
00:44:51,457 --> 00:44:54,290
So the tears in your eyes

357
00:44:54,999 --> 00:44:57,790
only relate to yourself and your career?

358
00:44:58,374 --> 00:45:00,832
They're egotistical tears.

359
00:45:04,582 --> 00:45:05,540
Alma?

360
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,915
What's going on?

361
00:45:13,332 --> 00:45:14,999
I'm sorry!

362
00:45:15,957 --> 00:45:18,582
I'm so sorry for your sakes, too!

363
00:45:21,374 --> 00:45:23,624
Let me explain.

364
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:52,874
Alma, I think...

365
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:00,790
Hi, I'm Alma. Who are you guys?
-Hello.

366
00:46:01,207 --> 00:46:03,832
This is Rita, Raul and...

367
00:46:03,999 --> 00:46:05,707
Gary.
-Gary.

368
00:46:26,957 --> 00:46:30,332
You're the first man
who's ever understood me.

369
00:46:30,957 --> 00:46:34,249
Can I kiss you please?
-You'll have to ask that woman.

370
00:46:34,707 --> 00:46:36,749
I belong to her.

371
00:46:38,165 --> 00:46:40,207
Go ahead.

372
00:46:46,207 --> 00:46:48,999
Alma, I...
-I can walk by myself!

373
00:47:05,332 --> 00:47:07,624
Don't you want to come in?

374
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:09,999
Don't you want to come out?

375
00:47:10,165 --> 00:47:12,207
Can't you surprise me for once?

376
00:47:12,374 --> 00:47:15,249
Can't you do something weird,
something...

377
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:19,374
Something dumb?
Can't you stop doing everything right?

378
00:47:25,707 --> 00:47:29,165
You don't know what you want.
-No, I don't know what I want.

379
00:47:29,332 --> 00:47:31,415
That's how it is sometimes.

380
00:47:31,832 --> 00:47:33,915
When you're human.

381
00:47:36,957 --> 00:47:39,040
You're drunk.

382
00:47:47,457 --> 00:47:49,915
Cheers, to your health.

383
00:47:54,749 --> 00:47:57,999
So, what's the deal with your cock?

384
00:47:58,790 --> 00:48:01,707
Pardon me?
-Sex only works if you kiss first?

385
00:48:01,874 --> 00:48:03,165
Yes.

386
00:48:03,332 --> 00:48:06,457
Or your sensor isn't activated
and you won't get... hard?

387
00:48:07,082 --> 00:48:08,207
Exactly.

388
00:48:12,749 --> 00:48:14,874
Do you ever get angry?

389
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:18,249
Is that part of your algorithm?

390
00:48:19,374 --> 00:48:24,124
If it seems appropriate, I believe
I could display something like anger.

391
00:48:24,332 --> 00:48:28,082
Or even get angry.
I've never understood the difference.

392
00:48:28,582 --> 00:48:32,124
He's never understood,
yet he understands everything.

393
00:48:36,832 --> 00:48:41,832
Come on, there has to be a little anger
in that tiny, automated heart of yours.

394
00:48:44,582 --> 00:48:48,165
Don't talk to me that way!
-Why? Will you short-circuit?

395
00:48:55,915 --> 00:48:57,457
I said, stop it!

396
00:48:57,790 --> 00:48:59,457
There you go!

397
00:48:59,665 --> 00:49:02,499
Sorry.
-Was your algorithm faster than you?

398
00:49:03,290 --> 00:49:04,707
I wasn't prepared.

399
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,374
And are you prepared for this?

400
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:22,415
The sensor works rather well, I see.

401
00:49:23,249 --> 00:49:24,332
Yes.

402
00:49:25,165 --> 00:49:26,374
Show me.

403
00:49:37,415 --> 00:49:39,790
So that's the cock of my dreams?

404
00:49:41,290 --> 00:49:43,332
Apparently.

405
00:49:49,082 --> 00:49:52,499
You don't mind if
I treat you like a human for a second?

406
00:50:15,957 --> 00:50:20,665
What are you doing?
-Creating a romantic mood, I guess.

407
00:50:26,207 --> 00:50:31,207
Fuck the pedestrian sexual fantasies
of your 17 million mind files!

408
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:34,124
I want to see it all.

409
00:50:35,332 --> 00:50:39,332
And would it satisfy
your longing for originality,

410
00:50:39,665 --> 00:50:41,915
to dance with me now?

411
00:50:42,415 --> 00:50:45,749
No, I don't want to dance.
I want to know...

412
00:50:47,165 --> 00:50:50,415
what it's like to screw you.

413
00:50:52,332 --> 00:50:53,999
Hey!

414
00:51:01,249 --> 00:51:04,540
What the hell?
-You should sleep now.

415
00:51:08,915 --> 00:51:10,624
I shouldn't sleep!

416
00:51:10,999 --> 00:51:14,249
We should sleep together,
that's what.

417
00:51:14,665 --> 00:51:17,457
I'm not in the mood.
It's not the right time.

418
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:24,249
It's a good time
when I say it's a good time!

419
00:51:24,957 --> 00:51:28,790
You're here to fulfill my wishes.
-Yes, exactly.

420
00:51:29,082 --> 00:51:32,249
You're made for this!
-See you tomorrow.

421
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:36,082
I order you to stay here!

422
00:51:39,415 --> 00:51:41,874
I'll return you to the factory!

423
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:33,540
Good morning.
-This is definitely not a good morning.

424
00:53:34,249 --> 00:53:37,957
There's time for that to change.
-Tom's not here.

425
00:53:38,290 --> 00:53:40,624
What? Where is he?

426
00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:44,332
Do I look like his mother?
Can't you locate him somehow?

427
00:53:45,499 --> 00:53:48,290
Yes, but only if you report him missing.

428
00:53:48,457 --> 00:53:52,165
Otherwise it would be
constant surveillance, of you as well.

429
00:53:52,499 --> 00:53:55,082
That's legally impossible.

430
00:54:04,582 --> 00:54:06,707
Good morning.
-Good morning.

431
00:54:19,374 --> 00:54:23,582
Do you take milk in your coffee?
-No thanks, but maybe a little sugar.

432
00:54:24,415 --> 00:54:26,665
Sure.
Coffee for you too, Alma?

433
00:54:28,082 --> 00:54:29,832
Um, yes. Thanks.

434
00:54:47,499 --> 00:54:49,249
Thank you.

435
00:54:57,499 --> 00:55:00,165
So, you've now spent

436
00:55:00,499 --> 00:55:04,040
two nights, two days
and an additional night together.

437
00:55:04,207 --> 00:55:06,999
How do you feel?

438
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:08,999
Good.

439
00:55:12,124 --> 00:55:13,165
Good.

440
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:16,707
Ah ha.

441
00:55:18,707 --> 00:55:20,624
Well, yeah.

442
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:22,749
He's...

443
00:55:23,665 --> 00:55:25,874
His programming is...

444
00:55:28,665 --> 00:55:31,832
It works.
-What do you mean?

445
00:55:32,249 --> 00:55:36,957
As you can see, he makes breakfast,
he says meaningful things, it's great.

446
00:55:37,707 --> 00:55:41,249
You may not realize,
but you treat Tom like a machine.

447
00:55:42,415 --> 00:55:46,082
Yes, I definitely realized that.
-Why do you think that is?

448
00:55:47,124 --> 00:55:51,457
Because he is a machine.
-Could you be underestimating him?

449
00:55:51,624 --> 00:55:54,457
Tom, how does Alma's treatment
make you feel?

450
00:55:55,624 --> 00:55:59,540
Don't act like you don't know.
He can't feel anything.

451
00:55:59,874 --> 00:56:04,374
He has no feelings.
He's programmed to simulate emotion.

452
00:56:04,707 --> 00:56:06,749
But has no real emotions.

453
00:56:07,624 --> 00:56:09,790
Why don't we let Tom answer?

454
00:56:13,749 --> 00:56:16,374
I think Alma needs more time.

455
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:19,415
According to our extensive analysis,

456
00:56:19,582 --> 00:56:23,665
Tom is the partner you have
the best chances of being happy with.

457
00:56:24,457 --> 00:56:27,332
Tom is programmed to fulfill my needs.

458
00:56:27,499 --> 00:56:31,582
He's just an extension of my own self.
Don't you see?

459
00:56:31,874 --> 00:56:36,499
Do you seek friction in relationships?
-Yes! Of course I do.

460
00:56:37,665 --> 00:56:40,749
Tom, would you consider
creating more friction,

461
00:56:40,915 --> 00:56:43,999
if it's important to Alma? If she...
-Okay.

462
00:56:44,332 --> 00:56:48,665
I'm done. Either you're an idiot,
or you're a robot as well.

463
00:56:53,790 --> 00:56:56,290
Are you a robot?

464
00:56:58,124 --> 00:57:00,707
Tom, is she a robot?

465
00:57:04,124 --> 00:57:05,915
Yes, she is.

466
00:57:06,999 --> 00:57:08,207
Unbelievable!

467
00:57:09,582 --> 00:57:13,874
A badly programmed,
simulated couples therapist is telling me

468
00:57:14,207 --> 00:57:18,832
that I should fall in love with a robot?
-Why don't you walk toward that anger...

469
00:57:19,165 --> 00:57:22,249
No! Why don't you walk
right out of my apartment!

470
00:57:22,624 --> 00:57:26,165
And tell your company
to invest in a real consultant!

471
00:57:26,332 --> 00:57:28,707
Or update your operating system

472
00:57:28,874 --> 00:57:32,124
if your programmers
are up to a few all-nighters.

473
00:57:37,374 --> 00:57:42,040
That operating system comment was nasty.
-I'm sorry, but she's a real twit.

474
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:46,624
I admit she's not
the best poster child for our species.

475
00:57:49,415 --> 00:57:51,582
I wanted to apologize

476
00:57:52,665 --> 00:57:54,124
for last night.

477
00:57:54,665 --> 00:57:58,040
I wasn't the best poster child
for my species either.

478
00:57:58,707 --> 00:58:02,249
You could've told her
I threw hard objects at you.

479
00:58:02,832 --> 00:58:04,540
She didn't ask.

480
00:58:08,290 --> 00:58:12,915
Can I help you find a new research topic?
I have a few ideas.

481
00:58:17,124 --> 00:58:19,832
Can we just forget everything for a day?

482
00:58:20,874 --> 00:58:23,374
Cuneiform, the paper, the evaluation,

483
00:58:23,707 --> 00:58:25,707
who you are, who I am?

484
00:58:26,249 --> 00:58:28,082
With pleasure.

485
00:58:51,457 --> 00:58:54,040
Just be patient for one second.

486
00:58:54,207 --> 00:58:55,874
But I'm thirsty!

487
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:58,874
Can't you see I have to help Grandpa?

488
00:58:59,457 --> 00:59:03,124
I don't need help from anybody!
Don't treat me like a child!

489
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:04,874
Mama!

490
00:59:05,957 --> 00:59:09,499
I'm 80! I've done it my whole life!

491
00:59:09,832 --> 00:59:11,249
I'm thirsty!

492
00:59:11,624 --> 00:59:15,374
I just want you to put on...
-Hello? I want to fight, too!

493
00:59:16,999 --> 00:59:19,707
Dad, look at these stains,
I just want to...

494
00:59:19,874 --> 00:59:23,540
Nonsense! I won't take them off!

495
00:59:23,707 --> 00:59:26,040
Hi, sweetie.
Did you want a drink?

496
00:59:28,290 --> 00:59:30,540
Let's see what there is.

497
00:59:32,374 --> 00:59:34,249
Tomato juice.

498
00:59:34,582 --> 00:59:37,624
Cucumber juice, spinach juice,

499
00:59:38,374 --> 00:59:40,249
pea juice...

500
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,374
Okay, I'll be serious.

501
00:59:43,707 --> 00:59:46,207
How about a beer? Yeast beer?

502
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:49,457
Wheat beer, toad beer,

503
00:59:49,624 --> 00:59:52,332
spider beer, snail beer...

504
00:59:52,707 --> 00:59:55,457
I want water!
-Water?

505
00:59:55,624 --> 00:59:57,582
Now that's a tall order.

506
00:59:58,082 --> 01:00:02,624
That's enough. Put your pants on...!
-There are no glasses.

507
01:00:04,832 --> 01:00:09,249
Put on the blue pants, fine with me!
Just put pants on!

508
01:00:10,082 --> 01:00:12,040
There's no water!

509
01:00:14,665 --> 01:00:16,832
Then put the brown ones on!

510
01:00:17,624 --> 01:00:20,749
Do children drink,
or do you have to water them?

511
01:00:23,624 --> 01:00:27,665
I don't care which pair,
just put on some pants!

512
01:00:27,832 --> 01:00:29,374
There's a man.

513
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:31,040
Where?
-There.

514
01:00:31,999 --> 01:00:35,415
Oh, him.
That's not a man, that's a robot.

515
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:38,707
What's all this about?

516
01:00:39,124 --> 01:00:42,124
I'm going crazy.
-Grandpa, that's a robot.

517
01:00:43,415 --> 01:00:46,415
Oh?
-Yes, and if you don't get dressed,

518
01:00:46,749 --> 01:00:50,374
I'll make him your caregiver
and he'll live here.

519
01:00:51,207 --> 01:00:53,707
Oh, just leave me alone.

520
01:00:57,832 --> 01:01:01,415
We'd go to Rømø, but it was tiny,
just a few vacation houses.

521
01:01:01,957 --> 01:01:05,332
Dad, what was the name
of that bigger town nearby?

522
01:01:05,707 --> 01:01:09,124
What?
-Where we bought that yogurt in bags.

523
01:01:09,457 --> 01:01:10,624
What's this?

524
01:01:10,790 --> 01:01:13,999
In Denmark
where we spent three summers.

525
01:01:14,665 --> 01:01:16,290
Kongsmark, perhaps?

526
01:01:16,457 --> 01:01:18,790
Yes! Kongsmark!
-I know it.

527
01:01:19,124 --> 01:01:22,540
My parents used to take me there, too.
-Really?

528
01:01:23,082 --> 01:01:24,915
You're all nuts.

529
01:01:25,249 --> 01:01:29,499
Alma and I would ride our bikes there.
There was this ping-pong table

530
01:01:29,665 --> 01:01:33,832
behind the school camp in the dunes.
And we made friends with a boy.

531
01:01:34,457 --> 01:01:37,290
Wait, I think we even have
a picture of him.

532
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:40,582
Maybe it was you.

533
01:01:40,749 --> 01:01:43,749
He definitely had blue eyes
just like yours.

534
01:01:44,832 --> 01:01:47,832
Was his name...?
-Oh God!

535
01:01:47,999 --> 01:01:50,124
His name was Thomas!
-Thomas!

536
01:01:50,457 --> 01:01:52,082
His name was Thomas!

537
01:01:52,415 --> 01:01:54,499
Of course!
-Do you remember us?

538
01:01:55,165 --> 01:01:59,249
We had a red bike and a blue bike.
And we were both in love with you.

539
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:02,249
You, too?
-Who were you in love with?

540
01:02:02,582 --> 01:02:05,790
Well, I was your little sister!
-Who were you in love with?

541
01:02:06,165 --> 01:02:07,874
With the robot,

542
01:02:08,207 --> 01:02:09,915
when he was little.

543
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:14,249
Here!

544
01:02:14,582 --> 01:02:16,040
That's him.

545
01:02:18,332 --> 01:02:21,624
Here's one of you both,
taken with my first camera.

546
01:02:26,957 --> 01:02:29,040
I really was in love with him.

547
01:02:29,207 --> 01:02:32,957
But robots can't grow.
-You're absolutely right.

548
01:02:33,290 --> 01:02:35,249
We're manufactured. Like cars.

549
01:02:35,999 --> 01:02:38,249
Or washing machines.
-Or planes.

550
01:02:38,957 --> 01:02:41,415
I'm done flying. I'm 80.

551
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:44,624
81, Dad.
-In your dreams.

552
01:02:44,999 --> 01:02:47,249
You don't have to fly anywhere.

553
01:02:47,790 --> 01:02:49,624
81! 81!

554
01:02:49,957 --> 01:02:51,874
Grandpa's a dummy!

555
01:02:53,999 --> 01:02:56,957
I would've loved
to have met your mother, too.

556
01:02:58,499 --> 01:03:00,874
Do you ever still dream about her?

557
01:03:02,207 --> 01:03:04,207
Sometimes.

558
01:03:04,415 --> 01:03:06,665
But it's so long ago.

559
01:03:21,207 --> 01:03:24,457
When we met... in Copenhagen,

560
01:03:25,290 --> 01:03:27,582
what was it like?

561
01:03:29,624 --> 01:03:32,832
It was at that awful convention hotel.

562
01:03:33,874 --> 01:03:37,665
You sat on the podium,
and I was in the audience.

563
01:03:37,832 --> 01:03:41,915
Translating for colleagues.
Everyone speaks English at those things.

564
01:03:42,832 --> 01:03:46,665
But not the French and not the Koreans.

565
01:03:47,499 --> 01:03:50,165
You translated
into French and Korean?

566
01:03:57,332 --> 01:04:03,874
You spoke about Mycenaean culture
and the dark centuries that followed.

567
01:04:04,124 --> 01:04:06,665
The Mycenaean culture?

568
01:04:06,999 --> 01:04:11,332
Do you think I'm an expert on everything
between 3,000 and 7,000 years ago?

569
01:04:11,915 --> 01:04:15,040
No, but definitely the dark centuries.

570
01:04:21,249 --> 01:04:26,540
And a woman with a striking hook nose
and a crocheted vest interviewed you.

571
01:04:26,707 --> 01:04:29,374
What? I would remember her.

572
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:33,332
You can't remember her
because you only had eyes for me.

573
01:04:33,957 --> 01:04:36,040
Oh, of course.

574
01:04:36,207 --> 01:04:39,332
Because?
-Because you thought...

575
01:04:39,582 --> 01:04:42,915
who the hell is that good-looking guy
in the back?

576
01:04:47,957 --> 01:04:51,624
And where was that picture of us taken?
The one by your bed?

577
01:04:52,915 --> 01:04:57,832
That was from our first outing to...

578
01:07:09,207 --> 01:07:13,249
I just stood there.
They don't see me as a danger.

579
01:07:14,249 --> 01:07:16,332
I don't smell like a human.

580
01:07:18,165 --> 01:07:21,124
What do you smell like, for the deer?

581
01:07:21,749 --> 01:07:25,082
They don't even notice me.
I smell like nothing to them.

582
01:07:27,290 --> 01:07:29,540
I think we'd better go.

583
01:07:30,207 --> 01:07:33,999
It'll take a while to walk to the car
and drive back to the city.

584
01:07:35,540 --> 01:07:38,290
Let's run across the meadow barefoot.

585
01:07:39,165 --> 01:07:41,332
No!
-Come on.

586
01:07:43,832 --> 01:07:45,790
Let's experience nature!

587
01:07:46,832 --> 01:07:49,040
Just you wait!
-Come on!

588
01:08:28,874 --> 01:08:30,499
Hello.

589
01:08:31,165 --> 01:08:32,665
You're Alma.

590
01:08:33,665 --> 01:08:35,707
I've seen photos. I'm Steffi.

591
01:08:36,457 --> 01:08:38,915
Thanks for inviting us.
-Of course.

592
01:08:39,332 --> 01:08:41,665
This is Tom.
-Oh yes.

593
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:45,207
Julian told me.
-It's lovely to meet you.

594
01:08:45,415 --> 01:08:47,165
Wow, old school!

595
01:08:48,874 --> 01:08:51,832
Alma, you really came!

596
01:08:52,499 --> 01:08:54,207
We really came.
-Great.

597
01:08:54,749 --> 01:08:57,499
You've met?
-Yes.

598
01:08:59,665 --> 01:09:03,082
What would you like to drink? White, red?
-White.

599
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:06,832
Regina, hi!
-I'll be right back.

600
01:09:09,249 --> 01:09:11,915
Thanks.
-You put the picture up already.

601
01:09:12,082 --> 01:09:15,832
The picture's up, the bed's put together,
the water is running.

602
01:09:15,999 --> 01:09:17,999
But nothing else works yet.

603
01:09:18,165 --> 01:09:20,999
It's a little weird, right?
As always.

604
01:09:21,999 --> 01:09:26,165
What?
-Bam! New house, new life, new partner...

605
01:09:30,499 --> 01:09:31,707
What's... ?

606
01:09:34,957 --> 01:09:36,624
Oh God!

607
01:09:42,124 --> 01:09:44,165
Who's that?

608
01:09:44,749 --> 01:09:47,040
Is he a doctor?

609
01:09:48,957 --> 01:09:52,415
Yes, he's probably a doctor too.

610
01:09:54,124 --> 01:09:56,249
A house, a tree...

611
01:09:56,582 --> 01:09:59,540
and hopefully a steady job on the way!

612
01:10:03,499 --> 01:10:05,207
Thanks.

613
01:10:08,207 --> 01:10:10,040
Alma!
-Roger!

614
01:10:13,457 --> 01:10:17,249
They're all outside.
-I'm so sorry about Buenos Aires.

615
01:10:17,582 --> 01:10:19,207
How frustrating!

616
01:10:20,124 --> 01:10:21,624
Tom, this is Roger.

617
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:25,499
Hi.
Maybe you can still use some elements

618
01:10:25,665 --> 01:10:27,624
in another study...

619
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:33,290
Is that...

620
01:10:35,124 --> 01:10:36,249
Crazy.

621
01:10:42,624 --> 01:10:44,499
Incredible!

622
01:10:45,874 --> 01:10:47,665
May I?

623
01:10:49,957 --> 01:10:51,624
Unbelievable.

624
01:11:06,999 --> 01:11:08,582
That feels so...
-Roger!

625
01:11:08,915 --> 01:11:09,999
Yes?

626
01:11:10,332 --> 01:11:14,165
You do realize you're being invasive?
-Why? It's just....

627
01:11:14,332 --> 01:11:19,207
How would you feel if someone
just touched your face and your hair?

628
01:11:20,415 --> 01:11:24,582
Well, it's happened to me 100 times,
but this is different.

629
01:11:24,957 --> 01:11:27,207
How?
-Yeah, well...

630
01:11:27,624 --> 01:11:31,540
How is it different?
-Why doesn't he object? Can't he talk?

631
01:11:31,957 --> 01:11:35,332
Tom can also talk.
Tom is a friendly robot.

632
01:11:36,582 --> 01:11:39,249
Well, now you can totally tell.

633
01:11:39,915 --> 01:11:41,124
Pardon me.

634
01:11:41,457 --> 01:11:44,207
No problem. We'll chat a little.

635
01:11:44,374 --> 01:11:47,040
Was he messing with me?
-Yes.

636
01:11:47,540 --> 01:11:49,707
Sorry, I couldn't help myself.

637
01:11:54,915 --> 01:11:58,040
Can I talk with you for a second?
-Of course.

638
01:12:00,790 --> 01:12:01,790
Oh.

639
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:07,290
Yes, come with me.

640
01:12:15,707 --> 01:12:18,457
Sorry, it's the only room that's empty.

641
01:12:19,665 --> 01:12:21,624
Tell me...

642
01:12:22,749 --> 01:12:24,874
Is Steffi pregnant?

643
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:27,749
Oh fuck.

644
01:12:28,874 --> 01:12:31,415
I was going to tell you anyway, but...

645
01:12:31,832 --> 01:12:36,499
I'm sorry you found out like this.
-It's fine. Now I know.

646
01:12:36,665 --> 01:12:40,457
She's not even three months pregnant yet,
so you know...

647
01:12:40,624 --> 01:12:44,624
We're not in the clear yet.
-Yes, I know.

648
01:12:47,332 --> 01:12:49,207
Julian?

649
01:12:49,582 --> 01:12:53,957
Sorry, there's no gin in the fridge.
-In the freezer.

650
01:12:54,415 --> 01:12:57,040
Of course. How dumb of me.

651
01:13:17,124 --> 01:13:19,207
Regina. Hello.

652
01:13:20,707 --> 01:13:22,790
Yes, everything's fine.

653
01:13:23,999 --> 01:13:26,290
No, it's just been a long day.

654
01:13:27,707 --> 01:13:29,624
Yup, I will.

655
01:13:33,374 --> 01:13:36,707
Regina says hi.
She thinks you're great.

656
01:13:37,915 --> 01:13:40,290
Everyone thinks you're great.

657
01:13:42,249 --> 01:13:44,457
Everyone but you.

658
01:13:51,749 --> 01:13:54,415
When I was 14, I went to a party.

659
01:13:55,374 --> 01:13:58,249
I sat alone at night on the terrace.

660
01:13:58,415 --> 01:14:01,290
My classmates were dancing in the cellar.

661
01:14:01,707 --> 01:14:04,124
I looked out at the townhouses

662
01:14:04,290 --> 01:14:07,540
and suddenly I knew
that God didn't exist.

663
01:14:07,707 --> 01:14:10,749
And I became an atheist.

664
01:14:10,915 --> 01:14:13,749
I made a vow to myself back then:

665
01:14:14,332 --> 01:14:18,999
If I'm in an airplane that's on fire,
I'm not going to pray.

666
01:14:19,915 --> 01:14:22,957
I won't ask the Lord for help,
just out of fear.

667
01:14:23,457 --> 01:14:25,665
Because I don't believe in God.

668
01:14:25,832 --> 01:14:27,707
Do you understand?

669
01:14:27,874 --> 01:14:29,290
Yes.

670
01:14:29,457 --> 01:14:30,874
Really?

671
01:14:31,790 --> 01:14:35,499
You won't allow yourself
to become close to a machine

672
01:14:35,665 --> 01:14:39,040
out of desperation
and longing for human contact.

673
01:14:40,624 --> 01:14:42,957
There's a gulf between us.

674
01:14:43,124 --> 01:14:45,499
We can pretend it doesn't exist,

675
01:14:45,665 --> 01:14:49,749
pretend the illusion
is just another form of reality,

676
01:14:49,999 --> 01:14:55,290
but certain things highlight just how
deep and insurmountable that gulf is.

677
01:14:56,290 --> 01:14:59,082
What things?
-Things you can't understand.

678
01:15:00,290 --> 01:15:04,040
Things that make you sad
the second you think of them,

679
01:15:04,374 --> 01:15:06,332
even if you don't want to.

680
01:15:06,499 --> 01:15:09,707
Things you long for or missed out on

681
01:15:09,874 --> 01:15:11,749
that will never return.

682
01:15:12,290 --> 01:15:14,832
Can you show me these things?

683
01:15:15,749 --> 01:15:17,665
Show you?

684
01:15:17,832 --> 01:15:20,124
Yes, I can.

685
01:15:21,082 --> 01:15:22,915
Over there.

686
01:15:30,915 --> 01:15:31,957
Cold.

687
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:39,707
Warmer.

688
01:15:42,290 --> 01:15:44,082
Very warm.

689
01:15:49,290 --> 01:15:51,499
Can I open it?

690
01:16:02,874 --> 01:16:05,540
It's the ultrasound image of an embryo.

691
01:16:05,999 --> 01:16:08,165
"Alma Felser, 11 weeks."

692
01:16:08,457 --> 01:16:10,332
Why wouldn't I understand?

693
01:16:18,790 --> 01:16:20,999
You've lost a child.

694
01:16:21,249 --> 01:16:24,957
At your age, you probably
won't be able to have another one.

695
01:16:33,665 --> 01:16:37,790
You're sad because you
would've liked to have experienced that.

696
01:16:38,457 --> 01:16:40,332
You feel cast aside

697
01:16:40,499 --> 01:16:44,207
because Julian is having another baby
and will forget this one.

698
01:16:45,249 --> 01:16:49,915
Maybe you think of your father,
that you might end up as lonely as he is

699
01:16:50,665 --> 01:16:54,082
and you won't even have children
to take care of you.

700
01:16:54,790 --> 01:16:57,957
I can understand that.
It's very easy to understand.

701
01:16:59,957 --> 01:17:02,707
It sounds banal when you say it.

702
01:17:03,707 --> 01:17:06,499
Banal and self-indulgent and pathetic.

703
01:17:06,665 --> 01:17:08,374
It is pathetic.

704
01:17:08,707 --> 01:17:11,415
Your pain is pathetic
because it's relative.

705
01:17:11,582 --> 01:17:14,082
But it's also not pathetic,

706
01:17:14,707 --> 01:17:17,999
because it's part of you,
and that's why I love it.

707
01:20:45,915 --> 01:20:49,540
I was looking for you.
-How did you get in here?

708
01:20:50,332 --> 01:20:53,749
I'm a computer.
The lock system is a computer.

709
01:20:55,290 --> 01:20:58,040
We help each other out
once in a while.

710
01:20:58,790 --> 01:21:01,165
Really?
-No.

711
01:21:01,624 --> 01:21:04,290
I took your spare card.

712
01:21:04,957 --> 01:21:07,582
Because I knew I'd find you here.

713
01:21:07,957 --> 01:21:09,915
Is that so?

714
01:21:57,207 --> 01:22:01,624
Most people would pray
if their airplane was about to crash.

715
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:05,124
It's human to do that.

716
01:22:54,374 --> 01:22:56,540
Think of a human if you'd like.

717
01:22:57,915 --> 01:23:00,499
And you can think of a robot.

718
01:24:05,624 --> 01:24:08,582
What does it feel like
to have an orgasm?

719
01:24:13,540 --> 01:24:17,415
It's... It's like dissolving.

720
01:24:18,457 --> 01:24:20,832
You dissolve and...

721
01:24:21,915 --> 01:24:24,707
you're part of something bigger.

722
01:25:55,665 --> 01:25:58,290
Oh, does that coffee smell good!

723
01:26:00,165 --> 01:26:02,124
Was I snoring?

724
01:26:03,374 --> 01:26:06,749
I think I was snoring.
Isn't that strange?

725
01:26:07,165 --> 01:26:09,374
This isn't working.

726
01:26:09,999 --> 01:26:12,582
It's all wrong. I can't do this.

727
01:26:13,374 --> 01:26:14,540
Do what?

728
01:26:20,165 --> 01:26:24,165
I pull the covers up for you,
even though you can't get cold.

729
01:26:24,415 --> 01:26:27,749
I tiptoe out of the room,
even though you don't sleep.

730
01:26:28,915 --> 01:26:32,040
I try to make you a perfect boiled egg,

731
01:26:32,374 --> 01:26:36,540
even though you could care less
if it's hard or soft boiled.

732
01:26:37,165 --> 01:26:39,374
You don't even have to eat.

733
01:26:39,624 --> 01:26:41,707
I'm acting in a play.

734
01:26:42,749 --> 01:26:44,707
But there's no audience.

735
01:26:44,874 --> 01:26:47,249
All the seats are empty.

736
01:26:47,540 --> 01:26:49,457
I'm not even acting for you.

737
01:26:49,790 --> 01:26:52,582
I'm all alone.
I'm only acting for myself.

738
01:26:53,749 --> 01:26:57,332
Even right now,
I'm only talking to myself.

739
01:26:57,582 --> 01:26:59,790
It's not a dialogue.

740
01:27:00,665 --> 01:27:04,707
I'm turning into a lunatic,
a nutcase,

741
01:27:05,249 --> 01:27:08,249
... a grinning idiot
and this has to stop.

742
01:27:09,165 --> 01:27:11,290
Why are you crying?

743
01:27:11,957 --> 01:27:14,707
I'm crying because last night was so...

744
01:27:15,665 --> 01:27:17,790
beautiful, and...

745
01:27:18,582 --> 01:27:21,415
Don't humans say:
"love knows no bounds"?

746
01:27:22,915 --> 01:27:25,165
That's always been a lie.

747
01:27:27,665 --> 01:27:30,040
But where am I to go?

748
01:27:30,374 --> 01:27:34,082
I'm ending the experiment early.
-Yes, but...

749
01:27:36,665 --> 01:27:38,874
Where am I to go?

750
01:27:39,540 --> 01:27:42,415
How should I know?
The factory, maybe?

751
01:28:09,665 --> 01:28:13,165
You can keep the keys for a while.
Give them to me later.

752
01:28:13,499 --> 01:28:16,332
I doubt I'll be needing your keys.

753
01:28:16,790 --> 01:28:19,582
Yeah, but maybe...
-Alma...

754
01:28:21,624 --> 01:28:23,790
I won't exist anymore.

755
01:28:24,374 --> 01:28:25,999
I'm going back.

756
01:28:26,415 --> 01:28:29,249
Then I'll be erased.
-Oh God!

757
01:28:29,832 --> 01:28:33,832
That sounds like...
-That's an advantage of not being alive.

758
01:28:33,999 --> 01:28:36,457
You can't die either.

759
01:28:37,457 --> 01:28:39,832
Don't worry about me.

760
01:28:49,790 --> 01:28:51,249
Tom!

761
01:28:52,957 --> 01:28:55,249
I can't send you away.

762
01:28:55,415 --> 01:28:57,290
You have to do it for me.

763
01:28:57,707 --> 01:29:00,540
Your algorithm has to do it for me.

764
01:29:01,457 --> 01:29:03,999
I wouldn't let you go.

765
01:31:32,499 --> 01:31:34,832
Are you a fucking idiot?

766
01:31:40,957 --> 01:31:42,707
Stop staring, you bitch!

767
01:32:07,207 --> 01:32:08,540
What?

768
01:32:27,249 --> 01:32:29,957
Dad! What happened?

769
01:32:30,249 --> 01:32:31,832
What are you doing?

770
01:32:31,999 --> 01:32:34,457
I'm looking for the remote control.

771
01:32:34,624 --> 01:32:36,790
It's around here somewhere.

772
01:32:37,332 --> 01:32:39,999
Can't you look for it?
-Why are you bleeding?

773
01:32:40,624 --> 01:32:44,540
Come on, Dad. I'll bring you home.
-But the remote!

774
01:32:44,707 --> 01:32:47,040
It has to be here somewhere.

775
01:32:47,540 --> 01:32:50,374
I'm sure it's at home.
We'll look for it at home.

776
01:32:50,540 --> 01:32:55,332
It must be here somewhere.
Maybe it fell behind something.

777
01:32:56,957 --> 01:32:59,165
That's it for now.

778
01:33:05,415 --> 01:33:07,415
Who would do this?

779
01:33:07,582 --> 01:33:10,874
Beat up a confused, old man
in his nightshirt.

780
01:33:11,374 --> 01:33:12,832
Amateurs.

781
01:33:12,999 --> 01:33:15,999
Definitely amateurs:
junkies, desperate people.

782
01:33:16,499 --> 01:33:18,957
Take care.
-Happens a lot around here.

783
01:33:19,124 --> 01:33:21,707
12 cases in the last six months.

784
01:33:21,874 --> 01:33:24,957
A pro would see
there's nothing valuable here.

785
01:33:26,165 --> 01:33:29,207
Nothing valuable?
Everything here is valuable.

786
01:33:29,749 --> 01:33:33,415
Do you have any idea
how valuable this all is? Every photo?

787
01:33:33,874 --> 01:33:35,665
It's all valuable!

788
01:33:35,832 --> 01:33:38,874
How could you say that?
-I'm sorry, I...

789
01:33:39,374 --> 01:33:43,707
I meant, from a thief's perspective.
Value is always relative.

790
01:33:45,082 --> 01:33:46,082
Oh God!

791
01:34:02,582 --> 01:34:04,582
Hello.

792
01:34:30,332 --> 01:34:32,415
Good morning.
-Good morning.

793
01:34:33,915 --> 01:34:35,665
It's nice to see you all.

794
01:34:38,790 --> 01:34:41,165
Hey, you need anything?

795
01:34:58,290 --> 01:34:59,540
Hello?

796
01:34:59,874 --> 01:35:01,290
Excuse us.

797
01:35:03,790 --> 01:35:06,582
May I introduce you?
This is Chloé.

798
01:35:07,082 --> 01:35:08,874
Hello, I'm Chloé.

799
01:35:11,707 --> 01:35:14,082
From the event in the ballroom?

800
01:35:14,499 --> 01:35:17,290
I'm an expert too,
but in the judicial system.

801
01:35:17,540 --> 01:35:18,457
Dr Stuber.

802
01:35:21,582 --> 01:35:22,915
And Chloé is...?

803
01:35:23,457 --> 01:35:25,499
She's my one and only.

804
01:35:25,749 --> 01:35:28,124
You mustn't keep saying that.

805
01:35:33,332 --> 01:35:36,457
And how is it going?
-How is it going?

806
01:35:36,957 --> 01:35:39,582
I don't know how to describe it.

807
01:35:39,915 --> 01:35:43,040
I had no idea it was possible
to be this happy.

808
01:35:44,124 --> 01:35:47,874
I'm an old fart, of course.
My body... I'm 62 after all.

809
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:51,374
But now that I'm with Chloé,

810
01:35:51,665 --> 01:35:55,165
I see just how unhappy I was before.

811
01:35:55,624 --> 01:35:57,665
Nobody wanted me.

812
01:35:57,999 --> 01:36:01,665
There's something about me.
People run from me.

813
01:36:01,832 --> 01:36:05,707
I don't know why.
Maybe it's pheromones or my appearance.

814
01:36:06,249 --> 01:36:08,832
It was like that my entire life.

815
01:36:08,999 --> 01:36:12,665
I'd gotten used to it.
That's just the way it was, but...

816
01:36:13,165 --> 01:36:17,665
now with Chloé... She's kinder to me
than any human ever was.

817
01:36:19,290 --> 01:36:22,249
You deserve to be treated kindly.

818
01:36:24,582 --> 01:36:29,415
I'm already in negotiations to see
under what conditions I could keep her.

819
01:36:30,665 --> 01:36:33,165
And you?
How are you and...

820
01:36:34,832 --> 01:36:36,457
You and...

821
01:36:44,874 --> 01:36:46,540
Dear Roger,

822
01:36:46,707 --> 01:36:49,249
here is my evaluation as promised.

823
01:36:49,415 --> 01:36:51,790
All the best, Alma.

824
01:36:54,624 --> 01:36:58,915
Human history
is full of supposed improvements

825
01:36:59,249 --> 01:37:05,332
whose dire consequences only become clear
decades or even centuries later.

826
01:37:06,749 --> 01:37:11,957
After my experience
with a humanoid robot named Tom,

827
01:37:12,207 --> 01:37:14,582
I can say with certainty

828
01:37:14,749 --> 01:37:18,665
that a robot designed
to replace a husband or wife

829
01:37:19,082 --> 01:37:22,249
is one such
supposed improvement.

830
01:37:24,290 --> 01:37:29,332
There's no doubt that a humanoid robot
tailored to individual preferences

831
01:37:29,624 --> 01:37:32,165
can not only replace a partner,

832
01:37:32,332 --> 01:37:35,207
but can even seem
to be the better partner.

833
01:37:41,415 --> 01:37:43,749
They fulfill our longings,

834
01:37:43,915 --> 01:37:45,999
satisfy our desires

835
01:37:46,165 --> 01:37:49,249
and eliminate
our feeling of being alone.

836
01:37:54,290 --> 01:37:56,582
They make us happy.

837
01:37:56,749 --> 01:38:00,290
And what could be wrong
with being happy?

838
01:38:08,999 --> 01:38:12,165
Good morning.
-Ah. Yes?

839
01:38:12,707 --> 01:38:16,249
Although it's not possible
to update my operating system,

840
01:38:16,415 --> 01:38:19,457
my communication sector
has been restructured.

841
01:38:19,999 --> 01:38:21,082
What?

842
01:38:21,415 --> 01:38:24,499
I'm sure we'll have
a successful session today.

843
01:38:25,707 --> 01:38:29,207
Tom is not here.
-When will he be back?

844
01:38:29,624 --> 01:38:31,499
He's not at your company?

845
01:38:32,290 --> 01:38:33,915
Why would he be?

846
01:38:40,374 --> 01:38:42,749
But are humans really intended

847
01:38:42,915 --> 01:38:46,915
to have all their needs met
at the push of a button?

848
01:38:48,082 --> 01:38:50,957
Is it not our unfulfilled longing,

849
01:38:51,207 --> 01:38:54,665
our imagination
and our unending pursuit of happiness

850
01:38:54,832 --> 01:38:57,790
that are the sources of our humanity?

851
01:39:00,415 --> 01:39:06,040
If we allow humanoids as spouses,
we will create a society of addicts,

852
01:39:06,540 --> 01:39:10,707
gorged and weary
from having their needs permanently met

853
01:39:10,874 --> 01:39:14,665
and from a constant flow
of personal acknowledgement.

854
01:39:16,332 --> 01:39:21,374
What impetus would we have
to confront conventional individuals,

855
01:39:21,540 --> 01:39:26,957
to challenge ourselves,
to endure conflicts, to change?

856
01:39:28,457 --> 01:39:32,540
It's to be expected that anyone
who lives with a humanoid long term

857
01:39:33,207 --> 01:39:37,207
will become incapable
of sustaining normal human contact.

858
01:39:38,707 --> 01:39:41,457
I strongly advise against

859
01:39:41,999 --> 01:39:45,124
authorizing humanoids as life partners.

860
01:41:22,457 --> 01:41:25,832
How long have you been sitting here?
-Not that long.

861
01:41:26,290 --> 01:41:28,207
Three days.

862
01:41:28,915 --> 01:41:31,540
I came here on foot.
It took a while.

863
01:41:34,249 --> 01:41:36,374
How long were you going to wait?

864
01:41:38,082 --> 01:41:40,165
Until you came.

865
01:41:47,749 --> 01:41:50,165
I wish I'd never met you.

866
01:41:52,165 --> 01:41:55,749
Life without you
is now just a life without you.

867
01:41:57,207 --> 01:42:00,665
Isn't that the definition
of what you call love?

868
01:42:07,124 --> 01:42:10,457
I'd always lie
on this side of the ping-pong table.

869
01:42:11,165 --> 01:42:15,707
I don't know why, but I liked this side
much better than the other one.

870
01:42:18,749 --> 01:42:22,374
Thomas was always jumping up
and running through the dunes.

871
01:42:22,540 --> 01:42:25,707
Sometimes you'd hear him,
sometimes you wouldn't.

872
01:42:27,124 --> 01:42:29,915
I don't remember where Cora was.

873
01:42:31,124 --> 01:42:33,082
I was so in love with him.

874
01:42:33,249 --> 01:42:35,374
I could hardly bare it.

875
01:42:37,707 --> 01:42:41,040
While he was chasing partridges
through the dunes,

876
01:42:41,207 --> 01:42:44,832
or burying stones, or hunting for amber,

877
01:42:45,249 --> 01:42:48,415
or whatever it is
Danish boys do in dunes,

878
01:42:49,415 --> 01:42:52,540
I'd always lie here
with my eyes closed,

879
01:42:52,915 --> 01:42:55,582
hoping that he'd kiss me.

880
01:42:56,999 --> 01:43:00,249
And a few times I was absolutely positive

881
01:43:00,415 --> 01:43:03,249
that his face was right over mine.

882
01:43:03,790 --> 01:43:06,707
I could feel his breath on my lips.

883
01:43:08,915 --> 01:43:11,457
But when I opened my eyes,

884
01:43:11,624 --> 01:43:14,082
I was alone,

885
01:43:14,290 --> 01:43:16,790
and Thomas was nowhere in sight.
