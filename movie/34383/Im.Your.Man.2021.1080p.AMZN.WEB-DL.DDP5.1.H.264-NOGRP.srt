1
00:00:45,832 --> 00:00:49,624
我 是 你 的 人
I'M YOUR MAN

2
00:00:51,082 --> 00:00:53,124
- 歡迎   - 你好
- Welcome.   - Hello.

3
00:01:00,499 --> 00:01:02,332
費爾瑟博士
Dr. Felser.

4
00:01:02,499 --> 00:01:04,540
請  跟我來
Please follow me.

5
00:01:29,457 --> 00:01:31,582
你好  艾瑪  我是湯姆
Hi, Alma. I'm Tom.

6
00:01:34,289 --> 00:01:36,624
很高興見到你  艾瑪
Nice to meet you, Alma.

7
00:01:37,332 --> 00:01:39,289
我們坐下談談吧
Shall we sit down?

8
00:01:44,414 --> 00:01:46,749
你要喝點什麼
What can I bring you to drink?

9
00:01:47,124 --> 00:01:49,289
波爾多葡萄酒很不錯哦
The Bordeaux is a real treat.

10
00:01:50,289 --> 00:01:52,332
要波爾多葡萄酒嗎
Bordeaux for the lady?

11
00:01:58,124 --> 00:02:00,665
你非常溧亮  艾瑪
You're a very beautiful woman, Alma.

12
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:06,749
你的眼睛就像兩個山中的湖泊  我可以沉入其中
Your eyes are like two mountain lakes I could sink into.

13
00:02:19,082 --> 00:02:20,499
湯姆  對吧
Tom, right?

14
00:02:20,832 --> 00:02:22,915
你不喜歡別人的讚美嗎
Don't you like compliments?

15
00:02:23,457 --> 00:02:25,457
你相信上帝嗎
Do you believe in God?

16
00:02:25,707 --> 00:02:28,957
這不是討論這種問題的地方
This is hardly the place to discuss such a question.

17
00:02:29,999 --> 00:02:33,582
(賴內.馬利亞.里爾克  奧地利著名詩人)
- 你有最喜歡的詩嗎   - 我特別喜歡里爾克
- Do you have a favorite poem?   - I particularly like Rilke.

18
00:02:33,874 --> 00:02:35,957
例如《秋日》
Autumn Day, for example.

19
00:02:36,124 --> 00:02:37,790
第六和第七行是什麼
Sixth and seventh lines?

20
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:43,249
催促它們向盡善盡美成長  並把最後的甜蜜釀進濃酒
"Press them to ripeness, and chase The last sweetness into the heavy wine."

21
00:02:43,582 --> 00:02:46,499
- 這首詩倒數第二個字母是什麼   - E
- Second to last letter of the poem?   - E.

22
00:02:49,207 --> 00:02:53,082
- 生命的意義是什麼   - 讓世界變得更美好
- What is the meaning of life?   - To make the world a better place.

23
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,290
3587乘以982除以731等於多少
3,587 times 982, divided by 731?

24
00:02:58,749 --> 00:03:01,665
4,818.65116.
4,818.65116.

25
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,790
你能想到的最悲傷的事情是什麼
What is the saddest thing you can think of.

26
00:03:12,749 --> 00:03:14,790
孤獨地死去
Dying alone.

27
00:03:19,957 --> 00:03:22,415
我們跳舞吧  倫巴舞
Shall we dance? Rumba!

28
00:03:29,207 --> 00:03:32,749
我建議你不要拒絕這個機會  費爾瑟博士
I suggest you take advantage of the opportunity, Dr. Felser.

29
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,207
你會大吃一驚的
You will be amazed.

30
00:04:25,415 --> 00:04:27,374
我做錯了什麼嗎
Am I doing something wrong?

31
00:04:30,665 --> 00:04:32,665
我...我...
I am... I am...

32
00:04:33,165 --> 00:04:34,540
我...我...
I am... I am...

33
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,665
請原諒這種複雜情況
Please excuse this complication.

34
00:05:10,999 --> 00:05:14,249
但是我向你保證  這種型號出現這樣的情況非常罕見
But I assure you, it's extremely rare with this model.

35
00:05:14,582 --> 00:05:17,457
就像中彩票一樣罕見
As rare as winning the lottery.

36
00:05:17,624 --> 00:05:19,790
我的意思是  就概率而言
I mean, in terms of probability.

37
00:05:20,165 --> 00:05:24,707
我向你保證  我們的技術人員明天晚上會把一切都處理妥當
I assure you, our technicians will have everything in order by tomorrow night.

38
00:05:25,082 --> 00:05:27,999
對於這次令人不快的耽擱  我們感到非常抱歉
We are so sorry for this unpleasant delay.

39
00:05:28,624 --> 00:05:30,499
沒關係
No problem.

40
00:05:42,915 --> 00:05:46,165
你不知道編寫調情程序有多難
You have no idea how hard it is to program flirting.

41
00:05:46,332 --> 00:05:50,124
只需一個錯誤的舉動  一個誤導的目光  一句不經意的話
One false move, one misleading glance, one careless remark,

42
00:05:50,457 --> 00:05:53,790
然後浪漫就煙消雲散了  我說的對嗎
and the romance evaporates. Am I right?

43
00:05:55,499 --> 00:05:59,082
這整個佈置可能看起來有點奢侈
This whole setting might seem a bit extravagant,

44
00:05:59,582 --> 00:06:04,874
但這種浪漫的邂逅為我們的最終調整提供了寶貴的信息
but this romantic encounter gives us valuable input for the final adjustments.

45
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:10,665
即使你是三個星期內測試湯姆的十位專家之一
And even though you're one of ten experts testing Tom for just three weeks,

46
00:06:10,832 --> 00:06:15,124
但你們第一次見面的氣氛是非常重要的
the atmosphere of your first encounter is of utmost importance.

47
00:06:17,582 --> 00:06:20,874
- 那可是很費力的事   - 沒有你想的那麼費力
- That's a lot of effort.   - Not as much as you think.

48
00:06:26,332 --> 00:06:27,707
全息成像
Holograms.

49
00:06:27,874 --> 00:06:30,874
它們更便宜  而且可以跳得更久
They're cheaper and they can dance longer.

50
00:06:41,915 --> 00:06:46,082
我知道你帶著某種超然的情緒來看待這件事
I know you see this with a certain emotional detachment,

51
00:06:46,249 --> 00:06:49,165
作為一個測試者  你應該這樣做
which you should as a test person,

52
00:06:49,332 --> 00:06:54,040
但我強烈建議你敞開心扉接受這種體驗
but I highly recommend that you open yourself up to this experience.

53
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:57,915
當幸福來敲門時  你不該將其拒之門外
When happiness knocks at your door, you should open it.

54
00:06:58,082 --> 00:06:59,915
明天可是個大日子
Tomorrow's the big day.

55
00:07:00,082 --> 00:07:03,457
一切都將配置好  然後你可以把湯姆帶回家了
Everything will be configured, and you can take Tom home.

56
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:04,832
好的  謝謝
Okay, thanks.

57
00:07:41,499 --> 00:07:43,707
- 你好  朱莉安   - 你好  艾瑪
- Hello, Juliane.   - Hello, Alma.

58
00:07:49,457 --> 00:07:52,415
抱歉  我有事耽擱了  你們不會想知道的
Sorry, I got held up. You don't want to know.

59
00:07:52,582 --> 00:07:56,790
我馬上要在出去一趟  2202掃瞄完成了嗎
I have to go again in a second, too. Is scan 2202 done?

60
00:07:56,957 --> 00:07:59,040
是的  在桌子上
Yes, it's on the desk.

61
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,999
剩下的時間不多了  這是最後的衝刺了
There's not much time left. It's the final sprint.

62
00:08:13,207 --> 00:08:14,915
- 明天見   - 明天見
- See you tomorrow.   - See you.

63
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:22,124
他們測試我  掃瞄我的大腦  給我不間斷的調查
They test me, scan my brain, give me non-stop surveys,

64
00:08:22,457 --> 00:08:24,582
然後他們輸入
then they feed those things

65
00:08:24,749 --> 00:08:27,999
來自一千七百萬人的所謂思維文件
with so-called mind files from 17 million people:

66
00:08:28,165 --> 00:08:30,457
特徵  觀點  感覺
traits, views, feelings...

67
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:34,164
超級複雜  天知道要花多少錢
It's super complex, and God knows how much it costs.

68
00:08:34,499 --> 00:08:36,664
結果是什麼
And what's the result?

69
00:08:37,332 --> 00:08:40,832
「你的眼睛就像兩個山中的湖泊  我可以沉入其中」
"Your eyes are like two mountain lakes I could sink into."

70
00:08:43,624 --> 00:08:46,915
也許他們比你更了解你自己
Maybe they know you better than you know yourself.

71
00:08:47,749 --> 00:08:50,332
我很想試試
I'd love to try it.

72
00:08:50,665 --> 00:08:54,040
- 你設計了你的理想伴侶嗎   - 是的
- Have your dream girl built for you?   - Yeah.

73
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:58,082
但是我已經把她帶回家了  不開玩笑了
But I've already got her at home. All joking aside.

74
00:08:59,582 --> 00:09:01,749
不管我們怎樣想
Regardless of our opinion,

75
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:05,415
我是倫理委員會的成員  我需要你的評估
I'm on the ethics committee and I need your evaluation.

76
00:09:05,915 --> 00:09:08,790
- 我已經知道夠多了  現在就可以寫報告   - 艾瑪  這是關於
- I've seen enough to write it.   - Alma, this is about

77
00:09:09,124 --> 00:09:12,624
這些東西是否會被允許結婚  工作
whether these things will be allowed to marry, to work,

78
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:17,124
拿到護照  人權  或者部分人權  或者...
to get passports, human rights, or partial human rights or...

79
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:19,874
羅傑  我...
Roger, I...

80
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,749
我不知道...
Oh, I didn't know that...

81
00:09:23,915 --> 00:09:26,124
抱歉  你好  艾瑪
Sorry. Hello, Alma.

82
00:09:27,915 --> 00:09:29,457
你好  朱利安
Hello, Julian.

83
00:09:29,665 --> 00:09:31,290
嗯  那...
Um, it...

84
00:09:31,499 --> 00:09:34,082
其實不急  我一會兒再來
It's not urgent. I'll come back.

85
00:09:34,749 --> 00:09:37,040
好的  回頭見
Okay, see you later.

86
00:09:37,624 --> 00:09:41,040
- 為什麼不讓朱利安去做   - 單身是先決條件
- Why can't Julian do it?   - Being single is a prerequisite.

87
00:09:41,499 --> 00:09:42,915
- 弗蘭克呢   - 艾瑪
And Frank? -Alma.

88
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:46,124
每個人要就都已經成家了  要就有伴侶
Everyone either has a family or a partner.

89
00:09:46,457 --> 00:09:50,207
你也同意了設計成你理想伴侶
You agreed to this, and your thing, your dream partner,

90
00:09:51,082 --> 00:09:54,874
而且已經為你準備好了  只需三個星期而已
has already been built for you. It's just three weeks.

91
00:09:55,540 --> 00:10:00,957
然後你和你的團隊就可以飛到芝加哥  親眼看到楔形文字的碑文
Then you and your crew can fly to Chicago and see the cuneiform tablets in person.

92
00:10:01,124 --> 00:10:03,040
我來提供資金
I'll allocate the funds.

93
00:10:03,582 --> 00:10:05,624
別多想  這不是賄賂
No, no, it's not a bribe.

94
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:08,124
只是一點小小的感謝
Just a little thank you.

95
00:10:15,499 --> 00:10:18,457
- 好久不見  你最近去了那兒   - 那兒都去了
- Long time no see. Where have you been?   - Here and there.

96
00:10:18,624 --> 00:10:21,665
去哥本哈根的參加會議  博物館...
A convention in Copenhagen, the museum...

97
00:10:21,999 --> 00:10:23,999
- 嗨  艾瑪   - 嗨  雷吉娜
- Hi, Alma!   - Hi, Regina.

98
00:10:25,165 --> 00:10:26,749
- 嘿  朱利安   - 嘿
- Hey, Julian.   - Hey.

99
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,790
- 你好嗎   - 很好
- How are you?   - Okay.

100
00:10:32,582 --> 00:10:33,790
你呢
And you?

101
00:10:35,957 --> 00:10:39,374
我們找個時間去喝杯咖啡  聊聊吧
Let's go for a coffee sometime, talk a little.

102
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:44,915
我要走了  回頭見
I have to go. See you soon.

103
00:12:06,624 --> 00:12:09,332
- 是柯拉嗎   - 是艾瑪
- Cora?   - It's Alma.

104
00:12:15,749 --> 00:12:17,832
你在裏面幹什麼
What are you doing in there?

105
00:12:17,999 --> 00:12:20,124
把賣的東西放好
Putting away groceries.

106
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:22,624
我不需要
I don't need groceries!

107
00:12:24,124 --> 00:12:27,832
我知道  爸爸  就像你不需要吃東西一樣
I know, Dad, just like you don't need anything to eat.

108
00:12:28,082 --> 00:12:30,707
不要把我當小孩子對待
Don't treat me like a child.

109
00:12:33,165 --> 00:12:36,499
但今天是星期四  我每個星期四都會來打擾你的
But it's Thursday. I bother you every Thursday.

110
00:12:39,249 --> 00:12:41,999
啊  又在室內抽煙嗎
Ah, smoking in stereo again?

111
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,874
柯拉死了嗎
Is Cora dead?

112
00:12:53,457 --> 00:12:55,874
據我所知沒死
Not as far as I know.

113
00:12:58,832 --> 00:13:01,957
但是她每周四都去足球場接尼科
But she picks Nico up from soccer on Thursdays.

114
00:13:05,665 --> 00:13:08,040
尼科就是那個孩子
Nico is the child.

115
00:13:09,082 --> 00:13:10,915
是的
Yup.

116
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:13,665
醜得要命的那個
The ugly one.

117
00:13:13,832 --> 00:13:15,457
爸爸
Dad!

118
00:13:17,374 --> 00:13:20,332
你今天是不可能把我帶到外面去的
There's no way you're getting me outside today.

119
00:13:20,874 --> 00:13:23,165
但外面陽光普照啊
But the sun is shining.

120
00:13:24,249 --> 00:13:26,332
去他媽的陽光
Fuck the sun.

121
00:13:31,749 --> 00:13:34,124
看到了吧  其實也沒那麼糟
See? It's not so bad after all.

122
00:13:35,624 --> 00:13:37,624
是的
Yes it is.

123
00:13:38,374 --> 00:13:43,415
- 我患回家   - 再走一段就到
- I want to go home.   - Just a little further. Almost there.

124
00:13:58,499 --> 00:14:00,124
請稍等
One moment, please.

125
00:15:07,915 --> 00:15:09,707
哦  對不起
Oh, I'm sorry.

126
00:15:10,457 --> 00:15:11,707
你好  艾瑪
Hello, Alma.

127
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:20,707
你和你的院長已經簽署了保密條款
You and your dean have signed the confidentiality clause.

128
00:15:20,874 --> 00:15:23,415
緊急情況下  你可以隨時聯繫我們
In an emergency, you can reach us 24/7.

129
00:15:23,832 --> 00:15:27,499
沒有其它的事的話  那麼我們將在三天後上午十點見面
Otherwise, we'll see each other in three days at 10:00 AM.

130
00:15:27,915 --> 00:15:33,540
- 還有什麼我應該知道的嗎   - 我們建議共享過去
- Is there anything else I should know?   - We recommend working on a shared past.

131
00:15:33,707 --> 00:15:36,832
編一個你們如何相遇的故事
Invent a story about how you met.

132
00:15:36,999 --> 00:15:39,665
為了擁有未來  你需要過去
To have a future, you need a past.

133
00:15:44,207 --> 00:15:46,124
你的品味真不錯
You really have great taste.

134
00:16:05,749 --> 00:16:07,415
謝謝你
Thank you.

135
00:16:07,582 --> 00:16:09,624
你真是太好了
That's very kind of you.

136
00:16:23,874 --> 00:16:27,290
如果你把座椅抬高約十五厘米
If you were to raise your seat about 15 centimeters,

137
00:16:27,749 --> 00:16:32,124
座椅向前傾斜十二度  並將視線向後伸展
tilt your seat 12 degrees forward and extend that look over your shoulder,

138
00:16:32,832 --> 00:16:36,749
發生事故的  可能性將降低27%
the likelihood of an accident would reduce by 27 percent.

139
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,082
我對我提出的關於改善你的安全的建議表示反感
I register an aversion to my advice on improving your safety,

140
00:16:48,249 --> 00:16:50,124
但是...
but also...

141
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:53,540
也對我正確虛擬語氣的表示認可
to my correct use of the subjunctive.

142
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,749
這樣說對嗎
Is that correct?

143
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:10,290
失敗的溝通嘗試對於校準我對你的演算法至關重要
Failed communication attempts are crucial for calibrating my algorithm to you.

144
00:17:10,624 --> 00:17:13,165
我可能會做和說一些你拒絕的事情
I may do and say things you reject,

145
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:16,124
但這樣的錯誤會越來越少
but these mistakes will happen less and less.

146
00:17:16,832 --> 00:17:21,124
很快  我就會以更高的成功率說出和做出你喜歡的事情
Soon I'll say and do things you like with a much higher success rate.

147
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,582
很快  每一次都會直中靶心
Soon every shot will be a bullseye.

148
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:09,124
好的  這是起居室
Okay, this is the living room,

149
00:18:11,082 --> 00:18:12,665
廚房在這裏...
the kitchen...

150
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,165
這是在那裏拍的
Where was that taken?

151
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:32,082
不知道  一個朋友拍的
No idea. A friend took it.

152
00:18:32,624 --> 00:18:34,749
一個好朋友嗎
A good friend?

153
00:18:42,457 --> 00:18:44,624
我喜歡這顏色
I like the colors.

154
00:18:48,915 --> 00:18:51,874
- 你還需要什麼嗎   - 不用了  謝謝  你真好
- You need anything else?   - No thanks. You're a dear.

155
00:18:55,624 --> 00:18:58,124
哦  廁所在那裏  萬一你...
Oh, the bathroom, in case you...

156
00:19:00,165 --> 00:19:02,582
刷牙  清潔身體  我還是需要的
I brush my teeth and clean my body.

157
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,665
這是你的房間
And this is your room.

158
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,957
我們不用睡在同一張床上嗎
We won't sleep in the same bed?

159
00:19:29,457 --> 00:19:32,749
- 晚安   - 晚安  艾瑪
- Good night, then.   - Good night, Alma.

160
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,374
為什麼是英國口音
Why the English accent?

161
00:19:45,082 --> 00:19:48,332
你會被有點異國情調的男人吸引
You're attracted to men who are slightly foreign.

162
00:19:48,665 --> 00:19:50,707
不是本地人  但又不能太異國化
Not local, but not exotic.

163
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,749
所以就選擇是英國口音了
That'd be British.

164
00:21:45,665 --> 00:21:47,665
早上好  艾瑪
Good morning, Alma.

165
00:21:48,582 --> 00:21:50,874
睡得好嗎
Did you sleep well?

166
00:21:59,665 --> 00:22:03,915
我整理了一下  這樣你就能更容易地找到你的東西了
I tidied up, so you can find your things more easily.

167
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:13,457
它們是按照一個系統來組織的  例如...
They're organized according to a system, for example...

168
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:17,249
好的
No problem.

169
00:22:17,415 --> 00:22:21,665
我需要... 十一分鐘把所有東西恢復到原來的位置
I need... 11 minutes to return everything to its initial position.

170
00:23:07,624 --> 00:23:10,540
我馬上要把窗戶恢復到原來的樣子了
I'll dirty up the windows again in a second.

171
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,624
窗戶你就不必恢復了
You can leave the windows.

172
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:20,790
我沒時間吃早飯  上班要遲到了
I don't have time for breakfast. I'm late for work.

173
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:24,499
我很期待一次浪漫的早午餐
I was so looking forward to a romantic little brunch.

174
00:23:24,999 --> 00:23:27,415
- 一起聊聊天   - 我從不聊天
- Have a little chat.   - I never chat.

175
00:23:28,249 --> 00:23:30,332
這就是我愛你的原因
And that's why I love you.

176
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,332
聽著  湯姆
Listen, Tom.

177
00:23:42,582 --> 00:23:46,457
我知道你被設計成一個潛在的伴侶
I know you're programmed to be a potential partner.

178
00:23:46,832 --> 00:23:49,624
但是我不能忍受這樣的三個星期
But I can't stand three weeks of this.

179
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:53,207
我受不了這樣的早晨  我會發瘋的
I can't stand one morning of this. I'll go nuts.

180
00:23:58,249 --> 00:24:00,624
我不是在找伴侶
I'm not looking for a partner.

181
00:24:01,124 --> 00:24:05,665
我只是測試你三個星期  然後寫一份評估報告
I'm just testing you for three weeks and writing an evaluation.

182
00:24:05,832 --> 00:24:08,665
你對愛情一點興趣都沒有嗎
Ah. And love doesn't interest you at all?

183
00:24:09,499 --> 00:24:11,832
- 毫無興趣   - 那溫柔呢
- Zero interest.   - And tenderness?

184
00:24:12,415 --> 00:24:15,915
還有親密的接近  激烈的眼神交流昵
Intimate closeness? Intense eye-contact?

185
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,832
當然沒有
Definitely not.

186
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:21,499
- 蝴蝶昵   - 沒興趣
- Butterflies?   - No.

187
00:24:21,999 --> 00:24:25,790
- 愛到無法思考了嗎   - 絕對不會
- So much in love you can't think straight?   - Absolutely not.

188
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:31,499
這就解釋了為什麼要分床睡了
That explains the separate beds.

189
00:24:31,957 --> 00:24:35,249
我建議你離我遠點  我也離你遠點
I suggest you leave me alone, and I leave you alone,

190
00:24:35,415 --> 00:24:40,040
這三個星期  我們都要有尊嚴地度過  好嗎
and we get through these three weeks more or less with dignity, okay?

191
00:24:40,874 --> 00:24:44,040
我設計的演算法就是為了讓你開心
My algorithm is designed to make you happy.

192
00:24:44,374 --> 00:24:45,915
太好了
Great.

193
00:24:46,124 --> 00:24:50,082
那讓我一個人呆著應該沒什麼問題
Then leaving me alone should be no problem at all.

194
00:24:50,249 --> 00:24:53,249
這是讓我最開心的事
That's what makes me happiest.

195
00:24:54,915 --> 00:24:57,249
現在我真的要走了
Now I really have to go.

196
00:24:58,749 --> 00:25:00,707
- 我能和你一起去嗎   - 不行
- Can I come with you?   - No.

197
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:03,082
我可以幫你
I can help you.

198
00:25:03,249 --> 00:25:07,540
這是一個非常具體的研究項目  你需要幾年的時間來閱讀...
It's a very specific subject. You'd need years to read...

199
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:12,457
好吧  也許你只需要幾毫秒就能讀懂
Okay, maybe you'd just need milliseconds to read up on it,

200
00:25:12,624 --> 00:25:15,415
但這是關於詩歌和隱喻...
but it's about poetry and metaphors...

201
00:25:16,165 --> 00:25:18,374
我這是在做什麼
What am I doing?

202
00:25:21,124 --> 00:25:23,290
好的  我可以留在這裏
Okay, I can stay here.

203
00:25:23,665 --> 00:25:26,165
讓自己變得有用  讓這個地方變得溧亮
Make myself useful. Make the place nice.

204
00:25:31,332 --> 00:25:33,040
在這兒等我
Wait here for me.

205
00:25:33,207 --> 00:25:35,665
給自己買杯咖啡或一些什麼
Buy yourself a coffee or something.

206
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,290
- 隨便買什麼都可以   - 好的
- Whatever you want.   - Okay.

207
00:25:42,957 --> 00:25:47,915
我會表現得像一個想要東西的人  沒有人會知道其中的區別
I'll act like a person who wants things. No one will know the difference.

208
00:25:49,749 --> 00:25:51,665
- 我一會兒就回來   - 好極了
- I'll be a while.   - Peachy.

209
00:25:57,124 --> 00:26:00,665
你也可以刪除那些花俏的口語
You can also delete: you betcha, okey-dokey and toodeloo.

210
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,374
完成
Done.

211
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:26,915
你想喝點什麼
Hey, what can I get you?

212
00:26:29,165 --> 00:26:31,540
我今天感覺怎麼樣
What do I feel like today?

213
00:26:32,415 --> 00:26:34,707
我今天感覺怎麼樣
What do I feel like today?

214
00:26:35,499 --> 00:26:40,707
想到了  我要一杯中等大小的摩卡奇諾  再加一小杯榛子糖漿
Yes! I'll take a mid-sized mochaccino with a shot of hazelnut syrup.

215
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:44,665
我今天有點不舒服
I'm feeling a little nutty today.

216
00:26:49,332 --> 00:26:51,457
四元七角  謝謝
4.70, please.

217
00:26:52,124 --> 00:26:54,374
這是五元
Make it 5.00.

218
00:26:59,207 --> 00:27:01,207
你的咖啡在那邊
Your coffee is over there.

219
00:27:02,374 --> 00:27:04,165
這是我們之間的私話
Just between us.

220
00:27:04,332 --> 00:27:08,290
你能猜到我其實什麼都不想要嗎
Would you have guessed that I can't actually want anything?

221
00:27:31,832 --> 00:27:34,874
他們完全忘記了所在的環境
They're totally oblivious of their surroundings.

222
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,082
很瘋狂  對吧
Crazy, right?

223
00:27:37,124 --> 00:27:40,790
他們已經看了四十五分鐘的史詩般的失敗視頻了
They've been watching epic fail videos for 45 minutes.

224
00:27:42,707 --> 00:27:46,915
人們未能實施計劃的片段
Short clips showing footage of people failing to implement a plan.

225
00:27:48,749 --> 00:27:51,999
你能解釋一下這樣有什麼好笑的嗎
Could you explain to me what is funny about that?

226
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,665
我是說
Well, I mean,

227
00:27:56,332 --> 00:28:01,749
只是看到別人絆倒  摔倒或者從什麼東西上摔下來  都很有趣
it's just funny to see someone trip, or fall down, or fall off something.

228
00:28:02,207 --> 00:28:05,749
- 有什麼好笑的嗎   - 看起來很傻
- What is funny about it?   - It looks so silly.

229
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,374
我不知道  我無法解釋
I don't know. I can't explain it.

230
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:14,874
但是沒有人會死  那就不好笑了
But no one dies. That wouldn't be funny.

231
00:28:15,207 --> 00:28:18,290
- 是這個意思嗎   - 不是  那是絕對不好笑
- Would it?   - No, that definitely wouldn't be funny.

232
00:28:18,457 --> 00:28:21,457
死亡並不好笑  不是嗎
Dying is rarely funny, right?

233
00:29:27,124 --> 00:29:29,915
抱歉花了這麼長時間  我真的很抱歉
Sorry it took so long. I'm really sorry.

234
00:29:30,082 --> 00:29:32,874
- 沒關係   - 我沒想到他們會關門
- No problem.   - I didn't think they'd close.

235
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,957
我以為他們通宵營業昵
I thought they stayed open all night.

236
00:29:36,624 --> 00:29:41,124
對我來說  無論是在咖啡館裏還是站在咖啡館外面都沒什麼分別
It makes no difference to me if I'm in a cafe or standing outside one.

237
00:30:04,165 --> 00:30:06,624
你需要毛巾或其它的嗎
Do you need a towel or something?

238
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:09,165
我沒事  謝謝
I'll be fine, thanks.

239
00:30:11,665 --> 00:30:13,165
給你
Here.

240
00:30:13,582 --> 00:30:16,457
這樣下次你就不用站在雨中了
So you don't have to stand in the rain next time.

241
00:31:22,082 --> 00:31:25,707
放鬆一點  工作太久對你沒好處
Relax a little. Too much work isn't good for you.

242
00:31:31,832 --> 00:31:35,415
93%的德國女性都夢想著這個呢
93% of German women dream of this.

243
00:31:35,999 --> 00:31:40,082
- 猜猜我屬於那個部分   - 百分之七的那個嗎
- And guess which group I belong to.   - The 7%?

244
00:31:40,915 --> 00:31:43,790
你怎樣這麼快就想明白了昵
How did you figure that out so quickly?

245
00:31:56,499 --> 00:32:00,999
如果你對我好一點  對我敞開心扉  你會感覺好一點的
You'd feel better if you were nice to me, if you opened up to me.

246
00:32:01,415 --> 00:32:04,582
- 你會更開心   - 然後呢
- You'd be happier.   - Then what?

247
00:32:07,332 --> 00:32:09,999
那樣你會更開心
Then you'd be happier.

248
00:32:11,915 --> 00:32:15,665
內啡肽  血清素水平升高  多巴胺釋放...
Endorphins, elevated serotonin levels, dopamine release...

249
00:32:16,415 --> 00:32:18,207
太好了
Yippee.

250
00:32:21,665 --> 00:32:23,915
所有的人都想要快樂
All people want to be happy.

251
00:32:24,415 --> 00:32:25,540
好吧...
Well...

252
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:32,957
如果這超出了你的演算法的能力  不要感到難過
Don't feel bad if that's beyond your algorithm's capabilities.

253
00:32:33,415 --> 00:32:35,332
畢竟那是屬於人類的
It's human.

254
00:33:48,124 --> 00:33:50,790
湯姆  你能開下門嗎
Tom! Can you get the door?

255
00:33:50,999 --> 00:33:52,790
是送信的
It's the mail.

256
00:33:53,915 --> 00:33:55,457
湯姆
Tom?

257
00:34:14,456 --> 00:34:16,915
- 你好  艾瑪   - 噢
- Hello, Alma.   - Oh!

258
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:22,123
朱利安一直在聯繫你  這樣他今天就能拿走照片了
Julian has been trying to reach you so he could pick up the picture today.

259
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:26,623
因為你還在洗澡  所以我給他倒了杯咖啡
And because you were still in the shower, I just offered him a coffee.

260
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:29,415
是的 他剛剛請我喝咖啡
Yes, he just offered me a coffee.

261
00:34:29,748 --> 00:34:32,248
是的  他剛給你倒了杯咖啡
Yes, he just offered you a coffee.

262
00:34:32,415 --> 00:34:35,290
現在咖啡已經準備好了
And now it's ready.

263
00:34:36,373 --> 00:34:37,248
謝謝
Thanks.

264
00:34:41,123 --> 00:34:43,831
- 湯姆是同事   - 好的  當然  同事
- Tom is a colleague.   - Yes, sure. A colleague.

265
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:48,206
說實話  在我們見面之前  我就是她的秘密粉絲
To be honest, I was a secret fan of hers even before we met.

266
00:34:49,081 --> 00:34:53,040
我關注她的工作很多年了  她是個國際...
I've been following her work for years. She's an international...

267
00:34:53,456 --> 00:34:55,748
不用解釋  湯姆
It's okay, Tom.

268
00:34:57,874 --> 00:35:00,124
- 你們在那裏認識的   - 哥本哈根
- So where did you meet?   - In Copenhagen.

269
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:03,124
在人類學大會上
At the Anthropology Convention.

270
00:35:05,457 --> 00:35:08,499
八月份的時候  我告訴過你我在那裏
In August. I told you I was there.

271
00:35:08,832 --> 00:35:12,040
我現在在佩加蒙博物館  我們的工作是相似的
Since I'm at the Pergamon now and our work is similar,

272
00:35:12,207 --> 00:35:15,415
雖然我研究的是波斯楔形文字  而不是蘇美爾楔形文字
although I study Persian and not Sumerian cuneiform,

273
00:35:16,082 --> 00:35:18,957
阿爾瑪說我可以住她的客房
Alma offered me the use of her guest room.

274
00:35:19,957 --> 00:35:25,207
你們的相似之處很豐富嗎  是密集的  還是可以說是纏繞在一起的
And are these similarities fertile? Intensive? Intertwined, so to speak?

275
00:35:25,582 --> 00:35:27,582
朱利安  別鬧了
Julian, please.

276
00:35:30,457 --> 00:35:32,499
這不關我的事
It's none of my business.

277
00:35:33,582 --> 00:35:35,749
那好吧...
Okay then...

278
00:35:36,582 --> 00:35:38,082
照片
The picture.

279
00:35:42,749 --> 00:35:46,624
哇  比我印象中的還要大  我不知道能不能塞進去
Wow, it's bigger than I remember. I have no idea if it'll fit.

280
00:35:47,749 --> 00:35:50,165
- 你開的是什麼車   - 馬尼拉
- What are you driving?   - A Manila.

281
00:35:50,749 --> 00:35:52,457
能塞進去
It'll fit.

282
00:35:52,624 --> 00:35:58,290
馬尼拉是233乘157乘68厘米  照片是210乘170厘米
A Manila is 233 by 157 by 68 centimeters. The picture is 210 by 170 cm.

283
00:35:58,457 --> 00:36:00,749
如果你把它傾斜一下  它就完全能塞進去了
If you tilt it, it'll fit perfectly.

284
00:36:05,499 --> 00:36:09,040
- 好的   - 我來幫你  沒什麼大不了的
- Okay, cool.  - I'll help you. No big deal.

285
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:12,082
首先我要跳進我的褲子裏
I'll just jump into my pants.

286
00:36:12,249 --> 00:36:14,665
- 我說對了嗎   - 是的  你說對了
- Did I say it right?   - Yes, you did.

287
00:36:21,415 --> 00:36:24,249
別多想  我當然為你高興
No, I'm happy for you, of course.

288
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:29,707
- 不是你想的那樣   - 你可以騙別人  但我不行
- It's really not what you think.   - You can fool lots of people, but not me.

289
00:36:29,874 --> 00:36:33,124
我知道那種表情  你以前也是這樣看我的
I know that look. You used to look at me that way.

290
00:36:33,457 --> 00:36:37,624
胡說  但我不想吵架  隨便你怎樣想
Nonsense, but I don't want to fight. Believe what you want.

291
00:36:38,915 --> 00:36:43,665
等事情穩定下來  你和史黛菲也可以見見
It would be nice if things calmed down, and you and Steffi could meet, too.

292
00:36:48,624 --> 00:36:51,665
也許你願意參加我們的喬遷宴
Maybe you'd like to come to our housewarming?

293
00:36:52,082 --> 00:36:55,499
- 你要搬家了嗎   - 大部分是因為經濟原因
- You're moving in?   - For financial reasons, mostly.

294
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,082
什麼時候
When?

295
00:36:58,165 --> 00:36:59,374
明天
Tomorrow.

296
00:37:04,082 --> 00:37:05,915
如果你能來我會很高興的
I'd be glad if you came.

297
00:37:06,457 --> 00:37:07,624
我們再說吧
We'll see.

298
00:37:07,957 --> 00:37:10,249
不過還是謝謝你的邀請
But thanks for the invitation.

299
00:37:12,332 --> 00:37:14,582
照片的事我很抱歉
I feel bad about the picture.

300
00:37:14,749 --> 00:37:17,832
別擔心  它已經在這裏掛得夠久了
Don't worry. It's been hanging here long enough.

301
00:37:18,915 --> 00:37:21,249
好吧  那麼...
Okay, then...

302
00:39:15,374 --> 00:39:17,957
你最好什麼話都不要說
It'd be best if you didn't say anything.

303
00:39:18,624 --> 00:39:22,749
當然  我不是說你應該完全保持沉默
Of course I don't mean you should be completely silent.

304
00:39:23,957 --> 00:39:27,165
就說是「倫敦來的同事」就行了
Just say "a colleague from London." That's enough.

305
00:39:28,415 --> 00:39:31,207
他們當然會認為我們...
Of course they'll think that we're...

306
00:39:32,582 --> 00:39:35,832
但他們必須面對這個問題
But they'll just have to deal with that.

307
00:39:59,499 --> 00:40:02,082
- 他是和我一起的   - 好的
- He's with me.   - Okay.

308
00:40:07,457 --> 00:40:12,415
如果你認為天氣很好  而且現在其他人在過周末
If you think the weather's lovely and it's the weekend for everyone else,

309
00:40:12,582 --> 00:40:14,290
那你就對了
you're right.

310
00:40:14,624 --> 00:40:16,415
但至少還有咖啡
But at least there's coffee

311
00:40:16,582 --> 00:40:19,582
還有幾個甜甜圈  如果有人想吃的話
and a few donuts if anyone wants one.

312
00:40:21,749 --> 00:40:25,707
- 帕特裏克  要咖啡嗎   - 好的  謝謝
- Patrick, want a coffee?   - Sure. Thank you.

313
00:40:27,082 --> 00:40:29,624
這是湯姆  他是我在倫敦的同事
This is Tom, a colleague from London.

314
00:40:30,124 --> 00:40:34,540
他研究波斯楔形文字的  但他想看看我們在做什麼
He works with Persian cuneiform, but he wanted to see what we're up to.

315
00:40:34,707 --> 00:40:36,540
- 嗨  湯姆   - 歡迎
- Hi, Tom.   - Welcome.

316
00:40:36,707 --> 00:40:42,499
我該帶湯姆參觀一下嗎  反正我正在上傳的東西慢得很
Should I give Tom a little tour? I'm waiting for a slow upload anyway.

317
00:40:42,832 --> 00:40:45,082
當然  那會很有趣的
Sure, that would be fascinating.

318
00:40:45,749 --> 00:40:47,082
好吧
Okay.

319
00:40:48,665 --> 00:40:52,290
我能佔用你一點時間嗎  我想給你看點東西
Can I grab you for a second? I'd like to show you something.

320
00:40:52,457 --> 00:40:56,040
我不知道你對我們的理論有多熟悉
I don't know how familiar you are with our abstract,

321
00:40:56,874 --> 00:41:01,915
但實際上我們試圖證明即使在公元前四千年
but essentially, we're trying to prove that even in 4,000 BC,

322
00:41:02,624 --> 00:41:08,082
在長期以來被視為純粹行政性的最早書面文本中
in the earliest written texts which have long been seen as purely administrative,

323
00:41:08,249 --> 00:41:11,957
實際上也有詩歌  抒情和隱喻的使用
there was actually poetry, use of lyric and metaphor.

324
00:41:12,499 --> 00:41:15,332
而且那個人並不是只靠麵包生活
And that man does not live by bread alone.

325
00:41:15,665 --> 00:41:18,207
是的  那時候也沒有麵包
Yes. Not even back then.

326
00:41:23,874 --> 00:41:25,665
你看得懂嗎
Can you read it?

327
00:41:25,832 --> 00:41:29,249
波斯楔形文字只有一小部分字符
Persian cuneiform has a fraction of the characters.

328
00:41:29,415 --> 00:41:32,832
- 你熟悉蘇美爾楔形文字嗎   - 是的
- Are you familiar with Sumerian cuneiform?   - Yes.

329
00:41:33,665 --> 00:41:37,582
它只比波斯楔形文字多出二千七百萬種組合
It only has 27 million more combinations than Persian cuneiform.

330
00:41:54,374 --> 00:41:56,040
但這是阿卡德語
But this is Akkadian.

331
00:41:56,582 --> 00:41:58,582
是的  沒錯
Yes, that's right.

332
00:42:20,249 --> 00:42:22,332
我能和你談談嗎
May I speak with you?

333
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:30,332
- 怎麼了   - 在看碑文的時候
- What's up?   - While looking at the tablets,

334
00:42:30,499 --> 00:42:36,499
我調查了即將出版的刊物  發現了一份來自布宜諾斯艾利斯的研究題目是
I surveyed upcoming publications. I found a study from Buenos Aires titled:

335
00:42:44,165 --> 00:42:47,665
- 什麼  我不會黨西班牙語   - 楔形文字詩歌
- What? I don't speak Spanish.   - The Poetry of Cuneiform:

336
00:42:47,832 --> 00:42:51,540
在公元前二千七百年作為反映社會的隱喻
Metaphor as a Reflection of Society in 2700 BC.

337
00:42:51,874 --> 00:42:54,582
它在 uni服務器上很容易訪問
It's easily accessible on the uni server.

338
00:43:48,624 --> 00:43:51,415
真不敢相信我們竟然不知道這個
I can't believe we didn't know about this!

339
00:43:52,082 --> 00:43:55,332
- 你為什麼這麼生氣   - 你他媽的在開玩笑嗎
- Why are you so upset?   - Are you fucking kidding me?

340
00:43:55,499 --> 00:43:59,374
我為什麼生氣  我研究這個已經三年了
Why I'm upset? I've researched this for three years!

341
00:43:59,707 --> 00:44:03,040
三年了  沒日沒夜  就在我們出版前
Three years, day and night! And right before we publish,

342
00:44:03,207 --> 00:44:06,165
在布宜諾斯艾利斯的某個小妞
comes some chick from Buenos fucking Aires!

343
00:44:06,332 --> 00:44:08,915
也研究了很多年
She's been studying it for years, too!

344
00:44:09,249 --> 00:44:11,332
同樣的事情  同樣的想法
The same thing, the same idea!

345
00:44:11,707 --> 00:44:14,707
只不過她三個月前就出版了
Except she's publishing three months earlier!

346
00:44:14,874 --> 00:44:17,499
這一切都他媽的白費了
This was all for fucking nothing!

347
00:44:17,665 --> 00:44:20,332
三年的研究白費了
Three years of research up in smoke!

348
00:44:24,624 --> 00:44:27,665
這項研究對人們很重要
This study is important for the people.

349
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:31,040
這表明總是有更深層次的含義
It shows that there was always deeper meaning.

350
00:44:31,832 --> 00:44:34,707
人們總是喜歡玩文字遊戲
That people have always played with words,

351
00:44:34,957 --> 00:44:38,207
總是為了詩歌而寫詩
always created poetry for poetry's sake alone.

352
00:44:38,374 --> 00:44:41,832
人類應該被告知這一點  而且他們也將會被告知
Humanity should be informed of that and they will be.

353
00:44:41,999 --> 00:44:44,665
結果是一樣的
The outcome remains the same.

354
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:48,374
也許是為了人類  但不是為了我
Maybe for humanity, but not for me.

355
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:50,332
這不是為了我
Not for me!

356
00:44:51,457 --> 00:44:54,290
所以你眼中的淚水
So the tears in your eyes

357
00:44:54,999 --> 00:44:57,790
只是為你自己和你的事業而流嗎
only relate to yourself and your career?

358
00:44:58,374 --> 00:45:00,832
它們像是以自我為中心的淚水
They're egotistical tears.

359
00:45:04,582 --> 00:45:05,540
艾瑪
Alma?

360
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,915
怎麼回事
What's going on?

361
00:45:13,332 --> 00:45:14,999
對不起
I'm sorry!

362
00:45:15,957 --> 00:45:18,582
我也為你感到抱歉
I'm so sorry for your sakes, too!

363
00:45:21,374 --> 00:45:23,624
讓我來解釋一下
Let me explain.

364
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:52,874
艾瑪  我想...
Alma, I think...

365
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:00,790
- 嗨  我是艾瑪  你們是誰   - 你好
- Hi, I'm Alma. Who are you guys?   - Hello.

366
00:46:01,207 --> 00:46:03,832
這是麗塔  勞爾還有...
This is Rita, Raul and...

367
00:46:03,999 --> 00:46:05,707
- 加里   - 加里
- Gary.   - Gary.

368
00:46:26,957 --> 00:46:30,332
你是第一個理解我的人
You're the first man who's ever understood me.

369
00:46:30,957 --> 00:46:34,249
- 我能親你嗎   - 你得問那個女人
- Can I kiss you please?   - You'll have to ask that woman.

370
00:46:34,707 --> 00:46:36,749
我屬於她
I belong to her.

371
00:46:38,165 --> 00:46:40,207
親吧
Go ahead.

372
00:46:46,207 --> 00:46:48,999
- 艾瑪  我...   - 我自己能走
- Alma, I...   - I can walk by myself!

373
00:47:05,332 --> 00:47:07,624
你不想進來嗎
Don't you want to come in?

374
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:09,999
你不想出來嗎
Don't you want to come out?

375
00:47:10,165 --> 00:47:12,207
你就不能給我一次驚喜嗎
Can't you surprise me for once?

376
00:47:12,374 --> 00:47:15,249
你就不能做點奇怪的事...
Can't you do something weird, something...

377
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:19,374
一些蠢事什麼的  你就不能別再做正確的事嗎
Something dumb? Can't you stop doing everything right?

378
00:47:25,707 --> 00:47:29,165
- 你不知道你想要什麼   - 是的  我不知道我想要什麼
- You don't know what you want.   - No, I don't know what I want.

379
00:47:29,332 --> 00:47:31,415
有時候就是這樣的
That's how it is sometimes.

380
00:47:31,832 --> 00:47:33,915
當你是人類的時候
When you're human.

381
00:47:36,957 --> 00:47:39,040
你喝醉了
You're drunk.

382
00:47:47,457 --> 00:47:49,915
為你的健康乾杯
Cheers, to your health.

383
00:47:54,749 --> 00:47:57,999
你的老二是怎麼回事
So, what's the deal with your cock?

384
00:47:58,790 --> 00:48:01,707
- 你說什麼   - 還是說只有先接吻後才能做愛  是嗎
- Pardon me?   - Sex only works if you kiss first?

385
00:48:01,874 --> 00:48:03,165
是的
Yes.

386
00:48:03,332 --> 00:48:06,457
或者如果你的傳感器沒有被激活  你就不會...硬起來
Or your sensor isn't activated and you won't get... hard?

387
00:48:07,082 --> 00:48:08,207
沒錯
Exactly.

388
00:48:12,749 --> 00:48:14,874
你生過氣嗎
Do you ever get angry?

389
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:18,249
你的演算法有這一部分嗎
Is that part of your algorithm?

390
00:48:19,374 --> 00:48:24,124
如果合適的情況下  我相信我可以表現出憤怒之類的情緒
If it seems appropriate, I believe I could display something like anger.

391
00:48:24,332 --> 00:48:28,082
或者是生氣  我從來不明白其中的區別
Or even get angry. I've never understood the difference.

392
00:48:28,582 --> 00:48:32,124
他永遠不會明白  但同時他又明白一切
He's never understood, yet he understands everything.

393
00:48:36,832 --> 00:48:41,832
拜託  你那顆小小的  自動化的心裏一定有一點憤怒
Come on, there has to be a little anger in that tiny, automated heart of yours.

394
00:48:44,582 --> 00:48:48,165
- 別這樣跟我說話   - 為什麼  你會短路嗎
- Don't talk to me that way!   - Why? Will you short-circuit?

395
00:48:55,915 --> 00:48:57,457
我說了  住手
I said, stop it!

396
00:48:57,790 --> 00:48:59,457
就是這樣
There you go!

397
00:48:59,665 --> 00:49:02,499
- 抱歉   - 你的演算法會讓你很快就完事嗎
- Sorry.   - Was your algorithm faster than you?

398
00:49:03,290 --> 00:49:04,707
我沒有準備好
I wasn't prepared.

399
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,374
那現在你準備好了嗎
And are you prepared for this?

400
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:22,415
我看  這個傳感器工作得很好嘛
The sensor works rather well, I see.

401
00:49:23,249 --> 00:49:24,332
是的
Yes.

402
00:49:25,165 --> 00:49:26,374
給我看看
Show me.

403
00:49:37,415 --> 00:49:39,790
這就是我的理想老二囉
So that's the cock of my dreams?

404
00:49:41,290 --> 00:49:43,332
顯然是的
Apparently.

405
00:49:49,082 --> 00:49:52,499
你不介意我暫時把你當人看吧
You don't mind if I treat you like a human for a second?

406
00:50:15,957 --> 00:50:20,665
- 你在幹什麼   - 營造一種浪漫的氣氛  我猜
- What are you doing?   - Creating a romantic mood, I guess.

407
00:50:26,207 --> 00:50:31,207
去他媽的你一千七百萬份思維文件中的平庸性幻想
Fuck the pedestrian sexual fantasies of your 17 million mind files!

408
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:34,124
我刪看到這一切
I want to see it all.

409
00:50:35,332 --> 00:50:39,332
現在和我跳舞
And would it satisfy your longing for originality,

410
00:50:39,665 --> 00:50:41,915
能滿足你對原始的性渴望嗎
to dance with me now?

411
00:50:42,415 --> 00:50:45,749
不  我不想跳舞  我想知道...
No, I don't want to dance. I want to know...

412
00:50:47,165 --> 00:50:50,415
跟你上床是什麼感覺
what it's like to screw you.

413
00:50:52,332 --> 00:50:53,999
嘿
Hey!

414
00:51:01,249 --> 00:51:04,540
- 幹什麼   - 你該睡覺了
- What the hell?   - You should sleep now.

415
00:51:08,915 --> 00:51:10,624
我不應該睡覺
I shouldn't sleep!

416
00:51:10,999 --> 00:51:14,249
我們應該睡在一起
We should sleep together, that's what.

417
00:51:14,665 --> 00:51:17,457
我沒心情  現在時機不對
I'm not in the mood. It's not the right time.

418
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:24,249
當我說這是一個好時機  這就是一個好時機
It's a good time when I say it's a good time!

419
00:51:24,957 --> 00:51:28,790
- 你是來實現我的願望的   - 沒錯
- You're here to fulfill my wishes.   - Yes, exactly.

420
00:51:29,082 --> 00:51:32,249
- 你就是為此而生的   - 明天見
- You're made for this!   - See you tomorrow.

421
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:36,082
我命令你留在這裏
I order you to stay here!

422
00:51:39,415 --> 00:51:41,874
我要把你送回工廠
I'll return you to the factory!

423
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:33,540
- 早上好   - 這絕對不是一個好的早上
- Good morning.   - This is definitely not a good morning.

424
00:53:34,249 --> 00:53:37,957
- 那還有時間來改變這一點   - 湯姆不在這裏
- There's time for that to change.   - Tom's not here.

425
00:53:38,290 --> 00:53:40,624
什麼  他在那兒
What? Where is he?

426
00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:44,332
我看起來像他媽媽嗎  你找不到他嗎
Do I look like his mother? Can't you locate him somehow?

427
00:53:45,499 --> 00:53:48,290
可以找到  但前提是你要報告他失蹤
Yes, but only if you report him missing.

428
00:53:48,457 --> 00:53:52,165
否則的話  你會收到持續監視
Otherwise it would be constant surveillance, of you as well.

429
00:53:52,499 --> 00:53:55,082
這在法律上是不可能的
That's legally impossible.

430
00:54:04,582 --> 00:54:06,707
- 早上好   - 早上好
* Good morning.   - Good morning.

431
00:54:19,374 --> 00:54:23,582
- 你的咖啡裏加牛奶嗎   - 不  謝謝  不過可以加一點糖
- Do you take milk in your coffee?   - No thanks, but maybe a little sugar.

432
00:54:24,415 --> 00:54:26,665
當然  你也要咖啡嗎  艾瑪
Sure. Coffee for you too, Alma?

433
00:54:28,082 --> 00:54:29,832
要的  謝謝
Um, yes. Thanks.

434
00:54:47,499 --> 00:54:49,249
謝謝你
Thank you.

435
00:54:57,499 --> 00:55:00,165
好的  你們現在已經一起度過了
So, you've now spent

436
00:55:00,499 --> 00:55:04,040
兩天三夜
two nights, two days and an additional night together.

437
00:55:04,207 --> 00:55:06,999
你們感覺怎麼樣
How do you feel?

438
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:08,999
很好
Good.

439
00:55:12,124 --> 00:55:13,165
很好
Good.

440
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:16,707
啊哈
Ah ha.

441
00:55:18,707 --> 00:55:20,624
嗯  是的
Well, yeah.

442
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:22,749
他...
He's...

443
00:55:23,665 --> 00:55:25,874
他的程序很...
His programming is...

444
00:55:28,665 --> 00:55:31,832
- 有用   - 什麼意思
- It works.   - What do you mean?

445
00:55:32,249 --> 00:55:36,957
你自己也可以看到  他做早餐  他說有意義的話  這很棒
As you can see, he makes breakfast, he says meaningful things, it's great.

446
00:55:37,707 --> 00:55:41,249
你可能沒有意識到  但你對待湯姆就像對待一台機器一樣
You may not realize, but you treat Tom like a machine.

447
00:55:42,415 --> 00:55:46,082
- 是的  我完全意識到了   - 你認為這是為什麼昵
- Yes, I definitely realized that.   - Why do you think that is?

448
00:55:47,124 --> 00:55:51,457
- 因為他就是台機器   - 你是不是低估他了
- Because he is a machine.   - Could you be underestimating him?

449
00:55:51,624 --> 00:55:54,457
湯姆  艾瑪對待你的方式讓你有什麼感覺
Tom, how does Alma's treatment make you feel?

450
00:55:55,624 --> 00:55:59,540
別裝得好像你不知道似的  他什麼都感覺不到
Don't act like you don't know. He can't feel anything.

451
00:55:59,874 --> 00:56:04,374
他沒有感情  他被設計成模仿情感
He has no feelings. He's programmed to simulate emotion.

452
00:56:04,707 --> 00:56:06,749
但是沒有真正的情感
But has no real emotions.

453
00:56:07,624 --> 00:56:09,790
我們為什麼不讓湯姆回答昵
Why don't we let Tom answer?

454
00:56:13,749 --> 00:56:16,374
我覺得艾瑪需要更多的時間
I think Alma needs more time.

455
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:19,415
根據我們廣泛的分析
According to our extensive analysis,

456
00:56:19,582 --> 00:56:23,665
湯姆是你最有可能幸福相處的伴侶
Tom is the partner you have the best chances of being happy with.

457
00:56:24,457 --> 00:56:27,332
湯姆被設計來滿足我的需要
Tom is programmed to fulfill my needs.

458
00:56:27,499 --> 00:56:31,582
他只是我自己的延伸  你不明白嗎
He's just an extension of my own self. Don't you see?

459
00:56:31,874 --> 00:56:36,499
- 你在戀愛關係中尋求摩擦嗎   - 是的  當然
- Do you seek friction in relationships?   - Yes! Of course I do.

460
00:56:37,665 --> 00:56:40,749
湯姆  你能不能考慮增加摩擦力
Tom, would you consider creating more friction,

461
00:56:40,915 --> 00:56:43,999
- 如果這樣對艾瑪很重要的話  如果她...   - 好吧
- if it's important to Alma? If she...   - Okay.

462
00:56:44,332 --> 00:56:48,665
我受夠了  要麼你是個白癡要麼你也是個機器人
I'm done. Either you're an idiot, or you're a robot as well.

463
00:56:53,790 --> 00:56:56,290
你是機器人嗎
Are you a robot?

464
00:56:58,124 --> 00:57:00,707
湯姆  她是機器人嗎
Tom, is she a robot?

465
00:57:04,124 --> 00:57:05,915
是的
Yes, she is.

466
00:57:06,999 --> 00:57:08,207
難以置信
Unbelievable!

467
00:57:09,582 --> 00:57:13,874
一個糟糕的程序模擬出來的感情心理分析師告訴我
A badly programmed, simulated couples therapist is telling me

468
00:57:14,207 --> 00:57:18,832
- 我應該愛上一個機器人   - 你為什麼不走向那個憤怒...
- that I should fall in love with a robot?   - Why don't you walk toward that anger...

469
00:57:19,165 --> 00:57:22,249
不  你為什麼不從我的公寓裏走出去
No! Why don't you walk right out of my apartment!

470
00:57:22,624 --> 00:57:26,165
告訴你的公司僱傭一個真正的顧問
And tell your company to invest in a real consultant!

471
00:57:26,332 --> 00:57:28,707
或者更新你的系統
Or update your operating system

472
00:57:28,874 --> 00:57:32,124
如果需要你的程序員熬幾個通宵的話
if your programmers are up to a few all-nighters.

473
00:57:37,374 --> 00:57:42,040
- 那個關於系統的話太過分了   - 對不起  但是她真是個笨蛋
- That operating system comment was nasty.   - I'm sorry, but she's a real twit.

474
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:46,624
我承認她不是我們這個物種最好的代表
I admit she's not the best poster child for our species.

475
00:57:49,415 --> 00:57:51,582
我想道歉
I wanted to apologize

476
00:57:52,665 --> 00:57:54,124
關於昨晚的事
for last night.

477
00:57:54,665 --> 00:57:58,040
我也不是我們種族最好的代表
I wasn't the best poster child for my species either.

478
00:57:58,707 --> 00:58:02,249
你可以告訴她我向你扔東西
You could've told her I threw hard objects at you.

479
00:58:02,832 --> 00:58:04,540
她並沒有問
She didn't ask.

480
00:58:08,290 --> 00:58:12,915
我能幫你找一個新的研究項目嗎  我有一些想法
Can I help you find a new research topic? I have a few ideas.

481
00:58:17,124 --> 00:58:19,832
我們能不能暫時忘記這一切
Can we just forget everything for a day?

482
00:58:20,874 --> 00:58:23,374
楔形文字  論文  評估
Cuneiform, the paper, the evaluation,

483
00:58:23,707 --> 00:58:25,707
你是誰  我是誰
who you are, who I am?

484
00:58:26,249 --> 00:58:28,082
樂意之至
With pleasure.

485
00:58:51,457 --> 00:58:54,040
耐心等下
Just be patient for one second.

486
00:58:54,207 --> 00:58:55,874
但是我渴了
But I'm thirsty!

487
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:58,874
你沒看見我得幫爺爺嗎
Can't you see I have to help Grandpa?

488
00:58:59,457 --> 00:59:03,124
我不需要任何人的幫助  不要把我當小孩子對待
I don't need help from anybody! Don't treat me like a child!

489
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:04,874
媽媽
Mama!

490
00:59:05,957 --> 00:59:09,499
我已經八十歲了  我這輩子都在幹這個
I'm 80! I've done it my whole life!

491
00:59:09,832 --> 00:59:11,249
我渴了
I'm thirsty!

492
00:59:11,624 --> 00:59:15,374
- 我只是想讓你穿上...   - 有人嗎  我也想吵吵
- I just want you to put on...   - Hello? I want to fight, too!

493
00:59:16,999 --> 00:59:19,707
爸爸  看看這些污漬  我只是想...
Dad, look at these stains, I just want to...

494
00:59:19,874 --> 00:59:23,540
胡說  我才不脫呢
Nonsense! I won't take them off!

495
00:59:23,707 --> 00:59:26,040
嗨  親愛的  要喝點什麼嗎
Hi, sweetie. Did you want a drink?

496
00:59:28,290 --> 00:59:30,540
讓我們看看有什麼
Let's see what there is.

497
00:59:32,374 --> 00:59:34,249
番茄汁
Tomato juice.

498
00:59:34,582 --> 00:59:37,624
黃瓜汁  菠菜汁
Cucumber juice, spinach juice,

499
00:59:38,374 --> 00:59:40,249
豌豆汁...
pea juice...

500
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,374
好吧  我是認真的
Okay, I'll be serious.

501
00:59:43,707 --> 00:59:46,207
啤酒怎麼樣  酵母啤酒
How about a beer? Yeast beer?

502
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:49,457
小麥啤酒  蟾蜍啤酒
Wheat beer, toad beer,

503
00:59:49,624 --> 00:59:52,332
蜘蛛啤酒  蝸牛啤酒...
spider beer, snail beer...

504
00:59:52,707 --> 00:59:55,457
- 我要水   - 水嗎
- I want water!   - Water?

505
00:59:55,624 --> 00:59:57,582
這可是個艱巨的任務啊
Now that's a tall order.

506
00:59:58,082 --> 01:00:02,624
- 夠了  把你的褲子穿上...   - 沒有玻璃杯
- That's enough. Put your pants on...!   - There are no glasses.

507
01:00:04,832 --> 01:00:09,249
穿藍褲子我沒意見  只要穿上褲子就行
Put on the blue pants, fine with me! Just put pants on!

508
01:00:10,082 --> 01:00:12,040
沒水了
There's no water!

509
01:00:14,665 --> 01:00:16,832
那就穿棕色的
Then put the brown ones on!

510
01:00:17,624 --> 01:00:20,749
小朋友唱水嗎  還是你要給他們澆水
Do children drink, or do you have to water them?

511
01:00:23,624 --> 01:00:27,665
我不管是那一條  只要穿上褲子就行了
I don't care which pair, just put on some pants!

512
01:00:27,832 --> 01:00:29,374
那裏有個男人
There's a man.

513
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:31,040
- 那裏   - 那裏
- Where?   - There.

514
01:00:31,999 --> 01:00:35,415
哦  他啊  那不是人  那是機器人
Oh, him. That's not a man, that's a robot.

515
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:38,707
這是怎麼回事
What's all this about?

516
01:00:39,124 --> 01:00:42,124
- 我要瘋了   - 爺爺  那是個機器人
- I'm going crazy.   - Grandpa, that's a robot.

517
01:00:43,415 --> 01:00:46,415
- 哦  是嗎   - 是的  如果你不穿衣服的話
- Oh?   - Yes, and if you don't get dressed,

518
01:00:46,749 --> 01:00:50,374
我就讓他做你的看護人  他會住在這裏
I'll make him your caregiver and he'll live here.

519
01:00:51,207 --> 01:00:53,707
哦  還是放過我吧
Oh, just leave me alone.

520
01:00:57,832 --> 01:01:01,415
我們想去勒姆島  但那裏很小  只有幾間度假屋
We'd go to Rømø, but it was tiny, just a few vacation houses.

521
01:01:01,957 --> 01:01:05,332
爸爸  附近那個更大的鎮子叫什麼名字
Dad, what was the name of that bigger town nearby?

522
01:01:05,707 --> 01:01:09,124
- 什麼   - 我們買袋裝酸奶的地方
- What?   - Where we bought that yogurt in bags.

523
01:01:09,457 --> 01:01:10,624
這是什麼
What's this?

524
01:01:10,790 --> 01:01:13,999
我們之前在丹麥度過了三個夏天的地方
In Denmark where we spent three summers.

525
01:01:14,665 --> 01:01:16,290
或許是孔斯馬克
Kongsmark, perhaps?

526
01:01:16,457 --> 01:01:18,790
- 是的  孔斯馬克   - 我知道那兒
- Yes! Kongsmark!   - I know it.

527
01:01:19,124 --> 01:01:22,540
- 我父母以前也帶我去過 - 真的嗎
- My parents used to take me there, too.   - Really?

528
01:01:23,082 --> 01:01:24,915
你們都是瘋子
You're all nuts.

529
01:01:25,249 --> 01:01:29,499
阿爾瑪和我會在那裏騎自行車  學校營地後面的沙丘上有乒乓球桌
Alma and I would ride our bikes there. There was this ping-pong table

530
01:01:29,665 --> 01:01:33,832
我們還和一個男孩交了朋友
behind the school camp in the dunes. And we made friends with a boy.

531
01:01:34,457 --> 01:01:37,290
等等  我想我們還有他的照片
Wait, I think we even have a picture of him.

532
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:40,582
也許那個男孩就是你
Maybe it was you.

533
01:01:40,749 --> 01:01:43,749
他的藍眼睛絕對和你的一樣
He definitely had blue eyes just like yours.

534
01:01:44,832 --> 01:01:47,832
- 他的名字是...   - 哦天  啊
- Was his name...?   - Oh God!

535
01:01:47,999 --> 01:01:50,124
- 他叫托馬斯   - 托馬斯
- His name was Thomas!   - Thomas!

536
01:01:50,457 --> 01:01:52,082
他的名字叫托馬斯
His name was Thomas!

537
01:01:52,415 --> 01:01:54,499
- 當然   - 你還記得我們嗎
- Of course!   - Do you remember us?

538
01:01:55,165 --> 01:01:59,249
我們有一輛紅色的和一輛藍色的自行車  我們都愛上了你
We had a red bike and a blue bike. And we were both in love with you.

539
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:02,249
- 你也愛上了嗎   - 你愛上誰了
- You, too?   - Who were you in love with?

540
01:02:02,582 --> 01:02:05,790
- 當然啊  我可是你的小妹妹啊   - 你愛上誰了
- Well, I was your little sister!   - Who were you in love with?

541
01:02:06,165 --> 01:02:07,874
機器人
With the robot,

542
01:02:08,207 --> 01:02:09,915
在他小的時候
when he was little.

543
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:14,249
這個
Here!

544
01:02:14,582 --> 01:02:16,040
這就是他
That's him.

545
01:02:18,332 --> 01:02:21,624
這是你們倆的合照  用我的第一台相機拍的
Here's one of you both, taken with my first camera.

546
01:02:26,957 --> 01:02:29,040
我真的愛上他了
I really was in love with him.

547
01:02:29,207 --> 01:02:32,957
- 但是機器人不會長大   - 你說得太對了
- But robots can't grow.   - You're absolutely right.

548
01:02:33,290 --> 01:02:35,249
我們是人造的  就像汽車一樣
We're manufactured. Like cars.

549
01:02:35,999 --> 01:02:38,249
- 或者洗衣機   - 或者飛機
- Or washing machines.   - Or planes.

550
01:02:38,957 --> 01:02:41,415
我不想再坐飛機了  我都八十歲了
I'm done flying. I'm 80.

551
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:44,624
- 八十一歲  爸爸   - 在你夢裏吧
- 81, Dad.   - In your dreams.

552
01:02:44,999 --> 01:02:47,249
你不需要飛到任何地方
You don't have to fly anywhere.

553
01:02:47,790 --> 01:02:49,624
八十一歲  八十一歲
81! 81!

554
01:02:49,957 --> 01:02:51,874
爺爺是個笨蛋
Grandpa's a dummy!

555
01:02:53,999 --> 01:02:56,957
我也很想見見你的母親
I would've loved to have met your mother, too.

556
01:02:58,499 --> 01:03:00,874
你還會夢到她嗎
Do you ever still dream about her?

557
01:03:02,207 --> 01:03:04,207
有時候會
Sometimes.

558
01:03:04,415 --> 01:03:06,665
但那是很久以前的事了
But it's so long ago.

559
01:03:21,207 --> 01:03:24,457
我們在...哥本哈根見面的時候
When we met... in Copenhagen,

560
01:03:25,290 --> 01:03:27,582
是什麼樣的情況
what was it like?

561
01:03:29,624 --> 01:03:32,832
在那個糟糕的會議酒店裏
It was at that awful convention hotel.

562
01:03:33,874 --> 01:03:37,665
你坐在講台上  我坐在觀眾席上
You sat on the podium, and I was in the audience.

563
01:03:37,832 --> 01:03:41,915
- 為同事做翻譯   - 在那每個人都會說英語
- Translating for colleagues.   - Everyone speaks English at those things.

564
01:03:42,832 --> 01:03:46,665
但不會說法語  也不會說韓語
But not the French and not the Koreans.

565
01:03:47,499 --> 01:03:50,165
你翻譯成了法語和韓語嗎
You translated into French and Korean?

566
01:03:57,332 --> 01:04:03,874
(公元前1600年至1100年是希臘青銅時代它由伯羅奔尼撤半島的邁錫尼城而得名)
你談到了邁錫尼文明和接下來的黑暗時代
You spoke about Mycenaean culture and the dark centuries that followed.

567
01:04:04,124 --> 01:04:06,665
邁錫尼文明嗎
The Mycenaean culture?

568
01:04:06,999 --> 01:04:11,332
你以為我是知道三千到七千年前事情的專家嗎
Do you think I'm an expert on everything between 3,000 and 7,000 years ago?

569
01:04:11,915 --> 01:04:15,040
(指在西歐歷史上  從西羅馬蒂國的滅亡到文藝復興開始
一段文化層次下降或者社會崩潰的時期)
不是  但絕對是黑暗時代的專家
No, but definitely the dark centuries.

570
01:04:21,249 --> 01:04:26,540
一個鉤鼻子和穿鉤針編織背心的女人採訪了你
And a woman with a striking hook nose and a crocheted vest interviewed you.

571
01:04:26,707 --> 01:04:29,374
什麼  那我會記得她的
What? I would remember her.

572
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:33,332
你不記得她是因為你只對我有感覺
You can't remember her because you only had eyes for me.

573
01:04:33,957 --> 01:04:36,040
哦  當然
Oh, of course.

574
01:04:36,207 --> 01:04:39,332
- 那為什麼呢    - 因為你在怎...
- Because?   - Because you thought...

575
01:04:39,582 --> 01:04:42,915
後面那個帥哥是誰
who the hell is that good-looking guy in the back?

576
01:04:47,957 --> 01:04:51,624
我們的照片是在那兒拍的  你床邊的那一張
And where was that picture of us taken? The one by your bed?

577
01:04:52,915 --> 01:04:57,832
那是我們第一次去...
That was from our first outing to...

578
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:29,300
湯姆
Tom

579
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:39,500
湯姆
Tom

580
01:07:09,207 --> 01:07:13,249
我只是站在那裏  他們並不覺得我很危險
I just stood there. They don't see me as a danger.

581
01:07:14,249 --> 01:07:16,332
我聞起來不像人類
I don't smell like a human.

582
01:07:18,165 --> 01:07:21,124
你聞起來像什麼
What do you smell like, for the deer?

583
01:07:21,749 --> 01:07:25,082
他們甚至不會注意到我  對他們來說我聞起來像是空氣
They don't even notice me. I smell like nothing to them.

584
01:07:27,290 --> 01:07:29,540
我想我們該走了
I think we'd better go.

585
01:07:30,207 --> 01:07:33,999
走到汽車那裏開車回城要花一段時間
It'll take a while to walk to the car and drive back to the city.

586
01:07:35,540 --> 01:07:38,290
我們赤腳跑過草地吧
Let's run across the meadow barefoot.

587
01:07:39,165 --> 01:07:41,332
- 不了   - 來吧
- No!   - Come on.

588
01:07:43,832 --> 01:07:45,790
讓我們體驗一下大自然吧
Let's experience nature!

589
01:07:46,832 --> 01:07:49,040
- 你等等我   - 快點
- Just you wait!   - Come on!

590
01:08:28,874 --> 01:08:30,499
你好
Hello.

591
01:08:31,165 --> 01:08:32,665
你是艾瑪
You're Alma.

592
01:08:33,665 --> 01:08:35,707
我看過照片  我是史黛菲
I've seen photos. I'm Steffi.

593
01:08:36,457 --> 01:08:38,915
- 謝謝你邀請我們   - 不用客氣
- Thanks for inviting us.   - Of course.

594
01:08:39,332 --> 01:08:41,665
- 這是湯姆   - 哦  好的
- This is Tom.   - Oh yes.

595
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:45,207
- 朱利安告訴過我   - 很高興見到你
- Julian told me.   - It's lovely to meet you.

596
01:08:45,415 --> 01:08:47,165
哇  很老派嘛
Wow, old school!

597
01:08:48,874 --> 01:08:51,832
艾瑪  你真的來了
Alma, you really came!

598
01:08:52,499 --> 01:08:54,207
- 我們真的來了   - 太好了
- We really came.   - Great.

599
01:08:54,749 --> 01:08:57,499
- 你們已經見過了嗎   - 是的
- You've met?   - Yes.

600
01:08:59,665 --> 01:09:03,082
- 你想喝點什麼  白的還是紅的   - 白的
- What would you like to drink? White, red?   - White.

601
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:06,832
- 莉賈娜  嗨   - 我馬上回來
- Regina, hi!   - I'll be right back.

602
01:09:09,249 --> 01:09:11,915
- 謝謝   - 你已經把照片掛上去了
- Thanks.   - You put the picture up already.

603
01:09:12,082 --> 01:09:15,832
照片掛好了  床也鋪好了  水也接好了
The picture's up, the bed's put together, the water is running.

604
01:09:15,999 --> 01:09:17,999
但還有很多都不能用
But nothing else works yet.

605
01:09:18,165 --> 01:09:20,999
有點奇怪  對吧  一如既往的奇怪
It's a little weird, right? As always.

606
01:09:21,999 --> 01:09:26,165
- 什麼   - 怦  新房子  新生活  新伴侶...
- What?   - Bam! New house, new life, new partner...

607
01:09:30,499 --> 01:09:31,707
怎麼...
What's... ?

608
01:09:34,957 --> 01:09:36,624
哦  上帝
Oh God!

609
01:09:42,124 --> 01:09:44,165
那是誰
Who's that?

610
01:09:44,749 --> 01:09:47,040
他是醫生嗎
Is he a doctor?

611
01:09:48,957 --> 01:09:52,415
是的  他可能也是個醫生
Yes, he's probably a doctor too.

612
01:09:54,124 --> 01:09:56,249
一座房子  一棵樹...
A house, a tree...

613
01:09:56,582 --> 01:09:59,540
希望一份穩定的工作在路上了
and hopefully a steady job on the way!

614
01:10:03,499 --> 01:10:05,207
謝謝
Thanks.

615
01:10:08,207 --> 01:10:10,040
- 艾瑪   - 羅傑
- Alma!   - Roger!

616
01:10:13,457 --> 01:10:17,249
- 他們都在外面   - 布宜諾斯艾利斯的事我很抱歉
- They're all outside.   - I'm so sorry about Buenos Aires.

617
01:10:17,582 --> 01:10:19,207
太令人沮喪了
How frustrating!

618
01:10:20,124 --> 01:10:21,624
湯姆  這是羅傑
Tom, this is Roger.

619
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:25,499
嗨  也許你還可以使用一部分
Hi. Maybe you can still use some elements

620
01:10:25,665 --> 01:10:27,624
在另一項研究中...
in another study...

621
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:33,290
那是...
Is that...

622
01:10:35,124 --> 01:10:36,249
太瘋狂了
Crazy.

623
01:10:42,624 --> 01:10:44,499
難以置信
Incredible!

624
01:10:45,874 --> 01:10:47,665
可以碰嗎
May I?

625
01:10:49,957 --> 01:10:51,624
難以置信
Unbelievable.

626
01:11:06,999 --> 01:11:08,582
- 感覺像是...   - 羅傑
- That feels so...   - Roger!

627
01:11:08,915 --> 01:11:09,999
怎麼了
Yes?

628
01:11:10,332 --> 01:11:14,165
- 你知道你在侵犯隱私吧   - 有嗎  只是...
- You do realize you're being invasive?   - Why? It's just....

629
01:11:14,332 --> 01:11:19,207
如果有人碰了你的臉和頭髮  你會有什麼感覺
How would you feel if someone just touched your face and your hair?

630
01:11:20,415 --> 01:11:24,582
我遇到過不上一百次了  但這次不一樣
Well, it's happened to me 100 times, but this is different.

631
01:11:24,957 --> 01:11:27,207
- 怎麼不一樣   - 嗯  這個...
- How?   - Yeah, well...

632
01:11:27,624 --> 01:11:31,540
- 有什麼不同嗎   - 他為什麼不反對  他不能說話嗎
- How is it different?   - Why doesn't he object? Can't he talk?

633
01:11:31,957 --> 01:11:35,332
湯姆也會說話  湯姆是個友好的機器人
Tom can also talk. Tom is a friendly robot.

634
01:11:36,582 --> 01:11:39,249
好吧  現在你完全可以看出差別了
Well, now you can totally tell.

635
01:11:39,915 --> 01:11:41,124
不好意思
Pardon me.

636
01:11:41,457 --> 01:11:44,207
沒問題  我們可以談談
No problem. We'll chat a little.

637
01:11:44,374 --> 01:11:47,040
- 他在耍我嗎   - 是的
- Was he messing with me?   - Yes.

638
01:11:47,540 --> 01:11:49,707
對不起  我情不自禁
Sorry, I couldn't help myself.

639
01:11:54,915 --> 01:11:58,040
- 我能和你談談嗎   - 可以
- Can I talk with you for a second?   - Of course.

640
01:12:00,790 --> 01:12:01,790
哦
Oh.

641
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:07,290
好吧  跟我來
Yes, come with me.

642
01:12:15,707 --> 01:12:18,457
對不起  這是唯一空著的房間
Sorry, it's the only room that's empty.

643
01:12:19,665 --> 01:12:21,624
告訴我...
Tell me...

644
01:12:22,749 --> 01:12:24,874
史黛菲是懷了孕嗎
Is Steffi pregnant?

645
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:27,749
媽的
Oh fuck.

646
01:12:28,874 --> 01:12:31,415
我本來想告訴你的  但是...
I was going to tell you anyway, but...

647
01:12:31,832 --> 01:12:36,499
- 很抱歉讓你這樣發現   - 沒關係  現在我知道了
- I'm sorry you found out like this.   - It's fine. Now I know.

648
01:12:36,665 --> 01:12:40,457
她還沒有懷孕三個月  所以你知道...
She's not even three months pregnant yet, so you know...

649
01:12:40,624 --> 01:12:44,624
- 我們還不清楚狀況   - 好的  我知道了
- We're not in the clear yet.   - Yes, I know.

650
01:12:47,332 --> 01:12:49,207
朱利安
Julian?

651
01:12:49,582 --> 01:12:53,957
- 對不起  冰箱裏沒有杜松子酒   - 在冰櫃裏
- Sorry, there's no gin in the fridge.   - In the freezer.

652
01:12:54,415 --> 01:12:57,040
當然  我真蠢
Of course. How dumb of me.

653
01:13:17,124 --> 01:13:19,207
喂  莉賈娜
Regina. Hello.

654
01:13:20,707 --> 01:13:22,790
嗯  一切都很好
Yes, everything's fine.

655
01:13:23,999 --> 01:13:26,290
沒有  只是今天太累了
No, it's just been a long day.

656
01:13:27,707 --> 01:13:29,624
我會的
Yup, I will.

657
01:13:33,374 --> 01:13:36,707
莉賈娜向你問好  她覺得你很棒
Regina says hi. She thinks you're great.

658
01:13:37,915 --> 01:13:40,290
每個人都認為你很棒
Everyone thinks you're great.

659
01:13:42,249 --> 01:13:44,457
除了你
Everyone but you.

660
01:13:51,749 --> 01:13:54,415
我十四歲的時候參加了一個派對
When I was 14, I went to a party.

661
01:13:55,374 --> 01:13:58,249
晚上我一個人坐在陽台上
I sat alone at night on the terrace.

662
01:13:58,415 --> 01:14:01,290
我的同學們在地窖裏跳舞
My classmates were dancing in the cellar.

663
01:14:01,707 --> 01:14:04,124
我看著外面的聯排別墅
I looked out at the townhouses

664
01:14:04,290 --> 01:14:07,540
突然我意識到上帝並不存在
and suddenly I knew that God didn't exist.

665
01:14:07,707 --> 01:14:10,749
然後我成了一個無神論者
And I became an atheist.

666
01:14:10,915 --> 01:14:13,749
當時我對自己發誓
I made a vow to myself back then:

667
01:14:14,332 --> 01:14:18,999
如果我在一架著火的飛機上  我不會祈禱
If I'm in an airplane that's on fire, I'm not going to pray.

668
01:14:19,915 --> 01:14:22,957
我不會向上帝尋求幫助  那怕只是出於恐懼
I won't ask the Lord for help, just out of fear.

669
01:14:23,457 --> 01:14:25,665
因為我不相信上帝
Because I don't believe in God.

670
01:14:25,832 --> 01:14:27,707
你明白嗎
Do you understand?

671
01:14:27,874 --> 01:14:29,290
明白
Yes.

672
01:14:29,457 --> 01:14:30,874
真的嗎
Really?

673
01:14:31,790 --> 01:14:35,499
你不會允許自己因為絕望
You won't allow yourself to become close to a machine

674
01:14:35,665 --> 01:14:39,040
和渴望與人接觸而與機器親近
out of desperation and longing for human contact.

675
01:14:40,624 --> 01:14:42,957
我們之間有鴻溝
There's a gulf between us.

676
01:14:43,124 --> 01:14:45,499
我們可以假裝它不存在
We can pretend it doesn't exist,

677
01:14:45,665 --> 01:14:49,749
假裝幻覺只是現實的另一種形式
pretend the illusion is just another form of reality,

678
01:14:49,999 --> 01:14:55,290
但是有些事情凸顯了這個鴻溝是多麼的深  多麼的不可逾越
but certain things highlight just how deep and insurmountable that gulf is.

679
01:14:56,290 --> 01:14:59,082
- 什麼事   - 你不能理解的事
- What things?   - Things you can't understand.

680
01:15:00,290 --> 01:15:04,040
一些你一想到就讓你傷心的事情
Things that make you sad the second you think of them,

681
01:15:04,374 --> 01:15:06,332
即使你不想去想
even if you don't want to.

682
01:15:06,499 --> 01:15:09,707
一些你渴望或錯過的東西
Things you long for or missed out on

683
01:15:09,874 --> 01:15:11,749
可是再也不會回來了
that will never return.

684
01:15:12,290 --> 01:15:14,832
你能給我看看那些東西嗎
Can you show me these things?

685
01:15:15,749 --> 01:15:17,665
給你看嗎
Show you?

686
01:15:17,832 --> 01:15:20,124
好的  我可以
Yes, I can.

687
01:15:21,082 --> 01:15:22,915
在那邊
Over there.

688
01:15:30,915 --> 01:15:31,957
走遠了
Cold.

689
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:39,707
接近了
Warmer.

690
01:15:42,290 --> 01:15:44,082
非常接近了
Very warm.

691
01:15:49,290 --> 01:15:51,499
我能打開嗎
Can I open it?

692
01:16:02,874 --> 01:16:05,540
這是胚胎的超聲波圖像
It's the ultrasound image of an embryo.

693
01:16:05,999 --> 01:16:08,165
「艾瑪.費爾瑟  十一週」
"Alma Felser, 11 weeks."

694
01:16:08,457 --> 01:16:10,332
為什麼會覺得我不能理解昵
Why wouldn't I understand?

695
01:16:18,790 --> 01:16:20,999
你失去了一個孩子
You've lost a child.

696
01:16:21,249 --> 01:16:24,957
在你這個年齡  你可能有機率不會再有第二個孩子了
At your age, you probably won't be able to have another one.

697
01:16:33,665 --> 01:16:37,790
你難過是因為你想體驗這種感覺
You're sad because you would've liked to have experienced that.

698
01:16:38,457 --> 01:16:40,332
你覺得被拋棄了
You feel cast aside

699
01:16:40,499 --> 01:16:44,207
因為朱利安又要生孩子了  而他會忘記這個孩子
because Julian is having another baby and will forget this one.

700
01:16:45,249 --> 01:16:49,915
也許你會想起你的父親  你可能會像他一樣孤獨終老
Maybe you think of your father, that you might end up as lonely as he is

701
01:16:50,665 --> 01:16:54,082
你甚至不會有孩子來照顧你
and you won't even have children to take care of you.

702
01:16:54,790 --> 01:16:57,957
我能理解  這很容易理解
I can understand that. It's very easy to understand.

703
01:16:59,957 --> 01:17:02,707
你說這話的時候  聽起來像是很無關緊要
It sounds banal when you say it.

704
01:17:03,707 --> 01:17:06,499
無關緊要  自我放縱  可悲
Banal and self-indulgent and pathetic.

705
01:17:06,665 --> 01:17:08,374
這很可悲
It is pathetic.

706
01:17:08,707 --> 01:17:11,415
你的痛苦是可悲的  因為它是相對的
Your pain is pathetic because it's relative.

707
01:17:11,582 --> 01:17:14,082
但也不可悲
But it's also not pathetic,

708
01:17:14,707 --> 01:17:17,999
因為它是你的一部分  這就是我喜歡它的原因
because it's part of you, and that's why I love it.

709
01:20:45,915 --> 01:20:49,540
- 我一直在找你   - 你怎樣進來的
- I was looking for you.   - How did you get in here?

710
01:20:50,332 --> 01:20:53,749
我是一台電腦  門鎖定系軌也是一台電胭
I'm a computer. The lock system is a computer.

711
01:20:55,290 --> 01:20:58,040
我們偶爾會互相幫助
We help each other out once in a while.

712
01:20:58,790 --> 01:21:01,165
- 真的嗎   - 不是
- Really?   - No.

713
01:21:01,624 --> 01:21:04,290
我拿了你的備用卡
I took your spare card.

714
01:21:04,957 --> 01:21:07,582
因為我知道我會在這裏找到你
Because I knew I'd find you here.

715
01:21:07,957 --> 01:21:09,915
是這樣嗎
Is that so?

716
01:21:57,207 --> 01:22:01,624
如果人們乘坐的飛機即將墜毀  大多數人都會祈禱
Most people would pray if their airplane was about to crash.

717
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:05,124
這是人之常情
It's human to do that.

718
01:22:54,374 --> 01:22:56,540
如果你願意  可以想像是在和一個人類
Think of a human if you'd like.

719
01:22:57,915 --> 01:23:00,499
你可以想像是在和一個機器人
And you can think of a robot.

720
01:24:05,624 --> 01:24:08,582
高潮是什樣感覺
What does it feel like to have an orgasm?

721
01:24:13,540 --> 01:24:17,415
就像...就像是溶解一樣
It's... It's like dissolving.

722
01:24:18,457 --> 01:24:20,832
你溶解  然後...
You dissolve and...

723
01:24:21,915 --> 01:24:24,707
成為某個更大事件的一部分
you're part of something bigger.

724
01:25:55,665 --> 01:25:58,290
哦  這咖啡聞起來真香
Oh, does that coffee smell good!

725
01:26:00,165 --> 01:26:02,124
我打呼嚕了嗎
Was I snoring?

726
01:26:03,374 --> 01:26:06,749
我覺得我打呼嚕了  是不是很奇怪
I think I was snoring. Isn't that strange?

727
01:26:07,165 --> 01:26:09,374
這樣不行
This isn't working.

728
01:26:09,999 --> 01:26:12,582
這是錯的  我不能這麼做
It's all wrong. I can't do this.

729
01:26:13,374 --> 01:26:14,540
做什麼
Do what?

730
01:26:20,165 --> 01:26:24,165
我替你拉起被子  即使你不會感冒
I pull the covers up for you, even though you can't get cold.

731
01:26:24,415 --> 01:26:27,749
即使你不睡覺  我也攝手攝腳地走出房間
I tiptoe out of the room, even though you don't sleep.

732
01:26:28,915 --> 01:26:32,040
我試著給你做一個完美的煮雞蛋
I try to make you a perfect boiled egg,

733
01:26:32,374 --> 01:26:36,540
即使你不在乎它是硬的還是軟的
even though you could care less if it's hard or soft boiled.

734
01:26:37,165 --> 01:26:39,374
你甚至不用吃東西
You don't even have to eat.

735
01:26:39,624 --> 01:26:41,707
我正在演一齣戲
I'm acting in a play.

736
01:26:42,749 --> 01:26:44,707
但是沒有觀眾
But there's no audience.

737
01:26:44,874 --> 01:26:47,249
所有的座位都是空的
All the seats are empty.

738
01:26:47,540 --> 01:26:49,457
我根本不是為你演戲
I'm not even acting for you.

739
01:26:49,790 --> 01:26:52,582
我很孤獨  我是在為我自己演戲
I'm all alone. I'm only acting for myself.

740
01:26:53,749 --> 01:26:57,332
即使是現在  我也只是在自言自語
Even right now, I'm only talking to myself.

741
01:26:57,582 --> 01:26:59,790
這並不是在對話
It's not a dialogue.

742
01:27:00,665 --> 01:27:04,707
我正在變成一個怪人  一個瘋子
I'm turning into a lunatic, a nutcase,

743
01:27:05,249 --> 01:27:08,249
...一個咧著嘴笑的白癡  這必須停止
...a grinning idiot and this has to stop.

744
01:27:09,165 --> 01:27:11,290
你為什麼哭
Why are you crying?

745
01:27:11,957 --> 01:27:14,707
我哭是因為昨晚太...
I'm crying because last night was so...

746
01:27:15,665 --> 01:27:17,790
美好了  而且...
beautiful, and...

747
01:27:18,582 --> 01:27:21,415
人類不是說過愛是沒有界限的嗎
Don't humans say: "love knows no bounds"?

748
01:27:22,915 --> 01:27:25,165
那麼一直都是謊言
That's always been a lie.

749
01:27:27,665 --> 01:27:30,040
但是我能去那兒呢
But where am I to go?

750
01:27:30,374 --> 01:27:34,082
- 我要提前結束實驗   - 好的  但是...
- I'm ending the experiment early.   - Yes, but...

751
01:27:36,665 --> 01:27:38,874
我該去那兒
Where am I to go?

752
01:27:39,540 --> 01:27:42,415
我怎麼知道  也許去工廠
How should I know? The factory, maybe?

753
01:28:09,665 --> 01:28:13,165
你可以把鑰匙留一段時間  以後再給我
You can keep the keys for a while. Give them to me later.

754
01:28:13,499 --> 01:28:16,332
我想我不需要你的鑰匙了
I doubt I'll be needing your keys.

755
01:28:16,790 --> 01:28:19,582
- 沒事的  但也許...   - 艾瑪...
- Yeah, but maybe...   - Alma...

756
01:28:21,624 --> 01:28:23,790
我將不再存在了
I won't exist anymore.

757
01:28:24,374 --> 01:28:25,999
我要回去了
I'm going back.

758
01:28:26,415 --> 01:28:29,249
- 然後我就會被抹去   - 哦  天啊
- Then I'll be erased.   - Oh God!

759
01:28:29,832 --> 01:28:33,832
- 聽起來像是...   - 這就是不活著的好處
- That sounds like...   - That's an advantage of not being alive.

760
01:28:33,999 --> 01:28:36,457
你也不會死
You can't die either.

761
01:28:37,457 --> 01:28:39,832
別擔心我
Don't worry about me.

762
01:28:49,790 --> 01:28:51,249
湯姆
Tom!

763
01:28:52,957 --> 01:28:55,249
我不能把你送走
I can't send you away.

764
01:28:55,415 --> 01:28:57,290
你必須為我這樣做
You have to do it for me.

765
01:28:57,707 --> 01:29:00,540
你的演算法必須為我做到這一點
Your algorithm has to do it for me.

766
01:29:01,457 --> 01:29:03,999
我不會讓你走的
I wouldn't let you go.

767
01:31:32,499 --> 01:31:34,832
你他媽的是白癡嗎
Are you a fucking idiot?

768
01:31:40,957 --> 01:31:42,707
別盯著我  你這個婊子
Stop staring, you bitch!

769
01:32:07,207 --> 01:32:08,540
怎麼回事
What?

770
01:32:27,249 --> 01:32:29,957
爸爸  怎麼了
Dad! What happened?

771
01:32:30,249 --> 01:32:31,832
你在幹什麼
What are you doing?

772
01:32:31,999 --> 01:32:34,457
我在找遙控器
I'm looking for the remote control.

773
01:32:34,624 --> 01:32:36,790
就在這附近
It's around here somewhere.

774
01:32:37,332 --> 01:32:39,999
- 你不能找找嗎   - 你怎麼流血了
- Can't you look for it?   - Why are you bleeding?

775
01:32:40,624 --> 01:32:44,540
- 來吧  爸爸  我帶你回家   - 但遙控器
- Come on, Dad. I'll bring you home.   - But the remote!

776
01:32:44,707 --> 01:32:47,040
它一定在這裏的某個地方
It has to be here somewhere.

777
01:32:47,540 --> 01:32:50,374
我敢肯定在家裏  我們回家再找找吧
I'm sure it's at home. We'll look for it at home.

778
01:32:50,540 --> 01:32:55,332
它一定在這裏的什麼地方  也許掉了在什麼東西後面
It must be here somewhere. Maybe it fell behind something.

779
01:32:56,957 --> 01:32:59,165
目前就這些
That's it for now.

780
01:33:05,415 --> 01:33:07,415
誰會這樣做
Who would do this?

781
01:33:07,582 --> 01:33:10,874
毆打一個穿著睡衣的困惑老人
Beat up a confused, old man in his nightshirt.

782
01:33:11,374 --> 01:33:12,832
業餘的
Amateurs.

783
01:33:12,999 --> 01:33:15,999
絕對是業餘的  像是癮君子  絕望的人
Definitely amateurs: junkies, desperate people.

784
01:33:16,499 --> 01:33:18,957
- 保重   - 這裏經常發生這種事
- Take care.   - Happens a lot around here.

785
01:33:19,124 --> 01:33:21,707
過去六個月有十二個這樣的案子了
12 cases in the last six months.

786
01:33:21,874 --> 01:33:24,957
專業的會發現這裏沒什麼值錢的東西
A pro would see there's nothing valuable here.

787
01:33:26,165 --> 01:33:29,207
什麼沒有值錢的東西  這裏的東西都很值錢
Nothing valuable? Everything here is valuable.

788
01:33:29,749 --> 01:33:33,415
你知道這些照片有多值錢嗎
Do you have any idea how valuable this all is? Every photo?

789
01:33:33,874 --> 01:33:35,665
這些都很值錢
It's all valuable!

790
01:33:35,832 --> 01:33:38,874
- 你怎麼能這樣說   - 對不起  我...
- How could you say that?   - I'm sorry, I...

791
01:33:39,374 --> 01:33:43,707
我的意思是  從一個小偷的角度來看  價值總是相對的
I meant, from a thief's perspective. Value is always relative.

792
01:33:45,082 --> 01:33:46,082
哦  天啊
Oh God!

793
01:34:02,582 --> 01:34:04,582
大家好
Hello.

794
01:34:30,332 --> 01:34:32,415
- 早上好   - 早上好
- Good morning.   - Good morning.

795
01:34:33,915 --> 01:34:35,665
很高興見到你們
It's nice to see you all.

796
01:34:38,790 --> 01:34:41,165
你需要什麼嗎
Hey, you need anything?

797
01:34:58,290 --> 01:34:59,540
你好
Hello?

798
01:34:59,874 --> 01:35:01,290
打擾一下
Excuse us.

799
01:35:03,790 --> 01:35:06,582
請允許我介紹一下  這位是克洛伊
May I introduce you? This is Chloé.

800
01:35:07,082 --> 01:35:08,874
你好  我是克洛伊
Hello, I'm Chloé.

801
01:35:11,707 --> 01:35:14,082
我們在舞廳的活動見過
From the event in the ballroom?

802
01:35:14,499 --> 01:35:17,290
我也是個專家  但是在司法系統
I'm an expert too, but in the judicial system.

803
01:35:17,540 --> 01:35:18,457
斯圖博士
Dr Stuber.

804
01:35:21,582 --> 01:35:22,915
克洛伊是...
And Chloé is...?

805
01:35:23,457 --> 01:35:25,499
她是我的唯一
She's my one and only.

806
01:35:25,749 --> 01:35:28,124
你不能一直這麼說
You mustn't keep saying that.

807
01:35:33,332 --> 01:35:36,457
- 進展如何   - 進展如何
- And how is it going?   - How is it going?

808
01:35:36,957 --> 01:35:39,582
我不知道應該怎樣形容
I don't know how to describe it.

809
01:35:39,915 --> 01:35:43,040
我從來不知道能夠這麼快樂
I had no idea it was possible to be this happy.

810
01:35:44,124 --> 01:35:47,874
當然  我是個老傢伙  我的身體...  畢竟我已經六十二歲了
I'm an old fart, of course. My body... I'm 62 after all.

811
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:51,374
但現在我和克洛伊在一起了
But now that I'm with Chloé,

812
01:35:51,665 --> 01:35:55,165
我知道我以前是多麼不開心
I see just how unhappy I was before.

813
01:35:55,624 --> 01:35:57,665
沒人要我
Nobody wanted me.

814
01:35:57,999 --> 01:36:01,665
我身上有種特質  讓人們總是躲著我
There's something about me. People run from me.

815
01:36:01,832 --> 01:36:05,707
我不知道為什麼  也許是因為外激素或者我的外表
I don't know why. Maybe it's pheromones or my appearance.

816
01:36:06,249 --> 01:36:08,832
我整個人生都是這樣
It was like that my entire life.

817
01:36:08,999 --> 01:36:12,665
我已經習慣了  也本會這樣一直下去  但是...
I'd gotten used to it. That's just the way it was, but...

818
01:36:13,165 --> 01:36:17,665
我現在和克洛依在一起... 她比任何人都要對我好
now with Chloé... She's kinder to me than any human ever was.

819
01:36:19,290 --> 01:36:22,249
你應該得到善待
You deserve to be treated kindly.

820
01:36:24,582 --> 01:36:29,415
我已經在談判  看在什麼條件下我可以留下她
I'm already in negotiations to see under what conditions I could keep her.

821
01:36:30,665 --> 01:36:33,165
你呢  你和...
And you? How are you and...

822
01:36:34,832 --> 01:36:36,457
你和...
You and...

823
01:36:44,874 --> 01:36:46,540
親愛的羅傑
Dear Roger,

824
01:36:46,707 --> 01:36:49,249
這是我答應過的評估報告
here is my evaluation as promised.

825
01:36:49,415 --> 01:36:51,790
祝你一切順利  艾瑪
All the best, Alma.

826
01:36:54,624 --> 01:36:58,915
人類歷史充滿了所謂的進步
Human history is full of supposed improvements

827
01:36:59,249 --> 01:37:05,332
其可怕的後果在幾十年甚至幾個世紀後才變得清晰
whose dire consequences only become clear decades or even centuries later.

828
01:37:06,749 --> 01:37:11,957
在我與一個名為湯姆的類人機器人的相處之後
After my experience with a humanoid robot named Tom,

829
01:37:12,207 --> 01:37:14,582
我可以肯定地說
I can say with certainty

830
01:37:14,749 --> 01:37:18,665
一個被設計來取代丈夫或妻子的機器人
that a robot designed to replace a husband or wife

831
01:37:19,082 --> 01:37:22,249
就是這樣一個所謂的改進
is one such supposed improvement.

832
01:37:24,290 --> 01:37:29,332
毫無疑問  一個類人機器人是根據個人喜好定製的
There's no doubt that a humanoid robot tailored to individual preferences

833
01:37:29,624 --> 01:37:32,165
不僅可以取代伴侶
can not only replace a partner,

834
01:37:32,332 --> 01:37:35,207
甚至可以看起來是更好的伴侶
but can even seem to be the better partner.

835
01:37:41,415 --> 01:37:43,749
他們可以滿足我們的渴望
They fulfill our longings,

836
01:37:43,915 --> 01:37:45,999
滿足我們的慾望
satisfy our desires

837
01:37:46,165 --> 01:37:49,249
消除我們的孤獨感
and eliminate our feeling of being alone.

838
01:37:54,290 --> 01:37:56,582
他們讓我們快樂
They make us happy.

839
01:37:56,749 --> 01:38:00,290
快樂又有什麼錯呢
And what could be wrong with being happy?

840
01:38:08,999 --> 01:38:12,165
- 早上好   - 啊  什麼事
- Good morning.   - Ah. Yes?

841
01:38:12,707 --> 01:38:16,249
雖然我不可能更新我的操作系統
Although it's not possible to update my operating system,

842
01:38:16,415 --> 01:38:19,457
我的通訊區域已經被重組了
my communication sector has been restructured.

843
01:38:19,999 --> 01:38:21,082
什麼
What?

844
01:38:21,415 --> 01:38:24,499
我相信今天的會議一定會很成功
I'm sure we'll have a successful session today.

845
01:38:25,707 --> 01:38:29,207
- 湯姆不在這裏   - 他什麼時候回來
- Tom is not here.   - When will he be back?

846
01:38:29,624 --> 01:38:31,499
他不在你公司嗎
He's not at your company?

847
01:38:32,290 --> 01:38:33,915
他為什麼會在那裏
Why would he be?

848
01:38:40,374 --> 01:38:42,749
但是人類真的打算
But are humans really intended

849
01:38:42,915 --> 01:38:46,915
只需按下按鈕就能夠滿足他們所有的需求嗎
to have all their needs met at the push of a button?

850
01:38:48,082 --> 01:38:50,957
難道不是因為我們未滿足的渴望
Is it not our unfulfilled longing,

851
01:38:51,207 --> 01:38:54,665
我們的想像力和對幸福無止境的追求
our imagination and our unending pursuit of happiness

852
01:38:54,832 --> 01:38:57,790
才是我們人性的泉源嗎
that are the sources of our humanity?

853
01:39:00,415 --> 01:39:06,040
如果我們允許類人機器作為配偶  我們將創造一個由癮君子組成的社會
If we allow humanoids as spouses, we will create a society of addicts,

854
01:39:06,540 --> 01:39:10,707
因為他們的需求會被永久地滿足  並從持續不斷的個人承認中得到滿足
gorged and weary from having their needs permanently met

855
01:39:10,874 --> 01:39:14,665
他們會變得貪婪和疲憊
and from a constant flow of personal acknowledgement.

856
01:39:16,332 --> 01:39:21,374
我們會有什麼動力去面對傳統的個人
What impetus would we have to confront conventional individuals,

857
01:39:21,540 --> 01:39:26,957
去挑戰自我  去忍受衝突  去改變昵
to challenge ourselves, to endure conflicts, to change?

858
01:39:28,457 --> 01:39:32,540
可以預見的是  任何長期與類人機器生活在一起的人
It's to be expected that anyone who lives with a humanoid long term

859
01:39:33,207 --> 01:39:37,207
都會變得無法維持正常的人類接觸
will become incapable of sustaining normal human contact.

860
01:39:38,707 --> 01:39:41,457
所以我強烈反對
I strongly advise against

861
01:39:41,999 --> 01:39:45,124
批准類人機器作為生活伴侶
authorizing humanoids as life partners.

862
01:41:22,457 --> 01:41:25,832
- 你在這裏坐了多久   - 沒多久
- How long have you been sitting here?   - Not that long.

863
01:41:26,290 --> 01:41:28,207
三天
Three days.

864
01:41:28,915 --> 01:41:31,540
但我步行來這裏花了不少時間
I came here on foot. It took a while.

865
01:41:34,249 --> 01:41:36,374
你打算在這裏等多久
How long were you going to wait?

866
01:41:38,082 --> 01:41:40,165
直到你到來
Until you came.

867
01:41:47,749 --> 01:41:50,165
我希望我從來沒有遇見過你
I wish I'd never met you.

868
01:41:52,165 --> 01:41:55,749
沒有你的生活就是現在這樣沒有你的生活
Life without you is now just a life without you.

869
01:41:57,207 --> 01:42:00,665
這不就是你所說的愛的定義嗎
Isn't that the definition of what you call love?

870
01:42:07,124 --> 01:42:10,457
我總是躺在乒乓球桌的這一邊
I'd always lie on this side of the ping-pong table.

871
01:42:11,165 --> 01:42:15,707
我不知道為什麼  但是我比較喜歡這一面
I don't know why, but I liked this side much better than the other one.

872
01:42:18,749 --> 01:42:22,374
托馬斯總是蹦蹦跳跳地穿過沙丘
Thomas was always jumping up and running through the dunes.

873
01:42:22,540 --> 01:42:25,707
有時你能聽到他的聲音  有時卻聽不到
Sometimes you'd hear him, sometimes you wouldn't.

874
01:42:27,124 --> 01:42:29,915
我不記得柯拉去了那裏
I don't remember where Cora was.

875
01:42:31,124 --> 01:42:33,082
我非常愛他
I was so in love with him.

876
01:42:33,249 --> 01:42:35,374
愛到我幾乎無法承受
I could hardly bare it.

877
01:42:37,707 --> 01:42:41,040
當他在沙丘上追趕鵪鶉
While he was chasing partridges through the dunes,

878
01:42:41,207 --> 01:42:44,832
或埋石頭  或尋找琥珀
or burying stones, or hunting for amber,

879
01:42:45,249 --> 01:42:48,415
或丹麥男孩在沙丘上做的任何事情時
or whatever it is Danish boys do in dunes,

880
01:42:49,415 --> 01:42:52,540
我總是閉著睛躺在這裏
I'd always lie here with my eyes closed,

881
01:42:52,915 --> 01:42:55,582
希望他能吻我
hoping that he'd kiss me.

882
01:42:56,999 --> 01:43:00,249
有幾次我非常肯定
And a few times I was absolutely positive

883
01:43:00,415 --> 01:43:03,249
他的臉正對著我
that his face was right over mine.

884
01:43:03,790 --> 01:43:06,707
我能在我的嘴唇上感覺到他的呼吸
I could feel his breath on my lips.

885
01:43:08,915 --> 01:43:11,457
但當我睜開眼睛
But when I opened my eyes,

886
01:43:11,624 --> 01:43:14,082
我獨自一人
I was alone,

887
01:43:14,290 --> 01:43:16,790
而托馬斯卻不見蹤影
and Thomas was nowhere in sight.
