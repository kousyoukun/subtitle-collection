00:00:24,571 --> 00:00:26,766
Julia...

3
00:00:26,931 --> 00:00:30,719
Look at the camera.
-Way. I have my hair washed.

4
00:00:30,891 --> 00:00:32,768
Say 'congratulations'.

00:00:32,931 --> 00:00:38,289
Dad Are you his camera?
-It's for grandma. Say 'congratulations'.

6
00:00:38,451 --> 00:00:42,808
Day, Mom.
Congratulations on your birthday. I love you.

7
00:00:42,971 --> 00:00:45,883
And now on the side.

8
00:00:47,051 --> 00:00:48,928
Joanne...

9
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:52,401
You should congratulate grandma.
-I'm busy.

10
00:00:52,571 --> 00:00:54,926
Congratulations, Grandma. Satisfied?

11
00:00:55,091 --> 00:00:58,970
Andrew, we must go now.

12
00:00:59,131 --> 00:01:03,090
There you are. What are you doing?
-It's for grandma.

13
00:01:03,251 --> 00:01:06,800
What do you mean?
-She's birthday?

14
00:01:07,971 --> 00:01:09,643
Hello, Olivia.

15
00:01:11,611 --> 00:01:14,284
We're about to sail. Nice to see you.

16
00:01:14,451 --> 00:01:18,285
Congratulations. Another year there.

17
00:01:18,451 --> 00:01:20,487
That's enough.

18
00:01:21,371 --> 00:01:24,169
Come on, Andrew.
-Congratulations, Grandma.

19
00:01:24,331 --> 00:01:26,970
Give it to mama.
-Where's his jacket?

20
00:02:02,411 --> 00:02:05,801
The transcripts.
He ​​really said anything.

21
00:02:05,971 --> 00:02:09,600
Gail, you can delete the journey from Calcutta
?

22
00:02:09,771 --> 00:02:13,764
It must be a holiday look.
-I'm trying.

23
00:02:13,931 --> 00:02:16,729
What would a holiday be like?
-Lndia.

24
00:02:16,891 --> 00:02:21,760
Selective with the truth.
-If they do not see. But I must.

25
00:02:21,931 --> 00:02:26,846
We received this morning a complaint from the widow of a certain someone.

26
00:02:27,011 --> 00:02:29,320
A total of seven zeros.

27
00:02:29,491 --> 00:02:32,608
I called him a liar.
And he is.

28
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:37,122
Is that it?

29
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:43,000
What beautiful.
What a fabulous zebra.

30
00:02:43,171 --> 00:02:49,167
For Jack, Julia, Joanne and Andrew,
gave my life a new perspective.

31
00:02:49,331 --> 00:02:51,242
We have a deal.

32
00:02:51,411 --> 00:02:53,971
I was certainly not forgotten.

33
00:03:26,371 --> 00:03:29,681
You have your whole life ugly.
-I hate you.

34
00:03:30,411 --> 00:03:32,925
Look what I got.
-The newspaper.

35
00:03:33,091 --> 00:03:35,047
No, tickets.

36
00:03:35,211 --> 00:03:37,122
Morning, Mom.

37
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:40,124
Mom, Joanne wanted my...
-Dad has something.

38
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,202
Quiet, you.

39
00:03:43,131 --> 00:03:45,042
Morning, honey.

40
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:51,925
I got here five return tickets
for lndia in my hand.

41
00:03:52,091 --> 00:03:54,730
're Kidding.
-With Indians?

42
00:03:54,891 --> 00:03:56,722
Lndia, sucker.

43
00:03:56,891 --> 00:03:59,644
And then Corfu?

44
00:03:59,811 --> 00:04:03,963
A week on the beach in Goa.
Delhi, the Taj Mahal and Agra.

45
00:04:04,131 --> 00:04:09,080
And then to Bombay and back in time
for Chelsea against Spurs.

46
00:04:11,171 --> 00:04:13,890
I'm going back to bed.
-Pick them at once.

47
00:04:14,051 --> 00:04:16,929
Honey, forget lunch, do you?

48
00:04:23,211 --> 00:04:29,161
You have canceled our trip, huh?
-Lndia is truly a unique opportunity.

49
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:35,930
The Germans want to build a dam in Madhya Pradesh
.

50
00:04:36,091 --> 00:04:39,606
You did Europe do?
-It's just an article.

51
00:04:39,771 --> 00:04:43,650
And some interviews.
-And the tea with the Prime Minister.

52
00:04:43,811 --> 00:04:48,931
If you go to lndia,
need you to tea with the Prime Minister.

53
00:04:50,171 --> 00:04:53,402
Nobody wants more time to spend in the office.

54
00:04:53,571 --> 00:04:55,209
We go to lndia.

55
00:04:55,371 --> 00:04:58,647
You could go sailing with Andy.
And Joanne...

56
00:04:58,811 --> 00:05:03,123
The kids love it.
-Because you take them.

57
00:05:07,371 --> 00:05:10,090
Before you know it, they're great.

58
00:05:19,451 --> 00:05:21,601
Bit tumble?

59
00:05:26,251 --> 00:05:28,321
Here you mean nothing.

60
00:05:37,251 --> 00:05:39,401
Want something to eat?

61
00:05:52,171 --> 00:05:56,323
It is amazing,
though this is our last safe meal.

62
00:05:56,491 --> 00:06:02,760
I have unfortunately bad news. There is a small problem
and we must flee.

63
00:06:02,931 --> 00:06:07,686
There is no danger,
but we must follow the rules...

64
00:06:07,851 --> 00:06:14,290
And therefore we land in Limassol,
where the repair is performed.

65
00:06:14,451 --> 00:06:16,760
You belt.

66
00:06:20,851 --> 00:06:23,524
Why did you do that?
-Belt fixed.

67
00:06:39,571 --> 00:06:41,766
Can not we stay?

68
00:06:41,931 --> 00:06:45,048
Then we rent a fishing boat.

69
00:06:45,211 --> 00:06:50,080
Nice sunbathing, swimming, sleeping.

70
00:07:08,451 --> 00:07:10,681
Come on.

71
00:07:10,851 --> 00:07:13,126
Mom, we're going back.

72
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:15,282
Boots.

73
00:07:17,731 --> 00:07:19,801
That is not .

74
00:07:42,771 --> 00:07:44,523
Sitting.

75
00:07:51,931 --> 00:07:56,800
The August 15th Movement
takes flight. Stay put.

76
00:07:59,411 --> 00:08:02,244
Stay put. It's okay.

77
00:08:03,771 --> 00:08:08,447
We are being hijacked.
We are being hijacked.

78
00:08:08,611 --> 00:08:10,966
Thanks, friend. Well done.

79
00:08:13,531 --> 00:08:16,682
Takeoff. Flying.

80
00:08:55,211 --> 00:08:59,409
Here captain Mays.
The situation is very dangerous.

81
00:08:59,571 --> 00:09:04,167
This is a U.S. aircraft.
Say Foreign Affairs...

82
00:09:04,331 --> 00:09:07,960
Them in an hour
$ 50,000,000 wish.

83
00:09:08,891 --> 00:09:12,964
I do not negotiate.
We're all going to.

84
00:09:23,171 --> 00:09:28,245
The money is now created.
Let the others stand ready.

85
00:09:46,171 --> 00:09:49,447
Okay?
-Yes.

86
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,805
He peed his pants.

87
00:09:57,771 --> 00:09:59,489
'll Be fine.

88
00:10:10,011 --> 00:10:11,888
I love you.

89
00:10:34,891 --> 00:10:36,882
To our requirements.

90
00:10:37,051 --> 00:10:43,047
The August 15th Movement
Therefore let all the women and children Fri

91
00:10:43,211 --> 00:10:45,805
All others must wait.

92
00:10:50,251 --> 00:10:52,970
Let  bags here. Come forward.

93
00:10:53,131 --> 00:10:55,361
Grab your stuff, Andrew.

94
00:10:56,971 --> 00:11:00,725
Go along with mom. I come later.

95
00:11:00,891 --> 00:11:03,041
Stay with your mother.

96
00:13:06,571 --> 00:13:09,881
Mommy, help me.

97
00:14:32,011 --> 00:14:34,969
As if all your limbs...

98
00:14:35,131 --> 00:14:39,044
Very slowly be deducted.

99
00:15:03,531 --> 00:15:08,082
It's late. Dress it out,

100
00:15:35,531 --> 00:15:37,726
Go on, boy.

101
00:15:40,491 --> 00:15:42,527
Crying helps.

102
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,682
Not at all.

103
00:15:51,411 --> 00:15:54,050
No, you're right.

104
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,361
It does not help.

105
00:16:46,451 --> 00:16:50,046
You're early.
-I try the files for.

106
00:16:59,971 --> 00:17:03,680
I'm trying to understand.

107
00:17:05,011 --> 00:17:08,242
It to me to work.
It seems so...

108
00:17:31,771 --> 00:17:33,887
It was a beautiful service.

109
00:17:34,051 --> 00:17:36,246
She liked you very much.

110
00:17:36,411 --> 00:17:38,686
Why I did not stay.

111
00:17:38,851 --> 00:17:42,890
When it comes to emotions,
I am nowhere.

112
00:17:43,051 --> 00:17:46,885
I have no milk, but...
-It only takes a minute.

113
00:17:48,491 --> 00:17:53,565
The Sûreté, our embassy
these photos sent. They are from the CIA.

114
00:17:53,731 --> 00:17:58,759
These are lvanic Loyvek

115
00:17:58,931 --> 00:18:03,004
What is this?
-It is announced today.

116
00:18:03,171 --> 00:18:06,686
I thought that I could tell you better.

117
00:18:06,851 --> 00:18:08,967
What?

118
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:14,364
These are the surviving hijackers.
They were released two days ago.

119
00:18:14,531 --> 00:18:17,568
No indictment. No arrest.

120
00:18:20,691 --> 00:18:22,966
Not believe.

121
00:18:23,131 --> 00:18:26,282
It's true.
They are at liberty.

122
00:18:32,491 --> 00:18:37,884
There is no precedent in
national or international law.

123
00:18:38,051 --> 00:18:41,248
And it is morally reprehensible.

124
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:46,690
The Minister of Foreign Affairs should
next week a motion at the UN.

125
00:18:46,851 --> 00:18:51,367
If someone can prove that the U.S. has paid the ransom...

126
00:18:51,531 --> 00:18:53,920
You might have a case there.

127
00:18:58,371 --> 00:19:01,522
I'm sorry that we could not do.

128
00:19:18,971 --> 00:19:22,520
What did the government?
-How does your son is?

129
00:19:22,691 --> 00:19:27,162
I want to say that the British and American governments...

130
00:19:27,331 --> 00:19:30,687
Should do something for the hijackers to justice.

131
00:19:30,851 --> 00:19:35,845
There are 15 deaths.
My wife, my daughters...

132
00:19:36,011 --> 00:19:40,448
And neither the U.S., nor the British government...

133
00:19:40,611 --> 00:19:43,171
Should they just let you down.

134
00:19:43,331 --> 00:19:46,209
What do you want the government doing?

135
00:19:46,371 --> 00:19:49,841
The hijackers justice. Nothing more.

136
00:19:51,171 --> 00:19:53,241
Thanks for your help.

137
00:19:54,091 --> 00:19:58,562
Let the Russians they put pressure on, Senator.

138
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:03,680
Marley Wilson, New Yor tiimes.
And you have to call back Bobby.

139
00:20:03,851 --> 00:20:08,720
I would really appreciate it if you can call your
committee.

140
00:20:08,891 --> 00:20:11,359
Thank you.

141
00:20:11,531 --> 00:20:13,283
Waste of time.

142
00:20:16,931 --> 00:20:19,968
I hoped al Could you...

143
00:20:21,251 --> 00:20:23,287
That would be great.

144
00:20:25,171 --> 00:20:29,608
Does anyone on the U.S. embassy
what really happened?

145
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:33,969
Davidson, the American negotiator
in Cyprus.

146
00:20:34,131 --> 00:20:37,203
Not a very high,
but he is not so timid.

147
00:20:37,371 --> 00:20:40,044
Have I met him when Bush was here?

148
00:20:40,211 --> 00:20:43,487
I'll make an appointment.
Your office?

149
00:20:47,491 --> 00:20:52,770
Ln Washington comes
discussed in the Senate and then in Congress.

150
00:20:52,931 --> 00:20:57,049
And what's it up to?
A motion of censure?

151
00:20:57,211 --> 00:21:00,009
Here are the murderers of fear.

152
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,930
You do not even know that the Serbs.

153
00:21:04,091 --> 00:21:08,642
The U.S. has little room to maneuver.

154
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:15,570
Sorry, but everyone says.
And nobody does anything.

155
00:21:16,891 --> 00:21:22,488
Since the demise of the Soviet Union
is full of these gangs.

156
00:21:22,651 --> 00:21:26,564
All have security specialists.

157
00:21:26,731 --> 00:21:30,121
And a problem:
they talk to each other.

158
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:35,206
Our information comes from contacts that we have, insiders.

159
00:21:36,411 --> 00:21:38,163
Your kind of work.

160
00:21:41,651 --> 00:21:43,448
Where are you going?

161
00:21:46,451 --> 00:21:50,524
Can we completely off the record talk?

162
00:21:50,691 --> 00:21:52,329
Walk with me.

163
00:21:58,331 --> 00:22:02,927
Officially we are powerless.
There is nothing happening.

164
00:22:03,091 --> 00:22:08,119
If you want to get something done, you need to set
glitches make.

165
00:22:09,171 --> 00:22:11,241
How?

166
00:22:11,411 --> 00:22:14,528
Help me to help you.

167
00:22:14,691 --> 00:22:18,730
Journalists know how to get a foot in the door.

168
00:22:18,891 --> 00:22:24,761
Every week there seems to be a scandal.
-But we are not a tabloid.

169
00:22:24,931 --> 00:22:29,209
I will try to help you.
On discreetly.

170
00:22:29,371 --> 00:22:35,207
If you discovered something interesting...
Those things happen. Unofficially.

171
00:22:35,371 --> 00:22:40,445
My son has no mother.
He ​​needs me.

172
00:22:40,611 --> 00:22:43,887
Perhaps you owe them more.

173
00:23:07,691 --> 00:23:10,000
Mrs. Tarnower?

174
00:23:10,171 --> 00:23:16,690
Your husband was involved in the hijacking of the plane in Limassol.

175
00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:25,800
Do you know why his name was not on the victim
list in the newspaper?

176
00:23:36,611 --> 00:23:39,409
Thank you.

177
00:23:48,491 --> 00:23:50,527
Whoever you are, get lost.

178
00:23:51,211 --> 00:23:52,929
Kate...

179
00:24:04,731 --> 00:24:07,848
I'm sorry...
-I need your help.

180
00:24:08,971 --> 00:24:15,410
My best article ever I love you.
No one knew you was the source.

181
00:24:15,571 --> 00:24:19,610
I know.
But then I got no promotion.

182
00:24:19,771 --> 00:24:24,720
It probably had more to do with my tits
than my work.

183
00:24:24,891 --> 00:24:27,530
I got a desk job.

184
00:24:29,131 --> 00:24:33,170
You've got a great research department.

185
00:24:33,331 --> 00:24:36,243
I'm not their possession.

186
00:24:38,091 --> 00:24:41,003
And you know more than most people.

187
00:24:42,691 --> 00:24:45,364
Are you flatter me or to decorate?

188
00:24:48,651 --> 00:24:50,448
What the hell.

189
00:24:59,891 --> 00:25:02,007
Do you know him?

190
00:25:07,531 --> 00:25:10,250
Can you find out who he is?

191
00:25:10,411 --> 00:25:14,484
American? Brit?
-Josse. He sat on the plane.

192
00:25:14,651 --> 00:25:18,690
He was shot,
but he is not on the list.

193
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:21,206
What are you looking for?

194
00:25:23,371 --> 00:25:25,805
I'm trying to figure out...

195
00:25:25,971 --> 00:25:28,201
What's going on.

196
00:25:28,371 --> 00:25:32,728
These people are released.
Was that a secret deal?

197
00:25:32,891 --> 00:25:37,407
Are the Americans behind?
No one tells me anything.

198
00:25:37,571 --> 00:25:43,726
You are looking  them, huh? It's scum. Even
governments have no control.

199
00:25:43,891 --> 00:25:48,567
It does not matter who they have to kill or why.

200
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:53,884
And they do not like
if you are looking for.

201
00:25:56,531 --> 00:25:59,250
I was not going to tell them.

202
00:25:59,411 --> 00:26:01,720
This is all I have.

203
00:26:03,331 --> 00:26:08,166
I wanted to maybe buy a boat.
A sailboat.

204
00:26:08,331 --> 00:26:12,643
Nine meters long. Cabin on it.
A nice thing.

205
00:26:12,811 --> 00:26:15,609
For a holiday or a flight?

206
00:26:17,931 --> 00:26:19,683
Who knows.

207
00:26:19,851 --> 00:26:24,800
You always think they're somewhere else
. But they're here.

208
00:26:24,971 --> 00:26:30,409
France is a police state.
Germany has an efficient police.

209
00:26:35,251 --> 00:26:37,367
No one seeks them here.

210
00:26:37,531 --> 00:26:41,410
And your cells have
beds, tap water and TV.

211
00:26:42,051 --> 00:26:45,600
So I should just see if I can loswroeten
.

212
00:26:48,131 --> 00:26:49,962
And then?

213
00:26:51,131 --> 00:26:55,363
Downing Street asking for a protest to?

214
00:26:56,611 --> 00:26:59,079
That seems very sensible.

215
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:01,082
For whom?

216
00:27:01,251 --> 00:27:06,120
Can I borrow your phone?
Mine is on the embassy.

217
00:27:11,691 --> 00:27:16,481
I wish I could help you. But
because of my job, I can not.

218
00:27:18,331 --> 00:27:20,606
They all say that.

219
00:27:21,771 --> 00:27:24,729
I'm sorry, wrong number.

220
00:27:26,731 --> 00:27:30,007
Sometimes what you want at your fingertips.

221
00:27:52,331 --> 00:27:56,165
The Free Serbian Press.
What can I do for you?

222
00:27:59,451 --> 00:28:02,921
I got it.
The editor called Matanovic.

223
00:28:03,091 --> 00:28:06,083
I will look what I can find about him.

224
00:28:20,691 --> 00:28:24,320
I'm looking for Mr. Matanovic.
-Right there.

225
00:28:30,131 --> 00:28:36,366
Can you tell me what you know of
August 15th Movement?

226
00:28:36,531 --> 00:28:38,328
No one knows them.

227
00:28:38,491 --> 00:28:42,200
Says the date August 15 for something?

228
00:28:42,371 --> 00:28:47,650
Nothing at all. If I knew what,
I have informed the authorities.

229
00:28:47,811 --> 00:28:51,565
I leave this behind for
if you remember anything.

230
00:28:54,571 --> 00:28:57,722
Can you help me? With whatever.

231
00:29:05,531 --> 00:29:08,807
It might be nothing, but more
I have not.

232
00:29:08,971 --> 00:29:12,680
A house in Albert Dock where
meetings.

233
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:16,082
I do not believe in the killing of innocents.

234
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:36,082
He expected you al

235
00:36:43,371 --> 00:36:45,123
Jules Bernard.

236
00:36:46,171 --> 00:36:48,082
FBI.

237
00:36:49,211 --> 00:36:52,521
He's with us.
-Flown First Class?

238
00:36:54,571 --> 00:36:59,167
He lets you see
official documents showing...

239
00:36:59,331 --> 00:37:01,765
We are fond of.

240
00:37:01,931 --> 00:37:03,808
I love me quiet.

241
00:37:05,531 --> 00:37:11,083
Welcome to London. They say it is
hip again, but I know nothing about.

242
00:37:25,091 --> 00:37:26,729
Why are you still on?

243
00:37:26,891 --> 00:37:29,246
Small monkey of me.
-You're home.

244
00:37:29,411 --> 00:37:32,881
He could not sleep, so we went
cards.

245
00:37:44,531 --> 00:37:48,843
The three men were released are in Europe.

246
00:37:49,011 --> 00:37:54,961
There is protested by
State Department and the U.S. Secretary Loomis.

247
00:37:55,131 --> 00:37:57,691
I read.

248
00:37:57,851 --> 00:38:02,049
What is "protest"?
-He accepts my definition.

249
00:38:03,371 --> 00:38:05,726
You go upstairs.

250
00:38:07,011 --> 00:38:09,650
Then I tell you that my definition.

251
00:38:28,571 --> 00:38:30,801
You look like shit.

252
00:38:33,851 --> 00:38:36,365
And I can know.

253
00:38:36,531 --> 00:38:39,603
Have you discovered something about that bald?

254
00:38:41,051 --> 00:38:44,282
A courier. Some bobo.

255
00:38:44,451 --> 00:38:47,488
What did he have with him?
-No idea.

256
00:38:48,691 --> 00:38:50,602
I do not know.

257
00:38:57,691 --> 00:38:59,488
Are you okay?

258
00:38:59,651 --> 00:39:01,881
I have some papers with me.

259
00:39:03,371 --> 00:39:08,729
It's probably nothing,
but you can translate them for me?

260
00:39:26,131 --> 00:39:28,326
A Serbia r.

261
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:32,450
Assassin.
Never afraid to return.

262
00:39:32,611 --> 00:39:34,283
Wait, Jack.

263
00:39:35,211 --> 00:39:41,650
If you've got there broke
and those papers have stolen...

264
00:39:41,811 --> 00:39:46,202
Why do I ask it?
-Then I'm a murderer.

265
00:39:46,371 --> 00:39:50,967
Self defense is not murder.
-Unless it feels good.

266
00:39:54,011 --> 00:39:58,163
Everyone has dreams.
-And yours are about weapons?

267
00:40:03,371 --> 00:40:08,126
And indescribable tools...

268
00:40:08,291 --> 00:40:10,088
To torture.

269
00:40:23,531 --> 00:40:26,329
They are a bit impatient.

270
00:40:26,851 --> 00:40:32,847
I'm three minutes late. Let them
even 1000 years waiting to vote.

271
00:40:38,011 --> 00:40:40,161
I'm talking about women.

272
00:40:41,211 --> 00:40:43,850
The top expects you a little...

273
00:40:44,011 --> 00:40:47,720
This jacket is standard here?

274
00:40:49,931 --> 00:40:54,049
There is no dress code.
-Pity.

275
00:40:54,211 --> 00:40:56,964
And the people I wanted to have?

276
00:40:57,131 --> 00:41:02,080
You have five juniors
assigned. And me.

277
00:41:09,011 --> 00:41:13,448
The dead in Shepherd's Bush Serf.
The Bosnian named Leo Hasse.

278
00:41:13,731 --> 00:41:16,165
A political assassin.

279
00:41:16,811 --> 00:41:18,324
That's it.

280
00:41:20,451 --> 00:41:23,284
They probably had something in common.

281
00:41:23,451 --> 00:41:26,887
Yes, they're all dead.

282
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:31,442
How can you be so sure this
something has to do with politics?

283
00:41:31,611 --> 00:41:35,570
Everything is politics.
Philosophically speaking.

284
00:41:35,731 --> 00:41:41,249
I suspect that the thieves were.
-If you want evidence or suspicions?

285
00:41:41,411 --> 00:41:43,003
Hoods, Jules.

286
00:41:43,171 --> 00:41:47,323
It was an American plane.
That's why Jules here.

287
00:41:47,491 --> 00:41:50,005
To $ 50 million to trace.

288
00:41:50,171 --> 00:41:52,639
And to bring the perpetrators to account.

289
00:41:52,811 --> 00:41:56,440
He has unlimited co-
get.

290
00:41:56,611 --> 00:42:01,969
That's a long time since someone I
'unlimited' I hear you say.

291
00:42:11,091 --> 00:42:14,128
Maybe it's better if you take leave.

292
00:42:14,291 --> 00:42:17,840
Write a book,
go to the beach.

293
00:42:18,011 --> 00:42:21,686
Better for whom?
-Go to a therapist.

294
00:42:21,851 --> 00:42:27,084
In order to process your anger.
-My anger is all I have left.

295
00:42:27,251 --> 00:42:31,403
If you take away,
I can shake it.

296
00:42:33,371 --> 00:42:37,569
Mr. Dusan, have you heard that
Maldic arrives at St Pancras?

297
00:42:37,731 --> 00:42:40,199
You should not have called me.

298
00:42:40,371 --> 00:42:44,967
Should I come to you?
-This conversation is pointless.

299
00:42:45,131 --> 00:42:48,567
Do you sometimes prefer
I come home with you?

300
00:42:49,571 --> 00:42:53,644
Okay. Tonight at ten o'clock
the old market.

301
00:42:53,811 --> 00:42:55,881
Then.

302
00:43:08,851 --> 00:43:13,720
If 15 oranges 6 pounds 75 costs...

303
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:16,644
How much does an orange then?

304
00:43:19,731 --> 00:43:22,928
45 pence.
-Right.

305
00:43:24,211 --> 00:43:28,329
I had you still help? Answers
-giving is not helping.

306
00:43:28,491 --> 00:43:32,120
That is to say.
I tested you briefly.

307
00:43:33,171 --> 00:43:35,526
Goodnight, genius.

308
00:43:37,371 --> 00:43:40,249
I have another nightmare.

309
00:43:40,411 --> 00:43:44,324
There was someone in the house
looking for something.

310
00:43:45,171 --> 00:43:47,605
We will soon be gone.

311
00:43:47,771 --> 00:43:52,322
Then we sail with a boat
to where the wind takes us.

312
00:43:52,491 --> 00:43:54,607
You're talking like your neck.

313
00:45:26,131 --> 00:45:29,919
You have your sister beaten, says mum.
Is that so?

314
00:45:30,091 --> 00:45:32,651
You have the words to cope with this.

315
00:45:32,811 --> 00:45:34,961
Apologize.

316
00:45:35,131 --> 00:45:37,565
Goodnight. Give me mommy moment.

317
00:45:37,731 --> 00:45:40,689
Should she leave? I should also hang.

318
00:45:44,971 --> 00:45:46,927
Sorry, hearing.

319
00:45:47,091 --> 00:45:50,049
Ordinary life goes on.

320
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:56,443
We think Albert Dock
went to a fight about money.

321
00:45:56,611 --> 00:46:00,081
But Mr. Bernard
is not agree.

322
00:46:00,251 --> 00:46:06,884
One of the weapons is also used for killing
Dusan Velikovic.

323
00:46:07,051 --> 00:46:10,168
And what's the connection?
-I wish I knew.

324
00:46:11,491 --> 00:46:13,209
Money.

325
00:46:13,371 --> 00:46:17,842
We examine hairs and palm prints. Anything can be.

326
00:46:18,011 --> 00:46:25,201
But that still does nothing. Money is not
't only motive for these murders.

327
00:46:26,251 --> 00:46:31,200
With the right motive can we invent
perhaps related.

328
00:46:32,371 --> 00:46:36,046
It would be nice if anyone was killed.

329
00:46:58,891 --> 00:47:00,643
Welcome to St. Pancras.

330
00:47:00,811 --> 00:47:04,963
Never leave your luggage unattended.

331
00:47:05,131 --> 00:47:10,649
Unattended baggage must be reported to the stationmaster.

332
00:47:54,331 --> 00:47:58,290
Are there any messages for me?
-Yes, one.

333
00:47:58,451 --> 00:48:00,521
A pleasant stay.

334
00:49:32,051 --> 00:49:39,639
He looks to his knees and says:
Knees, today you have become 84.

335
00:49:39,811 --> 00:49:42,006
He looks down again...

336
00:49:42,171 --> 00:49:45,800
And looks at the part where you just though and says:

337
00:49:45,971 --> 00:49:48,531
And as for you...

338
00:49:49,531 --> 00:49:53,444
If you had lived,
were you today become 84.

339
00:49:57,291 --> 00:49:59,680
I just grab your change.

340
00:49:59,851 --> 00:50:02,888
This is undrinkable. It has cork.

341
00:50:03,051 --> 00:50:05,121
Not that expensive words.

342
00:50:05,291 --> 00:50:08,124
Try it.
No, I do not drink.

343
00:50:08,291 --> 00:50:12,967
I do not care, it's undrinkable.
-Keep my glass throughout.

344
00:50:13,131 --> 00:50:16,646
Do not interfere with my customers.
You go.

345
00:51:41,451 --> 00:51:45,239
And now I ask Mr. Peter John
back on stage...

346
00:51:45,411 --> 00:51:49,404
With the beautiful song
After the War to sing.

347
00:52:01,931 --> 00:52:04,320
Sorry I did unkind.

348
00:52:04,491 --> 00:52:06,049
You have those days.

349
00:52:06,211 --> 00:52:10,409
But the show was wonderful.
-So you'll come back again?

350
00:52:10,571 --> 00:52:12,562
And then a little nicer, eh?

351
00:52:39,811 --> 00:52:42,883
The calls he committed.

352
00:52:44,171 --> 00:52:46,002
We work really that bad.

353
00:52:49,811 --> 00:52:51,642
St. Pancras.

354
00:52:52,691 --> 00:52:54,727
Good work.

355
00:52:54,891 --> 00:52:58,088
St. Pancras.
-My favorite station.

356
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:07,010
Karadan Maldic is a taxi driver
£ 1 30 guilty.

357
00:53:07,171 --> 00:53:11,528
But there were 100,000 Swiss francs in his locker.

358
00:53:11,691 --> 00:53:14,922
And some very interesting documents.

359
00:53:15,891 --> 00:53:19,406
For those who do not know Serbian...

360
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:23,610
There are two times a few
very American words:

361
00:53:23,771 --> 00:53:26,604
$ 50,000,000.

362
00:53:27,891 --> 00:53:30,610
The slachtofferwas one of the hijackers.

363
00:53:30,771 --> 00:53:32,727
What was he doing here?

364
00:53:32,891 --> 00:53:37,282
He was involved in the Balkan gangs
and Albert Dock.

365
00:53:37,451 --> 00:53:40,124
Good work, Jules.

366
00:53:40,291 --> 00:53:43,681
Foreign Affairs wants his money back.

367
00:53:43,851 --> 00:53:48,322
That money's evidence.
-They look much more.

368
00:53:48,491 --> 00:53:50,959
Once we found it.

369
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:02,444
We have something overlooked.

370
00:54:02,611 --> 00:54:05,409
Check that passenger list again.

371
00:54:05,571 --> 00:54:09,564
Every survivor needs to be questioned.

372
00:54:09,731 --> 00:54:12,962
I'm their declarations
again read.

373
00:54:13,131 --> 00:54:16,806
Check
anyone who has lost a family member.

374
00:54:21,371 --> 00:54:25,000
A list of 15 Britons
who survived...

375
00:54:25,171 --> 00:54:27,639
Or family of the dead.

376
00:54:27,811 --> 00:54:32,248
Note Slavic connections,
a military background...

377
00:54:32,411 --> 00:54:34,288
Or an academic degree.

378
00:54:34,451 --> 00:54:37,761
Someone knows more than we do and pops them upside down.

379
00:54:37,931 --> 00:54:41,890
And he she us on a silver platter delivered.

380
00:54:43,251 --> 00:54:46,084
There is burgled last week.

381
00:54:46,251 --> 00:54:47,809
Oh yeah?

382
00:54:48,891 --> 00:54:52,042
What were they?
-My arms.

383
00:54:53,411 --> 00:54:57,962
A couple of guys who murdered
hijackers seem to be.

384
00:55:02,131 --> 00:55:03,530
Pity.

385
00:55:03,691 --> 00:55:08,640
I've heard that the leader of that
hijacking in Paris.

386
00:55:09,771 --> 00:55:12,843
Oh yeah? What's his name?

387
00:55:13,011 --> 00:55:15,445
His name lvanic Loyvek.

388
00:55:17,211 --> 00:55:21,648
This is a strange rabbit.
-I reacted purely instinctive.

389
00:55:37,971 --> 00:55:43,568
I'm Jules Bernard. I work together with the
antiterrorist unit in London.

390
00:55:44,371 --> 00:55:47,204
I already made a statement.

391
00:55:47,371 --> 00:55:49,327
These are just...

392
00:55:49,491 --> 00:55:52,369
Do you want a cup of coffee?

393
00:55:54,211 --> 00:55:55,963
Seat.

394
00:55:56,131 --> 00:55:58,201
No, I prefer to stand.

395
00:56:11,611 --> 00:56:15,524
Can you tell me where you
Friday after eight uurwas?

396
00:56:18,931 --> 00:56:20,922
This was still on Cyprus?

397
00:56:21,091 --> 00:56:24,925
Everything has to do with each.

398
00:56:25,091 --> 00:56:29,960
Really, this is just a routine...
-A routine examination.

399
00:56:30,131 --> 00:56:32,486
But why Friday?

400
00:56:32,651 --> 00:56:37,042
For a country where citizens
no weapons allowed to wear...

401
00:56:37,211 --> 00:56:39,805
There are many deaths.

402
00:56:39,971 --> 00:56:42,565
I'm an editor at a magazine.

403
00:56:42,731 --> 00:56:44,881
Friday?

404
00:56:45,051 --> 00:56:47,929
I'm gone to the West End.

405
00:56:48,091 --> 00:56:51,925
In an old-fashioned musical
at The Players Theatre.

406
00:56:52,091 --> 00:56:56,528
We did previously.
I hoped it would happen to me some.

407
00:56:56,691 --> 00:56:59,922
Jean, The Players Theatre.

408
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:05,369
Check one
Jack Elgin was there at eight o'clock.

409
00:57:05,531 --> 00:57:09,126
What time did you leave?
-When the show was over.

410
00:57:09,291 --> 00:57:12,363
Right. And what time was that?

411
00:57:12,531 --> 00:57:14,761
Half-elf, quarter to eleven.

412
00:57:15,811 --> 00:57:18,325
Half-elf, quarter to eleven.

413
00:57:23,851 --> 00:57:27,764
I hope we do not have to fall back tricky.

414
00:57:30,211 --> 00:57:31,769
Thanks.

415
00:57:33,531 --> 00:57:36,523
Where you parked that night?

416
00:57:36,691 --> 00:57:39,125
I am gone underground.

417
00:57:40,051 --> 00:57:46,320
Can we see a trace evidence
into the use of firearms?

418
00:57:46,491 --> 00:57:52,680
That makes no sense. I am Saturday with friends
been hunting. Rabbits.

419
00:57:52,851 --> 00:57:56,526
What hit?
-I'm a bad shooter. Two, three.

420
00:57:56,691 --> 00:57:58,443
And a pheasant.

421
00:57:59,811 --> 00:58:02,041
Thanks for coming.

422
00:58:03,491 --> 00:58:08,167
... A theory that the murderers
with hijacking face.

423
00:58:08,331 --> 00:58:12,165
Maybe I like
on the trail of the hijackers.

424
00:58:12,331 --> 00:58:18,088
We have 40 people spoke,
relatives of the victims.

425
00:58:18,251 --> 00:58:20,845
We have no suspects.

426
00:58:22,251 --> 00:58:24,367
And Jack Elgin?

427
00:58:26,531 --> 00:58:30,080
Jack Elgin.
He ​​wanted me to speak last month.

428
00:58:30,251 --> 00:58:31,604
Why?

429
00:58:31,771 --> 00:58:35,286
The withholding evidence is a crime.

430
00:58:35,451 --> 00:58:40,889
I got the strong feeling that he was looking
...

431
00:58:41,051 --> 00:58:44,248
To unofficial help.

432
00:58:44,411 --> 00:58:47,608
What?
-Finding the killers.

433
00:58:47,771 --> 00:58:49,602
Nonsense.

434
00:58:49,771 --> 00:58:52,285
What about there with you?

435
00:58:52,451 --> 00:58:58,367
Why did Karadan Maldic
from his hotel to your embassy?

436
00:58:58,531 --> 00:59:00,647
I'll figure it out.

437
00:59:02,571 --> 00:59:08,521
I was told that we still have a
hijacker localized. In Paris.

438
00:59:08,691 --> 00:59:10,602
Lvanic Loyvek.

439
00:59:10,771 --> 00:59:13,888
We think he their leiderwas.

440
00:59:14,451 --> 00:59:19,081
Not bad, huh?
-Do you have the French police?

441
00:59:19,251 --> 00:59:22,687
I light up.
My French is not good enough.

442
00:59:22,851 --> 00:59:26,890
I want the names of everyone who
thereof is.

443
00:59:27,051 --> 00:59:30,521
Do not think that you can sew me, Bernard.

444
00:59:41,611 --> 00:59:44,125
Sweet, huh? Have fun.

445
00:59:46,611 --> 00:59:48,408
Thanks, Kate.

446
00:59:48,571 --> 00:59:50,960
Wait, I gotta tell you something.

447
00:59:51,131 --> 00:59:54,203
I do not wanna hear.
-Shut up.

448
00:59:54,371 --> 00:59:59,445
There are rules. Eye for an eye, says Moses.
Turn the other cheek, says Jesus.

449
00:59:59,611 --> 01:00:03,399
Those bastards programs are free.
-The law does not always triumph.

450
01:00:03,571 --> 01:00:07,086
Innocent die.
Criminals live.

451
01:00:07,251 --> 01:00:10,323
You need to know who you are.

452
01:00:10,491 --> 01:00:15,042
Do not lose yourself.
That would be a crime.

453
01:00:15,211 --> 01:00:17,884
Whatever mistakes you have committed.

454
01:02:16,291 --> 01:02:19,010
Should you so hard? The lime...

455
01:02:33,411 --> 01:02:35,402
My dochterwil eat.

456
01:03:47,171 --> 01:03:50,208
Good afternoon. Are you Stephane Marit?

457
01:03:50,371 --> 01:03:52,646
Can we see your papers?

458
01:03:54,091 --> 01:03:55,922
I'll be.

459
01:04:05,811 --> 01:04:09,599
The girl in the pub remembers him.
The time is correct.

460
01:04:09,771 --> 01:04:15,084
He had never enough time.
-Why you mark him or not?

461
01:04:16,651 --> 01:04:20,564
Maybe because that girl said that he complained.

462
01:04:20,731 --> 01:04:24,326
Or because he said that he was a bad schutterwas.

463
01:04:26,091 --> 01:04:31,245
But mainly because it all
very fortuitous.

464
01:04:33,371 --> 01:04:36,807
He was going hunting.

465
01:04:39,051 --> 01:04:40,689
Rabbits.

466
01:04:42,091 --> 01:04:44,446
And a pheasant, which is not allowed.

467
01:04:45,731 --> 01:04:49,041
Kulindos says that the off season.

468
01:05:16,931 --> 01:05:21,607
Sat Simons at the restaurant?
Have you checked?

469
01:05:22,971 --> 01:05:26,486
His friend took him to the train from Paris.

470
01:05:26,651 --> 01:05:30,007
Maldic was killed with a Walther Automatic.

471
01:05:30,171 --> 01:05:33,686
And who was there last week
one lost?

472
01:05:35,531 --> 01:05:37,806
I want to talk to him.

473
01:05:37,971 --> 01:05:41,008
Find him. I want to talk to him.

474
01:05:48,011 --> 01:05:50,445
This is the main agent Kulindos.

475
01:05:50,611 --> 01:05:53,171
And this is Jack Elgin.

476
01:05:53,331 --> 01:05:55,606
Come on, Andrew.
-I need your help.

477
01:05:55,771 --> 01:05:57,204
Give me your bag.

478
01:06:00,011 --> 01:06:03,128
Ever heard of one Davidson?
Of Foreign Affairs.

479
01:06:04,611 --> 01:06:08,490
Your government did not cooperate.

480
01:06:08,651 --> 01:06:13,771
He ​​has encouraged you to see what you could rake up, huh?

481
01:06:15,691 --> 01:06:17,886
You can tell me.

482
01:06:21,331 --> 01:06:23,526
That was all.

483
01:06:30,691 --> 01:06:35,845
Give your wallet.
-You heard him. Hurry up.

484
01:06:48,451 --> 01:06:53,650
I had to catch up.
-I'm glad that finally happens.

485
01:06:53,811 --> 01:06:58,885
I was screwed. Also American,
good connections, they said.

486
01:07:00,691 --> 01:07:03,649
I close the file-Elgin.

487
01:07:04,731 --> 01:07:09,282
No proof. No weapon.
No witness.

488
01:07:09,451 --> 01:07:13,080
And a very good alibi.
-And a very good motive.

489
01:07:13,251 --> 01:07:15,606
He is not addressing.

490
01:07:15,771 --> 01:07:19,650
The head of the CIA
would still vouch for him.

491
01:07:19,811 --> 01:07:21,847
Yes, I really do.

492
01:07:22,011 --> 01:07:27,847
He was in Paris when
lvanic officer who slammed down.

493
01:07:28,011 --> 01:07:30,002
Can I have a glass of water?

494
01:07:41,171 --> 01:07:45,687
You must surely go to Paris?
-Maybe it's better this way.

495
01:07:45,851 --> 01:07:47,762
Him alone.

496
01:07:49,651 --> 01:07:52,927
Yes, I think that is wise.

497
01:07:55,691 --> 01:07:57,409
Tentative.

498
01:07:57,571 --> 01:07:59,402
Let him alone.

499
01:07:59,571 --> 01:08:01,368
I will.

500
01:08:05,971 --> 01:08:09,566
Are you all right, Bernard?

501
01:08:10,491 --> 01:08:12,641
It's getting better.

502
01:08:13,771 --> 01:08:18,287
Napoleon said an enemy
committed when he makes a mistake.

503
01:08:19,971 --> 01:08:22,531
All I need to report.

504
01:08:26,491 --> 01:08:30,006
Book a flight to Washington DC.

505
01:08:30,171 --> 01:08:32,810
From Heathrow, around six o'clock.

506
01:08:33,731 --> 01:08:36,609
Make sure you're here continuously.

507
01:08:36,771 --> 01:08:39,365
What you need, let you bring.

508
01:08:39,531 --> 01:08:43,524
If you hear anything, call me.
And nobody else.

509
01:08:43,691 --> 01:08:46,444
Except when I'm dead.

510
01:08:46,611 --> 01:08:48,841
And what if I have to pee?

511
01:08:57,691 --> 01:08:59,329
Come.

512
01:09:00,371 --> 01:09:03,249
It's beautiful. There is a kitchen.

513
01:09:03,411 --> 01:09:08,610
And beds. Everything is there.
You can live there.

514
01:09:08,771 --> 01:09:12,127
A fine boat.
Thanks for looking.

515
01:09:12,291 --> 01:09:15,408
Is he inspected?
-There's nothing wrong with that.

516
01:09:15,571 --> 01:09:17,801
A coat of paint. New fall.

517
01:09:17,971 --> 01:09:20,087
But also he is fine.

518
01:09:29,571 --> 01:09:33,041
You have no more wind.
Turn the mainsail.

519
01:09:41,171 --> 01:09:43,685
Not too close to the water.

520
01:09:53,211 --> 01:09:55,771
This is me bored.

521
01:09:55,931 --> 01:09:57,569
How was Paris?

522
01:09:58,771 --> 01:10:00,887
Fun.

523
01:10:01,051 --> 01:10:04,202
Yes, so. Good.

524
01:10:04,371 --> 01:10:06,123
What were you doing there?

525
01:10:07,371 --> 01:10:12,843
That's part of my job.
I'm going a few times a month back.

526
01:10:13,011 --> 01:10:16,242
It's part of my job
things out.

527
01:10:16,411 --> 01:10:20,802
You're a tough one.
-Should I be flattered?

528
01:10:20,971 --> 01:10:22,768
Paris.

529
01:10:22,931 --> 01:10:25,206
I'm working on a story.

530
01:10:25,371 --> 01:10:27,327
French Armagnac.

531
01:10:28,571 --> 01:10:31,927
The rising star in the world of spirits.

532
01:10:32,091 --> 01:10:36,767
Armagnac. A drink, but you
chats from your neck.

533
01:10:39,491 --> 01:10:43,166
You write an article about hijackers.

534
01:10:43,331 --> 01:10:48,086
You knew lvanic in Paris Sat
Why you went there.

535
01:10:48,251 --> 01:10:50,765
So?
-How did you know he was there?

536
01:10:50,931 --> 01:10:52,683
Sources.

537
01:10:56,491 --> 01:10:58,527
Did you find him?
-No.

538
01:11:00,651 --> 01:11:07,409
The police also went to see him, but he shot them dead
and escaped.

539
01:11:07,571 --> 01:11:11,359
He ​​left his daughter in their bodies behind.

540
01:11:11,531 --> 01:11:13,999
Did you want to murder him?

541
01:11:16,211 --> 01:11:18,600
That solves nothing.

542
01:11:18,771 --> 01:11:22,969
If the murderer of my family
would meet...

543
01:11:23,131 --> 01:11:25,281
I would want him dead.

544
01:11:25,451 --> 01:11:30,571
A civilized man distinguishes between
and want to do.

545
01:11:30,731 --> 01:11:33,529
And you've always been civilized?

546
01:11:36,571 --> 01:11:38,801
I was tracking a terrorist.

547
01:11:38,971 --> 01:11:44,125
And suddenly there are three dead
in Albert Dock, one in a taxi...

548
01:11:44,291 --> 01:11:49,649
And someone somewhere in a market.
Do you know anything about that?

549
01:11:49,811 --> 01:11:52,450
Only what I read in the papers.

550
01:11:57,011 --> 01:12:01,209
The guy in the taxi, Karadan Maldic...

551
01:12:02,451 --> 01:12:05,124
Is slain with a Walther PPK.

552
01:12:05,291 --> 01:12:09,682
Such a weapon is stolen by your best friend.

553
01:12:09,851 --> 01:12:12,843
I hate that kind of coincidences.

554
01:12:13,451 --> 01:12:16,761
Find the thief and you have your killer.

555
01:12:16,931 --> 01:12:20,128
My best friend had given me the key.

556
01:12:20,291 --> 01:12:26,127
Maybe. Did you know that your best friend
good buddies was with Davidson?

557
01:12:26,291 --> 01:12:30,250
Was?
-Francois Duguay was killed yesterday.

558
01:12:30,411 --> 01:12:32,208
Kill.

559
01:12:35,011 --> 01:12:39,766
I want all the hijackers arrested
still roam freely.

560
01:12:40,611 --> 01:12:42,806
Do you want me for help?

561
01:12:42,971 --> 01:12:44,927
I know nothing.

562
01:12:45,091 --> 01:12:48,322
I'm on your side.
Play the game with me.

563
01:12:48,491 --> 01:12:52,643
Set as those men you've killed...

564
01:12:52,811 --> 01:12:55,086
Fine, I do not care.

565
01:12:57,011 --> 01:13:00,083
And the jury will feel the same way thinking.

566
01:13:01,131 --> 01:13:07,286
I'm not very good at games.
-Duguay was murdered last night.

567
01:13:07,451 --> 01:13:09,442
And you're in danger.

568
01:13:11,011 --> 01:13:14,526
You are so close that they can hear you breathing.

569
01:13:16,811 --> 01:13:20,440
And I can protect you.
I'm more of them.

570
01:13:20,611 --> 01:13:22,806
He does not do it, Dad.

571
01:13:22,971 --> 01:13:28,284
What have you done? These belong in the
middle. You should not arrive.

572
01:13:31,331 --> 01:13:33,720
Keep them in the middle. Go.

573
01:13:33,891 --> 01:13:37,167
Who are you?
-That's a friend of mine.

574
01:13:43,731 --> 01:13:47,804
I would him in a safe place
bring. Right now.

575
01:13:50,091 --> 01:13:53,766
You must take responsibility for your child.

576
01:13:53,931 --> 01:13:56,525
Get it  Screw you, asshole.

577
01:14:03,891 --> 01:14:05,609
I want your help.

578
01:14:06,651 --> 01:14:10,326
To the murderers of your family to find.

579
01:14:11,411 --> 01:14:15,529
You have to give me something. Whatever.

580
01:14:19,171 --> 01:14:24,199
There was a diplomatic courier
on that flight. He was slain.

581
01:14:24,371 --> 01:14:27,681
Who knows has that got to do.
-Tarnower?

582
01:14:27,851 --> 01:14:30,968
Lrrelevant. This is nothing politieks.

583
01:14:31,131 --> 01:14:36,046
Well. It is August 15th Movement.
-My stupid cat called Einstein.

584
01:14:36,211 --> 01:14:39,009
It's not how you call it.

585
01:14:40,571 --> 01:14:45,520
This seemed just politics.
No, they believed in something.

586
01:14:45,691 --> 01:14:49,889
It is an ordinary robbery.
-No, that's nonsense.

587
01:14:50,051 --> 01:14:55,079
Your wife and daughters have died
for a check of 50 million.

588
01:14:55,251 --> 01:14:56,684
I do not...

589
01:14:56,851 --> 01:14:58,648
This is it.

590
01:15:00,811 --> 01:15:04,008
Let's go, Andrew. It's going to rain.

591
01:15:04,171 --> 01:15:06,401
I'm on your side.

592
01:15:11,011 --> 01:15:12,729
I'm on your side.

593
01:15:43,611 --> 01:15:45,966
Jack, I'm here.

594
01:15:46,131 --> 01:15:51,683
When I was nine, my father sent me to military school
.

595
01:15:52,891 --> 01:15:56,406
I learned everything.
Also to hide my feelings.

596
01:15:56,571 --> 01:15:59,165
Americans flaunt that still correct?

597
01:15:59,331 --> 01:16:04,121
You also boarding school.
You know what it did to us.

598
01:16:04,291 --> 01:16:07,010
You will be hard to fathom.

599
01:16:10,651 --> 01:16:15,884
In case you have not
clear, I want you to know...

600
01:16:17,371 --> 01:16:20,169
You're a decent guy.

601
01:16:24,051 --> 01:16:26,929
Vat you? You're a decent guy.

602
01:16:27,091 --> 01:16:30,766
I hope you have something interesting to say.

603
01:16:31,891 --> 01:16:36,521
Henry Davidson kluste a bit.

604
01:16:37,571 --> 01:16:40,131
So? Everyone has to eat.

605
01:16:40,291 --> 01:16:45,206
He used Francois Duguay.
-Francois Nobody used.

606
01:16:45,371 --> 01:16:49,762
He did not know he was used.
That's why he killed.

607
01:16:49,931 --> 01:16:52,843
Francois told you about lvanic, huh?

608
01:16:53,011 --> 01:16:56,367
He had again Davidson.

609
01:16:56,531 --> 01:17:00,922
But why should  Davidson,
an agent of the CIA...

610
01:17:01,091 --> 01:17:04,367
You manipulate someone to murder?

611
01:17:04,531 --> 01:17:06,408
That I did not understand...

612
01:17:06,571 --> 01:17:10,962
So I have a microphone
in Davidson's hidden room.

613
01:17:11,131 --> 01:17:15,602
The CIA searches which rooms
once a week.

614
01:17:15,771 --> 01:17:17,841
What you learned?

615
01:17:19,531 --> 01:17:23,570
Davidson led the entire operation.

616
01:17:23,731 --> 01:17:27,565
What do you mean?
-Everything. Only the hijacking itself.

617
01:17:27,731 --> 01:17:33,647
He ​​made the money to the account in Monaco.

618
01:17:33,811 --> 01:17:37,008
He ​​wanted certain people that you would find.

619
01:17:37,171 --> 01:17:41,961
You had to kill his partner.
He ​​led you right to them.

620
01:17:42,131 --> 01:17:45,601
He watched as they were slain...

621
01:17:45,771 --> 01:17:49,081
And those you missed,
he killed himself.

622
01:17:50,731 --> 01:17:55,646
There is a meeting of European finance ministers.

623
01:17:55,811 --> 01:17:59,042
Where you going, huh?
-Right.

624
01:17:59,211 --> 01:18:02,328
How do you know?
-Because he knows.

625
01:18:03,691 --> 01:18:05,522
There they go do it.

626
01:18:05,691 --> 01:18:09,809
Ln a conference center?
This is so well protected.

627
01:18:09,971 --> 01:18:12,246
You will have lunch with people.

628
01:18:12,411 --> 01:18:15,687
A stroll,
a beer in the pub.

629
01:18:15,851 --> 01:18:18,729
There are dozens of possibilities.

630
01:18:20,491 --> 01:18:22,686
I say it off.
-What?

631
01:18:22,851 --> 01:18:26,446
Then they do it another time.
If you do not want life.

632
01:18:26,611 --> 01:18:29,569
You do not constantly afraid.

633
01:18:31,371 --> 01:18:36,764
You want me to become a target.
-They have you on your back signed.

634
01:18:37,771 --> 01:18:42,526
I do not have enough evidence to arrest you
.

635
01:18:43,411 --> 01:18:45,845
But now I know something else.

636
01:18:46,011 --> 01:18:50,050
That engine of yours.
This is very casual.

637
01:18:53,051 --> 01:18:55,645
Want your son has a father?

638
01:18:56,851 --> 01:18:59,570
That is only in this way.

639
01:19:24,291 --> 01:19:29,206
Dear Jonesy, I was
lately quite closed...

640
01:19:29,371 --> 01:19:32,681
But I hope that this week all will be well.

641
01:19:32,851 --> 01:19:37,003
If not,
should you care for Andrew.

642
01:19:38,411 --> 01:19:42,040
I got you in my will as
guardian appointed.

643
01:19:42,211 --> 01:19:47,046
It's a sweet kid.
I know that you will find.

644
01:19:47,211 --> 01:19:51,523
What I did, I did for my family
...

645
01:19:51,691 --> 01:19:54,728
Whom I loved more than
of life.

646
01:19:56,011 --> 01:20:00,607
There is also a letter to Andrew.
That you give him when he's older.

647
01:20:00,771 --> 01:20:04,889
Sorry I opzadel this.
Your good friend Jack.

648
01:20:54,811 --> 01:20:59,202
This is a hand grenade.
-It's like a bomb.

649
01:20:59,371 --> 01:21:02,647
There is a delay of 12 seconds.

650
01:21:04,931 --> 01:21:07,764
Do you think the army or something?

651
01:21:07,931 --> 01:21:13,608
The police has long been well armed.
You do only if it is not.

652
01:21:13,771 --> 01:21:18,322
And then say that cigarettes are bad for you.

653
01:21:18,491 --> 01:21:23,281
The papers that I had to fill this...

654
01:21:23,451 --> 01:21:28,650
So I stole them. Kulindos
was so angry that he wanted to show me.

655
01:21:31,051 --> 01:21:36,000
I had already been home if
I had done it by the book.

656
01:21:37,771 --> 01:21:40,444
Not yet changed his mind?

657
01:22:10,451 --> 01:22:12,282
Get out.

658
01:22:18,691 --> 01:22:20,283
Take it.

659
01:22:22,571 --> 01:22:25,404
There are 15 patterns in it. Suit.

660
01:22:29,011 --> 01:22:30,729
Cartridge holder.

661
01:22:30,891 --> 01:22:32,802
And one in your pocket.

662
01:22:34,211 --> 01:22:36,088
Ready?
-And a grenade.

663
01:22:36,251 --> 01:22:38,526
And this will go away.
-Come on.

664
01:22:46,731 --> 01:22:48,608
Inside.

665
01:23:13,091 --> 01:23:14,763
Low continue.

666
01:24:01,091 --> 01:24:03,207
You can keep...

667
01:24:04,331 --> 01:24:06,640
Or you can leave.

668
01:24:09,251 --> 01:24:11,048
It's over.

669
01:24:43,171 --> 01:24:45,401
I'm glad to see you.

670
01:24:49,851 --> 01:24:51,603
Driving.

671
01:24:59,411 --> 01:25:03,040
Bernard had no permission for that microphone.

672
01:25:03,211 --> 01:25:07,762
This certificate is not valid.
Only you remain.

673
01:25:07,931 --> 01:25:10,001
And without you...

674
01:25:11,571 --> 01:25:13,050
Those stupid Bernard.

675
01:25:13,211 --> 01:25:18,888
We're in the shit because he steals things
undocumented form.

676
01:25:19,051 --> 01:25:25,206
Why? It had only 12 seconds from
last. 12 seconds.

677
01:25:25,371 --> 01:25:27,965
12 seconds. Nothing more.

678
01:25:28,131 --> 01:25:30,087
Shut up.

679
01:26:44,771 --> 01:26:48,889
To bed. Monday starts school.
-I do not.

680
01:26:50,331 --> 01:26:55,963
Saturday  If the weather is good,
shall we go sailing together?

681
01:26:57,131 --> 01:27:01,921
And if you're really good, you become the master and I
crew.

682
01:27:03,811 --> 01:27:06,120
Are you still my dad?

683
01:27:07,171 --> 01:27:09,844
From me you will not be so easy.

684
01:27:10,011 --> 01:27:13,606
And now sleep. See you tomorrow.

685
01:27:23,611 --> 01:27:26,125
Doing well, buddy.

686
01:27:27,331 --> 01:27:31,847
Do not be too hard on yourself.
He ​​is a good father.

687
01:27:32,011 --> 01:27:35,640
Who has denied what he believed.

688
01:27:35,811 --> 01:27:37,642
Except him.

689
01:27:37,971 --> 01:27:40,041
Watch the sail.

690
01:27:54,531 --> 01:27:58,240
I can do it, Dad. l can.

691
01:28:04,091 --> 01:28:08,084
And the fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun...

692
01:28:08,251 --> 01:28:12,290
And power was given him to scorch men with fire.
