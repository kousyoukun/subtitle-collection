1
00:01:21,573 --> 00:01:23,165
It's time.

2
00:01:25,243 --> 00:01:26,733
Hey there...

3
00:01:26,978 --> 00:01:30,675
...good morning. How are you today?

4
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:33,316
Hey. What are you doing up?

5
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:34,518
Moo.

6
00:01:36,354 --> 00:01:37,753
Is that Daddy?

7
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:43,956
Hey there, cowgirl.

8
00:01:44,963 --> 00:01:47,557
She's a little feisty today.

9
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,693
Babies should be sleeping.

10
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:54,503
"I'm too hungry for my own good."
Yes.

11
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,809
I gotta get ready.

12
00:02:06,051 --> 00:02:08,576
Wrong day to be forgetting stuff.

13
00:02:08,887 --> 00:02:12,015
You know how lucky you are.
Don't screw this up.

14
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,157
All right! Jesus.

15
00:02:15,126 --> 00:02:18,323
-She go back to sleep?
-Yes. Ate like a pig.

16
00:02:18,563 --> 00:02:23,865
I know I'm lucky. I ace this job,
the department's wide open.

17
00:02:24,202 --> 00:02:28,639
Get my own division someday.
You should see their houses.

18
00:02:35,547 --> 00:02:36,912
Hello?

19
00:02:40,685 --> 00:02:41,652
Well, yes.

20
00:02:42,687 --> 00:02:44,086
Don't worry, I will.

21
00:02:44,723 --> 00:02:47,214
<i>He's right here.
It's Alonzo.</i>

22
00:02:54,165 --> 00:02:55,154
<i>-Hello.
-Hoyt?</i>

23
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,424
Yes, sir.

24
00:02:56,668 --> 00:02:59,330
<i>-Going to roll call?
-I'm leaving now.</i>

25
00:02:59,571 --> 00:03:00,629
<i>-Hoyt?
-Yes, sir?</i>

26
00:03:00,872 --> 00:03:04,399
<i>-Fairies go to roll call. We don't.
-Good to know.</i>

27
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:07,805
<i>There's a coffee shop on 7th.
Be there at 10.</i>

28
00:03:08,046 --> 00:03:11,538
<i>Be in comfortable shoes.
Got a backup gun?</i>

29
00:03:11,783 --> 00:03:15,549
<i>-Only the standard issue Beretta.
-Bring it. Cuffs too.</i>

30
00:03:15,787 --> 00:03:19,245
<i>Maybe we'll do some business.
We're aggressive.</i>

31
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:24,121
I know. That's why I signed up.
I want to thank you for this--

32
00:03:33,605 --> 00:03:34,970
What's wrong?

33
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:39,609
Feels like football tryouts.

34
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:43,780
I wish it was tomorrow
so I'd know if I made the squad.

35
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:46,779
Listen, it's not tomorrow, it's today.

36
00:03:47,485 --> 00:03:50,750
-I know it's gonna work out.
-You do?

37
00:04:14,112 --> 00:04:15,579
Good morning, sir.

38
00:04:19,784 --> 00:04:21,274
No, thank you, ma'am.

39
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,953
Get some chow in you.
My dollar.

40
00:04:24,489 --> 00:04:26,457
Thank you, sir, but I ate.

41
00:04:26,691 --> 00:04:27,919
Fine. Don't.

42
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:36,257
It's nice here.

43
00:04:37,702 --> 00:04:38,691
May I read?

44
00:04:39,471 --> 00:04:41,598
-I'm sorry, sir. I--
-Thank you.

45
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,233
-I'll get something to eat.
-Hell, no you won't. You fucked up.

46
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:49,072
I'm trying to read. Please shut up.

47
00:05:08,566 --> 00:05:12,297
I'll like not being in a hot
black and white all summer.

48
00:05:17,342 --> 00:05:19,503
Tell me a story, Hoyt.

49
00:05:21,045 --> 00:05:24,481
-Like my story?
-Not your story, a story.

50
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:29,246
Since you can't shut up
so I can read, tell me a story.

51
00:05:29,554 --> 00:05:31,681
-I don't know any.
-You don't?

52
00:05:31,923 --> 00:05:33,390
-No.
-I'll tell you one.

53
00:05:33,758 --> 00:05:37,922
This is a newspaper, right?
It's 90 percent bullshit.

54
00:05:38,163 --> 00:05:40,654
But it's entertaining. So I read it.

55
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:45,598
It entertains me. You won't let me
read it, so you entertain me.

56
00:05:45,837 --> 00:05:47,828
Tell me a story now. Go.

57
00:05:48,506 --> 00:05:51,407
-There was a DUI stop.
-A DUI stop?

58
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:53,235
Let me load up!

59
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:56,447
-A DUI? Oh, shit!
-Well, I--

60
00:05:56,681 --> 00:05:59,707
-Listen, we were on midwatch--
-We who?

61
00:05:59,951 --> 00:06:02,852
-Oh, me and Debbie.
-Who's Debbie?

62
00:06:03,855 --> 00:06:06,221
Debbie Maxwell, my training officer.

63
00:06:06,925 --> 00:06:09,655
-A female training officer?
-Yes, sir.

64
00:06:09,894 --> 00:06:13,057
Okay. All right.

65
00:06:13,298 --> 00:06:14,925
Was she black, white?

66
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,531
She was white.

67
00:06:17,735 --> 00:06:19,965
-Lick-her license?
-A what?

68
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:23,535
A lick-her license.
Was she a dyke, a lesbian?

69
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:27,039
-Is she any good?
-She's pretty good.

70
00:06:27,278 --> 00:06:29,644
-Okay, Debbie, midwatch. Go.
-Right.

71
00:06:29,881 --> 00:06:31,940
-It was a quiet night--
-Boom!

72
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:36,085
-What the fuck?
-You never know, that's the point. Go.

73
00:06:36,321 --> 00:06:38,812
It was quiet and we're rolling...

74
00:06:39,057 --> 00:06:42,584
...I'm driving. This Acura,
just a beautiful car...

75
00:06:42,827 --> 00:06:47,491
...comes out a side street, all over
the median. I hit the wailer.

76
00:06:47,732 --> 00:06:50,963
He drives for 10 blocks
before he pulls over.

77
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:54,069
Plates run clean,
so I test and arrest.

78
00:06:54,305 --> 00:06:57,570
I'm belting in our unit,
and she's tossing his car.

79
00:06:57,809 --> 00:07:02,542
She shows me a .38
and two loaded shotguns.

80
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,248
-No shit?
-No shit! So...

81
00:07:05,483 --> 00:07:09,317
...she calls and I'm searching.
I find 500 grams of meth.

82
00:07:09,587 --> 00:07:12,420
Turns out he's on bail
for distribution...

83
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:16,291
...on his way to smoke
his ex-partner before trial.

84
00:07:16,527 --> 00:07:17,516
Boom.

85
00:07:18,196 --> 00:07:21,290
-Prevented a murder.
-You got him. It's amazing.

86
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:24,466
It is. That you're out there...

87
00:07:24,702 --> 00:07:29,833
...with a fine bitch for a year and
the best story you can tell me...

88
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:31,769
...is a drunk stop.

89
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:39,509
But I don't believe you.
You tapped that ass, didn't you?

90
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:44,388
Tell the truth.
You know you tapped that ass.

91
00:07:44,622 --> 00:07:46,487
In the back, bam! Code X.

92
00:07:47,025 --> 00:07:49,459
-I got a wife.
-You got a dick.

93
00:07:51,362 --> 00:07:53,330
-You do have one, don't you?
-Yes.

94
00:07:53,564 --> 00:07:58,001
Your dick lines up straight.
Right and left of it are pockets.

95
00:07:58,236 --> 00:08:02,400
In those pockets are money.
Look in either one. Pay the bill.

96
00:08:11,716 --> 00:08:14,617
Grab that menu off that window for me.

97
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,351
Get in, it's unlocked.

98
00:08:28,933 --> 00:08:31,265
Throw that in the glove box.

99
00:08:31,502 --> 00:08:35,370
-This is not from the motor pool.
-No. Sexy, though, huh?

100
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:40,704
-Where's the office, at division?
-You're in the office.

101
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:44,607
Going up.

102
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,437
Today is a training day.

103
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:14,810
Give you a taste of the business.

104
00:09:15,246 --> 00:09:17,578
I got 38 cases pending trial...

105
00:09:17,815 --> 00:09:21,046
...63 active investigations,
250 I can't clear.

106
00:09:21,486 --> 00:09:24,455
I supervise five officers.
Five personalities.

107
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:27,385
Five sets of problems.
You could be six.

108
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:29,957
I ain't holding no hands.

109
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:33,163
You got today to show me
what you're made of.

110
00:09:33,664 --> 00:09:37,430
You don't like Narcotics,
get the fuck out of my car...

111
00:09:37,668 --> 00:09:40,796
...get a job chasing bad checks.
You hear me?

112
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:42,505
-I hear you.
-Okay.

113
00:09:45,443 --> 00:09:47,172
Why do you want to be a narc?

114
00:09:47,478 --> 00:09:51,915
To serve my community by ridding
it of dangerous drugs.

115
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,947
Right, but why a narc?

116
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,082
I want to make detective.

117
00:09:58,322 --> 00:10:00,187
Stick with me, you can do it.

118
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,855
Unlearn that academy shit.

119
00:10:03,094 --> 00:10:05,927
Don't bring that here.
It'll get you killed.

120
00:10:06,164 --> 00:10:08,462
I'll do anything you want me to do.

121
00:10:11,602 --> 00:10:13,229
My nigger.

122
00:10:13,671 --> 00:10:16,139
Roll your window down. Start there.

123
00:10:18,176 --> 00:10:21,942
-Got to hear it, smell it, taste it.
-Right.

124
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,408
<i>How's your Espa¨¾o>.</i>

125
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,144
Learn that shit.

126
00:10:27,985 --> 00:10:29,612
That will get you killed.

127
00:10:29,854 --> 00:10:32,914
They plot all kinds of shit
behind your back.

128
00:10:33,391 --> 00:10:37,555
You gonna teach me that
old-school Rodney King shit?

129
00:10:37,795 --> 00:10:40,457
We don't roll like that no more.

130
00:10:40,698 --> 00:10:41,960
Now we use this.

131
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,293
These niggers are too strong.

132
00:10:44,535 --> 00:10:47,766
-Think I'm crazy?
-I don't know what to think.

133
00:10:48,005 --> 00:10:49,632
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

134
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:51,434
Good.

135
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,147
Good.

136
00:11:07,225 --> 00:11:08,556
Been married long?

137
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,522
-About a year.
-Yeah?

138
00:11:10,761 --> 00:11:13,559
-You got a kid?
-A girl, 9 months.

139
00:11:14,365 --> 00:11:17,459
I got four. Boys.

140
00:11:17,702 --> 00:11:21,035
You need a son,
I'll hook your lady up. Can't miss.

141
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:26,402
Can we not talk
about my family, all right?

142
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:27,611
I respect that.

143
00:11:28,446 --> 00:11:31,108
I'm married, I got my queen too.

144
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,810
I remember having a young bride.

145
00:11:34,051 --> 00:11:37,282
You probably fuck her face-to-face,
don't you?

146
00:11:37,522 --> 00:11:39,149
Let's not talk about her.

147
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:43,121
That's my point. You're so in love,
it's coming right out.

148
00:11:43,594 --> 00:11:46,256
The day you bring
that here is the day...

149
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:50,194
...you don't make it back.
Hide it deep inside of you.

150
00:11:50,434 --> 00:11:52,766
The maggots out here
will find it...

151
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:55,632
...use it against you
and chew you up.

152
00:11:55,873 --> 00:11:58,103
Never wear the ring to work.

153
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,740
-I'm serious about that.
-Thanks.

154
00:12:33,511 --> 00:12:34,876
What's here?

155
00:12:37,181 --> 00:12:38,341
Transactions.

156
00:12:39,684 --> 00:12:44,314
You see that guy trying to act
like he's not slanging dope?

157
00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:47,581
-Yeah.
-That's my boy.

158
00:12:47,825 --> 00:12:50,293
That's my boy, Neto.

159
00:12:51,028 --> 00:12:52,791
Only 1 7, but he can kill.

160
00:12:53,497 --> 00:12:55,590
-Works for me.
-He's an informer?

161
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:57,926
Teammate. I got eyes everywhere.

162
00:12:58,169 --> 00:13:03,300
He gets to make some cash.
Lets me know when big things happen.

163
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:05,372
Big transactions.

164
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,312
-You trust him?
-Damn right I do.

165
00:13:11,549 --> 00:13:15,952
Sprung his mom from INS detention.
Here we go. Watch this.

166
00:13:18,189 --> 00:13:22,683
That's right. Come on down.

167
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:26,124
Come on. Look at it. Sexy, ain't it?

168
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,031
That's right.

169
00:13:30,468 --> 00:13:32,698
-See the hand-to-hand?
-I saw it.

170
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:36,134
-When was your last felony stop?
-Two weeks ago.

171
00:13:36,374 --> 00:13:37,500
You need practice.

172
00:13:37,742 --> 00:13:41,007
-College kids.
-They'll get an education today.

173
00:13:41,245 --> 00:13:44,305
I want them grabbing glass.
You take the back.

174
00:13:44,548 --> 00:13:47,312
Stay off of the Rover.

175
00:13:47,551 --> 00:13:48,984
Let's go.

176
00:13:53,224 --> 00:13:56,318
-You little fuckers.
-Run, baby, run.

177
00:14:09,774 --> 00:14:12,072
Police! Let's see your hands!

178
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,038
Put them up! Put them up!

179
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:16,746
Put your hands on the windshield!

180
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:21,577
-Put your hands on the glass.
-Driver, put it in park!

181
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:25,949
-It's a stick shift!
-Throw the keys out the window!

182
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:28,484
Put your hands on your chest!

183
00:14:30,428 --> 00:14:32,658
All right, fork it over.

184
00:14:32,897 --> 00:14:34,023
-What?
-You know.

185
00:14:34,265 --> 00:14:36,859
The marijuana. Give it to me!

186
00:14:37,101 --> 00:14:39,228
-Give it!
-Okay! Sorry, sir.

187
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:44,203
-Shut up! Give me that pipe.
-My mom gave me that pipe.

188
00:14:44,442 --> 00:14:48,776
She can pick it up in jail.
Give me the cigarettes too.

189
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:52,312
-Control your suspect!
-Palms on the glass!

190
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:57,613
Move the hands, I'll slap you!
Face against the glass! Right there!

191
00:14:59,323 --> 00:15:01,814
You know this is a gang neighborhood?

192
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:05,859
-Yeah!
-Then don't come down here.

193
00:15:06,097 --> 00:15:10,796
I see you down here again,
I'll make you walk home.

194
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:15,165
I'll let the homeboys run
a train on her. Know what that is?

195
00:15:15,573 --> 00:15:17,598
Yes, sir.

196
00:15:17,842 --> 00:15:22,438
All right, gentlemen.
Thanks for your cooperation.

197
00:15:23,247 --> 00:15:26,148
Let's go. Safe your iron, son.

198
00:15:27,918 --> 00:15:29,112
Shit!

199
00:15:39,864 --> 00:15:41,422
I like that shit.

200
00:15:41,665 --> 00:15:44,725
I like how you move.
You were trained well.

201
00:15:44,969 --> 00:15:49,906
Check that out. It's a bad dime.
See the hairs, undeveloped seeds.

202
00:15:50,141 --> 00:15:52,041
You see how immature it is.

203
00:15:52,276 --> 00:15:54,676
That's classic Mexican garbage.

204
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:57,813
Let me see. It's old.
Probably last year's.

205
00:15:58,516 --> 00:15:59,642
To be truly effective...

206
00:15:59,884 --> 00:16:04,947
...a good narcotics agent
must know and love narcotics.

207
00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:07,817
A good narcotics agent should have...

208
00:16:08,058 --> 00:16:10,151
...narcotics in his blood.

209
00:16:11,662 --> 00:16:14,460
-What, you gonna smoke that?
-No, you are.

210
00:16:16,367 --> 00:16:18,301
-Hell if I am!
-Yes.

211
00:16:18,803 --> 00:16:20,236
-You're not?
-No.

212
00:16:20,471 --> 00:16:23,133
-Why? You a Mormon?
-I'm not losing my job.

213
00:16:23,374 --> 00:16:24,568
This is your job.

214
00:16:24,809 --> 00:16:26,299
-Smoke it.
-No.

215
00:16:26,544 --> 00:16:28,535
This ain't a test. Take a hit.

216
00:16:29,847 --> 00:16:33,647
Listen, I became a cop
to stop people from using--

217
00:16:35,052 --> 00:16:38,351
-That ain't cocaine. Take a hit.
-No, man.

218
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:44,753
-Jesus Christ!
-Yeah, right.

219
00:16:45,496 --> 00:16:47,726
If I was a dealer, you'd be dead!

220
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:51,526
Turn shit down out here,
and your wife gets a flag.

221
00:16:51,769 --> 00:16:53,202
What's wrong with you?

222
00:16:54,939 --> 00:16:56,031
You know what?

223
00:16:56,273 --> 00:17:01,336
I don't want you in my unit.
Get the fuck out of my car, rookie.

224
00:17:03,447 --> 00:17:04,414
Poo butt-ass.

225
00:17:08,285 --> 00:17:11,846
-What's the holdup?
-Move it!

226
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:13,522
Give me that thing.

227
00:17:14,358 --> 00:17:16,485
I'll smoke it. Give it to me.

228
00:17:18,896 --> 00:17:20,761
You want me to, I'll smoke it.

229
00:17:33,244 --> 00:17:37,340
Virgin lungs. Man up now.
Man up, nigger. Man up.

230
00:17:37,781 --> 00:17:38,907
Go ahead. Get it.

231
00:17:39,149 --> 00:17:42,641
-Come on!
-Shut the fuck up and just wait!

232
00:17:50,661 --> 00:17:53,926
-Man the fuck up! Finish that shit!
-Geronimo.

233
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:01,061
Let's go, nigger. Let's go.

234
00:18:52,356 --> 00:18:55,621
Oh, shit!

235
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:08,405
You okay, kid?

236
00:19:08,639 --> 00:19:13,406
That's a man size hit you took.
When's the last time you smoked weed?

237
00:19:15,012 --> 00:19:17,037
The last-- Twelfth grade.

238
00:19:17,481 --> 00:19:19,039
We were....

239
00:19:20,384 --> 00:19:22,909
-Well, we were....
-Smoking weed.

240
00:19:23,153 --> 00:19:24,620
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

241
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:29,950
Left that out of your service jacket.

242
00:19:30,194 --> 00:19:33,357
I know you got secrets.
Everybody got secrets.

243
00:19:33,597 --> 00:19:37,658
-Didn't know you liked it wet, though.
-What's wet?

244
00:19:37,901 --> 00:19:42,998
Butt-naked. Ill. Sherm. Dust.

245
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,973
PCP. Primos. P-dog.

246
00:19:48,545 --> 00:19:50,274
That's what you had.

247
00:19:51,081 --> 00:19:52,912
You couldn't taste it?

248
00:19:55,285 --> 00:19:58,550
-I never done it.
-I haven't, but you have now.

249
00:20:04,928 --> 00:20:06,486
Shit!

250
00:20:06,964 --> 00:20:10,092
Shit. I'll get piss-tested,
and I'll get fired.

251
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:13,303
The boss has our back.
We know before we piss.

252
00:20:15,639 --> 00:20:17,937
-Shit!
-Boom!

253
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,608
Why did you do this?

254
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:22,539
You're an adult.
Nobody made you smoke.

255
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,778
You made a decision. Live with it.

256
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:29,782
Not like I put a gun to your head.

257
00:20:34,925 --> 00:20:35,983
Man....

258
00:20:50,174 --> 00:20:54,270
-Oh, man, shit.
-Come on, get your shit together now.

259
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,907
This is my dog's house.

260
00:20:57,147 --> 00:20:59,411
We'll see what he thinks of you.

261
00:21:10,794 --> 00:21:14,161
-Get your ass in here!
-Roger, what's up?

262
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,958
-How are they treating you?
-All right.

263
00:21:17,201 --> 00:21:20,034
-I didn't wake you up?
-I never sleep.

264
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:22,397
Right. This my new guy, Jake.

265
00:21:22,639 --> 00:21:24,197
Come on. Get in here.

266
00:21:24,441 --> 00:21:27,968
Yeah. Time to get my swerve on here!

267
00:21:28,212 --> 00:21:30,544
-What you drinking?
-The best.

268
00:21:30,781 --> 00:21:33,648
The best, I know. Best for the best.

269
00:21:34,218 --> 00:21:37,881
I heard about Vegas.
Got a green light on your ass.

270
00:21:38,122 --> 00:21:39,612
No problem.

271
00:21:39,857 --> 00:21:42,348
Russians want you. I got your back.

272
00:21:42,693 --> 00:21:44,752
I know that. Thank you.

273
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:50,598
Here. Get that medicine up in you.

274
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:55,998
-Back to the world.
-Back to the world.

275
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:03,209
Went and got yourself
a daisy-fresh rookie.

276
00:22:10,487 --> 00:22:14,617
He's high as a motherfucker.
What did you give him?

277
00:22:14,858 --> 00:22:17,383
-A little of Mexico's finest.
-Yeah.

278
00:22:22,499 --> 00:22:23,898
Garbage.

279
00:22:24,668 --> 00:22:27,262
-Where'd you grow up?
-North Hollywood.

280
00:22:27,504 --> 00:22:29,438
-What's your last name?
-Hoyt.

281
00:22:29,673 --> 00:22:33,734
Hoyt. Hoyt....

282
00:22:34,845 --> 00:22:38,042
-Strong safety, North Hollywood High.
-Right.

283
00:22:39,216 --> 00:22:41,616
-How'd you know that?
-How did you?

284
00:22:42,219 --> 00:22:45,882
-I follow all the good players.
-No doubt.

285
00:22:46,123 --> 00:22:48,785
Excuse me. Shit.

286
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,418
-Strong safety, huh?
-It's me. What's up?

287
00:22:54,531 --> 00:22:58,865
I can't do anything.
Clean up your own mess. Don't call me.

288
00:22:59,736 --> 00:23:04,139
Hey! Here's a joke, boy.

289
00:23:04,775 --> 00:23:09,906
Man walks out of his house,
sees this snail lying on his porch.

290
00:23:10,147 --> 00:23:13,981
So he picks it up,
chucks it into the backyard.

291
00:23:14,218 --> 00:23:18,655
Snail bounces off a rock,
busts its shell up all to shit...

292
00:23:18,889 --> 00:23:20,584
...lands in the grass.

293
00:23:20,824 --> 00:23:24,089
Snail lies there dying.

294
00:23:26,163 --> 00:23:27,221
But...

295
00:23:27,464 --> 00:23:30,661
...snail doesn't die.
Soon it can crawl again.

296
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:33,560
And one day...

297
00:23:35,339 --> 00:23:38,604
...snail heads back
to the front of the house.

298
00:23:38,842 --> 00:23:42,869
Finally, after about a year...

299
00:23:43,113 --> 00:23:46,173
...the little guy crawls
back on the porch.

300
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:49,510
Right then the man walks
out of his house...

301
00:23:50,153 --> 00:23:51,882
...sees this snail again.

302
00:23:52,122 --> 00:23:53,589
So he looks at it...

303
00:23:53,857 --> 00:23:55,654
...and he says:

304
00:23:58,095 --> 00:24:00,120
"The fuck's your problem?"

305
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,595
That's not funny.

306
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:11,034
What you laughing for then?

307
00:24:11,275 --> 00:24:14,676
-I don't know, man. I--
-Hey!

308
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:18,540
Figure that joke out,
you'll figure the streets out.

309
00:24:19,516 --> 00:24:23,043
Nothing to figure out.
It's senseless bullshit.

310
00:24:23,287 --> 00:24:27,656
-You know-- I already figured it out.
-Really?

311
00:24:27,891 --> 00:24:31,452
-Yeah.
-You already figured the streets out?

312
00:24:31,728 --> 00:24:35,494
Well, it's all about smiles and cries.

313
00:24:36,133 --> 00:24:39,159
-Put the drink down. What is that?
-Hold on!

314
00:24:39,403 --> 00:24:41,064
Hold on. Smiles and cries.

315
00:24:41,338 --> 00:24:44,796
Smiles and cries.
Smiles and cries. I hear you.

316
00:24:45,475 --> 00:24:49,434
Yeah, you gotta control
your smiles and cries...

317
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:53,844
...because that's all you have,
and nobody can take that away.

318
00:24:56,219 --> 00:24:58,153
Oh, shit.

319
00:25:02,993 --> 00:25:08,158
What you think, dog? Think this
greenhorn can handle undercover?

320
00:25:09,333 --> 00:25:14,066
You were just like him.
Same silly-ass look and everything.

321
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:16,169
Saving the goddamn world.

322
00:25:17,207 --> 00:25:20,836
Now that's some smiles
and cries for your ass!

323
00:25:21,078 --> 00:25:23,774
-That was you.
-Shit lasted a week.

324
00:25:24,614 --> 00:25:25,945
Gotta get back to it.

325
00:25:26,516 --> 00:25:27,881
Thanks for the snort.

326
00:25:28,118 --> 00:25:29,551
-Good to see you.
-Yeah.

327
00:25:29,786 --> 00:25:31,879
Yes, sir. What you doing later?

328
00:25:32,122 --> 00:25:34,056
Stay home. Save some cheddar.

329
00:25:34,291 --> 00:25:39,194
My dream's less than a year away.
Philippine Islands, here I come.

330
00:25:39,429 --> 00:25:41,420
-Let me go too.
-You're invited.

331
00:25:57,147 --> 00:26:02,346
Hey. Open your eyes, man.
You'll feel a lot better.

332
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:09,816
Boom! Come on, man. Sit your ass up.

333
00:26:16,266 --> 00:26:17,233
Who are you?

334
00:26:19,803 --> 00:26:22,328
I'm the Zig-Zag man. Who are you?

335
00:26:22,572 --> 00:26:25,666
-I'm a cop. Watch out!
-Don't shoot nobody.

336
00:26:25,909 --> 00:26:28,343
Get that beer in you for ballast.

337
00:26:28,945 --> 00:26:32,278
-No, man.
-Get it in you. You'll feel better.

338
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,024
Stop the car!

339
00:26:51,268 --> 00:26:53,236
Stop the car! I saw something!

340
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:54,869
-Just relax.
-Stop!

341
00:26:55,105 --> 00:26:58,006
All right! Hold the fuck on-- Hey!

342
00:27:04,681 --> 00:27:06,945
Fuck me, man! Shit.

343
00:27:09,386 --> 00:27:12,150
Police officer!
Get away from the girl!

344
00:27:12,389 --> 00:27:15,256
-I'm gonna fuck you too, cop!
-Get the--

345
00:27:49,025 --> 00:27:51,585
We didn't do shit! Bitch is crazy!

346
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:58,563
Roll over, man. Roll the fuck over!

347
00:27:59,336 --> 00:28:00,530
Fucking ass prick!

348
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:06,366
My nigger!

349
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:09,443
Go ahead, cowboy,
you got mad squabbles.

350
00:28:10,547 --> 00:28:13,744
-Thanks for the help.
-You should've shot them.

351
00:28:14,084 --> 00:28:15,244
What's happening?

352
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,851
-You're dead!
-Okay! Wait! Hold it!

353
00:28:18,088 --> 00:28:19,988
-You too, white boy!
-Okay....

354
00:28:20,223 --> 00:28:23,454
-My cousins will blast you fools!
-Calm down.

355
00:28:23,693 --> 00:28:25,991
-Calm down. You okay?
-No, I'm not!

356
00:28:26,229 --> 00:28:28,220
-Look at my nose!
-I see it.

357
00:28:28,465 --> 00:28:32,231
Put ice on it. You'll be fine.
What're you doing here?

358
00:28:32,469 --> 00:28:34,960
-I was just--
-They probably got AIDS.

359
00:28:35,205 --> 00:28:36,729
Why you not at school?

360
00:28:36,973 --> 00:28:39,203
I was going to a ditch party and--

361
00:28:39,442 --> 00:28:41,910
You almost became the ditch party.

362
00:28:42,145 --> 00:28:44,739
<i>-Where your cousins from?
-Hillside Trece!</i>

363
00:28:44,981 --> 00:28:48,678
-Remember that!
-Tell your cousins to get your back.

364
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:51,114
Grab your bag and go home now.

365
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:54,687
-No! I need a statement--
-Don't need no statement.

366
00:28:54,925 --> 00:28:58,053
-They'll fuck you up.
-We gonna let them go?

367
00:28:58,295 --> 00:29:00,661
You wanna beat them up, go ahead.

368
00:29:00,897 --> 00:29:04,890
I got a punching bag at home.
They should be off the streets.

369
00:29:05,635 --> 00:29:06,761
You hear that?

370
00:29:07,604 --> 00:29:10,732
-Wanna go home or to jail?
-What you think?

371
00:29:12,776 --> 00:29:15,802
Got room at the booty house.
You been there?

372
00:29:17,781 --> 00:29:20,443
-You'll grab your ankles.
-Suck my dick!

373
00:29:20,684 --> 00:29:23,653
-I know people.
-That's how it starts.

374
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:26,185
What about you? What you got?

375
00:29:26,423 --> 00:29:27,947
-Got nothing?
-No.

376
00:29:28,191 --> 00:29:29,522
-You sure?
-Yeah.

377
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:32,922
-Where's your horn?
-Got none.

378
00:29:35,999 --> 00:29:37,762
You got money, though.

379
00:29:38,001 --> 00:29:41,664
You lied to me!

380
00:29:42,772 --> 00:29:44,967
Lucky I don't make you eat that.

381
00:29:45,709 --> 00:29:49,839
Stand up, you. Stand the fuck up!

382
00:29:55,685 --> 00:29:57,880
Yeah. Oh, shit, huh?

383
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:08,754
Turn around, sucker. Turn around.

384
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:12,333
So you like raping girls?

385
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:16,029
-Like to rape girls?
-No, man.

386
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:18,365
-That's what you like?
-No....

387
00:30:19,976 --> 00:30:22,001
That what you like? Don't lie.

388
00:30:22,245 --> 00:30:25,703
Told me to suck your dick.
Is that what you said?

389
00:30:27,517 --> 00:30:28,643
Look at me.

390
00:30:29,719 --> 00:30:32,688
You wanted me
to suck your dick, right?

391
00:30:32,922 --> 00:30:35,117
Isn't that what you said?

392
00:30:35,358 --> 00:30:38,657
Didn't you say suck it?
Don't lie. Am I a liar?

393
00:30:38,895 --> 00:30:40,226
You didn't say that?

394
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:44,024
That's not what you said?
So I'm lying?

395
00:30:44,267 --> 00:30:47,498
-No, please!
-Where is it? I can't find it.

396
00:30:48,338 --> 00:30:50,033
Pull your pants down.

397
00:30:53,743 --> 00:30:56,940
Which nut you want?
I'll leave you one.

398
00:30:57,847 --> 00:31:01,146
Your choice. Just make a decision.

399
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:05,481
All right.
Put your hands on your head.

400
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:11,283
Close your eyes. Close your eyes.

401
00:31:15,965 --> 00:31:17,728
Lucky I got other business.

402
00:31:17,967 --> 00:31:23,462
I'd cut your fucking dick off
and stick it up your funky ass. Bitch.

403
00:31:23,707 --> 00:31:27,700
Damn! I'm thirsty.
I want a beer. What about you?

404
00:31:28,078 --> 00:31:29,602
You want a beer?

405
00:31:33,783 --> 00:31:36,081
I'm gonna leave you three to it.

406
00:31:42,325 --> 00:31:44,156
Pussy-ass bitch!

407
00:31:44,394 --> 00:31:47,124
I see you again, I'll fuck you up!

408
00:31:47,897 --> 00:31:49,762
You won't see shit coming!

409
00:31:49,999 --> 00:31:53,491
I'll dent your mouth,
I'll crack your head open.

410
00:31:53,737 --> 00:31:55,364
You fucking pig! Come on!

411
00:32:07,283 --> 00:32:10,081
-That girl's 1 4.
-She all woman, though.

412
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,949
You tax that ass for days, man!
Keep walking, bitch!

413
00:32:25,201 --> 00:32:26,361
You want a beer?

414
00:32:27,771 --> 00:32:31,400
-No, I don't want a beer, man.
-No? You mad?

415
00:32:43,853 --> 00:32:45,787
Want to book that $60, huh?

416
00:32:46,022 --> 00:32:48,684
Here, go ahead, book it into evidence.

417
00:32:49,192 --> 00:32:51,387
Where the suspects? Go get them.

418
00:32:51,628 --> 00:32:53,323
You let them go.

419
00:32:53,563 --> 00:32:55,155
-I let them go?
-You did.

420
00:32:55,398 --> 00:32:58,526
You want to run and gun,
stay in Patrol.

421
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:00,633
This is Investigations.

422
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:02,667
Garbage men handle garbage.

423
00:33:02,906 --> 00:33:05,636
Professional anglers
go after the big fish.

424
00:33:05,875 --> 00:33:08,366
Chasing them crackhead
motherfuckers....

425
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:11,205
-They'd have killed you.
-They belong in jail.

426
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:14,041
Why? They got beaten,
lost their money.

427
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:17,683
<i>Hillside's ¨¦ses will smoke them.
What more you want?</i>

428
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:19,854
-I want justice.
-That's not justice?

429
00:33:20,356 --> 00:33:22,051
-That's street justice.
-So?

430
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:24,590
-Let them kill each other?
-God willing.

431
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:27,191
Fuck them!
Everybody looking like them.

432
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:29,421
Reality is, the good guys...

433
00:33:29,666 --> 00:33:32,829
...they die first.
The school kids and moms...

434
00:33:33,069 --> 00:33:36,436
...family men, don't want to catch
any bullets.

435
00:33:36,673 --> 00:33:40,200
To protect the sheep,
you got to catch the wolf.

436
00:33:40,443 --> 00:33:43,310
It takes a wolf to catch a wolf,
understand?

437
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:44,547
What?

438
00:33:44,781 --> 00:33:47,807
-Protect the sheep by killing wolves.
-I heard you.

439
00:33:48,051 --> 00:33:50,781
-You didn't hear me.
-All right. Whatever.

440
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,783
Whatever the fuck-ever!

441
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:09,366
Do you ever lock anybody up?
You seem busy keeping people out.

442
00:34:09,606 --> 00:34:11,267
You don't know shit!

443
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:14,908
Shit, they build jails because of me!

444
00:34:15,311 --> 00:34:19,407
Judges gave over 1 5,000 man-years
of incarceration time...

445
00:34:19,649 --> 00:34:23,141
...based on my cases.
My record speaks for itself.

446
00:34:23,386 --> 00:34:25,286
How many felons have you got?

447
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:28,820
I rest my case.

448
00:34:34,397 --> 00:34:39,528
-I'm not smoking crack, all right?
-I'm glad. Put it in the glove box.

449
00:34:40,069 --> 00:34:41,934
Put the $60 in there too.

450
00:34:42,171 --> 00:34:46,437
That'll come in handy.
We'll use it like a credit card.

451
00:34:55,251 --> 00:34:58,482
No matter what I say,
you did the right thing.

452
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:04,792
Reminds me when I was
chasing down bad guys.

453
00:35:05,028 --> 00:35:07,656
Pretty amazing shit you did
back there.

454
00:35:09,699 --> 00:35:10,927
Thanks.

455
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:15,025
I noticed you applied that chokehold
though, huh?

456
00:35:16,139 --> 00:35:17,868
That's a no-no procedure.

457
00:35:19,776 --> 00:35:23,576
-I was getting my ass kicked.
-You did what you had to do.

458
00:35:23,813 --> 00:35:26,441
You did what you had to do.

459
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:29,147
That's right.

460
00:35:32,622 --> 00:35:35,056
What a wolf does. You a wolf?

461
00:35:36,192 --> 00:35:39,025
Come on, wolf! Come on, dog!

462
00:35:42,065 --> 00:35:45,125
No, I said a wolf,
not a rooster, a wolf.

463
00:35:49,238 --> 00:35:52,571
-That's a rooster, give me a wolf!
-Give me a beer!

464
00:35:52,809 --> 00:35:54,970
There you go! That's my nigga.

465
00:35:56,646 --> 00:35:58,637
You got the magic eye, Hoyt.

466
00:35:58,915 --> 00:36:01,907
You have the magic eye.

467
00:36:02,318 --> 00:36:04,115
You up your street IQ...

468
00:36:04,354 --> 00:36:06,948
...you'll do some damage,
I guarantee.

469
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,092
Crime fighter.

470
00:36:53,102 --> 00:36:54,763
-What you need?
-Crack.

471
00:36:55,938 --> 00:36:57,838
-Uh, 20 bucks....
-Crack?

472
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:04,312
Smell like bacon!
Do I look like a sucker to you, nigga?

473
00:37:05,314 --> 00:37:06,906
Fuck you, rookie!

474
00:37:12,288 --> 00:37:13,346
Go fetch, dog.

475
00:37:13,589 --> 00:37:15,181
You want me to....

476
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:20,095
Oh, come on, man, it's....

477
00:37:26,502 --> 00:37:28,800
Give me a break! Hey, you! Slow up!

478
00:37:34,243 --> 00:37:35,369
Come on, stop!

479
00:37:35,611 --> 00:37:39,274
Police officer! Police officer! Stop!
Come on, man!

480
00:37:39,515 --> 00:37:41,005
Give me a break! Shit!

481
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:45,311
Get out! Get out of here
or I call police.

482
00:37:46,456 --> 00:37:50,324
Police officer, ma'am, calm down.
I said stop! Stop!

483
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,653
Get the fuck off me. Fuck off.

484
00:37:58,634 --> 00:38:02,001
You're making this so much harder!
Just calm down!

485
00:38:08,778 --> 00:38:10,678
You love this shit, huh?

486
00:38:11,547 --> 00:38:13,412
Hey, man, hey!

487
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:15,139
Pick him up!

488
00:38:15,384 --> 00:38:18,581
Civil rights violating motherfuckers!

489
00:38:18,821 --> 00:38:19,788
Fuck!

490
00:38:20,656 --> 00:38:23,955
-Watch the fucking legs, man!
-Pick his legs up.

491
00:38:24,193 --> 00:38:28,186
Ain't got nothing better to do
than fuck with me, man? Shit!

492
00:38:31,634 --> 00:38:33,067
Who you working for?

493
00:38:33,302 --> 00:38:36,066
I ain't work for nobody!
I'm on disability!

494
00:38:36,305 --> 00:38:38,205
Shit! You know you cracking.

495
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,204
I don't sell no more.

496
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:42,709
-No rocks?
-No rocks.

497
00:38:43,579 --> 00:38:45,809
-But I found this.
-No, you don't.

498
00:38:46,048 --> 00:38:49,245
That motherfucker planted
that shit on me.

499
00:38:49,485 --> 00:38:52,648
Put me in the front seat,
I'll whup his ass!

500
00:38:55,158 --> 00:38:56,489
Who you working for?

501
00:38:56,726 --> 00:39:00,457
Told you I don't work for nobody, man!

502
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,097
Where the rocks?

503
00:39:02,565 --> 00:39:04,863
I got nothing on me.
I gave it up.

504
00:39:08,738 --> 00:39:09,705
Where the rocks?

505
00:39:11,741 --> 00:39:12,901
Open your mouth.

506
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:14,606
You a doctor now?

507
00:39:14,844 --> 00:39:16,368
A dentist. Open it.

508
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:18,911
Lift up your tongue.

509
00:39:20,516 --> 00:39:24,077
Your partner already searched me.
I'm straight.

510
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,878
Yeah, okay.

511
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:28,419
You got a pen, got a writing pen?

512
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:32,027
Didn't see the motherfucker coming!

513
00:39:33,763 --> 00:39:35,025
Nothing in there?

514
00:39:37,967 --> 00:39:39,332
Nothing, man!

515
00:39:39,569 --> 00:39:41,161
Ain't got nothing, huh?

516
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,573
God!

517
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:48,439
-Damn!
-Now what is that?

518
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:51,374
-Crack, man!
-Right. Jimmy crack corn.

519
00:39:51,614 --> 00:39:53,809
One, two, three, four, five, six.

520
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:56,484
Oh, you federally fucked now.

521
00:39:56,986 --> 00:39:59,750
You got crack and a gun.

522
00:39:59,989 --> 00:40:03,720
With your record you'll get
10 years per bullet, you know?

523
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,427
Give me a name, now.

524
00:40:06,229 --> 00:40:09,392
-You know I ain't no snitch!
-I know you ain't.

525
00:40:10,433 --> 00:40:11,457
Give me a name.

526
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:14,230
-Twenty. A name!
-Fuck!

527
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:17,233
That's 30 years!

528
00:40:17,573 --> 00:40:19,871
You want to go to jail or go home?

529
00:40:20,977 --> 00:40:22,410
-He in County.
-Who?

530
00:40:23,246 --> 00:40:26,909
This nigga named Sandman.
That's all I know! Shit!

531
00:40:27,149 --> 00:40:28,173
Sandman?

532
00:40:29,151 --> 00:40:30,641
See how easy it was?

533
00:40:34,423 --> 00:40:37,017
-Unhook him.
-Sick of this shit, man!

534
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,750
Want the evidence?

535
00:40:38,995 --> 00:40:41,088
-Fuck that, man.
-My nigga.

536
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:57,507
<i>-It's Bob.
-Hello.</i>

537
00:40:57,747 --> 00:40:59,339
<i>-How's it going?
-It's Alonzo.</i>

538
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,209
<i>-Got your gang book?
-Why?</i>

539
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:05,409
I need a res on a Sandman.
He may be in custody.

540
00:41:05,655 --> 00:41:07,885
<i>-Hold on. I'll check.
-No problem.</i>

541
00:41:08,124 --> 00:41:11,116
That doesn't fly anymore.
Shoving a pen down.

542
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,692
-What if he complains?
-To who?

543
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:18,491
<i>23130, 1 13th Street.
Kevin Miller, a.k.a. Sandman. Got it?</i>

544
00:41:18,734 --> 00:41:20,292
I know where it is.

545
00:41:20,536 --> 00:41:24,028
<i>-Out there by Imperial Courts?
-Exactly, uh-huh.</i>

546
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:26,070
<i>-Thanks a lot.
-No problem.</i>

547
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:31,542
-We go after Sandman?
-We go after him.

548
00:42:20,096 --> 00:42:21,563
Opening a Circuit City?

549
00:42:21,797 --> 00:42:24,197
No, unclaimed shit from Property.

550
00:42:24,433 --> 00:42:27,561
Hand it out to my CI's, witnesses,
victims.

551
00:42:27,803 --> 00:42:30,897
Try to help out their families.
Put this on.

552
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:33,941
Come on, let's go.

553
00:42:34,477 --> 00:42:39,779
Intel says she lives here alone.
She got two female juveniles...

554
00:42:40,015 --> 00:42:41,710
...possibly a male juvenile.

555
00:42:41,951 --> 00:42:45,352
-If he's not here, why are we?
-To serve this warrant.

556
00:42:45,621 --> 00:42:49,182
-We can't do that.
-Yes, we can. We the police.

557
00:42:49,425 --> 00:42:51,757
-Why not get a real warrant?
-We trying to get shit done.

558
00:42:51,994 --> 00:42:54,724
Stand over there
and don't get me killed.

559
00:42:57,967 --> 00:43:01,232
-Police, we got a search warrant!
-L.A.P.D., open up!

560
00:43:02,571 --> 00:43:04,402
Kevin ain't here!

561
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,904
Just open the door!

562
00:43:07,143 --> 00:43:08,633
Kevin ain't here!

563
00:43:08,878 --> 00:43:12,109
-Open the door, ma'am!
-He ain't even here!

564
00:43:12,948 --> 00:43:15,314
I said Kevin ain't even over here!

565
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:17,746
We got a search warrant.
Open up.

566
00:43:18,487 --> 00:43:19,920
Ain't nobody here!

567
00:43:20,456 --> 00:43:23,084
Get your big ass down!
Right down! Down!

568
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:26,157
Don't move, spread them out!
Don't move!

569
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:29,421
Anybody in the house?
Is anybody in the house?!

570
00:43:29,665 --> 00:43:32,429
My nephew, Dimitri! In the bedroom!

571
00:43:32,668 --> 00:43:36,695
Okay. I'm gonna clear the house,
check it for weapons.

572
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:47,480
Kitchen's clear!

573
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,354
-Dimitri?
-Yeah?

574
00:44:00,062 --> 00:44:02,030
Put your hands up, son.

575
00:44:02,731 --> 00:44:04,130
-Anybody else?
-No.

576
00:44:04,366 --> 00:44:06,027
-You sure?
-Yeah.

577
00:44:06,802 --> 00:44:10,704
Okay, just stay right there.
Don't move! Don't you move.

578
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:14,299
Stand up. Keep your hands
where I can see them.

579
00:44:14,543 --> 00:44:18,001
Sit down and place them
on your knees.

580
00:44:18,247 --> 00:44:20,374
Sit down. We're the good guys.

581
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:24,286
Just sit down right over there
next to your auntie.

582
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,782
Right over there.

583
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:28,848
House is Code-4.
I'm starting the search.

584
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:43,904
-I wanna see that warrant.
-The what?

585
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:45,868
The warrant. I need a copy.

586
00:44:46,108 --> 00:44:48,872
My partner has it.
He'll be out soon.

587
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,245
Where's your backup?

588
00:44:53,516 --> 00:44:57,247
Just be quiet until we're through
with our investigation.

589
00:44:57,486 --> 00:45:00,421
-You got the gun, don't you?
-That's right.

590
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:03,454
Punk-ass, bitch-ass, crooked-ass cop!

591
00:45:04,994 --> 00:45:06,086
You a rookie.

592
00:45:07,296 --> 00:45:09,025
Give me a break, okay?

593
00:45:14,770 --> 00:45:16,397
How you doing over there?

594
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:20,473
You cool? Come on.
Don't worry about it, you're cool.

595
00:45:23,646 --> 00:45:24,670
All right.

596
00:45:29,385 --> 00:45:33,116
-Ma'am, please sit down.
-You act like you pay the rent!

597
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:35,050
-Sit down!
-You all stink!

598
00:45:35,291 --> 00:45:37,816
You gotta get drunk to come
up here!

599
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:39,994
-Sit down now!
-Y'all stink!

600
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:42,387
You're gonna shoot me, boss?

601
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:48,297
Close your eyes.
This punk cop is gonna shoot me!

602
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:50,562
-Sit down, right now!
-Okay.

603
00:45:50,806 --> 00:45:52,467
Okay! Everything is fine.

604
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:54,433
We made a mistake.

605
00:45:55,911 --> 00:45:59,745
Didn't find a damn thing.
I'm very sorry.

606
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:02,513
Thanks for your cooperation.
Let's go.

607
00:46:02,818 --> 00:46:04,843
-Show me that warrant.
-What?

608
00:46:05,087 --> 00:46:07,920
I want to see that goddamn warrant!

609
00:46:11,193 --> 00:46:13,252
Here you go. Let's go!

610
00:46:17,766 --> 00:46:18,994
Shit!

611
00:46:22,471 --> 00:46:23,597
Motherfuckers!

612
00:46:24,139 --> 00:46:27,438
Hey, jackers! Give me my money back.

613
00:46:27,676 --> 00:46:30,736
You ain't no police!
Give me my money back!

614
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:35,246
Jackers, why you all standing
over there?! Blast them fools!

615
00:46:35,484 --> 00:46:38,180
You ain't no police!

616
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:40,445
I want my money back!

617
00:46:40,689 --> 00:46:42,316
Start, you motherfucker!

618
00:46:42,891 --> 00:46:44,119
Fuck! Gun!

619
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,954
-Just get out of here!
-Stay in the car!

620
00:46:51,734 --> 00:46:53,395
Yeah, motherfuckers!

621
00:47:15,557 --> 00:47:16,251
That was not cool, all right?
That was not cool at all!

622
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:21,622
Opening fire in a neighborhood.

623
00:47:21,864 --> 00:47:26,028
Where was the Sandman?
What were you doing back there?

624
00:47:26,268 --> 00:47:31,535
Checking for narcotics activity.
Drugs, guns, baggies, you know?

625
00:47:31,774 --> 00:47:34,174
-Yeah, cash!
-Speak on it, son.

626
00:47:34,443 --> 00:47:37,037
-She's screaming about money--
-Bullshit.

627
00:47:37,279 --> 00:47:39,804
She's screaming
about having us killed!

628
00:47:40,049 --> 00:47:45,009
I'll be on the 6:00 news
in handcuffs because of you.

629
00:47:45,254 --> 00:47:48,690
With the scandals,
it is open season on misconduct.

630
00:47:48,924 --> 00:47:51,620
-They'll nail us to the wall.
-Pull over.

631
00:47:52,594 --> 00:47:54,186
-Pull over.
-Here?

632
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:56,261
-Yeah, pull over.
-Shit!

633
00:48:15,884 --> 00:48:16,851
What?

634
00:48:19,221 --> 00:48:20,188
Listen.

635
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:23,715
You're in a privileged position
to learn.

636
00:48:23,959 --> 00:48:26,018
Keep your mouth shut, eyes open.

637
00:48:26,261 --> 00:48:29,424
Want to do some good,
this is the place to learn.

638
00:48:29,798 --> 00:48:33,791
You can't take it, maybe you
should go back to your division.

639
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:38,439
Get a nice job lighting flares
or measuring car wrecks.

640
00:48:39,108 --> 00:48:42,600
You got to decide
whether you're a wolf...

641
00:48:43,846 --> 00:48:45,245
...or a sheep.

642
00:48:49,651 --> 00:48:52,279
Get your ink...

643
00:48:55,958 --> 00:48:57,721
...or go give him a hand.

644
00:49:28,323 --> 00:49:30,985
What are we doing here?
We'll get killed.

645
00:49:31,226 --> 00:49:34,787
-You know about this place?
-It's the Jungle, right?

646
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:38,124
They say don't come with anything
less than a platoon.

647
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:50,044
This is the heart of it.

648
00:49:50,546 --> 00:49:52,537
Jungle. Damu headquarters.

649
00:49:53,849 --> 00:49:55,248
Stoners.

650
00:49:55,484 --> 00:49:58,317
A lot of murder investigations
lead here.

651
00:49:58,687 --> 00:50:00,814
One way in, one way out.

652
00:50:01,490 --> 00:50:03,583
Thought we were going to eat.

653
00:50:03,992 --> 00:50:08,088
Don't ever come here without me.
I'm serious. For your safety.

654
00:50:13,936 --> 00:50:16,871
-How'd you get a golden pass?
-I treat them fair.

655
00:50:17,272 --> 00:50:20,673
They know if they cross the line,
I tax that ass.

656
00:50:34,423 --> 00:50:35,981
What's that, up there?

657
00:50:36,959 --> 00:50:40,258
They flipping pigeons
to signal I'm here.

658
00:51:07,923 --> 00:51:10,118
-What's up, Bone?
-What's up?

659
00:51:10,359 --> 00:51:12,190
-What's up?
-It's all good.

660
00:51:12,427 --> 00:51:15,794
I appreciate what you did
for my nephew.

661
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:17,692
For sure. For sure.

662
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:21,502
You better call me.

663
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:28,339
I'm sick of it.
I can't stand him!

664
00:51:28,744 --> 00:51:32,180
-Who are they?
-Nobody. I got them under my thumb.

665
00:51:32,414 --> 00:51:36,441
-What's up, Alonzo?
-All right, Spider. What's happening?

666
00:51:36,685 --> 00:51:40,086
Hey, what's up, girl? Look at you.
Go ahead.

667
00:51:40,322 --> 00:51:42,586
All that jelly and no toast.

668
00:51:43,025 --> 00:51:46,461
-Who lives here?
-Just one of my lovelies.

669
00:51:46,695 --> 00:51:49,255
A loving touch, you know?
Don't worry.

670
00:52:14,656 --> 00:52:16,647
New guy, Jake.

671
00:52:19,027 --> 00:52:22,053
Nice to meet you.
Welcome to my house.

672
00:52:22,297 --> 00:52:25,789
-Give him some food. Take care of him.
-Of course.

673
00:52:28,637 --> 00:52:32,368
-Of course. How are you?
-Good, good.

674
00:52:34,042 --> 00:52:38,172
I have cable.
You watch whatever you want, okay?

675
00:52:38,747 --> 00:52:41,113
-Thanks.
-This is your house.

676
00:52:42,851 --> 00:52:44,250
I'll be right back.

677
00:52:54,062 --> 00:52:56,189
-How you doing?
-Fine.

678
00:53:02,704 --> 00:53:07,107
Now, this is all El Salvadorian food.

679
00:53:07,342 --> 00:53:09,173
Thank you. It looks great.

680
00:53:12,714 --> 00:53:13,681
I have to go.

681
00:53:14,249 --> 00:53:16,581
Yeah, all right.

682
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:04,460
Let's go.
We got a meeting in 1 5 minutes.

683
00:54:05,133 --> 00:54:07,601
-I just need to--
-Forget it. Let's go.

684
00:54:08,904 --> 00:54:10,303
I'll see you, buddy.

685
00:54:39,367 --> 00:54:40,561
You okay?

686
00:55:18,907 --> 00:55:20,169
Here, use this.

687
00:55:21,476 --> 00:55:23,239
-Who's here?
-L.A.P.D.'s finest.

688
00:55:23,478 --> 00:55:25,776
Don't speak till you're spoken to.

689
00:55:26,081 --> 00:55:27,070
Come on.

690
00:55:44,566 --> 00:55:45,590
Good to see you.

691
00:55:45,834 --> 00:55:49,930
That's my new guy. Jake Hoyt.
Captain Lou Jacobs.

692
00:55:50,172 --> 00:55:52,766
Need to talk to the feds,
go to him first.

693
00:55:53,008 --> 00:55:54,839
He'll take your back for you.

694
00:55:55,076 --> 00:55:57,874
Stan Gursky,
he runs the D.A. shooting team.

695
00:55:58,113 --> 00:56:00,707
Think about him
before you shoot someone.

696
00:56:00,949 --> 00:56:04,214
If you're wrong,
he'll use your nuts for dice.

697
00:56:04,452 --> 00:56:07,512
Right here,
Detective Doug Rosselli...

698
00:56:07,756 --> 00:56:11,590
...handles theft cases
for the French-poodle crowd.

699
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:13,817
He's a good man.

700
00:56:14,062 --> 00:56:16,360
-Pleased to meet you.
-Good man.

701
00:56:17,465 --> 00:56:19,023
-Should I...?
-Shoo.

702
00:56:19,267 --> 00:56:21,531
Get yourself a steak or something.

703
00:56:22,704 --> 00:56:24,433
All right, gents.

704
00:56:25,574 --> 00:56:29,442
I don't know why I'm meeting you.
I don't talk to dead men.

705
00:56:30,145 --> 00:56:31,669
I ain't dead yet.

706
00:56:32,013 --> 00:56:34,641
Fucking prick. Excuse me.

707
00:56:37,018 --> 00:56:38,542
Why the long face, Doug?

708
00:56:39,154 --> 00:56:42,749
-Feds seize your house or something?
-Fuck yourself.

709
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:45,083
Tell him the story.

710
00:56:45,894 --> 00:56:47,384
Come on, tell the story.

711
00:56:47,629 --> 00:56:51,326
-If it's so funny, you tell him.
-It's your story.

712
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:54,164
Asshole.

713
00:56:57,305 --> 00:56:59,773
All right.
There's a serial burglar.

714
00:57:02,077 --> 00:57:04,443
Chased him for a year.
A real slickster.

715
00:57:04,679 --> 00:57:07,170
Captain's riding my ass
the whole time.

716
00:57:07,716 --> 00:57:10,344
-Sentencing was today.
-Judge is female.

717
00:57:10,719 --> 00:57:12,277
That's right. Landers.

718
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:14,920
I know Landers. She's a sharp lady.

719
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:19,349
No?

720
00:57:19,594 --> 00:57:24,361
Guy gets ahold of some peanut butter,
packs his ass-crack with it.

721
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:29,498
He's standing before the bench,
waiting to give his statement.

722
00:57:29,738 --> 00:57:34,141
Shoves his hand down his pants,
comes out with extra-chunky Jif.

723
00:57:37,545 --> 00:57:39,410
Bailiffs won't come near him.

724
00:57:43,718 --> 00:57:47,051
Now he looks the judge
right in the eyes...

725
00:57:47,289 --> 00:57:49,519
...and licks his fingers clean.

726
00:57:51,726 --> 00:57:52,988
Holy shit.

727
00:57:53,828 --> 00:57:55,728
So the judge says:

728
00:57:55,964 --> 00:57:58,728
"This man's insane.
He can't go to prison."

729
00:57:58,967 --> 00:58:01,936
-Sends him to Psychiatric.
-She fell for it.

730
00:58:02,170 --> 00:58:04,035
Yeah! She's so fucking smart.

731
00:58:04,372 --> 00:58:08,832
By the time she found out,
the guy's already been transferred.

732
00:58:14,416 --> 00:58:17,112
-Proceedings closed.
-Yeah, closed.

733
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:20,782
He'll do six months
in the puzzle factory...

734
00:58:21,022 --> 00:58:22,489
...and they'll let him go.

735
00:58:22,724 --> 00:58:24,885
Never, ever do a day in prison.

736
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:29,229
Give him credit. He worked the system,
deserves his freedom.

737
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:31,432
Yeah? Think so?

738
00:58:31,966 --> 00:58:33,160
Or not.

739
00:58:34,803 --> 00:58:36,202
I'll tell you what.

740
00:58:36,938 --> 00:58:39,236
I'll find this guy on the street...

741
00:58:39,808 --> 00:58:41,241
...and I'll do him.

742
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:48,414
Better take his bullets away,
Stan.

743
00:58:49,451 --> 00:58:50,850
Shit!

744
00:58:54,556 --> 00:58:57,616
Heard you had an expensive weekend
in Vegas.

745
00:58:58,526 --> 00:59:02,121
How did you ever screw up so bad?

746
00:59:02,364 --> 00:59:05,356
It's nothing.
I didn't know. It's not my town.

747
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:08,125
The Russians don't care
if you're a cop.

748
00:59:08,770 --> 00:59:11,796
They'll whack you.
You ought to get on a plane.

749
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:13,166
Why?

750
00:59:13,775 --> 00:59:15,766
-It's an easy fix.
-How?

751
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:17,944
I'll just cash in an account.

752
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:21,910
-Whose?
-One of my old ones. My first one.

753
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:25,884
The guy's a high-security risk.

754
00:59:26,121 --> 00:59:29,420
If I'm not around,
who will keep him off the radar?

755
00:59:29,657 --> 00:59:33,218
I'm just taxing him, that's all.
Okay?

756
00:59:41,669 --> 00:59:43,193
It's your call.

757
00:59:44,406 --> 00:59:46,271
Don't dick this up.

758
00:59:46,508 --> 00:59:50,774
I do not want to see you
on the front page like the others.

759
00:59:51,813 --> 00:59:53,280
Yeah, I understand.

760
00:59:54,749 --> 00:59:55,716
Who's driving?

761
00:59:56,684 --> 00:59:58,481
Me. Gray Mercedes.

762
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:02,614
Get the car.

763
01:00:05,226 --> 01:00:09,219
Black Monte Carlo there,
back windows shot out.

764
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:26,107
It's me.
Listen, we got the green light.

765
01:00:26,648 --> 01:00:29,845
Fax a copy
of the warrant to the clerk.

766
01:00:30,084 --> 01:00:34,714
Get it signed by the judge, and I want
you and Paul to bring it to me.

767
01:00:34,956 --> 01:00:38,392
Tell Jeff to pick up some tools.
Picks and shovels.

768
01:00:38,626 --> 01:00:42,824
Make sure he signs them out
from maintenance. Copy?

769
01:00:43,465 --> 01:00:45,865
That's right. Hurry up! Later.

770
01:00:47,735 --> 01:00:50,260
So how much cash was in that jacket?

771
01:00:50,939 --> 01:00:52,668
Forty G's.

772
01:00:53,074 --> 01:00:54,905
What's that for?

773
01:00:55,443 --> 01:00:58,037
-Really want to know?
-Yes, I do.

774
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:03,341
Nothing's free in this world.
Not even arrest warrants.

775
01:01:04,552 --> 01:01:06,679
Shit, man, I didn't want to know.

776
01:01:18,032 --> 01:01:20,830
Check this out.
Nice suit, Mark.

777
01:01:21,069 --> 01:01:24,004
-Beautiful suit.
-Yeah, fuck you guys!

778
01:01:41,923 --> 01:01:43,720
All right. Nice, nice.

779
01:01:44,225 --> 01:01:45,715
What's up, Alonzo?

780
01:01:46,327 --> 01:01:48,727
-The picks and shovels?
-In the trunk.

781
01:01:49,130 --> 01:01:50,256
Digging a ditch?

782
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:55,101
No, you are.
Nice suit you got on there.

783
01:01:55,336 --> 01:01:57,133
That's what I said.

784
01:01:58,039 --> 01:02:00,633
-What up, killer?
-What's up with you?

785
01:02:00,875 --> 01:02:04,242
-Heard you ran into trouble.
-It's all good.

786
01:02:04,479 --> 01:02:06,811
Don't worry, everything's fine.

787
01:02:07,048 --> 01:02:10,609
Shit, if we can get away with it,
I'm with you.

788
01:02:11,619 --> 01:02:16,181
-Who the fuck is this?
-Jake Hoyt. It's my first day.

789
01:02:16,424 --> 01:02:18,915
You're a long way from Starbucks.

790
01:02:21,362 --> 01:02:25,162
-Why the fuck is he here?
-Gotta get his cherry popped.

791
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:27,300
Stay the fuck out of my way.

792
01:02:27,535 --> 01:02:30,402
This is for the big dogs. Feel me?

793
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:34,668
Here it is, all legit,
signed by the judge, okay?

794
01:02:34,943 --> 01:02:37,241
Thanks to the Sandman.
Now listen.

795
01:02:37,478 --> 01:02:39,070
Safety is first.

796
01:02:39,314 --> 01:02:41,839
He gives us shit,
we give him lead.

797
01:02:42,083 --> 01:02:45,450
Let's do this right
so we can all go home.

798
01:02:46,387 --> 01:02:48,446
Time to punch in, ladies.

799
01:03:36,537 --> 01:03:38,596
Freeze! On the floor!

800
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:41,274
-Down!
-What are you clowns doing?

801
01:03:41,509 --> 01:03:43,875
Hey, new guy, watch him!

802
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:47,938
-I'm on him.
-You know what you're doing?

803
01:03:48,182 --> 01:03:49,410
Drop your gun!

804
01:03:49,651 --> 01:03:52,347
Five. Four. Three.

805
01:03:54,188 --> 01:03:55,746
Boom!

806
01:03:57,959 --> 01:04:00,086
Give me a reason.

807
01:04:00,628 --> 01:04:03,119
Alonzo's gonna have your ass.

808
01:04:03,531 --> 01:04:05,260
What's up, Roger?

809
01:04:05,933 --> 01:04:09,926
-What's going down, brother?
-Oh, it's all good, baby.

810
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:14,069
It's all good.

811
01:04:16,911 --> 01:04:19,072
That's for you.

812
01:04:21,349 --> 01:04:24,477
What am I supposed to do with this?
Wipe my ass?

813
01:04:27,288 --> 01:04:29,279
Bad news, dog.

814
01:04:29,524 --> 01:04:32,652
Gimme some of that $300-a-glass shit.

815
01:04:32,894 --> 01:04:35,021
Please.

816
01:04:35,897 --> 01:04:38,491
Had lunch with the wise men.

817
01:04:38,733 --> 01:04:40,792
You gotta render unto Caesar.

818
01:04:41,035 --> 01:04:44,471
-Those vampires want my pension.
-No, no.

819
01:04:49,911 --> 01:04:51,208
Just a tax.

820
01:04:51,446 --> 01:04:55,610
They got their boats and mistresses,
house payments.

821
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:59,650
Nothing I can do.
I'm just a lowly civil servant.

822
01:05:00,021 --> 01:05:02,080
You're their bitch.

823
01:05:02,323 --> 01:05:05,019
-What about me?
-I got your back.

824
01:05:05,326 --> 01:05:09,319
Don't worry, we won't
take anything you'll miss.

825
01:05:11,199 --> 01:05:13,394
I'm sorry. Orders, dog.

826
01:05:13,634 --> 01:05:14,931
No you ain't, cop.

827
01:05:17,205 --> 01:05:19,036
In the kitchen, fellas.

828
01:05:19,841 --> 01:05:21,706
Give me the bitch.

829
01:05:23,077 --> 01:05:25,409
You guys hold him down.

830
01:05:26,347 --> 01:05:28,611
-Who'll pay for my floor?
-The city.

831
01:05:37,759 --> 01:05:39,283
Right here.

832
01:06:17,665 --> 01:06:20,156
That's what I'm talking about.

833
01:06:28,376 --> 01:06:30,037
What's in here? Coke?

834
01:06:30,278 --> 01:06:31,768
You'll see.

835
01:06:32,013 --> 01:06:35,813
Grab that hammer
and knock this lock off.

836
01:06:38,252 --> 01:06:40,584
One, two....

837
01:06:48,830 --> 01:06:51,196
That's $250,000 you're holding.

838
01:06:51,432 --> 01:06:53,866
Over four million in here.

839
01:06:54,101 --> 01:06:56,069
A $3 million bust on day one.

840
01:06:56,304 --> 01:06:59,501
-You said four.
-Minus tax, brother!

841
01:06:59,740 --> 01:07:02,231
Nothing's free in this world.

842
01:07:02,577 --> 01:07:06,911
Buy your wife a car.
Put the kids through college.

843
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:10,276
The only checks I cash say "L.A.P.D."

844
01:07:11,986 --> 01:07:14,682
Somebody didn't sleep
through Ethics.

845
01:07:15,957 --> 01:07:18,391
You don't want a piece of this?

846
01:07:21,028 --> 01:07:22,757
No, right?

847
01:07:23,731 --> 01:07:25,198
Not like this.

848
01:07:25,433 --> 01:07:27,401
No.

849
01:07:28,236 --> 01:07:30,329
No?

850
01:07:34,008 --> 01:07:38,638
First time, you're not comfortable.
I'll hold it for you.

851
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:41,747
-What about you?
-Oh, I'm comfortable.

852
01:07:42,717 --> 01:07:45,413
-How about you?
-I'm very comfortable.

853
01:07:45,786 --> 01:07:47,811
Let's wrap this up.

854
01:07:50,925 --> 01:07:53,917
Don't touch a thing! Evidence.

855
01:07:58,566 --> 01:08:01,558
Alonzo, what are
those pricks thinking?

856
01:08:01,802 --> 01:08:06,239
That I'm gonna stand still and
let them horsefuck me?

857
01:08:06,507 --> 01:08:09,704
Could put you out of your misery.

858
01:08:11,245 --> 01:08:12,507
Hey, Jake, here.

859
01:08:14,248 --> 01:08:16,375
Sit down.

860
01:08:21,088 --> 01:08:22,578
Here's a secret:

861
01:08:22,823 --> 01:08:24,916
When you kill someone on duty...

862
01:08:25,159 --> 01:08:28,993
...they have to be your slave
in the afterlife.

863
01:08:32,934 --> 01:08:35,027
There you go.

864
01:08:35,369 --> 01:08:36,996
Start an entourage.

865
01:08:40,741 --> 01:08:42,003
-Shoot him?
-Yeah.

866
01:08:42,276 --> 01:08:44,904
Come on, kid. Do me a favor.

867
01:08:45,146 --> 01:08:46,841
Come on.

868
01:08:47,214 --> 01:08:49,341
Do yourself a favor. Hit him.

869
01:08:49,583 --> 01:08:50,811
Are you serious?

870
01:08:51,452 --> 01:08:53,920
Hey, close the blinds.

871
01:09:04,231 --> 01:09:06,756
-All right, I'll shoot him.
-Go.

872
01:09:11,272 --> 01:09:12,398
-Pow!
-Boom!

873
01:09:15,543 --> 01:09:17,067
Shoot him.

874
01:09:17,511 --> 01:09:18,944
No, man.

875
01:09:20,848 --> 01:09:23,612
Kids these days.
Not gonna do it?

876
01:09:23,851 --> 01:09:26,376
All right, give it to me.

877
01:09:26,821 --> 01:09:27,845
Rookies!

878
01:09:28,089 --> 01:09:31,081
You want shit done,
you gotta do it yourself.

879
01:09:32,626 --> 01:09:33,593
Holy shit!

880
01:09:35,396 --> 01:09:37,364
Come on, breathe.

881
01:09:37,598 --> 01:09:39,759
Breathe, there you go.

882
01:09:42,903 --> 01:09:44,131
Just let it go.

883
01:09:45,306 --> 01:09:46,933
Breathe, dog!

884
01:09:55,916 --> 01:09:56,905
He's finished.

885
01:10:04,358 --> 01:10:05,552
All right, Jeff.

886
01:10:05,793 --> 01:10:07,556
You took fire coming in.

887
01:10:07,795 --> 01:10:10,229
I need some time off, but....

888
01:10:12,033 --> 01:10:14,866
-Watch the shades.
-All right.

889
01:10:18,406 --> 01:10:19,896
-Ready?
-Kiss me.

890
01:10:20,141 --> 01:10:21,665
One....

891
01:10:24,412 --> 01:10:25,572
-You okay?
-Yeah.

892
01:10:25,813 --> 01:10:28,247
I gotta give you one more, though.

893
01:10:28,482 --> 01:10:29,506
Do it.

894
01:10:30,317 --> 01:10:32,148
Fuck!

895
01:10:32,586 --> 01:10:35,555
It's not what you know,
it's what you prove.

896
01:10:35,790 --> 01:10:39,226
Here it is.
Mark and Paul kick the door.

897
01:10:39,460 --> 01:10:42,361
Jeff's in first.
Roger fires twice.

898
01:10:46,767 --> 01:10:48,701
What, one go through?

899
01:10:48,936 --> 01:10:52,099
-You shot him!
-You fucking shot me, man!

900
01:10:52,339 --> 01:10:54,534
-Don't worry.
-Call an ambulance!

901
01:10:55,342 --> 01:10:57,572
Go to jail, or go home?

902
01:10:57,812 --> 01:11:00,007
All right, here's the scenario.

903
01:11:00,247 --> 01:11:03,614
Mark and Paul kick the door.
Jeff runs in.

904
01:11:03,851 --> 01:11:06,081
Roger opens fire, hits Jeff.

905
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:10,984
Hoyt is in second,
drops Roger with the shotgun.

906
01:11:11,225 --> 01:11:13,318
-Who shot Roger?
-New guy.

907
01:11:13,661 --> 01:11:15,026
-New guy.
-You two?

908
01:11:15,262 --> 01:11:18,595
-Hoyt.
-Fuck Hoyt. Ambulance time!

909
01:11:18,833 --> 01:11:21,199
Done. Paul, call them up.

910
01:11:21,435 --> 01:11:24,233
1 1 -49. 998. Shots fired.

911
01:11:24,472 --> 01:11:27,066
Officer down. Repeat, officer down.

912
01:11:27,308 --> 01:11:29,674
5951 Baxter Street.

913
01:11:30,177 --> 01:11:34,773
Congratulations. You're gonna get
a medal of valor for this.

914
01:11:35,015 --> 01:11:37,506
-I didn't shoot him.
-Four cops saw it.

915
01:11:37,751 --> 01:11:40,015
But I didn't. You did.

916
01:11:42,890 --> 01:11:48,487
"An L.A.P.D. narcotics officer
was killed today...

917
01:11:48,729 --> 01:11:51,323
...serving a warrant
in Echo Park."

918
01:11:51,565 --> 01:11:53,055
Give me the bitch.

919
01:11:56,437 --> 01:12:00,737
"A spokesperson said
the officer is survived...

920
01:12:02,209 --> 01:12:03,733
...by a wife and child."

921
01:12:04,178 --> 01:12:06,612
There's more. You get the picture?

922
01:12:06,847 --> 01:12:08,371
Yeah, I get it.

923
01:12:09,483 --> 01:12:13,044
That's the second time
you pointed a gun at me!

924
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:15,721
Goddamn, boy! That's it, Jake!

925
01:12:16,056 --> 01:12:18,524
Y'all see this?
That's it!

926
01:12:18,759 --> 01:12:22,195
-I'll put a bullet in that melon.
-Wait, wait.

927
01:12:22,496 --> 01:12:25,021
I'm gonna be cool. Drop the gun!

928
01:12:25,266 --> 01:12:27,393
Shoot me.
He's coming with me.

929
01:12:27,635 --> 01:12:29,432
-I'll shoot!
-He's a fed.

930
01:12:29,670 --> 01:12:34,130
No, he ain't. He's just a kid
that got the drop on y'all.

931
01:12:34,375 --> 01:12:38,937
Let's take a deep breath
and just diffuse this. Jake?

932
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:41,910
I didn't sign up for this!

933
01:12:42,149 --> 01:12:45,812
I know you're angry.
Everybody, put the guns down.

934
01:12:46,053 --> 01:12:48,578
-Hell, no.
-Choirboy first.

935
01:12:48,822 --> 01:12:51,154
Listen! That's an order!

936
01:12:51,392 --> 01:12:53,292
Put them down!

937
01:13:01,035 --> 01:13:03,435
Use your ears, Jake.

938
01:13:03,671 --> 01:13:06,606
Sometimes we take this shit
all the way.

939
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:09,331
It's the nature of the business.

940
01:13:09,577 --> 01:13:14,446
You'll never have to pull
the trigger again, all right?

941
01:13:14,882 --> 01:13:17,851
-Mark, where are you transferring?
-S.I.S.

942
01:13:18,519 --> 01:13:19,611
Detective.

943
01:13:19,853 --> 01:13:23,880
You give me 18 months,
I give you a career.

944
01:13:24,124 --> 01:13:26,991
We make the big seizures, Jake.

945
01:13:27,228 --> 01:13:31,358
But if you're in my unit,
you gotta be in it all the way.

946
01:13:31,599 --> 01:13:34,659
I thought you were man enough
to handle this shit.

947
01:13:34,902 --> 01:13:38,770
Five decorated officers say
that you shot Roger.

948
01:13:39,006 --> 01:13:42,840
They will check your blood
for intoxicants.

949
01:13:43,077 --> 01:13:44,977
What are they gonna find?

950
01:13:45,813 --> 01:13:48,941
You've been smoking PCP all day.

951
01:13:49,183 --> 01:13:53,051
-You've been planning this all day.
-All week, son.

952
01:13:53,287 --> 01:13:56,848
You talk, your blood gets to the lab.

953
01:13:57,091 --> 01:14:00,993
You wanna take a walk?
You won't make it out of here.

954
01:14:01,228 --> 01:14:03,856
If you're cool, you're a hero.

955
01:14:04,098 --> 01:14:06,089
You're above suspicion.

956
01:14:06,333 --> 01:14:08,631
Alonzo, there's two shots left.

957
01:14:08,969 --> 01:14:12,700
We need to kill him now
and say Roger got him.

958
01:14:14,842 --> 01:14:17,106
No, we ain't killing nobody.

959
01:14:17,344 --> 01:14:20,575
This is a good man. I can feel it.

960
01:14:20,814 --> 01:14:24,773
Just had a little freak-out,
that's all.

961
01:14:25,019 --> 01:14:26,919
I say he's cool.

962
01:14:27,154 --> 01:14:29,884
Nobody's gonna hurt him.

963
01:14:30,124 --> 01:14:32,354
You do have a decision to make.

964
01:14:32,593 --> 01:14:36,859
Because this place is gonna
be overrun with blue suits.

965
01:14:37,097 --> 01:14:41,864
So why don't you please
go outside, clear your head.

966
01:14:43,504 --> 01:14:45,768
Or shoot me.

967
01:14:58,752 --> 01:14:59,741
Hey, Paul?

968
01:15:05,092 --> 01:15:08,323
You're dead, motherfucker!
You hear me?! Dead!

969
01:16:25,205 --> 01:16:28,140
Well, lay off the device.

970
01:16:28,542 --> 01:16:29,873
All right.

971
01:16:31,645 --> 01:16:34,011
Make sure that tub is clean.

972
01:16:34,848 --> 01:16:36,315
All right?

973
01:16:39,253 --> 01:16:41,619
All right, later.

974
01:16:45,859 --> 01:16:47,554
You all right?

975
01:16:53,534 --> 01:16:56,970
It behooves you not
to dick around on this one.

976
01:16:57,938 --> 01:17:00,600
Justifiable homicide
in the line of duty.

977
01:17:00,841 --> 01:17:03,867
-Now, what happened--
-What happened was murder.

978
01:17:04,111 --> 01:17:06,705
And armed robbery.

979
01:17:06,980 --> 01:17:09,175
We had badges, so it's different?

980
01:17:09,416 --> 01:17:12,249
Son, open your eyes! Can't you see?

981
01:17:12,486 --> 01:17:17,185
That man was your friend,
and you killed him like a fly.

982
01:17:17,424 --> 01:17:19,153
My friend? Tell me why?

983
01:17:19,426 --> 01:17:22,452
Because he knows my first name?

984
01:17:22,696 --> 01:17:25,494
This is the game.
I played his ass.

985
01:17:25,732 --> 01:17:27,893
That's our job.

986
01:17:28,135 --> 01:17:33,004
Roger sold dope to kids.
The world's better off without him.

987
01:17:34,107 --> 01:17:39,067
This man was the biggest
major violator in Los Angeles.

988
01:17:39,313 --> 01:17:43,716
I watched that cocksucker for years
and now I got him.

989
01:17:43,951 --> 01:17:45,885
This is chess, not checkers!

990
01:17:53,994 --> 01:17:57,794
What'd you think?
We'd roll up in a black and white?

991
01:17:58,031 --> 01:18:00,022
Slap the cuffs on him?

992
01:18:00,267 --> 01:18:02,235
He's a high roller, dog.

993
01:18:06,206 --> 01:18:08,265
-Take the money.
-I'm not taking it.

994
01:18:08,509 --> 01:18:09,942
-Just take it.
-No!

995
01:18:10,177 --> 01:18:14,204
Look, I don't give a fuck, but
the boys'll feel better.

996
01:18:14,448 --> 01:18:16,746
Fuck their feelings!

997
01:18:16,984 --> 01:18:18,542
Jake, we're a team.

998
01:18:18,785 --> 01:18:20,719
A team?

999
01:18:20,954 --> 01:18:23,514
You guys are fucking insane.

1000
01:18:23,757 --> 01:18:27,454
I'll go back to the Valley,
I'll cut parking tickets.

1001
01:18:31,865 --> 01:18:34,425
-It can't be like this.
-It is.

1002
01:18:34,668 --> 01:18:36,363
I'm sorry, but it is.

1003
01:18:36,603 --> 01:18:38,935
It's ugly, but it's necessary.

1004
01:18:39,172 --> 01:18:44,235
I became a cop to put away
dealers and criminals, not to be one.

1005
01:18:44,478 --> 01:18:46,036
You sound just like me.

1006
01:18:46,413 --> 01:18:49,314
I know what you're
going through and feeling.

1007
01:18:49,550 --> 01:18:51,040
-You're scared.
-I'm not.

1008
01:18:51,285 --> 01:18:55,779
Yes, you are. Everyone goes
through that the first time. I did.

1009
01:18:56,857 --> 01:19:01,260
The sooner you match
what's in your head...

1010
01:19:01,495 --> 01:19:04,259
...with what's in the real world...

1011
01:19:04,498 --> 01:19:06,363
...the better you'll feel.

1012
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:08,227
In this business...

1013
01:19:08,468 --> 01:19:12,097
...you gotta have dirt on you
to be trusted.

1014
01:19:13,073 --> 01:19:17,601
When all this is behind you, a whole
other world will open up for you.

1015
01:19:20,013 --> 01:19:22,379
I walk a higher path, son.

1016
01:19:22,616 --> 01:19:25,449
I have the keys to all the doors.

1017
01:19:27,087 --> 01:19:28,486
What do you mean?

1018
01:19:29,656 --> 01:19:32,955
My guys aren't leaders, they're clowns.
You're a leader.

1019
01:19:33,193 --> 01:19:34,956
You want my job?
You got it.

1020
01:19:35,195 --> 01:19:38,926
You want to lock up poisoners?
This is the place to do it.

1021
01:19:40,901 --> 01:19:43,131
But you gotta take your time.

1022
01:19:43,370 --> 01:19:46,339
You'll make detective,
you'll grow wise.

1023
01:19:46,573 --> 01:19:49,599
And then you can change things.

1024
01:19:50,043 --> 01:19:52,671
But it's gotta be from the inside.

1025
01:19:56,049 --> 01:20:00,713
Let's go downtown to the station.
Talk to my guy, Stan.

1026
01:20:01,388 --> 01:20:04,824
He'll go through what you
gotta say to the D.A.

1027
01:20:55,909 --> 01:20:57,342
What are we doing now?

1028
01:20:57,577 --> 01:21:01,980
I told an informant I'd take care
of his family for him.

1029
01:21:05,252 --> 01:21:07,880
Bring them food, stuff like that.

1030
01:21:08,121 --> 01:21:11,557
Gotta help out the family.

1031
01:21:12,125 --> 01:21:15,492
Believe it or not,
I do try to do some good.

1032
01:21:19,299 --> 01:21:21,460
You know where you're at, dog?

1033
01:21:27,441 --> 01:21:30,001
The fuck you looking at?

1034
01:22:05,412 --> 01:22:08,745
Hey, we got some things
for the family.

1035
01:22:21,728 --> 01:22:23,628
Kitchen's this way.

1036
01:22:31,104 --> 01:22:32,799
Put it on the counter.

1037
01:22:33,039 --> 01:22:36,304
-Where's the head?
-Right through.

1038
01:22:43,884 --> 01:22:47,980
I'm gonna go to the head.
Two seconds, we're gone.

1039
01:22:48,622 --> 01:22:51,182
Hey, let me get the CD player.

1040
01:22:52,726 --> 01:22:54,523
No, the CD player's mine.

1041
01:22:54,761 --> 01:22:56,194
Dreamer! Come here!

1042
01:22:58,165 --> 01:23:00,463
Count that shit, all right?

1043
01:23:01,501 --> 01:23:03,867
Thanks a lot, I was busy.

1044
01:23:04,104 --> 01:23:07,096
Learn how to count, fucking math whiz.

1045
01:23:09,910 --> 01:23:11,639
-You looked!
-I didn't.

1046
01:23:11,878 --> 01:23:14,346
<i>You calling me a cheater, ¨¦se?</i>

1047
01:23:14,648 --> 01:23:16,240
Deal again, Sniper.

1048
01:23:19,419 --> 01:23:21,683
You play cards, cop?

1049
01:23:21,955 --> 01:23:23,388
No, not really.

1050
01:23:23,623 --> 01:23:24,851
Want a beer?

1051
01:23:25,091 --> 01:23:26,388
Have a cold one.

1052
01:23:27,127 --> 01:23:29,061
No, thanks, I'm good.

1053
01:23:29,296 --> 01:23:32,993
Come on, sit down.
Play a card game with us.

1054
01:23:33,233 --> 01:23:35,895
<i>Don't be rude, ¨¦se. You're a guest.</i>

1055
01:23:36,136 --> 01:23:38,070
Why don't you play one hand?

1056
01:23:38,905 --> 01:23:41,373
Don't worry, we ain't betting money.

1057
01:23:41,608 --> 01:23:43,508
We gotta roll in a second.

1058
01:23:43,743 --> 01:23:45,768
Alonzo's taking a shit.

1059
01:23:49,082 --> 01:23:51,573
All right, I'll play one hand.

1060
01:23:52,552 --> 01:23:54,452
Is this five-card draw?

1061
01:23:55,055 --> 01:23:57,819
Yeah, jokers are wild.

1062
01:23:58,091 --> 01:24:00,582
Why don't you tell us something?

1063
01:24:00,827 --> 01:24:03,421
How long you been a pig?

1064
01:24:03,897 --> 01:24:06,058
My bad. My bad.

1065
01:24:06,299 --> 01:24:09,200
I meant a police officer.

1066
01:24:09,502 --> 01:24:11,629
I've been a pig for 1 9 months.

1067
01:24:11,872 --> 01:24:14,033
Is that right? You like it?

1068
01:24:14,274 --> 01:24:17,437
I should've been a fireman.
One more.

1069
01:24:20,580 --> 01:24:23,310
-What you got, dog?
-Three of a kind.

1070
01:24:23,550 --> 01:24:25,984
I didn't get shit.

1071
01:24:26,219 --> 01:24:28,187
Boo-ya, baby!

1072
01:24:28,955 --> 01:24:31,981
Two pair!

1073
01:24:34,728 --> 01:24:35,752
What the fuck?

1074
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:38,258
He won.

1075
01:24:39,132 --> 01:24:41,600
I got two pair!

1076
01:24:42,269 --> 01:24:46,365
Three of a kind beats two pair,
you fucking dumb truck.

1077
01:24:48,475 --> 01:24:51,842
You're fucking stupid.
Take your medication.

1078
01:24:52,112 --> 01:24:54,444
Seriously. I know I'm number one.

1079
01:24:54,748 --> 01:24:59,208
<i>See why we don't play for money?
Because of this vato.</i>

1080
01:24:59,953 --> 01:25:02,046
<i>-Show me your cohete.
-What?</i>

1081
01:25:02,289 --> 01:25:05,884
Your gun, homes.
Underneath your shirt.

1082
01:25:06,393 --> 01:25:08,520
What is it, .380 stainless?

1083
01:25:08,762 --> 01:25:10,457
-9mm Beretta.
-Like that?

1084
01:25:13,700 --> 01:25:15,395
-Just like it.
-Yeah?

1085
01:25:16,036 --> 01:25:17,526
Here's the problem.

1086
01:25:18,838 --> 01:25:22,035
I seen this one.
I want to see yours.

1087
01:25:23,576 --> 01:25:27,034
<i>Come on, ¨¦se,
I ain't gonna shoot nobody.</i>

1088
01:25:29,916 --> 01:25:32,282
Let me check it out.

1089
01:25:42,696 --> 01:25:44,789
Learn that in the Academy?

1090
01:25:45,031 --> 01:25:47,795
Neat trick.
This is nice.

1091
01:25:48,034 --> 01:25:52,061
<i>Nice.
You could fuck a vato up with this.</i>

1092
01:25:54,207 --> 01:25:57,370
What you do is, you aim like that.

1093
01:26:01,081 --> 01:26:02,912
I'm just playing.

1094
01:26:03,149 --> 01:26:05,913
Yeah, I gotta go.
Alonzo!

1095
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:08,979
Kick back and party.

1096
01:26:09,222 --> 01:26:11,782
Ain't nothing out there for you.

1097
01:26:12,025 --> 01:26:14,186
What are you talking about?

1098
01:26:17,464 --> 01:26:18,726
Hey, white boy.

1099
01:26:19,399 --> 01:26:23,563
If you ask me homes,
that's just, of course, if you ask...

1100
01:26:23,803 --> 01:26:25,794
<i>...Alonzo played you, ¨¦se.</i>

1101
01:26:26,272 --> 01:26:28,604
Big time.

1102
01:26:28,975 --> 01:26:31,341
Wait, where you going?

1103
01:26:32,512 --> 01:26:35,345
It's your deal.

1104
01:26:45,158 --> 01:26:47,353
It's all there.

1105
01:26:47,761 --> 01:26:50,730
-Sure?
-You can count it yourself.

1106
01:26:56,202 --> 01:26:58,898
Alonzo pulled off a miracle.

1107
01:26:59,472 --> 01:27:01,906
Times are tight.
Scared up a lot of cash.

1108
01:27:02,142 --> 01:27:04,406
Who'd he jack, homes?

1109
01:27:04,878 --> 01:27:06,209
I don't know.

1110
01:27:10,050 --> 01:27:12,450
He jacked Roger.

1111
01:27:12,685 --> 01:27:14,152
Blasted that fool.

1112
01:27:14,387 --> 01:27:18,289
<i>Alonzo's a low-down, ruthless vato.</i>

1113
01:27:18,525 --> 01:27:20,356
But I like that.

1114
01:27:22,328 --> 01:27:25,024
That's why I never shake his hand.

1115
01:27:25,398 --> 01:27:27,992
<i>He don't respect nada.</i>

1116
01:27:28,234 --> 01:27:30,634
Know what the money's for?

1117
01:27:30,870 --> 01:27:33,896
Alonzo, he's a hothead.

1118
01:27:34,140 --> 01:27:37,598
Last week in Vegas, some Russian
starts talking shit.

1119
01:27:37,844 --> 01:27:40,779
Alonzo, he just snapped.

1120
01:27:41,014 --> 01:27:43,278
Beat his ass to death.

1121
01:27:43,516 --> 01:27:47,179
Turns out, that Russian,
he's a somebody.

1122
01:27:47,420 --> 01:27:52,323
Now, Alonzo's into the Russians
for a million.

1123
01:27:52,725 --> 01:27:54,693
How do you know that?

1124
01:27:58,698 --> 01:28:01,292
Alonzo has until tonight to pay up.

1125
01:28:01,534 --> 01:28:04,025
But he's still on their list.

1126
01:28:04,437 --> 01:28:07,235
Nobody thought he could
get the cash.

1127
01:28:08,341 --> 01:28:11,833
Good thing he did.
They're looking for him.

1128
01:28:12,812 --> 01:28:18,512
If he don't turn up downtown with
the cash by midnight....

1129
01:28:18,751 --> 01:28:20,446
<i>Your vato...</i>

1130
01:28:20,687 --> 01:28:22,052
...he's dead.

1131
01:28:22,922 --> 01:28:24,014
Hey, pig.

1132
01:28:24,257 --> 01:28:26,748
Ever had your shit pushed in?

1133
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:28,925
Simple question.

1134
01:28:29,162 --> 01:28:30,356
-No?
-No.

1135
01:28:30,830 --> 01:28:33,355
-Had my shit pushed in.
-Yeah, man.

1136
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:37,468
I had my shit pushed in, bro!

1137
01:28:37,704 --> 01:28:39,331
Big time!

1138
01:28:41,074 --> 01:28:42,701
Smiley?

1139
01:28:42,942 --> 01:28:46,844
Sure, I always get love
from the homeys.

1140
01:28:57,290 --> 01:28:59,121
You guys fucked him up!

1141
01:28:59,359 --> 01:29:00,690
Go next door.

1142
01:29:00,927 --> 01:29:03,191
Get the fuck out of here!

1143
01:29:05,431 --> 01:29:07,695
You fucked up.

1144
01:29:08,067 --> 01:29:09,932
You're under arrest!

1145
01:29:10,170 --> 01:29:14,766
For being a cop, dogging me
in the mouth in my own pad.

1146
01:29:15,375 --> 01:29:19,141
You got the right
to be bitch-slapped!

1147
01:29:22,649 --> 01:29:24,048
Drag him to the tub.

1148
01:29:24,284 --> 01:29:25,945
Punk motherfucker!

1149
01:29:28,421 --> 01:29:30,286
Raid his ass!

1150
01:29:52,812 --> 01:29:53,904
Do it!

1151
01:29:54,147 --> 01:29:55,842
It's gonna be loud.

1152
01:30:00,153 --> 01:30:01,984
Let me get his money.

1153
01:30:02,722 --> 01:30:04,349
-Wait.
-Hurry up.

1154
01:30:11,531 --> 01:30:13,431
Smiley, check it out.

1155
01:30:13,666 --> 01:30:16,134
Is that your little cousin?

1156
01:30:23,543 --> 01:30:25,943
-What's this?
-I found it!

1157
01:30:26,179 --> 01:30:27,771
-Who had it?
-I found it!

1158
01:30:28,581 --> 01:30:29,639
Where?

1159
01:30:29,882 --> 01:30:33,648
I found it in MacArthur Park!
MacArthur Park!

1160
01:30:38,691 --> 01:30:40,886
Wait up, I can't even see.

1161
01:30:41,127 --> 01:30:42,526
Shut the fuck up!

1162
01:30:42,762 --> 01:30:44,787
Get in your last prayer.

1163
01:30:45,031 --> 01:30:46,658
Listen to me, man.

1164
01:30:46,899 --> 01:30:48,526
She was being raped.

1165
01:30:48,768 --> 01:30:51,737
Two crackheads were attacking her...

1166
01:30:51,971 --> 01:30:54,906
...and I stopped them!
I swear to God!

1167
01:30:55,141 --> 01:30:58,975
-You're lying to me!
-I am not lying!

1168
01:30:59,412 --> 01:31:01,573
She was being raped!

1169
01:31:01,814 --> 01:31:03,145
I stopped them!

1170
01:31:03,383 --> 01:31:04,975
Please! I got a kid.

1171
01:31:05,218 --> 01:31:08,085
-Shut up, fag!
-Blast his ass.

1172
01:31:08,621 --> 01:31:11,920
I have a little girl!

1173
01:31:12,425 --> 01:31:13,687
Do it!

1174
01:31:15,361 --> 01:31:19,855
I'm gonna get to the bottom of your
bullshit. She's my cousin, homes.

1175
01:31:20,099 --> 01:31:22,067
Ain't right involving her.

1176
01:31:22,302 --> 01:31:23,360
You fucked up.

1177
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:30,070
If you're lying to me...

1178
01:31:30,310 --> 01:31:31,902
...I blow your balls off.

1179
01:31:32,145 --> 01:31:33,703
<i>-Hello.
-Hey, Letty.</i>

1180
01:31:33,946 --> 01:31:35,914
<i>-What's up?
-Hey, Smiley.</i>

1181
01:31:36,149 --> 01:31:38,845
Just doing homework. You want Tony?

1182
01:31:39,085 --> 01:31:40,484
No, I want you.

1183
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:43,689
-You go to school today?
-Yeah.

1184
01:31:44,090 --> 01:31:46,217
<i>-You didn't ditch?
-Nope.</i>

1185
01:31:46,459 --> 01:31:49,087
I went to every class. Why?

1186
01:31:49,329 --> 01:31:51,194
I heard different.

1187
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:55,665
Cops talk to you today?

1188
01:31:58,805 --> 01:32:01,603
<i>-No, no.
-All right, Letty...</i>

1189
01:32:01,841 --> 01:32:03,399
...don't bullshit me.

1190
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:10,371
I got jumped by two crackheads.

1191
01:32:10,616 --> 01:32:14,848
<i>-You got jumped?
-I think they wanted to rape me.</i>

1192
01:32:15,088 --> 01:32:17,386
<i>But nothing happened, okay?</i>

1193
01:32:17,623 --> 01:32:19,648
Because this cop came.

1194
01:32:19,892 --> 01:32:22,122
<i>They almost killed him...</i>

1195
01:32:22,362 --> 01:32:24,421
<i>...but he kicked their ass.</i>

1196
01:32:24,664 --> 01:32:25,961
Describe him.

1197
01:32:27,233 --> 01:32:31,169
He was a white boy.
He looked real young.

1198
01:32:31,404 --> 01:32:33,998
<i>-You're okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

1199
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:35,571
-Hey, Letty.
-Yeah?

1200
01:32:35,808 --> 01:32:37,070
We're not done.

1201
01:32:37,477 --> 01:32:38,444
Okay.

1202
01:32:39,879 --> 01:32:41,005
What's up?

1203
01:32:41,581 --> 01:32:42,980
You gonna blast him?

1204
01:32:45,885 --> 01:32:48,183
<i>Vato was telling the truth.</i>

1205
01:32:48,421 --> 01:32:50,116
<i>Life's a trip, qu¨¦ no?</i>

1206
01:32:50,490 --> 01:32:52,424
This is some trippy shit.

1207
01:33:06,806 --> 01:33:09,570
That's for getting my cousin's back.

1208
01:33:11,344 --> 01:33:14,507
Cover your head.
You'll mess up my floor.

1209
01:33:15,348 --> 01:33:18,340
You know this was just
business, right?

1210
01:33:21,954 --> 01:33:23,717
Right?

1211
01:33:25,358 --> 01:33:27,349
Right.

1212
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:45,034
What you doing here?
You know you don't belong here.

1213
01:34:49,141 --> 01:34:51,803
-What's up?
-Must be lost, motherfucker!

1214
01:34:53,212 --> 01:34:56,272
Gonna need more than that
up in here, boy!

1215
01:35:09,228 --> 01:35:11,389
You got business here, rookie?

1216
01:35:11,831 --> 01:35:13,890
I'm here for Alonzo.

1217
01:36:23,869 --> 01:36:26,633
Hey. Is your dad home?

1218
01:36:26,872 --> 01:36:29,272
-In the bedroom.
-He's in the bedroom?

1219
01:36:29,508 --> 01:36:32,102
All right, you wanna open up the door?

1220
01:36:32,411 --> 01:36:35,972
Okay. Thanks. You watching TV?

1221
01:36:37,283 --> 01:36:38,944
Yeah, anything good on?

1222
01:36:47,526 --> 01:36:50,962
-Do you want me to call my mom?
-No, I don't.

1223
01:36:52,098 --> 01:36:54,032
I'll tell you what I want.

1224
01:36:54,734 --> 01:36:56,531
Find a good hiding spot.

1225
01:36:56,769 --> 01:36:59,567
Do you have a favorite place to hide?

1226
01:37:00,506 --> 01:37:03,998
-The closet.
-In the closet? That's perfect.

1227
01:37:04,610 --> 01:37:08,478
Okay, open up the closet.
All right. Good, good.

1228
01:37:08,714 --> 01:37:10,909
Can you sit down in there?

1229
01:37:11,384 --> 01:37:15,411
All right. Now stay in here
and be very quiet.

1230
01:37:16,188 --> 01:37:18,452
I'll be right back. All right?

1231
01:37:45,985 --> 01:37:47,782
It's all good, baby.

1232
01:37:55,394 --> 01:37:56,952
You, against the wall.

1233
01:37:57,196 --> 01:38:00,461
Move real slow.
Put the money in that bag...

1234
01:38:00,700 --> 01:38:04,727
...take your weapons and place them
inside that pillowcase.

1235
01:38:06,739 --> 01:38:10,675
Congratulations, son. You made it.

1236
01:38:10,910 --> 01:38:13,174
You passed the test. You're a narc.

1237
01:38:13,412 --> 01:38:16,870
Put the gun down before you give
her a heart attack.

1238
01:38:17,116 --> 01:38:19,516
I said put the money in that bag.

1239
01:38:19,752 --> 01:38:22,846
Place your weapons
inside that pillowcase.

1240
01:38:23,089 --> 01:38:26,081
Fuck your appointment
with the Russians.

1241
01:38:26,325 --> 01:38:28,418
Oh, okay.

1242
01:38:29,462 --> 01:38:31,794
Okay. Hand me the pillowcase, baby.

1243
01:38:32,531 --> 01:38:34,624
Baby! Hand me the pillowcase.

1244
01:38:35,367 --> 01:38:36,834
You're gonna book me?

1245
01:38:37,269 --> 01:38:38,759
You smoked the dust.

1246
01:38:39,004 --> 01:38:42,906
You ran out, and you're the one
that shot Roger.

1247
01:38:44,477 --> 01:38:47,446
-Here you go.
-And the one on your ankle?

1248
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:50,708
Want the one in my back pocket too?

1249
01:38:54,587 --> 01:38:56,953
One problem: You got no witnesses.

1250
01:38:57,189 --> 01:39:00,955
Who are your witnesses, huh?
Roger? Smiley?

1251
01:39:01,193 --> 01:39:02,888
You think they'll help you?

1252
01:39:03,562 --> 01:39:08,158
It's not what you know.
It's what you can prove.

1253
01:39:11,937 --> 01:39:14,735
What can you prove, huh? Nothing.

1254
01:39:14,974 --> 01:39:17,067
-Where's your evidence?
-There.

1255
01:39:20,780 --> 01:39:21,872
Oh, shit!

1256
01:39:27,052 --> 01:39:29,043
It's on now, Jake.

1257
01:39:30,322 --> 01:39:31,721
Don't move.

1258
01:39:34,393 --> 01:39:36,054
Where you at, Jake?

1259
01:39:37,029 --> 01:39:38,087
Come on out, dog!

1260
01:39:51,544 --> 01:39:54,741
-Ah! I see you.
-Shit!

1261
01:40:00,719 --> 01:40:04,086
I'm surgical with this bitch.
How you want it?

1262
01:40:04,323 --> 01:40:08,589
That fool in the wheelchair?
How you think he got there?

1263
01:40:11,197 --> 01:40:14,223
-Mommy.
-Alonzito!

1264
01:40:17,203 --> 01:40:18,465
You see what I see?

1265
01:40:19,471 --> 01:40:23,601
Officer Hoyt, job number one:
Preserve life.

1266
01:40:23,843 --> 01:40:26,539
There's my son. Don't hurt him.

1267
01:40:26,779 --> 01:40:28,940
We're walking out together.

1268
01:40:47,733 --> 01:40:50,634
Alonzito! Alonzito!

1269
01:40:55,574 --> 01:40:57,769
-You all right?
-I want my mommy.

1270
01:40:58,010 --> 01:40:59,534
I know, I know, I know.

1271
01:40:59,778 --> 01:41:02,212
Just sit tight, all right?

1272
01:41:02,448 --> 01:41:06,145
It's gonna be all right. I know.

1273
01:41:07,319 --> 01:41:09,219
Shut the fuck up!

1274
01:41:12,024 --> 01:41:15,221
All right, let me see your hands!
Where is he?

1275
01:41:16,028 --> 01:41:17,586
-The window.
-Come on!

1276
01:41:17,830 --> 01:41:20,128
-Get your kid, stay down.
-Alonzito!

1277
01:46:22,501 --> 01:46:24,401
Hey, man, you tripping?

1278
01:46:24,770 --> 01:46:27,830
It's no fun when the rabbit
has the gun, is it?

1279
01:46:29,541 --> 01:46:31,065
My nigga.

1280
01:46:34,112 --> 01:46:38,242
Hey, first Damu puts one
in his head...

1281
01:46:39,885 --> 01:46:41,910
...I'll make you a rich man!

1282
01:46:42,988 --> 01:46:44,421
Come on now.

1283
01:46:44,656 --> 01:46:45,850
Who wanna get paid?

1284
01:46:47,759 --> 01:46:49,226
Who wanna get paid?

1285
01:46:53,232 --> 01:46:54,893
They're not like you.

1286
01:46:55,968 --> 01:46:58,198
You know what I learned today?

1287
01:46:58,904 --> 01:47:03,102
-I'm not like you.
-That's good. I'm glad to hear that.

1288
01:47:04,543 --> 01:47:08,343
Good. So, what now? Huh?

1289
01:47:09,448 --> 01:47:11,279
What you gonna do, shoot me?

1290
01:47:11,516 --> 01:47:14,383
You gonna bust your cherry
killing a cop?

1291
01:47:20,259 --> 01:47:21,783
There it is, Jake.

1292
01:47:23,662 --> 01:47:24,629
Hit me.

1293
01:47:26,031 --> 01:47:30,331
You never killed nobody before.
It ain't like stepping on ants.

1294
01:47:30,869 --> 01:47:32,530
Takes a man to kill.

1295
01:47:34,273 --> 01:47:36,298
Are you man enough to kill?

1296
01:47:38,710 --> 01:47:39,938
Hit me right there.

1297
01:47:44,416 --> 01:47:48,352
Get me, Jake. Get me.
Hit me. Hit me.

1298
01:47:48,587 --> 01:47:53,286
You can't do it.
Somebody drop this fool for me.

1299
01:48:10,275 --> 01:48:14,268
You got us twisted.
You got to put your own work in.

1300
01:48:15,547 --> 01:48:19,278
-All right. It's like that, Bone?
-It's like that.

1301
01:48:23,121 --> 01:48:26,648
Player to player, pimp to pimp.

1302
01:48:26,892 --> 01:48:29,759
-I don't believe you'd shoot me.
-Don't do it.

1303
01:48:31,063 --> 01:48:34,089
-Don't.
-I don't believe you got it in you.

1304
01:48:44,976 --> 01:48:47,945
I'm gonna get that gun and that money.

1305
01:48:48,180 --> 01:48:50,148
You ain't gonna do a thing.

1306
01:48:50,382 --> 01:48:53,613
You ain't gonna shoot no cop
in the back.

1307
01:48:54,586 --> 01:48:56,986
-Don't do it.
-You know what you'd get?

1308
01:48:57,255 --> 01:49:00,554
The gas chamber.
You know what it smells like?

1309
01:49:00,792 --> 01:49:05,126
Pine oil. That's where you headed,
to pine oil heaven.

1310
01:49:05,364 --> 01:49:07,889
I'm gonna get that gun and that money.

1311
01:49:08,133 --> 01:49:11,660
I don't think you got it in you.
I'm gonna go get it.

1312
01:49:13,271 --> 01:49:17,173
Shit! Ah, you motherfucker!

1313
01:49:17,642 --> 01:49:19,610
The next one will kill you.

1314
01:49:19,845 --> 01:49:23,076
Son of a bitch!
You shot me in the ass!

1315
01:49:23,315 --> 01:49:24,805
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

1316
01:49:25,050 --> 01:49:26,517
Okay, okay.

1317
01:49:26,752 --> 01:49:30,483
All right. Come on, I need
the money. Give me the money.

1318
01:49:31,356 --> 01:49:34,348
-Give me that money!
-It's not gonna happen.

1319
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:37,851
You gonna take my own money from me?

1320
01:49:38,096 --> 01:49:41,759
That's my evidence.
You wanna go to jail or go home?

1321
01:49:44,536 --> 01:49:46,128
I wanna go home, Jake.

1322
01:49:48,073 --> 01:49:50,974
Give me the money,
and let me go home.

1323
01:49:51,209 --> 01:49:54,303
-You wanna go home?
-Yeah, let me go home, Jake.

1324
01:49:54,546 --> 01:49:56,741
Give me the money,
and let me go.

1325
01:49:58,383 --> 01:50:01,375
Give me the money,
and let me go home, Jake.

1326
01:50:01,620 --> 01:50:03,087
That's right, come on.

1327
01:50:06,558 --> 01:50:08,287
You don't deserve this.

1328
01:50:09,761 --> 01:50:11,092
Okay, motherfucker.

1329
01:50:16,902 --> 01:50:18,767
Jake, go and bounce, homey.

1330
01:50:19,004 --> 01:50:22,030
Get up out of here. We got your back.

1331
01:50:23,108 --> 01:50:24,166
What?

1332
01:50:24,476 --> 01:50:27,104
-It's like that.
-Oh, no, you didn't!

1333
01:50:27,345 --> 01:50:31,008
Wait a minute! No, you--
Hey, hey, Jake!

1334
01:50:31,249 --> 01:50:34,741
Hey! Jake! Jake!

1335
01:50:34,986 --> 01:50:36,954
Jake, come back here!

1336
01:50:38,390 --> 01:50:39,516
Jake!

1337
01:50:42,160 --> 01:50:45,425
You disloyal, fool-ass,
bitch-made punk.

1338
01:50:47,666 --> 01:50:49,497
I need my money!

1339
01:50:52,003 --> 01:50:53,402
Jake!

1340
01:50:56,341 --> 01:51:00,141
Oh, you motherfuckers! Okay.

1341
01:51:00,479 --> 01:51:04,040
All right! I'm putting cases
on all you bitches!

1342
01:51:04,282 --> 01:51:07,615
Huh? You think you can do this shit?
Jake!

1343
01:51:08,487 --> 01:51:10,819
You think you can do this to me?!

1344
01:51:11,790 --> 01:51:15,749
You motherfuckers will be playing
basketball in Pelican Bay...

1345
01:51:15,994 --> 01:51:18,292
...when I get finished with you!

1346
01:51:18,897 --> 01:51:20,990
Shoe program, nigga!

1347
01:51:21,700 --> 01:51:23,930
Twenty-three hour lock-down!

1348
01:51:24,169 --> 01:51:26,228
I'm the man up in this piece!

1349
01:51:26,972 --> 01:51:29,941
Who you think you fucking with?!

1350
01:51:30,175 --> 01:51:34,839
I'm the police! I run shit here!
You just live here!

1351
01:51:36,014 --> 01:51:38,539
That's right, you better walk away.

1352
01:51:38,783 --> 01:51:41,445
I'm gonna burn this motherfucker down!

1353
01:51:42,053 --> 01:51:45,819
King Kong ain't got shit on me!

1354
01:51:57,602 --> 01:52:00,366
That's all right. That's all right.

1355
01:52:00,605 --> 01:52:02,630
Shit, I don't fuck--

1356
01:52:02,874 --> 01:52:06,105
I'm winning anyway. I'm winning.

1357
01:52:07,078 --> 01:52:09,911
I'm winning anyway. I can't lose.

1358
01:52:10,415 --> 01:52:14,647
Shit, you can shoot me,
but you can't kill me.

1359
01:52:20,759 --> 01:52:23,091
Oh, what a day.

1360
01:52:23,328 --> 01:52:25,421
What a motherfucking day!

1361
01:55:23,174 --> 01:55:26,575
<i>An L.A. police officer
was killed today...</i>

1362
01:55:26,811 --> 01:55:29,405
