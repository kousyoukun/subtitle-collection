1
00:01:21,602 --> 00:01:23,270
It's time.

2
00:01:25,272 --> 00:01:26,815
Hey there...

3
00:01:27,024 --> 00:01:30,736
...good morning. How are you today?

4
00:01:30,945 --> 00:01:33,280
Hey. What are you doing up?

5
00:01:33,489 --> 00:01:34,490
Moo.

6
00:01:36,242 --> 00:01:37,743
Is that Daddy?

7
00:01:41,622 --> 00:01:43,916
Hey there, cowgirl.

8
00:01:44,917 --> 00:01:47,503
She's a little feisty today.

9
00:01:48,504 --> 00:01:50,631
Babies should be sleeping.

10
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:54,468
"I'm too hungry for my own good."
Yes.

11
00:01:58,305 --> 00:01:59,807
I gotta get ready.

12
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:08,524
Wrong day to be forgetting stuff.

13
00:02:08,816 --> 00:02:11,986
You know how lucky you are.
Don't screw this up.

14
00:02:12,194 --> 00:02:14,154
All right! Jesus.

15
00:02:15,114 --> 00:02:18,325
- She go back to sleep?
- Yes. Ate like a pig.

16
00:02:18,534 --> 00:02:23,873
I know I'm lucky. I ace this job,
the department's wide open.

17
00:02:24,165 --> 00:02:28,669
Get my own division someday.
You should see their houses.

18
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:36,886
Hello?

19
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:41,640
Well, yes.

20
00:02:42,641 --> 00:02:44,059
Don't worry, I will.

21
00:02:44,685 --> 00:02:47,188
He's right here.
<i>It's Alonzo.</i>

22
00:02:54,111 --> 00:02:55,154
- Hello.
<i>- Hoyt?</i>

23
00:02:55,362 --> 00:02:56,405
Yes, sir.

24
00:02:56,614 --> 00:02:59,325
<i>- Going to roll call?</i>
- I'm leaving now.

25
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:00,618
<i>- Hoyt?</i>
- Yes, sir?

26
00:03:00,826 --> 00:03:04,413
<i>- Fairies go to roll call. We don't.</i>
- Good to know.

27
00:03:04,622 --> 00:03:07,791
<i>There's a coffee shop on 7th.</i>
<i>Be there at 10.</i>

28
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,545
<i>Be in comfortable shoes.</i>
<i>Got a backup gun?</i>

29
00:03:11,754 --> 00:03:15,549
- Only the standard issue Beretta.
<i>- Bring it. Cuffs too.</i>

30
00:03:15,758 --> 00:03:19,220
<i>Maybe we'll do some business.</i>
<i>We're aggressive.</i>

31
00:03:19,428 --> 00:03:24,099
I know. That's why I signed up.
I want to thank you for this--

32
00:03:33,567 --> 00:03:34,944
What's wrong?

33
00:03:37,696 --> 00:03:39,615
Feels like football tryouts.

34
00:03:39,824 --> 00:03:43,786
I wish it was tomorrow
so I'd know if I made the squad.

35
00:03:43,994 --> 00:03:46,747
Listen, it's not tomorrow, it's today.

36
00:03:47,414 --> 00:03:50,751
- I know it's gonna work out.
- You do?

37
00:04:14,066 --> 00:04:15,568
Good morning, sir.

38
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:21,282
No, thank you, ma'am.

39
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,951
Get some chow in you.
My dollar.

40
00:04:24,493 --> 00:04:26,453
Thank you, sir, but I ate.

41
00:04:26,662 --> 00:04:27,955
Fine. Don't.

42
00:04:34,628 --> 00:04:36,255
It's nice here.

43
00:04:37,631 --> 00:04:38,674
May I read?

44
00:04:39,425 --> 00:04:41,594
- I'm sorry, sir. I--
- Thank you.

45
00:04:42,219 --> 00:04:46,223
- I'll get something to eat.
- Hell, no you won't. You fucked up.

46
00:04:46,473 --> 00:04:49,059
I'm trying to read. Please shut up.

47
00:05:08,537 --> 00:05:12,291
I'll like not being in a hot
black and white all summer.

48
00:05:17,296 --> 00:05:19,507
Tell me a story, Hoyt.

49
00:05:21,008 --> 00:05:24,470
- Like my story?
- Not your story, a story.

50
00:05:25,137 --> 00:05:29,266
Since you can't shut up
so I can read, tell me a story.

51
00:05:29,517 --> 00:05:31,644
- I don't know any.
- You don't?

52
00:05:31,852 --> 00:05:33,395
- No.
- I'll tell you one.

53
00:05:33,687 --> 00:05:37,900
This is a newspaper, right?
It's 90 percent bullshit.

54
00:05:38,108 --> 00:05:40,653
But it's entertaining. So I read it.

55
00:05:40,861 --> 00:05:45,574
It entertains me. You won't let me
read it, so you entertain me.

56
00:05:45,825 --> 00:05:47,868
Tell me a story now. Go.

57
00:05:48,452 --> 00:05:51,372
- There was a DUI stop.
- A DUI stop?

58
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,249
Let me load up!

59
00:05:53,457 --> 00:05:56,460
- A DUI? Oh, shit!
- Well, I--

60
00:05:56,669 --> 00:05:59,672
- Listen, we were on midwatch--
- We who?

61
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,842
- Oh, me and Debbie.
- Who's Debbie?

62
00:06:03,801 --> 00:06:06,220
Debbie Maxwell, my training officer.

63
00:06:06,887 --> 00:06:09,640
- A female training officer?
- Yes, sir.

64
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:13,060
Okay. All right.

65
00:06:13,269 --> 00:06:14,937
Was she black, white?

66
00:06:15,145 --> 00:06:16,522
She was white.

67
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,942
- Lick-her license?
- A what?

68
00:06:20,276 --> 00:06:23,529
A lick-her license.
Was she a dyke, a lesbian?

69
00:06:24,238 --> 00:06:27,032
- ls she any good?
- She's pretty good.

70
00:06:27,241 --> 00:06:29,660
- Okay, Debbie, midwatch. Go.
- Right.

71
00:06:29,869 --> 00:06:31,954
- It was a quiet night--
- Boom!

72
00:06:32,163 --> 00:06:36,083
- What the fuck?
- You never know, that's the point. Go.

73
00:06:36,292 --> 00:06:38,794
It was quiet and we're rolling...

74
00:06:39,044 --> 00:06:42,548
...l'm driving. This Acura,
just a beautiful car...

75
00:06:42,756 --> 00:06:47,469
...comes out a side street, all over
the median. I hit the wailer.

76
00:06:47,678 --> 00:06:50,931
He drives for 10 blocks
before he pulls over.

77
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:54,059
Plates run clean,
so I test and arrest.

78
00:06:54,268 --> 00:06:57,563
I'm belting in our unit,
and she's tossing his car.

79
00:06:57,813 --> 00:07:02,526
She shows me a .38
and two loaded shotguns.

80
00:07:02,735 --> 00:07:05,279
- No shit?
- No shit! So...

81
00:07:05,487 --> 00:07:09,325
...she calls and I'm searching.
I find 500 grams of meth.

82
00:07:09,533 --> 00:07:12,453
Turns out he's on bail
for distribution...

83
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:16,290
...on his way to smoke
his ex-partner before trial.

84
00:07:16,499 --> 00:07:17,541
Boom.

85
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:21,295
- Prevented a murder.
- You got him. It's amazing.

86
00:07:22,046 --> 00:07:24,423
It is. That you're out there...

87
00:07:24,632 --> 00:07:29,803
...with a fine bitch for a year and
the best story you can tell me...

88
00:07:30,054 --> 00:07:31,764
...is a drunk stop.

89
00:07:34,808 --> 00:07:39,522
But I don't believe you.
You tapped that ass, didn't you?

90
00:07:41,357 --> 00:07:44,360
Tell the truth.
You know you tapped that ass.

91
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,487
In the back, bam! Code X.

92
00:07:46,987 --> 00:07:49,448
- I got a wife.
- You got a dick.

93
00:07:51,325 --> 00:07:53,327
- You do have one, don't you?
- Yes.

94
00:07:53,536 --> 00:07:57,998
Your dick lines up straight.
Right and left of it are pockets.

95
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:02,419
In those pockets are money.
Look in either one. Pay the bill.

96
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,598
Grab that menu off that window for me.

97
00:08:21,689 --> 00:08:23,399
Get in, it's unlocked.

98
00:08:28,904 --> 00:08:31,240
Throw that in the glove box.

99
00:08:31,448 --> 00:08:35,369
- This is not from the motor pool.
- No. Sexy, though, huh?

100
00:08:36,036 --> 00:08:40,708
- Where's the office, at division?
- You're in the office.

101
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,587
Going up.

102
00:09:09,612 --> 00:09:11,447
Today is a training day.

103
00:09:12,364 --> 00:09:14,783
Give you a taste of the business.

104
00:09:15,201 --> 00:09:17,578
I got 38 cases pending trial...

105
00:09:17,786 --> 00:09:21,040
...63 active investigations,
250 I can't clear.

106
00:09:21,415 --> 00:09:24,418
I supervise five officers.
Five personalities.

107
00:09:24,627 --> 00:09:27,379
Five sets of problems.
You could be six.

108
00:09:27,588 --> 00:09:29,965
I ain't holding no hands.

109
00:09:30,174 --> 00:09:33,177
You got today to show me
what you're made of.

110
00:09:33,636 --> 00:09:37,431
You don't like Narcotics,
get the fuck out of my car...

111
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,768
...get a job chasing bad checks.
You hear me?

112
00:09:40,976 --> 00:09:42,520
- I hear you.
- Okay.

113
00:09:45,397 --> 00:09:47,149
Why do you want to be a narc?

114
00:09:47,441 --> 00:09:51,946
To serve my community by ridding
it of dangerous drugs.

115
00:09:52,154 --> 00:09:53,989
Right, but why a narc?

116
00:09:56,367 --> 00:09:58,118
I want to make detective.

117
00:09:58,327 --> 00:10:00,204
Stick with me, you can do it.

118
00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:02,832
Unlearn that academy shit.

119
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,918
Don't bring that here.
It'll get you killed.

120
00:10:06,126 --> 00:10:08,504
I'll do anything you want me to do.

121
00:10:11,549 --> 00:10:13,217
My nigga.

122
00:10:13,634 --> 00:10:16,178
Roll your window down. Start there.

123
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:21,934
- Got to hear it, smell it, taste it.
- Right.

124
00:10:22,685 --> 00:10:24,395
How's your "Espanol"?

125
00:10:25,896 --> 00:10:27,147
Learn that shit.

126
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,608
That will get you killed.

127
00:10:29,817 --> 00:10:32,945
They plot all kinds of shit
behind your back.

128
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,533
You gonna teach me that
old-school Rodney King shit?

129
00:10:37,741 --> 00:10:40,452
We don't roll like that no more.

130
00:10:40,661 --> 00:10:41,996
Now we use this.

131
00:10:42,204 --> 00:10:44,290
These niggas are too strong.

132
00:10:44,498 --> 00:10:47,751
- Think I'm crazy?
- I don't know what to think.

133
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,670
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

134
00:10:50,254 --> 00:10:51,463
Good.

135
00:10:56,135 --> 00:10:57,136
Good.

136
00:11:07,188 --> 00:11:08,522
Been married long?

137
00:11:08,731 --> 00:11:10,482
- About a year.
- Yeah?

138
00:11:10,691 --> 00:11:13,569
- You got a kid?
- A girl, 9 months.

139
00:11:14,361 --> 00:11:17,489
I got four. Boys.

140
00:11:17,698 --> 00:11:21,035
You need a son,
I'll hook your lady up. Can't miss.

141
00:11:22,244 --> 00:11:26,373
Can we not talk
about my family, all right?

142
00:11:26,582 --> 00:11:27,583
I respect that.

143
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:31,128
I'm married, I got my queen too.

144
00:11:31,587 --> 00:11:33,797
I remember having a young bride.

145
00:11:34,048 --> 00:11:37,259
You probably fuck her face-to-face,
don't you?

146
00:11:37,468 --> 00:11:39,136
Let's not talk about her.

147
00:11:39,386 --> 00:11:43,098
That's my point. You're so in love,
it's coming right out.

148
00:11:43,599 --> 00:11:46,227
The day you bring
that here is the day...

149
00:11:46,435 --> 00:11:50,189
...you don't make it back.
Hide it deep inside of you.

150
00:11:50,397 --> 00:11:52,775
The maggots out here
will find it...

151
00:11:52,983 --> 00:11:55,611
...use it against you
and chew you up.

152
00:11:55,819 --> 00:11:58,113
Never wear the ring to work.

153
00:11:59,448 --> 00:12:01,742
- I'm serious about that.
- Thanks.

154
00:12:33,482 --> 00:12:34,859
What's here?

155
00:12:37,152 --> 00:12:38,320
Transactions.

156
00:12:39,613 --> 00:12:44,285
You see that guy trying to act
like he's not slanging dope?

157
00:12:44,535 --> 00:12:47,580
- Yeah.
- That's my boy.

158
00:12:47,788 --> 00:12:50,332
That's my boy, Neto.

159
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:52,793
Only 17, but he can kill.

160
00:12:53,502 --> 00:12:55,629
- Works for me.
- He's an informer?

161
00:12:55,838 --> 00:12:57,923
Teammate. I got eyes everywhere.

162
00:12:58,132 --> 00:13:03,262
He gets to make some cash.
Lets me know when big things happen.

163
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,347
Big transactions.

164
00:13:08,976 --> 00:13:11,270
- You trust him?
- Damn right I do.

165
00:13:11,478 --> 00:13:15,941
Sprung his mom from INS detention.
Here we go. Watch this.

166
00:13:18,152 --> 00:13:22,656
That's right. Come on down.

167
00:13:22,865 --> 00:13:26,118
Come on. Look at it. Sexy, ain't it?

168
00:13:27,536 --> 00:13:29,038
That's right.

169
00:13:30,414 --> 00:13:32,666
- See the hand-to-hand?
- I saw it.

170
00:13:32,917 --> 00:13:36,170
- When was your last felony stop?
- Two weeks ago.

171
00:13:36,378 --> 00:13:37,463
You need practice.

172
00:13:37,671 --> 00:13:41,008
- College kids.
- They'll get an education today.

173
00:13:41,217 --> 00:13:44,345
I want them grabbing glass.
You take the back.

174
00:13:44,553 --> 00:13:47,306
Stay off of the Rover.

175
00:13:47,556 --> 00:13:48,974
Let's go.

176
00:13:53,229 --> 00:13:56,315
- You little fuckers.
- Run, baby, run.

177
00:14:09,745 --> 00:14:12,039
Police! Let's see your hands!

178
00:14:12,248 --> 00:14:13,999
Put them up! Put them up!

179
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:16,752
Put your hands on the windshield!

180
00:14:16,961 --> 00:14:21,549
- Put your hands on the glass.
- Driver, put it in park!

181
00:14:21,757 --> 00:14:25,928
- It's a stick shift!
- Throw the keys out the window!

182
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:28,514
Put your hands on your chest!

183
00:14:30,432 --> 00:14:32,643
All right, fork it over.

184
00:14:32,852 --> 00:14:34,019
- What?
- You know.

185
00:14:34,228 --> 00:14:36,856
The marijuana. Give it to me!

186
00:14:37,064 --> 00:14:39,191
- Give it!
- Sorry, sir.

187
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:44,196
- Shut up! Give me that pipe.
- My mom gave me that pipe.

188
00:14:44,405 --> 00:14:48,742
She can pick it up in jail.
Give me the cigarettes too.

189
00:14:48,993 --> 00:14:52,329
- Control your suspect!
- Palms on the glass!

190
00:14:52,538 --> 00:14:57,585
Move the hands, I'll slap you!
Face against the glass! Right there!

191
00:14:59,253 --> 00:15:01,839
You know this is a gang neighborhood?

192
00:15:02,464 --> 00:15:05,843
- Yeah!
- Then don't come down here.

193
00:15:06,051 --> 00:15:10,764
I see you down here again,
I'll make you walk home.

194
00:15:11,015 --> 00:15:15,186
I'll let the homeboys run
a train on her. Know what that is?

195
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,563
Yes, sir.

196
00:15:17,771 --> 00:15:22,484
All right, gentlemen.
Thanks for your cooperation.

197
00:15:23,194 --> 00:15:26,113
Let's go. Safe your iron, son.

198
00:15:27,907 --> 00:15:29,116
Shit!

199
00:15:39,793 --> 00:15:41,420
I like that shit.

200
00:15:41,629 --> 00:15:44,715
I like how you move.
You were trained well.

201
00:15:44,924 --> 00:15:49,887
Check that out. It's a bad dime.
See the hairs, undeveloped seeds.

202
00:15:50,095 --> 00:15:52,014
You see how immature it is.

203
00:15:52,223 --> 00:15:54,642
That's classic Mexican garbage.

204
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:57,853
Let me see. It's old.
Probably last year's.

205
00:15:58,479 --> 00:15:59,605
To be truly effective...

206
00:15:59,813 --> 00:16:04,944
...a good narcotics agent
must know and love narcotics.

207
00:16:05,194 --> 00:16:07,780
A good narcotics agent should have...

208
00:16:07,988 --> 00:16:10,157
...narcotics in his blood.

209
00:16:11,617 --> 00:16:14,495
- What, you gonna smoke that?
- No, you are.

210
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:18,290
- Hell if I am!
- Yes.

211
00:16:18,749 --> 00:16:20,209
- You're not?
- No.

212
00:16:20,417 --> 00:16:23,170
- Why? You a Mormon?
- I'm not losing my job.

213
00:16:23,379 --> 00:16:24,547
This is your job.

214
00:16:24,755 --> 00:16:26,298
- Smoke it.
- No.

215
00:16:26,507 --> 00:16:28,509
This ain't a test. Take a hit.

216
00:16:29,802 --> 00:16:33,639
Listen, I became a cop
to stop people from using--

217
00:16:35,015 --> 00:16:38,352
- That ain't cocaine. Take a hit.
- No, man.

218
00:16:42,106 --> 00:16:44,775
- Jesus Christ!
- Yeah, right.

219
00:16:45,442 --> 00:16:47,695
If I was a dealer, you'd be dead!

220
00:16:47,945 --> 00:16:51,490
Turn shit down out here,
and your wife gets a flag.

221
00:16:51,699 --> 00:16:53,242
What's wrong with you?

222
00:16:54,869 --> 00:16:56,036
You know what?

223
00:16:56,245 --> 00:17:01,333
I don't want you in my unit.
Get the fuck out of my car, rookie.

224
00:17:03,377 --> 00:17:04,378
Poo butt-ass.

225
00:17:08,215 --> 00:17:11,886
- What's the holdup?
- Move it!

226
00:17:12,094 --> 00:17:13,512
Give me that thing.

227
00:17:14,305 --> 00:17:16,473
I'll smoke it. Give it to me.

228
00:17:18,851 --> 00:17:20,769
You want me to, I'll smoke it.

229
00:17:33,199 --> 00:17:37,369
Virgin lungs. Man up now.
Man up, nigga. Man up.

230
00:17:37,745 --> 00:17:38,913
Go ahead. Get it.

231
00:17:39,121 --> 00:17:42,625
- Come on!
- Shut the fuck up and just wait!

232
00:17:50,633 --> 00:17:53,969
- Man the fuck up! Finish that shit!
- Geronimo.

233
00:17:58,974 --> 00:18:01,060
Let's go, nigga. Let's go.

234
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:55,614
Oh, shit!

235
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:08,377
You okay, kid?

236
00:19:08,627 --> 00:19:13,382
That's a man size hit you took.
When's the last time you smoked weed?

237
00:19:14,967 --> 00:19:17,052
The last-- Twelfth grade.

238
00:19:17,469 --> 00:19:19,054
We were....

239
00:19:20,347 --> 00:19:22,892
- Well, we were....
- Smoking weed.

240
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,602
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

241
00:19:26,896 --> 00:19:29,940
Left that out of your service jacket.

242
00:19:30,149 --> 00:19:33,319
I know you got secrets.
Everybody got secrets.

243
00:19:33,527 --> 00:19:37,656
- Didn't know you liked it wet, though.
- What's wet?

244
00:19:37,907 --> 00:19:43,037
Butt-naked. Ill. Sherm. Dust.

245
00:19:43,245 --> 00:19:47,958
PCP. Primos. P-dog.

246
00:19:48,501 --> 00:19:50,252
That's what you had.

247
00:19:51,045 --> 00:19:52,922
You couldn't taste it?

248
00:19:55,216 --> 00:19:58,552
- I never done it.
- I haven't, but you have now.

249
00:20:04,934 --> 00:20:06,477
Shit!

250
00:20:06,894 --> 00:20:10,064
Shit. I'll get piss-tested,
and I'll get fired.

251
00:20:10,314 --> 00:20:13,317
The boss has our back.
We know before we piss.

252
00:20:15,611 --> 00:20:17,905
- Shit!
- Boom!

253
00:20:18,113 --> 00:20:19,573
Why did you do this?

254
00:20:19,782 --> 00:20:22,535
You're an adult.
Nobody made you smoke.

255
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:25,788
You made a decision. Live with it.

256
00:20:27,456 --> 00:20:29,750
Not like I put a gun to your head.

257
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,965
Man....

258
00:20:50,145 --> 00:20:54,316
- Oh, man, shit.
- Come on, get your shit together now.

259
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,902
This is my dog's house.

260
00:20:57,152 --> 00:20:59,446
We'll see what he thinks of you.

261
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:14,170
- Get your ass in here!
- Roger, what's up?

262
00:21:14,378 --> 00:21:16,964
- How are they treating you?
- All right.

263
00:21:17,173 --> 00:21:20,050
- I didn't wake you up?
- I never sleep.

264
00:21:20,259 --> 00:21:22,386
Right. This my new guy, Jake.

265
00:21:22,595 --> 00:21:24,180
Come on. Get in here.

266
00:21:24,388 --> 00:21:27,933
Yeah. Time to get my swerve on here!

267
00:21:28,142 --> 00:21:30,561
- What you drinking?
- The best.

268
00:21:30,769 --> 00:21:33,689
The best, I know. Best for the best.

269
00:21:34,148 --> 00:21:37,860
I heard about Vegas.
Got a green light on your ass.

270
00:21:38,068 --> 00:21:39,612
No problem.

271
00:21:39,862 --> 00:21:42,364
Russians want you. I got your back.

272
00:21:42,656 --> 00:21:44,742
I know that. Thank you.

273
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:50,581
Here. Get that medicine up in you.

274
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:56,003
- Back to the world.
- Back to the world.

275
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,177
Went and got yourself
a daisy-fresh rookie.

276
00:22:10,434 --> 00:22:14,605
He's high as a motherfucker.
What did you give him?

277
00:22:14,813 --> 00:22:17,399
- A little of Mexico's finest.
- Yeah.

278
00:22:22,446 --> 00:22:23,864
Garbage.

279
00:22:24,657 --> 00:22:27,243
- Where'd you grow up?
- North Hollywood.

280
00:22:27,451 --> 00:22:29,411
- What's your last name?
- Hoyt.

281
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:33,707
Hoyt. Hoyt....

282
00:22:34,792 --> 00:22:38,045
- Strong safety, North Hollywood High.
- Right.

283
00:22:39,171 --> 00:22:41,632
- How'd you know that?
- How did you?

284
00:22:42,174 --> 00:22:45,845
- I follow all the good players.
- No doubt.

285
00:22:46,053 --> 00:22:48,806
Excuse me. Shit.

286
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:53,394
- Strong safety, huh?
- It's me. What's up?

287
00:22:54,478 --> 00:22:58,858
I can't do anything.
Clean up your own mess. Don't call me.

288
00:22:59,692 --> 00:23:04,113
Hey! Here's a joke, boy.

289
00:23:04,738 --> 00:23:09,869
Man walks out of his house,
sees this snail lying on his porch.

290
00:23:10,077 --> 00:23:13,956
So he picks it up,
chucks it into the backyard.

291
00:23:14,165 --> 00:23:18,627
Snail bounces off a rock,
busts its shell up all to shit...

292
00:23:18,878 --> 00:23:20,546
...lands in the grass.

293
00:23:20,754 --> 00:23:24,133
Snail lies there dying.

294
00:23:26,093 --> 00:23:27,261
But...

295
00:23:27,469 --> 00:23:30,639
...snail doesn't die.
Soon it can crawl again.

296
00:23:32,516 --> 00:23:33,601
And one day...

297
00:23:35,269 --> 00:23:38,606
...snail heads back
to the front of the house.

298
00:23:38,814 --> 00:23:42,902
Finally, after about a year...

299
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:46,197
...the little guy crawls
back on the porch.

300
00:23:46,405 --> 00:23:49,492
Right then the man walks
out of his house...

301
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:51,869
...sees this snail again.

302
00:23:52,077 --> 00:23:53,621
So he looks at it...

303
00:23:53,829 --> 00:23:55,664
...and he says:

304
00:23:58,042 --> 00:24:00,127
"The fuck's your problem?"

305
00:24:06,509 --> 00:24:08,594
That's not funny.

306
00:24:08,802 --> 00:24:11,013
What you laughing for then?

307
00:24:11,222 --> 00:24:14,642
- I don't know, man. I--
- Hey!

308
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:18,562
Figure that joke out,
you'll figure the streets out.

309
00:24:19,522 --> 00:24:23,025
Nothing to figure out.
It's senseless bullshit.

310
00:24:23,234 --> 00:24:27,655
- You know-- I already figured it out.
- Really?

311
00:24:27,863 --> 00:24:31,450
- Yeah.
- You already figured the streets out?

312
00:24:31,659 --> 00:24:35,496
Well, it's all about smiles and cries.

313
00:24:36,121 --> 00:24:39,166
- Put the drink down. What is that?
- Hold on!

314
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:41,043
Hold on. Smiles and cries.

315
00:24:41,293 --> 00:24:44,797
Smiles and cries.
Smiles and cries. I hear you.

316
00:24:45,464 --> 00:24:49,426
Yeah, you gotta control
your smiles and cries...

317
00:24:49,677 --> 00:24:53,889
...because that's all you have,
and nobody can take that away.

318
00:24:56,183 --> 00:24:58,143
Oh, shit.

319
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:08,153
What you think, dog? Think this
greenhorn can handle undercover?

320
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:14,034
You were just like him.
Same silly-ass look and everything.

321
00:25:14,243 --> 00:25:16,162
Saving the goddamn world.

322
00:25:17,204 --> 00:25:20,875
Now that's some smiles
and cries for your ass!

323
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:23,752
- That was you.
- Shit lasted a week.

324
00:25:24,587 --> 00:25:25,921
Gotta get back to it.

325
00:25:26,505 --> 00:25:27,840
Thanks for the snort.

326
00:25:28,048 --> 00:25:29,508
- Good to see you.
- Yeah.

327
00:25:29,717 --> 00:25:31,844
Yes, sir. What you doing later?

328
00:25:32,052 --> 00:25:34,013
Stay home. Save some cheddar.

329
00:25:34,221 --> 00:25:39,185
My dream's less than a year away.
Philippine Islands, here I come.

330
00:25:39,393 --> 00:25:41,395
- Let me go too.
- You're invited.

331
00:25:57,077 --> 00:26:02,333
Hey. Open your eyes, man.
You'll feel a lot better.

332
00:26:06,795 --> 00:26:09,798
Boom! Come on, man. Sit your ass up.

333
00:26:16,263 --> 00:26:17,264
Who are you?

334
00:26:19,767 --> 00:26:22,311
I'm the Zig-Zag man. Who are you?

335
00:26:22,561 --> 00:26:25,689
- I'm a cop. Watch out!
- Don't shoot nobody.

336
00:26:25,898 --> 00:26:28,317
Get that beer in you for ballast.

337
00:26:28,901 --> 00:26:32,279
- No, man.
- Get it in you. You'll feel better.

338
00:26:50,005 --> 00:26:51,006
Stop the car!

339
00:26:51,215 --> 00:26:53,217
Stop the car! I saw something!

340
00:26:53,425 --> 00:26:54,844
- Just relax.
- Stop!

341
00:26:55,052 --> 00:26:58,013
All right! Hold the fuck on-- Hey!

342
00:27:04,687 --> 00:27:06,939
Fuck me, man! Shit.

343
00:27:09,358 --> 00:27:12,111
Police officer!
Get away from the girl!

344
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:15,239
- I'm gonna fuck you too, cop!
- Get the--

345
00:27:49,023 --> 00:27:51,567
We didn't do shit! Bitch is crazy!

346
00:27:55,738 --> 00:27:58,574
Roll over, man. Roll the fuck over!

347
00:27:59,283 --> 00:28:00,576
Fucking ass prick!

348
00:28:04,788 --> 00:28:06,332
My nigga!

349
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:09,418
Go ahead, cowboy,
you got mad squabbles.

350
00:28:10,503 --> 00:28:13,714
- Thanks for the help.
- You should've shot them.

351
00:28:14,089 --> 00:28:15,257
What's happening?

352
00:28:15,466 --> 00:28:17,843
- You're dead!
- Okay! Wait! Hold it!

353
00:28:18,052 --> 00:28:19,970
- You too, white boy!
- Okay....

354
00:28:20,221 --> 00:28:23,432
- My cousins will blast you fools!
- Calm down.

355
00:28:23,641 --> 00:28:25,976
- Calm down. You okay?
- No, I'm not!

356
00:28:26,185 --> 00:28:28,187
- Look at my nose!
- I see it.

357
00:28:28,395 --> 00:28:32,191
Put ice on it. You'll be fine.
What're you doing here?

358
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,944
- I was just--
- They probably got AIDS.

359
00:28:35,152 --> 00:28:36,737
Why you not at school?

360
00:28:36,946 --> 00:28:39,240
I was going to a ditch party and--

361
00:28:39,448 --> 00:28:41,909
You almost became the ditch party.

362
00:28:42,117 --> 00:28:44,745
- Where your cousins from?
- Hillside "Trece"!

363
00:28:44,954 --> 00:28:48,666
- Remember that!
- Tell your cousins to get your back.

364
00:28:48,874 --> 00:28:51,085
Grab your bag and go home now.

365
00:28:51,293 --> 00:28:54,672
- No! I need a statement--
- Don't need no statement.

366
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,050
- They'll fuck you up.
- We gonna let them go?

367
00:28:58,259 --> 00:29:00,636
You wanna beat them up, go ahead.

368
00:29:00,886 --> 00:29:04,890
I got a punching bag at home.
They should be off the streets.

369
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:06,767
You hear that?

370
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,771
- Wanna go home or to jail?
- What you think?

371
00:29:12,773 --> 00:29:15,776
Got room at the booty house.
You been there?

372
00:29:17,778 --> 00:29:20,406
- You'll grab your ankles.
- Suck my dick!

373
00:29:20,614 --> 00:29:23,617
- I know people.
- That's how it starts.

374
00:29:23,868 --> 00:29:26,162
What about you? What you got?

375
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:27,955
- Got nothing?
- No.

376
00:29:28,164 --> 00:29:29,498
- You sure?
- Yeah.

377
00:29:29,707 --> 00:29:32,918
- Where's your horn?
- Got none.

378
00:29:35,963 --> 00:29:37,756
You got money, though.

379
00:29:37,965 --> 00:29:41,635
You lied to me!

380
00:29:42,761 --> 00:29:44,972
Lucky I don't make you eat that.

381
00:29:45,639 --> 00:29:49,810
Stand up, you. Stand the fuck up!

382
00:29:55,649 --> 00:29:57,860
Yeah. Oh, shit, huh?

383
00:30:05,701 --> 00:30:08,787
Turn around, sucker. Turn around.

384
00:30:10,372 --> 00:30:12,333
So you like raping girls?

385
00:30:13,959 --> 00:30:16,045
- Like to rape girls?
- No, man.

386
00:30:16,253 --> 00:30:18,339
- That's what you like?
- No....

387
00:30:19,924 --> 00:30:22,009
That what you like? Don't lie.

388
00:30:22,218 --> 00:30:25,679
Told me to suck your dick.
Is that what you said?

389
00:30:27,515 --> 00:30:28,682
Look at me.

390
00:30:29,683 --> 00:30:32,686
You wanted me
to suck your dick, right?

391
00:30:32,895 --> 00:30:35,105
Isn't that what you said?

392
00:30:35,314 --> 00:30:38,651
Didn't you say suck it?
Don't lie. Am I a liar?

393
00:30:38,901 --> 00:30:40,194
You didn't say that?

394
00:30:40,402 --> 00:30:44,031
That's not what you said?
So I'm lying?

395
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,535
- No, please!
- Where is it? I can't find it.

396
00:30:48,285 --> 00:30:50,037
Pull your pants down.

397
00:30:53,707 --> 00:30:56,961
Which nut you want?
I'll leave you one.

398
00:30:57,837 --> 00:31:01,131
Your choice. Just make a decision.

399
00:31:01,757 --> 00:31:05,469
All right.
Put your hands on your head.

400
00:31:07,263 --> 00:31:11,308
Close your eyes. Close your eyes.

401
00:31:15,896 --> 00:31:17,690
Lucky I got other business.

402
00:31:17,898 --> 00:31:23,445
I'd cut your fucking dick off
and stick it up your funky ass. Bitch.

403
00:31:23,654 --> 00:31:27,700
Damn! I'm thirsty.
I want a beer. What about you?

404
00:31:28,075 --> 00:31:29,577
You want a beer?

405
00:31:33,747 --> 00:31:36,083
I'm gonna leave you three to it.

406
00:31:42,256 --> 00:31:44,133
Pussy-ass bitch!

407
00:31:44,341 --> 00:31:47,094
I see you again, I'll fuck you up!

408
00:31:47,887 --> 00:31:49,763
You won't see shit coming!

409
00:31:49,972 --> 00:31:53,475
I'll dent your mouth,
I'll crack your head open.

410
00:31:53,684 --> 00:31:55,352
You fucking pig! Come on!

411
00:32:07,239 --> 00:32:10,075
- That girl's 14.
- She all woman, though.

412
00:32:10,284 --> 00:32:13,996
You tax that ass for days, man!
Keep walking, bitch!

413
00:32:25,132 --> 00:32:26,383
You want a beer?

414
00:32:27,718 --> 00:32:31,388
- No, I don't want a beer, man.
- No? You mad?

415
00:32:43,817 --> 00:32:45,778
Want to book that $60, huh?

416
00:32:45,986 --> 00:32:48,656
Here, go ahead, book it into evidence.

417
00:32:49,156 --> 00:32:51,408
Where the suspects? Go get them.

418
00:32:51,617 --> 00:32:53,327
You let them go.

419
00:32:53,536 --> 00:32:55,120
- I let them go?
- You did.

420
00:32:55,329 --> 00:32:58,499
You want to run and gun,
stay in Patrol.

421
00:32:58,749 --> 00:33:00,626
This is Investigations.

422
00:33:00,876 --> 00:33:02,670
Garbage men handle garbage.

423
00:33:02,878 --> 00:33:05,631
Professional anglers
go after the big fish.

424
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,342
Chasing them crackhead
motherfuckers....

425
00:33:08,551 --> 00:33:11,220
- They'd have killed you.
- They belong in jail.

426
00:33:11,428 --> 00:33:14,014
Why? They got beaten,
lost their money.

427
00:33:14,348 --> 00:33:17,685
Hillside's "eses" will smoke them.
What more you want?

428
00:33:17,935 --> 00:33:19,895
- I want justice.
- That's not justice?

429
00:33:20,354 --> 00:33:22,064
- That's street justice.
- So?

430
00:33:22,273 --> 00:33:24,608
- Let them kill each other?
- God willing.

431
00:33:24,984 --> 00:33:27,194
Fuck them!
Everybody looking like them.

432
00:33:27,403 --> 00:33:29,446
Reality is, the good guys...

433
00:33:29,655 --> 00:33:32,867
...they die first.
The school kids and moms...

434
00:33:33,117 --> 00:33:36,453
...family men, don't want to catch
any bullets.

435
00:33:36,662 --> 00:33:40,249
To protect the sheep,
you got to catch the wolf.

436
00:33:40,457 --> 00:33:43,335
It takes a wolf to catch a wolf,
understand?

437
00:33:43,627 --> 00:33:44,587
What?

438
00:33:44,795 --> 00:33:47,840
- Protect the sheep by killing wolves.
- I heard you.

439
00:33:48,048 --> 00:33:50,843
- You didn't hear me.
- All right. Whatever.

440
00:33:51,051 --> 00:33:52,803
Whatever the fuck-ever!

441
00:34:05,149 --> 00:34:09,403
Do you ever lock anybody up?
You seem busy keeping people out.

442
00:34:09,612 --> 00:34:11,238
You don't know shit!

443
00:34:11,447 --> 00:34:14,950
Shit, they build jails because of me!

444
00:34:15,242 --> 00:34:19,371
Judges gave over 15,000 man-years
of incarceration time...

445
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:23,125
...based on my cases.
My record speaks for itself.

446
00:34:23,334 --> 00:34:25,252
How many felons have you got?

447
00:34:27,505 --> 00:34:28,797
I rest my case.

448
00:34:34,345 --> 00:34:39,517
- I'm not smoking crack, all right?
- I'm glad. Put it in the glove box.

449
00:34:40,017 --> 00:34:41,894
Put the $60 in there too.

450
00:34:42,102 --> 00:34:46,482
That'll come in handy.
We'll use it like a credit card.

451
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:58,452
No matter what I say,
you did the right thing.

452
00:35:00,871 --> 00:35:04,792
Reminds me when I was
chasing down bad guys.

453
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,628
Pretty amazing shit you did
back there.

454
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:10,923
Thanks.

455
00:35:11,507 --> 00:35:15,010
I noticed you applied that chokehold
though, huh?

456
00:35:16,095 --> 00:35:17,888
That's a no-no procedure.

457
00:35:19,765 --> 00:35:23,602
- I was getting my ass kicked.
- You did what you had to do.

458
00:35:23,811 --> 00:35:26,438
You did what you had to do.

459
00:35:27,857 --> 00:35:29,191
That's right.

460
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:35,072
What a wolf does. You a wolf?

461
00:35:36,198 --> 00:35:38,993
Come on, wolf! Come on, dog!

462
00:35:41,996 --> 00:35:45,124
No, I said a wolf,
not a rooster, a wolf.

463
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:52,548
- That's a rooster, give me a wolf!
- Give me a beer!

464
00:35:52,798 --> 00:35:55,009
There you go! That's my nigga.

465
00:35:56,594 --> 00:35:58,637
You got the magic eye, Hoyt.

466
00:35:58,846 --> 00:36:01,891
You have the magic eye.

467
00:36:02,308 --> 00:36:04,101
You up your street IQ...

468
00:36:04,351 --> 00:36:06,937
...you'll do some damage,
I guarantee.

469
00:36:09,064 --> 00:36:10,065
Crime fighter.

470
00:36:53,067 --> 00:36:54,735
- What you need?
- Crack.

471
00:36:55,903 --> 00:36:57,863
- Uh, 20 bucks....
- Crack?

472
00:37:00,366 --> 00:37:04,286
Smell like bacon!
Do I look like a sucker to you, nigga?

473
00:37:05,287 --> 00:37:06,956
Fuck you, rookie!

474
00:37:12,086 --> 00:37:13,128
Go fetch, dog.

475
00:37:13,546 --> 00:37:15,214
You want me to....

476
00:37:17,091 --> 00:37:20,094
Oh, come on, man, it's....

477
00:37:26,433 --> 00:37:28,769
Give me a break! Hey, you! Slow up!

478
00:37:34,191 --> 00:37:35,359
Come on, stop!

479
00:37:35,568 --> 00:37:39,280
Police officer! Police officer! Stop!
Come on, man!

480
00:37:39,488 --> 00:37:40,990
Give me a break! Shit!

481
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:45,286
Get out! Get out of here
or I call police.

482
00:37:46,453 --> 00:37:50,291
Police officer, ma'am, calm down.
I said stop! Stop!

483
00:37:50,499 --> 00:37:52,668
Get the fuck off me. Fuck off.

484
00:37:58,591 --> 00:38:01,969
You're making this so much harder!
Just calm down!

485
00:38:08,726 --> 00:38:10,686
You love this shit, huh?

486
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,397
Hey, man, hey!

Pick him up!

488
00:38:15,316 --> 00:38:18,569
Civil rights violating motherfuckers!

489
00:38:18,777 --> 00:38:19,820
Fuck!

490
00:38:20,613 --> 00:38:23,949
- Watch the fucking legs, man!
- Pick his legs up.

491
00:38:24,158 --> 00:38:28,204
Ain't got nothing better to do
than fuck with me, man? Shit!

492
00:38:31,582 --> 00:38:33,042
Who you working for?

493
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:36,045
I ain't work for nobody!
I'm on disability!

494
00:38:36,253 --> 00:38:38,172
Shit! You know you cracking.

495
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:40,174
I don't sell no more.

496
00:38:41,258 --> 00:38:42,718
- No rocks?
- No rocks.

497
00:38:43,511 --> 00:38:45,846
- But I found this.
- No, you don't.

498
00:38:46,055 --> 00:38:49,225
That motherfucker planted
that shit on me.

499
00:38:49,433 --> 00:38:52,645
Put me in the front seat,
I'll whup his ass!

500
00:38:55,105 --> 00:38:56,524
Who you working for?

501
00:38:56,732 --> 00:39:00,486
Told you I don't work for nobody, man!

502
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:02,112
Where the rocks?

503
00:39:02,571 --> 00:39:04,865
I got nothing on me.
I gave it up.

504
00:39:08,702 --> 00:39:09,703
Where the rocks?

505
00:39:11,705 --> 00:39:12,873
Open your mouth.

506
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:14,583
You a doctor now?

507
00:39:14,792 --> 00:39:16,377
A dentist. Open it.

508
00:39:17,545 --> 00:39:18,879
Lift up your tongue.

509
00:39:20,506 --> 00:39:24,051
Your partner already searched me.
I'm straight.

510
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,886
Yeah, okay.

511
00:39:26,095 --> 00:39:28,389
You got a pen, got a writing pen?

512
00:39:29,515 --> 00:39:32,059
Didn't see the motherfucker coming!

513
00:39:33,727 --> 00:39:35,062
Nothing in there?

514
00:39:37,898 --> 00:39:39,316
Nothing, man!

515
00:39:39,525 --> 00:39:41,193
Ain't got nothing, huh?

516
00:39:44,071 --> 00:39:45,573
God!

517
00:39:46,115 --> 00:39:48,450

00:39:54,039 --> 00:39:56,458
Oh, you federally fucked now.

521
00:39:56,917 --> 00:39:59,753
You got crack and a gun.

522
00:39:59,962 --> 00:40:03,716
With your record you'll get
10 years per bullet, you know?

523
00:40:03,924 --> 00:40:05,467
Give me a name, now.

524
00:40:06,177 --> 00:40:09,430
- You know I ain't no snitch!
- I know you ain't.

525
00:40:10,431 --> 00:40:11,473
Give me a name.

526
00:40:12,516 --> 00:40:14,226
- Twenty. A name!
- Fuck!

527
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:17,229
That's 30 years!

528
00:40:17,521 --> 00:40:19,899
You want to go to jail or go home?

529
00:40:20,941 --> 00:40:22,401
- He in County.
- Who?

530
00:40:23,194 --> 00:40:26,906
This nigga named Sandman.
That's all I know! Shit!

531
00:40:27,156 --> 00:40:28,199
Sandman?

532
00:40:29,158 --> 00:40:30,618
See how easy it was?

533
00:40:34,413 --> 00:40:36,999
- Unhook him.
- Sick of this shit, man!

534
00:40:37,208 --> 00:40:38,751
Want the evidence?

535
00:40:38,959 --> 00:40:41,086
- Fuck that, man.

536
00:40:56,227 --> 00:40:57,478
<i>- It's Bob.</i>

<i>- How's it going?</i>
- It's Alonzo.

538
00:40:59,563 --> 00:41:01,190

<i>- Why?</i>

539
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,402
I need a res on a Sandman.
He may be in custody.

540
00:41:05,611 --> 00:41:07,905
<i>- Hold on. I'll check.</i>
- No problem.

541
00:41:08,113 --> 00:41:11,116
That doesn't fly anymore.
Shoving a pen down.

542
00:41:11,325 --> 00:41:13,661
- What if he complains?
- To who?

543
00:41:13,911 --> 00:41:18,457
<i>23130, 113th Street.</i>
<i>Kevin Miller, a.k.a. Sandman. Got it?</i>

544
00:41:18,666 --> 00:41:20,292

545
00:41:20,501 --> 00:41:24,004
- Out there by lmperial Courts?
<i>- Exactly, uh-huh.</i>

546

<i>- No problem.</i>

547
00:41:28,759 --> 00:41:31,512
- We go after Sandman?
- We go after him.

548
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,562
Opening a Circuit City?

549
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:24,190
No, unclaimed shit from Property.

550
00:42:24,398 --> 00:42:27,526
Hand it out to my CI's, witnesses,
victims.

551
00:42:27,735 --> 00:42:30,905
Try to help out their families.
Put this on.

552
00:42:32,448 --> 00:42:33,908
Come on, let's go.

553
00:42:34,408 --> 00:42:39,747
Intel says she lives here alone.
She got two female juveniles...

554
00:42:39,955 --> 00:42:41,707
...possibly a male juvenile.

555
00:42:41,916 --> 00:42:45,336
- If he's not here, why are we?
- To serve this warrant.

556
00:42:45,586 --> 00:42:49,173
- We can't do that.
- Yes, we can. We the police.

557
00:42:49,381 --> 00:42:51,759
- Why not get a real warrant?
- We trying to get shit done.

558
00:42:51,967 --> 00:42:54,720
Stand over there
and don't get me killed.

559
00:42:57,932 --> 00:43:01,227
- Police, we got a search warrant!
- L.A.P.D., open up!

560
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,438
Kevin ain't here!

561
00:43:04,647 --> 00:43:06,899
Just open the door!

562
00:43:07,107 --> 00:43:08,651
Kevin ain't here!

563
00:43:08,859 --> 00:43:12,154
- Open the door, ma'am!
- He ain't even here!

564
00:43:12,947 --> 00:43:15,282
I said Kevin ain't even over here!

565
00:43:15,491 --> 00:43:17,743
We got a search warrant.
Open up.

566
00:43:18,452 --> 00:43:19,912
Ain't nobody here!

567
00:43:20,412 --> 00:43:23,082
Get your big ass down!
Right down! Down!

568
00:43:23,332 --> 00:43:26,126
Don't move, spread them out!
Don't move!

569
00:43:26,377 --> 00:43:29,463
Anybody in the house?
Is anybody in the house?!

570
00:43:29,672 --> 00:43:32,424
My nephew, Dimitri! In the bedroom!

571
00:43:32,675 --> 00:43:36,679
Okay. I'm gonna clear the house,
check it for weapons.

572
00:43:46,021 --> 00:43:47,523
Kitchen's clear!

573
00:43:58,117 --> 00:43:59,326
- Dimitri?
- Yeah?

574
00:43:59,994 --> 00:44:02,037
Put your hands up, son.

575
00:44:02,663 --> 00:44:04,165
- Anybody else?
- No.

576
00:44:04,373 --> 00:44:06,041
- You sure?
- Yeah.

577
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:10,671
Okay, just stay right there.
Don't move! Don't you move.

578
00:44:11,255 --> 00:44:14,300
Stand up. Keep your hands
where I can see them.

579
00:44:14,508 --> 00:44:17,970
Sit down and place them
on your knees.

580
00:44:18,179 --> 00:44:20,347
Sit down. We're the good guys.

581
00:44:20,848 --> 00:44:24,268
Just sit down right over there
next to your auntie.

582
00:44:24,476 --> 00:44:25,769
Right over there.

583
00:44:26,228 --> 00:44:28,898
House is Code-4.
I'm starting the search.

584
00:44:41,452 --> 00:44:43,871
- I wanna see that warrant.
- The what?

585
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:45,831
The warrant. I need a copy.

586
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,918
My partner has it.
He'll be out soon.

587
00:44:50,878 --> 00:44:52,254
Where's your backup?

588
00:44:53,464 --> 00:44:57,218
Just be quiet until we're through
with our investigation.

589
00:44:57,426 --> 00:45:00,387
- You got the gun, don't you?
- That's right.

590
00:45:00,596 --> 00:45:03,474
Punk-ass, bitch-ass, crooked-ass cop!

591
00:45:04,975 --> 00:45:06,101
You a rookie.

592
00:45:07,269 --> 00:45:09,104
Give me a break, okay?

593
00:45:14,818 --> 00:45:16,403
How you doing over there?

594
00:45:16,612 --> 00:45:20,533
You cool? Come on.
Don't worry about it, you're cool.

595
00:45:20,866 --> 00:45:22,576
Just stay cool.

596
00:45:23,619 --> 00:45:24,703
All right.

597
00:45:29,416 --> 00:45:33,128
- Ma'am, please sit down.
- You act like you pay the rent!

598
00:45:33,337 --> 00:45:35,089
- Sit down!
- You all stink!

599
00:45:35,297 --> 00:45:37,842
You gotta get drunk to come
up here!

600
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:40,010
- Sit down now!
- Y'all stink!

601
00:45:40,344 --> 00:45:42,471
You're gonna shoot me, boss?

602
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:48,352
Close your eyes.
This punk cop is gonna shoot me!

603
00:45:48,561 --> 00:45:50,604
- Sit down, right now!
- Okay.

604
00:45:50,813 --> 00:45:52,523
Okay! Everything is fine.

605
00:45:52,857 --> 00:45:54,525
We made a mistake.

606
00:45:55,901 --> 00:45:59,822
Didn't find a damn thing.
I'm very sorry.

607
00:46:00,197 --> 00:46:02,533
Thanks for your cooperation.
Let's go.

608
00:46:02,867 --> 00:46:04,910
- Show me that warrant.
- What?

609
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:07,997
I want to see that goddamn warrant!

610
00:46:11,208 --> 00:46:13,294
Here you go. Let's go!

611
00:46:17,798 --> 00:46:19,008
Shit!

612
00:46:22,469 --> 00:46:23,679
Motherfuckers!

613
00:46:24,138 --> 00:46:27,474
Hey, jackers! Give me my money back.

614
00:46:27,683 --> 00:46:30,769
You ain't no police!
Give me my money back!

615
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:35,274
Jackers, why you all standing
over there?! Blast them fools!

616
00:46:35,482 --> 00:46:38,235
You ain't no police!

617
00:46:38,444 --> 00:46:40,404
I want my money back!

618
00:46:40,613 --> 00:46:42,323
Start, you motherfucker!

619
00:46:42,781 --> 00:46:44,074
Fuck! Gun!

620
00:46:44,283 --> 00:46:46,911
- Just get out of here!
- Stay in the car!

621
00:46:51,624 --> 00:46:53,334
Yeah, motherfuckers!

622
00:47:15,606 --> 00:47:19,151
That was not cool, all right?
That was not cool at all!

623
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,570
Opening fire in a neighborhood.

624
00:47:21,779 --> 00:47:25,991
Where was the Sandman?
What were you doing back there?

625
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:31,497
Checking for narcotics activity.
Drugs, guns, baggies, you know?

626
00:47:31,705 --> 00:47:34,124
- Yeah, cash!
- Speak on it, son.

627
00:47:34,333 --> 00:47:36,961
- She's screaming about money--
- Bullshit.

628
00:47:37,169 --> 00:47:39,755
She's screaming
about having us killed!

629
00:47:39,964 --> 00:47:45,010
I'll be on the 6:00 news
in handcuffs because of you.

630
00:47:45,219 --> 00:47:48,639
With the scandals,
it is open season on misconduct.

631
00:47:48,848 --> 00:47:51,559
- They'll nail us to the wall.
- Pull over.

632
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,144
- Pull over.
- Here?

633
00:47:54,395 --> 00:47:56,188
- Yeah, pull over.
- Shit!

634
00:48:15,791 --> 00:48:16,792
What?

635
00:48:19,128 --> 00:48:20,129
Listen.

636
00:48:21,088 --> 00:48:23,716
You're in a privileged position
to learn.

637
00:48:23,924 --> 00:48:25,968
Keep your mouth shut, eyes open.

638
00:48:26,177 --> 00:48:29,388
Want to do some good,
this is the place to learn.

639
00:48:29,763 --> 00:48:33,726
You can't take it, maybe you
should go back to your division.

640
00:48:33,976 --> 00:48:38,439
Get a nice job lighting flares
or measuring car wrecks.

641
00:48:39,064 --> 00:48:42,651
You got to decide
whether you're a wolf...

642
00:48:43,777 --> 00:48:45,237
...or a sheep.

643
00:48:49,658 --> 00:48:52,286
Get your ink...

644
00:48:55,956 --> 00:48:57,708
...or go give him a hand.

645
00:49:28,322 --> 00:49:30,950
What are we doing here?
We'll get killed.

646
00:49:31,158 --> 00:49:34,787
- You know about this place?
- It's the Jungle, right?

647
00:49:34,995 --> 00:49:38,123
They say don't come with anything
less than a platoon.

648
00:49:48,092 --> 00:49:50,052
This is the heart of it.

649
00:49:50,511 --> 00:49:52,555
Jungle. Damu headquarters.

650
00:49:53,806 --> 00:49:55,224
Stoners.

651
00:49:55,432 --> 00:49:58,310
A lot of murder investigations
lead here.

652
00:49:58,686 --> 00:50:00,813
One way in, one way out.

653
00:50:01,438 --> 00:50:03,607
Thought we were going to eat.

654
00:50:03,983 --> 00:50:08,112
Don't ever come here without me.
I'm serious. For your safety.

655
00:50:13,868 --> 00:50:16,871
- How'd you get a golden pass?
- I treat them fair.

656
00:50:17,246 --> 00:50:20,708
They know if they cross the line,
I tax that ass.

657
00:50:34,388 --> 00:50:36,015
What's that, up there?

658
00:50:36,891 --> 00:50:40,227
They flipping pigeons
to signal I'm here.

659
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:10,090
- What's up, Bone?
- What's up?

660
00:51:10,341 --> 00:51:12,176
- What's up?
- It's all good.

661
00:51:12,426 --> 00:51:15,804
I appreciate what you did
for my nephew.

662
00:51:16,013 --> 00:51:17,723
For sure. For sure.

663
00:51:20,017 --> 00:51:21,477
You better call me.

664
00:51:26,023 --> 00:51:28,317
I'm sick of it.
I can't stand him!

665
00:51:28,692 --> 00:51:32,154
- Who are they?
- Nobody. I got them under my thumb.

666
00:51:32,404 --> 00:51:36,450
- What's up, Alonzo?
- All right, Spider. What's happening?

667
00:51:36,659 --> 00:51:40,079
Hey, what's up, girl? Look at you.
Go ahead.

668
00:51:40,287 --> 00:51:42,581
All that jelly and no toast.

669
00:51:42,957 --> 00:51:46,418
- Who lives here?
- Just one of my lovelies.

670
00:51:46,627 --> 00:51:49,296
A loving touch, you know?
Don't worry.

671
00:52:14,613 --> 00:52:16,657
New guy, Jake.

672
00:52:18,993 --> 00:52:22,037
Nice to meet you.
Welcome to my house.

673
00:52:22,288 --> 00:52:25,791
- Give him some food. Take care of him.
- Of course.

674
00:52:28,627 --> 00:52:32,339
- Of course. How are you?
- Good, good.

675
00:52:34,049 --> 00:52:38,220
I have cable.
You watch whatever you want, okay?

676
00:52:38,679 --> 00:52:41,140
- Thanks.
- This is your house.

677
00:52:42,808 --> 00:52:44,268
I'll be right back.

678
00:52:54,028 --> 00:52:56,238
- How you doing?
- Fine.

679
00:53:02,661 --> 00:53:07,124
Now, this is all El Salvadorian food.

680
00:53:07,333 --> 00:53:09,210
Thank you. It looks great.

681
00:53:12,713 --> 00:53:13,672
I have to go.

682
00:53:14,215 --> 00:53:16,592
Yeah, all right.

683
00:54:01,679 --> 00:54:04,473
Let's go.
We got a meeting in 15 minutes.

684
00:54:05,099 --> 00:54:07,643
- I just need to--
- Forget it. Let's go.

685
00:54:08,894 --> 00:54:10,271
I'll see you, buddy.

686
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:40,551
You okay?

687
00:55:18,881 --> 00:55:20,174
Here, use this.

688
00:55:21,425 --> 00:55:23,219
- Who's here?
- L.A.P.D.'s finest.

689
00:55:23,427 --> 00:55:25,804
Don't speak till you're spoken to.

690
00:55:26,055 --> 00:55:27,097
Come on.

691
00:55:44,573 --> 00:55:45,574
Good to see you.

692
00:55:45,783 --> 00:55:49,912
That's my new guy. Jake Hoyt.
Captain Lou Jacobs.

693
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:52,748
Need to talk to the feds,
go to him first.

694
00:55:52,998 --> 00:55:54,834
He'll take your back for you.

695
00:55:55,084 --> 00:55:57,837
Stan Gursky,
he runs the D.A. shooting team.

696
00:55:58,045 --> 00:56:00,673
Think about him
before you shoot someone.

697
00:56:00,881 --> 00:56:04,218
If you're wrong,
he'll use your nuts for dice.

698
00:56:04,426 --> 00:56:07,555
Right here,
Detective Doug Rosselli...

699
00:56:07,763 --> 00:56:11,559
...handles theft cases
for the French-poodle crowd.

700
00:56:11,809 --> 00:56:13,811
He's a good man.

701
00:56:14,019 --> 00:56:16,397
- Pleased to meet you.
- Good man.

702
00:56:17,398 --> 00:56:19,024
- Should I...?
- Shoo.

703
00:56:19,233 --> 00:56:21,527
Get yourself a steak or something.

704
00:56:22,653 --> 00:56:24,446
All right, gents.

705
00:56:25,573 --> 00:56:29,451
I don't know why I'm meeting you.
I don't talk to dead men.

706
00:56:30,077 --> 00:56:31,704
I ain't dead yet.

707
00:56:31,954 --> 00:56:34,665
Fucking prick. Excuse me.

708
00:56:37,001 --> 00:56:38,544
Why the long face, Doug?

709
00:56:39,128 --> 00:56:42,756
- Feds seize your house or something?
- Fuck yourself.

710
00:56:43,465 --> 00:56:45,134
Tell him the story.

711
00:56:45,843 --> 00:56:47,386
Come on, tell the story.

712
00:56:47,595 --> 00:56:51,348
- If it's so funny, you tell him.
- It's your story.

713
00:56:52,808 --> 00:56:54,143
Asshole.

714
00:56:57,271 --> 00:56:59,815
All right.
There's a serial burglar.

715
00:57:02,026 --> 00:57:04,403
Chased him for a year.
A real slickster.

716
00:57:04,612 --> 00:57:07,198
Captain's riding my ass
the whole time.

717
00:57:07,656 --> 00:57:10,367
- Sentencing was today.
- Judge is female.

718
00:57:10,659 --> 00:57:12,286
That's right. Landers.

719
00:57:12,495 --> 00:57:14,914
I know Landers. She's a sharp lady.

720
00:57:18,292 --> 00:57:19,335
No?

721
00:57:19,585 --> 00:57:24,340
Guy gets ahold of some peanut butter,
packs his ass-crack with it.

722
00:57:25,257 --> 00:57:29,470
He's standing before the bench,
waiting to give his statement.

723
00:57:29,678 --> 00:57:34,183
Shoves his hand down his pants,
comes out with extra-chunky Jif.

724
00:57:37,478 --> 00:57:39,438
Bailiffs won't come near him.

725
00:57:43,692 --> 00:57:47,029
Now he looks the judge
right in the eyes...

726
00:57:47,238 --> 00:57:49,490
...and licks his fingers clean.

727
00:57:51,659 --> 00:57:53,035
Holy shit.

728
00:57:53,786 --> 00:57:55,704
So the judge says:

729
00:57:55,955 --> 00:57:58,707
"This man's insane.
He can't go to prison."

730
00:57:58,916 --> 00:58:01,919
- Sends him to Psychiatric.
- She fell for it.

731
00:58:02,127 --> 00:58:04,004
Yeah! She's so fucking smart.

732
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:08,843
By the time she found out,
the guy's already been transferred.

733
00:58:14,431 --> 00:58:17,142
- Proceedings closed.
- Yeah, closed.

734
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:20,771
He'll do six months
in the puzzle factory...

735
00:58:21,021 --> 00:58:22,481
...and they'll let him go.

736
00:58:22,690 --> 00:58:24,859
Never, ever do a day in prison.

737
00:58:25,276 --> 00:58:29,196
Give him credit. He worked the system,
deserves his freedom.

738
00:58:29,446 --> 00:58:31,448
Yeah? Think so?

739
00:58:31,949 --> 00:58:33,159
Or not.

740
00:58:34,743 --> 00:58:36,203
I'll tell you what.

741
00:58:36,871 --> 00:58:39,248
I'll find this guy on the street...

742
00:58:39,790 --> 00:58:41,250
...and I'll do him.

743
00:58:45,921 --> 00:58:48,424
Better take his bullets away,
Stan.

744
00:58:49,383 --> 00:58:50,843
Shit!

745
00:58:54,555 --> 00:58:57,641
Heard you had an expensive weekend
in Vegas.

746
00:58:58,517 --> 00:59:02,104
How did you ever screw up so bad?

747
00:59:02,313 --> 00:59:05,357
It's nothing.
I didn't know. It's not my town.

748
00:59:05,566 --> 00:59:08,110
The Russians don't care
if you're a cop.

749
00:59:08,736 --> 00:59:11,780
They'll whack you.
You ought to get on a plane.

750
00:59:11,989 --> 00:59:13,199
Why?

751
00:59:13,741 --> 00:59:15,743
- It's an easy fix.
- How?

752
00:59:15,951 --> 00:59:17,912
I'll just cash in an account.

753
00:59:19,121 --> 00:59:21,957
- Whose?
- One of my old ones. My first one.

754
00:59:23,459 --> 00:59:25,878
The guy's a high-security risk.

755
00:59:26,086 --> 00:59:29,381
If I'm not around,
who will keep him off the radar?

756
00:59:29,590 --> 00:59:33,260
I'm just taxing him, that's all.
Okay?

757
00:59:41,685 --> 00:59:43,229
It's your call.

758
00:59:44,396 --> 00:59:46,273
Don't dick this up.

759
00:59:46,565 --> 00:59:50,778
I do not want to see you
on the front page like the others.

760
00:59:51,862 --> 00:59:53,322
Yeah, I understand.

761
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:55,699
Who's driving?

762
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:58,494
Me. Gray Mercedes.

763
01:00:01,539 --> 01:00:02,665
Get the car.

764
01:00:05,209 --> 01:00:09,255
Black Monte Carlo there,
back windows shot out.

765
01:00:23,435 --> 01:00:26,188
It's me.
Listen, we got the green light.

766
01:00:26,689 --> 01:00:29,859
Fax a copy
of the warrant to the clerk.

767
01:00:30,067 --> 01:00:34,697
Get it signed by the judge, and I want
you and Paul to bring it to me.

768
01:00:34,947 --> 01:00:38,367
Tell Jeff to pick up some tools.
Picks and shovels.

769
01:00:38,617 --> 01:00:42,913
Make sure he signs them out
from maintenance. Copy?

770
01:00:43,497 --> 01:00:45,875
That's right. Hurry up! Later.

771
01:00:47,751 --> 01:00:50,254
So how much cash was in that jacket?

772
01:00:50,921 --> 01:00:52,715
Forty G's.

773
01:00:53,090 --> 01:00:54,884
What's that for?

774
01:00:55,467 --> 01:00:58,053
- Really want to know?
- Yes, I do.

775
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:03,392
Nothing's free in this world.
Not even arrest warrants.

776
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:06,687
Shit, man, I didn't want to know.

777
01:01:18,032 --> 01:01:20,868
Check this out.
Nice suit, Mark.

778
01:01:21,076 --> 01:01:23,996
- Beautiful suit.
- Yeah, fuck you guys!

779
01:01:41,931 --> 01:01:43,724
All right. Nice, nice.

780
01:01:44,225 --> 01:01:45,768
What's up, Alonzo?

781
01:01:46,310 --> 01:01:48,771
- The picks and shovels?
- ln the trunk.

782
01:01:49,146 --> 01:01:50,272
Digging a ditch?

783
01:01:52,191 --> 01:01:55,110
No, you are.
Nice suit you got on there.

784
01:01:55,319 --> 01:01:57,112
That's what I said.

785
01:01:58,072 --> 01:02:00,616
- What up, killer?
- What's up with you?

786
01:02:00,866 --> 01:02:04,286
- Heard you ran into trouble.
- It's all good.

787
01:02:04,495 --> 01:02:06,789
Don't worry, everything's fine.

788
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:10,668
Shit, if we can get away with it,
I'm with you.

789
01:02:11,627 --> 01:02:16,173
- Who the fuck is this?
- Jake Hoyt. It's my first day.

790
01:02:16,423 --> 01:02:18,926
You're a long way from Starbucks.

791
01:02:21,345 --> 01:02:25,182
- Why the fuck is he here?
- Gotta get his cherry popped.

792
01:02:25,432 --> 01:02:27,309
Stay the fuck out of my way.

793
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:30,396
This is for the big dogs. Feel me?

794
01:02:31,021 --> 01:02:34,692
Here it is, all legit,
signed by the judge, okay?

795
01:02:34,942 --> 01:02:37,236
Thanks to the Sandman.
Now listen.

796
01:02:37,486 --> 01:02:39,113
Safety is first.

797
01:02:39,321 --> 01:02:41,866
He gives us shit,
we give him lead.

798
01:02:42,116 --> 01:02:45,452
Let's do this right
so we can all go home.

799
01:02:46,370 --> 01:02:48,497
Time to punch in, ladies.

800
01:03:36,545 --> 01:03:38,589
Freeze! On the floor!

801
01:03:38,839 --> 01:03:41,300
- Down!
- What are you clowns doing?

802
01:03:41,550 --> 01:03:43,886
Hey, new guy, watch him!

803
01:03:44,929 --> 01:03:47,932
- I'm on him.
- You know what you're doing?

804
01:03:48,182 --> 01:03:49,391
Drop your gun!

805
01:03:49,683 --> 01:03:52,353
Five. Four. Three.

806
01:03:54,188 --> 01:03:55,814
Boom!

807
01:03:57,983 --> 01:04:00,110
Give me a reason.

808
01:04:00,611 --> 01:04:03,155
Alonzo's gonna have your ass.

809
01:04:03,572 --> 01:04:05,282
What's up, Roger?

810
01:04:05,950 --> 01:04:09,912
- What's going down, brother?
- Oh, it's all good, baby.

811
01:04:12,331 --> 01:04:14,124
It's all good.

812
01:04:16,961 --> 01:04:19,088
That's for you.

813
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:24,510
What am I supposed to do with this?
Wipe my ass?

814
01:04:27,304 --> 01:04:29,348
Bad news, dog.

815
01:04:29,557 --> 01:04:32,643
Gimme some of that $300-a-glass shit.

816
01:04:32,893 --> 01:04:35,020
Please.

817
01:04:35,896 --> 01:04:38,566
Had lunch with the wise men.

818
01:04:38,774 --> 01:04:40,818
You gotta render unto Caesar.

819
01:04:41,068 --> 01:04:44,446
- Those vampires want my pension.
- No, no.

820
01:04:49,910 --> 01:04:51,203
Just a tax.

821
01:04:51,453 --> 01:04:55,666
They got their boats and mistresses,
house payments.

822
01:04:55,875 --> 01:04:59,670
Nothing I can do.
I'm just a lowly civil servant.

823
01:05:00,004 --> 01:05:02,131
You're their bitch.

824
01:05:02,339 --> 01:05:05,092
- What about me?
- I got your back.

825
01:05:05,342 --> 01:05:09,305
Don't worry, we won't
take anything you'll miss.

826
01:05:11,182 --> 01:05:13,392
I'm sorry. Orders, dog.

827
01:05:13,642 --> 01:05:15,019
No you ain't, cop.

828
01:05:17,188 --> 01:05:19,064
In the kitchen, fellas.

829
01:05:19,857 --> 01:05:21,734
Give me the bitch.

830
01:05:23,068 --> 01:05:25,446
You guys hold him down.

831
01:05:26,363 --> 01:05:28,657
- Who'll pay for my floor?
- The city.

832
01:05:37,750 --> 01:05:39,293
Right here.

833
01:06:17,706 --> 01:06:20,167
That's what I'm talking about.

834
01:06:28,425 --> 01:06:30,052
What's in here? Coke?

835
01:06:30,302 --> 01:06:31,762
You'll see.

836
01:06:32,012 --> 01:06:35,808
Grab that hammer
and knock this lock off.

837
01:06:38,269 --> 01:06:40,563
One, two....

838
01:06:48,863 --> 01:06:51,198
That's $250,000 you're holding.

839
01:06:51,448 --> 01:06:53,868
Over four million in here.

840
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:56,120
A $3 million bust on day one.

841
01:06:56,328 --> 01:06:59,582
- You said four.
- Minus tax, brother!

842
01:06:59,790 --> 01:07:02,251
Nothing's free in this world.

843
01:07:02,585 --> 01:07:06,964
Buy your wife a car.
Put the kids through college.

844
01:07:07,173 --> 01:07:10,259
The only checks I cash say "L.A.P.D."

845
01:07:11,969 --> 01:07:14,722
Somebody didn't sleep
through Ethics.

846
01:07:16,015 --> 01:07:18,434
You don't want a piece of this?

847
01:07:21,020 --> 01:07:22,813
No, right?

848
01:07:23,772 --> 01:07:25,232
Not like this.

849
01:07:25,482 --> 01:07:27,443
No.

850
01:07:28,235 --> 01:07:30,362
No?

851
01:07:33,991 --> 01:07:38,621
First time, you're not comfortable.
I'll hold it for you.

852
01:07:38,913 --> 01:07:41,749
- What about you?
- Oh, I'm comfortable.

853
01:07:42,708 --> 01:07:45,461
- How about you?
- I'm very comfortable.

854
01:07:45,794 --> 01:07:47,796
Let's wrap this up.

855
01:07:50,925 --> 01:07:53,928
Don't touch a thing! Evidence.

856
01:07:58,557 --> 01:08:01,560
Alonzo, what are
those pricks thinking?

857
01:08:01,852 --> 01:08:06,315
That I'm gonna stand still and
let them horsefuck me?

858
01:08:06,565 --> 01:08:09,735
Could put you out of your misery.

859
01:08:11,278 --> 01:08:12,530
Hey, Jake, here.

860
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:16,408
Sit down.

861
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:22,623
Here's a secret:

862
01:08:22,873 --> 01:08:25,000
When you kill someone on duty...

863
01:08:25,209 --> 01:08:29,046
...they have to be your slave
in the afterlife.

864
01:08:32,925 --> 01:08:35,010
There you go.

865
01:08:35,386 --> 01:08:37,012
Start an entourage.

866
01:08:40,724 --> 01:08:42,017
- Shoot him?
- Yeah.

867
01:08:42,268 --> 01:08:44,937
Come on, kid. Do me a favor.

868
01:08:45,145 --> 01:08:46,939
Come on.

869
01:08:47,273 --> 01:08:49,316
Do yourself a favor. Hit him.

870
01:08:49,567 --> 01:08:50,860
Are you serious?

871
01:08:51,443 --> 01:08:53,946
Hey, close the blinds.

872
01:09:04,248 --> 01:09:06,750
- All right, I'll shoot him.
- Go.

873
01:09:11,255 --> 01:09:12,381
- Pow!
- Boom!

874
01:09:15,551 --> 01:09:17,094
Shoot him.

875
01:09:17,511 --> 01:09:18,971
No, man.

876
01:09:20,848 --> 01:09:23,601
Kids these days.
Not gonna do it?

877
01:09:23,851 --> 01:09:26,437
All right, give it to me.

878
01:09:26,812 --> 01:09:27,855
Rookies!

879
01:09:28,105 --> 01:09:31,108
You want shit done,
you gotta do it yourself.

880
01:09:32,651 --> 01:09:33,611
Holy shit!

881
01:09:35,404 --> 01:09:37,364
Come on, breathe.

882
01:09:37,615 --> 01:09:39,742
Breathe, there you go.

883
01:09:42,912 --> 01:09:44,121
Just let it go.

884
01:09:45,331 --> 01:09:46,957
Breathe, dog!

885
01:09:55,966 --> 01:09:56,926
He's finished.

886
01:09:58,219 --> 01:10:00,721
- Where's the stinger?
- Right here.

887
01:10:04,350 --> 01:10:05,559
All right, Jeff.

888
01:10:05,809 --> 01:10:07,603
You took fire coming in.

889
01:10:07,811 --> 01:10:10,272
I need some time off, but....

890
01:10:12,024 --> 01:10:14,860
- Watch the shades.
- All right.

891
01:10:18,447 --> 01:10:19,907
- Ready?
- Kiss me.

892
01:10:20,157 --> 01:10:21,700
One....

893
01:10:24,411 --> 01:10:25,579
- You okay?
- Yeah.

894
01:10:25,871 --> 01:10:28,249
I gotta give you one more, though.

895
01:10:28,499 --> 01:10:29,500
Do it.

896
01:10:30,334 --> 01:10:32,127
Fuck!

897
01:10:32,586 --> 01:10:35,589
It's not what you know,
it's what you prove.

898
01:10:35,798 --> 01:10:39,218
Here it is.
Mark and Paul kick the door.

899
01:10:39,468 --> 01:10:42,388
Jeff's in first.
Roger fires twice.

900
01:10:46,767 --> 01:10:48,727
What, one go through?

901
01:10:48,936 --> 01:10:52,106
- You shot him!
- You fucking shot me, man!

902
01:10:52,356 --> 01:10:54,567
- Don't worry.
- Call an ambulance!

903
01:10:55,401 --> 01:10:57,570
Go to jail, or go home?

904
01:10:57,820 --> 01:10:59,989
All right, here's the scenario.

905
01:11:00,281 --> 01:11:03,617
Mark and Paul kick the door.
Jeff runs in.

906
01:11:03,868 --> 01:11:06,078
Roger opens fire, hits Jeff.

907
01:11:06,328 --> 01:11:10,958
Hoyt is in second,
drops Roger with the shotgun.

908
01:11:11,208 --> 01:11:13,335
- Who shot Roger?
- New guy.

909
01:11:13,711 --> 01:11:15,004
- New guy.
- You two?

910
01:11:15,254 --> 01:11:18,591
- Hoyt.
- Fuck Hoyt. Ambulance time!

911
01:11:18,841 --> 01:11:21,218
Done. Paul, call them up.

912
01:11:21,468 --> 01:11:24,221
11 -49.998. Shots fired.

913
01:11:24,471 --> 01:11:27,057
Officer down. Repeat, officer down.

914
01:11:27,349 --> 01:11:29,685
5951 Baxter Street.

915
01:11:30,186 --> 01:11:34,815
Congratulations. You're gonna get
a medal of valor for this.

916
01:11:35,024 --> 01:11:37,526
- I didn't shoot him.
- Four cops saw it.

917
01:11:37,776 --> 01:11:40,070
But I didn't. You did.

918
01:11:42,948 --> 01:11:48,537
"An L.A.P.D. narcotics officer
was killed today...

919
01:11:48,746 --> 01:11:51,332
...serving a warrant
in Echo Park."

920
01:11:51,582 --> 01:11:53,042
Give me the bitch.

921
01:11:56,462 --> 01:12:00,758
"A spokesperson said
the officer is survived...

922
01:12:02,218 --> 01:12:03,761
...by a wife and child."

923
01:12:04,178 --> 01:12:06,597
There's more. You get the picture?

924
01:12:06,889 --> 01:12:08,432
Yeah, I get it.

925
01:12:09,517 --> 01:12:13,062
That's the second time
you pointed a gun at me!

926
01:12:13,312 --> 01:12:15,731
Goddamn, boy! That's it, Jake!

927
01:12:16,065 --> 01:12:18,567
Y'all see this?
That's it!

928
01:12:18,817 --> 01:12:22,196
- I'll put a bullet in that melon.
- Wait, wait.

929
01:12:22,530 --> 01:12:25,032
I'm gonna be cool. Drop the gun!

930
01:12:25,282 --> 01:12:27,409
Shoot me.
He's coming with me.

931
01:12:27,618 --> 01:12:29,411
- I'll shoot!
- He's a fed.

932
01:12:29,662 --> 01:12:34,124
No, he ain't. He's just a kid
that got the drop on y'all.

933
01:12:34,375 --> 01:12:38,921
Let's take a deep breath
and just diffuse this. Jake?

934
01:12:39,213 --> 01:12:41,882
I didn't sign up for this!

935
01:12:42,132 --> 01:12:45,803
I know you're angry.
Everybody, put the guns down.

936
01:12:46,053 --> 01:12:48,597
- Hell, no.
- Choirboy first.

937
01:12:48,848 --> 01:12:51,141
Listen! That's an order!

938
01:12:51,392 --> 01:12:53,269
Put them down!

939
01:13:01,026 --> 01:13:03,445
Use your ears, Jake.

940
01:13:03,696 --> 01:13:06,615
Sometimes we take this shit
all the way.

941
01:13:06,866 --> 01:13:09,326
It's the nature of the business.

942
01:13:09,577 --> 01:13:14,456
You'll never have to pull
the trigger again, all right?

943
01:13:14,915 --> 01:13:17,918
- Mark, where are you transferring?
- S.I.S.

944
01:13:18,502 --> 01:13:19,628
Detective.

945
01:13:19,879 --> 01:13:23,924
You give me 18 months,
I give you a career.

946
01:13:24,175 --> 01:13:27,011
We make the big seizures, Jake.

947
01:13:27,261 --> 01:13:31,390
But if you're in my unit,
you gotta be in it all the way.

948
01:13:31,599 --> 01:13:34,685
I thought you were man enough
to handle this shit.

949
01:13:34,935 --> 01:13:38,772
Five decorated officers say
that you shot Roger.

950
01:13:39,023 --> 01:13:42,818
They will check your blood
for intoxicants.

951
01:13:43,068 --> 01:13:45,029
What are they gonna find?

952
01:13:45,821 --> 01:13:48,991
You've been smoking PCP all day.

953
01:13:49,241 --> 01:13:53,037
- You've been planning this all day.
- All week, son.

954
01:13:53,329 --> 01:13:56,832
You talk, your blood gets to the lab.

955
01:13:57,082 --> 01:14:00,961
You wanna take a walk?
You won't make it out of here.

956
01:14:01,212 --> 01:14:03,881
If you're cool, you're a hero.

957
01:14:04,131 --> 01:14:06,091
You're above suspicion.

958
01:14:06,342 --> 01:14:08,636
Alonzo, there's two shots left.

959
01:14:08,969 --> 01:14:12,681
We need to kill him now
and say Roger got him.

960
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:17,102
No, we ain't killing nobody.

961
01:14:17,394 --> 01:14:20,648
This is a good man. I can feel it.

962
01:14:20,856 --> 01:14:24,777
Just had a little freak-out,
that's all.

963
01:14:25,027 --> 01:14:26,904
I say he's cool.

964
01:14:27,154 --> 01:14:29,907
Nobody's gonna hurt him.

965
01:14:30,157 --> 01:14:32,368
You do have a decision to make.

966
01:14:32,576 --> 01:14:36,872
Because this place is gonna
be overrun with blue suits.

967
01:14:37,122 --> 01:14:41,919
So why don't you please
go outside, clear your head.

968
01:14:43,546 --> 01:14:45,756
Or shoot me.

969
01:14:58,769 --> 01:14:59,728
Hey, Paul?

970
01:15:05,109 --> 01:15:08,362
You're dead, motherfucker!
You hear me?! Dead!

971
01:16:25,189 --> 01:16:28,192
Well, lay off the device.

972
01:16:28,526 --> 01:16:29,902
All right.

973
01:16:31,654 --> 01:16:34,031
Make sure that tub is clean.

974
01:16:34,907 --> 01:16:36,367
All right?

975
01:16:39,245 --> 01:16:41,622
All right, later.

976
01:16:45,876 --> 01:16:47,586
You all right?

977
01:16:53,551 --> 01:16:57,012
It behooves you not
to dick around on this one.

978
01:16:57,930 --> 01:17:00,599
Justifiable homicide
in the line of duty.

979
01:17:00,850 --> 01:17:03,853
- Now, what happened--
- What happened was murder.

980
01:17:04,144 --> 01:17:06,689
And armed robbery.

981
01:17:06,981 --> 01:17:09,191
We had badges, so it's different?

982
01:17:09,441 --> 01:17:12,278
Son, open your eyes! Can't you see?

983
01:17:12,486 --> 01:17:17,199
That man was your friend,
and you killed him like a fly.

984
01:17:17,408 --> 01:17:19,201
My friend? Tell me why?

985
01:17:19,410 --> 01:17:22,496
Because he knows my first name?

986
01:17:22,705 --> 01:17:25,541
This is the game.
I played his ass.

987
01:17:25,749 --> 01:17:27,877
That's our job.

988
01:17:28,169 --> 01:17:33,048
Roger sold dope to kids.
The world's better off without him.

989
01:17:34,091 --> 01:17:39,054
This man was the biggest
major violator in Los Angeles.

990
01:17:39,305 --> 01:17:43,767
I watched that cocksucker for years
and now I got him.

991
01:17:43,976 --> 01:17:45,936
This is chess, not checkers!

992
01:17:53,986 --> 01:17:57,781
What'd you think?
We'd roll up in a black and white?

993
01:17:58,032 --> 01:18:00,034
Slap the cuffs on him?

994
01:18:00,284 --> 01:18:02,244
He's a high roller, dog.

995
01:18:06,207 --> 01:18:08,250
- Take the money.
- I'm not taking it.

996
01:18:08,501 --> 01:18:09,960
- Just take it.
- No!

997
01:18:10,169 --> 01:18:14,298
Look, I don't give a fuck, but
the boys'll feel better.

998
01:18:14,507 --> 01:18:16,717
Fuck their feelings!

999
01:18:16,967 --> 01:18:18,594
Jake, we're a team.

1000
01:18:18,802 --> 01:18:20,763
A team?

1001
01:18:20,971 --> 01:18:23,557
You guys are fucking insane.

1002
01:18:23,807 --> 01:18:27,478
I'll go back to the Valley,
I'll cut parking tickets.

1003
01:18:31,899 --> 01:18:34,401
- It can't be like this.
- It is.

1004
01:18:34,652 --> 01:18:36,362
I'm sorry, but it is.

1005
01:18:36,612 --> 01:18:38,948
It's ugly, but it's necessary.

1006
01:18:39,198 --> 01:18:44,286
I became a cop to put away
dealers and criminals, not to be one.

1007
01:18:44,537 --> 01:18:46,080
You sound just like me.

1008
01:18:46,455 --> 01:18:49,375
I know what you're
going through and feeling.

1009
01:18:49,583 --> 01:18:51,043
- You're scared.
- I'm not.

1010
01:18:51,293 --> 01:18:55,840
Yes, you are. Everyone goes
through that the first time. I did.

1011
01:18:56,882 --> 01:19:01,262
The sooner you match
what's in your head...

1012
01:19:01,512 --> 01:19:04,348
...with what's in the real world...

1013
01:19:04,557 --> 01:19:06,350
...the better you'll feel.

1014
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:08,310
In this business...

1015
01:19:08,519 --> 01:19:12,106
...you gotta have dirt on you
to be trusted.

1016
01:19:13,065 --> 01:19:17,695
When all this is behind you, a whole
other world will open up for you.

1017
01:19:20,030 --> 01:19:22,366
I walk a higher path, son.

1018
01:19:22,616 --> 01:19:25,452
I have the keys to all the doors.

1019
01:19:27,121 --> 01:19:28,497
What do you mean?

1020
01:19:29,665 --> 01:19:33,002
My guys aren't leaders, they're clowns.
You're a leader.

1021
01:19:33,252 --> 01:19:34,962
You want my job?
You got it.

1022
01:19:35,254 --> 01:19:38,924
You want to lock up poisoners?
This is the place to do it.

1023
01:19:40,885 --> 01:19:43,137
But you gotta take your time.

1024
01:19:43,387 --> 01:19:46,307
You'll make detective,
you'll grow wise.

1025
01:19:46,557 --> 01:19:49,643
And then you can change things.

1026
01:19:50,060 --> 01:19:52,730
But it's gotta be from the inside.

1027
01:19:56,108 --> 01:20:00,738
Let's go downtown to the station.
Talk to my guy, Stan.

1028
01:20:01,405 --> 01:20:04,825
He'll go through what you
gotta say to the D.A.

1029
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:57,336
What are we doing now?

1030
01:20:57,628 --> 01:21:02,007
I told an informant I'd take care
of his family for him.

1031
01:21:05,302 --> 01:21:07,888
Bring them food, stuff like that.

1032
01:21:08,138 --> 01:21:11,559
Gotta help out the family.

1033
01:21:12,142 --> 01:21:15,479
Believe it or not,
I do try to do some good.

1034
01:21:19,316 --> 01:21:21,443
You know where you're at, dog?

1035
01:21:27,449 --> 01:21:30,035
The fuck you looking at?

1036
01:22:05,446 --> 01:22:08,782
Hey, we got some things
for the family.

1037
01:22:21,712 --> 01:22:23,672
Kitchen's this way.

1038
01:22:31,096 --> 01:22:32,806
Put it on the counter.

1039
01:22:33,057 --> 01:22:36,310
- Where's the head?
- Right through.

1040
01:22:43,901 --> 01:22:48,030
I'm gonna go to the head.
Two seconds, we're gone.

1041
01:22:48,614 --> 01:22:51,283
Hey, let me get the CD player.

1042
01:22:52,785 --> 01:22:54,578
No, the CD player's mine.

1043
01:22:54,787 --> 01:22:56,247
Dreamer! Come here!

1044
01:22:58,165 --> 01:23:00,459
Count that shit, all right?

1045
01:23:01,502 --> 01:23:03,879
Thanks a lot, I was busy.

1046
01:23:04,129 --> 01:23:07,132
Learn how to count, fucking math whiz.

1047
01:23:09,927 --> 01:23:11,637
- You looked!
- I didn't.

1048
01:23:11,887 --> 01:23:14,390
You calling me a cheater, "ese"?

1049
01:23:14,682 --> 01:23:16,308
Deal again, Sniper.

1050
01:23:19,478 --> 01:23:21,689
You play cards, cop?

1051
01:23:21,939 --> 01:23:23,399
No, not really.

1052
01:23:23,649 --> 01:23:24,859
Want a beer?

1053
01:23:25,109 --> 01:23:26,402
Have a cold one.

1054
01:23:27,111 --> 01:23:29,071
No, thanks, I'm good.

1055
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:33,033
Come on, sit down.
Play a card game with us.

1056
01:23:33,284 --> 01:23:35,953
Don't be rude, "ese." You're a guest.

1057
01:23:36,162 --> 01:23:38,122
Why don't you play one hand?

1058
01:23:38,914 --> 01:23:41,375
Don't worry, we ain't betting money.

1059
01:23:41,625 --> 01:23:43,502
We gotta roll in a second.

1060
01:23:43,752 --> 01:23:45,754
Alonzo's taking a shit.

1061
01:23:49,091 --> 01:23:51,594
All right, I'll play one hand.

1062
01:23:52,553 --> 01:23:54,430
Is this five-card draw?

1063
01:23:55,055 --> 01:23:57,808
Yeah, jokers are wild.

1064
01:23:58,142 --> 01:24:00,561
Why don't you tell us something?

1065
01:24:00,811 --> 01:24:03,480
How long you been a pig?

1066
01:24:03,898 --> 01:24:06,066
My bad. My bad.

1067
01:24:06,358 --> 01:24:09,195
I meant a police officer.

1068
01:24:09,528 --> 01:24:11,614
I've been a pig for 19 months.

1069
01:24:11,864 --> 01:24:14,033
Is that right? You like it?

1070
01:24:14,283 --> 01:24:17,453
I should've been a fireman.
One more.

1071
01:24:20,581 --> 01:24:23,334
- What you got, dog?
- Three of a kind.

1072
01:24:23,584 --> 01:24:25,961
I didn't get shit.

1073
01:24:26,253 --> 01:24:28,214
Boo-ya, baby!

1074
01:24:28,964 --> 01:24:31,967
Two pair!

1075
01:24:34,762 --> 01:24:35,763
What the fuck?

1076
01:24:37,014 --> 01:24:38,265
He won.

1077
01:24:39,141 --> 01:24:41,602
I got two pair!

1078
01:24:42,269 --> 01:24:46,398
Three of a kind beats two pair,
you fucking dumb truck.

1079
01:24:48,484 --> 01:24:51,820
You're fucking stupid.
Take your medication.

1080
01:24:52,112 --> 01:24:54,490
Seriously. I know I'm number one.

1081
01:24:54,782 --> 01:24:59,245
See why we don't play for money?
Because of this "vato."

1082
01:24:59,954 --> 01:25:02,081
- Show me your "cohete."
- What?

1083
01:25:02,289 --> 01:25:05,918
Your gun, homes.
Underneath your shirt.

1084
01:25:06,377 --> 01:25:08,504
What is it, .380 stainless?

1085
01:25:08,754 --> 01:25:10,464
- 9mm Beretta.
- Like that?

1086
01:25:13,717 --> 01:25:15,427
- Just like it.
- Yeah?

1087
01:25:16,053 --> 01:25:17,596
Here's the problem.

1088
01:25:18,848 --> 01:25:22,017
I seen this one.
I want to see yours.

1089
01:25:23,602 --> 01:25:27,022
Come on, "ese,"
I ain't gonna shoot nobody.

1090
01:25:29,942 --> 01:25:32,278
Let me check it out.

1091
01:25:42,705 --> 01:25:44,790
Learn that in the Academy?

1092
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:47,793
Neat trick.
This is nice.

1093
01:25:48,043 --> 01:25:52,089
Nice.
You could fuck a "vato" up with this.

1094
01:25:54,258 --> 01:25:57,428
What you do is, you aim like that.

1095
01:26:01,140 --> 01:26:02,933
I'm just playing.

1096
01:26:03,184 --> 01:26:05,936
Yeah, I gotta go.
Alonzo!

1097
01:26:06,937 --> 01:26:08,981
Kick back and party.

1098
01:26:09,231 --> 01:26:11,775
Ain't nothing out there for you.

1099
01:26:12,026 --> 01:26:14,236
What are you talking about?

1100
01:26:17,448 --> 01:26:18,824
Hey, white boy.

1101
01:26:19,408 --> 01:26:23,537
If you ask me homes,
that's just, of course, if you ask...

1102
01:26:23,787 --> 01:26:25,789
...Alonzo played you, "ese."

1103
01:26:26,332 --> 01:26:28,584
Big time.

1104
01:26:28,959 --> 01:26:31,378
Wait, where you going?

1105
01:26:32,505 --> 01:26:35,341
It's your deal.

1106
01:26:45,142 --> 01:26:47,353
It's all there.

1107
01:26:47,770 --> 01:26:50,773
- Sure?
- You can count it yourself.

1108
01:26:56,195 --> 01:26:58,948
Alonzo pulled off a miracle.

1109
01:26:59,532 --> 01:27:01,909
Times are tight.
Scared up a lot of cash.

1110
01:27:02,159 --> 01:27:04,411
Who'd he jack, homes?

1111
01:27:04,912 --> 01:27:06,205
I don't know.

1112
01:27:10,084 --> 01:27:12,419
He jacked Roger.

1113
01:27:12,670 --> 01:27:14,213
Blasted that fool.

1114
01:27:14,421 --> 01:27:18,300
Alonzo's a low-down, ruthless "vato."

1115
01:27:18,551 --> 01:27:20,427
But I like that.

1116
01:27:22,388 --> 01:27:25,057
That's why I never shake his hand.

1117
01:27:25,391 --> 01:27:27,977
He don't respect "nada."

1118
01:27:28,227 --> 01:27:30,646
Know what the money's for?

1119
01:27:30,896 --> 01:27:33,983
Alonzo, he's a hothead.

1120
01:27:34,191 --> 01:27:37,611
Last week in Vegas, some Russian
starts talking shit.

1121
01:27:37,862 --> 01:27:40,781
Alonzo, he just snapped.

1122
01:27:41,031 --> 01:27:43,325
Beat his ass to death.

1123
01:27:43,576 --> 01:27:47,163
Turns out, that Russian,
he's a somebody.

1124
01:27:47,454 --> 01:27:52,334
Now, Alonzo's into the Russians
for a million.

1125
01:27:52,751 --> 01:27:54,712
How do you know that?

1126
01:27:58,716 --> 01:28:01,302
Alonzo has until tonight to pay up.

1127
01:28:01,552 --> 01:28:04,054
But he's still on their list.

1128
01:28:04,471 --> 01:28:07,308
Nobody thought he could
get the cash.

1129
01:28:08,392 --> 01:28:11,854
Good thing he did.
They're looking for him.

1130
01:28:12,813 --> 01:28:18,569
If he don't turn up downtown with
the cash by midnight....

1131
01:28:18,777 --> 01:28:20,487
Your "vato..."

1132
01:28:20,696 --> 01:28:22,072
...he's dead.

1133
01:28:22,948 --> 01:28:24,033
Hey, pig.

1134
01:28:24,283 --> 01:28:26,744
Ever had your shit pushed in?

1135
01:28:27,578 --> 01:28:28,954
Simple question.

1136
01:28:29,163 --> 01:28:30,414
- No?
- No.

1137
01:28:30,831 --> 01:28:33,375
- Had my shit pushed in.
- Yeah, man.

1138
01:28:33,626 --> 01:28:37,505
I had my shit pushed in, bro!

1139
01:28:37,755 --> 01:28:39,381
Big time!

1140
01:28:41,133 --> 01:28:42,760
Smiley?

1141
01:28:42,968 --> 01:28:46,889
Sure, I always get love
from the homeys.

1142
01:28:57,316 --> 01:28:59,109
You guys fucked him up!

1143
01:28:59,401 --> 01:29:00,694
Go next door.

1144
01:29:00,945 --> 01:29:03,197
Get the fuck out of here!

1145
01:29:05,449 --> 01:29:07,743
You fucked up.

1146
01:29:08,077 --> 01:29:09,954
You're under arrest!

1147
01:29:10,162 --> 01:29:14,792
For being a cop, dogging me
in the mouth in my own pad.

1148
01:29:15,376 --> 01:29:19,171
You got the right
to be bitch-slapped!

1149
01:29:22,633 --> 01:29:24,093
Drag him to the tub.

1150
01:29:24,301 --> 01:29:25,928
Punk motherfucker!

1151
01:29:28,430 --> 01:29:30,307
Raid his ass!

1152
01:29:52,830 --> 01:29:53,914
Do it!

1153
01:29:54,165 --> 01:29:55,875
It's gonna be loud.

1154
01:30:00,171 --> 01:30:01,964
Let me get his money.

1155
01:30:02,715 --> 01:30:04,425
- Wait.
- Hurry up.

1156
01:30:11,557 --> 01:30:13,517
Smiley, check it out.

1157
01:30:13,726 --> 01:30:16,145
Is that your little cousin?

1158
01:30:23,527 --> 01:30:25,946
- What's this?
- I found it!

1159
01:30:26,197 --> 01:30:27,823
- Who had it?
- I found it!

1160
01:30:28,616 --> 01:30:29,617
Where?

1161
01:30:29,867 --> 01:30:33,662
I found it in MacArthur Park!
MacArthur Park!

1162
01:30:38,709 --> 01:30:40,920
Wait up, I can't even see.

1163
01:30:41,128 --> 01:30:42,505
Shut the fuck up!

1164
01:30:42,755 --> 01:30:44,882
Get in your last prayer.

1165
01:30:45,090 --> 01:30:46,717
Listen to me, man.

1166
01:30:46,926 --> 01:30:48,552
She was being raped.

1167
01:30:48,761 --> 01:30:51,764
Two crackheads were attacking her...

1168
01:30:51,972 --> 01:30:54,892
...and I stopped them!
I swear to God!

1169
01:30:55,184 --> 01:30:58,979
- You're lying to me!
- I am not lying!

1170
01:30:59,396 --> 01:31:01,607
She was being raped!

1171
01:31:01,857 --> 01:31:03,150
I stopped them!

1172
01:31:03,442 --> 01:31:04,985
Please! I got a kid.

1173
01:31:05,236 --> 01:31:08,072
- Shut up, fag!
- Blast his ass.

1174
01:31:08,656 --> 01:31:11,992
I have a little girl!

1175
01:31:12,409 --> 01:31:13,702
Do it!

1176
01:31:15,371 --> 01:31:19,917
I'm gonna get to the bottom of your
bullshit. She's my cousin, homes.

1177
01:31:20,125 --> 01:31:22,086
Ain't right involving her.

1178
01:31:22,336 --> 01:31:23,379
You fucked up.

1179
01:31:27,883 --> 01:31:30,052
If you're lying to me...

1180
01:31:30,302 --> 01:31:31,929
...I blow your balls off.

1181
01:31:32,137 --> 01:31:33,764
<i>- Hello.</i>
- Hey, Letty.

1182
01:31:33,973 --> 01:31:35,933
- What's up?
<i>- Hey, Smiley.</i>

1183
01:31:36,141 --> 01:31:38,894
Just doing homework. You want Tony?

1184
01:31:39,144 --> 01:31:40,521
No, I want you.

1185
01:31:40,729 --> 01:31:43,732
- You go to school today?
- Yeah.

1186
01:31:44,149 --> 01:31:46,235
- You didn't ditch?
<i>- Nope.</i>

1187
01:31:46,485 --> 01:31:49,071
I went to every class. Why?

1188
01:31:49,363 --> 01:31:51,240
I heard different.

1189
01:31:53,826 --> 01:31:55,703
Cops talk to you today?

1190
01:31:58,789 --> 01:32:01,625
- No, no.
<i>- All right, Letty...</i>

1191
01:32:01,876 --> 01:32:03,419
...don't bullshit me.

1192
01:32:07,882 --> 01:32:10,426
I got jumped by two crackheads.

1193
01:32:10,676 --> 01:32:14,889
- You got jumped?
<i>- I think they wanted to rape me.</i>

1194
01:32:15,097 --> 01:32:17,433
<i>But nothing happened, okay?</i>

1195
01:32:17,683 --> 01:32:19,685
Because this cop came.

1196
01:32:19,935 --> 01:32:22,104
<i>They almost killed him...</i>

1197
01:32:22,354 --> 01:32:24,398
<i>...but he kicked their ass.</i>

1198
01:32:24,648 --> 01:32:26,025
Describe him.

1199
01:32:27,276 --> 01:32:30,779
He was a white boy.
He looked real young.

1200
01:32:31,405 --> 01:32:33,991
- You're okay?
<i>- Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

1201
01:32:34,283 --> 01:32:35,576
- Hey, Letty.
- Yeah?

1202
01:32:35,826 --> 01:32:37,077
We're not done.

1203
01:32:37,495 --> 01:32:38,496
Okay.

1204
01:32:39,872 --> 01:32:40,998
What's up?

1205
01:32:41,624 --> 01:32:43,000
You gonna blast him?

1206
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:48,172
"Vato" was telling the truth.

1207
01:32:48,422 --> 01:32:50,132
Life's a trip, "que no"?

1208
01:32:50,508 --> 01:32:52,468
This is some trippy shit.

1209
01:33:06,815 --> 01:33:09,652
That's for getting my cousin's back.

1210
01:33:11,362 --> 01:33:14,532
Cover your head.
You'll mess up my floor.

1211
01:33:15,407 --> 01:33:18,327
You know this was just
business, right?

1212
01:33:21,956 --> 01:33:23,749
Right?

1213
01:33:25,417 --> 01:33:27,378
Right.

1214
01:34:41,202 --> 01:34:45,039
What you doing here?
You know you don't belong here.

1215
01:34:49,126 --> 01:34:51,879
- What's up?
- Must be lost, motherfucker!

1216
01:34:53,214 --> 01:34:56,300
Gonna need more than that
up in here, boy!

1217
01:35:09,230 --> 01:35:11,440
You got business here, rookie?

1218
01:35:11,857 --> 01:35:13,943
I'm here for Alonzo.

1219
01:36:23,888 --> 01:36:26,724
Hey. Is your dad home?

1220
01:36:26,932 --> 01:36:29,268
- ln the bedroom.
- He's in the bedroom?

1221
01:36:29,518 --> 01:36:32,188
All right, you wanna open up the door?

1222
01:36:32,396 --> 01:36:36,025
Okay. Thanks. You watching TV?

1223
01:36:37,318 --> 01:36:38,944
Yeah, anything good on?

1224
01:36:47,578 --> 01:36:50,956
- Do you want me to call my mom?
- No, I don't.

1225
01:36:52,124 --> 01:36:54,084
I'll tell you what I want.

1226
01:36:54,752 --> 01:36:56,545
Find a good hiding spot.

1227
01:36:56,754 --> 01:36:59,590
Do you have a favorite place to hide?

1228
01:37:00,508 --> 01:37:04,011
- The closet.
- ln the closet? That's perfect.

1229
01:37:04,595 --> 01:37:08,516
Okay, open up the closet.
All right. Good, good.

1230
01:37:08,766 --> 01:37:10,976
Can you sit down in there?

1231
01:37:11,393 --> 01:37:15,439
All right. Now stay in here
and be very quiet.

1232
01:37:16,190 --> 01:37:18,442
I'll be right back. All right?

1233
01:37:46,011 --> 01:37:47,805
It's all good, baby.

1234
01:37:55,437 --> 01:37:56,981
You, against the wall.

1235
01:37:57,189 --> 01:38:00,526
Move real slow.
Put the money in that bag...

1236
01:38:00,734 --> 01:38:04,780
...take your weapons and place them
inside that pillowcase.

1237
01:38:06,782 --> 01:38:10,661
Congratulations, son. You made it.

1238
01:38:10,953 --> 01:38:13,164
You passed the test. You're a narc.

1239
01:38:13,414 --> 01:38:16,876
Put the gun down before you give
her a heart attack.

1240
01:38:17,126 --> 01:38:19,503
I said put the money in that bag.

1241
01:38:19,753 --> 01:38:22,840
Place your weapons
inside that pillowcase.

1242
01:38:23,090 --> 01:38:26,093
Fuck your appointment
with the Russians.

1243
01:38:26,343 --> 01:38:28,470
Oh, okay.

1244
01:38:29,471 --> 01:38:31,849
Okay. Hand me the pillowcase, baby.

1245
01:38:32,516 --> 01:38:34,643
Baby! Hand me the pillowcase.

1246
01:38:35,352 --> 01:38:36,812
You're gonna book me?

1247
01:38:37,271 --> 01:38:38,814
You smoked the dust.

1248
01:38:39,023 --> 01:38:42,902
You ran out, and you're the one
that shot Roger.

1249
01:38:44,486 --> 01:38:47,489
- Here you go.
- And the one on your ankle?

1250
01:38:48,073 --> 01:38:50,743
Want the one in my back pocket too?

1251
01:38:54,580 --> 01:38:56,957
One problem: You got no witnesses.

1252
01:38:57,208 --> 01:39:00,961
Who are your witnesses, huh?
Roger? Smiley?

1253
01:39:01,212 --> 01:39:02,922
You think they'll help you?

1254
01:39:03,547 --> 01:39:08,177
It's not what you know.
It's what you can prove.

1255
01:39:11,931 --> 01:39:14,767
What can you prove, huh? Nothing.

1256
01:39:15,017 --> 01:39:17,102
- Where's your evidence?
- There.

1257
01:39:20,814 --> 01:39:21,899
Oh, shit!

1258
01:39:27,112 --> 01:39:29,073
It's on now, Jake.

1259
01:39:30,366 --> 01:39:31,742
Don't move.

1260
01:39:34,453 --> 01:39:36,080
Where you at, Jake?

1261
01:39:37,039 --> 01:39:38,082
Come on out, dog!

1262
01:39:51,554 --> 01:39:54,723
- Ah! I see you.
- Shit!

1263
01:40:00,729 --> 01:40:04,066
I'm surgical with this bitch.
How you want it?

1264
01:40:04,316 --> 01:40:08,612
That fool in the wheelchair?
How you think he got there?

1265
01:40:11,240 --> 01:40:14,326
- Mommy.
- Alonzito!

1266
01:40:17,246 --> 01:40:18,539
You see what I see?

1267
01:40:19,498 --> 01:40:23,711
Officer Hoyt, job number one:
Preserve life.

1268
01:40:23,919 --> 01:40:26,589
There's my son. Don't hurt him.

1269
01:40:26,839 --> 01:40:29,008
We're walking out together.

1270
01:40:47,818 --> 01:40:50,654
Alonzito! Alonzito!

1271
01:40:55,618 --> 01:40:57,828
- You all right?
- I want my mommy.

1272
01:40:58,078 --> 01:40:59,622
I know, I know, I know.

1273
01:40:59,830 --> 01:41:02,291
Just sit tight, all right?

1274
01:41:02,541 --> 01:41:06,212
It's gonna be all right. I know.

1275
01:41:07,379 --> 01:41:09,256
Shut the fuck up!

1276
01:41:12,051 --> 01:41:15,304
All right, let me see your hands!
Where is he?

1277
01:41:16,055 --> 01:41:17,681
- The window.
- Come on!

1278
01:41:17,932 --> 01:41:20,184
- Get your kid, stay down.
- Alonzito!

1279
01:46:22,528 --> 01:46:24,488
Hey, man, you tripping?

1280
01:46:24,822 --> 01:46:27,908
It's no fun when the rabbit
has the gun, is it?

1281
01:46:29,618 --> 01:46:31,162
My nigga.

1282
01:46:34,165 --> 01:46:38,294
Hey, first Damu puts one
in his head...

1283
01:46:39,962 --> 01:46:42,006
...l'll make you a rich man!

1284
01:46:43,048 --> 01:46:44,508
Come on now.

1285
01:46:44,717 --> 01:46:45,885
Who wanna get paid?

1286
01:46:47,803 --> 01:46:49,346
Who wanna get paid?

1287
01:46:53,267 --> 01:46:54,977
They're not like you.

1288
01:46:56,020 --> 01:46:58,230
You know what I learned today?

1289
01:46:58,981 --> 01:47:03,194
- I'm not like you.
- That's good. I'm glad to hear that.

1290
01:47:04,570 --> 01:47:08,365
Good. So, what now? Huh?

1291
01:47:09,533 --> 01:47:11,410
What you gonna do, shoot me?

1292
01:47:11,619 --> 01:47:14,455
You gonna bust your cherry
killing a cop?

1293
01:47:20,294 --> 01:47:21,837
There it is, Jake.

1294
01:47:23,714 --> 01:47:24,715
Hit me.

1295
01:47:26,133 --> 01:47:30,429
You never killed nobody before.
It ain't like stepping on ants.

1296
01:47:30,971 --> 01:47:32,598
Takes a man to kill.

1297
01:47:34,350 --> 01:47:36,352
Are you man enough to kill?

1298
01:47:38,771 --> 01:47:39,980
Hit me right there.

1299
01:47:44,485 --> 01:47:48,405
Get me, Jake. Get me.
Hit me. Hit me.

1300
01:47:48,656 --> 01:47:53,369
You can't do it.
Somebody drop this fool for me.

1301
01:48:10,302 --> 01:48:14,348
You got us twisted.
You got to put your own work in.

1302
01:48:15,599 --> 01:48:19,311
- All right. It's like that, Bone?
- It's like that.

1303
01:48:23,148 --> 01:48:26,735
Player to player, pimp to pimp.

1304
01:48:26,944 --> 01:48:29,780
- I don't believe you'd shoot me.
- Don't do it.

1305
01:48:31,115 --> 01:48:34,118
- Don't.
- I don't believe you got it in you.

1306
01:48:45,045 --> 01:48:47,965
I'm gonna get that gun and that money.

1307
01:48:48,257 --> 01:48:50,217
You ain't gonna do a thing.

1308
01:48:50,426 --> 01:48:53,679
You ain't gonna shoot no cop
in the back.

1309
01:48:54,638 --> 01:48:57,016
- Don't do it.
- You know what you'd get?

1310
01:48:57,308 --> 01:49:00,644
The gas chamber.
You know what it smells like?

1311
01:49:00,895 --> 01:49:05,191
Pine oil. That's where you headed,
to pine oil heaven.

1312
01:49:05,399 --> 01:49:07,985
I'm gonna get that gun and that money.

1313
01:49:08,235 --> 01:49:11,697
I don't think you got it in you.
I'm gonna go get it.

1314
01:49:13,324 --> 01:49:17,244
Shit! Ah, you motherfucker!

1315
01:49:17,745 --> 01:49:19,705
The next one will kill you.

1316
01:49:19,914 --> 01:49:23,167
Son of a bitch!
You shot me in the ass!

1317
01:49:23,375 --> 01:49:24,919
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

1318
01:49:25,127 --> 01:49:26,587
Okay, okay.

1319
01:49:26,837 --> 01:49:30,508
All right. Come on, I need
the money. Give me the money.

1320
01:49:31,383 --> 01:49:34,470
- Give me that money!
- It's not gonna happen.

1321
01:49:35,387 --> 01:49:37,890
You gonna take my own money from me?

1322
01:49:38,182 --> 01:49:41,810
That's my evidence.
You wanna go to jail or go home?

1323
01:49:44,563 --> 01:49:46,190
I wanna go home, Jake.

1324
01:49:48,108 --> 01:49:51,028
Give me the money,
and let me go home.

1325
01:49:51,278 --> 01:49:54,365
- You wanna go home?
- Yeah, let me go home, Jake.

1326
01:49:54,573 --> 01:49:56,784
Give me the money,
and let me go.

1327
01:49:58,452 --> 01:50:01,455
Give me the money,
and let me go home, Jake.

1328
01:50:01,664 --> 01:50:03,123
That's right, come on.

1329
01:50:06,585 --> 01:50:08,379
You don't deserve this.

1330
01:50:09,839 --> 01:50:11,131
Okay, motherfucker.

1331
01:50:16,971 --> 01:50:18,848
Jake, go and bounce, homey.

1332
01:50:19,098 --> 01:50:22,101
Get up out of here. We got your back.

1333
01:50:23,185 --> 01:50:24,270
What?

1334
01:50:24,520 --> 01:50:27,189
- It's like that.
- Oh, no, you didn't!

1335
01:50:27,398 --> 01:50:31,068
Wait a minute! No, you--
Hey, hey, Jake!

1336
01:50:31,318 --> 01:50:34,780
Hey! Jake! Jake!

1337
01:50:35,030 --> 01:50:36,991
Jake, come back here!

1338
01:50:38,450 --> 01:50:39,618
Jake!

1339
01:50:42,204 --> 01:50:45,457
You disloyal, fool-ass,
bitch-made punk.

1340
01:50:47,710 --> 01:50:49,587
I need my money!

1341
01:50:52,047 --> 01:50:53,424
Jake!

1342
01:50:56,427 --> 01:51:00,181
Oh, you motherfuckers! Okay.

1343
01:51:00,556 --> 01:51:04,059
All right! I'm putting cases
on all you bitches!

1344
01:51:04,310 --> 01:51:07,646
Huh? You think you can do this shit?
Jake!

1345
01:51:08,522 --> 01:51:10,900
You think you can do this to me?!

1346
01:51:11,817 --> 01:51:15,779
You motherfuckers will be playing
basketball in Pelican Bay...

1347
01:51:16,030 --> 01:51:18,365
...when I get finished with you!

1348
01:51:18,949 --> 01:51:21,076
Shoe program, nigga!

1349
01:51:21,785 --> 01:51:23,996
Twenty-three hour lock-down!

1350
01:51:24,205 --> 01:51:26,332
I'm the man up in this piece!

1351
01:51:26,999 --> 01:51:30,002
Who you think you fucking with?!

1352
01:51:30,211 --> 01:51:34,924
I'm the police! I run shit here!
You just live here!

1353
01:51:36,091 --> 01:51:38,594
That's right, you better walk away.

1354
01:51:38,844 --> 01:51:41,514
I'm gonna burn this motherfucker down!

1355
01:51:42,097 --> 01:51:45,893
King Kong ain't got shit on me!

1356
01:51:57,655 --> 01:52:00,407
That's all right. That's all right.

1357
01:52:00,658 --> 01:52:02,701
Shit, I don't fuck--

1358
01:52:02,910 --> 01:52:06,247
I'm winning anyway. I'm winning.

1359
01:52:07,122 --> 01:52:09,959
I'm winning anyway. I can't lose.

1360
01:52:10,501 --> 01:52:14,713
Shit, you can shoot me,
but you can't kill me.

1361
01:52:20,845 --> 01:52:23,138
Oh, what a day.

1362
01:52:23,389 --> 01:52:25,474
