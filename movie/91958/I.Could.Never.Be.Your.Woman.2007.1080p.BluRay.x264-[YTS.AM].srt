1
00:01:09,098 --> 00:01:10,565
Pretty impressive..... huh!

2
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:14,695
People tend to think of me
as that environmental ...nut!

3
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:16,899
But whenever I get
down to work they say...

4
00:01:16,972 --> 00:01:19,463
"Mother nature you are such a
destructive bitch!"

5
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:22,170
Well, what you see is disaster

6
00:01:22,211 --> 00:01:25,078
I see as laying the groundwork for
the next generation.

7
00:01:25,714 --> 00:01:28,888
You have to grow the new food,
for the new animals

8
00:01:29,084 --> 00:01:32,212
The big ones eat the small ones, and on
top of the food chain are the humans.

9
00:01:32,288 --> 00:01:34,483
Who used to be very grateful.

10
00:01:34,924 --> 00:01:36,152
And it was good working just fine.

11
00:01:36,191 --> 00:01:39,854
Until one self centered
generation came along.

12
00:01:40,429 --> 00:01:41,726
The baby-boomers.

13
00:01:42,231 --> 00:01:44,832
And these pampered postwar pinheads

14
00:01:45,167 --> 00:01:47,465
Thought that they could
just breeze through life

15
00:01:47,466 --> 00:01:49,763
do what every the hell they wanted.

16
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:51,228
For instance...

17
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:53,633
When the men would normally go to war.

18
00:01:53,824 --> 00:01:56,228
You know all the male
aggression servers a purpose.

19
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:57,761
It keeps the herd strong.

20
00:01:57,861 --> 00:02:00,906
But these guys said
"I don't like this particular war."

21
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,550
"I think I'll stay home."

22
00:02:02,688 --> 00:02:06,117
And when it was time for the
woman to stop jerkin' around and

23
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:07,751
start having babies they said

24
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:11,400
"We want to get our careers going
first babies can wait till later."

25
00:02:11,593 --> 00:02:13,568
They grew up to be obsessed with money

26
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:15,870
and accumulated useless possessions.

27
00:02:16,065 --> 00:02:19,577
Did they care that they were
depleting natural resources,

28
00:02:19,578 --> 00:02:23,089
and polluting the water,
and ripping holes in the frickin' sky!

29
00:02:23,172 --> 00:02:24,571
But I've got them now.

30
00:02:25,207 --> 00:02:27,402
Oh yes, yes, yes.
Because now, now...

31
00:02:27,776 --> 00:02:28,572
They going to get old.

32
00:02:29,778 --> 00:02:30,767
There not going they to like it.

33
00:02:30,813 --> 00:02:33,077
There going to be
"Oh, I don't want to waddle."

34
00:02:33,115 --> 00:02:36,394
Their taking bits of their ass
their putting it in their face.

35
00:02:36,395 --> 00:02:38,387
This is not natural.
It's not natural.

36
00:02:38,721 --> 00:02:42,053
And their going to say, "Oh no, no, see,
we do not want to get old. No.

37
00:02:42,054 --> 00:02:45,095
We want to stay young forever.
Forever and ever."

38
00:02:45,227 --> 00:02:47,977
You know what I'm going to say to them?
You know what I say to them?

39
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,926
Tough SHIT!

40
00:04:09,024 --> 00:04:11,006
Here's a pal of mine in her 40's,

41
00:04:11,206 --> 00:04:13,972
trying to moisturize her way
back to her way back to 30.

42
00:04:14,903 --> 00:04:19,015
But unfortunately her ex-husband
found him self a wife in her 20's.

43
00:04:19,016 --> 00:04:20,894
- Hi Mom!
- Where were you guys?

44
00:04:21,156 --> 00:04:24,455
We went all the way to Malibu
and dropped Sara off at Gail's house.

45
00:04:24,503 --> 00:04:27,203
And then went to Beverly Hills
to drop off Glen.

46
00:04:27,296 --> 00:04:29,644
But they said they'd
rather have their own kids.

47
00:04:29,665 --> 00:04:31,990
Yeah, I forgot which kid
went with which one.

48
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:34,797
How 'bout oldest kid with oldest
Mom and work down from there.

49
00:04:39,814 --> 00:04:41,037
What happened to your head?

50
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:43,594
Oh, I had to have some plugs removed

51
00:04:43,595 --> 00:04:47,354
because the hairs were growing
into my head instead of out of it.

52
00:04:48,269 --> 00:04:49,259
Where you go with that?

53
00:04:49,818 --> 00:04:50,518
What?

54
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,282
Oh I...
This is mine I got it in Pasadena.

55
00:04:53,283 --> 00:04:56,416
And you didn't have your wallet,
as usual, so I bought it.

56
00:04:56,417 --> 00:04:59,049
Because I was wearing sweatpants.
I don't have pockets.

57
00:04:59,113 --> 00:05:02,430
For someone who never exercises
you're always in sweatsuits.

58
00:05:02,431 --> 00:05:05,316
Like wearing workout cloths
will make you in shape.

59
00:05:05,317 --> 00:05:08,665
Well do you think wearing "Doc Martins"
will make you a teenager?

60
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,632
I don't know. Do you think
wearing you're hat backwards

61
00:05:10,633 --> 00:05:12,493
will make you look more mature?

62
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,591
Well do you think
wearing a sleeveless

63
00:05:16,743 --> 00:05:18,911
t-shirt makes you look
like a big bull-dike?

64
00:05:20,055 --> 00:05:22,122
Izzie says you've just been
writing all weekend?

65
00:05:23,152 --> 00:05:24,103
No dates?

66
00:05:24,153 --> 00:05:25,882
No prospects on the horizon?

67
00:05:25,932 --> 00:05:26,796
No

68
00:05:27,071 --> 00:05:28,974
Oh Rosie you've got to get over me.

69
00:05:29,146 --> 00:05:30,513
I'm only human.

70
00:05:32,241 --> 00:05:33,230
You know what Rosie,

71
00:05:33,744 --> 00:05:36,586
you shouldn't be alone.
I'm going to fix you up with somebody.

72
00:05:36,963 --> 00:05:39,063
- You've kept your looks.
- Thanks.

73
00:05:39,264 --> 00:05:42,227
Ma, he got the
"Welcome Back Kotter" game.

74
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:48,813
- Lindsay I love you.
- Oh thank you Orlando.

75
00:05:48,957 --> 00:05:51,395
Hey, you said you loved me!

76
00:05:51,408 --> 00:05:52,484
He never said that!

77
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:55,455
And wearing a wedding dress
isn't going to change his mind.

78
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,136
But you do!
I know you do!

79
00:05:58,716 --> 00:06:00,847
Orlando let's go to the beach.

80
00:06:00,848 --> 00:06:02,490
Hey! Get away, He's mine

81
00:06:02,615 --> 00:06:04,531
He said you have an ugly body.

82
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:09,097
It's exactly the same as yours.
And that dress is so ghetto.

83
00:06:09,834 --> 00:06:10,725
What's that mean?

84
00:06:11,484 --> 00:06:14,223
Oh well in school if something's
cheesy we called it ghetto.

85
00:06:14,321 --> 00:06:16,804
But honey, that's like making
fun of the under-privileged.

86
00:06:16,806 --> 00:06:19,922
Like you know, naming ugly
cloths after their neighborhood.

87
00:06:19,975 --> 00:06:21,133
I didn't make it up.

88
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:23,343
Leaves my man alone!

89
00:06:23,443 --> 00:06:25,425
I think you're really nice.
You want to go swim?

90
00:06:25,873 --> 00:06:27,648
Why's she suddenly so happy?

91
00:06:27,709 --> 00:06:29,138
She is manic-depressive.

92
00:06:29,608 --> 00:06:31,734
Hey Ma, how do you know
when it's true love?

93
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:36,159
Usually you make the music louder,
and you can move in on them.

94
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,661
Or some times they
look up in slow motion.

95
00:06:38,742 --> 00:06:40,651
No on TV, in real life.

96
00:06:41,191 --> 00:06:42,234
Real life?

97
00:06:44,561 --> 00:06:47,568
Izz, why is there a Ken doll
in the heat vent?

98
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:50,006
Remember when you had
Alzheimer's and you wandered off.

99
00:06:51,734 --> 00:06:54,299
You know I'm starting to
not care so much about Barbies.

100
00:06:54,611 --> 00:06:56,363
But she's just getting
her life together.

101
00:06:56,364 --> 00:06:59,695
She's got a jeep, she's got a horse,
a recording studio.

102
00:06:59,696 --> 00:07:02,911
Yeah, but you know,
it's make believe it's not satisfying.

103
00:07:06,367 --> 00:07:08,211
Doggin' me all week dog.

104
00:07:09,681 --> 00:07:12,093
Doggin' me all week dude.

105
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,455
Brother...
Gee...

106
00:07:15,159 --> 00:07:16,916
- Izzie?
- What?

107
00:07:16,917 --> 00:07:18,746
Do people still say Gee?

108
00:07:18,747 --> 00:07:23,132
Sure today I said,
"Gee, I can't wait for lunch."

109
00:07:25,917 --> 00:07:29,114
Dog don't go fronting like you
didn't blow on your cheddar

110
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,734
smokes so you can roll
with Flynn and his peeps.

111
00:07:32,107 --> 00:07:33,423
You know he just playin' you.

112
00:07:33,523 --> 00:07:35,578
I think you really
need to step off that.

113
00:07:35,678 --> 00:07:38,142
Just remember me and
Ross are your real blood.

114
00:07:38,507 --> 00:07:41,148
We don't have to smoke mad
trees to think you all that.

115
00:07:43,358 --> 00:07:44,058
Wait!

116
00:07:46,418 --> 00:07:48,663
You're right.
I been trippin'.

117
00:07:48,982 --> 00:07:51,066
You know there's no one
I'd rather roll with.

118
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,525
Cut!
Great!

119
00:08:00,843 --> 00:08:03,404
Was there too much slang,
you know, for the emotion?

120
00:08:03,405 --> 00:08:05,925
I liked that bit about
smoking the mad trees.

121
00:08:06,744 --> 00:08:08,990
You were good.
You gave me allot.

122
00:08:09,351 --> 00:08:11,093
You were good.
You gave him allot.

123
00:08:11,163 --> 00:08:12,160
It's really coming out.

124
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,574
- So good.
- Hey hey, drop off your phones.

125
00:08:14,575 --> 00:08:16,839
- Marty, need Rosie.
- Wow.

126
00:08:17,696 --> 00:08:18,396
You got it.

127
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:19,698
This is so cute.
Where did you get this?

128
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,749
Sorry Rosie,
president of comedy needs to see you.

129
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,373
- Oh, OK.
- Bye. Bye

130
00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:25,787
Hey, let's go find Mommy.

131
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:31,507
Bowling is so 8-1-8.

132
00:08:32,119 --> 00:08:34,429
And these balls are so heavy.

133
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,405
- There.
- Where?

134
00:08:36,836 --> 00:08:38,376
The balls are so heavy?

135
00:08:38,975 --> 00:08:40,270
Yeah well their bowling balls.

136
00:08:40,535 --> 00:08:42,309
- It's an innuendo.
- Oh, come...

137
00:08:42,484 --> 00:08:44,925
It implies she holds men's testicles.

138
00:08:44,984 --> 00:08:47,218
And rolls them down a wooden lane.

139
00:08:47,377 --> 00:08:50,381
- Ah just loose her.
- It's Jeannie my secretary.

140
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:52,845
- She'll be heartbroken.
- That's it for me.

141
00:08:53,976 --> 00:08:57,018
They make much dirtier jokes on
"Will And Grace" and "Housewives".

142
00:08:57,019 --> 00:08:58,507
You never stand up to him.

143
00:08:58,527 --> 00:08:59,624
It's all a game.

144
00:08:59,768 --> 00:09:02,366
Are you developing another
talent contest show?

145
00:09:02,451 --> 00:09:03,151
Where?

146
00:09:03,235 --> 00:09:04,811
New faces of 2006.

147
00:09:04,857 --> 00:09:07,420
Oh, that's my plastic surgery show.

148
00:09:07,857 --> 00:09:10,140
You know it's amazing
what they can suck out.

149
00:09:10,356 --> 00:09:13,519
He get's his eyes done,
marries a 28 year old and you know,

150
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,682
he thinks he's suddenly
turned into a young hipster.

151
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:20,691
Well, and you think maintaining your high
school weight makes you a cheerleader.

152
00:09:20,692 --> 00:09:21,692
Your both wrong.

153
00:09:22,132 --> 00:09:27,938
You can jump and peel and nip and tuck
but your insides are still rotting away.

154
00:09:28,313 --> 00:09:30,907
Hey, there's something new to makeover.

155
00:09:31,253 --> 00:09:32,809
Internal organs.

156
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,818
Yeah, you can have a liver lift.

157
00:09:34,819 --> 00:09:38,705
Hey, a pancreatic resurfacing
or a colon peel.

158
00:09:38,727 --> 00:09:42,925
Yeah, botox you're ovaries baby.
Then you'll look young in your x-rays.

159
00:09:46,483 --> 00:09:50,018
He's at Lakers games with
Cameron Diaz and Justin Timberlake.

160
00:09:50,118 --> 00:09:52,720
He's trout fishing with Norm MacDonald.

161
00:09:53,127 --> 00:09:55,946
I am the one behind closed doors
all afternoon and who have I met?

162
00:09:56,601 --> 00:09:59,460
Yeah I thought that meant secrets
from his wife, not the whole town.

163
00:10:00,658 --> 00:10:01,990
I'll talk to you later Ma.

164
00:10:02,689 --> 00:10:03,768
Anyone call?

165
00:10:04,109 --> 00:10:05,318
Look what I made of Brianna.

166
00:10:06,284 --> 00:10:08,958
I already did Sean.
It's hilarious.

167
00:10:10,723 --> 00:10:13,857
Uh, we had to make some
changes to this weeks episode.

168
00:10:13,858 --> 00:10:16,287
Your line in the bowling alley was cut.

169
00:10:16,878 --> 00:10:19,383
Oh... You have to do
what's better for the show.

170
00:10:19,384 --> 00:10:21,981
It was the censor.
He thought you were too sexy.

171
00:10:23,024 --> 00:10:24,891
- I'm sorry.
- That's fine. Forget it.

172
00:10:24,951 --> 00:10:28,053
Ok. All right, well I'm going to go get
Izz, if anyone needs me I'm on my cell.

173
00:10:28,197 --> 00:10:28,897
Sure.

174
00:10:31,466 --> 00:10:33,001
- You go girl.
- Hey, is Rosie there?

175
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:34,165
No you just missed her.

176
00:10:34,412 --> 00:10:36,311
She had and emergency botox appointment.

177
00:10:36,587 --> 00:10:37,315
<i>You are bad.</i>

178
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:53,366
No Izzie, don't hover over Dylan.
Do something else.

179
00:10:56,404 --> 00:10:59,317
- Hi Britney.
- That's it, talk to the girls not him.

180
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:02,828
Bitches!

181
00:11:04,632 --> 00:11:05,960
No. No no no no.

182
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:07,349
Izz!

183
00:11:08,233 --> 00:11:09,790
- Bye Dylan.
- Yeah.

184
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:12,537
Hey!

185
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,610
- Ma, you know what happened today?
- What?

186
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:19,612
I went to the bathroom and there was
this brownish spot,

187
00:11:19,613 --> 00:11:21,863
but it wasn't from you know where.

188
00:11:22,295 --> 00:11:24,286
Honey, that is your period.

189
00:11:27,336 --> 00:11:31,603
Oh congratulations, your...
your a woman!

190
00:11:31,751 --> 00:11:33,474
Let the game begin!

191
00:11:35,937 --> 00:11:39,598
Ma what's is better?
Maxi with wings for extra protection,

192
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:42,012
or absorbent dry and bulge your pants?

193
00:11:42,347 --> 00:11:43,707
How many light days are there?

194
00:11:43,806 --> 00:11:45,569
Honey, you do not need all this.

195
00:11:45,768 --> 00:11:47,343
- Can I have a Twix bar?
- Yeah.

196
00:11:51,186 --> 00:11:54,121
<i>Ops, I got a career...</i>

197
00:11:54,363 --> 00:11:58,794
<i>by shaking my rear,
and making guys leer.</i>

198
00:11:59,362 --> 00:12:03,725
<i>Oh baby baby.
Ops I'm going to sing more,</i>

199
00:12:04,095 --> 00:12:07,362
<i>and dance like a whore.</i>

200
00:12:07,636 --> 00:12:10,534
<i>I'm just not talented.</i>

201
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:12,260
Izz, look what I found.

202
00:12:12,746 --> 00:12:14,369
They gave us these in the sixth grade.

203
00:12:15,513 --> 00:12:16,213
See...

204
00:12:16,905 --> 00:12:18,338
It's Mindy Menstruation.

205
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:22,144
Here she is staying clean.
And here she is eating right.

206
00:12:22,162 --> 00:12:23,453
Oh, I like her hair better here.

207
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:27,460
With her Modes pads, nobody knows
about the gusher between her legs.

208
00:12:28,256 --> 00:12:29,386
When can I have sex?

209
00:12:30,473 --> 00:12:34,415
Uh uh....
When you? get your masters degree.

210
00:12:34,598 --> 00:12:35,690
No, come on, really.

211
00:12:35,807 --> 00:12:38,132
When you go to college.
Eighteen.

212
00:12:38,711 --> 00:12:39,973
Ma fifteen.

213
00:12:40,172 --> 00:12:40,872
No way!

214
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:43,645
Maybe... seventeen.

215
00:12:43,771 --> 00:12:46,239
Ma fifteen is the new seventeen.

216
00:12:46,962 --> 00:12:49,568
Tonight, Yomena faces a personal crisis

217
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:53,601
on a very special "You Go Girl" that
teens should watch with their parents.

218
00:12:53,893 --> 00:12:55,854
Quick, call your mom.

219
00:13:03,273 --> 00:13:04,205
Izzie!

220
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:09,235
It's not the music.
It's driving me crazy.

221
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:11,688
- It's "Apes Escapes."
- Ma it's Dylan's favorite game.

222
00:13:11,689 --> 00:13:14,148
I have to get good at it so
we will have something in common.

223
00:13:14,192 --> 00:13:17,127
Oh, sounds like a
firm basis for a relationship.

224
00:13:17,181 --> 00:13:19,703
- Now I'll walk you home.
- I have to sleep over.

225
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,184
My father's shooting the
country music awards tonight.

226
00:13:22,239 --> 00:13:25,341
Just do something quiet so
Izz can finish her homework.

227
00:13:33,828 --> 00:13:37,165
How the hell do you drop
two points from the "Candy Strippers"?

228
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:38,885
From now on no more issues.

229
00:13:38,886 --> 00:13:42,971
No drugs, no teen pregnancies,
no homosexuals.

230
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,904
What about the same sex prom date?

231
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,906
Oh yeck!
No homo stuff!

232
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,709
Except maybe an occasional lesbian kiss.

233
00:13:50,801 --> 00:13:54,830
But no eating disorders,
no racial strife.

234
00:13:55,102 --> 00:13:58,563
Come on, let's get on it.
No more janky shows.

235
00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:02,147
Never heard that word did ya'?

236
00:14:02,606 --> 00:14:05,671
We hired this consulting team
the next thing they tell us

237
00:14:06,181 --> 00:14:07,729
all the hot new trends.

238
00:14:08,009 --> 00:14:12,499
Ok, we drop the prom, we move up.
Boys make over the nerdy guy...

239
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,806
No. No, that was just a backup script.

240
00:14:14,994 --> 00:14:17,989
- Make overs are big.
- Make overs are so played out.

241
00:14:18,237 --> 00:14:20,302
Plastic surgery makeovers, uh...

242
00:14:20,303 --> 00:14:22,635
queer makeovers, straight
make overs, house makeovers,

243
00:14:22,636 --> 00:14:25,003
car makeovers there's
nothing more to say about it.

244
00:14:25,103 --> 00:14:26,195
You can do it.

245
00:14:26,594 --> 00:14:28,633
Let us make this show cronk.

246
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:29,535
Groove.

247
00:14:30,826 --> 00:14:33,467
Oh, and while we're in full comunicado

248
00:14:33,468 --> 00:14:36,108
I want you to incorporate
these into the show.

249
00:14:36,181 --> 00:14:38,637
We just covered there phones
with matching jewels.

250
00:14:38,652 --> 00:14:40,133
These are the cool new ones.

251
00:14:40,134 --> 00:14:43,798
I read in Newsweek where kids
text message more than talk.

252
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,605
- Is that a fact.
- Indeed.

253
00:14:45,786 --> 00:14:48,963
Oh and put in that stuff
where they write "L" and "8".

254
00:14:48,964 --> 00:14:51,018
That's how they say later.

255
00:14:54,562 --> 00:14:57,191
I never seen so many nerds in one place.

256
00:14:57,306 --> 00:14:59,775
Not since the last writers guild awards.

257
00:14:59,935 --> 00:15:03,435
This is Mulersfeild. We're going
to start with the wedgie scene.

258
00:15:03,852 --> 00:15:05,793
Maybe you did give me a wedgie,

259
00:15:06,122 --> 00:15:12,164
and sure my head is no stranger to the
raging waters of the third floor toilets.

260
00:15:12,663 --> 00:15:13,448
But one day...

261
00:15:13,783 --> 00:15:16,512
She be like ten,
fifteen years from now...

262
00:15:19,568 --> 00:15:23,542
Maybe you did give me a wedgie and...
Snap!

263
00:15:24,165 --> 00:15:27,040
and sure my head is no stranger
to the raging waters of the...

264
00:15:27,411 --> 00:15:28,893
of the third floor bathroom.

265
00:15:29,809 --> 00:15:32,278
(Both)
Thank you so much, that was great.

266
00:15:32,561 --> 00:15:35,668
I have to rewrite this scene.
I mean they can't all be this bad.

267
00:15:35,722 --> 00:15:37,281
What about that guy Chad?

268
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:40,598
Maybe if we called him
back with some notes?

269
00:15:40,624 --> 00:15:42,922
Let me just try one thing.

270
00:15:43,211 --> 00:15:45,765
- This is Adam.
- No wait. Give me a sec...

271
00:15:47,758 --> 00:15:49,055
How it did that?

272
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,610
We'll start with the wedgie scene.
It's on page six.

273
00:15:56,937 --> 00:15:58,495
I hope you're proud of your self.

274
00:15:59,136 --> 00:16:01,533
I hope you have a real
feeling of accomplishment.

275
00:16:01,624 --> 00:16:04,171
Because one day, and you know what
it might not be in high school.

276
00:16:04,188 --> 00:16:05,969
It might not even be the near future.

277
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:08,210
But one day you're going
to open a newspaper,

278
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:10,180
or you're going to
turn on the television,

279
00:16:10,952 --> 00:16:12,665
and you're going to see that I or...

280
00:16:13,451 --> 00:16:15,848
some other dungeon master
that you bullied,

281
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:18,264
has done something truly spectacular.

282
00:16:19,254 --> 00:16:20,369
And as you're putting on you're...

283
00:16:20,567 --> 00:16:22,713
name badge from Pretzel Time you'll say,

284
00:16:22,714 --> 00:16:25,459
"Wow, I really wish that
I was nice to that guy."

285
00:16:26,007 --> 00:16:27,424
Because you're laugh now.

286
00:16:27,843 --> 00:16:29,982
You say digital wedgies
are a way of the future.

287
00:16:29,983 --> 00:16:34,323
Well OK, I have one of those
wedgies right now, in my pants.

288
00:16:34,408 --> 00:16:38,591
But you, have a much
deeper darker wedgie...

289
00:16:39,309 --> 00:16:40,772
on you're soul.

290
00:16:41,553 --> 00:16:42,850
That's what I meant.

291
00:16:43,422 --> 00:16:45,594
- Very nice, we will be looking at you.
- That's OK?

292
00:16:45,684 --> 00:16:47,503
Thank you so much, that was great!

293
00:16:47,587 --> 00:16:49,612
- Adam that was great.
- Thank you very much we'll be in touch.

294
00:16:49,613 --> 00:16:51,011
Very good.
Thank you.

295
00:16:57,481 --> 00:16:59,317
There is some more to see tomorrow.

296
00:16:59,342 --> 00:17:01,941
Yeah, and his agent
to see if he's an asshole.

297
00:17:01,942 --> 00:17:02,642
Yeah.

298
00:17:15,713 --> 00:17:17,742
Don't even think about it.

299
00:17:21,511 --> 00:17:23,401
- Ready for the test?
- Yeah.

300
00:17:23,485 --> 00:17:25,122
You know what Dylan did yesterday?

301
00:17:25,337 --> 00:17:27,815
He took a tampon out of Gabby's backpack

302
00:17:27,816 --> 00:17:31,623
and stuck it in his mouth and
it go real big from his spit.

303
00:17:32,269 --> 00:17:34,669
I've been seriously underestimating him.

304
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,519
- Ya had to be there.
- Yeah.

305
00:17:36,567 --> 00:17:38,228
Back to math.
What is pi?

306
00:17:40,286 --> 00:17:41,941
- Three...
- Three...

307
00:17:42,189 --> 00:17:44,612
-Three point...
-Three point...

308
00:17:46,147 --> 00:17:49,186
Three point one four.
You knew it last night.

309
00:17:49,252 --> 00:17:51,860
Yeah.
OK. See ya.

310
00:17:52,151 --> 00:17:54,643
3.14 pi not forget!

311
00:17:55,691 --> 00:17:56,772
I was hilarious.

312
00:17:57,003 --> 00:17:58,983
But Brianna kept
telling me to be sexier,

313
00:17:58,984 --> 00:18:02,259
and she'd screw up her line if I didn't
do it that way but she knew it'd get cut.

314
00:18:03,014 --> 00:18:04,447
Yeah I get paid.
So what?

315
00:18:04,765 --> 00:18:05,916
It's not just the money Ma.

316
00:18:07,611 --> 00:18:08,313
I'll call you back.

317
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:10,663
Hi. Is Rosie here?

318
00:18:10,735 --> 00:18:12,134
She's getting her hair colored.

319
00:18:12,947 --> 00:18:14,352
She told me to pick up a schedule.

320
00:18:14,447 --> 00:18:15,246
Hold on.

321
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,746
Booya! Nothing but net!

322
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,057
Big boys know other ways to score.

323
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:43,967
- Taylor, where's Bree?
- Aren't we doing her wardrobe now?

324
00:18:44,021 --> 00:18:47,339
We're missing our lunch for her fitting,
and she's standing us up again.

325
00:18:47,533 --> 00:18:50,524
I'm sorry but I am not kissing
Brianna's ass any more.

326
00:18:50,946 --> 00:18:54,258
Speaking which, a little lipo would
help me with those shorter skirts.

327
00:18:54,293 --> 00:18:57,724
What are you nuts?
She's got a perfect body.

328
00:18:57,799 --> 00:18:59,983
Oh... Cottage cheese with your bagel?

329
00:19:00,201 --> 00:19:02,201
And when was the last time
we got a magazine cover?

330
00:19:02,211 --> 00:19:06,279
Lindsey, Paris, the girls of the
teen bath. That's all I'm saying.

331
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:08,278
Well you're nuts.
That's all I'm saying.

332
00:19:08,639 --> 00:19:09,371
Oh!

333
00:19:09,885 --> 00:19:12,933
Eh, well... Well you gotta remember
the attitude. Hum?

334
00:19:14,757 --> 00:19:17,896
No, no no no no. Let's not put
him in what the other guys like.

335
00:19:17,897 --> 00:19:20,129
It should be what he looks good in.

336
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:24,288
Find a shirt that brings out
the green in his eyes and um...

337
00:19:25,607 --> 00:19:28,292
Give the jacket and pants the
same color to make him thinner.

338
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:38,731
I don't like the way that sign light is.
Look at what it's doing to the skin.

339
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:47,953
What about the bags under his eyes.
He looks like he hasn't slept in a week.

340
00:19:51,949 --> 00:19:55,154
No no, we can't use this lens.
Nothing wider than a 40.

341
00:19:55,806 --> 00:19:57,735
Yeah, look at the nose.

342
00:20:11,183 --> 00:20:12,465
Oh my god.

343
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:14,858
Oh my god I'm beautiful.

344
00:20:16,294 --> 00:20:17,810
I am beautiful.

345
00:20:20,962 --> 00:20:23,248
Actually well I'm um...
You're really good.

346
00:20:23,295 --> 00:20:24,878
It wasn't that tough.

347
00:20:24,954 --> 00:20:28,114
Oh come on. I've never thought
of myself as good looking.

348
00:20:28,572 --> 00:20:29,334
Why not?

349
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:31,298
Girls never made me feel cute.

350
00:20:31,299 --> 00:20:33,611
I used to have to make them
laugh to get their attention.

351
00:20:33,991 --> 00:20:35,173
Wait a second.

352
00:20:36,014 --> 00:20:39,438
You used comedy as a cover
for feelings of inadequacy.

353
00:20:40,006 --> 00:20:41,689
You might be on to something there.

354
00:20:45,107 --> 00:20:45,860
Wait a minute.

355
00:20:46,687 --> 00:20:47,517
What?

356
00:20:48,357 --> 00:20:49,759
You're really beautiful.

357
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,415
All right now let's do you.

358
00:21:01,184 --> 00:21:02,961
Why is it that I have to get
painted and plucked

359
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:04,738
and you don't even have to
comb you're hair?

360
00:21:05,336 --> 00:21:06,640
How does one achieve this look?

361
00:21:06,981 --> 00:21:07,876
Egg-beater.

362
00:21:08,026 --> 00:21:11,066
Oh well... I'll see what I can do
but I can't work miracles.

363
00:21:11,639 --> 00:21:12,339
Rosie?

364
00:21:15,349 --> 00:21:16,295
Excuse me.

365
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:17,744
Adam, Brianna.

366
00:21:17,745 --> 00:21:20,019
- Adam is in next weeks episode.
- Yeah. Hi.

367
00:21:20,106 --> 00:21:20,806
Hi.

368
00:21:21,019 --> 00:21:21,995
I see you later.

369
00:21:22,532 --> 00:21:23,330
OK.

370
00:21:29,089 --> 00:21:31,093
You know Taylor said things about me.

371
00:21:32,088 --> 00:21:34,893
You know I can't arrive
at 7 a.m. for makeup,

372
00:21:34,894 --> 00:21:37,927
do a full day of work,
then go off to a wardrobe fitting,

373
00:21:37,928 --> 00:21:40,961
learn my lines, and still look 16.

374
00:21:41,252 --> 00:21:42,377
I just can't do it.

375
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:43,359
It's OK.

376
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:44,957
You know everyone want's a piece of me.

377
00:21:45,422 --> 00:21:47,270
There's just so much I can give.

378
00:21:47,287 --> 00:21:50,656
Bree, if you promise
to stop the yo-yo dieting,

379
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:53,668
we can make a mannequin and
you don't have to do the fittings.

380
00:21:53,684 --> 00:21:54,384
Thanks.

381
00:21:55,178 --> 00:21:59,032
I just know when I'm this tired
I can't do my best work.

382
00:21:59,047 --> 00:22:00,504
Well nobody wants that.

383
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:03,056
- Honey you're just tired.
- Yeah.

384
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:18,787
- Guess what?
- What?

385
00:22:18,788 --> 00:22:19,790
The life is good.

386
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,356
I know what you mean.

387
00:22:21,793 --> 00:22:24,204
Can I have "Lucky Charms"?
There magically delicious.

388
00:22:24,387 --> 00:22:27,048
Technically it's not really magic,
it's sugar.

389
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:29,819
You know what happened today?

390
00:22:29,892 --> 00:22:33,681
Me, Melanie and Zack are planning to
see the new Adam Sandler on Wednesday,

391
00:22:33,682 --> 00:22:36,126
and Zack ask Dylan to come
and he said OK.

392
00:22:36,195 --> 00:22:39,180
And then Zack said I'll be with Melanie
and you'll be with Izzie.

393
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:41,010
- And you know what Dylan said?
- What.

394
00:22:41,342 --> 00:22:44,901
- He said, "I guess".
- You're kidding.

395
00:22:45,775 --> 00:22:48,495
Izz, you still have shampoo.

396
00:22:48,702 --> 00:22:49,981
But this is "Suave"

397
00:22:49,982 --> 00:22:53,048
for the same luxurious hair as
"Panteen" at half the price.

398
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:54,824
When you put it like that.

399
00:22:55,387 --> 00:22:59,097
I can't believe you're going on a
group date with a boy you like.

400
00:22:59,164 --> 00:23:01,626
Oh don't worry Ma,
it's strictly platatonic.

401
00:23:07,644 --> 00:23:09,028
Hey, check it out.

402
00:23:09,737 --> 00:23:10,755
Shit's real.

403
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:15,064
- One of the SAT's dropping I think.
- Oh, OK.

404
00:23:15,417 --> 00:23:16,417
Yeah it will be better.

405
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:17,925
Scene twelve.
Taking one.

406
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:18,960
Ahhh!

407
00:23:20,905 --> 00:23:23,169
Who put this ketchup there?

408
00:23:24,229 --> 00:23:26,472
<i>- I got action Johnny.
- And action.</i>

409
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:35,092
<i>- Ready.
- Action.</i>

410
00:23:37,546 --> 00:23:39,776
I need to know what your
doing for the talent contest.

411
00:23:42,237 --> 00:23:45,836
- You like him.
- What are you talking about?

412
00:23:48,322 --> 00:23:49,655
- What are you doing?
- Brianna.

413
00:23:49,656 --> 00:23:52,390
Some kind of second city stuff?
I've already learned my lines.

414
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,471
I'll keep your cues exactly the same.

415
00:23:55,912 --> 00:23:58,073
I don't who's lines in any way.

416
00:23:58,074 --> 00:23:59,965
- Just great.
- Bree.

417
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:02,706
<i>Hey hey, drop off your phones.</i>

418
00:24:03,517 --> 00:24:07,023
I know you don't like thinking about
ratings but we're in deep shit.

419
00:24:07,024 --> 00:24:11,002
Now this guy could turn out
to be the next Ben Stiller.

420
00:24:11,795 --> 00:24:13,638
You never know.
And, you know...

421
00:24:13,639 --> 00:24:16,805
it wouldn't hurt for you to
have a good relationship with him.

422
00:24:24,182 --> 00:24:25,267
<i>OK we're back.</i>

423
00:24:26,433 --> 00:24:27,295
Thanks.

424
00:24:27,463 --> 00:24:29,380
So Monty said we're
work till like eight.

425
00:24:29,433 --> 00:24:31,924
Probably.
Yeah, I'm getting my tin coming back.

426
00:24:32,194 --> 00:24:34,681
Does your husband mind you uh...
working so late?

427
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:35,697
I'm not married.

428
00:24:35,854 --> 00:24:36,718
Ty your boyfriend?

429
00:24:37,144 --> 00:24:38,202
No. No boyfriend.

430
00:24:40,258 --> 00:24:42,200
So you have to pick out
music for the show right?

431
00:24:42,448 --> 00:24:44,775
Uh, me and the music supervisor.

432
00:24:44,815 --> 00:24:48,282
Cus this guy, who used to be my roommate,
is playing in a band on Friday night,

433
00:24:48,516 --> 00:24:51,614
and I figured since you have
to do that kind of thing anyway,

434
00:24:51,812 --> 00:24:54,860
- that maybe you'd uh...
- Can I uh... ask you something?

435
00:24:54,861 --> 00:24:55,561
Yeah.

436
00:24:56,583 --> 00:25:01,741
Well most of the students in the show
have wives and kids and homes and so...

437
00:25:01,742 --> 00:25:03,628
Well you know, they're
not exactly teenagers.

438
00:25:04,212 --> 00:25:08,339
And you have the job so it
doesn't matter. But how old are you?

439
00:25:08,587 --> 00:25:09,287
Really.

440
00:25:10,296 --> 00:25:10,996
Really?

441
00:25:11,372 --> 00:25:13,020
I'm like uh... 32.

442
00:25:13,654 --> 00:25:14,643
Why? How old are you?

443
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:18,676
- 37.
- You're a kid.

444
00:25:20,127 --> 00:25:21,151
So what do you say?

445
00:25:23,695 --> 00:25:24,395
Ok

446
00:25:24,546 --> 00:25:26,023
- Friday?
- All right.

447
00:25:26,089 --> 00:25:29,173
It's at Sullivans which is you know,
kind of a dive but,

448
00:25:29,272 --> 00:25:32,649
um, Lindsay stabbed um, Hillary there.
I think.

449
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:36,153
Or no Mary-Kate may uh...
happened... Ashley...

450
00:25:36,171 --> 00:25:38,895
- I don't know. It's kind of cool.
- It sounds lovely.

451
00:25:38,896 --> 00:25:40,955
Sullivans.
Yeah it's just above the palace.

452
00:25:41,135 --> 00:25:42,550
Oh yeah....

453
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:45,185
Oh yeah, you know where that is.

454
00:25:45,186 --> 00:25:46,472
But I can pick you up.

455
00:25:47,219 --> 00:25:48,914
- Great!
- Yeah? OK.

456
00:25:49,227 --> 00:25:49,940
At around 9:00?

457
00:25:49,941 --> 00:25:51,175
- All right.
- OK.

458
00:25:51,415 --> 00:25:52,481
Look where you're go!

459
00:25:53,076 --> 00:25:54,818
- Sorry.
- That's all right. I...

460
00:25:55,424 --> 00:25:57,483
Oh my God, how much do we love this?

461
00:25:57,484 --> 00:25:58,838
-Take it to my trailer.
- Thank you.

462
00:25:58,944 --> 00:25:59,666
I'll see ya!

463
00:26:00,552 --> 00:26:04,151
All right, so he's a little younger.
It would be fine if I was a man.

464
00:26:04,469 --> 00:26:08,896
Why can't you copy the smart things
men do and not the idiot things?

465
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,107
Izz!?

466
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,877
What did I tell you
about jumping on beds?

467
00:26:18,986 --> 00:26:21,933
- Only in hotels and Daddy's house.
-That's right. So...

468
00:26:22,301 --> 00:26:23,237
Tell be about school.

469
00:26:23,426 --> 00:26:25,335
Well me and Melanie had this idea today,

470
00:26:25,336 --> 00:26:28,807
that we'd ask Page to talk to Colin
since he's Dylan's best friend.

471
00:26:28,808 --> 00:26:31,425
And Colin would tell Dylan that I
like him and see what he says.

472
00:26:31,426 --> 00:26:33,006
No no no!
Don't let him know that you like him.

473
00:26:33,266 --> 00:26:35,215
Act like you don't know he's alive.

474
00:26:35,936 --> 00:26:40,369
Look busy all the time. You have to
behave like you couldn't care less.

475
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:44,594
Hello?

476
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:47,521
<i>Are you happy with
you're long distance service?</i>

477
00:26:49,811 --> 00:26:51,897
I'm learning allot about playing it cool.

478
00:27:11,682 --> 00:27:13,335
- What do you think?
- I like it.

479
00:27:13,435 --> 00:27:15,073
But look what happens when I do this.

480
00:27:16,632 --> 00:27:17,894
Then do not do that.

481
00:27:21,285 --> 00:27:23,982
- Oh, wow. A kid.
- Yes I am.

482
00:27:24,741 --> 00:27:25,888
You guys pretty cool right?

483
00:27:26,874 --> 00:27:28,237
Can I get you a beverage?

484
00:27:28,843 --> 00:27:29,548
Thank you.

485
00:27:30,887 --> 00:27:34,210
- Hey!
- That was a present. From Drew Carey.

486
00:27:34,211 --> 00:27:36,002
Oh, that's very thoughtful.

487
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,431
Ugh! yecka.

488
00:27:45,316 --> 00:27:48,277
Hey Zoloft.
Your Mom and I take the same medication.

489
00:27:48,554 --> 00:27:51,162
Sounds like a firm
basis for a relationship.

490
00:27:51,826 --> 00:27:54,533
I was in the middle of playing
"Apes Escape" if you'd care to join me.

491
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,654
Hey do you know the secret
to get to the next level?

492
00:27:57,418 --> 00:27:58,373
There's a secret?

493
00:27:59,134 --> 00:28:00,037
Can you show me?

494
00:28:05,262 --> 00:28:06,802
Oh all right.

495
00:28:15,998 --> 00:28:21,538
Izzie please! Shut those apes off.
I can't stand that stupid music.

496
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,512
Ma, I've reached new heights!

497
00:28:24,008 --> 00:28:24,708
Wow!

498
00:28:27,003 --> 00:28:27,703
Shit.

499
00:28:28,762 --> 00:28:29,632
Thanks.

500
00:28:43,116 --> 00:28:44,033
You look cold.

501
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:47,130
- Oh no, well be in side in just a....
- Here.

502
00:28:47,452 --> 00:28:48,152
OK.

503
00:28:50,249 --> 00:28:51,493
Can I see some ID?

504
00:29:06,267 --> 00:29:07,250
Excuse me.

505
00:29:11,596 --> 00:29:14,337
- Oh, you'll be the oldest one in there.
- I can deal.

506
00:29:14,417 --> 00:29:16,467
Wouldn't you rather be
at home in a nice hot bath

507
00:29:16,468 --> 00:29:18,649
reading an informative
article on Bolaws?

508
00:29:22,851 --> 00:29:24,956
Fine. You look ridiculous.

509
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:29,784
<i>They let her in?</i>

510
00:29:30,976 --> 00:29:33,534
<i>Yes my dear all your cloths are vintage.</i>

511
00:29:37,623 --> 00:29:39,759
<i>What is that cute guy dating his Mom?</i>

512
00:29:42,619 --> 00:29:44,030
- You want a drink?
- What?

513
00:29:44,086 --> 00:29:45,513
I'm going to get a beer.
You want something?

514
00:29:45,514 --> 00:29:46,514
Nothing.

515
00:29:53,581 --> 00:29:54,960
You look like you need a drink.

516
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,000
Oh, I do?

517
00:29:58,215 --> 00:30:00,945
Let me guess uh...
Apple martini right?

518
00:30:00,993 --> 00:30:02,854
I'm sorry I can't hear you.

519
00:30:06,072 --> 00:30:06,772
What's up?

520
00:30:15,032 --> 00:30:15,965
Want to dance?

521
00:30:17,204 --> 00:30:18,653
But no one else is.

522
00:30:19,054 --> 00:30:21,895
- Then we'll be the best one.
- I couldn't but don't let me stop you.

523
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,599
My turn to rock it.

524
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:39,902
You're nuts.

525
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:42,696
Hey it's Friday night.
I got to bring my "A" game.

526
00:31:47,581 --> 00:31:49,989
Quite a variety of steps you got there.

527
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:53,051
Well, two of everything I think.

528
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:55,413
I'm that good.

529
00:31:57,121 --> 00:31:58,748
- Oh I got to play you something.
- Oh Green Gang.

530
00:31:59,802 --> 00:32:00,994
Wrong mood.

531
00:32:01,489 --> 00:32:02,718
Ricky Martin?

532
00:32:03,467 --> 00:32:05,897
What?
That's not mine.

533
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:11,302
I'm not really 37.

534
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:14,677
- How old are you?
- 38.

535
00:32:15,132 --> 00:32:17,268
- I'm actually 31.
- OK.

536
00:32:20,544 --> 00:32:22,076
Uh... I need my keys.

537
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:33,661
I'm all right. I'm good. I got them.

538
00:32:47,838 --> 00:32:49,115
Oh, I need my wallet.

539
00:32:52,064 --> 00:32:54,051
- What are you doing?
- Huh?

540
00:32:54,407 --> 00:32:56,051
Consider this foreplay.

541
00:32:57,804 --> 00:33:01,109
- What a turn on.
- Yeah, I thought so.

542
00:33:08,841 --> 00:33:09,943
I'm 40.

543
00:33:11,086 --> 00:33:14,714
- 29.
- What happened to 30?

544
00:33:14,715 --> 00:33:17,161
- What happened to 39?
- You're not even in your 30's.

545
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:18,208
Well neither are you.

546
00:33:19,134 --> 00:33:22,546
Hey besides, you know that saying
"Never trust anyone over 30."

547
00:33:25,591 --> 00:33:26,633
So you can trust me.

548
00:33:38,965 --> 00:33:41,864
- Hey, you look great!
- Thanks.

549
00:33:41,993 --> 00:33:43,717
You had what done?
What'd you do?

550
00:33:44,249 --> 00:33:45,045
Nothing.

551
00:33:45,737 --> 00:33:46,808
Yeah, right.

552
00:33:51,334 --> 00:33:55,902
Watch this. He gets the money back.
He totally came up with that himself.

553
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:56,670
And look.

554
00:33:56,914 --> 00:33:58,085
Look at the testing.

555
00:33:58,313 --> 00:34:03,537
Boys ten to twelve 84%.
Girls 92%!

556
00:34:03,549 --> 00:34:06,727
We had the same numbers when
Screech was a substitute teacher.

557
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:09,815
But those were "Oh oh look, it's
that saved by the bell guy" numbers.

558
00:34:09,816 --> 00:34:10,516
-There's my ace.
-These are,

559
00:34:10,517 --> 00:34:13,847
who's the new guy?
Hey, I like him numbers.

560
00:34:13,958 --> 00:34:15,396
The rest of the scripts
are all approved.

561
00:34:15,397 --> 00:34:17,300
Why do you want to start
writing 3 new ones?

562
00:34:17,446 --> 00:34:20,274
Because this guys funny.
He's physical. He can act.

563
00:34:20,553 --> 00:34:21,771
Girls will love him.

564
00:34:22,598 --> 00:34:24,716
Oh at least one does.

565
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:26,959
I don't need the extra work.

566
00:34:27,653 --> 00:34:30,643
I believe this kid can spin off for you.

567
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:33,609
Ok, we drop one point it's your ass.

568
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:35,884
We won't.
I promise.

569
00:34:36,023 --> 00:34:37,543
<i>(Group)
Fight! Fight! Fight!</i>

570
00:34:40,058 --> 00:34:41,058
<i>(Group) Fight! Fight! Fight!
- Hey!</i>

571
00:34:41,736 --> 00:34:44,385
Hey! Cut it out!
Who told you to hit girls.

572
00:34:44,386 --> 00:34:46,526
- She started it.
- I can take him.

573
00:34:47,815 --> 00:34:49,036
What was that about?

574
00:34:49,221 --> 00:34:53,493
He said your Mother's show only got a
6.3 rating. And it's down the toilet.

575
00:34:54,857 --> 00:34:59,898
Hey Noah, I heard Brad Pit's
firing your dad's law firm.

576
00:35:02,896 --> 00:35:05,403
These guys are special
so they go on display.

577
00:35:06,418 --> 00:35:07,626
And these go to "Good Will".

578
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:09,340
- Oh, no.
- What's wrong?

579
00:35:09,438 --> 00:35:12,013
They're all naked and
skinny and lying in a pile.

580
00:35:12,014 --> 00:35:14,588
It looks like a concentration
camp. We have to dress them.

581
00:35:14,606 --> 00:35:17,244
- Ma...
- Please. It's depressing.

582
00:35:19,738 --> 00:35:21,284
What happened at the movies?

583
00:35:22,217 --> 00:35:23,834
Did Dilan put his arm around you?

584
00:35:24,631 --> 00:35:25,435
No

585
00:35:25,763 --> 00:35:29,597
Did you both put your arms
on the arm rest together?

586
00:35:30,075 --> 00:35:34,466
Well, first his arm went on it.
And then I put my arm on it.

587
00:35:34,467 --> 00:35:37,088
But then he took his off
and sat like this.

588
00:35:37,459 --> 00:35:39,065
He's not ready for girls yet.

589
00:35:39,123 --> 00:35:41,134
He had a girlfriend last year.

590
00:35:41,236 --> 00:35:42,487
Then he has no taste.

591
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:44,363
Ma I love him.

592
00:35:44,485 --> 00:35:46,584
Ok, I'm sorry.

593
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,352
Izz are you sure you're
done with these guys?

594
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,182
Yeah.

595
00:35:50,203 --> 00:35:51,329
It's just so sad.

596
00:35:51,368 --> 00:35:54,474
It's like when you finish a
season and the actors all go away.

597
00:35:56,044 --> 00:35:57,255
Want to play one last game?

598
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,237
Ma I'm too old for Barbies.

599
00:35:59,558 --> 00:36:00,816
Yeah, but I'm not.

600
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:05,405
Ok, who should be in love with who?

601
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:08,265
Let's see.

602
00:36:08,468 --> 00:36:10,076
- You're enabling.
- What?

603
00:36:10,482 --> 00:36:12,540
Wardrobe for the new scenes with Adam.

604
00:36:12,541 --> 00:36:15,581
I am not enabling.
This is rewriting. This is nice.

605
00:36:15,582 --> 00:36:16,282
Thank you.

606
00:36:16,283 --> 00:36:19,222
Putz, noun, a yokel a jerk.

607
00:36:19,223 --> 00:36:21,373
Our Rabbi consultant
said it means a penis.

608
00:36:21,473 --> 00:36:22,738
We're allowed to say penis.

609
00:36:22,823 --> 00:36:27,194
Yes you can say penis
but this is the bad penis. Like prick.

610
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:30,153
And what exactly is the good penis?

611
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:31,491
Check it out.

612
00:36:37,343 --> 00:36:39,137
Why don't I just say "He's so gay"?

613
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,523
That's kind of derogatory.

614
00:36:41,687 --> 00:36:42,600
But everyone says it.

615
00:36:43,463 --> 00:36:47,142
<i>- Ok everybody, that's lunch.
- Hey hey, drop off your phones.</i>

616
00:36:47,516 --> 00:36:49,720
No walking away with the props.

617
00:36:52,644 --> 00:36:53,472
I see you.

618
00:36:58,530 --> 00:36:59,749
He is an actor.

619
00:37:04,774 --> 00:37:07,109
Hey, back off Miss Bulimia.

620
00:37:10,616 --> 00:37:11,565
Hey Screech.

621
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:14,760
You know the buzz is
Brianna want's you out.

622
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:15,610
Why?

623
00:37:15,688 --> 00:37:16,882
She says you're too bry.

624
00:37:18,178 --> 00:37:18,878
Me?

625
00:37:20,723 --> 00:37:21,573
See I get you.

626
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:24,004
But Brianna, she doesn't like anyone

627
00:37:24,005 --> 00:37:26,900
unless they make a big old
stink about how gorgeous she is.

628
00:37:27,914 --> 00:37:31,021
Rosie really wishes you'd, you know,
flirt with her.

629
00:37:31,607 --> 00:37:32,596
She hasn't said anything.

630
00:37:32,776 --> 00:37:34,505
Well she can't exactly say
"Go hit on Brianna."

631
00:37:34,895 --> 00:37:37,541
Not after that stupid sexual
harassment class we had today.

632
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,608
Hey man, don't bogart all that doobage.

633
00:37:49,973 --> 00:37:51,302
It's not pot.

634
00:37:51,351 --> 00:37:53,666
- De je ton.
- Je ton!

635
00:37:53,744 --> 00:37:58,256
Oh je do de ton on.
Oh thank heavens for the little girls.

636
00:37:58,335 --> 00:38:02,413
(Babbling in fake French)

637
00:38:05,484 --> 00:38:08,538
...A white Zinfandel...
Hello.

638
00:38:08,923 --> 00:38:11,387
What is...
Wow how do you get that job?

639
00:38:11,887 --> 00:38:12,876
What's this?

640
00:38:13,737 --> 00:38:15,053
The way those two keep running off

641
00:38:15,054 --> 00:38:17,773
the AD's thought it'd be
easier to listen to where they are.

642
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:24,542
- Sounds like Adam likes Bree.
- This isn't very nice.

643
00:38:25,383 --> 00:38:29,454
I am so sick of reading about Meisha,
and Lindsey, and Katie.

644
00:38:29,455 --> 00:38:31,513
- Yeah.
- Now they're all getting better parts.

645
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:32,290
Yeah.

646
00:38:32,291 --> 00:38:35,712
Soon the whole yum girl faze is
going to be over. And it kills me.

647
00:38:35,912 --> 00:38:38,190
I mean I was a teenage girl
before any of them.

648
00:38:38,213 --> 00:38:39,135
- Bree,
- I should be playing...

649
00:38:39,136 --> 00:38:40,657
we're jumping ahead
to the beach party scene.

650
00:38:40,741 --> 00:38:42,905
Oh oh, I get to wear my pretty bikini.

651
00:38:47,884 --> 00:38:50,436
Did I ever tell you you have
the body of a 29 year old?

652
00:38:50,518 --> 00:38:51,804
Oh.
Really?

653
00:38:52,704 --> 00:38:54,837
I hope you plan to take advantage of it.

654
00:38:54,838 --> 00:38:55,725
I gotta go.

655
00:38:56,245 --> 00:38:57,639
I can't let you go.

656
00:38:58,241 --> 00:39:00,043
No, but I must.
You have to go. Go.

657
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:01,299
But I can't do it!

658
00:39:01,722 --> 00:39:02,664
But you have to go.

659
00:39:02,836 --> 00:39:06,649
You have to...
I can't go. But you must! All right.

660
00:39:06,714 --> 00:39:08,033
Your work is bigger than the both of us.

661
00:39:08,034 --> 00:39:10,797
After all the prom episode
isn't going to produce it self.

662
00:39:10,876 --> 00:39:11,753
I gotta go.

663
00:39:11,754 --> 00:39:13,369
- All right.
- We can continue this later.

664
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:14,785
- OK.
- You're done for today.

665
00:39:14,881 --> 00:39:16,857
Really?
My car's still in the shop.

666
00:39:17,057 --> 00:39:17,757
Take mine.

667
00:39:20,539 --> 00:39:22,163
I'll bring it back before you leave.

668
00:39:23,664 --> 00:39:24,366
OK.

669
00:39:25,714 --> 00:39:27,012
You go girl.

670
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:34,000
You're suspicious, you're giggle,
you're worried then you're mushie.

671
00:39:34,001 --> 00:39:36,120
What an emotional
roller coaster you're on.

672
00:39:36,188 --> 00:39:37,397
Roller coasters are fun.

673
00:39:37,495 --> 00:39:38,443
For teenagers.

674
00:39:38,444 --> 00:39:40,665
- Exhilarating.
- Until you get nauseous.

675
00:39:43,871 --> 00:39:44,817
Can I help you?

676
00:39:46,065 --> 00:39:50,069
- Just looking at the stage.
- Oh well, it's in use at the moment.

677
00:39:50,439 --> 00:39:52,036
Hum, OK.

678
00:39:56,558 --> 00:39:58,290
Go find out who they are.

679
00:39:58,941 --> 00:40:02,600
If A equals B. And B equals C plus ten.

680
00:40:02,882 --> 00:40:04,484
Then C is to A...

681
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:06,887
Ok if I had my first writing job on

682
00:40:06,888 --> 00:40:09,984
"Family Matters" in 1986
and he was born in...

683
00:40:11,181 --> 00:40:12,570
Oh by God!

684
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:18,147
1977!? Then Urkel is to him
what David Cassidy is to me.

685
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:21,786
And the dark myth Madonna is to me,
what the Jewish Madonna is to him.

686
00:40:21,787 --> 00:40:24,682
And if I mention something from
my childhood it would be to him how

687
00:40:24,683 --> 00:40:28,321
I feel about it as before I was born.
Like it's ancient history!

688
00:40:30,926 --> 00:40:32,497
- Ma?
-Huh?

689
00:40:32,666 --> 00:40:34,916
How do you make a
positive number turn negative?

690
00:40:35,752 --> 00:40:39,542
Take away it's Prozac and put it
with a bunch of smaller numbers.

691
00:40:45,152 --> 00:40:46,957
- Ow! Ow!
- Oh.

692
00:40:47,157 --> 00:40:48,789
Stop. stop.
Let me.

693
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:54,516
- This isn't going to work.
- Yeah I know.

694
00:40:54,517 --> 00:40:57,202
- Let's get in the back seat.
- No I mean this.

695
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,102
You and me.

696
00:41:02,442 --> 00:41:03,709
Wow, what'd I do?

697
00:41:03,765 --> 00:41:06,482
Oh no, nothing...
No you're...

698
00:41:07,794 --> 00:41:09,376
You're wonderful.

699
00:41:10,441 --> 00:41:14,051
- We had fun, Friday?
- Oh yeah. No Friday was great.

700
00:41:14,656 --> 00:41:15,356
Then why?

701
00:41:17,354 --> 00:41:21,015
I... Remember when we had
that talk about you being 29?

702
00:41:21,016 --> 00:41:22,695
I keep thinking about how...

703
00:41:24,125 --> 00:41:26,093
young...
that is.

704
00:41:27,137 --> 00:41:28,804
I'm planning on getting older.

705
00:41:28,821 --> 00:41:31,437
Yeah well,
I'm not planning on getting younger.

706
00:41:31,593 --> 00:41:32,787
That just means dumber.

707
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,060
Come on.

708
00:41:41,786 --> 00:41:44,161
You just think I'm a dumb kid.
Don't ya.

709
00:41:44,686 --> 00:41:47,467
No.
Of course not.

710
00:41:48,153 --> 00:41:52,249
You're the one who's young.
Young is far superior to old.

711
00:41:52,421 --> 00:41:53,121
In what?

712
00:41:53,364 --> 00:41:54,681
In everything.

713
00:41:55,185 --> 00:41:55,960
Oh yeah?

714
00:41:56,492 --> 00:41:59,468
Who's funnier, Tom
Green or George Carlin?

715
00:42:00,956 --> 00:42:02,943
Well that's a freak example.

716
00:42:03,341 --> 00:42:07,499
You know in our society
young outranks old.

717
00:42:07,544 --> 00:42:11,100
Tall outranks short.
Cute outranks smart.

718
00:42:12,373 --> 00:42:13,454
I just...

719
00:42:14,425 --> 00:42:16,273
If we got involved...

720
00:42:17,756 --> 00:42:20,127
someone's going to get hurt.
And...

721
00:42:21,579 --> 00:42:24,046
Because I'm older...

722
00:42:25,059 --> 00:42:27,093
I have to be the responsible one.

723
00:42:35,097 --> 00:42:36,988
But we could still be friends.

724
00:42:42,085 --> 00:42:46,199
- We can still be friends can't we?
- Yeah you know I was there for you.

725
00:42:49,065 --> 00:42:51,302
Matthew Perry has no sense of humor.

726
00:42:51,345 --> 00:42:52,243
Ok, this one.

727
00:42:59,352 --> 00:43:00,052
Hello

728
00:43:00,175 --> 00:43:01,531
(Together)
Ehhhhh.

729
00:43:02,218 --> 00:43:04,194
No it's much slower.

730
00:43:04,427 --> 00:43:05,427
Ehhhhh.

731
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:07,368
(Together)
Ehhhhh.

732
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:14,290
You are so grounded.

733
00:43:14,611 --> 00:43:17,026
<i>Hello!
I'm home!</i>

734
00:43:19,845 --> 00:43:20,931
What are you guys up to?

735
00:43:20,943 --> 00:43:21,705
Nothing.

736
00:43:22,218 --> 00:43:24,362
How come you're home so early?
Where's Adam?

737
00:43:24,655 --> 00:43:26,608
I decided we shouldn't go out anymore.

738
00:43:26,711 --> 00:43:27,895
Why? I like him.

739
00:43:29,243 --> 00:43:30,454
I'm trying to be mature.

740
00:43:30,715 --> 00:43:32,194
That's not really your style.

741
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,180
Yeah, I know.

742
00:43:34,287 --> 00:43:36,321
At what age do you
stop going out on dates?

743
00:43:36,975 --> 00:43:38,256
Don't be an idiot.

744
00:43:38,257 --> 00:43:40,360
What? Old people don't go out on dates.

745
00:43:40,795 --> 00:43:41,994
Good night.

746
00:43:42,708 --> 00:43:43,512
(Together)
Good night.

747
00:43:45,162 --> 00:43:46,973
- Quit it.
- I told her the truth.

748
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:54,247
Where's Rosie?

749
00:43:54,852 --> 00:43:56,131
She's at the gynecologist.

750
00:43:56,378 --> 00:43:58,198
- When's she going to be back?
- I don't know.

751
00:43:58,486 --> 00:44:00,490
They have to hack
through all the cobwebs.

752
00:44:02,191 --> 00:44:05,047
She told me to pick something
up at the office, but no one's there.

753
00:44:05,281 --> 00:44:05,981
Sure.

754
00:44:05,982 --> 00:44:09,642
That 45 year old would love to lock me
in the office while everone's on the set.

755
00:44:09,791 --> 00:44:12,715
And yet you manage to show up every day.
You're so brave.

756
00:44:13,048 --> 00:44:16,134
For you.
Rosie's decided to give you an "R".

757
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:17,260
What's an "R"?

758
00:44:17,864 --> 00:44:20,196
Its what you get when
you screw the producer.

759
00:44:21,772 --> 00:44:23,775
- She wrote these?
- Yeah.

760
00:44:23,776 --> 00:44:25,231
You got three more episodes.

761
00:44:27,133 --> 00:44:28,334
Since you're going to be around awhile,

762
00:44:28,716 --> 00:44:31,024
why don't you and I, you know,
get some coffee?

763
00:44:33,734 --> 00:44:35,869
So what are you saying
we can't use the "Sparkly Farbs"?

764
00:44:35,941 --> 00:44:36,641
No

765
00:44:37,376 --> 00:44:38,922
They can be prom phones.

766
00:44:39,914 --> 00:44:42,095
- Hey!
- Hi.

767
00:44:42,678 --> 00:44:45,129
Oh, I see you got the new episodes.

768
00:44:45,218 --> 00:44:47,335
Yep, and ah...

769
00:44:47,405 --> 00:44:49,255
- I got some good news for you.
- You do?

770
00:44:49,674 --> 00:44:52,347
I've been doing allot of soul
searching lately and...

771
00:44:54,398 --> 00:44:55,907
I'm gonna to give you
another shot with me.

772
00:44:58,055 --> 00:45:00,103
Pretty sly Stallone.

773
00:45:00,185 --> 00:45:01,792
I think you're good for the show.

774
00:45:02,127 --> 00:45:04,112
You think that's what
you think but really

775
00:45:04,113 --> 00:45:06,836
your subconscious is finding
ways to keep you with me.

776
00:45:06,907 --> 00:45:10,839
I'm surprised some ivy league psyche
department hasn't snatched you up.

777
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:13,686
Art with out love is nothing.
Niche said that.

778
00:45:13,687 --> 00:45:14,387
Oh.

779
00:45:14,662 --> 00:45:16,722
I don't think Niche watch "You Go Girl".

780
00:45:18,321 --> 00:45:19,450
He could have TiVoed it.

781
00:45:21,789 --> 00:45:22,489
Could of.

782
00:45:25,922 --> 00:45:27,116
(Indistinct)

783
00:46:34,888 --> 00:46:35,888
(Oinking)

784
00:46:47,037 --> 00:46:48,876
Adam likes you allot.

785
00:46:48,985 --> 00:46:50,696
Yeah, why do you think that?

786
00:46:50,966 --> 00:46:53,257
He make you a music mix.

787
00:46:54,233 --> 00:46:56,411
That's how boys tell
you what's in their heart.

788
00:46:56,627 --> 00:46:58,720
That is so adolescent.

789
00:46:58,927 --> 00:47:00,101
Just listen to it.

790
00:47:19,376 --> 00:47:20,135
Hey

791
00:47:21,398 --> 00:47:23,087
- Uh?
- Where this your car?

792
00:47:23,782 --> 00:47:26,477
Ah it's at another party I'm going to.

793
00:47:28,086 --> 00:47:32,123
You know that, uh, Rosie wanted to cut
your scene but I told her to keep it in.

794
00:47:32,387 --> 00:47:33,087
Thanks.

795
00:47:34,164 --> 00:47:35,572
Hey we're here!

796
00:47:39,799 --> 00:47:42,311
See.
Don't we look alike.

797
00:47:43,374 --> 00:47:45,827
- I don't see it.
- No I can. They look a little alike.

798
00:47:45,884 --> 00:47:47,300
Yeah, you can totally be his nephew.

799
00:47:47,301 --> 00:47:48,756
Nephew?
You mean brother.

800
00:47:49,064 --> 00:47:50,942
- How old are you?
- 30.

801
00:47:51,122 --> 00:47:52,302
Well how old do you think I am?

802
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,170
49?

803
00:47:54,761 --> 00:47:57,073
Yes. But how old do I look.

804
00:47:57,195 --> 00:48:00,763
- Well I'd say...
- Say 32 or he'll never stop.

805
00:48:02,831 --> 00:48:04,998
- 32?
- Thank you.

806
00:48:06,117 --> 00:48:08,556
- Moisturizer.
- (All) Ohhhh.

807
00:48:15,197 --> 00:48:19,073
No!
This stuff is impossible to clean up.

808
00:48:19,074 --> 00:48:21,162
Izzie what did I say
about jumping on beds.

809
00:48:23,042 --> 00:48:24,251
Please don't Ma.

810
00:48:24,252 --> 00:48:27,565
It took us all this time to talk Dylan
into playing truth or dare

811
00:48:27,566 --> 00:48:30,208
and then he started showing off.
And I was afraid you'd stop him.

812
00:48:30,209 --> 00:48:31,843
He was doing this to make you laugh?

813
00:48:31,844 --> 00:48:33,996
- I think.
- Pretty good yes?

814
00:48:33,997 --> 00:48:36,085
- Is Brianna Minx here?
- Not yet.

815
00:48:36,207 --> 00:48:37,344
But she's coming?

816
00:48:37,422 --> 00:48:39,178
- Uh, probably.
- Come on.

817
00:48:42,309 --> 00:48:43,293
Men.

818
00:48:45,608 --> 00:48:49,576
<i>Hey, don't go away.
And all new "You Go Girl" is up next.</i>

819
00:48:55,723 --> 00:48:57,732
Quite everybody,
here come my big scene.

820
00:48:57,805 --> 00:49:00,354
Mr. Heart, can I have a bathroom pass?

821
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,790
Wow, who found that skateboard?

822
00:49:06,843 --> 00:49:08,729
Yeah yeah yeah,
props to props.

823
00:49:09,262 --> 00:49:09,966
<i>Good job.</i>

824
00:49:11,247 --> 00:49:12,138
<i>Here's to you.</i>

825
00:49:29,271 --> 00:49:30,907
- Nathan.
- Huh?

826
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,170
Put it down.

827
00:49:33,443 --> 00:49:35,977
Fine.
I bought it.

828
00:49:36,369 --> 00:49:37,262
You didn't buy it.

829
00:50:39,639 --> 00:50:40,489
See you later Adam.

830
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:42,504
Hey take it easy Terry.
Good job tonight.

831
00:50:43,568 --> 00:50:44,728
Ready to leaving?

832
00:50:45,115 --> 00:50:46,923
- Uh, are you?
- Sure.

833
00:50:47,887 --> 00:50:48,887
See you later.

834
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:51,715
Well I was giving you a ride home.

835
00:50:51,716 --> 00:50:54,288
Oh that's alright I already have on.
Excuse me just for a second.

836
00:50:57,218 --> 00:50:58,063
Leg rubber.

837
00:51:00,005 --> 00:51:01,492
The cloths on the show look great.

838
00:51:01,617 --> 00:51:02,617
What are you working on at the moment?

839
00:51:03,102 --> 00:51:06,529
Well, I'm writing that
reality show called "Assisted Living".

840
00:51:07,008 --> 00:51:08,528
Takes place in an old age home.

841
00:51:08,978 --> 00:51:11,048
How can it be real if you're write it?

842
00:51:11,366 --> 00:51:12,279
Isn't she cute.

843
00:51:13,633 --> 00:51:15,487
- Cracking show.
- Good night.

844
00:51:16,664 --> 00:51:17,364
Thanks Rosie.

845
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:19,184
- Thanks to come.
- Good night.

846
00:51:19,397 --> 00:51:21,194
Bree, excellent episode.

847
00:51:22,167 --> 00:51:23,798
- I'm concerned?
- Why?

848
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:27,232
I think Adam's broad humor
cheapens your wonderful writing.

849
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:29,390
Thinks about it.

850
00:51:30,805 --> 00:51:33,347
Good night.
Nice meeting you uh...

851
00:51:33,928 --> 00:51:35,794
- bat boy.
- Joey.

852
00:51:36,795 --> 00:51:40,786
- Now take this off.
- No I feel naked.

853
00:51:40,852 --> 00:51:42,869
Show some skin.
He's just in there.

854
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:45,950
- My bra straps are showing.
- Don't show 'em to me show them to him.

855
00:51:45,951 --> 00:51:46,651
Good luck.

856
00:51:50,884 --> 00:51:51,646
Here Ma.

857
00:51:53,507 --> 00:51:54,735
<i>I have receipts.</i>

858
00:52:00,254 --> 00:52:02,490
- Is Jeannie gone?
- Everyone's gone.

859
00:52:04,164 --> 00:52:05,957
You know what's so cool.
I talked to my grandmother,

860
00:52:05,958 --> 00:52:08,647
she invited over all of her neighbors,
she's like the fit of the condo.

861
00:52:11,547 --> 00:52:12,650
You want something to drink?

862
00:52:13,477 --> 00:52:14,177
Beer.

863
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:21,722
It's weird you know,
it's like one minute you're watching

864
00:52:21,823 --> 00:52:24,050
Jarred lose weight eating subways

865
00:52:25,030 --> 00:52:27,063
and then it's you.
I don't know.

866
00:52:27,198 --> 00:52:28,960
Yeah.
Pretty heavy stuff.

867
00:52:35,919 --> 00:52:38,777
- I don't want to wake up Izzie.
- She's not here. She's with her father.

868
00:52:40,081 --> 00:52:41,062
When's she coming back?

869
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:43,051
Sunday.

870
00:52:43,779 --> 00:52:44,990
So we're all alone then?

871
00:52:46,013 --> 00:52:46,713
Yep.

872
00:52:48,992 --> 00:52:50,116
Just you and me.

873
00:52:53,202 --> 00:52:55,536
Mrs. Robinson you're
trying to seduce to me.

874
00:52:56,041 --> 00:52:57,836
You would like me to seduce you?

875
00:52:58,006 --> 00:52:58,706
Yes!

876
00:53:16,198 --> 00:53:17,495
I've missed you.

877
00:53:18,254 --> 00:53:19,484
I've missed you too.

878
00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:31,722
You are so dead.

879
00:54:02,034 --> 00:54:05,003
Nice. Lovely. Frame.
Get up get up get up.

880
00:54:05,534 --> 00:54:07,629
Oh yes, yes.
Uh.

881
00:54:14,779 --> 00:54:16,635
Yes! Yes! Yes!

882
00:54:17,037 --> 00:54:18,981
(Phone rings)
Don't answer that.

883
00:54:18,982 --> 00:54:19,846
That's my Mom.

884
00:54:20,398 --> 00:54:21,765
I'm sorry
Hey Mom.

885
00:54:21,766 --> 00:54:23,873
<i>- Guess what your father did?
- Yeah, look can I call you back?</i>

886
00:54:55,871 --> 00:54:58,679
Oh shit, I left my condoms in the car.

887
00:54:58,898 --> 00:54:59,694
Wait here.

888
00:55:03,587 --> 00:55:07,956
You know, one day frat boy here is going
to want to get somebody pregnant.

889
00:55:08,478 --> 00:55:09,178
So?

890
00:55:09,274 --> 00:55:10,932
So by the time he's ready

891
00:55:11,287 --> 00:55:14,273
you're going to be as brittle
as those rice cakes you live on.

892
00:55:14,438 --> 00:55:16,484
There's more to love than having babies.

893
00:55:16,634 --> 00:55:19,755
- He's just using you.
- That is so wrong.

894
00:55:20,470 --> 00:55:22,096
He already has the job.

895
00:55:22,126 --> 00:55:23,817
Let me in, I forgot my keys.

896
00:55:24,945 --> 00:55:27,259
You'd loose your head
if it wasn't attached.

897
00:55:43,444 --> 00:55:45,099
Give this to Adam would you?

898
00:55:45,410 --> 00:55:46,110
That's this?

899
00:55:46,342 --> 00:55:48,225
We collected his real phone by accident.

900
00:55:49,224 --> 00:55:50,532
- Tell him I'm sorry.
- Ok, sure.

901
00:56:13,735 --> 00:56:15,846
Well we got a 7.2 rating.

902
00:56:15,847 --> 00:56:17,958
Yeah but "David Spade"
got twice as much.

903
00:56:18,251 --> 00:56:20,669
Yes.
But you have to look at the lead in.

904
00:56:20,681 --> 00:56:23,464
See, even though
their numbers look higher

905
00:56:23,465 --> 00:56:25,800
we went up from "Candy Strippers".
So...

906
00:56:26,871 --> 00:56:28,430
You understand how TV works now?

907
00:56:28,431 --> 00:56:30,637
Yeah yeah yeah.
Everyone love "David Spade".

908
00:56:31,211 --> 00:56:35,237
Would you forget about "David Spade"?
Anyway we went up 2 points.

909
00:56:35,398 --> 00:56:37,406
They have to be happy about that.

910
00:56:37,992 --> 00:56:39,438
What do you love most about me?

911
00:56:41,488 --> 00:56:42,917
Who said I love you?

912
00:56:43,219 --> 00:56:44,188
Oh come on.

913
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,106
I'm not saying that.

914
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:47,895
First.

915
00:56:48,889 --> 00:56:51,028
<i>- What if we tell...
- Oh by God.</i>

916
00:56:51,036 --> 00:56:52,503
<i>Weren't you on "You Go Girl" this week?</i>

917
00:56:52,651 --> 00:56:53,948
You were so funny.

918
00:56:55,008 --> 00:56:58,263
Oh that scene where they
teach you to dance was so funny.

919
00:56:58,264 --> 00:56:58,964
Thank you.

920
00:56:59,307 --> 00:57:01,001
I mean,
I don't usually watch "You Go Girl".

921
00:57:01,002 --> 00:57:03,565
- It's gone so down hill.
- Oh I don't know about that.

922
00:57:03,883 --> 00:57:06,463
But that episode,
was the best in months.

923
00:57:06,479 --> 00:57:07,823
<i>Is that the check?</i>

924
00:57:08,186 --> 00:57:09,246
I can give this you?

925
00:57:09,803 --> 00:57:10,503
Yeah, sure.

926
00:57:12,232 --> 00:57:13,566
She was great.

927
00:57:14,827 --> 00:57:17,605
Did you know Marty Green?
He's president of comedy development.

928
00:57:17,606 --> 00:57:18,359
Yeah I know him.

929
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:20,674
He wants me to go with him
to the network on Friday.

930
00:57:21,083 --> 00:57:22,494
A new show or...

931
00:57:22,548 --> 00:57:23,248
I don't now.

932
00:57:24,637 --> 00:57:26,735
It was so great meeting you.

933
00:57:27,027 --> 00:57:30,635
I hope you don't think this is too pushy
but I'd love to give you my head shot.

934
00:57:31,757 --> 00:57:33,218
Uh, also I have a reel.

935
00:57:33,528 --> 00:57:37,000
And I'm studying the Misner method
with Jeff Goldblum.

936
00:57:38,259 --> 00:57:40,417
Maybe if you can give it
to the "You Go Girl" people.

937
00:57:43,202 --> 00:57:45,199
Well I put my number there.
Look.

938
00:57:46,132 --> 00:57:46,832
Thanks.

939
00:57:50,015 --> 00:57:53,618
He's had a little taste of fame and now
it's time to see what it can get him.

940
00:57:54,356 --> 00:57:55,825
He's not interested.

941
00:57:56,896 --> 00:57:58,653
Let me show you something.

942
00:58:01,214 --> 00:58:04,215
Notice the large hip to waist ratio.

943
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:05,365
That's not his type.

944
00:58:05,477 --> 00:58:08,687
Fertility is everyone's type
wether they realize it or not.

945
00:58:08,796 --> 00:58:11,862
This butt is screaming estrogen.

946
00:58:12,174 --> 00:58:14,834
Not to mention her odor
and excess body hair.

947
00:58:15,115 --> 00:58:18,556
Now she can starve it, she can wax it,
she can deodorize it,

948
00:58:18,557 --> 00:58:20,707
but he will pick up the signals.

949
00:58:20,708 --> 00:58:24,529
Signals your body isn't sending.
No matter how well you preserve it.

950
00:58:24,619 --> 00:58:26,857
That's how it is for animals, not us.

951
00:58:27,890 --> 00:58:29,160
Your hopeless!

952
00:58:29,653 --> 00:58:30,870
Are these any good?

953
00:58:32,054 --> 00:58:33,521
Well the coffee came really fast.

954
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:39,630
If you send $140.00

955
00:58:39,631 --> 00:58:42,503
how much is the flower per pound.
I don't know.

956
00:58:42,751 --> 00:58:44,247
You didn't even try.

957
00:58:44,447 --> 00:58:47,033
I mean, even if I get it right
Mr. Skinner says

958
00:58:47,034 --> 00:58:50,023
that I didn't figure it out
the right way. I hate math.

959
00:58:50,024 --> 00:58:51,855
If you eat 3 cookies

960
00:58:52,012 --> 00:58:56,027
and 50 calorie plum
and you had 140 calories

961
00:58:56,337 --> 00:58:57,975
- how many in one cookie?
- 30.

962
00:58:58,290 --> 00:58:59,138
Right.

963
00:58:59,795 --> 00:59:01,344
So why do they make it so hard?

964
00:59:02,408 --> 00:59:04,873
Did Adam call?
Because I think that he's coming over.

965
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:05,874
(Phone ringing)

966
00:59:05,954 --> 00:59:07,202
Ma your purse is ringing.

967
00:59:09,645 --> 00:59:10,954
Oh that's Adam's phone.

968
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:13,010
Hotshemama!

969
00:59:13,202 --> 00:59:14,851
Is that the new "You Go Girl" poster?

970
00:59:17,212 --> 00:59:21,086
No, that's Brianna
in a bedroom with someone.

971
00:59:21,787 --> 00:59:24,431
Well I'm not going to help you pack,
so don't go there.

972
00:59:24,678 --> 00:59:26,309
Someone just sent it to him.

973
00:59:26,362 --> 00:59:29,246
If this was sent to the phone
wouldn't it be in a...

974
00:59:29,624 --> 00:59:33,200
message place? I mean, how did it get
to be there when you turn it on?

975
00:59:33,353 --> 00:59:35,895
How did TiVo know
that you like "South Park"?

976
00:59:36,132 --> 00:59:39,045
How did they get "Baby's Got Back"
to be a ring tone.

977
00:59:39,385 --> 00:59:41,936
I won't jump to any conclusions.
I'll talk to him about it.

978
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:43,337
<i>Honey!?</i>

979
00:59:44,148 --> 00:59:46,290
I'm home.

980
00:59:46,449 --> 00:59:47,477
Alone.

981
00:59:49,609 --> 00:59:51,252
Starring Macaulay Culkin

982
00:59:51,374 --> 00:59:53,607
as a boy who was inadvertently left

983
00:59:53,883 --> 00:59:54,626
by him self

984
00:59:55,751 --> 00:59:56,885
at his house

985
00:59:57,488 --> 01:00:00,539
when his parents go on vacat...
What are you making.

986
01:00:03,478 --> 01:00:05,975
My phone.
I've been looking for...

987
01:00:07,227 --> 01:00:08,419
When'd you did this?

988
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:13,321
You are right he isn't cheating!

989
01:00:13,397 --> 01:00:14,303
How'd you tell?

990
01:00:14,403 --> 01:00:15,832
He's not that good an actor.

991
01:00:20,172 --> 01:00:20,872
<i>Guys!</i>

992
01:00:24,817 --> 01:00:26,614
Guys, can we finish this?

993
01:00:26,615 --> 01:00:27,615
What for?

994
01:00:27,888 --> 01:00:29,627
So we can make the show better.

995
01:00:29,628 --> 01:00:31,035
<i>The writing's on the wall.</i>

996
01:00:31,455 --> 01:00:33,480
Come on, for the shorties.

997
01:00:33,481 --> 01:00:38,057
OK, Trays band is blowing up and Yomena
feels unappreciated and she says...

998
01:00:39,058 --> 01:00:41,518
- Where's Rosencrantz and O'Reilly?
- Mail.

999
01:00:41,779 --> 01:00:43,369
They had a meeting with Marty.

1000
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:45,475
And they were wearing jackets.

1001
01:00:46,281 --> 01:00:47,733
A network meeting?

1002
01:00:51,869 --> 01:00:52,596
Oh look!

1003
01:00:52,898 --> 01:00:55,361
I never got one of those
picture tickets befo...

1004
01:01:00,588 --> 01:01:03,141
- It's so great your doing that.
- Anything for the kids.

1005
01:01:03,142 --> 01:01:05,398
Hey have you and Adam
been seeing each other?

1006
01:01:05,921 --> 01:01:06,621
No

1007
01:01:06,855 --> 01:01:08,060
Is this what you're wearing?

1008
01:01:08,336 --> 01:01:09,592
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Great.

1009
01:01:09,692 --> 01:01:13,044
Not even just friendly,
going places, driving around.

1010
01:01:13,251 --> 01:01:13,951
Rosie.

1011
01:01:13,952 --> 01:01:15,256
<i>Hey, she's here.</i>

1012
01:01:15,407 --> 01:01:16,107
You sure?

1013
01:01:16,809 --> 01:01:19,263
I may be a lot of things
but I'm not a liar.

1014
01:01:19,264 --> 01:01:21,698
- Hey thank you so much for doing this.
- Sure.

1015
01:01:24,996 --> 01:01:26,554
- TSA taking one.
- Action.

1016
01:01:26,992 --> 01:01:30,147
I would never ever date a smoker.

1017
01:01:30,828 --> 01:01:32,727
- Cut.
- Great check it.

1018
01:01:36,667 --> 01:01:37,643
Be with you in a minute.

1019
01:01:37,644 --> 01:01:39,695
<i>- Cortney Love?
- Drop out Hag.</i>

1020
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:40,396
<i>Fay Dunaway?</i>

1021
01:01:40,397 --> 01:01:42,092
- Don't call us we'll call you.
- Sharon Stone?

1022
01:01:42,093 --> 01:01:42,793
Hag.

1023
01:01:42,794 --> 01:01:43,794
- Gena Davis?
- Hag.

1024
01:01:43,795 --> 01:01:45,084
- Sigourney Weaver?
- Hag.

1025
01:01:45,085 --> 01:01:46,177
- Kim Basinger?
- Hag.

1026
01:01:46,178 --> 01:01:47,610
- Emma Thompson?
- Britt hag.

1027
01:01:47,716 --> 01:01:50,446
- Susan Sarandon?
- Richly alienated hag.

1028
01:01:50,447 --> 01:01:51,290
Meg Ryan?

1029
01:01:51,909 --> 01:01:53,048
Too much plastic surgery.

1030
01:01:53,049 --> 01:01:54,089
Melanie Griffith?

1031
01:01:54,090 --> 01:01:55,561
Way too much plastic surgery.

1032
01:01:55,562 --> 01:01:57,842
- Patricia Heaton?
- Pointless plastic surgery.

1033
01:01:58,166 --> 01:01:58,866
Cher.

1034
01:01:59,372 --> 01:02:01,691
Insurmountable amount
of plastic surgery.

1035
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:06,524
Listen you little bird of a man where
do you come off insulting these women?

1036
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:09,800
How many good songs did you sing?
How many Oscars do you have?

1037
01:02:09,889 --> 01:02:11,709
Could you look cute
next to Warren Beatty,

1038
01:02:11,710 --> 01:02:13,778
or live with Don Johnson,
or act with Ted Dansen?

1039
01:02:13,904 --> 01:02:16,535
You're not worthy of
kissing Cher's tattooed ass.

1040
01:02:16,821 --> 01:02:17,942
He'll see ya now.

1041
01:02:20,725 --> 01:02:21,976
Hey you look great.

1042
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:24,657
How's Lizzie?

1043
01:02:25,405 --> 01:02:27,852
You're asking me about my kid
something must be wrong.

1044
01:02:28,171 --> 01:02:29,704
OK, I won't BS ya.

1045
01:02:30,428 --> 01:02:33,229
There's fewer and fewer
spots for scripted show.

1046
01:02:33,230 --> 01:02:36,031
They're expensive dinosaurs.
No one cares.

1047
01:02:36,042 --> 01:02:37,427
"Two And A Half Men"?

1048
01:02:37,493 --> 01:02:39,442
Older woman, the least desirable demo.

1049
01:02:39,443 --> 01:02:42,955
If we want the kids we gotta
be cutting edge and off the chain.

1050
01:02:43,049 --> 01:02:44,890
That means music and cloths.

1051
01:02:45,213 --> 01:02:46,926
You keep lowering our budget.

1052
01:02:46,990 --> 01:02:49,012
Face it "You Go Girl" is...

1053
01:02:49,848 --> 01:02:50,762
straight played.

1054
01:02:50,947 --> 01:02:53,463
I'd rather tell you now
since we're friends then...

1055
01:02:54,137 --> 01:02:56,652
So you're replacing me
with a reality show.

1056
01:02:57,579 --> 01:02:59,672
Actually we got a sitcom for that slot.

1057
01:03:00,060 --> 01:03:02,472
Two hip young writers,
Rosencrantz and O'Reilly,

1058
01:03:02,473 --> 01:03:05,535
have created a show for
this hip new funny kid uh...

1059
01:03:05,536 --> 01:03:07,884
Oh wait you know him,
Adam Pearl.

1060
01:03:09,179 --> 01:03:10,982
It's called "The Shizzle".

1061
01:03:11,997 --> 01:03:12,895
"The Shizzle"?

1062
01:03:13,393 --> 01:03:17,100
"The Shizzle".
It mean the new cool stuff.

1063
01:03:17,170 --> 01:03:19,442
No, it doesn't,
it means shit!

1064
01:03:19,775 --> 01:03:23,207
I can't say anything and you
can name a show after shit!

1065
01:03:23,537 --> 01:03:24,857
How do you like that?

1066
01:03:25,671 --> 01:03:27,456
Good luck.
I'm sure it'll live up to it's name.

1067
01:03:27,806 --> 01:03:28,947
Thanks for your support.

1068
01:03:34,988 --> 01:03:35,770
Rosie!

1069
01:03:35,998 --> 01:03:38,193
Hey Henry!
ehhhh.

1070
01:03:38,492 --> 01:03:40,102
See? You should have been Pinkey.

1071
01:03:40,196 --> 01:03:42,858
Congratulations on your show.
It's really funny.

1072
01:03:42,859 --> 01:03:44,794
- Thank you. We're having a great time.
- My kid loves it too.

1073
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:46,667
Oh yeah, talking about your kid...

1074
01:03:46,672 --> 01:03:49,954
I think she got hold of your phone book.
I got some crank calls.

1075
01:03:50,177 --> 01:03:51,248
- You know.
- What?

1076
01:03:51,249 --> 01:03:53,301
Yeah and, now listen, I don't mind.

1077
01:03:53,302 --> 01:03:55,564
But if she calls an executive
with no sense of humor.

1078
01:03:55,565 --> 01:03:58,914
Oh my god. I am so sorry.
No no no no it won't happen again.

1079
01:03:58,915 --> 01:04:01,679
Believe me I understand. My kids still
do it and their in their 20's.

1080
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:03,330
- I'm glad to see ya.
- You too.

1081
01:04:04,103 --> 01:04:05,669
- You look great.
- Thanks.

1082
01:04:08,769 --> 01:04:11,004
(Both) - I'm sorry.
- I can't believe you did such a thing.

1083
01:04:11,468 --> 01:04:12,624
What were you thinking?

1084
01:04:13,079 --> 01:04:13,779
Nothing.

1085
01:04:13,780 --> 01:04:16,739
Was it just Henry Winkler?
Who else did you call?

1086
01:04:16,789 --> 01:04:18,069
- Jerry Stiller.
- No one.

1087
01:04:18,860 --> 01:04:19,849
Who else?

1088
01:04:20,077 --> 01:04:25,027
Andy Dick, Justine Bateman,
Kirstie Alley, Heather Graham.

1089
01:04:25,028 --> 01:04:26,516
- David Hyde Pierce
- Uhhuh.

1090
01:04:28,014 --> 01:04:29,302
- Johnny Knoxville
- Right.

1091
01:04:29,391 --> 01:04:31,503
Mel, I think you should go home now.

1092
01:04:31,835 --> 01:04:32,535
I'm sorry.

1093
01:04:36,879 --> 01:04:39,520
This makes me look like such an idiot.

1094
01:04:40,178 --> 01:04:41,732
If you have someones home number

1095
01:04:41,733 --> 01:04:44,834
it's because they trust you
to protect their privacy.

1096
01:04:45,421 --> 01:04:47,575
Now I look totally unprofessional.

1097
01:04:47,631 --> 01:04:48,331
I'm sorry.

1098
01:04:48,628 --> 01:04:49,771
What am I going to do with you?

1099
01:04:50,475 --> 01:04:51,932
You could punish to me.

1100
01:04:51,954 --> 01:04:54,878
Like I could write an
apology to everyone I called

1101
01:04:54,879 --> 01:04:56,554
and not use the phone for a week.

1102
01:04:58,311 --> 01:04:59,278
A month.

1103
01:05:00,130 --> 01:05:02,600
That's excessive.
Two weeks.

1104
01:05:02,972 --> 01:05:03,694
OK.

1105
01:05:04,494 --> 01:05:08,772
What's going on all of a sudden?
Everyone I take care of is turning on me.

1106
01:05:09,512 --> 01:05:12,501
Mom, you're globalizing.

1107
01:05:44,210 --> 01:05:48,409
<i>(Both) Weird subjects in this night,
forces of love's pure light.</i>

1108
01:05:48,882 --> 01:05:51,213
Why is it so dark in here?
What...

1109
01:05:51,436 --> 01:05:53,269
What are you guys doing?

1110
01:05:53,575 --> 01:05:55,710
- Putting a spell on Dylan.
- We're witches.

1111
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:56,836
That's so sad.

1112
01:05:57,148 --> 01:06:02,002
Don't worry Ma, we're not Satan
worshiping human sacrificing witches.

1113
01:06:02,003 --> 01:06:04,635
- We're black mini-skirt witches.
- Like in "The Craft".

1114
01:06:04,648 --> 01:06:06,832
It's just lousy that
the only way teenage girls

1115
01:06:06,833 --> 01:06:10,823
can feel in control is
to be anorexic or witches.

1116
01:06:11,919 --> 01:06:13,392
How do you do this anyway?

1117
01:06:13,732 --> 01:06:15,632
If you want to sell in your true love

1118
01:06:15,633 --> 01:06:17,089
you grind coriander seeds

1119
01:06:17,090 --> 01:06:19,859
while you chant to light
candles anointed with love oil.

1120
01:06:20,232 --> 01:06:21,028
Love oil?

1121
01:06:21,758 --> 01:06:23,447
You used canola instead.

1122
01:06:23,630 --> 01:06:24,573
I am hungry.

1123
01:06:24,889 --> 01:06:27,169
Let's get some Coco Crispies
to hold us over.

1124
01:06:27,647 --> 01:06:29,316
You the letters right?
From Zack.

1125
01:06:34,207 --> 01:06:38,410
Come together.
Let this grinding be a tether.

1126
01:06:43,835 --> 01:06:47,090
Were have you been? I've been calling,
e-mailing, text messaging.

1127
01:06:47,091 --> 01:06:49,442
I'm dying to tell you something.
Marty said I should wait.

1128
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:51,619
- Marty?
- Yeah.

1129
01:06:52,606 --> 01:06:56,009
What, cause he didn't want me
upset until the shows were done?

1130
01:06:56,348 --> 01:06:57,048
I don't know.

1131
01:06:57,406 --> 01:06:58,338
Unbelievable.

1132
01:06:58,527 --> 01:06:59,305
Hey listen...

1133
01:07:01,223 --> 01:07:04,118
Listen, they want me to
do a mid-season pilot.

1134
01:07:04,566 --> 01:07:07,262
Ok, well what's that got to do
with what you have to tell me?

1135
01:07:07,341 --> 01:07:09,186
That's it.
It is what I have to tell you.

1136
01:07:09,522 --> 01:07:10,834
What about Brianna?

1137
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:11,985
What about her?

1138
01:07:12,271 --> 01:07:15,696
Don't make me look like an idiot.
I know what's going on.

1139
01:07:15,917 --> 01:07:18,351
If you guys are
getting involved don't....

1140
01:07:18,482 --> 01:07:21,003
Don't hang around and pretend
you care about me.

1141
01:07:21,038 --> 01:07:22,576
What?
Where's this coming from?

1142
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:27,512
This came in mail.

1143
01:07:30,124 --> 01:07:32,666
Well this is craz...
Someone is obviously screwing with you.

1144
01:07:32,753 --> 01:07:33,881
It is what I thought.

1145
01:07:34,046 --> 01:07:36,351
Someone must be screwing with
me by playing with your phone.

1146
01:07:36,352 --> 01:07:38,656
But is the department of motor
vehicles screwing with me?

1147
01:07:38,761 --> 01:07:41,476
And is the sound department
also screwing with me

1148
01:07:41,477 --> 01:07:43,279
when I heard you hitting on Brianna?

1149
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:45,479
Hitting on Brianna!
Are you smoking crack?

1150
01:07:45,688 --> 01:07:48,250
- You were flirting with her.
- You told me to?

1151
01:07:48,873 --> 01:07:50,052
Why would I do that?

1152
01:07:50,117 --> 01:07:52,851
Because you said that she needs
to think everyone's crazy about her.

1153
01:07:53,117 --> 01:07:54,049
I never said that.

1154
01:07:54,332 --> 01:07:55,146
That's not what I heard.

1155
01:07:55,147 --> 01:07:56,147
I knew this would happen.

1156
01:07:56,148 --> 01:07:57,931
You're a big shot.
You're on TV.

1157
01:07:57,932 --> 01:08:00,250
So you want to to get
back at all the females

1158
01:08:00,251 --> 01:08:01,713
that didn't appreciate
you in high school

1159
01:08:01,714 --> 01:08:02,414
- so
- Oh...

1160
01:08:02,415 --> 01:08:05,270
you have to get all the
cute young girls you possibly can.

1161
01:08:05,330 --> 01:08:08,099
I don't want cute young girls!
I want you!

1162
01:08:09,523 --> 01:08:10,909
- You know what I mean.
- All right, get out!

1163
01:08:11,049 --> 01:08:13,760
I am too old for these
high school dramatics.

1164
01:08:13,761 --> 01:08:14,761
You're the one that's acting adolescent.

1165
01:08:14,762 --> 01:08:17,484
- I'm upset not acting adolescent.
- Hey, how you two kids getting along?

1166
01:08:17,485 --> 01:08:20,121
Oh God, please tell me
you're wearing shorts under that.

1167
01:08:20,295 --> 01:08:23,059
Yes. But there just cut really high.

1168
01:08:23,079 --> 01:08:25,841
Dude besides I've got good legs
and a great butt.

1169
01:08:26,478 --> 01:08:28,150
Yeah well,
you know that's what everyone says.

1170
01:08:28,151 --> 01:08:32,005
- "There's Nathan, what an ass."
- Uh hey, don't let me interrupt.

1171
01:08:32,074 --> 01:08:33,678
- He was just leaving.
- No I wasn't.

1172
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:36,494
Get out!
We are done with this discussion!

1173
01:08:36,773 --> 01:08:40,281
You can tell when she's really angry,
her voice gets all high and squeaky.

1174
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:40,982
Yeah.

1175
01:08:40,990 --> 01:08:42,665
Look I'll admit that
something sketchy's going on.

1176
01:08:42,666 --> 01:08:44,155
And I've never even been
in a car with Brianna.

1177
01:08:44,213 --> 01:08:46,740
But if you don't believe me
we've got serious trust issues.

1178
01:08:46,854 --> 01:08:48,621
Exactly!
I always said that.

1179
01:08:48,976 --> 01:08:52,371
- What has this got to do with you?
- Only everything.

1180
01:08:52,481 --> 01:08:55,917
This is the first guy you've dated in 10
years that I can actually hang out with.

1181
01:08:56,047 --> 01:08:59,411
And I do not want you making the same
mistakes with him that you made with me.

1182
01:08:59,771 --> 01:09:02,504
I am trying to be Bruce Willisy.

1183
01:09:03,688 --> 01:09:05,847
Which is great because
I'm trying to be Ashton.

1184
01:09:06,995 --> 01:09:09,029
Which in turn would make her Deme.

1185
01:09:09,314 --> 01:09:13,319
Yeah or Demi or Dem... no I think Dem...
One which is Dem... I actually it's Dem...

1186
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:15,835
- Yeah the thing is Demi. Well um...
- Is she nice?

1187
01:09:15,836 --> 01:09:17,877
Yeah she's very nice.
But I think she's a Demi.

1188
01:09:17,878 --> 01:09:21,552
- I don't think she cares if she's a Deme
- What are you two idiots talking about!

1189
01:09:21,735 --> 01:09:24,919
I am not Demi! You are not Aston!
And you...

1190
01:09:25,370 --> 01:09:27,466
are defiantly not Bruce Willis!

1191
01:09:27,642 --> 01:09:28,935
- See how high it gets?
- Yeah.

1192
01:09:28,936 --> 01:09:31,764
After my bachelor party
only dogs could hear.

1193
01:09:31,927 --> 01:09:32,627
I believe it.

1194
01:09:32,878 --> 01:09:35,520
Look, this is crazy all right, I'll....
Let's just calm down.

1195
01:09:35,521 --> 01:09:36,666
Get out!
- No!

1196
01:09:36,667 --> 01:09:37,367
Go!

1197
01:09:38,495 --> 01:09:40,081
I'm g...
OK, I'm going to go. But...

1198
01:09:40,082 --> 01:09:41,693
we're not done here.
I'm going to call you.

1199
01:09:42,923 --> 01:09:44,816
- Hey...
- No!

1200
01:09:44,985 --> 01:09:46,433
You were going to throw it anyway.

1201
01:09:46,853 --> 01:09:48,356
- Fine.
- Thank you.

1202
01:09:49,153 --> 01:09:51,224
Izzie!
Let's go honey.

1203
01:09:51,634 --> 01:09:53,850
No boyfriend,
no job.

1204
01:09:54,487 --> 01:09:57,628
Just a lonely spinster with a kid.
You happy now?

1205
01:09:58,582 --> 01:10:00,177
I'm watching, just a minute.

1206
01:10:00,669 --> 01:10:02,141
You know this makes allot of sense,

1207
01:10:02,319 --> 01:10:05,363
Mrs. Robinson is
sophisticated and gorgeous.

1208
01:10:05,782 --> 01:10:08,517
She gives this kid
the best sex of his life,

1209
01:10:08,518 --> 01:10:10,488
asks for nothing in return,

1210
01:10:10,494 --> 01:10:12,928
he, pulls a Soon-Ye, dumps her,

1211
01:10:13,150 --> 01:10:15,289
and she's supposed to be the monster.

1212
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:20,082
Could you not get crumbs all over?

1213
01:10:21,197 --> 01:10:25,010
Why? It's not as if anybody
sleeps on this side of the bed.

1214
01:10:41,905 --> 01:10:42,735
What's wrong?

1215
01:10:42,886 --> 01:10:45,296
Why does something have to be wrong?

1216
01:10:45,775 --> 01:10:46,644
OK.

1217
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:53,068
Katy is such a bitch!

1218
01:10:53,369 --> 01:10:56,077
She's standing by the snack
truck and she tells everyone:

1219
01:10:56,078 --> 01:10:57,900
"I think I'll go out with Dylan".

1220
01:10:57,901 --> 01:11:01,046
And she knows I love him
because Colin told her.

1221
01:11:01,345 --> 01:11:03,385
So Melanie says "You
know that Izzie likes him."

1222
01:11:03,386 --> 01:11:04,100
And she goes:

1223
01:11:04,101 --> 01:11:07,524
"Yeah, well just because Izzie likes
him doesn't make them a couple."

1224
01:11:07,889 --> 01:11:09,147
Can you believe her?

1225
01:11:09,341 --> 01:11:12,796
She doesn't even like him.
She's just jocking me.

1226
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:14,132
What's jocking?

1227
01:11:14,493 --> 01:11:17,365
Copying, and don't put it in your show.

1228
01:11:17,599 --> 01:11:19,467
Did you tell Katy how you feel?

1229
01:11:19,878 --> 01:11:20,578
No.

1230
01:11:22,082 --> 01:11:23,619
Can I change my name to Drew?

1231
01:11:24,193 --> 01:11:25,717
What's wrong with Izzie?

1232
01:11:25,956 --> 01:11:28,550
Nothing.
Could you just call me Drew from now on?

1233
01:11:34,691 --> 01:11:37,548
I hate this place.
Why do I have to try on pants?

1234
01:11:37,648 --> 01:11:40,118
You can't keep wearing
the same ratty jeans everyday.

1235
01:11:40,119 --> 01:11:41,243
Why don't we just buy them?

1236
01:11:41,343 --> 01:11:44,801
I don't feel like driving back and forth
1000 times exchanging them.

1237
01:11:47,698 --> 01:11:49,373
I look like a cow.

1238
01:11:49,550 --> 01:11:50,861
Does the waist fit?

1239
01:11:51,671 --> 01:11:55,095
- Their humongous.
- I just need to see the waist size.

1240
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:56,334
They don't fit.

1241
01:12:01,817 --> 01:12:03,612
- Their too small for me.
- They look good.

1242
01:12:04,024 --> 01:12:05,711
- They won't close.
- Oh.

1243
01:12:05,828 --> 01:12:08,337
- Well what's the length?
- There tight Ma, forget it.

1244
01:12:08,757 --> 01:12:09,553
I'm to fat!

1245
01:12:10,028 --> 01:12:12,887
My belly is gigantic!
You wouldn't understand!

1246
01:12:12,998 --> 01:12:15,261
You've got a flat stomach
and you're pretty.

1247
01:12:15,262 --> 01:12:19,881
No honey, no, my face this falling down.
Everything is drying out. I'm...

1248
01:12:20,583 --> 01:12:22,913
I'm hurdling toward Cloris Leachman.

1249
01:12:23,158 --> 01:12:26,326
You're young.
You're like a fresh new peach.

1250
01:12:27,170 --> 01:12:30,105
Izzie you're beautiful.
Don't you get it?

1251
01:12:30,106 --> 01:12:33,063
I'm not beautiful!
I'm not even cute!

1252
01:12:33,127 --> 01:12:34,458
I'm an ugly pig!

1253
01:12:40,220 --> 01:12:41,941
Oooh, waggle string.

1254
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:43,753
Can I have these?

1255
01:12:45,613 --> 01:12:46,580
Yeah.

1256
01:12:47,472 --> 01:12:48,855
Bet Adam sent them.

1257
01:12:52,592 --> 01:12:55,604
All right, what's the dealeo?
Why aren't you on the set?

1258
01:12:56,328 --> 01:12:57,488
This is shit.

1259
01:12:57,823 --> 01:13:00,114
Look, you told me you'd get
me the "You Go Girl" writers.

1260
01:13:00,115 --> 01:13:01,052
But you didn't get me Rosie.

1261
01:13:01,196 --> 01:13:03,617
That's a whole extra producer.
I don't need that.

1262
01:13:03,683 --> 01:13:07,038
When I took this job you promised
me the whole "You Go Girl" group.

1263
01:13:07,269 --> 01:13:08,852
You've got those two writers.

1264
01:13:08,937 --> 01:13:10,225
Yeah, but that's not the group.

1265
01:13:10,517 --> 01:13:13,338
That's like giving me the News
minus Huey Lewis.

1266
01:13:13,401 --> 01:13:16,467
Look kid you are blowing
a jinormous chance.

1267
01:13:16,473 --> 01:13:19,779
You going to give up you're big shot
to be loyal to some broad?

1268
01:13:19,780 --> 01:13:21,136
Is that how you want to roll?

1269
01:13:21,138 --> 01:13:24,392
As a matter of fact Sinatra,
that's exactly how I want to roll.

1270
01:13:25,304 --> 01:13:26,877
I'll be back when you get her.

1271
01:13:27,689 --> 01:13:29,471
Hey Dawson,

1272
01:13:29,472 --> 01:13:30,769
let me give you some advice.

1273
01:13:30,770 --> 01:13:33,102
You're going to want to
cut those apron strings.

1274
01:13:33,103 --> 01:13:35,240
Otherwise you're never
going to be a real man.

1275
01:13:35,389 --> 01:13:38,391
I don't need to be a real man.
I'm an actor.

1276
01:13:40,379 --> 01:13:41,289
Ma?!

1277
01:13:43,306 --> 01:13:44,006
Hey,

1278
01:13:44,322 --> 01:13:46,961
don't you want to make
be a high fiber breakfast?

1279
01:13:47,484 --> 01:13:49,624
Like you would ever eat such a thing.

1280
01:13:50,026 --> 01:13:51,760
Just have you're Lucky Charms.

1281
01:14:08,374 --> 01:14:09,153
Hello.

1282
01:14:09,212 --> 01:14:13,849
Hey, that's quite a
Frankenstein you created there.

1283
01:14:13,949 --> 01:14:15,476
What are you talking about?

1284
01:14:15,515 --> 01:14:18,345
That Adam kid.
He doesn't like the scripts. He...

1285
01:14:18,435 --> 01:14:21,414
doesn't take direction. They tell me
he doesn't trust anyone but you.

1286
01:14:22,668 --> 01:14:25,232
So I'm thinking, maybe
you'd like to come down

1287
01:14:25,233 --> 01:14:28,230
and be supervising
producer on "The Shizzle."

1288
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:31,361
I'm thinking...
maybe not.

1289
01:14:31,751 --> 01:14:33,838
You're thinking maybe not?

1290
01:14:34,164 --> 01:14:35,797
Maybe not?!

1291
01:14:35,980 --> 01:14:37,628
Well I'm thinking shit!

1292
01:14:47,956 --> 01:14:51,502
<i>Strutting bucks walk shoulder
to shoulder sizing each other up.</i>

1293
01:14:52,181 --> 01:14:55,445
<i>While the females wait to attach
themselves to the strongest males.</i>

1294
01:14:55,828 --> 01:14:58,133
<i>Bucks lock antlers in mortal combat.</i>

1295
01:14:59,214 --> 01:15:02,918
<i>Whoever is victorious will intrigante
and then trick females of the herd.</i>

1296
01:15:03,599 --> 01:15:06,718
<i>The challenger leaves in humiliation
without sewing his seed.</i>

1297
01:15:07,015 --> 01:15:08,247
So that's how it is.

1298
01:15:08,470 --> 01:15:11,733
Most powerful male gets
most babalusious female.

1299
01:15:11,739 --> 01:15:12,480
That's right.

1300
01:15:13,707 --> 01:15:16,771
Well what if there's a
really cute male antelope

1301
01:15:16,772 --> 01:15:19,490
or a female that shows
signs of leadership?

1302
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:20,627
- Useless
- Why?

1303
01:15:21,038 --> 01:15:24,084
Look, there's an order
to this mayhem business.

1304
01:15:24,222 --> 01:15:25,891
Why can't we change things?

1305
01:15:26,088 --> 01:15:30,204
Haven't you self centered pet cloning
assholes changed enough?

1306
01:15:30,373 --> 01:15:31,538
It's not natural.

1307
01:15:31,638 --> 01:15:33,359
What's so great about natural?

1308
01:15:33,434 --> 01:15:34,531
- What?
- Think about it.

1309
01:15:34,986 --> 01:15:36,047
Tobacco's natural.

1310
01:15:36,048 --> 01:15:38,447
Prozac's unnatural.
Earthquakes are natural.

1311
01:15:38,448 --> 01:15:39,779
Television's unnatural.

1312
01:15:40,334 --> 01:15:41,746
Natural sucks.

1313
01:15:42,911 --> 01:15:44,817
She can't seem to stay on task.

1314
01:15:44,818 --> 01:15:48,669
Her homework is tardy.
Her language is crude.

1315
01:15:48,736 --> 01:15:52,175
Also, there's far too much
socializing with her neighbors.

1316
01:15:52,176 --> 01:15:54,758
Now, I know you're a working woman.

1317
01:15:55,006 --> 01:15:58,927
But I was hoping for
a little more discipline at home.

1318
01:15:59,027 --> 01:15:59,895
Well the thing is...

1319
01:16:00,621 --> 01:16:02,130
Izzie just got her period.

1320
01:16:02,131 --> 01:16:05,855
And she's had really
extreme mood swings.

1321
01:16:05,856 --> 01:16:08,059
Believe me I'm well aware of puberty.

1322
01:16:08,790 --> 01:16:12,325
Well,
did you know that a girls test scores

1323
01:16:12,326 --> 01:16:15,309
can very up to 20 points at
different times in her cycle.

1324
01:16:15,409 --> 01:16:18,642
And not to mention the fact
that even female teachers

1325
01:16:18,643 --> 01:16:21,273
start giving lower grades
to girls as they develop.

1326
01:16:21,353 --> 01:16:24,348
That's preposterous!
Why would teachers do such a thing?

1327
01:16:24,359 --> 01:16:25,753
You tell me.
I mean... Well...

1328
01:16:26,063 --> 01:16:28,672
Why did she get this and this and this

1329
01:16:28,705 --> 01:16:31,438
and these three questions
wrong when the answers are right?

1330
01:16:33,438 --> 01:16:35,829
Because she didn't
show her work correctly.

1331
01:16:36,148 --> 01:16:37,382
But she got it right.

1332
01:16:37,497 --> 01:16:41,480
The standardized tests require
her to get to the answer a certain way.

1333
01:16:41,579 --> 01:16:43,570
But her mind works a different way.

1334
01:16:43,769 --> 01:16:49,613
Well my job is to get the students
to do well on the standardized tests.

1335
01:16:49,759 --> 01:16:53,765
Wouldn't it be better to encourage girls
to feel good about math and science

1336
01:16:53,766 --> 01:16:56,615
instead of tricking them into
thinking they are stupid?

1337
01:16:56,979 --> 01:16:57,745
I've got an idea,

1338
01:16:58,070 --> 01:17:00,195
why don't you teach her
to stop the potty mouth

1339
01:17:00,196 --> 01:17:02,816
and let me teach her to
take the standardized tests?

1340
01:17:02,817 --> 01:17:03,946
I've got a better idea.

1341
01:17:04,140 --> 01:17:08,100
Why don't you take the standardized
tests and shove it up your ass.

1342
01:17:09,676 --> 01:17:12,317
Well at least I see where
the language comes from.

1343
01:17:13,123 --> 01:17:13,870
Honey.

1344
01:17:15,246 --> 01:17:17,139
You're the best Mom ever.

1345
01:17:19,061 --> 01:17:20,010
Let's get out of here.

1346
01:17:21,628 --> 01:17:25,662
<i>Young girl, wants to be a big name.</i>

1347
01:17:26,091 --> 01:17:30,418
<i>In movies they must all be the same.</i>

1348
01:17:30,824 --> 01:17:35,403
<i>She won't need to sing or to act.</i>

1349
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:39,781
<i>Just loose all of her body fat.</i>

1350
01:17:40,117 --> 01:17:41,925
<i>And isn't it moronic.</i>

1351
01:17:42,815 --> 01:17:43,856
<i>Don't you think?</i>

1352
01:17:44,509 --> 01:17:46,518
<i>It's insane!</i>

1353
01:17:46,569 --> 01:17:51,060
Izz, when ever you sing that part
in the car you really belt it out.

1354
01:17:51,061 --> 01:17:53,957
Oh yeah, that's the screaming part
but I decided to sing it regular.

1355
01:17:53,982 --> 01:17:54,778
How come?

1356
01:17:55,102 --> 01:17:58,572
Because everyone will be at the show,
Dylan will be there.

1357
01:17:59,144 --> 01:17:59,844
So?

1358
01:17:59,845 --> 01:18:02,420
Sometimes I hit the not
really good you know and...

1359
01:18:02,828 --> 01:18:04,458
But sometimes I don't and I just...

1360
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:06,203
I don't want to take chances.

1361
01:18:06,636 --> 01:18:08,571
It doesn't matter if you
hit the note or not.

1362
01:18:09,264 --> 01:18:11,221
As long as you just go for it.

1363
01:18:11,583 --> 01:18:13,403
Dive in!
Balls out!

1364
01:18:13,404 --> 01:18:15,681
As long as you give it all you've got.

1365
01:18:15,682 --> 01:18:17,660
No ones going to care if it's on the...

1366
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:20,843
Da the uh...
The thing.

1367
01:18:21,103 --> 01:18:22,751
- Key?
- Yeah.

1368
01:18:23,493 --> 01:18:25,017
And don't try to be safe.

1369
01:18:25,526 --> 01:18:28,716
<i>It's insane.</i>

1370
01:18:28,717 --> 01:18:30,852
<i>That they lose so much weight.</i>

1371
01:18:30,853 --> 01:18:36,086
<i>It's young and cold,
but no food on her plate.</i>

1372
01:18:36,087 --> 01:18:38,730
<i>It's a common thing</i>

1373
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:41,271
<i>barfing up a cake.</i>

1374
01:18:41,295 --> 01:18:43,608
<i>They think they're all two</i>

1375
01:18:43,829 --> 01:18:46,608
<i>stick figures.</i>

1376
01:18:46,662 --> 01:18:47,904
Sounds great!

1377
01:18:48,871 --> 01:18:49,571
<i>Action.</i>

1378
01:18:50,418 --> 01:18:51,118
<i>Quiet!</i>

1379
01:18:52,612 --> 01:18:56,175
<i>"Dear Rosie, I'm sorry I didn't have
time to give you two weeks notice"</i>

1380
01:18:56,176 --> 01:19:00,286
<i>"but I got a job on "The Shizzle",
Best luck Jeannie"</i>

1381
01:19:01,289 --> 01:19:01,989
Hello.

1382
01:19:02,133 --> 01:19:04,603
<i>They've offered you a really nice bump.</i>

1383
01:19:04,604 --> 01:19:05,304
I uh...

1384
01:19:05,887 --> 01:19:07,776
I just don't want to do it Stove.

1385
01:19:07,777 --> 01:19:08,842
<i>You want me to tell them that</i>

1386
01:19:08,843 --> 01:19:10,415
<i>and then we'll see what
they come back with?</i>

1387
01:19:13,571 --> 01:19:16,235
They've called about 4 or 500 times.

1388
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:19,124
What're you going to do Hickum?

1389
01:19:19,717 --> 01:19:20,943
I'll never be God.

1390
01:19:22,177 --> 01:19:25,204
Whenever some chess club
is gettin' pounded on.

1391
01:19:25,534 --> 01:19:26,586
I'll be there.

1392
01:19:27,697 --> 01:19:30,633
Whenever somebody's flossin' about
how he bitch slapped the little guy.

1393
01:19:30,965 --> 01:19:31,991
I'll be there.

1394
01:19:32,686 --> 01:19:36,235
And when ever Melvins band together
to open up a can of whoopass.

1395
01:19:36,236 --> 01:19:37,367
I'll be there.

1396
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:48,658
Ok, we can't use whoopass so lets
use smack down on the hater thing.

1397
01:19:48,659 --> 01:19:50,243
Can I see the dailies
for the beach scene?

1398
01:19:54,422 --> 01:19:55,413
Don't bite my stuff.

1399
01:19:55,414 --> 01:19:57,687
Oh wait, sorry, sorry.
Can I do that again?

1400
01:19:59,850 --> 01:20:00,550
<i>Action!</i>

1401
01:20:02,373 --> 01:20:04,976
When we called Pink.
I said shotgun.

1402
01:20:04,977 --> 01:20:07,762
You know what if this were 1990
I would say talk to the hand.

1403
01:20:07,763 --> 01:20:10,170
But since it's not, my
hand won't be bothered.

1404
01:20:25,787 --> 01:20:28,506
<i>You said that Brianna needs
to think everybody's crazy about her.</i>

1405
01:20:28,507 --> 01:20:29,545
<i>I never said that.</i>

1406
01:20:30,863 --> 01:20:34,764
<i>And Jan is in love with him.
And she's past aggressive.</i>

1407
01:20:34,765 --> 01:20:35,465
<i>Past what?</i>

1408
01:20:36,623 --> 01:20:38,149
<i>You know, past aggressive.</i>

1409
01:20:38,554 --> 01:20:42,516
<i>People who act all friendly
but really aren't. Like Jeannie.</i>

1410
01:20:43,153 --> 01:20:45,176
<i>Look what I made Brianna.
And Sean.</i>

1411
01:20:45,517 --> 01:20:46,517
It's hilarious.

1412
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:07,033
Hey come in.

1413
01:21:07,846 --> 01:21:11,247
So, what is the hold
you have over this kid?

1414
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:14,875
I believed in him and he knows it.
I'm the one that brought him to you.

1415
01:21:14,914 --> 01:21:17,314
Oh yeah.
How do you like that.

1416
01:21:17,628 --> 01:21:18,822
You're such a putz.

1417
01:21:19,239 --> 01:21:22,324
But if you want me to consider your
offer you have to do something first.

1418
01:21:22,408 --> 01:21:23,174
Anything.

1419
01:21:23,274 --> 01:21:25,469
Get rid of Jeannie, my old secretary.

1420
01:21:25,587 --> 01:21:27,226
That's gonna be kind of tough.

1421
01:21:27,672 --> 01:21:30,640
- Why?
- It's just tough firing people.

1422
01:21:30,699 --> 01:21:32,839
When did you start
caring about secretaries?

1423
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:34,980
You fired everyone you ever slept with.

1424
01:21:35,576 --> 01:21:36,511
It's me or her.

1425
01:21:37,259 --> 01:21:38,137
OK.

1426
01:21:38,542 --> 01:21:39,338
What?

1427
01:21:39,544 --> 01:21:42,604
Listen zippo, you even think
about it and I'll go to your wife.

1428
01:21:42,705 --> 01:21:43,405
Ow sweetie...

1429
01:21:43,406 --> 01:21:44,106
Go ahead

1430
01:21:44,182 --> 01:21:47,141
and I'll show her your
little photography project

1431
01:21:47,142 --> 01:21:48,834
and tell her what a little liar you are.

1432
01:21:48,835 --> 01:21:51,361
You dried out old bitch!

1433
01:21:51,909 --> 01:21:55,047
Why don't you hasbeens
ever move over for young talent?

1434
01:21:55,396 --> 01:21:58,583
Since when did screwing producers and
eating craft services become a talent?

1435
01:21:59,391 --> 01:22:01,764
- Wow, look ladies...
- Now what am I supposed to do?

1436
01:22:01,863 --> 01:22:02,933
Where am I gonna work?

1437
01:22:03,115 --> 01:22:06,183
I'm sure you could get your old
corner back on Hollywood Boulevard.

1438
01:22:10,425 --> 01:22:11,502
<i>There there there.</i>

1439
01:22:18,905 --> 01:22:19,638
<i>Oh!</i>

1440
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:23,536
<i>She hit me.</i>

1441
01:22:26,605 --> 01:22:27,400
We'll talk.

1442
01:22:34,113 --> 01:22:35,585
Wow that was fun.

1443
01:22:36,475 --> 01:22:39,070
<i>Listen parents, the talent show's
about to begin.</i>

1444
01:22:42,861 --> 01:22:44,692
I always knew Jeannie was a psycho.

1445
01:22:46,388 --> 01:22:47,878
She must of really liked me.

1446
01:22:48,108 --> 01:22:49,598
Ah, how can you blame her,
I mean...?

1447
01:22:50,299 --> 01:22:51,231
Poor thing.

1448
01:22:56,690 --> 01:22:57,390
I'm sorry.

1449
01:22:58,091 --> 01:23:00,021
I was an immature baby.

1450
01:23:01,259 --> 01:23:01,959
Well...

1451
01:23:03,683 --> 01:23:05,269
It's to be expected at your age.

1452
01:23:05,678 --> 01:23:07,234
No, I should have trusted you.

1453
01:23:07,235 --> 01:23:11,111
I just got so paranoid you'd leave me.
Because I'm such an old hag.

1454
01:23:11,146 --> 01:23:13,911
I'm not that superficial,
I don't care how old you are.

1455
01:23:13,912 --> 01:23:16,272
- You don't?
- No I just care how much you weigh.

1456
01:23:19,390 --> 01:23:22,009
Oh nice!
That's really nice.

1457
01:23:22,119 --> 01:23:22,983
What's that?

1458
01:23:29,358 --> 01:23:32,461
Ladies and gentlemen our PTA chairman
Sally Plummer.

1459
01:23:33,267 --> 01:23:35,632
Welcome to another school spring fling.

1460
01:23:35,911 --> 01:23:38,215
You know spring is a time of renewal
and...

1461
01:23:38,573 --> 01:23:41,710
and that's why we're so delighted
to see all you fathers out there

1462
01:23:41,711 --> 01:23:43,712
with you're second and third wives.

1463
01:23:44,696 --> 01:23:46,373
Everybody's a comedian.

1464
01:23:46,374 --> 01:23:50,964
Uh, So with out further adieu
our MC for the day Dylan Nicholson.

1465
01:23:54,664 --> 01:23:57,206
Everyone, I'm Dylan and I'm an alcoholic.

1466
01:23:58,614 --> 01:24:00,637
And then school I'd
like to introduce to you,

1467
01:24:00,796 --> 01:24:02,046
You know 'em, you love 'em,

1468
01:24:02,354 --> 01:24:04,853
Melanie, Jane and Izzie!

1469
01:24:08,470 --> 01:24:09,470
Go Izzie!

1470
01:24:10,623 --> 01:24:14,367
<i>So hot, must be 98.</i>

1471
01:24:14,935 --> 01:24:18,375
<i>September, that's not so great.</i>

1472
01:24:18,809 --> 01:24:22,577
<i>Where the north pole is turning slush.</i>

1473
01:24:23,018 --> 01:24:26,798
<i>On my TV there's President Bush.</i>

1474
01:24:26,799 --> 01:24:30,124
<i>And isn't he moronic?
Don't you think?</i>

1475
01:24:30,154 --> 01:24:32,283
<i>Incredibly moronic.</i>

1476
01:24:33,386 --> 01:24:34,985
<i>And yet you really do think.</i>

1477
01:24:35,297 --> 01:24:40,250
<i>He's a pain,
in the whole world's ass.</i>

1478
01:24:40,297 --> 01:24:45,046
<i>He saps them all,
for a gallon of gas.</i>

1479
01:24:45,047 --> 01:24:49,729
<i>How can it be,
we voted him in?</i>

1480
01:24:50,122 --> 01:24:54,764
<i>I just don't see how it figures.</i>

1481
01:24:54,959 --> 01:24:59,142
<i>The pop star,
who went on TV.</i>

1482
01:24:59,312 --> 01:25:03,845
<i>To this whole world,
can't sleep here with me.</i>

1483
01:25:04,637 --> 01:25:09,080
<i>Mother says to son,</i>

1484
01:25:09,235 --> 01:25:13,001
<i>Neverland ranch will be lots of fun.</i>

1485
01:25:13,465 --> 01:25:14,873
<i>Isn't it moronic,</i>

1486
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:16,559
That's my daughter.

1487
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:17,783
<i>don't you think?</i>

1488
01:25:17,784 --> 01:25:18,484
That's my daughter.

1489
01:25:18,485 --> 01:25:22,316
<i>Technically moronic.
And yes I really do think.</i>

1490
01:25:22,814 --> 01:25:27,633
<i>It's all lame,
but the dog and the cat.</i>

1491
01:25:27,634 --> 01:25:32,356
<i>Too big is small,
till along came your Dad.</i>

1492
01:25:32,921 --> 01:25:37,153
<i>He won't like them when they're bigger.</i>

1493
01:25:56,244 --> 01:25:57,834
Wasn't that the best?!

1494
01:25:57,835 --> 01:25:59,178
Oh, what a voice!

1495
01:25:59,179 --> 01:26:01,039
What a voice!
She gets that from me.

1496
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:03,071
- You hurt your face.
- No, no.

1497
01:26:03,143 --> 01:26:05,110
I got a chin implant.

1498
01:26:05,310 --> 01:26:08,185
Yeah, they say if you extend your chin
you don't need a face lift.

1499
01:26:08,425 --> 01:26:10,584
- Oh cool.
- Where is she anyway?

1500
01:26:15,980 --> 01:26:18,196
- I'm going to go congratulate her.
- No! No, leave her alone.

1501
01:26:18,301 --> 01:26:19,672
See whats going on?

1502
01:26:20,157 --> 01:26:23,286
Hey, Izzie.
You want a slushie?

1503
01:26:24,542 --> 01:26:25,242
Ok

1504
01:26:26,002 --> 01:26:26,991
See ya.

1505
01:26:28,334 --> 01:26:30,571
How did you knew that
was going to happen?

1506
01:26:30,766 --> 01:26:32,166
I'm a Mom.

1507
01:26:42,446 --> 01:26:44,426
Don't get too excited about him.

1508
01:26:44,450 --> 01:26:46,034
Now what's your problem?

1509
01:26:46,464 --> 01:26:49,488
Remember the "This will never
work he's too young" scene?

1510
01:26:49,489 --> 01:26:52,891
Well eventually you'll hit
the repay button on that one.

1511
01:26:53,187 --> 01:26:55,964
So it might not last.
You could say that about anyone.

1512
01:26:55,996 --> 01:26:58,728
Besides,
that isn't what I was looking at.

1513
01:27:01,182 --> 01:27:02,315
I liked your song.

1514
01:27:03,445 --> 01:27:04,216
You did?

1515
01:27:04,657 --> 01:27:05,419
Uh huh.

1516
01:27:06,223 --> 01:27:08,534
I liked when you said
you're an alcoholic.

1517
01:27:10,198 --> 01:27:12,155
Do you like video games?

1518
01:27:13,182 --> 01:27:14,043
Sure.

1519
01:27:15,009 --> 01:27:17,342
Do you ever play apes escape?

1520
01:27:20,681 --> 01:27:24,164
No but, maybe you could teach me.

1521
01:27:44,553 --> 01:27:46,853
Oh my God!
Look at her.

1522
01:27:47,976 --> 01:27:49,737
Nothing that could ever happen to me,

1523
01:27:50,101 --> 01:27:54,933
comes close to how happy I am to
see her kiss Dylan and get applause.

1524
01:27:55,232 --> 01:27:56,123
Hello?

1525
01:27:56,786 --> 01:27:59,101
Who do you think set it up this way?

1526
01:27:59,713 --> 01:28:04,156
So your body rots.
And your shows are stale.

1527
01:28:04,477 --> 01:28:06,543
Look who you're making room for.

1528
01:28:07,910 --> 01:28:10,096
Well, when you put it like that...

1529
01:28:10,387 --> 01:28:11,595
This is good.

1530
01:28:11,724 --> 01:28:14,399
Now you can settle down
and act your age.

1531
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:17,843
What's that supposed to mean?
Easy listening, and orthopedic shoes?

1532
01:28:18,195 --> 01:28:19,670
That sounds about right.
Yeah.

1533
01:28:19,941 --> 01:28:22,385
Nope, I don't want to do that.
I want to stay passionate.

1534
01:28:22,386 --> 01:28:25,996
I want to scream at rock concerts,
and get angry at the news.

1535
01:28:25,997 --> 01:28:27,604
And I want to wear miniskirts.

1536
01:28:27,635 --> 01:28:29,129
You're going to look ridiculous.

1537
01:28:29,350 --> 01:28:31,682
Yeah.
Well, enough people are ridiculous,

1538
01:28:32,343 --> 01:28:33,741
it starts to look normal.
