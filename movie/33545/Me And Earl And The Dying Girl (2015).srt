1
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,660
我不知该如何讲述这个故事
I have no idea how to tell this story.

2
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,430
我甚至不知道该从何说起
I don't even know how to start it.

3
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,660
也许我可以引用那些
Like, I guess I could use one of those classic

4
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:13,430
经典小说的开头
story beginning sentences.

5
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:16,500
"那是最美好的时代 那是最糟糕的时代"
"It was the best of times; it was the worst of times."

6
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,200
但是这句子究竟是什么意思?
But what would that even mean?

7
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,070
我是说 显然对世间某处
I mean, obviously, somewhere in the world,

8
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:23,370
某人而言 这是最美好的时代
it's the best of times for someone.

9
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,270
例如他正在享用丰盛的
Like he's eating all this insane

10
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:26,810
越南大餐而无需花钱...
vietnamese food he just got for free...

11
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:28,810
而为他上菜的女士
and the woman who delivered the food

12
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:31,180
像极了"暴动小猫乐队"里的辣妹
looks exactly like the hot girl from Pussy Riot

13
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,350
而现在她正在角落里
and now she's situated in the corner

14
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,650
用竖琴奏出悦耳动听的旋律
playing unspeakably beautiful melodies on the harp,

15
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:37,550
而他只是埋头苦吃
while he's just going to town on that food.

16
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:40,350
所以没错 那是最好的时代
So, yeah, that's the best of times.

17
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,520
而此时此刻的另一人
Meanwhile, some other guy is having

18
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,350
被酷刑高手瓦解了意志...
his will broken by professional torturers...

19
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,690
他们把他吊在满是鳄鱼的酸水池上
who are suspending him over a crocodile-infested pool of acid.

20
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,360
而由于酸水
And because it's acid,

21
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,430
那些鳄鱼都被激怒了
these crocodiles are just pissed.

22
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,590
它们还散发出一种恶心的气味...
And they're also piping in that gross smell you get...

23
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,230
像是撒了许多牛奶
when they spill a bunch of milk

24
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:56,390
在学校停车场上的味道
in the school parking lot.

25
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,260
而这个强壮的行刑人
And this beefy torture dude

26
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,200
正把他打得屁股尿流
is just punching the hell out of him.

27
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,300
最糟糕的时代 达成
Worst of times. Check.

28
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,300
我完全不知道我在干什么

29
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:13,310
好了 看 我就这么开始吧
All right, look. I'll just start.

30
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,340
这故事讲述了我的高三生活
This is the story of my senior year of high school

31
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,240
以及它如何毁掉了我的人生
and how it destroyed my life.

32
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,280
还有我如何拍出烂到确实要了人命的电影
And how I made a film so bad, it literally killed someone.

33
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,280
进入高三篇

34
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,670
我曾如此看待这里:
I used to think about it this way:

35
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,780
仙利高中是一个自成一体的世界
Schenley High School was a world unto itself.

36
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,680
到高三时 我已精通这世界多个国家的
By senior year, I had mastered the languages and customs

37
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,960
语言和风俗
of its various sovereign states.

38
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:00,310
运动员国的点头礼
The head nods of Jock Nation.

39
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,720
瘾君子王国的碰拳礼
The fist bumps of the Kingdom of Stoners.

40
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,550
电影呆子人民共和国
The innocuous witticisms of

41
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,750
那毫无意义的俏皮话
the People's Republic of Theater Dorks.

42
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,150
格雷戈 你夏天过得怎么样?
Greg, how was your summer?

43
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,220
夏天 这个词到底什么意思?
Summer. What does that word even mean?

44
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,190
是更"summ"吗?
Like, more "summ"?

45
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,360
在典型的高中生活里
In a typical high school life,

46
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,490
你总会属于一个国家...
you belong to one nation...

47
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:17,860
那无法使你得到全面保护
which can never guarantee you total security.

48
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,180
但我认为我找到了解决之道
But I thought I found a way out.

49
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,770
取得所有国家的居民身份
Get citizenship in every nation.

50
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:28,170
获得畅通无阻的护照
Get passports to everywhere.

51
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,470
只需和所有人低调和谐相处...
Just be on low-key good terms with everyone...

52
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,670
不时与他们随意交流...
casually interact with them once in a while...

53
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,840
而不引起他人注意
in a way that is invisible to everyone else.

54
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,510
从不参与任何
Never commit to an interaction

55
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,280
不轻松或不成熟的交流
that won't be casual or mellow.

56
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,740
你今天测试/考试吗?
Your test was today?

57
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,850
呃 考试! 我可以体会
Ugh. Tests! I've been there.

58
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,620
这就像派兵去往阿富汗一样
That's like sending troops to Afghanistan.

59
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,620
和逼格最高的国家的公民
Maintain relationships with citizens

60
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,220
保持良好的关系
of the most dicked-upon nations.

61
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,690
比如斯考特·梅休
For example, Scott Mayhew,

62
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,720
就是坐我旁边的哥特风白痴
the gothy dork I'm sitting next to here.

63
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,860
斯考特 这张狂战士出得真棒
Scott, nice Berserker.

64
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,690
我该谢谢你?
Thank you?

65
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,190
耕耘多年才收获了他的信任
It took years of cultivation to win his trust.

66
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,800
又或者是被全世界孤立的"病态菲尔"
Or the universally ostracized Ill Phil.

67
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,830
真的是孤家寡人
Truly a nation of one.

68
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,410
但有些地方是我不能去的
And there were some places I simply couldn't go.

69
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,870
比如学校的餐厅
Like the cafeteria.

70
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,680
这里的每一寸土地都是争议领土
Every last square inch of it was disputed territory.

71
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,450
这就像克里米亚 克什米尔
It was Crimea, Kashmir,

72
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,530
还有加沙地带的混合体
and the Gaza Strip all rolled into one.

73
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:30,950
当然还包括有海盗出没的那片印度洋
Also the part of the Indian Ocean with pirates.

74
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:34,850
是"菲利普船长"电影那种海盗 不是"加勒比海盗"那种
Captain Phillips pirates, not Pirates of the Caribbean.

75
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,860
但是实际上 天知道? 也许两者都有
Although, actually, who knows? Maybe both.

76
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,490
麦卡锡
但是实际上 天知道? 也许两者都有
Although, actually, who knows? Maybe both.

77
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:37,510
麦卡锡

78
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,630
因此我总是在我历史老师的办公室
Instead, I always ate lunch in the office
Burden of Dreams:"梦想的负担" 描写德国电影大师沃纳·赫尔佐格艰难拍摄名片"陆上行舟"的纪录片

79
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,930
吃午餐
of my history teacher.

80
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:47,960
麦卡锡先生
Mr. McCarthy.

81
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,860
注意:
Fact:

82
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,930
我要去309待上...二十分钟
I'm in 309 for the next... 20 minutes.

83
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,840
仙利高中里唯一一个理智的成年人
The only reasonable adult in all of Schenley.

84
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,370
异教徒们
Heathens.

85
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,300
尊重科研
Respect the research.

86
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,510
和厄尔一起吃午餐 他在我人生中的角色
With Earl, whose role in my life

87
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,280
我现在都不想跟你们解释
I'm not even gonna try to explain to you right now.

88
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,780
压倒性的和集体性的谋杀的和谐
The harmony of overwhelming and collective murder.

89
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,880
最后一点 辣妹会毁了你的生活
One last thing. Hot girls destroy your life.

90
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,020
事实就是这样 无论那个辣妹是否是个好人
That 's just the fact. It doesn't matter if the hot girl is also a good person.

91
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,890
她是一头麋鹿 而你是金花鼠
She's a moose, you're a chipmunk.

92
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:21,130
显然她只是在森林里漫步
She's just wandering through the forest, oblivious.

93
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,770
甚至没意识到踩在了你头上
And she doesn't even know that she stomped on your head.
90

94
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:28,530
嗨 麦迪森
Hey, Madison.

95
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,630
嗨 夏天过的怎么样?
Hey, how was your summer?

96
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,260
夏天 这个词究竟什么意思 对吧?
Summer. What does that word even mean, right?

97
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,900
更"summ"
More "summ."

98
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,570
就像冬天 难道是更"wint"吗?
Winter, same deal. More "wint"?

99
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,400
麦卡锡老师在309教室
McCarthy's in 309.

100
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,700
好的 谢谢
Great, thanks.

101
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,640
谦卑于
To become humbled

102
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,610
这里极端的痛苦...
in front of this overwhelming misery...

103
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:50,680
和不可抗拒的通奸
and overwhelming fornication

104
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,410
还有惊人的无秩序
and overwhelming lack of order.

105
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:53,650
咪咪
Titties.

106
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,950
- 亲爱的 我们能进来吗?  - 天啊 天啊!
- Honey, can we come in?  - Jesus, Jesus!

107
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:00,350
进来吧 有什么事吗?
Yeah. What do you want?

108
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,950
首先 我在翻找...
First of all, I was going through...

109
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:04,420
你的杂物然后发现你
your stuff and I saw that you

110
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,020
甚至还没有拆封大学申请指导
have not even unwrapped your college directory.

111
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,720
妈 别翻我的东西
Mom, don't go through my stuff.

112
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,760
我们讨论过了 她有权利看你的东西
We discussed it, and she gets to go through your stuff.

113
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,430
就看一眼 这挺有意思的
Just have a look. It's fun.

114
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,730
这就像为你的未来点菜
It's like a menu for your future.

115
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:16,560
你想来点什么? 来点宾州州立?
What are you in the mood for? Some Penn State?

116
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:19,330
还是佩伯代因大学? 波莫纳? 普林斯顿?
Some Pepperdine? Pomona? Princeton?

117
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,530
我考不上普林斯顿的
I'm not getting into Princeton.

118
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,180
他考不上普林斯顿的
He's not getting into Princeton.

119
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,970
唔 就这事吗?
Um, so, is that it?

120
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,940
不 亲爱的 还有一件事
No, honey, it's not it.

121
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,860
你父亲和我要跟你说件有点悲伤的事情
Your father and I want to talk to you about something kind of sad.

122
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:31,770
什么?
What?

123
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,740
发生了什么?
What happened?

124
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,880
我刚刚和蒂尼斯·库什纳通了电话
Well, I just got off the phone with Denise Kushner,

125
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,050
是瑞秋的妈妈 你认识蒂尼斯吗?
Rachel's mom. You know Denise?

126
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,880
不认识
Um, not really.

127
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,450
但是你总是瑞秋的朋友吧
You're friends with Rachel, though.

128
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:46,890
是啊 我是说我们也就认识而已
Yeah, I mean, we're like, acquainted.

129
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,420
过来
Come here.

130
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,920
好吧
Okay.

131
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,930
瑞秋才刚刚被诊断出了白血病
Rachel's been diagnosed with leukemia.

132
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,460
他们才发现
They just found out.

133
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,500
你今天去检测/考试吗?
Your test was today?

134
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,830
呃 考试! 我可以体会
Ugh. Tests! I've been there.

135
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,370
哦 天啊
Oh, God.

136
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,670
这病严重吗?
Is that serious?

137
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,910
他们在做各种各样的检测
They're doing all kinds of tests.

138
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,070
尽一切方法
They're doing everything they can.

139
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,640
还不知道病情如何
They just don't know.

140
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,540
哦 这真糟
Man, that sucks.

141
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,680
没错
You're right.

142
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,810
真糟
It sucks.

143
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,780
糟透了
It sucks really bad.

144
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,580
不能更糟了
It sucks quite a bit.

145
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,880
是的
Yeah.

146
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,790
爸 老猫斯蒂芬在挠我
Dad, Cat Stevens is clawing me.

147
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,660
他非常心烦意乱
Well, he's deeply distraught.

148
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,690
我刚刚和蒂尼斯打电话的时候...
Well, you know, I was talking to Denise...

149
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:46,090
她觉得你有可能...
and Denise feels that you might be someone...

150
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,490
能让瑞秋高兴点
who could make Rachel feel better.

151
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
但是就像我说的
Yeah, but like I said,

152
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
我们并不是非常熟 所以...
we're not really friends, so...

153
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,730
你就打个电话给瑞秋
Just give Rachel a call.

154
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,530
那你想让我说点什么?
Yeah, well, what do you want me to say?

155
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,840
"嗨 我是格雷戈 就是那个
"Hey, it's Greg, the guy who's

156
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,240
从没注意过你的人...
never really paid attention to you...

157
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,570
但是现在你得了癌症 所以一起玩玩吧"?
but now you have cancer, so let's hang out"?

158
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:02,810
那样可不行
That's not gonna work.

159
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:03,970
她会觉得你是在讽刺她
She'll think you're being sarcastic.

160
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,240
你是想说你就不能
Are you telling me you can't do

161
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,140
为别人做一件好事?
one nice thing for another person?

162
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,180
说真的 是这样吗 真的是这样吗?
I mean, honestly, is that really what's happening here?

163
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,550
好吧 我打
Fine. Okay.

164
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,810
求你们了 别再翻我的东西
Just, please don't go through my stuff.

165
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,150
不然我也会去翻你们的东西
Or I'll start going through your stuff.

166
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:18,820
祝你和卫生棉过得愉快
I hope you like tampons.

167
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:21,750
这里是调频90.5匹兹堡中部电台...
It's Central Pittsburgh on 90.5...

168
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,190
我是瑞秋
This is Rachel.

169
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,930
嘿 我是格雷戈·盖恩斯
Hey, it's Greg Gaines.

170
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:28,930
嗨
Hi.

171
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,030
哟!
Yo!

172
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:35,770
我打给了医生...
So, I called a doctor...

173
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:38,130
他说你需要格雷戈-嘧啶处方药
he said you needed a prescription of Greg-acil.

174
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,380
那是什么?
What's that?

175
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,980
唔...
Uh...

176
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,700
就是我啊
It's me.

177
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,770
是方便服用的胶囊型
In convenient gel-tab form.

178
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,740
哦
Oh.

179
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,080
嗯
Yeah.

180
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:54,510
所以 我猜你听说我生病了
So, I guess you heard I'm sick.

181
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,980
是的
Yeah.

182
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,510
是我妈妈告诉你的吗?
Did my mom tell you?

183
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,120
唔 是我妈妈告诉我的
Um, well, my mom told me.

184
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,120
哦
Oh.

185
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:03,220
那么 唔...
So, um...

186
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:06,220
什么?
What?

187
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,320
你想要说什么?
What were you gonna say?

188
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,060
唔...
Um...

189
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,390
格雷戈 什么事?
Greg, what?

190
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:14,830
唔 好吧 我就是打来看看
Uh, yeah, I was just calling to see

191
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,360
你想不想出去玩
if you wanted to hang out.

192
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,090
现在?
Right now?

193
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:20,190
对啊 当然
Um, sure.

194
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,160
不了 谢谢
No, thanks.

195
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,400
哦
Oh.

196
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,400
好吧 这么说你不想出去?
Okay, so you don't wanna hang out?

197
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,100
不想 谢了
No. Thanks anyways.

198
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,200
好吧 唔 拜
Okay. Um, bye.

199
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:32,570
拜拜
Bye.

200
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,370
妈 你在干什么?
Mom, what are you doing?

201
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,240
好了 妈 听着 她不想见我
Okay, Mom, listen, she doesn't want to see me.

202
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,880
我不想这么和你说但 格雷戈里...
I'm sorry to be the one to tell you, Gregory...

203
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,840
在这件事情上
that you do not have a choice

204
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,280
你别无选择
in this particular matter.

205
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,540
妈 拜托 你听我说完
Mom, please, let me say one thing for one second.

206
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,080
你获得了一个机会
You have been given an opportunity

207
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,180
可以确实改变别人的人生
to make a very real difference in someone's life.

208
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,580
如果你选择在家里
And if what you're choosing instead

209
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,610
整天无所事事...
is to lie around the house all day...

210
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,250
她不想见我!
She doesn't want to see me!

211
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,950
那我只能介入...
I will be required to step in...

212
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:56,050
我们都不是朋友!
We're not even friends!

213
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:58,320
告诉你这完全不可接受
and inform you that that is 100% unacceptable.

214
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,960
你不停唠叨快把我逼疯了!
Your nonstop stream of words is making me freak out!

215
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,290
要是你认为你编造的任何借口
And if you think that all these excuses you're making

216
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:03,990
会好过...
are in any way better...

217
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:06,130
或者重要过身患癌症的
or more important, than the happiness

218
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:07,490
女孩的幸福...
of a girl with cancer...

219
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,130
妈! 我要进入扭曲状态了
Mom! I am now entering a subhuman state.

220
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,430
那人还是你的朋友
a friend with cancer,

221
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:12,300
那你就错得太可悲了 朋友
you are sadly mistaken, my friend.

222
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,100
你要去拿起电话
You are going to pick up that phone.

223
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,570
然后再给瑞秋打一个过去
You're going to call Rachel again.

224
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:20,490
你要这么做 必须这么做
You are going to. You are going to.

225
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:31,490
我与将死的女孩相遇篇

226
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,530
哦 格雷戈
Oh, Greg.

227
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,430
哦 库什纳太太
Oh, Mrs. Kushner.

228
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,370
格雷戈 叫我蒂尼斯
Denise, Greg.

229
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,340
对你来说我就是蒂尼斯 好吗?
To you, I'm Denise, okay?

230
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,500
哦 好的 好
Oh, okay. Good.

231
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:04,170
你真是个好孩子 你知道吗?
You're a real good kid, you know that?

232
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,310
你真是个好孩子 你有着广阔的胸怀
You really are. You just have a big heart.

233
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,280
你很善良 友善
You're kind, nice.

234
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:13,250
我非常欣赏
I really appreciate it.

235
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,620
谢谢
Thank you.

236
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,340
好 好 好 好 好...
Good, good, good, good, good...

237
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,220
好孩子
good boy.

238
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,950
好了
Okay.

239
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,120
你真是一个善良 大度 秀色...
You really are kind, big-hearted, delicious...

240
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:30,190
可餐的年轻人
yummy, yummy, young boy.

241
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:34,290
你又长得这么帅
And you're so, so, handsome.

242
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,960
哦 我可不帅 但还是谢谢
Oh, I'm not handsome, but thank you.

243
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:39,370
还这么谦虚
And so modest.

244
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:40,490
我觉得我是一个谦卑的耗子
I guess I'm a modest mouse.

245
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,400
格雷戈 你是怎么想到这些东西的?
Greg, where do you come up with this stuff?

246
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:48,040
唔 事实上那是一个乐队的名字
Well, that's the name of a band, actually.

247
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,520
哦 好吧
Oh. Yeah.

248
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,570
瑞秋!
Rachel!

249
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:54,380
有一只谦虚的小耗子来看你来了
I've got a modest little mouse here to see you!

250
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,440
瑞秋
Rachel.

251
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:58,110
格雷戈 你来干什么?
Greg, what are you doing here?

252
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,280
唔 这个...
So, uh...

253
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,010
医生真的推荐
the doctor really recommends

254
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,350
你打一剂强力的格雷戈针
a strong dosage of Gregitor.

255
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,620
这个梗你用过了
You already used that joke.

256
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,620
没有
No.

257
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,490
因为上回我说的是格雷戈嘧啶...
No, 'cause last time it was about Greg-acil...

258
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:14,390
也许你记得那是方便的胶囊型
which if you recall comes in convenient gel-tab form.

259
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:16,460
听着 我不想你来找我玩
Look, I don't want you hanging out with me.

260
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,090
我不需要你该死的同情
I don't need your stupid pity.

261
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:19,060
没关系 你走好了
It's fine, you can just go.

262
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,560
不是 不是
No, no.

263
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,160
你理解错了 我来这里不是因为我同情你
You got it all wrong. I'm not here 'cause I pity you.

264
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,630
而是因为我妈强迫我来
I'm actually here because my mom is making me.

265
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,700
那更糟
That's actually worse.

266
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,970
是的 我知道
Yeah, I know.

267
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:34,300
听着 我没事 真的没事 你就...走吧
Look, it's okay. Honestly, I'm fine. Just... just go.

268
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:36,640
好吧 瑞秋 你听我把话说完
Okay, Rachel, just listen to me for a second.

269
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:40,610
如果我不来找你玩...
My mom is gonna turn my life into a living hell...

270
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:43,080
那我妈会把我的生活变成人间地狱
if I don't hang out with you.

271
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,450
我完全没有夸张她的烦人程度
I can't overstate how annoying she's being about this.

272
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:49,120
她几乎是唠叨界的勒布朗·詹姆斯
She's basically like the LeBron James of nagging.

273
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,580
勒布朗·詹姆斯是打篮球的
LeBron James plays basketball.

274
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,830
我知道勒布朗·詹姆斯是谁
I know who LeBron James is.

275
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:58,290
听着 我知道我来这帮不了你
Look, I know I'm not doing you any favors here.

276
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:00,460
我来这是想请你帮我一个忙
What I'm asking is for you to do me a favor.

277
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,260
你想请我帮你一个忙?
You want a favor from me?

278
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,120
是的
Yes.

279
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,630
就让我和你一起玩一天吧
Just let me hang out with you for one day.

280
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,460
我就能向我妈交差了
I could tell my mom we hung out

281
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,760
之后我们就不再干涉彼此的生活
and then we'll just be out of each other's lives.

282
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,530
成交?
Deal?

283
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:14,630
成交
Deal.

284
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,130
保证
Word.

285
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,570
那是黑人权利敬礼吗?
Is that a Black Power salute?

286
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:21,340
不是 我只是想碰个拳
No, I was going in for a fist bump.

287
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,470
我站在这里碰不到你的拳头
I can't fist bump you from up here.

288
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,340
对 我意识到了
Yeah, I realize that.

289
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,150
书挺多
Books.

290
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,760
不错
Nice.

291
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:47,630
然后是...
And, uh...

292
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,630
树丛墙纸
tree wallpaper.

293
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,730
挺好的
That's good.

294
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,300
为什么好?
Why?

295
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,300
说不上来
I don't know.

296
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,300
友情在劫难逃 第一日

297
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,790
这房间里枕头好多
There's a lot of pillows in here.

298
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:29,660
唔
Mmm-hmm.

299
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,700
这里到底有... 有多少个枕头?
Seriously, like, how many... how many pillows is that?

300
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,170
我不知道
I don't know.

301
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,440
要是我也有这么多枕头就好了
I wish I had that many pillows.

302
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,210
那就问你爸妈要点
So, ask your parents for some.

303
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:44,540
不行 他们会怀疑我的
No, they'd be suspicious or something.

304
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,880
怀疑什么 你整天都在睡觉?
What, that you'd sleep all the time?

305
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,880
不 大概会怀疑
No. Probably assume

306
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,510
我在上面打飞机吧
I was gonna masturbate all over them.

307
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,820
他们总是把我想得很恶心
They just have some gross ideas about me.

308
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,820
但那是他们的想法
But that's on them.

309
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:59,420
他们买的都是性感的枕头
They're always getting sexy pillows.

310
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:02,720
这个枕头挺好看的
This is a nice pillow.

311
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,860
很明显它是公的...
This pillow is a dude, obviously...

312
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,390
但是它让我想起我家以前
but it reminds me of this pillow

313
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:07,290
有个叫弗朗西丝科的枕头
we used to have named Francesca.

314
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:08,830
和它颜色差不多
They have a similar coloring.

315
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,690
我们最后不得不把
Anyway, Francesca, we had to eventually

316
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,930
弗朗西丝科送人...
give away because in the end...

317
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:15,230
因为我们之间的感情成了问题
that whole situation was just a real problem.

318
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,830
一团糟
It was a mess.

319
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:19,270
没人能否认
There was a real chemistry

320
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:21,430
我们之间有种化学反应
between us both that I think no one could deny.

321
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,500
我知道世人都认为那是错的...
I know the world may have thought it was wrong...

322
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:27,340
但是我个人认为 世人才是错的...
but I think, personally, the world was wrong...

323
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,240
一个枕头和一个男孩...
about what could be between...

324
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,780
能产生怎样的情愫...
a pillow, and a boy...

325
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,340
而男孩自此成为男人
who became a man.

326
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,680
随便吧 我只是...
Or whatever. I'm just...

327
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,480
想搞笑一下
trying to be funny.

328
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:45,880
不 你说得很好玩 谢谢你
No, that was good. Thank you.

329
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,950
该死
Oh, shit.

330
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,330
厄尔: 你在哪呢 傻逼? 我要吃光你的鱿鱼了
我其实该走了
I actually have to go.

331
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,260
没事 是谁呀?
That's okay. Who was that?

332
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,730
抱歉 是厄尔
Sorry. Uh, that was Earl.

333
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:01,770
厄尔是谁?
Oh, who's Earl?

334
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,330
你也许记得15分钟前的那个厄尔
You may remember Earl from 15 minutes ago.

335
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,840
大咪咪
Titties.

336
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,770
有人以为厄尔是我的朋友
So, some people think Earl is my friend,

337
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:09,970
但他真的不是
but he's really not.

338
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,870
他更像是我的合作伙伴
He's more like a coworker.

339
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,510
从幼儿园起我就认识他了
I've known him since kindergarten.

340
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:15,880
他家离我家只有几步路
His house is a short walk from mine,

341
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,840
但是他家周围环境很差
but in a much tougher neighborhood.

342
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:21,310
他的爸爸在德州 他的妈妈有抑郁症
His dad is in Texas, his mom is a depressed shut-in.

343
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,350
而他哥哥德里克的狗 杜菲
And his brother Derrick's dog Doopie

344
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,350
总有一天会把我吃了
will definitely eat me someday.

345
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,890
杜菲 杜菲 冷静!
Doopie, Doopie, chill!

346
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:37,290
所以这么多年来 我们基本都是在我家玩
So over the years we've mostly hung out at my place.

347
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:40,560
一般和我爸爸一起玩 他是社会学终身教授
Usually with my dad, a tenured sociology professor.

348
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,800
小猫 你有什么能耐? 想打架吗?
What you got, cat? You wanna fight?

349
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,400
我猜你不敢吧 废废猫
Didn't think so, punk-ass cat.

350
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,270
- 孩子们!  - 他的工作让他可以
- Boys!  - His job allows him

351
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,770
经常无所事事地待在家
to be frequently at home doing nothing.

352
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,800
你们一定要来好好看看这个
You'll want to pay close attention to this.

353
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,810
疯狂的征服者 阿基尔
The insane conquistador, Aguirre,

354
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:55,470
正狂暴地穿过丛林...
is raging through the jungle...

355
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,040
去寻找并不存在的黄金之城
in search of a golden city that doesn't exist.

356
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,740
"上帝的愤怒"
"The Wrath of God."

357
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,480
经典的外国影片
It's a classic of foreign cinema.

358
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,980
"还有谁和我一起去?"
"Who else is with me?"

359
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:06,980
除了一流的电影...
In addition to the best films...

360
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,680
这是墨鱼
This is cuttlefish.

361
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:10,520
我家还有古怪之极的食物
my house also has the weirdest food.

362
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,520
一种貌似鱿鱼的海洋生物
A sea creature much like a squid.

363
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,060
是受人喜爱的东亚零食
It is a favorite East Asian snack food.

364
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,360
很明显 我们家庭背景相差悬殊
Obviously we come from pretty different backgrounds.

365
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,660
但不知为何 我们的喜好差不多
But somehow, we like most of the same things.

366
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,400
的确 它的气味在西方人闻起来
Yes, its smell is odd and repellent

367
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,860
又奇怪又恶心
to our Western noses.

368
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:26,370
而且 我们很早就意识到
And we learned pretty early on

369
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:27,830
我俩是唯一喜欢...
that we were the only ones who liked...

370
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,600
例如 经典外国电影的
for example, classics of foreign cinema.

371
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:33,840
为什么我们会喜欢?
Why did we like them?

372
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,840
很难说出原因
It's hard to say.

373
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,580
也许它们很奇怪 而且常充满暴力
Maybe it's that they were weird and often violent,

374
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,510
就像我们
like us.

375
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:42,010
有的很费解并且可能毫无意义 就像生活
Or confusing and possibly meaningless, like life.

376
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:44,650
"你不能逃出这个臭烘烘的营地
"You can't escape of this stinkin' camp

377
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:45,850
因为不知道他们何时会来电话
because you never know when they call you.

378
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:49,320
因为你拿了工资 签了合同"
Because you're paid for, you're under contract."

379
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,790
总之 我们太喜欢电影了
Anyway, we liked them so much

380
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:54,990
所以我们开始自己拍摄
we started making our own.

381
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,520
开拍!
Action!

382
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,390
每部电影的概念就是...
The idea behind each one was...

383
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:00,490
我们选一部喜欢的电影
we took a film that we liked

384
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,990
然后把电影名改得蠢一点
and made the title stupider.

385
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,560
再拍成新的电影
And then made a new film
"老民凯恩" "大开屁界" "罗斯玛丽的嫩萝卜" "四百基" "不死鼻鼬2" "扒又1/2的午饭" "粪人" "轰菱艳" "桃色汉堡" "迷踪记"

386
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,400
来反映这些蠢影名
to reflect the new stupid title.
"老民凯恩" "大开屁界" "罗斯玛丽的嫩萝卜" "四百基" "不死鼻鼬2" "扒又1/2的午饭" "粪人" "轰菱艳" "桃色汉堡" "迷踪记"

387
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,400
这拍摄套路只能产出烂片...
It's a formula that only produces horrible films...
"老民凯恩" "大开屁界" "罗斯玛丽的嫩萝卜" "四百基" "不死鼻鼬2" "扒又1/2的午饭" "粪人" "轰菱艳" "桃色汉堡" "迷踪记"

388
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,900
但是不知为何我们一直遵循着
but for some reason we keep using it.
"老民凯恩" "大开屁界" "罗斯玛丽的嫩萝卜" "四百基" "不死鼻鼬2" "扒又1/2的午饭" "粪人" "轰菱艳" "桃色汉堡" "迷踪记"

389
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,180
"老民凯恩" "大开屁界" "罗斯玛丽的嫩萝卜" "四百基" "不死鼻鼬2" "扒又1/2的午饭" "粪人" "轰菱艳" "桃色汉堡" "迷踪记"

390
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:10,290
"与巨型安德烈晚餐"(仿"与安德烈晚餐")
"老民凯恩" "大开屁界" "罗斯玛丽的嫩萝卜" "四百基" "不死鼻鼬2" "扒又1/2的午饭" "粪人" "轰菱艳" "桃色汉堡" "迷踪记"

391
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,520
"与巨型安德烈晚餐"(仿"与安德烈晚餐")

392
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:16,410

393
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:21,520
"少吸气"(仿"断了气")

394
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:26,080

395
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,970
"威尼斯疑魂之卧槽小丑杀人"(仿"威尼斯疑魂")

396
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:35,970
"封印七只海豹"(仿"第七封印")

397
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:40,420
"掏粪狂"(仿"偷窥狂")

398
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:45,850
"暴力胡同" 影评: 比"穷街陋巷"更为出彩!(仿"穷街陋巷")

399
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:53,110
"魂断球尼斯"(仿"魂断威尼斯")

400
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:55,510
我们制作了42部小电影
We've made 42 films.

401
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,080
也许你以为我们已经停止拍摄了
You'd think we'd have stopped making them by now.

402
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,980
但是并没有
But we haven't.

403
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,710
"尖叫的负担"(仿"梦想的负担")
"说实话你哪都去不了
"Honestly, it's like you can't go anywhere.

404
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:03,510
你不能逃出这个臭烘烘的地方...
You can't escape this stinking place...
"尖叫的负担"(仿"梦想的负担")

405
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,120
因为不知道他们何时会来电话...
because you don't know when they call you...

406
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,820
而且你签了合同拿了工资 这真是蠢话
'cause you are under contract and you're paid to be here, it's bullshit.

407
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,720
是的 就是这种感觉
Yeah, and it's like, you know,

408
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,890
我什么都做不了 我不是自由之身..."
I can't do anything. I'm not a free person..."

409
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:16,690
说实话 这是你们作品里我最喜欢的一部
Truly, one of my favorites from your oeuvre.

410
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:19,530
对暴力大自然成熟的研究
A mature investigation into the nature of violence.

411
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:21,830
老爸 我说了一万次了
Dad, for like the billionth time,

412
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,150
你不能看我们的电影
you're not allowed to watch these.

413
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,730
我是粉丝好嘛
I'm a fan.

414
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,570
你又要去见那个女孩了吗?
You gonna go see that girl again?

415
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,470
是啊 大概是的
I mean, probably, yeah.

416
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:34,910
你要玩她的咪咪吗?
You're gonna play with them titties?

417
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:37,640
不 不是那样的关系
No. It's not like that.

418
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,980
这就不对了
Well, that's not right.

419
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,610
这可能是她在世上最后一次有机会
I mean, this could be her last chance on Earth

420
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:41,940
和男人在一起
to be with a man.

421
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,410
别装作事不关己的样子
Don't make this about you.

422
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:44,410
厄尔!
Earl!

423
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:47,650
首先 她要是那么容易死
First of all, if it's that high-stakes,

424
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,650
我估计都不能勃起
probably won't even be able to get a boner.

425
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,650
我提到勃起了吗?
Did I even say shit about boners?

426
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,850
没有
No.

427
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,460
急性髓细胞白血病到底是个什么癌症?
What kind of cancer even is acute myelogenous leukemia?

428
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:01,830
就是癌症 呃...
You know, cancer of the, uh...

429
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,490
的一种
the thing.

430
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,100
"全是蠢话!"
"It's bullshit!"

431
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,170
安提耶坦之战是美国历史上
The Battle of Antietam was the bloodiest day

432
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:11,900
最血腥的一战
in American history.

433
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,970
同学们 你们有什么要说的?
Class, what do you have to say for yourselves?

434
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:15,970
尊重科研
Respect the research.

435
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,670
就是这样!
That is what I'm talking about!

436
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:21,470
好了 赶紧逃命吧
All right, run for your lives.

437
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,360
性命要紧 走吧 走吧
Save yourselves. Go, go, go, go, go.

438
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:25,980
干得漂亮 各位
Good work today, everybody.

439
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,810
巴姆 走吧 爱你 干得漂亮
Way to go. Bam. Love it. Good stuff.

440
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,750
干得好 今天表现很棒
Good job. Excellent work today.

441
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,680
- 很棒 干得漂亮  - 嘿 我可以和你谈谈吗?
- Excellent. Nice job.  - Hey, can I talk to you?

442
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,680
能耽误你几分钟吗?
Can I talk to you for a second?

443
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,750
当然 格雷戈 怎么了?
Sure, Greg, what's up?

444
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:39,220
呃 你知道什么是白血病吗?
Uh, do you know any facts about leukemia?

445
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,920
白血病?
Leukemia?

446
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,990
知道 这是一种血液和/或骨髓的癌症
Yeah, it's a cancer of the blood and/or bone marrow.

447
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,860
怎么了?
Why?

448
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,130
所以这种癌症是全身性的?
Right, so it's pretty spread out in the body?

449
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:50,960
是的 就是这样
That is a fact, yes.

450
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,600
人要是得了多久会死?
How soon do people die from it?

451
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,160
这种病治愈可能性很大 老兄
I think it's often pretty treatable, bud.

452
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,830
问这个干嘛?
Why do you ask?

453
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:59,770
你知道瑞秋·库什纳得了白血病吧?
Well, you know Rachel Kushner has leukemia, right?

454
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:00,870
等等 瑞秋得了什么?
Wait, Rachel has what?

455
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,800
我真是蠢出新高度了
I'm, like, innovatively stupid.

456
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:08,240
大家早晚会知道的
Everyone was gonna find out sooner or later.

457
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,580
只是不喜欢被迫跟人分享我的一切
Just hate having to share everything about myself.

458
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,820
我也是这样
I'm the exact same way.

459
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,640
你要是不想和人说话
You know, one thing you can do

460
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:15,910
你可以做件事...
if you don't want to talk to anyone...

461
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,790
那就是进入扭曲状态
is just enter a subhuman state.

462
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:22,150
像这样 你装成很烦的人
Here, pretend you're someone annoying.

463
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,760
"嗨 瑞秋
"Hi, Rachel.

464
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,200
听说你得了癌症我很难过"
I'm really sorry you have cancer."

465
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,040
这会有用吗?
Does that ever work?

466
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:51,040
当然 每次都有用
Yeah, of course. It works all the time.

467
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,280
这叫非暴力不合作
It's called passive resistance.

468
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,740
就是甘地使的那一招
You know, that's what Gandhi was all about.

469
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,870
甘地肯定没用过扭曲状态这招
I'm pretty sure Gandhi never did the subhuman thing.

470
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,320
他肯定有
Yeah he did .

471
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:03,680
这招让印度独立了呢 快试试
That's how India achieved statehood. Here, try it.

472
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,720
才不
Nope.

473
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,960
来吧 很简单的
Come on, it's easy.

474
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:15,090
好吧 你还可以做件事
Okay. Or another thing you can do is just

475
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,590
就是直接装死
flat-out pretend to be dead.

476
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,730
来烦我
Say something annoying to me.

477
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:20,730
嗯...
Um...

478
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,700
"嘿 瑞秋 希望你能记住
"Hey, Rachel. I just want you to remember

479
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,670
你的癌症是上帝的安排"
that your cancer is all part of God's plan."

480
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,040
嘿 混球
Hey, asshole.

481
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:36,380
对 看过来
Yeah, over here.

482
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:39,010
那我就直言不讳了
Just so we're straight on this,

483
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:40,710
你建议一个身患癌症的姑娘...
you're advising a girl with cancer...

484
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,720
去装死
to pretend to be dead.

485
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,350
不 说真的
No, seriously.

486
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:47,290
想想你在干嘛呢 傻逼
Think about what you're doing here, dickhead.

487
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:48,920
我忧郁的金刚狼脸
I've been doing my broody Wolverine face on

488
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,220
被贴在这姑娘的墙上...
this girl's wall...

489
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,060
已经五年零三个月了
for five and a quarter years,

490
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,360
而现在 我还贴在这里...
and at this point, I'm probably only still here...

491
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,990
多半因为她要是把我撕下来
because she'd feel weirdly guilty

492
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,690
会觉得愧疚和背叛了我
or disloyal taking me down.

493
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:58,290
但要是我让你这个蠢货
But I'm goddamned if I'm letting

494
00:22:58,290 --> 00:22:59,830
就这么大摇大摆进来胡说八道...
a little punk like you waltz in here...

495
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:01,130
那我就真该死了!
stupiding up the place!

496
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,360
我可看着你呢 老弟
Not on my watch, pal.

497
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,400
格雷戈 怎么了?
Greg, what's wrong?

498
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,200
真的很抱歉
I'm really sorry.

499
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,700
我不应该叫你去装死
I shouldn't have told you to pretend to be dead.

500
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,140
太没分寸了
That was really insensitive.

501
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,170
我是病了 又不是要死了
I mean, I'm sick. I'm not dying.

502
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:17,410
我知道 但是我...
Yeah, I know, but I just...

503
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:19,670
我觉得这样太奇怪了
Now I'm being all weird about it.

504
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,010
而且没法变得不奇怪 因为...
And I can't get un-weird, 'cause I just...

505
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:23,440
尽管你那么说
despite what you said,

506
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:25,280
但我还是坐在这想着...
I'm clearly still sitting here thinking...

507
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,640
"死亡 死亡 死亡 死亡"
"death, death, death, death, death, death."

508
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,930
我说的就是那样!
That's exactly what I'm talking about!

509
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,860
假如这是一个浪漫爱情故事...
So if this was a touching romantic story...

510
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,100
此刻我们应该会有一种全新的情感
this is probably where a new feeling

511
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,300
冲上头脑...
would wash over me...

512
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:52,700
然后彼此对望 突然间开始疯狂地亲热...
and our eyes would meet and suddenly we would be furiously making out...

513
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,660
干柴烈火
with the fire of a thousand suns.

514
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:01,070
但是这不是浪漫爱情故事
But this isn't a touching romantic story.

515
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,010
- 就这样...  - 对
- Anyway...  -Yep.

516
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:04,780
但是我们还是成为了朋友
But we did still become friends.

517
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:09,180
我和瑞秋成为真正的朋友篇

518
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:12,350
也即 没有回头之路

519
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,750
丹尼尔·克雷格的问题在于他有口音 对吗?
Daniel Craig's thing is, he's got an accent, right?
友情在劫难逃 第4日

520
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:17,490
所以他说话口型很奇怪...
So he's used to talking with his mouth in a weird shape...
友情在劫难逃 第4日

521
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,890
因此他有个翘嘴巴 像个女人
which is why he has pouty lips, like a woman.

522
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:22,760
友情在劫难逃 第7日
舔屏高科技 比如我可以把三明治用短信发给你
Lickable technology, like, I could text you a sandwich.

523
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:26,960
在他脖子后面的皮肤下有个按钮
There's a button on the nape of his neck, under the skin.

524
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:29,300
想要他闭嘴 就去按一下
Just push it if you want him to stop.

525
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,370
友情在劫难逃 第8日
你相信吗 有动物和我们住在一起
Do you believe animals just live in our house,

526
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:33,070
而家里人都没有意见?
and everyone's cool with it?
友情在劫难逃 第8日

527
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:33,970
而且是真的动物哦?
Like, real animals?
友情在劫难逃 第8日

528
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:34,970
而且是真的动物哦?
Like, real animals?

529
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:37,070
算了 该你说了
Anyway. You talk now.

530
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,910
你是说 谈癌症?
You mean, talk about cancer?

531
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:42,340
要是你想说就说吧
Only if you want to.

532
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,010
最难过的就是看着我妈
The hardest part is watching my mom

533
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:47,010
极力去处理这一切
trying to deal with it all.

534
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:48,750
有时候我会想 万一最后
And sometimes, I mean, I do think if it ends up

535
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:51,050
独留她一人在家...
that she's alone in that house...

536
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:52,780
她孤身一人了 她和我爸爸互相憎恨
She has no one. She and my dad hate each other.

537
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,280
她也没有兄弟姐妹
She has no siblings.

538
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:55,820
我不知道她能怎么办
I don't know what she'd do.

539
00:24:58,050 --> 00:24:59,420
不要哭
Don't cry.

540
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:02,020
我没有哭
I'm not crying.

541
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:04,230
好吧 你要是想哭就哭吧
Right, well, you know, you can cry if you need to.

542
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:05,950
你刚才说"不要哭"
I thought you said, "Don't cry."

543
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,430
我和我爸爸以前常在街区散步
Me and my dad used to walk around the block

544
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:12,970
然后数松鼠
and count squirrels.

545
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,900
为什么? 他是在松鼠普查中心工作吗?
Why? Did he work for, like, the squirrel census?

546
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,300
不 这只是我们在一起时
No, it was just something we did

547
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,540
没事做找乐子而已
when it was time for us to spend time together.

548
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,970
我们数松鼠的时候其它什么都不说
We didn't even say anything while we did it.

549
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:21,940
所说的不过是:
All we'd say was stuff like:

550
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:24,970
"七只松鼠" "过去两只 九只了"
"Squirrel, seven." "Two squirrels, nine."

551
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:28,780
天啊 你马上去申请爸爸赔偿金吧
Jesus. You need to apply for a dad refund immediately.

552
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:29,810
我是哪个派的?
What group am I in?

553
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:31,280
什么?
What?

554
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,980
昨天你告诉我 你把学校所有的学生
Yesterday you were saying you'd mapped out

555
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,110
都划分了派别
the entire high school by group.

556
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,520
我是哪个派别的?
What's my group?

557
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,850
- 你要听?  - 是啊
- Seriously?  - Yeah.

558
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:41,120
无聊犹太高三女生派 2-A班分支
Boring Jewish Senior Girls, Subgroup 2-A.

559
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:44,020
你该感谢我的坦诚
Please appreciate how honest I was just now.

560
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,020
你就是个混蛋
You're an asshole.

561
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:48,160
那你是哪个派的?
What group are you in?

562
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:51,330
呃 事实上 我没有派别
Uh, I'm not in a group, actually.

563
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:53,960
不烂的派我都高攀不起
I just wouldn't belong to a group that doesn't suck.

564
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:57,560
我差劲得要命
You know, I'm terminally awkward

565
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:59,300
而且长得像只土拨鼠
and I have a face like a little groundhog.

566
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,570
所以...
So...

567
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:02,270
你不会真这么想吧
You can't really think that.

568
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:04,970
不是我要那么想
No, I don't think that.

569
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:07,100
那就是事实
I know that.

570
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:10,210
我只是觉得 像我这样的孩子...
I just feel like, you know, for a kid like me...

571
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:14,910
在高中最好的情况
in high school, best case scenario,

572
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:16,580
不过是...存活下来 你懂吗?
just... survive. You know?

573
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:19,550
不去树敌或是做出让人记一辈子的蠢事...
Survive without creating any mortal enemies...

574
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:21,980
这样存活下来
or hideously embarrassing yourself forever.

575
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,420
存活到上大学?
Just survive until college?

576
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:27,220
大学? 不 天啊 大学更差劲
College? No. God, college is going to be even worse.

577
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,220
什么?
What?

578
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,960
我是说 至少高中三点就放学了...
I mean, at least high school, it's over at 3:00...

579
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,090
而且基本都是我认识的人
and it's kids I mostly know by now.

580
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:36,960
而大学里会不停遇见陌生人
But college is just gonna be non-stop strangers.

581
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,460
有的还要和你住在一起
And some of them even live in your room.

582
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,000
那就意味着你永远无法放松
It's like you can literally never relax.

583
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,260
可以预计不到两周 我就要恐慌至死
I see myself dying of a panic attack two weeks in.

584
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,270
我可能就不申请大学了
I might just not apply.

585
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,940
这是我听你说过最蠢的话
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard you say.

586
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,940
或许它还排不上前五蠢呢
It's probably not even top five.

587
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:55,110
而且 不管是高中还是大学
And, you know, high school, college,

588
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,410
我们不得不把人生这几年...
we're forced to spend these years of our lives...

589
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:58,440
和由不得我们选择
in randomly selected groups of people

590
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,180
又毫无共同点的人耗在一起
that we have nothing in common with.

591
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,410
想想就怕
It's a nightmare.

592
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:04,450
其实大家心里都是这么认为的
Anyone who says otherwise is lying.

593
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,350
恭喜你 格雷戈
Congratulations, Greg.

594
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,520
明天你要和无聊犹太高三女生派
Tomorrow, you're eating lunch with

595
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,050
2-A班分支共进午餐
boring Jewish Senior Girls, Subgroup 2-A.

596
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,160
你一般坐在哪儿?
So where do you usually sit?

597
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:21,220
咱们简直就像在阿富汗吃饭
It's literally like we're trying to have lunch in Kandahar.

598
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:28,200
瑞秋 我们刚知道今年舞会的主题竟然是
Rachel, we just found out the theme for this year's prom

599
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,170
"难忘佳骑"
"A Knight to Remember."

600
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:32,170
- 骑是"骑士"的骑  - 中世纪舞会!
- Knight with a "K".  - Medieval prom!

601
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:34,370
距离舞会不是还有六个月吗?
Isn't prom like six months away?

602
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:35,540
小伙伴们 这位是格雷戈
Hi, guys. This is Greg,

603
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:37,540
他今天和我们一起吃饭
he's gonna be sitting with us today.

604
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:40,070
谁要勺子? 没人吗?
Anybody need any spoons? No?

605
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:43,410
你们好
Hello.

606
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,510
格雷戈 为什么你今天会和我们坐一起?
So, Greg, why are you sitting with us today?

607
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,050
吃午饭嘛
You know, it's lunch.

608
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:53,280
总要找个地方坐 不能站着吧
You gotta eat somewhere. Can't stand and eat.

609
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:56,220
你和瑞秋突然成了好朋友
You and Rachel seem very friendly, all of a sudden.

610
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:58,420
是啊
Yeah.

611
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,990
你找她不过是因为她得了癌症
You're only talking to her because she has cancer.

612
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:01,420
什么?
What?

613
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,890
格雷戈 你和瑞秋就出去玩了一次
Greg, you hung out with Rachel once.

614
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,190
你和她交朋友只是想自我感觉良好
You're befriending her to feel good about yourself.

615
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:06,590
我没有
No, I'm not.

616
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,600
难道有人会那样做?
Who even does that?

617
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:12,460
你们介意我坐这儿吗?
You guys mind if I sit with you?

618
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:13,470
当然不介意
Of course not.

619
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,670
抱歉 这是一个...
Sorry, it's a...

620
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:19,340
这是一个枕头 用来扮演宝宝
it's a pillow. It's meant to be a baby,

621
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,170
健康课用的
for health class.

622
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:22,340
你觉得它在这安全吗?
You think it's safe here?

623
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,370
枕头吗?
A pillow?

624
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:25,730
格雷戈 你觉得呢?
Greg, what do you think?

625
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,940
我不知道
Mmm, I don't know.

626
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,310
最好不要让我碰到
Better not get it too close to me,

627
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:31,670
要不然我可能会拿它打飞机
otherwise I might just masturbate onto it.

628
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:34,770
格雷戈 你够恶心的
Greg, that's just weird and gross.

629
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:39,450
我恐慌又尴尬篇

630
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:39,770
嘿 大家
Hey, everyone,
我恐慌又尴尬篇

631
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:40,980
嘿 大家
Hey, everyone,

632
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:43,220
快看看斯考特·梅休的"霸王龙步伐"
check out Scott Mayhew's Tyrannosaurus walk.

633
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,420
从A点挪到B点 用这步伐最好不过
It's a great way to get from point A to point B.

634
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,290
格雷戈 你说话真刻薄
That was really mean, Greg.

635
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:48,520
我觉得他听见了
I think he heard you.

636
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,260
就这样...
And just like that...

637
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:01,000
八年来苦心经营的低调形象...
eight years of carefully-cultivated invisibility...

638
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,300
毁了
gone.

639
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,240
不复存在
Fin.

640
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,640
你妈妈做的饼干?
Your mom-made cookies?

641
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:11,340
不 是"病态菲尔"玩汤克牌输给我的
Nah, I won them off of Ill Phil in a game of tonk.

642
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:14,510
老是赢你没意思
Got tired of whooping your sorry ass.

643
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:17,050
真不知道为什么还有人叫它"学者视野生物学"
Why do they even call it Scholar Horizons Biology?

644
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:20,310
我觉得大家应该叫它"学者视野汤克牌"
Maybe they should call it Scholar Horizons Tonk.

645
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,820
或者叫"纸足球游戏"
Or sometimes Paper Football.

646
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,480
异教徒们
Heathens.

647
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:25,010
- 怎么了?  - 嗨 麦卡锡老师
- What up?  - Hi, Mr. McCarthy.

648
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:32,490
厄尔 你是在吃垃圾食品
Earl, fact, that lunch is garbage.

649
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:35,690
你这是在我们面前毒害自己
You're literally poisoning yourself right in front of us.

650
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,460
至少我不用喝那些恶心的
At least I ain't eating no funky ass

651
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:40,160
海藻一样的触须汤
seaweed-looking tentacle soup.

652
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:42,800
开玩笑 这东西可是宝
Seriously, this stuff is the business.

653
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,100
这是越南菜 叫越南河粉
It's Vietnamese. It's called Pho.

654
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,140
那是"芬芳馥郁"
It is "Pho-nomenal."

655
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,340
那让我来喝口试试
Well, let me try some one time.

656
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,500
- 你现在又想喝了?  - 是的
- Now you want to try some?  - Yeah.

657
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:54,270
不行
Well, no.

658
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:56,540
我不许给你食物
It's strictly forbidden for me to give you food.

659
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,670
不过你可以去...
However, if you go to...

660
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,780
劳伦斯维尔一家餐厅
Thuyen's Super Saigon Flavor

661
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,380
叫"于耶西贡好风味"...
over in Lawrenceville...

662
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,350
然后找于耶
and ask for Thuyen.

663
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:07,810
告诉他记我账上 就行了
Tell him to put it on my tab. You'll be all set.

664
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:13,290
我才不要去劳伦斯维尔
I ain't going to no damn Lawrenceville.

665
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:14,550
那当我没说
Fair enough.

666
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,520
抱歉 我要走了
You'll have to excuse me.

667
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,490
孩子们
Boys.

668
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:25,190
尊重科研
Respect the research.

669
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,200
要尊重!
Respect!

670
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:34,770
天啊 跟你说 大家都以为
God! You know, people just assume that

671
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:36,470
瑞秋和我在约会
Rachel and I are dating.

672
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:38,100
我的人生要毁了
It's ruining my life.

673
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,770
今天我还威胁要性侵一个假娃娃
Today I threatened to sexually assault a fake baby.

674
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:43,410
又和斯考特·梅休成了死敌
And I became mortal enemies with Scott Mayhew.

675
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:45,650
这些都是瑞秋的错
Both of which are Rachel's fault.

676
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,310
抱歉这么说 但确实如此
Sorry, but they just are.

677
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:51,210
当然 我这么抱怨很混账
Of course I'm a dick for complaining about it.

678
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:53,450
我是说 我这么抱怨真是太混账
I mean, I am a dick for complaining about it.

679
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:56,150
我其实不是真心这么想
I didn't actually mean any of that.

680
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:57,580
你还是去玩她们的咪咪吧
Better play with them titties.

681
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,000
你觉得味道奇怪吗?
Does this taste strange to you?

682
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,340
汤里有毒品
The soup had drugs.

683
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:14,050
我意外嗑药篇

684
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,350
麦卡锡一定在汤里加了大麻
McCarthy must've put weed in that soup

685
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:17,650
因为我的大脑现在一片混乱
because my brain is trying to eat itself.

686
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:19,290
天啊
Oh, my God.

687
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:20,650
我现在该去找瑞秋了
I have to go visit Rachel right now.

688
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:22,390
好 你去吧
Okay, well, you do that.

689
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:24,460
我去你家里 把你老爸的食物消灭干净
I'm gonna be at your house eatin' up all your dad's food.

690
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:26,290
不行! 你得来帮我!
No! You have to come help!

691
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:27,460
怎么帮?
Help with what?

692
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,460
帮我!
Help!

693
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,360
嘿 课堂上麦卡锡是不是表现得像
Hey, in class, do McCarthy act all, like,

694
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,630
磕嗨了?
stoned and shit?

695
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,500
我不知道 大概吧
Uh, I don't know. I guess.

696
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,930
偶尔吧
Yeah, sometimes.

697
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:40,830
不只是偶尔
Well, not sometimes,

698
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,330
你知道我... 你知道他这人
but you know what I'm... you know how he is.

699
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:44,400
该死的 小子
Goddamn, son.

700
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,500
你他妈整话都说不清了
You can't even put a full damn sentence together.

701
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:49,440
麦卡锡老师真是疯了才喝加毒品的汤
It's insane that Mr. McCarthy eats soup with drugs in it.

702
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,670
嘿 拜托了 老兄 说话小声点
Hey, come on, man, keep your damn voice down.

703
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:05,890
我们不能让人知道我们嗑药了
We can't tell anyone we're on drugs.

704
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:07,290
为什么不能?
Why the hell not?

705
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:11,460
因为这样别人就知道了
Because then they'll know.

706
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:33,580
我谦逊的小耗子又来了
It's my humble little mouse.

707
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,610
这只小耗子伙伴又是谁?
And who is his little mouse friend?

708
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:40,250
我叫厄尔·杰克森
Earl Jackson.

709
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:43,720
厄尔是我的合作伙伴 他这人很不错
Earl's just my coworker, and, uh, he's a great guy.

710
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,850
我们就是在这附近转悠
We were just walking around the neighborhood, you know.

711
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,690
也没什么事儿
Not really doing anything,

712
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:50,290
就是顺路过来打个招呼
and just wanted to come say "What's up?"

713
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:52,530
因为瑞秋就要剃光头了
'Cause Rachel's about to lose her hair.

714
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:53,990
我只是想说
Mmm. So, just wanted to say,

715
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,630
"掉了就掉了 没有了更好"
you know, "Bye, hair. Good riddance."

716
00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:00,330
她光头会更漂亮 那是事实...
She's gonna look great without hair. That's a fact, so...

717
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,300
对 我只是来打声招呼
Yeah, I just wanted to say what's up.

718
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:05,340
瑞秋! 有两只可爱的小耗子
Rachel! We've got two cute little mouse boys

719
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,220
在咱家门口想和你打招呼!
on our doorstep that wanna say hi!

720
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:14,610
小耗子们... 要来点奶酪吗?
Would you two... mice like a little bit of cheese?

721
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:19,800
好
Okay.

722
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:29,620
我喜欢你的房间 瑞秋
I like your room, Rachel.

723
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,920
谢谢 格雷戈觉得这儿过于女气了
Thanks. Greg thinks it's too girly.

724
00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:34,560
不 我喜欢女气 我觉得这样很好
No, I love girly, I think it's fine.

725
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,930
不是很女气啊
Well, it ain't too girly.

726
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:38,730
我见过有些房子是那样的 "哟 粉红蓬松的狗屎"
I mean, I've seen some room like "Yo, this some pink puffy bullshit."

727
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:40,460
比如把哈罗凯蒂
I mean, Hello Kitty posters

728
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:42,730
和古铜色裸男的海报贴满墙
and chocolate and naked dudes all over the wall.

729
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:44,870
真是看得我想吐
They make me want to throw up for real.

730
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:47,370
就算你要吐 也别吐在这好吗?
Hey, if you're gonna throw up, don't do it in here, okay?

731
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:48,370
这是她的房间
This is her room.

732
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,810
随便吧
Anyways.

733
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:54,130
瑞秋 我们就来看看你怎么样了
Rachel, we really just wanted to see how you was doin'.

734
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,910
谢谢
Thanks.

735
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:58,580
化疗 真的很糟糕
Yeah, chemotherapy. That really sucks.

736
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:59,580
格雷戈
Greg.

737
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:03,750
说什么鬼话呢 老兄? 别说它糟糕 蠢货!
What the hell, bro? Don't say it suck, dumb-ass!

738
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:05,780
化疗确实挺糟的
It does kinda suck.

739
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:07,690
话是这么说 可是你该做还是得去做
Yeah, but I mean, you gotta do what you gotta do.

740
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:08,820
大概是吧
Yeah, I guess.

741
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,430
听着 如果你们想走就走吧
Look, you guys can go if you want.

742
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:18,930
- 我们嗑药了  - 该死!
- We're on drugs.  - Oh, shit!

743
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:20,630
你们为什么嗑药?
Why are you on drugs?

744
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:22,000
好吧 我们是不小心嗑的药
Well, we're accidentally on drugs.

745
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,500
"不小心"?
"Accidentally"?

746
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,460
麦卡锡给了我们一点汤
McCarthy gave us some soup.

747
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:27,700
是麦卡锡分了我们一点他的
Well, McCarthy gave us some of his,

748
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,630
就是那种普通的正常的汤...
you know, just regular, normal soup...

749
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,700
可是结果那汤只剩一点
but then, it was the last of the soup.

750
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,800
所以我们就去餐馆...
So we had to go get some more...

751
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,870
再弄点来喝
from a restaurant,

752
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:35,640
餐馆在一栋办公楼5楼
on the fifth floor of an office building.

753
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,070
同一栋楼里
And in the same building,

754
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,440
还有牙买加大使馆...
there was a Jamaican Embassy...

755
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,980
结果我们和一个牙买加
And we ended up getting trapped

756
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,710
拉斯特法里教的人一起困在电梯里...
in an elevator with a Rastafarian guy...

757
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:45,510
他抽得整个电梯乌烟瘴气...
And he just hotboxed the whole elevator, so...

758
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:48,050
我们被困在那大概25分钟...
we were stuck in there for, like, 25 minutes...

759
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:48,980
被迫抽了难闻的大麻二手烟
And we had to breathe the weird marijuana air.

760
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,880
厄尔 是这样吧?
Earl, am I right?

761
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,080
真是完美的复述
That's exactly what happened.

762
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,790
你们还真经历了场冒险
You guys had quite an adventure.

763
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:58,420
嗑药的感觉真的很差
Being on drugs just really sucks.

764
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:00,390
是和嗑药的人在一起的感觉很差
Being around people on drugs sucks.

765
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:03,860
真抱歉 眼下这真是糟透了 抱歉
This whole situation, really sorry, just sucks. I'm sorry.

766
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:06,430
你他妈有毛病吧?
Yo, yo. What the hell is your problem, man?

767
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,900
道的这些歉和说的这些胡话
All apologetic and shit,

768
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,400
真他妈丢人
making shit 'bout your sorry ass.

769
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,500
听着 我们今天来这可不是搞这个的 好吗?
Look, that's not what we came here to do. Okay?

770
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,700
你要真想帮忙 就带她出去
You wanna help, you gonna take this girl out

771
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,070
吃点冰淇淋
to get some ice cream.

772
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:17,070
我也要吃 我爱死冰淇淋了
And me, too, 'cause I love that shit.

773
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,400
你喜欢吃冰淇淋吗?
You like ice cream?

774
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:20,070
喜欢
Yeah.

775
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:21,740
那你是上学的时候认识格雷戈的吗?
So, you know Greg from class?

776
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,080
我很小的时候就认识这家伙了
I've known Greg ever since we were little.

777
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,810
那时候才念幼儿园 对吧?
You know, I was in y'all kindergarten, right?

778
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:28,510
真的吗?
Really?

779
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:30,050
我记得你
Mmm-hmm. I remember you.

780
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:32,080
你就是那个管贾斯汀·琼斯叫变态的女孩...
You was the girl who called Justin Jones perverted...

781
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,520
因为他给女孩们展示他屁股上的胎记
for showing girls the birthmark on his butt.

782
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,520
天啊 没错!
Oh, my God, yes!

783
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,120
嗯 那小子跑过来
Yeah, dude came running up,

784
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,220
把屁股露给你看 你一脸淡定
showed you his butt. You were calm.

785
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,790
说"贾斯汀 只有变态才露屁股"
Said, "Justin, only perverts show their butts."

786
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:43,990
我当时在场
I was right there.

787
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:46,090
我真不敢相信你还记得
I can't believe you remember that.

788
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:49,200
你是个英雄 他再也不敢到处露屁股
You a hero. Shut his perverted ass right down.

789
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,600
我永远也忘不了
I never forget it.

790
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:53,730
你和格雷戈是合作伙伴?
So you and Greg are coworkers?

791
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,230
不 我们是朋友
Naw, we friends.

792
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,840
他就是不肯把别人称作"朋友" 这小子有毛病
He just hates calling people his friend. Dude's got issues.

793
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,610
对 确实有毛病 什么原因?
Yeah, he does. What's going on?

794
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:03,010
我也不懂 也许跟家人有关吧
Man, I don't even know. It might be his folks.

795
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:04,940
他老妈总告诉他
I mean, dude's mom always tellin' him

796
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:07,080
他长得有多帅 但其实他不帅
how handsome he is, which he ain't.

797
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,780
以至于他现在都不肯信任身边的人
So now he think he can't trust anybody close to him.

798
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,210
还有他那个奇怪的老爹
Dude's weird-ass dad

799
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,680
和什么人都不亲近 除了一只猫
don't socialize with anybody 'cept the cat.

800
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,150
所以那个榜样老爹一个朋友也没有
So that's a role model ain't got no friends.

801
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,920
结果就是 这小子特别怕
Bottom line, dude's terrified

802
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,920
称别人为朋友...
of callin' somebody his friend...

803
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,120
要是有人说"嘿 老兄 我不是你的朋友"
And they sayin', "Hey, bro, I'm not your friend."

804
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:23,620
他就得去自杀了
Then he'd have to kill himself.

805
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:25,590
不过你们怎么叫合作伙伴?
But how are you coworkers?

806
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:27,930
我们一起拍电影
We, um, we make films.

807
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:30,030
电影?
Movies?

808
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:32,800
对 我们一起拍电影有几年了
Yeah. We been making them for a few years now.

809
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,670
一共拍了大约42部
We have, like, 42 in total.

810
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:37,070
格雷戈! 你从没和我说过
Greg! You never told me.

811
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:38,600
我们从未告诉任何人
Well, we never told anybody 'bout them.

812
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,600
都是烂片 我是说 烂到爆
They suck. I mean, they're terrible.

813
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:42,810
我敢肯定那些电影不烂
I'm pretty sure they don't suck.

814
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:44,730
要是你愿意 你可以自己去看看烂不烂
Well, you can see for yourself if you want.

815
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:46,610
你确定吗?
Are you sure?

816
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:47,610
当然了 没什么好担心的
Hell, yeah, don't even worry about it.

817
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:48,780
就是别告诉别人
Just don't tell nobody.

818
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:49,860
当然 我不会告诉别人的
No, of course, I won't.

819
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:52,910
好了 小子 站起来吧
All right, son, get on your feet.

820
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:53,910
好主意
Sounds good.

821
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,050
我们要去哪儿?
Where are we going?

822
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:03,050
大卫·林奇(未出演) "丝绒酒" 充满异域风情的饮品... 满含寓言之梦（仿"蓝丝绒"）

823
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:16,140
原来厄尔什么都不在乎篇

824
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:25,140
我们可以送你回家
We can walk you home.

825
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,570
他还没恢复过来
He needs to recover,

826
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,490
你还是照看好他吧
and you probably should look after him.

827
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,040
一路平安
Peace, peace.

828
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,880
- 谢谢  - 再见
- Thanks.  - Bye.

829
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,840
该死 厄尔
Goddamn it, Earl.

830
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:39,650
小子 别跟我来这套
Son, don't even start.

831
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:40,850
猪蹄
Pig's foot.

832
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:48,620
随着我们这个愚蠢故事的深入...
So, we're pretty far into this stupid story now...

833
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,920
你可能会告诉自己
and you're probably saying to yourself,

834
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,890
"嘿 我喜欢这个叫瑞秋的女孩
"Hey. I like this girl Rachel.

835
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:55,660
如果她最后去世了 我会很郁闷的"
And I'm gonna be pissed if she dies at the end."

836
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:58,690
所以我想告诉你 别担心 她活下来了
So I am just telling you. Don't freak out. She survives.

837
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:01,930
希望这样能让你安心
So, hopefully, that reassures you.

838
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:06,130
虽然这又怎么会有用呢?
Although, actually, why would it?

839
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:09,270
你们今天的热情真叫我感慨
I'm just overwhelmed with your enthusiasm today.

840
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:10,740
我猜我们得用
I guess we're just gonna have to do it

841
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,240
最古老的方法来解决了
the old-fashioned way.

842
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:14,870
我脑子里已经有了一个人
I'm thinking of one of you.

843
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,270
在这我就不提他的名字了
I'm not gonna mention any names,

844
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,110
不过你的名字缩写...
but your initials...

845
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:19,840
是斯考特·马修
are Scott Mayhew.

846
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:21,880
其实格雷戈告诉大家
In fact, Greg's been telling everyone

847
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,350
你的汤里有大麻
your soup has marijuana in it.

848
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:25,220
我没有告诉任何人
I didn't tell anyone.

849
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,820
我在公交车上听见你喊了
I heard you bellowing about it on public transit.

850
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,320
是事实吗 格雷戈?
Is that a fact, Greg?

851
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:34,160
听着 昨天厄尔和我不知怎么就嗨了
Look, yesterday, Earl and I got stoned somehow.

852
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,020
就是在喝过你的汤之后
And it was after we both ate your soup.

853
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:37,260
而我们并没有抽大麻
And we didn't smoke any marijuana,

854
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,090
我也从来没抽过 所以...
which I have never done, so...

855
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,390
你的汤里一定有大麻
your soup must have drugs in it,

856
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,060
因为我们吃过的食物就只有汤...
'cause that was the only thing we both ate...

857
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,660
还有从毒贩子"病态菲尔"那
other than some cookies we got from Ill Phil,

858
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:44,960
拿的饼干
the drug dealer.

859
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:51,270
老兄 你怎么会不知道是饼干的原因?
Man, how did you not know it was the cookies?

860
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:54,210
老兄 是你这笨蛋在车上大吼大叫的
Man, it was your dumb ass yelling that shit on the bus.

861
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:55,770
哟 格雷戈!
Yo, Greg!

862
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,370
你打我的小报告了?
Did you snitch on me?

863
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,810
他当然打了!
He did snitch on you!

864
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,980
我就在场
I was there.

865
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,940
我听见你嘲笑我
I heard you ridiculing me

866
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:04,310
就当着你那些恶心的闺蜜的面
in front of your loathsome harem.

867
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:08,250
你让自己... 多了一个死敌
You have made... a mortal enemy.

868
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:10,250
我永远都不会放过你
And I will never stop hounding you.

869
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:12,680
没错 而且你的死敌是两个 老子可捅过人的
Yeah, you made two mortal enemies. I stabbed a dude.

870
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:14,150
老天啊
Jesus.

871
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:16,150
我会用20招干掉你
I'll kiil you in 20 different ways

872
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:18,850
用刀捅死你 拿死光射死你
Stab you with blades. Shoot you with death rays.

873
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:21,850
把你丢在迷宫里 拿蛋黄酱噎死你
Abandon you in a maze. Choke you on mayonnaise

874
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:35,080
瑞秋化疗数周篇

875
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:40,880
我能说些什么呢?

876
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:48,780
所以他们还没真的动我
So they haven't really done anything.

877
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,980
过去快一个月了
It's been about a month now.

878
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,720
他们确实说永远不会放过我...
They did say they're never gonna stop hounding me...

879
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,250
所以也就是迟早的事吧...
so, sooner or later... you know...

880
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,990
迟早被他们抓到
gonna get hounded.

881
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:03,890
对不起 下次我会带些花来
Sorry, next time I'll bring you some flowers.

882
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:07,230
不过我都不知道能放在哪里
Though I don't even know where I'd put them.

883
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:10,070
几乎只有呕吐筐还是空的
It's like, like the only place left is the barf bucket.

884
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:14,000
鲜花
Flowers.

885
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,140
你呕吐的地方
Where you barf.

886
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,810
我喜欢你头上的帽子
I like that hat.

887
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:27,840
蛮可爱的
It's pretty cute.

888
00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:37,020
听着 我从小就不是特别漂亮...
Look, I've never been very beautiful...

889
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:40,020
那也没关系 因为我不看重外貌
and that's fine because that's not important to me.

890
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:42,090
但是...
But...

891
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,560
我本以为接受我现在的样子没那么难
I thought it'd be easier looking like this.

892
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,490
但并非如此
It's just not.

893
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:53,300
大家来看到我这样...
Everyone comes in here and sees me...

894
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:55,770
明显能看出他们的厌恶
and they're so clearly repulsed.

895
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:59,170
真的比我想象的难多了
It's so much harder than I thought it would be.

896
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,170
嘿 别这么说
Hey, come on.

897
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:02,800
你很漂亮
You look good.

898
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:07,070
我很丑 格雷戈! 真的很丑
I'm ugly, Greg! I'm so ugly.

899
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:09,040
每个人都觉得应该对我说好话
Everyone feels like they have to lie to me

900
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,740
而没人意识到那更伤人
and no one realizes how insulting that is.

901
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:13,940
大家都觉得是在帮我 其实并非如此
Everyone thinks they're helping, and they're not.

902
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:30,490
拿着
Here.

903
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:33,190
这片子叫"罗生疹"
That one's called Mono Rash.

904
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,430
根据黑泽明的"罗生门"拍的
It's based on Rashomon by Kurosawa.

905
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:36,860
故事讲的是厄尔一直在杀人
Plot's basically just Earl killing people

906
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:38,260
因为他长了疹子...
'cause he has a rash...

907
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:40,550
病因是单核细胞增多症
from mono, you know, the STD.

908
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:45,370
不管怎样 我们就要制作新片了
Anyway, we're supposed to go work on

909
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:47,800
致敬"现代启示录"
our homage to Apocalypse Now.

910
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:49,870
我们的叫"一盒郁金香 哇"
Ours is called A Box O' Lips, Wow,

911
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:51,750
肯定比"罗生疹"还逊
which is even worse than Mono Rash.

912
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:54,270
它是一部战争片 讲的是两个人
It's a war movie where these two guys

913
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,940
卷入了残酷得难以形容的战争...
take part in the unspeakable brutality of war...

914
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:58,210
然后他们找到了一盒郁金香
and then they find a box of tulips.

915
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:00,450
"一盒郁金香" 然后他俩就"哇"地大叫
Box O' Lips, yeah. And they're just, "Wow."

916
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:02,510
郁金香的美丽让他们难以忘却
They can't get over how great these tulips are,

917
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,560
就像这样叫"一盒郁金香 哇!"
it's like, "A box o' lips, wow!"

918
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,520
不过最惨的是郁金香太贵了
The worst part is, tulips might not

919
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,420
完全超出了我们的预算
even be in the budget anymore.

920
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:11,890
我还是在这儿呆着吧
I should actually just stay here

921
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:13,130
不能让你看我们拍的烂片
and keep you from watching that.

922
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:16,020
没关系 你去拍吧
No! I'm fine. Go make it.

923
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:17,220
好吧
Okay.

924
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:21,490
好吧 那祝你尽情享受
Okay. Have fun watching

925
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:23,430
这部史无前例的烂片
this incredibly terrible movie.

926
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:26,530
嗯 祝你新作顺利
Mmm. Have fun making the next one.

927
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:27,570
唔
Mmm-hmm.

928
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:52,120
嘿 白人小子!
Hey, white boy!

929
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,650
给我做一朵郁金香 不然我就
Why don't you make me a tulip 'fore I have Doopie come down

930
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:55,560
放杜菲下来咬你
there and eat your face.

931
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:58,490
不过 说真的 你能帮我做一朵郁金香吗?
But no, for real. Can you make me a tulip?

932
00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:00,230
天啊 我真的在片场吗?
Oh, my God! Am I on set right now?

933
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:01,590
- 我去!  - 天啊!
- Oh, damn!  - Oh, my God!

934
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:04,300
啊! 我好激动! 开机! 停机!
Ahh! I can't take it! Action! Cut!

935
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:08,030
麦迪森 你来这干嘛?
Madison, why are you here?

936
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:09,500
瑞秋说我能在这儿找到你...
Rachel said that I could find you here...

937
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,370
你的电话又直接转语音信箱了
and your phone was going straight to voice mail.

938
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:13,540
多半因为这里没有信号!
Probably 'cause there ain't no good service down there!

939
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:15,540
但我想来跟你说个事
But I had to get here 'cause I had to let you know.

940
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:18,210
我去看望瑞秋 送她慰问卡...
So, I was visiting Rachel, and I was giving her a card...

941
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:20,540
然后她正在看你们的秘密电影
and she was watching one of your secret movies.

942
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:22,140
天啊 你不会也看了吧?
Oh, my God. Wait, did you see any of it?

943
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:23,510
没有! 我一进去她就关了
No! No, she turned it off immediately.

944
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:25,150
拍得挺好的 真的
It was good, it was good.

945
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:26,380
你们两个都扮演日本人...
You know, you're both Japanese, and...

946
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:28,050
厄尔将你斩首 就看到这
Earl beheaded you, and, but then,

947
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:29,720
她就把电影关了
she, like, turned it off.

948
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:32,250
但是我有个想法 有一个很赞的想法
But I had a brainstorm. Okay? I had an amazing brainstorm.

949
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:35,850
我觉得...你得为瑞秋拍部片子
I realized... you need to make a film for Rachel.

950
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,360
你怎么想?
What do you think?

951
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,290
肯定会成为她的心头最爱...
It would be like her favorite thing in the entire world...

952
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:43,450
也会是你能做的最重要的事
and it's like the most important thing you could do.

953
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:45,230
你一定得答应
You have to do it.

954
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:50,600
好吧 考虑下
Yeah, word.

955
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,700
"考虑下"? 意思是你同意了?
"Word"? Like, word, you'll do it, word?

956
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:02,010
是的
Yep.

957
00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:03,240
天啊 太好了!
Oh, my God, awesome!

958
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,710
那什么 我迫不及待想看你的成片了
Okay, well, I can't wait to see it.

959
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:06,050
好了 我得走了 不过...
Um, okay, I gotta go, but...

960
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:08,700
停机!
Cut!

961
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:09,780
我胡说的!
That's a wrap!

962
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:11,210
继续拍!
Rolling!

963
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:13,810
大咪咪
Titties.

964
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:15,080
妈的!
Goddamn it!

965
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:17,250
接下来的几周
In the next few weeks,

966
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:19,450
我开始拍摄那部片子了吗? 并没有
did I start making that movie? No.

967
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:21,380
因为我并没答应拍这部片
Because I didn't agree to make that movie.

968
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:23,520
我只是说"考虑下"
All I said was, "Word."

969
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,520
"考虑"也可以是什么意义都没有
"Word" could mean anything.

970
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:26,990
而且至少还有一两个月
Plus, we had at least a month or two...

971
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:30,430
瑞秋才能看完我们拍过的烂片
before she'd ran through all the terrible films we'd already made.

972
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:33,290
比如"袜条橙子"
For example, A Sockwork Orange.

973
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:45,290
"袜条橙子"

974
00:45:58,520 --> 00:45:59,620
"古歌"?
"Droogle"?

975
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:02,790
是古惑仔用的谷歌
It's Google for droogs.

976
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:06,160
那是什么?
What's that?

977
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,950
没什么 只是我的一块心病
Nothing, just the bane of my existence.

978
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:11,330
我妈妈逼我一直带着这本书
Which my mom is forcing me to carry around

979
00:46:11,330 --> 00:46:13,630
除非我开始申请大学
until I apply to some colleges.

980
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,130
她说这像份菜单
She says it's like a menu

981
00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:17,200
写满我的未来 我想说"是啊
for my future, and I was, like, "Sure.

982
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,330
里面的菜品只会
A menu that only has food

983
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:21,570
在接下来四年里给我带来羞辱"
that will humiliate me for four years."

984
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:25,340
在上大学的问题上 你能不能别那么傻
You have to be less of an idiot about college.

985
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:27,570
听着 如果你觉得大家不会喜欢你...
Listen, even if you think people won't like you...

986
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:30,680
当然这个想法本身就很荒唐...
which is literally an insane thing to think...

987
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,480
你在大学里曝光要少多了
you're way less exposed to people in college.

988
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,250
高中一周40小时课
High school is 40 hours of class a week.

989
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:38,210
在大学里就只有15到20小时
College is, like, 15 and 20.

990
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:39,350
如果你不想与人合住
And if you don't want to live with other people,

991
00:46:39,350 --> 00:46:41,650
可以去匹兹堡州立大学
then go to Pittsburgh State.

992
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:43,720
可以住家里
Live at home.

993
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:46,590
总好过放弃大学
It's better than sitting college out

994
00:46:46,590 --> 00:46:49,110
就为了你莫名的自我厌恶吧
because you irrationally hate yourself.

995
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:50,520
不是没有原因的
Not irrationally, though.

996
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:51,990
申请匹兹堡州立大学吧
Apply to Pittsburgh State.

997
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:56,230
现在就申请 早点申请
Right now. Apply early.

998
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:59,200
来 当着我的面申请匹兹堡州立
Come on. Do it in front of me. Apply to Pittsburgh State.

999
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,740
我要是说不呢?
What if I say no?

1000
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:04,270
我癌症四期了
I have stage four cancer.

1001
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,570
所以你要是拒绝的话 你就是个混蛋
So that would be a pretty dick move. Come on.

1002
00:47:08,570 --> 00:47:09,570
好吧
Fine.

1003
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:22,480
"为什么我想... 上大学
"Why I want to go... to college.

1004
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:26,680
申请人 韦纳·荷索("陆上行舟"导演)
By Werner Herzog.

1005
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:29,650
入学条件苛刻的
The highly selective

1006
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:31,550
招生过程...
admissions process...

1007
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:34,560
筛掉了残忍和愚蠢的学生
weeds out the cruel and the stupid.

1008
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:38,130
所以大学并不像高中一样...
So college is unlike the senseless chaos...

1009
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:41,700
充斥着混乱无序和病态罪行
and sickening enormity of high school.

1010
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:45,130
高中就像恶魔的嘴巴...
High school is the mouth of a great demon...

1011
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:46,870
撕咬和咀嚼
biting and chewing

1012
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:48,300
将人们折磨得体无完肤
and smushing people in the face.

1013
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:52,300
令人无法反抗
It is simply overwhelming.

1014
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:57,810
严肃地说
In all seriousness,

1015
00:47:57,810 --> 00:47:59,780
我很期待大学生活...
I am looking forward to college...

1016
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:02,550
因为我很不适应高中的环境
because I didn't really fit in in high school,

1017
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:03,380
因为我长得像一只耗子..."
because of my weird rodent face..."

1018
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,880
才没有
No.

1019
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,650
"还有说蠢话的习惯"
"and a habit of saying the dumbest possible shit."

1020
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:09,280
胡说!
No!

1021
00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:12,350
"我那发青的面色...
"The sheer pastiness of my complexion...

1022
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:16,490
让人看了就想吐"
overwhelms all who behold it with existential nausea."

1023
00:48:16,490 --> 00:48:20,760
"在高中 我内心深处从未...
"In high school, I never truly felt comfortable...

1024
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:23,160
真正感到舒适
in my own skin.

1025
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:25,260
事实上 我是那种...
In fact, I've always been someone...

1026
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:29,800
并不真心喜爱自己的人
who doesn't really like themselves.

1027
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:33,900
但那是因为我自认还有成长的空间...
But I think that's because I have some growing up to do...

1028
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:38,770
而大学正为我提供了这样一个舞台"
and college is the place where I'm going to do it."

1029
00:48:41,310 --> 00:48:42,610
这也太私人了吧
That's way too personal.

1030
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:44,610
本来就是个人申请书啊
It's personal essay.

1031
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:48,250
行 你是不是还想看这个...
Fine, if you want to see this again...

1032
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:49,980
好吧! 服了你!
Okay! Okay!

1033
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:53,120
但只是因为你得了癌症
But only because cancer.

1034
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:56,720
你猜怎么着? 你也得跟我一样去申请大学
And you know what? You have to do this too now. Here.

1035
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,420
翻翻这部可怕的大厚书
Page through this huge, horrible book

1036
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:00,690
找到你心仪的大学
and find some colleges.

1037
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:02,430
这部书归你了
That's yours now.

1038
00:49:03,330 --> 00:49:05,810
唔 就像是写满你未来的菜单
Mmm. It's like a menu for your future.

1039
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:12,530
我能先看完电影吗?
Can I finish my movie first?

如果我们拍了这部电影
So, if we make this film,

1068
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:35,840
大家会像这样:
people are gonna be, like:

1069
00:51:36,290 --> 00:51:37,520
"哦 格雷戈和厄尔
"Oh, Greg and Earl,

1070
00:51:37,530 --> 00:51:39,320
他们就是那俩拍电影的怪人
they're those weird filmmakers.

1071
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:41,060
总是神经兮兮地乱拍
They're always creepily filming stuff.

1072
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:42,660
也许有天晚上他们会溜进你家
They'll probably sneak into your house one night

1073
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:44,030
拍你睡觉的样子"
and film you while you're sleeping."

1074
00:51:44,030 --> 00:51:45,530
但是大家可能已经这么想了
But people probably already think that,

1075
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:47,470
- 都怪你给瑞秋看那些蠢片子  - 这真难吃
- 'cause you gave Rachel those stupid films.  - This is nasty as hell.

1076
00:51:47,530 --> 00:51:49,030
现在我变得那么多疑
So now, I've become completely conspicuous,

1077
00:51:49,030 --> 00:51:50,600
整天乱想
like all the time.

1078
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:53,300
大家看着我会想"拍电影的"
People look at me and think, "Filmmaker."

1079
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:54,300
要不然就是这么想...
When they're not already thinking...

1080
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:55,540
- "那个癌症女的男朋友"  - 这是什么玩意儿?
- "Cancer girl's boyfriend." - The hell even is this?

1081
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:56,800
味道就像臭狗屎一样
It tastes like a dog's funky-ass butthole.

1082
00:51:56,810 --> 00:51:58,410
还有 我们答应拍的那部片子
Furthermore, we agreed to do a film

1083
00:51:58,410 --> 00:51:59,840
该拍成什么样 一点概念也没有...
that we have no idea what it should look like...

1084
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,840
该怎么说 怎么拍
or sound like, or even be.

1085
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:02,940
我是说 我们连拍什么类型的
I mean, what the hell sort of film

1086
00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:05,110
都不知道 怎么拍?
should we even make? Huh?

1087
00:52:05,110 --> 00:52:07,110
我当时怎么想的?
I mean, what was I thinking?

1088
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:08,110
你在想那个美女麦迪森
You were thinking that girl Madison

1089
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,620
咪咪不错
had nice titties.

1090
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:10,820
我想说 我也喜欢大胸妹
I mean, I like the titties too,

1091
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:12,680
但是该烦恼的是你
but now you got a problem.

1092
00:52:12,690 --> 00:52:13,950
因为我压根就没有同意
'Cause I ain't agreed to do this shit.

1093
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:14,950
是你同意的
You did.

1094
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:18,920
你不想来帮我拍吗?
Are you not gonna help me make this?

1095
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,960
我们拍什么啊 兄弟?
The hell we gonna make, son?

1096
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,560
他们需要新鲜的灵感
They want fresh inspiration.

1097
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:24,930
我得跟你说 我得到过的
I must tell you, the richest inspiration

1098
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:27,030
最丰富的灵感...
I have ever known was...

1099
00:52:27,030 --> 00:52:29,530
来自于我在亚马逊与世隔绝的日子
during my period of quarantine in the Amazon.

1100
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:32,570
当时 我和其他六七个人...
Where I and a half dozen other...

1101
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:34,900
视线所及之处全是...
unfortunates had nothing to watch...

1102
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:38,800
浑身是毛体型巨大的狼蛛...
but the bristling, leviathan tarantula...

1103
00:52:38,810 --> 00:52:41,970
爬满腐烂破败的茅草屋...
bunched up on the rotting, flimsy thatch...

1104
00:52:41,970 --> 00:52:43,850
离我们的脸大概只有20厘米
perhaps eight feet above our faces.

1105
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:47,610
蜘蛛有拳头那么大
Spiders the size of your fist.

1106
00:52:47,610 --> 00:52:50,080
它们尖牙上的毒液闪闪发光...
Their fangs glistening with venom and...

1107
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:51,880
数千只黑色的复眼
their thousand-fold black eyes

1108
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:54,180
在黑暗中眼神呆滞
shining dully in the gloom.

1109
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:55,650
在黑暗中你会听见
In the darkness, you would hear

1110
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:57,650
突如其来的嘶嘶声...
the sudden anguished hiss...

1111
00:52:57,650 --> 00:53:00,590
那是一只蜘蛛正被成年豹蜂攻击...
of a spider being struck by an adult leopard wasp...

1112
00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:01,890
它们垂死挣扎时
and in their mortal struggle,

1113
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:03,190
会跌落到某人的床上...
they would plummet to one's bed...

1114
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:05,820
各种咬啊 叮啊 打啊...
biting and stinging and thrashing...

1115
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:09,630
你知道黄蜂也可以熏着吃吗?
You know that you can smoke a hornet?

1116
00:53:11,530 --> 00:53:13,830
这样 你回答问题的时候看着我就好了
Okay, so just look at me when you answer the questions.

1117
00:53:13,830 --> 00:53:15,630
不要管镜头 好吗?
Don't worry about the camera, all right?

1118
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:18,900
好的 蒂尼斯
Okay, Denise.

1119
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:21,180
跟我讲讲瑞秋出生的情形吧
Tell me a little about Rachel's birth.

1120
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:22,970
嗯 瑞秋的出生
Uh, Rachel's birth.

1121
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:26,170
那是多么那难熬的经历啊
What an ordeal that was.

1122
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:30,210
格雷戈 我就... 跟你说一件事
Greg, just... let me tell you one thing.

1123
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:33,210
我真的是一个好母亲 知道吗?
I was a really good mom to her, you know?

1124
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:35,480
真的
I really was.

1125
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,880
有些单身母亲 她们的孩子过早地成熟...
Some single moms, their kids grow up too fast...

1126
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:39,650
而我总是极力避免让瑞秋早熟
but I always tried to protect Rachel from that.

1127
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:41,970
我尽了最大的努力
I did my very best to protect her from...

1128
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:45,620
让她成长得慢一些 明白吗?
growing up too quickly, you know?

1129
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:48,690
明白
Right.

1130
00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:50,560
但是现在 我懂得有些事情...
And now, I'm learning that there are...

1131
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:55,530
是你根本保护不了孩子的 你知道吗?
protect your kid from, you know?

1132
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:59,300
不管你做什么 你就是不能...
No matter what you do, you just...

1133
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:09,600
那 她有什么喜欢的玩具吗?
So, did she have any favorite toys?

1134
00:54:09,610 --> 00:54:11,610
在回答这个问题之前 这话是认真的...
Before I answer that question, this is serious...

1135
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:15,640
所以你得给我好好听着
so use your ears and listen to me.

1136
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:18,510
我希望你能保证一件事
I want you to promise me something

1137
00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:20,110
因为我很关心你
as I care about you.

1138
00:54:20,110 --> 00:54:21,780
你得向我保证 在你找到真爱之前...
You gotta promise me you're not gonna have a baby...

1139
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:22,980
千万别生孩子
unless you're ready to love

1140
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:24,180
除非你能爱她一辈子...
that baby's mother your whole life...

1141
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:25,820
我是认真的
and this is serious.

1142
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:29,080
其他人不会像我这样告诉你
I'm telling you something that nobody's gonna tell you.

1143
00:54:29,090 --> 00:54:32,590
不要找那些若即若离的女孩 听见没?
Don't pick a girl who's push-pull, you know?

1144
00:54:32,590 --> 00:54:35,070
你得找一个全心全意爱你的...
You wanna pick somebody who's gonna love you...

1145
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:38,530
永远不会忘记你的...
and not forget you, and not...

1146
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:40,960
不会为了某个大屁股贱人抛弃你的
leave you for someone with a big, fat ass.

1147
00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:43,600
这么说她没有最喜欢的玩具
So, no favorite toy.

1148
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,060
嗯...
Um...

1149
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:48,230
哦 你想知道的话 这里有一个
Oh, you want to know what? Here's a favorite toy.

1150
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:49,770
剪刀
Scissors.

1151
00:54:49,770 --> 00:54:51,770
瑞秋的爸爸先离开的时候...
When Rachel's father first left...

1152
00:54:51,770 --> 00:54:53,140
她收集了他所有的书
she gathered up all his books,

1153
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:57,170
把它们捆在一起 然后把它们都剪了
and she rounded 'em up and she cut them right up.

1154
00:54:57,170 --> 00:54:58,210
千万别跟她说是我告诉你的
Please, don't tell her I'm telling you,

1155
00:54:58,210 --> 00:54:59,910
她会杀了我
she would chop my head off.

1156
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:02,680
但她就这么...
But she just...

1157
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:04,710
我当时想 "干得好 闺女"
And I was, like, "Atta girl."

1158
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:08,050
喀嚓 喀嚓 喀嚓 她当时很生气
Snip, snip, snip. She was very mad.

1159
00:55:08,050 --> 00:55:10,550
我们能不能休息一下 喝点小酒?
Can we take a little break and have a little taste?

1160
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:12,050
你们应该到了可以喝酒的年纪吧?
You boys are old enough to have a little taste, right?

1161
00:55:12,050 --> 00:55:14,170
我们就休息一小会 喝点小酒吧?
Can we take a teeny break, just have a little taste?

1162
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,660
好的 好孩子
Oh, yeah, that's a good boy.

1163
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:21,260
格雷戈 来一杯吗?
Greg, will you join us?

1164
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:23,090
哦 不用了
Oh, I'm okay.

1165
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:25,590
来嘛 别扫我的兴嘛!
Oh, come on, don't be a party pooper!

1166
00:55:26,090 --> 00:55:27,590
那好吧!
Alright, alright!

1167
00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:30,600
那我们接着采访吧
Now we can get back to our interview.

1168
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:32,870
所以 基本上就是这么拍
So, basically, this whole setup

1169
00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:34,270
就这样 懂吧...
is so that, you know...

1170
00:55:34,270 --> 00:55:36,140
我能跟你说话 你也能跟我说话...
I can talk to you, you can talk to me...

1171
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:38,740
我能看见你 你也能看见我
and I can see you, and you can see me.

1172
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:39,970
只不过对面不是真正的我 是个手机
Except it's not really me, it's a phone.

1173
00:55:39,970 --> 00:55:41,670
我知道这听起来有点怪
And I know that sounds kind of weird,

1174
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:43,740
但其实不怪
but it's not.

1175
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:46,280
反正就把它当成慰问卡
So, anyway, just treat it like a get-well card,

1176
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:47,810
你们可以对着镜头
you can look into the lens.

1177
00:55:47,810 --> 00:55:49,640
然后...
And, uh...

1178
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:51,580
就是个小视频嘛...
yeah, it's a video, so you know...

1179
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:52,650
别把它想得太难
don't think about it too hard,

1180
00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:54,580
好好说就行
but just make it good.

1181
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:55,950
准备好了就开始吧
Start whenever you're ready.

1182
00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:57,650
嗨 瑞秋
Hi, Rachel.

1183
00:55:57,650 --> 00:56:00,020
我跟你虽然不是太熟...
I guess I don't really know you that well...

1184
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:02,150
但是我对你有信心 你会康复的
but I believe in you. You can do it.

1185
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,120
说得挺好的
That's real nice, yo.

1186
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:05,960
你男朋友为你拍这个
It's so sweet that your boyfriend

1187
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,690
真是太甜蜜了
is doing this for you.

1188
00:56:07,690 --> 00:56:09,230
他一定很爱你
He must really love you.

1189
00:56:09,230 --> 00:56:11,060
妹子 那不是她男友
Girl, that ain't her boyfriend.

1190
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:12,860
哦
Oh.

1191
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:14,900
我知道你是犹太人 但我还是想告诉你
I know you're Jewish, but I just wanted you to know

1192
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:16,970
上帝自有安排
that God has a plan for you.

1193
00:56:16,970 --> 00:56:18,070
你看着真的挺酷的
You seem like a really cool person.

1194
00:56:18,070 --> 00:56:19,830
我知道我们没说过几句话
I know we don't really talk.

1195
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:22,900
但你朋友很多 而且...
But you've got a lot of friends. And, uh...

1196
00:56:22,910 --> 00:56:23,800
在学校的这些人里头
out of all the people in this school,

1197
00:56:23,810 --> 00:56:26,140
我并不讨厌你
I don't hate you.

1198
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:28,140
我对你有信心 你会康复的
I believe in you and you can do it.

1199
00:56:28,770 --> 00:56:30,270
你会康复的
You can do it.

1200
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:31,810
我对你有信心
I believe in you.

1201
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:33,880
你会康复的
You can do it.

1202
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:35,080
该死
Damn.

1203
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:44,080
"下午2:48的牛郎"(仿"午夜牛郎")

1204
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:51,920
# 每个人都在对我说话 #
# Everybody's talking at me #

1205
00:56:52,990 --> 00:56:56,680
# 我却一个字也听不进去 #
# I don't hear a word they're saying #

1206
00:56:56,790 --> 00:57:00,350
# 只有我的心思在回荡 #
# Only the echoes of my mind #

1207
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:02,200
所以再次地
So again,

1208
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:04,030
如果这是一个浪漫又感人的故事...
if this was a touching, romantic story...

1209
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:06,200
显然我们会坠入爱河
we'd obviously fall in love

1210
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:07,940
她会说些聪明又美妙的情话...
and she'd say all the wise, beautiful things...

1211
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:11,070
让我直到人生暮年才能琢磨明白
that I can only be learned in life's twilight or whatever.

1212
00:57:11,070 --> 00:57:12,940
之后她会在我的臂弯中死去
And then she'd die in my arms.

1213
00:57:18,410 --> 00:57:21,010
但再一次地 这些都未发生
But again, that's not what happened.

1214
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:23,980
她只是变得更沉默 更不开心
She just got quieter. And unhappier.

1215
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:26,720
那你还好吗?
So, how are you?

1216
00:57:27,850 --> 00:57:29,050
说实话
For real.

1217
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:31,850
说实话?
For real?

1218
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,390
我觉得你可能说对了
Feeling like you might have been right.

1219
00:57:38,930 --> 00:57:40,170
什么时候说对了?
Right when?

1220
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:42,990
十月的时候
Back in October,

1221
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:46,200
你当时觉得我快死了
when you thought I was dying.

1222
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:54,800
我想说 我很后悔那么想
Well, I mean, I regret thinking that.

1223
00:57:57,010 --> 00:57:58,270
不用后悔
Don't regret it.

1224
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:20,790
什么声音?
What is that noise?

1225
00:58:20,790 --> 00:58:22,390
一只懊悔的北极熊
It's Regretful Polar Bear.

1226
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:27,400
在动物世界里 北极熊
Polar Bears have the purest expression

1227
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,840
表达懊悔的方式最质朴
of regret in the animal kingdom.

1228
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:33,530
你听听这声音里的悲伤哀怨多么挥之不去啊
Just listen to how haunting and plaintive they sound.

1229
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,940
拜托别逗我笑 有点痛
Don't make me laugh. Please. It kinda hurts.
1172

1230
00:58:41,470 --> 00:58:42,710
好吧
All right.

1231
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,720
令人恐惧的沉默
Kind of a monster silence in here.

1232
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:58,920
嗯
Yeah.

1233
00:59:01,390 --> 00:59:03,520
沉默一会儿也不错
It's okay to just be silent for a while.

1234
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:08,290
听着
Look,

1235
00:59:08,290 --> 00:59:10,130
我知道你们都在准备接受...
I know you're really bracing for this sweet girl...

1236
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:12,860
你们可能很喜欢的这个可爱女生死去
that you probably like a lot to die.

1237
00:59:12,870 --> 00:59:16,170
耐心听我讲 她没死 她身体变好了
Just please bear with me. She doesn't. She gets better.

1238
00:59:16,170 --> 00:59:18,030
我发誓
I promise.

1239
00:59:57,210 --> 00:59:59,470
那个冬天我所记得的...
Pretty much all I remember from that winter...

1240
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:01,310
几乎都是制作那部蠢片子...
is working on that stupid film...

1241
01:00:01,310 --> 01:00:04,540
想尽量拍点有意义的东西...
Just trying to make something that made some kind of sense...

1242
01:00:04,550 --> 01:00:06,210
同时又一直清楚我做不到...
and knowing the whole time that I couldn't...

1243
01:00:06,210 --> 01:00:09,520
拍出我们想要的东西应该是可行的...
Maybe it's possible to make the thing we wanted to make...

1244
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,520
只是我们办不到罢了
but it wasn't possible for us.

1245

1263
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:21,060
我是说 当然
I mean, obviously,

1264
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:22,820
我也记得去瑞秋家的事
I remember visiting Rachel too.

1265
01:00:24,890 --> 01:00:26,160
有的时候她会说说话
Sometimes she talked,

1266
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,060
有的时候又不想说
and sometimes, she didn't want to.

1267
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:31,400
她不想说的时候 就我来说
When she didn't want to, I talked.

1268
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:33,070
或者我们一起看电影
Or we watched movies.

1269
01:00:33,570 --> 01:00:34,690
有的时候她会开怀大笑
Sometimes, she laughed.

1270
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:37,630
有的时候又不笑
Sometimes, she didn't.

1271
01:00:43,670 --> 01:00:46,240
我唯一没有印象的 是做课堂作业
What I don't remember is doing schoolwork.

1272
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:51,240
这段时间我一点作业都没做
I did literally zero schoolwork during this time.

1273
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:58,920
不是夸张
Not figuratively.

1274
01:00:59,950 --> 01:01:02,250
真的一点作业都没做
Literally zero schoolwork.

1275
01:01:06,990 --> 01:01:08,910
其实要做到还挺难的
That's actually sort of hard to do.

1276
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:30,150
学校里现在怎么样了?
So, what's going on at school?

1277
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:35,250
现在整个学校像一座城堡...
Well, right now, the whole school looks like a castle...

1278
01:01:35,250 --> 01:01:38,490
因为每个人都在为中世纪舞会做准备
'cause everyone's getting ready for Medieval Prom.

1279
01:01:41,260 --> 01:01:44,060
我猜大家都想搞清楚 例如说...
I guess everyone's trying to figure out how to, like...

1280
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:45,300
中世纪的电臀舞怎么跳?
twerk medievally?

1281
01:01:47,090 --> 01:01:48,430
你要参加吗?
Are you going?

1282
01:01:48,430 --> 01:01:49,660
当然不参加
No, of course not.

1283
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:51,360
你应该参加的
You should go.

1284
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:52,700
没门!
No way!

1285
01:01:53,730 --> 01:01:55,530
你见过我穿晚礼服吗?
Have you seen me in a tux?

1286
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:59,730
就像让小狗穿人的衣服似的
It's like when they make a dog wear human clothes.

1287
01:01:59,740 --> 01:02:01,400
你见过吗?
Have you seen that?

1288
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:03,700
那样只会让你看着惨兮兮的
It just makes you really sad to look at.

1289
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:09,340
而且没人跟我一起去
Oh, and I don't have anyone to go with.

1290
01:02:09,340 --> 01:02:10,580
所以咯
So there's that.

1291
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:17,680
除非...
Unless...

1292
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:19,420
你愿意去...
you know... you wanted to...

1293
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:21,380
格雷戈 我不会去舞会的
Greg, I'm not going to prom.

1294
01:02:21,390 --> 01:02:23,420
我是说 你完全可以去
I mean, you totally could.

1295
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:25,190
就当是一个... 很棒的姿态
It could be like a, s... awesome statement.

1296
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:27,320
嘿 嗯...
Hey, uh...

1297
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:30,060
你们的片子什么时候拍完?
When are you guys finishing your movie?

1298
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:35,660
你不会知道我们现在在拍电影吧
You don't know we're working on a movie right now.

1299
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,630
别装了
You don't have to pretend.

1300
01:02:37,630 --> 01:02:40,230
厄尔跟我说 你们正在给我拍电影
Earl told me you guys were making a movie for me.

1301
01:02:43,030 --> 01:02:44,200
天啊 好吧...
God, yeah...

1302
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,200
看来他多半是说了
I guess he probably did.

1303
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:49,470
我就问问 因为...
I was just asking, because...

1304
01:02:49,470 --> 01:02:51,500
该死 厄尔! 啊
Goddamn it, Earl! Ugh.

1305
01:02:51,510 --> 01:02:53,710
那应该 那本该是个惊喜的!
It was just, it was supposed to be a surprise!

1306
01:02:54,610 --> 01:02:56,570
你知道吗? 好像永远也
You know? It's just taking forever to

1307
01:02:56,580 --> 01:02:58,110
拍不出想要的感觉 而且...
really want it to get it right, and...

1308
01:02:58,110 --> 01:03:00,740
我可能很快就要停止化疗了
I'm probably gonna stop treatment pretty soon.

1309
01:03:05,650 --> 01:03:06,890
什么?
What?

1310
01:03:11,150 --> 01:03:13,120
化疗一点没让我见好
It just isn't doing me any good.

1311
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:15,090
只是让我越来越糟
All it's doing is making me sicker.

1312
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:26,530
但是... 如果你停止化疗 那...
Yeah, but it... I mean, if you stop, then...

1313
01:03:26,530 --> 01:03:28,430
我们看看到时结果又如何吧
Well, we'll just see what happens.

1314
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:32,470
我们知道结果会如何 对吧?
Well, we know what's gonna happen, right?

1315
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,140
我知道你可以带谁去舞会
I know who you can take to prom.

1316
01:03:50,110 --> 01:03:51,230
谁?
Who?

1317
01:03:53,650 --> 01:03:55,280
这个性感的枕头
This sexy pillow here.

1318
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:56,380
天啊 你能不能...
Oh, my God, can you just...

1319
01:03:56,390 --> 01:03:58,280
哦 格雷戈
Ooh, Greg,

1320
01:03:58,290 --> 01:03:59,420
这个枕头名叫弗朗西丝科
this pillow's name is Francesca.

1321
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:00,590
别开玩笑 我受不了
Don't joke, I can't deal with that.

1322
01:04:00,590 --> 01:04:01,620
她是一个浪荡的意大利女人
She's a filthy Italian woman.

1323
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:02,860
拜托 打住!
Please, stop!

1324
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:06,290
别吼我
Don't yell at me.

1325
01:04:06,290 --> 01:04:07,790
就这样? 让大学去死吧
So, that's it? Just, to hell with college,

1326
01:04:07,790 --> 01:04:08,720
让长大去死吧?
to hell with growing up?

1327
01:04:08,730 --> 01:04:10,290
格雷戈 别这样
Greg, don't.

1328
01:04:10,290 --> 01:04:11,560
瑞秋 你到底发什么神经?
Rachel, what the hell is wrong with you?

1329
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:13,130
这可是你的人生!
This is your life!

1330
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:16,260
对 这就是我的人生
Yeah, it is my life.

1331
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:19,570
是我必须整日卧床
It's me who has to lie in bed all day,

1332
01:04:19,570 --> 01:04:20,770
头发剃光...
with a shaved head...

1333
01:04:20,770 --> 01:04:22,770
日渐衰弱 日渐丑陋
getting weaker and uglier,

1334
01:04:22,770 --> 01:04:26,440
日渐悲哀 未来渺无希望
and more miserable, with no hope in sight.

1335
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:28,110
是我要忍受这一切
I'm the one who has to suffer through this,

1336
01:04:28,110 --> 01:04:30,110
不是你 所以别冲我大喊大叫的
not you, so don't yell at me.

1337
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:35,080
我道歉 但我不会坐视不管
I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna sit here

1338
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:37,480
眼看你死掉却无动于衷
and get comfortable watching you die.

1339
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:41,280
好吗? 我办不到 我做不到
Okay? I'm not. I'm not gonna do that.

1340
01:04:41,550 --> 01:04:43,290
所以别这样要求我
So don't ask me to.

1341
01:04:44,550 --> 01:04:45,420
如果你不能接受
If you can't accept

1342
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:48,460
我要如何过我自己的人生...
that I'm going to do what I want to do with my life...

1343
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,390
那你真是个差劲的朋友
then you're a terrible friend.

1344
01:04:53,230 --> 01:04:54,760
我差劲?
I'm a terrible friend?

1345
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:55,730
行
Okay.

1346
01:04:55,730 --> 01:04:58,400
我可不是那个放弃的人
You know, I'm not the one giving up.

1347
01:04:58,400 --> 01:04:59,700
我也没有因为自暴自弃
I'm not ruining my friend's life

1348
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:01,400
而毁掉朋友的生活
by giving up on the whole world.

1349
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:03,370
拜托 格雷戈 你应该欢天喜地啊
Oh, please, Greg, you should be overjoyed.

1350
01:05:03,370 --> 01:05:04,630
你现在可以回归自己那种
Now you can go back to your life

1351
01:05:04,630 --> 01:05:06,870
毫无存在感 与人疏离...
of being invisible and detached...

1352
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:08,570
又自我憎恨的生活了
and self-hating.

1353
01:05:11,270 --> 01:05:12,350
是啊
Yeah.

1354
01:05:13,810 --> 01:05:15,970
你也可以回归你等死的生活了
And you can go back to your life of being dead.

1355
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:19,710
好 好极了
Nice. Really nice.

1356
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:27,580
你妈妈会难过死的
This is gonna kill your mom.

1357
01:05:31,650 --> 01:05:33,850
你现在可以坦然接受了?
Have you gotten comfortable with that?

1358
01:05:37,690 --> 01:05:39,830
想想你妈妈?
That doesn't bother you anymore?

1359
01:05:39,830 --> 01:05:40,860
你不再烦恼了?
Thinking about your mom?

1360
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:42,230
出去 格雷戈
Get outta here, Greg.

1361
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:43,900
你任务完成了
You've done your time.

1362
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:46,220
你不用再陪着这个病怏怏的女孩了
You don't have to hang around with the sick girl anymore.

1363
01:05:49,670 --> 01:05:52,110
你怎么能这么说?
How can you even say that to me?

1364
01:05:52,770 --> 01:05:55,540
你妈妈逼着你和我玩
Your mom forced you to hang out with me.

1365
01:05:55,540 --> 01:05:57,310
厄尔逼着你给我看你们的电影
Earl forced you to show me your movies.

1366
01:05:57,310 --> 01:05:59,480
麦迪森逼着你给我拍电影
Madison forced you to make a movie about me.

1367
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:01,580
所以 有哪一件是你真心想做的?
So, what part of this did you actually want to do?

1368
01:06:21,730 --> 01:06:24,030
就... 就这一次对我行行好吧
Just... just do something nice for me for once

1369
01:06:24,030 --> 01:06:25,730
出去吧
and just get out.

1370
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:53,320
厄尔!
Earl!

1371
01:06:53,330 --> 01:06:55,730
到此为止了! 你过分了!
This is it! You've gone too far!

1372
01:06:55,730 --> 01:06:56,930
这么机密的事你也漏了出去
You've leaked the unleakable secret

1373
01:06:56,930 --> 01:06:58,590
就因为你什么也不在乎
because you hold nothing sacred.

1374
01:06:58,600 --> 01:06:59,660
因为你就是个蠢货!
'Cause you're a dickhead!

1375
01:06:59,660 --> 01:07:02,760
任何良好的工作伙伴关系都基于信任...
The foundation of any good working partnership is trust...

1376
01:07:02,770 --> 01:07:04,530
我无论如何没法再信任你了
and I can no longer trust you in any way.

1377
01:07:04,530 --> 01:07:05,900
你什么事都藏不住
You'll leak anything to anyone.

1378
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:07,470
简直像和朱利安·阿桑奇一起工作(维基解密的董事与发言人)
It's like working with Julian Assange.

1379
01:07:07,470 --> 01:07:09,400
阿桑杰 阿丧吉 该死!
Assangde. Ass-andge. Damn it!

1380
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:15,400
我人生第一次打架篇

1381
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:25,020
你想干嘛?
The hell you want?

1382
01:07:25,020 --> 01:07:27,060
- 等厄尔  - 好吧
- Just waiting for Earl.  - Awright.

1383
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:29,590
怎么了 兄弟? 想进来吗?
Whassup, boy? You gonna come in?

1384
01:07:29,590 --> 01:07:31,820
瑞秋告诉我 你跟她说了...
So, Rachel told me that you told her about the, uh...

1385
01:07:31,820 --> 01:07:33,940
我们给她拍电影的事
about the film that we're making for her.

1386
01:07:35,030 --> 01:07:36,990
你跟朱利安·阿桑奇一个样 老兄
You're like Julian Assange, man.

1387
01:07:36,990 --> 01:07:38,630
你一直都是这样...
It's like you always do this...

1388
01:07:38,630 --> 01:07:39,960
我不知道 因为你 好像
I don't know, 'cause you, like,

1389
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:41,590
你想比我当个更称职的朋友还是怎样?
wanna be a better friend than me or something?

1390
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:42,730
在你这白痴把我卖了之后
I don't know if I can work with you again

1391
01:07:42,730 --> 01:07:43,830
我不知道还能不能跟你一起合作!
after you sell me out like a dick!

1392
01:07:43,830 --> 01:07:45,900
好吧 给我小心点
Oh, okay. Watch out, yo.

1393
01:07:47,330 --> 01:07:49,570
嘿 闭上你的臭嘴 老兄!
Hey, yo, shut your ass up, man!

1394
01:07:49,570 --> 01:07:50,870
别摆出一幅很在意别人想法的样子
Like you care so much about what other people think,

1395
01:07:50,870 --> 01:07:52,000
小子 你四处晃荡...
boy, you go around here...

1396
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,470
捧别人臭脚 装得很在乎朋友
kissin' everybody ass,pretend that you like your friend a lot

1397
01:07:53,470 --> 01:07:56,910
听着 别人才不在乎你呢 格雷戈!
Look, nobody gives a shit about you, Greg!

1398
01:07:56,910 --> 01:07:57,970
懂了吧? 没人在乎!
All right? Nobody give a shit!

1399
01:07:57,970 --> 01:07:59,670
揍他!
Whoop his ass!

1400
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:01,840
然后终于有个在乎你的女孩...
And then the one girl who do actually care about you...

1401
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:03,040
你倒跑到这来
you wanna come over here and

1402
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:05,780
跟我叽歪抱怨电影的事? 哈?
bitch and whine about some films, yo? Huh?

1403
01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:08,080
是因为终于有人在乎你了吗?
Because somebody actually cares about you?

1404
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:09,650
该死 我简直烦透你了
Like, damn, I'm so tired of you

1405
01:08:09,650 --> 01:08:11,480
你把这姑娘当成个负担
treating this girl like she a burden.

1406
01:08:11,490 --> 01:08:13,380
要知道 她的生命都要终结了!
You know, her life is over after this!

1407
01:08:13,390 --> 01:08:14,750
而你倒跑过来
And you want to come over here

1408
01:08:14,750 --> 01:08:17,820
跟我叽歪些毫不相关的鸡毛蒜皮!
bitchin' and whinin' about some irrelevant bullshit!

1409
01:08:17,820 --> 01:08:19,690
你离我这么近 我可以把你揍得屁滚尿流 小子!
Like, yo, you so close to me knocking your shit loose right now, son!

1410
01:08:19,690 --> 01:08:21,060
你揍啊!
Go for it!

1411
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:24,130
- 你想让我揍你是吧?  - 对 我不在乎!
- You want me to hit you now?  - Yeah, I don't care!

1412
01:08:24,130 --> 01:08:25,930
是啊 厄尔 你来啊!
Yeah, Earl, I want you to!

1413
01:08:25,930 --> 01:08:28,330
对啦! 把这小子顶翻!
That's right! Jack that little dude up there!

1414
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:34,730
瞧见了吧 格雷戈?
See, Greg?

1415
01:08:34,730 --> 01:08:37,570
算你走运 揍你的是他而不是我...
You lucky that was him and not me out there...

1416
01:08:37,570 --> 01:08:39,600
要不然我非把你揍得上蹿下跳
'cause I'd have been whooping your ass up and down this street.

1417
01:08:39,610 --> 01:08:41,970
揍得满地找牙 你懂吗?
It'd have been a ass-whoopin' fest around here, you dig?

1418
01:08:50,650 --> 01:08:53,550
那个20页的尼克松论文写得怎么样了?
So what's the status on the 20-pager on Nixon?

1419
01:08:54,820 --> 01:08:58,450
我还要再延期一次
Uh, I need another extension.

1420
01:08:58,450 --> 01:09:00,550
那可能会有点难...
That might prove difficult...

1421
01:09:00,550 --> 01:09:03,120
因为已经是...
seeing how it's the...

1422
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:04,920
这学期的末尾了
the end of the quarter and all.

1423
01:09:05,490 --> 01:09:08,060
我最近比较忙
Yeah, I've just been busy.

1424
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:11,860
我听说了...
You know, I heard...

1425
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:16,800
瑞秋的事
about Rachel.

1426
01:09:17,970 --> 01:09:19,500
你还撑得住吧?
How you holding up?

1427
01:09:23,740 --> 01:09:24,980
其实...
You know...

1428
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:27,510
不太行
not great.

1429
01:09:33,180 --> 01:09:36,910
我15岁的时候父亲去世了 格雷戈
You know, my dad died when I was 15, Greg.

1430
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:39,620
我那会儿比你还小几岁
A couple years younger than you.

1431
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:42,120
事实上 当我还是个小孩的时候...
You know, the thing is that, when I was a kid...

1432
01:09:43,150 --> 01:09:45,920
我真的只记得
I really, I really can only remember

1433
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:48,020
他在我眼里是个...
thinking about him as this...

1434
01:09:48,030 --> 01:09:50,890
人高马大的混蛋
you know, big, kind of like asshole guy.

1435
01:09:52,790 --> 01:09:54,930
在为他守夜的时候 他的哥们
At his wake, these buddies of his

1436
01:09:54,930 --> 01:09:56,200
不断走过来...
kept coming up to me...

1437
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:59,100
跟我说些他的故事
and telling me these stories about him.

1438
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:01,100
他们口中的那个人
And it was like they were talking about

1439
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:02,770
完全是另一副样子
some complete other guy.

1440
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:05,940
举个例子
To give you an example.

1441
01:10:07,070 --> 01:10:10,010
他知道所有70年代的
He knew every single European pop song

1442
01:10:10,010 --> 01:10:11,640
欧洲流行歌曲
from the 1970s.

1443
01:10:11,810 --> 01:10:13,310
每一首
Every single one.

1444
01:10:13,780 --> 01:10:15,110
他会背下这些歌
He'd memorize these songs,

1445
01:10:15,110 --> 01:10:17,180
这样就可以去...
and he'd do that so he could go...

1446
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:19,710
唱给酒吧里的德国姑娘们听
and sing them to German girls in bars.

1447
01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:22,510
他有些拿手歌曲
He had a go-to,

1448
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:24,650
最拿手的是...
his number one go-to song. It was a...

1449
01:10:26,050 --> 01:10:29,790
是一首荷兰歌 叫"叮啊咚"
it was a Dutch song. It was called Ding-a-Dong.

1450
01:10:31,990 --> 01:10:35,060
我爸常唱给酒吧里的德国姑娘们听
My dad used to sing that to German girls in bars.

1451
01:10:36,530 --> 01:10:37,960
事实如此
That's a fact.

1452
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:43,460
所以你想说什么?
So what does that mean?

1453
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:48,860
格雷戈 我想说的是...
Well, Greg, I think that it just means that...

1454
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:52,170
就算某个人去世了 你也能...
even after somebody dies, you can...

1455
01:10:53,670 --> 01:10:55,790
你也能继续了解他们
you can still keep learning about them.

1456
01:10:56,770 --> 01:10:59,140
了解他们的人生
You know, their life.

1457
01:11:01,650 --> 01:11:04,150
他们人生的画卷会继续向你展开 只要...
It can keep unfolding itself to you just as long...

1458
01:11:05,750 --> 01:11:07,990
只要你用心去看
just as long as you pay attention to it.

1459
01:11:09,250 --> 01:11:10,680
你真的要把这变成
Are you seriously trying to turn this

1460
01:11:10,690 --> 01:11:12,850
一个愚蠢又煽情的说教吗?
into some stupid sappy lesson?

1461
01:11:15,220 --> 01:11:16,920
你是个好孩子 格雷戈
You're a good kid, Greg.

1462
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:19,120
不是的! 听着 我要回家了
No! Look, I'm going home.

1463
01:11:21,130 --> 01:11:23,660
我当着你的面逃课 怎么样?
See, I'm cutting class right in front of you. 'Kay?

1464
01:11:23,660 --> 01:11:26,000
我不是个好孩子 我不是
I'm not a good kid. I'm not.

1465
01:11:43,180 --> 01:11:44,180
好吧
Okay.

1466
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:47,550
厄尔刚刚过来留下了东西...
Earl came by earlier to drop something off...

1467
01:11:47,550 --> 01:11:49,650
但是他拒绝了这个美味的
but he turned down this superb

1468
01:11:49,650 --> 01:11:51,820
法式昂杜耶兔肉香肠...
Andouille rabbit sausage...

1469
01:11:51,820 --> 01:11:53,550
不像他的作风
which is quite unlike him.

1470
01:11:54,790 --> 01:11:56,090
你们还好吧?
Is everything all right?

1471
01:11:57,690 --> 01:11:58,790
老弟?
Buddy?

1472
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:07,790
我退出

1473
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:17,790
"嘿 瑞秋
"Hey, Rachel.

1474
01:12:17,870 --> 01:12:19,110
我们试了很多种方法
We tried a lot of different ways

1475
01:12:19,110 --> 01:12:21,140
为你拍电影...
of making a film for you...

1476
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:23,880
但要么太傻 要么太不着边际
but they were all too goofy or irrelevant...

1477
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:25,850
或者干脆不合我们的感觉
or just not what we wanted.

1478
01:12:25,850 --> 01:12:27,910
所以我就直接跟你说吧
So, now I'm gonna talk to you directly.

1479
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:30,580
嗯...
Um...

1480
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:32,980
我要说大实话 好吗?
All right, I'm gonna be honest here. Okay?

1481
01:12:32,990 --> 01:12:35,320
有的时候 白人女孩特别傻
Sometimes, white girls are particularly stupid.

1482
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:39,790
我是说 每个人都挺傻的 但是白人女孩...
I mean, everybody's stupid, but white girls, you know...

1483
01:12:39,790 --> 01:12:41,560
她们觉得自己比其他人优越
They think they better than everybody

1484
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:43,560
明明自我中心 还假装不是
and self-centered and pretend they not.

1485
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:45,900
但是...
But...

1486
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:47,820
你和她们不一样 嗯...
you aren't like that, you know. Um...

1487
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:50,730
你居然可以这么耐心
It's just crazy how patient you've been.

1488
01:12:50,730 --> 01:12:52,930
如果是我得癌症的话 呃...
You know, I know if it was me that had cancer, uh...

1489
01:12:54,070 --> 01:12:56,770
我会沮丧又愤怒
I'd be upset and angry

1490
01:12:56,770 --> 01:12:59,810
一大半的时间都想打人
and trying to beat everybody's ass half the time.

1491
01:12:59,810 --> 01:13:02,910
所以你的耐心真把我惊呆了
So I'm just, I'm just amazed at how patient you've been.

1492
01:13:05,580 --> 01:13:07,350
你让我感觉自己是有福的"
You, you make me feel blessed."

1493
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:17,680
"'曲终梦回'一片是由
"Tales of Hoffmann is a film

1494
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:21,060
麦克·鲍威尔和艾默里克·普瑞斯伯格联合出品
by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger.

1495
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:24,160
我认为 看这部电影的观众
I think, ultimately, what one has to understand

1496
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:25,890
最终必须要明白...
watching this film...

1497
01:13:25,900 --> 01:13:28,230
这是电影制作史上的一朵奇葩"
it's a very special piece of filmmaking."

1498
01:13:30,170 --> 01:13:31,800
你还是要在这吃饭吗?
Are you eating lunch in here still?

1499
01:13:32,970 --> 01:13:35,230
除非你也要在这吃
Not if you are.

1500
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:37,280
要是你在这吃 我就找别的地方
Well, I'm not eating lunch in here if you are.

1501
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,870
那就好 反正我喜欢在这吃
Good, 'cause I like it in here.

1502
01:13:40,870 --> 01:13:42,810
那看来该走的是我
So I guess I could just go.

1503
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:44,880
要不还是你走吧
Or you could go.

1504
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:48,440
才不 我喜欢这的空调
No, I like the air-conditioner.

1505
01:13:48,450 --> 01:13:50,450
还有舒适的椅子
And I like the comfortable chair.

1506
01:13:54,150 --> 01:13:56,220
没错 我也喜欢
Yeah, I like those too.

1507
01:13:57,350 --> 01:13:59,450
那是你的问题
Sounds like your damn problem.

1508
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:04,220
"它每周放映一部电影
"Which showed one film per week

1509
01:14:04,230 --> 01:14:06,390
一晚两场 周六有三场
twice a night, and three times on Saturday.

1510
01:14:07,460 --> 01:14:09,330
某种程度上 '曲终梦回'是
In a way, Tales of Hoffmann is

1511
01:14:09,330 --> 01:14:13,730
'鲍威尔-普雷斯伯格'组合出品的
the culmination of Powell-Pressburger's work

1512
01:14:13,730 --> 01:14:15,930
所有'作曲式电影'中的巅峰之作"
with what they call the composed film."

1513
01:14:20,730 --> 01:14:22,930
2014年高中毕业舞会 "难忘佳骑"

1514
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:35,930
申请状态更改

1515
01:14:39,090 --> 01:14:40,410
能聊聊那电影的事吗?
Can I talk to you about the movie?

1516
01:14:42,090 --> 01:14:44,060
可以 电影还没拍好
Yeah, it's not done yet.

1517
01:14:44,060 --> 01:14:45,120
格雷戈 你们已经足足拍了
Greg, you guys have been working on it

1518
01:14:45,130 --> 01:14:46,290
有四个月了
for like four months.

1519
01:14:48,630 --> 01:14:50,860
没错 但是我们试了很多法子
Yeah, well, I don't know, we tried a bunch of stuff

1520
01:14:50,860 --> 01:14:54,360
可就是... 行不通
and it just... didn't really work.

1521
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:55,260
达不到想要的效果
It's not that good.

1522
01:14:55,260 --> 01:14:56,960
格雷戈!
Greg!

1523
01:14:56,970 --> 01:14:59,400
这可不是你自我否定的时候
Now is not the time for your "I'm Greg, I suck,"

1524
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,070
别老想着 "我是格雷戈 烂人一个 啥也干不好"
"nothing I do is any good" thing.

1525
01:15:01,070 --> 01:15:02,370
你肯定拍得很棒
I'm sure what you have is awesome

1526
01:15:02,370 --> 01:15:04,400
只要果断点拍完给瑞秋
and I think she would really benefit

1527
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:06,440
她看了一定能受到鼓舞
if you just got it done and gave it to her.

1528
01:15:07,470 --> 01:15:09,170
麦迪森 她停止化疗了
Madison, she stopped treatment.

1529
01:15:12,370 --> 01:15:13,570
她放弃了
She gave up.

1530
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:17,040
投降了
She quit.

1531
01:15:19,450 --> 01:15:20,980
那不是更有理由早点拍完
Well, I guess that's a really good reason

1532
01:15:20,980 --> 01:15:22,250
那该死的电影
to just finish the fucking movie.

1533
01:15:22,250 --> 01:15:23,450
早点给她看
And give it to her.

1534
01:15:25,850 --> 01:15:27,020
随你便吧
But whatever.

1535
01:15:40,030 --> 01:15:41,260
亲爱的?
Honey?

1536
01:15:43,070 --> 01:15:44,100
怎么了?
What?

1537
01:15:50,140 --> 01:15:52,040
瑞秋又回医院去了
Rachel's back in the hospital, honey.

1538
01:15:56,510 --> 01:15:58,790
等等 她又开始化疗了吗?
Wait, is she starting treatment again?

1539
01:16:01,110 --> 01:16:02,980
亲爱的 她不是去化疗的
It's not for treatment, honey.

1540
01:16:12,890 --> 01:16:14,190
妈 你想说什么?
Mom, what?

1541
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:16,890
我想我们应该去...
Well, I thought we could go and...

1542
01:16:16,890 --> 01:16:19,590
你把这当成最后一次能逼我陪她玩的机会 是吗?
You thought it's your last chance to force me to hang out with her?

1543
01:16:19,590 --> 01:16:21,090
格雷戈 别这样
Greg, come on.

1544
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:22,290
别担心 妈妈 瑞秋走了以后
Don't worry, Mom, I'm sure you can find

1545
01:16:22,300 --> 01:16:24,460
你肯定还能找到另一个身患绝症的女孩
another girl with cancer after Rachel dies,

1546
01:16:25,830 --> 01:16:27,360
另外瑞秋她...
which, by the way...

1547
01:16:28,030 --> 01:16:29,500
是自己决定不化疗的
she's decided to do.

1548
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:34,540
是自己决定等死的
She's just decided to die

1549
01:16:34,540 --> 01:16:37,210
那我自己也可以决定不去看她
so maybe I can decide not to visit her.

1550
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:45,850
如果你不去探望她
I promise you, you will regret that

1551
01:16:45,850 --> 01:16:46,930
你铁定会后悔的
if you don't visit her.

1552
01:16:48,250 --> 01:16:50,050
会后悔终生
You'll regret it for the rest of your life.

1553
01:16:50,050 --> 01:16:51,850
你知道吗 妈妈? 也许你说得对
Yeah, you know what mom? That's probably true.

1554
01:16:51,850 --> 01:16:53,080
但说真的 我该后悔的糟心事
But honestly, I have a shitload of things

1555
01:16:53,090 --> 01:16:55,090
已经够多了
to regret right now.

1556
01:16:55,090 --> 01:16:57,350
我后悔明天那该死的舞会没有舞伴
I regret not having a date for tomorrow's stupid prom.

1557
01:16:57,360 --> 01:17:00,090
后悔太怪里怪气交不到朋友
I regret being too weird to make friends.

1558
01:17:00,090 --> 01:17:01,260
还特别后悔跟厄尔拍了那些
I definitely regret making

1559
01:17:01,260 --> 01:17:02,920
乱七八糟的电影
all those shitty films with Earl.

1560
01:17:02,930 --> 01:17:05,130
我估计你已经看了匹兹堡大学的邮件吧?
And I assume you saw the email I got today, from Pitt?

1561
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:08,030
没有? 你居然没看到
Oh, no? You didn't see it

1562
01:17:08,030 --> 01:17:09,190
你不是老乱翻我东西吗? 给你
while you're going though all my shit? Here.

1563
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:11,430
看吧
Have a look.

1564
01:17:11,430 --> 01:17:12,930
我真是后悔
I'm definitely gonna regret

1565
01:17:12,930 --> 01:17:14,610
这一整年什么作业都没做!
doing literally no school work this year!

1566
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:16,200
天哪 格雷戈
Oh, my God, Greg.

1567
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:18,230
我知道 取消录取
I know. Admission rescinded,

1568
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:20,340
因为学习成绩一落千丈
due to significant change in my academic record.

1569
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:22,200
这下可好 明年上不了大学了
Oh, well, no college next year.

1570
01:17:22,210 --> 01:17:24,140
那就呆在家好了 这下你可惨了
I guess I'll just be home, which sucks for you

1571
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:25,110
因为你再想乱翻我的东西
because it's gonna be so hard for you

1572
01:17:25,110 --> 01:17:26,910
可就难了
to go through all my stuff.

1573
01:17:26,910 --> 01:17:28,380
你现在能不能做点好事 妈妈?
Can you just do me a favor right now, Mom?

1574
01:17:28,380 --> 01:17:30,040
让我一个人静静 好吗?
Just leave me alone. Okay?

1575
01:17:30,050 --> 01:17:31,640
就让我待在这里后悔吧
Just let me sit here and regret stuff.

1576
01:17:31,650 --> 01:17:33,010
我要好好回想
I'm just gonna think about

1577
01:17:33,010 --> 01:17:34,110
我做过的一切
all the things that I've ever done

1578
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:35,550
我没去做的一切
and all the things I haven't done

1579
01:17:35,550 --> 01:17:37,990
然后好好后悔一场 好吗?
and just regret the living shit out of it. Okay?

1580
01:17:43,090 --> 01:17:45,260
所有申请都截止了 维克托
All the deadlines have passed, Victor.

1581
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:46,520
那他明年该怎么办?
What's he gonna do next year?

1582
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:47,990
白白浪费一年吗?
He's just gonna waste the year?

1583
01:17:47,990 --> 01:17:49,290
他正伤心呢 亲爱的
He is grieving, honey.

1584
01:17:49,290 --> 01:17:50,590
给他一点时间吧
You have to let him grieve.

1585
01:17:50,590 --> 01:17:51,590
但我不能坐视不理
But I can't just sit by

1586
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:53,330
眼看着他毁掉自己的人生
and just let him ruin his life.

1587
01:17:53,330 --> 01:17:56,530
又不是错过大学申请
The universe does not operate

1588
01:17:56,530 --> 01:17:58,250
世界就不运转了!
according to a college deadline!

1589
01:18:03,530 --> 01:18:06,250
2014年高中毕业舞会 "难忘佳骑" 就在今晚!!

1590
01:18:17,420 --> 01:18:18,520
能问你点事吗?
Can I ask you something?

1591
01:18:20,020 --> 01:18:21,390
不能
Nope.

1592
01:18:21,390 --> 01:18:23,020
不是你想的那件事
No. It's not what you think.

1593
01:18:23,020 --> 01:18:24,260
我就想说 今晚就是舞会了...
It's just that prom is tonight and...

1594
01:18:24,260 --> 01:18:26,390
我倒想问问你 这算什么?
Let me ask you something. What is this?

1595
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:29,260
干嘛摸我的手臂?
What is up with the arm touching?

1596
01:18:29,260 --> 01:18:30,460
是仅仅表示友好
Are you just being friendly,

1597
01:18:30,460 --> 01:18:31,930
还是故意使出点小花招
or is this some calculated maneuver

1598
01:18:31,930 --> 01:18:33,330
好让我任你使唤?
to get me to do whatever you want?

1599
01:18:33,330 --> 01:18:34,560
因为你要明白
Cause you have to understand

1600
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:36,330
一个漂亮性感还很体贴的女生
what it does when a beautiful, sexy

1601
01:18:36,330 --> 01:18:37,530
把手放在一个苍白瘦弱
otherwise thoughtful girl

1602
01:18:37,530 --> 01:18:39,430
长着仓鼠脸的男生的手臂上
touches the arm of a scrawny, pasty

1603
01:18:39,430 --> 01:18:40,600
这意味着什么?
groundhog-faced kid, OK?

1604
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:41,700
这是一种残忍
It's an act of cruelty.

1605
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:44,200
你说完了吗?
Are you done?

1606
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:45,400
当然 我说完了
Yeah. Yeah, I'm done.

1607
01:18:45,410 --> 01:18:47,140
我受够你了
I'm done with you.

1608
01:18:47,140 --> 01:18:49,340
受够这愚蠢的电影了
I'm done with this stupid film.

1609
01:18:49,340 --> 01:18:50,710
好吗? 我受够了
All right? I'm done.

1610
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:54,010
哟! 不过我俩还没完呢!
Yo! But you ain't done with me!

1611
01:18:54,010 --> 01:18:55,340
我回来复仇了
I'm back for my revenge

1612
01:18:55,350 --> 01:18:56,610
拿刀捅你的小鸡鸡
Stab you in the dick

1613
01:18:56,610 --> 01:18:58,350
原谅我说脏话
Pardon my French

1614
01:18:58,350 --> 01:19:00,680
真的吗? 你真的要捅我的鸡鸡? 来啊
Really? You're gonna stab me in the dick? Go ahead.

1615
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:02,050
来捅我啊
Stab me in the dick.

1616
01:19:02,050 --> 01:19:04,720
只求你别饶舌了 好吗?
Just no rapping. Okay? All right?

1617
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:06,250
我紧握的拳头
I'll break your eyeball

1618
01:19:06,250 --> 01:19:07,420
打爆你的眼球
with a fist I got clenched

1619
01:19:07,420 --> 01:19:09,220
你瘦弱的身体 推入一条长椅
Shove your body under another bench

1620
01:19:09,220 --> 01:19:11,020
别饶舌了!
Stop rapping!

1621
01:19:11,020 --> 01:19:13,020
用紧握的双拳 打你满地找牙
Knock your teeth out with the fist I got clenched

1622
01:19:13,030 --> 01:19:15,270
你一直唱来唱去 我下不了手
I can't do this if you're gonna rap the whole time.

1623
01:19:36,110 --> 01:19:37,210
都让开!
Break it up!

1624
01:19:37,210 --> 01:19:38,540
厄尔!
Earl!

1625
01:19:38,550 --> 01:19:41,150
都让开! 都让开!
Break it up! Break it up!

1626
01:19:41,150 --> 01:19:42,150
我还以为你在麦卡锡的办公室
I thought you were eating lunch

1627
01:19:42,150 --> 01:19:43,310
吃午饭呢
in Mr. McCarthy's office.

1628
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:44,550
是啊 可他一直在聊伤心事
Man, I was, but he all sad talking

1629
01:19:44,550 --> 01:19:45,680
德国音乐什么的
about German music and shit.

1630
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:47,980
真是无聊透了 老兄
That's boring as hell, man.

1631
01:19:47,990 --> 01:19:50,520
看见你俩参与打架 我真是又震惊又失望
I'm surprised and disappointed to see you two fighting.

1632
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:52,250
还有菲利普 我也没想到会看见
And, Phillip, I'm surprised and disappointed

1633
01:19:52,260 --> 01:19:53,550
你居然出现在校园里
to see you back on school grounds

1634
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:55,190
你都被开除了!
after being expelled!

1635
01:19:55,190 --> 01:19:56,460
好了 同学们
All right, man.

1636
01:19:56,460 --> 01:19:57,290
都离开这儿
Please leave the premises.

1637
01:19:57,290 --> 01:19:58,620
回到教室去
Back to class.

1638
01:19:58,630 --> 01:20:00,160
快去!
Let's go!

1639
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:02,290
麦克斯韦 赖安 索赖德
Maxwell, Ryan, Soledad,

1640
01:20:02,290 --> 01:20:04,560
别傻站着了 快走!
stop gawking and start walking!

1641
01:20:09,430 --> 01:20:11,200
格雷戈!
Greg!

1642
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:13,530
哟 宝贝! 看到我怎么揍这个贱人了吗?
Yo, babe! You see me pummel this bitch?

1643
01:20:13,540 --> 01:20:14,770
你要再不走
Come on and keep walking

1644
01:20:14,770 --> 01:20:16,470
我就再揍你一次 小子
before I can whoop that ass again, man.

1645
01:20:16,470 --> 01:20:17,800
麦迪森 什么事?
Madison, what?

1646
01:20:18,870 --> 01:20:20,340
跟我一起参加舞会吧
Come to prom with me.

1647
01:20:22,770 --> 01:20:24,410
我知道拍电影的事
I know the whole movie situation

1648
01:20:24,410 --> 01:20:26,210
的确给你带来很多困难
was like really difficult for you.

1649
01:20:26,210 --> 01:20:28,290
我觉得这是我的错
and I kind of feel like it was my fault.

1650
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:30,240
所以我想
So I just kind of wanted to

1651
01:20:30,250 --> 01:20:32,570
稍稍补偿你
make it up to you a little bit.

1652
01:20:33,810 --> 01:20:35,610
因为可怜才约我吗?
Is this a pity date?

1653
01:20:35,620 --> 01:20:36,880
不是
No.

1654
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:38,420
不是因为可怜
No, it's not a pity date.

1655
01:20:40,380 --> 01:20:41,580
格雷戈 就跟我一起去舞会嘛
Greg, just come to prom with me.

1656
01:20:41,590 --> 01:20:42,830
一定会是个开心的夜晚
I think we'd have a good time.

1657
01:20:45,820 --> 01:20:47,720
早就说过你能约到人吧
Told you you would get a date.

1658
01:20:48,590 --> 01:20:49,590
没错
Yep.

1659
01:20:55,430 --> 01:20:58,260
燕尾服什么的 不用跟我客气啦
So you're welcome. For the tux and everything.

1660
01:20:59,530 --> 01:21:00,700
谢谢 妈妈
Thanks, Mom.

1661
01:21:16,150 --> 01:21:18,750
我很不开心大学录取被取消的事
I'm very upset about this college thing.

1662
01:21:20,620 --> 01:21:22,250
但是我跟你爸爸可以等
But your father and I can wait

1663
01:21:22,250 --> 01:21:24,730
等到你愿意跟我们谈这事
till you're ready to talk about it.

1664
01:21:26,150 --> 01:21:27,420
谢谢
I appreciate that.

1665
01:21:30,460 --> 01:21:32,260
别忘了你的花环
Don't forget your corsage.

1666
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:36,360
好的
All right.

1667
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:44,530
我家的帅小伙
My handsome boy

1668
01:21:44,540 --> 01:21:46,170
要去舞会啦
going to prom.

1669
01:21:48,910 --> 01:21:50,910
要多拍点照片 知道吗?
Take lots of pictures, okay?

1670
01:22:09,790 --> 01:22:10,860
去霍尔基特街302号
302 Halket Street.

1671
01:22:11,390 --> 01:22:12,820
什么?
What's that?

1672
01:22:12,830 --> 01:22:14,360
我说去霍尔基特街302号
I said 302 Halket Street.

1673
01:22:14,830 --> 01:22:16,460
啊?
Huh?

1674
01:22:16,460 --> 01:22:17,860
霍尔基特街302号
302 Halket Street.

1675
01:22:17,860 --> 01:22:19,730
霍尔基特? 好的
Halket? Okay. Okay.

1676
01:22:19,730 --> 01:22:21,400
没问题 宝贝
You got it, baby.

1677
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:22,860
你爱这女孩吗?
So you love this girl?

1678
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:26,500
不 还没到那地步
Uh, no. I wouldn't go that far.

1679
01:22:26,770 --> 01:22:28,200
什么?
What?

1680
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:30,230
不 我... 不爱她
No. I... No.

1681
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:31,300
那你们会在我全新的意大利皮座椅上
Yeah, so you guys are gonna be getting busy

1682
01:22:31,300 --> 01:22:33,240
搞点小动作吗?
on my brand new Tuscan leather?

1683
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:35,270
不 我觉得
No. I think

1684
01:22:35,270 --> 01:22:36,870
我们不会的 应该不会
No, we're not. I don't think so.

1685
01:22:36,870 --> 01:22:38,810
跟你开玩笑啦
Nah, I'm just playing with you.

1686
01:22:38,810 --> 01:22:40,810
但真心希望你能有这机会
But I do hope you get some.

1687
01:22:40,810 --> 01:22:42,740
这得看她的意思
It's really gonna depend on what she wants to do.

1688
01:22:42,750 --> 01:22:43,750
不过 如果你真的爱她
If you really love her, though,

1689
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:45,310
你一定会有机会的
you definitely got a shot.

1690
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:46,680
因为她会明白你的心意
Because she'll know.

1691
01:22:47,650 --> 01:22:49,250
她人不错吧?
She is fine though?

1692
01:22:50,780 --> 01:22:51,780
啊?
Huh?

1693
01:23:11,780 --> 01:23:16,780
匹兹堡大学医学中心附属儿童医院

1694
01:23:17,780 --> 01:23:20,780
友情在劫难逃 第209日

1695
01:23:59,650 --> 01:24:00,920
我知道我看上去帅呆了
I know, I look amazing.

1696
01:24:05,850 --> 01:24:07,590
可以给你戴上花吗?
Can I put some flowers on you?

1697
01:24:22,740 --> 01:24:24,340
真不错
Like that.

1698
01:24:32,310 --> 01:24:33,470
好了
Okay.

1699
01:24:34,410 --> 01:24:37,080
在看这片子之前
Before we watch this

1700
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:39,380
我想先跟你道歉拖了这么久
I'm sorry it took so long to make.

1701
01:24:39,380 --> 01:24:41,880
不过那是因为
But the reason is

1702
01:24:41,890 --> 01:24:44,650
就是找不到办法拍得不那么烂
just couldn't figure out how to get it to not suck.

1703
01:24:46,020 --> 01:24:49,090
反正... 直到最后我们也没找着办法
But... we never really did figure it out.

1704
01:24:49,090 --> 01:24:50,520
它还是很烂
It still sucks.

1705
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:57,400
它没有完全表达出我想对你说的话
It's not exactly what I wanted to say to you.

1706
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,000
但...
But...

1707
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:08,370
不管啦
whatever.

1708
01:25:08,370 --> 01:25:10,330
让我们先看看吧 好吗?
Let's just watch this first, okay?

1709
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:25,260
要叫护士吗?
Hey, should I get a nurse?

1710
01:28:27,270 --> 01:28:29,270
蒂尼斯! 蒂尼斯!
Denise! Denise!

1711
01:29:41,770 --> 01:29:43,780
那是我与瑞秋的最后一面
That was the last time I saw Rachel.

1712
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:47,310
此后不久她便陷入了昏迷
She went into a coma shortly after that,

1713
01:29:47,310 --> 01:29:48,780
并在约十个小时后去世
and died about 10 hours later.

1714
01:29:52,050 --> 01:29:54,010
我知道我曾说过她不会死
I know I told you she doesn't die.

1715
01:29:54,680 --> 01:29:55,950
对不起
And I'm sorry.

1716
01:29:56,690 --> 01:29:58,390
内心深处...
Deep down...

1717
01:29:58,390 --> 01:30:00,950
不知怎地 我未曾想到她会死
somehow, I didn't think she would.

1718
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:03,990
然而她确是死了
But she did.

1719
01:32:59,300 --> 01:33:05,990
其余篇章结束之后篇

1720
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:32,490
亲爱的格雷戈 我听说了
Dear Greg, I heard what happened

1721
01:33:32,490 --> 01:33:33,960
你学校功课的事
with your class work.

1722
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:35,290
还有匹兹堡大学的事
And with Pitt State.

1723
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:38,160
所以 我给他们写了一封信
So, I wrote them a letter,

1724
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:40,240
想说服他们重新录取你
trying to convince them to let you back in.

1725
01:33:41,100 --> 01:33:44,230
如果你想读的话 这里有一份副本
There's a copy in here, if you want to read it.

1726
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:46,030
希望这能有用 因为那意味着
Hopefully, it works, because that would mean

1727
01:33:46,040 --> 01:33:48,970
我死后尚能发挥余热
I have powers from beyond the grave.

1728
01:33:48,970 --> 01:33:51,250
但也许你也该寄点东西过去
But you should probably send them something too.

1729
01:33:52,870 --> 01:33:56,180
再见 格雷戈 你是个难得的好朋友
Goodbye, Greg. You're a good friend.

1730
01:33:56,180 --> 01:33:57,280
但要是你不去读大学
Although if you don't go to college,

1731
01:33:57,280 --> 01:33:58,910
那你还是个傻瓜
you're also an idiot.

1732
01:33:58,910 --> 01:34:00,450
不过这一点你早就知道了
But you already knew that.

1733
01:34:01,450 --> 01:34:02,580
爱你 瑞秋
Love, Rachel.

1734
01:34:05,080 --> 01:34:08,450
另外 还想让你拿走几个我的枕头
P.S. I'd also like for you to take some of my pillows.

1735
01:34:08,450 --> 01:34:11,150
它们也会想要一个宠爱它们的家
They'll want a good home where they'll be loved.

1736
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:13,120
不是你想的那种宠爱
Not in the way you're thinking,

1737
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:14,160
那种有点恶心
that's disgusting.

1738
01:37:49,400 --> 01:37:51,640
尊敬的匹兹堡州立大学招生办:
Dear Pittsburgh State Admissions:

1739
01:37:51,640 --> 01:37:53,340
我谨代表某人写来此信
I'm writing on behalf of someone

1740
01:37:53,340 --> 01:37:55,110
在我最难相处的日子里
who gave me half a year of his life

1741
01:37:55,110 --> 01:37:56,370
他牺牲了整整半年
at the time when I was at

1742
01:37:56,370 --> 01:37:58,610
陪伴我左右
my most difficult to be around.

1743
01:37:58,610 --> 01:38:00,740
他自视甚低
He has a very low opinion of himself,

1744
01:38:00,740 --> 01:38:01,810
因此我觉得我有义务
which is why I think it's necessary

1745
01:38:01,810 --> 01:38:03,280
让你们了解到
that you hear from someone

1746
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:05,380
别人眼中真实的他:
who sees him as he actually is:

1747
01:38:05,380 --> 01:38:07,650
一个极度温柔善良 乐于付出
a limitlessly kind, sweet, giving,

1748
01:38:07,650 --> 01:38:09,680
和坦率真诚的人
and genuine person.

1749
01:38:09,680 --> 01:38:11,720
不管他会如何否认 这就是真实的他
No matter how much he would deny it.

1750
01:38:12,550 --> 01:38:14,790
这一年他学习成绩一落千丈
The drop in his academic performance this year

1751
01:38:14,790 --> 01:38:15,790
是因为他花费许多时间陪伴我
is the consequence of all the time he spent with me

1752
01:38:15,790 --> 01:38:19,690
和想方设法做东西鼓励我
and the time he spent making things for me

1753
01:38:19,690 --> 01:38:21,820
这对他也非常艰难痛苦
and how hard that was for him.

1754
01:38:21,830 --> 01:38:23,790
你们可以向他求证
You can ask him about it

1755
01:38:23,790 --> 01:38:25,830
但也许他妄自菲薄的性格
but his sort of over-the-top humility

1756
01:38:25,830 --> 01:38:27,400
又会挡住真相的道路
will probably get in the way.

1757
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:31,730
既没人能像他做如此多事来逗我开心
No one has done more to make me smile than he has.

1758
01:38:31,730 --> 01:38:33,300
也没人能让我如此开心
And no one ever could.

1759
01:38:51,490 --> 01:38:52,720
瑞秋的骨灰被撒在
Rachel's ashes were scattered
盖恩斯-杰克森电影存档

1760
01:38:52,720 --> 01:38:54,490
她家后面的公园里
in a park behind her house.
盖恩斯-杰克森电影存档

1761
01:38:54,490 --> 01:38:55,620
盖恩斯-杰克森电影存档

1762
01:38:55,620 --> 01:38:57,360
显然 她曾离家出走
Apparently, she ran away from home once
盖恩斯-杰克森电影存档

1763
01:38:57,360 --> 01:38:58,790
并想住在那公园里
and tried to live there.
盖恩斯-杰克森电影存档

1764
01:39:00,660 --> 01:39:03,630
这是她阿姨在葬礼上讲的故事
It was this story her aunt told at the funeral.

1765
01:39:03,630 --> 01:39:05,560
她想变成一只小松鼠
She was trying to become a squirrel.

1766
01:39:06,660 --> 01:39:07,830
还以为只要住在森林里
She thought she could turn into one

1767
01:39:07,830 --> 01:39:09,430
怀着极度的渴望
just by being in the forest

1768
01:39:09,430 --> 01:39:12,570
就能成功变成松鼠
and wanting it really bad.

1769
01:39:12,570 --> 01:39:15,670
我想也许这就是麦卡锡老师说的
I guess maybe that's what Mr. McCarthy meant

1770
01:39:15,670 --> 01:39:18,270
某人人生的画卷会继续展开
about someone's life continuing to unfold.

1771
01:39:19,710 --> 01:39:21,310
在瑞秋去世后还能继续了解她
It was weird to be learning something new

1772
01:39:21,310 --> 01:39:22,840
挺古怪的
about Rachel after she died.

1773
01:39:24,440 --> 01:39:26,710
但莫名的 也让我感到安心
