1
00:01:02,417 --> 00:01:04,988
<i>I have no idea
how to tell this story.</i>

2
00:01:05,817 --> 00:01:07,865
<i>I don't even know
how to start it.</i>

3
00:01:08,017 --> 00:01:10,543
<i>Like, I guess I could use
one of those classic</i>

4
00:01:10,657 --> 00:01:12,864
<i>story beginning sentences.</i>

5
00:01:13,057 --> 00:01:16,345
<i>"It was the best of times;
it was the worst of times."</i>

6
00:01:16,497 --> 00:01:18,545
<i>But what would that even mean?</i>

7
00:01:18,937 --> 00:01:20,701
<i>I mean, obviously,
somewhere in the world,</i>

8
00:01:20,857 --> 00:01:23,064
<i>it's the best of times
for someone.</i>

9
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:24,946
<i>Like he's eating all this insane</i>

10
00:01:25,057 --> 00:01:26,577
<i>Vietnamese food
he just got for free...</i>

11
00:01:26,737 --> 00:01:28,421
<i>...and the woman
who delivered the food</i>

12
00:01:28,537 --> 00:01:30,744
<i>looks exactly like the hot
girl from Pussy Riot</i>

13
00:01:30,897 --> 00:01:32,786
<i>and now she's situated
in the corner</i>

14
00:01:32,937 --> 00:01:35,258
<i>playing unspeakably
beautiful melodies on the harp.</i>

15
00:01:35,457 --> 00:01:37,221
<i>While he's just going to town
on that food.</i>

16
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:39,903
<i>So, yeah,
that's the best of times.</i>

17
00:01:40,057 --> 00:01:42,139
<i>Meanwhile, some other guy
is having</i>

18
00:01:42,217 --> 00:01:44,106
<i>his will broken
by professional torturers...</i>

19
00:01:44,297 --> 00:01:45,344
<i>...who are suspending him</i>

20
00:01:45,417 --> 00:01:47,624
<i>over a crocodile-infested
pool of acid.</i>

21
00:01:47,777 --> 00:01:49,188
<i>And because it's acid,</i>

22
00:01:49,257 --> 00:01:50,907
<i>these crocodiles
are just pissed.</i>

23
00:01:51,097 --> 00:01:53,338
<i>And they're also piping in
that gross smell you get...</i>

24
00:01:53,417 --> 00:01:55,067
<i>...when they spill
a bunch of milk</i>

25
00:01:55,137 --> 00:01:56,184
<i>in the school parking lot.</i>

26
00:01:56,337 --> 00:01:57,941
<i>And this beefy torture dude</i>

27
00:01:58,017 --> 00:02:00,019
<i>is just punching
the hell out of him.</i>

28
00:02:00,097 --> 00:02:02,338
<i>Worst of times: check.</i>

29
00:02:09,657 --> 00:02:12,501
<i>All right, look.
I'll just start.</i>

30
00:02:12,897 --> 00:02:15,104
<i>This is the story of
my senior year of high school</i>

31
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:16,588
<i>and how it destroyed my life.</i>

32
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:20,458
<i>And how I made a film so bad,
it literally killed someone.</i>

33
00:02:47,257 --> 00:02:49,259
<i>I used to think about it
this way:</i>

34
00:02:49,417 --> 00:02:52,023
<i>Schenley High School
was a world unto itself.</i>

35
00:02:52,417 --> 00:02:55,341
<i>By senior year, I had mastered
the languages and customs</i>

36
00:02:55,417 --> 00:02:56,828
<i>of its various sovereign states.</i>

37
00:02:57,497 --> 00:02:59,738
<i>The head nods of Jock Nation.</i>

38
00:02:59,897 --> 00:03:02,503
<i>The fist bumps
of the Kingdom of Stoners.</i>

39
00:03:02,657 --> 00:03:04,182
<i>The innocuous witticisms of</i>

40
00:03:04,257 --> 00:03:05,622
<i>The People's Republic
of Theater Dorks.</i>

41
00:03:05,777 --> 00:03:07,666
Greg, how was your summer?

42
00:03:07,817 --> 00:03:09,945
Summer. What does that word
even mean?

43
00:03:10,017 --> 00:03:11,701
Like, more "summ"?

44
00:03:11,777 --> 00:03:13,177
<i>In a typical high school life,</i>

45
00:03:13,217 --> 00:03:14,946
<i>you belong to one nation...</i>

46
00:03:15,137 --> 00:03:18,186
<i>...which can never
guarantee you total security.</i>

47
00:03:18,977 --> 00:03:21,059
<i>But I thought
I found a way out.</i>

48
00:03:22,057 --> 00:03:25,061
<i>Get citizenship in every nation.</i>

49
00:03:25,657 --> 00:03:27,546
<i>Get passports to everywhere.</i>

50
00:03:27,697 --> 00:03:29,984
<i>Just be on low-key
good terms with everyone...</i>

51
00:03:30,137 --> 00:03:32,185
<i>...casually interact with them
once in a while...</i>

52
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:35,147
<i>...in a way that is invisible
to everyone else.</i>

53
00:03:35,617 --> 00:03:37,221
<i>Never commit to an interaction</i>

54
00:03:37,297 --> 00:03:39,425
<i>that won't be casual or mellow.</i>

55
00:03:39,937 --> 00:03:41,462
Your test was today?

56
00:03:41,617 --> 00:03:43,426
Ugh. Tests!
I've been there.

57
00:03:43,577 --> 00:03:46,228
<i>That's like sending troops
to Afghanistan.</i>

58
00:03:46,417 --> 00:03:48,340
<i>Maintain relationships
with citizens</i>

59
00:03:48,417 --> 00:03:49,862
<i>of the most
dicked-upon nations.</i>

60
00:03:50,017 --> 00:03:52,304
<i>For example, Scott Mayhew,</i>

61
00:03:52,377 --> 00:03:54,618
<i>the gothy dork
I'm sitting next to here.</i>

62
00:03:54,777 --> 00:03:55,903
Scott, nice Berserker.

63
00:03:56,097 --> 00:03:57,223
Thank you?

64
00:03:57,377 --> 00:03:59,903
<i>It took years of cultivation
to win his trust.</i>

65
00:04:00,097 --> 00:04:01,747
<i>Yo, my name is Ill Phil</i>

66
00:04:01,817 --> 00:04:03,262
<i>I'll bend you to my will</i>

67
00:04:03,417 --> 00:04:05,863
<i>Or the universally
ostracized Ill Phil.</i>

68
00:04:05,937 --> 00:04:06,938
Yeah, that's good.

69
00:04:07,017 --> 00:04:09,145
<i>Force you to eat that pill
Now you're like, "What's the deal?"</i>

70
00:04:09,217 --> 00:04:10,742
<i>Truly a nation of one.</i>

71
00:04:10,897 --> 00:04:12,228
<i>I just got killed</i>

72
00:04:13,417 --> 00:04:16,182
<i>And there were some
places I simply couldn't go.</i>

73
00:04:16,337 --> 00:04:18,180
<i>Like the cafeteria.</i>

74
00:04:18,537 --> 00:04:21,939
<i>Every last square inch of it
was disputed territory.</i>

75
00:04:22,497 --> 00:04:24,067
<i>It was Crimea, Kashmir,</i>

76
00:04:24,137 --> 00:04:26,378
<i>and the Gaza Strip
all rolled into one.</i>

77
00:04:27,257 --> 00:04:29,988
<i>Also the part of
the Indian Ocean with pirates.</i>

78
00:04:30,577 --> 00:04:34,104
Captain Phillips pirates,
not Pirates of the Caribbean.

79
00:04:34,697 --> 00:04:37,701
<i>Although, actually, who knows?
Maybe both.</i>

80
00:04:43,857 --> 00:04:45,541
<i>Instead, I always ate lunch
in the office</i>

81
00:04:45,617 --> 00:04:46,948
<i>of my history teacher.</i>

82
00:04:47,097 --> 00:04:48,098
<i>Mr. McCarthy.</i>

83
00:04:48,257 --> 00:04:49,497
Fact:

84
00:04:49,657 --> 00:04:53,264
I'm in 309 for
the next... 20 minutes.

85
00:04:54,057 --> 00:04:56,867
<i>The only reasonable adult
in all of Schenley.</i>

86
00:04:57,017 --> 00:04:58,178
Heathens.

87
00:04:58,257 --> 00:04:59,907
Respect the research.

88
00:05:00,057 --> 00:05:01,946
<i>With Earl,
whose role in my life</i>

89
00:05:02,017 --> 00:05:04,668
<i>I'm not even gonna try to
explain to you right now.</i>

90
00:05:04,817 --> 00:05:09,220
<i>The harmony of overwhelming
and collective murder.</i>

91
00:05:09,417 --> 00:05:11,863
<i>One last thing:
hot girls destroy your life.</i>

92
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:12,938
<i>That's just a fact.</i>

93
00:05:13,097 --> 00:05:15,703
<i>It doesn't matter if the hot
girl is also a good person.</i>

94
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:18,428
<i>She's a moose,
you're a chipmunk.</i>

95
00:05:18,577 --> 00:05:20,705
<i>She's just wandering through
the forest, oblivious.</i>

96
00:05:22,097 --> 00:05:25,021
<i>And she doesn't even know that
she stomped on your head.</i>

97
00:05:27,097 --> 00:05:28,337
Hey, Madison.

98
00:05:28,497 --> 00:05:30,181
Hey, how was your summer?

99
00:05:30,337 --> 00:05:33,420
Summer. What does that word
even mean, right?

100
00:05:33,817 --> 00:05:35,546
More "summ."

101
00:05:35,817 --> 00:05:38,821
Winter, same deal.
More "wint"?

102
00:05:39,497 --> 00:05:41,306
McCarthy's in 309.

103
00:05:41,457 --> 00:05:43,186
Great, thanks.

104
00:05:43,537 --> 00:05:45,266
<i>To become humbled</i>

105
00:05:45,337 --> 00:05:47,226
<i>in front of
this overwhelming misery...</i>

106
00:05:47,417 --> 00:05:50,546
<i>...and overwhelming
fornication</i>

107
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:52,187
<i>and overwhelming lack of order.</i>

108
00:05:52,297 --> 00:05:53,344
Titties.

109
00:05:56,217 --> 00:05:57,867
Honey, can we come in?
Jesus, Jesus!

110
00:05:58,017 --> 00:05:59,781
Yeah. What do you want?

111
00:05:59,937 --> 00:06:01,817
First of all,
I was going through...

112
00:06:01,897 --> 00:06:04,025
...your stuff
and I saw that you

113
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:05,937
have not even unwrapped
your college directory.

114
00:06:06,017 --> 00:06:07,257
Mom, don't go through my stuff.

115
00:06:07,377 --> 00:06:10,381
We discussed it, and she gets
to go through your stuff.

116
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,141
Just have a look.
It's fun.

117
00:06:12,217 --> 00:06:13,298
It's like a menu
for your future.

118
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:16,188
What are you in the mood for?
Some Penn State?

119
00:06:16,337 --> 00:06:18,943
Some Pepperdine?
Pomona? Princeton?

120
00:06:19,017 --> 00:06:20,303
I'm not getting into Princeton.

121
00:06:20,377 --> 00:06:21,663
He's not getting into Princeton.

122
00:06:22,657 --> 00:06:23,943
Um, so, is that it?

123
00:06:24,097 --> 00:06:25,223
No, honey, it's not it.

124
00:06:25,377 --> 00:06:27,977
Your father and I want to talk to you
about something kind of sad.

125
00:06:31,017 --> 00:06:32,018
What?

126
00:06:36,137 --> 00:06:37,343
What happened?

127
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,818
Well, I just got off the phone
with Denise Kushner,

128
00:06:39,897 --> 00:06:42,025
Rachel's mom. You know Denise?

129
00:06:42,297 --> 00:06:43,583
Um, not really.

130
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,148
You're friends
with Rachel, though.

131
00:06:45,297 --> 00:06:46,981
Yeah, I mean,
we're like, acquainted.

132
00:06:47,497 --> 00:06:48,623
Come here.

133
00:06:50,137 --> 00:06:51,138
Okay.

134
00:06:57,177 --> 00:06:59,783
Rachel's been diagnosed
with leukemia.

135
00:07:00,057 --> 00:07:01,707
They just found out.

136
00:07:03,057 --> 00:07:04,741
Your test was today?

137
00:07:06,737 --> 00:07:08,739
Ugh. Tests! I've been there.

138
00:07:11,137 --> 00:07:12,582
Oh, God.

139
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:16,388
Is that serious?

140
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:17,698
They're doing
all kinds of tests.

141
00:07:17,777 --> 00:07:19,097
They're doing
everything they can.

142
00:07:19,257 --> 00:07:20,622
They just don't know.

143
00:07:20,777 --> 00:07:22,506
Man, that sucks.

144
00:07:22,657 --> 00:07:23,704
You're right.

145
00:07:23,857 --> 00:07:25,621
It sucks.

146
00:07:25,897 --> 00:07:27,661
It sucks really bad.

147
00:07:27,817 --> 00:07:29,819
It sucks quite a bit.

148
00:07:30,177 --> 00:07:31,178
Yeah.

149
00:07:36,897 --> 00:07:38,626
Dad, Cat Stevens is clawing me.

150
00:07:38,817 --> 00:07:40,945
Well, he's deeply distraught.

151
00:07:41,617 --> 00:07:43,267
Well, you know,
I was talking to Denise...

152
00:07:43,417 --> 00:07:45,897
...and Denise feels that
you might be someone...

153
00:07:46,057 --> 00:07:48,742
...who could make
Rachel feel better.

154
00:07:49,137 --> 00:07:50,866
Yeah, but like I said,

155
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:51,938
we're not really friends, so...

156
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:54,020
Just give Rachel a call.

157
00:07:54,777 --> 00:07:56,347
Yeah, well, what do you
want me to say?

158
00:07:56,497 --> 00:07:57,703
"Hey, it's Greg, the guy who's

159
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:58,858
"never really paid
attention to you...

160
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:01,383
"...but now you have cancer,
so let's hang out"?

161
00:08:01,497 --> 00:08:02,544
That's not gonna work.

162
00:08:02,617 --> 00:08:03,778
She'll think
you're being sarcastic.

163
00:08:03,857 --> 00:08:05,097
Are you telling me you can't do

164
00:08:05,177 --> 00:08:06,622
one nice thing
for another person?

165
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:09,223
I mean, honestly, is that
really what's happening here?

166
00:08:09,377 --> 00:08:11,027
Fine. Okay.

167
00:08:11,177 --> 00:08:13,498
Just, please don't
go through my stuff.

168
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:15,864
Or I'll start going through
your stuff.

169
00:08:16,017 --> 00:08:18,019
I hope you like tampons.

170
00:08:18,337 --> 00:08:21,625
<i>It's
Central Pittsburgh on 90.5...</i>

171
00:08:24,697 --> 00:08:26,108
<i>This is Rachel.</i>

172
00:08:26,257 --> 00:08:27,907
Hey, it's Greg Gaines.

173
00:08:28,057 --> 00:08:29,058
<i>Hi.</i>

174
00:08:30,737 --> 00:08:31,818
Yo!

175
00:08:31,977 --> 00:08:35,140
So, I called a doctor...

176
00:08:35,297 --> 00:08:38,062
...he said you needed
a prescription of Greg-acil.

177
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:39,457
<i>What's that?</i>

178
00:08:39,817 --> 00:08:40,943
Uh...

179
00:08:41,497 --> 00:08:42,862
It's me.

180
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:46,944
In convenient gel-tab form.

181
00:08:47,817 --> 00:08:48,818
<i>Oh.</i>

182
00:08:49,417 --> 00:08:50,418
Yeah.

183
00:08:52,417 --> 00:08:54,306
<i>So, I guess
you heard I'm sick.</i>

184
00:08:54,457 --> 00:08:55,458
Yeah.

185
00:08:55,617 --> 00:08:57,107
<i>Did my mom tell you?</i>

186
00:08:57,257 --> 00:08:59,737
Um, well, my mom told me.

187
00:08:59,937 --> 00:09:00,938
<i>Oh.</i>

188
00:09:01,817 --> 00:09:03,148
So, um...

189
00:09:03,617 --> 00:09:04,903
<i>What?</i>

190
00:09:05,057 --> 00:09:06,138
What?

191
00:09:06,577 --> 00:09:08,261
<i>What were you gonna say?</i>

192
00:09:08,857 --> 00:09:09,938
Um...

193
00:09:11,177 --> 00:09:12,338
<i>Greg, what?</i>

194
00:09:12,937 --> 00:09:14,302
Uh, yeah,
I was just calling to see

195
00:09:14,377 --> 00:09:16,300
if you wanted to hang out.

196
00:09:16,657 --> 00:09:17,988
<i>Right now?</i>

197
00:09:18,417 --> 00:09:20,101
Um, sure.

198
00:09:20,737 --> 00:09:22,068
<i>No, thanks.</i>

199
00:09:22,617 --> 00:09:23,698
Oh.

200
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,945
Okay, so you don't
wanna hang out?

201
00:09:26,097 --> 00:09:27,986
<i>No. Thanks anyways.</i>

202
00:09:28,857 --> 00:09:31,144
Okay. Um, bye.

203
00:09:31,497 --> 00:09:32,498
<i>Bye.</i>

204
00:09:34,217 --> 00:09:35,662
Mom, what are you doing?

205
00:09:35,817 --> 00:09:37,617
Okay, Mom, listen,
she doesn't want to see me.

206
00:09:37,657 --> 00:09:39,261
I'm sorry to be the one
to tell you, Gregory...

207
00:09:39,337 --> 00:09:40,338
...that you do not
have a choice

208
00:09:40,417 --> 00:09:41,498
in this particular matter.

209
00:09:41,577 --> 00:09:42,942
Mom, please, let me say
one thing for one second.

210
00:09:43,097 --> 00:09:44,337
You have been
given an opportunity

211
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,545
to make a very real difference
in someone's life.

212
00:09:46,737 --> 00:09:48,102
And if what you're
choosing instead

213
00:09:48,177 --> 00:09:49,178
is to lie around the house
all day...

214
00:09:49,337 --> 00:09:51,624
She doesn't want to see me!

215
00:09:51,777 --> 00:09:53,541
...I will be required
to step in...

216
00:09:53,617 --> 00:09:55,221
We're not even friends!

217
00:09:55,377 --> 00:09:57,459
...and inform you that
that is 100% unacceptable.

218
00:09:57,617 --> 00:10:00,063
Your nonstop stream of
words is making me freak out!

219
00:10:00,217 --> 00:10:01,901
And if you think that all
these excuses you're making

220
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:03,217
are in any way better...

221
00:10:03,417 --> 00:10:05,704
...or more important,
than the happiness

222
00:10:05,777 --> 00:10:06,858
of a girl with cancer...

223
00:10:07,017 --> 00:10:08,667
Mom! I am now entering
a subhuman state.

224
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:09,943
...a friend with cancer,

225
00:10:10,017 --> 00:10:12,065
you are sadly mistaken,
my friend.

226
00:10:13,337 --> 00:10:15,465
You are going to pick up
that phone.

227
00:10:15,617 --> 00:10:17,938
You're going to
call Rachel again.

228
00:10:18,097 --> 00:10:20,464
You are going to.
You are going to.

229
00:10:48,817 --> 00:10:50,546
Oh, Greg.

230
00:10:52,497 --> 00:10:54,420
Oh, Mrs. Kushner.

231
00:10:54,857 --> 00:10:56,347
Denise, Greg.

232
00:10:56,977 --> 00:10:59,025
To you, I'm Denise, okay?

233
00:10:59,177 --> 00:11:00,986
Oh, okay. Good.

234
00:11:01,137 --> 00:11:03,458
You're a real good kid,
you know that?

235
00:11:03,617 --> 00:11:06,268
You really are.
You just have a big heart.

236
00:11:07,137 --> 00:11:09,219
You're kind, nice.

237
00:11:11,217 --> 00:11:13,185
I really appreciate it.

238
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:15,418
Thank you.

239
00:11:17,497 --> 00:11:19,977
Good, good, good, good, good...

240
00:11:21,937 --> 00:11:22,938
...good boy.

241
00:11:23,097 --> 00:11:24,098
Okay.

242
00:11:24,257 --> 00:11:27,500
You really are kind,
big-hearted, delicious...

243
00:11:27,737 --> 00:11:30,104
...yummy, yummy, young boy.

244
00:11:31,217 --> 00:11:33,663
And you're so, so, handsome.

245
00:11:33,817 --> 00:11:36,548
Oh, I'm not handsome,
but thank you.

246
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:38,665
And so modest.

247
00:11:39,057 --> 00:11:40,218
I guess I'm a modest mouse.

248
00:11:42,377 --> 00:11:44,744
Greg, where do you come up
with this stuff?

249
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:47,258
Well, that's the name
of a band, actually.

250
00:11:47,337 --> 00:11:48,748
Oh.
Yeah.

251
00:11:49,817 --> 00:11:50,943
Rachel!

252
00:11:51,097 --> 00:11:54,340
I've got a modest little mouse
here to see you!

253
00:11:54,977 --> 00:11:55,978
Rachel.

254
00:11:56,137 --> 00:11:58,026
Greg, what are you doing here?

255
00:11:59,097 --> 00:12:00,223
So, uh...

256
00:12:01,097 --> 00:12:02,542
...the doctor
really recommends

257
00:12:02,617 --> 00:12:04,585
a strong dosage of Gregitor.

258
00:12:04,817 --> 00:12:06,421
You already used that joke.

259
00:12:06,577 --> 00:12:07,578
No.

260
00:12:08,417 --> 00:12:10,704
No, 'cause last time
it was about Greg-acil...

261
00:12:10,857 --> 00:12:13,747
...which if you recall comes
in convenient gel-tab form.

262
00:12:13,897 --> 00:12:16,104
Look, I don't want you
hanging out with me.

263
00:12:16,177 --> 00:12:17,588
I don't need your stupid pity.

264
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:18,817
It's fine, you can just go.

265
00:12:18,857 --> 00:12:19,904
No, no.

266
00:12:20,017 --> 00:12:22,418
You got it all wrong. I'm not
here 'cause I pity you.

267
00:12:22,577 --> 00:12:25,660
I'm actually here
because my mom is making me.

268
00:12:26,857 --> 00:12:28,461
That's actually worse.

269
00:12:28,617 --> 00:12:30,107
Yeah, I know.

270
00:12:30,257 --> 00:12:33,579
Look, it's okay. Honestly,
I'm fine. Just... just go.

271
00:12:33,777 --> 00:12:36,701
Okay, Rachel, just listen
to me for a second.

272
00:12:37,417 --> 00:12:40,102
My mom is gonna turn my life
into a living hell...

273
00:12:40,257 --> 00:12:42,225
...if I don't hang out
with you.

274
00:12:42,377 --> 00:12:45,540
I can't overstate how annoying
she's being about this.

275
00:12:45,897 --> 00:12:49,026
She's basically like
the LeBron James of nagging.

276
00:12:50,897 --> 00:12:52,308
LeBron James plays basketball.

277
00:12:52,377 --> 00:12:53,822
I know who LeBron James is.

278
00:12:54,657 --> 00:12:57,467
Look, I know I'm not doing you
any favors here.

279
00:12:57,737 --> 00:12:59,978
What I'm asking is for you
to do me a favor.

280
00:13:00,177 --> 00:13:01,224
You want a favor from me?

281
00:13:01,377 --> 00:13:02,424
Yes.

282
00:13:02,577 --> 00:13:05,148
Just let me hang out
with you for one day.

283
00:13:05,297 --> 00:13:06,822
I could tell my mom
we hung out

284
00:13:06,937 --> 00:13:09,861
and then we'll just be
out of each other's lives.

285
00:13:10,297 --> 00:13:11,537
Deal?

286
00:13:13,577 --> 00:13:14,703
Deal.

287
00:13:15,177 --> 00:13:16,338
Word.

288
00:13:16,737 --> 00:13:19,058
Is that a Black Power salute?

289
00:13:19,217 --> 00:13:20,707
No, I was going in
for a fist bump.

290
00:13:20,857 --> 00:13:22,018
I can't fist bump you
from up here.

291
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:24,305
Yeah, I realize that.

292
00:13:39,937 --> 00:13:41,098
Books.

293
00:13:41,777 --> 00:13:42,778
Nice.

294
00:13:46,497 --> 00:13:47,658
And, uh...

295
00:13:49,097 --> 00:13:50,667
...tree wallpaper.

296
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,828
That's good.

297
00:13:53,137 --> 00:13:54,138
Why?

298
00:13:55,057 --> 00:13:56,263
I don't know.

299
00:14:23,777 --> 00:14:25,620
There's a lot of pillows
in here.

300
00:14:27,337 --> 00:14:28,384
Mmm-hmm.

301
00:14:29,057 --> 00:14:32,743
Seriously, like, how many...
how many pillows is that?

302
00:14:33,857 --> 00:14:35,097
I don't know.

303
00:14:35,897 --> 00:14:37,899
I wish I had
that many pillows.

304
00:14:38,137 --> 00:14:41,266
So, ask your parents for some.

305
00:14:41,617 --> 00:14:44,427
No, they'd be suspicious
or something.

306
00:14:45,497 --> 00:14:47,499
What, that you'd sleep
all the time?

307
00:14:47,657 --> 00:14:49,341
No. Probably assume

308
00:14:49,457 --> 00:14:51,425
I was gonna masturbate
all over them.

309
00:14:52,337 --> 00:14:54,499
They just have
some gross ideas about me.

310
00:14:54,577 --> 00:14:55,578
But that's on them.

311
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:59,304
They're always getting
sexy pillows.

312
00:15:01,017 --> 00:15:02,223
This is a nice pillow.

313
00:15:02,297 --> 00:15:03,298
This pillow is a dude,
obviously...

314
00:15:03,457 --> 00:15:04,817
...but it reminds me
of this pillow

315
00:15:04,857 --> 00:15:06,427
we used to have named Francesca.

316
00:15:06,817 --> 00:15:08,228
They have a similar coloring.

317
00:15:08,377 --> 00:15:10,186
Anyway, Francesca,
we had to eventually

318
00:15:10,257 --> 00:15:12,225
give away because in the end...

319
00:15:12,377 --> 00:15:14,857
...that whole situation
was just a real problem.

320
00:15:14,937 --> 00:15:16,382
It was a mess.

321
00:15:16,537 --> 00:15:18,505
There was a real chemistry

322
00:15:18,577 --> 00:15:21,308
between us both that
I think no one could deny.

323
00:15:22,017 --> 00:15:23,701
I know the world may have
thought it was wrong...

324
00:15:23,857 --> 00:15:26,667
...but I think, personally,
the world was wrong...

325
00:15:26,817 --> 00:15:29,058
...about what
could be between...

326
00:15:30,217 --> 00:15:32,743
...a pillow, and a boy...

327
00:15:33,617 --> 00:15:35,187
...who became a man.

328
00:15:39,017 --> 00:15:40,621
Or whatever. I'm just...

329
00:15:41,257 --> 00:15:42,861
...trying to be funny.

330
00:15:43,017 --> 00:15:45,861
No, that was good.
Thank you.

331
00:15:48,777 --> 00:15:49,983
Oh, shit.

332
00:15:54,017 --> 00:15:55,621
I actually have to go.

333
00:15:55,937 --> 00:15:57,621
That's okay. Who was that?

334
00:15:57,817 --> 00:16:00,263
Sorry. Uh, that was Earl.

335
00:16:00,337 --> 00:16:01,338
Oh, who's Earl?

336
00:16:03,297 --> 00:16:05,379
<i>You may remember Earl
from 15 minutes ago.</i>

337
00:16:05,577 --> 00:16:06,578
Titties.

338
00:16:06,737 --> 00:16:08,819
<i>So, some people think
Earl is my friend,</i>

339
00:16:08,897 --> 00:16:09,978
<i>but he's really not.</i>

340
00:16:10,057 --> 00:16:11,661
<i>He's more like a coworker.</i>

341
00:16:11,817 --> 00:16:13,228
<i>I've known him
since kindergarten.</i>

342
00:16:13,417 --> 00:16:15,738
<i>His house is
a short walk from mine,</i>

343
00:16:15,817 --> 00:16:17,421
<i>but in a much
tougher neighborhood.</i>

344
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:20,899
<i>His dad is in Texas, his mom
is a depressed shut-in.</i>

345
00:16:21,057 --> 00:16:23,105
<i>And his brother
Derrick's dog Doopie</i>

346
00:16:23,257 --> 00:16:25,146
<i>will definitely eat me someday.</i>

347
00:16:27,257 --> 00:16:29,305
Doopie, Doopie, chill!

348
00:16:34,017 --> 00:16:36,861
<i>So over the years we've
mostly hung out at my place.</i>

349
00:16:37,017 --> 00:16:40,305
<i>Usually with my dad,
a tenured sociology professor.</i>

350
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:42,744
What you got, cat?
You wanna fight?

351
00:16:42,897 --> 00:16:45,025
Didn't think so, punk-ass cat.

352
00:16:45,177 --> 00:16:47,020
- Boys!
<i>- His job allows him</i>

353
00:16:47,097 --> 00:16:48,617
<i>to be frequently at home
doing nothing.</i>

354
00:16:48,657 --> 00:16:50,580
You'll want to pay
close attention to this.

355
00:16:50,737 --> 00:16:53,707
The insane conquistador,
Aguirre,

356
00:16:53,777 --> 00:16:55,017
is raging through the jungle...

357
00:16:55,177 --> 00:16:58,147
...in search of a golden city
that doesn't exist.

358
00:16:58,337 --> 00:16:59,463
<i>The wrath of God.</i>

359
00:16:59,617 --> 00:17:02,382
It's a classic
of foreign cinema.

360
00:17:02,537 --> 00:17:04,266
<i>Who else is with me?</i>

361
00:17:05,497 --> 00:17:07,181
<i>In addition to the best films...</i>

362
00:17:07,257 --> 00:17:08,383
This is cuttlefish.

363
00:17:08,537 --> 00:17:10,221
<i>...my house also has
the weirdest food.</i>

364
00:17:10,377 --> 00:17:12,345
A sea creature
much like a squid.

365
00:17:12,417 --> 00:17:14,704
It is a favorite East Asian
snack food.

366
00:17:14,857 --> 00:17:16,985
<i>Obviously we come from
pretty different backgrounds.</i>

367
00:17:17,137 --> 00:17:19,458
<i>But somehow, we like
most of the same things.</i>

368
00:17:19,617 --> 00:17:22,427
Yes, its smell is
odd and repellent

369
00:17:22,497 --> 00:17:23,862
to our Western noses.

370
00:17:24,017 --> 00:17:26,019
<i>And we learned pretty early on</i>

371
00:17:26,097 --> 00:17:27,617
<i>that we were the only ones
who liked...</i>

372
00:17:27,657 --> 00:17:30,945
<i>...for example,
classics of foreign cinema.</i>

373
00:17:32,057 --> 00:17:33,937
<i>Why did we like them?</i>

374
00:17:33,977 --> 00:17:35,388
<i>It's hard to say.</i>

375
00:17:35,577 --> 00:17:37,739
<i>Maybe it's that they were
weird and often violent,</i>

376
00:17:37,817 --> 00:17:38,978
<i>like us.</i>

377
00:17:39,137 --> 00:17:41,663
<i>Or confusing and possibly
meaningless, like life.</i>

378
00:17:41,817 --> 00:17:44,468
<i>You can't escape of
this stinkin' camp</i>

379
00:17:44,537 --> 00:17:45,743
<i>because you never know
when they call you.</i>

380
00:17:45,897 --> 00:17:47,103
<i>Because you have to be here</i>

381
00:17:47,217 --> 00:17:49,584
<i>because you're paid for,
you're under contract.</i>

382
00:17:51,697 --> 00:17:53,779
<i>Anyway,
we liked them so much</i>

383
00:17:53,857 --> 00:17:55,063
<i>we started making our own.</i>

384
00:17:56,217 --> 00:17:57,218
<i>Action!</i>

385
00:17:57,377 --> 00:17:59,061
<i>The idea behind
each one was...</i>

386
00:17:59,217 --> 00:18:00,417
<i>...we took a film
that we liked</i>

387
00:18:00,457 --> 00:18:02,027
<i>and made the title stupider.</i>

388
00:18:02,177 --> 00:18:03,383
<i>And then made a new film</i>

389
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:04,902
<i>to reflect the new stupid title.</i>

390
00:18:05,057 --> 00:18:07,057
<i>It's a formula that only
produces horrible films...</i>

391
00:18:07,177 --> 00:18:09,544
<i>...but for some reason
we keep using it.</i>

392
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,146
<i>We've made 42 films.</i>

393
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,185
<i>You'd think we'd have stopped
making them by now.</i>

394
00:18:57,337 --> 00:18:58,577
<i>But we haven't.</i>

395
00:18:58,897 --> 00:19:00,308
<i>Honestly, it's like
you can't go anywhere.</i>

396
00:19:00,497 --> 00:19:03,068
<i>You can't escape
this stinking place...</i>

397
00:19:03,217 --> 00:19:05,060
<i>...because you don't know
when they call you...</i>

398
00:19:05,217 --> 00:19:06,343
<i>...'cause you're on contract</i>

399
00:19:06,417 --> 00:19:08,784
<i>and you're paid to be here,
it's bullshit.</i>

400
00:19:08,937 --> 00:19:10,507
<i>Yeah, and it's like, you know,</i>

401
00:19:10,577 --> 00:19:12,545
<i>I can't do anything.
I'm not a free person.</i>

402
00:19:12,697 --> 00:19:15,860
Truly, one of my favorites
from your oeuvre.

403
00:19:16,497 --> 00:19:19,341
A mature investigation
into the nature of violence.

404
00:19:19,497 --> 00:19:21,738
Dad, for like
the billionth time,

405
00:19:21,817 --> 00:19:23,501
you're not allowed
to watch these.

406
00:19:24,417 --> 00:19:26,101
I'm a fan.

407
00:19:27,857 --> 00:19:29,905
You gonna go see
that girl again?

408
00:19:31,097 --> 00:19:33,225
I mean, probably, yeah.

409
00:19:33,377 --> 00:19:34,981
You gonna play
with them titties?

410
00:19:35,137 --> 00:19:37,583
No. It's not like that.

411
00:19:37,737 --> 00:19:38,738
Well, that's not right.

412
00:19:38,897 --> 00:19:40,740
I mean, this could be
her last chance on Earth

413
00:19:40,817 --> 00:19:41,978
to be with a man.

414
00:19:42,137 --> 00:19:43,502
Don't make this about you.

415
00:19:43,657 --> 00:19:44,658
Earl!

416
00:19:45,457 --> 00:19:47,459
First of all,
if it's that high-stakes,

417
00:19:47,537 --> 00:19:49,665
probably won't even be able
to get a boner.

418
00:19:50,497 --> 00:19:52,784
Did I even say shit
about boners?

419
00:19:52,937 --> 00:19:53,984
No.

420
00:19:54,657 --> 00:19:58,742
What kind of cancer even is
acute myelogenous leukemia?

421
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:02,228
You know, cancer of the, uh...

422
00:20:03,217 --> 00:20:04,787
...the thing.

423
00:20:06,097 --> 00:20:07,303
<i>It's bullshit!</i>

424
00:20:08,017 --> 00:20:11,100
The Battle of Antietam was
the bloodiest day

425
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:12,817
in American history.

426
00:20:13,017 --> 00:20:14,940
Class, what do you have to
say for yourselves?

427
00:20:15,097 --> 00:20:16,137
Respect the research.

428
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:19,578
That is what
I'm talking about!

429
00:20:19,737 --> 00:20:21,262
All right,
run for your lives.

430
00:20:21,337 --> 00:20:23,465
Save yourselves.
Go, go, go, go, go.

431
00:20:23,897 --> 00:20:25,387
Good work today, everybody.

432
00:20:25,897 --> 00:20:28,628
Way to go. Bam.
Love it. Good stuff.

433
00:20:28,777 --> 00:20:30,461
Good job.
Excellent work today.

434
00:20:30,617 --> 00:20:32,540
Excellent. Nice job.
Hey, can I talk to you?

435
00:20:32,697 --> 00:20:33,778
Can I talk to you for a second?

436
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:35,222
Sure, Greg, what's up?

437
00:20:35,697 --> 00:20:39,418
Uh, do you know
any facts about leukemia?

438
00:20:39,577 --> 00:20:40,578
Leukemia?

439
00:20:40,737 --> 00:20:45,425
Yeah, it's a cancer of the
blood and/or bone marrow.

440
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:46,578
Why?

441
00:20:46,737 --> 00:20:49,183
Right, so it's pretty
spread out in the body?

442
00:20:49,337 --> 00:20:50,862
That is a fact, yes.

443
00:20:51,017 --> 00:20:53,304
How soon do people die from it?

444
00:20:53,457 --> 00:20:55,425
I think it's often
pretty treatable, bud.

445
00:20:55,497 --> 00:20:56,623
Why do you ask?

446
00:20:56,697 --> 00:20:59,780
Well, you know Rachel Kushner
has leukemia, right?

447
00:20:59,937 --> 00:21:01,268
Wait, Rachel has what?

448
00:21:01,937 --> 00:21:04,178
I'm, like,
innovatively stupid.

449
00:21:05,657 --> 00:21:08,058
Everyone was gonna find out
sooner or later.

450
00:21:08,217 --> 00:21:10,538
Just hate having to share
everything about myself.

451
00:21:10,697 --> 00:21:11,937
I'm the exact same way.

452
00:21:12,577 --> 00:21:14,500
You know,
one thing you can do

453
00:21:14,577 --> 00:21:15,817
if you don't want to
talk to anyone...

454
00:21:15,897 --> 00:21:17,740
...is just enter
a subhuman state.

455
00:21:19,937 --> 00:21:21,746
Here, pretend you're
someone annoying.

456
00:21:29,457 --> 00:21:30,663
"Hi, Rachel.

457
00:21:30,737 --> 00:21:32,102
"I'm really sorry
you have cancer."

458
00:21:46,217 --> 00:21:47,503
Does that ever work?

459
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:50,901
Yeah, of course.
It works all the time.

460
00:21:51,137 --> 00:21:53,060
It's called passive resistance.

461
00:21:53,257 --> 00:21:55,385
You know, that's what Gandhi
was all about.

462
00:21:55,537 --> 00:21:57,904
I'm pretty sure Gandhi
never did the subhuman thing.

463
00:21:58,337 --> 00:21:59,862
Yeah, he did.

464
00:22:00,657 --> 00:22:03,706
That's how India achieved
statehood. Here, try it.

465
00:22:07,657 --> 00:22:08,783
Nope.

466
00:22:08,977 --> 00:22:10,103
Come on, it's easy.

467
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:15,221
Okay. Or another thing
you can do is just

468
00:22:15,297 --> 00:22:16,947
flat-out pretend to be dead.

469
00:22:18,137 --> 00:22:19,980
Say something annoying to me.

470
00:22:20,057 --> 00:22:21,058
Um...

471
00:22:22,497 --> 00:22:24,386
"Hey, Rachel. I just want you
to remember

472
00:22:24,497 --> 00:22:26,898
"that your cancer
is all part of God's plan."

473
00:22:33,377 --> 00:22:35,027
<i>Hey, asshole.</i>

474
00:22:35,177 --> 00:22:36,827
<i>Yeah, over here.</i>

475
00:22:37,457 --> 00:22:38,788
<i>Just so
we're straight on this,</i>

476
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,461
<i>you're advising
a girl with cancer...</i>

477
00:22:40,617 --> 00:22:42,984
<i>...to pretend to be dead.</i>

478
00:22:44,057 --> 00:22:45,183
<i>No, seriously.</i>

479
00:22:45,257 --> 00:22:47,017
<i>Think about what you're
doing here, dickhead.</i>

480
00:22:47,097 --> 00:22:48,861
<i>I've been doing
my broody Wolverine face on</i>

481
00:22:48,977 --> 00:22:49,978
<i>this girl's wall...</i>

482
00:22:50,137 --> 00:22:51,662
<i>...for five
and a quarter years,</i>

483
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:53,148
<i>and at this point, I'm
probably only still here...</i>

484
00:22:53,297 --> 00:22:54,901
<i>...because she'd feel
weirdly guilty</i>

485
00:22:54,977 --> 00:22:56,263
<i>or disloyal taking me down.</i>

486
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,146
<i>But I'm goddamned if I'm letting</i>

487
00:22:58,217 --> 00:22:59,737
<i>a little punk like you
waltz in here...</i>

488
00:22:59,777 --> 00:23:01,063
<i>...stupiding up the place!</i>

489
00:23:01,217 --> 00:23:02,378
<i>Not on my watch, pal.</i>

490
00:23:02,537 --> 00:23:03,823
Greg, what's wrong?

491
00:23:05,977 --> 00:23:07,581
I'm really sorry.

492
00:23:08,697 --> 00:23:10,577
I shouldn't have told you
to pretend to be dead.

493
00:23:10,617 --> 00:23:12,506
That was really insensitive.

494
00:23:13,497 --> 00:23:15,101
I mean, I'm sick.
I'm not dying.

495
00:23:15,297 --> 00:23:17,379
Yeah, I know, but I just...

496
00:23:17,537 --> 00:23:19,266
Now I'm being
all weird about it.

497
00:23:19,417 --> 00:23:21,943
And I can't get un-weird,
'cause I just...

498
00:23:22,137 --> 00:23:23,343
Despite what you said,

499
00:23:23,417 --> 00:23:25,057
I'm clearly still
sitting here thinking...

500
00:23:25,097 --> 00:23:26,897
..."death, death, death,
death, death, death."

501
00:23:39,537 --> 00:23:42,017
That's exactly
what I'm talking about!

502
00:23:44,217 --> 00:23:46,424
<i>So if this was
a touching romantic story...</i>

503
00:23:46,617 --> 00:23:48,142
<i>...this is probably
where a new feeling</i>

504
00:23:48,217 --> 00:23:49,218
<i>would wash over me...</i>

505
00:23:49,377 --> 00:23:50,503
<i>...and our eyes would meet</i>

506
00:23:50,577 --> 00:23:52,261
<i>and suddenly we would be
furiously making out...</i>

507
00:23:52,457 --> 00:23:54,141
<i>...with the fire
of a thousand suns.</i>

508
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:01,065
<i>But this isn't
a touching romantic story.</i>

509
00:24:01,257 --> 00:24:02,418
Anyway...
Yep.

510
00:24:02,817 --> 00:24:05,024
<i>But we did
still become friends.</i>

511
00:24:12,137 --> 00:24:14,265
Daniel Craig's thing is,
he's got an accent, right?

512
00:24:14,417 --> 00:24:17,148
So he's used to talking with
his mouth in a weird shape...

513
00:24:17,297 --> 00:24:19,345
...which is why he has
pouty lips, like a woman.

514
00:24:19,537 --> 00:24:22,347
Lickable technology, like,
I could text you a sandwich.

515
00:24:22,497 --> 00:24:23,658
I think that's where phones
are headed.

516
00:24:23,817 --> 00:24:26,787
There's a button on the nape
of his neck, under the skin.

517
00:24:26,937 --> 00:24:28,826
Just push it
if you want him to stop.

518
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:31,379
Do you believe animals
just live in our house,

519
00:24:31,497 --> 00:24:33,022
and everyone's cool with it?

520
00:24:33,177 --> 00:24:34,906
Like, real animals?

521
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:37,424
Anyway. You talk now.

522
00:24:37,817 --> 00:24:39,819
You mean, talk about cancer?

523
00:24:39,977 --> 00:24:41,627
Only if you want to.

524
00:24:42,217 --> 00:24:43,946
The hardest part is
watching my mom

525
00:24:44,017 --> 00:24:45,428
trying to deal with it all.

526
00:24:45,497 --> 00:24:48,467
And sometimes, I mean,
I do think if it ends up

527
00:24:48,537 --> 00:24:50,699
that she's alone
in that house...

528
00:24:50,857 --> 00:24:52,700
She has no one.
She and my dad hate each other.

529
00:24:52,777 --> 00:24:54,267
She has no siblings.

530
00:24:54,417 --> 00:24:56,146
I don't know what she'd do.

531
00:24:58,257 --> 00:24:59,543
Don't cry.

532
00:24:59,697 --> 00:25:01,187
I'm not crying.

533
00:25:01,817 --> 00:25:04,024
Right, well, you know,
you can cry if you need to.

534
00:25:04,177 --> 00:25:05,986
I thought you said,
"Don't cry."

535
00:25:06,057 --> 00:25:07,468
Um...

536
00:25:08,857 --> 00:25:10,586
Me and my dad used to
walk around the block

537
00:25:10,657 --> 00:25:12,261
and count squirrels.

538
00:25:12,737 --> 00:25:14,617
Why? Did he work for, like,
the squirrel census?

539
00:25:14,737 --> 00:25:16,102
No, it was just something we did

540
00:25:16,177 --> 00:25:18,384
when it was time for us
to spend time together.

541
00:25:18,537 --> 00:25:19,902
We didn't even say anything
while we did it.

542
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:21,627
All we'd say was stuff like:

543
00:25:21,777 --> 00:25:24,542
"Squirrel, seven."
"Two squirrels, nine."

544
00:25:24,697 --> 00:25:28,588
Jesus. You need to apply
for a dad refund immediately.

545
00:25:28,737 --> 00:25:29,817
What group am I in?

546
00:25:29,937 --> 00:25:30,938
What?

547
00:25:31,137 --> 00:25:32,821
Yesterday you were
saying you'd mapped out

548
00:25:32,897 --> 00:25:34,177
the entire high school by group.

549
00:25:34,297 --> 00:25:35,537
What's my group?

550
00:25:35,697 --> 00:25:37,540
Seriously?
Yeah.

551
00:25:37,697 --> 00:25:41,144
Boring Jewish Senior Girls,
Subgroup 2-A.

552
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:44,137
Please appreciate
how honest I was just now.

553
00:25:44,177 --> 00:25:45,178
You're an asshole.

554
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:47,941
What group are you in?

555
00:25:48,097 --> 00:25:50,987
Uh, I'm not
in a group, actually.

556
00:25:51,137 --> 00:25:54,266
I just wouldn't belong to
a group that doesn't suck.

557
00:25:54,857 --> 00:25:57,463
You know,
I'm terminally awkward

558
00:25:57,537 --> 00:25:59,539
and I have a face
like a little groundhog.

559
00:25:59,617 --> 00:26:00,664
So...

560
00:26:00,737 --> 00:26:02,705
You can't really think that.

561
00:26:03,297 --> 00:26:04,981
No, I don't think that.

562
00:26:05,217 --> 00:26:06,548
I know that.

563
00:26:06,897 --> 00:26:10,583
I just feel like, you know,
for a kid like me...

564
00:26:11,577 --> 00:26:14,820
...in high school,
best case scenario,

565
00:26:14,897 --> 00:26:16,422
just... survive. You know?

566
00:26:16,577 --> 00:26:19,262
Survive without creating
any mortal enemies...

567
00:26:19,417 --> 00:26:21,897
...or hideously embarrassing
yourself forever.

568
00:26:22,057 --> 00:26:24,059
Just survive until college?

569
00:26:24,217 --> 00:26:27,585
College? No. God, college is
going to be even worse.

570
00:26:27,857 --> 00:26:28,858
What?

571
00:26:29,017 --> 00:26:31,623
I mean, at least high school,
it's over at 3:00...

572
00:26:31,777 --> 00:26:34,747
...and it's kids
I mostly know by now.

573
00:26:34,897 --> 00:26:36,777
But college is just gonna be
non-stop strangers.

574
00:26:36,857 --> 00:26:38,302
And some of them
even live in your room.

575
00:26:38,417 --> 00:26:40,579
It's like you can
literally never relax.

576
00:26:40,737 --> 00:26:43,661
I see myself dying of
a panic attack two weeks in.

577
00:26:44,417 --> 00:26:45,862
I might just not apply.

578
00:26:46,017 --> 00:26:48,702
That's the dumbest thing
I've ever heard you say.

579
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,258
It's probably not even top five.

580
00:26:52,017 --> 00:26:54,827
And, you know,
high school, college,

581
00:26:54,897 --> 00:26:56,262
we're forced to spend
these years of our lives...

582
00:26:56,417 --> 00:26:58,385
...in randomly selected
groups of people

583
00:26:58,457 --> 00:27:00,221
that we have nothing
in common with.

584
00:27:00,377 --> 00:27:01,867
It's a nightmare.

585
00:27:02,457 --> 00:27:04,903
Anyone who says otherwise
is lying.

586
00:27:06,137 --> 00:27:07,138
Congratulations, Greg.

587
00:27:07,297 --> 00:27:08,458
Tomorrow,
you're eating lunch with

588
00:27:08,537 --> 00:27:11,381
Boring Jewish Senior Girls,
Subgroup 2-A.

589
00:27:14,897 --> 00:27:16,308
So where do you usually sit?

590
00:27:18,377 --> 00:27:21,301
It's literally like we're trying
to have lunch in Kandahar.

591
00:27:24,857 --> 00:27:28,225
Rachel, we just found out the
theme for this year's prom:

592
00:27:28,377 --> 00:27:30,027
"A Knight to Remember."

593
00:27:30,217 --> 00:27:31,901
Knight with a Medieval prom!

594
00:27:32,057 --> 00:27:34,378
Isn't prom like six months away?

595
00:27:34,537 --> 00:27:35,538
Hi, guys. This is Greg,

596
00:27:35,617 --> 00:27:37,540
he's gonna be
sitting with us today.

597
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:40,428
Anybody need any spoons? No?

598
00:27:42,657 --> 00:27:43,863
Hello.

599
00:27:45,657 --> 00:27:48,627
So, Greg, why are you
sitting with us today?

600
00:27:48,817 --> 00:27:50,785
You know, it's lunch.

601
00:27:50,937 --> 00:27:53,019
You gotta eat somewhere.
Can't stand and eat.

602
00:27:53,137 --> 00:27:56,664
You and Rachel seem very
friendly, all of a sudden.

603
00:27:56,817 --> 00:27:58,148
Yeah.

604
00:27:58,217 --> 00:28:00,177
You're only talking to her
because she has cancer.

605
00:28:00,217 --> 00:28:01,218
What?

606
00:28:01,297 --> 00:28:03,459
Greg, you hung out
with Rachel once.

607
00:28:03,617 --> 00:28:05,267
You're befriending her to
feel good about yourself.

608
00:28:05,457 --> 00:28:06,697
No, I'm not.

609
00:28:06,857 --> 00:28:07,858
Who even does that?

610
00:28:11,737 --> 00:28:12,738
You guys mind
if I sit with you?

611
00:28:12,817 --> 00:28:13,818
Of course not.

612
00:28:16,377 --> 00:28:17,663
Sorry, it's a...

613
00:28:17,817 --> 00:28:19,467
It's a pillow.
It's meant to be a baby,

614
00:28:19,537 --> 00:28:20,868
for health class.

615
00:28:21,257 --> 00:28:22,463
You think it's safe here?

616
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:23,823
A pillow?

617
00:28:24,897 --> 00:28:26,103
Greg, what do you think?

618
00:28:26,457 --> 00:28:27,663
Mmm, I don't know.

619
00:28:27,857 --> 00:28:29,188
Better not get it
too close to me,

620
00:28:29,257 --> 00:28:31,942
otherwise I might just
masturbate onto it.

621
00:28:32,897 --> 00:28:34,945
Ew, Greg,
that's just weird and gross.

622
00:28:39,777 --> 00:28:40,778
Hey, everyone,

623
00:28:40,857 --> 00:28:42,939
check out Scott Mayhew's
Tyrannosaurus walk.

624
00:28:43,097 --> 00:28:45,418
It's a great way to get
from point A to point B.

625
00:28:46,017 --> 00:28:47,382
That was really mean, Greg.

626
00:28:47,537 --> 00:28:49,027
I think he heard you.

627
00:28:55,137 --> 00:28:56,707
<i>And just like that...</i>

628
00:28:58,057 --> 00:29:00,059
<i>...eight years
of carefully-cultivated</i>

629
00:29:00,137 --> 00:29:02,458
<i>invisibility... gone.</i>

630
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:04,618
Fin.

631
00:29:05,697 --> 00:29:07,461
Your mom made cookies?

632
00:29:07,617 --> 00:29:10,905
Nah, I won them off
of Ill Phil in a game of tonk.

633
00:29:11,377 --> 00:29:13,857
Got tired of whooping
your sorry ass.

634
00:29:14,297 --> 00:29:16,538
Why do they even call it
Scholar Horizons Biology?

635
00:29:16,737 --> 00:29:20,139
Maybe they should call it
Scholar Horizons Tonk.

636
00:29:20,297 --> 00:29:21,901
Or Sometimes Paper Football.

637
00:29:22,057 --> 00:29:23,388
Heathens.

638
00:29:23,577 --> 00:29:25,147
What up?
Hi, Mr. McCarthy.

639
00:29:26,817 --> 00:29:27,818
Wow.

640
00:29:28,737 --> 00:29:32,025
Earl, fact,
that lunch is garbage.

641
00:29:32,177 --> 00:29:35,340
You're literally poisoning
yourself right in front of us.

642
00:29:35,617 --> 00:29:37,426
At least I ain't eating
no funky ass

643
00:29:37,497 --> 00:29:39,659
seaweed-looking tentacle soup.

644
00:29:39,977 --> 00:29:42,742
Seriously, this stuff
is the business.

645
00:29:42,897 --> 00:29:45,059
It's Vietnamese.
It's called Pho.

646
00:29:45,137 --> 00:29:46,901
It is "Pho-nomenal."

647
00:29:47,057 --> 00:29:48,582
Well, let me try some one time.

648
00:29:48,737 --> 00:29:49,738
Mmm.

649
00:29:50,817 --> 00:29:52,581
Now you want to try some?
Yeah.

650
00:29:52,777 --> 00:29:53,858
Well, no.

651
00:29:54,017 --> 00:29:56,463
It's strictly forbidden for me
to give you food.

652
00:29:56,657 --> 00:29:58,102
However, if you go to...

653
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,903
...Thuyen's Super
Saigon Flavor

654
00:30:01,977 --> 00:30:03,308
over in Lawrenceville...

655
00:30:03,497 --> 00:30:04,908
...and ask for Thuyen.

656
00:30:05,057 --> 00:30:08,220
Tell him to put it on my tab.
You'll be all set.

657
00:30:10,817 --> 00:30:13,138
I ain't going to
no damn Lawrenceville.

658
00:30:13,457 --> 00:30:14,902
Fair enough.

659
00:30:16,977 --> 00:30:18,866
You'll have to excuse me.

660
00:30:22,337 --> 00:30:23,384
Boys.

661
00:30:23,537 --> 00:30:25,141
Respect the research.

662
00:30:25,297 --> 00:30:26,298
Respect!

663
00:30:33,137 --> 00:30:34,901
God! You know,
people just assume that

664
00:30:34,977 --> 00:30:36,388
Rachel and I are dating.

665
00:30:36,537 --> 00:30:37,538
It's ruining my life.

666
00:30:37,737 --> 00:30:40,388
Today I threatened to
sexually assault a fake baby.

667
00:30:40,737 --> 00:30:43,217
And I became mortal enemies
with Scott Mayhew.

668
00:30:43,377 --> 00:30:45,186
Both of which
are Rachel's fault.

669
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:47,941
Sorry, but they just are.

670
00:30:48,097 --> 00:30:50,384
Of course I'm a dick
for complaining about it.

671
00:30:50,977 --> 00:30:53,423
I mean, I am a dick
for complaining about it.

672
00:30:54,057 --> 00:30:55,946
I didn't actually mean
any of that.

673
00:30:56,097 --> 00:30:57,940
Better play with them titties.

674
00:31:02,537 --> 00:31:04,460
Does this taste strange to you?

675
00:32:01,817 --> 00:32:03,660
<i>The soup had drugs.</i>

676
00:32:08,817 --> 00:32:09,898
Whoa!

677
00:32:14,737 --> 00:32:16,148
McCarthy must've
put weed in that soup

678
00:32:16,217 --> 00:32:17,662
because my brain
is trying to eat itself.

679
00:32:17,817 --> 00:32:18,978
Oh, my God.

680
00:32:19,057 --> 00:32:20,582
I have to go visit
Rachel right now.

681
00:32:20,737 --> 00:32:21,943
Okay, well, you do that.

682
00:32:22,097 --> 00:32:24,259
I'ma be at your house
eatin' up all your dad's food.

683
00:32:24,417 --> 00:32:26,260
No! You have to
come help!

684
00:32:26,417 --> 00:32:27,498
Help with what?

685
00:32:27,657 --> 00:32:28,738
Help!

686
00:32:31,497 --> 00:32:33,465
Hey, in class,
do McCarthy act all, like,

687
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:35,022
stoned and shit?

688
00:32:35,577 --> 00:32:37,500
Uh, I don't know.
I guess.

689
00:32:37,657 --> 00:32:39,022
Yeah, sometimes.

690
00:32:39,177 --> 00:32:40,667
Well, not sometimes,

691
00:32:40,777 --> 00:32:42,302
but you know what I'm...
You know how he is.

692
00:32:42,457 --> 00:32:44,107
Goddamn, son.

693
00:32:44,177 --> 00:32:46,100
You can't even put a full damn
sentence together.

694
00:32:46,257 --> 00:32:49,101
It's insane that Mr. McCarthy
eats soup with drugs in it.

695
00:32:49,257 --> 00:32:52,101
Hey, come on, man,
keep your damn voice down.

696
00:33:04,097 --> 00:33:05,986
We can't tell anyone
we're on drugs.

697
00:33:06,177 --> 00:33:07,622
Why the hell not?

698
00:33:09,817 --> 00:33:11,785
Because then they'll know.

699
00:33:30,897 --> 00:33:33,184
It's my humble little mouse.

700
00:33:33,657 --> 00:33:35,978
And who is
his little mouse friend?

701
00:33:37,817 --> 00:33:39,342
Earl Jackson.

702
00:33:39,977 --> 00:33:43,379
Earl's just my coworker,
and, uh, he's a great guy.

703
00:33:43,537 --> 00:33:45,858
We were just walking around
the neighborhood, you know.

704
00:33:46,017 --> 00:33:48,463
Not really doing anything,

705
00:33:48,537 --> 00:33:50,097
and just wanted
to come say "What's up?"

706
00:33:50,177 --> 00:33:52,179
'Cause Rachel's
about to lose her hair.

707
00:33:52,537 --> 00:33:54,027
Mmm.
So, just wanted to say,

708
00:33:54,097 --> 00:33:56,748
you know,
"Bye, hair. Good riddance."

709
00:33:57,377 --> 00:34:00,062
She's gonna look great without
hair. That's a fact, so...

710
00:34:00,217 --> 00:34:01,946
Yeah, I just wanted to say
what's up.

711
00:34:02,097 --> 00:34:05,101
Rachel! We've got
two cute little mouse boys

712
00:34:05,177 --> 00:34:07,020
on our doorstep
that wanna say hi!

713
00:34:10,097 --> 00:34:15,024
Would you two... mice
like a little bit of cheese?

714
00:34:19,017 --> 00:34:20,178
Okay.

715
00:34:27,217 --> 00:34:29,140
I like your room, Rachel.

716
00:34:29,537 --> 00:34:31,699
Thanks. Greg thinks
it's too girly.

717
00:34:31,857 --> 00:34:34,428
No, I love girly,
I think it's fine.

718
00:34:34,577 --> 00:34:35,703
Well,
it ain't too girly.

719
00:34:35,777 --> 00:34:36,778
I mean, I done seen some
rooms where I'm like:

720
00:34:36,977 --> 00:34:38,706
"Yo, this some
pink puffy bullshit."

721
00:34:38,897 --> 00:34:40,137
I mean, Hello Kitty posters

722
00:34:40,217 --> 00:34:42,458
and chocolate and naked dudes
all over the wall.

723
00:34:42,617 --> 00:34:44,540
They make me want to
throw up for real.

724
00:34:44,697 --> 00:34:47,428
Hey, if you're gonna throw up,
don't do it in here, okay?

725
00:34:47,537 --> 00:34:48,538
This is her room.

726
00:34:50,057 --> 00:34:51,388
Anyways.

727
00:34:51,537 --> 00:34:54,381
Rachel, we really just wanted
to see how you was doin'.

728
00:34:54,777 --> 00:34:55,778
Thanks.

729
00:34:55,937 --> 00:34:58,747
Yeah, chemotherapy.
That really sucks.

730
00:34:58,897 --> 00:34:59,898
Greg.

731
00:35:00,737 --> 00:35:03,820
What the hell, bro?
Don't say it suck, dumb-ass!

732
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:05,502
It does kinda suck.

733
00:35:05,657 --> 00:35:07,739
Yeah, but I mean, you gotta do
what you gotta do.

734
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:09,262
Yeah, I guess.

735
00:35:11,177 --> 00:35:12,178
Um...

736
00:35:14,577 --> 00:35:15,658
Uh...

737
00:35:15,897 --> 00:35:17,217
Look, you guys can go
if you want.

738
00:35:17,337 --> 00:35:19,021
We're on drugs.
Oh, shit!

739
00:35:19,177 --> 00:35:20,417
Why are you on drugs?

740
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:22,147
Well, we're accidentally
on drugs.

741
00:35:22,297 --> 00:35:23,423
"Accidentally"?

742
00:35:23,577 --> 00:35:25,261
McCarthy gave us some soup.

743
00:35:25,417 --> 00:35:27,624
Well, McCarthy gave us
some of his,

744
00:35:27,777 --> 00:35:29,347
you know, just regular,
normal soup...

745
00:35:29,497 --> 00:35:30,578
...but then, it was
the last of the soup

746
00:35:30,697 --> 00:35:31,937
so we had to go get some more...

747
00:35:31,977 --> 00:35:33,786
...from a restaurant,

748
00:35:33,857 --> 00:35:35,621
on the fifth floor
of an office building.

749
00:35:35,777 --> 00:35:37,063
And in the same building,

750
00:35:37,137 --> 00:35:38,377
there was a Jamaican embassy...

751
00:35:38,457 --> 00:35:40,858
...and we ended up
getting trapped

752
00:35:40,937 --> 00:35:42,497
in an elevator
with a Rastafarian guy...

753
00:35:42,617 --> 00:35:45,302
...and he just hotboxed
the whole elevator, so...

754
00:35:45,457 --> 00:35:47,778
We were stuck in there
for, like, 25 minutes...

755
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:49,143
...and we had to breathe
the weird marijuana air.

756
00:35:49,297 --> 00:35:50,867
Earl, am I right?

757
00:35:51,017 --> 00:35:52,462
That's exactly what happened.

758
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:55,618
You guys had
quite an adventure.

759
00:35:55,777 --> 00:35:58,303
Being on drugs
just really sucks.

760
00:35:58,377 --> 00:35:59,867
Being around people
on drugs sucks.

761
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:03,584
This whole situation, really
sorry, just sucks. I'm sorry.

762
00:36:03,777 --> 00:36:06,348
Yo, yo. What the hell
is your problem, man?

763
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:07,908
All apologetic and shit,

764
00:36:07,977 --> 00:36:09,024
making shit
'bout your sorry ass.

765
00:36:09,177 --> 00:36:11,145
Look, that's not what we came
here to do. Okay?

766
00:36:11,297 --> 00:36:12,822
You wanna help,
you gonna take this girl out

767
00:36:12,897 --> 00:36:14,547
to get some ice cream.

768
00:36:15,137 --> 00:36:17,185
And me, too,
'cause I love that shit.

769
00:36:17,337 --> 00:36:18,498
You like ice cream?

770
00:36:18,657 --> 00:36:19,658
Yeah.

771
00:36:20,137 --> 00:36:22,139
So, you know
Greg from class?

772
00:36:22,857 --> 00:36:24,905
I've known Greg
ever since we were little.

773
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:26,980
You know, I was in
y'all kindergarten, right?

774
00:36:27,137 --> 00:36:28,298
Really?

775
00:36:28,377 --> 00:36:29,902
Mmm-hmm. I remember you.

776
00:36:29,977 --> 00:36:31,979
You was the girl who called
Justin Jones perverted...

777
00:36:32,057 --> 00:36:34,424
...for showing girls
the birthmark on his butt.

778
00:36:34,577 --> 00:36:35,783
Oh, my God, yes!

779
00:36:36,257 --> 00:36:37,941
Yeah, dude came running up,

780
00:36:38,057 --> 00:36:39,900
showed you his butt.
You were calm.

781
00:36:40,097 --> 00:36:42,668
Said, "Justin, only perverts
show their butts."

782
00:36:42,737 --> 00:36:43,777
I was right there.

783
00:36:43,937 --> 00:36:45,746
I can't believe
you remember that.

784
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:49,180
You a hero. Shut his
perverted ass right down.

785
00:36:49,337 --> 00:36:50,862
I never forget it.

786
00:36:51,577 --> 00:36:53,705
So you and Greg are coworkers?

787
00:36:53,857 --> 00:36:54,938
Naw, we friends.

788
00:36:55,017 --> 00:36:57,497
He just hates calling people
his friend. Dude's got issues.

789
00:36:57,737 --> 00:37:00,104
Yeah, he does.
What's going on?

790
00:37:00,257 --> 00:37:02,783
Man, I don't even know.
It might be his folks.

791
00:37:02,937 --> 00:37:04,826
I mean, dude's mom
always tellin' him

792
00:37:04,897 --> 00:37:06,706
how handsome he is,
which he ain't.

793
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:09,701
So now he think he can't trust
anybody close to him.

794
00:37:09,857 --> 00:37:10,983
Dude's weird-ass dad

795
00:37:11,057 --> 00:37:13,298
don't socialize with anybody
'cept the cat.

796
00:37:13,457 --> 00:37:15,858
So that's a role model
ain't got no friends.

797
00:37:16,257 --> 00:37:17,827
Bottom line, dude's terrified

798
00:37:17,897 --> 00:37:19,547
of callin' somebody
his friend...

799
00:37:19,697 --> 00:37:21,904
...and they sayin', "Hey, bro,
I'm not your friend."

800
00:37:22,097 --> 00:37:23,337
Then he'd have to kill himself.

801
00:37:23,617 --> 00:37:25,460
But how are you coworkers?

802
00:37:25,617 --> 00:37:28,268
We, um, we make films.

803
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:29,698
Movies?

804
00:37:29,897 --> 00:37:32,741
Yeah. We been making them
for a few years now.

805
00:37:32,897 --> 00:37:34,945
We have, like, 42 in total.

806
00:37:35,297 --> 00:37:36,901
Greg! You never told me.

807
00:37:37,057 --> 00:37:38,297
Well, we never told
anybody 'bout them.

808
00:37:38,377 --> 00:37:40,379
They suck.
I mean, they're terrible.

809
00:37:40,577 --> 00:37:42,386
I'm pretty sure they don't suck.

810
00:37:42,577 --> 00:37:44,739
Well, you can see
for yourself if you want.

811
00:37:45,217 --> 00:37:46,264
Are you sure?

812
00:37:46,417 --> 00:37:47,498
Hell, yeah,
don't even worry about it.

813
00:37:47,657 --> 00:37:48,658
Just don't tell nobody.

814
00:37:48,737 --> 00:37:50,148
No, of course,
I won't.

815
00:37:51,457 --> 00:37:53,027
All right, son,
get on your feet.

816
00:37:53,097 --> 00:37:54,098
Sounds good.

817
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:56,422
Where are we going?

818
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:02,145
<i>A candy-colored
clown they call the sandman</i>

819
00:38:02,577 --> 00:38:05,103
<i>Tiptoes to my room every night</i>

820
00:38:06,297 --> 00:38:08,868
<i>Just to sprinkle stardust
and to whisper</i>

821
00:38:09,777 --> 00:38:14,988
<i>Go to sleep,
everything is all right</i>

822
00:38:16,297 --> 00:38:18,982
<i>I close my eyes</i>

823
00:38:20,697 --> 00:38:22,301
<i>Then I drift away</i>

824
00:38:23,777 --> 00:38:25,108
We can walk you home.

825
00:38:25,257 --> 00:38:26,377
He needs to recover,

826
00:38:26,457 --> 00:38:28,459
and you probably
should look after him.

827
00:38:30,017 --> 00:38:31,098
Peace, peace.

828
00:38:31,257 --> 00:38:32,827
Thanks.
Bye.

829
00:38:35,857 --> 00:38:37,780
Goddamn it, Earl.

830
00:38:37,937 --> 00:38:39,621
Son, don't even start.

831
00:38:39,777 --> 00:38:41,188
Pig's foot.

832
00:38:45,457 --> 00:38:48,222
<i>So, we're pretty far
into this stupid story now...</i>

833
00:38:48,377 --> 00:38:50,903
<i>...and you're probably
saying to yourself,</i>

834
00:38:50,977 --> 00:38:52,502
<i>"Hey. I like this girl Rachel.</i>

835
00:38:52,657 --> 00:38:55,137
<i>"And I'm gonna be pissed
if she dies at the end."</i>

836
00:38:55,297 --> 00:38:58,983
<i>So, I'm just telling you:
don't freak out. She survives.</i>

837
00:38:59,817 --> 00:39:02,297
<i>So, hopefully,
that reassures you.</i>

838
00:39:03,737 --> 00:39:05,819
<i>Although, actually,
why would it?</i>

839
00:39:05,977 --> 00:39:09,060
I'm just overwhelmed
with your enthusiasm today.

840
00:39:09,217 --> 00:39:10,742
I guess we're just gonna have
to do it

841
00:39:10,817 --> 00:39:12,660
the old-fashioned way.

842
00:39:13,177 --> 00:39:14,667
I'm thinking of one of you.

843
00:39:14,817 --> 00:39:16,387
I'm not gonna mention any names,

844
00:39:16,497 --> 00:39:18,067
but your initials...

845
00:39:18,257 --> 00:39:19,258
...are Scott Mayhew.

846
00:39:19,737 --> 00:39:21,819
Fact: Greg's been
telling everyone

847
00:39:21,897 --> 00:39:23,228
your soup has marijuana in it.

848
00:39:23,377 --> 00:39:24,902
I didn't tell anyone.

849
00:39:25,097 --> 00:39:26,701
I heard you bellowing
about it on public transit.

850
00:39:26,857 --> 00:39:28,746
Is that a fact, Greg?

851
00:39:30,937 --> 00:39:34,020
Look, yesterday,
Earl and I got stoned somehow.

852
00:39:34,177 --> 00:39:35,861
And it was after
we both ate your soup.

853
00:39:36,017 --> 00:39:37,337
And we didn't smoke
any marijuana,

854
00:39:37,377 --> 00:39:38,902
which I have never done,
so...

855
00:39:39,057 --> 00:39:40,297
Your soup must have drugs in it,

856
00:39:40,337 --> 00:39:41,782
'cause that was the only thing
we both ate...

857
00:39:41,857 --> 00:39:43,746
...other than some cookies
we got from Ill Phil,

858
00:39:43,857 --> 00:39:45,347
the drug dealer.

859
00:39:46,857 --> 00:39:48,018
Aha.

860
00:39:48,697 --> 00:39:50,904
Man, how did you not know
it was the cookies?

861
00:39:51,057 --> 00:39:54,266
Man, it was your dumb ass
yelling that shit on the bus.

862
00:39:54,457 --> 00:39:55,697
Yo, Greg!

863
00:39:55,857 --> 00:39:57,461
Did you snitch on me?

864
00:39:57,617 --> 00:39:59,107
He did snitch on you!

865
00:39:59,857 --> 00:40:00,904
I was there.

866
00:40:01,057 --> 00:40:02,821
I heard you ridiculing me

867
00:40:02,897 --> 00:40:04,706
in front of
your loathsome harem.

868
00:40:05,217 --> 00:40:07,743
You have made...
a mortal enemy.

869
00:40:08,257 --> 00:40:09,861
And I will never stop
hounding you.

870
00:40:09,977 --> 00:40:12,821
Yeah, you made two mortal
enemies. I stabbed a dude.

871
00:40:12,937 --> 00:40:13,938
Jesus.

872
00:40:14,057 --> 00:40:15,547
<i>I'll kill you 20 different ways</i>

873
00:40:15,617 --> 00:40:16,948
<i>Stab you with blades</i>

874
00:40:17,097 --> 00:40:20,146
<i>Shoot you with death rays
Abandon you in a maze</i>

875
00:40:20,297 --> 00:40:22,743
<i>Choke you on mayonnaise</i>

876
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:48,659
So they haven't really
done anything.

877
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:50,421
It's been about a month now.

878
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:53,342
They did say they're never
gonna stop hounding me...

879
00:40:53,497 --> 00:40:56,307
...so, sooner or later...
you know...

880
00:40:56,457 --> 00:40:57,868
...gonna get hounded.

881
00:41:00,457 --> 00:41:03,779
Sorry, next time
I'll bring you some flowers.

882
00:41:05,097 --> 00:41:06,940
Though I don't even know
where I'd put them.

883
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:09,941
It's like, like the only place
left is the barf bucket.

884
00:41:12,817 --> 00:41:14,342
Flowers.

885
00:41:15,977 --> 00:41:17,467
Where you barf.

886
00:41:23,297 --> 00:41:24,787
I like that hat.

887
00:41:26,457 --> 00:41:27,947
It's pretty cute.

888
00:41:32,377 --> 00:41:36,302
Look, I've never
been very beautiful...

889
00:41:36,777 --> 00:41:40,304
...and that's fine because
that's not important to me.

890
00:41:40,617 --> 00:41:41,857
But...

891
00:41:44,337 --> 00:41:46,339
I thought it'd be
easier looking like this.

892
00:41:46,457 --> 00:41:47,743
It's just not.

893
00:41:50,297 --> 00:41:52,982
Everyone comes in here
and sees me...

894
00:41:53,297 --> 00:41:55,698
...and they're
so clearly repulsed.

895
00:41:56,857 --> 00:41:59,337
It's so much harder
than I thought it would be.

896
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:01,182
Hey, come on.

897
00:42:01,577 --> 00:42:02,658
You look good.

898
00:42:02,817 --> 00:42:06,344
I'm ugly, Greg!
I'm so ugly.

899
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,985
Everyone feels like
they have to lie to me and no one

900
00:42:09,097 --> 00:42:11,065
realizes how insulting that is.

901
00:42:11,497 --> 00:42:13,818
Everyone thinks they're
helping, and they're not.

902
00:42:29,857 --> 00:42:31,018
Here.

903
00:42:31,937 --> 00:42:33,177
That one's called <i>Mono Rash.</i>

904
00:42:33,257 --> 00:42:35,225
It's based on <i>Rashomon</i>
by Kurosawa.

905
00:42:35,377 --> 00:42:36,977
Plot's basically
just Earl killing people

906
00:42:37,017 --> 00:42:38,178
'cause he has a rash...

907
00:42:38,337 --> 00:42:40,578
...from mono,
you know, the STD.

908
00:42:42,577 --> 00:42:45,421
Anyway, we're supposed
to go work on

909
00:42:45,537 --> 00:42:47,539
our homage to <i>Apocalypse Now.</i>

910
00:42:47,697 --> 00:42:49,699
Ours is called
<i>A Box O' Lips, Wow,</i>

911
00:42:49,777 --> 00:42:51,137
which is even worse
than <i>Mono Rash.</i>

912
00:42:52,137 --> 00:42:54,060
It's a war movie
where these two guys

913
00:42:54,137 --> 00:42:55,707
take part in the unspeakable
brutality of war...

914
00:42:55,857 --> 00:42:57,985
...and then they find
a box of tulips.

915
00:42:58,137 --> 00:43:00,299
Box O' Lips, yeah.
And they're just, "Wow."

916
00:43:00,457 --> 00:43:02,539
They can't get over
how great these tulips are,

917
00:43:02,617 --> 00:43:04,221
it's like,
"A box o' lips, wow!"

918
00:43:05,377 --> 00:43:06,737
The worst part is,
tulips might not

919
00:43:06,777 --> 00:43:08,427
even be in the budget anymore.

920
00:43:10,657 --> 00:43:11,783
I should actually just stay here

921
00:43:11,897 --> 00:43:13,308
and keep you from watching that.

922
00:43:13,737 --> 00:43:16,263
No! I'm fine. Go make it.

923
00:43:16,377 --> 00:43:17,378
Okay.

924
00:43:19,937 --> 00:43:21,587
Okay. Have fun watching

925
00:43:21,657 --> 00:43:23,625
this incredibly terrible movie.

926
00:43:23,817 --> 00:43:25,660
Mmm. Have fun

927
00:43:25,737 --> 00:43:27,148
making the next one.
Mmm-hmm.

928
00:43:50,177 --> 00:43:51,588
Hey, white boy!

929
00:43:51,777 --> 00:43:53,700
Why don't you make me
a tulip 'fore I have Doopie come down

930
00:43:53,777 --> 00:43:55,620
there and eat your face?

931
00:43:56,417 --> 00:43:58,340
But no, for real.
Can you make me a tulip?

932
00:43:58,537 --> 00:44:00,107
Oh, my God!
Am I on set right now?

933
00:44:00,257 --> 00:44:01,588
Oh, damn!
Oh, my God!

934
00:44:01,657 --> 00:44:04,661
Ahh! I can't take it!
Action! Cut!

935
00:44:05,617 --> 00:44:07,619
Madison, why are you here?

936
00:44:07,777 --> 00:44:09,222
Rachel said that
I could find you here...

937
00:44:09,377 --> 00:44:10,981
...and your phone was going
straight to voice mail.

938
00:44:11,177 --> 00:44:13,179
Probably 'cause there ain't
no good service down there!

939
00:44:13,337 --> 00:44:15,180
But I had to get here
'cause I had to let you know.

940
00:44:15,337 --> 00:44:17,817
So, I was visiting Rachel,
and I was giving her a card...

941
00:44:18,017 --> 00:44:20,338
...and she was watching
one of your secret movies.

942
00:44:20,497 --> 00:44:21,828
Oh, my God.
Wait, did you see any of it?

943
00:44:22,017 --> 00:44:23,497
No! No, she turned it
off immediately.

944
00:44:23,617 --> 00:44:24,857
It was good, it was good.

945
00:44:24,977 --> 00:44:26,138
You know,
you're both Japanese, and...

946
00:44:26,297 --> 00:44:27,981
...Earl beheaded you,
and, but then,

947
00:44:28,057 --> 00:44:29,343
she, like, turned it off.

948
00:44:29,497 --> 00:44:31,818
But I had a brainstorm. Okay?
I had an amazing brainstorm.

949
00:44:31,977 --> 00:44:35,743
I realized... you need to
make a film for Rachel.

950
00:44:37,017 --> 00:44:38,348
What do you think?

951
00:44:39,057 --> 00:44:40,821
It would be like her favorite
thing in the entire world...

952
00:44:40,977 --> 00:44:43,137
...and it's like the most
important thing you could do.

953
00:44:43,737 --> 00:44:45,307
You have to do it.

954
00:44:49,257 --> 00:44:50,383
Yeah, word.

955
00:44:50,537 --> 00:44:53,188
"Word"? Like, word,
you'll do it, word?

956
00:45:00,817 --> 00:45:01,864
Yep.

957
00:45:02,057 --> 00:45:03,058
Oh, my God, awesome!

958
00:45:03,217 --> 00:45:04,423
Okay, well,
I can't wait to see it.

959
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:06,067
Um, okay, I gotta go, but...

960
00:45:07,017 --> 00:45:08,064
Cut!

961
00:45:08,857 --> 00:45:10,063
That's a wrap!

962
00:45:10,497 --> 00:45:11,498
Rolling!

963
00:45:12,497 --> 00:45:13,544
Titties.

964
00:45:13,737 --> 00:45:15,262
Goddamn it!

965
00:45:15,857 --> 00:45:17,097
<i>In the next few weeks,</i>

966
00:45:17,177 --> 00:45:19,179
<i>did I start
making that movie? No.</i>

967
00:45:19,337 --> 00:45:21,385
<i>Because I didn't agree
to make that movie.</i>

968
00:45:21,537 --> 00:45:23,460
<i>All I said was, "Word."</i>

969
00:45:23,617 --> 00:45:25,267
<i>"Word" could mean anything.</i>

970
00:45:25,457 --> 00:45:26,788
<i>Plus, we had at least
a month or two...</i>

971
00:45:26,937 --> 00:45:28,098
<i>...before she'd ran through</i>

972
00:45:28,177 --> 00:45:30,179
<i>all the terrible films
we'd already made.</i>

973
00:45:30,377 --> 00:45:32,698
<i>For example,</i>
A Sockwork Orange.

974
00:45:58,817 --> 00:46:00,057
"Droogle"?

975
00:46:01,257 --> 00:46:03,259
It's Google for droogs.

976
00:46:04,217 --> 00:46:05,218
What's that?

977
00:46:05,897 --> 00:46:07,945
Nothing, just the bane
of my existence.

978
00:46:09,617 --> 00:46:11,257
Which my mom is forcing me
to carry around

979
00:46:11,337 --> 00:46:13,066
until I apply
to some colleges.

980
00:46:14,457 --> 00:46:15,982
She says it's like a menu

981
00:46:16,057 --> 00:46:17,058
for my future,
and I was, like, "Sure.

982
00:46:17,257 --> 00:46:19,225
"A menu that only has food

983
00:46:19,297 --> 00:46:21,345
"that will humiliate me
for four years."

984
00:46:21,497 --> 00:46:24,626
You have to be less
of an idiot about college.

985
00:46:25,137 --> 00:46:27,344
Listen, even if you think
people won't like you...

986
00:46:27,497 --> 00:46:30,421
...which is literally
an insane thing to think...

987
00:46:30,577 --> 00:46:32,306
...you're way less exposed
to people in college.

988
00:46:32,457 --> 00:46:35,108
High school is 40 hours
of class a week.

989
00:46:35,257 --> 00:46:37,783
College is, like, 15 and 20.

990
00:46:37,937 --> 00:46:39,302
And if you don't want to
live with other people,

991
00:46:39,417 --> 00:46:41,818
then go to Pittsburgh State.

992
00:46:41,977 --> 00:46:43,627
Live at home.

993
00:46:43,817 --> 00:46:46,468
It's better than
sitting college out

994
00:46:46,537 --> 00:46:48,187
because you irrationally
hate yourself.

995
00:46:48,617 --> 00:46:50,540
Not irrationally, though.

996
00:46:50,697 --> 00:46:52,267
Apply to Pittsburgh State.

997
00:46:53,097 --> 00:46:55,304
Right now. Apply early.

998
00:46:55,937 --> 00:46:59,180
Come on. Do it in front of me.
Apply to Pittsburgh State.

999
00:46:59,337 --> 00:47:00,623
What if I say no?

1000
00:47:02,297 --> 00:47:04,504
I have stage four cancer.

1001
00:47:06,337 --> 00:47:08,658
So that would be a pretty
dick move. Come on.

1002
00:47:08,817 --> 00:47:09,978
Fine.

1003
00:47:16,737 --> 00:47:20,901
"Why I want to
go... to college."

1004
00:47:25,137 --> 00:47:27,139
By Werner Herzog.

1005
00:47:28,577 --> 00:47:29,817
The highly selective

1006
00:47:29,897 --> 00:47:31,422
admissions process...

1007
00:47:31,577 --> 00:47:34,387
...weeds out the cruel
and the stupid.

1008
00:47:34,537 --> 00:47:37,746
So college is unlike
the senseless chaos...

1009
00:47:37,897 --> 00:47:41,504
...and sickening enormity
of high school.

1010
00:47:41,657 --> 00:47:45,059
High school is the mouth
of a great demon...

1011
00:47:45,217 --> 00:47:46,867
...biting and chewing

1012
00:47:47,017 --> 00:47:48,667
and smushing people in the face.

1013
00:47:49,857 --> 00:47:52,667
It is simply overwhelming.

1014
00:47:56,057 --> 00:47:57,866
In all seriousness,

1015
00:47:57,937 --> 00:47:59,541
I am looking forward
to college...

1016
00:47:59,737 --> 00:48:02,502
...because I didn't really
fit in in high school,

1017
00:48:02,617 --> 00:48:03,664
because of my weird
rodent face...

1018
00:48:03,737 --> 00:48:04,784
No.

1019
00:48:04,857 --> 00:48:07,861
...and a habit of saying
the dumbest possible shit.

1020
00:48:08,017 --> 00:48:09,018
No!

1021
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:11,942
The sheer pastiness
of my complexion...

1022
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:16,182
...overwhelms all who behold
it with existential nausea.

1023
00:48:16,377 --> 00:48:21,258
"In high school, I never
truly felt comfortable...

1024
00:48:21,617 --> 00:48:22,903
"...in my own skin.

1025
00:48:23,057 --> 00:48:25,025
"In fact,
I've always been someone...

1026
00:48:25,217 --> 00:48:28,858
"...who doesn't
really like themselves.

1027
00:48:29,617 --> 00:48:33,588
"But I think that's because I
have some growing up to do...

1028
00:48:33,737 --> 00:48:38,265
"...and college is the place
where I'm going to do it."

1029
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:42,708
That's way too personal.

1030
00:48:42,857 --> 00:48:44,188
It's a personal essay.

1031
00:48:46,897 --> 00:48:48,377
Fine, if you want to
see this again...

1032
00:48:48,457 --> 00:48:50,266
Okay! Okay!

1033
00:48:51,017 --> 00:48:53,463
But only because cancer.

1034
00:48:54,177 --> 00:48:57,181
And you know what?
You have to do this too now.
Here.

1035
00:48:57,857 --> 00:48:59,541
Page through this huge,
horrible book

1036
00:48:59,617 --> 00:49:00,778
and find some colleges.

1037
00:49:00,937 --> 00:49:02,223
That's yours now.

1038
00:49:03,257 --> 00:49:05,578
Mmm. It's like a menu
for your future.

1039
00:49:09,777 --> 00:49:11,506
Can I finish my movie first?

1040
00:49:33,777 --> 00:49:39,341
<i>I'll find a place
somewhere in the corner</i>

1041
00:49:41,457 --> 00:49:46,861
<i>I'm gonna waste
the rest of my days</i>

1042
00:49:49,017 --> 00:49:54,786
<i>Just watching patiently
from the window</i>

1043
00:49:56,817 --> 00:50:00,981
<i>Just waiting
Seasons change someday</i>

1044
00:50:01,057 --> 00:50:02,946
<i>Oh, oh, my dreams will pull you</i>

1045
00:50:03,017 --> 00:50:04,462
<i>Through that garden gate</i>

1046
00:50:04,537 --> 00:50:09,703
<i>I want to be
the wandering sailor</i>

1047
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:17,587
<i>We're silhouettes
by the light of the moon</i>

1048
00:50:19,817 --> 00:50:24,345
<i>I sit playing solitaire
by the window</i>

1049
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:31,707
<i>Just waiting Seasons change, aha</i>

1050
00:50:31,817 --> 00:50:33,148
<i>You'll see, one day</i>

1051
00:50:33,217 --> 00:50:35,504
<i>These dreams will pull you
through my door</i>

1052
00:50:35,577 --> 00:50:40,026
<i>And I'll come running
to tie your shoe</i>

1053
00:50:43,537 --> 00:50:48,862
<i>I'll come running
to tie your shoe</i>

1054
00:50:51,217 --> 00:50:55,859
<i>I'll come running
to tie your shoe</i>

1055
00:50:59,017 --> 00:51:03,864
<i>I'll come running
to tie your shoe</i>

1056
00:51:33,057 --> 00:51:34,900
So,
if we make this film,

1057
00:51:34,977 --> 00:51:36,058
people are gonna be, like:

1058
00:51:36,417 --> 00:51:37,498
"Oh, Greg and Earl,

1059
00:51:37,577 --> 00:51:39,067
"they're those weird filmmakers.

1060
00:51:39,217 --> 00:51:40,901
"They're always
creepily filming stuff.

1061
00:51:41,057 --> 00:51:42,627
"They'll probably sneak into
your house one night

1062
00:51:42,737 --> 00:51:43,943
"and film you
while you're sleeping."

1063
00:51:44,057 --> 00:51:45,422
But people probably
already think that,

1064
00:51:45,497 --> 00:51:46,498
'cause you gave Rachel
those stupid films.

1065
00:51:46,577 --> 00:51:47,578
This is nasty as hell.

1066
00:51:47,657 --> 00:51:49,341
So now, I've become
completely conspicuous,

1067
00:51:49,417 --> 00:51:50,578
like all the time.

1068
00:51:50,737 --> 00:51:51,943
People look at me and think,

1069
00:51:52,057 --> 00:51:53,183
"Filmmaker."
The hell even is this?

1070
00:51:53,297 --> 00:51:54,298
When they're not
already thinking,

1071
00:51:54,417 --> 00:51:55,457
"Cancer girl's boyfriend."

1072
00:51:55,497 --> 00:51:56,783
It tastes like a dog's
funky-ass butthole.

1073
00:51:56,897 --> 00:51:58,058
Furthermore,
we agreed to do a film

1074
00:51:58,137 --> 00:51:59,787
that we have no idea
what it should look like...

1075
00:51:59,937 --> 00:52:01,746
...or sound like, or even be.

1076
00:52:01,817 --> 00:52:03,023
I mean,
what the hell sort of film

1077
00:52:03,097 --> 00:52:05,179
should we even make? Huh?

1078
00:52:05,257 --> 00:52:07,066
I mean, what was I thinking?

1079
00:52:07,137 --> 00:52:08,263
You were thinking
that girl Madison

1080
00:52:08,337 --> 00:52:09,463
had nice titties.

1081
00:52:09,577 --> 00:52:10,817
I mean,
I like the titties too,

1082
00:52:10,937 --> 00:52:12,507
but now you got a problem.

1083
00:52:12,577 --> 00:52:14,181
'Cause I ain't agreed
to do this shit.

1084
00:52:14,257 --> 00:52:15,304
You did.

1085
00:52:16,817 --> 00:52:18,945
Are you not gonna
help me make this?

1086
00:52:19,017 --> 00:52:20,746
The hell we gonna make, son?

1087
00:52:20,817 --> 00:52:23,297
<i>They want fresh inspiration.</i>

1088
00:52:23,457 --> 00:52:25,017
I must tell you,
the richest inspiration

1089
00:52:25,097 --> 00:52:26,667
I have ever known was...

1090
00:52:26,817 --> 00:52:29,104
...during my period of
quarantine in the Amazon.

1091
00:52:30,657 --> 00:52:32,341
Where I
and a half dozen other...

1092
00:52:32,457 --> 00:52:34,619
...unfortunates
had nothing to watch...

1093
00:52:34,777 --> 00:52:38,498
...but the bristling,
leviathan tarantula...

1094
00:52:38,657 --> 00:52:41,786
...bunched up on
the rotting, flimsy thatch...

1095
00:52:41,977 --> 00:52:43,979
...perhaps eight feet
above our faces.

1096
00:52:44,537 --> 00:52:47,302
Spiders the size of your fist.

1097
00:52:47,457 --> 00:52:49,983
Their fangs glistening
with venom and...

1098
00:52:50,137 --> 00:52:51,866
...their thousand-fold
black eyes

1099
00:52:51,977 --> 00:52:54,184
shining dully in the gloom.

1100
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:55,623
In the darkness,
you would hear

1101
00:52:55,697 --> 00:52:57,142
the sudden anguished hiss...

1102
00:52:57,297 --> 00:53:00,380
...of a spider being struck
by an adult leopard wasp...

1103
00:53:00,577 --> 00:53:01,703
...and in their
mortal struggle,

1104
00:53:01,817 --> 00:53:03,137
they would plummet
to one's bed...

1105
00:53:03,217 --> 00:53:06,187
...biting and stinging
and thrashing...

1106
00:53:07,737 --> 00:53:09,899
You know that you can
smoke a hornet?

1107
00:53:11,137 --> 00:53:13,538
Okay, so just look at me
when you answer the questions.

1108
00:53:13,657 --> 00:53:15,898
Don't worry
about the camera, all right?

1109
00:53:16,977 --> 00:53:18,741
Okay, Denise.

1110
00:53:18,817 --> 00:53:20,660
Tell me a little
about Rachel's birth.

1111
00:53:21,577 --> 00:53:23,386
Uh, Rachel's birth.

1112
00:53:23,817 --> 00:53:25,421
What an ordeal that was.

1113
00:53:27,737 --> 00:53:30,661
Greg, just...
let me tell you one thing.

1114
00:53:31,737 --> 00:53:33,387
I was a really good mom
to her, you know?

1115
00:53:33,497 --> 00:53:35,022
I really was.

1116
00:53:35,217 --> 00:53:37,538
Some single moms,
their kids grow up too fast...

1117
00:53:37,697 --> 00:53:39,381
...but I always tried to
protect Rachel from that.

1118
00:53:39,537 --> 00:53:42,063
I did my very best
to protect her from...

1119
00:53:43,777 --> 00:53:45,700
...growing up too quickly,
you know?

1120
00:53:47,457 --> 00:53:48,538
Right.

1121
00:53:48,617 --> 00:53:50,858
And now, I'm learning
that there are...

1122
00:53:52,617 --> 00:53:53,698
...there are just
some things that you can't

1123
00:53:53,777 --> 00:53:55,825
protect your kid from,
you know?

1124
00:53:57,377 --> 00:53:59,618
No matter what you do,
you just...

1125
00:54:06,177 --> 00:54:08,862
So, did she have
any favorite toys?

1126
00:54:09,377 --> 00:54:11,539
Before I answer that question,
this is serious...

1127
00:54:13,337 --> 00:54:15,988
...so use your ears
and listen to me.

1128
00:54:17,057 --> 00:54:18,468
I want you
to promise me something

1129
00:54:18,537 --> 00:54:19,868
as I care about you.

1130
00:54:20,017 --> 00:54:21,746
You gotta promise me you're
not gonna have a baby...

1131
00:54:21,857 --> 00:54:22,824
...unless you're
ready to love

1132
00:54:22,897 --> 00:54:24,337
that baby's mother
your whole life...

1133
00:54:24,377 --> 00:54:25,378
...and this is serious.

1134
00:54:25,537 --> 00:54:28,859
I'm telling you something
that nobody's gonna tell you.

1135
00:54:29,017 --> 00:54:32,339
Don't pick a girl
who's push-pull, you know?

1136
00:54:32,417 --> 00:54:35,148
You wanna pick somebody
who's gonna love you...

1137
00:54:35,817 --> 00:54:38,058
...and not forget you,
and not...

1138
00:54:38,257 --> 00:54:41,386
...leave you for someone
with a big, fat ass.

1139
00:54:41,977 --> 00:54:43,900
So, no favorite toy.

1140
00:54:44,497 --> 00:54:45,498
Um...

1141
00:54:46,177 --> 00:54:48,498
Oh, you want to know what?
Here's a favorite toy.

1142
00:54:48,577 --> 00:54:49,578
Scissors.

1143
00:54:49,737 --> 00:54:51,580
When Rachel's father
first left...

1144
00:54:51,737 --> 00:54:53,262
...she gathered up
all his books,

1145
00:54:53,337 --> 00:54:54,338
favorite old books...

1146
00:54:54,417 --> 00:54:57,102
...and she rounded 'em up
and she cut them right up.

1147
00:54:57,217 --> 00:54:58,343
Please, don't tell her
I'm telling you,

1148
00:54:58,417 --> 00:54:59,782
she would chop my head off.

1149
00:54:59,937 --> 00:55:02,622
But she just...

1150
00:55:02,697 --> 00:55:04,426
And I was, like,
"Atta girl."

1151
00:55:04,617 --> 00:55:07,780
Snip, snip, snip.
She was very mad.

1152
00:55:07,937 --> 00:55:10,178
Can we take a little break
and have a little taste?

1153
00:55:10,257 --> 00:55:11,782
You boys are old enough
to have a little taste, right?

1154
00:55:11,897 --> 00:55:14,468
Can we take a teeny break,
just have a little taste?

1155
00:55:16,017 --> 00:55:18,623
Oh, yeah, that's a good boy.

1156
00:55:18,777 --> 00:55:21,462
Greg, will you join us?

1157
00:55:21,577 --> 00:55:23,067
Oh, I'm okay.

1158
00:55:23,137 --> 00:55:25,617
Oh, come on,
don't be a party pooper!

1159
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:27,062
All right, all right.

1160
00:55:28,417 --> 00:55:30,943
Now we can get back
to our interview.

1161
00:55:31,737 --> 00:55:32,977
So, basically,
this whole setup

1162
00:55:33,057 --> 00:55:34,183
is so that, you know...

1163
00:55:34,257 --> 00:55:36,066
...I can talk to you,
you can talk to me...

1164
00:55:36,137 --> 00:55:38,378
...and I can see you,
and you can see me.

1165
00:55:38,537 --> 00:55:39,823
Except it's not really me,
it's a phone.

1166
00:55:39,977 --> 00:55:41,820
And I know that
sounds kind of weird,

1167
00:55:41,897 --> 00:55:43,228
but it's not.

1168
00:55:43,457 --> 00:55:46,381
So, anyway, just treat it
like a get-well card,

1169
00:55:46,497 --> 00:55:47,942
you can look into the lens.

1170
00:55:48,097 --> 00:55:49,508
And, uh...

1171
00:55:49,657 --> 00:55:51,421
Yeah, it's a video,
so you know...

1172
00:55:51,577 --> 00:55:52,658
...don't think about it
too hard,

1173
00:55:52,777 --> 00:55:54,427
but just make it good.

1174
00:55:54,577 --> 00:55:55,988
Start whenever you're ready.

1175
00:55:56,137 --> 00:55:57,343
Hi, Rachel.

1176
00:55:57,497 --> 00:55:59,898
I guess I don't really
know you that well...

1177
00:56:00,057 --> 00:56:02,264
...but I believe in you.
You can do it.

1178
00:56:02,417 --> 00:56:03,987
That's real nice, yo.

1179
00:56:04,177 --> 00:56:06,100
It's so sweet
that your boyfriend

1180
00:56:06,177 --> 00:56:07,667
is doing this for you.

1181
00:56:07,817 --> 00:56:09,148
He must really love you.

1182
00:56:09,297 --> 00:56:11,345
Girl, that ain't
her boyfriend.

1183
00:56:11,457 --> 00:56:12,458
Oh.

1184
00:56:12,617 --> 00:56:14,858
<i>I know you're Jewish,
but I just wanted you to know</i>

1185
00:56:14,977 --> 00:56:16,786
<i>that God has a plan for you.</i>

1186
00:56:16,937 --> 00:56:18,098
<i>You seem like
a really cool person.</i>

1187
00:56:18,177 --> 00:56:19,508
<i>I know we don't really talk.</i>

1188
00:56:19,697 --> 00:56:22,701
<i>But you've got
a lot of friends. And, uh...</i>

1189
00:56:22,857 --> 00:56:23,858
<i>Out of all the people
in this school,</i>

1190
00:56:23,937 --> 00:56:25,507
<i>I don't hate you.</i>

1191
00:56:26,097 --> 00:56:28,338
<i>I believe in you
and you can do it.</i>

1192
00:56:28,977 --> 00:56:30,183
<i>You can do it.</i>

1193
00:56:30,537 --> 00:56:32,187
<i>I believe in you.</i>

1194
00:56:32,697 --> 00:56:34,028
<i>You can do it.</i>

1195
00:56:34,177 --> 00:56:35,542
Damn.

1196
00:56:46,457 --> 00:56:49,620
<i>Everybody's talking at me</i>

1197
00:56:50,697 --> 00:56:54,383
<i>I don't hear a word
they're saying</i>

1198
00:56:54,497 --> 00:56:59,059
<i>Only the echoes of my mind</i>

1199
00:57:00,737 --> 00:57:02,148
So again,

1200
00:57:02,217 --> 00:57:04,060
<i>if this was a touching,
romantic story...</i>

1201
00:57:04,177 --> 00:57:05,986
<i>...we'd obviously fall in love</i>

1202
00:57:06,057 --> 00:57:07,900
<i>and she'd say all the wise,
beautiful things...</i>

1203
00:57:08,017 --> 00:57:08,984
<i>...that can only be learned</i>

1204
00:57:09,057 --> 00:57:11,059
<i>in life's twilight or whatever.</i>

1205
00:57:11,217 --> 00:57:13,345
<i>And then she'd die in my arms.</i>

1206
00:57:18,417 --> 00:57:20,818
<i>But again,
that's not what happened.</i>

1207
00:57:20,977 --> 00:57:24,424
<i>She just got quieter.
And unhappier.</i>

1208
00:57:25,417 --> 00:57:27,101
So, how are you?

1209
00:57:28,177 --> 00:57:29,508
For real.

1210
00:57:30,897 --> 00:57:32,262
For real?

1211
00:57:33,697 --> 00:57:35,938
Feeling like
you might have been right.

1212
00:57:39,257 --> 00:57:40,588
Right when?

1213
00:57:41,737 --> 00:57:43,421
Back in October.

1214
00:57:44,257 --> 00:57:46,703
When you thought
I was dying.

1215
00:57:52,617 --> 00:57:55,188
Well, I mean,
I regret thinking that.

1216
00:57:57,257 --> 00:57:58,782
Don't regret it.

1217
00:58:19,057 --> 00:58:20,741
What is that noise?

1218
00:58:20,937 --> 00:58:22,939
It's Regretful Polar Bear.

1219
00:58:25,817 --> 00:58:27,387
Polar Bears have
the purest expression

1220
00:58:27,457 --> 00:58:29,425
of regret in the animal kingdom.

1221
00:58:30,657 --> 00:58:33,979
Just listen to how haunting
and plaintive they sound.

1222
00:58:36,817 --> 00:58:40,219
Don't make me laugh.
Please. It kinda hurts.

1223
00:58:41,817 --> 00:58:42,978
All right.

1224
00:58:53,257 --> 00:58:55,658
Kind of a monster
silence in here.

1225
00:58:58,137 --> 00:58:59,184
Yeah.

1226
00:59:01,337 --> 00:59:03,988
It's okay to just be silent
for a while.

1227
00:59:06,617 --> 00:59:08,028
<i>Look,</i>

1228
00:59:08,137 --> 00:59:09,866
<i>I know you're really
bracing for this sweet girl...</i>

1229
00:59:09,977 --> 00:59:12,298
<i>...that you probably
like a lot to die.</i>

1230
00:59:12,457 --> 00:59:16,178
<i>Just please bear with me.
She doesn't. She gets better.</i>

1231
00:59:16,337 --> 00:59:17,782
<i>I promise.</i>

1232
00:59:56,897 --> 00:59:59,218
<i>Pretty much all I remember
from that winter...</i>

1233
00:59:59,377 --> 01:00:00,981
<i>...is working on
that stupid film...</i>

1234
01:00:01,137 --> 01:00:02,218
<i>...just trying
to make something</i>

1235
01:00:02,297 --> 01:00:04,186
<i>that made some kind of sense...</i>

1236
01:00:04,377 --> 01:00:06,061
<i>...and knowing the whole time
that I couldn't...</i>

1237
01:00:06,217 --> 01:00:07,264
<i>...that maybe it was possible</i>

1238
01:00:07,377 --> 01:00:09,425
<i>to make the thing
we wanted to make...</i>

1239
01:00:09,577 --> 01:00:11,545
<i>...but it wasn't
possible for us.</i>

1240
01:00:12,737 --> 01:00:15,502
<i>That was
an entire winter of my life.</i>

1241
01:00:19,737 --> 01:00:20,818
<i>I mean, obviously,</i>

1242
01:00:20,937 --> 01:00:22,587
<i>I remember visiting Rachel too.</i>

1243
01:00:24,897 --> 01:00:25,944
<i>Sometimes she talked,</i>

1244
01:00:26,017 --> 01:00:28,338
<i>and sometimes,
she didn't want to.</i>

1245
01:00:29,337 --> 01:00:31,339
<i>When she didn't want to,
I talked.</i>

1246
01:00:31,497 --> 01:00:33,340
<i>Or we watched movies.</i>

1247
01:00:33,737 --> 01:00:34,943
<i>Sometimes, she laughed.</i>

1248
01:00:36,537 --> 01:00:38,107
<i>Sometimes, she didn't.</i>

1249
01:00:43,617 --> 01:00:46,587
<i>What I don't remember
is doing schoolwork.</i>

1250
01:00:48,777 --> 01:00:51,462
<i>I did literally zero
schoolwork during this time.</i>

1251
01:00:57,897 --> 01:00:58,944
<i>Not figuratively.</i>

1252
01:00:59,857 --> 01:01:02,622
<i>Literally zero schoolwork.</i>

1253
01:01:06,737 --> 01:01:09,104
<i>That's actually
sort of hard to do.</i>

1254
01:01:28,337 --> 01:01:30,465
So, what's going on at school?

1255
01:01:32,777 --> 01:01:35,064
Well, right now,
the whole school looks like a castle...

1256
01:01:35,177 --> 01:01:37,339
...'cause everyone's
getting ready

1257
01:01:37,417 --> 01:01:38,782
for Medieval Prom.

1258
01:01:40,897 --> 01:01:44,026
I guess everyone's trying
to figure out how to, like...

1259
01:01:44,097 --> 01:01:45,428
...twerk medievally?

1260
01:01:47,257 --> 01:01:48,497
Are you going?

1261
01:01:48,657 --> 01:01:49,863
No, of course not.

1262
01:01:50,017 --> 01:01:51,507
You should go.

1263
01:01:51,657 --> 01:01:53,182
No way!

1264
01:01:53,937 --> 01:01:55,939
Have you seen me in a tux?

1265
01:01:57,337 --> 01:01:59,943
It's like when they make
a dog wear human clothes.

1266
01:02:00,017 --> 01:02:01,178
Have you seen that?

1267
01:02:01,337 --> 01:02:04,147
It just makes you
really sad to look at.

1268
01:02:06,697 --> 01:02:09,462
Oh, and I don't have
anyone to go with.

1269
01:02:09,537 --> 01:02:10,823
So there's that.

1270
01:02:15,977 --> 01:02:17,183
Unless...

1271
01:02:17,697 --> 01:02:19,347
...you know...
you wanted to...

1272
01:02:19,497 --> 01:02:21,340
Greg, I'm not going to prom.

1273
01:02:21,497 --> 01:02:23,226
I mean, you totally could.

1274
01:02:23,337 --> 01:02:25,544
It could be like a,
s-, awesome statement.

1275
01:02:25,857 --> 01:02:27,143
Hey, uh...

1276
01:02:27,217 --> 01:02:30,346
When are you guys
finishing your movie?

1277
01:02:33,217 --> 01:02:35,504
You don't know
we're working on a movie right now.

1278
01:02:36,057 --> 01:02:37,468
You don't have to pretend.

1279
01:02:37,537 --> 01:02:40,586
Earl told me you guys
were making a movie for me.

1280
01:02:43,057 --> 01:02:44,582
God, yeah...

1281
01:02:45,737 --> 01:02:47,546
I guess he probably did.

1282
01:02:48,377 --> 01:02:49,537
I was just asking, because...

1283
01:02:49,657 --> 01:02:51,227
Goddamn it, Earl! Ugh.

1284
01:02:51,417 --> 01:02:54,068
It was just, it was
supposed to be a surprise!

1285
01:02:54,737 --> 01:02:56,501
You know?
It's taking forever

1286
01:02:56,577 --> 01:02:57,817
because we really want
to get it right, and...

1287
01:02:57,897 --> 01:03:01,219
I'm probably gonna
stop treatment pretty soon.

1288
01:03:06,017 --> 01:03:07,098
What?

1289
01:03:11,097 --> 01:03:13,020
It just isn't
doing me any good.

1290
01:03:13,097 --> 01:03:15,418
All it's doing
is making me sicker.

1291
01:03:23,937 --> 01:03:26,417
Yeah, but it...
I mean, if you stop, then...

1292
01:03:26,617 --> 01:03:28,699
Well, we'll just
see what happens.

1293
01:03:30,377 --> 01:03:32,857
Well, we know
what's gonna happen, right?

1294
01:03:45,297 --> 01:03:47,459
I know who
you can take to prom.

1295
01:03:50,417 --> 01:03:51,464
Who?

1296
01:03:53,897 --> 01:03:55,308
This sexy pillow here.

1297
01:03:55,377 --> 01:03:56,417
Oh, my God, can you just...

1298
01:03:56,457 --> 01:03:58,141
Ooh, Greg,

1299
01:03:58,257 --> 01:03:59,304
this pillow's name is Francesca.

1300
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:00,663
Don't joke,
I can't deal with that.

1301
01:04:00,737 --> 01:04:01,818
She's a filthy Italian woman.

1302
01:04:01,897 --> 01:04:02,898
Please, stop!

1303
01:04:04,577 --> 01:04:06,102
Don't yell at me.

1304
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:07,901
So, that's it?
Just, to hell with college,

1305
01:04:07,977 --> 01:04:08,978
to hell with growing up?

1306
01:04:09,057 --> 01:04:10,058
Greg, don't.

1307
01:04:10,137 --> 01:04:11,741
Rachel, what the hell
is wrong with you?

1308
01:04:11,817 --> 01:04:13,501
This is your life!

1309
01:04:14,577 --> 01:04:16,659
Yeah, it is my life.

1310
01:04:17,337 --> 01:04:19,738
It's me who has to
lie in bed all day,

1311
01:04:19,817 --> 01:04:20,898
with a shaved head...

1312
01:04:20,977 --> 01:04:22,741
...getting weaker and uglier,

1313
01:04:22,817 --> 01:04:25,900
and more miserable,
with no hope in sight.

1314
01:04:26,337 --> 01:04:28,101
I'm the one who
has to suffer through this,

1315
01:04:28,177 --> 01:04:30,418
not you, so don't yell at me.

1316
01:04:32,777 --> 01:04:34,939
I'm sorry,
but I'm not gonna sit here

1317
01:04:35,017 --> 01:04:37,304
and get comfortable
watching you die.

1318
01:04:39,017 --> 01:04:41,463
Okay? I'm not.
I'm not gonna do that.

1319
01:04:41,817 --> 01:04:43,660
So don't ask me to.

1320
01:04:44,497 --> 01:04:46,340
If you can't accept
that I'm going to do

1321
01:04:46,417 --> 01:04:48,863
what I want to do
with my life...

1322
01:04:49,857 --> 01:04:51,780
...then you're
a terrible friend.

1323
01:04:53,337 --> 01:04:54,987
I'm a terrible friend?

1324
01:04:55,137 --> 01:04:56,184
Okay.

1325
01:04:56,777 --> 01:04:58,188
You know,
I'm not the one giving up.

1326
01:04:58,337 --> 01:04:59,702
I'm not ruining my friend's life

1327
01:04:59,817 --> 01:05:01,307
by giving up
on the whole world.

1328
01:05:01,377 --> 01:05:03,300
Oh, please, Greg,
you should be overjoyed.

1329
01:05:03,377 --> 01:05:04,617
Now you can
go back to your life

1330
01:05:04,697 --> 01:05:07,143
of being invisible
and detached...

1331
01:05:07,217 --> 01:05:09,026
...and self-hating.

1332
01:05:11,537 --> 01:05:12,663
Yeah.

1333
01:05:13,777 --> 01:05:16,144
And you can go back
to your life of being dead.

1334
01:05:18,217 --> 01:05:20,219
Nice. Really nice.

1335
01:05:26,057 --> 01:05:28,025
This is gonna kill your mom.

1336
01:05:31,697 --> 01:05:33,859
Have you gotten
comfortable with that?

1337
01:05:37,737 --> 01:05:39,819
That doesn't
bother you anymore?

1338
01:05:39,897 --> 01:05:40,978
Thinking about your mom?

1339
01:05:41,057 --> 01:05:42,821
Get outta here, Greg.
You've done your time.

1340
01:05:42,897 --> 01:05:45,178
You don't have to hang around
with the sick girl anymore.

1341
01:05:49,577 --> 01:05:51,579
How can you even
say that to me?

1342
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:55,228
Your mom forced you
to hang out with me.

1343
01:05:55,377 --> 01:05:56,947
Earl forced you
to show me your movies.

1344
01:05:57,057 --> 01:05:59,185
Madison forced you
to make a movie about me.

1345
01:05:59,257 --> 01:06:01,942
So, what part of this
did you actually want to do?

1346
01:06:21,577 --> 01:06:24,228
Just... Just do something
nice for me for once

1347
01:06:24,297 --> 01:06:26,106
and just get out.

1348
01:06:51,657 --> 01:06:52,818
<i>Earl!</i>

1349
01:06:53,137 --> 01:06:55,504
This is it!
You've gone too far!

1350
01:06:55,657 --> 01:06:56,897
You've leaked
the unleakable secret

1351
01:06:56,977 --> 01:06:58,502
because you hold nothing sacred.

1352
01:06:58,617 --> 01:06:59,664
'Cause you're a dickhead!

1353
01:06:59,777 --> 01:07:00,824
The foundation of any

1354
01:07:00,937 --> 01:07:02,541
good working partnership
is trust...

1355
01:07:02,617 --> 01:07:04,426
...and I can no longer
trust you in any way.

1356
01:07:04,497 --> 01:07:05,737
You'll leak anything to anyone.

1357
01:07:05,817 --> 01:07:07,421
It's like working
with Julian Assange.

1358
01:07:07,497 --> 01:07:09,659
Assangde. Ass-andge.
Damn it!

1359
01:07:23,137 --> 01:07:24,502
The hell you want?

1360
01:07:24,937 --> 01:07:26,860
Just waiting for Earl.
Awright, awright.

1361
01:07:27,577 --> 01:07:29,102
Whassup, boy?
You gonna come in?

1362
01:07:29,257 --> 01:07:31,339
So, Rachel told me that
you told her about the, uh...

1363
01:07:31,697 --> 01:07:33,267
...about the film
that we're making for her.

1364
01:07:33,337 --> 01:07:34,338
Yeah?

1365
01:07:34,977 --> 01:07:36,945
You're like Julian Assange, man.

1366
01:07:37,097 --> 01:07:38,462
It's like you always do this...

1367
01:07:38,537 --> 01:07:39,737
I don't know,
'cause you, like,

1368
01:07:39,777 --> 01:07:41,381
wanna be a better friend
than me or something?

1369
01:07:41,457 --> 01:07:42,618
I don't know if I can
work with you again

1370
01:07:42,697 --> 01:07:43,903
after you sell me out
like a dick!

1371
01:07:43,977 --> 01:07:46,298
Oh, okay. Watch out, yo.

1372
01:07:47,217 --> 01:07:49,219
Hey, yo,
shut your ass up, man!

1373
01:07:49,297 --> 01:07:50,867
Like you care so much about
what other people think,

1374
01:07:50,977 --> 01:07:52,138
boy, you go around here...

1375
01:07:52,217 --> 01:07:53,298
...kissin' everybody ass,

1376
01:07:53,377 --> 01:07:54,458
pretending like
they your friend.

1377
01:07:54,537 --> 01:07:56,858
Look, nobody
gives a shit about you, Greg!

1378
01:07:57,017 --> 01:07:58,143
All right? Nobody give a shit!

1379
01:07:58,217 --> 01:07:59,218
Whoop his ass!

1380
01:07:59,337 --> 01:08:01,783
And then the one girl
who do actually care about you...

1381
01:08:01,897 --> 01:08:02,978
...you wanna come
over here and

1382
01:08:03,057 --> 01:08:05,537
bitch and whine
about some films, yo? Huh?

1383
01:08:05,657 --> 01:08:08,058
Because somebody
actually cares about you?

1384
01:08:08,137 --> 01:08:09,468
Like, damn,
I'm so tired of you

1385
01:08:09,537 --> 01:08:11,221
treating this girl
like she a burden.

1386
01:08:11,337 --> 01:08:13,305
You know,
her life is over after this!

1387
01:08:13,377 --> 01:08:14,537
And you want to
come over here

1388
01:08:14,577 --> 01:08:17,308
bitchin' and whinin' about
some irrelevant bullshit!

1389
01:08:17,377 --> 01:08:19,823
Like, yo, you so close to me
knocking your shit loose right now, son!

1390
01:08:19,897 --> 01:08:20,978
Go for it!

1391
01:08:21,057 --> 01:08:22,138
Oh, so you want me
to hit you now? Huh?

1392
01:08:22,217 --> 01:08:24,140
Yeah, I don't care!
You want me to hit you now?

1393
01:08:24,217 --> 01:08:25,577
Yeah, Earl, I want you to!

1394
01:08:25,857 --> 01:08:27,905
That's right! Jack that
little dude up there!

1395
01:08:33,417 --> 01:08:34,498
See, Greg?

1396
01:08:34,577 --> 01:08:36,898
You lucky that was him
and not me out there...

1397
01:08:37,017 --> 01:08:39,179
...'cause I'd have been whooping
your ass up and down this street.

1398
01:08:39,257 --> 01:08:41,457
It'd have been a ass-whoopin'
fest around here, you dig?

1399
01:08:50,337 --> 01:08:53,864
So what's the status on
the 20-pager on Nixon?

1400
01:08:54,937 --> 01:08:58,100
Uh, I need another extension.

1401
01:08:58,257 --> 01:09:00,498
That might prove difficult...

1402
01:09:00,617 --> 01:09:03,348
...seeing how it's the...

1403
01:09:03,457 --> 01:09:05,027
...the end of the quarter
and all.

1404
01:09:05,777 --> 01:09:08,747
Yeah, I've just been busy.

1405
01:09:10,657 --> 01:09:12,500
You know, I heard...

1406
01:09:15,897 --> 01:09:17,387
...about Rachel.

1407
01:09:18,457 --> 01:09:20,061
How you holding up?

1408
01:09:24,257 --> 01:09:25,258
You know...

1409
01:09:26,537 --> 01:09:28,062
...not great.

1410
01:09:33,377 --> 01:09:36,779
You know, my dad died
when I was 15, Greg.

1411
01:09:37,137 --> 01:09:39,139
A couple years younger than you.

1412
01:09:39,577 --> 01:09:42,820
You know, the thing is that,
when I was a kid...

1413
01:09:43,457 --> 01:09:46,142
...I really,
I really can only remember

1414
01:09:46,217 --> 01:09:48,060
thinking about him as this...

1415
01:09:48,137 --> 01:09:51,539
...you know, big,
kind of like asshole guy.

1416
01:09:53,017 --> 01:09:55,258
At his wake,
these buddies of his

1417
01:09:55,337 --> 01:09:56,384
kept coming up to me...

1418
01:09:56,457 --> 01:09:59,142
...and telling me
these stories about him.

1419
01:09:59,337 --> 01:10:01,465
And it was like
they were talking about

1420
01:10:01,537 --> 01:10:03,380
some complete other guy.

1421
01:10:04,777 --> 01:10:06,586
To give you an example.

1422
01:10:07,257 --> 01:10:10,466
He knew every single
European pop song

1423
01:10:10,537 --> 01:10:11,868
from the 1970s.

1424
01:10:12,017 --> 01:10:13,018
Every single one.

1425
01:10:14,097 --> 01:10:15,337
He'd memorize these songs,

1426
01:10:15,417 --> 01:10:17,260
and he'd do that
so he could go...

1427
01:10:17,417 --> 01:10:20,307
...and sing them
to German girls in bars.

1428
01:10:21,337 --> 01:10:22,623
He had a go-to,

1429
01:10:22,697 --> 01:10:25,223
his number one
go-to song. It was a...

1430
01:10:26,217 --> 01:10:30,427
It was a Dutch song.
It was called <i>Ding-a-Dong.</i>

1431
01:10:32,097 --> 01:10:35,738
My dad used to sing that
to German girls in bars.

1432
01:10:36,937 --> 01:10:38,621
That's a fact.

1433
01:10:42,217 --> 01:10:44,026
So what does that mean?

1434
01:10:46,457 --> 01:10:49,381
Well, Greg, I think that
it just means that...

1435
01:10:50,417 --> 01:10:52,897
...even after somebody dies,
you can...

1436
01:10:53,777 --> 01:10:56,098
...you can still
keep learning about them.

1437
01:10:57,137 --> 01:10:59,868
You know, their life.

1438
01:11:01,617 --> 01:11:04,860
It can keep unfolding
itself to you just as long...

1439
01:11:05,817 --> 01:11:08,343
...just as long as
you pay attention to it.

1440
01:11:09,577 --> 01:11:10,908
Are you seriously
trying to turn this

1441
01:11:10,977 --> 01:11:13,298
into some stupid sappy lesson?

1442
01:11:15,657 --> 01:11:17,227
You're a good kid, Greg.

1443
01:11:17,297 --> 01:11:19,823
No! Look, I'm going home.

1444
01:11:21,217 --> 01:11:23,823
See, I'm cutting class
right in front of you. 'Kay?

1445
01:11:23,897 --> 01:11:26,662
I'm not a good kid. I'm not.

1446
01:11:43,737 --> 01:11:44,738
Okay.

1447
01:11:45,537 --> 01:11:47,665
Earl came by earlier
to drop something off...

1448
01:11:47,737 --> 01:11:49,865
...but he turned down
this superb

1449
01:11:49,937 --> 01:11:51,985
Andouille rabbit sausage...

1450
01:11:52,137 --> 01:11:54,105
...which is quite unlike him.

1451
01:11:55,137 --> 01:11:56,787
Is everything all right?

1452
01:11:58,257 --> 01:11:59,418
Buddy?

1453
01:12:15,497 --> 01:12:17,181
<i>Hey, Rachel. Uh...</i>

1454
01:12:18,137 --> 01:12:19,417
<i>We tried a lot of different ways</i>

1455
01:12:19,457 --> 01:12:21,141
<i>of making a film for you...</i>

1456
01:12:21,217 --> 01:12:24,061
<i>...but they were all
too goofy or irrelevant...</i>

1457
01:12:24,217 --> 01:12:25,821
<i>...or just not what we wanted.</i>

1458
01:12:25,977 --> 01:12:28,583
<i>So, now I'm gonna
talk to you directly.</i>

1459
01:12:29,297 --> 01:12:30,298
<i>Um...</i>

1460
01:12:30,697 --> 01:12:32,984
<i>All right, I'm gonna be
honest here. Okay?</i>

1461
01:12:33,137 --> 01:12:35,265
<i>Sometimes, white girls
are particularly stupid.</i>

1462
01:12:35,377 --> 01:12:39,780
<i>I mean, everybody's stupid,
but white girls, you know...</i>

1463
01:12:39,857 --> 01:12:41,541
<i>They think
they better than everybody</i>

1464
01:12:41,617 --> 01:12:44,223
<i>and self-centered
and pretend they not.</i>

1465
01:12:44,297 --> 01:12:45,981
<i>But...</i>

1466
01:12:46,097 --> 01:12:48,668
<i>You aren't like that,
you know. Um...</i>

1467
01:12:48,737 --> 01:12:50,626
<i>It's just crazy
how patient you've been.</i>

1468
01:12:50,697 --> 01:12:53,541
<i>You know, I know if it was me
that had cancer, uh...</i>

1469
01:12:54,417 --> 01:12:56,738
<i>...I'd be upset and angry</i>

1470
01:12:56,857 --> 01:12:59,337
<i>and trying to beat
everybody's ass half the time.</i>

1471
01:12:59,777 --> 01:13:03,543
<i>So I'm just, I'm just amazed
at how patient you've been.</i>

1472
01:13:05,857 --> 01:13:08,098
<i>You, you make me feel blessed.</i>

1473
01:13:17,697 --> 01:13:18,983
Tales of Hoffmann <i>is a film</i>

1474
01:13:19,057 --> 01:13:21,537
<i>by Michael Powell
and Emeric Pressburger.</i>

1475
01:13:22,737 --> 01:13:24,577
<i>I think, ultimately,
what one has to understand</i>

1476
01:13:24,617 --> 01:13:25,948
<i>watching this film...</i>

1477
01:13:26,017 --> 01:13:28,827
<i>...it's a very special
piece of filmmaking.</i>

1478
01:13:28,897 --> 01:13:29,898
Oh.

1479
01:13:30,457 --> 01:13:32,425
Are you eating lunch
in here still?

1480
01:13:33,377 --> 01:13:34,663
Not if you are.

1481
01:13:35,257 --> 01:13:37,100
Well, I'm not eating
lunch in here if you are.

1482
01:13:38,137 --> 01:13:40,663
Good, 'cause I like it in here.

1483
01:13:41,097 --> 01:13:43,304
So I guess I could just go.

1484
01:13:44,177 --> 01:13:45,303
Or you could go.

1485
01:13:45,937 --> 01:13:48,668
No, I like
the air-conditioner.

1486
01:13:48,737 --> 01:13:50,580
And I like
the comfortable chair.

1487
01:13:54,497 --> 01:13:56,818
Yeah, I like those too.

1488
01:13:57,697 --> 01:14:00,098
Sounds like your damn problem.

1489
01:14:01,817 --> 01:14:04,058
<i>...which showed
one film per week...</i>

1490
01:14:04,257 --> 01:14:07,022
<i>...twice a night,
and three times on Saturday.</i>

1491
01:14:07,697 --> 01:14:09,745
<i>In a way,</i>
Tales of Hoffmann<i> is...</i>

1492
01:14:10,897 --> 01:14:13,548
<i>...the culmination of
Powell-Pressburger's work...</i>

1493
01:14:13,697 --> 01:14:16,348
<i>...with what they call
the composed film.</i>

1494
01:14:37,697 --> 01:14:38,698
Hey!

1495
01:14:39,177 --> 01:14:40,542
Can I talk to you
about the movie?

1496
01:14:41,297 --> 01:14:42,378
Um...

1497
01:14:42,457 --> 01:14:44,027
Yeah, it's not done yet.

1498
01:14:44,217 --> 01:14:45,423
Greg, you guys
have been working on it

1499
01:14:45,497 --> 01:14:46,908
for like four months.

1500
01:14:48,177 --> 01:14:49,383
Yeah, well...

1501
01:14:49,897 --> 01:14:51,183
I don't know,
we tried a bunch of stuff

1502
01:14:51,257 --> 01:14:53,100
and it just...

1503
01:14:53,497 --> 01:14:54,544
...didn't really work.

1504
01:14:54,617 --> 01:14:55,657
It's not that good.

1505
01:14:55,777 --> 01:14:56,824
Greg!

1506
01:14:57,017 --> 01:14:59,588
Now is not the time for your
"I'm Greg, I suck,

1507
01:14:59,657 --> 01:15:01,147
"nothing I do
is any good" thing.

1508
01:15:01,297 --> 01:15:02,423
I'm sure what you have
is awesome

1509
01:15:02,497 --> 01:15:04,386
and I think she would
really benefit...

1510
01:15:04,457 --> 01:15:06,937
...if you just got it done
and gave it to her.

1511
01:15:07,817 --> 01:15:09,785
Madison,
she stopped treatment.

1512
01:15:12,897 --> 01:15:14,023
She gave up.

1513
01:15:16,097 --> 01:15:17,622
She quit.

1514
01:15:19,617 --> 01:15:20,982
Well, I guess
that's a really good reason

1515
01:15:21,057 --> 01:15:22,582
to just finish
the fucking movie.

1516
01:15:22,657 --> 01:15:24,102
And give it to her.

1517
01:15:26,257 --> 01:15:27,588
But whatever.

1518
01:15:40,537 --> 01:15:41,902
Honey?

1519
01:15:43,577 --> 01:15:44,658
What?

1520
01:15:50,297 --> 01:15:52,618
Rachel's back
in the hospital, honey.

1521
01:15:56,737 --> 01:15:59,058
Wait, is she starting
treatment again?

1522
01:16:01,417 --> 01:16:03,545
It's not for treatment, honey.

1523
01:16:08,657 --> 01:16:09,658
Oh.

1524
01:16:13,337 --> 01:16:14,782
Mom, what?

1525
01:16:15,497 --> 01:16:16,828
Well, I thought
we could go and...

1526
01:16:16,897 --> 01:16:17,978
You just thought
this was your last chance

1527
01:16:18,057 --> 01:16:20,105
to force me
to hang out with her?

1528
01:16:20,177 --> 01:16:21,178
Greg, come on.

1529
01:16:21,257 --> 01:16:22,338
Don't worry, Mom,
I'm sure you can find

1530
01:16:22,417 --> 01:16:24,704
another girl with cancer
after Rachel dies.

1531
01:16:26,097 --> 01:16:28,020
Which, by the way...

1532
01:16:28,377 --> 01:16:30,186
...she's decided to do.

1533
01:16:32,297 --> 01:16:34,743
She's just decided to die...

1534
01:16:34,817 --> 01:16:37,627
...so maybe I can decide
not to visit her.

1535
01:16:42,977 --> 01:16:45,947
I promise you,
you will regret that...

1536
01:16:46,097 --> 01:16:47,178
...if you don't visit her.

1537
01:16:48,417 --> 01:16:50,226
You'll regret it
for the rest of your life.

1538
01:16:50,377 --> 01:16:51,788
Mom, that's probably true.

1539
01:16:51,937 --> 01:16:53,348
But honestly,
I have a shitload of things

1540
01:16:53,417 --> 01:16:54,862
to regret right now.

1541
01:16:55,017 --> 01:16:57,497
I regret not having a date
for tomorrow's stupid prom.

1542
01:16:57,577 --> 01:17:00,228
I regret being too weird
to make friends.

1543
01:17:00,377 --> 01:17:01,424
I definitely regret making

1544
01:17:01,497 --> 01:17:02,783
all those shitty films
with Earl.

1545
01:17:02,897 --> 01:17:05,423
And I assume you saw
the email I got today, from Pitt?

1546
01:17:06,697 --> 01:17:07,983
Oh, no? You didn't see it

1547
01:17:08,057 --> 01:17:09,821
while you're going though
all my shit? Here.

1548
01:17:10,057 --> 01:17:11,627
Have a look.

1549
01:17:11,817 --> 01:17:12,943
I'm definitely gonna regret

1550
01:17:13,017 --> 01:17:14,940
doing literally
no school work this year!

1551
01:17:15,257 --> 01:17:16,418
Oh, my God, Greg.

1552
01:17:16,497 --> 01:17:18,181
I know. Admission rescinded,

1553
01:17:18,257 --> 01:17:20,544
due to significant change
in my academic record.

1554
01:17:20,617 --> 01:17:22,107
Oh, well,
no college next year.

1555
01:17:22,177 --> 01:17:24,225
I guess I'll just be home,
which sucks for you...

1556
01:17:24,297 --> 01:17:25,298
...because it's gonna be
so hard for you

1557
01:17:25,417 --> 01:17:26,907
to go through all my stuff.

1558
01:17:26,977 --> 01:17:28,706
Can you just do me a favor
right now, Mom?

1559
01:17:28,777 --> 01:17:30,063
Just leave me alone. Okay?

1560
01:17:30,137 --> 01:17:31,980
Just let me sit here
and regret stuff.

1561
01:17:32,057 --> 01:17:33,097
I'm just gonna think about

1562
01:17:33,177 --> 01:17:34,224
all the things
that I've ever done...

1563
01:17:34,297 --> 01:17:35,583
...and all the things
I haven't done

1564
01:17:35,657 --> 01:17:38,342
and just regret the living shit out of it.
Okay?

1565
01:17:43,137 --> 01:17:45,424
All the deadlines
have passed, Victor.

1566
01:17:45,577 --> 01:17:46,783
What's he gonna do next year?

1567
01:17:46,897 --> 01:17:48,137
He's just gonna waste the year?

1568
01:17:48,177 --> 01:17:49,542
He is grieving, honey.

1569
01:17:49,617 --> 01:17:50,778
You have to let him grieve.

1570
01:17:50,937 --> 01:17:51,938
But I can't just sit by

1571
01:17:52,017 --> 01:17:53,382
and just let him ruin his life.

1572
01:17:53,457 --> 01:17:54,458
That's not what I'm saying.

1573
01:17:54,537 --> 01:17:55,538
Well, he's doing it.

1574
01:17:55,657 --> 01:17:56,738
The universe does not operate

1575
01:17:56,817 --> 01:17:58,626
according to a college deadline!

1576
01:18:17,737 --> 01:18:19,017
Can I ask you something?

1577
01:18:20,537 --> 01:18:21,538
Nope.

1578
01:18:21,697 --> 01:18:23,062
No. It's not what you think.

1579
01:18:23,137 --> 01:18:24,263
It's just that
prom is tonight and...

1580
01:18:24,337 --> 01:18:27,068
Let me ask you something.
What is this?

1581
01:18:27,617 --> 01:18:29,506
What is up
with the arm touching?

1582
01:18:29,577 --> 01:18:30,624
Are you just being friendly,

1583
01:18:30,697 --> 01:18:31,903
or is this some
calculated maneuver...

1584
01:18:31,977 --> 01:18:33,581
...to get me to do
whatever you want?

1585
01:18:33,657 --> 01:18:34,704
'Cause you have to understand

1586
01:18:34,777 --> 01:18:36,461
what it does
when a beautiful, sexy...

1587
01:18:36,537 --> 01:18:37,737
...otherwise
thoughtful girl...

1588
01:18:37,817 --> 01:18:39,819
...touches the arm
of a scrawny, pasty

1589
01:18:39,897 --> 01:18:41,023
groundhog-faced kid.

1590
01:18:41,097 --> 01:18:42,428
It's an act of cruelty.

1591
01:18:43,297 --> 01:18:45,743
Are you done?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm done.

1592
01:18:45,897 --> 01:18:47,308
I'm done with you.

1593
01:18:47,417 --> 01:18:49,704
I'm done with this stupid film.

1594
01:18:49,777 --> 01:18:51,461
All right? I'm done.

1595
01:18:52,497 --> 01:18:53,783
Yo! But you ain't
done with me!

1596
01:18:54,097 --> 01:18:55,701
<i>I'm back for my revenge</i>

1597
01:18:55,777 --> 01:18:57,017
<i>Stab you in the dick</i>

1598
01:18:57,217 --> 01:18:58,264
<i>Pardon my French</i>

1599
01:18:58,417 --> 01:19:01,148
Really? You're gonna stab me
in the dick? Go ahead.

1600
01:19:01,217 --> 01:19:02,218
Stab me in the dick.

1601
01:19:02,297 --> 01:19:04,584
Just no rapping.
Okay? All right?

1602
01:19:04,657 --> 01:19:06,944
<i>I'll break your eyeball
with a fist I got clenched</i>

1603
01:19:08,137 --> 01:19:09,627
<i>Shove your body
under another bench</i>

1604
01:19:09,697 --> 01:19:10,858
Stop rapping!

1605
01:19:11,017 --> 01:19:12,860
<i>Knock your teeth out
with the fist I got clenched</i>

1606
01:19:12,937 --> 01:19:14,937
I can't do this if you're
gonna rap the whole time.

1607
01:19:32,617 --> 01:19:33,903
Aw!

1608
01:19:36,497 --> 01:19:37,623
Break it up!

1609
01:19:37,777 --> 01:19:38,778
Earl!

1610
01:19:38,937 --> 01:19:41,258
Break it up! Break it up!

1611
01:19:41,337 --> 01:19:42,384
I thought you were
eating lunch

1612
01:19:42,457 --> 01:19:43,504
in Mr. McCarthy's office.

1613
01:19:43,577 --> 01:19:44,897
Man, I was,
but he all sad talking

1614
01:19:44,937 --> 01:19:46,057
about German music and shit.

1615
01:19:46,137 --> 01:19:47,866
That's boring as hell, man.

1616
01:19:47,977 --> 01:19:50,628
I'm surprised and disappointed to
see you two fighting.

1617
01:19:50,697 --> 01:19:52,347
And, Phillip, I'm surprised
and disappointed

1618
01:19:52,417 --> 01:19:53,828
to see you
back on school grounds...

1619
01:19:53,977 --> 01:19:55,502
...after being expelled!

1620
01:19:55,577 --> 01:19:56,578
All right, man.

1621
01:19:56,657 --> 01:19:57,738
Please leave the premises.

1622
01:19:57,817 --> 01:19:59,148
Back to class.

1623
01:19:59,217 --> 01:20:00,378
Let's go!

1624
01:20:00,537 --> 01:20:02,426
Maxwell, Ryan, Soledad,

1625
01:20:02,497 --> 01:20:04,738
stop gawking and start walking!

1626
01:20:09,977 --> 01:20:11,183
Greg!

1627
01:20:11,377 --> 01:20:13,823
Yo, babe!
You see me pummel this bitch?

1628
01:20:13,977 --> 01:20:15,024
Come on and keep walking

1629
01:20:15,097 --> 01:20:16,747
'fore I can whoop
that ass again, man.

1630
01:20:16,897 --> 01:20:18,467
Madison, what?

1631
01:20:19,297 --> 01:20:20,867
Come to prom with me.

1632
01:20:22,937 --> 01:20:24,462
I know the whole movie situation

1633
01:20:24,537 --> 01:20:26,107
was really difficult for you...

1634
01:20:26,257 --> 01:20:28,225
...and I kind of feel like
it was my fault.

1635
01:20:29,257 --> 01:20:30,258
So I just kind of wanted to

1636
01:20:30,337 --> 01:20:31,987
make it up to you a little bit.

1637
01:20:34,217 --> 01:20:36,106
Is this a pity date?

1638
01:20:36,177 --> 01:20:37,178
No.

1639
01:20:37,257 --> 01:20:38,986
No, it's not a pity date.

1640
01:20:40,457 --> 01:20:41,822
Greg, just come to prom with me.

1641
01:20:41,897 --> 01:20:43,342
I think we'd have a good time.

1642
01:20:46,177 --> 01:20:48,339
Told you
you would get a date.

1643
01:20:49,137 --> 01:20:50,138
Yep.

1644
01:20:55,537 --> 01:20:58,780
So you're welcome.
For the tux and everything.

1645
01:20:59,977 --> 01:21:01,342
Thanks, Mom.

1646
01:21:16,137 --> 01:21:19,380
I'm very upset
about this college thing.

1647
01:21:20,937 --> 01:21:22,223
But your father and I can wait

1648
01:21:22,297 --> 01:21:24,186
till you're ready
to talk about it.

1649
01:21:26,457 --> 01:21:27,982
I appreciate that.

1650
01:21:30,777 --> 01:21:32,779
Don't forget your corsage.

1651
01:21:35,817 --> 01:21:36,818
All right.

1652
01:21:42,417 --> 01:21:44,738
My handsome boy...

1653
01:21:44,897 --> 01:21:46,661
...going to prom.

1654
01:21:49,297 --> 01:21:51,584
Take lots of pictures, okay?

1655
01:22:10,257 --> 01:22:11,543
302 Halket Street.

1656
01:22:11,817 --> 01:22:13,057
What's that?

1657
01:22:13,217 --> 01:22:14,901
I said 302 Halket Street.

1658
01:22:15,457 --> 01:22:18,108
Huh?
302 Halket Street.

1659
01:22:18,257 --> 01:22:19,986
Halket? Okay.
Okay.

1660
01:22:20,137 --> 01:22:21,548
You got it, baby.

1661
01:22:21,697 --> 01:22:23,540
So you love this girl?

1662
01:22:24,817 --> 01:22:27,058
Uh, no.
I wouldn't go that far.

1663
01:22:27,337 --> 01:22:28,384
What?

1664
01:22:28,537 --> 01:22:29,982
No. I... No.

1665
01:22:30,177 --> 01:22:31,417
Yeah, so you guys
are gonna be getting busy

1666
01:22:31,497 --> 01:22:33,386
on my brand new Tuscan leather?

1667
01:22:33,537 --> 01:22:35,187
No. I think-
Huh?

1668
01:22:35,337 --> 01:22:37,021
No, we're not.
I don't think so.

1669
01:22:37,097 --> 01:22:39,020
Nah, I'm just playing with you.

1670
01:22:39,177 --> 01:22:40,747
But I do hope you get some.

1671
01:22:40,937 --> 01:22:42,985
It's really gonna depend
on what she wants to do.

1672
01:22:43,057 --> 01:22:44,058
If you really love her,
though,

1673
01:22:44,137 --> 01:22:45,468
you definitely got a shot.

1674
01:22:45,617 --> 01:22:47,301
Because she'll know.

1675
01:22:48,057 --> 01:22:49,786
She is fine though?

1676
01:22:51,377 --> 01:22:52,378
Huh?

1677
01:23:55,177 --> 01:23:56,338
Hey.

1678
01:23:59,937 --> 01:24:01,507
I know, I look amazing.

1679
01:24:06,217 --> 01:24:08,185
Can I put some flowers on you?

1680
01:24:23,177 --> 01:24:24,861
Like that.

1681
01:24:32,777 --> 01:24:33,858
Okay.

1682
01:24:34,737 --> 01:24:36,785
Before we watch this...

1683
01:24:37,297 --> 01:24:39,538
...I'm sorry
it took so long to make.

1684
01:24:39,697 --> 01:24:41,540
But the reason is...

1685
01:24:41,937 --> 01:24:45,259
...just couldn't figure out
how to get it to not suck.

1686
01:24:46,217 --> 01:24:49,505
But... we never really
did figure it out.

1687
01:24:49,577 --> 01:24:51,102
It still sucks.

1688
01:24:51,977 --> 01:24:53,547
And, um, it's...

1689
01:24:55,217 --> 01:24:57,948
It's not exactly
what I wanted to say to you.

1690
01:25:04,617 --> 01:25:05,618
But...

1691
01:25:06,937 --> 01:25:08,268
...whatever.

1692
01:25:08,577 --> 01:25:10,739
Let's just
watch this first, okay?

1693
01:28:24,097 --> 01:28:25,940
Hey, should I get a nurse?

1694
01:28:27,817 --> 01:28:29,945
Denise! Denise!

1695
01:29:41,777 --> 01:29:44,348
<i>That was the last time
I saw Rachel.</i>

1696
01:29:45,177 --> 01:29:47,657
<i>She went into a coma
shortly after that,</i>

1697
01:29:47,737 --> 01:29:49,341
<i>and died about 10 hours later.</i>

1698
01:29:52,177 --> 01:29:54,544
<i>I know I told you
she doesn't die.</i>

1699
01:29:55,057 --> 01:29:56,582
<i>And I'm sorry.</i>

1700
01:29:57,057 --> 01:29:58,218
<i>Deep down...</i>

1701
01:29:58,577 --> 01:30:01,581
<i>...somehow,
I didn't think she would.</i>

1702
01:30:03,097 --> 01:30:04,622
<i>But she did.</i>

1703
01:33:30,777 --> 01:33:32,825
<i>Dear Greg,
I heard what happened</i>

1704
01:33:32,897 --> 01:33:34,137
<i>with your class work.</i>

1705
01:33:34,297 --> 01:33:35,947
<i>And with Pitt State.</i>

1706
01:33:36,497 --> 01:33:38,226
<i>So, I wrote them a letter,</i>

1707
01:33:38,297 --> 01:33:40,504
<i>trying to convince them
to let you back in.</i>

1708
01:33:41,177 --> 01:33:43,578
<i>There's a copy in here,
if you want to read it.</i>

1709
01:33:44,257 --> 01:33:46,100
<i>Hopefully, it works,
because that would mean...</i>

1710
01:33:46,177 --> 01:33:48,862
<i>...I have powers
from beyond the grave.</i>

1711
01:33:49,017 --> 01:33:51,588
<i>But you should probably
send them something too.</i>

1712
01:33:52,977 --> 01:33:55,947
<i>Goodbye, Greg.
You're a good friend.</i>

1713
01:33:56,337 --> 01:33:57,623
<i>Although if you don't
go to college,</i>

1714
01:33:57,697 --> 01:33:58,983
<i>you're also an idiot.</i>

1715
01:33:59,137 --> 01:34:01,139
<i>But you already knew that.</i>

1716
01:34:01,977 --> 01:34:03,308
<i>Love, Rachel.</i>

1717
01:34:04,937 --> 01:34:08,464
<i>P.S.: I'd also like for you
to take some of my pillows.</i>

1718
01:34:08,617 --> 01:34:11,097
<i>They'll want a good home
where they'll be loved.</i>

1719
01:34:11,297 --> 01:34:13,379
<i>P.P.S.: Not in the way
you're thinking,</i>

1720
01:34:13,457 --> 01:34:14,458
<i>that's disgusting.</i>

1721
01:37:49,497 --> 01:37:51,659
<i>Dear Pittsburgh
State Admissions:</i>

1722
01:37:51,817 --> 01:37:53,307
<i>I'm writing on behalf of someone</i>

1723
01:37:53,377 --> 01:37:55,186
<i>who gave me
half a year of his life...</i>

1724
01:37:55,297 --> 01:37:56,417
<i>...at the time when I was at</i>

1725
01:37:56,457 --> 01:37:58,664
<i>my most difficult to be around.</i>

1726
01:37:58,857 --> 01:38:00,825
<i>He has a very
low opinion of himself,</i>

1727
01:38:00,897 --> 01:38:02,103
<i>which is why
I think it's necessary...</i>

1728
01:38:02,177 --> 01:38:03,337
<i>...that you hear from someone</i>

1729
01:38:03,377 --> 01:38:05,345
<i>who sees him
as he actually is:</i>

1730
01:38:05,497 --> 01:38:07,977
<i>A limitlessly kind,
sweet, giving,</i>

1731
01:38:08,057 --> 01:38:09,661
<i>and genuine person.</i>

1732
01:38:09,817 --> 01:38:11,979
<i>No matter how much
he would deny it.</i>

1733
01:38:12,657 --> 01:38:14,944
<i>The drop in his academic
performance this year...</i>

1734
01:38:15,017 --> 01:38:16,143
<i>...is the consequence
of all the time</i>

1735
01:38:16,217 --> 01:38:17,264
<i>he spent with me...</i>

1736
01:38:17,377 --> 01:38:19,778
<i>...and the time he spent
making things for me...</i>

1737
01:38:19,857 --> 01:38:22,098
<i>...and how hard
that was for him.</i>

1738
01:38:22,217 --> 01:38:23,901
<i>You can ask him about it...</i>

1739
01:38:23,977 --> 01:38:26,139
<i>...but his sort of
over-the-top humility</i>

1740
01:38:26,217 --> 01:38:27,981
<i>will probably get in the way.</i>

1741
01:38:28,897 --> 01:38:32,026
<i>No one has done more
to make me smile than he has.</i>

1742
01:38:32,177 --> 01:38:33,861
<i>And no one ever could.</i>

1743
01:38:51,617 --> 01:38:52,977
<i>Rachel's ashes were scattered</i>

1744
01:38:53,057 --> 01:38:55,105
<i>in a park behind her house.</i>

1745
01:38:55,737 --> 01:38:57,501
<i>Apparently, she ran away
from home once</i>

1746
01:38:57,577 --> 01:38:59,386
<i>and tried to live there.</i>

1747
01:39:00,617 --> 01:39:03,541
<i>It was this story
her aunt told at the funeral.</i>

1748
01:39:03,697 --> 01:39:06,064
<i>She was trying
to become a squirrel.</i>

1749
01:39:06,737 --> 01:39:08,097
<i>She thought she could
turn into one</i>

1750
01:39:08,137 --> 01:39:09,423
<i>just by being in the forest...</i>

1751
01:39:09,577 --> 01:39:11,739
<i>...and wanting it really bad.</i>

1752
01:39:12,457 --> 01:39:15,540
<i>I guess maybe that's
what Mr. McCarthy meant...</i>

1753
01:39:15,697 --> 01:39:18,701
<i>...about someone's life
continuing to unfold.</i>

1754
01:39:19,737 --> 01:39:21,341
<i>It was weird to be
learning something new</i>

1755
01:39:21,417 --> 01:39:23,419
<i>about Rachel after she died.</i>

1756
01:39:24,377 --> 01:39:27,267
<i>But somehow,
it was reassuring as well.</i>
