1
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:29,503
Oh, no, oh, no

2
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:38,826
Ahhh, oh, no, ahhh, oh, no

3
00:00:38,906 --> 00:00:41,996
Ahhh, oh, no

4
00:00:42,076 --> 00:00:47,528
No, she don't mess around
No, she don't mess around

5
00:00:51,754 --> 00:00:54,166
100% blue agave.

6
00:00:54,724 --> 00:00:55,745
Taste it.

7
00:00:55,825 --> 00:00:57,429
Look, Mike, I like you.

8
00:00:57,593 --> 00:00:59,903
But no one's looking
for another brand of tequila.

9
00:01:00,063 --> 00:01:01,337
They've got the three... What is it?

10
00:01:01,497 --> 00:01:03,374
The Cuervo, the other one,
and the third one.

11
00:01:03,599 --> 00:01:05,078
And they don't need more tequila.

12
00:01:05,234 --> 00:01:08,076
- If I can't sell it, it's not gonna sell.
- People want the new-new.

13
00:01:08,237 --> 00:01:09,614
- The "new-new"?
- The "new-new."

14
00:01:09,772 --> 00:01:10,893
They want that new-new.

15
00:01:10,973 --> 00:01:11,995
No!

16
00:01:12,075 --> 00:01:14,578
What if I could sell this tequila
to a customer?

17
00:01:14,744 --> 00:01:16,815
- Would I have your order then?
- Yeah, sure.

18
00:01:16,946 --> 00:01:18,653
And I'm just gonna pick a customer
at random.

19
00:01:19,982 --> 00:01:20,983
Excuse me, sir.

20
00:01:21,217 --> 00:01:23,220
Do you enjoy the taste of tequila?

21
00:01:24,221 --> 00:01:25,292
Why, yes, I do.

22
00:01:25,457 --> 00:01:28,666
But I only drink my particular brand,
and you will not convince me otherwise.

23
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,803
- It's a perfect candidate.
- Because it's your brother!

24
00:01:31,062 --> 00:01:32,166
I know that's your brother.

25
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,636
He dated my niece.

26
00:01:33,765 --> 00:01:34,800
Look, mate, I don't know your niece.

27
00:01:35,033 --> 00:01:36,808
- Okay.
- But if I did...

28
00:01:36,968 --> 00:01:39,778
I'd say she was a little clingy,
and she'd freak a lot of people out.

29
00:01:39,938 --> 00:01:41,713
We play Wards With Friends
together, right?

30
00:01:41,873 --> 00:01:44,877
- Dave, right?
- Name's Rick. Just got in from Melbourne.

31
00:01:45,043 --> 00:01:46,044
His name's Rick.

32
00:01:46,211 --> 00:01:47,417
I know he's your brother.

33
00:01:47,645 --> 00:01:49,955
Look, look, look.
You guys are funny, you're weird.

34
00:01:50,115 --> 00:01:51,458
We do this every couple weeks...

35
00:01:52,884 --> 00:01:54,105
All right, I'll take 10 cases.

36
00:01:54,185 --> 00:01:55,186
- Fuck, yes!
- Yes!

37
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,321
Yes! I knew it!

38
00:01:56,554 --> 00:01:58,710
- We sold your ass, Randy!
- I don't know if that's what happened.

39
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,098
- It was the hat, right?
- Was it the hat?

40
00:02:00,191 --> 00:02:01,192
I just found this over there.

41
00:02:08,135 --> 00:02:09,273
Do something crazy

42
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,505
Live like it's Mardi Gras

43
00:02:11,605 --> 00:02:13,260
And go jump, make the party start

44
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,228
Don't need no R&R

45
00:02:15,308 --> 00:02:17,151
To regular life, I say Au revoir

46
00:02:17,244 --> 00:02:19,566
Yay! Living life in the fast lane

47
00:02:19,646 --> 00:02:21,182
Now your pain only be champagne

48
00:02:21,281 --> 00:02:24,819
So please come join me
One thing, good vibes only

49
00:02:25,285 --> 00:02:28,858
Start the keg, I'mma fill my cup

50
00:02:28,955 --> 00:02:32,334
Got fireworks, got booze
Let's blow some shit up

51
00:02:33,126 --> 00:02:34,867
Tonight I'm going stupid

52
00:02:34,961 --> 00:02:36,599
Doing things I've never done

53
00:02:37,097 --> 00:02:39,286
We all got one thing in common

54
00:02:39,366 --> 00:02:41,210
We just wanna have fun

55
00:02:44,306 --> 00:02:45,512
Do something crazy

56
00:02:46,608 --> 00:02:47,609
Okay

57
00:02:48,343 --> 00:02:49,344
Do something crazy

58
00:02:52,281 --> 00:02:53,282
Do what you wanna do

59
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:57,219
Do something crazy

60
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:01,223
I'm about to do

61
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:03,292
I'm about to do

62
00:03:04,326 --> 00:03:05,327
Do something crazy

63
00:03:05,994 --> 00:03:06,995
Do something crazy

64
00:03:07,196 --> 00:03:09,233
Do something wild

65
00:03:09,331 --> 00:03:10,867
Rolling with the homies

66
00:03:10,966 --> 00:03:12,988
Chicks by my side

67
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:15,207
Live for the moment

68
00:03:15,304 --> 00:03:17,079
All of the time

69
00:03:17,172 --> 00:03:19,083
Turn up the music

70
00:03:19,174 --> 00:03:20,882
Only good vibes

71
00:03:21,344 --> 00:03:22,833
Sorry to throw the accent at you, bro.

72
00:03:22,913 --> 00:03:24,415
No, dude. I loved it,
and it kept me in the now.

73
00:03:24,748 --> 00:03:27,524
Do you realize that that sale puts us
at number three in the office?

74
00:03:27,685 --> 00:03:30,187
The Stangle bros are killing it right now!

75
00:03:30,421 --> 00:03:32,492
It's not an actual hat.
They just call it a jimmy hat.

76
00:03:32,656 --> 00:03:33,828
If you wear two, they break.

77
00:03:33,991 --> 00:03:36,096
- It's an urban legend...
- No, it's not.

78
00:03:37,194 --> 00:03:38,229
Mom, Dad?

79
00:03:39,063 --> 00:03:40,235
Jeanie. Eric.

80
00:03:40,397 --> 00:03:43,241
Don't freak out.
I don't want you to freak out.

81
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,470
Just come on in.

82
00:03:44,735 --> 00:03:46,590
Why don't we all just sit down?

83
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:47,671
We gotta talk to you.

84
00:03:48,806 --> 00:03:50,149
We wanna discuss
Jeanie and Eric's wedding.

85
00:03:50,407 --> 00:03:51,511
- Oh! Sweet.
- Okay.

86
00:03:51,675 --> 00:03:54,121
Are you guys thinking DJ or band?
First thought, band, right?

87
00:03:54,278 --> 00:03:55,848
No. People want to hear the real songs.

88
00:03:56,013 --> 00:03:58,289
You don't want to hear a guy
singing Beyoncé.

89
00:03:58,382 --> 00:03:59,671
You just want to hear Beyoncé.

90
00:03:59,751 --> 00:04:00,739
Oh.

91
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:03,009
Yeah, but we want to talk about...

92
00:04:03,089 --> 00:04:04,898
is you two.

93
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:07,770
Now, over the years...

94
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,973
a theme has emerged
at our family gatherings.

95
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,507
Everyone's having a good time...

96
00:04:12,798 --> 00:04:14,987
- That's right.
- Things are going smoothly.

97
00:04:15,067 --> 00:04:16,189
Party time.

98
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:18,324
And then you two show up...

99
00:04:18,404 --> 00:04:19,405
stag...

100
00:04:19,705 --> 00:04:20,740
and you hit on girls...

101
00:04:20,973 --> 00:04:22,043
you act like idiots...

102
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:23,778
and you ruin it.

103
00:04:23,943 --> 00:04:24,944
Ruin it.

104
00:04:25,111 --> 00:04:27,352
- What? We are not party ruiners!
- Mm-mm.

105
00:04:27,647 --> 00:04:28,853
We're party creators!

106
00:04:29,148 --> 00:04:31,958
And besides, when have we ever
ruined a family event?

107
00:04:32,251 --> 00:04:33,406
Ah!

108
00:04:33,486 --> 00:04:34,624
We thought you might say that.

109
00:04:34,787 --> 00:04:35,841
Yep, here we go. And we just stream it.

110
00:04:35,921 --> 00:04:36,909
Apple TV.

111
00:04:36,989 --> 00:04:38,025
We just need your password.

112
00:04:38,258 --> 00:04:39,669
- Bryan's baby dick 69.
- Yeah.

113
00:04:39,826 --> 00:04:41,306
Bryan's baby dick 69.

114
00:04:41,629 --> 00:04:43,233
What the fuck, guys? Really?

115
00:04:43,398 --> 00:04:44,419
- Got it. Yep.
- Is that it?

116
00:04:44,499 --> 00:04:45,500
Good.

117
00:04:47,135 --> 00:04:49,081
Happy Fourth of July!

118
00:04:50,471 --> 00:04:51,506
Oh, shit!

119
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,989
It was fun up to that point.

120
00:05:05,953 --> 00:05:08,024
God damn it! My trailer!

121
00:05:16,197 --> 00:05:17,654
Oh, shit.

122
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,541
Actually, this is what
we're trying to avoid.

123
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:23,041
- The both of you are fucking idiots.
- Fucking losers!

124
00:05:32,215 --> 00:05:35,219
Grandpa, wake up! Take his tie.

125
00:05:35,385 --> 00:05:38,475
Are you saying we had something to do
with Grandfather's death? Hmm?

126
00:05:38,555 --> 00:05:40,626
He died five years after that!

127
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,701
That is a lot of guilt to put us.
Shame on you.

128
00:05:42,859 --> 00:05:45,237
Plus, this video only shows the screw-ups.

129
00:05:45,495 --> 00:05:47,668
Where's the epic tracking
shots of smiling faces?

130
00:05:48,365 --> 00:05:49,969
And everybody looking at us, just going...

131
00:05:50,133 --> 00:05:52,170
"God, I love Mike and Dave.

132
00:05:52,335 --> 00:05:54,440
"They made this whole party worth it."

133
00:05:54,704 --> 00:05:57,185
When are the two of you going to grow up?

134
00:05:57,408 --> 00:05:59,514
This shtick was cute for a while...

135
00:05:59,678 --> 00:06:01,089
but it's gotten stale.

136
00:06:01,246 --> 00:06:03,157
Mom, come on, what are you...

137
00:06:03,882 --> 00:06:06,522
You're talking about us like
we're a couple of losers or something.

138
00:06:06,685 --> 00:06:09,757
What we don't want you to do is
go chasing girls and get out of control.

139
00:06:09,921 --> 00:06:12,664
- You understand?
- Wait, we can still talk to girls, right?

140
00:06:12,824 --> 00:06:15,734
- You can each talk to one girl.
- The girls that you bring to the wedding.

141
00:06:16,428 --> 00:06:19,407
- What do you mean?
- I want you to bring a date.

142
00:06:19,564 --> 00:06:24,056
- That's two dates.
- You want us to bring dates to a wedding?

143
00:06:24,136 --> 00:06:26,341
- Excuse me?
- Are you allowed to do that?

144
00:06:26,505 --> 00:06:29,177
Nice, respectable, smart girls!
Keep you in line.

145
00:06:29,341 --> 00:06:30,547
- What the fuck?
- What?

146
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:32,052
- Are you insane?
- Oh, you're kidding.

147
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:34,451
You are not screwing up this wedding.
Do you hear me?

148
00:06:34,613 --> 00:06:37,356
Mom, do you hear this river of horse shit
coming out of Dad's mouth?

149
00:06:37,517 --> 00:06:40,556
We don't want you showing up stag
and riling each other up!

150
00:06:40,721 --> 00:06:43,133
- We don't rile each other up!
- We never get riled up!

151
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,429
- I don't get riled!
- He doesn't and I don't, either!

152
00:06:45,726 --> 00:06:47,296
Look at you right now! You're riled!

153
00:06:47,394 --> 00:06:49,601
- Take your head out of your ass, Dad!
- You sound insane right now.

154
00:06:49,696 --> 00:06:52,267
Everybody stop yelling! Okay?

155
00:06:52,433 --> 00:06:54,640
You guys bringing wedding dates
was my idea.

156
00:06:56,203 --> 00:06:58,774
Look, I love the shit out of you guys.

157
00:06:59,072 --> 00:07:01,951
But everyone is already stressed out
about this wedding...

158
00:07:02,242 --> 00:07:04,984
and I just need you to be cool.

159
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:06,880
Of course, Jeanie!

160
00:07:07,114 --> 00:07:08,388
Please?

161
00:07:08,549 --> 00:07:09,584
For me?

162
00:07:09,817 --> 00:07:12,161
I promise. We would never do anything
to mess up your wedding.

163
00:07:12,786 --> 00:07:13,992
Jeanie, we love you.

164
00:07:14,556 --> 00:07:15,810
We want this to be
the best day of your life.

165
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:16,879
Yeah.

166
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:18,047
You, too, Eric.

167
00:07:18,127 --> 00:07:19,333
- Oh.
- Oh. Thank you.

168
00:07:19,628 --> 00:07:20,729
Mostly you, though, Jeanie.

169
00:07:21,764 --> 00:07:23,719
If you want us to bring dates,
we're bringing dates.

170
00:07:23,799 --> 00:07:24,869
All right, it's settled then.

171
00:07:26,335 --> 00:07:27,712
Wedding dates!

172
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,607
Dave, buddy, let me talk to you
for a second, okay? Listen.

173
00:07:30,773 --> 00:07:32,844
I'm sorry to lump you in with Mike...

174
00:07:33,008 --> 00:07:34,681
but if I only told your older brother
to bring a date...

175
00:07:34,844 --> 00:07:36,448
he'd get all weird about it.

176
00:07:36,679 --> 00:07:38,750
I just feel like he's holding you back.

177
00:07:38,914 --> 00:07:40,450
Dad, I don't mind
being lumped in with Mike.

178
00:07:40,683 --> 00:07:42,026
Do you remember
the fifth grade bake sale...

179
00:07:42,184 --> 00:07:43,219
when Mom made those cupcakes...

180
00:07:43,486 --> 00:07:44,658
and I called them moist?

181
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,130
- Mm-hmm.
- Everyone called me Moist...

182
00:07:47,289 --> 00:07:49,200
till Mike took a cupcake...

183
00:07:49,358 --> 00:07:51,998
and shoved it in Tom Ginty's face.

184
00:07:52,161 --> 00:07:55,473
He said, "Now you're moist, Moist."

185
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,706
That's the kind of guy Mike is.

186
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,506
So, think on that...

187
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,645
Dad.

188
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:07,047
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to end that
on such a weird note, Dad.

189
00:08:07,144 --> 00:08:09,215
- I love you. And thanks.
- Good. I don't want you to be mad.

190
00:08:09,313 --> 00:08:10,435
I'm not even mad. I'm not even upset.

191
00:08:10,515 --> 00:08:11,550
We're gonna find some dates.

192
00:08:12,683 --> 00:08:15,254
I gotta say, some nights,
I am not looking my best.

193
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,466
But tonight is not one of those nights!

194
00:08:18,656 --> 00:08:19,862
- Do you like my hair?
- Yeah, girl.

195
00:08:20,024 --> 00:08:21,526
- You look good.
- No.

196
00:08:21,692 --> 00:08:22,864
We're gonna make a lot of tips tonight.

197
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:25,038
Good. We need it. We don't have any money.

198
00:08:25,363 --> 00:08:27,001
Uh, you got money for this ride, don't you?

199
00:08:27,498 --> 00:08:29,020
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

200
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,988
- 'Cause you have money?
- I thought you had money.

201
00:08:31,068 --> 00:08:33,125
- I don't have any money.
- You know I don't have money.

202
00:08:33,205 --> 00:08:35,743
Yeah, y'all are whispering like people
that don't got money.

203
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:37,354
Check it out. I'mma pay you right now.

204
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:39,165
Boop. I Apple Paid.

205
00:08:39,245 --> 00:08:40,383
I don't even have Apple Pay.

206
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,421
Yo, Siri, pay this man.

207
00:08:42,715 --> 00:08:43,703
He's already paid.

208
00:08:43,783 --> 00:08:44,771
God damn it!

209
00:08:44,851 --> 00:08:47,263
I'm not gonna take shit from you,
because this my cab.

210
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,842
You shouldn't take shit from us.

211
00:08:48,922 --> 00:08:51,144
- You should kick us out!
- You should kick us out of this cab.

212
00:08:51,224 --> 00:08:54,314
You know what? I'm gonna kick you
the fuck out of this cab.

213
00:08:54,394 --> 00:08:56,616
Yeah, just go three more blocks up
on the right...

214
00:08:56,696 --> 00:08:57,731
and then kick us out!

215
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:01,234
Here we are! Get out of my cab.

216
00:09:01,401 --> 00:09:02,709
Thank you. You're a really good person.

217
00:09:02,869 --> 00:09:03,904
Okay, God bless you.

218
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:06,550
I'm just gonna start driving for Uber.
Fuck it.

219
00:09:07,006 --> 00:09:08,007
Ooh. I got a good idea.

220
00:09:08,174 --> 00:09:09,847
Let's pop off, get a couple of drinks
before work.

221
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:12,081
Just a few,
because I don't want to get hammered.

222
00:09:12,246 --> 00:09:13,748
Yeah, of course not. Just a light buzz.

223
00:09:20,355 --> 00:09:23,426
Hey, hey, hey! Welcome to Sake Bombers...

224
00:09:23,592 --> 00:09:25,799
where your first Sake Bomb is on us!

225
00:09:25,961 --> 00:09:27,872
- Kaboom!
- You're drunk, Alice.

226
00:09:28,096 --> 00:09:29,718
You're doing that thing
where you're whispering,

227
00:09:29,798 --> 00:09:30,936
but you're really yelling.

228
00:09:31,099 --> 00:09:32,407
Because I'm upset with you.

229
00:09:32,567 --> 00:09:33,602
Oh, what the hell?

230
00:09:33,768 --> 00:09:36,091
I don't understand why you just
started yelling at me for no reason.

231
00:09:36,171 --> 00:09:38,978
- What the hell is going on here?
- Your little buddy is shit-faced.

232
00:09:40,141 --> 00:09:43,920
Straight up.
Her fiancé just left her at the altar.

233
00:09:44,212 --> 00:09:45,200
She's been going through a hard time.

234
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,369
- Are you guys talking about me?
- No, baby girl.

235
00:09:47,449 --> 00:09:48,928
You know how many times
I have come in here...

236
00:09:49,084 --> 00:09:53,033
and she is drunk off her fucking ass,
dancing on the tables?

237
00:09:53,155 --> 00:09:56,330
Only when Rihanna comes on,
because it's my jam.

238
00:09:56,493 --> 00:09:58,234
I am a strong independent woman.

239
00:09:58,495 --> 00:10:02,068
And I will get on a table
and shake my shit to RiRi.

240
00:10:02,232 --> 00:10:04,221
Because it's my right. America!

241
00:10:04,301 --> 00:10:05,302
Feminism!

242
00:10:05,469 --> 00:10:06,914
You just push your tits up
and say feminism?

243
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,447
Yeah. Read a Twitter.

244
00:10:08,872 --> 00:10:11,815
# 2016. Women can do shit now.

245
00:10:14,511 --> 00:10:15,956
Don't do that!

246
00:10:16,113 --> 00:10:17,615
Who put her jam on?

247
00:10:17,914 --> 00:10:19,951
Queen RiRi, forever!

248
00:10:20,117 --> 00:10:22,028
I'm really sorry that I got us fired.

249
00:10:22,285 --> 00:10:24,492
I'm just sort of surprised
it didn't happen sooner...

250
00:10:24,655 --> 00:10:26,100
- but I'm still really sorry.
- Hey!

251
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:29,503
Alice, you do not apologize
right now, okay?

252
00:10:29,593 --> 00:10:30,698
You didn't do one thing wrong.

253
00:10:30,928 --> 00:10:33,170
- Okay.
- People need to get in line with you.

254
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:35,369
Right. You're right.

255
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:37,275
Alice, why are you watching
your wedding video?

256
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:39,925
And Alice... do you take Luke?

257
00:10:40,005 --> 00:10:41,026
I do.

258
00:10:41,106 --> 00:10:43,982
Because it's therapeutic.
The more I watch it, the less I feel.

259
00:10:44,109 --> 00:10:45,179
And do you, Luke, take Alice?

260
00:10:45,377 --> 00:10:46,378
I do...

261
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:47,813
not.

262
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:51,555
Oh, man. Fuck you, Luke.

263
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:53,358
Oh, fuck that guy.

264
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:54,859
Fuck him right in his dick.

265
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,055
No!

266
00:10:56,221 --> 00:10:59,998
Because now I'm picturing his dick
getting fucked by another dick.

267
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,570
And it makes me want to protect it.

268
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:05,375
Oh, my God, girl! Damn!

269
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:07,204
You're better than this. Come on!

270
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:08,845
We're T and A!

271
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,505
Where's the Alice who made
vodka pot brownies with me...

272
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:13,049
for the junior high science fair?

273
00:11:13,207 --> 00:11:16,346
Or gave us water balloon tits and we won
that wet T-shirt contest in Mexico?

274
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,649
Oh, yeah, they were so nice.

275
00:11:18,813 --> 00:11:20,486
I know, dude. We need that shit.

276
00:11:20,748 --> 00:11:22,318
I'm tired of living like this.

277
00:11:23,317 --> 00:11:24,887
We need an adventure.

278
00:11:27,021 --> 00:11:29,399
We've got a great little package
we're selling here, man.

279
00:11:29,557 --> 00:11:31,833
A week in a tropical paradise...

280
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:34,939
with two fun-loving,
yet surprisingly well-read bros?

281
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:36,050
Yeah.

282
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,885
I read most of the Goosebumps series,
and so did you.

283
00:11:37,965 --> 00:11:38,953
Yeah.

284
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:40,021
Where do I sign up?

285
00:11:40,101 --> 00:11:41,288
Dude, focus.

286
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,109
- Okay.
- This is for Jeanie.

287
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,874
So to find the perfect fun, but nice girls,
we're gonna have to meet a lot of them.

288
00:11:47,308 --> 00:11:48,309
The Internet!

289
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:49,544
That's a good idea.

290
00:11:49,778 --> 00:11:51,258
Match.com, Tinder...

291
00:11:51,414 --> 00:11:52,969
Grindr, OkCupid.

292
00:11:53,049 --> 00:11:54,050
Craigslist!

293
00:11:54,217 --> 00:11:55,271
Craigslist?

294
00:11:55,351 --> 00:11:57,456
Craigslist, you think,
that's where you go to meet nice girls?

295
00:11:57,553 --> 00:11:58,725
Dave?

296
00:11:58,888 --> 00:12:00,561
We met this couch on Craigslist.

297
00:12:01,424 --> 00:12:03,665
And you wuv this couch, don't you?

298
00:12:04,727 --> 00:12:06,866
I do love that couch.

299
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:09,300
I'm gonna unlock the swag on this bitch.

300
00:12:09,632 --> 00:12:10,620
All right.

301
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,340
Here you go. Just take a little sip.
Take a little nip-a-roo.

302
00:12:16,806 --> 00:12:17,807
Boom!

303
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:19,996
Do you think anyone's even really gonna
see this?

304
00:12:20,076 --> 00:12:21,077
God, I hope so.

305
00:12:21,377 --> 00:12:22,549
Like max, what do you think?

306
00:12:22,712 --> 00:12:25,386
We're gonna get, like, five or six dates
out of this, or what?

307
00:12:25,548 --> 00:12:27,152
I'd be happy with that.

308
00:12:33,158 --> 00:12:34,179
Hey.

309
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:36,705
Did you see this thing
that Shelly's sending around the office?

310
00:12:36,928 --> 00:12:38,999
It's a free trip to Hawaii!

311
00:12:39,164 --> 00:12:40,719
Look what someone posted to my Facebook.

312
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:43,109
- I gotta tweet this out.
- Those guys are cute.

313
00:12:43,268 --> 00:12:44,303
Ala-hat!

314
00:12:44,469 --> 00:12:47,508
- I got the one on the right.
- I like the one on the right.

315
00:12:47,672 --> 00:12:48,660
Oh, I got the one on the right.

316
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,981
I like the one on the right.

317
00:12:51,109 --> 00:12:53,198
- We gotta send this to everyone.
- Let's all apply!

318
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:55,400
- I want to go to Hawaii.
- I just emailed them.

319
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,668
Let's just meet them, give 'em a chance.

320
00:12:56,748 --> 00:12:58,853
So, you guys want to go to a wedding?

321
00:13:00,485 --> 00:13:01,520
Uh, what are your names?

322
00:13:03,188 --> 00:13:04,189
Do you guys have names?

323
00:13:05,824 --> 00:13:08,704
Basically we were looking through
Craigslist for work.

324
00:13:09,362 --> 00:13:10,517
Oh, you're both...

325
00:13:10,597 --> 00:13:11,598
Prostitutes.

326
00:13:11,865 --> 00:13:13,386
Whatever. Take us to Hawaii!

327
00:13:13,466 --> 00:13:14,467
Hawaii!

328
00:13:17,604 --> 00:13:18,892
We can't take you.

329
00:13:18,972 --> 00:13:19,960
No way.

330
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,316
Did you guys say something about
an all-expenses-paid trip to Hawaii?

331
00:13:22,542 --> 00:13:23,680
It's just for girls.

332
00:13:24,044 --> 00:13:25,819
That's not a deal breaker.

333
00:13:26,046 --> 00:13:27,150
Hi, my name is Lauralie...

334
00:13:27,314 --> 00:13:28,602
and I'm kind of new to this.

335
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:29,669
Yeah.

336
00:13:29,749 --> 00:13:30,887
You're new to...

337
00:13:31,184 --> 00:13:32,663
Online dating. Yeah.

338
00:13:32,819 --> 00:13:35,197
I'm not really looking
for a heteronormative relationship.

339
00:13:35,322 --> 00:13:37,893
- You look like a Nike swoosh.
- Goddamn right, I do.

340
00:13:38,058 --> 00:13:39,059
I work at a dog shelter.

341
00:13:39,326 --> 00:13:40,703
Our sister loves dogs.

342
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:42,015
I wanna make sure
they get really good homes.

343
00:13:42,095 --> 00:13:43,096
What's a good home?

344
00:13:43,663 --> 00:13:44,903
The white homes.

345
00:13:45,065 --> 00:13:47,012
- The what homes?
- The white homes.

346
00:13:47,168 --> 00:13:48,375
Like white people.

347
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:52,375
Check, please.

348
00:13:52,674 --> 00:13:55,745
This isn't lipstick.
This is a tattoo, you dumb fuck.

349
00:13:56,745 --> 00:13:59,589
Who are you laughing at? Who?

350
00:13:59,848 --> 00:14:01,020
All right, look, here's the deal.

351
00:14:01,316 --> 00:14:03,523
I went through a divorce, like,
three weeks ago. I need a vacation.

352
00:14:03,819 --> 00:14:05,174
No.

353
00:14:05,254 --> 00:14:06,255
Okay, you guys sure
you don't want to fuck?

354
00:14:06,355 --> 00:14:07,356
- What?
- Nothing.

355
00:14:07,489 --> 00:14:08,510
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

356
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:10,879
Sounded like you said,
"Do you wanna fuck?"

357
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:11,960
Do you wanna fuck?

358
00:14:12,094 --> 00:14:13,115
- What?
- What?

359
00:14:13,195 --> 00:14:14,503
- What?
- You guys...

360
00:14:14,663 --> 00:14:15,767
- Do you want me to fuck you?
- No.

361
00:14:15,931 --> 00:14:17,410
- No.
- I didn't say it, but...

362
00:14:17,499 --> 00:14:19,638
- I'll suck your dick right now. What?
- What?

363
00:14:26,242 --> 00:14:29,584
Welcome back.
I'm here with Mike and Dave Stangle...

364
00:14:29,747 --> 00:14:31,420
who posted an ad on Craigslist...

365
00:14:31,582 --> 00:14:33,323
looking for dates
for their sister's wedding...

366
00:14:33,584 --> 00:14:35,621
in Oahu, Hawaii.

367
00:14:35,786 --> 00:14:36,890
Well, the ad went viral.

368
00:14:37,054 --> 00:14:38,089
Mm-hmm.

369
00:14:38,255 --> 00:14:40,633
It racked up over 6,000 responses...

370
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:43,013
from women who actually wanted to go.

371
00:14:43,093 --> 00:14:44,094
Yeah, well, who's counting?

372
00:14:44,261 --> 00:14:45,706
You know, I guess we all are.

373
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:46,965
Is this my close-up?

374
00:14:47,131 --> 00:14:48,633
You guys, come on. Craigslist?

375
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:51,211
Honestly, this is about
finding nice girls...

376
00:14:51,368 --> 00:14:53,712
to go with us to Hawaii
for our sister's wedding.

377
00:14:53,871 --> 00:14:55,043
And I just want to reiterate...

378
00:14:55,205 --> 00:14:57,685
we're footing the bill for this
because we're gentlemen.

379
00:14:57,942 --> 00:15:00,631
- Free trip to Hawaii?
- I'm awake!

380
00:15:00,711 --> 00:15:01,985
- Come on. Craigslist.
- What's up?

381
00:15:02,146 --> 00:15:03,557
That's where you go
to buy old patio furniture.

382
00:15:03,714 --> 00:15:04,955
You know what else you can find
on Craigslist?

383
00:15:05,116 --> 00:15:06,151
Mm-hmm.

384
00:15:06,585 --> 00:15:07,928
- Love.
- Mm-mm.

385
00:15:08,087 --> 00:15:10,260
That's right. I said it.

386
00:15:10,423 --> 00:15:12,096
- Love.
- That one seems sweet.

387
00:15:12,325 --> 00:15:14,396
He has a kind soul.

388
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,562
Yeah, and he's also super hot.

389
00:15:18,431 --> 00:15:20,274
Yeah, he's hot as fucking balls.

390
00:15:20,433 --> 00:15:22,845
But just to repeat,
we're looking for nice girls.

391
00:15:23,002 --> 00:15:26,279
Like, girls that our mom and our sister
would like.

392
00:15:26,439 --> 00:15:29,784
Okay, look, dude, we are going to Hawaii.

393
00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:31,386
Let's go on vacation.

394
00:15:31,677 --> 00:15:33,452
But it's not a vacation. It's a wedding.

395
00:15:33,746 --> 00:15:36,022
Do you really think a wedding's
the best place for me?

396
00:15:36,182 --> 00:15:39,459
Since the last wedding I went to
was mine...

397
00:15:39,618 --> 00:15:41,107
and it didn't turn out very well.

398
00:15:41,187 --> 00:15:42,188
I hear you, but look...

399
00:15:42,421 --> 00:15:44,868
this shit is why this shit
is perfect, okay?

400
00:15:45,025 --> 00:15:47,199
Because ever since Luke left,
you haven't been the same.

401
00:15:47,495 --> 00:15:49,941
You need to get over that,
once and for all.

402
00:15:50,098 --> 00:15:51,202
And this our shot, man.

403
00:15:51,499 --> 00:15:53,479
That dude,
he's gonna get your groove back.

404
00:15:53,701 --> 00:15:56,705
This right here is an opportunity
of a lifetime...

405
00:15:56,871 --> 00:15:59,044
and you know we are entrepreneurs.

406
00:15:59,207 --> 00:16:00,208
You know what?

407
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:02,616
Let's make these guys take us to Hawaii!

408
00:16:02,777 --> 00:16:04,450
You're right! Let's do it!

409
00:16:04,612 --> 00:16:05,600
Let's just do it!

410
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,715
- Yes, bitch.
- Let's fucking do it!

411
00:16:07,715 --> 00:16:09,003
We'll be right back.

412
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:12,297
We gonna go to Hawaii!
We gonna go to Hawaii!

413
00:16:14,022 --> 00:16:15,023
Whoa! Whoa!

414
00:16:15,156 --> 00:16:16,328
- Hold up!
- What?

415
00:16:17,725 --> 00:16:21,002
Those boys said they wanted nice girls.
We don't look like nice girls.

416
00:16:21,996 --> 00:16:23,908
Yeah, I guess
I haven't showered in a while.

417
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:26,043
Fine, well, you know what we're gonna do?

418
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:30,010
We're gonna look respectable as fuck.

419
00:16:30,306 --> 00:16:31,512
Like nice girls.

420
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:34,884
Ugh.

421
00:16:35,045 --> 00:16:37,116
Dude, it's like that Jesus rag!

422
00:16:38,181 --> 00:16:39,751
Ow! It's part of me.

423
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,530
Tatiana, your underwear
needs more underwears.

424
00:16:43,987 --> 00:16:44,988
Whoa!

425
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:49,370
Oh, this dress is my bitch!

426
00:16:52,028 --> 00:16:54,030
Dude, we have met 37 insane women.

427
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:56,573
We can't bring any of these girls.

428
00:16:56,733 --> 00:16:58,770
Maybe Dad'll just forget about
his ultimatum.

429
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:01,882
Why would Dad forget about an old tomato?

430
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,079
No, his ultimatum.

431
00:17:04,242 --> 00:17:05,414
- Old tom...
- Ultimatum.

432
00:17:05,577 --> 00:17:06,612
Are you saying "old tomato"?

433
00:17:06,878 --> 00:17:09,501
Ultima-tomb. Like a tomb or a crypt.

434
00:17:09,581 --> 00:17:10,616
Ultimatum.

435
00:17:10,749 --> 00:17:13,992
Well, we gotta figure something out,
because the wedding's coming up quick.

436
00:17:24,096 --> 00:17:25,632
Why is everything a competition with you?

437
00:17:25,864 --> 00:17:28,140
And I said that first, so actually,
I won that.

438
00:17:30,936 --> 00:17:32,142
So what time are we meeting them?

439
00:17:32,304 --> 00:17:34,079
Technically, no time.

440
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,611
Yeah, because I was thinking about
emailing them...

441
00:17:37,776 --> 00:17:39,380
but then I was thinking, um...

442
00:17:39,544 --> 00:17:42,424
what kind of floozy-ass bimbo
would respond to that ad?

443
00:17:42,782 --> 00:17:43,818
Um...

444
00:17:43,917 --> 00:17:44,918
Us.

445
00:17:45,085 --> 00:17:47,565
Yeah, but we're not like those idiots.
You know what I'm saying?

446
00:17:47,721 --> 00:17:50,531
Because they're all like,
"Oh! Pick me, pick me!"

447
00:17:50,824 --> 00:17:52,826
it's like the guys interviewing the girls.

448
00:17:52,993 --> 00:17:55,496
Like, it immediately would put us
in an inferior position.

449
00:17:55,662 --> 00:17:57,664
We're gonna flip the script
and Bachelorette that shit.

450
00:17:57,931 --> 00:18:00,104
- Those guys would be lucky to have us.
- Right.

451
00:18:00,267 --> 00:18:02,338
- We just gotta make them think so.
- Okay, right.

452
00:18:02,436 --> 00:18:04,609
But, you know,
I'm really not good at lying...

453
00:18:04,705 --> 00:18:07,027
because I always try to start small
and then it gets crazy...

454
00:18:07,107 --> 00:18:09,815
and I make-up stuff
that couldn't possibly be true.

455
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:12,733
Baby, you can do this.
Let's practice, okay?

456
00:18:12,813 --> 00:18:13,801
Okay.

457
00:18:13,881 --> 00:18:14,951
- Um, what do you like to do?
- Drink.

458
00:18:16,016 --> 00:18:17,256
Just sweet teas.

459
00:18:17,518 --> 00:18:19,498
Sweet teas and biscuits on blimps.

460
00:18:19,653 --> 00:18:21,793
All right, straight up,
you don't have to do an accent.

461
00:18:21,956 --> 00:18:22,992
I was doing an accent?

462
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:24,229
And definitely don't bring up blimps.

463
00:18:24,493 --> 00:18:25,801
Shit! They're leaving.

464
00:18:26,028 --> 00:18:27,268
If it was a competition, I won it.

465
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:29,601
All right, don't worry.

466
00:18:29,765 --> 00:18:30,766
It's all part of the plan.

467
00:18:30,933 --> 00:18:32,037
- Is it?
- Oh, yeah.

468
00:18:32,201 --> 00:18:34,681
What does that mean? What plan?
I don't know this part of the plan...

469
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:35,771
Whoa! Ahh!

470
00:18:36,272 --> 00:18:38,073
Oh, fuck!

471
00:18:39,108 --> 00:18:40,963
Tatiana! Oh!

472
00:18:41,043 --> 00:18:42,044
Holy shit.

473
00:18:42,278 --> 00:18:43,279
Babe. Are you okay?

474
00:18:43,512 --> 00:18:45,355
I'm okay. Yell, "She can't breathe!"

475
00:18:45,514 --> 00:18:46,618
She can't breathe!

476
00:18:46,782 --> 00:18:48,170
She can't breathe! Somebody help her!

477
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,251
Somebody give her CPR!

478
00:18:49,518 --> 00:18:51,054
- She can't breathe!
- I know CPR!

479
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,665
- Great!
- I was a volunteer EMT!

480
00:18:52,888 --> 00:18:54,196
Hey, don't worry.
My brother's got this, okay?

481
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:55,926
I took a class. I know what I'm doing.

482
00:18:56,192 --> 00:18:57,193
- She has a weak heart!
- Ma'am?

483
00:18:57,459 --> 00:18:58,631
- Ma'am?
- She has a weak heart.

484
00:18:58,794 --> 00:19:00,934
I'm an EMT. I'm like a doctor, basically.

485
00:19:01,198 --> 00:19:03,839
I'm here to save your fucking life, okay?

486
00:19:04,001 --> 00:19:06,242
- She's my only friend!
- That's her only friend, Mike!

487
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:07,592
We got a pulse! Okay.

488
00:19:07,672 --> 00:19:08,893
Don't let her die!

489
00:19:08,973 --> 00:19:10,714
Don't you fucking let her die, Mike!

490
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,912
Just shut the fuck up, Dave!
You, too, shut up!

491
00:19:13,211 --> 00:19:14,815
Both of you, shut up! Okay?

492
00:19:14,912 --> 00:19:15,913
I'm gonna save her life!

493
00:19:19,016 --> 00:19:20,617
Plug the nose.

494
00:19:23,754 --> 00:19:24,755
Oh!

495
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,302
Are you okay?

496
00:19:27,925 --> 00:19:29,765
I am now.

497
00:19:31,028 --> 00:19:32,530
- I saved her life!
- She's okay!

498
00:19:32,697 --> 00:19:34,176
- She's okay?
- I saved her life!

499
00:19:34,499 --> 00:19:36,901
Thank you! Thank you!

500
00:19:37,068 --> 00:19:39,413
- You're under arrest.
- She hit my car!

501
00:19:39,571 --> 00:19:40,827
No, you guys, I'm totally fine, really.

502
00:19:40,907 --> 00:19:42,045
It happens all the time.

503
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:44,620
That was a vicious hit.
We should take you to the hospital.

504
00:19:44,777 --> 00:19:46,620
It's crazy.
It's almost like I owe you my life.

505
00:19:47,547 --> 00:19:49,356
- Almost.
- Yeah. Technically, yeah.

506
00:19:49,515 --> 00:19:51,586
- Let me help you with that ice.
- I do.

507
00:19:51,784 --> 00:19:52,805
Oh, no.

508
00:19:52,885 --> 00:19:54,592
Seems like it's going pretty well
with your guy.

509
00:19:54,754 --> 00:19:58,010
Dude, I'm fucking crushing it! So hard!

510
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:02,035
Check this out. The kids in my class
are gonna love this story.

511
00:20:02,195 --> 00:20:03,799
I'm a school teacher.

512
00:20:05,698 --> 00:20:08,042
You're a school teacher? Wow.

513
00:20:08,201 --> 00:20:10,943
Oop. I think they spelt "frittata"
wrong on the menu.

514
00:20:11,104 --> 00:20:12,811
I always notice words and spelling...

515
00:20:12,972 --> 00:20:14,645
because I'm a teacher...

516
00:20:15,408 --> 00:20:16,648
and that's what I do.

517
00:20:17,576 --> 00:20:20,949
- That's...
- So, Alice, um, what do you do?

518
00:20:21,783 --> 00:20:22,921
Manage a hedge fund.

519
00:20:23,251 --> 00:20:24,389
You manage a hedge fund?

520
00:20:24,552 --> 00:20:26,657
I don't even know what a hedge fund is.

521
00:20:26,821 --> 00:20:29,324
Oh. So there's a regular fund,
and then there's a hedge fund.

522
00:20:29,491 --> 00:20:31,562
And our fund...

523
00:20:32,394 --> 00:20:33,464
Uh, we hedge it.

524
00:20:33,962 --> 00:20:34,963
We hedge it hard.

525
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:36,131
Oh, wow.

526
00:20:36,831 --> 00:20:38,435
I get in, in the morning, and I'm like...

527
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,410
"How's the hedging coming?
You been hedging? You hedged much?"

528
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:43,877
And it's like, too big to fail.

529
00:20:44,139 --> 00:20:46,016
Corporate greed, bailouts.

530
00:20:46,174 --> 00:20:48,279
In a New York minute,
everything can change.

531
00:20:48,576 --> 00:20:51,455
On the floor of the NASDAQ and the U.N.

532
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,818
And then, Fannie Mae.

533
00:20:53,481 --> 00:20:55,825
Bernie Mac and D.L. Hughley...

534
00:20:55,984 --> 00:20:57,157
- Alice, you want some water?
- Yeah.

535
00:20:57,453 --> 00:20:59,229
- That's so smart.
- That is.

536
00:20:59,523 --> 00:21:01,245
"But what I do have...

537
00:21:01,325 --> 00:21:03,513
"is a particular set of skills.

538
00:21:03,593 --> 00:21:06,164
"Skills I have acquired
over a very long career.

539
00:21:06,463 --> 00:21:09,307
"Skills that make me a nightmare
for people like you."

540
00:21:11,101 --> 00:21:12,171
Click. That's it.

541
00:21:12,436 --> 00:21:13,523
That was amazing.

542
00:21:13,603 --> 00:21:15,048
It was like Dave was not even here...

543
00:21:15,205 --> 00:21:17,116
and I was just standing in a bar
with Liam Neeson.

544
00:21:17,274 --> 00:21:18,719
Like, "Hello, Liam Neeson's over here."

545
00:21:19,009 --> 00:21:21,387
You're a professional comedian
or something?

546
00:21:21,545 --> 00:21:24,355
What? No. I sell liquor with my brother.

547
00:21:24,514 --> 00:21:25,515
- Oh.
- Yeah.

548
00:21:25,782 --> 00:21:27,489
- I do like to draw.
- Oh, yeah?

549
00:21:27,651 --> 00:21:29,130
Yeah, I have drawings here
I could show you.

550
00:21:29,953 --> 00:21:31,057
Oh, shit, not that. Sorry.

551
00:21:31,221 --> 00:21:33,360
Here. So, they're like The Avengers...

552
00:21:33,523 --> 00:21:35,230
but they're different types of alcohol.

553
00:21:35,525 --> 00:21:38,565
So, you have Tequila,
and then he's got his pet worm right there.

554
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:40,639
And his name is Lil' Mez.

555
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,411
Because he'll "Mez" you up.

556
00:21:42,568 --> 00:21:44,256
The next one right there, that's Gin.

557
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:46,492
When he flips his cap off,
dawg, he's just like...

558
00:21:46,572 --> 00:21:49,519
"Yo, I'll pop you off. Guaranteed.
One knock."

559
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:52,488
Done. Next, Whiskey.

560
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:55,350
Likes to make moonshine and kill bad guys.

561
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:57,369
Dude, this is objectively amazing.

562
00:21:57,449 --> 00:21:58,587
Thanks.

563
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:01,027
What's the hardest thing
about being a teacher?

564
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:02,688
I don't know.

565
00:22:04,857 --> 00:22:05,892
Oh, um...

566
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,947
The hardest thing about being a teacher...

567
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:10,131
is teaching cursive.

568
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:11,703
That's awesome.

569
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:13,605
- What about you?
- Yeah?

570
00:22:13,766 --> 00:22:15,542
- Are you seeing anyone?
- No.

571
00:22:16,236 --> 00:22:18,025
My ex is gone. Long gone.

572
00:22:18,105 --> 00:22:19,106
What do you mean?

573
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,117
He died. Of cancer.

574
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:22,410
Oh, my God.

575
00:22:22,576 --> 00:22:23,577
And AIDS.

576
00:22:24,044 --> 00:22:25,045
He died twice?

577
00:22:25,379 --> 00:22:27,723
And then he died in a plane crash, so...

578
00:22:28,282 --> 00:22:30,193
Whoo! That's a lot to take in.

579
00:22:30,351 --> 00:22:32,297
I know!

580
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,855
Thank you.

581
00:22:34,021 --> 00:22:35,523
Thank you, brotha.

582
00:22:37,558 --> 00:22:38,866
Dude.

583
00:22:39,026 --> 00:22:41,802
We should take these girls
to the wedding. Right?

584
00:22:41,962 --> 00:22:43,703
Mine's a sexy school teacher...

585
00:22:43,864 --> 00:22:46,208
and yours... hedges funds.

586
00:22:46,367 --> 00:22:47,744
- Just keep doing sexy eyes.
- Okay.

587
00:22:47,902 --> 00:22:49,313
Keep doing sexy eyes.

588
00:22:50,104 --> 00:22:51,378
I like Alice.

589
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:53,917
And she's smart, she's funny, she's weird.

590
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:57,089
We invite these girls to the wedding,
suddenly we're not losers.

591
00:22:57,246 --> 00:22:58,748
We're winners!

592
00:23:01,217 --> 00:23:02,252
Here they come. They're coming.

593
00:23:02,485 --> 00:23:04,226
Hey, uh, this might sound crazy...

594
00:23:04,387 --> 00:23:06,958
but our little sister is getting married
in Hawaii...

595
00:23:07,256 --> 00:23:11,227
and we wanted to know
if you guys wanted to come with.

596
00:23:11,427 --> 00:23:12,963
- Um...
- Um...

597
00:23:13,062 --> 00:23:15,167
Can you just give us a second to...

598
00:23:15,731 --> 00:23:16,971
Of course.

599
00:23:17,133 --> 00:23:20,080
Okay, so just whisper
like we're talking it over...

600
00:23:20,236 --> 00:23:21,324
like we're not sure if we wanna go or not.

601
00:23:21,404 --> 00:23:22,405
Oh, like...

602
00:23:28,177 --> 00:23:29,247
What the fuck are you doing?

603
00:23:29,412 --> 00:23:30,933
I don't understand why we're arguing!

604
00:23:31,013 --> 00:23:32,185
I thought we wanted to go.

605
00:23:32,348 --> 00:23:34,589
All right, fuck it. Let's go to Hawaii!

606
00:23:34,785 --> 00:23:37,129
- Yes! Fuck yes!
- Hawaii!

607
00:23:39,824 --> 00:23:40,979
Yo, what you know about goin' out?

608
00:23:41,059 --> 00:23:43,281
Head west, red Lex
TV's all up in the headrest

609
00:23:43,361 --> 00:23:45,617
Try and live it up, ride true, a bigger truck

610
00:23:45,697 --> 00:23:48,200
Peeps all glittered up
Stick up can, they go what?

611
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:50,155
Jig wit it 'cuz ship crisp, split it all

612
00:23:50,235 --> 00:23:52,408
Ho's ride, get your nut 'til I can't get it up

613
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:55,710
Bad, bad, bad, bad boy

614
00:23:55,807 --> 00:23:57,128
You make me feel so good

615
00:23:57,208 --> 00:23:58,209
Aloha, and welcome.

616
00:23:58,376 --> 00:23:59,377
- Hi.
- Aloha.

617
00:23:59,477 --> 00:24:00,598
For real?

618
00:24:00,678 --> 00:24:02,214
Let me get you gentlemen checked in, yeah?

619
00:24:03,548 --> 00:24:06,392
Holy shit, this place is nice!

620
00:24:07,552 --> 00:24:09,657
It's gonna be more nice.

621
00:24:09,821 --> 00:24:12,062
Nice girls don't show off their ecstasy.

622
00:24:12,223 --> 00:24:13,532
One of these is a multivitamin.

623
00:24:13,692 --> 00:24:14,694
Is this shit free?

624
00:24:14,861 --> 00:24:17,569
I can smoke weed out of this,
I can smoke weed out of this...

625
00:24:17,764 --> 00:24:20,904
Look at that teacher,
grabbing her apple a day.

626
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:24,178
Look at that personality from behind.

627
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:26,283
It is, dare I say...

628
00:24:26,439 --> 00:24:27,918
- well-rounded.
- Mmm-hmm.

629
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,009
Look at Mike.

630
00:24:29,175 --> 00:24:31,348
He looks like a funhouse mirror version
of a better looking dude...

631
00:24:32,379 --> 00:24:33,653
but he is just that dude.

632
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:36,985
Dave, it is so on this weekend.

633
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,428
I am not touching this guy
the whole weekend.

634
00:24:39,586 --> 00:24:41,875
He thinks just because he brought me here
I'm gonna sleep with him?

635
00:24:41,955 --> 00:24:42,956
Check it out.

636
00:24:43,056 --> 00:24:45,212
If this was Mike's dick, I'd be like...

637
00:24:45,292 --> 00:24:47,101
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo...

638
00:24:47,193 --> 00:24:48,695
I'd get close, but I'd never touch it.

639
00:24:49,429 --> 00:24:51,705
They have such beautiful flowers here.

640
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:54,256
She's throwing out
serious vibes right now.

641
00:24:54,336 --> 00:24:55,491
I'm like, I'm hungry.

642
00:24:55,571 --> 00:24:56,777
I'm gonna butter them biscuits.

643
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,712
I'm gonna baste them ham hocks.

644
00:24:58,874 --> 00:25:00,285
I'm gonna be like a sex chef.

645
00:25:00,542 --> 00:25:02,385
Mr. Grey will see you now.

646
00:25:02,744 --> 00:25:03,916
I'm gonna touch Dave.

647
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:05,456
Every time he says something sweet...

648
00:25:05,614 --> 00:25:08,652
I wanna get some rope and chain
in bulk from Home Depot...

649
00:25:08,817 --> 00:25:10,728
and just see where it takes us, you know?

650
00:25:10,886 --> 00:25:12,661
That is messed up.

651
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:15,064
Ladies, your wedding itineraries.

652
00:25:15,223 --> 00:25:16,678
# DoingItForJeanie.

653
00:25:16,758 --> 00:25:18,635
Today, we have the meet
and greet by the pool.

654
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,749
And then after that,
we have a dolphin excursion.

655
00:25:20,829 --> 00:25:22,317
Friday is the rehearsal dinner.

656
00:25:22,397 --> 00:25:23,485
Mmm-hmm.

657
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:26,087
That's where Dave and I are gonna be
doing our big speech.

658
00:25:26,167 --> 00:25:27,804
Will there be any downtime?

659
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:29,643
Yeah, 'cause I gotta keep
in touch with the office.

660
00:25:29,805 --> 00:25:31,995
I gotta call my stocks
about the state of my bonds.

661
00:25:32,075 --> 00:25:33,077
It happens a lot.

662
00:25:33,344 --> 00:25:35,790
Mm-kay, I think we are right up here.

663
00:25:36,513 --> 00:25:39,289
Great. So which one
is me and Alice's room?

664
00:25:40,784 --> 00:25:41,906
Uh...

665
00:25:41,986 --> 00:25:45,331
I don't know.
Are you and Alice gonna share a room?

666
00:25:45,489 --> 00:25:47,778
Or I was thinking that maybe you and I...

667
00:25:47,858 --> 00:25:49,599
would stay in the same room.

668
00:25:51,495 --> 00:25:54,601
That sounds interesting...

669
00:25:54,765 --> 00:25:56,767
but I don't think it would be a good idea.

670
00:25:58,102 --> 00:25:59,103
Why not?

671
00:26:01,672 --> 00:26:04,175
Because I don't trust myself around you.

672
00:26:04,842 --> 00:26:06,116
You can trust me.

673
00:26:06,276 --> 00:26:08,517
I do trust you.

674
00:26:09,313 --> 00:26:10,622
Let's trust each other.

675
00:26:10,782 --> 00:26:13,855
There's so much trust.

676
00:26:14,086 --> 00:26:16,396
Sorry. I didn't mean to do that.

677
00:26:16,489 --> 00:26:18,644
I respect you so much,
I can't wait to get you alone.

678
00:26:18,724 --> 00:26:20,980
Yeah, we're gonna cover
all the room charges and stuff...

679
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,548
for up to $50 per day.

680
00:26:22,628 --> 00:26:23,732
Oh, my God. You don't have to do that.

681
00:26:23,896 --> 00:26:26,001
I'm a very strict teacher.

682
00:26:26,198 --> 00:26:29,975
You be Michelle Pfeiffer
from Dangerous Minds, and I'll be...

683
00:26:30,136 --> 00:26:31,410
I'll be Coolio.

684
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:33,516
- Coolio's not in that movie.
- Oh.

685
00:26:34,907 --> 00:26:37,717
He is in song and spirit.

686
00:26:37,943 --> 00:26:40,617
I'm gonna call
a parent-teacher conference...

687
00:26:40,713 --> 00:26:43,489
and tell them what a bad boy you are.

688
00:26:43,649 --> 00:26:44,923
Please don't tell my mommy.

689
00:26:45,184 --> 00:26:46,505
Please don't tell my daddy.

690
00:26:46,585 --> 00:26:48,574
I think Wi-Fi is included, too, so...

691
00:26:48,654 --> 00:26:49,861
- That's always nice. Yeah.
- Yeah.

692
00:26:50,123 --> 00:26:54,115
If I were to give you a grade,
I'd give you a D.

693
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:55,401
A big, hard D.

694
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:56,938
Why? I deserve an A.

695
00:26:57,031 --> 00:26:58,533
- What are you talking about?
- Oh.

696
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,735
Nothing.

697
00:26:59,901 --> 00:27:01,244
In conclusion...

698
00:27:01,402 --> 00:27:03,780
I'm gonna stay in the room...

699
00:27:03,938 --> 00:27:05,008
with Alice.

700
00:27:06,107 --> 00:27:08,109
That one, with Alice.

701
00:27:08,276 --> 00:27:09,619
Cool, cool. No doubt.

702
00:27:12,113 --> 00:27:15,185
Somebody overcooked the soft pretzel.

703
00:27:16,417 --> 00:27:18,640
My dick is hard. That's what I'm saying.
Give me five minutes.

704
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,257
Oh, my God. Ew!

705
00:27:21,789 --> 00:27:23,462
Lift it, drop it, shake it

706
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:26,198
It's going down for real

707
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,610
It's going down for real

708
00:27:34,137 --> 00:27:35,548
Grandma, I'd like you to meet Alice.

709
00:27:35,705 --> 00:27:38,395
She's super smart, great conversationalist,
and she works on Wall Street.

710
00:27:38,475 --> 00:27:41,387
- But I'm one of the good ones.
- I think she is.

711
00:27:44,114 --> 00:27:45,320
I am a teacher, yeah.

712
00:27:45,548 --> 00:27:48,256
And you know what?
The key to teaching children is repetition.

713
00:27:48,418 --> 00:27:50,329
You'd be surprised how stupid they are.

714
00:28:00,163 --> 00:28:01,164
Jeanie!

715
00:28:03,733 --> 00:28:05,508
- Hey, you!
- Hi! Hi!

716
00:28:06,002 --> 00:28:08,506
I'm so proud
to introduce our wedding dates...

717
00:28:08,672 --> 00:28:10,311
- Tatiana.
- And Alice.

718
00:28:11,643 --> 00:28:12,849
Hi!

719
00:28:13,812 --> 00:28:15,917
- Oh, the bride. The gorgeous bride.
- Ow! Hi.

720
00:28:16,114 --> 00:28:19,789
This weekend is all about you
being happy and not shattered.

721
00:28:19,918 --> 00:28:22,074
- Oh. Thank you.
- Yeah.

722
00:28:22,154 --> 00:28:24,327
Check out your arms.
You got some Michelle Obama arms.

723
00:28:25,123 --> 00:28:27,032
How'd you get those guns
on the plane, girl?

724
00:28:28,193 --> 00:28:31,368
Eric... you are two points hotter
just being next to this woman.

725
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:33,085
Try 10 points hotter.

726
00:28:33,165 --> 00:28:35,253
- Try a million.
- That's too many points.

727
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:37,456
- Wow, and Jeanie, nice snag.
- Thank you.

728
00:28:37,536 --> 00:28:39,038
You guys look great together, really.

729
00:28:39,237 --> 00:28:42,614
I'm liking this. Huh? Maybe you two
will keep these two in check a little bit.

730
00:28:43,274 --> 00:28:46,017
I think we can.
I'll just keep him on a leash.

731
00:28:46,178 --> 00:28:47,934
Maybe don't hurt him.

732
00:28:48,014 --> 00:28:49,494
I like these girls.

733
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:50,720
They're so fun.

734
00:28:50,884 --> 00:28:52,989
Unlike my maid of honor.

735
00:28:53,187 --> 00:28:54,257
She's having a time.

736
00:28:54,388 --> 00:28:55,492
How is ol' Becky Grammerstein?

737
00:28:55,689 --> 00:28:56,690
She's coming.

738
00:28:56,824 --> 00:28:58,132
- Jeanie.
- Hey.

739
00:28:58,292 --> 00:28:59,669
I'm in crisis mode.

740
00:28:59,827 --> 00:29:01,465
I ordered Prosecco for the Mani-pedis...

741
00:29:01,628 --> 00:29:02,732
and all they have is champagne!

742
00:29:02,896 --> 00:29:03,897
Aren't they the same thing?

743
00:29:04,131 --> 00:29:06,543
- No. No, they're not. No.
- No?

744
00:29:07,167 --> 00:29:08,840
Hello, Michael.

745
00:29:09,002 --> 00:29:10,003
Hi, Dave.

746
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:13,974
Look, I'm trying to make your dreams
come true, okay?

747
00:29:14,174 --> 00:29:15,209
- Right.
- What?

748
00:29:15,342 --> 00:29:17,164
If this is bad news,
I'm gonna eat your ass.

749
00:29:17,244 --> 00:29:18,298
- Sorry.
- Okay.

750
00:29:18,378 --> 00:29:20,324
Purple. It better be purple.

751
00:29:20,747 --> 00:29:22,727
I should probably go see to that.

752
00:29:22,883 --> 00:29:23,884
- You'll come?
- Yeah.

753
00:29:24,051 --> 00:29:25,325
Thank you so much for being here.

754
00:29:25,485 --> 00:29:28,434
Guys, good job with these two.

755
00:29:28,591 --> 00:29:30,070
Mahala.

756
00:29:30,259 --> 00:29:31,499
Bye, Jeanie.

757
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,661
Jeanie likes the girls.

758
00:29:32,828 --> 00:29:34,034
Jeanie likes the girls

759
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,732
Talk about Jeanie Jeanie likes the girls

760
00:29:35,865 --> 00:29:37,653
Because it's a" about
Jeanie likes the girls

761
00:29:37,733 --> 00:29:39,838
- Oil, yeah, Jeanie likes the girls
- Come on!

762
00:29:39,935 --> 00:29:41,390
- It's a" about Jeanie
- Likes the girls

763
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:44,293
- it's all about Jeanie likes the girls!
- Mike. Where are the girls?

764
00:29:44,373 --> 00:29:45,579
- Oh, hello!
- I'm Alice.

765
00:29:45,808 --> 00:29:46,929
I just I wanna give you a hug.

766
00:29:47,009 --> 00:29:48,454
It's so nice to meet you.

767
00:29:48,611 --> 00:29:49,885
Fucking A. You distracted me, man.

768
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:52,081
This dress is lucky to be on you.
Those pins!

769
00:29:52,214 --> 00:29:53,284
- My Mike?
- Yes.

770
00:29:53,449 --> 00:29:54,621
- I can't... Wow.
- He did.

771
00:29:54,783 --> 00:29:56,456
That's fantastic.

772
00:29:56,685 --> 00:29:58,323
Mike, Tatiana was just telling me...

773
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,865
that you saved her life.

774
00:30:00,022 --> 00:30:01,296
I most certainly did, Father.

775
00:30:01,523 --> 00:30:04,246
You see how great it is
to have nice girls around?

776
00:30:04,326 --> 00:30:05,582
- I mean, these are nice girls.
- Aw!

777
00:30:05,662 --> 00:30:06,801
Absolutely.

778
00:30:06,931 --> 00:30:08,052
They are. And we brought them, so...

779
00:30:08,132 --> 00:30:09,406
Excuse me.

780
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,588
Excuse me.

781
00:30:10,668 --> 00:30:11,656
See you in a minute. Honey, come on.

782
00:30:11,736 --> 00:30:13,891
Can I get everybody's attention?
Could we gather around?

783
00:30:13,971 --> 00:30:15,348
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God!

784
00:30:15,473 --> 00:30:17,248
We're killing this shit! We're killing.

785
00:30:17,408 --> 00:30:18,563
Mom and Dad like the girls!

786
00:30:18,643 --> 00:30:19,730
Ow.

787
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:21,221
Mom and Dad like the girls

788
00:30:21,379 --> 00:30:25,885
Hi, I'm Keith.
I'm Eric's best man, his cousin...

789
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:28,052
and his best friend.

790
00:30:28,286 --> 00:30:30,731
Welcome to the meet and greet!

791
00:30:31,122 --> 00:30:32,430
Yeah!

792
00:30:32,657 --> 00:30:33,761
Put your hands together...

793
00:30:33,925 --> 00:30:37,048
for Eric and his lovely bride, Jeanie.

794
00:30:37,128 --> 00:30:38,801
Give it up!

795
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:40,102
Jeanie!

796
00:30:40,264 --> 00:30:43,734
Hey, everybody. A big thank you
to my new family, the Stangles.

797
00:30:43,935 --> 00:30:44,990
We love you, Eric!

798
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,092
Thank you.

799
00:30:46,172 --> 00:30:48,311
And to my own family, I must say...

800
00:30:49,309 --> 00:30:50,982
Portland, Oregon in the house!

801
00:30:52,445 --> 00:30:55,426
I'm really happy
to finally make you all my ohana...

802
00:30:55,581 --> 00:30:56,958
which means "family."

803
00:30:57,116 --> 00:30:59,153
And as the Hawaiians say...

804
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:00,525
Kale maluna!

805
00:31:00,687 --> 00:31:03,759
Which translates loosely
into "bottoms up."

806
00:31:03,923 --> 00:31:06,631
But more closely translated,
it actually means...

807
00:31:06,859 --> 00:31:09,249
"your butts to the sky"...

808
00:31:09,329 --> 00:31:10,933
which is inappropriate.

809
00:31:12,265 --> 00:31:13,801
This is gonna be magic.

810
00:31:14,434 --> 00:31:17,677
Thank you all again,
so much, for being here.

811
00:31:17,837 --> 00:31:21,512
We are so happy
to have you at our wedding.

812
00:31:22,041 --> 00:31:25,820
Wedding. Wedding. Wedding.

813
00:31:26,381 --> 00:31:28,019
- Put the mic on the stand.
- The stand.

814
00:31:29,351 --> 00:31:31,473
- Alice.
- Where are you going?

815
00:31:31,553 --> 00:31:32,540
Hi! What happened?

816
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,691
You sort of zoned out for a sec.
What's up? You okay?

817
00:31:34,856 --> 00:31:37,234
Yeah! We're at a wedding.
Wedding. Wedding.

818
00:31:37,625 --> 00:31:39,147
You just said "wedding" three times.

819
00:31:39,227 --> 00:31:40,315
I'm fine. Yeah!

820
00:31:40,395 --> 00:31:42,170
Let's just forget about the past,
and move on.

821
00:31:42,464 --> 00:31:44,068
To the bar!

822
00:31:44,165 --> 00:31:45,439
To the bar?

823
00:31:46,401 --> 00:31:47,402
Mmm. Mmm.

824
00:31:49,871 --> 00:31:51,316
Ooh. I don't think these are shots.

825
00:31:51,473 --> 00:31:53,043
I mean, we're drinking 'em
like they're shots...

826
00:31:53,141 --> 00:31:55,382
but I don't think they're
supposed to be drunk like that.

827
00:31:55,543 --> 00:31:57,489
Your face is funny.

828
00:32:14,331 --> 00:32:17,888
Oh. Hey, Mike. I was just talking
to my new friend, Tatiana.

829
00:32:17,968 --> 00:32:21,543
- Tatiana, this is my cousin, Mike.
- She knows who I am. She's my date.

830
00:32:21,738 --> 00:32:24,446
Why would someone this attractive
ever be with you?

831
00:32:24,741 --> 00:32:27,048
Are you gonna hit on my date all weekend,
like bisexual Fonzie?

832
00:32:27,177 --> 00:32:29,088
I don't think it's gonna take all weekend.
Am I right?

833
00:32:29,546 --> 00:32:30,786
So, you guys are cousins?

834
00:32:30,947 --> 00:32:32,688
She's been jealous of me
since I was a little kid.

835
00:32:32,883 --> 00:32:34,294
What could I possibly be jealous of?

836
00:32:34,418 --> 00:32:36,694
Your outfit looks like Jimmy Buffet's
dust ruffle.

837
00:32:36,953 --> 00:32:39,126
Do you guys always do this?

838
00:32:39,356 --> 00:32:41,063
Okay, this is actually
a very fashion-forward outfit.

839
00:32:41,224 --> 00:32:43,706
No, you look like the wallpaper
from a Long John Silver's bathroom.

840
00:32:43,896 --> 00:32:45,466
Cool. I'm gonna hit the buffet now...

841
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:49,272
while you guys do
whatever it is you're doing.

842
00:32:51,203 --> 00:32:52,358
Okay?

843
00:32:52,438 --> 00:32:53,439
Good idea.

844
00:32:54,773 --> 00:32:55,911
Look at that.

845
00:32:56,075 --> 00:32:58,097
Pink little ass just bouncing away,
saying...

846
00:32:58,177 --> 00:33:01,700
Terry, come get me, Terry, come get me

847
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,868
No, it's saying...

848
00:33:02,948 --> 00:33:06,953
Mike, crawl up in this
Mike, crawl up in this

849
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:08,894
Whoa. What's up, double trouble?

850
00:33:09,088 --> 00:33:10,309
Terry. Cousin of the bride.

851
00:33:10,389 --> 00:33:11,629
Get at me later,
we'll make a Terry sandwich.

852
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:13,269
Don't touch her. She has chlamydia.

853
00:33:13,425 --> 00:33:14,563
- Everybody does.
- No.

854
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:15,994
Not everyone does.

855
00:33:16,662 --> 00:33:19,084
Saw you and Dave are doing your
speech together at the rehearsal dinner.

856
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:20,152
Mmm-hmm.

857
00:33:20,232 --> 00:33:22,771
I'm going to bring the house down
with my speech.

858
00:33:23,037 --> 00:33:24,778
And why do you think
you're such a hotshot?

859
00:33:24,905 --> 00:33:26,077
You know Chris Rock?

860
00:33:26,841 --> 00:33:28,843
He's my neighbor.
Practiced my speech on him.

861
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:31,449
And he gave me seven killer jokes.

862
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:35,124
Suck on that, cousin.

863
00:33:35,749 --> 00:33:36,771
Terry out.

864
00:33:36,851 --> 00:33:39,661
Chris Rock? Fuck! That sounds awesome.

865
00:33:51,665 --> 00:33:54,669
Oh, my God. You were right.
These cheeseburgers are amazing.

866
00:33:54,835 --> 00:33:55,973
I know.

867
00:33:56,137 --> 00:33:57,980
Being a good girl is hard.

868
00:33:58,139 --> 00:34:00,051
I know. It sucks.

869
00:34:01,042 --> 00:34:04,024
You were hitting that booze
too hard for a nice girl.

870
00:34:04,213 --> 00:34:05,590
You need to get Luke out of your head.

871
00:34:05,715 --> 00:34:07,490
- Yeah.
- You do.

872
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:10,062
And what better way to do that...

873
00:34:10,319 --> 00:34:12,993
than good old-fashioned dick flicks.

874
00:34:13,156 --> 00:34:15,295
- Yes.
- Oh, God.

875
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:20,734
Tatiana. Mike Stangle.

876
00:34:20,897 --> 00:34:22,899
From the meet and greet.
Well, from before that.

877
00:34:23,065 --> 00:34:24,544
One second.

878
00:34:24,634 --> 00:34:25,635
Fuck.

879
00:34:26,869 --> 00:34:29,042
Hey. It's you.

880
00:34:29,205 --> 00:34:30,309
It is me.

881
00:34:30,473 --> 00:34:35,821
I was hoping maybe I could come in
and we could watch a movie or...

882
00:34:37,046 --> 00:34:40,286
- Do whatever you wanna do.
- Why are you whispering?

883
00:34:40,417 --> 00:34:42,557
'Cause that's what we were doing before.

884
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:43,755
They've got Cockbusters.

885
00:34:43,988 --> 00:34:45,899
Is that supposed to be like Ghostbusters?

886
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:47,936
Why would you wanna get rid of the cocks?

887
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,900
- What's that?
- She's talking in her sleep.

888
00:34:50,061 --> 00:34:52,905
She says the craziest stuff in her sleep.

889
00:34:52,997 --> 00:34:55,153
It looks like his dick is gonna pop.
It's so veiny and hard.

890
00:34:55,233 --> 00:34:56,234
- Tatiana!
- Something's hard?

891
00:34:56,401 --> 00:34:59,238
Julio. My student. I'm doing
a Skype class session with him...

892
00:34:59,404 --> 00:35:01,509
and he's having a really hard time
in the schoolyard.

893
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:03,128
If you don't get in here,
I'm gonna start masturbating!

894
00:35:03,208 --> 00:35:04,710
Oh, phooey. I've gotta go.

895
00:35:04,876 --> 00:35:06,431
That sounds like you guys are,
watching porno, or...

896
00:35:06,511 --> 00:35:07,499
- No.
- Tatiana!

897
00:35:07,579 --> 00:35:08,580
Does it smell like weed in here?

898
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,557
- You guys smoking weed?
- No. It was a skunk.

899
00:35:10,715 --> 00:35:13,218
I've gotta go, because a bunch of kids
are waiting to hear...

900
00:35:13,384 --> 00:35:15,091
if they've failed second grade or not.

901
00:35:15,253 --> 00:35:18,291
Well, I am doing
some grading myself, and girl...

902
00:35:18,457 --> 00:35:20,914
you are getting an A plus.

903
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:21,995
Thank you so much.

904
00:35:22,629 --> 00:35:23,630
Mmm.

905
00:35:55,495 --> 00:35:57,652
- And then win!
- Skills. Def skills.

906
00:35:57,732 --> 00:35:59,235
Cheers to Tatiana and Alice.

907
00:35:59,401 --> 00:36:01,139
We're so glad you're here.

908
00:36:01,903 --> 00:36:02,973
Yes. Cheers.

909
00:36:03,138 --> 00:36:05,243
You guys, Alice and I found
this really cool thing.

910
00:36:05,407 --> 00:36:07,114
Jurassic Park ATV Tours!

911
00:36:08,176 --> 00:36:10,349
You ride ATVs
where they shot Jurassic Park.

912
00:36:10,579 --> 00:36:14,755
Actually, we are about to go
swimming with the dolphins.

913
00:36:15,284 --> 00:36:17,093
It's on the itinerary, so...

914
00:36:17,319 --> 00:36:19,196
But, guys, Jurassic P!

915
00:36:19,288 --> 00:36:20,699
I love this movie!

916
00:36:20,856 --> 00:36:23,359
Oh, my gosh, on ATVs,
this would be so sick.

917
00:36:23,525 --> 00:36:24,765
"Welcome...

918
00:36:24,926 --> 00:36:27,668
"...to Jurassic Park."

919
00:36:27,763 --> 00:36:28,867
"That is a big pile of shit."

920
00:36:29,031 --> 00:36:31,539
"Oh, you're not so scary, little guy."

921
00:36:37,473 --> 00:36:38,782
What is going on here?

922
00:36:40,277 --> 00:36:41,465
Oh! Oh!

923
00:36:41,545 --> 00:36:44,685
I wish we could do that...

924
00:36:44,848 --> 00:36:46,691
but we have a date with the dolphins...

925
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:48,193
at the bottom of the ocean, so...

926
00:36:48,352 --> 00:36:50,798
Don't you think we should do
what Jeanie wants to do?

927
00:36:50,954 --> 00:36:52,490
I mean, it is her wedding after all.

928
00:36:52,656 --> 00:36:53,862
Right, Mike?

929
00:37:23,155 --> 00:37:25,101
I'm so happy we're here!

930
00:37:25,257 --> 00:37:27,703
This is where the dinos
ran in the prairie!

931
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:28,861
I know, girl!

932
00:37:29,028 --> 00:37:31,201
Check it out! I'm a brontosaurus!

933
00:37:31,364 --> 00:37:34,401
I'm a T-Rex. I'm coming to get you!

934
00:37:35,034 --> 00:37:37,412
Guys, butts on seats, okay?
No hot dogging!

935
00:37:43,109 --> 00:37:44,588
"They're flocking this way!"

936
00:37:45,978 --> 00:37:47,480
Here's a T-Rex!

937
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,555
"Life finds a way."

938
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,862
Jeanie! Eric!

939
00:38:00,962 --> 00:38:02,441
Hey!

940
00:38:02,563 --> 00:38:05,476
Hi! Sorry, I lost Eric.

941
00:38:05,633 --> 00:38:08,739
I wasn't lost.
Just driving at a reasonable pace.

942
00:38:09,003 --> 00:38:10,243
Stay there. We'll come to you.

943
00:38:10,738 --> 00:38:13,719
All right, we better go around.
This ledge looks super dangerous.

944
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:16,082
Oh, yeah, Mike's right.
It does look dangerous.

945
00:38:16,644 --> 00:38:19,250
It's a good thing my middle name
is "dangerous!"

946
00:38:19,414 --> 00:38:20,401
Yeah, it is!

947
00:38:20,481 --> 00:38:22,392
- Whoo!
- Whoa!

948
00:38:26,788 --> 00:38:28,267
- Oh, God!
- What?

949
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:32,530
Oh, my God, she's Superman!

950
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,572
Oh, my God!

951
00:38:38,668 --> 00:38:39,942
A-Money!

952
00:38:45,475 --> 00:38:46,920
I still think we should go around.

953
00:38:47,043 --> 00:38:49,319
She just got some serious air, bro!

954
00:38:49,412 --> 00:38:52,188
You call that serious air?
Check this fucking shit out.

955
00:38:52,282 --> 00:38:53,420
Whoa!

956
00:38:53,516 --> 00:38:55,372
Suck my clit, fuckers!

957
00:38:55,452 --> 00:38:56,453
Whoa!

958
00:38:59,255 --> 00:39:00,243
Whoa!

959
00:39:00,323 --> 00:39:01,358
Oh, not again.

960
00:39:02,358 --> 00:39:03,346
Yeah, baby!

961
00:39:03,426 --> 00:39:05,599
Easy does it. Nothing fancy.

962
00:39:11,468 --> 00:39:13,608
- Oh, my God. Look at what she's doing!
- I see it!

963
00:39:13,804 --> 00:39:15,907
Sweet candied nuts.

964
00:39:20,946 --> 00:39:22,482
Who are these girls?

965
00:39:24,549 --> 00:39:25,550
Whoa!

966
00:39:25,717 --> 00:39:27,390
Um...

967
00:39:27,486 --> 00:39:30,057
Where did you guys learn to do that?

968
00:39:30,222 --> 00:39:31,977
- We lived in Baja.
- Oh.

969
00:39:32,057 --> 00:39:33,730
Tore up a lot of trail down there.

970
00:39:33,992 --> 00:39:35,232
Made a lot of friends.

971
00:39:35,894 --> 00:39:37,396
Made even more enemies.

972
00:39:37,562 --> 00:39:38,734
God, I miss Baja.

973
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,741
Your turn, Mike! Don't be a pussy!

974
00:39:44,469 --> 00:39:47,678
I'm not gonna do it.
Name calling doesn't work on me, so...

975
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:50,581
Mike, it'll turn me on
if you take that jump.

976
00:39:50,742 --> 00:39:52,518
Turn me on if you don't.

977
00:39:52,678 --> 00:39:54,681
Still not going to, still.

978
00:39:54,848 --> 00:39:55,849
I'm not gonna do it.

979
00:39:56,016 --> 00:39:57,154
Like we would ever do that.

980
00:39:57,351 --> 00:39:59,072
No way.

981
00:39:59,152 --> 00:40:01,594
Come on! Do it.
He's not gonna do it. Do it!

982
00:40:01,755 --> 00:40:03,234
Do not do it.

983
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:05,028
No, definitely don't do that.

984
00:40:05,259 --> 00:40:07,136
It's a bad idea. It's a stupid, dumb idea.

985
00:40:07,227 --> 00:40:09,366
- And it's dangerous, and it's foolish.
- Yes, it is.

986
00:40:09,897 --> 00:40:11,103
I'm gonna do it!

987
00:40:12,766 --> 00:40:14,501
Mike!

988
00:40:15,836 --> 00:40:16,940
- Oh, shit!
- Oh.

989
00:40:17,437 --> 00:40:18,609
Oh!

990
00:40:18,739 --> 00:40:20,711
I'm never gonna die!

991
00:40:23,076 --> 00:40:24,798
- Oh, shit.
- He going fast.

992
00:40:24,878 --> 00:40:26,516
Oh, no. Keep it straight!

993
00:40:30,484 --> 00:40:31,519
Oh, he's shanking it.

994
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:36,100
Whoo! Got it, got it!

995
00:40:41,297 --> 00:40:42,605
Oh, no, God!

996
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:43,766
Jeanie, move!

997
00:40:46,769 --> 00:40:48,112
No!

998
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:49,305
No!

999
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:51,074
No!

1000
00:40:51,206 --> 00:40:52,480
No!

1001
00:41:13,931 --> 00:41:16,241
It's gonna be fine.

1002
00:41:16,701 --> 00:41:18,756
Your face is making me think
it's gonna be bad.

1003
00:41:18,836 --> 00:41:20,725
I'm sure it's not as bad as you think.

1004
00:41:20,805 --> 00:41:21,826
- You know?
- No. Yeah.

1005
00:41:21,906 --> 00:41:23,044
Just show us what we're working with,

1006
00:41:23,174 --> 00:41:24,195
and it'll be fine.

1007
00:41:24,275 --> 00:41:25,276
- Okay.
- Okay?

1008
00:41:25,843 --> 00:41:26,931
Is it okay?

1009
00:41:27,011 --> 00:41:28,547
- Oh, my God!
- Oh! God! Oh!

1010
00:41:28,879 --> 00:41:31,325
Wow! Don't you look good?

1011
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:34,993
- Your face!
- Shut up, Mike!

1012
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:36,928
You shut up, Becky!
Have you seen her face?

1013
00:41:37,088 --> 00:41:38,931
Oh, God! What?

1014
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:41,366
It looks like you were making meth,
and the bathtub exploded.

1015
00:41:42,593 --> 00:41:43,936
You look like Burn Victim Barbie.

1016
00:41:44,328 --> 00:41:45,636
Hush it up!

1017
00:41:45,796 --> 00:41:46,951
And you're Black Ken.

1018
00:41:47,031 --> 00:41:48,977
- Stop!
- Okay.

1019
00:41:49,133 --> 00:41:51,189
It's like an exaggerated smoky eye.

1020
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:53,272
Dave, be honest. Is it bad?

1021
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,213
This side, there's a little...

1022
00:41:56,309 --> 00:41:58,431
- There's a little discoloration there.
- Little discoloration.

1023
00:41:58,511 --> 00:41:59,649
Which side is it?

1024
00:41:59,879 --> 00:42:01,034
You could do a dance the whole night

1025
00:42:01,114 --> 00:42:02,650
where you just hold a hand over your face.

1026
00:42:02,782 --> 00:42:03,783
- Oh, that's smart.
- Okay.

1027
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:04,951
It's like a new thing.

1028
00:42:05,118 --> 00:42:08,824
- Do the Jeanie, do the Jeanie
- Like this?

1029
00:42:09,055 --> 00:42:10,864
- Come on, everybody! Do the Jeanie.
- Do it.

1030
00:42:11,057 --> 00:42:12,434
- I'm doing the Jeanie.
- Do the Jeanie, y'all.

1031
00:42:12,525 --> 00:42:13,560
It's a one-two step.

1032
00:42:13,693 --> 00:42:15,502
All right, that's enough.

1033
00:42:15,762 --> 00:42:17,366
Enough dancing! You and you...

1034
00:42:17,497 --> 00:42:18,874
outside, now!

1035
00:42:19,032 --> 00:42:20,938
Honey, calm down.

1036
00:42:22,035 --> 00:42:23,537
- Honey, calm down.
- Sorry.

1037
00:42:23,703 --> 00:42:26,047
Do you understand they've deformed
our little girl...

1038
00:42:26,205 --> 00:42:28,344
the day before her goddamn wedding?

1039
00:42:28,608 --> 00:42:30,732
She looks like Seal, for Christ's sake!

1040
00:42:30,812 --> 00:42:32,634
Oh! Why, Dad?

1041
00:42:32,714 --> 00:42:33,715
Ow!

1042
00:42:34,816 --> 00:42:36,159
Do you think he's gonna spank us?

1043
00:42:36,317 --> 00:42:37,318
What?

1044
00:42:38,086 --> 00:42:39,087
Never mind.

1045
00:42:39,187 --> 00:42:41,142
I haven't seen him this pissed
in a long time.

1046
00:42:41,222 --> 00:42:42,257
OOP-

1047
00:42:42,357 --> 00:42:44,166
Yeah. It's the other door.

1048
00:42:45,093 --> 00:42:46,181
They meet in the middle.

1049
00:42:46,261 --> 00:42:47,865
- They meet in the middle.
- God damn it!

1050
00:42:50,065 --> 00:42:52,443
Dad, listen. I know what you're gonna say.

1051
00:42:52,567 --> 00:42:54,823
- You're right.
- We're gonna sue the ATV companies.

1052
00:42:54,903 --> 00:42:56,109
- Right?
- I see.

1053
00:42:56,237 --> 00:42:57,238
Not what I was gonna say.

1054
00:42:57,372 --> 00:42:58,612
Let's Erin Brockovich this bitch.

1055
00:42:58,773 --> 00:43:00,343
Mike, stop!

1056
00:43:00,508 --> 00:43:02,731
You've got to own this.
This is your fault.

1057
00:43:02,811 --> 00:43:03,812
It's not.

1058
00:43:04,345 --> 00:43:06,382
If anything, it's the girls' fault.

1059
00:43:06,648 --> 00:43:07,956
They're crazy.

1060
00:43:08,116 --> 00:43:10,507
The girls aren't the problem!

1061
00:43:10,587 --> 00:43:11,964
You are.

1062
00:43:12,122 --> 00:43:14,261
What the hell did you think
was gonna happen, huh?

1063
00:43:14,424 --> 00:43:16,131
What did you think was gonna happen?

1064
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:17,294
We had a plan.

1065
00:43:17,461 --> 00:43:19,873
The plan was to swim with dolphins...

1066
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:21,737
and eat bananas afterwards.

1067
00:43:21,898 --> 00:43:23,639
See, Dad, I'm not gonna
point any fingers here...

1068
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:24,801
but indirectly...

1069
00:43:24,968 --> 00:43:27,642
we wouldn't have been on ATVs
if the girls hadn't forced us to.

1070
00:43:27,804 --> 00:43:30,250
And who made us bring dates
in the first place?

1071
00:43:31,408 --> 00:43:32,462
- Not pointing fingers.
- Yeah.

1072
00:43:32,542 --> 00:43:34,783
All right. I'm gonna take back
what I said to you earlier.

1073
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:37,084
I am going to lump you in together.

1074
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:40,057
All right, you are lumped!

1075
00:43:40,717 --> 00:43:42,628
The hell is wrong with you, huh?

1076
00:43:43,754 --> 00:43:45,131
What the hell is wrong with you?

1077
00:43:46,723 --> 00:43:48,101
Dad.

1078
00:43:50,729 --> 00:43:52,140
Fuck.

1079
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:56,737
Everyone get the fuck away from me.

1080
00:43:56,902 --> 00:43:59,314
Move! Adult Swim!

1081
00:43:59,471 --> 00:44:02,748
It's all fucked now.
It's all fucked, you know? Poor Jeanie.

1082
00:44:03,041 --> 00:44:04,897
Jeanie's special weekend, and I ruin it.

1083
00:44:04,977 --> 00:44:08,550
Hey, hey, hey, Alice?
That was not your fault, okay?

1084
00:44:08,814 --> 00:44:11,637
That's two weddings that I've ruined.
It's just like, "Stupid Alice!"

1085
00:44:11,717 --> 00:44:14,095
Look, it's too bad that
Jeanie's face got shredded...

1086
00:44:14,386 --> 00:44:15,974
but this is supposed to be our vacay.

1087
00:44:16,054 --> 00:44:17,843
Remember? We're supposed
to be having fun...

1088
00:44:17,923 --> 00:44:19,044
and going on adventures.

1089
00:44:19,124 --> 00:44:20,228
Get in here with me.

1090
00:44:20,392 --> 00:44:21,735
I'm gonna find her.
I'm gonna make it up to her.

1091
00:44:21,894 --> 00:44:24,397
No, no! You're not listening to me.
Don't leave me!

1092
00:44:33,974 --> 00:44:36,097
Thanks again for letting me
join your spa day, ladies.

1093
00:44:36,177 --> 00:44:39,920
It's not like you asked or anything,
but you're here. Yay.

1094
00:44:40,347 --> 00:44:42,452
What did you guys do
for your bachelorette party?

1095
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:44,605
Did it get crazy?
Did you guys do that thing...

1096
00:44:44,685 --> 00:44:47,495
where you go to Vegas
and you dress up as a prostitute...

1097
00:44:47,822 --> 00:44:49,510
and you go out and there's a contest...

1098
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:51,797
to see who can get the most money
from a john...

1099
00:44:52,059 --> 00:44:53,881
but then you tell him,
"I'm an undercover cop"...

1100
00:44:53,961 --> 00:44:56,999
and they, like, beg that you don't tell
their children and their wives...

1101
00:44:57,164 --> 00:44:59,804
and they piss themselves,
and you've got the whole thing on video.

1102
00:44:59,967 --> 00:45:03,039
And then you put it on YouTube
and then there's the Auto-Tune remix.

1103
00:45:03,204 --> 00:45:04,205
Did you do that thing?

1104
00:45:04,872 --> 00:45:05,943
- No.
- No.

1105
00:45:06,274 --> 00:45:10,781
I didn't actually end up having one, so...

1106
00:45:10,947 --> 00:45:12,585
Why? Every bride
needs a bachelorette party.

1107
00:45:12,782 --> 00:45:14,937
I'm sorry Cabo didn't work out, Jeanie.

1108
00:45:15,017 --> 00:45:16,506
I know. It's fine.

1109
00:45:16,586 --> 00:45:17,640
You know I couldn't get the time off work.

1110
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:20,109
And it would have ruined it for you,
down there without me.

1111
00:45:20,189 --> 00:45:21,344
Is there some tension about this?

1112
00:45:21,424 --> 00:45:24,046
So I just thought, "Let's cancel
the whole trip," if that makes sense.

1113
00:45:24,126 --> 00:45:26,082
Jeanie, can you keep it down?
On the phone with Tokyo.

1114
00:45:26,162 --> 00:45:27,250
Did I bring up something uncomfortable?

1115
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:29,674
Also, I caught the shingles
because it was so stressful.

1116
00:45:31,634 --> 00:45:32,688
'Cause it feels like I did.

1117
00:45:32,768 --> 00:45:35,304
Plus they have Mexican bed bugs.

1118
00:45:36,806 --> 00:45:39,150
I need you guys to stop it!

1119
00:45:40,209 --> 00:45:42,519
Oh, that fucking gaping mouth of yours,
shut it!

1120
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:44,080
Shut it!

1121
00:45:44,513 --> 00:45:48,258
I just want to relax!
Is that too much to ask?

1122
00:45:48,653 --> 00:45:51,259
Please! I just wanna relax.

1123
00:45:53,925 --> 00:45:55,199
How are you feeling, Jeanie?

1124
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,839
A little stressed out.

1125
00:45:56,995 --> 00:45:59,839
- I'll give you a minute to disrobe.
- Yeah, okay.

1126
00:45:59,998 --> 00:46:02,069
Face down on the table.

1127
00:46:02,467 --> 00:46:05,924
Hi, um, that is my best friend in there...

1128
00:46:06,004 --> 00:46:08,177
and she's getting married tomorrow,
and she's a little uptight.

1129
00:46:08,473 --> 00:46:13,616
And I was wondering if you could, um,
help her let loose a little bit?

1130
00:46:13,778 --> 00:46:14,799
You know?

1131
00:46:14,879 --> 00:46:19,885
Give her the "Hawaii Five Oh" experience?

1132
00:46:20,251 --> 00:46:22,874
The wink-wink, nudge-nudge massage,
you know?

1133
00:46:22,954 --> 00:46:26,460
I can't really wink,
but a wink-wink, nudge-nudge?

1134
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,481
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1135
00:46:28,561 --> 00:46:30,234
Looks like you had a bit of a fit.

1136
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:33,001
No, no. That's wink... That's wink-wink...

1137
00:46:34,267 --> 00:46:36,474
I feel like I've gotten
what you're trying to say.

1138
00:46:36,703 --> 00:46:38,925
- Great.
- But I figured it out.

1139
00:46:39,005 --> 00:46:41,595
- You didn't really communicate it to me.
- Okay, that's fair.

1140
00:46:41,675 --> 00:46:45,521
Yes, you want the special
"I am blissful" massage?

1141
00:46:45,645 --> 00:46:47,750
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1142
00:46:48,248 --> 00:46:49,283
Um...

1143
00:46:49,382 --> 00:46:51,293
- How blissful is that?
- Oh, don't worry.

1144
00:46:51,451 --> 00:46:52,987
Physically, no penetration.

1145
00:46:53,086 --> 00:46:54,074
Classy.

1146
00:46:54,154 --> 00:46:57,158
Spiritually, I'll be doing
an intimate tour of her chi.

1147
00:46:57,457 --> 00:46:59,494
Oh, you're gonna be good in there.
I can tell.

1148
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:01,764
How's the temperature in here, Jeanie?

1149
00:47:02,562 --> 00:47:04,441
Oh, it's good. Good. Comfy.

1150
00:47:04,599 --> 00:47:07,944
Good. Take down the light a little bit.

1151
00:47:08,103 --> 00:47:09,810
So you're getting married, huh?

1152
00:47:10,072 --> 00:47:11,608
I am. Yeah.

1153
00:47:11,807 --> 00:47:14,663
I know it can be a stressful time.

1154
00:47:14,743 --> 00:47:18,657
You know it's like, "Who is this for,
me or my family?"

1155
00:47:18,814 --> 00:47:21,260
Yeah. I've recently had
an injury to my face...

1156
00:47:21,416 --> 00:47:23,418
which I'm a little stressed out about.

1157
00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:25,120
Are you okay with oil?

1158
00:47:25,287 --> 00:47:26,595
Yeah, sure.

1159
00:47:29,591 --> 00:47:30,846
You know, in my country...

1160
00:47:30,926 --> 00:47:34,203
they call oil "God's beautiful lubricant."

1161
00:47:35,197 --> 00:47:37,370
It sounds better in my language.

1162
00:47:40,936 --> 00:47:42,525
Oh, that's lovely.

1163
00:47:42,605 --> 00:47:43,627
'kay.

1164
00:47:43,707 --> 00:47:45,095
Some ground rules.

1165
00:47:45,175 --> 00:47:47,765
One, no emotions.

1166
00:47:47,845 --> 00:47:49,950
- Okay.
- Two, breathe.

1167
00:47:51,515 --> 00:47:55,655
Three, there is no penetration,
only vibration.

1168
00:47:56,954 --> 00:47:59,332
What is happening?

1169
00:47:59,690 --> 00:48:01,931
I call this "The Bent Penguin."

1170
00:48:02,092 --> 00:48:04,572
This one is just "The Ham and Eggs."

1171
00:48:04,728 --> 00:48:07,641
This one is called "When Moons Collide."

1172
00:48:07,798 --> 00:48:10,301
"Angry Hummingbird." "Angry Hummingbird."

1173
00:48:10,467 --> 00:48:12,845
This one is called "House by the Airport."

1174
00:48:13,003 --> 00:48:15,244
Just checking in. Everything good?

1175
00:48:15,406 --> 00:48:18,080
Hope you're enjoying this.
For me, it's just another Friday.

1176
00:48:25,884 --> 00:48:27,727
"Happy Doll."

1177
00:48:28,087 --> 00:48:32,194
This one is just called
"Taking a Break." I am pooped.

1178
00:48:32,358 --> 00:48:35,100
A little break. That's nice.

1179
00:48:36,996 --> 00:48:38,134
Here we go again.

1180
00:48:40,032 --> 00:48:41,568
Are you even touching me?

1181
00:48:41,767 --> 00:48:44,247
No, but my aura is.

1182
00:48:44,537 --> 00:48:47,059
Yes, it is!

1183
00:48:47,139 --> 00:48:49,551
Sweet baby Jesus!

1184
00:49:08,663 --> 00:49:09,801
How's it going?

1185
00:49:10,331 --> 00:49:12,811
Shit, I thought I was alone in here.

1186
00:49:12,967 --> 00:49:15,914
Oh, yeah. You're not. I mean, we're alone.

1187
00:49:16,504 --> 00:49:18,848
How's Mike? Still really jealous of me?

1188
00:49:19,474 --> 00:49:23,251
It's like, yeah, okay,
do I own a Tesla? Yes.

1189
00:49:23,411 --> 00:49:26,051
Do I make a shit-ton of money,
like, way more than Mike?

1190
00:49:26,214 --> 00:49:27,522
Yes. But it's like, who cares?

1191
00:49:27,682 --> 00:49:29,753
Do I get backstage tickets to Rihanna?

1192
00:49:30,017 --> 00:49:32,573
Do I have a glass blowing
studio in my basement?

1193
00:49:32,653 --> 00:49:34,655
Hold up, backstage tickets to Rihanna?

1194
00:49:34,822 --> 00:49:36,733
Yeah, she likes to have me around.
You know.

1195
00:49:36,891 --> 00:49:39,815
- RiRi is Alice's jam.
- Oh, RiRi, is it?

1196
00:49:39,895 --> 00:49:40,930
- Yes.
- That's funny.

1197
00:49:41,097 --> 00:49:43,577
She would freak out if I got her
backstage tickets to Rihanna.

1198
00:49:43,733 --> 00:49:46,873
Well, you could get her tickets.
From me. I'm right here.

1199
00:49:47,036 --> 00:49:48,413
Are you serious?

1200
00:49:48,571 --> 00:49:51,882
Oh, God, steam rooms just open up
your pores, you know?

1201
00:49:52,542 --> 00:49:54,579
They open up everything.

1202
00:49:57,714 --> 00:50:01,938
Backstage at RiRi is very fun.
Sometimes she plays the DJ.

1203
00:50:02,018 --> 00:50:05,692
You know, just scratching records.
You know like...

1204
00:50:09,125 --> 00:50:10,798
Shit, man. That's...

1205
00:50:11,227 --> 00:50:14,284
Are you saying you want me
to get in there for the tickets?

1206
00:50:14,364 --> 00:50:17,106
No. No, no, no. No.

1207
00:50:17,934 --> 00:50:19,608
Yes.

1208
00:50:23,275 --> 00:50:24,618
Tatiana?

1209
00:50:25,544 --> 00:50:26,784
Tatiana? Whoa.

1210
00:50:27,612 --> 00:50:30,650
Sorry about that.
Looking for my wedding date.

1211
00:50:31,216 --> 00:50:32,217
Tatiana?

1212
00:50:32,317 --> 00:50:33,455
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

1213
00:50:37,622 --> 00:50:38,657
Please leave, sir.

1214
00:50:38,823 --> 00:50:40,063
What are you doing to my sister?

1215
00:50:40,225 --> 00:50:42,762
- Mike, I'm coming.
- No!

1216
00:50:53,271 --> 00:50:54,477
Get out!

1217
00:50:58,511 --> 00:51:01,925
Oh, sure. Oh, sure. Oh, sure.

1218
00:51:02,082 --> 00:51:03,925
So, are we, like, close, or...

1219
00:51:04,585 --> 00:51:07,556
Let's put the washing machine
on spin cycle. There we go.

1220
00:51:07,855 --> 00:51:09,763
What the... Tatiana!

1221
00:51:09,923 --> 00:51:11,129
Terry!

1222
00:51:11,291 --> 00:51:12,634
Terry!

1223
00:51:12,793 --> 00:51:15,034
- Tatiana!
- Shut the fuck up, Mike.

1224
00:51:17,598 --> 00:51:18,585
Whoa!

1225
00:51:18,665 --> 00:51:20,471
I'm gonna kick your ass.

1226
00:51:22,970 --> 00:51:24,381
He is losing this fight!

1227
00:51:26,707 --> 00:51:28,562
Oh, God! I can see your nipple!

1228
00:51:28,642 --> 00:51:29,643
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1229
00:51:32,713 --> 00:51:34,717
Get your butt out of my face!

1230
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:42,130
Well, thank you so much.

1231
00:51:42,658 --> 00:51:44,194
Um, I definitely needed this.

1232
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:47,170
I know.
Bring this gift into your marriage.

1233
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:51,405
- All you need is load-bearing ribbons.
- Okay.

1234
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:54,056
- And a reinforced ceiling.
- Oh.

1235
00:51:54,136 --> 00:51:55,410
I should warn you...

1236
00:51:55,537 --> 00:51:59,610
you may experience some
aftershock orgasms.

1237
00:51:59,842 --> 00:52:01,048
Oh.

1238
00:52:01,210 --> 00:52:04,384
So, I wouldn't operate any heavy machinery
for a couple weeks.

1239
00:52:04,546 --> 00:52:07,152
That is not a euphemism for penis.
I mean like...

1240
00:52:07,316 --> 00:52:11,765
- tractors, cranes, big boats.
- Okay.

1241
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,593
Good to know.

1242
00:52:13,756 --> 00:52:16,100
- Oh, and please hydrate.
- Okay.

1243
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:20,333
I cannot stress this enough.
The consequences could be...

1244
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:23,044
You could develop cancer.

1245
00:52:24,568 --> 00:52:25,876
You have a very good friend.

1246
00:52:31,242 --> 00:52:33,722
Wait, you did that?

1247
00:52:34,078 --> 00:52:36,968
Yeah, well, I felt so bad
about your fucked up face...

1248
00:52:37,048 --> 00:52:38,459
and I wanted to make it up to you.

1249
00:52:39,083 --> 00:52:40,426
Aw! Thank you.

1250
00:52:40,751 --> 00:52:43,595
Hey, who needs a bachelorette party
when they have you around?

1251
00:52:44,955 --> 00:52:46,844
- He rubbed my butt.
- Yeah?

1252
00:52:46,924 --> 00:52:48,699
But with his butt.

1253
00:52:48,859 --> 00:52:51,465
It was like... He was on ribbons.

1254
00:52:52,763 --> 00:52:54,352
I don't know what you did
with Jeanie in the spa...

1255
00:52:54,432 --> 00:52:56,021
but she's in a great mood.

1256
00:52:56,101 --> 00:52:58,605
Yeah, no problem.
She just needed a release.

1257
00:52:58,771 --> 00:53:01,115
Oh, um, I had an idea for your graphic novel.

1258
00:53:01,274 --> 00:53:03,529
I thought you could do
like a Rum character,

1259
00:53:03,609 --> 00:53:05,111
who's like Rastafarian, and he's like...

1260
00:53:05,511 --> 00:53:09,681
"I'm Rum Rum, get in my tum-tum,
and I play the steel drum."

1261
00:53:10,216 --> 00:53:11,752
"You can rum, but you cannot hide, man."

1262
00:53:11,918 --> 00:53:14,421
Yeah, that's awesome.
Already, that's so amazing.

1263
00:53:14,587 --> 00:53:16,897
No, that's such a good idea.
How did I not figure that?

1264
00:53:18,925 --> 00:53:22,964
I think when I get back,
I'm gonna stop selling liquor with Mike...

1265
00:53:23,129 --> 00:53:24,608
and start drawing full time.

1266
00:53:24,764 --> 00:53:26,243
- Really?
- Yeah.

1267
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:27,901
That's amazing.

1268
00:53:28,067 --> 00:53:30,274
Do you know how few people
know what they really wanna do?

1269
00:53:30,436 --> 00:53:32,592
But then I think about
what Mike's gonna think about it all...

1270
00:53:32,672 --> 00:53:34,652
and he's gonna hate that idea.

1271
00:53:34,808 --> 00:53:36,516
He's so clingy.

1272
00:53:36,678 --> 00:53:39,501
When we were kids,
if I fell asleep before Mike...

1273
00:53:39,581 --> 00:53:41,652
he would always wake me up
so he wouldn't feel alone.

1274
00:53:41,816 --> 00:53:43,659
- That's kinda sweet.
- Yeah.

1275
00:53:43,818 --> 00:53:45,456
I don't know. I just...

1276
00:53:49,257 --> 00:53:50,634
Do you ever get that feeling...

1277
00:53:50,792 --> 00:53:54,296
that you're not good enough
to get what you really want...

1278
00:53:54,462 --> 00:53:56,271
so you're too scared to try?

1279
00:53:57,999 --> 00:53:59,307
All the time.

1280
00:54:00,001 --> 00:54:02,777
- Really?
- Like, all the time. It's terrifying.

1281
00:54:02,937 --> 00:54:04,814
- It is, it's terrifying.
- Yeah.

1282
00:54:04,973 --> 00:54:05,974
You're, like, stuck.

1283
00:54:06,141 --> 00:54:07,779
- Totally.
- Yeah.

1284
00:54:07,942 --> 00:54:09,444
Thanks. It's nice talking to you
about this.

1285
00:54:22,826 --> 00:54:24,247
Hey. Where you going?

1286
00:54:24,327 --> 00:54:26,717
Is there a gang bang in the ballroom
you need to emcee?

1287
00:54:26,797 --> 00:54:28,276
Don't be such a drama king.

1288
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:30,072
Yeah, I'm totally overreacting.

1289
00:54:30,233 --> 00:54:31,541
When you invite someone to a wedding...

1290
00:54:31,701 --> 00:54:33,957
they obviously are supposed to
finger diddle your family members.

1291
00:54:34,037 --> 00:54:35,038
That's common courtesy!

1292
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:37,481
Okay, hold up. I am a grown-ass woman.

1293
00:54:37,674 --> 00:54:39,711
I can finger diddle whomever I want.

1294
00:54:39,843 --> 00:54:42,346
Just because you say "whomever"
does not make it okay.

1295
00:54:42,512 --> 00:54:45,982
It's not a big deal.
It's just like texting someone.

1296
00:54:46,216 --> 00:54:48,162
- Oh.
- It's just like Tinder.

1297
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:52,776
Swipe right, swipe right, swipe left.
Swipe left, swipe right.

1298
00:54:52,856 --> 00:54:54,646
That's very graphic. That is...

1299
00:54:54,726 --> 00:54:57,866
Rotating your photos.
Expanding them, contracting them.

1300
00:54:58,030 --> 00:55:00,567
Are you deliberately trying to hurt me?
Is that what you're doing?

1301
00:55:00,732 --> 00:55:03,255
What? No!
I was just trying to get RiRi tickets...

1302
00:55:03,335 --> 00:55:05,281
to make my best friend feel better, okay?

1303
00:55:05,437 --> 00:55:06,939
We're on vacay.

1304
00:55:09,007 --> 00:55:10,008
No...

1305
00:55:10,175 --> 00:55:13,884
You are invited to my sister's wedding.
You're supposed to smile, nod...

1306
00:55:14,046 --> 00:55:15,252
and do what I want you to do.

1307
00:55:15,414 --> 00:55:16,415
That's the deal.

1308
00:55:17,049 --> 00:55:18,858
I thought that we had a connection.

1309
00:55:19,418 --> 00:55:20,419
Like a spark.

1310
00:55:20,586 --> 00:55:23,533
You thought you were gonna bring me here
so that you could have sex with me.

1311
00:55:23,856 --> 00:55:26,311
Yes. No! What? Yeah, right.

1312
00:55:26,391 --> 00:55:27,392
Really?

1313
00:55:29,361 --> 00:55:31,068
Yes, obviously.

1314
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:33,269
You are so hot. And you smell good.

1315
00:55:33,434 --> 00:55:35,209
It's not a weird thing that I wanna have
sex with you...

1316
00:55:35,369 --> 00:55:37,315
because you are very sexy...

1317
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:39,576
and you were leading me on,
and we are in Hawaii...

1318
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:41,617
which is a sexy place,
and people have sex here.

1319
00:55:41,775 --> 00:55:44,085
God, dude,
you built this all up in your head.

1320
00:55:44,245 --> 00:55:46,122
Alice and I just saw you on TV...

1321
00:55:46,313 --> 00:55:48,088
- wanted to go to Hawaii.
- Hold up.

1322
00:55:49,116 --> 00:55:50,117
Fuck.

1323
00:55:50,284 --> 00:55:51,285
You saw us on TV?

1324
00:55:51,452 --> 00:55:53,854
No, I don't even watch Wendy Williams.

1325
00:55:58,726 --> 00:55:59,727
What?

1326
00:56:00,961 --> 00:56:02,497
- What?
- Shh!

1327
00:56:02,596 --> 00:56:03,904
I thought you dug me.

1328
00:56:04,064 --> 00:56:05,338
Are you even a teacher?

1329
00:56:08,335 --> 00:56:09,336
No.

1330
00:56:09,503 --> 00:56:10,504
What about little Julio...

1331
00:56:10,671 --> 00:56:12,812
the dyslexic boy
who you taught how to read?

1332
00:56:12,975 --> 00:56:15,353
Made it up. All of it.

1333
00:56:15,511 --> 00:56:17,787
Although I did have sex
with this guy name Julio once...

1334
00:56:17,947 --> 00:56:19,449
and I'm pretty sure he couldn't read.

1335
00:56:20,416 --> 00:56:22,919
Here I thought you were Michelle Pfeiffer
from Dangerous Minds.

1336
00:56:23,085 --> 00:56:25,258
Turns out, you're Michelle Pfeiffer
from Scarface.

1337
00:56:25,955 --> 00:56:27,366
And you didn't even

1338
00:56:27,523 --> 00:56:30,902
say hello to my little friend.

1339
00:56:35,464 --> 00:56:37,341
Oh, come on, man.

1340
00:56:38,367 --> 00:56:39,471
Mike.

1341
00:56:53,151 --> 00:56:54,960
I'm really sorry. Um...

1342
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:58,157
I've been acting crazy.

1343
00:56:58,489 --> 00:57:01,112
It's probably about Luke, my ex.

1344
00:57:01,192 --> 00:57:04,366
Oh, yeah. The guy who
died in the plane crash...

1345
00:57:05,029 --> 00:57:07,168
with cancer, and AIDS, and stuff.

1346
00:57:07,332 --> 00:57:09,039
Yeah, that's the one.

1347
00:57:09,701 --> 00:57:11,840
Except none of that stuff happened,
'cause, um...

1348
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:17,228
I lied.

1349
00:57:17,308 --> 00:57:18,309
You lied?

1350
00:57:20,445 --> 00:57:21,533
I can't do this.

1351
00:57:21,613 --> 00:57:22,614
Wait.

1352
00:57:22,714 --> 00:57:23,749
Sorry.

1353
00:57:23,848 --> 00:57:26,504
- That's okay. That's okay.
- Sorry everyone.

1354
00:57:26,584 --> 00:57:29,759
I just forgot my phone.
Can I grab my phone?

1355
00:57:30,489 --> 00:57:33,231
Sorry, I still don't want to get married.

1356
00:57:35,395 --> 00:57:39,575
Oh, my gosh. That's almost
as bad as the plane crash story.

1357
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:41,879
Why didn't you just tell me?

1358
00:57:43,870 --> 00:57:46,043
I didn't want you to think
I was damaged goods.

1359
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:49,015
I would never think that.

1360
00:57:49,843 --> 00:57:51,049
"Love hurts.

1361
00:57:52,045 --> 00:57:53,718
"Love scars.

1362
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:57,692
"Love wounds, and mars."

1363
00:57:58,718 --> 00:58:02,894
That's from a really old song,
for old people.

1364
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:05,965
Why are you so nice?

1365
00:58:08,963 --> 00:58:10,910
'Cause I think you're nice.

1366
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:19,141
David!

1367
00:58:20,042 --> 00:58:22,716
David, I need you here with me now.
Come on.

1368
00:58:22,878 --> 00:58:24,118
No. No.

1369
00:58:24,546 --> 00:58:26,924
Stangles, assemble. Now!

1370
00:58:27,082 --> 00:58:28,789
- Let's go.
- Is he okay?

1371
00:58:28,884 --> 00:58:29,871
Yeah, I think he's fine.

1372
00:58:29,951 --> 00:58:30,952
He's just got a lot on his mind.

1373
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:32,140
Let's go!

1374
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:34,490
Okay, I'm coming, dude. Jeez.

1375
00:58:36,625 --> 00:58:37,797
Oh... I...

1376
00:58:37,893 --> 00:58:39,804
You gave me a boost up. Okay.

1377
00:58:47,502 --> 00:58:48,983
A line has been drawn, David.

1378
00:58:49,239 --> 00:58:51,729
A clear line in the sand.

1379
00:58:51,809 --> 00:58:53,397
Is that why you brought me
all the way down here...

1380
00:58:53,477 --> 00:58:55,599
so you could literally
draw a line in the sand?

1381
00:58:55,679 --> 00:58:56,867
I'm a visual thinker, David.

1382
00:58:56,947 --> 00:58:58,255
- God damn it!
- Son of a...

1383
00:58:59,550 --> 00:59:02,339
These girls, they've gotta go.

1384
00:59:02,419 --> 00:59:06,595
They pretended to dig us
just to get a free trip to Hawaii.

1385
00:59:06,757 --> 00:59:08,031
They're liars!

1386
00:59:08,192 --> 00:59:10,263
So what, man? So they lied.

1387
00:59:10,694 --> 00:59:12,082
I was talking to Alice.

1388
00:59:12,162 --> 00:59:14,108
You have no idea
what this girl's been through.

1389
00:59:14,264 --> 00:59:16,767
She needed this trip.
We might have saved her life.

1390
00:59:17,134 --> 00:59:20,024
We should be practicing our speech
for tonight.

1391
00:59:20,104 --> 00:59:22,516
Not babysitting the twins
from The Shining.

1392
00:59:25,375 --> 00:59:26,854
Oh, my God.

1393
00:59:27,010 --> 00:59:28,355
Why are you laughing at me?

1394
00:59:28,681 --> 00:59:30,603
You sound like mom and dad
when they're talking about us.

1395
00:59:30,683 --> 00:59:32,629
Well, no, fuck that noise.

1396
00:59:33,185 --> 00:59:34,774
Oh. Oh. Oh.

1397
00:59:34,854 --> 00:59:36,390
Guess what! You're gonna love this.

1398
00:59:36,555 --> 00:59:40,469
Tatiana was jerking off our cousin Terry.

1399
00:59:40,626 --> 00:59:42,281
- What?
- Mmm-hmm.

1400
00:59:42,361 --> 00:59:43,499
Cousin Terry has a dick?

1401
00:59:43,829 --> 00:59:45,418
No, not "jerking off" jerking off.

1402
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:47,671
The female version of jerking.

1403
00:59:47,833 --> 00:59:49,506
Dude, let's just chill out...

1404
00:59:49,668 --> 00:59:51,807
focus on Jeanie,
and try not to be assholes...

1405
00:59:51,971 --> 00:59:53,292
for the rest of the weekend, okay?
Can we do that?

1406
00:59:53,372 --> 00:59:55,010
I can't do that, David.

1407
00:59:55,407 --> 00:59:57,478
Because I saw our little sister...

1408
00:59:58,310 --> 00:59:59,311
What?

1409
01:00:00,212 --> 01:00:02,590
Well, let's just say
she was making this face...

1410
01:00:04,984 --> 01:00:06,692
What? She saw a ghost?

1411
01:00:08,823 --> 01:00:10,234
She really had to pee?

1412
01:00:11,592 --> 01:00:12,593
Doing vocal warmups?

1413
01:00:13,461 --> 01:00:15,116
What are you doing?
It looks like you're having an orgasm.

1414
01:00:15,196 --> 01:00:18,541
She was, David! With the masseuse.

1415
01:00:19,066 --> 01:00:20,409
- What!
- Yes!

1416
01:00:20,601 --> 01:00:21,739
Oh, my God!

1417
01:00:21,869 --> 01:00:24,025
- She orgasms like a star.
- No!

1418
01:00:24,105 --> 01:00:25,277
What's next?

1419
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:30,011
I'm gonna walk in on mom
giving dad a Push Pop?

1420
01:00:30,678 --> 01:00:31,713
What's a Push Pop?

1421
01:00:31,846 --> 01:00:35,191
I made it up, Dave.
It's a sexual term that I just made up.

1422
01:00:35,349 --> 01:00:37,872
- What's a Push Pop?
- I don't know.

1423
01:00:37,952 --> 01:00:39,807
- What's a Push Pop?
- I don't know!

1424
01:00:39,887 --> 01:00:41,109
What's a Push Pop?

1425
01:00:41,189 --> 01:00:43,692
I've been to the bowels of the Internet,
and I've never seen a Push Pop.

1426
01:00:43,858 --> 01:00:45,428
God, just tell me! What's a Push Pop?

1427
01:00:45,594 --> 01:00:47,541
It's a whole hand up an ass, David.

1428
01:00:47,697 --> 01:00:49,608
Is that what you want me to say?

1429
01:00:49,766 --> 01:00:53,145
- Oh, God!
- Two hands pushin' the pop.

1430
01:00:53,236 --> 01:00:55,307
- Oh, God.
- Is that what you want me to say?

1431
01:00:55,405 --> 01:00:56,941
I'll send you some links.

1432
01:01:16,326 --> 01:01:18,431
- We're at table two.
- I'll be at the bar.

1433
01:01:18,595 --> 01:01:20,131
- I said table two.
- I'll be at the bar!

1434
01:01:20,296 --> 01:01:21,468
You're out of control!

1435
01:01:22,298 --> 01:01:23,299
Thank you.

1436
01:01:24,434 --> 01:01:26,006
Trouble in paradise?

1437
01:01:30,175 --> 01:01:33,054
Freaking I don't care if I cause a scene.

1438
01:01:33,211 --> 01:01:37,159
Freaking I will punch you 17,000 times
in the face. Freaking.

1439
01:01:37,315 --> 01:01:38,316
Take a shot.

1440
01:01:38,817 --> 01:01:41,388
You look like Don Johnson
fucked Zack Morris.

1441
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:44,999
Wait till Tatiana hears your shitty speech
after my crazy dope one.

1442
01:01:45,156 --> 01:01:46,533
She's never gonna
touch your baby bird again.

1443
01:01:48,227 --> 01:01:50,300
Thriller-Terry out!

1444
01:01:51,963 --> 01:01:53,465
So sad!

1445
01:01:53,632 --> 01:01:54,872
Oh, my God. It's a movie about cameras

1446
01:01:54,966 --> 01:01:56,240
just following you everywhere.

1447
01:01:56,468 --> 01:01:58,790
- Like The Truman Show.
- Yeah! Exactly like The Truman Show!

1448
01:01:58,870 --> 01:02:00,577
Hey, Dave! Dave!

1449
01:02:00,739 --> 01:02:01,979
Hey, what's up?

1450
01:02:02,140 --> 01:02:04,798
I need you to come backstage right now
and practice the speech.

1451
01:02:04,878 --> 01:02:06,084
Uh...

1452
01:02:06,179 --> 01:02:08,250
Dude, I'm kind of
talking to Alice right now.

1453
01:02:08,415 --> 01:02:10,156
Which is a conversation
you've now interrupted twice.

1454
01:02:10,317 --> 01:02:11,523
Our speech needs to kill.

1455
01:02:11,685 --> 01:02:13,722
Terry got a punch up from Chris Rock.

1456
01:02:13,987 --> 01:02:16,433
I didn't want to tell you before
because I didn't want you to freak out.

1457
01:02:16,590 --> 01:02:17,591
I'm not freaking out.

1458
01:02:17,724 --> 01:02:19,067
Calm the fuck down, Dave!

1459
01:02:19,226 --> 01:02:20,364
You calm the fuck down!

1460
01:02:20,527 --> 01:02:22,302
Mike, you look like
your face is gonna pop.

1461
01:02:22,529 --> 01:02:24,318
You gonna come or what?

1462
01:02:24,398 --> 01:02:25,786
Let's go.

1463
01:02:25,866 --> 01:02:27,739
I'll see you backstage.

1464
01:02:29,970 --> 01:02:30,991
Uh...

1465
01:02:31,071 --> 01:02:33,160
- I'm gonna go deal with this real quick.
- Okay.

1466
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:35,186
I'll just talk to myself for a while.
All alone.

1467
01:02:38,445 --> 01:02:40,220
...look on your stupid face!

1468
01:02:40,314 --> 01:02:41,802
What's wrong with me?

1469
01:02:41,882 --> 01:02:43,538
Don't fucking look at her. Turn around.

1470
01:02:43,618 --> 01:02:45,007
Everybody get the fuck out of here.

1471
01:02:45,087 --> 01:02:46,430
Fuck you, Luke.

1472
01:02:46,789 --> 01:02:49,560
I'm just gonna have
a little lie down, okay?

1473
01:03:01,337 --> 01:03:02,509
Hi!

1474
01:03:02,671 --> 01:03:04,093
- Hi!
- Hi!

1475
01:03:04,173 --> 01:03:06,295
Did you need to
take a little breather, too?

1476
01:03:06,375 --> 01:03:07,877
No. Why? Are you?

1477
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:10,065
Well...

1478
01:03:10,145 --> 01:03:13,502
You know, you think that
every moment is going to feel...

1479
01:03:13,582 --> 01:03:15,871
warm and glowy...

1480
01:03:15,951 --> 01:03:17,773
and absolutely magical.

1481
01:03:17,853 --> 01:03:20,800
But, then, some stuff happens.

1482
01:03:21,790 --> 01:03:23,364
- Sure does.
- Yeah.

1483
01:03:25,363 --> 01:03:28,572
Well, if you want
warm, glowy and magical...

1484
01:03:29,433 --> 01:03:30,503
I have just the thing.

1485
01:03:31,135 --> 01:03:32,307
I don't leave home without it.

1486
01:03:35,139 --> 01:03:36,694
- Ecstasy.
- Oh!

1487
01:03:36,774 --> 01:03:39,397
Every bride deserves to have a little fun
the night before her wedding!

1488
01:03:39,477 --> 01:03:41,457
Yeah. I deserve to have a little fun.

1489
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:44,421
You are so nice to me.

1490
01:03:44,648 --> 01:03:45,649
Aww.

1491
01:03:48,686 --> 01:03:50,342
This is gonna be so much fun!

1492
01:03:50,422 --> 01:03:53,357
- We should find something to suck on.
- What? Oh.

1493
01:03:53,724 --> 01:03:56,064
- Mike!
- Here. Put these on.

1494
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:57,732
- We need headsets?
- Yeah!

1495
01:03:58,095 --> 01:04:00,384
There's a lot of dancing
in our speech, my man. Right?

1496
01:04:00,464 --> 01:04:01,653
Gotta go hands free.

1497
01:04:01,733 --> 01:04:03,289
This is how we do it, baby.

1498
01:04:03,369 --> 01:04:05,391
Come on. Hey, check this out.

1499
01:04:05,471 --> 01:04:07,527
I'm going to "wedding crash" cousin Terry.

1500
01:04:07,607 --> 01:04:08,661
What?

1501
01:04:08,741 --> 01:04:09,762
Put a few eye drops in her drink.

1502
01:04:09,842 --> 01:04:11,597
That way she shits all night,
and can't do the speech.

1503
01:04:11,677 --> 01:04:12,849
Just like in the movie Wedding Crashers.

1504
01:04:13,046 --> 01:04:14,767
Mike, that is a terrible idea.

1505
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:17,103
- You've seen the movie!
- Of course I've seen the movie.

1506
01:04:17,183 --> 01:04:19,072
- You love that movie.
- Everyone loves that movie.

1507
01:04:19,152 --> 01:04:20,573
How's it a bad idea if you love the movie?

1508
01:04:20,653 --> 01:04:22,608
I love Taken.
I don't want to go steal little girls.

1509
01:04:22,688 --> 01:04:24,377
But we shouldn't wedding crash
our own cousin.

1510
01:04:24,457 --> 01:04:25,678
I'm worried about you, man.

1511
01:04:25,758 --> 01:04:27,635
I'm really worried
that you're losing your mind.

1512
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,364
The look in your eyes right now...

1513
01:04:29,595 --> 01:04:31,551
You haven't blinked
since we've started talking.

1514
01:04:31,631 --> 01:04:33,076
Oh, Davie, Davie, Davie!

1515
01:04:33,299 --> 01:04:34,369
What?

1516
01:04:34,767 --> 01:04:37,373
I've never been in more control
in my entire life.

1517
01:04:40,624 --> 01:04:42,353
Mike!

1518
01:04:42,653 --> 01:04:43,808
Mike!

1519
01:04:43,908 --> 01:04:45,022
This is really intense.

1520
01:04:45,647 --> 01:04:47,268
Yeah, it's hitting me really hard.

1521
01:04:47,348 --> 01:04:49,225
This is good ecstasy.

1522
01:04:49,684 --> 01:04:51,493
I don't know. I wouldn't know.
It's my first time.

1523
01:04:51,686 --> 01:04:53,074
- Wait, what?
- What?

1524
01:04:53,154 --> 01:04:55,477
Why would you take ecstasy
for the first time

1525
01:04:55,557 --> 01:04:56,978
on the night before your wedding?

1526
01:04:57,058 --> 01:04:58,059
What?

1527
01:04:58,159 --> 01:04:59,536
That is so baller!

1528
01:05:00,361 --> 01:05:02,238
Like a tiny blonde gangsta!

1529
01:05:02,363 --> 01:05:04,706
This little gangsta would kill
for a motherfucking ginger ale!

1530
01:05:05,867 --> 01:05:06,937
- Do you wanna go?
- Mmm-hmm.

1531
01:05:07,035 --> 01:05:08,490
Okay, let's go.

1532
01:05:08,570 --> 01:05:10,413
Hello, everyone. Please take your seats.

1533
01:05:10,805 --> 01:05:15,114
Welcome to the rehearsal dinner
for my man, Eric...

1534
01:05:15,210 --> 01:05:17,554
and his bride-to-be, the lovely Jeanie.

1535
01:05:17,645 --> 01:05:20,560
They're two of the sweetest, best people
I ever met.

1536
01:05:20,684 --> 01:05:22,960
All right. Our first speaker tonight...

1537
01:05:23,053 --> 01:05:24,841
is resident nasty girl...

1538
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:27,059
Cousin Terry.

1539
01:05:27,457 --> 01:05:28,993
We can't let Terry crush.

1540
01:05:29,292 --> 01:05:30,347
It's not fair!

1541
01:05:30,427 --> 01:05:31,633
No. Give it to me.

1542
01:05:31,728 --> 01:05:33,435
My eyes are dry. Just give it to me.

1543
01:05:33,830 --> 01:05:35,434
Do you guys know who Chris Rock is?

1544
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:39,037
He's my neighbor, and he helped me out
with a little something I like to call...

1545
01:05:39,302 --> 01:05:40,657
"My speech."

1546
01:05:40,737 --> 01:05:43,360
Stop. You're wasting it.
You're wasting the poison.

1547
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:44,561
Mike, this is baby safe.

1548
01:05:44,641 --> 01:05:47,597
They removed the active ingredient,
Tetrahydrozoline, like 20 years ago!

1549
01:05:47,677 --> 01:05:48,899
It worked on Wedding Crashers!

1550
01:05:48,979 --> 01:05:50,500
That was not real life!

1551
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:53,186
Now let's talk about destination weddings!

1552
01:05:53,850 --> 01:05:55,305
It's like a vacation...

1553
01:05:55,385 --> 01:05:57,228
without the relaxation!

1554
01:05:58,923 --> 01:06:00,079
That's true.

1555
01:06:00,159 --> 01:06:01,160
Why aren't you on my side, Dave?

1556
01:06:01,593 --> 01:06:02,614
What?

1557
01:06:02,694 --> 01:06:05,106
I'm done with this shit, man.
I'm not doing our stupid speech.

1558
01:06:05,330 --> 01:06:07,519
In fact, I'm quitting our liquor business.

1559
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:08,703
There it is!

1560
01:06:08,934 --> 01:06:10,004
- Really?
- Yeah.

1561
01:06:10,102 --> 01:06:11,206
And what are you gonna do?

1562
01:06:11,336 --> 01:06:12,691
I'm gonna draw!

1563
01:06:12,771 --> 01:06:15,894
I'm gonna work on my graphic novel,
and Mom's gonna help me cover the rent.

1564
01:06:15,974 --> 01:06:17,044
Boom!

1565
01:06:17,242 --> 01:06:18,263
You traitor!

1566
01:06:18,343 --> 01:06:19,378
I ain't gotta rehearse!

1567
01:06:19,912 --> 01:06:22,720
I know how to eat dinner.

1568
01:06:24,883 --> 01:06:25,918
Keith, can you turn me up a little bit?

1569
01:06:26,818 --> 01:06:29,830
You turn your back on me
when everyone else does.

1570
01:06:30,055 --> 01:06:33,063
Backstabbing, treacherous lying coward!

1571
01:06:33,292 --> 01:06:34,546
Ooh, I don't think they know they're on.

1572
01:06:34,626 --> 01:06:36,037
What? Where is that coming from?

1573
01:06:36,395 --> 01:06:37,635
I don't know what I did!

1574
01:06:37,729 --> 01:06:39,053
It doesn't matter, Mike.

1575
01:06:39,133 --> 01:06:40,544
You're losing your mind.

1576
01:06:40,734 --> 01:06:42,680
You just tried to poison our cousin Terry!

1577
01:06:44,038 --> 01:06:45,259
Try a little harder. Am I right?

1578
01:06:45,339 --> 01:06:46,494
You're goddamn right I did.

1579
01:06:46,574 --> 01:06:49,612
Because I wanted her to shit
hot brown poop all over that stage.

1580
01:06:50,511 --> 01:06:51,866
That is unacceptable.

1581
01:06:51,946 --> 01:06:53,801
The mics are on, boys.

1582
01:06:53,881 --> 01:06:56,770
I wanted her butt to explode
like a rotten cantaloupe.

1583
01:06:56,850 --> 01:06:58,038
The mics are on!

1584
01:06:58,118 --> 01:07:01,190
You're just fucking pissed off
because Tatiana finger diddled Terry.

1585
01:07:02,522 --> 01:07:04,063
There it is!

1586
01:07:04,325 --> 01:07:06,195
It was for tickets to Rihanna.

1587
01:07:06,327 --> 01:07:08,238
You're sad, man. You are sad.

1588
01:07:08,629 --> 01:07:11,235
I'm gonna kick your ass
just like when we were kids.

1589
01:07:15,803 --> 01:07:17,078
- Oh!
- My God!

1590
01:07:19,308 --> 01:07:20,563
- Do you wanna go?
- Don't do it!

1591
01:07:20,643 --> 01:07:21,864
These are coming your way.

1592
01:07:21,944 --> 01:07:23,279
Just stop!

1593
01:07:24,113 --> 01:07:25,786
God! That had to hurt.

1594
01:07:26,115 --> 01:07:27,423
Don't do it again.

1595
01:07:27,883 --> 01:07:28,884
Oh!

1596
01:07:31,153 --> 01:07:32,375
Why do you keep punching me?

1597
01:07:32,455 --> 01:07:33,866
Why do you keep rushing at me?

1598
01:07:34,023 --> 01:07:35,195
Get him, Dave.

1599
01:07:35,291 --> 01:07:36,412
Oops, who said that?

1600
01:07:36,492 --> 01:07:38,130
This wedding is going to hell!

1601
01:07:38,227 --> 01:07:39,382
Yes.

1602
01:07:39,462 --> 01:07:41,567
They're out there,
smiling like fucking idiots.

1603
01:07:42,131 --> 01:07:44,304
And they don't realize the bride...

1604
01:07:44,467 --> 01:07:46,389
is getting off at massage parlors...

1605
01:07:46,469 --> 01:07:48,778
like a goddamn Vietnam War veteran.

1606
01:07:50,339 --> 01:07:52,862
I think they misunderstood what happened.
I think they just misunderstood.

1607
01:07:52,942 --> 01:07:55,064
I walked in and saw little Jeanie...

1608
01:07:55,144 --> 01:07:56,934
the bride-to-be, orgasming.

1609
01:07:57,015 --> 01:07:59,404
The masseuse got her off.

1610
01:07:59,484 --> 01:08:00,838
God damn it!

1611
01:08:00,918 --> 01:08:01,988
Jeanie!

1612
01:08:02,420 --> 01:08:03,421
I hate you!

1613
01:08:17,502 --> 01:08:19,311
The rehearsal dinner is over.

1614
01:08:20,004 --> 01:08:23,008
Drinks by the pool, everybody.
Drinks by the pool.

1615
01:08:26,644 --> 01:08:29,181
Everything feels so good, right?

1616
01:08:29,314 --> 01:08:30,315
Yep.

1617
01:08:30,715 --> 01:08:32,237
You know what
I've been thinking about a lot?

1618
01:08:32,317 --> 01:08:33,387
Tell me.

1619
01:08:33,484 --> 01:08:35,407
Eric is so sweet and sensitive.

1620
01:08:35,487 --> 01:08:37,510
Kind, good, fiancé.

1621
01:08:37,590 --> 01:08:39,126
Probably great husband and stuff, but...

1622
01:08:40,226 --> 01:08:42,015
Do you think Eric is boring?

1623
01:08:42,095 --> 01:08:43,149
Boring?

1624
01:08:43,229 --> 01:08:44,401
Like for my honeymoon...

1625
01:08:44,831 --> 01:08:46,953
all I wanted to do
was go on a hot air balloon...

1626
01:08:47,033 --> 01:08:48,808
to different countries around the world.

1627
01:08:48,968 --> 01:08:51,157
And just be surrounded by wicker.

1628
01:08:51,237 --> 01:08:52,726
We could have wicker picnic baskets...

1629
01:08:52,806 --> 01:08:55,343
and I could make picnic hats
out of wicker.

1630
01:08:55,575 --> 01:08:57,564
We would be wearing
matching Chuck Taylors.

1631
01:08:57,644 --> 01:08:59,487
- And he vetoed it.
- Oh!

1632
01:08:59,913 --> 01:09:02,291
Because he wants to go to a resort,
and just...

1633
01:09:04,384 --> 01:09:05,939
- ...perch.
- What?

1634
01:09:06,019 --> 01:09:07,107
I am a young woman...

1635
01:09:07,187 --> 01:09:09,442
- Preach!
- There is so much for me to see.

1636
01:09:09,522 --> 01:09:11,832
- Yes.
- I haven't even been to Burning Man.

1637
01:09:12,292 --> 01:09:14,499
I don't even know what Amsterdam is like.

1638
01:09:15,029 --> 01:09:16,600
I haven't been to Seattle.

1639
01:09:16,732 --> 01:09:17,986
You've never been to Seattle?

1640
01:09:18,066 --> 01:09:19,087
No!

1641
01:09:19,167 --> 01:09:21,545
- Seattle's gonna change your fucking life!
- Really?

1642
01:09:21,636 --> 01:09:22,858
You need to get out of this cage!

1643
01:09:22,938 --> 01:09:23,992
I am in a cage...

1644
01:09:24,072 --> 01:09:26,552
just like these horses are caged.

1645
01:09:26,742 --> 01:09:28,619
Just let them out.

1646
01:09:28,810 --> 01:09:29,811
Huh?

1647
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:32,383
Let them all out.

1648
01:09:38,787 --> 01:09:41,410
Be free! No one can hold you down!

1649
01:09:41,490 --> 01:09:44,630
Be free, my friends! Follow your dreams!

1650
01:10:10,220 --> 01:10:11,460
Here to pile on?

1651
01:10:11,822 --> 01:10:12,823
Go ahead.

1652
01:10:12,923 --> 01:10:14,211
Any insult you can think of...

1653
01:10:14,291 --> 01:10:15,793
I've probably told myself a million times.

1654
01:10:15,926 --> 01:10:17,599
Why were you trying to poison your cousin?

1655
01:10:19,797 --> 01:10:25,022
I was jealous of the whole
steam room incident.

1656
01:10:25,102 --> 01:10:27,912
That is some crazy shit.
That's like something I would do.

1657
01:10:28,138 --> 01:10:29,760
This one time in high school...

1658
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:31,328
this bitch tried to hit on my boyfriend...

1659
01:10:31,408 --> 01:10:32,997
and I cut off her ponytail
while she was sleeping...

1660
01:10:33,077 --> 01:10:34,533
and I wore it to school for a month.

1661
01:10:34,613 --> 01:10:35,735
What the fuck?

1662
01:10:35,815 --> 01:10:37,351
But you tried to poison your cousin.

1663
01:10:50,830 --> 01:10:53,811
Look. I'm sorry I've been so rough
on you, okay?

1664
01:10:54,033 --> 01:10:57,742
I honestly think it's
because you're so much like me.

1665
01:10:57,970 --> 01:10:59,925
You act all confident...

1666
01:11:00,005 --> 01:11:03,009
but, inside, you're scared of everything.

1667
01:11:03,242 --> 01:11:04,949
You act like you don't care
what people think...

1668
01:11:05,044 --> 01:11:06,614
but you really care what people think.

1669
01:11:06,712 --> 01:11:07,933
And you try to act so smart...

1670
01:11:08,013 --> 01:11:09,635
but sometimes...

1671
01:11:09,715 --> 01:11:12,926
you're just afraid
you're the dumbest person in the world.

1672
01:11:15,690 --> 01:11:17,294
I'm so dumb.

1673
01:11:17,792 --> 01:11:21,262
I'm constantly saying words
that I don't know the meaning of.

1674
01:11:21,929 --> 01:11:24,273
Like, I use this word, "assuage"...

1675
01:11:24,532 --> 01:11:25,909
all the time.

1676
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:28,146
Can you assuage me the ketchup?

1677
01:11:28,269 --> 01:11:30,180
Can I assuage you a few questions?

1678
01:11:30,371 --> 01:11:33,181
- Is that the meaning of it?
- I don't know.

1679
01:11:33,274 --> 01:11:34,729
But it's like, I'm so stupid...

1680
01:11:34,809 --> 01:11:37,064
but I act all confident,
so people listen to me.

1681
01:11:37,144 --> 01:11:38,214
And it's fucked up.

1682
01:11:38,412 --> 01:11:40,323
Me, too. I'm a natural born leader.

1683
01:11:40,548 --> 01:11:42,303
Like George Washington.

1684
01:11:42,383 --> 01:11:43,471
Yeah.

1685
01:11:43,551 --> 01:11:44,791
Or another leader.

1686
01:11:52,362 --> 01:11:53,750
All right, here's one.

1687
01:11:53,830 --> 01:11:55,901
But I'm about to get super real
with you. Okay?

1688
01:11:57,367 --> 01:12:01,008
I thought I was destined
for such great things...

1689
01:12:01,104 --> 01:12:03,778
but I may never achieve anything.

1690
01:12:07,310 --> 01:12:08,550
Sister.

1691
01:12:09,913 --> 01:12:11,824
Have you been reading my diary?

1692
01:12:20,890 --> 01:12:21,925
Yes.

1693
01:12:22,892 --> 01:12:23,996
Okay.

1694
01:12:36,474 --> 01:12:37,762
You are beautiful!

1695
01:12:37,842 --> 01:12:39,219
On to Seattle!

1696
01:12:39,377 --> 01:12:40,481
Alice?

1697
01:12:41,513 --> 01:12:42,514
Am I glowing?

1698
01:12:42,781 --> 01:12:44,854
I can see sounds and hear colors.

1699
01:12:44,949 --> 01:12:46,287
Be free!

1700
01:12:46,451 --> 01:12:48,055
What the fuck are the horses doing out?

1701
01:12:48,987 --> 01:12:50,398
Who the fuck are you guys?

1702
01:12:50,655 --> 01:12:51,861
Fucking gypsies!

1703
01:12:52,023 --> 01:12:54,162
Francisco! Francisco, run!

1704
01:12:54,559 --> 01:12:56,505
Whoa! Shit!

1705
01:12:59,331 --> 01:13:00,385
Hey.

1706
01:13:00,465 --> 01:13:02,035
Dave! Hi.

1707
01:13:03,668 --> 01:13:04,990
What's up? What's up with you?

1708
01:13:05,070 --> 01:13:07,346
- What's going on? Are you okay?
- Me?

1709
01:13:07,505 --> 01:13:09,645
Yeah. I'm fine.

1710
01:13:11,411 --> 01:13:12,856
Oh. Yeah. Well...

1711
01:13:13,413 --> 01:13:15,188
Yeah. See, what happened was that...

1712
01:13:15,349 --> 01:13:17,671
there was a tsunami,
and it took away our clothes...

1713
01:13:17,751 --> 01:13:18,972
but it brought these horses.

1714
01:13:19,052 --> 01:13:20,040
What?

1715
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:22,342
And then, we wanted to get naked
because of Lady Godiva...

1716
01:13:22,422 --> 01:13:24,197
but then horses can't eat chocolate.

1717
01:13:24,358 --> 01:13:26,338
They could have an aneurysm.

1718
01:13:26,493 --> 01:13:27,699
Where's Jeanie?

1719
01:13:27,794 --> 01:13:29,149
Hey, don't yell at her
just because she's the one...

1720
01:13:29,229 --> 01:13:30,817
- that told me to go to Seattle.
- Holy shit!

1721
01:13:30,897 --> 01:13:32,553
- I've always wanted to go!
- Oh, my God!

1722
01:13:32,633 --> 01:13:34,421
That is not her fault.

1723
01:13:34,501 --> 01:13:35,946
- Oh, my eyes!
- What's the matter?

1724
01:13:36,103 --> 01:13:37,691
Stop yelling. Why are you yelling?
David, stop yelling.

1725
01:13:37,771 --> 01:13:39,409
You're being loud. And this a happy time.

1726
01:13:39,573 --> 01:13:40,916
This a really good time.

1727
01:13:41,074 --> 01:13:42,229
There's nothing wrong. So who's at fault?

1728
01:13:42,309 --> 01:13:44,687
Did you know that Hitler's parents
were second cousins?

1729
01:13:44,878 --> 01:13:46,414
- Do you have any water?
- Put your clothes on!

1730
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:49,789
I'm a woman, Dave. Deal with it.

1731
01:13:50,019 --> 01:13:53,728
Because this is the bush
that you came out of.

1732
01:13:53,889 --> 01:13:55,232
I didn't come from that bush.

1733
01:13:55,391 --> 01:13:57,098
I came from Mom's bush. And you know that.

1734
01:13:57,259 --> 01:13:58,704
Jeanie! Oh, my God!

1735
01:13:59,194 --> 01:14:00,571
You're completely naked!

1736
01:14:00,729 --> 01:14:03,073
- Hi, Becky!
- God, your bush is huge.

1737
01:14:03,232 --> 01:14:04,939
- You look tall.
- No, ma'am.

1738
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:07,512
I told you to stay away
from these bitches.

1739
01:14:07,770 --> 01:14:09,909
Alice, seriously, are you tripping?

1740
01:14:10,072 --> 01:14:11,060
No. God, no.

1741
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:13,313
Why would say that?
Just because everything feels really soft?

1742
01:14:13,609 --> 01:14:15,213
Please. Just tell me the truth.

1743
01:14:15,377 --> 01:14:16,447
Are you on drugs?

1744
01:14:17,279 --> 01:14:18,724
We're super fucked up. Yeah.

1745
01:14:18,881 --> 01:14:19,902
What?

1746
01:14:19,982 --> 01:14:22,394
We started with ecstasy,
but then I went into my mystery bags.

1747
01:14:22,551 --> 01:14:23,928
Why the fuck would you do that?

1748
01:14:24,086 --> 01:14:25,307
Don't you judge me, David.

1749
01:14:25,387 --> 01:14:27,142
I don't think you're supposed to
go into the mystery bag...

1750
01:14:27,222 --> 01:14:28,293
the night before the wedding.

1751
01:14:28,459 --> 01:14:30,598
We brought you here
because we thought you were nice girls.

1752
01:14:30,761 --> 01:14:32,604
But Mike was right about you two.

1753
01:14:32,763 --> 01:14:35,004
This whole wedding weekend
is just going to shit!

1754
01:14:35,166 --> 01:14:36,975
Dave, I'll be honest with you.

1755
01:14:37,134 --> 01:14:38,272
I need some clothes.

1756
01:14:39,303 --> 01:14:40,782
I can't continue to wear this horse.

1757
01:14:40,938 --> 01:14:42,474
Oh, my God.

1758
01:14:43,007 --> 01:14:44,315
Oh, the wind feels so nice.

1759
01:14:44,475 --> 01:14:46,349
Come on, come on, come on.

1760
01:14:47,711 --> 01:14:51,602
We should go in the ocean. I'm so thirsty!
Dave, we should get in the ocean.

1761
01:14:51,682 --> 01:14:54,839
Please, please, please, just be quiet.

1762
01:14:54,919 --> 01:14:56,407
I love this song.

1763
01:14:56,487 --> 01:14:57,830
There's no music playing.

1764
01:14:58,956 --> 01:14:59,957
Baby, wait.

1765
01:15:00,124 --> 01:15:02,035
Don't worry. Only our butts touched.

1766
01:15:02,193 --> 01:15:04,139
Stop it. Don't freak out anymore, Pumpkin!

1767
01:15:04,295 --> 01:15:06,332
Don't freak out? Don't freak out?

1768
01:15:06,530 --> 01:15:07,875
Tell me one thing.

1769
01:15:08,101 --> 01:15:09,307
Did you enjoy it?

1770
01:15:09,869 --> 01:15:11,473
No.

1771
01:15:12,438 --> 01:15:13,826
That is such a "yes" no.

1772
01:15:13,906 --> 01:15:14,961
No.

1773
01:15:15,041 --> 01:15:17,430
I'm gonna ask you again. Did you enjoy it?

1774
01:15:17,510 --> 01:15:18,498
Yes! Oh.

1775
01:15:18,578 --> 01:15:19,613
Well...

1776
01:15:19,879 --> 01:15:21,449
Cat's out of the frigging bag, isn't it?

1777
01:15:21,614 --> 01:15:23,525
I went for a normal massage...

1778
01:15:23,683 --> 01:15:25,720
but Alice, she had asked
for a little special treat.

1779
01:15:25,885 --> 01:15:27,796
And then it just kept coming,
and coming, and coming, and...

1780
01:15:27,954 --> 01:15:30,059
Who are these fucking girls
your brothers brought to this wedding?

1781
01:15:30,490 --> 01:15:33,027
You are clearly on drugs.

1782
01:15:33,192 --> 01:15:34,671
And we're getting married tomorrow!

1783
01:15:35,495 --> 01:15:37,338
I'm scared, Pumpkin.

1784
01:15:37,497 --> 01:15:38,737
Aren't you scared?

1785
01:15:38,898 --> 01:15:40,707
Well, yeah, now I am.

1786
01:15:41,234 --> 01:15:42,542
It's just that...

1787
01:15:43,236 --> 01:15:47,687
I'm just a little worried that you are...

1788
01:15:49,210 --> 01:15:50,211
boring.

1789
01:15:51,746 --> 01:15:53,089
What are you saying?

1790
01:15:53,248 --> 01:15:54,454
You don't want to marry me?

1791
01:16:05,326 --> 01:16:06,600
Well...

1792
01:16:06,761 --> 01:16:08,365
No, she doesn't mean that.
She's just confused...

1793
01:16:08,530 --> 01:16:09,770
because she's just rolling
super hard right now.

1794
01:16:09,931 --> 01:16:11,035
You rolled her!

1795
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:13,270
- You're the roller!
- I'm so sorry.

1796
01:16:13,434 --> 01:16:15,846
I was gonna draw Rum for you.
But not anymore.

1797
01:16:16,004 --> 01:16:17,984
Everything is not irie, man!

1798
01:16:20,408 --> 01:16:23,014
You've made me so, so sad.

1799
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:26,959
But a little bit mad.

1800
01:16:27,717 --> 01:16:29,128
But mostly just sad.

1801
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:31,121
Oh!

1802
01:16:33,089 --> 01:16:34,397
- Dad!
- Don't!

1803
01:16:34,558 --> 01:16:35,969
Mike, for once in your life...

1804
01:16:36,126 --> 01:16:39,107
please don't say a fucking word.

1805
01:17:03,553 --> 01:17:05,330
I hate them sometimes.

1806
01:17:05,490 --> 01:17:06,745
Fucking love them and they're dicks.

1807
01:17:06,825 --> 01:17:08,566
Sometimes I love them,
sometimes I hate them.

1808
01:17:16,635 --> 01:17:17,636
Everything okay over there?

1809
01:17:17,803 --> 01:17:20,215
I can't find my other sock.
It's pissing me off.

1810
01:17:23,108 --> 01:17:24,849
Did you take my sock, bro?

1811
01:17:25,010 --> 01:17:26,080
No.

1812
01:17:26,578 --> 01:17:28,956
I think you took my fucking sock, bro.

1813
01:17:30,582 --> 01:17:31,652
God damn it.

1814
01:17:31,783 --> 01:17:33,888
I can't believe Jeanie and Eric
aren't getting married...

1815
01:17:34,019 --> 01:17:35,828
and it's all our fault.

1816
01:17:36,488 --> 01:17:39,469
It's slightly our fault.

1817
01:17:40,425 --> 01:17:42,371
It's totally our fault. Fuck.

1818
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:44,873
We got selfish. We got distracted.

1819
01:17:46,467 --> 01:17:49,277
I don't think we were
#DoingltForJeanie at all.

1820
01:17:49,436 --> 01:17:51,313
We weren't #DoingltForJeanie.

1821
01:17:51,472 --> 01:17:54,316
Our fucking little sister.
Our little Jeanie Beanie Weanie.

1822
01:17:54,975 --> 01:17:56,852
She is Stanglita.

1823
01:17:57,011 --> 01:17:59,787
The one little girl
we used to let into our Stang Hangs.

1824
01:17:59,947 --> 01:18:00,935
The Stangle Dangle.

1825
01:18:01,015 --> 01:18:02,551
The smallest plane in the Stangar.

1826
01:18:02,716 --> 01:18:03,854
Don't do it, dude.

1827
01:18:04,018 --> 01:18:05,326
We're supposed to be her protector.

1828
01:18:05,486 --> 01:18:07,022
Don't you cry.

1829
01:18:07,187 --> 01:18:08,188
We're supposed to look out for her.

1830
01:18:08,355 --> 01:18:09,527
Stop it.

1831
01:18:09,690 --> 01:18:12,637
We're supposed to be the two dudes
that have her back no matter what.

1832
01:18:12,793 --> 01:18:14,238
If you start, I'm gonna start.

1833
01:18:14,395 --> 01:18:16,671
We broke up her marriage.

1834
01:18:19,466 --> 01:18:22,379
Of course I'm fucking doing it, man.
We ruined Jeanie's wedding.

1835
01:18:22,536 --> 01:18:23,983
I'm doing it, too.

1836
01:18:24,540 --> 01:18:25,717
I hate it.

1837
01:18:38,587 --> 01:18:41,210
Oh, man, we fucked up this wedding.

1838
01:18:41,290 --> 01:18:42,291
Yeah.

1839
01:18:42,458 --> 01:18:44,631
We fucked it in the dick.

1840
01:18:45,962 --> 01:18:47,617
You know I don't like it when you say that.
That's just...

1841
01:18:47,697 --> 01:18:50,405
I know, but we fucked it so hard. Fuck.

1842
01:18:50,499 --> 01:18:53,656
I think the reason we get ourselves
into so much shit is...

1843
01:18:53,736 --> 01:18:55,807
we're always telling each other
we're so awesome...

1844
01:18:56,072 --> 01:18:59,076
when we're definitely not being awesome.

1845
01:18:59,241 --> 01:19:00,549
That's deep.

1846
01:19:00,710 --> 01:19:02,521
Yeah, you know what? Um...

1847
01:19:04,115 --> 01:19:05,958
I wanted you to feel better...

1848
01:19:06,117 --> 01:19:08,290
and get your groove back...

1849
01:19:08,453 --> 01:19:11,593
but not all the way better to where...

1850
01:19:13,024 --> 01:19:15,026
you wouldn't need me anymore.

1851
01:19:15,193 --> 01:19:18,106
Because if you don't need me...

1852
01:19:19,597 --> 01:19:22,271
then nobody needs me, and, um...

1853
01:19:22,934 --> 01:19:26,211
Anyway, that's what I was thinking
when I was knuckles deep into Cousin Terry.

1854
01:19:26,871 --> 01:19:28,817
Dude, we're always gonna need each other.

1855
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:30,441
Okay.

1856
01:19:30,708 --> 01:19:34,751
Okay, here's the thing.
I don't wanna stop being us.

1857
01:19:34,912 --> 01:19:36,983
But I think occasionally...

1858
01:19:37,148 --> 01:19:41,393
we should think about
how we make other people feel.

1859
01:19:43,690 --> 01:19:44,678
Like Jeanie?

1860
01:19:44,758 --> 01:19:45,964
Yeah, like Jeanie.

1861
01:19:46,426 --> 01:19:48,133
- Oof.
- Or like Eric.

1862
01:19:48,595 --> 01:19:49,630
Oh, fuck.

1863
01:19:49,796 --> 01:19:51,434
This feels fucking terrible.

1864
01:19:51,598 --> 01:19:53,805
This does not feel good.

1865
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,742
Like, Dave's so special and...

1866
01:19:57,470 --> 01:19:59,848
He must be so mad at me.

1867
01:20:00,273 --> 01:20:01,343
Poor Mike.

1868
01:20:01,508 --> 01:20:04,853
He's less special,
but I played him so hard.

1869
01:20:05,011 --> 01:20:06,456
They must be so mad at us!

1870
01:20:06,613 --> 01:20:08,820
They must hate us. Fuck! I would hate us.

1871
01:20:08,982 --> 01:20:10,791
I would fucking hate us!

1872
01:20:10,950 --> 01:20:13,294
I hate us, man. I hate us!

1873
01:20:13,453 --> 01:20:14,591
I hate us, too!

1874
01:20:14,754 --> 01:20:16,461
But you're the best, dude. I love you.

1875
01:20:16,623 --> 01:20:18,967
Don't lump yourself in with me.

1876
01:20:19,125 --> 01:20:20,605
I'm like a little troll...

1877
01:20:20,762 --> 01:20:23,538
who lives on nothing but
river water and squirrel meats.

1878
01:20:23,698 --> 01:20:26,110
Your drawing?
I could never do anything like that.

1879
01:20:26,268 --> 01:20:28,457
- So go. You go right now.
- What?

1880
01:20:28,537 --> 01:20:29,591
Go!

1881
01:20:29,671 --> 01:20:33,050
Don't let your loser older brother
hold you back.

1882
01:20:36,511 --> 01:20:37,854
You are not a loser.

1883
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:40,182
Thanks, Dave.

1884
01:20:40,348 --> 01:20:41,850
Dude, you introduced me
to the Ninja Turtles.

1885
01:20:42,017 --> 01:20:43,860
Taught me Donatello was a pussy.

1886
01:20:44,019 --> 01:20:45,896
That Raphael was actually dope...

1887
01:20:46,054 --> 01:20:48,034
because he didn't give a fuck
what people thought.

1888
01:20:48,190 --> 01:20:49,464
He's cool, but rude.

1889
01:20:49,624 --> 01:20:50,864
Exactly.

1890
01:20:50,959 --> 01:20:53,064
When all those kids kicked at me
and they called me "Moist"...

1891
01:20:53,161 --> 01:20:56,040
you stopped eating muffins
at the school lunch for a year.

1892
01:20:56,198 --> 01:20:57,871
They were too moist.

1893
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,913
Made you an easy target.

1894
01:21:01,071 --> 01:21:04,575
You're my brother. And I love you.

1895
01:21:04,741 --> 01:21:06,311
Heroes in a half shell.

1896
01:21:06,477 --> 01:21:07,581
Turtle power.

1897
01:21:12,649 --> 01:21:14,856
We're not going anywhere...

1898
01:21:15,018 --> 01:21:18,693
until our little sister,
Jeanie Beanie Weanie...

1899
01:21:18,856 --> 01:21:20,563
is getting married.

1900
01:21:26,263 --> 01:21:27,503
You just killed the TV.

1901
01:21:28,031 --> 01:21:29,772
I was aiming for it.

1902
01:21:32,236 --> 01:21:35,046
We are such idiots. We are so stupid.

1903
01:21:35,205 --> 01:21:36,707
We ruined your whole wedding...

1904
01:21:36,874 --> 01:21:38,582
and we finally just realized that.

1905
01:21:38,743 --> 01:21:40,724
All right. Please just stop talking, okay?

1906
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:44,054
Not another word. My head hurts so bad.

1907
01:21:44,216 --> 01:21:45,422
Jeanie, Eric.

1908
01:21:45,584 --> 01:21:48,292
We can't let you not get married
just because we fucked everything up.

1909
01:21:48,454 --> 01:21:49,592
We love you so much, Jeanie.

1910
01:21:49,688 --> 01:21:51,759
We love you, Eric.
We just want you guys to love each other.

1911
01:21:51,857 --> 01:21:53,358
- Just love each other.
- That's it.

1912
01:21:54,927 --> 01:21:56,201
Jeanie, Eric.

1913
01:21:56,362 --> 01:21:57,864
We can't let you not get married.

1914
01:21:58,030 --> 01:21:59,634
Yeah. Just because
we fucked everything up?

1915
01:21:59,798 --> 01:22:01,243
I mean, we want you guys
to love each other.

1916
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:02,401
Love each other.

1917
01:22:03,569 --> 01:22:06,448
Okay. This is bizarre,
because we literally did that...

1918
01:22:06,605 --> 01:22:07,982
...exact same thing.

1919
01:22:08,140 --> 01:22:09,778
We're even doing this hand motion.

1920
01:22:09,942 --> 01:22:11,114
Yeah, all that was ours.

1921
01:22:11,277 --> 01:22:13,314
The point is, this shit is all our fault.

1922
01:22:13,479 --> 01:22:15,117
No, it's our fault.

1923
01:22:15,281 --> 01:22:16,954
No, it's definitely our fault.

1924
01:22:17,116 --> 01:22:18,222
It is our fault for sure.

1925
01:22:18,386 --> 01:22:19,387
No, no, no. For real.

1926
01:22:19,554 --> 01:22:20,999
If anything, it's my fault.

1927
01:22:22,723 --> 01:22:24,327
Shh! Please stop.

1928
01:22:26,594 --> 01:22:30,701
Everyone shut the fuck up!

1929
01:22:31,365 --> 01:22:33,709
Jesus Hussein Christ.

1930
01:22:33,868 --> 01:22:35,814
God damn it!

1931
01:22:35,937 --> 01:22:38,213
Been trying to read this same paragraph...

1932
01:22:38,439 --> 01:22:39,727
for 20 minutes.

1933
01:22:39,807 --> 01:22:44,347
But you four fucking morons
keep on fucking with my shit.

1934
01:22:45,046 --> 01:22:46,667
We've only been here for three minutes...

1935
01:22:46,747 --> 01:22:47,935
so those other 17 minutes...

1936
01:22:48,015 --> 01:22:49,203
- that's kind of on you...
- Mike!

1937
01:22:49,283 --> 01:22:50,538
I'm using hyperbole.

1938
01:22:50,618 --> 01:22:53,462
I don't know what that means,
and I think you know that I don't.

1939
01:22:53,588 --> 01:22:55,576
Mike, do me a favor. Shut the fuck up.

1940
01:22:55,656 --> 01:22:56,644
Go Eric.

1941
01:22:56,724 --> 01:22:57,780
Shut up too!

1942
01:22:57,860 --> 01:22:59,134
I mean, God damn it!

1943
01:22:59,295 --> 01:23:02,435
You're all self-absorbed,
barely-functioning...

1944
01:23:02,999 --> 01:23:04,239
codependent weirdos!

1945
01:23:05,401 --> 01:23:06,709
- Yeah.
- I know.

1946
01:23:06,803 --> 01:23:08,908
- That's pretty spot-on.
- We just figured that out.

1947
01:23:09,072 --> 01:23:11,828
- Those are not good qualities.
- We're gonna work on it.

1948
01:23:11,908 --> 01:23:13,897
- It's been a long time.
- It's been so many years.

1949
01:23:13,977 --> 01:23:15,581
We're both very confused.

1950
01:23:15,678 --> 01:23:17,783
No, no. You're not confused.

1951
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:20,003
You're just coming down off MDMA.

1952
01:23:20,083 --> 01:23:21,562
Sorry. Which I gave you.

1953
01:23:21,718 --> 01:23:24,392
And Eric, you can't blame her
for anything she said last night.

1954
01:23:24,554 --> 01:23:27,330
I've done so much stupid shit on E.

1955
01:23:27,490 --> 01:23:30,061
I got so dehydrated that
I was drinking puddle water...

1956
01:23:30,226 --> 01:23:31,398
and I had to go to the hospital...

1957
01:23:31,561 --> 01:23:34,167
'cause puddles are really dirty.

1958
01:23:34,364 --> 01:23:35,818
One time I was on peyote...

1959
01:23:35,898 --> 01:23:38,156
and I signed up for a T-Mobile plan.

1960
01:23:38,236 --> 01:23:39,991
One time I got high.

1961
01:23:40,071 --> 01:23:42,574
I read the back of a shampoo bottle
for 13 hours.

1962
01:23:43,608 --> 01:23:44,763
Because it said "repeat."

1963
01:23:44,843 --> 01:23:46,379
- Rinse and repeat.
- I get it.

1964
01:23:46,478 --> 01:23:49,516
Jeanie, I know you think
that Eric can be boring...

1965
01:23:49,781 --> 01:23:52,387
Enough of this talk of boring!

1966
01:23:52,917 --> 01:23:53,972
Damn it!

1967
01:23:54,052 --> 01:23:58,262
Sixty percent of my investments
are in some pretty aggressive stocks.

1968
01:23:58,390 --> 01:24:01,769
I don't always look both ways
when I cross the street.

1969
01:24:01,926 --> 01:24:04,916
I've been known to have
a second glass of wine...

1970
01:24:04,996 --> 01:24:06,818
with my dinner, every now and then.

1971
01:24:06,898 --> 01:24:08,553
I once went to see a movie...

1972
01:24:08,633 --> 01:24:11,122
walked across the hallway,
saw a second movie.

1973
01:24:11,202 --> 01:24:12,510
Didn't pay till after.

1974
01:24:12,704 --> 01:24:13,876
Is that boring?

1975
01:24:14,372 --> 01:24:15,361
Is that boring?

1976
01:24:15,441 --> 01:24:16,597
- What'd you say?
- Yeah.

1977
01:24:16,677 --> 01:24:18,213
- You're right. We were wrong.
- That was pretty boring.

1978
01:24:18,645 --> 01:24:19,885
Well, how about this for boring?

1979
01:24:21,748 --> 01:24:23,489
Bam!

1980
01:24:23,983 --> 01:24:26,256
Two hot air balloon tickets
for our honeymoon.

1981
01:24:26,386 --> 01:24:27,641
I know you really wanted to go...

1982
01:24:27,721 --> 01:24:30,600
so I got these tickets a while ago
to surprise you.

1983
01:24:30,957 --> 01:24:32,800
Surprise.

1984
01:24:32,959 --> 01:24:35,064
Aww!

1985
01:24:35,295 --> 01:24:36,797
Baby, you're so afraid of heights.

1986
01:24:37,431 --> 01:24:39,877
- Baby, I'm fucking terrified of heights.
- Yeah.

1987
01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:42,422
But my biggest fear...

1988
01:24:42,502 --> 01:24:44,641
is to not be the husband that you deserve.

1989
01:24:45,939 --> 01:24:48,818
Baby, I'm sorry I fucked
so much of this up...

1990
01:24:49,509 --> 01:24:50,631
but I promise that masseuse...

1991
01:24:50,711 --> 01:24:52,699
He didn't touch my lavender juice box.

1992
01:24:52,779 --> 01:24:54,623
Oh, God, baby. I love you.

1993
01:24:55,184 --> 01:24:56,925
And I know I want to marry you.

1994
01:24:57,252 --> 01:25:00,165
Today, if you'll still have me.

1995
01:25:00,656 --> 01:25:03,102
Babe, of course. Are you kidding me?

1996
01:25:06,562 --> 01:25:07,549
Kiss her.

1997
01:25:07,629 --> 01:25:09,472
Baby, I'm crazy about you.

1998
01:25:21,944 --> 01:25:22,945
Aww!

1999
01:25:23,679 --> 01:25:25,181
I want to marry you right now...

2000
01:25:25,347 --> 01:25:27,293
but, baby, we already canceled
all the vendors.

2001
01:25:27,783 --> 01:25:29,524
I don't think they're going to
let us get married here.

2002
01:25:31,086 --> 01:25:32,156
Leave that to us.

2003
01:25:33,623 --> 01:25:35,262
Leave that to all of us.

2004
01:25:36,594 --> 01:25:37,732
- Yeah!
- Let's go, Mike.

2005
01:25:38,362 --> 01:25:39,932
This way! Oh, fuck!

2006
01:25:40,364 --> 01:25:41,843
We'll actually just head around.

2007
01:25:42,099 --> 01:25:43,578
- Girl.
- I'm good.

2008
01:25:43,868 --> 01:25:45,323
So what part you like, brah?

2009
01:25:45,403 --> 01:25:47,558
- We need the whole pig.
- I can't give you a whole pig.

2010
01:25:47,638 --> 01:25:49,174
But we need to feed 100 people.

2011
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:52,463
Could we please, please
have the wedding here?

2012
01:25:52,543 --> 01:25:54,580
For the last time, we're out of venues.

2013
01:25:54,712 --> 01:25:57,056
- Hold me back. Hold me back, please.
- What?

2014
01:25:57,314 --> 01:25:58,336
Give us a place!

2015
01:25:58,416 --> 01:26:00,191
Everybody out of the way!

2016
01:26:00,384 --> 01:26:02,039
It's hot. So hot!

2017
01:26:02,119 --> 01:26:03,621
- Out of the fucking way!
- I want my pig back!

2018
01:26:04,388 --> 01:26:06,177
What if I supplied all the liquor...

2019
01:26:06,257 --> 01:26:08,245
for every bar in this hotel...

2020
01:26:08,325 --> 01:26:10,915
at wholesale prices
for the next three years?

2021
01:26:10,995 --> 01:26:12,873
- Deal.
- Yes! Fuck yes!

2022
01:26:13,065 --> 01:26:14,339
I'll get you guys a venue.

2023
01:26:28,314 --> 01:26:29,315
Keith, get it together.

2024
01:26:29,649 --> 01:26:30,821
We need to move, move, move.

2025
01:26:31,050 --> 01:26:32,120
I'm doing my best.

2026
01:26:35,788 --> 01:26:36,892
Hell yeah!

2027
01:26:54,843 --> 01:26:57,420
And now... a reading...

2028
01:26:58,079 --> 01:27:00,218
from the children's book
that I got in the lobby.

2029
01:27:00,515 --> 01:27:02,153
- Oh.
- "Aloha moon.

2030
01:27:02,550 --> 01:27:04,223
"Aloha sea.

2031
01:27:04,385 --> 01:27:05,762
"Aloha you.

2032
01:27:06,387 --> 01:27:07,457
"Aloha me."

2033
01:27:07,755 --> 01:27:09,325
- I do.
- I do.

2034
01:27:09,524 --> 01:27:10,867
By the power vested in me...

2035
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:14,597
by the website www.beyourowndeacon.com...

2036
01:27:15,530 --> 01:27:18,773
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

2037
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:20,855
Those assholes kind of did it.

2038
01:27:20,935 --> 01:27:22,346
Yeah.

2039
01:27:22,670 --> 01:27:24,343
Those assholes kind of did.

2040
01:27:24,506 --> 01:27:25,693
You may kiss the bride.

2041
01:27:25,773 --> 01:27:27,295
Okay. Kiss the bride.

2042
01:27:27,375 --> 01:27:28,513
Kiss the bride.

2043
01:27:35,852 --> 01:27:36,853
Yeah!

2044
01:27:49,266 --> 01:27:50,887
- You designed this?
- Yeah.

2045
01:27:50,967 --> 01:27:53,356
Insane. We're at a wedding,
it's in the shape of a heart.

2046
01:27:53,436 --> 01:27:54,991
That was a really good idea.

2047
01:27:55,071 --> 01:27:56,607
I have so many good ideas.

2048
01:27:56,873 --> 01:27:59,547
At my last job, I was on fire with ideas.

2049
01:27:59,643 --> 01:28:01,816
Huh? Actually, I need a new partner...

2050
01:28:02,145 --> 01:28:05,354
because Dave is bailing on me
to draw things.

2051
01:28:05,815 --> 01:28:07,317
Would you wanna...

2052
01:28:07,551 --> 01:28:08,996
maybe come work for me?

2053
01:28:09,319 --> 01:28:10,321
Really?

2054
01:28:10,589 --> 01:28:12,000
What do you know about liquor?

2055
01:28:12,457 --> 01:28:15,301
Um, only that it's delicious and I love it.

2056
01:28:15,427 --> 01:28:17,182
And those are
the two things you need to know.

2057
01:28:17,262 --> 01:28:20,539
- You are hired.
- Great. When do I start?

2058
01:28:20,732 --> 01:28:21,972
You can start right away...

2059
01:28:22,434 --> 01:28:24,880
but just know that there will be
some late nights.

2060
01:28:24,970 --> 01:28:26,643
Keep it in your pants, okay?

2061
01:28:27,005 --> 01:28:28,507
If we're going to work together,
let's just...

2062
01:28:28,941 --> 01:28:30,477
keep it professional.

2063
01:28:31,076 --> 01:28:32,146
Okay.

2064
01:28:32,277 --> 01:28:34,533
- We'll keep it professional, then.
- Good.

2065
01:28:34,613 --> 01:28:35,601
- All right.
- Good.

2066
01:28:35,681 --> 01:28:36,702
- Okay.
- Okay.

2067
01:28:36,782 --> 01:28:37,769
- Okay.
- Yeah.

2068
01:28:37,849 --> 01:28:39,328
- Are you sure?
- I don't know.

2069
01:28:40,752 --> 01:28:41,856
What?

2070
01:28:43,488 --> 01:28:44,967
- What'd you say?
- What?

2071
01:28:45,490 --> 01:28:47,663
Love me tender

2072
01:28:48,327 --> 01:28:50,172
Love me sweet

2073
01:28:52,166 --> 01:28:53,577
Never let me go

2074
01:28:57,671 --> 01:29:01,744
You have made my life complete

2075
01:29:05,846 --> 01:29:06,847
I don't.

2076
01:29:10,084 --> 01:29:11,893
Love me tender

2077
01:29:12,753 --> 01:29:14,357
Love me true

2078
01:29:16,390 --> 01:29:19,269
All my dreams fulfilled

2079
01:29:23,230 --> 01:29:26,541
For my darlin' I love you

2080
01:29:26,834 --> 01:29:28,645
Tatiana said this was gonna happen.

2081
01:29:28,904 --> 01:29:29,992
You got my groove back.

2082
01:29:30,072 --> 01:29:31,093
Really?

2083
01:29:31,173 --> 01:29:32,982
That's the sweetest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

2084
01:29:39,982 --> 01:29:41,052
I like you.

2085
01:29:48,224 --> 01:29:49,579
Wait. There's people everywhere.

2086
01:29:49,659 --> 01:29:51,730
- Let them watch.
- Mmm. Okay.

2087
01:29:54,063 --> 01:29:55,098
Whoa!

2088
01:29:55,631 --> 01:29:57,353
Hi, everyone.

2089
01:29:57,433 --> 01:29:59,845
Excuse us. Could we have
your attention, please?

2090
01:30:01,237 --> 01:30:03,359
My husband and I...

2091
01:30:03,439 --> 01:30:07,163
want to thank
four very incredible people...

2092
01:30:07,243 --> 01:30:09,020
for saving the day.

2093
01:30:09,313 --> 01:30:12,692
Mike and Dave have asked
to say a few words...

2094
01:30:12,950 --> 01:30:14,739
so we would like to invite them up.

2095
01:30:14,819 --> 01:30:15,854
Come on, boys.

2096
01:30:17,622 --> 01:30:18,623
Thank you, Jeanie.

2097
01:30:19,257 --> 01:30:22,313
We never got to give our speech
at the rehearsal dinner.

2098
01:30:22,393 --> 01:30:24,771
Because we ruined it. With fights.

2099
01:30:25,596 --> 01:30:27,132
But we just wanted
everybody here to know...

2100
01:30:27,632 --> 01:30:29,134
exactly how we feel about you.

2101
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:30,635
Lights.

2102
01:30:35,506 --> 01:30:37,612
Did you know this was coming?

2103
01:30:47,654 --> 01:30:52,125
You are so beautiful

2104
01:30:52,625 --> 01:30:55,071
So beautiful

2105
01:30:55,395 --> 01:30:56,396
Aww.

2106
01:30:58,331 --> 01:30:59,452
To me

2107
01:30:59,532 --> 01:31:00,636
Aww.

2108
01:31:01,701 --> 01:31:03,456
Can't you see?

2109
01:31:03,536 --> 01:31:05,243
You're so beautiful

2110
01:31:05,638 --> 01:31:07,208
This is real beautiful, man.

2111
01:31:07,507 --> 01:31:11,751
You're everything I hoped for

2112
01:31:12,145 --> 01:31:14,401
- In a little sister!
- Oh!

2113
01:31:14,481 --> 01:31:18,238
You're everything I need

2114
01:31:18,318 --> 01:31:21,390
Everything that I need

2115
01:31:22,455 --> 01:31:23,866
They're kind of good.

2116
01:31:23,957 --> 01:31:25,732
You are so beautiful

2117
01:31:26,361 --> 01:31:27,635
As a couple. Right guys?

2118
01:31:28,296 --> 01:31:29,502
Oh!

2119
01:31:29,698 --> 01:31:30,768
To me

2120
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:33,804
And to you.

2121
01:31:34,269 --> 01:31:35,805
And to you. To all of us.

2122
01:31:35,904 --> 01:31:37,383
You're beautiful, Jeanie!

2123
01:31:41,543 --> 01:31:43,022
Dave, everybody.

2124
01:31:43,545 --> 01:31:45,081
He's gonna draw!

2125
01:31:45,413 --> 01:31:46,653
Love you!

2126
01:31:47,949 --> 01:31:49,053
So sweet.

2127
01:31:49,317 --> 01:31:50,939
Thought they were gonna blow it.
They did not.

2128
01:31:51,019 --> 01:31:52,020
That's good.

2129
01:31:52,387 --> 01:31:55,061
This is how we do it

2130
01:31:57,025 --> 01:31:58,698
This is how we do it

2131
01:32:01,730 --> 01:32:03,903
This is how we do it

2132
01:32:04,232 --> 01:32:06,145
This is how we do it

2133
01:32:06,336 --> 01:32:07,758
It's Friday night

2134
01:32:07,838 --> 01:32:08,839
Oh, you don't throw...

2135
01:32:08,939 --> 01:32:10,145
And I feel all right

2136
01:32:10,874 --> 01:32:13,197
The party's here on the west side

2137
01:32:13,277 --> 01:32:15,733
So I reach for my forty and I turn it up

2138
01:32:15,813 --> 01:32:18,020
Designated driver got the keys to my truck

2139
01:32:18,115 --> 01:32:20,254
- Hit the shore 'cause I'm faded
- Faded

2140
01:32:20,350 --> 01:32:21,338
Honey on the streets saying

2141
01:32:21,418 --> 01:32:22,522
Monty, yo, we made it

2142
01:32:22,686 --> 01:32:24,808
I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because

2143
01:32:24,888 --> 01:32:26,731
This is how we do it

2144
01:32:26,824 --> 01:32:29,327
South Central does it like nobody does

2145
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:31,081
This is how we do it

2146
01:32:31,161 --> 01:32:32,149
All right.

2147
01:32:32,229 --> 01:32:36,441
To all my neighbors, you got much flavor
This is how we do it

2148
01:32:36,667 --> 01:32:39,944
# StangleBenoit2016.

2149
01:32:40,771 --> 01:32:42,648
Hell yeah!

2150
01:32:43,707 --> 01:32:44,983
Oh, God!

2151
01:32:45,377 --> 01:32:46,412
Well...

2152
01:32:47,746 --> 01:32:49,350
I picked a bad pose, guys.

2153
01:32:49,849 --> 01:32:50,884
Fireworks!

2154
01:32:51,951 --> 01:32:53,555
These are for you, Jeanie!

2155
01:32:54,720 --> 01:32:56,666
Fireworks close the show!

2156
01:32:58,724 --> 01:33:00,499
Those are from China, those fireworks.

2157
01:33:15,241 --> 01:33:17,551
You idiots! You fucking...

2158
01:33:30,391 --> 01:33:31,879
This is cool.

2159
01:33:31,959 --> 01:33:33,495
I didn't know you could do it this way.

2160
01:33:33,628 --> 01:33:34,971
Oh...

2161
01:33:37,765 --> 01:33:38,820
I'm done.

2162
01:33:38,900 --> 01:33:40,555
Fuck. Holy shit.

2163
01:33:40,635 --> 01:33:41,656
Okay.

2164
01:33:41,736 --> 01:33:43,238
That was great. Good job.

2165
01:33:57,551 --> 01:33:59,273
I'm so behind right now
on Game of Thrones.

2166
01:33:59,353 --> 01:34:02,779
I don't even know what's happening
with Khaleesi and her Dothraki boyfriend.

2167
01:34:02,859 --> 01:34:05,703
Okay. Well he's dead, and so is Jon Snow.

2168
01:34:05,795 --> 01:34:06,916
Jon Snow?

2169
01:34:06,996 --> 01:34:08,873
Fuck that dude.
I'm taller than him anyways.

2170
01:34:08,998 --> 01:34:10,477
Saw him.

2171
01:34:11,234 --> 01:34:14,644
I just found out some spelunker
went dunkin' in your bunker.

2172
01:34:16,239 --> 01:34:19,395
You are fresh as a fucking dick
in the morning.

2173
01:34:19,475 --> 01:34:20,964
That's not that fresh.

2174
01:34:21,044 --> 01:34:23,456
Have you ever sucked a dick
in the morning?

2175
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:26,302
I brush my teeth with dick, girl.

2176
01:34:26,382 --> 01:34:28,758
- Alright...
- What?

2177
01:34:28,851 --> 01:34:30,523
Oh. Fox don't like that joke?

2178
01:34:32,121 --> 01:34:34,328
I'm gonna throw up. You look like meat!

2179
01:34:34,424 --> 01:34:35,903
Inner dialogue, inner dialogue.

2180
01:34:36,025 --> 01:34:37,547
I once got lockjaw so bad

2181
01:34:37,627 --> 01:34:39,300
that I was sucking a homeless man's thumb.

2182
01:34:39,395 --> 01:34:40,917
Dave actually had to
come get me from the hospital...

2183
01:34:40,997 --> 01:34:44,789
because they found 13 Pokemon pugs
and a skimmer...

2184
01:34:44,869 --> 01:34:46,246
shoved up my butthole.

2185
01:34:46,438 --> 01:34:48,782
I just had to wait to poop them out.

2186
01:34:49,441 --> 01:34:51,045
Pikachu.

2187
01:34:51,609 --> 01:34:52,815
Pikachu.

2188
01:34:53,478 --> 01:34:54,684
Charmander.

2189
01:34:55,046 --> 01:34:58,925
That's okay. No, no. Keep your dick in.

2190
01:35:00,652 --> 01:35:02,941
For most of my life,
I thought goat cheese...

2191
01:35:03,021 --> 01:35:06,059
was a slang term
for cheese that's gone bad.

2192
01:35:06,157 --> 01:35:09,414
I'd see moldy cheese and I'd be, like,
"Dude, that cheese is goat."

2193
01:35:09,494 --> 01:35:11,303
Like, "Get that goat cheese
off the counter."

2194
01:35:11,529 --> 01:35:14,085
You look like a deconstructed taco.

2195
01:35:14,165 --> 01:35:15,200
Like carnival food.

2196
01:35:15,333 --> 01:35:18,314
Like the waffle that the chef would just go,
"We're throwing that away."

2197
01:35:18,436 --> 01:35:20,443
What are we doing?

2198
01:35:42,796 --> 01:35:45,640
And the home

2199
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:50,272
Of the

2200
01:35:52,205 --> 01:35:55,277
Brave

2201
01:35:57,778 --> 01:35:59,223
Play ball, Mike.

2202
01:36:05,187 --> 01:36:07,309
You know we saw my nigga

2203
01:36:07,389 --> 01:36:09,845
Mike and me forever
It's the Stang life, bitch

2204
01:36:09,925 --> 01:36:12,514
Stang life, getting rich
Selling fucking liquor quick

2205
01:36:12,594 --> 01:36:14,870
Mike and me forever
It's the Stang life, bitch

2206
01:36:14,963 --> 01:36:17,920
Stang life
I will never die I'm a Stangle, bitch

2207
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,622
Hunchback of Notre D on the B

2208
01:36:20,702 --> 01:36:23,759
Flying fucking girls
to my sister's wedding at the beach

2209
01:36:23,839 --> 01:36:27,582
Now we in first class seats
Couldn't hold me back, G

2210
01:36:28,043 --> 01:36:32,401
Jeanie Stangie being wild
Sippin' Cristal, sippin', sippin' Cristal

2211
01:36:32,481 --> 01:36:33,569
Sippin', sippin' Cristal

2212
01:36:33,649 --> 01:36:35,458
Jeanie, Jeanie, Jeanie Beanie Weanie

2213
01:36:35,584 --> 01:36:38,574
Gettin' married with Eric
Guaranteed he's got a big, big weenie

2214
01:36:38,654 --> 01:36:41,946
I'm proud of my little sister
Proud that she got a wedding ring

2215
01:36:42,026 --> 01:36:45,483
And a necklace, Eric you're my brother now
So that means I'm kinda black

2216
01:36:45,563 --> 01:36:47,372
Oh, wait. Not really. I'm white, man.

2217
01:36:47,465 --> 01:36:49,120
I'm just happy to be
related to you, honestly.

2218
01:36:49,200 --> 01:36:50,421
- Shout out to Eric.
- Eric!

2219
01:36:50,501 --> 01:36:52,823
I be like Superman, let me out the cage

2220
01:36:52,903 --> 01:36:55,126
I got out of my cast
and I flipped the page

2221
01:36:55,206 --> 01:36:57,795
And now I'm drawing comic books
like I used to do

2222
01:36:57,875 --> 01:37:01,298
Kinda cool,
