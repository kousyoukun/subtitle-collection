1
00:00:27,326 --> 00:00:31,103
Oh, no, oh, no

2
00:00:34,233 --> 00:00:40,426
Ahhh, oh, no, ahhh, oh, no

3
00:00:40,506 --> 00:00:43,596
Ahhh, oh, no

4
00:00:43,676 --> 00:00:49,127
No, she don't mess around
No, she don't mess around

5
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:55,765
100% blue agave.

6
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:57,344
Taste it.

7
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:59,028
Look, Mike, I like you.

8
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:01,502
But no one's looking
for another brand of tequila.

9
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:02,936
They've got the three... What is it?

10
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:04,973
The Cuervo, the other one,
and the third one.

11
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:06,677
And they don't need more tequila.

12
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:09,675
- If I can't sell it, it's not gonna sell.
- People want the new-new.

13
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:11,213
- The "new-new"?
- The "new-new."

14
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:12,492
They want that new-new.

15
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:13,594
No!

16
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:16,177
What if I could sell this tequila
to a customer?

17
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:18,414
- Would I have your order then?
- Yeah, sure.

18
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:20,252
And I'm just gonna pick a customer
at random.

19
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,582
Excuse me, sir.

20
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:24,819
Do you enjoy the taste of tequila?

21
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:26,890
Why, yes, I do.

22
00:01:27,055 --> 00:01:30,264
But I only drink my particular brand,
and you will not convince me otherwise.

23
00:01:30,558 --> 00:01:32,401
- It's a perfect candidate.
- Because it's your brother!

24
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:33,764
I know that's your brother.

25
00:01:34,028 --> 00:01:35,234
He dated my niece.

26
00:01:35,363 --> 00:01:36,398
Look, mate, I don't know your niece.

27
00:01:36,631 --> 00:01:38,406
- Okay.
- But if I did...

28
00:01:38,566 --> 00:01:41,376
I'd say she was a little clingy,
and she'd freak a lot of people out.

29
00:01:41,536 --> 00:01:43,311
We play Wards With Friends
together, right?

30
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:46,475
- Dave, right?
- Name's Rick. Just got in from Melbourne.

31
00:01:46,641 --> 00:01:47,642
His name's Rick.

32
00:01:47,809 --> 00:01:49,015
I know he's your brother.

33
00:01:49,243 --> 00:01:51,553
Look, look, look.
You guys are funny, you're weird.

34
00:01:51,713 --> 00:01:53,056
We do this every couple weeks...

35
00:01:54,482 --> 00:01:55,703
All right, I'll take 10 cases.

36
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:56,784
- Fuck, yes!
- Yes!

37
00:01:56,918 --> 00:01:57,919
Yes! I knew it!

38
00:01:58,152 --> 00:02:00,308
- We sold your ass, Randy!
- I don't know if that's what happened.

39
00:02:00,388 --> 00:02:01,696
- It was the hat, right?
- Was it the hat?

40
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:02,790
I just found this over there.

41
00:02:09,732 --> 00:02:10,870
Do something crazy

42
00:02:10,967 --> 00:02:13,102
Live like it's Mardi Gras

43
00:02:13,202 --> 00:02:14,857
And go jump, make the party start

44
00:02:14,937 --> 00:02:16,825
Don't need no R&R

45
00:02:16,905 --> 00:02:18,748
To regular life, I say Au revoir

46
00:02:18,841 --> 00:02:21,163
Yay! Living life in the fast lane

47
00:02:21,243 --> 00:02:22,779
Now your pain only be champagne

48
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:26,416
So please come join me
One thing, good vibes only

49
00:02:26,882 --> 00:02:30,455
Start the keg, I'mma fill my cup

50
00:02:30,552 --> 00:02:33,931
Got fireworks, got booze
Let's blow some shit up

51
00:02:34,723 --> 00:02:36,464
Tonight I'm going stupid

52
00:02:36,558 --> 00:02:38,196
Doing things I've never done

53
00:02:38,694 --> 00:02:40,883
We all got one thing in common

54
00:02:40,963 --> 00:02:42,807
We just wanna have fun

55
00:02:45,902 --> 00:02:47,108
Do something crazy

56
00:02:48,204 --> 00:02:49,205
Okay

57
00:02:49,939 --> 00:02:50,940
Do something crazy

58
00:02:53,877 --> 00:02:54,878
Do what you wanna do

59
00:02:57,814 --> 00:02:58,815
Do something crazy

60
00:03:01,818 --> 00:03:02,819
I'm about to do

61
00:03:03,887 --> 00:03:04,888
I'm about to do

62
00:03:05,922 --> 00:03:06,923
Do something crazy

63
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,591
Do something crazy

64
00:03:08,792 --> 00:03:10,829
Do something wild

65
00:03:10,927 --> 00:03:12,463
Rolling with the homies

66
00:03:12,562 --> 00:03:14,584
Chicks by my side

67
00:03:14,664 --> 00:03:16,803
Live for the moment

68
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,675
All of the time

69
00:03:18,768 --> 00:03:20,679
Turn up the music

70
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:22,478
Only good vibes

71
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,428
Sorry to throw the accent at you, bro.

72
00:03:24,508 --> 00:03:26,010
No, dude. I loved it,
and it kept me in the now.

73
00:03:26,343 --> 00:03:29,119
Do you realize that that sale puts us
at number three in the office?

74
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,782
The Stangle bros are killing it right now!

75
00:03:32,016 --> 00:03:34,087
It's not an actual hat.
They just call it a jimmy hat.

76
00:03:34,251 --> 00:03:35,423
If you wear two, they break.

77
00:03:35,586 --> 00:03:37,691
- It's an urban legend...
- No, it's not.

78
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:39,824
Mom, Dad?

79
00:03:40,658 --> 00:03:41,830
Jeanie. Eric.

80
00:03:41,992 --> 00:03:44,836
Don't freak out.
I don't want you to freak out.

81
00:03:44,995 --> 00:03:46,065
Just come on in.

82
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,185
Why don't we all just sit down?

83
00:03:48,265 --> 00:03:49,266
We gotta talk to you.

84
00:03:50,401 --> 00:03:51,744
We wanna discuss
Jeanie and Eric's wedding.

85
00:03:52,002 --> 00:03:53,106
- Oh! Sweet.
- Okay.

86
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,716
Are you guys thinking DJ or band?
First thought, band, right?

87
00:03:55,873 --> 00:03:57,443
No. People want to hear the real songs.

88
00:03:57,608 --> 00:03:59,884
You don't want to hear a guy
singing Beyoncé.

89
00:03:59,977 --> 00:04:01,266
You just want to hear Beyoncé.

90
00:04:01,346 --> 00:04:02,334
Oh.

91
00:04:02,414 --> 00:04:04,603
Yeah, but we want to talk about...

92
00:04:04,683 --> 00:04:06,492
is you two.

93
00:04:07,953 --> 00:04:09,364
Now, over the years...

94
00:04:09,654 --> 00:04:12,567
a theme has emerged
at our family gatherings.

95
00:04:12,724 --> 00:04:14,101
Everyone's having a good time...

96
00:04:14,392 --> 00:04:16,581
- That's right.
- Things are going smoothly.

97
00:04:16,661 --> 00:04:17,783
Party time.

98
00:04:17,863 --> 00:04:19,918
And then you two show up...

99
00:04:19,998 --> 00:04:20,999
stag...

100
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:22,334
and you hit on girls...

101
00:04:22,567 --> 00:04:23,637
you act like idiots...

102
00:04:23,802 --> 00:04:25,372
and you ruin it.

103
00:04:25,537 --> 00:04:26,538
Ruin it.

104
00:04:26,705 --> 00:04:28,946
- What? We are not party ruiners!
- Mm-mm.

105
00:04:29,241 --> 00:04:30,447
We're party creators!

106
00:04:30,742 --> 00:04:33,552
And besides, when have we ever
ruined a family event?

107
00:04:33,845 --> 00:04:35,000
Ah!

108
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,218
We thought you might say that.

109
00:04:36,381 --> 00:04:37,435
Yep, here we go. And we just stream it.

110
00:04:37,515 --> 00:04:38,503
Apple TV.

111
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:39,619
We just need your password.

112
00:04:39,852 --> 00:04:41,263
- Bryan's baby dick 69.
- Yeah.

113
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,899
Bryan's baby dick 69.

114
00:04:43,222 --> 00:04:44,826
What the fuck, guys? Really?

115
00:04:44,991 --> 00:04:46,012
- Got it. Yep.
- Is that it?

116
00:04:46,092 --> 00:04:47,093
Good.

117
00:04:48,728 --> 00:04:50,674
Happy Fourth of July!

118
00:04:52,064 --> 00:04:53,099
Oh, shit!

119
00:04:57,103 --> 00:04:58,582
It was fun up to that point.

120
00:05:07,546 --> 00:05:09,617
God damn it! My trailer!

121
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,247
Oh, shit.

122
00:05:19,327 --> 00:05:21,133
Actually, this is what
we're trying to avoid.

123
00:05:22,562 --> 00:05:24,633
- The both of you are fucking idiots.
- Fucking losers!

124
00:05:33,807 --> 00:05:36,811
Grandpa, wake up! Take his tie.

125
00:05:36,977 --> 00:05:40,067
Are you saying we had something to do
with Grandfather's death? Hmm?

126
00:05:40,147 --> 00:05:42,218
He died five years after that!

127
00:05:42,382 --> 00:05:44,293
That is a lot of guilt to put us.
Shame on you.

128
00:05:44,451 --> 00:05:46,829
Plus, this video only shows the screw-ups.

129
00:05:47,087 --> 00:05:49,260
Where's the epic tracking
shots of smiling faces?

130
00:05:49,957 --> 00:05:51,561
And everybody looking at us, just going...

131
00:05:51,725 --> 00:05:53,762
"God, I love Mike and Dave.

132
00:05:53,927 --> 00:05:56,032
"They made this whole party worth it."

133
00:05:56,296 --> 00:05:58,777
When are the two of you going to grow up?

134
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,105
This shtick was cute for a while...

135
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:02,680
but it's gotten stale.

136
00:06:02,837 --> 00:06:04,748
Mom, come on, what are you...

137
00:06:05,473 --> 00:06:08,113
You're talking about us like
we're a couple of losers or something.

138
00:06:08,276 --> 00:06:11,348
What we don't want you to do is
go chasing girls and get out of control.

139
00:06:11,512 --> 00:06:14,255
- You understand?
- Wait, we can still talk to girls, right?

140
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:17,325
- You can each talk to one girl.
- The girls that you bring to the wedding.

141
00:06:18,019 --> 00:06:20,998
- What do you mean?
- I want you to bring a date.

142
00:06:21,155 --> 00:06:25,647
- That's two dates.
- You want us to bring dates to a wedding?

143
00:06:25,727 --> 00:06:27,932
- Excuse me?
- Are you allowed to do that?

144
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,768
Nice, respectable, smart girls!
Keep you in line.

145
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,138
- What the fuck?
- What?

146
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,643
- Are you insane?
- Oh, you're kidding.

147
00:06:33,801 --> 00:06:36,042
You are not screwing up this wedding.
Do you hear me?

148
00:06:36,204 --> 00:06:38,947
Mom, do you hear this river of horse shit
coming out of Dad's mouth?

149
00:06:39,108 --> 00:06:42,146
We don't want you showing up stag
and riling each other up!

150
00:06:42,311 --> 00:06:44,723
- We don't rile each other up!
- We never get riled up!

151
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,019
- I don't get riled!
- He doesn't and I don't, either!

152
00:06:47,316 --> 00:06:48,886
Look at you right now! You're riled!

153
00:06:48,984 --> 00:06:51,191
- Take your head out of your ass, Dad!
- You sound insane right now.

154
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:53,857
Everybody stop yelling! Okay?

155
00:06:54,023 --> 00:06:56,230
You guys bringing wedding dates
was my idea.

156
00:06:57,793 --> 00:07:00,364
Look, I love the shit out of you guys.

157
00:07:00,662 --> 00:07:03,541
But everyone is already stressed out
about this wedding...

158
00:07:03,832 --> 00:07:06,574
and I just need you to be cool.

159
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:08,470
Of course, Jeanie!

160
00:07:08,704 --> 00:07:09,978
Please?

161
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:11,174
For me?

162
00:07:11,407 --> 00:07:13,751
I promise. We would never do anything
to mess up your wedding.

163
00:07:14,376 --> 00:07:15,582
Jeanie, we love you.

164
00:07:16,146 --> 00:07:17,400
We want this to be
the best day of your life.

165
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,468
Yeah.

166
00:07:18,548 --> 00:07:19,636
You, too, Eric.

167
00:07:19,716 --> 00:07:20,922
- Oh.
- Oh. Thank you.

168
00:07:21,217 --> 00:07:22,318
Mostly you, though, Jeanie.

169
00:07:23,353 --> 00:07:25,308
If you want us to bring dates,
we're bringing dates.

170
00:07:25,388 --> 00:07:26,458
All right, it's settled then.

171
00:07:27,924 --> 00:07:29,301
Wedding dates!

172
00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:32,196
Dave, buddy, let me talk to you
for a second, okay? Listen.

173
00:07:32,362 --> 00:07:34,433
I'm sorry to lump you in with Mike...

174
00:07:34,597 --> 00:07:36,270
but if I only told your older brother
to bring a date...

175
00:07:36,433 --> 00:07:38,037
he'd get all weird about it.

176
00:07:38,268 --> 00:07:40,339
I just feel like he's holding you back.

177
00:07:40,503 --> 00:07:42,039
Dad, I don't mind
being lumped in with Mike.

178
00:07:42,272 --> 00:07:43,615
Do you remember
the fifth grade bake sale...

179
00:07:43,773 --> 00:07:44,808
when Mom made those cupcakes...

180
00:07:45,075 --> 00:07:46,247
and I called them moist?

181
00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:48,719
- Mm-hmm.
- Everyone called me Moist...

182
00:07:48,878 --> 00:07:50,789
till Mike took a cupcake...

183
00:07:50,947 --> 00:07:53,587
and shoved it in Tom Ginty's face.

184
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:57,062
He said, "Now you're moist, Moist."

185
00:07:58,189 --> 00:08:00,294
That's the kind of guy Mike is.

186
00:08:00,558 --> 00:08:02,094
So, think on that...

187
00:08:03,027 --> 00:08:04,233
Dad.

188
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,635
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to end that
on such a weird note, Dad.

189
00:08:08,732 --> 00:08:10,803
- I love you. And thanks.
- Good. I don't want you to be mad.

190
00:08:10,901 --> 00:08:12,023
I'm not even mad. I'm not even upset.

191
00:08:12,103 --> 00:08:13,138
We're gonna find some dates.

192
00:08:14,271 --> 00:08:16,842
I gotta say, some nights,
I am not looking my best.

193
00:08:17,108 --> 00:08:20,054
But tonight is not one of those nights!

194
00:08:20,244 --> 00:08:21,450
- Do you like my hair?
- Yeah, girl.

195
00:08:21,612 --> 00:08:23,114
- You look good.
- No.

196
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,452
We're gonna make a lot of tips tonight.

197
00:08:24,715 --> 00:08:26,626
Good. We need it. We don't have any money.

198
00:08:26,951 --> 00:08:28,589
Uh, you got money for this ride, don't you?

199
00:08:29,086 --> 00:08:30,608
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

200
00:08:30,688 --> 00:08:32,576
- 'Cause you have money?
- I thought you had money.

201
00:08:32,656 --> 00:08:34,713
- I don't have any money.
- You know I don't have money.

202
00:08:34,793 --> 00:08:37,330
Yeah, y'all are whispering like people
that don't got money.

203
00:08:37,496 --> 00:08:38,941
Check it out. I'mma pay you right now.

204
00:08:39,397 --> 00:08:40,752
Boop. I Apple Paid.

205
00:08:40,832 --> 00:08:41,970
I don't even have Apple Pay.

206
00:08:42,267 --> 00:08:44,008
Yo, Siri, pay this man.

207
00:08:44,302 --> 00:08:45,290
He's already paid.

208
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:46,358
God damn it!

209
00:08:46,438 --> 00:08:48,850
I'm not gonna take shit from you,
because this my cab.

210
00:08:49,007 --> 00:08:50,429
You shouldn't take shit from us.

211
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:52,731
- You should kick us out!
- You should kick us out of this cab.

212
00:08:52,811 --> 00:08:55,901
You know what? I'm gonna kick you
the fuck out of this cab.

213
00:08:55,981 --> 00:08:58,203
Yeah, just go three more blocks up
on the right...

214
00:08:58,283 --> 00:08:59,318
and then kick us out!

215
00:09:00,584 --> 00:09:02,821
Here we are! Get out of my cab.

216
00:09:02,988 --> 00:09:04,296
Thank you. You're a really good person.

217
00:09:04,456 --> 00:09:05,491
Okay, God bless you.

218
00:09:05,657 --> 00:09:08,137
I'm just gonna start driving for Uber.
Fuck it.

219
00:09:08,593 --> 00:09:09,594
Ooh. I got a good idea.

220
00:09:09,761 --> 00:09:11,434
Let's pop off, get a couple of drinks
before work.

221
00:09:11,596 --> 00:09:13,668
Just a few,
because I don't want to get hammered.

222
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,335
Yeah, of course not. Just a light buzz.

223
00:09:21,941 --> 00:09:25,012
Hey, hey, hey! Welcome to Sake Bombers...

224
00:09:25,178 --> 00:09:27,385
where your first Sake Bomb is on us!

225
00:09:27,547 --> 00:09:29,458
- Kaboom!
- You're drunk, Alice.

226
00:09:29,682 --> 00:09:31,304
You're doing that thing
where you're whispering,

227
00:09:31,384 --> 00:09:32,522
but you're really yelling.

228
00:09:32,685 --> 00:09:33,993
Because I'm upset with you.

229
00:09:34,153 --> 00:09:35,188
Oh, what the hell?

230
00:09:35,354 --> 00:09:37,677
I don't understand why you just
started yelling at me for no reason.

231
00:09:37,757 --> 00:09:40,564
- What the hell is going on here?
- Your little buddy is shit-faced.

232
00:09:41,727 --> 00:09:45,506
Straight up.
Her fiancé just left her at the altar.

233
00:09:45,798 --> 00:09:46,786
She's been going through a hard time.

234
00:09:46,866 --> 00:09:48,955
- Are you guys talking about me?
- No, baby girl.

235
00:09:49,035 --> 00:09:50,514
You know how many times
I have come in here...

236
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:54,619
and she is drunk off her fucking ass,
dancing on the tables?

237
00:09:54,741 --> 00:09:57,915
Only when Rihanna comes on,
because it's my jam.

238
00:09:58,078 --> 00:09:59,819
I am a strong independent woman.

239
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,653
And I will get on a table
and shake my shit to RiRi.

240
00:10:03,817 --> 00:10:05,806
Because it's my right. America!

241
00:10:05,886 --> 00:10:06,887
Feminism!

242
00:10:07,054 --> 00:10:08,499
You just push your tits up
and say feminism?

243
00:10:08,655 --> 00:10:10,032
Yeah. Read a Twitter.

244
00:10:10,457 --> 00:10:13,400
# 2016. Women can do shit now.

245
00:10:16,096 --> 00:10:17,541
Don't do that!

246
00:10:17,698 --> 00:10:19,200
Who put her jam on?

247
00:10:19,499 --> 00:10:21,536
Queen RiRi, forever!

248
00:10:21,702 --> 00:10:23,613
I'm really sorry that I got us fired.

249
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,077
I'm just sort of surprised
it didn't happen sooner...

250
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,685
- but I'm still really sorry.
- Hey!

251
00:10:28,175 --> 00:10:31,088
Alice, you do not apologize
right now, okay?

252
00:10:31,178 --> 00:10:32,283
You didn't do one thing wrong.

253
00:10:32,513 --> 00:10:34,754
- Okay.
- People need to get in line with you.

254
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,953
Right. You're right.

255
00:10:37,118 --> 00:10:38,859
Alice, why are you watching
your wedding video?

256
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,509
And Alice... do you take Luke?

257
00:10:41,589 --> 00:10:42,610
I do.

258
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:45,566
Because it's therapeutic.
The more I watch it, the less I feel.

259
00:10:45,693 --> 00:10:46,763
And do you, Luke, take Alice?

260
00:10:46,961 --> 00:10:47,962
I do...

261
00:10:48,396 --> 00:10:49,397
not.

262
00:10:51,933 --> 00:10:53,139
Oh, man. Fuck you, Luke.

263
00:10:53,668 --> 00:10:54,942
Oh, fuck that guy.

264
00:10:55,203 --> 00:10:56,443
Fuck him right in his dick.

265
00:10:56,604 --> 00:10:57,639
No!

266
00:10:57,805 --> 00:11:01,582
Because now I'm picturing his dick
getting fucked by another dick.

267
00:11:01,743 --> 00:11:03,154
And it makes me want to protect it.

268
00:11:04,479 --> 00:11:06,959
Oh, my God, girl! Damn!

269
00:11:07,115 --> 00:11:08,788
You're better than this. Come on!

270
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,429
We're T and A!

271
00:11:10,585 --> 00:11:13,089
Where's the Alice who made
vodka pot brownies with me...

272
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:14,632
for the junior high science fair?

273
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,929
Or gave us water balloon tits and we won
that wet T-shirt contest in Mexico?

274
00:11:18,093 --> 00:11:20,232
Oh, yeah, they were so nice.

275
00:11:20,396 --> 00:11:22,069
I know, dude. We need that shit.

276
00:11:22,331 --> 00:11:23,901
I'm tired of living like this.

277
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,470
We need an adventure.

278
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:30,982
We've got a great little package
we're selling here, man.

279
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,416
A week in a tropical paradise...

280
00:11:33,575 --> 00:11:36,522
with two fun-loving,
yet surprisingly well-read bros?

281
00:11:36,645 --> 00:11:37,633
Yeah.

282
00:11:37,713 --> 00:11:39,468
I read most of the Goosebumps series,
and so did you.

283
00:11:39,548 --> 00:11:40,536
Yeah.

284
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:41,604
Where do I sign up?

285
00:11:41,684 --> 00:11:42,871
Dude, focus.

286
00:11:42,951 --> 00:11:44,692
- Okay.
- This is for Jeanie.

287
00:11:44,953 --> 00:11:48,457
So to find the perfect fun, but nice girls,
we're gonna have to meet a lot of them.

288
00:11:48,891 --> 00:11:49,892
The Internet!

289
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:51,127
That's a good idea.

290
00:11:51,361 --> 00:11:52,840
Match.com, Tinder...

291
00:11:52,996 --> 00:11:54,551
Grindr, OkCupid.

292
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:55,632
Craigslist!

293
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:56,853
Craigslist?

294
00:11:56,933 --> 00:11:59,038
Craigslist, you think,
that's where you go to meet nice girls?

295
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,307
Dave?

296
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,143
We met this couch on Craigslist.

297
00:12:03,006 --> 00:12:05,247
And you wuv this couch, don't you?

298
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,448
I do love that couch.

299
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:10,882
I'm gonna unlock the swag on this bitch.

300
00:12:11,214 --> 00:12:12,202
All right.

301
00:12:12,282 --> 00:12:14,922
Here you go. Just take a little sip.
Take a little nip-a-roo.

302
00:12:18,388 --> 00:12:19,389
Boom!

303
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:21,578
Do you think anyone's even really gonna
see this?

304
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:22,659
God, I hope so.

305
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,131
Like max, what do you think?

306
00:12:24,294 --> 00:12:26,968
We're gonna get, like, five or six dates
out of this, or what?

307
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:28,734
I'd be happy with that.

308
00:12:34,739 --> 00:12:35,760
Hey.

309
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,286
Did you see this thing
that Shelly's sending around the office?

310
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:40,580
It's a free trip to Hawaii!

311
00:12:40,745 --> 00:12:42,300
Look what someone posted to my Facebook.

312
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,690
- I gotta tweet this out.
- Those guys are cute.

313
00:12:44,849 --> 00:12:45,884
Ala-hat!

314
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:49,089
- I got the one on the right.
- I like the one on the right.

315
00:12:49,253 --> 00:12:50,241
Oh, I got the one on the right.

316
00:12:50,321 --> 00:12:52,562
I like the one on the right.

317
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:54,779
- We gotta send this to everyone.
- Let's all apply!

318
00:12:54,859 --> 00:12:56,981
- I want to go to Hawaii.
- I just emailed them.

319
00:12:57,061 --> 00:12:58,249
Let's just meet them, give 'em a chance.

320
00:12:58,329 --> 00:13:00,434
So, you guys want to go to a wedding?

321
00:13:02,066 --> 00:13:03,101
Uh, what are your names?

322
00:13:04,769 --> 00:13:05,770
Do you guys have names?

323
00:13:07,405 --> 00:13:10,285
Basically we were looking through
Craigslist for work.

324
00:13:10,942 --> 00:13:12,097
Oh, you're both...

325
00:13:12,177 --> 00:13:13,178
Prostitutes.

326
00:13:13,445 --> 00:13:14,966
Whatever. Take us to Hawaii!

327
00:13:15,046 --> 00:13:16,047
Hawaii!

328
00:13:19,184 --> 00:13:20,472
We can't take you.

329
00:13:20,552 --> 00:13:21,540
No way.

330
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,896
Did you guys say something about
an all-expenses-paid trip to Hawaii?

331
00:13:24,122 --> 00:13:25,260
It's just for girls.

332
00:13:25,624 --> 00:13:27,399
That's not a deal breaker.

333
00:13:27,626 --> 00:13:28,730
Hi, my name is Lauralie...

334
00:13:28,894 --> 00:13:30,182
and I'm kind of new to this.

335
00:13:30,262 --> 00:13:31,249
Yeah.

336
00:13:31,329 --> 00:13:32,467
You're new to...

337
00:13:32,764 --> 00:13:34,243
Online dating. Yeah.

338
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,777
I'm not really looking
for a heteronormative relationship.

339
00:13:36,902 --> 00:13:39,473
- You look like a Nike swoosh.
- Goddamn right, I do.

340
00:13:39,638 --> 00:13:40,639
I work at a dog shelter.

341
00:13:40,906 --> 00:13:42,283
Our sister loves dogs.

342
00:13:42,441 --> 00:13:43,595
I wanna make sure
they get really good homes.

343
00:13:43,675 --> 00:13:44,676
What's a good home?

344
00:13:45,243 --> 00:13:46,483
The white homes.

345
00:13:46,645 --> 00:13:48,592
- The what homes?
- The white homes.

346
00:13:48,748 --> 00:13:49,954
Like white people.

347
00:13:52,418 --> 00:13:53,954
Check, please.

348
00:13:54,253 --> 00:13:57,324
This isn't lipstick.
This is a tattoo, you dumb fuck.

349
00:13:58,324 --> 00:14:01,168
Who are you laughing at? Who?

350
00:14:01,427 --> 00:14:02,599
All right, look, here's the deal.

351
00:14:02,895 --> 00:14:05,102
I went through a divorce, like,
three weeks ago. I need a vacation.

352
00:14:05,398 --> 00:14:06,753
No.

353
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:07,834
Okay, you guys sure
you don't want to fuck?

354
00:14:07,934 --> 00:14:08,935
- What?
- Nothing.

355
00:14:09,068 --> 00:14:10,089
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

356
00:14:10,169 --> 00:14:12,458
Sounded like you said,
"Do you wanna fuck?"

357
00:14:12,538 --> 00:14:13,539
Do you wanna fuck?

358
00:14:13,673 --> 00:14:14,694
- What?
- What?

359
00:14:14,774 --> 00:14:16,082
- What?
- You guys...

360
00:14:16,242 --> 00:14:17,346
- Do you want me to fuck you?
- No.

361
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:18,989
- No.
- I didn't say it, but...

362
00:14:19,078 --> 00:14:21,217
- I'll suck your dick right now. What?
- What?

363
00:14:27,821 --> 00:14:31,162
Welcome back.
I'm here with Mike and Dave Stangle...

364
00:14:31,325 --> 00:14:32,998
who posted an ad on Craigslist...

365
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,901
looking for dates
for their sister's wedding...

366
00:14:35,162 --> 00:14:37,199
in Oahu, Hawaii.

367
00:14:37,364 --> 00:14:38,468
Well, the ad went viral.

368
00:14:38,632 --> 00:14:39,667
Mm-hmm.

369
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,211
It racked up over 6,000 responses...

370
00:14:42,369 --> 00:14:44,591
from women who actually wanted to go.

371
00:14:44,671 --> 00:14:45,672
Yeah, well, who's counting?

372
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,284
You know, I guess we all are.

373
00:14:47,508 --> 00:14:48,543
Is this my close-up?

374
00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:50,211
You guys, come on. Craigslist?

375
00:14:50,377 --> 00:14:52,789
Honestly, this is about
finding nice girls...

376
00:14:52,946 --> 00:14:55,290
to go with us to Hawaii
for our sister's wedding.

377
00:14:55,449 --> 00:14:56,621
And I just want to reiterate...

378
00:14:56,783 --> 00:14:59,263
we're footing the bill for this
because we're gentlemen.

379
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,209
- Free trip to Hawaii?
- I'm awake!

380
00:15:02,289 --> 00:15:03,563
- Come on. Craigslist.
- What's up?

381
00:15:03,724 --> 00:15:05,135
That's where you go
to buy old patio furniture.

382
00:15:05,292 --> 00:15:06,533
You know what else you can find
on Craigslist?

383
00:15:06,694 --> 00:15:07,729
Mm-hmm.

384
00:15:08,162 --> 00:15:09,505
- Love.
- Mm-mm.

385
00:15:09,664 --> 00:15:11,837
That's right. I said it.

386
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,673
- Love.
- That one seems sweet.

387
00:15:13,902 --> 00:15:15,973
He has a kind soul.

388
00:15:16,137 --> 00:15:18,139
Yeah, and he's also super hot.

389
00:15:20,008 --> 00:15:21,851
Yeah, he's hot as fucking balls.

390
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:24,422
But just to repeat,
we're looking for nice girls.

391
00:15:24,579 --> 00:15:27,856
Like, girls that our mom and our sister
would like.

392
00:15:28,016 --> 00:15:31,361
Okay, look, dude, we are going to Hawaii.

393
00:15:31,586 --> 00:15:32,963
Let's go on vacation.

394
00:15:33,254 --> 00:15:35,029
But it's not a vacation. It's a wedding.

395
00:15:35,323 --> 00:15:37,599
Do you really think a wedding's
the best place for me?

396
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,036
Since the last wedding I went to
was mine...

397
00:15:41,195 --> 00:15:42,684
and it didn't turn out very well.

398
00:15:42,764 --> 00:15:43,765
I hear you, but look...

399
00:15:43,998 --> 00:15:46,445
this shit is why this shit
is perfect, okay?

400
00:15:46,602 --> 00:15:48,775
Because ever since Luke left,
you haven't been the same.

401
00:15:49,071 --> 00:15:51,517
You need to get over that,
once and for all.

402
00:15:51,674 --> 00:15:52,778
And this our shot, man.

403
00:15:53,075 --> 00:15:55,055
That dude,
he's gonna get your groove back.

404
00:15:55,277 --> 00:15:58,281
This right here is an opportunity
of a lifetime...

405
00:15:58,447 --> 00:16:00,620
and you know we are entrepreneurs.

406
00:16:00,783 --> 00:16:01,784
You know what?

407
00:16:01,951 --> 00:16:04,192
Let's make these guys take us to Hawaii!

408
00:16:04,353 --> 00:16:06,026
You're right! Let's do it!

409
00:16:06,188 --> 00:16:07,176
Let's just do it!

410
00:16:07,256 --> 00:16:08,291
- Yes, bitch.
- Let's fucking do it!

411
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:10,579
We'll be right back.

412
00:16:10,659 --> 00:16:13,873
We gonna go to Hawaii!
We gonna go to Hawaii!

413
00:16:15,598 --> 00:16:16,599
Whoa! Whoa!

414
00:16:16,732 --> 00:16:17,904
- Hold up!
- What?

415
00:16:19,301 --> 00:16:22,578
Those boys said they wanted nice girls.
We don't look like nice girls.

416
00:16:23,572 --> 00:16:25,484
Yeah, I guess
I haven't showered in a while.

417
00:16:25,775 --> 00:16:27,618
Fine, well, you know what we're gonna do?

418
00:16:28,945 --> 00:16:31,585
We're gonna look respectable as fuck.

419
00:16:31,881 --> 00:16:33,087
Like nice girls.

420
00:16:35,151 --> 00:16:36,459
Ugh.

421
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,691
Dude, it's like that Jesus rag!

422
00:16:39,756 --> 00:16:41,326
Ow! It's part of me.

423
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:44,105
Tatiana, your underwear
needs more underwears.

424
00:16:45,562 --> 00:16:46,563
Whoa!

425
00:16:48,999 --> 00:16:50,945
Oh, this dress is my bitch!

426
00:16:53,603 --> 00:16:55,605
Dude, we have met 37 insane women.

427
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,148
We can't bring any of these girls.

428
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:00,345
Maybe Dad'll just forget about
his ultimatum.

429
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:03,457
Why would Dad forget about an old tomato?

430
00:17:04,015 --> 00:17:05,653
No, his ultimatum.

431
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:06,988
- Old tom...
- Ultimatum.

432
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,186
Are you saying "old tomato"?

433
00:17:08,452 --> 00:17:11,075
Ultima-tomb. Like a tomb or a crypt.

434
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,190
Ultimatum.

435
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:15,566
Well, we gotta figure something out,
because the wedding's coming up quick.

436
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,206
Why is everything a competition with you?

437
00:17:27,438 --> 00:17:29,714
And I said that first, so actually,
I won that.

438
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,716
So what time are we meeting them?

439
00:17:33,878 --> 00:17:35,653
Technically, no time.

440
00:17:37,114 --> 00:17:39,185
Yeah, because I was thinking about
emailing them...

441
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,954
but then I was thinking, um...

442
00:17:41,118 --> 00:17:43,998
what kind of floozy-ass bimbo
would respond to that ad?

443
00:17:44,356 --> 00:17:45,391
Um...

444
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:46,491
Us.

445
00:17:46,658 --> 00:17:49,138
Yeah, but we're not like those idiots.
You know what I'm saying?

446
00:17:49,294 --> 00:17:52,104
Because they're all like,
"Oh! Pick me, pick me!"

447
00:17:52,397 --> 00:17:54,399
it's like the guys interviewing the girls.

448
00:17:54,566 --> 00:17:57,069
Like, it immediately would put us
in an inferior position.

449
00:17:57,235 --> 00:17:59,237
We're gonna flip the script
and Bachelorette that shit.

450
00:17:59,504 --> 00:18:01,677
- Those guys would be lucky to have us.
- Right.

451
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,911
- We just gotta make them think so.
- Okay, right.

452
00:18:04,009 --> 00:18:06,182
But, you know,
I'm really not good at lying...

453
00:18:06,278 --> 00:18:08,600
because I always try to start small
and then it gets crazy...

454
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,388
and I make-up stuff
that couldn't possibly be true.

455
00:18:11,683 --> 00:18:14,306
Baby, you can do this.
Let's practice, okay?

456
00:18:14,386 --> 00:18:15,374
Okay.

457
00:18:15,454 --> 00:18:16,524
- Um, what do you like to do?
- Drink.

458
00:18:17,589 --> 00:18:18,829
Just sweet teas.

459
00:18:19,091 --> 00:18:21,071
Sweet teas and biscuits on blimps.

460
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:23,366
All right, straight up,
you don't have to do an accent.

461
00:18:23,529 --> 00:18:24,564
I was doing an accent?

462
00:18:24,731 --> 00:18:25,801
And definitely don't bring up blimps.

463
00:18:26,065 --> 00:18:27,373
Shit! They're leaving.

464
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,840
If it was a competition, I won it.

465
00:18:29,102 --> 00:18:31,173
All right, don't worry.

466
00:18:31,337 --> 00:18:32,338
It's all part of the plan.

467
00:18:32,505 --> 00:18:33,609
- Is it?
- Oh, yeah.

468
00:18:33,773 --> 00:18:36,253
What does that mean? What plan?
I don't know this part of the plan...

469
00:18:36,342 --> 00:18:37,343
Whoa! Ahh!

470
00:18:37,844 --> 00:18:39,645
Oh, fuck!

471
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,535
Tatiana! Oh!

472
00:18:42,615 --> 00:18:43,616
Holy shit.

473
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:44,851
Babe. Are you okay?

474
00:18:45,084 --> 00:18:46,927
I'm okay. Yell, "She can't breathe!"

475
00:18:47,086 --> 00:18:48,190
She can't breathe!

476
00:18:48,354 --> 00:18:49,742
She can't breathe! Somebody help her!

477
00:18:49,822 --> 00:18:50,823
Somebody give her CPR!

478
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,626
- She can't breathe!
- I know CPR!

479
00:18:52,792 --> 00:18:54,237
- Great!
- I was a volunteer EMT!

480
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,768
Hey, don't worry.
My brother's got this, okay?

481
00:18:55,962 --> 00:18:57,498
I took a class. I know what I'm doing.

482
00:18:57,764 --> 00:18:58,765
- She has a weak heart!
- Ma'am?

483
00:18:59,031 --> 00:19:00,203
- Ma'am?
- She has a weak heart.

484
00:19:00,366 --> 00:19:02,506
I'm an EMT. I'm like a doctor, basically.

485
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:05,410
I'm here to save your fucking life, okay?

486
00:19:05,572 --> 00:19:07,813
- She's my only friend!
- That's her only friend, Mike!

487
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:09,163
We got a pulse! Okay.

488
00:19:09,243 --> 00:19:10,464
Don't let her die!

489
00:19:10,544 --> 00:19:12,285
Don't you fucking let her die, Mike!

490
00:19:12,446 --> 00:19:14,483
Just shut the fuck up, Dave!
You, too, shut up!

491
00:19:14,782 --> 00:19:16,386
Both of you, shut up! Okay?

492
00:19:16,483 --> 00:19:17,484
I'm gonna save her life!

493
00:19:20,587 --> 00:19:22,188
Plug the nose.

494
00:19:25,325 --> 00:19:26,326
Oh!

495
00:19:27,394 --> 00:19:28,873
Are you okay?

496
00:19:29,496 --> 00:19:31,336
I am now.

497
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:34,101
- I saved her life!
- She's okay!

498
00:19:34,268 --> 00:19:35,747
- She's okay?
- I saved her life!

499
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:38,472
Thank you! Thank you!

500
00:19:38,639 --> 00:19:40,984
- You're under arrest.
- She hit my car!

501
00:19:41,142 --> 00:19:42,397
No, you guys, I'm totally fine, really.

502
00:19:42,477 --> 00:19:43,615
It happens all the time.

503
00:19:43,778 --> 00:19:46,190
That was a vicious hit.
We should take you to the hospital.

504
00:19:46,347 --> 00:19:48,190
It's crazy.
It's almost like I owe you my life.

505
00:19:49,117 --> 00:19:50,926
- Almost.
- Yeah. Technically, yeah.

506
00:19:51,085 --> 00:19:53,156
- Let me help you with that ice.
- I do.

507
00:19:53,354 --> 00:19:54,375
Oh, no.

508
00:19:54,455 --> 00:19:56,162
Seems like it's going pretty well
with your guy.

509
00:19:56,324 --> 00:19:59,580
Dude, I'm fucking crushing it! So hard!

510
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:03,605
Check this out. The kids in my class
are gonna love this story.

511
00:20:03,765 --> 00:20:05,369
I'm a school teacher.

512
00:20:07,268 --> 00:20:09,612
You're a school teacher? Wow.

513
00:20:09,771 --> 00:20:12,513
Oop. I think they spelt "frittata"
wrong on the menu.

514
00:20:12,674 --> 00:20:14,381
I always notice words and spelling...

515
00:20:14,542 --> 00:20:16,215
because I'm a teacher...

516
00:20:16,978 --> 00:20:18,218
and that's what I do.

517
00:20:19,146 --> 00:20:22,518
- That's...
- So, Alice, um, what do you do?

518
00:20:23,352 --> 00:20:24,490
Manage a hedge fund.

519
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,958
You manage a hedge fund?

520
00:20:26,121 --> 00:20:28,226
I don't even know what a hedge fund is.

521
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:30,893
Oh. So there's a regular fund,
and then there's a hedge fund.

522
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:33,131
And our fund...

523
00:20:33,963 --> 00:20:35,033
Uh, we hedge it.

524
00:20:35,531 --> 00:20:36,532
We hedge it hard.

525
00:20:36,699 --> 00:20:37,700
Oh, wow.

526
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,004
I get in, in the morning, and I'm like...

527
00:20:40,169 --> 00:20:42,979
"How's the hedging coming?
You been hedging? You hedged much?"

528
00:20:43,239 --> 00:20:45,446
And it's like, too big to fail.

529
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:47,585
Corporate greed, bailouts.

530
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,848
In a New York minute,
everything can change.

531
00:20:50,145 --> 00:20:53,024
On the floor of the NASDAQ and the U.N.

532
00:20:53,249 --> 00:20:54,387
And then, Fannie Mae.

533
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:57,394
Bernie Mac and D.L. Hughley...

534
00:20:57,553 --> 00:20:58,726
- Alice, you want some water?
- Yeah.

535
00:20:59,022 --> 00:21:00,797
- That's so smart.
- That is.

536
00:21:01,091 --> 00:21:02,813
"But what I do have...

537
00:21:02,893 --> 00:21:05,081
"is a particular set of skills.

538
00:21:05,161 --> 00:21:07,732
"Skills I have acquired
over a very long career.

539
00:21:08,031 --> 00:21:10,875
"Skills that make me a nightmare
for people like you."

540
00:21:12,669 --> 00:21:13,739
Click. That's it.

541
00:21:14,004 --> 00:21:15,091
That was amazing.

542
00:21:15,171 --> 00:21:16,616
It was like Dave was not even here...

543
00:21:16,773 --> 00:21:18,684
and I was just standing in a bar
with Liam Neeson.

544
00:21:18,842 --> 00:21:20,287
Like, "Hello, Liam Neeson's over here."

545
00:21:20,577 --> 00:21:22,955
You're a professional comedian
or something?

546
00:21:23,113 --> 00:21:25,923
What? No. I sell liquor with my brother.

547
00:21:26,082 --> 00:21:27,083
- Oh.
- Yeah.

548
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:29,057
- I do like to draw.
- Oh, yeah?

549
00:21:29,219 --> 00:21:30,698
Yeah, I have drawings here
I could show you.

550
00:21:31,521 --> 00:21:32,625
Oh, shit, not that. Sorry.

551
00:21:32,789 --> 00:21:34,928
Here. So, they're like The Avengers...

552
00:21:35,091 --> 00:21:36,798
but they're different types of alcohol.

553
00:21:37,093 --> 00:21:40,132
So, you have Tequila,
and then he's got his pet worm right there.

554
00:21:40,431 --> 00:21:42,206
And his name is Lil' Mez.

555
00:21:42,533 --> 00:21:43,978
Because he'll "Mez" you up.

556
00:21:44,135 --> 00:21:45,823
The next one right there, that's Gin.

557
00:21:45,903 --> 00:21:48,059
When he flips his cap off,
dawg, he's just like...

558
00:21:48,139 --> 00:21:51,086
"Yo, I'll pop you off. Guaranteed.
One knock."

559
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:54,055
Done. Next, Whiskey.

560
00:21:54,178 --> 00:21:56,917
Likes to make moonshine and kill bad guys.

561
00:21:57,081 --> 00:21:58,936
Dude, this is objectively amazing.

562
00:21:59,016 --> 00:22:00,154
Thanks.

563
00:22:00,284 --> 00:22:02,594
What's the hardest thing
about being a teacher?

564
00:22:03,254 --> 00:22:04,255
I don't know.

565
00:22:06,424 --> 00:22:07,459
Oh, um...

566
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:10,514
The hardest thing about being a teacher...

567
00:22:10,594 --> 00:22:11,698
is teaching cursive.

568
00:22:11,996 --> 00:22:13,270
That's awesome.

569
00:22:13,431 --> 00:22:15,172
- What about you?
- Yeah?

570
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:17,109
- Are you seeing anyone?
- No.

571
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:19,591
My ex is gone. Long gone.

572
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:20,672
What do you mean?

573
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:22,683
He died. Of cancer.

574
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:23,976
Oh, my God.

575
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:25,143
And AIDS.

576
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:26,611
He died twice?

577
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:29,289
And then he died in a plane crash, so...

578
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,759
Whoo! That's a lot to take in.

579
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:33,863
I know!

580
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:35,421
Thank you.

581
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:37,089
Thank you, brotha.

582
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:40,432
Dude.

583
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:43,368
We should take these girls
to the wedding. Right?

584
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,269
Mine's a sexy school teacher...

585
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,774
and yours... hedges funds.

586
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:49,310
- Just keep doing sexy eyes.
- Okay.

587
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:50,879
Keep doing sexy eyes.

588
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,944
I like Alice.

589
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:55,483
And she's smart, she's funny, she's weird.

590
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:58,654
We invite these girls to the wedding,
suddenly we're not losers.

591
00:22:58,811 --> 00:23:00,313
We're winners!

592
00:23:02,782 --> 00:23:03,817
Here they come. They're coming.

593
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,791
Hey, uh, this might sound crazy...

594
00:23:05,952 --> 00:23:08,523
but our little sister is getting married
in Hawaii...

595
00:23:08,821 --> 00:23:12,792
and we wanted to know
if you guys wanted to come with.

596
00:23:12,992 --> 00:23:14,528
- Um...
- Um...

597
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:16,732
Can you just give us a second to...

598
00:23:17,296 --> 00:23:18,536
Of course.

599
00:23:18,698 --> 00:23:21,645
Okay, so just whisper
like we're talking it over...

600
00:23:21,801 --> 00:23:22,889
like we're not sure if we wanna go or not.

601
00:23:22,969 --> 00:23:23,970
Oh, like...

602
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:30,812
What the fuck are you doing?

603
00:23:30,977 --> 00:23:32,498
I don't understand why we're arguing!

604
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:33,750
I thought we wanted to go.

605
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:36,154
All right, fuck it. Let's go to Hawaii!

606
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:38,693
- Yes! Fuck yes!
- Hawaii!

607
00:23:41,388 --> 00:23:42,543
Yo, what you know about goin' out?

608
00:23:42,623 --> 00:23:44,845
Head west, red Lex
TV's all up in the headrest

609
00:23:44,925 --> 00:23:47,181
Try and live it up, ride true, a bigger truck

610
00:23:47,261 --> 00:23:49,764
Peeps all glittered up
Stick up can, they go what?

611
00:23:49,863 --> 00:23:51,719
Jig wit it 'cuz ship crisp, split it all

612
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:53,972
Ho's ride, get your nut 'til I can't get it up

613
00:23:54,134 --> 00:23:57,274
Bad, bad, bad, bad boy

614
00:23:57,371 --> 00:23:58,692
You make me feel so good

615
00:23:58,772 --> 00:23:59,773
Aloha, and welcome.

616
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:00,941
- Hi.
- Aloha.

617
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:02,162
For real?

618
00:24:02,242 --> 00:24:03,778
Let me get you gentlemen checked in, yeah?

619
00:24:05,112 --> 00:24:07,956
Holy shit, this place is nice!

620
00:24:09,116 --> 00:24:11,221
It's gonna be more nice.

621
00:24:11,385 --> 00:24:13,626
Nice girls don't show off their ecstasy.

622
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:15,096
One of these is a multivitamin.

623
00:24:15,256 --> 00:24:16,257
Is this shit free?

624
00:24:16,424 --> 00:24:19,132
I can smoke weed out of this,
I can smoke weed out of this...

625
00:24:19,327 --> 00:24:22,467
Look at that teacher,
grabbing her apple a day.

626
00:24:22,897 --> 00:24:25,741
Look at that personality from behind.

627
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,846
It is, dare I say...

628
00:24:28,002 --> 00:24:29,481
- well-rounded.
- Mmm-hmm.

629
00:24:29,571 --> 00:24:30,572
Look at Mike.

630
00:24:30,738 --> 00:24:32,911
He looks like a funhouse mirror version
of a better looking dude...

631
00:24:33,942 --> 00:24:35,216
but he is just that dude.

632
00:24:36,411 --> 00:24:38,548
Dave, it is so on this weekend.

633
00:24:38,913 --> 00:24:40,991
I am not touching this guy
the whole weekend.

634
00:24:41,149 --> 00:24:43,438
He thinks just because he brought me here
I'm gonna sleep with him?

635
00:24:43,518 --> 00:24:44,519
Check it out.

636
00:24:44,619 --> 00:24:46,775
If this was Mike's dick, I'd be like...

637
00:24:46,855 --> 00:24:48,664
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo...

638
00:24:48,756 --> 00:24:50,258
I'd get close, but I'd never touch it.

639
00:24:50,992 --> 00:24:53,268
They have such beautiful flowers here.

640
00:24:53,429 --> 00:24:55,818
She's throwing out
serious vibes right now.

641
00:24:55,898 --> 00:24:57,053
I'm like, I'm hungry.

642
00:24:57,133 --> 00:24:58,339
I'm gonna butter them biscuits.

643
00:24:58,601 --> 00:25:00,274
I'm gonna baste them ham hocks.

644
00:25:00,436 --> 00:25:01,847
I'm gonna be like a sex chef.

645
00:25:02,104 --> 00:25:03,947
Mr. Grey will see you now.

646
00:25:04,306 --> 00:25:05,478
I'm gonna touch Dave.

647
00:25:05,641 --> 00:25:07,018
Every time he says something sweet...

648
00:25:07,176 --> 00:25:10,214
I wanna get some rope and chain
in bulk from Home Depot...

649
00:25:10,379 --> 00:25:12,290
and just see where it takes us, you know?

650
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:14,223
That is messed up.

651
00:25:14,783 --> 00:25:16,626
Ladies, your wedding itineraries.

652
00:25:16,785 --> 00:25:18,240
# DoingItForJeanie.

653
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,197
Today, we have the meet
and greet by the pool.

654
00:25:20,322 --> 00:25:22,311
And then after that,
we have a dolphin excursion.

655
00:25:22,391 --> 00:25:23,879
Friday is the rehearsal dinner.

656
00:25:23,959 --> 00:25:25,047
Mmm-hmm.

657
00:25:25,127 --> 00:25:27,649
That's where Dave and I are gonna be
doing our big speech.

658
00:25:27,729 --> 00:25:29,366
Will there be any downtime?

659
00:25:29,532 --> 00:25:31,205
Yeah, 'cause I gotta keep
in touch with the office.

660
00:25:31,367 --> 00:25:33,557
I gotta call my stocks
about the state of my bonds.

661
00:25:33,637 --> 00:25:34,638
It happens a lot.

662
00:25:34,905 --> 00:25:37,351
Mm-kay, I think we are right up here.

663
00:25:38,074 --> 00:25:40,850
Great. So which one
is me and Alice's room?

664
00:25:42,345 --> 00:25:43,467
Uh...

665
00:25:43,547 --> 00:25:46,892
I don't know.
Are you and Alice gonna share a room?

666
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:49,339
Or I was thinking that maybe you and I...

667
00:25:49,419 --> 00:25:51,160
would stay in the same room.

668
00:25:53,056 --> 00:25:56,162
That sounds interesting...

669
00:25:56,326 --> 00:25:58,328
but I don't think it would be a good idea.

670
00:25:59,663 --> 00:26:00,664
Why not?

671
00:26:03,233 --> 00:26:05,736
Because I don't trust myself around you.

672
00:26:06,403 --> 00:26:07,677
You can trust me.

673
00:26:07,837 --> 00:26:10,078
I do trust you.

674
00:26:10,874 --> 00:26:12,183
Let's trust each other.

675
00:26:12,343 --> 00:26:15,415
There's so much trust.

676
00:26:15,646 --> 00:26:17,956
Sorry. I didn't mean to do that.

677
00:26:18,049 --> 00:26:20,204
I respect you so much,
I can't wait to get you alone.

678
00:26:20,284 --> 00:26:22,540
Yeah, we're gonna cover
all the room charges and stuff...

679
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,108
for up to $50 per day.

680
00:26:24,188 --> 00:26:25,292
Oh, my God. You don't have to do that.

681
00:26:25,456 --> 00:26:27,561
I'm a very strict teacher.

682
00:26:27,758 --> 00:26:31,535
You be Michelle Pfeiffer
from Dangerous Minds, and I'll be...

683
00:26:31,696 --> 00:26:32,970
I'll be Coolio.

684
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:35,076
- Coolio's not in that movie.
- Oh.

685
00:26:36,467 --> 00:26:39,277
He is in song and spirit.

686
00:26:39,503 --> 00:26:42,177
I'm gonna call
a parent-teacher conference...

687
00:26:42,273 --> 00:26:45,049
and tell them what a bad boy you are.

688
00:26:45,209 --> 00:26:46,483
Please don't tell my mommy.

689
00:26:46,744 --> 00:26:48,065
Please don't tell my daddy.

690
00:26:48,145 --> 00:26:50,134
I think Wi-Fi is included, too, so...

691
00:26:50,214 --> 00:26:51,421
- That's always nice. Yeah.
- Yeah.

692
00:26:51,683 --> 00:26:55,674
If I were to give you a grade,
I'd give you a D.

693
00:26:55,754 --> 00:26:56,960
A big, hard D.

694
00:26:57,189 --> 00:26:58,497
Why? I deserve an A.

695
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:00,092
- What are you talking about?
- Oh.

696
00:27:00,259 --> 00:27:01,294
Nothing.

697
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,803
In conclusion...

698
00:27:02,961 --> 00:27:05,339
I'm gonna stay in the room...

699
00:27:05,497 --> 00:27:06,567
with Alice.

700
00:27:07,666 --> 00:27:09,668
That one, with Alice.

701
00:27:09,835 --> 00:27:11,178
Cool, cool. No doubt.

702
00:27:13,672 --> 00:27:16,744
Somebody overcooked the soft pretzel.

703
00:27:17,976 --> 00:27:20,199
My dick is hard. That's what I'm saying.
Give me five minutes.

704
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:22,816
Oh, my God. Ew!

705
00:27:23,348 --> 00:27:25,021
Lift it, drop it, shake it

706
00:27:25,117 --> 00:27:27,757
It's going down for real

707
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:34,168
It's going down for real

708
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:37,106
Grandma, I'd like you to meet Alice.

709
00:27:37,263 --> 00:27:39,953
She's super smart, great conversationalist,
and she works on Wall Street.

710
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:42,945
- But I'm one of the good ones.
- I think she is.

711
00:27:45,672 --> 00:27:46,878
I am a teacher, yeah.

712
00:27:47,106 --> 00:27:49,814
And you know what?
The key to teaching children is repetition.

713
00:27:49,976 --> 00:27:51,887
You'd be surprised how stupid they are.

714
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:02,722
Jeanie!

715
00:28:05,291 --> 00:28:07,066
- Hey, you!
- Hi! Hi!

716
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,064
I'm so proud
to introduce our wedding dates...

717
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,868
- Tatiana.
- And Alice.

718
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,406
Hi!

719
00:28:15,369 --> 00:28:17,474
- Oh, the bride. The gorgeous bride.
- Ow! Hi.

720
00:28:17,671 --> 00:28:21,346
This weekend is all about you
being happy and not shattered.

721
00:28:21,475 --> 00:28:23,631
- Oh. Thank you.
- Yeah.

722
00:28:23,711 --> 00:28:25,884
Check out your arms.
You got some Michelle Obama arms.

723
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,589
How'd you get those guns
on the plane, girl?

724
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,925
Eric... you are two points hotter
just being next to this woman.

725
00:28:33,487 --> 00:28:34,642
Try 10 points hotter.

726
00:28:34,722 --> 00:28:36,810
- Try a million.
- That's too many points.

727
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:39,013
- Wow, and Jeanie, nice snag.
- Thank you.

728
00:28:39,093 --> 00:28:40,595
You guys look great together, really.

729
00:28:40,794 --> 00:28:44,171
I'm liking this. Huh? Maybe you two
will keep these two in check a little bit.

730
00:28:44,831 --> 00:28:47,574
I think we can.
I'll just keep him on a leash.

731
00:28:47,735 --> 00:28:49,491
Maybe don't hurt him.

732
00:28:49,571 --> 00:28:51,050
I like these girls.

733
00:28:51,206 --> 00:28:52,276
They're so fun.

734
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,545
Unlike my maid of honor.

735
00:28:54,743 --> 00:28:55,813
She's having a time.

736
00:28:55,944 --> 00:28:57,048
How is ol' Becky Grammerstein?

737
00:28:57,245 --> 00:28:58,246
She's coming.

738
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,688
- Jeanie.
- Hey.

739
00:28:59,848 --> 00:29:01,225
I'm in crisis mode.

740
00:29:01,383 --> 00:29:03,021
I ordered Prosecco for the Mani-pedis...

741
00:29:03,184 --> 00:29:04,288
and all they have is champagne!

742
00:29:04,452 --> 00:29:05,453
Aren't they the same thing?

743
00:29:05,687 --> 00:29:08,099
- No. No, they're not. No.
- No?

744
00:29:08,723 --> 00:29:10,396
Hello, Michael.

745
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:11,559
Hi, Dave.

746
00:29:12,026 --> 00:29:15,530
Look, I'm trying to make your dreams
come true, okay?

747
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:16,765
- Right.
- What?

748
00:29:16,898 --> 00:29:18,720
If this is bad news,
I'm gonna eat your ass.

749
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,854
- Sorry.
- Okay.

750
00:29:19,934 --> 00:29:21,880
Purple. It better be purple.

751
00:29:22,303 --> 00:29:24,283
I should probably go see to that.

752
00:29:24,439 --> 00:29:25,440
- You'll come?
- Yeah.

753
00:29:25,607 --> 00:29:26,881
Thank you so much for being here.

754
00:29:27,041 --> 00:29:29,989
Guys, good job with these two.

755
00:29:30,146 --> 00:29:31,625
Mahala.

756
00:29:31,814 --> 00:29:33,054
Bye, Jeanie.

757
00:29:33,215 --> 00:29:34,216
Jeanie likes the girls.

758
00:29:34,383 --> 00:29:35,589
Jeanie likes the girls

759
00:29:35,785 --> 00:29:37,287
Talk about Jeanie Jeanie likes the girls

760
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:39,208
Because it's a" about
Jeanie likes the girls

761
00:29:39,288 --> 00:29:41,393
- Oil, yeah, Jeanie likes the girls
- Come on!

762
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:42,945
- It's a" about Jeanie
- Likes the girls

763
00:29:43,025 --> 00:29:45,848
- it's all about Jeanie likes the girls!
- Mike. Where are the girls?

764
00:29:45,928 --> 00:29:47,134
- Oh, hello!
- I'm Alice.

765
00:29:47,363 --> 00:29:48,484
I just I wanna give you a hug.

766
00:29:48,564 --> 00:29:50,009
It's so nice to meet you.

767
00:29:50,166 --> 00:29:51,440
Fucking A. You distracted me, man.

768
00:29:51,634 --> 00:29:53,636
This dress is lucky to be on you.
Those pins!

769
00:29:53,769 --> 00:29:54,839
- My Mike?
- Yes.

770
00:29:55,004 --> 00:29:56,176
- I can't... Wow.
- He did.

771
00:29:56,338 --> 00:29:58,011
That's fantastic.

772
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,878
Mike, Tatiana was just telling me...

773
00:29:59,975 --> 00:30:01,420
that you saved her life.

774
00:30:01,577 --> 00:30:02,851
I most certainly did, Father.

775
00:30:03,078 --> 00:30:05,801
You see how great it is
to have nice girls around?

776
00:30:05,881 --> 00:30:07,137
- I mean, these are nice girls.
- Aw!

777
00:30:07,217 --> 00:30:08,355
Absolutely.

778
00:30:08,485 --> 00:30:09,606
They are. And we brought them, so...

779
00:30:09,686 --> 00:30:10,960
Excuse me.

780
00:30:11,154 --> 00:30:12,142
Excuse me.

781
00:30:12,222 --> 00:30:13,210
See you in a minute. Honey, come on.

782
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:15,445
Can I get everybody's attention?
Could we gather around?

783
00:30:15,525 --> 00:30:16,902
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God!

784
00:30:17,027 --> 00:30:18,802
We're killing this shit! We're killing.

785
00:30:18,962 --> 00:30:20,117
Mom and Dad like the girls!

786
00:30:20,197 --> 00:30:21,284
Ow.

787
00:30:21,364 --> 00:30:22,775
Mom and Dad like the girls

788
00:30:22,933 --> 00:30:27,439
Hi, I'm Keith.
I'm Eric's best man, his cousin...

789
00:30:27,604 --> 00:30:29,606
and his best friend.

790
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,285
Welcome to the meet and greet!

791
00:30:32,676 --> 00:30:33,984
Yeah!

792
00:30:34,211 --> 00:30:35,315
Put your hands together...

793
00:30:35,479 --> 00:30:38,602
for Eric and his lovely bride, Jeanie.

794
00:30:38,682 --> 00:30:40,355
Give it up!

795
00:30:40,484 --> 00:30:41,656
Jeanie!

796
00:30:41,818 --> 00:30:45,288
Hey, everybody. A big thank you
to my new family, the Stangles.

797
00:30:45,489 --> 00:30:46,544
We love you, Eric!

798
00:30:46,624 --> 00:30:47,645
Thank you.

799
00:30:47,725 --> 00:30:49,864
And to my own family, I must say...

800
00:30:50,862 --> 00:30:52,535
Portland, Oregon in the house!

801
00:30:53,998 --> 00:30:56,979
I'm really happy
to finally make you all my ohana...

802
00:30:57,134 --> 00:30:58,511
which means "family."

803
00:30:58,669 --> 00:31:00,706
And as the Hawaiians say...

804
00:31:00,872 --> 00:31:02,078
Kale maluna!

805
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,312
Which translates loosely
into "bottoms up."

806
00:31:05,476 --> 00:31:08,184
But more closely translated,
it actually means...

807
00:31:08,412 --> 00:31:10,802
"your butts to the sky"...

808
00:31:10,882 --> 00:31:12,486
which is inappropriate.

809
00:31:13,818 --> 00:31:15,354
This is gonna be magic.

810
00:31:15,987 --> 00:31:19,230
Thank you all again,
so much, for being here.

811
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:23,065
We are so happy
to have you at our wedding.

812
00:31:23,594 --> 00:31:27,372
Wedding. Wedding. Wedding.

813
00:31:27,933 --> 00:31:29,571
- Put the mic on the stand.
- The stand.

814
00:31:30,903 --> 00:31:33,025
- Alice.
- Where are you going?

815
00:31:33,105 --> 00:31:34,092
Hi! What happened?

816
00:31:34,172 --> 00:31:36,243
You sort of zoned out for a sec.
What's up? You okay?

817
00:31:36,408 --> 00:31:38,786
Yeah! We're at a wedding.
Wedding. Wedding.

818
00:31:39,177 --> 00:31:40,699
You just said "wedding" three times.

819
00:31:40,779 --> 00:31:41,867
I'm fine. Yeah!

820
00:31:41,947 --> 00:31:43,722
Let's just forget about the past,
and move on.

821
00:31:44,016 --> 00:31:45,620
To the bar!

822
00:31:45,717 --> 00:31:46,991
To the bar?

823
00:31:47,953 --> 00:31:48,954
Mmm. Mmm.

824
00:31:51,423 --> 00:31:52,868
Ooh. I don't think these are shots.

825
00:31:53,025 --> 00:31:54,595
I mean, we're drinking 'em
like they're shots...

826
00:31:54,693 --> 00:31:56,934
but I don't think they're
supposed to be drunk like that.

827
00:31:57,095 --> 00:31:59,041
Your face is funny.

828
00:32:15,882 --> 00:32:19,439
Oh. Hey, Mike. I was just talking
to my new friend, Tatiana.

829
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:23,094
- Tatiana, this is my cousin, Mike.
- She knows who I am. She's my date.

830
00:32:23,289 --> 00:32:25,997
Why would someone this attractive
ever be with you?

831
00:32:26,292 --> 00:32:28,599
Are you gonna hit on my date all weekend,
like bisexual Fonzie?

832
00:32:28,728 --> 00:32:30,639
I don't think it's gonna take all weekend.
Am I right?

833
00:32:31,097 --> 00:32:32,337
So, you guys are cousins?

834
00:32:32,498 --> 00:32:34,239
She's been jealous of me
since I was a little kid.

835
00:32:34,434 --> 00:32:35,845
What could I possibly be jealous of?

836
00:32:35,969 --> 00:32:38,245
Your outfit looks like Jimmy Buffet's
dust ruffle.

837
00:32:38,504 --> 00:32:40,677
Do you guys always do this?

838
00:32:40,907 --> 00:32:42,614
Okay, this is actually
a very fashion-forward outfit.

839
00:32:42,775 --> 00:32:45,256
No, you look like the wallpaper
from a Long John Silver's bathroom.

840
00:32:45,446 --> 00:32:47,016
Cool. I'm gonna hit the buffet now...

841
00:32:47,181 --> 00:32:50,822
while you guys do
whatever it is you're doing.

842
00:32:52,753 --> 00:32:53,908
Okay?

843
00:32:53,988 --> 00:32:54,989
Good idea.

844
00:32:56,323 --> 00:32:57,461
Look at that.

845
00:32:57,625 --> 00:32:59,647
Pink little ass just bouncing away,
saying...

846
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:03,250
Terry, come get me, Terry, come get me

847
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:04,418
No, it's saying...

848
00:33:04,498 --> 00:33:08,503
Mike, crawl up in this
Mike, crawl up in this

849
00:33:08,669 --> 00:33:10,444
Whoa. What's up, double trouble?

850
00:33:10,638 --> 00:33:11,859
Terry. Cousin of the bride.

851
00:33:11,939 --> 00:33:13,179
Get at me later,
we'll make a Terry sandwich.

852
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,819
Don't touch her. She has chlamydia.

853
00:33:14,975 --> 00:33:16,113
- Everybody does.
- No.

854
00:33:16,543 --> 00:33:17,544
Not everyone does.

855
00:33:18,212 --> 00:33:20,634
Saw you and Dave are doing your
speech together at the rehearsal dinner.

856
00:33:20,714 --> 00:33:21,702
Mmm-hmm.

857
00:33:21,782 --> 00:33:24,320
I'm going to bring the house down
with my speech.

858
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:26,327
And why do you think
you're such a hotshot?

859
00:33:26,454 --> 00:33:27,626
You know Chris Rock?

860
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:30,392
He's my neighbor.
Practiced my speech on him.

861
00:33:30,859 --> 00:33:32,998
And he gave me seven killer jokes.

862
00:33:34,329 --> 00:33:36,673
Suck on that, cousin.

863
00:33:37,298 --> 00:33:38,320
Terry out.

864
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,210
Chris Rock? Fuck! That sounds awesome.

865
00:33:53,214 --> 00:33:56,218
Oh, my God. You were right.
These cheeseburgers are amazing.

866
00:33:56,384 --> 00:33:57,522
I know.

867
00:33:57,686 --> 00:33:59,529
Being a good girl is hard.

868
00:33:59,688 --> 00:34:01,600
I know. It sucks.

869
00:34:02,591 --> 00:34:05,572
You were hitting that booze
too hard for a nice girl.

870
00:34:05,761 --> 00:34:07,138
You need to get Luke out of your head.

871
00:34:07,263 --> 00:34:09,038
- Yeah.
- You do.

872
00:34:09,198 --> 00:34:11,610
And what better way to do that...

873
00:34:11,867 --> 00:34:14,541
than good old-fashioned dick flicks.

874
00:34:14,704 --> 00:34:16,843
- Yes.
- Oh, God.

875
00:34:19,108 --> 00:34:22,282
Tatiana. Mike Stangle.

876
00:34:22,445 --> 00:34:24,447
From the meet and greet.
Well, from before that.

877
00:34:24,613 --> 00:34:26,092
One second.

878
00:34:26,182 --> 00:34:27,183
Fuck.

879
00:34:28,417 --> 00:34:30,590
Hey. It's you.

880
00:34:30,753 --> 00:34:31,857
It is me.

881
00:34:32,021 --> 00:34:37,369
I was hoping maybe I could come in
and we could watch a movie or...

882
00:34:38,594 --> 00:34:41,834
- Do whatever you wanna do.
- Why are you whispering?

883
00:34:41,965 --> 00:34:44,104
'Cause that's what we were doing before.

884
00:34:44,267 --> 00:34:45,302
They've got Cockbusters.

885
00:34:45,535 --> 00:34:47,446
Is that supposed to be like Ghostbusters?

886
00:34:47,537 --> 00:34:49,483
Why would you wanna get rid of the cocks?

887
00:34:49,706 --> 00:34:51,447
- What's that?
- She's talking in her sleep.

888
00:34:51,608 --> 00:34:54,452
She says the craziest stuff in her sleep.

889
00:34:54,544 --> 00:34:56,700
It looks like his dick is gonna pop.
It's so veiny and hard.

890
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:57,781
- Tatiana!
- Something's hard?

891
00:34:57,948 --> 00:35:00,785
Julio. My student. I'm doing
a Skype class session with him...

892
00:35:00,951 --> 00:35:03,056
and he's having a really hard time
in the schoolyard.

893
00:35:03,186 --> 00:35:04,675
If you don't get in here,
I'm gonna start masturbating!

894
00:35:04,755 --> 00:35:06,257
Oh, phooey. I've gotta go.

895
00:35:06,423 --> 00:35:07,978
That sounds like you guys are,
watching porno, or...

896
00:35:08,058 --> 00:35:09,046
- No.
- Tatiana!

897
00:35:09,126 --> 00:35:10,127
Does it smell like weed in here?

898
00:35:10,227 --> 00:35:12,104
- You guys smoking weed?
- No. It was a skunk.

899
00:35:12,262 --> 00:35:14,765
I've gotta go, because a bunch of kids
are waiting to hear...

900
00:35:14,931 --> 00:35:16,638
if they've failed second grade or not.

901
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,838
Well, I am doing
some grading myself, and girl...

902
00:35:20,004 --> 00:35:22,460
you are getting an A plus.

903
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,541
Thank you so much.

904
00:35:24,175 --> 00:35:25,176
Mmm.

905
00:35:57,041 --> 00:35:59,198
- And then win!
- Skills. Def skills.

906
00:35:59,278 --> 00:36:00,780
Cheers to Tatiana and Alice.

907
00:36:00,946 --> 00:36:02,684
We're so glad you're here.

908
00:36:03,448 --> 00:36:04,518
Yes. Cheers.

909
00:36:04,683 --> 00:36:06,788
You guys, Alice and I found
this really cool thing.

910
00:36:06,952 --> 00:36:08,659
Jurassic Park ATV Tours!

911
00:36:09,721 --> 00:36:11,894
You ride ATVs
where they shot Jurassic Park.

912
00:36:12,124 --> 00:36:16,300
Actually, we are about to go
swimming with the dolphins.

913
00:36:16,829 --> 00:36:18,638
It's on the itinerary, so...

914
00:36:18,864 --> 00:36:20,741
But, guys, Jurassic P!

915
00:36:20,833 --> 00:36:22,244
I love this movie!

916
00:36:22,401 --> 00:36:24,904
Oh, my gosh, on ATVs,
this would be so sick.

917
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:26,310
"Welcome...

918
00:36:26,471 --> 00:36:29,213
"...to Jurassic Park."

919
00:36:29,308 --> 00:36:30,412
"That is a big pile of shit."

920
00:36:30,576 --> 00:36:33,084
"Oh, you're not so scary, little guy."

921
00:36:39,018 --> 00:36:40,326
What is going on here?

922
00:36:41,821 --> 00:36:43,009
Oh! Oh!

923
00:36:43,089 --> 00:36:46,229
I wish we could do that...

924
00:36:46,392 --> 00:36:48,235
but we have a date with the dolphins...

925
00:36:48,394 --> 00:36:49,737
at the bottom of the ocean, so...

926
00:36:49,896 --> 00:36:52,342
Don't you think we should do
what Jeanie wants to do?

927
00:36:52,498 --> 00:36:54,034
I mean, it is her wedding after all.

928
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,406
Right, Mike?

929
00:37:24,698 --> 00:37:26,644
I'm so happy we're here!

930
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,246
This is where the dinos
ran in the prairie!

931
00:37:29,403 --> 00:37:30,404
I know, girl!

932
00:37:30,571 --> 00:37:32,744
Check it out! I'm a brontosaurus!

933
00:37:32,907 --> 00:37:35,944
I'm a T-Rex. I'm coming to get you!

934
00:37:36,577 --> 00:37:38,955
Guys, butts on seats, okay?
No hot dogging!

935
00:37:44,652 --> 00:37:46,131
"They're flocking this way!"

936
00:37:47,521 --> 00:37:49,023
Here's a T-Rex!

937
00:37:49,323 --> 00:37:51,098
"Life finds a way."

938
00:38:00,402 --> 00:38:02,404
Jeanie! Eric!

939
00:38:02,504 --> 00:38:03,983
Hey!

940
00:38:04,105 --> 00:38:07,018
Hi! Sorry, I lost Eric.

941
00:38:07,175 --> 00:38:10,281
I wasn't lost.
Just driving at a reasonable pace.

942
00:38:10,545 --> 00:38:11,785
Stay there. We'll come to you.

943
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:15,261
All right, we better go around.
This ledge looks super dangerous.

944
00:38:15,417 --> 00:38:17,624
Oh, yeah, Mike's right.
It does look dangerous.

945
00:38:18,186 --> 00:38:20,792
It's a good thing my middle name
is "dangerous!"

946
00:38:20,956 --> 00:38:21,943
Yeah, it is!

947
00:38:22,023 --> 00:38:23,934
- Whoo!
- Whoa!

948
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:29,809
- Oh, God!
- What?

949
00:38:32,434 --> 00:38:34,072
Oh, my God, she's Superman!

950
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:40,113
Oh, my God!

951
00:38:40,209 --> 00:38:41,483
A-Money!

952
00:38:47,016 --> 00:38:48,461
I still think we should go around.

953
00:38:48,584 --> 00:38:50,860
She just got some serious air, bro!

954
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:53,729
You call that serious air?
Check this fucking shit out.

955
00:38:53,823 --> 00:38:54,961
Whoa!

956
00:38:55,057 --> 00:38:56,913
Suck my clit, fuckers!

957
00:38:56,993 --> 00:38:57,994
Whoa!

958
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:01,784
Whoa!

959
00:39:01,864 --> 00:39:02,899
Oh, not again.

960
00:39:03,899 --> 00:39:04,887
Yeah, baby!

961
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:07,140
Easy does it. Nothing fancy.

962
00:39:13,009 --> 00:39:15,149
- Oh, my God. Look at what she's doing!
- I see it!

963
00:39:15,345 --> 00:39:17,447
Sweet candied nuts.

964
00:39:22,486 --> 00:39:24,022
Who are these girls?

965
00:39:26,089 --> 00:39:27,090
Whoa!

966
00:39:27,257 --> 00:39:28,930
Um...

967
00:39:29,026 --> 00:39:31,597
Where did you guys learn to do that?

968
00:39:31,762 --> 00:39:33,517
- We lived in Baja.
- Oh.

969
00:39:33,597 --> 00:39:35,270
Tore up a lot of trail down there.

970
00:39:35,532 --> 00:39:36,772
Made a lot of friends.

971
00:39:37,434 --> 00:39:38,936
Made even more enemies.

972
00:39:39,102 --> 00:39:40,274
God, I miss Baja.

973
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:45,281
Your turn, Mike! Don't be a pussy!

974
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:49,218
I'm not gonna do it.
Name calling doesn't work on me, so...

975
00:39:49,379 --> 00:39:52,121
Mike, it'll turn me on
if you take that jump.

976
00:39:52,282 --> 00:39:54,058
Turn me on if you don't.

977
00:39:54,218 --> 00:39:56,220
Still not going to, still.

978
00:39:56,387 --> 00:39:57,388
I'm not gonna do it.

979
00:39:57,555 --> 00:39:58,693
Like we would ever do that.

980
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:00,611
No way.

981
00:40:00,691 --> 00:40:03,133
Come on! Do it.
He's not gonna do it. Do it!

982
00:40:03,294 --> 00:40:04,773
Do not do it.

983
00:40:04,929 --> 00:40:06,567
No, definitely don't do that.

984
00:40:06,798 --> 00:40:08,675
It's a bad idea. It's a stupid, dumb idea.

985
00:40:08,766 --> 00:40:10,905
- And it's dangerous, and it's foolish.
- Yes, it is.

986
00:40:11,436 --> 00:40:12,642
I'm gonna do it!

987
00:40:14,305 --> 00:40:16,040
Mike!

988
00:40:17,375 --> 00:40:18,479
- Oh, shit!
- Oh.

989
00:40:18,976 --> 00:40:20,148
Oh!

990
00:40:20,278 --> 00:40:22,250
I'm never gonna die!

991
00:40:24,615 --> 00:40:26,337
- Oh, shit.
- He going fast.

992
00:40:26,417 --> 00:40:28,055
Oh, no. Keep it straight!

993
00:40:32,023 --> 00:40:33,058
Oh, he's shanking it.

994
00:40:36,261 --> 00:40:37,638
Whoo! Got it, got it!

995
00:40:42,835 --> 00:40:44,143
Oh, no, God!

996
00:40:44,269 --> 00:40:45,304
Jeanie, move!

997
00:40:48,307 --> 00:40:49,650
No!

998
00:40:49,808 --> 00:40:50,843
No!

999
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:52,612
No!

1000
00:40:52,744 --> 00:40:54,018
No!

1001
00:41:15,468 --> 00:41:17,778
It's gonna be fine.

1002
00:41:18,238 --> 00:41:20,293
Your face is making me think
it's gonna be bad.

1003
00:41:20,373 --> 00:41:22,262
I'm sure it's not as bad as you think.

1004
00:41:22,342 --> 00:41:23,363
- You know?
- No. Yeah.

1005
00:41:23,443 --> 00:41:24,581
Just show us what we're working with,

1006
00:41:24,711 --> 00:41:25,732
and it'll be fine.

1007
00:41:25,812 --> 00:41:26,813
- Okay.
- Okay?

1008
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,468
Is it okay?

1009
00:41:28,548 --> 00:41:30,084
- Oh, my God!
- Oh! God! Oh!

1010
00:41:30,416 --> 00:41:32,862
Wow! Don't you look good?

1011
00:41:34,687 --> 00:41:36,530
- Your face!
- Shut up, Mike!

1012
00:41:36,656 --> 00:41:38,465
You shut up, Becky!
Have you seen her face?

1013
00:41:38,625 --> 00:41:40,468
Oh, God! What?

1014
00:41:40,627 --> 00:41:42,903
It looks like you were making meth,
and the bathtub exploded.

1015
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:45,473
You look like Burn Victim Barbie.

1016
00:41:45,865 --> 00:41:47,173
Hush it up!

1017
00:41:47,333 --> 00:41:48,488
And you're Black Ken.

1018
00:41:48,568 --> 00:41:50,514
- Stop!
- Okay.

1019
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:52,726
It's like an exaggerated smoky eye.

1020
00:41:52,806 --> 00:41:54,808
Dave, be honest. Is it bad?

1021
00:41:55,576 --> 00:41:57,749
This side, there's a little...

1022
00:41:57,845 --> 00:41:59,967
- There's a little discoloration there.
- Little discoloration.

1023
00:42:00,047 --> 00:42:01,185
Which side is it?

1024
00:42:01,415 --> 00:42:02,570
You could do a dance the whole night

1025
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:04,186
where you just hold a hand over your face.

1026
00:42:04,318 --> 00:42:05,319
- Oh, that's smart.
- Okay.

1027
00:42:05,486 --> 00:42:06,487
It's like a new thing.

1028
00:42:06,654 --> 00:42:10,360
- Do the Jeanie, do the Jeanie
- Like this?

1029
00:42:10,591 --> 00:42:12,400
- Come on, everybody! Do the Jeanie.
- Do it.

1030
00:42:12,593 --> 00:42:13,970
- I'm doing the Jeanie.
- Do the Jeanie, y'all.

1031
00:42:14,061 --> 00:42:15,096
It's a one-two step.

1032
00:42:15,229 --> 00:42:17,038
All right, that's enough.

1033
00:42:17,298 --> 00:42:18,902
Enough dancing! You and you...

1034
00:42:19,033 --> 00:42:20,410
outside, now!

1035
00:42:20,568 --> 00:42:22,474
Honey, calm down.

1036
00:42:23,571 --> 00:42:25,073
- Honey, calm down.
- Sorry.

1037
00:42:25,239 --> 00:42:27,583
Do you understand they've deformed
our little girl...

1038
00:42:27,741 --> 00:42:29,880
the day before her goddamn wedding?

1039
00:42:30,144 --> 00:42:32,267
She looks like Seal, for Christ's sake!

1040
00:42:32,347 --> 00:42:34,169
Oh! Why, Dad?

1041
00:42:34,249 --> 00:42:35,250
Ow!

1042
00:42:36,351 --> 00:42:37,694
Do you think he's gonna spank us?

1043
00:42:37,852 --> 00:42:38,853
What?

1044
00:42:39,621 --> 00:42:40,622
Never mind.

1045
00:42:40,722 --> 00:42:42,677
I haven't seen him this pissed
in a long time.

1046
00:42:42,757 --> 00:42:43,792
OOP-

1047
00:42:43,892 --> 00:42:45,701
Yeah. It's the other door.

1048
00:42:46,628 --> 00:42:47,716
They meet in the middle.

1049
00:42:47,796 --> 00:42:49,400
- They meet in the middle.
- God damn it!

1050
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,978
Dad, listen. I know what you're gonna say.

1051
00:42:54,102 --> 00:42:56,358
- You're right.
- We're gonna sue the ATV companies.

1052
00:42:56,438 --> 00:42:57,644
- Right?
- I see.

1053
00:42:57,772 --> 00:42:58,773
Not what I was gonna say.

1054
00:42:58,907 --> 00:43:00,147
Let's Erin Brockovich this bitch.

1055
00:43:00,308 --> 00:43:01,878
Mike, stop!

1056
00:43:02,043 --> 00:43:04,266
You've got to own this.
This is your fault.

1057
00:43:04,346 --> 00:43:05,347
It's not.

1058
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,917
If anything, it's the girls' fault.

1059
00:43:08,183 --> 00:43:09,491
They're crazy.

1060
00:43:09,651 --> 00:43:12,041
The girls aren't the problem!

1061
00:43:12,121 --> 00:43:13,498
You are.

1062
00:43:13,656 --> 00:43:15,795
What the hell did you think
was gonna happen, huh?

1063
00:43:15,958 --> 00:43:17,665
What did you think was gonna happen?

1064
00:43:17,827 --> 00:43:18,828
We had a plan.

1065
00:43:18,995 --> 00:43:21,407
The plan was to swim with dolphins...

1066
00:43:21,564 --> 00:43:23,271
and eat bananas afterwards.

1067
00:43:23,432 --> 00:43:25,173
See, Dad, I'm not gonna
point any fingers here...

1068
00:43:25,334 --> 00:43:26,335
but indirectly...

1069
00:43:26,502 --> 00:43:29,176
we wouldn't have been on ATVs
if the girls hadn't forced us to.

1070
00:43:29,338 --> 00:43:31,784
And who made us bring dates
in the first place?

1071
00:43:32,942 --> 00:43:33,996
- Not pointing fingers.
- Yeah.

1072
00:43:34,076 --> 00:43:36,317
All right. I'm gonna take back
what I said to you earlier.

1073
00:43:36,479 --> 00:43:38,618
I am going to lump you in together.

1074
00:43:38,781 --> 00:43:41,591
All right, you are lumped!

1075
00:43:42,251 --> 00:43:44,162
The hell is wrong with you, huh?

1076
00:43:45,288 --> 00:43:46,665
What the hell is wrong with you?

1077
00:43:48,257 --> 00:43:49,635
Dad.

1078
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:53,673
Fuck.

1079
00:43:56,233 --> 00:43:58,270
Everyone get the fuck away from me.

1080
00:43:58,435 --> 00:44:00,847
Move! Adult Swim!

1081
00:44:01,004 --> 00:44:04,281
It's all fucked now.
It's all fucked, you know? Poor Jeanie.

1082
00:44:04,574 --> 00:44:06,430
Jeanie's special weekend, and I ruin it.

1083
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:10,083
Hey, hey, hey, Alice?
That was not your fault, okay?

1084
00:44:10,347 --> 00:44:13,170
That's two weddings that I've ruined.
It's just like, "Stupid Alice!"

1085
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:15,628
Look, it's too bad that
Jeanie's face got shredded...

1086
00:44:15,919 --> 00:44:17,507
but this is supposed to be our vacay.

1087
00:44:17,587 --> 00:44:19,376
Remember? We're supposed
to be having fun...

1088
00:44:19,456 --> 00:44:20,577
and going on adventures.

1089
00:44:20,657 --> 00:44:21,761
Get in here with me.

1090
00:44:21,925 --> 00:44:23,268
I'm gonna find her.
I'm gonna make it up to her.

1091
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:25,930
No, no! You're not listening to me.
Don't leave me!

1092
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,629
Thanks again for letting me
join your spa day, ladies.

1093
00:44:37,709 --> 00:44:41,452
It's not like you asked or anything,
but you're here. Yay.

1094
00:44:41,879 --> 00:44:43,984
What did you guys do
for your bachelorette party?

1095
00:44:44,282 --> 00:44:46,137
Did it get crazy?
Did you guys do that thing...

1096
00:44:46,217 --> 00:44:49,027
where you go to Vegas
and you dress up as a prostitute...

1097
00:44:49,354 --> 00:44:51,042
and you go out and there's a contest...

1098
00:44:51,122 --> 00:44:53,329
to see who can get the most money
from a john...

1099
00:44:53,591 --> 00:44:55,413
but then you tell him,
"I'm an undercover cop"...

1100
00:44:55,493 --> 00:44:58,531
and they, like, beg that you don't tell
their children and their wives...

1101
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:01,336
and they piss themselves,
and you've got the whole thing on video.

1102
00:45:01,499 --> 00:45:04,571
And then you put it on YouTube
and then there's the Auto-Tune remix.

1103
00:45:04,736 --> 00:45:05,737
Did you do that thing?

1104
00:45:06,404 --> 00:45:07,475
- No.
- No.

1105
00:45:07,806 --> 00:45:12,312
I didn't actually end up having one, so...

1106
00:45:12,478 --> 00:45:14,116
Why? Every bride
needs a bachelorette party.

1107
00:45:14,313 --> 00:45:16,468
I'm sorry Cabo didn't work out, Jeanie.

1108
00:45:16,548 --> 00:45:18,037
I know. It's fine.

1109
00:45:18,117 --> 00:45:19,171
You know I couldn't get the time off work.

1110
00:45:19,251 --> 00:45:21,640
And it would have ruined it for you,
down there without me.

1111
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:22,875
Is there some tension about this?

1112
00:45:22,955 --> 00:45:25,577
So I just thought, "Let's cancel
the whole trip," if that makes sense.

1113
00:45:25,657 --> 00:45:27,613
Jeanie, can you keep it down?
On the phone with Tokyo.

1114
00:45:27,693 --> 00:45:28,781
Did I bring up something uncomfortable?

1115
00:45:28,861 --> 00:45:31,205
Also, I caught the shingles
because it was so stressful.

1116
00:45:33,165 --> 00:45:34,219
'Cause it feels like I did.

1117
00:45:34,299 --> 00:45:36,835
Plus they have Mexican bed bugs.

1118
00:45:38,337 --> 00:45:40,681
I need you guys to stop it!

1119
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:44,050
Oh, that fucking gaping mouth of yours,
shut it!

1120
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:45,611
Shut it!

1121
00:45:46,044 --> 00:45:49,788
I just want to relax!
Is that too much to ask?

1122
00:45:50,183 --> 00:45:52,789
Please! I just wanna relax.

1123
00:45:55,455 --> 00:45:56,729
How are you feeling, Jeanie?

1124
00:45:56,890 --> 00:45:58,369
A little stressed out.

1125
00:45:58,525 --> 00:46:01,369
- I'll give you a minute to disrobe.
- Yeah, okay.

1126
00:46:01,528 --> 00:46:03,599
Face down on the table.

1127
00:46:03,997 --> 00:46:07,454
Hi, um, that is my best friend in there...

1128
00:46:07,534 --> 00:46:09,707
and she's getting married tomorrow,
and she's a little uptight.

1129
00:46:10,003 --> 00:46:15,146
And I was wondering if you could, um,
help her let loose a little bit?

1130
00:46:15,308 --> 00:46:16,329
You know?

1131
00:46:16,409 --> 00:46:21,415
Give her the "Hawaii Five Oh" experience?

1132
00:46:21,781 --> 00:46:24,404
The wink-wink, nudge-nudge massage,
you know?

1133
00:46:24,484 --> 00:46:27,989
I can't really wink,
but a wink-wink, nudge-nudge?

1134
00:46:28,289 --> 00:46:30,010
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1135
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:31,763
Looks like you had a bit of a fit.

1136
00:46:31,959 --> 00:46:34,530
No, no. That's wink... That's wink-wink...

1137
00:46:35,796 --> 00:46:38,003
I feel like I've gotten
what you're trying to say.

1138
00:46:38,232 --> 00:46:40,454
- Great.
- But I figured it out.

1139
00:46:40,534 --> 00:46:43,124
- You didn't really communicate it to me.
- Okay, that's fair.

1140
00:46:43,204 --> 00:46:47,050
Yes, you want the special
"I am blissful" massage?

1141
00:46:47,174 --> 00:46:49,279
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1142
00:46:49,777 --> 00:46:50,812
Um...

1143
00:46:50,911 --> 00:46:52,822
- How blissful is that?
- Oh, don't worry.

1144
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:54,516
Physically, no penetration.

1145
00:46:54,615 --> 00:46:55,603
Classy.

1146
00:46:55,683 --> 00:46:58,687
Spiritually, I'll be doing
an intimate tour of her chi.

1147
00:46:58,986 --> 00:47:01,023
Oh, you're gonna be good in there.
I can tell.

1148
00:47:02,189 --> 00:47:03,293
How's the temperature in here, Jeanie?

1149
00:47:04,091 --> 00:47:05,969
Oh, it's good. Good. Comfy.

1150
00:47:06,127 --> 00:47:09,472
Good. Take down the light a little bit.

1151
00:47:09,631 --> 00:47:11,338
So you're getting married, huh?

1152
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:13,136
I am. Yeah.

1153
00:47:13,335 --> 00:47:16,191
I know it can be a stressful time.

1154
00:47:16,271 --> 00:47:20,185
You know it's like, "Who is this for,
me or my family?"

1155
00:47:20,342 --> 00:47:22,788
Yeah. I've recently had
an injury to my face...

1156
00:47:22,944 --> 00:47:24,946
which I'm a little stressed out about.

1157
00:47:25,647 --> 00:47:26,648
Are you okay with oil?

1158
00:47:26,815 --> 00:47:28,123
Yeah, sure.

1159
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:32,374
You know, in my country...

1160
00:47:32,454 --> 00:47:35,731
they call oil "God's beautiful lubricant."

1161
00:47:36,725 --> 00:47:38,898
It sounds better in my language.

1162
00:47:42,464 --> 00:47:44,053
Oh, that's lovely.

1163
00:47:44,133 --> 00:47:45,154
'kay.

1164
00:47:45,234 --> 00:47:46,622
Some ground rules.

1165
00:47:46,702 --> 00:47:49,292
One, no emotions.

1166
00:47:49,372 --> 00:47:51,477
- Okay.
- Two, breathe.

1167
00:47:53,042 --> 00:47:57,182
Three, there is no penetration,
only vibration.

1168
00:47:58,481 --> 00:48:00,859
What is happening?

1169
00:48:01,217 --> 00:48:03,458
I call this "The Bent Penguin."

1170
00:48:03,619 --> 00:48:06,099
This one is just "The Ham and Eggs."

1171
00:48:06,255 --> 00:48:09,168
This one is called "When Moons Collide."

1172
00:48:09,325 --> 00:48:11,828
"Angry Hummingbird." "Angry Hummingbird."

1173
00:48:11,994 --> 00:48:14,372
This one is called "House by the Airport."

1174
00:48:14,530 --> 00:48:16,771
Just checking in. Everything good?

1175
00:48:16,933 --> 00:48:19,607
Hope you're enjoying this.
For me, it's just another Friday.

1176
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:29,253
"Happy Doll."

1177
00:48:29,613 --> 00:48:33,720
This one is just called
"Taking a Break." I am pooped.

1178
00:48:33,884 --> 00:48:36,626
A little break. That's nice.

1179
00:48:38,522 --> 00:48:39,660
Here we go again.

1180
00:48:41,558 --> 00:48:43,094
Are you even touching me?

1181
00:48:43,293 --> 00:48:45,773
No, but my aura is.

1182
00:48:46,063 --> 00:48:48,585
Yes, it is!

1183
00:48:48,665 --> 00:48:51,077
Sweet baby Jesus!

1184
00:49:10,188 --> 00:49:11,326
How's it going?

1185
00:49:11,856 --> 00:49:14,336
Shit, I thought I was alone in here.

1186
00:49:14,492 --> 00:49:17,439
Oh, yeah. You're not. I mean, we're alone.

1187
00:49:18,029 --> 00:49:20,373
How's Mike? Still really jealous of me?

1188
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:24,776
It's like, yeah, okay,
do I own a Tesla? Yes.

1189
00:49:24,936 --> 00:49:27,576
Do I make a shit-ton of money,
like, way more than Mike?

1190
00:49:27,739 --> 00:49:29,047
Yes. But it's like, who cares?

1191
00:49:29,207 --> 00:49:31,278
Do I get backstage tickets to Rihanna?

1192
00:49:31,542 --> 00:49:34,098
Do I have a glass blowing
studio in my basement?

1193
00:49:34,178 --> 00:49:36,180
Hold up, backstage tickets to Rihanna?

1194
00:49:36,347 --> 00:49:38,258
Yeah, she likes to have me around.
You know.

1195
00:49:38,416 --> 00:49:41,340
- RiRi is Alice's jam.
- Oh, RiRi, is it?

1196
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:42,455
- Yes.
- That's funny.

1197
00:49:42,621 --> 00:49:45,101
She would freak out if I got her
backstage tickets to Rihanna.

1198
00:49:45,257 --> 00:49:48,397
Well, you could get her tickets.
From me. I'm right here.

1199
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:49,937
Are you serious?

1200
00:49:50,095 --> 00:49:53,406
Oh, God, steam rooms just open up
your pores, you know?

1201
00:49:54,066 --> 00:49:56,103
They open up everything.

1202
00:49:59,238 --> 00:50:03,462
Backstage at RiRi is very fun.
Sometimes she plays the DJ.

1203
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:07,216
You know, just scratching records.
You know like...

1204
00:50:10,649 --> 00:50:12,322
Shit, man. That's...

1205
00:50:12,751 --> 00:50:15,808
Are you saying you want me
to get in there for the tickets?

1206
00:50:15,888 --> 00:50:18,630
No. No, no, no. No.

1207
00:50:19,458 --> 00:50:21,132
Yes.

1208
00:50:24,798 --> 00:50:26,141
Tatiana?

1209
00:50:27,067 --> 00:50:28,307
Tatiana? Whoa.

1210
00:50:29,135 --> 00:50:32,173
Sorry about that.
Looking for my wedding date.

1211
00:50:32,739 --> 00:50:33,740
Tatiana?

1212
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:34,978
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

1213
00:50:39,145 --> 00:50:40,180
Please leave, sir.

1214
00:50:40,346 --> 00:50:41,586
What are you doing to my sister?

1215
00:50:41,748 --> 00:50:44,285
- Mike, I'm coming.
- No!

1216
00:50:54,794 --> 00:50:56,000
Get out!

1217
00:51:00,034 --> 00:51:03,447
Oh, sure. Oh, sure. Oh, sure.

1218
00:51:03,604 --> 00:51:05,447
So, are we, like, close, or...

1219
00:51:06,107 --> 00:51:09,078
Let's put the washing machine
on spin cycle. There we go.

1220
00:51:09,377 --> 00:51:11,285
What the... Tatiana!

1221
00:51:11,445 --> 00:51:12,651
Terry!

1222
00:51:12,813 --> 00:51:14,156
Terry!

1223
00:51:14,315 --> 00:51:16,556
- Tatiana!
- Shut the fuck up, Mike.

1224
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:20,107
Whoa!

1225
00:51:20,187 --> 00:51:21,993
I'm gonna kick your ass.

1226
00:51:24,492 --> 00:51:25,903
He is losing this fight!

1227
00:51:28,229 --> 00:51:30,084
Oh, God! I can see your nipple!

1228
00:51:30,164 --> 00:51:31,165
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1229
00:51:34,235 --> 00:51:36,239
Get your butt out of my face!

1230
00:51:40,408 --> 00:51:43,651
Well, thank you so much.

1231
00:51:44,179 --> 00:51:45,715
Um, I definitely needed this.

1232
00:51:45,881 --> 00:51:48,691
I know.
Bring this gift into your marriage.

1233
00:51:49,251 --> 00:51:52,926
- All you need is load-bearing ribbons.
- Okay.

1234
00:51:53,088 --> 00:51:55,577
- And a reinforced ceiling.
- Oh.

1235
00:51:55,657 --> 00:51:56,931
I should warn you...

1236
00:51:57,058 --> 00:52:01,131
you may experience some
aftershock orgasms.

1237
00:52:01,363 --> 00:52:02,569
Oh.

1238
00:52:02,731 --> 00:52:05,905
So, I wouldn't operate any heavy machinery
for a couple weeks.

1239
00:52:06,067 --> 00:52:08,673
That is not a euphemism for penis.
I mean like...

1240
00:52:08,837 --> 00:52:13,286
- tractors, cranes, big boats.
- Okay.

1241
00:52:13,441 --> 00:52:15,114
Good to know.

1242
00:52:15,277 --> 00:52:17,621
- Oh, and please hydrate.
- Okay.

1243
00:52:17,779 --> 00:52:21,853
I cannot stress this enough.
The consequences could be...

1244
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:24,564
You could develop cancer.

1245
00:52:26,088 --> 00:52:27,396
You have a very good friend.

1246
00:52:32,762 --> 00:52:35,242
Wait, you did that?

1247
00:52:35,598 --> 00:52:38,488
Yeah, well, I felt so bad
about your fucked up face...

1248
00:52:38,568 --> 00:52:39,979
and I wanted to make it up to you.

1249
00:52:40,603 --> 00:52:41,946
Aw! Thank you.

1250
00:52:42,271 --> 00:52:45,115
Hey, who needs a bachelorette party
when they have you around?

1251
00:52:46,475 --> 00:52:48,364
- He rubbed my butt.
- Yeah?

1252
00:52:48,444 --> 00:52:50,219
But with his butt.

1253
00:52:50,379 --> 00:52:52,985
It was like... He was on ribbons.

1254
00:52:54,283 --> 00:52:55,872
I don't know what you did
with Jeanie in the spa...

1255
00:52:55,952 --> 00:52:57,541
but she's in a great mood.

1256
00:52:57,621 --> 00:53:00,124
Yeah, no problem.
She just needed a release.

1257
00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:02,634
Oh, um, I had an idea for your graphic novel.

1258
00:53:02,793 --> 00:53:05,048
I thought you could do
like a Rum character,

1259
00:53:05,128 --> 00:53:06,630
who's like Rastafarian, and he's like...

1260
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:11,200
"I'm Rum Rum, get in my tum-tum,
and I play the steel drum."

1261
00:53:11,735 --> 00:53:13,271
"You can rum, but you cannot hide, man."

1262
00:53:13,437 --> 00:53:15,940
Yeah, that's awesome.
Already, that's so amazing.

1263
00:53:16,106 --> 00:53:18,416
No, that's such a good idea.
How did I not figure that?

1264
00:53:20,444 --> 00:53:24,483
I think when I get back,
I'm gonna stop selling liquor with Mike...

1265
00:53:24,648 --> 00:53:26,127
and start drawing full time.

1266
00:53:26,283 --> 00:53:27,762
- Really?
- Yeah.

1267
00:53:27,918 --> 00:53:29,420
That's amazing.

1268
00:53:29,586 --> 00:53:31,793
Do you know how few people
know what they really wanna do?

1269
00:53:31,955 --> 00:53:34,111
But then I think about
what Mike's gonna think about it all...

1270
00:53:34,191 --> 00:53:36,171
and he's gonna hate that idea.

1271
00:53:36,327 --> 00:53:38,034
He's so clingy.

1272
00:53:38,196 --> 00:53:41,019
When we were kids,
if I fell asleep before Mike...

1273
00:53:41,099 --> 00:53:43,170
he would always wake me up
so he wouldn't feel alone.

1274
00:53:43,334 --> 00:53:45,177
- That's kinda sweet.
- Yeah.

1275
00:53:45,336 --> 00:53:46,974
I don't know. I just...

1276
00:53:50,775 --> 00:53:52,152
Do you ever get that feeling...

1277
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:55,814
that you're not good enough
to get what you really want...

1278
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:57,789
so you're too scared to try?

1279
00:53:59,517 --> 00:54:00,825
All the time.

1280
00:54:01,519 --> 00:54:04,295
- Really?
- Like, all the time. It's terrifying.

1281
00:54:04,455 --> 00:54:06,332
- It is, it's terrifying.
- Yeah.

1282
00:54:06,491 --> 00:54:07,492
You're, like, stuck.

1283
00:54:07,659 --> 00:54:09,297
- Totally.
- Yeah.

1284
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:10,962
Thanks. It's nice talking to you
about this.

1285
00:54:24,343 --> 00:54:25,764
Hey. Where you going?

1286
00:54:25,844 --> 00:54:28,234
Is there a gang bang in the ballroom
you need to emcee?

1287
00:54:28,314 --> 00:54:29,793
Don't be such a drama king.

1288
00:54:29,882 --> 00:54:31,589
Yeah, I'm totally overreacting.

1289
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:33,058
When you invite someone to a wedding...

1290
00:54:33,218 --> 00:54:35,474
they obviously are supposed to
finger diddle your family members.

1291
00:54:35,554 --> 00:54:36,555
That's common courtesy!

1292
00:54:36,722 --> 00:54:38,998
Okay, hold up. I am a grown-ass woman.

1293
00:54:39,191 --> 00:54:41,228
I can finger diddle whomever I want.

1294
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:43,863
Just because you say "whomever"
does not make it okay.

1295
00:54:44,029 --> 00:54:47,499
It's not a big deal.
It's just like texting someone.

1296
00:54:47,733 --> 00:54:49,679
- Oh.
- It's just like Tinder.

1297
00:54:49,835 --> 00:54:54,293
Swipe right, swipe right, swipe left.
Swipe left, swipe right.

1298
00:54:54,373 --> 00:54:56,162
That's very graphic. That is...

1299
00:54:56,242 --> 00:54:59,382
Rotating your photos.
Expanding them, contracting them.

1300
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:02,083
Are you deliberately trying to hurt me?
Is that what you're doing?

1301
00:55:02,248 --> 00:55:04,771
What? No!
I was just trying to get RiRi tickets...

1302
00:55:04,851 --> 00:55:06,797
to make my best friend feel better, okay?

1303
00:55:06,953 --> 00:55:08,455
We're on vacay.

1304
00:55:10,523 --> 00:55:11,524
No...

1305
00:55:11,691 --> 00:55:15,400
You are invited to my sister's wedding.
You're supposed to smile, nod...

1306
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:16,768
and do what I want you to do.

1307
00:55:16,930 --> 00:55:17,931
That's the deal.

1308
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:20,374
I thought that we had a connection.

1309
00:55:20,934 --> 00:55:21,935
Like a spark.

1310
00:55:22,102 --> 00:55:25,049
You thought you were gonna bring me here
so that you could have sex with me.

1311
00:55:25,372 --> 00:55:27,827
Yes. No! What? Yeah, right.

1312
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:28,908
Really?

1313
00:55:30,877 --> 00:55:32,584
Yes, obviously.

1314
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:34,784
You are so hot. And you smell good.

1315
00:55:34,949 --> 00:55:36,724
It's not a weird thing that I wanna have
sex with you...

1316
00:55:36,884 --> 00:55:38,830
because you are very sexy...

1317
00:55:38,986 --> 00:55:41,091
and you were leading me on,
and we are in Hawaii...

1318
00:55:41,255 --> 00:55:43,132
which is a sexy place,
and people have sex here.

1319
00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:45,600
God, dude,
you built this all up in your head.

1320
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,637
Alice and I just saw you on TV...

1321
00:55:47,828 --> 00:55:49,603
- wanted to go to Hawaii.
- Hold up.

1322
00:55:50,631 --> 00:55:51,632
Fuck.

1323
00:55:51,799 --> 00:55:52,800
You saw us on TV?

1324
00:55:52,967 --> 00:55:55,369
No, I don't even watch Wendy Williams.

1325
00:56:00,241 --> 00:56:01,242
What?

1326
00:56:02,476 --> 00:56:04,012
- What?
- Shh!

1327
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:05,419
I thought you dug me.

1328
00:56:05,579 --> 00:56:06,853
Are you even a teacher?

1329
00:56:09,850 --> 00:56:10,851
No.

1330
00:56:11,018 --> 00:56:12,019
What about little Julio...

1331
00:56:12,186 --> 00:56:14,326
the dyslexic boy
who you taught how to read?

1332
00:56:14,489 --> 00:56:16,867
Made it up. All of it.

1333
00:56:17,025 --> 00:56:19,301
Although I did have sex
with this guy name Julio once...

1334
00:56:19,461 --> 00:56:20,963
and I'm pretty sure he couldn't read.

1335
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:24,433
Here I thought you were Michelle Pfeiffer
from Dangerous Minds.

1336
00:56:24,599 --> 00:56:26,772
Turns out, you're Michelle Pfeiffer
from Scarface.

1337
00:56:27,469 --> 00:56:28,880
And you didn't even

1338
00:56:29,037 --> 00:56:32,416
say hello to my little friend.

1339
00:56:36,978 --> 00:56:38,855
Oh, come on, man.

1340
00:56:39,881 --> 00:56:40,985
Mike.

1341
00:56:54,664 --> 00:56:56,473
I'm really sorry. Um...

1342
00:56:57,633 --> 00:56:59,670
I've been acting crazy.

1343
00:57:00,002 --> 00:57:02,625
It's probably about Luke, my ex.

1344
00:57:02,705 --> 00:57:05,879
Oh, yeah. The guy who
died in the plane crash...

1345
00:57:06,542 --> 00:57:08,681
with cancer, and AIDS, and stuff.

1346
00:57:08,845 --> 00:57:10,552
Yeah, that's the one.

1347
00:57:11,214 --> 00:57:13,353
Except none of that stuff happened,
'cause, um...

1348
00:57:17,153 --> 00:57:18,741
I lied.

1349
00:57:18,821 --> 00:57:19,822
You lied?

1350
00:57:21,958 --> 00:57:23,046
I can't do this.

1351
00:57:23,126 --> 00:57:24,127
Wait.

1352
00:57:24,227 --> 00:57:25,262
Sorry.

1353
00:57:25,361 --> 00:57:28,017
- That's okay. That's okay.
- Sorry everyone.

1354
00:57:28,097 --> 00:57:31,272
I just forgot my phone.
Can I grab my phone?

1355
00:57:32,002 --> 00:57:34,743
Sorry, I still don't want to get married.

1356
00:57:36,907 --> 00:57:41,087
Oh, my gosh. That's almost
as bad as the plane crash story.

1357
00:57:41,912 --> 00:57:43,391
Why didn't you just tell me?

1358
00:57:45,382 --> 00:57:47,555
I didn't want you to think
I was damaged goods.

1359
00:57:48,752 --> 00:57:50,527
I would never think that.

1360
00:57:51,355 --> 00:57:52,561
"Love hurts.

1361
00:57:53,557 --> 00:57:55,230
"Love scars.

1362
00:57:55,392 --> 00:57:59,204
"Love wounds, and mars."

1363
00:58:00,230 --> 00:58:04,406
That's from a really old song,
for old people.

1364
00:58:05,702 --> 00:58:07,477
Why are you so nice?

1365
00:58:10,475 --> 00:58:12,421
'Cause I think you're nice.

1366
00:58:19,651 --> 00:58:20,652
David!

1367
00:58:21,553 --> 00:58:24,227
David, I need you here with me now.
Come on.

1368
00:58:24,389 --> 00:58:25,629
No. No.

1369
00:58:26,057 --> 00:58:28,435
Stangles, assemble. Now!

1370
00:58:28,593 --> 00:58:30,300
- Let's go.
- Is he okay?

1371
00:58:30,395 --> 00:58:31,382
Yeah, I think he's fine.

1372
00:58:31,462 --> 00:58:32,463
He's just got a lot on his mind.

1373
00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:33,651
Let's go!

1374
00:58:33,731 --> 00:58:36,001
Okay, I'm coming, dude. Jeez.

1375
00:58:38,136 --> 00:58:39,308
Oh... I...

1376
00:58:39,404 --> 00:58:41,315
You gave me a boost up. Okay.

1377
00:58:49,013 --> 00:58:50,493
A line has been drawn, David.

1378
00:58:50,749 --> 00:58:53,239
A clear line in the sand.

1379
00:58:53,319 --> 00:58:54,907
Is that why you brought me
all the way down here...

1380
00:58:54,987 --> 00:58:57,109
so you could literally
draw a line in the sand?

1381
00:58:57,189 --> 00:58:58,377
I'm a visual thinker, David.

1382
00:58:58,457 --> 00:58:59,765
- God damn it!
- Son of a...

1383
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:03,849
These girls, they've gotta go.

1384
00:59:03,929 --> 00:59:08,105
They pretended to dig us
just to get a free trip to Hawaii.

1385
00:59:08,267 --> 00:59:09,541
They're liars!

1386
00:59:09,702 --> 00:59:11,773
So what, man? So they lied.

1387
00:59:12,204 --> 00:59:13,592
I was talking to Alice.

1388
00:59:13,672 --> 00:59:15,618
You have no idea
what this girl's been through.

1389
00:59:15,774 --> 00:59:18,277
She needed this trip.
We might have saved her life.

1390
00:59:18,644 --> 00:59:21,534
We should be practicing our speech
for tonight.

1391
00:59:21,614 --> 00:59:24,026
Not babysitting the twins
from The Shining.

1392
00:59:26,885 --> 00:59:28,364
Oh, my God.

1393
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:29,864
Why are you laughing at me?

1394
00:59:30,190 --> 00:59:32,112
You sound like mom and dad
when they're talking about us.

1395
00:59:32,192 --> 00:59:34,138
Well, no, fuck that noise.

1396
00:59:34,694 --> 00:59:36,283
Oh. Oh. Oh.

1397
00:59:36,363 --> 00:59:37,899
Guess what! You're gonna love this.

1398
00:59:38,064 --> 00:59:41,978
Tatiana was jerking off our cousin Terry.

1399
00:59:42,135 --> 00:59:43,790
- What?
- Mmm-hmm.

1400
00:59:43,870 --> 00:59:45,008
Cousin Terry has a dick?

1401
00:59:45,338 --> 00:59:46,927
No, not "jerking off" jerking off.

1402
00:59:47,007 --> 00:59:49,180
The female version of jerking.

1403
00:59:49,342 --> 00:59:51,015
Dude, let's just chill out...

1404
00:59:51,177 --> 00:59:53,316
focus on Jeanie,
and try not to be assholes...

1405
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:54,801
for the rest of the weekend, okay?
Can we do that?

1406
00:59:54,881 --> 00:59:56,519
I can't do that, David.

1407
00:59:56,916 --> 00:59:58,987
Because I saw our little sister...

1408
00:59:59,819 --> 01:00:00,820
What?

1409
01:00:01,721 --> 01:00:04,099
Well, let's just say
she was making this face...

1410
01:00:06,493 --> 01:00:08,201
What? She saw a ghost?

1411
01:00:10,331 --> 01:00:11,742
She really had to pee?

1412
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:14,101
Doing vocal warmups?

1413
01:00:14,969 --> 01:00:16,624
What are you doing?
It looks like you're having an orgasm.

1414
01:00:16,704 --> 01:00:20,049
She was, David! With the masseuse.

1415
01:00:20,574 --> 01:00:21,917
- What!
- Yes!

1416
01:00:22,109 --> 01:00:23,247
Oh, my God!

1417
01:00:23,377 --> 01:00:25,533
- She orgasms like a star.
- No!

1418
01:00:25,613 --> 01:00:26,785
What's next?

1419
01:00:27,048 --> 01:00:31,519
I'm gonna walk in on mom
giving dad a Push Pop?

1420
01:00:32,186 --> 01:00:33,221
What's a Push Pop?

1421
01:00:33,354 --> 01:00:36,699
I made it up, Dave.
It's a sexual term that I just made up.

1422
01:00:36,857 --> 01:00:39,380
- What's a Push Pop?
- I don't know.

1423
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:41,315
- What's a Push Pop?
- I don't know!

1424
01:00:41,395 --> 01:00:42,617
What's a Push Pop?

1425
01:00:42,697 --> 01:00:45,200
I've been to the bowels of the Internet,
and I've never seen a Push Pop.

1426
01:00:45,366 --> 01:00:46,936
God, just tell me! What's a Push Pop?

1427
01:00:47,102 --> 01:00:49,048
It's a whole hand up an ass, David.

1428
01:00:49,204 --> 01:00:51,115
Is that what you want me to say?

1429
01:00:51,273 --> 01:00:54,652
- Oh, God!
- Two hands pushin' the pop.

1430
01:00:54,743 --> 01:00:56,814
- Oh, God.
- Is that what you want me to say?

1431
01:00:56,912 --> 01:00:58,448
I'll send you some links.

1432
01:01:17,833 --> 01:01:19,938
- We're at table two.
- I'll be at the bar.

1433
01:01:20,102 --> 01:01:21,638
- I said table two.
- I'll be at the bar!

1434
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:22,975
You're out of control!

1435
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:24,806
Thank you.

1436
01:01:25,941 --> 01:01:27,512
Trouble in paradise?

1437
01:01:31,681 --> 01:01:34,560
Freaking I don't care if I cause a scene.

1438
01:01:34,717 --> 01:01:38,665
Freaking I will punch you 17,000 times
in the face. Freaking.

1439
01:01:38,821 --> 01:01:39,822
Take a shot.

1440
01:01:40,323 --> 01:01:42,894
You look like Don Johnson
fucked Zack Morris.

1441
01:01:43,626 --> 01:01:46,505
Wait till Tatiana hears your shitty speech
after my crazy dope one.

1442
01:01:46,662 --> 01:01:48,039
She's never gonna
touch your baby bird again.

1443
01:01:49,733 --> 01:01:51,806
Thriller-Terry out!

1444
01:01:53,469 --> 01:01:54,971
So sad!

1445
01:01:55,138 --> 01:01:56,378
Oh, my God. It's a movie about cameras

1446
01:01:56,472 --> 01:01:57,746
just following you everywhere.

1447
01:01:57,974 --> 01:02:00,296
- Like The Truman Show.
- Yeah! Exactly like The Truman Show!

1448
01:02:00,376 --> 01:02:02,083
Hey, Dave! Dave!

1449
01:02:02,245 --> 01:02:03,485
Hey, what's up?

1450
01:02:03,646 --> 01:02:06,303
I need you to come backstage right now
and practice the speech.

1451
01:02:06,383 --> 01:02:07,589
Uh...

1452
01:02:07,684 --> 01:02:09,755
Dude, I'm kind of
talking to Alice right now.

1453
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:11,661
Which is a conversation
you've now interrupted twice.

1454
01:02:11,822 --> 01:02:13,028
Our speech needs to kill.

1455
01:02:13,190 --> 01:02:15,227
Terry got a punch up from Chris Rock.

1456
01:02:15,492 --> 01:02:17,938
I didn't want to tell you before
because I didn't want you to freak out.

1457
01:02:18,095 --> 01:02:19,096
I'm not freaking out.

1458
01:02:19,229 --> 01:02:20,572
Calm the fuck down, Dave!

1459
01:02:20,731 --> 01:02:21,869
You calm the fuck down!

1460
01:02:22,032 --> 01:02:23,807
Mike, you look like
your face is gonna pop.

1461
01:02:24,034 --> 01:02:25,823
You gonna come or what?

1462
01:02:25,903 --> 01:02:27,291
Let's go.

1463
01:02:27,371 --> 01:02:29,244
I'll see you backstage.

1464
01:02:31,475 --> 01:02:32,496
Uh...

1465
01:02:32,576 --> 01:02:34,665
- I'm gonna go deal with this real quick.
- Okay.

1466
01:02:34,745 --> 01:02:36,691
I'll just talk to myself for a while.
All alone.

1467
01:02:39,950 --> 01:02:41,725
...look on your stupid face!

1468
01:02:41,819 --> 01:02:43,307
What's wrong with me?

1469
01:02:43,387 --> 01:02:45,043
Don't fucking look at her. Turn around.

1470
01:02:45,123 --> 01:02:46,511
Everybody get the fuck out of here.

1471
01:02:46,591 --> 01:02:47,934
Fuck you, Luke.

1472
01:02:48,293 --> 01:02:51,064
I'm just gonna have
a little lie down, okay?

1473
01:03:02,841 --> 01:03:04,013
Hi!

1474
01:03:04,175 --> 01:03:05,597
- Hi!
- Hi!

1475
01:03:05,677 --> 01:03:07,799
Did you need to
take a little breather, too?

1476
01:03:07,879 --> 01:03:09,381
No. Why? Are you?

1477
01:03:10,247 --> 01:03:11,569
Well...

1478
01:03:11,649 --> 01:03:15,006
You know, you think that
every moment is going to feel...

1479
01:03:15,086 --> 01:03:17,375
warm and glowy...

1480
01:03:17,455 --> 01:03:19,277
and absolutely magical.

1481
01:03:19,357 --> 01:03:22,304
But, then, some stuff happens.

1482
01:03:23,294 --> 01:03:24,867
- Sure does.
- Yeah.

1483
01:03:26,866 --> 01:03:30,075
Well, if you want
warm, glowy and magical...

1484
01:03:30,936 --> 01:03:32,006
I have just the thing.

1485
01:03:32,638 --> 01:03:33,810
I don't leave home without it.

1486
01:03:36,642 --> 01:03:38,197
- Ecstasy.
- Oh!

1487
01:03:38,277 --> 01:03:40,900
Every bride deserves to have a little fun
the night before her wedding!

1488
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:42,960
Yeah. I deserve to have a little fun.

1489
01:03:44,183 --> 01:03:45,924
You are so nice to me.

1490
01:03:46,151 --> 01:03:47,152
Aww.

1491
01:03:50,189 --> 01:03:51,845
This is gonna be so much fun!

1492
01:03:51,925 --> 01:03:54,860
- We should find something to suck on.
- What? Oh.

1493
01:03:55,227 --> 01:03:57,567
- Mike!
- Here. Put these on.

1494
01:03:58,063 --> 01:03:59,235
- We need headsets?
- Yeah!

1495
01:03:59,598 --> 01:04:01,887
There's a lot of dancing
in our speech, my man. Right?

1496
01:04:01,967 --> 01:04:03,156
Gotta go hands free.

1497
01:04:03,236 --> 01:04:04,791
This is how we do it, baby.

1498
01:04:04,871 --> 01:04:06,893
Come on. Hey, check this out.

1499
01:04:06,973 --> 01:04:09,029
I'm going to "wedding crash" cousin Terry.

1500
01:04:09,109 --> 01:04:10,163
What?

1501
01:04:10,243 --> 01:04:11,264
Put a few eye drops in her drink.

1502
01:04:11,344 --> 01:04:13,099
That way she shits all night,
and can't do the speech.

1503
01:04:13,179 --> 01:04:14,351
Just like in the movie Wedding Crashers.

1504
01:04:14,548 --> 01:04:16,269
Mike, that is a terrible idea.

1505
01:04:16,349 --> 01:04:18,605
- You've seen the movie!
- Of course I've seen the movie.

1506
01:04:18,685 --> 01:04:20,574
- You love that movie.
- Everyone loves that movie.

1507
01:04:20,654 --> 01:04:22,075
How's it a bad idea if you love the movie?

1508
01:04:22,155 --> 01:04:24,110
I love Taken.
I don't want to go steal little girls.

1509
01:04:24,190 --> 01:04:25,879
But we shouldn't wedding crash
our own cousin.

1510
01:04:25,959 --> 01:04:27,180
I'm worried about you, man.

1511
01:04:27,260 --> 01:04:29,137
I'm really worried
that you're losing your mind.

1512
01:04:29,262 --> 01:04:30,866
The look in your eyes right now...

1513
01:04:31,097 --> 01:04:33,053
You haven't blinked
since we've started talking.

1514
01:04:33,133 --> 01:04:34,578
Oh, Davie, Davie, Davie!

1515
01:04:34,801 --> 01:04:35,871
What?

1516
01:04:36,269 --> 01:04:38,875
I've never been in more control
in my entire life.

1517
01:04:42,126 --> 01:04:43,854
Mike!

1518
01:04:44,154 --> 01:04:45,309
Mike!

1519
01:04:45,409 --> 01:04:46,523
This is really intense.

1520
01:04:47,148 --> 01:04:48,769
Yeah, it's hitting me really hard.

1521
01:04:48,849 --> 01:04:50,726
This is good ecstasy.

1522
01:04:51,185 --> 01:04:52,994
I don't know. I wouldn't know.
It's my first time.

1523
01:04:53,187 --> 01:04:54,575
- Wait, what?
- What?

1524
01:04:54,655 --> 01:04:56,978
Why would you take ecstasy
for the first time

1525
01:04:57,058 --> 01:04:58,479
on the night before your wedding?

1526
01:04:58,559 --> 01:04:59,560
What?

1527
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:01,037
That is so baller!

1528
01:05:01,862 --> 01:05:03,739
Like a tiny blonde gangsta!

1529
01:05:03,864 --> 01:05:06,207
This little gangsta would kill
for a motherfucking ginger ale!

1530
01:05:07,368 --> 01:05:08,438
- Do you wanna go?
- Mmm-hmm.

1531
01:05:08,536 --> 01:05:09,991
Okay, let's go.

1532
01:05:10,071 --> 01:05:11,914
Hello, everyone. Please take your seats.

1533
01:05:12,306 --> 01:05:16,615
Welcome to the rehearsal dinner
for my man, Eric...

1534
01:05:16,711 --> 01:05:19,055
and his bride-to-be, the lovely Jeanie.

1535
01:05:19,146 --> 01:05:22,060
They're two of the sweetest, best people
I ever met.

1536
01:05:22,184 --> 01:05:24,460
All right. Our first speaker tonight...

1537
01:05:24,553 --> 01:05:26,341
is resident nasty girl...

1538
01:05:26,421 --> 01:05:28,559
Cousin Terry.

1539
01:05:28,957 --> 01:05:30,493
We can't let Terry crush.

1540
01:05:30,792 --> 01:05:31,847
It's not fair!

1541
01:05:31,927 --> 01:05:33,133
No. Give it to me.

1542
01:05:33,228 --> 01:05:34,935
My eyes are dry. Just give it to me.

1543
01:05:35,330 --> 01:05:36,934
Do you guys know who Chris Rock is?

1544
01:05:37,499 --> 01:05:40,537
He's my neighbor, and he helped me out
with a little something I like to call...

1545
01:05:40,802 --> 01:05:42,157
"My speech."

1546
01:05:42,237 --> 01:05:44,860
Stop. You're wasting it.
You're wasting the poison.

1547
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:46,061
Mike, this is baby safe.

1548
01:05:46,141 --> 01:05:49,097
They removed the active ingredient,
Tetrahydrozoline, like 20 years ago!

1549
01:05:49,177 --> 01:05:50,399
It worked on Wedding Crashers!

1550
01:05:50,479 --> 01:05:52,000
That was not real life!

1551
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:54,686
Now let's talk about destination weddings!

1552
01:05:55,350 --> 01:05:56,805
It's like a vacation...

1553
01:05:56,885 --> 01:05:58,728
without the relaxation!

1554
01:06:00,423 --> 01:06:01,578
That's true.

1555
01:06:01,658 --> 01:06:02,659
Why aren't you on my side, Dave?

1556
01:06:03,092 --> 01:06:04,113
What?

1557
01:06:04,193 --> 01:06:06,605
I'm done with this shit, man.
I'm not doing our stupid speech.

1558
01:06:06,829 --> 01:06:09,018
In fact, I'm quitting our liquor business.

1559
01:06:09,098 --> 01:06:10,202
There it is!

1560
01:06:10,433 --> 01:06:11,503
- Really?
- Yeah.

1561
01:06:11,601 --> 01:06:12,705
And what are you gonna do?

1562
01:06:12,835 --> 01:06:14,190
I'm gonna draw!

1563
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:17,393
I'm gonna work on my graphic novel,
and Mom's gonna help me cover the rent.

1564
01:06:17,473 --> 01:06:18,543
Boom!

1565
01:06:18,741 --> 01:06:19,762
You traitor!

1566
01:06:19,842 --> 01:06:20,877
I ain't gotta rehearse!

1567
01:06:21,411 --> 01:06:24,219
I know how to eat dinner.

1568
01:06:26,382 --> 01:06:27,417
Keith, can you turn me up a little bit?

1569
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:31,329
You turn your back on me
when everyone else does.

1570
01:06:31,554 --> 01:06:34,562
Backstabbing, treacherous lying coward!

1571
01:06:34,791 --> 01:06:36,045
Ooh, I don't think they know they're on.

1572
01:06:36,125 --> 01:06:37,536
What? Where is that coming from?

1573
01:06:37,894 --> 01:06:39,134
I don't know what I did!

1574
01:06:39,228 --> 01:06:40,551
It doesn't matter, Mike.

1575
01:06:40,631 --> 01:06:42,042
You're losing your mind.

1576
01:06:42,232 --> 01:06:44,178
You just tried to poison our cousin Terry!

1577
01:06:45,536 --> 01:06:46,757
Try a little harder. Am I right?

1578
01:06:46,837 --> 01:06:47,992
You're goddamn right I did.

1579
01:06:48,072 --> 01:06:51,110
Because I wanted her to shit
hot brown poop all over that stage.

1580
01:06:52,009 --> 01:06:53,364
That is unacceptable.

1581
01:06:53,444 --> 01:06:55,299
The mics are on, boys.

1582
01:06:55,379 --> 01:06:58,268
I wanted her butt to explode
like a rotten cantaloupe.

1583
01:06:58,348 --> 01:06:59,536
The mics are on!

1584
01:06:59,616 --> 01:07:02,688
You're just fucking pissed off
because Tatiana finger diddled Terry.

1585
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:05,561
There it is!

1586
01:07:05,823 --> 01:07:07,693
It was for tickets to Rihanna.

1587
01:07:07,825 --> 01:07:09,736
You're sad, man. You are sad.

1588
01:07:10,127 --> 01:07:12,733
I'm gonna kick your ass
just like when we were kids.

1589
01:07:17,301 --> 01:07:18,576
- Oh!
- My God!

1590
01:07:20,805 --> 01:07:22,060
- Do you wanna go?
- Don't do it!

1591
01:07:22,140 --> 01:07:23,361
These are coming your way.

1592
01:07:23,441 --> 01:07:24,776
Just stop!

1593
01:07:25,610 --> 01:07:27,283
God! That had to hurt.

1594
01:07:27,612 --> 01:07:28,920
Don't do it again.

1595
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:30,381
Oh!

1596
01:07:32,650 --> 01:07:33,872
Why do you keep punching me?

1597
01:07:33,952 --> 01:07:35,363
Why do you keep rushing at me?

1598
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:36,692
Get him, Dave.

1599
01:07:36,788 --> 01:07:37,909
Oops, who said that?

1600
01:07:37,989 --> 01:07:39,627
This wedding is going to hell!

1601
01:07:39,724 --> 01:07:40,879
Yes.

1602
01:07:40,959 --> 01:07:43,064
They're out there,
smiling like fucking idiots.

1603
01:07:43,628 --> 01:07:45,801
And they don't realize the bride...

1604
01:07:45,964 --> 01:07:47,886
is getting off at massage parlors...

1605
01:07:47,966 --> 01:07:50,275
like a goddamn Vietnam War veteran.

1606
01:07:51,836 --> 01:07:54,359
I think they misunderstood what happened.
I think they just misunderstood.

1607
01:07:54,439 --> 01:07:56,561
I walked in and saw little Jeanie...

1608
01:07:56,641 --> 01:07:58,431
the bride-to-be, orgasming.

1609
01:07:58,511 --> 01:08:00,900
The masseuse got her off.

1610
01:08:00,980 --> 01:08:02,334
God damn it!

1611
01:08:02,414 --> 01:08:03,484
Jeanie!

1612
01:08:03,916 --> 01:08:04,917
I hate you!

1613
01:08:18,998 --> 01:08:20,807
The rehearsal dinner is over.

1614
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:24,504
Drinks by the pool, everybody.
Drinks by the pool.

1615
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:30,677
Everything feels so good, right?

1616
01:08:30,810 --> 01:08:31,811
Yep.

1617
01:08:32,211 --> 01:08:33,733
You know what
I've been thinking about a lot?

1618
01:08:33,813 --> 01:08:34,883
Tell me.

1619
01:08:34,980 --> 01:08:36,903
Eric is so sweet and sensitive.

1620
01:08:36,983 --> 01:08:39,005
Kind, good, fiancé.

1621
01:08:39,085 --> 01:08:40,621
Probably great husband and stuff, but...

1622
01:08:41,721 --> 01:08:43,510
Do you think Eric is boring?

1623
01:08:43,590 --> 01:08:44,644
Boring?

1624
01:08:44,724 --> 01:08:45,896
Like for my honeymoon...

1625
01:08:46,326 --> 01:08:48,448
all I wanted to do
was go on a hot air balloon...

1626
01:08:48,528 --> 01:08:50,303
to different countries around the world.

1627
01:08:50,463 --> 01:08:52,652
And just be surrounded by wicker.

1628
01:08:52,732 --> 01:08:54,221
We could have wicker picnic baskets...

1629
01:08:54,301 --> 01:08:56,838
and I could make picnic hats
out of wicker.

1630
01:08:57,070 --> 01:08:59,059
We would be wearing
matching Chuck Taylors.

1631
01:08:59,139 --> 01:09:00,982
- And he vetoed it.
- Oh!

1632
01:09:01,408 --> 01:09:03,786
Because he wants to go to a resort,
and just...

1633
01:09:05,879 --> 01:09:07,434
- ...perch.
- What?

1634
01:09:07,514 --> 01:09:08,602
I am a young woman...

1635
01:09:08,682 --> 01:09:10,937
- Preach!
- There is so much for me to see.

1636
01:09:11,017 --> 01:09:13,327
- Yes.
- I haven't even been to Burning Man.

1637
01:09:13,787 --> 01:09:15,994
I don't even know what Amsterdam is like.

1638
01:09:16,524 --> 01:09:18,094
I haven't been to Seattle.

1639
01:09:18,226 --> 01:09:19,480
You've never been to Seattle?

1640
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:20,581
No!

1641
01:09:20,661 --> 01:09:23,039
- Seattle's gonna change your fucking life!
- Really?

1642
01:09:23,130 --> 01:09:24,352
You need to get out of this cage!

1643
01:09:24,432 --> 01:09:25,486
I am in a cage...

1644
01:09:25,566 --> 01:09:28,046
just like these horses are caged.

1645
01:09:28,236 --> 01:09:30,113
Just let them out.

1646
01:09:30,304 --> 01:09:31,305
Huh?

1647
01:09:32,773 --> 01:09:33,877
Let them all out.

1648
01:09:40,281 --> 01:09:42,904
Be free! No one can hold you down!

1649
01:09:42,984 --> 01:09:46,124
Be free, my friends! Follow your dreams!

1650
01:10:11,713 --> 01:10:12,953
Here to pile on?

1651
01:10:13,315 --> 01:10:14,316
Go ahead.

1652
01:10:14,416 --> 01:10:15,704
Any insult you can think of...

1653
01:10:15,784 --> 01:10:17,286
I've probably told myself a million times.

1654
01:10:17,419 --> 01:10:19,092
Why were you trying to poison your cousin?

1655
01:10:21,290 --> 01:10:26,515
I was jealous of the whole
steam room incident.

1656
01:10:26,595 --> 01:10:29,405
That is some crazy shit.
That's like something I would do.

1657
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:31,253
This one time in high school...

1658
01:10:31,333 --> 01:10:32,821
this bitch tried to hit on my boyfriend...

1659
01:10:32,901 --> 01:10:34,490
and I cut off her ponytail
while she was sleeping...

1660
01:10:34,570 --> 01:10:36,025
and I wore it to school for a month.

1661
01:10:36,105 --> 01:10:37,227
What the fuck?

1662
01:10:37,307 --> 01:10:38,843
But you tried to poison your cousin.

1663
01:10:52,322 --> 01:10:55,303
Look. I'm sorry I've been so rough
on you, okay?

1664
01:10:55,525 --> 01:10:59,234
I honestly think it's
because you're so much like me.

1665
01:10:59,462 --> 01:11:01,417
You act all confident...

1666
01:11:01,497 --> 01:11:04,501
but, inside, you're scared of everything.

1667
01:11:04,734 --> 01:11:06,441
You act like you don't care
what people think...

1668
01:11:06,536 --> 01:11:08,106
but you really care what people think.

1669
01:11:08,204 --> 01:11:09,425
And you try to act so smart...

1670
01:11:09,505 --> 01:11:11,127
but sometimes...

1671
01:11:11,207 --> 01:11:14,417
you're just afraid
you're the dumbest person in the world.

1672
01:11:17,181 --> 01:11:18,785
I'm so dumb.

1673
01:11:19,283 --> 01:11:22,753
I'm constantly saying words
that I don't know the meaning of.

1674
01:11:23,420 --> 01:11:25,764
Like, I use this word, "assuage"...

1675
01:11:26,023 --> 01:11:27,400
all the time.

1676
01:11:27,691 --> 01:11:29,637
Can you assuage me the ketchup?

1677
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,671
Can I assuage you a few questions?

1678
01:11:31,862 --> 01:11:34,672
- Is that the meaning of it?
- I don't know.

1679
01:11:34,765 --> 01:11:36,220
But it's like, I'm so stupid...

1680
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:38,555
but I act all confident,
so people listen to me.

1681
01:11:38,635 --> 01:11:39,705
And it's fucked up.

1682
01:11:39,903 --> 01:11:41,814
Me, too. I'm a natural born leader.

1683
01:11:42,039 --> 01:11:43,794
Like George Washington.

1684
01:11:43,874 --> 01:11:44,962
Yeah.

1685
01:11:45,042 --> 01:11:46,282
Or another leader.

1686
01:11:53,852 --> 01:11:55,240
All right, here's one.

1687
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:57,391
But I'm about to get super real
with you. Okay?

1688
01:11:58,857 --> 01:12:02,498
I thought I was destined
for such great things...

1689
01:12:02,594 --> 01:12:05,268
but I may never achieve anything.

1690
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:10,040
Sister.

1691
01:12:11,403 --> 01:12:13,314
Have you been reading my diary?

1692
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:23,415
Yes.

1693
01:12:24,382 --> 01:12:25,486
Okay.

1694
01:12:37,963 --> 01:12:39,251
You are beautiful!

1695
01:12:39,331 --> 01:12:40,708
On to Seattle!

1696
01:12:40,866 --> 01:12:41,970
Alice?

1697
01:12:43,002 --> 01:12:44,003
Am I glowing?

1698
01:12:44,270 --> 01:12:46,343
I can see sounds and hear colors.

1699
01:12:46,438 --> 01:12:47,776
Be free!

1700
01:12:47,940 --> 01:12:49,544
What the fuck are the horses doing out?

1701
01:12:50,476 --> 01:12:51,887
Who the fuck are you guys?

1702
01:12:52,144 --> 01:12:53,350
Fucking gypsies!

1703
01:12:53,512 --> 01:12:55,651
Francisco! Francisco, run!

1704
01:12:56,048 --> 01:12:57,994
Whoa! Shit!

1705
01:13:00,820 --> 01:13:01,874
Hey.

1706
01:13:01,954 --> 01:13:03,524
Dave! Hi.

1707
01:13:05,157 --> 01:13:06,479
What's up? What's up with you?

1708
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:08,835
- What's going on? Are you okay?
- Me?

1709
01:13:08,994 --> 01:13:11,134
Yeah. I'm fine.

1710
01:13:12,899 --> 01:13:14,344
Oh. Yeah. Well...

1711
01:13:14,901 --> 01:13:16,676
Yeah. See, what happened was that...

1712
01:13:16,837 --> 01:13:19,159
there was a tsunami,
and it took away our clothes...

1713
01:13:19,239 --> 01:13:20,460
but it brought these horses.

1714
01:13:20,540 --> 01:13:21,528
What?

1715
01:13:21,608 --> 01:13:23,830
And then, we wanted to get naked
because of Lady Godiva...

1716
01:13:23,910 --> 01:13:25,685
but then horses can't eat chocolate.

1717
01:13:25,846 --> 01:13:27,826
They could have an aneurysm.

1718
01:13:27,981 --> 01:13:29,187
Where's Jeanie?

1719
01:13:29,282 --> 01:13:30,637
Hey, don't yell at her
just because she's the one...

1720
01:13:30,717 --> 01:13:32,305
- that told me to go to Seattle.
- Holy shit!

1721
01:13:32,385 --> 01:13:34,041
- I've always wanted to go!
- Oh, my God!

1722
01:13:34,121 --> 01:13:35,909
That is not her fault.

1723
01:13:35,989 --> 01:13:37,434
- Oh, my eyes!
- What's the matter?

1724
01:13:37,591 --> 01:13:39,179
Stop yelling. Why are you yelling?
David, stop yelling.

1725
01:13:39,259 --> 01:13:40,897
You're being loud. And this a happy time.

1726
01:13:41,061 --> 01:13:42,404
This a really good time.

1727
01:13:42,562 --> 01:13:43,717
There's nothing wrong. So who's at fault?

1728
01:13:43,797 --> 01:13:46,175
Did you know that Hitler's parents
were second cousins?

1729
01:13:46,366 --> 01:13:47,902
- Do you have any water?
- Put your clothes on!

1730
01:13:48,068 --> 01:13:51,276
I'm a woman, Dave. Deal with it.

1731
01:13:51,506 --> 01:13:55,215
Because this is the bush
that you came out of.

1732
01:13:55,376 --> 01:13:56,719
I didn't come from that bush.

1733
01:13:56,878 --> 01:13:58,585
I came from Mom's bush. And you know that.

1734
01:13:58,746 --> 01:14:00,191
Jeanie! Oh, my God!

1735
01:14:00,681 --> 01:14:02,058
You're completely naked!

1736
01:14:02,216 --> 01:14:04,560
- Hi, Becky!
- God, your bush is huge.

1737
01:14:04,719 --> 01:14:06,426
- You look tall.
- No, ma'am.

1738
01:14:06,587 --> 01:14:08,999
I told you to stay away
from these bitches.

1739
01:14:09,257 --> 01:14:11,396
Alice, seriously, are you tripping?

1740
01:14:11,559 --> 01:14:12,547
No. God, no.

1741
01:14:12,627 --> 01:14:14,800
Why would say that?
Just because everything feels really soft?

1742
01:14:15,096 --> 01:14:16,700
Please. Just tell me the truth.

1743
01:14:16,864 --> 01:14:17,934
Are you on drugs?

1744
01:14:18,766 --> 01:14:20,211
We're super fucked up. Yeah.

1745
01:14:20,368 --> 01:14:21,389
What?

1746
01:14:21,469 --> 01:14:23,881
We started with ecstasy,
but then I went into my mystery bags.

1747
01:14:24,038 --> 01:14:25,415
Why the fuck would you do that?

1748
01:14:25,573 --> 01:14:26,794
Don't you judge me, David.

1749
01:14:26,874 --> 01:14:28,629
I don't think you're supposed to
go into the mystery bag...

1750
01:14:28,709 --> 01:14:29,780
the night before the wedding.

1751
01:14:29,945 --> 01:14:32,084
We brought you here
because we thought you were nice girls.

1752
01:14:32,247 --> 01:14:34,090
But Mike was right about you two.

1753
01:14:34,249 --> 01:14:36,490
This whole wedding weekend
is just going to shit!

1754
01:14:36,652 --> 01:14:38,461
Dave, I'll be honest with you.

1755
01:14:38,620 --> 01:14:39,758
I need some clothes.

1756
01:14:40,789 --> 01:14:42,268
I can't continue to wear this horse.

1757
01:14:42,424 --> 01:14:43,960
Oh, my God.

1758
01:14:44,493 --> 01:14:45,801
Oh, the wind feels so nice.

1759
01:14:45,961 --> 01:14:47,835
Come on, come on, come on.

1760
01:14:49,197 --> 01:14:53,088
We should go in the ocean. I'm so thirsty!
Dave, we should get in the ocean.

1761
01:14:53,168 --> 01:14:56,325
Please, please, please, just be quiet.

1762
01:14:56,405 --> 01:14:57,893
I love this song.

1763
01:14:57,973 --> 01:14:59,316
There's no music playing.

1764
01:15:00,442 --> 01:15:01,443
Baby, wait.

1765
01:15:01,610 --> 01:15:03,521
Don't worry. Only our butts touched.

1766
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:05,625
Stop it. Don't freak out anymore, Pumpkin!

1767
01:15:05,781 --> 01:15:07,818
Don't freak out? Don't freak out?

1768
01:15:08,016 --> 01:15:09,360
Tell me one thing.

1769
01:15:09,586 --> 01:15:10,792
Did you enjoy it?

1770
01:15:11,354 --> 01:15:12,958
No.

1771
01:15:13,923 --> 01:15:15,311
That is such a "yes" no.

1772
01:15:15,391 --> 01:15:16,446
No.

1773
01:15:16,526 --> 01:15:18,915
I'm gonna ask you again. Did you enjoy it?

1774
01:15:18,995 --> 01:15:19,983
Yes! Oh.

1775
01:15:20,063 --> 01:15:21,098
Well...

1776
01:15:21,364 --> 01:15:22,934
Cat's out of the frigging bag, isn't it?

1777
01:15:23,099 --> 01:15:25,010
I went for a normal massage...

1778
01:15:25,168 --> 01:15:27,205
but Alice, she had asked
for a little special treat.

1779
01:15:27,370 --> 01:15:29,281
And then it just kept coming,
and coming, and coming, and...

1780
01:15:29,439 --> 01:15:31,544
Who are these fucking girls
your brothers brought to this wedding?

1781
01:15:31,975 --> 01:15:34,512
You are clearly on drugs.

1782
01:15:34,677 --> 01:15:36,156
And we're getting married tomorrow!

1783
01:15:36,980 --> 01:15:38,823
I'm scared, Pumpkin.

1784
01:15:38,982 --> 01:15:40,222
Aren't you scared?

1785
01:15:40,383 --> 01:15:42,192
Well, yeah, now I am.

1786
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:44,027
It's just that...

1787
01:15:44,721 --> 01:15:49,171
I'm just a little worried that you are...

1788
01:15:50,694 --> 01:15:51,695
boring.

1789
01:15:53,230 --> 01:15:54,573
What are you saying?

1790
01:15:54,732 --> 01:15:55,938
You don't want to marry me?

1791
01:16:06,810 --> 01:16:08,084
Well...

1792
01:16:08,245 --> 01:16:09,849
No, she doesn't mean that.
She's just confused...

1793
01:16:10,014 --> 01:16:11,254
because she's just rolling
super hard right now.

1794
01:16:11,415 --> 01:16:12,519
You rolled her!

1795
01:16:12,683 --> 01:16:14,754
- You're the roller!
- I'm so sorry.

1796
01:16:14,918 --> 01:16:17,330
I was gonna draw Rum for you.
But not anymore.

1797
01:16:17,488 --> 01:16:19,468
Everything is not irie, man!

1798
01:16:21,892 --> 01:16:24,498
You've made me so, so sad.

1799
01:16:27,065 --> 01:16:28,442
But a little bit mad.

1800
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:30,611
But mostly just sad.

1801
01:16:31,603 --> 01:16:32,604
Oh!

1802
01:16:34,572 --> 01:16:35,880
- Dad!
- Don't!

1803
01:16:36,041 --> 01:16:37,452
Mike, for once in your life...

1804
01:16:37,609 --> 01:16:40,590
please don't say a fucking word.

1805
01:17:05,036 --> 01:17:06,812
I hate them sometimes.

1806
01:17:06,972 --> 01:17:08,227
Fucking love them and they're dicks.

1807
01:17:08,307 --> 01:17:10,048
Sometimes I love them,
sometimes I hate them.

1808
01:17:18,117 --> 01:17:19,118
Everything okay over there?

1809
01:17:19,285 --> 01:17:21,697
I can't find my other sock.
It's pissing me off.

1810
01:17:24,590 --> 01:17:26,331
Did you take my sock, bro?

1811
01:17:26,492 --> 01:17:27,562
No.

1812
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:30,438
I think you took my fucking sock, bro.

1813
01:17:32,064 --> 01:17:33,134
God damn it.

1814
01:17:33,265 --> 01:17:35,370
I can't believe Jeanie and Eric
aren't getting married...

1815
01:17:35,501 --> 01:17:37,310
and it's all our fault.

1816
01:17:37,970 --> 01:17:40,951
It's slightly our fault.

1817
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:43,853
It's totally our fault. Fuck.

1818
01:17:44,009 --> 01:17:46,354
We got selfish. We got distracted.

1819
01:17:47,948 --> 01:17:50,758
I don't think we were
#DoingltForJeanie at all.

1820
01:17:50,917 --> 01:17:52,794
We weren't #DoingltForJeanie.

1821
01:17:52,953 --> 01:17:55,797
Our fucking little sister.
Our little Jeanie Beanie Weanie.

1822
01:17:56,456 --> 01:17:58,333
She is Stanglita.

1823
01:17:58,492 --> 01:18:01,268
The one little girl
we used to let into our Stang Hangs.

1824
01:18:01,428 --> 01:18:02,416
The Stangle Dangle.

1825
01:18:02,496 --> 01:18:04,032
The smallest plane in the Stangar.

1826
01:18:04,197 --> 01:18:05,335
Don't do it, dude.

1827
01:18:05,499 --> 01:18:06,807
We're supposed to be her protector.

1828
01:18:06,967 --> 01:18:08,503
Don't you cry.

1829
01:18:08,668 --> 01:18:09,669
We're supposed to look out for her.

1830
01:18:09,836 --> 01:18:11,008
Stop it.

1831
01:18:11,171 --> 01:18:14,118
We're supposed to be the two dudes
that have her back no matter what.

1832
01:18:14,274 --> 01:18:15,719
If you start, I'm gonna start.

1833
01:18:15,876 --> 01:18:18,152
We broke up her marriage.

1834
01:18:20,947 --> 01:18:23,860
Of course I'm fucking doing it, man.
We ruined Jeanie's wedding.

1835
01:18:24,017 --> 01:18:25,463
I'm doing it, too.

1836
01:18:26,020 --> 01:18:27,197
I hate it.

1837
01:18:40,067 --> 01:18:42,690
Oh, man, we fucked up this wedding.

1838
01:18:42,770 --> 01:18:43,771
Yeah.

1839
01:18:43,938 --> 01:18:46,111
We fucked it in the dick.

1840
01:18:47,442 --> 01:18:49,097
You know I don't like it when you say that.
That's just...

1841
01:18:49,177 --> 01:18:51,885
I know, but we fucked it so hard. Fuck.

1842
01:18:51,979 --> 01:18:55,136
I think the reason we get ourselves
into so much shit is...

1843
01:18:55,216 --> 01:18:57,287
we're always telling each other
we're so awesome...

1844
01:18:57,552 --> 01:19:00,556
when we're definitely not being awesome.

1845
01:19:00,721 --> 01:19:02,029
That's deep.

1846
01:19:02,190 --> 01:19:04,000
Yeah, you know what? Um...

1847
01:19:05,594 --> 01:19:07,437
I wanted you to feel better...

1848
01:19:07,596 --> 01:19:09,769
and get your groove back...

1849
01:19:09,932 --> 01:19:13,072
but not all the way better to where...

1850
01:19:14,503 --> 01:19:16,505
you wouldn't need me anymore.

1851
01:19:16,672 --> 01:19:19,585
Because if you don't need me...

1852
01:19:21,076 --> 01:19:23,750
then nobody needs me, and, um...

1853
01:19:24,413 --> 01:19:27,690
Anyway, that's what I was thinking
when I was knuckles deep into Cousin Terry.

1854
01:19:28,350 --> 01:19:30,296
Dude, we're always gonna need each other.

1855
01:19:30,919 --> 01:19:31,920
Okay.

1856
01:19:32,187 --> 01:19:36,230
Okay, here's the thing.
I don't wanna stop being us.

1857
01:19:36,391 --> 01:19:38,462
But I think occasionally...

1858
01:19:38,627 --> 01:19:42,872
we should think about
how we make other people feel.

1859
01:19:45,168 --> 01:19:46,156
Like Jeanie?

1860
01:19:46,236 --> 01:19:47,442
Yeah, like Jeanie.

1861
01:19:47,904 --> 01:19:49,611
- Oof.
- Or like Eric.

1862
01:19:50,073 --> 01:19:51,108
Oh, fuck.

1863
01:19:51,274 --> 01:19:52,912
This feels fucking terrible.

1864
01:19:53,076 --> 01:19:55,283
This does not feel good.

1865
01:19:55,478 --> 01:19:58,220
Like, Dave's so special and...

1866
01:19:58,948 --> 01:20:01,326
He must be so mad at me.

1867
01:20:01,751 --> 01:20:02,821
Poor Mike.

1868
01:20:02,986 --> 01:20:06,331
He's less special,
but I played him so hard.

1869
01:20:06,489 --> 01:20:07,934
They must be so mad at us!

1870
01:20:08,091 --> 01:20:10,298
They must hate us. Fuck! I would hate us.

1871
01:20:10,460 --> 01:20:12,269
I would fucking hate us!

1872
01:20:12,428 --> 01:20:14,772
I hate us, man. I hate us!

1873
01:20:14,931 --> 01:20:16,069
I hate us, too!

1874
01:20:16,232 --> 01:20:17,939
But you're the best, dude. I love you.

1875
01:20:18,101 --> 01:20:20,445
Don't lump yourself in with me.

1876
01:20:20,603 --> 01:20:22,083
I'm like a little troll...

1877
01:20:22,239 --> 01:20:25,015
who lives on nothing but
river water and squirrel meats.

1878
01:20:25,175 --> 01:20:27,587
Your drawing?
I could never do anything like that.

1879
01:20:27,745 --> 01:20:29,934
- So go. You go right now.
- What?

1880
01:20:30,014 --> 01:20:31,068
Go!

1881
01:20:31,148 --> 01:20:34,527
Don't let your loser older brother
hold you back.

1882
01:20:37,988 --> 01:20:39,331
You are not a loser.

1883
01:20:40,157 --> 01:20:41,659
Thanks, Dave.

1884
01:20:41,825 --> 01:20:43,327
Dude, you introduced me
to the Ninja Turtles.

1885
01:20:43,494 --> 01:20:45,337
Taught me Donatello was a pussy.

1886
01:20:45,496 --> 01:20:47,373
That Raphael was actually dope...

1887
01:20:47,531 --> 01:20:49,511
because he didn't give a fuck
what people thought.

1888
01:20:49,667 --> 01:20:50,941
He's cool, but rude.

1889
01:20:51,101 --> 01:20:52,341
Exactly.

1890
01:20:52,436 --> 01:20:54,541
When all those kids kicked at me
and they called me "Moist"...

1891
01:20:54,638 --> 01:20:57,517
you stopped eating muffins
at the school lunch for a year.

1892
01:20:57,675 --> 01:20:59,348
They were too moist.

1893
01:21:00,477 --> 01:21:02,389
Made you an easy target.

1894
01:21:02,547 --> 01:21:06,051
You're my brother. And I love you.

1895
01:21:06,217 --> 01:21:07,787
Heroes in a half shell.

1896
01:21:07,953 --> 01:21:09,057
Turtle power.

1897
01:21:14,125 --> 01:21:16,332
We're not going anywhere...

1898
01:21:16,494 --> 01:21:20,169
until our little sister,
Jeanie Beanie Weanie...

1899
01:21:20,332 --> 01:21:22,039
is getting married.

1900
01:21:27,739 --> 01:21:28,979
You just killed the TV.

1901
01:21:29,507 --> 01:21:31,248
I was aiming for it.

1902
01:21:33,712 --> 01:21:36,522
We are such idiots. We are so stupid.

1903
01:21:36,681 --> 01:21:38,183
We ruined your whole wedding...

1904
01:21:38,350 --> 01:21:40,058
and we finally just realized that.

1905
01:21:40,219 --> 01:21:42,199
All right. Please just stop talking, okay?

1906
01:21:42,355 --> 01:21:45,529
Not another word. My head hurts so bad.

1907
01:21:45,691 --> 01:21:46,897
Jeanie, Eric.

1908
01:21:47,059 --> 01:21:49,767
We can't let you not get married
just because we fucked everything up.

1909
01:21:49,929 --> 01:21:51,067
We love you so much, Jeanie.

1910
01:21:51,163 --> 01:21:53,234
We love you, Eric.
We just want you guys to love each other.

1911
01:21:53,332 --> 01:21:54,833
- Just love each other.
- That's it.

1912
01:21:56,402 --> 01:21:57,676
Jeanie, Eric.

1913
01:21:57,837 --> 01:21:59,339
We can't let you not get married.

1914
01:21:59,505 --> 01:22:01,109
Yeah. Just because
we fucked everything up?

1915
01:22:01,273 --> 01:22:02,718
I mean, we want you guys
to love each other.

1916
01:22:02,875 --> 01:22:03,876
Love each other.

1917
01:22:05,044 --> 01:22:07,923
Okay. This is bizarre,
because we literally did that...

1918
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:09,457
...exact same thing.

1919
01:22:09,615 --> 01:22:11,253
We're even doing this hand motion.

1920
01:22:11,417 --> 01:22:12,589
Yeah, all that was ours.

1921
01:22:12,752 --> 01:22:14,789
The point is, this shit is all our fault.

1922
01:22:14,954 --> 01:22:16,592
No, it's our fault.

1923
01:22:16,756 --> 01:22:18,429
No, it's definitely our fault.

1924
01:22:18,591 --> 01:22:19,696
It is our fault for sure.

1925
01:22:19,860 --> 01:22:20,861
No, no, no. For real.

1926
01:22:21,028 --> 01:22:22,473
If anything, it's my fault.

1927
01:22:24,197 --> 01:22:25,801
Shh! Please stop.

1928
01:22:28,068 --> 01:22:32,175
Everyone shut the fuck up!

1929
01:22:32,839 --> 01:22:35,183
Jesus Hussein Christ.

1930
01:22:35,342 --> 01:22:37,288
God damn it!

1931
01:22:37,411 --> 01:22:39,687
Been trying to read this same paragraph...

1932
01:22:39,913 --> 01:22:41,201
for 20 minutes.

1933
01:22:41,281 --> 01:22:45,821
But you four fucking morons
keep on fucking with my shit.

1934
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:48,141
We've only been here for three minutes...

1935
01:22:48,221 --> 01:22:49,409
so those other 17 minutes...

1936
01:22:49,489 --> 01:22:50,677
- that's kind of on you...
- Mike!

1937
01:22:50,757 --> 01:22:52,012
I'm using hyperbole.

1938
01:22:52,092 --> 01:22:54,936
I don't know what that means,
and I think you know that I don't.

1939
01:22:55,062 --> 01:22:57,050
Mike, do me a favor. Shut the fuck up.

1940
01:22:57,130 --> 01:22:58,118
Go Eric.

1941
01:22:58,198 --> 01:22:59,253
Shut up too!

1942
01:22:59,333 --> 01:23:00,607
I mean, God damn it!

1943
01:23:00,768 --> 01:23:03,908
You're all self-absorbed,
barely-functioning...

1944
01:23:04,472 --> 01:23:05,712
codependent weirdos!

1945
01:23:06,874 --> 01:23:08,182
- Yeah.
- I know.

1946
01:23:08,276 --> 01:23:10,381
- That's pretty spot-on.
- We just figured that out.

1947
01:23:10,545 --> 01:23:13,301
- Those are not good qualities.
- We're gonna work on it.

1948
01:23:13,381 --> 01:23:15,370
- It's been a long time.
- It's been so many years.

1949
01:23:15,450 --> 01:23:17,054
We're both very confused.

1950
01:23:17,151 --> 01:23:19,256
No, no. You're not confused.

1951
01:23:19,353 --> 01:23:21,476
You're just coming down off MDMA.

1952
01:23:21,556 --> 01:23:23,035
Sorry. Which I gave you.

1953
01:23:23,191 --> 01:23:25,865
And Eric, you can't blame her
for anything she said last night.

1954
01:23:26,027 --> 01:23:28,803
I've done so much stupid shit on E.

1955
01:23:28,963 --> 01:23:31,534
I got so dehydrated that
I was drinking puddle water...

1956
01:23:31,699 --> 01:23:32,871
and I had to go to the hospital...

1957
01:23:33,034 --> 01:23:35,640
'cause puddles are really dirty.

1958
01:23:35,837 --> 01:23:37,291
One time I was on peyote...

1959
01:23:37,371 --> 01:23:39,628
and I signed up for a T-Mobile plan.

1960
01:23:39,708 --> 01:23:41,463
One time I got high.

1961
01:23:41,543 --> 01:23:44,046
I read the back of a shampoo bottle
for 13 hours.

1962
01:23:45,080 --> 01:23:46,235
Because it said "repeat."

1963
01:23:46,315 --> 01:23:47,851
- Rinse and repeat.
- I get it.

1964
01:23:47,950 --> 01:23:50,988
Jeanie, I know you think
that Eric can be boring...

1965
01:23:51,253 --> 01:23:53,859
Enough of this talk of boring!

1966
01:23:54,389 --> 01:23:55,444
Damn it!

1967
01:23:55,524 --> 01:23:59,734
Sixty percent of my investments
are in some pretty aggressive stocks.

1968
01:23:59,862 --> 01:24:03,241
I don't always look both ways
when I cross the street.

1969
01:24:03,398 --> 01:24:06,388
I've been known to have
a second glass of wine...

1970
01:24:06,468 --> 01:24:08,290
with my dinner, every now and then.

1971
01:24:08,370 --> 01:24:10,025
I once went to see a movie...

1972
01:24:10,105 --> 01:24:12,594
walked across the hallway,
saw a second movie.

1973
01:24:12,674 --> 01:24:13,982
Didn't pay till after.

1974
01:24:14,176 --> 01:24:15,348
Is that boring?

1975
01:24:15,844 --> 01:24:16,833
Is that boring?

1976
01:24:16,913 --> 01:24:18,068
- What'd you say?
- Yeah.

1977
01:24:18,148 --> 01:24:19,684
- You're right. We were wrong.
- That was pretty boring.

1978
01:24:20,116 --> 01:24:21,356
Well, how about this for boring?

1979
01:24:23,219 --> 01:24:24,960
Bam!

1980
01:24:25,454 --> 01:24:27,727
Two hot air balloon tickets
for our honeymoon.

1981
01:24:27,857 --> 01:24:29,112
I know you really wanted to go...

1982
01:24:29,192 --> 01:24:32,071
so I got these tickets a while ago
to surprise you.

1983
01:24:32,428 --> 01:24:34,271
Surprise.

1984
01:24:34,430 --> 01:24:36,535
Aww!

1985
01:24:36,766 --> 01:24:38,268
Baby, you're so afraid of heights.

1986
01:24:38,902 --> 01:24:41,348
- Baby, I'm fucking terrified of heights.
- Yeah.

1987
01:24:41,771 --> 01:24:43,893
But my biggest fear...

1988
01:24:43,973 --> 01:24:46,112
is to not be the husband that you deserve.

1989
01:24:47,410 --> 01:24:50,289
Baby, I'm sorry I fucked
so much of this up...

1990
01:24:50,980 --> 01:24:52,102
but I promise that masseuse...

1991
01:24:52,182 --> 01:24:54,170
He didn't touch my lavender juice box.

1992
01:24:54,250 --> 01:24:56,094
Oh God, baby. I love you.

1993
01:24:56,654 --> 01:24:58,395
And I know I want to marry you.

1994
01:24:58,722 --> 01:25:01,635
Today, if you'll still have me.

1995
01:25:02,126 --> 01:25:04,572
Babe, of course. Are you kidding me?

1996
01:25:08,032 --> 01:25:09,019
Kiss her.

1997
01:25:09,099 --> 01:25:10,942
Baby, I'm crazy about you.

1998
01:25:23,414 --> 01:25:24,415
Aww!

1999
01:25:25,149 --> 01:25:26,651
I want to marry you right now...

2000
01:25:26,817 --> 01:25:28,763
but, baby, we already canceled
all the vendors.

2001
01:25:29,253 --> 01:25:30,994
I don't think they're going to
let us get married here.

2002
01:25:32,556 --> 01:25:33,626
Leave that to us.

2003
01:25:35,093 --> 01:25:36,731
Leave that to all of us.

2004
01:25:38,063 --> 01:25:39,201
- Yeah!
- Let's go, Mike.

2005
01:25:39,831 --> 01:25:41,401
This way! Oh, fuck!

2006
01:25:41,833 --> 01:25:43,312
We'll actually just head around.

2007
01:25:43,568 --> 01:25:45,047
- Girl.
- I'm good.

2008
01:25:45,337 --> 01:25:46,792
So what part you like, brah?

2009
01:25:46,872 --> 01:25:49,027
- We need the whole pig.
- I can't give you a whole pig.

2010
01:25:49,107 --> 01:25:50,643
But we need to feed 100 people.

2011
01:25:51,109 --> 01:25:53,932
Could we please, please
have the wedding here?

2012
01:25:54,012 --> 01:25:56,049
For the last time, we're out of venues.

2013
01:25:56,181 --> 01:25:58,525
- Hold me back. Hold me back, please.
- What?

2014
01:25:58,783 --> 01:25:59,805
Give us a place!

2015
01:25:59,885 --> 01:26:01,660
Everybody out of the way!

2016
01:26:01,853 --> 01:26:03,508
It's hot. So hot!

2017
01:26:03,588 --> 01:26:05,090
- Out of the fucking way!
- I want my pig back!

2018
01:26:05,857 --> 01:26:07,646
What if I supplied all the liquor...

2019
01:26:07,726 --> 01:26:09,714
for every bar in this hotel...

2020
01:26:09,794 --> 01:26:12,384
at wholesale prices
for the next three years?

2021
01:26:12,464 --> 01:26:14,342
- Deal.
- Yes! Fuck yes!

2022
01:26:14,533 --> 01:26:15,807
I'll get you guys a venue.

2023
01:26:29,782 --> 01:26:30,783
Keith, get it together.

2024
01:26:31,117 --> 01:26:32,289
We need to move, move, move.

2025
01:26:32,518 --> 01:26:33,588
I'm doing my best.

2026
01:26:37,256 --> 01:26:38,360
Hell yeah!

2027
01:26:56,310 --> 01:26:58,887
And now... a reading...

2028
01:26:59,546 --> 01:27:01,685
from the children's book
that I got in the lobby.

2029
01:27:01,982 --> 01:27:03,620
- Oh.
- "Aloha moon.

2030
01:27:04,017 --> 01:27:05,690
"Aloha sea.

2031
01:27:05,852 --> 01:27:07,229
"Aloha you.

2032
01:27:07,854 --> 01:27:08,924
"Aloha me."

2033
01:27:09,222 --> 01:27:10,792
- I do.
- I do.

2034
01:27:10,991 --> 01:27:12,334
By the power vested in me...

2035
01:27:12,526 --> 01:27:16,064
by the website www.beyourowndeacon.com...

2036
01:27:16,997 --> 01:27:20,240
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

2037
01:27:20,534 --> 01:27:22,322
Those assholes kind of did it.

2038
01:27:22,402 --> 01:27:23,813
Yeah.

2039
01:27:24,137 --> 01:27:25,810
Those assholes kind of did.

2040
01:27:25,973 --> 01:27:27,160
You may kiss the bride.

2041
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:28,762
Okay. Kiss the bride.

2042
01:27:28,842 --> 01:27:29,980
Kiss the bride.

2043
01:27:37,318 --> 01:27:38,319
Yeah!

2044
01:27:50,732 --> 01:27:52,353
- You designed this?
- Yeah.

2045
01:27:52,433 --> 01:27:54,822
Insane. We're at a wedding,
it's in the shape of a heart.

2046
01:27:54,902 --> 01:27:56,457
That was a really good idea.

2047
01:27:56,537 --> 01:27:58,073
I have so many good ideas.

2048
01:27:58,339 --> 01:28:01,013
At my last job, I was on fire with ideas.

2049
01:28:01,109 --> 01:28:03,282
Huh? Actually, I need a new partner...

2050
01:28:03,611 --> 01:28:06,820
because Dave is bailing on me
to draw things.

2051
01:28:07,281 --> 01:28:08,783
Would you wanna...

2052
01:28:09,017 --> 01:28:10,462
maybe come work for me?

2053
01:28:10,785 --> 01:28:11,787
Really?

2054
01:28:12,054 --> 01:28:13,465
What do you know about liquor?

2055
01:28:13,922 --> 01:28:16,766
Um, only that it's delicious and I love it.

2056
01:28:16,892 --> 01:28:18,647
And those are
the two things you need to know.

2057
01:28:18,727 --> 01:28:22,004
- You are hired.
- Great. When do I start?

2058
01:28:22,197 --> 01:28:23,437
You can start right away...

2059
01:28:23,899 --> 01:28:26,345
but just know that there will be
some late nights.

2060
01:28:26,435 --> 01:28:28,108
Keep it in your pants, okay?

2061
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:29,972
If we're going to work together,
let's just...

2062
01:28:30,406 --> 01:28:31,942
keep it professional.

2063
01:28:32,541 --> 01:28:33,611
Okay.

2064
01:28:33,742 --> 01:28:35,998
- We'll keep it professional, then.
- Good.

2065
01:28:36,078 --> 01:28:37,066
- All right.
- Good.

2066
01:28:37,146 --> 01:28:38,167
- Okay.
- Okay.

2067
01:28:38,247 --> 01:28:39,234
- Okay.
- Yeah.

2068
01:28:39,314 --> 01:28:40,793
- Are you sure?
- I don't know.

2069
01:28:42,217 --> 01:28:43,321
What?

2070
01:28:44,953 --> 01:28:46,432
- What'd you say?
- What?

2071
01:28:46,955 --> 01:28:49,128
Love me tender

2072
01:28:49,792 --> 01:28:51,636
Love me sweet

2073
01:28:53,630 --> 01:28:55,041
Never let me go

2074
01:28:59,135 --> 01:29:03,208
You have made my life complete

2075
01:29:07,310 --> 01:29:08,311
I don't.

2076
01:29:11,548 --> 01:29:13,357
Love me tender

2077
01:29:14,217 --> 01:29:15,821
Love me true

2078
01:29:17,854 --> 01:29:20,733
All my dreams fulfilled

2079
01:29:24,694 --> 01:29:28,005
For my darlin' I love you

2080
01:29:28,298 --> 01:29:30,108
Tatiana said this was gonna happen.

2081
01:29:30,367 --> 01:29:31,455
You got my groove back.

2082
01:29:31,535 --> 01:29:32,556
Really?

2083
01:29:32,636 --> 01:29:34,445
That's the sweetest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

2084
01:29:41,445 --> 01:29:42,515
I like you.

2085
01:29:49,687 --> 01:29:51,042
Wait. There's people everywhere.

2086
01:29:51,122 --> 01:29:53,193
- Let them watch.
- Mmm. Okay.

2087
01:29:55,526 --> 01:29:56,561
Whoa!

2088
01:29:57,094 --> 01:29:58,816
Hi, everyone.

2089
01:29:58,896 --> 01:30:01,308
Excuse us. Could we have
your attention, please?

2090
01:30:02,700 --> 01:30:04,822
My husband and I...

2091
01:30:04,902 --> 01:30:08,626
want to thank
four very incredible people...

2092
01:30:08,706 --> 01:30:10,482
for saving the day.

2093
01:30:10,775 --> 01:30:14,154
Mike and Dave have asked
to say a few words...

2094
01:30:14,412 --> 01:30:16,201
so we would like to invite them up.

2095
01:30:16,281 --> 01:30:17,316
Come on, boys.

2096
01:30:19,084 --> 01:30:20,085
Thank you, Jeanie.

2097
01:30:20,719 --> 01:30:23,775
We never got to give our speech
at the rehearsal dinner.

2098
01:30:23,855 --> 01:30:26,233
Because we ruined it. With fights.

2099
01:30:27,058 --> 01:30:28,594
But we just wanted
everybody here to know...

2100
01:30:29,094 --> 01:30:30,596
exactly how we feel about you.

2101
01:30:31,062 --> 01:30:32,097
Lights.

2102
01:30:36,968 --> 01:30:39,074
Did you know this was coming?

2103
01:30:49,115 --> 01:30:53,586
You are so beautiful

2104
01:30:54,086 --> 01:30:56,532
So beautiful

2105
01:30:56,856 --> 01:30:57,857
Aww.

2106
01:30:59,792 --> 01:31:00,913
To me

2107
01:31:00,993 --> 01:31:02,097
Aww.

2108
01:31:03,162 --> 01:31:04,917
Can't you see?

2109
01:31:04,997 --> 01:31:06,704
You're so beautiful

2110
01:31:07,099 --> 01:31:08,669
This is real beautiful, man.

2111
01:31:08,968 --> 01:31:13,212
You're everything I hoped for

2112
01:31:13,606 --> 01:31:15,862
- In a little sister!
- Oh!

2113
01:31:15,942 --> 01:31:19,699
You're everything I need

2114
01:31:19,779 --> 01:31:22,851
Everything that I need

2115
01:31:23,916 --> 01:31:25,327
They're kind of good.

2116
01:31:25,418 --> 01:31:27,193
You are so beautiful

2117
01:31:27,821 --> 01:31:29,095
As a couple. Right guys?

2118
01:31:29,756 --> 01:31:30,962
Oh!

2119
01:31:31,158 --> 01:31:32,228
To me

2120
01:31:33,660 --> 01:31:35,264
And to you.

2121
01:31:35,729 --> 01:31:37,265
And to you. To all of us.

2122
01:31:37,364 --> 01:31:38,843
You're beautiful, Jeanie!

2123
01:31:43,003 --> 01:31:44,482
Dave, everybody.

2124
01:31:45,005 --> 01:31:46,541
He's gonna draw!

2125
01:31:46,873 --> 01:31:48,113
Love you!

2126
01:31:49,409 --> 01:31:50,513
So sweet.

2127
01:31:50,777 --> 01:31:52,399
Thought they were gonna blow it.
They did not.

2128
01:31:52,479 --> 01:31:53,480
That's good.

2129
01:31:53,847 --> 01:31:56,521
This is how we do it

2130
01:31:58,485 --> 01:32:00,158
This is how we do it

2131
01:32:03,190 --> 01:32:05,363
This is how we do it

2132
01:32:05,692 --> 01:32:07,604
This is how we do it

2133
01:32:07,795 --> 01:32:09,217
It's Friday night

2134
01:32:09,297 --> 01:32:10,298
Oh, you don't throw...

2135
01:32:10,398 --> 01:32:11,604
And I feel all right

2136
01:32:12,333 --> 01:32:14,656
The party's here on the west side

2137
01:32:14,736 --> 01:32:17,192
So I reach for my forty and I turn it up

2138
01:32:17,272 --> 01:32:19,479
Designated driver got the keys to my truck

2139
01:32:19,574 --> 01:32:21,713
- Hit the shore 'cause I'm faded
- Faded

2140
01:32:21,809 --> 01:32:22,797
Honey on the streets saying

2141
01:32:22,877 --> 01:32:23,981
Monty, yo, we made it

2142
01:32:24,145 --> 01:32:26,267
I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because

2143
01:32:26,347 --> 01:32:28,190
This is how we do it

2144
01:32:28,283 --> 01:32:30,786
South Central does it like nobody does

2145
01:32:31,019 --> 01:32:32,540
This is how we do it

2146
01:32:32,620 --> 01:32:33,608
All right.

2147
01:32:33,688 --> 01:32:37,900
To all my neighbors, you got much flavor
This is how we do it

2148
01:32:38,126 --> 01:32:41,403
# StangleBenoit2016.

2149
01:32:42,230 --> 01:32:44,107
Hell yeah!

2150
01:32:45,166 --> 01:32:46,441
Oh, God!

2151
01:32:46,835 --> 01:32:47,870
Well...

2152
01:32:49,204 --> 01:32:50,808
I picked a bad pose, guys.

2153
01:32:51,307 --> 01:32:52,342
Fireworks!

2154
01:32:53,409 --> 01:32:55,013
These are for you, Jeanie!

2155
01:32:56,178 --> 01:32:58,124
Fireworks close the show!

2156
01:33:00,182 --> 01:33:01,957
Those are from China, those fireworks.

2157
01:33:16,699 --> 01:33:19,009
You idiots! You fucking...

2158
01:33:31,848 --> 01:33:33,336
This is cool.

2159
01:33:33,416 --> 01:33:34,952
I didn't know you could do it this way.

2160
01:33:35,085 --> 01:33:36,428
Oh...

2161
01:33:39,222 --> 01:33:40,277
I'm done.

2162
01:33:40,357 --> 01:33:42,012
Fuck. Holy shit.

2163
01:33:42,092 --> 01:33:43,113
Okay.

2164
01:33:43,193 --> 01:33:44,695
That was great. Good job.

2165
01:33:59,008 --> 01:34:00,730
I'm so behind right now
on Game of Thrones.

2166
01:34:00,810 --> 01:34:04,235
I don't even know what's happening
with Khaleesi and her Dothraki boyfriend.

2167
01:34:04,315 --> 01:34:07,159
Okay. Well he's dead, and so is Jon Snow.

2168
01:34:07,251 --> 01:34:08,372
Jon Snow?

2169
01:34:08,452 --> 01:34:10,329
Fuck that dude.
I'm taller than him anyways.

2170
01:34:10,454 --> 01:34:11,933
Saw him.

2171
01:34:12,690 --> 01:34:16,100
I just found out some spelunker
went dunkin' in your bunker.

2172
01:34:17,695 --> 01:34:20,851
You are fresh as a fucking dick
in the morning.

2173
01:34:20,931 --> 01:34:22,420
That's not that fresh.

2174
01:34:22,500 --> 01:34:24,912
Have you ever sucked a dick
in the morning?

2175
01:34:25,336 --> 01:34:27,758
I brush my teeth with dick, girl.

2176
01:34:27,838 --> 01:34:30,214
- Alright...
- What?

2177
01:34:30,307 --> 01:34:31,979
Oh. Fox don't like that joke?

2178
01:34:33,577 --> 01:34:35,784
I'm gonna throw up. You look like meat!

2179
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:37,359
Inner dialogue, inner dialogue.

2180
01:34:37,481 --> 01:34:39,003
I once got lockjaw so bad

2181
01:34:39,083 --> 01:34:40,756
that I was sucking a homeless man's thumb.

2182
01:34:40,851 --> 01:34:42,373
Dave actually had to
come get me from the hospital...

2183
01:34:42,453 --> 01:34:46,244
because they found 13 Pokemon pugs
and a skimmer...

2184
01:34:46,324 --> 01:34:47,701
shoved up my butthole.

2185
01:34:47,893 --> 01:34:50,237
I just had to wait to poop them out.

2186
01:34:50,896 --> 01:34:52,500
Pikachu.

2187
01:34:53,064 --> 01:34:54,270
Pikachu.

2188
01:34:54,933 --> 01:34:56,139
Charmander.

2189
01:34:56,501 --> 01:35:00,380
That's okay. No, no. Keep your dick in.

2190
01:35:02,107 --> 01:35:04,396
For most of my life,
I thought goat cheese...

2191
01:35:04,476 --> 01:35:07,514
was a slang term
for cheese that's gone bad.

2192
01:35:07,612 --> 01:35:10,869
I'd see moldy cheese and I'd be, like,
"Dude, that cheese is goat."

2193
01:35:10,949 --> 01:35:12,758
Like, "Get that goat cheese
off the counter."

2194
01:35:12,984 --> 01:35:15,540
You look like a deconstructed taco.

2195
01:35:15,620 --> 01:35:16,655
Like carnival food.

2196
01:35:16,788 --> 01:35:19,769
Like the waffle that the chef would just go,
"We're throwing that away."

2197
01:35:19,891 --> 01:35:21,898
What are we doing?

2198
01:35:44,250 --> 01:35:47,094
And the home

2199
01:35:48,654 --> 01:35:51,726
Of the

2200
01:35:53,659 --> 01:35:56,731
Brave

2201
01:35:59,232 --> 01:36:00,677
Play ball, Mike.

2202
01:36:06,640 --> 01:36:08,762
You know we saw my nigga

2203
01:36:08,842 --> 01:36:11,298
Mike and me forever
It's the Stang life, bitch

2204
01:36:11,378 --> 01:36:13,967
Stang life, getting rich
Selling fucking liquor quick

2205
01:36:14,047 --> 01:36:16,323
Mike and me forever
It's the Stang life, bitch

2206
01:36:16,416 --> 01:36:19,373
Stang life
I will never die I'm a Stangle, bitch

2207
01:36:19,453 --> 01:36:22,075
Hunchback of Notre D on the B

2208
01:36:22,155 --> 01:36:25,212
Flying fucking girls
to my sister's wedding at the beach

2209
01:36:25,292 --> 01:36:29,035
Now we in first class seats
Couldn't hold me back, G

2210
01:36:29,496 --> 01:36:33,854
Jeanie Stangie being wild
Sippin' Cristal, sippin', sippin' Cristal

2211
01:36:33,934 --> 01:36:35,022
Sippin', sippin' Cristal

2212
01:36:35,102 --> 01:36:36,911
Jeanie, Jeanie, Jeanie Beanie Weanie

2213
01:36:37,037 --> 01:36:40,027
Gettin' married with Eric
Guaranteed he's got a big, big weenie

2214
01:36:40,107 --> 01:36:43,398
I'm proud of my little sister
Proud that she got a wedding ring

2215
01:36:43,478 --> 01:36:46,935
And a necklace, Eric you're my brother now
So that means I'm kinda black

2216
01:36:47,015 --> 01:36:48,824
Oh, wait. Not really. I'm white, man.

2217
01:36:48,917 --> 01:36:50,572
I'm just happy to be
related to you, honestly.

2218
01:36:50,652 --> 01:36:51,873
- Shout out to Eric.
- Eric!

2219
01:36:51,953 --> 01:36:54,275
I be like Superman, let me out the cage

2220
01:36:54,355 --> 01:36:56,578
I got out of my cast
and I flipped the page

2221
01:36:56,658 --> 01:36:59,247
And now I'm drawing comic books
like I used to do

2222
01:36:59,327 --> 01:37:02,750
Kinda cool,
