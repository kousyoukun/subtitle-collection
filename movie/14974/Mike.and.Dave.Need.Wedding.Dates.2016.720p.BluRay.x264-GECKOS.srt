1
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,588
Oh, no
Oh, no

2
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,915
Ahhh, oh, no
Ahhh, oh, no

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,072
Ahhh, oh, no

4
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:48,632
No, she don't mess around
No, she don't mess around

5
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,274
100% blue agave.

6
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,835
Taste it.

7
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,512
Look, Mike,
I like you.

8
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,955
But no one's looking for
another brand of tequila.

9
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,560
They've got the three...
What is it?

10
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,477
The Cuervo, the other one,
and the third one.

11
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,159
And they don't need
more tequila.

12
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,880
If I can't sell it,
it's not gonna sell.

13
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,154
People want the new-new.

14
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,673
The "new-new"?
The "new-new."

15
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,995
They want that new-new.

16
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,080
No!

17
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,628
What if I could sell
this tequila to a customer?

18
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,896
Would I have
your order then?

19
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,920
Yeah, sure.

20
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,800
And I'm just gonna pick
a customer at random.

21
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,080
Excuse me, sir.

22
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,311
Do you enjoy
the taste of tequila?

23
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,536
Why, yes, I do.

24
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,039
But I only drink
my particular brand,

25
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,752
and you will not
convince me otherwise.

26
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,080
It's a perfect candidate.
Because it's your brother!

27
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,275
I know that's your brother.

28
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,714
He dated my niece.

29
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,096
Look, mate,
I don't know your niece.

30
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,872
Okay.
But if I did...

31
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,393
I'd say she was
a little clingy,

32
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,920
and she'd freak
a lot of people out.

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,797
We play Words With Friends
together, right?

34
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,075
Dave, right?

35
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,997
Name's Rick.
Just got in from Melbourne.

36
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,160
His name's Rick.

37
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,514
I know he's your brother.

38
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,720
Look, look, look.

39
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,160
You guys are funny,
you're weird.

40
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,519
We do this
every couple weeks...

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,240
All right, I'll take 10 cases.

42
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,376
- Fuck, yes!
- Yes!

43
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,400
Yes! I knew it!

44
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,696
We sold your ass, Randy!

45
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,856
I don't know
if that's what happened.

46
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,256
It was the hat, right?
Was it the hat?

47
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,440
I just found this over there.

48
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,320
Do something crazy

49
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,595
Live like it's Mardi Gras

50
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,358
And go jump
Make the party start

51
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,317
Don't need no R&R

52
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,231
To regular life,
I say au revoir

53
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,635
Yay! Living life
in the fast lane

54
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,278
Now your pain
only be champagne

55
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,870
So please come join me
One thing, good vibes only

56
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,949
Start the keg
I'mma fill my cup

57
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,390
Got fireworks, got booze
Let's blow some shit up

58
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,958
Tonight I'm going stupid

59
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,672
Doing things I've never done

60
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,350
We all got one thing in common

61
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,271
We just wanna have fun

62
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,594
Do something crazy

63
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,720
Okay

64
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,435
Do something crazy

65
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,400
Do what you wanna do

66
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,320
Do something crazy

67
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,320
I'm about to do

68
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,400
I'm about to do

69
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,440
Do something crazy

70
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,120
Do something crazy

71
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,316
Do something wild

72
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,953
Rolling with the homies

73
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,071
Chicks by my side

74
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,276
Live for the moment

75
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,152
All of the time

76
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,157
Turn up the music

77
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,952
Only good vibes

78
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,976
Sorry to throw
the accent at you, bro.

79
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,816
No, dude. I loved it,
and it kept me in the now.

80
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,193
Do you realize
that that sale

81
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,760
puts us at number three
in the office?

82
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,440
The Stangle bros
are killing it right now!

83
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,736
It's not an actual hat.
They just call it a jimmy hat.

84
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,909
If you wear two, they break.

85
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,150
It's an urban legend...
No, it's not.

86
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,320
Mom, Dad?

87
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,314
Jeanie. Eric.

88
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,313
Don't freak out.
I don't want you to freak out.

89
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,549
Just come on in.

90
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,677
Why don't we all
just sit down?

91
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,760
We gotta talk to you.

92
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,456
We wanna discuss
Jeanie and Eric's wedding.

93
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,595
- Oh! Sweet.
- Okay.

94
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,136
Are you guys thinking
DJ or band?

95
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,240
First thought, band, right?

96
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,952
No. People want to
hear the real songs.

97
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,350
You don't want to hear
a guy singing Beyoncé.

98
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,754
You just want to hear Beyoncé.

99
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,840
Oh.

100
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,070
Yeah, but we want to
talk about...

101
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,991
is you two.

102
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,839
Now, over the years...

103
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,038
a theme has emerged
at our family gatherings.

104
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,599
Everyone's having
a good time...

105
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,880
That's right.

106
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,069
Things are going smoothly.

107
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,229
Party time.

108
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,430
And then you two show up...

109
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,520
stag...

110
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,835
and you hit on girls...

111
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,109
you act like idiots...

112
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,833
and you ruin it.

113
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Ruin it.

114
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,430
What? We are not party ruiners!
Mm-mm.

115
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,914
We're party creators!

116
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,038
And besides, when have we
ever ruined a family event?

117
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,475
Ah!

118
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,720
We thought you
might say that.

119
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,016
Yep, here we go.
And we just stream it.

120
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,040
Apple TV.

121
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,160
We just need your password.

122
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,713
Bryan's baby dick 69.
Yeah.

123
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,353
Bryan's baby dick 69.

124
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,318
What the fuck,
guys? Really?

125
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,480
Got it. Yep.
Is that it?

126
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,560
Good.

127
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,156
Happy Fourth of July!

128
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,595
Oh, shit!

129
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,033
It was fun up
to that point.

130
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,110
God damn it! My trailer!

131
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,349
Oh, shit.

132
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,160
Actually, this is what
we're trying to avoid.

133
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,096
The both of you
are fucking idiots.

134
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,120
Fucking losers!

135
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,272
Grandpa, wake up!
Take his tie.

136
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,896
Are you saying
we had something to do

137
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,558
with Grandfather's death?
Hmm?

138
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,710
He died five years
after that!

139
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,757
That is a lot of guilt
to put us. Shame on you.

140
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,309
Plus, this video only
shows the screw-ups.

141
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,750
Where's the epic tracking
shots of smiling faces?

142
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,080
And everybody looking
at us, just going...

143
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,276
"God, I love Mike and Dave.

144
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,510
"They made this whole
party worth it."

145
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,274
When are the two of you
going to grow up?

146
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,596
This shtick was cute
for a while...

147
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,159
but it's gotten stale.

148
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,231
Mom, come on,
what are you...

149
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,040
You're talking
about us like

150
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,600
we're a couple of
losers or something.

151
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,136
What we don't
want you to do is

152
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,832
go chasing girls
and get out of control.

153
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,274
You understand?

154
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,896
Wait, we can still
talk to girls, right?

155
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,319
You can each talk
to one girl.

156
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,080
The girls that you bring
to the wedding.

157
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,520
What do you mean?

158
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,477
I want you to bring a date.

159
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,517
That's two dates.

160
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,114
You want us to bring
dates to a wedding?

161
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,200
Excuse me?

162
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,435
Are you allowed
to do that?

163
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,800
Nice, respectable,
smart girls!

164
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,269
Keep you in line.

165
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,634
What the fuck?
What?

166
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,160
Are you insane?
Oh, you're kidding.

167
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,515
You are not screwing up
this wedding. Do you hear me?

168
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,280
Mom, do you hear
this river of horse shit

169
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,435
coming out of Dad's mouth?

170
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,637
We don't want you showing up
stag and riling each other up!

171
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,949
We don't rile each other up!

172
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,195
We never get riled up!

173
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,395
I don't get riled!

174
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,680
He doesn't
and I don't, either!

175
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,353
Look at you right now!
You're riled!

176
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,576
Take your head
out of your ass, Dad!

177
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,680
You sound insane right now.

178
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,314
Everybody stop yelling! Okay?

179
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,710
You guys bringing
wedding dates was my idea.

180
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,840
Look, I love the shit
out of you guys.

181
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,878
But everyone
is already stressed out

182
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
about this wedding...

183
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,033
and I just need you
to be cool.

184
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,960
Of course, Jeanie!

185
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,479
Please?

186
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,675
For me?

187
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,216
I promise.
We would never do anything

188
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,240
to mess up your wedding.

189
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,068
Jeanie, we love you.

190
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,936
We want this to be
the best day of your life.

191
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,960
Yeah.

192
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,109
You, too, Eric.

193
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,394
Oh.
Oh. Thank you.

194
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,760
Mostly you, though, Jeanie.

195
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,856
If you want us to bring dates,
we're bringing dates.

196
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,040
All right, it's settled then.

197
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,799
Wedding dates!

198
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,360
Dave, buddy,
let me talk to you

199
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,708
for a second, okay? Listen.

200
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,916
I'm sorry to lump you
in with Mike...

201
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,896
but if I only told your older
brother to bring a date...

202
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,558
he'd get all weird about it.

203
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,830
I just feel like
he's holding you back.

204
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,720
Dad, I don't mind
being lumped in with Mike.

205
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,216
Do you remember
the fifth grade bake sale...

206
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,440
when Mom made
those cupcakes...

207
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,709
and I called them moist?

208
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,949
Mm-hmm.

209
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,195
Everyone called me Moist...

210
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,277
till Mike took a cupcake...

211
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,034
and shoved it
in Tom Ginty's face.

212
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,550
He said,
"Now you're moist, Moist."

213
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,750
That's the kind
of guy Mike is.

214
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,559
So, think on that...

215
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,714
Dad.

216
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,056
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to end that

217
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,120
on such a weird note, Dad.

218
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,240
I love you. And thanks.

219
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,376
Good. I don't want
you to be mad.

220
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,536
I'm not even mad.
I'm not even upset.

221
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,680
We're gonna find some dates.

222
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,080
I gotta say,
some nights,

223
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,314
I am not looking my best.

224
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,556
But tonight is not
one of those nights!

225
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,000
Do you like my hair?
Yeah, girl.

226
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,593
You look good.
No.

227
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,176
We're gonna make
a lot of tips tonight.

228
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,077
Good. We need it.
We don't have any money.

229
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,120
Uh, you got money
for this ride, don't you?

230
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,936
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

231
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,016
'Cause you have money?

232
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,040
I thought you had money.

233
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,120
I don't have any money.

234
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,256
You know I don't
have money.

235
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,576
Yeah, y'all are whispering
like people

236
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,794
that don't got money.

237
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,440
Check it out.
I'mma pay you right now.

238
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,233
Boop. I Apple Paid.

239
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,440
I don't even have Apple Pay.

240
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,478
Yo, Siri, pay this man.

241
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,760
He's already paid.

242
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,840
God damn it!

243
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,240
I'm not gonna
take shit from you,

244
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,315
because this my cab.

245
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,913
You shouldn't
take shit from us.

246
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You should kick us out!

247
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,256
You should kick us
out of this cab.

248
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,280
You know what?

249
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,351
I'm gonna kick you
the fuck out of this cab.

250
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,715
Yeah, just go three more
blocks up on the right...

251
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,800
and then kick us out!

252
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,957
Here we are!

253
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,280
Get out of my cab.

254
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,936
Thank you.
You're a really good person.

255
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,960
Okay, God bless you.

256
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,634
I'm just gonna start driving
for Uber. Fuck it.

257
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,080
Ooh. I got a good idea.

258
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,056
Let's pop off, get a couple
of drinks before work.

259
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,116
Just a few, because I don't
want to get hammered.

260
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,840
Yeah, of course not.
Just a light buzz.

261
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,793
Hey, hey, hey!

262
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,473
Welcome to Sake Bombers...

263
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,835
where your first
Sake Bomb is on us!

264
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,951
Kaboom!
You're drunk, Alice.

265
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,856
You're doing that thing
where you're whispering,

266
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,995
but you're really yelling.

267
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,479
Because I'm upset with you.

268
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,640
Oh, what the hell?

269
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,136
I don't understand
why you just started

270
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,216
yelling at me for no reason.

271
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,753
What the hell
is going on here?

272
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,080
Your little buddy
is shit-faced.

273
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,474
Straight up.

274
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,989
Her fiancé just
left her at the altar.

275
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,296
She's been going
through a hard time.

276
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,456
Are you guys
talking about me?

277
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,480
No, baby girl.

278
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,136
You know how many times
I have come in here...

279
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,879
and she is drunk
off her fucking ass,

280
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,075
dancing on the tables?

281
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,397
Only when Rihanna comes on,
because it's my jam.

282
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,312
I am a strong
independent woman.

283
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,155
And I will get on a table
and shake my shit to RiRi.

284
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,276
Because it's my right.
America!

285
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,360
Feminism!

286
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,136
You just push your tits up
and say feminism?

287
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,513
Yeah. Read a Twitter.

288
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,758
#2016. Women can do shit now.

289
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,039
Don't do that!

290
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,713
Who put her jam on?

291
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,036
Queen RiRi, forever!

292
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,077
I'm really sorry
that I got us fired.

293
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,555
I'm just sort of surprised
it didn't happen sooner...

294
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,153
but I'm still really sorry.
Hey!

295
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,558
Alice, you do not apologize
right now, okay?

296
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,880
You didn't do one thing wrong.

297
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,195
Okay. People need to
get in line with you.

298
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,436
Right. You're right.

299
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,440
Alice, why are you watching
your wedding video?

300
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,696
And Alice...

301
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,948
do you take Luke?

302
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,109
I do.

303
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,440
Because
it's therapeutic.

304
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,176
The more I watch it,
the less I feel.

305
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,416
And do you,
Luke, take Alice?

306
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,440
I do...

307
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,880
not.

308
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,594
Oh, man. Fuck you, Luke.

309
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,388
Oh, fuck that guy.

310
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,908
Fuck him right in his dick.

311
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,115
No!

312
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,838
Because now
I'm picturing his dick

313
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,070
getting fucked
by another dick.

314
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,639
And it makes me
want to protect it.

315
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,394
Oh, my God, girl! Damn!

316
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,238
You're better than this.
Come on!

317
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,913
We're T and A!

318
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,594
Where's the Alice who made
vodka pot brownies with me...

319
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,079
for the junior high
science fair?

320
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,719
Or gave us water balloon tits

321
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,576
and we won that wet T-shirt
contest in Mexico?

322
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,716
Oh, yeah,
they were so nice.

323
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,552
I know, dude.
We need that shit.

324
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,392
I'm tired of living like this.

325
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,913
We need an adventure.

326
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,360
We've got
a great little package

327
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,435
we're selling here, man.

328
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,909
A week in
a tropical paradise...

329
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,308
with two fun-loving,

330
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,998
yet surprisingly
well-read bros?

331
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,120
Yeah.

332
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,016
I read most of the Goosebumps
series, and so did you.

333
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,040
Yeah.

334
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,120
Where do I sign up?

335
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,354
Dude, focus.

336
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,158
Okay.
This is for Jeanie.

337
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,829
So to find the perfect fun,
but nice girls...

338
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,336
we're gonna have to meet
a lot of them.

339
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,360
The Internet!

340
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,640
That's a good idea.

341
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,273
Match.com, Tinder...

342
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,038
Grindr, OkCupid.

343
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,120
Craigslist!

344
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,349
Craigslist?

345
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,440
Craigslist, you think,

346
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,616
that's where you go
to meet nice girls?

347
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,789
Dave?

348
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,632
We met this couch
on Craigslist.

349
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,710
And you wuv this couch,
don't you?

350
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,916
I do love that couch.

351
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,600
I'm gonna unlock
the swag on this bitch.

352
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,680
All right.

353
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,016
Here you go.
Just take a little sip.

354
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,393
Take a little nip-a-roo.

355
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,880
Boom!

356
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,136
Do you think anyone's even
really gonna see this?

357
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,160
God, I hope so.

358
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,589
Like max, what do you think?

359
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,800
We're gonna get, like,

360
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,438
five or six dates out of this,
or what?

361
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,198
I'd be happy with that.

362
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,235
Hey.

363
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,320
Did you see this thing

364
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,960
that Shelly's sending
around the office?

365
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,036
It's a free trip to Hawaii!

366
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,760
Look what someone
posted to my Facebook.

367
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,195
- I gotta tweet this out.
- Those guys are cute.

368
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,360
Alo-hot!

369
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,794
I got the one
on the right.

370
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,552
I like the one on the right.

371
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,776
Oh, I got the one
on the right.

372
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,030
I like the one on the right.

373
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,216
We gotta send this
to everyone.

374
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,275
Let's all apply!

375
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,456
I want
to go to Hawaii.

376
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,496
I just emailed them.

377
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,696
Let's just meet them,
give 'em a chance.

378
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,915
So, you guys want to
go to a wedding?

379
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,555
Uh, what are your names?

380
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,240
Do you guys have names?

381
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,758
Basically we were looking
through Craigslist for work.

382
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,594
Oh, you're both...

383
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,680
Prostitutes.

384
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,478
Whatever.
Take us to Hawaii!

385
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,560
Hawaii!

386
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,954
We can't take you.

387
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,040
No way.

388
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,176
Did you guys
say something about

389
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,576
an all-expenses-paid trip
to Hawaii?

390
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,715
It's just for girls.

391
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,877
That's not a deal breaker.

392
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,229
Hi, my name is Lauralie...

393
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,628
and I'm kind of
new to this.

394
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,720
Yeah.

395
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,915
You're new to...

396
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,719
Online dating. Yeah.

397
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,920
I'm not really looking for

398
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,280
a heteronormative
relationship.

399
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,520
You look like a Nike swoosh.

400
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,949
Goddamn right, I do.

401
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,120
I work at a dog shelter.

402
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,719
Our sister loves dogs.

403
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,136
I wanna make sure
they get really good homes.

404
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,160
What's a good home?

405
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,954
The white homes.

406
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,076
The what homes?
The white homes.

407
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,389
Like white people.

408
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,399
Check, please.

409
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,840
This isn't lipstick. This is
a tattoo, you dumb fuck.

410
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,633
Who are you laughing at?
Who?

411
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,200
All right, look,
here's the deal.

412
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,536
I went through
a divorce, like,

413
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,856
three weeks ago.
I need a vacation.

414
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,233
No.

415
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,416
Okay, you guys sure
you don't want to fuck?

416
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,440
What?
Nothing.

417
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,616
What did you say?
Nothing.

418
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,915
Sounded like you said,
"Do you wanna fuck?"

419
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Do you wanna fuck?

420
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,195
What?
What?

421
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,554
What?
You guys...

422
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,920
Do you want me to fuck you?
No.

423
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,433
No.
I didn't say it, but...

424
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,656
I'll suck your dick
right now. What?

425
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,680
What?

426
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,280
Welcome back.

427
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,635
I'm here with
Mike and Dave Stangle...

428
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,438
who posted an ad
on Craigslist...

429
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,480
looking for dates
for their sister's wedding...

430
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,676
in Oahu, Hawaii.

431
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,955
Well, the ad went viral.

432
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,120
Mm-hmm.

433
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,669
It racked up
over 6, 000 responses...

434
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,035
from women who
actually wanted to go.

435
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,200
Yeah, well, who's counting?

436
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,753
You know, I guess we all are.

437
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,995
Is this my close-up?

438
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,673
You guys, come on.
Craigslist?

439
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,274
Honestly, this is about
finding nice girls...

440
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,749
to go with us to Hawaii
for our sister's wedding.

441
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,120
And I just
want to reiterate...

442
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,480
we're footing
the bill for this

443
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,714
because we're gentlemen.

444
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,035
Free trip to Hawaii?

445
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,675
I'm awake!

446
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,176
Come on. Craigslist.
What's up?

447
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,736
That's where you go
to buy old patio furniture.

448
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,136
You know what else
you can find on Craigslist?

449
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,195
Mm-hmm.

450
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,993
Love.
Mm-mm.

451
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,310
That's right. I said it.

452
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,152
- Love.
- That one seems sweet.

453
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,430
He has a kind soul.

454
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,631
Yeah, and he's
also super hot.

455
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,317
Yeah, he's hot as
fucking balls.

456
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,875
But just to repeat,
we're looking for nice girls.

457
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,350
Like, girls that our mom
and our sister would like.

458
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,830
Okay, look, dude,
we are going to Hawaii.

459
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,439
Let's go on vacation.

460
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,517
But it's not a vacation.
It's a wedding.

461
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,976
Do you really think
a wedding's

462
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,069
the best place for me?

463
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,516
Since the last wedding
I went to was mine...

464
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,159
and it didn't turn out
very well.

465
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,240
I hear you, but look...

466
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,914
this shit is why this shit
is perfect, okay?

467
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,280
Because ever since Luke left,
you haven't been the same.

468
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,988
You need to get over that,
once and for all.

469
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,229
And this our shot, man.

470
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,511
That dude, he's gonna get
your groove back.

471
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,909
This right here

472
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,758
is an opportunity
of a lifetime...

473
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,070
and you know
we are entrepreneurs.

474
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,240
You know what?

475
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,675
Let's make these guys
take us to Hawaii!

476
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,512
You're right! Let's do it!

477
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,680
Let's just do it!

478
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,960
Yes, bitch.
Let's fucking do it!

479
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,096
We'll be right back.

480
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,320
We gonna go to Hawaii!

481
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,356
We gonna go to Hawaii!

482
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,040
Whoa! Whoa!

483
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,389
Hold up!
What?

484
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,478
Those boys said
they wanted nice girls.

485
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,073
We don't look like
nice girls.

486
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,957
Yeah, I guess I haven't
showered in a while.

487
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,071
Fine, well, you know
what we're gonna do?

488
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,073
We're gonna look
respectable as fuck.

489
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,554
Like nice girls.

490
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,919
Ugh.

491
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,150
Dude, it's like
that Jesus rag!

492
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,798
Ow! It's part of me.

493
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,591
Tatiana, your underwear
needs more underwears.

494
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,040
Whoo!

495
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,436
Oh, this dress is my bitch!

496
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,071
Dude, we have met
37 insane women.

497
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,640
We can't bring
any of these girls.

498
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,796
Maybe Dad'll just forget
about his ultimatum.

499
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,918
Why would Dad forget
about an old tomato?

500
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,118
No, his ultimatum.

501
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,429
Old tom...
Ultimatum.

502
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,720
Are you saying "old tomato"?

503
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,520
Ultima-tomb.
Like a tomb or a crypt.

504
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,635
Ultimatum.

505
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,976
Well, we gotta figure
something out,

506
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,036
because the wedding's
coming up quick.

507
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,896
Why is everything
a competition with you?

508
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,150
And I said that first,
so actually, I won that.

509
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,336
So what time
are we meeting them?

510
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,112
Technically, no time.

511
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,636
Yeah, because I was thinking
about emailing them...

512
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,438
but then I was
thinking, um...

513
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,478
what kind of floozy-ass bimbo
would respond to that ad?

514
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,835
Um...

515
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Us.

516
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,456
Yeah, but we're not
like those idiots.

517
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,595
You know what I'm saying?

518
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,558
Because they're all like,
"Oh! Pick me, pick me!"

519
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,871
It's like the guys
interviewing the girls.

520
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,508
Like, it immediately would put
us in an inferior position.

521
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,880
We're gonna flip the script
and Bachelorette that shit.

522
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,136
Those guys would be
lucky to have us.

523
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,160
Right.

524
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,336
We just gotta
make them think so.

525
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,360
Okay, right.

526
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,675
But, you know, I'm really
not good at lying...

527
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,936
because I always
try to start small

528
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,075
and then it gets crazy...

529
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,195
and I make-up stuff

530
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,833
that couldn't
possibly be true.

531
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,754
Baby, you can do this.
Let's practice, okay?

532
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,840
Okay.

533
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,240
Um, what do you like to do?
Drink.

534
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,314
Just sweet teas.

535
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,516
Sweet teas
and biscuits on blimps.

536
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,680
All right, straight up,

537
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,976
you don't have to
do an accent.

538
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,035
I was doing an accent?

539
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,496
And definitely
don't bring up blimps.

540
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,839
Shit! They're leaving.

541
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,400
If it was a competition,
I won it.

542
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,630
All right, don't worry.

543
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,840
It's all part of the plan.

544
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,069
Is it?
Oh, yeah.

545
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,468
What does that mean?
What plan?

546
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,816
I don't know
this part of the plan...

547
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,840
Whoo! Ahh!

548
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,320
Oh, fuck!

549
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,991
Tatiana! Oh!

550
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,080
Holy shit.

551
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,320
Babe. Are you okay?

552
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,357
I'm okay. Yell,
"She can't breathe!"

553
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,675
She can't breathe!

554
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,256
She can't breathe!
Somebody help her!

555
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,280
Somebody give her CPR!

556
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,073
She can't breathe!
I know CPR!

557
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,719
Great!
I was a volunteer EMT!

558
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,416
Hey, don't worry.
My brother's got this, okay?

559
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,953
I took a class.
I know what I'm doing.

560
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,496
She has a weak heart!
Ma'am?

561
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,669
Ma'am?
She has a weak heart.

562
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,956
I'm an EMT.
I'm like a doctor, basically.

563
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,879
I'm here to save
your fucking life, okay?

564
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,115
She's my only friend!

565
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,400
That's her only friend, Mike!

566
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,635
We got a pulse! Okay.

567
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,948
Don't let her die!

568
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,712
Don't you fucking
let her die, Mike!

569
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,956
Just shut the fuck up, Dave!
You, too, shut up!

570
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,878
Both of you, shut up! Okay?

571
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,960
I'm gonna save her life!

572
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,080
Plug the nose.

573
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,800
Oh!

574
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,313
Are you okay?

575
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,188
I am now.

576
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,593
- I saved her life!
- She's okay!

577
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,193
She's okay?
I saved her life!

578
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,919
Thank you! Thank you!

579
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,240
You're under arrest.

580
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,429
She hit my car!

581
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,896
No, you guys,
I'm totally fine, really.

582
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,069
It happens all the time.

583
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,280
That was a vicious hit.

584
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,680
We should take you
to the hospital.

585
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,640
It's crazy. It's almost like
I owe you my life.

586
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,397
Almost.
Yeah. Technically, yeah.

587
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,576
Let me help you
with that ice.

588
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,600
I do.

589
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,869
Oh, no.

590
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,736
Seems like it's going
pretty well with your guy.

591
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,479
Dude, I'm fucking
crushing it! So hard!

592
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,953
Check this out.

593
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:03,078
The kids in my class
are gonna love this story.

594
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,832
I'm a school teacher.

595
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,069
You're a school teacher?
Wow.

596
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,959
Oop. I think they spelt
"frittata" wrong on the menu.

597
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,838
I always notice
words and spelling...

598
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,672
because I'm a teacher...

599
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,674
and that's what I do.

600
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,319
That's...

601
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,948
So, Alice, um,
what do you do?

602
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,949
Manage a hedge fund.

603
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,435
You manage a hedge fund?

604
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,670
I don't even know
what a hedge fund is.

605
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,354
Oh. So there's a regular fund,
and then there's a hedge fund.

606
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,590
And our fund...

607
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,475
Uh, we hedge it.

608
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
We hedge it hard.

609
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,160
Oh, wow.

610
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,480
I get in, in the morning,
and I'm like...

611
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,834
"How's the hedging coming?"

612
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,439
"You been hedging?
You hedged much?"

613
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,915
And it's like, too big to fail.

614
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,037
Corporate greed, bailouts.

615
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,316
In a New York minute,
everything can change.

616
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,518
On the floor of the NASDAQ
and the U.N.

617
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,835
And then, Fannie Mae.

618
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,829
Bernie Mac
and D.L. Hughley...

619
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,280
Alice, you want some water?
Yeah.

620
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,238
That's so smart.
That is.

621
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,320
"But what I do have...

622
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,555
"is a particular
set of skills.

623
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,200
"Skills I have acquired
over a very long career.

624
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,999
"Skills that make me
a nightmare

625
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,354
"for people like you."

626
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,195
Click. That's it.

627
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,549
That was amazing.

628
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,080
It was like Dave
was not even here...

629
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,200
and I was just standing
in a bar with Liam Neeson.

630
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,840
Like, "Hello,
Liam Neeson's over here."

631
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,395
You're a professional
comedian or something?

632
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,358
What? No. I sell liquor
with my brother.

633
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,520
Oh.
Yeah.

634
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,512
I do like to draw.
Oh, yeah?

635
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,440
Yeah, I have drawings here
I could show you.

636
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,069
Oh, shit, not that. Sorry.

637
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,356
Here. So,
they're like The Avengers...

638
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,232
but they're different
types of alcohol.

639
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,959
So, you have Tequila,

640
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,720
and then he's got
his pet worm right there.

641
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,677
And his name is Lil' Mez.

642
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,433
Because he'll "Mez" you up.

643
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,318
The next one right there,
that's Gin.

644
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,416
When he flips his cap off,

645
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,440
dawg, he's just like...

646
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,351
"Yo, I'll pop you off.
Guaranteed.

647
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,555
"One knock."

648
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,875
Done.

649
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,513
Next, Whiskey.

650
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,736
Likes to make moonshine

651
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,398
and kill bad guys.

652
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,391
Dude, this is
objectively amazing.

653
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,595
Thanks.

654
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,075
What's the hardest thing
about being a teacher?

655
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,720
I don't know.

656
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,920
Oh, um...

657
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,998
The hardest thing
about being a teacher...

658
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,149
is teaching cursive.

659
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,759
That's awesome.

660
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,638
What about you?
Yeah?

661
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,597
Are you seeing anyone?
No.

662
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,037
My ex is gone. Long gone.

663
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,120
What do you mean?

664
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,117
He died. Of cancer.

665
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,440
Oh, my God.

666
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,600
And AIDS.

667
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,080
He died twice?

668
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,749
And then he died
in a plane crash, so...

669
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,231
Whoo! That's a lot
to take in.

670
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,311
I know!

671
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,868
Thank you.

672
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,559
Thank you, brotha.

673
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,919
Dude.

674
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,833
We should take these girls
to the wedding. Right?

675
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,718
Mine's a sexy
school teacher...

676
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,229
and yours... hedges funds.

677
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,799
Just keep doing sexy eyes.
Okay.

678
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,313
Keep doing sexy eyes.

679
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,394
I like Alice.

680
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,955
And she's smart,
she's funny, she's weird.

681
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,656
We invite these girls
to the wedding,

682
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,113
suddenly we're not losers.

683
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,793
We're winners!

684
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,496
Here they come.
They're coming.

685
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,238
Hey, uh,
this might sound crazy...

686
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,954
but our little sister is
getting married in Hawaii...

687
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,912
and we wanted to know

688
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,275
if you guys
wanted to come with.

689
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,959
Um...
Um...

690
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,190
Can you just
give us a second to...

691
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,988
Of course.

692
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,118
Okay, so just whisper
like we're talking it over...

693
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,416
like we're not sure
if we wanna go or not.

694
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,440
Oh, like...

695
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,280
What the fuck
are you doing?

696
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,016
I don't understand
why we're arguing!

697
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,189
I thought we wanted to go.

698
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,880
All right, fuck it.
Let's go to Hawaii!

699
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,159
- Yes! Fuck yes!
- Hawaii!

700
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,056
Yo, what you know
about goin' out?

701
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,275
Head west, red Lex
TV's all up in the headrest

702
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,630
Try and live it up,
ride true, a bigger truck

703
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,234
Peeps all glittered up
Stick up can, they go what?

704
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,191
Jig wit it 'cuz ship crisp,
split it all

705
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,430
Ho's ride, get your nut
'till I can't get it up

706
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,717
Bad, bad, bad, bad boy

707
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,159
You make me feel so good

708
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,240
Aloha, and welcome.

709
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,400
Hi.
Aloha.

710
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,589
For real?

711
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,320
Let me get you gentlemen
checked in, yeah?

712
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,393
Holy shit,
this place is nice!

713
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,676
It's gonna be more nice.

714
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,075
Nice girls don't show
off their ecstasy.

715
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,514
One of these
is a multivitamin.

716
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,720
Is this shit free?

717
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,233
I can smoke weed
out of this,

718
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,588
I can smoke weed
out of this...

719
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,917
Look at that teacher,
grabbing her apple a day.

720
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,193
Look at that personality
from behind.

721
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,277
It is, dare I say...

722
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,913
well-rounded.
Mmm-hmm.

723
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,040
Look at Mike.

724
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,376
He looks like
a funhouse mirror version

725
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,480
of a better looking dude...

726
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,674
but he is just that dude.

727
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,871
Dave, it is so on
this weekend.

728
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,435
I am not touching
this guy the whole weekend.

729
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,856
He thinks just because
he brought me here

730
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,880
I'm gonna sleep with him?

731
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Check it out.

732
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,230
If this was Mike's dick,
I'd be like...

733
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,117
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo...

734
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,720
I'd get close,
but I'd never touch it.

735
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,749
They have such
beautiful flowers here.

736
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,275
She's throwing out
serious vibes right now.

737
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,475
I'm like, I'm hungry.

738
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,788
I'm gonna
butter them biscuits.

739
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,752
I'm gonna baste
them ham hocks.

740
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,273
I'm gonna be
like a sex chef.

741
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,397
Mr. Grey will see you now.

742
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,909
I'm gonna touch Dave.

743
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,520
Every time he says
something sweet...

744
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,232
I wanna get
some rope and chain

745
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,679
in bulk from Home Depot...

746
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,751
and just see where
it takes us, you know?

747
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,672
That is messed up.

748
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,077
Ladies,
your wedding itineraries.

749
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,679
# DoingltForJeanie.

750
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,736
Today, we have the
meet and greet by the pool.

751
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,751
And then after that,
we have a dolphin excursion.

752
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,353
Friday is
the rehearsal dinner.

753
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,509
Mmm-hmm.

754
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,736
That's where Dave and I are
gonna be doing our big speech.

755
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,796
Will there be any downtime?

756
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,816
Yeah, 'cause I gotta
keep in touch with the office.

757
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,035
I gotta call my stocks
about the state of my bonds.

758
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,120
It happens a lot.

759
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,794
Mm-kay, I think
we are right up here.

760
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,273
Great. So which one
is me and Alice's room?

761
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,915
Uh...

762
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,310
I don't know. Are you
and Alice gonna share a room?

763
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,795
Or I was thinking
that maybe you and I...

764
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,632
would stay in the same room.

765
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,637
That sounds interesting...

766
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,791
but I don't think
it would be a good idea.

767
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,160
Why not?

768
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,194
Because I don't
trust myself around you.

769
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,159
You can trust me.

770
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,515
I do trust you.

771
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,639
Let's trust each other.

772
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,877
There's so much trust.

773
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,395
Sorry.
I didn't mean to do that.

774
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,675
I respect you so much,
I can't wait to get you alone.

775
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,760
Yeah, we're gonna cover

776
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,056
all the room charges
and stuff...

777
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,593
for up to $50 per day.

778
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,896
Oh, my God.
You don't have to do that.

779
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,990
I'm a very strict teacher.

780
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,633
You be Michelle Pfeiffer

781
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,995
from Dangerous Minds,
and I'll be...

782
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,434
I'll be Coolio.

783
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,511
Coolio's not in that movie.
Oh.

784
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,718
He is in song and spirit.

785
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,633
I'm gonna call a
parent-teacher conference...

786
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,518
and tell them what
a bad boy you are.

787
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,908
Please don't tell my mommy.

788
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,519
Please don't tell my daddy.

789
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,591
I think Wi-Fi is included,
too, so...

790
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,880
That's always nice. Yeah.
Yeah.

791
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:55,119
If I were to give you a grade,
I'd give you a D.

792
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,394
A big, hard D.

793
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,959
Why? I deserve an A.

794
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,519
What are you talking about?
Oh.

795
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,755
Nothing.

796
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,239
In conclusion...

797
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,789
I'm gonna stay in the room...

798
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,029
with Alice.

799
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,111
That one, with Alice.

800
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,633
Cool, cool. No doubt.

801
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,192
Somebody overcooked
the soft pretzel.

802
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,536
My dick is hard.
That's what I'm saying.

803
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,629
Give me five minutes.

804
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,280
Oh, my God. Ew!

805
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,477
Lift it, drop it, shake it

806
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,233
It's going down for real

807
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,595
It's going down for real

808
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,560
Grandma, I'd like you
to meet Alice.

809
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,216
She's super smart,
great conversationalist,

810
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,400
and she works on Wall Street.

811
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,833
But I'm one of
the good ones.

812
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,399
I think she is.

813
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,320
I am a teacher, yeah.

814
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,600
And you know what?

815
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,320
The key to teaching children
is repetition.

816
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,311
You'd be surprised
how stupid they are.

817
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,200
Jeanie!

818
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,512
Hey, you!
Hi! Hi!

819
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,514
I'm so proud to introduce
our wedding dates...

820
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,318
Tatiana.
And Alice.

821
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,834
Hi!

822
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,936
Oh, the bride.
The gorgeous bride.

823
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,960
Ow! Hi.

824
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,795
This weekend is all about you
being happy and not shattered.

825
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,960
Oh. Thank you.

826
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,075
Yeah.

827
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,160
Check out your arms.

828
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,520
You got some
Michelle Obama arms.

829
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,031
How'd you get those guns
on the plane, girl?

830
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,599
Eric...

831
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,880
you are two points hotter
just being next to this woman.

832
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,136
Try 10 points hotter.

833
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,160
Try a million.

834
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,240
That's too many points.

835
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,440
Wow, and Jeanie, nice snag.

836
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,480
Thank you.

837
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,256
You guys
look great together, really.

838
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,554
I'm liking this. Huh?

839
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,656
Maybe you two will keep these
two in check a little bit.

840
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,511
I think we can.

841
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,988
I'll just keep him on a leash.

842
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,918
Maybe don't hurt him.

843
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,479
I like these girls.

844
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,709
They're so fun.

845
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,996
Unlike my maid of honor.

846
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,269
She's having a time.

847
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,600
How is ol' Becky Grammerstein?

848
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,680
She's coming.

849
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,159
Jeanie.
Hey.

850
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,639
I'm in crisis mode.

851
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,478
I ordered Prosecco
for the mani-pedis...

852
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,840
and all they have
is champagne!

853
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,000
Aren't they the same thing?

854
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,275
No. No, they're not. No.

855
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,509
No?

856
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,832
Hello, Michael.

857
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Hi, Dave.

858
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,990
Look, I'm trying to make
your dreams come true, okay?

859
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,195
Right.
What?

860
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,151
If this is bad news,
I'm gonna eat your ass.

861
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,275
Sorry.
Okay.

862
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,356
Purple. It better be purple.

863
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,716
I should probably
go see to that.

864
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,880
You'll come?
Yeah.

865
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,359
Thank you so much
for being here.

866
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,432
Guys, good job
with these two.

867
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,079
Mahalo.

868
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,508
Bye, Jeanie.

869
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,816
Jeanie likes the girls.

870
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,080
Jeanie likes the girls

871
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,800
Talk about Jeanie
Jeanie likes the girls

872
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,637
Because it's all about
Jeanie likes the girls

873
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,856
Oh, yeah,
Jeanie likes the girls

874
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,880
Come on!

875
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,400
It's all about Jeanie
Likes the girls

876
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,616
It's all about
Jeanie likes the girls!

877
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,278
Mike. Where are the girls?

878
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,554
Oh, hello!
I'm Alice.

879
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,016
I just I wanna give you a hug.

880
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,439
It's so nice to meet you.

881
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,960
Fucking A.
You distracted me, man.

882
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,071
This dress is lucky to be
on you. Those pins!

883
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,269
My Mike?
Yes.

884
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,629
I can't... Wow.
He did.

885
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,472
That's fantastic.

886
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,312
Mike, Tatiana was
just telling me...

887
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,873
that you saved her life.

888
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,314
I most certainly did,
Father.

889
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,279
You see how great it is
to have nice girls around?

890
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,640
I mean, these are nice girls.
Aw!

891
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,795
Absolutely.

892
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,136
They are.
And we brought them, so...

893
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,388
Excuse me.

894
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,600
Excuse me.

895
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,696
See you in a minute.
Honey, come on.

896
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,856
Can I get
everybody's attention?

897
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,880
Could we gather around?

898
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,353
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!

899
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,232
We're killing this shit!
We're killing.

900
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,549
Mom and Dad like the girls!

901
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,709
Ow.

902
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,233
Mom and Dad like the girls

903
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,311
Hi, I'm Keith.

904
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,914
I'm Eric's best man,
his cousin...

905
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,071
and his best friend.

906
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,759
Welcome to the meet and greet!

907
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,394
Yeah!

908
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,749
Put your hands together...

909
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:38,037
for Eric and his lovely bride,
Jeanie.

910
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,792
Give it up!

911
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,069
Jeanie!

912
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,832
Hey, everybody.
A big thank you

913
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,751
to my new family,
the Stangles.

914
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,989
We love you, Eric!

915
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,080
Thank you.

916
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,310
And to my own family,
I must say...

917
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,958
Portland, Oregon
in the house!

918
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,432
I'm really happy to finally
make you all my ohana...

919
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,953
which means "family."

920
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,156
And as the Hawaiians say...

921
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,514
Kole maluna!

922
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,797
Which translates loosely
into "bottoms up."

923
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,599
But more closely translated,
it actually means...

924
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,235
"your butts to the sky"...

925
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,958
which is inappropriate.

926
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,793
This is gonna be magic.

927
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,671
Thank you all again,
so much, for being here.

928
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:22,515
We are so happy
to have you at our wedding.

929
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:26,794
Wedding. Wedding. Wedding.

930
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,992
Put the mic on the stand.
The stand.

931
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,360
Alice.

932
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,475
Where are you going?

933
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,560
Hi! What happened?

934
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,656
You sort of zoned out
for a sec.

935
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,680
What's up? You okay?

936
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,229
Yeah! We're at a wedding.
Wedding. Wedding.

937
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,153
You just said "wedding"
three times.

938
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,309
I'm fine. Yeah!

939
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,200
Let's just forget about
the past, and move on.

940
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,072
To the bar!

941
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,434
To the bar?

942
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,400
Mmm. Mmm.

943
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,313
Ooh. I don't think
these are shots.

944
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,136
I mean, we're drinking 'em
like they're shots...

945
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,160
but I don't think they're

946
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,440
supposed to be
drunk like that.

947
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,516
Your face is funny.

948
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,078
Oh. Hey, Mike.

949
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,936
I was just talking
to my new friend, Tatiana.

950
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,240
Tatiana,
this is my cousin, Mike.

951
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,510
She knows who I am.
She's my date.

952
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,439
Why would someone this
attractive ever be with you?

953
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,856
Are you gonna hit
on my date all weekend,

954
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,949
like bisexual Fonzie?

955
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,320
I don't think it's gonna take
all weekend. Am I right?

956
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,794
So, you guys are cousins?

957
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,856
She's been jealous of me
since I was a little kid.

958
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,280
What could I possibly be
jealous of?

959
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,709
Your outfit looks like
Jimmy Buffet's dust ruffle.

960
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,110
Do you guys always do this?

961
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,176
Okay, this is actually
a very fashion-forward outfit.

962
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,400
No, you look like
the wallpaper

963
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,800
from a Long John
Silver's bathroom.

964
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,616
Cool. I'm gonna
hit the buffet now...

965
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,269
while you guys do
whatever it is you're doing.

966
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,355
Okay?

967
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,440
Good idea.

968
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,875
Look at that.

969
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,110
Pink little ass just
bouncing away, saying...

970
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,670
Terry, come get me
Terry, come get me

971
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,829
No, it's saying...

972
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,598
Mike, crawl up in this

973
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,950
Mike, crawl up in this

974
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,917
Whoa. What's up,
double trouble?

975
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,308
Terry. Cousin of the bride.

976
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,776
Get at me later,
we'll make a Terry sandwich.

977
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,233
Don't touch her.
She has chlamydia.

978
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,549
Everybody does.
No.

979
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Not everyone does.

980
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,960
Saw you and Dave are doing

981
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,136
your speech together
at the rehearsal dinner.

982
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,160
Mmm-hmm.

983
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,754
I'm going to bring the house
down with my speech.

984
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,758
And why do you think
you're such a hotshot?

985
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,069
You know Chris Rock?

986
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,831
He's my neighbor.
Practiced my speech on him.

987
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,436
And he gave me
seven killer jokes.

988
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,069
Suck on that, cousin.

989
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,760
Terry out.

990
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,638
Chris Rock? Fuck!
That sounds awesome.

991
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,357
Yas, yas, yas.

992
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,278
Oh, my God. You were right.

993
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,634
These cheeseburgers
are amazing.

994
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,955
I know.

995
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,951
Being a good girl is hard.

996
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,031
I know. It sucks.

997
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,998
You were hitting that booze
too hard for a nice girl.

998
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,680
You need to get
Luke out of your head.

999
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,472
Yeah.
You do.

1000
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:11,029
And what better way
to do that...

1001
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,953
than good old-fashioned
dick flicks.

1002
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,120
Yes.

1003
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,309
Oh, God.

1004
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,711
Tatiana. Mike Stangle.

1005
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,871
From the meet and greet.
Well, from before that.

1006
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,513
One second.

1007
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,640
Fuck.

1008
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,035
Hey. It's you.

1009
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,315
It is me.

1010
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,994
I was hoping
maybe I could come in

1011
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,833
and we could
watch a movie or...

1012
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,996
Do whatever you wanna do.

1013
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,269
Why are you whispering?

1014
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,550
'Cause that's what
we were doing before.

1015
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,755
They've got Cockbusters.

1016
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,877
Is that supposed to be
like Ghostbusters?

1017
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,911
Why would you wanna
get rid of the cocks?

1018
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,878
What's that?
She's talking in her sleep.

1019
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,873
She says the craziest stuff
in her sleep.

1020
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,016
It looks like
his dick is gonna pop.

1021
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,109
It's so veiny and hard.

1022
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,235
Tatiana!
Something's hard?

1023
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,515
Julio. My student.

1024
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,360
I'm doing a Skype
class session with him...

1025
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,516
and he's having a really
hard time in the schoolyard.

1026
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,176
If you don't get in here,
I'm gonna start masturbating!

1027
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,679
Oh, phooey. I've gotta go.

1028
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,496
That sounds like you guys are,
watching porno, or...

1029
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,520
- No.
- Tatiana!

1030
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,656
Does it smell like
weed in here?

1031
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,511
You guys smoking weed?
No. It was a skunk.

1032
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,056
I've gotta go,
because a bunch of kids

1033
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,195
are waiting to hear...

1034
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,078
if they've failed
second grade or not.

1035
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,277
Well, I am doing some
grading myself, and girl...

1036
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,908
you are getting an A plus.

1037
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Thank you so much.

1038
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,395
Mmm.

1039
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,480
And then win!

1040
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,629
Skills. Def skills.

1041
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,239
Cheers to
Tatiana and Alice.

1042
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,515
We're so glad you're here.

1043
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,955
Yes. Cheers.

1044
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,236
You guys, Alice and I found
this really cool thing.

1045
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,072
Jurassic Park ATV Tours!

1046
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,310
You ride ATVs where they
shot Jurassic Park.

1047
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:15,752
Actually, we are about to go
swimming with the dolphins.

1048
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,071
It's on the itinerary, so...

1049
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,151
But, guys, Jurassic P!

1050
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,679
I love this movie!

1051
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,354
Oh, my gosh, on ATVs,
this would be so sick.

1052
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,748
"Welcome...

1053
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,639
"...to Jurassic Park."

1054
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,920
"That is a big pile of shit."

1055
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,520
"Oh, you're not so scary,
little guy."

1056
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,793
What is going on here?

1057
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,429
Oh! Oh!

1058
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,671
I wish we could do that...

1059
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,671
but we have a date
with the dolphins...

1060
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,159
at the bottom
of the ocean, so...

1061
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,788
Don't you think we should do
what Jeanie wants to do?

1062
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,473
I mean,
it is her wedding after all.

1063
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,834
Right, Mike?

1064
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,071
I'm so happy we're here!

1065
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,674
This is where the dinos
ran in the prairie!

1066
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,840
I know, girl!

1067
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,150
Check it out!
I'm a brontosaurus!

1068
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,356
I'm a T-Rex.
I'm coming to get you!

1069
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,389
Guys, butts on seats, okay?
No hot dogging!

1070
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,559
"They're flocking
this way!"

1071
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,473
Here's a T-Rex!

1072
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,512
"Life finds a way."

1073
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,871
Jeanie! Eric!

1074
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,393
Hey!

1075
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,432
Hi! Sorry, I lost Eric.

1076
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,717
I wasn't lost. Just driving
at a reasonable pace.

1077
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,200
Stay there. We'll come to you.

1078
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,199
All right,
we better go around.

1079
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,713
This ledge
looks super dangerous.

1080
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,030
Oh, yeah, Mike's right.
It does look dangerous.

1081
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,194
It's a good thing my middle
name is "dangerous!"

1082
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,400
Yeah, it is!

1083
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,391
Whoo!
Whoa!

1084
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,239
Oh, God!
What?

1085
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,518
Oh, my God, she's Superman!

1086
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,549
Oh, my God!

1087
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,914
A-Money!

1088
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,753
Oh!

1089
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,919
I still think
we should go around.

1090
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,270
She just got some
serious air, bro!

1091
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,736
You call that serious air?

1092
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,159
Check this fucking shit out.

1093
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,389
Whoo!

1094
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,311
Suck my clit, fuckers!

1095
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,400
Whoo!

1096
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,240
Whoo!

1097
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,349
Oh, not again.

1098
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,360
Yeah, baby!

1099
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,590
Easy does it. Nothing fancy.

1100
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,576
Oh, my God.
Look at what she's doing!

1101
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,600
I see it!

1102
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,751
Sweet candied nuts.

1103
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,560
Oh!

1104
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,439
Who are these girls?

1105
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,520
Whoo!

1106
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,352
Um...

1107
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,034
Where did you guys
learn to do that?

1108
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,952
We lived in Baja.
Oh.

1109
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,712
Tore up a lot of trail
down there.

1110
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,188
Made a lot of friends.

1111
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,359
Made even more enemies.

1112
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,709
God, I miss Baja.

1113
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,712
Your turn, Mike!
Don't be a pussy!

1114
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,515
I'm not gonna do it.

1115
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,631
Name calling
doesn't work on me, so...

1116
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,074
Mike,
it'll turn me on

1117
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,553
if you take that jump.

1118
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,472
Turn me on if you don't.

1119
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,631
Still not going to, still.

1120
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,800
I'm not gonna do it.

1121
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,154
Like we would ever do that.

1122
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,072
No way.

1123
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,160
Come on! Do it.

1124
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,548
He's not gonna do it. Do it!

1125
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,199
Do not do it.

1126
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,998
No, definitely don't do that.

1127
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,117
It's a bad idea.
It's a stupid, dumb idea.

1128
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,296
And it's dangerous,
and it's foolish.

1129
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,320
Yes, it is.

1130
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,160
I'm gonna do it!

1131
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,760
Mike!

1132
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,909
Oh, shit!
Oh.

1133
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,594
Oh!

1134
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,869
I'm never gonna die!

1135
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,758
Oh, shit.
He going fast.

1136
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,512
Oh, no. Keep it straight!

1137
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,480
Oh, he's shanking it.

1138
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,079
Whoo! Got it, got it!

1139
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,554
Oh, no, God!

1140
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,715
Jeanie, move!

1141
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,280
No!

1142
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:53,432
No!

1143
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,235
It's gonna be fine.

1144
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,716
Your face is making me think
it's gonna be bad.

1145
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,677
I'm sure
it's not as bad as you think.

1146
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,800
- You know?
- No. Yeah.

1147
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,136
Just show us
what we're working with,

1148
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,160
and it'll be fine.

1149
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,240
Okay.
Okay?

1150
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,919
Is it okay?

1151
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,513
Oh, my God!
Oh! God! Oh!

1152
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,269
Wow! Don't you look good?

1153
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,951
Your face!
Shut up, Mike!

1154
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,911
You shut up, Becky!
Have you seen her face?

1155
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,911
Oh, God! What?

1156
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,216
It looks like
you were making meth,

1157
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,309
and the bathtub exploded.

1158
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,919
You look like
Burn Victim Barbie.

1159
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,599
Hush it up!

1160
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,909
And you're Black Ken.

1161
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,911
Stop!
Okay.

1162
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,150
It's like an exaggerated
smoky eye.

1163
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,271
Dave, be honest. Is it bad?

1164
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,195
This side,
there's a little...

1165
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,336
There's a little
discoloration there.

1166
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,395
Little discoloration.

1167
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,595
Which side is it?

1168
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,456
You could do a dance
the whole night

1169
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,736
where you just hold a hand
over your face.

1170
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,880
Oh, that's smart.
Okay.

1171
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,955
It's like a new thing.

1172
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,951
Do the Jeanie
Do the Jeanie

1173
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,752
Like this?

1174
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,837
Come on, everybody!
Do the Jeanie. Do it.

1175
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,456
- I'm doing the Jeanie.
- Do the Jeanie, y'all.

1176
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,515
It's a one-two step.

1177
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,437
All right, that's enough.

1178
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,318
Enough dancing!
You and you...

1179
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,839
outside, now!

1180
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,194
Honey, calm down.

1181
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,513
Honey, calm down.
Sorry.

1182
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,989
Do you understand they've
deformed our little girl...

1183
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,276
the day before
her goddamn wedding?

1184
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,716
She looks like Seal,
for Christ's sake!

1185
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,597
Oh! Why, Dad?

1186
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,680
Ow!

1187
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,119
Do you think
he's gonna spank us?

1188
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,320
What?

1189
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,040
Never mind.

1190
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,116
I haven't seen him this
pissed in a long time.

1191
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,235
Oop.

1192
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,151
Yeah. It's the other door.

1193
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,149
They meet in the middle.

1194
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,798
They meet in the middle.
God damn it!

1195
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,395
Dad, listen.
I know what you're gonna say.

1196
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,795
You're right. We're gonna
sue the ATV companies.

1197
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,074
- Right?
- I see.

1198
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,200
Not what I was gonna say.

1199
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,600
Let's Erin Brockovich
this bitch.

1200
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,318
Mike, stop!

1201
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,710
You've got to own this.
This is your fault.

1202
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,800
It's not.

1203
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,311
If anything,
it's the girls' fault.

1204
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,914
They're crazy.

1205
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,469
The girls aren't the problem!

1206
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,913
You are.

1207
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:15,196
What the hell did you think
was gonna happen, huh?

1208
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,072
What did you think
was gonna happen?

1209
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,280
We had a plan.

1210
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,829
The plan was
to swim with dolphins...

1211
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,672
and eat bananas afterwards.

1212
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,736
See, Dad, I'm not gonna
point any fingers here...

1213
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:25,760
but indirectly...

1214
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,273
we wouldn't have been on ATVs

1215
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,640
if the girls
hadn't forced us to.

1216
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:31,194
And who made us bring dates
in the first place?

1217
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,429
Not pointing fingers.
Yeah.

1218
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,801
All right. I'm gonna take back
what I said to you earlier.

1219
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,036
I am going to
lump you in together.

1220
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:41,033
All right, you are lumped!

1221
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,551
The hell is wrong
with you, huh?

1222
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,073
What the hell is
wrong with you?

1223
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,039
Dad.

1224
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,073
Fuck.

1225
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,716
Everyone get the fuck
away from me.

1226
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:00,269
Move! Adult Swim!

1227
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,839
It's all fucked now.

1228
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,717
It's all fucked, you know?
Poor Jeanie.

1229
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,831
Jeanie's special weekend,
and I ruin it.

1230
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,515
Hey, hey, hey, Alice?
That was not your fault, okay?

1231
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,056
That's two weddings
that I've ruined.

1232
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,593
It's just like,
"Stupid Alice!"

1233
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:15,069
Look, it's too bad that
Jeanie's face got shredded...

1234
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,952
but this is supposed
to be our vacay.

1235
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,837
Remember? We're supposed
to be having fun...

1236
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:19,989
and going on adventures.

1237
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,195
Get in here with me.

1238
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,856
I'm gonna find her.
I'm gonna make it up to her.

1239
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,348
No, no! You're not listening
to me. Don't leave me!

1240
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:28,560
Ah!

1241
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,268
Oh.

1242
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:34,595
Hmm?

1243
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,040
Thanks again for letting me
join your spa day, ladies.

1244
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,553
It's not like you
asked or anything,

1245
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,870
but you're here. Yay.

1246
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,436
What did you guys do
for your bachelorette party?

1247
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:45,560
Did it get crazy?
Did you guys do that thing...

1248
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:46,675
where you go to Vegas

1249
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,432
and you dress up
as a prostitute...

1250
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,478
and you go out
and there's a contest...

1251
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,755
to see who can get
the most money from a john...

1252
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,936
but then you tell him,
"I'm an undercover cop"...

1253
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,416
and they, like,
beg that you don't tell

1254
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:57,953
their children
and their wives...

1255
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:59,235
and they piss themselves,

1256
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,880
and you've got
the whole thing on video.

1257
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,393
And then you put it on YouTube

1258
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,993
and then there's
the Auto-Tune remix.

1259
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,160
Did you do that thing?

1260
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:06,909
No.
No.

1261
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:11,756
I didn't actually end up
having one, so...

1262
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,640
Why? Every bride
needs a bachelorette party.

1263
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,876
I'm sorry Cabo didn't
work out, Jeanie.

1264
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:17,473
I know. It's fine.

1265
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:18,656
You know I couldn't get
the time off work.

1266
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:19,776
And it would have
ruined it for you,

1267
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,028
down there without me.

1268
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,376
Is there some tension
about this?

1269
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,656
So I just thought,
"Let's cancel the whole trip,"

1270
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:24,999
if that makes sense.

1271
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,136
Jeanie, can you keep it down?
On the phone with Tokyo.

1272
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,296
Did I bring up
something uncomfortable?

1273
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,629
Also, I caught the shingles
because it was so stressful.

1274
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:33,680
'Cause it feels like I did.

1275
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,240
Plus they have
Mexican bed bugs.

1276
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,115
I need you guys to stop it!

1277
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:43,469
Oh, that fucking gaping mouth
of yours, shut it!

1278
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,040
Shut it!

1279
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:49,189
I just want to relax!
Is that too much to ask?

1280
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:52,200
Please! I just wanna relax.

1281
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,240
How are
you feeling, Jeanie?

1282
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,799
A little stressed out.

1283
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:59,393
I'll give you a minute
to disrobe.

1284
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,794
Yeah, okay.

1285
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,996
Face down on the table.

1286
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,876
Hi, um, that is
my best friend in there...

1287
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:07,976
and she's getting
married tomorrow,

1288
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,149
and she's a little uptight.

1289
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,749
And I was wondering
if you could, um,

1290
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:14,559
help her let loose
a little bit?

1291
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:15,755
You know?

1292
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:20,868
Give her the "Hawaii Five Oh"
experience?

1293
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,839
The wink-wink, nudge-nudge massage,
you know?

1294
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:27,390
I can't really wink,
but a wink-wink, nudge-nudge?

1295
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,438
Are you okay?
Yeah.

1296
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,192
Looks like you
had a bit of a fit.

1297
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,954
No, no. That's wink...
That's wink-wink...

1298
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,430
I feel like I've gotten
what you're trying to say.

1299
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:38,795
Great.

1300
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:39,880
But I figured it out.

1301
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,480
You didn't really
communicate it to me.

1302
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:42,560
Okay, that's fair.

1303
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,474
Yes, you want the special
"I am blissful" massage?

1304
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,716
Yeah.

1305
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,240
Um...

1306
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:52,237
How blissful is that?
Oh, don't worry.

1307
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,913
Physically, no penetration.

1308
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,080
Classy.

1309
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:58,112
Spiritually, I'll be doing
an intimate tour of her qi.

1310
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,436
Oh, you're gonna be
good in there. I can tell.

1311
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:03,080
How's the temperature
in here, Jeanie?

1312
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,397
Oh, it's good. Good. Comfy.

1313
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:08,916
Good. Take down
the light a little bit.

1314
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:10,752
So you're getting
married, huh?

1315
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,598
I am. Yeah.

1316
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,638
I know it can be
a stressful time.

1317
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,153
You know it's like,

1318
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,595
"Who is this for,
me or my family?"

1319
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,194
Yeah. I've recently had
an injury to my face...

1320
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,391
which I'm a little
stressed out about.

1321
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,080
Are you okay with oil?

1322
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,554
Yeah, sure.

1323
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:31,856
You know, in my country...

1324
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:35,156
they call oil
"God's beautiful lubricant."

1325
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,310
It sounds better
in my language.

1326
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,597
Khuda ka khubsurat lubricant.

1327
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,478
Oh, that's lovely.

1328
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:44,560
'Kay.

1329
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,039
Some ground rules.

1330
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:48,680
One, no emotions.

1331
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:49,800
Okay.

1332
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:50,880
Two, breathe.

1333
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,359
Ahh...

1334
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,271
Three,
there is no penetration,

1335
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,628
only vibration.

1336
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,275
What is happening?

1337
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,870
I call this
"The Bent Penguin."

1338
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,508
This one is just
"The Ham and Eggs."

1339
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,592
This one is called
"When Moons Collide."

1340
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,274
"Angry Hummingbird."
"Angry Hummingbird."

1341
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,795
This one is called
"House by the Airport."

1342
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:16,190
Just checking in.
Everything good?

1343
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,429
Hope you're enjoying this.

1344
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,033
For me,
it's just another Friday.

1345
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,991
"Happy Doll."

1346
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:33,158
This one is just called
"Taking a Break." I am pooped.

1347
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:36,039
A little break. That's nice.

1348
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:39,075
Here we go again.

1349
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,513
Are you even touching me?

1350
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:45,154
No, but my aura is.

1351
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,988
Yes, it is!

1352
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:50,514
Sweet baby Jesus!

1353
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:10,749
How's it going?

1354
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,748
Shit, I thought
I was alone in here.

1355
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,878
Oh, yeah. You're not.
I mean, we're alone.

1356
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,795
How's Mike?
Still really jealous of me?

1357
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:24,188
It's like, yeah, okay,
do I own a Tesla? Yes.

1358
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:26,999
Do I make a shit-ton of money,
like, way more than Mike?

1359
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,479
Yes. But it's like, who cares?

1360
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,710
Do I get backstage tickets
to Rihanna?

1361
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,520
Do I have a glass blowing
studio in my basement?

1362
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,591
Hold up, backstage
tickets to Rihanna?

1363
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,671
Yeah, she likes to
have me around. You know.

1364
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,592
RiRi is Alice's jam.

1365
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:40,749
Oh, RiRi, is it?

1366
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:41,875
Yes.
That's funny.

1367
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,256
She would freak out
if I got her

1368
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,508
backstage tickets
to Rihanna.

1369
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,238
Well, you could
get her tickets.

1370
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,799
From me. I'm right here.

1371
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,353
Are you serious?

1372
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,397
Oh, God, steam rooms
just open up

1373
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:52,833
your pores, you know?

1374
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:55,516
They open up everything.

1375
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:02,878
Backstage at RiRi is very fun.
Sometimes she plays the DJ.

1376
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,473
You know,
just scratching records.

1377
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:05,629
You know like...

1378
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,752
Shit, man. That's...

1379
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:15,232
Are you saying you want me to
get in there for the tickets?

1380
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:18,039
No. No, no, no. No.

1381
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,552
Yes.

1382
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,559
Tatiana?

1383
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:27,708
Tatiana? Whoa.

1384
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:31,597
Sorry about that.
Looking for my wedding date.

1385
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,160
Tatiana?

1386
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,395
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

1387
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:39,629
Please leave, sir.

1388
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,040
What are you doing
to my sister?

1389
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:42,195
Mike, I'm coming.

1390
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:43,708
No!

1391
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,394
Get out!

1392
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:02,836
Oh, sure.
Oh, sure. Oh, sure.

1393
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,831
So, are we, like,
close, or...

1394
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,760
Let's put the washing machine
on spin cycle. There we go.

1395
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,674
What the... Tatiana!

1396
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,553
Terry!

1397
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:14,835
Tatiana!

1398
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:15,995
Shut the fuck up, Mike.

1399
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:19,520
Whoa!

1400
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:20,800
I'm gonna kick your ass.

1401
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,319
He is losing this fight!

1402
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,511
Oh, God!
I can see your nipple!

1403
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:30,600
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1404
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:34,840
Get your butt out of my face!

1405
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:43,037
Well, thank you so much.

1406
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,158
Um, I definitely needed this.

1407
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:48,118
I know. Bring this gift
into your marriage.

1408
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:51,194
All you need
is load-bearing ribbons.

1409
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,349
Okay.

1410
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:53,953
And a reinforced ceiling.

1411
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:55,040
Oh.

1412
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:56,354
I should warn you...

1413
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:00,519
you may experience some
aftershock orgasms.

1414
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:01,994
Oh.

1415
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,832
So, I wouldn't operate
any heavy machinery

1416
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,319
for a couple weeks.

1417
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:08,074
That is not a euphemism
for penis. I mean like...

1418
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,356
tractors, cranes...

1419
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:12,710
Okay.
...big boats.

1420
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,552
Good to know.

1421
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:15,789
Oh, and please hydrate.

1422
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,035
Okay.

1423
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:21,273
I cannot stress this enough.
The consequences could be...

1424
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:23,959
You could develop cancer.

1425
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:26,794
You have a very
good friend.

1426
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,634
Wait, you did that?

1427
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:37,918
Yeah, well, I felt so bad
about your fucked up face...

1428
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,399
and I wanted to
make it up to you.

1429
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:41,359
Aw! Thank you.

1430
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:43,233
Hey, who needs
a bachelorette party

1431
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:44,514
when they have you around?

1432
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,797
He rubbed my butt.
Yeah?

1433
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,632
But with his butt.

1434
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,394
It was like...
He was on ribbons.

1435
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:55,376
I don't know what you did
with Jeanie in the spa...

1436
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:56,958
but she's in a great mood.

1437
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,554
Yeah, no problem.
She just needed a release.

1438
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:02,029
Oh, um, I had an idea
for your graphic novel.

1439
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,470
I thought you could do
like a Rum character,

1440
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:06,120
who's like Rastafarian,
and he's like...

1441
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:08,510
"I'm Rum Rum,
get in my tum-tum,

1442
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:09,919
"and I play the steel drum."

1443
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:12,720
"You can rum,
but you cannot hide, mon."

1444
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:15,354
Yeah, that's awesome.
Already, that's so amazing.

1445
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,829
No, that's such a good idea.
How did I not think of that?

1446
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:21,154
I think when I get back,

1447
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,913
I'm gonna stop
selling liquor with Mike...

1448
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:25,513
and start drawing full time.

1449
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:27,153
Really?
Yeah.

1450
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:28,833
That's amazing.

1451
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,069
Do you know how few people

1452
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,336
know what they
really wanna do?

1453
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:32,360
But then I think about

1454
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:33,616
what Mike's gonna think
about it all...

1455
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:35,596
and he's gonna
hate that idea.

1456
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,478
He's so clingy.

1457
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:38,959
When we were kids,

1458
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,439
if I fell asleep
before Mike...

1459
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:42,600
he would always wake me up
so he wouldn't feel alone.

1460
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:44,591
That's kinda sweet.
Yeah.

1461
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,398
I don't know. I just...

1462
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:51,553
Do you ever
get that feeling...

1463
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:55,235
that you're not good enough
to get what you really want...

1464
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,197
so you're too
scared to try?

1465
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,234
All the time.

1466
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:01,960
Really?

1467
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,678
Like, all the time.
It's terrifying.

1468
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:05,757
It is, it's terrifying.
Yeah.

1469
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:06,920
You're, like, stuck.

1470
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:08,718
Totally.
Yeah.

1471
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,600
Thanks. It's nice
talking to you about this.

1472
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,159
Hey, where you going?

1473
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:26,656
Is there a gang bang
in the ballroom

1474
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,680
you need to emcee?

1475
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:29,199
Don't be such a drama king.

1476
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:30,992
Yeah,
I'm totally overreacting.

1477
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,616
When you invite someone
to a wedding...

1478
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:33,736
they obviously are supposed to

1479
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:34,976
finger diddle
your family members.

1480
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
That's common courtesy!

1481
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,390
Okay, hold up.
I am a grown-ass woman.

1482
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,636
I can finger diddle
whomever I want.

1483
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:41,988
Just because
you say "whomever"

1484
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:43,274
does not make it okay.

1485
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:44,634
It's not a big deal.

1486
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:46,910
It's just like
texting someone.

1487
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,071
Oh.
It's just like Tinder.

1488
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:51,800
Swipe right,
swipe right, swipe left.

1489
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:53,711
Swipe left, swipe right.

1490
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,597
That's very graphic.
That is...

1491
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:56,999
Rotating your photos.

1492
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:58,798
Expanding them,
contracting them.

1493
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,376
Are you deliberately
trying to hurt me?

1494
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,515
Is that what you're doing?

1495
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:02,715
What? No!

1496
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,216
I was just trying
to get RiRi tickets...

1497
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,231
to make my best friend
feel better, okay?

1498
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:07,879
We're on vacay.

1499
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:10,920
No...

1500
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:13,190
You are invited
to my sister's wedding.

1501
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,793
You're supposed
to smile, nod...

1502
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,188
and do what I
want you to do.

1503
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:17,360
That's the deal.

1504
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,752
I thought that
we had a connection.

1505
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:21,360
Like a spark.

1506
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:23,016
You thought you were
gonna bring me here

1507
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,439
so that you could
have sex with me.

1508
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:27,234
Yes. No! What? Yeah, right.

1509
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:28,320
Really?

1510
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:31,998
Yes, obviously.

1511
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,196
You are so hot.
And you smell good.

1512
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:36,256
It's not a weird thing that
I wanna have sex with you...

1513
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:38,236
because you are very sexy...

1514
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,516
and you were leading me on,
and we are in Hawaii...

1515
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:42,560
which is a sexy place,
and people have sex here.

1516
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,995
God, dude, you built this
all up in your head.

1517
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:47,037
Alice and I just
saw you on TV...

1518
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,998
wanted to go to Hawaii.
Hold up.

1519
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:51,040
Fuck.

1520
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:52,240
You saw us on TV?

1521
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,391
No, I don't even
watch Wendy Williams.

1522
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:00,640
What?

1523
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:03,433
What?
Shh!

1524
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:04,839
I thought you dug me.

1525
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,274
Are you even a teacher?

1526
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,280
No.

1527
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:11,480
What about little Julio...

1528
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,750
the dyslexic boy
who you taught how to read?

1529
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,275
Made it up. All of it.

1530
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:17,440
Although I did have sex

1531
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:18,800
with this guy
name Julio once...

1532
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,359
and I'm pretty sure
he couldn't read.

1533
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:22,656
Here I thought
you were Michelle Pfeiffer

1534
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:23,829
from Dangerous Minds.

1535
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,150
Turns out, you're Michelle Pfeiffer
from Scarface.

1536
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,313
And you didn't even

1537
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:31,790
say hello to my little friend.

1538
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,277
Oh, come on, man.

1539
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,389
Mike.

1540
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:55,876
I'm really sorry. Um...

1541
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,076
I've been acting crazy.

1542
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:02,039
It's probably about Luke,
my ex.

1543
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:05,271
Oh, yeah. The guy who
died in the plane crash...

1544
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:08,076
with cancer,
and AIDS, and stuff.

1545
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:09,958
Yeah, that's the one.

1546
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,756
Except none of that
stuff happened, 'cause, um...

1547
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:18,198
I lied.

1548
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:19,360
You lied?

1549
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:21,712
I can't do this.

1550
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:22,880
Wait.

1551
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:24,115
Sorry.

1552
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:25,349
That's okay. That's okay.

1553
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:26,794
Sorry everyone.

1554
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:30,071
I just forgot my phone.
Can I grab my phone?

1555
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,630
Sorry, I still don't want
to get married.

1556
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:37,435
Oh, my gosh.

1557
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:40,473
That's almost as bad
as the plane crash story.

1558
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:42,799
Why didn't you just tell me?

1559
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,950
I didn't want you to think
I was damaged goods.

1560
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:49,912
I would never think that.

1561
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:51,954
"Love hurts.

1562
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,632
"Love scars.

1563
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:58,588
"Love wounds, and mars."

1564
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:03,792
That's from a really old song,
for old people.

1565
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:06,917
Why are you so nice?

1566
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,831
'Cause I think you're nice.

1567
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:20,080
David!

1568
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,633
David, I need you here
with me now. Come on.

1569
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,028
No. No.

1570
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:27,835
Stangles, assemble. Now!

1571
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,718
Let's go.
Is he okay?

1572
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:30,800
Yeah, I think he's fine.

1573
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,016
He's just got
a lot on his mind.

1574
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:33,040
Let's go!

1575
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:34,712
Okay, I'm coming, dude.
Jeez.

1576
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:38,709
Oh... I...

1577
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:40,711
You gave me a boost up. Okay.

1578
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:49,919
A line has been drawn, David.

1579
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,628
A clear line in the sand.

1580
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,376
Is that why you brought me
all the way down here...

1581
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,516
so you could literally
draw a line in the sand?

1582
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:57,794
I'm a visual thinker, David.

1583
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,154
God damn it!
Son of a...

1584
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:03,238
These girls,
they've gotta go.

1585
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:05,038
They pretended to dig us

1586
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:07,509
just to get
a free trip to Hawaii.

1587
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:08,954
They're liars!

1588
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:11,156
So what, man? So they lied.

1589
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:12,993
I was talking to Alice.

1590
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:14,991
You have no idea
what this girl's been through.

1591
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:17,674
She needed this trip.
We might have saved her life.

1592
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:20,918
We should be practicing
our speech for tonight.

1593
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,434
Not babysitting the twins
from The Shining.

1594
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:27,753
Oh, my God.

1595
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:29,279
Why are you laughing at me?

1596
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,576
You sound like mom and dad
when they're talking about us.

1597
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,511
Well, no, fuck that noise.

1598
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:35,678
Oh. Oh. Oh.

1599
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:37,313
Guess what!
You're gonna love this.

1600
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:41,359
Tatiana was jerking off
our cousin Terry.

1601
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:43,192
What?
Mmm-hmm.

1602
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,395
Cousin Terry has a dick?

1603
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:46,318
No, not "jerking off"
jerking off.

1604
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,595
The female version
of jerking.

1605
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:50,432
Dude, let's just chill out...

1606
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:52,716
focus on Jeanie,
and try not to be assholes...

1607
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,256
for the rest of the weekend,
okay? Can we do that?

1608
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:55,918
I can't do that, David.

1609
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:58,396
Because I saw
our little sister...

1610
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:00,240
What?

1611
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:03,509
Well, let's just say
she was making this face...

1612
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:07,598
What? She saw a ghost?

1613
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:11,153
She really had to pee?

1614
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:13,520
Doing vocal warmups?

1615
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:16,096
What are you doing? It looks
like you're having an orgasm.

1616
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:19,430
She was, David!
With the masseuse.

1617
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,319
What!
Yes!

1618
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:22,669
Oh, my God!

1619
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:23,800
She orgasms like a star.

1620
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:24,949
No!

1621
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,189
What's next?

1622
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:30,911
I'm gonna walk in on mom
giving dad a Push Pop?

1623
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:32,635
What's a Push Pop?

1624
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:34,318
I made it up, Dave.

1625
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:36,078
It's a sexual term
that I just made up.

1626
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:37,434
What's a Push Pop?

1627
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:38,788
I don't know.

1628
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,711
What's a Push Pop?
I don't know!

1629
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:41,994
What's a Push Pop?

1630
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:43,416
I've been to the bowels
of the Internet,

1631
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:44,640
and I've never seen
a Push Pop.

1632
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:46,352
God, just tell me!
What's a Push Pop?

1633
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:48,431
It's a whole hand
up an ass, David.

1634
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:50,511
Is that what
you want me to say?

1635
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:54,036
Oh, God!
Two hands pushin' the pop.

1636
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:56,230
Oh, God. Is that what
you want me to say?

1637
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:57,878
I'll send you some links.

1638
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:18,240
We're at table two.

1639
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:19,360
I'll be at the bar.

1640
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:21,033
I said table two.
I'll be at the bar!

1641
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:22,394
You're out of control!

1642
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:24,240
Thank you.

1643
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:26,918
Trouble in paradise?

1644
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:33,953
Freaking I don't care
if I cause a scene.

1645
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:36,588
Freaking I will punch you
17,000 times

1646
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:38,079
in the face. Freaking.

1647
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:39,240
Take a shot.

1648
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:42,280
You look like Don Johnson
fucked Zack Morris.

1649
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,416
Wait till Tatiana
hears your shitty speech

1650
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:45,919
after my crazy dope one.

1651
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:47,840
She's never gonna
touch your baby bird again.

1652
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:51,192
Thriller-Terry out!

1653
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,359
So sad!

1654
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:55,856
Oh, my God.
It's a movie about cameras

1655
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:57,108
just following you everywhere.

1656
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:58,400
Like The Truman Show.

1657
01:01:58,480 --> 01:01:59,776
Yeah! Exactly like
The Truman Show!

1658
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:01,472
Hey, Dave! Dave!

1659
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:02,868
Hey, what's up?

1660
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:04,216
I need you to come
backstage right now

1661
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:05,719
and practice the speech.

1662
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:06,949
Uh...

1663
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:09,150
Dude, I'm kind of
talking to Alice right now.

1664
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:11,216
Which is a conversation
you've now interrupted twice.

1665
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:12,434
Our speech needs to kill.

1666
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:14,636
Terry got a punch up
from Chris Rock.

1667
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:16,096
I didn't want to
tell you before

1668
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:17,456
because I didn't want
you to freak out.

1669
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:18,480
I'm not freaking out.

1670
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:19,993
Calm the fuck down, Dave!

1671
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:21,275
You calm the fuck down!

1672
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:23,192
Mike, you look like
your face is gonna pop.

1673
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:25,237
You gonna come or what?

1674
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:26,719
Let's go.

1675
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,392
I'll see you backstage.

1676
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:31,915
Uh...

1677
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,056
I'm gonna go deal
with this real quick.

1678
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:34,080
Okay.

1679
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:36,071
I'll just talk to myself
for a while. All alone.

1680
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:41,117
...look on your stupid face!

1681
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:42,713
What's wrong with me?

1682
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,496
Don't fucking
look at her. Turn around.

1683
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:45,919
Everybody get the fuck
out of here.

1684
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,353
Fuck you, Luke.

1685
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:50,274
I'm just gonna have
a little lie down, okay?

1686
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:03,389
Hi!

1687
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:04,993
Hi!
Hi!

1688
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:07,196
Did you need to take
a little breather, too?

1689
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:08,793
No. Why? Are you?

1690
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,313
Well...

1691
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:12,393
You know, you think that

1692
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:14,391
every moment
is going to feel...

1693
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:16,789
warm and glowy...

1694
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,677
and absolutely magical.

1695
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:21,718
But, then,
some stuff happens.

1696
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:23,835
Sure does.
Yeah.

1697
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:29,477
Well, if you want warm,
glowy and magical...

1698
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:31,395
I have just the thing.

1699
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:33,234
I don't leave
home without it.

1700
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:37,593
Ecstasy!
Oh!

1701
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,136
Every bride deserves
to have a little fun

1702
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:40,309
the night before
her wedding!

1703
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,356
Yeah. I deserve to
have a little fun.

1704
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:45,312
You are so nice to me.

1705
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:46,560
Aww.

1706
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:50,680
This is gonna be
so much fun!

1707
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:53,216
We should find
something to suck on.

1708
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:54,240
What? Oh.

1709
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:55,320
Mike!

1710
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:56,594
Here. Put these on.

1711
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:58,634
We need headsets?
Yeah!

1712
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,275
There's a lot of dancing in our speech,
my man. Right?

1713
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:02,554
Gotta go hands free.

1714
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:04,153
This is how we
do it, baby.

1715
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,310
Come on. Hey,
check this out.

1716
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,436
I'm going to "wedding crash"
cousin Terry.

1717
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:09,555
What?

1718
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:10,736
Put a few eye drops
in her drink.

1719
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:12,576
That way she shits all night,
and can't do the speech.

1720
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:13,896
Just like in the movie
Wedding Crashers.

1721
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:15,672
Mike, that is
a terrible idea.

1722
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:16,875
You've seen the movie!

1723
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:18,096
Of course
I've seen the movie.

1724
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:19,997
You love that movie.
Everyone loves that movie.

1725
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:21,536
How's it a bad idea
if you love the movie?

1726
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:23,576
I love Taken. I don't want
to go steal little girls.

1727
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:25,336
But we shouldn't wedding
crash our own cousin.

1728
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:26,554
I'm worried about you, man.

1729
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:28,520
I'm really worried that
you're losing your mind.

1730
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:30,278
The look in your eyes
right now...

1731
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,436
You haven't blinked since
we've started talking.

1732
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:33,953
Oh, Davie, Davie, Davie!

1733
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:35,269
What?

1734
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:38,274
I've never been in more
control in my entire life.

1735
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:42,077
Mike!

1736
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:43,997
Whoo!
Ugh. Mike!

1737
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:45,919
This is really intense.

1738
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:48,256
Yeah,
it's hitting me really hard.

1739
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:50,111
This is good ecstasy.

1740
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:52,560
I don't know. I wouldn't know.
It's my first time.

1741
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:53,953
Wait, what?
What?

1742
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:56,395
Why would you take ecstasy
for the first time

1743
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:57,879
on the night
before your wedding?

1744
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:58,960
What?

1745
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:00,433
That is so baller!

1746
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:03,157
Like a tiny blonde gangsta!

1747
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:04,440
This little gangsta
would kill

1748
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:05,680
for a motherfucking
ginger ale!

1749
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:07,829
Do you wanna go?
Mmm-hmm.

1750
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:09,393
Okay, let's go.

1751
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:11,311
Hello, everyone.
Please take your seats.

1752
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:13,551
Welcome to
the rehearsal dinner...

1753
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:15,992
for my man, Eric...

1754
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:18,429
and his bride-to-be,
the lovely Jeanie.

1755
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:21,438
They're two of the sweetest,
best people I ever met.

1756
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:23,830
All right.
Our first speaker tonight...

1757
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,757
is resident nasty girl...

1758
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:26,909
Cousin Terry.

1759
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:29,873
We can't let Terry crush.

1760
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:31,275
It's not fair!

1761
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:32,509
No. Give it to me.

1762
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:34,358
My eyes are dry.
Just give it to me.

1763
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:36,358
Do you guys know
who Chris Rock is?

1764
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:38,472
He's my neighbor,
and he helped me out

1765
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:40,160
with a little something
I like to call...

1766
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:41,553
"my speech."

1767
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:44,279
Stop. You're wasting it.
You're wasting the poison.

1768
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:45,429
Mike, this is baby safe.

1769
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:46,880
They removed
the active ingredient,

1770
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:48,478
Tetrahydrozoline,
like 20 years ago!

1771
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:49,754
It worked on
Wedding Crashers!

1772
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:51,393
That was not real life!

1773
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:54,074
Now let's talk about
destination weddings!

1774
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:56,193
It's like a vacation...

1775
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:58,111
without the relaxation!

1776
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:00,955
That's true.

1777
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:02,280
Why aren't you
on my side, Dave?

1778
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:03,520
What?

1779
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:04,720
I'm done with
this shit, man.

1780
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:06,040
I'm not doing
our stupid speech.

1781
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:08,430
In fact, I'm quitting
our liquor business.

1782
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:09,589
There it is!

1783
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:10,875
Really?
Yeah.

1784
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,069
And what are you
gonna do?

1785
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:13,599
I'm gonna draw!

1786
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:15,272
I'm gonna work on
my graphic novel,

1787
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:16,856
and Mom's gonna help me
cover the rent.

1788
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:17,915
Boom!

1789
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:19,160
You traitor!

1790
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:20,440
I ain't gotta rehearse!

1791
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:22,597
I know how to eat dinner.

1792
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:27,280
Keith, can you turn
me up a little bit?

1793
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:29,376
You turn your back on me...

1794
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:30,719
when everyone else does.

1795
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:32,080
Backstabbing, treacherous...

1796
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:33,948
lying coward!

1797
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:35,496
Ooh, I don't think
they know they're on.

1798
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:36,919
What? Where is
that coming from?

1799
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:38,508
I don't know what I did!

1800
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:39,959
It doesn't matter, Mike.

1801
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:41,393
You're losing your mind.

1802
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:43,596
You just tried to
poison our cousin Terry!

1803
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:46,160
Try a little harder.
Am I right?

1804
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:47,355
You're goddamn
right I did.

1805
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:48,799
Because I wanted
her to shit

1806
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,518
hot brown poop
all over that stage.

1807
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:52,759
That is unacceptable.

1808
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:54,671
The mics are on, boys.

1809
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:57,672
I wanted her butt to explode
like a rotten cantaloupe.

1810
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:58,909
The mics are on!

1811
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,433
You're just fucking
pissed off

1812
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:02,112
because Tatiana
finger diddled Terry.

1813
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:04,072
There it is!

1814
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:07,112
It was for tickets
to Rihanna.

1815
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:09,117
You're sad, man.
You are sad.

1816
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:12,114
I'm gonna kick your ass
just like when we were kids.

1817
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:17,948
Oh!
My God!

1818
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:21,428
Do you wanna go?
Don't do it!

1819
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:22,748
These are coming
your way.

1820
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:23,875
Just stop!

1821
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,672
God! That had to hurt.

1822
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,274
Don't do it again.

1823
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:29,800
Oh!

1824
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:33,336
Why do you
keep punching me?

1825
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:34,760
Why do you
keep rushing at me?

1826
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:36,069
Get him, Dave.

1827
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:37,309
Oops, who said that?

1828
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:38,992
This wedding is
going to hell!

1829
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:40,269
Yes.

1830
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:42,476
They're out there,
smiling like fucking idiots.

1831
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,195
And they don't
realize the bride...

1832
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:47,271
is getting off
at massage parlors...

1833
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:49,635
like a goddamn
Vietnam War veteran.

1834
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:52,536
I think they misunderstood
what happened.

1835
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:53,800
I think they just
misunderstood.

1836
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:55,956
I walked in
and saw little Jeanie...

1837
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:57,837
the bride-to-be, orgasming.

1838
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:00,275
The masseuse got her off.

1839
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:01,759
God damn it!

1840
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:02,875
Jeanie!

1841
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:04,320
I hate you!

1842
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:20,197
The rehearsal
dinner is over.

1843
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:23,872
Drinks by the pool, everybody.
Drinks by the pool.

1844
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:30,080
Everything feels
so good, right?

1845
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:31,200
Yep.

1846
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:33,176
You know what I've been
thinking about a lot?

1847
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:34,269
Tell me.

1848
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,271
Eric is so sweet
and sensitive.

1849
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:38,396
Kind, good, fiancé.

1850
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:40,040
Probably great husband
and stuff, but...

1851
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:42,917
Do you think Eric is boring?

1852
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,035
Boring?

1853
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,269
Like for my honeymoon...

1854
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:47,836
all I wanted to do was go
on a hot air balloon...

1855
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:49,717
to different countries
around the world.

1856
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:52,030
And just be surrounded
by wicker.

1857
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:53,633
We could have
wicker picnic baskets...

1858
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:56,188
and I could make
picnic hats out of wicker.

1859
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:58,471
We would be wearing
matching Chuck Taylors.

1860
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,391
And he vetoed it.
Oh!

1861
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:03,189
Because he wants to
go to a resort, and just...

1862
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:06,793
...perch.
What?

1863
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:07,949
I am a young woman...

1864
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:09,080
Preach!

1865
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:10,376
There is so much
for me to see.

1866
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:11,400
Yes.

1867
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:12,880
I haven't even
been to Burning Man.

1868
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:15,395
I don't even know
what Amsterdam is like.

1869
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:17,478
I haven't been to Seattle.

1870
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:18,874
You've never
been to Seattle?

1871
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:19,995
No!

1872
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:21,376
Seattle's gonna change
your fucking life!

1873
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:22,400
Really?

1874
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:23,800
You need to get out
of this cage!

1875
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:24,875
I am in a cage...

1876
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:27,394
just like these
horses are caged.

1877
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:29,471
Just let them out.

1878
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:30,720
Huh?

1879
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:33,229
Let them all out.

1880
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:42,319
Be free!
No one can hold you down!

1881
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:45,517
Be free, my friends!
Follow your dreams!

1882
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:12,348
Here to pile on?

1883
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:13,760
Go ahead.

1884
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:15,114
Any insult
you can think of...

1885
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:16,816
I've probably told myself
a million times.

1886
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:18,512
Why were you trying to
poison your cousin?

1887
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:25,919
I was jealous of the whole
steam room incident.

1888
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,228
That is some crazy shit.

1889
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:28,799
That's like something
I would do.

1890
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:30,678
This one time
in high school...

1891
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:32,296
this bitch tried to
hit on my boyfriend...

1892
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:33,976
and I cut off her ponytail
while she was sleeping...

1893
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,433
and I wore it to
school for a month.

1894
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:36,635
What the fuck?

1895
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:38,278
But you tried to
poison your cousin.

1896
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:54,718
Look. I'm sorry I've been
so rough on you, okay?

1897
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:58,669
I honestly think it's because
you're so much like me.

1898
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:00,836
You act all confident...

1899
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:03,912
but, inside, you're
scared of everything.

1900
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:05,936
You act like you don't care
what people think...

1901
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:07,518
but you really care
what people think.

1902
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:08,834
And you try
to act so smart...

1903
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:10,558
but sometimes...

1904
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:11,868
you're just afraid

1905
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:13,837
you're the dumbest
person in the world.

1906
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:18,192
I'm so dumb.

1907
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:20,193
I'm constantly
saying words

1908
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:22,197
that I don't know
the meaning of.

1909
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:25,189
Like, I use this word,
"assuage"...

1910
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:26,839
all the time.

1911
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:29,031
Can you assuage me
the ketchup?

1912
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:31,077
Can I assuage you
a few questions?

1913
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:32,872
Is that the meaning of it?

1914
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,069
I don't know.

1915
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:35,633
But it's like,
I'm so stupid...

1916
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:37,950
but I act all confident,
so people listen to me.

1917
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:39,109
And it's fucked up.

1918
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:41,197
Me, too.
I'm a natural born leader.

1919
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:43,198
Like George Washington.

1920
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:44,395
Yeah.

1921
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:45,708
Or another leader.

1922
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:54,633
All right, here's one.

1923
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:56,790
But I'm about to get super
real with you. Okay?

1924
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:01,909
I thought I was destined
for such great things...

1925
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:04,679
but I may never
achieve anything.

1926
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:09,434
Sister.

1927
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:12,751
Have you been
reading my diary?

1928
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:22,835
Yes.

1929
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:24,915
Okay.

1930
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:38,674
You are beautiful!

1931
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:40,113
On to Seattle!

1932
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:41,395
Alice?

1933
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:43,440
Am I glowing?

1934
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:45,352
I can see sounds
and hear colors.

1935
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:47,198
Be free!

1936
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:48,952
What the fuck are the
horses doing out?

1937
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:51,273
Who the fuck are you guys?

1938
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:52,788
Fucking gypsies!

1939
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:55,076
Francisco!
Francisco, run!

1940
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:57,396
Whoa! Shit!

1941
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:01,275
Hey.

1942
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:02,952
Dave! Hi.

1943
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:05,874
What's up?
What's up with you?

1944
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:07,056
What's going on?
Are you okay?

1945
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:08,229
Me?

1946
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:10,556
Yeah. I'm fine.

1947
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:13,753
Oh. Yeah. Well...

1948
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:16,117
Yeah. See,
what happened was that...

1949
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:17,395
there was a tsunami,

1950
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:18,616
and it took away
our clothes...

1951
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:19,868
but it brought
these horses.

1952
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:20,960
What?

1953
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:22,096
And then, we wanted
to get naked

1954
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:23,235
because of Lady Godiva...

1955
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:25,117
but then horses
can't eat chocolate.

1956
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:27,236
They could have
an aneurysm.

1957
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:28,594
Where's Jeanie?

1958
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:30,136
Hey, don't yell at her
just because she's the one...

1959
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:31,760
that told me to go to Seattle.
Holy shit!

1960
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:33,432
I've always wanted to go!
Oh, my God!

1961
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:35,317
That is not
her fault.

1962
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:36,833
Oh, my eyes!
What's the matter?

1963
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,656
Stop yelling. Why are you
yelling? David, stop yelling.

1964
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:40,318
You're being loud.
And this a happy time.

1965
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:41,839
This a really good time.

1966
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,176
There's nothing wrong.
So who's at fault?

1967
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:44,520
Did you know that
Hitler's parents

1968
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:45,600
were second cousins?

1969
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:47,480
Do you have any water?
Put your clothes on!

1970
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,670
I'm a woman, Dave.
Deal with it.

1971
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:54,629
Because this is the bush
that you came out of.

1972
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:56,153
I didn't come
from that bush.

1973
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:57,992
I came from Mom's bush.
And you know that.

1974
01:13:58,200 --> 01:13:59,599
Jeanie! Oh, my God!

1975
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:01,473
You're completely naked!

1976
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:02,709
Hi, Becky!

1977
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:03,989
God, your bush
is huge.

1978
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:05,832
You look tall.
No, ma'am.

1979
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:08,395
I told you to stay away
from these bitches.

1980
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:10,830
Alice, seriously,
are you tripping?

1981
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,000
No. God, no.

1982
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:13,075
Why would say that?

1983
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:14,496
Just because everything
feels really soft?

1984
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:16,112
Please.
Just tell me the truth.

1985
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:17,349
Are you on drugs?

1986
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:19,633
We're super
fucked up. Yeah.

1987
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:20,800
What?

1988
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:21,880
We started with ecstasy,

1989
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,416
but then I went into
my mystery bags.

1990
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:24,839
Why the fuck
would you do that?

1991
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,194
Don't you
judge me, David.

1992
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:28,096
I don't think you're supposed
to go into the mystery bag...

1993
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:29,240
the night before
the wedding.

1994
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:31,656
We brought you here because we
thought you were nice girls.

1995
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:33,511
But Mike was right
about you two.

1996
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:35,875
This whole wedding weekend
is just going to shit!

1997
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:37,871
Dave, I'll be
honest with you.

1998
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:39,189
I need some clothes.

1999
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:41,673
I can't continue
to wear this horse.

2000
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:43,398
Oh, my God.

2001
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:45,233
Oh, the wind feels
so nice.

2002
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:46,628
Come on, come on,
come on.

2003
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:50,315
We should
go in the ocean.

2004
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:52,470
I'm so thirsty! Dave, we
should get in the ocean.

2005
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:55,757
Please, please,
please, just be quiet.

2006
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:57,319
I love this song.

2007
01:14:57,400 --> 01:14:58,753
There's no music playing.

2008
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:00,880
Baby, wait.

2009
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:02,917
Don't worry.
Only our butts touched.

2010
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:05,036
Stop it. Don't freak out
anymore, Pumpkin!

2011
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:07,236
Don't freak out?
Don't freak out?

2012
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:08,759
Tell me one thing.

2013
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,194
Did you enjoy it?

2014
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:12,398
No.

2015
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:14,713
That is such a "yes" no.

2016
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:15,835
No.

2017
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:18,354
I'm gonna ask you again.
Did you enjoy it?

2018
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:19,440
Yes! Oh.

2019
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:20,515
Well...

2020
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:22,352
Cat's out of
the frigging bag, isn't it?

2021
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:24,431
I went for
a normal massage...

2022
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:26,640
but Alice, she had asked
for a little special treat.

2023
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:28,816
And then it just kept coming,
and coming, and coming, and...

2024
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:29,880
Who are these
fucking girls

2025
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:31,376
your brothers brought
to this wedding?

2026
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:33,960
You are clearly
on drugs.

2027
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:35,553
And we're getting
married tomorrow!

2028
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,231
I'm scared, Pumpkin.

2029
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:39,594
Aren't you scared?

2030
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:41,631
Well, yeah, now I am.

2031
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:43,439
It's just that...

2032
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:48,591
I'm just a little worried
that you are...

2033
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:51,120
boring.

2034
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:53,959
What are you saying?

2035
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:55,348
You don't want
to marry me?

2036
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:07,468
Well...

2037
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:09,416
No, she doesn't mean that.
She's just confused...

2038
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:10,776
because she's just rolling
super hard right now.

2039
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:11,949
You rolled her!

2040
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:13,120
You're the roller!

2041
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:14,160
I'm so sorry.

2042
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:16,709
I was gonna draw Rum for you.
But not anymore.

2043
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:18,876
Everything is not irie, man!

2044
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:23,914
You've made me so,
so sad.

2045
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:27,833
But a little bit mad.

2046
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:29,993
But mostly just sad.

2047
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Oh!

2048
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,274
Dad!
Don't!

2049
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:36,833
Mike, for once
in your life...

2050
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,992
please don't say
a fucking word.

2051
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:06,192
I hate them sometimes.

2052
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:07,696
Fucking love them
and they're dicks.

2053
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:09,480
Sometimes I love them,
sometimes I hate them.

2054
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:18,600
Everything okay
over there?

2055
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:21,075
I can't find my other sock.
It's pissing me off.

2056
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,718
Did you take
my sock, bro?

2057
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:26,949
No.

2058
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:29,835
I think you took
my fucking sock, bro.

2059
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:32,549
God damn it.

2060
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:34,896
I can't believe Jeanie and
Eric aren't getting married...

2061
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:36,717
and it's all our fault.

2062
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:40,358
It's slightly our fault.

2063
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:43,231
It's totally
our fault. Fuck.

2064
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:45,755
We got selfish.
We got distracted.

2065
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:50,158
I don't think we were
#DoingltForJeanie at all.

2066
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:52,197
We weren't
#DoingltForJeanie.

2067
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:53,509
Our fucking little sister.

2068
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:55,192
Our little
Jeanie Beanie Weanie.

2069
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:57,757
She is Stanglita.

2070
01:17:57,920 --> 01:18:00,673
The one little girl we used to
let into our Stang Hangs.

2071
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:01,840
The Stangle Dangle.

2072
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:03,433
The smallest plane
in the Stangar.

2073
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:04,749
Don't do it, dude.

2074
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:06,280
We're supposed to be
her protector.

2075
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:07,913
Don't you cry.

2076
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:09,256
We're supposed to
look out for her.

2077
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:10,429
Stop it.

2078
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:12,033
We're supposed
to be the two dudes

2079
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:13,519
that have her back
no matter what.

2080
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:15,113
If you start,
I'm gonna start.

2081
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:17,555
We broke up her marriage.

2082
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:21,952
Of course I'm fucking
doing it, man.

2083
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:23,274
We ruined
Jeanie's wedding.

2084
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:24,873
I'm doing it, too.

2085
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:26,793
I hate it.

2086
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:42,074
Oh, man, we fucked
up this wedding.

2087
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:43,160
Yeah.

2088
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:45,510
We fucked it
in the dick.

2089
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:48,496
You know I don't like it when you say that.
That's just...

2090
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:51,318
I know, but we fucked it
so hard. Fuck.

2091
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:52,760
I think the reason
we get ourselves

2092
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,552
into so much shit is...

2093
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:55,656
we're always
telling each other

2094
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:56,680
we're so awesome...

2095
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,992
when we're definitely
not being awesome.

2096
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:01,434
That's deep.

2097
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:03,397
Yeah, you know what?
Um...

2098
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,831
I wanted you
to feel better...

2099
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,150
and get your groove back...

2100
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:12,471
but not all the way
better to where...

2101
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:15,911
you wouldn't
need me anymore.

2102
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:18,992
Because if you
don't need me...

2103
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:23,159
then nobody needs me,
and, um...

2104
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:25,136
Anyway, that's what
I was thinking

2105
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:27,071
when I was knuckles deep
into Cousin Terry.

2106
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:29,671
Dude, we're always
gonna need each other.

2107
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:31,360
Okay.

2108
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:32,953
Okay, here's the thing.

2109
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:35,638
I don't wanna
stop being us.

2110
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:37,836
But I think
occasionally...

2111
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:42,272
we should think about how
we make other people feel.

2112
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:45,560
Like Jeanie?

2113
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:46,868
Yeah, like Jeanie.

2114
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:49,038
Oof.
Or like Eric.

2115
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:50,515
Oh, fuck.

2116
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:52,312
This feels
fucking terrible.

2117
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:54,710
This does not feel good.

2118
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:57,633
Like, Dave's
so special and...

2119
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:00,715
He must be
so mad at me.

2120
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:02,195
Poor Mike.

2121
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:05,710
He's less special,
but I played him so hard.

2122
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:07,359
They must be
so mad at us!

2123
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:09,715
They must hate us. Fuck!
I would hate us.

2124
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:11,677
I would fucking
hate us!

2125
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:14,195
I hate us, man.
I hate us!

2126
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:15,475
I hate us, too!

2127
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:17,358
But you're the best, dude.
I love you.

2128
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:19,829
Don't lump yourself
in with me.

2129
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:21,473
I'm like
a little troll...

2130
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:22,640
who lives
on nothing but

2131
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:24,392
river water
and squirrel meats.

2132
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:26,994
Your drawing? I could never
do anything like that.

2133
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:28,229
So go.
You go right now.

2134
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:29,320
What?

2135
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:30,469
Go!

2136
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:33,916
Don't let your loser older
brother hold you back.

2137
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:38,753
You are not a loser.

2138
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:41,079
Thanks, Dave.

2139
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:42,896
Dude, you introduced me
to the Ninja Turtles.

2140
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:44,751
Taught me Donatello
was a pussy.

2141
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:46,751
That Raphael
was actually dope...

2142
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:48,911
because he didn't give a
fuck what people thought.

2143
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:50,354
He's cool, but rude.

2144
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:51,748
Exactly.

2145
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:52,896
When all those kids
kicked at me

2146
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:54,016
and they called me
"Moist"...

2147
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:55,439
you stopped
eating muffins

2148
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:56,913
at the school lunch
for a year.

2149
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:58,758
They were too moist.

2150
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:01,757
Made you
an easy target.

2151
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:05,430
You're my brother.
And I love you.

2152
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:07,192
Heroes in a half shell.

2153
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:08,429
Turtle power.

2154
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:15,750
We're not
going anywhere...

2155
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:19,595
until our little sister,
Jeanie Beanie Weanie...

2156
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:21,478
is getting married.

2157
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:28,394
You just killed
the TV.

2158
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:30,638
I was aiming for it.

2159
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:35,918
We are such idiots.
We are so stupid.

2160
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:37,599
We ruined
your whole wedding...

2161
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:39,478
and we finally
just realized that.

2162
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:41,596
All right. Please just
stop talking, okay?

2163
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:44,957
Not another word.
My head hurts so bad.

2164
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:46,314
Jeanie, Eric.

2165
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:47,720
We can't let you
not get married

2166
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:49,280
just because we
fucked everything up.

2167
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:50,536
We love you
so much, Jeanie.

2168
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:51,560
We love you, Eric.

2169
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:52,736
We just want you guys
to love each other.

2170
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:54,000
Just love each other.
That's it.

2171
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:57,068
Jeanie, Eric.

2172
01:21:57,240 --> 01:21:58,753
We can't let you
not get married.

2173
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:00,656
Yeah. Just because
we fucked everything up?

2174
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:02,256
I mean, we want you guys
to love each other.

2175
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:03,280
Love each other.

2176
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:05,913
Okay.
This is bizarre,

2177
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,319
because we literally
did that...

2178
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:08,839
...exact same thing.

2179
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,672
We're even doing
this hand motion.

2180
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:11,989
Yeah, all that
was ours.

2181
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:14,151
The point is, this
shit is all our fault.

2182
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:15,998
No, it's our fault.

2183
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:17,838
No, it's definitely
our fault.

2184
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,115
It is our fault
for sure.

2185
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:20,280
No, no, no. For real.

2186
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:21,839
If anything,
it's my fault.

2187
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:25,192
Shh! Please stop.

2188
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:31,553
Everyone shut the fuck up!

2189
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:34,549
Jesus Hussein Christ.

2190
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:36,716
God damn it!

2191
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:39,070
Been trying to read
this same paragraph...

2192
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:40,639
for 20 minutes.

2193
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:45,191
But you four fucking morons
keep on fucking with my shit.

2194
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:47,558
We've only been here
for three minutes...

2195
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:48,800
so those other 17 minutes...

2196
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:50,074
that's kind of on you...
Mike!

2197
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:51,434
I'm using hyperbole.

2198
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,640
I don't know
what that means,

2199
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:54,358
and I think you
know that I don't.

2200
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:56,471
Mike, do me a favor.
Shut the fuck up.

2201
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:57,560
Go Eric.

2202
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:58,635
Shut up too!

2203
01:22:58,720 --> 01:22:59,994
I mean, God damn it!

2204
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:03,317
You're all self-absorbed,
barely-functioning...

2205
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:05,108
codependent weirdos!

2206
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:07,554
Yeah.
I know.

2207
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:08,696
That's pretty spot-on.

2208
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:09,936
We just
figured that out.

2209
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:12,679
Those are not good qualities.
We're gonna work on it.

2210
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:14,791
It's been a long time.
It's been so many years.

2211
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:16,438
We're both very confused.

2212
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:18,676
No, no.
You're not confused.

2213
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:20,876
You're just coming
down off MDMA.

2214
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:22,393
Sorry. Which I gave you.

2215
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:23,760
And Eric, you can't blame her

2216
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:25,233
for anything
she said last night.

2217
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:28,198
I've done so much
stupid shit on E.

2218
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:30,920
I got so dehydrated that
I was drinking puddle water...

2219
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:32,400
and I had to go
to the hospital...

2220
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:35,034
'cause puddles
are really dirty.

2221
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:36,679
One time
I was on peyote...

2222
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:38,990
and I signed up
for a T-Mobile plan.

2223
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:40,832
One time I got high.

2224
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:43,434
I read the back of a shampoo
bottle for 13 hours.

2225
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:45,629
Because it said "repeat."

2226
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:47,278
Rinse and repeat.
I get it.

2227
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:50,397
Jeanie, I know you think
that Eric can be boring...

2228
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:53,279
Enough of this
talk of boring!

2229
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:54,875
Damn it!

2230
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:56,518
Sixty percent
of my investments

2231
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:59,114
are in some pretty
aggressive stocks.

2232
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:02,636
I don't always look both ways
when I cross the street.

2233
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:05,792
I've been known to have
a second glass of wine...

2234
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:07,711
with my dinner,
every now and then.

2235
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:09,438
I once went to
see a movie...

2236
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:11,988
walked across the hallway,
saw a second movie.

2237
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:13,399
Didn't pay till after.

2238
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:14,749
Is that boring?

2239
01:24:15,240 --> 01:24:16,240
Is that boring?

2240
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:17,469
What'd you say?
Yeah.

2241
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:19,496
You're right. We were wrong.
That was pretty boring.

2242
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:20,760
Well, how about this
for boring?

2243
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:24,358
Bam!

2244
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:26,280
Two hot air balloon tickets
for our honeymoon.

2245
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:28,560
I know you really
wanted to go...

2246
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:31,478
so I got these tickets
a while ago to surprise you.

2247
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:33,631
Surprise.

2248
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:35,950
Aww!

2249
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:37,639
Baby, you're so
afraid of heights.

2250
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:39,576
Baby, I'm fucking
terrified of heights.

2251
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:40,749
Yeah.

2252
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:43,276
But my biggest fear...

2253
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:45,476
is to not be the husband
that you deserve.

2254
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:49,673
Baby, I'm sorry
I fucked so much of this up...

2255
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:51,520
but I promise
that masseuse...

2256
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:53,591
He didn't touch
my lavender juice box.

2257
01:24:53,680 --> 01:24:55,511
Oh God, baby. I love you.

2258
01:24:56,040 --> 01:24:57,792
And I know
I want to marry you.

2259
01:24:58,120 --> 01:25:00,998
Today, if you'll
still have me.

2260
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:03,954
Babe, of course.
Are you kidding me?

2261
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:08,440
Kiss her.

2262
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:10,351
Baby, I'm crazy
about you.

2263
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:23,840
Aww!

2264
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:26,033
I want to marry you
right now...

2265
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:28,156
but, baby, we already
canceled all the vendors.

2266
01:25:28,680 --> 01:25:30,840
I don't think they're going
to let us get married here.

2267
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:32,995
Leave that to us.

2268
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:36,112
Leave that to
all of us.

2269
01:25:37,480 --> 01:25:38,595
Yeah!
Let's go, Mike.

2270
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:40,792
This way! Oh, fuck!

2271
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:42,719
We'll actually
just head around.

2272
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:44,439
Girl.
I'm good.

2273
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:46,233
So what part
you like, brah?

2274
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:48,430
We need the whole pig.
I can't give you a whole pig.

2275
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:50,078
But we need to feed 100 people.

2276
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:53,318
Could we please, please
have the wedding here?

2277
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:55,436
For the last time,
we're out of venues.

2278
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:56,856
Hold me back.
Hold me back, please.

2279
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:57,915
What?

2280
01:25:58,200 --> 01:25:59,200
Give us a place!

2281
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:01,077
Everybody out of the way!

2282
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:02,912
It's hot. So hot!

2283
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,680
Out of the fucking way!
I want my pig back!

2284
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:07,037
What if I supplied
all the liquor...

2285
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:09,111
for every bar
in this hotel...

2286
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:11,794
at wholesale prices
for the next three years?

2287
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:13,757
Deal.
Yes! Fuck yes!

2288
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:15,194
I'll get you guys a venue.

2289
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:24,680
Ahh!

2290
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:30,400
Keith, get it together.

2291
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:31,669
We need to move,
move, move.

2292
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:32,989
I'm doing my best.

2293
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:37,755
Hell yeah!

2294
01:26:55,720 --> 01:26:56,720
And now...

2295
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:58,279
a reading...

2296
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:01,076
from the children's book
that I got in the lobby.

2297
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:02,992
Oh.
"Aloha moon.

2298
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:05,078
"Aloha sea.

2299
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:06,633
"Aloha you.

2300
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:08,315
"Aloha me."

2301
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:10,198
I do.
I do.

2302
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:11,720
By the power
vested in me...

2303
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:15,469
by the website
www.beyourowndeacon.com...

2304
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:19,631
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

2305
01:27:19,960 --> 01:27:21,712
Those assholes
kind of did it.

2306
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:23,193
Yeah.

2307
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:25,192
Those assholes
kind of did.

2308
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:26,554
You may kiss the bride.

2309
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:28,153
Okay. Kiss the bride.

2310
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:29,355
Kiss the bride.

2311
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:32,920
Uh-huh.

2312
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:37,720
Yay!

2313
01:27:50,160 --> 01:27:51,752
- You designed this?
- Yeah.

2314
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:54,229
Insane. We're at a wedding,
it's in the shape of a heart.

2315
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:55,833
That was a really
good idea.

2316
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:57,478
I have so many good ideas.

2317
01:27:57,720 --> 01:28:00,393
At my last job,
I was on fire with ideas.

2318
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:02,670
Huh? Actually,
I need a new partner...

2319
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:06,191
because Dave is bailing
on me to draw things.

2320
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:08,193
Would you wanna...

2321
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:09,879
maybe come work for me?

2322
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:11,200
Really?

2323
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:12,873
What do you know
about liquor?

2324
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:16,153
Um, only that it's
delicious and I love it.

2325
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:18,080
And those are the two
things you need to know.

2326
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:19,519
You are hired.

2327
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:21,397
Great. When do I start?

2328
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:22,828
You can start
right away...

2329
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:25,714
but just know that there
will be some late nights.

2330
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:27,512
Keep it in
your pants, okay?

2331
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:29,680
If we're going to work together,
let's just...

2332
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:31,358
keep it professional.

2333
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:32,989
Okay.

2334
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:34,376
We'll keep it
professional, then.

2335
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:35,400
Good.

2336
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:36,480
All right.
Good.

2337
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:37,560
Okay.
Okay.

2338
01:28:37,640 --> 01:28:38,640
Okay.
Yeah.

2339
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:40,199
Are you sure?
I don't know.

2340
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:42,715
What?

2341
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:45,839
What'd you say?
What?

2342
01:28:46,360 --> 01:28:48,510
Love me tender

2343
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:51,031
Love me sweet

2344
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:54,393
Never let me go

2345
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:02,599
You have made
my life complete

2346
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:07,720
I don't.

2347
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:12,751
Love me tender

2348
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:15,238
Love me true

2349
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:20,113
All my dreams fulfilled

2350
01:29:24,120 --> 01:29:27,396
For my darlin' I love you

2351
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:29,477
Tatiana said
this was gonna happen.

2352
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:30,869
You got my groove back.

2353
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:31,960
Really?

2354
01:29:32,040 --> 01:29:34,040
That's the sweetest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

2355
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:41,909
I like you.

2356
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:50,433
Wait. There's
people everywhere.

2357
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:52,590
Let them watch.
Mmm. Okay.

2358
01:29:54,920 --> 01:29:55,955
Whoa!

2359
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:58,232
Hi, everyone.

2360
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:00,675
Excuse us. Could we have
your attention, please?

2361
01:30:02,120 --> 01:30:04,236
My husband and I...

2362
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:08,029
want to thank four
very incredible people...

2363
01:30:08,120 --> 01:30:09,872
for saving the day.

2364
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:13,516
Mike and Dave have asked
to say a few words...

2365
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:15,558
so we would like to
invite them up.

2366
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:16,715
Come on, boys.

2367
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:19,480
Thank you, Jeanie.

2368
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:21,394
We never got to
give our speech

2369
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:23,159
at the rehearsal dinner.

2370
01:30:23,240 --> 01:30:25,629
Because we ruined it.
With fights.

2371
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:28,200
But we just wanted
everybody here to know...

2372
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:29,999
exactly how we
feel about you.

2373
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:31,515
Lights.

2374
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:35,840
You gotta get
bigger and bigger.

2375
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:37,554
Did you know
this was coming?

2376
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:52,991
You are so beautiful

2377
01:30:53,480 --> 01:30:55,914
So beautiful

2378
01:30:56,240 --> 01:30:57,240
Aww.

2379
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:00,269
To me

2380
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:01,475
Aww.

2381
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:04,278
Can't you see?

2382
01:31:04,360 --> 01:31:06,078
You're so beautiful

2383
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:08,033
This is real beautiful, man.

2384
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:12,598
You're everything I hoped for

2385
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,275
In a little sister!
Oh!

2386
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:19,069
You're everything I need

2387
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:22,237
Everything that I need

2388
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:24,719
They're kind of good.

2389
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:26,552
You are so beautiful

2390
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:28,468
As a couple. Right guys?

2391
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:30,354
Oh!

2392
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:31,595
To me

2393
01:31:33,080 --> 01:31:34,638
And to you.

2394
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:36,633
And to you. To all of us.

2395
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:38,239
You're beautiful, Jeanie!

2396
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:40,749
Oh!

2397
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:43,879
Dave, everybody.

2398
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:45,913
He's gonna draw!

2399
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:47,514
Love you!

2400
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:49,915
So sweet.

2401
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:51,856
Thought they were gonna
blow it. They did not.

2402
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:52,880
That's good.

2403
01:31:53,240 --> 01:31:55,913
This is how we do it

2404
01:31:57,880 --> 01:31:59,552
This is how we do it

2405
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:04,750
This is how we do it

2406
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:06,997
This is how we do it

2407
01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:08,599
It's Friday night

2408
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:09,736
Oh, you don't throw...

2409
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:10,988
And I feel all right

2410
01:32:11,720 --> 01:32:14,029
The party's here
on the west side

2411
01:32:14,120 --> 01:32:16,554
So I reach for my forty
and I turn it up

2412
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:18,870
Designated driver
got the keys to my truck

2413
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:20,096
Hit the shore
'cause I'm faded

2414
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:21,120
Faded

2415
01:32:21,200 --> 01:32:22,256
Honey on the streets saying

2416
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:23,349
Monty, yo, we made it

2417
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:25,670
I'm kinda buzzed
and it's all because

2418
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:27,591
This is how we do it

2419
01:32:27,680 --> 01:32:30,148
South Central does it
like nobody does

2420
01:32:30,440 --> 01:32:31,919
This is how we do it

2421
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:33,000
All right.

2422
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:34,640
To all my neighbors,
you got much flavor

2423
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:37,315
This is how we do it

2424
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:40,796
#StangleBenoit2016.

2425
01:32:41,640 --> 01:32:43,471
Hell yeah! Fo sho!

2426
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:45,788
Oh, God!

2427
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:47,275
Well...

2428
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:50,192
I picked a bad pose, guys.

2429
01:32:50,680 --> 01:32:51,715
Fireworks!

2430
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:54,392
These are for you, Jeanie!

2431
01:32:55,560 --> 01:32:57,471
Fireworks close the show!

2432
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:01,312
Those are from China,
those fireworks.

2433
01:33:16,080 --> 01:33:18,389
You idiots! You fucking...

2434
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:32,719
This is cool.

2435
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:34,358
I didn't know
you could do it this way.

2436
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:35,799
Oh...

2437
01:33:38,600 --> 01:33:39,635
I'm done.

2438
01:33:39,720 --> 01:33:41,392
Fuck. Holy shit.

2439
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:42,480
Okay.

2440
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:44,073
That was great.
Good job.

2441
01:33:54,280 --> 01:33:55,280
Whoo!

2442
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:00,118
I'm so behind right now
on Game of Thrones.

2443
01:34:00,200 --> 01:34:01,520
I don't even know
what's happening

2444
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:03,636
with Khaleesi and her
Dothraki boyfriend.

2445
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:06,553
Okay. Well he's dead,
and so is Jon Snow.

2446
01:34:06,640 --> 01:34:07,755
Jon Snow?

2447
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:09,717
Fuck that dude.
I'm taller than him anyways.

2448
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:11,319
Saw him.

2449
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:13,718
I just found out
some spelunker

2450
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:15,472
went dunkin' in
your bunker.

2451
01:34:17,080 --> 01:34:20,231
You are fresh as a fucking
dick in the morning.

2452
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:21,833
That's not
that fresh.

2453
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:24,275
Have you ever sucked a dick
in the morning?

2454
01:34:24,760 --> 01:34:26,955
I brush my teeth
with dick, girl.

2455
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:28,837
All right. Okay.
What?

2456
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:30,831
Oh. Fox don't
like that joke?

2457
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:35,155
I'm gonna throw up.
You look like meat!

2458
01:34:35,240 --> 01:34:36,753
Inner dialogue,
inner dialogue.

2459
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:38,393
I once got
lockjaw so bad

2460
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:40,120
that I was sucking a
homeless man's thumb.

2461
01:34:40,240 --> 01:34:41,816
Dave actually had to come
get me from the hospital...

2462
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:45,628
because they found 13 Pokémon
pogs and a slammer...

2463
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:47,073
shoved up
my butthole.

2464
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:49,589
I just had to wait
to poop them out.

2465
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:51,872
Pikachu.

2466
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:53,634
Pikachu.

2467
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:55,514
Charmander.

2468
01:34:55,880 --> 01:34:58,758
That's okay. No, no.
Keep your dick in.

2469
01:35:01,480 --> 01:35:03,789
For most of my life,
I thought goat cheese...

2470
01:35:03,880 --> 01:35:06,917
was a slang term for
cheese that's gone bad.

2471
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:08,558
I'd see moldy cheese
and I'd be, like,

2472
01:35:08,680 --> 01:35:10,238
"Dude, that
cheese is goat."

2473
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:12,117
Like, "Get that goat
cheese off the counter."

2474
01:35:12,360 --> 01:35:14,920
You look like a
deconstructed taco.

2475
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:16,035
Like carnival food.

2476
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:17,776
Like the waffle that the
chef would just go,

2477
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:19,119
"We're throwing
that away."

2478
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:20,952
What are we doing?

2479
01:35:43,640 --> 01:35:46,473
And the home

2480
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:51,112
Of the

2481
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:56,112
Brave

2482
01:35:58,640 --> 01:36:00,039
Play ball, Mike.

2483
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,116
You know we saw my nigga

2484
01:36:08,240 --> 01:36:10,674
Mike and me forever
It's the Stang life, bitch

2485
01:36:10,760 --> 01:36:13,354
Stang life, getting rich
Selling fucking liquor quick

2486
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:15,670
Mike and me forever
It's the Stang life, bitch

2487
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:16,800
Stang life

2488
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:18,757
I will never die
I'm a Stangle, bitch

2489
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:21,434
Brunch make me nut a D
on the B

2490
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:24,592
Flying fucking girls to my
sister's wedding at the beach

2491
01:36:24,680 --> 01:36:28,389
Now we have first-class seats
Couldn 't hold me back, G

2492
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:30,438
Jeanie's single, then, wow

2493
01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:33,239
Sipping Cristal
Sipping, sipping Cristal

2494
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:34,389
Sipping Cristal

2495
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:37,392
Jeanie Jeanie Beanie Weanie
Getting married with Eric

2496
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:39,351
Guaranteed he's got
a big, big weenie

2497
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:40,953
I'm proud of my little sis

2498
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:42,792
Proud that she got
a wedding ring

2499
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:44,950
And a necklace
Eric is my brother now

2500
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:46,314
So that means I'm kinda black

2501
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:48,197
Oh, wait, not really
I'm white, man

2502
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:50,016
I'm just happy to be
related to you, honestly

2503
01:36:50,040 --> 01:36:51,268
Shout out to Eric

2504
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:53,635
I be like Superman
Let me out the cage

2505
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:55,950
I got out of my cast
and I flipped the page

2506
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:58,640
And now I'm drawing comic
books like I used to do

2507
01:36:58,720 --> 01:36:59,720
Kinda cool

2508
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:02,149
Little sister Jeanie

2509
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:04,515
Mike and me forever
It's the Stang life, bitch

2510
01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:07,160
Stang life, getting rich
Selling fucking liquor quick

2511
01:37:07,240 --> 01:37:09,629
Mike and me forever
It's the Stang life, bitch

2512
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:10,760
Stang life

2513
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:12,472
I will never die
I'm a Stangle, bitch

2514
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:14,630
We'll put the wedding
back together

2515
01:37:14,720 --> 01:37:17,359
First we broke it up
But we made it better

2516
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:20,559
Nobody makes fun of me
in any way

2517
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:22,756
'Cause I got Mike by my side

2518
01:37:22,840 --> 01:37:24,592
Know what he said?
Scoliosis

2519
01:37:24,680 --> 01:37:26,159
Now I'm fucking your bitch

2520
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:28,834
Scoliosis
Now I'm fucking two chicks

2521
01:37:28,920 --> 01:37:31,309
Scoliosis
Vroom, vroom, vroom

2522
01:37:31,400 --> 01:37:33,516
Coming through the jungle
at you like, "Unh!"

2523
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:36,194
Mike and Dave Stangle
on the A TV

2524
01:37:36,280 --> 01:37:38,748
- "We're gonna die!"
- It's my girls and me

2525
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:41,195
My crew and us
We just cruising through

2526
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:43,999
And fucking back-flips
off jumps guaranteed

2527
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:46,548
Ran over my sister's face
It was kinda wack

2528
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:49,473
But you know what?
We came back from that

2529
01:37:49,560 --> 01:37:51,755
You're getting married now
And it's okay

2530
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:54,479
You're so Jurassic
You're so fantastic

2531
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:56,676
Mike and me forever
It's the Stang life, bitch

2532
01:37:56,760 --> 01:37:59,228
Stang life, getting rich

2533
01:37:59,320 --> 01:38:01,880
Mike and me forever
It's the Stang life, bitch

2534
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:03,029
Stang life

2535
01:38:03,120 --> 01:38:05,111
I will never die
I'm a Stangle, bitch

2536
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:07,236
My boy Dave
putting pen to paper

2537
01:38:08,440 --> 01:38:10,476
Trying to get
this damn label off

2538
01:38:11,120 --> 01:38:12,473
Like Aftermath

2539
01:38:13,160 --> 01:38:15,196
Vanilla Ice remodeled my house

2540
01:38:15,400 --> 01:38:17,789
Told Dave and I
we should start rapping

2541
01:38:17,880 --> 01:38:19,518
My brother's
the best white rapper

2542
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:20,874
Eminem!
