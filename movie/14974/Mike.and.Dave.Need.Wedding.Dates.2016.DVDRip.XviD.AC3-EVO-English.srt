1
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:30,103
Oh, no, oh, no

2
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:39,426
Ahhh, oh, no, ahhh, oh, no

3
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:42,596
Ahhh, oh, no

4
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:48,128
No, she don't mess around
No, she don't mess around

5
00:00:52,354 --> 00:00:54,766
100% blue agave.

6
00:00:55,324 --> 00:00:56,345
Taste it.

7
00:00:56,425 --> 00:00:58,029
Look, Mike, I like you.

8
00:00:58,193 --> 00:01:00,503
But no one's looking
for another brand of tequila.

9
00:01:00,663 --> 00:01:01,937
They've got the three... What is it?

10
00:01:02,097 --> 00:01:03,974
The Cuervo, the other one,
and the third one.

11
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:05,678
And they don't need more tequila.

12
00:01:05,834 --> 00:01:08,676
- If I can't sell it, it's not gonna sell.
- People want the new-new.

13
00:01:08,837 --> 00:01:10,214
- The "new-new"?
- The "new-new."

14
00:01:10,372 --> 00:01:11,493
They want that new-new.

15
00:01:11,573 --> 00:01:12,595
No!

16
00:01:12,675 --> 00:01:15,178
What if I could sell this tequila
to a customer?

17
00:01:15,344 --> 00:01:17,415
- Would I have your order then?
- Yeah, sure.

18
00:01:17,546 --> 00:01:19,253
And I'm just gonna pick a customer
at random.

19
00:01:20,582 --> 00:01:21,583
Excuse me, sir.

20
00:01:21,817 --> 00:01:23,820
Do you enjoy the taste of tequila?

21
00:01:24,821 --> 00:01:25,892
Why, yes, I do.

22
00:01:26,057 --> 00:01:29,266
But I only drink my particular brand,
and you will not convince me otherwise.

23
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,403
- It's a perfect candidate.
- Because it's your brother!

24
00:01:31,662 --> 00:01:32,766
I know that's your brother.

25
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,236
He dated my niece.

26
00:01:34,365 --> 00:01:35,400
Look, mate, I don't know your niece.

27
00:01:35,633 --> 00:01:37,408
- Okay.
- But if I did...

28
00:01:37,568 --> 00:01:40,378
I'd say she was a little clingy,
and she'd freak a lot of people out.

29
00:01:40,538 --> 00:01:42,313
We play Wards With Friends
together, right?

30
00:01:42,473 --> 00:01:45,477
- Dave, right?
- Name's Rick. Just got in from Melbourne.

31
00:01:45,643 --> 00:01:46,644
His name's Rick.

32
00:01:46,811 --> 00:01:48,017
I know he's your brother.

33
00:01:48,245 --> 00:01:50,555
Look, look, look.
You guys are funny, you're weird.

34
00:01:50,715 --> 00:01:52,058
We do this every couple weeks...

35
00:01:53,484 --> 00:01:54,705
All right, I'll take 10 cases.

36
00:01:54,785 --> 00:01:55,786
- Fuck, yes!
- Yes!

37
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,921
Yes! I knew it!

38
00:01:57,154 --> 00:01:59,310
- We sold your ass, Randy!
- I don't know if that's what happened.

39
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,698
- It was the hat, right?
- Was it the hat?

40
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:01,792
I just found this over there.

41
00:02:08,735 --> 00:02:09,873
Do something crazy

42
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:12,105
Live like it's Mardi Gras

43
00:02:12,205 --> 00:02:13,860
And go jump, make the party start

44
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,828
Don't need no R&R

45
00:02:15,908 --> 00:02:17,751
To regular life, I say Au revoir

46
00:02:17,844 --> 00:02:20,166
Yay! Living life in the fast lane

47
00:02:20,246 --> 00:02:21,782
Now your pain only be champagne

48
00:02:21,881 --> 00:02:25,419
So please come join me
One thing, good vibes only

49
00:02:25,885 --> 00:02:29,458
Start the keg, I'mma fill my cup

50
00:02:29,555 --> 00:02:32,934
Got fireworks, got booze
Let's blow some shit up

51
00:02:33,726 --> 00:02:35,467
Tonight I'm going stupid

52
00:02:35,561 --> 00:02:37,199
Doing things I've never done

53
00:02:37,697 --> 00:02:39,886
We all got one thing in common

54
00:02:39,966 --> 00:02:41,810
We just wanna have fun

55
00:02:44,906 --> 00:02:46,112
Do something crazy

56
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,209
Okay

57
00:02:48,943 --> 00:02:49,944
Do something crazy

58
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:53,882
Do what you wanna do

59
00:02:56,818 --> 00:02:57,819
Do something crazy

60
00:03:00,822 --> 00:03:01,823
I'm about to do

61
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:03,892
I'm about to do

62
00:03:04,926 --> 00:03:05,927
Do something crazy

63
00:03:06,594 --> 00:03:07,595
Do something crazy

64
00:03:07,796 --> 00:03:09,833
Do something wild

65
00:03:09,931 --> 00:03:11,467
Rolling with the homies

66
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,588
Chicks by my side

67
00:03:13,668 --> 00:03:15,807
Live for the moment

68
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,679
All of the time

69
00:03:17,772 --> 00:03:19,683
Turn up the music

70
00:03:19,774 --> 00:03:21,482
Only good vibes

71
00:03:21,944 --> 00:03:23,433
Sorry to throw the accent at you, bro.

72
00:03:23,513 --> 00:03:25,015
No, dude. I loved it,
and it kept me in the now.

73
00:03:25,348 --> 00:03:28,124
Do you realize that that sale puts us
at number three in the office?

74
00:03:28,285 --> 00:03:30,787
The Stangle bros are killing it right now!

75
00:03:31,021 --> 00:03:33,092
It's not an actual hat.
They just call it a jimmy hat.

76
00:03:33,256 --> 00:03:34,428
If you wear two, they break.

77
00:03:34,591 --> 00:03:36,696
- It's an urban legend...
- No, it's not.

78
00:03:37,794 --> 00:03:38,829
Mom, Dad?

79
00:03:39,663 --> 00:03:40,835
Jeanie. Eric.

80
00:03:40,997 --> 00:03:43,841
Don't freak out.
I don't want you to freak out.

81
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,070
Just come on in.

82
00:03:45,335 --> 00:03:47,190
Why don't we all just sit down?

83
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,271
We gotta talk to you.

84
00:03:49,406 --> 00:03:50,749
We wanna discuss
Jeanie and Eric's wedding.

85
00:03:51,007 --> 00:03:52,111
- Oh! Sweet.
- Okay.

86
00:03:52,275 --> 00:03:54,721
Are you guys thinking DJ or band?
First thought, band, right?

87
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:56,448
No. People want to hear the real songs.

88
00:03:56,613 --> 00:03:58,889
You don't want to hear a guy
singing Beyoncé.

89
00:03:58,982 --> 00:04:00,271
You just want to hear Beyoncé.

90
00:04:00,351 --> 00:04:01,339
Oh.

91
00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:03,609
Yeah, but we want to talk about...

92
00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:05,498
is you two.

93
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,370
Now, over the years...

94
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,573
a theme has emerged
at our family gatherings.

95
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,107
Everyone's having a good time...

96
00:04:13,398 --> 00:04:15,587
- That's right.
- Things are going smoothly.

97
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:16,789
Party time.

98
00:04:16,869 --> 00:04:18,924
And then you two show up...

99
00:04:19,004 --> 00:04:20,005
stag...

100
00:04:20,305 --> 00:04:21,340
and you hit on girls...

101
00:04:21,573 --> 00:04:22,643
you act like idiots...

102
00:04:22,808 --> 00:04:24,378
and you ruin it.

103
00:04:24,543 --> 00:04:25,544
Ruin it.

104
00:04:25,711 --> 00:04:27,952
- What? We are not party ruiners!
- Mm-mm.

105
00:04:28,247 --> 00:04:29,453
We're party creators!

106
00:04:29,748 --> 00:04:32,558
And besides, when have we ever
ruined a family event?

107
00:04:32,851 --> 00:04:34,006
Ah!

108
00:04:34,086 --> 00:04:35,224
We thought you might say that.

109
00:04:35,387 --> 00:04:36,441
Yep, here we go. And we just stream it.

110
00:04:36,521 --> 00:04:37,509
Apple TV.

111
00:04:37,589 --> 00:04:38,625
We just need your password.

112
00:04:38,858 --> 00:04:40,269
- Bryan's baby dick 69.
- Yeah.

113
00:04:40,426 --> 00:04:41,906
Bryan's baby dick 69.

114
00:04:42,229 --> 00:04:43,833
What the fuck, guys? Really?

115
00:04:43,998 --> 00:04:45,019
- Got it. Yep.
- Is that it?

116
00:04:45,099 --> 00:04:46,100
Good.

117
00:04:47,735 --> 00:04:49,681
Happy Fourth of July!

118
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,106
Oh, shit!

119
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,589
It was fun up to that point.

120
00:05:06,553 --> 00:05:08,624
God damn it! My trailer!

121
00:05:16,797 --> 00:05:18,254
Oh, shit.

122
00:05:18,334 --> 00:05:20,141
Actually, this is what
we're trying to avoid.

123
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,641
- The both of you are fucking idiots.
- Fucking losers!

124
00:05:32,815 --> 00:05:35,819
Grandpa, wake up! Take his tie.

125
00:05:35,985 --> 00:05:39,075
Are you saying we had something to do
with Grandfather's death? Hmm?

126
00:05:39,155 --> 00:05:41,226
He died five years after that!

127
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,301
That is a lot of guilt to put us.
Shame on you.

128
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:45,837
Plus, this video only shows the screw-ups.

129
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:48,268
Where's the epic tracking
shots of smiling faces?

130
00:05:48,965 --> 00:05:50,569
And everybody looking at us, just going...

131
00:05:50,733 --> 00:05:52,770
"God, I love Mike and Dave.

132
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:55,040
"They made this whole party worth it."

133
00:05:55,304 --> 00:05:57,785
When are the two of you going to grow up?

134
00:05:58,008 --> 00:06:00,114
This shtick was cute for a while...

135
00:06:00,278 --> 00:06:01,689
but it's gotten stale.

136
00:06:01,846 --> 00:06:03,757
Mom, come on, what are you...

137
00:06:04,482 --> 00:06:07,122
You're talking about us like
we're a couple of losers or something.

138
00:06:07,285 --> 00:06:10,357
What we don't want you to do is
go chasing girls and get out of control.

139
00:06:10,521 --> 00:06:13,264
- You understand?
- Wait, we can still talk to girls, right?

140
00:06:13,424 --> 00:06:16,334
- You can each talk to one girl.
- The girls that you bring to the wedding.

141
00:06:17,028 --> 00:06:20,007
- What do you mean?
- I want you to bring a date.

142
00:06:20,164 --> 00:06:24,656
- That's two dates.
- You want us to bring dates to a wedding?

143
00:06:24,736 --> 00:06:26,941
- Excuse me?
- Are you allowed to do that?

144
00:06:27,105 --> 00:06:29,777
Nice, respectable, smart girls!
Keep you in line.

145
00:06:29,941 --> 00:06:31,147
- What the fuck?
- What?

146
00:06:31,309 --> 00:06:32,652
- Are you insane?
- Oh, you're kidding.

147
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,051
You are not screwing up this wedding.
Do you hear me?

148
00:06:35,213 --> 00:06:37,956
Mom, do you hear this river of horse shit
coming out of Dad's mouth?

149
00:06:38,117 --> 00:06:41,156
We don't want you showing up stag
and riling each other up!

150
00:06:41,321 --> 00:06:43,733
- We don't rile each other up!
- We never get riled up!

151
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:46,029
- I don't get riled!
- He doesn't and I don't, either!

152
00:06:46,326 --> 00:06:47,896
Look at you right now! You're riled!

153
00:06:47,994 --> 00:06:50,201
- Take your head out of your ass, Dad!
- You sound insane right now.

154
00:06:50,296 --> 00:06:52,867
Everybody stop yelling! Okay?

155
00:06:53,033 --> 00:06:55,240
You guys bringing wedding dates
was my idea.

156
00:06:56,803 --> 00:06:59,374
Look, I love the shit out of you guys.

157
00:06:59,672 --> 00:07:02,551
But everyone is already stressed out
about this wedding...

158
00:07:02,842 --> 00:07:05,584
and I just need you to be cool.

159
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:07,480
Of course, Jeanie!

160
00:07:07,714 --> 00:07:08,988
Please?

161
00:07:09,149 --> 00:07:10,184
For me?

162
00:07:10,417 --> 00:07:12,761
I promise. We would never do anything
to mess up your wedding.

163
00:07:13,386 --> 00:07:14,592
Jeanie, we love you.

164
00:07:15,156 --> 00:07:16,410
We want this to be
the best day of your life.

165
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:17,479
Yeah.

166
00:07:17,559 --> 00:07:18,647
You, too, Eric.

167
00:07:18,727 --> 00:07:19,933
- Oh.
- Oh. Thank you.

168
00:07:20,228 --> 00:07:21,329
Mostly you, though, Jeanie.

169
00:07:22,364 --> 00:07:24,319
If you want us to bring dates,
we're bringing dates.

170
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:25,469
All right, it's settled then.

171
00:07:26,935 --> 00:07:28,312
Wedding dates!

172
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:31,207
Dave, buddy, let me talk to you
for a second, okay? Listen.

173
00:07:31,373 --> 00:07:33,444
I'm sorry to lump you in with Mike...

174
00:07:33,608 --> 00:07:35,281
but if I only told your older brother
to bring a date...

175
00:07:35,444 --> 00:07:37,048
he'd get all weird about it.

176
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:39,350
I just feel like he's holding you back.

177
00:07:39,514 --> 00:07:41,050
Dad, I don't mind
being lumped in with Mike.

178
00:07:41,283 --> 00:07:42,626
Do you remember
the fifth grade bake sale...

179
00:07:42,784 --> 00:07:43,819
when Mom made those cupcakes...

180
00:07:44,086 --> 00:07:45,258
and I called them moist?

181
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,730
- Mm-hmm.
- Everyone called me Moist...

182
00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:49,800
till Mike took a cupcake...

183
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:52,598
and shoved it in Tom Ginty's face.

184
00:07:52,761 --> 00:07:56,073
He said, "Now you're moist, Moist."

185
00:07:57,201 --> 00:07:59,306
That's the kind of guy Mike is.

186
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,106
So, think on that...

187
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:03,245
Dad.

188
00:08:05,542 --> 00:08:07,647
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to end that
on such a weird note, Dad.

189
00:08:07,744 --> 00:08:09,815
- I love you. And thanks.
- Good. I don't want you to be mad.

190
00:08:09,913 --> 00:08:11,035
I'm not even mad. I'm not even upset.

191
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:12,150
We're gonna find some dates.

192
00:08:13,283 --> 00:08:15,854
I gotta say, some nights,
I am not looking my best.

193
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,066
But tonight is not one of those nights!

194
00:08:19,256 --> 00:08:20,462
- Do you like my hair?
- Yeah, girl.

195
00:08:20,624 --> 00:08:22,126
- You look good.
- No.

196
00:08:22,292 --> 00:08:23,464
We're gonna make a lot of tips tonight.

197
00:08:23,727 --> 00:08:25,638
Good. We need it. We don't have any money.

198
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:27,601
Uh, you got money for this ride, don't you?

199
00:08:28,098 --> 00:08:29,620
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

200
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,588
- 'Cause you have money?
- I thought you had money.

201
00:08:31,668 --> 00:08:33,725
- I don't have any money.
- You know I don't have money.

202
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:36,343
Yeah, y'all are whispering like people
that don't got money.

203
00:08:36,509 --> 00:08:37,954
Check it out. I'mma pay you right now.

204
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:39,765
Boop. I Apple Paid.

205
00:08:39,845 --> 00:08:40,983
I don't even have Apple Pay.

206
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,021
Yo, Siri, pay this man.

207
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:44,303
He's already paid.

208
00:08:44,383 --> 00:08:45,371
God damn it!

209
00:08:45,451 --> 00:08:47,863
I'm not gonna take shit from you,
because this my cab.

210
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,442
You shouldn't take shit from us.

211
00:08:49,522 --> 00:08:51,744
- You should kick us out!
- You should kick us out of this cab.

212
00:08:51,824 --> 00:08:54,914
You know what? I'm gonna kick you
the fuck out of this cab.

213
00:08:54,994 --> 00:08:57,216
Yeah, just go three more blocks up
on the right...

214
00:08:57,296 --> 00:08:58,331
and then kick us out!

215
00:08:59,597 --> 00:09:01,834
Here we are! Get out of my cab.

216
00:09:02,001 --> 00:09:03,309
Thank you. You're a really good person.

217
00:09:03,469 --> 00:09:04,504
Okay, God bless you.

218
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,150
I'm just gonna start driving for Uber.
Fuck it.

219
00:09:07,606 --> 00:09:08,607
Ooh. I got a good idea.

220
00:09:08,774 --> 00:09:10,447
Let's pop off, get a couple of drinks
before work.

221
00:09:10,609 --> 00:09:12,681
Just a few,
because I don't want to get hammered.

222
00:09:12,846 --> 00:09:14,348
Yeah, of course not. Just a light buzz.

223
00:09:20,955 --> 00:09:24,026
Hey, hey, hey! Welcome to Sake Bombers...

224
00:09:24,192 --> 00:09:26,399
where your first Sake Bomb is on us!

225
00:09:26,561 --> 00:09:28,472
- Kaboom!
- You're drunk, Alice.

226
00:09:28,696 --> 00:09:30,318
You're doing that thing
where you're whispering,

227
00:09:30,398 --> 00:09:31,536
but you're really yelling.

228
00:09:31,699 --> 00:09:33,007
Because I'm upset with you.

229
00:09:33,167 --> 00:09:34,202
Oh, what the hell?

230
00:09:34,368 --> 00:09:36,691
I don't understand why you just
started yelling at me for no reason.

231
00:09:36,771 --> 00:09:39,578
- What the hell is going on here?
- Your little buddy is shit-faced.

232
00:09:40,741 --> 00:09:44,520
Straight up.
Her fiancé just left her at the altar.

233
00:09:44,812 --> 00:09:45,800
She's been going through a hard time.

234
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,969
- Are you guys talking about me?
- No, baby girl.

235
00:09:48,049 --> 00:09:49,528
You know how many times
I have come in here...

236
00:09:49,684 --> 00:09:53,633
and she is drunk off her fucking ass,
dancing on the tables?

237
00:09:53,755 --> 00:09:56,930
Only when Rihanna comes on,
because it's my jam.

238
00:09:57,093 --> 00:09:58,834
I am a strong independent woman.

239
00:09:59,095 --> 00:10:02,668
And I will get on a table
and shake my shit to RiRi.

240
00:10:02,832 --> 00:10:04,821
Because it's my right. America!

241
00:10:04,901 --> 00:10:05,902
Feminism!

242
00:10:06,069 --> 00:10:07,514
You just push your tits up
and say feminism?

243
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,047
Yeah. Read a Twitter.

244
00:10:09,472 --> 00:10:12,415
# 2016. Women can do shit now.

245
00:10:15,111 --> 00:10:16,556
Don't do that!

246
00:10:16,713 --> 00:10:18,215
Who put her jam on?

247
00:10:18,514 --> 00:10:20,551
Queen RiRi, forever!

248
00:10:20,717 --> 00:10:22,628
I'm really sorry that I got us fired.

249
00:10:22,885 --> 00:10:25,092
I'm just sort of surprised
it didn't happen sooner...

250
00:10:25,255 --> 00:10:26,700
- but I'm still really sorry.
- Hey!

251
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:30,103
Alice, you do not apologize
right now, okay?

252
00:10:30,193 --> 00:10:31,298
You didn't do one thing wrong.

253
00:10:31,528 --> 00:10:33,770
- Okay.
- People need to get in line with you.

254
00:10:33,932 --> 00:10:35,969
Right. You're right.

255
00:10:36,134 --> 00:10:37,875
Alice, why are you watching
your wedding video?

256
00:10:38,036 --> 00:10:40,525
And Alice... do you take Luke?

257
00:10:40,605 --> 00:10:41,626
I do.

258
00:10:41,706 --> 00:10:44,582
Because it's therapeutic.
The more I watch it, the less I feel.

259
00:10:44,709 --> 00:10:45,779
And do you, Luke, take Alice?

260
00:10:45,977 --> 00:10:46,978
I do...

261
00:10:47,412 --> 00:10:48,413
not.

262
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:52,155
Oh, man. Fuck you, Luke.

263
00:10:52,684 --> 00:10:53,958
Oh, fuck that guy.

264
00:10:54,219 --> 00:10:55,459
Fuck him right in his dick.

265
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,655
No!

266
00:10:56,821 --> 00:11:00,598
Because now I'm picturing his dick
getting fucked by another dick.

267
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:02,170
And it makes me want to protect it.

268
00:11:03,495 --> 00:11:05,975
Oh, my God, girl! Damn!

269
00:11:06,131 --> 00:11:07,804
You're better than this. Come on!

270
00:11:07,966 --> 00:11:09,445
We're T and A!

271
00:11:09,601 --> 00:11:12,105
Where's the Alice who made
vodka pot brownies with me...

272
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:13,649
for the junior high science fair?

273
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:16,946
Or gave us water balloon tits and we won
that wet T-shirt contest in Mexico?

274
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,249
Oh, yeah, they were so nice.

275
00:11:19,413 --> 00:11:21,086
I know, dude. We need that shit.

276
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:22,918
I'm tired of living like this.

277
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:25,487
We need an adventure.

278
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:29,999
We've got a great little package
we're selling here, man.

279
00:11:30,157 --> 00:11:32,433
A week in a tropical paradise...

280
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:35,539
with two fun-loving,
yet surprisingly well-read bros?

281
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:36,650
Yeah.

282
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,485
I read most of the Goosebumps series,
and so did you.

283
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:39,553
Yeah.

284
00:11:39,633 --> 00:11:40,621
Where do I sign up?

285
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:41,888
Dude, focus.

286
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:43,709
- Okay.
- This is for Jeanie.

287
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:47,474
So to find the perfect fun, but nice girls,
we're gonna have to meet a lot of them.

288
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:48,909
The Internet!

289
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:50,144
That's a good idea.

290
00:11:50,378 --> 00:11:51,858
Match.com, Tinder...

291
00:11:52,014 --> 00:11:53,569
Grindr, OkCupid.

292
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:54,650
Craigslist!

293
00:11:54,817 --> 00:11:55,871
Craigslist?

294
00:11:55,951 --> 00:11:58,056
Craigslist, you think,
that's where you go to meet nice girls?

295
00:11:58,153 --> 00:11:59,325
Dave?

296
00:11:59,488 --> 00:12:01,161
We met this couch on Craigslist.

297
00:12:02,024 --> 00:12:04,265
And you wuv this couch, don't you?

298
00:12:05,327 --> 00:12:07,466
I do love that couch.

299
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:09,900
I'm gonna unlock the swag on this bitch.

300
00:12:10,232 --> 00:12:11,220
All right.

301
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,940
Here you go. Just take a little sip.
Take a little nip-a-roo.

302
00:12:17,406 --> 00:12:18,407
Boom!

303
00:12:19,308 --> 00:12:20,596
Do you think anyone's even really gonna
see this?

304
00:12:20,676 --> 00:12:21,677
God, I hope so.

305
00:12:21,977 --> 00:12:23,149
Like max, what do you think?

306
00:12:23,312 --> 00:12:25,986
We're gonna get, like, five or six dates
out of this, or what?

307
00:12:26,148 --> 00:12:27,752
I'd be happy with that.

308
00:12:33,758 --> 00:12:34,779
Hey.

309
00:12:34,859 --> 00:12:37,305
Did you see this thing
that Shelly's sending around the office?

310
00:12:37,528 --> 00:12:39,599
It's a free trip to Hawaii!

311
00:12:39,764 --> 00:12:41,319
Look what someone posted to my Facebook.

312
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,709
- I gotta tweet this out.
- Those guys are cute.

313
00:12:43,868 --> 00:12:44,903
Ala-hat!

314
00:12:45,069 --> 00:12:48,108
- I got the one on the right.
- I like the one on the right.

315
00:12:48,272 --> 00:12:49,260
Oh, I got the one on the right.

316
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,581
I like the one on the right.

317
00:12:51,709 --> 00:12:53,798
- We gotta send this to everyone.
- Let's all apply!

318
00:12:53,878 --> 00:12:56,000
- I want to go to Hawaii.
- I just emailed them.

319
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,268
Let's just meet them, give 'em a chance.

320
00:12:57,348 --> 00:12:59,453
So, you guys want to go to a wedding?

321
00:13:01,085 --> 00:13:02,120
Uh, what are your names?

322
00:13:03,788 --> 00:13:04,789
Do you guys have names?

323
00:13:06,424 --> 00:13:09,304
Basically we were looking through
Craigslist for work.

324
00:13:09,962 --> 00:13:11,117
Oh, you're both...

325
00:13:11,197 --> 00:13:12,198
Prostitutes.

326
00:13:12,465 --> 00:13:13,986
Whatever. Take us to Hawaii!

327
00:13:14,066 --> 00:13:15,067
Hawaii!

328
00:13:18,204 --> 00:13:19,492
We can't take you.

329
00:13:19,572 --> 00:13:20,560
No way.

330
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,916
Did you guys say something about
an all-expenses-paid trip to Hawaii?

331
00:13:23,142 --> 00:13:24,280
It's just for girls.

332
00:13:24,644 --> 00:13:26,419
That's not a deal breaker.

333
00:13:26,646 --> 00:13:27,750
Hi, my name is Lauralie...

334
00:13:27,914 --> 00:13:29,202
and I'm kind of new to this.

335
00:13:29,282 --> 00:13:30,269
Yeah.

336
00:13:30,349 --> 00:13:31,487
You're new to...

337
00:13:31,784 --> 00:13:33,263
Online dating. Yeah.

338
00:13:33,419 --> 00:13:35,797
I'm not really looking
for a heteronormative relationship.

339
00:13:35,922 --> 00:13:38,493
- You look like a Nike swoosh.
- Goddamn right, I do.

340
00:13:38,658 --> 00:13:39,659
I work at a dog shelter.

341
00:13:39,926 --> 00:13:41,303
Our sister loves dogs.

342
00:13:41,461 --> 00:13:42,615
I wanna make sure
they get really good homes.

343
00:13:42,695 --> 00:13:43,696
What's a good home?

344
00:13:44,263 --> 00:13:45,503
The white homes.

345
00:13:45,665 --> 00:13:47,612
- The what homes?
- The white homes.

346
00:13:47,768 --> 00:13:48,975
Like white people.

347
00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:52,975
Check, please.

348
00:13:53,274 --> 00:13:56,345
This isn't lipstick.
This is a tattoo, you dumb fuck.

349
00:13:57,345 --> 00:14:00,189
Who are you laughing at? Who?

350
00:14:00,448 --> 00:14:01,620
All right, look, here's the deal.

351
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:04,123
I went through a divorce, like,
three weeks ago. I need a vacation.

352
00:14:04,419 --> 00:14:05,774
No.

353
00:14:05,854 --> 00:14:06,855
Okay, you guys sure
you don't want to fuck?

354
00:14:06,955 --> 00:14:07,956
- What?
- Nothing.

355
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:09,110
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

356
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:11,479
Sounded like you said,
"Do you wanna fuck?"

357
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,560
Do you wanna fuck?

358
00:14:12,694 --> 00:14:13,715
- What?
- What?

359
00:14:13,795 --> 00:14:15,103
- What?
- You guys...

360
00:14:15,263 --> 00:14:16,367
- Do you want me to fuck you?
- No.

361
00:14:16,531 --> 00:14:18,010
- No.
- I didn't say it, but...

362
00:14:18,099 --> 00:14:20,238
- I'll suck your dick right now. What?
- What?

363
00:14:26,842 --> 00:14:30,184
Welcome back.
I'm here with Mike and Dave Stangle...

364
00:14:30,347 --> 00:14:32,020
who posted an ad on Craigslist...

365
00:14:32,182 --> 00:14:33,923
looking for dates
for their sister's wedding...

366
00:14:34,184 --> 00:14:36,221
in Oahu, Hawaii.

367
00:14:36,386 --> 00:14:37,490
Well, the ad went viral.

368
00:14:37,654 --> 00:14:38,689
Mm-hmm.

369
00:14:38,855 --> 00:14:41,233
It racked up over 6,000 responses...

370
00:14:41,391 --> 00:14:43,613
from women who actually wanted to go.

371
00:14:43,693 --> 00:14:44,694
Yeah, well, who's counting?

372
00:14:44,861 --> 00:14:46,306
You know, I guess we all are.

373
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:47,565
Is this my close-up?

374
00:14:47,731 --> 00:14:49,233
You guys, come on. Craigslist?

375
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:51,811
Honestly, this is about
finding nice girls...

376
00:14:51,968 --> 00:14:54,312
to go with us to Hawaii
for our sister's wedding.

377
00:14:54,471 --> 00:14:55,643
And I just want to reiterate...

378
00:14:55,805 --> 00:14:58,285
we're footing the bill for this
because we're gentlemen.

379
00:14:58,542 --> 00:15:01,231
- Free trip to Hawaii?
- I'm awake!

380
00:15:01,311 --> 00:15:02,585
- Come on. Craigslist.
- What's up?

381
00:15:02,746 --> 00:15:04,157
That's where you go
to buy old patio furniture.

382
00:15:04,314 --> 00:15:05,555
You know what else you can find
on Craigslist?

383
00:15:05,716 --> 00:15:06,751
Mm-hmm.

384
00:15:07,185 --> 00:15:08,528
- Love.
- Mm-mm.

385
00:15:08,687 --> 00:15:10,860
That's right. I said it.

386
00:15:11,023 --> 00:15:12,696
- Love.
- That one seems sweet.

387
00:15:12,925 --> 00:15:14,996
He has a kind soul.

388
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,162
Yeah, and he's also super hot.

389
00:15:19,031 --> 00:15:20,874
Yeah, he's hot as fucking balls.

390
00:15:21,033 --> 00:15:23,445
But just to repeat,
we're looking for nice girls.

391
00:15:23,602 --> 00:15:26,879
Like, girls that our mom and our sister
would like.

392
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:30,384
Okay, look, dude, we are going to Hawaii.

393
00:15:30,609 --> 00:15:31,986
Let's go on vacation.

394
00:15:32,277 --> 00:15:34,052
But it's not a vacation. It's a wedding.

395
00:15:34,346 --> 00:15:36,622
Do you really think a wedding's
the best place for me?

396
00:15:36,782 --> 00:15:40,059
Since the last wedding I went to
was mine...

397
00:15:40,218 --> 00:15:41,707
and it didn't turn out very well.

398
00:15:41,787 --> 00:15:42,788
I hear you, but look...

399
00:15:43,021 --> 00:15:45,468
this shit is why this shit
is perfect, okay?

400
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,799
Because ever since Luke left,
you haven't been the same.

401
00:15:48,095 --> 00:15:50,541
You need to get over that,
once and for all.

402
00:15:50,698 --> 00:15:51,802
And this our shot, man.

403
00:15:52,099 --> 00:15:54,079
That dude,
he's gonna get your groove back.

404
00:15:54,301 --> 00:15:57,305
This right here is an opportunity
of a lifetime...

405
00:15:57,471 --> 00:15:59,644
and you know we are entrepreneurs.

406
00:15:59,807 --> 00:16:00,808
You know what?

407
00:16:00,975 --> 00:16:03,216
Let's make these guys take us to Hawaii!

408
00:16:03,377 --> 00:16:05,050
You're right! Let's do it!

409
00:16:05,212 --> 00:16:06,200
Let's just do it!

410
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,315
- Yes, bitch.
- Let's fucking do it!

411
00:16:08,315 --> 00:16:09,603
We'll be right back.

412
00:16:09,683 --> 00:16:12,897
We gonna go to Hawaii!
We gonna go to Hawaii!

413
00:16:14,622 --> 00:16:15,623
Whoa! Whoa!

414
00:16:15,756 --> 00:16:16,928
- Hold up!
- What?

415
00:16:18,325 --> 00:16:21,602
Those boys said they wanted nice girls.
We don't look like nice girls.

416
00:16:22,596 --> 00:16:24,508
Yeah, I guess
I haven't showered in a while.

417
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:26,643
Fine, well, you know what we're gonna do?

418
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:30,610
We're gonna look respectable as fuck.

419
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,112
Like nice girls.

420
00:16:34,176 --> 00:16:35,484
Ugh.

421
00:16:35,645 --> 00:16:37,716
Dude, it's like that Jesus rag!

422
00:16:38,781 --> 00:16:40,351
Ow! It's part of me.

423
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:43,130
Tatiana, your underwear
needs more underwears.

424
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:45,588
Whoa!

425
00:16:48,024 --> 00:16:49,970
Oh, this dress is my bitch!

426
00:16:52,628 --> 00:16:54,630
Dude, we have met 37 insane women.

427
00:16:55,865 --> 00:16:57,173
We can't bring any of these girls.

428
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,370
Maybe Dad'll just forget about
his ultimatum.

429
00:16:59,535 --> 00:17:02,482
Why would Dad forget about an old tomato?

430
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,679
No, his ultimatum.

431
00:17:04,842 --> 00:17:06,014
- Old tom...
- Ultimatum.

432
00:17:06,177 --> 00:17:07,212
Are you saying "old tomato"?

433
00:17:07,478 --> 00:17:10,101
Ultima-tomb. Like a tomb or a crypt.

434
00:17:10,181 --> 00:17:11,216
Ultimatum.

435
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:14,592
Well, we gotta figure something out,
because the wedding's coming up quick.

436
00:17:24,696 --> 00:17:26,232
Why is everything a competition with you?

437
00:17:26,464 --> 00:17:28,740
And I said that first, so actually,
I won that.

438
00:17:31,536 --> 00:17:32,742
So what time are we meeting them?

439
00:17:32,904 --> 00:17:34,679
Technically, no time.

440
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,211
Yeah, because I was thinking about
emailing them...

441
00:17:38,376 --> 00:17:39,980
but then I was thinking, um...

442
00:17:40,144 --> 00:17:43,024
what kind of floozy-ass bimbo
would respond to that ad?

443
00:17:43,382 --> 00:17:44,418
Um...

444
00:17:44,517 --> 00:17:45,518
Us.

445
00:17:45,685 --> 00:17:48,165
Yeah, but we're not like those idiots.
You know what I'm saying?

446
00:17:48,321 --> 00:17:51,131
Because they're all like,
"Oh! Pick me, pick me!"

447
00:17:51,424 --> 00:17:53,426
it's like the guys interviewing the girls.

448
00:17:53,593 --> 00:17:56,096
Like, it immediately would put us
in an inferior position.

449
00:17:56,262 --> 00:17:58,264
We're gonna flip the script
and Bachelorette that shit.

450
00:17:58,531 --> 00:18:00,704
- Those guys would be lucky to have us.
- Right.

451
00:18:00,867 --> 00:18:02,938
- We just gotta make them think so.
- Okay, right.

452
00:18:03,036 --> 00:18:05,209
But, you know,
I'm really not good at lying...

453
00:18:05,305 --> 00:18:07,627
because I always try to start small
and then it gets crazy...

454
00:18:07,707 --> 00:18:10,415
and I make-up stuff
that couldn't possibly be true.

455
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:13,333
Baby, you can do this.
Let's practice, okay?

456
00:18:13,413 --> 00:18:14,401
Okay.

457
00:18:14,481 --> 00:18:15,551
- Um, what do you like to do?
- Drink.

458
00:18:16,616 --> 00:18:17,856
Just sweet teas.

459
00:18:18,118 --> 00:18:20,098
Sweet teas and biscuits on blimps.

460
00:18:20,253 --> 00:18:22,393
All right, straight up,
you don't have to do an accent.

461
00:18:22,556 --> 00:18:23,592
I was doing an accent?

462
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:24,829
And definitely don't bring up blimps.

463
00:18:25,093 --> 00:18:26,401
Shit! They're leaving.

464
00:18:26,628 --> 00:18:27,868
If it was a competition, I won it.

465
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:30,201
All right, don't worry.

466
00:18:30,365 --> 00:18:31,366
It's all part of the plan.

467
00:18:31,533 --> 00:18:32,637
- Is it?
- Oh, yeah.

468
00:18:32,801 --> 00:18:35,281
What does that mean? What plan?
I don't know this part of the plan...

469
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:36,371
Whoa! Ahh!

470
00:18:36,872 --> 00:18:38,673
Oh, fuck!

471
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,563
Tatiana! Oh!

472
00:18:41,643 --> 00:18:42,644
Holy shit.

473
00:18:42,878 --> 00:18:43,879
Babe. Are you okay?

474
00:18:44,112 --> 00:18:45,955
I'm okay. Yell, "She can't breathe!"

475
00:18:46,114 --> 00:18:47,218
She can't breathe!

476
00:18:47,382 --> 00:18:48,770
She can't breathe! Somebody help her!

477
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:49,851
Somebody give her CPR!

478
00:18:50,118 --> 00:18:51,654
- She can't breathe!
- I know CPR!

479
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,265
- Great!
- I was a volunteer EMT!

480
00:18:53,488 --> 00:18:54,796
Hey, don't worry.
My brother's got this, okay?

481
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,526
I took a class. I know what I'm doing.

482
00:18:56,792 --> 00:18:57,793
- She has a weak heart!
- Ma'am?

483
00:18:58,059 --> 00:18:59,231
- Ma'am?
- She has a weak heart.

484
00:18:59,394 --> 00:19:01,534
I'm an EMT. I'm like a doctor, basically.

485
00:19:01,798 --> 00:19:04,439
I'm here to save your fucking life, okay?

486
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:06,842
- She's my only friend!
- That's her only friend, Mike!

487
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,192
We got a pulse! Okay.

488
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,493
Don't let her die!

489
00:19:09,573 --> 00:19:11,314
Don't you fucking let her die, Mike!

490
00:19:11,475 --> 00:19:13,512
Just shut the fuck up, Dave!
You, too, shut up!

491
00:19:13,811 --> 00:19:15,415
Both of you, shut up! Okay?

492
00:19:15,512 --> 00:19:16,513
I'm gonna save her life!

493
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:21,217
Plug the nose.

494
00:19:24,354 --> 00:19:25,355
Oh!

495
00:19:26,423 --> 00:19:27,902
Are you okay?

496
00:19:28,525 --> 00:19:30,365
I am now.

497
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:33,130
- I saved her life!
- She's okay!

498
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,776
- She's okay?
- I saved her life!

499
00:19:35,099 --> 00:19:37,501
Thank you! Thank you!

500
00:19:37,668 --> 00:19:40,013
- You're under arrest.
- She hit my car!

501
00:19:40,171 --> 00:19:41,427
No, you guys, I'm totally fine, really.

502
00:19:41,507 --> 00:19:42,645
It happens all the time.

503
00:19:42,808 --> 00:19:45,220
That was a vicious hit.
We should take you to the hospital.

504
00:19:45,377 --> 00:19:47,220
It's crazy.
It's almost like I owe you my life.

505
00:19:48,147 --> 00:19:49,956
- Almost.
- Yeah. Technically, yeah.

506
00:19:50,115 --> 00:19:52,186
- Let me help you with that ice.
- I do.

507
00:19:52,384 --> 00:19:53,405
Oh, no.

508
00:19:53,485 --> 00:19:55,192
Seems like it's going pretty well
with your guy.

509
00:19:55,354 --> 00:19:58,610
Dude, I'm fucking crushing it! So hard!

510
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:02,635
Check this out. The kids in my class
are gonna love this story.

511
00:20:02,795 --> 00:20:04,399
I'm a school teacher.

512
00:20:06,298 --> 00:20:08,642
You're a school teacher? Wow.

513
00:20:08,801 --> 00:20:11,543
Oop. I think they spelt "frittata"
wrong on the menu.

514
00:20:11,704 --> 00:20:13,411
I always notice words and spelling...

515
00:20:13,572 --> 00:20:15,245
because I'm a teacher...

516
00:20:16,008 --> 00:20:17,248
and that's what I do.

517
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:21,549
- That's...
- So, Alice, um, what do you do?

518
00:20:22,383 --> 00:20:23,521
Manage a hedge fund.

519
00:20:23,851 --> 00:20:24,989
You manage a hedge fund?

520
00:20:25,152 --> 00:20:27,257
I don't even know what a hedge fund is.

521
00:20:27,421 --> 00:20:29,924
Oh. So there's a regular fund,
and then there's a hedge fund.

522
00:20:30,091 --> 00:20:32,162
And our fund...

523
00:20:32,994 --> 00:20:34,064
Uh, we hedge it.

524
00:20:34,562 --> 00:20:35,563
We hedge it hard.

525
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:36,731
Oh, wow.

526
00:20:37,431 --> 00:20:39,035
I get in, in the morning, and I'm like...

527
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,010
"How's the hedging coming?
You been hedging? You hedged much?"

528
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:44,477
And it's like, too big to fail.

529
00:20:44,739 --> 00:20:46,616
Corporate greed, bailouts.

530
00:20:46,774 --> 00:20:48,879
In a New York minute,
everything can change.

531
00:20:49,176 --> 00:20:52,055
On the floor of the NASDAQ and the U.N.

532
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,418
And then, Fannie Mae.

533
00:20:54,081 --> 00:20:56,425
Bernie Mac and D.L. Hughley...

534
00:20:56,584 --> 00:20:57,757
- Alice, you want some water?
- Yeah.

535
00:20:58,053 --> 00:20:59,829
- That's so smart.
- That is.

536
00:21:00,123 --> 00:21:01,845
"But what I do have...

537
00:21:01,925 --> 00:21:04,113
"is a particular set of skills.

538
00:21:04,193 --> 00:21:06,764
"Skills I have acquired
over a very long career.

539
00:21:07,063 --> 00:21:09,907
"Skills that make me a nightmare
for people like you."

540
00:21:11,701 --> 00:21:12,771
Click. That's it.

541
00:21:13,036 --> 00:21:14,123
That was amazing.

542
00:21:14,203 --> 00:21:15,648
It was like Dave was not even here...

543
00:21:15,805 --> 00:21:17,716
and I was just standing in a bar
with Liam Neeson.

544
00:21:17,874 --> 00:21:19,319
Like, "Hello, Liam Neeson's over here."

545
00:21:19,609 --> 00:21:21,987
You're a professional comedian
or something?

546
00:21:22,145 --> 00:21:24,955
What? No. I sell liquor with my brother.

547
00:21:25,114 --> 00:21:26,115
- Oh.
- Yeah.

548
00:21:26,382 --> 00:21:28,089
- I do like to draw.
- Oh, yeah?

549
00:21:28,251 --> 00:21:29,730
Yeah, I have drawings here
I could show you.

550
00:21:30,553 --> 00:21:31,657
Oh, shit, not that. Sorry.

551
00:21:31,821 --> 00:21:33,960
Here. So, they're like The Avengers...

552
00:21:34,123 --> 00:21:35,830
but they're different types of alcohol.

553
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:39,165
So, you have Tequila,
and then he's got his pet worm right there.

554
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,239
And his name is Lil' Mez.

555
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:43,011
Because he'll "Mez" you up.

556
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:44,856
The next one right there, that's Gin.

557
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:47,092
When he flips his cap off,
dawg, he's just like...

558
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:50,119
"Yo, I'll pop you off. Guaranteed.
One knock."

559
00:21:50,408 --> 00:21:53,088
Done. Next, Whiskey.

560
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:55,950
Likes to make moonshine and kill bad guys.

561
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:57,969
Dude, this is objectively amazing.

562
00:21:58,049 --> 00:21:59,187
Thanks.

563
00:21:59,317 --> 00:22:01,627
What's the hardest thing
about being a teacher?

564
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:03,288
I don't know.

565
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:06,492
Oh, um...

566
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:09,547
The hardest thing about being a teacher...

567
00:22:09,627 --> 00:22:10,731
is teaching cursive.

568
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:12,303
That's awesome.

569
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:14,205
- What about you?
- Yeah?

570
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:16,142
- Are you seeing anyone?
- No.

571
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,625
My ex is gone. Long gone.

572
00:22:18,705 --> 00:22:19,706
What do you mean?

573
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,717
He died. Of cancer.

574
00:22:21,975 --> 00:22:23,010
Oh, my God.

575
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:24,177
And AIDS.

576
00:22:24,644 --> 00:22:25,645
He died twice?

577
00:22:25,979 --> 00:22:28,323
And then he died in a plane crash, so...

578
00:22:28,882 --> 00:22:30,793
Whoo! That's a lot to take in.

579
00:22:30,951 --> 00:22:32,897
I know!

580
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,455
Thank you.

581
00:22:34,621 --> 00:22:36,123
Thank you, brotha.

582
00:22:38,158 --> 00:22:39,466
Dude.

583
00:22:39,626 --> 00:22:42,402
We should take these girls
to the wedding. Right?

584
00:22:42,562 --> 00:22:44,303
Mine's a sexy school teacher...

585
00:22:44,464 --> 00:22:46,808
and yours... hedges funds.

586
00:22:46,967 --> 00:22:48,344
- Just keep doing sexy eyes.
- Okay.

587
00:22:48,502 --> 00:22:49,913
Keep doing sexy eyes.

588
00:22:50,704 --> 00:22:51,978
I like Alice.

589
00:22:52,139 --> 00:22:54,517
And she's smart, she's funny, she's weird.

590
00:22:54,808 --> 00:22:57,689
We invite these girls to the wedding,
suddenly we're not losers.

591
00:22:57,846 --> 00:22:59,348
We're winners!

592
00:23:01,817 --> 00:23:02,852
Here they come. They're coming.

593
00:23:03,085 --> 00:23:04,826
Hey, uh, this might sound crazy...

594
00:23:04,987 --> 00:23:07,558
but our little sister is getting married
in Hawaii...

595
00:23:07,856 --> 00:23:11,827
and we wanted to know
if you guys wanted to come with.

596
00:23:12,027 --> 00:23:13,563
- Um...
- Um...

597
00:23:13,662 --> 00:23:15,767
Can you just give us a second to...

598
00:23:16,331 --> 00:23:17,571
Of course.

599
00:23:17,733 --> 00:23:20,680
Okay, so just whisper
like we're talking it over...

600
00:23:20,836 --> 00:23:21,924
like we're not sure if we wanna go or not.

601
00:23:22,004 --> 00:23:23,005
Oh, like...

602
00:23:28,777 --> 00:23:29,847
What the fuck are you doing?

603
00:23:30,012 --> 00:23:31,533
I don't understand why we're arguing!

604
00:23:31,613 --> 00:23:32,785
I thought we wanted to go.

605
00:23:32,948 --> 00:23:35,189
All right, fuck it. Let's go to Hawaii!

606
00:23:35,385 --> 00:23:37,729
- Yes! Fuck yes!
- Hawaii!

607
00:23:40,424 --> 00:23:41,579
Yo, what you know about goin' out?

608
00:23:41,659 --> 00:23:43,881
Head west, red Lex
TV's all up in the headrest

609
00:23:43,961 --> 00:23:46,217
Try and live it up, ride true, a bigger truck

610
00:23:46,297 --> 00:23:48,800
Peeps all glittered up
Stick up can, they go what?

611
00:23:48,899 --> 00:23:50,755
Jig wit it 'cuz ship crisp, split it all

612
00:23:50,835 --> 00:23:53,008
Ho's ride, get your nut 'til I can't get it up

613
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:56,310
Bad, bad, bad, bad boy

614
00:23:56,407 --> 00:23:57,728
You make me feel so good

615
00:23:57,808 --> 00:23:58,809
Aloha, and welcome.

616
00:23:58,976 --> 00:23:59,977
- Hi.
- Aloha.

617
00:24:00,077 --> 00:24:01,198
For real?

618
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:02,814
Let me get you gentlemen checked in, yeah?

619
00:24:04,148 --> 00:24:06,992
Holy shit, this place is nice!

620
00:24:08,152 --> 00:24:10,257
It's gonna be more nice.

621
00:24:10,421 --> 00:24:12,662
Nice girls don't show off their ecstasy.

622
00:24:12,823 --> 00:24:14,132
One of these is a multivitamin.

623
00:24:14,292 --> 00:24:15,294
Is this shit free?

624
00:24:15,461 --> 00:24:18,169
I can smoke weed out of this,
I can smoke weed out of this...

625
00:24:18,364 --> 00:24:21,504
Look at that teacher,
grabbing her apple a day.

626
00:24:21,934 --> 00:24:24,778
Look at that personality from behind.

627
00:24:24,937 --> 00:24:26,883
It is, dare I say...

628
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,518
- well-rounded.
- Mmm-hmm.

629
00:24:28,608 --> 00:24:29,609
Look at Mike.

630
00:24:29,775 --> 00:24:31,948
He looks like a funhouse mirror version
of a better looking dude...

631
00:24:32,979 --> 00:24:34,253
but he is just that dude.

632
00:24:35,448 --> 00:24:37,585
Dave, it is so on this weekend.

633
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:40,028
I am not touching this guy
the whole weekend.

634
00:24:40,186 --> 00:24:42,475
He thinks just because he brought me here
I'm gonna sleep with him?

635
00:24:42,555 --> 00:24:43,556
Check it out.

636
00:24:43,656 --> 00:24:45,812
If this was Mike's dick, I'd be like...

637
00:24:45,892 --> 00:24:47,701
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo...

638
00:24:47,793 --> 00:24:49,295
I'd get close, but I'd never touch it.

639
00:24:50,029 --> 00:24:52,305
They have such beautiful flowers here.

640
00:24:52,466 --> 00:24:54,856
She's throwing out
serious vibes right now.

641
00:24:54,936 --> 00:24:56,091
I'm like, I'm hungry.

642
00:24:56,171 --> 00:24:57,377
I'm gonna butter them biscuits.

643
00:24:57,639 --> 00:24:59,312
I'm gonna baste them ham hocks.

644
00:24:59,474 --> 00:25:00,885
I'm gonna be like a sex chef.

645
00:25:01,142 --> 00:25:02,985
Mr. Grey will see you now.

646
00:25:03,344 --> 00:25:04,516
I'm gonna touch Dave.

647
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:06,056
Every time he says something sweet...

648
00:25:06,214 --> 00:25:09,252
I wanna get some rope and chain
in bulk from Home Depot...

649
00:25:09,417 --> 00:25:11,328
and just see where it takes us, you know?

650
00:25:11,486 --> 00:25:13,261
That is messed up.

651
00:25:13,821 --> 00:25:15,664
Ladies, your wedding itineraries.

652
00:25:15,823 --> 00:25:17,278
# DoingItForJeanie.

653
00:25:17,358 --> 00:25:19,235
Today, we have the meet
and greet by the pool.

654
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,349
And then after that,
we have a dolphin excursion.

655
00:25:21,429 --> 00:25:22,917
Friday is the rehearsal dinner.

656
00:25:22,997 --> 00:25:24,085
Mmm-hmm.

657
00:25:24,165 --> 00:25:26,687
That's where Dave and I are gonna be
doing our big speech.

658
00:25:26,767 --> 00:25:28,404
Will there be any downtime?

659
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:30,243
Yeah, 'cause I gotta keep
in touch with the office.

660
00:25:30,405 --> 00:25:32,595
I gotta call my stocks
about the state of my bonds.

661
00:25:32,675 --> 00:25:33,677
It happens a lot.

662
00:25:33,944 --> 00:25:36,390
Mm-kay, I think we are right up here.

663
00:25:37,113 --> 00:25:39,889
Great. So which one
is me and Alice's room?

664
00:25:41,384 --> 00:25:42,506
Uh...

665
00:25:42,586 --> 00:25:45,931
I don't know.
Are you and Alice gonna share a room?

666
00:25:46,089 --> 00:25:48,378
Or I was thinking that maybe you and I...

667
00:25:48,458 --> 00:25:50,199
would stay in the same room.

668
00:25:52,095 --> 00:25:55,201
That sounds interesting...

669
00:25:55,365 --> 00:25:57,367
but I don't think it would be a good idea.

670
00:25:58,702 --> 00:25:59,703
Why not?

671
00:26:02,272 --> 00:26:04,775
Because I don't trust myself around you.

672
00:26:05,442 --> 00:26:06,716
You can trust me.

673
00:26:06,876 --> 00:26:09,117
I do trust you.

674
00:26:09,913 --> 00:26:11,222
Let's trust each other.

675
00:26:11,382 --> 00:26:14,455
There's so much trust.

676
00:26:14,686 --> 00:26:16,996
Sorry. I didn't mean to do that.

677
00:26:17,089 --> 00:26:19,244
I respect you so much,
I can't wait to get you alone.

678
00:26:19,324 --> 00:26:21,580
Yeah, we're gonna cover
all the room charges and stuff...

679
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,148
for up to $50 per day.

680
00:26:23,228 --> 00:26:24,332
Oh, my God. You don't have to do that.

681
00:26:24,496 --> 00:26:26,601
I'm a very strict teacher.

682
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:30,575
You be Michelle Pfeiffer
from Dangerous Minds, and I'll be...

683
00:26:30,736 --> 00:26:32,010
I'll be Coolio.

684
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:34,116
- Coolio's not in that movie.
- Oh.

685
00:26:35,507 --> 00:26:38,317
He is in song and spirit.

686
00:26:38,543 --> 00:26:41,217
I'm gonna call
a parent-teacher conference...

687
00:26:41,313 --> 00:26:44,089
and tell them what a bad boy you are.

688
00:26:44,249 --> 00:26:45,523
Please don't tell my mommy.

689
00:26:45,784 --> 00:26:47,105
Please don't tell my daddy.

690
00:26:47,185 --> 00:26:49,174
I think Wi-Fi is included, too, so...

691
00:26:49,254 --> 00:26:50,461
- That's always nice. Yeah.
- Yeah.

692
00:26:50,723 --> 00:26:54,715
If I were to give you a grade,
I'd give you a D.

693
00:26:54,795 --> 00:26:56,001
A big, hard D.

694
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:57,538
Why? I deserve an A.

695
00:26:57,631 --> 00:26:59,133
- What are you talking about?
- Oh.

696
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,335
Nothing.

697
00:27:00,501 --> 00:27:01,844
In conclusion...

698
00:27:02,002 --> 00:27:04,380
I'm gonna stay in the room...

699
00:27:04,538 --> 00:27:05,608
with Alice.

700
00:27:06,707 --> 00:27:08,709
That one, with Alice.

701
00:27:08,876 --> 00:27:10,219
Cool, cool. No doubt.

702
00:27:12,713 --> 00:27:15,785
Somebody overcooked the soft pretzel.

703
00:27:17,017 --> 00:27:19,240
My dick is hard. That's what I'm saying.
Give me five minutes.

704
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,857
Oh, my God. Ew!

705
00:27:22,389 --> 00:27:24,062
Lift it, drop it, shake it

706
00:27:24,158 --> 00:27:26,798
It's going down for real

707
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,210
It's going down for real

708
00:27:34,737 --> 00:27:36,148
Grandma, I'd like you to meet Alice.

709
00:27:36,305 --> 00:27:38,995
She's super smart, great conversationalist,
and she works on Wall Street.

710
00:27:39,075 --> 00:27:41,987
- But I'm one of the good ones.
- I think she is.

711
00:27:44,714 --> 00:27:45,920
I am a teacher, yeah.

712
00:27:46,148 --> 00:27:48,856
And you know what?
The key to teaching children is repetition.

713
00:27:49,018 --> 00:27:50,929
You'd be surprised how stupid they are.

714
00:28:00,763 --> 00:28:01,764
Jeanie!

715
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:06,108
- Hey, you!
- Hi! Hi!

716
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:09,106
I'm so proud
to introduce our wedding dates...

717
00:28:09,272 --> 00:28:10,911
- Tatiana.
- And Alice.

718
00:28:12,243 --> 00:28:13,449
Hi!

719
00:28:14,412 --> 00:28:16,517
- Oh, the bride. The gorgeous bride.
- Ow! Hi.

720
00:28:16,714 --> 00:28:20,389
This weekend is all about you
being happy and not shattered.

721
00:28:20,518 --> 00:28:22,674
- Oh. Thank you.
- Yeah.

722
00:28:22,754 --> 00:28:24,927
Check out your arms.
You got some Michelle Obama arms.

723
00:28:25,723 --> 00:28:27,632
How'd you get those guns
on the plane, girl?

724
00:28:28,793 --> 00:28:31,968
Eric... you are two points hotter
just being next to this woman.

725
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:33,685
Try 10 points hotter.

726
00:28:33,765 --> 00:28:35,853
- Try a million.
- That's too many points.

727
00:28:35,933 --> 00:28:38,056
- Wow, and Jeanie, nice snag.
- Thank you.

728
00:28:38,136 --> 00:28:39,638
You guys look great together, really.

729
00:28:39,837 --> 00:28:43,214
I'm liking this. Huh? Maybe you two
will keep these two in check a little bit.

730
00:28:43,874 --> 00:28:46,617
I think we can.
I'll just keep him on a leash.

731
00:28:46,778 --> 00:28:48,534
Maybe don't hurt him.

732
00:28:48,614 --> 00:28:50,094
I like these girls.

733
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:51,320
They're so fun.

734
00:28:51,484 --> 00:28:53,589
Unlike my maid of honor.

735
00:28:53,787 --> 00:28:54,857
She's having a time.

736
00:28:54,988 --> 00:28:56,092
How is ol' Becky Grammerstein?

737
00:28:56,289 --> 00:28:57,290
She's coming.

738
00:28:57,424 --> 00:28:58,732
- Jeanie.
- Hey.

739
00:28:58,892 --> 00:29:00,269
I'm in crisis mode.

740
00:29:00,427 --> 00:29:02,065
I ordered Prosecco for the Mani-pedis...

741
00:29:02,228 --> 00:29:03,332
and all they have is champagne!

742
00:29:03,496 --> 00:29:04,497
Aren't they the same thing?

743
00:29:04,731 --> 00:29:07,143
- No. No, they're not. No.
- No?

744
00:29:07,767 --> 00:29:09,440
Hello, Michael.

745
00:29:09,602 --> 00:29:10,603
Hi, Dave.

746
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:14,574
Look, I'm trying to make your dreams
come true, okay?

747
00:29:14,774 --> 00:29:15,809
- Right.
- What?

748
00:29:15,942 --> 00:29:17,764
If this is bad news,
I'm gonna eat your ass.

749
00:29:17,844 --> 00:29:18,898
- Sorry.
- Okay.

750
00:29:18,978 --> 00:29:20,924
Purple. It better be purple.

751
00:29:21,347 --> 00:29:23,327
I should probably go see to that.

752
00:29:23,483 --> 00:29:24,484
- You'll come?
- Yeah.

753
00:29:24,651 --> 00:29:25,925
Thank you so much for being here.

754
00:29:26,085 --> 00:29:29,034
Guys, good job with these two.

755
00:29:29,191 --> 00:29:30,670
Mahala.

756
00:29:30,859 --> 00:29:32,099
Bye, Jeanie.

757
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,261
Jeanie likes the girls.

758
00:29:33,428 --> 00:29:34,634
Jeanie likes the girls

759
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:36,332
Talk about Jeanie Jeanie likes the girls

760
00:29:36,465 --> 00:29:38,253
Because it's a" about
Jeanie likes the girls

761
00:29:38,333 --> 00:29:40,438
- Oil, yeah, Jeanie likes the girls
- Come on!

762
00:29:40,535 --> 00:29:41,990
- It's a" about Jeanie
- Likes the girls

763
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:44,893
- it's all about Jeanie likes the girls!
- Mike. Where are the girls?

764
00:29:44,973 --> 00:29:46,179
- Oh, hello!
- I'm Alice.

765
00:29:46,408 --> 00:29:47,529
I just I wanna give you a hug.

766
00:29:47,609 --> 00:29:49,054
It's so nice to meet you.

767
00:29:49,211 --> 00:29:50,485
Fucking A. You distracted me, man.

768
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:52,681
This dress is lucky to be on you.
Those pins!

769
00:29:52,814 --> 00:29:53,884
- My Mike?
- Yes.

770
00:29:54,049 --> 00:29:55,221
- I can't... Wow.
- He did.

771
00:29:55,383 --> 00:29:57,056
That's fantastic.

772
00:29:57,285 --> 00:29:58,923
Mike, Tatiana was just telling me...

773
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,465
that you saved her life.

774
00:30:00,622 --> 00:30:01,896
I most certainly did, Father.

775
00:30:02,123 --> 00:30:04,846
You see how great it is
to have nice girls around?

776
00:30:04,926 --> 00:30:06,182
- I mean, these are nice girls.
- Aw!

777
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:07,401
Absolutely.

778
00:30:07,531 --> 00:30:08,652
They are. And we brought them, so...

779
00:30:08,732 --> 00:30:10,006
Excuse me.

780
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,188
Excuse me.

781
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:12,256
See you in a minute. Honey, come on.

782
00:30:12,336 --> 00:30:14,491
Can I get everybody's attention?
Could we gather around?

783
00:30:14,571 --> 00:30:15,948
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God!

784
00:30:16,073 --> 00:30:17,848
We're killing this shit! We're killing.

785
00:30:18,008 --> 00:30:19,163
Mom and Dad like the girls!

786
00:30:19,243 --> 00:30:20,330
Ow.

787
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:21,821
Mom and Dad like the girls

788
00:30:21,979 --> 00:30:26,485
Hi, I'm Keith.
I'm Eric's best man, his cousin...

789
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:28,652
and his best friend.

790
00:30:28,886 --> 00:30:31,331
Welcome to the meet and greet!

791
00:30:31,722 --> 00:30:33,030
Yeah!

792
00:30:33,257 --> 00:30:34,361
Put your hands together...

793
00:30:34,525 --> 00:30:37,648
for Eric and his lovely bride, Jeanie.

794
00:30:37,728 --> 00:30:39,401
Give it up!

795
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:40,702
Jeanie!

796
00:30:40,864 --> 00:30:44,334
Hey, everybody. A big thank you
to my new family, the Stangles.

797
00:30:44,535 --> 00:30:45,590
We love you, Eric!

798
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:46,692
Thank you.

799
00:30:46,772 --> 00:30:48,911
And to my own family, I must say...

800
00:30:49,909 --> 00:30:51,582
Portland, Oregon in the house!

801
00:30:53,045 --> 00:30:56,026
I'm really happy
to finally make you all my ohana...

802
00:30:56,181 --> 00:30:57,558
which means "family."

803
00:30:57,716 --> 00:30:59,753
And as the Hawaiians say...

804
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:01,125
Kale maluna!

805
00:31:01,287 --> 00:31:04,359
Which translates loosely
into "bottoms up."

806
00:31:04,523 --> 00:31:07,231
But more closely translated,
it actually means...

807
00:31:07,459 --> 00:31:09,849
"your butts to the sky"...

808
00:31:09,929 --> 00:31:11,533
which is inappropriate.

809
00:31:12,865 --> 00:31:14,401
This is gonna be magic.

810
00:31:15,034 --> 00:31:18,277
Thank you all again,
so much, for being here.

811
00:31:18,437 --> 00:31:22,112
We are so happy
to have you at our wedding.

812
00:31:22,641 --> 00:31:26,420
Wedding. Wedding. Wedding.

813
00:31:26,981 --> 00:31:28,619
- Put the mic on the stand.
- The stand.

814
00:31:29,951 --> 00:31:32,073
- Alice.
- Where are you going?

815
00:31:32,153 --> 00:31:33,140
Hi! What happened?

816
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:35,291
You sort of zoned out for a sec.
What's up? You okay?

817
00:31:35,456 --> 00:31:37,834
Yeah! We're at a wedding.
Wedding. Wedding.

818
00:31:38,225 --> 00:31:39,747
You just said "wedding" three times.

819
00:31:39,827 --> 00:31:40,915
I'm fine. Yeah!

820
00:31:40,995 --> 00:31:42,770
Let's just forget about the past,
and move on.

821
00:31:43,064 --> 00:31:44,668
To the bar!

822
00:31:44,765 --> 00:31:46,039
To the bar?

823
00:31:47,001 --> 00:31:48,002
Mmm. Mmm.

824
00:31:50,471 --> 00:31:51,916
Ooh. I don't think these are shots.

825
00:31:52,073 --> 00:31:53,643
I mean, we're drinking 'em
like they're shots...

826
00:31:53,741 --> 00:31:55,982
but I don't think they're
supposed to be drunk like that.

827
00:31:56,143 --> 00:31:58,089
Your face is funny.

828
00:32:14,931 --> 00:32:18,488
Oh. Hey, Mike. I was just talking
to my new friend, Tatiana.

829
00:32:18,568 --> 00:32:22,143
- Tatiana, this is my cousin, Mike.
- She knows who I am. She's my date.

830
00:32:22,338 --> 00:32:25,046
Why would someone this attractive
ever be with you?

831
00:32:25,341 --> 00:32:27,648
Are you gonna hit on my date all weekend,
like bisexual Fonzie?

832
00:32:27,777 --> 00:32:29,688
I don't think it's gonna take all weekend.
Am I right?

833
00:32:30,146 --> 00:32:31,386
So, you guys are cousins?

834
00:32:31,547 --> 00:32:33,288
She's been jealous of me
since I was a little kid.

835
00:32:33,483 --> 00:32:34,894
What could I possibly be jealous of?

836
00:32:35,018 --> 00:32:37,294
Your outfit looks like Jimmy Buffet's
dust ruffle.

837
00:32:37,553 --> 00:32:39,726
Do you guys always do this?

838
00:32:39,956 --> 00:32:41,663
Okay, this is actually
a very fashion-forward outfit.

839
00:32:41,824 --> 00:32:44,306
No, you look like the wallpaper
from a Long John Silver's bathroom.

840
00:32:44,496 --> 00:32:46,066
Cool. I'm gonna hit the buffet now...

841
00:32:46,231 --> 00:32:49,872
while you guys do
whatever it is you're doing.

842
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:52,958
Okay?

843
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:54,039
Good idea.

844
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:56,511
Look at that.

845
00:32:56,675 --> 00:32:58,697
Pink little ass just bouncing away,
saying...

846
00:32:58,777 --> 00:33:02,300
Terry, come get me, Terry, come get me

847
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,468
No, it's saying...

848
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:07,553
Mike, crawl up in this
Mike, crawl up in this

849
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:09,494
Whoa. What's up, double trouble?

850
00:33:09,688 --> 00:33:10,909
Terry. Cousin of the bride.

851
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,229
Get at me later,
we'll make a Terry sandwich.

852
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:13,869
Don't touch her. She has chlamydia.

853
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:15,163
- Everybody does.
- No.

854
00:33:15,593 --> 00:33:16,594
Not everyone does.

855
00:33:17,262 --> 00:33:19,684
Saw you and Dave are doing your
speech together at the rehearsal dinner.

856
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:20,752
Mmm-hmm.

857
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,371
I'm going to bring the house down
with my speech.

858
00:33:23,637 --> 00:33:25,378
And why do you think
you're such a hotshot?

859
00:33:25,505 --> 00:33:26,677
You know Chris Rock?

860
00:33:27,441 --> 00:33:29,443
He's my neighbor.
Practiced my speech on him.

861
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:32,049
And he gave me seven killer jokes.

862
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,724
Suck on that, cousin.

863
00:33:36,349 --> 00:33:37,371
Terry out.

864
00:33:37,451 --> 00:33:40,261
Chris Rock? Fuck! That sounds awesome.

865
00:33:52,265 --> 00:33:55,269
Oh, my God. You were right.
These cheeseburgers are amazing.

866
00:33:55,435 --> 00:33:56,573
I know.

867
00:33:56,737 --> 00:33:58,580
Being a good girl is hard.

868
00:33:58,739 --> 00:34:00,651
I know. It sucks.

869
00:34:01,642 --> 00:34:04,624
You were hitting that booze
too hard for a nice girl.

870
00:34:04,813 --> 00:34:06,190
You need to get Luke out of your head.

871
00:34:06,315 --> 00:34:08,090
- Yeah.
- You do.

872
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:10,662
And what better way to do that...

873
00:34:10,919 --> 00:34:13,593
than good old-fashioned dick flicks.

874
00:34:13,756 --> 00:34:15,895
- Yes.
- Oh, God.

875
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:21,334
Tatiana. Mike Stangle.

876
00:34:21,497 --> 00:34:23,499
From the meet and greet.
Well, from before that.

877
00:34:23,665 --> 00:34:25,144
One second.

878
00:34:25,234 --> 00:34:26,235
Fuck.

879
00:34:27,469 --> 00:34:29,642
Hey. It's you.

880
00:34:29,805 --> 00:34:30,909
It is me.

881
00:34:31,073 --> 00:34:36,421
I was hoping maybe I could come in
and we could watch a movie or...

882
00:34:37,646 --> 00:34:40,886
- Do whatever you wanna do.
- Why are you whispering?

883
00:34:41,017 --> 00:34:43,157
'Cause that's what we were doing before.

884
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,355
They've got Cockbusters.

885
00:34:44,588 --> 00:34:46,499
Is that supposed to be like Ghostbusters?

886
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:48,536
Why would you wanna get rid of the cocks?

887
00:34:48,759 --> 00:34:50,500
- What's that?
- She's talking in her sleep.

888
00:34:50,661 --> 00:34:53,505
She says the craziest stuff in her sleep.

889
00:34:53,597 --> 00:34:55,753
It looks like his dick is gonna pop.
It's so veiny and hard.

890
00:34:55,833 --> 00:34:56,834
- Tatiana!
- Something's hard?

891
00:34:57,001 --> 00:34:59,838
Julio. My student. I'm doing
a Skype class session with him...

892
00:35:00,004 --> 00:35:02,109
and he's having a really hard time
in the schoolyard.

893
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:03,728
If you don't get in here,
I'm gonna start masturbating!

894
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:05,310
Oh, phooey. I've gotta go.

895
00:35:05,476 --> 00:35:07,031
That sounds like you guys are,
watching porno, or...

896
00:35:07,111 --> 00:35:08,099
- No.
- Tatiana!

897
00:35:08,179 --> 00:35:09,180
Does it smell like weed in here?

898
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,157
- You guys smoking weed?
- No. It was a skunk.

899
00:35:11,315 --> 00:35:13,818
I've gotta go, because a bunch of kids
are waiting to hear...

900
00:35:13,984 --> 00:35:15,691
if they've failed second grade or not.

901
00:35:15,853 --> 00:35:18,891
Well, I am doing
some grading myself, and girl...

902
00:35:19,057 --> 00:35:21,514
you are getting an A plus.

903
00:35:21,594 --> 00:35:22,595
Thank you so much.

904
00:35:23,229 --> 00:35:24,230
Mmm.

905
00:35:56,095 --> 00:35:58,252
- And then win!
- Skills. Def skills.

906
00:35:58,332 --> 00:35:59,835
Cheers to Tatiana and Alice.

907
00:36:00,001 --> 00:36:01,739
We're so glad you're here.

908
00:36:02,503 --> 00:36:03,573
Yes. Cheers.

909
00:36:03,738 --> 00:36:05,843
You guys, Alice and I found
this really cool thing.

910
00:36:06,007 --> 00:36:07,714
Jurassic Park ATV Tours!

911
00:36:08,776 --> 00:36:10,949
You ride ATVs
where they shot Jurassic Park.

912
00:36:11,179 --> 00:36:15,355
Actually, we are about to go
swimming with the dolphins.

913
00:36:15,884 --> 00:36:17,693
It's on the itinerary, so...

914
00:36:17,919 --> 00:36:19,796
But, guys, Jurassic P!

915
00:36:19,888 --> 00:36:21,299
I love this movie!

916
00:36:21,456 --> 00:36:23,959
Oh, my gosh, on ATVs,
this would be so sick.

917
00:36:24,125 --> 00:36:25,365
"Welcome...

918
00:36:25,526 --> 00:36:28,268
"...to Jurassic Park."

919
00:36:28,363 --> 00:36:29,467
"That is a big pile of shit."

920
00:36:29,631 --> 00:36:32,139
"Oh, you're not so scary, little guy."

921
00:36:38,073 --> 00:36:39,382
What is going on here?

922
00:36:40,877 --> 00:36:42,065
Oh! Oh!

923
00:36:42,145 --> 00:36:45,285
I wish we could do that...

924
00:36:45,448 --> 00:36:47,291
but we have a date with the dolphins...

925
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:48,793
at the bottom of the ocean, so...

926
00:36:48,952 --> 00:36:51,398
Don't you think we should do
what Jeanie wants to do?

927
00:36:51,554 --> 00:36:53,090
I mean, it is her wedding after all.

928
00:36:53,256 --> 00:36:54,462
Right, Mike?

929
00:37:23,755 --> 00:37:25,701
I'm so happy we're here!

930
00:37:25,857 --> 00:37:28,303
This is where the dinos
ran in the prairie!

931
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,461
I know, girl!

932
00:37:29,628 --> 00:37:31,801
Check it out! I'm a brontosaurus!

933
00:37:31,964 --> 00:37:35,001
I'm a T-Rex. I'm coming to get you!

934
00:37:35,634 --> 00:37:38,012
Guys, butts on seats, okay?
No hot dogging!

935
00:37:43,709 --> 00:37:45,188
"They're flocking this way!"

936
00:37:46,578 --> 00:37:48,080
Here's a T-Rex!

937
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,155
"Life finds a way."

938
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,462
Jeanie! Eric!

939
00:38:01,562 --> 00:38:03,041
Hey!

940
00:38:03,163 --> 00:38:06,076
Hi! Sorry, I lost Eric.

941
00:38:06,233 --> 00:38:09,339
I wasn't lost.
Just driving at a reasonable pace.

942
00:38:09,603 --> 00:38:10,843
Stay there. We'll come to you.

943
00:38:11,338 --> 00:38:14,319
All right, we better go around.
This ledge looks super dangerous.

944
00:38:14,475 --> 00:38:16,682
Oh, yeah, Mike's right.
It does look dangerous.

945
00:38:17,244 --> 00:38:19,850
It's a good thing my middle name
is "dangerous!"

946
00:38:20,014 --> 00:38:21,001
Yeah, it is!

947
00:38:21,081 --> 00:38:22,992
- Whoo!
- Whoa!

948
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:28,867
- Oh, God!
- What?

949
00:38:31,492 --> 00:38:33,130
Oh, my God, she's Superman!

950
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,172
Oh, my God!

951
00:38:39,268 --> 00:38:40,542
A-Money!

952
00:38:46,075 --> 00:38:47,520
I still think we should go around.

953
00:38:47,643 --> 00:38:49,919
She just got some serious air, bro!

954
00:38:50,012 --> 00:38:52,788
You call that serious air?
Check this fucking shit out.

955
00:38:52,882 --> 00:38:54,020
Whoa!

956
00:38:54,116 --> 00:38:55,972
Suck my clit, fuckers!

957
00:38:56,052 --> 00:38:57,053
Whoa!

958
00:38:59,855 --> 00:39:00,843
Whoa!

959
00:39:00,923 --> 00:39:01,958
Oh, not again.

960
00:39:02,958 --> 00:39:03,946
Yeah, baby!

961
00:39:04,026 --> 00:39:06,199
Easy does it. Nothing fancy.

962
00:39:12,068 --> 00:39:14,208
- Oh, my God. Look at what she's doing!
- I see it!

963
00:39:14,404 --> 00:39:16,507
Sweet candied nuts.

964
00:39:21,546 --> 00:39:23,082
Who are these girls?

965
00:39:25,149 --> 00:39:26,150
Whoa!

966
00:39:26,317 --> 00:39:27,990
Um...

967
00:39:28,086 --> 00:39:30,657
Where did you guys learn to do that?

968
00:39:30,822 --> 00:39:32,577
- We lived in Baja.
- Oh.

969
00:39:32,657 --> 00:39:34,330
Tore up a lot of trail down there.

970
00:39:34,592 --> 00:39:35,832
Made a lot of friends.

971
00:39:36,494 --> 00:39:37,996
Made even more enemies.

972
00:39:38,162 --> 00:39:39,334
God, I miss Baja.

973
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,341
Your turn, Mike! Don't be a pussy!

974
00:39:45,069 --> 00:39:48,278
I'm not gonna do it.
Name calling doesn't work on me, so...

975
00:39:48,439 --> 00:39:51,181
Mike, it'll turn me on
if you take that jump.

976
00:39:51,342 --> 00:39:53,118
Turn me on if you don't.

977
00:39:53,278 --> 00:39:55,281
Still not going to, still.

978
00:39:55,448 --> 00:39:56,449
I'm not gonna do it.

979
00:39:56,616 --> 00:39:57,754
Like we would ever do that.

980
00:39:57,951 --> 00:39:59,672
No way.

981
00:39:59,752 --> 00:40:02,194
Come on! Do it.
He's not gonna do it. Do it!

982
00:40:02,355 --> 00:40:03,834
Do not do it.

983
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:05,628
No, definitely don't do that.

984
00:40:05,859 --> 00:40:07,736
It's a bad idea. It's a stupid, dumb idea.

985
00:40:07,827 --> 00:40:09,966
- And it's dangerous, and it's foolish.
- Yes, it is.

986
00:40:10,497 --> 00:40:11,703
I'm gonna do it!

987
00:40:13,366 --> 00:40:15,101
Mike!

988
00:40:16,436 --> 00:40:17,540
- Oh, shit!
- Oh.

989
00:40:18,037 --> 00:40:19,209
Oh!

990
00:40:19,339 --> 00:40:21,311
I'm never gonna die!

991
00:40:23,676 --> 00:40:25,398
- Oh, shit.
- He going fast.

992
00:40:25,478 --> 00:40:27,116
Oh, no. Keep it straight!

993
00:40:31,084 --> 00:40:32,119
Oh, he's shanking it.

994
00:40:35,323 --> 00:40:36,700
Whoo! Got it, got it!

995
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:43,205
Oh, no, God!

996
00:40:43,331 --> 00:40:44,366
Jeanie, move!

997
00:40:47,369 --> 00:40:48,712
No!

998
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:49,905
No!

999
00:40:50,172 --> 00:40:51,674
No!

1000
00:40:51,806 --> 00:40:53,080
No!

1001
00:41:14,531 --> 00:41:16,841
It's gonna be fine.

1002
00:41:17,301 --> 00:41:19,356
Your face is making me think
it's gonna be bad.

1003
00:41:19,436 --> 00:41:21,325
I'm sure it's not as bad as you think.

1004
00:41:21,405 --> 00:41:22,426
- You know?
- No. Yeah.

1005
00:41:22,506 --> 00:41:23,644
Just show us what we're working with,

1006
00:41:23,774 --> 00:41:24,795
and it'll be fine.

1007
00:41:24,875 --> 00:41:25,876
- Okay.
- Okay?

1008
00:41:26,443 --> 00:41:27,531
Is it okay?

1009
00:41:27,611 --> 00:41:29,147
- Oh, my God!
- Oh! God! Oh!

1010
00:41:29,479 --> 00:41:31,925
Wow! Don't you look good?

1011
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:35,593
- Your face!
- Shut up, Mike!

1012
00:41:35,719 --> 00:41:37,528
You shut up, Becky!
Have you seen her face?

1013
00:41:37,688 --> 00:41:39,531
Oh, God! What?

1014
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:41,966
It looks like you were making meth,
and the bathtub exploded.

1015
00:41:43,193 --> 00:41:44,536
You look like Burn Victim Barbie.

1016
00:41:44,928 --> 00:41:46,236
Hush it up!

1017
00:41:46,396 --> 00:41:47,551
And you're Black Ken.

1018
00:41:47,631 --> 00:41:49,577
- Stop!
- Okay.

1019
00:41:49,733 --> 00:41:51,789
It's like an exaggerated smoky eye.

1020
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:53,872
Dave, be honest. Is it bad?

1021
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,813
This side, there's a little...

1022
00:41:56,909 --> 00:41:59,031
- There's a little discoloration there.
- Little discoloration.

1023
00:41:59,111 --> 00:42:00,249
Which side is it?

1024
00:42:00,479 --> 00:42:01,634
You could do a dance the whole night

1025
00:42:01,714 --> 00:42:03,250
where you just hold a hand over your face.

1026
00:42:03,382 --> 00:42:04,383
- Oh, that's smart.
- Okay.

1027
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:05,551
It's like a new thing.

1028
00:42:05,718 --> 00:42:09,424
- Do the Jeanie, do the Jeanie
- Like this?

1029
00:42:09,655 --> 00:42:11,464
- Come on, everybody! Do the Jeanie.
- Do it.

1030
00:42:11,657 --> 00:42:13,034
- I'm doing the Jeanie.
- Do the Jeanie, y'all.

1031
00:42:13,125 --> 00:42:14,160
It's a one-two step.

1032
00:42:14,293 --> 00:42:16,102
All right, that's enough.

1033
00:42:16,362 --> 00:42:17,966
Enough dancing! You and you...

1034
00:42:18,097 --> 00:42:19,474
outside, now!

1035
00:42:19,632 --> 00:42:21,538
Honey, calm down.

1036
00:42:22,635 --> 00:42:24,137
- Honey, calm down.
- Sorry.

1037
00:42:24,303 --> 00:42:26,647
Do you understand they've deformed
our little girl...

1038
00:42:26,805 --> 00:42:28,944
the day before her goddamn wedding?

1039
00:42:29,208 --> 00:42:31,332
She looks like Seal, for Christ's sake!

1040
00:42:31,412 --> 00:42:33,234
Oh! Why, Dad?

1041
00:42:33,314 --> 00:42:34,315
Ow!

1042
00:42:35,416 --> 00:42:36,759
Do you think he's gonna spank us?

1043
00:42:36,917 --> 00:42:37,918
What?

1044
00:42:38,686 --> 00:42:39,687
Never mind.

1045
00:42:39,787 --> 00:42:41,742
I haven't seen him this pissed
in a long time.

1046
00:42:41,822 --> 00:42:42,857
OOP-

1047
00:42:42,957 --> 00:42:44,766
Yeah. It's the other door.

1048
00:42:45,693 --> 00:42:46,781
They meet in the middle.

1049
00:42:46,861 --> 00:42:48,465
- They meet in the middle.
- God damn it!

1050
00:42:50,665 --> 00:42:53,043
Dad, listen. I know what you're gonna say.

1051
00:42:53,167 --> 00:42:55,423
- You're right.
- We're gonna sue the ATV companies.

1052
00:42:55,503 --> 00:42:56,709
- Right?
- I see.

1053
00:42:56,837 --> 00:42:57,838
Not what I was gonna say.

1054
00:42:57,972 --> 00:42:59,212
Let's Erin Brockovich this bitch.

1055
00:42:59,373 --> 00:43:00,943
Mike, stop!

1056
00:43:01,108 --> 00:43:03,331
You've got to own this.
This is your fault.

1057
00:43:03,411 --> 00:43:04,412
It's not.

1058
00:43:04,945 --> 00:43:06,982
If anything, it's the girls' fault.

1059
00:43:07,248 --> 00:43:08,556
They're crazy.

1060
00:43:08,716 --> 00:43:11,107
The girls aren't the problem!

1061
00:43:11,187 --> 00:43:12,564
You are.

1062
00:43:12,722 --> 00:43:14,861
What the hell did you think
was gonna happen, huh?

1063
00:43:15,024 --> 00:43:16,731
What did you think was gonna happen?

1064
00:43:16,893 --> 00:43:17,894
We had a plan.

1065
00:43:18,061 --> 00:43:20,473
The plan was to swim with dolphins...

1066
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:22,337
and eat bananas afterwards.

1067
00:43:22,498 --> 00:43:24,239
See, Dad, I'm not gonna
point any fingers here...

1068
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,401
but indirectly...

1069
00:43:25,568 --> 00:43:28,242
we wouldn't have been on ATVs
if the girls hadn't forced us to.

1070
00:43:28,404 --> 00:43:30,850
And who made us bring dates
in the first place?

1071
00:43:32,008 --> 00:43:33,062
- Not pointing fingers.
- Yeah.

1072
00:43:33,142 --> 00:43:35,383
All right. I'm gonna take back
what I said to you earlier.

1073
00:43:35,545 --> 00:43:37,684
I am going to lump you in together.

1074
00:43:37,847 --> 00:43:40,657
All right, you are lumped!

1075
00:43:41,317 --> 00:43:43,228
The hell is wrong with you, huh?

1076
00:43:44,354 --> 00:43:45,731
What the hell is wrong with you?

1077
00:43:47,323 --> 00:43:48,701
Dad.

1078
00:43:51,329 --> 00:43:52,740
Fuck.

1079
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,337
Everyone get the fuck away from me.

1080
00:43:57,502 --> 00:43:59,914
Move! Adult Swim!

1081
00:44:00,071 --> 00:44:03,348
It's all fucked now.
It's all fucked, you know? Poor Jeanie.

1082
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,497
Jeanie's special weekend, and I ruin it.

1083
00:44:05,577 --> 00:44:09,150
Hey, hey, hey, Alice?
That was not your fault, okay?

1084
00:44:09,414 --> 00:44:12,237
That's two weddings that I've ruined.
It's just like, "Stupid Alice!"

1085
00:44:12,317 --> 00:44:14,695
Look, it's too bad that
Jeanie's face got shredded...

1086
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:16,574
but this is supposed to be our vacay.

1087
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,443
Remember? We're supposed
to be having fun...

1088
00:44:18,523 --> 00:44:19,644
and going on adventures.

1089
00:44:19,724 --> 00:44:20,828
Get in here with me.

1090
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:22,335
I'm gonna find her.
I'm gonna make it up to her.

1091
00:44:22,494 --> 00:44:24,997
No, no! You're not listening to me.
Don't leave me!

1092
00:44:34,574 --> 00:44:36,697
Thanks again for letting me
join your spa day, ladies.

1093
00:44:36,777 --> 00:44:40,520
It's not like you asked or anything,
but you're here. Yay.

1094
00:44:40,947 --> 00:44:43,052
What did you guys do
for your bachelorette party?

1095
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:45,205
Did it get crazy?
Did you guys do that thing...

1096
00:44:45,285 --> 00:44:48,095
where you go to Vegas
and you dress up as a prostitute...

1097
00:44:48,422 --> 00:44:50,110
and you go out and there's a contest...

1098
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:52,397
to see who can get the most money
from a john...

1099
00:44:52,659 --> 00:44:54,481
but then you tell him,
"I'm an undercover cop"...

1100
00:44:54,561 --> 00:44:57,599
and they, like, beg that you don't tell
their children and their wives...

1101
00:44:57,764 --> 00:45:00,404
and they piss themselves,
and you've got the whole thing on video.

1102
00:45:00,567 --> 00:45:03,639
And then you put it on YouTube
and then there's the Auto-Tune remix.

1103
00:45:03,804 --> 00:45:04,805
Did you do that thing?

1104
00:45:05,472 --> 00:45:06,543
- No.
- No.

1105
00:45:06,874 --> 00:45:11,381
I didn't actually end up having one, so...

1106
00:45:11,547 --> 00:45:13,185
Why? Every bride
needs a bachelorette party.

1107
00:45:13,382 --> 00:45:15,537
I'm sorry Cabo didn't work out, Jeanie.

1108
00:45:15,617 --> 00:45:17,106
I know. It's fine.

1109
00:45:17,186 --> 00:45:18,240
You know I couldn't get the time off work.

1110
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,709
And it would have ruined it for you,
down there without me.

1111
00:45:20,789 --> 00:45:21,944
Is there some tension about this?

1112
00:45:22,024 --> 00:45:24,646
So I just thought, "Let's cancel
the whole trip," if that makes sense.

1113
00:45:24,726 --> 00:45:26,682
Jeanie, can you keep it down?
On the phone with Tokyo.

1114
00:45:26,762 --> 00:45:27,850
Did I bring up something uncomfortable?

1115
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:30,274
Also, I caught the shingles
because it was so stressful.

1116
00:45:32,234 --> 00:45:33,288
'Cause it feels like I did.

1117
00:45:33,368 --> 00:45:35,904
Plus they have Mexican bed bugs.

1118
00:45:37,406 --> 00:45:39,750
I need you guys to stop it!

1119
00:45:40,809 --> 00:45:43,119
Oh, that fucking gaping mouth of yours,
shut it!

1120
00:45:43,679 --> 00:45:44,680
Shut it!

1121
00:45:45,113 --> 00:45:48,858
I just want to relax!
Is that too much to ask?

1122
00:45:49,253 --> 00:45:51,859
Please! I just wanna relax.

1123
00:45:54,525 --> 00:45:55,799
How are you feeling, Jeanie?

1124
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,439
A little stressed out.

1125
00:45:57,595 --> 00:46:00,439
- I'll give you a minute to disrobe.
- Yeah, okay.

1126
00:46:00,598 --> 00:46:02,669
Face down on the table.

1127
00:46:03,067 --> 00:46:06,524
Hi, um, that is my best friend in there...

1128
00:46:06,604 --> 00:46:08,777
and she's getting married tomorrow,
and she's a little uptight.

1129
00:46:09,073 --> 00:46:14,216
And I was wondering if you could, um,
help her let loose a little bit?

1130
00:46:14,378 --> 00:46:15,399
You know?

1131
00:46:15,479 --> 00:46:20,485
Give her the "Hawaii Five Oh" experience?

1132
00:46:20,851 --> 00:46:23,474
The wink-wink, nudge-nudge massage,
you know?

1133
00:46:23,554 --> 00:46:27,060
I can't really wink,
but a wink-wink, nudge-nudge?

1134
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,081
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1135
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:30,834
Looks like you had a bit of a fit.

1136
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:33,601
No, no. That's wink... That's wink-wink...

1137
00:46:34,867 --> 00:46:37,074
I feel like I've gotten
what you're trying to say.

1138
00:46:37,303 --> 00:46:39,525
- Great.
- But I figured it out.

1139
00:46:39,605 --> 00:46:42,195
- You didn't really communicate it to me.
- Okay, that's fair.

1140
00:46:42,275 --> 00:46:46,121
Yes, you want the special
"I am blissful" massage?

1141
00:46:46,245 --> 00:46:48,350
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1142
00:46:48,848 --> 00:46:49,883
Um...

1143
00:46:49,982 --> 00:46:51,893
- How blissful is that?
- Oh, don't worry.

1144
00:46:52,051 --> 00:46:53,587
Physically, no penetration.

1145
00:46:53,686 --> 00:46:54,674
Classy.

1146
00:46:54,754 --> 00:46:57,758
Spiritually, I'll be doing
an intimate tour of her chi.

1147
00:46:58,057 --> 00:47:00,094
Oh, you're gonna be good in there.
I can tell.

1148
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:02,364
How's the temperature in here, Jeanie?

1149
00:47:03,162 --> 00:47:05,041
Oh, it's good. Good. Comfy.

1150
00:47:05,199 --> 00:47:08,544
Good. Take down the light a little bit.

1151
00:47:08,703 --> 00:47:10,410
So you're getting married, huh?

1152
00:47:10,672 --> 00:47:12,208
I am. Yeah.

1153
00:47:12,407 --> 00:47:15,263
I know it can be a stressful time.

1154
00:47:15,343 --> 00:47:19,257
You know it's like, "Who is this for,
me or my family?"

1155
00:47:19,414 --> 00:47:21,860
Yeah. I've recently had
an injury to my face...

1156
00:47:22,016 --> 00:47:24,018
which I'm a little stressed out about.

1157
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:25,720
Are you okay with oil?

1158
00:47:25,887 --> 00:47:27,195
Yeah, sure.

1159
00:47:30,191 --> 00:47:31,446
You know, in my country...

1160
00:47:31,526 --> 00:47:34,803
they call oil "God's beautiful lubricant."

1161
00:47:35,797 --> 00:47:37,970
It sounds better in my language.

1162
00:47:41,536 --> 00:47:43,125
Oh, that's lovely.

1163
00:47:43,205 --> 00:47:44,227
'kay.

1164
00:47:44,307 --> 00:47:45,695
Some ground rules.

1165
00:47:45,775 --> 00:47:48,365
One, no emotions.

1166
00:47:48,445 --> 00:47:50,550
- Okay.
- Two, breathe.

1167
00:47:52,115 --> 00:47:56,255
Three, there is no penetration,
only vibration.

1168
00:47:57,554 --> 00:47:59,932
What is happening?

1169
00:48:00,290 --> 00:48:02,531
I call this "The Bent Penguin."

1170
00:48:02,692 --> 00:48:05,172
This one is just "The Ham and Eggs."

1171
00:48:05,328 --> 00:48:08,241
This one is called "When Moons Collide."

1172
00:48:08,398 --> 00:48:10,901
"Angry Hummingbird." "Angry Hummingbird."

1173
00:48:11,067 --> 00:48:13,445
This one is called "House by the Airport."

1174
00:48:13,603 --> 00:48:15,844
Just checking in. Everything good?

1175
00:48:16,006 --> 00:48:18,680
Hope you're enjoying this.
For me, it's just another Friday.

1176
00:48:26,484 --> 00:48:28,327
"Happy Doll."

1177
00:48:28,687 --> 00:48:32,794
This one is just called
"Taking a Break." I am pooped.

1178
00:48:32,958 --> 00:48:35,700
A little break. That's nice.

1179
00:48:37,596 --> 00:48:38,734
Here we go again.

1180
00:48:40,632 --> 00:48:42,168
Are you even touching me?

1181
00:48:42,367 --> 00:48:44,847
No, but my aura is.

1182
00:48:45,137 --> 00:48:47,659
Yes, it is!

1183
00:48:47,739 --> 00:48:50,151
Sweet baby Jesus!

1184
00:49:09,263 --> 00:49:10,401
How's it going?

1185
00:49:10,931 --> 00:49:13,411
Shit, I thought I was alone in here.

1186
00:49:13,567 --> 00:49:16,514
Oh, yeah. You're not. I mean, we're alone.

1187
00:49:17,104 --> 00:49:19,448
How's Mike? Still really jealous of me?

1188
00:49:20,074 --> 00:49:23,851
It's like, yeah, okay,
do I own a Tesla? Yes.

1189
00:49:24,011 --> 00:49:26,651
Do I make a shit-ton of money,
like, way more than Mike?

1190
00:49:26,814 --> 00:49:28,122
Yes. But it's like, who cares?

1191
00:49:28,282 --> 00:49:30,353
Do I get backstage tickets to Rihanna?

1192
00:49:30,617 --> 00:49:33,173
Do I have a glass blowing
studio in my basement?

1193
00:49:33,253 --> 00:49:35,255
Hold up, backstage tickets to Rihanna?

1194
00:49:35,422 --> 00:49:37,333
Yeah, she likes to have me around.
You know.

1195
00:49:37,491 --> 00:49:40,415
- RiRi is Alice's jam.
- Oh, RiRi, is it?

1196
00:49:40,495 --> 00:49:41,530
- Yes.
- That's funny.

1197
00:49:41,697 --> 00:49:44,177
She would freak out if I got her
backstage tickets to Rihanna.

1198
00:49:44,333 --> 00:49:47,473
Well, you could get her tickets.
From me. I'm right here.

1199
00:49:47,636 --> 00:49:49,013
Are you serious?

1200
00:49:49,171 --> 00:49:52,482
Oh, God, steam rooms just open up
your pores, you know?

1201
00:49:53,142 --> 00:49:55,179
They open up everything.

1202
00:49:58,314 --> 00:50:02,538
Backstage at RiRi is very fun.
Sometimes she plays the DJ.

1203
00:50:02,618 --> 00:50:06,292
You know, just scratching records.
You know like...

1204
00:50:09,725 --> 00:50:11,398
Shit, man. That's...

1205
00:50:11,827 --> 00:50:14,884
Are you saying you want me
to get in there for the tickets?

1206
00:50:14,964 --> 00:50:17,706
No. No, no, no. No.

1207
00:50:18,534 --> 00:50:20,208
Yes.

1208
00:50:23,875 --> 00:50:25,218
Tatiana?

1209
00:50:26,144 --> 00:50:27,384
Tatiana? Whoa.

1210
00:50:28,212 --> 00:50:31,250
Sorry about that.
Looking for my wedding date.

1211
00:50:31,816 --> 00:50:32,817
Tatiana?

1212
00:50:32,917 --> 00:50:34,055
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

1213
00:50:38,222 --> 00:50:39,257
Please leave, sir.

1214
00:50:39,423 --> 00:50:40,663
What are you doing to my sister?

1215
00:50:40,825 --> 00:50:43,362
- Mike, I'm coming.
- No!

1216
00:50:53,871 --> 00:50:55,077
Get out!

1217
00:50:59,111 --> 00:51:02,525
Oh, sure. Oh, sure. Oh, sure.

1218
00:51:02,682 --> 00:51:04,525
So, are we, like, close, or...

1219
00:51:05,185 --> 00:51:08,156
Let's put the washing machine
on spin cycle. There we go.

1220
00:51:08,455 --> 00:51:10,363
What the... Tatiana!

1221
00:51:10,523 --> 00:51:11,729
Terry!

1222
00:51:11,891 --> 00:51:13,234
Terry!

1223
00:51:13,393 --> 00:51:15,634
- Tatiana!
- Shut the fuck up, Mike.

1224
00:51:18,198 --> 00:51:19,185
Whoa!

1225
00:51:19,265 --> 00:51:21,071
I'm gonna kick your ass.

1226
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:24,981
He is losing this fight!

1227
00:51:27,307 --> 00:51:29,162
Oh, God! I can see your nipple!

1228
00:51:29,242 --> 00:51:30,243
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1229
00:51:33,313 --> 00:51:35,317
Get your butt out of my face!

1230
00:51:39,487 --> 00:51:42,730
Well, thank you so much.

1231
00:51:43,258 --> 00:51:44,794
Um, I definitely needed this.

1232
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,770
I know.
Bring this gift into your marriage.

1233
00:51:48,330 --> 00:51:52,005
- All you need is load-bearing ribbons.
- Okay.

1234
00:51:52,167 --> 00:51:54,656
- And a reinforced ceiling.
- Oh.

1235
00:51:54,736 --> 00:51:56,010
I should warn you...

1236
00:51:56,137 --> 00:52:00,210
you may experience some
aftershock orgasms.

1237
00:52:00,442 --> 00:52:01,648
Oh.

1238
00:52:01,810 --> 00:52:04,984
So, I wouldn't operate any heavy machinery
for a couple weeks.

1239
00:52:05,146 --> 00:52:07,752
That is not a euphemism for penis.
I mean like...

1240
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:12,365
- tractors, cranes, big boats.
- Okay.

1241
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,193
Good to know.

1242
00:52:14,356 --> 00:52:16,700
- Oh, and please hydrate.
- Okay.

1243
00:52:16,858 --> 00:52:20,933
I cannot stress this enough.
The consequences could be...

1244
00:52:22,199 --> 00:52:23,644
You could develop cancer.

1245
00:52:25,168 --> 00:52:26,476
You have a very good friend.

1246
00:52:31,842 --> 00:52:34,322
Wait, you did that?

1247
00:52:34,678 --> 00:52:37,568
Yeah, well, I felt so bad
about your fucked up face...

1248
00:52:37,648 --> 00:52:39,059
and I wanted to make it up to you.

1249
00:52:39,683 --> 00:52:41,026
Aw! Thank you.

1250
00:52:41,351 --> 00:52:44,195
Hey, who needs a bachelorette party
when they have you around?

1251
00:52:45,555 --> 00:52:47,444
- He rubbed my butt.
- Yeah?

1252
00:52:47,524 --> 00:52:49,299
But with his butt.

1253
00:52:49,459 --> 00:52:52,065
It was like... He was on ribbons.

1254
00:52:53,363 --> 00:52:54,952
I don't know what you did
with Jeanie in the spa...

1255
00:52:55,032 --> 00:52:56,621
but she's in a great mood.

1256
00:52:56,701 --> 00:52:59,205
Yeah, no problem.
She just needed a release.

1257
00:52:59,371 --> 00:53:01,715
Oh, um, I had an idea for your graphic novel.

1258
00:53:01,874 --> 00:53:04,129
I thought you could do
like a Rum character,

1259
00:53:04,209 --> 00:53:05,711
who's like Rastafarian, and he's like...

1260
00:53:06,111 --> 00:53:10,281
"I'm Rum Rum, get in my tum-tum,
and I play the steel drum."

1261
00:53:10,816 --> 00:53:12,352
"You can rum, but you cannot hide, man."

1262
00:53:12,518 --> 00:53:15,021
Yeah, that's awesome.
Already, that's so amazing.

1263
00:53:15,187 --> 00:53:17,497
No, that's such a good idea.
How did I not figure that?

1264
00:53:19,525 --> 00:53:23,564
I think when I get back,
I'm gonna stop selling liquor with Mike...

1265
00:53:23,729 --> 00:53:25,208
and start drawing full time.

1266
00:53:25,364 --> 00:53:26,843
- Really?
- Yeah.

1267
00:53:26,999 --> 00:53:28,501
That's amazing.

1268
00:53:28,667 --> 00:53:30,874
Do you know how few people
know what they really wanna do?

1269
00:53:31,036 --> 00:53:33,192
But then I think about
what Mike's gonna think about it all...

1270
00:53:33,272 --> 00:53:35,252
and he's gonna hate that idea.

1271
00:53:35,408 --> 00:53:37,116
He's so clingy.

1272
00:53:37,278 --> 00:53:40,101
When we were kids,
if I fell asleep before Mike...

1273
00:53:40,181 --> 00:53:42,252
he would always wake me up
so he wouldn't feel alone.

1274
00:53:42,416 --> 00:53:44,259
- That's kinda sweet.
- Yeah.

1275
00:53:44,418 --> 00:53:46,056
I don't know. I just...

1276
00:53:49,857 --> 00:53:51,234
Do you ever get that feeling...

1277
00:53:51,392 --> 00:53:54,896
that you're not good enough
to get what you really want...

1278
00:53:55,062 --> 00:53:56,871
so you're too scared to try?

1279
00:53:58,599 --> 00:53:59,907
All the time.

1280
00:54:00,601 --> 00:54:03,377
- Really?
- Like, all the time. It's terrifying.

1281
00:54:03,537 --> 00:54:05,414
- It is, it's terrifying.
- Yeah.

1282
00:54:05,573 --> 00:54:06,574
You're, like, stuck.

1283
00:54:06,741 --> 00:54:08,379
- Totally.
- Yeah.

1284
00:54:08,542 --> 00:54:10,044
Thanks. It's nice talking to you
about this.

1285
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:24,847
Hey. Where you going?

1286
00:54:24,927 --> 00:54:27,317
Is there a gang bang in the ballroom
you need to emcee?

1287
00:54:27,397 --> 00:54:28,876
Don't be such a drama king.

1288
00:54:28,965 --> 00:54:30,672
Yeah, I'm totally overreacting.

1289
00:54:30,833 --> 00:54:32,141
When you invite someone to a wedding...

1290
00:54:32,301 --> 00:54:34,557
they obviously are supposed to
finger diddle your family members.

1291
00:54:34,637 --> 00:54:35,638
That's common courtesy!

1292
00:54:35,805 --> 00:54:38,081
Okay, hold up. I am a grown-ass woman.

1293
00:54:38,274 --> 00:54:40,311
I can finger diddle whomever I want.

1294
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:42,946
Just because you say "whomever"
does not make it okay.

1295
00:54:43,112 --> 00:54:46,582
It's not a big deal.
It's just like texting someone.

1296
00:54:46,816 --> 00:54:48,762
- Oh.
- It's just like Tinder.

1297
00:54:48,918 --> 00:54:53,376
Swipe right, swipe right, swipe left.
Swipe left, swipe right.

1298
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:55,246
That's very graphic. That is...

1299
00:54:55,326 --> 00:54:58,466
Rotating your photos.
Expanding them, contracting them.

1300
00:54:58,630 --> 00:55:01,167
Are you deliberately trying to hurt me?
Is that what you're doing?

1301
00:55:01,332 --> 00:55:03,855
What? No!
I was just trying to get RiRi tickets...

1302
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:05,881
to make my best friend feel better, okay?

1303
00:55:06,037 --> 00:55:07,539
We're on vacay.

1304
00:55:09,607 --> 00:55:10,608
No...

1305
00:55:10,775 --> 00:55:14,484
You are invited to my sister's wedding.
You're supposed to smile, nod...

1306
00:55:14,646 --> 00:55:15,852
and do what I want you to do.

1307
00:55:16,014 --> 00:55:17,015
That's the deal.

1308
00:55:17,649 --> 00:55:19,458
I thought that we had a connection.

1309
00:55:20,018 --> 00:55:21,019
Like a spark.

1310
00:55:21,186 --> 00:55:24,133
You thought you were gonna bring me here
so that you could have sex with me.

1311
00:55:24,456 --> 00:55:26,911
Yes. No! What? Yeah, right.

1312
00:55:26,991 --> 00:55:27,992
Really?

1313
00:55:29,961 --> 00:55:31,668
Yes, obviously.

1314
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:33,869
You are so hot. And you smell good.

1315
00:55:34,034 --> 00:55:35,809
It's not a weird thing that I wanna have
sex with you...

1316
00:55:35,969 --> 00:55:37,915
because you are very sexy...

1317
00:55:38,071 --> 00:55:40,176
and you were leading me on,
and we are in Hawaii...

1318
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:42,217
which is a sexy place,
and people have sex here.

1319
00:55:42,375 --> 00:55:44,685
God, dude,
you built this all up in your head.

1320
00:55:44,845 --> 00:55:46,722
Alice and I just saw you on TV...

1321
00:55:46,913 --> 00:55:48,688
- wanted to go to Hawaii.
- Hold up.

1322
00:55:49,716 --> 00:55:50,717
Fuck.

1323
00:55:50,884 --> 00:55:51,885
You saw us on TV?

1324
00:55:52,052 --> 00:55:54,454
No, I don't even watch Wendy Williams.

1325
00:55:59,326 --> 00:56:00,327
What?

1326
00:56:01,561 --> 00:56:03,097
- What?
- Shh!

1327
00:56:03,196 --> 00:56:04,504
I thought you dug me.

1328
00:56:04,664 --> 00:56:05,938
Are you even a teacher?

1329
00:56:08,935 --> 00:56:09,936
No.

1330
00:56:10,103 --> 00:56:11,104
What about little Julio...

1331
00:56:11,271 --> 00:56:13,412
the dyslexic boy
who you taught how to read?

1332
00:56:13,575 --> 00:56:15,953
Made it up. All of it.

1333
00:56:16,111 --> 00:56:18,387
Although I did have sex
with this guy name Julio once...

1334
00:56:18,547 --> 00:56:20,049
and I'm pretty sure he couldn't read.

1335
00:56:21,016 --> 00:56:23,519
Here I thought you were Michelle Pfeiffer
from Dangerous Minds.

1336
00:56:23,685 --> 00:56:25,858
Turns out, you're Michelle Pfeiffer
from Scarface.

1337
00:56:26,555 --> 00:56:27,966
And you didn't even

1338
00:56:28,123 --> 00:56:31,502
say hello to my little friend.

1339
00:56:36,064 --> 00:56:37,941
Oh, come on, man.

1340
00:56:38,967 --> 00:56:40,071
Mike.

1341
00:56:53,751 --> 00:56:55,560
I'm really sorry. Um...

1342
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,757
I've been acting crazy.

1343
00:56:59,089 --> 00:57:01,712
It's probably about Luke, my ex.

1344
00:57:01,792 --> 00:57:04,966
Oh, yeah. The guy who
died in the plane crash...

1345
00:57:05,629 --> 00:57:07,768
with cancer, and AIDS, and stuff.

1346
00:57:07,932 --> 00:57:09,639
Yeah, that's the one.

1347
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:12,440
Except none of that stuff happened,
'cause, um...

1348
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,828
I lied.

1349
00:57:17,908 --> 00:57:18,909
You lied?

1350
00:57:21,045 --> 00:57:22,133
I can't do this.

1351
00:57:22,213 --> 00:57:23,214
Wait.

1352
00:57:23,314 --> 00:57:24,349
Sorry.

1353
00:57:24,448 --> 00:57:27,104
- That's okay. That's okay.
- Sorry everyone.

1354
00:57:27,184 --> 00:57:30,359
I just forgot my phone.
Can I grab my phone?

1355
00:57:31,089 --> 00:57:33,831
Sorry, I still don't want to get married.

1356
00:57:35,995 --> 00:57:40,175
Oh, my gosh. That's almost
as bad as the plane crash story.

1357
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,479
Why didn't you just tell me?

1358
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:46,643
I didn't want you to think
I was damaged goods.

1359
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,615
I would never think that.

1360
00:57:50,443 --> 00:57:51,649
"Love hurts.

1361
00:57:52,645 --> 00:57:54,318
"Love scars.

1362
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:58,292
"Love wounds, and mars."

1363
00:57:59,318 --> 00:58:03,494
That's from a really old song,
for old people.

1364
00:58:04,790 --> 00:58:06,565
Why are you so nice?

1365
00:58:09,563 --> 00:58:11,510
'Cause I think you're nice.

1366
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:19,741
David!

1367
00:58:20,642 --> 00:58:23,316
David, I need you here with me now.
Come on.

1368
00:58:23,478 --> 00:58:24,718
No. No.

1369
00:58:25,146 --> 00:58:27,524
Stangles, assemble. Now!

1370
00:58:27,682 --> 00:58:29,389
- Let's go.
- Is he okay?

1371
00:58:29,484 --> 00:58:30,471
Yeah, I think he's fine.

1372
00:58:30,551 --> 00:58:31,552
He's just got a lot on his mind.

1373
00:58:31,719 --> 00:58:32,740
Let's go!

1374
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:35,090
Okay, I'm coming, dude. Jeez.

1375
00:58:37,225 --> 00:58:38,397
Oh... I...

1376
00:58:38,493 --> 00:58:40,404
You gave me a boost up. Okay.

1377
00:58:48,102 --> 00:58:49,583
A line has been drawn, David.

1378
00:58:49,839 --> 00:58:52,329
A clear line in the sand.

1379
00:58:52,409 --> 00:58:53,997
Is that why you brought me
all the way down here...

1380
00:58:54,077 --> 00:58:56,199
so you could literally
draw a line in the sand?

1381
00:58:56,279 --> 00:58:57,467
I'm a visual thinker, David.

1382
00:58:57,547 --> 00:58:58,855
- God damn it!
- Son of a...

1383
00:59:00,150 --> 00:59:02,939
These girls, they've gotta go.

1384
00:59:03,019 --> 00:59:07,195
They pretended to dig us
just to get a free trip to Hawaii.

1385
00:59:07,357 --> 00:59:08,631
They're liars!

1386
00:59:08,792 --> 00:59:10,863
So what, man? So they lied.

1387
00:59:11,294 --> 00:59:12,682
I was talking to Alice.

1388
00:59:12,762 --> 00:59:14,708
You have no idea
what this girl's been through.

1389
00:59:14,864 --> 00:59:17,367
She needed this trip.
We might have saved her life.

1390
00:59:17,734 --> 00:59:20,624
We should be practicing our speech
for tonight.

1391
00:59:20,704 --> 00:59:23,116
Not babysitting the twins
from The Shining.

1392
00:59:25,975 --> 00:59:27,454
Oh, my God.

1393
00:59:27,610 --> 00:59:28,955
Why are you laughing at me?

1394
00:59:29,281 --> 00:59:31,203
You sound like mom and dad
when they're talking about us.

1395
00:59:31,283 --> 00:59:33,229
Well, no, fuck that noise.

1396
00:59:33,785 --> 00:59:35,374
Oh. Oh. Oh.

1397
00:59:35,454 --> 00:59:36,990
Guess what! You're gonna love this.

1398
00:59:37,155 --> 00:59:41,069
Tatiana was jerking off our cousin Terry.

1399
00:59:41,226 --> 00:59:42,881
- What?
- Mmm-hmm.

1400
00:59:42,961 --> 00:59:44,099
Cousin Terry has a dick?

1401
00:59:44,429 --> 00:59:46,018
No, not "jerking off" jerking off.

1402
00:59:46,098 --> 00:59:48,271
The female version of jerking.

1403
00:59:48,433 --> 00:59:50,106
Dude, let's just chill out...

1404
00:59:50,268 --> 00:59:52,407
focus on Jeanie,
and try not to be assholes...

1405
00:59:52,571 --> 00:59:53,892
for the rest of the weekend, okay?
Can we do that?

1406
00:59:53,972 --> 00:59:55,610
I can't do that, David.

1407
00:59:56,007 --> 00:59:58,078
Because I saw our little sister...

1408
00:59:58,910 --> 00:59:59,911
What?

1409
01:00:00,812 --> 01:00:03,190
Well, let's just say
she was making this face...

1410
01:00:05,584 --> 01:00:07,292
What? She saw a ghost?

1411
01:00:09,423 --> 01:00:10,834
She really had to pee?

1412
01:00:12,192 --> 01:00:13,193
Doing vocal warmups?

1413
01:00:14,061 --> 01:00:15,716
What are you doing?
It looks like you're having an orgasm.

1414
01:00:15,796 --> 01:00:19,141
She was, David! With the masseuse.

1415
01:00:19,666 --> 01:00:21,009
- What!
- Yes!

1416
01:00:21,201 --> 01:00:22,339
Oh, my God!

1417
01:00:22,469 --> 01:00:24,625
- She orgasms like a star.
- No!

1418
01:00:24,705 --> 01:00:25,877
What's next?

1419
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:30,611
I'm gonna walk in on mom
giving dad a Push Pop?

1420
01:00:31,278 --> 01:00:32,313
What's a Push Pop?

1421
01:00:32,446 --> 01:00:35,791
I made it up, Dave.
It's a sexual term that I just made up.

1422
01:00:35,949 --> 01:00:38,472
- What's a Push Pop?
- I don't know.

1423
01:00:38,552 --> 01:00:40,407
- What's a Push Pop?
- I don't know!

1424
01:00:40,487 --> 01:00:41,709
What's a Push Pop?

1425
01:00:41,789 --> 01:00:44,292
I've been to the bowels of the Internet,
and I've never seen a Push Pop.

1426
01:00:44,458 --> 01:00:46,028
God, just tell me! What's a Push Pop?

1427
01:00:46,194 --> 01:00:48,141
It's a whole hand up an ass, David.

1428
01:00:48,297 --> 01:00:50,208
Is that what you want me to say?

1429
01:00:50,366 --> 01:00:53,745
- Oh, God!
- Two hands pushin' the pop.

1430
01:00:53,836 --> 01:00:55,907
- Oh, God.
- Is that what you want me to say?

1431
01:00:56,005 --> 01:00:57,541
I'll send you some links.

1432
01:01:16,926 --> 01:01:19,031
- We're at table two.
- I'll be at the bar.

1433
01:01:19,195 --> 01:01:20,731
- I said table two.
- I'll be at the bar!

1434
01:01:20,896 --> 01:01:22,068
You're out of control!

1435
01:01:22,898 --> 01:01:23,899
Thank you.

1436
01:01:25,034 --> 01:01:26,606
Trouble in paradise?

1437
01:01:30,775 --> 01:01:33,654
Freaking I don't care if I cause a scene.

1438
01:01:33,811 --> 01:01:37,759
Freaking I will punch you 17,000 times
in the face. Freaking.

1439
01:01:37,915 --> 01:01:38,916
Take a shot.

1440
01:01:39,417 --> 01:01:41,988
You look like Don Johnson
fucked Zack Morris.

1441
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:45,599
Wait till Tatiana hears your shitty speech
after my crazy dope one.

1442
01:01:45,756 --> 01:01:47,133
She's never gonna
touch your baby bird again.

1443
01:01:48,827 --> 01:01:50,900
Thriller-Terry out!

1444
01:01:52,563 --> 01:01:54,065
So sad!

1445
01:01:54,232 --> 01:01:55,472
Oh, my God. It's a movie about cameras

1446
01:01:55,566 --> 01:01:56,840
just following you everywhere.

1447
01:01:57,068 --> 01:01:59,390
- Like The Truman Show.
- Yeah! Exactly like The Truman Show!

1448
01:01:59,470 --> 01:02:01,177
Hey, Dave! Dave!

1449
01:02:01,339 --> 01:02:02,579
Hey, what's up?

1450
01:02:02,740 --> 01:02:05,398
I need you to come backstage right now
and practice the speech.

1451
01:02:05,478 --> 01:02:06,684
Uh...

1452
01:02:06,779 --> 01:02:08,850
Dude, I'm kind of
talking to Alice right now.

1453
01:02:09,015 --> 01:02:10,756
Which is a conversation
you've now interrupted twice.

1454
01:02:10,917 --> 01:02:12,123
Our speech needs to kill.

1455
01:02:12,285 --> 01:02:14,322
Terry got a punch up from Chris Rock.

1456
01:02:14,587 --> 01:02:17,033
I didn't want to tell you before
because I didn't want you to freak out.

1457
01:02:17,190 --> 01:02:18,191
I'm not freaking out.

1458
01:02:18,324 --> 01:02:19,667
Calm the fuck down, Dave!

1459
01:02:19,826 --> 01:02:20,964
You calm the fuck down!

1460
01:02:21,127 --> 01:02:22,902
Mike, you look like
your face is gonna pop.

1461
01:02:23,129 --> 01:02:24,918
You gonna come or what?

1462
01:02:24,998 --> 01:02:26,386
Let's go.

1463
01:02:26,466 --> 01:02:28,339
I'll see you backstage.

1464
01:02:30,570 --> 01:02:31,591
Uh...

1465
01:02:31,671 --> 01:02:33,760
- I'm gonna go deal with this real quick.
- Okay.

1466
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:35,786
I'll just talk to myself for a while.
All alone.

1467
01:02:39,045 --> 01:02:40,820
...look on your stupid face!

1468
01:02:40,914 --> 01:02:42,402
What's wrong with me?

1469
01:02:42,482 --> 01:02:44,138
Don't fucking look at her. Turn around.

1470
01:02:44,218 --> 01:02:45,607
Everybody get the fuck out of here.

1471
01:02:45,687 --> 01:02:47,030
Fuck you, Luke.

1472
01:02:47,389 --> 01:02:50,160
I'm just gonna have
a little lie down, okay?

1473
01:03:01,937 --> 01:03:03,109
Hi!

1474
01:03:03,271 --> 01:03:04,693
- Hi!
- Hi!

1475
01:03:04,773 --> 01:03:06,895
Did you need to
take a little breather, too?

1476
01:03:06,975 --> 01:03:08,477
No. Why? Are you?

1477
01:03:09,343 --> 01:03:10,665
Well...

1478
01:03:10,745 --> 01:03:14,102
You know, you think that
every moment is going to feel...

1479
01:03:14,182 --> 01:03:16,471
warm and glowy...

1480
01:03:16,551 --> 01:03:18,373
and absolutely magical.

1481
01:03:18,453 --> 01:03:21,400
But, then, some stuff happens.

1482
01:03:22,390 --> 01:03:23,964
- Sure does.
- Yeah.

1483
01:03:25,963 --> 01:03:29,172
Well, if you want
warm, glowy and magical...

1484
01:03:30,033 --> 01:03:31,103
I have just the thing.

1485
01:03:31,735 --> 01:03:32,907
I don't leave home without it.

1486
01:03:35,739 --> 01:03:37,294
- Ecstasy.
- Oh!

1487
01:03:37,374 --> 01:03:39,997
Every bride deserves to have a little fun
the night before her wedding!

1488
01:03:40,077 --> 01:03:42,057
Yeah. I deserve to have a little fun.

1489
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:45,021
You are so nice to me.

1490
01:03:45,248 --> 01:03:46,249
Aww.

1491
01:03:49,286 --> 01:03:50,942
This is gonna be so much fun!

1492
01:03:51,022 --> 01:03:53,957
- We should find something to suck on.
- What? Oh.

1493
01:03:54,324 --> 01:03:56,664
- Mike!
- Here. Put these on.

1494
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:58,332
- We need headsets?
- Yeah!

1495
01:03:58,695 --> 01:04:00,984
There's a lot of dancing
in our speech, my man. Right?

1496
01:04:01,064 --> 01:04:02,253
Gotta go hands free.

1497
01:04:02,333 --> 01:04:03,889
This is how we do it, baby.

1498
01:04:03,969 --> 01:04:05,991
Come on. Hey, check this out.

1499
01:04:06,071 --> 01:04:08,127
I'm going to "wedding crash" cousin Terry.

1500
01:04:08,207 --> 01:04:09,261
What?

1501
01:04:09,341 --> 01:04:10,362
Put a few eye drops in her drink.

1502
01:04:10,442 --> 01:04:12,197
That way she shits all night,
and can't do the speech.

1503
01:04:12,277 --> 01:04:13,449
Just like in the movie Wedding Crashers.

1504
01:04:13,646 --> 01:04:15,367
Mike, that is a terrible idea.

1505
01:04:15,447 --> 01:04:17,703
- You've seen the movie!
- Of course I've seen the movie.

1506
01:04:17,783 --> 01:04:19,672
- You love that movie.
- Everyone loves that movie.

1507
01:04:19,752 --> 01:04:21,173
How's it a bad idea if you love the movie?

1508
01:04:21,253 --> 01:04:23,208
I love Taken.
I don't want to go steal little girls.

1509
01:04:23,288 --> 01:04:24,977
But we shouldn't wedding crash
our own cousin.

1510
01:04:25,057 --> 01:04:26,278
I'm worried about you, man.

1511
01:04:26,358 --> 01:04:28,235
I'm really worried
that you're losing your mind.

1512
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:29,964
The look in your eyes right now...

1513
01:04:30,195 --> 01:04:32,151
You haven't blinked
since we've started talking.

1514
01:04:32,231 --> 01:04:33,676
Oh, Davie, Davie, Davie!

1515
01:04:33,899 --> 01:04:34,969
What?

1516
01:04:35,367 --> 01:04:37,973
I've never been in more control
in my entire life.

1517
01:04:41,224 --> 01:04:42,953
Mike!

1518
01:04:43,253 --> 01:04:44,408
Mike!

1519
01:04:44,508 --> 01:04:45,622
This is really intense.

1520
01:04:46,247 --> 01:04:47,868
Yeah, it's hitting me really hard.

1521
01:04:47,948 --> 01:04:49,825
This is good ecstasy.

1522
01:04:50,284 --> 01:04:52,093
I don't know. I wouldn't know.
It's my first time.

1523
01:04:52,286 --> 01:04:53,674
- Wait, what?
- What?

1524
01:04:53,754 --> 01:04:56,077
Why would you take ecstasy
for the first time

1525
01:04:56,157 --> 01:04:57,578
on the night before your wedding?

1526
01:04:57,658 --> 01:04:58,659
What?

1527
01:04:58,759 --> 01:05:00,136
That is so baller!

1528
01:05:00,961 --> 01:05:02,838
Like a tiny blonde gangsta!

1529
01:05:02,963 --> 01:05:05,306
This little gangsta would kill
for a motherfucking ginger ale!

1530
01:05:06,467 --> 01:05:07,537
- Do you wanna go?
- Mmm-hmm.

1531
01:05:07,635 --> 01:05:09,090
Okay, let's go.

1532
01:05:09,170 --> 01:05:11,013
Hello, everyone. Please take your seats.

1533
01:05:11,405 --> 01:05:15,714
Welcome to the rehearsal dinner
for my man, Eric...

1534
01:05:15,810 --> 01:05:18,154
and his bride-to-be, the lovely Jeanie.

1535
01:05:18,245 --> 01:05:21,160
They're two of the sweetest, best people
I ever met.

1536
01:05:21,284 --> 01:05:23,560
All right. Our first speaker tonight...

1537
01:05:23,653 --> 01:05:25,441
is resident nasty girl...

1538
01:05:25,521 --> 01:05:27,659
Cousin Terry.

1539
01:05:28,057 --> 01:05:29,593
We can't let Terry crush.

1540
01:05:29,892 --> 01:05:30,947
It's not fair!

1541
01:05:31,027 --> 01:05:32,233
No. Give it to me.

1542
01:05:32,328 --> 01:05:34,035
My eyes are dry. Just give it to me.

1543
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:36,034
Do you guys know who Chris Rock is?

1544
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:39,637
He's my neighbor, and he helped me out
with a little something I like to call...

1545
01:05:39,902 --> 01:05:41,257
"My speech."

1546
01:05:41,337 --> 01:05:43,960
Stop. You're wasting it.
You're wasting the poison.

1547
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:45,161
Mike, this is baby safe.

1548
01:05:45,241 --> 01:05:48,197
They removed the active ingredient,
Tetrahydrozoline, like 20 years ago!

1549
01:05:48,277 --> 01:05:49,499
It worked on Wedding Crashers!

1550
01:05:49,579 --> 01:05:51,100
That was not real life!

1551
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:53,786
Now let's talk about destination weddings!

1552
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:55,905
It's like a vacation...

1553
01:05:55,985 --> 01:05:57,828
without the relaxation!

1554
01:05:59,523 --> 01:06:00,679
That's true.

1555
01:06:00,759 --> 01:06:01,760
Why aren't you on my side, Dave?

1556
01:06:02,193 --> 01:06:03,214
What?

1557
01:06:03,294 --> 01:06:05,706
I'm done with this shit, man.
I'm not doing our stupid speech.

1558
01:06:05,930 --> 01:06:08,119
In fact, I'm quitting our liquor business.

1559
01:06:08,199 --> 01:06:09,303
There it is!

1560
01:06:09,534 --> 01:06:10,604
- Really?
- Yeah.

1561
01:06:10,702 --> 01:06:11,806
And what are you gonna do?

1562
01:06:11,936 --> 01:06:13,291
I'm gonna draw!

1563
01:06:13,371 --> 01:06:16,494
I'm gonna work on my graphic novel,
and Mom's gonna help me cover the rent.

1564
01:06:16,574 --> 01:06:17,644
Boom!

1565
01:06:17,842 --> 01:06:18,863
You traitor!

1566
01:06:18,943 --> 01:06:19,978
I ain't gotta rehearse!

1567
01:06:20,512 --> 01:06:23,320
I know how to eat dinner.

1568
01:06:25,483 --> 01:06:26,518
Keith, can you turn me up a little bit?

1569
01:06:27,418 --> 01:06:30,430
You turn your back on me
when everyone else does.

1570
01:06:30,655 --> 01:06:33,663
Backstabbing, treacherous lying coward!

1571
01:06:33,892 --> 01:06:35,146
Ooh, I don't think they know they're on.

1572
01:06:35,226 --> 01:06:36,637
What? Where is that coming from?

1573
01:06:36,995 --> 01:06:38,235
I don't know what I did!

1574
01:06:38,329 --> 01:06:39,653
It doesn't matter, Mike.

1575
01:06:39,733 --> 01:06:41,144
You're losing your mind.

1576
01:06:41,334 --> 01:06:43,280
You just tried to poison our cousin Terry!

1577
01:06:44,638 --> 01:06:45,859
Try a little harder. Am I right?

1578
01:06:45,939 --> 01:06:47,094
You're goddamn right I did.

1579
01:06:47,174 --> 01:06:50,212
Because I wanted her to shit
hot brown poop all over that stage.

1580
01:06:51,111 --> 01:06:52,466
That is unacceptable.

1581
01:06:52,546 --> 01:06:54,401
The mics are on, boys.

1582
01:06:54,481 --> 01:06:57,370
I wanted her butt to explode
like a rotten cantaloupe.

1583
01:06:57,450 --> 01:06:58,638
The mics are on!

1584
01:06:58,718 --> 01:07:01,790
You're just fucking pissed off
because Tatiana finger diddled Terry.

1585
01:07:03,122 --> 01:07:04,663
There it is!

1586
01:07:04,925 --> 01:07:06,795
It was for tickets to Rihanna.

1587
01:07:06,927 --> 01:07:08,838
You're sad, man. You are sad.

1588
01:07:09,229 --> 01:07:11,835
I'm gonna kick your ass
just like when we were kids.

1589
01:07:16,403 --> 01:07:17,678
- Oh!
- My God!

1590
01:07:19,908 --> 01:07:21,163
- Do you wanna go?
- Don't do it!

1591
01:07:21,243 --> 01:07:22,464
These are coming your way.

1592
01:07:22,544 --> 01:07:23,879
Just stop!

1593
01:07:24,713 --> 01:07:26,386
God! That had to hurt.

1594
01:07:26,715 --> 01:07:28,023
Don't do it again.

1595
01:07:28,483 --> 01:07:29,484
Oh!

1596
01:07:31,753 --> 01:07:32,975
Why do you keep punching me?

1597
01:07:33,055 --> 01:07:34,466
Why do you keep rushing at me?

1598
01:07:34,623 --> 01:07:35,795
Get him, Dave.

1599
01:07:35,891 --> 01:07:37,012
Oops, who said that?

1600
01:07:37,092 --> 01:07:38,730
This wedding is going to hell!

1601
01:07:38,827 --> 01:07:39,982
Yes.

1602
01:07:40,062 --> 01:07:42,167
They're out there,
smiling like fucking idiots.

1603
01:07:42,731 --> 01:07:44,904
And they don't realize the bride...

1604
01:07:45,067 --> 01:07:46,989
is getting off at massage parlors...

1605
01:07:47,069 --> 01:07:49,378
like a goddamn Vietnam War veteran.

1606
01:07:50,939 --> 01:07:53,462
I think they misunderstood what happened.
I think they just misunderstood.

1607
01:07:53,542 --> 01:07:55,664
I walked in and saw little Jeanie...

1608
01:07:55,744 --> 01:07:57,534
the bride-to-be, orgasming.

1609
01:07:57,615 --> 01:08:00,004
The masseuse got her off.

1610
01:08:00,084 --> 01:08:01,438
God damn it!

1611
01:08:01,518 --> 01:08:02,588
Jeanie!

1612
01:08:03,020 --> 01:08:04,021
I hate you!

1613
01:08:18,102 --> 01:08:19,911
The rehearsal dinner is over.

1614
01:08:20,604 --> 01:08:23,608
Drinks by the pool, everybody.
Drinks by the pool.

1615
01:08:27,244 --> 01:08:29,781
Everything feels so good, right?

1616
01:08:29,914 --> 01:08:30,915
Yep.

1617
01:08:31,315 --> 01:08:32,837
You know what
I've been thinking about a lot?

1618
01:08:32,917 --> 01:08:33,987
Tell me.

1619
01:08:34,084 --> 01:08:36,007
Eric is so sweet and sensitive.

1620
01:08:36,087 --> 01:08:38,110
Kind, good, fiancé.

1621
01:08:38,190 --> 01:08:39,726
Probably great husband and stuff, but...

1622
01:08:40,826 --> 01:08:42,615
Do you think Eric is boring?

1623
01:08:42,695 --> 01:08:43,749
Boring?

1624
01:08:43,829 --> 01:08:45,001
Like for my honeymoon...

1625
01:08:45,431 --> 01:08:47,553
all I wanted to do
was go on a hot air balloon...

1626
01:08:47,633 --> 01:08:49,408
to different countries around the world.

1627
01:08:49,568 --> 01:08:51,757
And just be surrounded by wicker.

1628
01:08:51,837 --> 01:08:53,326
We could have wicker picnic baskets...

1629
01:08:53,406 --> 01:08:55,943
and I could make picnic hats
out of wicker.

1630
01:08:56,175 --> 01:08:58,164
We would be wearing
matching Chuck Taylors.

1631
01:08:58,244 --> 01:09:00,087
- And he vetoed it.
- Oh!

1632
01:09:00,513 --> 01:09:02,891
Because he wants to go to a resort,
and just...

1633
01:09:04,984 --> 01:09:06,539
- ...perch.
- What?

1634
01:09:06,619 --> 01:09:07,707
I am a young woman...

1635
01:09:07,787 --> 01:09:10,042
- Preach!
- There is so much for me to see.

1636
01:09:10,122 --> 01:09:12,432
- Yes.
- I haven't even been to Burning Man.

1637
01:09:12,892 --> 01:09:15,099
I don't even know what Amsterdam is like.

1638
01:09:15,629 --> 01:09:17,200
I haven't been to Seattle.

1639
01:09:17,332 --> 01:09:18,586
You've never been to Seattle?

1640
01:09:18,666 --> 01:09:19,687
No!

1641
01:09:19,767 --> 01:09:22,145
- Seattle's gonna change your fucking life!
- Really?

1642
01:09:22,236 --> 01:09:23,458
You need to get out of this cage!

1643
01:09:23,538 --> 01:09:24,592
I am in a cage...

1644
01:09:24,672 --> 01:09:27,152
just like these horses are caged.

1645
01:09:27,342 --> 01:09:29,219
Just let them out.

1646
01:09:29,410 --> 01:09:30,411
Huh?

1647
01:09:31,879 --> 01:09:32,983
Let them all out.

1648
01:09:39,387 --> 01:09:42,010
Be free! No one can hold you down!

1649
01:09:42,090 --> 01:09:45,230
Be free, my friends! Follow your dreams!

1650
01:10:10,820 --> 01:10:12,060
Here to pile on?

1651
01:10:12,422 --> 01:10:13,423
Go ahead.

1652
01:10:13,523 --> 01:10:14,811
Any insult you can think of...

1653
01:10:14,891 --> 01:10:16,393
I've probably told myself a million times.

1654
01:10:16,526 --> 01:10:18,199
Why were you trying to poison your cousin?

1655
01:10:20,397 --> 01:10:25,622
I was jealous of the whole
steam room incident.

1656
01:10:25,702 --> 01:10:28,512
That is some crazy shit.
That's like something I would do.

1657
01:10:28,738 --> 01:10:30,360
This one time in high school...

1658
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:31,928
this bitch tried to hit on my boyfriend...

1659
01:10:32,008 --> 01:10:33,597
and I cut off her ponytail
while she was sleeping...

1660
01:10:33,677 --> 01:10:35,133
and I wore it to school for a month.

1661
01:10:35,213 --> 01:10:36,335
What the fuck?

1662
01:10:36,415 --> 01:10:37,951
But you tried to poison your cousin.

1663
01:10:51,430 --> 01:10:54,411
Look. I'm sorry I've been so rough
on you, okay?

1664
01:10:54,633 --> 01:10:58,342
I honestly think it's
because you're so much like me.

1665
01:10:58,570 --> 01:11:00,525
You act all confident...

1666
01:11:00,605 --> 01:11:03,609
but, inside, you're scared of everything.

1667
01:11:03,842 --> 01:11:05,549
You act like you don't care
what people think...

1668
01:11:05,644 --> 01:11:07,214
but you really care what people think.

1669
01:11:07,312 --> 01:11:08,533
And you try to act so smart...

1670
01:11:08,613 --> 01:11:10,235
but sometimes...

1671
01:11:10,315 --> 01:11:13,526
you're just afraid
you're the dumbest person in the world.

1672
01:11:16,290 --> 01:11:17,894
I'm so dumb.

1673
01:11:18,392 --> 01:11:21,862
I'm constantly saying words
that I don't know the meaning of.

1674
01:11:22,529 --> 01:11:24,873
Like, I use this word, "assuage"...

1675
01:11:25,132 --> 01:11:26,509
all the time.

1676
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:28,746
Can you assuage me the ketchup?

1677
01:11:28,869 --> 01:11:30,780
Can I assuage you a few questions?

1678
01:11:30,971 --> 01:11:33,781
- Is that the meaning of it?
- I don't know.

1679
01:11:33,874 --> 01:11:35,329
But it's like, I'm so stupid...

1680
01:11:35,409 --> 01:11:37,664
but I act all confident,
so people listen to me.

1681
01:11:37,744 --> 01:11:38,814
And it's fucked up.

1682
01:11:39,012 --> 01:11:40,923
Me, too. I'm a natural born leader.

1683
01:11:41,148 --> 01:11:42,903
Like George Washington.

1684
01:11:42,983 --> 01:11:44,071
Yeah.

1685
01:11:44,151 --> 01:11:45,391
Or another leader.

1686
01:11:52,962 --> 01:11:54,350
All right, here's one.

1687
01:11:54,430 --> 01:11:56,501
But I'm about to get super real
with you. Okay?

1688
01:11:57,967 --> 01:12:01,608
I thought I was destined
for such great things...

1689
01:12:01,704 --> 01:12:04,378
but I may never achieve anything.

1690
01:12:07,910 --> 01:12:09,150
Sister.

1691
01:12:10,513 --> 01:12:12,424
Have you been reading my diary?

1692
01:12:21,490 --> 01:12:22,525
Yes.

1693
01:12:23,492 --> 01:12:24,596
Okay.

1694
01:12:37,074 --> 01:12:38,362
You are beautiful!

1695
01:12:38,442 --> 01:12:39,819
On to Seattle!

1696
01:12:39,977 --> 01:12:41,081
Alice?

1697
01:12:42,113 --> 01:12:43,114
Am I glowing?

1698
01:12:43,381 --> 01:12:45,454
I can see sounds and hear colors.

1699
01:12:45,549 --> 01:12:46,887
Be free!

1700
01:12:47,051 --> 01:12:48,655
What the fuck are the horses doing out?

1701
01:12:49,587 --> 01:12:50,998
Who the fuck are you guys?

1702
01:12:51,255 --> 01:12:52,461
Fucking gypsies!

1703
01:12:52,623 --> 01:12:54,762
Francisco! Francisco, run!

1704
01:12:55,159 --> 01:12:57,105
Whoa! Shit!

1705
01:12:59,931 --> 01:13:00,985
Hey.

1706
01:13:01,065 --> 01:13:02,635
Dave! Hi.

1707
01:13:04,268 --> 01:13:05,590
What's up? What's up with you?

1708
01:13:05,670 --> 01:13:07,946
- What's going on? Are you okay?
- Me?

1709
01:13:08,105 --> 01:13:10,245
Yeah. I'm fine.

1710
01:13:12,011 --> 01:13:13,456
Oh. Yeah. Well...

1711
01:13:14,013 --> 01:13:15,788
Yeah. See, what happened was that...

1712
01:13:15,949 --> 01:13:18,271
there was a tsunami,
and it took away our clothes...

1713
01:13:18,351 --> 01:13:19,572
but it brought these horses.

1714
01:13:19,652 --> 01:13:20,640
What?

1715
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:22,942
And then, we wanted to get naked
because of Lady Godiva...

1716
01:13:23,022 --> 01:13:24,797
but then horses can't eat chocolate.

1717
01:13:24,958 --> 01:13:26,938
They could have an aneurysm.

1718
01:13:27,093 --> 01:13:28,299
Where's Jeanie?

1719
01:13:28,394 --> 01:13:29,749
Hey, don't yell at her
just because she's the one...

1720
01:13:29,829 --> 01:13:31,417
- that told me to go to Seattle.
- Holy shit!

1721
01:13:31,497 --> 01:13:33,153
- I've always wanted to go!
- Oh, my God!

1722
01:13:33,233 --> 01:13:35,021
That is not her fault.

1723
01:13:35,101 --> 01:13:36,546
- Oh, my eyes!
- What's the matter?

1724
01:13:36,703 --> 01:13:38,291
Stop yelling. Why are you yelling?
David, stop yelling.

1725
01:13:38,371 --> 01:13:40,009
You're being loud. And this a happy time.

1726
01:13:40,173 --> 01:13:41,516
This a really good time.

1727
01:13:41,674 --> 01:13:42,829
There's nothing wrong. So who's at fault?

1728
01:13:42,909 --> 01:13:45,287
Did you know that Hitler's parents
were second cousins?

1729
01:13:45,478 --> 01:13:47,014
- Do you have any water?
- Put your clothes on!

1730
01:13:47,180 --> 01:13:50,389
I'm a woman, Dave. Deal with it.

1731
01:13:50,619 --> 01:13:54,328
Because this is the bush
that you came out of.

1732
01:13:54,489 --> 01:13:55,832
I didn't come from that bush.

1733
01:13:55,991 --> 01:13:57,698
I came from Mom's bush. And you know that.

1734
01:13:57,859 --> 01:13:59,304
Jeanie! Oh, my God!

1735
01:13:59,794 --> 01:14:01,171
You're completely naked!

1736
01:14:01,329 --> 01:14:03,673
- Hi, Becky!
- God, your bush is huge.

1737
01:14:03,832 --> 01:14:05,539
- You look tall.
- No, ma'am.

1738
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:08,112
I told you to stay away
from these bitches.

1739
01:14:08,370 --> 01:14:10,509
Alice, seriously, are you tripping?

1740
01:14:10,672 --> 01:14:11,660
No. God, no.

1741
01:14:11,740 --> 01:14:13,913
Why would say that?
Just because everything feels really soft?

1742
01:14:14,209 --> 01:14:15,813
Please. Just tell me the truth.

1743
01:14:15,977 --> 01:14:17,047
Are you on drugs?

1744
01:14:17,879 --> 01:14:19,324
We're super fucked up. Yeah.

1745
01:14:19,481 --> 01:14:20,502
What?

1746
01:14:20,582 --> 01:14:22,994
We started with ecstasy,
but then I went into my mystery bags.

1747
01:14:23,151 --> 01:14:24,528
Why the fuck would you do that?

1748
01:14:24,686 --> 01:14:25,907
Don't you judge me, David.

1749
01:14:25,987 --> 01:14:27,742
I don't think you're supposed to
go into the mystery bag...

1750
01:14:27,822 --> 01:14:28,893
the night before the wedding.

1751
01:14:29,059 --> 01:14:31,198
We brought you here
because we thought you were nice girls.

1752
01:14:31,361 --> 01:14:33,204
But Mike was right about you two.

1753
01:14:33,363 --> 01:14:35,604
This whole wedding weekend
is just going to shit!

1754
01:14:35,766 --> 01:14:37,575
Dave, I'll be honest with you.

1755
01:14:37,734 --> 01:14:38,872
I need some clothes.

1756
01:14:39,903 --> 01:14:41,382
I can't continue to wear this horse.

1757
01:14:41,538 --> 01:14:43,074
Oh, my God.

1758
01:14:43,607 --> 01:14:44,915
Oh, the wind feels so nice.

1759
01:14:45,075 --> 01:14:46,949
Come on, come on, come on.

1760
01:14:48,311 --> 01:14:52,202
We should go in the ocean. I'm so thirsty!
Dave, we should get in the ocean.

1761
01:14:52,282 --> 01:14:55,439
Please, please, please, just be quiet.

1762
01:14:55,519 --> 01:14:57,007
I love this song.

1763
01:14:57,087 --> 01:14:58,430
There's no music playing.

1764
01:14:59,556 --> 01:15:00,557
Baby, wait.

1765
01:15:00,724 --> 01:15:02,635
Don't worry. Only our butts touched.

1766
01:15:02,793 --> 01:15:04,739
Stop it. Don't freak out anymore, Pumpkin!

1767
01:15:04,895 --> 01:15:06,932
Don't freak out? Don't freak out?

1768
01:15:07,130 --> 01:15:08,475
Tell me one thing.

1769
01:15:08,701 --> 01:15:09,907
Did you enjoy it?

1770
01:15:10,469 --> 01:15:12,073
No.

1771
01:15:13,038 --> 01:15:14,426
That is such a "yes" no.

1772
01:15:14,506 --> 01:15:15,561
No.

1773
01:15:15,641 --> 01:15:18,030
I'm gonna ask you again. Did you enjoy it?

1774
01:15:18,110 --> 01:15:19,098
Yes! Oh.

1775
01:15:19,178 --> 01:15:20,213
Well...

1776
01:15:20,479 --> 01:15:22,049
Cat's out of the frigging bag, isn't it?

1777
01:15:22,214 --> 01:15:24,125
I went for a normal massage...

1778
01:15:24,283 --> 01:15:26,320
but Alice, she had asked
for a little special treat.

1779
01:15:26,485 --> 01:15:28,396
And then it just kept coming,
and coming, and coming, and...

1780
01:15:28,554 --> 01:15:30,659
Who are these fucking girls
your brothers brought to this wedding?

1781
01:15:31,090 --> 01:15:33,627
You are clearly on drugs.

1782
01:15:33,792 --> 01:15:35,271
And we're getting married tomorrow!

1783
01:15:36,095 --> 01:15:37,938
I'm scared, Pumpkin.

1784
01:15:38,097 --> 01:15:39,337
Aren't you scared?

1785
01:15:39,498 --> 01:15:41,307
Well, yeah, now I am.

1786
01:15:41,834 --> 01:15:43,142
It's just that...

1787
01:15:43,836 --> 01:15:48,287
I'm just a little worried that you are...

1788
01:15:49,810 --> 01:15:50,811
boring.

1789
01:15:52,346 --> 01:15:53,689
What are you saying?

1790
01:15:53,848 --> 01:15:55,054
You don't want to marry me?

1791
01:16:05,926 --> 01:16:07,200
Well...

1792
01:16:07,361 --> 01:16:08,965
No, she doesn't mean that.
She's just confused...

1793
01:16:09,130 --> 01:16:10,370
because she's just rolling
super hard right now.

1794
01:16:10,531 --> 01:16:11,635
You rolled her!

1795
01:16:11,799 --> 01:16:13,870
- You're the roller!
- I'm so sorry.

1796
01:16:14,034 --> 01:16:16,446
I was gonna draw Rum for you.
But not anymore.

1797
01:16:16,604 --> 01:16:18,584
Everything is not irie, man!

1798
01:16:21,008 --> 01:16:23,614
You've made me so, so sad.

1799
01:16:26,181 --> 01:16:27,559
But a little bit mad.

1800
01:16:28,317 --> 01:16:29,728
But mostly just sad.

1801
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:31,721
Oh!

1802
01:16:33,689 --> 01:16:34,997
- Dad!
- Don't!

1803
01:16:35,158 --> 01:16:36,569
Mike, for once in your life...

1804
01:16:36,726 --> 01:16:39,707
please don't say a fucking word.

1805
01:17:04,153 --> 01:17:05,930
I hate them sometimes.

1806
01:17:06,090 --> 01:17:07,345
Fucking love them and they're dicks.

1807
01:17:07,425 --> 01:17:09,166
Sometimes I love them,
sometimes I hate them.

1808
01:17:17,235 --> 01:17:18,236
Everything okay over there?

1809
01:17:18,403 --> 01:17:20,815
I can't find my other sock.
It's pissing me off.

1810
01:17:23,708 --> 01:17:25,449
Did you take my sock, bro?

1811
01:17:25,610 --> 01:17:26,680
No.

1812
01:17:27,178 --> 01:17:29,556
I think you took my fucking sock, bro.

1813
01:17:31,182 --> 01:17:32,252
God damn it.

1814
01:17:32,383 --> 01:17:34,488
I can't believe Jeanie and Eric
aren't getting married...

1815
01:17:34,619 --> 01:17:36,428
and it's all our fault.

1816
01:17:37,088 --> 01:17:40,069
It's slightly our fault.

1817
01:17:41,025 --> 01:17:42,971
It's totally our fault. Fuck.

1818
01:17:43,127 --> 01:17:45,473
We got selfish. We got distracted.

1819
01:17:47,067 --> 01:17:49,877
I don't think we were
#DoingltForJeanie at all.

1820
01:17:50,036 --> 01:17:51,913
We weren't #DoingltForJeanie.

1821
01:17:52,072 --> 01:17:54,916
Our fucking little sister.
Our little Jeanie Beanie Weanie.

1822
01:17:55,575 --> 01:17:57,452
She is Stanglita.

1823
01:17:57,611 --> 01:18:00,387
The one little girl
we used to let into our Stang Hangs.

1824
01:18:00,547 --> 01:18:01,535
The Stangle Dangle.

1825
01:18:01,615 --> 01:18:03,151
The smallest plane in the Stangar.

1826
01:18:03,316 --> 01:18:04,454
Don't do it, dude.

1827
01:18:04,618 --> 01:18:05,926
We're supposed to be her protector.

1828
01:18:06,086 --> 01:18:07,622
Don't you cry.

1829
01:18:07,787 --> 01:18:08,788
We're supposed to look out for her.

1830
01:18:08,955 --> 01:18:10,127
Stop it.

1831
01:18:10,290 --> 01:18:13,237
We're supposed to be the two dudes
that have her back no matter what.

1832
01:18:13,393 --> 01:18:14,838
If you start, I'm gonna start.

1833
01:18:14,995 --> 01:18:17,271
We broke up her marriage.

1834
01:18:20,066 --> 01:18:22,979
Of course I'm fucking doing it, man.
We ruined Jeanie's wedding.

1835
01:18:23,136 --> 01:18:24,583
I'm doing it, too.

1836
01:18:25,140 --> 01:18:26,317
I hate it.

1837
01:18:39,187 --> 01:18:41,810
Oh, man, we fucked up this wedding.

1838
01:18:41,890 --> 01:18:42,891
Yeah.

1839
01:18:43,058 --> 01:18:45,231
We fucked it in the dick.

1840
01:18:46,562 --> 01:18:48,217
You know I don't like it when you say that.
That's just...

1841
01:18:48,297 --> 01:18:51,005
I know, but we fucked it so hard. Fuck.

1842
01:18:51,099 --> 01:18:54,256
I think the reason we get ourselves
into so much shit is...

1843
01:18:54,336 --> 01:18:56,407
we're always telling each other
we're so awesome...

1844
01:18:56,672 --> 01:18:59,676
when we're definitely not being awesome.

1845
01:18:59,841 --> 01:19:01,149
That's deep.

1846
01:19:01,310 --> 01:19:03,121
Yeah, you know what? Um...

1847
01:19:04,715 --> 01:19:06,558
I wanted you to feel better...

1848
01:19:06,717 --> 01:19:08,890
and get your groove back...

1849
01:19:09,053 --> 01:19:12,193
but not all the way better to where...

1850
01:19:13,624 --> 01:19:15,626
you wouldn't need me anymore.

1851
01:19:15,793 --> 01:19:18,706
Because if you don't need me...

1852
01:19:20,197 --> 01:19:22,871
then nobody needs me, and, um...

1853
01:19:23,534 --> 01:19:26,811
Anyway, that's what I was thinking
when I was knuckles deep into Cousin Terry.

1854
01:19:27,471 --> 01:19:29,417
Dude, we're always gonna need each other.

1855
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:31,041
Okay.

1856
01:19:31,308 --> 01:19:35,351
Okay, here's the thing.
I don't wanna stop being us.

1857
01:19:35,512 --> 01:19:37,583
But I think occasionally...

1858
01:19:37,748 --> 01:19:41,993
we should think about
how we make other people feel.

1859
01:19:44,290 --> 01:19:45,278
Like Jeanie?

1860
01:19:45,358 --> 01:19:46,564
Yeah, like Jeanie.

1861
01:19:47,026 --> 01:19:48,733
- Oof.
- Or like Eric.

1862
01:19:49,195 --> 01:19:50,230
Oh, fuck.

1863
01:19:50,396 --> 01:19:52,034
This feels fucking terrible.

1864
01:19:52,198 --> 01:19:54,405
This does not feel good.

1865
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:57,342
Like, Dave's so special and...

1866
01:19:58,070 --> 01:20:00,448
He must be so mad at me.

1867
01:20:00,873 --> 01:20:01,943
Poor Mike.

1868
01:20:02,108 --> 01:20:05,453
He's less special,
but I played him so hard.

1869
01:20:05,611 --> 01:20:07,056
They must be so mad at us!

1870
01:20:07,213 --> 01:20:09,420
They must hate us. Fuck! I would hate us.

1871
01:20:09,582 --> 01:20:11,391
I would fucking hate us!

1872
01:20:11,550 --> 01:20:13,894
I hate us, man. I hate us!

1873
01:20:14,053 --> 01:20:15,191
I hate us, too!

1874
01:20:15,354 --> 01:20:17,061
But you're the best, dude. I love you.

1875
01:20:17,223 --> 01:20:19,567
Don't lump yourself in with me.

1876
01:20:19,725 --> 01:20:21,205
I'm like a little troll...

1877
01:20:21,362 --> 01:20:24,138
who lives on nothing but
river water and squirrel meats.

1878
01:20:24,298 --> 01:20:26,710
Your drawing?
I could never do anything like that.

1879
01:20:26,868 --> 01:20:29,057
- So go. You go right now.
- What?

1880
01:20:29,137 --> 01:20:30,191
Go!

1881
01:20:30,271 --> 01:20:33,650
Don't let your loser older brother
hold you back.

1882
01:20:37,111 --> 01:20:38,454
You are not a loser.

1883
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:40,782
Thanks, Dave.

1884
01:20:40,948 --> 01:20:42,450
Dude, you introduced me
to the Ninja Turtles.

1885
01:20:42,617 --> 01:20:44,460
Taught me Donatello was a pussy.

1886
01:20:44,619 --> 01:20:46,496
That Raphael was actually dope...

1887
01:20:46,654 --> 01:20:48,634
because he didn't give a fuck
what people thought.

1888
01:20:48,790 --> 01:20:50,064
He's cool, but rude.

1889
01:20:50,224 --> 01:20:51,464
Exactly.

1890
01:20:51,559 --> 01:20:53,664
When all those kids kicked at me
and they called me "Moist"...

1891
01:20:53,761 --> 01:20:56,640
you stopped eating muffins
at the school lunch for a year.

1892
01:20:56,798 --> 01:20:58,471
They were too moist.

1893
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:01,513
Made you an easy target.

1894
01:21:01,671 --> 01:21:05,175
You're my brother. And I love you.

1895
01:21:05,341 --> 01:21:06,911
Heroes in a half shell.

1896
01:21:07,077 --> 01:21:08,181
Turtle power.

1897
01:21:13,249 --> 01:21:15,456
We're not going anywhere...

1898
01:21:15,618 --> 01:21:19,293
until our little sister,
Jeanie Beanie Weanie...

1899
01:21:19,456 --> 01:21:21,163
is getting married.

1900
01:21:26,863 --> 01:21:28,103
You just killed the TV.

1901
01:21:28,631 --> 01:21:30,372
I was aiming for it.

1902
01:21:32,836 --> 01:21:35,646
We are such idiots. We are so stupid.

1903
01:21:35,805 --> 01:21:37,307
We ruined your whole wedding...

1904
01:21:37,474 --> 01:21:39,182
and we finally just realized that.

1905
01:21:39,343 --> 01:21:41,324
All right. Please just stop talking, okay?

1906
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:44,654
Not another word. My head hurts so bad.

1907
01:21:44,816 --> 01:21:46,022
Jeanie, Eric.

1908
01:21:46,184 --> 01:21:48,892
We can't let you not get married
just because we fucked everything up.

1909
01:21:49,054 --> 01:21:50,192
We love you so much, Jeanie.

1910
01:21:50,288 --> 01:21:52,359
We love you, Eric.
We just want you guys to love each other.

1911
01:21:52,457 --> 01:21:53,958
- Just love each other.
- That's it.

1912
01:21:55,527 --> 01:21:56,801
Jeanie, Eric.

1913
01:21:56,962 --> 01:21:58,464
We can't let you not get married.

1914
01:21:58,630 --> 01:22:00,234
Yeah. Just because
we fucked everything up?

1915
01:22:00,398 --> 01:22:01,843
I mean, we want you guys
to love each other.

1916
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,001
Love each other.

1917
01:22:04,169 --> 01:22:07,048
Okay. This is bizarre,
because we literally did that...

1918
01:22:07,205 --> 01:22:08,582
...exact same thing.

1919
01:22:08,740 --> 01:22:10,378
We're even doing this hand motion.

1920
01:22:10,542 --> 01:22:11,714
Yeah, all that was ours.

1921
01:22:11,877 --> 01:22:13,914
The point is, this shit is all our fault.

1922
01:22:14,079 --> 01:22:15,717
No, it's our fault.

1923
01:22:15,881 --> 01:22:17,554
No, it's definitely our fault.

1924
01:22:17,716 --> 01:22:18,822
It is our fault for sure.

1925
01:22:18,986 --> 01:22:19,987
No, no, no. For real.

1926
01:22:20,154 --> 01:22:21,599
If anything, it's my fault.

1927
01:22:23,323 --> 01:22:24,927
Shh! Please stop.

1928
01:22:27,194 --> 01:22:31,301
Everyone shut the fuck up!

1929
01:22:31,965 --> 01:22:34,309
Jesus Hussein Christ.

1930
01:22:34,468 --> 01:22:36,414
God damn it!

1931
01:22:36,537 --> 01:22:38,813
Been trying to read this same paragraph...

1932
01:22:39,039 --> 01:22:40,327
for 20 minutes.

1933
01:22:40,407 --> 01:22:44,947
But you four fucking morons
keep on fucking with my shit.

1934
01:22:45,646 --> 01:22:47,267
We've only been here for three minutes...

1935
01:22:47,347 --> 01:22:48,535
so those other 17 minutes...

1936
01:22:48,615 --> 01:22:49,803
- that's kind of on you...
- Mike!

1937
01:22:49,883 --> 01:22:51,138
I'm using hyperbole.

1938
01:22:51,218 --> 01:22:54,062
I don't know what that means,
and I think you know that I don't.

1939
01:22:54,188 --> 01:22:56,176
Mike, do me a favor. Shut the fuck up.

1940
01:22:56,256 --> 01:22:57,244
Go Eric.

1941
01:22:57,324 --> 01:22:58,380
Shut up too!

1942
01:22:58,460 --> 01:22:59,734
I mean, God damn it!

1943
01:22:59,895 --> 01:23:03,035
You're all self-absorbed,
barely-functioning...

1944
01:23:03,599 --> 01:23:04,839
codependent weirdos!

1945
01:23:06,001 --> 01:23:07,309
- Yeah.
- I know.

1946
01:23:07,403 --> 01:23:09,508
- That's pretty spot-on.
- We just figured that out.

1947
01:23:09,672 --> 01:23:12,428
- Those are not good qualities.
- We're gonna work on it.

1948
01:23:12,508 --> 01:23:14,497
- It's been a long time.
- It's been so many years.

1949
01:23:14,577 --> 01:23:16,181
We're both very confused.

1950
01:23:16,278 --> 01:23:18,383
No, no. You're not confused.

1951
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:20,603
You're just coming down off MDMA.

1952
01:23:20,683 --> 01:23:22,162
Sorry. Which I gave you.

1953
01:23:22,318 --> 01:23:24,992
And Eric, you can't blame her
for anything she said last night.

1954
01:23:25,154 --> 01:23:27,930
I've done so much stupid shit on E.

1955
01:23:28,090 --> 01:23:30,661
I got so dehydrated that
I was drinking puddle water...

1956
01:23:30,826 --> 01:23:31,998
and I had to go to the hospital...

1957
01:23:32,161 --> 01:23:34,767
'cause puddles are really dirty.

1958
01:23:34,964 --> 01:23:36,418
One time I was on peyote...

1959
01:23:36,498 --> 01:23:38,756
and I signed up for a T-Mobile plan.

1960
01:23:38,836 --> 01:23:40,591
One time I got high.

1961
01:23:40,671 --> 01:23:43,174
I read the back of a shampoo bottle
for 13 hours.

1962
01:23:44,208 --> 01:23:45,363
Because it said "repeat."

1963
01:23:45,443 --> 01:23:46,979
- Rinse and repeat.
- I get it.

1964
01:23:47,078 --> 01:23:50,116
Jeanie, I know you think
that Eric can be boring...

1965
01:23:50,381 --> 01:23:52,987
Enough of this talk of boring!

1966
01:23:53,517 --> 01:23:54,572
Damn it!

1967
01:23:54,652 --> 01:23:58,862
Sixty percent of my investments
are in some pretty aggressive stocks.

1968
01:23:58,990 --> 01:24:02,369
I don't always look both ways
when I cross the street.

1969
01:24:02,526 --> 01:24:05,516
I've been known to have
a second glass of wine...

1970
01:24:05,596 --> 01:24:07,418
with my dinner, every now and then.

1971
01:24:07,498 --> 01:24:09,153
I once went to see a movie...

1972
01:24:09,233 --> 01:24:11,722
walked across the hallway,
saw a second movie.

1973
01:24:11,802 --> 01:24:13,110
Didn't pay till after.

1974
01:24:13,304 --> 01:24:14,476
Is that boring?

1975
01:24:14,972 --> 01:24:15,961
Is that boring?

1976
01:24:16,041 --> 01:24:17,197
- What'd you say?
- Yeah.

1977
01:24:17,277 --> 01:24:18,813
- You're right. We were wrong.
- That was pretty boring.

1978
01:24:19,245 --> 01:24:20,485
Well, how about this for boring?

1979
01:24:22,348 --> 01:24:24,089
Bam!

1980
01:24:24,583 --> 01:24:26,856
Two hot air balloon tickets
for our honeymoon.

1981
01:24:26,986 --> 01:24:28,241
I know you really wanted to go...

1982
01:24:28,321 --> 01:24:31,200
so I got these tickets a while ago
to surprise you.

1983
01:24:31,557 --> 01:24:33,400
Surprise.

1984
01:24:33,559 --> 01:24:35,664
Aww!

1985
01:24:35,895 --> 01:24:37,397
Baby, you're so afraid of heights.

1986
01:24:38,031 --> 01:24:40,477
- Baby, I'm fucking terrified of heights.
- Yeah.

1987
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:43,022
But my biggest fear...

1988
01:24:43,102 --> 01:24:45,241
is to not be the husband that you deserve.

1989
01:24:46,539 --> 01:24:49,418
Baby, I'm sorry I fucked
so much of this up...

1990
01:24:50,109 --> 01:24:51,231
but I promise that masseuse...

1991
01:24:51,311 --> 01:24:53,299
He didn't touch my lavender juice box.

1992
01:24:53,379 --> 01:24:55,223
Oh God, baby. I love you.

1993
01:24:55,784 --> 01:24:57,525
And I know I want to marry you.

1994
01:24:57,852 --> 01:25:00,765
Today, if you'll still have me.

1995
01:25:01,256 --> 01:25:03,702
Babe, of course. Are you kidding me?

1996
01:25:07,162 --> 01:25:08,149
Kiss her.

1997
01:25:08,229 --> 01:25:10,072
Baby, I'm crazy about you.

1998
01:25:22,544 --> 01:25:23,545
Aww!

1999
01:25:24,279 --> 01:25:25,781
I want to marry you right now...

2000
01:25:25,947 --> 01:25:27,893
but, baby, we already canceled
all the vendors.

2001
01:25:28,383 --> 01:25:30,124
I don't think they're going to
let us get married here.

2002
01:25:31,686 --> 01:25:32,756
Leave that to us.

2003
01:25:34,223 --> 01:25:35,862
Leave that to all of us.

2004
01:25:37,194 --> 01:25:38,332
- Yeah!
- Let's go, Mike.

2005
01:25:38,962 --> 01:25:40,532
This way! Oh, fuck!

2006
01:25:40,964 --> 01:25:42,443
We'll actually just head around.

2007
01:25:42,699 --> 01:25:44,178
- Girl.
- I'm good.

2008
01:25:44,468 --> 01:25:45,923
So what part you like, brah?

2009
01:25:46,003 --> 01:25:48,158
- We need the whole pig.
- I can't give you a whole pig.

2010
01:25:48,238 --> 01:25:49,774
But we need to feed 100 people.

2011
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:53,063
Could we please, please
have the wedding here?

2012
01:25:53,143 --> 01:25:55,180
For the last time, we're out of venues.

2013
01:25:55,312 --> 01:25:57,656
- Hold me back. Hold me back, please.
- What?

2014
01:25:57,914 --> 01:25:58,936
Give us a place!

2015
01:25:59,016 --> 01:26:00,791
Everybody out of the way!

2016
01:26:00,984 --> 01:26:02,639
It's hot. So hot!

2017
01:26:02,719 --> 01:26:04,221
- Out of the fucking way!
- I want my pig back!

2018
01:26:04,988 --> 01:26:06,777
What if I supplied all the liquor...

2019
01:26:06,857 --> 01:26:08,845
for every bar in this hotel...

2020
01:26:08,925 --> 01:26:11,515
at wholesale prices
for the next three years?

2021
01:26:11,595 --> 01:26:13,473
- Deal.
- Yes! Fuck yes!

2022
01:26:13,665 --> 01:26:14,939
I'll get you guys a venue.

2023
01:26:28,914 --> 01:26:29,915
Keith, get it together.

2024
01:26:30,249 --> 01:26:31,421
We need to move, move, move.

2025
01:26:31,650 --> 01:26:32,720
I'm doing my best.

2026
01:26:36,388 --> 01:26:37,492
Hell yeah!

2027
01:26:55,443 --> 01:26:58,020
And now... a reading...

2028
01:26:58,679 --> 01:27:00,818
from the children's book
that I got in the lobby.

2029
01:27:01,115 --> 01:27:02,753
- Oh.
- "Aloha moon.

2030
01:27:03,150 --> 01:27:04,823
"Aloha sea.

2031
01:27:04,985 --> 01:27:06,362
"Aloha you.

2032
01:27:06,987 --> 01:27:08,057
"Aloha me."

2033
01:27:08,355 --> 01:27:09,925
- I do.
- I do.

2034
01:27:10,124 --> 01:27:11,467
By the power vested in me...

2035
01:27:11,659 --> 01:27:15,197
by the website www.beyourowndeacon.com...

2036
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:19,373
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

2037
01:27:19,667 --> 01:27:21,455
Those assholes kind of did it.

2038
01:27:21,535 --> 01:27:22,946
Yeah.

2039
01:27:23,270 --> 01:27:24,943
Those assholes kind of did.

2040
01:27:25,106 --> 01:27:26,293
You may kiss the bride.

2041
01:27:26,373 --> 01:27:27,895
Okay. Kiss the bride.

2042
01:27:27,975 --> 01:27:29,113
Kiss the bride.

2043
01:27:36,452 --> 01:27:37,453
Yeah!

2044
01:27:49,866 --> 01:27:51,487
- You designed this?
- Yeah.

2045
01:27:51,567 --> 01:27:53,956
Insane. We're at a wedding,
it's in the shape of a heart.

2046
01:27:54,036 --> 01:27:55,591
That was a really good idea.

2047
01:27:55,671 --> 01:27:57,207
I have so many good ideas.

2048
01:27:57,473 --> 01:28:00,147
At my last job, I was on fire with ideas.

2049
01:28:00,243 --> 01:28:02,416
Huh? Actually, I need a new partner...

2050
01:28:02,745 --> 01:28:05,954
because Dave is bailing on me
to draw things.

2051
01:28:06,415 --> 01:28:07,917
Would you wanna...

2052
01:28:08,151 --> 01:28:09,596
maybe come work for me?

2053
01:28:09,919 --> 01:28:10,921
Really?

2054
01:28:11,189 --> 01:28:12,600
What do you know about liquor?

2055
01:28:13,057 --> 01:28:15,901
Um, only that it's delicious and I love it.

2056
01:28:16,027 --> 01:28:17,782
And those are
the two things you need to know.

2057
01:28:17,862 --> 01:28:21,139
- You are hired.
- Great. When do I start?

2058
01:28:21,332 --> 01:28:22,572
You can start right away...

2059
01:28:23,034 --> 01:28:25,480
but just know that there will be
some late nights.

2060
01:28:25,570 --> 01:28:27,243
Keep it in your pants, okay?

2061
01:28:27,605 --> 01:28:29,107
If we're going to work together,
let's just...

2062
01:28:29,541 --> 01:28:31,077
keep it professional.

2063
01:28:31,676 --> 01:28:32,746
Okay.

2064
01:28:32,877 --> 01:28:35,133
- We'll keep it professional, then.
- Good.

2065
01:28:35,213 --> 01:28:36,201
- All right.
- Good.

2066
01:28:36,281 --> 01:28:37,302
- Okay.
- Okay.

2067
01:28:37,382 --> 01:28:38,369
- Okay.
- Yeah.

2068
01:28:38,449 --> 01:28:39,928
- Are you sure?
- I don't know.

2069
01:28:41,352 --> 01:28:42,456
What?

2070
01:28:44,088 --> 01:28:45,567
- What'd you say?
- What?

2071
01:28:46,090 --> 01:28:48,263
Love me tender

2072
01:28:48,927 --> 01:28:50,772
Love me sweet

2073
01:28:52,766 --> 01:28:54,177
Never let me go

2074
01:28:58,271 --> 01:29:02,344
You have made my life complete

2075
01:29:06,446 --> 01:29:07,447
I don't.

2076
01:29:10,684 --> 01:29:12,493
Love me tender

2077
01:29:13,353 --> 01:29:14,957
Love me true

2078
01:29:16,990 --> 01:29:19,869
All my dreams fulfilled

2079
01:29:23,830 --> 01:29:27,141
For my darlin' I love you

2080
01:29:27,434 --> 01:29:29,245
Tatiana said this was gonna happen.

2081
01:29:29,504 --> 01:29:30,592
You got my groove back.

2082
01:29:30,672 --> 01:29:31,693
Really?

2083
01:29:31,773 --> 01:29:33,582
That's the sweetest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

2084
01:29:40,582 --> 01:29:41,652
I like you.

2085
01:29:48,824 --> 01:29:50,179
Wait. There's people everywhere.

2086
01:29:50,259 --> 01:29:52,330
- Let them watch.
- Mmm. Okay.

2087
01:29:54,663 --> 01:29:55,698
Whoa!

2088
01:29:56,231 --> 01:29:57,953
Hi, everyone.

2089
01:29:58,033 --> 01:30:00,445
Excuse us. Could we have
your attention, please?

2090
01:30:01,837 --> 01:30:03,959
My husband and I...

2091
01:30:04,039 --> 01:30:07,763
want to thank
four very incredible people...

2092
01:30:07,843 --> 01:30:09,620
for saving the day.

2093
01:30:09,913 --> 01:30:13,292
Mike and Dave have asked
to say a few words...

2094
01:30:13,550 --> 01:30:15,339
so we would like to invite them up.

2095
01:30:15,419 --> 01:30:16,454
Come on, boys.

2096
01:30:18,222 --> 01:30:19,223
Thank you, Jeanie.

2097
01:30:19,857 --> 01:30:22,913
We never got to give our speech
at the rehearsal dinner.

2098
01:30:22,993 --> 01:30:25,371
Because we ruined it. With fights.

2099
01:30:26,196 --> 01:30:27,732
But we just wanted
everybody here to know...

2100
01:30:28,232 --> 01:30:29,734
exactly how we feel about you.

2101
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:31,235
Lights.

2102
01:30:36,106 --> 01:30:38,212
Did you know this was coming?

2103
01:30:48,254 --> 01:30:52,725
You are so beautiful

2104
01:30:53,225 --> 01:30:55,671
So beautiful

2105
01:30:55,995 --> 01:30:56,996
Aww.

2106
01:30:58,931 --> 01:31:00,052
To me

2107
01:31:00,132 --> 01:31:01,236
Aww.

2108
01:31:02,301 --> 01:31:04,056
Can't you see?

2109
01:31:04,136 --> 01:31:05,843
You're so beautiful

2110
01:31:06,238 --> 01:31:07,808
This is real beautiful, man.

2111
01:31:08,107 --> 01:31:12,351
You're everything I hoped for

2112
01:31:12,745 --> 01:31:15,001
- In a little sister!
- Oh!

2113
01:31:15,081 --> 01:31:18,838
You're everything I need

2114
01:31:18,918 --> 01:31:21,990
Everything that I need

2115
01:31:23,055 --> 01:31:24,466
They're kind of good.

2116
01:31:24,557 --> 01:31:26,332
You are so beautiful

2117
01:31:26,961 --> 01:31:28,235
As a couple. Right guys?

2118
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:30,102
Oh!

2119
01:31:30,298 --> 01:31:31,368
To me

2120
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:34,404
And to you.

2121
01:31:34,869 --> 01:31:36,405
And to you. To all of us.

2122
01:31:36,504 --> 01:31:37,983
You're beautiful, Jeanie!

2123
01:31:42,143 --> 01:31:43,622
Dave, everybody.

2124
01:31:44,145 --> 01:31:45,681
He's gonna draw!

2125
01:31:46,013 --> 01:31:47,253
Love you!

2126
01:31:48,549 --> 01:31:49,653
So sweet.

2127
01:31:49,917 --> 01:31:51,539
Thought they were gonna blow it.
They did not.

2128
01:31:51,619 --> 01:31:52,620
That's good.

2129
01:31:52,987 --> 01:31:55,661
This is how we do it

2130
01:31:57,625 --> 01:31:59,298
This is how we do it

2131
01:32:02,330 --> 01:32:04,503
This is how we do it

2132
01:32:04,832 --> 01:32:06,745
This is how we do it

2133
01:32:06,936 --> 01:32:08,358
It's Friday night

2134
01:32:08,438 --> 01:32:09,439
Oh, you don't throw...

2135
01:32:09,539 --> 01:32:10,745
And I feel all right

2136
01:32:11,474 --> 01:32:13,797
The party's here on the west side

2137
01:32:13,877 --> 01:32:16,333
So I reach for my forty and I turn it up

2138
01:32:16,413 --> 01:32:18,620
Designated driver got the keys to my truck

2139
01:32:18,715 --> 01:32:20,854
- Hit the shore 'cause I'm faded
- Faded

2140
01:32:20,950 --> 01:32:21,938
Honey on the streets saying

2141
01:32:22,018 --> 01:32:23,122
Monty, yo, we made it

2142
01:32:23,286 --> 01:32:25,408
I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because

2143
01:32:25,488 --> 01:32:27,331
This is how we do it

2144
01:32:27,424 --> 01:32:29,927
South Central does it like nobody does

2145
01:32:30,160 --> 01:32:31,681
This is how we do it

2146
01:32:31,761 --> 01:32:32,749
All right.

2147
01:32:32,829 --> 01:32:37,041
To all my neighbors, you got much flavor
This is how we do it

2148
01:32:37,267 --> 01:32:40,544
# StangleBenoit2016.

2149
01:32:41,371 --> 01:32:43,248
Hell yeah!

2150
01:32:44,307 --> 01:32:45,583
Oh, God!

2151
01:32:45,977 --> 01:32:47,012
Well...

2152
01:32:48,346 --> 01:32:49,950
I picked a bad pose, guys.

2153
01:32:50,449 --> 01:32:51,484
Fireworks!

2154
01:32:52,551 --> 01:32:54,155
These are for you, Jeanie!

2155
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:57,266
Fireworks close the show!

2156
01:32:59,324 --> 01:33:01,099
Those are from China, those fireworks.

2157
01:33:15,841 --> 01:33:18,151
You idiots! You fucking...

2158
01:33:30,991 --> 01:33:32,479
This is cool.

2159
01:33:32,559 --> 01:33:34,095
I didn't know you could do it this way.

2160
01:33:34,228 --> 01:33:35,571
Oh...

2161
01:33:38,365 --> 01:33:39,420
I'm done.

2162
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:41,155
Fuck. Holy shit.

2163
01:33:41,235 --> 01:33:42,256
Okay.

2164
01:33:42,336 --> 01:33:43,838
That was great. Good job.

2165
01:33:58,151 --> 01:33:59,873
I'm so behind right now
on Game of Thrones.

2166
01:33:59,953 --> 01:34:03,379
I don't even know what's happening
with Khaleesi and her Dothraki boyfriend.

2167
01:34:03,459 --> 01:34:06,303
Okay. Well he's dead, and so is Jon Snow.

2168
01:34:06,395 --> 01:34:07,516
Jon Snow?

2169
01:34:07,596 --> 01:34:09,473
Fuck that dude.
I'm taller than him anyways.

2170
01:34:09,598 --> 01:34:11,077
Saw him.

2171
01:34:11,834 --> 01:34:15,244
I just found out some spelunker
went dunkin' in your bunker.

2172
01:34:16,839 --> 01:34:19,995
You are fresh as a fucking dick
in the morning.

2173
01:34:20,075 --> 01:34:21,564
That's not that fresh.

2174
01:34:21,644 --> 01:34:24,056
Have you ever sucked a dick
in the morning?

2175
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:26,902
I brush my teeth with dick, girl.

2176
01:34:26,982 --> 01:34:29,358
- Alright...
- What?

2177
01:34:29,451 --> 01:34:31,123
Oh. Fox don't like that joke?

2178
01:34:32,721 --> 01:34:34,928
I'm gonna throw up. You look like meat!

2179
01:34:35,024 --> 01:34:36,503
Inner dialogue, inner dialogue.

2180
01:34:36,625 --> 01:34:38,147
I once got lockjaw so bad

2181
01:34:38,227 --> 01:34:39,900
that I was sucking a homeless man's thumb.

2182
01:34:39,995 --> 01:34:41,517
Dave actually had to
come get me from the hospital...

2183
01:34:41,597 --> 01:34:45,389
because they found 13 Pokemon pugs
and a skimmer...

2184
01:34:45,469 --> 01:34:46,846
shoved up my butthole.

2185
01:34:47,038 --> 01:34:49,382
I just had to wait to poop them out.

2186
01:34:50,041 --> 01:34:51,645
Pikachu.

2187
01:34:52,209 --> 01:34:53,415
Pikachu.

2188
01:34:54,078 --> 01:34:55,284
Charmander.

2189
01:34:55,646 --> 01:34:59,525
That's okay. No, no. Keep your dick in.

2190
01:35:01,252 --> 01:35:03,541
For most of my life,
I thought goat cheese...

2191
01:35:03,621 --> 01:35:06,659
was a slang term
for cheese that's gone bad.

2192
01:35:06,757 --> 01:35:10,014
I'd see moldy cheese and I'd be, like,
"Dude, that cheese is goat."

2193
01:35:10,094 --> 01:35:11,903
Like, "Get that goat cheese
off the counter."

2194
01:35:12,129 --> 01:35:14,685
You look like a deconstructed taco.

2195
01:35:14,765 --> 01:35:15,800
Like carnival food.

2196
01:35:15,933 --> 01:35:18,914
Like the waffle that the chef would just go,
"We're throwing that away."

2197
01:35:19,036 --> 01:35:21,043
What are we doing?

2198
01:35:43,396 --> 01:35:46,240
And the home

2199
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:50,872
Of the

2200
01:35:52,805 --> 01:35:55,877
Brave

2201
01:35:58,378 --> 01:35:59,823
Play ball, Mike.

2202
01:36:05,787 --> 01:36:07,909
You know we saw my nigga

2203
01:36:07,989 --> 01:36:10,445
Mike and me forever
It's the Stang life, bitch

2204
01:36:10,525 --> 01:36:13,114
Stang life, getting rich
Selling fucking liquor quick

2205
01:36:13,194 --> 01:36:15,470
Mike and me forever
It's the Stang life, bitch

2206
01:36:15,563 --> 01:36:18,520
Stang life
I will never die I'm a Stangle, bitch

2207
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:21,222
Hunchback of Notre D on the B

2208
01:36:21,302 --> 01:36:24,359
Flying fucking girls
to my sister's wedding at the beach

2209
01:36:24,439 --> 01:36:28,182
Now we in first class seats
Couldn't hold me back, G

2210
01:36:28,643 --> 01:36:33,001
Jeanie Stangie being wild
Sippin' Cristal, sippin', sippin' Cristal

2211
01:36:33,081 --> 01:36:34,169
Sippin', sippin' Cristal

2212
01:36:34,249 --> 01:36:36,058
Jeanie, Jeanie, Jeanie Beanie Weanie

2213
01:36:36,184 --> 01:36:39,174
Gettin' married with Eric
Guaranteed he's got a big, big weenie

2214
01:36:39,254 --> 01:36:42,546
I'm proud of my little sister
Proud that she got a wedding ring

2215
01:36:42,626 --> 01:36:46,083
And a necklace, Eric you're my brother now
So that means I'm kinda black

2216
01:36:46,163 --> 01:36:47,972
Oh, wait. Not really. I'm white, man.

2217
01:36:48,065 --> 01:36:49,720
I'm just happy to be
related to you, honestly.

2218
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:51,021
- Shout out to Eric.
- Eric!

2219
01:36:51,101 --> 01:36:53,423
I be like Superman, let me out the cage

2220
01:36:53,503 --> 01:36:55,726
I got out of my cast
and I flipped the page

2221
01:36:55,806 --> 01:36:58,395
And now I'm drawing comic books
like I used to do

2222
01:36:58,475 --> 01:37:01,898
Kinda cool,
