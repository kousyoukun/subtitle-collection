1
00:00:38,715 --> 00:00:44,501
- Hello? - It's me. Am I bothering
you, Francesco? - Don't worry.

2
00:00:44,551 --> 00:00:49,709
Had to get out of the shower,
sometime. Hold on a minute, Franco.

3
00:01:09,064 --> 00:01:10,854
You were saying, Franco?

4
00:01:10,898 --> 00:01:14,561
Nothing, just calling
to see how you're doing.

5
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:17,145
You know how things are.

6
00:01:20,945 --> 00:01:23,351
Life goes on!

7
00:01:55,753 --> 00:01:57,828
Gnaghi!

8
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:28,307
- Gnaghi! - Gna? - I've been
shouting at you for hours!

9
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:47,356
He's Chigini, the surveyor.

10
00:02:47,404 --> 00:02:51,269
- Twelfth row, third grave, right?
- Gna.

11
00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:05,736
Grave three.

12
00:03:06,247 --> 00:03:10,621
Here we go.
I know you've heard this before.

13
00:03:10,665 --> 00:03:15,906
But this time,
my dear Chigini, it is forever!

14
00:03:17,294 --> 00:03:19,618
Rest in peace.

15
00:03:21,546 --> 00:03:23,917
Oh, my back!

16
00:03:32,426 --> 00:03:35,711
What a waste of good marble!
We'll never fix it.

17
00:03:35,762 --> 00:03:37,753
All this fancy packaging.

18
00:03:37,804 --> 00:03:41,136
I don't know why they don't just
cover the graves with dirt!

19
00:04:30,914 --> 00:04:33,867
The gun!
I forgot the fucking gun!

20
00:04:33,915 --> 00:04:36,950
- Eat!
- Gnaghi!

21
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,707
Give me the spade! Gnaghi,
give me the fucking spade!

22
00:04:42,836 --> 00:04:44,294
Eat!

23
00:04:52,967 --> 00:04:55,124
There we go.

24
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,380
You know the rest, Gnaghi.

25
00:05:00,845 --> 00:05:03,963
My name is Francesco Dellamorte.

26
00:05:04,013 --> 00:05:07,013
Weird name, isn't it?
Francis of Death.

27
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:09,464
Saint Francis of Death.

28
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,804
I've often thought
of having it changed.

29
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:15,053
Andrea Dellamorte
would be nicer, for example.

30
00:05:15,103 --> 00:05:18,434
I'm the watchman
of the Buffalora cemetery.

31
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,518
I don't know
how the epidemic started.

32
00:05:20,564 --> 00:05:24,511
Some people, on the seventh night
after their death,

33
00:05:24,566 --> 00:05:28,608
come back to life:
I call them ''Returners''.

34
00:05:29,026 --> 00:05:32,393
But, frankly, I can't understand
why they're so anxious to return.

35
00:05:32,444 --> 00:05:36,772
The only way to get rid of them once for all
is to split their heads open.

36
00:05:36,822 --> 00:05:40,355
A spade will do it,
but a Dum-Dum bullet is best.

37
00:05:41,032 --> 00:05:44,031
- Come and have a glass of wine.
- Gna!

38
00:05:45,325 --> 00:05:49,866
Is it the beginning of an invasion,
does it happen in all cemeteries?

39
00:05:49,911 --> 00:05:54,488
Or is Buffalora just an exception?
Who knows?

40
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:58,451
And in the end, who cares?
I'm just doing my job!

41
00:06:06,962 --> 00:06:08,954
Good morning, Engineer!

42
00:06:09,005 --> 00:06:12,870
- How are you doing today?
- Fine, Miss Chiaromondo. And you?

43
00:06:12,923 --> 00:06:16,966
- The cemetery is open, isn't it?
- For you, anytime.

44
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:23,802
Oh, hello, cutie! Here.
How are you?

45
00:06:23,845 --> 00:06:27,461
He's happy. He likes it
when the sun shines.

46
00:06:33,349 --> 00:06:35,804
I'm not an engineer!

47
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,848
And you're no cutie!

48
00:06:48,024 --> 00:06:54,059
Poor Gnaghi! On his ID it reads,
''distinctive visible marks: all''.

49
00:06:56,528 --> 00:06:59,361
He has a passion for dead leaves.

50
00:06:59,404 --> 00:07:02,190
Can't stand when the wind
blows them away.

51
00:07:03,573 --> 00:07:07,485
Oh, well. We all do what we can
not to think about life.

52
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,895
Requiescat in pace. Amen.

53
00:08:23,363 --> 00:08:27,275
The most beautiful living woman
I have ever seen!

54
00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:31,024
Will I see her again?

55
00:08:59,631 --> 00:09:03,757
I just came to water the flowers
on your poor father's grave.

56
00:09:05,676 --> 00:09:07,880
Husband.

57
00:09:12,053 --> 00:09:14,259
How long has he been dead?

58
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:22,300
- Two weeks. - Thank goodness.
- What? - I mean, I'm very sorry.

59
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:25,682
- Have you no respect for pain?
- I know how these things are.

60
00:09:25,726 --> 00:09:29,853
- In time, pain heals.
- It's not healing a bit!

61
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:37,971
He was wonderful!
He was a wonderful lover.

62
00:09:38,024 --> 00:09:41,557
Incredible... tireless...

63
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:46,027
He was fantastic!

64
00:10:14,752 --> 00:10:20,834
I messed it all up. I've lost her.
Will I see her again?

65
00:10:25,506 --> 00:10:26,882
BUFFALORA CITY HALL.

66
00:10:30,551 --> 00:10:33,467
Hey, Franco!

67
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:40,712
Franco is the only living person
who even calls me.

68
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:44,843
I stop by his office to remind
myself what he looks like.

69
00:10:44,892 --> 00:10:47,974
You can't live on memories alone.

70
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:56,056
It's for you. Sign as usual.

71
00:10:58,565 --> 00:11:00,687
You got a pen?

72
00:11:00,733 --> 00:11:04,064
- No.
- Hold on a sec. Here we are.

73
00:11:09,153 --> 00:11:12,816
- Did you have any visits
last night? - A couple, yeah.

74
00:11:14,906 --> 00:11:18,605
All this extra work. It's much
if they pay me any more!

75
00:11:18,658 --> 00:11:23,614
- Tell the mayor. - Tell him, then
what? They'd close the cemetery.

76
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:27,822
- Goodbye job and goodbye house.
- Come on, who would believe you?

77
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:31,819
I don't care if you don't believe
me. You're not the one who pays me.

78
00:11:32,123 --> 00:11:34,612
I believe you.

79
00:11:34,665 --> 00:11:37,749
- You're right. At least have him
pay you the overtime. - Good!

80
00:11:37,793 --> 00:11:40,994
- Let's go to the mayor, then.
- It's not that easy.

81
00:11:41,044 --> 00:11:43,712
First you have to fill out
an M3 form.

82
00:11:43,754 --> 00:11:48,129
Report with an M3 form...
Forms.

83
00:11:49,131 --> 00:11:53,957
- I can speed things up for you.
- It's easier just to shoot them.

84
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,086
One M3 form.

85
00:11:58,928 --> 00:12:03,089
- Going to get our willies wet
tonight? - Some of us, yeah.

86
00:12:05,348 --> 00:12:10,091
At a certain point you realise you
know more dead people than living.

87
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,383
Sorry about the other day, I was
a bit crass. I didn't mean to be.

88
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,263
My name's Francesco Dellamorte.

89
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:34,263
This is the only job I could get,
even with a degree in biology!

90
00:13:35,809 --> 00:13:39,391
Anyway, we all end up here
sooner or later, don't we?

91
00:13:39,437 --> 00:13:43,017
I got a great little house.
Want to see it?

92
00:13:43,688 --> 00:13:46,604
I don't live alone,
I've got a helper, Gnaghi.

93
00:13:46,648 --> 00:13:49,269
He's a real conversationist.

94
00:13:51,276 --> 00:13:54,477
The cemetery's small but
it has got a marvellous ossuary.

95
00:13:57,987 --> 00:14:00,228
An ossuary!

96
00:14:13,828 --> 00:14:18,322
I have never seen anything so...
exciting!

97
00:14:18,372 --> 00:14:20,697
Neither have I.

98
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:56,349
- It's like in my dreams!
- This is my dream.

99
00:14:58,434 --> 00:15:02,726
- I couldn't ask for anything
more! - Me neither.

100
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:10,980
You know, you've got
a real nice ossuary.

101
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:13,063
Thanks.

102
00:15:14,359 --> 00:15:18,437
You will allow me to return,
won't you?

103
00:15:18,486 --> 00:15:22,695
- You will allow me to kiss you
just once, won't you? - No.

104
00:15:22,738 --> 00:15:24,646
Not like this.

105
00:15:31,617 --> 00:15:33,443
Like this.

106
00:15:59,881 --> 00:16:01,291
No!

107
00:16:02,383 --> 00:16:05,631
I must be faithful to the memory
of my husband!

108
00:16:06,051 --> 00:16:09,003
I can't! I can't.

109
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:13,549
It's not my fault. It's this place.

110
00:16:15,847 --> 00:16:21,005
I feel strange tremors.
It's not the cold, I'm not afraid.

111
00:16:21,058 --> 00:16:24,970
This place wants me to...
It's forcing me to...

112
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:28,844
I don't want to!

113
00:16:30,437 --> 00:16:32,678
I don't want to!

114
00:16:34,523 --> 00:16:36,811
I can't!

115
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:40,307
I can't!

116
00:16:40,359 --> 00:16:43,359
No! No!

117
00:19:22,524 --> 00:19:25,606
Don't be afraid.
It's just ignis fatuus.

118
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:33,228
Why here?
Why on your poor husband's grave?

119
00:19:33,821 --> 00:19:38,148
I've never kept anything from him.
We trusted each other implicitly.

120
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:41,695
He would have liked to know.

121
00:19:43,408 --> 00:19:46,159
Well, if that's the case...

122
00:19:55,665 --> 00:19:58,699
- These lights!
- Let them watch.

123
00:19:58,749 --> 00:20:01,915
What's better than watching
two lovers making love?

124
00:20:04,794 --> 00:20:07,462
Just to have a bit of privacy.

125
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:21,551
Sorry, the lady wants stars only.

126
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:57,928
It's never been like this before.
With anybody but you.

127
00:21:58,851 --> 00:22:01,139
No-one will ever make us part.

128
00:22:05,854 --> 00:22:07,810
Gnaghi, the gun!

129
00:22:09,273 --> 00:22:13,435
I can explain, listen to me! You
have always been so understanding!

130
00:22:13,816 --> 00:22:15,607
That's life.

131
00:22:37,037 --> 00:22:40,155
It's nothing, my love.
You're fine.

132
00:22:42,748 --> 00:22:46,079
- Great! Just when I don't need it
any more! - Gna...

133
00:22:46,124 --> 00:22:49,705
Don't just stand there,
go call Dr. Vercesi!

134
00:22:50,543 --> 00:22:55,250
Go on, get the doctor!
Go on, move!

135
00:22:56,338 --> 00:23:00,250
Nothing will separate us.
I swear. Nothing!

136
00:23:07,968 --> 00:23:10,838
Nothing will separate us.

137
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,003
Nothing, my love. Nothing!

138
00:23:17,306 --> 00:23:21,302
- Not even Death.
- Not even Death.

139
00:23:59,244 --> 00:24:03,322
Dellamorte? Are you in there?
Dellamorte!

140
00:24:16,461 --> 00:24:18,867
Jesus, you scared me to death!

141
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:22,253
- You're looking for me, chief
Straniero? - Yes, Dr. Vercesi called.

142
00:24:22,298 --> 00:24:25,830
- What happened last night?
- And you know. Why are you asking me? She's dead.

143
00:24:25,882 --> 00:24:29,131
I know she's dead,
but how did that happen?

144
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:32,256
- Her husband.
- Sure!

145
00:24:32,303 --> 00:24:36,132
He came back from the dead, raped
her then beat her to death, right?

146
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:40,258
- No, he didn't rape her. - You
always crack me up, you know?

147
00:24:40,307 --> 00:24:44,467
- Dr. Vercesi, are you spying
on us? - Here's the certificate.

148
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:47,433
Her heart stopped from fear,
it wasn't a bite that killed her.

149
00:24:47,476 --> 00:24:51,554
She died while making...
you know... Doing it.

150
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:54,225
You know what that means, my boy?

151
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:56,808
I'll have to look somewhere else
for the creep who killed her.

152
00:24:56,856 --> 00:24:59,524
- You're no longer a suspect.
- Why not?

153
00:24:59,566 --> 00:25:04,142
You know what I mean.
Don't make me say it.

154
00:25:04,193 --> 00:25:07,395
Go on, you can say it.
I don't mind. I'm impotent!

155
00:25:07,445 --> 00:25:10,693
Don't use that word. A young man
like you, at your age!

156
00:25:10,738 --> 00:25:14,354
- Did she have any relatives?
- No. No relatives, no friends.

157
00:25:16,407 --> 00:25:22,656
Well, I have to say that... Shit!
This is definitely not my style.

158
00:25:23,786 --> 00:25:26,702
- Can I keep her here?
- If you pay for the funeral...

159
00:25:26,746 --> 00:25:28,868
You can do
whatever you want with her.

160
00:25:28,913 --> 00:25:31,486
- Does that wrap it up?
- But a killer's on the lose.

161
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:36,124
The weather's changing, at last!

162
00:25:57,094 --> 00:26:00,426
I can't forgive myself
for having lied to you.

163
00:26:00,471 --> 00:26:03,802
I don't have a degree in biology.

164
00:26:03,847 --> 00:26:06,764
I didn't even finish high school.

165
00:26:09,934 --> 00:26:13,515
I haven't read more than two books
in my whole life.

166
00:26:14,394 --> 00:26:18,722
One... never finished.

167
00:26:21,106 --> 00:26:23,940
The other's the phone book.

168
00:26:43,243 --> 00:26:45,910
I don't want her
to become a Returner.

169
00:26:45,952 --> 00:26:48,821
I don't want to see her again.

170
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:18,130
- No!
- Yes, my love.

171
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:24,085
- Don't make me do it!
- But you do it so well!

172
00:27:24,846 --> 00:27:30,004
- Not to you. - It will be better
with me than with the others.

173
00:28:17,247 --> 00:28:18,741
Gna?

174
00:28:26,502 --> 00:28:28,328
You do it.

175
00:28:29,628 --> 00:28:34,454
Go on! If you finish fast,
I'll buy you an ice cream.

176
00:28:44,469 --> 00:28:46,923
Here comes the Unforgiven!

177
00:28:48,846 --> 00:28:53,305
The man whose dick's so small
he needs tweezers!

178
00:28:54,391 --> 00:28:55,884
Way to go!

179
00:28:55,933 --> 00:29:00,592
- He could become a woman. That'd
solve it! - You can sew it back!

180
00:29:00,643 --> 00:29:03,394
They can stitch it right on
if you've got one to start with.

181
00:29:03,437 --> 00:29:05,559
Forget it, I started that rumour.

182
00:29:05,605 --> 00:29:07,762
The more they laugh,
the further away they seem.

183
00:29:07,814 --> 00:29:10,897
You can never be too different,
Gnaghi.

184
00:29:11,566 --> 00:29:14,814
- Maybe you can.
- Engineer!

185
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:19,273
Engineer! Come, have a seat.

186
00:29:20,154 --> 00:29:25,987
- Well, well. What a surprise.
- It's a miracle to see you here.

187
00:29:26,948 --> 00:29:29,485
It's a miracle seeing you here,
Mr. Mayor.

188
00:29:29,992 --> 00:29:34,568
So, how are things,
down at our cemetery?

189
00:29:34,619 --> 00:29:37,821
How do you think they are?
Population's shrinking.

190
00:29:37,871 --> 00:29:41,202
You are lucky, my dear engineer.

191
00:29:41,247 --> 00:29:44,246
You can't imagine
how things are at the town hall.

192
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:47,990
Now that the elections are upon us,
it is chaos! Right, Inspector?

193
00:29:48,043 --> 00:29:53,496
- Nobody wants to lose their job!
- I was hoping for a New Deal.

194
00:29:53,629 --> 00:29:58,667
- Daddy, what's this?
- This is my assistant, Gnaghi.

195
00:30:04,008 --> 00:30:07,542
He's sweet!
Will you buy him, Daddy?

196
00:30:08,636 --> 00:30:12,133
That's great!
It even knows how to cry.

197
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:15,842
Gnaghi, don't stay so close to her.
Could you move over, darling?

198
00:30:15,889 --> 00:30:18,723
- Would you tell your daughter
to move over? - Of course.

199
00:30:18,766 --> 00:30:22,464
- Sometimes Gnaghi gets a bit
excited. - I'm sure he's fine.

200
00:30:29,313 --> 00:30:34,387
- What's he doing? Dancing?
- No, he's about to...

201
00:30:38,442 --> 00:30:42,224
- What are you doing, Valentina?
- He threw up on me, Claudio!

202
00:30:42,277 --> 00:30:45,858
New fact. Would you like
to go for a ride?

203
00:30:46,196 --> 00:30:48,768
I knew you'd understand.

204
00:30:48,823 --> 00:30:51,110
Take off!

205
00:30:56,034 --> 00:31:00,409
One of these days I have to talk
to you about the cemetery.

206
00:31:01,162 --> 00:31:04,992
The youth of today!
They're so... emotional!

207
00:31:13,584 --> 00:31:17,662
Come on, Gnaghi, get in, for God's
sake! Just get in the car!

208
00:31:17,711 --> 00:31:20,830
It's not the end of the world.
It didn't even bother her!

209
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,330
She understood it was just
a demonstration of your affection.

210
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:27,251
It's not the first time
you threw up over a woman, is it?

211
00:31:30,593 --> 00:31:32,632
Come on, Gnaghi, get in!

212
00:31:34,512 --> 00:31:38,887
Look, first love doesn't count.
It's last love that counts.

213
00:31:47,518 --> 00:31:53,518
Nobody came today. I was a bit
bored. Not even the admiral.

214
00:31:53,563 --> 00:31:58,388
He's just disappeared!
Let's hope tomorrow.

215
00:31:58,441 --> 00:32:05,186
- Come again and stay awhile.
- He was such a distinguished man!

216
00:32:05,569 --> 00:32:11,319
He always used to bring me
a touch of Sambuca!

217
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:49,708
Come on, Gnaghi!
You'll get over it, you'll see.

218
00:32:52,301 --> 00:32:55,999
Time passes,
nothing seems the same.

219
00:32:59,929 --> 00:33:01,802
It just gets worse!

220
00:33:02,473 --> 00:33:06,005
God, is it ever difficult
trying to make you feel better!

221
00:33:07,767 --> 00:33:12,058
What would you do with the Mayor's
daughter? She's only a child!

222
00:33:15,687 --> 00:33:17,845
That's not true.

223
00:33:17,897 --> 00:33:21,346
You're not a child.
You're a year older than I am.

224
00:33:21,732 --> 00:33:23,770
Anyway...

225
00:33:23,941 --> 00:33:29,728
One day you'll settle down with
some poor creature like yourself.

226
00:33:33,488 --> 00:33:38,775
What do you care? They all
end up here sooner or later.

227
00:33:38,823 --> 00:33:40,614
Often sooner than later.

228
00:33:43,117 --> 00:33:45,156
Faster! Open it up!

229
00:33:47,078 --> 00:33:50,409
- If Daddy could see us now!
- He'd kill me.

230
00:33:52,122 --> 00:33:55,370
Claudio! Off we go!

231
00:34:00,709 --> 00:34:04,159
Go! Go!

232
00:34:12,298 --> 00:34:16,341
- Yeah! - Hang on!
- Eat our dust!

233
00:34:33,059 --> 00:34:36,757
Four motorcycles, the Mayor's
daughter was on one of them.

234
00:34:36,811 --> 00:34:40,593
Her head was sliced right off
and had to be sown back.

235
00:34:40,646 --> 00:34:43,811
The bikes crashed into a bus loaded
with scouts

236
00:34:43,855 --> 00:34:46,725
on their way back from church.

237
00:34:46,774 --> 00:34:51,101
Slaughter of the innocents!
And they were all so young.

238
00:34:51,151 --> 00:34:54,814
They felt their life was ahead
of them, but it was passing by!

239
00:34:54,861 --> 00:34:58,727
- Well, you've got your hands full.
- More than you know.

240
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:01,649
Gnaghi, we're going to need
a lot of bullets.

241
00:35:20,499 --> 00:35:25,739
Claudio! Take me with you!
Don't leave me all alone!

242
00:35:25,793 --> 00:35:28,200
Take me with you, my love!

243
00:35:28,253 --> 00:35:32,960
Nasty tart!
My son wasn't with you!

244
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:36,538
- He was promised to the Mayor's
daughter! - But he loved me!

245
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:41,629
- Liar! - He was mine,
he loved me, only me!

246
00:35:41,676 --> 00:35:46,419
- Have you no respect for
a mother? - We're born to die.

247
00:35:47,013 --> 00:35:50,711
Born merely to die!
Do you remember?

248
00:35:50,764 --> 00:35:56,597
Just yesterday, she was alive,
happy. Do you remember?

249
00:35:57,018 --> 00:36:02,389
Dear Gnaghi even threw up on her
and she took it so well!

250
00:36:02,437 --> 00:36:08,389
And now, she's gone.
Right on the eve of the elections!

251
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,012
I'd better get the pickaxe
and shovel.

252
00:36:11,065 --> 00:36:15,939
Pumpkin,
how could you do this to me?

253
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:50,032
Is it true that the dead come back
to life here at night? Tell me!

254
00:36:50,085 --> 00:36:54,295
- Who told you that?
- Is it true or not?

255
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:58,584
- What if it is?
- I've got to see Claudio again!

256
00:36:58,632 --> 00:37:03,587
- I have to know whether he loved
me or her. - I'll let you know.

257
00:37:04,134 --> 00:37:08,627
- No, wait! - Go away!
I haven't got time for the living.

258
00:37:48,697 --> 00:37:49,978
Gnaghi?

259
00:38:35,471 --> 00:38:39,633
Gnaghi! They came back
sooner than we thought!

260
00:38:41,057 --> 00:38:43,013
Gnaghi, wake up!

261
00:39:01,984 --> 00:39:03,774
Gnaghi, watch out!

262
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:12,391
Gnaghi, I'm sorry!
I didn't mean to.

263
00:40:22,191 --> 00:40:27,430
Time's up. I want you upstairs,
ready in 5 minutes, okay?

264
00:41:40,105 --> 00:41:43,057
Oh, no! What's she doing here?

265
00:41:54,778 --> 00:42:00,944
- Visiting hours are over! - No
one'll ever take me away from him!

266
00:42:03,407 --> 00:42:08,198
- Get the fuck over here, quick!
- No, Claudio!

267
00:42:47,847 --> 00:42:51,130
No, Claudio! Take me with you!

268
00:42:53,891 --> 00:42:56,345
Stupid cow!

269
00:42:59,561 --> 00:43:00,935
Come on!

270
00:43:06,188 --> 00:43:08,310
Please, wait!

271
00:43:11,858 --> 00:43:17,727
Claudio, please, take me with you!
Tell me you only love me!

272
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:21,109
Please!

273
00:43:36,829 --> 00:43:38,370
Claudio?

274
00:43:40,247 --> 00:43:42,702
You only love me, right?

275
00:44:08,428 --> 00:44:11,214
Damn! Always shoots
to the right when it's cold.

276
00:44:34,107 --> 00:44:35,814
Gnaghi!

277
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:18,326
No, stop! He's only eating me!

278
00:45:18,421 --> 00:45:23,329
- Move aside. - Mind your business,
I'll be eaten by whoever I please!

279
00:45:23,382 --> 00:45:26,298
This is my business,
they pay me for it.

280
00:45:39,306 --> 00:45:44,132
The living dead and the dying
living are all the same.

281
00:45:44,184 --> 00:45:47,598
Cut from the same cloth.

282
00:45:47,644 --> 00:45:50,809
But disposing of dead people
is a public service.

283
00:45:50,853 --> 00:45:55,727
Whereas you're in trouble if you
kill someone when they're alive.

284
00:46:07,153 --> 00:46:08,563
Wait!

285
00:46:25,705 --> 00:46:27,910
This way they'll be
together forever.

286
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:37,076
I'm sentimental!

287
00:46:57,345 --> 00:47:03,262
Patience, Gnaghi. In love, it's
the waiting that's the best part.

288
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:05,797
You have to learn how to wait.

289
00:48:24,096 --> 00:48:28,840
- What's your name again?
- Gna. - Gnaghi.

290
00:48:33,809 --> 00:48:36,097
I'm Valentina.

291
00:48:36,895 --> 00:48:39,183
Haven't I seen you before?

292
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:46,931
Oh, yeah. Now I remember.
You threw up on me. How sweet!

293
00:48:54,528 --> 00:48:59,864
But I like shy boys.
And you never say no to a kiss.

294
00:48:59,906 --> 00:49:04,447
Take advantage.
I'm in no position to refuse.

295
00:49:04,492 --> 00:49:08,488
Besides, I don't think
I'd refuse anyway.

296
00:50:20,654 --> 00:50:22,610
False alarm!

297
00:50:23,281 --> 00:50:25,438
It was only a cat.

298
00:50:33,828 --> 00:50:36,743
No use you try and help me,
little thing!

299
00:50:37,121 --> 00:50:39,492
If I can't do it, imagine you!

300
00:50:40,123 --> 00:50:43,288
Putting this skull together...

301
00:50:43,332 --> 00:50:46,119
is one of the most difficult things
in the world.

302
00:51:20,851 --> 00:51:24,182
You know, you really are
disgusting when you eat, Gnaghi!

303
00:51:26,479 --> 00:51:31,185
Yes, you're right. It all does get
mixed up in the stomach in the end.

304
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:36,808
What is it?

305
00:52:14,503 --> 00:52:16,245
That wasn't a cat...

306
00:54:01,431 --> 00:54:04,003
We can't! I'm alive...

307
00:54:06,933 --> 00:54:08,511
And you are dead.

308
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:11,512
I'm not prejudiced, my love.

309
00:55:36,853 --> 00:55:39,010
I killed her.

310
00:55:45,608 --> 00:55:47,849
I killed her!

311
00:55:55,321 --> 00:55:57,526
I killed her.

312
00:55:57,572 --> 00:56:02,065
The first time, when her husband
bit her, she wasn't really dead.

313
00:56:02,115 --> 00:56:05,448
When she woke up,
and I shot her, she was alive.

314
00:56:05,493 --> 00:56:10,732
I killed her. I killed
the only woman I ever loved.

315
00:56:10,787 --> 00:56:15,197
I shot her with my eyes closed,
didn't aim for the head.

316
00:56:15,247 --> 00:56:19,741
That's why she came back.
God, what an idiot!

317
00:56:20,917 --> 00:56:26,418
Now I'm infected, too.
Will I be a Returner when I die?

318
00:56:27,212 --> 00:56:29,287
Who knows if Gnaghi...

319
00:56:29,545 --> 00:56:31,703
No, poor Gnaghi!

320
00:56:31,755 --> 00:56:34,790
He'd never have the guts
to crush my skull with a shovel.

321
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:40,501
I'm not dead, you idiot!
A bite can't kill you!

322
00:56:46,262 --> 00:56:49,049
Good morning, Engineer!

323
00:56:49,306 --> 00:56:52,222
Miss Chiaromondo,
I'm not an engineer.

324
00:56:52,265 --> 00:56:56,344
- Are you or not the watchman of
this cemetery? - Of course I am.

325
00:56:56,393 --> 00:56:59,724
You are therefore an engineer.
By the way...

326
00:56:59,769 --> 00:57:05,389
Which of these do you think
would be better on my tombstone?

327
00:57:10,733 --> 00:57:16,484
- Both. - I like the opinion
of a handsome young man!

328
00:57:16,528 --> 00:57:18,769
Goodbye, Engineer!

329
00:57:24,407 --> 00:57:26,647
Good morning, cutie!

330
00:57:44,166 --> 00:57:48,209
But that's the phone book!
Are you crazy?

331
00:57:48,252 --> 00:57:51,453
That is my favourite reading!

332
00:57:52,671 --> 00:57:56,667
We have the new ones but we don't
have to throw the old ones away.

333
00:57:56,715 --> 00:57:58,505
These books are classics!

334
00:58:03,759 --> 00:58:06,510
- Gnaghi!
- Gna!

335
00:58:34,691 --> 00:58:39,814
Stop killing the dead.
They're mine.

336
00:58:39,861 --> 00:58:43,559
If you don't want the dead coming
back to life...

337
00:58:43,613 --> 00:58:48,686
why don't you just kill the living,
shoot them in the head?

338
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:51,526
Are you listening to me?

339
00:59:07,041 --> 00:59:09,613
- Hello?
- This is the Town Hall.

340
00:59:09,667 --> 00:59:12,702
- Franco, how are you? - Bored.
Am I disturbing you?

341
00:59:12,752 --> 00:59:17,875
- No, you never disturb me. - Just
called to talk about the scandal.

342
00:59:17,922 --> 00:59:21,419
- Gnaghi, the door!
- All that crap. What did you say?

343
00:59:23,382 --> 00:59:27,248
- What the hell was that?
- Nothing, I'm just working.

344
00:59:27,301 --> 00:59:31,083
- What?
- You know, daily grind.

345
00:59:31,136 --> 00:59:34,301
You're telling me. Sometimes
I feel like shooting myself.

346
00:59:35,430 --> 00:59:40,089
How's everything in your life?
How are dear Mara and Cinzia?

347
00:59:42,725 --> 00:59:46,388
Sometimes I wonder if they really
exist, Franco.

348
00:59:49,854 --> 00:59:53,186
I mean, you do have a wife
and daughter, don't you?

349
00:59:58,233 --> 01:00:00,473
I only ask 'cause...

350
01:00:00,525 --> 01:00:03,395
sometimes I think
you've made it all up.

351
01:00:11,365 --> 01:00:13,818
Franco, you do make me laugh.

352
01:00:18,409 --> 01:00:20,484
You'll get out one day.

353
01:00:20,536 --> 01:00:26,571
- Buffalora will be nothing but
a bad memory. - Yeah, or maybe not.

354
01:00:26,622 --> 01:00:30,949
If only I could get unstuck.
I feel like a fly on fly paper.

355
01:00:32,166 --> 01:00:35,202
You'll see, Franco.

356
01:00:36,126 --> 01:00:40,418
Mara's going to get tired of you.

357
01:00:41,547 --> 01:00:46,502
And Cinzia will grow up to hate
you. Then you'll be free!

358
01:00:47,799 --> 01:00:51,381
Free to see what the rest
of the world looks like.

359
01:00:52,093 --> 01:00:55,673
What do you think
the rest of the world looks like?

360
01:00:56,262 --> 01:00:59,380
- The rest of the world?
- Uh-uh.

361
01:01:00,806 --> 01:01:04,255
Who knows if the rest
of the world even exists!

362
01:02:03,461 --> 01:02:05,833
At times I get ahead of my work.

363
01:02:07,505 --> 01:02:09,663
Work!

364
01:02:17,802 --> 01:02:19,794
Dellamorte!

365
01:02:23,263 --> 01:02:25,301
Dellamorte!

366
01:02:26,848 --> 01:02:29,089
Gnaghi!

367
01:02:36,187 --> 01:02:38,344
Francesco Dellamorte...

368
01:02:38,396 --> 01:02:42,392
Where were you between
11 and 12:30 last night?

369
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:44,515
In bed.

370
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:47,430
Any witnesses?

371
01:02:51,652 --> 01:02:55,399
I was talking to my friend Franco
on the telephone and I fell asleep.

372
01:02:55,446 --> 01:03:00,734
- What happened? - Some fucking
maniac killed seven people in town.

373
01:03:05,659 --> 01:03:07,402
More work.

374
01:03:08,036 --> 01:03:11,818
Well, you got to go to jail
unless you have an alibi.

375
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:17,207
- Why? - Your car was seen driving
around the streets last night.

376
01:03:18,665 --> 01:03:22,080
- Impossible. No one can drive that
wreck apart from me. - Actually...

377
01:03:22,126 --> 01:03:26,204
I don't think it was you.
I think it was your assistant.

378
01:03:27,295 --> 01:03:31,706
- Gnaghi can't even roller-skate.
- Neither can I, so what?

379
01:03:32,089 --> 01:03:34,376
I want to question him immediately.

380
01:03:45,054 --> 01:03:47,425
God, the weather's gone bad.

381
01:03:59,144 --> 01:04:00,851
Please...

382
01:04:01,479 --> 01:04:05,261
- Let me talk to him first. - Tell
him to come right out, will you?

383
01:04:10,358 --> 01:04:14,436
Don't you ever clean that place?
Jesus Christ, it stinks!

384
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:20,730
When all is sad,
when you're alone, it feels so bad.

385
01:04:20,780 --> 01:04:26,981
You wait again for love to start,
to feel the beating of the heart.

386
01:04:39,289 --> 01:04:41,032
Gnaghi!

387
01:04:41,666 --> 01:04:46,574
I had a terrible dream: I was in
town and killed seven real people.

388
01:04:46,626 --> 01:04:48,867
Hey, remember me?

389
01:04:49,961 --> 01:04:52,451
Dellamorte!
You've got important visitors!

390
01:04:52,504 --> 01:04:58,373
There comes a time when all is sad,
when you're alone, it feels so bad.

391
01:04:58,966 --> 01:05:03,211
You see, Engineer, after this
massacre the voters are furious.

392
01:05:04,635 --> 01:05:07,125
They've been voting for you
for fifteen years.

393
01:05:07,178 --> 01:05:11,469
If we don't find this maniac,
chief, there won't be a sixteenth!

394
01:05:13,432 --> 01:05:15,837
What's your daughter
got to do with it?

395
01:05:15,890 --> 01:05:20,597
The whole town is in mourning.
I'll show them I'm grieving too.

396
01:05:21,144 --> 01:05:24,012
I'll have some pictures taken
of the body

397
01:05:24,061 --> 01:05:26,978
and put a blow-up
on my election posters.

398
01:05:27,021 --> 01:05:32,309
And underneath something like: ''If
you've had a death in the family,

399
01:05:32,357 --> 01:05:36,353
vote for someone
who suffers like you''.

400
01:05:36,401 --> 01:05:40,895
- What do you think?
- Well, you know, it's a thought!

401
01:05:40,945 --> 01:05:48,652
Or: ''Vote for a man who has lost
all other happiness''.

402
01:05:57,995 --> 01:05:59,618
Ready to shoot?

403
01:06:04,623 --> 01:06:07,457
So what do I do?
Take one from the neck down?

404
01:06:07,499 --> 01:06:10,784
Engineer!
What's the meaning of this?

405
01:06:12,502 --> 01:06:19,628
- Daddy! Daddykin! - Did you get
that? - I don't know. It depends.

406
01:06:19,672 --> 01:06:23,620
Daddypie!

407
01:06:24,425 --> 01:06:27,839
Valentina! Pumpkin!

408
01:06:32,012 --> 01:06:36,387
- The plot thickens!
- Pumpkin, where are you?

409
01:06:37,181 --> 01:06:39,338
Where are you?

410
01:06:40,974 --> 01:06:43,132
Your Daddy's here!

411
01:06:43,809 --> 01:06:48,434
- Where are you?
- Stop blabbering and come on in!

412
01:06:53,022 --> 01:06:54,101
Coming.

413
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:01,558
Here I am, little one!

414
01:07:04,111 --> 01:07:07,941
- Jesus, it stinks in here.
- It's my fault, Daddy.

415
01:07:08,988 --> 01:07:11,905
Oh, my God! Valentina!

416
01:07:11,948 --> 01:07:16,443
- What are you doing on TV?
- I'm rotting fast, Daddy.

417
01:07:16,492 --> 01:07:21,199
You, stuttering monster! You're
the one who hurt my little girl!

418
01:07:21,244 --> 01:07:26,616
- No, he loves me! - Step aside.
I command you, as your Mayor!

419
01:07:26,664 --> 01:07:30,245
With your consent,
I'd like to marry Gnaghi.

420
01:07:31,041 --> 01:07:36,412
- This horrible thing? - I'm not
such a great catch either, Daddy.

421
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:41,001
- Not as long as I've got
a breath in my body. - All right.

422
01:07:41,046 --> 01:07:43,417
We'll fix that right away.

423
01:07:58,097 --> 01:08:02,471
- Help me, Engineer!
- I'm not an engineer.

424
01:08:19,565 --> 01:08:21,474
I'm sorry Gnaghi.

425
01:08:21,692 --> 01:08:26,267
She was really beginning
to... go off a bit, wasn't she?

426
01:08:33,155 --> 01:08:35,230
He's dead?

427
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:46,698
- He's dead. Who took a bite out
of his neck? - Not me or Gnaghi.

428
01:08:46,745 --> 01:08:50,077
Take a mould of our teeth.
You'll see they won't match.

429
01:08:50,122 --> 01:08:54,698
- Who did it? - Relax, it won't be
your first unsolved case, will it?

430
01:08:56,125 --> 01:08:57,748
Hold it!

431
01:09:04,004 --> 01:09:06,079
Come on, Gnaghi.

432
01:09:06,463 --> 01:09:10,293
The world's full of girls like
that. And they've got bodies, too!

433
01:09:12,258 --> 01:09:17,463
By the way... Do you know
what my mother's maiden name was?

434
01:09:18,011 --> 01:09:20,679
You'd never believe it
if I told you.

435
01:09:21,221 --> 01:09:25,797
She was called Dellamore.

436
01:09:27,141 --> 01:09:29,926
That means ''Love''.

437
01:09:30,642 --> 01:09:34,258
You're not the only person
in the world who's lost a lover.

438
01:09:50,152 --> 01:09:51,645
Get down!

439
01:09:52,737 --> 01:09:57,029
- What do you think? Get down
from there. - Forget it, Engineer.

440
01:09:57,072 --> 01:10:02,989
- Go home. - You should set a good
example. Get back to your coffin!

441
01:10:03,034 --> 01:10:07,740
You can't stop me.
You owe your job to me.

442
01:10:07,827 --> 01:10:11,241
- Remember?
- Get down or I'll shoot.

443
01:10:11,287 --> 01:10:15,034
You can't. I'm the Mayor!

444
01:10:15,831 --> 01:10:17,241
Ex.

445
01:10:34,674 --> 01:10:39,666
- Mister Dellamorte? - What?
- I'm Civardi, the new Mayor.

446
01:10:40,093 --> 01:10:44,837
- Why the barbed wire? Do they
climb in at night? - No.

447
01:10:44,887 --> 01:10:49,132
- They climb out, sometimes.
- Would you mind coming down?

448
01:10:49,514 --> 01:10:53,213
You reported an epidemic
which affects the dead.

449
01:10:53,266 --> 01:10:57,725
You claim they come to life
within seven days of burial.

450
01:10:58,144 --> 01:11:02,306
- It says so, right here.
- An M3 report.

451
01:11:03,230 --> 01:11:07,439
- Didn't you fill it out? - No.
- Oh, splendid!

452
01:11:07,482 --> 01:11:10,813
So you'll provide us with a denial.

453
01:11:12,817 --> 01:11:14,975
Just sign here.

454
01:11:15,694 --> 01:11:19,275
Franco must have sent it.
What a nice thought!

455
01:11:21,113 --> 01:11:25,323
Nothing happened.
Nothing ever happens.

456
01:11:25,574 --> 01:11:31,610
If the press got hold of the story,
Buffalora'd be a laughing stock...

457
01:11:31,661 --> 01:11:34,067
and you'd lose your job.

458
01:11:35,371 --> 01:11:37,161
My personal secretary.

459
01:11:37,205 --> 01:11:42,445
- Mr. Dellamorte. - A real
pleasure, Mr. Dellamorte. - Thanks.

460
01:11:42,958 --> 01:11:46,905
You and I are going
to get along just fine. Goodbye.

461
01:11:56,297 --> 01:11:59,796
Your name. I didn't get your name!

462
01:12:15,432 --> 01:12:17,804
Will I see her again?

463
01:12:29,815 --> 01:12:31,522
Hi!

464
01:12:33,233 --> 01:12:35,189
God!

465
01:12:35,234 --> 01:12:37,688
I'm sorry.

466
01:12:38,318 --> 01:12:40,987
I didn't mean to frighten you.

467
01:12:41,904 --> 01:12:43,978
I was expecting someone else.

468
01:12:44,864 --> 01:12:47,733
Miss! Miss!

469
01:13:01,955 --> 01:13:06,911
Ever since I got to Buffalora, strange
things have been happening to me.

470
01:13:07,083 --> 01:13:09,703
It's as if I've been here before.

471
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:14,375
And that grave,
and you, Mr. Dellamorte!

472
01:13:14,420 --> 01:13:17,503
It's as if I've known you forever.

473
01:13:18,422 --> 01:13:21,541
It's as if I've loved you forever!

474
01:13:24,717 --> 01:13:27,171
You love me, too?

475
01:13:27,843 --> 01:13:31,092
Why? Who else is there?

476
01:13:34,388 --> 01:13:36,463
I love you as well.

477
01:13:37,474 --> 01:13:41,172
I love you, I love you!

478
01:13:43,809 --> 01:13:48,718
I've heard what they say about you
in town. Is it true that you...

479
01:13:48,770 --> 01:13:51,473
I mean, you can't...

480
01:13:51,521 --> 01:13:57,521
- No, that's town gossip. - Because
I can only love an impotent man.

481
01:13:59,775 --> 01:14:02,396
Yeah, it's true.

482
01:14:02,444 --> 01:14:04,934
I like men...

483
01:14:05,070 --> 01:14:09,445
But their manhood terrifies me...

484
01:14:10,072 --> 01:14:13,819
I can't stand the thought
of them having a...

485
01:14:13,866 --> 01:14:17,233
I mean, you understand...

486
01:14:18,577 --> 01:14:23,450
- It's a sort of phobia I have.
- I don't have one.

487
01:14:23,496 --> 01:14:25,783
I don't have anything at all.

488
01:14:26,039 --> 01:14:28,576
Will you marry me?

489
01:14:58,430 --> 01:15:00,552
I'm getting married.

490
01:15:02,808 --> 01:15:06,849
I'm really getting married. Don't
pretend you didn't hear everything.

491
01:15:07,601 --> 01:15:10,802
Yeah? Why not?
Go ahead, explain...

492
01:15:13,229 --> 01:15:18,387
- God gracious! What are you
saying? - You heard me.

493
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:24,641
My dear boy, you must be very
run down, I'll give you some pills.

494
01:15:25,944 --> 01:15:29,358
Dr. Vercesi, I'm serious.

495
01:15:29,403 --> 01:15:32,853
Look, I'm not going to be
intimidated in my own surgery.

496
01:15:32,905 --> 01:15:37,280
The waiting room is full of people
with honest diseases. - I'll pay.

497
01:15:39,951 --> 01:15:41,859
Yes, I know, but...

498
01:15:42,743 --> 01:15:46,111
How can I?
I mean, everybody knows that...

499
01:15:46,162 --> 01:15:48,320
you haven't got one.

500
01:16:00,128 --> 01:16:03,292
I see. You have got one.

501
01:16:04,504 --> 01:16:08,831
When would you like me
to relieve you of your...

502
01:16:08,881 --> 01:16:10,873
- ..problem?
- Now.

503
01:16:33,310 --> 01:16:36,262
What are you waiting for?
Get on with it!

504
01:16:48,818 --> 01:16:50,477
Now what?

505
01:16:57,072 --> 01:16:59,479
I don't want an anaesthetic.

506
01:16:59,532 --> 01:17:02,566
- It's not an anaesthetic.
- What is it, then?

507
01:17:02,616 --> 01:17:06,612
One shot of this, it'll be
as if you've never had one.

508
01:17:06,660 --> 01:17:09,779
It lasts for over a month.
Look...

509
01:17:09,829 --> 01:17:14,369
Please, don't make me cut it away.
Today I'm just not up to it.

510
01:17:16,582 --> 01:17:18,324
What are you doing?
Turning over?

511
01:17:18,374 --> 01:17:21,707
- I have to give you the shot
in the front. - Front where?

512
01:17:22,001 --> 01:17:25,831
Hold still,
I'll just make a puncture.

513
01:17:53,808 --> 01:17:58,764
That fucking butcher! Must've
given me some kind of infection.

514
01:18:00,354 --> 01:18:05,179
Gnaghi, I'm hovering
between life and death!

515
01:18:06,774 --> 01:18:11,232
Yeah, you're right. I suppose
I'm used to this condition.

516
01:18:14,778 --> 01:18:18,524
That's her, don't let her in.
Tell her I'm not here.

517
01:18:18,571 --> 01:18:21,061
I don't want her
to see me like this.

518
01:18:28,910 --> 01:18:34,328
I must see Mr. Dellamorte. I've got
to speak to him, is he in there?

519
01:18:36,955 --> 01:18:38,614
I'd give my life to be dead!

520
01:18:43,166 --> 01:18:48,621
Gnaghi, it doesn't hurt anymore!
I think I'm better.

521
01:18:53,380 --> 01:18:55,537
When did that happen?

522
01:19:00,467 --> 01:19:05,126
She was our nicest client.
The best always die first!

523
01:19:26,063 --> 01:19:27,770
Where've you been?

524
01:19:27,814 --> 01:19:31,346
I thought I'd go mad. If you only
knew what happened to me!

525
01:19:31,649 --> 01:19:33,854
If you only knew
what happened to me!

526
01:19:34,567 --> 01:19:37,103
I must talk to you.

527
01:19:40,362 --> 01:19:44,855
- We'll always be together.
- Yes, my love, yes.

528
01:19:47,448 --> 01:19:52,653
- I don't know how to say this to
you. But the mayor raped me. - No!

529
01:19:52,701 --> 01:19:57,491
Wait! I liked it.
Not the violence, no.

530
01:19:57,537 --> 01:20:03,786
But after that we did it again
nicely. So that I'd forgive him.

531
01:20:04,124 --> 01:20:07,455
It was wonderful!
Do you understand?

532
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:12,574
This means I'm cured.
I don't have a phobia any more.

533
01:20:13,086 --> 01:20:16,086
I can't marry you, now.

534
01:20:18,047 --> 01:20:23,039
I'm going to marry him. That
doesn't mean anything, though.

535
01:20:23,133 --> 01:20:27,045
Nothing's changed between us.
I still love you.

536
01:20:27,427 --> 01:20:31,469
You know that. I just
love you in a different way.

537
01:20:31,512 --> 01:20:38,507
But you're important to me.
He knows. I mean, about you and me.

538
01:20:38,890 --> 01:20:42,589
He's a wonderful man. He said
he's happy we can be friends.

539
01:20:42,642 --> 01:20:46,970
We can still see each other.
Nothing's changed.

540
01:20:47,270 --> 01:20:50,518
Everything's just as it was.

541
01:20:51,981 --> 01:20:54,933
Everything!

542
01:21:13,074 --> 01:21:16,856
You look for Death
in the clear night,

543
01:21:17,702 --> 01:21:20,950
you tell her you still love her.

544
01:21:21,037 --> 01:21:26,408
That you are her slave,
that she's still your queen.

545
01:21:26,456 --> 01:21:31,163
Death, death, death the whore.

546
01:21:44,048 --> 01:21:46,964
No, I'd only do it for the fear.

547
01:21:47,175 --> 01:21:52,415
I'd come back just to experience
the same fear again.

548
01:21:53,553 --> 01:21:57,844
To be afraid, always to be afraid.

549
01:22:06,559 --> 01:22:07,934
Hi!

550
01:22:09,019 --> 01:22:12,635
Is that white BMW outside yours?

551
01:22:15,563 --> 01:22:19,808
We're on foot.
Could you give us a lift?

552
01:22:20,650 --> 01:22:23,056
It's not very far.

553
01:22:23,442 --> 01:22:25,897
Go on!

554
01:22:27,111 --> 01:22:28,984
I'm Magda.

555
01:22:30,613 --> 01:22:33,612
And this is Laura.

556
01:22:40,785 --> 01:22:42,243
How far is it?

557
01:22:48,330 --> 01:22:51,614
This is where we live.
With another girlfriend.

558
01:22:59,877 --> 01:23:02,747
Do you want to come up
for a drink?

559
01:23:03,379 --> 01:23:07,161
Come on, you're not afraid
of two college girls, are you?

560
01:23:10,675 --> 01:23:14,670
Make a wish. I grant wishes.

561
01:23:16,970 --> 01:23:20,218
I want you to fall in love with me.

562
01:23:25,223 --> 01:23:29,847
But I'm already in love with you.
Haven't you noticed?

563
01:23:36,688 --> 01:23:38,844
It's cold in here!

564
01:23:41,314 --> 01:23:45,013
If you'd like to wash,
there's a sink there.

565
01:24:00,657 --> 01:24:03,776
I didn't mean your face, silly!

566
01:24:04,285 --> 01:24:09,703
I don't know whether I can do it.
I've been taking some medication.

567
01:24:21,126 --> 01:24:24,209
I don't think
your medication is working.

568
01:24:38,926 --> 01:24:40,717
Do you love me?

569
01:24:42,470 --> 01:24:46,548
Yes, if you stay all night.

570
01:24:47,848 --> 01:24:50,598
All my life, too.

571
01:24:55,643 --> 01:24:57,053
Come on!

572
01:24:57,102 --> 01:25:00,552
- Let's rest a bit. - Why?
You've come three times already.

573
01:25:00,604 --> 01:25:03,806
Twice. The third one was faked.

574
01:25:11,818 --> 01:25:17,022
She's sleeping, she's been studying
all day, she's got an exam.

575
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:23,528
- I just wanted to get some wine.
- Sit down, I'll get you some.

576
01:25:40,165 --> 01:25:43,615
Did Laura tell you you can pay me?

577
01:25:43,833 --> 01:25:47,450
- Pay you?
- School's expensive, my friend.

578
01:25:48,961 --> 01:25:52,791
- I have to pay you?
- We don't have a scholarship.

579
01:25:53,838 --> 01:25:56,542
Besides, it's only 100,000 lira.

580
01:25:58,466 --> 01:26:00,837
She told me she loved me.

581
01:26:01,510 --> 01:26:04,081
That's 150,000.

582
01:26:04,594 --> 01:26:08,376
- She wants me to stay the night.
- 200.000.

583
01:26:08,930 --> 01:26:12,842
- Is a cheque all right?
- It's money, isn't it?

584
01:26:14,099 --> 01:26:16,339
Hurry, darling.

585
01:26:17,017 --> 01:26:21,095
I'm cold. Come and warm me up.

586
01:26:23,187 --> 01:26:25,723
I need your warmth.

587
01:26:26,814 --> 01:26:28,852
Warm me up.

588
01:26:29,481 --> 01:26:32,185
Coming, love.

589
01:26:35,901 --> 01:26:38,735
Now you'll be warm forever.

590
01:27:02,456 --> 01:27:08,456
- Help! - This time
I'm really through with love.

591
01:27:30,470 --> 01:27:33,837
I bet you'd like to know where
I was between 1 and 3 last night.

592
01:27:33,972 --> 01:27:37,090
I know, here we are.

593
01:27:37,140 --> 01:27:41,598
I won't tell anyone about this
cheque. That's why I came here.

594
01:27:41,642 --> 01:27:44,512
We're both worldly men, aren't we?

595
01:27:45,602 --> 01:27:50,179
- But that's a proof against...
- Who? We arrested the culprit.

596
01:27:50,230 --> 01:27:54,522
He set fire to the house, got home,
killed his wife and daughter.

597
01:27:54,566 --> 01:27:58,692
Then turned himself in. He's at
the hospital, psychiatric ward.

598
01:28:00,985 --> 01:28:03,356
Somebody's stolen my crimes!

599
01:28:15,451 --> 01:28:16,944
Sir?

600
01:28:17,326 --> 01:28:20,943
- This section's closed.
- I've come to see the killer.

601
01:28:20,995 --> 01:28:23,864
But you can't go in there.
He's in a coma.

602
01:28:23,913 --> 01:28:27,031
- He drank a bottle of iodine.
- I have to take his measurements.

603
01:28:30,375 --> 01:28:32,414
Franco!

604
01:28:36,669 --> 01:28:40,037
You looked a lot better the last
time we talked on the phone.

605
01:29:07,185 --> 01:29:09,093
Thief!

606
01:29:10,436 --> 01:29:12,262
You're a thief!

607
01:29:13,229 --> 01:29:17,011
You may have killed your wife
and daughter, I'll give you that.

608
01:29:17,065 --> 01:29:19,602
But it was me who knocked off
the three girls!

609
01:29:19,649 --> 01:29:22,565
What are you doing,
stealing my murders?

610
01:29:22,609 --> 01:29:25,692
What kind of fucking friend
do you think you are?

611
01:29:25,778 --> 01:29:28,065
I suppose you thought
you were doing me a favour.

612
01:29:28,111 --> 01:29:32,356
- Put that out immediately, smoking
is not allowed in here! - Shut up.

613
01:29:36,991 --> 01:29:39,446
He's in a coma,
he doesn't even notice.

614
01:29:39,493 --> 01:29:41,817
Shit!

615
01:29:41,869 --> 01:29:44,358
What did you say?

616
01:29:52,207 --> 01:30:00,329
Everything's shit. The only thing
that's not shitty is sleep.

617
01:30:00,544 --> 01:30:04,125
- What are you doing on the floor,
sister? - She's praying.

618
01:30:04,171 --> 01:30:06,293
Friend of yours?

619
01:30:06,339 --> 01:30:09,788
He hasn't got any relatives, and
the coma he's in is irreversible.

620
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:13,966
- Give me a signature and I'll pull
the plug now. - Fuck off!

621
01:30:29,351 --> 01:30:32,718
Here you go,
put it back in there.

622
01:30:33,353 --> 01:30:38,391
I won't let you die
until you give me an explanation.

623
01:30:39,189 --> 01:30:42,141
Why did you steal my murders?

624
01:30:43,857 --> 01:30:46,644
Don't you think
anything I do counts?

625
01:30:46,859 --> 01:30:50,807
- Oh, my God! What happened?
- They killed each other.

626
01:30:50,861 --> 01:30:53,067
It was a settling of scores.

627
01:30:53,612 --> 01:30:56,897
- Don't you believe me? - No.
- Tough! - No!

628
01:31:01,783 --> 01:31:03,525
Sorry about that.

629
01:31:07,661 --> 01:31:12,237
So... don't you have anything
to say to your only friend?

630
01:31:17,291 --> 01:31:19,496
Who are you?

631
01:31:19,542 --> 01:31:24,118
I don't know you.
I don't know who you are.

632
01:31:24,169 --> 01:31:30,002
Go away! Go away!

633
01:31:45,388 --> 01:31:48,258
Dellamorte, wait!
For God's sake, wait!

634
01:31:48,307 --> 01:31:51,756
Another maniac's on the loose, he's
on the fourth floor killing people.

635
01:31:51,808 --> 01:31:57,144
He shot three. You've got a gun.
Good, so you can defend yourself.

636
01:31:57,185 --> 01:32:00,803
Take my advice and get the hell
out of here, quick!

637
01:32:02,564 --> 01:32:06,013
Straniero! It was me!

638
01:32:59,467 --> 01:33:02,585
You and I are both the same.

639
01:33:03,344 --> 01:33:06,260
We kill out of indifference.

640
01:33:06,970 --> 01:33:09,591
Out of love, sometimes.

641
01:33:12,224 --> 01:33:14,677
But never out of hate.

642
01:33:20,477 --> 01:33:22,718
Now I don't know
who's dead or alive.

643
01:33:23,646 --> 01:33:26,395
I'm sick of killing.

644
01:33:28,814 --> 01:33:31,435
So I'm leaving the game, brother.

645
01:33:33,484 --> 01:33:40,977
Dellamorte Dellamore bids you
farewell and he's on his way.

646
01:33:42,072 --> 01:33:44,146
Where to?

647
01:33:48,741 --> 01:33:51,029
Better get out of here.

648
01:33:51,326 --> 01:33:54,241
Even the statues are talking.

649
01:33:55,745 --> 01:33:57,950
Where do you think you're going,

650
01:33:57,995 --> 01:34:03,498
if you can't see the difference
between life and me?

651
01:34:16,797 --> 01:34:19,251
Gnaghi, you're not bringing that.

652
01:34:24,217 --> 01:34:27,170
That coffin is not coming with us.

653
01:35:03,778 --> 01:35:06,446
Yeah, I missed that one.
Don't worry, I'll get the next one.

654
01:35:06,488 --> 01:35:10,354
Calm down,
I know every bump on this road!

655
01:35:12,324 --> 01:35:14,233
There's one.

656
01:35:17,410 --> 01:35:19,319
Look!

657
01:35:21,246 --> 01:35:23,700
I've never been this far.

658
01:35:25,414 --> 01:35:27,536
We made it, Gnaghi!

659
01:35:32,126 --> 01:35:33,999
Who could've imagined this?

660
01:35:34,043 --> 01:35:37,624
Wider than all the streets
of Buffalora put together.

661
01:35:37,670 --> 01:35:40,421
It never seems to end.

662
01:35:42,673 --> 01:35:44,830
Hang on, Gnaghi.

663
01:35:45,008 --> 01:35:48,754
Past this tunnel
is the rest of the world!

664
01:35:57,763 --> 01:36:00,598
What do you think the rest
of the world looks like, Gnaghi?

665
01:36:01,307 --> 01:36:03,429
Can you imagine?

666
01:36:07,727 --> 01:36:10,762
You're right.
It's beyond imagination.

667
01:37:04,172 --> 01:37:06,460
I should have known it.

668
01:37:08,799 --> 01:37:11,964
The rest of the world
doesn't exist!

669
01:37:21,972 --> 01:37:23,631
Gnaghi!

670
01:37:24,556 --> 01:37:29,097
Gnaghi, you weren't hit that hard,
come on! I'll take you to the car.

671
01:37:29,142 --> 01:37:31,348
Come on! Why are you going on
like this? Come on, man!

672
01:37:31,393 --> 01:37:34,677
Get up, I'll take you
to the car. Come on, man!

673
01:37:34,728 --> 01:37:36,057
Get up.

674
01:37:36,105 --> 01:37:39,768
What? Gnaghi!

675
01:37:43,024 --> 01:37:44,980
Gnaghi!

676
01:37:45,651 --> 01:37:49,148
Don't leave me alone, now!
Gnaghi!

677
01:37:52,904 --> 01:37:54,445
Oh, God!

678
01:37:55,197 --> 01:37:59,857
Death, Death, Death comes
sweeping down,

679
01:37:59,991 --> 01:38:02,694
fiithy Death,
the leering clown,

680
01:38:02,742 --> 01:38:05,695
Death on wings,
Death by surprise

681
01:38:05,744 --> 01:38:08,529
veiling evil
from worldly eyes.

682
01:38:08,620 --> 01:38:11,786
Death that's born
as Life succumbs,

683
01:38:11,831 --> 01:38:14,746
while Death and Love,
two kindred drums,

684
01:38:14,790 --> 01:38:19,699
beat the time till Judgment Day,
an actor in a Passion Play,

685
01:38:19,751 --> 01:38:24,955
without beginning, without end
evermore, amen.

686
01:38:51,142 --> 01:38:53,632
You're my best friend.

687
01:38:56,519 --> 01:38:59,056
I didn't even realise it.

688
01:39:50,212 --> 01:39:53,745
Could you take me home, please?

689
01:39:57,591 --> 01:39:59,915
Gna.
