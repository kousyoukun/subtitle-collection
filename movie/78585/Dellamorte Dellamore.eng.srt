1
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,650
- Hello?
- It's me.

2
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,480
Oh, am I bothering you, Francesco?

3
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:57,820
No, don't worry, I had to get
out of the shower some time.

4
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:59,490
Hold on a minute, Franco...

5
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,700
You were saying, Franco?

6
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:25,330
No, no, nothing. Just
calling to see how you doing.

7
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,540
You know how things are...

8
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,670
...life goes on.

9
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,100
Gnaghi!

10
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,610
I've been shouting at
you for hours. Gnaghi!

11
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,520
He's Ghigini, the surveyor.

12
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,440
- 12th row, 3rd grave, right?
- Gna.

13
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,130
Grave three.

14
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,180
Here we go.

15
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,810
I know you've heard this before,

16
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,230
but this time,

17
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,440
my dear Ghigini,

18
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:27,730
it is forever.

19
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,440
Rest in peace!

20
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,740
Oh, my back...

21
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,340
What a waste of good marble.

22
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,930
Never looks right when you fix it.

23
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:49,020
All this fancy packaging.

24
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,850
I don' know why they don't
just cover the graves with dirt.

25
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,730
The gun! I forgot the fucking gun!

26
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:48,190
- Ea...t!
- Gnaghi,

27
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:50,450
give me the spade! Gnaghi!

28
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,240
give me the fucking spade!

29
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,600
There we go.

30
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,440
You handle the rest Gnaghi.

31
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,320
My name is Francesco Dellamorte.

32
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,860
Weird name, isn't it?

33
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,330
Francis Of Death.

34
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,910
Saint Francis Of Death.

35
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,330
I often thought of having it changed.

36
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:26,460
Andrea Dellamorte would
be nicer, for example.

37
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:29,380
I'm the watchman of
the Buffalora cemetery,

38
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,010
I don't know how the epidemic started,

39
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,640
All I know is that some people,
on the 7th night after their death

40
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,520
come back to life.

41
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:40,030
I call them "Returners",

42
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:43,990
but frankly I can't understand
why they're so anxious to return.

43
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,370
The only way to get rid
of them once and for all,

44
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:48,290
is to split their heads open.

45
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,710
A spade'll do it, but a
Dum-Dum bullet is best.

46
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,880
Come and have a glass of wine.

47
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:01,100
Is this the beginning of an invasion?
Does it happen in all cemeteries,

48
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:04,020
or is Buffalora just an exception?

49
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:07,900
Who knows? And in the end, who cares?

50
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,700
I'm just doing my job.

51
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,760
Good morning engineer.
How are you doing today?

52
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,180
Fine, Miss Chiaromondo. And you?

53
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,140
The cemetery is open, isn't it?

54
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,230
For you, any time.

55
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,690
Hello cutie. Here...

56
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,110
How are you?

57
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,540
He's happy. He likes
it when the sun shines.

58
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,470
I'm not an engineer...

59
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:51,180
...and you are no cutie.

60
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,660
Poor Gnaghi, on his ID card it reads:

61
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,660
"Distinctive physical marks: all".

62
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,250
He has a real passion for dead leaves,

63
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,170
can't stand it when the
wind blows them away...

64
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,220
Oh well,

65
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:19,770
we all do what we can
not to think about life.

66
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,020
The most beautiful living
woman I have ever seen!

67
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,400
Will I see her again?

68
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:14,870
I just came to water the flowers
on your poor father's grave.

69
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,130
Husband.

70
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,390
How long has he been dead?

71
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,560
Two weeks.

72
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,650
- Thank goodness.
- What?

73
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:35,490
- I mean, I'm very sorry.
- Have you no respect for pain?

74
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,160
Well, you know how these
things are... You see:

75
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:41,040
- in time, pain heals.
- It's not healing a bit.

76
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,590
He was wonderful,

77
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,260
he was a wonderful lover, incredible,

78
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,010
tireless.

79
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,310
He was fantastic!

80
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:27,900
I messed it all up,

81
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:29,450
I've lost her.

82
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:32,660
Will I see her again?

83
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:43,850
Hey, Franco!

84
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,060
Franco is the only living person

85
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,940
who even calls me. Now and
then I stop by his office

86
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,450
to remind myself what he looks like.

87
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,790
You can't live on memories alone.

88
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,880
It's for you. Sign as usual.

89
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:13,390
- Have you got a pen?
- No.

90
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,480
Hold on a sec, here we are.

91
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,530
Have you had any visits last nights?

92
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,240
A couple, yes.

93
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:30,170
All this extra work! It's
much if the pay me any more.

94
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,920
Tell the Mayor...

95
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:35,510
Oh, tell the Mayor then what?
They'd close the cemetery.

96
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:37,470
Good-bye job and
good-bye house!

97
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,850
Come on, who do you
think would believe you?

98
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,940
Listen, I don't care if
you don't believe me Franco,

99
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,730
you're not the one who pays me!

100
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,190
I believe you,

101
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,610
I believe you, and you're right...

102
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,580
- At least have him pay the overtime.
- Good.

103
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,040
Well, let's go to the Mayor, then!

104
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:52,710
It's not that easy.

105
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,630
First you have to fill out an M3 form,

106
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:58,550
report with an M3 form...

107
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,140
Forms...

108
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,220
I could speed things up there for you...

109
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,560
It's easier just to shoot them.

110
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,320
One M3 form!

111
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,070
Going to get our willies wet tonight?

112
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,910
Some of us, yeah.

113
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:19,920
Hell, at a certain point
in life, you realize

114
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,420
you know more dead people than living.

115
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:36,960
Sorry about the other day, I was
a bit crass. I didn't mean to be.

116
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,330
My name's Francesco Dellamorte.

117
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:42,970
You know, this is the
only job I could get

118
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:45,590
even with a degree in biology.

119
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:50,480
Anyway we all end up here
sooner or later, don't we?

120
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:54,150
I've got a great little
house... Want to see it?

121
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:58,320
I don't live alone, I've
got a helper, Gnaghi.

122
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:00,620
He's a real conversationist!

123
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,250
The cemetery's small, but
it's got a marvellous ossuary!

124
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,680
An ossuary...

125
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:28,370
I have never seen anything so...

126
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,370
exciting!

127
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,630
Neither have I.

128
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:06,270
It's like in my dreams!

129
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:08,350
This is my dream.

130
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,820
I couldn't ask for anything more.

131
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:13,650
Me neither.

132
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:22,830
You know, you've got
a real nice ossuary.

133
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,500
Thanks.

134
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:29,090
You will allow me to return, won't you?

135
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:33,140
You will allow me to kiss
you just once, won't you?

136
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,390
No.

137
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,610
Not like this.

138
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,490
Like this.

139
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:16,880
I must be faithful to
the memory of my husband!

140
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,390
I can't. I can't!

141
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:25,430
It's not my fault... It's this place.

142
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:30,150
I feel strange tremors.

143
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,570
It's not the cold...

144
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,820
I'm not afraid...

145
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,830
This place wants me to...
It's forcing me to...

146
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,830
I don't want to!

147
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:43,800
I don't want to!

148
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:49,220
I can't! I can't!

149
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:38,030
Don't be afraid, it's just ignis fatuus.

150
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,420
Why here?

151
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,550
Why on your poor husband's grave?

152
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:48,260
I've never kept anything from him...

153
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,970
We trusted each other implicitly.

154
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,020
He would have liked to know.

155
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,820
Well, if that's the case...

156
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,330
All these lights!

157
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,000
Let them watch.

158
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:14,760
What's better than watching
two lovers making love, hey?

159
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:20,100
Just to have a bit of privacy.

160
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:34,580
Sorry, but the lady wants stars only.

161
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:09,190
It's never been like
this before, with anybody.

162
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,780
Only you.

163
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:13,160
No one will ever make us part.

164
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:20,170
Gnaghi! The gun!

165
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:22,880
I can explain! Listen to me,

166
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:25,890
you've always been so understanding!

167
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,970
That's life!

168
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:51,260
It's nothing my love,

169
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,800
you're fine.

170
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:56,480
Great,

171
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,140
just when I don't need it anymore.

172
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:02,110
Well don't just stand there!
Go call doctor Vercesi!

173
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,780
Go on, get the doctor!

174
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:08,370
Go on! Move!

175
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:10,790
Nothing can separate us.

176
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:13,290
I swear, nothing.

177
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:23,730
Nothing will separate us, will it?

178
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:26,730
Nothing, my love. Nothing.

179
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,990
Not even death?

180
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,870
Not even death.

181
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:16,310
Dellamorte, are you
in there? Dellamorte!

182
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:31,630
Jesus! You scared me to death!

183
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,510
Were you looking for
me, Chief Straniero?

184
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:36,220
Yes, Dr. Vercesi called.
What happened last night?

185
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,600
Well you know. Why are
you asking me? She's dead.

186
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,770
I know she's dead,

187
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:41,430
but how did that happen?

188
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,020
Her husband.

189
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,070
Sure! He came back from
the dead, he raped her,

190
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,740
then bit her to death.
Is that what he did?

191
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,410
No, he didn't rape her.

192
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:53,120
Oh, you always crack me up, you know!

193
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,210
Dr. Vercesi, are you spying on us?

194
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:56,960
No, I dropped this certificate.

195
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,220
Her heart stopped from fear, it
wasn't the bite that killed her.

196
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:04,390
She died while making...
well you know... doing it.

197
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,100
You know what that means, my boy?

198
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:09,600
I'll have to look somewhere else
for the creep who killed her!

199
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:12,110
- You are no longer a suspect.
- Why not?

200
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,910
Well, you know what I mean.

201
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,910
Look, don't make me say it!

202
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,160
Go on, you can say it. I
don't mind, I'm impotent!

203
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,380
Don't use that word! A young
man like you, at your age...

204
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,210
Did she have any relatives?

205
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,720
No, no relatives, no friends.

206
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:31,020
Well, I have to say that...

207
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:33,100
Shit! This is definitely not my style!

208
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:39,530
- Can I keep her here?
- If you pay for the funeral, of course

209
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:41,320
you can do whatever
the hell you want with her.

210
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:43,700
- Does that wrap it up, then?
- Yeah, except for a killer on the loose.

211
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:45,790
Care to join me for a cup of tea?

212
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:49,790
The weather's changing at last!

213
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:12,080
I can't forgive myself
for having lied to you:

214
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:15,540
I don't have a degree in biology,

215
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:18,760
I didn't even finish high school.

216
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,980
I haven't read more than
two books in my whole life:

217
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,900
one,

218
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,610
never finished,

219
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,990
and the other is the phone book.

220
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:58,400
I don't want her to become a Returner.

221
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:01,160
I don't want to see her again.

222
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:28,870
No!

223
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:31,080
Yes, my love!

224
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,710
No, don't make me do it!

225
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,300
But if you do it so well... so well!

226
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:39,010
Not to you!

227
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,930
It will be better with
me than with the others!

228
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,300
Gna!

229
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:40,990
You do it!

230
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:46,410
Well go on! If you finish
fast I'll buy you an ice-cream.

231
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:47,580
Gna!

232
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:59,350
- Here comes the Unforgiven.
- Who?

233
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:01,100
The Tombstone Mayor.

234
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:05,610
The man whose dick's so
small he pees with tweezers.

235
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,620
He could become a
woman. That'd solve it!

236
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,750
They are sewing them
back on in the States now.

237
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,250
Yeah, they can stitch it right on,
if you've got one to start with.

238
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,210
Forget it, I started that rumour.

239
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,300
The more they laugh, the
further away they seem.

240
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:22,800
You can never be too different, Gnaghi.

241
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:25,970
Maybe you can.

242
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,810
Engineer!

243
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:32,940
Engineer, engineer, come! Have a seat!

244
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:36,160
Well well well, what a surprise!

245
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:40,040
Yes! It's a miracle
seeing you here, engineer!

246
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,750
It's a miracle seeing
you here, Mr. Mayor.

247
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:47,340
So, how are things down at
our cemetery? How are things?

248
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,010
Well how do you think things are?

249
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,350
Population's shrinking.

250
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:53,520
You're lucky, my dear engineer!

251
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,860
You just can't imagine how
things are at the Town Hall.

252
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,690
Now that the elections are upon us,

253
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:01,530
it is chaos, right, inspector?

254
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:04,660
Yeah, it's a thrill for all,
nobody wants to lose their job.

255
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,540
I was hoping for a New Deal...

256
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,960
Daddy, what's this?

257
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,630
This is my assistant Gnaghi.

258
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,430
He's sweet!

259
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,390
Will you buy him, daddy?

260
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:25,230
That's great, it even knows how to cry!

261
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,070
Gnaghi, don't stay so close to her.

262
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,990
Could you move over, darling?

263
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,950
Would you tell your
daughter to move over please?

264
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:32,080
Yes of course.

265
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,870
Sometimes Gnaghi gets a little bit excited...

266
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,250
Oh, I'm sure he's
charming. Now, where was I?

267
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:44,850
What's he doing? Dancing?

268
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:47,440
No, no, he's just about to...

269
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:52,950
What the hell are you doing Valentina?

270
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,280
He threw up on me, Claudio!

271
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,700
Oh, a new fact!

272
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,710
Would you like to go for a ride?

273
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,420
I knew you'd understand!

274
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,500
Take off!

275
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,020
By the way, one of these days

276
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:13,100
I have to talk to you
about the cemetery.

277
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:18,740
The youth of today...
They're so... emotional.

278
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,750
Come on, Gnaghi! Get in, for God's sake!

279
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,170
Don't do this, just get in the car!

280
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:34,260
It's not the end of the world,
It didn't even bother her!

281
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:36,890
She understood it was just a
demonstration of your affection.

282
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:40,860
Anyway, it's not the first time
you threw up over a woman, is it?

283
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:45,950
Come on, Gnaghi, get in!

284
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:50,540
Look, first love doesn't count.

285
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,750
It's last love that counts!

286
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:03,390
Nobody came today.

287
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,270
I was a bit bored,

288
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:08,900
not even the admiral...
he's just disappeared!

289
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:11,740
Let's hope tomorrow, okay?

290
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:14,330
Yeah, come again and stay a while.

291
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:19,040
Oh, he was such a
distinguished man, the admiral!

292
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:22,510
Always used to bring me, always,

293
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:25,720
a touch of Sambuca.

294
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:00,650
Oh, come on Gnaghi!

295
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:02,740
You'll get over, you'll see!

296
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:07,660
Time passes,

297
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,330
nothing seems the same...

298
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:15,260
It just gets worse.

299
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:18,590
God, is it ever difficult
trying to make you feel better!

300
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,770
What were you doing with the Mayor's
daughter anyway? She's only a child!

301
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:26,650
Gna!

302
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:32,490
Oh yeah, that's not true,
you are not a child, Gnaghi.

303
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:35,960
You're a year older than I am. Anyway...

304
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:38,540
One day,

305
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,630
you'll settle down with some...

306
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:43,220
poor creature like yourself.

307
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:48,640
In the meanwhile, why do you care?

308
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:51,900
They all end up here
sooner or later, Gnaghi.

309
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,740
Often sooner than later.

310
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:58,790
Faster, open it up!

311
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:03,250
- If daddy could see us now!
- He'd kill me!

312
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,010
Claudio!

313
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:09,010
- Off we go!
- Go!

314
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,770
Go! Go!

315
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:17,980
Go!

316
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:29,790
- Hang on!
- Eat our dust!

317
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,450
Four motorcycles racing...

318
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:49,990
The Mayor's daughter is on one of them.

319
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:52,080
Her head was sliced right off.

320
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,870
They had to sew it back on the body.

321
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,090
The bikes crashed into
a bus loaded with scouts

322
00:34:57,210 --> 00:35:00,260
on their way back from
a church-sponsored rally.

323
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:02,090
Slaughter of the innocents!

324
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:04,180
And they were all so young.

325
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:08,480
They felt their life was ahead of them,
but in fact they were already passing by.

326
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:10,360
Well, you've got your hands full!

327
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,110
Oh, more than you know!

328
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:15,280
Gnaghi, we're going to
need a lot of bullets.

329
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:23,500
# Never should have gone
out on the Boy Scout picnic,

330
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:27,130
# never should have, never
should have gone just then.

331
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:30,600
# Never should have gone
out on the Boy Scout picnic,

332
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,650
# Never should have, now
I'll never go again! #

333
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:36,440
Claudio! Take me with you!

334
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:39,360
Don't leave me all alone, Claudio!

335
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,320
Take me with you, my love!

336
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:43,660
Nasty tart!

337
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,580
My son wasn't with you!

338
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,840
He was promised to the Mayor's daughter!

339
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:51,470
- But he loved me!
- Liar!

340
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:54,090
He was mine, he loved me!

341
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:57,520
- Only me!
- Have you no respect for a mother's pain?

342
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,020
We're born to die,

343
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,610
born merely to die.

344
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:04,530
Do you remember?

345
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:06,070
Just yesterday,

346
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,700
she was alive, happy.

347
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,540
Do you remember?

348
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:13,580
Dear Gnaghi even threw up on her,

349
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:15,670
and she took it so well!

350
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:19,010
And now, she's gone...

351
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:22,050
and right on the eve of the elections!

352
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,560
I better get the pickaxe and shovel.

353
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:28,730
Pumpkin, how could you do this to me?

354
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:02,540
Is it true as they say, that the
dead come back to life here at night?

355
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,870
Tell me the truth!

356
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,210
Hey! Who told you that?

357
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:08,380
Is it true or not? Is it true or not?

358
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:09,840
What if it is?

359
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:12,640
I've got to see Claudio again!

360
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,140
I have to know whether
he loved me or her!

361
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:17,140
If I hear anything, I'll let you know.

362
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:19,940
No, wait...

363
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,740
Go away! I haven't got
time for the living!

364
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,970
Gnaghi?

365
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:50,380
Gnaghi!

366
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,920
Gnaghi, they came back
sooner than we thought!

367
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,640
Gnaghi wake up!

368
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:17,630
Gnaghi, watch out!

369
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:22,520
Gnaghi,

370
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:26,360
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

371
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:38,050
Well, that's it, time's up and

372
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:41,640
I want you upstairs and
ready in five minutes! Okay?

373
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:56,420
Oh no, what's she doing here?

374
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:10,950
Visiting hours are over!

375
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:13,330
No one is going to
take me away from him!

376
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,420
Quick, get the fuck over here! Quick!

377
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:21,460
No, Claudio!

378
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:07,040
Claudio, take me with
you! Don't leave me!

379
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:09,540
Stupid cow!

380
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:14,760
Come on!

381
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:21,980
Wait! Wait!

382
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:28,650
Claudio please, take me with you!

383
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:31,700
Tell me you only love me!

384
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:34,410
Please...

385
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:52,110
Claudio!

386
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,820
You only love me, right?

387
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:25,830
Damn! It always shoots to
the right when it's cold.

388
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:49,280
Gnaghi!

389
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:32,100
No, please don't! He's only eating me!

390
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:33,440
Move aside.

391
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:37,280
Mind your business! I shall
be eaten by whoever I please!

392
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,120
This is my business. They pay me for it.

393
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:55,060
The living dead

394
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:58,480
and the dying living are all the same.

395
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,980
Cut from the same cloth.

396
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:04,820
But disposing of dead
people is a public service,

397
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:07,320
whereas you're in all sorts of trouble

398
00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:10,580
if you kill someone
while they're still alive.

399
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:22,270
Wait!

400
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,090
This way they'll be together forever.

401
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:51,060
I'm sentimental.

402
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,510
Patience, Gnaghi.

403
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,100
In love, it's the waiting
that's the best part.

404
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:19,770
You have to learn how to wait.

405
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:41,450
- What's your name again?
- Gna!

406
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:43,320
Gnaghi.

407
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:50,420
I'm Valentina.

408
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:53,550
Haven't I seen you before?

409
00:48:55,010 --> 00:48:58,140
Oh yeah. Now I remember.

410
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:00,640
You threw up on me. How sweet!

411
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,280
But I like shy boys.

412
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:14,290
And you never say no to a kiss.

413
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:15,460
Take advantage.

414
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:19,550
I'm certainly in no position
to refuse. Besides,

415
00:49:19,970 --> 00:49:21,390
I don't think I'd refuse anyway.

416
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,420
False alarm!

417
00:50:37,590 --> 00:50:39,430
It was only a cat.

418
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:51,030
No use you trying
to help me, little thing!

419
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:53,950
If I can't do it, imagine you...

420
00:50:54,370 --> 00:50:57,080
Putting this skull together,

421
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:00,540
is one of the most difficult
things in the world.

422
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:37,980
You know, you really are
disgusting when you eat, Gnaghi.

423
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:42,570
Yes, you're right. I suppose it all does
get mixed up in the stomach, in the end.

424
00:51:46,030 --> 00:51:47,370
What is it?

425
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:27,930
That wasn't a cat!

426
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:15,600
We can't! I'm alive,

427
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:19,280
and you are dead.

428
00:54:20,030 --> 00:54:22,700
I'm not prejudiced, my love.

429
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:49,760
I killed her!

430
00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:52,760
Gna!

431
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:59,020
I killed her!

432
00:56:07,370 --> 00:56:08,830
I killed her.

433
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:13,710
The first time, when her husband
bit her, she wasn't really dead.

434
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:16,130
When she woke up, and I
shot her, she was alive.

435
00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:18,970
I killed her.

436
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:22,600
I killed the only woman I ever loved.

437
00:56:22,810 --> 00:56:24,980
I shot her with my eyes closed,

438
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:26,900
didn't aim for the head.

439
00:56:27,070 --> 00:56:28,990
That's why she came back.

440
00:56:29,490 --> 00:56:31,660
God, what an idiot!

441
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:35,000
Now, I'm infected too.

442
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:37,830
Will I be a Returner when I die?

443
00:56:38,750 --> 00:56:41,250
Who knows if Gnaghi...

444
00:56:41,510 --> 00:56:44,720
No, poor Gnaghi, he'd
never have the guts

445
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,810
to crush my skull with a shovel.

446
00:56:48,890 --> 00:56:52,770
I'm not dead, you idiot!
A bite can't kill you!

447
00:56:58,370 --> 00:57:00,790
Good morning, engineer!

448
00:57:01,410 --> 00:57:03,790
Miss Chiaromondo, I'm not an engineer.

449
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:07,130
Are you, or are you not
the watchman of the cemetery?

450
00:57:07,210 --> 00:57:08,800
Well, of course I am.

451
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:12,060
You are therefore an engineer. By the way,

452
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:17,270
which of these do you think
would be better on my tombstone?

453
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:24,070
Both.

454
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:28,410
I like the opinion of
a handsome young man.

455
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:30,420
Good-bye, engineer.

456
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:38,850
- Gna!
- Good morning, cutie.

457
00:57:55,870 --> 00:57:57,880
But that's the phone book.

458
00:57:58,050 --> 00:57:59,720
Are you crazy?

459
00:58:00,130 --> 00:58:02,640
That is my favourite reading!

460
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,640
Gnaghi, just because
we've got the new ones

461
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:10,690
doesn't mean to say we have to throw the
old ones away. These books are classics!

462
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:17,240
Gnaghi!

463
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:18,830
Gna!

464
00:58:46,870 --> 00:58:49,790
Stop killing the dead.

465
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:51,800
They're mine.

466
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:55,220
If you don't want the
dead coming back to life...

467
00:58:55,550 --> 00:58:58,680
why don't you just kill the living,

468
00:58:58,890 --> 00:59:00,060
shoot them in the head?

469
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:02,860
Are you listening to me?

470
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:21,510
- Hello?
- Greetings from the Tomb oft the Town Hall.

471
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:23,310
- Franco! How are you?
- Bored.

472
00:59:23,430 --> 00:59:25,180
Am I disturbing you?

473
00:59:25,390 --> 00:59:26,940
No, you never disturb me.

474
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:29,780
Just called to talk about the scandal.

475
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:31,940
- Gnaghi, the door!
- All that crap.

476
00:59:32,030 --> 00:59:33,110
What did you say?

477
00:59:35,620 --> 00:59:37,290
What the hell was that?

478
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:38,540
Nothing, I'm...

479
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:40,000
- ...just working.
- What?

480
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:43,040
You know, daily grind.
Nothing but the daily grind.

481
00:59:43,050 --> 00:59:45,630
You're telling me! Sometimes,
I feel like shooting myself.

482
00:59:47,810 --> 00:59:49,600
How's everything in your life?

483
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:51,810
How are dear Mara and Cinzia?

484
00:59:54,730 --> 00:59:57,950
You know, sometimes I wonder
if they really exist, Franco.

485
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:05,460
I mean, you do have a wife
and a daughter, don't you?

486
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:15,470
I only ask 'cause... sometimes
I think you've made it all up.

487
01:00:23,530 --> 01:00:26,120
Franco, you do make me laugh!

488
01:00:30,790 --> 01:00:32,710
You'll get out one day.

489
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:37,880
Buffalora will be
nothing but a bad, bad memory.

490
01:00:38,130 --> 01:00:41,140
Yeah, or maybe not, if
only I could get unstuck...

491
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:43,850
I feel like a fly on fly paper.

492
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,230
You'll see, Franco...

493
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:52,740
Mara is going to get tired of you,

494
01:00:53,990 --> 01:00:56,910
and Cinzia will grow up to hate you.

495
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,880
Then you'll be free.

496
01:01:00,130 --> 01:01:03,470
Free to see what the rest
of the world looks like.

497
01:01:04,430 --> 01:01:07,640
What do you think the rest
of the world looks like?

498
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:10,440
- The rest of the world?
- Uh-uh.

499
01:01:13,070 --> 01:01:16,700
Who knows if the rest of
the world even exists...

500
01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:30,050
Look who it is!

501
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:31,720
Hey, Dellamorte, come here!

502
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:18,800
At times, I get ahead of my work.

503
01:02:19,710 --> 01:02:21,300
Work!

504
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:31,730
Dellamorte!

505
01:02:35,570 --> 01:02:37,490
Dellamorte!

506
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:40,830
Gnaghi!

507
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:50,850
Francesco Dellamorte?

508
01:02:50,930 --> 01:02:54,480
Where were you between
11 and 12:30 last night?

509
01:02:54,770 --> 01:02:56,270
In bed.

510
01:02:56,980 --> 01:02:58,860
Any witnesses?

511
01:03:03,950 --> 01:03:07,960
I was talking to my friend Franco
on the telephone and I fell asleep.

512
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:09,710
Why, what happened?

513
01:03:09,790 --> 01:03:12,630
Some fucking maniac
killed 7 people in town.

514
01:03:18,270 --> 01:03:20,060
More work.

515
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:23,900
Well, you got to go to jail,
unless you have an alibi!

516
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:25,480
Why me?

517
01:03:25,650 --> 01:03:30,160
Because your car was seen driving
around the streets last night, that's why.

518
01:03:31,330 --> 01:03:33,920
That's impossible, no one
can drive that wreck apart from me.

519
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,920
Actually, I don't think it was you.

520
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:39,130
I think it was your assistant.

521
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:42,180
Gnaghi can't even roller-skate!

522
01:03:42,350 --> 01:03:44,270
Neither can I, so what?

523
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:47,060
I want to question him immediately.

524
01:03:57,370 --> 01:04:00,000
God, the weather's gone bad.

525
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:13,140
Please,

526
01:04:13,770 --> 01:04:14,900
let me talk to him first.

527
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:18,070
Just tell him to come
right out, will you?

528
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:27,000
Don't you ever clean that
place? Jesus Christ, it stinks!

529
01:04:28,670 --> 01:04:33,180
# When all is sad, when you're
alone, it feels so bad.

530
01:04:33,220 --> 01:04:39,520
# You wait again for love to start,
to feel the beating of the heart. #

531
01:04:51,620 --> 01:04:53,710
Gnaghi!

532
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:56,630
Gnaghi, I had a terrible dream last night,

533
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:59,890
I dreamt I went to town
and killed 7 real people.

534
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:02,310
Hi, remember me?

535
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:05,810
Dellamorte, you've
got important visitors!

536
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:14,280
You'll understand, engineer, after this massacre,

537
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:15,950
the voters are furious with me.

538
01:05:17,210 --> 01:05:19,500
They've been voting
for you for 15 years.

539
01:05:19,710 --> 01:05:22,010
If I don't find this maniac, Straniero,

540
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:24,170
there won't be a sixteenth.

541
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:28,180
What's your daughter got to do with it?

542
01:05:28,180 --> 01:05:30,270
Now that the whole town is in mourning,

543
01:05:30,350 --> 01:05:33,690
I want to show them
that I'm grieving as well.

544
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:36,530
I'll have some pictures
taken of the body

545
01:05:36,610 --> 01:05:39,450
and put a blow-up on
my election posters.

546
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:41,620
And underneath, something like:

547
01:05:41,950 --> 01:05:44,750
"if you've had a death in the family,

548
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:48,920
vote for someone who suffers like you."

549
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:50,470
What do you think?

550
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:53,510
Well, you know, it's a thought!

551
01:05:53,810 --> 01:05:56,020
Or: "Vote

552
01:05:56,230 --> 01:05:58,520
for a man who has lost

553
01:05:58,730 --> 01:06:01,990
all other happiness."

554
01:06:10,330 --> 01:06:12,500
Ready to shoot?

555
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:19,680
So what do I do? Take
one from the neck down?

556
01:06:19,930 --> 01:06:21,480
Engineer?

557
01:06:21,770 --> 01:06:23,770
What's the meaning of this?

558
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,190
Daddy!

559
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:28,990
Daddykin!

560
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:30,240
Did you hear that?

561
01:06:30,450 --> 01:06:32,330
I don't know. It depends...

562
01:06:32,450 --> 01:06:34,290
Daddypie!

563
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:36,710
Daddypooh!

564
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:38,590
Valentina!

565
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:40,550
Pumpkin!

566
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:46,220
The plot thickens!

567
01:06:46,310 --> 01:06:48,890
Pumpkin, where are you?

568
01:06:49,980 --> 01:06:51,730
Where are you?

569
01:06:53,610 --> 01:06:55,570
Your Daddy's here!

570
01:06:56,530 --> 01:06:58,080
Where are you?

571
01:06:58,330 --> 01:07:00,910
Stop blabbering and come on in!

572
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:07,380
Coming.

573
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:14,190
Here I am, little one.

574
01:07:16,980 --> 01:07:18,650
Jesus, it stinks in here!

575
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:19,900
It's my fault, daddy!

576
01:07:21,990 --> 01:07:23,950
Oh my God, Valentina!

577
01:07:24,370 --> 01:07:26,580
What are you doing on TV?

578
01:07:26,620 --> 01:07:28,870
I'm rotting fast, Daddy!

579
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:31,590
You, stuttering monster,

580
01:07:31,710 --> 01:07:33,670
you're the one who hurt my little girl!

581
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:35,760
No, he loves me!

582
01:07:35,970 --> 01:07:37,550
Step aside!

583
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:39,230
I command you, as your Mayor!

584
01:07:39,310 --> 01:07:42,150
With your consent, I'd
like to marry Gnaghi.

585
01:07:43,820 --> 01:07:45,780
- This horrible thing?
- Gna!

586
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,700
I'm not such a great
catch either, Daddy.

587
01:07:48,990 --> 01:07:51,910
Not as long, dear, as I've
got a breath in my body!

588
01:07:52,450 --> 01:07:55,580
Alright. We'll fix that right away!

589
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:13,450
Help me, engineer!

590
01:08:13,530 --> 01:08:15,620
I'm not an engineer!

591
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:34,060
I'm sorry Gnaghi,

592
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:36,400
she really was beginning to...

593
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:38,900
go off a bit on that, wasn't she?

594
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:46,830
He's dead?

595
01:08:54,090 --> 01:08:55,260
He's dead.

596
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:57,680
Who took a bite out of his neck?

597
01:08:57,770 --> 01:08:59,350
Well, not me or Gnaghi,

598
01:08:59,350 --> 01:09:01,320
Take a mould of our teeth.

599
01:09:01,610 --> 01:09:02,980
You'll see they won't match.

600
01:09:03,190 --> 01:09:04,030
And who did it?

601
01:09:04,230 --> 01:09:07,450
Oh, relax Straniero. This won't be
your first unsolved case, will it?

602
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:10,290
Hold it!

603
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:18,630
Oh, come on, Gnaghi...

604
01:09:19,130 --> 01:09:22,470
The world's full of girls like
that, and they've got bodies, too.

605
01:09:25,310 --> 01:09:26,770
By the way,

606
01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:29,820
do you know what my
mother's maiden name was?

607
01:09:31,070 --> 01:09:33,160
You'd never believe it if I told you.

608
01:09:33,870 --> 01:09:36,580
She was called Dellamore.

609
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:38,750
Dellamore.

610
01:09:39,830 --> 01:09:41,920
That means "love"...

611
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:47,350
You're not the only person in the
world who's lost a lover, Gnaghi.

612
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:04,460
Get down!

613
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:07,250
What do you think? Get down from there!

614
01:10:07,380 --> 01:10:09,550
Forget it, engineer!

615
01:10:10,170 --> 01:10:11,840
Go home!

616
01:10:11,970 --> 01:10:13,510
You're supposed to be
setting a good example,

617
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:16,140
now will you get back to
your coffin immediately!

618
01:10:16,230 --> 01:10:18,230
You can't stop me,

619
01:10:18,310 --> 01:10:20,820
you owe your job to me.

620
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:24,160
- Remember?
- Get down or I'll shoot.

621
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:25,820
You can't.

622
01:10:26,030 --> 01:10:28,240
I'm the Mayor!

623
01:10:28,540 --> 01:10:30,080
Ex!

624
01:10:47,860 --> 01:10:50,240
- Mr. Dellamorte?
- What?

625
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:52,320
I'm Civardi, the new Mayor.

626
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:54,950
Why the barbed wire?

627
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:56,620
Do they climb in at night?

628
01:10:56,790 --> 01:10:59,210
No, they climb out, sometimes.

629
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:01,800
Would you mind coming down?

630
01:11:02,630 --> 01:11:05,680
You reported an epidemic
which affects the dead.

631
01:11:06,390 --> 01:11:08,480
You claim they come to life

632
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:10,810
within seven days of burial.

633
01:11:11,110 --> 01:11:15,700
- It says so, right here.
- An M3 report.

634
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:17,910
- Didn’t you fill it out?
- No.

635
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:20,700
Oh, splendid.

636
01:11:20,830 --> 01:11:23,750
So you'll provide us with a denial.

637
01:11:26,130 --> 01:11:28,010
Just sign here.

638
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:30,600
Franco must have sent it.

639
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:32,390
What a nice thought.

640
01:11:34,270 --> 01:11:36,150
Nothing happened.

641
01:11:37,190 --> 01:11:38,770
Nothing ever happens.

642
01:11:38,860 --> 01:11:41,700
If the press got hold
of something like this,

643
01:11:41,780 --> 01:11:44,490
not only would Buffalora
be a laughing stock,

644
01:11:44,620 --> 01:11:47,200
but you'd lose your job.

645
01:11:48,250 --> 01:11:50,330
My personal secretary.

646
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:52,630
- Mr. Dellamorte.
- A pleasure.

647
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:54,380
A real pleasure, Mr. Dellamorte.

648
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:55,890
Thank you.

649
01:11:56,180 --> 01:11:58,680
You and I are going
to get along just fine.

650
01:11:59,220 --> 01:11:59,930
Good-bye.

651
01:12:09,530 --> 01:12:10,490
Your name!

652
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:13,080
I didn't get your name...

653
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:30,820
Will I see her again?

654
01:12:42,790 --> 01:12:44,590
Hi!

655
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:50,220
I'm sorry.

656
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:53,560
I didn't mean to frighten you, Miss.

657
01:12:55,020 --> 01:12:57,320
I was expecting someone else.

658
01:12:58,070 --> 01:13:01,280
Miss! Miss!

659
01:13:14,930 --> 01:13:16,850
Ever since I got to Buffalora,

660
01:13:16,930 --> 01:13:19,640
strange things have
been happening to me.

661
01:13:20,140 --> 01:13:22,360
It's as if I've been here before.

662
01:13:22,770 --> 01:13:24,440
And that grave...

663
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:28,700
And you, Mr. Dellamorte, it's as if

664
01:13:28,780 --> 01:13:30,790
I've known you forever.

665
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:34,170
As if I've loved you forever!

666
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:39,130
You love me, too?

667
01:13:41,010 --> 01:13:42,060
Why?

668
01:13:42,180 --> 01:13:44,140
Who else is there?

669
01:13:47,610 --> 01:13:49,360
I love you as well.

670
01:13:50,530 --> 01:13:51,780
I love you.

671
01:13:57,410 --> 01:13:59,710
I've heard what they
say about you in town.

672
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:02,000
Is it true that you don't...

673
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:04,930
I mean, that you can't...

674
01:14:05,010 --> 01:14:07,350
No, you don't wanna
believe town gossip.

675
01:14:07,430 --> 01:14:10,680
Because I can only love an impotent man.

676
01:14:13,190 --> 01:14:15,690
Yeah, it's true. It's true.

677
01:14:15,780 --> 01:14:17,110
I like men...

678
01:14:19,450 --> 01:14:22,660
but their manhood terrifies me.

679
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:26,710
I can't stand the thought
of them having a...

680
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:30,170
I mean... you understand?

681
01:14:32,130 --> 01:14:34,140
It's a sort of phobia I have.

682
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:38,390
I don't have one, I don't
have anything at all.

683
01:14:39,140 --> 01:14:40,190
Will you marry me?

684
01:15:11,780 --> 01:15:13,700
I'm getting married!

685
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:14,700
Gna!

686
01:15:16,290 --> 01:15:17,750
I'm really getting married!

687
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:19,290
Don't pretend you
didn't hear everything.

688
01:15:19,540 --> 01:15:20,960
Gna!

689
01:15:21,090 --> 01:15:22,760
Yeah? Why not?

690
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:24,300
Go ahead, explain...

691
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:29,020
God gracious...

692
01:15:29,140 --> 01:15:30,270
What are you saying?

693
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:31,730
You heard me!

694
01:15:32,150 --> 01:15:33,690
My dear boy,

695
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:38,320
you must be very run down.
I'm going to give you some pills.

696
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:42,670
Dr Vercesi, I'm serious.

697
01:15:43,420 --> 01:15:45,840
Look, I'm not going to be
intimidated in my own surgery.

698
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,170
That waiting room there

699
01:15:47,250 --> 01:15:49,880
is full of people with good,
honest diseases.

700
01:15:50,010 --> 01:15:50,930
I'll pay you...

701
01:15:53,350 --> 01:15:54,680
Yes I know, but...

702
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:58,650
How can I? I mean,
everybody knows that...

703
01:15:59,190 --> 01:16:00,440
you haven't got one.

704
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:18,140
I see. You have got one.

705
01:16:18,220 --> 01:16:22,140
When would you like me
to relieve you of your...

706
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:24,520
- ...problem?
- Now.

707
01:16:46,850 --> 01:16:49,140
What are you waiting
for? Get on with it!

708
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:03,540
Now what?

709
01:17:10,850 --> 01:17:12,720
I told you I don't want an anaesthetic.

710
01:17:12,810 --> 01:17:13,850
It's not an anaesthetic.

711
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:15,440
What is it, then?

712
01:17:16,270 --> 01:17:19,900
One shot of this, it'll be
as if you've never had one.

713
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:22,120
It lasts for over a month.

714
01:17:22,660 --> 01:17:25,450
Look... please don't
make me cut it away.

715
01:17:25,580 --> 01:17:27,870
Today I'm just not up to it.

716
01:17:29,630 --> 01:17:31,510
What are you doing, turning over?

717
01:17:31,590 --> 01:17:33,170
I have to give you
the shot in the front.

718
01:17:33,510 --> 01:17:34,510
Front where?

719
01:17:35,340 --> 01:17:39,020
Hold still, I'll just make a puncture.

720
01:18:07,310 --> 01:18:09,400
That fucking butcher

721
01:18:09,690 --> 01:18:12,820
has given me some kind of infection.

722
01:18:14,070 --> 01:18:15,410
Gnaghi!

723
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:19,000
I'm hovering between life and death.

724
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:20,250
Gna!

725
01:18:21,170 --> 01:18:22,630
Yeah, you're right.

726
01:18:22,710 --> 01:18:24,920
I suppose I'm used to this condition.

727
01:18:28,470 --> 01:18:32,350
That's her. Don't let her
in. Tell her I'm not here.

728
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:34,650
I don't want her to see me like this.

729
01:18:42,540 --> 01:18:44,620
- I must see Mr. Dellamorte.
- Gna!

730
01:18:44,750 --> 01:18:48,500
Please, I've got to speak
to him, is he in there?

731
01:18:50,380 --> 01:18:52,890
I'd give my life to be dead.

732
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,190
Gnaghi!

733
01:18:58,310 --> 01:19:00,060
It doesn't hurt anymore.

734
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:02,270
I think I'm better.

735
01:19:05,490 --> 01:19:06,660
Gna!

736
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:08,620
When did t happen?

737
01:19:14,290 --> 01:19:15,840
She was our nicest client.

738
01:19:16,590 --> 01:19:18,680
The best always die first.

739
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:19,930
Gna!

740
01:19:39,630 --> 01:19:42,630
Where have you been?
I thought I'd go mad.

741
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:45,140
If you only knew what happened to me.

742
01:19:45,260 --> 01:19:47,060
If you only knew what happened to me...

743
01:19:48,180 --> 01:19:50,350
I must talk to you.

744
01:19:53,940 --> 01:19:55,820
We'll always be together.

745
01:19:56,030 --> 01:19:57,910
Yes, my love, yes.

746
01:20:00,990 --> 01:20:03,500
I don't know how to say this, but

747
01:20:03,620 --> 01:20:06,340
- the Mayor raped me.
- No!

748
01:20:06,380 --> 01:20:09,340
Wait! I liked it.

749
01:20:09,430 --> 01:20:10,930
Not the violence, no.

750
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:14,180
But after that, we did it again nicely,

751
01:20:14,180 --> 01:20:17,100
so that I'd forgive him.

752
01:20:17,810 --> 01:20:21,070
It was wonderful, do you understand?

753
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:25,740
That means I'm cured. I
don't have a phobia anymore.

754
01:20:26,870 --> 01:20:29,080
I can't marry you, now.

755
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:33,460
I'm going to marry him.

756
01:20:34,380 --> 01:20:36,800
That doesn't mean
anything though, I mean,

757
01:20:37,130 --> 01:20:40,430
nothing's changed
between us, I still love you.

758
01:20:40,890 --> 01:20:42,230
You know that.

759
01:20:42,980 --> 01:20:47,320
I just love you in a different
way, but you're important to me.

760
01:20:48,070 --> 01:20:51,830
He knows, I mean, about you and me.

761
01:20:52,370 --> 01:20:53,830
He's a wonderful man,

762
01:20:53,910 --> 01:20:56,000
he said he's happy we can be friends.

763
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:58,170
We can still see each other.

764
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:00,380
Nothing's changed.

765
01:21:01,010 --> 01:21:03,390
Everything's just as it was.

766
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:07,060
Everything.

767
01:21:26,670 --> 01:21:30,430
You look for Death in the clear night,

768
01:21:31,470 --> 01:21:33,980
you tell her you still love her,

769
01:21:34,690 --> 01:21:36,980
that you are her slave,

770
01:21:37,820 --> 01:21:40,030
that she's still your queen.

771
01:21:40,240 --> 01:21:42,320
Death, Death,

772
01:21:43,370 --> 01:21:45,450
Death, the whore.

773
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:00,060
No, I'd only do it for the fear

774
01:22:00,890 --> 01:22:03,190
and I'd come back

775
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:06,320
just to experience the same fear again.

776
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:08,950
To be afraid,

777
01:22:09,660 --> 01:22:12,240
always to be afraid.

778
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:21,470
Hi!

779
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:26,480
Is that white VW outside yours?

780
01:22:29,150 --> 01:22:30,820
We're on foot.

781
01:22:31,230 --> 01:22:33,450
Could you give us a lift?

782
01:22:34,070 --> 01:22:35,410
It's not very far.

783
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:38,870
Go on!

784
01:22:40,670 --> 01:22:41,790
I'm Magda.

785
01:22:44,170 --> 01:22:46,930
And this is Laura.

786
01:22:54,520 --> 01:22:56,070
How far is it?

787
01:23:02,330 --> 01:23:05,040
This is where we live,
with another girlfriend.

788
01:23:13,640 --> 01:23:16,430
Do you want to come up for a drink?

789
01:23:17,140 --> 01:23:20,810
Come on, you're not afraid
of two college girls, are you?

790
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:29,080
Make a wish. I grant wishes.

791
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:33,120
I want you to fall in love with me.

792
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:41,600
But I'm already in love with you.

793
01:23:41,890 --> 01:23:43,850
Haven't you noticed?

794
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:52,410
It's cold in here.

795
01:23:55,660 --> 01:23:58,290
If you'd like to wash,
there's a sink there.

796
01:24:14,570 --> 01:24:17,150
I didn't mean your face, silly!

797
01:24:18,070 --> 01:24:20,700
I don't know whether I can do it.

798
01:24:20,830 --> 01:24:22,910
I've been taking some medication...

799
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:37,400
I don't think your
medication is working!

800
01:24:52,710 --> 01:24:54,300
Do you love me?

801
01:24:56,590 --> 01:24:57,840
Yes,

802
01:24:58,140 --> 01:25:00,220
if you stay all night.

803
01:25:02,020 --> 01:25:04,100
All my life, too.

804
01:25:09,530 --> 01:25:12,740
- Come on!
- Let's rest a bit.

805
01:25:12,830 --> 01:25:14,540
- Why?
- You've come three times already.

806
01:25:14,750 --> 01:25:17,250
Twice. The third one was faked.

807
01:25:26,430 --> 01:25:28,600
She's sleeping, she's
been studying all day.

808
01:25:28,850 --> 01:25:30,940
she's got an exam tomorrow morning.

809
01:25:31,230 --> 01:25:34,360
I just wanted to get some wine.

810
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:35,820
Sit down.

811
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:37,780
I'll get you some.

812
01:25:54,180 --> 01:25:57,520
Did Laura tell you you can pay me?

813
01:25:58,150 --> 01:25:58,900
Pay you?

814
01:25:58,900 --> 01:26:01,200
School’s expensive, my friend.

815
01:26:02,950 --> 01:26:03,870
I have to pay you?

816
01:26:04,490 --> 01:26:06,080
We don't have a scholarship, you know.

817
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:10,580
Besides, it's only 100,000 lira.

818
01:26:12,550 --> 01:26:14,430
She told me she loved me...

819
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:17,890
That's 150,000.

820
01:26:18,390 --> 01:26:20,060
She wants me to stay the night.

821
01:26:20,690 --> 01:26:22,650
200,000.

822
01:26:23,110 --> 01:26:24,520
Is a cheque all right?

823
01:26:24,860 --> 01:26:26,740
It's money, isn't it?

824
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:30,200
Hurry, darling.

825
01:26:30,410 --> 01:26:32,580
I'm cold.

826
01:26:32,870 --> 01:26:34,960
Come and warm me up.

827
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:39,800
I need your warmth.

828
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:42,800
Warm me up.

829
01:26:43,510 --> 01:26:45,220
Coming, love.

830
01:26:49,980 --> 01:26:51,650
Now you'll be warm forever.

831
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:22,450
This time I'm really through with love.

832
01:27:44,650 --> 01:27:47,990
I bet you'd like to know where I was
between 1 and 3 last night, wouldn't you?

833
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:49,580
I know, I know.

834
01:27:49,910 --> 01:27:52,080
Here we are. Have no fear,

835
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:53,750
I won't tell anybody about this cheque,

836
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:55,750
this is the reason I came here.

837
01:27:56,050 --> 01:27:58,420
We're both worldly men, aren't we?

838
01:27:59,930 --> 01:28:02,430
- But this could be proof against...
- Proof against whom?

839
01:28:02,510 --> 01:28:04,600
We've already arrested
the guilty party.

840
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:06,480
After setting fire to the apartment,

841
01:28:06,610 --> 01:28:08,570
he went home, killed
his wife and daughter,

842
01:28:08,690 --> 01:28:13,360
then turned himself in. He's at
the hospital, the psychiatric ward.

843
01:28:15,030 --> 01:28:17,750
Somebody's stolen my crimes!

844
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:30,560
Sir?

845
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:33,810
Excuse me, this section
is closed to the public.

846
01:28:33,900 --> 01:28:35,150
I've come to see the killer.

847
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:37,780
But you can't go in
there. He's in a coma.

848
01:28:37,990 --> 01:28:39,860
He drank a whole bottle of iodine.

849
01:28:40,070 --> 01:28:42,160
I have to take his measurements.

850
01:28:44,660 --> 01:28:46,330
Franco!

851
01:28:51,130 --> 01:28:54,600
You looked a lot better the last
time we talked on the phone.

852
01:29:21,310 --> 01:29:22,430
Thief!

853
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:26,190
You're a thief...

854
01:29:27,650 --> 01:29:31,740
You may have killed your wife and
daughter, OK, I'll give you that,

855
01:29:31,740 --> 01:29:33,830
but it was me who knocked
off the three girls.

856
01:29:33,910 --> 01:29:36,500
What are you doing stealing my murders?

857
01:29:36,620 --> 01:29:38,790
What kind of fucking
friend do you think you are?

858
01:29:40,170 --> 01:29:42,590
Especially as you thought
you were doing me a favour.

859
01:29:42,670 --> 01:29:44,470
Put that out immediately!

860
01:29:44,550 --> 01:29:45,680
- Smoking is not allowed in here!
- Shut up!

861
01:29:51,100 --> 01:29:53,610
He's in a coma. He doesn't even notice.

862
01:29:53,690 --> 01:29:55,280
Shit.

863
01:29:56,240 --> 01:29:57,780
What'd you say?

864
01:30:06,550 --> 01:30:09,300
Everything's shit.

865
01:30:09,380 --> 01:30:12,640
The only thing that's not shitty...

866
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:15,560
is sleep.

867
01:30:15,640 --> 01:30:16,980
What are you doing on the floor, sister?

868
01:30:17,230 --> 01:30:18,230
She's praying.

869
01:30:18,650 --> 01:30:20,240
Friend of yours?

870
01:30:20,440 --> 01:30:24,120
Look, he hasn't got any relatives
and the coma he's in is irreversible.

871
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:25,450
Give me a signature

872
01:30:25,740 --> 01:30:28,370
- and I'll pull the plug now.
- Fuck off!

873
01:30:43,810 --> 01:30:46,740
Here we go. Put it back in there.

874
01:30:47,570 --> 01:30:49,530
I won't let you die

875
01:30:50,070 --> 01:30:52,370
until you give me an explanation.

876
01:30:53,410 --> 01:30:55,290
Why did you steal my murders?

877
01:30:58,300 --> 01:31:01,470
Don't you think anything
I do counts? Huh?

878
01:31:01,550 --> 01:31:03,140
Oh, my God! What happened?

879
01:31:03,430 --> 01:31:06,890
They killed each other. It
was a settling of scores.

880
01:31:07,810 --> 01:31:09,150
Don't you believe me?

881
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:10,730
- No!
- Tough.

882
01:31:16,280 --> 01:31:17,910
So bad...

883
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:23,670
So,

884
01:31:24,090 --> 01:31:27,340
is that all you have any need
to say to your only friend?

885
01:31:31,510 --> 01:31:33,270
Who are you?

886
01:31:33,690 --> 01:31:35,770
I don't know you.

887
01:31:35,980 --> 01:31:38,280
I don't know who you are.

888
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:39,860
Go away.

889
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:43,700
Go away!

890
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:00,600
Dellamorte, wait.

891
01:32:01,150 --> 01:32:04,230
For God's sake, wait! There's
another maniac on the loose.

892
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:06,240
He's on the 4th floor killing people.

893
01:32:06,450 --> 01:32:09,160
He already shot three.
You got a gun!

894
01:32:09,490 --> 01:32:11,450
That's good. Now you can defend yourself.

895
01:32:11,660 --> 01:32:14,920
Hey, take my advice and get
the hell out of here quick!

896
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:18,260
Straniero!

897
01:32:18,420 --> 01:32:19,930
It was me!

898
01:33:14,050 --> 01:33:15,720
You and I are both the same.

899
01:33:18,020 --> 01:33:20,440
We kill out of indifference,

900
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:23,530
out of love sometimes,

901
01:33:26,780 --> 01:33:28,870
but never out of hate.

902
01:33:35,130 --> 01:33:37,720
Now I don't know who's dead or alive.

903
01:33:38,970 --> 01:33:40,350
I'm sick of killing.

904
01:33:43,480 --> 01:33:46,480
So I'm leaving the game, brother.

905
01:33:47,980 --> 01:33:50,910
Dellamorte Dellamore

906
01:33:50,990 --> 01:33:53,280
bids you farewell

907
01:33:53,830 --> 01:33:56,080
and is on his way.

908
01:33:56,620 --> 01:33:58,420
Where to?

909
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:05,680
Better get out of here.

910
01:34:06,010 --> 01:34:08,430
Even the statue's talking.

911
01:34:10,390 --> 01:34:12,900
Where do you think you're going?

912
01:34:12,940 --> 01:34:15,530
if you haven't yet
understood the difference

913
01:34:15,610 --> 01:34:18,320
between life and me.

914
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:34,060
Gnaghi, you're not bringing that!

915
01:34:38,980 --> 01:34:41,820
That coffin is not coming with us!

916
01:35:18,210 --> 01:35:20,800
Yeah, I missed that one. Don't
worry, I'll get the next one.

917
01:35:21,220 --> 01:35:24,680
Oh calm down. I know
every bump on this road.

918
01:35:26,890 --> 01:35:28,560
There's one!

919
01:35:31,980 --> 01:35:33,320
Look!

920
01:35:35,820 --> 01:35:38,240
I'd never been this far.

921
01:35:40,120 --> 01:35:42,080
We made it, Gnaghi!

922
01:35:46,590 --> 01:35:48,880
Who could have imagined this?

923
01:35:49,010 --> 01:35:51,930
Wider than all the streets
of Buffalora put together.

924
01:35:52,430 --> 01:35:55,770
- It never seems to end!
- Gna!

925
01:35:57,520 --> 01:35:59,320
Hang on, Gnaghi.

926
01:36:00,030 --> 01:36:02,530
Past this tunnel is
the rest of the world.

927
01:36:12,460 --> 01:36:14,890
What do you think the rest of
the world looks like, Gnaghi?

928
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:17,140
Can you imagine it?

929
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:25,610
You're right. It's beyond imagination.

930
01:37:18,740 --> 01:37:20,580
I should have known it.

931
01:37:23,410 --> 01:37:25,500
The rest of the world doesn't exist.

932
01:37:36,850 --> 01:37:37,930
Gnaghi!

933
01:37:39,350 --> 01:37:41,770
Gnaghi, you weren't
hit that hard. Come on.

934
01:37:41,860 --> 01:37:44,070
Come on, I'll take you
to the car. Come on,

935
01:37:44,110 --> 01:37:45,610
Come on! Why are you going on
like this? You've just got cut.

936
01:37:45,870 --> 01:37:47,950
Come on man, get up,
I'll take you to the car!

937
01:37:48,120 --> 01:37:50,330
Come on! Come on, get up!

938
01:37:50,870 --> 01:37:53,120
What? What?

939
01:37:53,250 --> 01:37:54,500
Gnaghi!

940
01:37:58,050 --> 01:37:59,090
Gnaghi!

941
01:38:00,470 --> 01:38:04,520
Don't leave me alone
now. Gnaghi! Gnaghi!

942
01:38:07,650 --> 01:38:09,530
Oh God!

943
01:38:10,070 --> 01:38:10,900
Death,

944
01:38:11,320 --> 01:38:14,410
death, death comes sweeping down,

945
01:38:15,080 --> 01:38:17,870
filthy death the leering clown,

946
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:20,800
death on wings, death by surprise,

947
01:38:20,920 --> 01:38:23,420
veiling evil from worldly eyes,

948
01:38:23,420 --> 01:38:25,090
death that's born

949
01:38:25,180 --> 01:38:27,680
as life succumbs, while death and love

950
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:30,180
two kindred drums, beat the time

951
01:38:30,270 --> 01:38:32,060
till Judgement Day,

952
01:38:32,270 --> 01:38:33,320
an actor

953
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:34,690
in a Passion Play,

954
01:38:34,780 --> 01:38:36,530
without beginning, without end,

955
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:39,160
evermore.

956
01:38:39,370 --> 01:38:40,950
Amen.

957
01:39:06,160 --> 01:39:08,910
You're my best friend.

958
01:39:11,710 --> 01:39:14,420
I didn't even realise it.

959
01:40:05,130 --> 01:40:06,920
Could you take me home?

960
01:40:07,010 --> 01:40:08,590
Please.

961
01:40:12,640 --> 01:40:14,020
Gna.
