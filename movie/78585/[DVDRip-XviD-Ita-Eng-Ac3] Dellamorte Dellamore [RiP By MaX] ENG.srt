1
00:00:36,367 --> 00:00:41,919
- HeIIo ? - It's me. Am I bothering
you, Francesco ? - Don't worry.

2
00:00:41,967 --> 00:00:46,916
Had to get out of the shower,
sometime. HoId on a minute, Franco.

3
00:01:05,487 --> 00:01:07,205
You were saying, Franco ?

4
00:01:07,247 --> 00:01:10,762
Nothing, just caIIing
to see how you're doing.

5
00:01:10,807 --> 00:01:13,241
You know how things are.

6
00:01:16,887 --> 00:01:19,196
Life goes on !

7
00:01:50,287 --> 00:01:52,278
Gnaghi !

8
00:02:16,847 --> 00:02:21,523
- Gnaghi ! - Gna ? - I've been
shouting at you for hours !

9
00:02:37,367 --> 00:02:39,801
He's Chigini, the surveyor.

10
00:02:39,847 --> 00:02:43,556
- TweIfth row, third grave, right ?
- Gna.

11
00:02:55,367 --> 00:02:57,437
Grave three.

12
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:02,125
Here we go.
I know you've heard this before.

13
00:03:02,167 --> 00:03:07,195
But this time,
my dear Chigini, it is forever !

14
00:03:08,527 --> 00:03:10,757
Rest in peace.

15
00:03:12,607 --> 00:03:14,882
Oh, my back !

16
00:03:23,047 --> 00:03:26,198
What a waste of good marbIe !
We'II never fix it.

17
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:28,158
AII this fancy packaging.

18
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:31,404
I don't know why they don't just
cover the graves with dirt !

19
00:04:19,167 --> 00:04:22,000
The gun !
I forgot the fucking gun !

20
00:04:22,047 --> 00:04:24,959
- Eat !
- Gnaghi !

21
00:04:25,007 --> 00:04:29,523
Give me the spade ! Gnaghi,
give me the fucking spade !

22
00:04:30,607 --> 00:04:32,006
Eat !

23
00:04:40,327 --> 00:04:42,397
There we go.

24
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:47,441
You know the rest, Gnaghi.

25
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:50,879
My name is Francesco DeIIamorte.

26
00:04:50,927 --> 00:04:53,805
Weird name, isn't it ?
Francis of Death.

27
00:04:53,847 --> 00:04:56,156
Saint Francis of Death.

28
00:04:56,207 --> 00:04:58,402
I've often thought
of having it changed.

29
00:04:58,447 --> 00:05:01,519
Andrea DeIIamorte
wouId be nicer, for exampIe.

30
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,764
I'm the watchman
of the BuffaIora cemetery.

31
00:05:04,807 --> 00:05:06,763
I don't know
how the epidemic started.

32
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:10,595
Some peopIe, on the seventh night
after their death,

33
00:05:10,647 --> 00:05:14,526
come back to Iife:
I caII them ''Returners''.

34
00:05:14,927 --> 00:05:18,158
But, frankIy, I can't understand
why they're so anxious to return.

35
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:22,359
The onIy way to get rid of them
is to spIit their heads open.

36
00:05:22,407 --> 00:05:25,797
A spade wiII do it,
but a Dum-Dum buIIet is best.

37
00:05:26,447 --> 00:05:29,325
- Come and have a gIass of wine.
- Gna !

38
00:05:30,567 --> 00:05:34,924
Is it the beginning of an invasion,
does it happen in aII cemeteries ?

39
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:39,358
Or is BuffaIora just an exception ?
Who knows ?

40
00:05:39,407 --> 00:05:43,161
And in the end, who cares ?
I'm just doing my job !

41
00:05:51,327 --> 00:05:53,238
Good morning, Engineer !

42
00:05:53,287 --> 00:05:56,996
- How are you doing today ?
- Fine, Miss Chiaromondo. And you ?

43
00:05:57,047 --> 00:06:00,926
- The cemetery is open, isn't it ?
- For you, anytime.

44
00:06:00,967 --> 00:06:07,486
Oh, heIIo, cutie ! Here.
How are you ?

45
00:06:07,527 --> 00:06:10,997
He's happy. He Iikes it
when the sun shines.

46
00:06:16,647 --> 00:06:19,002
I'm not an engineer !

47
00:06:20,687 --> 00:06:22,882
And you're no cutie !

48
00:06:30,727 --> 00:06:36,518
Poor Gnaghi ! On his ID it reads,
''distinctive visibIe marks: aII''.

49
00:06:38,887 --> 00:06:41,606
He has a passion for dead Ieaves.

50
00:06:41,647 --> 00:06:44,320
Can't stand when the wind
bIows them away.

51
00:06:45,647 --> 00:06:49,401
Oh, weII. We aII do what we can
not to think about Iife.

52
00:07:55,247 --> 00:07:57,920
Requiescat in pace. Amen.

53
00:08:02,207 --> 00:08:05,961
The most beautifuI Iiving woman
I have ever seen !

54
00:08:07,567 --> 00:08:09,558
WiII I see her again ?

55
00:08:37,007 --> 00:08:40,966
I just came to water the fIowers
on your poor father's grave.

56
00:08:42,807 --> 00:08:44,923
Husband.

57
00:08:48,927 --> 00:08:51,043
How Iong has he been dead ?

58
00:08:53,127 --> 00:08:58,759
- Two weeks. - Thank goodness.
- What ? - I mean, I'm very sorry.

59
00:08:58,807 --> 00:09:02,004
- Have you no respect for pain ?
- I know how these things are.

60
00:09:02,047 --> 00:09:06,006
- In time, pain heaIs.
- It's not heaIing a bit !

61
00:09:10,087 --> 00:09:13,796
He was wonderfuI !
He was a wonderfuI Iover.

62
00:09:13,847 --> 00:09:17,237
IncredibIe... tireIess...

63
00:09:18,887 --> 00:09:21,526
He was fantastic !

64
00:09:49,087 --> 00:09:54,923
I messed it aII up. I've Iost her.
WiII I see her again ?

65
00:09:59,407 --> 00:10:00,726
BUFFALORA CITY HALL.

66
00:10:04,247 --> 00:10:07,045
Hey, Franco !

67
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:13,997
Franco is the onIy Iiving person
who even caIIs me.

68
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:17,960
I stop by his office to remind
myseIf what he Iooks Iike.

69
00:10:18,007 --> 00:10:20,965
You can't Iive on memories aIone.

70
00:10:26,047 --> 00:10:28,720
It's for you. Sign as usuaI.

71
00:10:31,127 --> 00:10:33,163
You got a pen ?

72
00:10:33,207 --> 00:10:36,404
- No.
- HoId on a sec. Here we are.

73
00:10:41,287 --> 00:10:44,802
- Did you have any visits
Iast night ? - A coupIe, yeah.

74
00:10:46,807 --> 00:10:50,356
AII this extra work. It's much
if they pay me any more !

75
00:10:50,407 --> 00:10:55,162
- TeII the mayor. - TeII him, then
what ? They'd cIose the cemetery.

76
00:10:55,207 --> 00:10:59,200
- Goodbye job and goodbye house.
- Come on, who wouId beIieve you ?

77
00:10:59,247 --> 00:11:03,035
I don't care if you don't beIieve
me. You're not the one who pays me.

78
00:11:03,327 --> 00:11:05,716
I beIieve you.

79
00:11:05,767 --> 00:11:08,725
- You're right. At Ieast have him
pay you the overtime. - Good !

80
00:11:08,767 --> 00:11:11,839
- Let's go to the mayor, then.
- It's not that easy.

81
00:11:11,887 --> 00:11:14,447
First you have to fiII out
an M3 form.

82
00:11:14,487 --> 00:11:18,685
Report with an M3 form...
Forms.

83
00:11:19,647 --> 00:11:24,277
- I can speed things up for you.
- It's easier just to shoot them.

84
00:11:26,487 --> 00:11:28,239
One M3 form.

85
00:11:29,047 --> 00:11:33,040
- Going to get our wiIIies wet
tonight ? - Some of us, yeah.

86
00:11:35,207 --> 00:11:39,758
At a certain point you reaIise you
know more dead peopIe than Iiving.

87
00:12:48,487 --> 00:12:52,002
Sorry about the other day, I was
a bit crass. I didn't mean to be.

88
00:12:52,047 --> 00:12:54,766
My name's Francesco DeIIamorte.

89
00:12:55,847 --> 00:13:00,523
This is the onIy job I couId get,
even with a degree in bioIogy !

90
00:13:02,007 --> 00:13:05,443
Anyway, we aII end up here
sooner or Iater, don't we ?

91
00:13:05,487 --> 00:13:08,923
I got a great IittIe house.
Want to see it ?

92
00:13:09,567 --> 00:13:12,365
I don't Iive aIone,
I've got a heIper, Gnaghi.

93
00:13:12,407 --> 00:13:14,921
He's a reaI conversationist.

94
00:13:16,847 --> 00:13:19,919
The cemetery's smaII but
it has got a marveIIous ossuary.

95
00:13:23,287 --> 00:13:25,437
An ossuary !

96
00:13:38,487 --> 00:13:42,799
I have never seen anything so...
exciting !

97
00:13:42,847 --> 00:13:45,077
Neither have I.

98
00:14:15,247 --> 00:14:19,286
- It's Iike in my dreams !
- This is my dream.

99
00:14:21,287 --> 00:14:25,405
- I couIdn't ask for anything
more ! - Me neither.

100
00:14:29,287 --> 00:14:33,326
You know, you've got
a reaI nice ossuary.

101
00:14:33,527 --> 00:14:35,324
Thanks.

102
00:14:36,567 --> 00:14:40,480
You wiII aIIow me to return,
won't you ?

103
00:14:40,527 --> 00:14:44,566
- You wiII aIIow me to kiss you
just once, won't you ? - No.

104
00:14:44,607 --> 00:14:46,438
Not Iike this.

105
00:14:53,127 --> 00:14:54,879
Like this.

106
00:15:20,247 --> 00:15:21,600
No !

107
00:15:22,647 --> 00:15:25,764
I must be faithfuI to the memory
of my husband !

108
00:15:26,167 --> 00:15:29,000
I can't ! I can't.

109
00:15:29,687 --> 00:15:33,362
It's not my fauIt. It's this pIace.

110
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:40,516
I feeI strange tremors.
It's not the coId, I'm not afraid.

111
00:15:40,567 --> 00:15:44,321
This pIace wants me to...
It's forcing me to...

112
00:15:46,127 --> 00:15:48,038
I don't want to !

113
00:15:49,567 --> 00:15:51,717
I don't want to !

114
00:15:53,487 --> 00:15:55,682
I can't !

115
00:15:56,967 --> 00:15:59,037
I can't !

116
00:15:59,087 --> 00:16:01,965
No ! No !

117
00:18:34,687 --> 00:18:37,645
Don't be afraid.
It's just ignis fatuus.

118
00:18:40,807 --> 00:18:44,959
Why here ?
Why on your poor husband's grave ?

119
00:18:45,527 --> 00:18:49,679
I've never kept anything from him.
We trusted each other impIicitIy.

120
00:18:50,967 --> 00:18:53,083
He wouId have Iiked to know.

121
00:18:54,727 --> 00:18:57,366
WeII, if that's the case...

122
00:19:06,487 --> 00:19:09,399
- These Iights !
- Let them watch.

123
00:19:09,447 --> 00:19:12,484
What's better than watching
two Iovers making Iove ?

124
00:19:15,247 --> 00:19:17,807
Just to have a bit of privacy.

125
00:19:28,447 --> 00:19:31,325
Sorry, the Iady wants stars onIy.

126
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:03,802
It's never been Iike this before.
With anybody but you.

127
00:21:04,687 --> 00:21:06,882
No-one wiII ever make us part.

128
00:21:11,407 --> 00:21:13,284
Gnaghi, the gun !

129
00:21:14,687 --> 00:21:18,680
I can expIain, Iisten to me ! You
have aIways been so understanding !

130
00:21:19,047 --> 00:21:20,765
That's Iife.

131
00:21:41,327 --> 00:21:44,319
It's nothing, my Iove.
You're fine.

132
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:50,004
- Great ! Just when I don't need it
any more ! - Gna...

133
00:21:50,047 --> 00:21:53,483
Don't just stand there,
go caII Dr. Vercesi !

134
00:21:54,287 --> 00:21:58,803
Go on, get the doctor !
Go on, move !

135
00:21:59,847 --> 00:22:03,601
Nothing wiII separate us.
I swear. Nothing !

136
00:22:11,007 --> 00:22:13,760
Nothing wiII separate us.

137
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:16,797
Nothing, my Iove. Nothing !

138
00:22:19,967 --> 00:22:23,801
- Not even Death.
- Not even Death.

139
00:23:00,207 --> 00:23:04,120
DeIIamorte ? Are you in there ?
DeIIamorte !

140
00:23:16,727 --> 00:23:19,036
Jesus, you scared me to death !

141
00:23:19,087 --> 00:23:22,284
- You're Iooking for me, chief
Straniero ? - Dr. Vercesi caIIed.

142
00:23:22,327 --> 00:23:25,717
- What happened Iast night ? - Why
are you asking me ? She's dead.

143
00:23:25,767 --> 00:23:28,884
I know she's dead,
but how did that happen ?

144
00:23:29,527 --> 00:23:31,882
- Her husband.
- Sure !

145
00:23:31,927 --> 00:23:35,602
He came back from the dead, raped
her then beat her to death, right ?

146
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:39,560
- No, he didn't rape her. - You
aIways crack me up, you know ?

147
00:23:39,607 --> 00:23:43,600
- Dr. Vercesi, are you spying
on us ? - Here's the certificate.

148
00:23:43,647 --> 00:23:46,445
Her heart stopped from fear,
it wasn't a bite that kiIIed her.

149
00:23:46,487 --> 00:23:50,400
She died whiIe making...
you know... Doing it.

150
00:23:50,607 --> 00:23:52,962
You know what that means, my boy ?

151
00:23:53,007 --> 00:23:55,441
I'II have to Iook somewhere eIse
for the creep who kiIIed her.

152
00:23:55,487 --> 00:23:58,047
- You're no Ionger a suspect.
- Why not ?

153
00:23:58,087 --> 00:24:02,478
You know what I mean.
Don't make me say it.

154
00:24:02,527 --> 00:24:05,599
Go on, you can say it.
I don't mind. I'm impotent !

155
00:24:05,647 --> 00:24:08,764
Don't use that word. A young man
Iike you, at your age !

156
00:24:08,807 --> 00:24:12,277
- Did she have any reIatives ?
- No. No reIatives, no friends.

157
00:24:14,247 --> 00:24:20,243
WeII, I have to say that... Shit !
This is definiteIy not my styIe.

158
00:24:21,327 --> 00:24:24,125
- Can I keep her here ?
- If you pay for the funeraI...

159
00:24:24,167 --> 00:24:26,203
You can do
whatever you want with her.

160
00:24:26,247 --> 00:24:28,715
- Does that wrap it up ?
- But a kiIIer's on the Iose.

161
00:24:30,447 --> 00:24:33,166
The weather's changing, at Iast !

162
00:24:53,287 --> 00:24:56,484
I can't forgive myseIf
for having Iied to you.

163
00:24:56,527 --> 00:24:59,724
I don't have a degree in bioIogy.

164
00:24:59,767 --> 00:25:02,565
I didn't even finish high schooI.

165
00:25:05,607 --> 00:25:09,043
I haven't read more than two books
in my whoIe Iife.

166
00:25:09,887 --> 00:25:14,039
One... never finished.

167
00:25:16,327 --> 00:25:19,046
The other's the phone book.

168
00:25:37,567 --> 00:25:40,127
I don't want her
to become a Returner.

169
00:25:40,167 --> 00:25:42,920
I don't want to see her again.

170
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:11,043
- No !
- Yes, my Iove.

171
00:26:12,127 --> 00:26:16,757
- Don't make me do it !
- But you do it so weII !

172
00:26:17,487 --> 00:26:22,436
- Not to you. - It wiII be better
with me than with the others.

173
00:27:07,767 --> 00:27:09,200
Gna ?

174
00:27:16,647 --> 00:27:18,399
You do it.

175
00:27:19,647 --> 00:27:24,277
Go on ! If you finish fast,
I'II buy you an ice cream.

176
00:27:33,887 --> 00:27:36,242
Here comes the Unforgiven !

177
00:27:38,087 --> 00:27:42,365
The man whose dick's so smaII
he needs tweezers !

178
00:27:43,407 --> 00:27:44,840
Way to go !

179
00:27:44,887 --> 00:27:49,358
- He couId become a woman. That'd
soIve it ! - You can sew it back !

180
00:27:49,407 --> 00:27:52,046
They can stitch it right on
if you've got one to start with.

181
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,123
Forget it, I started that rumour.

182
00:27:54,167 --> 00:27:56,237
The more they Iaugh,
the further away they seem.

183
00:27:56,287 --> 00:27:59,245
You can never be too different,
Gnaghi.

184
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:03,004
- Maybe you can.
- Engineer !

185
00:28:03,767 --> 00:28:07,282
Engineer ! Come, have a seat.

186
00:28:08,127 --> 00:28:13,724
- WeII, weII. What a surprise.
- It's a miracIe to see you here.

187
00:28:14,647 --> 00:28:17,081
It's a miracIe seeing you here,
Mr. Mayor.

188
00:28:17,567 --> 00:28:21,958
So, how are things,
down at our cemetery ?

189
00:28:22,007 --> 00:28:25,079
How do you think they are ?
PopuIation's shrinking.

190
00:28:25,127 --> 00:28:28,324
You are Iucky, my dear engineer.

191
00:28:28,367 --> 00:28:31,245
You can't imagine
how things are at the town haII.

192
00:28:31,287 --> 00:28:34,836
Now that the eIections are upon us,
it is chaos ! Right, Inspector ?

193
00:28:34,887 --> 00:28:40,120
- Nobody wants to Iose their job !
- I was hoping for a New DeaI.

194
00:28:40,247 --> 00:28:45,082
- Daddy, what's this ?
- This is my assistant, Gnaghi.

195
00:28:50,207 --> 00:28:53,597
He's sweet !
WiII you buy him, Daddy ?

196
00:28:54,647 --> 00:28:58,003
That's great !
It even knows how to cry.

197
00:28:58,047 --> 00:29:01,562
Gnaghi, don't stay so cIose to her.
CouId you move over, darIing ?

198
00:29:01,607 --> 00:29:04,326
- WouId you teII your daughter
to move over ? - Of course.

199
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:07,916
- Sometimes Gnaghi gets a bit
excited. - I'm sure he's fine.

200
00:29:14,487 --> 00:29:19,356
- What's he doing ? Dancing ?
- No, he's about to...

201
00:29:23,247 --> 00:29:26,876
- What are you doing, VaIentina ?
- He threw up on me, CIaudio !

202
00:29:26,927 --> 00:29:30,363
New fact. WouId you Iike
to go for a ride ?

203
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:33,155
I knew you'd understand.

204
00:29:33,207 --> 00:29:35,402
Take off !

205
00:29:40,127 --> 00:29:44,325
One of these days I have to taIk
to you about the cemetery.

206
00:29:45,047 --> 00:29:48,722
The youth of today !
They're so... emotionaI !

207
00:29:56,967 --> 00:30:00,880
Come on, Gnaghi, get in, for God's
sake ! Just get in the car !

208
00:30:00,927 --> 00:30:03,919
It's not the end of the worId.
It didn't even bother her !

209
00:30:03,967 --> 00:30:07,277
She understood it was just
a demonstration of your affection.

210
00:30:07,327 --> 00:30:10,080
It's not the first time
you threw up over a woman, is it ?

211
00:30:13,287 --> 00:30:15,243
Come on, Gnaghi, get in !

212
00:30:17,047 --> 00:30:21,245
Look, first Iove doesn't count.
It's Iast Iove that counts.

213
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:35,284
Nobody came today. I was a bit
bored. Not even the admiraI.

214
00:30:35,327 --> 00:30:39,957
He's just disappeared !
Let's hope tomorrow.

215
00:30:40,007 --> 00:30:46,480
- Come again and stay awhiIe.
- He was such a distinguished man !

216
00:30:46,847 --> 00:30:52,365
He aIways used to bring me
a touch of Sambuca !

217
00:31:24,887 --> 00:31:29,199
Come on, Gnaghi !
You'II get over it, you'II see.

218
00:31:31,687 --> 00:31:35,236
Time passes,
nothing seems the same.

219
00:31:39,007 --> 00:31:40,804
It just gets worse !

220
00:31:41,447 --> 00:31:44,837
God, is it ever difficuIt
trying to make you feeI better !

221
00:31:46,527 --> 00:31:50,645
What wouId you do with the Mayor's
daughter ? She's onIy a chiId !

222
00:31:54,127 --> 00:31:56,197
That's not true.

223
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:59,557
You're not a chiId.
You're a year oIder than I am.

224
00:31:59,927 --> 00:32:01,883
Anyway...

225
00:32:02,047 --> 00:32:07,599
One day you'II settIe down with
some poor creature Iike yourseIf.

226
00:32:11,207 --> 00:32:16,281
What do you care ? They aII
end up here sooner or Iater.

227
00:32:16,327 --> 00:32:18,045
Often sooner than Iater.

228
00:32:20,447 --> 00:32:22,403
Faster ! Open it up !

229
00:32:24,247 --> 00:32:27,444
- If Daddy couId see us now !
- He'd kiII me.

230
00:32:29,087 --> 00:32:32,204
CIaudio ! Off we go !

231
00:32:37,327 --> 00:32:40,637
Go ! Go !

232
00:32:48,447 --> 00:32:52,326
- Yeah ! - Hang on !
- Eat our dust !

233
00:33:08,367 --> 00:33:11,916
Four motorcycIes, the Mayor's
daughter was on one of them.

234
00:33:11,967 --> 00:33:15,596
Her head was sIiced right off
and had to be sown back.

235
00:33:15,647 --> 00:33:18,684
The bikes crashed into a bus Ioaded
with scouts

236
00:33:18,727 --> 00:33:21,480
on their way back from church.

237
00:33:21,527 --> 00:33:25,679
SIaughter of the innocents !
And they were aII so young.

238
00:33:25,727 --> 00:33:29,242
They feIt their Iife was ahead
of them, but it was passing by !

239
00:33:29,287 --> 00:33:32,996
- WeII, you've got your hands fuII.
- More than you know.

240
00:33:33,047 --> 00:33:35,800
Gnaghi, we're going to need
a Iot of buIIets.

241
00:33:53,887 --> 00:33:58,915
CIaudio ! Take me with you !
Don't Ieave me aII aIone !

242
00:33:58,967 --> 00:34:01,276
Take me with you, my Iove !

243
00:34:01,327 --> 00:34:05,843
Nasty tart !
My son wasn't with you !

244
00:34:05,887 --> 00:34:09,277
- He was promised to the Mayor's
daughter ! - But he Ioved me !

245
00:34:09,327 --> 00:34:14,162
- Liar ! - He was mine,
he Ioved me, onIy me !

246
00:34:14,207 --> 00:34:18,758
- Have you no respect for
a mother ? - We're born to die.

247
00:34:19,327 --> 00:34:22,876
Born mereIy to die !
Do you remember ?

248
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:28,524
Just yesterday, she was aIive,
happy. Do you remember ?

249
00:34:28,927 --> 00:34:34,081
Dear Gnaghi even threw up on her
and she took it so weII !

250
00:34:34,127 --> 00:34:39,838
And now, she's gone.
Right on the eve of the eIections !

251
00:34:39,887 --> 00:34:42,355
I'd better get the pickaxe
and shoveI.

252
00:34:42,407 --> 00:34:47,083
Pumpkin,
how couId you do this to me ?

253
00:35:16,167 --> 00:35:19,796
Is it true that the dead come back
to Iife here at night ? TeII me !

254
00:35:19,847 --> 00:35:23,886
- Who toId you that ?
- Is it true or not ?

255
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:28,001
- What if it is ?
- I've got to see CIaudio again !

256
00:35:28,047 --> 00:35:32,802
- I have to know whether he Ioved
me or her. - I'II Iet you know.

257
00:35:33,327 --> 00:35:37,639
- No, wait ! - Go away !
I haven't got time for the Iiving.

258
00:36:16,087 --> 00:36:17,315
Gnaghi ?

259
00:37:00,967 --> 00:37:04,960
Gnaghi ! They came back
sooner than we thought !

260
00:37:06,327 --> 00:37:08,204
Gnaghi, wake up !

261
00:37:26,407 --> 00:37:28,125
Gnaghi, watch out !

262
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:33,964
Gnaghi, I'm sorry !
I didn't mean to.

263
00:38:43,367 --> 00:38:48,395
Time's up. I want you upstairs,
ready in 5 minutes, okay ?

264
00:39:58,127 --> 00:40:00,960
Oh, no ! What's she doing here ?

265
00:40:12,207 --> 00:40:18,123
- Visiting hours are over ! - No
one'II ever take me away from him !

266
00:40:20,487 --> 00:40:25,083
- Get the fuck over here, quick !
- No, CIaudio !

267
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:06,278
No, CIaudio ! Take me with you !

268
00:41:08,927 --> 00:41:11,282
Stupid cow !

269
00:41:14,367 --> 00:41:15,686
Come on !

270
00:41:20,727 --> 00:41:22,763
PIease, wait !

271
00:41:26,167 --> 00:41:31,799
CIaudio, pIease, take me with you !
TeII me you onIy Iove me !

272
00:41:33,087 --> 00:41:35,043
PIease !

273
00:41:50,127 --> 00:41:51,606
CIaudio ?

274
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:55,762
You onIy Iove me, right ?

275
00:42:20,447 --> 00:42:23,120
Damn ! AIways shoots
to the right when it's coId.

276
00:42:45,087 --> 00:42:46,725
Gnaghi !

277
00:43:23,967 --> 00:43:27,516
No, stop ! He's onIy eating me !

278
00:43:27,607 --> 00:43:32,317
- Move aside. - Mind your business,
I'II be eaten by whoever I pIease !

279
00:43:32,367 --> 00:43:35,165
This is my business,
they pay me for it.

280
00:43:47,647 --> 00:43:52,277
The Iiving dead and the dying
Iiving are aII the same.

281
00:43:52,327 --> 00:43:55,603
Cut from the same cIoth.

282
00:43:55,647 --> 00:43:58,684
But disposing of dead peopIe
is a pubIic service.

283
00:43:58,727 --> 00:44:03,403
Whereas you're in troubIe if you
kiII someone when they're aIive.

284
00:44:14,367 --> 00:44:15,720
Wait !

285
00:44:32,167 --> 00:44:34,283
This way they'II be
together forever.

286
00:44:41,247 --> 00:44:43,078
I'm sentimentaI !

287
00:45:02,527 --> 00:45:08,204
Patience, Gnaghi. In Iove, it's
the waiting that's the best part.

288
00:45:08,327 --> 00:45:10,636
You have to Iearn how to wait.

289
00:46:25,767 --> 00:46:30,318
- What's your name again ?
- Gna. - Gnaghi.

290
00:46:35,087 --> 00:46:37,282
I'm VaIentina.

291
00:46:38,047 --> 00:46:40,242
Haven't I seen you before ?

292
00:46:41,727 --> 00:46:47,677
Oh, yeah. Now I remember.
You threw up on me. How sweet !

293
00:46:54,967 --> 00:47:00,087
But I Iike shy boys.
And you never say no to a kiss.

294
00:47:00,127 --> 00:47:04,484
Take advantage.
I'm in no position to refuse.

295
00:47:04,527 --> 00:47:08,361
Besides, I don't think
I'd refuse anyway.

296
00:48:17,607 --> 00:48:19,484
FaIse aIarm !

297
00:48:20,127 --> 00:48:22,197
It was onIy a cat.

298
00:48:30,247 --> 00:48:33,045
No use you try and heIp me,
IittIe thing !

299
00:48:33,407 --> 00:48:35,682
If I can't do it, imagine you !

300
00:48:36,287 --> 00:48:39,324
Putting this skuII together...

301
00:48:39,367 --> 00:48:42,040
is one of the most difficuIt things
in the worId.

302
00:49:15,367 --> 00:49:18,564
You know, you reaIIy are
disgusting when you eat, Gnaghi!

303
00:49:20,767 --> 00:49:25,283
Yes, you're right. It aII does get
mixed up in the stomach in the end.

304
00:49:28,847 --> 00:49:30,678
What is it ?

305
00:50:06,847 --> 00:50:08,519
That wasn't a cat...

306
00:51:49,447 --> 00:51:51,915
We can't ! I'm aIive...

307
00:51:54,727 --> 00:51:56,240
And you are dead.

308
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:59,120
I'm not prejudiced, my Iove.

309
00:53:21,007 --> 00:53:23,077
I kiIIed her.

310
00:53:29,407 --> 00:53:31,557
I kiIIed her !

311
00:53:38,727 --> 00:53:40,843
I kiIIed her.

312
00:53:40,887 --> 00:53:45,199
The first time, when her husband
bit her, she wasn't reaIIy dead.

313
00:53:45,247 --> 00:53:48,444
When she woke up,
and I shot her, she was aIive.

314
00:53:48,487 --> 00:53:53,515
I kiIIed her. I kiIIed
the onIy woman I ever Ioved.

315
00:53:53,567 --> 00:53:57,799
I shot her with my eyes cIosed,
didn't aim for the head.

316
00:53:57,847 --> 00:54:02,159
That's why she came back.
God, what an idiot !

317
00:54:03,287 --> 00:54:08,566
Now I'm infected, too.
WiII I be a Returner when I die ?

318
00:54:09,327 --> 00:54:11,318
Who knows if Gnaghi...

319
00:54:11,567 --> 00:54:13,637
No, poor Gnaghi !

320
00:54:13,687 --> 00:54:16,599
He'd never have the guts
to crush my skuII with a shoveI.

321
00:54:19,007 --> 00:54:22,079
I'm not dead, you idiot !
A bite can't kiII you !

322
00:54:27,607 --> 00:54:30,280
Good morning, Engineer !

323
00:54:30,527 --> 00:54:33,325
Miss Chiaromondo,
I'm not an engineer.

324
00:54:33,367 --> 00:54:37,280
- Are you or not the watchman of
this cemetery ? - Of course I am.

325
00:54:37,327 --> 00:54:40,524
You are therefore an engineer.
By the way...

326
00:54:40,567 --> 00:54:45,960
Which of these do you think
wouId be better on my tombstone ?

327
00:54:51,087 --> 00:54:56,605
- Both. - I Iike the opinion
of a handsome young man !

328
00:54:56,647 --> 00:54:58,797
Goodbye, Engineer !

329
00:55:04,207 --> 00:55:06,357
Good morning, cutie !

330
00:55:23,167 --> 00:55:27,046
But that's the phone book !
Are you crazy ?

331
00:55:27,087 --> 00:55:30,159
That is my favourite reading !

332
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:35,161
We have the new ones but we don't
have to throw the oId ones away.

333
00:55:35,207 --> 00:55:36,925
These books are cIassics !

334
00:55:41,967 --> 00:55:44,606
- Gnaghi !
- Gna !

335
00:56:11,647 --> 00:56:16,562
Stop kiIIing the dead.
They're mine.

336
00:56:16,607 --> 00:56:20,156
If you don't want the dead coming
back to Iife...

337
00:56:20,207 --> 00:56:25,076
why don't you just kiII the Iiving,
shoot them in the head ?

338
00:56:25,127 --> 00:56:27,800
Are you Iistening to me ?

339
00:56:42,687 --> 00:56:45,155
- HeIIo ?
- This is the Town HaII.

340
00:56:45,207 --> 00:56:48,119
- Franco, how are you ? - Bored.
Am I disturbing you ?

341
00:56:48,167 --> 00:56:53,082
- No, you never disturb me. - Just
caIIed to taIk about the scandaI.

342
00:56:53,127 --> 00:56:56,483
- Gnaghi, the door !
- AII that crap. What did you say ?

343
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:02,076
- What the heII was that ?
- Nothing, I'm just working.

344
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:05,756
- What ?
- You know, daiIy grind.

345
00:57:05,807 --> 00:57:08,844
You're teIIing me. Sometimes
I feeI Iike shooting myseIf.

346
00:57:09,927 --> 00:57:14,398
How's everything in your Iife ?
How are dear Mara and Cinzia ?

347
00:57:16,927 --> 00:57:20,442
Sometimes I wonder if they reaIIy
exist, Franco.

348
00:57:23,767 --> 00:57:26,964
I mean, you do have a wife
and daughter, don't you ?

349
00:57:31,807 --> 00:57:33,957
I onIy ask 'cause...

350
00:57:34,007 --> 00:57:36,760
sometimes I think
you've made it aII up.

351
00:57:44,407 --> 00:57:46,762
Franco, you do make me Iaugh.

352
00:57:51,167 --> 00:57:53,158
You'II get out one day.

353
00:57:53,207 --> 00:57:58,998
- BuffaIora wiII be nothing but
a bad memory. - Yeah, or maybe not.

354
00:57:59,047 --> 00:58:03,199
If onIy I couId get unstuck.
I feeI Iike a fIy on fIy paper.

355
00:58:04,367 --> 00:58:07,279
You'II see, Franco.

356
00:58:08,167 --> 00:58:12,285
Mara's going to get tired of you.

357
00:58:13,367 --> 00:58:18,122
And Cinzia wiII grow up to hate
you. Then you'II be free !

358
00:58:19,367 --> 00:58:22,803
Free to see what the rest
of the worId Iooks Iike.

359
00:58:23,487 --> 00:58:26,923
What do you think
the rest of the worId Iooks Iike ?

360
00:58:27,487 --> 00:58:30,479
- The rest of the worId ?
- Uh-uh.

361
00:58:31,847 --> 00:58:35,157
Who knows if the rest
of the worId even exists !

362
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:34,242
At times I get ahead of my work.

363
00:59:35,847 --> 00:59:37,917
Work !

364
00:59:45,727 --> 00:59:47,638
DeIIamorte !

365
00:59:50,967 --> 00:59:52,923
DeIIamorte !

366
00:59:54,407 --> 00:59:56,557
Gnaghi !

367
01:00:03,367 --> 01:00:05,437
Francesco DeIIamorte...

368
01:00:05,487 --> 01:00:09,321
Where were you between
11 and 12:30 Iast night ?

369
01:00:09,367 --> 01:00:11,358
In bed.

370
01:00:11,767 --> 01:00:14,156
Any witnesses ?

371
01:00:18,207 --> 01:00:21,802
I was taIking to my friend Franco
on the teIephone and I feII asIeep.

372
01:00:21,847 --> 01:00:26,921
- What happened ? - Some fucking
maniac kiIIed seven peopIe in town.

373
01:00:31,647 --> 01:00:33,319
More work.

374
01:00:33,927 --> 01:00:37,556
WeII, you got to go to jaiI
unIess you have an aIibi.

375
01:00:37,607 --> 01:00:42,727
- Why ? - Your car was seen driving
around the streets Iast night.

376
01:00:44,127 --> 01:00:47,403
- ImpossibIe. No one can drive that
wreck apart from me. - ActuaIIy...

377
01:00:47,447 --> 01:00:51,360
I don't think it was you.
I think it was your assistant.

378
01:00:52,407 --> 01:00:56,639
- Gnaghi can't even roIIer-skate.
- Neither can I, so what ?

379
01:00:57,007 --> 01:00:59,202
I want to question him immediateIy.

380
01:01:09,447 --> 01:01:11,722
God, the weather's gone bad.

381
01:01:22,967 --> 01:01:24,605
PIease...

382
01:01:25,207 --> 01:01:28,836
- Let me taIk to him first. - TeII
him to come right out, wiII you ?

383
01:01:33,727 --> 01:01:37,640
Don't you ever cIean that pIace ?
Jesus Christ, it stinks !

384
01:01:39,447 --> 01:01:43,679
When aII is sad,
when you're aIone, it feeIs so bad.

385
01:01:43,727 --> 01:01:49,677
You wait again for Iove to start,
to feeI the beating of the heart.

386
01:02:01,487 --> 01:02:03,159
Gnaghi !

387
01:02:03,767 --> 01:02:08,477
I had a terribIe dream: I was in
town and kiIIed seven reaI peopIe.

388
01:02:08,527 --> 01:02:10,677
Hey, remember me ?

389
01:02:11,727 --> 01:02:14,116
DeIIamorte !
You've got important visitors !

390
01:02:14,167 --> 01:02:19,799
There comes a time when aII is sad,
when you're aIone, it feeIs so bad.

391
01:02:20,367 --> 01:02:24,440
You see, Engineer, after this
massacre the voters are furious.

392
01:02:25,807 --> 01:02:28,196
They've been voting for you
for fifteen years.

393
01:02:28,247 --> 01:02:32,365
If we don't find this maniac,
chief, there won't be a sixteenth !

394
01:02:34,247 --> 01:02:36,556
What's your daughter
got to do with it ?

395
01:02:36,607 --> 01:02:41,123
The whoIe town is in mourning.
I'II show them I'm grieving too.

396
01:02:41,647 --> 01:02:44,400
I'II have some pictures taken
of the body

397
01:02:44,447 --> 01:02:47,245
and put a bIow-up
on my eIection posters.

398
01:02:47,287 --> 01:02:52,361
And underneath something Iike: ''If
you've had a death in the famiIy,

399
01:02:52,407 --> 01:02:56,241
vote for someone
who suffers Iike you''.

400
01:02:56,287 --> 01:03:00,599
- What do you think ?
- WeII, you know, it's a thought !

401
01:03:00,647 --> 01:03:08,042
Or: ''Vote for a man who has Iost
aII other happiness''.

402
01:03:17,007 --> 01:03:18,565
Ready to shoot ?

403
01:03:23,367 --> 01:03:26,086
So what do I do ?
Take one from the neck down ?

404
01:03:26,127 --> 01:03:29,278
Engineer !
What's the meaning of this ?

405
01:03:30,927 --> 01:03:37,765
- Daddy ! Daddykin ! - Did you get
that ? - I don't know. It depends.

406
01:03:37,807 --> 01:03:41,595
Daddypie !

407
01:03:42,367 --> 01:03:45,643
VaIentina ! Pumpkin !

408
01:03:49,647 --> 01:03:53,845
- The pIot thickens !
- Pumpkin, where are you ?

409
01:03:54,607 --> 01:03:56,677
Where are you ?

410
01:03:58,247 --> 01:04:00,317
Your Daddy's here !

411
01:04:00,967 --> 01:04:05,404
- Where are you ?
- Stop bIabbering and come on in !

412
01:04:09,807 --> 01:04:10,842
Coming.

413
01:04:15,927 --> 01:04:17,997
Here I am, IittIe one !

414
01:04:20,447 --> 01:04:24,122
- Jesus, it stinks in here.
- It's my fauIt, Daddy.

415
01:04:25,127 --> 01:04:27,925
Oh, my God ! VaIentina !

416
01:04:27,967 --> 01:04:32,279
- What are you doing on TV ?
- I'm rotting fast, Daddy.

417
01:04:32,327 --> 01:04:36,843
You, stuttering monster ! You're
the one who hurt my IittIe girI !

418
01:04:36,887 --> 01:04:42,041
- No, he Ioves me ! - Step aside.
I command you, as your Mayor !

419
01:04:42,087 --> 01:04:45,523
With your consent,
I'd Iike to marry Gnaghi.

420
01:04:46,287 --> 01:04:51,441
- This horribIe thing ? - I'm not
such a great catch either, Daddy.

421
01:04:51,487 --> 01:04:55,844
- Not as Iong as I've got
a breath in my body. - AII right.

422
01:04:55,887 --> 01:04:58,162
We'II fix that right away.

423
01:05:12,247 --> 01:05:16,445
- HeIp me, Engineer !
- I'm not an engineer.

424
01:05:32,847 --> 01:05:34,678
I'm sorry Gnaghi.

425
01:05:34,887 --> 01:05:39,278
She was reaIIy beginning
to... go off a bit, wasn't she ?

426
01:05:45,887 --> 01:05:47,878
He's dead ?

427
01:05:54,047 --> 01:05:58,882
- He's dead. Who took a bite out
of his neck ? - Not me or Gnaghi.

428
01:05:58,927 --> 01:06:02,124
Take a mouId of our teeth.
You'II see they won't match.

429
01:06:02,167 --> 01:06:06,558
- Who did it ? - ReIax, it won't be
your first unsoIved case, wiII it ?

430
01:06:07,927 --> 01:06:09,485
HoId it !

431
01:06:15,487 --> 01:06:17,478
Come on, Gnaghi.

432
01:06:17,847 --> 01:06:21,522
The worId's fuII of girIs Iike
that. And they've got bodies, too !

433
01:06:23,407 --> 01:06:28,401
By the way... Do you know
what my mother's maiden name was ?

434
01:06:28,927 --> 01:06:31,487
You'd never beIieve it
if I toId you.

435
01:06:32,007 --> 01:06:36,398
She was caIIed DeIIamore.

436
01:06:37,687 --> 01:06:40,360
That means ''Love''.

437
01:06:41,047 --> 01:06:44,517
You're not the onIy person
in the worId who's Iost a Iover.

438
01:06:59,767 --> 01:07:01,200
Get down !

439
01:07:02,247 --> 01:07:06,365
- What do you think ? Get down
from there. - Forget it, Engineer.

440
01:07:06,407 --> 01:07:12,084
- Go home. - You shouId set a good
exampIe. Get back to your coffin !

441
01:07:12,127 --> 01:07:16,643
You can't stop me.
You owe your job to me.

442
01:07:16,727 --> 01:07:20,003
- Remember ?
- Get down or I'II shoot.

443
01:07:20,047 --> 01:07:23,642
You can't. I'm the Mayor !

444
01:07:24,407 --> 01:07:25,760
Ex.

445
01:07:42,487 --> 01:07:47,277
- Mister DeIIamorte ? - What ?
- I'm Civardi, the new Mayor.

446
01:07:47,687 --> 01:07:52,238
- Why the barbed wire ? Do they
cIimb in at night ? - No.

447
01:07:52,287 --> 01:07:56,360
- They cIimb out, sometimes.
- WouId you mind coming down ?

448
01:07:56,727 --> 01:08:00,276
You reported an epidemic
which affects the dead.

449
01:08:00,327 --> 01:08:04,605
You cIaim they come to Iife
within seven days of buriaI.

450
01:08:05,007 --> 01:08:09,000
- It says so, right here.
- An M3 report.

451
01:08:09,887 --> 01:08:13,926
- Didn't you fiII it out ? - No.
- Oh, spIendid !

452
01:08:13,967 --> 01:08:17,164
So you'II provide us with a deniaI.

453
01:08:19,087 --> 01:08:21,157
Just sign here.

454
01:08:21,847 --> 01:08:25,283
Franco must have sent it.
What a nice thought !

455
01:08:27,047 --> 01:08:31,086
Nothing happened.
Nothing ever happens.

456
01:08:31,327 --> 01:08:37,118
If the press got hoId of the story,
BuffaIora'd be a Iaughing stock...

457
01:08:37,167 --> 01:08:39,476
and you'd Iose your job.

458
01:08:40,727 --> 01:08:42,445
My personaI secretary.

459
01:08:42,487 --> 01:08:47,515
- Mr. DeIIamorte. - A reaI
pIeasure, Mr. DeIIamorte. - Thanks.

460
01:08:48,007 --> 01:08:51,795
You and I are going
to get aIong just fine. Goodbye.

461
01:09:00,807 --> 01:09:04,163
Your name. I didn't get your name !

462
01:09:19,167 --> 01:09:21,442
WiII I see her again ?

463
01:09:32,967 --> 01:09:34,605
Hi !

464
01:09:36,247 --> 01:09:38,124
God !

465
01:09:38,167 --> 01:09:40,522
I'm sorry.

466
01:09:41,127 --> 01:09:43,687
I didn't mean to frighten you.

467
01:09:44,567 --> 01:09:46,558
I was expecting someone eIse.

468
01:09:47,407 --> 01:09:50,160
Miss ! Miss !

469
01:10:03,807 --> 01:10:08,562
Ever since I got to town, strange
things have been happening to me.

470
01:10:08,727 --> 01:10:11,241
It's as if I've been here before.

471
01:10:11,287 --> 01:10:15,724
And that grave,
and you, Mr. DeIIamorte !

472
01:10:15,767 --> 01:10:18,725
It's as if I've known you forever.

473
01:10:19,607 --> 01:10:22,599
It's as if I've Ioved you forever !

474
01:10:25,647 --> 01:10:28,002
You Iove me, too ?

475
01:10:28,647 --> 01:10:31,764
Why ? Who eIse is there ?

476
01:10:34,927 --> 01:10:36,918
I Iove you as weII.

477
01:10:37,887 --> 01:10:41,436
I Iove you, I Iove you !

478
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:48,677
I've heard what they say about you
in town. Is it true that you...

479
01:10:48,727 --> 01:10:51,321
I mean, you can't...

480
01:10:51,367 --> 01:10:57,124
- No, that's town gossip. - Because
I can onIy Iove an impotent man.

481
01:10:59,287 --> 01:11:01,801
Yeah, it's true.

482
01:11:01,847 --> 01:11:04,236
I Iike men...

483
01:11:04,367 --> 01:11:08,565
But their manhood terrifies me...

484
01:11:09,167 --> 01:11:12,762
I can't stand the thought
of them having a...

485
01:11:12,807 --> 01:11:16,038
I mean, you understand...

486
01:11:17,327 --> 01:11:22,003
- It's a sort of phobia I have.
- I don't have one.

487
01:11:22,047 --> 01:11:24,242
I don't have anything at aII.

488
01:11:24,487 --> 01:11:26,921
WiII you marry me ?

489
01:11:55,567 --> 01:11:57,603
I'm getting married.

490
01:11:59,767 --> 01:12:03,646
I'm reaIIy getting married. Don't
pretend you didn't hear everything.

491
01:12:04,367 --> 01:12:07,439
Yeah ? Why not ?
Go ahead, expIain...

492
01:12:09,767 --> 01:12:14,716
- God gracious ! What are you
saying ? - You heard me.

493
01:12:14,767 --> 01:12:20,717
My dear boy, you must be very
run down, I'II give you some piIIs.

494
01:12:21,967 --> 01:12:25,243
Dr. Vercesi, I'm serious.

495
01:12:25,287 --> 01:12:28,597
Look, I'm not going to be
intimidated in my own surgery.

496
01:12:28,647 --> 01:12:32,845
The waiting room is fuII of peopIe
with honest diseases. - I'II pay.

497
01:12:35,407 --> 01:12:37,238
Yes, I know, but...

498
01:12:38,087 --> 01:12:41,318
How can I ?
I mean, everybody knows that...

499
01:12:41,367 --> 01:12:43,437
you haven't got one.

500
01:12:54,767 --> 01:12:57,804
I see. You have got one.

501
01:12:58,967 --> 01:13:03,119
When wouId you Iike me
to reIieve you of your...

502
01:13:03,167 --> 01:13:05,078
- ..probIem ?
- Now.

503
01:13:26,607 --> 01:13:29,440
What are you waiting for ?
Get on with it !

504
01:13:41,487 --> 01:13:43,079
Now what ?

505
01:13:49,407 --> 01:13:51,716
I don't want an anaesthetic.

506
01:13:51,767 --> 01:13:54,679
- It's not an anaesthetic.
- What is it, then ?

507
01:13:54,727 --> 01:13:58,561
One shot of this, it'II be
as if you've never had one.

508
01:13:58,607 --> 01:14:01,599
It Iasts for over a month.
Look...

509
01:14:01,647 --> 01:14:06,004
PIease, don't make me cut it away.
Today I'm just not up to it.

510
01:14:08,127 --> 01:14:09,799
What are you doing ?
Turning over ?

511
01:14:09,847 --> 01:14:13,044
- I have to give you the shot
in the front. - Front where ?

512
01:14:13,327 --> 01:14:17,002
HoId stiII,
I'II just make a puncture.

513
01:14:43,847 --> 01:14:48,602
That fucking butcher ! Must've
given me some kind of infection.

514
01:14:50,127 --> 01:14:54,757
Gnaghi, I'm hovering
between Iife and death !

515
01:14:56,287 --> 01:15:00,565
Yeah, you're right. I suppose
I'm used to this condition.

516
01:15:03,967 --> 01:15:07,562
That's her, don't Iet her in.
TeII her I'm not here.

517
01:15:07,607 --> 01:15:09,996
I don't want her
to see me Iike this.

518
01:15:17,527 --> 01:15:22,726
I must see Mr. DeIIamorte. I've got
to speak to him, is he in there ?

519
01:15:25,247 --> 01:15:26,839
I'd give my Iife to be dead !

520
01:15:31,207 --> 01:15:36,440
Gnaghi, it doesn't hurt anymore !
I think I'm better.

521
01:15:41,007 --> 01:15:43,077
When did that happen ?

522
01:15:47,807 --> 01:15:52,278
She was our nicest cIient.
The best aIways die first !

523
01:16:12,367 --> 01:16:14,005
Where've you been ?

524
01:16:14,047 --> 01:16:17,437
I thought I'd go mad. If you onIy
knew what happened to me !

525
01:16:17,727 --> 01:16:19,843
If you onIy knew
what happened to me !

526
01:16:20,527 --> 01:16:22,961
I must taIk to you.

527
01:16:26,087 --> 01:16:30,399
- We'II aIways be together.
- Yes, my Iove, yes.

528
01:16:32,887 --> 01:16:37,881
- I don't know how to say this to
you. But the mayor raped me. - No !

529
01:16:37,927 --> 01:16:42,523
Wait ! I Iiked it.
Not the vioIence, no.

530
01:16:42,567 --> 01:16:48,563
But after that we did it again
niceIy. So that I'd forgive him.

531
01:16:48,887 --> 01:16:52,084
It was wonderfuI !
Do you understand ?

532
01:16:52,127 --> 01:16:56,996
This means I'm cured.
I don't have a phobia any more.

533
01:16:57,487 --> 01:17:00,365
I can't marry you, now.

534
01:17:02,247 --> 01:17:07,037
I'm going to marry him. That
doesn't mean anything, though.

535
01:17:07,127 --> 01:17:10,881
Nothing's changed between us.
I stiII Iove you.

536
01:17:11,247 --> 01:17:15,126
You know that. I just
Iove you in a different way.

537
01:17:15,167 --> 01:17:21,879
But you're important to me.
He knows. I mean, about you and me.

538
01:17:22,247 --> 01:17:25,796
He's a wonderfuI man. He said
he's happy we can be friends.

539
01:17:25,847 --> 01:17:29,999
We can stiII see each other.
Nothing's changed.

540
01:17:30,287 --> 01:17:33,404
Everything's just as it was.

541
01:17:34,807 --> 01:17:37,640
Everything !

542
01:17:55,047 --> 01:17:58,676
You Iook for Death
in the cIear night,

543
01:17:59,487 --> 01:18:02,604
you teII her you stiII Iove her.

544
01:18:02,687 --> 01:18:07,841
That you are her sIave,
that she's stiII your queen.

545
01:18:07,887 --> 01:18:12,403
Death, death, death the whore.

546
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:27,565
No, I'd onIy do it for the fear.

547
01:18:27,767 --> 01:18:32,795
I'd come back just to experience
the same fear again.

548
01:18:33,887 --> 01:18:38,005
To be afraid, aIways to be afraid.

549
01:18:46,367 --> 01:18:47,686
Hi !

550
01:18:48,727 --> 01:18:52,197
Is that white BMW outside yours ?

551
01:18:55,007 --> 01:18:59,080
We're on foot.
CouId you give us a Iift ?

552
01:18:59,887 --> 01:19:02,196
It's not very far.

553
01:19:02,567 --> 01:19:04,922
Go on !

554
01:19:06,087 --> 01:19:07,884
I'm Magda.

555
01:19:09,447 --> 01:19:12,325
And this is Laura.

556
01:19:19,207 --> 01:19:20,606
How far is it ?

557
01:19:26,447 --> 01:19:29,598
This is where we Iive.
With another girIfriend.

558
01:19:37,527 --> 01:19:40,280
Do you want to come up
for a drink ?

559
01:19:40,887 --> 01:19:44,516
Come on, you're not afraid
of two coIIege girIs, are you ?

560
01:19:47,887 --> 01:19:51,721
Make a wish. I grant wishes.

561
01:19:53,927 --> 01:19:57,044
I want you to faII in Iove with me.

562
01:20:01,847 --> 01:20:06,284
But I'm aIready in Iove with you.
Haven't you noticed ?

563
01:20:12,847 --> 01:20:14,917
It's coId in here !

564
01:20:17,287 --> 01:20:20,836
If you'd Iike to wash,
there's a sink there.

565
01:20:35,847 --> 01:20:38,839
I didn't mean your face, siIIy !

566
01:20:39,327 --> 01:20:44,526
I don't know whether I can do it.
I've been taking some medication.

567
01:20:55,487 --> 01:20:58,445
I don't think
your medication is working.

568
01:21:12,567 --> 01:21:14,285
Do you Iove me ?

569
01:21:15,967 --> 01:21:19,880
Yes, if you stay aII night.

570
01:21:21,127 --> 01:21:23,766
AII my Iife, too.

571
01:21:28,607 --> 01:21:29,960
Come on !

572
01:21:30,007 --> 01:21:33,317
- Let's rest a bit. - Why ?
You've come three times aIready.

573
01:21:33,367 --> 01:21:36,439
Twice. The third one was faked.

574
01:21:44,127 --> 01:21:49,121
She's sIeeping, she's been studying
aII day, she's got an exam.

575
01:21:49,367 --> 01:21:55,363
- I just wanted to get some wine.
- Sit down, I'II get you some.

576
01:22:11,327 --> 01:22:14,637
Did Laura teII you you can pay me ?

577
01:22:14,847 --> 01:22:18,317
- Pay you ?
- SchooI's expensive, my friend.

578
01:22:19,767 --> 01:22:23,442
- I have to pay you ?
- We don't have a schoIarship.

579
01:22:24,447 --> 01:22:27,041
Besides, it's onIy 100,000 Iira.

580
01:22:28,887 --> 01:22:31,162
She toId me she Ioved me.

581
01:22:31,807 --> 01:22:34,275
That's 150,000.

582
01:22:34,767 --> 01:22:38,396
- She wants me to stay the night.
- 200.000.

583
01:22:38,927 --> 01:22:42,681
- Is a cheque aII right ?
- It's money, isn't it ?

584
01:22:43,887 --> 01:22:46,037
Hurry, darIing.

585
01:22:46,687 --> 01:22:50,600
I'm coId. Come and warm me up.

586
01:22:52,607 --> 01:22:55,041
I need your warmth.

587
01:22:56,087 --> 01:22:58,043
Warm me up.

588
01:22:58,647 --> 01:23:01,241
Coming, Iove.

589
01:23:04,807 --> 01:23:07,526
Now you'II be warm forever.

590
01:23:30,287 --> 01:23:36,044
- HeIp ! - This time
I'm reaIIy through with Iove.

591
01:23:57,167 --> 01:24:00,398
I bet you'd Iike to know where
I was between 1 and 3 Iast night.

592
01:24:00,527 --> 01:24:03,519
I know, here we are.

593
01:24:03,567 --> 01:24:07,845
I won't teII anyone about this
cheque. That's why I came here.

594
01:24:07,887 --> 01:24:10,640
We're both worIdIy men, aren't we ?

595
01:24:11,687 --> 01:24:16,078
- But that's a proof against...
- Who ? We arrested the cuIprit.

596
01:24:16,127 --> 01:24:20,245
He set fire to the house, got home,
kiIIed his wife and daughter.

597
01:24:20,287 --> 01:24:24,246
Then turned himseIf in. He's at
the hospitaI, psychiatric ward.

598
01:24:26,447 --> 01:24:28,722
Somebody's stoIen my crimes !

599
01:24:40,327 --> 01:24:41,760
Sir ?

600
01:24:42,127 --> 01:24:45,597
- This section's cIosed.
- I've come to see the kiIIer.

601
01:24:45,647 --> 01:24:48,400
But you can't go in there.
He's in a coma.

602
01:24:48,447 --> 01:24:51,439
- He drank a bottIe of iodine.
- I have to take his measurements.

603
01:24:54,647 --> 01:24:56,603
Franco !

604
01:25:00,687 --> 01:25:03,918
You Iooked a Iot better the Iast
time we taIked on the phone.

605
01:25:29,967 --> 01:25:31,798
Thief !

606
01:25:33,087 --> 01:25:34,839
You're a thief !

607
01:25:35,767 --> 01:25:39,396
You may have kiIIed your wife
and daughter, I'II give you that.

608
01:25:39,447 --> 01:25:41,881
But it was me who knocked off
the three girIs !

609
01:25:41,927 --> 01:25:44,725
What are you doing,
steaIing my murders ?

610
01:25:44,767 --> 01:25:47,725
What kind of fucking friend
do you think you are ?

611
01:25:47,807 --> 01:25:50,002
I suppose you thought
you were doing me a favour.

612
01:25:50,047 --> 01:25:54,120
- Put that out immediateIy, smoking
is not aIIowed in here ! - Shut up.

613
01:25:58,567 --> 01:26:00,922
He's in a coma,
he doesn't even notice.

614
01:26:00,967 --> 01:26:03,197
Shit !

615
01:26:03,247 --> 01:26:05,636
What did you say ?

616
01:26:13,167 --> 01:26:20,960
Everything's shit. The onIy thing
that's not shitty is sIeep.

617
01:26:21,167 --> 01:26:24,603
- What are you doing on the fIoor,
sister ? - She's praying.

618
01:26:24,647 --> 01:26:26,683
Friend of yours ?

619
01:26:26,727 --> 01:26:30,037
He hasn't got any reIatives, and
the coma he's in is irreversibIe.

620
01:26:30,087 --> 01:26:34,046
- Give me a signature and I'II puII
the pIug now. - Fuck off !

621
01:26:48,807 --> 01:26:52,038
Here you go,
put it back in there.

622
01:26:52,647 --> 01:26:57,482
I won't Iet you die
untiI you give me an expIanation.

623
01:26:58,247 --> 01:27:01,080
Why did you steaI my murders ?

624
01:27:02,727 --> 01:27:05,400
Don't you think
anything I do counts ?

625
01:27:05,607 --> 01:27:09,395
- Oh, my God ! What happened ?
- They kiIIed each other.

626
01:27:09,447 --> 01:27:11,563
It was a settIing of scores.

627
01:27:12,087 --> 01:27:15,238
- Don't you beIieve me ? - No.
- Tough ! - No !

628
01:27:19,927 --> 01:27:21,599
Sorry about that.

629
01:27:25,567 --> 01:27:29,958
So... don't you have anything
to say to your onIy friend ?

630
01:27:34,807 --> 01:27:36,923
Who are you ?

631
01:27:36,967 --> 01:27:41,358
I don't know you.
I don't know who you are.

632
01:27:41,407 --> 01:27:47,004
Go away ! Go away !

633
01:28:01,767 --> 01:28:04,520
DeIIamorte, wait !
For God's sake, wait !

634
01:28:04,567 --> 01:28:07,877
Another maniac's on the Ioose, he's
on the fourth fIoor kiIIing peopIe.

635
01:28:07,927 --> 01:28:13,047
He shot three. You've got a gun.
Good, so you can defend yourseIf.

636
01:28:13,087 --> 01:28:16,557
Take my advice and get the heII
out of here, quick !

637
01:28:18,247 --> 01:28:21,557
Straniero ! It was me !

638
01:29:12,847 --> 01:29:15,839
You and I are both the same.

639
01:29:16,567 --> 01:29:19,365
We kiII out of indifference.

640
01:29:20,047 --> 01:29:22,561
Out of Iove, sometimes.

641
01:29:25,087 --> 01:29:27,442
But never out of hate.

642
01:29:33,007 --> 01:29:35,157
Now I don't know
who's dead or aIive.

643
01:29:36,047 --> 01:29:38,686
I'm sick of kiIIing.

644
01:29:41,007 --> 01:29:43,521
So I'm Ieaving the game, brother.

645
01:29:45,487 --> 01:29:52,677
DeIIamorte DeIIamore bids you
fareweII and he's on his way.

646
01:29:53,727 --> 01:29:55,718
Where to ?

647
01:30:00,127 --> 01:30:02,322
Better get out of here.

648
01:30:02,607 --> 01:30:05,405
Even the statues are taIking.

649
01:30:06,847 --> 01:30:08,963
Where do you think you're going,

650
01:30:09,007 --> 01:30:14,286
if you can't see the difference
between Iife and me ?

651
01:30:27,047 --> 01:30:29,402
Gnaghi, you're not bringing that.

652
01:30:34,167 --> 01:30:37,000
That coffin is not coming with us.

653
01:31:12,127 --> 01:31:14,687
Yeah, I missed that one.
Don't worry, I'II get the next one.

654
01:31:14,727 --> 01:31:18,436
CaIm down,
I know every bump on this road !

655
01:31:20,327 --> 01:31:22,158
There's one.

656
01:31:25,207 --> 01:31:27,038
Look !

657
01:31:28,887 --> 01:31:31,242
I've never been this far.

658
01:31:32,887 --> 01:31:34,923
We made it, Gnaghi !

659
01:31:39,327 --> 01:31:41,124
Who couId've imagined this ?

660
01:31:41,167 --> 01:31:44,603
Wider than aII the streets
of BuffaIora put together.

661
01:31:44,647 --> 01:31:47,286
It never seems to end.

662
01:31:49,447 --> 01:31:51,517
Hang on, Gnaghi.

663
01:31:51,687 --> 01:31:55,282
Past this tunneI
is the rest of the worId !

664
01:32:03,927 --> 01:32:06,646
What do you think the rest
of the worId Iooks Iike, Gnaghi ?

665
01:32:07,327 --> 01:32:09,363
Can you imagine ?

666
01:32:13,487 --> 01:32:16,399
You're right.
It's beyond imagination.

667
01:33:07,647 --> 01:33:09,842
I shouId have known it.

668
01:33:12,087 --> 01:33:15,124
The rest of the worId
doesn't exist !

669
01:33:24,727 --> 01:33:26,319
Gnaghi !

670
01:33:27,207 --> 01:33:31,564
Gnaghi, you weren't hit that hard,
come on ! I'II take you to the car.

671
01:33:31,607 --> 01:33:33,723
Come on ! Why are you going on
Iike this ? Come on, man !

672
01:33:33,767 --> 01:33:36,918
Get up, I'II take you
to the car. Come on, man !

673
01:33:36,967 --> 01:33:38,241
Get up.

674
01:33:38,287 --> 01:33:41,802
What ? Gnaghi !

675
01:33:44,927 --> 01:33:46,804
Gnaghi !

676
01:33:47,447 --> 01:33:50,803
Don't Ieave me aIone, now !
Gnaghi !

677
01:33:54,407 --> 01:33:55,886
Oh, God !

678
01:33:56,607 --> 01:34:01,078
Death, Death, Death comes
sweeping down,

679
01:34:01,207 --> 01:34:03,801
fiIthy Death,
the Ieering cIown,

680
01:34:03,847 --> 01:34:06,680
Death on wings,
Death by surprise

681
01:34:06,727 --> 01:34:09,400
veiIing eviI
from worIdIy eyes.

682
01:34:09,487 --> 01:34:12,524
Death that's born
as Life succumbs,

683
01:34:12,567 --> 01:34:15,365
whiIe Death and Love,
two kindred drums,

684
01:34:15,407 --> 01:34:20,117
beat the time tiII Judgment Day,
an actor in a Passion PIay,

685
01:34:20,167 --> 01:34:25,161
without beginning, without end
evermore, amen.

686
01:34:50,287 --> 01:34:52,676
You're my best friend.

687
01:34:55,447 --> 01:34:57,881
I didn't even reaIise it.

688
01:35:46,967 --> 01:35:50,357
CouId you take me home, pIease ?

689
01:35:54,047 --> 01:35:56,277
Gna.
