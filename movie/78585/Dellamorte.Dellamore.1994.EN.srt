1
00:00:36,349 --> 00:00:38,017
- Hello?
- It's me.

2
00:00:38,018 --> 00:00:40,649
Oh, am I bothering you, Francesco?

3
00:00:40,849 --> 00:00:43,840
No, don't worry, I had to get
out of the shower some time.

4
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,535
Hold on a minute, Franco...

5
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,900
You were saying, Franco?

6
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,310
No, no, nothing. Just
calling to see how you doing.

7
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,400
You know how things are...

8
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,400
...life goes on.

9
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,366
Gnaghi!

10
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,518
I've been shouting at
you for hours. Gnaghi!

11
00:02:37,647 --> 00:02:39,668
He's Ghigini, the surveyor.

12
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,408
- 12th row, 3rd grave, right?
- Gna.

13
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,600
Grave three.

14
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,487
Here we go.

15
00:03:00,272 --> 00:03:01,990
I know you've heard this before,

16
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,400
but this time,

17
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,400
my dear Ghigini,

18
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,604
it is forever.

19
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,200
Rest in peace!

20
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,262
Oh, my back...

21
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,571
What a waste of good marble.

22
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:26,045
Never looks right when you fix it.

23
00:03:26,245 --> 00:03:28,036
All this fancy packaging.

24
00:03:28,178 --> 00:03:30,700
I don' know why they don't
just cover the graves with dirt.

25
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,406
The gun! I forgot the fucking gun!

26
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:24,675
- Ea...t!
- Gnaghi,

27
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,877
give me the spade! Gnaghi!

28
00:04:27,077 --> 00:04:28,619
give me the fucking spade!

29
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,500
There we go.

30
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,038
You handle the rest Gnaghi.

31
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,739
My name is Francesco Dellamorte.

32
00:04:50,963 --> 00:04:52,207
Weird name, isn't it?

33
00:04:52,407 --> 00:04:53,700
Francis Of Death.

34
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,100
Saint Francis Of Death.

35
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:58,400
I often thought of having it changed.

36
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,353
Andrea Dellamorte would
be nicer, for example.

37
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,275
I'm the watchman of
the Buffalora cemetery,

38
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,700
I don't know how the epidemic started,

39
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,200
All I know is that some people,
on the 7th night after their death

40
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,000
come back to life.

41
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,400
I call them "Returners",

42
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,100
but frankly I can't understand
why they're so anxious to return.

43
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,555
The only way to get rid
of them once and for all,

44
00:05:20,755 --> 00:05:22,353
is to split their heads open.

45
00:05:22,553 --> 00:05:25,665
A spade'll do it, but a
Dum-Dum bullet is best.

46
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,759
Come and have a glass of wine.

47
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:34,500
Is this the beginning of an invasion?
Does it happen in all cemeteries,

48
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,400
or is Buffalora just an exception?

49
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,038
Who knows? And in the end, who cares?

50
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,813
I'm just doing my job.

51
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,491
Good morning engineer.
How are you doing today?

52
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,700
Fine, Miss Chiaromondo. And you?

53
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,600
The cemetery is open, isn't it?

54
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,600
For you, any time.

55
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,000
Hello cutie. Here...

56
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,200
How are you?

57
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,534
He's happy. He likes
it when the sun shines.

58
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,200
I'm not an engineer...

59
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,600
...and you are no cutie.

60
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,500
Poor Gnaghi, on his ID card it reads:

61
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,500
"Distinctive physical marks: all".

62
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,900
He has a real passion for dead leaves,

63
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,727
can't stand it when the
wind blows them away...

64
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,622
Oh well,

65
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,953
we all do what we can
not to think about life.

66
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,900
The most beautiful living
woman I have ever seen!

67
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,200
Will I see her again?

68
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,359
I just came to water the flowers
on your poor father's grave.

69
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,461
Husband.

70
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,500
How long has he been dead?

71
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,476
Two weeks.

72
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,356
- Thank goodness.
- What?

73
00:08:56,556 --> 00:09:00,075
- I mean, I'm very sorry.
- Have you no respect for pain?

74
00:09:00,275 --> 00:09:01,689
Well, you know how these
things are... You see:

75
00:09:02,121 --> 00:09:05,295
- in time, pain heals.
- It's not healing a bit.

76
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,700
He was wonderful,

77
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,100
he was a wonderful lover, incredible,

78
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,952
tireless.

79
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,000
He was fantastic!

80
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,315
I messed it all up,

81
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,900
I've lost her.

82
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,930
Will I see her again?

83
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,600
Hey, Franco!

84
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,500
Franco is the only living person

85
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,200
who even calls me. Now and
then I stop by his office

86
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,600
to remind myself what he looks like.

87
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,900
You can't live on memories alone.

88
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,700
It's for you. Sign as usual.

89
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,821
- Have you got a pen?
- No.

90
00:10:34,021 --> 00:10:35,837
Hold on a sec, here we are.

91
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,700
Have you had any visits last nights?

92
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,300
A couple, yes.

93
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:50,000
All this extra work! It's
much if the pay me any more.

94
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,726
Tell the Mayor...

95
00:10:51,926 --> 00:10:55,100
Oh, tell the Mayor then what?
They'd close the cemetery.

96
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,008
Good-bye job and
good-bye house!

97
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:59,266
Come on, who do you
think would believe you?

98
00:10:59,366 --> 00:11:01,230
Listen, I don't care if
you don't believe me Franco,

99
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:03,053
you're not the one who pays me!

100
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,463
I believe you,

101
00:11:04,663 --> 00:11:06,644
I believe you, and you're right...

102
00:11:06,844 --> 00:11:08,535
- At least have him pay the overtime.
- Good.

103
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:10,046
Well, let's go to the Mayor, then!

104
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,618
It's not that easy.

105
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:14,404
First you have to fill out an M3 form,

106
00:11:14,604 --> 00:11:17,200
report with an M3 form...

107
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,781
Forms...

108
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,700
I could speed things up there for you...

109
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,900
It's easier just to shoot them.

110
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,486
One M3 form!

111
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,100
Going to get our willies wet tonight?

112
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,000
Some of us, yeah.

113
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,700
Hell, at a certain point
in life, you realize

114
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,098
you know more dead people than living.

115
00:12:48,746 --> 00:12:51,489
Sorry about the other day, I was
a bit crass. I didn't mean to be.

116
00:12:51,689 --> 00:12:53,800
My name's Francesco Dellamorte.

117
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,300
You know, this is the
only job I could get

118
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,800
even with a degree in biology.

119
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,400
Anyway we all end up here
sooner or later, don't we?

120
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,000
I've got a great little
house... Want to see it?

121
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,000
I don't live alone, I've
got a helper, Gnaghi.

122
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,200
He's a real conversationist!

123
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,600
The cemetery's small, but
it's got a marvellous ossuary!

124
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,800
An ossuary...

125
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,800
I have never seen anything so...

126
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,700
exciting!

127
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,000
Neither have I.

128
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,100
It's like in my dreams!

129
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,200
This is my dream.

130
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,300
I couldn't ask for anything more.

131
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,200
Me neither.

132
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:33,000
You know, you've got
a real nice ossuary.

133
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,700
Thanks.

134
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,000
You will allow me to return, won't you?

135
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,800
You will allow me to kiss
you just once, won't you?

136
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,200
No.

137
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,200
Not like this.

138
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,681
Like this.

139
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,700
I must be faithful to
the memory of my husband!

140
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:29,053
I can't. I can't!

141
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,900
It's not my fault... It's this place.

142
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,460
I feel strange tremors.

143
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,975
It's not the cold...

144
00:15:39,175 --> 00:15:40,200
I'm not afraid...

145
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,833
This place wants me to...
It's forcing me to...

146
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:46,800
I don't want to!

147
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,600
I don't want to!

148
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,884
I can't! I can't!

149
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,473
Don't be afraid, it's just ignis fatuus.

150
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,800
Why here?

151
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,800
Why on your poor husband's grave?

152
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,371
I've never kept anything from him...

153
00:18:47,571 --> 00:18:49,900
We trusted each other implicitly.

154
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,800
He would have liked to know.

155
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,451
Well, if that's the case...

156
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,600
All these lights!

157
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,307
Let them watch.

158
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,740
What's better than watching
two lovers making love, hey?

159
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,926
Just to have a bit of privacy.

160
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,756
Sorry, but the lady wants stars only.

161
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:02,468
It's never been like
this before, with anybody.

162
00:21:02,668 --> 00:21:03,972
Only you.

163
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,300
No one will ever make us part.

164
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,999
Gnaghi! The gun!

165
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,600
I can explain! Listen to me,

166
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,400
you've always been so understanding!

167
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,443
That's life!

168
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,800
It's nothing my love,

169
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,300
you're fine.

170
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,758
Great,

171
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:49,465
just when I don't need it anymore.

172
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,198
Well don't just stand there!
Go call doctor Vercesi!

173
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,672
Go on, get the doctor!

174
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,253
Go on! Move!

175
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,509
Nothing can separate us.

176
00:22:01,709 --> 00:22:03,863
I swear, nothing.

177
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,900
Nothing will separate us, will it?

178
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,800
Nothing, my love. Nothing.

179
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,656
Not even death?

180
00:22:22,856 --> 00:22:24,628
Not even death.

181
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:04,248
Dellamorte, are you
in there? Dellamorte!

182
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,000
Jesus! You scared me to death!

183
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,800
Were you looking for
me, Chief Straniero?

184
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,300
Yes, Dr. Vercesi called.
What happened last night?

185
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,582
Well you know. Why are
you asking me? She's dead.

186
00:23:25,782 --> 00:23:26,800
I know she's dead,

187
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,400
but how did that happen?

188
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,900
Her husband.

189
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,800
Sure! He came back from
the dead, he raped her,

190
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,400
then bit her to death.
Is that what he did?

191
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,000
No, he didn't rape her.

192
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,500
Oh, you always crack me up, you know!

193
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,500
Dr. Vercesi, are you spying on us?

194
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,300
No, I dropped this certificate.

195
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,300
Her heart stopped from fear, it
wasn't the bite that killed her.

196
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:50,216
She died while making...
well you know... doing it.

197
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,900
You know what that means, my boy?

198
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,347
I'll have to look somewhere else
for the creep who killed her!

199
00:23:55,547 --> 00:23:57,744
- You are no longer a suspect.
- Why not?

200
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,400
Well, you know what I mean.

201
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,363
Look, don't make me say it!

202
00:24:02,563 --> 00:24:05,346
Go on, you can say it. I
don't mind, I'm impotent!

203
00:24:05,546 --> 00:24:08,490
Don't use that word! A young
man like you, at your age...

204
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:09,400
Did she have any relatives?

205
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,797
No, no relatives, no friends.

206
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,813
Well, I have to say that...

207
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,866
Shit! This is definitely not my style!

208
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,952
- Can I keep her here?
- If you pay for the funeral, of course

209
00:24:24,152 --> 00:24:25,700
you can do whatever
the hell you want with her.

210
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
- Does that wrap it up, then?
- Yeah, except for a killer on the loose.

211
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,000
Care to join me for a cup of tea?

212
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,777
The weather's changing at last!

213
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,300
I can't forgive myself
for having lied to you:

214
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,600
I don't have a degree in biology,

215
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,600
I didn't even finish high school.

216
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,500
I haven't read more than
two books in my whole life:

217
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,400
one,

218
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,000
never finished,

219
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,200
and the other is the phone book.

220
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,700
I don't want her to become a Returner.

221
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,200
I don't want to see her again.

222
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,900
No!

223
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,000
Yes, my love!

224
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,559
No, don't make me do it!

225
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:15,900
But if you do it so well... so well!

226
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,600
Not to you!

227
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,289
It will be better with
me than with the others!

228
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,700
Gna!

229
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,000
You do it!

230
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:23,200
Well go on! If you finish
fast I'll buy you an ice-cream.

231
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,300
Gna!

232
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,500
- Here comes the Unforgiven.
- Who?

233
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,273
The Tombstone Mayor.

234
00:27:38,068 --> 00:27:41,500
The man whose dick's so
small he pees with tweezers.

235
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,378
He could become a
woman. That'd solve it!

236
00:27:46,578 --> 00:27:49,361
They are sewing them
back on in the States now.

237
00:27:49,767 --> 00:27:51,800
Yeah, they can stitch it right on,
if you've got one to start with.

238
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,700
Forget it, I started that rumour.

239
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,700
The more they laugh, the
further away they seem.

240
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
You can never be too different, Gnaghi.

241
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,000
Maybe you can.

242
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,800
Engineer!

243
00:28:03,961 --> 00:28:07,700
Engineer, engineer, come! Have a seat!

244
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,800
Well well well, what a surprise!

245
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:14,499
Yes! It's a miracle
seeing you here, engineer!

246
00:28:14,699 --> 00:28:17,158
It's a miracle seeing
you here, Mr. Mayor.

247
00:28:17,475 --> 00:28:21,500
So, how are things down at
our cemetery? How are things?

248
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,200
Well how do you think things are?

249
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,400
Population's shrinking.

250
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,400
You're lucky, my dear engineer!

251
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,700
You just can't imagine how
things are at the Town Hall.

252
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,529
Now that the elections are upon us,

253
00:28:32,729 --> 00:28:35,042
it is chaos, right, inspector?

254
00:28:35,242 --> 00:28:38,226
Yeah, it's a thrill for all,
nobody wants to lose their job.

255
00:28:38,227 --> 00:28:40,011
I was hoping for a New Deal...

256
00:28:40,056 --> 00:28:42,237
Daddy, what's this?

257
00:28:42,437 --> 00:28:44,783
This is my assistant Gnaghi.

258
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:51,385
He's sweet!

259
00:28:51,668 --> 00:28:53,267
Will you buy him, daddy?

260
00:28:54,628 --> 00:28:57,854
That's great, it even knows how to cry!

261
00:28:58,054 --> 00:28:59,608
Gnaghi, don't stay so close to her.

262
00:28:59,808 --> 00:29:01,471
Could you move over, darling?

263
00:29:01,671 --> 00:29:03,347
Would you tell your
daughter to move over please?

264
00:29:03,383 --> 00:29:04,397
Yes of course.

265
00:29:04,597 --> 00:29:06,171
Sometimes Gnaghi gets a little bit excited...

266
00:29:06,371 --> 00:29:08,424
Oh, I'm sure he's
charming. Now, where was I?

267
00:29:14,374 --> 00:29:16,657
What's he doing? Dancing?

268
00:29:16,857 --> 00:29:19,134
No, no, he's just about to...

269
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,510
What the hell are you doing Valentina?

270
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:26,646
He threw up on me, Claudio!

271
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,032
Oh, a new fact!

272
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,934
Would you like to go for a ride?

273
00:29:30,693 --> 00:29:32,491
I knew you'd understand!

274
00:29:33,446 --> 00:29:34,578
Take off!

275
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,686
By the way, one of these days

276
00:29:41,886 --> 00:29:43,780
I have to talk to you
about the cemetery.

277
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:49,043
The youth of today...
They're so... emotional.

278
00:29:57,031 --> 00:29:58,715
Come on, Gnaghi! Get in, for God's sake!

279
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,980
Don't do this, just get in the car!

280
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,983
It's not the end of the world,
It didn't even bother her!

281
00:30:04,183 --> 00:30:06,464
She understood it was just a
demonstration of your affection.

282
00:30:06,664 --> 00:30:10,237
Anyway, it's not the first time
you threw up over a woman, is it?

283
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,194
Come on, Gnaghi, get in!

284
00:30:17,135 --> 00:30:19,666
Look, first love doesn't count.

285
00:30:19,866 --> 00:30:21,797
It's last love that counts!

286
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:31,880
Nobody came today.

287
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,764
I was a bit bored,

288
00:30:33,964 --> 00:30:37,172
not even the admiral...
he's just disappeared!

289
00:30:37,372 --> 00:30:39,950
Let's hope tomorrow, okay?

290
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:42,427
Yeah, come again and stay a while.

291
00:30:42,627 --> 00:30:46,839
Oh, he was such a
distinguished man, the admiral!

292
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,212
Always used to bring me, always,

293
00:30:50,412 --> 00:30:53,278
a touch of Sambuca.

294
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,825
Oh, come on Gnaghi!

295
00:31:27,425 --> 00:31:28,800
You'll get over, you'll see!

296
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,500
Time passes,

297
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,200
nothing seems the same...

298
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,900
It just gets worse.

299
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,000
God, is it ever difficult
trying to make you feel better!

300
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,900
What were you doing with the Mayor's
daughter anyway? She's only a child!

301
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,800
Gna!

302
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:57,300
Oh yeah, that's not true,
you are not a child, Gnaghi.

303
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,645
You're a year older than I am. Anyway...

304
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,200
One day,

305
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,100
you'll settle down with some...

306
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,600
poor creature like yourself.

307
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,852
In the meanwhile, why do you care?

308
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,800
They all end up here
sooner or later, Gnaghi.

309
00:32:16,564 --> 00:32:18,621
Often sooner than later.

310
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,500
Faster, open it up!

311
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,800
- If daddy could see us now!
- He'd kill me!

312
00:32:29,274 --> 00:32:30,400
Claudio!

313
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,385
- Off we go!
- Go!

314
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,900
Go! Go!

315
00:32:39,847 --> 00:32:41,011
Go!

316
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,200
- Hang on!
- Eat our dust!

317
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,100
Four motorcycles racing...

318
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,700
The Mayor's daughter is on one of them.

319
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,600
Her head was sliced right off.

320
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,300
They had to sew it back on the body.

321
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,400
The bikes crashed into
a bus loaded with scouts

322
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,400
on their way back from
a church-sponsored rally.

323
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,300
Slaughter of the innocents!

324
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,200
And they were all so young.

325
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:29,200
They felt their life was ahead of them,
but in fact they were already passing by.

326
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,100
Well, you've got your hands full!

327
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,900
Oh, more than you know!

328
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,800
Gnaghi, we're going to
need a lot of bullets.

329
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:43,700
# Never should have gone
out on the Boy Scout picnic,

330
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,200
# never should have, never
should have gone just then.

331
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,500
# Never should have gone
out on the Boy Scout picnic,

332
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:54,332
# Never should have, now
I'll never go again! #

333
00:33:54,516 --> 00:33:56,105
Claudio! Take me with you!

334
00:33:56,305 --> 00:33:58,900
Don't leave me all alone, Claudio!

335
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,800
Take me with you, my love!

336
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,100
Nasty tart!

337
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,800
My son wasn't with you!

338
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,900
He was promised to the Mayor's daughter!

339
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,500
- But he loved me!
- Liar!

340
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:13,100
He was mine, he loved me!

341
00:34:13,448 --> 00:34:16,337
- Only me!
- Have you no respect for a mother's pain?

342
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,700
We're born to die,

343
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,211
born merely to die.

344
00:34:21,411 --> 00:34:22,959
Do you remember?

345
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,500
Just yesterday,

346
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:27,000
she was alive, happy.

347
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,900
Do you remember?

348
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,700
Dear Gnaghi even threw up on her,

349
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,761
and she took it so well!

350
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,934
And now, she's gone...

351
00:34:37,134 --> 00:34:39,800
and right on the eve of the elections!

352
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,200
I better get the pickaxe and shovel.

353
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:46,100
Pumpkin, how could you do this to me?

354
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,600
Is it true as they say, that the
dead come back to life here at night?

355
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,000
Tell me the truth!

356
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,200
Hey! Who told you that?

357
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,259
Is it true or not? Is it true or not?

358
00:35:24,525 --> 00:35:25,700
What if it is?

359
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:28,300
I've got to see Claudio again!

360
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,700
I have to know whether
he loved me or her!

361
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,700
If I hear anything, I'll let you know.

362
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,300
No, wait...

363
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,000
Go away! I haven't got
time for the living!

364
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,500
Gnaghi?

365
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Gnaghi!

366
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,400
Gnaghi, they came back
sooner than we thought!

367
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,000
Gnaghi wake up!

368
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,100
Gnaghi, watch out!

369
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,400
Gnaghi,

370
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,897
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

371
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,200
Well, that's it, time's up and

372
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,519
I want you upstairs and
ready in five minutes! Okay?

373
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,300
Oh no, what's she doing here?

374
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,200
Visiting hours are over!

375
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:16,550
No one is going to
take me away from him!

376
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,450
Quick, get the fuck over here! Quick!

377
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:24,350
No, Claudio!

378
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:07,950
Claudio, take me with
you! Don't leave me!

379
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:10,425
Stupid cow!

380
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,442
Come on!

381
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:22,359
Wait! Wait!

382
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:28,655
Claudio please, take me with you!

383
00:41:28,905 --> 00:41:31,545
Tell me you only love me!

384
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:34,150
Please...

385
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:51,150
Claudio!

386
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:55,660
You only love me, right?

387
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:23,400
Damn! It always shoots to
the right when it's cold.

388
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:46,050
Gnaghi!

389
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:26,950
No, please don't! He's only eating me!

390
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:28,350
Move aside.

391
00:43:28,821 --> 00:43:31,899
Mind your business! I shall
be eaten by whoever I please!

392
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:34,597
This is my business. They pay me for it.

393
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,050
The living dead

394
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:52,173
and the dying living are all the same.

395
00:43:52,373 --> 00:43:54,731
Cut from the same cloth.

396
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:58,354
But disposing of dead
people is a public service,

397
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:00,733
whereas you're in all sorts of trouble

398
00:44:00,933 --> 00:44:03,864
if you kill someone
while they're still alive.

399
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:15,150
Wait!

400
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:34,050
This way they'll be together forever.

401
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:42,650
I'm sentimental.

402
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:04,150
Patience, Gnaghi.

403
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:06,650
In love, it's the waiting
that's the best part.

404
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:10,150
You have to learn how to wait.

405
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:28,450
- What's your name again?
- Gna!

406
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:30,275
Gnaghi.

407
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:37,031
I'm Valentina.

408
00:46:37,899 --> 00:46:40,052
Haven't I seen you before?

409
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:44,450
Oh yeah. Now I remember.

410
00:46:44,650 --> 00:46:46,850
You threw up on me. How sweet!

411
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:57,050
But I like shy boys.

412
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:00,000
And you never say no to a kiss.

413
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:01,200
Take advantage.

414
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:04,900
I'm certainly in no position
to refuse. Besides,

415
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:06,800
I don't think I'd refuse anyway.

416
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,705
False alarm!

417
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:21,600
It was only a cat.

418
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:32,600
No use you trying
to help me, little thing!

419
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,400
If I can't do it, imagine you...

420
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:38,400
Putting this skull together,

421
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:41,800
is one of the most difficult
things in the world.

422
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,600
You know, you really are
disgusting when you eat, Gnaghi.

423
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,200
Gna!

424
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:24,800
Yes, you're right. I suppose it all does
get mixed up in the stomach, in the end.

425
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:29,600
What is it?

426
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,400
That wasn't a cat!

427
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:51,700
We can't! I'm alive,

428
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,200
and you are dead.

429
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,500
I'm not prejudiced, my love.

430
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,800
I killed her!

431
00:53:23,503 --> 00:53:24,771
Gna!

432
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:30,700
I killed her!

433
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:40,100
I killed her.

434
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:44,700
The first time, when her husband
bit her, she wasn't really dead.

435
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,100
When she woke up, and I
shot her, she was alive.

436
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,900
I killed her.

437
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:53,300
I killed the only woman I ever loved.

438
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:55,700
I shot her with my eyes closed,

439
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,500
didn't aim for the head.

440
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:59,400
That's why she came back.

441
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
God, what an idiot!

442
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:05,300
Now, I'm infected too.

443
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:07,900
Will I be a Returner when I die?

444
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:11,200
Who knows if Gnaghi...

445
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:14,431
No, poor Gnaghi, he'd
never have the guts

446
00:54:14,631 --> 00:54:16,545
to crush my skull with a shovel.

447
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:22,079
I'm not dead, you idiot!
A bite can't kill you!

448
00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:29,850
Good morning, engineer!

449
00:54:30,550 --> 00:54:32,750
Miss Chiaromondo, I'm not an engineer.

450
00:54:32,950 --> 00:54:35,968
Are you, or are you not
the watchman of the cemetery?

451
00:54:36,168 --> 00:54:37,662
Well, of course I am.

452
00:54:37,862 --> 00:54:40,728
You are therefore an engineer. By the way,

453
00:54:40,928 --> 00:54:45,615
which of these do you think
would be better on my tombstone?

454
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:52,259
Both.

455
00:54:52,459 --> 00:54:56,350
I like the opinion of
a handsome young man.

456
00:54:56,550 --> 00:54:58,350
Good-bye, engineer.

457
00:55:03,448 --> 00:55:06,380
- Gna!
- Good morning, cutie.

458
00:55:22,850 --> 00:55:24,650
But that's the phone book.

459
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:26,450
Are you crazy?

460
00:55:26,945 --> 00:55:29,297
That is my favourite reading!

461
00:55:31,163 --> 00:55:32,952
Gnaghi, just because
we've got the new ones

462
00:55:33,152 --> 00:55:36,835
doesn't mean to say we have to throw the
old ones away. These books are classics!

463
00:55:41,950 --> 00:55:43,250
Gnaghi!

464
00:55:43,450 --> 00:55:44,790
Gna!

465
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:14,455
Stop killing the dead.

466
00:56:14,850 --> 00:56:16,352
They're mine.

467
00:56:16,552 --> 00:56:19,674
If you don't want the
dead coming back to life...

468
00:56:19,950 --> 00:56:22,880
why don't you just kill the living,

469
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:24,250
shoot them in the head?

470
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:26,870
Are you listening to me?

471
00:56:42,886 --> 00:56:44,850
- Hello?
- Greetings from the Tomb oft the Town Hall.

472
00:56:45,050 --> 00:56:46,550
- Franco! How are you?
- Bored.

473
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:48,350
Am I disturbing you?

474
00:56:48,550 --> 00:56:50,050
No, you never disturb me.

475
00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:52,750
Just called to talk about the scandal.

476
00:56:52,950 --> 00:56:54,857
- Gnaghi, the door!
- All that crap.

477
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:55,950
What did you say?

478
00:56:58,450 --> 00:56:59,950
What the hell was that?

479
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:01,178
Nothing, I'm...

480
00:57:01,378 --> 00:57:02,567
- ...just working.
- What?

481
00:57:02,767 --> 00:57:05,367
You know, daily grind.
Nothing but the daily grind.

482
00:57:05,567 --> 00:57:07,950
You're telling me! Sometimes,
I feel like shooting myself.

483
00:57:10,050 --> 00:57:11,639
How's everything in your life?

484
00:57:11,839 --> 00:57:13,813
How are dear Mara and Cinzia?

485
00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:19,650
You know, sometimes I wonder
if they really exist, Franco.

486
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:26,816
I mean, you do have a wife
and a daughter, don't you?

487
00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:36,414
I only ask 'cause... sometimes
I think you've made it all up.

488
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:46,673
Franco, you do make me laugh!

489
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:53,050
You'll get out one day.

490
00:57:53,450 --> 00:57:57,950
Buffalora will be
nothing but a bad, bad memory.

491
00:57:58,250 --> 00:58:01,050
Yeah, or maybe not, if
only I could get unstuck...

492
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:03,650
I feel like a fly on fly paper.

493
00:58:04,450 --> 00:58:06,050
You'll see, Franco...

494
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:12,106
Mara is going to get tired of you,

495
00:58:13,550 --> 00:58:16,204
and Cinzia will grow up to hate you.

496
00:58:16,404 --> 00:58:18,150
Then you'll be free.

497
00:58:19,350 --> 00:58:22,450
Free to see what the rest
of the world looks like.

498
00:58:23,550 --> 00:58:26,450
What do you think the rest
of the world looks like?

499
00:58:27,450 --> 00:58:29,150
- The rest of the world?
- Uh-uh.

500
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:35,110
Who knows if the rest of
the world even exists...

501
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:48,050
Look who it is!

502
00:58:48,350 --> 00:58:49,550
Hey, Dellamorte, come here!

503
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:34,633
At times, I get ahead of my work.

504
00:59:35,752 --> 00:59:37,129
Work!

505
00:59:45,741 --> 00:59:47,150
Dellamorte!

506
00:59:50,883 --> 00:59:52,650
Dellamorte!

507
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:55,850
Gnaghi!

508
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:05,350
Francesco Dellamorte?

509
01:00:05,550 --> 01:00:08,850
Where were you between
11 and 12:30 last night?

510
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:10,650
In bed.

511
01:00:11,450 --> 01:00:13,137
Any witnesses?

512
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:21,750
I was talking to my friend Franco
on the telephone and I fell asleep.

513
01:00:22,150 --> 01:00:23,445
Why, what happened?

514
01:00:23,645 --> 01:00:26,307
Some fucking maniac
killed 7 people in town.

515
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:33,350
More work.

516
01:00:34,108 --> 01:00:37,126
Well, you got to go to jail,
unless you have an alibi!

517
01:00:37,350 --> 01:00:38,650
Why me?

518
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:43,048
Because your car was seen driving
around the streets last night, that's why.

519
01:00:44,350 --> 01:00:46,650
That's impossible, no one
can drive that wreck apart from me.

520
01:00:46,950 --> 01:00:49,588
Actually, I don't think it was you.

521
01:00:49,788 --> 01:00:51,629
I think it was your assistant.

522
01:00:52,350 --> 01:00:54,550
Gnaghi can't even roller-skate!

523
01:00:54,850 --> 01:00:56,550
Neither can I, so what?

524
01:00:57,050 --> 01:00:59,250
I want to question him immediately.

525
01:01:09,350 --> 01:01:11,750
God, the weather's gone bad.

526
01:01:22,850 --> 01:01:24,321
Please,

527
01:01:24,932 --> 01:01:26,050
let me talk to him first.

528
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:29,031
Just tell him to come
right out, will you?

529
01:01:33,850 --> 01:01:37,550
Don't you ever clean that
place? Jesus Christ, it stinks!

530
01:01:39,282 --> 01:01:43,482
# When all is sad, when you're
alone, it feels so bad.

531
01:01:43,608 --> 01:01:49,416
# You wait again for love to start,
to feel the beating of the heart. #

532
01:02:01,333 --> 01:02:03,201
Gnaghi!

533
01:02:04,048 --> 01:02:06,000
Gnaghi, I had a terrible dream last night,

534
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:09,053
 I dreamt I went to town
and killed 7 real people.

535
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:11,371
Hi, remember me?

536
01:02:11,892 --> 01:02:14,750
Dellamorte, you've
got important visitors!

537
01:02:20,232 --> 01:02:22,850
You'll understand, engineer, after this massacre,

538
01:02:23,050 --> 01:02:24,550
the voters are furious with me.

539
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:27,850
They've been voting
for you for 15 years.

540
01:02:28,150 --> 01:02:30,250
If I don't find this maniac, Straniero,

541
01:02:30,450 --> 01:02:32,350
there won't be a sixteenth.

542
01:02:34,289 --> 01:02:36,250
What's your daughter got to do with it?

543
01:02:36,350 --> 01:02:38,250
Now that the whole town is in mourning,

544
01:02:38,450 --> 01:02:41,539
I want to show them
that I'm grieving as well.

545
01:02:41,739 --> 01:02:44,167
I'll have some pictures
taken of the body

546
01:02:44,367 --> 01:02:46,950
and put a blow-up on
my election posters.

547
01:02:47,350 --> 01:02:49,050
And underneath, something like:

548
01:02:49,450 --> 01:02:52,050
"if you've had a death in the family,

549
01:02:52,450 --> 01:02:55,950
vote for someone who suffers like you."

550
01:02:56,175 --> 01:02:57,550
What do you think?

551
01:02:57,934 --> 01:03:00,450
Well, you know, it's a thought!

552
01:03:00,850 --> 01:03:02,850
Or: "Vote

553
01:03:03,150 --> 01:03:05,250
for a man who has lost

554
01:03:05,550 --> 01:03:08,550
all other happiness."

555
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:18,691
Ready to shoot?

556
01:03:23,350 --> 01:03:25,650
So what do I do? Take
one from the neck down?

557
01:03:25,924 --> 01:03:27,350
Engineer?

558
01:03:27,650 --> 01:03:29,450
What's the meaning of this?

559
01:03:31,150 --> 01:03:32,862
Daddy!

560
01:03:33,150 --> 01:03:34,550
Daddykin!

561
01:03:34,807 --> 01:03:35,750
Did you hear that?

562
01:03:35,950 --> 01:03:37,650
I don't know. It depends...

563
01:03:37,850 --> 01:03:39,650
Daddypie!

564
01:03:40,159 --> 01:03:41,943
Daddypooh!

565
01:03:42,250 --> 01:03:43,750
Valentina!

566
01:03:44,150 --> 01:03:45,650
Pumpkin!

567
01:03:49,550 --> 01:03:51,050
The plot thickens!

568
01:03:51,250 --> 01:03:53,673
Pumpkin, where are you?

569
01:03:54,650 --> 01:03:56,350
Where are you?

570
01:03:58,150 --> 01:04:00,050
Your Daddy's here!

571
01:04:00,950 --> 01:04:02,450
Where are you?

572
01:04:02,650 --> 01:04:05,050
Stop blabbering and come on in!

573
01:04:09,850 --> 01:04:11,260
Coming.

574
01:04:15,850 --> 01:04:17,750
Here I am, little one.

575
01:04:20,550 --> 01:04:22,150
Jesus, it stinks in here!

576
01:04:22,350 --> 01:04:23,350
It's my fault, daddy!

577
01:04:25,350 --> 01:04:27,150
Oh my God, Valentina!

578
01:04:27,650 --> 01:04:29,650
What are you doing on TV?

579
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:31,850
I'm rotting fast, Daddy!

580
01:04:32,050 --> 01:04:34,450
You, stuttering monster,

581
01:04:34,650 --> 01:04:36,450
you're the one who hurt my little girl!

582
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:38,450
No, he loves me!

583
01:04:38,850 --> 01:04:40,218
Step aside!

584
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:41,850
I command you, as your Mayor!

585
01:04:41,950 --> 01:04:44,550
With your consent, I'd
like to marry Gnaghi.

586
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:48,050
- This horrible thing?
- Gna!

587
01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:50,850
I'm not such a great
catch either, Daddy.

588
01:04:51,250 --> 01:04:53,950
Not as long, dear, as I've
got a breath in my body!

589
01:04:54,650 --> 01:04:57,450
Alright. We'll fix that right away!

590
01:05:12,171 --> 01:05:14,581
Help me, engineer!

591
01:05:14,781 --> 01:05:16,670
I'm not an engineer!

592
01:05:32,937 --> 01:05:34,465
I'm sorry Gnaghi,

593
01:05:34,935 --> 01:05:36,565
she really was beginning to...

594
01:05:36,765 --> 01:05:39,046
go off a bit on that, wasn't she?

595
01:05:45,450 --> 01:05:46,550
He's dead?

596
01:05:53,650 --> 01:05:54,750
He's dead.

597
01:05:55,050 --> 01:05:56,945
Who took a bite out of his neck?

598
01:05:57,145 --> 01:05:58,520
Well, not me or Gnaghi,

599
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:00,554
Take a mould of our teeth.

600
01:06:00,872 --> 01:06:02,113
You'll see they won't match.

601
01:06:02,313 --> 01:06:03,115
And who did it?

602
01:06:03,315 --> 01:06:06,357
Oh, relax Straniero. This won't be
your first unsolved case, will it?

603
01:06:07,990 --> 01:06:09,177
Hold it!

604
01:06:15,550 --> 01:06:17,050
Oh, come on, Gnaghi...

605
01:06:17,650 --> 01:06:20,750
The world's full of girls like
that, and they've got bodies, too.

606
01:06:23,486 --> 01:06:24,797
By the way,

607
01:06:25,229 --> 01:06:27,706
do you know what my
mother's maiden name was?

608
01:06:29,053 --> 01:06:31,034
You'd never believe it if I told you.

609
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:34,208
She was called Dellamore.

610
01:06:34,450 --> 01:06:36,350
Dellamore.

611
01:06:37,450 --> 01:06:39,362
That means "love"...

612
01:06:40,750 --> 01:06:44,490
You're not the only person in the
world who's lost a lover, Gnaghi.

613
01:06:59,750 --> 01:07:01,032
Get down!

614
01:07:02,050 --> 01:07:03,719
What do you think? Get down from there!

615
01:07:03,919 --> 01:07:05,950
Forget it, engineer!

616
01:07:06,550 --> 01:07:08,106
Go home!

617
01:07:08,306 --> 01:07:09,727
You're supposed to be
setting a good example,

618
01:07:09,927 --> 01:07:12,100
now will you get back to
your coffin immediately!

619
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:14,140
You can't stop me,

620
01:07:14,340 --> 01:07:16,658
you owe your job to me.

621
01:07:16,858 --> 01:07:19,877
- Remember?
- Get down or I'll shoot.

622
01:07:20,118 --> 01:07:21,534
You can't.

623
01:07:21,734 --> 01:07:23,786
I'm the Mayor!

624
01:07:24,150 --> 01:07:25,616
Ex!

625
01:07:42,650 --> 01:07:44,803
- Mr. Dellamorte?
- What?

626
01:07:45,003 --> 01:07:46,850
I'm Civardi, the new Mayor.

627
01:07:47,850 --> 01:07:49,350
Why the barbed wire?

628
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:50,950
Do they climb in at night?

629
01:07:51,250 --> 01:07:53,450
No, they climb out, sometimes.

630
01:07:54,450 --> 01:07:55,950
Would you mind coming down?

631
01:07:56,850 --> 01:07:59,650
You reported an epidemic
which affects the dead.

632
01:08:00,450 --> 01:08:02,350
You claim they come to life

633
01:08:02,550 --> 01:08:04,609
within seven days of burial.

634
01:08:05,004 --> 01:08:09,150
- It says so, right here.
- An M3 report.

635
01:08:09,950 --> 01:08:11,450
- Didn’t you fill it out?
- No.

636
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:14,050
Oh, splendid.

637
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:16,950
So you'll provide us with a denial.

638
01:08:19,329 --> 01:08:21,050
Just sign here.

639
01:08:21,950 --> 01:08:23,550
Franco must have sent it.

640
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:25,350
What a nice thought.

641
01:08:27,150 --> 01:08:28,850
Nothing happened.

642
01:08:29,950 --> 01:08:31,350
Nothing ever happens.

643
01:08:31,550 --> 01:08:34,150
If the press got hold
of something like this,

644
01:08:34,350 --> 01:08:36,850
not only would Buffalora
be a laughing stock,

645
01:08:37,050 --> 01:08:39,350
but you'd lose your job.

646
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:42,450
My personal secretary.

647
01:08:42,550 --> 01:08:44,750
- Mr. Dellamorte.
- A pleasure.

648
01:08:44,950 --> 01:08:46,450
A real pleasure, Mr. Dellamorte.

649
01:08:46,550 --> 01:08:47,750
Thank you.

650
01:08:48,150 --> 01:08:50,450
You and I are going
to get along just fine.

651
01:08:50,950 --> 01:08:51,650
Good-bye.

652
01:09:00,950 --> 01:09:01,850
Your name!

653
01:09:02,450 --> 01:09:04,250
I didn't get your name...

654
01:09:19,250 --> 01:09:21,250
Will I see her again?

655
01:09:32,850 --> 01:09:34,416
Hi!

656
01:09:38,550 --> 01:09:39,950
I'm sorry.

657
01:09:41,350 --> 01:09:43,050
I didn't mean to frighten you, Miss.

658
01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:46,650
I was expecting someone else.

659
01:09:47,450 --> 01:09:50,390
Miss! Miss!

660
01:10:03,650 --> 01:10:05,350
Ever since I got to Buffalora,

661
01:10:05,550 --> 01:10:08,050
strange things have
been happening to me.

662
01:10:08,750 --> 01:10:10,750
It's as if I've been here before.

663
01:10:11,150 --> 01:10:12,750
And that grave...

664
01:10:12,950 --> 01:10:16,664
And you, Mr. Dellamorte, it's as if

665
01:10:16,864 --> 01:10:18,736
I've known you forever.

666
01:10:19,650 --> 01:10:21,950
As if I've loved you forever!

667
01:10:25,550 --> 01:10:26,850
You love me, too?

668
01:10:28,650 --> 01:10:29,550
Why?

669
01:10:29,750 --> 01:10:31,650
Who else is there?

670
01:10:34,950 --> 01:10:36,603
I love you as well.

671
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:38,950
I love you.

672
01:10:44,350 --> 01:10:46,450
I've heard what they
say about you in town.

673
01:10:46,950 --> 01:10:48,650
Is it true that you don't...

674
01:10:48,850 --> 01:10:51,479
I mean, that you can't...

675
01:10:51,679 --> 01:10:53,761
No, you don't wanna
believe town gossip.

676
01:10:53,961 --> 01:10:56,971
Because I can only love an impotent man.

677
01:10:59,435 --> 01:11:01,750
Yeah, it's true. It's true.

678
01:11:01,950 --> 01:11:03,150
I like men...

679
01:11:05,450 --> 01:11:08,450
but their manhood terrifies me.

680
01:11:09,450 --> 01:11:12,250
I can't stand the thought
of them having a...

681
01:11:12,901 --> 01:11:15,650
I mean... you understand?

682
01:11:17,650 --> 01:11:19,450
It's a sort of phobia I have.

683
01:11:20,055 --> 01:11:23,530
I don't have one, I don't
have anything at all.

684
01:11:24,350 --> 01:11:25,350
Will you marry me?

685
01:11:55,650 --> 01:11:57,342
I'm getting married!

686
01:11:57,550 --> 01:11:58,450
Gna!

687
01:11:59,950 --> 01:12:01,323
I'm really getting married!

688
01:12:01,523 --> 01:12:02,868
Don't pretend you
didn't hear everything.

689
01:12:03,068 --> 01:12:04,307
Gna!

690
01:12:04,550 --> 01:12:06,050
Yeah? Why not?

691
01:12:06,250 --> 01:12:07,550
Go ahead, explain...

692
01:12:10,150 --> 01:12:12,050
God gracious...

693
01:12:12,250 --> 01:12:13,250
What are you saying?

694
01:12:13,450 --> 01:12:14,750
You heard me!

695
01:12:15,050 --> 01:12:16,550
My dear boy,

696
01:12:16,850 --> 01:12:20,850
you must be very run down.
I'm going to give you some pills.

697
01:12:22,250 --> 01:12:25,050
Dr Vercesi, I'm serious.

698
01:12:25,950 --> 01:12:28,150
Look, I'm not going to be
intimidated in my own surgery.

699
01:12:28,450 --> 01:12:29,450
That waiting room there

700
01:12:29,650 --> 01:12:32,050
is full of people with good,
honest diseases.

701
01:12:32,250 --> 01:12:33,150
I'll pay you...

702
01:12:35,450 --> 01:12:36,650
Yes I know, but...

703
01:12:38,350 --> 01:12:40,350
How can I? I mean,
everybody knows that...

704
01:12:41,050 --> 01:12:42,250
you haven't got one.

705
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:59,050
I see. You have got one.

706
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:02,850
When would you like me
to relieve you of your...

707
01:13:03,350 --> 01:13:05,249
- ...problem?
- Now.

708
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:28,888
What are you waiting
for? Get on with it!

709
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:42,647
Now what?

710
01:13:49,696 --> 01:13:51,450
I told you I don't want an anaesthetic.

711
01:13:51,650 --> 01:13:52,650
It's not an anaesthetic.

712
01:13:52,850 --> 01:13:54,050
What is it, then?

713
01:13:54,954 --> 01:13:58,337
One shot of this, it'll be
as if you've never had one.

714
01:13:58,750 --> 01:14:00,530
It lasts for over a month.

715
01:14:01,050 --> 01:14:03,650
Look... please don't
make me cut it away.

716
01:14:03,850 --> 01:14:05,939
Today I'm just not up to it.

717
01:14:07,701 --> 01:14:09,413
What are you doing, turning over?

718
01:14:09,613 --> 01:14:11,050
I have to give you
the shot in the front.

719
01:14:11,450 --> 01:14:12,350
Front where?

720
01:14:13,250 --> 01:14:16,650
Hold still, I'll just make a puncture.

721
01:14:43,850 --> 01:14:45,750
That fucking butcher

722
01:14:46,190 --> 01:14:49,016
has given me some kind of infection.

723
01:14:50,350 --> 01:14:51,550
Gnaghi!

724
01:14:52,350 --> 01:14:54,850
I'm hovering between life and death.

725
01:14:55,050 --> 01:14:56,150
Gna!

726
01:14:57,050 --> 01:14:58,440
Yeah, you're right.

727
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:00,650
I suppose I'm used to this condition.

728
01:15:04,150 --> 01:15:07,693
That's her. Don't let her
in. Tell her I'm not here.

729
01:15:07,868 --> 01:15:09,879
I don't want her to see me like this.

730
01:15:17,550 --> 01:15:19,487
- I must see Mr. Dellamorte.
- Gna!

731
01:15:19,687 --> 01:15:23,150
Please, I've got to speak
to him, is he in there?

732
01:15:25,150 --> 01:15:27,384
I'd give my life to be dead.

733
01:15:31,150 --> 01:15:32,561
Gnaghi!

734
01:15:32,750 --> 01:15:34,350
It doesn't hurt anymore.

735
01:15:34,850 --> 01:15:36,450
I think I'm better.

736
01:15:39,650 --> 01:15:40,750
Gna!

737
01:15:41,250 --> 01:15:42,550
When did t happen?

738
01:15:47,950 --> 01:15:49,450
She was our nicest client.

739
01:15:50,150 --> 01:15:52,150
The best always die first.

740
01:15:52,350 --> 01:15:53,350
Gna!

741
01:16:12,350 --> 01:16:15,150
Where have you been?
I thought I'd go mad.

742
01:16:15,550 --> 01:16:17,550
If you only knew what happened to me.

743
01:16:17,750 --> 01:16:19,350
If you only knew what happened to me...

744
01:16:20,550 --> 01:16:22,550
I must talk to you.

745
01:16:25,950 --> 01:16:27,750
We'll always be together.

746
01:16:27,950 --> 01:16:29,750
Yes, my love, yes.

747
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:35,144
I don't know how to say this, but

748
01:16:35,344 --> 01:16:37,788
- the Mayor raped me.
- No!

749
01:16:37,988 --> 01:16:40,750
Wait! I liked it.

750
01:16:40,850 --> 01:16:42,350
Not the violence, no.

751
01:16:42,550 --> 01:16:45,250
But after that, we did it again nicely,

752
01:16:45,450 --> 01:16:48,150
so that I'd forgive him.

753
01:16:48,950 --> 01:16:51,850
It was wonderful, do you understand?

754
01:16:52,150 --> 01:16:56,350
That means I'm cured. I
don't have a phobia anymore.

755
01:16:57,650 --> 01:16:59,650
I can't marry you, now.

756
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:03,850
I'm going to marry him.

757
01:17:04,850 --> 01:17:07,050
That doesn't mean
anything though, I mean,

758
01:17:07,350 --> 01:17:10,550
nothing's changed
between us, I still love you.

759
01:17:11,050 --> 01:17:12,350
You know that.

760
01:17:12,950 --> 01:17:16,950
I just love you in a different
way, but you're important to me.

761
01:17:17,950 --> 01:17:21,450
He knows, I mean, about you and me.

762
01:17:21,950 --> 01:17:23,350
He's a wonderful man,

763
01:17:23,550 --> 01:17:25,450
he said he's happy we can be friends.

764
01:17:25,550 --> 01:17:27,550
We can still see each other.

765
01:17:27,950 --> 01:17:29,650
Nothing's changed.

766
01:17:30,350 --> 01:17:32,550
Everything's just as it was.

767
01:17:34,850 --> 01:17:36,050
Everything.

768
01:17:54,850 --> 01:17:58,350
You look for Death in the clear night,

769
01:17:59,450 --> 01:18:01,750
you tell her you still love her,

770
01:18:02,650 --> 01:18:04,750
that you are her slave,

771
01:18:05,650 --> 01:18:07,650
that she's still your queen.

772
01:18:07,950 --> 01:18:09,850
Death, Death,

773
01:18:10,950 --> 01:18:12,850
Death, the whore.

774
01:18:24,750 --> 01:18:26,850
No, I'd only do it for the fear

775
01:18:27,750 --> 01:18:29,843
and I'd come back

776
01:18:30,050 --> 01:18:32,850
just to experience the same fear again.

777
01:18:33,850 --> 01:18:35,350
To be afraid,

778
01:18:36,150 --> 01:18:38,550
always to be afraid.

779
01:18:46,350 --> 01:18:47,350
Hi!

780
01:18:48,650 --> 01:18:52,050
Is that white VW outside yours?

781
01:18:54,850 --> 01:18:56,350
We're on foot.

782
01:18:56,850 --> 01:18:58,850
Could you give us a lift?

783
01:18:59,550 --> 01:19:00,750
It's not very far.

784
01:19:02,450 --> 01:19:04,050
Go on!

785
01:19:05,850 --> 01:19:06,950
I'm Magda.

786
01:19:09,250 --> 01:19:11,750
And this is Laura.

787
01:19:19,050 --> 01:19:20,520
How far is it?

788
01:19:26,550 --> 01:19:29,050
This is where we live,
with another girlfriend.

789
01:19:37,450 --> 01:19:39,977
Do you want to come up for a drink?

790
01:19:40,850 --> 01:19:44,213
Come on, you're not afraid
of two college girls, are you?

791
01:19:48,050 --> 01:19:52,060
Make a wish. I grant wishes.

792
01:19:54,050 --> 01:19:56,050
I want you to fall in love with me.

793
01:20:01,850 --> 01:20:04,050
But I'm already in love with you.

794
01:20:04,550 --> 01:20:06,350
Haven't you noticed?

795
01:20:12,550 --> 01:20:14,550
It's cold in here.

796
01:20:17,650 --> 01:20:20,150
If you'd like to wash,
there's a sink there.

797
01:20:35,850 --> 01:20:38,236
I didn't mean your face, silly!

798
01:20:39,150 --> 01:20:41,525
I don't know whether I can do it.

799
01:20:41,750 --> 01:20:43,650
I've been taking some medication...

800
01:20:55,050 --> 01:20:57,550
I don't think your
medication is working!

801
01:21:12,450 --> 01:21:13,850
Do you love me?

802
01:21:16,050 --> 01:21:17,250
Yes,

803
01:21:17,650 --> 01:21:19,550
if you stay all night.

804
01:21:21,250 --> 01:21:23,150
All my life, too.

805
01:21:28,450 --> 01:21:31,550
- Come on!
- Let's rest a bit.

806
01:21:31,650 --> 01:21:33,250
- Why?
- You've come three times already.

807
01:21:33,550 --> 01:21:35,850
Twice. The third one was faked.

808
01:21:44,650 --> 01:21:46,650
She's sleeping, she's
been studying all day.

809
01:21:46,950 --> 01:21:48,950
she's got an exam tomorrow morning.

810
01:21:49,250 --> 01:21:52,150
I just wanted to get some wine.

811
01:21:52,350 --> 01:21:53,650
Sit down.

812
01:21:54,050 --> 01:21:55,550
I'll get you some.

813
01:22:11,350 --> 01:22:14,450
Did Laura tell you you can pay me?

814
01:22:15,050 --> 01:22:15,750
Pay you?

815
01:22:15,850 --> 01:22:17,950
School’s expensive, my friend.

816
01:22:19,650 --> 01:22:20,550
I have to pay you?

817
01:22:21,250 --> 01:22:22,650
We don't have a scholarship, you know.

818
01:22:24,450 --> 01:22:26,850
Besides, it's only 100,000 lira.

819
01:22:28,950 --> 01:22:30,650
She told me she loved me...

820
01:22:31,950 --> 01:22:33,850
That's 150,000.

821
01:22:34,550 --> 01:22:36,050
She wants me to stay the night.

822
01:22:36,650 --> 01:22:38,450
200,000.

823
01:22:39,050 --> 01:22:40,350
Is a cheque all right?

824
01:22:40,650 --> 01:22:42,450
It's money, isn't it?

825
01:22:44,050 --> 01:22:45,750
Hurry, darling.

826
01:22:45,950 --> 01:22:47,950
I'm cold.

827
01:22:48,350 --> 01:22:50,250
Come and warm me up.

828
01:22:52,350 --> 01:22:54,850
I need your warmth.

829
01:22:55,950 --> 01:22:57,850
Warm me up.

830
01:22:58,650 --> 01:23:00,150
Coming, love.

831
01:23:04,850 --> 01:23:06,350
Now you'll be warm forever.

832
01:23:33,750 --> 01:23:35,850
This time I'm really through with love.

833
01:23:57,250 --> 01:24:00,250
I bet you'd like to know where I was
between 1 and 3 last night, wouldn't you?

834
01:24:00,350 --> 01:24:01,850
I know, I know.

835
01:24:02,150 --> 01:24:04,250
Here we are. Have no fear,

836
01:24:04,350 --> 01:24:05,850
I won't tell anybody about this cheque,

837
01:24:06,050 --> 01:24:07,750
this is the reason I came here.

838
01:24:08,050 --> 01:24:10,250
We're both worldly men, aren't we?

839
01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:14,121
- But this could be proof against...
- Proof against whom?

840
01:24:14,321 --> 01:24:16,174
We've already arrested
the guilty party.

841
01:24:16,374 --> 01:24:18,022
After setting fire to the apartment,

842
01:24:18,222 --> 01:24:20,011
he went home, killed
his wife and daughter,

843
01:24:20,211 --> 01:24:24,509
then turned himself in. He's at
the hospital, the psychiatric ward.

844
01:24:26,250 --> 01:24:28,750
Somebody's stolen my crimes!

845
01:24:40,150 --> 01:24:41,150
Sir?

846
01:24:42,050 --> 01:24:44,193
Excuse me, this section
is closed to the public.

847
01:24:44,393 --> 01:24:45,516
I've come to see the killer.

848
01:24:45,716 --> 01:24:47,950
But you can't go in
there. He's in a coma.

849
01:24:48,350 --> 01:24:50,071
He drank a whole bottle of iodine.

850
01:24:50,271 --> 01:24:52,131
I have to take his measurements.

851
01:24:54,650 --> 01:24:56,180
Franco!

852
01:25:00,887 --> 01:25:04,079
You looked a lot better the last
time we talked on the phone.

853
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:30,850
Thief!

854
01:25:32,850 --> 01:25:34,450
You're a thief...

855
01:25:35,850 --> 01:25:39,593
You may have killed your wife and
daughter, OK, I'll give you that,

856
01:25:39,793 --> 01:25:41,750
but it was me who knocked
off the three girls.

857
01:25:41,850 --> 01:25:44,250
What are you doing stealing my murders?

858
01:25:44,450 --> 01:25:46,550
What kind of fucking
friend do you think you are?

859
01:25:47,850 --> 01:25:50,062
Especially as you thought
you were doing me a favour.

860
01:25:50,262 --> 01:25:51,911
Put that out immediately!

861
01:25:52,111 --> 01:25:53,150
- Smoking is not allowed in here!
- Shut up!

862
01:25:58,350 --> 01:26:00,670
He's in a coma. He doesn't even notice.

863
01:26:00,870 --> 01:26:02,355
Shit.

864
01:26:03,350 --> 01:26:04,792
What'd you say?

865
01:26:13,150 --> 01:26:15,706
Everything's shit.

866
01:26:15,850 --> 01:26:18,865
The only thing that's not shitty...

867
01:26:19,950 --> 01:26:21,705
is sleep.

868
01:26:21,905 --> 01:26:23,150
What are you doing on the floor, sister?

869
01:26:23,350 --> 01:26:24,350
She's praying.

870
01:26:24,750 --> 01:26:26,250
Friend of yours?

871
01:26:26,550 --> 01:26:29,950
Look, he hasn't got any relatives
and the coma he's in is irreversible.

872
01:26:30,150 --> 01:26:31,278
Give me a signature

873
01:26:31,578 --> 01:26:34,034
- and I'll pull the plug now.
- Fuck off!

874
01:26:48,850 --> 01:26:51,540
Here we go. Put it back in there.

875
01:26:52,547 --> 01:26:54,350
I won't let you die

876
01:26:54,950 --> 01:26:57,050
until you give me an explanation.

877
01:26:58,050 --> 01:26:59,850
Why did you steal my murders?

878
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:05,620
Don't you think anything
I do counts? Huh?

879
01:27:05,850 --> 01:27:07,250
Oh, my God! What happened?

880
01:27:07,650 --> 01:27:10,904
They killed each other. It
was a settling of scores.

881
01:27:11,850 --> 01:27:13,149
Don't you believe me?

882
01:27:13,349 --> 01:27:14,595
- No!
- Tough.

883
01:27:19,950 --> 01:27:21,491
So bad...

884
01:27:25,650 --> 01:27:27,044
So,

885
01:27:27,442 --> 01:27:30,436
is that all you have any need
to say to your only friend?

886
01:27:34,650 --> 01:27:36,286
Who are you?

887
01:27:36,650 --> 01:27:38,582
I don't know you.

888
01:27:38,783 --> 01:27:40,942
I don't know who you are.

889
01:27:41,250 --> 01:27:42,505
Go away.

890
01:27:43,850 --> 01:27:46,127
Go away!

891
01:28:01,450 --> 01:28:02,450
Dellamorte, wait.

892
01:28:03,050 --> 01:28:05,897
For God's sake, wait! There's
another maniac on the loose.

893
01:28:06,097 --> 01:28:07,866
He's on the 4th floor killing people.

894
01:28:08,066 --> 01:28:10,626
He already shot three.
You got a gun!

895
01:28:11,008 --> 01:28:12,836
That's good. Now you can defend yourself.

896
01:28:13,036 --> 01:28:15,991
Hey, take my advice and get
the hell out of here quick!

897
01:28:18,050 --> 01:28:19,350
Straniero!

898
01:28:19,650 --> 01:28:20,950
It was me!

899
01:29:12,850 --> 01:29:14,350
You and I are both the same.

900
01:29:16,650 --> 01:29:18,850
We kill out of indifference,

901
01:29:19,950 --> 01:29:21,827
out of love sometimes,

902
01:29:25,150 --> 01:29:27,050
but never out of hate.

903
01:29:33,050 --> 01:29:35,450
Now I don't know who's dead or alive.

904
01:29:36,850 --> 01:29:38,050
I'm sick of killing.

905
01:29:41,050 --> 01:29:43,850
So I'm leaving the game, brother.

906
01:29:45,350 --> 01:29:48,050
Dellamorte Dellamore

907
01:29:48,350 --> 01:29:50,467
bids you farewell

908
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:53,071
and is on his way.

909
01:29:53,650 --> 01:29:55,295
Where to?

910
01:30:00,150 --> 01:30:02,308
Better get out of here.

911
01:30:02,678 --> 01:30:04,918
Even the statue's talking.

912
01:30:06,850 --> 01:30:09,101
Where do you think you're going?

913
01:30:09,301 --> 01:30:11,756
if you haven't yet
understood the difference

914
01:30:11,956 --> 01:30:14,454
between life and me.

915
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:29,458
Gnaghi, you're not bringing that!

916
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:36,852
That coffin is not coming with us!

917
01:31:11,899 --> 01:31:14,300
Yeah, I missed that one. Don't
worry, I'll get the next one.

918
01:31:14,770 --> 01:31:17,898
Oh calm down. I know
every bump on this road.

919
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:21,675
There's one!

920
01:31:25,100 --> 01:31:26,300
Look!

921
01:31:28,700 --> 01:31:30,878
I'd never been this far.

922
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:34,641
We made it, Gnaghi!

923
01:31:39,100 --> 01:31:41,193
Who could have imagined this?

924
01:31:41,394 --> 01:31:44,021
Wider than all the streets
of Buffalora put together.

925
01:31:44,700 --> 01:31:47,707
- It never seems to end!
- Gna!

926
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:51,113
Hang on, Gnaghi.

927
01:31:51,900 --> 01:31:54,200
Past this tunnel is
the rest of the world.

928
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:06,000
What do you think the rest of
the world looks like, Gnaghi?

929
01:32:06,900 --> 01:32:08,300
Can you imagine it?

930
01:32:13,300 --> 01:32:16,300
You're right. It's beyond imagination.

931
01:33:07,300 --> 01:33:09,000
I should have known it.

932
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:13,700
The rest of the world doesn't exist.

933
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:25,700
Gnaghi!

934
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:29,316
Gnaghi, you weren't
hit that hard. Come on.

935
01:33:29,609 --> 01:33:31,568
Come on, I'll take you
to the car. Come on,

936
01:33:31,647 --> 01:33:33,138
Come on! Why are you going on
like this? You've just got cut.

937
01:33:33,338 --> 01:33:35,316
Come on man, get up,
I'll take you to the car!

938
01:33:35,516 --> 01:33:37,558
Come on! Come on, get up!

939
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:40,276
What? What?

940
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:41,600
Gnaghi!

941
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,000
Gnaghi!

942
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:51,174
Don't leave me alone
now. Gnaghi! Gnaghi!

943
01:33:54,200 --> 01:33:55,934
Oh God!

944
01:33:56,500 --> 01:33:57,300
Death,

945
01:33:57,700 --> 01:34:00,600
death, death comes sweeping down,

946
01:34:01,300 --> 01:34:03,900
filthy death the leering clown,

947
01:34:04,100 --> 01:34:06,744
death on wings, death by surprise,

948
01:34:06,944 --> 01:34:09,279
veiling evil from worldly eyes,

949
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:10,900
death that's born

950
01:34:11,100 --> 01:34:13,400
as life succumbs, while death and love

951
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:15,800
two kindred drums, beat the time

952
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,600
till Judgement Day,

953
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:18,800
an actor

954
01:34:18,900 --> 01:34:20,100
in a Passion Play,

955
01:34:20,300 --> 01:34:22,000
without beginning, without end,

956
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:24,393
evermore.

957
01:34:24,593 --> 01:34:26,001
Amen.

958
01:34:50,300 --> 01:34:52,800
You're my best friend.

959
01:34:55,670 --> 01:34:58,172
I didn't even realise it.

960
01:35:46,799 --> 01:35:48,398
Could you take me home?

961
01:35:48,664 --> 01:35:50,066
Please.

962
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,300
Gna.

963
01:35:56,655 --> 01:35:56,655
