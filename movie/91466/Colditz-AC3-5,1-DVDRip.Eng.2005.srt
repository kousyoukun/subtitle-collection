1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,683
London 1939

2
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:12,692
You saw that? He could not play it.

3
00:00:14,694 --> 00:00:17,697
It has nearly nine years. But may not move their feet so il.

4
00:00:18,698 --> 00:00:20,700
You are a boy. I am an officer and a gentleman.

5
00:00:22,702 --> 00:00:23,703
Well, certainly you're an officer.

6
00:00:27,665 --> 00:00:29,667
Come back.

7
00:00:37,675 --> 00:00:39,677
You are worried?

8
00:00:39,678 --> 00:00:41,679
Of course not.

9
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,681
You'll come back.

10
00:00:48,686 --> 00:00:50,688
These last three weeks have been the best week of my life.

11
00:00:51,689 --> 00:00:54,692
I met you and ... I love you.

12
00:01:16,693 --> 00:01:18,693
What is it? Nothing.

13
00:01:20,694 --> 00:01:22,694
What were you saying? Jack?

14
00:01:24,695 --> 00:01:26,695
It can wait. Jack!

15
00:02:01,696 --> 00:02:03,696
Germany four months later. Camp soldiers Biberach.

16
00:02:38,697 --> 00:02:40,697
He is free.

17
00:02:42,698 --> 00:02:44,698
Let's go.

18
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:49,699
Du-te.

19
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,700
Fuck.

20
00:03:27,701 --> 00:03:29,701
Come on, faster!

21
00:03:34,702 --> 00:03:36,702
Where? Well you're an officer.

22
00:03:36,703 --> 00:03:39,703
... South or West.

23
00:03:39,704 --> 00:03:41,704
Calm down hell once and let go.

24
00:03:45,705 --> 00:03:47,705
McGrade, where are you going?

25
00:03:49,706 --> 00:03:51,706
Collins! Oh God! Collins!

26
00:03:51,707 --> 00:03:52,707
Jack! Jack's dead! Let's go!

27
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,708
They caught.

28
00:04:39,709 --> 00:04:41,709
McGrade?

29
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,710
What to do now?

30
00:04:49,711 --> 00:04:51,711
The border is about 80 kilometers away.

31
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,712
That's south.

32
00:05:01,713 --> 00:05:03,713
You're right, Jack. Jack!

33
00:05:07,714 --> 00:05:09,714
You have to wash.

34
00:06:20,715 --> 00:06:22,715
Here.

35
00:06:36,716 --> 00:06:38,716
How fast can you Jack.

36
00:06:52,717 --> 00:06:54,717
McGrade ends.

37
00:06:56,718 --> 00:06:58,718
We were supposed to meet somewhere.

38
00:07:04,719 --> 00:07:06,719
That Dilinjon. You walk in a circle.

39
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,720
Let's go.

40
00:07:19,721 --> 00:07:21,721
Stay where you are.

41
00:07:26,722 --> 00:07:28,722
Good boy.

42
00:07:31,723 --> 00:07:33,723
Sit down.

43
00:07:36,724 --> 00:07:38,724
Bravo.

44
00:08:04,725 --> 00:08:06,725
Do you like dogs?

45
00:08:07,726 --> 00:08:09,726
I grew up with them.

46
00:08:11,727 --> 00:08:13,727
I thought so.

47
00:08:17,728 --> 00:08:19,728
Dogs are better than people sometimes.

48
00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:28,729
Dogs not disappoint you.

49
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:30,730
Total submission. Like the army.

50
00:08:35,731 --> 00:08:37,731
Let's go. We should wait until it gets dark.

51
00:08:37,732 --> 00:08:39,732
I said move, corporal.

52
00:09:04,733 --> 00:09:06,733
Good. There are three hours until dark.

53
00:09:10,734 --> 00:09:13,734
If we take the time that has passed and our speed may not be quite as much to the border.

54
00:09:16,735 --> 00:09:18,735
You have no idea what you're talking. Shut McGrade.Esti lucky you're here.

55
00:09:26,736 --> 00:09:28,736
We are all lucky that we are here.

56
00:09:33,737 --> 00:09:35,737
I was thinking about Coliins.

57
00:09:35,738 --> 00:09:37,738
You have to forget what happened. Yes it is, old man.

58
00:09:40,739 --> 00:09:43,739
And everything whereon they could do. And then in an instant everything is lost.

59
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,740
Who is she?

60
00:09:56,741 --> 00:09:58,741
Lizy Carter.

61
00:10:02,742 --> 00:10:05,742
Not even a dog. Neither departe.Frumoasa.

62
00:10:13,743 --> 00:10:15,743
It's the only reason to go back. Even if only for one night.

63
00:10:20,744 --> 00:10:23,744
The only thing I would have to do was to ask the Lizy Carter marriage.

64
00:10:35,745 --> 00:10:38,745
Want to know why I joined the army? To fight the Germans like us.

65
00:10:40,746 --> 00:10:44,746
Do not go to jail. See Captain, I was not hurt nor bottom of your army.

66
00:10:45,747 --> 00:10:47,747
Some older children who play the soldiers.

67
00:10:59,748 --> 00:11:01,748
He wants his face, I just want to live.

68
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:07,749
God no one wants to go back and fight.

69
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,750
That's Switzerland, damn either.

70
00:12:09,751 --> 00:12:11,751
It's a border area. Check the entire lumea.Trebuie to see how to get around.

71
00:12:16,752 --> 00:12:18,752
Let's go.

72
00:12:41,753 --> 00:12:43,753
Whatever happens, do not run away.

73
00:13:01,754 --> 00:13:03,754
Guards.

74
00:13:15,755 --> 00:13:17,755
What's the plan, sir?

75
00:13:24,756 --> 00:13:26,756
We can go there.

76
00:13:27,757 --> 00:13:29,757
One by one.

77
00:14:57,758 --> 00:14:59,758
Go te.O them distracting. They will shoot.

78
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:07,759
Just do one thing for me. Find it on Lizy Carter.

79
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,760
Hello gentlemen. Welcome to Castle Ofleckosicolditz.

80
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:33,761
My name is Fritz Werner and I'm chief officer in charge of security.

81
00:17:35,762 --> 00:17:37,762
This castle will be your home throughout the war.

82
00:17:40,763 --> 00:17:42,763
He was elected voi.Pentru especially for people like you.

83
00:17:49,764 --> 00:17:51,764
Surely you try to escape in the future, but you can not be sure of that.

84
00:17:51,765 --> 00:17:53,765
If you try you will be shot.

85
00:17:57,766 --> 00:17:59,766
Eventually you give up. The sooner the better

86
00:18:02,767 --> 00:18:04,767
Do you have any questions.

87
00:18:04,768 --> 00:18:06,768
When I get back to England to send a picture of Buckingham Palace and Piazza Truham?

88
00:18:42,769 --> 00:18:44,769
You're very kind, thank you.

89
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:52,770
Welcome, guys.

90
00:18:55,771 --> 00:18:57,771
Not esteemed, is Canadian. Benning my name.

91
00:18:57,772 --> 00:18:58,772
Willis. Jethrow.

92
00:19:10,773 --> 00:19:12,773
Welcome. Thank you.

93
00:19:20,774 --> 00:19:22,774
Beam. Switzerland.

94
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:26,775
Gentlemen, allow me to introduce our first successful escape of the war.

95
00:19:29,776 --> 00:19:31,776
Corporal Nicholas McGrade.

96
00:19:57,777 --> 00:19:59,777
So tomorrow we should think you take here.

97
00:20:06,778 --> 00:20:08,778
I'm not going anywhere. I did datoria.Eu I'm happy here.

98
00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:13,779
I'm afraid that's not possible. Why?

99
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,780
You can not stay here is a neutral country and you're a British soldier.

100
00:20:21,781 --> 00:20:23,781
If Speaking of business, the military owes me six months' pay.

101
00:20:29,782 --> 00:20:31,782
Very good.

102
00:20:40,783 --> 00:20:44,783
Each station at a distance of 40 km is equipped with well-armed guards day and night

103
00:20:45,784 --> 00:20:47,784
and to the border of a neutral country are 600 km.

104
00:20:49,785 --> 00:20:51,785
Since you are here? Several saptamani.Bret is longer, about a month.

105
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:58,886
Where are you from? Bevorack, you? Brandenburg. I escaped with another pilot, I tecut through the gate.

106
00:21:01,887 --> 00:21:05,887
About 20 km from the border I came across some Germans who apparently never heard of the Geneva Convention.

107
00:21:07,887 --> 00:21:10,887
My friend was killed on the spot, I survived.

108
00:21:12,888 --> 00:21:15,888
It's not as bad as it looks. The bullet passed and I did not hit any major organ.

109
00:21:24,889 --> 00:21:26,889
Receive e happen, bulldog-ul.

110
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:37,890
Tomorrow morning we will try to get out of here. So I want!

111
00:22:18,891 --> 00:22:20,891
Hi.

112
00:22:21,892 --> 00:22:24,892
Hello. Can I get something to drink.

113
00:22:27,893 --> 00:22:29,893
No, thanks. Why not?

114
00:22:31,894 --> 00:22:33,894
I meet a friend.

115
00:22:44,892 --> 00:22:46,892
Nicholas McGrade.

116
00:22:49,893 --> 00:22:51,893
Come on do not be scared I will not bite you.

117
00:22:57,894 --> 00:22:59,894
Valeri. I am pleased.

118
00:23:01,895 --> 00:23:03,895
You must not be shy Valeri. What are you drinking?

119
00:23:10,895 --> 00:23:17,895
Sorry I did not quite understand. I said can not you understand that the lady does not want to have anything to do with a drunk like you.

120
00:23:23,896 --> 00:23:25,896
May be! As they see it, a Swiss who wants to fight.

121
00:23:27,897 --> 00:23:31,897
I think the dream, the Swiss do not fight. Just sit and rub mint.

122
00:23:41,898 --> 00:23:43,898
Surprise surprise.

123
00:24:29,899 --> 00:24:32,899
Multumesc.Perfect.Poftim here.

124
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,900
How are you old? You've had bad luck.

125
00:24:58,901 --> 00:25:02,901
Are you okay? I got some bad news.

126
00:25:02,902 --> 00:25:07,902
It seems like that that I've beaten bar is the son of a local judge. So would not let you get away that easy.

127
00:25:11,903 --> 00:25:14,903
Oh, Lord, do not you do something? Well we'll hand you over to us but

128
00:25:14,904 --> 00:25:19,904
British government will give you the punishment you deserve and your file think il give you at least 10 years.

129
00:25:26,905 --> 00:25:28,905
Do not despair, there are always ways to get out of these situations.

130
00:25:31,906 --> 00:25:33,906
I do not believe you you did not realize one thing.

131
00:25:35,907 --> 00:25:38,907
I think you're cut out for it. You have a tendency to crime.

132
00:25:47,908 --> 00:25:52,908
When you arrive in London you will be contacted by Lt.Col.Fordoms a very nice bath.

133
00:25:53,909 --> 00:25:55,909
I'll tell him what's up.

134
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:03,910
You planned all this.

135
00:26:04,911 --> 00:26:06,911
Be happy, go home.

136
00:26:34,912 --> 00:26:37,912
Dear Lizy, I write in the other camp now.

137
00:26:39,913 --> 00:26:42,913
I gave the last just to get here.

138
00:26:43,914 --> 00:26:45,914
It's not that bad.

139
00:26:48,915 --> 00:26:50,915
The food is not even sides, so we can handle.

140
00:26:55,916 --> 00:26:58,916
Others here are doing pretty good and we keep each other company.

141
00:27:00,917 --> 00:27:04,917
This place is an ancient castle that looks like Dracula.

142
00:27:09,918 --> 00:27:13,918
How are you? We do not receive news here than the Germans who tell us that London was bombed by Lutwafer.

143
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:19,919
Hope you're well.

144
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,920
Sorry I'm not very good at writing thing.

145
00:27:28,921 --> 00:27:31,921
There are so many things I want to tell you that you had to have told them.

146
00:27:36,922 --> 00:27:39,922
All I know is that I really miss you.

147
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:37,923
Coloum reporter? In front and to the left.

148
00:28:53,924 --> 00:28:55,924
Corporal McGrade? Da.Pe here please.

149
00:29:04,925 --> 00:29:06,925
I need special parts, not nonsense.

150
00:29:08,926 --> 00:29:10,926
Components man! And biscuits where crackers.

151
00:29:12,927 --> 00:29:15,927
Corporal McGrade, sir. Ah yes, McGrade well excellent.

152
00:29:17,928 --> 00:29:20,928
Thanks Mary. Welcome to MI9 and congratulations.

153
00:29:21,929 --> 00:29:24,929
The first who managed to escape from war, counting what's best for us Bunny.

154
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:28,930
Did they tell us? Who tell asshole? You were supposed to be top secret.

155
00:29:32,931 --> 00:29:37,931
That is ML9, a division of the Secret Service and I ganditca want to know who McGrade if you still work together.

156
00:29:42,932 --> 00:29:44,932
Wrong ... and do not forget those components.

157
00:29:46,933 --> 00:29:48,933
Um unique man. Where were we?

158
00:29:49,934 --> 00:29:53,934
Ah yes, we are here to help people like tine.Oameni who escaped from POW camps.

159
00:29:58,935 --> 00:30:00,935
Moral.Te is very good for you in the socket. Good. How was it?

160
00:30:01,936 --> 00:30:03,936
Slow.

161
00:30:04,937 --> 00:30:06,937
But that house in Marseille?

162
00:30:08,938 --> 00:30:12,938
That where I stayed for a week without food and acolo.Pai crowded you could not go up in a plane and send you to hell.

163
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,940
Unfortunately where I was bine.Din McGrade still is war and you have to do and aprt of it, we understand?

164
00:30:22,941 --> 00:30:25,941
Are you clear it, Corporal McGrade? Da.Da and what else?

165
00:30:30,942 --> 00:30:32,942
Yes, sir.

166
00:30:33,943 --> 00:30:37,943
Bravo! E, and one more thing. From now on you'll be lieutenant McGrade.

167
00:30:38,944 --> 00:30:42,944
I think after the first part of the war deserve a promotion.

168
00:30:49,945 --> 00:30:52,945
Your office is right here next workshop Mr. Warren.

169
00:30:56,946 --> 00:30:58,946
I would be preferred over the top.

170
00:30:59,947 --> 00:31:01,947
Do you need anything else? No, thanks.

171
00:31:04,948 --> 00:31:07,948
Do you have a place to stay? No, I know nimeni.Asta is the first time I come here.

172
00:31:10,949 --> 00:31:12,949
I will prepare a room. You must take your uniform.

173
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:21,950
Good. I'll leave you to accustom. In fact, it is someone they know.

174
00:31:23,951 --> 00:31:25,951
O Lizy Carter.

175
00:31:29,952 --> 00:31:32,952
I promised a friend that I seek. I'll see what I can do.

176
00:31:35,953 --> 00:31:37,953
Thank you. You're welcome, Lieutenant.

177
00:32:09,954 --> 00:32:12,954
Excuse me sir. Leave me alone.

178
00:32:14,955 --> 00:32:16,955
Lieutenant McGrade are head ... I mean sir.

179
00:32:27,956 --> 00:32:29,956
What the hell are you doing? Fell. Of course it fell. This is and should be.

180
00:32:35,957 --> 00:32:37,957
Both are separate. Beautiful shoe boots becomes.

181
00:32:41,958 --> 00:32:43,958
What do you want? I'm busy.

182
00:32:45,959 --> 00:32:47,959
Jesus, what's that smell?

183
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,960
It's natural gelatin. You can write to her on almost anything.

184
00:32:56,961 --> 00:32:59,961
Silk, folds, it is easy to hide. God, you're worse than I thought.

185
00:33:05,962 --> 00:33:08,962
We could use it. I was also a POW.

186
00:33:15,963 --> 00:33:18,963
Yes I know. Why do you think they are so reasonable?

187
00:33:21,964 --> 00:33:23,964
Want to see my compasses? Sure.

188
00:33:30,965 --> 00:33:32,965
This?

189
00:33:33,966 --> 00:33:36,966
It is a channel. Yes I know.

190
00:33:40,967 --> 00:33:44,067
And there's latrine. Come! January Meet Jack Jack he is in January.

191
00:33:46,068 --> 00:33:49,068
January is an engineer and believe that we can escape through the channel.

192
00:33:54,069 --> 00:33:57,069
Let's take a look.

193
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:04,070
Can you see anything. Oh yes.

194
00:34:06,071 --> 00:34:08,071
One more thing. Come.

195
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:13,072
After about 50 meters channel that is connected to the main drainage holes.

196
00:34:15,073 --> 00:34:17,073
If we assume that we take on where you get to latrines and get there.

197
00:34:20,074 --> 00:34:22,074
And where we go?

198
00:34:24,075 --> 00:34:26,075
Unfortunately this is the only outlet that we can see.

199
00:34:29,076 --> 00:34:33,076
The problem is that it is guarded 24 hours a day. You can not leave without you shoot or give way to alarm first.

200
00:34:36,077 --> 00:34:38,077
It is just an option. What is it? Do something with the guard.

201
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,078
What? ll buy. Well, can we buy them?

202
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:49,079
There are three guards in rotation between Ala 24 hours.

203
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,080
The first two are motionless, but the third guard, Meisner, is a little weak.

204
00:34:58,081 --> 00:35:02,081
I have a feeling about him. He's not a puppy too happy and I think he is the man you are looking for.

205
00:35:19,082 --> 00:35:21,082
Want to play? I think you like to play.

206
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:28,083
I think you lost your wedding ring. I think your wife is very angry with you.

207
00:35:31,084 --> 00:35:33,084
Less'll lose your ears. I'll you a bite, right?

208
00:35:42,085 --> 00:35:44,085
What you need to get another ring?

209
00:35:57,086 --> 00:35:59,086
Leaves. Go!

210
00:37:04,087 --> 00:37:06,087
Keep the change, old man!

211
00:37:34,088 --> 00:37:36,088
How did it go?

212
00:37:36,089 --> 00:37:38,089
Damn! It's done.

213
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:44,090
You're a wonderful human being! That's how it is.

214
00:37:48,091 --> 00:37:50,091
Are you ready? Come on.

215
00:38:02,092 --> 00:38:04,092
You sure do not want to join us? Inside there got to be kidding.

216
00:38:21,092 --> 00:38:23,092
Oh gosh!

217
00:38:28,093 --> 00:38:30,093
Haide Jack!

218
00:39:21,094 --> 00:39:23,094
Acolo.Acolo's section on prisoners. We have to take the left.

219
00:39:36,095 --> 00:39:38,095
What is Willis?

220
00:39:39,096 --> 00:39:41,096
Beware this thread.

221
00:40:06,097 --> 00:40:08,097
Willis!

222
00:40:11,098 --> 00:40:13,098
Willis, if we here we'll go to hell.

223
00:40:27,099 --> 00:40:29,099
Oh, God, what ugly stinks!

224
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:39,100
Willis!

225
00:40:39,101 --> 00:40:40,101
Willis can not see any way out.

226
00:40:54,102 --> 00:40:56,102
Willis look!

227
00:41:47,103 --> 00:41:49,103
Look up here.

228
00:41:53,104 --> 00:41:55,104
We get out here.

229
00:41:56,205 --> 00:41:58,205
Are you sure? Yes.

230
00:42:01,206 --> 00:42:03,206
Let then skinny, you push!

231
00:42:58,207 --> 00:43:00,207
Stop! Move away from the door! Hands up!

232
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:07,208
Well gentlemen.

233
00:43:11,209 --> 00:43:13,209
You tried to escape.

234
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:24,210
Let us look better.

235
00:43:25,211 --> 00:43:27,211
Return!

236
00:43:32,212 --> 00:43:34,212
Return! Come on. What are you doing?

237
00:43:40,213 --> 00:43:42,213
Oh no, God!

238
00:43:44,214 --> 00:43:46,214
Do not do this, please!

239
00:43:51,215 --> 00:43:53,215
Fire!

240
00:44:05,216 --> 00:44:07,216
Next time will not joking.

241
00:44:33,217 --> 00:44:35,217
Lieutenant McGrade girlfriend that he wanted to look for.

242
00:44:38,218 --> 00:44:40,218
They were hit pretty bad last night. Yes it is.

243
00:45:23,219 --> 00:45:25,219
Sleep, slept only.

244
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:40,220
Oh God help me.

245
00:46:11,221 --> 00:46:14,221
Excuse me. Lieutenant sorry but we have to wait your turn.

246
00:46:15,222 --> 00:46:17,222
If your house has been hit must wait about noon equipment.

247
00:46:19,223 --> 00:46:22,223
If you talk to Mrs. missing persons there. You Lizy Carter?

248
00:46:23,224 --> 00:46:25,224
Da, de ce?

249
00:46:26,225 --> 00:46:29,225
I do not think it's time nor place but I have some information about Jack Rawles.

250
00:46:38,326 --> 00:46:40,326
Jack? Around here.

251
00:46:44,227 --> 00:46:46,227
Thank God.

252
00:46:47,228 --> 00:46:49,228
The last letter that I have of him is of two months ago. I started to think ...

253
00:46:50,229 --> 00:46:54,229
No, it's all right. He has a sprained ankle and a bump soundly, but besides this has nothing.

254
00:46:57,230 --> 00:46:59,230
Sorry but how did you two meet? I escaped together.

255
00:47:02,231 --> 00:47:06,231
He hit his ankle and caught the Germans. I escaped, I'm sorry.

256
00:47:09,232 --> 00:47:12,232
You know where he is now? No, all I tried to find out when I returned.

257
00:47:15,233 --> 00:47:18,233
I was assigned to a special unit that helps soldiers POW.

258
00:47:20,234 --> 00:47:22,234
If you hear anything let me know.

259
00:47:29,235 --> 00:47:32,235
I hate this. I really do not like.

260
00:47:35,236 --> 00:47:39,236
Know.

261
00:47:41,237 --> 00:47:44,237
But if it's any consolation, I think you do a great job.

262
00:47:45,238 --> 00:47:48,238
Thank you, Lieutenant ... McGrade Nick McGrade.

263
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:52,239
I have to go. Of course.

264
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:58,240
How did you know what I look like? Jack makes us admire your picture all the time.

265
00:48:09,241 --> 00:48:12,241
Jack asked me to find you. Lizy's war if you have not noticed.

266
00:48:15,242 --> 00:48:18,242
I'm coming, I'm sorry but I have to go ...

267
00:48:19,243 --> 00:48:22,243
Where can I find you if I find out something new? Here, we work impreuna.Mi was nice to meet you.

268
00:48:23,244 --> 00:48:26,244
Thank you bothered. There was no trouble.

269
00:48:52,245 --> 00:48:55,245
Bravo guys, bravo!

270
00:48:56,246 --> 00:48:58,246
Calm down!

271
00:48:59,247 --> 00:49:01,247
Stuff like that happens. You can not trust everyone.

272
00:49:07,248 --> 00:49:09,248
I am sorry. Sure.

273
00:49:13,249 --> 00:49:18,249
An offering of pace.De where did you get this? I changed something.

274
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:27,250
And that's not the only change here.

275
00:49:37,251 --> 00:49:41,251
Everyone here is evadati.Se seems that the Germans have decided to put the bad guys in one place.

276
00:49:43,252 --> 00:49:46,252
Aici.Oameni you everything you need to dig tunnels that break locks, anything you want.

277
00:49:48,253 --> 00:49:52,253
Welcome Fugitive Academy. He escaped anyone here?

278
00:49:53,254 --> 00:49:56,254
Yes, some friends last week but struggled like hell.

279
00:49:57,255 --> 00:49:59,255
Who's that? It's our big celebrity. Sawyer.

280
00:50:00,256 --> 00:50:02,256
A famous writer.

281
00:50:03,257 --> 00:50:07,257
I did not never heard of him. Me neither.

282
00:50:09,258 --> 00:50:11,258
He says he did the portrait of King before the war.

283
00:50:17,259 --> 00:50:20,259
Anyway, come to know him at Le Blanc. Not a bad guy for a thief.

284
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:23,260
He will make you acquainted with some of the other guys.

285
00:50:27,261 --> 00:50:29,261
That's yours.

286
00:50:32,262 --> 00:50:34,262
Alright guys.

287
00:50:35,263 --> 00:50:39,263
Fancy that's Johnny Barnes. Nice to meet you sir.

288
00:50:41,264 --> 00:50:45,264
Is that Malon, most often can not do anything but do not catch you as you touch his books.

289
00:50:51,265 --> 00:50:56,265
Rommy and Hewitt, four escapes before. Two tunnels, one of the threads and once was disguised as an officer.

290
00:51:00,266 --> 00:51:02,266
Nice to meet you. Me too.

291
00:51:17,267 --> 00:51:19,267
Mr. Jack Rawles. The answer is no.

292
00:51:21,268 --> 00:51:23,268
But you would not even heard the question.

293
00:51:24,269 --> 00:51:28,269
You've heard that you are an artist and want to draw a picture of your girlfriend, that you're willing to give me 10 shillings.

294
00:51:34,270 --> 00:51:39,270
Leaves! Possible. On the other hand I came to tell you to give a new law in connection with all who are called Sawyer as

295
00:51:39,271 --> 00:51:42,271
a car waiting outside to take you home.

296
00:51:48,272 --> 00:51:50,272
The car that I think you missed it.

297
00:51:52,273 --> 00:51:54,273
Nice try.

298
00:51:57,274 --> 00:52:00,274
How much will it cost? More than you might imagine. Now become very boring.

299
00:52:10,275 --> 00:52:12,275
The lighter it is silver belonged to my grandfather.

300
00:52:15,276 --> 00:52:17,276
You just do not understand.

301
00:52:19,377 --> 00:52:21,377
What about this ring. That's all I have.

302
00:52:29,378 --> 00:52:31,378
Go away.

303
00:52:35,379 --> 00:52:37,379
Good.

304
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:41,380
You can then to keep that.

305
00:52:47,382 --> 00:52:51,382
Indian paint. Where did you get this?

306
00:52:57,383 --> 00:53:00,383
Well, Red Barket can get everything from guards.

307
00:53:03,384 --> 00:53:06,384
I thought help. Does not matter.

308
00:53:08,385 --> 00:53:10,385
Wait.

309
00:53:14,386 --> 00:53:16,386
Do you know what that means.

310
00:53:19,387 --> 00:53:23,387
What will work? Got a photo? Not quite, not exactly.

311
00:53:30,388 --> 00:53:32,388
Slightly lower.

312
00:53:34,389 --> 00:53:36,389
Yes, perfect.

313
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:44,390
A big, beautiful smile.

314
00:53:49,391 --> 00:53:52,391
I guess what I mean is ... more radiant.

315
00:54:00,392 --> 00:54:02,392
Let's get going.

316
00:54:07,393 --> 00:54:09,393
5 to 7, a little help on the table.

317
00:54:09,394 --> 00:54:10,394
Deserved? Of course.

318
00:54:24,395 --> 00:54:29,395
Are you going to stare at that wall for life? If you must.

319
00:54:44,396 --> 00:54:47,396
What is her name? Lizy.

320
00:54:50,397 --> 00:54:53,397
It would be wrong, but I like to look at Lizy and a stripped thought.

321
00:54:55,398 --> 00:54:58,398
Lighten up! Are you serious? I'm serious.

322
00:55:00,399 --> 00:55:04,399
You know quite well if you look at a beautiful girl can also see under clothes, in her true beauty.

323
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,400
Cam asa e.

324
00:55:20,401 --> 00:55:22,401
So I see it when I look at that wall.

325
00:55:35,402 --> 00:55:39,402
Good ziua.Buna. I'm glad I caught you.

326
00:55:39,403 --> 00:55:42,403
Jill, he is Lt. McGrade. It is Jill.Imi looks good.

327
00:55:44,404 --> 00:55:47,404
I was not sure if I'll remember to bring my mine.Sigur.

328
00:55:50,405 --> 00:55:52,405
I'll go then. Goodbye.

329
00:55:53,406 --> 00:55:56,406
You have some great news about Jack? Do you want to go for a drink?

330
00:55:57,408 --> 00:56:00,408
I'm kinda tired, but if something bad happened please tell me.

331
00:56:00,409 --> 00:56:03,409
There is nothing bad. In fact we think we know where he is.

332
00:56:06,410 --> 00:56:08,410
Where? Let me lead you.

333
00:56:12,411 --> 00:56:14,411
It is a maximum security prison, near LEIBZIG.

334
00:56:17,412 --> 00:56:19,412
It looks like to stay there for longer.

335
00:56:19,413 --> 00:56:22,413
But it's safe? Yes, we know.

336
00:56:24,414 --> 00:56:26,414
You are you know this and know that it is safe or not.

337
00:56:29,415 --> 00:56:32,415
Not so sure appreciate working simplu.Sunt asta.Desigur.

338
00:56:36,416 --> 00:56:39,416
It was nice of you to come, thank you very much.

339
00:56:44,417 --> 00:56:47,417
Come on, let me get you a drink. Jack is alive, we should celebrate. I do not feel desarbatorit.

340
00:56:50,418 --> 00:56:53,418
Because you leave affected by everything happening around you.

341
00:56:55,419 --> 00:56:57,419
Have you heard the bombing last night? Yes it was about rau.A was terrible.

342
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:03,420
I saw some things ... people died in our arms.

343
00:57:06,421 --> 00:57:09,421
Their lives ... destroyed in a second.

344
00:57:10,422 --> 00:57:13,422
Sorry ... you've probably heard this. "Do not let the bastards to get depressed. If I leave means they have won."

345
00:57:18,423 --> 00:57:21,423
It may not be dead but it's like you are.

346
00:57:24,424 --> 00:57:28,424
I'm sure it's a pub just around the corner. I am very tired. Thanks for coming, Lieutenant.

347
00:57:32,425 --> 00:57:34,425
Good. Tell me Nick. Please.

348
00:58:21,426 --> 00:58:23,426
E de la Lizy.

349
00:58:26,427 --> 00:58:28,427
Mcgrade returned and told where we are. We know we're safe.

350
00:58:30,428 --> 00:58:32,428
What he said damn corporal. There's a corporal, but is Lt. McGrade.

351
00:58:38,429 --> 00:58:40,429
I wish him luck. At least he got rid us.

352
00:58:42,430 --> 00:58:44,430
We'll do it we must.

353
00:58:53,431 --> 00:58:55,431
I reusit.Ce? I found the solution.

354
00:58:59,432 --> 00:59:03,432
Hewitt give me the binoculars guy, that all play voi.Vino Jack, I want to show you something.

355
00:59:15,433 --> 00:59:19,433
That window from the third floor does not have lights on at night. It means that the room is unused.

356
00:59:21,434 --> 00:59:23,434
Watch reflection. You see her? Not quite, not exactly.

357
00:59:23,435 --> 00:59:24,435
We came for help.

358
00:59:28,436 --> 00:59:30,436
Do you have a light?

359
00:59:35,437 --> 00:59:37,437
I think reflects that means that there is a window in that room.

360
00:59:39,438 --> 00:59:42,438
A room that give acoperis.Daca reach the acoperis..am escaped.

361
00:59:44,439 --> 00:59:47,439
But how do we get in that room? The cart, my dear.

362
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:26,440
That's it. Bingo!

363
01:00:28,441 --> 01:00:30,441
Let's see who gets first. Dam with money.

364
01:00:36,442 --> 01:00:38,442
You're skinny anyway.

365
01:00:48,443 --> 01:00:50,443
Are you ready? Yes.

366
01:01:17,444 --> 01:01:19,444
You should reach.

367
01:02:04,445 --> 01:02:06,445
Not a window, it's a goddamn mirror.

368
01:02:54,446 --> 01:02:56,446
We do not have to go around. Main guards are there.

369
01:03:06,447 --> 01:03:10,447
It looks like we have no choice. Those guards have to move.

370
01:03:13,448 --> 01:03:15,448
Germans guys is something that we all uitati.Si who's that?

371
01:03:17,549 --> 01:03:19,549
As nemtesti wearing uniforms. Who makes them?

372
01:03:22,550 --> 01:03:24,550
There must be someone here who pote make us get some uniforms.

373
01:03:27,551 --> 01:03:29,551
Buddy Lindom. A Dutchman who will have to take it with you.

374
01:03:33,552 --> 01:03:35,552
But we must find him first.

375
01:05:12,553 --> 01:05:14,553
After you, old man.

376
01:05:17,553 --> 01:05:19,553
It's better this way. But to sit with your back straight.

377
01:05:22,554 --> 01:05:25,554
But we will not march but we leave here

378
01:05:28,555 --> 01:05:30,555
Like me.

379
01:05:49,556 --> 01:05:51,556
Can you see?

380
01:05:57,557 --> 01:05:59,557
That's all I can do.

381
01:06:01,558 --> 01:06:03,558
Damn, how did you do stamps?

382
01:06:05,559 --> 01:06:09,559
Poftim.Nu not keep them. Are you sure?

383
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:14,560
You can come along with us.

384
01:06:16,561 --> 01:06:18,561
I'm afraid not much of a team player, but thank you.

385
01:06:21,562 --> 01:06:23,562
Who's that? What? There.

386
01:06:25,563 --> 01:06:28,563
Ala is Willy electrician. He came to repair the light.

387
01:07:01,564 --> 01:07:03,564
You are late.

388
01:07:06,565 --> 01:07:08,565
You solved? Price increased.

389
01:07:10,566 --> 01:07:12,566
These are all the money that I have.

390
01:07:17,567 --> 01:07:19,567
I think we get along with these guys.

391
01:07:21,568 --> 01:07:24,568
Grade sheath or ...

392
01:07:39,569 --> 01:07:41,569
You fooled.

393
01:08:31,570 --> 01:08:33,570
Hey how are you?

394
01:08:45,571 --> 01:08:47,571
Fuck!

395
01:08:48,571 --> 01:08:50,571
What happens?

396
01:08:51,572 --> 01:08:53,572
It's a power outage.

397
01:11:25,573 --> 01:11:27,573
So far everything is going well.

398
01:12:02,574 --> 01:12:04,574
Stop.

399
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:11,575
Do not even think about it.

400
01:12:12,576 --> 01:12:14,576
Don't move.

401
01:12:15,577 --> 01:12:19,577
Tony, Tony! Now!

402
01:12:51,578 --> 01:12:53,578
Very good. But not enough.

403
01:12:59,579 --> 01:13:01,579
Take it back!

404
01:14:28,580 --> 01:14:30,580
Jesus!

405
01:14:34,581 --> 01:14:37,581
I know it looks a bit unconventional, but it should be.

406
01:14:39,582 --> 01:14:43,582
We know that will never end ideas of escape, the problem is disguising.

407
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:45,583
Here come into play these guys. Gentlemen!

408
01:14:50,584 --> 01:14:52,584
End and pull out a knife.

409
01:14:54,585 --> 01:14:58,585
Put it back and inside is ... no, not out

410
01:15:01,586 --> 01:15:03,586
It should be a vial. Of course I used to ...

411
01:15:05,587 --> 01:15:07,587
I think the assistant's fault.

412
01:15:09,588 --> 01:15:14,588
Dinti.O paste squeeze and after a while becomes gray. The same color as the German uniforms.

413
01:15:23,589 --> 01:15:25,589
A tin of beans. An open and have ... damn.

414
01:15:34,590 --> 01:15:39,590
A false bottom, is a piece of silk inside.

415
01:15:40,591 --> 01:15:43,591
Perfect for hiding. Silk is a model very nice.

416
01:15:44,592 --> 01:15:47,592
It is actually a detailed map by Bavaria to the Swiss border.

417
01:15:50,593 --> 01:15:52,593
This man is a genius. You're an asshole.

418
01:15:54,594 --> 01:15:56,594
Lighten up old! You've demonstrated point of view.

419
01:15:57,595 --> 01:16:02,595
Not really, the other capat..vezi there beans. Just as written on the label

420
01:16:09,596 --> 01:16:11,596
The most practical and useful of evedare.

421
01:16:15,597 --> 01:16:18,597
A nuca.Nu is a nut. It's a compass.

422
01:16:27,598 --> 01:16:31,598
And finally, from the British Museum ...

423
01:16:33,599 --> 01:16:35,599
a grand plan Colditz Castle.

424
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:43,600
Look at this matter. They are brilliant.

425
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:47,601
You could go with them throughout Europe.

426
01:17:00,602 --> 01:17:02,602
It was a good show.

427
01:17:08,603 --> 01:17:10,603
I think we should pass on to those operations, let's shake her.

428
01:17:12,604 --> 01:17:14,604
Yes, sir.

429
01:17:19,605 --> 01:17:21,605
If you put a metal wire in a siret.Ce you?

430
01:17:23,606 --> 01:17:25,606
A saw. That you.

431
01:17:29,607 --> 01:17:31,607
You know, you're just as dumb as people think you are.

432
01:17:32,608 --> 01:17:34,608
Excuse me sir. Of course.

433
01:17:45,609 --> 01:17:47,609
Move here buddy.

434
01:17:49,610 --> 01:17:51,610
Now that's a surprise.

435
01:17:56,611 --> 01:17:58,611
It bothers you? Not.

436
01:18:03,612 --> 01:18:05,612
Maybe I am pleased to speak to this gentleman.

437
01:18:10,613 --> 01:18:12,613
Yes it's fucking este.Te thought that, but were too polite to tell.

438
01:18:13,614 --> 01:18:15,614
I like you. Just doing my job.

439
01:18:18,615 --> 01:18:22,615
I never thought you agree with this. Follow your advice, you should be happy. There are, believe me.

440
01:18:28,616 --> 01:18:30,616
I just got word from Jack last week.

441
01:18:35,617 --> 01:18:39,617
I received a letter. Hoping bine.Asa seems.

442
01:18:45,618 --> 01:18:47,618
El e cam optimist, dar asa e Jack.

443
01:18:50,619 --> 01:18:52,619
You do not seem happy. No, thanks ...

444
01:18:55,620 --> 01:18:57,620
... just is ... difficult. Yes.

445
01:19:01,621 --> 01:19:03,621
I feel that I live life every day and ...

446
01:19:08,622 --> 01:19:10,622
and I have a lot of things that revolve my head.

447
01:19:12,623 --> 01:19:15,623
Sometimes even ... Whatever.

448
01:19:17,624 --> 01:19:19,624
Sometimes you do not remember what it looks like.

449
01:19:22,625 --> 01:19:24,625
Neobisnuit.Asa not happen, it should not be ashamed.

450
01:19:26,626 --> 01:19:30,626
But I feel so guilty. You have nothing to feel guilty. This is war and you have a life of your own.

451
01:19:38,627 --> 01:19:40,627
And if not I could be dead.

452
01:19:43,628 --> 01:19:46,628
You have to pay me for it. Oh no, oh yes.

453
01:19:48,629 --> 01:19:50,629
What? A dance with me.

454
01:19:51,630 --> 01:19:54,630
I have to think about it. A dance with me even if you have to crawl up there.

455
01:21:10,631 --> 01:21:12,631
I should go, it's late.

456
01:21:14,632 --> 01:21:16,632
You're somehow turn into a pumpkin.

457
01:21:20,633 --> 01:21:24,633
Lizy, asteapta.Te lead you back. No, I'll handle it.

458
01:21:26,634 --> 01:21:28,634
Let me get my purse.

459
01:21:39,635 --> 01:21:41,635
Approaching again.

460
01:21:43,636 --> 01:21:45,636
We should go to the shelter.

461
01:21:49,637 --> 01:21:53,637
It's very beautiful! How can you say that! People die there.

462
01:21:54,638 --> 01:21:57,638
You want me to win? I do not want us to win.

463
01:22:00,639 --> 01:22:02,639
I was nothing before all this started.

464
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:09,640
We should go to the shelter.

465
01:22:15,641 --> 01:22:17,641
You all right?

466
01:22:29,642 --> 01:22:31,642
We must get out of here.

467
01:22:42,643 --> 01:22:44,643
What are you doing? Nick!

468
01:22:48,644 --> 01:22:50,644
We are in the midst of war Lizy. Come on!

469
01:23:01,645 --> 01:23:04,645
I may feel heart Lizy, that's how life is struggling inside you.

470
01:23:08,646 --> 01:23:10,646
Everything is blown. And suddenly it was all over.

471
01:23:16,647 --> 01:23:18,647
We're just us now.

472
01:23:20,648 --> 01:23:24,648
We can do whatever we want. We can be what we want.

473
01:23:27,649 --> 01:23:29,649
We have what we want.

474
01:23:33,650 --> 01:23:35,650
I want you!

475
01:23:45,651 --> 01:23:47,651
Not!

476
01:23:48,652 --> 01:23:50,652
Lizy!

477
01:24:08,653 --> 01:24:10,653
Tell us confirm his identity number.

478
01:24:11,654 --> 01:24:12,654
What's the commotion? Someone escaped from Colditz.

479
01:24:15,655 --> 01:24:17,655
Who? I do not know.

480
01:24:31,656 --> 01:24:36,656
Sherpshire royal infantry. Captain Edward Sawyer.

481
01:24:45,657 --> 01:24:47,657
Contact regiment and learn as much as you can about it.

482
01:24:49,658 --> 01:24:53,658
Who runs our shelter in Marseille? Mrs. M.Spune I will be a guest.

483
01:24:55,659 --> 01:24:57,659
Danziger is an American agent that I wanted to use it.

484
01:25:00,660 --> 01:25:04,660
If we can get him put it on the Baltic Sea in a boat to Sweden and take it from there.

485
01:25:05,661 --> 01:25:08,661
What do you think? Sounds good.

486
01:25:09,662 --> 01:25:13,662
Be happier man, this is the best news we have for several weeks now.

487
01:25:34,663 --> 01:25:37,663
I said you do not do anything else, I promit.De like I was born yesterday.

488
01:25:49,664 --> 01:25:51,664
I want you two to finish the job and ready to date.

489
01:25:58,665 --> 01:26:00,665
I think this is yours.

490
01:26:03,666 --> 01:26:05,666
It's just junk.

491
01:26:10,667 --> 01:26:12,667
Lizy.

492
01:26:15,668 --> 01:26:17,668
Lizy, look at me.

493
01:26:19,669 --> 01:26:21,669
Actually, I'm kinda busy. Not true.

494
01:26:23,670 --> 01:26:25,670
Last night was crazy. You could have killed us both.

495
01:26:27,671 --> 01:26:29,671
Was awesome. It was a mistake.

496
01:26:30,672 --> 01:26:32,672
There was no mistake, just know this thing.

497
01:26:33,673 --> 01:26:35,673
I made a promise. I love Jack.

498
01:26:38,674 --> 01:26:40,674
You can not wait forever. He might not return.

499
01:26:43,675 --> 01:26:45,675
You said something terrible. I'll be back.

500
01:26:53,676 --> 01:26:58,676
Look ... Lizy. Do not touch me please.

501
01:27:01,677 --> 01:27:05,677
I think you should leave. I want to go.

502
01:27:07,678 --> 01:27:09,678
I do not want to come back here. Lizy please!

503
01:27:09,679 --> 01:27:10,679
Lieutenant McGrade want to leave.

504
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:11,680
Lizy please! Get out!

505
01:27:30,681 --> 01:27:34,681
Mary! Hi, how are you?

506
01:27:35,682 --> 01:27:39,682
Would you do me a favor? That prisoner of Colditz, I know what has regiment.

507
01:27:40,683 --> 01:27:43,683
Of course. How I cheama.Rawles, Lt. Jack Rawles.Bine. Thank you.

508
01:27:47,684 --> 01:27:50,684
Arise! Your month is over.

509
01:28:10,685 --> 01:28:12,685
Good old!

510
01:28:26,686 --> 01:28:28,686
McGrade, MI9.

511
01:28:29,687 --> 01:28:31,687
Yes, sir.

512
01:28:32,688 --> 01:28:36,688
From now on I want all letters from Lt.Jack Rawles from Colditz to be sent to me.

513
01:28:39,689 --> 01:28:41,689
You do not have to know why.

514
01:28:42,690 --> 01:28:44,690
Yes, sir.

515
01:31:25,055 --> 01:31:27,055
See it's there!

516
01:31:47,056 --> 01:31:51,056
And of course what is particularly interesting here is the definition of a Soviet Truska. According to a Soviet is a ...

517
01:31:54,057 --> 01:31:57,057
Garbage is taken out in every Thursday. So we can to hide in it the night before. Let's see out the window!

518
01:32:00,058 --> 01:32:03,058
Does it mind? We apologise. Shut up, man, we're busy here! And we are.

519
01:32:06,059 --> 01:32:08,059
See, turn left and then right tower.

520
01:32:11,060 --> 01:32:13,060
Did not you tired of this childish obsessions about escape?

521
01:32:15,061 --> 01:32:17,061
If you want to rot here that's your job. What you said?

522
01:32:18,062 --> 01:32:21,062
Return to your communist bullshit! Goddamn you!

523
01:32:21,063 --> 01:32:23,063
Come here!

524
01:32:25,063 --> 01:32:27,063
Look Mulon, it seems you do not want to understand is that we rot here.

525
01:32:29,064 --> 01:32:32,064
Escaped French, Dutch and Polish. Everyone laughs at us.

526
01:32:33,065 --> 01:32:35,065
Why can not you see that?

527
01:32:48,066 --> 01:32:51,066
Le Blanc, look at him. What he wants?

528
01:32:51,067 --> 01:32:55,067
I think pants world. Oh yes.

529
01:32:57,068 --> 01:33:01,068
Barnes. Here. Raise your hand! Or I'm flying out of here!

530
01:33:03,069 --> 01:33:05,069
What a gentleman!

531
01:33:08,070 --> 01:33:11,070
Hello. How are you?

532
01:33:25,071 --> 01:33:28,071
I heard a new escape plan on the guards. Correct.

533
01:33:30,072 --> 01:33:32,072
I fear that my people were planning the same escape.

534
01:33:34,073 --> 01:33:36,073
What a shame.

535
01:33:37,074 --> 01:33:39,074
It's just one thing we can do.

536
01:33:43,075 --> 01:33:45,075
Dam with money!

537
01:33:52,076 --> 01:33:54,076
I can not believe.

538
01:33:56,077 --> 01:33:58,077
I can not believe.

539
01:33:59,078 --> 01:34:01,078
I always luck.

540
01:34:09,079 --> 01:34:12,079
Data-goes or part!

541
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:27,080
Another failed attempt. The more failed attempts the less chance for us to escape.

542
01:34:36,081 --> 01:34:40,081
Here I come again. Jill, get away from the window.

543
01:34:41,082 --> 01:34:45,082
I think we should go to the shelter. There will be leaving soon.

544
01:34:46,083 --> 01:34:51,083
Anyway, what's the point? Look, I know what happened to Jack's horrible but I have to move on.

545
01:34:55,084 --> 01:34:58,084
You have to go on. Otherwise even they win. So everyone tells me.

546
01:35:06,085 --> 01:35:09,085
You did it with Jack?

547
01:35:12,086 --> 01:35:14,086
You did it? Not.

548
01:35:17,087 --> 01:35:19,087
But have you kissed.

549
01:35:20,088 --> 01:35:22,088
You did anyone ever? Not.

550
01:35:24,089 --> 01:35:26,089
So you did any of the other? Which?

551
01:35:27,090 --> 01:35:29,090
You know. Lieutenant Nicholas McGrade.

552
01:35:32,091 --> 01:35:35,091
No, I did. But have you kissed.

553
01:35:36,092 --> 01:35:39,092
What is this. Not interested in you. I'll take that as a positive response.

554
01:35:46,093 --> 01:35:48,093
I think you should do with it.

555
01:35:48,094 --> 01:35:52,094
Think you've been keeping you very long for that special person.

556
01:35:53,095 --> 01:35:56,095
And suddenly bang. You inbolnavesti or die. And you do not grab it before.

557
01:35:58,096 --> 01:36:00,096
Never.

558
01:36:01,097 --> 01:36:04,097
,, I call this tragic situation. '' I think this does not apply to you?

559
01:36:08,098 --> 01:36:10,098
That was close.

560
01:36:11,099 --> 01:36:15,099
Go to the shelter? It's a bit late now. But the lights were off.

561
01:36:17,100 --> 01:36:20,100
However, if it hits you and hits you over.

562
01:36:32,101 --> 01:36:34,101
Excuse me.

563
01:36:51,102 --> 01:36:55,102
Thank God you're all right. I learned that you were hit.

564
01:37:11,103 --> 01:37:13,103
Your face does not look too great. But it's not changed anything.

565
01:37:22,104 --> 01:37:25,104
I no longer feel my head, sir.

566
01:37:33,105 --> 01:37:35,105
It'll be all right girl.

567
01:37:45,106 --> 01:37:47,106
It was nice of you for coming.

568
01:37:48,107 --> 01:37:50,107
A boy to tell him to move his ass back here immediately.

569
01:37:51,108 --> 01:37:54,108
You know Jack? Yes.

570
01:37:59,109 --> 01:38:02,109
I wanted to come and see you. But I was not sure if you do not.

571
01:38:05,110 --> 01:38:07,110
Do not know what happened.

572
01:38:12,111 --> 01:38:15,111
From what I heard, he was shot while trying to escape.

573
01:38:19,112 --> 01:38:21,112
Is everything okay? I do not know anymore.

574
01:38:26,113 --> 01:38:28,113
I am sorry.

575
01:38:28,114 --> 01:38:29,114
He was a brave man and good.

576
01:38:33,115 --> 01:38:35,115
I would have never wanted to happen that. Know.

577
01:38:40,116 --> 01:38:42,116
I am sorry. Lizy ...

578
01:39:00,117 --> 01:39:02,117
I do not think I can live ... I know, I know.

579
01:39:05,118 --> 01:39:07,118
You know where to find me.

580
01:39:12,119 --> 01:39:14,119
Thank you.

581
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:19,120
We can see as friends.

582
01:39:20,121 --> 01:39:22,121
Good.

583
01:39:34,122 --> 01:39:36,122
We have to start out as many people there.

584
01:39:37,123 --> 01:39:40,123
And if we succeed, these routes must be updated. And be safe.

585
01:39:41,124 --> 01:39:43,124
Of course. A sending you here. Eager Stein's our man inside.

586
01:39:44,125 --> 01:39:45,125
He'll be your eyes and ears.

587
01:39:46,126 --> 01:39:48,126
These must be safe routes to France. We have several options available.

588
01:39:51,127 --> 01:39:53,127
Better work here, same thing. Not.

589
01:39:54,128 --> 01:39:58,128
This job is for you. Do you think you're doing?

590
01:40:00,129 --> 01:40:03,129
Yes, sir. Good.

591
01:40:06,130 --> 01:40:09,130
However, I fear that will not stick around for long. How so?

592
01:40:11,131 --> 01:40:13,131
Ti found as a replacement.

593
01:40:45,132 --> 01:40:47,132
Captain Sawyer, I suppose.

594
01:40:48,133 --> 01:40:50,133
Welcome to MI9.

595
01:40:51,134 --> 01:40:53,134
Good back? Oddish.

596
01:40:53,135 --> 01:40:56,135
They told me you're an artist. I was.

597
01:40:57,136 --> 01:41:00,136
I'm sure you regain your talent. Painting is like riding a bicycle.

598
01:41:02,137 --> 01:41:05,137
Let me introduce you to another one that escaped. McGrade.

599
01:41:09,138 --> 01:41:12,138
You get to handle his duties. I'll tell him how it works.

600
01:41:17,139 --> 01:41:20,139
Let me show you around.

601
01:41:20,140 --> 01:41:22,140
Hewitt.

602
01:41:24,141 --> 01:41:26,141
Manning.

603
01:41:28,142 --> 01:41:30,142
Lance yes I am.

604
01:41:37,143 --> 01:41:40,143
Lizy's from? It's from a man who heard of it. From whom you have received?

605
01:41:41,144 --> 01:41:44,144
Christmas came early guys. Well let's get back to our business.

606
01:41:52,145 --> 01:41:55,145
What is this? What are those? Discs.

607
01:41:56,146 --> 01:42:00,146
Did you find anything good there? Beans. Oh Lord, if you can not like hell here!

608
01:42:03,147 --> 01:42:05,147
Either it is better than the food that we give here.

609
01:42:07,148 --> 01:42:09,148
A small change from the crap you put Willis us to listen.

610
01:42:27,149 --> 01:42:29,149
It's not for nothing that!

611
01:42:31,150 --> 01:42:33,150
See if it's good?

612
01:42:48,151 --> 01:42:50,151
It's a map.

613
01:42:52,152 --> 01:42:54,152
Who says you sent that?

614
01:42:55,153 --> 01:42:57,153
Mrs. Maplin. You know Mrs. Maplin?

615
01:43:00,154 --> 01:43:04,154
And I thought that the British invented pickup. But that's your problem, huh?

616
01:43:05,155 --> 01:43:08,155
Invent things others have to build.

617
01:43:09,156 --> 01:43:11,156
Guys I think it's a code. Do not get carried away.

618
01:43:13,157 --> 01:43:15,157
Check everything else.

619
01:43:23,158 --> 01:43:25,158
I'll take this one.

620
01:43:37,159 --> 01:43:39,159
Look what's here.

621
01:43:43,160 --> 01:43:45,160
What's that? It's a telescope.

622
01:43:52,161 --> 01:43:55,161
What did you find there? Numic, these were only discs.

623
01:44:16,162 --> 01:44:18,162
You saw that back?

624
01:44:34,163 --> 01:44:36,163
Well I have not slept.

625
01:44:45,164 --> 01:44:47,164
A good evening. A good evening Miss Carter.

626
01:44:48,165 --> 01:44:50,165
A good evening.

627
01:44:56,166 --> 01:44:58,166
Well, good night.

628
01:44:59,167 --> 01:45:02,167
God Lizy, you must give me something. I feel like going crazy.

629
01:45:03,168 --> 01:45:05,168
I have to go. Thank you. Not. Please!

630
01:45:06,169 --> 01:45:08,169
Haide Lizy, you can not waste your life for nothing.

631
01:45:09,170 --> 01:45:11,170
Please, Nick. It's a memory. A fantasy.

632
01:45:13,171 --> 01:45:15,171
I need time. You do not have time. None of us has.

633
01:45:19,172 --> 01:45:21,172
I am sorry.

634
01:45:23,173 --> 01:45:25,173
I leave here. You go?

635
01:45:26,174 --> 01:45:28,174
Gives.

636
01:45:29,175 --> 01:45:31,175
I should ... I can not see you.

637
01:45:33,176 --> 01:45:35,176
Where? For how long?

638
01:45:36,177 --> 01:45:38,177
Lizy, you will not see him ever Jack.

639
01:45:40,178 --> 01:45:42,178
There could not see me or me.

640
01:46:09,179 --> 01:46:11,179
If you want to help us. Move it, move.

641
01:46:18,180 --> 01:46:20,180
Came reinforcements. Since the French escape.

642
01:46:24,181 --> 01:46:26,181
More weapons. More guards.

643
01:46:31,182 --> 01:46:33,182
What the hell is that?

644
01:46:37,183 --> 01:46:39,183
A German physicist discovered x-rays.

645
01:46:45,184 --> 01:46:47,184
They want radiography packages.

646
01:46:53,185 --> 01:46:55,185
We have to get our hands on packages before they radiography.

647
01:46:57,186 --> 01:47:00,186
I think I'll join him cumunistilor Malone's. Haide Jack can not quit now.

648
01:47:12,187 --> 01:47:14,187
What are you doing? Oh Lord, prostovanule.

649
01:47:16,188 --> 01:47:19,188
I was to blow my finger. What do you want?

650
01:47:20,189 --> 01:47:22,189
Go. I left a note.

651
01:47:30,190 --> 01:47:32,190
I refer to the Italian border.

652
01:47:34,191 --> 01:47:37,191
Must provide some routes. And you want a kiss?

653
01:47:38,192 --> 01:47:40,192
Not from you.

654
01:47:45,193 --> 01:47:47,193
Are you married?

655
01:47:47,194 --> 01:47:48,194
Yes, like a coconut, which is hollow.

656
01:47:51,195 --> 01:47:55,195
I have not told you? Want to give you some friendly advice? You will not get it here.

657
01:47:58,196 --> 01:48:00,196
You should take one of these with you.

658
01:48:01,197 --> 01:48:03,197
It is all I can do.

659
01:48:04,198 --> 01:48:07,198
A piece of chocolate, two chocolates, matches, magnetized blade and some nylon fishing.

660
01:48:13,199 --> 01:48:15,199
Do not catch a fish and keep your pants up.

661
01:48:16,200 --> 01:48:18,200
Thank you.

662
01:48:19,201 --> 01:48:22,201
I give the bunker after all. Nobody will bother me there. Perfect.

663
01:48:25,102 --> 01:48:27,102
Hopefully I will not be here when you return. If I ever return.

664
01:48:28,103 --> 01:48:31,103
You'll come back. You die young Ala luck.

665
01:48:38,104 --> 01:48:41,104
Macey greet and said that she and the girls will come to see you as soon as I can.

666
01:48:45,105 --> 01:48:47,105
Macey, that with big boobs.

667
01:48:49,106 --> 01:48:52,106
One that has bad breath and smelly feet.

668
01:48:55,107 --> 01:48:58,107
He came to see you the boy that? Which?

669
01:48:59,108 --> 01:49:02,108
You know, the one who works with Nick.

670
01:49:04,109 --> 01:49:06,109
Call.

671
01:49:10,110 --> 01:49:12,110
However I did not like.

672
01:49:16,111 --> 01:49:19,111
At least you managed to ...

673
01:49:23,112 --> 01:49:26,112
Do not complain that they deserve.

674
01:49:29,113 --> 01:49:32,113
I never ... What you ...

675
01:49:33,114 --> 01:49:35,114
did.

676
01:49:36,115 --> 01:49:39,115
But I thought ... I wanted to believe that ...

677
01:49:40,116 --> 01:49:43,116
It was the only thing I had done it you do not.

678
01:49:44,117 --> 01:49:46,117
Jill. Who's gonna want me now, Lizy?

679
01:49:48,118 --> 01:49:51,118
Or they want. Of course they'll want you.

680
01:50:09,119 --> 01:50:12,119
The top floor, door near corner. Thank you.

681
01:51:18,120 --> 01:51:20,120
Go back Nick!

682
01:51:21,121 --> 01:51:24,121
I'll be back. Believe me that I will return.

683
01:51:26,122 --> 01:51:28,122
Please come back.

684
01:52:06,123 --> 01:52:09,123
That, gentlemen, is a cross-shaped clasp. Yes it is very beautiful, why we can not break?

685
01:52:12,124 --> 01:52:14,124
Well it looks a conventional mechanism.

686
01:52:14,124 --> 01:52:16,124
We can force? Not.

687
01:52:22,125 --> 01:52:25,125
His name that one, olendezul that? Van Dahl. Give it.

688
01:52:26,126 --> 01:52:29,126
Van de Boer. Is not it their locksmith. We could ask but do not tell us.

689
01:52:30,127 --> 01:52:32,127
Why not?

690
01:52:33,128 --> 01:52:35,128
It is deaf and dumb.

691
01:52:49,129 --> 01:52:52,129
He can help you. Tell me the price, what does?

692
01:52:56,130 --> 01:53:00,130
Escape. What? With us?

693
01:53:01,131 --> 01:53:05,131
We want to go through a vent hole to go on the roof at a height of 50 m and descend to the other side.

694
01:53:11,132 --> 01:53:14,132
We'll move like shit hard Calm down. Can we get rid of it.

695
01:53:19,133 --> 01:53:22,133
Good. You have a week available.

696
01:53:43,134 --> 01:53:46,134
Hi. Lord Willis!

697
01:53:47,135 --> 01:53:49,135
You all right?

698
01:54:00,136 --> 01:54:02,136
And you started with your games?

699
01:54:05,137 --> 01:54:08,137
Three people have escaped our all while you're lalaiesti.

700
01:54:10,138 --> 01:54:13,138
Yes, and a hundred were caught.

701
01:54:36,139 --> 01:54:38,139
Pathetic.

702
01:54:39,140 --> 01:54:42,140
Did you know that the Germans have reduced guards guarding the shed just to draw in trap.

703
01:54:45,141 --> 01:54:48,141
All your disguises and fake uniforms and your tunnels are in vain.

704
01:54:52,142 --> 01:54:54,142
A direct fall to them in the net.

705
01:54:54,143 --> 01:54:57,143
Comunistule Maybe you're right, but I like.

706
01:55:00,144 --> 01:55:02,144
Lieutenant think again.

707
01:55:46,145 --> 01:55:48,145
It's free guys!

708
01:56:56,146 --> 01:56:58,146
Hurry!

709
01:57:19,147 --> 01:57:21,147
Good. Let's go! Bunny Good luck!

710
01:58:19,148 --> 01:58:21,148
Up there!

711
01:58:23,149 --> 01:58:25,149
Do not pull.

712
01:58:26,150 --> 01:58:28,250
Do not pull. E deaf, can not hear you.

713
01:58:38,251 --> 01:58:40,251
Let it get to me.

714
01:58:45,252 --> 01:58:47,252
Damn.

715
01:58:51,253 --> 01:58:53,253
What happens?

716
01:58:54,254 --> 01:58:56,254
Nu e ala Jack Rawles si
Willis e cu el.

717
01:59:10,255 --> 01:59:12,255
Grab the rope!

718
01:59:16,256 --> 01:59:18,256
Come on!

719
01:59:20,257 --> 01:59:22,257
He took it. Come on! So!

720
01:59:37,258 --> 01:59:39,258
I hope you're proud of yourself.

721
01:59:44,259 --> 01:59:46,259
I know that dead prisoner's body found behind was examined.

722
01:59:49,260 --> 01:59:52,260
I am happy to say that my men shot him. It has no bullet wound.

723
01:59:57,261 --> 02:00:01,261
A man escapes, but other die trying. His death is entirely your responsibility.

724
02:00:05,262 --> 02:00:08,262
I hope you can live with that thought, gentlemen.

725
02:00:11,263 --> 02:00:13,263
And to think about before next time.

726
02:00:41,364 --> 02:00:43,364
25. You said 20.

727
02:00:46,365 --> 02:00:48,365
Wait. Wait.

728
02:00:49,366 --> 02:00:52,366
This is gonna get him! Just give me time ... I'll get him!

729
02:01:10,367 --> 02:01:12,367
My lucky coin.

730
02:01:36,368 --> 02:01:38,368
Look here! I brought you something.

731
02:01:48,369 --> 02:01:50,369
Where are my clothes?

732
02:02:10,370 --> 02:02:12,470
Motherfucker!

733
02:02:59,371 --> 02:03:01,371
It ended months.

734
02:03:06,372 --> 02:03:08,372
Good old!

735
02:03:30,373 --> 02:03:32,373
Come on!

736
02:03:37,374 --> 02:03:40,374
By the way...

737
02:03:39,375 --> 02:03:42,375
I left everyone to leave. Besides you.

738
02:03:47,376 --> 02:03:49,376
Merry Christmas!

739
02:03:56,377 --> 02:03:59,377
You're back! What happened?

740
02:04:00,378 --> 02:04:02,378
In fact, old everything goes well.

741
02:04:06,379 --> 02:04:09,379
Who came to us guys? Hello sir.

742
02:04:12,380 --> 02:04:15,380
As before, the third window. I think I deserve to see that after a month the state alone.

743
02:04:18,381 --> 02:04:20,381
Still appear to show off those beauties.

744
02:04:26,382 --> 02:04:28,382
This place is stagnant!

745
02:04:33,383 --> 02:04:35,383
What is this?

746
02:04:38,384 --> 02:04:40,384
Where is the portrait? Haide Jack, there's no time for that.

747
02:04:45,385 --> 02:04:47,385
Where's my picture?

748
02:04:48,386 --> 02:04:50,386
Where is? Jack, Jack.

749
02:04:50,387 --> 02:04:51,387
Which of you I ... Jack

750
02:04:54,388 --> 02:04:57,388
I will kill you all. Lighten up, wake the neighbors.

751
02:04:59,389 --> 02:05:02,389
Keep. Did not you see how these guys do when they see a woman?

752
02:05:05,390 --> 02:05:07,390
Good. Now let's tell the boys about the next plan.

753
02:05:12,391 --> 02:05:14,391
Do not you see I'm only hopes up, Willis?

754
02:05:15,392 --> 02:05:17,392
None of us will escape from here. Benny escaped.

755
02:05:18,393 --> 02:05:20,393
Deaf and mute? Jack's war, people die.

756
02:05:24,394 --> 02:05:26,394
I did not have to die.

757
02:05:28,395 --> 02:05:30,395
Lizy and what about?

758
02:05:33,396 --> 02:05:36,396
You know it's a beautiful girl. I thought I want to go back as soon as possible.

759
02:05:38,397 --> 02:05:41,397
You know what happens when the cat's home. Shut up, Willis!

760
02:05:43,398 --> 02:05:46,398
Shut up!

761
02:05:48,399 --> 02:05:50,399
You do wishful thinking, Jack.

762
02:05:52,900 --> 02:05:56,900
It will not be impressed when they find out that the man I expected too leave to come back to it.

763
02:05:58,901 --> 02:06:00,901
Jack.

764
02:06:02,902 --> 02:06:05,902
What are you looking at?

765
02:06:11,903 --> 02:06:14,903
I was behind that wall. And makes us fear for the patrols were on the other side.

766
02:06:15,904 --> 02:06:19,904
And how did you manage to escape? I hid in a truck.

767
02:06:24,905 --> 02:06:27,905
Only you know me. Shape each time.

768
02:06:29,906 --> 02:06:31,906
Sawyer, come here.

769
02:06:32,907 --> 02:06:34,907
Bravo. Thank you.

770
02:06:35,908 --> 02:06:38,908
Give the man something to drink that. Give him a beer and put it on my account.

771
02:06:49,909 --> 02:06:52,909
You came back! I returned.

772
02:06:59,910 --> 02:07:01,910
You're beautiful! You are so beautiful!

773
02:07:02,911 --> 02:07:04,911
So beautiful that you come to drink before coming to me.

774
02:07:05,912 --> 02:07:08,912
Duty. I was not until I returned. I missed you.

775
02:07:10,913 --> 02:07:12,913
I missed you too.

776
02:07:12,914 --> 02:07:14,914
Come and get to know the guys.

777
02:07:15,915 --> 02:07:17,915
Ladies and gentlemen I would like to introduce you to the most beautiful woman in the world.

778
02:07:21,916 --> 02:07:23,916
Lizy Carter.
Buna.

779
02:07:25,917 --> 02:07:27,917
Do you want to drink something? Yes.

780
02:07:28,918 --> 02:07:30,918
Who is? McGrade's girlfriend.

781
02:07:32,919 --> 02:07:34,919
Two whiskey please.

782
02:07:35,920 --> 02:07:37,920
Extraordinary. I drew it once. And went quite well.

783
02:07:39,921 --> 02:07:41,921
One in Colditz. There must be boyfriend.

784
02:07:42,922 --> 02:07:45,922
Since he died McGrade not let alone. You can not blame him, right?

785
02:07:45,923 --> 02:07:47,923
Jack Rawles is dead? It was shot while trying to escape.

786
02:07:50,924 --> 02:07:52,924
You want one? No, thanks.

787
02:08:02,925 --> 02:08:04,925
I think you'll be rewarded. A medal. Yes.

788
02:08:05,926 --> 02:08:07,926
It's kind of confidential for now. No need to let everyone know.

789
02:08:09,927 --> 02:08:12,927
You? Yes, why not me. There is not great.

790
02:08:15,928 --> 02:08:18,928
I should tell you something. I love war. Do not say that Nick.

791
02:08:19,929 --> 02:08:21,929
It is only pain and suffering.

792
02:08:22,930 --> 02:08:24,930
Are we unhappy? Not.

793
02:08:27,931 --> 02:08:31,931
Not right now. Now I am very happy.

794
02:08:34,932 --> 02:08:37,932
Even you would not be looking at me if it were not this war. We would not be here now.

795
02:08:38,933 --> 02:08:41,933
Yes, but many people have died. Yes but we are still here.

796
02:08:43,934 --> 02:08:45,934
It's like a jungle. Fight, survive. It's a beauty in that.

797
02:08:49,935 --> 02:08:51,935
What kind of medal is?

798
02:08:53,936 --> 02:08:55,936
One thing that shines.

799
02:08:56,937 --> 02:08:58,937
Why are you laughing? Nothing, do not be so impressed.

800
02:09:01,938 --> 02:09:04,938
Technically, our department does not exist.

801
02:09:05,939 --> 02:09:07,939
You exist. And I'm very proud of you.

802
02:09:12,940 --> 02:09:14,940
A to sprout something out of these ruins.

803
02:09:20,941 --> 02:09:22,941
And I'll be there when it happens.

804
02:09:25,942 --> 02:09:27,942
And you.

805
02:09:35,943 --> 02:09:37,943
I love you.

806
02:09:38,944 --> 02:09:40,944
God how I love you! Stay with me. Do not ever leave me!

807
02:09:45,946 --> 02:09:47,946
I did not understand a word the whole ceremony.

808
02:09:51,947 --> 02:09:54,947
A good show, though. Thank you sir.

809
02:09:57,948 --> 02:09:59,948
Do not tell me. Good job.

810
02:10:01,949 --> 02:10:03,949
I bring now sir. Do you want to know him and to tell him how it works.

811
02:10:04,950 --> 02:10:06,950
I'll talk to him. Because I know you want.

812
02:10:11,951 --> 02:10:13,951
View McGrade lose all updates.

813
02:10:14,952 --> 02:10:16,952
New escaped from Colditz.

814
02:10:27,953 --> 02:10:29,953
Hi Benny, I'm glad to see you.

815
02:10:30,954 --> 02:10:32,954
Sawyer, nebunaticu!

816
02:10:35,955 --> 02:10:38,955
What bothered us the best was that I did not get to see you in a disguise of yours.

817
02:10:39,956 --> 02:10:41,956
It was a capadopera. Especially mustache that I had.

818
02:10:45,957 --> 02:10:48,957
I was sorry to hear what happened to Jack Rawles. Jack?

819
02:10:49,958 --> 02:10:52,958
Yes, I heard he was shot while trying to escape.

820
02:10:53,959 --> 02:10:55,959
You did not know? It was shot?

821
02:10:57,960 --> 02:10:59,960
I have not seen anything official but rumors.

822
02:11:02,961 --> 02:11:04,961
Yes, I'm sorry.

823
02:11:06,962 --> 02:11:08,962
It was Tom Willis him?

824
02:11:09,963 --> 02:11:11,963
Come on, Sawyer must know something.

825
02:11:19,964 --> 02:11:21,964
Is everything okay? Yes.

826
02:11:22,965 --> 02:11:25,965
Got a minute? Of course. Excuse me gentlemen.

827
02:11:29,966 --> 02:11:31,966
Rawles? Yes, it says he was shot while trying to escape.

828
02:11:32,967 --> 02:11:35,967
Of course, the man from Colditz. Benny was friends with him and wants to know if you have more details.

829
02:11:37,968 --> 02:11:39,968
To my knowledge, no.

830
02:11:40,969 --> 02:11:42,969
But you know his beloved Lizy? Yes a little.

831
02:11:46,970 --> 02:11:48,970
I thought maybe he heard something. From relatives or ... Do not mix her in this business!

832
02:11:49,971 --> 02:11:51,971
Of course.

833
02:11:52,972 --> 02:11:54,972
It's been through a lot. Jack's death broke his heart.

834
02:11:59,973 --> 02:12:01,973
I just tried to keep her away from all this. Make me look.

835
02:12:02,974 --> 02:12:04,974
I understand.

836
02:12:06,975 --> 02:12:08,975
Probably best to leave it as is.

837
02:12:16,976 --> 02:12:19,976
Dear Jack, if you're alive and reading this letter

838
02:12:20,977 --> 02:12:23,977
then I think you did a great injustice.

839
02:12:26,978 --> 02:12:29,978
For more than a year in London everyone here thought you were killed

840
02:12:30,979 --> 02:12:32,979
While trying to escape from Colditz.

841
02:12:32,980 --> 02:12:35,980
Recent events led me to do some investigation.

842
02:12:39,981 --> 02:12:41,981
According to your regiment you're dead.

843
02:12:41,982 --> 02:12:44,982
But then I went to the Swiss consulate where they kept files on prisoners of war.

844
02:12:49,983 --> 02:12:51,983
And they told me they did not know anything about your death.

845
02:12:53,984 --> 02:12:55,984
It could be a typo,

846
02:12:55,985 --> 02:12:58,985
but then I began to wonder who would benefit from your death.

847
02:13:02,986 --> 02:13:05,986
Which brings me to the most difficult part of this letter.

848
02:13:08,987 --> 02:13:10,987
Oh Jackie, I think I know of who is scisoarea it.

849
02:13:14,988 --> 02:13:16,988
That's not her handwriting.

850
02:13:21,989 --> 02:13:23,989
I did not written anything for months.

851
02:13:44,990 --> 02:13:46,990
Here comes Jack zombie.

852
02:13:49,991 --> 02:13:52,991
I need to talk to you. Only one minutes. Now!

853
02:13:59,992 --> 02:14:02,992
I gotta get out of here! You can not come and give me orders!

854
02:14:06,993 --> 02:14:08,993
Read this! Read it!

855
02:14:28,994 --> 02:14:30,994
I am sorry.

856
02:14:36,995 --> 02:14:39,995
What plans have you done? I'm afraid things have changed little during your deception.

857
02:14:41,996 --> 02:14:44,996
Really? Your request will be argued before the committee.

858
02:14:45,997 --> 02:14:48,997
What? All plans must be approved and scheduled in order.

859
02:14:49,998 --> 02:14:51,998
No time for that crap, Willis! It's my life here.

860
02:14:53,999 --> 02:14:56,999
You have to wait your turn. I can not!

861
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:01,000
You wait your turn like everyone else, Lieutenant Rawles.

862
02:15:06,001 --> 02:15:08,001
Wait! Willis!

863
02:15:13,002 --> 02:15:15,002
I understand.

864
02:15:16,003 --> 02:15:19,003
Just tell me one thing. Who's next?

865
02:15:21,004 --> 02:15:23,004
Tell me please.

866
02:15:27,005 --> 02:15:29,005
I am.

867
02:15:37,006 --> 02:15:39,006
Mary, my daughter. I am sorry.

868
02:15:41,007 --> 02:15:44,007
My father. He grandee? Brigadier general.

869
02:15:46,008 --> 02:15:49,008
A war began last bottom. And stood up.

870
02:15:50,009 --> 02:15:52,009
Confusing story. That fathers.

871
02:15:54,010 --> 02:15:57,010
I am lucky in that regard. Mine was the seller.

872
02:15:59,011 --> 02:16:01,011
I remember everything. School games.

873
02:16:03,012 --> 02:16:05,012
Even when I was in scouts.

874
02:16:05,013 --> 02:16:08,013
I remember we put on me and my brother to raise the tent blindfolded.

875
02:16:13,014 --> 02:16:15,014
That was the best chance.

876
02:16:17,015 --> 02:16:19,015
The best!

877
02:16:24,016 --> 02:16:26,016
When I get out of here ...

878
02:16:36,017 --> 02:16:39,017
Tom Willis.
Ian Norbeck.

879
02:16:41,018 --> 02:16:44,018
I'll help you contact them in English. And is a good man, volunteered to come here.

880
02:16:49,019 --> 02:16:51,019
You have the necessary documents? Yes.

881
02:16:53,020 --> 02:16:55,020
German Cata you know? At all.

882
02:16:58,021 --> 02:17:01,021
You need help in Liebtzieg.

883
02:17:07,022 --> 02:17:10,022
When you get to go to church Liebtzieg St. Augustine. You meet with an escort.

884
02:17:18,023 --> 02:17:21,023
I'll be talking to you on the train German. And take you to the shelter of Orso.

885
02:17:24,024 --> 02:17:27,024
How will you escape tomorrow?

886
02:17:28,025 --> 02:17:30,025
On the northeast corner. It's a small window.

887
02:17:32,026 --> 02:17:35,026
Down, go along the wall on the terrace and then through the woods.

888
02:17:40,027 --> 02:17:43,027
Success! Thank you.

889
02:21:43,028 --> 02:21:45,028
Willis.

890
02:21:47,029 --> 02:21:49,029
Something is up. Coming from the east wall.

891
02:22:03,030 --> 02:22:05,030
Jesus will Rawles!

892
02:22:09,031 --> 02:22:11,031
Run Jack! Faster!

893
02:22:24,032 --> 02:22:26,032
Run! Move!

894
02:22:29,033 --> 02:22:31,033
You succeed.

895
02:23:05,034 --> 02:23:07,034
You knew! Motherfucker!

896
02:23:12,035 --> 02:23:14,035
He stole my plan of escape.

897
02:23:15,036 --> 02:23:18,036
Motherfuckers! It was my last chance.

898
02:23:44,037 --> 02:23:46,037
Move out! Scumbag!

899
02:24:04,038 --> 02:24:06,038
Bagami-as.

900
02:26:00,039 --> 02:26:02,039
It's great news guys.

901
02:26:03,040 --> 02:26:05,040
You heard? They say it is someone from Colditz.

902
02:26:06,041 --> 02:26:08,041
You know who he is. Lieutenant Jack Rawles.

903
02:26:10,042 --> 02:26:12,042
Good news.

904
02:26:12,043 --> 02:26:15,043
Congratulations. You know where he is now?

905
02:26:15,044 --> 02:26:18,044
Currently we do not know. But we think is going to Leibtzeig where he expects Poles.

906
02:26:21,045 --> 02:26:24,045
Do you want me to do this? In fact I would like to me to handle this problem sir.

907
02:26:25,046 --> 02:26:28,046
I was also in Colditz and you know Jack Rawles. He helped me to get out of there.

908
02:26:29,047 --> 02:26:32,047
I owe. McGrade of any objections? No sir.

909
02:26:33,048 --> 02:26:35,048
Then let go to work.

910
02:28:24,049 --> 02:28:27,049
Willis? No, Jack Rawles.Willis not escaped. Change of plans.

911
02:28:37,050 --> 02:28:40,050
Come! I'm not safe here.

912
02:29:02,051 --> 02:29:04,051
Not!

913
02:29:07,052 --> 02:29:09,052
Stay away from the window.

914
02:29:10,053 --> 02:29:13,053
I'll be back soon.

915
02:29:18,054 --> 02:29:20,054
Met liaison.

916
02:29:21,055 --> 02:29:24,055
The place is full of Germans. They have to keep him there for a while.

917
02:29:55,056 --> 02:29:57,056
Sawyer!

918
02:30:00,057 --> 02:30:03,057
We have to talk. Is that so?

919
02:30:08,058 --> 02:30:10,058
E cam melodramatic, nu-i asa?

920
02:30:11,059 --> 02:30:12,059
Tell me what you know about Jack Rawles.

921
02:30:12,060 --> 02:30:14,060
You tell me McGrade.

922
02:30:16,061 --> 02:30:18,061
Do not get smart with me, motherfucker!

923
02:30:19,062 --> 02:30:21,062
Well, I tell you.

924
02:30:23,063 --> 02:30:26,063
I think you fell in love with his girlfriend. I do not know how or where, but I think he was loyal to.

925
02:30:27,064 --> 02:30:29,064
I think maybe you become desperate, I do not know.

926
02:30:30,065 --> 02:30:32,065
Maybe you panicked.

927
02:30:32,066 --> 02:30:35,066
I think I have faked his death so that you may have on it. Do you think so?

928
02:30:36,067 --> 02:30:38,067
Someone thought safe. You do not believe?

929
02:30:48,068 --> 02:30:50,068
What will you do?

930
02:30:51,069 --> 02:30:53,069
Nothing. This story is about me only.

931
02:30:54,070 --> 02:30:57,070
Once Rawles will return will be between you and him. I did what had to be done.

932
02:30:57,071 --> 02:31:00,071
What do you want to say? How come you did the right thing?

933
02:31:06,072 --> 02:31:09,072
You told him. However learn sooner or later.

934
02:31:10,073 --> 02:31:13,073
Who knows? Who you said.

935
02:31:13,074 --> 02:31:15,074
Nobody.

936
02:31:16,075 --> 02:31:18,075
It's between you and him.

937
02:31:21,076 --> 02:31:23,076
It is too late McGrade.

938
02:31:26,077 --> 02:31:28,077
What do you think, man.

939
02:31:29,078 --> 02:31:31,078
You hoped never to return again.

940
02:31:31,079 --> 02:31:34,079
Or you thought comes back, he sees his girlfriend and says, quite correctly

941
02:31:34,080 --> 02:31:37,080
buddy, you've faked death is not so well, but all is fair in love and war '.

942
02:31:40,081 --> 02:31:44,081
He was obsessed with this girl. I made her draw from his memory. He knew every inch of his face.

943
02:31:44,082 --> 02:31:48,082
How have hair that had her lips as if it smelled as he described.

944
02:31:50,083 --> 02:31:53,083
Shut up!

945
02:31:59,084 --> 02:32:01,084
Sawyer!

946
02:32:08,085 --> 02:32:10,085
Sawyer!

947
02:33:27,086 --> 02:33:29,086
It's not me. Come friend!

948
02:33:31,087 --> 02:33:33,087
Do you have a train to catch.

949
02:33:41,088 --> 02:33:43,088
Prisoners will be moved.

950
02:33:44,089 --> 02:33:50,089
Decision has been taken by the command. From now on Colditz Castle will host the only British and American prisoners.

951
02:33:53,090 --> 02:33:56,090
Prisoners will be moved to Stanislau Dutch and the French in Liebeq.

952
02:33:59,091 --> 02:34:01,091
This will happen as soon as possible.

953
02:34:02,092 --> 02:34:04,092
This is all.

954
02:34:35,093 --> 02:34:39,093
I told you I'd get you out of here. They remained tools, documents and a tunnel that have worked for over a year.

955
02:34:41,094 --> 02:34:43,094
What do you owe?

956
02:34:44,095 --> 02:34:46,095
Besides money?

957
02:34:47,096 --> 02:34:50,096
House wife, eldest daughter. The French should not bet.

958
02:34:54,097 --> 02:34:56,097
Are you feeling alright?

959
02:34:57,098 --> 02:34:59,098
It's just the flu. I get over.

960
02:35:14,099 --> 02:35:17,099
Meisner? Jesus, why did it take so ...

961
02:35:23,100 --> 02:35:25,100
It will be executed in a week.

962
02:35:26,101 --> 02:35:28,101
He left it.

963
02:35:35,102 --> 02:35:37,102
Not yet!

964
02:35:39,103 --> 02:35:41,103
I think we will fall to a different understanding.

965
02:35:41,104 --> 02:35:44,104
I'm not interested in money.

966
02:35:58,105 --> 02:36:01,105
Excellent news. A to transmit on. Goodbye.

967
02:36:07,106 --> 02:36:09,106
Good morning. Good morning.

968
02:36:09,107 --> 02:36:10,107
Sawyer has not come yet? Not.

969
02:36:12,108 --> 02:36:15,108
Not too stand wires.

970
02:36:18,109 --> 02:36:21,109
How we decurcam? He arrived in Warsaw. Good for him.

971
02:36:23,110 --> 02:36:26,110
Do you know where? Covered.

972
02:36:26,111 --> 02:36:28,111
Thank you. I did and I know it.

973
02:36:28,112 --> 02:36:31,112
Do you know where? Captain Sawyer insisted that this information be kept strictly secret.

974
02:36:32,113 --> 02:36:34,113
So how do I get it out there?

975
02:36:36,114 --> 02:36:38,114
What tolomac are!

976
02:36:39,115 --> 02:36:41,115
I'll bring Captain Sawyer file.

977
02:37:03,116 --> 02:37:05,116
Good luck. Thank you.

978
02:37:12,117 --> 02:37:14,117
Come in, please.

979
02:37:23,118 --> 02:37:25,118
She is my daughter. Hi.

980
02:37:53,119 --> 02:37:55,119
Englez?
Da, Jack Rawles.

981
02:37:57,120 --> 02:37:59,120
Where are you from? Colditz.

982
02:38:02,121 --> 02:38:04,121
He is McNall. I am pleased.

983
02:38:06,122 --> 02:38:08,122
And Holster. Do not wake up.

984
02:38:08,123 --> 02:38:10,123
Sit down.

985
02:38:10,124 --> 02:38:12,124
Thank you.

986
02:38:17,125 --> 02:38:20,125
Since you are here? Six weeks.

987
02:38:38,126 --> 02:38:40,126
Lizy!

988
02:38:42,127 --> 02:38:44,127
I'm glad you came.

989
02:38:46,128 --> 02:38:48,128
Little angel.

990
02:38:49,129 --> 02:38:51,129
Is everything okay?

991
02:38:52,130 --> 02:38:54,130
Can we talk?

992
02:38:59,131 --> 02:39:01,131
Lizy

993
02:39:01,132 --> 02:39:03,132
Will you marry me?

994
02:39:07,133 --> 02:39:10,133
Do not you think we should do an honest woman out of you?

995
02:39:16,134 --> 02:39:18,134
Gives.

996
02:39:33,135 --> 02:39:35,135
Let's get out of here. Stupid in this country.

997
02:39:36,136 --> 02:39:38,136
Let's start from scratch. To go to America.

998
02:39:39,137 --> 02:39:41,137
Take it slowly.

999
02:39:42,138 --> 02:39:44,138
Away from all this nonsense.

1000
02:39:51,139 --> 02:39:53,139
I want to be where you are.

1001
02:40:41,140 --> 02:40:43,140
What was that?

1002
02:40:44,141 --> 02:40:46,141
Germans who come to check their homes. It happens.

1003
02:40:50,142 --> 02:40:52,142
Do not move.

1004
02:42:26,143 --> 02:42:28,143
Damn.

1005
02:42:28,144 --> 02:42:30,144
Killed? It looks like it, sir.

1006
02:42:32,145 --> 02:42:34,145
Oh my God. Poor boy.

1007
02:42:34,146 --> 02:42:35,146
You wanted to see me, sir? Yes.

1008
02:42:36,147 --> 02:42:38,147
They found Sawyer. It seems he was murdered.

1009
02:42:38,148 --> 02:42:40,148
Jesus, why would anyone want to kill Sawyer?

1010
02:42:41,149 --> 02:42:43,149
Only God knows.

1011
02:42:43,150 --> 02:42:45,150
Sir. News about shelter in Warsaw.

1012
02:42:50,151 --> 02:42:52,151
I've lost them.

1013
02:43:01,152 --> 02:43:03,152
God knows how it expic them.

1014
02:43:03,153 --> 02:43:04,153
Do you think they were betrayed? Someone gave expose.

1015
02:43:06,154 --> 02:43:09,154
Sir, you just do not think that would be related to Sawyer?

1016
02:43:10,155 --> 02:43:13,155
What? He handles this route. I thought...

1017
02:43:13,156 --> 02:43:15,156
Why would Sawyer as Rawles wanted to die?

1018
02:43:15,157 --> 02:43:16,157
Who said anything Rawles.

1019
02:43:16,158 --> 02:43:18,158
Well, with any of them.

1020
02:43:18,159 --> 02:43:21,159
Wait. Sawyer was in Colditz, right?

1021
02:43:23,160 --> 02:43:26,160
See what you can find. It must have been a link between them.

1022
02:43:29,161 --> 02:43:31,161
You take escape plan that night. And?

1023
02:43:34,162 --> 02:43:36,162
I was wondering if you found something new.

1024
02:43:36,163 --> 02:43:38,163
Nothing. I had reported.

1025
02:43:54,164 --> 02:43:56,164
Come on man!

1026
02:44:00,165 --> 02:44:02,165
What the hell are you wearing?

1027
02:44:06,166 --> 02:44:08,166
Are you all right, sir? I'm fine, thanks.

1028
02:44:15,167 --> 02:44:17,167
It's not too late to change your mind.

1029
02:44:18,168 --> 02:44:20,168
Maybe another time.

1030
02:44:23,169 --> 02:44:25,169
Thank you.

1031
02:45:47,170 --> 02:45:49,170
Came.

1032
02:45:52,171 --> 02:45:54,171
Tom.

1033
02:45:56,172 --> 02:45:58,172
I admire your will.

1034
02:46:40,173 --> 02:46:42,173
I can not.

1035
02:46:43,174 --> 02:46:45,174
Jack.

1036
02:47:08,175 --> 02:47:10,175
They are the best news for weeks.

1037
02:47:10,176 --> 02:47:14,176
McGrade, merry man. Someone managed to escape from that mess in Warsaw.

1038
02:47:16,177 --> 02:47:18,177
Jack Rawles. Did he tell anyone?

1039
02:47:18,178 --> 02:47:19,178
I guessed.

1040
02:47:22,179 --> 02:47:24,179
When he returned? It should arrive momentarily.

1041
02:47:25,180 --> 02:47:27,180
He met someone in Stockholm and have it sent by plane Red Cross.

1042
02:47:29,181 --> 02:47:31,181
McGrade.

1043
02:47:47,182 --> 02:47:49,182
I'm afraid Colonel Fullham wants to talk to you first.

1044
02:47:49,183 --> 02:47:51,183
Then you can do whatever you want.

1045
02:48:23,184 --> 02:48:25,184
Sir. You should see it.

1046
02:48:30,185 --> 02:48:32,185
McGrade. Oh my God!

1047
02:48:42,186 --> 02:48:44,186
By MI9. We have two officers.

1048
02:49:04,187 --> 02:49:06,187
Lieutenant!

1049
02:49:13,188 --> 02:49:15,188
Nick. Get your things!

1050
02:49:16,189 --> 02:49:18,189
What happens? Leave. Go?

1051
02:49:18,190 --> 02:49:20,190
Yes, I'm out of here. Just as I spoke.

1052
02:49:22,191 --> 02:49:24,191
Did something happen? No nothing.

1053
02:49:25,192 --> 02:49:27,192
But we can not leave now.

1054
02:49:28,193 --> 02:49:30,193
Must.

1055
02:49:31,194 --> 02:49:34,194
Something happened, huh? No nothing happened. I do not mind!

1056
02:49:36,195 --> 02:49:38,195
You must come with me, Lizy!

1057
02:49:39,196 --> 02:49:41,196
If you love me.

1058
02:49:43,197 --> 02:49:45,197
If you did something you must tell me!

1059
02:49:47,198 --> 02:49:50,198
I only want you. This is all that matters. Everything is nothing without you.

1060
02:49:54,199 --> 02:49:56,199
Remember the night bombing?

1061
02:49:57,200 --> 02:49:59,200
We can be what we can be what we want.

1062
02:50:01,201 --> 02:50:03,201
Just you and me.

1063
02:50:04,202 --> 02:50:06,202
We do not need anyone else.

1064
02:50:07,203 --> 02:50:09,203
Now pack your luggage.

1065
02:50:10,204 --> 02:50:13,204
Do this for me. Please! For us.

1066
02:50:14,205 --> 02:50:17,205
Trust me. I love you.

1067
02:50:22,206 --> 02:50:25,206
Trust me. Go. You're crazy.

1068
02:50:54,207 --> 02:50:56,207
You're too late, Jack! Where is it?

1069
02:50:56,208 --> 02:50:59,208
He left. We both lost. Lie!

1070
02:51:02,209 --> 02:51:04,209
Know. It's a hard habit bad.

1071
02:51:06,210 --> 02:51:08,210
I will kill you! I doubt.

1072
02:51:08,211 --> 02:51:09,211
Nick.

1073
02:51:10,212 --> 02:51:12,212
Do not make a sound! Who are you talking to?

1074
02:51:12,213 --> 02:51:14,213
Get out!

1075
02:51:19,214 --> 02:51:21,214
I do not want to kill you, Jack. But I do, believe me.

1076
02:51:23,215 --> 02:51:26,215
Nothing. Because I'll be back again.

1077
02:51:29,216 --> 02:51:31,216
Not this time.

1078
02:51:32,217 --> 02:51:34,217
What would make Lizy if I kill them? Whatever I want it.

1079
02:51:35,218 --> 02:51:38,218
Me love me, Jack. It's mine. You're too late.

1080
02:51:41,219 --> 02:51:43,219
Nick, I left my coat ...

1081
02:51:49,620 --> 02:51:51,620
Jack!

1082
02:51:52,621 --> 02:51:54,621
Get your bag!

1083
02:51:56,622 --> 02:51:58,622
Jack, are you yourself?

1084
02:52:00,623 --> 02:52:02,623
I turned to you, Lizy.

1085
02:52:03,624 --> 02:52:05,624
Lizy, Come on!

1086
02:52:06,625 --> 02:52:09,625
What are you doing? She told they are dead, Lizy.

1087
02:52:10,626 --> 02:52:13,626
And then he gave a house full of innocent people in the hands of the Nazis.

1088
02:52:17,627 --> 02:52:19,627
He lied and killed. Shut up! Nick!

1089
02:52:21,628 --> 02:52:23,628
Talking nonsense, Lizy. Get your luggage.

1090
02:52:24,629 --> 02:52:26,629
It's nothing. It's garbage.

1091
02:52:32,630 --> 02:52:34,630
Stop!

1092
02:52:39,631 --> 02:52:42,631
It is mine. Not!

1093
02:53:12,632 --> 02:53:15,632
Hands up! Drop the gun, McGrade!

1094
02:53:43,633 --> 02:53:45,633
I love you!

1095
02:54:08,634 --> 02:54:10,634
Motherfucker!

1096
02:54:51,635 --> 02:54:53,635
They did it! Passed.

1097
02:55:03,636 --> 02:55:06,636
Americans crossed the border. Soon to finish everything.

1098
02:55:14,637 --> 02:55:16,637
It's not good.

1099
02:55:26,638 --> 02:55:28,638
Hi, Peter!

1100
02:56:23,639 --> 02:56:26,639
Stay! Stop!

1101
02:57:18,640 --> 02:57:20,640
Fritz Werner. Number 324 576.

1102
02:57:24,641 --> 02:57:27,641
From this moment is your prisoner.

1103
02:58:03,642 --> 02:58:06,642
Lizy and came.

1104
02:58:07,643 --> 02:58:09,643
All week it was here.

1105
02:58:10,644 --> 02:58:12,644
What is with all the flowers?

1106
02:58:32,645 --> 02:58:34,645
Hi. Hi.

1107
02:58:38,646 --> 02:58:40,646
All repeat this for weeks. But I do not know where to start.

1108
02:58:41,647 --> 02:58:44,647
Jack! No no. I have to say a few things.

1109
02:58:45,648 --> 02:58:49,648
We ... We were both young when they started all this.

1110
02:58:54,649 --> 02:58:56,649
I still can not say I'm a grown man.

1111
02:58:57,650 --> 02:58:59,650
Yes you are.

1112
02:59:02,651 --> 02:59:04,651
Let's sit down a little.

1113
02:59:09,652 --> 02:59:11,652
We both had to do some things.

1114
02:59:11,653 --> 02:59:13,653
There were no rules.

1115
02:59:15,654 --> 02:59:17,654
Now we must try to live again.

1116
02:59:21,655 --> 02:59:23,655
What we had two was a dream.

1117
02:59:23,656 --> 02:59:26,656
Know. I know all about dreams.

1118
02:59:29,657 --> 02:59:31,657
My dream was a picture of you.

1119
02:59:33,658 --> 02:59:36,658
And not for you. That's you now.

1120
02:59:36,659 --> 02:59:39,659
And after everything that happened ...

1121
02:59:42,660 --> 02:59:44,660
I still love you.

1122
02:59:48,661 --> 02:59:50,661
I thought I will not see you again.

1123
02:59:51,662 --> 02:59:53,662
Know.

1124
02:59:54,663 --> 02:59:56,663
I understand.

1125
03:00:01,664 --> 03:00:03,664
Umpteenth love I have in me I can give someone.

1126
03:00:10,665 --> 03:00:12,665
I do not care how long it takes.

1127
03:00:20,666 --> 03:00:23,666
Better go. Of course.

1128
03:00:30,667 --> 03:00:33,667
However, I think I'd like to bring me flowers.

1129
03:00:34,668 --> 03:00:36,668
What about tomorrow?
