<i>handed over to us.</i>

<i>No, we will not be

<i>The Star Wheel in the Flower

<i>Understand?</i>

37
00:10:14,127 --> 00:10:19,814
<i>Oh, what will become of our
beautiful Bellflower?</i>

38
00:10:19,824 --> 00:10:23,378
<i>From M. Pathé & Co.</i>

39
00:10:27,999 --> 00:10:30,118
You know this 'M. Pathé & Co.'?

40
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:35,950
So what should I do?

41
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,865
You want the riddle solved?

42
00:10:43,335 --> 00:10:45,250
And Bellflower found?

43
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,200
You're joking!

44

What's the pay?

45
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:23,940
One million yen!!!

46
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:29,152
That's the ransom!

47
00:12:53,348 --> 00:12:55,860
The rest when we've solved
the case.

48
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:31,249
Where the General Tower is seen...

What's that?

68
00:22:20,374 --> 00:22:22,824
Something's turning...

69
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,446
It's the Flower House.

70
00:22:27,745 --> 00:22:29,663
The amusement park?

71
00:22:31,304 --> 00:22:33,774
Flower House... Flower?

72
00:22:35,874 --> 00:22:38,247
Where the General Tower
is seen...

73
00:22:38,971 --> 00:22:39,980
In the Flower...?

74
00:22:45,953 --> 00:22:48,194
Bellflower can't be here.

75

<i>FLOWER HOUSE</i>

76
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:18,986
If this is the Flower,

00:23:54,512 --> 00:23:56,500
Have you found her?

78
00:24:02,998 --> 00:24:05,193
Don't you hear her?

<i>Well done!</i>

<i>Did you enjoy solving

82
00:25:03,412 --> 00:25:08,384
<i>But Bellflower is not here.</i>

83
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:16,925
<i>She's with us, having a good time,

84
00:25:17,527 --> 00:25:19,077

<i>Our M. Pathé & Co. has...</i>

86

<i>since yesterday, grown more

87
00:25:29,849 --> 00:25:35,791
<i>wishes to ask you for
a higher ransom.</i>

88
00:25:35,827 --> 00:25:43,340
<i>Please be good enough to add

89
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:47,335
<i>another million yen,</i>

90
00:25:47,372 --> 00:25:52,669
<i>and have it brought to us.</i>

91
00:25:53,428 --> 00:26:00,191
<i>Our gyroscope will

92
00:26:00,228 --> 00:26:05,011
<i>The time limit will be
up tomorrow.</i>

93
00:26:05,047 --> 00:26:10,815
<i>Our gyroscope spins

<i>The place to seek...

95
00:26:39,548 --> 00:26:41,980
Not going to get any sleep?

96
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:04,302
You want us to go on?

97
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:29,796
Bellflower's really safe?

98
00:28:34,566 --> 00:28:36,654
At least till tonight.

99
00:28:45,697 --> 00:28:47,693
What will we do?

100
00:28:52,836 --> 00:28:55,431
Let's ask the gyroscope.

101
00:29:17,605 --> 00:29:20,863
<i>The Top Shop</i>

102
00:29:53,132 --> 00:29:55,523
Oh, a spinning top.

103
00:30:00,469 --> 00:30:03,789
You find these at fairs.

104
00:30:19,515 --> 00:30:22,806
There's a fair at
Moon-Island Shrine.

105
00:30:25,378 --> 00:30:28,743
<i>Top Shop</i>

106
00:31:29,366 --> 00:31:30,566
M. Pathé & Co.!

107
00:31:47,145 --> 00:31:49,266
What are they up to?

108
00:31:49,281 --> 00:31:55,242
<i>M. Pathé & Co. -
Professor Jarowski
from the British Empire</i>

109
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:53,687
So this is called asking
the gyroscope!

110
00:33:01,277 --> 00:33:03,283
What's wrong?

111
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:07,193
It's too obvious.

112
00:33:09,247 --> 00:33:11,383
Could it be a trap?

113
00:33:32,203 --> 00:33:34,347
You follow those two.

114
00:33:35,877 --> 00:33:37,899
I'll follow the box.

115
00:33:42,434 --> 00:33:45,580
We'll meet back here.

116
00:36:16,742 --> 00:36:19,804
How do you like our
Pathé gyroscopes?

117
00:36:23,505 --> 00:36:24,543
Uotsuka!

118
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,455
You from Pathé?

119
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:17,970
<i>We have duly received
the two million yen.</i>

120
00:40:19,403 --> 00:40:22,408
<i>As we told you,</i>

121
00:40:22,444 --> 00:40:26,822
<i>the gyroscope showed
you where to go.</i>

122
00:40:28,207 --> 00:40:32,607
<i>Sorry to have
been rough, but...</i>

123
00:40:32,608 --> 00:40:37,805
<i>it was the easiest way
to bring you here.</i>

124
00:40:38,618 --> 00:40:40,734
<i>Forgive us.</i>

125
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,920
Hand over Bellflower.

126
00:40:41,831 --> 00:40:45,650
<i>We regret we cannot.</i>

127
00:40:45,655 --> 00:40:47,440
You mean she's...?!

128
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:53,527
<i>Don't worry.
She's in good health.</i>

129
00:40:56,157 --> 00:40:58,037
That song proves nothing!

130
00:41:00,496 --> 00:41:04,464
<i>Don't move. You're not
going any place.</i>

131
00:41:04,501 --> 00:41:08,203
<i>We're taking Bellflower
to the next place.</i>

132
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:12,110
<i>If you want her back,
Mr. Uotsuka,</i>

133
00:41:12,147 --> 00:41:18,975
<i>your eagerness and another
one million yen will be necessary.</i>

134
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:22,615
<i>Go to the next place.</i>

135
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:25,011
<i>It is...</i>

136
00:41:25,048 --> 00:41:27,289
No, this is the end!

137
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:46,894
Please hurry - solve the
riddle and save me!

138
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:56,874
I've been here for 50 years
of cherry-blossoms.

139
00:43:01,628 --> 00:43:04,577
Soon, I will be asleep.

140
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:13,943
Please find me quickly.

141
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:17,002
Save me from this
endless story.

142
00:45:25,826 --> 00:45:28,866
<i>Electric House</i>

143
00:45:45,502 --> 00:45:46,531
Found her?

144
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:50,784
M. Pathé & Co...?

145
00:45:55,146 --> 00:45:56,258
And the two million yen...?

146
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:05,271
They took the money
<i>and</i> Bellflower.

147
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:07,667
Both?

148
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:16,444
'Electric House'?

149
00:46:22,585 --> 00:46:24,681
Bellflower wrote this.

150
00:46:26,262 --> 00:46:27,777
So you met her?

151
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:48,225
Yet another mystery word.
I've had enough!

152
00:47:23,245 --> 00:47:27,294
It's time to give this to him.

153
00:47:34,822 --> 00:47:36,679
You want me to go on?

154
00:47:45,491 --> 00:47:47,490
They're not after the money.

155
00:48:13,817 --> 00:48:16,848
Use this if they're not
after the money.

156
00:48:26,066 --> 00:48:28,262
You know this place?

157
00:48:43,069 --> 00:48:46,016
The Electric House?

158
00:48:50,717 --> 00:48:55,273
There used to be a theatre
called that in Asakusa.

159
00:49:01,602 --> 00:49:03,558
It must be that.
Asakusa?

160
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:18,493
Bellflower and the money
will be saved...

161
00:49:18,509 --> 00:49:23,038
if this whole thing isn't
all just a dream.

162
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:58,531
The old lady at the comb shop
seems to know everything.

163
00:50:01,330 --> 00:50:02,666
Everything?

164
00:50:10,831 --> 00:50:14,490
It used to be where
they showed movies.

165
00:50:23,239 --> 00:50:26,725
All old-time matinee-idols.

166
