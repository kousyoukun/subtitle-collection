1
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,793
Everyone get outta the water.

2
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:44,196
Come on.

3
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:46,598
Get close to your ma.

4
00:02:50,938 --> 00:02:53,539
Get close.

5
00:02:56,443 --> 00:02:57,643
Come on.

6
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:03,715
One,

7
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:06,318
two,

8
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,520
three.

9
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:16,895
All right.

10
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:35,000
Forward, hup.

11
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:40,672
Forward, hup.

12
00:05:43,077 --> 00:05:44,743
Forward.

13
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:47,112
Hup.

14
00:05:47,114 --> 00:05:48,814
Forward, hup.

15
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:53,518
Forward, hup.

16
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:04,129
Forward, hup.

17
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:14,973
Giddy up.

18
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:40,892
I'm scrubbing dada.

19
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:48,099
Okay, come here.

20
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:06,651
Mama was soaking.

21
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,193
Can you pass the salt?

22
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:57,836
Pass your sister the salt.

23
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:15,220
Don't feed the dog.

24
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:20,091
Keep doing that,
I'll give it away.

25
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,999
Eat your food.

26
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,268
Seventeen, eighteen,

27
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,303
nineteen, twenty.

28
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,041
Here I come.

29
00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:47,145
Found you!

30
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:03,294
Mama.

31
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:07,432
What's a S-P-I-G...

32
00:16:20,747 --> 00:16:22,981
Do insects go to heaven?

33
00:16:24,718 --> 00:16:25,718
No.

34
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:28,353
Only people go to heaven.

35
00:16:28,355 --> 00:16:30,755
Good people.

36
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:36,561
No one ever knows how bad...

37
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:43,034
If you're in the middle
of a doubtful day...

38
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:48,553
It's okay, it's okay.

39
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:18,709
Come down, come on.

40
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:20,611
I wanna see!

41
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:26,544
Michael.

42
00:22:43,763 --> 00:22:46,364
You know how it's been.

43
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:53,938
Ain't no food
out there for them.

44
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,540
Ain't no rain either.

45
00:23:02,682 --> 00:23:05,082
Can't do it.

46
00:23:11,657 --> 00:23:14,625
I'd like to help you out.

47
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:15,860
You know I would.

48
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,701
We've gotta do something
about that bill of yours

49
00:23:23,703 --> 00:23:25,603
for the past couple months.

50
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:31,175
Well.

51
00:23:35,948 --> 00:23:38,582
Been just as tough around here.

52
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:18,048
He has it!

53
00:30:22,087 --> 00:30:23,387
Move.

54
00:30:49,582 --> 00:30:50,582
It's not it.

55
00:30:50,583 --> 00:30:51,882
No.

56
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:52,550
Try moving.

57
00:30:52,551 --> 00:30:54,484
Move over a little bit.

58
00:30:54,486 --> 00:30:55,853
Wait.

59
00:30:55,855 --> 00:30:58,188
Get back, like, this way.

60
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,190
Go back.

61
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:00,290
Yes, right there.

62
00:33:32,077 --> 00:33:34,077
No, I feel it.

63
00:35:51,283 --> 00:35:55,619
If you could take only one,
who would you save?

64
00:35:55,621 --> 00:35:58,288
Dad or Mom?

65
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:01,558
Mom.

66
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,693
Mom has AIDS.

67
00:36:03,695 --> 00:36:06,329
You have AIDS, too?

68
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:07,531
No.

69
00:36:09,434 --> 00:36:11,601
I dunno... maybe.

70
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:16,606
She's gonna die.

71
00:36:16,608 --> 00:36:17,674
When?

72
00:36:18,911 --> 00:36:20,377
Soon.

73
00:36:22,181 --> 00:36:24,214
That's what happens
to people with AIDS.

74
00:38:46,925 --> 00:38:48,591
Jacob, come on!

75
00:40:30,896 --> 00:40:31,961
Come on.

76
00:40:33,865 --> 00:40:35,165
Let's go.

77
00:40:35,167 --> 00:40:38,535
Why are you walking
so slowly, buddy?

78
00:40:52,751 --> 00:40:54,818
And then he landed
on the trampoline,

79
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:58,021
jumped over the moon,
and landed in a China shoe,

80
00:40:58,023 --> 00:41:00,824
then went back home
to see his friends,

81
00:41:00,826 --> 00:41:04,093
June Bug Head and Hairy Head.

82
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:28,651
...jumped over the moon,
and landed in a China shoe.

83
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:31,955
And then he went back home...

84
00:41:31,957 --> 00:41:33,523
To see his friends.

85
00:41:33,525 --> 00:41:36,893
To see his friends...
what were their names?

86
00:41:36,895 --> 00:41:40,230
- June Bug Head and Hairy Head.
- June Bug Head and Hairy Head?

87
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:44,033
Are you serious?

88
00:42:53,138 --> 00:42:56,839
"I give you Navar the Great,
the last of a renowned family

89
00:42:56,841 --> 00:42:58,708
of fire eaters whose history
goes back

90
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:00,143
way back to Napoleon's days.

91
00:43:00,145 --> 00:43:02,178
That preliminary there
was just, shall I say,

92
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:04,614
a warm up, because I want you
to be prepared

93
00:43:04,616 --> 00:43:06,983
to be amazed now
with what Navar will do.

94
00:43:06,985 --> 00:43:10,853
First, he will consume
five cigarettes."

95
00:43:10,855 --> 00:43:12,055
Wait, Dad, no, please.

96
00:43:12,057 --> 00:43:13,690
Just a little bit longer.

97
00:43:13,692 --> 00:43:17,026
Bed, now.

98
00:43:17,028 --> 00:43:18,127
Come on.

99
00:43:21,266 --> 00:43:22,365
Goodnight, Dad.

100
00:43:22,367 --> 00:43:24,300
Goodnight.

101
00:46:43,101 --> 00:46:47,236
Where do you think
you're going like that?

102
00:46:47,238 --> 00:46:50,173
We're not leaving until
you wash that off your face.

103
00:47:13,565 --> 00:47:15,164
Still don't see it.

104
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:09,619
"Do you know how sweetly
he once said to him..."

105
00:52:20,872 --> 00:52:22,404
What's going on?

106
00:52:24,575 --> 00:52:25,841
What happened?

107
00:52:28,613 --> 00:52:29,812
Dad, no.

108
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:34,817
Let's go.

109
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,586
Where are you taking him?

110
00:52:39,857 --> 00:52:41,924
- Get up.
- He didn't do anything.

111
00:52:46,197 --> 00:52:47,530
Get in the car.

112
00:53:30,441 --> 00:53:31,473
Come on.

113
00:59:42,179 --> 00:59:44,746
When are you gonna
stop doing that?

114
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:45,715
Instead of doing that,
should be doing

115
00:59:45,716 --> 00:59:47,349
what you're supposed to.

116
01:00:45,175 --> 01:00:46,375
Fill her up.

117
01:01:45,135 --> 01:01:46,435
Fifty five.

118
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:15,397
One, perform it on a hill.

119
01:02:17,801 --> 01:02:20,435
Two, make sure you have
a lot of room,

120
01:02:20,437 --> 01:02:22,337
so you don't run into anything.

121
01:02:25,042 --> 01:02:29,010
Three, spin around
in clockwise circles.

122
01:02:32,149 --> 01:02:36,785
Four, yell it while spinning
around in circles.

123
01:02:36,787 --> 01:02:39,321
It should be rhythmical
and fast.

124
01:02:41,191 --> 01:02:45,794
Five, if you're trying
to get rid of rain,

125
01:02:45,796 --> 01:02:49,965
spin in counterclockwise circles
and say your chant backwards.

126
01:02:54,004 --> 01:02:57,372
It works more effectively
in an open field,

127
01:02:57,374 --> 01:02:58,907
and it won't work straight away.

128
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:05,213
"From waters of the heavens,
to waters of the sea,

129
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:10,318
bring my will upon me, I cast
this spell so mote it be.

130
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:13,021
From waters of the heavens,
to waters of the sea,

131
01:03:13,023 --> 01:03:17,025
bring my will upon me, I cast
this spell so mote it be."

132
01:03:17,027 --> 01:03:18,393
Rain!

133
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:39,307
Dad.

134
01:04:39,309 --> 01:04:40,408
Yeah?

135
01:04:44,314 --> 01:04:46,648
Here, let me see that.

136
01:04:55,459 --> 01:04:57,292
This is supposed to help.

137
01:05:06,203 --> 01:05:07,569
Is it better now?

138
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:12,641
Yeah, much better.

139
01:07:00,784 --> 01:07:02,784
Mom.

140
01:07:05,389 --> 01:07:06,488
Mom.

141
01:07:09,192 --> 01:07:10,291
Mom.

142
01:07:19,569 --> 01:07:21,770
Stop it, Dad, stop!

143
01:07:55,238 --> 01:07:58,106
Mom, Mom!

144
01:07:59,609 --> 01:08:01,543
What did you do?

145
01:08:43,553 --> 01:08:46,888

01:11:35,925 --> 01:11:40,828
♫ I was just
sittin' here thinkin' ♫

171
01:11:40,830 --> 01:11:45,633
♫ Of your kiss
and your warm embrace, yeah ♫

172
01:11:49,773 --> 01:11:52,040
♫ When the reflection
in the glass

173
01:11:52,042 --> 01:11:56,311
that I held
to my lips now, baby ♫

174
01:11:56,313 --> 01:11:58,780
♫ Yeah yeah ♫

175
01:11:58,782 --> 01:12:03,651
♫ Revealed the tears
that was on my face, yeah ♫

176
01:12:06,723 --> 01:12:09,857
♫ Baby, baby,
I'd rather ♫

177
01:12:09,859 --> 01:12:12,794
♫ I'd rather be blind, boy ♫

178
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:20,668
♫ Than to see you walk
away from me, child ♫

179
01:12:25,608 --> 01:12:28,876
♫ So you see
I love you so much ♫

180
01:12:28,878 --> 01:12:31,713
♫ That I don't want
to watch you leave me, baby ♫

181
01:12:34,384 --> 01:12:36,484
♫ Most of all,
I just don't ♫

182
01:12:36,486 --> 01:12:39,554
♫ I just don't want
to be free, no ♫

183
01:12:43,093 --> 01:12:46,961
♫ I was just,
I was just ♫

184
01:12:46,963 --> 01:12:50,465
♫ I was just
sittin' here thinkin' ♫

185
01:12:52,102 --> 01:12:55,837
♫ Of your kiss
and your warm embrace ♫

186
01:14:23,893 --> 01:14:25,560
Look at me.

187
01:14:40,844 --> 01:14:42,477
You're my wife.

188
01:14:48,485 --> 01:14:49,917
You're my wife.

189
01:14:55,825 --> 01:14:57,758
You're my wife.

190
01:17:46,162 --> 01:17:47,928
Wanna see something?

191
01:17:55,672 --> 01:17:58,005
Do you wanna touch it?

192
01:17:58,007 --> 01:17:59,707
It doesn't hurt, look.

193
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:06,280
Dad says it won't
even leave a scar.

194
01:18:06,282 --> 01:18:07,748
Look at mine.

195
01:18:09,419 --> 01:18:10,451
What happened?

196
01:18:16,092 --> 01:18:17,925
I was just chasing a cat and,

197
01:18:17,927 --> 01:18:19,827
just as I was
about to capture it,

198
01:18:19,829 --> 01:18:22,263
fell on a bunch
of broken bottles.

199
01:18:27,070 --> 01:18:29,870
I was a cat in a past life.

200
01:18:31,974 --> 01:18:33,374
So I've got a couple lives left.

201
01:22:27,043 --> 01:22:28,642
I don't wanna go.

202
01:22:28,644 --> 01:22:32,112
You're coming with us,
end of story.

203
01:25:40,569 --> 01:25:42,136
Let me see it.

204
01:25:42,138 --> 01:25:43,904
Put it away.

205
01:25:48,577 --> 01:25:49,843
Don't do that.

206
01:25:53,415 --> 01:25:55,849
Put it away right now.

207
01:25:58,254 --> 01:25:59,520
Now!

208
01:26:03,559 --> 01:26:06,894
♫ When I head on out ♫

209
01:26:06,896 --> 01:26:08,729
♫ For an evening ♫

210
01:26:11,233 --> 01:26:16,403
♫ To stretch out
my wings and soar ♫

211
01:30:53,081 --> 01:30:55,615
Dad, I gotta pee.

212
01:39:05,081 --> 01:39:06,515
The End

213
01:39:07,115 --> 01:39:11,115
