165
00:09:14,063 --> 00:09:18,032
I can't bear to think of these
kids without a team.

166
00:09:19,535 --> 00:09:23,437
If we don't win at Nationals.
we lose our sponsor.

167
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:25,072
Emu Milk.

168
00:09:25,074 --> 00:09:27,808
And the camp will close.

169
00:09:28,911 --> 00:09:30,544
Oh. want some help?

170
00:09:31,381 --> 00:09:32,646
Oh. thank you.

171
00:09:33,483 --> 00:09:35,916
Oh. Good morning. No running.

172
00:09:38,154 --> 00:09:40,121
Are these the coaches'
quarters?

173
00:09:40,957 --> 00:09:44,725
There was a tiny...
massive leak.

174
00:09:44,727 --> 00:09:47,661
So you're in the girls' dorm
now. Whoo-hoo!

175
00:09:47,663 --> 00:09:49,697
Party. Pillow fights.

176
00:09:49,699 --> 00:09:52,066
There's your bed and...

177
00:09:52,068 --> 00:09:54,402
there's your desk and...

178
00:09:55,805 --> 00:09:57,405
[sighs]

179
00:09:58,107 --> 00:09:59,907
-Uh...

180
00:09:59,909 --> 00:10:01,609
I was promised my own room.

181
00:10:01,611 --> 00:10:04,445
The sky promises rain...

182
00:10:04,447 --> 00:10:05,880
yet there are deserts.

183
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,483
This is the only available bed.

184
00:10:09,485 --> 00:10:11,118
OK. I guess I'll make it work.

185
00:10:13,956 --> 00:10:16,457
-Mikayla Michaels?
-Claire Carpenter?

186
00:10:16,459 --> 00:10:18,526
I cannot live with her.

187
00:10:18,527 --> 00:10:20,594
I have a rigorous training
schedule and this disruption...

188
00:10:20,596 --> 00:10:21,896
What is she even doing here?

189
00:10:21,898 --> 00:10:23,030
I'm coaching.

190
00:10:23,032 --> 00:10:24,632
Coaching what? Your ego?

191
00:10:24,634 --> 00:10:26,867
Coaching future champions.
something you'll never be.

192
00:10:26,869 --> 00:10:28,736
I championed all over you
last time.

193
00:10:28,738 --> 00:10:31,105
-Oh come on.
-Whoa. whoa. whoa.

194
00:10:31,107 --> 00:10:32,773
Feel the energy.

195
00:10:34,644 --> 00:10:37,945
Visualise a friendship
blossoming between you.

196
00:10:37,947 --> 00:10:40,514
If you can imagine it...

197
00:10:40,516 --> 00:10:41,982
you can will it into reality.

198
00:10:41,984 --> 00:10:43,217
What?

199
00:10:43,219 --> 00:10:45,186
That doesn't make any sense.

200
00:10:45,188 --> 00:10:46,720
Or does it?

201
00:10:55,231 --> 00:10:56,730
[both groan]

202
00:11:06,609 --> 00:11:09,009
You have an extra centimetre?

203
00:11:09,011 --> 00:11:10,478
[scoffs]

204
00:11:14,517 --> 00:11:16,917
-Happy?
-Not really.

205
00:11:21,891 --> 00:11:24,525
-Hey!
-What now?

206
00:11:25,661 --> 00:11:27,061
We'll need to agree
on some rules.

207
00:11:32,835 --> 00:11:34,268
They'll have to do for now.

208
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,103
That counts as conversation.

209
00:11:36,105 --> 00:11:37,638
[laughs]

210
00:11:38,774 --> 00:11:40,140
[indistinct chatter]

211
00:11:40,142 --> 00:11:41,675
Thank you.

212
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,985
[indistinct chatter]

213
00:12:09,805 --> 00:12:11,539
[shrieks]

214
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:13,007
Oh. my god! Oh. my god!

215
00:12:16,746 --> 00:12:18,029
They told me you were here

216
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,313
but I thought they were
playing a joke on me.

217
00:12:19,315 --> 00:12:21,148
like when they told me
a tidal wave was coming here.

218
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,883
So I wore a life-vest
for a week.

219
00:12:22,885 --> 00:12:25,185
But you're not like that
tidal wave. you're real.

220
00:12:25,187 --> 00:12:26,687
Remember to breathe.

221
00:12:26,689 --> 00:12:28,055
I'm Annabelle Shumpert.

222
00:12:28,057 --> 00:12:29,757
Is that a name or a condition?

223
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:32,626
President of the Australia
Branch of the Claire Army.

224
00:12:33,329 --> 00:12:35,829
I'm a Claire Bear for life.

225
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:38,632
I am your biggest fan.

226
00:12:38,634 --> 00:12:40,801
Like. I know there's
that one fan in Belgium

227
00:12:40,803 --> 00:12:42,836
who says she's the biggest
but she's lying

228
00:12:42,838 --> 00:12:44,305
and I will fight her.

229
00:12:46,242 --> 00:12:48,042
It was nice to meet you.

230
00:12:48,044 --> 00:12:50,044
but I haven't eaten
since the plane. so...

231
00:12:50,046 --> 00:12:52,212
Follow me.

232
00:12:52,214 --> 00:12:54,748
Move! Claire Carpenter
coming through.

233
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,584
[soft quirky music]

234
00:13:07,964 --> 00:13:10,631
So. cafeteria's only open
at mealtimes

235
00:13:10,633 --> 00:13:12,700
but you can get snacks
whenever you want.

236
00:13:13,703 --> 00:13:16,971
Oh and don't forget. three
daily servings of Emu Milk.

237
00:13:18,874 --> 00:13:20,374
Your emus make milk?

238
00:13:20,376 --> 00:13:22,776
Not exactly.

239
00:13:22,778 --> 00:13:25,079
I wouldn't look into it
too deeply.

240
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:36,256
Maybe we should just focus on
eating

241
00:13:36,258 --> 00:13:38,058
and not talking.

242
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,628
Yeah. Yeah. We should.

243
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,229
Yeah.

244
00:13:42,231 --> 00:13:43,664
Yay.

245
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,633
So. where have you been
the last two months?

246
00:13:45,635 --> 00:13:47,001
Do you like Australia?

247
00:13:47,003 --> 00:13:48,452
Are you gonna swim for us?

248
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:49,902
Does that mean you have
dual citizenship?

249
00:13:49,905 --> 00:13:52,206
Do you have a secret
Australian sister? Is it me?

250
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:53,774
Could it be me?

251
00:13:53,776 --> 00:13:55,843
Can I be... Could it be?

252
00:13:55,845 --> 00:13:57,111
Amy. right?

253
00:13:57,113 --> 00:13:59,747
It's Annabelle. It's fine.

254
00:13:59,749 --> 00:14:01,199
Annabelle...

255
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,650
I'm just going to take this
to my room.

256
00:14:02,652 --> 00:14:04,184
Just... I'm so tired.

257
00:14:05,087 --> 00:14:07,688
Oh. yeah. Yeah.
makes sense. Yeah.

258
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:09,390
-Wanna high five?
-Sorry.

259
00:14:09,392 --> 00:14:11,058
Yep. it's fine.

260
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:12,725
[reporter]<i> We attempted to</i>
<i> interview her and...</i>

261
00:14:12,728 --> 00:14:14,912
<i> Well. see for yourself.</i>

262
00:14:14,913 --> 00:14:17,097
<i> It looked like you were afraid</i>
<i> of the water?</i> [shrieks]

263
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,800
[Claire] No cameras.

264
00:14:19,802 --> 00:14:22,236
[giggling]

265
00:14:24,073 --> 00:14:25,673
Coops?

266
00:14:25,675 --> 00:14:27,841
Cooper! Bro. you're
not even listening.

267
00:14:27,843 --> 00:14:29,410
I'm totally lost
on this new map.

268
00:14:29,412 --> 00:14:31,779
Not as lost as this girl
I met this morning.

269
00:14:31,781 --> 00:14:33,047
[video game pauses]

270
00:14:33,049 --> 00:14:34,281
A girl?

271
00:14:34,283 --> 00:14:36,984
Yeah. some American.

272
00:14:36,986 --> 00:14:39,053
And what's she doing here?

273
00:14:39,055 --> 00:14:41,255
Swimming with the girls' team.
I guess.

274
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:44,024
Is she cute?

275
00:14:45,394 --> 00:14:49,897
Ooh-la-la. Liam's in love!

276
00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:51,365
I can't afford
to get distracted.

277
00:14:51,367 --> 00:14:53,801
Maybe your parents
will lighten up.

278
00:14:53,803 --> 00:14:56,236
Oh. yeah. Not until
I'm Dr. Liam Henderson.

279
00:14:56,238 --> 00:14:59,239
Of course. bro. it won't matter
if the camp closes.

280
00:14:59,241 --> 00:15:04,311
[scoffs] If the camp closes.
I'm gonna be a full-time gamer.

281
00:15:04,313 --> 00:15:05,746
[video game restarts]

282
00:15:06,382 --> 00:15:08,082
-Is that right?
-Mm-hmm.

283
00:15:08,084 --> 00:15:10,918
-Well. until then...
-[groans]

284
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,820
...we got practice. Let's go.

285
00:15:17,226 --> 00:15:18,492
[chuckles]

286
00:15:18,494 --> 00:15:22,129
I'm sorry. but who steams
their swimsuit?

287
00:15:22,131 --> 00:15:24,231
Some of us like
to look our best.

288
00:15:25,101 --> 00:15:27,768
Well. it's just gonna get wet.

289
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:29,903
Yours managed to stay dry.

290
00:15:34,777 --> 00:15:38,112
Alright. well. try not to steal
anything while I'm gone.

291
00:15:42,885 --> 00:15:44,251
-Howdy!
-[gasps]

292
00:15:44,253 --> 00:15:46,754
They say that in America.
right?

293
00:15:46,756 --> 00:15:48,155
Anyway. I was thinking -

294
00:15:48,157 --> 00:15:50,958
so. an athlete of your stature
has so many obligations.

295
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,762
you know. like autographs and
endorsements and award shows.

296
00:15:54,764 --> 00:15:56,830
Where you going with this?

297
00:15:56,832 --> 00:16:01,869
Maybe. like.
I should be your. um...

298
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:04,538
...assistant?

299
00:16:05,775 --> 00:16:07,207
Maybe?

300
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:11,512
A little bit?

301
00:16:12,548 --> 00:16:14,815
Yeah. you know. I guess
I could use an intern.

302
00:16:14,817 --> 00:16:16,316
[gasps] OK.

303
00:16:16,318 --> 00:16:18,285
Alright. first order of
business...

304
00:16:18,287 --> 00:16:20,454
show me where the boys practice.

305
00:16:20,456 --> 00:16:22,122
[gong sounds]

306
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:25,292
Swimmers. gather round.

307
00:16:27,096 --> 00:16:28,896
Come in. come in.

308
00:16:30,266 --> 00:16:32,099
Namaste.

309
00:16:33,402 --> 00:16:38,539
As you know. Nationals are
less than four weeks away

310
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:44,144
and we've got to be
one with the water

311
00:16:44,146 --> 00:16:46,146
and centre ourselves mentally.

312
00:16:46,148 --> 00:16:47,815
[laughter]

313
00:16:47,817 --> 00:16:50,350
To help us with
the final mile.

314
00:16:50,352 --> 00:16:52,486
I've expanded our collective

315
00:16:52,488 --> 00:16:56,123
to include
another passionate coach.

316
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:57,257
Oh. here we go.

317
00:16:57,259 --> 00:17:00,711
And who better than another
swimmer

318
00:17:00,712 --> 00:17:04,164
who won two gold medals at the
last World Championships?

319
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:08,035
She's one of America's
top athletes.

320
00:17:08,037 --> 00:17:10,971
Give it up
for Claire Carpenter.

321
00:17:10,973 --> 00:17:12,573
[Annabelle] Whoo!

322
00:17:12,575 --> 00:17:13,907
[Bodhi] Whoo!

323
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:15,309
Hi.

324
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:19,146
Oh! Um... Catastrophe Claire!

325
00:17:19,148 --> 00:17:20,247
[scattered laughter]

326
00:17:20,249 --> 00:17:21,882
So... some of you
have heard of me.

327
00:17:21,884 --> 00:17:23,884

00:53:30,283 --> 00:53:33,618
When I came back.
they were gone.

978
00:53:36,156 --> 00:53:38,123
And so are my goggles.

979
00:53:39,726 --> 00:53:42,394
I swear I never took them.

980
00:53:43,397 --> 00:53:45,163
I remember that day.

981
00:53:46,466 --> 00:53:48,366
As soon as you went
in to shower.

982
00:53:48,368 --> 00:53:50,635

983
00:53:50,637 --> 00:53:52,504
Elsa Chang.

984
00:53:54,174 --> 00:53:56,141
No! Why didn't you tell me?

985
00:53:59,413 --> 00:54:01,179
Would you have listened?

986
00:54:03,483 --> 00:54:06,151
That really messed with me.

987
00:54:06,153 --> 00:54:08,686
After that. I lost the race
to Elsa and then...

988
00:54:09,623 --> 00:54:12,257
I went water skiing
to clear my head.

989
00:54:13,827 --> 00:54:16,628
I was awful to you
for no reason.

990
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:19,064
I haven't been much better.

991
00:54:20,534 --> 00:54:22,534
Can we start over?

992
00:54:23,837 --> 00:54:25,603
I'd like that.

were great

00:55:22,729 --> 00:55:24,462
but your dive was too deep.

How was practice today?

1013
00:56:12,779 --> 00:56:16,281
I'm still one-tenth
of a second behind.

1014
00:56:17,918 --> 00:56:21,786
It's never easy
right before a meet. is it?

1015
00:56:23,690 --> 00:56:25,823
I just... I get so tense.

1016
00:56:25,825 --> 00:56:28,826
And if one thing's out of
place. it just throws me off.

Oh. yeah. I feel that.

1018
00:56:31,364 --> 00:56:33,831
Once I ran out of low-volume
conditioner right before a meet

1019
00:56:33,833 --> 00:56:35,900
and I freaked out

1020
00:56:35,901 --> 00:56:37,968
because I was convinced it would
change the drag on my swim cap.

1021

No way!

for breakfast.

Yeah. maybe you should
try meditation.

Not that I'm suggesting
you go full Coach Bodhi. but...

1033

What did you even
say to Coach Bodhi?

1034
00:57:06,967 --> 00:57:09,767

01:02:45,338 --> 01:02:47,204
[both laugh]

1138
01:02:57,684 --> 01:02:59,116
Looking good.

1139
01:02:59,118 --> 01:03:00,651
They can be better. though.

1140
01:03:01,821 --> 01:03:03,721
Let me explain how I do it.

1141
01:03:05,224 --> 01:03:08,759
So. basically. it's a corkscrew
twist off the wall.

1142
01:03:11,064 --> 01:03:15,633
You flip less as you turn and
then twist as you streamline.

1143
01:03:16,869 --> 01:03:18,803
[soft uplifting music]

1144
01:03:23,910 --> 01:03:25,242
Yeah.
just twist a split-second later.

1145
01:03:25,244 --> 01:03:26,777
it'll be even better.

1146
01:03:30,149 --> 01:03:32,783

Manual number five.

1147
01:03:32,785 --> 01:03:34,885
Early bird gets the fish.

1148
01:03:34,887 --> 01:03:36,887
And...

1149
01:03:36,889 --> 01:03:39,357
So. do you think
I could join in?

1150
01:03:39,359 --> 01:03:41,158
Get over here.

1151
01:03:43,262 --> 01:03:45,096
Yeah. let's see those again.

1152
01:03:54,874 --> 01:03:56,374
Nice. Liam!

1153
01:03:56,376 --> 01:03:59,276
-That actually felt faster.
-Yeah. it looks faster.

1154
01:03:59,278 --> 01:04:01,078
Claire. thank you.

1155
01:04:03,182 --> 01:04:05,416

[moans]

1157
01:04:13,993 --> 01:04:17,895
How was your
insanely early practice?

1158
01:04:17,897 --> 01:04:19,897
-It was good.
-Yeah.

1159
01:04:19,899 --> 01:04:22,099
I'm starving. You ready?

1160
01:04:22,101 --> 01:04:24,735
Yeah. I'll... Hold on...

1161
01:04:25,371 --> 01:04:27,304
I'm still waking up.

1162
01:04:29,008 --> 01:04:31,842
She worked us pretty hard
today.

1163
01:04:31,844 --> 01:04:36,681
Ah... The things
we do for love.

1164
01:04:36,683 --> 01:04:38,849
Whoo. [laughs]

1165
01:04:39,886 --> 01:04:42,386
Oi. dude! [laughs]

1166
01:04:42,388 --> 01:04:45,289
-We're just friends.
-Yeah.

1167
01:04:45,291 --> 01:04:47,224
Follow your heart. bro.

1168
01:04:48,161 --> 01:04:51,696
Nah. Otherwise.
you're just wasting time.

1169

[both] 148...

1170
01:04:57,203 --> 01:05:01,238
149... 150.

1171
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:03,274
[both laugh]

1172
01:05:03,276 --> 01:05:06,944
Why are 150 push-ups
so much harder than 140?

1173
01:05:06,946 --> 01:05:08,846
Dawn practice was rough.

1174
01:05:08,848 --> 01:05:12,483
Morning was miserable and this
afternoon was excruciating.

1175
01:05:13,453 --> 01:05:16,287
Still on for early morning
practice tomorrow?

1176
01:05:16,289 --> 01:05:18,289
Oh. definitely.

1177
01:05:20,193 --> 01:05:24,161
So... how do you learn
to coach so well? Your dad?

1178
01:05:25,364 --> 01:05:27,064
Yeah.

1179
01:05:28,167 --> 01:05:32,269
But he says that he learned
everything he knows for my mom.

1180
01:05:32,271 --> 01:05:35,506
They sound like
awesome parents.

1181
01:05:35,508 --> 01:05:37,875
They are.

1182
01:05:37,877 --> 01:05:39,477
They were.

1183
01:05:39,479 --> 01:05:42,012
My mum passed away when I was
six.

1184
01:05:43,916 --> 01:05:47,184
Claire. I'm... so sorry.

1185
01:05:48,855 --> 01:05:51,355
Can I ask what happened?

1186
01:05:52,358 --> 01:05:54,992
Yeah. Yeah. it was
a car accident.

1187
01:05:55,895 --> 01:05:59,797
And ever since then
it's just been me and my dad.

1188
01:06:00,933 --> 01:06:03,033
Swimming always kept us close.

1189
01:06:04,070 --> 01:06:06,804
Well. he must be
so proud of you.

1190
01:06:12,345 --> 01:06:15,212
The only reason why my parents
care about swimming

1191
01:06:15,214 --> 01:06:19,183
is because it gives them an
excuse to send me off to camp.

1192
01:06:20,853 --> 01:06:23,788
They leave for Bali
the minute I'm gone.

1193
01:06:24,991 --> 01:06:27,424
They haven't invited me once.

1194
01:06:30,797 --> 01:06:32,530
They've gotta recognise that
you're one of the best swimmers

1195
01:06:32,532 --> 01:06:33,798
in the country though. right?

1196
01:06:35,535 --> 01:06:37,535
I honestly don't know.

1197
01:06:39,906 --> 01:06:43,073
But I'm hoping if I keep
winning my meets.

1198
01:06:43,075 --> 01:06:47,077
then... then they'll
start watching me.

1199
01:06:50,483 --> 01:06:53,417
That's why I work so hard.

1200
01:06:53,419 --> 01:06:55,820
And hey. even if your parents
don't say it...

1201
01:06:56,455 --> 01:06:58,522
I know they care about you.

1202
01:06:59,826 --> 01:07:01,258
It's OK.

1203
01:07:02,128 --> 01:07:04,094
This club is my home.

1204
01:07:05,097 --> 01:07:06,997
But...

1205
01:07:06,999 --> 01:07:10,067
I don't know what I'd do
if we lose it.

1206
01:07:11,904 --> 01:07:15,472
I'll do everything I can
to help you keep it.

1207
01:07:15,474 --> 01:07:17,341
Thanks.

1208
01:07:17,343 --> 01:07:22,913
[lively calypso music]

1209

[sings] I got some wheatgrass...

1210
01:07:24,283 --> 01:07:25,950
wheatgrass. wheatgrass.

1211

Oh. oh. oh. [gurgles]

1212
01:07:29,188 --> 01:07:31,555

-You got up early?
-Yep.

1216
01:07:49,108 --> 01:07:51,208
-To swim.
-Yep.

1217
01:07:51,210 --> 01:07:53,978
Is this following your heart.
bro?

1218
01:07:53,980 --> 01:07:55,980
This is maintaining my pride.

1219
01:07:55,982 --> 01:07:58,949
Yeah. besides. can't let
my roomie show me up.

1220
01:08:00,052 --> 01:08:04,455
Namaste. One for you.
One for you.

1221
01:08:04,457 --> 01:08:07,658
Come on. you know you want to.

1222
01:08:07,660 --> 01:08:10,027
Gonna win championships.

1223
01:08:10,029 --> 01:08:11,295
-OK.

1224
01:08:11,297 --> 01:08:13,264
[both sniff] Er.

1225
01:08:13,266 --> 01:08:15,165
Cooper!

1226
01:08:15,167 --> 01:08:16,433
Good to see you.

1227
01:08:16,435 --> 01:08:18,969
Why don't you start us off
with some laps?

1228
01:08:18,971 --> 01:08:21,272
I'm already regretting this.

1229
01:08:25,011 --> 01:08:26,377
Ugh!

1230
01:08:38,491 --> 01:08:40,591
Alright. everyone. Bring it in.

1231
01:08:40,593 --> 01:08:42,026
[whistle peeps]

1232
01:08:43,095 --> 01:08:45,462
Alright. This is
our last practice.

1233
01:08:46,599 --> 01:08:50,501
So take the rest of today
to focus and just rest up.

1234
01:08:51,570 --> 01:08:53,637
I'm really proud of all of you

1235

and dedication.

01:09:05,551 --> 01:09:07,685
[Liam] Claire. thank you.

1240
01:09:07,687 --> 01:09:10,087
This is the best prepared
we've ever been for a race.

1241
01:09:10,089 --> 01:09:11,989
And you know what?
If the Changs win.

1242
01:09:11,991 --> 01:09:13,457
at least we know
we gave it our best shot.

1243
01:09:13,459 --> 01:09:16,660
For ourselves. our team.
for the camp.

1244
01:09:16,662 --> 01:09:19,363
No. you'll beat them.
I know you will.

1245
01:09:20,199 --> 01:09:21,732
Just gotta believe in yourself.

1246
01:09:21,734 --> 01:09:23,968
Thanks.

1247
01:09:23,970 --> 01:09:27,071
Alright. well. I'm gonna
head back to my room.

1248
01:09:27,073 --> 01:09:29,506
I gotta organise...
something...

1249
01:09:29,508 --> 01:09:32,343
I'll catch up with you later.
[giggles]

1250

do you want to go for a walk?

1251
01:09:37,516 --> 01:09:39,583
Yeah. sure.

1252
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:44,488

I'm really glad I came here.

1255
01:10:01,707 --> 01:10:03,340
Yeah. it was brave of you.

1256
01:10:03,342 --> 01:10:04,708
It could not have been easy

1257
01:10:04,710 --> 01:10:07,344
coaching a bunch of boys
in another country

1258
01:10:07,346 --> 01:10:09,680
but you made it work.

1259
01:10:09,682 --> 01:10:12,149
Claire. these are the fastest
times we've had.

1260
01:10:12,151 --> 01:10:14,318
Well. I had passionate.
dedicated swimmers.

1261
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:16,320
Oh. well. thank you.

1262
01:10:16,322 --> 01:10:18,789
So your parents are letting you
swim tomorrow?

1263
01:10:20,426 --> 01:10:23,093
I worked it out.

1264
01:10:23,095 --> 01:10:25,062
Liam...

1265
01:10:25,064 --> 01:10:27,331
some people never
find their passion.

1266
01:10:27,333 --> 01:10:28,799
And you have.

1267
01:10:28,801 --> 01:10:31,402
-You shouldn't give that up.
-It's not that simple.

1268
01:10:32,304 --> 01:10:34,104
You of all people
should know that.

1269
01:10:36,108 --> 01:10:37,608
Look. Claire.
don't get me wrong.

1270
01:10:37,610 --> 01:10:40,310
I have complete faith
you'll get back in the pool

1271
01:10:40,312 --> 01:10:42,079
and you'll dominate again.

1272
01:10:43,682 --> 01:10:45,449
I don't know.

1273
01:10:45,451 --> 01:10:48,118
I think my swimming days
are over.

1274
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:50,554
And I think I'm OK with that.

1275
01:10:52,191 --> 01:10:54,291
For what it's worth...

1276
01:10:54,293 --> 01:10:57,594
I think you're the best coach
we've ever had.

1277
01:10:57,596 --> 01:11:00,164
I mean. we've only ever had
Coach Bodhi...

Well. that means a lot.

01:11:05,204 --> 01:11:07,137
Hey. I wanted to ask you...

1281

do you want to be
