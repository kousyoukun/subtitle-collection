00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:35,073
-Uh...

182
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,775
I was promised my own room.

183
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:39,611
The sky promises rain...

184
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:41,046
yet there are deserts.

185
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,649
This is the only available bed.

186
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:46,284
OK. I guess I'll make it work.

187
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:51,623
-Mikayla Michaels?
-Claire Carpenter?

188
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,692
I cannot live with her.

189
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:55,760
I have a rigorous training
schedule and this disruption...

190
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,062
What is she even doing here?

191
00:09:57,064 --> 00:09:58,196
I'm coaching.

192
00:09:58,198 --> 00:09:59,798
Coaching what? Your ego?

193
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,033
Coaching future champions,
something you'll never be.

194
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:03,902
I championed all over you
last time.

195
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:06,271
-Oh come on.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

196
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:07,939
Feel the energy.

197
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:13,111
Visualise a friendship
blossoming between you.

198
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,680
If you can imagine it...

199
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:17,148
you can will it into reality.

200
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,383
What?

201
00:10:18,385 --> 00:10:20,352
That doesn't make any sense.

202
00:10:20,354 --> 00:10:21,886
Or does it?

203
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:31,896
[both groan]

204
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:44,175
You have an extra centimetre?

205
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:45,644
[scoffs]

206
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:52,083
-Happy?
-Not really.

207
00:10:57,057 --> 00:10:59,691
-Hey!
-What now?

208
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,227
We'll need to agree
on some rules.

209
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,434
They'll have to do for now.

210
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:11,269
That counts as conversation.

211
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:12,804
[laughs]

212
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,306
[indistinct chatter]

213
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:16,841
Thank you.

214
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:26,151
[indistinct chatter]

215
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:46,705
[shrieks]

216
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:48,173
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

217
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:53,195
They told me you were here

218
00:11:53,196 --> 00:11:54,479
but I thought they were
playing a joke on me,

219
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:56,314
like when they told me
a tidal wave was coming here.

220
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:58,049
So I wore a life-vest
for a week.

221
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,351
But you're not like that
tidal wave, you're real.

222
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:01,853
Remember to breathe.

223
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:03,221
I'm Annabelle Shumpert.

224
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,923
Is that a name or a condition?

225
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:07,792
President of the Australia
Branch of the Claire Army.

226
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:10,995
I'm a Claire Bear for life.

227
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,798
I am your biggest fan.

228
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,967
Like, I know there's
that one fan in Belgium

229
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:18,002
who says she's the biggest
but she's lying

230
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:19,471
and I will fight her.

231
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,208
It was nice to meet you,

232
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:25,210
but I haven't eaten
since the plane, so...

233
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:27,378
Follow me.

234
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,914
Move! Claire Carpenter
coming through.

235
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,750
[soft quirky music]

236
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:45,797
So, cafeteria's only open
at mealtimes

237
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:47,866
but you can get snacks
whenever you want.

238
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:52,137
Oh and don't forget, three
daily servings of Emu Milk.

239
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,540
Your emus make milk?

240
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:57,942
Not exactly.

241
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:00,245
I wouldn't look into it
too deeply.

242
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:11,422
Maybe we should just focus on
eating

243
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:13,224
and not talking.

244
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:15,794
Yeah. Yeah. We should.

245
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:17,395
Yeah.

246
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:18,830
Yay.

247
00:13:18,832 --> 00:13:20,799
So, where have you been
the last two months?

248
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:22,167
Do you like Australia?

249
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:23,618
Are you gonna swim for us?

250
00:13:23,619 --> 00:13:25,068
Does that mean you have
dual citizenship?

251
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:27,372
Do you have a secret
Australian sister? Is it me?

252
00:13:27,374 --> 00:13:28,940
Could it be me?

253
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:31,009
Can I be... Could it be?

254
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:32,277
Amy, right?

255
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,913
It's Annabelle. It's fine.

256
00:13:34,915 --> 00:13:36,365
Annabelle...

257
00:13:36,366 --> 00:13:37,816
I'm just going to take this
to my room.

258
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:39,350
Just... I'm so tired.

259
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:42,854
Oh, yeah. Yeah,
makes sense. Yeah.

260
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:44,556
-Wanna high five?
-Sorry.

261
00:13:44,558 --> 00:13:46,224
Yep, it's fine.

262
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:47,891
[reporter]<i> We attempted to</i>
<i> interview her and...</i>

263
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:50,078
<i> Well, see for yourself.</i>

264
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,263
<i> It looked like you were afraid</i>
<i> of the water?</i> [shrieks]

265
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,966
[Claire] No cameras.

266
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:57,402
[giggling]

267
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:00,839
Coops?

268
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:03,007
Cooper! Bro, you're
not even listening.

269
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,576
I'm totally lost
on this new map.

270
00:14:04,578 --> 00:14:06,945
Not as lost as this girl
I met this morning.

271
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:08,213
[video game pauses]

272
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:09,447
A girl?

273
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:12,150
Yeah, some American.

274
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:14,219
And what's she doing here?

275
00:14:14,221 --> 00:14:16,421
Swimming with the girls' team,
I guess.

276
00:14:17,924 --> 00:14:19,190
Is she cute?

277
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:25,063
Ooh-la-la, Liam's in love!

278
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:26,531
I can't afford
to get distracted.

279
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,967
Maybe your parents
will lighten up.

280
00:14:28,969 --> 00:14:31,402
Oh, yeah. Not until
I'm Dr. Liam Henderson.

281
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:34,405
Of course, bro, it won't matter
if the camp closes.

282
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:39,477
[scoffs] If the camp closes,
I'm gonna be a full-time gamer.

283
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:40,912
[video game restarts]

284
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,248
-Is that right?
-Mm-hmm.

285
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:46,084
-Well, until then...
-[groans]

286
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:47,986
...we got practice. Let's go.

287
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,658
[chuckles]

288
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:57,295
I'm sorry, but who steams
their swimsuit?

289
00:14:57,297 --> 00:14:59,397
Some of us like
to look our best.

290
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:02,934
Well, it's just gonna get wet.

291
00:15:02,936 --> 00:15:05,069
Yours managed to stay dry.

292
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:13,278
Alright, well, try not to steal
anything while I'm gone.

293
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:19,417
-Howdy!
-[gasps]

294
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,920
They say that in America,
right?

295
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:23,321
Anyway, I was thinking -

296
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:26,124
so, an athlete of your stature
has so many obligations.

297
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:29,928
you know, like autographs and
endorsements and award shows.

298
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,996
Where you going with this?

299
00:15:31,998 --> 00:15:37,035
Maybe, like,
I should be your, um...

300
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:39,704
...assistant?

301
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:42,373
Maybe?

302
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:46,678
A little bit?

303
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:49,981
Yeah, you know, I guess
I could use an intern.

304
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:51,482
[gasps] OK.

305
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:53,451
Alright, first order of
business...

306
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,620
show me where the boys practice.

307
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:57,288
[gong sounds]

308
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,458
Swimmers, gather round.

309
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:04,062
Come in, come in.

310
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:07,265
Namaste.

311
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:13,705
As you know, Nationals are
less than four weeks away

312
00:16:13,707 --> 00:16:19,310
and we've got to be
one with the water

313
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,312
and centre ourselves mentally.

314
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:22,981
[laughter]

315
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:25,516
To help us with
the final mile,

316
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:27,652
I've expanded our collective

317
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:31,289
to include
another passionate coach.

318
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:32,423
Oh, here we go.

319
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:35,877
And who better than another
swimmer

320
00:16:35,878 --> 00:16:39,330
who won two gold medals at the
last World Championships?

321
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:43,201
She's one of America's
top athletes.

322
00:16:43,203 --> 00:16:46,137
Give it up
for Claire Carpenter.

323
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:47,739
[Annabelle] Whoo!

324
00:16:47,741 --> 00:16:49,073
[Bodhi] Whoo!

325
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:50,475
Hi.

326
00:16:51,745 --> 00:16:54,312
Oh! Um... Catastrophe Claire!

327
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:55,413
[scattered laughter]

328
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:57,048
So... some of you
have heard of me.

329
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,050
No cameras. No cameras.

330
00:16:59,052 --> 00:17:00,251
[shrieks]

331
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:03,788
I just want to say

332
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:06,724
that I'm excited to get to know
each and every one of you

333
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:08,559
and help out with training.

334
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:11,029
Yeah, help out with training!

335
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:13,765
And with that I'll introduce
our team captain,

336
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:15,566
Liam Henderson.

337
00:17:18,605 --> 00:17:21,105
-I didn't realise.
-You're...

338
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:22,440
That's right.

339
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:24,108
You two have already met.

340
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,077
[chuckles] Silly me!

341
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:30,114
So...

342
00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:32,583
-...how would you like to start?
-[Cooper] Come on?

343
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:37,121
She doesn't even swim anymore.

344
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:40,758
[whispering]

345
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,261
She's still swims. You swim.

346
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:44,395
Right? Don't you?

347
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,431
Yeah, of course. I swim.

348
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:49,400
I'm just on a break but...

349
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:52,236
It doesn't mean
that I can't coach.

350
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:54,072
[voice whispers]
Can't take this seriously.

351
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:55,506
Look, I'm sorry but...

352
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:58,276
I don't think
this is a good idea.

353
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:01,579
OK.

354
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:02,780
[gong crashes]

355
00:18:02,782 --> 00:18:04,348
[yelling]

356
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:10,121
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean...

357
00:18:10,123 --> 00:18:12,657
It's OK. I'll handle
the rest of practice.

358
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:14,292
[laughter]

359
00:18:14,294 --> 00:18:16,627
Catastrophe Claire
strikes again!

360
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:18,329

How high is that?

894
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:04,480
About three metres,
give or take.

895
00:48:11,122 --> 00:48:13,055
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

896
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:18,194
Don't worry. No-one's
going to make you jump.

897
00:48:18,196 --> 00:48:19,362
Yeah. Hard pass.

898
00:48:20,565 --> 00:48:22,365
I figured.

899
00:48:22,367 --> 00:48:24,467
Well, let me know
if you change your mind.

900
00:48:24,469 --> 00:48:26,469
[man] Yeah! Whoo!

901
00:48:28,273 --> 00:48:31,374
[upbeat pop music continues]

902
00:48:34,946 --> 00:48:36,145
Yeah!

903
00:48:37,382 --> 00:48:39,682
Whoo-hoo!

904
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:47,189
[Mikayla] What are you doing?

905
00:48:47,191 --> 00:48:49,125
Not sure what you're
referring to Mikayla .

906
00:48:49,127 --> 00:48:51,327
Don't play dumb. Why are you
being nice to that girl?

907
00:48:51,329 --> 00:48:53,095
I heard she's
torturing your team.

908
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:54,463
Torture?

909
00:48:54,465 --> 00:48:57,266
That's a pretty strong word,
OK?

910
00:48:57,268 --> 00:48:59,969
Accurate, but strong.

911
00:48:59,971 --> 00:49:02,138
Then why put up with her?

912
00:49:04,475 --> 00:49:06,275
We're getting better.

913
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:08,945
Really?

914
00:49:14,485 --> 00:49:17,520
Well, I should hope so.
The meet's in two weeks.

915
00:49:17,522 --> 00:49:19,121
My squad will be ready.

916
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:22,358
Hope her coaching pays off.
The team depends on it.

917
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:23,459
Mmm.

918
00:49:26,731 --> 00:49:29,632
Come on, Annabelle!
You got this!

919
00:49:29,634 --> 00:49:32,201
Three, two, one...
-OK.

920
00:49:32,203 --> 00:49:34,036
[screams]

921
00:49:36,507 --> 00:49:38,107
Yeah! [laughs]

922
00:49:38,109 --> 00:49:40,710
Oh, my gold, it's cod! Ooh!

923
00:49:47,552 --> 00:49:50,987
Oh, I found you!

924
00:49:50,989 --> 00:49:53,489
Thought you were
eaten by a dingo.

925
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:55,424
No such luck.

926
00:49:56,627 --> 00:49:59,261
Want to talk about it?

927
00:49:59,263 --> 00:50:00,696
No.

928
00:50:03,234 --> 00:50:06,268
Claire Army Field Manual
rule number 14,

929
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:08,504
"Don't be afraid
to ask for help."

930
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:14,110
Why do you believe in me?

931
00:50:14,746 --> 00:50:16,746
Are you serious?

932
00:50:16,748 --> 00:50:19,281
Because you're, like,
the queen of swimming.

933
00:50:19,283 --> 00:50:20,516
Because you have
the greatest flip turn

934
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:22,084
the world has ever seen.

935
00:50:22,085 --> 00:50:23,651
Because you've got, like, a
bajillion Instagram followers.

936
00:50:23,654 --> 00:50:26,288
Stop me if this is too much.

937
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:28,491
Can I ask you something?

938
00:50:28,493 --> 00:50:30,026
Hit me.

939
00:50:31,062 --> 00:50:32,728
Do you like me?

940
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:34,397
Like, as a person.

941
00:50:36,768 --> 00:50:39,068
[Annabelle] Of course I do.

942
00:50:41,105 --> 00:50:42,538
As a friend?

943
00:50:45,443 --> 00:50:46,776
We're friends?

944
00:50:48,279 --> 00:50:51,113
I mean, if we're not,
I don't think I have any.

945
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:55,651
I was happy being your
assistant but...

946
00:50:56,721 --> 00:50:58,687
I'd like to be your friend.

947
00:50:59,624 --> 00:51:01,757
Yeah, I'd like that too.

948
00:51:04,462 --> 00:51:06,495
Can I be honest with you...

949
00:51:06,497 --> 00:51:08,364

950
00:51:12,236 --> 00:51:14,203
I just don't recognise myself.

951
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:19,275
Like, when did I become
this disagreeable person?

952
00:51:20,778 --> 00:51:22,711
[Annabelle] Did something
happen?

953
00:51:22,713 --> 00:51:25,281
All of a sudden,
you just stopped swimming.

954
00:51:27,251 --> 00:51:29,318
Yeah, it's complicated.

955
00:51:30,855 --> 00:51:32,288
[Annabelle] You know...

956
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:34,457
my grandma always
used to say...

957
00:51:35,293 --> 00:51:38,828
"It's not what happens to us
that defines us.

958
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:40,863
"It's how we handle it."

959
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:47,336
So, do friends hug?

960
00:51:48,339 --> 00:51:50,706
-I pushed it, didn't I?
-Mm-hmm.

961
00:51:58,816 --> 00:52:00,316
-Hey...

962
00:52:01,152 --> 00:52:02,685
can we talk?

963
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:07,123
-Wanted to apologise--
-What?

964
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:10,559
Wait, what?

965
00:52:10,561 --> 00:52:14,230
I know I haven't exactly
been the easiest to live with.

966
00:52:15,333 --> 00:52:17,600
You've got a real knack
for understatement.

967
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:21,770
And I wanted to say
that I'm sorry.

968
00:52:21,772 --> 00:52:24,273
I've been going through some...

969
00:52:24,275 --> 00:52:26,242
stuff.

970
00:52:26,244 --> 00:52:29,145
That doesn't mean
I should take it out on you.

971
00:52:30,414 --> 00:52:33,415
Well, I'm sorry for
the water balloon prank.

972
00:52:35,453 --> 00:52:38,454
And I want you to know
that I forgive you...

973
00:52:38,456 --> 00:52:40,789
for stealing my lucky goggles.

974
00:52:42,326 --> 00:52:44,160
I never stole your goggles.

975
00:52:44,162 --> 00:52:46,395
Oh come on. I saw you.

The Americas meet.

977
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:56,605
I went to go shower and put
my goggles in the locker...

978
00:52:57,508 --> 00:52:59,275
saw you.

979
00:53:05,449 --> 00:53:08,784
When I came back,
they were gone.

980
00:53:11,322 --> 00:53:13,289
And so are my goggles.

981
00:53:14,892 --> 00:53:17,560
I swear I never took them.

982
00:53:18,563 --> 00:53:20,329
I remember that day.

983
00:53:21,632 --> 00:53:23,532
As soon as you went
in to shower,

984
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:25,801
guess who else walked in.

985
00:53:25,803 --> 00:53:27,670
Elsa Chang.

986
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:31,307
No! Why didn't you tell me?

987
00:53:34,579 --> 00:53:36,345
Would you have listened?

988
00:53:38,649 --> 00:53:41,317
That really messed with me.

989
00:53:41,319 --> 00:53:43,852
After that, I lost the race
to Elsa and then...

990
00:53:44,789 --> 00:53:47,423
I went water skiing
to clear my head.

991
00:53:48,993 --> 00:53:51,794
I was awful to you
for no reason.

992
00:53:51,796 --> 00:53:54,230
I haven't been much better.

993
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:57,700
Can we start over?

994
00:53:59,003 --> 00:54:00,769
I'd like that.

this time. She means it.

not to breathe flats to wall.

[Claire] Nice, Cooper.

00:54:55,993 --> 00:54:57,893
Mike, your dolphin kicks
were great

1003
00:54:57,895 --> 00:54:59,628
but your dive was too deep.

1006

Great job, everyone. Nice work.

Who is this person?

1008
00:55:23,821 --> 00:55:25,721

How was practice today?

1015
00:55:47,945 --> 00:55:51,447
I'm still one-tenth
of a second behind.

1016
00:55:53,084 --> 00:55:56,952
It's never easy
right before a meet, is it?

1017
00:55:58,856 --> 00:56:00,989
I just... I get so tense.

1018
00:56:00,991 --> 00:56:03,992
And if one thing's out of
place, it just throws me off.

1019
00:56:03,994 --> 00:56:06,528
Oh, yeah, I feel that.

1020
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:08,997
Once I ran out of low-volume
conditioner right before a meet

1021
00:56:08,999 --> 00:56:11,066
and I freaked out

1022
00:56:11,067 --> 00:56:13,134
because I was convinced it would
change the drag on my swim cap.

1023
00:56:13,137 --> 00:56:14,703
No way!

1024
00:56:14,705 --> 00:56:15,804
[laughs]

1025
00:56:15,806 --> 00:56:17,873
Well, once, I came second

1026
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:19,808
the day I had an omelette
for breakfast.

1027
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:21,510
So?

1028
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:24,747
So I haven't had eggs
in two years.

1029
00:56:24,749 --> 00:56:27,049
[laughs] My gosh.

1030
00:56:27,051 --> 00:56:28,768
Seriously, though.

1031
00:56:28,769 --> 00:56:30,486
I'm the most superstitious
swimmer you'll ever meet.

1032
00:56:30,488 --> 00:56:31,987
I just wish I could relax.

1033
00:56:31,989 --> 00:56:34,156
Yeah, maybe you should
try meditation.

1034
00:56:35,593 --> 00:56:37,993
Not that I'm suggesting
you go full Coach Bodhi, but...

1035
00:56:38,963 --> 00:56:41,163
What did you even
say to Coach Bodhi?

1036
00:56:42,133 --> 00:56:44,933
I told them that
I had a vision...

1037
00:56:46,404 --> 00:56:49,471
of him just visualising
victory for the boys

1038
00:56:49,473 --> 00:56:51,807
and growing produce for them.

1039
00:56:51,809 --> 00:56:53,876
Yeah. [laughs]

1040
00:56:53,878 --> 00:56:55,911
That's so funny.

1041
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:57,946
I reckon you'll get along
with the girls.

1042
00:56:57,948 --> 00:56:59,581
Yeah?

1043
00:56:59,583 --> 00:57:02,184
You should join us for dinner
tomorrow.

Guys, I am so proud of you

1050
00:57:17,935 --> 00:57:19,868
and the hard work you've been
putting in.

1051
00:57:19,870 --> 00:57:23,672
So to finish off practice,
instead of ending with sprints,

1052
00:57:23,674 --> 00:57:26,141
let's end with a different kind
of competition.

greased watermelon

00:58:27,972 --> 00:58:29,705
Hey, Coops.

1072
00:58:29,707 --> 00:58:32,007
-Hey, Catastrophe Claire.
-Mmm.

1073
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:35,110
I'll never live that down. Wow.

1074
00:58:35,112 --> 00:58:38,247
Shouldn't you be making
everyone laugh over there?

1075
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:43,519
Nah. They're talking
about swimming... again.

1076
00:58:44,755 --> 00:58:49,892
You know, sometimes it's just
good to have a break.

1077
00:58:49,894 --> 00:58:51,593
Yeah.

1078
00:58:52,263 --> 00:58:53,996
I get it.

1079
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:58,634
What do you reckon, Claire?

1080
00:58:58,636 --> 00:59:00,168
Are you gonna go back
to swimming?

1081
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:02,204
Are you ever gonna
try it again, or...?

1082
00:59:03,707 --> 00:59:05,908
I mean, I don't know.

1083
00:59:05,910 --> 00:59:09,645
I've been training
and doing it my whole life.

1084
00:59:09,647 --> 00:59:10,746
Yeah.

1085
00:59:10,748 --> 00:59:13,081
It's been really nice
just being here.

1086
00:59:13,083 --> 00:59:14,750
And being normal.

1087
00:59:15,953 --> 00:59:18,887
You gotta do
what makes you happy.

1088
00:59:18,889 --> 00:59:21,023
[whispers] Gotta do
what makes you happy.

1089
00:59:23,594 --> 00:59:25,894
-Alright. Thanks, Claire.
-Bye.

1090
00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:27,629
Bye.

1091
00:59:28,966 --> 00:59:30,732
[soft music]

1092
00:59:39,343 --> 00:59:42,010
Hey.

1093
00:59:42,012 --> 00:59:44,179
You're missing
a pretty cool night.

1094
00:59:46,684 --> 00:59:49,217
I spoke to my parents tonight.

1095
00:59:53,223 --> 00:59:56,058
They know the dean
of the medical school.

1096
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:58,260
The day of the meet?

1097
00:59:59,129 --> 01:00:01,096
Just feels like...

1098
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:03,665
my swimming career is over,
you know?

1099
01:00:03,667 --> 01:00:05,701
No, you love swimming.

1100
01:00:05,703 --> 01:00:07,703
I see it out there from you
every day.

1101
01:00:07,705 --> 01:00:09,905
Yeah, my parents
don't get that.

1102
01:00:11,175 --> 01:00:13,075
I just wish...

1103
01:00:13,077 --> 01:00:15,310
One of them had been
a swimmer, you know?

1104
01:00:15,312 --> 01:00:18,113
And then maybe
they'd understand.

1105
01:00:18,115 --> 01:00:21,650
Well, having an ex-Olympian dad
isn't much easier.

1106
01:00:21,652 --> 01:00:24,052
The constant pressure
to succeed.

1107
01:00:25,923 --> 01:00:28,090
It's better than
constant pressure to quit.

1108
01:00:29,093 --> 01:00:31,059
Mmm.

1109
01:00:31,061 --> 01:00:33,328
[soft music]

1110
01:00:48,178 --> 01:00:50,379
I don't want this camp to end.

1111
01:00:51,715 --> 01:00:54,349
It's been pretty great,
hasn't it?

1112
01:00:56,153 --> 01:00:58,887
[Liam] Do you have to go back
to America?

1113
01:00:58,889 --> 01:01:00,756
Are you really going to
quit swimming?

1114
01:01:08,666 --> 01:01:10,999
[indistinct chatter]

1115
01:01:11,869 --> 01:01:14,403
[Mikayla] Maybe some more...
colour.

1116
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:17,706
I don't know.

1117
01:01:22,913 --> 01:01:25,247
Attention everybody!
Listen up!

1118
01:01:25,249 --> 01:01:27,149
I just received
an urgent communique

1119
01:01:27,151 --> 01:01:29,418
from the Claire Army
Field Office in Sydney.

1120
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:31,286
This Claire Army thing
is really getting out of hand.

1121
01:01:31,288 --> 01:01:33,288
According to my source,

1122
01:01:33,289 --> 01:01:35,289
the Changs just posted new
personal bests in practice.

1123
01:01:35,292 --> 01:01:36,992
[collective groans]

1124
01:01:36,994 --> 01:01:38,927
We'll be facing the fastest
qualifying times

1125
01:01:38,929 --> 01:01:40,929
in the history of Nationals.

1126
01:01:46,103 --> 01:01:48,236
You're supposed to tell me
things like this

1127
01:01:48,238 --> 01:01:50,305
before you just
say them to everyone.

1128
01:01:50,307 --> 01:01:52,674
They're just so fast.

1129
01:01:52,675 --> 01:01:55,042
I know, but when the waters
get rough, swimmers get tough.

1130
01:01:55,045 --> 01:01:56,745
You got this.

1131
01:01:58,916 --> 01:02:00,916
[soft piano music]

1132
01:02:02,252 --> 01:02:04,419
OK, guys, I know it's no fun
getting up this early

1133
01:02:04,421 --> 01:02:07,222
but I will do everything I can
to prep you.

1134
01:02:07,224 --> 01:02:09,258
So let's start off
with technique,

1135
01:02:09,259 --> 01:02:11,293
because you get enough endurance
training at team practice.

1136
01:02:11,295 --> 01:02:12,828
I will practice
every waking minute

1137
01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:14,329
if it helps me
beat Elsa Chang.

1138
01:02:14,331 --> 01:02:18,300
Start with a quick warm-up,
then show me those flip turns.

1139
01:02:20,504 --> 01:02:22,370
[both laugh]

1140
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:34,282
Looking good.

1141
01:02:34,284 --> 01:02:35,817
They can be better, though.

1142
01:02:36,987 --> 01:02:38,887
Let me explain how I do it.

1143
01:02:40,390 --> 01:02:43,925
So, basically, it's a corkscrew
twist off the wall.

1144
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:50,799
You flip less as you turn and
then twist as you streamline.

1145
01:02:52,035 --> 01:02:53,969
[soft uplifting music]

1146
01:02:59,076 --> 01:03:00,408
Yeah,
just twist a split-second later,

1147
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:01,943
it'll be even better.

1148
01:03:05,315 --> 01:03:07,949
[Annabelle] Claire Field Army
Manual number five.

1149
01:03:07,951 --> 01:03:10,051
Early bird gets the fish.

1150
01:03:10,053 --> 01:03:12,053
And...

1151
01:03:12,055 --> 01:03:14,523
So, do you think
I could join in?

1152
01:03:14,525 --> 01:03:16,324
Get over here.

1153
01:03:18,428 --> 01:03:20,262
Yeah, let's see those again.

1154
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:31,540
Nice, Liam!

1155
01:03:31,542 --> 01:03:34,442
-That actually felt faster.
-Yeah, it looks faster.

1156
01:03:34,444 --> 01:03:36,244
Claire, thank you.

1157
01:03:38,348 --> 01:03:40,582
[snores]

1158
01:03:43,921 --> 01:03:46,154
[moans]

1159
01:03:49,159 --> 01:03:53,061
How was your
insanely early practice?

1160
01:03:53,063 --> 01:03:55,063
-It was good.
-Yeah.

1161
01:03:55,065 --> 01:03:57,265
I'm starving. You ready?

1162
01:03:57,267 --> 01:03:59,901
Yeah, I'll... Hold on...

1163
01:04:00,537 --> 01:04:02,470
I'm still waking up.

1164
01:04:04,174 --> 01:04:07,008
She worked us pretty hard
today.

1165
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:11,847
Ah... The things
we do for love.

1166
01:04:11,849 --> 01:04:14,015
Whoo. [laughs]

1167
01:04:15,052 --> 01:04:17,552
Oi, dude! [laughs]

1168
01:04:17,554 --> 01:04:20,455
-We're just friends.
-Yeah.

1169
01:04:20,457 --> 01:04:22,390
Follow your heart, bro.

1170
01:04:23,327 --> 01:04:26,862
Nah. Otherwise,
you're just wasting time.

1171
01:04:28,966 --> 01:04:31,233
[both] 148...

1172
01:04:32,369 --> 01:04:36,404
149... 150.

1173
01:04:36,406 --> 01:04:38,440
[both laugh]

1174
01:04:38,442 --> 01:04:42,110
Why are 150 push-ups
so much harder than 140?

1175
01:04:42,112 --> 01:04:44,012
Dawn practice was rough.

1176
01:04:44,014 --> 01:04:47,649
Morning was miserable and this
afternoon was excruciating.

1177
01:04:48,619 --> 01:04:51,453
Still on for early morning
practice tomorrow?

1178
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:53,455
Oh, definitely.

1179
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:59,327
So... how do you learn
to coach so well? Your dad?

1180
01:05:00,530 --> 01:05:02,230
Yeah.

1181
01:05:03,333 --> 01:05:07,435
But he says that he learned
everything he knows for my mom.

1182
01:05:07,437 --> 01:05:10,672
They sound like
awesome parents.

1183
01:05:10,674 --> 01:05:13,041
They are.

1184
01:05:13,043 --> 01:05:14,643
They were.

1185
01:05:14,645 --> 01:05:17,178
My mum passed away when I was
six.

1186
01:05:19,082 --> 01:05:22,350
Claire, I'm... so sorry.

1187
01:05:24,021 --> 01:05:26,521
Can I ask what happened?

1188
01:05:27,524 --> 01:05:30,158
Yeah. Yeah, it was
a car accident.

1189
01:05:31,061 --> 01:05:34,963
And ever since then
it's just been me and my dad.

1190
01:05:36,099 --> 01:05:38,199
Swimming always kept us close.

1191
01:05:39,236 --> 01:05:41,970
Well, he must be
so proud of you.

1192
01:05:47,511 --> 01:05:50,378
The only reason why my parents
care about swimming

1193
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:54,349
is because it gives them an
excuse to send me off to camp.

1194
01:05:56,019 --> 01:05:58,954
They leave for Bali
the minute I'm gone.

1195
01:06:00,157 --> 01:06:02,590
They haven't invited me once.

1196
01:06:05,963 --> 01:06:07,696
They've gotta recognise that
you're one of the best swimmers

1197
01:06:07,698 --> 01:06:08,964
in the country though, right?

1198
01:06:10,701 --> 01:06:12,701
I honestly don't know.

1199
01:06:15,072 --> 01:06:18,239
But I'm hoping if I keep
winning my meets,

1200
01:06:18,241 --> 01:06:22,243
then... then they'll
start watching me.

1201
01:06:25,649 --> 01:06:28,583
That's why I work so hard.

1202
01:06:28,585 --> 01:06:30,986
And hey, even if your parents
don't say it...

1203
01:06:31,621 --> 01:06:33,688
I know they care about you.

1204
01:06:34,992 --> 01:06:36,424
It's OK.

1205
01:06:37,294 --> 01:06:39,260
This club is my home.

1206
01:06:40,263 --> 01:06:42,163
But...

1207
01:06:42,165 --> 01:06:45,233
I don't know what I'd do
if we lose it.

1208
01:06:47,070 --> 01:06:50,638
I'll do everything I can
to help you keep it.

1209
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:52,507
Thanks.

1210
01:06:52,509 --> 01:06:58,079
[lively calypso music]

1211
01:06:58,081 --> 01:06:59,447
[sings] I got some wheatgrass...

1212
01:06:59,449 --> 01:07:01,116
wheatgrass, wheatgrass.

1213
01:07:01,118 --> 01:07:04,352
Oh, oh, oh. [gurgles]

1214
01:07:04,354 --> 01:07:06,721
I've got wheatgrass...

1215
01:07:06,723 --> 01:07:09,124
Double shot!

1216
01:07:09,126 --> 01:07:13,395
[calypso music continues]

1217
01:07:22,139 --> 01:07:24,272
-You got up early?
-Yep.

1218
01:07:24,274 --> 01:07:26,374
-To swim.
-Yep.

1219
01:07:26,376 --> 01:07:29,144
Is this following your heart,
bro?

1220
01:07:29,146 --> 01:07:31,146
This is maintaining my pride.

1221
01:07:31,148 --> 01:07:34,115
Yeah, besides, can't let
my roomie show me up.

1222
01:07:35,218 --> 01:07:39,621
Namaste. One for you.
One for you.

1223
01:07:39,623 --> 01:07:42,824
Come on, you know you want to.

1224
01:07:42,826 --> 01:07:45,193
Gonna win championships.

1225
01:07:45,195 --> 01:07:46,461
-OK.

1226
01:07:46,463 --> 01:07:48,430
[both sniff] Er.

1227
01:07:48,432 --> 01:07:50,331
Cooper!

1228
01:07:50,333 --> 01:07:51,599
Good to see you.

1229
01:07:51,601 --> 01:07:54,135
Why don't you start us off
with some laps?

1230
01:07:54,137 --> 01:07:56,438
I'm already regretting this.

1231
01:08:00,177 --> 01:08:01,543
Ugh!

1232
01:08:13,657 --> 01:08:15,757
Alright, everyone. Bring it in.

1233
01:08:15,759 --> 01:08:17,192
[whistle peeps]

1234
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:20,628
Alright. This is
our last practice.

1235
01:08:21,765 --> 01:08:25,667
So take the rest of today
to focus and just rest up.

1236
01:08:26,736 --> 01:08:28,803
I'm really proud of all of you

1237
01:08:28,805 --> 01:08:30,738
for your hard work
and dedication.

1238
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:32,440
-[man] Thanks, Claire.
-[woman] Thanks, Claire.

1239
01:08:32,442 --> 01:08:33,575
Now let's win tomorrow!

1240
01:08:33,577 --> 01:08:36,277
[all cheer]

1241
01:08:40,717 --> 01:08:42,851
[Liam] Claire, thank you.

1242
01:08:42,853 --> 01:08:45,253
This is the best prepared
we've ever been for a race.

1243
01:08:45,255 --> 01:08:47,155
And you know what?
If the Changs win,

1244
