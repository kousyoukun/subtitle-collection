1
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:55,754
<i>- No, your name.
- Please tell me your name.</i>

2
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:58,424
My name is
Charles ruchowski.

3
00:00:58,426 --> 00:00:59,491
No!

4
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:07,166
Say the name,
Mr.... Mr. lake!

5
00:01:07,168 --> 00:01:10,369
Tell me, Mr. lake.
Tell me, what is his name?

6
00:01:10,371 --> 00:01:12,704
Huh? What is
the name of the spy?

7
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:14,540
What is the name
of the double?

8
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:17,309
My name is
Charles ruchowski...

9
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:19,178
- Okay.
- A representative

10
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,713
- for spirit systems.
- Uh-huh.

11
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:24,650
<i>- One more time.
- A representative...</i>

12
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,654
Well, you tell me...

13
00:01:28,656 --> 00:01:31,757
Just tell me,
Mr. lake...

14
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,626
- Charles ruchowski.
- - ...What I

15
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:37,096
need to know!

16
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:44,670
This... this doesn't end.

17
00:01:44,672 --> 00:01:45,871
<i>No no no.</i>

18
00:01:45,873 --> 00:01:47,406
It ends

19
00:01:47,408 --> 00:01:49,875
when you die!

20
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:59,785
<i>- Every year at this time,
- it is my pleasure...</i>

21
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:02,888
An honor, really...
To introduce

22
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,858
former deputy
station chief, Beirut,

23
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,193
chief of station Kabul,

24
00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:10,696
<i>holder of the Donovan award,</i>

25
00:02:10,698 --> 00:02:13,132
<i>the distinguished
intelligence medal</i>

26
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:15,834
and the only
living recipient

27
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:17,870
of the intelligence star,

28
00:02:17,872 --> 00:02:20,232
Evan lake.
Evan.

29
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:33,097
What the hell
are you doing here?

30
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:35,754
Haven't you heard?

31
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:39,324
The c.I.A. Fell
from the Berlin wall

32
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:42,261
and all the president's men
can't put it back
together again!

33
00:02:42,263 --> 00:02:43,762
It's broke!

34
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:46,698
Not reliable.
Not trustworthy.

35
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,800
Can't stand up
to the white house.

36
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:50,702
Backstabbers.

37
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:52,938
Watching porn,
tapping phones.

38
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,874
Best and brightest
quit or retired.

39
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,779
What in the name
of Jesus Christ nailed
to the cross

40
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:02,748
are you doing here?

41
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,853
Because you heard
the call.

42
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,888
That's why.

43
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:12,791
<i>Your future
spread out before you</i>

44
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:14,860
like a cruise-ship buffet.

45
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,730
You were teaching
in a classroom,

46
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:20,832
working in a kitchen,

47
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:23,302
training in a gym
and you heard the call.

48
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:26,838
For some
it was adventure.

49
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,474
For some, mystique.

50
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:33,512
For all, it was 9/11
and you heard the call,

51
00:03:33,514 --> 00:03:35,747
and it was
the call of duty

52
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:37,549
and love of country.

53
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,518
Why?

54
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,454
Because you have values!

55
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:53,899
Thanks again, ev.
We appreciate it.

56
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:55,867
- - Think they believed
a word of it?

57
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:58,704
- I did.
- You were always
an easy touch.

58
00:03:58,706 --> 00:04:01,607
I won't be here next year.
On my way out.

59
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:04,476
What? You're a pup.
What are you, 40?

60
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:07,579
- Got an offer
from the private sector.
- You'll miss it.

61
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:10,782
Maybe I'll come back
next year just to hear
your speech.

62
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:39,845
<i>- Die!</i>

63
00:04:39,847 --> 00:04:41,880
It ends...

64
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:45,017
- When you die!

65
00:04:46,854 --> 00:04:48,353
If you were
a reasonable man,

66
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:50,589
you and I
could talk about America.

67
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:52,624
You would drink
something,

68
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,626
you would... you would...
You would be set free.

69
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:55,927
But no no no.

70
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:57,963
- You want to...

71
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:03,035
- He wants to die, huh,
like, what? Crusader!

72
00:05:03,037 --> 00:05:06,305
Huh? No.
No, Mr. lake.

73
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:09,308
No, it's better
that you don't die.

74
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,842
- Charles ruchowski.
- No, you don't die.

75
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:12,511
- No no no no no.

76
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:14,079
Today, you suffer.

77
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,948
<i>- I was talking to someone
- down at the farm.</i>

78
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,517
They said you gave
a real barn burner
this morning.

79
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,520
What's on your mind?

80
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,522
When I started
riding a desk,

81
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,358
it was supposed
to be temporary.

82
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,959
That was six years ago.

83
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:03,962
- You've made your country
very proud.

84
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:08,967
I've gone through
all the proper channels,
I've submitted the paperwork,

85
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:10,635
but I can't seem
to reach anyone.

86
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:13,138
And I am sorry
to bother you with this.

87
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,841
How long have you been
in government service?

88
00:06:15,843 --> 00:06:18,643
Marines six years.
Agency 30.

89
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:21,012
S.I.S. Three.
36 years,

90
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:23,081
last three years
at medium pay.

91
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,916
That's...

92
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:26,952
That's 110,000 a year.

93
00:06:26,954 --> 00:06:29,020
<i>Hell, I'd retire for that much.</i>

94
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,094
I doubt that, sir.

95
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:44,436
I have skills
better deployed
in the field.

96
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:49,174
Ev, you have been
an inspiration to me.

97
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:51,143
<i>I'm not afraid to admit it.</i>

98
00:06:51,145 --> 00:06:52,878
<i>I'll look into it,</i>

99
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,414
see what I can do.

100
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,161
Come in.

101
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:13,565
- Milt.
- Wanna grab lunch?

102
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:15,100
Not today.

103
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:18,603
- How'd it go?
- Not so good.

104
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:21,606
Director said he's going
to see what he can do.

105
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:26,178
- You all right?
- Gotta tamper down,

106
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,213
get it under control.

107
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:30,549
Hey, put that dictionary
on my hand.

108
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:34,052
It's that book
over there, the orange one.
It's a dictionary.

109
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:37,454
I know what
a dictionary is.
Thank you.

110
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:41,860
There are two kinds

111
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:44,930
men of action
and everyone else.

112
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:50,215
I'll see you.

113
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:55,920
<i>Whoa whoa whoa whoa!</i>

114
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:57,355
<i>Stay!</i>

115
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,398
Yes?

116
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,400
<i>Milton?</i>
- Yes.

117
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:45,103
<i>This is Bob Deacon at NSA.</i>

118
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:46,771
<i>A while back you put in a watch</i>

119
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:48,773
<i>for certain chemical compounds.</i>

120
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:51,142
This was
three years ago.

121
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:53,178
<i>You still interested in that?</i>

122
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,280
- I am.
-<i> Good,</i>
<i>something's come up.</i>

123
00:11:55,282 --> 00:11:57,716
Where can I find you?
I'm coming over.

124
00:11:57,718 --> 00:12:00,285
<i>- A couple of weeks ago
- that flash drive came</i>

125
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:01,986
<i>into the possession
of the Romanians.</i>

126
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:04,355
It was water-damaged...
The guy jumped off a bridge.

127
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:07,759
S.R.I. Had no luck,
so they asked us to take
a crack at it.

128
00:12:07,761 --> 00:12:11,796
On it we found porn,
islamic sermons,

129
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:14,132
angry birds
and medical reports.

130
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:18,503
We ran "decitabine"
and your request came up.

131
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:21,306
Who was
abdi abdikarim?

132
00:12:21,308 --> 00:12:22,874
Kenyan national.

133
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:24,375
We had some
old passport records.

134
00:12:24,377 --> 00:12:25,343
Other than that,
nothing.

135
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:27,812
S.R.I. Made inquiries...

136
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:30,048
But the Kenyans weren't
all that much help.

137
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,883
Can I have a copy
of the full document?

138
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:33,918
- There's over 50 pages.
- That's all right.

139
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,420
I'll take it
electronically.

140
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:45,263
<i>You know that the only thing</i>

141
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,966
standing between
me and reassignment
is your approval.

142
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:50,068
Mr. lake, what do you wish
to do when you return?

143
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,203
There is
unfinished business.

144
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:53,838
Well, that's what I wish
you would talk about.

145
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,907
Muhammad banir
is alive.

146
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:57,909
They say he's dead...
Everybody says...

147
00:12:57,911 --> 00:13:01,045
- Killed in the explosion.
- There was a body.

148
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:03,348
So what?
I didn't see any head.

149
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,850
I didn't see
banir's head.

150
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:09,554
If you wish to return
to work at the c.I.A...

151
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:11,523
- If I wish to return?
- <i>I would strongly suggest</i>

152
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:14,159
that you put the matter
of Muhammad banir behind you.

153
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,901
<i>Fuck!</i>

154
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,404
All the indications
pointed that direction,

155
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:28,173
but it wasn't
until the pet scan
was complete

156
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:29,908
- that we could be sure.

157
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:32,410
- No more memory tests?
- Just the opposite.

158
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:35,046
- Mental exercises are
shown to be effective...
- All right, what is it?

159
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:37,528
Eight years
and I'm dead?

160
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,584
Mr. ruchowski,

161
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:41,319
this is
not Alzheimer's.

162
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:43,955
For many years,
frontotemporal dementia

163
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:46,090
and Alzheimer's
were confused,

164
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:49,227
but frontotemporal dementia
is a separate disease.

165
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:51,496
It's better?

166
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:56,201
F.T.D. Is
much more aggressive.

167
00:13:56,203 --> 00:13:59,437
Much more?
How much more?

168
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:01,439
Did anyone come
with you today?

169
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:05,376
- No.
- Family is very important
in a situation like this.

170
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:07,078
I don't have
any brothers or sisters.

171
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,181
No children.
My work is my family.

172
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,952
This frontal... f.T.D.,

173
00:14:13,954 --> 00:14:16,321
is there anything I should
be on the lookout for?

174
00:14:16,323 --> 00:14:18,489
You will be subject
to overreactions

175
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:20,458
or inappropriate reactions,

176
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,127
blank spells.
Perhaps you've
noticed this already.

177
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:26,564
- Mood swings, unreliable
sensory perception.

178
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:29,434
"Unreliable
sensory perception."

179
00:14:29,436 --> 00:14:31,870
That's what
it's called.

180
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:34,472
<i>There are support groups,</i>

181
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:36,341
<i>social services here
in Philadelphia...</i>

182
00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:38,183
<i>In fact, wherever you go.</i>

183
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:41,045
<i>I've spoken</i>
<i>with Dr. gross,</i>
<i>Nathan gross,</i>

184
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,580
<i>in the special care wing.</i>

185
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:44,582
<i>Now after we're finished,
you'll pay him a visit.</i>

186
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:46,618
<i>He's expecting you.</i>

187
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,287
<i>There's no reason
to be alone in this.</i>

188
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,668
<i>So what is prescribed?</i>

189
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,536
<i>Usually serotonin inhibitors...</i>

190
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:08,940
<i>Zoloft, Paxil...
Or antidepressants.</i>

191
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:11,643
<i>- But those are drugs
- for crazy people,</i>

192
00:15:11,645 --> 00:15:13,678
<i>manic-depressives.
That's not me.</i>

193
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,247
<i>Okay, let's get that clear.
That's not who I am.</i>

194
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,049
<i>Look, these medications</i>

195
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:20,151
<i>address the behavioral symptoms.</i>

196
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:22,954
<i>- Not the disease?
- That's correct.</i>

197
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:03,227
Hey.
Have you seen lake?

198
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:05,196
He hasn't
been here all day.

199
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:07,231
Do you know where he is?
Did he call in?

200
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:09,167
I'm busy, sir.
Sorry.

201
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:34,659
- Yeah?
<i>- Evan, where are you?</i>

202
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:37,581
<i>I've been</i>
<i>trying to reach you.</i>
<i>I left messages.</i>

203
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,364
I've been busy.

204
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:41,733
- <i> Something's come up.</i>
- What?

205
00:16:41,735 --> 00:16:43,668
<i>I don't wanna talk about it
over an open line.</i>

206
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,004
<i>Where are you?
I'll come meet you.</i>

207
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,374
<i>Evan, where are you?</i>

208
00:16:49,376 --> 00:16:50,641
Diamond Tuesdays.

209
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:53,111
<i>You're at Ruby Tuesdays?</i>

210
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:55,780
Yes, I'm at Ruby Tuesdays.
That's what I just said.

211
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:58,516
<i>Okay, which one?</i>

212
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,084
The one in...

213
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:03,721
Arlington.

214
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:21,039
- Ev.
- Yeah?

215
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:27,278
Get this man something
to eat, please,

216
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,614
- and a cup of coffee.
<i>- You got it.</i>

217
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:36,788
<i>Can I clear that for you?</i>

218
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,556
Hey.

219
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:42,093
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

220
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:50,974
That wasn't
very sociable.

221
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:52,770
What's going on?

222
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:54,806
Nothing.

223
00:17:54,808 --> 00:17:56,574
Do you want
to talk about it?

224
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,709
What is
so goddamn important?

225
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:01,746
This "something"
that has come up.

226
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:06,250
There's been
a possible hit on banir.

227
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:10,721
Over the last year,
five requests for deferiprone

228
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:13,724
- which is not too unusual...
- No, it doesn't affect
the anemia.

229
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:15,226
It's just
the iron deficiency.

230
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:16,861
Right, but the same source...

231
00:18:16,863 --> 00:18:19,130
The man
requesting it was Kenyan,

232
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:22,333
but the doctor
is in Bucharest
university hospital,

233
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,402
a research hospital.

234
00:18:24,404 --> 00:18:27,138
Decitabine
and azacitidine,

235
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,207
which are only used
for clinical trials...

236
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:31,843
- Mediterranean anemia.
- Thalassemia,

237
00:18:31,845 --> 00:18:33,811
which is hereditary,
which we know

238
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:35,413
Muhammad banir carries,

239
00:18:35,415 --> 00:18:37,748
even though he has
been dead for 20 years.

240
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,617
You know
his father died of it.

241
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,853
And abdikarim,
the man procuring the drug,

242
00:18:41,855 --> 00:18:45,356
was a suspect
in a Nigerian fraud ring.

243
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:46,724
<i>Rather than give himself up,</i>

244
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:48,793
he jumps off a bridge.

245
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:53,297
Medical info was
on a flash drive.

246
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:56,200
<i>He ain't no Kenyan.</i>
- He was 100% healthy.

247
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:58,903
- He had no need
for the medication.
- What else?

248
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:02,240
- Nothing.
- I knew he didn't die.

249
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:05,610
This means his condition has
moved to an advanced stage.

250
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:08,146
Now he can lay low,
he can become invisible,

251
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:11,668
but sooner or later
the disease will
flush him out.

252
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:13,918
Banir's got it.

253
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,888
It's come out.

254
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:19,490
It's in his blood.

255
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,941
Hmm?

256
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:17,548
Mbui!

257
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:33,931
Sorry to impose
on our relationship.

258
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:36,867
- What is it?
- I've come across intelligence

259
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:39,389
which leads me to believe
Muhammad banir is alive.

260
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,373
Give us the room,
gentlemen.

261
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:53,818
- - Go on.

262
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,721
Banir was believed killed
during my extraction.

263
00:20:56,723 --> 00:20:58,356
<i>The evidence was circumstantial.</i>

264
00:20:58,358 --> 00:20:59,991
Intelligence intercepts
led the agency

265
00:20:59,993 --> 00:21:01,492
to conclude
banir was dead.

266
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:02,860
<i>He disappeared from our radar.</i>

267
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:04,629
The c.I.A. Closed
the books on him.

268
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:07,498
Not a word about him has
been heard for 22 years...
Until now.

269
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,034
Banir has a hereditary
blood disease...

270
00:21:10,036 --> 00:21:13,004
Thalassemia.
If not apparent
during childhood,

271
00:21:13,006 --> 00:21:14,872
it can lay dormant
until midlife or later.

272
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:17,441
There have been
recent intercepts
of requests

273
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:21,412
for medicine used primarily
during clinical trials
for this anemia.

274
00:21:21,414 --> 00:21:24,882
These requests have
a Kenyan source.

275
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:29,520
And what's the source
of these intercepts?

276
00:21:29,522 --> 00:21:31,389
The source
is confidential.

277
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:34,959
Lake, I am the director
of the fucking agency.

278
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:38,429
Nothing is confidential.
Who's the source?

279
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:41,999
If the source were
to become known,

280
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:44,802
- the source
would be in danger.
- What do you propose?

281
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:46,604
I would like to set up
a task force,

282
00:21:46,606 --> 00:21:48,873
establish
banir's whereabouts,
extract him,

283
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,941
and have him return
to the United States
for trial.

284
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:53,077
<i>You'd</i> like to set up
a task force?

285
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:56,847
- I meant the agency, sir.
- Why don't we just
let the man die?

286
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:59,950
That is assuming that
your confidential source
is correct,

287
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:02,086
and assuming that
it does in fact indicate

288
00:22:02,088 --> 00:22:04,689
the presence of a man
that no one's heard of
in 22 years.

289
00:22:04,691 --> 00:22:06,991
Because it is not
the policy of this agency,

290
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:08,659
nor is it the policy
of this government,

291
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:10,695
to allow the man
who's responsible

292
00:22:10,697 --> 00:22:13,998
for at least 17 kidnappings,
a dozen executions

293
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,766
and the bombing
of a tourist bus...

294
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:18,035
Some of whom
were children,
by the way...

295
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:20,971
To go free
simply because he's sick.

296
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,414
Mary, sent in sanjar.

297
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:34,819
<i>Come in.</i>

298
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:38,522
This is Dr. sanjar.

299
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:40,825
He's with the office
of medical services.

300
00:22:40,827 --> 00:22:43,060
<i>Please, Evan, sit.</i>

301
00:22:43,062 --> 00:22:46,831
<i>Dr. sanjar was speaking
at upenn hospital...</i>

302
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:49,700
A conference
on service-related diseases.

303
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:53,471
Did you really think
you could travel 150 miles,

304
00:22:53,473 --> 00:22:55,973
<i>make three visits
to a neurological clinic</i>

305
00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:57,575
<i>under a false identity,</i>

306
00:22:57,577 --> 00:22:59,443
<i>give blood, leave fingerprints</i>

307
00:22:59,445 --> 00:23:01,445
<i>and not have us
find out about it?</i>

308
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:05,483
Dr. clayborne forwarded
your medical records.

309
00:23:05,485 --> 00:23:10,020
You don't have to worry
about payment or privacy
or quality of care.

310
00:23:10,022 --> 00:23:11,956
<i>The c.I.A. Takes care
of its own.</i>

311
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:14,458
<i>- The o.M.S. Has
- a state-of-the-art facility.</i>

312
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,160
In addition to which,
we coordinate our efforts

313
00:23:16,162 --> 00:23:18,062
with a.F.R.H. Here
in Washington.

314
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:21,165
And we'd like
to make this as easy
as possible for you.

315
00:23:21,167 --> 00:23:22,833
We've been speaking
to the d.D.O.

316
00:23:22,835 --> 00:23:24,869
We'll have
a retirement dinner.

317
00:23:24,871 --> 00:23:26,570
<i>The press...
Everyone'll come</i>

318
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:28,072
<i>heck, even the president
will be there.</i>

319
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:31,876
Banir.
What about banir?

320
00:23:31,878 --> 00:23:34,111
Muhammad banir
is dead, lake.

321
00:23:34,113 --> 00:23:36,414
- <i> Has been for 22 years.</i>

322
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:39,049
We interviewed
your departmental associates.

323
00:23:39,051 --> 00:23:41,952
We are concerned
about these mood swings
you've been suffering,

324
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:43,854
<i>the unpredictability
of behavior.</i>

325
00:23:43,856 --> 00:23:46,090
Banir, damn it.

326
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,527
There is a concern
that you could become

327
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:51,162
a liability
to the agency.

328
00:23:51,164 --> 00:23:53,564
- Fuck you.
<i>- Calm down.</i>

329
00:23:53,566 --> 00:23:56,133
I'm a liability?
You fucked this up

330
00:23:56,135 --> 00:23:58,602
just like you fucked up
everything else.

331
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:01,472
Fucked up Iran-contra,
fucked up ames,

332
00:24:01,474 --> 00:24:03,207
fucked up 9/11,
fucked up w.M.D.,

333
00:24:03,209 --> 00:24:05,209
Afghanistan,
Iraq, benghazi.

334
00:24:05,211 --> 00:24:07,211
Not you yourself
of course, no.

335
00:24:07,213 --> 00:24:10,080
<i>No, you're just the latest
in a long line of fuck-ups</i>

336
00:24:10,082 --> 00:24:11,682
who turned this agency
into a cesspool

337
00:24:11,684 --> 00:24:13,484
of politics
and special interests

338
00:24:13,486 --> 00:24:16,120
on behalf of the weapons makers
and the surveillance industry,

339
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:17,888
who get richer
while we get weaker!

340
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,824
- Mr. lake.
- I could...

341
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:25,863
I've forgotten
more about this agency
than you'll ever know.

342
00:24:25,865 --> 00:24:27,998
Who put you up
to this, huh?

343
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,968
Whose got their hand
in your pocket now?

344
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,070
I've seen
a million people like you.

345
00:24:33,072 --> 00:24:34,939
A million people.

346
00:24:34,941 --> 00:24:37,141
You've got your head
so far up Obama's ass,

347
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:39,543
you can't see anything
except his shit anymore.

348
00:24:39,545 --> 00:24:41,111
Shame on you.

349
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,081
Shame on you.

350
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,890
- Agent lake?
- Yes.

351
00:24:52,892 --> 00:24:55,960
The director's
asked us to collect
your security badge.

352
00:24:55,962 --> 00:24:57,242
Please stand, sir.

353
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:02,967
<i>Sir, we've been instructed</i>

354
00:25:02,969 --> 00:25:04,602
<i>to escort you
out of the facility.</i>

355
00:25:04,604 --> 00:25:06,604
<i>- Place the items
- you would like to take</i>

356
00:25:06,606 --> 00:25:09,006
<i>here on the desk
for inspection, sir.</i>

357
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:11,575
You want to check
my aftershave?

358
00:25:11,577 --> 00:25:13,143
<i>- There's no need
- to be snippy, sir.</i>

359
00:25:13,145 --> 00:25:15,279
You want my life?
You want my files?

360
00:25:15,281 --> 00:25:17,581
Here, take them!
Would you like awards?

361
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:19,149
Here. Here's a couple
of them for you.

362
00:25:19,151 --> 00:25:21,552
This is what they give
to assholes like me

363
00:25:21,554 --> 00:25:23,654
- who give their lives
for their country!

364
00:25:23,656 --> 00:25:25,523
Core values!

365
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:30,227
Get someone else to give
your goddamn lecture!

366
00:25:30,229 --> 00:25:31,695
I resign!

367
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:09,733
I have your stuff.
I... I hope you don't mind.

368
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:11,268
I didn't want
to leave it there.

369
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,771
Can I come in?

370
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:16,874
Yeah, come in.

371
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:19,643
Thanks.

372
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,255
You... you want
something to drink?

373
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:33,357
What are you having?

374
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:35,626
- Sake.
- Sounds good.

375
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:50,908
I screwed up
pretty bad today, huh?

376
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:53,177
No going back.

377
00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:55,946
So much for
the retirement party.

378
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:59,149
- They're not gonna
do nothing about banir.

379
00:26:59,151 --> 00:27:02,831
They treated me
like I was some
sort of crackpot.

380
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:07,291
<i>- Kanpai.
- Kanpai.</i>

381
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:09,293
Have a seat.

382
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,201
That's the other
reason I came.

383
00:27:17,203 --> 00:27:21,639
N.S.A. Forwarded a copy
of abdi's flash drive.

384
00:27:21,641 --> 00:27:23,374
The prescribing physician

385
00:27:23,376 --> 00:27:26,877
is Dr. iulian cornel,
medical research.

386
00:27:26,879 --> 00:27:28,412
That's why none
of the indicators went off.

387
00:27:28,414 --> 00:27:31,815
- How long has
this been happening?
- Two years.

388
00:27:33,653 --> 00:27:35,986
- Banir...
- Well...

389
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:40,658
Possible banir uses
abdikarim as a middleman.

390
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:44,261
Their communications,
any information about
possible banir...

391
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:46,430
Goes into the river...

392
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:49,266
Or so he thinks.

393
00:27:49,268 --> 00:27:53,771
And abdi pays Dr. cornel.

394
00:27:58,743 --> 00:27:59,743
Evan.

395
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:08,719
Ignorant...
Ignorant doctor in this?

396
00:28:09,754 --> 00:28:11,755
Well, except for one thing.

397
00:28:11,757 --> 00:28:14,191
Dr. cornel has
a Kenyan wife.

398
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:16,226
Ah.

399
00:28:16,228 --> 00:28:17,928
How much does he charge?

400
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:20,397
10k euro every month.

401
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:21,932
- And doesn't report it.
- Nope.

402
00:28:21,934 --> 00:28:23,934
Now we're
on the same page.

403
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:27,456
The doctor's
protecting himself.
You got the files?

404
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:29,873
- <i> You know what?</i>
- What?

405
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:32,176
This is cool.

406
00:28:32,178 --> 00:28:34,378
Print 'em out.
I don't like to read
off a monitor.

407
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,380
All right.

408
00:28:43,923 --> 00:28:45,889
No answer?

409
00:28:50,763 --> 00:28:52,362
Aasim.

410
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:07,144
Aasim.
Aasim. Aasim.

411
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,252
- You have a visa?
- Mm-hmm.

412
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:17,921
- Speak English?
- Yeah.

413
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:21,191
I need you to go...
Go to Bucharest.

414
00:29:21,193 --> 00:29:24,328
I need you to find
this... doctor.

415
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:26,463
I need you to get
the medication, hmm?

416
00:29:26,465 --> 00:29:28,365
Mmm.

417
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:33,537
Shave your beard
and get...

418
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:36,540
European ways.

419
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,518
Better idea.

420
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:53,891
Get this cornel
to come here.

421
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:58,495
What if...
If he give me
problems?

422
00:29:58,497 --> 00:30:00,564
If he does not
want to come?

423
00:30:00,566 --> 00:30:04,268
Tell him the family
of his wife

424
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,435
will not be spared.

425
00:30:05,437 --> 00:30:08,138
Yeah, that's good.
That's good.

426
00:30:12,845 --> 00:30:14,978
Here he is.

427
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:19,416
"Dr. iulian cornel,

428
00:30:19,418 --> 00:30:23,554
Grant to develop novel
b-thalassemia.

429
00:30:23,556 --> 00:30:27,057
Cooley's anemia foundation."

430
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:29,560
Bingo.
Muhammad banir,

431
00:30:29,562 --> 00:30:31,562
you think
you can hide?

432
00:30:31,564 --> 00:30:34,498
Nobody can hide
from the reaper.

433
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:38,202
Can we get in?

434
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,405
- Into what?
- <i> Into the correspondence</i>

435
00:30:41,407 --> 00:30:42,840
<i>between banir and the doctor.</i>

436
00:30:42,842 --> 00:30:45,375
Cornel hasn't heard
from abdi...

437
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:48,078
So now he's wondering...

438
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,847
"Where's my payment?"

439
00:30:50,982 --> 00:30:54,618
- It... it's possible, but...
- But what?

440
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:58,488
If this med
is for banir,

441
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:01,158
why hasn't anyone heard
from him in 20 years?

442
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,327
I can explain.

443
00:31:03,329 --> 00:31:07,431
Banir thought
I had an asset
in his group, a double.

444
00:31:07,433 --> 00:31:09,900
That's what he was trying
to get me to give up.

445
00:31:09,902 --> 00:31:11,635
There was
no fucking asset.

446
00:31:11,637 --> 00:31:13,470
I couldn't give it up
even if I wanted,

447
00:31:13,472 --> 00:31:14,638
but that was the deal.

448
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:18,508
After my extraction,
I had my doubts,

449
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:22,546
so I sent some intelligence
hinting that banir himself
was the double,

450
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:25,515
a cable that
would be intercepted
at the highest levels.

451
00:31:25,517 --> 00:31:27,150
<i>If he was still alive,</i>

452
00:31:27,152 --> 00:31:29,453
<i>i wanted him off
the playing field.</i>

453
00:31:29,455 --> 00:31:31,889
I drove him
into the ground.

454
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:36,126
Everybody figured
he was dead.

455
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,363
- I had my doubts.
- Why?

456
00:31:39,365 --> 00:31:41,965
Because he's
a true believer.

457
00:31:41,967 --> 00:31:43,567
Guys like that
don't just die.

458
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:47,237
You gotta... you gotta
rip out their hearts
with your bare hands.

459
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:50,574
You've been giving this
a lot of thought,
haven't you?

460
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:53,143
- <i> Just once a day.</i>
- Every day.

461
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:55,445
- All day long.

462
00:32:00,686 --> 00:32:02,386
Don't answer it.

463
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:14,431
Shit.
Uh, just stay there.

464
00:32:17,568 --> 00:32:19,703
Dr. sanjar,
I'm real busy right now.

465
00:32:19,705 --> 00:32:21,605
- I don't have the time.
<i>- Evan, I don't want</i>

466
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:24,274
<i>to leave it the way</i>
<i>it was left today.</i>
<i>It was not right.</i>

467
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:26,276
<i>- It's all right.
- No, it's not.</i>

468
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:29,079
I'm not going to let you
push this aside.

469
00:32:29,081 --> 00:32:31,715
We want to help you.
Come to my office,

470
00:32:31,717 --> 00:32:34,685
we'll sit down, have a talk,
prepare for the future.

471
00:32:34,687 --> 00:32:37,554
<i>It doesn't have</i>
<i>to be tomorrow.</i>
<i>Whenever you like.</i>

472
00:32:37,556 --> 00:32:41,725
- Agreed?
- Yeah. Agreed.

473
00:32:41,727 --> 00:32:45,062
- I'll see you then.
- I'll see you then.

474
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:49,700
You gonna tell me
what that was about?

475
00:32:49,702 --> 00:32:51,468
It's nothing.
Let's get drunk.

476
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:54,705
This goes back
to when I found you
at Ruby Tuesdays,

477
00:32:54,707 --> 00:32:57,674
- doesn't it?
- Can't a man have
any privacy?

478
00:32:57,676 --> 00:33:00,744
All right, look,
I'm risking my job here,

479
00:33:00,746 --> 00:33:02,713
but you've got
another program running,

480
00:33:02,715 --> 00:33:05,282
something you won't
tell me about.

481
00:33:05,284 --> 00:33:08,552
You gotta be straight.
You owe me that much.

482
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:27,304
Happy?

483
00:33:30,476 --> 00:33:32,009
It's not so bad now...

484
00:33:32,011 --> 00:33:34,211
Little things,
things that I can hide...

485
00:33:34,213 --> 00:33:38,448
But that's a train
that only runs one way.

486
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:40,717
Everything up here?

487
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:43,253
Rotting.
Bit by bit,

488
00:33:43,255 --> 00:33:45,088
<i>it slips away.</i>

489
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:48,025
- You've known this...
- <i> I suspected.</i>

490
00:33:48,027 --> 00:33:50,694
About a year ago,
something in my head just...

491
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:52,496
Fell.

492
00:33:52,498 --> 00:33:54,631
By the time you start
showing symptoms,

493
00:33:54,633 --> 00:33:56,299
the atrophy's
done its damage,

494
00:33:56,301 --> 00:33:57,768
brain mass
has decreased.

495
00:33:57,770 --> 00:33:59,736
Three years, my guess.
That's about it.

496
00:33:59,738 --> 00:34:02,806
You know,
I wanna know something.
Were they asking about me?

497
00:34:02,808 --> 00:34:07,377
Uh, not to me directly,
but yeah.

498
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:09,746
- You're angry?
- Not at them.

499
00:34:09,748 --> 00:34:12,482
Well, actually,
maybe at them,
but this whole damn thing.

500
00:34:12,484 --> 00:34:14,785
Why me?
Why the fuck me?

501
00:34:14,787 --> 00:34:18,588
- I didn't do anything wrong!
- Ev, you still have time left.

502
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:21,725
Make the most of it.

503
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:26,196
Why waste it
looking for someone
who may not even exist?

504
00:34:26,198 --> 00:34:28,698
He does exist.

505
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,805
There is a window here.

506
00:34:34,807 --> 00:34:38,608
It won't be open long,
and then it will close

507
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,677
and banir will have
gotten away with it.

508
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:44,848
And I am gonna do something
worth remembering

509
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:47,084
with what's left of my time.

510
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:26,323
- Could you
please step out?

511
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:31,862
Mr. lake, we're going
back to the station.

512
00:35:31,864 --> 00:35:34,731
Please get in the patrol car.
I will drive you there.

513
00:35:34,733 --> 00:35:36,800
Place your keys
under the seat.

514
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:40,203
- - What have I done?

515
00:35:40,205 --> 00:35:43,340
State law requires
physicians to report

516
00:35:43,342 --> 00:35:46,443
<i>all conditions that</i>
<i>might cause a loss</i>
<i>of consciousness, Mr. lake.</i>

517
00:35:46,445 --> 00:35:48,211
<i>Your name is on this list.</i>

518
00:35:48,213 --> 00:35:50,847
<i>Now if this is an error,</i>
<i>it will be corrected</i>
<i>at the station.</i>

519
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:53,650
<i>- Look, I work for
- the United States government,</i>

520
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:56,586
- <i> just like you.</i>
<i>Another officer</i>
<i>will bring your car.</i>

521
00:35:56,588 --> 00:35:59,623
<i>If there's someone you'd</i>
<i>like to pick you up, you can</i>
<i>call them from the station.</i>

522
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:01,925
<i>If you have a cellphone,
you can call now.</i>

523
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:08,165
What made him jump,
the Kenyan?

524
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:11,468
All right, he's a conduit
for pharmaceuticals.

525
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:14,471
He's been
protecting the location
of someone presumed dead.

526
00:36:14,473 --> 00:36:17,874
<i>He's been accused</i>
<i>of this Nigerian</i>
<i>drug fraud scam.</i>

527
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:20,577
What makes him jump?

528
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:23,547
It had to be
something else.

529
00:36:23,549 --> 00:36:25,916
Something he knew.
Something he was afraid
he'd give up.

530
00:36:25,918 --> 00:36:27,817
Yeah, something scary.

531
00:36:27,819 --> 00:36:30,487
The money came in.

532
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:34,791
10,000 Euros,
abdi's account.

533
00:36:34,793 --> 00:36:36,893
And no one to pick it up.
Shit, I gotta hurry.

534
00:36:36,895 --> 00:36:38,662
The clock's running.

535
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,865
You're going to Romania?

536
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:44,935
How? Have you
thought about how
you're gonna do it?

537
00:36:44,937 --> 00:36:46,803
Go to Bucharest,
collect the money,

538
00:36:46,805 --> 00:36:48,805
track down the bad guy,
charter a jet,

539
00:36:48,807 --> 00:36:50,840
set her down
at Andrew's air force base.

540
00:36:50,842 --> 00:36:52,909
No, not in detail.

541
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:57,314
- I'm coming with you.
- No, you're not.

542
00:36:57,316 --> 00:37:00,483
- Let me come with you.
- I'm not helpless.

543
00:37:00,485 --> 00:37:02,485
I know, but do you have
multiple I.D.?

544
00:37:02,487 --> 00:37:04,854
- I have old passport...
- Old passport won't cut
a deal like this,

545
00:37:04,856 --> 00:37:06,456
<i>not in today's security.</i>

546
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:09,726
We'll need
at least three sets,
all vetted.

547
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:12,562
- How long for the I.D.S?
- Two days, three.

548
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:13,863
- What if I say no?
- No what?

549
00:37:13,865 --> 00:37:15,732
- No, you can't come.

550
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:18,635
Well then,
Mr. secret agent man,

551
00:37:18,637 --> 00:37:21,471
I might have
to drop a dime on you.

552
00:37:22,874 --> 00:37:24,708
You know,
I half believe you would.

553
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:40,690
It's programmed
to the number I was given.

554
00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:43,260
Only call
if it's an emergency.

555
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:45,495
You have cash?

556
00:37:45,497 --> 00:37:46,963
Yes.

557
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:50,752
So this will be
your car.

558
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:54,938
- Do you have...
- Don't tell me anything.

559
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,606
I know nothing.

560
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:00,977
Do you have a gun?

561
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:03,192
In the trunk.

562
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:14,457
Have you clarified
your plan?

563
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:17,560
There's a woman
meeting us in Bucharest.

564
00:38:17,562 --> 00:38:20,964
Oh. You are
full of surprises.

565
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:22,732
Michelle zubarain,

566
00:38:22,734 --> 00:38:24,334
used to be a journalist,

567
00:38:24,336 --> 00:38:25,835
mid-east danger junkie.

568
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,938
Might even have
been an agent.

569
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:31,441
She works
out of Prague now.

570
00:38:31,443 --> 00:38:34,978
- She an old flame?
- Just someone I used to know.

571
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:40,784
- And?
- Just, you know,
one step at a time.

572
00:38:40,786 --> 00:38:43,486
Seeing what'll
happen next.

573
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:58,768
Professor
Dr. iulian cornel.

574
00:39:00,472 --> 00:39:02,839
Nothing particularly
stands out about him.

575
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:06,443
Keeps a low profile,
community service,

576
00:39:06,445 --> 00:39:08,411
sits on a couple
of boards.

577
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:11,481
What about his wife?

578
00:39:11,483 --> 00:39:14,117
Angena?
They met through
an aid program.

579
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:16,653
- Where?
- Mombasa.

580
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,824
- Sir.
- What?

581
00:39:20,826 --> 00:39:22,359
This is
a nonsmoking section.

582
00:39:22,361 --> 00:39:24,761
Let me just
check something.

583
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:28,665
Yup, I am in Romania.

584
00:39:28,667 --> 00:39:30,467
Are you out
of your fucking mind?

585
00:39:30,469 --> 00:39:32,769
This whole country
is a smoking section.

586
00:39:32,771 --> 00:39:35,939
- Evan.
- Okay. Okay.

587
00:39:35,941 --> 00:39:37,807
Sir, there is
a smoking area upstairs.

588
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:39,442
I'm putting it out!

589
00:39:39,444 --> 00:39:41,611
Jesus!

590
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:45,573
Thank you
for bringing that
to our attention.

591
00:39:46,817 --> 00:39:48,985
I know.
I'm sorry, Michelle.

592
00:39:48,987 --> 00:39:50,587
I'm sorry about that.
It's the jetlag.

593
00:39:50,589 --> 00:39:53,089
It's got me...
It's got me turned around.

594
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:59,162
- It's all right.
- What's the best way
to approach Dr. cornel?

595
00:39:59,164 --> 00:40:01,398
In his office
during business hours,

596
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,566
closed door,
with colleagues nearby.

597
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:05,535
I've prepared
an official cover.

598
00:40:05,537 --> 00:40:07,737
You'll be
my American colleagues.

599
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:09,105
Okay.

600
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:19,482
How did you
and Michelle meet?

601
00:40:19,484 --> 00:40:22,051
<i>If I'm not being too forward.</i>

602
00:40:22,053 --> 00:40:24,020
No, it's not
too forward. It just...

603
00:40:24,022 --> 00:40:26,856
Wasn't particularly
glamorous.

604
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:32,128
How did you and Evan meet?
That's more interesting.

605
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,067
I was a...

606
00:40:38,069 --> 00:40:41,604
Non-official
covert op in Cairo.

607
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:44,707
And I lost an asset...

608
00:40:44,709 --> 00:40:46,776
The son
of a cabinet minister.

609
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:49,846
My fuck-up.
Ugly political situation.

610
00:40:49,848 --> 00:40:52,115
<i>The agency just stepped back.</i>

611
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:54,918
Then Evan lake showed up.

612
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,587
Two days later,
I was on a plane
back to Washington.

613
00:40:57,589 --> 00:41:01,558
They just
needed to be reminded
we take care of our own.

614
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:06,229
I was a believer then.

615
00:41:06,231 --> 00:41:09,132
You still have it,
don't you?

616
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:11,868
- What?
- You know what
I'm talking about.

617
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:16,539
Show him, Evan.

618
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:23,847
Yeah, I caught a bullet
when I was extracted.

619
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:28,251
He offered once to have
that bullet put in a ring...

620
00:41:28,253 --> 00:41:30,687
If I'd agree to wear it
on my finger.

621
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:34,123
I bet you didn't know
he was such a romantic.

622
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:41,264
I've gotta get back
to the room.

623
00:41:41,266 --> 00:41:43,666
This flight really
took it out of me.

624
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:52,008
I'll see you later.

625
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:56,980
Did you
have to say that?

626
00:41:58,115 --> 00:42:01,618
- Did I embarrass you?
- You couldn't embarrass me.

627
00:42:48,265 --> 00:42:50,233
Everybody set?

628
00:43:10,854 --> 00:43:13,022
That's him in the glasses.

629
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:21,297
- Dr. cornel?
- <i> Da.</i>

630
00:43:36,715 --> 00:43:39,115
- M-my office, please.
- <i> Da.</i>

631
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:42,752
Decitabine is not
a prohibited drug,

632
00:43:42,754 --> 00:43:45,388
- so I don't see why...
- Dr. cornel, I'm here
as a liaison.

633
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:47,724
This request has come
through official channels.

634
00:43:47,726 --> 00:43:49,726
It originates
from Washington, D.C.

635
00:43:49,728 --> 00:43:53,229
Washington?

636
00:43:53,231 --> 00:43:56,699
- English, please.
- We have an interest
in this person,

637
00:43:56,701 --> 00:43:58,668
abdi abdikarim.

638
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:01,337
What kind of a name
is that anyway?

639
00:44:01,339 --> 00:44:04,173
He said
he was Kenyan.

640
00:44:04,175 --> 00:44:08,244
- What's your connection to him?
- I only met him once
at a coffee shop.

641
00:44:08,246 --> 00:44:11,047
- The rest was
through the mails.
- When was that?

642
00:44:11,049 --> 00:44:14,283
- Two years ago.
- You've been prescribing
a rare, potent drug

643
00:44:14,285 --> 00:44:17,420
to somebody you met once
in a coffee shop
two years ago?

644
00:44:17,422 --> 00:44:19,022
He had medical records.

645
00:44:19,024 --> 00:44:20,757
He was representing
someone else,

646
00:44:20,759 --> 00:44:22,792
but the name
had been redacted.

647
00:44:22,794 --> 00:44:25,395
You have no knowledge
of who's actually
using this drug?

648
00:44:25,397 --> 00:44:27,330
None whatsoever,
but I did nothing wrong.

649
00:44:27,332 --> 00:44:29,298
- I did everything by the book.

650
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:32,235
20,000 Euros
every two months.

651
00:44:32,237 --> 00:44:34,303
Does that sound
about right?

652
00:44:47,951 --> 00:44:51,454
And why should that be
a security concern?

653
00:44:52,456 --> 00:44:54,424
- Cornish...

654
00:44:54,426 --> 00:44:56,325
Cornish...

655
00:44:57,695 --> 00:44:59,095
Cornish.

656
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,198
Cornel.

657
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,867
Dr. Julian cornel,

658
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:08,738
let us decide
what is or isn't
a security concern.

659
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:10,940
Arrest him.

660
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:15,011
Dr. cornel,
could you please stand up.

661
00:45:15,013 --> 00:45:16,345
- What?

662
00:45:16,347 --> 00:45:18,314
- Turn around.

663
00:45:18,316 --> 00:45:20,950
No no no,
I can't be arrested.
I cannot be arrested.

664
00:45:20,952 --> 00:45:22,952
- You don't understand.
- Tell it to your lawyer.

665
00:45:22,954 --> 00:45:26,456
He came into my home last night.
My wife was terrified.

666
00:45:26,458 --> 00:45:28,424
- Who?
<i>He didn't</i>
<i>give his name.</i>

667
00:45:28,426 --> 00:45:31,060
He said abdi was dead.
He was an arab.

668
00:45:31,062 --> 00:45:33,296
He wanted the decitabine

669
00:45:33,298 --> 00:45:35,364
and wanted me
to go to the patient.

670
00:45:35,366 --> 00:45:36,366
- Where?
- Didn't say.

671
00:45:36,367 --> 00:45:38,167
Why are you still here?

672
00:45:38,169 --> 00:45:40,403
- Uh...
- You asked
for more money, didn't you?

673
00:45:41,338 --> 00:45:43,906
- How much?
- 30,000.

674
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:46,008
You're a successful doctor.

675
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:47,877
You're going
somewhere you don't know

676
00:45:47,879 --> 00:45:49,779
to treat someone
you don't know

677
00:45:49,781 --> 00:45:53,516
for a lousy 30,000 Euros.
What am I missing here?

678
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:56,252
Well...

679
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,357
It's my wife.

680
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,494
She's from Kenya.

681
00:46:05,395 --> 00:46:07,296
They said
they'll kill her family

682
00:46:07,298 --> 00:46:10,166
- if I didn't come.
- The arab man who
told you this,

683
00:46:10,168 --> 00:46:12,502
is he planning
on traveling with you?

684
00:46:14,204 --> 00:46:15,772
I assume so.

685
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:19,442
You think cornel
will contact us when
they call him?

686
00:46:19,444 --> 00:46:21,778
Yeah, he'll call.
We've got him scared now.

687
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:23,479
We're his only chance.

688
00:46:23,481 --> 00:46:26,482
Is there really
a Natalie negrescu
at s.R.I.?

689
00:46:26,484 --> 00:46:29,886
He's not gonna contact
the Romanian authorities.

690
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:48,805
Get this cornel.

691
00:46:48,807 --> 00:46:52,542
He...
He is a crook.

692
00:46:52,544 --> 00:46:56,078
30,000. Who does
he think he is, eh?

693
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:59,415
I wouldn't trust him
if he wasn't.

694
00:47:01,553 --> 00:47:06,088
He only wants
15,000 now, so...

695
00:47:07,558 --> 00:47:08,958
He has to come.

696
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,459
Can we get
that much money?

697
00:47:10,461 --> 00:47:12,929
I will write the details.

698
00:47:12,931 --> 00:47:16,899
You... you go send it
from the Internet cafe.

699
00:47:16,901 --> 00:47:19,001
<i>It will take at least...</i>

700
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:22,505
At least a day,
but first we'll ask
for more time.

701
00:47:22,507 --> 00:47:25,541
You tell him... no.
No, I...

702
00:47:25,543 --> 00:47:28,511
I don't have time.

703
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:36,853
- <i>- Evan.</i>

704
00:47:41,558 --> 00:47:42,959
Evan.

705
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:56,232
- - 31.

706
00:48:59,002 --> 00:49:00,937
<i>44.</i>

707
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,241
<i>31.</i>

708
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,444
<i>35.</i>

709
00:49:09,413 --> 00:49:11,981
<i>Fuck. 24.</i>

710
00:49:15,319 --> 00:49:16,619
17.

711
00:49:19,222 --> 00:49:20,990
10.

712
00:49:21,558 --> 00:49:23,292
Three.

713
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:32,701
Are you...

714
00:49:35,105 --> 00:49:37,006
You warm enough?

715
00:49:41,044 --> 00:49:43,212
I asked you to tell me

716
00:49:43,214 --> 00:49:45,181
if you were going out.

717
00:49:46,116 --> 00:49:47,683
<i>I got anxious,</i>

718
00:49:47,685 --> 00:49:49,485
kept walking.

719
00:49:51,221 --> 00:49:53,122
But the thing was I...

720
00:49:53,124 --> 00:49:57,460
I-I... I couldn't remember
the name of the hotel.

721
00:50:01,732 --> 00:50:04,633
You left your wallet.

722
00:50:14,644 --> 00:50:17,079
It's just
three blocks over.

723
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:22,685
You get some sleep.

724
00:50:23,653 --> 00:50:26,022
You'll be fine.

725
00:50:27,124 --> 00:50:29,258
It happens towards
the end of the day.

726
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:31,627
Sundowning
it's called.

727
00:50:31,629 --> 00:50:34,330
Nobody knows why.

728
00:50:34,332 --> 00:50:37,266
You get anxious,
confused.

729
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:39,668
I had to get out,

730
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:41,337
go somewhere.

731
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:45,508
You take your medication?

732
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:51,347
Do you feel better?

733
00:50:51,349 --> 00:50:52,748
Yeah.

734
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:54,650
Yeah, I just slipped.

735
00:50:55,585 --> 00:50:58,821
Lost track.
I'm... I'm all right.

736
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:03,259
Dr. cornel called.

737
00:51:04,661 --> 00:51:06,729
The money will
arrive tomorrow.

738
00:51:06,731 --> 00:51:09,765
They said to be ready
to travel in a few days,

739
00:51:09,767 --> 00:51:12,087
had to get him
a Kenyan visa.

740
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:15,704
Banir's arab friend?

741
00:51:15,706 --> 00:51:17,073
Yeah.

742
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:24,513
Do you remember...
What he looked like?

743
00:51:25,449 --> 00:51:27,650
- Who?
- Banir.

744
00:51:27,652 --> 00:51:31,320
Of course.
I can see him now.

745
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:35,724
Back then
when you were...

746
00:51:35,726 --> 00:51:36,859
A captive,

747
00:51:36,861 --> 00:51:40,529
<i>banir wanted a name, right?</i>

748
00:51:40,531 --> 00:51:42,765
Why didn't you
give him a name?

749
00:51:42,767 --> 00:51:46,202
<i>It didn't matter
which name, any name.</i>

750
00:51:46,204 --> 00:51:49,438
It just...
Pissed him off more,

751
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,873
hurt the man's pride.

752
00:51:52,209 --> 00:51:54,543
<i>If you'd have given him a name,</i>

753
00:51:54,545 --> 00:51:57,113
he probably
would've said, "good"...

754
00:51:57,848 --> 00:51:59,715
And let you go.

755
00:51:59,717 --> 00:52:01,750
I didn't want
to be the man

756
00:52:01,752 --> 00:52:04,120
who gave up a name
under questioning.

757
00:52:10,827 --> 00:52:12,895
Come on,
hotel's this way.

758
00:52:12,897 --> 00:52:14,630
Let's go.
It's gonna start snowing.

759
00:52:14,632 --> 00:52:16,432
I know where
the damn hotel is.

760
00:52:16,434 --> 00:52:18,534
Stop trying to put
a bib on me, okay?

761
00:52:18,536 --> 00:52:20,469
Okay.

762
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,187
It's a quarter past.

763
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:42,892
<i>- Okay, he's got
- the money.</i>

764
00:53:18,261 --> 00:53:19,862
<i>Shit, he's seen us.</i>

765
00:53:31,841 --> 00:53:33,409
<i>Oof!</i>

766
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:08,677
Hey!

767
00:54:09,646 --> 00:54:11,380
The airplane ticket
and the money.

768
00:54:11,382 --> 00:54:12,615
Okay.

769
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:18,387
- And the passport.
- Just give me a second.

770
00:54:18,389 --> 00:54:21,290
You are out of this.
You dodged a bullet.

771
00:54:21,292 --> 00:54:24,026
Nothing's gonna happen
to you or your people.

772
00:54:24,861 --> 00:54:26,862
Now you can go.

773
00:55:30,593 --> 00:55:32,094
Any word from aasim?

774
00:55:32,096 --> 00:55:34,763
The doctor will arrive
on Wednesday.

775
00:55:35,799 --> 00:55:38,100
After that...
Nothing?

776
00:55:38,102 --> 00:55:39,735
Not yet.

777
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,373
No no. No no.

778
00:55:45,542 --> 00:55:47,776
Just a few more moments.

779
00:55:59,456 --> 00:56:01,090
What was
his phone number again?

780
00:56:02,659 --> 00:56:07,096
254-41-834-5571.

781
00:56:08,064 --> 00:56:09,465
Where is that?

782
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:18,841
- Mombasa.
- The asshole
of east Africa.

783
00:56:18,843 --> 00:56:21,977
That's exactly where someone
like banir would end up.

784
00:56:21,979 --> 00:56:24,780
That's where cornel
will meet with banir.

785
00:56:24,782 --> 00:56:27,383
- When?
- Tuesday.

786
00:56:28,918 --> 00:56:30,953
We gotta make banir
think this...

787
00:56:30,955 --> 00:56:33,055
- What was his name?
- Aasim.

788
00:56:33,057 --> 00:56:34,656
Is still alive.

789
00:56:34,658 --> 00:56:36,925
Well, all the messages
are texts,

790
00:56:36,927 --> 00:56:39,061
so we can text.

791
00:56:42,932 --> 00:56:44,566
Yeah, Michelle?

792
00:56:44,568 --> 00:56:47,603
Yeah, me too.

793
00:56:47,605 --> 00:56:50,139
Look, milt needs
a Kenyan visa.

794
00:56:51,441 --> 00:56:53,041
As soon as possible.

795
00:56:53,043 --> 00:56:55,110
And there's another thing.

796
00:56:56,546 --> 00:56:58,447
After the base
is down,

797
00:56:58,449 --> 00:57:01,984
just tone it down
a little with a cotton ball.

798
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:05,053
Are you
taking this down?

799
00:57:05,055 --> 00:57:07,556
All right,
this whole process

800
00:57:07,558 --> 00:57:10,058
should take
about two hours
for the first time

801
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:13,529
and will last the better part
of a shooting day.

802
00:57:13,531 --> 00:57:17,132
Serban works
on motion pictures when
he isn't helping us out.

803
00:57:17,134 --> 00:57:21,069
So if you feel insecure
or need a little bit
of an ego boost,

804
00:57:21,071 --> 00:57:23,105
serban is
the man for you.

805
00:57:23,107 --> 00:57:25,607
The world is
not a pretty place
without makeup.

806
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:27,142
Hmm.

807
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:32,714
The eye color
is pretty different.

808
00:57:32,716 --> 00:57:36,585
No. No,
I don't want contacts.

809
00:57:38,488 --> 00:57:41,690
Fortunately,
our man wears glasses,

810
00:57:41,692 --> 00:57:45,127
so I've added
a little tint to these.

811
00:57:51,935 --> 00:57:55,137
Dr. iulian cornel.

812
00:57:55,139 --> 00:57:58,173
I was able to expedite
your Kenyan visa.

813
00:57:59,209 --> 00:58:02,478
Serban. What exactly
did you see?

814
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,179
I didn't see anything.

815
00:58:07,218 --> 00:58:08,784
Thank you.

816
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:15,724
Your visa.

817
00:58:15,726 --> 00:58:17,793
You might want to keep it
to yourself for a day.

818
00:58:17,795 --> 00:58:20,596
- Why?
- Give Evan another day

819
00:58:20,598 --> 00:58:23,078
to think about
what he's doing.

820
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:26,034
He's been thinking
about it for 20 years.

821
00:58:27,103 --> 00:58:28,183
22.

822
00:58:33,543 --> 00:58:35,244
Evan has retired.

823
00:58:35,246 --> 00:58:37,679
It's his life,
his choice, but you...

824
00:58:37,681 --> 00:58:40,782
No matter how this turns out,
it will end badly for you.

825
00:58:40,784 --> 00:58:43,118
Your career will be over.

826
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:46,221
All my life,
I wanted to be
in the foreign service.

827
00:58:46,223 --> 00:58:49,658
It was killing me,
being strapped to a desk.

828
00:58:50,994 --> 00:58:54,096
- You should tell him.
- I tried.

829
00:58:55,164 --> 00:58:56,932
He's made his choice.

830
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:40,876
<i>- What's his name?</i>

831
00:59:40,878 --> 00:59:42,210
<i>What is the name?</i>

832
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:47,649
<i>You want to...</i>

833
01:00:18,247 --> 01:00:20,716
Michelle had to run.

834
01:00:20,718 --> 01:00:23,285
She was able
to get my visa.
I have it.

835
01:00:23,287 --> 01:00:27,255
I was watching TV.
Something about a body
on university campus.

836
01:00:27,257 --> 01:00:31,293
Let's pack up,
go to a hotel near
the airport,

837
01:00:31,295 --> 01:00:34,229
stay in the room
until the flight leaves.

838
01:00:34,231 --> 01:00:38,200
Just before the flight,
text banir from aasim's phone,

839
01:00:38,202 --> 01:00:41,236
aasim says he's been
detained by security.

840
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:45,374
What about Michelle?

841
01:00:45,376 --> 01:00:47,743
Are you gonna
tell Michelle?

842
01:00:47,745 --> 01:00:49,645
What did she ask?

843
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:52,748
Did she say
anything about me?

844
01:00:54,784 --> 01:00:58,820
- No.
- Don't tell her
how the story ends.

845
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:08,030
<i>Flight 418 now boarding</i>

846
01:01:08,032 --> 01:01:09,398
<i>at gate seven.</i>

847
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,335
<i>Flight 418 now boarding</i>

848
01:01:13,337 --> 01:01:15,137
<i>at gate seven.</i>

849
01:01:45,735 --> 01:01:47,436
I am Dr. cornel.

850
01:01:49,739 --> 01:01:50,906
- Dr. cornel.
- Yes.

851
01:01:50,908 --> 01:01:52,340
- Julian cornel?
- Yes.

852
01:01:52,342 --> 01:01:54,342
I am mbui.
So glad you could come.

853
01:01:54,344 --> 01:01:56,445
I'll take you
to Dr. wangari's office.

854
01:01:56,447 --> 01:01:58,714
Where is aasim?

855
01:01:59,449 --> 01:02:01,416
He is coming.

856
01:02:01,418 --> 01:02:04,086
<i>Flight 273 now arriving.</i>

857
01:02:19,836 --> 01:02:23,238
When did Mr. Ali hariri
have his last transfusion?

858
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:25,040
Three days ago.

859
01:02:25,042 --> 01:02:26,742
When is he scheduled
for another?

860
01:02:26,744 --> 01:02:28,510
- Three days.

861
01:02:28,512 --> 01:02:30,078
Here at the clinic?

862
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:34,349
Saeed Ali hariri

863
01:02:34,351 --> 01:02:36,318
is being treated
at his own residence.

864
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:39,488
- I will see him here.
- Dr. cornel,

865
01:02:39,490 --> 01:02:41,490
you were given letter
with all explained.

866
01:02:41,492 --> 01:02:46,027
- We wrote this.
- I am just double checking.

867
01:02:46,029 --> 01:02:48,830
Al-hariri is not able
to leave his residence.

868
01:02:48,832 --> 01:02:51,500
You requested
additional payment
in the light of this.

869
01:02:51,502 --> 01:02:54,436
Of course.
Let me go through
everything tonight.

870
01:02:54,438 --> 01:02:55,937
These are for me,
correct?

871
01:02:55,939 --> 01:02:57,773
Then tomorrow I will visit

872
01:02:57,775 --> 01:03:00,542
Mr. Ali hariri
at his residence.

873
01:03:00,544 --> 01:03:04,479
- Will you be coming, doctor?
- Dr. wangari will not
be able to join us.

874
01:03:04,481 --> 01:03:07,883
I'll pick you up
at the hotel, 4:00 P.M.

875
01:03:19,996 --> 01:03:23,532
All right, I'll give you
750 for the Jericho,

876
01:03:23,534 --> 01:03:26,334
- 900 for the glock.
- No no no no no no.

877
01:03:26,336 --> 01:03:28,403
- 1150 for the glock.
- 1150?

878
01:03:28,405 --> 01:03:29,905
- Yeah.
- Okay, just stop.

879
01:03:29,907 --> 01:03:32,541
Here's what we do.
900... 900 for the Jericho...

880
01:03:32,543 --> 01:03:34,209
- No no no no no.
- 950 for the glock.

881
01:03:34,211 --> 01:03:35,544
All right?
No, that's fair.

882
01:03:35,546 --> 01:03:37,146
No no no no,
it's not fair,
it's not fair.

883
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:48,990
Mbui.

884
01:03:48,992 --> 01:03:52,427
Come come.

885
01:03:52,429 --> 01:03:55,430
Come come.

886
01:03:55,432 --> 01:03:57,165
Closer closer closer.

887
01:03:59,403 --> 01:04:00,569
- Shh.

888
01:04:02,972 --> 01:04:05,440
Aasim is missing.

889
01:04:05,442 --> 01:04:07,375
<i>Abdi is dead.</i>

890
01:04:07,377 --> 01:04:10,011
If there is
a traitor among us,
I will find him.

891
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:12,581
Is it you?
Is it you?

892
01:04:14,852 --> 01:04:16,251
800, 900.

893
01:04:16,253 --> 01:04:17,452
- No.
- No? All right, look,

894
01:04:17,454 --> 01:04:19,254
this is
2,000 Euros right here.

895
01:04:19,256 --> 01:04:21,323
2,000 Euros
right here, okay?

896
01:04:21,325 --> 01:04:24,492
Don't underestimate me.

897
01:04:24,494 --> 01:04:28,563
I have survived
much more than this.

898
01:04:28,565 --> 01:04:31,600
I went shopping
at the market.

899
01:04:31,602 --> 01:04:34,002
A Jericho 941...

900
01:04:34,004 --> 01:04:36,471
And a glock.

901
01:04:38,942 --> 01:04:41,343
- How much?

902
01:04:43,512 --> 01:04:45,313
2,000 Euros.

903
01:04:46,482 --> 01:04:48,483
You got took.

904
01:04:48,485 --> 01:04:52,888
Well, we've got Euros
to spare.

905
01:04:52,890 --> 01:04:54,589
Do you smell something?

906
01:04:54,591 --> 01:04:57,392
- - Mombasa.

907
01:04:58,494 --> 01:05:02,230
The other night when
we were in the park
in Bucharest,

908
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:04,032
I touched your jacket.

909
01:05:04,034 --> 01:05:05,600
You were wearing this...

910
01:05:05,602 --> 01:05:09,004
This blue,
like canvas jacket,

911
01:05:09,006 --> 01:05:10,405
but when I touched it,

912
01:05:10,407 --> 01:05:12,941
it... it felt
just like dog fur.

913
01:05:14,510 --> 01:05:17,612
Isn't it strange when
you can't even trust
your own fingers?

914
01:05:17,614 --> 01:05:20,248
And don't ask me
how I feel.

915
01:05:21,183 --> 01:05:22,984
I wouldn't think of it.

916
01:05:22,986 --> 01:05:24,586
- - Crock.

917
01:05:27,556 --> 01:05:29,324
Evan.

918
01:05:29,326 --> 01:05:32,327
- Crock is... gun.

919
01:05:32,329 --> 01:05:35,563
No way I'll be able to bring
a gun with me tomorrow.

920
01:05:35,565 --> 01:05:37,565
Mbui frisked me today.

921
01:05:37,567 --> 01:05:38,967
He'll frisk me
again tomorrow.

922
01:05:40,002 --> 01:05:41,603
Well, how do you
plan to do it?

923
01:05:42,705 --> 01:05:45,407
It's been so long,
thought about it so long,

924
01:05:45,409 --> 01:05:46,574
I'm not sure.

925
01:05:46,576 --> 01:05:49,945
Maybe I'll just let
the moment guide me.

926
01:05:50,546 --> 01:05:52,647
I've got a syringe
and medication.

927
01:05:52,649 --> 01:05:54,416
One's quick and painless,

928
01:05:54,418 --> 01:05:56,117
the other's
a strychnine derivative...

929
01:05:56,119 --> 01:05:58,086
Excruciating,
takes over an hour.

930
01:05:58,088 --> 01:06:00,689
Or maybe I'll just
get up close to him,

931
01:06:00,691 --> 01:06:03,224
slice him
and let his blood
wash all over me.

932
01:06:03,226 --> 01:06:08,363
I don't feel comfortable
letting you go in there alone.

933
01:06:08,365 --> 01:06:12,200
- I'll be all right.
- Look, I... I picked
this up at the market.

934
01:06:12,202 --> 01:06:14,569
They're wireless crazy
over here.

935
01:06:14,571 --> 01:06:18,139
Jumped straight
from tom-Toms
to cellphones.

936
01:06:18,141 --> 01:06:20,241
Just tuck that
in somewhere,

937
01:06:20,243 --> 01:06:23,144
I'll be able to hear you
and I'll get g.P.S. As well.

938
01:06:23,146 --> 01:06:25,347
I brought a belt blade.

939
01:06:25,349 --> 01:06:27,983
I'll be able
to get that through,
but that's about it.

940
01:06:32,722 --> 01:06:35,090
- So that's that then?
- Yeah.

941
01:06:36,258 --> 01:06:37,459
Milt...

942
01:06:38,394 --> 01:06:40,362
Thanks for coming along.

943
01:06:40,364 --> 01:06:42,884
No problem,
old sport.

944
01:07:14,597 --> 01:07:16,531
If I'm not out in an hour,

945
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:18,166
do whatever you want.

946
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:44,259
Please.

947
01:07:46,729 --> 01:07:49,097
- Did you sleep well?
- All right.

948
01:07:49,099 --> 01:07:51,459
Sometimes the heat
is a problem.

949
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:56,204
Come, doctor.

950
01:08:04,647 --> 01:08:06,381
Open the briefcase.

951
01:09:06,542 --> 01:09:08,409
Dr. cornel.

952
01:09:08,411 --> 01:09:10,211
<i>Salaam alaikum.</i>

953
01:09:10,213 --> 01:09:12,747
<i>Salaam alaikum,</i>
saeed Ali hariri.

954
01:09:12,749 --> 01:09:15,917
Dr. cornel,
thank you.

955
01:09:15,919 --> 01:09:17,785
Thank you
for coming.

956
01:09:17,787 --> 01:09:19,787
Forgive me
for not...

957
01:09:20,723 --> 01:09:22,557
Standing.

958
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:25,793
Mbui, some tea.

959
01:09:27,597 --> 01:09:29,831
And those...
Those dates.

960
01:09:29,833 --> 01:09:31,900
Mind if I sit?

961
01:09:31,902 --> 01:09:33,835
Oh, please.

962
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:40,775
Dr. wangari has
provided me your records,

963
01:09:40,777 --> 01:09:42,710
your treatment history.

964
01:09:42,712 --> 01:09:45,813
Last night I was
in contact with several
of my colleagues.

965
01:09:45,815 --> 01:09:47,849
Thank you.

966
01:09:50,352 --> 01:09:52,787
I noticed
you were scheduled
three months ago

967
01:09:52,789 --> 01:09:54,789
<i>for a bone marrow transplant,</i>

968
01:09:54,791 --> 01:09:56,658
but I found no record
of the procedure.

969
01:09:56,660 --> 01:09:58,660
<i>Was there a problem
with the donor?</i>

970
01:09:58,662 --> 01:10:03,231
- It was too dangerous.
- Uh, no sibling donor
was possible,

971
01:10:03,233 --> 01:10:05,600
no compatible cousins.

972
01:10:05,602 --> 01:10:09,804
It is risky,
but an unrelated donor

973
01:10:09,806 --> 01:10:13,908
can be found based on h.L.B.
And d.R. Histocompatibility.

974
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:21,783
The university hospital
can assist in finding
such a donor.

975
01:10:21,785 --> 01:10:23,865
We have
a large database.

976
01:10:24,987 --> 01:10:26,921
Should have
been done before.

977
01:10:26,923 --> 01:10:28,656
It is more...

978
01:10:28,658 --> 01:10:31,726
Dangerous now,
but we have no choice.

979
01:10:31,728 --> 01:10:33,962
At present,
transplantation is

980
01:10:33,964 --> 01:10:36,731
the only possible
curative therapy.

981
01:10:37,933 --> 01:10:42,003
And...
It can be done here?

982
01:10:42,005 --> 01:10:43,905
Yes.

983
01:10:47,776 --> 01:10:50,712
Excuse me,
I am not such a young man.

984
01:10:50,714 --> 01:10:52,680
Where is the toilet?

985
01:10:52,682 --> 01:10:55,416
Back and to the left.

986
01:10:55,418 --> 01:10:56,851
So sorry.

987
01:10:56,853 --> 01:10:58,786
Oh, please. Please.

988
01:11:25,981 --> 01:11:28,983
There is a problem
with the toilet.

989
01:11:28,985 --> 01:11:31,452
Mmm. Mbui.

990
01:11:37,493 --> 01:11:38,993
It won't flush.

991
01:11:38,995 --> 01:11:42,330
- You pulled the chain?
- I pulled the chain.

992
01:11:43,365 --> 01:11:47,335
There is something stuck...
In there.

993
01:12:20,369 --> 01:12:22,437
I have to be honest.

994
01:12:24,773 --> 01:12:28,109
Your condition is
far worse than I imagined.

995
01:12:32,548 --> 01:12:34,882
Your long-term chances
for survival

996
01:12:34,884 --> 01:12:36,451
are not good.

997
01:12:39,488 --> 01:12:41,656
Neither are
your short-term chances.

998
01:12:46,762 --> 01:12:48,996
In fact, they are
quite hopeless.

999
01:12:52,468 --> 01:12:54,068
It's because I'm not a doctor.

1000
01:12:59,475 --> 01:13:03,411
My name isn't
Julian cornel...

1001
01:13:04,513 --> 01:13:07,148
And your name
isn't Ali hariri.

1002
01:13:08,417 --> 01:13:09,617
Your name...

1003
01:13:09,619 --> 01:13:11,819
Is Muhammad banir.

1004
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:26,734
Mr. ruchowski.

1005
01:13:28,605 --> 01:13:30,138
Evan lake.

1006
01:13:34,109 --> 01:13:36,978
- Mbui?
- He'll be all right.

1007
01:13:39,114 --> 01:13:40,882
Where is your backup?

1008
01:13:40,884 --> 01:13:43,751
Hmm?
Your elite commandos.

1009
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:47,655
Oh. You came alone.

1010
01:13:54,062 --> 01:13:56,097
How did you find me?

1011
01:13:56,099 --> 01:13:58,466
Through the request
for experimental

1012
01:13:58,468 --> 01:14:01,169
thalassemia medication,
decitabine.

1013
01:14:02,171 --> 01:14:04,038
Your family
medical history.

1014
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:05,907
<i>It was you.</i>

1015
01:14:05,909 --> 01:14:10,678
Hmm?
You who sent me
into hiding.

1016
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:13,080
<i>Even so for years and years</i>

1017
01:14:13,082 --> 01:14:16,217
I live in rooms
like this one.

1018
01:14:18,086 --> 01:14:21,222
I would have gladly
given both my ears
for my freedom.

1019
01:14:24,761 --> 01:14:27,228
So my health...

1020
01:14:28,664 --> 01:14:30,898
- Is it really hopeless?
- Yes.

1021
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:33,835
You would've died of anemia
just like your father.

1022
01:14:38,707 --> 01:14:41,108
<i>He was an intellectual scholar.</i>

1023
01:14:42,110 --> 01:14:45,780
I... I've read
quite a bit myself.

1024
01:14:48,151 --> 01:14:50,618
- Yeah.

1025
01:14:52,221 --> 01:14:54,822
So...

1026
01:14:57,227 --> 01:14:58,693
How are...

1027
01:14:59,828 --> 01:15:01,829
How are you going
to kill me?

1028
01:15:03,198 --> 01:15:05,566
- I-I... I don't know.

1029
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:09,237
<i>Good.</i>

1030
01:15:09,239 --> 01:15:12,106
<i>Ah. So...</i>

1031
01:15:14,277 --> 01:15:16,277
<i>We have some time.</i>

1032
01:15:17,246 --> 01:15:18,980
Perhaps we can have that...

1033
01:15:19,948 --> 01:15:22,116
Conversation that
I wanted to have

1034
01:15:22,118 --> 01:15:24,685
that time years a-ago.

1035
01:15:24,687 --> 01:15:26,087
Huh?

1036
01:15:27,055 --> 01:15:28,556
You... you only
kept giving me

1037
01:15:28,558 --> 01:15:29,857
your fake name. Why?

1038
01:15:31,293 --> 01:15:34,529
- I was making a point.
- What point?

1039
01:15:36,632 --> 01:15:38,599
<i>What is it that you do now?</i>

1040
01:15:39,801 --> 01:15:41,135
This company?

1041
01:15:41,137 --> 01:15:44,839
Intelligence analyst, yes?

1042
01:15:44,841 --> 01:15:47,708
Perhaps you've read
some of my writings?

1043
01:15:52,281 --> 01:15:54,549
- I didn't know
you were still active.

1044
01:15:54,551 --> 01:15:57,885
- <i> Oh, I-I-I, uh... I contribute.</i>

1045
01:15:57,887 --> 01:16:00,821
<i>A number of web sites
not under my name.</i>

1046
01:16:00,823 --> 01:16:04,859
<i>Of course, you are
religious man, Mr. lake?</i>

1047
01:16:04,861 --> 01:16:07,728
No, I'm not religious.

1048
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:09,163
<i>I think you are.</i>

1049
01:16:09,165 --> 01:16:11,732
America, yeah?

1050
01:16:11,734 --> 01:16:13,634
You see yourself
as a religion... America.

1051
01:16:13,636 --> 01:16:15,202
I've written about this,

1052
01:16:15,204 --> 01:16:17,238
the American way of life.

1053
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:18,839
Huh?

1054
01:16:18,841 --> 01:16:20,708
Have you been
to greeley, Colorado?

1055
01:16:20,710 --> 01:16:23,911
- You know what
I'm talking about?
- Sayyid qutb...

1056
01:16:23,913 --> 01:16:25,246
Who went from Cairo

1057
01:16:25,248 --> 01:16:28,215
to Colorado
state college in 1948.

1058
01:16:28,217 --> 01:16:31,152
He said greeley was
like paradise on earth.

1059
01:16:31,154 --> 01:16:36,057
What qutb saw
was<i> jahiliyyah,</i> huh?

1060
01:16:36,059 --> 01:16:39,160
Decadence,
promiscuity, pop music.

1061
01:16:39,162 --> 01:16:41,202
"Baby,
it's cold outside."

1062
01:16:45,033 --> 01:16:47,969
Qutb was repulsed.

1063
01:16:47,971 --> 01:16:50,204
<i>The-the... the flirting</i>

1064
01:16:50,206 --> 01:16:52,707
and the mixing
of men and women,

1065
01:16:52,709 --> 01:16:54,976
the disrespect...
So no, he left.

1066
01:16:54,978 --> 01:16:59,246
Went back to Egypt
and the movement was born.

1067
01:16:59,248 --> 01:17:01,616
- - The Muslim brotherhood.

1068
01:17:04,220 --> 01:17:05,953
My father knew him.

1069
01:17:05,955 --> 01:17:08,723
No, nasser...

1070
01:17:08,725 --> 01:17:10,324
Nasser executed him.

1071
01:17:11,259 --> 01:17:13,361
It was too late.

1072
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:20,401
45. 38.

1073
01:17:20,403 --> 01:17:22,303
It was too late.

1074
01:17:23,805 --> 01:17:25,806
Fundamentalism,

1075
01:17:25,808 --> 01:17:28,809
- Mr. lake,
of the prophet...
- 170.

1076
01:17:28,811 --> 01:17:31,045
- Was social justice!
- 38.

1077
01:17:31,047 --> 01:17:33,648
Better schools,
better jobs,

1078
01:17:33,650 --> 01:17:35,416
Mr. lake.

1079
01:17:36,351 --> 01:17:38,653
This doesn't just...
Just end.

1080
01:17:39,988 --> 01:17:43,090
Are you still
a believer?

1081
01:17:43,092 --> 01:17:45,292
<i>Hmm?
Do you still believe?</i>

1082
01:17:46,695 --> 01:17:48,229
I don't.

1083
01:17:48,231 --> 01:17:50,131
<i>My faith, it was...</i>

1084
01:17:50,133 --> 01:17:52,733
It was taken from me.

1085
01:17:52,735 --> 01:17:56,270
You think I'm playing games
with you, Mr. lake?

1086
01:17:56,272 --> 01:17:58,105
<i>Huh?</i>

1087
01:17:58,107 --> 01:18:00,941
You think
we are playing games?!

1088
01:18:00,943 --> 01:18:05,279
-<i> While mullahs,</i>
<i>ayatollahs, they get rich.</i>

- ..For spirit systems.

- Why? Hmm? Why?!
- <i> I'm Charles ruchowski.</i>

My name is

dangerous people

1101
01:18:39,882 --> 01:18:43,818
- do you think
it made any difference?

1102
01:18:44,953 --> 01:18:48,422
What you did! You!

1103
01:18:52,394 --> 01:18:54,729
Do you?

1104
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:01,402
<i>Now, what is the name</i>

1105
01:19:01,404 --> 01:19:03,838
of the source,
Mr. lake?!

1106
01:19:07,342 --> 01:19:10,911
Ah. You are sick too. Hmm?

1107
01:19:10,913 --> 01:19:12,913
<i>I see it, your face.</i>

1108
01:19:13,849 --> 01:19:16,209
You have a disease
of the blood.

1109
01:19:16,985 --> 01:19:19,320
My disease
is in the brain.

1110
01:19:19,322 --> 01:19:21,422
What sort of disease?

1111
01:19:22,958 --> 01:19:25,359
I'm forgetting things.

1112
01:19:25,361 --> 01:19:27,795
Ohhh.

1113
01:19:28,530 --> 01:19:30,798
There is
a lot to forget.

1114
01:19:37,472 --> 01:19:40,474
It's the time for prayer.

1115
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:47,481
Will you...
Please help me?

1116
01:19:47,483 --> 01:19:49,817
No, I won't do that!

1117
01:19:52,487 --> 01:19:54,255
So...

1118
01:19:57,459 --> 01:19:59,994
So what are you
going to do... to do?

1119
01:20:05,934 --> 01:20:07,902
I'm going to leave.

1120
01:20:07,904 --> 01:20:10,037
Just like that?

1121
01:20:10,039 --> 01:20:11,539
Just like that.

1122
01:20:14,409 --> 01:20:16,844
Ma'a salama.
- <i> Ma'a salama.</i>

1123
01:20:29,825 --> 01:20:31,025
<i>Evan.</i>

1124
01:20:38,934 --> 01:20:40,267
Milt.

1125
01:20:40,269 --> 01:20:42,269
What happened?

1126
01:20:47,843 --> 01:20:51,011
- Was it worth it?
- Yeah, it was worth it.

1127
01:20:52,113 --> 01:20:54,114
You should've
heard him scream.

1128
01:20:56,585 --> 01:20:58,152
Put the car in gear.

1129
01:21:11,466 --> 01:21:13,500
God, I hate
this time of day.

1130
01:21:13,502 --> 01:21:15,970
It's the worst.

1131
01:21:17,305 --> 01:21:19,306
You want to have
a drink?

1132
01:21:41,963 --> 01:21:44,465
Outside. Let's walk.

1133
01:21:46,601 --> 01:21:48,035
<i>Later on...</i>

1134
01:21:48,037 --> 01:21:49,637
You wanna
talk about it?

1135
01:21:49,639 --> 01:21:51,505
What are
you gonna do?

1136
01:21:51,507 --> 01:21:54,642
- Go home, I guess.
- So should you.

1137
01:21:54,644 --> 01:21:58,545
What home?
- Oh come on, don't
be melodramatic.

1138
01:21:58,547 --> 01:22:02,483
You'll retire.
You're young, there's tons
of things you could do.

1139
01:22:02,485 --> 01:22:04,685
Or don't retire.
They won't put it together...

1140
01:22:04,687 --> 01:22:07,288
Bucharest, mombasa.

1141
01:22:07,290 --> 01:22:10,057
- They won't want to.
- Nah.

1142
01:22:10,059 --> 01:22:11,659
It was always
my dream to...

1143
01:24:16,317 --> 01:24:18,519
<i>Salaam alaikum,</i> asshole.

1144
01:24:24,259 --> 01:24:27,561
That boy you shot
was my friend.

1145
01:24:32,401 --> 01:24:33,700
What the fuck
does that mean?

1146
01:24:33,702 --> 01:24:35,983
- Come closer.
Come on.
- Okay.

1147
01:26:16,671 --> 01:26:18,472
<i>- What the hell
- are you doing here?</i>

1148
01:26:20,676 --> 01:26:22,376
<i>Haven't you heard?</i>

1149
01:26:24,746 --> 01:26:27,848
<i>The c.I.A. Fell
from the Berlin wall</i>

1150
01:26:27,850 --> 01:26:31,351
<i>and all the president's men</i>
<i>can't put it back</i>
<i>together again!</i>

1151
01:26:32,954 --> 01:26:34,655
<i>It's broke!</i>

1152
01:26:34,657 --> 01:26:36,823
<i>Not reliable.
Not trustworthy.</i>

1153
01:26:36,825 --> 01:26:38,825
<i>Can't stand up
to the white house.</i>

1154
01:26:38,827 --> 01:26:40,727
<i>Backstabbers.</i>

1155
01:26:40,729 --> 01:26:43,730
<i>Watching porn, tapping phones.</i>

1156
01:26:43,732 --> 01:26:46,533
<i>Best and brightest
quit or retired.</i>

1157
01:26:47,702 --> 01:26:49,670
<i>What in the name of Jesus Christ</i>

1158
01:26:49,672 --> 01:26:51,572
<i>nailed to the cross</i>

1159
01:26:51,574 --> 01:26:53,307
<i>are you doing here?</i>

1160
01:26:57,979 --> 01:26:59,546
<i>Values.</i>

1161
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:04,218
<i>The c.I.A. Has
taken some hits,</i>

1162
01:27:04,220 --> 01:27:06,353
some deserved.

1163
01:27:06,355 --> 01:27:08,288
We've been down
on the canvas,

1164
01:27:08,290 --> 01:27:09,890
but we're
on our feet again,

1165
01:27:09,892 --> 01:27:11,525
because we've got
no choice

1166
01:27:11,527 --> 01:27:13,227
and because our country
needs us

1167
01:27:13,229 --> 01:27:15,295
and because
we've got what?

1168
01:27:17,632 --> 01:27:19,466
Values.
