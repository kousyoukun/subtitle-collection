It's because even babies love candy!

It's nice. And you're giving people

"Wow, there's a nice... There's...

631
00:31:03,946 --> 00:31:05,281
And a "thanks" would have been nice.

632
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:08,117
Maybe one day
you're gonna be thanking me.

633
00:31:12,663 --> 00:31:14,206
So, what do you want with Eric Sacks?

634
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:16,750
My dad used to work for him.

635
00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:17,960
He's the only person
that's gonna be able

636
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:19,795
to tell me whether or not I'm crazy.

637
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,130
Crazy about what?

638
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:22,214
I don't need you to laugh at me also.

639
00:31:22,298 --> 00:31:23,299
Oh, come on, O'Neil.

640
00:31:23,424 --> 00:31:27,887
This is the Fenwick Express,
it's a judgment-free zone.

641
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:29,221
A cocoon of safety.

642
00:31:29,305 --> 00:31:30,890
Promise?

643
00:31:31,015 --> 00:31:33,309
I'm insulted that
you would suggest otherwise.

644

(ENGINE STARTING)

645
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:41,567
Ooh, 11 hours in the Ha'shi.

646
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:44,320
Are you sure none of you want to tell me

647
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:47,114
where you were last night?

648
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:48,782
How you holding up, fellas?

649
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:52,661
Ah! I ain't breaking
if Donnie ain't breaking.

(WHIMPERING)

651
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,833

but not breaking.

Guys? I'm in the zone!

00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:09,720
There is literally nothing
that could break me right now!

655
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:12,264
Starting to break.

656
00:32:12,348 --> 00:32:15,809
Of course, you've all tasted
the five-cheese pizza.

657
00:32:16,352 --> 00:32:18,062
But this,

658
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:22,524
cheesemongers have speculated
of its existence for centuries.

659
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:25,527
Da Vinci's original masterpiece.

660
00:32:25,736 --> 00:32:28,030
I submit to you...

...the 99-cheese pizza.

00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:38,624
Oh!

664
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:40,751
It's not possible.

665
00:32:40,918 --> 00:32:42,169
Mikey, it's a trap!

666
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:45,172
A pizza with that variety of cheese
is a culinary impossibility!

667
00:32:45,255 --> 00:32:48,634
- Shall I list the ingredients?
-No.

668
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:50,177
- Cheddar...
-(STRAINING)

Taleggio...

673
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:57,768
(SOFTLY) I don't even know what that is.

674
00:32:57,893 --> 00:32:59,645
Mozzarella, of course.

675
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:02,189
All right, all right, all right!

676
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:04,400
We left the lair because the Foot
were taking hostages

677
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:05,776
and we kicked some serious butt,

678
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:07,486
and there was this girl
named April O'Neil

679
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:08,654
who took our picture,

680
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:09,822
(GASPING) but we took care of it.

681
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:11,407
RAPHAEL: Idiot.

682
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:15,494
Oh, no, my worst fears
have been realized.

683
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:17,496
Don't worry about it.
Donnie erased the picture!

684
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:18,747
We're not in danger.

685
00:33:18,831 --> 00:33:23,377
No. It's April O'Neil who is in danger!

686
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:26,422
Find the girl. Bring her here.

687
00:33:26,547 --> 00:33:27,965
But, sensei, you said to not go...

688
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:29,049
Find the girl!

689
00:33:29,133 --> 00:33:30,217
Find the girl.

690
00:33:36,265 --> 00:33:38,851
APRIL: That's what I told Thompson
and she fired me.

691
00:33:39,852 --> 00:33:42,604
So they're aliens?

692
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:45,107
No, that's stupid.

693
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,859
They're reptiles.

694
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:50,112
They help people, I guess.

695
00:33:51,822 --> 00:33:52,948
Heroes in the half-shell.

696
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:55,993
- Okay.
-Come on. It's not that crazy. I...

697

The animal kingdom is full of...

698
00:33:59,872 --> 00:34:01,665
I used to have a dog
that could moonwalk.

699
00:34:06,462 --> 00:34:09,131
- Thanks for the ride, Vern.
-Yeah. No problem.

-(CAR DOOR CLOSING)
-Nothing better than

701
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:13,719
dropping off a pretty girl
at a rich guy's house.

702
00:34:20,601 --> 00:34:22,102
(INTERCOM BEEPING)

703
00:34:22,311 --> 00:34:25,647
Hi, it's April O'Neil,
here to see Eric Sacks.

704
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:40,704
April's arrived early this year.

705
00:34:40,788 --> 00:34:42,206
I'm sorry to barge in on you
like this, Mr. Sacks.

706
00:34:42,331 --> 00:34:44,166
No, no, no. Please, please.

707
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:45,292
Thank you.

708
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:46,919
APRIL: I've been working on a story.

709
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:49,046
And I have this theory that
there are these vigilantes

710
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:51,006
that are fighting back against the Foot.

711
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:53,634
I think you and my father
may have created them.

712
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:56,678
Uh, I'm not sure I...

713
00:34:56,762 --> 00:34:58,680
Can you please tell me
everything that you know

714
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:00,557
about Project Renaissance?

715
00:35:03,811 --> 00:35:04,812
Hmm.

716
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:08,774
Well, um, it was a dream.

717
00:35:10,192 --> 00:35:11,944
A dream that died with your father.

718
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:13,320
What if it isn't dead?

719
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:15,322
That's impossible.

720
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:17,574
We lost all our research in the fire,

721
00:35:17,658 --> 00:35:20,577
all our specimens, everything.

722
00:35:20,661 --> 00:35:24,289
I've spent the last 15 years
trying to replicate the results.

723
00:35:24,373 --> 00:35:27,251
You didn't lose everything in the fire.

724
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,806
- This can't be real.
-it is real.

725
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:42,724
I saw all four of them.

726
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:47,062
Do you really want to know
about Project Renaissance?

727
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:49,523
- Yes.
-Come with me.

728
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:53,777
I was born in Japan,
at a military base in Okinawa.

729
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,822
My father went to Vietnam.

730
00:35:57,698 --> 00:35:59,366
Didn't come back.

731
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:01,910
I was an outsider in a foreign land.

732
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:04,496
A freak.

733
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:07,124
I was a powerless and helpless boy.

734
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:10,961
Until a local <i>sensei</i>
took me under his wing.

735
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:12,713
And he saved me.

736
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:15,257
Taught me lessons that I later
shared with your father.

737
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,926
Ninth-century Japan.

738
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:20,095
An evil warlord ruled the land.

739
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:24,183
He poisoned the water supply,
bringing on the dark ages.

740
00:36:24,266 --> 00:36:27,102
Death and disease
and suffering ran rampant.

741
00:36:27,186 --> 00:36:28,896
Not unlike the Foot Clan

742
00:36:28,979 --> 00:36:30,772
and what they'd like to do to our city.

743
00:36:30,898 --> 00:36:33,942
Then one day, a hero arose.

744
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:37,279
A great alchemist
discovered the antidote

745
00:36:37,404 --> 00:36:39,031
to the warlord's poison.

746
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:40,782
The cure-all

747
00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:43,118
for his evil.

748
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:46,121
Your father and I were trying
to recreate that cure-all.

749
00:36:46,246 --> 00:36:48,373
We developed a mutagen

750
00:36:48,457 --> 00:36:51,501
capable of stimulating self-repair

751
00:36:51,585 --> 00:36:53,545
on a cellular level.

752
00:36:54,922 --> 00:36:57,049
What were you going to do with it?

753
00:37:00,636 --> 00:37:02,638
Imagine New York City,

754
00:37:04,473 --> 00:37:06,225
being victim to a chemical attack.

755
00:37:06,308 --> 00:37:10,395
This mutagen would be able
to reverse its effects.

756
00:37:10,479 --> 00:37:12,940
It would save the city,
it would save the people.

757
00:37:13,023 --> 00:37:16,818
Those test subjects, those turtles...

758
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:22,115
Running in their blood
is the last of this precious mutagen.

759
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:24,701
And up until a few moments ago,

760
00:37:26,495 --> 00:37:28,372
I thought we failed.

761
00:37:28,497 --> 00:37:30,832
I thought they died in the fire. How...

762
00:37:32,084 --> 00:37:33,085
How could they have lived?

763
00:37:33,794 --> 00:37:36,338
Because I saved them.

764
00:37:37,673 --> 00:37:39,174
Of course you did.

765
00:37:40,342 --> 00:37:43,929
April, the mutagen possesses powers

766
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:49,184
beyond our wildest hopes.

767
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:51,687
Whatever resources you need,

768
00:37:52,688 --> 00:37:54,022
I'm here.

769
00:37:55,357 --> 00:37:56,692
Let's work together. We'll find them.

770
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:00,862
The course of human history
may depend on it.

771
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:03,865
I'll show you out.
