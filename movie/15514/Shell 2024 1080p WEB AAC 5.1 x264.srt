1
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,907
No, I can't.
I can't get them off.

2
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:51,579
No. No, they're everywhere.

3
00:01:53,681 --> 00:01:54,882
I can't.

4
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:00,822
No! Don't call the police.
I can't call anyone.

5
00:02:03,558 --> 00:02:04,759
Come and get me.

6
00:02:06,928 --> 00:02:08,395
No, I'm not.

7
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:11,633
I feel like you're not
listening to me.

8
00:02:46,134 --> 00:02:47,568
Hello?

9
00:02:57,645 --> 00:02:58,746
Hello?

10
00:03:03,051 --> 00:03:04,451
Anybody there?

11
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:12,292
I called 911.

12
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:15,863
They're on their way.

13
00:04:13,187 --> 00:04:14,522
Breaking news at this hour.

14
00:04:14,589 --> 00:04:16,691
Actress and activist
Jenna Janero

15
00:04:16,758 --> 00:04:19,594
is officially considered
a missing person.

16
00:04:19,794 --> 00:04:21,763
Neighbors heard
sounds of distress...

17
00:04:21,863 --> 00:04:24,464
Your kids want
something sweet for breakfast,

18
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:26,934
but you want to make sure
they stay healthy?

19
00:04:27,235 --> 00:04:31,338
Meet Gardner's Diet Bananas.
That same delicious taste,

20
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:33,440
only half the calories.

21
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,645
...now the CEO of the largest

22
00:04:37,712 --> 00:04:40,313
health and wellness
brand in America,

23
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,382
Zoe Shannon will be sitting down

24
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:45,219
with Sally Jones
to talk about Shell,

25
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,687
the company that promises

26
00:04:46,754 --> 00:04:49,223
to keep you looking
younger forever.

27
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,458
But coming up after the break,
self-driving cars

28
00:04:51,526 --> 00:04:54,262
are getting more Americans
to where they want to go,

29
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:56,731
but can they also
lead to cancer?

30
00:04:56,798 --> 00:04:57,932
That story and...

31
00:04:57,999 --> 00:05:00,101
We have arrived
at your destination.

32
00:05:00,168 --> 00:05:01,769
Have a safe day.

33
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:17,652
So, how did it go?

34
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:18,920
Oh, I'm just going in now.

35
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:20,788
Okay.
Clearly, studio movie,

36
00:05:20,855 --> 00:05:23,024
but they're really open
to a discovery here.

37
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,859
Director is excited to meet.

38
00:05:25,226 --> 00:05:26,294
Well,
I really feel like

39
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:27,662
I connect with
the character and...

40
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:29,297
- Love that.
- We believe in you, Sammy.

41
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:30,898
Okay, well,
I'm getting in the elevator,

42
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:32,800
- so I might lose you.
- Break a leg, kiddo.

43
00:05:32,867 --> 00:05:34,334
Bye. Bye.

44
00:05:59,594 --> 00:06:01,996
Holy shit. Samantha Lake?

45
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,866
Samantha. Hi.

46
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:09,203
Hi. Wow.

47
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:12,372
Oh, wait, um, it's...
It's Chloe.

48
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,875
Chloe, yes.
Yes.

49
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,910
Chloe Benson?
Right.

50
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:18,445
Redmount Road?

51
00:06:18,713 --> 00:06:21,349
Oh, my God, yes.
You used to babysit me.

52
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:23,150
Wow, oh... Yeah.

53
00:06:23,718 --> 00:06:25,385
Jesus, you got really, uh...

54
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:27,788
I mean, you're big
or grown-up.

55
00:06:27,855 --> 00:06:30,324
Well, it's been,
like, ten years.

56
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:31,525
Has it really been that long?

57
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:33,127
What are you doing here?

58
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:35,395
Wait, are you reading
for this, too?

59
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:36,664
That's crazy.
I'm not reading.

60
00:06:36,764 --> 00:06:38,699
- I'm meeting with the director.
- Oh, cool.

61
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:40,935
Mm-hmm.
What part
are you meeting for?

62
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:43,571
I didn't know you wanted
to be an actress.

63
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:45,907
Oh, I don't, really,
but my management

64
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:48,042
wants me to diversify
my social audience,

65
00:06:48,109 --> 00:06:50,711
so it's basically more
exploratory at this point.

66
00:06:51,112 --> 00:06:53,180
Wonderful.
Yeah.

67
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:54,782
Okay.

68
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:56,350
Samantha Lake?

69
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,519
That's you.
That's me.

70
00:06:58,819 --> 00:06:59,921
Break a leg.

71
00:07:00,655 --> 00:07:02,556
You, too.

72
00:07:02,857 --> 00:07:05,126
Can't wait to tell my folks
that we ran into each other.

73
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:06,527
They're gonna die.

74
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:08,729
Hey, guys.

75
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:11,799
Samantha. Yay, we love you.

76
00:07:11,866 --> 00:07:14,402
Aw, thank you. I love you, too.

77
00:07:14,602 --> 00:07:17,338
Well, we are up against it,

78
00:07:17,405 --> 00:07:19,807
so are you cool
to just dive right in?

79
00:07:21,676 --> 00:07:24,812
Oh, yeah, uh... Wow, okay.

80
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:28,783
Whoa. Sure.
Uh, is the director, um...

81
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:31,786
Oh, ultimately, he wasn't able

82
00:07:31,852 --> 00:07:33,321
to make it work
with his schedule,

83
00:07:33,387 --> 00:07:35,356
but he will be watching
everybody's tapes.

84
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:36,958
Oh, okay.

85
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:38,826
Yeah, I'm sorry. I just...

86
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:41,529
I'm so... I thought
this was just a meeting, so...

87
00:07:41,762 --> 00:07:45,199
My... That's what my agent said.
I wasn't, um, ready to read.

88
00:07:46,367 --> 00:07:47,601
Everybody's reading.

89
00:07:47,868 --> 00:07:49,804
- Everybody's reading. Right.
- Sam.

90
00:07:50,404 --> 00:07:51,405
Long time.

91
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:52,974
Yeah, it's good
to see you again.

92
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,276
Did you, uh, take a break?
'Cause I feel like

93
00:07:55,343 --> 00:07:56,711
I... I haven't seen you
in a minute.

94
00:07:57,044 --> 00:07:59,013
Yeah, no. No, no break.

95
00:07:59,847 --> 00:08:01,816
Okay,
should we get started?

96
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:04,218
Yeah.

97
00:08:04,285 --> 00:08:06,921
Take this off,
just to get comfortable.

98
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:10,691
Just... Okay.

99
00:08:11,258 --> 00:08:12,293
Um...

100
00:08:13,427 --> 00:08:15,696
- In my own time?
- Whenever you're ready.

101
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,268
I wanted to be noticed.

102
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:24,271
I'd wanted it for so long.

103
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:27,708
I was really willing
to do anything.

104
00:08:28,409 --> 00:08:30,644
And to be anyone, just...

105
00:08:31,746 --> 00:08:33,581
just have another person
look at me.

106
00:08:34,382 --> 00:08:38,219
Really look at me and think
that I was funny or...

107
00:08:38,786 --> 00:08:40,154
I was clever or...

108
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,925
...pretty.

109
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:49,663
I guess I just wanted you
to look at me

110
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:50,998
and see someone else.

111
00:08:54,068 --> 00:08:55,569
And I thought
that I would be noticed.

112
00:08:56,871 --> 00:08:58,372
I thought
that I would be seen.

113
00:08:59,006 --> 00:09:01,175
That people would look
at me and I'd think,

114
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:04,311
"They know.
They know what's in there.

115
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:06,814
They can see me."

116
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:10,017
Sounds really foolish,
doesn't it?

117
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:15,389
I guess I am foolish.
Otherwise...

118
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:19,693
I wouldn't be here,
sitting in front of you...

119
00:09:21,162 --> 00:09:23,764
asking you to give me
another chance, Your Honor.

120
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,401
Yeah.

121
00:09:27,468 --> 00:09:28,569
Sorry. I didn't cry.

122
00:09:28,636 --> 00:09:30,204
I think I should've
cried, maybe?

123
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:48,355
Sorry. I didn't cry.

124
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:49,790
I think
I should've cried, maybe?

125
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,459
Such a great instinct.

126
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:53,060
- We got it, though.
- Maybe just...

127
00:09:53,127 --> 00:09:54,462
Should I...
Do you want one more?

128
00:09:54,529 --> 00:09:55,930
I'm happy to just do one more,
if you want.

129
00:09:55,996 --> 00:09:57,198
- You know what? I...

130
00:09:57,298 --> 00:09:58,833
- I thought it was great.
- Great. Awesome.

131
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:00,134
- Perfect. Thank you.
- Okay.

132
00:10:00,201 --> 00:10:01,503
Thanks so much.
Good to see you.

133
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:02,837
Thank you, Sam. Great stuff.

134
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:04,438
Good actor,

135
00:10:04,672 --> 00:10:06,407
but you'd never get
the studio to sign off.

136
00:10:06,474 --> 00:10:08,676
- She's what, 40-something?
- I know.

137
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:10,478
I was just thinking
the same thing.

138
00:10:10,945 --> 00:10:12,246
Do you want
to grab some lunch?

139
00:10:12,313 --> 00:10:13,814
I'm gonna have Benji
go get something for us.

140
00:10:13,881 --> 00:10:15,382
I want you to take a look

141
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:16,684
at this next girl, Chloe Benson.

142
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,620
She's a tad young for the role,
but stunning.

143
00:10:19,687 --> 00:10:21,523
- She just tested for, uh...
- Hey, guys,

144
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,858
I'm so sorry, just,
I forgot my... my phone.

145
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:26,193
Okay. Really great to see you.
Thank you.

146
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,461
Good to see you...

147
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:30,131
You.

148
00:10:30,197 --> 00:10:31,932
You are so fucking good.

149
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:33,667
You know that?
"Singular Samantha."

150
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:35,436
They're going another way
on the movie, but...

151
00:10:35,504 --> 00:10:37,104
- Who got it?
- Uh...

152
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:38,772
I don't think they made
that call yet.

153
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:41,775
They're looking
at someone who is, um...

154
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:42,977
Less experienced.

155
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:45,412
Oh. So, younger?

156
00:10:45,514 --> 00:10:47,582
Fresh face.
Right, well, the character

157
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:48,983
is a divorced
single mother of two,

158
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:51,051
so I don't know how young
they can go, but...

159
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:53,087
Um, well, look,

160
00:10:53,154 --> 00:10:56,290
I'm glad we're here because
I wanted to talk to you guys.

161
00:10:56,357 --> 00:10:58,425
I may not even be...
This is a very
competitive landscape,

162
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:01,061
and I've always tried
to be honest with you.

163
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:04,431
You've never really gone
for the nips or tucks,

164
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:05,833
and I get that.

165
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,835
I respect it.
Thank you.

166
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:11,472
And I can say this to you,
woman-to-woman.

167
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:13,073
With all the
developments lately,

168
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,309
we're seeing new demands
on talent to meet...

169
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:18,946
enhanced standards.
To meet an expectation.

170
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,314
Wow. Okay.

171
00:11:20,381 --> 00:11:22,883
Nobody's asking you
to lose weight.

172
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:25,152
Mm. Mm-mm.
I love that you have a...

173
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:28,889
I love that you don't have
a traditional body type.

174
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,158
We need more women like you.

175
00:11:31,626 --> 00:11:33,127
- Thank you.
- I love it, too.

176
00:11:33,227 --> 00:11:34,428
Just for the record.

177
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:36,063
We want you to consider

178
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:38,667
- some treatment options.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

179
00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:41,001
What about the Shell clinic?
Oh, yes.

180
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:42,836
Yes.
Sorry, what about it?

181
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:44,772
Yeah, we represent
them now for branding.

182
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:46,473
We can have the office
set something up.

183
00:11:47,074 --> 00:11:47,875
Oh, I...

184
00:11:48,309 --> 00:11:50,411
Thank you, but I don't know
if I'm... I'm there yet.

185
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:53,347
Maybe down the line...
Everybody does something.

186
00:11:53,414 --> 00:11:54,549
There's no shame in it.
Right.

187
00:11:54,616 --> 00:11:57,318
Give it a shot.
And if it doesn't work,

188
00:11:57,718 --> 00:12:00,421
well, it doesn't work.

189
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:03,991
Okay, uh, yeah,
I mean, I'll think about it.

190
00:12:28,015 --> 00:12:29,917
What do you know about Shell?

191
00:12:30,784 --> 00:12:32,086
I know it works.

192
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,623
Do you remember Jen Bryer
from seventh grade?

193
00:12:34,689 --> 00:12:35,657
Yeah.

194
00:12:35,724 --> 00:12:37,024
I saw her at Gelson's last week.

195
00:12:37,358 --> 00:12:39,460
Looked like she was still
in seventh grade.

196
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:43,097
Isn't it kind of like,
I don't know, un-feminist?

197
00:12:44,098 --> 00:12:46,867
Zoe Shannon's, like,
the richest woman in America.

198
00:12:47,101 --> 00:12:49,937
And she looks fucking hot.

199
00:12:50,838 --> 00:12:53,140
That's feminist as fuck.
I thought you hated her.

200
00:12:54,008 --> 00:12:55,510
I mean, everyone has
to say they hate her,

201
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:58,445
- but, like, obviously obsessed.
- Yeah.

202
00:12:59,113 --> 00:13:00,615
Do you want to get
a drink after this?

203
00:13:00,682 --> 00:13:02,049
I can't.
I have that date tonight.

204
00:13:02,316 --> 00:13:04,785
With who? Tattoo guy?
Yeah.

205
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:07,254
Hot.
Oh, yeah.

206
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:10,525
So, with the IPO...

207
00:13:10,659 --> 00:13:11,693
That's "initial
public offering."

208
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:13,060
Mm-hmm.
- That's what that means.

209
00:13:13,127 --> 00:13:15,062
Uh, we're probably gonna be
moving forward.

210
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:17,599
And most importantly,
I'm gonna pay back my dad.

211
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:18,966
I'll take this for you.

212
00:13:19,033 --> 00:13:20,801
Thank you.

213
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:23,470
That's amazing.
Yeah, you...

214
00:13:24,773 --> 00:13:26,508
A little something in...
What? What is it? Oh.

215
00:13:26,574 --> 00:13:27,742
Yeah.
Oh, really? Oh.

216
00:13:28,075 --> 00:13:29,910
Oh, is it... oh, God.

217
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:31,680
Don't look.

218
00:13:33,515 --> 00:13:34,716
- Is it gone?
- Yeah.

219
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:36,950
Thanks.
Yeah.
Yeah, no, you got it.

220
00:13:38,152 --> 00:13:40,921
Hey, so you look
so familiar to me.

221
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:43,692
What is it that you...
you do again for a living?

222
00:13:43,758 --> 00:13:44,958
Oh, I'm an actress.

223
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:46,493
No way.
Yeah.

224
00:13:46,561 --> 00:13:47,361
Mostly television.

225
00:13:47,461 --> 00:13:48,896
I knew... I knew
that I recognized you.

226
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:50,831
Really?
Yes. Absolutely.

227
00:13:50,898 --> 00:13:52,199
What... what have I seen you in?

228
00:13:52,266 --> 00:13:54,769
- Oh, probably nothing.
- Well?

229
00:13:55,503 --> 00:13:58,673
Uh, I was on a show that was
quite popular for a while.

230
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,374
It was called
Hannah Got a Heart.

231
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,812
Oh, yeah, no, I know that show.

232
00:14:03,877 --> 00:14:06,313
Uh, the girl
with the talking heart.

233
00:14:06,648 --> 00:14:07,682
Yes.
Yeah.

234
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:09,784
The previous
heart's owner talked to her.

235
00:14:10,084 --> 00:14:11,619
Hilarious.

236
00:14:11,686 --> 00:14:13,220
- What was that like?
- Oh...

237
00:14:13,287 --> 00:14:14,955
Uh, it was the first pilot
I ever did

238
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:16,725
that got picked up,
so that was good.

239
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:18,092
Then I got to work
with all these

240
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:19,527
really experienced
people, and...

241
00:14:19,627 --> 00:14:21,730
But, I mean, it was a bad show.

242
00:14:21,796 --> 00:14:23,665
Right?

243
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:27,769
Oh, um, well, no, it's...
cheesy, yeah, for sure.

244
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:30,672
But I got to do
what I loved, so...
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

245
00:14:30,739 --> 00:14:32,139
Yeah, but it was a bad show.

246
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:34,108
Why would you want to be
on a bad show?

247
00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:35,943
Yeah.

248
00:14:37,444 --> 00:14:38,580
I liked it.

249
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:50,290
I had a really
good time tonight.

250
00:14:50,924 --> 00:14:52,426
Really?
Yeah.

251
00:14:52,493 --> 00:14:53,728
Oh.

252
00:14:53,828 --> 00:14:55,195
Well, I had a nice time, too.

253
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:57,030
Good.

254
00:15:19,888 --> 00:15:21,689
Oh, sorry.

255
00:15:21,756 --> 00:15:23,691
Did you, um, feel that?
It's just, um...

256
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:25,426
I have psoriasis.

257
00:15:26,193 --> 00:15:28,028
It's kind of embarrassing.
It's not contagious or anything.

258
00:15:28,162 --> 00:15:29,831
Oh.
Yeah.

259
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,465
Sometimes when it rains,
it flares up a little.

260
00:15:31,533 --> 00:15:33,835
- Oh, that's... that's cool.
- Yeah.

261
00:15:33,902 --> 00:15:35,804
Is it?
Yeah, no, I just, um...

262
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:38,238
It's not, like, all over
my body or anything.
For sure.

263
00:15:38,305 --> 00:15:40,007
It's, like, in certain spots.
Yeah.

264
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:41,810
Yeah, no, actually,
I just, um...

265
00:15:41,876 --> 00:15:43,210
I have to be up pretty early
tomorrow, so...

266
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:44,913
Oh, you... you do?
Yeah.

267
00:15:44,978 --> 00:15:46,113
Yeah. Um...
Okay.

268
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,015
So...
All right. That's fine.

269
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:50,518
Yeah. Yeah.
Maybe some...

270
00:15:50,785 --> 00:15:51,985
- other time?
- Yeah.

271
00:15:52,052 --> 00:15:53,555
Okay.
Totally. Would love that.

272
00:15:53,655 --> 00:15:54,789
'Cause you have to get up early.

273
00:15:54,856 --> 00:15:56,156
Yeah. Super early.
Okay.

274
00:15:56,223 --> 00:15:57,692
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

275
00:16:03,765 --> 00:16:04,933
First things first.

276
00:16:05,032 --> 00:16:06,668
You say you've had
the treatment yourself.

277
00:16:06,734 --> 00:16:08,268
Yeah. Yes, I have.

278
00:16:08,335 --> 00:16:11,004
So, I have to ask,
how old are you, really?

279
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:13,173
I knew you were gonna
ask me that question.

280
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,543
I just turned 68 in May.

281
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:17,144
- You look amazing.
- Thank you.

282
00:16:17,244 --> 00:16:20,481
But you'll admit,
there's an awful lot of secrecy

283
00:16:20,548 --> 00:16:21,448
about your business.

284
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:24,652
All I want for our clients
is to free them

285
00:16:24,719 --> 00:16:26,453
of self-doubt and inhibition.

286
00:16:27,555 --> 00:16:30,725
To make them feel good,
feel better,

287
00:16:31,058 --> 00:16:32,493
inside and out.

288
00:16:33,928 --> 00:16:36,430
I mean, you can't fight
the future.

289
00:16:38,298 --> 00:16:40,869
And the future is here.

290
00:17:01,154 --> 00:17:02,222
Welcome to Shell.

291
00:17:02,289 --> 00:17:03,525
We hope you enjoy
your visitation.

292
00:17:03,591 --> 00:17:04,659
Thank you.

293
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:26,514
Hi. I'm Samantha Lake.

294
00:17:26,581 --> 00:17:28,415
I'm here to check in
for my appointment.

295
00:17:28,716 --> 00:17:30,718
Wonderful. So, I'll just
need your signature

296
00:17:30,818 --> 00:17:32,119
on a few things, okay?

297
00:17:35,557 --> 00:17:37,491
This is our
non-disclosure agreement...

298
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:39,627
to protect our more
high-profile clients.

299
00:17:39,694 --> 00:17:40,828
Right. Mm-hmm.

300
00:17:40,895 --> 00:17:42,162
Your doctor will be able

301
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:44,064
to answer any questions
in your consultation.

302
00:17:44,164 --> 00:17:46,133
We'll just need that signature,

303
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,803
and you can make your way over
to the changing station.

304
00:17:52,774 --> 00:17:54,174
Thank you.

305
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,578
Um, ma'am?

306
00:17:56,945 --> 00:17:59,313
That way.

307
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:06,988
Hello. I'm Dr. Thaddeus Brand,

308
00:18:07,055 --> 00:18:09,557
and I'm here to tell you
about Shell...

309
00:18:10,792 --> 00:18:12,192
fish.

310
00:18:12,594 --> 00:18:16,330
There are organisms existing
in this world today

311
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:21,201
that do not experience
the process known as senescence.

312
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:25,506
Put more simply,
these creatures...

313
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:28,342
the jellyfish, the common hydra,

314
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:31,746
flatworms, sponges, axolotls,

315
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:33,648
the lobster...

316
00:18:34,181 --> 00:18:36,116
these creatures do not age,

317
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,485
thanks to the telomerase enzyme,

318
00:18:38,553 --> 00:18:41,288
which protects the ends
of their chromosomes.

319
00:18:41,355 --> 00:18:45,425
Several years ago,
I discovered a unique linkage

320
00:18:45,492 --> 00:18:48,228
between crustacean enzymes

321
00:18:48,563 --> 00:18:51,666
and the exoskeletal
growth process.

322
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:55,135
By introducing
a genetically altered version

323
00:18:55,202 --> 00:18:56,771
into human cells,

324
00:18:57,672 --> 00:19:00,541
we were able to arrest
the outward signs of aging...

325
00:19:00,608 --> 00:19:02,577
Ms. Lake,
if you'd like to follow me,

326
00:19:02,644 --> 00:19:04,244
I can escort you
to the changing station.

327
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:05,680
Okay.
...at Shell,

328
00:19:06,213 --> 00:19:08,850
immortality begins today.

329
00:19:53,961 --> 00:19:55,362
Hold on one second.

330
00:19:57,932 --> 00:19:59,332
Ms. Lake?

331
00:20:02,136 --> 00:20:03,538
Hi. I'm Dr. Hubert.

332
00:20:03,938 --> 00:20:05,807
We're a little early,
but I can change the...

333
00:20:05,873 --> 00:20:08,308
No, actually, I was just
looking for the, um...

334
00:20:10,645 --> 00:20:12,947
You know what? I'm sorry,
Doctor, this just...

335
00:20:13,014 --> 00:20:14,949
This isn't for me, so...
I see.

336
00:20:16,084 --> 00:20:17,719
Is it all right if I ask why?

337
00:20:18,251 --> 00:20:19,854
It's just a little...

338
00:20:20,287 --> 00:20:22,724
Ah, spooky?
Yeah.

339
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,726
Yeah, I get that.

340
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:26,661
Look...

341
00:20:27,161 --> 00:20:28,462
why don't we have
a conversation,

342
00:20:28,529 --> 00:20:30,430
and if you're still
having any doubts afterwards,

343
00:20:30,497 --> 00:20:32,767
I will walk you out myself.

344
00:20:35,469 --> 00:20:37,237
We also have amazing ice cream.

345
00:20:38,438 --> 00:20:40,407
I was treating this burn victim.

346
00:20:40,508 --> 00:20:42,342
This is an image of the damage

347
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:44,444
right before her
B-One procedure.

348
00:20:45,012 --> 00:20:46,748
That is two weeks after,

349
00:20:47,749 --> 00:20:49,917
and after her first
skin shedding,

350
00:20:50,952 --> 00:20:52,553
no markings anywhere.

351
00:20:53,353 --> 00:20:54,756
In a few months,
it was all gone.

352
00:20:55,056 --> 00:20:56,190
That's impressive.

353
00:20:56,356 --> 00:20:58,826
The treatment doesn't just
halt the aging process.

354
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:01,562
It facilitates cellular repair,

355
00:21:01,629 --> 00:21:06,234
making it more durable
for the skin to actually heal

356
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:07,902
and... and be faster at it.

357
00:21:09,036 --> 00:21:11,839
The psoriasis, how long have
you been dealing with that?

358
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:14,809
A while.

359
00:21:15,543 --> 00:21:17,545
I mean, it's like, you know,
it comes and goes.

360
00:21:17,645 --> 00:21:19,247
Well, I see no reason
why we can't

361
00:21:19,312 --> 00:21:21,048
eliminate flare-ups altogether.

362
00:21:24,484 --> 00:21:26,788
Is it dangerous?

363
00:21:27,688 --> 00:21:29,791
The procedure? 'Cause,
you know, I've heard stories.

364
00:21:29,857 --> 00:21:32,059
We had one patient
whose head exploded,

365
00:21:32,126 --> 00:21:34,162
but that was
a technical malfunction.

366
00:21:34,228 --> 00:21:35,997
Highly unlikely
that's gonna happen again.

367
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,135
That was a joke, by the way.

368
00:21:41,202 --> 00:21:42,469
No, I know.

369
00:21:42,537 --> 00:21:44,939
I mean, it is a surgery.
There's bound to be some risks,

370
00:21:45,006 --> 00:21:46,641
but it is completely painless

371
00:21:46,874 --> 00:21:51,344
and it's far less invasive
than Botox or LASIK.

372
00:21:52,647 --> 00:21:54,816
- I had LASIK.
- Yeah, I see that.

373
00:21:54,982 --> 00:21:56,083
You know...

374
00:21:56,884 --> 00:21:58,820
new patients come in here
all the time,

375
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,721
and they want, like,
bigger muscles

376
00:22:00,788 --> 00:22:03,423
or higher cheekbones,
and I can't help those people.

377
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:06,994
But if you're interested
in moving forward,

378
00:22:07,094 --> 00:22:09,197
your psoriasis will fade away,

379
00:22:09,263 --> 00:22:12,399
you will be healthier
and you'll feel better.

380
00:22:12,767 --> 00:22:15,036
If you're consistent
with the treatment,

381
00:22:15,703 --> 00:22:16,671
in 20 years,

382
00:22:16,971 --> 00:22:19,674
you will not look one day older
than you do right now.

383
00:22:23,544 --> 00:22:24,946
So, what flavors do you have?

384
00:22:25,847 --> 00:22:26,881
Flavors?

385
00:22:27,782 --> 00:22:28,616
Ice cream.

386
00:22:30,852 --> 00:22:32,286
This will allow you time

387
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:33,386
to relax

388
00:22:33,588 --> 00:22:34,989
as the serum is delivered
intravenously

389
00:22:35,056 --> 00:22:36,691
and begins to work its magic.

390
00:22:36,757 --> 00:22:38,793
Following your I.V. treatment,
you will be taken

391
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,795
to the rebirth chamber
for the next stage

392
00:22:40,862 --> 00:22:43,531
of your Shell experience.
Once the procedure begins,

393
00:22:43,631 --> 00:22:45,900
our exclusive
laser technology...

394
00:22:45,967 --> 00:22:46,767
Sam?

395
00:22:46,834 --> 00:22:49,402
- Jesus.
- No way.

396
00:22:51,172 --> 00:22:52,640
Can you believe this?

397
00:22:52,907 --> 00:22:54,208
No, I can't.

398
00:22:54,609 --> 00:22:56,443
Isn't it wild
when you just, like,

399
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:58,112
keep running into someone?

400
00:22:58,179 --> 00:23:00,447
Yeah. Yeah, it's unsettling.

401
00:23:00,648 --> 00:23:02,250
Totally.

402
00:23:02,884 --> 00:23:05,353
I heard you got that movie.
That's...

403
00:23:05,418 --> 00:23:07,255
- I mean, wow. Congrats.
- Oh, the movie.

404
00:23:07,355 --> 00:23:08,990
It sucks, I can't do it.

405
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:11,158
You can't?

406
00:23:12,459 --> 00:23:13,895
I'm not supposed to
tell anyone yet,

407
00:23:13,995 --> 00:23:17,098
but I think I'm gonna be
the new Catwoman.

408
00:23:17,798 --> 00:23:19,499
- What?
- Isn't that crazy?

409
00:23:19,934 --> 00:23:21,535
Jesus. Yeah.

410
00:23:21,702 --> 00:23:23,938
Such a bummer.
It was a really cool script.

411
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:25,840
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

412
00:23:26,173 --> 00:23:29,176
Aren't you a... aren't you
a little young for this?

413
00:23:30,144 --> 00:23:31,444
Young for what?

414
00:23:31,946 --> 00:23:33,281
For the treatment.

415
00:23:33,614 --> 00:23:35,349
I mean, you're what, 22?

416
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:36,584
Mm-hmm.

417
00:23:38,619 --> 00:23:40,054
Oh, sorry.

418
00:23:40,121 --> 00:23:41,255
Sorry.

419
00:23:41,355 --> 00:23:43,324
I'm just... I think I'm nervous.

420
00:23:43,724 --> 00:23:46,160
You probably won't
remember this,

421
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,396
but when I was a kid,

422
00:23:48,562 --> 00:23:50,231
you took me to this
swimming class

423
00:23:50,298 --> 00:23:53,034
and we were all supposed to
jump off this diving board,

424
00:23:53,134 --> 00:23:55,636
I was totally freaking out.

425
00:23:56,337 --> 00:23:58,706
And you said this thing
to calm me down.

426
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,042
It was so simple, you said,

427
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:03,644
"Maybe you're not as scared
as you think."

428
00:24:04,612 --> 00:24:05,846
And you were right.

429
00:24:06,547 --> 00:24:08,749
I jumped and I was fine.

430
00:24:09,517 --> 00:24:12,687
I still say it to myself
sometimes when I get nervous,

431
00:24:13,154 --> 00:24:16,023
which is a lot.

432
00:24:18,292 --> 00:24:19,727
I don't know.

433
00:24:20,428 --> 00:24:22,462
Maybe you're not as scared
as you think.

434
00:24:23,698 --> 00:24:25,132
Maybe you got this.

435
00:24:37,878 --> 00:24:39,814
Nurse,
how we looking?

436
00:24:40,181 --> 00:24:41,549
Levels are good.

437
00:24:41,949 --> 00:24:43,451
We're gonna get
started, okay?

438
00:24:43,517 --> 00:24:45,786
Okay, Doctor.
See you on the other side.

439
00:24:46,187 --> 00:24:47,487
I think we should begin.

440
00:25:05,406 --> 00:25:07,274
System on.

441
00:25:11,579 --> 00:25:13,914
Initializing body scan.

442
00:25:43,677 --> 00:25:45,980
It's all over. You were great.

443
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:51,919
Did it go okay?
Without a hitch.

444
00:25:54,121 --> 00:25:57,158
I had some weird dreams
during the procedure.

445
00:25:57,224 --> 00:26:00,094
Yeah, it's completely normal.
It's just the anesthesia.

446
00:26:01,295 --> 00:26:02,730
And that is not permanent.

447
00:26:02,797 --> 00:26:04,799
It's just to cover up the scars
until it heals.

448
00:26:04,865 --> 00:26:07,735
And you see the psoriasis
is all cleared up.

449
00:26:07,802 --> 00:26:09,136
Just be careful
on your way down.

450
00:26:09,203 --> 00:26:11,072
Nurse, can you sign out
Ms. Lake for me?

451
00:26:11,138 --> 00:26:13,542
Someone at reception will
schedule a follow-up,

452
00:26:13,607 --> 00:26:14,942
all right?

453
00:26:15,409 --> 00:26:17,611
Is that it?
You are good to go.

454
00:26:17,978 --> 00:26:20,047
Thank you, Doctor.
How do you feel?

455
00:26:22,183 --> 00:26:23,584
I feel good.

456
00:26:26,987 --> 00:26:28,189
Hi. I'm Samantha Lake.
Hi.

457
00:26:28,255 --> 00:26:29,757
And I'm here to pick up my cat.

458
00:26:29,824 --> 00:26:31,826
- Okay. What's the cat's name?
- Salem.

459
00:26:32,293 --> 00:26:33,327
Like Sabrina.

460
00:26:33,427 --> 00:26:34,529
Hmm?

461
00:26:34,762 --> 00:26:35,996
Sabrina
the Teenage Witch.

462
00:26:36,664 --> 00:26:38,533
She had a cat named Salem, too.

463
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:39,900
Yeah.

464
00:26:40,701 --> 00:26:42,369
No one has ever gotten
that reference.

465
00:26:44,105 --> 00:26:45,272
I get the reference.

466
00:26:46,607 --> 00:26:47,808
Yeah.

467
00:26:48,476 --> 00:26:49,511
Yes, you do.

468
00:27:20,474 --> 00:27:22,409
Shut the fuck up.

469
00:27:22,943 --> 00:27:24,613
You think you'll actually
get to meet her?

470
00:27:24,678 --> 00:27:25,679
Well, it's at her house.

471
00:27:25,846 --> 00:27:27,148
Yeah, but there's probably
gonna be, like,

472
00:27:27,214 --> 00:27:28,315
a lot of people there.

473
00:27:28,749 --> 00:27:32,019
You need to text me
the whole time.

474
00:27:33,487 --> 00:27:34,688
Okay, I'm done.

475
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:37,057
You go ahead. I'm staying on.

476
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,193
Freak.

477
00:28:34,014 --> 00:28:37,751
My babies. Happy holidays!

478
00:28:38,118 --> 00:28:40,254
Oh, gosh, you look gorgeous.

479
00:28:40,354 --> 00:28:42,323
Did you end up
getting divorced?

480
00:28:42,691 --> 00:28:44,858
I know. I know, I'm so happy.

481
00:28:44,925 --> 00:28:46,894
Come on.

482
00:28:49,797 --> 00:28:51,398
I've seen you. I've seen you.

483
00:28:51,465 --> 00:28:53,100
How are you? Happy holidays.

484
00:28:53,167 --> 00:28:54,301
Hi!

485
00:28:54,368 --> 00:28:55,637
How is your, um...

486
00:28:57,438 --> 00:28:58,205
So, how's your family?

487
00:28:58,506 --> 00:28:59,740
- Oh, they're doing...
- They're great.

488
00:28:59,807 --> 00:29:01,041
They're great. Wonderful.

489
00:29:01,108 --> 00:29:03,712
Um...

490
00:29:03,777 --> 00:29:05,312
Excuse me one second.

491
00:29:05,379 --> 00:29:07,582
You go get a drink. You, too.

492
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,523
Samantha Lake. My God.

493
00:29:15,856 --> 00:29:17,659
I heard you came
into the clinic.

494
00:29:17,726 --> 00:29:19,326
I told the guys
I wanted to meet you.

495
00:29:20,729 --> 00:29:21,996
When my mother was sick,

496
00:29:22,062 --> 00:29:24,465
we watched every episode
of your show.

497
00:29:24,699 --> 00:29:26,467
Oh, wow. Um...

498
00:29:26,534 --> 00:29:28,769
I'm so embarrassed.
No, don't be.

499
00:29:28,869 --> 00:29:29,937
I mean, sure,
it's a little cheesy.

500
00:29:30,004 --> 00:29:31,071
We fucking loved it.

501
00:29:31,372 --> 00:29:34,008
Plus, it kept us from cutting
each other's heads off.

502
00:29:34,676 --> 00:29:37,746
And you look...
exactly the same.

503
00:29:37,811 --> 00:29:40,548
Oh, well, thanks to you.
Stop it.

504
00:29:40,649 --> 00:29:42,584
Who did you have? Tennyson?

505
00:29:42,717 --> 00:29:43,951
Uh, Dr. Hubert.

506
00:29:44,118 --> 00:29:46,453
The best.
Plus, he's, like, hot, right?

507
00:29:46,554 --> 00:29:49,256
Um, yes.

508
00:29:49,456 --> 00:29:51,358
Walk with me
while I check on the kitchen.

509
00:29:51,425 --> 00:29:52,359
Okay.

510
00:29:52,826 --> 00:29:54,895
- How tall are you?
- Five-three...

511
00:29:54,962 --> 00:29:56,096
Oh.
...and a half.

512
00:29:56,163 --> 00:29:57,898
I'm five-eight.
Just reached it this year.

513
00:29:57,965 --> 00:29:59,133
Grew, inch and a quarter.

514
00:29:59,199 --> 00:30:01,468
You got taller?
Yeah, every skin cycle.

515
00:30:01,536 --> 00:30:04,673
I mean, you wouldn't think that
that little extra would matter,

516
00:30:04,739 --> 00:30:06,874
but, ooh, let me tell you.

517
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,976
Nobody said
it would make me taller.

518
00:30:14,415 --> 00:30:16,350
Mm, mm, mm! Oh!

519
00:30:17,318 --> 00:30:18,385
So fucking good.

520
00:30:20,254 --> 00:30:22,791
Um, you don't cook?
Do you cook?

521
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:24,491
No. I mean, not like you.

522
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,994
I have watched your entire
Chef Class series.

523
00:30:27,061 --> 00:30:29,163
Aw, you're so sweet.

524
00:30:29,597 --> 00:30:30,632
Well, I love learning.

525
00:30:30,931 --> 00:30:33,000
Just last week, I was
at this Greek fishing village

526
00:30:33,067 --> 00:30:35,336
learning how to make
a traditional stifado,

527
00:30:35,402 --> 00:30:36,604
but we did it with fish.

528
00:30:37,271 --> 00:30:38,005
Oh!

529
00:30:38,405 --> 00:30:39,741
Anyway, next time you're here,
I'll make it for you.

530
00:30:39,808 --> 00:30:42,209
Wow. Well, I don't know
what that is,

531
00:30:42,276 --> 00:30:44,278
but I feel like
I'm going to love it.

532
00:30:50,084 --> 00:30:51,553
How do you not know her?

533
00:30:51,619 --> 00:30:53,688
- I've never seen her.
- She was on the Heart show.

534
00:30:53,755 --> 00:30:54,689
Oh.
Mmm.

535
00:30:54,756 --> 00:30:55,989
It's like
a guilty pleasure.

536
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:58,693
Don't you think there's a...
Samantha.

537
00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:00,394
Honey, look over here.

538
00:31:01,195 --> 00:31:03,297
Don't we look related?

539
00:31:04,498 --> 00:31:05,667
Oh.

540
00:31:05,834 --> 00:31:07,334
Ki... Kind of.

541
00:31:07,868 --> 00:31:09,637
Like we could be cousins.
Maybe.

542
00:31:09,704 --> 00:31:10,938
Second cousins.
Yes.

543
00:31:11,004 --> 00:31:12,373
Absolutely.
See?

544
00:31:12,439 --> 00:31:14,441
I knew it.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, I see it.

545
00:31:14,509 --> 00:31:18,680
Let's all thank our lovely host
for this gorgeous meal

546
00:31:18,912 --> 00:31:21,783
with these gorgeous faces.
We love you, Zo.

547
00:31:22,082 --> 00:31:23,818
Thank you. Bon appétit.

548
00:31:24,118 --> 00:31:26,487
Bon appétit. Cheers.

549
00:31:34,395 --> 00:31:35,496
Hmm.

550
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:38,332
This is delicious.

551
00:31:38,833 --> 00:31:39,834
What is it?

552
00:31:39,933 --> 00:31:42,202
Mm. It's me.

553
00:31:43,738 --> 00:31:45,105
Yeah, really.

554
00:31:45,507 --> 00:31:47,509
Normally, we throw out
the old skin,

555
00:31:47,575 --> 00:31:49,844
but it's very protein-rich,
almost no fat.

556
00:31:50,344 --> 00:31:53,147
Well, almost.

557
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:58,118
Wow.

558
00:31:59,019 --> 00:32:00,722
I think this is the best
you've ever tasted.

559
00:32:00,822 --> 00:32:02,423
Mm, you would know.

560
00:32:04,458 --> 00:32:05,459
I've had a lot of her.

561
00:32:05,527 --> 00:32:06,927
Mm-hmm.

562
00:32:07,862 --> 00:32:09,096
You like it?

563
00:32:16,905 --> 00:32:18,005
Mmm.

564
00:32:18,071 --> 00:32:19,473
Beautiful.

565
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:26,146
Touch of gray,
the wrinkles around the eyes.

566
00:32:26,213 --> 00:32:27,014
Mm.

567
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,116
It suggests a depth and sadness,

568
00:32:29,183 --> 00:32:30,785
don't you think?
Yeah, totally.

569
00:32:30,852 --> 00:32:32,319
Yeah, but for a woman,

570
00:32:32,386 --> 00:32:34,455
I mean, you chose
the perfect moment.

571
00:32:34,522 --> 00:32:35,989
You're glowing head to toe.
Thank you.

572
00:32:36,056 --> 00:32:37,692
We...
Thank you.

573
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:39,092
Okay, we're going swimming.

574
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:40,528
Okay.
Join us.

575
00:33:52,432 --> 00:33:53,568
Creep.

576
00:33:59,941 --> 00:34:03,343
I'm so sorry. I was just...
I was looking for the bathroom.

577
00:34:09,017 --> 00:34:10,417
It's fine.

578
00:34:11,051 --> 00:34:13,788
All these people...

579
00:34:14,622 --> 00:34:17,057
Sometimes I just need
to center myself.

580
00:34:17,792 --> 00:34:21,663
Um, I think I might head...
head out soon, so...

581
00:34:21,763 --> 00:34:24,064
Oh, you're not gonna bitch out
already, are you?

582
00:34:25,033 --> 00:34:28,101
I have to f...
I have to feed my cat.

583
00:34:30,437 --> 00:34:32,306
I remember the first month
of treatment

584
00:34:32,372 --> 00:34:34,308
was the most fun I ever had.

585
00:34:34,676 --> 00:34:35,843
You don't feel that way?

586
00:34:49,156 --> 00:34:50,457
I do feel it.

587
00:34:52,492 --> 00:34:53,561
But, um...

588
00:34:55,329 --> 00:34:58,098
When I first told my mom
I was moving to L.A.,

589
00:34:59,667 --> 00:35:00,668
she said,

590
00:35:01,002 --> 00:35:03,871
"No matter how much
you doll yourself up,

591
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:08,042
they'll still notice
that you don't belong there."

592
00:35:08,676 --> 00:35:10,945
Mm. She sounds like
a real bitch.

593
00:35:14,082 --> 00:35:16,116
I think she's probably right,

594
00:35:16,851 --> 00:35:21,055
'cause I'm always the girl
with the run in my tights

595
00:35:21,154 --> 00:35:23,625
or the food in my teeth.

596
00:35:34,702 --> 00:35:36,804
I don't see any food
in your teeth.

597
00:35:39,507 --> 00:35:42,242
You are the personification
of pulchritude.

598
00:35:44,612 --> 00:35:47,247
Good word, huh?
It means "beauty."

599
00:35:47,715 --> 00:35:50,618
I love it
'cause it sounds disgusting.

600
00:35:53,087 --> 00:35:54,989
You need to get out
of your head, Sam.

601
00:35:55,355 --> 00:35:58,526
When you understand
how others perceive you,

602
00:35:59,426 --> 00:36:01,395
it's much easier
to get what you want.

603
00:36:02,997 --> 00:36:04,766
I want you to do something
for me.

604
00:36:27,454 --> 00:36:29,791
I want you to look
in this mirror...

605
00:36:31,859 --> 00:36:35,429
and do not leave this room
until you make yourself come.

606
00:36:36,998 --> 00:36:39,366
- Zoe, that's...
- Yes.

607
00:36:41,102 --> 00:36:42,402
You got it.

608
00:36:43,303 --> 00:36:45,039
I want you to see how I see you,

609
00:36:45,106 --> 00:36:47,575
how the world will see you
going forward.

610
00:36:51,344 --> 00:36:53,681
Confident.

611
00:36:54,749 --> 00:36:55,850
Strong.

612
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,854
Sexy.

613
00:37:08,428 --> 00:37:09,997
I'll know if you didn't do it.

614
00:38:01,381 --> 00:38:03,551
At that rate, it's just so late.

615
00:38:12,927 --> 00:38:14,762
One moment,
everything was perfect,

616
00:38:14,829 --> 00:38:16,731
and then... we met.

617
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,735
And it all just fell apart.

618
00:38:23,871 --> 00:38:28,042
I just wanted for so long
to be noticed.

619
00:38:30,812 --> 00:38:32,914
I wanted them to look
at me and think...

620
00:38:34,882 --> 00:38:37,417
that I was smart or...

621
00:38:38,385 --> 00:38:39,720
funny or...

622
00:38:41,956 --> 00:38:42,990
...pretty.

623
00:38:47,228 --> 00:38:48,996
I guess I just wanted you
to look at me

624
00:38:49,063 --> 00:38:50,397
and see someone else.

625
00:38:54,434 --> 00:38:56,637
And that's a cut!
We've got it.

626
00:39:03,144 --> 00:39:04,278
Thank you.

627
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:06,280
Good job, Sam.

628
00:39:06,614 --> 00:39:08,381
All right,
moving on. Scene 11's next.

629
00:40:20,554 --> 00:40:22,489
I was looking for you.

630
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:28,029
Come inside. The kids
are gonna play us something.

631
00:40:28,129 --> 00:40:29,429
Okay.

632
00:40:45,112 --> 00:40:46,479
Mm.

633
00:40:48,481 --> 00:40:49,583
They're so good.

634
00:40:49,917 --> 00:40:52,253
I MEAN, I'M...

635
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,453
...speechless.
I know.

636
00:40:53,688 --> 00:40:55,589
Well, Rafi is the dark horse.

637
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:57,191
He wanted a harp.

638
00:40:57,525 --> 00:40:59,293
And we were like,
"What about a cello?"

639
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,128
And... But he wanted that harp,

640
00:41:01,195 --> 00:41:03,731
so I got him a fucking harp,
and he actually plays it.

641
00:41:05,032 --> 00:41:07,034
How are your kids so young?

642
00:41:07,101 --> 00:41:08,269
It's the B.I.

643
00:41:08,336 --> 00:41:10,538
Keeps your uterus
fresh as a daisy.

644
00:41:10,604 --> 00:41:12,073
Ronny didn't want children,

645
00:41:12,173 --> 00:41:13,841
but I knew I would wear him down

646
00:41:13,908 --> 00:41:15,710
one day.

647
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:19,246
Luckily, we waited.
It's a real time suck.

648
00:41:19,313 --> 00:41:23,317
Mm-hmm. Where is Ronny?
I don't think I've met him yet.

649
00:41:23,384 --> 00:41:25,319
Oh, no, we don't
live together. No.

650
00:41:25,553 --> 00:41:28,656
We're...
non-domestic co-parents.

651
00:41:29,123 --> 00:41:31,292
People think it's weird,
works for us.

652
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:32,660
We still sleep together.

653
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:33,928
Hey, Doc?

654
00:41:33,995 --> 00:41:35,029
Mm-hmm?

655
00:41:35,096 --> 00:41:36,364
What's taking so long?

656
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:37,732
Patience.

657
00:41:37,798 --> 00:41:39,467
All good things come
to those who wait.

658
00:41:39,533 --> 00:41:42,837
But I'm starving. Hurry up.

659
00:41:43,704 --> 00:41:45,072
What about Hubert?

660
00:41:46,307 --> 00:41:47,208
Oh. I'm...

661
00:41:47,441 --> 00:41:49,810
I don't know.
Yes. He is age-appropriate.

662
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:52,046
He's attractive. He's smart.

663
00:41:52,146 --> 00:41:53,614
He's rich.
Exactly.

664
00:41:53,681 --> 00:41:55,316
I think he can do
way better than me.

665
00:41:55,383 --> 00:41:56,851
Oh, he'd be lucky to have you.

666
00:41:57,218 --> 00:41:59,820
What? You're in this cool
new movie, you're...

667
00:42:00,488 --> 00:42:02,256
funny, and you're...

668
00:42:02,323 --> 00:42:04,425
Well, okay,
you're not that funny...

669
00:42:04,525 --> 00:42:06,227
...but you're hot.

670
00:42:07,928 --> 00:42:09,063
Thanks.

671
00:42:10,031 --> 00:42:12,066
You're way too nice to me.

672
00:42:12,133 --> 00:42:13,167
No.

673
00:42:13,901 --> 00:42:14,935
We're friends.

674
00:42:15,403 --> 00:42:16,904
Friends tell each other
the truth.

675
00:42:18,472 --> 00:42:19,473
Can I tell you a secret?

676
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:20,741
Oh, yeah.

677
00:42:21,409 --> 00:42:24,245
So, Shannon isn't
my real last name.

678
00:42:25,212 --> 00:42:26,614
It's not?
Mm-mm.

679
00:42:27,114 --> 00:42:29,150
No. My real last name?

680
00:42:30,351 --> 00:42:31,619
Zilt.

681
00:42:32,553 --> 00:42:33,621
It's Zilt?

682
00:42:33,687 --> 00:42:35,322
My last name is Zilt.

683
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:37,058
It's awful.

684
00:42:37,124 --> 00:42:40,861
It's, like,
Norwegian for "venison."

685
00:42:41,062 --> 00:42:43,030
- Like the meat?
- Like the meat.

686
00:42:43,697 --> 00:42:45,966
Changed it my senior year,

687
00:42:46,535 --> 00:42:47,902
never looked back.

688
00:42:49,603 --> 00:42:52,139
Well, my name's not
my real name, either.

689
00:42:52,206 --> 00:42:52,940
You see?

690
00:42:53,274 --> 00:42:55,176
We're both pretending
to be someone we're not.

691
00:42:58,547 --> 00:42:59,747
I like you.

692
00:43:00,181 --> 00:43:01,148
Thank you.

693
00:43:02,216 --> 00:43:03,250
We should be friends.

694
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:04,685
Best of friends.

695
00:43:06,654 --> 00:43:07,688
Please.

696
00:43:07,855 --> 00:43:09,790
You two are inseparable.
I've been replaced.

697
00:43:11,659 --> 00:43:13,160
You literally have no good
snacks anymore.

698
00:43:13,227 --> 00:43:14,495
It's all Shell food.

699
00:43:15,029 --> 00:43:16,831
- It's healthy food.
- Exactly.

700
00:43:16,897 --> 00:43:18,032
You're turning into Zoe.

701
00:43:18,099 --> 00:43:19,900
Soon you'll be
60 percent flaxseed.

702
00:43:20,301 --> 00:43:21,469
Look, if you don't want to do

703
00:43:21,536 --> 00:43:22,670
this assistant thing,
it's totally fine.

704
00:43:22,837 --> 00:43:24,338
You volunteered, but if
you're not comfortable...

705
00:43:24,405 --> 00:43:26,273
No, no, no, no.
Wait. No. I do.

706
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:28,809
Okay, well, maybe start
with the unpacking, then.

707
00:43:29,343 --> 00:43:31,645
Okay. Geez Louise.

708
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:39,153
Aw...

709
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,489
Look at this.
This is not unpacking.

710
00:43:41,556 --> 00:43:43,691
This is looking at things.
No, no. Look.

711
00:43:46,561 --> 00:43:48,229
I look terrifying.
Yeah.

712
00:43:48,295 --> 00:43:49,396
Well, we both do.

713
00:43:49,463 --> 00:43:50,532
Mm. Skinny, though.

714
00:43:50,731 --> 00:43:52,534
Well, we were 12, so...

715
00:43:52,601 --> 00:43:53,634
...everyone's skinny.

716
00:43:53,934 --> 00:43:55,870
What's that?
What's what?

717
00:43:56,704 --> 00:43:58,038
On your neck.

718
00:43:58,507 --> 00:43:59,874
What do you mean?

719
00:44:00,374 --> 00:44:01,675
What...?

720
00:44:02,309 --> 00:44:03,244
That?
Yeah.

721
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:05,012
Do you feel that?
Well... Yeah, what is it?

722
00:44:05,312 --> 00:44:06,247
Is that a mole?

723
00:44:06,313 --> 00:44:07,715
I don't have a mole there.

724
00:44:08,115 --> 00:44:09,350
So, is it a bite?

725
00:44:09,518 --> 00:44:10,585
I don't know.

726
00:44:10,784 --> 00:44:12,920
Can you feel that?
Yeah, don't touch it.

727
00:44:15,456 --> 00:44:16,957
I don't know.
Get that checked out.

728
00:44:17,091 --> 00:44:18,659
Okay.
Okay.

729
00:44:19,093 --> 00:44:20,595
Okay, can you please continue?

730
00:44:20,661 --> 00:44:22,429
You were on a roll there.
Yes. Yes.

731
00:44:22,496 --> 00:44:24,165
Of course.
You had one thing out.

732
00:44:24,265 --> 00:44:25,166
Uh-huh.

733
00:44:25,534 --> 00:44:28,736
Where do you want all these
precious photo albums to go?

734
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:31,438
Um... try the living room.

735
00:44:31,506 --> 00:44:33,040
- Thank you.
- Got it.

736
00:44:34,509 --> 00:44:36,611
All right.
I'm gonna count to three, okay?

737
00:44:36,677 --> 00:44:37,711
'Kay.

738
00:44:38,012 --> 00:44:40,080
You know what?
This is a sticky guy.

739
00:44:40,147 --> 00:44:41,982
Three. Two.

740
00:44:42,116 --> 00:44:43,250
Got it.
Ow.

741
00:44:43,484 --> 00:44:44,619
Now, I'll run a biopsy.

742
00:44:44,985 --> 00:44:47,388
But I don't think this is
any cause for concern.

743
00:44:50,357 --> 00:44:52,092
It's too early for
the molting thing, right?

744
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:53,060
Correct.

745
00:44:53,127 --> 00:44:55,429
Though the coloring
is a little unusual.

746
00:44:55,496 --> 00:44:57,198
This is just excess skin.

747
00:44:57,464 --> 00:44:59,833
It might spread a little more
before it dissipates,

748
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:02,102
but this is totally benign.

749
00:45:02,469 --> 00:45:03,437
Okay.

750
00:45:06,006 --> 00:45:07,841
I'm going to prescribe you

751
00:45:07,942 --> 00:45:10,377
a topical cream,
to be on the safe side.

752
00:45:10,878 --> 00:45:13,447
Also, on the back
is my cell phone.

753
00:45:13,881 --> 00:45:17,652
Just in case there's a moment
where you, you know...

754
00:45:17,785 --> 00:45:20,154
In case I wake up
with six toes?

755
00:45:20,589 --> 00:45:21,989
Exactly.

756
00:46:36,531 --> 00:46:39,601
I'm Detective Flores.
This is Detective Abramson.

757
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,268
Nice place.

758
00:46:41,335 --> 00:46:42,102
Thank you.

759
00:46:42,169 --> 00:46:44,338
Uh, I'm still unpacking,
but, um...

760
00:46:45,339 --> 00:46:47,408
Sorry, do you want a coffee
or tea, or can I get you...

761
00:46:47,474 --> 00:46:49,176
We won't take up
too much of your time.
Okay.

762
00:46:49,376 --> 00:46:52,079
You're a patient at
the Shell clinic, correct?

763
00:46:52,413 --> 00:46:53,581
Yeah. I was just there.

764
00:46:53,648 --> 00:46:54,716
Oh.

765
00:46:55,115 --> 00:46:59,119
And you also had an appointment
on the 12th of December, right?

766
00:46:59,253 --> 00:47:00,421
I'd have to check.

767
00:47:01,221 --> 00:47:03,057
Sorry, am I in trouble
or something?

768
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:04,391
Well, I hope not.

769
00:47:05,059 --> 00:47:07,061
Did you have a conversation
with another patient

770
00:47:07,127 --> 00:47:08,630
when you were visiting that day?

771
00:47:08,962 --> 00:47:09,963
Chloe Benson?

772
00:47:10,497 --> 00:47:13,167
Um, I signed an NDA,
so I don't think...

773
00:47:14,703 --> 00:47:15,770
Is everything all right?

774
00:47:16,136 --> 00:47:17,605
Ms. Benson's missing.

775
00:47:19,774 --> 00:47:21,008
- Missing?
- Yeah.

776
00:47:21,075 --> 00:47:22,677
That day at the clinic,
that was the last time

777
00:47:22,744 --> 00:47:24,378
- anyone saw her.
- Wow.

778
00:47:24,445 --> 00:47:27,147
We checked with all her people,
and no one's heard from her.

779
00:47:27,749 --> 00:47:29,183
Including you, I'm guessing?

780
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:31,452
Yeah.
We spoke to her family.

781
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:33,487
They mentioned that you two
had reconnected, so...

782
00:47:33,555 --> 00:47:36,323
we were just wondering
if she'd reached out.

783
00:47:36,791 --> 00:47:37,759
Um...

784
00:47:37,925 --> 00:47:39,927
No. We don't know
each other very well.

785
00:47:40,027 --> 00:47:41,796
I was her babysitter.

786
00:47:41,895 --> 00:47:43,598
A long time ago, obviously,

787
00:47:44,198 --> 00:47:45,299
so, yeah.

788
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,034
No. Sorry.

789
00:47:47,401 --> 00:47:49,738
Hopefully,
she'll turn back up.

790
00:47:49,804 --> 00:47:53,808
But if she happens to reach out,
do us a favor and call directly.

791
00:47:53,874 --> 00:47:55,209
Okay.

792
00:47:58,445 --> 00:47:59,681
My wife and I are big fans

793
00:47:59,748 --> 00:48:01,014
of Hannah Got a Heart,
by the way.

794
00:48:01,081 --> 00:48:02,817
Oh.
It's a nice show.
It's very funny.

795
00:48:03,283 --> 00:48:05,319
Thank you.
Well, all right.

796
00:48:13,293 --> 00:48:16,029
Honestly,
maybe they're not real cops.

797
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:20,300
They're probably competitors.

798
00:48:20,901 --> 00:48:22,102
I've heard stories--

799
00:48:22,169 --> 00:48:25,406
scams, spies,
trying to scare people into

800
00:48:25,874 --> 00:48:27,609
spilling info
about the procedure.

801
00:48:27,675 --> 00:48:30,444
They've been trying to figure
out our formulation for years,

802
00:48:30,512 --> 00:48:32,346
and they cannot get
the science right,

803
00:48:32,413 --> 00:48:35,015
and I've heard
they've made people sick.

804
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:37,284
Like, deformed. It's...

805
00:48:37,786 --> 00:48:38,853
abhorrent.

806
00:48:39,319 --> 00:48:42,055
These people will do...
They'll do anything.

807
00:48:42,156 --> 00:48:44,458
Gracias.
They seemed like
real cops to me.

808
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:47,127
Well, honey, you can be
overly trusting.

809
00:48:48,929 --> 00:48:50,130
Yeah.

810
00:48:51,098 --> 00:48:52,933
Maybe you could talk
to someone, you know,

811
00:48:53,066 --> 00:48:54,301
find out if Chloe's okay.

812
00:48:54,368 --> 00:48:55,969
It would just...
It would make me feel better.

813
00:48:56,036 --> 00:48:57,404
Consider it done.

814
00:48:59,139 --> 00:49:00,675
Mm. I have to get this.

815
00:49:01,843 --> 00:49:04,978
You. Want to go away
next weekend?

816
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:06,881
St. Barths?

817
00:49:06,947 --> 00:49:09,016
- Mm.
- Hey, I'm on.

818
00:49:09,082 --> 00:49:10,718
How's your cabana boy?

819
00:49:10,819 --> 00:49:12,687
I thought you'd be arrested
by now.

820
00:49:15,255 --> 00:49:17,357
Okay, just don't do anything...

821
00:49:39,046 --> 00:49:40,715
Disarmed.

822
00:49:48,055 --> 00:49:49,223
This is an emergency.

823
00:49:49,490 --> 00:49:52,092
You must connect me with the
city electrical generating...

824
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:38,533
Shit.

825
00:51:43,303 --> 00:51:45,673
Oh, my God.

826
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:47,775
What are you,
hitting the bottle again?

827
00:51:48,076 --> 00:51:51,244
Huh? You a little drunkard?

828
00:51:51,846 --> 00:51:53,246
Okay.

829
00:52:18,205 --> 00:52:22,409
Hello?

830
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:24,545
Sam?
Yeah?

831
00:52:25,647 --> 00:52:27,715
I didn't know who else to call.

832
00:52:28,983 --> 00:52:30,852
Something's really wrong
with me.

833
00:52:31,653 --> 00:52:32,820
Who is this?

834
00:52:34,989 --> 00:52:36,758
They're always watching, Sam.

835
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:39,694
Chloe?

836
00:52:40,762 --> 00:52:41,763
Chloe?

837
00:52:42,329 --> 00:52:45,600
They're always watching.

838
00:53:09,423 --> 00:53:11,059
Sam, what time was the call?

839
00:53:11,159 --> 00:53:13,393
9:00, 9:30?
It was around 9:00.

840
00:53:14,962 --> 00:53:16,329
Yes, on her home phone.

841
00:53:17,598 --> 00:53:19,534
Copy. Yeah.
We can't get around that?

842
00:53:21,769 --> 00:53:22,570
All right, got it.

843
00:53:22,804 --> 00:53:25,338
Yeah, thank you for checking.
All right. Bye.

844
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:27,441
It was a blocked phone number.

845
00:53:27,575 --> 00:53:29,376
So it was probably just
someone prank-calling you.

846
00:53:29,476 --> 00:53:31,746
I don't know, I mean, why would
she have your home phone?

847
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:36,349
You're scratching a lot.
Can I get a coffee?

848
00:53:36,483 --> 00:53:39,286
Sorry, I just didn't sleep
at all last night. Thank you.

849
00:53:43,024 --> 00:53:43,958
Yep.

850
00:54:13,588 --> 00:54:15,523
Sam? Ten-minute warning.

851
00:54:15,790 --> 00:54:17,491
Just a minute, please.

852
00:54:18,993 --> 00:54:20,895
And they're waiting for you
in hair and makeup

853
00:54:20,995 --> 00:54:22,462
whenever you're ready.

854
00:54:24,699 --> 00:54:25,633
Sam?

855
00:54:32,673 --> 00:54:33,841
Hey, sorry.

856
00:54:40,248 --> 00:54:41,849
- Your latte, madam.
- Thank God.

857
00:54:42,415 --> 00:54:46,453
- Do you have any Advil?
- Ooh. Um, I don't,

858
00:54:46,621 --> 00:54:49,289
but I can go ask the medic
if they have any.

859
00:54:49,389 --> 00:54:50,958
Yes, yes. That would be great.

860
00:54:51,025 --> 00:54:52,026
Thank you.
Okay.

861
00:54:52,359 --> 00:54:54,529
Oh, also,
your Vanity Fair interview's

862
00:54:54,629 --> 00:54:55,963
happening like now.
Okay.

863
00:54:56,063 --> 00:54:57,098
He's been waiting for a minute,

864
00:54:57,198 --> 00:54:58,298
so you might want
to go outside...

865
00:54:58,365 --> 00:55:00,034
Can we please just
reschedule that?

866
00:55:02,537 --> 00:55:03,838
Sam, it's Vanity Fair.

867
00:55:11,712 --> 00:55:13,648
Hi. Hey. Um, we're almost ready.

868
00:55:13,714 --> 00:55:15,448
Would you like me to have
wardrobe grab your shorts?

869
00:55:15,550 --> 00:55:19,520
Um, is it a medium?
Uh, a medium and a tight. Yeah.

870
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:21,889
Okay. So, are we gonna see
the shorts on screen or what?

871
00:55:21,989 --> 00:55:23,257
I don't think so, but I...

872
00:55:23,356 --> 00:55:24,625
Well, it doesn't matter,
then, does it?

873
00:55:25,059 --> 00:55:26,994
It's cool, Sam. You can wear
the sweats in this one.

874
00:55:27,094 --> 00:55:28,328
Thank you.

875
00:55:29,329 --> 00:55:31,331
Sammy, Sam, Sam. What's up?
Hey, hey.

876
00:55:31,398 --> 00:55:32,465
All right, here we go.

877
00:55:32,567 --> 00:55:33,734
Let's lock it up. Roll sound.

878
00:55:33,801 --> 00:55:35,636
Seventeen, take one. Marker.

879
00:55:36,571 --> 00:55:39,439
- Okay.
- And action.

880
00:55:41,474 --> 00:55:44,078
So, are you gonna
arrest me or what?

881
00:55:44,946 --> 00:55:46,013
I'm thinking about it.

882
00:55:52,485 --> 00:55:54,288
Now, that's a cut.

883
00:55:54,555 --> 00:55:55,957
All right, we're gonna go again.

884
00:55:56,724 --> 00:55:58,793
Hey, that was really good,
but we need a beat

885
00:55:58,893 --> 00:56:00,595
before the kiss.
I took a beat, yeah?

886
00:56:00,695 --> 00:56:01,963
Right, but a longer beat.

887
00:56:02,063 --> 00:56:04,765
Okay, longer beat.
Just say "longer beat," yeah?

888
00:56:05,766 --> 00:56:08,002
I took a beat.

889
00:56:08,236 --> 00:56:09,837
Yeah. Um, do you mind,
in the kiss,

890
00:56:09,937 --> 00:56:11,706
just a little less
breathing on me?

891
00:56:11,806 --> 00:56:13,241
Because I'm not
feeling too great.

892
00:56:13,373 --> 00:56:15,475
I'm... I'm kissing you.
I got to breathe.

893
00:56:15,543 --> 00:56:16,744
Yeah, that's true. Okay.
Yeah. Yeah.

894
00:56:16,811 --> 00:56:18,246
All right,
we're gonna go again...

895
00:56:18,312 --> 00:56:19,547
It's fine.
...Let's lock it up. Roll sound.

896
00:56:19,614 --> 00:56:21,115
Seventeen, take two. Marker.

897
00:56:21,182 --> 00:56:22,149
Okay.

898
00:56:22,216 --> 00:56:23,985
And action.

899
00:56:24,118 --> 00:56:26,520
Um...

900
00:56:26,721 --> 00:56:29,957
So, uh... so, you gonna
arrest me or what?

901
00:56:30,191 --> 00:56:31,626
I'm thinking about it.

902
00:56:39,934 --> 00:56:44,305
What the fuck? What the fuck?

903
00:56:44,404 --> 00:56:45,773
Did you see that?

904
00:56:45,973 --> 00:56:47,808
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

905
00:56:48,609 --> 00:56:49,911
Was that blood?

906
00:56:50,477 --> 00:56:51,979
Sam?
Sam, you okay?

907
00:56:52,445 --> 00:56:53,681
Sam?

908
00:56:55,016 --> 00:56:56,550
Sam? Sam?

909
00:56:56,884 --> 00:56:58,352
Hi, Samantha.

910
00:56:58,619 --> 00:56:59,987
Simon from Vanity Fair.
Hi.

911
00:57:00,087 --> 00:57:01,555
I was hoping we could
get an interview...

912
00:57:05,226 --> 00:57:06,961
What the fuck?

913
00:57:07,728 --> 00:57:10,164
What is this?
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

914
00:57:10,231 --> 00:57:11,431
I'll get you a towel
in just a...

915
00:57:11,498 --> 00:57:12,867
I'm so sorry.

916
00:57:13,367 --> 00:57:14,602
Please don't print that.

917
00:57:22,410 --> 00:57:24,712
Sam.
No.

918
00:57:25,112 --> 00:57:28,182
Sam. Sam. Sam.

919
00:57:28,448 --> 00:57:29,650
You okay... Do you want me to

920
00:57:29,884 --> 00:57:31,953
get you a medic or something?
No, leave me alone. I'm fine.

921
00:57:32,053 --> 00:57:33,054
Sam.
I'm fine.

922
00:57:41,529 --> 00:57:43,164
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

923
00:57:44,565 --> 00:57:46,267
Sam.

924
00:57:46,466 --> 00:57:47,401
It's Bob.

925
00:57:47,601 --> 00:57:49,203
We just wanna make sure
everything's okay.

926
00:57:49,403 --> 00:57:51,038
I just need some privacy.

927
00:57:51,238 --> 00:57:52,206
Please don't come in.

928
00:57:52,807 --> 00:57:54,608
Sure thing, kid.
Anything you need.

929
00:57:54,675 --> 00:57:55,676
Anything at all.

930
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:03,884
Where is she?

931
00:58:08,422 --> 00:58:09,890
Sammy?
I'm here.

932
00:58:10,992 --> 00:58:11,859
I got your message.

933
00:58:11,993 --> 00:58:14,428
I'm so sorry.
No, no. I'm here, baby girl.

934
00:58:14,695 --> 00:58:16,063
I didn't know what to do.

935
00:58:17,698 --> 00:58:20,001
Zoe, I think something's
really wrong with me.

936
00:58:23,404 --> 00:58:26,640
All right.
We'll take care of that.

937
00:58:27,775 --> 00:58:28,809
We'll take care of that.

938
00:58:28,909 --> 00:58:30,811
Thank you.
Okay. We'll clean it up.

939
00:58:31,812 --> 00:58:32,880
All right?

940
00:58:34,382 --> 00:58:35,816
We'll clean it up.

941
00:58:48,929 --> 00:58:50,798
This is my driver, Cornelius.

942
00:59:09,518 --> 00:59:10,519
I called the clinic.

943
00:59:10,684 --> 00:59:12,253
They're sending someone
right away.

944
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:15,790
Whatever this is, we'll fix it.

945
00:59:16,857 --> 00:59:19,260
Did you speak to Hubert?

946
00:59:19,727 --> 00:59:23,731
No one told you.
Um, he was let go.

947
00:59:24,198 --> 00:59:25,266
Let go? Why?

948
00:59:26,434 --> 00:59:28,769
Some blowup with Brand.
Who the fuck knows?

949
00:59:30,037 --> 00:59:31,972
I'm gonna make you some tea.

950
00:59:32,073 --> 00:59:32,973
Thanks.

951
00:59:33,774 --> 00:59:35,609
Rosa, can you bring us some tea?

952
00:59:35,910 --> 00:59:37,344
Yes, Miss Zoe.
What about Chloe?

953
00:59:37,445 --> 00:59:38,513
Did you hear back about her?

954
00:59:38,579 --> 00:59:39,480
Hmm?

955
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:44,018
The girl who went missing.
Oh, Chloe. Yes. No.

956
00:59:45,052 --> 00:59:49,190
I asked around, and apparently,
she moved to Paris.

957
00:59:51,058 --> 00:59:51,992
Paris?

958
00:59:52,793 --> 00:59:55,196
Some modeling job, I think.
Huh.

959
00:59:56,263 --> 00:59:58,232
Maybe we should reach out
to her directly,

960
00:59:58,766 --> 00:59:59,700
because if the same thing...

961
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:01,869
happened to her...
I'm not gonna call

962
01:00:01,936 --> 01:00:04,839
some random girl in France
that I don't know

963
01:00:04,939 --> 01:00:06,841
just to make you feel better.

964
01:00:08,242 --> 01:00:09,143
Look,

965
01:00:10,377 --> 01:00:11,846
you're freaked out
about your skin.

966
01:00:13,114 --> 01:00:14,048
I get it.

967
01:00:15,749 --> 01:00:17,618
I'm gonna go check on that tea.

968
01:00:53,254 --> 01:00:54,188
Where'd you go?

969
01:00:56,290 --> 01:00:59,260
Sorry,
I just had to use the bathroom.

970
01:01:07,067 --> 01:01:08,035
Try this.

971
01:01:10,304 --> 01:01:11,772
It'll make you feel better.

972
01:01:27,221 --> 01:01:28,155
What?

973
01:01:29,757 --> 01:01:30,891
Don't like it?

974
01:01:31,792 --> 01:01:34,762
No, it's... still hot.

975
01:01:36,964 --> 01:01:38,832
Who'd you call?
Hmm?

976
01:01:39,233 --> 01:01:39,934
Hmm?

977
01:01:40,367 --> 01:01:42,069
When I was in the other room,
I heard you call someone.

978
01:01:42,169 --> 01:01:44,138
Sounds like you called
a couple people.

979
01:01:44,639 --> 01:01:47,741
Unless you were just
talking to yourself.

980
01:01:48,175 --> 01:01:49,176
Oh, maybe.

981
01:01:49,977 --> 01:01:51,879
I'm sorry,
I am a little out of it.

982
01:01:52,246 --> 01:01:54,882
But no, I didn't...
I didn't call anyone.

983
01:01:56,050 --> 01:01:58,018
So, I think that
maybe I should go.

984
01:01:58,118 --> 01:01:59,753
You mind if look at your phone?

985
01:02:01,055 --> 01:02:02,022
What?

986
01:02:03,924 --> 01:02:06,327
Well, I mean, if you
weren't talking to someone,

987
01:02:06,427 --> 01:02:08,395
do you mind if I take a look?

988
01:02:10,030 --> 01:02:12,299
If you're telling the truth,
you can call me a crazy cunt,

989
01:02:12,399 --> 01:02:13,500
and we're done with it.

990
01:02:14,235 --> 01:02:15,670
I want to go to a...

991
01:02:15,903 --> 01:02:17,505
Sam.
I want to go to a doctor.

992
01:02:18,005 --> 01:02:18,939
Honey,

993
01:02:19,674 --> 01:02:22,042
you need to stay here.
No, I'm...

994
01:02:22,109 --> 01:02:24,311
- I want to go to a hospital.
- Take a deep breath.

995
01:02:24,378 --> 01:02:25,312
Take a deep breath.

996
01:02:27,481 --> 01:02:29,250
Why... why are you doing this?

997
01:02:29,783 --> 01:02:30,851
Doing what?

998
01:02:31,252 --> 01:02:33,854
Trying to keep me here.
You sound paranoid.

999
01:02:36,691 --> 01:02:38,660
I'm acting like someone
who cares about you,

1000
01:02:39,226 --> 01:02:40,461
which you probably
don't understand

1001
01:02:40,695 --> 01:02:44,031
because your mother raised you
to feel shitty about yourself.

1002
01:02:44,532 --> 01:02:46,967
Sorry. It's true.

1003
01:02:48,737 --> 01:02:51,939
You need someone you can trust
and who knows.

1004
01:02:52,339 --> 01:02:53,941
I don't know if I do...

1005
01:02:55,809 --> 01:02:57,177
trust you.

1006
01:02:59,413 --> 01:03:01,115
Wow. Okay.

1007
01:03:02,816 --> 01:03:05,219
That's fucking ungrateful.
I'm sorry, I just,

1008
01:03:05,286 --> 01:03:09,056
I know you feel like...
You don't know how I feel,

1009
01:03:09,356 --> 01:03:12,426
and you don't care or you
wouldn't be turning on me.

1010
01:03:12,860 --> 01:03:14,461
Turning on you?
Yeah.

1011
01:03:14,828 --> 01:03:17,632
This isn't about you.
This isn't about me?

1012
01:03:17,931 --> 01:03:20,100
What do you think would happen
if you walked out of here

1013
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:22,369
with these disgusting things
on your body?

1014
01:03:22,870 --> 01:03:24,706
You think that would
help my stock price?

1015
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:28,375
You think that would be good
for my fucking brand?

1016
01:03:29,143 --> 01:03:33,981
You know what they call a woman
trying to improve themselves?

1017
01:03:39,453 --> 01:03:40,588
A punch line.

1018
01:03:43,424 --> 01:03:48,028
Every botched Botox injection
is a cautionary tale.

1019
01:03:48,128 --> 01:03:50,532
"Oh, God, did you see
what they did to her face?

1020
01:03:50,598 --> 01:03:51,700
It's so sad."

1021
01:03:52,132 --> 01:03:54,301
And then, if you let
nature take its course,

1022
01:03:54,536 --> 01:03:58,472
you're dismissed
as "old" and "irrelevant."

1023
01:04:00,575 --> 01:04:02,176
"She aged gracefully."

1024
01:04:03,177 --> 01:04:04,746
Now, that's just
another way of saying,

1025
01:04:05,012 --> 01:04:08,282
"She is wrinkly and unfuckable."

1026
01:04:08,882 --> 01:04:10,752
But we have a solution now.

1027
01:04:10,984 --> 01:04:12,953
We can maintain
our sexual power,

1028
01:04:13,387 --> 01:04:15,289
and we can live
without judgment.

1029
01:04:15,657 --> 01:04:17,559
So I am asking you...

1030
01:04:19,393 --> 01:04:20,361
nicely...

1031
01:04:22,831 --> 01:04:25,065
do not fuck all this up.

1032
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:33,608
Rosa!

1033
01:04:33,708 --> 01:04:34,743
Oh, fuck!

1034
01:05:02,369 --> 01:05:04,037
Get in! Get in!

1035
01:05:06,206 --> 01:05:08,108
Sam, come on! Get in! Get in!

1036
01:05:08,475 --> 01:05:13,548
What is happening? Sam.

1037
01:05:13,648 --> 01:05:15,817
Ow! Ow, fuck.

1038
01:05:16,183 --> 01:05:17,752
Are you okay? Okay.
Go, go, go.

1039
01:05:17,852 --> 01:05:20,789
Go, Lydia. Go!

1040
01:05:20,954 --> 01:05:23,323
Okay, okay.
What the fuck, Sam?

1041
01:05:27,127 --> 01:05:30,164
What is going on?
Fuck.

1042
01:05:30,230 --> 01:05:32,032
Why are there people
chasing you?

1043
01:05:32,499 --> 01:05:35,369
Okay. Oh, fuck.

1044
01:05:36,905 --> 01:05:39,406
What is that?
On your hand. What is that?

1045
01:05:39,541 --> 01:05:40,575
Oh, shit.

1046
01:05:41,041 --> 01:05:43,410
Sam, is that from the treatment?
I don't know.

1047
01:05:44,879 --> 01:05:46,079
You're gonna be okay.

1048
01:05:48,917 --> 01:05:52,219
Was that Zoe's house?
Yeah. Yeah.

1049
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:54,889
That was a cool house.
Yeah, it's really cool.

1050
01:05:54,988 --> 01:05:58,492
Yeah, it was cool.
Fuck.

1051
01:06:01,061 --> 01:06:03,130
Are you sure you don't want me
to go in with you?

1052
01:06:03,197 --> 01:06:04,732
I'll be all right.
Just stay here.

1053
01:06:04,965 --> 01:06:06,133
Okay.

1054
01:06:26,554 --> 01:06:29,824
I'm sorry. I didn't get lunch.
You want to order something?

1055
01:06:30,357 --> 01:06:31,659
What happened to your ankle?

1056
01:06:33,327 --> 01:06:34,762
Have you seen this before?

1057
01:06:35,730 --> 01:06:37,164
Mm.

1058
01:06:39,801 --> 01:06:42,570
I think this has something to do
with why Chloe disappeared.

1059
01:06:42,904 --> 01:06:45,172
And now it's happening to me,
and I'm...

1060
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:47,542
I'm scared that
they're gonna do something

1061
01:06:47,842 --> 01:06:49,109
to try to keep me quiet.

1062
01:06:49,209 --> 01:06:51,111
I need your help...
Slow down. They?

1063
01:06:51,211 --> 01:06:53,715
Yes, Shell. Zoe Shannon.

1064
01:06:54,147 --> 01:06:55,382
"Zoe Shannon," Zoe Shannon?

1065
01:06:55,449 --> 01:06:57,084
What do you think would happen

1066
01:06:57,150 --> 01:06:58,252
if you walked out of here

1067
01:06:58,318 --> 01:07:00,153
with these disgusting things
on your body?

1068
01:07:00,287 --> 01:07:02,122
You think that would
help my stock price...

1069
01:07:02,557 --> 01:07:04,224
Mm-hmm.
...you think that would

1070
01:07:04,291 --> 01:07:06,260
be good for my fucking brand?
Stop the recording.

1071
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:07,060
What?

1072
01:07:07,427 --> 01:07:09,029
You can't record people
without their knowledge.

1073
01:07:09,229 --> 01:07:10,497
California state law.

1074
01:07:11,533 --> 01:07:12,800
Aren't you worried
about the NDA?

1075
01:07:12,901 --> 01:07:16,804
Fuck the NDA. I need a doctor,
and I need protection.

1076
01:07:17,137 --> 01:07:18,272
Just think about this carefully.

1077
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:21,009
Nondisclosure agreements
are a powerful document.

1078
01:07:21,108 --> 01:07:22,577
You know, in fact,
you've already put yourself

1079
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:24,111
at significant legal risk.

1080
01:07:24,211 --> 01:07:26,079
You might want to reconsider.

1081
01:07:26,714 --> 01:07:28,048
You're in a tough spot.

1082
01:07:28,448 --> 01:07:30,618
Don't make things
harder for yourself.

1083
01:07:31,218 --> 01:07:32,452
You work for them.

1084
01:07:32,854 --> 01:07:35,255
Look, we can take you
someplace safe,

1085
01:07:35,657 --> 01:07:37,291
get you help right now.

1086
01:07:38,927 --> 01:07:40,327
All that stuff about Chloe?

1087
01:07:40,494 --> 01:07:42,030
It's true. She's missing,

1088
01:07:42,429 --> 01:07:45,299
and we want to find her
for her own protection.

1089
01:07:45,465 --> 01:07:47,334
Just like we want to help you.

1090
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:17,031
Hi.

1091
01:08:17,130 --> 01:08:19,867
Samantha,
you're sick. Okay?

1092
01:08:19,934 --> 01:08:22,336
I don't really think that
there's much of a choice here,

1093
01:08:22,436 --> 01:08:23,136
is there?

1094
01:08:23,538 --> 01:08:27,008
I mean, given the specificity
of your condition?

1095
01:08:27,374 --> 01:08:29,109
I think we should get you back
to full health,

1096
01:08:29,209 --> 01:08:31,813
and then you can explore
your theories.

1097
01:08:34,616 --> 01:08:35,382
Okay.

1098
01:08:35,482 --> 01:08:37,752
Okay. I'll pay.
You can ride with us.

1099
01:08:45,827 --> 01:08:48,261
I'm just gonna use the bathroom
before we go.

1100
01:08:48,630 --> 01:08:49,463
Mm-hmm.

1101
01:09:01,909 --> 01:09:03,276
Oh, fuck.

1102
01:09:11,619 --> 01:09:12,553
Shit.

1103
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:15,489
Mm. Flores!

1104
01:09:16,658 --> 01:09:17,925
Hey.

1105
01:09:19,393 --> 01:09:20,293
Move!
What the fuck?

1106
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:21,395
Get out of my way!
Taxi2Me.

1107
01:09:21,495 --> 01:09:22,930
Get the fuck
out of the way!

1108
01:09:22,997 --> 01:09:23,898
Taxi2Me!

1109
01:09:24,398 --> 01:09:27,234
- Hey, hey! Hey, hey!
- Stop! Move! Move it!

1110
01:09:32,439 --> 01:09:34,709
Don't know
where she went. You see her?

1111
01:09:34,976 --> 01:09:36,811
Abramson! Over here!

1112
01:09:39,147 --> 01:09:40,581
Hurry up!

1113
01:09:45,019 --> 01:09:48,523
- There she is!
- Oh, fuck. Goddamn it!

1114
01:09:50,658 --> 01:09:51,759
Come on.

1115
01:09:54,327 --> 01:09:55,863
Welcome to Taxi2Me.

1116
01:09:55,930 --> 01:10:00,001
You are in a 25-mile-per-hour
driving zone.

1117
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:01,234
Please buckle up

1118
01:10:01,435 --> 01:10:02,570
for your safety.
Faster. Can you go...

1119
01:10:02,670 --> 01:10:04,304
Excuse me, could you
go faster, please?

1120
01:10:04,371 --> 01:10:05,807
You are in

1121
01:10:05,973 --> 01:10:08,543
a 25-mile-per-hour driving zone.
Go faster, you fucking fuck.

1122
01:10:08,609 --> 01:10:10,210
It sounds like you want

1123
01:10:10,310 --> 01:10:12,680
to submit feedback
about my driving.

1124
01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:13,614
Is that correct?

1125
01:10:13,848 --> 01:10:16,551
Please remain seated
with your seatbelt fastened.

1126
01:10:17,451 --> 01:10:18,351
It appears you are trying

1127
01:10:18,418 --> 01:10:20,253
to use manual drive.
Yes.

1128
01:10:20,755 --> 01:10:22,590
No problem.
You can sign up

1129
01:10:22,690 --> 01:10:23,958
for free using the Taxi2Me app.

1130
01:10:24,058 --> 01:10:25,727
Are you fucking kidding me?

1131
01:10:25,827 --> 01:10:27,327
Please do not
damage the vehicle.

1132
01:10:29,262 --> 01:10:30,430
That's her right there!

1133
01:10:30,531 --> 01:10:31,699
Speed up a little bit.

1134
01:10:32,533 --> 01:10:34,702
Whoa, slow down, slow down.
Right... right there.

1135
01:10:34,802 --> 01:10:37,437
Why are you driving
so fucking slow?

1136
01:10:37,538 --> 01:10:40,307
Hey, pull over. Pull over.

1137
01:10:41,042 --> 01:10:42,409
Pull over!

1138
01:10:42,543 --> 01:10:44,645
Uh, speed up right here.
We can cut her off at the light.

1139
01:10:44,746 --> 01:10:45,980
Prepare to stop.

1140
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:47,615
Traffic light ahead.

1141
01:10:48,381 --> 01:10:49,717
Light, light,
light, light, light!

1142
01:10:52,419 --> 01:10:56,023
Jesus Christ.

1143
01:10:57,892 --> 01:11:00,194
Accident ahead.
Would you like to reroute?

1144
01:11:00,393 --> 01:11:02,563
- You'll save seven minutes.
- What?

1145
01:11:02,697 --> 01:11:04,264
Yes, yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, reroute.

1146
01:11:04,532 --> 01:11:06,134
Rerouting now.

1147
01:11:15,243 --> 01:11:17,444
You lost 2.8 pounds.

1148
01:11:18,746 --> 01:11:21,082
That means you lost 1.12%

1149
01:11:21,149 --> 01:11:26,053
of your body weight, giving you
an overall total of 6.42.

1150
01:11:27,021 --> 01:11:28,388
Alicia, that puts you

1151
01:11:28,623 --> 01:11:30,658
in last place
of the leader board right now.

1152
01:11:31,893 --> 01:11:33,227
You are in jeopardy of being...

1153
01:11:42,937 --> 01:11:43,971
Do you have any ice cream?

1154
01:11:45,372 --> 01:11:46,541
Come on in.

1155
01:11:48,142 --> 01:11:49,644
Whatever's happened to Chloe,

1156
01:11:49,911 --> 01:11:51,045
Zoe knows.

1157
01:11:52,345 --> 01:11:55,750
I know there's something
she's not telling me.

1158
01:11:57,618 --> 01:11:59,419
Sorry, I just, I didn't know
who else to call.

1159
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:03,224
Okay. I don't mean to scare you,
but we don't have much time.

1160
01:12:03,490 --> 01:12:05,026
I got to get you to the clinic.

1161
01:12:05,626 --> 01:12:07,360
And the drive is long,
so let's go.

1162
01:12:07,460 --> 01:12:10,932
Come on.
No. Fuck that. Do it here.

1163
01:12:24,245 --> 01:12:28,049
Painkillers. You'll need 'em.

1164
01:12:47,935 --> 01:12:48,970
All right.

1165
01:12:57,712 --> 01:12:58,779
Here we go.

1166
01:13:04,986 --> 01:13:08,155
This is to help you breathe
and protect your eyes, okay?

1167
01:13:10,558 --> 01:13:11,826
Breathe normally.

1168
01:13:15,763 --> 01:13:18,799
I'm gonna put you in now, okay?
Give me your hand.

1169
01:13:23,671 --> 01:13:24,972
It's okay. It's okay.

1170
01:13:25,072 --> 01:13:27,440
Keep going. Keep going.
We have to do this. Come on.

1171
01:13:28,876 --> 01:13:31,178
It's gonna be a little bit more
than you want.

1172
01:13:31,279 --> 01:13:32,546
Just, you have to sit.

1173
01:13:36,784 --> 01:13:38,219
There you go.

1174
01:13:38,319 --> 01:13:40,254
There you go.
You need to go down.

1175
01:13:40,521 --> 01:13:42,023
You need to go down.
Just go down.

1176
01:13:42,422 --> 01:13:44,592
I'm gonna push you down, okay?

1177
01:13:46,961 --> 01:13:49,196
I'm sorry,
but we have to up the pH levels.

1178
01:13:56,671 --> 01:14:00,775
I know it hurts, Sam. I know
it hurts. No. It's okay, Sam.

1179
01:14:06,113 --> 01:14:08,049
Trust me. It's almost done.

1180
01:14:15,222 --> 01:14:19,360
Breathe. It's okay. Breathe.

1181
01:14:19,794 --> 01:14:22,430
Breathe.
Keep breathing for me, okay?

1182
01:14:22,763 --> 01:14:24,899
It's almost done.
It's working, Sam.

1183
01:14:24,966 --> 01:14:28,035
It's working.

1184
01:15:05,539 --> 01:15:07,842
Oh, I should've knocked.
I'm sorry.

1185
01:15:08,075 --> 01:15:09,643
It's gone.

1186
01:15:11,379 --> 01:15:12,546
Thank you.

1187
01:15:15,950 --> 01:15:19,720
Oh. Just sucks
you don't do sprained ankles.

1188
01:15:20,521 --> 01:15:23,257
This is for you.
Oh. Breakfast in bed.

1189
01:15:23,791 --> 01:15:26,761
All I had to do was grow
a bunch of scales.

1190
01:15:27,728 --> 01:15:29,930
Well, it's good you came
when you did.

1191
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:31,365
Yeah.

1192
01:15:31,599 --> 01:15:33,467
Look, I'm just gonna say it.
I'm really sorry.

1193
01:15:34,235 --> 01:15:36,170
There were a lot of things
I didn't know about

1194
01:15:36,270 --> 01:15:37,405
what they were doing, and...

1195
01:15:37,471 --> 01:15:39,573
kind of talked you
into the treatment.

1196
01:15:39,673 --> 01:15:41,575
I... I just feel, if I knew...
Well, you're right.

1197
01:15:41,675 --> 01:15:44,211
It is all your fault.

1198
01:15:48,082 --> 01:15:49,250
That's coffee.

1199
01:15:49,350 --> 01:15:51,619
Um, I'll be right back.
Okay.

1200
01:16:33,761 --> 01:16:35,596
How do you take your coffee?

1201
01:16:37,698 --> 01:16:39,967
Just take it black, please.
Thank you.

1202
01:16:52,446 --> 01:16:53,981
Oh. Scared me.

1203
01:16:54,281 --> 01:16:55,883
Why do you have
a prescription bottle

1204
01:16:55,950 --> 01:16:57,885
with Chloe Benson's name on it?

1205
01:16:59,286 --> 01:17:00,387
Okay.

1206
01:17:01,590 --> 01:17:03,592
I can explain.
Great.

1207
01:17:04,125 --> 01:17:06,227
I mean,
Chloe was one of my patients,

1208
01:17:07,061 --> 01:17:10,164
and her skin began to calcify,
just like yours,

1209
01:17:11,098 --> 01:17:11,999
and...

1210
01:17:12,733 --> 01:17:14,969
you know,
she came to me for help,

1211
01:17:15,636 --> 01:17:17,304
and we...

1212
01:17:18,639 --> 01:17:20,040
started a relationship.

1213
01:17:21,475 --> 01:17:22,977
Yeah.
Oh.

1214
01:17:23,444 --> 01:17:24,712
I don't know.

1215
01:17:26,581 --> 01:17:28,816
Listen, I know it sounds crazy,
but I love her.

1216
01:17:29,250 --> 01:17:31,785
God help me, I still do,
even now that she's...

1217
01:17:32,853 --> 01:17:35,122
Even now that...
that she's what?

1218
01:17:36,157 --> 01:17:37,858
Okay. I'm sorry.
I can't actually talk

1219
01:17:37,925 --> 01:17:39,293
to you about this, so...

1220
01:17:40,361 --> 01:17:41,962
Did you do something to her?
No.

1221
01:17:42,062 --> 01:17:43,831
I tried everything I can
to stop it,

1222
01:17:43,931 --> 01:17:45,232
but I might have made
things worse.

1223
01:17:45,332 --> 01:17:47,735
I don't actually know. I...
Where is she?

1224
01:17:48,102 --> 01:17:50,004
Stop this for a second.
You can't see her.

1225
01:17:50,671 --> 01:17:53,974
She here?
Sam. Sam, you can't see her.

1226
01:17:54,141 --> 01:17:55,109
Okay?
Chloe?

1227
01:17:55,209 --> 01:17:58,245
You can't... Sam.
Samantha, stop this.

1228
01:17:58,412 --> 01:17:59,880
Chloe?
Come back.

1229
01:18:00,481 --> 01:18:02,950
Sam. Can you just stop
for a second?

1230
01:18:04,051 --> 01:18:05,853
Chloe, can you hear me?

1231
01:18:10,625 --> 01:18:12,159
Chloe?
She can't hear you.

1232
01:18:12,359 --> 01:18:13,060
Chloe.
Stop.

1233
01:18:13,127 --> 01:18:15,262
I'm trying to protect you, okay?

1234
01:18:15,362 --> 01:18:17,298
Hey, just please stop. Stop.

1235
01:18:17,566 --> 01:18:20,801
Just stop, I said. Stop.

1236
01:18:21,001 --> 01:18:22,803
I don't want anyone
to get hurt, okay?

1237
01:18:22,937 --> 01:18:24,271
- Let me go.
- Okay?

1238
01:18:25,973 --> 01:18:29,109
Fuck. Fuck.

1239
01:18:35,482 --> 01:18:37,718
- Chloe?
- Sam!

1240
01:18:42,790 --> 01:18:44,858
I don't know
what they'll do to her.

1241
01:18:45,392 --> 01:18:46,894
- Sam!
- Chloe?

1242
01:18:48,262 --> 01:18:50,931
Sam! Open the door!

1243
01:18:54,536 --> 01:18:57,972
Sam? Open the door.
Open the door.

1244
01:19:16,857 --> 01:19:18,359
Fuck.

1245
01:20:41,643 --> 01:20:43,043
Who are you people?

1246
01:20:44,779 --> 01:20:47,915
Where am I?
My name is Randolph Chan.

1247
01:20:48,015 --> 01:20:50,217
I'm a lawyer
for the Shell Group, and, uh,

1248
01:20:50,484 --> 01:20:53,153
this is Dr. Brand,
our CEO and founder.

1249
01:20:54,488 --> 01:20:57,358
Let me be the first
to say that I am truly sorry

1250
01:20:57,559 --> 01:20:58,859
for what you experienced.

1251
01:20:59,293 --> 01:21:01,730
We were all as shocked
and disturbed as you

1252
01:21:01,830 --> 01:21:03,897
to learn
of Dr. Hubert's actions.

1253
01:21:04,865 --> 01:21:06,967
- Where's Chloe?
- Oh.

1254
01:21:07,067 --> 01:21:09,136
Uh, you'll be pleased to know
she's safe and sound.

1255
01:21:09,503 --> 01:21:12,005
She's, uh, here at the clinic
with our finest doctors,

1256
01:21:12,106 --> 01:21:15,175
where she'll receive
the best medical care she can.

1257
01:21:16,243 --> 01:21:19,046
Under the circumstances.
What happened to her?

1258
01:21:19,514 --> 01:21:23,350
Well, um, like you, uh,
Ms. Benson suffered

1259
01:21:23,450 --> 01:21:26,353
some unfortunate side effects
from her last procedure.

1260
01:21:26,755 --> 01:21:28,389
In certain patients,

1261
01:21:28,489 --> 01:21:33,494
these epidermal calcifications
become somewhat irregular.

1262
01:21:33,628 --> 01:21:36,631
We were very transparent
about the risks involved.

1263
01:21:37,264 --> 01:21:37,965
If you had read

1264
01:21:38,098 --> 01:21:40,067
your nondisclosure
agreement carefully,

1265
01:21:40,167 --> 01:21:41,603
it was right there
in plain English.

1266
01:21:41,703 --> 01:21:43,638
I don't care what it says.

1267
01:21:45,339 --> 01:21:51,145
I will talk... to an attorney.
I will talk to... reporters.

1268
01:21:51,245 --> 01:21:53,914
- Go ahead.
- I... I...

1269
01:21:56,950 --> 01:21:59,386
Lawyer up, Sam. Call the press.

1270
01:21:59,486 --> 01:22:01,756
Let's see where that takes you.
I... I...

1271
01:22:01,890 --> 01:22:05,627
I don't think it's gonna take
you anywhere very lucrative.

1272
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:09,062
Especially considering
that you will not have a career

1273
01:22:09,163 --> 01:22:11,566
to support yourself,
not when we're done with you.

1274
01:22:12,166 --> 01:22:15,269
And then your psoriasis
will return.

1275
01:22:16,270 --> 01:22:20,842
Along with relentless
cell deterioration,

1276
01:22:21,341 --> 01:22:24,311
crow's-feet, saggy skin,
gray hair. Come on.

1277
01:22:24,879 --> 01:22:26,380
On and on and on.

1278
01:22:28,917 --> 01:22:30,585
Um, in...

1279
01:22:31,084 --> 01:22:34,254
anticipation
of your discretion, uh...

1280
01:22:34,689 --> 01:22:36,524
we put together a proposal,

1281
01:22:36,990 --> 01:22:39,293
including a generous
share package

1282
01:22:39,393 --> 01:22:41,863
and life-long treatments
at the clinic, free of charge.

1283
01:22:42,129 --> 01:22:43,765
- No...
- Fuck, Sam.

1284
01:22:43,865 --> 01:22:45,065
Don't be so naive.

1285
01:22:45,365 --> 01:22:48,235
People die every week
on penicillin.

1286
01:22:48,770 --> 01:22:50,471
Every move forward
in medical science

1287
01:22:50,572 --> 01:22:53,407
has consequences,
but the health benefits?

1288
01:22:54,742 --> 01:22:56,443
They're undeniable.

1289
01:22:57,912 --> 01:23:00,347
Is the science perfect?
Not yet.

1290
01:23:01,014 --> 01:23:03,016
But when you want
to make an omelet,

1291
01:23:03,116 --> 01:23:05,152
you got to...
Kill some people?

1292
01:23:09,056 --> 01:23:10,424
Take the offer, Sam.

1293
01:23:11,425 --> 01:23:15,062
You have a chance
to be a strong woman

1294
01:23:16,296 --> 01:23:18,432
achieving full potential.

1295
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:21,636
And you get to look
amazing doing it.

1296
01:23:22,904 --> 01:23:25,172
- Why?
- Because you can, uh,

1297
01:23:25,272 --> 01:23:29,076
realize success. To be accepted.

1298
01:23:30,912 --> 01:23:35,583
Why?
Why what? Stop saying "why."

1299
01:23:35,750 --> 01:23:38,218
Why is it necessary?

1300
01:23:39,286 --> 01:23:40,254
Now you're just being obstinate.

1301
01:23:40,354 --> 01:23:41,789
No, I really want to know.

1302
01:23:42,122 --> 01:23:45,693
Why do I have to care
whether I look amazing or not?

1303
01:23:47,094 --> 01:23:48,495
Oh, Sam.

1304
01:23:51,699 --> 01:23:53,133
Because we're animals.

1305
01:23:55,202 --> 01:23:58,205
There's only so much room
at the top of the food chain.

1306
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:01,375
So you care what you look like

1307
01:24:01,441 --> 01:24:04,712
because how you look
determines who survives.

1308
01:24:05,312 --> 01:24:07,114
And you care, or you wouldn't be

1309
01:24:07,214 --> 01:24:08,783
sitting here right now.
Mm.

1310
01:24:11,553 --> 01:24:14,488
You need me
to believe that, right?

1311
01:24:17,692 --> 01:24:18,760
Because if I didn't,

1312
01:24:19,459 --> 01:24:22,697
or if it...
if it wasn't true, then...

1313
01:24:25,934 --> 01:24:27,100
you'd have nothing.

1314
01:24:33,007 --> 01:24:34,308
Can you even imagine it?

1315
01:24:35,677 --> 01:24:39,514
A life that wasn't
just lived on the surface?

1316
01:24:41,683 --> 01:24:42,617
I bet you can't.

1317
01:24:43,952 --> 01:24:46,153
Zoe Zilt.

1318
01:24:47,055 --> 01:24:48,990
So, in regards
to your little offer...

1319
01:24:49,323 --> 01:24:51,425
...I'm good.

1320
01:24:52,894 --> 01:24:53,895
Thank you.

1321
01:24:54,896 --> 01:24:58,131
I'm going home,
and I'm taking Chloe with me.

1322
01:25:07,407 --> 01:25:09,109
She's not going anywhere.

1323
01:25:16,618 --> 01:25:19,787
Make the call.

1324
01:25:24,491 --> 01:25:26,561
Bring her in.

1325
01:26:07,467 --> 01:26:09,302
I hope
you're not squeamish.

1326
01:26:09,737 --> 01:26:11,039
Hubert's attempt to remedy

1327
01:26:11,105 --> 01:26:14,042
Chloe's symptoms
only accelerated her mutation.

1328
01:26:14,241 --> 01:26:16,544
As with the other
affected patients,

1329
01:26:16,678 --> 01:26:21,015
we see the same pattern
of runaway calcification

1330
01:26:21,181 --> 01:26:22,884
and cell replication.

1331
01:26:23,450 --> 01:26:28,556
But in this unique case,
the growths are so extensive,

1332
01:26:28,790 --> 01:26:32,894
the new enzymes have overpowered
her cellular structure.

1333
01:26:33,594 --> 01:26:37,699
She's no longer human.
She's something more...

1334
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,367
crustacean.

1335
01:26:46,741 --> 01:26:48,843
I think we can both agree
that she...

1336
01:26:49,911 --> 01:26:51,679
Chloe needs to stay here.

1337
01:26:52,345 --> 01:26:53,981
At the clinic,
where she's receiving

1338
01:26:54,082 --> 01:26:55,583
expert medical attention.

1339
01:26:59,821 --> 01:27:00,922
Chloe?

1340
01:27:19,907 --> 01:27:21,943
That glass doesn't break, right?

1341
01:27:28,683 --> 01:27:29,717
Oh, fuck!

1342
01:28:32,479 --> 01:28:35,448
Shit.

1343
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:48,629
Shit.

1344
01:28:53,167 --> 01:28:54,869
Sam!

1345
01:28:55,303 --> 01:28:56,838
Sam! Sam!

1346
01:28:57,305 --> 01:29:00,975
Open it. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1347
01:29:01,075 --> 01:29:02,910
I thought you forgot
all about me.

1348
01:29:03,010 --> 01:29:04,444
No, of course not.

1349
01:29:04,545 --> 01:29:06,346
Are you okay?

1350
01:29:06,479 --> 01:29:08,716
No, I'm not fucking okay!
All right. Stupid question.

1351
01:29:08,783 --> 01:29:10,284
Okay, so we have to
get out of here

1352
01:29:10,350 --> 01:29:11,886
because Chloe turned
into a giant lobster

1353
01:29:12,019 --> 01:29:13,788
and she's running around
trying to kill everybody.

1354
01:29:14,822 --> 01:29:15,823
What?

1355
01:29:17,024 --> 01:29:18,893
Shit.

1356
01:29:23,396 --> 01:29:24,599
Come on, come on.

1357
01:29:29,670 --> 01:29:31,105
Where do you ladies
think you're going?

1358
01:29:33,007 --> 01:29:34,976
Oh, give it a fucking rest, Zoe.

1359
01:29:35,776 --> 01:29:39,947
But, Sam... the optics.

1360
01:29:54,427 --> 01:29:56,496
Samantha.

1361
01:29:57,497 --> 01:29:58,799
It hurts me...

1362
01:30:00,134 --> 01:30:01,936
when you turn on me like this.

1363
01:30:04,272 --> 01:30:05,806
I saw myself in you.

1364
01:30:07,141 --> 01:30:09,977
Sure, I'm taller, I'm richer,

1365
01:30:10,611 --> 01:30:13,748
I have better business acumen
and upper arm definition.

1366
01:30:17,118 --> 01:30:18,886
But we wanted the same thing.

1367
01:30:19,486 --> 01:30:23,557
A friend, a gal pal,
someone to confide in.

1368
01:30:24,825 --> 01:30:27,895
You know it was me, right,
who got you cast in that movie?

1369
01:30:28,829 --> 01:30:33,768
No one would hire you,
not even after the treatments.

1370
01:30:35,736 --> 01:30:39,240
And I felt bad.
I had pity for you

1371
01:30:39,340 --> 01:30:42,176
because your life,
it's just so pathetic.

1372
01:30:44,912 --> 01:30:47,048
I should have known
you weren't built a winner.

1373
01:30:48,416 --> 01:30:49,583
Mm.

1374
01:30:51,451 --> 01:30:54,588
You think I just had
all of this handed to me?

1375
01:30:56,190 --> 01:30:58,025
You got to take it.

1376
01:31:00,027 --> 01:31:02,029
How's that
for upper arm definition?

1377
01:31:58,886 --> 01:32:01,922
Oh, fuck.

1378
01:32:13,868 --> 01:32:15,603
Oh! Sam!

1379
01:32:15,770 --> 01:32:19,707
System on.

1380
01:32:24,345 --> 01:32:25,579
Sam!

1381
01:32:33,087 --> 01:32:34,155
Sam!

1382
01:33:24,872 --> 01:33:25,840
Sam.

1383
01:33:27,341 --> 01:33:29,376
Sam, come... Come on, Sam.

1384
01:33:41,355 --> 01:33:42,656
You should've called me.

1385
01:33:43,525 --> 01:33:44,959
I didn't want to scare you, Mom.

1386
01:33:45,459 --> 01:33:48,229
You can call your mother
anytime,

1387
01:33:48,597 --> 01:33:50,197
no matter what happens.

1388
01:33:51,065 --> 01:33:52,032
Thanks, Mom.

1389
01:33:52,366 --> 01:33:54,301
Aw.

1390
01:33:54,668 --> 01:33:56,504
I'm gonna go find that nurse.

1391
01:33:56,804 --> 01:33:59,140
And a stiff drink.

1392
01:34:01,041 --> 01:34:01,942
So funny.

1393
01:34:02,276 --> 01:34:05,079
That, of course, was a scene
from Hannah Got a Heart,

1394
01:34:05,179 --> 01:34:07,148
the show that
first introduced us

1395
01:34:07,214 --> 01:34:09,650
to the incomparable
Samantha Lake.

1396
01:34:09,750 --> 01:34:10,684
Let's start with the book,

1397
01:34:11,051 --> 01:34:14,121
Skin Deep, The Rise and Fall
of a Cosmetic Empire.

1398
01:34:14,221 --> 01:34:16,157
I know there are various
lawsuits that still

1399
01:34:16,257 --> 01:34:18,125
need to play out,
but tell us about it.

1400
01:34:18,225 --> 01:34:21,428
I truly hope that
my story and this book

1401
01:34:21,695 --> 01:34:25,266
can serve as
a cautionary tale and...

1402
01:34:26,033 --> 01:34:29,436
I don't know, maybe give people
a little bit of hope.

1403
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:34,509
Does it surprise you

1404
01:34:34,708 --> 01:34:37,244
that Shell continues to be
a successful business?

1405
01:34:38,078 --> 01:34:39,680
People want to look good.

1406
01:34:39,914 --> 01:34:40,814
- Right?
- Yeah.

1407
01:34:40,881 --> 01:34:43,518
I get it. So do I.

1408
01:34:43,585 --> 01:34:45,620
It's no longer
the most important thing

1409
01:34:45,819 --> 01:34:47,254
to me in my life.
Mm.

1410
01:34:47,321 --> 01:34:51,325
And...
I'm a lot happier for it.
