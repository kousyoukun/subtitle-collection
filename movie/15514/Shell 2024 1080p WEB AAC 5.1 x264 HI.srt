Such a great instinct.

164
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:53,060
We got it, though.
SAMANTHA: Maybe just...

165
00:09:53,127 --> 00:09:54,462
Should I...
Do you want one more?

166
00:09:54,529 --> 00:09:55,930
I'm happy to just do one more,
if you want.

167
00:09:55,996 --> 00:09:57,198
CASTING DIRECTOR:
You know what? I...
(SIGHS)

168
00:09:57,298 --> 00:09:58,833
I thought it was great.
SAMANTHA: Great. Awesome.

169
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:00,134
PRODUCER: Perfect. Thank you.
SAMANTHA: Okay.

170
00:10:00,201 --> 00:10:01,503
Thanks so much.
Good to see you.

171
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:02,837
CASTING DIRECTOR:
Thank you, Sam. Great stuff.

172
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:04,438
(CHUCKLES)
PRODUCER: Good actor,

173
00:10:04,672 --> 00:10:06,407
but you'd never get
the studio to sign off.

174
00:10:06,474 --> 00:10:08,676
She's what, 40-something?
CASTING DIRECTOR: I know.

175
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:10,478
I was just thinking
the same thing.

176
00:10:10,945 --> 00:10:12,246
PRODUCER: Do you want
to grab some lunch?

177
00:10:12,313 --> 00:10:13,814
I'm gonna have Benji
go get something for us.

178
00:10:13,881 --> 00:10:15,382
CASTING DIRECTOR:
I want you to take a look

179
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:16,684
at this next girl, Chloe Benson.

180
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,620
She's a tad young for the role,
but stunning.

181
00:10:19,687 --> 00:10:21,523
She just tested for, uh...
SAMANTHA: Hey, guys,

182
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,858
I'm so sorry, just,
I forgot my... my phone.

183
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:26,193
Okay. Really great to see you.
Thank you.

184
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,461
CASTING DIRECTOR:
Good to see you...

185
00:10:27,562 --> 00:10:28,696
(RECORDING STOPS)
(CHUCKLES, SNIFFLES)

186
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:30,131
BRETT: You.

187
00:10:30,197 --> 00:10:31,932
You are so fucking good.

188
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:33,667
You know that?
"Singular Samantha."

189
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:35,436
BRETT: They're going another way
on the movie, but...

190
00:10:35,504 --> 00:10:37,104
Who got it?
BRETT: Uh... (STAMMERS)

191
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:38,772
I don't think they made
that call yet.

192
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:41,775
AUDREY: They're looking
at someone who is, um...

193
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:42,977
Less experienced.

194
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:45,412
(LAUGHING) Oh. So, younger?

195
00:10:45,514 --> 00:10:47,582
Fresh face.
Right, well, the character

196
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:48,983
is a divorced
single mother of two,

197
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:51,051
so I don't know how young
they can go, but...

198
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:53,087
Um, well, look,

199
00:10:53,154 --> 00:10:56,290
I'm glad we're here because
I wanted to talk to you guys.

200
00:10:56,357 --> 00:10:58,425
I may not even be...
This is a very
competitive landscape,

201
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:01,061
and I've always tried
to be honest with you.

202
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:04,431
You've never really gone
for the nips or tucks,

203
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:05,833
and I get that.

204
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,835
I respect it.
Thank you.

205
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:11,472
And I can say this to you,
woman-to-woman.

206
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:13,073
With all the
developments lately,

207
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,309
we're seeing new demands
on talent to meet...

208
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:18,946
enhanced standards.
To meet an expectation.

209
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,314
Wow. Okay.

210
00:11:20,381 --> 00:11:22,883
AUDREY: Nobody's asking you
to lose weight.

211
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:25,152
BRETT: Mm. Mm-mm.
I love that you have a...

212
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:28,889
I love that you don't have
a traditional body type.

213
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,158
We need more women like you.

214
00:11:31,626 --> 00:11:33,127
Thank you.
BRETT: I love it, too.

215
00:11:33,227 --> 00:11:34,428
Just for the record.

216
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:36,063
We want you to consider

217
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:38,667
some treatment options.
BRETT: Oh, yeah. Yeah.

218
00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:41,001
What about the Shell clinic?
Oh, yes.

219
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:42,836
BRETT: Yes.
Sorry, what about it?

220
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:44,772
BRETT: Yeah, we represent
them now for branding.

221
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:46,473
We can have the office
set something up.

222
00:11:47,074 --> 00:11:47,875
Oh, I...

223
00:11:48,309 --> 00:11:50,411
Thank you, but I don't know
if I'm... I'm there yet.

224
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:53,347
Maybe down the line...
Everybody does something.

225
00:11:53,414 --> 00:11:54,549
There's no shame in it.
Right.

226
00:11:54,616 --> 00:11:57,318
Give it a shot.
And if it doesn't work,

227
00:11:57,718 --> 00:12:00,421
well, it doesn't work.

228
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:03,991
SAMANTHA: Okay, uh, yeah,
I mean, I'll think about it.

229
00:12:04,358 --> 00:12:06,393
(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)

230
00:12:28,015 --> 00:12:29,917
SAMANTHA: (PANTING)
What do you know about Shell?

231
00:12:30,784 --> 00:12:32,086
I know it works.

232
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,623
Do you remember Jen Bryer
from seventh grade?

233
00:12:34,689 --> 00:12:35,657
Yeah.

234
00:12:35,724 --> 00:12:37,024
I saw her at Gelson's last week.

235
00:12:37,358 --> 00:12:39,460
Looked like she was still
in seventh grade.

236
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:43,097
Isn't it kind of like,
I don't know, un-feminist?

237
00:12:44,098 --> 00:12:46,867
Zoe Shannon's, like,
the richest woman in America.

238
00:12:47,101 --> 00:12:49,937
And she looks fucking hot.

239
00:12:50,838 --> 00:12:53,140
That's feminist as fuck.
I thought you hated her.

240
00:12:54,008 --> 00:12:55,510
I mean, everyone has
to say they hate her,

241
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:58,445
but, like, obviously obsessed.
SAMANTHA: (EXHALES) Yeah.

242
00:12:59,113 --> 00:13:00,615
Do you want to get
a drink after this?

243
00:13:00,682 --> 00:13:02,049
I can't.
I have that date tonight.

244
00:13:02,316 --> 00:13:04,785
LYDIA: With who? Tattoo guy?
Yeah.

245
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:07,254
LYDIA: Hot.
Oh, yeah.

246
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:10,525
DEVIN: So, with the IPO...

247
00:13:10,659 --> 00:13:11,693
That's "initial
public offering."

248
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:13,060
SAMANTHA: Mm-hmm.
DEVIN: That's what that means.

249
00:13:13,127 --> 00:13:15,062
Uh, we're probably gonna be
moving forward.

250
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:17,599
And most importantly,
I'm gonna pay back my dad.

251
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:18,966
SERVER: I'll take this for you.

252
00:13:19,033 --> 00:13:20,801
Thank you.
(CHUCKLES)

253
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:23,470
That's amazing.
Yeah, you...

254
00:13:24,773 --> 00:13:26,508
A little something in...
What? What is it? Oh.

255
00:13:26,574 --> 00:13:27,742
DEVIN: Yeah.
Oh, really? Oh.

256
00:13:28,075 --> 00:13:29,910
Oh, is it... oh, God.

257
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:31,680
(CHUCKLES) Don't look.

258
00:13:31,746 --> 00:13:33,113
(BOTH LAUGH)

259
00:13:33,515 --> 00:13:34,716
Is it gone?
DEVIN: Yeah.

260
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:36,950
Thanks.
DEVIN: Yeah.
Yeah, no, you got it.

261
00:13:38,152 --> 00:13:40,921
Hey, so you look
so familiar to me.

262
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:43,692
What is it that you...
you do again for a living?

263
00:13:43,758 --> 00:13:44,958
Oh, I'm an actress.

264
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:46,493
DEVIN: No way.
Yeah.

265
00:13:46,561 --> 00:13:47,361
Mostly television.

266
00:13:47,461 --> 00:13:48,896
I knew... I knew
that I recognized you.

267
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:50,831
SAMANTHA: Really?
Yes. Absolutely.

268
00:13:50,898 --> 00:13:52,199
What... what have I seen you in?

269
00:13:52,266 --> 00:13:54,769
Oh, probably nothing.
DEVIN: Well?

270
00:13:55,503 --> 00:13:58,673
Uh, I was on a show that was
quite popular for a while.

271
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,374
It was called
Hannah Got a Heart.

272
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,812
Oh, yeah, no, I know that show.

273
00:14:03,877 --> 00:14:06,313
Uh, the girl
with the talking heart.

274
00:14:06,648 --> 00:14:07,682
SAMANTHA: Yes.
Yeah.

275
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:09,784
SAMANTHA: The previous
heart's owner talked to her.

276
00:14:10,084 --> 00:14:11,619
(LAUGHS SOFTLY) Hilarious.
(SAMANTHA CHUCKLES)

277
00:14:11,686 --> 00:14:13,220
What was that like?
SAMANTHA: Oh...

278
00:14:13,287 --> 00:14:14,955
Uh, it was the first pilot
I ever did

279
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:16,725
that got picked up,
so that was good. (CHUCKLES)

280
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:18,092
Then I got to work
with all these

281
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:19,527
really experienced
people, and...

282
00:14:19,627 --> 00:14:21,730
But, I mean, it was a bad show.

283
00:14:21,796 --> 00:14:23,665
(LAUGHS)
DEVIN: (CHUCKLES) Right?

284
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:27,769
Oh, um, well, no, it's...
cheesy, yeah, for sure.

285
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:30,672
But I got to do
what I loved, so...
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

286
00:14:30,739 --> 00:14:32,139
Yeah, but it was a bad show.

287
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:34,108
Why would you want to be
on a bad show?

288
00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:35,943
Yeah.

289
00:14:37,444 --> 00:14:38,580
I liked it.

290
00:14:45,953 --> 00:14:48,455
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

291
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:50,290
I had a really
good time tonight.

292
00:14:50,924 --> 00:14:52,426
Really?
Yeah.

293
00:14:52,493 --> 00:14:53,728
Oh.

294
00:14:53,828 --> 00:14:55,195
Well, I had a nice time, too.

295
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:57,030
(LAUGHS SOFTLY)
Good.

296
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:13,615
(LAUGHS)

297
00:15:19,888 --> 00:15:21,689
(GRUNTS)
Oh, sorry.

298
00:15:21,756 --> 00:15:23,691
Did you, um, feel that?
It's just, um...

299
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:25,426
I have psoriasis.

300
00:15:26,193 --> 00:15:28,028
It's kind of embarrassing.
It's not contagious or anything.

301
00:15:28,162 --> 00:15:29,831
Oh.
(LAUGHS) Yeah.

302
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,465
Sometimes when it rains,
it flares up a little.

303
00:15:31,533 --> 00:15:33,835
Oh, that's... that's cool.
SAMANTHA: Yeah.

304
00:15:33,902 --> 00:15:35,804
Is it?
Yeah, no, I just, um...

305
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:38,238
It's not, like, all over
my body or anything.
DEVIN: For sure.

306
00:15:38,305 --> 00:15:40,007
It's, like, in certain spots.
Yeah. (CLEARS THROAT)

307
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:41,810
Yeah, no, actually,
I just, um...

308
00:15:41,876 --> 00:15:43,210
I have to be up pretty early
tomorrow, so...

309
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:44,913
Oh, you... you do?
Yeah.

310
00:15:44,978 --> 00:15:46,113
Yeah. Um...
Okay.

311
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,015
So...
All right. That's fine.

312
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:50,518
Yeah. Yeah.
Maybe some...

313
00:15:50,785 --> 00:15:51,985
other time?
(EXHALES SHARPLY) Yeah.

314
00:15:52,052 --> 00:15:53,555
Okay.
Totally. Would love that.

315
00:15:53,655 --> 00:15:54,789

Oh. I'm...

812
00:41:47,441 --> 00:41:49,810
I don't know.
Yes. He is age-appropriate.

813

way better than me.

you're not that funny...
