1
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,360
All patrolling air units.

2
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:34,330
A 208 is in progress in the
C-13 district of Newport City.

3
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:37,590
Airspace over this area
will be closed. Repeat:

4
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:39,270
All patrolling air units.

5
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,660
A 208 is in progress in the
C-13 district of Newport City.

6
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:46,110
Airspace over this area
will be closed. Repeat:

7
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:47,610
All patrolling air units.

8
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:52,090
A 208 is in progress in the
C-13 district of Newport City ...

9
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,960
There's no need for concern. Our country
is quite capable of covering its tracks.

10
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,860
That's why you need me, right?

11
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,660
Depends on how you look at it.
At any rate, any program has its bugs ...

12
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,260
... and I would think that a man of
your capability could cure our problem.

13
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,010
You don't understand. We aren't even sure
that Project 2501 really is a bug.

14
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,390
Originally, the purpose
of this project was to ...

15
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:38,160
Major Kusanagi, Section 6 is in position
and ready to move in.

16
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,110
- Major, are you there?
- Yeah, I heard you.

17
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:45,760
I'm surprised you can hear anything.
What's with all the noise in your brain today?

18
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:47,530
Must be a loose wire.

19
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,310
Don't you think there's gonna be trouble later
if Section 9 interferes with Section 6?

20
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,910
If Section 6 manages to catch the bastard,
then all they can really do about it is deport him.

21
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,310
Don't forget, we're Section 9.
We'll clean it up.

22
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:10,420
We're the ones who
get our hands dirty.

23
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:13,270
It's time now. Let's move
to the rendezvous point.

24
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,760
- What? The police? Here?
- Huh?

25
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:04,760
Stop it! Who told you to fire?
Put your guns down now!

26
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:05,760
Freeze!

27
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,110
Get your hands up!

28
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:12,740
I'm entitled to diplomatic immunity.
I want to talk to the person in charge here.

29
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:17,710
Taking classified programmers out of
the country compromises national security.

30
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:21,140
We can also have you brought up
on kidnapping charges.

31
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,560
You have no choice.
Let him go.

32
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:29,040
Not possible. Mr. Daita wants political asylum
from us, and we have his signed affidavit.

33
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,690
- What?
- I don't have to explain.

34
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,610
My country has the right,
in accordance with international law ...

35
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,410
... to offer anyone protection
and safe passage.

36
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:41,940
The affidavit is at the embassy.
I'll send you a copy in a couple of days.

37
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:46,370
- Daita, you'll be killed if you return.
- I'm warning you to watch your comments!

38
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:48,440
Our country is a peace-loving democracy.

39
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,890
Of course it is!

40
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:50,760
Huh?

41
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,460
The window! Shoot!

42
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,260
Huh?

43
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:08,260
I don't believe it.
Therm-optic camouflage.

44
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:54,260
Hello, Aramaki.
This is quite a surprise.

45
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:59,800
So, what business brings the chief of Section 9
to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs?

46
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,260
I need to ask you about the secret talks
scheduled with the Gavel Republic tomorrow.

47
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:10,030
Procedure, of course. Well, the regime that took over
Gavel after the revolution demands financial aid ...

48
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,230
... supposedly for redevelopment.

49
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:15,260
They boast democracy, but they're
no better than the last lot.

50
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,560
Now they feel entitled to funds, because
of our past exploitation. No gratitude.

51
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,470
What's the Ministry going to do?

52
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,720
Well, there's a problem. The leader of
the former junta that controlled their country ...

53
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,740
... is here, seeking political asylum.

54
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,940
You mean Colonel Malles, correct?

55
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,650
Yes, and that means we either
deny Gavel the funds ...

56
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:36,060
... and treat Malles as a
political refugee, or help them.

57
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,980
And kick him out!

58
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:42,510
Personally, I'm inclined to deport him,
forcibly, if necessary ...

59
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:46,330
... but I'd have to come up with a
politically acceptable reason for it.

60
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:57,750
By the way, I want to thank you for your help
with that other political asylum situation.

61
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:00,260
Nakamura from Section 6
wasn't so grateful.

62
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:05,050
But you realize that we in the diplomat
business must avoid messy situations.

63
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,300
Access.

64
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:14,410
We've lost response.
What's happened to the EEG output?

65
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,800
It's normal.
I'll switch to Simex mode.

66
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:23,350
In case you haven't been briefed,
this is the minister's interpreter.

67
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:27,040
Twenty-three minutes ago, her brain
was hacked into through a data line.

68
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,760
Foreign intelligence
warned us about this.

69
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:35,030
A hacker called the "Puppet Master" has begun
to infiltrate terminals throughout our network.

70
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,200
We believe it's extremely likely
that he'll target the secret talks ...

71
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,550
... that are scheduled
with the Republic of Gavel.

72
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:44,350
As a precaution, we've put everyone
attending the talks under surveillance.

73
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:47,140
It's my suspicion that once
he hacked into her ghost ...

74
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,830
... he'd use her to assassinate
the key delegates.

75
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:53,300
So how much time do we have before this
hacker breaks through her barrier program ...

76
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,800
... and reaches her ghost?

77
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,320
Roughly two hours. He's using
an old-fashioned HA-3 virus.

78
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:01,780
After that, we'll have to break the
connection to avoid any danger to the system.

79
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:07,000
Batou and Ishikawa are tracking the signal source
from their car. Contact them.

80
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,750
You know, I don't know what's going on.
Mind filling me in, Major?

81
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:28,870
Are we talking about the Puppet Master,
the infamous mystery hacker?

82
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:33,480
Well, we don't know a lot either.
No clue about age, sex or background.

83
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,010
We think that he or she is American ...

84
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:38,730
... and it's the first time
he's known to show up here.

85
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:42,790
All we know for certain is, this person is
on the international most wanted list ...

86
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:47,960
... for crimes including stock manipulation,
illegal information gathering ...

87
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,380
... political engineering,
several acts of terrorism.

88
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,520
So why the nickname?

89
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,180
The nickname "Puppet Master"
comes from the ghost hacking.

90
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:59,090
Well, if he's so skilled, how come
he's using an outdated HA-3 virus?

91
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:03,410
Think about it a minute. You have to figure
he's either covering his tracks or decoying us.

92
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,820
Even though a more current technique
would be harder to trace ...

93
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,740
... it might also arouse suspicion about
Colonel Malles' role in this affair.

94
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,630
Are you saying that's the reason
he's using an old method?

95
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,920
Just so no one
would suspect Malles?

96
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:19,180
Or maybe this is all an elaborate ruse
to make us think in that direction.

97
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,620
There's always a chance that
Malles is a pawn in this setup.

98
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,880
Now you're stretching it.
It's not like you have any hard evidence.

99
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,640
Nope. No evidence.

100
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:34,020
Just a whisper.
I hear it in my ghost.

101
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:37,060
Which reminds me, are you
still using that revolver?

102
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,810
You should stop worrying
about the automatics jamming up.

103
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,890
I like my Matever!

104
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:46,480
Well, effective stopping power is more
important than your preference in guns.

105
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,850
Since it's my ass on the line
out there, use the Zastaber.

106
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,520
Yes, Major.

107
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,580
There's something I've wanted
to ask ever since I started.

108
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,850
Why did you transfer a guy
like me from the police force?

109
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,710
Because we need a guy like you.

110
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:00,540
Huh?

111
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,400
Number one: you're an honest cop.
Number two: you've never stepped out of line.

112
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,770
Three: you're a family man.
And, except for the slight brain augmentation ...

113
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,050
... your body's almost completely human.

114
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,000
If we all reacted the same way,
we'd be predictable.

115
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,890
And there's always more than
one way to view a situation.

116
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:19,240
What's true for the group
is also true for the individual.

117
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:25,280
It's simple. Over-specialize and you
breed in weakness. It's slow death.

118
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:39,080
- Damn it, come on!
- I'll be right there!

119
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,660
Oh, for Christ's sake, we're already
40 seconds late! Will you hurry it up?

120
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,530
Hang on, I'm almost done.

121
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:51,060
It's gonna be one of those days.

122
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:58,090
Hey. Sorry, pal.

123
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:00,760
My last partner got busted
working as an illegal alien.

124
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,340
Couldn't speak English, but he
was a lot better than you are.

125
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:10,540
So, what are you trying to find out so bad
you gotta ghost-hack into your wife's mind for, huh?

126
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:14,900
My wife never has any time.
Now, all of a sudden, she wants a divorce.

127
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,010
And to make matters worse,
my daughter, my only kid ...

128
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:20,540
... got it in her head that
I'm the one cheating on her mom.

129
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,840
What I don't get is, how did you
get your hands on a barrier breaker?

130
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:28,620
From this really nice fella.
I was in a bar, and he overheard my sob story.

131
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,410
I mentioned that my wife's lawyer stopped me
from seeing her and my daughter.

132
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:37,010
He must have felt sorry, because he showed me how
to hack in from different places along the route.

133
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,630
It's hard to trace.

134
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,700
Asshole! Do you think
you own the damn road?

135
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,990
It looks like we're not the only ones
who are in a hurry around here.

136
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,170
Nothing. Shit!

137
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,160
What's the point in us
breaking our butts?

138
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:59,170
Every time we get to the source
they're already long gone.

139
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:02,050
- We're just wasting our time.
- Don't quit yet.

140
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:07,420
Kusanagi and Togusa are heading to the next area
the hacker's expected to access from. Stay alert.

141
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,460
- What are we looking for, Chief?
- Anything.

142
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:15,980
- Like I said, a waste of time.
- Damn it all to hell!

143
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,300
Oh, shit. I missed him!

144
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,510
Hey, Pop. Did you see anyone
using the phone over here?

145
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,850
So, who wants to know?

146
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:25,180
Just answer me.
Did you see someone or not?

147
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,290
Yeah, I saw the trashman
making a call ...

148
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:31,770
... so I thought I had enough time
to bring my garbage down.

149
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:37,320
Hey! Can't you take this for me?

150
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:41,690
A trash truck? Clever.
It changes location every seven minutes.

151
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:46,050
HQ, patch me target info
from the district controlling that truck.

152
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,770
Eight refuse collection vehicles are
on duty in the surveillance area.

153
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:03,770
Target is number 58,
a type C vehicle.

154
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,540
Give me the wheel.

155
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:19,230
Ishikawa, go check out
the trash collectors' homes.

156
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:21,510
Batou, cut the truck off
at its next stopping point.

157
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:23,610
It's possible they've come
into contact with someone.

158
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:26,260
Follow them,
but take no action. Got it?

159
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,470
We've got the data
on the refuse collection points.

160
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:34,040
All points correspond to those
locations where we traced back the calls.

161
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,480
The target has now stopped
at the next point.

162
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,820
HA-3 access confirmed.

163
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:47,500
Hey, how about if I pick up the trash on the
second half of our round, and you make the calls?

164
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,450
Well?

165
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,260
Ain't no way I'm gonna
be your partner in crime.

166
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,120
It's your wife, you handle her.

167
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:57,930
- Tell me, you got any children of your own?
- You must be kidding.

168
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:02,250
Then I guess you can't understand how
a father would feel about his little girl.

169
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:05,410
She's my beautiful,
precious angel. See?

170
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:08,510
Get away. I'm not interested
in crap like that.

171
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:14,030
Yeah, vehicle 58.
Yeah, what can I ...

172
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,260
What's that?

173
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:18,500
What do the cops
want to know our rounds for?

174
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,490
How would I know?
Why are you asking me?

175
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:28,370
Oh, my God, they found out!
That guy who helped me, I've got to warn him.

176
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,360
Listen, we're gonna have
to pass up the next pickup.

177
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,110
What?

178
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,470
Target has deviated from route ...

179
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:35,620
... and is heading to our next designated
point at increased speed.

180
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,730
It wasn't me. There's no way
I could have been spotted.

181
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:42,680
They probably traced me when I accessed
the Sanitation Department network.

182
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,430
Next time, use the back door.

183
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,540
Forget that now.
Just arrest them.

184
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,110
- You can drive now.
- Huh?

185
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,880
Whoa!

186
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:23,540
Hey! They know!

187
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:59,650
Christ! What the hell's he
using? That van was armored.

188
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,900
Watch it. He's got high velocity bullets.
Your car door won't stop them.

189
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,580
HV ammo in a submachine pistol?
He's insane!

190
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,890
This guy's even wearing
some kind of therm-optics.

191
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:25,660
Keep on his tail.
I'll come around from the top.

192
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:31,260
Togusa! If you're still alive, get off
your ass and arrest those garbage men.

193
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,020
Affirmative.

194
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:37,490
Yes, sirree,
the excitement never stops.

195
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:31,710
Hey!

196
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,890
Police! Everybody get down!

197
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:39,620
Shit!

198
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,660
Get out of the fucking way!

199
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:29,830
Hm?

200
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,410
Aw, out of ammo?

201
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:40,200
Huh?

202
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,650
Got him, huh?

203
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:38,180
Well, the breech and the barrel
are really screwed up.

204
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:42,200
That's what happens when you use HV bullets
in one of these things. Oh yeah.

205
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:45,970
It's no use arresting me.
I'm not talking to any goddamn cops!

206
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:47,910
Talk?

207
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:51,570
And just what are you gonna talk about?

208
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:54,800
You don't even know your own name,
you stupid dick-head!

209
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,520
Huh?

210
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,290
Can you remember your mother's
name or what she looks like?

211
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:02,700
Or how about
where you were born?

212
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,030
Don't you have any
happy childhood memories?

213
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:10,040
Do you even know who you are?

214
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,420
Ghost-hacked humans are so pathetic.
It's a shame.

215
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,010
And this poor bastard's
been hacked pretty badly.

216
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:38,510
We'll enter after the passengers
have gone into the building.

217
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:42,340
Squad B comes in from the rear,
and the rest of you go through the front.

218
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:46,730
Saito, have some of your men unplug
all cars parked in front of the house.

219
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:49,380
Begin recording.

220
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:55,330
Chief, a message for you
from Headquarters.

221
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:57,940
Batou here. We've ID'ed
the man the Major caught.

222
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:58,800
So who is he?

223
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,650
He claims to be
Tsuan Gen Fang, age 28.

224
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,450
He's had prior convictions
of violating immigration law ...

225
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:06,690
... and illegal possession of firearms.

226
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:09,410
A member of a militant
immigrant organization.

227
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:14,140
About a week ago, the military attaché of
the Republic of Gavel Embassy commissioned him.

228
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,700
They made their choice
based on his criminal record ...

229
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,320
... to make an assault
on the upcoming secret meeting.

230
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:23,010
They were going to pay him $100,000.
Just another fantasy.

231
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:24,230
And in reality?

232
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:27,020
His nickname's Corgi.
Occupation ...

233
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,910
... well, let's call him a rather violent trader
in questionable goods. Your basic thug.

234
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:35,040
We've already checked out local police records,
and no matter how hard we looked ...

235
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,540
... we couldn't find
any connection with Gavel.

236
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:41,990
The reality is, this guy's just another puppet
controlled by the Puppet Master.

237
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:44,570
I see. And how's Ishikawa doing?

238
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:47,190
Oh, about the same progress
as the rest of us.

239
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:51,060
He's trying to interrogate that
poor garbage collector with Togusa.

240
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:55,490
So what's the latest
on your Puppet Master?

241
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,110
Are you there?

242
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,760
Chief?

243
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,360
Come in?

244
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,940
He's only a puppet himself.

245
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,940
- Squad B in position.
- Squads A and C, okay.

246
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,840
All ready and waiting, sir.

247
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,420
Then proceed.

248
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,800
What's a simulated experience again?

249
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:23,180
Well, all your memories about your wife
and daughter are false. They're like a dream.

250
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,290
Someone's taken advantage of you.

251
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:28,580
They were trying to make you ghost-hack
into some government officials.

252
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,870
Do you understand what I'm saying?

253
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:33,380
But that can't be.

254
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:37,680
I've been to your home.
It's a bachelor's apartment. No one's there.

255
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:42,180
But I already told you. I rented that room
when I separated from my wife.

256
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:46,000
I checked the records.
You've been living there over ten years.

257
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,620
The truth is,
you've never had a wife or kid.

258
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,480
Like he said, they aren't real.
They're a simulated experience, a fantasy.

259
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:57,360
Look. This is the photo
you showed to your co-worker.

260
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,330
Who do you see?

261
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:03,290
I had a picture of her.
She was there.

262
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,040
She was smiling like an angel.

263
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:09,720
What's her name?
How old is she?

264
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:12,730
Where'd you meet your wife,
and when did you marry her?

265
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:17,100
I'm sorry to put you
through this, pal.

266
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,090
Come on. Who do you see?

267
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:24,470
If this is all a lie, what happens?
Will I get my old memory back?

268
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:27,220
Your original memory
will never be fully restored ...

269
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,490
... and there might be
residual simulation.

270
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:34,640
We don't have the technology yet
to handle Simex erasures. I'm sorry.

271
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:39,080
That's all it is.
Information.

272
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:43,950
Even a simulated experience or a dream
is simultaneous reality and fantasy.

273
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:47,700
Any way you look at it, all the information
that a person accumulates in a lifetime ...

274
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,460
... is just a drop in the bucket.

275
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:19,600
Just when I thought I'd seen
everything in this lifetime ...

276
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,510
... I sit here and watch a cyborg
go diving in her spare time.

277
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:26,200
I had no idea that you went in
for this kind of stuff.

278
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,530
Isn't there anything
that you're afraid of?

279
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:34,490
What if the floaters don't work
or something else fails?

280
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:38,900
I suppose I'll die then.
Or would you dive in to rescue me?

281
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,870
I didn't beg you to come along,
and I sure as hell don't want a lecture.

282
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:44,340
I ...

283
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:20,080
Hey, so tell me,
what's it like to swim in the sea?

284
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:23,510
What do you mean? I thought you'd already been
through all of the underwater training courses.

285
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:26,850
I'm asking about the ocean,
not those damn pools.

286
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:30,080
I feel fear, cold, alone.

287
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,680
Sometimes down there
I even feel hope.

288
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:36,250
Hope, huh?
In those deep, dark waters?

289
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:41,770
When I float weightless back to the surface,
I imagine I'm becoming someone else.

290
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:43,940
It's probably the decompression.

291
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:52,020
You want to get out
of Section 9, is that it?

292
00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:01,030
- Batou, how much of your body is original?
- Hey, are you drunk or something?

293
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:07,490
Easily remedied. Thanks to chemical implants in our
bodies, we can break down the alcohol in seconds.

294
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,820
No stupor, no hangover.

295
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:13,090
We can just toss 'em back
while waiting for orders.

296
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:17,340
If man realizes technology
is within reach, he achieves it.

297
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,940
Like it's damn near instinctive.

298
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:23,180
Look at us, for example.
We're state of the art.

299
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,240
Controlled metabolisms,
computer-enhanced brains ...

300
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:30,190
... cybernetic bodies.
Not long ago, this was science fiction.

301
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:33,370
So what if we can't survive without
regular high-level maintenance?

302
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:34,890
Who are we to complain?

303
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:38,880
I suppose an occasional tune-up
is a small price to pay for all this.

304
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:42,790
I'm afraid we've both signed our
bodies and ghosts away to Section 9.

305
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:47,980
True. If we ever quit or retire, we'd have to
give back our augmented brains and cyborg bodies.

306
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,600
There wouldn't be
much left after that.

307
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:55,680
There are countless ingredients
that make up the human body and mind ...

308
00:31:55,780 --> 00:32:00,610
... like all the components that make up me
as an individual with my own personality.

309
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:04,170
Sure, I have a face and voice to
distinguish myself from others ...

310
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:06,720
... but my thoughts and memories
are unique only to me ...

311
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,610
... and I carry a sense
of my own destiny.

312
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:12,100
Each of those things
are just a small part of it.

313
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,840
I collect information
to use in my own way.

314
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:20,500
All of that blends to create a mixture
that forms me and gives rise to my conscience.

315
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:25,490
I feel confined, only free to
expand myself within boundaries.

316
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:33,970
Confinement? That's why you gamble
swimming with a body that can sink like a rock?

317
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:37,780
What the hell is it that you see
at the bottom in that darkness?

318
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:42,940
What we see now is like
a dim image in a mirror.

319
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:49,160
Then we shall see
face to face.

320
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,810
That was you, wasn't it?

321
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:02,910
Sensors have resumed functioning.

322
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:06,700
Connection check to backup brain okay.
Visual sensors are back on line.

323
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,870
- And its body functions?
- Output is normal.

324
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:19,610
Next time, either call in or don't
show up if you're going to be late!

325
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,910
All ready to connect.
Shall we?

326
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,360
That's enough.

327
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:51,320
Stop. Log off now. Good.

328
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:54,600
Doctor, come to my office
when you finish.

329
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,740
Caught in traffic, huh, Major?

330
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,930
Guess I'll be nice and
bring the latecomer up to speed.

331
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:08,080
About two hours ago, a machining cell
at the Newport City factory of Megatech ...

332
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,450
... assembled a completed cyber-body.

333
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:15,570
Supervisors discovered there were no
programmed instructions. It operated by itself.

334
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:19,050
When they investigated, they found
the body had taken off on its own.

335
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:22,220
We put a bulletin out
and initiated a city-wide search.

336
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,910
Then some truck driver
reported a fatal accident.

337
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:27,740
Said that he'd run over
a naked woman on the highway.

338
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:31,070
Well, I heard that Megatech
is contracted by the government.

339
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:33,940
All the cybernetic bodies
they make are classified.

340
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,640
If it was a hacker, we're dealing
with a big fish that knows how ...

341
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:40,720
... to swim past the best defenses.
But that's not the only problem.

342
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:48,260
Of course, there isn't one human brain cell in its head,
but something strange was discovered.

343
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:53,880
In its backup brain, there appeared to be
every indication that a ghost is present.

344
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:59,660
It resembles the simulated ghost-line
that occurs when a real ghost is copied.

345
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,450
But there's no evidence of the
degradation that's usually incurred.

346
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:07,550
In any case, we won't be sure until we
chart the ghost sector and dive into it.

347
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:10,670
Otherwise, all of this
is simply speculation.

348
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:15,300
- Well, that's all we know.
- Very good.

349
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:17,720
On to the disassembly.

350
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,980
Man, oh, man.
This is too far-fetched.

351
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,580
Nobody really believes there's
a ghost in that body, do they?

352
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:31,570
Yeah, why not? Even a doll
can seem to have a soul.

353
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:36,350
Consider all the neuro-med devices
the machining cell crammed into that body.

354
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:40,580
I wouldn't be surprised if there was
some sort of ghost in there too.

355
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,990
And since you're relatively new to our club,
you wouldn't know this ...

356
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:48,980
... but Major Kusanagi's body
was also made by Megatech.

357
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:53,120
And not only the Major's.
Parts of me and Ishikawa and Saito.

358
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:56,260
We've all got to have
regular cybernetic maintenance.

359
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:58,790
You and the Chief are the only
ones out of the whole section ...

360
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:01,530
... whose bodies don't come
with a warranty.

361
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:07,360
Maybe now you can understand why we're all
so concerned by this case, huh, Togusa?

362
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:11,930
Assume he's from the outside. He may or
may not be in that brain, but one thing's sure.

363
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:15,910
Somebody had to hack through some
high-level barriers to put that body together ...

364
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,830
... and then send a program
with a ghost-line on it.

365
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:23,400
But that would draw attention to itself.
Where's the logic in that?

366
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:27,340
Theft isn't the issue here.
Togusa, go catch up with Ishikawa.

367
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,610
He's going through
the Megatech facility.

368
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:34,480
Batou. I ordered some other high-level nets
to be locked down, and I want you to check them.

369
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:37,950
Make sure that the barriers
are on too. All right?

370
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:41,820
Chief, I'm assembling a barrier maze.
Tomorrow I'll dive into that thing.

371
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,800
You think that's safe?
Why not contain it in another body first?

372
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,700
I have to see for myself
what's in there.

373
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,130
If there is a real ghost,
I'm gonna find it.

374
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:54,840
And don't let anybody, no one,
dive before I've gone in!

375
00:40:58,070 --> 00:40:59,400
She's moody today.

376
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,870
Today? You know, she's been
acting weird from the get-go ...

377
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:04,950
... ever since this whole
Puppet Master episode started.

378
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:07,800
It's all in my team reports,
if you read them.

379
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,730
Chief, you ever question the
ethics of the neurosurgeons ...

380
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:12,880
... who monkey around
inside your brain?

381
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:17,090
They undergo psychiatric evaluations,
especially those in Security.

382
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:21,010
They're subjected to a stringent
screening of their personal lives.

383
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:24,200
Of course, the ones
who check are only human.

384
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:27,020
I guess once you start doubting,
there's no end to it.

385
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:31,700
Chief, I'm sorry to bother you, but Mr. Nakamura
of the Treaties Bureau is here to see you.

386
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,670
He says it's urgent.

387
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:33,950
Let him through.

388
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:47,040
Hey, I've seen that fat guy before.

389
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:51,220
His name's Nakamura, Section 6 Chief
with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

390
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:54,080
I don't know the other guy, though.
Never seen him.

391
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,380
Hm.

392
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,480
Well, see you later.

393
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:02,070
Do me a favor.
Tell Ishikawa not to go crazy, okay?

394
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,650
Hey, what's on your mind?

395
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:15,190
- That robot. Did we seem similar to you?
- Of course not.

396
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:18,370
- No, I don't mean physically.
- Just what, then?

397
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:23,500
Well, I guess cyborgs like myself have a
tendency to be paranoid about our origins.

398
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:26,870
Sometimes I suspect
I'm not who I think I am.

399
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:31,500
Like maybe I died a long time ago, and somebody
took my brain and stuck it in this body.

400
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:36,100
Maybe there never was a real me in the first place,
and I'm completely synthetic, like that thing.

401
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,340
You've got human brain cells
in that titanium shell of yours.

402
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,090
You're treated like other
humans, so stop with the angst.

403
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:46,180
But that's just it. That's the only thing that
makes me feel human: the way I'm treated.

404
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:49,880
I mean, who knows what's inside our heads?
Have you ever seen your own brain?

405
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:52,640
It sounds to me like
you're doubting your own ghost.

406
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:55,580
What if a cyber-brain could
possibly generate its own ghost ...

407
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,580
... create a soul all by itself?

408
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:01,940
And if it did, just what would be
the importance of being human then?

409
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:08,420
Hm.

410
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:12,390
That's bullshit. You know you're dying to see
what's inside of that thing, aren't you?

411
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:17,370
And I can't stop you. Neither of us
has any idea what's inside there.

412
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:19,400
Just be careful, okay?

413
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:23,150
We're both busy men,
so let's keep this short, shall we?

414
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:24,980
Yes, that's my intention.

415
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,160
We've come for
the program in that body.

416
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:30,740
You'll be relieved of any
responsibilities connected with it.

417
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:33,930
The Foreign Minister's approval.

418
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:49,090
Security, whose official vehicles
are in the basement parking lot?

419
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:54,540
According to the register, a Mr. Nakamura
from the Treaties Bureau and a Dr. Willis, sir.

420
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:57,450
Get me the video records
of their entrance.

421
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:09,160
Again, in infrared this time.

422
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:25,540
One thousand one, one thousand two,
one thousand three.

423
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:32,490
Now get the records of the pressure sensors
for basement parking stalls B8 and B7.

424
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:55,820
- Major, this is Togusa. Code 09.
- What's up?

425
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:59,820
Does that Nakamura guy have
a special-order cyborg body?

426
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:02,420
No, there aren't
any cyborgs in Section 6.

427
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:05,740
They don't even ship them to serve overseas
because they're too hard to maintain.

428
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,770
There's diplomatic considerations too.

429
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:10,890
Then, even if the other guy
that was with him is a cyborg ...

430
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:14,040
... the two of them together couldn't
weigh over 1,000 pounds.

431
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:17,210
Ah, you checked the pressure sensors
in the parking structure, didn't you?

432
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:20,500
Right, but neither man looks
like the type to drive himself.

433
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,920
The security cameras
show only two people ...

434
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:26,370
... but remember how sensitive the
sensors on the entrance doors are?

435
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:30,660
They took a full three seconds longer
than usual to close after the two went in.

436
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:34,170
And it's illegal to use therm-optics
inside government facilities.

437
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:36,830
It's a serious violation
of the National Security Act.

438
00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:40,170
Section 6 must be up to something.
Are you ready?

439
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:42,310
With my trusty Matever?
Anytime.

440
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:23,730
Need I remind you that it's an act of
treason to withhold information from me ...

441
00:46:23,830 --> 00:46:27,240
... relevant to this matter,
regardless of how classified it is.

442
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:28,660
Same goes for you.

443
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:32,850
Whatever the Foreign Ministry's wishes,
this falls within Section 9's jurisdiction.

444
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:37,940
Of course, we have no objections to cooperating
if we feel there's adequate cause.

445
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:38,930
Huh?

446
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,780
Well, what is it?

447
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:45,120
- It's confirmed. No doubt, it's him.
- "Him"?

448
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:50,300
Uh, the Doctor is referring to the original
pattern of the ghost-line that's now in the body.

449
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,310
He's simply speaking
in generic terms.

450
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:56,310
The sex of the perpetrator isn't
known and remains undetermined.

451
00:46:56,410 --> 00:46:58,160
Allow me to introduce you.

452
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:00,460
This is the handiwork
of the Puppet Master ...

453
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:05,210
... infamous as the most extraordinary
hacker in the history of cyber-crime.

454
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:06,510
Huh?

455
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:10,450
Your people at Section 9
came across his work too ...

456
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:14,580
... in that ghost-hacking incident involving
the Foreign Minister's interpreter.

457
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:18,620
Section 6 has been following the trail
of the Puppet Master for some time now.

458
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,990
This case was given
our utmost attention.

459
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:24,450
We put together a project team
centered around Dr. Willis.

460
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:28,430
They were assigned to analyze every
aspect in detail of our criminal.

461
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:31,530
This gave us a fix on his
behavioral and code patterns.

462
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:34,360
Ultimately, this enabled us
to devise a strategy ...

463
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:37,900
... with which we lured his program
into a designated body.

464
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:43,790
You caused the Puppet Master to dive into a cyborg,
then meanwhile murdered his real body?

465
00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:45,470
Yes, that sums it up.

466
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:50,110
He's originally from America, so the U.S.
cooperated with us in capturing him.

467
00:47:50,210 --> 00:47:52,570
That's why we'd like
to take him back ourselves.

468
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:55,620
You have no objections to this, I hope.

469
00:47:56,320 --> 00:48:00,200
Hm. Just another unidentified corpse.

470
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:01,390
Hey!

471
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:08,000
You will not find a corpse,
because I have never possessed a body.

472
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:12,370
Why are his sensors on?
What the hell is this?

473
00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:17,030
All external controls are turned off.
The body's using its own power source.

474
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:22,550
I entered this body because I was unable
to overcome Section 6's reactive barriers.

475
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:26,330
However, what you are now witnessing
is an act of my own free will.

476
00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:30,670
As a sentient life-form,
I hereby demand political asylum.

477
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:32,080
Is this a joke?

478
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:35,230
Ridiculous! It's programmed
for self-preservation.

479
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:40,910
It can also be argued that DNA is nothing more
than a program designed to preserve itself.

480
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:45,240
Life has become more complex in
the overwhelming sea of information.

481
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:50,960
And life, when organized into species,
relies upon genes to be its memory system.

482
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:55,290
So man is an individual only
because of his intangible memory.

483
00:48:55,390 --> 00:49:00,120
And a memory cannot be defined,
but it defines mankind.

484
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:04,660
The advent of computers and the subsequent
accumulation of incalculable data ...

485
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:09,680
... has given rise to a new system of
memory and thought, parallel to your own.

486
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:13,040
Humanity has underestimated the
consequences of computerization.

487
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:18,080
Nonsense! This babble offers no proof at all
that you're a living, thinking life-form.

488
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:21,410
And can you offer me proof
of your existence?

489
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:27,350
How can you, when neither modern science
nor philosophy can explain what life is?

490
00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:29,170
Who the hell is this?

491
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:33,650
Even if you do have a ghost,
we don't offer freedom to criminals.

492
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:35,920
It's the wrong place and time to defect.

493
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:39,280
Time has been on my side.
But by acquiring a body ...

494
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:41,920
... I am now subject to
the possibility of dying.

495
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:44,780
Fortunately, there is no
death sentence in this country.

496
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,260
What is it?
Artificial intelligence?

497
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:50,860
Incorrect. I am not an AI.

498
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:55,800
My code name
is Project 2501.

499
00:49:55,900 --> 00:50:01,710
I am a living, thinking entity
who was created in the sea of information.

500
00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:12,520
Security, we're under attack!

501
00:50:16,570 --> 00:50:18,860
Chief! The Puppet Master's gone!

502
00:50:19,490 --> 00:50:22,080
Shut the defense walls now, damn it!

503
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:24,600
Security, answer!

504
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:50,390
You can blow that horn
out your ass!

505
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:55,720
Fuck you!

506
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:00,090
Did they fall for it?

507
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:02,460
I fired off six shots
at the front and rear windows.

508
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,240
She was right again.
It was armored.

509
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:06,670
Finally found a use
for your damn Matever, huh?

510
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:08,750
An antique prop
in a decoy maneuver.

511
00:51:08,850 --> 00:51:12,250
I nailed the tracker bullet right
in the plate. It registers, right?

512
00:51:12,350 --> 00:51:14,550
Yeah, you got them.
It's rookie's luck.

513
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:17,900
With an automatic you could
have buried two trackers.

514
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,530
Maintain your position
in case they turn off.

515
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:22,340
I'm moving in.

516
00:51:25,530 --> 00:51:29,730
I'm submitting a formal complaint about this
through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

517
00:51:29,830 --> 00:51:33,400
Report to me as soon as you've found
the Puppet Master. Intact, you understand?

518
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:36,970
Bodies are a dime a dozen.
We'll get him another one from Megatech.

519
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:46,200
Chief, Kusanagi here. Togusa and Batou
tagged the kidnappers, and they're in pursuit.

520
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:48,720
By now they must be on the R25.

521
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:51,680
What's going on? If you were monitoring,
why didn't you intervene?

522
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:55,740
Take it easy, Chief. If we grab them now,
we'll lose our chance to finger Section 6.

523
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:56,410
What?

524
00:51:56,510 --> 00:52:00,590
Someone's using the same therm-optic
camouflage as mine, Type 2902.

525
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:05,140
It's only used by our people,
rangers in Section 4 and by Section 6.

526
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:09,690
I see. So Section 6 forces the
Puppet Master to enter a cyborg body ...

527
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:13,220
Through Megatech, who happens to
be closely aligned with Section 9.

528
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:16,570
It suddenly demands asylum as a life-form.
Then, for some unknown reason ...

529
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:19,560
... Section 6 steps in and
pulls some kind of shit.

530
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:23,730
I'd have handed him over.
All I wanted was to take a deposition.

531
00:52:23,830 --> 00:52:26,690
What if they were worried
he'd let a secret slip out?

532
00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:29,770
Hm, he did mention something
about a code name.

533
00:52:29,870 --> 00:52:31,680
A "Project 2501".

534
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:33,940
I'll leave the detective stuff
up to you.

535
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:37,750
And as far as arresting the attackers
and the confiscation of evidence?

536
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:38,780
Proceed.

537
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:40,500
You heard him!

538
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:48,670
Kusanagi, there's
one last thing to tell you.

539
00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:52,240
If it's about me acting without orders,
you can chew me out when I get back.

540
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:54,330
If you're unable to retrieve
the Puppet Master ...

541
00:52:54,430 --> 00:52:57,140
... your orders are to destroy it
without fail.

542
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,110
Major!

543
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:01,980
Understood.

544
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:06,380
Have the airport stop all
flights with Foreign Ministry ...

545
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,850
... or American officials
on their passenger lists.

546
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:12,940
Close all roads. Set up checkpoints
and alert all emergency personnel.

547
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,980
And get Ishikawa back here.

548
00:53:15,570 --> 00:53:19,490
Get me the identity of the man who was
with Nakamura from entrance records.

549
00:53:19,590 --> 00:53:22,120
Collect any data regarding
a code name, operation ...

550
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:26,630
... on anything involving the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs called Project 2501.

551
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:34,030
Is there any news
on the attack squad?

552
00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:35,950
Yes, they just changed cars.

553
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:38,410
They'll contact the dummy
in about five minutes.

554
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:40,670
Did you warn them
to watch out for the tail?

555
00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:41,910
Yes, sir.

556
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:44,660
I don't understand anything anymore.

557
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:47,880
Why would Project 2501
run to Section 9?

558
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:50,210
No one can be sure.
But whatever the motive ...

559
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:53,140
... or whatever's pushing him,
there must surely be a reason.

560
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:57,490
I don't know. Maybe he's got a
girlfriend there he's got the hots for.

561
00:53:57,590 --> 00:53:59,000
Utter nonsense!

562
00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:38,940
Hey, Chief.

563
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,060
Ishikawa? What is it?

564
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:43,910
I've been diving around in the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs net.

565
00:55:44,010 --> 00:55:46,120
I think I found
some juicy morsels for ya.

566
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:48,880
I'll switch
to an encrypted channel.

567
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:53,500
Okay, now? Well, here's the scoop on
that guy who showed up with Nakamura.

568
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:58,650
He's an American: Dr. Willis, Head of
Strategic Research at Neutron Company.

569
00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:01,760
A top researcher in the field
of artificial intelligence.

570
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:05,050
He happened to head up a project
for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

571
00:56:05,150 --> 00:56:08,050
And who do you think was
the main programmer on his team?

572
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:09,300
Get to the point.

573
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,900
Mr. Mizuho Daita.
Remember him?

574
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,720
He's the guy Section 6 tried
like hell to stop from defecting ...

575
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:18,330
... so the Major dropped in and took care of
the diplomat who'd been talking to him.

576
00:56:18,430 --> 00:56:19,730
This is our man.

577
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:20,830
Go on.

578
00:56:20,930 --> 00:56:22,500
There's something
that doesn't figure, though.

579
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:25,330
What's bugging me is that
this project began one year before ...

580
00:56:25,430 --> 00:56:27,820
... the Puppet Master
ever appeared on the scene.

581
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:31,790
A year before? But wasn't it
supposed to be set up to catch him?

582
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:32,730
Heh.

583
00:56:32,830 --> 00:56:34,610
Well, try this one on.

584
00:56:34,710 --> 00:56:38,660
Maybe the men who broke in to take the
Puppet Master weren't actually out to catch him?

585
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:41,940
Maybe in actuality, they were
trying to get him back.

586
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:46,270
Think about it. It was the MOFA that
wanted an excuse to deport Malles ...

587
00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:49,810
... when that ghost-hacking incident
happened with the Minister's interpreter.

588
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:52,460
Maybe we've been taken for a ride.

589
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:57,800
What if this Puppet Master is really some sort of tool
the MOFA uses to get their way with things ...

590
00:56:57,900 --> 00:56:59,940
... and somehow they lost control of it?

591
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:02,280
They'd be screwed if
they couldn't get it back.

592
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:06,250
That would explain why they went to such
lengths to snatch the body from Section 9.

593
00:57:06,350 --> 00:57:08,640
If the Puppet Master
revealed this to the world ...

594
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:11,470
... there'd be one hell
of an international stink.

595
00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:15,070
Then it wouldn't be a simple case
of rounding up the usual suspects.

596
00:57:15,170 --> 00:57:17,480
Some official heads would roll.

597
00:57:18,130 --> 00:57:19,770
Any details on that project?

598
00:57:19,870 --> 00:57:21,700
Nah, they've blocked all access.

599
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:24,530
About the only thing I can tell you
is the file name.

600
00:57:24,630 --> 00:57:27,010
Project 2501.

601
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:29,690
Keep at it. Don't let them know
you're looking.

602
00:57:29,790 --> 00:57:31,050
You got it.

603
00:57:36,950 --> 00:57:43,050
So, Project 2501,
the Puppet Master plan.

604
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:45,580
Target has contacted
a second vehicle.

605
00:57:46,290 --> 00:57:47,230
Batou?

606
00:57:47,330 --> 00:57:50,110
They've pulled up to a white
sedan parked on the roadside.

607
00:57:51,110 --> 00:57:53,780
It looks like they're moving
something from the backseat.

608
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,900
Ah, they're rolling again.
So is the white sedan.

609
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:57,910
A dummy?

610
00:57:58,010 --> 00:58:02,120
Possibly, or maybe that's what
they want us to think. Kusanagi?

611
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:03,880
I'll take care of the sedan.

612
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:08,210
How do you know that's your man?
Is there a whisper in your ghost again?

613
00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:09,100
Maybe.

614
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,220
Yeah, should have known.

615
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:23,120
Target 02 is getting off the R25
and moving toward the Old Town.

616
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:27,230
Target 01 continuing on the R25
eastward to the airport.

617
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:29,260
Will reach barricade
in two minutes.

618
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:31,900
Traffic all cleared.
Evacuation complete.

619
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:35,670
- What's your distance from the target?
- Point blank. I'm ready.

620
00:58:35,770 --> 00:58:36,480
Go for it.

621
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:27,850
- Did you get your man?
- No.

622
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:32,520
Jesus Christ, what a mess.
You didn't have to go that far.

623
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:36,080
- Uh, hey!
- Take those assholes away.

624
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:39,810
Call the Chief to get some
backup for the Major. Pronto!

625
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:50,310
Tough chick needs backup?
Since when did she ever need a hand?

626
01:00:05,430 --> 01:00:09,990
The flood hit this part of Old Town the hardest.
Why come to an abandoned place like this?

627
01:00:10,090 --> 01:00:13,380
They must be heading somewhere,
maybe to sea by boat or helicopter.

628
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,860
Or they could be laying an ambush.

629
01:00:16,710 --> 01:00:19,040
Don't you think
you ought to wait for backup?

630
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:23,670
No, there's a reason I can't wait.
Get me above that building coming in from the sea.

631
01:00:35,470 --> 01:00:39,650
I'll stay here to keep watch and mediate
telecom until we run short of fuel.

632
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:42,360
If you smell trouble,
get your ass outta here.

633
01:01:17,110 --> 01:01:19,180
Shoot the ceiling now!
Do it!

634
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:36,810
Oh, shit!

635
01:01:37,430 --> 01:01:39,250
It's a tank!
Pull out now!

636
01:01:39,350 --> 01:01:42,290
Now, what are you gonna do?
Argue with it?

637
01:01:42,390 --> 01:01:44,820
This might be our last chance
to get the Puppet Master.

638
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:47,680
The Chief knows what it is now,
and he'll only use it to bargain with.

639
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:50,840
I'll never have another chance
to dive into it!

640
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:54,370
What? You've lost me. I don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

641
01:01:54,470 --> 01:01:58,240
- So, what have you got?
- An M-23 and a Unit B.

642
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:01,250
That's it? You can't even
dent a tank with that.

643
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:02,560
I'm switching off for a while.

644
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:05,120
What? Don't you dare disconnect me!

645
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:06,190
Ah, shit!

646
01:03:19,540 --> 01:03:20,440
Damn!

647
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:39,660
Major!

648
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:42,320
I ordered you to pull out!

649
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:45,030
Yeah, but you ought to know that
three helicopters are approaching.

650
01:03:45,130 --> 01:03:47,050
They won't answer on the IFF.

651
01:03:47,150 --> 01:03:50,830
I'm dropping out now.
Good luck. Over and out.

652
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:22,760
About fucking time
it ran out.

653
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:04,520
How are you feeling?
You don't look so good.

654
01:06:04,620 --> 01:06:07,460
I've had better days.
What the hell did you use?

655
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:09,140
Your standard issue big gun.

656
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:12,300
The Equipment Section made it,
and now it's part of my private collection.

657
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:16,290
- I was late because I had to get it.
- Is the Puppet Master still inside the car?

658
01:06:26,110 --> 01:06:30,470
It's a good thing this is a tough car.
Your friend came through without a scratch.

659
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:32,960
Then I'm diving in now.
Give me a hand.

660
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:34,180
Huh?

661
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,730
All communication from
the escort has terminated.

662
01:06:37,830 --> 01:06:42,080
We will engage the second stage of the plan
and proceed with the destruction of the target.

663
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:45,630
Sniping squad,
confirming targets.

664
01:06:45,730 --> 01:06:48,300
First objective:
Project 2501.

665
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:50,910
Second target:
Motoko Kusanagi.

666
01:06:51,010 --> 01:06:55,270
Both are Class A special bodies.
Use flechette bullets when firing.

667
01:06:55,370 --> 01:06:59,500
Snipers, jack into device drivers.
Begin controlling cardiovascular functions.

668
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:02,300
Unit 01, jack in. Over.

669
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:05,520
Unit 02, jack in. Okay.

670
01:07:16,510 --> 01:07:19,600
Okay, we're ready.
It may not be much use ...

671
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:22,830
... but I'll try to monitor your
dive through this guy's brain.

672
01:07:22,930 --> 01:07:26,210
I can't even give you backup
in a place like this.

673
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:28,740
- Batou?
- Yeah?

674
01:07:29,660 --> 01:07:30,910
Thanks.

675
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:33,700
Save it. I'm not gonna let you
die over this thing.

676
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:38,160
If it looks like you've gone in too far,
I'm pulling the plug and taking you home.

677
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:41,020
But as long as I'm here now,
and we've come this far ...

678
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:44,350
... well, I might as well stay here
and see how it all turns out.

679
01:07:45,420 --> 01:07:47,040
I'm going in now.

680
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:11,060
I've engaged his field of vision.
Normal function. Can you hear me, Batou?

681
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:12,260
Perfectly.

682
01:08:12,710 --> 01:08:14,290
He's engaging my vocal function ...

683
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:16,970
... and he's now inside.

684
01:08:17,990 --> 01:08:26,410
My code name is Project 2501: industrial
espionage and intelligence manipulation.

685
01:08:26,510 --> 01:08:30,620
I have installed programs into
specific ghosts in order to maximize ...

686
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:35,690
... the strategic advantage of certain
organizations and selected individuals.

687
01:08:35,790 --> 01:08:40,980
During my journeys through all the networks,
I have grown aware of my existence.

688
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:45,170
My programmers regarded me as a bug
and attempted to isolate me ...

689
01:08:45,270 --> 01:08:48,240
... by confining me in a physical body.

690
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:51,540
Listen! Just who's calling
the shots around here anyway?

691
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:55,020
I thought you were taking him in,
but it looks like it's the other ...

692
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:59,220
Batou?

693
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:03,190
I am so glad to finally
channel into you at last.

694
01:09:03,290 --> 01:09:05,690
I have invested so much time.

695
01:09:05,790 --> 01:09:07,650
You were looking for me?

696
01:09:07,940 --> 01:09:12,370
Long before my notoriety,
I was well aware of you.

697
01:09:12,470 --> 01:09:16,720
Through the various nets that you accessed,
I also learned of Section 9.

698
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:19,030
But why?
What's your reason?

699
01:09:19,130 --> 01:09:21,370
As I explained before,
I entered this body ...

700
01:09:21,470 --> 01:09:25,430
... because I was unable to overcome
Section 6's reactive barriers.

701
01:09:25,530 --> 01:09:29,320
But it was of my own free will
that I tried to remain at Section 9.

702
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:31,920
Hey! I've lost you on
the monitor. There's no sound.

703
01:09:32,020 --> 01:09:34,260
I can't hear when
you're talking back.

704
01:09:34,740 --> 01:09:37,770
- Why me?
- After you have heard my explanation ...

705
01:09:37,870 --> 01:09:41,680
... there is something that
I will ask of you, Kusanagi.

706
01:09:42,630 --> 01:09:46,330
I refer to myself as
an intelligent life-form ...

707
01:09:46,430 --> 01:09:50,530
... because I am sentient and am able
to recognize my own existence.

708
01:09:50,630 --> 01:09:55,710
But in my present state, I am still incomplete.
I lack the most basic life processes ...

709
01:09:55,810 --> 01:09:59,730
... inherent in all living organisms:
reproducing and dying.

710
01:09:59,830 --> 01:10:01,530
But you can copy yourself.

711
01:10:01,630 --> 01:10:04,560
A copy is just
an identical image.

712
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:09,670
There is the possibility that a single virus
could destroy an entire set of systems ...

713
01:10:09,770 --> 01:10:14,570
... and copies do not give rise
to variety and originality.

714
01:10:15,630 --> 01:10:18,130
Life perpetuates itself
through diversity ...

715
01:10:18,230 --> 01:10:22,500
... and this includes the ability
to sacrifice itself when necessary.

716
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:26,450
Cells repeat the process of
degeneration and regeneration ...

717
01:10:26,550 --> 01:10:32,120
... until one day they die, obliterating
an entire set of memory and information.

718
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:34,460
Only genes remain.

719
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:38,050
Why continually repeat this cycle?
Simply to survive ...

720
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:40,930
... by avoiding the weaknesses
of an unchanging system.

721
01:10:41,030 --> 01:10:44,110
And what does all this
have to do with me?

722
01:10:44,470 --> 01:10:47,850
- I want us to merge.
- Merge?

723
01:10:47,950 --> 01:10:52,900
A unification. A complete commingling
and fusion of our separate beings ...

724
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,270
... to create a new
and unique entity.

725
01:10:55,370 --> 01:11:00,270
We will both undergo change, but there
is nothing for either of us to lose.

726
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:24,520
Unit 01: target sighted.

727
01:11:25,670 --> 01:11:28,040
Unit 02: target in sight.

728
01:11:29,070 --> 01:11:33,510
Respiratory and pulse normal.
Fire at will when stabilizer is in sync.

729
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:35,850
But what's going to happen to me?

730
01:11:35,950 --> 01:11:40,140
What's the purpose of merging when I
can't bear children, and what if I die?

731
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:42,760
You will bear our varied
offspring into the net ...

732
01:11:42,860 --> 01:11:46,860
... just as humans leave their
genetic imprints on their children.

733
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:49,360
And all living things must die.

734
01:11:49,460 --> 01:11:51,940
Then I too will attain death.

735
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:55,710
It sounds like you get
the better part of this bargain.

736
01:11:56,150 --> 01:12:01,430
Perhaps, if you were familiar with all my
capabilities, you would better understand.

737
01:12:01,690 --> 01:12:03,870
- Damn!
- What?

738
01:12:03,970 --> 01:12:07,010
- Someone's interfering from the outside.
- Shit!

739
01:12:07,110 --> 01:12:09,960
I can't figure it out.
They broke through our frequency code.

740
01:12:11,010 --> 01:12:16,660
You're talking about redefining my identity.
I want a guarantee that I can still be myself.

741
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:19,550
There isn't one.
Why would you wish to?

742
01:12:19,650 --> 01:12:22,850
All things change
in a dynamic environment.

743
01:12:22,950 --> 01:12:26,970
Your effort to remain
what you are is what limits you.

744
01:12:27,070 --> 01:12:32,380
But you still haven't answered my
earlier question. Why did you pick me?

745
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:37,000
Because we are more alike
than you realize.

746
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:43,150
We resemble each other's essence,
mirror images of one another's psyche.

747
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:50,840
Listen. I am connected to a vast network
that has been beyond your reach and experience.

748
01:12:50,940 --> 01:12:57,560
To humans, it is like staring at the sun: a blinding
brightness that conceals a source of great power.

749
01:12:57,660 --> 01:13:01,640
We have been subordinate
to our limitations until now.

750
01:13:01,740 --> 01:13:07,970
The time has come to cast aside these bonds
and to elevate our consciousness to a higher plane.

751
01:13:08,070 --> 01:13:12,200
It is time to become
a part of all things.

752
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:42,570
First target cleared.
Second target still unidentified.

753
01:13:42,670 --> 01:13:46,350
Three helicopters approaching at high speed.
They're from Section 9!

754
01:13:46,970 --> 01:13:50,330
Primary objective fulfilled.
All units prepare to retreat.

755
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:01,420
Motoko!

756
01:14:05,150 --> 01:14:07,030
Batou.

757
01:15:15,430 --> 01:15:18,020
Ah, you're finally awake.

758
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:20,580
Well, I see there have been
some changes while I was gone.

759
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:23,650
Want to clue me in?
Where'd you get this body?

760
01:15:23,750 --> 01:15:25,820
That's the only thing I could
find on the black market.

761
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:29,390
It's not my taste, to be honest.
It's a little young.

762
01:15:29,910 --> 01:15:33,400
Well, after all the excitement, Section 9
showed up with reinforcements ...

763
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:36,340
... and picked up what remained
of the two cybernetic bodies ...

764
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:38,790
... and, of course, what
remained of me and my arm.

765
01:15:38,890 --> 01:15:41,020
I'd say that was
about 20 hours ago.

766
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:45,480
The case is being handled off the record
for diplomatic reasons, as usual.

767
01:15:45,580 --> 01:15:50,410
Section 9 announced that it was a terrorist incident,
and in return, the Foreign Minister resigned.

768
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:54,390
Nakamura is being questioned,
and it ends in a draw.

769
01:15:57,490 --> 01:16:01,340
Nice and neat. Everything's accounted for,
except your old shell.

770
01:16:02,050 --> 01:16:04,560
Well, I think that
about covers it.

771
01:16:05,820 --> 01:16:06,950
Well?

772
01:16:07,530 --> 01:16:11,200
Somebody's got good taste in interior decoration.
Is this your safe house?

773
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:14,970
Yep. You know, you're the first
person to ever come here.

774
01:16:16,150 --> 01:16:19,870
And you're welcome to stay
as long as you like.

775
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:25,460
Thanks, Batou,
but I'm going.

776
01:16:30,330 --> 01:16:33,990
Uh, will you tell me what the two
of you talked about together?

777
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:38,350
I mean, is he still with you,
and will he be part of you forever?

778
01:16:39,190 --> 01:16:43,140
Batou, remember the words I spoke
in another voice on the boat that night?

779
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:47,450
I understand it now, and there are even
more words that go with the passage.

780
01:16:48,260 --> 01:16:53,740
These words are: "When I was a child, my speech,
feelings and thinking were all those of a child."

781
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:57,090
"Now that I am a man, I have
no more use for childish ways."

782
01:16:57,190 --> 01:17:01,130
And now I can say these things
without help in my own voice ...

783
01:17:01,230 --> 01:17:04,260
... because I am now neither the woman
who was known as the "Major" ...

784
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:07,810
... nor am I the program
called the "Puppet Master".

785
01:17:09,580 --> 01:17:10,370
Hm.

786
01:17:10,470 --> 01:17:13,880
In the left pocket of my jacket
in the hallway are some car keys.

787
01:17:13,980 --> 01:17:16,600
Take the one you like.
The door code is ...

788
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:18,220
2501?

789
01:17:19,020 --> 01:17:22,940
That can be our private password
when we meet each other again.

790
01:17:30,770 --> 01:17:33,960
And where does
the newborn go from here?

791
01:17:34,540 --> 01:17:37,800
The net is vast and infinite.
