# When it's coming apart,
you had it all #

3
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,875
# It wasn't enough #

4
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,429
# No, it's not enough #

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,197
# They tell you
it's not worth the price #

6
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,676
# So just let it go #

7
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,354
# But you know you can't #

8
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,953
# You know you won't #

9
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:55,680
# It's not easy, no,
finding the words to say #

10
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:03,918
# When you're feeling lost,
you'll find your way #

11
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:11,590
# The world is so broken and
sometimes it leaves you cold #

12
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,349
# At nighttimes you can't feel
the fire to guide you home #

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,836
# The demons will harm you and
try to steal what you know #

14
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,555
# But the angels,
they brought you #

15
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,958
# And they're
gonna hold you up #

16
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,397
# They're gonna hold you up #

17
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,433
# They see
the fear in your eyes #

18
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,677
# Heart sinks like a stone #

19
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:59,160
# 'Cause when you're afraid,
it weighs on your soul #

20
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:07,990
# When the timing is right,
somehow you'll know #

21
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:16,520
# When nobody stands,
stand on your own #

22
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:26,320
# It's not easy, no,
finding the words to say #

# When you're feeling lost,
you'll find your way #

33
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,908
- Name?
- Wheaton. Josh Wheaton.

34
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,553
You got your
pre-registration sheet?

35
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,398
Yeah.

36
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,639
All core requirements are here.

37
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,229
What is your
humanities elective?

38
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,839
Philosophy 150.

39
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,277
Radisson, 11:00 on Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday.

40
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,875
You might want to think about
a different instructor.

41
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,479
Because?

42
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,318
Let's just say you're
wandering into the snake pit.

43
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,399
I'd recommend Patel
or maybe Mueller.

44
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,313
Come on, man.
It can't be that bad.

45
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,839
Think Roman Colosseum, lions,
people cheering for your death.

46
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,837
Yeah, but I'd have to
rearrange my whole schedule.

47
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,473
I don't think I can really...

48
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,318
It's your funeral.

49
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,474
Last drop date is the 22nd.

50
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,592
You might want to
keep that in mind.

51
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,279
You're done.

52
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,471
- Thanks.
- Yeah, have a good semester.

53
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,111
- Hi.
- Martin Yip.

54
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,716
What does
P.R.C. stand for?

55
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,632
People's Republic of China.

56
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,711
Oh. Seriously?

57
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,309
Oh yes, always serious.

58
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,272
Okay.

59
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,198
You've gotta be kidding me!

60
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,910
White & Wolfe,
how can I help you?

61
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,519
Yes, please hold.

62
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,153
White & Wolfe.

63
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,918
Mm-hmm, I will let 'em know
you called.

64
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,519
Thank you, bye-bye.

65
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,159
Buy as much
Tochigi Heavy Industries

66
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,918
as you can on-margin.

67
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,519
We've gotten wind of a merger

68
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,548
and the Japanese could care less
about insider trading.

69
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:39,470
You're gonna thank me
for this one, I guarantee it.

70
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,919
You're on with Marc.

71
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,553
Hey, I need you
to give me directions.

72
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,159
You're kidding, right?

73
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,799
No, somebody stole my GPS

74
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,070
and my phone has decided that
it is spinning propeller time.

75
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,719
Can't do it.
The Nikkei just opened

76
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,592
and there's a massive
sell-off going on.

77
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,155
Oh, and by the way, I made
reservations for us Friday

78
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,759
at La Rive Gauche.

79
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,433
Wait, you'll take me
to La Rive Gauche

80
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:03,155
but you won't take the time
to give me directions?

81
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,954
What's in it for me?

82
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,230
You're kidding, right?

83
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,873
You're serious.

84
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,310
Okay, well, I'm on my way
to an ambush interview

85
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,954
of Duck Commander
Willie Robertson,

86
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,673
and I am going to
crash that party

87
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,711
and hold his feet to the fire.

88
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,480
And yesterday's discrete
web hits were over 32,000,

89
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,672
which means I am on pace for
over a million views this month

90
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,359
and my...

91
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,790
...own advertisers.

92
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,479
That's my girl!

93
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,796
Not just another pretty face.

94
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:42,115
Miss Shelley,
I've got something special for you today.

95
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,639
Think you're gonna like it.

96
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,633
Oh my, chicken!

97
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,317
I don't know when was
the last time I had chicken.

98
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,118
That would be yesterday,
for lunch and dinner.

99
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,709
Are you serious?

100
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,549
I don't think that she should
have the same thing every...

101
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,755
You think of anything else
gonna make her that happy?

102
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,358
Is it okay if I help?

103
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,394
Oh, alright, alright.

104
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,433
You're new here, aren't you?

105
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,073
It's me, Mom.

106
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,078
Mina, your daughter.

107
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,036
I'm sorry, I don't...

108
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,869
It's okay, it's okay.

109
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:54,869
I don't see a ring.

110
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,799
It's complicated.

111
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,276
I am Professor Radisson
and this is Philosophy 150,

112
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,193
Introduction
to Philosophical Thought.

113
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,874
If either of those facts
is news to you,

114
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,517
then now would be
your turn to leave.

115
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,439
I understand
some of you are here

116
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,918
to satisfy your Liberal Arts
elective requirements.

117
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,111
If you're looking for
an easy grade without much work,

118
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,312
well, then now would be
your turn to leave.

119
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,272
See, you've now enrolled
at a university.

120
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,916
You'll be expected to produce
university-level work.

121
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,317
Pfft, I'm out.

122
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,755
There's always one.

123
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,679
Michel Foucault,
Bertrand Russel,

124
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,713
Ludwig Feuerbach,
Bertolt Brecht,

125
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,229
Friedrich Nietzsche,
Ayn Rand, George Santayana,

126
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,795
Democritus,
Denis Diderot, David Hume,

127
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,673
John Stuart Mill,
Albert Camus, Richard Dawkins,

128
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,599
Sigmund Freud, Noam Chomsky.

129
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,756
The list goes on.

130
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,073
Philosophers, poets,
scientists, authors,

131
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:37,353
towering intellects,
all of them.

132
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:43,715
But what do they
all have in common?

133
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,199
Yes?

134
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,277
They're all dead.

135
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,080
Well, that would be incorrect.

136
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,955
Mr. Dawkins and Mr. Chomsky are
still very much alive, Mister...

137
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,789
G-dog Gerard Trigga.

138
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,831
G-dog.

139
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,508
Anyone else?

140
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,359
No one?

141
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:13,193
Well, they are,
or were... atheists.

142
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,279
Based on the 16th-century
French "athe'isme,"

143
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,198
from the Greek "theos,"
meaning "God,"

144
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,833
and from the prefix "a,"

145
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,758
meaning, as it always
does in Greek, "without."

146
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,030
In short, each of
the thinkers I named

147
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,834
took the strong position
that there is no God,

148
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,634
as opposed to the weak position
of agnosticism.

149
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,832
"Gnostic," from the Greek
"gnosos," to know,

150
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,837
and again, with the prefix "a"
meaning to not know,

151
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:44,040
or more accurately, to doubt the
existence of a supreme being.

152
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,189
This semester,
I propose that we refuse

153
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,392
to waste our limited time
together debating the existence

154
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,354
of the big man in the sky,
the myth of a benevolent,

155
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,996
all-powerful,
supernatural being.

156
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,873
- Hey!
- How was your flight?

157
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,672
- Wonderful.
- Wonderful?

158
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,279
It's like
a 30-hour flight.

159
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,238
Thirty-six.

160
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,879
Great to see you.

161
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,718
Nice to see you.

162
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,914
Dakar to Zurich,
Zurich to Frankfurt,

163
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,678
an 8-hour layover,

164
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,996
and direct
to Carter International.

165
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,633
Ugh, how does that translate
as wonderful?

166
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:37,278
I'm happy, I'm safe, and now
I'm here because God is good.

167
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,913
All the time.

168
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,519
And all the time?

169
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,352
God is good.

170
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,112
God is dead.

171
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,390
This is, of course, a metaphor,

172
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:54,078
but an illustrative one meaning
not that God has somehow died,

173
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,590
but rather that he never
existed in the first place,

174
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,439
other than in the depths
of our forebears' imaginations.

175
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,349
He was a useful fairy tale
in ages gone by,

176
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,439
when his fiery anger was used
to explain away plagues

177
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,437
and crop failures,
diseases and disasters,

178
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,996
which we now ascribe
to bacteria and viruses,

179
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,679
chromosomal disorders,
and plate tectonics.

180
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:22,359
In short, science and reason
have supplanted superstition,

181
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,358
and we are
all the better for it.

182
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,993
And with your permission,

183
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,270
I would like to bypass this
senseless debate all together

184
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,959
and jump to the conclusion

185
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,390
of which every sophomore
is already aware of:

186
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,949
There is no God.

187
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,355
All that I require
from each of you

188
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,551
is that you fill in
the papers I've just given you

189
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:45,834
with three little words:
"God is dead,"

190
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,473
along with your signature.

191
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,193
The sooner we reach
a unanimous consensus,

192
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,799
which I expect we will,

193
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,156
I will be spared
the tedious duty

194
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,873
of slogging through
dry and dusty arguments,

195
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,429
and you will bypass
the section of the course

196
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,471
in which students
have traditionally received

197
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:05,198
their lowest grades
of the semester.

198
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:10,599
And when you finish, please
pass your papers to the right.

199
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,912
Thank you.

200
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,472
Thank you.

201
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,990
Oh, a lower case "g."

202
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,636
Maybe this one
ought to get extra credit.

203
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,876
Thank you.

204
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,672
Excuse me, Mister...

205
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,350
Wheaton.
Josh Wheaton.

206
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,836
Mr. Wheaton,
is something wrong?

207
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,837
Yeah, I can't.

208
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,473
I can't do what you want.

209
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,113
I'm a Christian.

210
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,719
Oh, don't worry.

211
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,558
You can still go back
to your dorm room

212
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,193
and sink to your knees

213
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,799
and pray to your bedside
if you'd like.

214
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,792
What you do in your
personal life is your business,

215
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,190
but what you do
in this class is mine.

216
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,038
I can't.

217
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,675
Alright, Mr. Wheaton.

218
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:35,156
Allow me to explain
the alternative.

219
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,715
If you cannot bring yourself
to admit that God is dead

220
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,319
for the purposes of this class,

221
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,949
then you will need
to defend the antithesis

222
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,593
that God is not dead.

223
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,791
And you'll need to do it
in front of this class

224
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,036
from the podium.

225
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:52,751
And if you fail, as you shall,
you will fail this section

226
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,713
and lose 30% of your final grade
right off the bat.

227
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,832
Are you ready to accept that?

228
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,479
Well, who would decide
whether I won

229
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,636
or lost the argument?

230
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,359
Well, I would.

231
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,039
It's my class, my rules.

232
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,673
Grading's my prerogative.

233
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:13,153
No disrespect, but I'm not sure
you can be objective.

234
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,715
What would you propose?

235
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:22,031
Well, what about them?

236
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,673
Well, that's interesting,

237
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,394
but why would I want
to empower them?

238
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,999
Well, you've already
won them over.

239
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,077
I mean, I'd have to
unconvince them,

240
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,677
get them to admit
they were wrong.

241
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,240
Alright, Mr. Wheaton.

242
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,873
You'll get 3 sessions,

243
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,833
the last 20 minutes
of each of the next 3 classes,

244
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,952
to make your case.

245
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:55,233
I promise to keep
my interruptions to a minimum.

246
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,510
You may take whatever questions
you'd like from the class,

247
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,194
but I will not increase
your allotted time.

248
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,879
Of course, you'll be responsible

249
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,469
for all the other
class assignments.

250
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,352
But, you know,
you could change your mind

251
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,393
and bring in your signed
statement at our next class,

252
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:15,232
and we'll go forward as though
none of this ever happened.

253
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,274
The rest of us, having dispensed
with primitive superstition,

254
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,358
will turn our focus to
the issue of being in reality.

255
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,391
For our next class,

256
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,239
please have read David Hume's
"The Problems of Induction"

257
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,877
and Renee Descartes'
"Discourse on Method,"

258
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,038
to which you may add
Bertrand Russell's

259
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,117
"Why I Am Not a Christian"

260
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,518
in preparation
for Mr. Wheaton's lecture

261
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,269
and in thanks for his
failure to help us reach

262
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,671
a unanimous consensus.

263
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,190
You don't want
to deny your faith, I get it.

264
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,630
So, the answer's simple:
Drop the class.

265
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,513
Yeah, but I'm not sure
I can do that.

266
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,315
I feel like God wants
someone to defend him.

267
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,353
Don't be ridiculous.

268
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,879
I don't know,
I just keep thinking

269
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,911
of that C.S. Lewis line,

270
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,477
"Only a real risk can
test the reality of a belief."

271
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,194
So, you're gonna risk
our future over your yearbook quote?

272
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,796
Josh, why am I here?

273
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,434
Hello, earth to Josh.

274
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,915
Why am I, Salutatorian
of our graduating class,

275
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,917
here at my
third-choice school?

276
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,559
I'm sorry for having
the next 50 years

277
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,193
of our life planned out.

278
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,799
That's just who I am.

279
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,439
I don't know, Kara, it's just...

280
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,631
Josh, I love you,
but I absolutely forbid you

281
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,637
to go up against this professor
in his own classroom.

282
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,359
We have too much at stake.

283
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,551
The whole thing's rigged
to make you look like an idiot,

284
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,392
and if you want
to get into law school,

285
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,033
you can't afford
to flunk this class.

286
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,277
Even a "C" could be disastrous.

287
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,912
I don't know why
you wear those heels.

288
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,553
What's wrong with 'em?

289
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,193
You're too tall.
You're taller than me.

290
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,799
You're man enough to handle it.

291
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,594
I'm just saying, I don't want
to be the short guy at the prom.

292
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,233
Mr. Robertson!

293
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,873
Hi, or should I call you Willie?

294
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,519
You can call me Willie.

295
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,312
Amy Ryan,
I blog "The New Left."

296
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,953
Can I ask you a few questions?

297
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,559
Yeah, sure, fire away.
This is my wife...

298
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,153
Korie, I know.

299
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,157
I'm actually surprised
to see you here.

300
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:45,276
I thought you'd be home,
barefoot and pregnant.

301
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,199
I haven't been barefoot and
pregnant in a really long time.

302
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,833
I do kinda miss those days, huh?

303
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,678
Yeah, you want to start
again? We can try.

304
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,359
No.

305
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,993
You've made a
fortune selling devices

306
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,078
that are designed to lure
water fowl to their deaths.

307
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,117
Oh, I guess when you say "you,"

308
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,999
you're referring to the
whole group of my family,

309
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,673
which would be "y'all."

310
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,393
You can just
change it to "y'all."

311
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,033
That'd be an easier expression,

312
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,639
that way it'll get
everybody in there.

313
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,671
So, y'all have made
a fortune, isn't that right?

314
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,319
We're doing alright.

315
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,954
We can certainly buy
bigger tires on our trucks

316
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,832
and four-wheelers
to get out in the mud with,

317
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,439
so life is good.

318
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,278
What makes you think
you have the moral right

319
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,472
to go around maiming and
killing innocent animals?

320
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,631
Hey, look, let's just get
one thing straight.

321
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,273
I ain't maiming nothing.

322
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,750
Whatever I see and I aim at,
I shoot.

323
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,394
When I shoot it,
I kill it and then I eat it.

324
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,999
So, you do kill those ducks?

325
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,031
Of course I do.
What am I gonna do,

326
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,673
cook 'em while they're
still moving around?

327
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,313
That would be cruel.

328
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,919
That'd be bad.

329
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,350
So, this isn't an act? You're
actually proud of what you do?

330
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,393
Of course I am. Why would I
do it if I'm not proud of it?

331
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,033
And you go along
with everything he says?

332
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,639
We've been married for 20 years.

333
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,637
I don't go along
with everything he says,

334
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,035
but on the things
that matter, yeah,

335
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,151
I agree wholeheartedly.

336
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,511
So, what do you say to people
who are offended by your show,

337
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,239
not just because of the hunting,

338
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,671
but because you openly pray
to Jesus in every episode?

339
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,348
Hey, we're not trying
to offend anybody, alright?

340
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,989
If they don't want to watch the
show, they can turn the channel.

341
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,713
As far as my praying to Jesus,

342
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,071
my life and my whole eternity
belongs to God.

343
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:20,956
All this stuff is temporary:
The money, fame, success.

344
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,593
Temporary.

345
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,279
Even life is temporary.

346
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,232
Jesus, that's eternal.

347
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,839
Jesus said this:

348
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,957
"Whoever acknowledges
me before men,"

349
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,760
he will acknowledge
before the Father in heaven.

350
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,549
"Whoever disowns me,
I'll disown him to the Father."

351
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,354
Now, those words are written
in red so they're important.

352
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,993
And that's it?

353
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,599
That's it.
That's what we're going with.

354
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,239
Pretty simple, isn't it?

355
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,873
Thanks for your time.

356
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,479
Come on, let's go
do some acknowledging.

357
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,119
You're welcome to join us.

358
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,675
No thanks, I'm good.

359
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,279
You're good?

360
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,919
Alright.

361
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,872
Who was that lady?

362
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,350
You're beautiful.

363
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,791
I wish you
didn't have to do that.

364
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,070
It's for my father.
He's very traditional.

365
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,916
Who were you talking to?

366
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,958
No one.

367
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:06,953
Ayisha, I know it's hard
living in their world

368
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,674
and being apart from it,

369
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:14,908
a world you can see
but can't touch.

370
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,595
I know they seem happy,

371
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:27,432
but know that when you look
around at all those people,

372
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:32,953
there is no one
who worships God,

373
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,991
not the way he deserves
and demands to be worshipped.

374
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:48,039
We must never forget
who and what we are.

375
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,552
That is the most
important thing.

376
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,631
Yes, Baba.

377
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:04,320
I only insist on this
because I love you.

378
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,391
You know that, don't you?

379
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,636
That I love you?

380
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,991
Of course, Baba.

381
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,315
Can I help you?

382
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:06,312
You waiting for someone?

383
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,954
Yeah, you could say that.

384
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:13,312
It looks like he's
out at the moment.

385
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,718
Well,
maybe that's why he sent me.

386
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,758
# We are the ones and zeros #

387
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,714
# The beautiful incomplete #

388
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,358
# We are the future heroes #

389
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:45,270
# A colorful symphony #

390
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,074
# We are the ones #

391
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,679
I could drop the class,
run away,

392
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,319
pretend like it never happened,

393
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,829
which is what
my girlfriend wants.

394
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:58,192
I could sign the paper saying
something I don't believe.

395
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,039
Or I commit academic suicide
in front of a live audience

396
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,710
by trying to prove
that God exists.

397
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,832
How many people in that class?

398
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,429
Eighty maybe.

399
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,596
And how many of them
do you think

400
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,233
would ever step foot in here,

401
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,795
or any other church
for that matter?

402
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,116
Well, none probably.

403
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,231
So, your acceptance
of this challenge,

404
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,635
if you decide to accept it,

405
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,671
may be the only meaningful
exposure to God and Jesus

406
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:29,395
they'll ever have.

407
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,079
Yeah.

408
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,713
Yeah, I suppose so.

409
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,238
Check out
Matthew 10:32-33.

410
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,076
What, that's it?
That's all?

411
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,918
Yeah.

412
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,274
Just a Scriptural citation?

413
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,919
If you're still undecided
after that one,

414
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,554
look at Luke 12:48.

415
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,557
It can't be that simple.

416
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,159
Sure it can.

417
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,119
You're here because that
still small voice inside you

418
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:02,069
isn't happy with the choices
everyone else wants you to make.

419
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,077
Personally, I think it's the
Holy Spirit talking to you.

420
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,999
That's how he interacts with us
if we allow him to.

421
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,599
All you have to do is decide

422
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,552
whether or not
you're willing to listen.

423
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:14,992
It's not easy, but it's simple.

424
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,072
"So everyone who
acknowledges me before men,

425
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:58,193
"I also will acknowledge before
my Father who is in heaven,

426
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,198
"but whoever
denies me before men,

427
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:06,713
I also will deny before
my Father who is in heaven."

428
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,791
"Everyone to whom
much was given,

429
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,639
"of him much will be required,

430
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:18,116
"and from him to whom
they entrusted much,

431
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,830
they will demand the more."

432
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,273
Sorry I'm late.

433
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,869
I had to move a ton of stuff
around just to get here.

434
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,519
That's alright.

435
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,278
Please, go and have a seat
Ms. Ryan.

436
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,918
Oh, excuse me a second.

437
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,431
We've gotten your results back
from your test the last week.

438
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,873
Okay, as I was saying...

439
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,836
I'm so sorry.
I have got to take this call.

440
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,678
Amy.

441
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,194
Your results came back positive.

442
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,113
You have cancer.

443
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,310
I don't have time for cancer.

444
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,919
I'm too busy.

445
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,879
Listen, it's already
grown into the surrounding tissue.

446
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,917
Your lymph nodes are involved
and your blood markers indicate

447
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,350
evidence of distant metastasis.

448
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,551
Now, I've already
scheduled you for an MRI.

449
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,075
We need to determine
the extent of it.

450
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,077
I know you're very important

451
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,669
and the world can't
get along without you,

452
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,279
but it's my job to let you know

453
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,835
that it may be preparing
to do exactly that,

454
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:16,431
and it certainly will unless
you begin immediate treatment.

455
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,438
Do you understand?

456
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,792
Hey babe.

457
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,436
Babe, where've you been?
Did you turn your phone off?

458
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,399
More like I forgot
to turn my phone on.

459
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,756
Do you know what day it is?

460
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,552
Thursday?

461
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,432
Anything else?

462
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,791
The 13th?

463
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:07,318
Happy anniversary.

464
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:12,593
Six years ago, your youth group
collided with mine.

465
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,233
You remembered.

466
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,998
Mm-hmm, and
we're gonna celebrate.

467
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,599
You remember how we met?

468
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,189
The Newsboys.

469
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,439
They're gonna be
in town next Friday.

470
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,350
You are amazing,
which is why I love you.

471
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:33,951
Look, I know I came off probably
way too strong yesterday.

472
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,593
You know, I just...

473
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:39,110
I get concerned when outside
things start coming between us.

474
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,117
You get that, can't you?

475
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:44,232
- Sure.
- Forgive me? - Always.

476
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,072
Come on.

477
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,398
I just need...

478
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,318
Whoa!

479
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:56,198
Well, that can't
all be Statistics.

480
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,038
Josh, please tell me
you haven't been spending

481
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,708
all your time
on that philosophy thing.

482
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,236
Not all of it.

483
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,476
Okay, most of it.

484
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,159
Josh, that's not funny.

485
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,839
Okay, it's really not.

486
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,678
Look, this is something
I want to do, okay?

487
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,279
I don't understand
how it comes between us.

488
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,198
Josh, everything
you do is about us.

489
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,277
Okay, we're a team.

490
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,796
I mean, we're what, 6 years
going on forever, right?

491
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,958
That means your grades,
your whole future,

492
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,639
I'm a part of that.

493
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,150
I don't see how this
is contributing to our future.

494
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,879
Yeah, well,
neither do my parents

495
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,878
or anyone else in my life.

496
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,519
What should that tell you

497
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,153
if every single person
that loves you

498
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,477
is saying the exact same thing?

499
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,194
Josh, I'm letting you know now
for your own good,

500
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,233
this experiment is over.

501
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,635
You need to prioritize
and decide

502
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,235
who's the most important
person in your life,

503
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,989
me or Professor Radisson?

504
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,350
What if it's God?

505
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,593
God wants you with me,
so it's the same answer.

506
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,156
Return the books to the library,
sign the stupid paper,

507
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,958
and move on.

508
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:11,836
A year from now, we'll
look back on this and laugh.

509
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,314
We're not in
high school anymore.

510
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:23,479
The decisions you make now
can have real consequences.

511
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,799
Josh!

512
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,439
Josh, this is serious.

513
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,198
I know.

514
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,391
You know.

515
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,719
I can't believe I'm
making a 12-hour drive to Florida

516
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:43,549
to do things that seemed
corny when I was 12.

517
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,469
David, I promised
my mother a picture of me in mouse ears

518
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,478
standing in front
of the fairy tale castle.

519
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,274
The mouse ears are for me,
picture is for her.

520
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:58,190
To you, it's old-hat, but to me,
it's a lifelong dream come true.

521
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,231
Can you not understand that?

522
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:04,149
Then we'll go for
the undersea submarine ride.

523
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,113
Actually, I think they
closed that ride like 20 years ago.

524
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,959
And then we'll ride the
world's biggest roller coaster.

525
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,798
Sixteenth biggest.

526
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,797
In my mind, when
I'm screaming as we descend,

527
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,718
it will be the world's biggest

528
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,593
and I'll be glad that
it's not taller than it is.

529
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,313
That doesn't sound good.

530
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,199
Maybe the battery...

531
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,598
Or the starter.

532
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,678
Either way, we're not
going anywhere right now.

533
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,636
I'll call and arrange
for a rental car.

534
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,717
But how will we
get to the rental car?

535
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,359
They'll deliver it to us.

536
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,993
Are you serious?

537
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,599
Yeah, absolutely.

538
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,432
They'll deliver us
the car we are to drive?

539
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,073
Yeah.

540
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,713
Hello?

541
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,319
Amazing.

542
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,158
But there
are some flat-earthers out there

543
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,112
who still consider the
existence of a supreme deity

544
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:05,393
to be either necessary,
or self-evident, or both.

545
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,756
And with that,
as previously announced,

546
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:11,032
I will be turning the podium
over to Mr. Wheaton,

547
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,753
who will be presenting
his case in favor

548
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,633
of a supreme celestial dictator,

549
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:19,037
otherwise known as God.

550
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:24,070
Mr. Wheaton,
are you ready?

551
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,669
Podium is yours.

552
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:59,077
Atheists say that no one
can prove the existence of God,

553
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,471
and well, they're right.

554
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:07,629
But I say no one can
disprove that God exists.

555
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,512
But the only way
to debate this issue

556
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,153
is to look at
the available evidence,

557
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,191
and that's what
we're going to do.

558
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,518
We're going to put God on trial,

559
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,149
with Professor Radisson
as the prosecutor,

560
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,078
and me as the defense attorney,

561
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:33,035
and you as the jury.

562
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,958
Most cosmologists now agree

563
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,436
that the universe began
some 13.7 billion years ago

564
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,995
in an event
known as the Big Bang.

565
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,515
So, let's look
at theoretical physicist

566
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,712
and Nobel Prize winner
Steven Weinberg's description

567
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,990
of what the Big Bang
would have looked like.

568
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,953
And since he's an atheist,

569
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,072
we can be sure
there isn't any believer-bias

570
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,713
in his description.

571
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,632
In the beginning,
there was an explosion,

572
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,758
and in 3 minutes,
98% of the matter there is

573
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,076
or ever will be, was produced.

574
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,430
We had a universe.

575
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,079
For 2,500 years,

576
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,589
most scientists agreed
with Aristotle on the idea

577
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,279
of a steady-state universe,

578
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,988
that the universe
has always existed

579
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,839
with no beginning and no end,
but the Bible disagreed.

580
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:21,396
In the 1920s, Belgian astronomer
Georges Lemaitre, a theist,

581
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,999
who was actually also...

582
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,798
What's a theist?

583
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,879
A theist is someone who
believes in the existence of God.

584
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:32,556
He said that the entire universe
jumping into existence

585
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,433
in a trillionth
of a trillionth of a second,

586
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,119
out of nothingness,

587
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,153
in an unimaginably
intense flash of light

588
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,749
is how he would expect
the universe to respond

589
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,873
if God were to actually utter
the command in Genesis 1:3,

590
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:50,356
"Let there be light."

591
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,795
In other words, the origin
of the universe unfolded

592
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,275
exactly how one would expect
after reading Genesis,

593
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,114
and for 2,500 years,

594
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:05,311
the Bible had it right
and science had it wrong.

595
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,197
So,
the earliest you can get here is 5?

596
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,039
Okay, we'll be waiting.

597
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,312
Wait, it has
air conditioning, right?

598
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,476
Okay, thanks.

599
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,628
Well, looks like we won't
get there 'til late tonight.

600
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,190
Sorry, I think you're gonna
miss an entire day at the park.

601
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,833
It's okay, David.

602
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,508
I'm sure we can make good use
of our time here today.

603
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,193
Sure.

604
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,879
We can meet the choir director,

605
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,753
talk about song choices
for the upcoming concert.

606
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,758
Or we could meet
the women's club

607
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,713
about the details
for the next craft bazaar.

608
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,433
Lots of important stuff.

609
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,119
And since you're not leaving,

610
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,316
you'll have time
to meet Mina for lunch.

611
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,080
Right, I can meet
Mina for lunch.

612
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,475
Sounds like you
need this vacation more than I do.

613
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:57,036
No,
I just need to do some meaningful work

614
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:00,038
so that I can have something
to take a vacation from.

615
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,629
You know,
some of the most important work that we do

616
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,313
may seem meaningless to us.

617
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,999
This coming from the missionary

618
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,758
who literally
is in the trenches,

619
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,235
winning hearts for the Lord
on a daily basis.

620
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,989
David, God has you
exactly where he wants you.

621
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,839
He who is faithful
in a very little thing

622
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,076
is also faithful in much.

623
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,032
God knows you're doing the work.

624
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,879
It's all part
of his grand design.

625
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,116
All of which points
to a God that created it.

626
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:29,477
You see, in the real world,
we never see things

627
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,830
jumping into existence
out of nothingness,

628
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:36,591
but atheists want to make one
small exception to this rule,

629
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,472
namely, the universe
and everything in it.

630
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,557
But in his book,
"The God Delusion,"

631
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,193
Richard Dawkins says

632
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,436
that, "If you tell me
God created the universe,

633
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:50,317
then I have the right
to ask you who created God."

634
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,351
Dawkins' question
only makes sense

635
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,114
in terms of a God
who has been created.

636
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,788
It doesn't make sense
in terms of an uncreated God,

637
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,036
which is the kind of God
that Christians believe in.

638
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,673
And even leaving God
out of the equation,

639
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,871
I then have a right to turn
Mr. Dawkins's own question

640
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,275
back around on him and ask,

641
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,712
"If the universe created you,
then who created the universe?"

642
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:14,469
You see, both the theist and
the atheist are both burdened

643
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,477
with answering
this same question

644
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,558
of how did things start.

645
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,432
What I'm hoping
you'll pick up from all this

646
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:24,154
is that you don't have to
commit intellectual suicide

647
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,794
to believe in a Creator
behind the creation.

648
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,514
And to the extent
that you don't allow for God,

649
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,910
you'd be pretty hard-pressed
to find an incredible

650
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:36,716
alternative explanation
for how things came to be.

651
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,396
Well, I imagine
you're quite pleased with yourself.

652
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,909
I see you've carefully avoided
the fact that Stephen Hawking,

653
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,599
the world's most
famous scientist,

654
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,756
and who is not a theist,

655
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:57,318
has recently come out in favor
of a self-designing universe.

656
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,919
I haven't avoided it,
I just didn't...

657
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,355
You just didn't know about it.

658
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:04,028
Alright, well let's see
what Professor Hawking,

659
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,356
Lucasian Professor of physics
at Cambridge,

660
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,836
who occupies a teaching chair
once held by Sir Isaac Newton,

661
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,600
has to say about
the origin of the universe.

662
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:16,958
And I quote, "Because
there's a law such as gravity,

663
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:21,199
"the universe can and will
create itself from nothing.

664
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,231
"Spontaneous creation
is the reason

665
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,675
"there is something
instead of nothing.

666
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,599
"It's why the universe exists,
why we exist.

667
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,155
"Lt is not necessary
to invoke God

668
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,836
to set the universe
in motion."

669
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,553
End of quote.

670
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,399
So, you may have never
come across his comment,

671
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:43,991
but his point remains.

672
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,953
How do you answer?

673
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,110
I don't know.

674
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,390
You don't know?

675
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:00,313
I prick the balloon
of your entire argument

676
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:05,270
with a single pin,
and you don't know?

677
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,272
Huh.

678
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,909
Well, I mean, I'd like to tell
you I have the perfect answer,

679
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:13,271
but it doesn't shake
my underlying faith.

680
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:18,110
Okay, so the greatest
scientific mind in all of history says

681
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:21,312
that God is not necessary, but
a first-semester freshman says,

682
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,512
"Oh, yes he is."

683
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:31,068
Wow, you know, that's gonna
be a really tough choice.

684
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,554
Well, I look forward
to next week's lecture.

685
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,189
Class is dismissed.

686
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,273
Do you think you're
smarter than me, Wheaton?

687
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,112
Do you think there's
any argument you can make

688
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,316
that I won't have an answer for?

689
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,919
I never said I was smarter.

690
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,793
That's the first
intelligent thing you've said.

691
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,116
Now, I want to make this clear.

692
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,276
In that classroom,
there is a god,

693
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,119
and yep, I'm him.

694
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,515
I'm also a jealous god,
so do not try to humiliate me

695
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,676
in front of my students.

696
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,717
You know, I also checked up
on your declared major.

697
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,393
Pre-law?

698
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,113
What exactly is pre-law?

699
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,753
We don't award degrees in that.

700
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:21,953
Don't bother answering,
but know this,

701
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,232
if you truly feel a need
to continue with the charade,

702
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,591
I will make it my personal
mission to destroy any hope

703
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,679
of a law degree in your future.

704
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,758
Have a nice day.

705
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,552
- You did it, didn't you?
- What?

706
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,199
You know what I'm talking about.

707
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,992
You went and did your
argument, didn't you?

708
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,997
Yeah, yeah I did.

709
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,679
What were you trying to prove?

710
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,518
I'm not even sure
there are words to describe

711
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,153
what I'm feeling right now.

712
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:14,956
I'm sorry Josh,
but it's over between us.

713
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,276
That's it?
It's just... it's over?

714
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,436
It's over, Josh.

715
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,471
If you're going to do something
this stupid and selfish

716
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,113
after I already told you
what would happen...

717
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:26,596
Yeah, but that's sort of
the point, isn't it?

718
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,756
This is something that's
important to me, right,

719
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,433
but since it's not
important to you,

720
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,712
you made it a make-it-
or-break-it-thing for us.

721
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,554
You didn't ask me, you told me.

722
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,358
It wasn't a decision
that we made,

723
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,994
it was a decision that
you made for the both of us.

724
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,033
Well, somebody had to.

725
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,833
Okay.

726
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,156
That's it? "Okay"?

727
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,032
It's not what I want.

728
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,754
Honestly, I'm still hoping
you'll change your mind, right,

729
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,552
but I have to do this thing.

730
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,796
I feel like it's something
that God wants me to do.

731
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,833
I can't just turn away from it,
especially not now,

732
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,996
now that I've started.

733
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,277
My mother was
so right about you.

734
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:10,233
I just wish
I'd had the sense to listen.

735
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:37,799
# Oh picture it, a little girl,
just a beautiful 8-year-old #

736
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,117
# Trying to live through
this life in a crazy world #

737
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,759
Hey, Fahid.

738
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,157
# She finds herself as a teen
and her life in ruins... #

739
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:50,394
# Showed that girl she had
meaning and a purpose to life #

740
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,079
# Maybe avoid
that downward slide #

741
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:55,078
# Would you tell her the truth
or let her live in a lie? #

742
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:58,716
# It all just seems to change #

743
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,077
# When you see it
as a life to save... #

744
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,435
1 Corinthians says you're saved,

745
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,911
and Christ died for our sins
according to the Scriptures,

746
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:11,714
that he was buried, that he
was raised on the third day

747
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,558
according to the Scriptures.

748
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,035
If you believe this
in your heart,

749
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,719
if you accept this by faith,

750
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,558
you see, God will forgive you,
he'll cleanse you,

751
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,398
and he'll set you free.

752
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,032
Give me that!

753
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,872
Give me that!

754
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:07,072
You must never tell Baba.

755
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:09,356
Swear to me
you will never say anything.

756
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,312
Swear it!

757
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,194
Bottle of Cristal, my table.

758
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,038
Yes, Mr. Shelley.

759
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,875
I have some news.

760
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,513
Me too.

761
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:45,711
Okay, but me first.

762
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,276
I've just been named partner.

763
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:56,270
I think I have cancer.

764
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:04,837
Did you hear me?

765
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,793
Did you hear what I just said?

766
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,195
I have cancer.

767
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,199
This couldn't wait
until tomorrow?

768
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,038
What?

769
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:21,677
How can you say that to me?

770
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,440
I thought you loved me.

771
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:29,111
I do, but you're
changing our agreement,

772
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,952
you're breaking our deal.

773
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,760
You make it sound like
a contract negotiation.

774
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,393
Well, what did you
think this was?

775
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,079
I thought it was love.

776
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,157
Grow up, Amy.

777
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:43,319
Love is the most overused word
in the English language.

778
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,875
It's what we say
when we want something,

779
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:47,479
when we need something,

780
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:51,070
and you're as guilty of it
as anybody.

781
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,992
We had fun.

782
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,839
You were my hot, young
girlfriend with the chic job.

783
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:06,194
I was your upwardly mobile,
charming, successful boyfriend.

784
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:09,557
And we were together
because we each got something

785
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,558
out of the relationship
that we wanted,

786
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,432
and it was good.

787
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,313
It was...
actually, it was great.

788
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:21,877
But now it's over.

789
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:25,351
How did I not see this in you?

790
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:28,791
Because you saw what you wanted.

791
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,629
You understand that I might die?

792
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,917
And I'm sorry about that.

793
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:03,880
Hey, you're in
my philosophy class.

794
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:05,599
Martin, right?

795
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:08,951
Correct,
and you're Mr. Josh.

796
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:10,593
Yeah.

797
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:15,038
Yeah, that's me,
Mr. Josh.

798
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:16,878
Hey, is that on
our reading list?

799
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,352
No.

800
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:26,275
Can I ask you a question?

801
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:29,114
Yeah, sure.

802
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:34,275
Why are you doing
what you are doing?

803
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,392
Everyone else thinks I'm crazy.

804
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,637
My girlfriend...
ex-girlfriend left me over it.

805
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:44,115
My parents
don't want me to risk it.

806
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,719
At the end of it all,

807
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,359
I'm gonna have to
work like a dog

808
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:48,993
for the rest of the semester

809
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,350
just to catch up
on my other classes.

810
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:54,199
You have described
your difficulties,

811
00:49:54,400 --> 00:50:00,191
but you haven't answered
my question of why.

812
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,833
I don't know.

813
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,953
I just... I think of Jesus
as my friend.

814
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:10,392
So, you think Jesus is God?

815
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,795
Yeah, and the Son of God.

816
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,433
I don't want to disappoint him,

817
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,996
even if everyone
thinks I should.

818
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:22,313
See, to me, he's not dead.

819
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:25,512
He's alive.

820
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:27,950
I don't want anyone to get
talked out of believing in him

821
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:32,756
just because some professor
thinks they should.

822
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,356
See you around, Martin.

823
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,994
Bye.

824
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,033
Hiya, Tom Blanchard,
Metro City Auto.

825
00:50:58,280 --> 00:50:59,679
Here's your keys.

826
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:02,314
- Thank you.
- Satisfaction is guaranteed.

827
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,590
Do I need to sign something?

828
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,394
Absolutely.
I'm giving you a car.

829
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,192
Sign here,

830
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:12,915
and then one more right there,
and one more there.

831
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:16,476
And if you could just initial
there, there, and there.

832
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:18,113
Thank you.

833
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:20,311
Call us when you're back.
You have it for the weekend.

834
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:21,953
We'll come pick you up.

835
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,798
Thanks.

836
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,239
You're kidding.

837
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:38,719
What did you do?
Did you break it?

838
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,353
What?

839
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,676
Check and see
if it's still in gear.

840
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,313
No, it's in park.

841
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:47,717
I don't understand.
It worked 5 minutes ago.

842
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:51,117
Alright, well, now it's not.

843
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,833
How soon can you
get us another car?

844
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:54,479
Well, not tonight.

845
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:56,193
It's already after 5:30.

846
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,833
Everyone's gone home

847
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:02,158
and I'm already kind of late
for an audition.

848
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,793
An audition?

849
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,197
Yeah, the gang and I
are doing "Death of a Salesman"

850
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:11,313
and it's kind of
a dinner theatre thing.

851
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:13,835
What happened
to satisfaction guaranteed?

852
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:17,077
It's alright, David.
We can leave tomorrow.

853
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:19,550
You want to make this drive
and miss half the day?

854
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,591
Perhaps it's gonna rain anyway.

855
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:25,839
Forecast for tomorrow
is 82 and sunny at 9 a.m.

856
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,871
Sometimes you
don't make any sense.

857
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:30,111
Sometimes you make too much.

858
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:33,392
Just remember, God is good.

859
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,033
All the time.

860
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:36,639
And all the time?

861
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:39,348
God is good.

862
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:42,916
Will you sign this
saying you reject the car?

863
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,677
You're on with Marc.

864
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:06,075
It's me, dork, your sister.

865
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:08,276
Oh, and this is about?

866
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:09,879
You really should go see Mom.

867
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,519
She's not doing well.

868
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:13,153
She hasn't been
doing well for years.

869
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,759
That's why they
call it dementia.

870
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,399
Still, you should go see her.

871
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,318
Claire said you haven't
been there in awhile.

872
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:19,953
Like it matters?

873
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:23,197
Besides, I just
bought her a new TV.

874
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,958
Look, I'll make you a deal.

875
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,196
You go and you ask her
what 3 + 3 equals.

876
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,960
If she gives you the
right answer, I'll visit.

877
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,593
That's not fair.

878
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,199
Life's not fair.
I gotta go.

879
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,833
Say hi to Amy.

880
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,473
No, that's over.

881
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,079
What'd you do?

882
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:39,918
Unresolved personal issues.

883
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:42,190
She's got some stuff
she's gotta work through.

884
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:43,953
I'm sorry to hear that.

885
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,310
Well, that's the way it goes.

886
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,157
Okay, ready to get this started?

887
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,473
Seriously, you
have got to get a life.

888
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:07,148
Yeah, tell me about it.

889
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:12,553
Hey honey.

890
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:14,318
Oh, sorry, the door was open.

891
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,516
I just let myself in.

892
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,312
- Hi.
- Hi.

893
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:24,195
Oh hey, did you pick up
the bottle of wine I wanted?

894
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,119
I did.

895
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:31,397
I left it in the car.

896
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:32,999
It's in the car.

897
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:34,832
Don't worry about it.

898
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:36,479
You have a lot on your plate.

899
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:38,113
So, you know, just...

900
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:41,835
thank you for helping
set up our dinner party.

901
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:44,952
Well, unless I'm wrong,

902
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:47,071
all the guests are from
the philosophy department?

903
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,397
That's not true.
Vivian's a sociologist.

904
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:51,993
You're proving my point.

905
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:54,077
Look, I can't help it.

906
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:57,397
See, my intellectual rigor
falls to pieces

907
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:59,471
the instant I get around you.

908
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:01,079
Really?

909
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:02,759
You could have fooled me.

910
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,315
The first time I walked
into your classroom,

911
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:08,318
you were all blood and thunder.

912
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:14,311
That was a performance,
staged largely for your benefit.

913
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:19,594
In the mean time, I kept
trying to keep my eyes off you

914
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:22,712
and hoping that there was
a brain inside that pretty head.

915
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,359
Why?

916
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:27,279
Well, because if there wasn't,
then, you know,

917
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:31,439
there's no way I could have
made myself go out with you.

918
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,911
Look, as it was, I waited
until you aced the midterm.

919
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,553
It was an A-minus.

920
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:39,228
Close enough.

921
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:46,756
Come on, where is she?

922
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:48,393
Huh?

923
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:49,999
Who?

924
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:51,992
That carefree,
free-spirited girl

925
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:58,509
who forced me to almost
risk my career by dating her.

926
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:01,188
You know, the one who quoted
Emily Dickinson, and Shelley,

927
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:04,312
and Spongebob Squarepants
with equal self-confidence.

928
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:07,956
I mean, what ever happened
to the old Mina?

929
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:11,357
'Cause I miss her.

930
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:14,757
She has got a mom who's failing,

931
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,997
she's sensing
time is passing by,

932
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:24,912
and she's starting to wonder
if she's unequally yoked.

933
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:29,432
Alright, you've been
reading again, haven't you?

934
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:34,794
Reading, listening, thinking.

935
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,592
You can hardly
call this thinking.

936
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:40,554
As a matter of fact,
it's the opposite of thinking.

937
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,990
You know I'm a Christian.

938
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,838
You knew that when
you first started seeing me.

939
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:47,992
Yes, and you know that I'm not.

940
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,599
Yeah, I know,

941
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,239
and I know
there's a lot of things

942
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:52,873
you don't want to talk about,

943
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:54,479
so we don't talk about them.

944
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:58,554
Yeah, except the not talking
is starting to get louder

945
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:00,910
and louder, and soon
it will be deafening,

946
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:06,638
and I don't know
if I can put up with that.

947
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:10,913
- I know.
- Do you? - Yeah.

948
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:13,509
Because we need
to be clear on this.

949
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:15,995
There's only room
in this relationship for two,

950
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,639
which means
I don't get a mistress

951
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:20,673
and you don't get to drag a
2,000-year-old dead carpenter

952
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:23,713
turned itinerant rabbi
into our lives.

953
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:26,758
Look, I'm gonna go freshen up.

954
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,553
Is this the same car?

955
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,273
Oh, no sir.
No, sir.

956
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,033
Same model, different color.

957
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:46,673
The other one was a Cabernet.

958
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,475
This is more of a Merlot.

959
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:52,557
You know, lying's not good.

960
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:55,479
Lying to an ordained minister
is flat-out bad.

961
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,079
You know that, right?

962
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,436
Sir, I assure you this
is a different automobile.

963
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:02,393
Here, try it out.

964
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,313
How'd your audition go?

965
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:08,953
Oh, pretty good.

966
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:14,154
I'm up for the role of Biff,
so... thanks for asking.

967
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:36,312
You guys going somewhere?

968
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,431
How's it look for you with
the department chair position?

969
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:41,631
I'm up for review
mid-semester.

970
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:43,831
Dean Powell assures me
it's a slam dunk.

971
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:46,799
Well, congratulations Jeffrey.

972
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:50,112
Anything else on your plate?

973
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,197
Not really.

974
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:57,076
Feel like sharing?

975
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:01,876
I've got this student in my
introductory class this semester

976
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:04,594
who's... well,
he's taken a challenge

977
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:07,553
to prove the existence of God.

978
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,159
In your classroom?

979
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:12,113
- Yes.
- Silly boy.

980
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:14,430
- Freshman?
- Oh yeah.

981
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,551
Doesn't seem quite fair to me.

982
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,159
Well, how's that?

983
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,436
He's inexperienced
in front of a room,

984
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,039
and you're expecting him
to compete with you

985
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:23,838
in your own field of expertise.

986
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:26,310
Come on, Mina.
This is fun for me.

987
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:29,193
I can't help it if a boy
wants to make a fool of himself

988
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:31,311
and commit academic suicide.

989
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:32,953
Look, I tried to stop him.

990
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:34,752
I gave him an out,
but no, no, no,

991
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,560
he wants to prove
that God isn't dead.

992
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:43,753
Look, I know I am
in the minority here,

993
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:46,713
but I actually believe in God.

994
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:55,915
Yes, yes, well, she is...
she's a work in progress.

995
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,910
So, darling, I think it's best
we just change the subject.

996
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:01,553
But I'm just saying...

997
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:05,719
Mina, I've asked politely, okay?

998
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:09,438
Okay.

999
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:12,799
The coq Au vin is almost done.

1000
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:14,712
Excellent.

1001
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:16,632
To the dining room.

1002
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:57,594
Nothing like a
nice Merlot to take the edge off.

1003
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,514
Cheers, everyone.

1004
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:08,478
Mina, this wine is awful.

1005
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,119
It's been cooked.

1006
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:13,153
It tastes like it was
sunning in a moldy basement.

1007
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:15,112
Talk about your
"Grapes of Wrath."

1008
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,878
I bought it before
I went shopping the other day.

1009
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:26,958
I locked it in the trunk

1010
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,873
and when I got home
I forgot about it.

1011
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:33,590
Well, I think this dinner
serves as a valuable lesson.

1012
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:36,189
As Socrates put it
over 2,000 years ago,

1013
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,153
"Gnothi seauton."

1014
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:44,514
Looks like it's Greek to her.

1015
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:47,718
Oh,
it's "Know thyself," darling, know thyself.

1016
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:53,199
Which I suggest means
knowing your own limitations.

1017
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:06,075
You know,
if you'll all excuse me,

1018
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:09,232
it's time for
the help to depart.

1019
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:11,271
Sweetheart...

1020
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:43,952
No pacemaker?

1021
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:47,357
No other piercings, right?

1022
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:48,959
No.

1023
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,589
I know it
sounds crazy, but I have to ask.

1024
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:53,438
If there's any ferrous metal
anywhere inside your body,

1025
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:57,235
the magnetic field
will put it out, and forcibly.

1026
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:08,557
In our last class,
I was asked a question

1027
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:11,360
that I couldn't answer.

1028
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:13,949
As Professor Radisson
pointed out,

1029
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:16,071
Stephen Hawking is an atheist.

1030
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:17,918
He also wrote a book
called "The Grand Design"

1031
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:22,750
in which he says the following:

1032
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:25,076
"Because there is a law
such as gravity,

1033
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:29,677
the universe can and will
create itself from nothing."

1034
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:33,395
And to be honest, I didn't
know how to refute that.

1035
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:40,392
I mean, after all,
Hawking is clearly a genius.

1036
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:43,068
But, Professor John Lennox,

1037
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:44,679
who teaches mathematics
and philosophy

1038
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:47,639
has demonstrated that
there are not one, even two,

1039
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:50,030
but three errors
of logic contained

1040
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:51,719
in that one simple sentence,

1041
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:55,549
and it all boils down
to circular reasoning.

1042
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:58,320
Hawking is basically saying
that the universe exists

1043
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:00,710
because the universe
needed to exist,

1044
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,319
and because the universe
needed to exist,

1045
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:05,438
it therefore created itself.

1046
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:07,039
It's like this.

1047
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:08,872
If I say to you that I can prove

1048
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:10,991
that Spam is the best-tasting
food that's ever existed

1049
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:14,596
because in all of history,
no food has ever tasted better,

1050
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:16,233
you'd probably
look at me strange

1051
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:17,839
and say I haven't
proven anything.

1052
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:19,479
And you'd be right,

1053
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:21,796
all I've done is
restate my original claim.

1054
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:23,792
But when Hawking claims
that the universe created itself

1055
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:26,190
because it needed
to create itself,

1056
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,231
and then offers that
as an explanation

1057
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:30,510
as to how
and why it was created,

1058
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:33,911
we don't immediately recognize
that he's doing the same thing.

1059
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:37,271
But he is, prompting
Lennox to further comment,

1060
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:38,959
"Nonsense remains nonsense,

1061
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:41,879
"even when spoken
by famous scientists

1062
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:43,559
"even though the general public

1063
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:45,159
assumes they are
statements of science."

1064
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:46,879
This is the height of hubris.

1065
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:48,513
Are you telling me
that you, a freshman,

1066
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:50,597
are saying that
Stephen Hawking is wrong?

1067
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:53,917
No, what I'm saying
is that John Lennox,

1068
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:55,559
a professor of mathematics
and philosophy,

1069
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,716
has found Professor Hawking's
reasoning to be faulty,

1070
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:59,512
and I agree with his logic.

1071
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:02,188
But if you
can't bear to disagree

1072
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:03,799
with Hawking's thinking,

1073
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:06,270
then I suggest that you
turn to page five of his book,

1074
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:10,314
where he insists
philosophy is dead.

1075
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,838
And if you're so sure

1076
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:14,439
of Professor Hawking's
infallibility,

1077
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:16,079
and philosophy really is dead,

1078
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:22,116
then well, there's really
no need for this class.

1079
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:29,559
It's like I'm
a convenience to him,

1080
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:32,320
except for when
my faith comes up,

1081
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:34,476
then he becomes
verbally abusive.

1082
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:36,716
I'm guessing he's bright.

1083
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:38,353
Brilliant.

1084
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:40,073
Handsome.

1085
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:41,679
Yes.

1086
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:44,348
And his attention
makes you feel special,

1087
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:46,835
gives you a sense
of completeness.

1088
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:49,435
Have you been reading my diary?

1089
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:52,074
Psychologists call it
the Cinderella complex.

1090
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:55,033
It's not my name for it,
so don't get upset with me.

1091
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:56,514
Guys are capable
of the same thing.

1092
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:58,796
It's just they don't
have a name for it.

1093
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,479
But in essence,
you're looking for his approval

1094
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,073
to give you
a sense of self-worth

1095
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:04,316
instead of
generating it internally.

1096
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:06,152
Don't most people do that?

1097
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:08,749
Yeah, a lot of people do, sure.

1098
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:10,598
But, using romance
to shore up self-image

1099
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,473
is an unstable foundation.

1100
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:16,911
Do you believe God's capable
of error, bias, or bad judgment?

1101
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:18,553
No.

1102
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:21,479
So, if he's incapable
of mistakes,

1103
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:25,673
and he made you
in his likeness and image,

1104
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:28,394
then it follows that he
cares about you, right?

1105
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:30,318
Right.

1106
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:31,999
To the point
where God's only Son

1107
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:36,557
would willingly be crucified
again for you, just you,

1108
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:38,597
if that's what was necessary.

1109
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:41,308
Well, if he loves you that much,

1110
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:45,832
who cares what
your boyfriend thinks?

1111
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:51,717
To the wrong person,
you'll never have any worth.

1112
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:58,632
But to the right person,
you'll mean everything.

1113
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,468
Ladies and
gentlemen of the jury,

1114
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:08,752
for the last 150 years,
Darwinists have been saying

1115
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,594
that God is unnecessary
to explain man's existence

1116
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:14,189
and that evolution replaces God,

1117
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,277
but evolution only
tells you what happens

1118
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:18,198
once you have life.

1119
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:20,550
So, where did that something
that's alive come from?

1120
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:22,870
Well, Darwin
never really addressed it.

1121
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:25,230
He assumed maybe some
lightning hit a stagnant pool

1122
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:26,873
full of the right kind
of chemicals

1123
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:29,514
and bingo, a living something.

1124
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:32,154
But it's just not that simple.

1125
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:35,472
You see, Darwin claimed that the
ancestry of all living things

1126
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:38,877
came from that one
single, simple organism

1127
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:41,435
which reproduced and
was slowly modified over time

1128
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:43,790
into the complex life forms
we view today.

1129
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,753
Which is why, after
contemplating his own theory,

1130
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:49,315
Darwin uttered
his famous statement,

1131
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:51,272
"Natura non facit saltum,"

1132
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:56,713
meaning,
"Nature does not jump."

1133
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:58,951
Well, as noted author
Lee Strobel pointed out,

1134
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:02,197
that if you can picture
the entire 3.8 billion years

1135
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:04,436
that scientists say
life has been around

1136
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:06,113
as one 24-hour day,

1137
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:08,788
in the space of
just about 90 seconds,

1138
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,991
most major animal groups
suddenly appear

1139
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:12,633
in the forms in which
they currently hold.

1140
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:15,149
Not slowly and steadily
as Darwin predicted,

1141
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:19,791
but in evolutionary terms,
almost instantly.

1142
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,992
So, "nature does
not jump" becomes

1143
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:26,915
"nature makes
a giant leap."

1144
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:29,196
So, how do theists
explain this sudden outburst

1145
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:31,755
of new biological information?

1146
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,594
"And God said, 'Let the water
teem with living creatures

1147
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:36,233
"'and let birds
fly above the earth

1148
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:37,998
across the expanse
of the sky.'

1149
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:39,838
"So God created the
great creatures of the sea

1150
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:41,439
"and every living
and moving thing

1151
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:43,119
"with which the water teems,

1152
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:44,753
"according to its kind.

1153
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:50,830
And God saw that it
was good," Genesis 1:20.

1154
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:52,598
In other words,
creation happened

1155
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:54,518
because God said
it should happen.

1156
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:56,233
And even what looks,
to our eyes,

1157
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:59,995
to be a blind, unguided process

1158
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:05,558
could really be divinely
controlled from start to finish.

1159
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:17,758
Isn't there anyone you'd like
to have here with you for this?

1160
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:23,597
No, there's nobody.

1161
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:05,116
Lies, lies, and more lies.

1162
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:07,276
It's easy to dismiss
what you don't understand

1163
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:09,232
or what you don't
want to understand.

1164
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:15,072
There it is,
the default setting of the Bible-thumper.

1165
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:19,398
"If only you would open
the Scripture and read,

1166
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:22,478
then you would understand."

1167
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:27,470
So says the
brave young freshman.

1168
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:33,630
"For thou art wise, and with
thou, all wisdom shall die,"

1169
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:36,673
Job 12, verse 2.

1170
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:38,711
What else does Job tell us?

1171
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:42,430
"For man who is born
of woman is few of days,

1172
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:44,073
"and full of trouble.

1173
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:46,919
"He comes forth like a shadow
and does not continue.

1174
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:51,033
"So man lies down,
and does not rise

1175
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:54,391
'til the heavens
are no more."

1176
01:10:54,640 --> 01:11:00,317
Well, at least he
got that part right.

1177
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:03,791
What happened to you?

1178
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:16,638
When a 12-year-old watches
his mother dying of cancer,

1179
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:20,753
it's only natural
to beg God for her life.

1180
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,911
He'll promise anything

1181
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:25,554
to his make-believe
grandfather in the sky,

1182
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:27,711
including to love
and worship him forever,

1183
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:33,870
if only he will spare her.

1184
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:36,435
Sometimes the answer is no.

1185
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:40,195
Tell that to me the day
you lose someone you love.

1186
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:42,237
She died believing a lie.

1187
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:44,436
She died believing that
someone out there loved her

1188
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:48,952
even while he was
strangling her to death.

1189
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:53,358
A God who would allow that
is not worth believing in.

1190
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:58,111
That is why, Wheaton,
you will find

1191
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:03,394
the most committed atheists
were once Christians,

1192
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:05,352
but we took the blinders off.

1193
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:09,599
We saw the world
for what it truly is.

1194
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:13,435
You see,
Shakespeare had it right.

1195
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:17,753
Life is really a tale
told by an idiot,

1196
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:23,637
full of sound and fury,
and signifying nothing.

1197
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,911
Ayisha!

1198
01:12:56,120 --> 01:13:00,352
"He's the one god
who has not begotten."

1199
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:02,636
Say it!

1200
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:04,717
I command you to say it!

1201
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:06,353
No, Baba.

1202
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:09,757
Jesus is my Lord and Savior and
he died to save me from my sins.

1203
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:11,393
No!

1204
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:19,594
# Carry on, carry on #

1205
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:26,513
# What I know is you,
my God, are real #

1206
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:33,720
# No matter how I feel,
you've never let me go #

1207
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:40,631
# And what I know
is there will never be a day #

1208
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:43,877
# You aren't
just a breath away #

1209
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:51,080
# And through it all
I've gotta hold to what I know #

1210
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:59,598
# Gonna hold to what I know #

1211
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:08,150
# What I know #

1212
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:12,555
# What I know #

1213
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:58,868
Sorry for the delay
in posting my interview.

1214
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:03,119
It's been a rough week.

1215
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:09,475
When I finally caught up to...

1216
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:22,272
New post.

1217
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:27,076
I have cancer.

1218
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:34,152
Amy is going to die.

1219
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:54,234
No!

1220
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:33,311
Jeffrey, I need to talk to you.

1221
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:34,993
You know how I feel about that.

1222
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:38,556
On campus, I'm
Professor Radisson, okay?

1223
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:42,435
So, then he claims that Dawkins
is the one who was in error,

1224
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:45,518
as if Dawkins thought...

1225
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:49,269
Jeffrey, I'm leaving you.

1226
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:54,198
Excuse me.

1227
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:56,072
What?

1228
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:58,430
What are you saying?

1229
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:01,438
I'm leaving you.

1230
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:03,232
You can't do that.

1231
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:05,715
I won't accept it.

1232
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:09,913
I'm sorry.

1233
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:11,553
- I
- said I don't accept that.

1234
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:14,672
I won't allow it.

1235
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:23,029
I know, I heard you,
but it's not your choice.

1236
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,359
Good bye, Jeffrey.

1237
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:47,471
How long has she
been hiding her faith?

1238
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:50,234
About a year.

1239
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:54,194
I can't even imagine
what she must be feeling.

1240
01:17:56,800 --> 01:18:01,476
You asked to be
in the trenches, David.

1241
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:26,834
What have I done, Pastor Dave?

1242
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:28,632
I've lost everything.

1243
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:31,832
What if I made a mistake?

1244
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:39,670
Ayisha, you've displayed
an amazing amount of courage

1245
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:42,633
by standing up for your faith.

1246
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:47,914
God knows the risks you've taken
and he will honor that.

1247
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:53,550
I don't think I can do this.

1248
01:18:53,760 --> 01:19:00,108
We're here for you, Ayisha.

1249
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:06,395
Are you...
have you read of the Apostle Paul?

1250
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:08,955
He said, "I know
what it is to have little,

1251
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:12,118
"and I know what it is
to have plenty.

1252
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:14,880
"Ln any and all circumstances,

1253
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:17,071
"I have learned the secret
of being well-fed

1254
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:18,952
"and of being hungry,

1255
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:24,359
"of having plenty
and of being in need.

1256
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:25,959
I can do all things..."

1257
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:31,075
"Through Christ
who strengthens me."

1258
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:35,108
Right.

1259
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:38,517
You're not alone, Ayisha.

1260
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:42,110
You're gonna be okay.

1261
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:30,837
I made a mistake with you,

1262
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:32,678
letting you speak
in front of my classroom

1263
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:35,519
and spew your propaganda.

1264
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:41,278
But today, we're gonna
change things up a bit.

1265
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:51,599
Evil.

1266
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:55,998
Now, it's been said that evil
is atheism's most potent weapon

1267
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:58,470
against the Christian faith,
and it is.

1268
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:01,478
After all, the very existence
of evil begs the question,

1269
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:05,753
"If God is all-good
and God is all-powerful,

1270
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:09,151
why does he allow
evil to exist?"

1271
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:16,360
The answer at its core is
remarkably simple: Free will.

1272
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:19,640
God allows evil to exist
because of free will.

1273
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:22,354
From the Christian standpoint,
God tolerates evil in this world

1274
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:24,192
on a temporary basis
so that one day,

1275
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:26,476
those who choose
to love him freely

1276
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:28,875
will dwell with him in heaven,
free from the influence of evil,

1277
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:31,799
but with their
free will in tact.

1278
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:37,028
In other words,
God's intention concerning evil

1279
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:38,872
is to one day destroy it.

1280
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:41,680
Well, how convenient.

1281
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:45,555
"One day, I will get rid
of all the evil in the world.

1282
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:48,718
"But until then, you just have
to deal with all the wars,

1283
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:52,589
"and Holocausts, tsunamis,
poverty, starvation, and AIDS.

1284
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:54,717
Have a nice life."

1285
01:21:54,920 --> 01:21:57,639
Next, he'll be lecturing us
on moral absolutes.

1286
01:21:57,840 --> 01:21:59,319
But why not?

1287
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:02,512
Professor Radisson,
who's clearly an atheist,

1288
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:04,119
doesn't believe
in moral absolutes,

1289
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:06,880
but his core syllabus says
he plans to give us an exam

1290
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:08,513
during finals week.

1291
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:10,711
Now, I'm betting that
if I manage to get an "A"

1292
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:12,353
on the exam by cheating,

1293
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:13,959
he'll suddenly start
sounding like a Christian,

1294
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:15,593
insisting it's wrong to cheat,

1295
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:17,233
that I should have known that.

1296
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:20,000
And yet,
what basis does he have?

1297
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:23,152
If my actions are calculated
to help me succeed,

1298
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:25,316
then why shouldn't
I perform them?

1299
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:28,796
For Christians,
the fixed point of morality,

1300
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:30,678
what constitutes
right and wrong,

1301
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:34,595
is a straight line
that leads directly back to God.

1302
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:37,718
Oh, so you're
saying that we need a God to be moral,

1303
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:40,275
that a moral atheist
is an impossibility.

1304
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:42,948
No, but with no God,
there's no real reason to be moral.

1305
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:44,593
I mean, there's
not even a standard

1306
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:46,279
of what moral behavior is.

1307
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:49,318
For Christians,
lying, cheating, stealing...

1308
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:51,357
in my example, stealing
a grade I didn't earn...

1309
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:52,959
are forbidden.

1310
01:22:53,160 --> 01:22:54,593
It's a form of theft.

1311
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:56,233
But if God does not exist,

1312
01:22:56,440 --> 01:22:58,874
as Dostoyevsky
famously pointed out,

1313
01:22:59,080 --> 01:23:06,080
"If God does not exist,
then everything is permissible."

1314
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:09,550
And not only permissible,
but pointless.

1315
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:12,115
If Professor Radisson is right,
then all of this,

1316
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:16,472
all of our struggle, our debate,

1317
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:19,553
whatever we decide here
is meaningless.

1318
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:21,358
I mean, our lives
and ultimately our deaths

1319
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:23,755
have no more consequence
than that of a goldfish.

1320
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:25,359
This is ridiculous.

1321
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:26,999
So, after all your talk,

1322
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:29,111
you're saying that it all
comes down to choice:

1323
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:30,753
Believe or don't believe.

1324
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:33,554
That's right,
that's all there is.

1325
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:35,159
That's all there's ever been.

1326
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:36,992
The only difference between
your position and my position

1327
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:39,470
is that you take away
their choice.

1328
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:42,558
You demand that they choose the
box marked, "I don't believe."

1329
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:45,115
Yes,
because I want to free them.

1330
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:46,833
Because religion is like a...

1331
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:50,959
it's like a mind virus
that parents have passed on

1332
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:52,798
down to their children,

1333
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:54,951
and Christianity
is the worst virus of all.

1334
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:56,559
It slowly creeps into our lives

1335
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:59,030
when we're weak
or sick or helpless.

1336
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:00,673
So, religion is like a disease?

1337
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:03,269
Yes.
Yes, it infects everything.

1338
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:05,198
It's the enemy of reason.

1339
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:06,833
Reason?

1340
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:08,473
Professor, you left reason
a long time ago.

1341
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:10,318
What you're teaching here
isn't philosophy.

1342
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:12,039
It's not even atheism anymore.

1343
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:14,196
What you're teaching
is antitheism.

1344
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:16,032
It's not enough
that you don't believe.

1345
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:19,915
You need all of us
to not believe with you.

1346
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:21,792
Why don't you admit the truth?

1347
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,389
You just want to ensnare them
in your primitive superstition.

1348
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:26,591
What I want is for them
to make their own choice.

1349
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:28,233
That's what God wants.

1350
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:30,431
You have no idea how much
I'm gonna enjoy failing you.

1351
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:32,949
Yeah, but who are you really
looking to fail, Professor?

1352
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:37,312
Me or God?

1353
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:48,113
Do you hate God?

1354
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:49,753
That's not even a question.

1355
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:52,918
Okay, why do you hate God?

1356
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:54,553
This is ridiculous.

1357
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:57,194
Why do you hate God?
Answer the question.

1358
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:58,873
You've seen the science
and the arguments.

1359
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:00,513
Science supports his existence.

1360
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:02,915
You know the truth.

1361
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:04,792
So, why do you hate him?

1362
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,434
Why?!

1363
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:09,471
It's a very simple
question, Professor.

1364
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:12,194
Why do you hate God?

1365
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:15,676
Because he took
everything away from me.

1366
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:18,832
Yes, I hate God.

1367
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:22,874
All I have for him is hate.

1368
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:33,916
How can you hate someone
if they don't exist?

1369
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:45,553
You've proven nothing.

1370
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:47,830
Maybe not.

1371
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:53,839
They get to choose.

1372
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:04,232
Is God dead?

1373
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:29,789
God is not dead.

1374
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:32,439
God's not dead.

1375
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:33,993
God's not dead.
God's not dead.

1376
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:35,235
God's not dead. God's not dead.
God's not dead.

1377
01:26:35,435 --> 01:26:36,435
God's not dead. God's not dead.
God's not dead.

1378
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:21,278
Josh!

1379
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:26,033
Josh. Josh!

1380
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:31,031
Your decision to prove
God is not dead

1381
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:33,993
has affected me greatly.

1382
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:35,633
I'm glad.

1383
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:39,276
Yes, and it has
changed everything.

1384
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:43,479
I've decided to follow Jesus.

1385
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:46,513
That's great, Martin.

1386
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:48,153
Hey, you know what?

1387
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:50,072
You've gotta check this out.

1388
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:52,311
- Okay.
- Come on.

1389
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:55,595
Why did I
have to bring my suitcase?

1390
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:59,679
Not bringing it
would show a lack of faith.

1391
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:07,514
Oh merciful Father,
please allow this car to start.

1392
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:11,958
Amen.

1393
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:13,559
That's it?

1394
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:16,758
Why, do you have a better
"Lord, please make my car run"

1395
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:19,520
blessing that you know?

1396
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:21,119
No.

1397
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:25,359
So then, let's give it a try.

1398
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:27,835
Okay.

1399
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:29,473
No, no, no, no.

1400
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:33,434
Put our bags in the trunk first.

1401
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:38,760
David, we spend our entire lives
talking about faith.

1402
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:42,959
Now I'm asking you
to show faith.

1403
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:48,398
Okay.

1404
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:07,310
- Unbelievable.
- No. Faith.

1405
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:14,437
- God is good.
- All the time.

1406
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:19,191
- And all the time?
- God is good.

1407
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:36,712
I don't even know
what I'm doing here.

1408
01:29:36,920 --> 01:29:41,675
I mean, it's not like
you even know who I am.

1409
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:57,914
You prayed and believed

1410
01:29:58,160 --> 01:30:01,675
your whole life,

1411
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:07,000
never done anything wrong,

1412
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:10,078
and here you are.

1413
01:30:10,280 --> 01:30:16,719
You're the nicest person I know,
I am the meanest.

1414
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:23,393
You have dementia,
my life is perfect.

1415
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:26,916
Explain that to me.

1416
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:31,914
Sometimes the devil
allows people

1417
01:30:32,120 --> 01:30:36,079
to live a life free of trouble

1418
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:42,236
'cause he doesn't want them
turning to God.

1419
01:30:42,440 --> 01:30:49,073
Your sin is like a jail cell,
except it's all nice and comfy,

1420
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:53,239
and there doesn't seem to be
any need to leave.

1421
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:58,753
The door's wide open

1422
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:04,910
'til one day, time runs out,

1423
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:10,959
and the cell door slams shut

1424
01:31:11,160 --> 01:31:17,395
and suddenly...
it's too late.

1425
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:29,313
Who did you say you were?

1426
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:40,199
I can't believe this.

1427
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:41,913
The car actually starts

1428
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:44,680
and now we're being
done-in by believers.

1429
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:46,359
I think it's beautiful.

1430
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:48,079
Please, no more words of wisdom.

1431
01:31:48,280 --> 01:31:49,713
But I'm just happy to see

1432
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:51,433
all these people
going to sing about Jesus.

1433
01:31:51,640 --> 01:31:54,108
Move!

1434
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:08,516
Hello, gentlemen.

1435
01:32:08,720 --> 01:32:10,153
Can I help you?

1436
01:32:10,360 --> 01:32:11,759
I'm Amy Ryan.
I write "The New Left."

1437
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,433
Michael Tait.
How are you?

1438
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:15,073
Did we schedule this?

1439
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:18,795
No, I actually find that the
best interviews are unscripted.

1440
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,355
So, in a few minutes, you
guys are gonna go out there

1441
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:24,199
and you're gonna sing
about God and Jesus

1442
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:26,595
as if they're as real
as you and me.

1443
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:28,518
How can you do that?

1444
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:31,439
Well, to us, they are as real.

1445
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:33,551
As a matter of fact,
even more so.

1446
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:36,752
I mean, we exist
in the here and now.

1447
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:39,315
They've existed forever.
Think about that.

1448
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:42,398
Yeah, you know,
in the beginning was the Word.

1449
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:45,751
The Word was with God
and the Word was God.

1450
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:49,033
So, I see.
So when you're pressed,

1451
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:50,832
you quote a bunch of
ancient scribblings and say,

1452
01:32:51,080 --> 01:32:53,230
"Don't worry,
it's all in there."

1453
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:56,034
Well, they may be ancient,
but they're not scribblings.

1454
01:32:56,240 --> 01:32:59,357
I mean, we believe God
gave us an instruction manual,

1455
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:01,312
and it's where
we draw our strength

1456
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:04,637
and it's where we find our hope.

1457
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:07,832
So, where do you find your hope?

1458
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:19,680
I'm dying.

1459
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:29,276
Hey Amy,
you're not here to trash us, are you?

1460
01:33:29,480 --> 01:33:31,072
I think that's what
you might have done,

1461
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:34,397
but I think you're here
kinda wondering,

1462
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:40,596
kinda hoping that this stuff
is for real, aren't you?

1463
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:43,559
How do you know that?

1464
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:45,791
I just felt
that that's what God was saying,

1465
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:51,028
and he just wanted
you to know it.

1466
01:33:51,240 --> 01:33:54,949
That's... I can't...

1467
01:33:55,160 --> 01:33:58,596
Yeah, and he's just the drummer.

1468
01:34:00,920 --> 01:34:03,388
# And we never really did
what we're told #

1469
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:08,310
# And we'll say we were dumb
and all alone #

1470
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:11,318
# But we're still
chasing the sun #

1471
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:15,638
# We'll say we were young
and full of hope #

1472
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:18,752
# And we never really did
what we're told #

1473
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:23,516
# And we'll say we were dumb
and all alone #

1474
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:26,479
# But we're still
chasing the sun #

1475
01:34:26,720 --> 01:34:30,793
# One day, we'll fade
but we'll never forget... #

1476
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:17,317
"My dearest son,

1477
01:35:17,560 --> 01:35:20,279
"words cannot express
the love I have for you

1478
01:35:20,520 --> 01:35:21,919
"or the sorrow in my heart

1479
01:35:22,120 --> 01:35:24,350
"knowing that I will never
be able to see you grow up

1480
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:27,632
"and fulfill God's plan
for your life.

1481
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:30,479
"My heart is broken
at the thought of leaving you.

1482
01:35:30,680 --> 01:35:32,477
"I know God is in control.

1483
01:35:32,680 --> 01:35:34,193
"His ways are
higher than our ways

1484
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:37,039
"and his thoughts
are higher than our thoughts.

1485
01:35:37,240 --> 01:35:41,756
"Live life to the fullest and
remain in the joy of the Lord.

1486
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,275
"You will forever
be in my heart.

1487
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:47,119
I love you.
Mom."

1488
01:36:05,960 --> 01:36:07,393
Hey, it's Mina.

1489
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:09,989
Sorry I missed your call.
Leave a message.

1490
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:13,994
Mina, it's Jeffrey.

1491
01:36:14,240 --> 01:36:16,754
Please call me.

1492
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:38,039
Hey guys,
we're a-go for the show.

1493
01:36:38,240 --> 01:36:39,673
Hey Steve,
give us a minute, buddy.

1494
01:36:39,880 --> 01:36:41,279
This is kinda important.

1495
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:42,953
- Thanks guys.
- Thanks.

1496
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:45,993
Can we pray for you real quick?

1497
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:47,633
Do you mind?

1498
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:49,478
Cool.

1499
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:55,996
Dear God, we don't know
your plan for Amy, Lord,

1500
01:36:56,240 --> 01:37:00,153
but we're asking you would
save her tonight, Lord.

1501
01:37:00,360 --> 01:37:05,354
Change her, cleanse her,
give her a fresh start, Lord.

1502
01:37:05,560 --> 01:37:08,199
Let her know that she's loved,
and more importantly,

1503
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:14,157
that she is loved by you,
the Master of the universe.

1504
01:37:14,360 --> 01:37:16,954
Give her strength for
the journey ahead, Lord,

1505
01:37:17,160 --> 01:37:19,833
and let her know in her heart,
God, speak to her,

1506
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:22,998
that you're gonna be with her
every step of the way.

1507
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:26,431
We pray this, Jesus,
in your holy name.

1508
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:28,232
Amen.

1509
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:33,233
Yeah.

1510
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:35,670
Hey guys, we gotta roll.

1511
01:37:35,880 --> 01:37:37,313
Cool, you gonna be okay, Amy?

1512
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:38,999
You good?

1513
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:51,873
# Make a way for #

1514
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:59,110
# Make a way for #

1515
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:05,832
# Make a way for the King #

1516
01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:13,228
# The King is coming #

1517
01:38:31,160 --> 01:38:34,709
# Empty hearts are filling up #

1518
01:38:34,920 --> 01:38:38,469
# Wicked ways
are coming undone #

1519
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:43,714
# Every eye
is looking out for you #

1520
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:49,749
# City lights are burning out #

1521
01:38:49,960 --> 01:38:53,555
# Freedom's song
is ringing loud #

1522
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:58,709
# Dead men waking up
to the sound of you #

1523
01:38:58,920 --> 01:39:02,515
# And all our hearts can sing #

1524
01:39:02,720 --> 01:39:05,678
# All our hearts can sing #

1525
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:09,236
# Make a way for #

1526
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:13,309
# Make a way for #

1527
01:39:13,560 --> 01:39:17,553
# Make a way for the King #

1528
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:20,712
# The King is coming #

1529
01:39:20,920 --> 01:39:24,754
# So, make a way for #

1530
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:28,555
# Make a way for #

1531
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:31,792
# Make a way for the King #

1532
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:39,235
Oh, that's perfect.

1533
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:43,120
So much for sunny
and clear skies.

1534
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:05,671
Call an ambulance!

1535
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:08,717
Call an ambulance!

1536
01:40:09,880 --> 01:40:11,518
Don't move.

1537
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:14,792
His ribs are crushed.

1538
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:16,911
His lungs
are filling with blood.

1539
01:40:17,120 --> 01:40:18,758
He doesn't have long.

1540
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:20,393
Are you sure?

1541
01:40:20,600 --> 01:40:21,999
Yeah.

1542
01:40:22,240 --> 01:40:23,639
Don't move.

1543
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:25,273
I can't die.

1544
01:40:25,480 --> 01:40:27,994
I'm not ready.

1545
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:33,237
Do you know Jesus?

1546
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:36,637
I'm an atheist.

1547
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:39,872
I believe it's God's mercy
that brought me here right now.

1548
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:42,355
I'm dying.

1549
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:43,993
How can you call that mercy?

1550
01:40:44,200 --> 01:40:46,555
Because that car could have
killed you instantly.

1551
01:40:46,760 --> 01:40:49,399
And I'm sure right now
you probably wish that it did,

1552
01:40:49,640 --> 01:40:51,631
but I'm here to tell you
that it's a gift

1553
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:53,273
'cause the God
that you don't believe in

1554
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:55,511
has given you another chance,

1555
01:40:55,720 --> 01:40:58,951
another chance
to change your final answer.

1556
01:40:59,160 --> 01:41:04,553
I don't want to die,
but I'm so scared.

1557
01:41:04,760 --> 01:41:06,955
If it's any consolation,
so was Jesus.

1558
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:10,670
He was so scared,
he sweat blood.

1559
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:13,394
He asked the Father if it
could be removed from him,

1560
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:16,558
but the answer was no.

1561
01:41:18,120 --> 01:41:20,998
He says no a lot.

1562
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:22,997
He gives us
the answers we'd ask for

1563
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:27,079
if we knew what he knows.

1564
01:41:27,280 --> 01:41:30,317
"'For as the heavens
are higher than the earth,

1565
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:33,632
"so are my ways higher
than your ways,

1566
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:38,755
and my thoughts are higher than
your thoughts, ' says the Lord."

1567
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:40,632
Exactly.

1568
01:41:40,840 --> 01:41:43,434
So, the question is...
stay with me.

1569
01:41:43,640 --> 01:41:45,153
Stay with me.

1570
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:47,999
Are you willing to put
your faith in Jesus Christ?

1571
01:41:48,240 --> 01:41:51,755
Are you willing
to take that chance?

1572
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:56,789
Yes.

1573
01:41:57,040 --> 01:42:01,511
God is willing to forgive you
of your sins, all of them,

1574
01:42:01,760 --> 01:42:05,594
if you accept his Son
and ask him into your life.

1575
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:09,594
That's all you have to do
is just accept his Son.

1576
01:42:09,800 --> 01:42:13,554
Accept his love and receive
his forgiveness right now.

1577
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:19,278
Do you accept him
as Lord and Savior?

1578
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:25,197
Yes, I accept.

1579
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:32,393
It's alright.

1580
01:42:32,600 --> 01:42:35,034
In a few minutes, you're gonna
know more about God than I do,

1581
01:42:35,240 --> 01:42:36,958
or anybody else here does.

1582
01:42:37,160 --> 01:42:41,153
It's okay, it's okay.

1583
01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:11,596
If you check
out the screens behind me,

1584
01:43:11,800 --> 01:43:15,713
we have a very special message
from a very good friend.

1585
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:19,399
Hey, I'm Willie Robertson,

1586
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:22,160
speaking on behalf
of the Robertson family.

1587
01:43:22,360 --> 01:43:24,191
Me and the gang
wanted to let you know

1588
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:25,833
we've heard in the news

1589
01:43:26,040 --> 01:43:29,112
that there's been a bit of
a squabble down there on campus.

1590
01:43:29,320 --> 01:43:35,634
One of your professors insisted
that God is dead.

1591
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:39,116
Well, I'm happy to announce
that the reports of God's death

1592
01:43:39,320 --> 01:43:41,754
were greatly exaggerated.

1593
01:43:41,960 --> 01:43:43,996
Now, let me ask you a question.

1594
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:46,395
Have you got your
cell phones on you?

1595
01:43:46,600 --> 01:43:47,999
Good.

1596
01:43:48,240 --> 01:43:49,878
Alright, now while
this next song is playing,

1597
01:43:50,080 --> 01:43:52,355
I want everyone
to go to their contacts

1598
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:54,312
and click on everybody you know

1599
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:58,115
and text them
three simple words:

1600
01:43:58,320 --> 01:44:00,834
"God's not dead."

1601
01:44:01,080 --> 01:44:03,594
And there's
10,000 of you out there,

1602
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:07,037
and everyone knows
about 100 people.

1603
01:44:07,240 --> 01:44:09,356
That's a million messages
right there.

1604
01:44:09,560 --> 01:44:12,916
A million times we're gonna tell
Jesus that we love him

1605
01:44:13,120 --> 01:44:15,315
in the next 3 minutes.

1606
01:44:15,560 --> 01:44:18,393
And for the young man
who took up the gauntlet

1607
01:44:18,640 --> 01:44:22,474
to defend God's honor,
and you know who you are,

1608
01:44:22,680 --> 01:44:27,151
I can only imagine the smile
you put on God's face.

1609
01:44:27,400 --> 01:44:29,994
This one goes out to you.

1610
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:34,757
It was you, wasn't it?

1611
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:38,077
The one who defended God?

1612
01:44:38,280 --> 01:44:39,759
Yeah.

1613
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:41,399
How did you know?

1614
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:43,033
I heard you talking
in the cafeteria.

1615
01:44:43,240 --> 01:44:46,596
Only a real risk tests
the quality of a belief, right?

1616
01:44:54,960 --> 01:45:00,830
# Let love explode
and bring the dead to life #

1617
01:45:02,080 --> 01:45:09,077
# A love so bold to see
a revolution somehow #

1618
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:22,830
# Let love explode
and bring the dead to life #

1619
01:45:24,600 --> 01:45:31,358
# A love so bold to see
a revolution somehow #

1620
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:37,758
# Now I'm lost in your freedom #

1621
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:44,994
# And this world I'll overcome #

1622
01:45:45,200 --> 01:45:48,795
# My God's not dead,
he's surely alive #

1623
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:52,993
# He's living on the inside,
roaring like a lion #

1624
01:45:53,240 --> 01:45:56,198
# My God's not dead,
he's surely alive #

1625
01:45:56,400 --> 01:46:00,439
# He's living on the inside,
roaring like a lion #

1626
01:46:00,640 --> 01:46:07,273
# Roaring, he's roaring,
roaring like a lion #

1627
01:46:08,720 --> 01:46:14,955
# Let hope arise and
make the darkness hide #

1628
01:46:16,200 --> 01:46:17,872
# My faith is dead #

1629
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:23,837
# I need a resurrection
somehow #

1630
01:46:24,040 --> 01:46:29,592
# Now I'm lost in your freedom #

1631
01:46:31,680 --> 01:46:36,708
# And this world I'll overcome #

1632
01:46:36,920 --> 01:46:40,469
# My God's not dead,
he's surely alive #

1633
01:46:40,680 --> 01:46:44,719
# He's living on the inside,
roaring like a lion #

1634
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:47,793
# My God's not dead,
he's surely alive #

1635
01:46:48,040 --> 01:46:52,113
# He's living on the inside,
roaring like a lion #

1636
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:58,839
# Roaring, he's roaring,
roaring like a lion #

1637
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:02,555
# He's roaring, he's roaring #

1638
01:47:02,760 --> 01:47:09,552
# Let heaven roar
and fire fall #

1639
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:16,757
# Come shake the ground
with the sound of revival #

1640
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:23,957
# Let Heaven roar
and fire fall #

1641
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:31,557
# Come shake the ground
with the sound of revival #

1642
01:47:34,520 --> 01:47:38,399
What happened here tonight
is a cause for celebration.

1643
01:47:38,600 --> 01:47:44,038
Pain, yes, for just
a few moments, but now,

1644
01:47:44,240 --> 01:47:47,596
think about the joy in heaven.

1645
01:47:48,040 --> 01:47:50,600
# My God's not dead,
he's surely alive #

1646
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:54,873
# He's living on the inside,
roaring like a lion #

1647
01:47:55,080 --> 01:47:57,958
# My God's not dead,
he's surely alive #

1648
01:47:58,200 --> 01:48:02,273
# He's living on the inside,
roaring like a lion #

1649
01:48:02,480 --> 01:48:05,392
# God's not dead,
he's surely alive #

1650
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:09,639
# He's living on the inside,
roaring like a lion #

1651
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:12,718
# God's not dead,
he's surely alive #

1652
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:16,999
# He's living on the inside,
roaring like a lion #

1653
01:48:17,200 --> 01:48:23,753
# Roaring, he's roaring,
roaring like a lion #

1654
01:48:23,960 --> 01:48:29,717
# He's roaring, he's roaring,
roaring like a lion #

1655
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:33,754
# Roaring like a lion #

1656
01:48:33,960 --> 01:48:39,557
# Our God is alive #

1657
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:55,155
# This is a story of your life,
a movie starring you #

1658
01:48:55,360 --> 01:49:00,115
# What's the next scene
have for you to do? #

1659
01:49:00,320 --> 01:49:05,110
# Leave the dishes in the sink,
leave your fear there too #

1660
01:49:05,320 --> 01:49:09,632
# Live the story you
would write for you #

1661
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:12,229
# Say, hey, hey,
wake your heart #

1662
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:14,710
# And break, break,
break apart #

1663
01:49:14,920 --> 01:49:19,710
# The walls that keep you
from being you #

1664
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:22,229
# And walk, walk
towards the light #

1665
01:49:22,440 --> 01:49:25,830
# And don't stop
'til you live your life #

1666
01:49:26,040 --> 01:49:28,634
# Like someone died for you #

1667
01:49:28,840 --> 01:49:33,550
# This is the time to try #

1668
01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:38,834
# Just step out,
your life is waiting #

1669
01:49:39,040 --> 01:49:46,037
# And as you fall,
you'll find that you can fly #

1670
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:53,551
# This is the time to try #

1671
01:49:53,760 --> 01:49:58,754
# Just step out,
your life is waiting #

1672
01:49:58,960 --> 01:50:05,957
# And as you fall,
you'll find that you can fly #

1673
01:50:10,520 --> 01:50:15,116
# You can find a million words
to build a wall of fear #

1674
01:50:15,320 --> 01:50:20,235
# Safe behind that wall,
imprisoned here #

1675
01:50:20,440 --> 01:50:25,070
# Take that someday step today
to who you're meant to be #

1676
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:29,592
# And turn your dreams
to plans so you can breathe #

1677
01:50:29,800 --> 01:50:31,916
# Say, hey, hey,
wake your heart #

1678
01:50:32,120 --> 01:50:34,509

break apart #

1687
01:51:18,120 --> 01:51:20,998
# What they'd give
for what you've got #

1688
01:51:21,200 --> 01:51:24,749

live your life #

1689
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:27,713
# Live like your life's
worth dying for #

1690
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:30,434
# You just walked out
that prison door #

1691
01:51:30,640 --> 01:51:33,598
