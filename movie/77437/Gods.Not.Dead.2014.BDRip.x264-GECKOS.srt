You got your
pre-registration sheet?

12
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,410
Yeah.

13
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,651
All core requirements
are here.

14
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,241
What is your
humanities elective?

15
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,851
Philosophy 150.

16
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,491
Because?

17
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,400
I'd recommend Patel
or maybe Mueller.

18
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,314
Come on, man.
It can't be that bad.

19
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,485
I don't think
I can really--

20
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,330
It's your funeral.

21
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,486
Last drop date
is the 22nd.

22
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,593
You might want to
keep that in mind.

23
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,279
You're done.

24
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,111
- Hi.
- Martin Yip.

25
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,728
What does
P.R.C. stand for?

26
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,712
Oh. Seriously?

27
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,321
Oh yes, always serious.

28
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,284
Okay.

29
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,922
White &
Wolfe, how can I help you?

30
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,531
Yes, please hold.

31
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,165
White & Wolfe.

32
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,531
Thank you, bye-bye.

33
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,919
As you can on-margin.

34
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,931
You're on with Marc.

35
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,565
Hey, I need you
to give me directions.

36
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,171
You're kidding, right?

37
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,731
Can't do it. The
Nikkei just opened

38
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,604
and there's a massive
sell-off going on.

39
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,771
At La Rive Gauche.

40
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,445
Wait, you'll take me
to La Rive Gauche

41
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,966
What's in it for me?

42
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,231
You're kidding, right?

43
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,885
You're serious.

44
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,955
Of Duck Commander
Willie Robertson,

45
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,685
and I am going to
crash that party

46
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,712
and hold his feet
to the fire.

47
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,359
And my--

48
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,790
--own advertisers.

49
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,479
That's my girl!

50
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,808
Not just another
pretty face.

51
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,645
Oh my, chicken!

52
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,721
Are you serious?

53
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,359
Is it okay if I help?

54
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,406
Oh, alright, alright.

55
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,433
You're new here,
aren't you?

56
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,085
It's me, Mom.

57
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,079
Mina, your daughter.

58
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,037
I'm sorry, I don't--

59
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,881
It's okay, it's okay.

60
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:54,881
I don't see a ring.

61
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,811
It's complicated.

62
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,875
If either of those facts
is news to you,

63
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,529
then now would be
your turn to leave.

64
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,451
I understand
some of you are here

65
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,329
Pfft, I'm out.

66
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,767
There's always one.

67
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,691
Michel Foucault,
Bertrand Russel,

68
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,713
Ludwig Feuerbach,
Bertolt Brecht,

69
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,611
Sigmund Freud
N o a m C ho ms k .

70
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,757
The list goes on.

71
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,085
Philosophers, poets,
scientists, authors,

72
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:37,365
towering intellects,
all of them.

73
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:43,727
But what do they
all have in common?

74
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,211
Yes?

75
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,289
They're all dead.

76
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,080
Well,
that would be I n correct.

77
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,801
G-dog Gerard Trigga.

78
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,832
G-dog-

79
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,509
Anyone else?

80
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,360
No one?

81
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:13,205
Well, they are,
or were...atheists.

82
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,198
From the Greek "theos,"
meaning "God,"

83
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,845
and from the prefix "a,"

84
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,031
In short, each of
the thinkers I named

85
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,846
took the strong position
that there is no God,

86
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,996
all-powerful,
supernatural being.

87
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,885
- Hey!
- How was your flight?

88
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,673
- Wonderful.
- Wonderful?

89
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,291
It's like
a 30-hour flight.

90
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,238
Thirty-six.

91
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,891
Great to see you.

92
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,730
Nice to see you.

93
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,926
Dakar to Zurich,
Zurich to Frankfurt,

94
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,679
an 8-hour layover,

95
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,008
and direct
to Carter International.

96
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,925
All the time.

97
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,531
And all the time?

98
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,353
God is good.

99
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,124
God is dead.

100
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,391
This is, of course,
a metaphor,

101
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,438
and crop failures,
diseases and disasters,

102
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,008
which we now ascribe
to bacteria and viruses,

103
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,359
and we are
all the better for it.

104
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,950
There is no God.

105
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,356
All that I require
from each of you

106
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:45,846
"God is dead,"

107
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,811
which I expect we will,

108
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,168
I will be spared
the tedious duty

109
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:05,210
their lowest grades
of the semester.

110
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,913
Thank you.

111
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,473
Thank you.

112
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:48,002
Oh, a lower case

113
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,877
Thank you.

114
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,684
Excuse me, Mister--

115
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,362
Wheaton.
Josh Wheaten.

116
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,837
Mr. Wheaton,
is something wrong?

117
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,838
Yeah, I can't.

118
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,485
I can't do
what you want.

119
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,125
I'm a Christian.

120
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,731
Oh, don't worry.

121
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,570
You can still go back
to your dorm room

122
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,205
and sink to your knees

123
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,202
but what you do
in this class is mine.

124
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,050
I can't.

125
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,687
Alright, Mr. Wheaton.

126
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:35,157
Allow me to explain
the alternative.

127
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,961
Then you will need
to defend the antithesis

128
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,605
that God is not dead.

129
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,791
And you'll need to do it
in front of this class

130
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,048
from the podium.

131
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,833
Are you ready
to accept that?

132
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,491
Well, who would decide
whether I won

133
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,637
or lost the argument?

134
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,359
Well, I Would.

135
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,039
It's my class, my rules.

136
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:22,032
Well, what about them?

137
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,685
Well, that's interesting,

138
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,406
but why would I want
to empower them?

139
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,011
Well, you've already
won them over.

140
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,089
I mean, I'd have to
unconvince them,

141
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,678
get them to admit
they were wrong.

142
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,240
Alright, Mr. Wheaton.

143
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,885
You'll get 3 sessions,

144
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,953
to make your case.

145
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,195
But I will not increase
your allotted time.

146
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,879
Of course,
you'll be responsible

147
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,481
for all the other
class assignments.

148
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,392
For our next class,

149
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,889
and Renee Descartes'
"Discourse on Method,"

150
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,050
to which you may add
Bertrand Russell's

151
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,270
and in thanks for his
failure to help us reach

152
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,190
You don't want
to deny your faith, I get it.

153
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,514
Yeah, but I'm not sure
I can do that.

154
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,353
Don't be ridiculous.

155
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,879
I don't know,
I just keep thinking

156
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,912
of that (3.8. Lewis line,

157
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,808
Josh, why am I here?

158
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,435
Hello, earth to Josh.

159
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,927
Why am I, Salutatorian
of our graduating class,

160
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,918
here at my
third-choice school?

161
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,571
I'm sorry for having
the next 5 years

162
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,205
of our life planned out.

163
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,811
That's just who I am.

164
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,451
I don't know, Kara,
it's just--

165
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,393
and if you want
to get into law school,

166
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,045
you can't afford
to flunk this class.

167
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,278
Even a "C"
could be disastrous.

168
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,924
I don't know why
you wear those heels.

169
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,205
You're too tall.
You're taller than me.

170
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,811
You're man enough
to handle it.

171
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,245
Mr. Robertson!

172
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,885
Hi, or should I
call you Willie?

173
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,531
You can call me Willie.

174
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,313
Amy Ryan,
I blog "The New Left."

175
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,965
Can I ask you
a few questions?

176
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,571
Yeah, sure, fire away.
This is my wife--

177
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,154
Korie, I know.

178
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,158
I'm actually surprised
to see you here.

179
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,845
I do kinda
miss those days, huh?

180
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,690
Yeah, you want to start
again? We can try.

181
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,359
No.

182
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,005
You've made a
fortune selling devices

183
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,118
Oh, I guess
when you say "you,"

184
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,685
which would be "y'all."

185
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,405
You can just
change it to "y'all."

186
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,045
That'd be an
easier expression,

187
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,651
that way it'll get
everybody in there.

188
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,331
We're doing alright.

189
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,451
So life is good.

190
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,643
Hey, look, let's just get
one thing straight.

191
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,285
I ain't maiming nothing.

192
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,395
When I shoot it,
I kill it and then I eat it.

193
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,011
So, you do kill
those ducks?

194
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,032
Of course I do.
What am I gonna do,

195
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,685
cook 'em while they're
still moving around?

196
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,325
That would be cruel.

197
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,931
That'd be bad.

198
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,651
We've been married
for 20 years.

199
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,036
But on the things
that matter, yeah,

200
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,163
I agree wholeheartedly.

201
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,239
Not just because
of the hunting,

202
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,725
As far as my
praying to Jesus,

203
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,605
Temporary.

204
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,279
Even life is temporary.

205
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,244
Jesus, that's eternal.

206
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,851
Jesus said this:

207
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,005
And that's it?

208
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,251
Pretty simple, isn't it?

209
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,885
Thanks for your time.

210
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,687
No thanks, I'm good.

211
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,291
You're good?

212
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,931
Alright.

213
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,884
Who was that lady?

214
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,362
You're beautiful.

215
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,803
I wish you
didn't have to do that.

216
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,071
It's for my father.
He's very traditional.

217
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,959
No one.

218
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:06,965
Ayisha, I know it's hard
living in their world

219
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,686
and being apart from it,

220
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:14,909
a world you can see
but can't touch.

221
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:32,965
There is no one
who worships God,

222
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:48,039
We must never forget
who and what we are.

223
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,564
That is the most
important thing.

224
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,632
Yes, Baba.

225
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:05,171
I only insist on this
because I love you.

226
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,648
That I love you?

227
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,992
Of course, Baba.

228
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,327
Can I help you?

229
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:13,313
It looks like he's
out at the moment.

230
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,719
Well, maybe
that's why he sent me.

231
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,759
♪ We are the ones
and zeros ♪

232
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,086
♪ We are the ones ♪

233
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,691
I could drop
the class, run away,

234
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,331
pretend like
it never happened,

235
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,830
which is what
my girlfriend wants.

236
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,722
By trying to prove
that God exists.

237
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,833
How many people
in that class?

238
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,441
Eighty maybe.

239
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,597
And how many of them
do you think

240
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,245
would ever
step foot in here,

241
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,807
or any other church
for that matter?

242
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,128
Well, none probably.

243
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,243
So, your acceptance
of this challenge,

244
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:29,396
they'll ever have.

245
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,079
Yeah.

246
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,725
Yeah, I suppose so.

247
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,238
Check out
Matthew 10:32-33.

248
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,077
What, that's it?
That's all?

249
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,930
Yeah.

250
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,931
If you're still undecided
after that one,

251
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,555
look at Luke 12:48.

252
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,558
It can't be that simple.

253
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,171
Sure it can.

254
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,611
All you have to do
is decide

255
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,564
whether or not
you're willing to listen.

256
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:15,004
It's not easy,
but it's simple.

257
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,199
"but whoever
denies me before men,

258
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,803
"Everyone to whom
much was given,

259
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:18,117
"and from him to whom
they entrusted much,

260
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,285
Sorry I'm late.

261
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,531
That's alright.

262
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,885
Okay, as I was saying--

263
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,690
Amy.

264
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,206
Your results
came back positive.

265
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,114
You have cancer.

266
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,322
I don't have time
for cancer.

267
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,931
I'm too busy.

268
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,350
Evidence
of distant metastasis.

269
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,087
We need to determine
the extent of it.

270
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,078
I know you're
very important

271
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,681
and the world can't
get along without you,

272
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,291
but it's my job
to let you know

273
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,847
that it may be preparing
to do exactly that,

274
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,439
Do you understand?

275
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,804
Hey babe.

276
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,411
More like I forgot
to turn my phone on.

277
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,768
Do you know
what day it is?

278
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,553
Thursday?

279
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,444
Anything else?

280
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,792
The 13th?

281
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:07,319
Happy anniversary.

282
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,245
You remembered.

283
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,999
Mm-hmm, and
we're gonna celebrate.

284
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,201
The Newsboys.

285
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,451
They're gonna be
in town next Friday.

286
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,362
You are amazing,
which is why I love you.

287
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,605
You know, I just--

288
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,118
You get that, can't you?

289
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:44,233
- Sure.
- Forgive me?
- Always.

290
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,073
Come on.

291
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,410
I just need--

292
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,330
Whoa!

293
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:56,198
Well, that can't
all be Statistics.

294
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,237
Not all of it.

295
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,488
Okay, most of it.

296
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,159
Josh, that's not funny.

297
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,839
Okay, it's really not.

298
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,690
Look, this is something
I want to do, okay?

299
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,198
Josh, everything
you do is about us.

300
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,289
Okay, we're a team.

301
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,639
I'm a part of that.

302
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,879
Yeah, well,
neither do my parents

303
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,165
if every single person
that loves you

304
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,489
is saying
the exact same thing?

305
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,233
This experiment is over.

306
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,636
You need to prioritize
and decide

307
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,362
What if it's God?

308
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,959
And move on.

309
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,315
We're not in
high school anymore.

310
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,811
Josh!

311
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,451
Josh, this is serious.

312
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,199
I know.

313
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,391
You know.

314
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,479
Standing in front
of the fairy tale castle.

315
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,232
Can you not
understand that?

316
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,810
Sixteenth biggest.

317
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,718
It will be
the world's biggest

318
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,594
and I'll be glad that
it's not taller than it is.

319
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,211
Maybe the battery--

320
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,599
Or the starter.

321
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,637
I'll call and arrange
for a rental car.

322
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,729
But how will we
get to the rental car?

323
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,371
They'll deliver it to us.

324
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,005
Are you serious?

325
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,611
Yeah, absolutely.

326
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,433
They'll deliver us
the car we are to drive?

327
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,085
Yeah.

328
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,725
Hello?

329
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,331
Amazing.

330
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,170
But there
are some flat-earthers out there

331
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:05,405
to be either necessary,
or self-evident, or both.

332
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,765
Who will be presenting
his case in favor

333
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,634
of a supreme
celestial dictator,

334
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:24,070
Mr. Wheaton,
are you ready?

335
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,681
Podium is yours.

336
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,472
And well, they're right.

337
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,512
But the only way
to debate this issue

338
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,165
is to look at
the available evidence,

339
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,192
and that's what
we're going to do.

340
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,519
We're going to
put God on trial,

341
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:33,036
and you as the jury.

342
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,007
In an event
known as the Big Bang.

343
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,527
So, let's look
at theoretical physicist

344
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,991
of what the Big Bang
would have looked like.

345
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,725
In his description.

346
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,644
In the beginning,
there was an explosion,

347
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,088
or ever will be,
was produced.

348
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,442
We had a universe.

349
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,091
For 2,500 years,

350
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,989
that the universe
has always existed

351
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,011
who was actually also--

352
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,799
What's a theist?

353
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,119
Out of nothingness,

354
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,153
in an unimaginably
intense flash of light

355
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,761
is how he would expect
the universe to respond

356
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:50,357
"Let there be light."

357
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,126
and for 2,500 years,

358
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,209
So, the
earliest you can get here is 5?

359
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,040
Okay, we'll be waiting.

360
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,312
Wait, it has
air conditioning, right?

361
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,477
Okay, thanks.

362
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,845
It's okay, David.

363
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,205
Sure.

364
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,879
We can meet
the choir director,

365
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,759
Or we could meet
the women's club

366
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,445
Lots of important stuff.

367
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,317
You'll have time
to meet Mina for lunch.

368
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,080
Right, I can meet
Mina for lunch.

369
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:57,048
No, I just need
to do some meaningful work

370
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,999
This coming
from the missionary

371
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,759
who literally
is in the trenches,

372
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,840
He who is faithful
in a very little thing

373
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,088
is also faithful in much.

374
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,044
God knows
you're doing the work.

375
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,880
It's all part
of his grand design.

376
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,842
Jumping into existence
out of nothingness,

377
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,484
namely, the universe
and everything in it.

378
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,569
But in his
book, "The God Delusion,"

379
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,205
Richard Dawkins says

380
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,352
Dawkins' question
only makes sense

381
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,126
in terms of a God
who has been created.

382
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,685
And even leaving God
out of the equation,

383
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,478
with answering
this same question

384
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,570
of how did things start.

385
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,795
To believe in a Creator
behind the creation.

386
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,599
The world's most
famous scientist,

387
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,757
and who is not a theist,

388
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,931
I haven't avoided it,
I just didn't--

389
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,356
You just didn't
know about it.

390
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,232
"Spontaneous creation
is the reason

391
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,676
"there is something
instead of nothing.

392
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,167
"It is not necessary
to invoke God

393
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,836
to set the universe
in motion."

394
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,565
End of quote.

395
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:43,992
But his point remains.

396
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,965
How do you answer?

397
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,111
I don't know.

398
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,391
You don't know?

399
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:00,314
I prick the balloon
of your entire argument

400
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:05,282
with a single pin,
and you don't know?

401
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,284
Huh.

402
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:13,272
But it doesn't shake
my underlying faith.

403
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,524
"Oh, yes he is."

404
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,555
Well, I look forward
to next week's lecture.

405
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,201
Class is dismissed.

406
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,317
That I won't
have an answer for?

407
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,931
I never said
I was smarter.

408
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,128
Now, I want to
make this clear.

409
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,277
In that classroom,
there is a god,

410
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,120
and yep, I'm him.

411
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,677
In front of my students.

412
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,405
Pre-law?

413
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,765
We don't award
degrees in that.

414
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:21,965
Don't bother answering,
but know this,

415
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,680
of a law degree
in your future.

416
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,770
Have a nice day.

417
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,564
- You did it, didn't you?
- What?

418
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,211
You know what
I'm talking about.

419
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,993
You went and did your
argument, didn't you?

420
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,998
Yeah, yeah I did.

421
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,679
What were you
trying to prove?

422
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,288
That's it?
It's just--it's over?

423
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,437
It's over, Josh.

424
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,125
After I already told you
what would happen--

425
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:26,597
Yeah, but that's sort of
the point, isn't it?

426
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,757
This is something that's
important to me, right,

427
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,445
but since it's not
important to you,

428
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,712
you made it a make-it-
or-break-it-thing for us.

429
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,566
You didn't ask me,
you told me.

430
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,359
It wasn't a decision
that we made,

431
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,033
Well, somebody had to.

432
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,845
Okay-

433
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,168
That's it? "Okay"?

434
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,044
It's not what I want.

435
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,553
But I have to
do this thing.

436
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,997
Now that I've started.

437
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,278
My mother was
so right about you.

438
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,771
Hey, Fa hid.

439
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,079
♪ Maybe avoid
that downward slide ♪

440
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,089
♪ When you see it
as a life to save-- ♪

441
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,447
1 Corinthians
says you're saved,

442
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,047
If you believe this
in your heart,

443
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,410
and he'll set you free.

444
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,033
Give me that!

445
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,873
Give me that!

446
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,324
Swear it!

447
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,206
Bottle of
Cristal, my table.

448
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,050
Yes, Mr. Shelley.

449
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,876
I have some news.

450
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,525
Me too.

451
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:45,711
Okay, but me first.

452
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,288
I've just
been named partner.

453
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:56,282
I think I have cancer.

454
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:04,849
Did you hear me?

455
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,805
Did you hear
what I just said?

456
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,196
I have cancer.

457
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,211
This couldn't wait
until tomorrow?

458
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,050
What?

459
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:21,678
How can you
say that to me?

460
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,440
I thought you loved me.

461
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,760
You make it sound like
a contract negotiation.

462
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,405
Well, what did you
think this was?

463
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,079
I thought it was love.

464
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,169
Grow up, Amy.

465
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:51,082
And you're as guilty of it
as anybody.

466
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,004
We had fun.

467
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,559
Out of the relationship
that we wanted,

468
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,444
and it was good.

469
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,314
It was--
actually, it was great.

470
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:21,878
But now it's over.

471
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:25,363
How did I not
see this in you?

472
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:28,803
Because you saw
what you wanted.

473
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,641
You understand
that I might die?

474
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:03,880
Hey, you're in
my philosophy class.

475
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:05,599
Martin, right?

476
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:08,952
Correct,
and you're Mr. Josh.

477
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:10,605
Yeah.

478
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:15,050
Yeah, that's me,
Mr. Josh.

479
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:16,890
Hey, is that on
our reading list?

480
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,353
No.

481
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:26,275
Can I ask you
a question?

482
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:29,126
Yeah, sure.

483
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:34,287
Why are you doing
what you are doing?

484
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,404
Everyone else
thinks I'm crazy.

485
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:44,127
My parents
don't want me to risk it.

486
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,731
At the end of it all,

487
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,371
I'm gonna have to
work like a dog

488
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,362
just to catch up
on my other classes.

489
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:54,200
You have described
your difficulties,

490
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,845
I don't know.

491
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,954
I just--I think of Jesus
as my friend.

492
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,445
I don't want
to disappoint him,

493
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:18,008
even if everyone
thinks I should.

494
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:22,325
See, to me,
he's not dead.

495
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:25,524
He's alive.

496
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,995
Bye.

497
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,045
Hiya, Tom Blanchard,
Metro City Auto.

498
00:50:58,280 --> 00:50:59,691
Here's your keys.

499
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,406
Absolutely.
I'm giving you a car.

500
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,193
Sign here,

501
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:18,125
Thank you.

502
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:21,965
We'll come pick you up.

503
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,810
Thanks.

504
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,251
You're kidding.

505
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:38,731
What did you do?
Did you break it?

506
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,365
What?

507
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,688
Check and see
if it's still in gear.

508
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,325
No, it's in park.

509
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:51,129
Alright,
well, now it's not.

510
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,845
How soon can you
get us another car?

511
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:54,491
Well, not tonight.

512
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:56,205
It's already after 5:30.

513
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,845
Everyone's gone home

514
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,805
An audition?

515
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:11,314
And it's kind of
a dinner theatre thing.

516
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,592
Perhaps it's
gonna rain anyway.

517
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,872
Sometimes you
don't make any sense.

518
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,045
All the time.

519
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:36,651
And all the time?

520
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:39,349
God is good.

521
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,689
You're on with Marc.

522
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:06,076
It's me, dork,
your sister.

523
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:08,277
Oh, and this is about?

524
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:09,891
You really
should go see Mom.

525
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,531
She's not doing well.

526
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:13,165
She hasn't been
doing well for years.

527
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,771
That's why they
call it dementia.

528
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,411
Still, you
should go see her.

529
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,318
Claire said you haven't
been there in awhile.

530
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:19,965
Like it matters?

531
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:23,198
Besides, I just
bought her a new TV.

532
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,960
If she gives you the
right answer, I'll visit.

533
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,605
That's not fair.

534
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,211
Life's not fair.
I gotta go.

535
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,845
Say hi to Amy.

536
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,485
No, that's over.

537
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,091
What'd you do?

538
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:43,965
I'm sorry to hear that.

539
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,322
Well, that's
the way it goes.

540
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,169
Okay, ready to
get this started?

541
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,485
Seriously, you
have got to get a life.

542
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:07,149
Yeah, tell me about it.

543
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:12,565
Hey honey.

544
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:14,319
Oh, sorry,
the door was open.

545
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,517
I just let myself in.

546
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,313
- Hi.
- Hi.

547
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,119
I did.

548
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:31,398
I left it in the car.

549
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:33,011
It's in the car.

550
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:34,833
Don't worry about it.

551
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:36,491
You have a lot
on your plate.

552
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:38,125
So, you know, just--

553
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:41,836
thank you for helping
set up our dinner party.

554
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:44,953
Well, unless I'm wrong,

555
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,409
That's not true.
Vivian's a sociologist.

556
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:54,089
Look, I can't help it.

557
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:59,472
The instant
I get around you.

558
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:01,091
Really?

559
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,327
The first time I walked
into your classroom,

560
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:08,319
you were all
blood and thunder.

561
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,371
Why?

562
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,565
It was an A-minus.

563
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:39,229
Close enough.

564
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:48,405
Huh?

565
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,011
Who?

566
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,004
That carefree,
free-spirited girl

567
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:11,369
'Cause I miss her.

568
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:14,769
She has got a mom
who's failing,

569
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,998
she's sensing
time is passing by,

570
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:34,806
Reading, listening,
thinking.

571
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,593
You can hardly
call this thinking.

572
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:47,993
Yes, and you know
that I'm not.

573
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,611
Yeah, I know,

574
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,251
and I know
there's a lot of things

575
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:52,885
you don't want
to talk about,

576
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:54,491
so we don't
talk about them.

577
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:00,922
And louder, and soon
it will be deafening,

578
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:06,650
and I don't know
if I can put up with that.

579
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:10,925
- I know.
- Do you?
- Yeah.

580
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:13,521
Because we need
to be clear on this.

581
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,651
Which means
I don't get a mistress

582
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:23,713
turned itinerant rabbi
into our lives.

583
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:26,759
Look, I'm gonna
go freshen up.

584
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,565
Is this the same car?

585
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,285
Oh, no sir.
No, sir.

586
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,045
Same model,
different color.

587
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:46,685
The other one
was a Cabernet.

588
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,487
This is more
of a merlot.

589
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:52,569
You
know, lying's not good.

590
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,091
You know that, right?

591
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,448
Sir, I assure you this
is a different automobile.

592
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:02,405
Here, try it out.

593
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:08,965
Oh, Pretty good.

594
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:41,631
I'm up for review
mid-semester.

595
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:46,811
Well,
congratulations Jeffrey.

596
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:50,112
Anything else
on your plate?

597
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,209
Not really.

598
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:57,088
Feel like sharing?

599
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:04,606
Who's--well,
he's taken a challenge

600
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:07,565
to prove
the existence of God.

601
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,171
In your classroom?

602
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:12,125
- Yes.
- Silly boy.

603
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:14,431
- Freshman?
- Oh yeah.

604
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,563
Doesn't seem
quite fair to me.

605
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,171
Well, how's that?

606
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,448
He's inexperienced
in front of a room,

607
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:23,839
in your own field
of expertise.

608
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:26,310
Come on, Mina.
This is fun for me.

609
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:34,753
I gave him an out,
but no,no,no,

610
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,560
he wants to prove
that God isn't dead.

611
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:43,754
Look, I know I am
in the minority here,

612
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:46,725
but I actually
believe in God.

613
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:01,565
But I'm just saying--

614
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:05,731
Mina, I've asked
politely, okay?

615
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:09,450
Okay-

616
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:12,811
The coq au vin
is almost done.

617
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:14,724
Excellent.

618
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:16,644
To the dining room.

619
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,526
Cheers, everyone.

620
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:08,478
Mina, this wine is awful.

621
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,131
It's been cooked.

622
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:15,124
Talk about your
"Grapes of Wrath."

623
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:26,970
I locked it in the trunk

624
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,874
and when I got home
I forgot about it.

625
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:36,201
As Socrates put it
over 2,000 years ago,

626
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,165
"Gnothi seauton."

627
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:44,515
Looks like
it's Greek to her.

628
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:47,730
Oh, it's "Know
thyself," darling, know thyself.

629
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:06,087
You know,
if you'll all excuse me,

630
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:09,233
it's time for
the help to depart.

631
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:11,272
Sweetheart--

632
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:43,964
No pacemaker?

633
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:48,971
No.

634
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,601
I know it
sounds crazy, but I have to ask.

635
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:08,558
In our last class,
I was asked a question

636
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:11,360
that I couldn't answer.

637
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:13,961
As Professor Radisson
pointed out,

638
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:22,751
in which he says
the following:

639
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:25,088
"Because there is a law
such as gravity,

640
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:50,042
but three errors
of logic contained

641
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:55,561
and it all boils down
to circular reasoning.

642
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:00,722
Because the universe
needed to exist,

643
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:07,051
It's like this.

644
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:08,873
If I say to you
that I can prove

645
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:16,245
you'd probably
look at me strange

646
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:17,851
and say I haven't
proven anything.

647
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:19,491
And you'd be right,

648
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:26,202
because it needed
to create itself,

649
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,232
and then offers that
as an explanation

650
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:30,511
as to how
and why it was created,

651
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:41,891
"even when spoken
by famous scientists

652
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:43,559
"even though
the general public

653
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:45,171
assumes they are
statements of science."

654
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:48,525
Are you telling me
that you, a freshman,

655
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:53,929
No, what I'm saying
is that John Lennox,

656
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:02,189
But if you
can't bear to disagree

657
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:10,326
where he insists
philosophy is dead.

658
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,850
And if you're so sure

659
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:14,451
of Professor Hawking's
infallibility,

660
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:16,091
and philosophy
really is dead,

661
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:22,117
then well, there's really
no need for this class.

662
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:32,320
Except for when
my faith comes up,

663
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:34,477
then he becomes
verbally abusive.

664
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:38,365
Brilliant.

665
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:40,085
Handsome.

666
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:41,691
Yes.

667
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:44,349
And his attention
makes you feel special,

668
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:46,847
gives you a sense
of completeness.

669
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:49,447
Have you been
reading my diary?

670
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:52,075
Psychologists call it
the Cinderella complex.

671
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:56,526
Guys are capable
of the same thing.

672
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:58,808
It's just they don't
have a name for it.

673
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,074
To give you
a sense of self-worth

674
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:04,328
instead of
generating it internally.

675
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:08,761
Yeah, a lot
of people do, sure.

676
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:10,610
But, using romance
to shore up self-image

677
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:18,565
No.

678
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:21,491
So, if he's incapable
of mistakes,

679
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:28,406
then it follows that he
cares about you, right?

680
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:30,318
Right.

681
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:31,999
To the point
where God's only Son

682
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:38,598
if that's what
was necessary.

683
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:41,309
Well, if he
loves you that much,

684
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:45,844
who cares what
your boyfriend thinks?

685
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:58,633
But to the right person,
you'll mean everything.

686
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,469
Ladies and
gentlemen of the jury,

687
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:14,201
and that evolution
replaces God,

688
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,289
but evolution only
tells you what happens

689
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:18,198
once you have life.

690
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:26,885
Full of the right kind
of chemicals

691
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:29,515
and bingo,
a living something.

692
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:38,889
Came from that one
single, simple organism

693
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:49,327
Darwin uttered
his famous statement,

694
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:04,448
that scientists say
life has been around

695
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:06,125
as one 24-hour day,

696
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:08,789
in the space of
just about 9 seconds,

697
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:12,645
in the forms in which
they currently hold.

698
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:15,150
Not slowly and steadily
as Darwin predicted,

699
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,004
So, "nature does
not jump" becomes

700
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:26,915
"nature makes
a giant leap."

701
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:36,245
"'and let birds
fly above the earth

702
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:37,999
across the expanse
of the sky.'

703
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:41,451
"and every living
and moving thing

704
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:43,119
"with which
the water teems,

705
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:44,765
"according to its kind.

706
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:52,599
In other words,
creation happened

707
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:54,518
because God said
it should happen.

708
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:56,245
And even what looks,
to our eyes,

709
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:59,996
to be a blind,
unguided process

710
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:23,598
No, there's nobody.

711
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:09,244
Or what you don't
want to understand.

712
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:19,399
"If only you would open
the Scripture and read,

713
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:27,470
So says the
brave young freshman.

714
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:36,673
Job 12, verse 2.

715
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:44,085
"And full of trouble.

716
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:51,034
"So man lies down,
and does not rise

717
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:54,392
'til the heavens
are no more."

718
01:10:54,640 --> 01:11:00,329
Well, at least he
got that part right.

719
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:20,754
It's only natural
to beg God for her life.

720
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,923
He'll promise anything

721
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:25,555
to his make-believe
grandfather in the sky,

722
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:33,882
if only he will spare her.

723
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:42,238
She died believing a lie.

724
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:48,964
Even while he was
strangling her to death.

725
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:58,111
That is why, Wheaton,
you will find

726
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:05,364
but we took
the blinders off.

727
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:09,599
We saw the world
for what it truly is.

728
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:17,765
Life is really a tale
told by an idiot,

729
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:23,649
full of sound and fury,
and signifying nothing.

730
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,923
Ayisha!

731
01:12:56,120 --> 01:13:00,364
"He's the one god
who has not begotten."

732
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:02,648
Say it!

733
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:06,365
No,Baba.

734
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:11,405
No!

Sorry for the delay
in posting my interview.

742
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:03,119
It's been a rough week.

743
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:22,273
New post.

744
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:27,088
I have cancer.

745
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:34,164
Amy is going to die.

746
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:54,246
No!

747
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:33,323
Jeffrey, I need
to talk to you.

748
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:35,005
You know how
I feel about that.

749
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:45,530
As if Dawkins thought--

750
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:49,270
Jeffrey, I'm leaving you.

751
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:54,199
Excuse me.

752
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:56,084
What?

753
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:58,442
What are you saying?

754
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:01,439
I'm leaving you.

755
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:03,233
You can't do that.

756
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:05,727
I won't accept it.

757
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:09,925
I'm sorry.

758
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:11,565
I
said I don't accept that.

759
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:14,673
I won't allow it.

760
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:23,030
I know, I heard you,
but it's not your choice.

761
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,371
Good bye, Jeffrey.

762
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:47,483
How long has she
been hiding her faith?

763
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:50,246
About a year.

764
01:17:56,800 --> 01:18:01,488
You asked to be
in the trenches, David.

765
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:26,846
What have I done,
Pastor Dave?

766
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:28,633
I've lost everything.

767
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:31,844
What if I made
a mistake?

768
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:42,645
By standing up
for your faith.

769
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:53,562
I don't think
I can do this.

770
01:18:53,760 --> 01:19:00,109
We're here for you,
Ayisha.

771
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:06,396
Are you--have
you read of the Apostle Paul?

772
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:08,967
He said, "I know
what it is to have little,

773
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:12,130
"and I know what it is
to have plenty.

774
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:14,880
"In any and all
circumstances,

775
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:18,964
"and of being hungry,

776
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:24,360
"of having plenty
and of being in need.

777
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:25,971
I can do all things--"

778
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:31,087
"Through Christ
who strengthens me."

779
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:35,109
Right.

780
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:42,122
You're gonna be okay.

781
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:35,520
and spew
your propaganda.

782
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:41,290
But today, we're gonna
change things up a bit.

783
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:51,599
Evil.

784
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:05,765
"If God is all-good
and God is all-powerful,

785
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:09,152
why does he allow
evil to exist?"

786
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:19,640
God allows evil to exist
because of free will.

787
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:24,193
On a temporary basis
so that one day,

788
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:26,488
those who choose
to love him freely

789
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:31,811
but with their
free will in tact.

790
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:38,873
Is to one day destroy it.

791
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:41,680
Well, how convenient.

792
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:54,729
Have a nice life."

793
01:21:57,840 --> 01:21:59,319
But why not?

794
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:04,131
Doesn't believe
in moral absolutes,

795
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:08,525
during finals week.

796
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:15,605
Insisting it's wrong
to cheat,

797
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:17,245
that I should have
known that.

798
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:25,317
Then why shouldn't
I perform them?

799
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:30,690
What constitutes
right and wrong,

800
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:40,287
that a moral atheist
is an impossibility.

801
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:44,605
I mean, there's
not even a standard

802
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:51,358
in my example, stealing
a grade I didn't earn--

803
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:52,971
are forbidden.

804
01:22:53,160 --> 01:22:54,605
It's a form of theft.

805
01:22:56,440 --> 01:22:58,875
As Dostoyevsky
famously pointed out,

806
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:16,473
all of our struggle,
our debate,

807
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:25,371
This is ridiculous.

808
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:27,011
So, after all your talk,

809
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:29,123
you're saying that it all
comes down to choice:

810
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:30,765
believe or don't believe.

811
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:33,566
That's right,
that's all there is.

812
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:35,171
That's all
there's ever been.

813
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:39,470
Is that you take away
their choice.

814
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:45,127
Yes,
because I want to free them.

815
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:46,845
Because religion
is like a--

816
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:52,810
down to their children,

817
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:54,963
and Christianity
is the worst virus of all.

818
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:56,571
It slowly creeps
into our lives

819
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:59,030
when we're weak
or sick or helpless.

820
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:00,685
So, religion
is like a disease?

821
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:03,281
Yes.
Yes, it infects everything.

822
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:06,845
Reason?

823
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:12,039
It's not even
atheism anymore.

824
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:14,197
What you're teaching
is antitheism.

825
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:16,033
It's not enough
that you don't believe.

826
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:19,915
You need all of us
to not believe with you.

827
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:21,804
Why
don't you admit the truth?

828
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:28,245
That's what God wants.

829
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:37,313
Me or God?

830
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:48,114
Do you hate God?

831
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:49,765
That's not even
a question.

832
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:52,930
Okay, why do you
hate God?

833
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:54,565
This is ridiculous.

834
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:57,195
Why do you hate God?
Answer the question.

835
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:00,525
Science supports
his existence.

836
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:02,916
You know the truth.

837
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,435
Why?!

838
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:09,472
It's a very simple
question, Professor.

839
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:12,206
Why do you hate God?

840
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:18,833
Yes, I hate God.

841
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:22,886
All I have for him
is hate.

842
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:45,565
You've proven nothing.

843
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:47,831
Maybe not.

844
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:53,851
They get to choose.

845
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:04,233
Is God dead?

846
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:29,790
God is not dead.

847
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:32,440
God's not dead.

848
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:33,994
God's not dead.
God's not dead.

849
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:35,247
God's not dead. God's not dead.
God's not dead.

850
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:36,362
God's not dead. God's not dead.
God's not dead.

851
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:21,290
Josh!

852
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:26,033
Josh.Josh!

853
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:31,043
Your decision to prove
God is not dead

854
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:35,645
I'm glad.

855
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:39,276
Yes, and it has
changed everything.

856
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:43,491
I've decided
to follow Jesus.

857
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:46,513
That's great, Martin.

858
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:48,165
Hey, you know what?

859
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:50,084
You've gotta
check this out.

860
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:52,311
- Okay.
- Come on.

861
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:55,607
Why did I
have to bring my suitcase?

862
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:11,970
Amen.

863
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:13,571
That's it?

864
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:21,131
No.

865
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:25,359
So then,
let's give it a try.

866
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:27,847
Okay-

867
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:29,485
No,no,no,no.

868
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:33,435
Put our bags
in the trunk first.

869
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:42,971
Now I'm asking you
to show faith.

870
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:48,398
Okay-

871
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:07,311
- Unbelievable.
- No. Faith.

872
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:14,438
- God is good.
- All the time.

873
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:19,191
- And all the time?
- God is good.

874
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:36,724
I don't even know
what I'm doing here.

875
01:29:58,160 --> 01:30:01,676
Your whole life,

876
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:10,090
and here you are.

877
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:23,394
You have dementia,
my life is perfect.

878
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:26,917
Explain that to me.

879
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:31,915
Sometimes the devil
allows people

880
01:30:32,120 --> 01:30:36,091
to live a life
free of trouble

881
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:58,765
The door's wide open

882
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:04,922
'til one day,
time runs out,

883
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:10,971
and the cell door
slams shut

884
01:31:11,160 --> 01:31:17,395
and suddenly...
it's too late.

885
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:40,211
I can't believe this.

886
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:41,925
The car actually starts

887
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:44,680
and now we're being
done-in by believers.

888
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:46,359
I think it's beautiful.

889
01:31:51,640 --> 01:31:54,109
Move!

890
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:08,528
Hello, gentlemen.

891
01:32:08,720 --> 01:32:10,165
Can I help you?

892
01:32:10,360 --> 01:32:11,771
I'm Amy Ryan.
I write "The New Left."

893
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,445
Michael Tait.
How are you?

894
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:15,085
Did we schedule this?

895
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:24,200
And you're gonna sing
about God and Jesus

896
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:26,596
as if they're as real
as you and me.

897
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:28,518
How can you do that?

898
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:31,451
Well, to us,
they are as real.

899
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:33,563
As a matter of fact,
even more so.

900
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:36,764
I mean, we exist
in the here and now.

901
01:32:51,080 --> 01:32:53,242
"Don't worry,
it's all in there."

902
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:01,324
and it's where
we draw our strength

903
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:04,649
and it's where
we find our hope.

904
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:07,844
So, where do you
find your hope?

905
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:19,680
I'm dying.

906
01:33:29,480 --> 01:33:31,073
I think that's what
you might have done,

907
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:34,409
but I think you're here
kinda wondering,

908
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:43,571
How do you know that?

909
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:45,791
I just felt
that that's what God was saying,

910
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:51,029
and he just wanted
you to know it.

911
01:33:51,240 --> 01:33:54,961
That's--I can't--

912
01:33:55,160 --> 01:33:58,596
Yeah, and
he's just the drummer.

913

Call an ambulance!

953
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:08,729
Call an ambulance!

954
01:40:09,880 --> 01:40:11,530
Don't move.

955
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:14,793
His ribs are crushed.

956
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:16,923
His lungs
are filling with blood.

957
01:40:17,120 --> 01:40:18,770
He doesn't have long.

958
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:20,405
Are you sure?

959
01:40:20,600 --> 01:40:22,011
Yeah.

960
01:40:22,240 --> 01:40:23,651
Don't move.

961
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:25,285
I can't die.

962
01:40:25,480 --> 01:40:28,006
I'm not ready.

963
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:33,249
Do you know Jesus?

964
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:36,649
I'm an atheist.

965
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:42,367
I'm dying.

966
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:44,005
How can you
call that mercy?

967
01:40:49,640 --> 01:40:51,631
But I'm here to tell you
that it's a gift

968
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:53,285
'cause the God
that you don't believe in

969
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:55,511
has given you
another chance,

970
01:40:59,160 --> 01:41:04,553
I don't want to die,
but I'm so scared.

971
01:41:04,760 --> 01:41:06,956
If it's any
consolation, so was Jesus.

972
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:10,682
He was so scared,
he sweat blood.

973
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:16,570
But the answer was no.

974
01:41:18,120 --> 01:41:21,010
He says no a lot.

975
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:27,080
If we knew
what he knows.

976
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:33,632
"So are my ways higher
than your ways,

977
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:40,644
Exactly.

978
01:41:40,840 --> 01:41:43,446
So, the question is--
stay with me.

979
01:41:43,640 --> 01:41:45,165
Stay with me.

980
01:41:48,240 --> 01:41:51,756
Are you willing
to take that chance?

981
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:56,801
Yes.

982
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:19,290
Do you accept him
as Lord and Savior?

983
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:25,209
Yes, I accept.

984
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:32,405
It's alright.

985
01:42:37,160 --> 01:42:41,165
It's okay, it's okay.

986
01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:11,608
If you check
out the screens behind me,

987
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:22,160
speaking on behalf
of the Robertson family.

988
01:43:22,360 --> 01:43:24,192
Me and the gang
wanted to let you know

989
01:43:41,960 --> 01:43:44,008
Now, let me
ask you a question.

990
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:46,396
Have you got your
cell phones on you?

991
01:43:46,600 --> 01:43:48,011
Good.

992
01:43:50,080 --> 01:43:52,367
I want everyone
to go to their contacts

993
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:54,324
and click on
everybody you know

994
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:58,127
and text them
three simple words:

995
01:43:58,320 --> 01:44:00,846
"God's not dead."

996
01:44:01,080 --> 01:44:03,606
And there's
10,000 of you out there,

997
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:07,049
and everyone knows
about 100 people.

998
01:44:13,120 --> 01:44:15,316
In the next 3 minutes.

999
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:34,758
It was you, wasn't it?

1000
01:44:38,280 --> 01:44:39,759
Yeah.

1001
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:41,411
How did you know?

1002
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:43,045
I heard you talking
