1
00:01:04,354 --> 00:01:08,270
<i>After I killed them,
I dropped the gun in the Thames,</i>

2
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:11,535
<i>washed the residue off me hands
in the bathroom of a Burger King,</i>

3
00:01:11,635 --> 00:01:14,246
<i>and walked home
to await instructions.</i>

4
00:01:15,287 --> 00:01:18,481
<i>Shortly thereafter,
the instructions came through.</i>

5
00:01:18,988 --> 00:01:22,302
<i>"Get the fuck out of London,
youse dumb fucks.</i>

6
00:01:22,402 --> 00:01:23,978
<i>"Get to Bruges"</i>

7
00:01:25,554 --> 00:01:28,452
<i>I didn't even know
where Bruges fucking was.</i>

8
00:01:32,487 --> 00:01:34,077
<i>It's in Belgium.</i>

9
00:01:37,787 --> 00:01:38,765
<i>Bruges is a shithole.</i>

10
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:40,202
<i>Bruges is
not a shithole.</i>

11
00:01:40,302 --> 00:01:41,299
<i>Bruges is a shithole.</i>

12
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:43,365
<i>Ray, we've only just
got off the fucking train.</i>

13
00:01:43,465 --> 00:01:46,336
<i>Could we reserve judgment on Bruges
until we've seen the fucking place?</i>

14
00:01:46,436 --> 00:01:47,977
<i>I know it's gonna be
a shithole.</i>

15
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,681
Shithole.

16
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,435
I think you have a couple of rooms
booked under Cranham and Blakely?

17
00:02:27,535 --> 00:02:30,714
Yes. No, we have one room booked.

18
00:02:31,354 --> 00:02:33,820
One twin room.
Booked for two weeks.

19
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:36,050
Two weeks!

20
00:02:36,721 --> 00:02:37,834
Do you have another room?

21
00:02:37,934 --> 00:02:39,466
No, I'm afraid we're fully booked.

22
00:02:39,566 --> 00:02:42,486
With Christmas,
everywhere is fully booked.

23
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,567
Okay.

24
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:51,503
It's very pretty.

25
00:02:51,603 --> 00:02:53,098
I'm not being funny,
we can't stay here.

26
00:02:53,198 --> 00:02:55,069
We've got to stay here
until he rings.

27
00:02:55,169 --> 00:02:56,502
Well, what if he doesn't
ring for two weeks?

28
00:02:56,602 --> 00:02:58,200
Then we stay here for two weeks.

29
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,630
For two weeks? In fucking Bruges?

30
00:03:00,646 --> 00:03:02,083
In a room like this?

31
00:03:02,168 --> 00:03:03,779
With you? No way!

32
00:03:03,887 --> 00:03:06,567
Ray, I really don't like to say this.

33
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:09,002
You really don't like to say what?

34
00:03:09,102 --> 00:03:10,815
Well. You know?

35
00:03:13,354 --> 00:03:15,217
Fucking bring that up.

36
00:03:51,621 --> 00:03:53,869
Do you think this is good?

37
00:03:53,968 --> 00:03:55,965
Do I think what's good?

38
00:03:56,065 --> 00:03:59,247
You know, going round in a boat,
looking at stuff.

39
00:03:59,953 --> 00:04:01,817
Yes, I do.

40
00:04:03,387 --> 00:04:05,410
It's called "sightseeing."

41
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,846
Oh, look at that.

42
00:04:20,253 --> 00:04:22,239
It's a former hospital.

43
00:04:22,455 --> 00:04:23,922
From the 1100s.

44
00:04:26,621 --> 00:04:29,070
Bruges is the most
well-preserved medieval town

45
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,551
in the whole of Belgium, apparently.

46
00:04:53,487 --> 00:04:54,819
Coming up?

47
00:04:55,034 --> 00:04:56,431
What's up there?

48
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,534
The view.

49
00:04:58,634 --> 00:04:59,568
The view of what?

50
00:04:59,584 --> 00:05:02,444
The view of down here?
I can see that from down here.

51
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:06,769
Ray, you're about
the worst tourist in the whole world.

52
00:05:06,868 --> 00:05:10,236
Ken, I grew up in Dublin.
I love Dublin.

53
00:05:10,336 --> 00:05:12,884
If I'd grown up on a
farm and was retarded,

54
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:13,981
Bruges might impress me.

55
00:05:14,066 --> 00:05:16,278
But I didn't, so it doesn't.

56
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:30,899
Trying to get rid of me coins.

57
00:05:30,999 --> 00:05:34,032
3, 3.50, 4,

58
00:05:34,132 --> 00:05:39,599
4.10, 4.20, 4.30,
4.40, 4.50, 4.60,

59
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:41,901
4.70,

60
00:05:42,001 --> 00:05:43,510
4.80,

61
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,716
4.90.

62
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,234
Will you take 4.90?

63
00:05:51,334 --> 00:05:53,218
Entry is 5 euro.

64
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,868
Come on, man,
it's only 10 cents.

65
00:05:56,968 --> 00:05:58,317
Entry is 5 euro.

66
00:06:09,721 --> 00:06:11,069
Happy in your work?

67
00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:12,176
Very happy.

68
00:06:48,454 --> 00:06:49,976
I like it here.

69
00:07:17,786 --> 00:07:20,236
Been to the top of the tower?

70
00:07:20,336 --> 00:07:23,797
Yeah. Yeah, it's rubbish.

71
00:07:23,897 --> 00:07:26,943
It is? The guidebook says
it's a "must-see".

72
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,498
Well, you lot ain't going up there.

73
00:07:30,598 --> 00:07:32,165
Pardon me? Why?

74
00:07:32,265 --> 00:07:36,169
I mean, it's all windy stairs.
I'm not being funny.

75
00:07:36,269 --> 00:07:38,741
What exactly are you
trying to say?

76
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,466
What exactly
am I trying to say?

77
00:07:41,566 --> 00:07:43,936
Youse are a bunch
of fucking elephants!

78
00:07:44,036 --> 00:07:45,509
Right, you.

79
00:07:52,786 --> 00:07:54,775
Come on, leave it, fatty.

80
00:08:04,354 --> 00:08:07,717
You know, you're just
the rudest man. The rudest man!

81
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,283
What's all that about?

82
00:08:12,354 --> 00:08:13,668
They're not going up there.

83
00:08:13,768 --> 00:08:17,170
Hey, guys, I wouldn't go up there.
It's really narrow.

84
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,276
Screw you, motherfucker!

85
00:08:22,621 --> 00:08:24,450
Americans, isn't it?

86
00:08:29,153 --> 00:08:32,368
Now, this is more like it.
Proper holidays.

87
00:08:32,468 --> 00:08:33,965
One gay beer
for my gay friend,

88
00:08:34,065 --> 00:08:36,699
and one normal beer for me,
because I am normal.

89
00:08:37,886 --> 00:08:39,303
This is the life.

90
00:08:39,403 --> 00:08:41,978
We're not staying here getting pissed.

91
00:08:42,387 --> 00:08:44,235
We are quietly sightseeing,
like he says,

92
00:08:44,335 --> 00:08:46,966
and awaiting his call
to see what we do next.

93
00:08:47,066 --> 00:08:48,969
This is my vote
on what we should do.

94
00:08:49,069 --> 00:08:51,644
We give it another day,
two days, max.

95
00:08:52,187 --> 00:08:54,536
Then we check the papers again,
and if there's still nothing in them,

96
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:57,868
we phone him and say, "Harry,
thank you for the trip to Bruges,

97
00:08:57,968 --> 00:09:00,370
"it's been very nice, all the
old buildings and that,

98
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:03,167
"but we're coming back to London now,
and hide out in a proper country,

99
00:09:03,267 --> 00:09:05,501
"where it isn't all just
fucking chocolates."

100
00:09:05,601 --> 00:09:09,075
My vote would be
we quietly sightsee, like he says,

101
00:09:09,753 --> 00:09:12,584
and await his call
to see what we do next.

102
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:18,348
You don't even know
we're here hiding out.

103
00:09:20,053 --> 00:09:21,503
What are you talking about?

104
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,868
You don't even know
we're not here on a job.

105
00:09:23,968 --> 00:09:25,965
- What, on a job?
- Yeah.

106
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,565
- Here in Bruges?
- Yeah.

107
00:09:27,664 --> 00:09:30,051
- Here in Bruges, on a job?
- Yeah.

108
00:09:30,786 --> 00:09:32,467
Why? What did he actually say?

109
00:09:32,567 --> 00:09:33,969
He didn't actually say anything.

110
00:09:34,069 --> 00:09:36,936
- Then why do you think it might be?
- I don't think anything.

111
00:09:37,036 --> 00:09:39,970
But it's a bit fucking
over-elaborate, isn't it?

112
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,598
- "Go take him to hide out."
- "Go take him to hide out where?"

113
00:09:42,664 --> 00:09:45,552
"Go take him to hide out
in fucking Bruges."

114
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:49,112
You can hide out in Croydon.

115
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,018
Or Coventry.

116
00:09:59,586 --> 00:10:01,677
It is a bit over-elaborate.

117
00:10:06,053 --> 00:10:07,402
But we haven't got any guns.

118
00:10:07,502 --> 00:10:09,782
Harry can get guns anywhere.

119
00:10:32,053 --> 00:10:34,178
He's not gonna ring tonight.

120
00:10:40,886 --> 00:10:42,977
He's not gonna ring tonight.

121
00:10:44,553 --> 00:10:46,065
Let's go out.

122
00:10:46,165 --> 00:10:48,069
- Go out where?
- The pub.

123
00:10:48,169 --> 00:10:49,176
No!

124
00:11:07,586 --> 00:11:09,669
Let's go out and have a look
at some of the...

125
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,300
All the old medieval
buildings and that.

126
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,844
Because I bet they look even
better at night, all lit up.

127
00:11:20,354 --> 00:11:21,411
Yes!

128
00:11:30,886 --> 00:11:33,864
That there is called
the Gruuthuse Museum.

129
00:11:33,964 --> 00:11:35,999
They all have funny names,
don't they?

130
00:11:36,099 --> 00:11:37,575
Yes, Flemish.

131
00:11:38,753 --> 00:11:41,668
In here it says, "The Belgians
twice sheltered fugitive English Kings

132
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:44,636
"from being murdered, 1471 and 1651."

133
00:11:44,636 --> 00:11:46,935
I used to hate history,
didn't you?

134
00:11:47,035 --> 00:11:49,403
It's all just a load of stuff
that's already happened.

135
00:11:49,502 --> 00:11:51,403
What are they doing over there?

136
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:54,112
They're filming something.
They're filming midgets!

137
00:11:55,653 --> 00:11:56,778
Ray!

138
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:03,977
So, on this scene, you're supposed
to walk like a little, tiny mouse, yeah?

139
00:12:07,287 --> 00:12:09,253
Okay? Great.

140
00:12:12,453 --> 00:12:13,802
Ray, come on, let's go.

141
00:12:13,902 --> 00:12:16,716
My arse, "Let's go."
They're filming midgets.

142
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,334
Oh, my God!
Look at that girl.

143
00:12:21,433 --> 00:12:22,931
She's gorgeous!

144
00:12:23,031 --> 00:12:24,200
Ray, we're going right now.

145
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,764
Fuck off, are we!

146
00:12:25,864 --> 00:12:28,129
This is the best bit of Bruges so far.

147
00:12:28,245 --> 00:12:29,698
You and your buildings.

148
00:12:54,187 --> 00:12:55,346
Hello.

149
00:12:58,053 --> 00:13:00,022
Do you speak English?

150
00:13:00,038 --> 00:13:00,693
No.

151
00:13:01,987 --> 00:13:03,210
Yes, you do.

152
00:13:03,326 --> 00:13:04,615
Everybody does.

153
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,399
What are you filming midgets for?

154
00:13:07,499 --> 00:13:10,850
It's a Dutch movie.
It's a dream sequence.

155
00:13:11,886 --> 00:13:14,269
It's a pastiche of Nicholas Roeg's
<i>Don't Look Now.</i>

156
00:13:14,368 --> 00:13:16,320
Not a pastiche, but a...

157
00:13:17,386 --> 00:13:20,910
A "homage" is too strong.
A "nod of the head"?

158
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,615
Wow, your English is very good.

159
00:13:30,253 --> 00:13:32,980
A lot of midgets
tend to kill themselves.

160
00:13:35,486 --> 00:13:38,048
A disproportionate amount.

161
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,309
Hervé Villechaize,
off of <i>Fantasy Island</i>.

162
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:45,401
I think somebody
off <i>The Time Bandits.</i>

163
00:13:45,501 --> 00:13:48,748
I suppose they must
get really sad about, like,

164
00:13:50,087 --> 00:13:51,834
being really little and that.

165
00:13:51,934 --> 00:13:54,499
People looking at them
and laughing at them.

166
00:13:54,599 --> 00:13:57,848
Calling them names.
You know, 'shortarse.'

167
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:03,575
There's another famous midget I'm missing,
but I can't remember.

168
00:14:04,753 --> 00:14:06,151
It's not the R2-D2 man.

169
00:14:06,167 --> 00:14:07,763
No, he's still going.

170
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,876
I hope your midget doesn't kill himself.
Your dream sequence will be fucked.

171
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:16,831
He doesn't like being called a midget.
He prefers "dwarf."

172
00:14:16,931 --> 00:14:19,103
Well, this is exactly my point!

173
00:14:19,302 --> 00:14:22,414
People go around calling you a midget
when you want to be called a dwarf.

174
00:14:22,499 --> 00:14:24,917
Of course you're gonna
blow your head off!

175
00:14:27,087 --> 00:14:30,180
- My name's Ray. What's yours?
- Chloe.

176
00:14:32,253 --> 00:14:33,933
How did you get past
the security man?

177
00:14:34,033 --> 00:14:37,334
Getting past security men,
it's sort of my job.

178
00:14:37,434 --> 00:14:38,369
You're a shoplifter?

179
00:14:38,469 --> 00:14:40,498
No, not a shoplifter.

180
00:14:40,598 --> 00:14:42,552
It's a good joke, though.

181
00:14:43,553 --> 00:14:44,678
No.

182
00:14:45,453 --> 00:14:48,235
I'll tell you what I am
at dinner tomorrow night.

183
00:15:04,453 --> 00:15:05,612
Fuck.

184
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,415
How fucking cool.

185
00:15:31,486 --> 00:15:33,267
Mr. Blakely?

186
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:34,944
Yes. No, Mr. Cranham.

187
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,261
No. Yes. Mr. Blakely. Yes.

188
00:15:39,953 --> 00:15:41,816
You have a message.

189
00:15:47,087 --> 00:15:48,178
Shit!

190
00:15:49,053 --> 00:15:52,233
<i>Number one, why aren't you
in when I fucking told you to be in?</i>

191
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:55,432
<i>Number two, why doesn't this hotel
have phones with fucking voicemail</i>

192
00:15:55,532 --> 00:15:58,267
<i>and not I have to leave messages
with the fucking receptionist?</i>

193
00:15:58,367 --> 00:16:01,235
<i>Number three, you better fucking be in
tomorrow night when I fucking call again</i>

194
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:05,445
<i>or there'll be fucking Hell to pay,
I'm fucking telling you, Harry.</i>

195
00:16:42,686 --> 00:16:45,136
Would you turn
the fucking light off!

196
00:16:45,235 --> 00:16:46,731
Sorry, Ken.

197
00:16:46,831 --> 00:16:48,945
Keep the fucking noise down!

198
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,881
Someone's in a mood.

199
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,398
You'll never guess what.

200
00:17:09,498 --> 00:17:11,565
Will you shut your fucking mouth,
please, and go to sleep?

201
00:17:11,665 --> 00:17:13,312
Oh, sorry.

202
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:20,809
Except I've gotta take me
contact lenses out.

203
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,369
Altogether,

204
00:17:29,469 --> 00:17:30,919
I had

205
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:35,150
five pints of beer
and six bottles.

206
00:17:36,686 --> 00:17:40,934
No. Six pints of beer
and seven bottles.

207
00:17:41,034 --> 00:17:43,645
And you know what?
I'm not even pissed!

208
00:17:49,553 --> 00:17:51,746
You'll never guess what, Ken.

209
00:17:53,419 --> 00:17:55,532
- Ken, you'll never guess what.
- What?

210
00:17:55,632 --> 00:17:56,833
Got a date for tomorrow night.

211
00:17:56,933 --> 00:17:57,999
I'm very happy for you.

212
00:17:58,098 --> 00:17:59,199
With a girl.

213
00:17:59,299 --> 00:18:00,447
Can you turn
the light off, please?

214
00:18:00,553 --> 00:18:01,769
Only been in Bruges one day,

215
00:18:01,785 --> 00:18:03,817
got a date with a girl
in the film business,

216
00:18:03,902 --> 00:18:05,943
the Belgian film business.

217
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,342
They're doing a film about a midget.

218
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,811
Miss?

219
00:18:29,653 --> 00:18:30,812
Marie?

220
00:18:34,086 --> 00:18:36,155
Sorry about the
message last night.

221
00:18:36,271 --> 00:18:38,500
The man who left it
is a bit of a...

222
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:41,942
Well, he's a bit of a...

223
00:18:42,553 --> 00:18:43,644
Cock?

224
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,843
Yes. He's a bit of a cock.

225
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:51,346
Morning.

226
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,609
Harry called last night.

227
00:19:03,252 --> 00:19:04,775
We missed him.

228
00:19:07,586 --> 00:19:10,051
Jeez, he swears a lot, doesn't he?

229
00:19:11,252 --> 00:19:13,089
We're staying in tonight.

230
00:19:13,305 --> 00:19:14,524
Whatever happens.

231
00:19:17,453 --> 00:19:18,783
Except...

232
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,398
Except 'hmm' what?

233
00:19:24,498 --> 00:19:29,234
Except only one of us
needs to stay in, really.

234
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:34,766
And which one of us
would that be, now, Ray?

235
00:19:34,866 --> 00:19:36,269
I thought you didn't like Bruges.

236
00:19:36,369 --> 00:19:38,134
I don't like Bruges,
it's a shithole.

237
00:19:38,234 --> 00:19:42,001
But I did already say I had a date
with a Belgian lady

238
00:19:42,101 --> 00:19:46,143
in the Belgian film business,
which I did already say about before.

239
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:53,333
Just don't get into
any fucking trouble.

240
00:19:53,433 --> 00:19:55,544
We're keeping a low profile.

241
00:19:56,152 --> 00:19:59,867
And this morning,
and this afternoon,

242
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:02,301
we are doing what I want to do.

243
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:04,147
- Got it?
- Of course.

244
00:20:05,019 --> 00:20:06,903
Which, I presume,
will involve culture.

245
00:20:07,002 --> 00:20:10,700
Oh, we shall strike a balance
between culture and fun.

246
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:15,343
Somehow I believe, Ken, that the
balance shall tip in the favor of culture.

247
00:20:16,353 --> 00:20:20,202
Like a big, fat, fucking retarded,
fucking black girl

248
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,979
on a seesaw, opposite

249
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,980
a dwarf.

250
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:06,599
Ray, did we
or did we not agree

251
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:08,443
that if I let you go
on your date tonight,

252
00:21:08,459 --> 00:21:10,217
we'd do the things
I wanted to do today?

253
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:12,334
We are doing the things
that you wanted to do today.

254
00:21:12,334 --> 00:21:14,865
And that we'd do them without you
throwing a fucking moody,

255
00:21:14,964 --> 00:21:17,301
like some 5-year-old who's dropped
all his sweets.

256
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,352
I didn't agree to that.

257
00:21:20,052 --> 00:21:22,211
I'll cheer up.
I'll cheer up.

258
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:25,586
Up there, the top altar, is a phial

259
00:21:26,353 --> 00:21:29,831
brought back by a Flemish knight
from the Crusades in the Holy Land.

260
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:32,499
And that phial, do you know
what it's said to contain?

261
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:34,131
No, what's it said to contain?

262
00:21:34,231 --> 00:21:38,163
It's said to contain some drops of
Jesus Christ's blood.

263
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:40,538
Yeah, that's how
this church got its name.

264
00:21:40,554 --> 00:21:42,081
Basilica of the Holy Blood.

265
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:43,401
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

266
00:21:43,501 --> 00:21:46,350
And this blood, right,
though it's dried blood,

267
00:21:46,453 --> 00:21:50,498
at different times over many years,
they say it turned back into liquid.

268
00:21:50,598 --> 00:21:53,232
Turned back into liquid
from dried blood.

269
00:21:53,332 --> 00:21:55,444
At various times of great

270
00:21:57,052 --> 00:21:58,266
stress.

271
00:21:58,366 --> 00:21:59,635
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

272
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:04,799
So, yeah, I'm gonna go up in the queue
and touch it, which is what you do.

273
00:22:04,898 --> 00:22:07,044
- Yeah?
- Yeah. You coming?

274
00:22:08,086 --> 00:22:09,575
Do I have to?

275
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:14,035
- Do you have to?
- Of course you don't have to.

276
00:22:14,135 --> 00:22:15,952
It's Jesus' fucking blood, isn't it?

277
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,785
Of course you don't fucking have to!

278
00:22:18,068 --> 00:22:20,575
Of course you don't fucking have to!

279
00:23:04,453 --> 00:23:06,442
You little fucking cunt.

280
00:23:39,286 --> 00:23:41,343
<i>Murder, Father.</i>

281
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,647
<i>Why did you murder someone, Raymond?</i>

282
00:23:46,586 --> 00:23:48,643
For money, Father.

283
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:50,416
For money?

284
00:23:51,553 --> 00:23:53,435
You murdered someone for money?

285
00:23:53,535 --> 00:23:54,507
Yes, Father.

286
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,940
Not out of anger,
not out of nothing.

287
00:23:57,056 --> 00:23:57,862
For money.

288
00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:03,110
Who did you murder
for money, Raymond?

289
00:24:03,885 --> 00:24:05,283
You, Father.

290
00:24:07,353 --> 00:24:08,499
I'm sorry?

291
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:11,279
I said you, Father.
What, are you deaf?

292
00:24:11,719 --> 00:24:13,686
Harry Waters says hello.

293
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,549
The little boy.

294
00:26:19,086 --> 00:26:21,131
I quite like this one.

295
00:26:21,231 --> 00:26:25,467
All the rest were rubbish by spastics,
but this one's quite good.

296
00:26:25,566 --> 00:26:27,575
What's that all about, then?

297
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:32,578
- It's Judgment Day, you know?
- Oh, yeah.

298
00:26:35,619 --> 00:26:38,097
What's that then?

299
00:26:38,197 --> 00:26:41,277
Well, it's, you know,
the final day on Earth.

300
00:26:42,019 --> 00:26:47,042
When mankind will be judged for all
the crimes they've committed and that.

301
00:26:48,619 --> 00:26:52,036
And see who gets into Heaven
and who gets into Hell and all that?

302
00:26:52,136 --> 00:26:53,164
Yeah.

303
00:26:53,264 --> 00:26:55,033
And what's the other place?

304
00:26:55,133 --> 00:26:56,333
Purgatory.

305
00:26:56,433 --> 00:26:58,666
Purgatory?

306
00:26:58,766 --> 00:27:01,831
Purgatory's kind of like
the in-betweeny one.

307
00:27:01,931 --> 00:27:03,400
You weren't really shit,

308
00:27:03,416 --> 00:27:06,023
but you weren't all that great, either.

309
00:27:06,552 --> 00:27:08,075
Like Tottenham.

310
00:27:09,019 --> 00:27:11,469
Do you believe
in all that stuff, Ken?

311
00:27:11,568 --> 00:27:13,030
About Tottenham?

312
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:15,483
The Last Judgment
and the afterlife.

313
00:27:18,453 --> 00:27:21,442
Guilt and sins and

314
00:27:22,952 --> 00:27:25,713
Hell and all that?

315
00:27:28,386 --> 00:27:29,374
Um...

316
00:27:32,785 --> 00:27:33,773
Well...

317
00:27:40,386 --> 00:27:41,632
I don't know, Ray.

318
00:27:41,848 --> 00:27:43,658
I don't know what I believe.

319
00:27:43,819 --> 00:27:47,264
The things you're taught as a child,
they never really leave you, do they?

320
00:27:47,364 --> 00:27:49,900
So, like, I believe in trying
to lead a good life.

321
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,531
Like, if there's an old lady,
carrying her shopping home,

322
00:27:53,631 --> 00:27:55,955
I don't try and help her
carry her shopping,

323
00:27:55,971 --> 00:27:57,348
I don't go that far,

324
00:27:57,433 --> 00:27:59,746
but I'll certainly hold the
door open for her and that,

325
00:27:59,862 --> 00:28:01,415
and let her go out before me.

326
00:28:01,499 --> 00:28:03,698
Yeah. And anyway, if you tried to
help her carry her shopping,

327
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:05,826
she'd probably think you were
just trying to nick her shopping.

328
00:28:05,916 --> 00:28:08,515
- Exactly.
- This is the world we live in today.

329
00:28:08,607 --> 00:28:11,922
At the same time as
trying to lead a good life,

330
00:28:13,286 --> 00:28:15,873
I have to reconcile myself
with the fact that, yes,

331
00:28:16,089 --> 00:28:17,630
I have killed people.

332
00:28:18,585 --> 00:28:19,774
Not many people.

333
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:22,424
Most of them were not
very nice people.

334
00:28:22,652 --> 00:28:24,798
Apart from one person.

335
00:28:24,898 --> 00:28:26,268
Who's that?

336
00:28:26,368 --> 00:28:28,768
This fellow,
Danny Aliband's brother.

337
00:28:28,868 --> 00:28:30,972
He was just trying to
protect his brother.

338
00:28:31,088 --> 00:28:32,312
Like you or I would.

339
00:28:32,397 --> 00:28:34,667
He was just a lollipop man.

340
00:28:34,767 --> 00:28:38,197
He came at me with a bottle.
What are you gonna do?

341
00:28:38,297 --> 00:28:39,668
I shot him down.

342
00:28:41,452 --> 00:28:45,234
In my book, though, sorry,
someone comes at you with a bottle,

343
00:28:45,334 --> 00:28:47,864
that is a deadly weapon,
he's gotta take the consequences.

344
00:28:47,964 --> 00:28:49,335
I know that in my heart.

345
00:28:49,434 --> 00:28:51,700
I also know that he was just trying
to protect his brother, you know?

346
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,134
I know. But a bottle,
that can kill you.

347
00:28:54,234 --> 00:28:55,457
It's a case of
it's you or him.

348
00:28:55,498 --> 00:28:57,369
If he'd come at you with his
bare hands, that'd be different.

349
00:28:57,468 --> 00:28:58,564
That wouldn't
have been fair.

350
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:00,927
Well, technically, your bare hands
can kill somebody, too.

351
00:29:01,001 --> 00:29:03,774
They can be deadly weapons, too.
I mean, what if he knew karate, say?

352
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:05,091
You said he was
a lollipop man.

353
00:29:05,166 --> 00:29:06,967
He was a lollipop man.

354
00:29:07,067 --> 00:29:09,300
What's a lollipop man doing
knowing fucking karate?

355
00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:10,397
I'm just saying.

356
00:29:10,497 --> 00:29:13,031
- How old was he?
- About 50.

357
00:29:13,131 --> 00:29:15,535
What's a 50-year-old lollipop man
doing knowing fucking karate?

358
00:29:15,635 --> 00:29:17,968
What was he,
a Chinese lollipop man?

359
00:29:18,068 --> 00:29:21,143
Jesus, Ken, I'm trying to
talk about...

360
00:29:29,552 --> 00:29:31,434
I know what you're
trying to talk about.

361
00:29:31,534 --> 00:29:34,800
I killed a little boy.
You keep bringing up fucking lollipop men!

362
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,633
You didn't mean
to kill a little boy.

363
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,685
I know I didn't mean to.

364
00:29:40,719 --> 00:29:44,231
But because of the choices I made and
the course that I put into action,

365
00:29:44,331 --> 00:29:46,566
a little boy
isn't here anymore.

366
00:29:46,666 --> 00:29:48,880
And he'll never be here again.

367
00:29:53,485 --> 00:29:56,474
I mean here in the world,
not here in Belgium.

368
00:29:58,119 --> 00:29:59,932
Well, he'll never be here in Belgium,
either, will he?

369
00:30:00,032 --> 00:30:03,101
I mean, he might have wanted
to come here when he got older.

370
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:04,811
I don't know why.

371
00:30:06,385 --> 00:30:08,578
And that's all because of me.

372
00:30:10,652 --> 00:30:12,765
He's dead because of me.

373
00:30:12,865 --> 00:30:14,284
And I'm trying to...

374
00:30:15,019 --> 00:30:18,213
I'm trying to get me head
around it, but I can't.

375
00:30:19,385 --> 00:30:22,181
I will always have
killed that little boy.

376
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:26,550
That ain't ever
going away. Ever.

377
00:30:27,986 --> 00:30:29,247
Unless...

378
00:30:30,619 --> 00:30:32,210
Maybe I go away.

379
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:39,210
Don't even think like that.

380
00:31:34,752 --> 00:31:36,241
You look good.

381
00:31:40,619 --> 00:31:42,585
What's it matter anyway?

382
00:32:07,885 --> 00:32:09,430
So, what do you do, Raymond?

383
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:11,126
I...

384
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:12,940
shoot people for money.

385
00:32:15,285 --> 00:32:17,000
What kinds of people?

386
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:20,367
Priests. Children.
You know, the usual.

387
00:32:20,467 --> 00:32:22,664
Is there a lot of money to be made
in that line of business?

388
00:32:22,764 --> 00:32:24,589
There is in priests.
There isn't in children.

389
00:32:24,664 --> 00:32:25,900
So what is it you do, Chloe?

390
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,077
I sell cocaine and heroin
to Belgian film crews.

391
00:32:29,552 --> 00:32:30,745
Do you?

392
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:35,081
Do I look like I do?

393
00:32:36,652 --> 00:32:38,230
You do, actually.

394
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:44,150
Do I look like I shoot people?

395
00:32:45,418 --> 00:32:46,441
No.

396
00:32:48,352 --> 00:32:49,841
Just children.

397
00:32:57,418 --> 00:32:58,936
I saw your midget today.

398
00:32:58,962 --> 00:33:00,892
Little prick didn't even say hello.

399
00:33:00,967 --> 00:33:02,900
Well, he's on a lot of ketamine.

400
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,416
What's that?

401
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,301
Horse tranquilizer.

402
00:33:07,401 --> 00:33:08,964
A horse tranquilizer?

403
00:33:09,064 --> 00:33:10,297
Where'd he get that?

404
00:33:10,423 --> 00:33:11,526
I sold it to him.

405
00:33:11,601 --> 00:33:14,676
You can't sell horse tranquilizers
to a midget!

406
00:33:17,885 --> 00:33:20,200
This movie, I think it's gonna be
a very good one.

407
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,707
There's never been a classic movie
made in Bruges until now.

408
00:33:22,768 --> 00:33:24,365
Of course there hasn't,
it's a shithole.

409
00:33:24,465 --> 00:33:25,899
Bruges is my hometown, Ray.

410
00:33:25,999 --> 00:33:27,164
Well, it's still a shithole.

411
00:33:27,264 --> 00:33:28,263
It's not a shithole.

412
00:33:28,363 --> 00:33:30,763
What? Even midgets have to
take drugs to stick it.

413
00:33:30,863 --> 00:33:32,113
Okay.

414
00:33:33,552 --> 00:33:37,665
So, you've insulted my hometown.

415
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:40,134
You're doing very well, Raymond.

416
00:33:40,234 --> 00:33:42,641
Why don't you tell me some
Belgian jokes while you're at it?

417
00:33:42,735 --> 00:33:44,297
I don't know any Belgian jokes.

418
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:47,667
And if I did, I think I'd have
the good sense not to...

419
00:33:47,767 --> 00:33:52,230
Hey, hang on. Is Belgium where there
were all those child abuse murders lately?

420
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,546
Then I do know a Belgian joke.

421
00:33:56,919 --> 00:33:58,942
What's Belgium famous for?

422
00:33:59,385 --> 00:34:00,801
Chocolates and child abuse.

423
00:34:00,901 --> 00:34:04,476
And they only invented the chocolates
to get to the kids.

424
00:34:05,619 --> 00:34:06,846
What?

425
00:34:07,452 --> 00:34:10,748
One of the girls they murdered was
a friend of mine.

426
00:34:20,485 --> 00:34:22,144
I'm sorry, Chloe.

427
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:34,697
One of the girls they murdered
wasn't a friend of mine.

428
00:34:34,797 --> 00:34:37,499
I just wanted to
make you feel bad.

429
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,915
And it worked.
Quite well.

430
00:34:59,518 --> 00:35:01,313
Fucking unbelievable.

431
00:35:14,585 --> 00:35:16,332
What's fucking unbelievable?

432
00:35:16,432 --> 00:35:18,281
Are you talking to me?

433
00:35:19,885 --> 00:35:23,065
He pauses, even though he
should just hit the cunt.

434
00:35:23,165 --> 00:35:24,500
And he repeats.

435
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:28,968
Yes, I am talking to you.
What's fucking unbelievable?

436
00:35:29,067 --> 00:35:31,367
Well, I'll tell you what's
fucking unbelievable, shall I?

437
00:35:31,467 --> 00:35:34,198
Blowing cigarette smoke straight
into myself and my girlfriend's face.

438
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:35,399
That's fucking unbelievable!

439
00:35:35,499 --> 00:35:38,632
- This is the smoking section.
- I don't care if it's the smoking section.

440
00:35:38,732 --> 00:35:41,067
All right?
She directed it right in my face, man.

441
00:35:41,167 --> 00:35:44,067
I don't wanna die just because of
your fucking arrogance.

442
00:35:44,167 --> 00:35:47,101
Isn't that what the
Vietnamese used to say?

443
00:35:47,201 --> 00:35:50,366
Vietnamese? What are you
talking about, the Vietnamese?

444
00:35:50,466 --> 00:35:52,165
That statement makes
no fucking sense at all.

445
00:35:52,265 --> 00:35:54,100
- Yes it does.
- The Vietnamese!

446
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,832
Well, saying it over and over ain't
gonna make any more sense out of it.

447
00:35:56,932 --> 00:35:59,768
How does the Vietnamese
have any relevance whatsoever

448
00:35:59,868 --> 00:36:02,363
to myself and my girlfriend
having to breathe

449
00:36:02,463 --> 00:36:04,098
your friend's cigarette smoke?

450
00:36:04,198 --> 00:36:06,242
Tell me how saying...

451
00:36:06,819 --> 00:36:09,910
That's for John Lennon,
you Yankee fucking cunt!

452
00:36:10,385 --> 00:36:12,681
A bottle? No, don't bother.

453
00:36:26,985 --> 00:36:28,178
We're leaving.

454
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:31,648
I don't hit women!
I would never hit a woman, Chloe!

455
00:36:32,585 --> 00:36:34,597
I'd hit a woman who was trying to
hit me with a bottle!

456
00:36:34,697 --> 00:36:37,399
That's different.
That's self-defense, isn't it?

457
00:36:37,499 --> 00:36:39,868
Or a woman who could do karate.

458
00:36:39,967 --> 00:36:43,632
I'd never hit a woman generally, Chloe.
Don't think that.

459
00:36:43,732 --> 00:36:45,446
God, you're pretty.

460
00:36:47,418 --> 00:36:48,868
I have to make a call.

461
00:36:48,967 --> 00:36:49,974
Oh, no.

462
00:36:50,619 --> 00:36:55,142
You've gone off me, now, haven't you?
Just because I hit that fucking cow.

463
00:37:19,685 --> 00:37:22,515
- Hello?
- <i>Where the fuck were you yesterday?</i>

464
00:37:23,018 --> 00:37:24,728
We just popped out
for some dinner, Harry.

465
00:37:24,854 --> 00:37:26,324
We only popped out
for half an hour.

466
00:37:26,399 --> 00:37:27,763
<i>Yeah? What'd you have?</i>

467
00:37:27,863 --> 00:37:29,633
- For dinner?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

468
00:37:29,733 --> 00:37:30,865
Pizza, at Pizza Hut.

469
00:37:30,964 --> 00:37:31,997
<i>Was it nice?</i>

470
00:37:32,097 --> 00:37:34,467
Yeah, it was all right.
I don't know. It was Pizza Hut.

471
00:37:34,567 --> 00:37:35,530
The same as in England.

472
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:38,044
<i>Well, that's globalization,
isn't it?</i>

473
00:37:38,072 --> 00:37:39,773
<i>Is Ray there with you?</i>

474
00:37:40,051 --> 00:37:41,967
He's in the toilet.

475
00:37:42,067 --> 00:37:44,231
<i>- Can he hear?</i>
- No.

476
00:37:44,331 --> 00:37:45,998
<i>What's he doing?</i>

477
00:37:46,098 --> 00:37:49,232
- What do you mean?
<i>- Is he doing a wee or a poo?</i>

478
00:37:49,332 --> 00:37:50,931
I don't know, Harry,
the door's closed.

479
00:37:51,031 --> 00:37:55,246
<i>Send him out on an errand for half
an hour, but don't make it sound suspicious.</i>

480
00:38:00,285 --> 00:38:03,910
Ray? Why don't you go out down
to the pub for half an hour?

481
00:38:06,585 --> 00:38:09,400
Yeah, yeah, I know I said you couldn't,

482
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,212
but might as well enjoy ourselves, eh?

483
00:38:12,251 --> 00:38:16,445
No, I don't know if they've got
bowling anywhere. Could have a look.

484
00:38:17,585 --> 00:38:19,073
Yeah, see you.

485
00:38:30,218 --> 00:38:31,432
Yeah. He's gone.

486
00:38:31,532 --> 00:38:33,766
<i>What'd you say to him?</i>

487
00:38:33,865 --> 00:38:36,368
I said, "Why don't you go have a drink,
you say you've been cooped up?"

488
00:38:36,468 --> 00:38:38,497
<i>- What did he say?</i>
- Said, yeah, he would.

489
00:38:38,597 --> 00:38:41,196
And he might go have a look to see
if there's a bowling alley around.

490
00:38:41,296 --> 00:38:42,698
<i>Was he just having a wee?</i>

491
00:38:42,798 --> 00:38:44,600
Yeah, I think so.
I assume so.

492
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,731
<i>Sure he didn't mind?</i>

493
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:47,364
No, he was glad to get out.

494
00:38:47,464 --> 00:38:48,565
<i>He's definitely gone?</i>

495
00:38:48,665 --> 00:38:50,067
Yeah, yeah, he slammed the door.

496
00:38:50,167 --> 00:38:53,413
<i>That don't mean he's gone.
Go check outside the door.</i>

497
00:39:10,251 --> 00:39:12,066
Harry, he's definitely gone.

498
00:39:12,166 --> 00:39:14,331
<i>You realize there are no
bowling alleys in Bruges?</i>

499
00:39:14,431 --> 00:39:16,896
I realize that, Harry.
The boy wanted to have a look anyway.

500
00:39:16,996 --> 00:39:19,362
<i>What are they gonna have,
a medieval fucking bowling alley?</i>

501
00:39:19,434 --> 00:39:21,799
As I say, I think he was just glad
to get out and about.

502
00:39:21,899 --> 00:39:24,763
<i>So, is he having a nice time,
seeing all the canals and that?</i>

503
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,998
<i>I had a lovely time
when I was there.</i>

504
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:29,597
<i>All the canals and the
old buildings and that.</i>

505
00:39:29,697 --> 00:39:30,764
When were you here?

506
00:39:30,863 --> 00:39:34,682
<i>When I was seven.
Last happy holiday I fucking had.</i>

507
00:39:35,185 --> 00:39:37,797
<i>- Have you been on a canal trip, yet?</i>
- Yeah.

508
00:39:37,897 --> 00:39:41,097
<i>Have you been down, like, all the
old cobbled streets and that?</i> - Yeah.

509
00:39:41,197 --> 00:39:43,495
<i>It's like a fairytale, isn't
it, that place?</i> - Yeah.

510
00:39:43,565 --> 00:39:45,523
<i>With the churches and that.
They're Gothic.</i> - Yeah.

511
00:39:45,568 --> 00:39:47,097
<i>- Is it Gothic?</i>
- Yeah.

512
00:39:47,197 --> 00:39:49,731
<i>So he's having a really nice time?</i>

513
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:52,634
Well, I'm having a really nice time.

514
00:39:52,734 --> 00:39:55,480
I'm not sure if it's
really his cup of tea.

515
00:39:58,218 --> 00:39:59,343
<i>What?</i>

516
00:39:59,851 --> 00:40:01,829
You know, I'm not sure
if it's really his thing.

517
00:40:01,929 --> 00:40:03,532
<i>What do you mean,
"It's not really his thing"?</i>

518
00:40:03,632 --> 00:40:05,732
<i>What's that supposed to mean,
"It's not really his thing"?</i>

519
00:40:05,831 --> 00:40:07,133
<i>What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?</i>

520
00:40:07,233 --> 00:40:08,230
Nothing, Harry.

521
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:10,397
<i>It's a fairytale
fucking town, isn't it?</i>

522
00:40:10,497 --> 00:40:13,232
<i>How can a fairytale town not be
somebody's fucking thing?</i>

523
00:40:13,332 --> 00:40:16,431
<i>How can all those canals and bridges
and cobbled streets and those churches,</i>

524
00:40:16,531 --> 00:40:18,765
<i>all that beautiful
fucking fairytale stuff,</i>

525
00:40:18,865 --> 00:40:20,734
<i>how can that not be
somebody's fucking thing, eh?</i>

526
00:40:20,834 --> 00:40:22,140
What I think I meant to say was:

527
00:40:22,233 --> 00:40:23,999
<i>- Is the swan still there?</i>
- Yeah, the swan's...

528
00:40:24,099 --> 00:40:27,198
<i>How can fucking swans not fucking
be somebody's fucking thing, eh?</i>

529
00:40:27,298 --> 00:40:28,398
<i>How can that be?</i>

530
00:40:28,498 --> 00:40:29,598
What I think I meant to say was,

531
00:40:29,698 --> 00:40:32,831
when he first arrived,
he wasn't quite sure about it.

532
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:36,896
You know, there's that big, dual
carriageway when you get off the train?

533
00:40:36,996 --> 00:40:39,233
It mightn't have been here when you
were here last, Harry.

534
00:40:39,333 --> 00:40:42,268
Well, as soon as he got into,
like, the old town proper,

535
00:40:42,368 --> 00:40:46,201
and he saw the canals and the bridges and,
you know, the swans and that,

536
00:40:46,301 --> 00:40:48,201
well, he just
fucking loved it then.

537
00:40:48,301 --> 00:40:51,796
Couldn't get enough of it,
the medieval part of town.

538
00:40:51,896 --> 00:40:56,498
It was just that initial, dual carriageway
thing sort of put him off for a second.

539
00:40:56,598 --> 00:40:58,465
<i>Don't know if I remember
a dual carriageway.</i>

540
00:40:58,565 --> 00:40:59,667
<i>Must be recent.</i>

541
00:40:59,766 --> 00:41:01,100
<i>Hasn't spoilt it, has it?</i>

542
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,447
No, no, no, it's just that
initial thing.

543
00:41:06,918 --> 00:41:08,612
And you know what?

544
00:41:09,851 --> 00:41:11,964
As we were walking
through the streets,

545
00:41:12,064 --> 00:41:17,211
there was this sort of freezing fog
hanging over everything,

546
00:41:17,652 --> 00:41:21,433
and it made it look almost like
a fairytale or something.

547
00:41:21,533 --> 00:41:23,029
And he turned to me,
do you know what he said?

548
00:41:23,129 --> 00:41:24,663
<i>What'd he say?</i>

549
00:41:24,763 --> 00:41:29,763
He said, "Ken, I know I'm awake,
but I feel like I'm in a dream."

550
00:41:29,863 --> 00:41:32,200
<i>Yeah? He said that?</i>

551
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,297
Yeah.

552
00:41:33,397 --> 00:41:35,930
<i>Meaning, like, in a good dream?</i>

553
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:38,867
Yeah. Of course,
like in a good dream.

554
00:41:38,967 --> 00:41:42,334
<i>Oh, good. I'm glad he likes it there.</i>

555
00:41:42,434 --> 00:41:44,368
<i>I'm glad we were able
to give him something.</i>

556
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:48,282
<i>Something good and happy.
Because he wasn't a bad kid, was he?</i>

557
00:41:49,718 --> 00:41:50,809
Huh?

558
00:41:51,085 --> 00:41:53,449
<i>He wasn't a bad kid, was he?</i>

559
00:41:54,552 --> 00:41:57,564
<i>Listen, take down this address.
Raamstraat 17.</i>

560
00:41:57,663 --> 00:42:00,708
<i>That's "Raam", like "Ram",
but with an extra "a"</i>

561
00:42:01,684 --> 00:42:02,763
Raamstraat 17.

562
00:42:02,863 --> 00:42:04,442
<i>You got that?</i>

563
00:42:04,818 --> 00:42:06,234
Yes, Raamstraat 17.

564
00:42:06,334 --> 00:42:10,533
<i>Good. There'll be a man there
tomorrow morning at 9::00, his name's Yuri.</i>

565
00:42:10,632 --> 00:42:12,299
- Yuri.
<i>- He'll give you the gun.</i>

566
00:42:12,399 --> 00:42:14,275
<i>Ring me on the public phone
at Jimmy Driscoll's</i>

567
00:42:14,368 --> 00:42:17,182
<i>about 3:00 or 4:00 tomorrow,
after it's done.</i>

568
00:42:18,151 --> 00:42:19,810
After what's done?

569
00:42:20,518 --> 00:42:22,279
<i>Are you being thick?</i>

570
00:42:23,985 --> 00:42:25,665
- No.
<i>- Listen, I like Ray.</i>

571
00:42:25,765 --> 00:42:28,134
<i>He was a good bloke, but when
it all comes down to it, you know,</i>

572
00:42:28,234 --> 00:42:30,063
<i>he blew the head off a
little fucking kid.</i>

573
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:31,322
<i>And you brought him in, Ken.</i>

574
00:42:31,397 --> 00:42:34,839
<i>So if the buck don't stop with him,
where does it stop?</i>

575
00:42:40,352 --> 00:42:41,409
<i>Ken?</i>

576
00:42:42,584 --> 00:42:44,933
<i>If the buck don't stop with him,
where does it stop?</i>

577
00:42:45,033 --> 00:42:46,996
It stops with me, Harry.
That's an easy one.

578
00:42:47,096 --> 00:42:49,210
<i>Look, don't get shirty, Ken.</i>

579
00:42:50,118 --> 00:42:55,034
<i>Listen, I'm just glad that I was able
to do something for the boy before he went.</i>

580
00:42:55,134 --> 00:42:56,731
Do what for the boy?

581
00:42:56,831 --> 00:42:59,250
<i>You know, have him get to see Bruges.</i>

582
00:43:00,085 --> 00:43:03,245
<i>I'd like to go to see
Bruges again before I die.</i>

583
00:43:04,018 --> 00:43:07,542
<i>What was it he said again about:
Yeah, "It's like a dream"</i>

584
00:43:09,318 --> 00:43:12,579
"I know I'm awake, but I feel like
I'm in a dream."

585
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:16,142
<i>Yeah.</i>

586
00:43:18,018 --> 00:43:20,314
<i>Give me a call when he's dead.</i>

587
00:43:44,385 --> 00:43:47,767
That's my fucking girlfriend,
you asshole.

588
00:43:47,867 --> 00:43:49,065
Eirik, what are you doing?

589
00:43:49,165 --> 00:43:50,899
Where are you from, fucker?

590
00:43:50,999 --> 00:43:52,451
Ireland, originally.

591
00:43:53,251 --> 00:43:55,499
And you think it's okay
to come over to Belgium

592
00:43:55,598 --> 00:43:57,332
and fuck another man's girl?

593
00:43:57,432 --> 00:43:59,233
Look, I didn't know
she had a boyfriend, all right?

594
00:43:59,333 --> 00:44:00,738
And I haven't fucked her, anyway.

595
00:44:00,764 --> 00:44:02,293
Ask her.
I'd only put me hand on it.

596
00:44:02,368 --> 00:44:04,318
Eirik, put the gun down!

597
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:07,934
Get down on your knees
and open your mouth.

598
00:44:08,034 --> 00:44:09,563
Don't start being silly.

599
00:44:09,663 --> 00:44:11,413
Get down on your --

600
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:15,897
Exactly at what point was it that
all skinheads suddenly became poofs?

601
00:44:15,997 --> 00:44:17,131
Used to be,
you were a skinhead,

602
00:44:17,231 --> 00:44:19,466
you just went around beating up
Pakistani 12-year-olds.

603
00:44:19,565 --> 00:44:22,847
Now it seems a prerequisite
to be a fucking bum-boy!

604
00:44:24,385 --> 00:44:25,764
That's not gonna help you, man.

605
00:44:25,864 --> 00:44:28,612
Ray, there's only
blanks in that gun.

606
00:44:34,985 --> 00:44:36,766
Eirik, don't!

607
00:44:36,866 --> 00:44:38,133
Now who's the fucking bum-boy?

608
00:44:38,233 --> 00:44:40,545
You, you fucking bum-boy!

609
00:44:42,618 --> 00:44:44,433
Chloe, what exactly
is going on here?

610
00:44:44,532 --> 00:44:46,664
I can't see!
I can't see!

611
00:44:46,764 --> 00:44:48,214
Of course you can't fucking see!

612
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,759
I just shot a blank
in your fucking eyes!

613
00:44:51,234 --> 00:44:56,134
- Is this fella your boyfriend?
- No. I mean, he used to be.

614
00:44:56,234 --> 00:44:57,365
Well, what's he doing here?

615
00:44:57,464 --> 00:45:00,868
We... We rob tourists, sometimes.

616
00:45:00,968 --> 00:45:03,883
I fucking knew it was too good
to be true!

617
00:45:04,251 --> 00:45:06,045
I knew you'd have never
shagged me, normally.

618
00:45:06,099 --> 00:45:08,299
No! That's not true, I...

619
00:45:08,399 --> 00:45:11,733
I called it off tonight.
I told him not to come tonight.

620
00:45:11,833 --> 00:45:12,931
Why did you come tonight?

621
00:45:13,031 --> 00:45:14,698
Chloe, I can't see,
I swear it!

622
00:45:14,798 --> 00:45:17,263
Stop whingeing like a big gay baby.

623
00:45:17,363 --> 00:45:18,897
I haven't had a shag in months!

624
00:45:18,997 --> 00:45:23,963
I can't see out of this eye, Chloe!
I have to go to the hospital!

625
00:45:24,063 --> 00:45:25,765
I'll drive you.

626
00:45:25,865 --> 00:45:27,598
Great! Now the
whole night's ruined!

627
00:45:27,698 --> 00:45:28,932
No!

628
00:45:29,032 --> 00:45:30,642
You can stay if you want.

629
00:45:30,668 --> 00:45:32,987
I just don't know
how long I'll be.

630
00:45:33,062 --> 00:45:35,900
I just knew someone like you
would never like someone like me.

631
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,732
- I just knew.
- What do you mean, someone like me?

632
00:45:38,832 --> 00:45:40,784
You know, someone nice.

633
00:45:48,151 --> 00:45:50,639
Call me. Please.

634
00:45:55,918 --> 00:45:57,179
Chloe!

635
00:46:37,118 --> 00:46:38,106
Cha-ching!

636
00:47:07,884 --> 00:47:09,533
Have you got some
sort of problem?

637
00:47:09,633 --> 00:47:11,268
No, no problem.

638
00:47:11,467 --> 00:47:14,179
Four beers in 20 minutes.
No problem.

639
00:47:16,118 --> 00:47:17,378
Fuck off.

640
00:47:25,484 --> 00:47:27,597
Beer and a red wine.

641
00:47:27,697 --> 00:47:29,150
I'll be back.

642
00:47:31,718 --> 00:47:33,499
How's the movie going?

643
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:37,731
It's a jumped-up Eurotrash
piece of rip-off fucking bullshit.

644
00:47:37,831 --> 00:47:39,750
Like, in a bad way?

645
00:47:43,251 --> 00:47:44,931
Your girlfriend's very pretty.

646
00:47:45,031 --> 00:47:46,495
She ain't my girlfriend.

647
00:47:46,721 --> 00:47:49,239
She's a prostitute I just picked up.

648
00:47:50,884 --> 00:47:53,362
Didn't know there were
any prostitutes in Bruges.

649
00:47:53,462 --> 00:47:55,834
You just have to look
in the right places.

650
00:47:55,934 --> 00:47:57,577
Brothels are good.

651
00:47:59,118 --> 00:48:02,096
Well, you've picked up
a very pretty prostitute.

652
00:48:02,196 --> 00:48:03,548
Thank you.

653
00:48:08,018 --> 00:48:09,779
You from the States?

654
00:48:10,618 --> 00:48:11,743
Yeah.

655
00:48:12,118 --> 00:48:13,567
But don't hold it against me.

656
00:48:13,667 --> 00:48:15,015
I'll try not to.

657
00:48:16,517 --> 00:48:19,574
Just try not to say
anything too loud or crass.

658
00:48:37,284 --> 00:48:39,633
Hey-ho.
Drowning your sorrows, huh?

659
00:48:39,733 --> 00:48:40,858
What sorrows?

660
00:48:40,884 --> 00:48:43,457
You know,
being a sad, old, ugly little man.

661
00:48:43,531 --> 00:48:44,697
One gay beer, please.

662
00:48:44,797 --> 00:48:45,897
How'd your date go?

663
00:48:45,997 --> 00:48:48,199
My date involved two instances of
extreme violence.

664
00:48:48,298 --> 00:48:50,296
One instance of her hand on my cock
and my finger up her thing,

665
00:48:50,396 --> 00:48:53,267
which lasted all too briefly.
Isn't that always the way?

666
00:48:53,367 --> 00:48:56,734
One instance of me stealing five grams of
her very-high-quality cocaine,

667
00:48:56,834 --> 00:48:58,964
and one instance of me
blinding a poofy little skinhead.

668
00:48:59,064 --> 00:49:02,231
So, all in all, my evening
pretty much balanced out fine.

669
00:49:02,331 --> 00:49:04,408
You got five grams of coke?

670
00:49:05,185 --> 00:49:06,865
I've got four grams on me
and one gram in me,

671
00:49:06,965 --> 00:49:08,232
which is why me heart
is going like the clappers,

672
00:49:08,332 --> 00:49:09,531
as if I'm about to
have a heart attack.

673
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:11,798
So if I collapse any minute now,
please remember to tell the doctors

674
00:49:11,898 --> 00:49:13,497
that it might have something
to do with the coke.

675
00:49:13,597 --> 00:49:15,001
Give us a gram, then.

676
00:49:15,101 --> 00:49:17,035
I thought you were laying off,
because it makes you depressed?

677
00:49:17,135 --> 00:49:20,515
You know what? Right now,
I don't really give a fuck.

678
00:49:48,684 --> 00:49:51,797
Why didn't you wave hello to me
today when I waved hello to you today?

679
00:49:51,897 --> 00:49:54,429
I was on a very strong
horse tranquilizer today.

680
00:49:54,529 --> 00:49:59,415
I wasn't waving hello to anybody,
except maybe to a horse.

681
00:49:59,884 --> 00:50:02,300
Huh? What are you
talking about?

682
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,441
Just horseshit.

683
00:50:05,451 --> 00:50:07,164
You from America?

684
00:50:07,264 --> 00:50:09,796
Yeah. But don't
hold it against me.

685
00:50:09,896 --> 00:50:12,800
Well, that's for me
to decide, isn't it?

686
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:14,300
Are you from America, too?

687
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:15,896
No, I'm from Amsterdam.

688
00:50:15,996 --> 00:50:17,367
Amsterdam.

689
00:50:17,467 --> 00:50:20,266
Amsterdam is just a load of
bloody prostitutes, isn't it?

690
00:50:20,366 --> 00:50:22,329
Yes. That's why I came to Bruges.

691
00:50:22,429 --> 00:50:25,679
I thought I'd get
a better price for my pussy here.

692
00:50:27,451 --> 00:50:28,439
Huh?

693
00:50:30,051 --> 00:50:31,710
You two are weird.

694
00:50:33,818 --> 00:50:35,943
Would you like some cocaine?

695
00:50:38,484 --> 00:50:41,279
I've also got some
acid and some ecstasy.

696
00:50:52,117 --> 00:50:54,595
Hervé Villechaize, I know, did.

697
00:50:54,695 --> 00:50:57,445
The dwarf off, I think,
<i>The Time Bandits</i>, did.

698
00:50:58,684 --> 00:51:00,343
Lots of midgets --

699
00:51:00,918 --> 00:51:03,440
Dwarves, top themselves.

700
00:51:04,183 --> 00:51:05,645
Shitloads.

701
00:51:08,484 --> 00:51:09,848
Would you ever think about it?

702
00:51:10,284 --> 00:51:11,272
Huh?

703
00:51:11,618 --> 00:51:14,967
Would you ever think about killing
yourself because you're a midget?

704
00:51:15,067 --> 00:51:18,096
Fuck, man!
What kind of question is that?

705
00:51:18,196 --> 00:51:19,941
We're just chatting,
aren't we?

706
00:51:26,451 --> 00:51:29,530
See, Ken, this is the kind of hotel
Harry should have put us in.

707
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:32,050
A five-star, with prostitutes in.

708
00:51:32,718 --> 00:51:37,309
You know, sometimes, I think Harry
doesn't even give a shit about us at all.

709
00:51:38,784 --> 00:51:40,750
Has he still not called?

710
00:51:42,551 --> 00:51:44,163
No. Still hasn't called.

711
00:51:44,263 --> 00:51:45,841
No news is good news, eh?

712
00:51:57,417 --> 00:51:58,747
Who's she?

713
00:52:00,618 --> 00:52:02,743
There's gonna be a war, man.

714
00:52:03,618 --> 00:52:04,933
I can see it.

715
00:52:05,032 --> 00:52:08,996
There's gonna be a war between the
blacks and between the whites.

716
00:52:09,095 --> 00:52:11,534
You ain't even gonna need
a uniform no more.

717
00:52:11,634 --> 00:52:14,264
This ain't gonna be a war
where you pick your side.

718
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:15,767
Your side's already
picked for you.

719
00:52:15,867 --> 00:52:18,863
And I know whose side I'm fighting on.
I'm fighting with the blacks.

720
00:52:18,963 --> 00:52:20,597
The whites are gonna get
their heads kicked in!

721
00:52:20,697 --> 00:52:22,899
You don't decide this shit, man.

722
00:52:22,999 --> 00:52:24,875
Well, who are the half-castes
gonna fight with?

723
00:52:24,967 --> 00:52:27,597
The blacks, man.
That's obvious.

724
00:52:27,697 --> 00:52:30,115
But what about the Pakistanis?

725
00:52:31,184 --> 00:52:33,810
- The blacks.
- What about...

726
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,340
Think of a hard one.

727
00:52:37,317 --> 00:52:39,363
What about the Vietnamese?

728
00:52:39,463 --> 00:52:40,901
The blacks!

729
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:45,542
Well, I'm definitely fighting with
the blacks if they've got the Vietnamese.

730
00:52:49,651 --> 00:52:51,048
So, hang on.

731
00:52:51,951 --> 00:52:53,698
Would all of the white midgets
in the world be fighting

732
00:52:53,798 --> 00:52:55,200
against all the black
midgets in the world?

733
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:57,045
Yeah.

734
00:52:57,751 --> 00:52:59,876
That would make a good film!

735
00:53:00,751 --> 00:53:05,479
You don't know how much shit I've had
to take off of black midgets, man.

736
00:53:06,017 --> 00:53:07,313
That's...

737
00:53:08,918 --> 00:53:10,632
Undeniably true.

738
00:53:10,732 --> 00:53:12,183
See, Jimmy,

739
00:53:13,684 --> 00:53:15,343
my wife was black.

740
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:18,973
And I loved her very much.

741
00:53:20,084 --> 00:53:25,073
And in 1976, she was murdered
by a white man. So,

742
00:53:26,784 --> 00:53:31,043
where the fuck am I supposed
to stand in all this blood and carnage?

743
00:53:32,551 --> 00:53:34,881
Did they get the guy who did it?

744
00:53:35,317 --> 00:53:36,496
A friend of mine got him.

745
00:53:36,596 --> 00:53:38,607
Harry Waters got him.

746
00:53:40,084 --> 00:53:44,915
So tell me, Jim, whose side do I fight
on in this wonderful war?

747
00:53:47,984 --> 00:53:51,041
I think you need to
weigh up all your options

748
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:54,673
and let your conscience decide, Ken.

749
00:54:03,917 --> 00:54:08,009
Two manky hookers
and a racist dwarf.

750
00:54:08,551 --> 00:54:09,697
I think I'm heading home.

751
00:54:09,797 --> 00:54:12,215
Yeah. I think I'll come with you.

752
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:17,028
- What's...
- Back off, shorty!

753
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:19,000
You don't know karate.

754
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:20,061
Don't say you didn't
have it coming.

755
00:54:20,161 --> 00:54:21,945
Don't say you didn't
have it coming.

756
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:23,580
Shortarse!

757
00:55:50,517 --> 00:55:51,697
Meeting Yuri.

758
00:55:51,796 --> 00:55:52,874
Yes, I'm Yuri.

759
00:56:22,484 --> 00:56:25,211
Mr. Waters said
that might be necessary.

760
00:56:28,451 --> 00:56:31,905
There are a lot of alcoves
in the Koningin Astrid Park.

761
00:56:32,817 --> 00:56:35,010
You use this word,
"alcoves"?

762
00:56:35,817 --> 00:56:38,031
"Alcoves"? Yes. Sometimes.

763
00:56:38,131 --> 00:56:42,277
There are not many people around
in these alcoves in Christmastime.

764
00:56:42,817 --> 00:56:46,147
If I were to murder a man,
I would murder him here.

765
00:56:48,917 --> 00:56:51,833
Are you sure this is
the right word, "alcoves"?

766
00:56:51,933 --> 00:56:53,441
Alcoves, yes.

767
00:56:53,766 --> 00:56:55,590
It's kind of like
nooks and crannies.

768
00:56:55,664 --> 00:56:59,730
"Nooks and crannies", yes.
Perhaps this would be more accurate.

769
00:56:59,830 --> 00:57:03,215
"Nooks and crannies",
rather than "alcoves". Yeah.

770
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:11,643
You are going to do it, aren't you?

771
00:57:11,768 --> 00:57:13,992
Mr. Waters will be
very disappointed...

772
00:57:14,067 --> 00:57:16,642
Of course I'm going to fucking do it.

773
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:19,740
It's what I do.

774
00:57:26,017 --> 00:57:29,279
Your friend was behaving
rather oddly this morning.

775
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:38,262
Oddly? How?

776
00:57:38,362 --> 00:57:42,477
Well, he asked me about the baby,
and if I wanted a boy or a girl.

777
00:57:43,317 --> 00:57:46,699
I said I didn't mind
as long as it's healthy, of course.

778
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:51,113
But then he gave me
200 euros to give to the baby.

779
00:57:52,717 --> 00:57:57,715
I refused, obviously,
but he was quite insistent.

780
00:57:59,351 --> 00:58:02,408
Would you give it back to him
when you see him?

781
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:07,162
I don't want to appear ungrateful,
but it seemed like all the money he had.

782
00:58:07,262 --> 00:58:11,239
- Do you know where he is now?
- He said he was going to the park.

783
00:59:10,783 --> 00:59:12,147
Sorry, Ray.

784
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:15,414
I'm sorry.

785
00:59:46,084 --> 00:59:47,264
Ray, don't!

786
00:59:47,364 --> 00:59:49,930
Fucking hell!
Where the fuck did you come from?

787
00:59:50,030 --> 00:59:52,995
- I was behind the thing.
- What the fuck are you doing, Ray?

788
00:59:53,095 --> 00:59:54,561
What the fuck are you doing?

789
00:59:54,661 --> 00:59:55,695
Nothing.

790
00:59:57,917 --> 00:59:59,315
Oh, my God!

791
01:00:01,351 --> 01:00:02,751
You were gonna kill me.

792
01:00:02,777 --> 01:00:04,133
No, I wasn't.

793
01:00:04,417 --> 01:00:06,575
You were gonna kill yourself!

794
01:00:09,317 --> 01:00:10,632
I'm allowed to.

795
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:11,729
No, you're not!

796
01:00:11,829 --> 01:00:12,942
What?

797
01:00:13,517 --> 01:00:16,449
I'm not allowed to and you are?
How's that fair?

798
01:00:23,583 --> 01:00:26,777
Can we go somewhere
and talk about this, please?

799
01:00:29,984 --> 01:00:32,164
I wasn't gonna go
through with it, Ray.

800
01:00:32,264 --> 01:00:36,307
You fucking looked like you were
gonna go fucking through with it.

801
01:00:38,351 --> 01:00:40,031
Where'd you get that gun?

802
01:00:40,131 --> 01:00:41,695
A friend of Harry's.

803
01:00:41,795 --> 01:00:43,113
Fuck, man.

804
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:47,239
Let me see it.

805
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:52,738
Silencer, too.

806
01:00:55,284 --> 01:00:56,375
Nice.

807
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:04,246
Mine's a bloody girl's gun.

808
01:01:13,384 --> 01:01:14,787
I'm keeping it.

809
01:01:15,113 --> 01:01:16,596
Pardon me?

810
01:01:18,150 --> 01:01:20,398
- Give me me gun back.
- You're not getting it back.

811
01:01:20,497 --> 01:01:21,596
You're a suicide case.

812
01:01:21,696 --> 01:01:24,398
And you were trying to
shoot me in the fucking head.

813
01:01:24,497 --> 01:01:26,029
You're not getting
that gun back.

814
01:01:26,129 --> 01:01:28,932
A great day this has
turned out to be.

815
01:01:29,032 --> 01:01:31,983
I'm suicidal,
me mate tries to kill me,

816
01:01:32,084 --> 01:01:35,675
me gun gets nicked
and we're still in fucking Bruges.

817
01:01:36,984 --> 01:01:41,266
Listen, I'm gonna give you some money
and put you on a train somewhere.

818
01:01:41,366 --> 01:01:42,699
Back to England?

819
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:44,671
You can't go back to England, Ray.

820
01:01:44,697 --> 01:01:45,820
You'd be a dead man!

821
01:01:45,895 --> 01:01:47,929
I want to be a dead man.

822
01:01:48,029 --> 01:01:49,676
Have you been missing something?

823
01:01:51,384 --> 01:01:53,679
You don't want to be
a dead man, Ray.

824
01:01:56,516 --> 01:01:58,380
I killed a little boy!

825
01:02:12,450 --> 01:02:14,678
Then save the next little boy.

826
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:18,173
Just go away somewhere,

827
01:02:18,917 --> 01:02:22,350
get out of this business
and try to do something good.

828
01:02:23,450 --> 01:02:25,939
You're not gonna
help anybody dead.

829
01:02:26,516 --> 01:02:29,108
You're not gonna
bring that boy back.

830
01:02:31,217 --> 01:02:33,546
But you might save the next one.

831
01:02:35,050 --> 01:02:37,278
What am I gonna be, a doctor?

832
01:02:37,984 --> 01:02:39,540
You need exams.

833
01:02:40,351 --> 01:02:42,976
Do anything, Ray.
Do anything.

834
01:02:59,516 --> 01:03:01,005
What a wanker!

835
01:03:03,017 --> 01:03:05,006
He said this whole trip,

836
01:03:07,084 --> 01:03:09,481
this whole being in Bruges thing,

837
01:03:10,250 --> 01:03:14,046
was just to give you one last,
joyful memory before you died.

838
01:03:15,516 --> 01:03:16,880
In Bruges?

839
01:03:22,583 --> 01:03:24,311
The Bahamas, maybe.

840
01:03:26,284 --> 01:03:28,011
Why fucking Bruges?

841
01:03:28,683 --> 01:03:30,615
I suppose it's cheaper.

842
01:03:37,317 --> 01:03:39,908
The rest of the acid
and the ecstasy.

843
01:03:40,984 --> 01:03:43,280
Can I have me gun back, please?

844
01:03:48,284 --> 01:03:50,250
What am I gonna do, Ken?

845
01:03:51,350 --> 01:03:52,753
What am I gonna do?

846
01:03:53,179 --> 01:03:54,634
Just keep moving.

847
01:03:55,117 --> 01:03:57,033
Keep on moving.

848
01:03:57,133 --> 01:03:59,174
Try not to think about it.

849
01:04:00,450 --> 01:04:01,866
Learn a new language, maybe?

850
01:04:01,966 --> 01:04:03,928
Sure, I can hardly do English.

851
01:04:04,028 --> 01:04:05,231
That's one thing
I like about Europe, though.

852
01:04:05,330 --> 01:04:07,395
You don't have to learn
any of their languages.

853
01:04:07,495 --> 01:04:10,164
Just forget about home for a while.

854
01:04:10,264 --> 01:04:13,694
See how the land lies
in six years, seven years.

855
01:04:13,794 --> 01:04:15,976
Seven years is not that long.

856
01:04:16,650 --> 01:04:18,729
It's longer than that boy got.

857
01:04:18,829 --> 01:04:21,305
Me first fucking job.

858
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:24,980
Great hitman I turned out to be.

859
01:04:28,817 --> 01:04:31,749
Some people just aren't
cut out for it, Ray.

860
01:04:32,383 --> 01:04:33,610
Are you?

861
01:04:39,883 --> 01:04:42,405
When are you
going back to England?

862
01:04:43,184 --> 01:04:45,229
I'll head back in a couple
of hours or something.

863
01:04:45,328 --> 01:04:48,942
Harry's not gonna be mad at you,
is he? For letting me go?

864
01:04:49,583 --> 01:04:50,595
I'll sort out Harry.

865
01:04:50,695 --> 01:04:53,864
Just tell him I'll have probably
killed meself in a fortnight, anyway.

866
01:04:53,964 --> 01:04:55,939
You won't, will you, Ray?

867
01:05:15,383 --> 01:05:17,766
Harry? It's Ken.

868
01:05:17,866 --> 01:05:19,440
Listen to this noise.

869
01:05:21,817 --> 01:05:24,031
Do you know what that is?

870
01:05:24,131 --> 01:05:25,853
Yeah, I know you
know it's a train.

871
01:05:25,979 --> 01:05:27,625
Do you know what train?

872
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:29,944
Well, it's a train
that Ray just got on,

873
01:05:30,070 --> 01:05:31,491
and he's alive and he's well,

874
01:05:31,566 --> 01:05:33,933
and he doesn't know
where he's going and neither do I.

875
01:05:34,033 --> 01:05:36,832
So if you need to do your worst,
do your worst.

876
01:05:36,932 --> 01:05:40,131
You've got the address of the hotel.
I'll be here waiting.

877
01:05:40,230 --> 01:05:43,262
Because I've got to quite
like Bruges, now.

878
01:05:43,362 --> 01:05:45,339
It's like a fucking
fairytale or something.

879
01:06:14,984 --> 01:06:16,176
Harry.

880
01:06:16,984 --> 01:06:18,143
Harry!

881
01:06:18,683 --> 01:06:19,762
What?

882
01:06:19,862 --> 01:06:21,896
It's an inanimate fucking object.

883
01:06:21,996 --> 01:06:24,472
You're an inanimate fucking object!

884
01:06:34,650 --> 01:06:37,497
Now, you lot be good for your mummy
and Imamoto, okay?

885
01:06:37,597 --> 01:06:39,561
'Cause Daddy's got to
go away for a few days.

886
01:06:39,661 --> 01:06:40,628
Where are you going?

887
01:06:40,728 --> 01:06:42,195
I've got to go to Bruges.

888
01:06:42,295 --> 01:06:43,862
Bruges? Where's that?

889
01:06:43,962 --> 01:06:45,007
It's in Belgium.

890
01:06:46,383 --> 01:06:48,766
Why would anybody
have to go to Belgium?

891
01:06:48,866 --> 01:06:51,530
'Cause I've got to
sort something out.

892
01:06:51,630 --> 01:06:54,033
Is it something
to do with the phone?

893
01:06:54,132 --> 01:06:55,878
It's something to do with Ken.

894
01:06:57,617 --> 01:06:59,412
It's a matter of honor.

895
01:07:00,617 --> 01:07:03,344
Well, it ain't gonna
be dangerous, is it?

896
01:07:06,283 --> 01:07:09,565
Well, of course it's gonna be dangerous
if it's a matter of fucking honor!

897
01:07:09,665 --> 01:07:11,174
You are bringing the fellas with you?

898
01:07:11,227 --> 01:07:14,081
Tell me you're bringing
the fellas with you.

899
01:07:14,583 --> 01:07:15,844
Harry.

900
01:07:16,483 --> 01:07:19,298
I'm sorry for calling you
an inanimate object.

901
01:07:19,398 --> 01:07:20,781
I was upset.

902
01:09:00,550 --> 01:09:03,015
- You're Irish?
- Yes.

903
01:09:04,483 --> 01:09:06,142
What is your name?

904
01:09:08,350 --> 01:09:10,407
Derek Perlurrl.

905
01:09:14,249 --> 01:09:16,010
You hit the Canadian.

906
01:09:16,683 --> 01:09:18,532
You hit the Canadian.

907
01:09:18,632 --> 01:09:22,572
I "heet" the Canadian?
I don't know what you're talking about.

908
01:09:25,283 --> 01:09:27,806
That's him!
That's the motherfucker.

909
01:09:34,083 --> 01:09:36,174
You hit the Canadian, yeah?

910
01:09:37,183 --> 01:09:39,342
Canadian? Shit.

911
01:09:45,883 --> 01:09:48,815
- We're taking you back to Bruges.
- Brilliant.

912
01:10:16,416 --> 01:10:17,643
Aye aye.

913
01:10:18,717 --> 01:10:20,808
Take your pick, Mr. Waters.

914
01:10:24,116 --> 01:10:26,032
An Uzi?

915
01:10:26,132 --> 01:10:28,965
I'm not from South Central
Los fucking Angeles.

916
01:10:29,065 --> 01:10:32,764
I didn't come here to shoot 20 black
10-year-olds in a fucking drive-by.

917
01:10:32,864 --> 01:10:35,577
I want a normal gun
for a normal person.

918
01:10:47,149 --> 01:10:49,498
I knew he wouldn't kill the guy.

919
01:10:49,598 --> 01:10:53,743
I could see it in his eyes
when I was telling him about the alcoves.

920
01:10:54,949 --> 01:10:56,529
- About the what?
- The alcoves.

921
01:10:56,629 --> 01:10:59,378
The alcoves in the
Koningin Astrid Park.

922
01:11:02,016 --> 01:11:04,230
Oh, I also have some dumdums.

923
01:11:04,330 --> 01:11:07,761
You use this word, "dumdums"?
The bullets that make the head explode?

924
01:11:07,861 --> 01:11:09,198
Dumdums, yeah.

925
01:11:09,298 --> 01:11:11,874
Would you like some
of these dumdums?

926
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:14,144
I know I shouldn't,

927
01:11:15,783 --> 01:11:17,146
but I will.

928
01:11:22,149 --> 01:11:23,615
Motherfucker.

929
01:11:24,916 --> 01:11:25,928
Is he talking to me?

930
01:11:26,028 --> 01:11:28,162
No, Eirik's on your side,
Mr. Waters.

931
01:11:28,262 --> 01:11:30,261
Your young friend
blinded him last night.

932
01:11:30,361 --> 01:11:31,395
Ray did?

933
01:11:31,495 --> 01:11:34,779
I was trying to rob him
and he took my gun from me.

934
01:11:36,049 --> 01:11:38,398
And the gun
was full of blanks,

935
01:11:38,498 --> 01:11:40,108
and he shot the blank
into my eye.

936
01:11:41,216 --> 01:11:45,774
And now, I cannot see from this eye
ever again, the doctors say.

937
01:11:46,483 --> 01:11:49,798
Well, to be honest, it sounds like
it was all your fault.

938
01:11:49,897 --> 01:11:50,894
What?

939
01:11:50,994 --> 01:11:53,765
I mean, basically, if you're robbing
a man and you're only carrying blanks,

940
01:11:53,864 --> 01:11:55,766
and you allow your gun
to be taken off you,

941
01:11:55,865 --> 01:11:58,063
and you allow yourself to be shot
in the eye with a blank,

942
01:11:58,163 --> 01:12:01,695
for which I assume the person has to get
quite close to you, then,

943
01:12:01,795 --> 01:12:05,030
yeah, really, it's all your fault
for being such a poof.

944
01:12:05,130 --> 01:12:08,032
So why don't you stop whingeing
and cheer the fuck up?

945
01:12:08,132 --> 01:12:10,674
Eirik, I really wouldn't respond.

946
01:12:17,816 --> 01:12:18,996
I thought you wanted the guy dead?

947
01:12:19,096 --> 01:12:21,217
I do want the guy dead.
I want him fucking crucified.

948
01:12:21,296 --> 01:12:22,411
But it don't change the fact

949
01:12:22,437 --> 01:12:24,725
that he stitched you up
like a blind, little gay boy.

950
01:12:24,765 --> 01:12:25,872
Does it?

951
01:12:27,617 --> 01:12:29,606
Thanks for the gun, Yuri.

952
01:13:36,550 --> 01:13:37,641
Well?

953
01:13:39,782 --> 01:13:41,699
The boy is suicidal, Harry.

954
01:13:41,798 --> 01:13:43,771
He's a walking dead man.

955
01:13:44,617 --> 01:13:46,595
Keeps going on
about Hell and purgatory...

956
01:13:46,695 --> 01:13:49,065
When I phoned you
yesterday, did I ask you,

957
01:13:49,165 --> 01:13:52,695
"Ken, will you do me a favor and
become Ray's psychiatrist, please?"

958
01:13:52,794 --> 01:13:54,624
No. What I think
I asked you was,

959
01:13:54,650 --> 01:13:57,286
"Could you go blow his
fucking head off for me?"

960
01:13:57,361 --> 01:13:59,328
"He's suicidal"?

961
01:13:59,428 --> 01:14:02,894
I'm suicidal. You're suicidal.
Everybody's fucking suicidal!

962
01:14:02,994 --> 01:14:05,163
We don't all keep
going on about it!

963
01:14:05,263 --> 01:14:09,599
Has he killed himself yet?
No. So he's not fucking suicidal, is he?

964
01:14:09,698 --> 01:14:11,404
He put a loaded gun
to his head this morning.

965
01:14:11,430 --> 01:14:12,130
I stopped him.

966
01:14:12,165 --> 01:14:14,672
He... What?
This gets fucking worse!

967
01:14:15,583 --> 01:14:16,685
We were down in the park...

968
01:14:16,761 --> 01:14:20,693
Let me get this right.
You were down in the park?

969
01:14:20,793 --> 01:14:22,895
What's that got to do
with fucking anything?

970
01:14:22,995 --> 01:14:25,832
Let me get this right. Not only
have you refused to kill the boy,

971
01:14:25,932 --> 01:14:28,096
you've even stopped the boy
from killing himself,

972
01:14:28,196 --> 01:14:29,430
which would have
solved my problem,

973
01:14:29,530 --> 01:14:30,763
which would have
solved your problem,

974
01:14:30,863 --> 01:14:32,732
which sounds like it would've
solved the boy's problem.

975
01:14:32,832 --> 01:14:34,429
It wouldn't have
solved his problem.

976
01:14:34,529 --> 01:14:38,461
Ken, if I had killed a little kid,
accidentally or otherwise,

977
01:14:38,561 --> 01:14:39,784
I wouldn't have thought twice.

978
01:14:39,863 --> 01:14:42,433
I'd have killed myself on the
fucking spot. On the fucking spot.

979
01:14:42,461 --> 01:14:45,096
I'd have stuck the gun in me mouth
on the fucking spot!

980
01:14:45,196 --> 01:14:48,795
That's you, Harry.
The boy has the capacity to change.

981
01:14:48,895 --> 01:14:51,383
The boy has the capacity to do
something decent with his life.

982
01:14:51,432 --> 01:14:54,848
Excuse me, Ken.
I have the capacity to change.

983
01:14:55,617 --> 01:14:59,174
Yeah, you do. You've the capacity
to get fucking worse!

984
01:14:59,782 --> 01:15:02,261
Yeah, now I'm
getting down to it!

985
01:15:02,361 --> 01:15:04,232
Harry, let's face it.

986
01:15:04,332 --> 01:15:06,996
And I'm not being funny,
I mean no disrespect,

987
01:15:07,096 --> 01:15:08,499
but you're a cunt.

988
01:15:08,599 --> 01:15:11,398
You're a cunt now,
you've always been a cunt.

989
01:15:11,498 --> 01:15:15,197
And the only thing that's gonna change is
you're gonna become an even bigger cunt.

990
01:15:15,297 --> 01:15:16,760
Maybe have some
more cunt kids.

991
01:15:16,860 --> 01:15:18,981
Leave my kids fucking out of it.
What have they done?

992
01:15:19,028 --> 01:15:21,432
You fucking retract that bit
about my cunt fucking kids!

993
01:15:21,532 --> 01:15:23,763
I retract that bit about
your cunt fucking kids.

994
01:15:23,863 --> 01:15:27,530
Insulting my fucking kids!
That's going overboard, mate!

995
01:15:27,629 --> 01:15:29,606
I retracted it, didn't I?

996
01:15:32,816 --> 01:15:34,028
Still leaves you being a cunt.

997
01:15:34,128 --> 01:15:36,474
Yeah, I fucking got that.

998
01:15:55,016 --> 01:15:56,641
Where's Ray now?

999
01:15:57,949 --> 01:16:00,595
Oh, right about now,
Ray is in one or other

1000
01:16:00,695 --> 01:16:06,240
of the one million towns in mainland Europe
it's possible to be in, other than here.

1001
01:16:20,149 --> 01:16:22,665
I'll get all the money back to you
soon as I get through to me friend.

1002
01:16:22,765 --> 01:16:24,328
It's not a problem,
Raymond.

1003
01:16:24,428 --> 01:16:27,062
And I'll get all your acid and
your ecstasy back to you, too.

1004
01:16:27,162 --> 01:16:28,560
English humor!

1005
01:16:28,660 --> 01:16:31,377
I'm assuming you've
got your gun on you.

1006
01:16:34,083 --> 01:16:36,533
That Yuri bloke's
a funny fella, isn't he?

1007
01:16:36,632 --> 01:16:37,775
He does yoga.

1008
01:16:39,149 --> 01:16:40,363
"The alcoves."

1009
01:16:40,463 --> 01:16:42,779
Was he going on
to you about the alcoves?

1010
01:16:44,116 --> 01:16:46,980
"The alcoves
in the Koningin Astrid Park."

1011
01:16:55,383 --> 01:16:58,860
Harry, I know you gotta do
what you gotta do.

1012
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:00,797
It's a bit crowded
round here, you know?

1013
01:17:00,897 --> 01:17:02,264
Well, I'm not gonna
have a shootout

1014
01:17:02,364 --> 01:17:04,837
in the middle of a thousand
fucking Belgians, am I?

1015
01:17:06,882 --> 01:17:10,361
Not to mention the other nationalities,
just on their holidays.

1016
01:17:12,216 --> 01:17:15,031
To see the swans and the Gothic
and all the fairytale stuff, eh?

1017
01:17:15,131 --> 01:17:17,621
Are you trying to
fucking wind me up?

1018
01:17:17,747 --> 01:17:18,490
No, Harry.

1019
01:17:18,564 --> 01:17:20,932
On top of calling me a cunt
and calling me kids cunts.

1020
01:17:21,032 --> 01:17:23,966
I might just have to
fucking shoot you right here.

1021
01:17:24,066 --> 01:17:25,276
Christ!

1022
01:17:28,616 --> 01:17:30,673
Let's go up the bell tower.

1023
01:17:31,749 --> 01:17:33,929
Be quiet up there
this time of evening.

1024
01:17:34,029 --> 01:17:35,675
Let's go up there.

1025
01:17:54,450 --> 01:17:57,075
Yeah. Canadians.

1026
01:17:57,916 --> 01:18:01,063
I feel a bit bad. They didn't kill
John Lennon, did they?

1027
01:18:01,163 --> 01:18:03,598
Anyway, supposed to turn up
to court here in two days.

1028
01:18:03,698 --> 01:18:04,718
Are you going to turn up?

1029
01:18:04,794 --> 01:18:05,794
Don't know.

1030
01:18:05,894 --> 01:18:08,110
What have I got to
stay for really?

1031
01:18:10,549 --> 01:18:13,175
The most beautiful woman

1032
01:18:14,882 --> 01:18:16,507
you've ever seen

1033
01:18:17,849 --> 01:18:19,940
in all of your stupid life.

1034
01:18:30,515 --> 01:18:32,399
The tower is closed this evening.

1035
01:18:32,498 --> 01:18:34,662
No way. It's supposed
to be open till 7:00.

1036
01:18:34,762 --> 01:18:36,828
The tower is usually
open until 7:00.

1037
01:18:36,928 --> 01:18:39,630
Yesterday an American
had a heart attack up the tower.

1038
01:18:39,730 --> 01:18:41,099
Today the tower is closed.

1039
01:18:41,199 --> 01:18:45,172
Here, cranky, here's 100 for you.
We're only gonna be 20 minutes.

1040
01:18:50,383 --> 01:18:56,462
The tower is closed this evening.

1041
01:18:56,562 --> 01:18:58,879
Understand, Englishman?

1042
01:19:38,149 --> 01:19:40,127
Jimmy, I've been wanting to say

1043
01:19:40,227 --> 01:19:43,463
I'm really sorry for
karate-chopping you the other night.

1044
01:19:43,563 --> 01:19:45,898
That was way out of order.

1045
01:19:45,998 --> 01:19:50,595
You know, Ray, I'd find it easier
to believe and forgive you, somehow,

1046
01:19:50,695 --> 01:19:55,762
if the two of you weren't
laughing straight in my fucking face!

1047
01:19:58,482 --> 01:20:00,812
It's for the goddamn movie, man.

1048
01:20:04,449 --> 01:20:06,472
It is a nice town, Harry.

1049
01:20:08,116 --> 01:20:10,105
I'm glad I got to see it.

1050
01:20:14,316 --> 01:20:18,428
I didn't mean to be taking the
piss out of it being a fairytale place.

1051
01:20:18,528 --> 01:20:20,344
It is a fairytale place.

1052
01:20:21,083 --> 01:20:22,776
It really is.

1053
01:20:23,016 --> 01:20:24,688
It's just a shame
it's in Belgium, really.

1054
01:20:24,762 --> 01:20:28,098
But then you figure if it wasn't
in Belgium, if it was somewhere good,

1055
01:20:28,198 --> 01:20:30,532
there'd be too many
people coming to see it.

1056
01:20:30,658 --> 01:20:32,533
It would spoil the whole thing.

1057
01:20:34,849 --> 01:20:37,077
Well, I'm glad I got to see it

1058
01:20:38,916 --> 01:20:40,404
before I died.

1059
01:20:47,549 --> 01:20:49,277
What are you doing?

1060
01:20:49,782 --> 01:20:51,698
What are you fucking doing?

1061
01:20:51,798 --> 01:20:53,611
I'm not fighting anymore, Harry.

1062
01:20:54,549 --> 01:20:57,743
All right, then I'm blowing
your fucking head off.

1063
01:20:59,616 --> 01:21:01,481
Don't come over all Gandhi.

1064
01:21:01,607 --> 01:21:03,295
What are you fucking doing?

1065
01:21:05,083 --> 01:21:06,729
Ken, stop messing about, please.

1066
01:21:06,829 --> 01:21:08,861
Pick up your gun. I know I'm going
to beat you anyway

1067
01:21:08,961 --> 01:21:11,574
- 'cause you're a spaz, but...
- Harry,

1068
01:21:13,116 --> 01:21:15,139
I'm totally in your debt.

1069
01:21:18,083 --> 01:21:21,208
The things that have
gone between us in the past,

1070
01:21:21,916 --> 01:21:23,697
I love you unreservedly
for all that.

1071
01:21:23,797 --> 01:21:24,941
What?

1072
01:21:25,916 --> 01:21:27,643
For your integrity.

1073
01:21:28,616 --> 01:21:30,173
For your honor.

1074
01:21:31,083 --> 01:21:32,480
I love you.

1075
01:21:34,916 --> 01:21:38,079
The boy had to be let go.

1076
01:21:39,682 --> 01:21:42,379
The boy had to be given a chance.

1077
01:21:42,582 --> 01:21:45,087
And if to do that,
I had to say,

1078
01:21:45,213 --> 01:21:47,952
"Fuck you, and fuck
what I owe you,

1079
01:21:48,027 --> 01:21:50,353
"and fuck everything
that's gone on between us",

1080
01:21:50,479 --> 01:21:52,769
then that's what I had to do.

1081
01:21:53,315 --> 01:21:55,304
But I'm not fighting you.

1082
01:21:56,849 --> 01:21:58,928
And I accept, totally,
everything you've got to do.

1083
01:21:59,028 --> 01:22:00,845
I accept it. Totally.

1084
01:22:04,682 --> 01:22:05,943
Oh, yeah?

1085
01:22:08,248 --> 01:22:09,339
Yeah.

1086
01:22:14,382 --> 01:22:18,974
Well, you say all that fucking stuff,
I can't fucking shoot you now, can I?

1087
01:22:20,349 --> 01:22:22,827
It's entirely up to you, Harry.

1088
01:22:22,927 --> 01:22:24,905
It's entirely your call.

1089
01:22:26,482 --> 01:22:29,312
All I'm saying is
I'm not fighting.

1090
01:22:36,716 --> 01:22:38,294
Oh, you fucking cunt!

1091
01:22:38,394 --> 01:22:39,896
Look, I'm not gonna
do nothing to you

1092
01:22:39,921 --> 01:22:43,703
just 'cause you're standing about
like Robert fucking Powell.

1093
01:22:44,315 --> 01:22:45,996
- Like who?
- Like Robert fucking Powell

1094
01:22:46,096 --> 01:22:47,998
out of <i>Jesus of</i>
fucking <i>Nazareth</i>!

1095
01:22:48,098 --> 01:22:49,241
My fucking leg!

1096
01:22:49,716 --> 01:22:53,860
The psycho dwarf turns out to just be
a loveable little schoolboy,

1097
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:56,260
and it's all some kind of
Boschian nightmare.

1098
01:22:56,360 --> 01:22:57,827
Kiss my ass!

1099
01:22:57,927 --> 01:23:02,076
I guess at least there weren't any
black people involved, eh, Jimmy?

1100
01:23:03,349 --> 01:23:04,713
I wasn't...

1101
01:23:05,549 --> 01:23:07,572
I wasn't talking about...

1102
01:23:08,749 --> 01:23:11,761
There's gonna be a war between
all the blacks and all the whites.

1103
01:23:11,861 --> 01:23:13,630
And all the black midgets
and all the white midgets,

1104
01:23:13,730 --> 01:23:15,862
which would actually
be really good.

1105
01:23:15,962 --> 01:23:17,696
That's just cocaine.

1106
01:23:17,796 --> 01:23:20,198
He didn't even want
the Vietnamese on his side!

1107
01:23:20,298 --> 01:23:22,407
That's just cocaine.

1108
01:23:23,382 --> 01:23:27,162
Listen, we're filming down
by the pointy building tonight.

1109
01:23:27,262 --> 01:23:29,737
It might actually be good for once.

1110
01:23:30,983 --> 01:23:33,062
You guys should come along.

1111
01:23:33,161 --> 01:23:38,077
We... I think we're just gonna have
a quiet one tonight, Jimmy.

1112
01:23:39,882 --> 01:23:41,541
That's how it is!

1113
01:23:43,549 --> 01:23:45,139
In another life.

1114
01:23:51,949 --> 01:23:54,040
They're great, aren't they?

1115
01:24:09,148 --> 01:24:11,671
You didn't. You didn't!

1116
01:25:00,349 --> 01:25:02,838
Mr. Waters? Mr. Waters?

1117
01:25:05,315 --> 01:25:07,804
- Who's that?
- It's Eirik.

1118
01:25:09,282 --> 01:25:11,214
- The blind boy?
- Yeah.

1119
01:25:12,716 --> 01:25:13,875
Yes.

1120
01:25:14,782 --> 01:25:17,029
What do you fucking want?

1121
01:25:17,129 --> 01:25:18,627
The guy you're looking for,

1122
01:25:18,727 --> 01:25:21,807
the guy Ray, he's downstairs
at the bar.

1123
01:25:58,082 --> 01:25:59,639
I'm sorry, Ken.

1124
01:26:00,816 --> 01:26:04,373
But you can't kill a kid
and expect to get away with it.

1125
01:26:06,349 --> 01:26:07,872
You just can't.

1126
01:26:23,215 --> 01:26:25,829
- Where?
- To the left when you come out.

1127
01:26:25,929 --> 01:26:27,711
The bar to the left.

1128
01:29:44,716 --> 01:29:45,962
Ken!

1129
01:29:48,682 --> 01:29:50,614
Ken! Ken!

1130
01:29:52,616 --> 01:29:54,104
Harry's here.

1131
01:29:56,315 --> 01:29:57,406
What?

1132
01:29:58,881 --> 01:30:00,074
Take

1133
01:30:01,748 --> 01:30:03,009
my gun.

1134
01:30:16,382 --> 01:30:17,507
Ken?

1135
01:30:18,616 --> 01:30:20,138
Where's my gun?

1136
01:30:22,115 --> 01:30:23,706
Where's my gun?

1137
01:30:26,682 --> 01:30:29,841
I'm gonna die now, I think.

1138
01:30:31,815 --> 01:30:33,213
Oh, Ken!

1139
01:30:35,182 --> 01:30:36,341
Jesus!

1140
01:32:43,982 --> 01:32:45,398
Mr. Blakely said you had left.

1141
01:32:45,498 --> 01:32:46,729
I need the key
to the room right now.

1142
01:32:46,829 --> 01:32:48,338
Quickly, now!

1143
01:32:49,215 --> 01:32:50,322
And you gotta
go home right now.

1144
01:32:50,348 --> 01:32:51,420
It's very, very
dangerous here.

1145
01:32:51,495 --> 01:32:53,085
- All right? Go home! Right now!
- Okay.

1146
01:33:37,715 --> 01:33:39,719
No, I won't let you up there!

1147
01:33:39,745 --> 01:33:41,887
Put that gun away, right now!

1148
01:33:41,962 --> 01:33:43,628
Lady, get out of
my fucking way, please.

1149
01:33:43,728 --> 01:33:47,006
No, I won't.
I won't get out of your way.

1150
01:33:47,681 --> 01:33:49,159
You'll have to go through me.

1151
01:33:49,259 --> 01:33:52,314
Well, obviously, I'm not gonna go through
you, am I, with a baby and that?

1152
01:33:52,363 --> 01:33:53,260
I'm a nice person.

1153
01:33:53,460 --> 01:33:56,275
But could you just get
out of the fucking way, please?

1154
01:34:01,315 --> 01:34:02,474
Marie!

1155
01:34:03,449 --> 01:34:05,763
Just let him come up, it's okay.

1156
01:34:05,863 --> 01:34:09,130
Harry, swear not to start
shooting until she's left the hotel.

1157
01:34:09,230 --> 01:34:12,597
I swear not to start shooting till she's
left the hotel. I totally swear.

1158
01:34:12,697 --> 01:34:15,131
Well, I'm not going anywhere.

1159
01:34:15,231 --> 01:34:17,362
This is my hotel.

1160
01:34:17,462 --> 01:34:19,210
So you can fuck off!

1161
01:34:31,848 --> 01:34:34,712
- I suppose you've got a gun up there?
- Yeah.

1162
01:34:35,915 --> 01:34:38,629
Then what are we gonna do?
We can't stand here all night.

1163
01:34:38,729 --> 01:34:41,760
Why don't you both put your
guns down and go home?

1164
01:34:41,860 --> 01:34:44,905
Don't be stupid.
This is the shootout.

1165
01:34:46,581 --> 01:34:49,660
- Harry, I've got an idea.
- What?

1166
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:51,962
My room faces onto the canal, right?

1167
01:34:52,062 --> 01:34:54,728
I'm gonna go back to me room,
jump into the canal,

1168
01:34:54,828 --> 01:34:56,894
see if I can swim to the other side
and escape.

1169
01:34:56,994 --> 01:34:59,196
Right. If you go outside
and round the corner,

1170
01:34:59,296 --> 01:35:01,630
you can shoot at me from there
and try and get me.

1171
01:35:01,730 --> 01:35:04,165
That way, we leave this lady and her
baby out of the whole, entire thing.

1172
01:35:04,265 --> 01:35:06,563
Do you completely promise
to jump into the canal?

1173
01:35:06,663 --> 01:35:08,430
I don't want to run out there,
come back in 10 minutes

1174
01:35:08,529 --> 01:35:10,060
and find you fucking
hiding in a cupboard.

1175
01:35:10,160 --> 01:35:11,430
I completely promise, Harry.

1176
01:35:11,529 --> 01:35:13,830
I'm not gonna risk having another
little kid die, am I?

1177
01:35:13,930 --> 01:35:18,062
So, hang on, I go outside,
then I go which way, right or left?

1178
01:35:18,162 --> 01:35:19,597
You go right, don't you?

1179
01:35:19,697 --> 01:35:22,659
You can see it from the doorway!
It's a big fucking canal!

1180
01:35:22,759 --> 01:35:25,698
All right. Jesus!
I've only just got here, haven't I?

1181
01:35:25,798 --> 01:35:28,596
Okay. On a count of
'one, two, three, go, ' okay?

1182
01:35:28,696 --> 01:35:29,840
Okay.

1183
01:35:35,748 --> 01:35:37,030
What? Who says it?

1184
01:35:37,130 --> 01:35:38,497
Oh, you say it.

1185
01:35:38,597 --> 01:35:40,497
You guys are crazy.

1186
01:35:40,597 --> 01:35:41,964
- Are you ready?
- Ready.

1187
01:35:42,064 --> 01:35:43,559
- Set?
- Set.

1188
01:35:43,659 --> 01:35:45,443
One, two, three, go!

1189
01:35:59,514 --> 01:36:00,980
Keep driving!

1190
01:36:08,015 --> 01:36:10,378
No way. You're way
too far away.

1191
01:38:12,982 --> 01:38:14,763
The little boy.

1192
01:38:14,863 --> 01:38:15,905
That's right, Ray.

1193
01:38:17,048 --> 01:38:18,604
The little boy.

1194
01:39:27,581 --> 01:39:28,774
I see.

1195
01:39:35,414 --> 01:39:37,040
No, Harry.

1196
01:39:38,048 --> 01:39:39,570
He's not...

1197
01:39:42,214 --> 01:39:44,840
You've got to stick to your principles.

1198
01:40:11,214 --> 01:40:12,969
<i>There's a Christmas tree
somewhere in London</i>

1199
01:40:13,062 --> 01:40:16,946
<i>with a bunch of presents
underneath it that'll never be opened.</i>

1200
01:40:17,581 --> 01:40:21,159
<i>And I thought, "If I survive all this,
I'll go to that house,</i>

1201
01:40:21,359 --> 01:40:23,395
<i>"apologize to the mother there,</i>

1202
01:40:23,495 --> 01:40:26,898
<i>"and accept whatever
punishment she chose for me..."</i>

1203
01:40:26,998 --> 01:40:30,345
<i>Prison, death,
it didn't matter.</i>

1204
01:40:31,681 --> 01:40:34,963
<i>Because at least in prison
and at least in death, you know,</i>

1205
01:40:35,063 --> 01:40:37,411
<i>I wouldn't be
in fucking Bruges.</i>

1206
01:40:39,881 --> 01:40:43,938
<i>But then, like a flash,
it came to me, and I realized,</i>

1207
01:40:46,247 --> 01:40:48,873
<i>"Fuck, man,
maybe that's what Hell is.</i>

1208
01:40:50,481 --> 01:40:53,777
<i>"The entire rest of eternity
spent in fucking Bruges!"</i>

1209
01:40:58,648 --> 01:41:01,478
<i>And I really, really
hoped I wouldn't die.</i>

1210
01:41:04,081 --> 01:41:07,172
<i>I really, really hoped I wouldn't die.</i>
