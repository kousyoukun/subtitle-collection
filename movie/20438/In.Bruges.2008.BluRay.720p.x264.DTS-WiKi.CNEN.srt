1
00:00:56,601 --> 00:01:00,701
我杀了人
就把枪丢进泰晤士河
RAY. ; After I killed them,
I dropped the gun
in the Thames,

2
00:01:00,701 --> 00:01:03,901
在汉堡王的厕所里把手洗干净
washed the residue
off me hands in the
bathroom of a Burger King,

3
00:01:03,901 --> 00:01:06,662
再走回家等指示
and walked home
to await instructions.

4
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:10,533
不久之后等到指示了
Shortly thereafter,
the instructions
came through.

5
00:01:11,235 --> 00:01:14,634
他妈的快滚出伦敦
"Get the fuck out of London,
youse dumb fucks.

6
00:01:14,634 --> 00:01:17,032
去布鲁日！
"Get to Bruges."

7
00:01:17,834 --> 00:01:20,392
我连布鲁日在哪儿都不知道
I didn't even know
where Bruges fucking was.

8
00:01:24,901 --> 00:01:27,129
是在比利时
It's in Belgium.

9
00:01:29,034 --> 00:01:30,168
杀手没有假期

10
00:01:30,168 --> 00:01:31,501
布鲁日是个烂地方
RAY. ; Bruges is a shithole.

11
00:01:31,501 --> 00:01:32,667
才不是咧
KEN. ; Bruges is
not a shithole.

12
00:01:32,667 --> 00:01:33,634
布鲁日是个烂地方
Bruges is a shithole.

13
00:01:33,634 --> 00:01:35,801
雷蒙，我们才刚下火车
Ray, we've only
just got off
the fucking train.

14
00:01:35,801 --> 00:01:38,868
能不能了以后再评论布鲁日?
Could we reserve judgment
on Bruges until we've seen
the fucking place?

15
00:01:38,868 --> 00:01:40,458
反正一定是个烂地方
I know it's gonna be
a shithole.

16
00:02:08,801 --> 00:02:10,267
烂地方
(SOFTLY) Shithole.

17
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:17,701
应该有人订两个房间
I think you have
a couple of rooms booked

18
00:02:17,701 --> 00:02:19,834
姓名是克伦汉和布雷克利
under Cranham and Blakely?

19
00:02:19,834 --> 00:02:23,101
对，但只有订一个房间
Yes. No, we have
one room booked.

20
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:23,667
不会吧
No

21
00:02:23,667 --> 00:02:25,301
一间双人房
One twin room.

订了两个礼拜
Booked for two weeks.

23
00:02:27,068 --> 00:02:28,863
两个礼拜?
Two weeks!

24
00:02:29,301 --> 00:02:30,335
还有没有房间?
Do you have
another room?

25
00:02:30,335 --> 00:02:33,400
客满了，因为圣诞节
No, I'm afraid
we're fully booked.

26
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,834
圣诞节到处都客满
With Christmas,
everywhere is fully booked.

27
00:02:35,834 --> 00:02:37,459
好吧
Okay.

28
00:02:42,335 --> 00:02:43,868
好漂亮
It's very pretty.

29
00:02:43,868 --> 00:02:45,501
我说真的，不能住这儿
I'm not being funny,
we can't stay here.

30
00:02:45,501 --> 00:02:47,467
等他打电话来再说
We've got to stay here
until he rings.

31
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:48,968
如果他两个礼拜都不打来呢?
Well, what if
he doesn't ring
for two weeks?

32
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:50,567
那就住两个礼拜啊
Then we stay here
for two weeks.

33
00:02:50,567 --> 00:02:51,934
住两个礼拜?
For two weeks?

34
00:02:51,934 --> 00:02:53,235
在布鲁日这个蠢地方?
In fucking Bruges?

35
00:02:53,235 --> 00:02:55,534
住这种房间?跟你?
In a room like this?With you?

36
00:02:55,534 --> 00:02:56,134
我才不要
No way!

37
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:59,001
雷蒙，我很不想这样讲
Ray, I really don't
like to say this...

38
00:02:59,001 --> 00:03:01,126
你不想怎样讲?
You really don't
like to say what?

39
00:03:01,367 --> 00:03:03,765
你知道的
Well... You know?

40
00:03:05,701 --> 00:03:07,758
不准你再提
Fucking bring that up.

41
00:03:44,001 --> 00:03:46,168
你觉得这很好吗?
Do you think
this is good?

42
00:03:46,168 --> 00:03:48,334
我觉得什么很好?
Do I think what's good?

43
00:03:48,334 --> 00:03:51,391
坐船四处游览
You know,
going round in a boat,
looking at stuff.

44
00:03:52,267 --> 00:03:54,961
很好啊
Yes, I do.

45
00:03:55,601 --> 00:03:57,658
这叫观光
It's called "sightseeing."

46
00:04:07,634 --> 00:04:09,429
你看
Oh, look at that.

47
00:04:12,501 --> 00:04:14,868
那里以前是医院
It's a former hospital.

48
00:04:14,868 --> 00:04:17,096
1100年代
From the 1100s.

49
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:20,634
布鲁日是全比利时
Bruges is the most
well-preserved
medieval town

50
00:04:20,634 --> 00:04:23,691
保存最好的中世纪城镇
in the whole of
Belgium, apparently.

51
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:47,367
你要不要上去?
Coming up?

52
00:04:47,367 --> 00:04:49,234
上面有什么?
What's up there?

53
00:04:49,234 --> 00:04:50,968
风景啊
The view.

54
00:04:50,968 --> 00:04:52,068
什么风景?
The view of what?

55
00:04:52,068 --> 00:04:54,767
下面的风景?在这里就看得到了
The view of down here?
I can see that from down here.

56
00:04:54,767 --> 00:04:59,101
雷蒙，你这个观光客很烂耶
Ray, you're about
the worst tourist
in the whole world.

57
00:04:59,101 --> 00:05:01,300
肯尼，我在都柏林长大
Ken, I grew up in Dublin.

58
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,667
我爱都柏林
I love Dublin.

59
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:05,434
如果我是在农场长大的智障
If I'd grown up on a farm
and was retarded,

60
00:05:05,434 --> 00:05:06,400
我可能会喜欢布鲁日
Bruges might impress me.

61
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,195
可惜我不是，所以不喜欢
But I didn't,
so it doesn't.

62
00:05:21,068 --> 00:05:23,034
我想把零钱用掉
Trying to get rid
of me coins.

63
00:05:23,267 --> 00:05:26,367
3块，3块50分，4块

68
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,689
4块90分

69
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,332
4块90分可以吗?
Will you take 4.90?

70
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:45,998
门票是5欧元
Entry is 5 euro.

71
00:05:46,868 --> 00:05:48,663
拜托，才差10分钱
Come on, man,
it's only 10 cents.

72
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,732
门票是5欧元
Entry is 5 euro.

73
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:03,467

00:06:03,467 --> 00:06:05,365
非常开心
Very happy.

75
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:42,562
我喜欢这里
I like it here.

76
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,701
去过塔顶吗?
MAN: Been to the top
of the tower?

77
00:07:12,701 --> 00:07:14,100
去过
Yeah. Yeah,

78
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,267
去过了，超烂
 it's rubbish.

79
00:07:16,267 --> 00:07:17,601
是吗?
It is? 

80
00:07:17,601 --> 00:07:20,267
旅游指南说非去不可
The guidebook says
it's a "must-see".

81
00:07:20,267 --> 00:07:22,968
你们不适合上去
Well, you lot
ain't going up there.

82
00:07:22,968 --> 00:07:24,667
是吗?怎么说?
Pardon me? Why?

83
00:07:24,667 --> 00:07:28,534
楼梯超多阶，你们别去比较好
I mean, it's all windy stairs.
I'm not being funny.

84
00:07:28,534 --> 00:07:31,295
你到底想说什么?
What exactly are you
trying to say?

85
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,968
我想说什么?
What exactly
am I trying to say?

86
00:07:33,968 --> 00:07:36,434
你们胖得跟大象一样
Youse are a bunch
of fucking elephants!

87
00:07:36,434 --> 00:07:37,832
你给我…
Right, you...

88
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,259
好了，算了啦，肥猪
Come on, leave it, fatty.

89
00:07:56,701 --> 00:07:58,701
你真没礼貌！
You know, you're just
the rudest man.

90
00:07:58,701 --> 00:08:00,599
太没礼貌了！
The rudest man!

91
00:08:01,868 --> 00:08:03,595
怎么回事?
What's all that about?

92
00:08:04,868 --> 00:08:06,100
他们不上去了
They're not going up there.

93
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,801
换作是我也不会上去
Hey, guys,
I wouldn't go up there.

94
00:08:08,801 --> 00:08:09,567
楼梯超窄的
It's really narrow.

95
00:08:09,567 --> 00:08:12,362
你这个王八蛋！
Screw you, motherfucker!

96
00:08:14,934 --> 00:08:17,126
是美国人吗?
Americans, isn't it?

97
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:24,767
这才像话嘛，渡假就要这样
Now, this is more like it.
Proper holidays.

98
00:08:24,767 --> 00:08:26,434
给我好朋友来杯好啤酒
One gay beer
for my gay friend,

99
00:08:26,434 --> 00:08:29,298
我普通的就好，因为我很普通
and one normal beer for me,
because I am normal.

100
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,701
这才叫人生
This is the life.

101
00:08:31,701 --> 00:08:34,064
住这里不是要喝酒的
We're not staying here
getting pissed.

102
00:08:34,701 --> 00:08:36,667
听他的话低调观光
We are quietly sightseeing,
like he says,

103
00:08:36,667 --> 00:08:39,334
等他打来指示下一步
and awaiting his call
to see what we do next.

104
00:08:39,334 --> 00:08:41,334
我觉得不如这样吧
This is my vote
on what we should do.

105
00:08:41,334 --> 00:08:42,667
再等一天
We give it another day,

106
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:44,601
顶多两天
two days, max.

107
00:08:44,601 --> 00:08:46,868
然后报纸如果还是没报导
Then we check
the papers again, and if
there's still nothing in them,

108
00:08:46,868 --> 00:08:48,267
我们就打给他说：
we phone him and say,

109
00:08:48,267 --> 00:08:50,400
哈利，多谢让我们来布鲁日
"Harry, thank you
for the trip to Bruges,

110
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,367
很开心，古迹很美
"it's been very nice,
all the old buildings
and that,

111
00:08:52,367 --> 00:08:54,434
但我们要回伦敦了
"but we're coming back
to London now, 

112
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:57,868
躲到不只有巧克力的乡下
and hide out
in a proper country,"where it isn't all just
fucking chocolates."

113
00:08:57,868 --> 00:08:59,434
我的建议是…
My vote would be

114
00:08:59,434 --> 00:09:02,167
听他的话低调观光
we quietly sightsee,
like he says,

115
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:05,258
等他打来指示下一步
and await his call
to see what we do next.

116
00:09:07,901 --> 00:09:10,833
甚至不知道是不是让我们来躲的
You don't even know
we're here hiding out.

117
00:09:12,467 --> 00:09:13,967
你在胡说什么?
What are you talking about?

118
00:09:13,967 --> 00:09:16,334
说不定我们有新任务
You don't even know
we're not here on a job.

119
00:09:16,334 --> 00:09:17,467
什么?新任务?
What, on a job?

120
00:09:17,467 --> 00:09:18,434
对
Yeah.

121
00:09:18,434 --> 00:09:19,100
在布鲁日?
Here in Bruges?

122
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:19,967
对
Yeah.

123
00:09:19,967 --> 00:09:21,501
来布鲁日出任务?
Here in Bruges, on a job?

124
00:09:21,501 --> 00:09:23,200
对
Yeah.

125
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,967
他到底说了什么?
Why? What did he
actually say?

126
00:09:24,967 --> 00:09:26,501
他什么也没说
He didn't actually
say anything.

127
00:09:26,501 --> 00:09:27,567
那你怎么会以为…
Then why do you think
it might be?

128
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,200
我没以为什么
I don't think anything.

129
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,300
但这也太刻意了吧
But it's a bit fucking
over-elaborate, isn't it?

130
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,367
带他去躲起来
"Go take him to hide out."

131
00:09:33,367 --> 00:09:34,967
带他去躲在哪里?
"Go take him to
hide out where?"

132
00:09:34,967 --> 00:09:38,127
他妈的带他躲在布鲁日
"Go take him to hide out
in fucking Bruges."

133
00:09:39,367 --> 00:09:41,595
可以躲在克洛顿啊
You can hide out
in Croydon.

134
00:09:44,967 --> 00:09:47,126
科芬特里也可以
Or Coventry.

135
00:09:51,933 --> 00:09:54,832
这样是有点太刻意了
It is a bit
over-elaborate.

136
00:09:58,434 --> 00:09:59,834
但我们又没枪
But we haven't
got any guns.

137
00:09:59,834 --> 00:10:02,231
哈利在哪儿都弄得到枪
Harry can get guns anywhere.

138
00:10:24,367 --> 00:10:26,799
他今晚不会打来了
He's not gonna ring tonight.

139
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,995
他今晚不会打来了吧！
He's not gonna ring tonight.

140
00:10:36,933 --> 00:10:38,467
我们出去
Let's go out.

141
00:10:38,467 --> 00:10:39,534
去哪儿?
Go out where?

142
00:10:39,534 --> 00:10:40,567
酒吧
The pub.

143
00:10:40,567 --> 00:10:42,089
不要
No!

144
00:10:59,933 --> 00:11:04,567
我们出去看看那些中世纪建筑
Let's go out
and have a look
at some of the All the old medieval
buildings and that.

145
00:11:04,567 --> 00:11:07,795
晚上点了灯一定更漂亮
Because I bet they look
even better at night,
all lit up.

146
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:14,223
搞定！
Yes!

147
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:25,892
那是格鲁修斯博物馆
That there is called
the Gruuthuse Museum.

148
00:11:26,334 --> 00:11:28,434
名字都好奇怪
They all have
funny names,
don't they?

149
00:11:28,434 --> 00:11:30,696
对，法兰德斯语
Yes, Flemish.

150
00:11:31,267 --> 00:11:32,000
这上面写：
In here it says,

151
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,767
比利时两度庇护被追杀的英王
"The Belgians twice sheltered
fugitive English Kings

152
00:11:34,767 --> 00:11:36,867
1471年和1651年
"from being murdered,
1471 and 1651."

153
00:11:36,867 --> 00:11:39,400
我讨厌历史，你不会吗?
I used to hate history,
didn't you?

154
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,767
都是发生过的事啊
It's all just a load of stuff
that's already happened.

155
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:43,255
那边在干嘛?
What are they
doing over there?

156
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:44,933
好像拍什么
They're filming something.

157
00:11:44,933 --> 00:11:46,627
他们在拍侏儒
They're filming midgets!

158
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,091
雷蒙！
Ray!

159
00:11:51,767 --> 00:11:55,892
这一幕你要像小老鼠走来走去
MAN: So, on this scene,
you're supposed to walk like
a little, tiny mouse, yeah?

160
00:11:59,601 --> 00:12:01,692
可以吗?很好
Okay? Great.

161
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,133
雷蒙，我们走啦
Ray, come on, let's go.

162
00:12:06,133 --> 00:12:08,860
干嘛走?他们在拍侏儒耶
My arse, "Let's go."
They're filming midgets.

163
00:12:10,501 --> 00:12:13,967
天哪！你看那个美眉
Oh, my God!
Look at that girl.

164
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:15,300
超正的
She's gorgeous!

165
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,501
雷蒙，走了啦
Ray, we're going
right now.

166
00:12:16,501 --> 00:12:18,100
门儿都没有
Fuck off, are we!

167
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,067
我来布鲁日没这么兴奋过
This is the best bit
of Bruges so far.

168
00:12:20,067 --> 00:12:21,658
你只会看古迹
You and your buildings.

169
00:12:46,601 --> 00:12:47,827
你好
Hello.

170
00:12:50,501 --> 00:12:51,830
你会讲英语吗?
Do you speak English?

171
00:12:52,501 --> 00:12:53,833
不会
No.

172
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,701
你会啦
Yes, you do.

173
00:12:55,701 --> 00:12:57,234
大家都会
Everybody does.

174
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:59,200
你们干嘛拍侏儒?
What are you
filming midgets for?

175
00:12:59,766 --> 00:13:01,100
这是荷兰片
It's a Dutch movie.

176
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:04,300
这场戏是在梦中
It's a dream sequence.

177
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,534
抄袭名导罗吉的威尼斯痴魂
It's a pastiche of
Nicholas Roeg's Don't Look Now.

178
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:07,534
不是抄袭，而是…
Not a pastiche, but a...

179
00:13:07,534 --> 00:13:12,267
说是向他致意又太夸张了
A"homage" is too strong.

180
00:13:12,267 --> 00:13:14,631
只是表示赞同啦
A"nod of the head"?

181
00:13:15,667 --> 00:13:17,996
你的英语讲得真好
Wow, your English
is very good.

182
00:13:22,467 --> 00:13:24,626
很多侏儒都是自杀的
A lot of midgets
tend to kill themselves.

183
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:30,289
在比例上算高的啦
A disproportionate amount.

184
00:13:30,733 --> 00:13:34,166
比如奇幻岛，，的赫夫维勒柴
Herve Villechaize,
off of Fantasy Island.

185
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,364
危险地带，，好像也有
I think somebody
off The Time Bandits.

186
00:13:37,867 --> 00:13:39,967
他们一定都是…
I suppose they must

187
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:42,434
因为个儿小…
get really sad about, like,

188
00:13:42,434 --> 00:13:44,234
…觉得很难过
being really
little and that.

189
00:13:44,234 --> 00:13:46,933
别人的眼光，大家都嘲笑他们
People looking at them
and laughing at them.

190
00:13:46,933 --> 00:13:48,263
辱骂他们
Calling them names.

191
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,729
骂他们矮冬瓜
You know, "shortarse."

192
00:13:51,933 --> 00:13:53,800
还有一个侏儒很有名
There's another famous

193
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,789
刚才没讲到，但我想不起来
midget I'm missing,
but I can't remember.

194
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,567
不是星际大战，，的R2D2
It's not the R2-D2 man.

195
00:13:58,567 --> 00:14:00,192
不，他还活着
No, he's still going.

196
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,267
希望你的侏儒不会自杀
I hope your midget
doesn't kill himself. 

197
00:14:03,267 --> 00:14:04,823
不然就拍不成了
Your
dream sequence will be fucked.

198
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,267
他不喜欢人家叫他侏儒
He doesn't like
being called a midget.

199
00:14:08,267 --> 00:14:09,200
叫他小不点比较好
He prefers "dwarf."

200
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,927
这就是我的重点
Well, this is
exactly my point!

201
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:12,601
大家都叫你侏儒
People go around calling
you a midget 

202
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,430
你却要别人叫你小不点
when you
want to be called a dwarf.

203
00:14:14,867 --> 00:14:16,265
难怪会举枪自尽嘛
Of course you're
gonna blow your head off!

204
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,434
我叫雷蒙，你呢?
My name's Ray. What's yours?

205
00:14:21,434 --> 00:14:22,694
克洛伊
Chloe.

206
00:14:24,601 --> 00:14:26,400
你是怎么通过保全那一关的?
How did you get past
the security man?

207
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,332
通过保全那一关
Getting past security men,

208
00:14:28,633 --> 00:14:29,867
是我的工作
it's sort of my job.

209
00:14:29,867 --> 00:14:30,867
你是小偷?
You're a shoplifter?

210
00:14:30,867 --> 00:14:32,493
不是，我不是小偷
(CHUCKLES) No,
not a shoplifter.

211
00:14:33,167 --> 00:14:34,428
这笑话超冷的
It's a good joke, though.

212
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,127
不是
No.

213
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,000
明天陪我吃晚饭
I'll tell you 

214
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,966
我再跟你说我是做什么的
what I am
at dinner tomorrow night.

215
00:14:56,867 --> 00:14:58,197
干！
Fuck.

216
00:15:07,766 --> 00:15:09,595
(克洛伊维雷)

217
00:15:11,133 --> 00:15:12,792
他妈的有搞头了！
How fucking cool.

218
00:15:23,733 --> 00:15:25,501
布雷克利先生?
Mr. Blakely?

219
00:15:25,501 --> 00:15:27,300
不是，我是克伦汉
Yes. No, Mr. Cranham.

220
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,459
不对，我是布雷克利
No. Yes. Mr. Blakely. Yes.

221
00:15:32,267 --> 00:15:33,698
有人留话给你
You have a message.

222
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,558
干！
Shit!

223
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,167
第一：你们怎么不在
HARRY. ; Number one,
why aren't you in when

224
00:15:43,167 --> 00:15:44,600
他妈的我叫你们去的地方?
I fucking told you to be in?

225
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,534
第二：这家旅馆的电话
Number two, why doesn't
this hotel

226
00:15:46,534 --> 00:15:47,933
他妈的怎么不能留话?
 have phones
with fucking voicemail

227
00:15:47,933 --> 00:15:50,600
还得留话给他妈的柜台小姐?
and not I have to leave
messages with the
fucking receptionist?

228
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,334
第三：我明晚再打去
Number three, you better
fucking be in tomorrow night

229
00:15:52,334 --> 00:15:53,733
他妈的你们最好都在
when I fucking call again

230
00:15:53,733 --> 00:15:54,867
不然你们他妈的就死定了
or there'll be fucking
Hell to pay, 

231
00:15:54,867 --> 00:15:55,900
我正在他妈的警告你
I'm fucking
telling you. 

232
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,558
哈利
Harry.

233
00:15:59,367 --> 00:16:01,434
(我不是柜台小姐)

234
00:16:01,434 --> 00:16:04,501
(这是我和外子派崔斯合开的)

235
00:16:04,501 --> 00:16:05,489
(玛莉)

236
00:16:34,933 --> 00:16:37,229
他妈的请你关灯好吗?
Would you turn
the fucking light off!

237
00:16:37,733 --> 00:16:38,664
对不起
Sorry, Ken.

238
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,859
他妈的小声一点
Keep the fucking
noise down!

239
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,865
有人心情不好
Someone's in a mood.

240
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:01,833
你绝对猜不到的
(SOFTLY) You'll
never guess what.
Will you shut your

241
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:04,560
请你他妈的闭嘴，睡觉啦
fucking mouth, please,
and go to sleep?

242
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:06,192
对不起
Oh, sorry.

243
00:17:10,133 --> 00:17:12,429
我先拿掉隐形眼镜
Except I've gotta take me
contact lenses out.

244
00:17:20,267 --> 00:17:21,800
我总共…
Altogether,

245
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,493
喝了…

246

00:17:28,967 --> 00:17:29,990

6杯啤酒和7瓶
 Six pints of beer
and seven bottles.

250
00:17:33,434 --> 00:17:35,695
可是我没醉耶！
And you know what?
I'm not even pissed!

251
00:17:41,733 --> 00:17:43,131
你绝对猜不到的
You'll never guess what, Ken.

252
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:46,967
肯尼，保证你猜不到
Ken, you'll never guess what.

253
00:17:46,967 --> 00:17:48,067
什么?
What?

254
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,300
我明晚有约会

255
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,334
恭喜你啊

256
00:17:50,334 --> 00:17:51,500

00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,967
请你关灯好吗?
Can you turn

258
00:17:52,967 --> 00:17:53,933
才来布鲁日一天

262
00:18:19,234 --> 00:18:20,824

263
00:18:21,933 --> 00:18:23,194

left it is a bit of a...

266
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,061
他有点鸡巴…
Well, he's a bit of a...

267
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,422
讨人厌?
Cock?

268
00:18:37,167 --> 00:18:39,428
对，他有点讨人厌鸡巴
Yes. He's a bit of a cock.

00:18:59,933 --> 00:19:01,762
天哪，他嘴巴真脏
Jeez, he swears a lot,
doesn't he?

273
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,759
今晚不能出去
We're staying in tonight.

274

只要一个人留守就好了
Except only one of us
needs to stay in, really.

278

Uh-huh.

279
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,200
是谁要留守?
And which one of us
would that be, now, Ray?

280
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,766
你不是不喜欢布鲁日?
I thought you
didn't like Bruges.

281
00:19:28,766 --> 00:19:30,466
我不喜欢布鲁日，这是烂地方
I don't like Bruges,
it's a shithole.

282
00:19:30,466 --> 00:19:33,333
但我说过我有约会
But I did already say

283
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:36,033
和比利时电影业的比利时女孩
I had a date with
a Belgian lady in the Belgian film business,

284
00:19:36,033 --> 00:19:38,295
我跟你说过了
which I did already
say about before.

285
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:44,796
别惹麻烦就好了啦
Just don't get into
any fucking trouble.

286
00:19:45,733 --> 00:19:47,892
我们要低调一点
We're keeping a low profile.

287
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,300
今天早上
And this morning,

288
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,366
还有今天下午
and this afternoon,

289
00:19:52,366 --> 00:19:55,466
都要做我想做的事，懂吗?
we are doing
what I want to do.

290
00:19:55,466 --> 00:19:57,433
懂
Got it?
Of course.

291
00:19:57,433 --> 00:19:59,366
应该和文化有关吧
Which, I presume,
will involve culture.

292
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:03,133
要在文化和乐趣中找到平衡点
Oh, we shall strike a balance
between culture and fun.

293
00:20:03,133 --> 00:20:04,933
我相信这个平衡点
Somehow I believe, Ken,
that the balance

294
00:20:04,933 --> 00:20:07,831
是比较偏向文化
 shall tip
in the favor of culture.

295
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,533
就像一个胖子智障
Like a big, fat,
fucking retarded,

296
00:20:11,533 --> 00:20:14,167
黑人胖女生妞去坐翘翘板
fucking black girl

297
00:20:14,167 --> 00:20:16,394
另一边是…
on a seesaw, opposite

298
00:20:19,067 --> 00:20:20,692
…一个小矮人
a dwarf.

299
00:20:56,399 --> 00:20:59,133
雷蒙，我们是不是说好
(SOFTLY) Ray, did we
or did we not agree

300
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:00,833
只要我今晚让你去约会
that if I let you
go on your date tonight,

301
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:02,700
今天就做我想做的事?
we'd do the things
I wanted to do today?

302
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,566
今天要做你想做的事
We are doing the things
that you wanted to do today.

303
00:21:04,566 --> 00:21:07,067
做的时后不准你耍性子
And that we'd do them
without you throwing
a fucking moody,

304
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:09,633
像糖果掉满地的5岁小孩
like some 5-year-old
who's dropped
all his sweets?

305
00:21:09,633 --> 00:21:11,031
我又没答应要这样
I didn't agree to that.

306
00:21:12,566 --> 00:21:14,123
我尽量配合啦
I'll cheer up.
I'll cheer up.

307
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,299
在那上面，祭台的最顶上
Up there,
the top altar,

308
00:21:17,299 --> 00:21:18,900
有个小玻璃瓶
is a phial

309
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,299
参加圣战的法兰德斯骑士
brought back by
a Flemish knight 

310
00:21:22,299 --> 00:21:23,733
从圣地带回来的
from the
Crusades in the Holy Land.

311
00:21:23,733 --> 00:21:24,967
那个玻璃瓶…
And that phial,

312
00:21:24,967 --> 00:21:26,600
你知道里面是什么吗?
do you know what
it's said to contain?

313
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,566
不知道，是什么?
No, what's it
said to contain?

314
00:21:27,566 --> 00:21:30,500
据说是耶稣基督的血
It's said to contain
some drops of
Jesus Christ's blood.

315
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,766
对，这间教堂就是因此而得名
Yeah, that's how
this church got its name.

316
00:21:32,766 --> 00:21:34,399
圣血教堂
Basilica of the Holy Blood.

317
00:21:34,399 --> 00:21:35,266
是吗?
Yeah. Yeah.

318
00:21:35,266 --> 00:21:37,167
对，那里面的血…
And this blood, right,

319
00:21:37,167 --> 00:21:38,900
虽然干掉了
though it's dried blood,

320
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,967
多年来在不同的时间点
at different times
over many years, 

321
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:43,000
据说都又变回液态
they say
it turned back into liquid.

322
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,666
从干掉的血变回液态
Turned back into liquid
from dried blood.

323
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:48,359
在不同的…
At various times of great

324
00:21:49,366 --> 00:21:50,733
…危机时刻
stress.

325
00:21:50,733 --> 00:21:51,500
是吗?
Yeah?
Yeah.

326
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,333
对，所以说…
So, yeah, 

327
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:56,731
我要去排队摸了，你也一起去
I'm gonna go up
in the queue and touch it,
which is what you do.

328
00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:58,067
是吗?
Yeah?

329
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:00,366
对，你要来吗?
Yeah. You coming?

330
00:22:00,366 --> 00:22:01,696
非去不可吗?
Do I have to?

331
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,864
非去不可吗?
Do you have to?

332
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,466
当然不一定
Of course you
don't have to.

333
00:22:06,466 --> 00:22:08,533
那是他妈的耶稣的血
It's Jesus' fucking blood,
isn't it? 

334
00:22:08,533 --> 00:22:10,333
你他妈的当然不一定要摸
Of course you
don't fucking have to!

335
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:12,424
你他妈的当然不一定要摸啦！
Of course you don't
fucking have to!

336
00:22:56,766 --> 00:22:58,857
你这个死小子
You little fucking cunt.

337
00:23:31,633 --> 00:23:34,031
我杀了人，神父
RAY. ; Murder, Father.

338
00:23:35,099 --> 00:23:36,656
雷蒙，你为什么杀人?
PRIEST. ; Why did you
murder someone, Raymond?

339
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,366
为了钱，神父
For money, Father.

340
00:23:41,366 --> 00:23:42,491
为了钱?
For money?

341
00:23:43,967 --> 00:23:46,000
你为钱杀人?
You murdered
someone for money?

342
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
是的
Yes, Father.

343
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,433
不是因为生气，没别的原因
Not out of anger,
not out of nothing.

344
00:23:49,433 --> 00:23:50,660
就是为了钱
For money.

345
00:23:52,433 --> 00:23:55,025
雷蒙，你为钱杀谁?
Who did you murder
for money, Raymond?

346
00:23:56,266 --> 00:23:57,664
杀你，神父
You, Father.

347
00:23:59,766 --> 00:24:00,867
你说什么?
I'm sorry?

348
00:24:00,867 --> 00:24:02,233
我说我要杀你，神父
I said you, Father.

349
00:24:02,233 --> 00:24:04,033
你聋了吗?
What, are you deaf?

350
00:24:04,033 --> 00:24:05,692
哈利华特斯要我问后你
Harry Waters says hello.

351
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,891
小男孩
The little boy.

352
00:24:55,733 --> 00:24:56,766
(1.耍任性)

353
00:24:56,766 --> 00:24:57,900
(2.数学考不好)

354
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:58,888
(3.伤心)

355
00:26:11,399 --> 00:26:12,955
这我满喜欢的
RAY: I quite like this one.

356
00:26:13,733 --> 00:26:15,533
其他都很不协调
All the rest were
rubbish by spastics,

357
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:17,089
但这幅画得好
but this one's quite good.

358
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,331
内容是什么?
What's that
all about, then?

359
00:26:21,099 --> 00:26:23,800
这是最后审判日
It's Judgment Day,
you know?

360
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,265
是喔
Oh, yeah.

361
00:26:27,999 --> 00:26:29,226
那又是什么?
What's that then?

362
00:26:30,466 --> 00:26:33,796
就是人间的最后一天
Well, it's, you know,
the final day on Earth.

363
00:26:34,533 --> 00:26:37,399
人类犯的罪都要被审判
When mankind will be
judged for all the crimes

364
00:26:37,399 --> 00:26:40,932
诸如此类的事
they've committed and that.

365
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:44,733
看看谁能上天堂谁能下地狱?
And see who gets
into Heaven and who gets
into Hell and all that?

366
00:26:44,733 --> 00:26:45,566
对
Yeah.

367
00:26:45,566 --> 00:26:47,399
另一个地方是什么?
And what's the other place?

368
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:48,800
炼狱
Purgatory.

369
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,390
炼狱
Purgatory?

370
00:26:50,932 --> 00:26:54,199
炼狱是个折衷的地方
Purgatory's kind of like
the in-betweeny one.

371
00:26:54,199 --> 00:26:58,154
给不太烂也不太好的人去的
You weren't really shit,
but you weren't
all that great, either.

372
00:26:58,899 --> 00:27:00,490
像塔腾汉一样
Like Tottenham.

373
00:27:01,299 --> 00:27:03,060
你相信那些?
Do you believe
in all that stuff, Ken?

374
00:27:03,867 --> 00:27:05,466
塔腾汉?
About Tottenham?

375
00:27:05,466 --> 00:27:08,364
最后审判日和来生
The Last Judgment
and the afterlife.

376
00:27:10,733 --> 00:27:12,198
还有罪恶感
Guilt and 

377
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:14,093
原罪
sins and

378
00:27:15,399 --> 00:27:16,864
地狱
Hell and 

379
00:27:17,566 --> 00:27:18,793
那些事?
all that?

380
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:29,824
我不知道，雷蒙
Um...

381
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,595
我不知道我相信什么
KEN: I don't know, Ray.
I don't know what I believe.

382
00:27:36,266 --> 00:27:39,061
你小时后学的事就根深蒂固了
The things you're
taught as a child, they never
really leave you, do they?

383
00:27:39,666 --> 00:27:42,032
比如我相信好好过日子
So, like,
I believe in trying
to lead a good life.

384
00:27:42,032 --> 00:27:44,498
比如老太太买完东西要回家
Like, if there's an old lady,
carrying her shopping home,

385
00:27:45,899 --> 00:27:48,922
我不会帮她提东西
I don't try and help her
carry her shopping,
I don't go that far,

386
00:27:49,633 --> 00:27:50,766
我不会做到那样
but I'll certainly hold the

387
00:27:50,766 --> 00:27:52,399
我是会替她开门啦
door open for her and that,

388
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:53,899
让她先出去
and let her go out before me.

389
00:27:53,899 --> 00:27:56,199
对，就算你想帮她提东西
Yeah. And anyway,
if you tried to help her
carry her shopping,

390
00:27:56,199 --> 00:27:57,832
她可能只会以为你想抢劫她
she'd probably think
you were just trying
to nick her shopping.

391
00:27:57,832 --> 00:27:58,500
没错
Exactly.

392
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,090
这就是现今的社会
This is the world
we live in today.

393
00:28:00,899 --> 00:28:02,566
同时…
At the same time

394
00:28:02,566 --> 00:28:05,633
在好好过日子的同时
as trying to lead
a good life,

395
00:28:05,633 --> 00:28:09,360
我要认命我杀了人
I have to reconcile myself
with the fact that, yes,
I have killed people.

396
00:28:10,899 --> 00:28:12,366
没有很多人啦
Not many people.

397
00:28:12,366 --> 00:28:14,298
大部分都不是什么好人
Most of them were
not very nice people.

398
00:28:15,233 --> 00:28:17,299
有个人除外
Apart from one person.

399
00:28:17,299 --> 00:28:18,766
是谁?
Who's that?

400
00:28:18,766 --> 00:28:21,132
丹尼亚利班的哥哥
This fellow,
Danny Aliband's brother.

401
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:22,792
他只是想保护他弟弟
He was just trying
to protect his brother.

402
00:28:23,366 --> 00:28:26,025
跟你我一样，他只是个导护老师
Like you or I would.He was just a lollipop man.

403
00:28:27,099 --> 00:28:29,333
他拿着酒瓶向我走过来
He came at me with a bottle.

404
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:31,663
你会怎样?我毙了他
What are you gonna do?I shot him down.

405
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:35,399
可是我觉得…
In my book, though,

406
00:28:35,399 --> 00:28:37,999
抱歉，有人拿酒瓶向你走过来
sorry, someone comes
at you with a bottle,

407
00:28:37,999 --> 00:28:40,333
那是致命的武器，后果他要自负
that is a deadly weapon,
he's gotta take
the consequences.

408
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:41,899
我心里有数
I know that in my heart.

409
00:28:41,899 --> 00:28:44,032
我也知道他只是想保护他弟弟
I also know that he was
just trying to protect
his brother, you know?

410
00:28:44,032 --> 00:28:46,633
我知道，但用酒瓶也可能杀了你
I know. But a bottle,
that can kill you.

411
00:28:46,633 --> 00:28:47,866
这是你死我活的问题
It's a case of
it's you or him.

412
00:28:47,866 --> 00:28:49,866
如果他赤手空拳就不一样了
If he'd come at you
with his bare hands,
that'd be different.

413
00:28:49,866 --> 00:28:50,932
那就不公平了
That wouldn't
have been fair.

414
00:28:50,932 --> 00:28:53,066
赤手空拳也能杀人
Well, technically,
your bare hands
can kill somebody, too.

415
00:28:53,066 --> 00:28:54,466
那也是致命武器
They can be
deadly weapons, too. 

416
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:56,166
说不定他会空手道
I mean,
what if he knew karate, say?

417
00:28:56,166 --> 00:28:57,600
你说过他是导护老师
You said he was
a lollipop man.

418
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,065
他是导护老师
He was a lollipop man.

419
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:01,666
导护老师会什么空手道?
What's a lollipop man doing
knowing fucking karate?

420
00:29:01,666 --> 00:29:02,899
我只是随便说说
I'm just saying.

421
00:29:02,899 --> 00:29:04,024
他几岁?
How old was he?
About 50.

422
00:29:04,866 --> 00:29:05,566
50岁上下
What's a 50-year-old

423
00:29:05,566 --> 00:29:08,132
50岁的导护老师会啥空手道?
lollipop man doing
knowing fucking karate?

424
00:29:08,132 --> 00:29:10,333
难道是中国来的导护老师?
What was he,
a Chinese lollipop man?

425
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:12,132
拜托
Jesus, Ken,

426
00:29:12,132 --> 00:29:14,394
我想说的是…
I'm trying to
talk about...

427
00:29:21,932 --> 00:29:23,832
我知道你想说什么
I know what you're
trying to talk about.

428
00:29:23,832 --> 00:29:25,466
我杀了一个小男孩
I killed a little boy.

429
00:29:25,466 --> 00:29:27,266
你还一直提导护老师
You keep bringing up
fucking lollipop men!

430
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:29,032
你不是故意杀小男孩的
You didn't mean
to kill a little boy.

431
00:29:29,032 --> 00:29:31,191
我知道我不是故意的
I know I didn't mean to.

432
00:29:32,932 --> 00:29:34,694
但因为我作的抉择
But because of the choices I made and the course
that 

433
00:29:35,366 --> 00:29:38,999
我做的事让一个小男孩不在了
I put into action,a little boy
isn't here anymore.

434
00:29:38,999 --> 00:29:40,726
他再也不会回来
And he'll never
be here again.

435
00:29:45,832 --> 00:29:47,957
不会回到这个世上，不是比利时
I mean here in the world,
not here in Belgium.

436
00:29:50,533 --> 00:29:52,333
反正他也不可能来比利时了
Well, he'll never be
here in Belgium,
either, will he?

437
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:54,492
说不定他长大会想来这里
I mean, he might have
wanted to come here
when he got older.

438
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,760
我不知道为什么
I don't know why.

439
00:29:58,932 --> 00:30:00,660
都是我害的
And that's all because of me.

440
00:30:02,966 --> 00:30:04,660
他是因我而死
He's dead because of me.

441
00:30:05,233 --> 00:30:07,399
我想…
And I'm trying to...

442
00:30:07,399 --> 00:30:09,592
我想释怀，但我做不到
I'm trying to
get me head around it,
but I can't.

443
00:30:11,732 --> 00:30:13,631
我杀了那个小男孩是事实
I will always have
killed that little boy.

444
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:17,796
永远也忘不了
That ain't ever
going away. 

445
00:30:18,266 --> 00:30:19,596
永远忘不了
Ever.

446
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:21,864
除非…
Unless...

447
00:30:23,099 --> 00:30:24,860
我自我了断
Maybe I go away.

448
00:30:29,433 --> 00:30:31,296
别乱想啦
Don't even think like that.

449
00:31:27,066 --> 00:31:28,622
你很帅
You look good.

450
00:31:33,132 --> 00:31:34,961
有个屁用?
What's it matter anyway?

451
00:32:00,233 --> 00:32:01,866
雷蒙，你是做什么的?
So, what do you do, Raymond?

452
00:32:01,866 --> 00:32:03,632
我…
I 

453
00:32:03,632 --> 00:32:05,292
为了钱杀人
shoot people for money.

454
00:32:07,665 --> 00:32:09,433
怎样的人?
What kinds of people?

455
00:32:09,433 --> 00:32:12,832
神父，小孩，还不就那样
Priests. Children.
You know, the usual.

456
00:32:12,832 --> 00:32:14,866
做那一行能赚很多钱吗?
Is there a lot of money
to be made in that
line of business?

457
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:16,966
杀神父可以，杀小孩就没钱赚
There is in priests.
There isn't in children.

458
00:32:16,966 --> 00:32:18,266
克洛伊，你是做什么的?
So what is it
you do, Chloe?

459
00:32:18,266 --> 00:32:21,832
卖可卡因和海洛因给比利时剧组
I sell cocaine and heroin
to Belgian film crews.

460
00:32:21,832 --> 00:32:23,298
真的吗?
Do you?

461
00:32:25,632 --> 00:32:27,962
我看起来像吗?
Do I look like I do?

462
00:32:28,966 --> 00:32:30,523
其实满像的
You do, actually.

463
00:32:33,732 --> 00:32:37,732
我看起来像会杀人吗?
Do I look like
I shoot people?

464
00:32:37,732 --> 00:32:39,789
不像
No.

465
00:32:40,699 --> 00:32:42,529
只会杀小孩啦
Just children.

466
00:32:49,765 --> 00:32:51,565
我今天看到你那个侏儒
I saw your midget today.

467
00:32:51,565 --> 00:32:53,333
那个混蛋连个招呼都不打
Little prick didn't
even say hello.

468
00:32:53,333 --> 00:32:55,166
他吃太多K他命了
Well, he's on
a lot of ketamine.

469
00:32:55,166 --> 00:32:56,063
那是什么?
What's that?

470
00:32:58,266 --> 00:32:59,899
马的镇静剂
Horse tranquilizer.

471
00:32:59,899 --> 00:33:00,990
马的镇静剂?
A horse tranquilizer?

472
00:33:01,399 --> 00:33:02,266
他哪来的?
Where'd he get that?

473
00:33:02,266 --> 00:33:03,899
我卖给他的
I sold it to him.

474
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:06,797
不能卖马的镇静剂给侏儒啦
You can't sell
horse tranquilizers
to a midget!

475
00:33:10,299 --> 00:33:12,565
我觉得这会是一部好电影
This movie,
I think it's gonna be
a very good one.

476
00:33:12,565 --> 00:33:14,966
到现在才有在布鲁日拍的好电影
There's never been
a classic movie made
in Bruges until now.

477
00:33:14,966 --> 00:33:16,765
想也知道没有，这是个烂地方
Of course there hasn't,
it's a shithole.

478
00:33:16,765 --> 00:33:18,099
布鲁日是我的家乡
Bruges is my hometown, Ray.

479
00:33:18,099 --> 00:33:19,466
还是烂地方啊
Well, it's still a shithole.

480
00:33:19,466 --> 00:33:20,532
才不是烂地方
It's not a shithole.

481
00:33:20,532 --> 00:33:23,132
怎样?连侏儒都要嗑药才待得住
What? Even midgets have to
take drugs to stick it.

482
00:33:23,132 --> 00:33:24,495
好吧
Okay.

483
00:33:25,899 --> 00:33:27,999
那…
So, 

484
00:33:27,999 --> 00:33:29,521
你侮辱了我的家乡
you've insulted
my hometown.

485
00:33:30,099 --> 00:33:32,699
你表现得很好
You're doing
very well, Raymond.

486
00:33:32,699 --> 00:33:35,066
顺便讲几个比利时笑话给我听吧
Why don't you tell me
some Belgian jokes
while you're at it?

487
00:33:35,066 --> 00:33:36,699
我不知道比利时笑话
I don't know
any Belgian jokes.

488
00:33:36,699 --> 00:33:39,563
就算我知道也不会笨到…
And if I did,
I think I'd have
the good sense not to...

489
00:33:40,166 --> 00:33:41,132
等一下
Hey, hang on. 

490
00:33:41,132 --> 00:33:43,825
比利时最近很多虐杀小孩事件?
Is Belgium
where there were all those
child abuse murders lately?

491
00:33:44,866 --> 00:33:46,491
那我知道比利时笑话了
Then I do know
a Belgian joke.

492
00:33:49,266 --> 00:33:51,027
比利时以什么闻名?
What's Belgium famous for?

493
00:33:52,066 --> 00:33:53,266
巧克力和虐童
Chocolates and child abuse.

494
00:33:53,266 --> 00:33:56,198
发明巧克力只是为了引诱小孩
And they only invented
the chocolates to
get to the kids.

495
00:33:58,132 --> 00:33:59,765
干嘛?
What?

496
00:33:59,765 --> 00:34:02,391
有个被虐杀的女孩是我的朋友
One of the girls
they murdered was
a friend of mine.

497
00:34:12,866 --> 00:34:14,332
对不起
I'm sorry, Chloe.

498
00:34:23,966 --> 00:34:26,431
那个被虐杀的女孩不是我朋友啦
One of the girls
they murdered wasn't
a friend of mine.

499
00:34:27,132 --> 00:34:29,098
我只是想看你难过
I just wanted to
make you feel bad.

500
00:34:29,999 --> 00:34:31,632
你上当了
And it worked.

501
00:34:31,632 --> 00:34:33,258
被我骗了
Quite well.

502
00:34:51,832 --> 00:34:53,196
真过分
Fucking unbelievable.

503
00:35:07,066 --> 00:35:08,732
什么事过分?
What's fucking
unbelievable?

504
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:10,221
你在跟我讲话吗?
Are you talking to me?

505
00:35:12,266 --> 00:35:15,499
他停顿了，虽然他超想揍人的
(SOFTLY) He pauses,
even though he should
just hit the cunt.

506
00:35:15,499 --> 00:35:16,899
他还回嘴咧
And he repeats.

507
00:35:16,899 --> 00:35:19,932
对，我就是在跟你说话
Yes, I am talking to you.

508
00:35:19,932 --> 00:35:21,565
什么事过分?
What's fucking unbelievable?

509
00:35:21,565 --> 00:35:23,532
告诉你什么事过分啦
Well, I'll tell you what's
fucking unbelievable, shall I?

510
00:35:23,532 --> 00:35:26,532
对着我和我女朋友的脸上吐烟
Blowing cigarette smoke
straight into myself
and my girlfriend's face.

511
00:35:26,532 --> 00:35:27,832
太过分了
That's fucking unbelievable!

512
00:35:27,832 --> 00:35:28,699
这里是吸烟区
This is the smoking section.

513
00:35:28,699 --> 00:35:31,032
我不管是不是吸烟区
I don't care if it's
the smoking section.

514
00:35:31,032 --> 00:35:34,233
她直接对着我脸上吐烟
All right?
She directed it
right in my face, man.

515
00:35:34,233 --> 00:35:36,499
我可不想被你的傲慢害死
I don't wanna die just because
of your fucking arrogance.
Uh-huh.

516
00:35:36,499 --> 00:35:38,931
越南人以前也这样讲
Isn't that what the
Vietnamese used to say?

517
00:35:39,532 --> 00:35:41,199
越南人?
Vietnamese?

518
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:43,032
干嘛扯到越南人?
 What are you
talking about, the Vietnamese?

519
00:35:43,032 --> 00:35:44,565
讲这种话根本不合逻辑
That statement makes
no fucking sense at all.

520
00:35:44,565 --> 00:35:46,599
很合逻辑啊，越南人
Yes it does.
The Vietnamese!

521
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:48,699
多讲几次也不会合逻辑
Well, saying it over
and over ain't gonna make
any more sense out of it.

522
00:35:48,699 --> 00:35:54,032
我和我女朋友吸你朋友的二手烟
How does the Vietnamese
have any relevance whatsoever to myself and my girlfriend
having to breathe

523
00:35:54,032 --> 00:35:56,532
关越南人什么事?
your friend's
cigarette smoke?

524
00:35:56,532 --> 00:35:57,896
告诉我…
Tell me how saying...

525
00:35:59,233 --> 00:36:01,994
我替约翰蓝侬扁你啦，死美国佬
That's for John Lennon,
you Yankee fucking cunt!

526
00:36:02,699 --> 00:36:03,732
酒瓶?
A bottle? 

527
00:36:03,732 --> 00:36:05,130
不用麻烦了
No, don't bother.

528
00:36:18,799 --> 00:36:20,265
对，我们要走了
We're leaving.

529
00:36:20,699 --> 00:36:22,199
我没打女人
I don't hit women!

530
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:24,256
我从来不打女人
I would never
hit a woman, Chloe!

531
00:36:24,866 --> 00:36:27,132
拿酒瓶想打我的女人例外
I'd hit a woman
who was trying to
hit me with a bottle!

532
00:36:27,132 --> 00:36:29,899
那不一样，那叫自卫
That's different.
That's self-defense,
isn't it?

533
00:36:29,899 --> 00:36:32,398
或是会空手道的女人
Or a woman
who could do karate.

534
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:34,432
大部分的女人我都不会打
I'd never hit
a woman generally, Chloe.

535
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,999
别误会了
Don't think that.

536
00:36:35,999 --> 00:36:37,692
天哪，你好漂亮
God, you're pretty.

537
00:36:39,966 --> 00:36:41,532
我要去打电话
I have to make a call.

538
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:42,966
不会吧
Oh, no.

539
00:36:42,966 --> 00:36:46,329
你不要我了，因为我打了女人
You've gone off me, now,
haven't you? Just because
I hit that fucking cow.

540
00:37:11,999 --> 00:37:12,799
喂?
Hello?

541
00:37:12,799 --> 00:37:14,765
你他妈的昨天去哪里?
HARRY. ; Where the fuck
were you yesterday?

542
00:37:15,632 --> 00:37:18,398
我们只是出去吃晚饭，才半小时
We just popped out for
some dinner, Harry. We only
popped out for half an hour.

543
00:37:18,398 --> 00:37:20,298
是吗?你们吃什么?
Yeah? What'd you have?

544
00:37:20,298 --> 00:37:20,799
晚饭吗?
For dinner?

545
00:37:20,799 --> 00:37:21,799
对
Yeah.

546
00:37:21,799 --> 00:37:23,332
披萨，去必胜客
Pizza, at Pizza Hut.

547
00:37:23,332 --> 00:37:24,632
好吃吗?
Was it nice?

548
00:37:24,632 --> 00:37:26,899
还不错，就是必胜客嘛
Yeah, it was all right.
I don't know.
It was Pizza Hut.

549
00:37:26,899 --> 00:37:27,966
跟英国一样
The same as in England.

550
00:37:27,966 --> 00:37:29,522
对，这就是国际全球化
Well, that's globalization,
isn't it? 

551
00:37:30,132 --> 00:37:31,495
雷蒙也在吗?
Is Ray
there with you?

552
00:37:32,499 --> 00:37:34,332
他在厕所
He's in the toilet.

553
00:37:34,332 --> 00:37:36,166
他听得见吗?
Can he hear?

554
00:37:36,166 --> 00:37:36,765
听不见
No.

555
00:37:36,765 --> 00:37:38,565
他在干嘛?
What's he doing?

556
00:37:38,565 --> 00:37:39,332
什么意思?
What do you mean?

557
00:37:39,332 --> 00:37:41,632
他在小号或大号?
Is he doing a wee or a poo?

558
00:37:41,632 --> 00:37:43,199
我不知道，哈利，门关着
I don't know, Harry,
the door's closed.

559
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:44,699
叫他出去办事半小时
Send him out on an errand
for half an hour, 

560
00:37:44,699 --> 00:37:46,665
但别让他起疑心
but don't
make it sound suspicious.

561
00:37:52,565 --> 00:37:55,360
雷蒙?你去酒吧半小时好吗?
Ray? Why don't you
go out down to the pub
for half an hour?

562
00:37:58,866 --> 00:38:01,832
对，我知道我说你不能去
Yeah, yeah, I know
I said you couldn't,

563
00:38:01,832 --> 00:38:03,821
但你去玩一下嘛
but might as well
enjoy ourselves, eh?

564
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:07,099
我不知道哪里能打保龄球
No, I don't know if
they've got bowling anywhere.

565
00:38:07,099 --> 00:38:08,496
你去问问看
Could have a look.

566
00:38:09,899 --> 00:38:11,330
好，再见
Yeah, see you.

567
00:38:22,565 --> 00:38:24,032
他走了
Yeah. He's gone.

568
00:38:24,032 --> 00:38:25,520
你跟他说什么?
What'd you say to him?

569
00:38:26,198 --> 00:38:28,765
我叫他去喝杯酒，出去透透气
I said, " Why don't you go
have a drink, you say
you've been cooped up?"

570
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:29,765
他怎么说?
What did he say?

571
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:30,966
他说好
Said, yeah, he would.

572
00:38:30,966 --> 00:38:33,132
他可能要去问哪里有保龄球馆
And he might go have
a look to see if there's
a bowling alley around.

573
00:38:33,132 --> 00:38:35,132
他刚才是在尿尿?
Was he just having a wee?

574
00:38:35,132 --> 00:38:36,999
大概吧，应该是
Yeah, I think so.
I assume so.

575
00:38:36,999 --> 00:38:38,232
所以他不介意?
Sure he didn't mind?

576
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:39,699
对，他早就想出去了
No, he was glad
to get out.

577
00:38:39,699 --> 00:38:41,066
他真的走了吗?
He's definitely gone?

578
00:38:41,066 --> 00:38:42,499
对，他甩上门了
Yeah, yeah,
he slammed the door.

579
00:38:42,499 --> 00:38:45,125
甩门不表示就走了，去门外看看
That don't mean he's gone.
Go check outside the door.

580
00:39:02,532 --> 00:39:04,398
哈利，他走了啦
Harry, he's definitely gone.

581
00:39:04,398 --> 00:39:06,732
你知不知道布鲁日没保龄球馆?
You realize there are no
bowling alleys in Bruges?

582
00:39:06,732 --> 00:39:09,332
我知道，他还是想去找
I realize that, Harry.
The boy wanted to
have a look anyway.

583
00:39:09,332 --> 00:39:11,832
难不成要盖中世纪保龄球馆?
What are they gonna have,
a medieval fucking
bowling alley?

584
00:39:11,832 --> 00:39:14,265
我说了他就是想出去嘛
As I say, I think
he was just glad
to get out and about.

585
00:39:14,265 --> 00:39:17,066
他看到运河开心吗?
So, is he having
a nice time, seeing
all the canals and that?

586
00:39:17,066 --> 00:39:19,532
我就很喜欢那里
I had a lovely time
when I was there.

587
00:39:19,532 --> 00:39:22,066
好多运河和古迹建筑
All the canals and the
old buildings and that.

588
00:39:22,066 --> 00:39:23,198
你几时来过?
When were you here?

589
00:39:23,198 --> 00:39:24,765
我7岁的时后
When I was seven.

590
00:39:24,765 --> 00:39:26,993
最后一次快乐的假期
Last happy holiday
I fucking had.

591
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:29,465
你们有去游运河吗?
Have you been on
a canal trip, yet?

592
00:39:29,465 --> 00:39:30,298
有
Yeah.

593
00:39:30,298 --> 00:39:32,499
有没有去走旧石头路?
Have you been down,
like, all the old
cobbled streets and that?

594
00:39:32,499 --> 00:39:33,432
有
Yeah.

595
00:39:33,432 --> 00:39:35,465
那里像童话故事一样吧?
It's like a fairytale,
isn't it, that place?

596
00:39:35,465 --> 00:39:35,899
对
Yeah.

597
00:39:35,899 --> 00:39:37,432
好多教堂，哥德式教堂
With the churches and that.
They're Gothic.

598
00:39:37,432 --> 00:39:37,866
对
Yeah.

599
00:39:37,866 --> 00:39:38,732
是哥德式吗?
Is it Gothic?

600
00:39:38,732 --> 00:39:39,499
对
Yeah.

601
00:39:39,499 --> 00:39:42,232
他玩得很开心?
So he's having
a really nice time?

602
00:39:42,232 --> 00:39:45,131
我是玩得很开心
Well, I'm having
a really nice time.

603
00:39:45,131 --> 00:39:48,256
我不确定他喜不喜欢
I'm not sure if it's
really his cup of tea.

604
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:52,432
什么?
What?

605
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:54,298
我不确定他喜不喜欢
You know, I'm not sure
if it's really his thing.

606
00:39:54,298 --> 00:39:55,899
怎么会不喜欢?
What do you mean,
"It's not really his thing"?

607
00:39:55,899 --> 00:39:58,131
他怎么可能不喜欢?
What's that supposed to mean,
"It's not really his thing"?

608
00:39:58,131 --> 00:39:59,732
这话他妈的是什么意思?
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

609
00:39:59,732 --> 00:40:00,765
没什么
Nothing, Harry.

610
00:40:00,765 --> 00:40:02,899
那里像他妈的童话故事一样
It's a fairytale
fucking town, isn't it?

611
00:40:02,899 --> 00:40:05,765
怎么会有人不喜欢童话故事?
How can a fairytale town
not be somebody's
fucking thing?

612
00:40:05,765 --> 00:40:08,966
运河，桥，石头路和教堂
How can all those canals
and bridges and cobbled
streets and those churches,

613
00:40:08,966 --> 00:40:11,032
他妈的美丽的童话故事城市
all that beautiful
fucking fairytale stuff,

614
00:40:11,032 --> 00:40:13,332
怎么会有人他妈的不喜欢?
how can that not be
somebody's fucking thing, eh?

615
00:40:13,332 --> 00:40:14,599
我想说的是…
What I think
I meant to say was...

616
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:15,966
那里还有天鹅吗?
Is the swan still there?
Yeah, the swan's...

617
00:40:15,966 --> 00:40:16,699
有，还有天鹅
How can fucking swans
not fucking 

618
00:40:16,699 --> 00:40:18,365
怎么会有人不喜欢天鹅?
be somebody's
fucking thing, eh?

619
00:40:18,365 --> 00:40:20,799
怎么可能?
How can that be?

620
00:40:20,799 --> 00:40:21,966
我想说的是…
What I think
I meant to say was,

621
00:40:21,966 --> 00:40:25,232
他刚来的时后不太喜欢
when he first arrived,
he wasn't quite sure about it.

622
00:40:25,232 --> 00:40:29,032
刚下火车有条4线道大马路
You know, there's that big,
dual carriageway when you
get off the train?

623
00:40:29,032 --> 00:40:31,632
你上次来的时后可能没有
It mightn't have been
here when you were
here last, Harry.

624
00:40:31,632 --> 00:40:34,732
但他一进到旧城区
Well, as soon as he got into,
like, the old town proper,

625
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:37,332
看到运河和桥梁
and he saw the canals
and the bridges and,

626
00:40:37,332 --> 00:40:40,699
还有天鹅，他就他妈的就爱上这里了
you know, the swans and that,well, he just
fucking loved it then.

627
00:40:40,699 --> 00:40:41,899
怎么看都不过瘾
Couldn't get enough of it,

628
00:40:41,899 --> 00:40:43,922
中世纪的古迹
the medieval part of town.

629
00:40:44,398 --> 00:40:45,765
只是…
It was just that initial,

630
00:40:45,765 --> 00:40:49,032
刚开始的大马路吓到他了
dual carriageway thing sort of
put him off for a second.

631
00:40:49,032 --> 00:40:50,765
我不记得有大马路
Don't know if I remember
a dual carriageway.

632
00:40:50,765 --> 00:40:52,131
是最近才有的吧
Must be recent.

633
00:40:52,131 --> 00:40:53,599
没扫兴吧?
Hasn't spoilt it, has it?

634
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:55,565
没有…
No, no, no,

635
00:40:55,565 --> 00:40:57,963
只是刚开始而已
it's just that
initial thing.

636
00:40:59,265 --> 00:41:01,731
你知道吗?
And you know what?

637
00:41:02,165 --> 00:41:04,365
我们走在街道上
As we were walking
through the streets,

638
00:41:04,365 --> 00:41:06,765
还有…
there was 

639
00:41:06,765 --> 00:41:10,131
冰冷的薄雾笼罩着建筑物
this sort of
freezing fog hanging
over everything,

640
00:41:10,131 --> 00:41:14,165
看起来更像童话故事了
and it made it
look almost like
a fairytale or something.

641
00:41:14,165 --> 00:41:15,465
你知道他跟我说什么吗?
And he turned to me,
do you know what he said?

642
00:41:15,465 --> 00:41:17,131
他说什么?
What'd he say?

643
00:41:17,131 --> 00:41:20,765
他说：肯尼，我知道我醒着
He said, " Ken, I know
I'm awake, 

644
00:41:20,765 --> 00:41:22,398
但我觉得好像在作梦
but I feel
like I'm in a dream."

645
00:41:22,398 --> 00:41:24,732
是吗?他那样讲?
Yeah? He said that?

646
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:25,599
对
Yeah.

647
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:28,465
应该是美梦吧?
Meaning, like,
in a good dream?

648
00:41:28,465 --> 00:41:31,265
对，当然是美梦
Yeah. Of course,
like in a good dream.

649
00:41:31,265 --> 00:41:33,332
那就好
Oh, good. 

650
00:41:33,332 --> 00:41:34,832
很高兴他喜欢那里
I'm glad he likes it there.

651
00:41:34,832 --> 00:41:36,832
幸好我们还能让他开心
I'm glad we were able
to give him something.

652
00:41:36,832 --> 00:41:40,320
给他好印象，他毕竟不是坏孩子
Something good and happy.
Because he wasn't
a bad kid, was he?

653
00:41:43,532 --> 00:41:46,396
他不是坏孩子吧?
He wasn't a bad kid,
was he?

654
00:41:46,998 --> 00:41:48,699
记下这个地址
Listen, take down
this address.

655
00:41:48,699 --> 00:41:50,065
朗斯察17号
Raamstraat 17.

656
00:41:50,065 --> 00:41:52,997
是“朗，，，不是”郎
That's "Raam," like "Ram,"
but with an extra "a."

657
00:41:54,031 --> 00:41:55,165
朗斯察17号
Raamstraat 17.

658
00:41:55,165 --> 00:41:56,688
记好没?
You got that?

659
00:41:57,165 --> 00:41:58,799
好了，朗斯察17号
Yes, Raamstraat 17.

660
00:41:58,799 --> 00:42:01,432
好，明早9点会有人在那里等
Good. There'll be a man
there tomorrow morning
at 9.;00, 

661
00:42:01,432 --> 00:42:02,966
他叫尤利
his name's Yuri.

662
00:42:02,966 --> 00:42:03,532
尤利
Yuri.

663
00:42:03,532 --> 00:42:04,799
他会给你枪
He'll give you the gun.

664
00:42:04,799 --> 00:42:07,866
明天3，4点办完事以后
Ring me on the public phone
at Jimmy Driscoll's

665
00:42:07,866 --> 00:42:10,058
用公共电话打给我
about 3.;00 or 4.;00 tomorrow,
after it's done.

666
00:42:10,465 --> 00:42:12,761
办完什么事?
After what's done?

667
00:42:12,899 --> 00:42:15,228
你是笨蛋吗?
Are you being thick?

668
00:42:16,398 --> 00:42:17,198
不是
No.

669
00:42:17,198 --> 00:42:19,031
我喜欢雷蒙，他是个好人
Listen, I like Ray.
He was a good bloke,

670
00:42:19,031 --> 00:42:22,398
但他在办正事时误杀了一个小孩
but when it all comes
down to it, you know,he blew the head off
a little fucking kid.

671
00:42:22,398 --> 00:42:23,765
他是你介绍的
And you brought him in, Ken.

672
00:42:23,765 --> 00:42:27,458
你自己的烂摊子要自己收
So if the buck
don't stop with him,
where does it stop?

673
00:42:32,699 --> 00:42:34,631
肯尼?
Ken?

674
00:42:35,065 --> 00:42:37,432
你自己的烂摊子要自己收
If the buck
don't stop with him,
where does it stop?

675
00:42:37,432 --> 00:42:39,265
我会收的，超简单
It stops with me, Harry.
That's an easy one.

676
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:42,254
别生气，肯尼
Look, don't get shirty, Ken.

677
00:42:42,499 --> 00:42:47,298
很高兴能在他死前为他做点事
Listen, I'm just glad that
I was able to do something
for the boy before he went.

678
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:49,098
做什么事?
Do what for the boy?

679
00:42:49,098 --> 00:42:52,030
让他去看看布鲁日
You know, have him
get to see Bruges.

680
00:42:52,432 --> 00:42:55,887
我死前也想再看看布鲁日
I'd like to go to see
Bruges again before I die.

681
00:42:56,332 --> 00:43:00,355
他是怎么说的?好像在作梦?
What was it he said
again about... Yeah,
"It's like a dream."

682
00:43:01,765 --> 00:43:02,398
我知道我醒着
"I know I'm awake,

683
00:43:02,398 --> 00:43:04,830
但我觉得好像在作梦
but I feel like
I'm in a dream."

684
00:43:07,265 --> 00:43:09,424
对
Yeah.

685
00:43:10,298 --> 00:43:12,662
他死了再跟我说
Give me a call
when he's dead.

686
00:43:37,765 --> 00:43:40,432
她是我女朋友，王八蛋！
That's my fucking girlfriend,
you asshole.

687
00:43:40,432 --> 00:43:41,465
艾瑞克，你在干嘛?
Eirik, what are you doing?

688
00:43:41,465 --> 00:43:43,298
你打哪儿来的?
Where are you from, fucker?

689
00:43:43,298 --> 00:43:45,632
我是爱尔兰人
Ireland, originally.

690
00:43:45,632 --> 00:43:49,866
你跑来比利时搞别人的女朋友?
And you think it's okay
to come over to Belgium and fuck another man's girl?

691
00:43:49,866 --> 00:43:51,632
我不知道她有男朋友
Look, I didn't know
she had a boyfriend,
all right?

692
00:43:51,632 --> 00:43:53,198
我也没搞她，不信你问她
And I haven't fucked her,
anyway. Ask her.

693
00:43:53,198 --> 00:43:54,599
我只用手摸而已
I'd only put me hand on it.

694
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:56,656
艾瑞克，把枪放下！
Eirik, put the gun down!

695
00:43:57,799 --> 00:44:00,265
跪下来把嘴张开
Get down on your knees
and open your mouth.

696
00:44:00,265 --> 00:44:01,931
别做傻事啊
Don't start being silly.

697
00:44:01,931 --> 00:44:03,830
给我跪下…
Get down on your...

698
00:44:04,665 --> 00:44:08,565
小混混怎么突然都变得这么娘?
Exactly at what point
was it that all skinheads
suddenly became poofs?

699
00:44:08,565 --> 00:44:10,332
以前的小混混都去殴打
Used to be,
you were a skinhead,
you just went around
beating up

700
00:44:10,332 --> 00:44:13,332
12岁的巴基坦小孩
Pakistani 12-year-olds.

701
00:44:13,332 --> 00:44:15,423
现在却变得这么娘
Now it seems a prerequisite
to be a fucking bum-boy!

702
00:44:16,765 --> 00:44:18,065
拿刀也没用啦
That's not gonna
help you, man.

703
00:44:18,065 --> 00:44:20,827
雷蒙，那把枪里只有空包弹
Ray, there's only
blanks in that gun.

704
00:44:27,332 --> 00:44:29,198
艾瑞克，不要！
Eirik, don't!

705
00:44:29,198 --> 00:44:30,632
谁才娘啊！
Now who's the
fucking bum-boy?

706
00:44:30,632 --> 00:44:32,120
你这个他妈的臭娘们！
You, you fucking bum-boy!

707
00:44:34,931 --> 00:44:35,831
克洛伊?
Chloe, 

708
00:44:35,831 --> 00:44:37,065
这是怎么回事?
what exactly
is going on here?

709
00:44:37,065 --> 00:44:38,165
我看不见了
I can't see!

710
00:44:38,165 --> 00:44:39,098
我看不见了
I can't see!

711
00:44:39,098 --> 00:44:40,165
你当然看不见
Of course you can't
fucking see!

712
00:44:40,165 --> 00:44:42,495
我刚才用空包弹打你的眼睛
 I just shot
a blank in your fucking eyes!

713
00:44:43,565 --> 00:44:44,565
这个人是你男朋友?
Is this fella your boyfriend?

714
00:44:44,565 --> 00:44:46,065
不是
No.

715
00:44:46,065 --> 00:44:47,499
我是说…
 I mean,

716
00:44:47,499 --> 00:44:48,565
他以前是
 he used to be.

717
00:44:48,565 --> 00:44:49,632
他来这里干嘛?
Well, what's he doing here?

718
00:44:49,632 --> 00:44:51,732
我们…
We... 

719
00:44:51,732 --> 00:44:53,365
我们偶尔会抢观光客
We rob tourists,
sometimes.

720
00:44:53,365 --> 00:44:54,632
我就知道没这么好的事  他冲进来抓奸…
I fucking knew
it was too good
to be true!

721
00:44:56,565 --> 00:44:58,398
我就知道你不会跟我上床
I knew you'd have never
shagged me, normally.

722
00:44:58,398 --> 00:45:00,831
不是这样啦
No! That's not true, I...

723
00:45:00,831 --> 00:45:03,627
今晚我取消了，我叫他今晚别来
I called it off tonight.
I told him not
to come tonight.

724
00:45:04,165 --> 00:45:05,499
你今晚还来干嘛?
Why did you come tonight?

725
00:45:05,499 --> 00:45:06,965
克洛伊，我真的看不见了
EIRIK: Chloe,
I can't see,
I swear it!

726
00:45:06,965 --> 00:45:09,363
别再像娘们鬼叫了啦
Stop whingeing
like a big gay baby.

727
00:45:09,765 --> 00:45:11,432
我好几个月没打炮了
I haven't had
a shag in months!

728
00:45:11,432 --> 00:45:13,965
克洛伊，我这只眼睛看不见了
I can't see out of this eye,
Chloe! 

729
00:45:13,965 --> 00:45:16,227
我要去医院！
I have to go
to the hospital!

730
00:45:16,599 --> 00:45:18,165
我载你去
I'll drive you.

731
00:45:18,165 --> 00:45:20,065
好极了，坏了我的好事
Great! Now the whole
night's ruined!

732
00:45:20,065 --> 00:45:21,298
不！
No!

733
00:45:21,298 --> 00:45:23,093
你可以留下来
You can stay if you want.

734
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:25,398
只是不知道要弄多久
I just don't know
how long I'll be.

735
00:45:25,398 --> 00:45:26,532
我就知道你这种女人
I just knew someone like you

736
00:45:26,532 --> 00:45:27,831
不会喜欢我这种男人
would never like
someone like me.

737
00:45:27,831 --> 00:45:28,398
天哪！
God

738
00:45:28,398 --> 00:45:29,465
我就知道
I just knew.

739
00:45:29,465 --> 00:45:31,198
什么叫我这种女人?
What do you mean,
someone like me?

740
00:45:31,198 --> 00:45:33,891
就是好女人啊
You know, someone nice.

741
00:45:40,499 --> 00:45:42,298
打电话给我
Call me.

742
00:45:42,298 --> 00:45:44,230
求求你
 Please.

743
00:45:48,398 --> 00:45:50,227
克洛伊！
EIRIK: Chloe!

744
00:46:29,198 --> 00:46:31,187
挖到宝了
Cha-ching!

745
00:46:40,398 --> 00:46:42,387
(空包弹)

746
00:46:44,865 --> 00:46:46,854
(实弹)

747
00:47:00,232 --> 00:47:01,764
你有什么问题吗?
Have you got some
sort of problem?

748
00:47:01,764 --> 00:47:03,696
没有，没问题
No, no problem.

749
00:47:03,831 --> 00:47:05,632
20分钟内喝4杯啤酒
Four beers
in 20 minutes.

750
00:47:05,632 --> 00:47:07,291
没问题
No problem.

751
00:47:08,465 --> 00:47:10,021
滚啦
Fuck off.

752
00:47:17,831 --> 00:47:19,820
一杯啤酒和一杯红酒
JIMMY: Beer and a red wine.

753
00:47:20,532 --> 00:47:21,827
我马上回来
I'll be back.

754
00:47:24,065 --> 00:47:26,098
电影拍得如何?
How's the movie going?

755
00:47:26,098 --> 00:47:30,155
那是欧洲人剥削劳工拍的烂片啦
It's a jumped-up
Eurotrash piece of
rip-off fucking bullshit.

756
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:33,223
拍得不好吗?
Like, in a bad way?

757
00:47:35,632 --> 00:47:37,365
你女朋友很漂亮
Your girlfriend's
very pretty.

758
00:47:37,365 --> 00:47:39,131
她不是我女朋友
She ain't my girlfriend.

759
00:47:39,131 --> 00:47:41,529
她是妓女，我刚才叫的
She's a prostitute
I just picked up.

760
00:47:43,398 --> 00:47:45,731
我都不知道布鲁日有妓女
Didn't know there were
any prostitutes in Bruges.

761
00:47:45,731 --> 00:47:48,131
找对地方就有了
You just have to look
in the right places.

762
00:47:48,131 --> 00:47:50,222
去妓院找
Brothels are good.

763
00:47:51,432 --> 00:47:54,532
你叫的妓女很漂亮
Well, you've picked up
a very pretty prostitute.

764
00:47:54,532 --> 00:47:56,122
谢谢
Thank you.

765
00:48:00,332 --> 00:48:02,560
你是美国人?
You from the States?

766
00:48:02,965 --> 00:48:04,499
对
Yeah.

767
00:48:04,499 --> 00:48:05,865
别排挤美国人哦
But don't hold it
against me.

768
00:48:05,865 --> 00:48:07,626
我尽量
I'll try not to.

769
00:48:08,898 --> 00:48:12,422
尽量别大声或讲蠢话
Just try not to say
anything too loud or crass.

770
00:48:29,664 --> 00:48:32,031
你在喝闷酒?
Hey-ho. Drowning
your sorrows, huh?

771
00:48:32,031 --> 00:48:32,764
闷什么?
What sorrows?

772
00:48:32,764 --> 00:48:35,865
难过你又老又丑啊
You know, being a sad,
old, ugly little man.

773
00:48:35,865 --> 00:48:37,165
麻烦来杯啤酒
One gay beer, please.

774
00:48:37,165 --> 00:48:38,532
约会还好吧?
How'd your date go?

775
00:48:38,532 --> 00:48:40,631
我的约会变成暴力事件
My date involved
two instances of
extreme violence.

776
00:48:40,631 --> 00:48:42,664
她握我老二，我用手指插她
One instance of her hand
on my cock and my finger
up her thing,

777
00:48:42,664 --> 00:48:44,596
没玩多久
which lasted all too briefly.

778
00:48:44,865 --> 00:48:45,731
每次都这样吧?
Isn't that always the way?

779
00:48:45,731 --> 00:48:49,098
我偷了她5公克的高档可卡因
One instance of me
stealing five grams of
her very-high-quality cocaine,

780
00:48:49,098 --> 00:48:51,398
还打瞎了一个白痴小混混
and one instance of me
blinding a poofy
little skinhead.

781
00:48:51,398 --> 00:48:54,664
整体而言，今晚还不错
So, all in all,
my evening pretty much
balanced out fine.

782
00:48:54,664 --> 00:48:56,789
你偷了5公克的可卡因?
You got five grams of coke?

783
00:48:57,898 --> 00:48:59,298
身上有4公克，吸了1公克
I've got four grams on me
and one gram in me,

784
00:48:59,298 --> 00:49:01,998
所以我心跳快得像要心脏病发
which is why me heart
is going like the clappers,as if I'm about to
have a heart attack.

785
00:49:01,998 --> 00:49:03,564
如果我昏倒，请你记得要
So if I collapse
any minute now, please
remember to tell the doctors

786
00:49:03,564 --> 00:49:05,865
跟医生说可能是因为可卡因
that it might have something
to do with the coke.

787
00:49:05,865 --> 00:49:07,631
给我1公克
Give us a gram, then.

788
00:49:07,631 --> 00:49:09,432
你不是说吸毒会沮丧?
I thought you were
laying off, because
it makes you depressed?

789
00:49:09,432 --> 00:49:12,489
知道吗?我现在懒得管了
You know what?
Right now, I don't
really give a fuck.

790
00:49:40,965 --> 00:49:44,056
我今天跟你打招呼你怎么不理?
Why didn't you wave
hello to me today when
I waved hello to you today?

791
00:49:44,198 --> 00:49:46,798
我今天吃很多马的镇静剂
I was on a very strong
horse tranquilizer today.

792
00:49:46,798 --> 00:49:49,764
我见到谁都不打招呼
I wasn't waving
hello to anybody,

793
00:49:49,764 --> 00:49:52,232
可能只会搭理马吧
except maybe to a horse.

794
00:49:52,232 --> 00:49:54,898
你在胡说什么?
Huh? What are you
talking about?

795
00:49:54,898 --> 00:49:57,764
他马的废话啦
Just horseshit.

796
00:49:57,764 --> 00:49:59,598
你是美国人?
You from America?

797
00:49:59,598 --> 00:50:02,265
对，别排挤美国人哦
Yeah. But don't
hold it against me.

798
00:50:02,265 --> 00:50:05,060
这要由我决定吧?
Well, that's for me
to decide, isn't it?

799
00:50:05,298 --> 00:50:06,764
你也是美国人?
Are you from America, too?

800
00:50:06,764 --> 00:50:08,698
不是，我从阿姆斯特丹来的
No, I'm from Amsterdam.

801
00:50:08,698 --> 00:50:09,798
阿姆斯特丹?
(SCOFFS) Amsterdam.

802
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:12,631
阿姆斯特丹不是妓女很多吗?
Amsterdam is just
a load of bloody
prostitutes, isn't it?

803
00:50:12,631 --> 00:50:14,764
对，所以我才来布鲁日
Yes. That's why
I came to Bruges.

804
00:50:14,764 --> 00:50:18,219
来这里卖应该能多赚一点
I thought I'd get
a better price
for my pussy here.

805
00:50:22,498 --> 00:50:24,397
两个怪咖
You two are weird.

806
00:50:26,165 --> 00:50:28,858
要不要可卡因?
Would you like some cocaine?

807
00:50:30,965 --> 00:50:34,795
我还有迷幻药和快乐丸
I've also got some
acid and some ecstasy.

808
00:50:44,432 --> 00:50:47,031
我知道赫夫维勒柴就是自杀的
Herve Villechaize,
I know, did.

809
00:50:47,031 --> 00:50:50,758
危险地带，，的侏儒也自杀
The dwarf off, I think,
The Time Bandits, did.

810
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:53,097
很多侏儒
Lots of midgets...

811
00:50:53,464 --> 00:50:54,798
小矮人
Dwarves, 

812
00:50:54,798 --> 00:50:56,424
都是自杀的
top themselves.

813
00:50:56,898 --> 00:50:58,887
一狗票
Hmm. Shitloads.

814
00:51:00,865 --> 00:51:03,161
你有没有想过?
Would you ever
think about it?

815
00:51:03,965 --> 00:51:07,398
有没有因为你是侏儒而想自杀?
Would you ever think about
killing yourself because
you're a midget?

816
00:51:07,398 --> 00:51:10,564
干！这是什么鸟问题?
Fuck, man!
What kind of
question is that?

817
00:51:10,564 --> 00:51:12,757
只是聊聊天嘛
We're just chatting,
aren't we?

818
00:51:18,831 --> 00:51:19,798
肯尼，你看
See, Ken, 

819
00:51:19,798 --> 00:51:21,965
哈利应该帮我们订这种饭店
this is
the kind of hotel
Harry should have put us in.

820
00:51:21,965 --> 00:51:24,692
5星级的，还有妓女
A five-star,
with prostitutes in.

821
00:51:25,065 --> 00:51:29,157
我有时后觉得哈利不在乎我们
You know, sometimes,
I think Harry doesn't even
give a shit about us at all.

822
00:51:31,498 --> 00:51:33,828
他还是没打电话来吗?
Has he still not called?

823
00:51:34,831 --> 00:51:36,598
没有，还是没打
No. Still hasn't called.

824
00:51:36,598 --> 00:51:38,928
没消息就是好消息
No news is good news, eh?

825
00:51:50,031 --> 00:51:51,929
她是谁?
Who's she?

826
00:51:53,031 --> 00:51:55,190
战争要爆发了
JIMMY: There's gonna be
a war, man.

827
00:51:55,965 --> 00:51:57,464
我有预感
I can see it.

828
00:51:57,464 --> 00:52:01,397
黑人和白人之间要开战了
There's gonna be a war
between the blacks
and between the whites.

829
00:52:01,397 --> 00:52:03,931
你根本连制服都不必穿
You ain't even gonna need
a uniform no more.

830
00:52:03,931 --> 00:52:06,731
这场战争你不能选边站
This ain't gonna be a war
where you pick your side.

831
00:52:06,731 --> 00:52:08,232
阵营早就划分好了
Your side's already
picked for you.

832
00:52:08,232 --> 00:52:10,298
我知道我是哪个阵营
And I know whose side
I'm fighting on.

833
00:52:10,298 --> 00:52:11,731
我要和黑人并肩作战
I'm fighting with the blacks.

834
00:52:11,731 --> 00:52:12,998
叫白人去吃大便啦
The whites are gonna get
their heads kicked in!

835
00:52:12,998 --> 00:52:15,298
这种事由不得你决定
JIMMY: You don't decide
this shit, man.

836
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:17,165
黑白混血儿要站哪一边?
Well, who are
the half-castes
gonna fight with?

837
00:52:17,165 --> 00:52:19,965
当然是跟黑人一起啊
The blacks, man.
That's obvious.

838
00:52:19,965 --> 00:52:23,227
那巴基斯坦人呢?
But what about
the Pakistanis?

839
00:52:23,531 --> 00:52:24,898
黑人
The blacks.

840
00:52:24,898 --> 00:52:27,232
那…
What about...

841
00:52:27,232 --> 00:52:29,561
想个难一点的
Think of a hard one.

842
00:52:29,631 --> 00:52:31,731
那越南人呢?
What about the Vietnamese?

843
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:33,598
黑人！
The blacks!

844
00:52:33,598 --> 00:52:37,156
有越南人我就一定跟黑人同阵线
Well, I'm definitely
fighting with the blacks
if they've got the Vietnamese.

845
00:52:41,998 --> 00:52:43,930
等一下
So, hang on.

846
00:52:44,431 --> 00:52:47,631
白人侏儒都要和黑人侏儒为敌?
Would all of the
white midgets in
the world be fighting against all the black
midgets in the world?

847
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:49,325
对
Yeah.

848
00:52:50,031 --> 00:52:52,394
这是拍片的好题材
That would make a good film!

849
00:52:53,065 --> 00:52:55,831
你绝对不会知道
You don't know how much shit

850
00:52:55,831 --> 00:52:58,498
我吃了黑人侏儒多少亏
I've had to take off
of black midgets, man.

851
00:52:58,498 --> 00:53:01,331
这句话…
That's...

852
00:53:01,331 --> 00:53:02,998
…说得对极了
Undeniably true.

853
00:53:02,998 --> 00:53:06,031
吉米…
See, Jimmy,

854
00:53:06,031 --> 00:53:08,588
我老婆是黑人
my wife was black.

855
00:53:09,232 --> 00:53:11,561
我很爱她
And I loved her very much.

856
00:53:12,464 --> 00:53:14,931
1976年
And in 1976,

857
00:53:14,931 --> 00:53:16,931
她被白人杀死了
she was murdered
by a white man.

858
00:53:16,931 --> 00:53:19,131
所以…
So,

859
00:53:19,131 --> 00:53:24,120
这场大屠杀我要站哪一边?
 where the fuck
am I supposed to stand
in all this blood and carnage?

860
00:53:24,798 --> 00:53:27,491
有抓到凶手吗?
Did they get
the guy who did it?

861
00:53:27,664 --> 00:53:28,931
我有个朋友抓到他了
A friend of mine got him.

862
00:53:28,931 --> 00:53:31,419
他被哈利华特斯逮到了
Harry Waters got him.

863
00:53:32,397 --> 00:53:34,331
告诉我，吉米
So tell me, Jim,

864
00:53:34,331 --> 00:53:38,525
这场圣战我要站哪一边?
whose side do I fight
on in this wonderful war?

865
00:53:40,531 --> 00:53:44,564
我挛你应该衡量所有的选项
I think you need to
weigh up all your options

866
00:53:44,564 --> 00:53:47,553
让你的良知来决定
and let your
conscience decide, Ken.

867
00:53:56,297 --> 00:53:58,631
两个臭婊子
Two manky hookers

868
00:53:58,631 --> 00:54:00,898
和一个种族歧视的侏儒
and a racist dwarf.

869
00:54:00,898 --> 00:54:02,165
我要回家了
I think I'm heading home.

870
00:54:02,165 --> 00:54:04,630
好，我跟你回去
Yeah. I think
I'll come with you.

871
00:54:06,431 --> 00:54:07,664
怎么…
What's...

872
00:54:07,664 --> 00:54:09,357
闪开啦，矮子！
Back off, shorty!

873
00:54:09,464 --> 00:54:11,124
你又不会空手道
You don't know karate.

874
00:54:11,698 --> 00:54:12,031
你活该啦
Don't say you didn't
have it coming.

875
00:54:12,031 --> 00:54:13,331
你活该啦
Don't say you didn't
have it coming.

876
00:54:13,331 --> 00:54:14,764
好痛
How painful

877
00:54:14,764 --> 00:54:16,593
矮冬瓜！
Shortarse!

878
00:55:43,031 --> 00:55:44,131
我要找尤利
Meeting Yuri.

879
00:55:44,131 --> 00:55:45,892
我就是尤利
Yes, I'm Yuri.

880
00:56:14,798 --> 00:56:18,195
华特斯先生说可能用得上
Mr. Waters said
that might be necessary.

881
00:56:20,898 --> 00:56:24,694
康宁埃斯崔公园有很多暗处可躲
There are a lot of alcoves
in the Koningin Astrid Park.

882
00:56:25,197 --> 00:56:27,993
你会用暗处，，这个词吧?
You use this word,
"alcoves"?

883
00:56:28,231 --> 00:56:30,431
暗处?有时后会用
"Alcoves"? Yes. Sometimes.

884
00:56:30,431 --> 00:56:34,830
圣诞节没什么人会躲在暗处
There are not many
people around in these
alcoves in Christmastime.

885
00:56:35,164 --> 00:56:37,297
我要是想杀人
If I were to murder a man,

886
00:56:37,297 --> 00:56:39,820
就会选在这里
I would murder him here.

887
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:44,264
你确定可以说暗处，，吗?
Are you sure this is
the right word, "alcoves"?

888
00:56:44,264 --> 00:56:46,423
可以啊
"Alcoves," yes.

889
00:56:46,631 --> 00:56:48,065
就是不显眼的角落
It's kind of like
"nooks and crannies."

890
00:56:48,065 --> 00:56:50,731
对，不显眼的角落
"Nooks and crannies," yes.

891
00:56:50,731 --> 00:56:52,231
这样讲比较正确
Perhaps this would be
more accurate.

892
00:56:52,231 --> 00:56:54,965
不显眼的角落，不是暗处
"Nooks and crannies,"
rather than "alcoves."

893
00:56:54,965 --> 00:56:56,828
对
 Yeah.

894
00:57:01,965 --> 00:57:04,331
你会下手吧?
You are going to do it,
aren't you?

895
00:57:04,331 --> 00:57:06,431
不然华特斯先生会很失望…
 Mr. Waters
will be very disappointed...

896
00:57:06,431 --> 00:57:08,920
我当然会下手
Of course I'm going to
fucking do it.

897
00:57:10,431 --> 00:57:12,954
这是我的职业
It's what I do.

898
00:57:18,331 --> 00:57:22,025
你朋友今天早上怪怪的
Your friend was behaving
rather oddly this morning.

899
00:57:29,064 --> 00:57:30,798
怎样怪?
Oddly? How?

900
00:57:30,798 --> 00:57:33,097
他问我宝宝的事
Well, he asked me
about the baby,

901
00:57:33,097 --> 00:57:35,731
问我想要男生还是女生
 and if
I wanted a boy or a girl.

902
00:57:35,731 --> 00:57:38,998
我说只要健康就好了
I said I didn't mind
as long as it's
healthy, of course.

903
00:57:38,998 --> 00:57:40,364
然后他…
But then 

904
00:57:40,364 --> 00:57:44,898
他给了我两百欧元说是要给宝宝
he gave me 200 euros
to give to the baby.

905
00:57:44,898 --> 00:57:48,831
我拒绝了，可是他…
I refused, obviously,

906
00:57:48,831 --> 00:57:51,422
他坚持要我收下
but he was quite insistent.

907
00:57:51,931 --> 00:57:55,531
请你帮我还给他好吗?
Would you give it
back to him when
you see him?

908
00:57:55,531 --> 00:57:57,197
不是我不知感恩
I don't want to appear
ungrateful, 

909
00:57:57,197 --> 00:57:59,564
但他好像只剩这些钱
but it seemed
like all the money he had.

910
00:57:59,564 --> 00:58:00,598
你知道他在哪儿吗?
Do you know where he is now?

911
00:58:00,598 --> 00:58:03,223
他说他要去公园
He said he was
going to the park.

912
00:59:02,997 --> 00:59:04,963
雷蒙，对不起
Sorry, Ray.

913
00:59:06,464 --> 00:59:07,930
对不起
I'm sorry.

914
00:59:38,564 --> 00:59:39,698
雷蒙，不要！
Ray, don't!

915
00:59:39,698 --> 00:59:40,898
搞什么?
Fucking hell!

916
00:59:40,898 --> 00:59:42,331
你他妈的从哪儿冒出来的?
Where the fuck
did you come from?

917
00:59:42,331 --> 00:59:45,364
我躲起来啦，你他妈的在干嘛?
I was behind the thing.
What the fuck are
you doing, Ray?

918
00:59:45,364 --> 00:59:47,097
那你又他妈的在干嘛?
What the fuck
are you doing?

919
00:59:47,097 --> 00:59:48,529
没有啊
Nothing.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

920
00:59:50,364 --> 00:59:52,159
天哪！
Oh, my God!

921
00:59:53,764 --> 00:59:55,331
你要杀我
You were gonna kill me.

922
00:59:55,331 --> 00:59:56,798
不是啦，我…
No, I wasn't.

923
00:59:56,798 --> 00:59:58,897
你要自杀
You were gonna
kill yourself!

924
00:59:58,897 --> 01:00:01,631
我…
I

925
01:00:01,631 --> 01:00:03,164
这是我的权利啊
I'm allowed to.

926
01:00:03,164 --> 01:00:04,264
才不是
No, you're not!

927
01:00:04,264 --> 01:00:05,897
怎样?
What?

928
01:00:05,897 --> 01:00:07,731
我不能自杀，你就能杀我?
I'm not allowed to
and you are?

929
01:00:07,731 --> 01:00:09,697
这公平吗?
How's that fair?

930
01:00:15,930 --> 01:00:19,055
能不能找个地方谈谈?
Can we go somewhere
and talk about this, please?

931
01:00:22,431 --> 01:00:24,598
我根本不打算动手
I wasn't gonna go
through with it, Ray.

932
01:00:24,598 --> 01:00:28,052
你看起来就是要动手啊
You fucking looked like
you were gonna go
fucking through with it.

933
01:00:30,764 --> 01:00:32,498
你的枪是哪来的?
Where'd you get that gun?

934
01:00:32,498 --> 01:00:33,964
哈利的朋友
A friend of Harry's.

935
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:36,055
干！
Fuck, man.

936
01:00:38,130 --> 01:00:40,153
给我看看
Let me see it.

937
01:00:43,598 --> 01:00:46,063
还有消音器
Silencer, too.

938
01:00:47,631 --> 01:00:49,426
不错
Nice.

939
01:00:54,297 --> 01:00:57,888
我的是女生用的枪
Mine's a bloody girl's gun.

940
01:01:05,798 --> 01:01:07,397
给我保管
I'm keeping it.

941
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:09,556
你说什么?
Pardon me?

942
01:01:10,531 --> 01:01:11,197
把枪还我
Give me me gun back.

943
01:01:11,197 --> 01:01:13,064
我不会还你的
You're not getting it back.

944
01:01:13,064 --> 01:01:14,064
你有自杀倾向
You're a suicide case.

945
01:01:14,064 --> 01:01:16,897
而你想一枪毙了我
And you were
trying to shoot me
in the fucking head.

946
01:01:16,897 --> 01:01:18,598
我不会还你的
You're not getting
that gun back.

947
01:01:18,598 --> 01:01:21,331
我今天运气真好
A great day this has
turned out to be.

948
01:01:21,331 --> 01:01:23,064
我想自杀
I'm suicidal,

949
01:01:23,064 --> 01:01:24,830
我朋友想杀我
me mate tries
to kill me,

950
01:01:24,830 --> 01:01:26,364
我的枪被没收
me gun gets nicked

951
01:01:26,364 --> 01:01:29,364
我们还在布鲁日
and we're still
in fucking Bruges.

952
01:01:29,364 --> 01:01:31,064
听着…
Listen, 

953
01:01:31,064 --> 01:01:33,997
我给你一点钱，送你上火车
I'm gonna give you
some money and put you
on a train somewhere.

954
01:01:33,997 --> 01:01:35,431
回英国?
Back to England?

955
01:01:35,431 --> 01:01:37,798
你不能回英国，回去就死定了
You can't go back
to England, Ray.
You'd be a dead man!

956
01:01:37,798 --> 01:01:40,364
肯尼，我想死啊
(CRYING) I want
to be a dead man.

957
01:01:40,364 --> 01:01:43,228
你是不是搞错什么?
Have you been
missing something?

958
01:01:43,864 --> 01:01:45,364
你不想死啦
You don't want to be
a dead man, Ray.

959
01:01:45,364 --> 01:01:47,330
肯尼！
Ken

960
01:01:48,997 --> 01:01:51,691
我杀了一个小男孩
I killed a little boy!

961
01:02:04,797 --> 01:02:07,764
那就不要再犯啊
Then save the
next little boy.

962
01:02:08,531 --> 01:02:11,297
随便去哪里都好
Just go away somewhere,

963
01:02:11,297 --> 01:02:15,127
金盆洗手，做点正当事
get out of this business
and try to do something good.

964
01:02:15,830 --> 01:02:18,897
你死了对谁都没好处
You're not gonna
help anybody dead.

965
01:02:18,897 --> 01:02:21,489
那个小孩不会复活
You're not gonna
bring that boy back.

966
01:02:23,763 --> 01:02:26,662
但你可以不要再犯
But you might save
the next one.

967
01:02:27,664 --> 01:02:30,331
要我做什么?当医生?
What am I gonna be,
a doctor?

968
01:02:30,331 --> 01:02:32,231
那要考试的
You need exams.

969
01:02:32,231 --> 01:02:34,397
随便做什么都好
Do anything, Ray.

970
01:02:34,397 --> 01:02:36,659
做什么都好
Do anything.

971
01:02:39,631 --> 01:02:40,364
(亲爱的肯尼：)

972
01:02:40,364 --> 01:02:41,631
(我去公园，免得她还要清理)

973
01:02:41,631 --> 01:02:42,358
(雷蒙)

974
01:02:51,897 --> 01:02:53,659
他是个大烂人！
RAY: What a wanker!

975
01:02:55,431 --> 01:02:59,364
他说这趟旅程…
He said this whole trip,

976
01:02:59,364 --> 01:03:02,125
这次来布鲁日
this whole being
in Bruges thing,

977
01:03:02,598 --> 01:03:07,030
是要让你在死前开心最后一次
was just to give you
one last, joyful memory
before you died.

978
01:03:07,864 --> 01:03:10,422
在布鲁日?
In Bruges?

979
01:03:14,964 --> 01:03:17,624
去巴哈马群岛还差不多
The Bahamas, maybe.

980
01:03:18,664 --> 01:03:21,264
干嘛挑在布鲁日?
Why fucking Bruges?

981
01:03:21,264 --> 01:03:23,821
大概是比较便宜吧
I suppose it's cheaper.

982
01:03:29,763 --> 01:03:32,594
剩下的迷幻药和快乐丸
The rest of the acid
and the ecstasy.

983
01:03:33,464 --> 01:03:36,123
能不能把枪还我?
Can I have me gun
back, please?

984
01:03:40,598 --> 01:03:43,257
要我做什么?
What am I gonna do, Ken?

985
01:03:43,631 --> 01:03:45,564
我能做什么?
What am I gonna do?

986
01:03:45,564 --> 01:03:47,564
反正你走就对了
Just keep moving.

987
01:03:47,564 --> 01:03:49,464
你走就对了
Keep on moving.

988
01:03:49,464 --> 01:03:52,123
别再想了
Try not to think about it.

989
01:03:52,763 --> 01:03:54,364
也许学个新语言?
Learn a new language, maybe?

990
01:03:54,364 --> 01:03:56,464
对啦，我连英语都讲不好
Sure, I can
hardly do English.

991
01:03:56,464 --> 01:03:57,598
所以我喜欢欧洲
That's one thing
I like about Europe, though.

992
01:03:57,598 --> 01:03:59,830
不必学他们的语言
You don't have to learn
any of their languages.

993
01:03:59,830 --> 01:04:02,598
暂时别回家
Just forget about
home for a while.

994
01:04:02,598 --> 01:04:06,130
看看6，7年后会变成怎样
See how the land lies
in six years, seven years.

995
01:04:06,130 --> 01:04:09,064
7年也没多久啦
Seven years is not that long.

996
01:04:09,064 --> 01:04:11,331
比那个小孩活得久
It's longer than
that boy got.

997
01:04:11,331 --> 01:04:14,763
我他妈的第一次出任务
Me first fucking job.

998
01:04:14,964 --> 01:04:17,862
我真是个好杀手啊
Great hitman
I turned out to be.

999
01:04:21,097 --> 01:04:24,688
有些人就是不适合当杀手
Some people just aren't
cut out for it, Ray.

1000
01:04:24,897 --> 01:04:27,363
你适合吗?
Are you?

1001
01:04:32,297 --> 01:04:35,598
你几时要回英国?
When are you
going back to England?

1002
01:04:35,598 --> 01:04:37,663
我过两个小时就回去了
I'll head back
in a couple of hours
or something.

1003
01:04:37,663 --> 01:04:39,997
哈利不会生你的气吧?
Harry's not gonna be
mad at you, is he?

1004
01:04:39,997 --> 01:04:41,963
你放我走了?
For letting me go?

1005
01:04:42,164 --> 01:04:43,130
哈利那边我会搞定的
I'll sort out Harry.

1006
01:04:43,130 --> 01:04:46,331
跟他说我搞不好很快就自杀了
Just tell him I'll have
probably killed meself
in a fortnight, anyway.

1007
01:04:46,331 --> 01:04:48,524
你不会吧?
You won't, will you, Ray?

1008
01:05:07,730 --> 01:05:10,297
哈利?我是肯尼
Harry? It's Ken.

1009
01:05:10,297 --> 01:05:12,456
你听这个声音
Listen to this noise.

1010
01:05:14,130 --> 01:05:16,431
你知不知道这是什么?
Do you know what that is?

1011
01:05:16,431 --> 01:05:17,964
我知道你听得出这是火车
Yeah, I know
you know it's a train.

1012
01:05:17,964 --> 01:05:20,123
你知道什么火车吗?
Do you know what train?

1013
01:05:20,397 --> 01:05:22,663
雷蒙刚上这班火车
Well, it's a train that
Ray just got on, 

1014
01:05:22,663 --> 01:05:23,930
他还活得好好的
and
he's alive and he's well,

1015
01:05:23,930 --> 01:05:26,364
他不知道何去何从，我也不知道
and he doesn't know
where he's going
and neither do I.

1016
01:05:26,364 --> 01:05:29,364
你想杀我就动手吧
So if you need to
do your worst,
do your worst.

1017
01:05:29,364 --> 01:05:32,563
你有旅馆的地址，我在这里等你
You've got the
address of the hotel.
I'll be here waiting.

1018
01:05:32,563 --> 01:05:35,763
反正我爱上布鲁日了
Because I've got to quite
like Bruges, now.

1019
01:05:35,763 --> 01:05:37,922
他妈的很有童话故事的感觉
It's like a fucking
fairytale or something.

1020
01:06:07,364 --> 01:06:08,795
哈利！
Harry.

1021
01:06:09,331 --> 01:06:10,997
哈利！
Harry!

1022
01:06:10,997 --> 01:06:12,264
干嘛?
What?

1023
01:06:12,264 --> 01:06:14,331
那只是没生命的东西
It's an inanimate
fucking object.

1024
01:06:14,331 --> 01:06:17,092
你也是他妈的没生命的东西啦！
You're an inanimate
fucking object!

1025
01:06:26,997 --> 01:06:29,830
你们要听妈妈和今本阿姨的话
Now, you lot be good
for your mummy
and lmamoto, okay?

1026
01:06:29,830 --> 01:06:31,897
因为爸爸要出差几天
'Cause Daddy's got to
go away for a few days.

1027
01:06:31,897 --> 01:06:32,964
你要去哪儿?
Where are you going?

1028
01:06:32,964 --> 01:06:34,597
我要去布鲁日
I've got to go to Bruges.

1029
01:06:34,597 --> 01:06:36,331
布鲁日?那是哪里?
Bruges? Where's that?

1030
01:06:36,331 --> 01:06:38,229
在比利时
It's in Belgium.

1031
01:06:38,697 --> 01:06:41,264
去比利时要干嘛?
Why would anybody
have to go to Belgium?

1032
01:06:41,264 --> 01:06:43,457
我有事要处理
'Cause I've got to
sort something out.

1033
01:06:44,064 --> 01:06:46,530
和电话有关吗?
Is it something
to do with the phone?

1034
01:06:46,530 --> 01:06:48,928
和肯尼有关
It's something
to do with Ken.

1035
01:06:49,964 --> 01:06:52,828
这是名誉问题
It's a matter of honor.

1036
01:06:52,997 --> 01:06:55,827
不会危险吧?
Well, it ain't gonna
be dangerous, is it?

1037
01:06:58,697 --> 01:07:01,964
和名誉有关的事他妈的当然危险
Well, of course it's
gonna be dangerous if it's
a matter of fucking honor!

1038
01:07:01,964 --> 01:07:03,563
带几个人一起去吧
You are bringing
the fellas with you?

1039
01:07:03,563 --> 01:07:06,325
你会带人去吧?
Tell me you're bringing
the fellas with you.

1040
01:07:07,097 --> 01:07:08,864
哈利！
Harry.

1041
01:07:08,864 --> 01:07:11,730
很抱歉刚才骂你是没生命的东西
I'm sorry for calling you
an inanimate object.

1042
01:07:11,730 --> 01:07:13,889
那是气话
I was upset.

1043
01:08:52,897 --> 01:08:54,630
你是爱尔兰人?
You're Irish?

1044
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:56,358
对
Yes.

1045
01:08:56,864 --> 01:08:59,489
你叫什么名字?
What is your name?

1046
01:09:00,663 --> 01:09:03,857
戴瑞波勒里
Derek Perlurrl.

1047
01:09:06,630 --> 01:09:08,459
你有答，，加拿大人吗?
You hit the Canadian.

1048
01:09:09,264 --> 01:09:10,964
你有答，，加拿大人吗?
You hit the Canadian.

1049
01:09:10,964 --> 01:09:13,864
我答，，加拿大人?
L"heet" the Canadian?

1050
01:09:13,864 --> 01:09:15,887
我听不懂你在说什么
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1051
01:09:17,630 --> 01:09:18,730
就是他！
That's him!

1052
01:09:18,730 --> 01:09:21,094
就是那个王八蛋！
That's the motherfucker.

1053
01:09:26,497 --> 01:09:28,929
你有答，，加拿大人吧?
You hit the Canadian, yeah?

1054
01:09:29,563 --> 01:09:31,264
加拿大人?
Canadian? 

1055
01:09:31,264 --> 01:09:32,923
干！
Shit.

1056
01:09:38,297 --> 01:09:40,330
我们要带你回布鲁日
We're taking you
back to Bruges.

1057
01:09:40,330 --> 01:09:41,819
好极了
Brilliant.

1058
01:10:08,797 --> 01:10:10,820
真衰啊
Aye aye.

1059
01:10:11,064 --> 01:10:14,053
你自己选吧，华特斯先生
YURl: Take your pick,
Mr. Waters.

1060
01:10:16,897 --> 01:10:18,663
乌兹?
(CHUCKLES) An Uzi?

1061
01:10:18,663 --> 01:10:21,463
我又不从他妈的是洛杉矶中南部来的
I'm not from South Central
Los fucking Angeles.

1062
01:10:21,463 --> 01:10:25,231
我不是来扫射20个10岁小孩
I didn't come here to shoot
20 black 10-year-olds
in a fucking drive-by.

1063
01:10:25,231 --> 01:10:28,129
我要一般人用的普通手枪
I want a normal gun
for a normal person.

1064
01:10:39,530 --> 01:10:42,030
我早知道他不会动手
I knew he wouldn't
kill the guy.

1065
01:10:42,030 --> 01:10:43,797
我跟他说暗处时
I could see it in his eyes

1066
01:10:43,797 --> 01:10:47,025
看他的眼神就知道了
when I was telling him
about the alcoves.

1067
01:10:47,296 --> 01:10:48,263
说什么?
About the what?
The alcoves.

1068
01:10:48,263 --> 01:10:49,064
暗处
The alcoves 

1069
01:10:49,064 --> 01:10:52,552
康宁埃斯崔公园的暗处
in the
Koningin Astrid Park.

1070
01:10:54,363 --> 01:10:56,930
我还有达姆弹
Oh, I also have
some dumdums.

1071
01:10:56,930 --> 01:10:58,597
是叫达姆弹吧?
You use this word,
"dumdums"? 

1072
01:10:58,597 --> 01:11:00,296
把头炸掉的那种子弹
The bullets
that make the head explode?

1073
01:11:00,296 --> 01:11:01,663
对，达姆弹
Dumdums, yeah.

1074
01:11:01,663 --> 01:11:04,595
你要不要达姆弹?
Would you like some
of these dumdums?

1075
01:11:04,830 --> 01:11:07,557
我知道我不应该拿
I know I shouldn't,

1076
01:11:08,164 --> 01:11:10,187
但我还是拿吧
but I will.

1077
01:11:14,530 --> 01:11:16,519
王八蛋！
Motherfucker.

1078
01:11:17,296 --> 01:11:18,396
他在跟我讲话吗?
Is he talking to me?

1079
01:11:18,396 --> 01:11:19,797
不是，艾瑞克是自己人
No, Eirik's
on your side,
Mr. Waters.

1080
01:11:19,797 --> 01:11:22,730
你那位朋友昨晚把他打瞎了
Your young friend
blinded him last night.

1081
01:11:22,730 --> 01:11:23,697
是雷蒙?
Ray did?

1082
01:11:23,697 --> 01:11:25,997
我想抢劫他
I was trying to rob him

1083
01:11:25,997 --> 01:11:28,430
他抢走了我的枪
and he took my gun from me.

1084
01:11:28,430 --> 01:11:30,897
那把枪里都是空包弹
And the gun
was full of blanks,

1085
01:11:30,897 --> 01:11:33,563
他用空包弹射我的眼睛
and he shot the blank
into my eye.

1086
01:11:33,563 --> 01:11:35,030
现在…
And now, 

1087
01:11:35,030 --> 01:11:37,263
我这只眼睛瞎了
I cannot see
from this eye ever again,

1088
01:11:37,263 --> 01:11:38,864
医生说的
the doctors say.

1089
01:11:38,864 --> 01:11:42,421
坦白说，你好像是活该
Well, to be honest,
it sounds like
it was all your fault.

1090
01:11:42,964 --> 01:11:43,396
什么?
What?

1091
01:11:43,396 --> 01:11:46,263
你想抢劫别人，只用空包弹
I mean, basically, if you're
robbing a man and you're
only carrying blanks,

1092
01:11:46,263 --> 01:11:48,196
你让别人抢走了你的枪
and you allow your gun
to be taken off you,

1093
01:11:48,196 --> 01:11:51,997
又让他用空包弹射你的眼睛
and you allow yourself
to be shot in the
eye with a blank,

1094
01:11:51,997 --> 01:11:54,130
对方一定靠你很近吧
for which I assume
the person has to get
quite close to you, then,

1095
01:11:54,130 --> 01:11:57,463
你会这么笨就是你活该
yeah, really,
it's all your fault
for being such a poof.

1096
01:11:57,463 --> 01:12:00,463
别唉唉叫了，他妈的开心一点嘛
So why don't you
stop whingeing
and cheer the fuck up?

1097
01:12:00,463 --> 01:12:04,361
艾瑞克！你最好冷静点
YURl: Eirik, I really
wouldn't respond.

1098
01:12:10,164 --> 01:12:11,430
你不是想杀他吗?
I thought you wanted
the guy dead?

1099
01:12:11,430 --> 01:12:13,663
我是想杀他，我想他妈把他千刀万剐
I do want the guy dead.
I want him fucking crucified.

1100
01:12:13,663 --> 01:12:15,196
但他把你打瞎了
But it don't change the fact
that 

1101
01:12:15,196 --> 01:12:18,095
这个事实改变不了吧?是吧？
he stitched you up like
a blind, little gay boy.Does it?

1102
01:12:19,930 --> 01:12:22,293
谢谢你的枪，尤利
Thanks for the gun, Yuri.

1103
01:13:28,864 --> 01:13:30,693
怎样?
Well?

1104
01:13:32,163 --> 01:13:34,430
他有自杀倾向，哈利
The boy is suicidal, Harry.

1105
01:13:34,430 --> 01:13:36,964
他根本是行尸走肉了
He's a walking dead man.

1106
01:13:36,964 --> 01:13:39,030
一直讲地狱和炼狱的事
Keeps going on
about Hell and purgatory...

1107
01:13:39,030 --> 01:13:41,430
我昨天打电话给你说什么?
When I phoned you
yesterday, did I ask you,

1108
01:13:41,430 --> 01:13:44,964
帮个忙，请你给雷蒙心理谘商?
"Ken, will you do me
a favor and become
Ray's psychiatrist, please?"

1109
01:13:44,964 --> 01:13:49,697
不是，我是要你他妈的帮我杀了他
No. What I think I asked you
was, " Could you go blow
his fucking head off for me?"

1110
01:13:49,697 --> 01:13:51,730
他有自杀倾向?
"He's suicidal"?

1111
01:13:51,730 --> 01:13:53,930
我有自杀倾向，你有自杀倾向
I'm suicidal. You're suicidal.

1112
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:55,430
大家他妈的都有自杀倾向
Everybody's fucking suicidal!

1113
01:13:55,430 --> 01:13:57,597
不能一直这样下去
We don't all keep
going on about it!

1114
01:13:57,597 --> 01:13:59,430
他自杀了吗?
Has he killed himself yet?

1115
01:13:59,430 --> 01:14:02,063
没有嘛，那他就没自杀倾向了
No. So he's not
fucking suicidal, is he?

1116
01:14:02,063 --> 01:14:04,597
他早上拿枪抵着头，我阻止了他
He put a loaded gun
to his head this morning.
I stopped him.

1117
01:14:04,597 --> 01:14:07,757
什么?他妈的愈来愈离谱了
He... What?
This gets fucking worse!

1118
01:14:08,096 --> 01:14:09,163
我们当时在公园
We were down in the park...

1119
01:14:09,163 --> 01:14:11,152
先让我搞清楚
Let me get this right.

1120
01:14:11,296 --> 01:14:13,129
你们在公园?
You were down in the park?

1121
01:14:13,129 --> 01:14:15,330
他妈的这有什么关系?
What's that got to do
with fucking anything?

1122
01:14:15,330 --> 01:14:18,230
我先搞清楚，你不只拒绝杀他
Let me get this right.
Not only have you
refused to kill the boy,

1123
01:14:18,230 --> 01:14:20,497
他要自杀你还阻止他
you've even stopped the boy
from killing himself,

1124
01:14:20,497 --> 01:14:21,964
他自杀就解决了我的问题
which would have
solved my problem,

1125
01:14:21,964 --> 01:14:23,363
也解决了你的问题
which would have
solved your problem,

1126
01:14:23,363 --> 01:14:25,196
好像也能解决他的问题
which sounds like
it would've solved
the boy's problem.

1127
01:14:25,196 --> 01:14:26,763
这样解决不了他的问题
It wouldn't have
solved his problem.

1128
01:14:26,763 --> 01:14:28,196
肯尼…
Ken, 

1129
01:14:28,196 --> 01:14:29,797
要是我杀了小孩
if I had
killed a little kid,

1130
01:14:29,797 --> 01:14:30,930
不管是不是故意的
accidentally or otherwise,

1131
01:14:30,930 --> 01:14:32,196
我都不会想太多
I wouldn't have
thought twice.

1132
01:14:32,196 --> 01:14:34,129
我他妈的当场就会自杀了
I'd have killed myself
on the fucking spot.
On the fucking spot.

1133
01:14:34,129 --> 01:14:35,296
他妈的当场就自杀
I'd have stuck
the gun 

1134
01:14:35,296 --> 01:14:37,430
我他妈的马上就饮弹自尽
in me mouth
on the fucking spot!

1135
01:14:37,430 --> 01:14:39,430
那是你，哈利
That's you, Harry.

1136
01:14:39,430 --> 01:14:41,296
他还有改变的空间
The boy has the
capacity to change.

1137
01:14:41,296 --> 01:14:43,730
他还能过正常人的生活
The boy has the capacity
to do something
decent with his life.

1138
01:14:43,730 --> 01:14:45,563
不好意思哦
Excuse me, Ken.

1139
01:14:45,563 --> 01:14:48,029
我也有改变的空间
I have the capacity
to change.

1140
01:14:48,029 --> 01:14:49,797
对啦
Yeah, 

1141
01:14:49,797 --> 01:14:52,096
他妈的你只会变得更糟
you do.
You've the capacity
to get fucking worse!

1142
01:14:52,096 --> 01:14:54,763
对，终于讲到重点了
Yeah, now I'm
getting down to it!

1143
01:14:54,763 --> 01:14:56,697
哈利，面对现实吧
Harry, let's face it.

1144
01:14:56,697 --> 01:14:59,330
我不是在说笑，无意冒犯
And I'm not being funny,
I mean no disrespect,

1145
01:14:59,330 --> 01:15:00,996
但你很讨人厌
but you're a cunt.

1146
01:15:00,996 --> 01:15:03,830
现在讨人厌，一直都讨人厌
You're a cunt now,
you've always been a cunt.

1147
01:15:03,830 --> 01:15:07,563
你只会变得更讨人厌
And the only thing that's
gonna change is you're gonna
become an even bigger cunt.

1148
01:15:07,563 --> 01:15:09,196
还会多生讨人厌的小孩
Maybe have some
more cunt kids.

1149
01:15:09,196 --> 01:15:11,296
别扯我的小孩，干他妈的他们屁事?
Leave my kids
fucking out of it.
What have they done?

1150
01:15:11,296 --> 01:15:13,897
他妈的收回你刚才骂我小孩那句的话
You fucking retract that bit
about my cunt fucking kids!

1151
01:15:13,897 --> 01:15:16,196
我收回你小孩他妈的讨人厌那句话
I retract that bit about
your cunt fucking kids.

1152
01:15:16,196 --> 01:15:18,463
他妈的竟敢侮辱我的小孩！
Insulting my fucking kids!

1153
01:15:18,463 --> 01:15:19,964
你太过分了
That's going overboard, mate!

1154
01:15:19,964 --> 01:15:22,429
我不是收回了吗?
I retracted it, didn't I?

1155
01:15:25,230 --> 01:15:26,363
你还是讨人厌啊
Still leaves you
being a cunt.

1156
01:15:26,363 --> 01:15:28,795
我他妈的知道了啦！
Yeah, I fucking got that.

1157
01:15:47,396 --> 01:15:49,828
雷蒙人呢?
Where's Ray now?

1158
01:15:50,330 --> 01:15:52,864
现在雷蒙有可能在
Oh, right about now,
Ray is in one or other

1159
01:15:52,864 --> 01:15:57,530
欧洲本土的任何地方
of the one million towns in
mainland Europe it's possible
to be in, 

1160
01:15:57,530 --> 01:15:58,995
反正不是这里
other than here.

1161
01:16:12,563 --> 01:16:14,797
找到我朋友就还你钱
I'll get all the money
back to you soon as I
get through to me friend.

1162
01:16:14,797 --> 01:16:16,630
没关系啦，雷蒙
It's not a problem,
Raymond.

1163
01:16:16,630 --> 01:16:19,430
迷幻药和快乐丸我也会还你
And I'll get all your acid
and your ecstasy
back to you, too.

1164
01:16:19,430 --> 01:16:20,929
英国式幽默
English humor!

1165
01:16:20,929 --> 01:16:23,725
我想你应该带了枪
I'm assuming you've
got your gun on you.

1166
01:16:26,530 --> 01:16:29,029
尤里很幽默吧?
That Yuri bloke's
a funny fella, isn't he?

1167
01:16:29,029 --> 01:16:31,291
他会做瑜珈
He does yoga.

1168
01:16:31,530 --> 01:16:32,897
暗处
"The alcoves."

1169
01:16:32,897 --> 01:16:35,727
他讲暗处是什么意思?
Was he going on
to you about the alcoves?

1170
01:16:36,497 --> 01:16:39,691
康宁埃斯崔公园有很多暗处可躲
"The alcoves
in the Koningin Astrid Park."

1171
01:16:47,797 --> 01:16:50,990
我知道该做的事你就得做
Harry, I know you gotta do
what you gotta do.

1172
01:16:51,530 --> 01:16:53,296
但这里人太多了
It's a bit crowded
round here, you know?

1173
01:16:53,296 --> 01:16:57,854
他妈的我不会在比利时人群中枪战的
Well, I'm not gonna
have a shootout in the middle of a thousand
fucking Belgians, am I?

1174
01:16:59,263 --> 01:17:03,059
更何况还有其他国家的人来渡假
Not to mention
the other nationalities,
just on their holidays.

1175
01:17:04,563 --> 01:17:07,497
来看天鹅和哥德式的童话故事
To see the swans
and the Gothic and all
the fairytale stuff, eh?

1176
01:17:07,497 --> 01:17:10,196
你想惹毛我吗?
Are you trying to
fucking wind me up?

1177
01:17:10,196 --> 01:17:11,029
没有
No, Harry.

1178
01:17:11,029 --> 01:17:13,396
你还骂我和我的小孩讨人厌
On top of calling me a cunt
and calling me kids cunts.

1179
01:17:13,396 --> 01:17:16,363
他妈的真想现在就毙了你
I might just have to
fucking shoot you right here.

1180
01:17:16,363 --> 01:17:18,420
拜托！
Christ!

1181
01:17:20,996 --> 01:17:23,087
我们上去钟楼
Let's go up the bell tower.

1182
01:17:24,129 --> 01:17:26,430
这么晚了应该很安静
Be quiet up there
this time of evening.

1183
01:17:26,430 --> 01:17:28,225
上去吧
Let's go up there.

1184
01:17:46,797 --> 01:17:49,990
对，加拿大人
Yeah. Canadians.

1185
01:17:50,396 --> 01:17:51,763
我觉得有点难过
I feel a bit bad.

1186
01:17:51,763 --> 01:17:53,630
他们没杀约翰蓝侬吧?
They didn't kill
John Lennon, did they?

1187
01:17:53,630 --> 01:17:56,063
我再过两天要出庭
Anyway, supposed to turn up
to court here in two days.

1188
01:17:56,063 --> 01:17:57,363
你会去吗?
Are you going to turn up?

1189
01:17:57,363 --> 01:18:00,454
不知道，我留下来要干嘛?
Don't know.
What have I got to
stay for really?

1190
01:18:02,896 --> 01:18:06,351
为了你这无聊的一生
The most beautiful woman

1191
01:18:07,129 --> 01:18:09,996
前所未见的…
you've ever seen

1192
01:18:09,996 --> 01:18:13,053
…绝世大美女
in all of your stupid life.

1193
01:18:22,863 --> 01:18:24,829
今晚钟楼不开放
The tower is closed
this evening.

1194
01:18:24,829 --> 01:18:27,096
不可能，应该要开放到7点
No way. It's supposed
to be open till 7:00.

1195
01:18:27,096 --> 01:18:29,296
钟楼通常是开放到7点
The tower is usually
open until 7:00.

1196
01:18:29,296 --> 01:18:31,996
昨天有个美国人在上面心脏病发
Yesterday an American
had a heart attack
up the tower.

1197
01:18:31,996 --> 01:18:33,863
今天钟楼不开放
Today the tower is closed.

1198
01:18:33,863 --> 01:18:35,163
怪咖，这一百欧元给你
Here, cranky, here's
100 for you. 

1199
01:18:35,163 --> 01:18:37,356
我们只上去20分钟
We're only
gonna be 20 minutes.

1200
01:18:42,763 --> 01:18:45,663
今晚钟楼…
The tower is closed

1201
01:18:45,663 --> 01:18:48,896
…不开放
this evening.

1202
01:18:48,896 --> 01:18:51,953
懂吗，英国人?
Understand, Englishman?

1203
01:19:30,463 --> 01:19:31,929
吉米…
Jimmy, I've been
wanting to say

1204
01:19:31,929 --> 01:19:35,827
我要为那天晚上用手刀劈你道歉
I'm really sorry for
karate-chopping you
the other night.

1205
01:19:35,963 --> 01:19:38,088
我太失礼了
That was way out of order.

1206
01:19:38,363 --> 01:19:39,896
雷蒙，你知道吗?
You know, Ray, 

1207
01:19:39,896 --> 01:19:41,063
如果若你们俩不要
I'd find it
easier to believe 

1208
01:19:41,063 --> 01:19:44,729
他妈的当我的面嘲笑我
and
forgive you, somehow,

1209
01:19:44,729 --> 01:19:48,923
我会比较容易相信和原谅你
if the two of you weren't
laughing straight
in my fucking face!

1210
01:19:50,896 --> 01:19:53,260
我是来拍电影的啦
It's for the
goddamn movie, man.

1211
01:19:56,863 --> 01:19:59,523
这个城市很美，哈利
It is a nice town, Harry.

1212
01:20:00,530 --> 01:20:03,018
很高兴我能看得到
I'm glad I got to see it.

1213
01:20:06,729 --> 01:20:08,063
我不是故意笑你
I didn't mean to be
taking the piss out of it

1214
01:20:08,063 --> 01:20:10,495
说这里像童话故事
being a fairytale place.

1215
01:20:10,896 --> 01:20:13,530
这里真的很像童话故事
It is a fairytale place.

1216
01:20:13,530 --> 01:20:15,396
真的很像
It really is.
Hmm.

1217
01:20:15,396 --> 01:20:17,096
可惜是在比利时
It's just a shame
it's in Belgium, really.

1218
01:20:17,096 --> 01:20:19,063
但若不是在比利时
But then you figure
if it wasn't in Belgium,

1219
01:20:19,063 --> 01:20:20,597
而是在什么好地方
if it was somewhere good,

1220
01:20:20,597 --> 01:20:22,363
就会有很多人来看
there'd be too many people
coming to see it. 

1221
01:20:22,363 --> 01:20:24,794
把美景都给毁了
It would
spoil the whole thing.

1222
01:20:27,263 --> 01:20:29,956
很高兴我能看得到
Well, I'm glad
I got to see it

1223
01:20:31,330 --> 01:20:33,626
在我死前
before I died.

1224
01:20:39,963 --> 01:20:42,054
你要干嘛?
What are you doing?

1225
01:20:42,196 --> 01:20:44,129
你到底他妈的想干嘛?
What are you
fucking doing?

1226
01:20:44,129 --> 01:20:46,527
我不想再反抗了
I'm not fighting
anymore, Harry.

1227
01:20:46,929 --> 01:20:49,861
好吧，那我他妈的就轰烂你的脑袋
All right, then I'm blowing
your fucking head off.

1228
01:20:51,963 --> 01:20:53,597
别学甘地搞和平了
Don't come over all Gandhi.

1229
01:20:53,597 --> 01:20:55,824
你他妈的要干嘛?
What are you fucking doing?

1230
01:20:57,463 --> 01:21:00,029
请你别闹了，把枪拿起来
Ken, stop messing
about, please.

1231
01:21:00,029 --> 01:21:02,096
我知道我横竖要揍你，因为…
Pick up your gun.
I know I'm going
to beat you anyway

1232
01:21:02,096 --> 01:21:05,530
哈利…
'Cause you're a spaz, but...
Harry,

1233
01:21:05,530 --> 01:21:08,155
我欠你人情
I'm totally in your debt.

1234
01:21:10,497 --> 01:21:13,486
你过去对我的恩情
The things that have
gone between us in the past,

1235
01:21:14,263 --> 01:21:16,129
我感激你一辈子
I love you
unreservedly
for all that.

1236
01:21:16,129 --> 01:21:17,992
什么?
What?

1237
01:21:18,263 --> 01:21:20,660
你的正直
For your integrity.

1238
01:21:20,963 --> 01:21:23,327
你的荣誉感
For your honor.

1239
01:21:23,463 --> 01:21:25,860
我爱你
I love you.

1240
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:30,921
我非放他走不可
The boy had to be let go.

1241
01:21:32,063 --> 01:21:34,963
要给他一次机会
The boy had to be
given a chance.

1242
01:21:34,963 --> 01:21:36,696
如果放过他
And if to do that,

1243
01:21:36,696 --> 01:21:38,729
就表示我背叛你
I had to say, 

1244
01:21:38,729 --> 01:21:40,563
不顾你对我的恩情
" Fuck you,
and fuck what I owe you,

1245
01:21:40,563 --> 01:21:42,430
不顾我们之间的过去
"and fuck everything
that's gone on between us,"

1246
01:21:42,430 --> 01:21:45,123
那我还是非做不可
then that's what I had to do.

1247
01:21:45,662 --> 01:21:48,561
但我不会反抗你
But I'm not fighting you.

1248
01:21:49,330 --> 01:21:51,263
不管你怎么做我都接受
And I accept, totally,
everything you've got to do.

1249
01:21:51,263 --> 01:21:53,990
我完全接受
I accept it. Totally.

1250
01:21:57,063 --> 01:21:59,256
是吗?
Oh, yeah?

1251
01:22:00,629 --> 01:22:02,357
对
Yeah.

1252
01:22:06,796 --> 01:22:08,530
你他妈的说了这些话就
Well, you say all that
fucking stuff, 

1253
01:22:08,530 --> 01:22:11,257
我他妈的我不能杀你了
I can't
fucking shoot you now, can I?

1254
01:22:12,762 --> 01:22:15,296
由你决定，哈利
It's entirely
up to you, Harry.

1255
01:22:15,296 --> 01:22:17,727
由你决定
It's entirely your call.

1256
01:22:18,796 --> 01:22:20,896
我只想说…
All I'm saying is

1257
01:22:20,896 --> 01:22:23,192
我不反抗了
I'm not fighting.

1258
01:22:29,729 --> 01:22:30,896
你他妈的这个王八蛋！
Oh, you fucking cunt!

1259
01:22:30,896 --> 01:22:32,196
你像罗伯包尔一样站在那儿
Look, I'm not gonna
do nothing to you

1260
01:22:32,196 --> 01:22:35,060
我就不会对你怎样吗?
just 'Cause you're
standing about like
Robert fucking Powell.

1261
01:22:36,729 --> 01:22:37,296
像谁?
Like who?

1262
01:22:37,296 --> 01:22:40,196
拿撒勒的耶稣里的罗伯包尔
Like Robert fucking Powell out of Jesus of
fucking Nazareth!

1263
01:22:40,196 --> 01:22:42,096
我的腿！
My fucking leg!

1264
01:22:42,096 --> 01:22:46,063
疯子侏儒变成可爱的小学生了
The psycho dwarf
turns out to just be
a loveable little schoolboy,

1265
01:22:46,063 --> 01:22:48,696
像波许画作中的噩梦一样
and it's all some kind of
Boschian nightmare.

1266
01:22:48,696 --> 01:22:50,396
去你的！
Kiss my ass!

1267
01:22:50,396 --> 01:22:54,351
至少和黑人无关吧，吉米?
I guess at least there
weren't any black people
involved, eh, Jimmy?

1268
01:22:55,629 --> 01:22:57,829
我不是…
I wasn't...

1269
01:22:57,829 --> 01:23:00,522
我指的不是…
I wasn't talking about...

1270
01:23:01,163 --> 01:23:04,163
黑人和白人之间要开战了
There's gonna be a war
between all the blacks
and all the whites.

1271
01:23:04,163 --> 01:23:06,929
黑人侏儒和白人侏儒也要开战
And all the black midgets
and all the white midgets,

1272
01:23:06,929 --> 01:23:08,296
这下可精彩了
which would actually
be really good.

1273
01:23:08,296 --> 01:23:10,096
我是嗑药乱讲的啦
That's just cocaine.

1274
01:23:10,096 --> 01:23:12,562
他不要和越南人同一阵营
He didn't even want
the Vietnamese on his side!

1275
01:23:12,562 --> 01:23:15,762
我是嗑药乱讲的啦
That's just cocaine.

1276
01:23:15,762 --> 01:23:19,562
我们今晚要去尖顶建筑拍片
Listen, we're filming
down by the pointy
building tonight.

1277
01:23:19,562 --> 01:23:22,085
搞不好这次会很顺利
It might actually be
good for once.

1278
01:23:23,330 --> 01:23:25,396
欢迎你们来看
You guys should come along.

1279
01:23:25,396 --> 01:23:27,129
我们…
We... 

1280
01:23:27,129 --> 01:23:30,696
我们今晚想安静地独处
I think we're just
gonna have a quiet one
tonight, Jimmy.

1281
01:23:30,696 --> 01:23:34,220
原来如此啊
That's how it is!

1282
01:23:36,029 --> 01:23:38,325
下辈子吧
In another life.

1283
01:23:44,363 --> 01:23:46,760
侏儒很棒吧?
They're great,
aren't they?

1284
01:24:01,729 --> 01:24:02,529
你有啦
You didn't. 

1285
01:24:02,963 --> 01:24:04,588
你有
You didn't!

1286
01:24:52,829 --> 01:24:54,296
华特斯先生?
Mr. Waters? 

1287
01:24:54,296 --> 01:24:56,159
华特斯先生?
Mr. Waters?

1288
01:24:57,629 --> 01:24:59,263
你是谁?
Who's that?

1289
01:24:59,263 --> 01:25:01,354
我是艾瑞克
It's Eirik.

1290
01:25:01,596 --> 01:25:02,829
瞎了眼的那个?
The blind boy?

1291
01:25:02,829 --> 01:25:04,852
对
Yeah.

1292
01:25:05,063 --> 01:25:06,824
对
Yes.

1293
01:25:07,129 --> 01:25:09,395
你他妈的要干嘛?
What do you fucking want?

1294
01:25:09,395 --> 01:25:12,759
你在找的那雷蒙
The guy you're looking for,the guy Ray,

1295
01:25:12,896 --> 01:25:15,521
他在楼下的酒吧
he's downstairs
at the bar.

1296
01:25:50,562 --> 01:25:53,230
对不起，肯尼
I'm sorry, Ken.

1297
01:25:53,230 --> 01:25:57,685
但杀死小孩就不能苟活在世上
But you can't kill
a kid and expect to
get away with it.

1298
01:25:58,729 --> 01:26:00,854
就是不行
You just can't.

1299
01:26:15,729 --> 01:26:16,395
在哪里?
Where?

1300
01:26:16,395 --> 01:26:18,263
下去之后往左边
To the left when you come out.

1301
01:26:18,263 --> 01:26:20,286
在左边的酒吧
The bar to the left.

1302
01:26:47,762 --> 01:26:56,457
在秋日的雷格伦路上
(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)

1303
01:26:57,029 --> 01:27:01,063
我先看到她

1304
01:27:01,063 --> 01:27:04,629
我知道…

1305
01:27:04,629 --> 01:27:13,729
她的黑发会编成陷阱

1306
01:27:13,729 --> 01:27:20,628
也许我将来会懊悔

1307
01:27:20,929 --> 01:27:28,885
我看到危险也躲过了

1308
01:27:29,129 --> 01:27:35,652
在美不胜收的路上

1309
01:27:35,929 --> 01:27:39,896
我说过让悲伤

1310
01:27:39,896 --> 01:27:43,596
像落叶似地飘落

1311
01:27:43,596 --> 01:27:52,018
在一天的开始

1312
01:27:52,596 --> 01:27:59,963
11月天在葛拉夫顿街上

1313
01:27:59,963 --> 01:28:07,327
我们在深峻的峡谷

1314
01:28:07,729 --> 01:28:15,096
轻步走在岩棚的边缘

1315
01:28:15,096 --> 01:28:21,329
热情价值有多高

1316
01:28:21,329 --> 01:28:28,129
红心女王还在做馅饼

1317
01:28:28,129 --> 01:28:34,929
我没什么收获

1318
01:28:34,929 --> 01:28:38,963
我爱得太深

1319
01:28:38,963 --> 01:28:42,929
就这样…

1320
01:28:42,929 --> 01:28:50,487
抛弃了幸福

1321
01:28:51,163 --> 01:28:55,963
当天使求爱时

1322
01:28:55,963 --> 01:29:00,096
他将惨遭滑铁卢

1323
01:29:00,096 --> 01:29:12,154
他的双翼在黎明时分

1324
01:29:37,195 --> 01:29:38,456
肯尼?
Ken!

1325
01:29:39,929 --> 01:29:41,063
肯尼！
Ken! 

1326
01:29:41,063 --> 01:29:43,290
肯尼！
Ken!

1327
01:29:45,128 --> 01:29:47,356
哈利来了
Harry's here.

1328
01:29:47,863 --> 01:29:50,056
什么?
What?

1329
01:29:51,262 --> 01:29:53,996
拿着…
Take

1330
01:29:53,996 --> 01:29:56,393
…我的枪
my gun.

1331
01:30:08,762 --> 01:30:10,929
肯尼?
Ken?

1332
01:30:10,929 --> 01:30:12,986
我的枪呢?
Where's my gun?

1333
01:30:14,462 --> 01:30:16,826
我的枪呢?
Where's my gun?

1334
01:30:19,095 --> 01:30:21,729
我要死了
I'm gonna die now, 

1335
01:30:21,729 --> 01:30:23,661
应该吧
I think.

1336
01:30:24,262 --> 01:30:26,558
肯尼！
Oh, Ken!

1337
01:30:27,562 --> 01:30:29,494
天哪！
Jesus!

1338
01:32:36,295 --> 01:32:37,896
布雷克利先生说你走了
Mr. Blakely said
you had left.

1339
01:32:37,896 --> 01:32:39,128
快给我房间的钥匙
I need the key
to the room right now.

1340
01:32:39,128 --> 01:32:40,890
快点！马上给我！
Quickly, now!

1341
01:32:41,629 --> 01:32:43,629
你快回家，这里非常危险
And you gotta go
home right now. It's very,
very dangerous here.

1342
01:32:43,629 --> 01:32:43,962
好
All right?

1343
01:32:43,962 --> 01:32:44,962
回家去！快点！
 Go home!
Right now!

1344
01:32:44,962 --> 01:32:46,087
好
Okay.

1345
01:32:57,229 --> 01:33:00,389
(肯尼的旅馆)

1346
01:33:26,095 --> 01:33:28,323
(我的遗嘱)

1347
01:33:30,262 --> 01:33:32,295
不行，我不能让你上去
MARIE: No, I won't let you
up there! 

1348
01:33:32,295 --> 01:33:34,496
马上把枪收起来
Put that
gun away, right now!

1349
01:33:34,496 --> 01:33:35,995
小姐，请你让开
HARRY: Lady, get out of
my fucking way, please.

1350
01:33:35,995 --> 01:33:37,529
我不要
No, I won't. 

1351
01:33:37,529 --> 01:33:39,722
我不要让开
I won't
get out of your way.

1352
01:33:40,162 --> 01:33:41,895
你要先通过我这一关
You'll have to
go through me.

1353
01:33:41,895 --> 01:33:44,596
我不能对你怎样，你身怀六甲
Well, obviously,
I'm not gonna through you,
am I, with a baby and that?

1354
01:33:44,596 --> 01:33:48,050
我是好人，但请你让开好吗?
I'm a nice person.
But could you just get out
of the fucking way, please?

1355
01:33:53,696 --> 01:33:55,491
玛莉?
Marie!

1356
01:33:55,796 --> 01:33:58,162
让他上来，没关系
Just let him
come up, it's okay.

1357
01:33:58,162 --> 01:33:59,329
哈利?
Harry, 

1358
01:33:59,329 --> 01:34:01,529
请发誓你会等她走出旅馆再开枪
swear not to
start shooting until
she's left the hotel.

1359
01:34:01,529 --> 01:34:04,095
我会等她走出旅馆再开枪
I swear not to start shooting
till she's left the hotel.

1360
01:34:04,095 --> 01:34:04,995
我对天发誓
I totally swear.

1361
01:34:04,995 --> 01:34:07,120
我哪儿也不去
Well, I'm not
going anywhere.

1362
01:34:07,596 --> 01:34:09,762
这是我的旅馆
This is my hotel.

1363
01:34:09,762 --> 01:34:12,125
请你滚！
So you can fuck off!

1364
01:34:24,162 --> 01:34:26,262
你应该有枪吧?
I suppose you've got
a gun up there?

1365
01:34:26,262 --> 01:34:27,989
有
Yeah.

1366
01:34:28,329 --> 01:34:31,028
怎么办?不能在这里站一整夜啊
Then what are we gonna do?
We can't stand here all night.

1367
01:34:31,028 --> 01:34:34,128
你们俩都把枪放下回家去吧
Why don't you both
put your guns down
and go home?

1368
01:34:34,128 --> 01:34:36,162
别傻了
Don't be stupid.

1369
01:34:36,162 --> 01:34:38,560
我们要枪战
This is the shootout.

1370
01:34:38,895 --> 01:34:40,229
哈利?
Harry, 

1371
01:34:40,229 --> 01:34:41,229
我有个办法
I've got an idea.

1372
01:34:41,229 --> 01:34:42,062
什么办法?
What?

1373
01:34:42,062 --> 01:34:44,362
我的房间是面对运河的
My room faces
onto the canal, right?

1374
01:34:44,362 --> 01:34:47,262
我现在回房间，跳进运河
I'm gonna go back to me room,
jump into the canal,

1375
01:34:47,262 --> 01:34:49,395
看看我能不能游到对岸逃走
see if I can swim
to the other side
and escape.

1376
01:34:49,395 --> 01:34:49,862
好
Right.

1377
01:34:49,862 --> 01:34:51,696
你现在走出去，绕过街角
If you go outside
and round the corner,

1378
01:34:51,696 --> 01:34:53,995
从那里开枪，想办法抓到我
you can shoot at me
from there and try
and get me.

1379
01:34:53,995 --> 01:34:56,562
这样就不会伤到他们母女了
That way, we leave this lady
and her baby out of
the whole, entire thing.

1380
01:34:56,562 --> 01:34:58,995
你真的会跳进运河吗?
Do you completely promise
to jump into the canal?

1381
01:34:58,995 --> 01:35:00,795
我不想跑出去10分钟后回来
I don't want to
run out there,
come back in 10 minutes

1382
01:35:00,795 --> 01:35:02,496
发现你他妈的躲在碗橱里
and find you fucking
hiding in a cupboard.

1383
01:35:02,496 --> 01:35:04,028
我跟你保证
I completely promise, Harry.

1384
01:35:04,028 --> 01:35:06,229
我不想再害死另一个小孩
I'm not gonna risk
having another
little kid die, am I?

1385
01:35:06,229 --> 01:35:10,429
等一下，我出去要左转还右转?
So, hang on, I go outside,
then I go which way,
right or left?

1386
01:35:10,429 --> 01:35:12,062
你要右转
You go right,
don't you?

1387
01:35:12,062 --> 01:35:15,062
站在门口就看得到，他妈的运河很大
You can see it
from the doorway!
It's a big fucking canal!

1388
01:35:15,062 --> 01:35:18,095
好啦！真是的！我才刚来嘛！
All right. Jesus!
I've only just
got here, haven't I?

1389
01:35:18,095 --> 01:35:20,962
好，数到3就开始动作
Okay. On a count of
"one, two, three, go," okay?

1390
01:35:20,962 --> 01:35:22,860
好
Okay.

1391
01:35:28,095 --> 01:35:29,529
怎样?谁来数?
What? Who says it?

1392
01:35:29,529 --> 01:35:30,862
你来数
Oh, you say it.

1393
01:35:30,862 --> 01:35:32,895
你们都疯了
You guys are crazy.

1394
01:35:32,895 --> 01:35:33,529
准备好了吗?
Are you ready?

1395
01:35:33,529 --> 01:35:34,362
好了
Ready.

1396
01:35:34,362 --> 01:35:34,795
预备?
Set?

1397
01:35:34,795 --> 01:35:35,995
预备
Set.

1398
01:35:35,995 --> 01:35:37,790
1，2，3，开始！
One, two, three, go!

1399
01:35:51,895 --> 01:35:53,918
继续开船
Keep driving!

1400
01:36:00,395 --> 01:36:03,418
不可能，你距离太远了
No way. You're way
too far away.

1401
01:38:05,529 --> 01:38:07,229
小男孩
The little boy.

1402
01:38:07,229 --> 01:38:09,252
对，雷蒙
That's right, Ray.

1403
01:38:09,429 --> 01:38:11,418
小男孩
The little boy.

1404
01:39:19,962 --> 01:39:22,019
我懂了
I see.

1405
01:39:27,795 --> 01:39:29,761
哈利，别开枪
No, Harry.

1406
01:39:30,528 --> 01:39:34,528
他不是…
He's not...

1407
01:39:34,528 --> 01:39:37,585
做人要坚守原则
You've got to stick
to your principles.

1408
01:40:03,561 --> 01:40:07,262
伦敦有棵圣诞树底下堆满了礼物
RAY. ; There's a Christmas tree
somewhere in London with a bunch of presents

1409
01:40:07,262 --> 01:40:09,455
永远不会被拆开
underneath it that'll
never be opened.

1410
01:40:09,995 --> 01:40:12,462
我想只要我能活下去
And I thought,
"If I survive all this,

1411
01:40:12,462 --> 01:40:14,095
我就要回去那个家
I'll go to that house,

1412
01:40:14,095 --> 01:40:15,761
向我的母亲道歉
"apologize to
the mother there,

1413
01:40:15,761 --> 01:40:18,784
不管她要怎么惩罚我都接受
"and accept whatever
punishment she chose for me."

1414
01:40:19,295 --> 01:40:20,895
监狱
Prison, 

1415
01:40:20,895 --> 01:40:23,962
死亡，都无所谓
death,
it didn't matter.

1416
01:40:23,962 --> 01:40:25,828
因为至少坐牢和死掉
Because at least in prison
and at least in death,
you know,

1417
01:40:25,828 --> 01:40:29,885
我都不会在他妈的布鲁日
I wouldn't be
in fucking Bruges.

1418
01:40:32,295 --> 01:40:35,495
但种种景象掠过我眼前
But then, like a flash,
it came to me, 

1419
01:40:35,495 --> 01:40:38,595
我才发觉…
and I realized,

1420
01:40:38,595 --> 01:40:42,153
靠！也许这就是地狱
"Fuck, man, maybe
that's what Hell is.

1421
01:40:42,828 --> 01:40:46,658
他妈的在布鲁日待到天荒地老
"The entire rest of eternity
spent in fucking Bruges!"

1422
01:40:51,095 --> 01:40:53,890
我真的很希望我不会死
And I really, really
hoped I wouldn't die.

1423
01:40:56,395 --> 01:40:59,259
我真的很希望我不会死
I really, really
hoped I wouldn't die.
