1
00:00:56,291 --> 00:01:00,211
<i>After I killed them,
I dropped the gun in the Thames,</i>

2
00:01:00,311 --> 00:01:03,479
<i>washed the residue off me hands
in the bathroom of a Burger King,</i>

3
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:06,193
<i>and walked home
to await instructions.</i>

4
00:01:07,235 --> 00:01:10,432
<i>Shortly thereafter,
the instructions came through.</i>

5
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:14,257
<i>'Get the fuck out of London,
youse dumb fucks.</i>

6
00:01:14,357 --> 00:01:15,934
<i>'Get to Bruges:'</i>

7
00:01:17,512 --> 00:01:20,413
<i>I didn't even know
where Bruges fucking was.</i>

8
00:01:24,452 --> 00:01:26,044
<i>It's in Belgium.</i>

9
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:30,736
<i>Bruges is a shithole.</i>

10
00:01:30,836 --> 00:01:32,175
<i>Bruges is
not a shithole.</i>

11
00:01:32,275 --> 00:01:33,273
<i>Bruges is a shithole.</i>

12
00:01:33,373 --> 00:01:35,341
<i>Ray, we've only just
got off the fucking train.</i>

13
00:01:35,441 --> 00:01:38,315
<i>Could we reserve judgment on Bruges
until we've seen the fucking place?</i>

14
00:01:38,415 --> 00:01:39,957
<i>I know it's gonna be
a shithole.</i>

15
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:09,691
Shithole.

16
00:02:15,136 --> 00:02:19,455
I think you have a couple of rooms
booked under Cranham and Blakely?

17
00:02:19,555 --> 00:02:22,737
Yes. No, we have one room booked.

18
00:02:23,378 --> 00:02:25,846
One twin room.
Booked for two weeks.

19
00:02:26,714 --> 00:02:28,079
Two weeks!

20
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,864
Do you have another room?

21
00:02:29,964 --> 00:02:31,498
No, I'm afraid we're fully booked.

22
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:34,521
With Christmas,
everywhere is fully booked.

23
00:02:35,456 --> 00:02:36,604
Okay.

24
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,547
It's very pretty.

25
00:02:43,647 --> 00:02:45,144
I'm not being funny,
we can't stay here.

26
00:02:45,244 --> 00:02:47,117
We've got to stay here
until he rings.

27
00:02:47,217 --> 00:02:48,551
Well, what if he doesn't
ring for two weeks?

28
00:02:48,651 --> 00:02:50,251
Then we stay here for two weeks.

29
00:02:50,351 --> 00:02:54,123
For two weeks? In fucking Bruges?
In a room like this?

30
00:02:54,223 --> 00:02:55,835
With you? No way!

31
00:02:55,943 --> 00:02:58,626
Ray, I really don't like to say this.

32
00:02:58,726 --> 00:03:01,064
You really don't like to say what?

33
00:03:01,164 --> 00:03:02,878
Well. You know?

34
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,285
Fucking bring that up.

35
00:03:43,725 --> 00:03:45,975
Do you think this is good?

36
00:03:46,075 --> 00:03:48,074
Do I think what's good?

37
00:03:48,174 --> 00:03:51,359
You know, going round in a boat,
looking at stuff.

38
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:53,931
Yes, I do.

39
00:03:55,503 --> 00:03:57,528
It's called 'sightseeing.'

40
00:04:07,348 --> 00:04:08,975
Oh, look at that.

41
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:15,844
It's a former hospital.
From the 1100s.

42
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,212
Bruges is the most
well-preserved medieval town

43
00:04:21,312 --> 00:04:23,695
in the whole of
Belgium, apparently.

44
00:04:45,653 --> 00:04:47,985
Coming up?
What's up there?

45
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,705
The view.

46
00:04:50,805 --> 00:04:54,544
The view of what?
The view of down here?
I can see that from down here.

47
00:04:54,644 --> 00:04:58,948
Ray, you're about
the worst tourist in the whole world.

48
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:02,419
Ken, I grew up in Dublin.
I love Dublin.

49
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:06,153
If I'd grown up on a farm and was
retarded, Bruges might impress me.

50
00:05:06,253 --> 00:05:08,367
But I didn't, so it doesn't.

51
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:23,103
Trying to get rid of me coins.

52
00:05:23,203 --> 00:05:26,239
3, 3.50, 4,

53
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:31,811
4.10, 4.20, 4.30,
4.40, 4.50, 4.60,

54
00:05:31,911 --> 00:05:34,116
4.70,

55
00:05:34,216 --> 00:05:35,726
4.80,

56
00:05:37,138 --> 00:05:38,935
4.90.

57
00:05:41,242 --> 00:05:43,458
Will you take 4.90?

58
00:05:43,558 --> 00:05:45,444
Entry is 5 euro.

59
00:05:46,781 --> 00:05:49,098
Come on, man,
it's only 10 cents.

60
00:05:49,198 --> 00:05:50,548
Entry is 5 euro.

61
00:06:01,963 --> 00:06:03,313
Happy in your work?

62
00:06:03,413 --> 00:06:04,421
Very happy.

63
00:06:40,735 --> 00:06:42,259
I like it here.

64
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:12,549
Been to the top of the tower?

65
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:16,114
Yeah. Yeah, it's rubbish.

66
00:07:16,214 --> 00:07:19,263
It is? The guidebook says
it's a 'must-see'.

67
00:07:20,341 --> 00:07:22,821
Well, you lot ain't going up there.

68
00:07:22,921 --> 00:07:24,490
Pardon me? Why?

69
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:28,498
I mean, it's all windy stairs.
I'm not being funny.

70
00:07:28,598 --> 00:07:31,073
What exactly are you
trying to say?

71
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:33,800
What exactly
am I trying to say?

72
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,273
Youse are a bunch
of fucking elephants!

73
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:37,847
Right, you.

74
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:47,123
Come on, leave it, fatty.

75
00:07:56,711 --> 00:08:00,078
You know, you're just
the rudest man. The rudest man!

76
00:08:01,782 --> 00:08:03,647
What's all that about?

77
00:08:04,719 --> 00:08:06,035
They're not going up there.

78
00:08:06,135 --> 00:08:09,540
Hey, guys, I wouldn't go up there.
It's really narrow.

79
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,648
Screw you, motherfucker!

80
00:08:14,996 --> 00:08:16,827
Americans, isn't it?

81
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:24,753
Now, this is more like it.
Proper holidays.

82
00:08:24,853 --> 00:08:26,352
One gay beer
for my gay friend,

83
00:08:26,452 --> 00:08:29,089
and one normal beer for me,
because I am normal.

84
00:08:30,277 --> 00:08:31,695
This is the life.

85
00:08:31,795 --> 00:08:34,373
We're not staying here getting pissed.

86
00:08:34,782 --> 00:08:36,632
We are quietly sightseeing,
like he says,

87
00:08:36,732 --> 00:08:39,366
and awaiting his call
to see what we do next.

88
00:08:39,466 --> 00:08:41,371
This is my vote
on what we should do.

89
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:44,049
We give it another day,
two days, max.

90
00:08:44,592 --> 00:08:46,943
Then we check the papers again,
and if there's still nothing in them,

91
00:08:47,043 --> 00:08:50,279
we phone him and say, 'Harry,
thank you for the trip to Bruges,

92
00:08:50,379 --> 00:08:52,783
'it's been very nice, all the
old buildings and that,

93
00:08:52,883 --> 00:08:55,583
'but we're coming back to London now,
and hide out in a proper country,

94
00:08:55,683 --> 00:08:57,919
'where it isn't all just
fucking chocolates.'

95
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:01,497
My vote would be
we quietly sightsee, like he says,

96
00:09:02,176 --> 00:09:05,009
and await his call
to see what we do next.

97
00:09:08,049 --> 00:09:10,779
You don't even know
we're here hiding out.

98
00:09:12,486 --> 00:09:13,937
What are you talking about?

99
00:09:14,037 --> 00:09:16,305
You don't even know
we're not here on a job.

100
00:09:16,405 --> 00:09:18,404
- What, on a job?
- Yeah.

101
00:09:18,504 --> 00:09:20,005
- Here in Bruges?
- Yeah.

102
00:09:20,105 --> 00:09:22,494
- Here in Bruges, on a job?
- Yeah.

103
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,912
Why? What did he actually say?

104
00:09:25,012 --> 00:09:26,416
He didn't actually say anything.

105
00:09:26,516 --> 00:09:29,386
- Then why do you think it might be?
- I don't think anything.

106
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:32,423
But it's a bit fucking
over-elaborate, isn't it?

107
00:09:32,523 --> 00:09:35,020
- 'Go take him to hide out.'
- 'Go take him to hide out where?'

108
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,010
'Go take him to hide out
in fucking Bruges.'

109
00:09:39,447 --> 00:09:41,574
You can hide out in Croydon.

110
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:43,906
Hmm.

111
00:09:45,086 --> 00:09:46,485
Or Coventry.

112
00:09:48,856 --> 00:09:49,845
Hmm.

113
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:54,152
It is a bit over-elaborate.

114
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:57,252
Hmm.

115
00:09:58,532 --> 00:09:59,882
But we haven't got any guns.

116
00:09:59,982 --> 00:10:02,265
Harry can get guns anywhere.

117
00:10:24,558 --> 00:10:26,685
He's not gonna ring tonight.

118
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,493
He's not gonna ring tonight.

119
00:10:37,071 --> 00:10:38,584
Let's go out.

120
00:10:38,684 --> 00:10:40,590
- Go out where?
- The pub.

121
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:41,698
No!

122
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:02,012
Let's go out and have a look
at some of the...

123
00:11:02,112 --> 00:11:04,745
All the old medieval
buildings and that.

124
00:11:04,845 --> 00:11:08,393
Because I bet they look even
better at night, all lit up.

125
00:11:12,907 --> 00:11:13,965
Yes!

126
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:26,431
That there is called
the Gruuthuse Museum.

127
00:11:26,531 --> 00:11:28,568
They all have funny names,
don't they?

128
00:11:28,668 --> 00:11:30,146
Yes, Flemish.

129
00:11:31,325 --> 00:11:34,143
In here it says, 'The Belgians
twice sheltered fugitive English Kings

130
00:11:34,243 --> 00:11:37,114
'from being murdered, 1471 and 1651.'

131
00:11:37,214 --> 00:11:39,515
I used to hate history,
didn't you?

132
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,985
It's all just a load of stuff
that's already happened.

133
00:11:42,085 --> 00:11:43,987
What are they doing over there?

134
00:11:44,087 --> 00:11:46,699
They're filming something.
They're filming midgets!

135
00:11:48,242 --> 00:11:49,368
Ray!

136
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:56,574
So, on this scene, you're supposed
to walk like a little, tiny mouse, yeah?

137
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:01,855
Okay? Great.

138
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:06,409
Ray, come on, let's go.

139
00:12:06,509 --> 00:12:09,326
My arse, 'Let's go.'
They're filming midgets.

140
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:13,948
Oh, my God!
Look at that girl.

141
00:12:14,048 --> 00:12:15,547
She's gorgeous!

142
00:12:15,647 --> 00:12:16,817
Ray, we're going right now.

143
00:12:16,917 --> 00:12:18,383
Fuck off, are we!

144
00:12:18,483 --> 00:12:22,306
This is the best bit of Bruges
so far. You and your buildings.

145
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:47,994
Hello.

146
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:53,332
Do you speak English?
No.

147
00:12:54,642 --> 00:12:57,358
Yes, you do.
Everybody does.

148
00:12:57,458 --> 00:13:00,060
What are you filming midgets for?

149
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,514
It's a Dutch movie.
It's a dream sequence.

150
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:06,936
<i>It's a pastiche of Nicholas Roeg's
Don't Look Now.</i>

151
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,989
Not a pastiche, but a...

152
00:13:10,057 --> 00:13:13,584
A 'homage' is too strong.
A 'nod of the head'?

153
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:18,294
Wow, your English is very good.

154
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:25,666
A lot of midgets
tend to kill themselves.

155
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:30,439
A disproportionate amount.

156
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:34,003
<i>Hervé Villechaize,
off of Fantasy Island.</i>

157
00:13:35,316 --> 00:13:38,100
<i>I think somebody
off The Time Bandits.</i>

158
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,450
I suppose they must
get really sad about, like,

159
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,539
being really little and that.

160
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,207
People looking at them
and laughing at them.

161
00:13:47,307 --> 00:13:50,559
Calling them names.
You know, 'shortarse.'

162
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:56,292
There's another famous
midget I'm missing,
but I can't remember.

163
00:13:57,471 --> 00:14:00,269
It's not the R2-D2 man.
No, he's still going.

164
00:14:01,642 --> 00:14:06,272
I hope your midget doesn't kill himself.
Your dream sequence will be fucked.

165
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,461
He doesn't like being called a midget.
He prefers 'dwarf.'

166
00:14:09,561 --> 00:14:11,935
Well, this is exactly my point!

167
00:14:12,035 --> 00:14:15,135
People go around calling you a midget
when you want to be called a dwarf.

168
00:14:15,235 --> 00:14:18,055
Of course you're
gonna blow your head off!

169
00:14:19,827 --> 00:14:22,523
- My name's Ray. What's yours?
- Chloe.

170
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:26,680
How did you get past
the security man?

171
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:30,085
Getting past security men,
it's sort of my job.

172
00:14:30,185 --> 00:14:31,121
You're a shoplifter?

173
00:14:31,221 --> 00:14:33,252
No, not a shoplifter.

174
00:14:33,352 --> 00:14:35,308
It's a good joke, though.

175
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,436
No.

176
00:14:38,212 --> 00:14:40,996
I'll tell you what I am
at dinner tomorrow night.

177
00:14:57,231 --> 00:14:58,391
Fuck.

178
00:15:11,412 --> 00:15:13,209
How fucking cool.

179
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,074
Mr. Blakely?

180
00:15:26,174 --> 00:15:29,857
- Yes. No, Mr. Cranham.
- No. Yes. Mr. Blakely. Yes.

181
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:34,631
You have a message.

182
00:15:39,907 --> 00:15:40,999
Shit!

183
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:45,059
<i>Number one, why aren't you
in when I fucking told you to be in?</i>

184
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:48,261
<i>Number two, why doesn't this hotel
have phones with fucking voicemail</i>

185
00:15:48,361 --> 00:15:51,099
<i>and not I have to leave messages
with the fucking receptionist?</i>

186
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,070
<i>Number three, you better fucking be in
tomorrow night when I fucking call again</i>

187
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:58,284
<i>or there'll be fucking Hell to pay,
I'm fucking telling you, Harry.</i>

188
00:16:35,562 --> 00:16:38,014
Would you turn
the fucking light off!

189
00:16:38,114 --> 00:16:39,611
Sorry, Ken.

190
00:16:39,711 --> 00:16:41,827
Keep the fucking noise down!

191
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:46,768
Someone's in a mood.

192
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:02,301
You'll never guess what.

193
00:17:02,401 --> 00:17:04,470
Will you shut your fucking mouth,
please, and go to sleep?

194
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:06,219
Oh, sorry.

195
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:13,723
Except I've gotta take me
contact lenses out.

196
00:17:20,841 --> 00:17:22,292
Altogether,

197
00:17:22,392 --> 00:17:23,843
I had

198
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:28,079
five pints of beer
and six bottles.

199
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:33,868
No. Six pints of beer
and seven bottles.

200
00:17:33,968 --> 00:17:36,582
And you know what?
I'm not even pissed!

201
00:17:42,496 --> 00:17:44,691
You'll never guess what, Ken.

202
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:48,481
- Ken, you'll never guess what.
- What?

203
00:17:48,581 --> 00:17:49,683
Got a date for tomorrow night.

204
00:17:49,783 --> 00:17:50,850
I'm very happy for you.

205
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,052
With a girl.

206
00:17:52,152 --> 00:17:53,401
Can you turn
the light off, please?

207
00:17:53,507 --> 00:17:56,359
Only been in Bruges one day, got a date
with a girl in the film business,

208
00:17:56,459 --> 00:17:58,502
the Belgian film business.

209
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,305
They're doing a film about a midget.

210
00:18:20,701 --> 00:18:21,793
Miss?

211
00:18:22,636 --> 00:18:23,796
Marie?

212
00:18:27,074 --> 00:18:31,477
Sorry about the message last night.
The man who left it is a bit of a...

213
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:34,937
Well, he's a bit of a...

214
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:36,641
Cock?

215
00:18:37,818 --> 00:18:39,843
Yes. He's a bit of a cock.

216
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:44,351
Morning.

217
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:55,625
Harry called last night.

218
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:57,793
We missed him.

219
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:03,075
Jeez, he swears a lot, doesn't he?

220
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:07,337
We're staying in tonight.
Whatever happens.

221
00:19:07,948 --> 00:19:09,142
Hmm.

222
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:11,815
Except...

223
00:19:14,388 --> 00:19:15,685
Hmm.
Hmm.

224
00:19:15,856 --> 00:19:17,436
Except 'hmm' what?

225
00:19:17,536 --> 00:19:22,277
Except only one of us
needs to stay in, really.

226
00:19:22,377 --> 00:19:23,590
Uh-huh.

227
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:27,814
And which one of us
would that be, now, Ray?

228
00:19:27,914 --> 00:19:29,319
I thought you didn't like Bruges.

229
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:31,186
I don't like Bruges,
it's a shithole.

230
00:19:31,286 --> 00:19:35,057
But I did already say I had a date
with a Belgian lady

231
00:19:35,157 --> 00:19:39,203
in the Belgian film business,
which I did already say about before.

232
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:46,400
Just don't get into
any fucking trouble.

233
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,613
We're keeping a low profile.

234
00:19:49,222 --> 00:19:52,940
And this morning,
and this afternoon,

235
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,377
we are doing what I want to do.

236
00:19:55,477 --> 00:19:57,225
- Got it?
- Of course.

237
00:19:58,098 --> 00:19:59,983
Which, I presume,
will involve culture.

238
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:03,784
Oh, we shall strike a balance
between culture and fun.

239
00:20:03,884 --> 00:20:08,432
Somehow I believe, Ken, that the
balance shall tip in the favor of culture.

240
00:20:09,443 --> 00:20:13,296
Like a big, fat, fucking retarded,
fucking black girl

241
00:20:13,396 --> 00:20:16,076
on a seesaw, opposite

242
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,082
a dwarf.

243
00:20:57,157 --> 00:20:59,739
Ray, did we
or did we not agree

244
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:01,305
that if I let you
go on your date tonight,

245
00:21:01,405 --> 00:21:03,346
we'd do the things
I wanted to do today?

246
00:21:03,446 --> 00:21:05,280
We are doing the things
that you wanted to do today.

247
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,913
And that we'd do them without you
throwing a fucking moody,

248
00:21:08,013 --> 00:21:10,352
like some 5-year-old who's dropped
all his sweets?

249
00:21:10,452 --> 00:21:12,405
I didn't agree to that.

250
00:21:13,206 --> 00:21:15,367
I'll cheer up.
I'll cheer up.

251
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:18,745
Up there, the top altar, is a phial

252
00:21:19,513 --> 00:21:22,994
brought back by a Flemish knight
from the Crusades in the Holy Land.

253
00:21:23,094 --> 00:21:25,665
And that phial, do you know what
it's said to contain?

254
00:21:25,765 --> 00:21:27,299
No, what's it
said to contain?

255
00:21:27,399 --> 00:21:31,335
It's said to contain some drops of
Jesus Christ's blood.

256
00:21:31,435 --> 00:21:35,142
Yeah, that's how this church got
its name. Basilica of the Holy Blood.

257
00:21:35,242 --> 00:21:36,578
Yeah. Yeah.

258
00:21:36,678 --> 00:21:39,530
And this blood, right,
though it's dried blood,

259
00:21:39,633 --> 00:21:43,682
at different times over many years,
they say it turned back into liquid.

260
00:21:43,782 --> 00:21:46,419
Turned back into liquid
from dried blood.

261
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:48,633
At various times of great

262
00:21:50,243 --> 00:21:51,458
stress.

263
00:21:51,558 --> 00:21:52,828
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

264
00:21:52,928 --> 00:21:57,997
So, yeah, I'm gonna go up in the queue
and touch it, which is what you do.

265
00:21:58,097 --> 00:22:00,245
- Yeah?
- Yeah. You coming?

266
00:22:00,788 --> 00:22:02,278
Do I have to?

267
00:22:03,824 --> 00:22:06,743
- Do you have to?
- Of course you don't have to.

268
00:22:06,843 --> 00:22:10,680
It's Jesus' fucking blood, isn't it?
Of course you don't fucking have to!

269
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:13,289
Of course you don't
fucking have to!

270
00:22:57,211 --> 00:22:59,202
You little fucking cunt.

271
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:34,138
<i>Murder, Father.</i>

272
00:23:35,516 --> 00:23:36,813
<i>Why did you
murder someone, Raymond?</i>

273
00:23:39,386 --> 00:23:41,445
For money, Father.

274
00:23:41,855 --> 00:23:43,220
For money?

275
00:23:44,358 --> 00:23:46,242
You murdered someone for money?

276
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:47,315
Yes, Father.

277
00:23:47,428 --> 00:23:50,659
Not out of anger, not out of nothing.
For money.

278
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:55,927
Who did you murder
for money, Raymond?

279
00:23:56,703 --> 00:23:58,102
You, Father.

280
00:24:00,174 --> 00:24:01,321
I'm sorry?

281
00:24:01,421 --> 00:24:04,104
I said you, Father.
What, are you deaf?

282
00:24:04,545 --> 00:24:06,513
Harry Waters says hello.

283
00:24:23,564 --> 00:24:25,395
The little boy.

284
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:14,086
I quite like this one.

285
00:26:14,186 --> 00:26:18,426
All the rest were rubbish by spastics,
but this one's quite good.

286
00:26:18,526 --> 00:26:20,537
What's that all about, then?

287
00:26:21,415 --> 00:26:25,545
- It's Judgment Day, you know?
- Oh, yeah.

288
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:31,069
What's that then?

289
00:26:31,169 --> 00:26:34,252
Well, it's, you know,
the final day on Earth.

290
00:26:34,995 --> 00:26:40,023
When mankind will be judged for all
the crimes they've committed and that.

291
00:26:41,602 --> 00:26:45,022
And see who gets into Heaven and
who gets into Hell and all that?

292
00:26:45,122 --> 00:26:46,151
Yeah.

293
00:26:46,251 --> 00:26:48,022
And what's the other place?

294
00:26:48,122 --> 00:26:49,323
Purgatory.

295
00:26:49,423 --> 00:26:51,659
Purgatory?

296
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:54,827
Purgatory's kind of like
the in-betweeny one.

297
00:26:54,927 --> 00:26:58,908
You weren't really shit, but you
weren't all that great, either.

298
00:26:59,553 --> 00:27:01,077
Like Tottenham.

299
00:27:02,022 --> 00:27:04,474
Do you believe
in all that stuff, Ken?

300
00:27:04,574 --> 00:27:06,037
About Tottenham?

301
00:27:06,137 --> 00:27:08,492
The Last Judgment
and the afterlife.

302
00:27:11,465 --> 00:27:14,457
Guilt and sins and

303
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:18,733
Hell and all that?

304
00:27:21,408 --> 00:27:22,397
Um...

305
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:26,801
Well...

306
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:36,480
I don't know, Ray.
I don't know what I believe.

307
00:27:36,857 --> 00:27:40,305
The things you're taught as a child,
they never really leave you, do they?

308
00:27:40,405 --> 00:27:42,644
So, like, I believe in trying
to lead a good life.

309
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:46,379
Like, if there's an old lady,
carrying her shopping home,

310
00:27:46,479 --> 00:27:50,184
I don't try and help her carry her
shopping, I don't go that far,

311
00:27:50,284 --> 00:27:54,455
but I'll certainly hold
the door open for her and that,
and let her go out before me.

312
00:27:54,555 --> 00:27:56,656
Yeah. And anyway, if you tried to
help her carry her shopping,

313
00:27:56,756 --> 00:27:58,661
she'd probably think you were
just trying to nick her shopping.

314
00:27:58,761 --> 00:28:01,563
Exactly. This is the world
we live in today.

315
00:28:01,663 --> 00:28:04,981
At the same time as trying to lead
a good life,

316
00:28:06,353 --> 00:28:10,687
I have to reconcile myself with the
fact that, yes, I have killed people.

317
00:28:11,658 --> 00:28:15,185
Not many people. Most of them were
not very nice people.

318
00:28:15,729 --> 00:28:17,877
Apart from one person.

319
00:28:17,977 --> 00:28:19,348
Who's that?

320
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:21,851
This fellow,
Danny Aliband's brother.

321
00:28:21,951 --> 00:28:25,383
He was just trying to protect
his brother. Like you or I would.

322
00:28:25,483 --> 00:28:27,756
He was just a lollipop man.

323
00:28:27,856 --> 00:28:31,289
He came at me with a bottle.
What are you gonna do?

324
00:28:31,389 --> 00:28:32,762
I shot him down.

325
00:28:32,862 --> 00:28:33,835
Hmm.

326
00:28:34,548 --> 00:28:38,333
In my book, though, sorry,
someone comes at you with a bottle,

327
00:28:38,433 --> 00:28:40,966
that is a deadly weapon,
he's gotta take the consequences.

328
00:28:41,066 --> 00:28:42,438
I know that in my heart.

329
00:28:42,538 --> 00:28:44,806
I also know that he was just trying
to protect his brother, you know?

330
00:28:44,906 --> 00:28:47,242
I know. But a bottle,
that can kill you.

331
00:28:47,342 --> 00:28:48,508
It's a case of
it's you or him.

332
00:28:48,608 --> 00:28:50,480
If he'd come at you with his
bare hands, that'd be different.

333
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,577
That wouldn't
have been fair.

334
00:28:51,677 --> 00:28:54,016
Well, technically, your bare hands
can kill somebody, too.

335
00:28:54,116 --> 00:28:56,885
They can be deadly weapons, too.
I mean, what if he knew karate, say?

336
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,185
You said he was
a lollipop man.

337
00:28:58,285 --> 00:29:00,088
He was a lollipop man.

338
00:29:00,188 --> 00:29:02,423
What's a lollipop man doing
knowing fucking karate?

339
00:29:02,523 --> 00:29:03,522
I'm just saying.

340
00:29:03,622 --> 00:29:06,158
- How old was he?
- About 50.

341
00:29:06,258 --> 00:29:08,665
What's a 50-year-old lollipop man
doing knowing fucking karate?

342
00:29:08,765 --> 00:29:11,100
What was he,
a Chinese lollipop man?

343
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,278
Jesus, Ken, I'm trying to
talk about...

344
00:29:22,696 --> 00:29:24,580
I know what you're
trying to talk about.

345
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,949
I killed a little boy.
You keep bringing up fucking lollipop men!

346
00:29:28,049 --> 00:29:29,784
You didn't mean
to kill a little boy.

347
00:29:29,884 --> 00:29:31,838
I know I didn't mean to.

348
00:29:33,874 --> 00:29:37,389
But because of the choices I made and
the course that I put into action,

349
00:29:37,489 --> 00:29:39,727
a little boy
isn't here anymore.

350
00:29:39,827 --> 00:29:42,043
And he'll never be here again.

351
00:29:46,653 --> 00:29:49,645
I mean here in the world,
not here in Belgium.

352
00:29:51,291 --> 00:29:52,906
Well, he'll never be here in Belgium,
either, will he?

353
00:29:53,006 --> 00:29:56,278
I mean, he might have wanted
to come here when he got older.

354
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:57,990
I don't know why.

355
00:29:59,566 --> 00:30:01,761
And that's all because of me.

356
00:30:03,837 --> 00:30:05,952
He's dead because of me.

357
00:30:06,052 --> 00:30:07,472
And I'm trying to...

358
00:30:08,208 --> 00:30:11,405
I'm trying to get me head
around it, but I can't.

359
00:30:12,579 --> 00:30:15,377
I will always have
killed that little boy.

360
00:30:17,317 --> 00:30:19,751
That ain't ever
going away. Ever.

361
00:30:21,188 --> 00:30:22,450
Unless...

362
00:30:23,824 --> 00:30:25,416
Maybe I go away.

363
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,423
Don't even think like that.

364
00:31:28,021 --> 00:31:29,511
You look good.

365
00:31:33,894 --> 00:31:35,862
What's it matter anyway?

366
00:32:01,187 --> 00:32:02,734
So, what do you do, Raymond?

367
00:32:02,834 --> 00:32:05,723
I shoot people for money.

368
00:32:08,595 --> 00:32:10,311
What kinds of people?

369
00:32:10,411 --> 00:32:13,682
Priests. Children.
You know, the usual.

370
00:32:13,782 --> 00:32:15,781
Is there a lot of money to be made
in that line of business?

371
00:32:15,881 --> 00:32:17,883
There is in priests.
There isn't in children.

372
00:32:17,983 --> 00:32:19,220
So what is it you do, Chloe?

373
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,400
I sell cocaine and heroin
to Belgian film crews.

374
00:32:22,876 --> 00:32:24,070
Do you?

375
00:32:26,613 --> 00:32:28,410
Do I look like I do?

376
00:32:29,983 --> 00:32:31,563
You do, actually.

377
00:32:34,587 --> 00:32:37,488
Do I look like
I shoot people?

378
00:32:38,758 --> 00:32:39,782
No.

379
00:32:41,695 --> 00:32:43,185
Just children.

380
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:44,992
Mmm-hmm.

381
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:54,122
I saw your midget today.
Little prick didn't even say hello.

382
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,057
Well, he's on a lot of ketamine.

383
00:32:56,157 --> 00:32:57,575
What's that?

384
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,663
Horse tranquilizer.

385
00:33:00,763 --> 00:33:02,327
A horse tranquilizer?

386
00:33:02,427 --> 00:33:04,867
- Where'd he get that?
- I sold it to him.

387
00:33:04,967 --> 00:33:08,045
You can't sell horse tranquilizers
to a midget!

388
00:33:11,257 --> 00:33:13,575
This movie, I think it's gonna be
a very good one.

389
00:33:13,675 --> 00:33:16,045
There's never been a classic movie
made in Bruges until now.

390
00:33:16,145 --> 00:33:17,744
Of course there hasn't,
it's a shithole.

391
00:33:17,844 --> 00:33:19,079
Bruges is my hometown, Ray.

392
00:33:19,179 --> 00:33:20,346
Well, it's still a shithole.

393
00:33:20,446 --> 00:33:21,446
It's not a shithole.

394
00:33:21,546 --> 00:33:24,048
What? Even midgets have to
take drugs to stick it.

395
00:33:24,148 --> 00:33:25,399
Okay.

396
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:31,057
So, you've insulted my hometown.

397
00:33:31,157 --> 00:33:33,529
You're doing very well, Raymond.

398
00:33:33,629 --> 00:33:36,032
Why don't you tell me some
Belgian jokes while you're at it?

399
00:33:36,132 --> 00:33:37,696
I don't know any Belgian jokes.

400
00:33:37,796 --> 00:33:41,069
And if I did, I think I'd have
the good sense not to...

401
00:33:41,169 --> 00:33:45,637
Hey, hang on. Is Belgium where there
were all those child abuse murders lately?

402
00:33:45,737 --> 00:33:47,955
Then I do know a Belgian joke.

403
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:52,355
What's Belgium famous for?

404
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,216
Chocolates and child abuse.

405
00:33:54,316 --> 00:33:57,895
And they only invented the chocolates
to get to the kids.

406
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,267
What?

407
00:34:00,874 --> 00:34:04,173
One of the girls they murdered was
a friend of mine.

408
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,581
I'm sorry, Chloe.

409
00:34:25,098 --> 00:34:28,146
One of the girls they murdered
wasn't a friend of mine.

410
00:34:28,246 --> 00:34:30,951
I just wanted to
make you feel bad.

411
00:34:31,051 --> 00:34:33,369
And it worked.
Quite well.

412
00:34:52,492 --> 00:34:54,289
Fucking unbelievable.

413
00:35:07,574 --> 00:35:09,323
What's fucking unbelievable?

414
00:35:09,423 --> 00:35:11,274
Are you talking to me?

415
00:35:12,879 --> 00:35:16,063
He pauses, even though he
should just hit the cunt.

416
00:35:16,163 --> 00:35:17,499
And he repeats.

417
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:21,971
Yes, I am talking to you.
What's fucking unbelievable?

418
00:35:22,071 --> 00:35:24,373
Well, I'll tell you what's
fucking unbelievable, shall I?

419
00:35:24,473 --> 00:35:27,107
Blowing cigarette smoke straight into
myself and my girlfriend's face.

420
00:35:27,207 --> 00:35:28,409
That's fucking unbelievable!

421
00:35:28,509 --> 00:35:31,645
- This is the smoking section.
- I don't care if it's the smoking section.

422
00:35:31,745 --> 00:35:34,083
All right?
She directed it right in my face, man.

423
00:35:34,183 --> 00:35:37,086
I don't wanna
die just because of your fucking arrogance.
Uh-huh.

424
00:35:37,186 --> 00:35:40,123
Isn't that what the
Vietnamese used to say?

425
00:35:40,223 --> 00:35:43,391
Vietnamese? What are you
talking about, the Vietnamese?

426
00:35:43,491 --> 00:35:45,192
That statement makes
no fucking sense at all.

427
00:35:45,292 --> 00:35:47,129
- Yes it does.
- The Vietnamese!

428
00:35:47,229 --> 00:35:49,863
Well, saying it over and over ain't
gonna make any more sense out of it.

429
00:35:49,963 --> 00:35:52,802
How does the Vietnamese
have any relevance whatsoever

430
00:35:52,902 --> 00:35:55,400
to myself and my girlfriend
having to breathe

431
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,137
your friend's cigarette smoke?

432
00:35:57,237 --> 00:35:59,283
Tell me how saying...

433
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:02,954
That's for John Lennon,
you Yankee fucking cunt!

434
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:05,728
A bottle? No, don't bother.

435
00:36:20,047 --> 00:36:21,241
We're leaving.

436
00:36:21,415 --> 00:36:24,714
I don't hit women!
I would never hit a woman, Chloe!

437
00:36:25,652 --> 00:36:27,666
I'd hit a woman who was trying to
hit me with a bottle!

438
00:36:27,766 --> 00:36:30,471
That's different.
That's self-defense, isn't it?

439
00:36:30,571 --> 00:36:32,942
Or a woman who could do karate.

440
00:36:33,042 --> 00:36:36,710
I'd never hit a woman generally, Chloe.
Don't think that.

441
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:38,526
God, you're pretty.

442
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,951
I have to make a call.

443
00:36:42,051 --> 00:36:43,059
Oh, no.

444
00:36:43,704 --> 00:36:48,232
You've gone off me, now, haven't you?
Just because I hit that fucking cow.

445
00:37:12,799 --> 00:37:15,632
<i>Hello?
Where the fuck
were you yesterday?</i>

446
00:37:16,136 --> 00:37:19,320
We just popped out for some dinner,
Harry. We only popped out for half an hour.

447
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,885
<i>Yeah? What'd you have?</i>

448
00:37:20,985 --> 00:37:22,757
<i>- For dinner?
- Yeah.</i>

449
00:37:22,857 --> 00:37:23,990
Pizza, at Pizza Hut.

450
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:25,124
<i>Was it nice?</i>

451
00:37:25,224 --> 00:37:27,096
Yeah, it was all right.
I don't know. It was Pizza Hut.

452
00:37:27,196 --> 00:37:28,660
The same as in England.

453
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:32,480
<i>Well, that's globalization,
isn't it? Is Ray there with you?</i>

454
00:37:33,186 --> 00:37:35,104
He's in the toilet.

455
00:37:35,204 --> 00:37:37,370
<i>- Can he hear?
- No.</i>

456
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:39,139
<i>What's he doing?</i>

457
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:42,376
<i>- What do you mean?
- Is he doing a wee or a poo?</i>

458
00:37:42,476 --> 00:37:44,077
I don't know, Harry,
the door's closed.

459
00:37:44,177 --> 00:37:48,396
<i>Send him out on an errand for half
an hour, but don't make it sound suspicious.</i>

460
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,069
Ray? Why don't you go out down
to the pub for half an hour?

461
00:37:59,746 --> 00:38:02,564
Yeah, yeah, I know I said you couldn't,

462
00:38:02,664 --> 00:38:04,378
but might as well enjoy ourselves, eh?

463
00:38:05,418 --> 00:38:09,616
No, I don't know if they've got
bowling anywhere.
Could have a look.

464
00:38:10,757 --> 00:38:12,247
Yeah, see you.

465
00:38:23,403 --> 00:38:24,618
Yeah. He's gone.

466
00:38:24,718 --> 00:38:26,954
<i>What'd you say to him?</i>

467
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:29,459
I said, 'Why don't you go have a drink,
you say you've been cooped up?'

468
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:31,590
<i>- What did he say?
- Said, yeah, he would.</i>

469
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:34,192
And he might go have a look to see
if there's a bowling alley around.

470
00:38:34,292 --> 00:38:35,895
<i>Was he just having a wee?</i>

471
00:38:35,995 --> 00:38:37,799
Yeah, I think so.
I assume so.

472
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:38,931
<i>Sure he didn't mind?</i>

473
00:38:39,031 --> 00:38:40,566
No, he was glad to get out.

474
00:38:40,666 --> 00:38:41,768
<i>He's definitely gone?</i>

475
00:38:41,868 --> 00:38:43,272
Yeah, yeah, he slammed the door.

476
00:38:43,372 --> 00:38:46,621
<i>That don't mean he's gone.
Go check outside the door.</i>

477
00:39:03,476 --> 00:39:05,293
Harry, he's definitely gone.

478
00:39:05,393 --> 00:39:07,560
<i>You realize there are no
bowling alleys in Bruges?</i>

479
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:10,128
I realize that, Harry.
The boy wanted to have a look anyway.

480
00:39:10,228 --> 00:39:12,568
<i>What are they gonna have,
a medieval fucking bowling alley?</i>

481
00:39:12,668 --> 00:39:14,936
As I say, I think he was just glad
to get out and about.

482
00:39:15,036 --> 00:39:18,002
<i>So, is he having a nice time,
seeing all the canals and that?</i>

483
00:39:18,102 --> 00:39:20,240
<i>I had a lovely time
when I was there.</i>

484
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:22,841
<i>All the canals and the
old buildings and that.</i>

485
00:39:22,941 --> 00:39:24,009
When were you here?

486
00:39:24,109 --> 00:39:27,931
<i>When I was seven.
Last happy holiday I fucking had.</i>

487
00:39:28,435 --> 00:39:31,050
<i>- Have you been on a canal trip, yet?
- Yeah.</i>

488
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:33,319
<i>Have you been down, like,
all the old cobbled streets and that?</i>

489
00:39:33,419 --> 00:39:34,453
Yeah.

490
00:39:34,553 --> 00:39:36,723
<i>It's like a fairytale,
isn't it, that place?
Yeah.</i>

491
00:39:36,823 --> 00:39:38,728
<i>With the churches and that.
They're Gothic.
Yeah.</i>

492
00:39:38,828 --> 00:39:40,359
<i>- Is it Gothic?
- Yeah.</i>

493
00:39:40,459 --> 00:39:42,995
<i>So he's having
a really nice time?</i>

494
00:39:43,095 --> 00:39:45,901
Well, I'm having
a really nice time.

495
00:39:46,001 --> 00:39:48,750
I'm not sure if it's
really his cup of tea.

496
00:39:51,491 --> 00:39:52,617
<i>What?</i>

497
00:39:53,126 --> 00:39:55,106
You know, I'm not sure
if it's really his thing.

498
00:39:55,206 --> 00:39:56,810
<i>What do you mean,
'It's not really his thing'?</i>

499
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:59,012
<i>What's that supposed to mean,
'It's not really his thing'?</i>

500
00:39:59,112 --> 00:40:00,415
<i>What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?</i>

501
00:40:00,515 --> 00:40:01,513
Nothing, Harry.

502
00:40:01,613 --> 00:40:03,682
<i>It's a fairytale
fucking town, isn't it?</i>

503
00:40:03,782 --> 00:40:06,520
<i>How can a fairytale town not be
somebody's fucking thing?</i>

504
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:09,722
<i>How can all those canals and bridges
and cobbled streets and those churches,</i>

505
00:40:09,822 --> 00:40:12,059
<i>all that beautiful
fucking fairytale stuff,</i>

506
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:14,030
<i>how can that not be
somebody's fucking thing, eh?</i>

507
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:15,430
What I think I meant to say was:

508
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:17,298
<i>- Is the swan still there?
- Yeah, the swan's...</i>

509
00:40:17,398 --> 00:40:20,500
<i>How can fucking swans not fucking
be somebody's fucking thing, eh?</i>

510
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,701
<i>How can that be?</i>

511
00:40:21,801 --> 00:40:22,902
What I think I meant to say was,

512
00:40:23,002 --> 00:40:26,139
when he first arrived,
he wasn't quite sure about it.

513
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:30,208
You know, there's that big, dual
carriageway when you get off the train?

514
00:40:30,308 --> 00:40:32,547
It mightn't have been here when you
were here last, Harry.

515
00:40:32,647 --> 00:40:35,585
Well, as soon as he got into,
like, the old town proper,

516
00:40:35,685 --> 00:40:39,522
and he saw the canals and the bridges and,
you know, the swans and that,

517
00:40:39,622 --> 00:40:41,524
well, he just
fucking loved it then.

518
00:40:41,624 --> 00:40:45,123
Couldn't get enough of it,
the medieval part of town.

519
00:40:45,223 --> 00:40:49,829
It was just that initial, dual carriageway
thing sort of put him off for a second.

520
00:40:49,929 --> 00:40:51,598
<i>Don't know if I remember
a dual carriageway.</i>

521
00:40:51,698 --> 00:40:53,001
<i>Must be recent.</i>

522
00:40:53,101 --> 00:40:54,436
<i>Hasn't spoilt it, has it?</i>

523
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:57,786
No, no, no, it's just that
initial thing.

524
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,955
And you know what?

525
00:41:03,196 --> 00:41:05,311
As we were walking
through the streets,

526
00:41:05,411 --> 00:41:10,563
there was this sort of freezing fog
hanging over everything,

527
00:41:11,004 --> 00:41:14,789
and it made it look almost like
a fairytale or something.

528
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:16,387
And he turned to me,
do you know what he said?

529
00:41:16,487 --> 00:41:18,023
<i>What'd he say?</i>

530
00:41:18,123 --> 00:41:23,128
He said, 'Ken, I know I'm awake,
but I feel like I'm in a dream.'

531
00:41:23,228 --> 00:41:25,567
<i>Yeah? He said that?</i>

532
00:41:25,667 --> 00:41:26,665
Yeah.

533
00:41:26,765 --> 00:41:29,301
<i>Meaning, like,
in a good dream?</i>

534
00:41:29,401 --> 00:41:32,241
Yeah. Of course,
like in a good dream.

535
00:41:32,341 --> 00:41:35,711
<i>Oh, good. I'm glad
he likes it there.</i>

536
00:41:35,811 --> 00:41:37,747
<i>I'm glad we were able
to give him something.</i>

537
00:41:37,847 --> 00:41:41,665
<i>Something good and happy. Because he
wasn't a bad kid, was he?</i>

538
00:41:43,103 --> 00:41:44,195
Huh?

539
00:41:44,471 --> 00:41:46,837
<i>He wasn't a bad kid,
was he?</i>

540
00:41:47,941 --> 00:41:50,956
<i>Listen, take down this address.
Raamstraat 17.</i>

541
00:41:51,056 --> 00:41:54,104
<i>That's 'Raam,' like 'Ram,'
but with an extra 'a:'</i>

542
00:41:55,081 --> 00:41:56,161
Raamstraat 17.

543
00:41:56,261 --> 00:41:57,841
<i>You got that?</i>

544
00:41:58,218 --> 00:41:59,635
Yes, Raamstraat 17.

545
00:41:59,735 --> 00:42:03,938
<i>Good. There'll be a man there tomorrow
morning at 9::00, his name's Yuri.</i>

546
00:42:04,038 --> 00:42:05,706
<i>- Yuri.
- He'll give you the gun.</i>

547
00:42:05,806 --> 00:42:07,677
<i>Ring me on the public phone
at Jimmy Driscoll's</i>

548
00:42:07,777 --> 00:42:10,594
<i>about 3:00 or 4:00 tomorrow,
after it's done.</i>

549
00:42:11,564 --> 00:42:13,225
After what's done?

550
00:42:13,933 --> 00:42:15,696
<i>Are you being thick?</i>

551
00:42:17,404 --> 00:42:19,086
<i>- No.
- Listen, I like Ray.</i>

552
00:42:19,186 --> 00:42:21,557
<i>He was a good bloke, but when it
all comes down to it, you know,</i>

553
00:42:21,657 --> 00:42:24,723
<i>he blew the head off a little
fucking kid. And you brought him in, Ken.</i>

554
00:42:24,823 --> 00:42:28,269
<i>So if the buck don't stop with him,
where does it stop?</i>

555
00:42:33,787 --> 00:42:34,845
<i>Ken?</i>

556
00:42:36,022 --> 00:42:38,373
<i>If the buck don't stop with him,
where does it stop?</i>

557
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:40,438
It stops with me, Harry.
That's an easy one.

558
00:42:40,538 --> 00:42:42,654
<i>Look, don't get shirty, Ken.</i>

559
00:42:43,563 --> 00:42:48,484
<i>Listen, I'm just glad that I was able
to do something for the boy before he went.</i>

560
00:42:48,584 --> 00:42:50,183
Do what for the boy?

561
00:42:50,283 --> 00:42:52,704
<i>You know, have him
get to see Bruges.</i>

562
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:56,703
<i>I'd like to go to see
Bruges again before I die.</i>

563
00:42:57,477 --> 00:43:01,004
<i>What was it he said again about:
Yeah, 'It's like a dream:'</i>

564
00:43:02,782 --> 00:43:06,047
'I know I'm awake, but I feel like
I'm in a dream.'

565
00:43:08,521 --> 00:43:09,613
<i>Yeah.</i>

566
00:43:11,491 --> 00:43:13,789
<i>Give me a call
when he's dead.</i>

567
00:43:37,884 --> 00:43:41,270
That's my fucking girlfriend,
you asshole.

568
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:42,569
Eirik, what are you doing?

569
00:43:42,669 --> 00:43:44,405
Where are you from, fucker?

570
00:43:44,505 --> 00:43:45,958
Ireland, originally.

571
00:43:46,759 --> 00:43:49,009
And you think it's okay
to come over to Belgium

572
00:43:49,109 --> 00:43:50,844
and fuck another man's girl?

573
00:43:50,944 --> 00:43:52,747
Look, I didn't know she had
a boyfriend, all right?

574
00:43:52,847 --> 00:43:55,785
And I haven't fucked her, anyway.
Ask her. I'd only put me hand on it.

575
00:43:55,885 --> 00:43:57,837
Eirik, put the gun down!

576
00:43:59,038 --> 00:44:01,457
Get down on your knees
and open your mouth.

577
00:44:01,557 --> 00:44:03,088
Don't start being silly.

578
00:44:03,188 --> 00:44:04,939
Get down on your:

579
00:44:05,845 --> 00:44:09,428
Exactly at what point was it that
all skinheads suddenly became poofs?

580
00:44:09,528 --> 00:44:10,663
Used to be,
you were a skinhead,

581
00:44:10,763 --> 00:44:13,000
you just went around beating up
Pakistani 12-year-olds.

582
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:16,385
Now it seems a prerequisite
to be a fucking bum-boy!

583
00:44:17,924 --> 00:44:19,105
That's not gonna help you, man.

584
00:44:19,205 --> 00:44:21,956
Ray, there's only
blanks in that gun.

585
00:44:28,535 --> 00:44:30,318
Eirik, don't!

586
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:31,686
Now who's the fucking bum-boy?

587
00:44:31,786 --> 00:44:34,001
You, you fucking bum-boy!

588
00:44:36,176 --> 00:44:37,992
Chloe, what exactly
is going on here?

589
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:40,226
I can't see!
I can't see!

590
00:44:40,326 --> 00:44:44,700
Of course you can't
fucking see! I just shot
a blank in your fucking eyes!

591
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:49,705
- Is this fella your boyfriend?
- No. I mean, he used to be.

592
00:44:49,805 --> 00:44:50,937
Well, what's he doing here?

593
00:44:51,037 --> 00:44:54,444
We... We rob tourists, sometimes.

594
00:44:54,544 --> 00:44:57,462
I fucking knew it was too good
to be true!

595
00:44:57,830 --> 00:44:59,580
I knew you'd have never
shagged me, normally.

596
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,882
No! That's not true, I...

597
00:45:01,982 --> 00:45:05,320
I called it off tonight.
I told him not to come tonight.

598
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:06,519
Why did you come tonight?

599
00:45:06,619 --> 00:45:08,288
Chloe, I can't see,
I swear it!

600
00:45:08,388 --> 00:45:10,855
Stop whingeing
like a big gay baby.

601
00:45:10,955 --> 00:45:12,491
I haven't had a shag in months!

602
00:45:12,591 --> 00:45:17,562
I can't see out of this eye, Chloe!
I have to go to the hospital!

603
00:45:17,662 --> 00:45:19,366
I'll drive you.

604
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:21,201
Great! Now the whole
night's ruined!

605
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:22,536
No!

606
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:26,570
You can stay if you want. I just
don't know how long I'll be.

607
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:29,511
I just knew someone like you
would never like someone like me.

608
00:45:29,611 --> 00:45:32,346
- I just knew.
- What do you mean, someone like me?

609
00:45:32,446 --> 00:45:34,400
You know, someone nice.

610
00:45:41,274 --> 00:45:43,765
Call me. Please.

611
00:45:49,049 --> 00:45:50,311
Chloe!

612
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:31,279
Cha-ching!

613
00:47:01,087 --> 00:47:02,538
Have you got some
sort of problem?

614
00:47:02,138 --> 00:47:04,074
No, no problem.

615
00:47:04,174 --> 00:47:06,888
Four beers in 20 minutes.
No problem.

616
00:47:08,829 --> 00:47:10,091
Fuck off.

617
00:47:18,205 --> 00:47:20,320
Beer and a red wine.

618
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:21,874
I'll be back.

619
00:47:24,445 --> 00:47:26,228
How's the movie going?

620
00:47:26,328 --> 00:47:30,464
It's a jumped-up Eurotrash piece of
rip-off fucking bullshit.

621
00:47:30,564 --> 00:47:32,485
Like, in a bad way?

622
00:47:35,989 --> 00:47:37,671
Your girlfriend's
very pretty.

623
00:47:37,771 --> 00:47:41,558
She ain't my girlfriend.
She's a prostitute I just picked up.

624
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:46,111
Didn't know there were
any prostitutes in Bruges.

625
00:47:46,211 --> 00:47:48,585
You just have to look
in the right places.

626
00:47:48,685 --> 00:47:50,330
Brothels are good.

627
00:47:51,872 --> 00:47:54,853
Well, you've picked up
a very pretty prostitute.

628
00:47:54,953 --> 00:47:56,307
Thank you.

629
00:48:00,781 --> 00:48:02,544
You from the States?

630
00:48:03,384 --> 00:48:04,510
Yeah.

631
00:48:04,885 --> 00:48:06,336
But don't hold it against me.

632
00:48:06,436 --> 00:48:07,785
I'll try not to.

633
00:48:09,289 --> 00:48:12,349
Just try not to say
anything too loud or crass.

634
00:48:30,077 --> 00:48:32,428
Hey-ho. Drowning
your sorrows, huh?

635
00:48:32,528 --> 00:48:36,230
What sorrows?
You know, being a sad, old, ugly little man.

636
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:37,497
One gay beer, please.

637
00:48:37,597 --> 00:48:38,698
How'd your date go?

638
00:48:38,798 --> 00:48:41,002
My date involved two instances of
extreme violence.

639
00:48:41,102 --> 00:48:43,102
One instance of her hand on my cock
and my finger up her thing,

640
00:48:43,202 --> 00:48:46,076
which lasted all too briefly.
Isn't that always the way?

641
00:48:46,176 --> 00:48:49,546
One instance of me stealing five grams of
her very-high-quality cocaine,

642
00:48:49,646 --> 00:48:51,778
and one instance of me
blinding a poofy little skinhead.

643
00:48:51,878 --> 00:48:55,049
So, all in all, my evening
pretty much balanced out fine.

644
00:48:55,149 --> 00:48:57,228
You got five grams of coke?

645
00:48:58,005 --> 00:48:59,687
I've got four grams on me
and one gram in me,

646
00:48:59,787 --> 00:49:01,056
which is why me heart
is going like the clappers,

647
00:49:01,156 --> 00:49:02,356
as if I'm about to
have a heart attack.

648
00:49:02,456 --> 00:49:04,625
So if I collapse any minute now,
please remember to tell the doctors

649
00:49:04,725 --> 00:49:06,326
that it might have something
to do with the coke.

650
00:49:06,426 --> 00:49:07,831
Give us a gram, then.

651
00:49:07,931 --> 00:49:09,867
I thought you were laying off,
because it makes you depressed?

652
00:49:09,967 --> 00:49:13,351
You know what? Right now,
I don't really give a fuck.

653
00:49:41,548 --> 00:49:44,664
Why didn't you wave hello to me
today when I waved hello to you today?

654
00:49:44,764 --> 00:49:47,299
I was on a very strong
horse tranquilizer today.

655
00:49:47,399 --> 00:49:52,290
I wasn't waving hello to anybody,
except maybe to a horse.

656
00:49:52,759 --> 00:49:55,178
Huh? What are you
talking about?

657
00:49:55,278 --> 00:49:57,321
Just horseshit.

658
00:49:58,332 --> 00:50:00,047
You from America?

659
00:50:00,147 --> 00:50:02,681
Yeah. But don't
hold it against me.

660
00:50:02,781 --> 00:50:05,688
Well, that's for me
to decide, isn't it?

661
00:50:05,788 --> 00:50:07,190
Are you from America, too?

662
00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:08,787
No, I'm from Amsterdam.

663
00:50:08,887 --> 00:50:10,260
Amsterdam.

664
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:13,162
Amsterdam is just a load of bloody
prostitutes, isn't it?

665
00:50:13,262 --> 00:50:15,227
Yes. That's why I came to Bruges.

666
00:50:15,327 --> 00:50:18,580
I thought I'd get
a better price for my pussy here.

667
00:50:20,354 --> 00:50:21,343
Huh?

668
00:50:22,956 --> 00:50:24,617
You two are weird.

669
00:50:26,727 --> 00:50:28,854
Would you like some cocaine?

670
00:50:31,398 --> 00:50:34,196
I've also got some
acid and some ecstasy.

671
00:50:45,045 --> 00:50:47,525
Hervé Villechaize, I know, did.

672
00:50:47,625 --> 00:50:50,378
<i>The dwarf off, I think,
The Time Bandits, did.</i>

673
00:50:51,618 --> 00:50:53,279
Lots of midgets:

674
00:50:53,854 --> 00:50:56,379
Dwarves, top themselves.

675
00:50:56,823 --> 00:50:58,586
Hmm. Shitloads.

676
00:51:01,428 --> 00:51:02,793
Would you ever think about it?

677
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:04,219
Huh?

678
00:51:04,565 --> 00:51:07,917
Would you ever think about killing
yourself because you're a midget?

679
00:51:08,017 --> 00:51:11,050
Fuck, man!
What kind of question is that?

680
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:12,696
We're just chatting,
aren't we?

681
00:51:19,413 --> 00:51:22,495
See, Ken, this is the kind of hotel
Harry should have put us in.

682
00:51:22,595 --> 00:51:25,017
A five-star,
with prostitutes in.

683
00:51:25,686 --> 00:51:30,282
You know, sometimes, I think Harry
doesn't even give a shit about us at all.

684
00:51:31,758 --> 00:51:33,726
Has he still not called?

685
00:51:35,529 --> 00:51:37,143
No. Still hasn't called.

686
00:51:37,243 --> 00:51:38,822
No news is good news, eh?

687
00:51:48,208 --> 00:51:49,197
Hmm.

688
00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:51,741
Who's she?

689
00:51:53,614 --> 00:51:55,741
There's gonna be a war, man.

690
00:51:56,617 --> 00:51:57,933
I can see it.

691
00:51:58,033 --> 00:52:02,000
There's gonna be a war between the
blacks and between the whites.

692
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:04,541
You ain't even gonna need
a uniform no more.

693
00:52:04,641 --> 00:52:07,274
This ain't gonna be a war
where you pick your side.

694
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:08,778
Your side's already
picked for you.

695
00:52:08,878 --> 00:52:11,877
And I know whose side I'm fighting on.
I'm fighting with the blacks.

696
00:52:11,977 --> 00:52:13,613
The whites are gonna get
their heads kicked in!

697
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:15,917
You don't decide
this shit, man.

698
00:52:16,017 --> 00:52:17,887
Well, who are the half-castes
gonna fight with?

699
00:52:17,987 --> 00:52:20,620
The blacks, man.
That's obvious.

700
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,141
But what about the Pakistanis?

701
00:52:24,211 --> 00:52:26,839
The blacks.
What about...

702
00:52:27,848 --> 00:52:29,372
Think of a hard one.

703
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:32,398
What about the Vietnamese?

704
00:52:32,498 --> 00:52:33,937
The blacks!

705
00:52:34,037 --> 00:52:38,583
Well, I'm definitely fighting with
the blacks if they've got the Vietnamese.

706
00:52:42,696 --> 00:52:44,095
So, hang on.

707
00:52:44,998 --> 00:52:46,747
Would all of the white midgets in
the world be fighting

708
00:52:46,847 --> 00:52:48,251
against all the black
midgets in the world?

709
00:52:48,351 --> 00:52:50,098
Yeah.

710
00:52:50,804 --> 00:52:52,931
That would make a good film!

711
00:52:53,807 --> 00:52:58,540
You don't know how much shit I've had
to take off of black midgets, man.

712
00:52:59,079 --> 00:53:00,376
That's...

713
00:53:01,982 --> 00:53:03,698
Undeniably true.

714
00:53:03,798 --> 00:53:05,251
See, Jimmy,

715
00:53:06,753 --> 00:53:08,414
my wife was black.

716
00:53:10,023 --> 00:53:12,048
And I loved her very much.

717
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:18,154
And in 1976, she was murdered
by a white man.

718
00:53:19,866 --> 00:53:24,030
So, where the fuck am I supposed
to stand in all this blood and carnage?

719
00:53:25,639 --> 00:53:27,971
Did they get the guy who did it?

720
00:53:28,408 --> 00:53:29,488
A friend of mine got him.

721
00:53:29,588 --> 00:53:31,601
Harry Waters got him.

722
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:38,015
So tell me, Jim, whose side do I fight
on in this wonderful war?

723
00:53:41,088 --> 00:53:44,148
I think you need to
weigh up all your options

724
00:53:45,258 --> 00:53:47,783
and let your conscience decide, Ken.

725
00:53:57,037 --> 00:54:01,133
Two manky hookers
and a racist dwarf.

726
00:54:01,675 --> 00:54:02,822
I think I'm heading home.

727
00:54:02,922 --> 00:54:05,343
Yeah. I think I'll come with you.

728
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:10,161
What's...
Back off, shorty!

729
00:54:10,261 --> 00:54:12,135
You don't know karate.

730
00:54:12,235 --> 00:54:13,197
Don't say you didn't
have it coming.

731
00:54:13,297 --> 00:54:15,083
Don't say you didn't
have it coming.

732
00:54:15,388 --> 00:54:16,719
Shortarse!

733
00:55:43,243 --> 00:55:44,424
Meeting Yuri.

734
00:55:44,524 --> 00:55:45,603
Yes, I'm Yuri.

735
00:56:15,242 --> 00:56:17,972
Mr. Waters said
that might be necessary.

736
00:56:21,215 --> 00:56:24,673
There are a lot of alcoves
in the Koningin Astrid Park.

737
00:56:25,586 --> 00:56:27,781
You use this word,
'alcoves'?

738
00:56:28,589 --> 00:56:30,805
'Alcoves'? Yes. Sometimes.

739
00:56:30,905 --> 00:56:35,055
There are not many people around
in these alcoves in Christmastime.

740
00:56:35,596 --> 00:56:38,929
If I were to murder a man,
I would murder him here.

741
00:56:41,702 --> 00:56:44,621
Are you sure this is
the right word, 'alcoves'?

742
00:56:44,721 --> 00:56:48,355
'Alcoves,' yes.
It's kind of like 'nooks and crannies.'

743
00:56:48,455 --> 00:56:52,526
'Nooks and crannies,' yes.
Perhaps this would be more accurate.

744
00:56:52,626 --> 00:56:56,014
'Nooks and crannies,'
rather than 'alcoves.' Yeah.

745
00:57:02,356 --> 00:57:06,777
You are going to do it, aren't you?
Mr. Waters will be very disappointed...

746
00:57:06,877 --> 00:57:09,454
Of course I'm going to fucking do it.

747
00:57:10,998 --> 00:57:12,556
It's what I do.

748
00:57:18,839 --> 00:57:22,104
Your friend was behaving
rather oddly this morning.

749
00:57:29,583 --> 00:57:31,096
Oddly? How?

750
00:57:31,196 --> 00:57:35,315
Well, he asked me about the baby,
and if I wanted a boy or a girl.

751
00:57:36,156 --> 00:57:39,542
I said I didn't mind as long as
it's healthy, of course.

752
00:57:39,642 --> 00:57:43,960
But then he gave me 200 euros
to give to the baby.

753
00:57:45,466 --> 00:57:50,369
I refused, obviously,
but he was quite insistent.

754
00:57:52,206 --> 00:57:55,266
Would you give it back to him
when you see him?

755
00:57:56,009 --> 00:58:00,025
I don't want to appear ungrateful, but it
seemed like all the money he had.

756
00:58:00,125 --> 00:58:04,106
- Do you know where he is now?
- He said he was going to the park.

757
00:59:03,710 --> 00:59:05,075
Sorry, Ray.

758
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:08,345
I'm sorry.

759
00:59:39,046 --> 00:59:40,227
Ray, don't!

760
00:59:40,327 --> 00:59:42,896
Fucking hell!
Where the fuck did you come from?

761
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:45,964
- I was behind the thing.
- What the fuck are you doing, Ray?

762
00:59:46,064 --> 00:59:47,532
What the fuck are you doing?

763
00:59:47,632 --> 00:59:48,667
Nothing.

764
00:59:50,891 --> 00:59:52,290
Oh, my God!

765
00:59:54,328 --> 00:59:56,888
- You were gonna kill me.
- No, I wasn't.

766
00:59:57,397 --> 00:59:59,558
You were gonna kill yourself!

767
01:00:02,302 --> 01:00:03,619
I'm allowed to.

768
01:00:03,719 --> 01:00:04,717
No, you're not!

769
01:00:04,817 --> 01:00:05,931
What?

770
01:00:06,506 --> 01:00:09,441
I'm not allowed to and you are?
How's that fair?

771
01:00:16,583 --> 01:00:19,780
Can we go somewhere
and talk about this, please?

772
01:00:22,990 --> 01:00:25,172
I wasn't gonna go
through with it, Ray.

773
01:00:25,272 --> 01:00:29,319
You fucking looked like you were
gonna go fucking through with it.

774
01:00:31,365 --> 01:00:33,047
Where'd you get that gun?

775
01:00:33,147 --> 01:00:34,713
A friend of Harry's.

776
01:00:34,813 --> 01:00:36,132
Fuck, man.

777
01:00:38,772 --> 01:00:40,262
Let me see it.

778
01:00:44,277 --> 01:00:45,767
Silencer, too.

779
01:00:48,315 --> 01:00:49,407
Nice.

780
01:00:54,988 --> 01:00:57,286
Mine's a bloody girl's gun.

781
01:01:06,433 --> 01:01:08,924
I'm keeping it.
Pardon me?

782
01:01:11,204 --> 01:01:13,454
Give me me gun back.
You're not getting it back.

783
01:01:13,554 --> 01:01:14,654
You're a suicide case.

784
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:17,458
And you were trying to shoot me
in the fucking head.

785
01:01:17,558 --> 01:01:19,091
You're not getting
that gun back.

786
01:01:19,191 --> 01:01:21,997
A great day this has
turned out to be.

787
01:01:22,097 --> 01:01:25,051
I'm suicidal,
me mate tries to kill me,

788
01:01:25,152 --> 01:01:28,747
me gun gets nicked
and we're still in fucking Bruges.

789
01:01:30,057 --> 01:01:34,343
Listen, I'm gonna give you some money
and put you on a train somewhere.

790
01:01:34,443 --> 01:01:35,778
Back to England?

791
01:01:35,878 --> 01:01:38,877
You can't go back to England, Ray.
You'd be a dead man!

792
01:01:38,977 --> 01:01:41,013
I want to be a dead man.

793
01:01:41,113 --> 01:01:42,762
Have you been missing something?

794
01:01:44,471 --> 01:01:46,769
You don't want to be
a dead man, Ray.

795
01:01:49,609 --> 01:01:51,474
I killed a little boy!

796
01:02:05,559 --> 01:02:07,789
Then save the next little boy.

797
01:02:09,262 --> 01:02:11,287
Just go away somewhere,

798
01:02:12,032 --> 01:02:15,468
get out of this business
and try to do something good.

799
01:02:16,570 --> 01:02:19,061
You're not gonna
help anybody dead.

800
01:02:19,639 --> 01:02:22,233
You're not gonna
bring that boy back.

801
01:02:24,344 --> 01:02:26,676
But you might save the next one.

802
01:02:28,181 --> 01:02:30,411
What am I gonna be, a doctor?

803
01:02:31,118 --> 01:02:32,676
You need exams.

804
01:02:33,487 --> 01:02:36,115
Do anything, Ray.
Do anything.

805
01:02:52,172 --> 01:02:53,662
What a wanker!

806
01:02:55,676 --> 01:02:57,667
He said this whole trip,

807
01:02:59,747 --> 01:03:02,147
this whole being in Bruges thing,

808
01:03:02,916 --> 01:03:06,716
was just to give you one last,
joyful memory before you died.

809
01:03:08,188 --> 01:03:09,553
In Bruges?

810
01:03:15,262 --> 01:03:16,991
The Bahamas, maybe.

811
01:03:18,966 --> 01:03:20,695
Why fucking Bruges?

812
01:03:21,368 --> 01:03:23,302
I suppose it's cheaper.

813
01:03:30,010 --> 01:03:32,604
The rest of the acid
and the ecstasy.

814
01:03:33,681 --> 01:03:35,979
Can I have me gun back, please?

815
01:03:40,988 --> 01:03:42,956
What am I gonna do, Ken?

816
01:03:44,058 --> 01:03:46,720
- What am I gonna do?
- Just keep moving.

817
01:03:47,828 --> 01:03:49,746
Keep on moving.

818
01:03:49,846 --> 01:03:51,889
Try not to think about it.

819
01:03:53,167 --> 01:03:54,584
Learn a new language, maybe?

820
01:03:54,684 --> 01:03:56,648
Sure, I can hardly do English.

821
01:03:56,748 --> 01:03:57,952
That's one thing
I like about Europe, though.

822
01:03:58,052 --> 01:04:00,119
You don't have to learn
any of their languages.

823
01:04:00,219 --> 01:04:02,890
Just forget about home for a while.

824
01:04:02,990 --> 01:04:06,424
See how the land lies
in six years, seven years.

825
01:04:06,524 --> 01:04:08,708
Seven years is not that long.

826
01:04:09,383 --> 01:04:11,464
It's longer than that boy got.

827
01:04:11,564 --> 01:04:14,043
Me first fucking job.

828
01:04:15,389 --> 01:04:17,721
Great hitman I turned out to be.

829
01:04:21,562 --> 01:04:24,497
Some people just aren't
cut out for it, Ray.

830
01:04:25,132 --> 01:04:26,360
Are you?

831
01:04:32,639 --> 01:04:35,164
When are you
going back to England?

832
01:04:35,943 --> 01:04:37,990
I'll head back in a couple
of hours or something.

833
01:04:38,090 --> 01:04:41,707
Harry's not gonna be mad at you,
is he? For letting me go?

834
01:04:42,349 --> 01:04:43,362
I'll sort out Harry.

835
01:04:43,462 --> 01:04:46,634
Just tell him I'll have probably
killed meself in a fortnight, anyway.

836
01:04:46,734 --> 01:04:48,711
You won't, will you, Ray?

837
01:05:08,175 --> 01:05:10,560
Harry? It's Ken.

838
01:05:10,660 --> 01:05:12,236
Listen to this noise.

839
01:05:14,615 --> 01:05:16,831
Do you know what that is?

840
01:05:16,931 --> 01:05:20,804
Yeah, I know you know it's a train.
Do you know what train?

841
01:05:20,904 --> 01:05:24,274
Well, it's a train that Ray just
got on, and he's alive and he's well,

842
01:05:24,374 --> 01:05:26,743
and he doesn't know where he's going
and neither do I.

843
01:05:26,843 --> 01:05:29,645
So if you need to do your worst,
do your worst.

844
01:05:29,745 --> 01:05:32,947
You've got the address of the hotel.
I'll be here waiting.

845
01:05:33,047 --> 01:05:36,082
Because I've got to quite
like Bruges, now.

846
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:38,161
It's like a fucking
fairytale or something.

847
01:06:07,835 --> 01:06:09,029
Harry.

848
01:06:09,837 --> 01:06:10,997
Harry!

849
01:06:11,538 --> 01:06:12,618
What?

850
01:06:12,718 --> 01:06:14,754
It's an inanimate fucking object.

851
01:06:14,854 --> 01:06:17,333
You're an inanimate fucking object!

852
01:06:27,521 --> 01:06:30,271
Now, you lot be good for your mummy
and Imamoto, okay?

853
01:06:30,371 --> 01:06:32,337
'Cause Daddy's got to
go away for a few days.

854
01:06:32,437 --> 01:06:33,405
Where are you going?

855
01:06:33,505 --> 01:06:35,074
I've got to go to Bruges.

856
01:06:35,174 --> 01:06:36,742
Bruges? Where's that?

857
01:06:36,842 --> 01:06:37,888
It's in Belgium.

858
01:06:39,266 --> 01:06:41,651
Why would anybody
have to go to Belgium?

859
01:06:41,751 --> 01:06:44,418
'Cause I've got to
sort something out.

860
01:06:44,518 --> 01:06:46,923
Is it something
to do with the phone?

861
01:06:47,023 --> 01:06:48,770
It's something to do with Ken.

862
01:06:50,511 --> 01:06:52,308
It's a matter of honor.

863
01:06:53,514 --> 01:06:56,244
Well, it ain't gonna
be dangerous, is it?

864
01:06:59,186 --> 01:07:02,471
Well, of course it's gonna be dangerous
if it's a matter of fucking honor!

865
01:07:02,571 --> 01:07:04,035
You are bringing the fellas with you?

866
01:07:04,135 --> 01:07:06,991
Tell me you're bringing
the fellas with you.

867
01:07:07,494 --> 01:07:08,756
Harry.

868
01:07:09,396 --> 01:07:12,214
I'm sorry for calling you
an inanimate object.

869
01:07:12,314 --> 01:07:13,698
I was upset.

870
01:08:53,567 --> 01:08:56,035
You're Irish?
Yes.

871
01:08:57,504 --> 01:08:59,165
What is your name?

872
01:09:01,375 --> 01:09:03,434
Derek Perlurrl.

873
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:09,043
You hit the Canadian.

874
01:09:09,716 --> 01:09:11,567
You hit the Canadian.

875
01:09:11,667 --> 01:09:15,611
I 'heet' the Canadian?
I don't know what you're talking about.

876
01:09:18,325 --> 01:09:20,850
That's him!
That's the motherfucker.

877
01:09:27,134 --> 01:09:29,227
You hit the Canadian, yeah?

878
01:09:30,237 --> 01:09:32,398
Canadian? Shit.

879
01:09:38,945 --> 01:09:41,880
- We're taking you back to Bruges.
- Brilliant.

880
01:10:09,509 --> 01:10:10,737
Aye aye.

881
01:10:11,812 --> 01:10:13,905
Take your pick, Mr. Waters.

882
01:10:17,217 --> 01:10:19,135
An Uzi?

883
01:10:19,235 --> 01:10:22,071
I'm not from South Central
Los fucking Angeles.

884
01:10:22,171 --> 01:10:25,873
I didn't come here to shoot 20 black
10-year-olds in a fucking drive-by.

885
01:10:25,973 --> 01:10:28,689
I want a normal gun
for a normal person.

886
01:10:40,273 --> 01:10:42,624
I knew he wouldn't kill the guy.

887
01:10:42,724 --> 01:10:46,873
I could see it in his eyes when I was
telling him about the alcoves.

888
01:10:48,081 --> 01:10:49,662
- About the what?
- The alcoves.

889
01:10:49,762 --> 01:10:52,514
The alcoves in the
Koningin Astrid Park.

890
01:10:55,155 --> 01:10:57,371
Oh, I also have some dumdums.

891
01:10:57,471 --> 01:11:00,905
You use this word,'dumdums'?
The bullets that make the head explode?

892
01:11:01,005 --> 01:11:02,344
Dumdums, yeah.

893
01:11:02,444 --> 01:11:05,023
Would you like some
of these dumdums?

894
01:11:05,532 --> 01:11:07,295
I know I shouldn't,

895
01:11:08,935 --> 01:11:10,300
but I will.

896
01:11:15,308 --> 01:11:16,775
Motherfucker.

897
01:11:18,078 --> 01:11:19,091
Is he talking to me?

898
01:11:19,191 --> 01:11:21,327
No, Eirik's on your side,
Mr. Waters.

899
01:11:21,427 --> 01:11:23,428
Your young friend
blinded him last night.

900
01:11:23,528 --> 01:11:24,563
Ray did?

901
01:11:24,663 --> 01:11:27,950
I was trying to rob him
and he took my gun from me.

902
01:11:29,222 --> 01:11:31,573
And the gun
was full of blanks,

903
01:11:31,673 --> 01:11:33,285
and he shot the blank
into my eye.

904
01:11:34,394 --> 01:11:38,956
And now, I cannot see from this eye
ever again, the doctors say.

905
01:11:39,666 --> 01:11:42,984
Well, to be honest, it sounds like
it was all your fault.

906
01:11:43,084 --> 01:11:44,082
What?

907
01:11:44,182 --> 01:11:46,955
I mean, basically, if you're robbing
a man and you're only carrying blanks,

908
01:11:47,055 --> 01:11:48,958
and you allow your gun
to be taken off you,

909
01:11:49,058 --> 01:11:51,258
and you allow yourself to be shot
in the eye with a blank,

910
01:11:51,358 --> 01:11:54,893
for which I assume the person has to get
quite close to you, then,

911
01:11:54,993 --> 01:11:58,232
yeah, really, it's all your fault
for being such a poof.

912
01:11:58,332 --> 01:12:01,237
So why don't you stop whingeing
and cheer the fuck up?

913
01:12:01,337 --> 01:12:03,881
Eirik, I really wouldn't respond.

914
01:12:11,031 --> 01:12:12,212
I thought you wanted the guy dead?

915
01:12:12,312 --> 01:12:14,414
I do want the guy dead.
I want him fucking crucified.

916
01:12:14,514 --> 01:12:17,786
But it don't change the fact
that he stitched you up like
a blind, little gay boy.

917
01:12:17,886 --> 01:12:18,895
Does it?

918
01:12:20,841 --> 01:12:22,832
Thanks for the gun, Yuri.

919
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:30,435
Well?

920
01:13:32,579 --> 01:13:34,497
The boy is suicidal, Harry.

921
01:13:34,597 --> 01:13:36,572
He's a walking dead man.

922
01:13:37,418 --> 01:13:39,398
Keeps going on
about Hell and purgatory:

923
01:13:39,498 --> 01:13:41,871
When I phoned you
yesterday, did I ask you,

924
01:13:41,971 --> 01:13:45,504
'Ken, will you do me a favor and
become Ray's psychiatrist, please?'

925
01:13:45,604 --> 01:13:50,075
No. What I think I asked you was,
'Could you go blow his fucking head off for me?'

926
01:13:50,175 --> 01:13:52,144
'He's suicidal'?

927
01:13:52,244 --> 01:13:55,714
I'm suicidal. You're suicidal.
Everybody's fucking suicidal!

928
01:13:55,814 --> 01:13:57,985
We don't all keep
going on about it!

929
01:13:58,085 --> 01:14:02,425
Has he killed himself yet?
No. So he's not fucking suicidal, is he?

930
01:14:02,525 --> 01:14:04,894
He put a loaded gun to his head this morning.
I stopped him.

931
01:14:04,994 --> 01:14:07,503
He...What?
This gets fucking worse!

932
01:14:08,415 --> 01:14:09,495
We were down in the park...

933
01:14:09,595 --> 01:14:13,531
Let me get this right.
You were down in the park?

934
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:15,735
What's that got to do
with fucking anything?

935
01:14:15,835 --> 01:14:18,675
Let me get this right. Not only
have you refused to kill the boy,

936
01:14:18,775 --> 01:14:20,941
you've even stopped the boy
from killing himself,

937
01:14:21,041 --> 01:14:22,276
which would have
solved my problem,

938
01:14:22,376 --> 01:14:23,611
which would have
solved your problem,

939
01:14:23,711 --> 01:14:25,582
which sounds like
it would've solved
the boy's problem.

940
01:14:25,682 --> 01:14:27,280
It wouldn't have
solved his problem.

941
01:14:27,380 --> 01:14:31,316
Ken, if I had killed a little kid,
accidentally or otherwise,

942
01:14:31,416 --> 01:14:32,620
I wouldn't have thought twice.

943
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:35,220
I'd have killed myself on the
fucking spot. On the fucking spot.

944
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:37,958
I'd have stuck the gun in me mouth
on the fucking spot!

945
01:14:38,058 --> 01:14:41,661
That's you, Harry.
The boy has the capacity to change.

946
01:14:41,761 --> 01:14:44,200
The boy has the capacity to do
something decent with his life.

947
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:47,720
Excuse me, Ken.
I have the capacity to change.

948
01:14:48,489 --> 01:14:52,050
Yeah, you do. You've the capacity
to get fucking worse!

949
01:14:52,659 --> 01:14:55,140
Yeah, now I'm
getting down to it!

950
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:57,113
Harry, let's face it.

951
01:14:57,213 --> 01:14:59,880
And I'm not being funny,
I mean no disrespect,

952
01:14:59,980 --> 01:15:01,384
but you're a cunt.

953
01:15:01,484 --> 01:15:04,286
You're a cunt now,
you've always been a cunt.

954
01:15:04,386 --> 01:15:08,089
And the only thing that's
gonna change is you're gonna
become an even bigger cunt.

955
01:15:08,189 --> 01:15:09,654
Maybe have some
more cunt kids.

956
01:15:09,754 --> 01:15:11,824
Leave my kids fucking out of it.
What have they done?

957
01:15:11,924 --> 01:15:14,330
You fucking retract that bit
about my cunt fucking kids!

958
01:15:14,430 --> 01:15:16,664
I retract that bit about
your cunt fucking kids.

959
01:15:16,764 --> 01:15:20,434
Insulting my fucking kids!
That's going overboard, mate!

960
01:15:20,534 --> 01:15:22,512
I retracted it, didn't I?

961
01:15:25,726 --> 01:15:26,739
Still leaves you being a cunt.

962
01:15:26,839 --> 01:15:29,387
Yeah, I fucking got that.

963
01:15:47,948 --> 01:15:49,575
Where's Ray now?

964
01:15:50,884 --> 01:15:53,533
Oh, right about now,
Ray is in one or other

965
01:15:53,633 --> 01:15:59,183
of the one million towns in
mainland Europe it's possible
to be in, other than here.

966
01:16:13,106 --> 01:16:15,525
I'll get all the money
back to you soon as I
get through to me friend.

967
01:16:15,625 --> 01:16:17,189
It's not a problem,
Raymond.

968
01:16:17,289 --> 01:16:19,926
And I'll get all your acid and
your ecstasy back to you, too.

969
01:16:20,026 --> 01:16:21,526
English humor!

970
01:16:21,626 --> 01:16:24,345
I'm assuming you've
got your gun on you.

971
01:16:27,054 --> 01:16:29,506
That Yuri bloke's
a funny fella, isn't he?

972
01:16:29,606 --> 01:16:30,750
He does yoga.

973
01:16:32,125 --> 01:16:33,340
'The alcoves.'

974
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:35,759
Was he going on
to you about the alcoves?

975
01:16:37,097 --> 01:16:39,964
'The alcoves
in the Koningin Astrid Park.'

976
01:16:48,375 --> 01:16:51,856
Harry, I know you gotta do
what you gotta do.

977
01:16:51,956 --> 01:16:53,795
It's a bit crowded
round here, you know?

978
01:16:53,895 --> 01:16:55,163
Well, I'm not gonna
have a shootout

979
01:16:55,263 --> 01:16:57,739
in the middle of a thousand
fucking Belgians, am I?

980
01:16:59,886 --> 01:17:03,368
Not to mention the other
nationalities, just on their holidays.

981
01:17:03,468 --> 01:17:04,446
Hmm.

982
01:17:05,225 --> 01:17:08,043
To see the swans and the Gothic
and all the fairytale stuff, eh?

983
01:17:08,143 --> 01:17:11,480
- Are you trying to fucking wind me up?
- No, Harry.

984
01:17:11,580 --> 01:17:13,950
On top of calling me a cunt
and calling me kids cunts.

985
01:17:14,050 --> 01:17:16,987
I might just have to
fucking shoot you right here.

986
01:17:17,087 --> 01:17:18,298
Christ!

987
01:17:21,642 --> 01:17:23,701
Let's go up the bell tower.

988
01:17:24,778 --> 01:17:26,960
Be quiet up there
this time of evening.

989
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:28,708
Let's go up there.

990
01:17:47,501 --> 01:17:50,129
Yeah. Canadians.

991
01:17:50,971 --> 01:17:54,121
I feel a bit bad. They didn't kill
John Lennon, did they?

992
01:17:54,221 --> 01:17:56,659
Anyway, supposed to turn up
to court here in two days.

993
01:17:56,759 --> 01:17:57,756
Are you going to turn up?

994
01:17:57,856 --> 01:17:58,857
Don't know.

995
01:17:58,957 --> 01:18:01,175
What have I got to
stay for really?

996
01:18:03,617 --> 01:18:06,245
The most beautiful woman

997
01:18:07,954 --> 01:18:09,581
you've ever seen

998
01:18:10,924 --> 01:18:13,017
in all of your stupid life.

999
01:18:23,603 --> 01:18:25,488
The tower is closed this evening.

1000
01:18:25,588 --> 01:18:27,754
No way. It's supposed
to be open till 7:00.

1001
01:18:27,854 --> 01:18:29,922
The tower is usually
open until 7:00.

1002
01:18:30,022 --> 01:18:32,727
Yesterday an American
had a heart attack up the tower.

1003
01:18:32,827 --> 01:18:34,197
Today the tower is closed.

1004
01:18:34,297 --> 01:18:38,274
Here, cranky, here's 100 for you.
We're only gonna be 20 minutes.

1005
01:18:43,490 --> 01:18:49,576
The tower is closed this evening.

1006
01:18:49,676 --> 01:18:51,995
Understand, Englishman?

1007
01:19:31,304 --> 01:19:33,284
Jimmy, I've been wanting to say

1008
01:19:33,384 --> 01:19:36,624
I'm really sorry for
karate-chopping you the other night.

1009
01:19:36,724 --> 01:19:39,061
That was way out of order.

1010
01:19:39,161 --> 01:19:43,763
You know, Ray, I'd find it easier
to believe and forgive you, somehow,

1011
01:19:43,863 --> 01:19:48,935
if the two of you weren't
laughing straight in my fucking face!

1012
01:19:51,658 --> 01:19:53,990
It's for the goddamn movie, man.

1013
01:19:57,631 --> 01:19:59,656
It is a nice town, Harry.

1014
01:20:01,301 --> 01:20:03,292
I'm glad I got to see it.

1015
01:20:07,507 --> 01:20:11,624
I didn't mean to be taking the
piss out of it being a fairytale place.

1016
01:20:11,724 --> 01:20:13,542
It is a fairytale place.

1017
01:20:14,281 --> 01:20:15,976
- It really is.
- Hmm.

1018
01:20:16,216 --> 01:20:17,864
It's just a shame
it's in Belgium, really.

1019
01:20:17,964 --> 01:20:21,303
But then you figure if it wasn't
in Belgium, if it was somewhere good,

1020
01:20:21,403 --> 01:20:25,518
there'd be too many people coming to
see it. It would spoil the whole thing.

1021
01:20:27,561 --> 01:20:29,791
Well, I'm glad I got to see it

1022
01:20:31,632 --> 01:20:33,122
before I died.

1023
01:20:40,274 --> 01:20:42,003
What are you doing?

1024
01:20:42,509 --> 01:20:44,427
What are you fucking doing?

1025
01:20:44,527 --> 01:20:46,342
I'm not fighting anymore, Harry.

1026
01:20:47,281 --> 01:20:50,478
All right, then I'm blowing
your fucking head off.

1027
01:20:52,353 --> 01:20:55,811
Don't come over all Gandhi.
What are you fucking doing?

1028
01:20:57,825 --> 01:20:59,473
Ken, stop messing about, please.

1029
01:20:59,573 --> 01:21:01,607
Pick up your gun. I know I'm going
to beat you anyway

1030
01:21:01,707 --> 01:21:04,323
'cause you're a spaz, but...
Harry,

1031
01:21:05,866 --> 01:21:07,891
I'm totally in your debt.

1032
01:21:10,838 --> 01:21:13,966
The things that have
gone between us in the past,

1033
01:21:14,675 --> 01:21:16,458
I love you unreservedly
for all that.

1034
01:21:16,558 --> 01:21:17,703
What?

1035
01:21:18,679 --> 01:21:20,408
For your integrity.

1036
01:21:21,382 --> 01:21:22,940
For your honor.

1037
01:21:23,851 --> 01:21:25,250
I love you.

1038
01:21:27,688 --> 01:21:30,054
The boy had to be let go.

1039
01:21:32,459 --> 01:21:34,859
The boy had to be given a chance.

1040
01:21:35,362 --> 01:21:40,812
And if to do that, I had to say,
'Fuck you, and fuck what I owe you,

1041
01:21:40,912 --> 01:21:45,634
'and fuck everything that's gone on
between us,' then that's what I had to do.

1042
01:21:46,106 --> 01:21:48,097
But I'm not fighting you.

1043
01:21:49,643 --> 01:21:51,724
And I accept, totally,
everything you've got to do.

1044
01:21:51,824 --> 01:21:53,643
I accept it. Totally.

1045
01:21:57,484 --> 01:21:58,746
Oh, yeah?

1046
01:22:01,054 --> 01:22:02,146
Yeah.

1047
01:22:07,194 --> 01:22:11,790
Well, you say all that fucking stuff,
I can't fucking shoot you now, can I?

1048
01:22:13,167 --> 01:22:15,647
It's entirely up to you, Harry.

1049
01:22:15,747 --> 01:22:17,727
It's entirely your call.

1050
01:22:19,306 --> 01:22:22,139
All I'm saying is
I'm not fighting.

1051
01:22:29,550 --> 01:22:31,130
Oh, you fucking cunt!

1052
01:22:31,230 --> 01:22:32,433
Look, I'm not gonna
do nothing to you

1053
01:22:32,533 --> 01:22:36,319
just 'cause you're standing about
like Robert fucking Powell.

1054
01:22:37,157 --> 01:22:38,839
- Like who?
- Like Robert fucking Powell

1055
01:22:38,939 --> 01:22:40,743
<i>out of Jesus of
fucking Nazareth!</i>

1056
01:22:40,843 --> 01:22:41,988
My fucking leg!

1057
01:22:42,563 --> 01:22:46,511
The psycho dwarf turns out to just be
a loveable little schoolboy,

1058
01:22:46,611 --> 01:22:49,114
and it's all some kind of
Boschian nightmare.

1059
01:22:49,214 --> 01:22:50,682
Kiss my ass!

1060
01:22:50,782 --> 01:22:54,935
I guess at least there weren't any
black people involved, eh, Jimmy?

1061
01:22:56,210 --> 01:22:57,575
I wasn't...

1062
01:22:58,412 --> 01:23:00,437
I wasn't talking about...

1063
01:23:01,615 --> 01:23:04,630
There's gonna be a war between
all the blacks and all the whites.

1064
01:23:04,730 --> 01:23:06,501
And all the black midgets
and all the white midgets,

1065
01:23:06,601 --> 01:23:08,735
which would actually
be really good.

1066
01:23:08,835 --> 01:23:10,571
That's just cocaine.

1067
01:23:10,671 --> 01:23:13,076
He didn't even want
the Vietnamese on his side!

1068
01:23:13,176 --> 01:23:15,287
That's just cocaine.

1069
01:23:16,263 --> 01:23:19,947
Listen, we're filming down
by the pointy building tonight.

1070
01:23:20,047 --> 01:23:22,524
It might actually be good for once.

1071
01:23:23,871 --> 01:23:25,952
You guys should come along.

1072
01:23:26,052 --> 01:23:30,772
We...I think we're just gonna have
a quiet one tonight, Jimmy.

1073
01:23:32,779 --> 01:23:34,440
That's how it is!

1074
01:23:36,450 --> 01:23:38,042
In another life.

1075
01:23:44,858 --> 01:23:46,951
They're great,
aren't they?

1076
01:24:02,075 --> 01:24:04,600
You didn't. You didn't!

1077
01:24:53,327 --> 01:24:55,818
Mr. Waters? Mr. Waters?

1078
01:24:58,298 --> 01:25:00,789
- Who's that?
- It's Eirik.

1079
01:25:02,269 --> 01:25:04,203
- The blind boy?
- Yeah.

1080
01:25:05,706 --> 01:25:06,866
Yes.

1081
01:25:07,774 --> 01:25:10,024
What do you fucking want?

1082
01:25:10,124 --> 01:25:11,623
The guy you're looking for,

1083
01:25:11,723 --> 01:25:14,806
the guy Ray, he's downstairs
at the bar.

1084
01:25:51,118 --> 01:25:52,676
I'm sorry, Ken.

1085
01:25:53,854 --> 01:25:57,415
But you can't kill a kid
and expect to get away with it.

1086
01:25:59,393 --> 01:26:00,917
You just can't.

1087
01:26:16,276 --> 01:26:18,892
- Where?
- To the left when you come out.

1088
01:26:18,992 --> 01:26:20,776
The bar to the left.

1089
01:29:37,478 --> 01:29:38,726
Ken!

1090
01:29:41,448 --> 01:29:43,382
Ken! Ken!

1091
01:29:45,386 --> 01:29:46,876
Harry's here.

1092
01:29:49,089 --> 01:29:50,181
What?

1093
01:29:51,658 --> 01:29:52,852
Take

1094
01:29:54,528 --> 01:29:55,790
my gun.

1095
01:30:09,176 --> 01:30:10,302
Ken?

1096
01:30:11,412 --> 01:30:12,936
Where's my gun?

1097
01:30:14,915 --> 01:30:16,507
Where's my gun?

1098
01:30:19,486 --> 01:30:22,649
I'm gonna die now, I think.

1099
01:30:24,625 --> 01:30:26,024
Oh, Ken!

1100
01:30:27,995 --> 01:30:29,155
Jesus!

1101
01:32:36,924 --> 01:32:38,341
Mr. Blakely said you had left.

1102
01:32:38,441 --> 01:32:39,674
I need the key
to the room right now.

1103
01:32:39,774 --> 01:32:41,284
Quickly, now!

1104
01:32:42,162 --> 01:32:44,344
And you gotta go home right now.
It's very, very dangerous here.

1105
01:32:44,444 --> 01:32:45,921
- All right? Go home! Right now!
- Okay.

1106
01:33:30,711 --> 01:33:34,862
No, I won't let you
up there! Put that gun away, right now!

1107
01:33:34,962 --> 01:33:36,630
Lady, get out of
my fucking way, please.

1108
01:33:36,730 --> 01:33:39,811
No, I won't. I won't
get out of your way.

1109
01:33:40,687 --> 01:33:42,166
You'll have to go through me.

1110
01:33:42,266 --> 01:33:45,073
Well, obviously,
I'm not gonna through you,
am I, with a baby and that?

1111
01:33:45,173 --> 01:33:46,171
I'm a nice person.

1112
01:33:46,271 --> 01:33:48,989
But could you just get out
of the fucking way, please?

1113
01:33:54,334 --> 01:33:55,494
Marie!

1114
01:33:56,470 --> 01:33:58,787
Just let him come up, it's okay.

1115
01:33:58,887 --> 01:34:02,157
Harry, swear not to start
shooting until she's left the hotel.

1116
01:34:02,257 --> 01:34:05,628
I swear not to start shooting till she's
left the hotel. I totally swear.

1117
01:34:05,728 --> 01:34:08,164
Well, I'm not going anywhere.

1118
01:34:08,264 --> 01:34:10,397
This is my hotel.

1119
01:34:10,497 --> 01:34:12,247
So you can fuck off!

1120
01:34:24,898 --> 01:34:27,765
- I suppose you've got a gun up there?
- Yeah.

1121
01:34:28,969 --> 01:34:31,686
Then what are we gonna do?
We can't stand here all night.

1122
01:34:31,786 --> 01:34:34,820
Why don't you both put your
guns down and go home?

1123
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:37,968
Don't be stupid.
This is the shootout.

1124
01:34:39,646 --> 01:34:42,728
- Harry, I've got an idea.
- What?

1125
01:34:42,828 --> 01:34:45,032
My room faces onto the canal, right?

1126
01:34:45,132 --> 01:34:47,801
I'm gonna go back to me room,
jump into the canal,

1127
01:34:47,901 --> 01:34:49,969
see if I can swim to the other side
and escape.

1128
01:34:50,069 --> 01:34:52,273
Right. If you go outside
and round the corner,

1129
01:34:52,373 --> 01:34:54,710
you can shoot at me from there
and try and get me.

1130
01:34:54,810 --> 01:34:57,247
That way, we leave this lady and her
baby out of the whole, entire thing.

1131
01:34:57,347 --> 01:34:59,648
Do you completely promise
to jump into the canal?

1132
01:34:59,748 --> 01:35:01,516
I don't want to run out there,
come back in 10 minutes

1133
01:35:01,616 --> 01:35:03,148
and find you fucking
hiding in a cupboard.

1134
01:35:03,248 --> 01:35:04,519
I completely promise, Harry.

1135
01:35:04,619 --> 01:35:06,922
I'm not gonna risk having another
little kid die, am I?

1136
01:35:07,022 --> 01:35:11,158
So, hang on, I go outside,
then I go which way, right or left?

1137
01:35:11,258 --> 01:35:12,695
You go right, don't you?

1138
01:35:12,795 --> 01:35:15,760
You can see it from the doorway!
It's a big fucking canal!

1139
01:35:15,860 --> 01:35:18,802
All right. Jesus!
I've only just got here, haven't I?

1140
01:35:18,902 --> 01:35:21,703
Okay. On a count of
'one, two, three, go,' okay?

1141
01:35:21,803 --> 01:35:22,948
Okay.

1142
01:35:28,862 --> 01:35:30,145
What? Who says it?

1143
01:35:30,245 --> 01:35:31,614
Oh, you say it.

1144
01:35:31,714 --> 01:35:33,616
You guys are crazy.

1145
01:35:33,716 --> 01:35:35,084
- Are you ready?
- Ready.

1146
01:35:35,184 --> 01:35:36,681
- Set?
- Set.

1147
01:35:36,781 --> 01:35:38,567
One, two, three, go!

1148
01:35:52,652 --> 01:35:54,119
Keep driving!

1149
01:36:01,161 --> 01:36:03,527
No way. You're way
too far away.

1150
01:38:06,253 --> 01:38:08,036
The little boy.

1151
01:38:08,136 --> 01:38:09,179
That's right, Ray.

1152
01:38:10,323 --> 01:38:11,881
The little boy.

1153
01:39:17,691 --> 01:39:18,680
Oh.

1154
01:39:20,927 --> 01:39:22,121
I see.

1155
01:39:28,768 --> 01:39:30,395
No, Harry.

1156
01:39:31,404 --> 01:39:32,928
He's not...

1157
01:39:35,575 --> 01:39:38,203
You've got to stick
to your principles.

1158
01:40:04,104 --> 01:40:05,853
<i>There's a Christmas tree
somewhere in London</i>

1159
01:40:05,953 --> 01:40:09,841
<i>with a bunch of presents underneath
it that'll never be opened.</i>

1160
01:40:10,477 --> 01:40:14,459
<i>And I thought, 'If I survive all this,
I'll go to that house,</i>

1161
01:40:14,559 --> 01:40:16,297
<i>'apologize to
the mother there,</i>

1162
01:40:16,397 --> 01:40:19,803
<i>'and accept whatever
punishment she chose for me...'</i>

1163
01:40:19,903 --> 01:40:23,254
<i>Prison, death,
it didn't matter.</i>

1164
01:40:24,591 --> 01:40:27,876
<i>Because at least in prison
and at least in death,
you know,</i>

1165
01:40:27,976 --> 01:40:30,327
<i>I wouldn't be
in fucking Bruges.</i>

1166
01:40:32,799 --> 01:40:36,860
<i>But then, like a flash,
it came to me, and I realized,</i>

1167
01:40:39,172 --> 01:40:41,800
<i>'Fuck, man, maybe
that's what Hell is.</i>

1168
01:40:43,410 --> 01:40:46,709
<i>'The entire rest of eternity
spent in fucking Bruges!'</i>

1169
01:40:51,585 --> 01:40:54,418
<i>And I really, really
hoped I wouldn't die.</i>

1170
01:40:57,024 --> 01:40:59,618
<i>I really, really
hoped I wouldn't die.</i>

1171
01:41:00,610 --> 01:41:07,610
