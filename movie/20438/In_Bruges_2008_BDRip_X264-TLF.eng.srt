00:12:57,132 --> 00:12:59,757
What are you
filming midgets for?

160
00:12:59,832 --> 00:13:03,196
It's a Dutch movie.
It's a dream sequence.

161
00:13:04,232 --> 00:13:06,630
It's a pastiche of
Nicholas Roeg's
Don't Look Now.

162
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,666
Not a pastiche, but a...

163
00:13:09,733 --> 00:13:13,256
A"homage" is too strong.
A"nod of the head"?

164
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,962
Wow, your English
is very good.

165
00:13:22,599 --> 00:13:25,327
A lot of midgets
tend to kill themselves.

166
00:13:27,832 --> 00:13:30,094
A disproportionate amount.

167
00:13:30,665 --> 00:13:33,654
Herve Villechaize,
off of Fantasy Island.

168
00:13:34,966 --> 00:13:37,761
I think somebody
off The Time Bandits.

169
00:13:37,832 --> 00:13:41,094
I suppose they must
get really sad about, like,

170
00:13:42,433 --> 00:13:44,194
being really
little and that.

171
00:13:44,266 --> 00:13:46,858
People looking at them
and laughing at them.

172
00:13:46,933 --> 00:13:50,194
Calling them names.
You know, "shortarse."

173
00:13:51,967 --> 00:13:55,922
There's another famous
midget I'm missing,
but I can't remember.

174
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,895
It's not the R2-D2 man.
No, he's still going.

175
00:14:01,267 --> 00:14:05,892
I hope your midget
doesn't kill himself. Your
dream sequence will be fucked.

176
00:14:06,599 --> 00:14:09,088
He doesn't like
being called a midget.
He prefers "dwarf."

177
00:14:09,167 --> 00:14:11,565
Well, this is
exactly my point!

178
00:14:11,634 --> 00:14:14,759
People go around calling
you a midget when you
want to be called a dwarf.

179
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:17,664
Of course you're
gonna blow your head off!

180
00:14:19,434 --> 00:14:22,127
My name's Ray. What's yours?
Chloe.

181
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,293
How did you get past
the security man?

182
00:14:26,367 --> 00:14:29,696
Getting past security men,
it's sort of my job.

183
00:14:29,766 --> 00:14:30,732
You're a shoplifter?

184
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,857
(CHUCKLES) No,
not a shoplifter.

185
00:14:32,933 --> 00:14:34,899
It's a good joke, though.

186
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,025
No.

187
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,595
I'll tell you what I am
at dinner tomorrow night.

188
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:42,064
(CHUCKLING)

189
00:14:56,801 --> 00:14:57,960
Fuck.

190
00:15:10,968 --> 00:15:12,763
How fucking cool.

191
00:15:23,834 --> 00:15:25,630
Mr. Blakely?

192
00:15:25,702 --> 00:15:29,394
Yes. No, Mr. Cranham.
No. Yes. Mr. Blakely. Yes.

193
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,163
You have a message.

194
00:15:39,434 --> 00:15:40,525
Shit!

195
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,594
HARRY. ; Number one,
why aren't you in when
I fucking told you to be in?

196
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:47,792
Number two, why doesn't
this hotel have phones
with fucking voicemail

197
00:15:47,867 --> 00:15:50,628
and not I have to leave
messages with the
fucking receptionist?

198
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:53,599
Number three, you better
fucking be in tomorrow night
when I fucking call again

199
00:15:53,667 --> 00:15:57,793
or there'll be fucking
Hell to pay, I'm fucking
telling you. Harry.

200
00:16:21,935 --> 00:16:23,594
(DOOR LOCK TURNING)

201
00:16:35,034 --> 00:16:37,500
Would you turn
the fucking light off!

202
00:16:37,568 --> 00:16:39,090
Sorry, Ken.

203
00:16:39,168 --> 00:16:41,293
Keep the fucking
noise down!

204
00:16:44,468 --> 00:16:46,229
Someone's in a mood.

205
00:17:00,668 --> 00:17:01,759
(SOFTLY) You'll
never guess what.

206
00:17:01,835 --> 00:17:03,926
Will you shut your
fucking mouth, please,
and go to sleep?

207
00:17:04,002 --> 00:17:05,661
Oh, sorry.

208
00:17:10,135 --> 00:17:13,158
Except I've gotta take me
contact lenses out.

209
00:17:20,269 --> 00:17:21,735
Altogether,

210
00:17:21,803 --> 00:17:23,268
I had

211
00:17:24,602 --> 00:17:27,499
five pints of beer
and six bottles.

212
00:17:29,035 --> 00:17:33,297
No. Six pints of beer
and seven bottles.

213
00:17:33,369 --> 00:17:35,994
And you know what?
I'm not even pissed!

214
00:17:41,902 --> 00:17:44,095
You'll never guess what, Ken.

215
00:17:45,768 --> 00:17:47,893
Ken, you'll never guess what.
What?

216
00:17:47,969 --> 00:17:49,094
Got a date for
tomorrow night.

217
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:50,260
I'm very happy for you.

218
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:51,461
With a girl.

219
00:17:51,536 --> 00:17:52,797
Can you turn
the light off, please?

220
00:17:52,903 --> 00:17:55,767
Only been in Bruges one day,
got a date with a girl
in the film business,

221
00:17:55,836 --> 00:17:57,893
the Belgian film business.

222
00:17:59,169 --> 00:18:01,692
They're doing a film
about a midget.

223
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,161
Miss?

224
00:18:22,003 --> 00:18:23,162
Marie?

225
00:18:26,437 --> 00:18:30,835
Sorry about the message
last night. The man who
left it is a bit of a...

226
00:18:32,302 --> 00:18:34,291
Well, he's a bit of a...

227
00:18:34,903 --> 00:18:35,994
Cock?

228
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:39,193
Yes. He's a bit of a cock.

229
00:18:42,469 --> 00:18:43,696
Morning.

230
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,959
Harry called last night.

231
00:18:55,603 --> 00:18:57,125
We missed him.

232
00:18:59,936 --> 00:19:02,402
Jeez, he swears a lot,
doesn't he?

233
00:19:03,603 --> 00:19:06,660
We're staying in tonight.
Whatever happens.

234
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,463
Hmm.

235
00:19:09,804 --> 00:19:11,134
Except...

236
00:19:13,704 --> 00:19:15,000
Hmm.
Hmm.

237
00:19:15,171 --> 00:19:16,761
Except "hmm" what?

238
00:19:16,837 --> 00:19:21,599
Except only one of us
needs to stay in, really.

239
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:22,897
Uh-huh.

240
00:19:24,471 --> 00:19:27,129
And which one of us
would that be, now, Ray?

241
00:19:27,203 --> 00:19:28,635
I thought you
didn't like Bruges.

242
00:19:28,703 --> 00:19:30,499
I don't like Bruges,
it's a shithole.

243
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:34,366
But I did already say
I had a date with
a Belgian lady

244
00:19:34,437 --> 00:19:38,494
in the Belgian film business,
which I did already
say about before.

245
00:19:42,971 --> 00:19:45,698
Just don't get into
any fucking trouble.

246
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:47,895
We're keeping a low profile.

247
00:19:48,503 --> 00:19:52,231
And this morning,
and this afternoon,

248
00:19:52,304 --> 00:19:54,667
we are doing
what I want to do.

249
00:19:54,737 --> 00:19:56,498
Got it?
Of course.

250
00:19:57,371 --> 00:19:59,269
Which, I presume,
will involve culture.

251
00:19:59,338 --> 00:20:03,065
Oh, we shall strike a balance
between culture and fun.

252
00:20:03,137 --> 00:20:07,695
Somehow I believe, Ken,
that the balance shall tip
in the favor of culture.

253
00:20:08,705 --> 00:20:12,569
Like a big, fat,
fucking retarded,
fucking black girl

254
00:20:12,638 --> 00:20:15,331
on a seesaw, opposite

255
00:20:19,072 --> 00:20:20,332
a dwarf.

256
00:20:50,271 --> 00:20:51,828
(DRAGGING FEET)

257
00:20:56,371 --> 00:20:58,963
(SOFTLY) Ray, did we
or did we not agree

258
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:00,526
that if I let you
go on your date tonight,

259
00:21:00,604 --> 00:21:02,570
we'd do the things
I wanted to do today?

260
00:21:02,638 --> 00:21:04,501
We are doing the things
that you wanted to do today.

261
00:21:04,571 --> 00:21:07,129
And that we'd do them
without you throwing
a fucking moody,

262
00:21:07,205 --> 00:21:09,568
like some 5-year-old
who's dropped
all his sweets?

263
00:21:09,638 --> 00:21:11,604
I didn't agree to that.

264
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:14,564
I'll cheer up.
I'll cheer up.

265
00:21:14,972 --> 00:21:17,938
Up there,
the top altar,
is a phial

266
00:21:18,706 --> 00:21:22,194
brought back by
a Flemish knight from the
Crusades in the Holy Land.

267
00:21:22,272 --> 00:21:24,864
And that phial,
do you know what
it's said to contain?

268
00:21:24,939 --> 00:21:26,495
No, what's it
said to contain?

269
00:21:26,572 --> 00:21:30,526
It's said to contain
some drops of
Jesus Christ's blood.

270
00:21:30,604 --> 00:21:34,331
Yeah, that's how
this church got its name.
Basilica of the Holy Blood.

271
00:21:34,404 --> 00:21:35,768
Yeah. Yeah.

272
00:21:35,838 --> 00:21:38,702
And this blood, right,
though it's dried blood,

273
00:21:38,805 --> 00:21:42,862
at different times
over many years, they say
it turned back into liquid.

274
00:21:42,938 --> 00:21:45,597
Turned back into liquid
from dried blood.

275
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:47,796
At various times of great

276
00:21:49,405 --> 00:21:50,632
stress.

277
00:21:50,705 --> 00:21:52,001
Yeah?
Yeah.

278
00:21:52,072 --> 00:21:57,164
So, yeah, I'm gonna go up
in the queue and touch it,
which is what you do.

279
00:21:57,238 --> 00:21:59,397
Yeah?
Yeah. You coming?

280
00:22:00,439 --> 00:22:01,928
Do I have to?

281
00:22:03,472 --> 00:22:06,404
Do you have to?
Of course you
don't have to.

282
00:22:06,472 --> 00:22:10,336
It's Jesus' fucking blood,
isn't it? Of course you
don't fucking have to!

283
00:22:10,405 --> 00:22:12,928
Of course you don't
fucking have to!

284
00:22:56,806 --> 00:22:58,795

murder someone, Raymond?

not out of nothing.

I'm sorry?

I said you, Father.

RAY: I quite like this one.

301
00:26:13,575 --> 00:26:17,837
All the rest were
rubbish by spastics,
but this one's quite good.

302
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,932
What's that
all about, then?

303
00:26:20,809 --> 00:26:24,935
It's Judgment Day,
you know?
Oh, yeah.

304
00:26:27,975 --> 00:26:30,464
What's that then?

305
00:26:30,542 --> 00:26:33,633
Well, it's, you know,
the final day on Earth.

306
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:39,398
When mankind will be
judged for all the crimes
they've committed and that.

307
00:26:40,975 --> 00:26:44,408
And see who gets
into Heaven and who gets
into Hell and all that?

308
00:26:44,475 --> 00:26:45,532
Yeah.

309
00:26:45,608 --> 00:26:47,403
And what's the other place?

310
00:26:47,475 --> 00:26:48,702
Purgatory.

but you weren't
all that great, either.

314
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:00,432
Like Tottenham.

315
00:27:01,376 --> 00:27:03,841
Do you believe
in all that stuff, Ken?

316
00:27:03,909 --> 00:27:05,398
About Tottenham?

317
00:27:05,476 --> 00:27:07,839
The Last Judgment
and the afterlife.

318
00:27:10,809 --> 00:27:13,799
Guilt and sins and

319
00:27:15,309 --> 00:27:18,070
Hell and all that?

320
00:27:20,743 --> 00:27:21,731
Um...

321
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,131
Well...

322
00:27:32,742 --> 00:27:35,799
KEN: I don't know, Ray.
I don't know what I believe.

323
00:27:36,176 --> 00:27:39,630
The things you're
taught as a child, they never
really leave you, do they?

324
00:27:39,709 --> 00:27:41,971
So, like,
I believe in trying
to lead a good life.

325
00:27:42,042 --> 00:27:45,702
Like, if there's an old lady,
carrying her shopping home,

326
00:27:45,775 --> 00:27:49,503
I don't try and help her
carry her shopping,
I don't go that far,

327
00:27:49,576 --> 00:27:53,770
but I'll certainly hold the
door open for her and that,
and let her go out before me.

328
00:27:53,843 --> 00:27:55,968
Yeah. And anyway,
if you tried to help her
carry her shopping,

329
00:27:56,042 --> 00:27:57,975
she'd probably think
you were just trying
to nick her shopping.

330
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:00,873
Exactly.
This is the world
we live in today.

331
00:28:00,943 --> 00:28:04,272
At the same time
as trying to lead
a good life,

332
00:28:05,643 --> 00:28:09,973
I have to reconcile myself
with the fact that, yes,
I have killed people.

333
00:28:10,943 --> 00:28:14,467
Not many people.
Most of them were
not very nice people.

334
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:17,169
Apart from one person.

335
00:28:17,243 --> 00:28:18,641
Who's that?

336
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:21,142
This fellow,
Danny Aliband's brother.

337
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:24,665
He was just trying
to protect his brother.
Like you or I would.

338
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:27,038
He was just a lollipop man.

339
00:28:27,109 --> 00:28:30,564
He came at me with a bottle.
What are you gonna do?

340
00:28:30,643 --> 00:28:32,040
I shot him down.

341
00:28:32,109 --> 00:28:33,097
Hmm.

342
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:37,606
In my book, though,
sorry, someone comes
at you with a bottle,

343
00:28:37,676 --> 00:28:40,234
that is a deadly weapon,
he's gotta take
the consequences.

344
00:28:40,309 --> 00:28:41,707
I know that in my heart.

345
00:28:41,776 --> 00:28:44,072
I also know that he was
just trying to protect
his brother, you know?

346
00:28:44,143 --> 00:28:46,506
I know. But a bottle,
that can kill you.

347
00:28:46,576 --> 00:28:47,769
It's a case of
it's you or him.

348
00:28:47,843 --> 00:28:49,741
If he'd come at you
with his bare hands,
that'd be different.

349
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:50,833
That wouldn't
have been fair.

350
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:53,274
Well, technically,
your bare hands
can kill somebody, too.

351
00:28:53,344 --> 00:28:56,139
They can be
deadly weapons, too. I mean,
what if he knew karate, say?

352
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:57,437
You said he was
a lollipop man.

353
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:59,339
He was a lollipop man.

354
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:01,672
What's a lollipop man doing
knowing fucking karate?

355
00:29:01,744 --> 00:29:02,767
I'm just saying.

356
00:29:02,844 --> 00:29:05,401
How old was he?
About 50.

357
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:07,909
What's a 50-year-old
lollipop man doing
knowing fucking karate?

358
00:29:07,978 --> 00:29:10,341
What was he,
a Chinese lollipop man?

359
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:13,501
Jesus, Ken,
I'm trying to
talk about...

360
00:29:21,911 --> 00:29:23,809
I know what you're
trying to talk about.

361
00:29:23,877 --> 00:29:27,172
I killed a little boy.
You keep bringing up
fucking lollipop men!

362
00:29:27,243 --> 00:29:29,004
You didn't mean
to kill a little boy.

363
00:29:29,077 --> 00:29:31,043
I know I didn't mean to.

364
00:29:33,077 --> 00:29:36,601
But because of the choices
I made and the course
that I put into action,

365
00:29:36,677 --> 00:29:38,938
a little boy
isn't here anymore.

366
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:41,238
And he'll never
be here again.

367
00:29:45,844 --> 00:29:48,833
I mean here in the world,
not here in Belgium.

368
00:29:50,477 --> 00:29:52,103
Well, he'll never be
here in Belgium,
either, will he?

369
00:29:52,178 --> 00:29:55,473
I mean, he might have
wanted to come here
when he got older.

370
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:57,170
I don't know why.

And that's all because of me.

373
00:30:03,011 --> 00:30:05,136
He's dead because of me.

374
00:30:05,211 --> 00:30:06,643
And I'm trying to...

375
00:30:07,378 --> 00:30:10,572
I'm trying to
get me head around it,
but I can't.

376
00:30:11,745 --> 00:30:14,540
I will always have
killed that little boy.

377
00:30:16,478 --> 00:30:18,910
That ain't ever
going away. Ever.

Unless...

379
00:30:22,979 --> 00:30:24,569
Maybe I go away.

380
00:30:29,477 --> 00:30:31,568
Don't even think like that.

(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

So, what do you do, Raymond?

386
00:32:01,879 --> 00:32:04,777
I shoot people for money.

Priests. Children.
You know, the usual.

390
00:32:12,813 --> 00:32:14,836
Is there a lot of money
to be made in that
line of business?

391
00:32:14,913 --> 00:32:16,936
There is in priests.
There isn't in children.

392

So what is it
you do, Chloe?

393
00:32:18,347 --> 00:32:21,438
I sell cocaine and heroin
to Belgian film crews.

395
00:32:25,647 --> 00:32:27,441
Do I look like I do?

Mmm-hmm.

402
00:32:49,779 --> 00:32:53,143
I saw your midget today.
Little prick didn't
even say hello.

403
00:32:53,213 --> 00:32:55,076
Well, he's on
a lot of ketamine.

What's that?

405
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,677
Horse tranquilizer.

406
00:32:59,746 --> 00:33:01,337
A horse tranquilizer?

407
00:33:01,413 --> 00:33:03,878
Where'd he get that?
I sold it to him.

408
00:33:03,946 --> 00:33:07,037
You can't sell
horse tranquilizers
to a midget!

This movie,
I think it's gonna be
a very good one.

There's never been
a classic movie made

Of course there hasn't,
it's a shithole.

Bruges is my hometown, Ray.

Well, it's still a shithole.

414
00:33:19,413 --> 00:33:20,436
It's not a shithole.

415
00:33:20,513 --> 00:33:23,036
What? Even midgets have to
take drugs to stick it.

00:33:23,114 --> 00:33:24,374
Okay.

417
00:33:25,914 --> 00:33:30,039
So, you've insulted
my hometown.

You're doing
very well, Raymond.

Why don't you tell me
some Belgian jokes
while you're at it?

I don't know
any Belgian jokes.

I think I'd have
the good sense not to...

Hey, hang on. Is Belgium
where there were all those
child abuse murders lately?

Chocolates and child abuse.

426
00:33:53,246 --> 00:33:56,838
And they only invented
the chocolates to
get to the kids.

just hit the cunt.

right in my face, man.

of your fucking arrogance.
Uh-huh.

Vietnamese used to say?

talking about, the Vietnamese?

448
00:35:42,815 --> 00:35:44,542
That statement makes
no fucking sense at all.

Yes it does.
The Vietnamese!

450

Well, saying it over
and over ain't gonna make
any more sense out of it.

have any relevance whatsoever

isn't it?

who could do karate.

00:36:41,315 --> 00:36:42,338
Oh, no.

467
00:36:42,982 --> 00:36:47,506
You've gone off me, now,
haven't you? Just because
I hit that fucking cow.

468
00:36:48,282 --> 00:36:49,441
(MUSIC PLAYING ON TV)

469
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:03,040
(PHONE RINGING)

470
00:37:12,049 --> 00:37:14,879
Hello?
HARRY. ; Where the fuck
were you yesterday?

471
00:37:15,383 --> 00:37:18,577
We just popped out for
some dinner, Harry. We only
popped out for half an hour.

472
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:20,138
Yeah? What'd you have?

473
00:37:20,216 --> 00:37:22,012
For dinner?
Yeah.

474
00:37:22,083 --> 00:37:23,242
Pizza, at Pizza Hut.

475
00:37:23,316 --> 00:37:24,373
Was it nice?

476
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,348
Yeah, it was all right.
I don't know.
It was Pizza Hut.

477
00:37:26,416 --> 00:37:27,904
The same as in England.

478
00:37:27,983 --> 00:37:31,710
Well, that's globalization,
isn't it? Is Ray
there with you?

479
00:37:32,415 --> 00:37:34,348
He's in the toilet.

480
00:37:34,415 --> 00:37:36,608
Can he hear?
No.

481
00:37:36,682 --> 00:37:38,376
What's he doing?

482
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:41,609
What do you mean?
Is he doing a wee or a poo?

483
00:37:41,682 --> 00:37:43,308
I don't know, Harry,
the door's closed.

484
00:37:43,383 --> 00:37:47,611
Send him out on an errand
for half an hour, but don't
make it sound suspicious.

485
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:50,042
(SIGHS)

486
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:56,275
Ray? Why don't you
go out down to the pub
for half an hour?

487
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:01,780
Yeah, yeah, I know
I said you couldn't,

488
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:03,577
but might as well
enjoy ourselves, eh?

489
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:08,810
No, I don't know if
they've got bowling anywhere.
Could have a look.

490
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:11,438
Yeah, see you.

491
00:38:22,584 --> 00:38:23,810
Yeah. He's gone.

492
00:38:23,883 --> 00:38:26,145
What'd you say to him?

493
00:38:26,217 --> 00:38:28,648
I said, " Why don't you go
have a drink, you say
you've been cooped up?"

494
00:38:28,717 --> 00:38:30,774
What did he say?
Said, yeah, he would.

495
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,372
And he might go have
a look to see if there's
a bowling alley around.

496
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:35,076
Was he just having a wee?

497
00:38:35,149 --> 00:38:36,979
Yeah, I think so.
I assume so.

498
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:38,107
Sure he didn't mind?

499
00:38:38,184 --> 00:38:39,740
No, he was glad
to get out.

500
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:40,942
He's definitely gone?

501
00:38:41,017 --> 00:38:42,448
Yeah, yeah,
he slammed the door.

502
00:38:42,516 --> 00:38:45,778
That don't mean he's gone.
Go check outside the door.

503
00:39:02,617 --> 00:39:04,446
Harry, he's definitely gone.

504
00:39:04,517 --> 00:39:06,710
You realize there are no
bowling alleys in Bruges?

505
00:39:06,784 --> 00:39:09,272
I realize that, Harry.
The boy wanted to
have a look anyway.

506
00:39:09,351 --> 00:39:11,715
What are they gonna have,
a medieval fucking
bowling alley?

507
00:39:11,784 --> 00:39:14,080
As I say, I think
he was just glad
to get out and about.

508
00:39:14,151 --> 00:39:17,140
So, is he having
a nice time, seeing
all the canals and that?

509
00:39:17,218 --> 00:39:19,376
I had a lovely time
when I was there.

510
00:39:19,451 --> 00:39:21,974
All the canals and the
old buildings and that.

511
00:39:22,051 --> 00:39:23,142
When were you here?

512
00:39:23,218 --> 00:39:27,047
When I was seven.
Last happy holiday
I fucking had.

513
00:39:27,551 --> 00:39:30,176
Have you been on
a canal trip, yet?
Yeah.

514
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:32,443
Have you been down,
like, all the old
cobbled streets and that?

515
00:39:32,517 --> 00:39:33,574
Yeah.

516
00:39:33,651 --> 00:39:35,843
It's like a fairytale,
isn't it, that place?
Yeah.

517
00:39:35,917 --> 00:39:37,850
With the churches and that.
They're Gothic.
Yeah.

518
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:39,474
Is it Gothic?
Yeah.

519
00:39:39,551 --> 00:39:42,108
So he's having
a really nice time?

520
00:39:42,184 --> 00:39:45,015
Well, I'm having
a really nice time.

521
00:39:45,085 --> 00:39:47,846
I'm not sure if it's
really his cup of tea.

522
00:39:50,584 --> 00:39:51,709
What?

523
00:39:52,218 --> 00:39:54,207
You know, I'm not sure
if it's really his thing.

524
00:39:54,285 --> 00:39:55,910
What do you mean,
"It's not really his thing"?

525
00:39:55,985 --> 00:39:58,110
What's that supposed to mean,
"It's not really his thing"?

526
00:39:58,185 --> 00:39:59,514
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

527
00:39:59,584 --> 00:40:00,607
Nothing, Harry.

528
00:40:00,684 --> 00:40:02,775
It's a fairytale
fucking town, isn't it?

529
00:40:02,851 --> 00:40:05,613
How can a fairytale town
not be somebody's
fucking thing?

530
00:40:05,684 --> 00:40:08,809
How can all those canals
and bridges and cobbled
streets and those churches,

531
00:40:08,884 --> 00:40:11,146
all that beautiful
fucking fairytale stuff,

532
00:40:11,218 --> 00:40:13,116
how can that not be
somebody's fucking thing, eh?

533
00:40:13,185 --> 00:40:14,515
What I think
I meant to say was...

534
00:40:14,585 --> 00:40:16,380
Is the swan still there?
Yeah, the swan's...

535
00:40:16,452 --> 00:40:19,577
How can fucking swans
not fucking be somebody's
fucking thing, eh?

536
00:40:19,652 --> 00:40:20,777
How can that be?

537
00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:21,977
What I think
I meant to say was,

538
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:25,212
when he first arrived,
he wasn't quite sure about it.

539
00:40:25,285 --> 00:40:29,274
You know, there's that big,
dual carriageway when you
get off the train?

540
00:40:29,351 --> 00:40:31,613
It mightn't have been
here when you were
here last, Harry.

541
00:40:31,684 --> 00:40:34,650
Well, as soon as he got into,
like, the old town proper,

542
00:40:34,718 --> 00:40:38,583
and he saw the canals
and the bridges and,
you know, the swans and that,

543
00:40:38,651 --> 00:40:40,584
well, he just
fucking loved it then.

544
00:40:40,652 --> 00:40:44,175
Couldn't get enough of it,
the medieval part of town.

545
00:40:44,251 --> 00:40:48,877
It was just that initial,
dual carriageway thing sort of
put him off for a second.

546
00:40:48,951 --> 00:40:50,645
Don't know if I remember
a dual carriageway.

547
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:52,048
Must be recent.

548
00:40:52,118 --> 00:40:53,482
Hasn't spoilt it, has it?

549
00:40:53,552 --> 00:40:56,814
No, no, no,
it's just that
initial thing.

550
00:40:59,285 --> 00:41:00,979
And you know what?

551
00:41:02,219 --> 00:41:04,343
As we were walking
through the streets,

552
00:41:04,418 --> 00:41:09,578
there was this sort of
freezing fog hanging
over everything,

553
00:41:10,019 --> 00:41:13,815
and it made it
look almost like
a fairytale or something.

554
00:41:13,885 --> 00:41:15,408
And he turned to me,
do you know what he said?

555
00:41:15,486 --> 00:41:17,042
What'd he say?

556
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:22,142
He said, " Ken, I know
I'm awake, but I feel
like I'm in a dream."

557
00:41:22,219 --> 00:41:24,583
Yeah? He said that?

558
00:41:24,653 --> 00:41:25,676
Yeah.

559
00:41:25,753 --> 00:41:28,309
Meaning, like,
in a good dream?

560
00:41:28,385 --> 00:41:31,249
Yeah. Of course,
like in a good dream.

561
00:41:31,318 --> 00:41:34,716
Oh, good. I'm glad
he likes it there.

562
00:41:34,785 --> 00:41:36,751
I'm glad we were able
to give him something.

563
00:41:36,819 --> 00:41:40,649
Something good and happy.
Because he wasn't
a bad kid, was he?

564
00:41:42,086 --> 00:41:43,177
Huh?

565
00:41:43,452 --> 00:41:45,816
He wasn't a bad kid,
was he?

566
00:41:46,919 --> 00:41:49,942
Listen, take down
this address.
Raamstraat 17.

567
00:41:50,019 --> 00:41:53,076
That's "Raam," like "Ram,"
but with an extra "a."

568
00:41:54,052 --> 00:41:55,143
Raamstraat 17.

569
00:41:55,219 --> 00:41:56,810
You got that?

570
00:41:57,186 --> 00:41:58,618
Yes, Raamstraat 17.

571
00:41:58,686 --> 00:42:02,914
Good. There'll be a man
there tomorrow morning
at 9.;00, his name's Yuri.

572
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:04,680
Yuri.
He'll give you the gun.

573
00:42:04,753 --> 00:42:06,651
Ring me on the public phone
at Jimmy Driscoll's

574
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,550
about 3.;00 or 4.;00 tomorrow,
after it's done.

575
00:42:10,519 --> 00:42:12,179
After what's done?

576
00:42:12,886 --> 00:42:14,647
Are you being thick?

577
00:42:16,354 --> 00:42:18,047
No.
Listen, I like Ray.

578
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,517
He was a good bloke,
but when it all comes
down to it, you know,

579
00:42:20,586 --> 00:42:23,677
he blew the head off
a little fucking kid.
And you brought him in, Ken.

580
00:42:23,753 --> 00:42:27,207
So if the buck
don't stop with him,
where does it stop?

581
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,777
Ken?

582
00:42:34,952 --> 00:42:37,316
If the buck
don't stop with him,
where does it stop?

583
00:42:37,386 --> 00:42:39,375
It stops with me, Harry.
That's an easy one.

584
00:42:39,453 --> 00:42:41,578
Look, don't get shirty, Ken.

585
00:42:42,486 --> 00:42:47,418
Listen, I'm just glad that
I was able to do something
for the boy before he went.

586
00:42:47,486 --> 00:42:49,112
Do what for the boy?

587
00:42:49,187 --> 00:42:51,618
You know, have him
get to see Bruges.

588
00:42:52,453 --> 00:42:55,613
I'd like to go to see
Bruges again before I die.

589
00:42:56,387 --> 00:42:59,910
What was it he said
again about... Yeah,
"It's like a dream."

590
00:43:01,686 --> 00:43:04,948
"I know I'm awake,
but I feel like
I'm in a dream."

591
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:08,511
Yeah.

592
00:43:10,387 --> 00:43:12,683
Give me a call
when he's dead.

593
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,308
(GASPS)

594
00:43:36,753 --> 00:43:40,151
That's my fucking girlfriend,
you asshole.

595
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:41,447
Eirik, what are you doing?

596
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,281
Where are you from, fucker?

597
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:44,820
Ireland, originally.

598
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:47,882
And you think it's okay
to come over to Belgium

599
00:43:47,954 --> 00:43:49,715
and fuck another man's girl?

600
00:43:49,787 --> 00:43:51,616
Look, I didn't know
she had a boyfriend,
all right?

601
00:43:51,687 --> 00:43:54,653
And I haven't fucked her,
anyway. Ask her.
I'd only put me hand on it.

602
00:43:54,721 --> 00:43:56,687
Eirik, put the gun down!

603
00:43:57,887 --> 00:44:00,318
Get down on your knees
and open your mouth.

604
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:01,944
Don't start being silly.

605
00:44:02,021 --> 00:44:03,782
Get down on your...

606
00:44:04,687 --> 00:44:08,279
Exactly at what point
was it that all skinheads
suddenly became poofs?

607
00:44:08,355 --> 00:44:09,514
Used to be,
you were a skinhead,

608
00:44:09,587 --> 00:44:11,849
you just went around
beating up
Pakistani 12-year-olds.

609
00:44:11,921 --> 00:44:15,217
Now it seems a prerequisite
to be a fucking bum-boy!

610
00:44:16,755 --> 00:44:17,947
That's not gonna
help you, man.

611
00:44:18,021 --> 00:44:20,783
Ray, there's only
blanks in that gun.

612
00:44:27,354 --> 00:44:29,149
Eirik, don't!

613
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:30,516
Now who's the
fucking bum-boy?

614
00:44:30,587 --> 00:44:32,815

I can't see!

Of course you can't
fucking see! I just shot
a blank in your fucking eyes!

No. I mean, he used to be.

sometimes.

it was too good
to be true!

I knew you'd have never
shagged me, normally.

624
00:44:58,455 --> 00:45:00,683
No! That's not true, I...

625
00:45:00,755 --> 00:45:04,118
I called it off tonight.
I told him not
to come tonight.

626
00:45:04,188 --> 00:45:05,313
Why did you come tonight?

I can't see,
I swear it!

Stop whingeing
like a big gay baby.

629

I haven't had
a shag in months!

630

I can't see out of this eye,
Chloe! I have to go
to the hospital!

I just don't know
how long I'll be.

I just knew someone like you
would never like
someone like me.

I just knew.
What do you mean,
someone like me?

637
00:45:31,188 --> 00:45:33,154
You know, someone nice.

638

Your girlfriend's
very pretty.

She ain't my girlfriend.
She's a prostitute
I just picked up.

00:47:43,256 --> 00:47:45,744
Didn't know there were
any prostitutes in Bruges.

in the right places.

Well, you've picked up
a very pretty prostitute.

657

Thank you.

658

Yeah.

But don't hold it
against me.

661

I'll try not to.

662

Just try not to say
anything too loud or crass.

your sorrows, huh?

How'd your date go?

667
00:48:38,357 --> 00:48:40,585
My date involved
two instances of
extreme violence.

668
00:48:40,657 --> 00:48:42,680
One instance of her hand
on my cock and my finger
up her thing,

669
00:48:42,757 --> 00:48:45,655
which lasted all too briefly.
Isn't that always the way?

670
00:48:45,724 --> 00:48:49,122
One instance of me
stealing five grams of
her very-high-quality cocaine,

671
00:48:49,191 --> 00:48:51,350
and one instance of me
blinding a poofy
little skinhead.

672
00:48:51,424 --> 00:48:54,618
So, all in all,
my evening pretty much
balanced out fine.

673
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:56,781
You got five grams of coke?

674
00:48:57,558 --> 00:48:59,251
I've got four grams on me
and one gram in me,

675
00:48:59,324 --> 00:49:00,620
which is why me heart
is going like the clappers,

676
00:49:00,691 --> 00:49:01,917
as if I'm about to
have a heart attack.

677
00:49:01,991 --> 00:49:04,184
So if I collapse
any minute now, please
remember to tell the doctors

678
00:49:04,257 --> 00:49:05,883
that it might have something
to do with the coke.

679
00:49:05,958 --> 00:49:07,389
Give us a gram, then.

680

laying off, because
it makes you depressed?

You know what?
Right now, I don't
really give a fuck.

682
00:49:41,057 --> 00:49:44,182
Why didn't you wave
hello to me today when
I waved hello to you today?

683
00:49:44,257 --> 00:49:46,815
I was on a very strong
horse tranquilizer today.

684

I wasn't waving
hello to anybody,
except maybe to a horse.

talking about?

hold it against me.

to decide, isn't it?

I came to Bruges.

00:56:28,196 --> 00:56:30,424
"Alcoves"? Yes. Sometimes.

770
00:56:30,496 --> 00:56:34,656
There are not many
people around in these
alcoves in Christmastime.

771
00:56:35,196 --> 00:56:38,526
If I were to murder a man,
I would murder him here.

772

Are you sure this is
the right word, "alcoves"?

773
00:56:44,296 --> 00:56:47,956
"Alcoves," yes.
It's kind of like
"nooks and crannies."

774
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:52,122
"Nooks and crannies," yes.
Perhaps this would be
more accurate.

775
00:56:52,196 --> 00:56:55,594
"Nooks and crannies,"
rather than "alcoves." Yeah.

776
00:57:01,930 --> 00:57:06,363
You are going to do it,
aren't you? Mr. Waters
will be very disappointed...

777
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:09,021
Of course I'm going to
fucking do it.

778
00:57:10,564 --> 00:57:12,120
It's what I do.

779
00:57:18,397 --> 00:57:21,659
Your friend was behaving
rather oddly this morning.

780
00:57:29,130 --> 00:57:30,652
Oddly? How?

781
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:34,856
Well, he asked me
about the baby, and if
I wanted a boy or a girl.

782
00:57:35,696 --> 00:57:39,094
I said I didn't mind
as long as it's
healthy, of course.

783
00:57:39,163 --> 00:57:43,493
But then he gave me 200 euros
to give to the baby.

784
00:57:44,997 --> 00:57:49,895
I refused, obviously,
but he was quite insistent.

785
00:57:51,731 --> 00:57:54,788
Would you give it
back to him when
you see him?

786
00:57:55,530 --> 00:57:59,553
I don't want to appear
ungrateful, but it seemed
like all the money he had.

787
00:57:59,630 --> 00:58:03,619
Do you know where he is now?
He said he was
going to the park.

788
00:59:03,164 --> 00:59:04,528
Sorry, Ray.

789
00:59:06,431 --> 00:59:07,795
I'm sorry.

790
00:59:38,465 --> 00:59:39,658
Ray, don't!

791
00:59:39,732 --> 00:59:42,323
Fucking hell!
Where the fuck
did you come from?

792
00:59:42,398 --> 00:59:45,387

you doing, Ray?

are you doing?

794

and talk about this, please?

through with it, Ray.

You fucking looked like
you were gonna go
fucking through with it.

You're not getting it back.

You're a suicide case.

trying to shoot me
in the fucking head.

01:10:39,539 --> 01:10:41,902
I knew he wouldn't
kill the guy.

925
01:10:41,972 --> 01:10:46,132
I could see it in his eyes
when I was telling him
about the alcoves.

926
01:10:47,339 --> 01:10:48,929
About the what?
The alcoves.

927
01:10:49,006 --> 01:10:51,768
The alcoves in the
Koningin Astrid Park.

928
01:10:54,406 --> 01:10:56,634
Oh, I also have
some dumdums.

929
01:10:56,706 --> 01:11:00,160
You use this word,
"dumdums"? The bullets
that make the head explode?

930
01:11:00,239 --> 01:11:01,603
Dumdums, yeah.

931
01:11:01,673 --> 01:11:04,265
Would you like some
of these dumdums?

932
01:11:04,773 --> 01:11:06,534
I know I shouldn't,

933
01:11:08,173 --> 01:11:09,536
but I will.

934
01:11:14,540 --> 01:11:16,005
Motherfucker.

935
01:11:17,307 --> 01:11:18,330
Is he talking to me?

936
01:11:18,407 --> 01:11:20,566
No, Eirik's
on your side,
Mr. Waters.

937
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:22,663
Your young friend
blinded him last night.

938
01:11:22,741 --> 01:11:23,798
Ray did?

939
01:11:23,873 --> 01:11:27,168
I was trying to rob him
and he took my gun from me.

940
01:11:28,439 --> 01:11:30,803
And the gun
was full of blanks,

941
01:11:30,873 --> 01:11:32,498
and he shot the blank
into my eye.

942
01:11:33,606 --> 01:11:38,164
And now, I cannot see
from this eye ever again,
the doctors say.

943
01:11:38,873 --> 01:11:42,203
Well, to be honest,
it sounds like
it was all your fault.

944
01:11:42,273 --> 01:11:43,296
What?

945
01:11:43,374 --> 01:11:46,169
I mean, basically, if you're
robbing a man and you're
only carrying blanks,

946
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:48,172
and you allow your gun
to be taken off you,

947
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:50,468
and you allow yourself
to be shot in the
eye with a blank,

948
01:11:50,540 --> 01:11:54,097
for which I assume
the person has to get
quite close to you, then,

949
01:11:54,173 --> 01:11:57,435
yeah, really,
it's all your fault
for being such a poof.

950
01:11:57,507 --> 01:12:00,439
So why don't you
stop whingeing
and cheer the fuck up?

951
01:12:00,507 --> 01:12:03,064
YURl: Eirik, I really
wouldn't respond.

952
01:12:10,207 --> 01:12:11,400
I thought you wanted
the guy dead?

953
01:12:11,474 --> 01:12:13,599
I do want the guy dead.
I want him fucking crucified.

954
01:12:13,674 --> 01:12:16,970
But it don't change the fact
that he stitched you up like
a blind, little gay boy.

955
01:12:17,041 --> 01:12:18,064
Does it?

956
01:12:20,008 --> 01:12:21,997
Thanks for the gun, Yuri.

957
01:13:28,941 --> 01:13:30,032
Well?

958
01:13:32,174 --> 01:13:34,106
The boy is suicidal, Harry.

959
01:13:34,174 --> 01:13:36,163
He's a walking dead man.

960
01:13:37,008 --> 01:13:38,997
Keeps going on
about Hell and purgatory...

961
01:13:39,074 --> 01:13:41,472
When I phoned you
yesterday, did I ask you,

962
01:13:41,541 --> 01:13:45,098
"Ken, will you do me
a favor and become
Ray's psychiatrist, please?"

963
01:13:45,174 --> 01:13:49,664
No. What I think I asked you
was, " Could you go blow
his fucking head off for me?"

964
01:13:49,742 --> 01:13:51,731
"He's suicidal"?

965
01:13:51,808 --> 01:13:55,296
I'm suicidal. You're suicidal.
Everybody's fucking suicidal!

966
01:13:55,375 --> 01:13:57,568
We don't all keep
going on about it!

967
01:13:57,641 --> 01:14:02,006
Has he killed himself yet?
No. So he's not
fucking suicidal, is he?

968
01:14:02,075 --> 01:14:04,472
He put a loaded gun
to his head this morning.
I stopped him.

969
01:14:04,541 --> 01:14:07,064
He... What?
This gets fucking worse!

970
01:14:07,975 --> 01:14:09,066
We were down in the park...

971
01:14:09,142 --> 01:14:13,097
Let me get this right.
You were down in the park?

972
01:14:13,175 --> 01:14:15,300
What's that got to do
with fucking anything?

973
01:14:15,376 --> 01:14:18,240
Let me get this right.
Not only have you
refused to kill the boy,

974
01:14:18,309 --> 01:14:20,502
you've even stopped the boy
from killing himself,

975
01:14:20,576 --> 01:14:21,837
which would have
solved my problem,

976
01:14:21,908 --> 01:14:23,169
which would have
solved your problem,

977
01:14:23,242 --> 01:14:25,140
which sounds like
it would've solved
the boy's problem.

978
01:14:25,209 --> 01:14:26,834
It wouldn't have
solved his problem.

979
01:14:26,908 --> 01:14:30,863
Ken, if I had
killed a little kid,
accidentally or otherwise,

980
01:14:30,942 --> 01:14:32,168
I wouldn't have
thought twice.

981
01:14:32,241 --> 01:14:34,764
I'd have killed myself
on the fucking spot.
On the fucking spot.

982
01:14:34,842 --> 01:14:37,501
I'd have stuck
the gun in me mouth
on the fucking spot!

983
01:14:37,575 --> 01:14:41,201
That's you, Harry.
The boy has the
capacity to change.

984
01:14:41,275 --> 01:14:43,740
The boy has the capacity
to do something
decent with his life.

985
01:14:43,808 --> 01:14:47,241
Excuse me, Ken.
I have the capacity
to change.

986
01:14:48,009 --> 01:14:51,567
Yeah, you do.
You've the capacity
to get fucking worse!

987
01:14:52,175 --> 01:14:54,664
Yeah, now I'm
getting down to it!

988
01:14:54,743 --> 01:14:56,641
Harry, let's face it.

989
01:14:56,709 --> 01:14:59,402
And I'm not being funny,
I mean no disrespect,

990
01:14:59,476 --> 01:15:00,908
but you're a cunt.

991
01:15:00,975 --> 01:15:03,806
You're a cunt now,
you've always been a cunt.

992
01:15:03,876 --> 01:15:07,603
And the only thing that's
gonna change is you're gonna
become an even bigger cunt.

993
01:15:07,676 --> 01:15:09,165
Maybe have some
more cunt kids.

994
01:15:09,242 --> 01:15:11,333
Leave my kids
fucking out of it.
What have they done?

995
01:15:11,409 --> 01:15:13,841
You fucking retract that bit
about my cunt fucking kids!

996
01:15:13,909 --> 01:15:16,171
I retract that bit about
your cunt fucking kids.

997
01:15:16,243 --> 01:15:19,936
Insulting my fucking kids!
That's going overboard, mate!

998
01:15:20,010 --> 01:15:21,999
I retracted it, didn't I?

999
01:15:25,210 --> 01:15:26,233
Still leaves you
being a cunt.

1000
01:15:26,310 --> 01:15:28,866
Yeah, I fucking got that.

1001

Where's Ray now?

1002

Ray is in one or other

fucking wind me up?
No, Harry.

about, please.

1073
01:20:59,213 --> 01:21:01,270
Pick up your gun.
I know I'm going
to beat you anyway

1074
01:21:01,346 --> 01:21:03,972
'Cause you're a spaz, but...
Harry,

1075
01:21:05,513 --> 01:21:07,536
I'm totally in your debt.

1076
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:13,605
The things that have
gone between us in the past,

1077
01:21:14,314 --> 01:21:16,109
I love you
unreservedly
for all that.

1078
01:21:16,180 --> 01:21:17,339
What?

1079
01:21:18,314 --> 01:21:20,041
For your integrity.

1080
01:21:21,014 --> 01:21:22,571
For your honor.

1081
01:21:23,481 --> 01:21:24,878
I love you.

1082
01:21:27,313 --> 01:21:29,677
The boy had to be let go.

1083
01:21:32,079 --> 01:21:34,477
The boy had to be
given a chance.

1084
01:21:34,980 --> 01:21:40,435
And if to do that,
I had to say, " Fuck you,
and fuck what I owe you,

1085
01:21:40,513 --> 01:21:45,242
"and fuck everything
that's gone on between us,"
then that's what I had to do.

1086
01:21:45,713 --> 01:21:47,702
But I'm not fighting you.

1087
01:21:49,247 --> 01:21:51,338
And I accept, totally,
everything you've got to do.

1088
01:21:51,414 --> 01:21:53,243
I accept it. Totally.

1089
01:21:57,080 --> 01:21:58,341
Oh, yeah?

1090
01:22:00,647 --> 01:22:01,738
Yeah.

1091
01:22:06,781 --> 01:22:11,372
Well, you say all that
fucking stuff, I can't
fucking shoot you now, can I?

1092
01:22:12,748 --> 01:22:15,237
It's entirely
up to you, Harry.

1093
01:22:15,314 --> 01:22:17,304
It's entirely your call.

1094
01:22:18,881 --> 01:22:21,711
All I'm saying is
I'm not fighting.

1095
01:22:29,114 --> 01:22:30,704
Oh, you fucking cunt!

1096
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:32,007
Look, I'm not gonna
do nothing to you

1097
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:35,876
just 'Cause you're
standing about like
Robert fucking Powell.

1098

fucking Nazareth!

turns out to just be
a loveable little schoolboy,

1102
01:22:46,147 --> 01:22:48,670
and it's all some kind of
Boschian nightmare.

1103
01:22:48,748 --> 01:22:50,237
Kiss my ass!

1104
01:22:50,314 --> 01:22:54,474
I guess at least there
weren't any black people
involved, eh, Jimmy?

1105
01:22:55,748 --> 01:22:57,112
I wasn't...

1106
01:22:57,948 --> 01:22:59,971
I wasn't talking about...

1107
01:23:01,148 --> 01:23:04,171
There's gonna be a war
between all the blacks
and all the whites.

1108
01:23:04,248 --> 01:23:06,043
And all the black midgets
and all the white midgets,

1109
01:23:06,115 --> 01:23:08,274
which would actually
be really good.

1110
01:23:08,348 --> 01:23:10,109
That's just cocaine.

good for once.

You guys should come along.

1116

gonna have a quiet one
tonight, Jimmy.

My room faces
onto the canal, right?

1179
01:34:44,456 --> 01:34:47,149
I'm gonna go back to me room,
jump into the canal,

1180
01:34:47,223 --> 01:34:49,314
see if I can swim
to the other side
and escape.

1181
01:34:49,390 --> 01:34:51,618
Right.
If you go outside
and round the corner,

1182
01:34:51,689 --> 01:34:54,053
you can shoot at me
from there and try
and get me.

1183
01:34:54,123 --> 01:34:56,589
That way, we leave this lady
and her baby out of
the whole, entire thing.

1184
01:34:56,656 --> 01:34:58,985
Do you completely promise
to jump into the canal?

1185
01:34:59,056 --> 01:35:00,852

run out there,
come back in 10 minutes

and find you fucking
hiding in a cupboard.

I completely promise, Harry.

1188
01:35:03,923 --> 01:35:06,252
I'm not gonna risk
having another
little kid die, am I?

1189
01:35:06,323 --> 01:35:10,483

then I go which way,
right or left?

01:35:10,556 --> 01:35:12,022

don't you?

got here, haven't I?

to your principles.

RAY. ; There's a Christmas tree
somewhere in London

1213
01:40:05,460 --> 01:40:09,358
with a bunch of presents
underneath it that'll
never be opened.

1214
01:40:09,993 --> 01:40:13,982

"If I survive all this,
I'll go to that house,

1215
01:40:14,060 --> 01:40:15,822
"apologize to
the mother there,

punishment she chose for me."

Prison, death,
it didn't matter.

1218
01:40:24,093 --> 01:40:27,388
Because at least in prison
and at least in death,
you know,

1219
01:40:27,459 --> 01:40:29,823
I wouldn't be
in fucking Bruges.

1220
01:40:32,293 --> 01:40:36,350

it came to me, and I realized,

"Fuck, man, maybe
that's what Hell is.
