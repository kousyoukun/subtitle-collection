1
00:00:56,601 --> 00:01:00,701
RAY. ; After I killed them, I dropped the gun in the Thames,

2
00:01:00,701 --> 00:01:03,901
washed the residue off me hands in the bathroom of a Burger King,

3
00:01:03,901 --> 00:01:06,662
and walked home to await instructions.

4
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:10,533
Shortly thereafter, the instructions came through.

5
00:01:11,235 --> 00:01:14,634
"Get the fuck out of London, youse dumb fucks.

6
00:01:14,634 --> 00:01:17,032
"Get to Bruges."

7
00:01:17,834 --> 00:01:20,392
I didn't even know where Bruges fucking was.

8
00:01:24,901 --> 00:01:27,129
It's in Belgium.

9
00:01:29,034 --> 00:01:30,168


10
00:01:30,168 --> 00:01:31,501
RAY. ; Bruges is a shithole.

11
00:01:31,501 --> 00:01:32,667
KEN. ; Bruges is not a shithole.

12
00:01:32,667 --> 00:01:33,634
Bruges is a shithole.

13
00:01:33,634 --> 00:01:35,801
Ray, we've only just got off the fucking train.

14
00:01:35,801 --> 00:01:38,868
Could we reserve judgment on Bruges until we've seen the fucking place?

15
00:01:38,868 --> 00:01:40,458
I know it's gonna be a shithole.

16
00:02:08,801 --> 00:02:10,267
(SOFTLY) Shithole.

17
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:17,701
I think you have a couple of rooms booked

18
00:02:17,701 --> 00:02:19,834
under Cranham and Blakely?

19
00:02:19,834 --> 00:02:23,101
Yes. No, we have one room booked.

20
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:23,667
No

21
00:02:23,667 --> 00:02:25,301
One twin room.

22
00:02:25,301 --> 00:02:27,068
Booked for two weeks.

23
00:02:27,068 --> 00:02:28,863
Two weeks!

24
00:02:29,301 --> 00:02:30,335
Do you have another room?

25
00:02:30,335 --> 00:02:33,400
No, I'm afraid we're fully booked.

26
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,834
With Christmas, everywhere is fully booked.

27
00:02:35,834 --> 00:02:37,459
Okay.

28
00:02:42,335 --> 00:02:43,868
It's very pretty.

29
00:02:43,868 --> 00:02:45,501
I'm not being funny, we can't stay here.

30
00:02:45,501 --> 00:02:47,467
We've got to stay here until he rings.

31
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:48,968
Well, what if he doesn't ring for two weeks?

32
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:50,567
Then we stay here for two weeks.

33
00:02:50,567 --> 00:02:51,934
For two weeks?

34
00:02:51,934 --> 00:02:53,235
In fucking Bruges?

35
00:02:53,235 --> 00:02:55,534
In a room like this?With you?

36
00:02:55,534 --> 00:02:56,134
No way!

37
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:59,001
Ray, I really don't like to say this...

38
00:02:59,001 --> 00:03:01,126
You really don't like to say what?

39
00:03:01,367 --> 00:03:03,765
Well... You know?

40
00:03:05,701 --> 00:03:07,758
Fucking bring that up.

41
00:03:44,001 --> 00:03:46,168
Do you think this is good?

42
00:03:46,168 --> 00:03:48,334
Do I think what's good?

43
00:03:48,334 --> 00:03:51,391
You know, going round in a boat, looking at stuff.

44
00:03:52,267 --> 00:03:54,961
Yes, I do.

45
00:03:55,601 --> 00:03:57,658
It's called "sightseeing."

46
00:04:07,634 --> 00:04:09,429
Oh, look at that.

47
00:04:12,501 --> 00:04:14,868
It's a former hospital.

48
00:04:14,868 --> 00:04:17,096
From the 1100s.

49
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:20,634
Bruges is the most well-preserved medieval town

50
00:04:20,634 --> 00:04:23,691
in the whole of Belgium, apparently.

51
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:47,367
Coming up?

52
00:04:47,367 --> 00:04:49,234
What's up there?

53
00:04:49,234 --> 00:04:50,968
The view.

54
00:04:50,968 --> 00:04:52,068
The view of what?

55
00:04:52,068 --> 00:04:54,767
The view of down here? I can see that from down here.

56
00:04:54,767 --> 00:04:59,101
Ray, you're about the worst tourist in the whole world.

57
00:04:59,101 --> 00:05:01,300
Ken, I grew up in Dublin.

58
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,667
I love Dublin.

59
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:05,434
If I'd grown up on a farm and was retarded,

60
00:05:05,434 --> 00:05:06,400
Bruges might impress me.

61
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,195
But I didn't, so it doesn't.

62
00:05:21,068 --> 00:05:23,034
Trying to get rid of me coins.

63
00:05:23,267 --> 00:05:26,367
3, 3.50, 4,

64
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:29,334
4.10, 4.20, 4.30,

65
00:05:29,334 --> 00:05:31,968
4.40, 4.50, 4.60,

66
00:05:31,968 --> 00:05:34,300
4.70,

67
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,562
4.80,

68
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,689
4.90.

69
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,332
Will you take 4.90?

70
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:45,998
Entry is 5 euro.

71
00:05:46,868 --> 00:05:48,663
Come on, man, it's only 10 cents.

72
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,732
Entry is 5 euro.

73
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:03,467
Happy in your work?

74
00:06:03,467 --> 00:06:05,365
Very happy.

75
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:42,562
I like it here.

76
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,701
MAN: Been to the top of the tower?

77
00:07:12,701 --> 00:07:14,100
Yeah. Yeah,

78
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,267
 it's rubbish.

79
00:07:16,267 --> 00:07:17,601
It is? 

80
00:07:17,601 --> 00:07:20,267
The guidebook says it's a "must-see".

81
00:07:20,267 --> 00:07:22,968
Well, you lot ain't going up there.

82
00:07:22,968 --> 00:07:24,667
Pardon me? Why?

83
00:07:24,667 --> 00:07:28,534
I mean, it's all windy stairs. I'm not being funny.

84
00:07:28,534 --> 00:07:31,295
What exactly are you trying to say?

85
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,968
What exactly am I trying to say?

86
00:07:33,968 --> 00:07:36,434
Youse are a bunch of fucking elephants!

87
00:07:36,434 --> 00:07:37,832
Right, you...

88
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,259
Come on, leave it, fatty.

89
00:07:56,701 --> 00:07:58,701
You know, you're just the rudest man.

90
00:07:58,701 --> 00:08:00,599
The rudest man!

91
00:08:01,868 --> 00:08:03,595
What's all that about?

92
00:08:04,868 --> 00:08:06,100
They're not going up there.

93
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,801
Hey, guys, I wouldn't go up there.

94
00:08:08,801 --> 00:08:09,567
It's really narrow.

95
00:08:09,567 --> 00:08:12,362
Screw you, motherfucker!

96
00:08:14,934 --> 00:08:17,126
Americans, isn't it?

97
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:24,767
Now, this is more like it. Proper holidays.

98
00:08:24,767 --> 00:08:26,434
One gay beer for my gay friend,

99
00:08:26,434 --> 00:08:29,298
and one normal beer for me, because I am normal.

100
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,701
This is the life.

101
00:08:31,701 --> 00:08:34,064
We're not staying here getting pissed.

102
00:08:34,701 --> 00:08:36,667
We are quietly sightseeing, like he says,

103
00:08:36,667 --> 00:08:39,334
and awaiting his call to see what we do next.

104
00:08:39,334 --> 00:08:41,334
This is my vote on what we should do.

105
00:08:41,334 --> 00:08:42,667
We give it another day,

106
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:44,601
two days, max.

107
00:08:44,601 --> 00:08:46,868
Then we check the papers again, and if there's still nothing in them,

108
00:08:46,868 --> 00:08:48,267
we phone him and say,

109
00:08:48,267 --> 00:08:50,400
"Harry, thank you for the trip to Bruges,

110
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,367
"it's been very nice, all the old buildings and that,

111
00:08:52,367 --> 00:08:54,434
"but we're coming back to London now, 

112
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:57,868
and hide out in a proper country,"where it isn't all just fucking chocolates."

113
00:08:57,868 --> 00:08:59,434
My vote would be

114
00:08:59,434 --> 00:09:02,167
we quietly sightsee, like he says,

115
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:05,258
and await his call to see what we do next.

116
00:09:07,901 --> 00:09:10,833
You don't even know we're here hiding out.

117
00:09:12,467 --> 00:09:13,967
What are you talking about?

118
00:09:13,967 --> 00:09:16,334
You don't even know we're not here on a job.

119
00:09:16,334 --> 00:09:17,467
What, on a job?

120
00:09:17,467 --> 00:09:18,434
Yeah.

121
00:09:18,434 --> 00:09:19,100
Here in Bruges?

122
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:19,967
Yeah.

123
00:09:19,967 --> 00:09:21,501
Here in Bruges, on a job?

124
00:09:21,501 --> 00:09:23,200
Yeah.

125
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,967
Why? What did he actually say?

126
00:09:24,967 --> 00:09:26,501
He didn't actually say anything.

127
00:09:26,501 --> 00:09:27,567
Then why do you think it might be?

128
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,200
I don't think anything.

129
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,300
But it's a bit fucking over-elaborate, isn't it?

130
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,367
"Go take him to hide out."

131
00:09:33,367 --> 00:09:34,967
"Go take him to hide out where?"

132
00:09:34,967 --> 00:09:38,127
"Go take him to hide out in fucking Bruges."

133
00:09:39,367 --> 00:09:41,595
You can hide out in Croydon.

134
00:09:44,967 --> 00:09:47,126
Or Coventry.

135
00:09:51,933 --> 00:09:54,832
It is a bit over-elaborate.

136
00:09:58,434 --> 00:09:59,834
But we haven't got any guns.

137
00:09:59,834 --> 00:10:02,231
Harry can get guns anywhere.

138
00:10:24,367 --> 00:10:26,799
He's not gonna ring tonight.

139
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,995
He's not gonna ring tonight.

140
00:10:36,933 --> 00:10:38,467
Let's go out.

141
00:10:38,467 --> 00:10:39,534
Go out where?

142
00:10:39,534 --> 00:10:40,567
The pub.

143
00:10:40,567 --> 00:10:42,089
No!

144
00:10:59,933 --> 00:11:04,567
Let's go out and have a look at some of the All the old medieval buildings and that.

145
00:11:04,567 --> 00:11:07,795
Because I bet they look even better at night, all lit up.

146
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:14,223
Yes!

147
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:25,892
That there is called the Gruuthuse Museum.

148
00:11:26,334 --> 00:11:28,434
They all have funny names, don't they?

149
00:11:28,434 --> 00:11:30,696
Yes, Flemish.

150
00:11:31,267 --> 00:11:32,000
In here it says,

151
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,767
"The Belgians twice sheltered fugitive English Kings

152
00:11:34,767 --> 00:11:36,867
"from being murdered, 1471 and 1651."

153
00:11:36,867 --> 00:11:39,400
I used to hate history, didn't you?

154
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,767
It's all just a load of stuff that's already happened.

155
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:43,255
What are they doing over there?

156
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:44,933
They're filming something.

157
00:11:44,933 --> 00:11:46,627
They're filming midgets!

158
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,091
Ray!

159
00:11:51,767 --> 00:11:55,892
MAN: So, on this scene, you're supposed to walk like a little, tiny mouse, yeah?

160
00:11:59,601 --> 00:12:01,692
Okay? Great.

161
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,133
Ray, come on, let's go.

162
00:12:06,133 --> 00:12:08,860
My arse, "Let's go." They're filming midgets.

163
00:12:10,501 --> 00:12:13,967
Oh, my God! Look at that girl.

164
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:15,300
She's gorgeous!

165
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,501
Ray, we're going right now.

166
00:12:16,501 --> 00:12:18,100
Fuck off, are we!

167
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,067
This is the best bit of Bruges so far.

168
00:12:20,067 --> 00:12:21,658
You and your buildings.

169
00:12:46,601 --> 00:12:47,827
Hello.

170
00:12:50,501 --> 00:12:51,830
Do you speak English?

171
00:12:52,501 --> 00:12:53,833
No.

172
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,701
Yes, you do.

173
00:12:55,701 --> 00:12:57,234
Everybody does.

174
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:59,200
What are you filming midgets for?

175
00:12:59,766 --> 00:13:01,100
It's a Dutch movie.

176
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:04,300
It's a dream sequence.

177
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,534
It's a pastiche of Nicholas Roeg's Don't Look Now.

178
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:07,534
Not a pastiche, but a...

179
00:13:07,534 --> 00:13:12,267
A"homage" is too strong.

180
00:13:12,267 --> 00:13:14,631
A"nod of the head"?

181
00:13:15,667 --> 00:13:17,996
Wow, your English is very good.

182
00:13:22,467 --> 00:13:24,626
A lot of midgets tend to kill themselves.

183
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:30,289
A disproportionate amount.

184
00:13:30,733 --> 00:13:34,166
Herve Villechaize, off of Fantasy Island.

185
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,364
I think somebody off The Time Bandits.

186
00:13:37,867 --> 00:13:39,967
I suppose they must

187
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:42,434
get really sad about, like,

188
00:13:42,434 --> 00:13:44,234
being really little and that.

189
00:13:44,234 --> 00:13:46,933
People looking at them and laughing at them.

190
00:13:46,933 --> 00:13:48,263
Calling them names.

191
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,729
You know, "shortarse."

192
00:13:51,933 --> 00:13:53,800
There's another famous

193
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,789
midget I'm missing, but I can't remember.

194
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,567
It's not the R2-D2 man.

195
00:13:58,567 --> 00:14:00,192
No, he's still going.

196
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,267
I hope your midget doesn't kill himself. 

197
00:14:03,267 --> 00:14:04,823
Your dream sequence will be fucked.

198
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,267
He doesn't like being called a midget.

199
00:14:08,267 --> 00:14:09,200
He prefers "dwarf."

200
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,927
Well, this is exactly my point!

201
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:12,601
People go around calling you a midget 

202
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,430
when you want to be called a dwarf.

203
00:14:14,867 --> 00:14:16,265
Of course you're gonna blow your head off!

204
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,434
My name's Ray. What's yours?

205
00:14:21,434 --> 00:14:22,694
Chloe.

206
00:14:24,601 --> 00:14:26,400
How did you get past the security man?

207
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,332
Getting past security men,

208
00:14:28,633 --> 00:14:29,867
it's sort of my job.

209
00:14:29,867 --> 00:14:30,867
You're a shoplifter?

210
00:14:30,867 --> 00:14:32,493
(CHUCKLES) No, not a shoplifter.

211
00:14:33,167 --> 00:14:34,428
It's a good joke, though.

212
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,127
No.

213
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,000
I'll tell you 

214
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,966
what I am at dinner tomorrow night.

215
00:14:56,867 --> 00:14:58,197
Fuck.

216
00:15:07,766 --> 00:15:09,595


217
00:15:11,133 --> 00:15:12,792
How fucking cool.

218
00:15:23,733 --> 00:15:25,501
Mr. Blakely?

219
00:15:25,501 --> 00:15:27,300
Yes. No, Mr. Cranham.

220
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,459
No. Yes. Mr. Blakely. Yes.

221
00:15:32,267 --> 00:15:33,698
You have a message.

222
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,558
Shit!

223
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,167
HARRY. ; Number one, why aren't you in when

224
00:15:43,167 --> 00:15:44,600
I fucking told you to be in?

225
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,534
Number two, why doesn't this hotel

226
00:15:46,534 --> 00:15:47,933
 have phones with fucking voicemail

227
00:15:47,933 --> 00:15:50,600
and not I have to leave messages with the fucking receptionist?

228
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,334
Number three, you better fucking be in tomorrow night

229
00:15:52,334 --> 00:15:53,733
when I fucking call again

230
00:15:53,733 --> 00:15:54,867
or there'll be fucking Hell to pay, 

231
00:15:54,867 --> 00:15:55,900
I'm fucking telling you. 

232
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,558
Harry.

233
00:15:59,367 --> 00:16:01,434


234
00:16:01,434 --> 00:16:04,501


235
00:16:04,501 --> 00:16:05,489


236
00:16:34,933 --> 00:16:37,229
Would you turn the fucking light off!

237
00:16:37,733 --> 00:16:38,664
Sorry, Ken.

238
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,859
Keep the fucking noise down!

239
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,865
Someone's in a mood.

240
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:01,833
(SOFTLY) You'll never guess what. Will you shut your

241
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:04,560
fucking mouth, please, and go to sleep?

242
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:06,192
Oh, sorry.

243
00:17:10,133 --> 00:17:12,429
Except I've gotta take me contact lenses out.

244
00:17:20,267 --> 00:17:21,800
Altogether,

245
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,493
I had

246
00:17:24,466 --> 00:17:25,796
five pints of beer

247
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,956
and six bottles.

248
00:17:28,967 --> 00:17:29,990
No.

249
00:17:31,533 --> 00:17:33,434
 Six pints of beer and seven bottles.

250
00:17:33,434 --> 00:17:35,695
And you know what? I'm not even pissed!

251
00:17:41,733 --> 00:17:43,131
You'll never guess what, Ken.

252
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:46,967
Ken, you'll never guess what.

253
00:17:46,967 --> 00:17:48,067
What?

254
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,300
Got a date for tomorrow night.

255
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,334
I'm very happy for you.

256
00:17:50,334 --> 00:17:51,500
With a girl.

257
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,967
Can you turn the light off, please?

258
00:17:52,967 --> 00:17:53,933
Only been in Bruges one day,

259
00:17:53,933 --> 00:17:55,700
got a date with a girl in the film business,

260
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,098
the Belgian film business.

261
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,829
They're doing a film about a midget.

262
00:18:19,234 --> 00:18:20,824
Miss?

263
00:18:21,933 --> 00:18:23,194
Marie?

264
00:18:25,967 --> 00:18:28,466
Sorry about the message last night. 

265
00:18:28,466 --> 00:18:30,365
The man who left it is a bit of a...

266
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,061
Well, he's a bit of a...

267
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,422
Cock?

268
00:18:37,167 --> 00:18:39,428
Yes. He's a bit of a cock.

269
00:18:42,466 --> 00:18:43,659
Morning.

270
00:18:53,033 --> 00:18:54,760
Harry called last night.

271
00:18:55,633 --> 00:18:56,621
We missed him.

272
00:18:59,933 --> 00:19:01,762
Jeez, he swears a lot, doesn't he?

273
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,759
We're staying in tonight.

274
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,932
Whatever happens.

275
00:19:09,766 --> 00:19:11,096
Except...

276
00:19:14,967 --> 00:19:16,900
Except "hmm" what?

277
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,967
Except only one of us needs to stay in, really.

278
00:19:20,967 --> 00:19:22,865
Uh-huh.

279
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,200
And which one of us would that be, now, Ray?

280
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,766
I thought you didn't like Bruges.

281
00:19:28,766 --> 00:19:30,466
I don't like Bruges, it's a shithole.

282
00:19:30,466 --> 00:19:33,333
But I did already say

283
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:36,033
I had a date with a Belgian lady in the Belgian film business,

284
00:19:36,033 --> 00:19:38,295
which I did already say about before.

285
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:44,796
Just don't get into any fucking trouble.

286
00:19:45,733 --> 00:19:47,892
We're keeping a low profile.

287
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,300
And this morning,

288
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,366
and this afternoon,

289
00:19:52,366 --> 00:19:55,466
we are doing what I want to do.

290
00:19:55,466 --> 00:19:57,433
Got it? Of course.

291
00:19:57,433 --> 00:19:59,366
Which, I presume, will involve culture.

292
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:03,133
Oh, we shall strike a balance between culture and fun.

293
00:20:03,133 --> 00:20:04,933
Somehow I believe, Ken, that the balance

294
00:20:04,933 --> 00:20:07,831
 shall tip in the favor of culture.

295
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,533
Like a big, fat, fucking retarded,

296
00:20:11,533 --> 00:20:14,167
fucking black girl

297
00:20:14,167 --> 00:20:16,394
on a seesaw, opposite

298
00:20:19,067 --> 00:20:20,692
a dwarf.

299
00:20:56,399 --> 00:20:59,133
(SOFTLY) Ray, did we or did we not agree

300
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:00,833
that if I let you go on your date tonight,

301
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:02,700
we'd do the things I wanted to do today?

302
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,566
We are doing the things that you wanted to do today.

303
00:21:04,566 --> 00:21:07,067
And that we'd do them without you throwing a fucking moody,

304
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:09,633
like some 5-year-old who's dropped all his sweets?

305
00:21:09,633 --> 00:21:11,031
I didn't agree to that.

306
00:21:12,566 --> 00:21:14,123
I'll cheer up. I'll cheer up.

307
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,299
Up there, the top altar,

308
00:21:17,299 --> 00:21:18,900
is a phial

309
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,299
brought back by a Flemish knight 

310
00:21:22,299 --> 00:21:23,733
from the Crusades in the Holy Land.

311
00:21:23,733 --> 00:21:24,967
And that phial,

312
00:21:24,967 --> 00:21:26,600
do you know what it's said to contain?

313
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,566
No, what's it said to contain?

314
00:21:27,566 --> 00:21:30,500
It's said to contain some drops of Jesus Christ's blood.

315
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,766
Yeah, that's how this church got its name.

316
00:21:32,766 --> 00:21:34,399
Basilica of the Holy Blood.

317
00:21:34,399 --> 00:21:35,266
Yeah. Yeah.

318
00:21:35,266 --> 00:21:37,167
And this blood, right,

319
00:21:37,167 --> 00:21:38,900
though it's dried blood,

320
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,967
at different times over many years, 

321
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:43,000
they say it turned back into liquid.

322
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,666
Turned back into liquid from dried blood.

323
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:48,359
At various times of great

324
00:21:49,366 --> 00:21:50,733
stress.

325
00:21:50,733 --> 00:21:51,500
Yeah? Yeah.

326
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,333
So, yeah, 

327
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:56,731
I'm gonna go up in the queue and touch it, which is what you do.

328
00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:58,067
Yeah?

329
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:00,366
Yeah. You coming?

330
00:22:00,366 --> 00:22:01,696
Do I have to?

331
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,864
Do you have to?

332
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,466
Of course you don't have to.

333
00:22:06,466 --> 00:22:08,533
It's Jesus' fucking blood, isn't it? 

334
00:22:08,533 --> 00:22:10,333
Of course you don't fucking have to!

335
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:12,424
Of course you don't fucking have to!

336
00:22:56,766 --> 00:22:58,857
You little fucking cunt.

337
00:23:31,633 --> 00:23:34,031
RAY. ; Murder, Father.

338
00:23:35,099 --> 00:23:36,656
PRIEST. ; Why did you murder someone, Raymond?

339
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,366
For money, Father.

340
00:23:41,366 --> 00:23:42,491
For money?

341
00:23:43,967 --> 00:23:46,000
You murdered someone for money?

342
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Yes, Father.

343
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,433
Not out of anger, not out of nothing.

344
00:23:49,433 --> 00:23:50,660
For money.

345
00:23:52,433 --> 00:23:55,025
Who did you murder for money, Raymond?

346
00:23:56,266 --> 00:23:57,664
You, Father.

347
00:23:59,766 --> 00:24:00,867
I'm sorry?

348
00:24:00,867 --> 00:24:02,233
I said you, Father.

349
00:24:02,233 --> 00:24:04,033
What, are you deaf?

350
00:24:04,033 --> 00:24:05,692
Harry Waters says hello.

351
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,891
The little boy.

352
00:24:55,733 --> 00:24:56,766


353
00:24:56,766 --> 00:24:57,900


354
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:58,888


355
00:26:11,399 --> 00:26:12,955
RAY: I quite like this one.

356
00:26:13,733 --> 00:26:15,533
All the rest were rubbish by spastics,

357
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:17,089
but this one's quite good.

358
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,331
What's that all about, then?

359
00:26:21,099 --> 00:26:23,800
It's Judgment Day, you know?

360
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,265
Oh, yeah.

361
00:26:27,999 --> 00:26:29,226
What's that then?

362
00:26:30,466 --> 00:26:33,796
Well, it's, you know, the final day on Earth.

363
00:26:34,533 --> 00:26:37,399
When mankind will be judged for all the crimes

364
00:26:37,399 --> 00:26:40,932
they've committed and that.

365
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:44,733
And see who gets into Heaven and who gets into Hell and all that?

366
00:26:44,733 --> 00:26:45,566
Yeah.

367
00:26:45,566 --> 00:26:47,399
And what's the other place?

368
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:48,800
Purgatory.

369
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,390
Purgatory?

370
00:26:50,932 --> 00:26:54,199
Purgatory's kind of like the in-betweeny one.

371
00:26:54,199 --> 00:26:58,154
You weren't really shit, but you weren't all that great, either.

372
00:26:58,899 --> 00:27:00,490
Like Tottenham.

373
00:27:01,299 --> 00:27:03,060
Do you believe in all that stuff, Ken?

374
00:27:03,867 --> 00:27:05,466
About Tottenham?

375
00:27:05,466 --> 00:27:08,364
The Last Judgment and the afterlife.

376
00:27:10,733 --> 00:27:12,198
Guilt and 

377
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:14,093
sins and

378
00:27:15,399 --> 00:27:16,864
Hell and 

379
00:27:17,566 --> 00:27:18,793
all that?

380
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:29,824
Um...

381
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,595
KEN: I don't know, Ray. I don't know what I believe.

382
00:27:36,266 --> 00:27:39,061
The things you're taught as a child, they never really leave you, do they?

383
00:27:39,666 --> 00:27:42,032
So, like, I believe in trying to lead a good life.

384
00:27:42,032 --> 00:27:44,498
Like, if there's an old lady, carrying her shopping home,

385
00:27:45,899 --> 00:27:48,922
I don't try and help her carry her shopping, I don't go that far,

386
00:27:49,633 --> 00:27:50,766
but I'll certainly hold the

387
00:27:50,766 --> 00:27:52,399
door open for her and that,

388
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:53,899
and let her go out before me.

389
00:27:53,899 --> 00:27:56,199
Yeah. And anyway, if you tried to help her carry her shopping,

390
00:27:56,199 --> 00:27:57,832
she'd probably think you were just trying to nick her shopping.

391
00:27:57,832 --> 00:27:58,500
Exactly.

392
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,090
This is the world we live in today.

393
00:28:00,899 --> 00:28:02,566
At the same time

394
00:28:02,566 --> 00:28:05,633
as trying to lead a good life,

395
00:28:05,633 --> 00:28:09,360
I have to reconcile myself with the fact that, yes, I have killed people.

396
00:28:10,899 --> 00:28:12,366
Not many people.

397
00:28:12,366 --> 00:28:14,298
Most of them were not very nice people.

398
00:28:15,233 --> 00:28:17,299
Apart from one person.

399
00:28:17,299 --> 00:28:18,766
Who's that?

400
00:28:18,766 --> 00:28:21,132
This fellow, Danny Aliband's brother.

401
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:22,792
He was just trying to protect his brother.

402
00:28:23,366 --> 00:28:26,025
Like you or I would.He was just a lollipop man.

403
00:28:27,099 --> 00:28:29,333
He came at me with a bottle.

404
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:31,663
What are you gonna do?I shot him down.

405
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:35,399
In my book, though,

406
00:28:35,399 --> 00:28:37,999
sorry, someone comes at you with a bottle,

407
00:28:37,999 --> 00:28:40,333
that is a deadly weapon, he's gotta take the consequences.

408
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:41,899
I know that in my heart.

409
00:28:41,899 --> 00:28:44,032
I also know that he was just trying to protect his brother, you know?

410
00:28:44,032 --> 00:28:46,633
I know. But a bottle, that can kill you.

411
00:28:46,633 --> 00:28:47,866
It's a case of it's you or him.

412
00:28:47,866 --> 00:28:49,866
If he'd come at you with his bare hands, that'd be different.

413
00:28:49,866 --> 00:28:50,932
That wouldn't have been fair.

414
00:28:50,932 --> 00:28:53,066
Well, technically, your bare hands can kill somebody, too.

415
00:28:53,066 --> 00:28:54,466
They can be deadly weapons, too. 

416
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:56,166
I mean, what if he knew karate, say?

417
00:28:56,166 --> 00:28:57,600
You said he was a lollipop man.

418
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,065
He was a lollipop man.

419
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:01,666
What's a lollipop man doing knowing fucking karate?

420
00:29:01,666 --> 00:29:02,899
I'm just saying.

421
00:29:02,899 --> 00:29:04,024
How old was he? About 50.

422
00:29:04,866 --> 00:29:05,566
What's a 50-year-old

423
00:29:05,566 --> 00:29:08,132
lollipop man doing knowing fucking karate?

424
00:29:08,132 --> 00:29:10,333
What was he, a Chinese lollipop man?

425
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:12,132
Jesus, Ken,

426
00:29:12,132 --> 00:29:14,394
I'm trying to talk about...

427
00:29:21,932 --> 00:29:23,832
I know what you're trying to talk about.

428
00:29:23,832 --> 00:29:25,466
I killed a little boy.

429
00:29:25,466 --> 00:29:27,266
You keep bringing up fucking lollipop men!

430
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:29,032
You didn't mean to kill a little boy.

431
00:29:29,032 --> 00:29:31,191
I know I didn't mean to.

432
00:29:32,932 --> 00:29:34,694
But because of the choices I made and the course that 

433
00:29:35,366 --> 00:29:38,999
I put into action,a little boy isn't here anymore.

434
00:29:38,999 --> 00:29:40,726
And he'll never be here again.

435
00:29:45,832 --> 00:29:47,957
I mean here in the world, not here in Belgium.

436
00:29:50,533 --> 00:29:52,333
Well, he'll never be here in Belgium, either, will he?

437
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:54,492
I mean, he might have wanted to come here when he got older.

438
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,760
I don't know why.

439
00:29:58,932 --> 00:30:00,660
And that's all because of me.

440
00:30:02,966 --> 00:30:04,660
He's dead because of me.

441
00:30:05,233 --> 00:30:07,399
And I'm trying to...

442
00:30:07,399 --> 00:30:09,592
I'm trying to get me head around it, but I can't.

443
00:30:11,732 --> 00:30:13,631
I will always have killed that little boy.

444
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:17,796
That ain't ever going away. 

445
00:30:18,266 --> 00:30:19,596
Ever.

446
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:21,864
Unless...

447
00:30:23,099 --> 00:30:24,860
Maybe I go away.

448
00:30:29,433 --> 00:30:31,296
Don't even think like that.

449
00:31:27,066 --> 00:31:28,622
You look good.

450
00:31:33,132 --> 00:31:34,961
What's it matter anyway?

451
00:32:00,233 --> 00:32:01,866
So, what do you do, Raymond?

452
00:32:01,866 --> 00:32:03,632
I 

453
00:32:03,632 --> 00:32:05,292
shoot people for money.

454
00:32:07,665 --> 00:32:09,433
What kinds of people?

455
00:32:09,433 --> 00:32:12,832
Priests. Children. You know, the usual.

456
00:32:12,832 --> 00:32:14,866
Is there a lot of money to be made in that line of business?

457
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:16,966
There is in priests. There isn't in children.

458
00:32:16,966 --> 00:32:18,266
So what is it you do, Chloe?

459
00:32:18,266 --> 00:32:21,832
I sell cocaine and heroin to Belgian film crews.

460
00:32:21,832 --> 00:32:23,298
Do you?

461
00:32:25,632 --> 00:32:27,962
Do I look like I do?

462
00:32:28,966 --> 00:32:30,523
You do, actually.

463
00:32:33,732 --> 00:32:37,732
Do I look like I shoot people?

464
00:32:37,732 --> 00:32:39,789
No.

465
00:32:40,699 --> 00:32:42,529
Just children.

466
00:32:49,765 --> 00:32:51,565
I saw your midget today.

467
00:32:51,565 --> 00:32:53,333
Little prick didn't even say hello.

468
00:32:53,333 --> 00:32:55,166
Well, he's on a lot of ketamine.

469
00:32:55,166 --> 00:32:56,063
What's that?

470
00:32:58,266 --> 00:32:59,899
Horse tranquilizer.

471
00:32:59,899 --> 00:33:00,990
A horse tranquilizer?

472
00:33:01,399 --> 00:33:02,266
Where'd he get that?

473
00:33:02,266 --> 00:33:03,899
I sold it to him.

474
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:06,797
You can't sell horse tranquilizers to a midget!

475
00:33:10,299 --> 00:33:12,565
This movie, I think it's gonna be a very good one.

476
00:33:12,565 --> 00:33:14,966
There's never been a classic movie made in Bruges until now.

477
00:33:14,966 --> 00:33:16,765
Of course there hasn't, it's a shithole.

478
00:33:16,765 --> 00:33:18,099
Bruges is my hometown, Ray.

479
00:33:18,099 --> 00:33:19,466
Well, it's still a shithole.

480
00:33:19,466 --> 00:33:20,532
It's not a shithole.

481
00:33:20,532 --> 00:33:23,132
What? Even midgets have to take drugs to stick it.

482
00:33:23,132 --> 00:33:24,495
Okay.

483
00:33:25,899 --> 00:33:27,999
So, 

484
00:33:27,999 --> 00:33:29,521
you've insulted my hometown.

485
00:33:30,099 --> 00:33:32,699
You're doing very well, Raymond.

486
00:33:32,699 --> 00:33:35,066
Why don't you tell me some Belgian jokes while you're at it?

487
00:33:35,066 --> 00:33:36,699
I don't know any Belgian jokes.

488
00:33:36,699 --> 00:33:39,563
And if I did, I think I'd have the good sense not to...

489
00:33:40,166 --> 00:33:41,132
Hey, hang on. 

490
00:33:41,132 --> 00:33:43,825
Is Belgium where there were all those child abuse murders lately?

491
00:33:44,866 --> 00:33:46,491
Then I do know a Belgian joke.

492
00:33:49,266 --> 00:33:51,027
What's Belgium famous for?

493
00:33:52,066 --> 00:33:53,266
Chocolates and child abuse.

494
00:33:53,266 --> 00:33:56,198
And they only invented the chocolates to get to the kids.

495
00:33:58,132 --> 00:33:59,765
What?

496
00:33:59,765 --> 00:34:02,391
One of the girls they murdered was a friend of mine.

497
00:34:12,866 --> 00:34:14,332
I'm sorry, Chloe.

498
00:34:23,966 --> 00:34:26,431
One of the girls they murdered wasn't a friend of mine.

499
00:34:27,132 --> 00:34:29,098
I just wanted to make you feel bad.

500
00:34:29,999 --> 00:34:31,632
And it worked.

501
00:34:31,632 --> 00:34:33,258
Quite well.

502
00:34:51,832 --> 00:34:53,196
Fucking unbelievable.

503
00:35:07,066 --> 00:35:08,732
What's fucking unbelievable?

504
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:10,221
Are you talking to me?

505
00:35:12,266 --> 00:35:15,499
(SOFTLY) He pauses, even though he should just hit the cunt.

506
00:35:15,499 --> 00:35:16,899
And he repeats.

507
00:35:16,899 --> 00:35:19,932
Yes, I am talking to you.

508
00:35:19,932 --> 00:35:21,565
What's fucking unbelievable?

509
00:35:21,565 --> 00:35:23,532
Well, I'll tell you what's fucking unbelievable, shall I?

510
00:35:23,532 --> 00:35:26,532
Blowing cigarette smoke straight into myself and my girlfriend's face.

511
00:35:26,532 --> 00:35:27,832
That's fucking unbelievable!

512
00:35:27,832 --> 00:35:28,699
This is the smoking section.

513
00:35:28,699 --> 00:35:31,032
I don't care if it's the smoking section.

514
00:35:31,032 --> 00:35:34,233
All right? She directed it right in my face, man.

515
00:35:34,233 --> 00:35:36,499
I don't wanna die just because of your fucking arrogance. Uh-huh.

516
00:35:36,499 --> 00:35:38,931
Isn't that what the Vietnamese used to say?

517
00:35:39,532 --> 00:35:41,199
Vietnamese?

518
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:43,032
 What are you talking about, the Vietnamese?

519
00:35:43,032 --> 00:35:44,565
That statement makes no fucking sense at all.

520
00:35:44,565 --> 00:35:46,599
Yes it does. The Vietnamese!

521
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:48,699
Well, saying it over and over ain't gonna make any more sense out of it.

522
00:35:48,699 --> 00:35:54,032
How does the Vietnamese have any relevance whatsoever to myself and my girlfriend having to breathe

523
00:35:54,032 --> 00:35:56,532
your friend's cigarette smoke?

524
00:35:56,532 --> 00:35:57,896
Tell me how saying...

525
00:35:59,233 --> 00:36:01,994
That's for John Lennon, you Yankee fucking cunt!

526
00:36:02,699 --> 00:36:03,732
A bottle? 

527
00:36:03,732 --> 00:36:05,130
No, don't bother.

528
00:36:18,799 --> 00:36:20,265
We're leaving.

529
00:36:20,699 --> 00:36:22,199
I don't hit women!

530
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:24,256
I would never hit a woman, Chloe!

531
00:36:24,866 --> 00:36:27,132
I'd hit a woman who was trying to hit me with a bottle!

532
00:36:27,132 --> 00:36:29,899
That's different. That's self-defense, isn't it?

533
00:36:29,899 --> 00:36:32,398
Or a woman who could do karate.

534
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:34,432
I'd never hit a woman generally, Chloe.

535
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,999
Don't think that.

536
00:36:35,999 --> 00:36:37,692
God, you're pretty.

537
00:36:39,966 --> 00:36:41,532
I have to make a call.

538
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:42,966
Oh, no.

539
00:36:42,966 --> 00:36:46,329
You've gone off me, now, haven't you? Just because I hit that fucking cow.

540
00:37:11,999 --> 00:37:12,799
Hello?

541
00:37:12,799 --> 00:37:14,765
HARRY. ; Where the fuck were you yesterday?

542
00:37:15,632 --> 00:37:18,398
We just popped out for some dinner, Harry. We only popped out for half an hour.

543
00:37:18,398 --> 00:37:20,298
Yeah? What'd you have?

544
00:37:20,298 --> 00:37:20,799
For dinner?

545
00:37:20,799 --> 00:37:21,799
Yeah.

546
00:37:21,799 --> 00:37:23,332
Pizza, at Pizza Hut.

547
00:37:23,332 --> 00:37:24,632
Was it nice?

548
00:37:24,632 --> 00:37:26,899
Yeah, it was all right. I don't know. It was Pizza Hut.

549
00:37:26,899 --> 00:37:27,966
The same as in England.

550
00:37:27,966 --> 00:37:29,522
Well, that's globalization, isn't it? 

551
00:37:30,132 --> 00:37:31,495
Is Ray there with you?

552
00:37:32,499 --> 00:37:34,332
He's in the toilet.

553
00:37:34,332 --> 00:37:36,166
Can he hear?

554
00:37:36,166 --> 00:37:36,765
No.

555
00:37:36,765 --> 00:37:38,565
What's he doing?

556
00:37:38,565 --> 00:37:39,332
What do you mean?

557
00:37:39,332 --> 00:37:41,632
Is he doing a wee or a poo?

558
00:37:41,632 --> 00:37:43,199
I don't know, Harry, the door's closed.

559
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:44,699
Send him out on an errand for half an hour, 

560
00:37:44,699 --> 00:37:46,665
but don't make it sound suspicious.

561
00:37:52,565 --> 00:37:55,360
Ray? Why don't you go out down to the pub for half an hour?

562
00:37:58,866 --> 00:38:01,832
Yeah, yeah, I know I said you couldn't,

563
00:38:01,832 --> 00:38:03,821
but might as well enjoy ourselves, eh?

564
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:07,099
No, I don't know if they've got bowling anywhere.

565
00:38:07,099 --> 00:38:08,496
Could have a look.

566
00:38:09,899 --> 00:38:11,330
Yeah, see you.

567
00:38:22,565 --> 00:38:24,032
Yeah. He's gone.

568
00:38:24,032 --> 00:38:25,520
What'd you say to him?

569
00:38:26,198 --> 00:38:28,765
I said, " Why don't you go have a drink, you say you've been cooped up?"

570
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:29,765
What did he say?

571
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:30,966
Said, yeah, he would.

572
00:38:30,966 --> 00:38:33,132
And he might go have a look to see if there's a bowling alley around.

573
00:38:33,132 --> 00:38:35,132
Was he just having a wee?

574
00:38:35,132 --> 00:38:36,999
Yeah, I think so. I assume so.

575
00:38:36,999 --> 00:38:38,232
Sure he didn't mind?

576
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:39,699
No, he was glad to get out.

577
00:38:39,699 --> 00:38:41,066
He's definitely gone?

578
00:38:41,066 --> 00:38:42,499
Yeah, yeah, he slammed the door.

579
00:38:42,499 --> 00:38:45,125
That don't mean he's gone. Go check outside the door.

580
00:39:02,532 --> 00:39:04,398
Harry, he's definitely gone.

581
00:39:04,398 --> 00:39:06,732
You realize there are no bowling alleys in Bruges?

582
00:39:06,732 --> 00:39:09,332
I realize that, Harry. The boy wanted to have a look anyway.

583
00:39:09,332 --> 00:39:11,832
What are they gonna have, a medieval fucking bowling alley?

584
00:39:11,832 --> 00:39:14,265
As I say, I think he was just glad to get out and about.

585
00:39:14,265 --> 00:39:17,066
So, is he having a nice time, seeing all the canals and that?

586
00:39:17,066 --> 00:39:19,532
I had a lovely time when I was there.

587
00:39:19,532 --> 00:39:22,066
All the canals and the old buildings and that.

588
00:39:22,066 --> 00:39:23,198
When were you here?

589
00:39:23,198 --> 00:39:24,765
When I was seven.

590
00:39:24,765 --> 00:39:26,993
Last happy holiday I fucking had.

591
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:29,465
Have you been on a canal trip, yet?

592
00:39:29,465 --> 00:39:30,298
Yeah.

593
00:39:30,298 --> 00:39:32,499
Have you been down, like, all the old cobbled streets and that?

594
00:39:32,499 --> 00:39:33,432
Yeah.

595
00:39:33,432 --> 00:39:35,465
It's like a fairytale, isn't it, that place?

596
00:39:35,465 --> 00:39:35,899
Yeah.

597
00:39:35,899 --> 00:39:37,432
With the churches and that. They're Gothic.

598
00:39:37,432 --> 00:39:37,866
Yeah.

599
00:39:37,866 --> 00:39:38,732
Is it Gothic?

600
00:39:38,732 --> 00:39:39,499
Yeah.

601
00:39:39,499 --> 00:39:42,232
So he's having a really nice time?

602
00:39:42,232 --> 00:39:45,131
Well, I'm having a really nice time.

603
00:39:45,131 --> 00:39:48,256
I'm not sure if it's really his cup of tea.

604
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:52,432
What?

605
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:54,298
You know, I'm not sure if it's really his thing.

606
00:39:54,298 --> 00:39:55,899
What do you mean, "It's not really his thing"?

607
00:39:55,899 --> 00:39:58,131
What's that supposed to mean, "It's not really his thing"?

608
00:39:58,131 --> 00:39:59,732
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

609
00:39:59,732 --> 00:40:00,765
Nothing, Harry.

610
00:40:00,765 --> 00:40:02,899
It's a fairytale fucking town, isn't it?

611
00:40:02,899 --> 00:40:05,765
How can a fairytale town not be somebody's fucking thing?

612
00:40:05,765 --> 00:40:08,966
How can all those canals and bridges and cobbled streets and those churches,

613
00:40:08,966 --> 00:40:11,032
all that beautiful fucking fairytale stuff,

614
00:40:11,032 --> 00:40:13,332
how can that not be somebody's fucking thing, eh?

615
00:40:13,332 --> 00:40:14,599
What I think I meant to say was...

616
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:15,966
Is the swan still there? Yeah, the swan's...

617
00:40:15,966 --> 00:40:16,699
How can fucking swans not fucking 

618
00:40:16,699 --> 00:40:18,365
be somebody's fucking thing, eh?

619
00:40:18,365 --> 00:40:20,799
How can that be?

620
00:40:20,799 --> 00:40:21,966
What I think I meant to say was,

621
00:40:21,966 --> 00:40:25,232
when he first arrived, he wasn't quite sure about it.

622
00:40:25,232 --> 00:40:29,032
You know, there's that big, dual carriageway when you get off the train?

623
00:40:29,032 --> 00:40:31,632
It mightn't have been here when you were here last, Harry.

624
00:40:31,632 --> 00:40:34,732
Well, as soon as he got into, like, the old town proper,

625
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:37,332
and he saw the canals and the bridges and,

626
00:40:37,332 --> 00:40:40,699
you know, the swans and that,well, he just fucking loved it then.

627
00:40:40,699 --> 00:40:41,899
Couldn't get enough of it,

628
00:40:41,899 --> 00:40:43,922
the medieval part of town.

629
00:40:44,398 --> 00:40:45,765
It was just that initial,

630
00:40:45,765 --> 00:40:49,032
dual carriageway thing sort of put him off for a second.

631
00:40:49,032 --> 00:40:50,765
Don't know if I remember a dual carriageway.

632
00:40:50,765 --> 00:40:52,131
Must be recent.

633
00:40:52,131 --> 00:40:53,599
Hasn't spoilt it, has it?

634
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:55,565
No, no, no,

635
00:40:55,565 --> 00:40:57,963
it's just that initial thing.

636
00:40:59,265 --> 00:41:01,731
And you know what?

637
00:41:02,165 --> 00:41:04,365
As we were walking through the streets,

638
00:41:04,365 --> 00:41:06,765
there was 

639
00:41:06,765 --> 00:41:10,131
this sort of freezing fog hanging over everything,

640
00:41:10,131 --> 00:41:14,165
and it made it look almost like a fairytale or something.

641
00:41:14,165 --> 00:41:15,465
And he turned to me, do you know what he said?

642
00:41:15,465 --> 00:41:17,131
What'd he say?

643
00:41:17,131 --> 00:41:20,765
He said, " Ken, I know I'm awake, 

644
00:41:20,765 --> 00:41:22,398
but I feel like I'm in a dream."

645
00:41:22,398 --> 00:41:24,732
Yeah? He said that?

646
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:25,599
Yeah.

647
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:28,465
Meaning, like, in a good dream?

648
00:41:28,465 --> 00:41:31,265
Yeah. Of course, like in a good dream.

649
00:41:31,265 --> 00:41:33,332
Oh, good. 

650
00:41:33,332 --> 00:41:34,832
I'm glad he likes it there.

651
00:41:34,832 --> 00:41:36,832
I'm glad we were able to give him something.

652
00:41:36,832 --> 00:41:40,320
Something good and happy. Because he wasn't a bad kid, was he?

653
00:41:43,532 --> 00:41:46,396
He wasn't a bad kid, was he?

654
00:41:46,998 --> 00:41:48,699
Listen, take down this address.

655
00:41:48,699 --> 00:41:50,065
Raamstraat 17.

656
00:41:50,065 --> 00:41:52,997
That's "Raam," like "Ram," but with an extra "a."

657
00:41:54,031 --> 00:41:55,165
Raamstraat 17.

658
00:41:55,165 --> 00:41:56,688
You got that?

659
00:41:57,165 --> 00:41:58,799
Yes, Raamstraat 17.

660
00:41:58,799 --> 00:42:01,432
Good. There'll be a man there tomorrow morning at 9.;00, 

661
00:42:01,432 --> 00:42:02,966
his name's Yuri.

662
00:42:02,966 --> 00:42:03,532
Yuri.

663
00:42:03,532 --> 00:42:04,799
He'll give you the gun.

664
00:42:04,799 --> 00:42:07,866
Ring me on the public phone at Jimmy Driscoll's

665
00:42:07,866 --> 00:42:10,058
about 3.;00 or 4.;00 tomorrow, after it's done.

666
00:42:10,465 --> 00:42:12,761
After what's done?

667
00:42:12,899 --> 00:42:15,228
Are you being thick?

668
00:42:16,398 --> 00:42:17,198
No.

669
00:42:17,198 --> 00:42:19,031
Listen, I like Ray. He was a good bloke,

670
00:42:19,031 --> 00:42:22,398
but when it all comes down to it, you know,he blew the head off a little fucking kid.

671
00:42:22,398 --> 00:42:23,765
And you brought him in, Ken.

672
00:42:23,765 --> 00:42:27,458
So if the buck don't stop with him, where does it stop?

673
00:42:32,699 --> 00:42:34,631
Ken?

674
00:42:35,065 --> 00:42:37,432
If the buck don't stop with him, where does it stop?

675
00:42:37,432 --> 00:42:39,265
It stops with me, Harry. That's an easy one.

676
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:42,254
Look, don't get shirty, Ken.

677
00:42:42,499 --> 00:42:47,298
Listen, I'm just glad that I was able to do something for the boy before he went.

678
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:49,098
Do what for the boy?

679
00:42:49,098 --> 00:42:52,030
You know, have him get to see Bruges.

680
00:42:52,432 --> 00:42:55,887
I'd like to go to see Bruges again before I die.

681
00:42:56,332 --> 00:43:00,355
What was it he said again about... Yeah, "It's like a dream."

682
00:43:01,765 --> 00:43:02,398
"I know I'm awake,

683
00:43:02,398 --> 00:43:04,830
but I feel like I'm in a dream."

684
00:43:07,265 --> 00:43:09,424
Yeah.

685
00:43:10,298 --> 00:43:12,662
Give me a call when he's dead.

686
00:43:37,765 --> 00:43:40,432
That's my fucking girlfriend, you asshole.

687
00:43:40,432 --> 00:43:41,465
Eirik, what are you doing?

688
00:43:41,465 --> 00:43:43,298
Where are you from, fucker?

689
00:43:43,298 --> 00:43:45,632
Ireland, originally.

690
00:43:45,632 --> 00:43:49,866
And you think it's okay to come over to Belgium and fuck another man's girl?

691
00:43:49,866 --> 00:43:51,632
Look, I didn't know she had a boyfriend, all right?

692
00:43:51,632 --> 00:43:53,198
And I haven't fucked her, anyway. Ask her.

693
00:43:53,198 --> 00:43:54,599
I'd only put me hand on it.

694
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:56,656
Eirik, put the gun down!

695
00:43:57,799 --> 00:44:00,265
Get down on your knees and open your mouth.

696
00:44:00,265 --> 00:44:01,931
Don't start being silly.

697
00:44:01,931 --> 00:44:03,830
Get down on your...

698
00:44:04,665 --> 00:44:08,565
Exactly at what point was it that all skinheads suddenly became poofs?

699
00:44:08,565 --> 00:44:10,332
Used to be, you were a skinhead, you just went around beating up

700
00:44:10,332 --> 00:44:13,332
Pakistani 12-year-olds.

701
00:44:13,332 --> 00:44:15,423
Now it seems a prerequisite to be a fucking bum-boy!

702
00:44:16,765 --> 00:44:18,065
That's not gonna help you, man.

703
00:44:18,065 --> 00:44:20,827
Ray, there's only blanks in that gun.

704
00:44:27,332 --> 00:44:29,198
Eirik, don't!

705
00:44:29,198 --> 00:44:30,632
Now who's the fucking bum-boy?

706
00:44:30,632 --> 00:44:32,120
You, you fucking bum-boy!

707
00:44:34,931 --> 00:44:35,831
Chloe, 

708
00:44:35,831 --> 00:44:37,065
what exactly is going on here?

709
00:44:37,065 --> 00:44:38,165
I can't see!

710
00:44:38,165 --> 00:44:39,098
I can't see!

711
00:44:39,098 --> 00:44:40,165
Of course you can't fucking see!

712
00:44:40,165 --> 00:44:42,495
 I just shot a blank in your fucking eyes!

713
00:44:43,565 --> 00:44:44,565
Is this fella your boyfriend?

714
00:44:44,565 --> 00:44:46,065
No.

715
00:44:46,065 --> 00:44:47,499
 I mean,

716
00:44:47,499 --> 00:44:48,565
 he used to be.

717
00:44:48,565 --> 00:44:49,632
Well, what's he doing here?

718
00:44:49,632 --> 00:44:51,732
We... 

719
00:44:51,732 --> 00:44:53,365
We rob tourists, sometimes.

720
00:44:53,365 --> 00:44:54,632
I fucking knew it was too good to be true!

721
00:44:56,565 --> 00:44:58,398
I knew you'd have never shagged me, normally.

722
00:44:58,398 --> 00:45:00,831
No! That's not true, I...

723
00:45:00,831 --> 00:45:03,627
I called it off tonight. I told him not to come tonight.

724
00:45:04,165 --> 00:45:05,499
Why did you come tonight?

725
00:45:05,499 --> 00:45:06,965
EIRIK: Chloe, I can't see, I swear it!

726
00:45:06,965 --> 00:45:09,363
Stop whingeing like a big gay baby.

727
00:45:09,765 --> 00:45:11,432
I haven't had a shag in months!

728
00:45:11,432 --> 00:45:13,965
I can't see out of this eye, Chloe! 

729
00:45:13,965 --> 00:45:16,227
I have to go to the hospital!

730
00:45:16,599 --> 00:45:18,165
I'll drive you.

731
00:45:18,165 --> 00:45:20,065
Great! Now the whole night's ruined!

732
00:45:20,065 --> 00:45:21,298
No!

733
00:45:21,298 --> 00:45:23,093
You can stay if you want.

734
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:25,398
I just don't know how long I'll be.

735
00:45:25,398 --> 00:45:26,532
I just knew someone like you

736
00:45:26,532 --> 00:45:27,831
would never like someone like me.

737
00:45:27,831 --> 00:45:28,398
God

738
00:45:28,398 --> 00:45:29,465
I just knew.

739
00:45:29,465 --> 00:45:31,198
What do you mean, someone like me?

740
00:45:31,198 --> 00:45:33,891
You know, someone nice.

741
00:45:40,499 --> 00:45:42,298
Call me.

742
00:45:42,298 --> 00:45:44,230
 Please.

743
00:45:48,398 --> 00:45:50,227
EIRIK: Chloe!

744
00:46:29,198 --> 00:46:31,187
Cha-ching!

745
00:46:40,398 --> 00:46:42,387


746
00:46:44,865 --> 00:46:46,854


747
00:47:00,232 --> 00:47:01,764
Have you got some sort of problem?

748
00:47:01,764 --> 00:47:03,696
No, no problem.

749
00:47:03,831 --> 00:47:05,632
Four beers in 20 minutes.

750
00:47:05,632 --> 00:47:07,291
No problem.

751
00:47:08,465 --> 00:47:10,021
Fuck off.

752
00:47:17,831 --> 00:47:19,820
JIMMY: Beer and a red wine.

753
00:47:20,532 --> 00:47:21,827
I'll be back.

754
00:47:24,065 --> 00:47:26,098
How's the movie going?

755
00:47:26,098 --> 00:47:30,155
It's a jumped-up Eurotrash piece of rip-off fucking bullshit.

756
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:33,223
Like, in a bad way?

757
00:47:35,632 --> 00:47:37,365
Your girlfriend's very pretty.

758
00:47:37,365 --> 00:47:39,131
She ain't my girlfriend.

759
00:47:39,131 --> 00:47:41,529
She's a prostitute I just picked up.

760
00:47:43,398 --> 00:47:45,731
Didn't know there were any prostitutes in Bruges.

761
00:47:45,731 --> 00:47:48,131
You just have to look in the right places.

762
00:47:48,131 --> 00:47:50,222
Brothels are good.

763
00:47:51,432 --> 00:47:54,532
Well, you've picked up a very pretty prostitute.

764
00:47:54,532 --> 00:47:56,122
Thank you.

765
00:48:00,332 --> 00:48:02,560
You from the States?

766
00:48:02,965 --> 00:48:04,499
Yeah.

767
00:48:04,499 --> 00:48:05,865
But don't hold it against me.

768
00:48:05,865 --> 00:48:07,626
I'll try not to.

769
00:48:08,898 --> 00:48:12,422
Just try not to say anything too loud or crass.

770
00:48:29,664 --> 00:48:32,031
Hey-ho. Drowning your sorrows, huh?

771
00:48:32,031 --> 00:48:32,764
What sorrows?

772
00:48:32,764 --> 00:48:35,865
You know, being a sad, old, ugly little man.

773
00:48:35,865 --> 00:48:37,165
One gay beer, please.

774
00:48:37,165 --> 00:48:38,532
How'd your date go?

775
00:48:38,532 --> 00:48:40,631
My date involved two instances of extreme violence.

776
00:48:40,631 --> 00:48:42,664
One instance of her hand on my cock and my finger up her thing,

777
00:48:42,664 --> 00:48:44,596
which lasted all too briefly.

778
00:48:44,865 --> 00:48:45,731
Isn't that always the way?

779
00:48:45,731 --> 00:48:49,098
One instance of me stealing five grams of her very-high-quality cocaine,

780
00:48:49,098 --> 00:48:51,398
and one instance of me blinding a poofy little skinhead.

781
00:48:51,398 --> 00:48:54,664
So, all in all, my evening pretty much balanced out fine.

782
00:48:54,664 --> 00:48:56,789
You got five grams of coke?

783
00:48:57,898 --> 00:48:59,298
I've got four grams on me and one gram in me,

784
00:48:59,298 --> 00:49:01,998
which is why me heart is going like the clappers,as if I'm about to have a heart attack.

785
00:49:01,998 --> 00:49:03,564
So if I collapse any minute now, please remember to tell the doctors

786
00:49:03,564 --> 00:49:05,865
that it might have something to do with the coke.

787
00:49:05,865 --> 00:49:07,631
Give us a gram, then.

788
00:49:07,631 --> 00:49:09,432
I thought you were laying off, because it makes you depressed?

789
00:49:09,432 --> 00:49:12,489
You know what? Right now, I don't really give a fuck.

790
00:49:40,965 --> 00:49:44,056
Why didn't you wave hello to me today when I waved hello to you today?

791
00:49:44,198 --> 00:49:46,798
I was on a very strong horse tranquilizer today.

792
00:49:46,798 --> 00:49:49,764
I wasn't waving hello to anybody,

793
00:49:49,764 --> 00:49:52,232
except maybe to a horse.

794
00:49:52,232 --> 00:49:54,898
Huh? What are you talking about?

795
00:49:54,898 --> 00:49:57,764
Just horseshit.

796
00:49:57,764 --> 00:49:59,598
You from America?

797
00:49:59,598 --> 00:50:02,265
Yeah. But don't hold it against me.

798
00:50:02,265 --> 00:50:05,060
Well, that's for me to decide, isn't it?

799
00:50:05,298 --> 00:50:06,764
Are you from America, too?

800
00:50:06,764 --> 00:50:08,698
No, I'm from Amsterdam.

801
00:50:08,698 --> 00:50:09,798
(SCOFFS) Amsterdam.

802
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:12,631
Amsterdam is just a load of bloody prostitutes, isn't it?

803
00:50:12,631 --> 00:50:14,764
Yes. That's why I came to Bruges.

804
00:50:14,764 --> 00:50:18,219
I thought I'd get a better price for my pussy here.

805
00:50:22,498 --> 00:50:24,397
You two are weird.

806
00:50:26,165 --> 00:50:28,858
Would you like some cocaine?

807
00:50:30,965 --> 00:50:34,795
I've also got some acid and some ecstasy.

808
00:50:44,432 --> 00:50:47,031
Herve Villechaize, I know, did.

809
00:50:47,031 --> 00:50:50,758
The dwarf off, I think, The Time Bandits, did.

810
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:53,097
Lots of midgets...

811
00:50:53,464 --> 00:50:54,798
Dwarves, 

812
00:50:54,798 --> 00:50:56,424
top themselves.

813
00:50:56,898 --> 00:50:58,887
Hmm. Shitloads.

814
00:51:00,865 --> 00:51:03,161
Would you ever think about it?

815
00:51:03,965 --> 00:51:07,398
Would you ever think about killing yourself because you're a midget?

816
00:51:07,398 --> 00:51:10,564
Fuck, man! What kind of question is that?

817
00:51:10,564 --> 00:51:12,757
We're just chatting, aren't we?

818
00:51:18,831 --> 00:51:19,798
See, Ken, 

819
00:51:19,798 --> 00:51:21,965
this is the kind of hotel Harry should have put us in.

820
00:51:21,965 --> 00:51:24,692
A five-star, with prostitutes in.

821
00:51:25,065 --> 00:51:29,157
You know, sometimes, I think Harry doesn't even give a shit about us at all.

822
00:51:31,498 --> 00:51:33,828
Has he still not called?

823
00:51:34,831 --> 00:51:36,598
No. Still hasn't called.

824
00:51:36,598 --> 00:51:38,928
No news is good news, eh?

825
00:51:50,031 --> 00:51:51,929
Who's she?

826
00:51:53,031 --> 00:51:55,190
JIMMY: There's gonna be a war, man.

827
00:51:55,965 --> 00:51:57,464
I can see it.

828
00:51:57,464 --> 00:52:01,397
There's gonna be a war between the blacks and between the whites.

829
00:52:01,397 --> 00:52:03,931
You ain't even gonna need a uniform no more.

830
00:52:03,931 --> 00:52:06,731
This ain't gonna be a war where you pick your side.

831
00:52:06,731 --> 00:52:08,232
Your side's already picked for you.

832
00:52:08,232 --> 00:52:10,298
And I know whose side I'm fighting on.

833
00:52:10,298 --> 00:52:11,731
I'm fighting with the blacks.

834
00:52:11,731 --> 00:52:12,998
The whites are gonna get their heads kicked in!

835
00:52:12,998 --> 00:52:15,298
JIMMY: You don't decide this shit, man.

836
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:17,165
Well, who are the half-castes gonna fight with?

837
00:52:17,165 --> 00:52:19,965
The blacks, man. That's obvious.

838
00:52:19,965 --> 00:52:23,227
But what about the Pakistanis?

839
00:52:23,531 --> 00:52:24,898
The blacks.

840
00:52:24,898 --> 00:52:27,232
What about...

841
00:52:27,232 --> 00:52:29,561
Think of a hard one.

842
00:52:29,631 --> 00:52:31,731
What about the Vietnamese?

843
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:33,598
The blacks!

844
00:52:33,598 --> 00:52:37,156
Well, I'm definitely fighting with the blacks if they've got the Vietnamese.

845
00:52:41,998 --> 00:52:43,930
So, hang on.

846
00:52:44,431 --> 00:52:47,631
Would all of the white midgets in the world be fighting against all the black midgets in the world?

847
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:49,325
Yeah.

848
00:52:50,031 --> 00:52:52,394
That would make a good film!

849
00:52:53,065 --> 00:52:55,831
You don't know how much shit

850
00:52:55,831 --> 00:52:58,498
I've had to take off of black midgets, man.

851
00:52:58,498 --> 00:53:01,331
That's...

852
00:53:01,331 --> 00:53:02,998
Undeniably true.

853
00:53:02,998 --> 00:53:06,031
See, Jimmy,

854
00:53:06,031 --> 00:53:08,588
my wife was black.

855
00:53:09,232 --> 00:53:11,561
And I loved her very much.

856
00:53:12,464 --> 00:53:14,931
And in 1976,

857
00:53:14,931 --> 00:53:16,931
she was murdered by a white man.

858
00:53:16,931 --> 00:53:19,131
So,

859
00:53:19,131 --> 00:53:24,120
 where the fuck am I supposed to stand in all this blood and carnage?

860
00:53:24,798 --> 00:53:27,491
Did they get the guy who did it?

861
00:53:27,664 --> 00:53:28,931
A friend of mine got him.

862
00:53:28,931 --> 00:53:31,419
Harry Waters got him.

863
00:53:32,397 --> 00:53:34,331
So tell me, Jim,

864
00:53:34,331 --> 00:53:38,525
whose side do I fight on in this wonderful war?

865
00:53:40,531 --> 00:53:44,564
I think you need to weigh up all your options

866
00:53:44,564 --> 00:53:47,553
and let your conscience decide, Ken.

867
00:53:56,297 --> 00:53:58,631
Two manky hookers

868
00:53:58,631 --> 00:54:00,898
and a racist dwarf.

869
00:54:00,898 --> 00:54:02,165
I think I'm heading home.

870
00:54:02,165 --> 00:54:04,630
Yeah. I think I'll come with you.

871
00:54:06,431 --> 00:54:07,664
What's...

872
00:54:07,664 --> 00:54:09,357
Back off, shorty!

873
00:54:09,464 --> 00:54:11,124
You don't know karate.

874
00:54:11,698 --> 00:54:12,031
Don't say you didn't have it coming.

875
00:54:12,031 --> 00:54:13,331
Don't say you didn't have it coming.

876
00:54:13,331 --> 00:54:14,764
How painful

877
00:54:14,764 --> 00:54:16,593
Shortarse!

878
00:55:43,031 --> 00:55:44,131
Meeting Yuri.

879
00:55:44,131 --> 00:55:45,892
Yes, I'm Yuri.

880
00:56:14,798 --> 00:56:18,195
Mr. Waters said that might be necessary.

881
00:56:20,898 --> 00:56:24,694
There are a lot of alcoves in the Koningin Astrid Park.

882
00:56:25,197 --> 00:56:27,993
You use this word, "alcoves"?

883
00:56:28,231 --> 00:56:30,431
"Alcoves"? Yes. Sometimes.

884
00:56:30,431 --> 00:56:34,830
There are not many people around in these alcoves in Christmastime.

885
00:56:35,164 --> 00:56:37,297
If I were to murder a man,

886
00:56:37,297 --> 00:56:39,820
I would murder him here.

887
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:44,264
Are you sure this is the right word, "alcoves"?

888
00:56:44,264 --> 00:56:46,423
"Alcoves," yes.

889
00:56:46,631 --> 00:56:48,065
It's kind of like "nooks and crannies."

890
00:56:48,065 --> 00:56:50,731
"Nooks and crannies," yes.

891
00:56:50,731 --> 00:56:52,231
Perhaps this would be more accurate.

892
00:56:52,231 --> 00:56:54,965
"Nooks and crannies," rather than "alcoves."

893
00:56:54,965 --> 00:56:56,828
 Yeah.

894
00:57:01,965 --> 00:57:04,331
You are going to do it, aren't you?

895
00:57:04,331 --> 00:57:06,431
 Mr. Waters will be very disappointed...

896
00:57:06,431 --> 00:57:08,920
Of course I'm going to fucking do it.

897
00:57:10,431 --> 00:57:12,954
It's what I do.

898
00:57:18,331 --> 00:57:22,025
Your friend was behaving rather oddly this morning.

899
00:57:29,064 --> 00:57:30,798
Oddly? How?

900
00:57:30,798 --> 00:57:33,097
Well, he asked me about the baby,

901
00:57:33,097 --> 00:57:35,731
 and if I wanted a boy or a girl.

902
00:57:35,731 --> 00:57:38,998
I said I didn't mind as long as it's healthy, of course.

903
00:57:38,998 --> 00:57:40,364
But then 

904
00:57:40,364 --> 00:57:44,898
he gave me 200 euros to give to the baby.

905
00:57:44,898 --> 00:57:48,831
I refused, obviously,

906
00:57:48,831 --> 00:57:51,422
but he was quite insistent.

907
00:57:51,931 --> 00:57:55,531
Would you give it back to him when you see him?

908
00:57:55,531 --> 00:57:57,197
I don't want to appear ungrateful, 

909
00:57:57,197 --> 00:57:59,564
but it seemed like all the money he had.

910
00:57:59,564 --> 00:58:00,598
Do you know where he is now?

911
00:58:00,598 --> 00:58:03,223
He said he was going to the park.

912
00:59:02,997 --> 00:59:04,963
Sorry, Ray.

913
00:59:06,464 --> 00:59:07,930
I'm sorry.

914
00:59:38,564 --> 00:59:39,698
Ray, don't!

915
00:59:39,698 --> 00:59:40,898
Fucking hell!

916
00:59:40,898 --> 00:59:42,331
Where the fuck did you come from?

917
00:59:42,331 --> 00:59:45,364
I was behind the thing. What the fuck are you doing, Ray?

918
00:59:45,364 --> 00:59:47,097
What the fuck are you doing?

919
00:59:47,097 --> 00:59:48,529
Nothing. (BREATHING HEAVILY)

920
00:59:50,364 --> 00:59:52,159
Oh, my God!

921
00:59:53,764 --> 00:59:55,331
You were gonna kill me.

922
00:59:55,331 --> 00:59:56,798
No, I wasn't.

923
00:59:56,798 --> 00:59:58,897
You were gonna kill yourself!

924
00:59:58,897 --> 01:00:01,631
I

925
01:00:01,631 --> 01:00:03,164
I'm allowed to.

926
01:00:03,164 --> 01:00:04,264
No, you're not!

927
01:00:04,264 --> 01:00:05,897
What?

928
01:00:05,897 --> 01:00:07,731
I'm not allowed to and you are?

929
01:00:07,731 --> 01:00:09,697
How's that fair?

930
01:00:15,930 --> 01:00:19,055
Can we go somewhere and talk about this, please?

931
01:00:22,431 --> 01:00:24,598
I wasn't gonna go through with it, Ray.

932
01:00:24,598 --> 01:00:28,052
You fucking looked like you were gonna go fucking through with it.

933
01:00:30,764 --> 01:00:32,498
Where'd you get that gun?

934
01:00:32,498 --> 01:00:33,964
A friend of Harry's.

935
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:36,055
Fuck, man.

936
01:00:38,130 --> 01:00:40,153
Let me see it.

937
01:00:43,598 --> 01:00:46,063
Silencer, too.

938
01:00:47,631 --> 01:00:49,426
Nice.

939
01:00:54,297 --> 01:00:57,888
Mine's a bloody girl's gun.

940
01:01:05,798 --> 01:01:07,397
I'm keeping it.

941
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:09,556
Pardon me?

942
01:01:10,531 --> 01:01:11,197
Give me me gun back.

943
01:01:11,197 --> 01:01:13,064
You're not getting it back.

944
01:01:13,064 --> 01:01:14,064
You're a suicide case.

945
01:01:14,064 --> 01:01:16,897
And you were trying to shoot me in the fucking head.

946
01:01:16,897 --> 01:01:18,598
You're not getting that gun back.

947
01:01:18,598 --> 01:01:21,331
A great day this has turned out to be.

948
01:01:21,331 --> 01:01:23,064
I'm suicidal,

949
01:01:23,064 --> 01:01:24,830
me mate tries to kill me,

950
01:01:24,830 --> 01:01:26,364
me gun gets nicked

951
01:01:26,364 --> 01:01:29,364
and we're still in fucking Bruges.

952
01:01:29,364 --> 01:01:31,064
Listen, 

953
01:01:31,064 --> 01:01:33,997
I'm gonna give you some money and put you on a train somewhere.

954
01:01:33,997 --> 01:01:35,431
Back to England?

955
01:01:35,431 --> 01:01:37,798
You can't go back to England, Ray. You'd be a dead man!

956
01:01:37,798 --> 01:01:40,364
(CRYING) I want to be a dead man.

957
01:01:40,364 --> 01:01:43,228
Have you been missing something?

958
01:01:43,864 --> 01:01:45,364
You don't want to be a dead man, Ray.

959
01:01:45,364 --> 01:01:47,330
Ken

960
01:01:48,997 --> 01:01:51,691
I killed a little boy!

961
01:02:04,797 --> 01:02:07,764
Then save the next little boy.

962
01:02:08,531 --> 01:02:11,297
Just go away somewhere,

963
01:02:11,297 --> 01:02:15,127
get out of this business and try to do something good.

964
01:02:15,830 --> 01:02:18,897
You're not gonna help anybody dead.

965
01:02:18,897 --> 01:02:21,489
You're not gonna bring that boy back.

966
01:02:23,763 --> 01:02:26,662
But you might save the next one.

967
01:02:27,664 --> 01:02:30,331
What am I gonna be, a doctor?

968
01:02:30,331 --> 01:02:32,231
You need exams.

969
01:02:32,231 --> 01:02:34,397
Do anything, Ray.

970
01:02:34,397 --> 01:02:36,659
Do anything.

971
01:02:39,631 --> 01:02:40,364


972
01:02:40,364 --> 01:02:41,631


973
01:02:41,631 --> 01:02:42,358


974
01:02:51,897 --> 01:02:53,659
RAY: What a wanker!

975
01:02:55,431 --> 01:02:59,364
He said this whole trip,

976
01:02:59,364 --> 01:03:02,125
this whole being in Bruges thing,

977
01:03:02,598 --> 01:03:07,030
was just to give you one last, joyful memory before you died.

978
01:03:07,864 --> 01:03:10,422
In Bruges?

979
01:03:14,964 --> 01:03:17,624
The Bahamas, maybe.

980
01:03:18,664 --> 01:03:21,264
Why fucking Bruges?

981
01:03:21,264 --> 01:03:23,821
I suppose it's cheaper.

982
01:03:29,763 --> 01:03:32,594
The rest of the acid and the ecstasy.

983
01:03:33,464 --> 01:03:36,123
Can I have me gun back, please?

984
01:03:40,598 --> 01:03:43,257
What am I gonna do, Ken?

985
01:03:43,631 --> 01:03:45,564
What am I gonna do?

986
01:03:45,564 --> 01:03:47,564
Just keep moving.

987
01:03:47,564 --> 01:03:49,464
Keep on moving.

988
01:03:49,464 --> 01:03:52,123
Try not to think about it.

989
01:03:52,763 --> 01:03:54,364
Learn a new language, maybe?

990
01:03:54,364 --> 01:03:56,464
Sure, I can hardly do English.

991
01:03:56,464 --> 01:03:57,598
That's one thing I like about Europe, though.

992
01:03:57,598 --> 01:03:59,830
You don't have to learn any of their languages.

993
01:03:59,830 --> 01:04:02,598
Just forget about home for a while.

994
01:04:02,598 --> 01:04:06,130
See how the land lies in six years, seven years.

995
01:04:06,130 --> 01:04:09,064
Seven years is not that long.

996
01:04:09,064 --> 01:04:11,331
It's longer than that boy got.

997
01:04:11,331 --> 01:04:14,763
Me first fucking job.

998
01:04:14,964 --> 01:04:17,862
Great hitman I turned out to be.

999
01:04:21,097 --> 01:04:24,688
Some people just aren't cut out for it, Ray.

1000
01:04:24,897 --> 01:04:27,363
Are you?

1001
01:04:32,297 --> 01:04:35,598
When are you going back to England?

1002
01:04:35,598 --> 01:04:37,663
I'll head back in a couple of hours or something.

1003
01:04:37,663 --> 01:04:39,997
Harry's not gonna be mad at you, is he?

1004
01:04:39,997 --> 01:04:41,963
For letting me go?

1005
01:04:42,164 --> 01:04:43,130
I'll sort out Harry.

1006
01:04:43,130 --> 01:04:46,331
Just tell him I'll have probably killed meself in a fortnight, anyway.

1007
01:04:46,331 --> 01:04:48,524
You won't, will you, Ray?

1008
01:05:07,730 --> 01:05:10,297
Harry? It's Ken.

1009
01:05:10,297 --> 01:05:12,456
Listen to this noise.

1010
01:05:14,130 --> 01:05:16,431
Do you know what that is?

1011
01:05:16,431 --> 01:05:17,964
Yeah, I know you know it's a train.

1012
01:05:17,964 --> 01:05:20,123
Do you know what train?

1013
01:05:20,397 --> 01:05:22,663
Well, it's a train that Ray just got on, 

1014
01:05:22,663 --> 01:05:23,930
and he's alive and he's well,

1015
01:05:23,930 --> 01:05:26,364
and he doesn't know where he's going and neither do I.

1016
01:05:26,364 --> 01:05:29,364
So if you need to do your worst, do your worst.

1017
01:05:29,364 --> 01:05:32,563
You've got the address of the hotel. I'll be here waiting.

1018
01:05:32,563 --> 01:05:35,763
Because I've got to quite like Bruges, now.

1019
01:05:35,763 --> 01:05:37,922
It's like a fucking fairytale or something.

1020
01:06:07,364 --> 01:06:08,795
Harry.

1021
01:06:09,331 --> 01:06:10,997
Harry!

1022
01:06:10,997 --> 01:06:12,264
What?

1023
01:06:12,264 --> 01:06:14,331
It's an inanimate fucking object.

1024
01:06:14,331 --> 01:06:17,092
You're an inanimate fucking object!

1025
01:06:26,997 --> 01:06:29,830
Now, you lot be good for your mummy and lmamoto, okay?

1026
01:06:29,830 --> 01:06:31,897
'Cause Daddy's got to go away for a few days.

1027
01:06:31,897 --> 01:06:32,964
Where are you going?

1028
01:06:32,964 --> 01:06:34,597
I've got to go to Bruges.

1029
01:06:34,597 --> 01:06:36,331
Bruges? Where's that?

1030
01:06:36,331 --> 01:06:38,229
It's in Belgium.

1031
01:06:38,697 --> 01:06:41,264
Why would anybody have to go to Belgium?

1032
01:06:41,264 --> 01:06:43,457
'Cause I've got to sort something out.

1033
01:06:44,064 --> 01:06:46,530
Is it something to do with the phone?

1034
01:06:46,530 --> 01:06:48,928
It's something to do with Ken.

1035
01:06:49,964 --> 01:06:52,828
It's a matter of honor.

1036
01:06:52,997 --> 01:06:55,827
Well, it ain't gonna be dangerous, is it?

1037
01:06:58,697 --> 01:07:01,964
Well, of course it's gonna be dangerous if it's a matter of fucking honor!

1038
01:07:01,964 --> 01:07:03,563
You are bringing the fellas with you?

1039
01:07:03,563 --> 01:07:06,325
Tell me you're bringing the fellas with you.

1040
01:07:07,097 --> 01:07:08,864
Harry.

1041
01:07:08,864 --> 01:07:11,730
I'm sorry for calling you an inanimate object.

1042
01:07:11,730 --> 01:07:13,889
I was upset.

1043
01:08:52,897 --> 01:08:54,630
You're Irish?

1044
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:56,358
Yes.

1045
01:08:56,864 --> 01:08:59,489
What is your name?

1046
01:09:00,663 --> 01:09:03,857
Derek Perlurrl.

1047
01:09:06,630 --> 01:09:08,459
You hit the Canadian.

1048
01:09:09,264 --> 01:09:10,964
You hit the Canadian.

1049
01:09:10,964 --> 01:09:13,864
L"heet" the Canadian?

1050
01:09:13,864 --> 01:09:15,887
I don't know what you're talking about.

1051
01:09:17,630 --> 01:09:18,730
That's him!

1052
01:09:18,730 --> 01:09:21,094
That's the motherfucker.

1053
01:09:26,497 --> 01:09:28,929
You hit the Canadian, yeah?

1054
01:09:29,563 --> 01:09:31,264
Canadian? 

1055
01:09:31,264 --> 01:09:32,923
Shit.

1056
01:09:38,297 --> 01:09:40,330
We're taking you back to Bruges.

1057
01:09:40,330 --> 01:09:41,819
Brilliant.

1058
01:10:08,797 --> 01:10:10,820
Aye aye.

1059
01:10:11,064 --> 01:10:14,053
YURl: Take your pick, Mr. Waters.

1060
01:10:16,897 --> 01:10:18,663
(CHUCKLES) An Uzi?

1061
01:10:18,663 --> 01:10:21,463
I'm not from South Central Los fucking Angeles.

1062
01:10:21,463 --> 01:10:25,231
I didn't come here to shoot 20 black 10-year-olds in a fucking drive-by.

1063
01:10:25,231 --> 01:10:28,129
I want a normal gun for a normal person.

1064
01:10:39,530 --> 01:10:42,030
I knew he wouldn't kill the guy.

1065
01:10:42,030 --> 01:10:43,797
I could see it in his eyes

1066
01:10:43,797 --> 01:10:47,025
when I was telling him about the alcoves.

1067
01:10:47,296 --> 01:10:48,263
About the what? The alcoves.

1068
01:10:48,263 --> 01:10:49,064
The alcoves 

1069
01:10:49,064 --> 01:10:52,552
in the Koningin Astrid Park.

1070
01:10:54,363 --> 01:10:56,930
Oh, I also have some dumdums.

1071
01:10:56,930 --> 01:10:58,597
You use this word, "dumdums"? 

1072
01:10:58,597 --> 01:11:00,296
The bullets that make the head explode?

1073
01:11:00,296 --> 01:11:01,663
Dumdums, yeah.

1074
01:11:01,663 --> 01:11:04,595
Would you like some of these dumdums?

1075
01:11:04,830 --> 01:11:07,557
I know I shouldn't,

1076
01:11:08,164 --> 01:11:10,187
but I will.

1077
01:11:14,530 --> 01:11:16,519
Motherfucker.

1078
01:11:17,296 --> 01:11:18,396
Is he talking to me?

1079
01:11:18,396 --> 01:11:19,797
No, Eirik's on your side, Mr. Waters.

1080
01:11:19,797 --> 01:11:22,730
Your young friend blinded him last night.

1081
01:11:22,730 --> 01:11:23,697
Ray did?

1082
01:11:23,697 --> 01:11:25,997
I was trying to rob him

1083
01:11:25,997 --> 01:11:28,430
and he took my gun from me.

1084
01:11:28,430 --> 01:11:30,897
And the gun was full of blanks,

1085
01:11:30,897 --> 01:11:33,563
and he shot the blank into my eye.

1086
01:11:33,563 --> 01:11:35,030
And now, 

1087
01:11:35,030 --> 01:11:37,263
I cannot see from this eye ever again,

1088
01:11:37,263 --> 01:11:38,864
the doctors say.

1089
01:11:38,864 --> 01:11:42,421
Well, to be honest, it sounds like it was all your fault.

1090
01:11:42,964 --> 01:11:43,396
What?

1091
01:11:43,396 --> 01:11:46,263
I mean, basically, if you're robbing a man and you're only carrying blanks,

1092
01:11:46,263 --> 01:11:48,196
and you allow your gun to be taken off you,

1093
01:11:48,196 --> 01:11:51,997
and you allow yourself to be shot in the eye with a blank,

1094
01:11:51,997 --> 01:11:54,130
for which I assume the person has to get quite close to you, then,

1095
01:11:54,130 --> 01:11:57,463
yeah, really, it's all your fault for being such a poof.

1096
01:11:57,463 --> 01:12:00,463
So why don't you stop whingeing and cheer the fuck up?

1097
01:12:00,463 --> 01:12:04,361
YURl: Eirik, I really wouldn't respond.

1098
01:12:10,164 --> 01:12:11,430
I thought you wanted the guy dead?

1099
01:12:11,430 --> 01:12:13,663
I do want the guy dead. I want him fucking crucified.

1100
01:12:13,663 --> 01:12:15,196
But it don't change the fact that 

1101
01:12:15,196 --> 01:12:18,095
he stitched you up like a blind, little gay boy.Does it?

1102
01:12:19,930 --> 01:12:22,293
Thanks for the gun, Yuri.

1103
01:13:28,864 --> 01:13:30,693
Well?

1104
01:13:32,163 --> 01:13:34,430
The boy is suicidal, Harry.

1105
01:13:34,430 --> 01:13:36,964
He's a walking dead man.

1106
01:13:36,964 --> 01:13:39,030
Keeps going on about Hell and purgatory...

1107
01:13:39,030 --> 01:13:41,430
When I phoned you yesterday, did I ask you,

1108
01:13:41,430 --> 01:13:44,964
"Ken, will you do me a favor and become Ray's psychiatrist, please?"

1109
01:13:44,964 --> 01:13:49,697
No. What I think I asked you was, " Could you go blow his fucking head off for me?"

1110
01:13:49,697 --> 01:13:51,730
"He's suicidal"?

1111
01:13:51,730 --> 01:13:53,930
I'm suicidal. You're suicidal.

1112
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:55,430
Everybody's fucking suicidal!

1113
01:13:55,430 --> 01:13:57,597
We don't all keep going on about it!

1114
01:13:57,597 --> 01:13:59,430
Has he killed himself yet?

1115
01:13:59,430 --> 01:14:02,063
No. So he's not fucking suicidal, is he?

1116
01:14:02,063 --> 01:14:04,597
He put a loaded gun to his head this morning. I stopped him.

1117
01:14:04,597 --> 01:14:07,757
He... What? This gets fucking worse!

1118
01:14:08,096 --> 01:14:09,163
We were down in the park...

1119
01:14:09,163 --> 01:14:11,152
Let me get this right.

1120
01:14:11,296 --> 01:14:13,129
You were down in the park?

1121
01:14:13,129 --> 01:14:15,330
What's that got to do with fucking anything?

1122
01:14:15,330 --> 01:14:18,230
Let me get this right. Not only have you refused to kill the boy,

1123
01:14:18,230 --> 01:14:20,497
you've even stopped the boy from killing himself,

1124
01:14:20,497 --> 01:14:21,964
which would have solved my problem,

1125
01:14:21,964 --> 01:14:23,363
which would have solved your problem,

1126
01:14:23,363 --> 01:14:25,196
which sounds like it would've solved the boy's problem.

1127
01:14:25,196 --> 01:14:26,763
It wouldn't have solved his problem.

1128
01:14:26,763 --> 01:14:28,196
Ken, 

1129
01:14:28,196 --> 01:14:29,797
if I had killed a little kid,

1130
01:14:29,797 --> 01:14:30,930
accidentally or otherwise,

1131
01:14:30,930 --> 01:14:32,196
I wouldn't have thought twice.

1132
01:14:32,196 --> 01:14:34,129
I'd have killed myself on the fucking spot. On the fucking spot.

1133
01:14:34,129 --> 01:14:35,296
I'd have stuck the gun 

1134
01:14:35,296 --> 01:14:37,430
in me mouth on the fucking spot!

1135
01:14:37,430 --> 01:14:39,430
That's you, Harry.

1136
01:14:39,430 --> 01:14:41,296
The boy has the capacity to change.

1137
01:14:41,296 --> 01:14:43,730
The boy has the capacity to do something decent with his life.

1138
01:14:43,730 --> 01:14:45,563
Excuse me, Ken.

1139
01:14:45,563 --> 01:14:48,029
I have the capacity to change.

1140
01:14:48,029 --> 01:14:49,797
Yeah, 

1141
01:14:49,797 --> 01:14:52,096
you do. You've the capacity to get fucking worse!

1142
01:14:52,096 --> 01:14:54,763
Yeah, now I'm getting down to it!

1143
01:14:54,763 --> 01:14:56,697
Harry, let's face it.

1144
01:14:56,697 --> 01:14:59,330
And I'm not being funny, I mean no disrespect,

1145
01:14:59,330 --> 01:15:00,996
but you're a cunt.

1146
01:15:00,996 --> 01:15:03,830
You're a cunt now, you've always been a cunt.

1147
01:15:03,830 --> 01:15:07,563
And the only thing that's gonna change is you're gonna become an even bigger cunt.

1148
01:15:07,563 --> 01:15:09,196
Maybe have some more cunt kids.

1149
01:15:09,196 --> 01:15:11,296
Leave my kids fucking out of it. What have they done?

1150
01:15:11,296 --> 01:15:13,897
You fucking retract that bit about my cunt fucking kids!

1151
01:15:13,897 --> 01:15:16,196
I retract that bit about your cunt fucking kids.

1152
01:15:16,196 --> 01:15:18,463
Insulting my fucking kids!

1153
01:15:18,463 --> 01:15:19,964
That's going overboard, mate!

1154
01:15:19,964 --> 01:15:22,429
I retracted it, didn't I?

1155
01:15:25,230 --> 01:15:26,363
Still leaves you being a cunt.

1156
01:15:26,363 --> 01:15:28,795
Yeah, I fucking got that.

1157
01:15:47,396 --> 01:15:49,828
Where's Ray now?

1158
01:15:50,330 --> 01:15:52,864
Oh, right about now, Ray is in one or other

1159
01:15:52,864 --> 01:15:57,530
of the one million towns in mainland Europe it's possible to be in, 

1160
01:15:57,530 --> 01:15:58,995
other than here.

1161
01:16:12,563 --> 01:16:14,797
I'll get all the money back to you soon as I get through to me friend.

1162
01:16:14,797 --> 01:16:16,630
It's not a problem, Raymond.

1163
01:16:16,630 --> 01:16:19,430
And I'll get all your acid and your ecstasy back to you, too.

1164
01:16:19,430 --> 01:16:20,929
English humor!

1165
01:16:20,929 --> 01:16:23,725
I'm assuming you've got your gun on you.

1166
01:16:26,530 --> 01:16:29,029
That Yuri bloke's a funny fella, isn't he?

1167
01:16:29,029 --> 01:16:31,291
He does yoga.

1168
01:16:31,530 --> 01:16:32,897
"The alcoves."

1169
01:16:32,897 --> 01:16:35,727
Was he going on to you about the alcoves?

1170
01:16:36,497 --> 01:16:39,691
"The alcoves in the Koningin Astrid Park."

1171
01:16:47,797 --> 01:16:50,990
Harry, I know you gotta do what you gotta do.

1172
01:16:51,530 --> 01:16:53,296
It's a bit crowded round here, you know?

1173
01:16:53,296 --> 01:16:57,854
Well, I'm not gonna have a shootout in the middle of a thousand fucking Belgians, am I?

1174
01:16:59,263 --> 01:17:03,059
Not to mention the other nationalities, just on their holidays.

1175
01:17:04,563 --> 01:17:07,497
To see the swans and the Gothic and all the fairytale stuff, eh?

1176
01:17:07,497 --> 01:17:10,196
Are you trying to fucking wind me up?

1177
01:17:10,196 --> 01:17:11,029
No, Harry.

1178
01:17:11,029 --> 01:17:13,396
On top of calling me a cunt and calling me kids cunts.

1179
01:17:13,396 --> 01:17:16,363
I might just have to fucking shoot you right here.

1180
01:17:16,363 --> 01:17:18,420
Christ!

1181
01:17:20,996 --> 01:17:23,087
Let's go up the bell tower.

1182
01:17:24,129 --> 01:17:26,430
Be quiet up there this time of evening.

1183
01:17:26,430 --> 01:17:28,225
Let's go up there.

1184
01:17:46,797 --> 01:17:49,990
Yeah. Canadians.

1185
01:17:50,396 --> 01:17:51,763
I feel a bit bad.

1186
01:17:51,763 --> 01:17:53,630
They didn't kill John Lennon, did they?

1187
01:17:53,630 --> 01:17:56,063
Anyway, supposed to turn up to court here in two days.

1188
01:17:56,063 --> 01:17:57,363
Are you going to turn up?

1189
01:17:57,363 --> 01:18:00,454
Don't know. What have I got to stay for really?

1190
01:18:02,896 --> 01:18:06,351
The most beautiful woman

1191
01:18:07,129 --> 01:18:09,996
you've ever seen

1192
01:18:09,996 --> 01:18:13,053
in all of your stupid life.

1193
01:18:22,863 --> 01:18:24,829
The tower is closed this evening.

1194
01:18:24,829 --> 01:18:27,096
No way. It's supposed to be open till 7:00.

1195
01:18:27,096 --> 01:18:29,296
The tower is usually open until 7:00.

1196
01:18:29,296 --> 01:18:31,996
Yesterday an American had a heart attack up the tower.

1197
01:18:31,996 --> 01:18:33,863
Today the tower is closed.

1198
01:18:33,863 --> 01:18:35,163
Here, cranky, here's 100 for you. 

1199
01:18:35,163 --> 01:18:37,356
We're only gonna be 20 minutes.

1200
01:18:42,763 --> 01:18:45,663
The tower is closed

1201
01:18:45,663 --> 01:18:48,896
this evening.

1202
01:18:48,896 --> 01:18:51,953
Understand, Englishman?

1203
01:19:30,463 --> 01:19:31,929
Jimmy, I've been wanting to say

1204
01:19:31,929 --> 01:19:35,827
I'm really sorry for karate-chopping you the other night.

1205
01:19:35,963 --> 01:19:38,088
That was way out of order.

1206
01:19:38,363 --> 01:19:39,896
You know, Ray, 

1207
01:19:39,896 --> 01:19:41,063
I'd find it easier to believe 

1208
01:19:41,063 --> 01:19:44,729
and forgive you, somehow,

1209
01:19:44,729 --> 01:19:48,923
if the two of you weren't laughing straight in my fucking face!

1210
01:19:50,896 --> 01:19:53,260
It's for the goddamn movie, man.

1211
01:19:56,863 --> 01:19:59,523
It is a nice town, Harry.

1212
01:20:00,530 --> 01:20:03,018
I'm glad I got to see it.

1213
01:20:06,729 --> 01:20:08,063
I didn't mean to be taking the piss out of it

1214
01:20:08,063 --> 01:20:10,495
being a fairytale place.

1215
01:20:10,896 --> 01:20:13,530
It is a fairytale place.

1216
01:20:13,530 --> 01:20:15,396
It really is. Hmm.

1217
01:20:15,396 --> 01:20:17,096
It's just a shame it's in Belgium, really.

1218
01:20:17,096 --> 01:20:19,063
But then you figure if it wasn't in Belgium,

1219
01:20:19,063 --> 01:20:20,597
if it was somewhere good,

1220
01:20:20,597 --> 01:20:22,363
there'd be too many people coming to see it. 

1221
01:20:22,363 --> 01:20:24,794
It would spoil the whole thing.

1222
01:20:27,263 --> 01:20:29,956
Well, I'm glad I got to see it

1223
01:20:31,330 --> 01:20:33,626
before I died.

1224
01:20:39,963 --> 01:20:42,054
What are you doing?

1225
01:20:42,196 --> 01:20:44,129
What are you fucking doing?

1226
01:20:44,129 --> 01:20:46,527
I'm not fighting anymore, Harry.

1227
01:20:46,929 --> 01:20:49,861
All right, then I'm blowing your fucking head off.

1228
01:20:51,963 --> 01:20:53,597
Don't come over all Gandhi.

1229
01:20:53,597 --> 01:20:55,824
What are you fucking doing?

1230
01:20:57,463 --> 01:21:00,029
Ken, stop messing about, please.

1231
01:21:00,029 --> 01:21:02,096
Pick up your gun. I know I'm going to beat you anyway

1232
01:21:02,096 --> 01:21:05,530
'Cause you're a spaz, but... Harry,

1233
01:21:05,530 --> 01:21:08,155
I'm totally in your debt.

1234
01:21:10,497 --> 01:21:13,486
The things that have gone between us in the past,

1235
01:21:14,263 --> 01:21:16,129
I love you unreservedly for all that.

1236
01:21:16,129 --> 01:21:17,992
What?

1237
01:21:18,263 --> 01:21:20,660
For your integrity.

1238
01:21:20,963 --> 01:21:23,327
For your honor.

1239
01:21:23,463 --> 01:21:25,860
I love you.

1240
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:30,921
The boy had to be let go.

1241
01:21:32,063 --> 01:21:34,963
The boy had to be given a chance.

1242
01:21:34,963 --> 01:21:36,696
And if to do that,

1243
01:21:36,696 --> 01:21:38,729
I had to say, 

1244
01:21:38,729 --> 01:21:40,563
" Fuck you, and fuck what I owe you,

1245
01:21:40,563 --> 01:21:42,430
"and fuck everything that's gone on between us,"

1246
01:21:42,430 --> 01:21:45,123
then that's what I had to do.

1247
01:21:45,662 --> 01:21:48,561
But I'm not fighting you.

1248
01:21:49,330 --> 01:21:51,263
And I accept, totally, everything you've got to do.

1249
01:21:51,263 --> 01:21:53,990
I accept it. Totally.

1250
01:21:57,063 --> 01:21:59,256
Oh, yeah?

1251
01:22:00,629 --> 01:22:02,357
Yeah.

1252
01:22:06,796 --> 01:22:08,530
Well, you say all that fucking stuff, 

1253
01:22:08,530 --> 01:22:11,257
I can't fucking shoot you now, can I?

1254
01:22:12,762 --> 01:22:15,296
It's entirely up to you, Harry.

1255
01:22:15,296 --> 01:22:17,727
It's entirely your call.

1256
01:22:18,796 --> 01:22:20,896
All I'm saying is

1257
01:22:20,896 --> 01:22:23,192
I'm not fighting.

1258
01:22:29,729 --> 01:22:30,896
Oh, you fucking cunt!

1259
01:22:30,896 --> 01:22:32,196
Look, I'm not gonna do nothing to you

1260
01:22:32,196 --> 01:22:35,060
just 'Cause you're standing about like Robert fucking Powell.

1261
01:22:36,729 --> 01:22:37,296
Like who?

1262
01:22:37,296 --> 01:22:40,196
Like Robert fucking Powell out of Jesus of fucking Nazareth!

1263
01:22:40,196 --> 01:22:42,096
My fucking leg!

1264
01:22:42,096 --> 01:22:46,063
The psycho dwarf turns out to just be a loveable little schoolboy,

1265
01:22:46,063 --> 01:22:48,696
and it's all some kind of Boschian nightmare.

1266
01:22:48,696 --> 01:22:50,396
Kiss my ass!

1267
01:22:50,396 --> 01:22:54,351
I guess at least there weren't any black people involved, eh, Jimmy?

1268
01:22:55,629 --> 01:22:57,829
I wasn't...

1269
01:22:57,829 --> 01:23:00,522
I wasn't talking about...

1270
01:23:01,163 --> 01:23:04,163
There's gonna be a war between all the blacks and all the whites.

1271
01:23:04,163 --> 01:23:06,929
And all the black midgets and all the white midgets,

1272
01:23:06,929 --> 01:23:08,296
which would actually be really good.

1273
01:23:08,296 --> 01:23:10,096
That's just cocaine.

1274
01:23:10,096 --> 01:23:12,562
He didn't even want the Vietnamese on his side!

1275
01:23:12,562 --> 01:23:15,762
That's just cocaine.

1276
01:23:15,762 --> 01:23:19,562
Listen, we're filming down by the pointy building tonight.

1277
01:23:19,562 --> 01:23:22,085
It might actually be good for once.

1278
01:23:23,330 --> 01:23:25,396
You guys should come along.

1279
01:23:25,396 --> 01:23:27,129
We... 

1280
01:23:27,129 --> 01:23:30,696
I think we're just gonna have a quiet one tonight, Jimmy.

1281
01:23:30,696 --> 01:23:34,220
That's how it is!

1282
01:23:36,029 --> 01:23:38,325
In another life.

1283
01:23:44,363 --> 01:23:46,760
They're great, aren't they?

1284
01:24:01,729 --> 01:24:02,529
You didn't. 

1285
01:24:02,963 --> 01:24:04,588
You didn't!

1286
01:24:52,829 --> 01:24:54,296
Mr. Waters? 

1287
01:24:54,296 --> 01:24:56,159
Mr. Waters?

1288
01:24:57,629 --> 01:24:59,263
Who's that?

1289
01:24:59,263 --> 01:25:01,354
It's Eirik.

1290
01:25:01,596 --> 01:25:02,829
The blind boy?

1291
01:25:02,829 --> 01:25:04,852
Yeah.

1292
01:25:05,063 --> 01:25:06,824
Yes.

1293
01:25:07,129 --> 01:25:09,395
What do you fucking want?

1294
01:25:09,395 --> 01:25:12,759
The guy you're looking for,the guy Ray,

1295
01:25:12,896 --> 01:25:15,521
he's downstairs at the bar.

1296
01:25:50,562 --> 01:25:53,230
I'm sorry, Ken.

1297
01:25:53,230 --> 01:25:57,685
But you can't kill a kid and expect to get away with it.

1298
01:25:58,729 --> 01:26:00,854
You just can't.

1299
01:26:15,729 --> 01:26:16,395
Where?

1300
01:26:16,395 --> 01:26:18,263
To the left when you come out.

1301
01:26:18,263 --> 01:26:20,286
The bar to the left.

1302
01:26:47,762 --> 01:26:56,457
(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)

1303
01:26:57,029 --> 01:27:01,063


1304
01:27:01,063 --> 01:27:04,629


1305
01:27:04,629 --> 01:27:13,729


1306
01:27:13,729 --> 01:27:20,628


1307
01:27:20,929 --> 01:27:28,885


1308
01:27:29,129 --> 01:27:35,652


1309
01:27:35,929 --> 01:27:39,896


1310
01:27:39,896 --> 01:27:43,596


1311
01:27:43,596 --> 01:27:52,018


1312
01:27:52,596 --> 01:27:59,963


1313
01:27:59,963 --> 01:28:07,327


1314
01:28:07,729 --> 01:28:15,096


1315
01:28:15,096 --> 01:28:21,329


1316
01:28:21,329 --> 01:28:28,129


1317
01:28:28,129 --> 01:28:34,929


1318
01:28:34,929 --> 01:28:38,963


1319
01:28:38,963 --> 01:28:42,929


1320
01:28:42,929 --> 01:28:50,487


1321
01:28:51,163 --> 01:28:55,963


1322
01:28:55,963 --> 01:29:00,096


1323
01:29:00,096 --> 01:29:12,154


1324
01:29:37,195 --> 01:29:38,456
Ken!

1325
01:29:39,929 --> 01:29:41,063
Ken! 

1326
01:29:41,063 --> 01:29:43,290
Ken!

1327
01:29:45,128 --> 01:29:47,356
Harry's here.

1328
01:29:47,863 --> 01:29:50,056
What?

1329
01:29:51,262 --> 01:29:53,996
Take

1330
01:29:53,996 --> 01:29:56,393
my gun.

1331
01:30:08,762 --> 01:30:10,929
Ken?

1332
01:30:10,929 --> 01:30:12,986
Where's my gun?

1333
01:30:14,462 --> 01:30:16,826
Where's my gun?

1334
01:30:19,095 --> 01:30:21,729
I'm gonna die now, 

1335
01:30:21,729 --> 01:30:23,661
I think.

1336
01:30:24,262 --> 01:30:26,558
Oh, Ken!

1337
01:30:27,562 --> 01:30:29,494
Jesus!

1338
01:32:36,295 --> 01:32:37,896
Mr. Blakely said you had left.

1339
01:32:37,896 --> 01:32:39,128
I need the key to the room right now.

1340
01:32:39,128 --> 01:32:40,890
Quickly, now!

1341
01:32:41,629 --> 01:32:43,629
And you gotta go home right now. It's very, very dangerous here.

1342
01:32:43,629 --> 01:32:43,962
All right?

1343
01:32:43,962 --> 01:32:44,962
 Go home! Right now!

1344
01:32:44,962 --> 01:32:46,087
Okay.

1345
01:32:57,229 --> 01:33:00,389


1346
01:33:26,095 --> 01:33:28,323


1347
01:33:30,262 --> 01:33:32,295
MARIE: No, I won't let you up there! 

1348
01:33:32,295 --> 01:33:34,496
Put that gun away, right now!

1349
01:33:34,496 --> 01:33:35,995
HARRY: Lady, get out of my fucking way, please.

1350
01:33:35,995 --> 01:33:37,529
No, I won't. 

1351
01:33:37,529 --> 01:33:39,722
I won't get out of your way.

1352
01:33:40,162 --> 01:33:41,895
You'll have to go through me.

1353
01:33:41,895 --> 01:33:44,596
Well, obviously, I'm not gonna through you, am I, with a baby and that?

1354
01:33:44,596 --> 01:33:48,050
I'm a nice person. But could you just get out of the fucking way, please?

1355
01:33:53,696 --> 01:33:55,491
Marie!

1356
01:33:55,796 --> 01:33:58,162
Just let him come up, it's okay.

1357
01:33:58,162 --> 01:33:59,329
Harry, 

1358
01:33:59,329 --> 01:34:01,529
swear not to start shooting until she's left the hotel.

1359
01:34:01,529 --> 01:34:04,095
I swear not to start shooting till she's left the hotel.

1360
01:34:04,095 --> 01:34:04,995
I totally swear.

1361
01:34:04,995 --> 01:34:07,120
Well, I'm not going anywhere.

1362
01:34:07,596 --> 01:34:09,762
This is my hotel.

1363
01:34:09,762 --> 01:34:12,125
So you can fuck off!

1364
01:34:24,162 --> 01:34:26,262
I suppose you've got a gun up there?

1365
01:34:26,262 --> 01:34:27,989
Yeah.

1366
01:34:28,329 --> 01:34:31,028
Then what are we gonna do? We can't stand here all night.

1367
01:34:31,028 --> 01:34:34,128
Why don't you both put your guns down and go home?

1368
01:34:34,128 --> 01:34:36,162
Don't be stupid.

1369
01:34:36,162 --> 01:34:38,560
This is the shootout.

1370
01:34:38,895 --> 01:34:40,229
Harry, 

1371
01:34:40,229 --> 01:34:41,229
I've got an idea.

1372
01:34:41,229 --> 01:34:42,062
What?

1373
01:34:42,062 --> 01:34:44,362
My room faces onto the canal, right?

1374
01:34:44,362 --> 01:34:47,262
I'm gonna go back to me room, jump into the canal,

1375
01:34:47,262 --> 01:34:49,395
see if I can swim to the other side and escape.

1376
01:34:49,395 --> 01:34:49,862
Right.

1377
01:34:49,862 --> 01:34:51,696
If you go outside and round the corner,

1378
01:34:51,696 --> 01:34:53,995
you can shoot at me from there and try and get me.

1379
01:34:53,995 --> 01:34:56,562
That way, we leave this lady and her baby out of the whole, entire thing.

1380
01:34:56,562 --> 01:34:58,995
Do you completely promise to jump into the canal?

1381
01:34:58,995 --> 01:35:00,795
I don't want to run out there, come back in 10 minutes

1382
01:35:00,795 --> 01:35:02,496
and find you fucking hiding in a cupboard.

1383
01:35:02,496 --> 01:35:04,028
I completely promise, Harry.

1384
01:35:04,028 --> 01:35:06,229
I'm not gonna risk having another little kid die, am I?

1385
01:35:06,229 --> 01:35:10,429
So, hang on, I go outside, then I go which way, right or left?

1386
01:35:10,429 --> 01:35:12,062
You go right, don't you?

1387
01:35:12,062 --> 01:35:15,062
You can see it from the doorway! It's a big fucking canal!

1388
01:35:15,062 --> 01:35:18,095
All right. Jesus! I've only just got here, haven't I?

1389
01:35:18,095 --> 01:35:20,962
Okay. On a count of "one, two, three, go," okay?

1390
01:35:20,962 --> 01:35:22,860
Okay.

1391
01:35:28,095 --> 01:35:29,529
What? Who says it?

1392
01:35:29,529 --> 01:35:30,862
Oh, you say it.

1393
01:35:30,862 --> 01:35:32,895
You guys are crazy.

1394
01:35:32,895 --> 01:35:33,529
Are you ready?

1395
01:35:33,529 --> 01:35:34,362
Ready.

1396
01:35:34,362 --> 01:35:34,795
Set?

1397
01:35:34,795 --> 01:35:35,995
Set.

1398
01:35:35,995 --> 01:35:37,790
One, two, three, go!

1399
01:35:51,895 --> 01:35:53,918
Keep driving!

1400
01:36:00,395 --> 01:36:03,418
No way. You're way too far away.

1401
01:38:05,529 --> 01:38:07,229
The little boy.

1402
01:38:07,229 --> 01:38:09,252
That's right, Ray.

1403
01:38:09,429 --> 01:38:11,418
The little boy.

1404
01:39:19,962 --> 01:39:22,019
I see.

1405
01:39:27,795 --> 01:39:29,761
No, Harry.

1406
01:39:30,528 --> 01:39:34,528
He's not...

1407
01:39:34,528 --> 01:39:37,585
You've got to stick to your principles.

1408
01:40:03,561 --> 01:40:07,262
RAY. ; There's a Christmas tree somewhere in London with a bunch of presents

1409
01:40:07,262 --> 01:40:09,455
underneath it that'll never be opened.

1410
01:40:09,995 --> 01:40:12,462
And I thought, "If I survive all this,

1411
01:40:12,462 --> 01:40:14,095
I'll go to that house,

1412
01:40:14,095 --> 01:40:15,761
"apologize to the mother there,

1413
01:40:15,761 --> 01:40:18,784
"and accept whatever punishment she chose for me."

1414
01:40:19,295 --> 01:40:20,895
Prison, 

1415
01:40:20,895 --> 01:40:23,962
death, it didn't matter.

1416
01:40:23,962 --> 01:40:25,828
Because at least in prison and at least in death, you know,

1417
01:40:25,828 --> 01:40:29,885
I wouldn't be in fucking Bruges.

1418
01:40:32,295 --> 01:40:35,495
But then, like a flash, it came to me, 

1419
01:40:35,495 --> 01:40:38,595
and I realized,

1420
01:40:38,595 --> 01:40:42,153
"Fuck, man, maybe that's what Hell is.

1421
01:40:42,828 --> 01:40:46,658
"The entire rest of eternity spent in fucking Bruges!"

1422
01:40:51,095 --> 01:40:53,890
And I really, really hoped I wouldn't die.

1423
01:40:56,395 --> 01:40:59,259
I really, really hoped I wouldn't die.
