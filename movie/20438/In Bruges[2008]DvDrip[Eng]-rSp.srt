0
00:00:54,807 --> 00:00:58,561
After I killed them,
I dropped the gun in the Thames,

1
00:00:58,647 --> 00:01:01,684
washed the residue off me hands
in the bathroom of a Burger King,

2
00:01:01,767 --> 00:01:04,281
and walked home to await instructions,

3
00:01:05,287 --> 00:01:08,359
Shortly thereafter,
the instructions came through,

4
00:01:08,847 --> 00:01:12,044
"Get the fuck out of London,
youse dumb fucks,

5
00:01:12,127 --> 00:01:13,640
"Get to Bruges,"

6
00:01:15,127 --> 00:01:17,925
I didn't even know where Bruges
fucking was,

7
00:01:21,807 --> 00:01:23,320
Is in Belgium,

8
00:01:26,807 --> 00:01:29,196
- Bruges is a shithole,
- Bruges is not a shithole,

9
00:01:29,287 --> 00:01:30,276
Bruges is a shithole,

10
00:01:30,367 --> 00:01:32,244
Ray, we've only just got off
the fucking train,

11
00:01:32,327 --> 00:01:35,125
Could we reserve judgement on Bruges
until we've seen the fucking place?

12
00:01:35,207 --> 00:01:36,686
I know is gonna be a shithole,

13
00:02:03,967 --> 00:02:05,195
Shithole,

14
00:02:10,407 --> 00:02:14,559
I think you have a couple of rooms booked
under Cranham and Blakely?

15
00:02:14,647 --> 00:02:17,684
Yes, No, we have one room booked,

16
00:02:18,327 --> 00:02:20,682
One twin room, Booked for two weeks,

17
00:02:21,527 --> 00:02:22,801
Two weeks!

18
00:02:23,447 --> 00:02:26,120
- Do you have another room?
- No, I'm afraid we're fully booked,

19
00:02:26,207 --> 00:02:29,005
With Christmas, everywhere is fully booked,

20
00:02:29,887 --> 00:02:31,002
Okay,

21
00:02:36,287 --> 00:02:37,686
Is very pretty,

22
00:02:37,767 --> 00:02:41,077
- I'm not being funny, we can't stay here,
- We've got to stay here until he rings,

23
00:02:41,167 --> 00:02:44,079
- Well, what if he doesn't ring for two weeks?
- Then we stay here for two weeks,

24
00:02:44,167 --> 00:02:47,796
For two weeks? In fucking Bruges?
In a room like this?

25
00:02:47,887 --> 00:02:49,445
With you? No way!

26
00:02:49,527 --> 00:02:54,476
- Ray, I really don't like to say this,,,
- You really don't like to say what?

27
00:02:54,567 --> 00:02:56,205
Well,,, You know?

28
00:02:58,607 --> 00:03:00,404
Fucking bring that up,

29
00:03:35,367 --> 00:03:37,517
Do you think this is good?

30
00:03:37,607 --> 00:03:39,563
Do I think whas good?

31
00:03:39,647 --> 00:03:42,684
You know, going round in a boat,
looking at stuff,

32
00:03:43,367 --> 00:03:45,164
Yes, I do,

33
00:03:46,647 --> 00:03:48,603
Is called "sightseeing,"

34
00:03:58,007 --> 00:03:59,565
Oh, look at that,

35
00:04:02,847 --> 00:04:06,157
Is a former hospital, From the 1100s,

36
00:04:08,967 --> 00:04:11,322
Bruges is the most
well-preserved medieval town

37
00:04:11,407 --> 00:04:13,682
in the whole of Belgium, apparently,

38
00:04:34,767 --> 00:04:36,997
- Coming up?
- Whas up there?

39
00:04:38,047 --> 00:04:39,605
The view,

40
00:04:39,687 --> 00:04:43,282
The view of what? The view of down here?
I can see that from down here,

41
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:47,519
Ray, you're about the worst tourist
in the whole world,

42
00:04:47,607 --> 00:04:50,838
Ken, I grew up in Dublin, I love Dublin,

43
00:04:50,927 --> 00:04:54,442
If I'd grown up on a farm and was retarded,
Bruges might impress me,

44
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:56,518
But I didn't, so it doesn't,

45
00:05:08,647 --> 00:05:10,683
Trying to get rid of me coins,

46
00:05:10,767 --> 00:05:13,679
3, 3,50, 4,

47
00:05:13,767 --> 00:05:19,046
4,10, 4,20, 4,30, 4,40, 4,50, 4,60,

48
00:05:19,127 --> 00:05:21,243
4,70,

49
00:05:21,327 --> 00:05:22,760
4,80,

50
00:05:24,127 --> 00:05:25,845
4,90,

51
00:05:28,047 --> 00:05:30,197
Will you take 4,90?

52
00:05:30,287 --> 00:05:32,084
Entry is 5 euro,

53
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:36,996
- Come on, man, is only 10 cents,
- Entry is 5 euro,

54
00:05:47,927 --> 00:05:50,202
- Happy in your work?
- Very happy,

55
00:06:25,127 --> 00:06:26,606
I like it here,

56
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:55,642
Been to the top of the tower?

57
00:06:55,727 --> 00:06:59,037
Yeah, Yeah, is rubbish,

58
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:02,085
It is? The guidebook says is a "must-see",

59
00:07:03,087 --> 00:07:07,080
- Well, you lot ain't going up there,
- Pardon me? Why?

60
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:10,921
I mean, is all windy stairs,
I'm not being funny,

61
00:07:11,007 --> 00:07:13,396
What exactly are you trying to say?

62
00:07:14,047 --> 00:07:18,404
What exactly am I trying to say?
Youse are a bunch of fucking elephants!

63
00:07:18,487 --> 00:07:19,886
Right, you,,,

64
00:07:26,887 --> 00:07:28,798
Come on, leave it, fatty,

65
00:07:37,967 --> 00:07:41,198
You know, you're just the rudest man,
The rudest man!

66
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,644
Whas all that about?

67
00:07:45,647 --> 00:07:46,921
They're not going up there,

68
00:07:47,007 --> 00:07:50,283
Hey, guys, I wouldn't go up there,
Is really narrow,

69
00:07:50,367 --> 00:07:52,323
Screw you, motherfucker!

70
00:07:55,527 --> 00:07:57,279
Americans, isn't it?

71
00:08:01,767 --> 00:08:04,884
Now, this is more like it, Proper holidays,

72
00:08:04,967 --> 00:08:09,324
One gay beer for my gay friend, and one
normal beer for me, because I am normal,

73
00:08:10,167 --> 00:08:11,520
This is the life,

74
00:08:11,607 --> 00:08:14,075
We're not staying here getting pissed,

75
00:08:14,487 --> 00:08:18,878
We are quietly sightseeing, like he says, and
awaiting his call to see what we do next,

76
00:08:18,967 --> 00:08:23,358
This is my vote on what we should do,
We give it another day, two days, max,

77
00:08:23,887 --> 00:08:26,162
Then we check the papers again,
and if there's still nothing in them,

78
00:08:26,247 --> 00:08:29,364
we phone him and say,
"Harry, thank you for the trip to Bruges,

79
00:08:29,447 --> 00:08:31,756
"is been very nice,
all the old buildings and that,

80
00:08:31,847 --> 00:08:34,441
"but we're coming back to London now,
and hide out in a proper country,

81
00:08:34,527 --> 00:08:36,677
"where it isn't all just fucking chocolates,"

82
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:40,123
My vote would be we quietly sightsee,
like he says,

83
00:08:40,767 --> 00:08:43,486
and await his call to see what we do next,

84
00:08:46,407 --> 00:08:49,001
You don't even know we're here hiding out,

85
00:08:50,647 --> 00:08:52,046
What are you talking about?

86
00:08:52,127 --> 00:08:54,322
You don't even know
we're not here on a job,

87
00:08:54,407 --> 00:08:56,318
- What, on a job?
- Yeah,

88
00:08:56,407 --> 00:08:57,886
- Here in Bruges?
- Yeah,

89
00:08:57,967 --> 00:09:00,242
- Here in Bruges, on a job?
- Yeah,

90
00:09:00,967 --> 00:09:04,004
- Why? What did he actually say?
- He didn't actually say anything,

91
00:09:04,087 --> 00:09:06,885
- Then why do you think it might be?
- I don't think anything,

92
00:09:06,967 --> 00:09:09,765
But is a bit fucking over-elaborate, isn't it?

93
00:09:09,847 --> 00:09:12,281
"Go take him to hide out,"
"Go take him to hide out where?"

94
00:09:12,367 --> 00:09:15,120
"Go take him to hide out in fucking Bruges,"

95
00:09:16,487 --> 00:09:18,557
You can hide out in Croydon,

96
00:09:21,927 --> 00:09:23,246
Or Coventry,

97
00:09:28,607 --> 00:09:30,598
It is a bit over-elaborate,

98
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:38,402
- But we haven't got any guns,
- Harry can get guns anywhere,

99
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:01,803
He's not gonna ring tonight,

100
00:10:08,247 --> 00:10:10,238
He's not gonna ring tonight,

101
00:10:11,767 --> 00:10:13,246
Les go out,

102
00:10:13,327 --> 00:10:15,158
- Go out where?
- The pub,

103
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:16,282
No!

104
00:10:33,887 --> 00:10:35,684
Les go out and have a look
at some of the,,,

105
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:38,327
All the old medieval buildings and that,

106
00:10:38,407 --> 00:10:41,797
Because I bet they look even better at night,
all lit up,

107
00:10:46,127 --> 00:10:47,162
Yes!

108
00:10:56,247 --> 00:10:59,125
That there is called the Gruuthuse Muzeum,

109
00:10:59,207 --> 00:11:02,677
- They all have funny names, don't they?
- Yes, Flemish,

110
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:06,526
In here it says, "The Belgians
twice sheltered fugitive English Kings

111
00:11:06,607 --> 00:11:09,360
"from being murdered, 1471 and 1651,"

112
00:11:09,447 --> 00:11:11,642
I used to hate history, didn't you?

113
00:11:11,727 --> 00:11:14,036
Is all just a load of stuff
thas already happened,

114
00:11:14,127 --> 00:11:15,958
What are they doing over there?

115
00:11:16,047 --> 00:11:18,925
They're filming something,
They're filming midgets!

116
00:11:20,007 --> 00:11:21,076
Ray!

117
00:11:23,647 --> 00:11:28,004
So, on this scene, you're supposed to walk
like a little, tiny mouse, yeah?

118
00:11:31,167 --> 00:11:33,078
Okay? Great,

119
00:11:36,127 --> 00:11:37,446
Ray, come on, les go,

120
00:11:37,527 --> 00:11:40,246
My arse, "Les go," They're filming midgets,

121
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:44,684
Oh, my God! Look at that girl,

122
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,200
She's gorgeous!

123
00:11:46,287 --> 00:11:48,926
- Ray, we're going right now,
- Fuck off, are we!

124
00:11:49,007 --> 00:11:52,682
This is the best bit of Bruges so far,
You and your buildings,

125
00:12:16,207 --> 00:12:17,322
Hello,

126
00:12:19,927 --> 00:12:22,441
- Do you speak English?
- No,

127
00:12:23,687 --> 00:12:26,326
Yes, you do, Everybody does,

128
00:12:26,407 --> 00:12:28,921
What are you filming midgets for?

129
00:12:29,007 --> 00:12:32,204
Is a Dutch movie, Is a dream sequence,

130
00:12:33,207 --> 00:12:35,482
Is a pastiche of
Nicholas Roeg's Don't Look Now,

131
00:12:35,567 --> 00:12:37,444
Not a pastiche, but a,,,

132
00:12:38,487 --> 00:12:41,877
A "homage" is too strong,
A "nod of the head"?

133
00:12:44,167 --> 00:12:46,362
Wow, your English is very good,

134
00:12:50,847 --> 00:12:53,441
A lot of midgets tend to kill themselves,

135
00:12:55,847 --> 00:12:58,042
A disproportionate amount,

136
00:12:58,567 --> 00:13:01,445
Herve Villechaize, off of Fantasy Island,

137
00:13:02,687 --> 00:13:05,406
I think somebody off The Time Bandits,

138
00:13:05,487 --> 00:13:08,604
I suppose they must
get really sad about, like,

139
00:13:09,887 --> 00:13:11,559
being really little and that,

140
00:13:11,647 --> 00:13:14,115
People looking at them
and laughing at them,

141
00:13:14,207 --> 00:13:17,324
Calling them names, You know, "shortarse,"

142
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:22,841
There's another famous midget I'm missing,
but I can't remember,

143
00:13:23,967 --> 00:13:26,640
Is not the R2-D2 man, No, he's still going,

144
00:13:27,967 --> 00:13:32,404
I hope your midget doesn't kill himself,
Your dream sequence will be fucked,

145
00:13:33,087 --> 00:13:35,476
He doesn't like being called a midget,
He prefers "dwarf,"

146
00:13:35,567 --> 00:13:37,842
Well, this is exactly my point!

147
00:13:37,927 --> 00:13:40,919
People go around calling you a midget
when you want to be called a dwarf,

148
00:13:41,007 --> 00:13:43,680
Of course you're gonna blow your head off!

149
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:47,967
- My name's Ray, Whas yours?
- Chloe,

150
00:13:50,367 --> 00:13:51,959
How did you get past the security man?

151
00:13:52,047 --> 00:13:55,244
Getting past security men,
is sort of my job,

152
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:58,285
- You're a shoplifter?
- No, not a shoplifter,

153
00:13:58,367 --> 00:14:00,244
Is a good joke, though,

154
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:02,276
No,

155
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:05,919
I'll tell you what I am
at dinner tomorrow night,

156
00:14:21,247 --> 00:14:22,362
Fuck,

157
00:14:34,847 --> 00:14:36,565
How fucking cool,

158
00:14:47,207 --> 00:14:48,925
Mr Blakely?

159
00:14:49,007 --> 00:14:52,556
Yes, No, Mr Cranham,
No, Yes, Mr Blakely, Yes,

160
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:57,124
You have a message,

161
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:03,236
Shit!

162
00:15:04,087 --> 00:15:07,124
Number one, why aren't you in
when I fucking told you to be in?

163
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:10,199
Number two, why doesn't this hotel
have phones with fucking voicemail

164
00:15:10,287 --> 00:15:12,801
and not I have to leave messages
with the fucking receptionist?

165
00:15:12,887 --> 00:15:15,765
Number three, you better fucking be in
tomorrow night when I fucking call again

166
00:15:15,847 --> 00:15:19,806
or there'll be fucking Hell to pay,
I'm fucking telling you, Harry,

167
00:15:55,567 --> 00:15:57,922
Would you turn the fucking light off!

168
00:15:58,007 --> 00:15:59,440
Sorry, Ken,

169
00:15:59,527 --> 00:16:01,563
Keep the fucking noise down!

170
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,325
Someone's in a mood,

171
00:16:20,167 --> 00:16:21,202
You'll never guess what,

172
00:16:21,287 --> 00:16:23,278
Will you shut your fucking mouth, please,
and go to sleep?

173
00:16:23,367 --> 00:16:24,959
Oh, sorry,

174
00:16:29,247 --> 00:16:32,159
Except I've gotta take me contact lenses out,

175
00:16:38,967 --> 00:16:40,400
Altogether,

176
00:16:40,487 --> 00:16:41,840
I had

177
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,925
five pints of beer and six bottles,

178
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:51,480
No, Six pints of beer and seven bottles,

179
00:16:51,567 --> 00:16:54,081
And you know what? I'm not even pissed!

180
00:16:59,767 --> 00:17:01,837
You'll never guess what, Ken,

181
00:17:03,447 --> 00:17:05,517
- Ken, you'll never guess what,
- What?

182
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:07,757
- Got a date for tomorrow night,
- I'm very happy for you,

183
00:17:07,847 --> 00:17:10,236
- With a girl,
- Can you turn the light off, please?

184
00:17:10,327 --> 00:17:13,046
Only been in Bruges one day,
got a date with a girl in the film business,

185
00:17:13,127 --> 00:17:15,118
the Belgian film business,

186
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:18,761
They're doing a film about a midget,

187
00:17:36,407 --> 00:17:37,442
Miss?

188
00:17:38,247 --> 00:17:39,362
Marie?

189
00:17:42,487 --> 00:17:46,719
Sorry about the message last night,
The man who left it is a bit of a,,,

190
00:17:48,127 --> 00:17:50,038
Well, he's a bit of a,,,

191
00:17:50,647 --> 00:17:51,682
Cock?

192
00:17:52,807 --> 00:17:54,763
Yes, He's a bit of a cock,

193
00:17:57,887 --> 00:17:59,081
Morning,

194
00:18:07,967 --> 00:18:09,878
Harry called last night,

195
00:18:10,487 --> 00:18:11,966
We missed him,

196
00:18:14,647 --> 00:18:17,036
Jeez, he swears a lot, doesn't he?

197
00:18:18,167 --> 00:18:21,125
We're staying in tonight, Whatever happens,

198
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,401
Except,,,

199
00:18:29,287 --> 00:18:30,800
Except "hmm" what?

200
00:18:30,887 --> 00:18:35,438
Except only one of us
needs to stay in, really,

201
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:40,767
And which one of us
would that be, now, Ray?

202
00:18:40,847 --> 00:18:43,998
- I thought you didn't like Bruges,
- I don't like Bruges, is a shithole,

203
00:18:44,087 --> 00:18:47,716
But I did already say
I had a date with a Belgian lady

204
00:18:47,807 --> 00:18:51,686
in the Belgian film business,
which I did already say about before,

205
00:18:55,967 --> 00:18:58,606
Just don't get into any fucking trouble,

206
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,678
We're keeping a low profile,

207
00:19:01,287 --> 00:19:07,203
And this morning, and this afternoon,
we are doing what I want to do,

208
00:19:07,287 --> 00:19:08,959
- Got it?
- Of course,

209
00:19:09,807 --> 00:19:11,604
Which, I presume, will involve culture,

210
00:19:11,687 --> 00:19:15,236
Oh, we shall strike a balance
between culture and fun,

211
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:19,718
Somehow I believe, Ken, that the balance
shall tip in the favour of culture,

212
00:19:20,687 --> 00:19:24,362
Like a big, fat,
fucking retarded, fucking black girl

213
00:19:24,447 --> 00:19:27,041
on a seesaw, opposite

214
00:19:30,607 --> 00:19:31,835
a dwarf,

215
00:20:06,447 --> 00:20:10,440
Ray, did we or did we not agree
that if I let you go on your date tonight,

216
00:20:10,527 --> 00:20:12,358
we'd do the things I wanted to do today?

217
00:20:12,447 --> 00:20:14,244
We are doing the things
that you wanted to do today,

218
00:20:14,327 --> 00:20:16,761
And that we'd do them
without you throwing a fucking moody,

219
00:20:16,847 --> 00:20:19,077
like some 5-year-old
who's dropped all his sweets?

220
00:20:19,167 --> 00:20:21,044
I didn't agree to that,

221
00:20:21,807 --> 00:20:23,877
I'll cheer up, I'll cheer up,

222
00:20:24,287 --> 00:20:27,120
Up there, the top altar, is a phial

223
00:20:27,887 --> 00:20:31,243
brought back by a Flemish knight
from the Crusades in the Holy Land,

224
00:20:31,327 --> 00:20:33,795
And that phial,
do you know what is said to contain?

225
00:20:33,887 --> 00:20:35,366
No, whas it said to contain?

226
00:20:35,447 --> 00:20:39,235
Is said to contain
some drops of Jesus Chriss blood,

227
00:20:39,327 --> 00:20:42,876
Yeah, thas how this church got its name,
Basilica of the Holy Blood,

228
00:20:42,967 --> 00:20:44,241
- Yeah?
- Yeah,

229
00:20:44,327 --> 00:20:47,080
And this blood, right,
though is dried blood,

230
00:20:47,167 --> 00:20:51,080
at different times over many years,
they say it turned back into liquid,

231
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,681
Turned back into liquid from dried blood,

232
00:20:53,767 --> 00:20:55,803
At various times of great

233
00:20:57,327 --> 00:20:58,521
stress,

234
00:20:58,607 --> 00:20:59,835
- Yeah?
- Yeah,

235
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:04,796
So, yeah, I'm gonna go up in the queue
and touch it, which is what you do,

236
00:21:04,887 --> 00:21:06,923
- Yeah?
- Yeah, You coming?

237
00:21:07,927 --> 00:21:09,360
Do I have to?

238
00:21:10,847 --> 00:21:13,645
Do you have to?
Of course you don't have to,

239
00:21:13,727 --> 00:21:17,436
Is Jesus' fucking blood, isn't it?
Of course you don't fucking have to!

240
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:19,916
Of course you don't fucking have to!

241
00:22:02,047 --> 00:22:03,958
You little fucking cunt,

242
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:37,478
Murder, Father,

243
00:22:38,767 --> 00:22:40,917
Why did you murder someone, Raymond?

244
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:44,478
For money, Father,

245
00:22:44,847 --> 00:22:46,166
For money?

246
00:22:47,247 --> 00:22:50,125
- You murdered someone for money?
- Yes, Father,

247
00:22:50,207 --> 00:22:53,324
Not out of anger, not out of nothing,
For money,

248
00:22:55,887 --> 00:22:58,355
Who did you murder for money, Raymond?

249
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:00,440
You, Father,

250
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:03,562
I'm sorry?

251
00:23:03,647 --> 00:23:06,207
I said you, Father, What, are you deaf?

252
00:23:06,607 --> 00:23:08,518
Harry Waters says hello,

253
00:23:24,847 --> 00:23:26,599
The little boy,

254
00:25:08,887 --> 00:25:10,878
I quite like this one,

255
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:15,040
All the rest were rubbish by spastics,
but this one's quite good,

256
00:25:15,127 --> 00:25:17,038
Whas that all about, then?

257
00:25:17,887 --> 00:25:21,846
- Is Judgement Day, you know?
- Oh, yeah,

258
00:25:24,767 --> 00:25:30,239
- Whas that then?
- Well, is, you know, the final day on Earth,

259
00:25:30,927 --> 00:25:35,717
When mankind will be judged for
all the crimes they've committed and that,

260
00:25:37,247 --> 00:25:40,523
And see who gets into Heaven
and who gets into Hell and all that?

261
00:25:40,607 --> 00:25:41,642
Yeah,

262
00:25:41,727 --> 00:25:44,685
- And whas the other place?
- Purgatory,

263
00:25:44,767 --> 00:25:46,917
Purgatory?

264
00:25:47,007 --> 00:25:49,965
Purgatory's kind of like
the in-betweeny one,

265
00:25:50,047 --> 00:25:53,835
You weren't really shit,
but you weren't all that great, either,

266
00:25:54,447 --> 00:25:55,926
Like Tottenham,

267
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:59,202
Do you believe in all that stuff, Ken?

268
00:25:59,287 --> 00:26:00,686
About Tottenham?

269
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:03,042
The Last Judgement and the afterlife,

270
00:26:05,887 --> 00:26:08,765
Guilt and sins and

271
00:26:10,207 --> 00:26:12,846
Hell and all that?

272
00:26:26,927 --> 00:26:29,885
I don't know, Ray,
I don't know what I believe,

273
00:26:30,247 --> 00:26:33,557
The things you're taught as a child,
they never really leave you, do they?

274
00:26:33,647 --> 00:26:35,797
So, like, I believe
in trying to lead a good life,

275
00:26:35,887 --> 00:26:39,402
Like, if there's an old lady,
carrying her shopping home,

276
00:26:39,487 --> 00:26:43,036
I don't try and help her carry her shopping,
I don't go that far,

277
00:26:43,127 --> 00:26:47,120
but I'll certainly hold the door open for her
and that, and let her go out before me,

278
00:26:47,207 --> 00:26:49,118
Yeah, And anyway, if you tried
to help her carry her shopping,

279
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:51,163
she'd probably think
you were just trying to nick her shopping,

280
00:26:51,247 --> 00:26:53,966
- Exactly,
- This is the world we live in today,

281
00:26:54,047 --> 00:26:57,198
At the same time
as trying to lead a good life,

282
00:26:58,527 --> 00:27:02,679
I have to reconcile myself with the fact
that, yes, I have killed people,

283
00:27:03,607 --> 00:27:06,997
Not many people,
Most of them were not very nice people,

284
00:27:07,527 --> 00:27:09,597
Apart from one person,

285
00:27:09,687 --> 00:27:13,396
- Who's that?
- This fellow, Danny Alibanïs brother,

286
00:27:13,487 --> 00:27:16,797
He was just trying to protect his brother,
Like you or I would,

287
00:27:16,887 --> 00:27:19,082
He was just a lollipop man,

288
00:27:19,167 --> 00:27:22,443
He came at me with a bottle,
What are you gonna do?

289
00:27:22,527 --> 00:27:24,085
I shot him down,

290
00:27:25,567 --> 00:27:29,196
In my book, though, sorry,
someone comes at you with a bottle,

291
00:27:29,287 --> 00:27:31,721
that is a deadly weapon,
he's gotta take the consequences,

292
00:27:31,807 --> 00:27:33,081
I know that in my heart,

293
00:27:33,167 --> 00:27:35,397
I also know that he was just trying
to protect his brother, you know?

294
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:38,877
I know, But a bottle, that can kill you,
Is a case of is you or him,

295
00:27:38,967 --> 00:27:40,844
If he'd come at you with his bare hands,
thad be different,

296
00:27:40,927 --> 00:27:41,916
That wouldn't have been fair,

297
00:27:42,007 --> 00:27:44,237
Well, technically,
your bare hands can kill somebody, too,

298
00:27:44,327 --> 00:27:47,000
They can be deadly weapons, too,
I mean, what if he knew karate, say?

299
00:27:47,087 --> 00:27:50,079
- You said he was a lollipop man,
- He was a lollipop man,

300
00:27:50,167 --> 00:27:52,237
Whas a lollipop man doing
knowing fucking karate?

301
00:27:52,327 --> 00:27:53,362
I'm just saying,

302
00:27:53,447 --> 00:27:55,881
- How old was he?
- About 50,

303
00:27:55,967 --> 00:27:58,276
Whas a 50-year-old lollipop man doing
knowing fucking karate?

304
00:27:58,367 --> 00:28:00,642
What was he, a Chinese lollipop man?

305
00:28:00,727 --> 00:28:03,685
Jesus, Ken, I'm trying to talk about,,,

306
00:28:11,727 --> 00:28:13,558
I know what you're trying to talk about,

307
00:28:13,647 --> 00:28:16,798
I killed a little boy,
You keep bringing up fucking lollipop men!

308
00:28:16,887 --> 00:28:20,516
- You didn't mean to kill a little boy,
- I know I didn't mean to,

309
00:28:22,447 --> 00:28:25,837
But because of the choices I made
and the course that I put into action,

310
00:28:25,927 --> 00:28:28,077
a little boy isn't here any more,

311
00:28:28,167 --> 00:28:30,283
And he'll never be here again,

312
00:28:34,727 --> 00:28:37,605
I mean here in the world,
not here in Belgium,

313
00:28:39,167 --> 00:28:40,725
Well, he'll never be here in Belgium, either,
will he?

314
00:28:40,807 --> 00:28:43,958
I mean, he might have wanted to come here
when he got older,

315
00:28:44,047 --> 00:28:45,605
I don't know why,

316
00:28:47,087 --> 00:28:49,203
And thas all because of me,

317
00:28:51,207 --> 00:28:53,243
He's dead because of me,

318
00:28:53,327 --> 00:28:54,806
And I'm trying to,,,

319
00:28:55,407 --> 00:28:58,444
I'm trying to get me head around it,
but I can't,

320
00:28:59,567 --> 00:29:02,286
I will always have killed that little boy,

321
00:29:04,127 --> 00:29:06,436
That ain't ever going away, Ever,

322
00:29:07,847 --> 00:29:09,041
Unless,,,

323
00:29:10,367 --> 00:29:11,880
Maybe I go away,

324
00:29:16,607 --> 00:29:18,598
Don't even think like that,

325
00:30:11,927 --> 00:30:13,360
You look good,

326
00:30:17,567 --> 00:30:19,444
Whas it matter anyway?

327
00:30:43,727 --> 00:30:48,084
- So, what do you do, Raymond?
- I shoot people for money,

328
00:30:50,847 --> 00:30:52,519
What kinds of people?

329
00:30:52,607 --> 00:30:55,724
Priests, Children, You know, the usual,

330
00:30:55,807 --> 00:30:57,763
Is there a lot of money
to be made in that line of business?

331
00:30:57,847 --> 00:30:59,758
There is in priests, There isn't in children,

332
00:30:59,847 --> 00:31:01,041
So what is it you do, Chloe?

333
00:31:01,127 --> 00:31:04,085
I sell cocaine and heroin
to Belgian film crews,

334
00:31:04,527 --> 00:31:05,676
Do you?

335
00:31:08,127 --> 00:31:09,845
Do I look like I do?

336
00:31:11,367 --> 00:31:12,925
You do, actually,

337
00:31:15,767 --> 00:31:18,565
Do I look like I shoot people?

338
00:31:19,767 --> 00:31:20,756
No,

339
00:31:22,607 --> 00:31:24,040
Just children,

340
00:31:31,287 --> 00:31:34,518
I saw your midget today,
Little prick didn't even say hello,

341
00:31:34,607 --> 00:31:36,359
Well, he's on a lot of ketamine,

342
00:31:36,447 --> 00:31:37,800
Whas that?

343
00:31:39,447 --> 00:31:40,800
Horse tranquiliser,

344
00:31:40,887 --> 00:31:42,400
A horse tranquiliser?

345
00:31:42,487 --> 00:31:44,842
- Where'd he get that?
- I sold it to him,

346
00:31:44,927 --> 00:31:47,885
You can't sell horse tranquilisers
to a midget!

347
00:31:50,927 --> 00:31:53,157
This movie,
I think is gonna be a very good one,

348
00:31:53,247 --> 00:31:55,556
There's never been a classic movie
made in Bruges until now,

349
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:57,160
Of course there hasn't, is a shithole,

350
00:31:57,247 --> 00:31:58,441
Bruges is my hometown, Ray,

351
00:31:58,527 --> 00:32:00,722
- Well, is still a shithole,
- Is not a shithole,

352
00:32:00,807 --> 00:32:03,241
What?
Even midgets have to take drugs to stick it,

353
00:32:03,327 --> 00:32:04,521
Okay,

354
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:09,960
So, you've insulted my hometown,

355
00:32:10,047 --> 00:32:12,322
You're doing very well, Raymond,

356
00:32:12,407 --> 00:32:14,716
Why don't you tell me some Belgian jokes
while you're at it?

357
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:16,320
I don't know any Belgian jokes,

358
00:32:16,407 --> 00:32:19,558
And if I did,
I think I'd have the good sense not to,,,

359
00:32:19,647 --> 00:32:23,925
Hey, hang on, Is Belgium where there were
all those child abuse murders lately?

360
00:32:24,007 --> 00:32:26,123
Then I do know a Belgian joke,

361
00:32:28,407 --> 00:32:30,363
Whas Belgium famous for?

362
00:32:30,767 --> 00:32:32,166
Chocolates and child abuse,

363
00:32:32,247 --> 00:32:35,683
And they only invented the chocolates
to get to the kids,

364
00:32:36,767 --> 00:32:37,961
What?

365
00:32:38,527 --> 00:32:41,678
One of the girls they murdered
was a friend of mine,

366
00:32:51,047 --> 00:32:52,639
I'm sorry, Chloe,

367
00:33:01,767 --> 00:33:04,679
One of the girls they murdered
wasn't a friend of mine,

368
00:33:04,767 --> 00:33:07,406
I just wanted to make you feel bad,

369
00:33:07,487 --> 00:33:09,682
And it worked, Quite well,

370
00:33:28,527 --> 00:33:30,245
Fucking unbelievable,

371
00:33:42,967 --> 00:33:44,685
Whas fucking unbelievable?

372
00:33:44,767 --> 00:33:46,519
Are you talking to me?

373
00:33:48,047 --> 00:33:51,119
He pauses,
even though he should just hit the cunt,

374
00:33:51,207 --> 00:33:52,526
And he repeats,

375
00:33:52,607 --> 00:33:56,805
Yes, I am talking to you,
Whas fucking unbelievable?

376
00:33:56,887 --> 00:33:59,082
Well, I'll tell you
whas fucking unbelievable, shall I?

377
00:33:59,167 --> 00:34:01,727
Blowing cigarette smoke
straight into myself and my girlfrienïs face,

378
00:34:01,807 --> 00:34:02,956
Thas fucking unbelievable!

379
00:34:03,047 --> 00:34:06,084
- This is the smoking section,
- I don't care if is the smoking section,

380
00:34:06,167 --> 00:34:08,397
All right?
She directed it right in my face, man,

381
00:34:08,487 --> 00:34:11,285
I don't wanna die
just because of your fucking arrogance,

382
00:34:11,367 --> 00:34:14,200
Isn't that what the Vietnamese used to say?

383
00:34:14,287 --> 00:34:17,324
Vietnamese?
What are you talking about, the Vietnamese?

384
00:34:17,407 --> 00:34:19,079
That statement
makes no fucking sense at all,

385
00:34:19,167 --> 00:34:20,919
Yes it does, The Vietnamese!

386
00:34:21,007 --> 00:34:23,567
Well, saying it over and over
ain't gonna make any more sense out of it,

387
00:34:23,647 --> 00:34:26,366
How does the Vietnamese
have any relevance whatsoever

388
00:34:26,447 --> 00:34:28,836
to myself and my girlfriend
having to breathe

389
00:34:28,927 --> 00:34:30,519
your frienïs cigarette smoke?

390
00:34:30,607 --> 00:34:32,563
Tell me how saying,,,

391
00:34:33,127 --> 00:34:36,085
Thas for John Lennon,
you Yankee fucking cunt!

392
00:34:36,527 --> 00:34:38,757
A bottle? No, don't bother,

393
00:34:52,487 --> 00:34:53,636
We're leaving,

394
00:34:53,807 --> 00:34:56,958
I don't hit women!
I would never hit a woman, Chloe!

395
00:34:57,847 --> 00:34:59,803
I'd hit a woman
who was trying to hit me with a bottle!

396
00:34:59,887 --> 00:35:02,481
Thas different, Thas self-defence, isn't it?

397
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:04,842
Or a woman who could do karate,

398
00:35:04,927 --> 00:35:08,476
I'd never hit a woman generally, Chloe,
Don't think that,

399
00:35:08,567 --> 00:35:10,205
God, you're pretty,

400
00:35:12,087 --> 00:35:14,555
- I have to make a call,
- Oh, no,

401
00:35:15,167 --> 00:35:19,524
You've gone off me, now, haven't you?
Just because I hit that fucking cow,

402
00:35:43,087 --> 00:35:45,806
- Hello?
- Where the fuck were you yesterday?

403
00:35:46,287 --> 00:35:49,324
We just popped out for some dinner, Harry,
We only popped out for half an hour,

404
00:35:49,407 --> 00:35:50,840
Yeah? Whad you have?

405
00:35:50,927 --> 00:35:52,645
- For dinner?
- Yeah,

406
00:35:52,727 --> 00:35:54,922
- Pizza, at Pizza Hut,
- Was it nice?

407
00:35:55,007 --> 00:35:58,283
Yeah, it was all right, I don't know,
It was Pizza Hut, The same as in England,

408
00:35:58,367 --> 00:36:01,962
Well, thas globalisation, isn't it?
Is Ray there with you?

409
00:36:02,607 --> 00:36:04,484
He's in the toilet,

410
00:36:04,567 --> 00:36:06,637
- Can he hear?
- No,

411
00:36:06,727 --> 00:36:08,365
Whas he doing?

412
00:36:08,447 --> 00:36:11,439
- What do you mean?
- Is he doing a wee or a poo?

413
00:36:11,527 --> 00:36:13,085
I don't know, Harry, the door's closed,

414
00:36:13,167 --> 00:36:17,399
Send him out on an errand for half an hour,
but don't make it sound suspicious,

415
00:36:22,047 --> 00:36:25,517
Ray? Why don't you go out
down to the pub for half an hour?

416
00:36:28,087 --> 00:36:32,524
Yeah, yeah, I know I said you couldn't,
but might as well enjoy ourselves, eh?

417
00:36:33,527 --> 00:36:37,566
No, I don't know if they've got
bowling anywhere, Could have a look,

418
00:36:38,647 --> 00:36:40,080
Yeah, see you,

419
00:36:50,767 --> 00:36:54,077
- Yeah, He's gone,
- Whad you say to him?

420
00:36:54,167 --> 00:36:56,601
I said, "Why don't you go have a drink,
you say you've been cooped up?"

421
00:36:56,687 --> 00:36:58,643
- What did he say?
- Said, yeah, he would,

422
00:36:58,727 --> 00:37:01,161
And he might go have a look
to see if there's a bowling alley around,

423
00:37:01,247 --> 00:37:04,603
- Was he just having a wee?
- Yeah, I think so, I assume so,

424
00:37:04,687 --> 00:37:07,247
- Sure he didn't mind?
- No, he was glad to get out,

425
00:37:07,327 --> 00:37:09,841
- He's definitely gone?
- Yeah, yeah, he slammed the door,

426
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:13,044
That don't mean he's gone,
Go check outside the door,

427
00:37:29,207 --> 00:37:30,959
Harry, he's definitely gone,

428
00:37:31,047 --> 00:37:33,163
You realise there are no
bowling alleys in Bruges?

429
00:37:33,247 --> 00:37:35,602
I realise that, Harry,
The boy wanted to have a look anyway,

430
00:37:35,687 --> 00:37:37,962
What are they gonna have,
a medieval fucking bowling alley?

431
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:40,197
As I say, I think he was just glad
to get out and about,

432
00:37:40,287 --> 00:37:43,165
So, is he having a nice time,
seeing all the canals and that?

433
00:37:43,247 --> 00:37:45,317
I had a lovely time when I was there,

434
00:37:45,407 --> 00:37:47,796
All the canals
and the old buildings and that,

435
00:37:47,887 --> 00:37:48,922
When were you here?

436
00:37:49,007 --> 00:37:52,682
When I was seven,
Last happy holiday I fucking had,

437
00:37:53,167 --> 00:37:55,681
- Have you been on a canal trip, yet?
- Yeah,

438
00:37:55,767 --> 00:37:57,837
Have you been down, like,
all the old cobbled streets and that?

439
00:37:57,927 --> 00:37:58,916
Yeah,

440
00:37:59,007 --> 00:38:01,123
- Is like a fairytale, isn't it, that place?
- Yeah,

441
00:38:01,207 --> 00:38:03,038
- With the churches and that, They're Gothic,
- Yeah,

442
00:38:03,127 --> 00:38:04,606
- Is it Gothic?
- Yeah,

443
00:38:04,687 --> 00:38:07,121
So he's having a really nice time?

444
00:38:07,207 --> 00:38:09,926
Well, I'm having a really nice time,

445
00:38:10,007 --> 00:38:12,646
I'm not sure if is really his cup of tea,

446
00:38:15,247 --> 00:38:16,362
What?

447
00:38:16,847 --> 00:38:18,758
You know, I'm not sure
if is really his thing,

448
00:38:18,847 --> 00:38:20,360
What do you mean,
"Is not really his thing"?

449
00:38:20,447 --> 00:38:22,483
Whas that supposed to mean,
"Is not really his thing"?

450
00:38:22,567 --> 00:38:24,876
- What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
- Nothing, Harry,

451
00:38:24,967 --> 00:38:26,958
Is a fairytale fucking town, isn't it?

452
00:38:27,047 --> 00:38:29,686
How can a fairytale town
not be somebody's fucking thing?

453
00:38:29,767 --> 00:38:32,759
How can all those canals and bridges
and cobbled streets and those churches,

454
00:38:32,847 --> 00:38:34,997
all that beautiful fucking fairytale stuff,

455
00:38:35,087 --> 00:38:36,884
how can that not be
somebody's fucking thing, eh?

456
00:38:36,967 --> 00:38:38,241
What I think I meant to say was,,,

457
00:38:38,327 --> 00:38:40,045
- Is the swan still there?
- Yeah, the swan's,,,

458
00:38:40,127 --> 00:38:43,085
How can fucking swans not fucking be
somebody's fucking thing, eh?

459
00:38:43,167 --> 00:38:45,397
- How can that be?
- What I think I meant to say was,

460
00:38:45,487 --> 00:38:48,524
when he first arrived,
he wasn't quite sure about it,

461
00:38:48,607 --> 00:38:52,395
You know, there's that big, dual carriageway
when you get off the train?

462
00:38:52,487 --> 00:38:54,637
It mightn't have been here
when you were here last, Harry,

463
00:38:54,727 --> 00:38:57,560
Well, as soon as he got into,
like, the old town proper,

464
00:38:57,647 --> 00:39:01,322
and he saw the canals and the bridges
and, you know, the swans and that,

465
00:39:01,407 --> 00:39:03,238
well, he just fucking loved it then,

466
00:39:03,327 --> 00:39:06,717
Couldn't get enough of it,
the medieval part of town,

467
00:39:06,807 --> 00:39:11,244
It was just that initial, dual carriageway
thing sort of put him off for a second,

468
00:39:11,327 --> 00:39:12,919
Don't know
if I remember a dual carriageway,

469
00:39:13,007 --> 00:39:14,281
Must be recent,

470
00:39:14,367 --> 00:39:18,838
- Hasn't spoilt it, has it?
- No, no, no, is just that initial thing,

471
00:39:21,207 --> 00:39:22,845
And you know what?

472
00:39:24,047 --> 00:39:26,083
As we were walking through the streets,

473
00:39:26,167 --> 00:39:31,082
there was this sort of freezing fog
hanging over everything,

474
00:39:31,527 --> 00:39:35,156
and it made it look almost like a fairytale
or something,

475
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:36,680
And he turned to me,
do you know what he said?

476
00:39:36,767 --> 00:39:38,280
Whad he say?

477
00:39:38,367 --> 00:39:43,157
He said, "Ken, I know I'm awake,
but I feel like I'm in a dream,"

478
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:46,557
- Yeah? He said that?
- Yeah,

479
00:39:46,647 --> 00:39:51,880
- Meaning, like, in a good dream?
- Yeah, Of course, like in a good dream,

480
00:39:51,967 --> 00:39:55,243
Oh, good, I'm glad he likes it there,

481
00:39:55,327 --> 00:39:57,158
I'm glad we were able
to give him something,

482
00:39:57,247 --> 00:40:00,922
Something good and happy,
Because he wasn't a bad kid, was he?

483
00:40:03,607 --> 00:40:05,882
He wasn't a bad kid, was he?

484
00:40:06,927 --> 00:40:09,839
Listen, take down this address,
Raamstraat 17,

485
00:40:09,927 --> 00:40:12,839
Thas "Raam," like "Ram,"
but with an extra "a,"

486
00:40:13,807 --> 00:40:16,446
- Raamstraat 17,
- You got that?

487
00:40:16,807 --> 00:40:18,160
Yes, Raamstraat 17,

488
00:40:18,247 --> 00:40:22,286
Good, There'll be a man there
tomorrow morning at 9,.00, his name's Yuri,

489
00:40:22,367 --> 00:40:24,005
- Yuri,
- He'll give you the gun,

490
00:40:24,087 --> 00:40:25,884
Ring me on the public phone
at Jimmy Driscoll's

491
00:40:25,967 --> 00:40:28,686
about 3,.00 or 4,.00 tomorrow, after is done,

492
00:40:29,607 --> 00:40:31,199
After whas done?

493
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:33,559
Are you being thick?

494
00:40:35,207 --> 00:40:36,845
- No,
- Listen, I like Ray,

495
00:40:36,927 --> 00:40:39,202
He was a good bloke,
but when it all comes down to it, you know,

496
00:40:39,287 --> 00:40:42,245
he blew the head off a little fucking kid,
And you brought him in, Ken,

497
00:40:42,327 --> 00:40:45,637
So if the buck don't stop with him,
where does it stop?

498
00:40:50,927 --> 00:40:51,916
Ken?

499
00:40:53,047 --> 00:40:55,322
If the buck don't stop with him,
where does it stop?

500
00:40:55,407 --> 00:40:57,318
It stops with me, Harry, Thas an easy one,

501
00:40:57,407 --> 00:40:59,398
Look, don't get shirty, Ken,

502
00:41:00,287 --> 00:41:04,997
Listen, I'm just glad that I was able
to do something for the boy before he went,

503
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:09,046
- Do what for the boy?
- You know, have him get to see Bruges,

504
00:41:09,847 --> 00:41:12,884
I'd like to go to see Bruges again
before I die,

505
00:41:13,647 --> 00:41:17,003
What was it he said again about,,,
Yeah, "Is like a dream,"

506
00:41:18,727 --> 00:41:21,844
"I know I'm awake,
but I feel like I'm in a dream,"

507
00:41:24,207 --> 00:41:25,276
Yeah,

508
00:41:27,087 --> 00:41:29,282
Give me a call when he's dead,

509
00:41:52,367 --> 00:41:56,883
- Thas my fucking girlfriend, you asshole,
- Eirik, what are you doing?

510
00:41:56,967 --> 00:42:00,118
- Where are you from, fucker?
- Ireland, originally,

511
00:42:00,887 --> 00:42:03,082
And you think is okay
to come over to Belgium

512
00:42:03,167 --> 00:42:04,839
and fuck another man's girl?

513
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:06,645
Look, I didn't know
she had a boyfriend, all right?

514
00:42:06,727 --> 00:42:09,560
And I haven't fucked her, anyway, Ask her,
I'd only put me hand on it,

515
00:42:09,647 --> 00:42:11,524
Eirik, put the gun down!

516
00:42:12,687 --> 00:42:14,996
Get down on your knees
and open your mouth,

517
00:42:15,087 --> 00:42:16,566
Don't start being silly,

518
00:42:16,647 --> 00:42:18,319
Get down on your,,,

519
00:42:19,207 --> 00:42:22,643
Exactly at what point was it
that all skinheads suddenly became poofs?

520
00:42:22,727 --> 00:42:23,842
Used to be, you were a skinhead,

521
00:42:23,927 --> 00:42:26,077
you just went around
beating up Pakistani 12-year-olds,

522
00:42:26,167 --> 00:42:29,318
Now it seems a prerequisite
to be a fucking bum-boy!

523
00:42:30,767 --> 00:42:34,646
- Thas not gonna help you, man,
- Ray, there's only blanks in that gun,

524
00:42:40,967 --> 00:42:42,685
Eirik, don't!

525
00:42:42,767 --> 00:42:46,203
- Now who's the fucking bum-boy?
- You, you fucking bum-boy!

526
00:42:48,287 --> 00:42:50,039
Chloe, what exactly is going on here?

527
00:42:50,127 --> 00:42:52,197
I can't see! I can't see!

528
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:56,485
Of course you can't fucking see!
I just shot a blank in your fucking eyes!

529
00:42:56,567 --> 00:43:01,277
- Is this fella your boyfriend?
- No, I mean, he used to be,

530
00:43:01,367 --> 00:43:05,804
- Well, whas he doing here?
- We,,, We rob tourists, sometimes,

531
00:43:05,887 --> 00:43:08,685
I fucking knew it was too good to be true!

532
00:43:09,047 --> 00:43:10,765
I knew you'd have never shagged me,
normally,

533
00:43:10,847 --> 00:43:12,963
No! Thas not true, I,,,

534
00:43:13,047 --> 00:43:16,244
I called it off tonight,
I told him not to come tonight,

535
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:19,080
- Why did you come tonight?
- Chloe, I can't see, I swear it!

536
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:23,126
Stop whingeing like a big gay baby,
I haven't had a shag in months!

537
00:43:23,207 --> 00:43:27,997
I can't see out of this eye, Chloe!
I have to go to the hospital!

538
00:43:28,087 --> 00:43:29,725
I'll drive you,

539
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:32,765
- Great! Now the whole nighs ruined!
- No!

540
00:43:32,847 --> 00:43:36,635
You can stay if you want,
I just don't know how long I'll be,

541
00:43:36,727 --> 00:43:39,446
I just knew someone like you
would never like someone like me,

542
00:43:39,527 --> 00:43:42,166
- I just knew,
- What do you mean, someone like me?

543
00:43:42,247 --> 00:43:44,124
You know, someone nice,

544
00:43:51,207 --> 00:43:53,596
Call me, Please,

545
00:43:58,647 --> 00:43:59,875
Chloe!

546
00:45:07,727 --> 00:45:11,083
- Have you got some sort of problem?
- No, no problem,

547
00:45:11,167 --> 00:45:13,806
Four beers in 20 minutes, No problem,

548
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:16,841
Fuck off,

549
00:45:24,647 --> 00:45:26,683
Beer and a red wine,

550
00:45:26,767 --> 00:45:28,166
I'll be back,

551
00:45:30,607 --> 00:45:32,359
How's the movie going?

552
00:45:32,447 --> 00:45:36,406
Is a jumped-up Eurotrash piece
of rip-off fucking bullshit,

553
00:45:36,487 --> 00:45:38,318
Like, in a bad way?

554
00:45:41,687 --> 00:45:43,325
Your girlfrienïs very pretty,

555
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:47,036
She ain't my girlfriend,
She's a prostitute I just picked up,

556
00:45:49,007 --> 00:45:51,396
Didn't know there were any prostitutes
in Bruges,

557
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:53,796
You just have to look in the right places,

558
00:45:53,887 --> 00:45:55,445
Brothels are good,

559
00:45:56,927 --> 00:45:59,805
Well, you've picked up
a very pretty prostitute,

560
00:45:59,887 --> 00:46:01,161
Thank you,

561
00:46:05,487 --> 00:46:07,159
You from the States?

562
00:46:07,967 --> 00:46:09,036
Yeah,

563
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:12,205
- But don't hold it against me,
- I'll try not to,

564
00:46:13,647 --> 00:46:16,559
Just try not to say anything too loud
or crass,

565
00:46:33,567 --> 00:46:35,842
Hey-ho, Drowning your sorrows, huh?

566
00:46:35,927 --> 00:46:39,476
- What sorrows?
- You know, being a sad, old, ugly little man,

567
00:46:39,567 --> 00:46:41,842
- One gay beer, please,
- How'd your date go?

568
00:46:41,927 --> 00:46:44,043
My date involved two instances
of extreme violence,

569
00:46:44,127 --> 00:46:46,083
One instance of her hand on my cock
and my finger up her thing,

570
00:46:46,167 --> 00:46:48,920
which lasted all too briefly,
Isn't that always the way?

571
00:46:49,007 --> 00:46:52,238
One instance of me stealing five grams
of her very-high-quality cocaine,

572
00:46:52,327 --> 00:46:54,397
and one instance of me blinding
a poofy little skinhead,

573
00:46:54,487 --> 00:46:57,524
So, all in all,
my evening pretty much balanced out fine,

574
00:46:57,607 --> 00:46:59,598
You got five grams of coke?

575
00:47:00,367 --> 00:47:01,959
I've got four grams on me
and one gram in me,

576
00:47:02,047 --> 00:47:03,275
which is why me heart
is going like the clappers,

577
00:47:03,367 --> 00:47:04,516
as if I'm about to have a heart attack,

578
00:47:04,607 --> 00:47:06,802
So if I collapse any minute now,
please remember to tell the doctors

579
00:47:06,887 --> 00:47:08,366
that it might have something
to do with the coke,

580
00:47:08,447 --> 00:47:09,800
Give us a gram, then,

581
00:47:09,887 --> 00:47:11,718
I thought you were laying off,
because it makes you depressed?

582
00:47:11,807 --> 00:47:15,083
You know what?
Right now, I don't really give a fuck,

583
00:47:42,127 --> 00:47:45,119
Why didn't you wave hello to me today
when I waved hello to you today?

584
00:47:45,207 --> 00:47:47,641
I was on a very strong
horse tranquiliser today,

585
00:47:47,727 --> 00:47:52,403
I wasn't waving hello to anybody,
except maybe to a horse,

586
00:47:52,847 --> 00:47:55,202
Huh? What are you talking about?

587
00:47:55,287 --> 00:47:57,243
Just horseshit,

588
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:59,879
You from America?

589
00:47:59,967 --> 00:48:02,401
Yeah, But don't hold it against me,

590
00:48:02,487 --> 00:48:05,285
Well, thas for me to decide, isn't it?

591
00:48:05,367 --> 00:48:08,245
- Are you from America, too?
- No, I'm from Amsterdam,

592
00:48:08,327 --> 00:48:09,646
Amsterdam,

593
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:12,446
Amsterdam is just a load
of bloody prostitutes, isn't it?

594
00:48:12,527 --> 00:48:14,438
Yes, Thas why I came to Bruges,

595
00:48:14,527 --> 00:48:17,644
I thought I'd get a better price
for my pussy here,

596
00:48:21,807 --> 00:48:23,399
You two are weird,

597
00:48:25,447 --> 00:48:27,483
Would you like some cocaine?

598
00:48:29,927 --> 00:48:32,600
I've also got some acid and some ecstasy,

599
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:45,396
Herve Villechaize, I know, did,

600
00:48:45,487 --> 00:48:48,126
The dwarf off, I think,
The Time Bandits, did,

601
00:48:49,327 --> 00:48:50,919
Lots of midgets,,,

602
00:48:51,447 --> 00:48:53,881
Dwarves, top themselves,

603
00:48:54,807 --> 00:48:56,126
Shitloads,

604
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:00,638
Would you ever think about it?

605
00:49:01,727 --> 00:49:04,958
Would you ever think about killing yourself
because you're a midget?

606
00:49:05,047 --> 00:49:09,518
- Fuck, man! What kind of question is that?
- We're just chatting, aren't we?

607
00:49:15,967 --> 00:49:18,925
See, Ken, this is the kind of hotel
Harry should have put us in,

608
00:49:19,007 --> 00:49:21,316
A five-star, with prostitutes in,

609
00:49:21,967 --> 00:49:26,404
You know, sometimes, I think Harry
doesn't even give a shit about us at all,

610
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:29,684
Has he still not called?

611
00:49:31,407 --> 00:49:34,604
- No, Still hasn't called,
- No news is good news, eh?

612
00:49:45,687 --> 00:49:46,961
Who's she?

613
00:49:48,767 --> 00:49:50,803
There's gonna be a war, man,

614
00:49:51,647 --> 00:49:52,921
I can see it,

615
00:49:53,007 --> 00:49:56,841
There's gonna be a war
between the blacks and between the whites,

616
00:49:56,927 --> 00:49:59,236
You ain't even gonna need
a uniform no more,

617
00:49:59,327 --> 00:50:01,887
This ain't gonna be a war
where you pick your side,

618
00:50:01,967 --> 00:50:03,320
Your side's already picked for you,

619
00:50:03,407 --> 00:50:06,285
And I know whose side I'm fighting on,
I'm fighting with the blacks,

620
00:50:06,367 --> 00:50:07,959
The whites are gonna get
their heads kicked in!

621
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:10,163
You don't decide this shit, man,

622
00:50:10,247 --> 00:50:12,044
Well, who are the half-castes
gonna fight with?

623
00:50:12,127 --> 00:50:14,687
The blacks, man, Thas obvious,

624
00:50:14,767 --> 00:50:17,076
But what about the Pakistanis?

625
00:50:18,127 --> 00:50:20,641
- The blacks,
- What about,,,

626
00:50:21,607 --> 00:50:23,086
Think of a hard one,

627
00:50:24,007 --> 00:50:27,443
- What about the Vietnamese?
- The blacks!

628
00:50:27,527 --> 00:50:31,884
Well, I'm definitely fighting with the blacks
if they've got the Vietnamese,

629
00:50:35,847 --> 00:50:37,166
So, hang on,

630
00:50:38,047 --> 00:50:39,719
Would all of the white midgets
in the world be fighting

631
00:50:39,807 --> 00:50:42,924
- against all the black midgets in the world?
- Yeah,

632
00:50:43,607 --> 00:50:45,643
That would make a good film!

633
00:50:46,487 --> 00:50:51,038
You don't know how much shit
I've had to take off of black midgets, man,

634
00:50:51,567 --> 00:50:52,795
Thas,,,

635
00:50:54,327 --> 00:50:55,999
Undeniably true,

636
00:50:56,087 --> 00:50:57,486
See, Jimmy,

637
00:50:58,927 --> 00:51:00,519
my wife was black,

638
00:51:02,047 --> 00:51:04,003
And I loved her very much,

639
00:51:05,047 --> 00:51:09,837
And in 1976,
she was murdered by a white man,

640
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:15,480
So, where the fuck am I supposed to stand
in all this blood and carnage?

641
00:51:17,007 --> 00:51:19,237
Did they get the guy who did it?

642
00:51:19,687 --> 00:51:22,759
- A friend of mine got him,
- Harry Waters got him,

643
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:28,877
So tell me, Jim, whose side do I fight on
in this wonderful war?

644
00:51:31,847 --> 00:51:34,759
I think you need
to weigh up all your options

645
00:51:35,847 --> 00:51:38,281
and let your conscience decide, Ken,

646
00:51:47,127 --> 00:51:51,086
Two manky hookers and a racist dwarf,

647
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:55,082
- I think I'm heading home,
- Yeah, I think I'll come with you,

648
00:51:56,847 --> 00:51:59,725
- Whas,,,
- Back off, shorty!

649
00:51:59,807 --> 00:52:01,763
You don't know karate,

650
00:52:01,847 --> 00:52:04,680
- Don't say you didn't have it coming,
- Don't say you didn't have it coming,

651
00:52:04,767 --> 00:52:05,995
Shortarse!

652
00:53:29,487 --> 00:53:31,762
- Meeting Yuri,
- Yes, I'm Yuri,

653
00:54:00,167 --> 00:54:02,806
Mr Waters said that might be necessary,

654
00:54:05,887 --> 00:54:09,197
There are a lot of alcoves
in the Koningin Astrid Park,

655
00:54:10,087 --> 00:54:12,203
You use this word, "alcoves"?

656
00:54:12,967 --> 00:54:15,117
"Alcoves"? Yes, Sometimes,

657
00:54:15,207 --> 00:54:19,166
There are not many people around
in these alcoves in Christmastime,

658
00:54:19,687 --> 00:54:22,884
If I were to murder a man,
I would murder him here,

659
00:54:25,527 --> 00:54:28,360
Are you sure
this is the right word, "alcoves"?

660
00:54:28,447 --> 00:54:31,917
"Alcoves," yes,
Is kind of like "nooks and crannies,"

661
00:54:32,007 --> 00:54:35,920
"Nooks and crannies," yes,
Perhaps this would be more accurate,

662
00:54:36,007 --> 00:54:39,283
"Nooks and crannies," rather than "alcoves,"
Yeah,

663
00:54:45,367 --> 00:54:49,599
You are going to do it, aren't you?
Mr Waters will be very disappointed,,,

664
00:54:49,687 --> 00:54:52,155
Of course I'm going to fucking do it,

665
00:54:53,647 --> 00:54:55,126
Is what I do,

666
00:55:01,167 --> 00:55:04,284
Your friend was behaving rather oddly
this morning,

667
00:55:11,487 --> 00:55:12,920
Oddly? How?

668
00:55:13,007 --> 00:55:16,966
Well, he asked me about the baby,
and if I wanted a boy or a girl,

669
00:55:17,767 --> 00:55:21,043
I said I didn't mind
as long as is healthy, of course,

670
00:55:21,127 --> 00:55:25,245
But then he gave me 200 euros
to give to the baby,

671
00:55:26,687 --> 00:55:31,397
I refused, obviously,
but he was quite insistent,

672
00:55:33,167 --> 00:55:36,125
Would you give it back to him
when you see him?

673
00:55:36,807 --> 00:55:40,686
I don't want to appear ungrateful,
but it seemed like all the money he had,

674
00:55:40,767 --> 00:55:44,601
- Do you know where he is now?
- He said he was going to the park,

675
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:43,046
Sorry, Ray,

676
00:56:44,887 --> 00:56:46,206
I'm sorry,

677
00:57:15,647 --> 00:57:16,762
Ray, don't!

678
00:57:16,847 --> 00:57:19,315
Fucking hell!
Where the fuck did you come from?

679
00:57:19,407 --> 00:57:22,285
I was behind the thing,
What the fuck are you doing, Ray?

680
00:57:22,367 --> 00:57:24,881
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Nothing,

681
00:57:27,007 --> 00:57:28,326
Oh, my God!

682
00:57:30,287 --> 00:57:32,755
- You were gonna kill me,
- No, I wasn't,

683
00:57:33,247 --> 00:57:35,317
You were gonna kill yourself!

684
00:57:37,927 --> 00:57:40,282
- I'm allowed to,
- No, you're not!

685
00:57:40,367 --> 00:57:41,402
What?

686
00:57:41,967 --> 00:57:44,765
I'm not allowed to and you are?
How's that fair?

687
00:57:51,647 --> 00:57:54,719
Can we go somewhere
and talk about this, please?

688
00:57:57,767 --> 00:57:59,883
I wasn't gonna go through with it, Ray,

689
00:57:59,967 --> 00:58:03,846
You fucking looked like
you were gonna go fucking through with it,

690
00:58:05,807 --> 00:58:09,038
- Where'd you get that gun?
- A friend of Harry's,

691
00:58:09,127 --> 00:58:10,401
Fuck, man,

692
00:58:12,927 --> 00:58:14,360
Let me see it,

693
00:58:18,207 --> 00:58:19,640
Silencer, too,

694
00:58:22,087 --> 00:58:23,122
Nice,

695
00:58:28,487 --> 00:58:30,682
Mine's a bloody girl's gun,

696
00:58:39,447 --> 00:58:41,836
- I'm keeping it,
- Pardon me?

697
00:58:44,007 --> 00:58:46,202
- Give me me gun back,
- You're not getting it back,

698
00:58:46,287 --> 00:58:47,356
You're a suicide case,

699
00:58:47,447 --> 00:58:50,041
And you were trying to shoot me
in the fucking head,

700
00:58:50,127 --> 00:58:51,606
You're not getting that gun back,

701
00:58:51,687 --> 00:58:54,406
A great day this has turned out to be,

702
00:58:54,487 --> 00:58:57,285
I'm suicidal, me mate tries to kill me,

703
00:58:57,407 --> 00:59:00,843
me gun gets nicked
and we're still in fucking Bruges,

704
00:59:02,087 --> 00:59:06,239
Listen, I'm gonna give you some money
and put you on a train somewhere,

705
00:59:06,327 --> 00:59:07,601
Back to England?

706
00:59:07,687 --> 00:59:10,599
You can't go back to England, Ray,
You'd be a dead man!

707
00:59:10,687 --> 00:59:14,282
I want to be a dead man,
Have you been missing something?

708
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:18,122
You don't want to be a dead man, Ray,

709
00:59:20,847 --> 00:59:22,644
I killed a little boy!

710
00:59:36,167 --> 00:59:38,283
Then save the next little boy,

711
00:59:39,687 --> 00:59:41,643
Just go away somewhere,

712
00:59:42,367 --> 00:59:45,643
get out of this business
and try to do something good,

713
00:59:46,727 --> 00:59:49,116
You're not gonna help anybody dead,

714
00:59:49,647 --> 00:59:52,161
You're not gonna bring that boy back,

715
00:59:54,167 --> 00:59:56,397
But you might save the next one,

716
00:59:57,847 --> 00:59:59,997
What am I gonna be, a doctor?

717
01:00:00,647 --> 01:00:02,160
You need exams,

718
01:00:02,927 --> 01:00:05,441
Do anything, Ray, Do anything,

719
01:00:21,327 --> 01:00:22,760
What a wanker!

720
01:00:24,687 --> 01:00:26,598
He said this whole trip,

721
01:00:28,607 --> 01:00:30,882
this whole being in Bruges thing,

722
01:00:31,647 --> 01:00:35,276
was just to give you
one last, joyful memory before you died,

723
01:00:36,687 --> 01:00:38,006
In Bruges?

724
01:00:43,487 --> 01:00:45,159
The Bahamas, maybe,

725
01:00:47,047 --> 01:00:48,685
Why fucking Bruges?

726
01:00:49,327 --> 01:00:51,204
I suppose is cheaper,

727
01:00:57,647 --> 01:01:00,115
The rest of the acid and the ecstasy,

728
01:01:01,167 --> 01:01:03,362
Can I have me gun back, please?

729
01:01:08,167 --> 01:01:10,044
What am I gonna do, Ken?

730
01:01:11,087 --> 01:01:13,647
- What am I gonna do?
- Just keep moving,

731
01:01:14,727 --> 01:01:16,558
Keep on moving,

732
01:01:16,647 --> 01:01:18,603
Try not to think about it,

733
01:01:19,847 --> 01:01:23,203
- Learn a new language, maybe?
- Sure, I can hardly do English,

734
01:01:23,287 --> 01:01:24,436
Thas one thing
I like about Europe, though,

735
01:01:24,527 --> 01:01:26,518
You don't have to learn
any of their languages,

736
01:01:26,607 --> 01:01:29,167
Just forget about home for a while,

737
01:01:29,247 --> 01:01:32,557
See how the land lies
in six years, seven years,

738
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:34,763
Seven years is not that long,

739
01:01:35,407 --> 01:01:37,398
Is longer than that boy got,

740
01:01:37,487 --> 01:01:39,876
Me first fucking job,

741
01:01:41,167 --> 01:01:43,397
Great hitman I turned out to be,

742
01:01:47,087 --> 01:01:49,885
Some people just aren't cut out for it, Ray,

743
01:01:50,487 --> 01:01:51,681
Are you?

744
01:01:57,687 --> 01:02:00,121
When are you going back to England?

745
01:02:00,847 --> 01:02:02,838
I'll head back in a couple of hours
or something,

746
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:06,397
Harry's not gonna be mad at you, is he?
For letting me go?

747
01:02:06,927 --> 01:02:07,996
I'll sort out Harry,

748
01:02:08,087 --> 01:02:11,124
Just tell him I'll have probably killed meself
in a fortnight, anyway,

749
01:02:11,207 --> 01:02:13,118
You won't, will you, Ray?

750
01:02:31,767 --> 01:02:34,076
Harry? Is Ken,

751
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:35,680
Listen to this noise,

752
01:02:37,967 --> 01:02:40,083
Do you know what that is?

753
01:02:40,167 --> 01:02:43,876
Yeah, I know you know is a train,
Do you know what train?

754
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:47,243
Well, is a train that Ray just got on,
and he's alive and he's well,

755
01:02:47,327 --> 01:02:49,602
and he doesn't know where he's going
and neither do I,

756
01:02:49,687 --> 01:02:52,360
So if you need to do your worst,
do your worst,

757
01:02:52,447 --> 01:02:55,564
You've got the address of the hotel,
I'll be here waiting,

758
01:02:55,647 --> 01:03:00,516
Because I've got to quite like Bruges, now,
Is like a fucking fairytale or something,

759
01:03:29,007 --> 01:03:30,122
Harry,

760
01:03:30,927 --> 01:03:32,042
Harry!

761
01:03:32,527 --> 01:03:35,644
- What?
- Is an inanimate fucking object,

762
01:03:35,727 --> 01:03:38,116
You're an inanimate fucking object!

763
01:03:47,887 --> 01:03:50,526
Now, you lot be good for your mummy
and lmamoto, okay?

764
01:03:50,607 --> 01:03:52,518
'Cause Daddy's got to
go away for a few days,

765
01:03:52,607 --> 01:03:55,121
- Where are you going?
- I've got to go to Bruges,

766
01:03:55,207 --> 01:03:57,846
- Bruges? Where's that?
- Is in Belgium,

767
01:03:59,127 --> 01:04:01,436
Why would anybody have to go to Belgium?

768
01:04:01,527 --> 01:04:04,087
'Cause I've got to sort something out,

769
01:04:04,167 --> 01:04:08,240
- Is it something to do with the phone?
- Is something to do with Ken,

770
01:04:09,927 --> 01:04:11,645
Is a matter of honour,

771
01:04:12,807 --> 01:04:15,446
Well, it ain't gonna be dangerous, is it?

772
01:04:18,247 --> 01:04:21,398
Well, of course is gonna be dangerous
if is a matter of fucking honour!

773
01:04:21,487 --> 01:04:22,920
You are bringing the fellas with you?

774
01:04:23,007 --> 01:04:25,726
Tell me you're bringing the fellas with you,

775
01:04:26,207 --> 01:04:27,435
Harry,

776
01:04:28,047 --> 01:04:30,766
I'm sorry for calling you
an inanimate object,

777
01:04:30,847 --> 01:04:32,166
I was upset,

778
01:06:07,927 --> 01:06:10,316
- You're Irish?
- Yes,

779
01:06:11,727 --> 01:06:13,319
What is your name?

780
01:06:15,447 --> 01:06:17,403
Derek Perlurrl,

781
01:06:21,087 --> 01:06:22,805
You hit the Canadian,

782
01:06:23,447 --> 01:06:25,199
You hit the Canadian,

783
01:06:25,287 --> 01:06:29,075
I "heet" the Canadian?
I don't know what you're talking about,

784
01:06:31,687 --> 01:06:34,121
Thas him! Thas the motherfucker,

785
01:06:40,127 --> 01:06:42,163
You hit the Canadian, yeah?

786
01:06:43,127 --> 01:06:45,197
Canadian? Shit,

787
01:06:51,487 --> 01:06:54,285
- We're taking you back to Bruges,
- Brilliant,

788
01:07:20,767 --> 01:07:21,961
Aye aye,

789
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:24,998
Take your pick, Mr Waters,

790
01:07:28,527 --> 01:07:30,040
An Uzi?

791
01:07:30,127 --> 01:07:32,846
I'm not from
South Central Los fucking Angeles,

792
01:07:32,927 --> 01:07:36,476
I didn't come here to shoot
20 black 10-year-olds in a fucking drive-by,

793
01:07:36,567 --> 01:07:39,161
I want a normal gun for a normal person,

794
01:07:50,287 --> 01:07:52,562
I knew he wouldn't kill the guy,

795
01:07:52,647 --> 01:07:56,606
I could see it in his eyes
when I was telling him about the alcoves,

796
01:07:57,767 --> 01:07:59,325
- About the what?
- The alcoves,

797
01:07:59,407 --> 01:08:02,046
The alcoves in the Koningin Astrid Park,

798
01:08:04,567 --> 01:08:06,683
Oh, I also have some dumdums,

799
01:08:06,767 --> 01:08:10,077
You use this word, "dumdums"?
The bullets that make the head explode?

800
01:08:10,167 --> 01:08:11,486
Dumdums, yeah,

801
01:08:11,567 --> 01:08:14,035
Would you like some of these dumdums?

802
01:08:14,527 --> 01:08:16,199
I know I shouldn't,

803
01:08:17,767 --> 01:08:19,086
but I will,

804
01:08:23,887 --> 01:08:25,286
Motherfucker,

805
01:08:26,447 --> 01:08:27,516
Is he talking to me?

806
01:08:27,607 --> 01:08:31,566
No, Eirik's on your side, Mr Waters,
Your young friend blinded him last night,

807
01:08:31,647 --> 01:08:32,716
Ray did?

808
01:08:32,807 --> 01:08:35,958
I was trying to rob him
and he took my gun from me,

809
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:41,126
And the gun was full of blanks,
and he shot the blank into my eye,

810
01:08:42,207 --> 01:08:46,564
And now, I cannot see from this eye
ever again, the doctors say,

811
01:08:47,247 --> 01:08:50,444
Well, to be honest,
it sounds like it was all your fault,

812
01:08:50,527 --> 01:08:51,562
What?

813
01:08:51,647 --> 01:08:54,241
I mean, basically, if you're robbing a man
and you're only carrying blanks,

814
01:08:54,327 --> 01:08:56,158
and you allow your gun to be taken off you,

815
01:08:56,247 --> 01:08:58,363
and you allow yourself
to be shot in the eye with a blank,

816
01:08:58,447 --> 01:09:01,883
for which I assume the person
has to get quite close to you, then,

817
01:09:01,967 --> 01:09:05,084
yeah, really, is all your fault
for being such a poof,

818
01:09:05,167 --> 01:09:07,965
So why don't you stop whingeing
and cheer the fuck up?

819
01:09:08,047 --> 01:09:10,481
Eirik, I really wouldn't respond,

820
01:09:17,327 --> 01:09:18,476
I thought you wanted the guy dead?

821
01:09:18,567 --> 01:09:20,603
I do want the guy dead,
I want him fucking crucified,

822
01:09:20,687 --> 01:09:25,522
But it don't change the fact that he stitched
you up like a blind, little gay boy, Does it?

823
01:09:26,727 --> 01:09:28,638
Thanks for the gun, Yuri,

824
01:10:32,927 --> 01:10:33,962
Well?

825
01:10:36,007 --> 01:10:37,884
The boy is suicidal, Harry,

826
01:10:37,967 --> 01:10:39,844
He's a walking dead man,

827
01:10:40,647 --> 01:10:42,558
Keeps going on about Hell and purgatory,,,

828
01:10:42,647 --> 01:10:44,956
When I phoned you yesterday, did I ask you,

829
01:10:45,047 --> 01:10:48,437
"Ken, will you do me a favour
and become Ray's psychiatrist, please?"

830
01:10:48,527 --> 01:10:52,805
No, What I think I asked you was, "Could
you go blow his fucking head off for me?"

831
01:10:52,887 --> 01:10:54,798
"He's suicidal"?

832
01:10:54,887 --> 01:10:58,243
I'm suicidal, You're suicidal,
Everybody's fucking suicidal!

833
01:10:58,327 --> 01:11:00,397
We don't all keep going on about it!

834
01:11:00,487 --> 01:11:04,639
Has he killed himself yet? No,
So he's not fucking suicidal, is he?

835
01:11:04,727 --> 01:11:07,036
He put a loaded gun to his head
this morning, I stopped him,

836
01:11:07,127 --> 01:11:09,516
He,,, What? This gets fucking worse!

837
01:11:10,407 --> 01:11:11,442
We were down in the park,,,

838
01:11:11,527 --> 01:11:15,315
Let me get this right,
You were down in the park?

839
01:11:15,407 --> 01:11:17,443
Whas that got to do with fucking anything?

840
01:11:17,527 --> 01:11:20,246
Let me get this right,
Not only have you refused to kill the boy,

841
01:11:20,327 --> 01:11:22,397
you've even stopped the boy
from killing himself,

842
01:11:22,487 --> 01:11:24,955
which would have solved my problem,
which would have solved your problem,

843
01:11:25,047 --> 01:11:26,878
which sounds like
it woulïve solved the boy's problem,

844
01:11:26,967 --> 01:11:28,480
It wouldn't have solved his problem,

845
01:11:28,567 --> 01:11:32,355
Ken, if I had killed a little kid,
accidentally or otherwise,

846
01:11:32,447 --> 01:11:33,596
I wouldn't have thought twice,

847
01:11:33,687 --> 01:11:36,121
I'd have killed myself on the fucking spot,
On the fucking spot,

848
01:11:36,207 --> 01:11:38,721
I'd have stuck the gun in me mouth
on the fucking spot!

849
01:11:38,807 --> 01:11:42,277
Thas you, Harry,
The boy has the capacity to change,

850
01:11:42,367 --> 01:11:44,722
The boy has the capacity
to do something decent with his life,

851
01:11:44,807 --> 01:11:48,083
Excuse me, Ken,
I have the capacity to change,

852
01:11:48,807 --> 01:11:52,243
Yeah, you do,
You've the capacity to get fucking worse!

853
01:11:52,807 --> 01:11:55,196
Yeah, now I'm getting down to it!

854
01:11:55,287 --> 01:11:57,118
Harry, les face it,

855
01:11:57,207 --> 01:11:59,767
And I'm not being funny,
I mean no disrespect,

856
01:11:59,847 --> 01:12:01,200
but you're a cunt,

857
01:12:01,287 --> 01:12:04,006
You're a cunt now,
you've always been a cunt,

858
01:12:04,087 --> 01:12:07,636
And the only thing thas gonna change is
you're gonna become an even bigger cunt,

859
01:12:07,727 --> 01:12:09,126
Maybe have some more cunt kids,

860
01:12:09,207 --> 01:12:11,198
Leave my kids fucking out of it,
What have they done?

861
01:12:11,287 --> 01:12:13,596
You fucking retract that bit
about my cunt fucking kids!

862
01:12:13,687 --> 01:12:15,837
I retract that bit
about your cunt fucking kids,

863
01:12:15,927 --> 01:12:19,476
Insulting my fucking kids!
Thas going overboard, mate!

864
01:12:19,567 --> 01:12:21,478
I retracted it, didn't I?

865
01:12:24,527 --> 01:12:28,042
- Still leaves you being a cunt,
- Yeah, I fucking got that,

866
01:12:45,847 --> 01:12:47,405
Where's Ray now?

867
01:12:48,687 --> 01:12:51,247
Oh, right about now, Ray is in one or other

868
01:12:51,327 --> 01:12:56,640
of the one million towns in mainland Europe
is possible to be in, other than here,

869
01:13:09,967 --> 01:13:12,322
I'll get all the money back to you
soon as I get through to me friend,

870
01:13:12,407 --> 01:13:13,920
Is not a problem, Raymond,

871
01:13:14,007 --> 01:13:16,521
And I'll get all your acid
and your ecstasy back to you, too,

872
01:13:16,607 --> 01:13:18,006
English humour!

873
01:13:18,167 --> 01:13:20,761
I'm assuming you've got your gun on you,

874
01:13:23,367 --> 01:13:26,916
- That Yuri bloke's a funny fella, isn't he?
- He does yoga,

875
01:13:28,207 --> 01:13:31,722
- "The alcoves,"
- Was he going on to you about the alcoves?

876
01:13:33,007 --> 01:13:35,726
"The alcoves in the Koningin Astrid Park,"

877
01:13:43,807 --> 01:13:47,163
Harry, I know you gotta do
what you gotta do,

878
01:13:47,247 --> 01:13:48,999
Is a bit crowded round here, you know?

879
01:13:49,087 --> 01:13:50,315
Well, I'm not gonna have a shootout

880
01:13:50,407 --> 01:13:53,285
in the middle of a thousand
fucking Belgians, am I?

881
01:13:54,847 --> 01:13:58,601
Not to mention the other nationalities,
just on their holidays,

882
01:13:59,967 --> 01:14:02,686
To see the swans and the Gothic
and all the fairytale stuff, eh?

883
01:14:02,767 --> 01:14:05,964
- Are you trying to fucking wind me up?
- No, Harry,

884
01:14:06,047 --> 01:14:08,356
On top of calling me a cunt
and calling me kids cunts,

885
01:14:08,447 --> 01:14:11,245
I might just have to
fucking shoot you right here,

886
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:12,521
Christ!

887
01:14:15,727 --> 01:14:17,683
Les go up the bell tower,

888
01:14:18,727 --> 01:14:20,843
Be quiet up there this time of evening,

889
01:14:20,927 --> 01:14:22,485
Les go up there,

890
01:14:40,527 --> 01:14:43,041
Yeah, Canadians,

891
01:14:43,847 --> 01:14:46,884
I feel a bit bad,
They didn't kill John Lennon, did they?

892
01:14:46,967 --> 01:14:49,322
Anyway, supposed to turn up
to court here in two days,

893
01:14:49,407 --> 01:14:51,398
- Are you going to turn up?
- Don't know,

894
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:53,637
What have I got to stay for really?

895
01:14:55,967 --> 01:14:58,481
The most beautiful woman

896
01:15:00,127 --> 01:15:01,685
you've ever seen

897
01:15:02,967 --> 01:15:05,003
in all of your stupid life,

898
01:15:15,127 --> 01:15:19,120
- The tower is closed this evening,
- No way, Is supposed to be open till 7:00,

899
01:15:19,207 --> 01:15:21,198
The tower is usually open until 7:00,

900
01:15:21,287 --> 01:15:23,926
Yesterday an American
had a heart attack up the tower,

901
01:15:24,007 --> 01:15:25,326
Today the tower is closed,

902
01:15:25,407 --> 01:15:29,195
Here, cranky, here's 100 for you,
We're only gonna be 20 minutes,

903
01:15:34,207 --> 01:15:40,077
The tower is closed this evening,

904
01:15:40,167 --> 01:15:42,362
Understand, Englishman?

905
01:16:20,087 --> 01:16:21,998
Jimmy, I've been wanting to say

906
01:16:22,087 --> 01:16:25,204
I'm really sorry for karate-chopping you
the other night,

907
01:16:25,287 --> 01:16:27,517
That was way out of order,

908
01:16:27,607 --> 01:16:32,044
You know, Ray, I'd find it easier to believe
and forgive you, somehow,

909
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:36,996
if the two of you weren't laughing
straight in my fucking face!

910
01:16:39,607 --> 01:16:41,837
Is for the goddamn movie, man,

911
01:16:45,327 --> 01:16:47,283
It is a nice town, Harry,

912
01:16:48,847 --> 01:16:50,758
I'm glad I got to see it,

913
01:16:54,807 --> 01:16:58,766
I didn't mean to be taking the piss out of it
being a fairytale place,

914
01:16:58,847 --> 01:17:00,565
It is a fairytale place,

915
01:17:01,287 --> 01:17:02,436
It really is,

916
01:17:03,127 --> 01:17:04,719
Is just a shame is in Belgium, really,

917
01:17:04,807 --> 01:17:08,038
But then you figure if it wasn't in Belgium,
if it was somewhere good,

918
01:17:08,127 --> 01:17:12,200
there'd be too many people coming to see it,
It would spoil the whole thing,

919
01:17:14,487 --> 01:17:16,637
Well, I'm glad I got to see it

920
01:17:18,407 --> 01:17:19,840
before I died,

921
01:17:26,687 --> 01:17:28,359
What are you doing?

922
01:17:28,847 --> 01:17:32,522
- What are you fucking doing?
- I'm not fighting any more, Harry,

923
01:17:33,407 --> 01:17:36,479
All right, then I'm blowing
your fucking head off,

924
01:17:38,287 --> 01:17:41,597
Don't come over all Gandhi,
What are you fucking doing?

925
01:17:43,527 --> 01:17:45,119
Ken, stop messing about, please,

926
01:17:45,207 --> 01:17:47,163
Pick up your gun,
I know I'm going to beat you anyway

927
01:17:47,247 --> 01:17:49,761
- 'cause you're a spaz, but,,,
- Harry,

928
01:17:51,247 --> 01:17:53,203
I'm totally in your debt,

929
01:17:56,007 --> 01:17:58,999
The things that have gone between us
in the past,

930
01:17:59,687 --> 01:18:01,405
I love you unreservedly for all that,

931
01:18:01,487 --> 01:18:02,602
What?

932
01:18:03,527 --> 01:18:05,199
For your integrity,

933
01:18:06,127 --> 01:18:07,606
For your honour,

934
01:18:08,487 --> 01:18:09,840
I love you,

935
01:18:12,167 --> 01:18:14,442
The boy had to be let go,

936
01:18:16,727 --> 01:18:19,036
The boy had to be given a chance,

937
01:18:19,527 --> 01:18:24,760
And if to do that, I had to say,
"Fuck you, and fuck what I owe you,

938
01:18:24,847 --> 01:18:29,363
"and fuck everything thas gone on
between us," then thas what I had to do,

939
01:18:29,847 --> 01:18:31,758
But I'm not fighting you,

940
01:18:33,207 --> 01:18:35,243
And I accept, totally,
everything you've got to do,

941
01:18:35,327 --> 01:18:37,045
I accept it, Totally,

942
01:18:40,767 --> 01:18:41,961
Oh, yeah?

943
01:18:44,167 --> 01:18:45,236
Yeah,

944
01:18:50,047 --> 01:18:54,484
Well, you say all that fucking stuff,
I can't fucking shoot you now, can I?

945
01:18:55,807 --> 01:18:58,196
Is entirely up to you, Harry,

946
01:18:58,287 --> 01:19:00,164
Is entirely your call,

947
01:19:01,687 --> 01:19:04,406
All I'm saying is I'm not fighting,

948
01:19:11,487 --> 01:19:13,045
Oh, you fucking cunt!

949
01:19:13,127 --> 01:19:14,276
Look, I'm not gonna do nothing to you

950
01:19:14,367 --> 01:19:17,996
just 'cause you're standing about
like Robert fucking Powell,

951
01:19:18,807 --> 01:19:20,445
- Like who?
- Like Robert fucking Powell

952
01:19:20,527 --> 01:19:22,245
out of Jesus of fucking Nazareth!

953
01:19:22,327 --> 01:19:23,396
My fucking leg!

954
01:19:23,967 --> 01:19:27,801
The psycho dwarf turns out
to just be a loveable little schoolboy,

955
01:19:27,887 --> 01:19:30,276
and is all some kind of
Boschian nightmare,

956
01:19:30,367 --> 01:19:31,800
Kiss my ass!

957
01:19:31,887 --> 01:19:35,846
I guess at least there weren't any
black people involved, eh, Jimmy?

958
01:19:37,087 --> 01:19:38,361
I wasn't,,,

959
01:19:39,167 --> 01:19:41,123
I wasn't talking about,,,

960
01:19:42,247 --> 01:19:45,159
There's gonna be a war
between all the blacks and all the whites,

961
01:19:45,247 --> 01:19:46,965
And all the black midgets
and all the white midgets,

962
01:19:47,047 --> 01:19:49,083
which would actually be really good,

963
01:19:49,167 --> 01:19:50,839
Thas just cocaine,

964
01:19:50,927 --> 01:19:53,236
He didn't even want
the Vietnamese on his side!

965
01:19:53,327 --> 01:19:55,363
Thas just cocaine,

966
01:19:56,287 --> 01:19:59,836
Listen, we're filming down
by the pointy building tonight,

967
01:19:59,927 --> 01:20:02,316
It might actually be good for once,

968
01:20:03,607 --> 01:20:05,598
You guys should come along,

969
01:20:05,687 --> 01:20:10,203
We,,, I think we're just gonna have
a quiet one tonight, Jimmy,

970
01:20:12,127 --> 01:20:13,719
Thas how it is!

971
01:20:15,647 --> 01:20:17,205
In another life,

972
01:20:23,727 --> 01:20:25,718
They're great, aren't they?

973
01:20:40,247 --> 01:20:42,681
You didn't, You didn't!

974
01:21:29,407 --> 01:21:31,796
Mr Waters? Mr Waters?

975
01:21:34,167 --> 01:21:36,556
- Who's that?
- Is Eirik,

976
01:21:37,967 --> 01:21:39,798
- The blind boy?
- Yeah,

977
01:21:40,167 --> 01:21:42,283
No, Yes,

978
01:21:43,247 --> 01:21:45,397
What do you fucking want?

979
01:21:45,487 --> 01:21:50,003
The guy you're looking for, the guy Ray,
he's downstairs at the bar,

980
01:22:24,807 --> 01:22:26,320
I'm sorry, Ken,

981
01:22:27,447 --> 01:22:30,837
But you can't kill a kid
and expect to get away with it,

982
01:22:32,727 --> 01:22:34,206
You just can't,

983
01:22:48,927 --> 01:22:51,441
- Where?
- To the left when you come out,

984
01:22:51,527 --> 01:22:53,245
The bar to the left,

985
01:26:02,367 --> 01:26:03,595
Ken!

986
01:26:06,167 --> 01:26:08,044
Ken! Ken!

987
01:26:09,967 --> 01:26:11,400
Harry's here,

988
01:26:13,527 --> 01:26:14,562
What?

989
01:26:15,967 --> 01:26:17,116
Take

990
01:26:18,727 --> 01:26:19,921
my gun,

991
01:26:32,767 --> 01:26:33,836
Ken?

992
01:26:34,927 --> 01:26:36,406
Where's my gun?

993
01:26:38,287 --> 01:26:39,800
Where's my gun?

994
01:26:42,647 --> 01:26:45,684
I'm gonna die now, I think,

995
01:26:47,607 --> 01:26:48,926
Oh, Ken!

996
01:26:50,807 --> 01:26:51,922
Jesus!

997
01:28:54,447 --> 01:28:57,120
- Mr Blakely said you had left,
- I need the key to the room right now,

998
01:28:57,207 --> 01:28:58,640
Quickly, now!

999
01:28:59,487 --> 01:29:01,603
And you gotta go home right now,
Is very, very dangerous here,

1000
01:29:01,687 --> 01:29:03,086
- All right? Go home! Right now!
- Okay,

1001
01:29:46,047 --> 01:29:50,040
No, I won't let you up there!
Put that gun away, right now!

1002
01:29:50,127 --> 01:29:51,719
Lady, get out of my fucking way, please,

1003
01:29:51,807 --> 01:29:54,765
No, I won't, I won't get out of your way,

1004
01:29:55,607 --> 01:29:57,040
You'll have to go through me,

1005
01:29:57,127 --> 01:29:59,766
Well, obviously, I'm not gonna through you,
am I, with a baby and that?

1006
01:29:59,847 --> 01:30:00,882
I'm a nice person,

1007
01:30:00,967 --> 01:30:03,959
But could you just get out
of the fucking way, please?

1008
01:30:08,687 --> 01:30:09,802
Marie!

1009
01:30:10,767 --> 01:30:12,997
Just let him come up, is okay,

1010
01:30:13,087 --> 01:30:16,204
Harry, swear not to start shooting
until she's left the hotel,

1011
01:30:16,287 --> 01:30:19,563
I swear not to start shooting
till she's left the hotel, I totally swear,

1012
01:30:19,647 --> 01:30:21,956
Well, I'm not going anywhere,

1013
01:30:22,047 --> 01:30:24,117
This is my hotel,

1014
01:30:24,207 --> 01:30:25,879
So you can fuck off!

1015
01:30:38,007 --> 01:30:40,760
- I suppose you've got a gun up there?
- Yeah,

1016
01:30:41,927 --> 01:30:44,521
Then what are we gonna do?
We can't stand here all night,

1017
01:30:44,607 --> 01:30:47,565
Why don't you both put your guns down
and go home?

1018
01:30:47,647 --> 01:30:50,559
Don't be stupid, This is the shootout,

1019
01:30:52,167 --> 01:30:55,125
- Harry, I've got an idea,
- What?

1020
01:30:55,207 --> 01:30:57,323
My room faces onto the canal, right?

1021
01:30:57,407 --> 01:31:00,001
I'm gonna go back to me room,
jump into the canal,

1022
01:31:00,087 --> 01:31:02,078
see if I can swim to the other side
and escape,

1023
01:31:02,167 --> 01:31:04,283
- Right,
- lf you go outside and round the corner,

1024
01:31:04,367 --> 01:31:06,483
you can shoot at me from there
and try and get me,

1025
01:31:06,567 --> 01:31:09,035
That way, we leave this lady and her baby
out of the whole, entire thing,

1026
01:31:09,127 --> 01:31:11,357
Do you completely promise
to jump into the canal?

1027
01:31:11,447 --> 01:31:13,165
I don't want to run out there,
come back in 10 minutes

1028
01:31:13,247 --> 01:31:14,726
and find you fucking hiding in a cupboard,

1029
01:31:14,807 --> 01:31:16,035
I completely promise, Harry,

1030
01:31:16,127 --> 01:31:18,322
I'm not gonna risk
having another little kid die, am I?

1031
01:31:18,407 --> 01:31:22,400
So, hang on, I go outside,
then I go which way, right or left?

1032
01:31:22,487 --> 01:31:23,886
You go right, don't you?

1033
01:31:23,967 --> 01:31:26,800
You can see it from the doorway!
Is a big fucking canal!

1034
01:31:26,887 --> 01:31:29,720
All right, Jesus!
I've only just got here, haven't I?

1035
01:31:29,807 --> 01:31:32,526
Okay,
On a count of "one, two, three, go," okay?

1036
01:31:32,607 --> 01:31:33,676
Okay,

1037
01:31:39,367 --> 01:31:42,006
- What? Who says it?
- Oh, you say it,

1038
01:31:42,087 --> 01:31:43,918
You guys are crazy,

1039
01:31:44,007 --> 01:31:45,326
- Are you ready?
- Ready,

1040
01:31:45,407 --> 01:31:46,886
- Set?
- Set,

1041
01:31:46,967 --> 01:31:48,685
One, two, three, go!

1042
01:32:02,167 --> 01:32:03,566
Keep driving!

1043
01:32:10,327 --> 01:32:12,602
No way, You're way too far away,

1044
01:34:10,287 --> 01:34:13,120
- The little boy,
- Thas right, Ray,

1045
01:34:14,207 --> 01:34:15,720
The little boy,

1046
01:35:21,927 --> 01:35:23,042
I see,

1047
01:35:29,447 --> 01:35:31,005
No, Harry,

1048
01:35:31,967 --> 01:35:33,446
He's not,,,

1049
01:35:35,967 --> 01:35:38,481
You've got to stick to your principles,

1050
01:36:03,807 --> 01:36:05,479
There's a Christmas tree
somewhere in London

1051
01:36:05,567 --> 01:36:09,276
with a bunch of presents underneath it
thall never be opened,

1052
01:36:09,927 --> 01:36:13,761
And I thought, "If I survive all this,
I'll go to that house,

1053
01:36:13,847 --> 01:36:15,519
"apologise to the mother there,

1054
01:36:15,607 --> 01:36:18,883
"and accept whatever punishment
she chose for me,"

1055
01:36:18,967 --> 01:36:22,164
Prison, death, it didn't matter,

1056
01:36:23,447 --> 01:36:26,598
Because at least in prison
and at least in death, you know,

1057
01:36:26,687 --> 01:36:28,962
I wouldn't be in fucking Bruges,

1058
01:36:31,327 --> 01:36:35,206
But then, like a flash, it came to me,
and I realised,

1059
01:36:37,447 --> 01:36:39,961
"Fuck, man, maybe thas what Hell is,

1060
01:36:41,487 --> 01:36:44,638
"The entire rest of eternity
spent in fucking Bruges!"

1061
01:36:49,327 --> 01:36:52,046
And I really, really hoped I wouldn't die,

1062
01:36:54,567 --> 01:36:57,035
I really, really hoped I wouldn't die,
