They're filming <i>midgets!</i>

146
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:50,868
Ray!

147
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:58,074
MAN: So, on <i>this scene,</i>
<i>you're</i> supposed to walk <i>like</i>
<i>a little,</i> tiny <i>mouse, yeah?</i>

148
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,355
Okay? <i>Great.</i>

149
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,924
Ray, <i>come</i> on, <i>let's</i> go.

150
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:10,826
My <i>arse, "Let's</i> go."
They're filming <i>midgets.</i>

151
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:15,462
Oh, my God!
Look <i>at that</i> girl.

152
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:17,058
<i>She's</i> gorgeous!

153
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:18,330
Ray, <i>we're</i> going
right now.

154
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,894
<i>Fuck</i> off, <i>are we!</i>

155
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:23,806
<i>This is the best</i> bit
of <i>Bruges so</i> far.
You and your <i>buildings.</i>

156
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:49,494
Hello.

157
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:54,832
Do you <i>speak</i> English?
No.

158
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:58,872
<i>Yes,</i> you do.
Everybody <i>does.</i>

159
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,572
<i>What are</i> you
filming <i>midgets</i> for?

160
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:05,014
<i>It's a Dutch movie.</i>
<i>It's a dream sequence.</i>

161
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:08,451
<i>It's a pastiche</i> of
<i>Nicholas Roeg's</i>
<i>Don't Look Now.</i>

162
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:10,489
Not <i>a pastiche,</i> but a...

163
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:15,084
A <i>"homage" is</i> too strong.
A "nod of <i>the</i> head"?

164
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:19,794
Wow, your <i>English</i>
<i>is</i> very good.

165
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:27,166
A lot of <i>midgets</i>
tend to kill <i>themselves.</i>

166
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:31,939
A disproportionate amount.

167
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:35,503
Hervé <i>Villechaize,</i>
off of <i>Fantasy Island.</i>

168
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,614
I think somebody
off <i>The Time Bandits.</i>

169
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:42,950
I suppose <i>they must</i>
<i>get</i> really <i>sad</i> about, <i>like,</i>

170
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,053
being really
<i>little</i> and that.

171
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,719
People looking <i>at them</i>
<i>and laughing at</i> them.

172
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:52,059
Calling <i>them names.</i>
You know, "shortarse."

173
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:57,792
<i>There's</i> another famous
<i>midget</i> I'm missing,
but I can't remember.

174
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:01,769
<i>It's</i> not <i>the</i> R2-D2 man.
No, <i>he's</i> still going.

175
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:07,772
I <i>hope</i> your <i>midget</i>
doesn't kill himself. Your
<i>dream sequence</i> will <i>be</i> fucked.

176
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,971
<i>He</i> doesn't <i>like</i>
being <i>called a midget.
<i>He prefers</i> "dwarf."

177
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,450
Well, <i>this is</i>
<i>exactly</i> my point!

178
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,647
People go around calling
you <i>a midget when</i> you
want to <i>be called a dwarf.

179
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:19,555
Of <i>course you're</i>
<i>gonna</i> blow your <i>head</i> off!

180
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:24,023
My <i>name's</i> Ray. <i>What's yours?</i>
<i>Chloe.</i>

181
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:28,193
How did you <i>get past</i>
<i>the</i> security man?

182
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:31,600
Getting <i>past</i> security men,
<i>it's</i> sort of my job.

183
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,637
<i>You're a shoplifter?

184
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,764
<i>(CHUCKLES)</i> No,
not <i>a shoplifter.

185
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,808
<i>It's a good joke,</i> though.

186
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:38,936
No.

187
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,510
I'll tell you <i>what</i> I <i>am</i>
<i>at dinner</i> tomorrow night.

188
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:43,980
(CHUCKLING)

189
00:14:58,731 --> 00:14:59,891
Fuck.

190
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,709
How fucking cool.

191
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,588
Mr. Blakely?

192
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:31,357
<i>Yes.</i> No, Mr. Cranham.
No. <i>Yes.</i> Mr. Blakely. <i>Yes.</i>

193
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,131
You <i>have a message.</i>

194
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:42,499
<i>Shit!

195
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:46,572
<i>HARRY: Number one,</i>
<i>why aren't you in when</i>
<i>I fucking told you to be in?</i>

196
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:49,773
<i>Number two, why doesn't</i>
<i>this hotel have phones</i>
<i>with fucking voicemail</i>

197
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:52,612
<i>and not I have to leave</i>
<i>messages with the</i>
<i>fucking receptionist?</i>

198
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:55,586
<i>Number three, you better</i>
<i>fucking be in tomorrow night</i>
<i>when I fucking call again</i>

199
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:59,784
<i>or there'll be fucking</i>
<i>Hell to pay, I'm fucking</i>
<i>telling you. Harry.</i>

200
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:25,610
(DOOR LOCK TURNING)

201
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:39,530
Would you turn
<i>the</i> fucking light off!

202
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:41,122
<i>Sorry, Ken.

203
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,327
<i>Keep the</i> fucking
<i>noise</i> down!

204
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,268
<i>Someone's</i> in <i>a mood.

205
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:03,813
(SOFTLY) You'll
<i>never guess</i> what.

206
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,982
Will you shut your
fucking mouth, <i>please,</i>
<i>and go to sleep?</i>

207
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:07,719
Oh, sorry.

208
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:15,223
<i>Except I've gotta take me</i>
<i>contact lenses</i> out.

209
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:23,808
Altogether,

210
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,343
I <i>had</i>

211
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:29,579
<i>five pints</i> of <i>beer</i>
<i>and six bottles.</i>

212
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:35,382
No. Six <i>pints</i> of <i>beer</i>
<i>and seven bottles.</i>

213
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:38,082
And you know what?
I'm not <i>even pissed!</i>

214
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:46,191
You'll <i>never guess</i> what, Ken.

215
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:49,993
Ken, you'll <i>never guess</i> what.
What?

216
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,195
Got <i>a date</i> for
tomorrow night.

217
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,362
I'm very happy for you.

218
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:53,564
With <i>a girl.

219
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:54,901
<i>Can</i> you turn
<i>the</i> light off, <i>please?</i>

220
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:57,874
Only <i>been</i> in <i>Bruges one</i> day,
got <i>a date</i> with <i>a girl
in <i>the</i> film <i>business,</i>

221
00:17:57,943 --> 00:18:00,002
<i>the</i> Belgian film <i>business.</i>

222
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,805
They're doing <i>a film
<i>about a midget.

223
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:23,293
<i>Miss?</i>

224
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:25,296
Marie?

225
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:32,977
<i>Sorry about the message</i>
<i>last</i> night. <i>The man</i> who
left it <i>is a bit of a...

226
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,437
Well, <i>he's a bit of a...

227
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:38,141
Cock?

228
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:41,343
<i>Yes. He's a bit of a cock.

229
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:45,851
Morning.

230
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,125
Harry <i>called last</i> night.

231
00:18:57,769 --> 00:18:59,293
<i>We missed</i> him.

232
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:04,575
<i>Jeez, he swears a lot,
doesn't <i>he?</i>

233
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:08,837
<i>We're</i> staying in tonight.
<i>Whatever</i> happens.

234
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:10,642
Hmm.

235
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,315
Except...

236
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:17,185
Hmm.
Hmm.

237
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:18,948
<i>Except</i> "hmm" what?

238
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:23,791
<i>Except</i> only <i>one</i> of <i>us</i>
<i>needs</i> to <i>stay</i> in, really.

239
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:25,090
Uh-huh.

240
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,327
And <i>which one</i> of <i>us</i>
would <i>that be,</i> now, Ray?

241
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:30,834
I thought you
didn't <i>like Bruges.</i>

242
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:32,700
I don't <i>like Bruges,</i>
<i>it's a shithole.

243
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:36,571
But I did already <i>say</i>
I <i>had a date</i> with
<i>a Belgian lady

244
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:40,703
in <i>the</i> Belgian film <i>business,</i>
<i>which</i> I did already
<i>say</i> about before.

245
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,914
<i>Just</i> don't <i>get</i> into
<i>any fucking trouble.</i>

246
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:50,113
<i>We're</i> keeping <i>a low profile.</i>

247
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:54,453
And <i>this</i> morning,
<i>and this</i> afternoon,

248
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,892
<i>we are</i> doing
<i>what</i> I want to do.

249
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:58,725
Got it?
Of course.

250
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:01,498
Which, I <i>presume,</i>
will <i>involve</i> culture.

251
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:05,298
Oh, <i>we</i> shall strike <i>a balance</i>
<i>between</i> culture and fun.

252
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:09,932
<i>Somehow</i> I believe, Ken,
<i>that the balance</i> shall tip
in <i>the</i> favor of culture.

253
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:14,811
<i>Like a big, fat,
fucking retarded,

00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,582
<i>a dwarf.

(DRAGGING FEET)

257
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:01,251
(SOFTLY) Ray, did <i>we</i>
or did <i>we</i> not <i>agree</i>

258
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:02,816
<i>that</i> if I <i>let</i> you
go on your <i>date</i> tonight,

259
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:04,862
we'd do <i>the things</i>
I wanted to do today?

260
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,795
<i>We are</i> doing <i>the things</i>
<i>that</i> you wanted to do today.

261
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:09,425
And <i>that</i> we'd do <i>them</i>
without you throwing
<i>a fucking moody,

262
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:11,867
<i>like some 5-year-</i> old
<i>who's dropped</i>
<i>all his sweets?</i>

263
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,905
I didn't <i>agree</i> to that.

264
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:16,867
I'll <i>cheer</i> up.
I'll <i>cheer</i> up.

265
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:20,245
Up <i>there,</i>
<i>the</i> top altar,
<i>is a phial</i>

266
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:24,505
brought <i>back</i> by
<i>a Flemish knight from the</i>
<i>Crusades</i> in <i>the</i> Holy Land.

267
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:27,177
And <i>that</i> phial,
do you know <i>what</i>
<i>it's said</i> to contain?

268
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:28,810
No, <i>what's</i> it
<i>said</i> to contain?

269
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:32,846
<i>It's said</i> to contain
<i>some drops</i> of
<i>Jesus Christ's</i> blood.

270
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:36,655
<i>Yeah, that's</i> how

<i>Yeah. Yeah.</i>

272
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:41,030
And <i>this</i> blood, right,
though <i>it's dried</i> blood,

273
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:45,194
<i>at different times</i>
<i>over</i> many <i>years, they say</i>
it <i>turned back</i> into liquid.

274
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,932

Huh?

<i>you're a midget?

00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:40,656
No. Still hasn't called.

<i>The blacks,</i> man.
<i>That's obvious.</i>

<i>The blacks.</i>
<i>What</i> about...

733
00:52:31,348 --> 00:52:32,872

<i>The blacks!</i>

736

<i>So, hang on.

my <i>wife was black.</i>

747
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:15,548
And I <i>loved her</i> very much.

748

<i>she was murdered</i>

<i>am I supposed to stand
in all <i>this</i> blood and <i>carnage?</i>

750

Did <i>they get</i>
<i>the</i> guy who did it?

<i>whose side</i> do I fight
on in <i>this</i> wonderful war?

754
00:53:44,588 --> 00:53:47,648
I think you <i>need</i> to

00:53:48,758 --> 00:53:51,283
<i>and let</i> your
<i>conscience decide,</i> Ken.

<i>and a racist</i> dwarf.

00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:06,335
I think I'm heading <i>home.</i>

758
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:08,843
<i>Yeah.</i> I think
I'll <i>come</i> with you.

00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:13,672
What's...
<i>Back</i> off, shorty!

760
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,650
You don't know <i>karate.</i>

761
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:16,708
Don't <i>say</i> you didn't
<i>have</i> it coming.

762
00:54:16,786 --> 00:54:18,583
Don't <i>say</i> you didn't
<i>have</i> it coming.

00:54:18,888 --> 00:54:20,219
<i>Shortarse!</i>

765
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:49,603
<i>Yes,</i> I'm Yuri.

766
00:56:19,242 --> 00:56:21,972
Mr. <i>Waters said</i>
<i>that</i> might <i>be necessary.</i>

767
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:28,673
<i>There are a lot of alcoves</i>
in <i>the</i> Koningin Astrid Park.

768
00:56:29,586 --> 00:56:31,781
You <i>use this</i> word,
"alcoves"?

769
00:56:32,589 --> 00:56:34,819
"Alcoves"? <i>Yes.</i> Sometimes.

770
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:39,055
<i>There are</i> not many
people around in <i>these</i>
<i>alcoves</i> in Christmastime.

771
00:56:39,596 --> 00:56:42,929
If I <i>were</i> to <i>murder a man,
I would <i>murder</i> him <i>here.</i>

772
00:56:45,702 --> 00:56:48,637
<i>Are</i> you <i>sure this is</i>
<i>the</i> right word, "alcoves"?

773
00:56:48,705 --> 00:56:52,368
"Alcoves," <i>yes.</i>
<i>It's</i> kind of <i>like</i>
<i>"nooks</i> and crannies."

774
00:56:52,442 --> 00:56:56,538
<i>"Nooks</i> and crannies," <i>yes.</i>
<i>Perhaps this</i> would <i>be</i>
<i>more accurate.</i>

775
00:56:56,613 --> 00:57:00,014
<i>"Nooks</i> and crannies,"
rather <i>than</i> "alcoves." <i>Yeah.</i>

776
00:57:06,356 --> 00:57:10,793
You <i>are</i> going to do it,
<i>aren't</i> you? Mr. <i>Waters</i>
will <i>be</i> very disappointed...

777
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:13,454
Of <i>course</i> I'm going to
fucking do it.

778
00:57:14,998 --> 00:57:16,556
<i>It's what</i> I do.

779
00:57:22,839 --> 00:57:26,104
Your friend <i>was</i> behaving
rather oddly <i>this</i> morning.

780
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:35,107
Oddly? How?

781
00:57:35,185 --> 00:57:39,315
Well, <i>he asked me</i>
<i>about the</i> baby, and if
I wanted <i>a boy or a girl.

782
00:57:40,156 --> 00:57:43,557
I <i>said</i> I didn't mind
<i>as</i> long <i>as it's</i>
healthy, of course.

783
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:47,960
But <i>then he gave me</i> 200 euros
to <i>give</i> to <i>the</i> baby.

784
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:54,369
I refused, obviously,
but <i>he was quite</i> insistent.

785
00:57:56,206 --> 00:57:59,266
Would you <i>give</i> it
<i>back</i> to him <i>when</i>
you <i>see</i> him?

786
00:58:00,009 --> 00:58:04,036
I don't want to <i>appear</i>
ungrateful, but it <i>seemed</i>
<i>like</i> all <i>the money he</i> had.

787
00:58:04,113 --> 00:58:08,106
Do you know <i>where he is</i> now?
<i>He said he was</i>
going to <i>the</i> park.

788
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:09,075
<i>Sorry, Ray.

789

794
00:59:51,621 --> 00:59:52,679

<i>How's that</i> fair?

803

<i>Can we</i> go somewhere
<i>and talk about this, please?</i>

804
