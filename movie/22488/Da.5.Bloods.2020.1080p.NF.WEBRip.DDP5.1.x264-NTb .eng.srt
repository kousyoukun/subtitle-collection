19
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,810
My conscience won't let me go shoot my brother

20
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,360
or some darker people

22
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,310
or some poor, hungry people in the mud

23
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:17,480
for big, powerful America, and shoot them for what?

24
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,190
They never called me "nigger." They never lynched me.

25
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,560
They didn't put no dogs on me.

26
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,550
They didn't rob me of my nationality.

27
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:51,550
That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.

30
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,060
When you take 20 million black people

32
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,690
and make them fight all your wars

33
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,020
and pick all your cotton and you never

34
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,310
give them any real recompense,

37
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:04,770
sooner or later their allegiance towards you

38
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:06,250
is going to wear thin.

42
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,960
America has declared war on black people.

44
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:26,350
If the link-up is not made

46
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:29,640
between what's happening in Vietnam and here,

49
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:31,950
we may very well face a period

51
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,500
of full-blown fascism very soon.

65
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,980
I shall not seek and I will not accept

68
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:59,050
the nomination of my party for another term as your president.

72
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,840
America needs a full-time president

73
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:12,750
and a full-time Congress.

75
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:16,020
I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow.

77
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,850
In the Civil War, 186,000

78
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:20,020
black men fought in the military service,

79
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,140
and we were promised freedom and we didn't get it.

80
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,190
In World War II, 850,000 black men fought,

82
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,940
and we were promised freedom, and we didn't get it.

83
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,520
Now here we go with the damn Vietnam War,

85
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,940
and we still ain't gettin' nothin'

86
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,420
but racist police brutality, et cetera.

93
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:59,090
God damn!

94
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,750
My man!

95
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,920
- What's going on, man? - How you doing, man?

96
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,310
Oh, my goodness. So good to see you.

97
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,210
- You, too, Blood! - Look at you!

98
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,980
God damn, Eddie, you still pigeon-toed?

99
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,270
You didn't get that shit fixed?

100
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,540
Well, I decided not to. Why, brother?

101
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,920
The women love it.

102
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:22,100
Besides, did you know that Jackie Robinson, John Elway,

103
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,250
Agassi, Messi, Neymar, Mookie

104
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,980
and MJ are all pigeon-toed?

105
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,890
And you, shit. Let me give you some power.

106
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,840
- Let me see if I can remember this. - Come on, you got it.

107
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:35,960
- Okay, all right. Here we go. - Give me some of that black shit.

108
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,000
Get in here. Finally!

109
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:43,710
Finally!

110
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:44,560
Yeah, man. Look at you.

111
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,050
- How you doing? - I'm all right. I'm all right.

112
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,840
Bring it here! There he is.

113
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:50,960
How we feelin'?

114
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,520
Hold on. Finally. Finally.

115
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,300
Now, look at you.

116
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,060
- It sure is good to see y'all. - Ain't this some shit?

117
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:05,270
I'm tellin', it's a stone cold trip being back here in country.

118
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,850
Baby, we got off that plane,

119
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,310
that heat hit me upside the head, ski-bop!

120
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,640
Just like in '68.

121
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:14,640
- Yeah, brother man, we are back. - The Bloods is back.

122
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:18,730
- 5 Bloods don't die, we just multiply! - Yeah, yeah!

123
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,420
Soon to be five.

124
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,000
- Amen. - Amen.

125
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,090
Look what I found.

127
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,390
Young Blood.

128
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,440
- Get you home, Blood. - Damn.

129
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,980
Brother man in all his glory.

130
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,840
- Amen. - Let me see it, man.

131
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,520
- Uh, ma'am? - Yes, sir.

132
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,440
Can you please make sure that all four rooms are on my card?

133
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,390
No, no, thank you. I'm good. I'm good.

134
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,560
- Hey, on me, remember? - Nah, nah, I got mine.

135
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,890
I ain't your welfare charity case.

136
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,190
Ain't nobody saying no shit like that.

137
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:01,690
Everybody know your black ass and that big black Amex card,

138
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:05,020
the biggest fucking car dealership in the world, right?

139
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,750
Keep your money, man.

140
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,520
I see your head still hard as hell.

141
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,460
Just like my Swanson Johnson.

142
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,420
Man, you crazy as hell, bruh.

145
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,350
Hey, y'all know I got an 18-year-old son?

146
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,350
What, he's 18 now?

147
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,750
Yeah, check this out.

148
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,850
Look at that handsome dude, man.

149
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:27,730
Yeah.

150
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,550
Must take after his mama.

151
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,850
I got thug-ass hardheads moving into my hood.

152
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,770
Now Cissy wants to move out.

153
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,690
You got a piece for protection?

154
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:41,350
Yeah, I got a piece for protection. Got a side piece.

156
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:44,460
I got Smith on one side and c on the other.

157
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:53,770
- Money, please. - No. You gotta go. You gotta go, son.

158
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:55,130
I'm good. Man.

159
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,690
- GI, GI. - They don't have no age limit in a bar in Vietnam.

160
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:02,130
No, no, you gotta... Come on, get him the fuck out of here.

161
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:07,210
Money, money. GI.

162
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,730
- There you go, all right. - Twenty bucks.

163
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:10,550
Go.

164
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,690
Now he got more in his damn cup than I got in my wallet.

165
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,590
- Man, they'll take you. - Shit.

166
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,130
It's a damn shame.

167
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,300
On the real, man.

168
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,560
We got back from Nam, we didn't get nothing but a hard damn time.

169
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,640
- Folks called us baby killers. - Yeah.

170
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,560
See, I bought into all that bullshit.

171
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,840
How did your life change? Yeah, right.

172
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,770
Time we got these free-loading immigrants

173
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:38,880
off our backs and build that wall.

174
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:42,520
Negroes better wake the fuck up with the quickness, man.

175
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,230
- No, no, no, no, no! - I'm just saying. I'm--

176
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:48,980
Don't tell me that you voted for President Fake Bone Spurs.

178
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,640
- Yeah, I voted for him. - Get the fuck out of here.

179
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:52,890
He didn't vote for him.

180
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,640
- I thought that was you. - Impeach him.

181
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:57,740
That grinnin'-ass Negro on the front row.

182
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,770
Right there behind Trump at that rally.

183
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,420
"Ha! Ha! It's me! It's me!"

187
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,940
Blacks for Trump, you watch.

188
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:11,650
You watch. Those signs are great, thank you.

189
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,670
Fake news.

190
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,940
See? That's what they all go to.

191
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,060
- Fake news. - Always go to that one.

192
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,350
Yeah. I'm tired of not getting mine, man.

193
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,210
I feel you. I feel you.

194
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:26,060
Been fucked my whole goddamn life, bruh. Goin' for me!

195
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,500
- Shit. - For real.

196
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,210
I mean, back in the day,

197
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,810
- being a brother meant something. - Yeah, man.

198
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:34,310
We fought against the man.

199
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:36,100
- We loved one another. - Amen.

200
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,060
We became ace boon coon blood brothers

201
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,270
out there in that damn jungle.

202
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:39,980
- Preach on it. - Yeah.

203
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:42,350
- Stormin' Norm demanded it. - He did.

204
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,600
- Sure did. - All right, come on.

205
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,690
Yeah. Here we go. Boom!

206
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:47,090
Boom! All right, yeah.

207
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,960
- Otis. - Vinh.

208
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,420
- This is our guide, Vinh. - Hey, I'm Eddie.

209
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:02,250
- Vinh. - I'm Melvin, man.

210
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,560
- Nice to meet you. - How you doing?

211
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,090
- Good. - Paul, man.

212
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,350
- Good to meet you. - Yeah.

213
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:09,670
Gentlemen, welcome back to Vietnam.

214
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,550
- Thank you. - Thank you, man.

215
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:18,310
- I have itinerary for you. - That's for you.

216
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:19,550
- For you. - Thank you.

217
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,460
- For you. - Pull up a seat.

218
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,980
I still think hiking into the jungle

219
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,890
without me as your guide is a big mistake.

220
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,560
- We know that jungle, man. - Yes, we sure do.

221
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,750
Oh, yeah.

222
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:35,730
Do you have the necessary documents?

223
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:37,170
Yes, there you go.

224
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,460
From the Pentagon... and from the Vietnamese government.

225
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,810
When we locate Norman's remains,

226
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,920
the DPAA is gonna send in a recovery team

227
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,140
to bring him back home.

228
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,090
Arlington National Cemetery.

229
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,810
Hey, man, what the... what the fuck are they staring at, man?

230
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:58,670
Who?

231
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,550
Those two right there.

232
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,810
Shit. Those two over there,

233
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,960
they've been staring at us for the last ten minutes.

234
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,710
- Just chill, man. Just chill. - Chill? People staring at me, man.

235
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,440
Staring at all of us.

236
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,940
Those gentlemen just buy you this drink.

237
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,190
They are former Viet Cong

238
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:18,750
and wanna welcome you all back to their country.

239
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:19,750
Yeah?

240
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,710
- One of them is my cousin, Nguyen. - Get outta here.

241
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,840
And my father's younger brother.

242
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:30,050
- But you're from the south. - They fought for the north.

243
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,130
Nguyen does tours for North Vietnamese tourists.

244
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,940
The American War turned Vietnamese family

245
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,630
against Vietnamese family.

246
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,340
- Paul. - Hey, man.

247
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,770
Those could've been the dudes

248
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:49,020
that zapped Norm, that's all I'm saying.

249
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,140
Will you raise your goddamn glass?

250
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,590
The American War is over. Come on.

251
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,500
Come on, man.

253
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,420
Good night.

254
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:17,190
- Feelin' the love. - Look at him.

255
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:18,750
- I tell ya. - I know.

256
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,300
GI! GI!

257
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,800
Now I know why this mission was so damn important.

258
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,050
It's about what this war is all about.

259
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,460
There it is.

260
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:40,880
All right, Bloods. Our objective is in the C-47.

261
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,920
Hold yourself! Hold on!

262
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,710
- Come on. - Hold on!

263
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,020
- Lock it up! - Cover the Bloods to the plane!

264
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:02,750
- Go! Go, man! You got it! - Harlow and Cots, KIA!

265
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,670
Lay down cover fire!

266
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:23,550
Go!

267
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,500
Reloading.

268
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,000
- Reload! - Reloading.

269
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,250
Move out! Move out!

270
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,800
Fuck! Jammed!

271
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,670
Come on! Go!

272
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,460
Move, move, move!

273
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,590
Go, go, go!

274
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,420
Go!

275
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,630
Man down! Man down!

276
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,590
Check fire. Paul! Get up! Get up!

277
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,550
Team one, take security!

278
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,670
Set security!

279
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,340
Set security!

280
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,590
Hey, Paul, come inside!

281
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:39,880
Clear!

282
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,050
Bloods!

283
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,670
Yo, come on in here.

284
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,460
All right. Let's see what we got here.

285
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,480
- Out of sight! - Great googly-moogly.

286
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,500
You know what this means?

287
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,130
We gold standard.

288
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,300
We gold standard.

289
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,670
I've run many tours for GIs from the American War.

290
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,630
Glad you can now see our country in a different light.

291
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,770
Will you look at this?

292
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:40,340
- It's a whole different place. - I can't believe it.

293
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:43,350
They didn't need us. They should've just sent Mickey D's,

294
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,690
Pizza Hut and The Colonel,

295
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:47,060
and we would have defeated the V.C. in one week.

296
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,710
- You got it. - Finger-lickin' good.

297
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,500
Paul, when did you serve?

298
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,500
I did three tours, man. '67 to '71.

299
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,800
1st Infantry.

300
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:02,140
Were you involved in Operation Junction City?

301
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:03,560
We were there. We were all there.

302
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,050
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

303
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,340
My father was there, too.

304
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,130
- Yeah? - 25th Infantry, ARVN.

305
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:14,050
He fought to the very last man.

306
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:17,130
My brother, give it to me. Give it to me.

307
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,590
My family was here in Saigon when it fell.

308
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:26,000
My dad spent 18 months in a communist re-education camp.

309
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:29,050
Many other were not so lucky.

310
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:33,940
Hey, y'all remember those fugazi Rambo movies?

311
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,060
- Sly. - Yeah.

312
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,710
I like them shits, man.

313
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:38,640
You gotta be fucking kidding me, man.

314
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:42,600
Him and that... that dude, uh, Walker, Texas Ranger.

315
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,440
- I ain't saying nothing about him. - Man!

316
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,940
Out there trying to save some imaginary POWs.

317
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,770
All them Holly-weird motherfuckers

318
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:52,060
trying to go back and win the Vietnam War.

319
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,600
Yeah. I would be the first cat in line

320
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,850
if there was a flick about a real hero,

321
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:00,060
you know, one of our blood. Somebody like Milton Olive.

323
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:03,310
That man jumped on that grenade and saved his Bloods' lives.

324
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,140
And he was the first brother

325
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,350
to be awarded the Medal of Honor in Nam.

326
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,890
Eighteen years old.

327
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,890
Look, I love y'all and all that bullshit,

328
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,250
but, uh, I ain't doin' that.

329
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,690
Man, nobody want you to die for them.

330
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:16,920
'Cause I ain't.

331
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:19,850
Like Aretha sang, "You better think."

332
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:21,940
- Oh, Vinh. - What the fuck he talkin' about?

333
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:25,640
Listen, Bloods, I'm out, all right? Thank you very much.

334
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:26,880
- Thank you. - All right.

335
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:29,800
Be careful, man.

336
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,710
I'll be careful. Later.

337
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:34,090
Where's he going?

338
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,880
He got something to take care of, man.

340
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,000
Tien...

341
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,020
you have hardly changed.

342
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,000
We both know that's not true.

343
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,800
But thank you for being so kind.

344
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:14,340
You look like you've done well for yourself.

345
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,090
We find a way.

346
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,920
- Yes, we do. When we can. - Yes.

349
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:31,630
The gold is belong to Vietnamese government.

350
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:35,460
Monsieur Desroche converts the gold into cash.

351
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:37,730
He's the only person that I know

352
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:40,840
who can handle a transaction of this size.

353
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,300
- Have you dealt with him before? - Yes.

354
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:49,250
He's expensive. 20%.

355
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,390
And I will need 10%.

356
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,960
And there's no other way to move this?

357
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,440
International export is my business.

358
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,880
- It's why you call me. - Yeah.

362
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:16,380
This is my daughter, Michon.

363
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:23,710
And this is my old friend Otis. From American War.

364
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:26,460
- It's, uh... - Hello, Otis.

365
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,590
It's very nice to meet you.

367
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,460
Thanks, my dear.

368
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,130
Is, uh...

369
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:25,460
Is, uh... Is that our daughter? Our...

370
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:28,380
Yes, she is.

371
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:34,800
She was a bastard child of the enemy.

372
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:38,170
I was a whore.

373
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:42,840
Her father was a moi, the nigger.

374
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:48,050
The white GI taught us that word.

375
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:50,800
Everyone want us out.

376
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:56,050
We was too dirty to even clean the toilet.

377
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:02,090
They call our beautiful Michon the cockroach.

378
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,380
No.

379
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:20,880
Good night, Tien.

380
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,340
Good night, Otis.

390
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:27,490
May I ask, how did they end up in your possession?

391
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:30,000
You ask a lotta goddamn questions, wringer.

392
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,850
Monsieur, maybe they're from a bank

393
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:36,370
you just knocked off in Manila.

394
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:39,180
Or maybe the authorities are looking for them.

395
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,280
I don't need that kind of shit.

396
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,700
We ain't no international criminals, you dig?

397
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:47,500
In my line of work, I have to be very careful,

398
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:51,340
and that means knowing exactly who I am in business with.

399
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:54,010
This cat getting on my last goddamn nerve, man.

400
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,700
Gentlemen, I believe our business is finished.

401
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,510
Hey, wait a minute.

402
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:02,010
Do me a favor. Sit down, please? Just give us that respect.

403
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,170
Where were Frenchies in World War II?

404
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:10,270
Hitler had y'all by the snails.

405
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:14,190
The goddamn US of A saved your asses.

406
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,070
If it wasn't for good ol' Uncle Sam, all of yous,

407
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:20,900
y'all be speaking the deutsche eating bratwurst,

408
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,160
schnitzels and sauerkraut

409
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,410
instead of croissants, snails and escargot.

410
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:27,830
Come on, Blood. Let it go.

411
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,400
- No, man, no. - Just let it go!

412
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,170
No, fuck that. I ain't done.

413
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:37,690
This motherfucker can't tell me shit.

414
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:40,800
My daddy, God rest his soul,

415
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:45,150
landed in Normandy and killed beaucoup goose-stepping Nazis.

416
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:46,030
Let me tell you something,

417
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:49,840
them Nazis weren't no punks neither. Not like you.

418
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,910
- Yeah, okay, I'm done. - You feel better?

419
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:58,610
Yeah.

420
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,980
I thank you for this ignorant

421
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:04,740
American one-sided version of World War II.

422
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:08,760
Please understand. He taking big risk.

423
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,870
And we ain't?

424
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:15,410
DaRoach, we gotta trust you, and you gotta trust us.

425
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,620
Mr. Desroche...

426
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,430
Our platoon was ordered to find a C-47 CIA plane

427
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:28,470
that went down with a payroll for the native people. The Lahu.

428
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:31,140
Now, they didn't wanna be paid in paper currency,

429
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,350
so Uncle Sam was paying them

430
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:35,580
in gold bars for their help against the V.C.

431
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:38,180
Well, we found the gold, and we...

432
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:43,350
We bury it. For now. They ask, we say the V.C. Got it.

433
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:47,150
Later on, we come back and collect.

434
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:48,330
You mean rip it off.

435
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:50,360
We ain't ripping off shit!

436
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:53,210
Who feel like they're ripping something off?

437
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:55,850
We was the very first people

438
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:57,790
that died for this red, white and blue.

439
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,830
Yeah, that's right.

440
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:02,080
It was a soul brother,

441
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,040
Crispus Attucks at the motherfuckin' Boston Massacre.

442
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:08,360
We been dying for this country from the very get,

443
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,090
hoping one day they'd give us our rightful place.

444
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:14,610
All they give us was a foot up our black asses. Well, fuck that.

445
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:20,320
I say the USA owe us. We built this bitch!

446
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,310
So, what you sayin', Blood?

447
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:28,000
I'm saying... we repossess this gold...

448
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:30,490
like they about to come

449
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:32,830
repossess your cash yield convertible now.

450
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:38,580
We repossess this gold for

451
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:41,750
every single black boot that never made it home.

452
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,740
Every brother and sister

453
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:46,600
stolen from Mother Africa to Jamestown, Virginia

454
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,990
way back in 1619.

455
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:54,190
We give this gold to our people.

456
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,580
You feel that? You feel it?

457
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:03,300
- Now, let's bury our gold. - Reparations.

458
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,260
Bloods.

460
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:06,930
Bloods.

462
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:13,940
We went back a few weeks later, but the area was napalmed,

463
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:16,420
and we lost all of our landmarks.

464
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,820
But recently, a mudslide

465
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:22,740
has exposed what might be the C-47's tail,

466
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:26,440
and satellite pictures have pinpointed the spot.

467
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,990
You're more informed than your friend here.

468
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:33,150
Sir, are you in or out?

469
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:51,690
This is my last offer per kilo,

470
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,530
less my commission.

471
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,300
Tien said 20.

472
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:09,500
One cannot carry millions of dollars through US Customs.

473
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:13,170
The extra two points will get you a dummy corporation

474
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:16,900
and a tax-free offshore account in Macau.

475
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:21,270
You can then withdraw the funds from any bank in the world.

476
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:23,980
How do I know that you two ain't a con artist team?

477
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:28,510
As you said, you simply must trust us.

478
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:32,840
Yeah, well, the extra 2% comes outta her cut.

479
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:34,710
That's right.

480
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,710
- I'll cover it. - Price of doing business.

481
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:42,710
- So, we good? - Yeah.

482
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:46,240
- I'm good. - Yeah, I'm good.

483
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,770
And, sir,

484
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:52,240
Uncle Sam did no better than France in Vietnam.

485
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:57,810
Gentlemen, I look forward to seeing you again in a few days.

486
00:29:57,810 --> 00:29:59,270
If you will excuse me,

487
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:02,250
I have a lot of things to do for all of us.

489
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,860
And...

490
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,700
vive la France.

491
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,990
This motherfucker, man.

492
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:15,820
I don't take that.

493
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,040
What the fuck are you doing here?

494
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,880
I'm worried about you.

495
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,340
Why?

496
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:36,740
- Well, I found out you were coming here. - And?

497
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:39,340
And I came to check on you.

498
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,620
You don't give a flying fuck about me.

499
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:47,810
I do. You been acting more crazy than usual.

500
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:53,690
Yeah, well...

501
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,750
you consider me checked on.

502
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:00,520
You're here for the gold.

503
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:02,510
Don't lie.

504
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:06,000
You're going after the gold. I read Otis' emails.

505
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:11,600
You gotta choose better passwords. "1-2-3-4"?

506
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:14,620
Come on now, Dad.

507
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,690
What do you want, David?

508
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,660
- An equal share for helping you find it. - Hell to the naw!

509
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,140
The authorities find out about this,

510
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:23,140
y'all go back to the crib empty-handed.

511
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:27,260
So, you just a lil' jive-ass gangster now?

512
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:29,290
After everything you've put me through,

513
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,800
I'd say you getting a basement bargain.

514
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:34,570
You ungrateful lil'...

515
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:38,290
lil' Black Studies teacher nigga.

516
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:43,100
You want to tell your Bloods or should I?

517
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:52,110
You sure know how to raise 'em, don't you?

518
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,750
What happens if we bum-rush your boy

519
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,460
and throw his ass off that balcony?

520
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,890
Know I'm taking a couple of you OGs with me.

521
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:00,130
- Don't ever threaten my son, man. - Or what?

522
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:02,240
Or you will nab more trouble than you know what to do with.

523
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,500
- Come on! - Come on!

524
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,340
Cool it, God damn it! Cool it!

525
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:08,640
David, you are not getting a full share.

526
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,090
- You and your daddy can split a share. - You can forget that.

527
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:12,410
You take it or leave it.

528
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:19,590
You see what you made me do, man?

529
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,800
Let me tell you somethin'.

530
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,540
You ain't been nothin' but an anchor around my neck

531
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:27,440
since the day you were born.

532
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:33,300
Yeah, I said it, and I mean it, too. Take this shit.

533
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,100
God damn it.

534
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:43,320
David, you're a buck private in this outfit.

535
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,570
You do what we say when we say it.

536
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:48,130
No questions asked. Understood?

537
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,690
Overstood, Godfather.

538
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:03,990
I have bad feeling about this, Otis.

539
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:05,160
I'm gonna be all right.

540
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,590
Gold does strange things to people.

541
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:11,100
Even old friends. Be safe.

542
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,170
All right. Yeah.

543
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,030
I just hope I don't have to use it.

544
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:36,100
I'll see you in a bit, all right?

545
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:26,530
- You just gonna stay there? - Motherfucker, go around.

546
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:42,070
- David. - Yeah?

547
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:43,660
Why did you come here?

548
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,290
Well, he's my dad.

549
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:53,110
Feels like my last chance with him.

550
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:58,990
- He needs counseling. - I know.

551
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,390
Talks to himself.

552
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:08,230
Your pops was never the same after we lost Norman.

553
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:15,610
- You know, he calls his name in his sleep. - I can believe that.

554
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:20,180
- Who was that guy? - Norm?

555
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:25,480
That brother was the best damn soldier that ever lived.

556
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:50,190
Wasn't many brothers who made squad leader.

557
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:53,570
The man was using Bloods for cannon fodder.

558
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:57,150
White boys who stayed in college, they'd dodge that shit.

559
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,400
They put our poor black asses on the front line,

560
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,290
killing us off like flies.

561
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:11,700
Stormin' earned his name, was in all kind of firefights.

562
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,050
Trained us in the way of the jungle.

563
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:17,850
Made us believe that we would get home, alive.

573
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,390
To your left!

574
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:59,850
- To your left! - To the left! Go, go!

575
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:08,840
Go!

576
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,320
- Cease fire! - Cease fire!

577
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,260
- Cease fire! - Cease fire!

578
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:27,470
- Everybody all right? - Yeah.

579
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:29,640
- Good right here. - Good, good.

580
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,710
War is about money.

581
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,970
Money is about war.

582
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,680
Every time I walk out my front door,

583
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,850
I see cops patrolling my neighborhood

584
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:44,020
like it's some police state.

585
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:47,590
I can feel just how much I ain't worth.

586
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,390
Gave us something to believe in.

587
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,510
A direction, a purpose.

588
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:57,830
He taught us about black history

589
00:38:57,830 --> 00:38:59,960
when it wasn't really popular back then.

590
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,900
Schooled us about drinking

591
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:04,440
that anti-commie Kool-Aid they was selling.

593
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:08,440
Yeah, he was our Malcolm and our Martin.

594
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:12,160
Norm had a way of keeping us from going off.

595
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:14,230
He wasn't no Tom.

596
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:18,440
He was a bad mother, shut your mouth.

597
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,250
Like Ali.

600
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:30,100
This is the voice of Vietnam,

601
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:32,830
broadcasting from Hanoi,

603
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:37,460
capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

604
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:42,980
Black GI,

605
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,550
in Memphis, Tennessee,

606
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:49,840
a white man assassinate Dr. Martin Luther King...

607
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:54,060
who heroically opposed the cruel

608
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,780
racial discrimination in the USA.

609
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:03,110
Dr. King also opposed the US war in Vietnam.

610
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:05,750
Black GI,

611
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:10,420
your government sent 600,000 troops

614
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:12,170
to crush the rebellion.

615
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:15,180
Your soul sister and soul brothers

618
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:19,600
are enraged in over 122 cities.

621
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:23,840
They kill them while you fight against us,

623
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,630
so far away from where you are needed.

626
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:34,210
Black GI, the South Vietnamese people are resolute

627
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:37,400
against these fascist acts against Negroes

629
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:40,560
who struggle for civil rights and freedom.

632
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:48,480
Negroes are only 11% of the US population,

633
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:53,010
but among troops here in Vietnam, you are 32%.

634
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:59,380
Black GI, is it fair to serve more than the white Americans

635
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:00,890
that sent you here?

636
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,520
Nothing is more confuse than to be ordered into a war to die

637
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,970
or to be maimed for life

638
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:12,370
without the faintest idea of what's going on.

639
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:15,950
I dedicate this next record

640
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:19,900
to the soul brothers of the 1st Infantry Divisions.

641
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:25,170
Big Red One, 2nd Battalion, 136th Regiment.

642
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,770
Have a good day, gentlemen.

643
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,660
Be safe.

644
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:36,790
- Goddamn bullshit. - Got the wrong motherfucking enemy!

645
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:39,210
Yeah, goddamn white man gone too far.

646
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:42,600
- The Bible says an eye for an eye. - And a tooth for a tooth.

647
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,220
We need to kill some crackers.

648
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:47,270
Our brothers and sisters are burnin' shit down back home, Norm.

649
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:51,560
I love you, man, but you're wrong. Dead wrong.

650
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:53,470
You're talking about Dr. King.

651
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,820
You're talking about a man of peace.

652
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:59,140
And that's what got Dr. King killed.

653
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:00,910
I'm as mad as everybody.

654
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:03,460
All us Bloods got a right to be, but...

655
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,420
we Bloods.

656
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:11,580
Won't let nobody use our rage against us. We control our rage.

657
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:16,200
Now, what y'all are trying to do right now ain't changing shit.

658
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:20,190
So, stand down. That's an order.

659
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,530
Nah. Fuck an order, Norm!

660
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,500
You're gonna have to kill me first.

661
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:31,320
Blood on Blood.

662
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:38,680
And let me tell you, out of all of us,

663
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,680
your pops was closest to him.

664
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:43,290
Believed in Norman like a religion.

665
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:46,170
I don't think he believed in anything since.

666
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:51,480
Floating market. You brothers want anything?

667
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:52,870
Is there some barbecue up in here?

668
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:54,620
I might get a couple of things.

669
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:00,830
What's that? You got bananas?

671
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:04,930
Hey, who wants a cold one?

672
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:07,770
- Six pack. - Bring 'em on up.

673
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:09,480
Hey, don't let her get on.

674
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:12,490
That's good.

675
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:14,410
- Oranges? - Get your beer here.

676
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:16,010
This is good.

677
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:17,610
- Here you go. - You're gonna cut it open?

678
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:20,130
No, I'm good. So, how you eat it?

679
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:22,350
It tastes like chicken.

680
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:25,570
That probably don't taste like chicken. That's race-related.

683
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:31,040
Got any money?

685
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:34,050
No, man. Not today. Không.

687
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:35,400
Không. Không. No.

688
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,480
Let me get some bananas.

689
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,700
- I know, that's what I'm getting. - Bananas.

690
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:42,470
- That's amazing. - You see this?

691
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:44,180
No, and thank you. Yes, it is.

692
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:44,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

693
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,960
There you go.

694
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:48,300
That's great. No, thank you. No, thanks.

696
00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:52,700
- Hello! - What's up with that?

699
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:56,160
No, not today. Not today.

702
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:02,830
No, I don't want it. Nah. No, I--

703
00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:04,500
- Chicken. - No, man. I...

704
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:05,810
No, man. I...

705
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:09,470
Okay, due respect. No.

707
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:13,030
No. Okay, all due respect, no.

708
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:14,940
Vinh, talk to your... Talk to this man.

709
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:18,060
Come on, no means no in any motherfucking language, right?

710
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:20,990
Come on, man. Come talk to him, man.

712
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:23,290
No!

714
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:26,760
Vinh, come talk to him!

715
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:29,890
No, man! Back up, okay.

716
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:32,470
Just back up. Back up, please.

718
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:35,670
Shut the fuck up. I don't wanna hear that gook shit.

720
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:39,640
You know what?

721
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,060
Fuck this place, man.

722
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:44,060
Backward-ass people.

724
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:46,730
- Hey! Get that fucking thing off of me! - Hey, get him.

725
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:48,820
- These backward-ass motherfuckers, man. - Yeah. Let's go.

726
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:51,620
Shit! I don't know what the fuck he got!

727
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:52,500
Come on. Come on, man.

728
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,760
- No, motherfucker! - Let's go. Dad, come on.

729
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,760
Man, it's just a goddamn chicken.

732
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:01,450
What?

734
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:07,260
You don't know nothing about me, man! Fuck that!

736
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:09,960
You don't know shit about me!

737
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,830
I didn't kill your mother and father! Fuck you!

739
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:14,450
You don't know me!

740
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:15,460
Let's go. Come on.

741
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:17,920
You don't know what the fuck you're talking about!

743
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,470
What the fuck you know about me?

745
00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:22,660
Paul, relax!

746
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:25,560
Man, nah! He kept coming up on me!

748
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:28,260
- I know. - What the fuck?

750
00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:30,040
What the fuck is going down?

751
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:32,270
I got you. I got you, brother.

753
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:33,440
Stop talking, and fuck you!

754
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,360
- Get the boat moving! - Move on, man!

755
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,230
- I got you. - Stop fucking talking!

756
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:40,060
- Don't know shit about me. - You killed my father and mother!

757
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:41,070
What are you doing?

758
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:43,050
He knows what "gook" means, man!

759
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:44,630
I don't give a fuck about that!

760
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:48,260
I don't give two fucks about that. I tried to talk to the man.

762
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:50,860
Put the fucking camera down.

763
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:52,390
You're just having a panic attack.

764
00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:53,920
This shit happen to you all the time?

765
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:56,470
- Yeah, he has PTSD. - This happen all the time?

766
00:46:56,470 --> 00:46:57,700
- He gets triggered. - Come on.

767
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:58,920
The guy off with his shit. It be all right.

768
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:02,520
Hey, David. What you know about it, huh?

769
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:04,300
You don't know nothin' about this.

770
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:07,350
- I don't have no fucking-- - Nightmares.

771
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:08,110
You been having nightmares.

772
00:47:08,110 --> 00:47:09,920
- He does. - I don't have no nightmares.

773
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,340
- You do. - We all got PTSD.

774
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:13,710
- Come on and tell me. Look. - Just breathe, come on.

775
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:14,770
I see...

776
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:16,770
- Come on. - I...

777
00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:21,670
Come on, bud. Come on. There you go. There you go.

778
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:24,340
- Come on. - I see ghosts, y'all.

779
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,010
I see...

780
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,180
ghosts.

781
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:31,010
Well, it happens to all of us, man!

782
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:32,630
- You seen 'em, too? - Yeah.

783
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,100
Dead come to you at night?

784
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:39,430
Stormin' Norm comes to me damn near every night.

785
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:42,120
Now, he talk to y'all like he talk to me?

786
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,530
- Brother, come on. - I don't think so.

787
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:46,170
Come on. Come on.

788
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:48,130
- Take it easy, man. - Go ahead, get it out.

789
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:49,970
- Yeah. - Get it out. Come on now.

790
00:47:50,210 --> 00:47:52,390
- Come on, bud. - Think I'm a crazy fuck, don't you?

791
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:53,260
No!

792
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:55,040
- Come on, man. - Smart niggas, huh?

793
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,420
- It ain't like that. - Man, don't call me that.

794
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:00,240
That's right. Y'all saditty niggas don't like that word.

795
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,960
You know what, man? Nigga. Nigga.

796
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:06,320
Nigga. Nigga. Nigga!

797
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,110
A yellow nigga.

798
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:08,930
- What? - You feel me?

799
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:12,110
Look, I'm tired of this bullshit! Squash it!

800
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:16,320
I'm with you. I'm with you.

801
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:19,630
Fists up!

802
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:28,170
Get in there, David. Get in there. Put your fist up, David.

803
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:30,240
Come on.

804
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:35,440
You, too, Vinh. Go ahead! Fist up, man.

805
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:36,450
Come on, Paul.

806
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:45,570
- Bloods! - Norm! Norm!

807
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:22,860
Get that out of my face.

808
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:24,220
Get that out of my face.

809
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:38,610
And I told him, "Pick your poison,"

810
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:41,010
and he told the waitress to pick the poison.

811
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:42,510
- Excuse me. - Sorry.

812
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:45,130
- How's it going, boss? - How you doin'?

813
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,050
I'll be better at the bar.

814
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:55,160
Didn't think I'd meet another American here.

815
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:00,930
But I'm French.

816
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:03,310
- Beg your pardon? - I'm French.

817
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:04,860
Sit.

818
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:09,180
You're traveling alone?

819
00:50:09,870 --> 00:50:12,130
I'm here with a group of Vietnam vets.

820
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:14,290
One is my father.

821
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:17,910
Must be something powerful,

822
00:50:18,290 --> 00:50:20,770
coming back after all these years with your father.

823
00:50:21,290 --> 00:50:23,410
- Yeah, it's powerful all right. - Yeah.

824
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:25,180
What is your name?

825
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:30,590
Hedy. Like Hedy Lamarr. No?

826
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:32,670
Old time Hollywood star.

827
00:50:33,970 --> 00:50:36,520
But, well, my last name is Bouvier, so...

828
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:38,580
Cool.

829
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:40,440
It's cool.

830
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:45,060
- Uh, I'm David. - Ah, David from the Bible.

831
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,410
Like David Ruffin from the Temptations.

832
00:50:49,470 --> 00:50:50,510
Motown.

833
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:53,070
Yeah, you got it.

834
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:59,550
Is there another place to go at night around here?

836
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:16,510
Have you ever seen so many scooters in your life?

837
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:20,950
Thank you.

839
00:51:24,090 --> 00:51:24,810
So...

840
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:28,370
what's their story?

841
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:32,580
Well, Simon is my best friend.

842
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:38,610
And Seppo and I use each other for sex once in a blue moon.

843
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:45,160
What do you, Simon and Sep... Seppo... Seppo... what do you do?

844
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:49,760
We locate old landmines, and detonate bombs, too.

845
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:53,280
- Wow, okay. - "Wow, okay!"

846
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,570
Yeah, that's some gangster shit. For sure!

847
00:51:56,330 --> 00:51:58,090
How does one get involved

848
00:51:58,090 --> 00:52:01,300
in the landmine disposal business? Pray tell.

849
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:04,950
The Bouviers have a history in Vietnam.

850
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:09,690
It's strange how a war never ends for those involved.

851
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:12,760
See, like, landmines planted years ago...

852
00:52:13,890 --> 00:52:17,490
and still harvesting death all these years later.

853
00:52:17,710 --> 00:52:19,000
Back to your family history.

854
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:25,050
My family made several fortunes owning a rubber plantation,

855
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,330
and then they bought up much

856
00:52:27,330 --> 00:52:29,960
more of the rice market and made another fortune.

857
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:31,740
See, the white gold.

858
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,950
Wonderful family business.

859
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:39,890
But one exception,

860
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:42,960
we exploited the shit out of the Vietnamese people.

861
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:45,640
So, that's the meaning behind the mines.

862
00:52:46,350 --> 00:52:49,020
So, what did the Bouvier family think about what you do?

863
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:50,270
What family?

864
00:52:53,730 --> 00:52:56,390
I'm the founder and the director of LAMB,

865
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:59,650
which I started three years ago.

866
00:52:59,890 --> 00:53:00,590
Lamb?

867
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:05,280
Yeah, LAMB. Love Against Mines and Bombs.

868
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:12,710
No. I must look like some Patty Hearst heiress

869
00:53:12,710 --> 00:53:17,950
who's cast herself as a guilt-ridden bourgeoisie cliche.

870
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:21,160
Hey, look, I know all about bourgeoisie cliches.

871
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:25,340
I'm a poverty-stricken fool who loves teaching kids.

872
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:28,450
However, my guilt trip is a lot less dangerous than yours.

873
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:29,860
- Yeah, less dangerous. - Yeah.

874
00:53:30,410 --> 00:53:31,910
Unless you count school shootings.

875
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,310
School shootings. No fun.

876
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:40,060
You always been the solid one, always.

877
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:45,160
Got a... wife who loves you. Daughter who loves you.

878
00:53:45,710 --> 00:53:48,700
You got a son who loves you enough for two daddies.

879
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:50,700
I couldn't love David...

880
00:53:53,770 --> 00:53:54,580
back.

881
00:53:58,670 --> 00:54:02,240
You got back to the world, you made that transition.

882
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:07,370
Me, I'm all... fucked up inside.

883
00:54:08,190 --> 00:54:09,580
I'm broken, man.

884
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:16,440
Broken.

885
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:20,730
Fuck.

886
00:54:24,330 --> 00:54:27,130
- Blood, we're all broken. - Not like me, man.

887
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:29,160
Norm and I were holding those

888
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:32,720
gooks back when the man bought it. I see him.

889
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:37,370
I saw him die, man.

890
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:47,190
- So what? You're blaming yourself? - You don't even know.

891
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:53,920
Paul, when we get back to the world,

892
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,680
I'd like you to come with me to a meeting.

893
00:54:56,270 --> 00:54:58,560
I don't do that "Sit in a circle,

894
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:00,250
whine about shit" group thing, man.

895
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:03,160
I don't do it. I never have and I never will.

896
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:05,580
You got to talk to somebody.

897
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:09,730
I talk to my brother Stormin' Norman every single night.

900
00:55:17,770 --> 00:55:20,730
- Yeah. - Oh, oh, oh, drink, drink.

902
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:36,620
Simon.

903
00:55:38,170 --> 00:55:40,920
- David. - David. Okay. How's it going?

904
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:41,920
I can't call it.

905
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:45,640
Hey, that dude over there by the bar, is he with you?

906
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:47,710
- He's getting pretty shit-faced. - Brotherman.

909
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:54,130
It's been an emotional trip.

910
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:56,160
It appears so.

911
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:00,470
You Americans are just incredibly uninformed.

912
00:56:01,830 --> 00:56:04,400
I guess you're too busy watching reality TV,

913
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:08,080
or electing a reality TV clown for a president.

914
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:08,940
Knew that was coming.

915
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:12,640
Well, on behalf of all the black folks in the USA,

916
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:15,040
which are the only group who didn't vote for the motherfucker,

917
00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:17,570
we plead innocent to all charges,

918
00:56:17,570 --> 00:56:19,790
claims, accusations, allegations,

919
00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:23,370
and associations connected to the Klansman in the Oval Office,

920
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:24,550
so help me God.

922
00:56:27,610 --> 00:56:30,880
The Bloods search for the lost treasure of youth

923
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:33,990
and the remains of the dearly departed Norman Earl Holloway...

924
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:38,690
- We're going. - KIA, December 7th, 1971.

925
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:43,700
We're here to bring home a fallen brother. A brother!

926
00:56:44,850 --> 00:56:50,310
A tomb is sacred, not to be looted by rogues and vandals.

927
00:56:50,310 --> 00:56:54,350
There's gold in them hills! Gold, goddamn it, gold!

928
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,570
Thanks for getting us this far, Vinh.

929
00:57:34,570 --> 00:57:35,390
My pleasure.

930
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:37,950
I gotta tell you, you put on one hell of a tour.

931
00:57:37,950 --> 00:57:41,590
- Sure do. Thanks Vinhi-vin. - You're welcome.

932
00:57:42,370 --> 00:57:43,810
Nothing is more precious than

933
00:57:43,810 --> 00:57:47,090
independence and liberty. Said by our uncle.

934
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:49,810
- What uncle? - Uncle Ho Chi Minh.

935
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:51,360
Now he's your uncle?

936
00:57:51,970 --> 00:57:54,920
Actually, he's the father of modern-day Vietnam.

937
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:56,430
Like your George Washington.

938
00:57:56,650 --> 00:58:01,680
- Oh, my dear misinformed, misguided... - Thank you.

939
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:03,340
Vietnamese brother.

940
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:08,660
Our Uncle George owned 123 slaves.

941
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:14,680
And as they say in our colonists' second language, touche.

942
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:18,820
Get your arms out, man. Get your arms out. And back, too.

943
00:58:19,470 --> 00:58:21,120
All right, get my arms and my back, man.

944
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:23,840
- What's up? - Arms and back!

945
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:25,280
There, I got you. I got you.

946
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:27,850
Bloods, I can't believe we back up in this bitch.

947
00:58:28,830 --> 00:58:31,620
I'll meet you at this rendezvous location in a few days.

948
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:33,680
- All right. - If you're late or early, don't worry.

949
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:34,370
I'll be there.

950
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:36,470
I hope you find your friend.

951
00:58:41,610 --> 00:58:42,610
Bon voyage.

953
00:58:46,510 --> 00:58:48,060
- Showtime. - Showtime, baby.

954
00:58:50,910 --> 00:58:53,180
- Bloods. - I'm gonna teach you that.

955
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:54,170
Y'all ready?

956
00:58:54,170 --> 00:58:55,190
- Yeah, let's go. - Yeah.

957
00:58:55,190 --> 00:58:56,130
You got the paperwork?

958
00:58:56,180 --> 00:58:57,880
You can see I got the paperwork with me.

959
00:58:58,110 --> 00:59:00,470
Is that a MAGA hat? God damn!

960
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:02,210
Straight, straight. I got you.

962

How you holding up?

973
01:00:06,550 --> 01:00:08,340
Boy, you ask me that every five minutes.

974
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:10,620
You know, I did make it through Nam on my own.

975
01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:12,170
Typical tours, too.

976
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:14,500
Hey! Hey, hold up.

977
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:16,660
Let Otis catch up.

978
01:00:17,150 --> 01:00:19,250
Damn, Paul, you can still hump it out on point.

979
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:20,260
Oh, yeah, baby.

980
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:21,880
What happens if somebody get heatstroke

981
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:23,630
or sprain an ankle or something?

982
01:00:23,850 --> 01:00:26,470
Otis is a medic. A good one, too.

983
01:00:26,530 --> 01:00:28,340
Even took a few rounds out of me once.

984
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:30,710
From your black monkey ass, as I recall.

985
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:34,960
What's that?

986
01:00:35,970 --> 01:00:36,650
Water.

987
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,760
What? I need to take a breathalyzer test?

988
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:44,830
- Well, what are those? - It's something for my hip.

989
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:46,770
I know that. But what are they?

990
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:48,860
OxyContin.

991
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:51,080
Are you fuckin' kiddin' me?

992
01:00:51,370 --> 01:00:52,420
You think I'm sneakin' a drink,

993
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:54,600
and you on that opioid epidemic shit.

994
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:57,540
- It's prescribed. - Oh, yeah. You writing the prescriptions?

995
01:00:57,790 --> 01:01:00,720
No, the VA. Just like everybody else.

996
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:02,460
You best be careful with that shit.

997
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:05,250
- What is this, an intervention? - You need one?

998
01:01:07,570 --> 01:01:10,830
Y'all think I'm a junkie?

999
01:01:14,260 --> 01:01:15,010
Oh, shit.

1000
01:01:15,830 --> 01:01:18,310
There. I don't need this shit.

1001
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:48,160
This way.

1004
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:09,710
Let's go.

1005
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:22,390
You know he hurting.

1006
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:27,690
Yeah, man. I hope he's gonna be okay.

1007
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:40,940
Dad!

1008
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:43,760
Dad, what the hell is that?

1009
01:02:48,970 --> 01:02:49,930
Dad! Dad!

1010
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:54,430
Gibbons.

1011
01:02:56,270 --> 01:02:58,720
I seen a leopard tear one apart once.

1012
01:02:59,310 --> 01:03:00,550
There are leopards out here?

1013
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:05,300
Leopards are all gone now. Poachers wiped 'em out.

1014
01:03:05,770 --> 01:03:07,790
- You see that? - What? What? What?

1015
01:03:09,020 --> 01:03:10,900
Looked like a man walking out there.

1016
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:13,760
It was just a flash, but I saw it.

1017
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:19,230
- Maybe-- maybe it was a monkey. - No goddamn monkey.

1018
01:03:26,270 --> 01:03:27,290
Hey, you see something?

1019
01:03:29,930 --> 01:03:33,720
Clear. Clear.

1020
01:03:38,530 --> 01:03:39,660
Oh, my God.

1021
01:03:47,730 --> 01:03:52,410
I'm sorry about being on edge, you know. Being back here...

1022
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:57,160
it is not easy.

1023
01:04:00,020 --> 01:04:00,770
It's cool.

1024
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:05,900
I don't like the way you did it, but I'm glad you're here.

1025
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:13,060
Your daddy loves you, you know.

1026
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:15,840
You know that, right?

1027
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:20,760
- You've got a funny way of showing it. - Yeah.

1028
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:22,540
But I do. I know it.

1029
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:26,060
I love you back.

1030
01:04:33,530 --> 01:04:38,650
Damn! Who got the bug spray? Bugs out here eating my ass up.

1031
01:04:40,220 --> 01:04:41,630
Otis had it last.

1032
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:43,450
Well, can you walk your

1033
01:04:43,450 --> 01:04:45,880
big pigeon-toed ass over there and get it?

1034
01:04:46,470 --> 01:04:48,260
What's wrong with your big lumbering ass?

1035
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:50,160
Man, you sitting right there.

1036
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:52,190
- Oh, shit. - You sitting right next to the bug spray.

1037
01:04:52,190 --> 01:04:53,550
I gotta get up from my rock, walk over there and get it.

1038
01:04:53,550 --> 01:04:55,920
You're one lazy-ass motherfucker.

1039
01:04:55,980 --> 01:05:00,320
You a Thanksgiving jive turkey giblet sorry-ass motherfucker.

1040
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:02,650
- Shut up. He's trying to sleep. - We up, he should be up.

1041
01:05:02,650 --> 01:05:04,660
Every time, you want me to get the shit.

1042
01:05:05,290 --> 01:05:07,510
You can't get up and do it your damn self.

1043
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:10,450
I got to get up off my damn rock and walk over there and get it.

1044
01:05:10,450 --> 01:05:13,480
You sitting right there. You get it?

1045
01:05:13,710 --> 01:05:16,920
You see it? Big paddle ass. God damn.

1046
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:17,920
Hey, Paul.

1047
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:36,300
Ain't this a bitch?

1048
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:42,730
Nigga, get up.

1049
01:05:43,010 --> 01:05:44,350
- What? - Get up, nigga.

1050
01:05:46,030 --> 01:05:47,250
Why you ain't tell us, man?

1051
01:05:47,350 --> 01:05:49,470
- What? - What?

1052
01:05:49,810 --> 01:05:52,080
No wonder he wanted to make all the arrangements.

1053
01:05:52,170 --> 01:05:54,690
- Tien give this to you? - So, what about it?

1054
01:05:54,690 --> 01:05:56,350
We should all be packin', you--

1055
01:05:56,350 --> 01:05:57,580
- No. - Get the gun!

1056
01:05:57,580 --> 01:05:59,300
- Come on, man! - You motherfucker!

1057
01:05:59,350 --> 01:06:01,540
- Come on. Beat his ass down, now. - Shit.

1058
01:06:03,150 --> 01:06:03,810
You all right?

1059
01:06:03,810 --> 01:06:05,870
You a pussy-whipped motherfucker, ain't you?

1060
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,490
Man, you don't see who she is?

1061
01:06:08,690 --> 01:06:10,620
And that French fuck, Desroche.

1062
01:06:10,690 --> 01:06:13,220
I don't know Desroche from Adam's house cat,

1063
01:06:14,290 --> 01:06:16,730
but if Tiên vouched for him, that's good enough for me.

1064
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:20,920
She's a Soul Alley ho, remember that.

1065
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:24,030
You know, Paul, you better check yourself.

1066
01:06:24,050 --> 01:06:27,330
I know your mama-san's slanted pussy strung you out.

1067
01:06:27,330 --> 01:06:29,520
She's still a fucking ho!

1068
01:06:31,390 --> 01:06:32,570
Whoa, whoa, man!

1069
01:06:32,570 --> 01:06:36,020
Get your motherfucking hands off me! I'll kill you!

1070
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:38,520
- I'll kill that motherfucker. - Chill! Chill! Chill!

1071
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:40,160
Chill! What the fuck's wrong with you?

1072
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:42,960
Breathe, man!

1073
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:45,670
- Come on. - Give it to him.

1074
01:06:47,030 --> 01:06:48,120
Go ahead, give it to him.

1075
01:06:51,620 --> 01:06:52,780
Take it. I'm through with it.

1076
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:56,410
Here.

1077
01:06:58,100 --> 01:06:58,920
Happy?

1078
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:07,060
Man, we're walking right on top of it.

1079
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:10,310
You said that on the last hill. Perspective's totally different.

1080
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:11,770
No, it's gotta be here.

1081
01:07:12,020 --> 01:07:15,170
God damn! We're fucking lost!

1082
01:07:15,850 --> 01:07:18,510
- Otis and Eddie think they slick. - What?

1083
01:07:18,510 --> 01:07:20,270
Marching us around and around in circles

1084
01:07:20,270 --> 01:07:21,550
so we give up and go home.

1085
01:07:22,410 --> 01:07:25,030
You come back, you collect it all for yourself, huh?

1086
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:28,050
Then why'd I follow your sorry ass out here in the first place?

1087
01:07:28,050 --> 01:07:30,380
'Cause you couldn't afford the airfare, the gear, hotel.

1088
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:34,620
You needed Banker Drysdale right there.

1089
01:07:34,620 --> 01:07:35,390
Shut up!

1090
01:07:37,630 --> 01:07:39,090
You and Tiên are up to something.

1091
01:07:40,510 --> 01:07:42,900
Let me tell you something, Otis, all y'all.

1092
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:49,720
I don't need this shit. You got me? I'm here for Norm.

1093
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:55,290
I'm here for Norm. I ain't going for no okey-doke bullshit.

1094
01:07:55,540 --> 01:07:58,960
Dope fiend double-cross, hell no. Fuck that.

1095
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:03,340
Where you going? Where you going, boy?

1096
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:05,680
I'mma go down to the bank and make a deposit.

1097
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:09,570
- Go on, son. Handle your business. - Let me see that GPS.

1098
01:08:13,660 --> 01:08:15,090
This don't make no damn sense.

1099
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:20,160
Shit, man. Come on.

1100
01:09:00,670 --> 01:09:03,240
- Hey, Dad! Hey, guys! - What?

1101
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:04,900
I think I found something!

1102
01:09:05,130 --> 01:09:06,710
- Gold! Gold! - Oh, shit.

1103
01:09:06,710 --> 01:09:07,790
Quick, bring a shovel!

1104
01:09:07,830 --> 01:09:12,530
I think I found the gold! Gold! Dad! Dad, I found it!

1105
01:09:12,530 --> 01:09:14,460
- I hope he really found that shit. - Gold!

1106
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:15,720
Where you at, son?

1107
01:09:15,830 --> 01:09:16,680
Watch your step.

1108
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:18,450
Shit, get your shovels!

1109
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:21,610
Bring your shovels! Bring the shovels!

1110
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:24,590
I found it! I found it! I found it!

1111
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:29,640
- Watch your step over there. - Right.

1112
01:09:35,190 --> 01:09:37,050
Holy shit!

1113
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:40,770
- That's it, ain't it? - That's it.

1114
01:09:42,730 --> 01:09:43,840
Holy...

1115
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:49,920
- God damn! - Oh, man!

1116
01:09:49,930 --> 01:09:51,300
- Let me see. - Yeah, that's it.

1117
01:09:51,470 --> 01:09:52,460
Oh, shit.

1118
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:01,070
Damn!

1119
01:10:04,590 --> 01:10:07,080
Check your map. Check your map. Check your map.

1120
01:10:08,870 --> 01:10:10,120
We're in the right coordinates.

1121
01:10:13,430 --> 01:10:16,130
- Yeah. Yeah. - Hey, y'all.

1122
01:10:16,130 --> 01:10:20,200
Hallowed ground, Bloods. Holy ground.

1123
01:10:21,860 --> 01:10:24,140
Yeah, that's it, right? That's it.

1124
01:10:24,650 --> 01:10:25,540
Yeah, that's it.

1125
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:26,950
- Oh, Lord. - Yeah, that's it.

1126
01:10:26,950 --> 01:10:29,040
- Thank you, Lord. - Yeah, that's it!

1127
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:31,710
Yeah! Yeah, it is! Yeah, it is!

1128
01:10:31,710 --> 01:10:33,440
Yeah, it is, Bloods!

1129
01:10:36,230 --> 01:10:37,170
Let me get a picture.

1130
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:39,490
No! No evidence, man. No evidence.

1131
01:10:39,490 --> 01:10:41,390
- Put that camera down. - My bad.

1132
01:10:41,390 --> 01:10:42,250
Hold that, man.

1133
01:10:46,410 --> 01:10:47,140
Yeah.

1134
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:49,800
- Yeah! Yeah! - Yeah!

1135
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:52,460
Yeah! Yeah!

1136
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:53,090
Come on!

1137
01:10:55,180 --> 01:10:56,000
Come on!

1138
01:11:00,330 --> 01:11:01,840
Oh, yeah. Come on, man.

1139
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:03,630
- Come on, now! - Come on, man, get it.

1140
01:11:05,690 --> 01:11:07,670
Guys! Guys! I got something!

1141
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:10,100
I got something right here! Right here.

1142
01:11:10,670 --> 01:11:12,050
I'm getting a hit right there.

1143
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:15,600
- Right here? - Yeah.

1144
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:16,220
Okay.

1145
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:22,280
- Yeah, that's something there. - You in? Oh, shit!

1146
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:23,260
That's it right there.

1147
01:11:24,850 --> 01:11:25,780
This the spot, right here?

1148
01:11:26,620 --> 01:11:29,070
- Wait, I see something here. - Watch your fingers.

1149
01:11:29,150 --> 01:11:32,180
- Otis, it's right there. - Mind your hand. Look out.

1150
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:33,250
Look out for your hands.

1151
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:38,610
- Let's go. That's a lid! - I got a handle.

1152
01:11:40,350 --> 01:11:41,650
- Shit! - What, it just come off?

1153
01:11:41,650 --> 01:11:43,920
- Damn handle broke. - Shit. It rusted.

1154
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:45,820
Don't put the dirt back where I dug it out!

1155
01:11:45,820 --> 01:11:47,500
- Move it out the damn way! - It's all right.

1156
01:11:49,220 --> 01:11:51,760
Here, let's just grab it. Grab it. It looks like...

1157
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:53,830
Yeah. Ready? Bring it up!

1158
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:03,350
Shit. Wait, where is it? Where is it?

1159
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:05,820
Come on! You gotta be kidding me.

1160
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:07,020
Let me tip it.

1161
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:10,890
Fuckin' fool's gold.

1162
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:16,970
We are some gold-plated fools, y'all.

1163
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:20,070
We're some gold-plated motherfucking fools.

1164
01:12:20,070 --> 01:12:23,110
Hey, guys, guys, I got another one! I got something right here.

1165
01:12:23,110 --> 01:12:23,820
Where?

1166
01:12:23,820 --> 01:12:25,190
- Right here. - I got it!

1167
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:27,740
- Right there! - I got it! I got it! I got it!

1168
01:12:27,740 --> 01:12:28,690
- Got that one? - Yeah.

1169
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:29,390
All right, go.

1170
01:12:31,530 --> 01:12:33,030
- I got another one! - I got it!

1171
01:12:33,030 --> 01:12:34,820
- I got another one right here. - I'm coming!

1172
01:12:34,820 --> 01:12:36,180
- Right there. - All right.

1173
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:37,600
- You good? - I'm good.

1174
01:12:48,990 --> 01:12:50,030
I got a hit! Oh, shit!

1175
01:12:50,030 --> 01:12:51,270
I'm getting hits everywhere!

1176
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:55,220
- Right there. Right there. - All right. Come on.

1177
01:12:58,650 --> 01:13:00,890
- I'm getting hits all over the damn place. - Oh, shit!

1178
01:13:03,820 --> 01:13:06,720
All right. Put it in your pocket. Put it in your pocket.

1179
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:11,970
- All right, I got three right here. - I got one here.

1180
01:13:13,820 --> 01:13:15,520
Keep digging. Keep digging.

1181
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:22,060
I'm getting hits all over the mountain! All over the mountain!

1182
01:13:28,860 --> 01:13:30,060
Come on, give me some.

1183
01:13:32,110 --> 01:13:33,060
Come on, baby.

1184
01:13:34,490 --> 01:13:37,110
Hey, I got one here. I got one here.

1185
01:13:37,110 --> 01:13:38,930
They must've fallen in the mudslide.

1186
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:42,070
Hey, I got something to tell y'all.

1187
01:13:42,070 --> 01:13:42,930
- What? - What?

1188
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:48,970
Holy motherfucking, motherfucking, mother of gold!

1189
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:51,930
- Mother of gold, motherfucker! - Get your ass over here!

1190
01:13:52,070 --> 01:13:54,020
Why don't you start digging, roody-poo?

1191
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:56,110
Motherfucker, I don't dig for the gold!

1192
01:13:56,110 --> 01:13:57,890
I find the motherfucking gold!

1193
01:13:57,900 --> 01:13:59,240
- Fuck you! - Silly-ass.

1194
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:02,060
- Watch your fingers. - Come on! Keep digging!

1195
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:08,770
Forty-five thousand per bar. Seventeen million all in.

1196
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:10,680
Yeah.

1197
01:14:11,610 --> 01:14:13,390
But I'm not leaving here without Norman.

1198
01:14:13,990 --> 01:14:16,770
You think Norman cares whether you find his remains or not?

1199
01:14:17,490 --> 01:14:18,970
You remember what Norman said.

1200
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:20,890
"That gold should go to our people."

1201
01:14:23,110 --> 01:14:24,890
Whoa, what you trying to say, man?

1202
01:14:25,740 --> 01:14:28,100
That gold should go towards black liberation.

1203
01:14:28,450 --> 01:14:31,180
Yeah, our black liberation. You do for self.

1204
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:34,270
I'm talking about black reparations, man.

1205
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:35,640
I got mine's.

1206
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:37,600
What about our people?

1207
01:14:37,820 --> 01:14:39,140
What about my people?

1208
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:41,320
You do what you want with your share,

1209
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:43,190
and we'll each decide for ourselves.

1210
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:46,180
- That's what Norman said now. - Now, see? See? Otis knows.

1211
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:49,940
Norman wanted that gold to go towards the cause.

1212
01:14:49,950 --> 01:14:51,820
Yeah, that's easy for you to say, Eddie.

1213
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:54,190
You rich. Money don't mean shit to you.

1214
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:57,320
- I am not rich. - Yeah, right. Whatever.

1215
01:14:57,320 --> 01:14:59,440
- I'm not rich! - Okay.

1216
01:14:59,450 --> 01:15:02,930
- I'm broke, man. - How the fuck are you broke, Eddie? Huh?

1217
01:15:06,740 --> 01:15:09,640
- I lost it all. - Oh, he bullshittin'.

1218
01:15:11,030 --> 01:15:12,310
I wish I was, man.

1219
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:14,180
Spill it.

1220
01:15:17,110 --> 01:15:18,310
Come on, man. Fess up.

1221
01:15:22,530 --> 01:15:27,350
Ex-wives, bad investments, back taxes,

1222
01:15:27,610 --> 01:15:31,060
livin' large, drinking, being stupid.

1223
01:15:31,610 --> 01:15:33,390
You fuckin' name it, I spent money on it.

1224
01:15:33,650 --> 01:15:35,400
But you paid for all of this shit.

1225
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:37,030
Yeah, yeah, I paid for all this shit

1226
01:15:37,030 --> 01:15:39,390
on a black card that's already overdrawn.

1227
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:43,770
What about all them car dealerships with your name on 'em?

1228
01:15:44,860 --> 01:15:45,810
I don't own 'em.

1229
01:15:46,820 --> 01:15:49,140
I mean, my name is good in the business and all, and...

1230
01:15:49,530 --> 01:15:51,270
dealers choose to use 'em, but...

1231
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:54,220
they'll pull that shit as soon as it stops working for 'em.

1232
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:56,930
I'm telling you, I ain't got a pot to piss in

1233
01:15:57,030 --> 01:16:00,100
or a window to throw it out of. And that's facts!

1234
01:16:04,530 --> 01:16:05,430
God damn.

1235
01:16:07,740 --> 01:16:08,680
Sorry, bro.

1236
01:16:11,450 --> 01:16:12,810
Can we just go find Norm?

1237
01:16:15,820 --> 01:16:17,350
Stormin' Norm's been waiting.

1238
01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:27,680
Damn.

1239
01:16:29,450 --> 01:16:30,890
Ain't that some doo-doo.

1240
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:07,810
Hey, Bloods, I got something!

1241
01:17:08,490 --> 01:17:10,180
Right here I got... I'm getting a big hit.

1242
01:17:10,990 --> 01:17:13,190
- I'm getting a big hit, right here. - Are you sure?

1243
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:15,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's all over,

1244
01:17:15,450 --> 01:17:17,270
right in here. Right in this whole area.

1245
01:17:23,780 --> 01:17:25,470
It's a big hit. Right here. Right here.

1246
01:17:27,030 --> 01:17:28,430
Right in here, baby. Right in there.

1247
01:17:53,990 --> 01:17:55,890
Oh, my God! Oh, God!

1248
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:04,430
That's...

1249
01:18:07,570 --> 01:18:08,470
Shit.

1250
01:18:15,990 --> 01:18:16,890
It's Norm.

1251
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:20,390
Oh, brother.

1252
01:18:54,450 --> 01:18:55,310
It's Norm?

1253
01:18:56,150 --> 01:18:57,930
- Yeah, it's Norm. - Oh, shit.

1254
01:19:13,950 --> 01:19:15,470
Okay. Okay.

1255
01:19:15,990 --> 01:19:17,890
Holy shit. Come on.

1256
01:19:21,490 --> 01:19:23,720
Shit. Shit.

1257
01:19:29,070 --> 01:19:29,770
Shit.

1258
01:19:32,780 --> 01:19:33,600
Hey, Norm.

1259
01:19:35,610 --> 01:19:36,680
We all here, man.

1260
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:41,220
Otis, Melvin, Eddie.

1261
01:19:44,610 --> 01:19:47,640
I got my son, David. Right here.

1262
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:53,770
Took us a little longer than we thought, but...

1263
01:19:55,490 --> 01:19:57,600
we came back like we said we would.

1264
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:04,640
But this time when we get on that plane, that Freedom Bird,

1265
01:20:05,150 --> 01:20:06,520
going back to the world,

1266
01:20:08,450 --> 01:20:12,020
you are coming with us, brother. You coming with us, brother.

1267
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:17,280
Now, both of your parents have passed,

1268
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:20,320
I guess you know that, but your sisters,

1269
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:23,770
Janet and Kim, will be waiting for us...

1270
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:29,850
when we land, brother.

1271
01:20:35,030 --> 01:20:37,270
You goin' home, Blood.

1272
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:42,770
You're goin' home, Blood.

1273
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:50,180
Come on, now.

1274
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:11,350
Blessed holy God.

1275
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:16,310
We come around your mighty throne of grace...

1276
01:21:17,530 --> 01:21:19,520
to thank you for this day.

1277
01:21:23,530 --> 01:21:28,560
We thank you for the reunion of family... and friendship...

1278
01:21:30,700 --> 01:21:31,720
and the brotherhood.

1279
01:21:35,070 --> 01:21:39,770
Continuing in prayer, Lord, we ask you for traveling grace...

1280
01:21:40,780 --> 01:21:42,100
and the mending of hearts.

1281
01:21:43,860 --> 01:21:46,310
In your son's righteous and holy name, we pray.

1283
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:49,140
- Amen. - Amen.

1284
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:52,890
Damn! What is that sound?

1285
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:56,350
Uh, cicadas.

1286
01:21:57,900 --> 01:21:59,890
- Cicadas? - Yeah.

1287
01:22:01,070 --> 01:22:02,520
They don't sound like that back home.

1288
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:05,600
We ain't home, son.

1289
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:09,220
We ain't home.

1290
01:22:39,570 --> 01:22:41,180
- You all right? - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1291
01:22:51,950 --> 01:22:54,270
Hey, son, get this off of me, man.

1292
01:23:01,490 --> 01:23:02,150
All right. I got it.

1293
01:23:02,150 --> 01:23:03,430
Just let it drop. Let it go.

1294
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:07,770
Hand me my water, man.

1295
01:23:10,530 --> 01:23:11,280
Hydrate.

1296
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:12,770
- Lord have mercy. - My man.

1297
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:17,390
Hey, I can manage another 30, 40 pounds.

1298
01:23:17,740 --> 01:23:19,220
- Yeah. - That be just great, bud.

1299
01:23:19,490 --> 01:23:22,850
My son play the pack mule, my son gets a fair share.

1300
01:23:24,650 --> 01:23:27,270
- It's fine, Dad. It's fine. - No, the hell it is.

1301
01:23:27,740 --> 01:23:30,530
When did you turn into a grade-A, first-rate, certified,

1302
01:23:30,530 --> 01:23:32,520
old, tired and crazy motherfucker?

1303
01:23:32,530 --> 01:23:33,640
Ah, fuck you, man.

1304
01:23:35,860 --> 01:23:38,020
When you've been cheated in life as much as I have,

1305
01:23:38,950 --> 01:23:42,310
you learn to spot the sign of all them dirty rat bastards out there.

1306
01:23:43,070 --> 01:23:44,430
How much you need, huh?

1307
01:23:47,450 --> 01:23:49,360
That enough? You want more?

1308
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:50,570
Man, get that out of my fucking face.

1309
01:23:50,570 --> 01:23:52,020
Get that out of my fucking face.

1310
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:54,180
Do you remember?

1311
01:23:56,700 --> 01:23:58,680
You remember what Norm said about money?

1312
01:24:02,070 --> 01:24:03,020
I don't remember that.

1313
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:10,640
No, no, no. I am sick and tired

1314
01:24:10,900 --> 01:24:14,020
of trying to get you fools to love one another.

1315
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:18,100
Go ahead! You wanna tear each other apart, go on. Go on!

1316
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:20,100
Here I thought...

1317
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:24,310
I hoped that we could be Bloods one more time.

1318
01:24:24,780 --> 01:24:27,270
But, no, that ain't gonna never happen again because of this.

1319
01:24:28,820 --> 01:24:33,560
Traded brotherhood for this shit. Right, Paul?

1320
01:24:33,570 --> 01:24:35,600
That motherfucker walks backward pigeon-toed.

1321
01:24:35,610 --> 01:24:39,350
"Eddie, you black as a damn crow ain't white like snow

1322
01:24:39,530 --> 01:24:40,680
And if you didn't know

1323
01:24:40,990 --> 01:24:43,430
If you ain't got no dough, then you don't go

1324
01:24:43,450 --> 01:24:44,890
And that's for damn sure"

1325
01:24:46,070 --> 01:24:49,020
Yeah, well, my mama told me...

1326
01:24:49,860 --> 01:24:53,600
that money is the root of all--

1327
01:24:54,490 --> 01:24:55,430
Oh, shit!

1328
01:24:56,780 --> 01:24:58,640
- Oh, my God! - What the fuck?

1329
01:25:02,860 --> 01:25:03,330
Eddie.

1330
01:25:03,330 --> 01:25:05,400
- Fuck. - Oh! What?

1331
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:07,570
- Otis, don't move! It's a minefield! - Eddie!

1332
01:25:07,570 --> 01:25:08,890
It's a minefield!

1333
01:25:10,110 --> 01:25:11,180
Don't move, Otis.

1334
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:20,140
Okay, okay, okay.

1335
01:25:21,650 --> 01:25:25,560
I got you. I got you. I got you.

1336
01:25:25,990 --> 01:25:28,430
I got you. I got you.

1337
01:25:31,900 --> 01:25:34,180
- I got you. - Bloods.

1338
01:25:48,900 --> 01:25:49,720
Jesus!

1339
01:25:52,900 --> 01:25:54,150
- Jesus! - What?

1340
01:25:54,150 --> 01:25:57,140
Jesus! Dad! Dad! I think I stepped on something.

1341
01:25:57,740 --> 01:25:59,780
- Stay right there. - Motherfucker!

1342
01:25:59,780 --> 01:26:01,770
David, don't move. Don't move.

1343
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:06,060
David!

1344
01:26:07,570 --> 01:26:09,350
- Everybody freeze! - Everybody okay?

1345
01:26:09,700 --> 01:26:13,350
Dad, no, no! Put it down! Put it down! They can help!

1346
01:26:13,820 --> 01:26:17,270
- We were just walking back to our camp. - He stepped on something.

1347
01:26:17,490 --> 01:26:20,720
- Is it a pressure plate? - Well, if it was, he would be dead.

1348
01:26:20,740 --> 01:26:24,400
Uh, maybe it's a dud. Or maybe it's not.

1349
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:26,520
- We can help you. - Look! Look! He can help.

1350
01:26:31,030 --> 01:26:32,020
Okay, come on.

1351
01:26:38,030 --> 01:26:41,270
And, David... don't move.

1352
01:26:42,450 --> 01:26:43,890
What are we gonna do about my son?

1353
01:26:44,530 --> 01:26:46,320
Well, all he can do is lift up his foot

1354
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:48,310
and pray to God it doesn't explode.

1355
01:26:50,030 --> 01:26:51,850
There's gotta be something else we can do.

1356
01:26:53,070 --> 01:26:54,520
Well, if there is, I don't know it.

1357
01:26:54,700 --> 01:26:57,970
Fuck. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1358
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:02,270
Jethro Bodine.

1359
01:27:02,650 --> 01:27:04,390
- What? - Who?

1360
01:27:04,950 --> 01:27:07,140
Remember that big ol' hillbilly kid from Oklahoma?

1361
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:09,680
He stepped on a toe popper. Remember?

1362
01:27:09,740 --> 01:27:11,600
- Yeah. Yeah. - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1363
01:27:11,950 --> 01:27:13,520
Okay, we're gonna spring my son...

1364
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:16,970
the same way we sprung that hillbilly kid, you got me?

1365
01:27:17,570 --> 01:27:18,970
Yeah, that'll work. That'll work.

1366
01:27:19,650 --> 01:27:20,470
Give me that rope.

1367
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:28,310
Where am I walking? Where am I walking?

1368
01:27:28,740 --> 01:27:30,850
Straight to me, I swept it. You're good. You're good.

1369
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:38,220
Do us both a favor. Don't fucking shift your weight, okay?

1370
01:27:38,700 --> 01:27:39,930
Stay right where you are.

1371
01:27:40,030 --> 01:27:43,520
David, I want you to take this rope.

1372
01:27:44,700 --> 01:27:49,640
I want you to wrap this rope around your body. Two times.

1373
01:27:49,820 --> 01:27:53,390
Go ahead. Twice around your body.

1374
01:27:53,780 --> 01:27:57,350
Go on, like that. There you go.

1375
01:27:59,490 --> 01:28:03,810
High as you can, man. High as you can. Right.

1376
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:33,560
David look at me. Where did you go to college?

1377
01:28:36,610 --> 01:28:38,560
- The House. - The House.

1378
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:40,640
Who went to The House?

1379
01:28:43,110 --> 01:28:46,110
- Come on. - Edwin Moses. The class of '78.

1380
01:28:46,110 --> 01:28:49,190
- Come on. What he'd do? - Won two Olympic gold medals.

1381
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:50,970
- Yeah. - Four hundred meter hurdles.

1382
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:55,310
He took 13 steps between each hurdle. Everybody else took 15.

1383
01:28:57,150 --> 01:29:01,100
David, that man could fly.

1384
01:29:02,900 --> 01:29:03,930
What you gonna do?

1385
01:29:05,950 --> 01:29:07,470
- What you gonna do, David? - Fly.

1386
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:10,180
- Like? - Fly like Moses.

1387
01:29:16,070 --> 01:29:18,220
I want everybody to take a piece of this rope.

1388
01:29:18,700 --> 01:29:22,060
Back on up. Otis, back on up.

1389
01:29:23,110 --> 01:29:26,520
Back it on up, man. You, too, Mel. Back it on up.

1390
01:29:26,900 --> 01:29:27,520
All right.

1391
01:29:34,900 --> 01:29:36,520
- Here, take this. - That's good, big man.

1392
01:29:36,950 --> 01:29:38,780
That's good, big man! Right there. Yeah.

1393
01:29:38,780 --> 01:29:40,150
Fuck. Fuck.

1394
01:29:40,150 --> 01:29:42,310
- Get that slack! - Tighten up!

1395
01:29:45,990 --> 01:29:49,270
Now, everybody...

1396
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:53,390
you get an armful and a handful of rope.

1397
01:29:56,450 --> 01:29:57,810
- We good? - We good.

1398
01:29:58,150 --> 01:29:59,100
I hear you.

1399
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:03,720
On count of three, you pull harder than a motherfucker!

1400
01:30:03,740 --> 01:30:04,640
Yeah, baby.

1401
01:30:05,610 --> 01:30:06,440
You got me?

1402
01:30:06,450 --> 01:30:07,560
- We got you, Blood. - Got you.

1403
01:30:08,240 --> 01:30:09,020
All right.

1404
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:14,060
One...

1405
01:30:15,650 --> 01:30:16,560
two...

1406
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:19,140
three!

1407
01:30:20,570 --> 01:30:21,430
Come on, man.

1408
01:30:27,110 --> 01:30:28,060
God is great.

1409
01:30:30,570 --> 01:30:31,270
Okay.

1410
01:30:38,570 --> 01:30:40,020
All right. Now...

1411
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:42,680
What the fuck?

1412
01:30:43,490 --> 01:30:46,940
- Get on your knees. Get on your fucking knees. - If you get...

1413
01:30:46,950 --> 01:30:49,520
- Dad. - Put that damn gun down now!

1414
01:30:49,610 --> 01:30:50,850
We're compromised, Melvin.

1415
01:30:51,530 --> 01:30:54,470
Okay, okay, okay. Just take it easy now.

1416
01:30:54,570 --> 01:30:57,020
You know, whatever you're doing, it's none of our business.

1417
01:30:57,020 --> 01:30:58,070
We can just go.

1418
01:30:58,070 --> 01:31:01,520
Otis, the sound of those blasts traveled, man.

1419
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:03,810
Somebody is on their way here right now.

1420
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:06,490
- We gotta get the gold and get outta here. - You serious?

1421
01:31:06,490 --> 01:31:08,570
- We gotta get somebody for Eddie, Dad. - Hey, man.

1422
01:31:08,570 --> 01:31:10,060
American Embassy. Somebody.

1423
01:31:10,150 --> 01:31:14,070
- We can't tell nobody nothing. - Just slow the fuck down, man.

1424
01:31:14,070 --> 01:31:15,360
We have to bury Eddie.

1425
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:18,020
Are you deaf, man? Are you deaf? Are you deaf?

1426
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:19,940
We gotta get out of here, Otis!

1427
01:31:19,950 --> 01:31:22,390
- I'm not leaving Eddie like that! - I can be helpful to you.

1428
01:31:22,900 --> 01:31:25,930
You can be helpful? Okay.

1429
01:31:27,650 --> 01:31:28,770
Can you bring back the dead?

1430
01:31:31,610 --> 01:31:34,320
- Get the rope, tie 'em up. - Not doing it.

1431
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:35,680
Let's just talk about it.

1432
01:31:35,820 --> 01:31:39,100
Otis, you ain't giving the orders, man. I'm running shit now.

1433
01:31:42,490 --> 01:31:44,140
Dad! Dad!

1434
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:47,970
Dad nothing. Dad nothing. Dad nothing!

1435
01:31:52,700 --> 01:31:55,390
Boy, I've killed far better men than you,

1436
01:31:55,780 --> 01:32:00,060
and I will not hesitate to plug a hole in you right now.

1437
01:32:01,650 --> 01:32:04,390
David, tie 'em up.

1438
01:32:08,070 --> 01:32:11,930
You want your share? Tie 'em up.

1439
01:32:13,150 --> 01:32:14,520
You wanna remain my son?

1440
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:20,850
Get at it. Get at it.

1441
01:32:26,360 --> 01:32:27,970
Come here, son. Come here. Come here.

1442
01:32:29,610 --> 01:32:31,270
- All right. - Give me your hand.

1443
01:32:35,240 --> 01:32:36,310
You had me fooled.

1444
01:32:44,950 --> 01:32:46,140
You got something to say?

1445
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:50,470
You say it to me. Not my son.

1446
01:32:58,490 --> 01:32:59,640
Let me tell y'all something.

1447
01:33:00,530 --> 01:33:01,810
I'm the motherfucker.

1448
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:06,150
I... am the motherfucker.

1449
01:33:06,150 --> 01:33:09,390
I'm the motherfucker. I'm the motherfucker.

1450
01:33:16,820 --> 01:33:18,020
So long, Blood.

1451
01:33:19,820 --> 01:33:20,930
Rest in power.

1452
01:33:23,610 --> 01:33:24,640
Amen.

1453
01:33:25,490 --> 01:33:26,470
- Amen. - Amen.

1454
01:33:30,610 --> 01:33:32,520
We should give Eddie's share to his family.

1455
01:33:34,700 --> 01:33:36,060
It's the right thing to do, y'all.

1456
01:33:39,740 --> 01:33:40,560
And David?

1457
01:33:43,900 --> 01:33:46,180
That's my boy. He deserves a fair share.

1458
01:33:50,240 --> 01:33:50,930
Deal?

1459
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:54,850
- Deal. - All right.

1460
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:26,970
I can't believe I was actually...

1461
01:34:27,950 --> 01:34:30,100
jealous of you, back at that bar.

1462
01:34:31,030 --> 01:34:34,850
Yeah. You seemed so fuckin' sure of yourself.

1463
01:34:35,700 --> 01:34:40,640
Should've known you're actually just a spineless fucking rat.

1464
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:43,850
Hedy, you can't still want this guy.

1465
01:34:44,030 --> 01:34:45,820
Look at him, his father's gonna kill us.

1466
01:34:45,820 --> 01:34:47,100
Seppo, shut up.

1467
01:34:47,860 --> 01:34:50,430
Well, your father scares me more than landmines.

1468
01:34:50,860 --> 01:34:52,560
Shut the hell up, up there.

1469
01:34:57,030 --> 01:34:58,930
- Yeah, over here. - Here?

1470
01:35:01,320 --> 01:35:03,270
Take us about a day, and we get to...

1471
01:35:09,650 --> 01:35:13,310
You be careful with this OxyContin shit. It can be addictive.

1472
01:35:20,450 --> 01:35:23,310
Where were we? What about right here?

1473
01:35:23,950 --> 01:35:25,520
But I think that Vinh should--

1474
01:35:26,780 --> 01:35:29,720
Vinh is out. He in cahoots with Charlie.

1475
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:33,430
Ain't that right, traitor?

1476
01:35:37,030 --> 01:35:38,850
If you don't trust me by now...

1477
01:35:40,740 --> 01:35:44,430
just shoot me... when you kill them.

1478
01:35:54,200 --> 01:35:55,310
What the hell is that?

1479
01:35:55,990 --> 01:36:00,770
Night vision, baby. Night vision. Let's see what's shaking.

1480
01:36:04,510 --> 01:36:06,540
I need to urinate.

1481
01:36:07,350 --> 01:36:10,830
- She needs to pee. - Yeah, I heard her. I'm not deaf.

1482
01:36:11,150 --> 01:36:13,820
Yeah, I know the Geneva Convention's off the table,

1483
01:36:13,820 --> 01:36:15,720
but maybe just let her take a piss.

1484
01:36:16,390 --> 01:36:20,430
Well, could you untie my hands? Please.

1485
01:36:20,430 --> 01:36:21,940
You gotta go, you gotta go.

1486
01:36:25,470 --> 01:36:26,710
Fast, all right?

1488
01:36:35,890 --> 01:36:36,460
To the tree.

1490
01:36:40,700 --> 01:36:45,070
David, don't you want the first time I unzip and remove my pants

1491
01:36:45,070 --> 01:36:47,400
to be under better circumstances?

1492
01:36:53,970 --> 01:36:55,910
Were you flirting with me the other night

1493
01:36:55,910 --> 01:36:58,710
because you were looking for an easy fuck

1494
01:36:58,920 --> 01:37:01,490
or because you were actually interested in me?

1495
01:37:01,860 --> 01:37:03,570
Actually, I'm interested.

1496
01:37:08,820 --> 01:37:11,780
Yeah. You left your wealthy family behind

1497
01:37:11,780 --> 01:37:15,010
to do something good, help people, kids.

1498
01:37:17,610 --> 01:37:20,500
And you're fine, too. I ain't gonna lie.

1499
01:37:22,510 --> 01:37:24,300
Then let me go.

1500
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:31,120
Give me a ten-minute head start. All I ask, please?

1501
01:37:34,120 --> 01:37:38,740
You know, I hate to cockblock. She cute, though.

1502
01:37:40,610 --> 01:37:42,280
Mel, take her back to the tree.

1503
01:37:43,320 --> 01:37:45,380
You better listen to your pop, son.

1504
01:37:45,460 --> 01:37:48,090
You're a worthless fuck. Just so you know,

1505
01:37:48,090 --> 01:37:49,400
I was only trying to escape.

1506
01:37:49,400 --> 01:37:51,770
I wouldn't fuck you for all the gold in the world.

1509
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:17,950
Just what I thought. Just what I thought.

1510
01:38:25,640 --> 01:38:28,160
Mel, you make sure that rope is tight.

1511
01:38:28,160 --> 01:38:30,190
- Oh, yeah. - Hey, Dad.

1512
01:38:30,640 --> 01:38:32,050
Okay. Okay.

1513
01:38:32,610 --> 01:38:33,680
- God damn! - Get the gun!

1514
01:38:33,680 --> 01:38:35,490
- God damn! - I got the gun.

1515
01:38:35,490 --> 01:38:38,050
Drag his ass over there. Drag his ass over there.

1516
01:38:38,050 --> 01:38:39,710
- Seppo's loose! Give me the gun! - Get him.

1517
01:38:39,710 --> 01:38:41,420
I'll crack your head open!

1518
01:38:45,010 --> 01:38:47,100
I knew it! I knew it!

1519
01:38:48,190 --> 01:38:52,410
Another motherfucking dope fiend double-cross.

1520
01:38:52,890 --> 01:38:55,800
David, you don't see what Otis is doing?

1521
01:38:56,130 --> 01:38:59,560
You're playin' into his fuckin' hands!

1522
01:39:00,420 --> 01:39:03,650
Your dear mother would be ashamed of you!

1523
01:39:04,760 --> 01:39:08,560
Yeah, you ain't no fuckin' son of mine!

1524
01:39:09,090 --> 01:39:10,910
You're dead to me. You hear me?

1525
01:39:10,910 --> 01:39:13,190
- Get the rope. - Gone! Buried!

1526
01:39:13,190 --> 01:39:15,300
- Get the rope. - You're a fucking coward.

1527
01:39:15,300 --> 01:39:17,700
- Fucking disgrace! - Get the rope! Get the rope, David.

1528
01:39:17,700 --> 01:39:20,710
Don't get shit. You stay your ass right the fuck there.

1529
01:39:20,710 --> 01:39:24,620
You stay your ass right the fuck there!

1530
01:39:48,450 --> 01:39:50,440
You've had quite an adventure.

1531
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:53,640
- My friend, let me help. - Oh, no.

1532
01:39:53,640 --> 01:39:56,400
I got it, I got it. Thank you. Thank you, I got it.

1533
01:40:08,780 --> 01:40:10,530
- Get this off of me. - Where's Eddie?

1534
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:15,960
Broke his ankle. We left him with food and water.

1535
01:40:20,030 --> 01:40:21,630
He insisted.

1536
01:40:23,260 --> 01:40:25,650
That boy is stubborn as an old mule.

1537
01:40:29,900 --> 01:40:32,020
- Sounds very bad. - Yeah.

1538
01:40:32,020 --> 01:40:34,060
I knew you should not have gone alone.

1539
01:40:35,140 --> 01:40:38,070
I have a friend in the district. He'll send a rescue group.

1540
01:40:38,620 --> 01:40:39,800
How would you like to earn more money

1541
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:41,960
than you ever earned in your whole life?

1542
01:40:47,710 --> 01:40:49,650
Eddie didn't break an ankle, did he?

1543
01:40:51,670 --> 01:40:53,490
No. Help me.

1544
01:40:55,350 --> 01:40:56,460
You kill him?

1545
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:58,470
Oh, God, no.

1546
01:41:00,460 --> 01:41:01,760
Minefield.

1547
01:41:02,150 --> 01:41:03,330
Otis!

1548
01:41:03,560 --> 01:41:04,960
Here come your partners.

1549
01:41:09,900 --> 01:41:11,500
Ain't no partners of mine.

1550
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:12,750
Hedy!

1551
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:15,470
- Hedy! - Seppo!

1552
01:41:15,470 --> 01:41:17,020
Seppo! Seppo!

1554
01:41:25,390 --> 01:41:26,530
He said you have his gold.

1556
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:28,970
Forget that.

1557
01:41:30,390 --> 01:41:33,090
We trade your friend for gold.

1558
01:41:33,100 --> 01:41:33,980
He ain't our friend!

1559
01:41:33,980 --> 01:41:35,690
- What? - You heard me.

1560
01:41:35,690 --> 01:41:38,580
Hedy, for God's sakes, help me.

1561
01:41:38,580 --> 01:41:40,640
David, you've got to help him.

1562
01:41:41,160 --> 01:41:42,150
Otis?

1563
01:41:43,650 --> 01:41:44,520
Please.

1564
01:41:49,260 --> 01:41:51,180
We want him alive.

1565
01:42:03,570 --> 01:42:05,230
- Fuck! - Fuck.

1566
01:42:07,960 --> 01:42:09,220
We can share.

1567
01:42:10,580 --> 01:42:12,570
There's enough for everybody.

1570
01:42:17,700 --> 01:42:19,190
What's he saying?

1571
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:20,820
I like you.

1572
01:42:21,180 --> 01:42:25,920
Black Uncle Sam. We share.

1573
01:42:27,050 --> 01:42:30,050
This for you, rest for us.

1574
01:42:30,050 --> 01:42:31,940
Look, man, we're Americans, all right?

1575
01:42:31,940 --> 01:42:34,090
You kill us or hurt him,

1576
01:42:34,210 --> 01:42:35,730
you got an international fiasco on your hands.

1577
01:42:35,730 --> 01:42:39,300
We're not gonna kill anyone... yet.

1578
01:42:40,360 --> 01:42:41,290
You heard him.

1579
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:44,290
Nobody gets nothing. Nothing!

1580
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:50,240
Black Uncle Sam, this is belong to Vietnamese people.

1581
01:42:50,550 --> 01:42:51,760
We take what is ours.

1582
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:53,530
Hey, boy, you ain't taking what's ours.

1583
01:42:53,530 --> 01:42:58,040
You look on that gold bar right there, it says USA, my friend.

1584
01:42:58,040 --> 01:43:00,110
You, USA?

1585
01:43:00,110 --> 01:43:01,450
Damn skippy.

1586
01:43:02,240 --> 01:43:05,800
- It say USA, but I don't think so. - Well, you better believe it.

1587
01:43:06,350 --> 01:43:08,070
Who the fuck are you, man?

1588
01:43:08,740 --> 01:43:10,640
- We? - Uh-huh. You.

1589
01:43:10,640 --> 01:43:11,900
Vietnam officer.

1590
01:43:11,910 --> 01:43:14,710
Oh, yeah? Where are your official badges?

1591
01:43:16,500 --> 01:43:19,100
We don't need no stinkin' official badges.

1592
01:43:20,690 --> 01:43:22,870
Do you know Calley, brother?

1593
01:43:24,890 --> 01:43:28,060
Yeah. And first of all, you ain't my brother,

1594
01:43:28,520 --> 01:43:30,690
and I know California, yeah.

1595
01:43:31,020 --> 01:43:32,980
You imbecile.

1596
01:43:33,140 --> 01:43:34,860
It's not a state.

1598
01:43:35,240 --> 01:43:38,900
Lt. Calley. Ever heard of My Lai?

1599
01:43:40,170 --> 01:43:41,990
I know all about My Lai.

1600
01:43:41,990 --> 01:43:44,990
And you, GI murder,

1601
01:43:45,370 --> 01:43:49,030
killer of innocent children and babies.

1602
01:43:49,030 --> 01:43:51,050
There were atrocities on both sides.

1603
01:43:51,050 --> 01:43:53,090
So why don't you go chew on some motherfucking chopsticks?

1604
01:43:53,100 --> 01:43:55,240
- Chill, chill, chill. - No, no, fuck him!

1605
01:44:01,650 --> 01:44:04,060
"Make America great again."

1606
01:44:05,100 --> 01:44:06,420
I show you something!

1607
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
- Simon! - Oh, fuck!

1608
01:44:25,070 --> 01:44:26,780
Chavy! Chavy!

1609
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:29,200
- Simon! - Stay down!

1610
01:44:29,770 --> 01:44:30,890
Come on! Come on!

1611
01:44:40,690 --> 01:44:41,900
Chavy!

1612
01:45:04,630 --> 01:45:05,780
Where's Norm?

1613
01:45:06,250 --> 01:45:08,560
He's gone, man. KIA.

1614
01:45:09,370 --> 01:45:11,350
Đi đi mau! Let's move.

1615
01:45:11,350 --> 01:45:12,870
- Go ahead. Go ahead! - Đi đi mau!

1616
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:14,600
Go ahead. I got this.

1617
01:45:19,620 --> 01:45:21,330
Okay. All right, okay.

1618
01:45:21,810 --> 01:45:23,110
- Mel! - Yeah, man.

1619
01:45:23,120 --> 01:45:24,580
- Bring a first aid kit. - Yeah.

1620
01:45:24,580 --> 01:45:26,000
And a satellite phone.

1621
01:45:28,200 --> 01:45:29,610
He's just gone!

1622
01:45:30,170 --> 01:45:32,730
- Otis. - All right. Roll over. Roll over.

1623
01:45:32,730 --> 01:45:35,320
Turn... I know, turn over. Turn over.

1624
01:45:35,800 --> 01:45:37,060
Clean through and through.

1625
01:45:39,550 --> 01:45:41,630
- Press this on. Press it down. - Seppo.

1626
01:45:41,630 --> 01:45:45,970
I know, boy. I know. There you go. All right.

1627
01:45:46,150 --> 01:45:47,650
Just keep the pressure on.

1628
01:45:48,620 --> 01:45:51,490
Breathe through it. Just breathe through it. Keep on going.

1629
01:45:51,500 --> 01:45:55,220
Keep on. All right. Press this. Press this on.

1630
01:45:55,460 --> 01:45:58,600
Here we go. Press it on. Press it on!

1631
01:45:58,820 --> 01:46:01,980
Press it. Press it tight. All right, I know. I know. I know.

1632
01:46:01,980 --> 01:46:04,710
I know, come on. All right, you got this.

1633
01:46:04,850 --> 01:46:07,660
Move your hand! I know.

1634
01:46:08,090 --> 01:46:10,720
There you go. Man, it's gotta be tight.

1635
01:46:15,670 --> 01:46:17,100
Clean through and through.

1636
01:46:20,350 --> 01:46:22,220
There you go. Hold on.

1637
01:46:22,220 --> 01:46:24,600
Straighten up! Straighten up!

1638
01:46:27,250 --> 01:46:30,390
All right. All right, hold on. It's all right.

1639
01:46:30,390 --> 01:46:31,420
How he doin'?

1640
01:46:31,500 --> 01:46:34,890
- You'll survive. You'll survive. - How's he doing, man?

1641
01:46:35,880 --> 01:46:37,820
That's nothing but a mosquito bite.

1642
01:46:37,820 --> 01:46:40,050
- Don't fuck it up, man. - Come on. Come on.

1643
01:46:43,050 --> 01:46:44,320
Man the hell up.

1644
01:46:45,060 --> 01:46:48,060
- All right. All right. All right. - Okay, look...

1645
01:46:49,610 --> 01:46:52,980
First thing that gook's gonna do when he gets back to town,

1646
01:46:53,490 --> 01:46:58,540
he gonna round up all the local muscle he can. Now look.

1647
01:46:59,800 --> 01:47:00,860
Who you callin'?

1648
01:47:01,140 --> 01:47:04,180
I'm calling Tiên. She can get us out of here.

1649
01:47:05,730 --> 01:47:07,910
- What the fuck you do that for? - What the fuck...

1650
01:47:08,030 --> 01:47:10,640
- I should shoot your crazy ass dead. - Do it.

1651
01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:16,530
Ain't nothing to it but to do it, Blood.

1652
01:47:17,230 --> 01:47:18,800
Don't tempt me, motherfucker.

1653
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:21,610
What the fuck is wrong with you guys?

1654
01:47:22,360 --> 01:47:23,250
Brother.

1655
01:47:27,500 --> 01:47:29,450
We have very little gas left.

1656
01:47:29,870 --> 01:47:33,200
Perhaps enough gas to get to the temple ruin.

1657
01:47:33,200 --> 01:47:35,590
- A few miles from here. - What do we achieve by that, huh?

1658
01:47:36,910 --> 01:47:40,140
If you wanna choose to fight these men, you need some defenses.

1659
01:47:40,830 --> 01:47:42,980
Otis, try doing the math, huh?

1660
01:47:43,420 --> 01:47:46,210
Tiên is with the V.C.

1661
01:47:46,520 --> 01:47:49,430
Otis, that's how they knew about the gold, man.

1662
01:47:49,430 --> 01:47:54,380
That's how this whole fucking ambush was a setup! Mel?

1663
01:47:54,380 --> 01:47:55,550
You know Tiên?

1664
01:47:56,420 --> 01:47:57,600
No, I do not.

1665
01:47:57,840 --> 01:47:59,720
And you expect him to tell the truth.

1666
01:48:00,770 --> 01:48:04,580
Okay, look here. Look here, man. Okay.

1667
01:48:05,250 --> 01:48:07,720
We gonna cut through the jungle to a river.

1668
01:48:08,660 --> 01:48:13,160
To a village, Hng Ng. Right there, Hng Ng.

1669
01:48:13,650 --> 01:48:16,410
Wait till nightfall. We gonna rip off a boat,

1670
01:48:16,420 --> 01:48:18,500
and then we skirt past Tan Chau.

1671
01:48:18,500 --> 01:48:20,610
- Hey, guys! No! - Tan Chau.

1672
01:48:20,890 --> 01:48:23,810
We can't go there. That's 20 miles away from here.

1673
01:48:23,810 --> 01:48:26,860
So what? You scared of a little bit of exercise, fat boy? Huh?

1674
01:48:27,620 --> 01:48:29,620
David's leg won't handle that.

1675
01:48:29,630 --> 01:48:33,090
David ain't my problem... anymore.

1676
01:48:33,090 --> 01:48:34,820
Man, David is your son.

1677
01:48:35,180 --> 01:48:36,260
My son...

1678
01:48:41,250 --> 01:48:42,830
is a backstabber.

1679
01:48:51,770 --> 01:48:53,180
Are you with us or not?

1680
01:48:55,240 --> 01:48:56,560
My share is my share.

1681
01:48:56,560 --> 01:48:59,340
You do what you want with his share. Hear me?

1682
01:49:01,050 --> 01:49:03,280
Listen, you crazy fuck!

1683
01:49:04,270 --> 01:49:06,040
Norman wouldn't want us to split up.

1684
01:49:06,040 --> 01:49:08,160
That's right. He wouldn't.

1685
01:49:09,560 --> 01:49:14,220
And that's my problem. Ah. That's my problem, Otis.

1686
01:49:14,890 --> 01:49:19,860
Stormin' Norm ain't with the living. You feel me?

1687
01:49:21,950 --> 01:49:23,120
My problem.

1688
01:49:29,350 --> 01:49:30,530
Peace out!

1690
01:49:58,710 --> 01:50:02,170
"The Lord is my shepherd! I shall not want!

1691
01:50:02,170 --> 01:50:05,420
He maketh me lie down in green pastures!

1692
01:50:05,420 --> 01:50:10,460
He leadeth me beside the still waters! He restoreth my soul!

1693
01:50:10,460 --> 01:50:16,620
He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for His name's sake!

1694
01:50:16,720 --> 01:50:20,350
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,

1695
01:50:20,350 --> 01:50:24,150
I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me.

1696
01:50:24,150 --> 01:50:30,220
Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me!"

1697
01:50:53,980 --> 01:50:56,300
I can help you get it out of the country.

1698
01:51:00,930 --> 01:51:04,560
- All right. We'll give you a share. - How much is that?

1699
01:51:07,500 --> 01:51:08,410
Million.

1700
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:11,130
We want in, too.

1701
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:14,200
- You want in? - Yeah.

1702
01:51:15,890 --> 01:51:16,750
All right.

1703
01:51:16,750 --> 01:51:19,650
Damn, Otis. Just put the gold on Craigslist.

1704
01:51:19,770 --> 01:51:22,710
Mel, what am I supposed to do, huh? Eddie, Simon,

1705
01:51:22,710 --> 01:51:24,080
that bullshit with Paul

1706
01:51:24,080 --> 01:51:26,030
and the kidnapping never happened, all right?

1707
01:51:26,030 --> 01:51:27,480
And what about Seppo?

1708
01:51:27,480 --> 01:51:30,990
We all know what happened to Seppo. He stepped on a landmine.

1709
01:51:32,190 --> 01:51:35,210
Hey, so real quick, just for our edification.

1710
01:51:35,570 --> 01:51:38,210
Our share is also gonna be a million?

1711
01:51:40,060 --> 01:51:44,500
Shit!

1712
01:51:45,150 --> 01:51:46,220
Half.

1713
01:51:50,410 --> 01:51:54,650
They ain't snatching my gold. Not me. No, sir. Not this time.

1714
01:51:54,650 --> 01:51:56,200
I ain't getting fucked again.

1715
01:51:56,290 --> 01:51:58,530
Trying to fuck me with salt in the Vaseline.

1726
01:52:49,690 --> 01:52:54,880
I dedicate this next record to brother Marvin Gaye

1727
01:52:55,200 --> 01:52:59,560
and to the soul brothers of the 1st Infantry Divisions.

1728
01:52:59,680 --> 01:53:04,730
Big Red One, 2nd Battalion, 136th Regiment.

1729
01:53:05,950 --> 01:53:08,030
Have a good day, gentlemen.

1730
01:55:10,040 --> 01:55:13,280
Their mind's weak. They got no intestinal fortitude.

1731
01:55:15,450 --> 01:55:18,540
Ain't as strong as Paul. No, no, sir.

1732
01:55:18,890 --> 01:55:21,830
Ain't got the guts Paul got. It ain't their fault.

1733
01:55:23,230 --> 01:55:26,900
They was born weak. Otis and his ho.

1734
01:55:27,990 --> 01:55:32,620
Car thieves, guttersnipes, chain snatchers.

1735
01:55:34,110 --> 01:55:39,100
They ain't snatching... my gold bars.

1736
01:55:40,270 --> 01:55:42,840
Not Paul. No, sir.

1737
01:55:43,870 --> 01:55:45,560
I ain't getting fucked again.

1738
01:55:45,920 --> 01:55:48,970
Trying to fuck me with that salt in the Vaseline.

1739
01:55:52,390 --> 01:55:55,170
Not Paul. Not this time.

1740
01:55:57,140 --> 01:55:57,960
No.

1741
01:55:59,330 --> 01:56:04,980
Them son of bitches. Son of bitches. Son of...

1742
01:56:06,600 --> 01:56:08,210
Turned my own son against me.

1743
01:56:14,180 --> 01:56:15,350
My own blood.

1744
01:56:16,550 --> 01:56:17,900
God damn.

1745
01:56:20,330 --> 01:56:21,170
Well...

1746
01:56:23,720 --> 01:56:25,860
we gonna see who's standing in the end.

1747
01:56:26,990 --> 01:56:32,110
I don't care what the VA say. VA don't know shit from Shinola.

1748
01:56:32,140 --> 01:56:36,830
Worst fucking doctors in the world. Malignancy? Shit.

1749
01:56:39,450 --> 01:56:41,470
You made me malignant.

1750
01:56:43,780 --> 01:56:45,910
This fucking place here...

1751
01:56:50,230 --> 01:56:55,270
bathed me in that lymphoma Agent Orange herbicidal stew.

1752
01:56:55,270 --> 01:56:57,600
Those army bastards, they scorched the earth with it.

1753
01:56:57,600 --> 01:57:00,090
Sprayed that shit in the air and the water,

1754
01:57:00,100 --> 01:57:05,130
my bloodstream, my cells, my DNA, and my motherfucking soul!

1755
01:57:07,410 --> 01:57:08,710
But I ain't dying...

1756
01:57:09,830 --> 01:57:11,140
from that shit.

1757
01:57:13,050 --> 01:57:14,430
You will not...

1758
01:57:15,480 --> 01:57:17,000
kill Paul.

1759
01:57:17,910 --> 01:57:19,080
You hear me?

1760
01:57:24,290 --> 01:57:25,390
Hear me.

1761
01:57:28,830 --> 01:57:32,290
You will not kill Paul.

1762
01:57:34,290 --> 01:57:37,200
And the US government will not take me out.

1763
01:57:39,990 --> 01:57:41,560
I will choose

1764
01:57:42,570 --> 01:57:43,420
when...

1765
01:57:45,370 --> 01:57:47,930
and how I die.

1766
01:57:49,110 --> 01:57:50,290
You dig?

1767
01:57:51,250 --> 01:57:55,010
You couldn't kill me then, with three tours,

1768
01:57:55,370 --> 01:57:59,170
you sure in the fuck can't kill me now.

1769
01:58:00,880 --> 01:58:01,750
Right on?

1770
01:58:05,760 --> 01:58:06,700
Right on.

1771
01:58:12,970 --> 01:58:14,000
Right on.

1772
01:58:19,120 --> 01:58:21,130
Right on.

1773
01:58:42,560 --> 01:58:45,780
- I know that thing is throbbing like hell. - Yeah.

1774
01:58:51,850 --> 01:58:52,800
Thanks.

1775
01:58:53,370 --> 01:58:56,650
Don't thank me. Thank your Uncle Meli-Mel.

1776
01:58:57,810 --> 01:58:59,210
You OGs.

1777
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:10,300
Hedy, he's running a fever. I think that wound is infected.

1778
01:59:23,710 --> 01:59:24,900
Look after him.

1779
01:59:47,660 --> 01:59:49,730
Get off me! Get off!

1780
01:59:53,360 --> 01:59:55,020
Get off!

1783
02:00:14,670 --> 02:00:17,510
What's the issue between you and your father?

1784
02:00:21,680 --> 02:00:22,630
Jacklyn.

1785
02:00:24,590 --> 02:00:25,470
Who is she?

1786
02:00:30,930 --> 02:00:31,970
My mother.

1787
02:00:35,510 --> 02:00:36,430
My mom...

1788
02:00:39,720 --> 02:00:43,470
She had a very difficult delivery.

1789
02:00:52,430 --> 02:00:54,180
And she didn't survive?

1790
02:01:10,260 --> 02:01:11,550
My apology.

1791
02:01:14,380 --> 02:01:18,390
I'm intruding. It's none of my business.

1792
02:01:19,800 --> 02:01:21,010
My father...

1793
02:01:24,090 --> 02:01:25,760
he loved her more than me.

1794
02:01:28,260 --> 02:01:29,840
Never let me forget that either.

1795
02:01:34,800 --> 02:01:37,550
He has hated me since the day I was born.

1796
02:01:39,180 --> 02:01:40,430
All my fault.

1797
02:01:47,760 --> 02:01:49,970
I should've died instead of my mother.

1798
02:02:07,010 --> 02:02:09,180
Goddamn snakebite. Come on.

1799
02:02:11,880 --> 02:02:13,640
Mother... Fuck you!

1800
02:02:16,260 --> 02:02:17,040
Fuck!

1801
02:02:33,180 --> 02:02:34,840
God, you're a trickster.

1802
02:02:35,260 --> 02:02:38,180
Oh, God. You're a trickster.

1803
02:02:41,340 --> 02:02:42,470
Come to Papa.

1804
02:03:36,420 --> 02:03:37,390
Oh, f--

1805
02:03:43,720 --> 02:03:47,090
You got it, Norm. All for you, baby.

1806
02:03:53,340 --> 02:03:55,510
Life is a bitch!

1807
02:04:00,220 --> 02:04:03,680
If I gotta go out, I gotta go out like a man, Blood.

1808
02:04:04,760 --> 02:04:06,300
Morals and ethics.

1809
02:04:07,300 --> 02:04:09,140
Sounds like Stormin' Norman.

1810
02:04:11,930 --> 02:04:14,010
You know, I keep hearing his voice in my head,

1811
02:04:14,010 --> 02:04:16,390
telling me to do right, just to get it right.

1812
02:04:19,380 --> 02:04:22,090
Stormin' had this whole living thing figured out.

1813
02:04:23,630 --> 02:04:26,260
We are not gonna die in Nam.

1814
02:04:30,840 --> 02:04:32,350
Come on, let's battle, Blood.

1815
02:04:47,970 --> 02:04:48,630
Bloods.

1816
02:04:48,640 --> 02:04:49,970
I was asleep.

1817
02:04:49,970 --> 02:04:52,430
Man, I was fast asleep, knocked out, man.

1818
02:04:52,800 --> 02:04:54,340
God poked and woke me.

1819
02:04:55,760 --> 02:04:59,670
I said, "God... God, why you waking my black ass up?"

1820
02:04:59,670 --> 02:05:00,930
God said to me,

1821
02:05:01,300 --> 02:05:04,670
"Paul, fuck them motherfuckers.

1822
02:05:04,670 --> 02:05:06,340
Keep on keeping on."

1823
02:05:08,090 --> 02:05:11,720
I said to God, "God, do what now?"

1824
02:05:12,380 --> 02:05:14,430
God raised His voice, didn't yell,

1825
02:05:14,510 --> 02:05:18,430
but put some bass in that heavenly voice, said to me,

1826
02:05:19,930 --> 02:05:23,510
"Fuck them motherfuckers, Paul. They don't know shit.

1827
02:05:23,510 --> 02:05:26,340
Do your thing. Show you're right."

1828
02:05:47,260 --> 02:05:48,380
What you doing here, bruh?

1829
02:05:50,590 --> 02:05:52,300
I've been wanting to talk to you.

1830
02:05:53,800 --> 02:05:54,640
About what?

1831
02:05:56,130 --> 02:05:57,010
You know.

1832
02:06:00,800 --> 02:06:01,930
Go away, man.

1833
02:06:03,470 --> 02:06:04,390
Please?

1834
02:06:05,970 --> 02:06:07,550
No, no, come on now.

1835
02:06:07,550 --> 02:06:09,340
Come on now. Come on now.

1836
02:06:10,590 --> 02:06:12,260
That I can't do, Paul.

1837
02:06:17,970 --> 02:06:19,460
Gonna have to come clean.

1838
02:07:12,170 --> 02:07:13,590
Norm! Norm!

1839
02:07:51,220 --> 02:07:52,380
There it is.

1840
02:08:15,590 --> 02:08:17,180
It was an accident.

1841
02:08:20,880 --> 02:08:22,680
Ain't no thing, Blood.

1842
02:08:24,880 --> 02:08:26,010
Accident.

1843
02:08:29,630 --> 02:08:30,800
I forgive you.

1844
02:08:33,220 --> 02:08:34,180
You hear that?

1845
02:08:36,720 --> 02:08:37,970
I forgive you.

1846
02:08:39,970 --> 02:08:41,180
Ain't no thing, Blood.

1847
02:08:44,050 --> 02:08:45,180
Come on now.

1848
02:08:46,760 --> 02:08:49,260
Come on, Paul. Come on, Blood.

1849
02:08:52,720 --> 02:08:54,010
I forgive you.

1850
02:08:57,800 --> 02:08:59,180
God is love.

1851
02:09:00,930 --> 02:09:02,130
Love is God.

1852
02:09:07,840 --> 02:09:10,930
Come on. You got me now.

1853
02:09:13,590 --> 02:09:17,090
You got me good. Ain't no thing.

1854
02:09:26,220 --> 02:09:28,550
I'm sorr...

1855
02:09:28,920 --> 02:09:30,260
I'm sorr...

1856
02:09:32,090 --> 02:09:35,640
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1857
02:09:37,050 --> 02:09:38,340
I know you, Blood.

1858
02:09:40,470 --> 02:09:42,220
I died for you, Blood.

1859
02:09:46,050 --> 02:09:49,680
Keep digging. You're outnumbered.

1860
02:09:51,260 --> 02:09:53,600
We're always outnumbered.

1861
02:09:54,220 --> 02:09:55,550
Where's gold?

1862
02:09:55,840 --> 02:09:57,680
Stormin' Norman took it, man.

1863
02:09:59,470 --> 02:10:00,800
It was his.

1864
02:10:00,970 --> 02:10:02,380
Who's Stormin' Norman?

1865
02:10:03,470 --> 02:10:06,140
One bad black motherfucker.

1866
02:10:07,140 --> 02:10:08,390
Where's all the GI?

1867
02:10:09,640 --> 02:10:12,300
No, I will never tell.

1868
02:10:12,590 --> 02:10:16,010
See, we're Bloods.

1869
02:10:16,510 --> 02:10:17,640
We got a bond.

1870
02:10:18,880 --> 02:10:23,510
We fought... in a immoral war that wasn't ours,

1871
02:10:23,680 --> 02:10:27,760
for rights... for rights we didn't have.

1872
02:10:29,300 --> 02:10:30,470
They're my brothers.

1873
02:10:30,470 --> 02:10:32,510
You killed my brother.

1874
02:10:34,840 --> 02:10:36,180
I did.

1883

Okay, it's deep enough, man.

1884

02:12:07,090 --> 02:12:08,970
- Keep your eyes open. - On it.

1894
02:12:08,970 --> 02:12:10,090
Kool and the Gang.

1896
02:12:13,470 --> 02:12:14,800
After you've been in a war,

1897
02:12:14,800 --> 02:12:17,130
you understand it really never ends.

1898
02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:22,260
Whether it's in your mind or in reality.

1899
02:12:23,010 --> 02:12:24,300
There are just degrees.

1900
02:12:24,300 --> 02:12:25,930
Tell me about it.

1901
02:12:30,130 --> 02:12:34,640
If I happen to die, send my share here.

1902
02:12:42,380 --> 02:12:44,260
One of you two should have this.

1903
02:12:44,300 --> 02:12:45,630
No. I don't want it.

1904
02:12:45,630 --> 02:12:47,340
I ain't fired a gun in my life.

1905
02:12:47,340 --> 02:12:50,300
I shoot, I'd probably miss by a mile, especially with my leg.

1906
02:12:54,180 --> 02:12:56,720
My father? You seen him?

1907
02:12:57,090 --> 02:12:58,840
My hunch is Desroche is with him.

1908
02:12:58,920 --> 02:13:01,340
- Who? - One of your countrymen.

1909
02:13:01,630 --> 02:13:04,630
He set up our deal, probably gave us the old flimflam.

1910
02:13:04,630 --> 02:13:06,550
Perhaps I could appeal to him.

1911
02:13:06,720 --> 02:13:07,800
Worth a try.

1912
02:13:09,010 --> 02:13:10,380
Are you ready for this?

1913
02:13:10,880 --> 02:13:13,090
Blood, this ain't my first time in Nam.

1914
02:13:31,550 --> 02:13:34,010
Well, if we live, you'll teach me that.

1915
02:13:34,010 --> 02:13:35,510
We're all gonna live.

1916
02:13:35,970 --> 02:13:38,340
And maybe someday if I come to Paris,

1917
02:13:38,340 --> 02:13:42,090
you can show me the "Champs-Eleesees."

1918
02:13:42,430 --> 02:13:43,430
The what?

1919
02:13:43,760 --> 02:13:46,510
You know, the "Champs-Eleesees"? That big thing y'all got.

1920
02:13:47,880 --> 02:13:49,350
The Champs-élysées.

1921
02:13:50,380 --> 02:13:52,010
- Bet? - Bet.

1922
02:13:54,130 --> 02:13:55,510
Remember the plan.

1923
02:13:56,430 --> 02:13:57,390
Yes, sir.

1925
02:14:38,260 --> 02:14:40,300
Who is your pretty companion?

1933
02:15:03,630 --> 02:15:04,840
What'd he just say?

1934
02:15:05,800 --> 02:15:08,590
That the green is more important than black.

1936
02:15:10,300 --> 02:15:12,180
He asks for Norman's share.

1937
02:15:14,380 --> 02:15:15,390
I don't know.

1938
02:15:17,550 --> 02:15:20,550
Norman is pretty particular about what he shares.

1939
02:15:23,180 --> 02:15:25,470
- May I ask you a question? - Yes.

1940
02:15:27,760 --> 02:15:30,630
Was Tiên in on all this?

1941
02:15:31,170 --> 02:15:32,550
Tiên is a very smart woman,

1942
02:15:32,550 --> 02:15:36,170
but she doesn't have the appetite for a venture like this.

1943
02:15:36,180 --> 02:15:38,800
She knows nothing about this.

1944
02:15:39,340 --> 02:15:42,510
She is as innocent as you are ignorant.

1945
02:15:45,630 --> 02:15:47,390
Well, take the gold and...

1946
02:15:50,090 --> 02:15:51,430
leave in peace.

1947
02:15:52,720 --> 02:15:53,930
Go with God.

1948
02:15:54,430 --> 02:15:56,550
We just want what we came for.

1949
02:15:56,550 --> 02:15:57,340
Good.

1950
02:16:26,670 --> 02:16:28,640
You bastards!

1951
02:16:52,510 --> 02:16:54,180
Go, go, go!

1952
02:17:36,680 --> 02:17:38,800
- I can't feel a thing. - Fuck.

1953
02:17:40,050 --> 02:17:42,260
Straight through. Through and through.

1954
02:17:42,300 --> 02:17:44,720
- You'll survive, buddy. - Be safe.

1955
02:18:12,340 --> 02:18:13,640
Grenade!

1956
02:18:16,470 --> 02:18:17,340
No!

1957
02:18:29,170 --> 02:18:31,260
Your Bloods are all dead.

1958
02:18:32,470 --> 02:18:34,260
There is no one left.

1960
02:18:42,840 --> 02:18:44,340
Where is the gold?

1961
02:18:46,680 --> 02:18:49,010
Five Bloods don't die,

1962
02:18:50,140 --> 02:18:52,050
we multiply.

1963
02:18:54,720 --> 02:18:55,970
Allow me.

1964
02:19:09,800 --> 02:19:13,760
Madness! Madness!

1965
02:19:24,670 --> 02:19:26,970
Godfather, you'll be all right.

1966
02:19:43,720 --> 02:19:44,760
Dear David.

1967
02:19:46,550 --> 02:19:47,470
Son...

1968
02:19:50,470 --> 02:19:51,720
if you're reading this,

1969
02:19:52,470 --> 02:19:54,050
you know I've met my maker.

1971
02:20:04,840 --> 02:20:06,340
I gave this letter to...

1972
02:20:07,260 --> 02:20:08,550
my main man,

1973
02:20:10,180 --> 02:20:13,680
your godfather, Otis,

1975
02:20:13,880 --> 02:20:15,840
when we landed back in Nam.

1977
02:20:17,760 --> 02:20:20,630
I came back to confront the demons

1978
02:20:20,630 --> 02:20:24,180
that haunted me and tortured you.

1979
02:20:25,720 --> 02:20:28,300
I made you feel like you weren't loved.

1980
02:20:32,180 --> 02:20:36,180
Our brother Stormin' Norman always commanded us Bloods,

1981
02:20:36,300 --> 02:20:38,260
love one another.

1982
02:20:40,430 --> 02:20:42,550
In that way, I failed you, man.

1983
02:20:44,300 --> 02:20:46,180
All I can say to you is...

1984
02:20:49,590 --> 02:20:52,260
I'm sorry I put you through holy hell.

1985
02:20:57,180 --> 02:20:58,260
Believe me...

1986
02:20:58,840 --> 02:20:59,800
This just came.

1987
02:21:02,050 --> 02:21:03,430
it wasn't your fault.

1988
02:21:06,260 --> 02:21:07,340
There are things about me

1989
02:21:07,340 --> 02:21:11,300
that you will never know or understand, David.

1991
02:21:20,050 --> 02:21:22,430
I wish I could turn back the hands of time...

1993
02:21:33,550 --> 02:21:34,430
I can't.

1994
02:21:40,630 --> 02:21:41,800
Nobody can.

1995
02:21:46,550 --> 02:21:48,760
- Mic check! - Mic check!

1996
02:21:48,760 --> 02:21:50,470
- Mic check! - Mic check!

1997
02:21:50,470 --> 02:21:52,260
I got something I gotta share with y'all.

1998
02:21:52,260 --> 02:21:55,010
We just received a check from our soldier Eddie

2000
02:21:55,010 --> 02:21:57,380
for two million dollars!

2001
02:22:00,170 --> 02:22:02,220
- Mic check! - Mic check!

2002
02:22:02,220 --> 02:22:04,430
- Mic check! - Mic check!

2003
02:22:04,630 --> 02:22:07,130
When I say "black lives," y'all say "matter!"

2004
02:22:07,130 --> 02:22:08,510
- Black lives! - Matter!

2005
02:22:08,510 --> 02:22:09,840
- Black lives! - Matter!

2006
02:22:09,840 --> 02:22:13,550
- Black lives matter! - Black lives matter!

2007
02:22:13,550 --> 02:22:17,840
Black lives matter! Black lives matter!

2008
02:22:17,920 --> 02:22:21,300
Black lives matter! Black lives matter!

2009
02:22:21,180 --> 02:22:26,090
{\an8}LAMB

2010
02:22:21,300 --> 02:22:22,010
Thank you.

2011
02:22:22,010 --> 02:22:26,090
Thank you, everyone being here on this sad but beautiful day.

2012
02:22:26,220 --> 02:22:29,010
And I'm happy to tell you that this three million dollar gift

2013
02:22:29,010 --> 02:22:32,260
is donated in the name of my late colleague,

2014
02:22:32,380 --> 02:22:33,840
Seppo Havelin,

2015
02:22:33,840 --> 02:22:37,090
and will work toward removing mines and bombs,

2016
02:22:37,550 --> 02:22:42,590
and also restoring the lives of victims all over the world.

2017
02:23:07,430 --> 02:23:08,180

2018
02:23:09,340 --> 02:23:10,260
Left.

2019
02:23:11,380 --> 02:23:12,390
Left.

2020
02:23:13,510 --> 02:23:14,430
Left.

2021
02:23:15,630 --> 02:23:16,590
Left.

2022
02:23:22,550 --> 02:23:24,880
But to eternity and back,

2023
02:23:26,140 --> 02:23:29,930
your dear mother, Jackie, and I...

2024
02:23:32,260 --> 02:23:35,260
will love you always.

2025
02:23:41,840 --> 02:23:48,140
You best believe I will love you always, son.

2026
02:23:49,920 --> 02:23:51,010
Your father.

2027
02:23:53,590 --> 02:23:54,840
Your dad.

2028
02:24:01,920 --> 02:24:02,930
Otis.

2029
02:24:03,800 --> 02:24:07,720
I couldn't go back home without seeing you both before I left.

2031
02:24:31,930 --> 02:24:35,220
I miss you. And I love you so...

2032
02:24:35,840 --> 02:24:37,590
And I love you.

2034
02:25:13,090 --> 02:25:15,840
To save the soul of America.

2035
02:25:16,800 --> 02:25:20,090
We were convinced that we could not limit our vision

2036
02:25:20,090 --> 02:25:22,590
to certain rights for black people...

2037
02:25:23,010 --> 02:25:25,090
but instead affirmed the conviction

2038
02:25:25,090 --> 02:25:30,640
that America would never be free or saved from itself

2039
02:25:30,880 --> 02:25:33,260
until the descendants of its slaves

2040
02:25:33,260 --> 02:25:38,300
were loosed completely from the shackles they still wear.

2041
02:25:38,970 --> 02:25:42,640
In a way, we were agreeing with Langston Hughes,

2042
02:25:42,840 --> 02:25:45,010
that black bard of Harlem,

2043
02:25:45,630 --> 02:25:47,010
who had written earlier,

2044
02:25:47,010 --> 02:25:51,180
"Oh, yes I say it plain

2045
02:25:51,470 --> 02:25:54,840
America never was America to me

2046
02:25:55,220 --> 02:26:00,200
And yet I swear this oath America will be!"

2049
02:27:46,050 --> 02:27:47,140
Be safe.

2050
02:34:30,300 --> 02:34:37,550
Shit!

2051
02:34:37,590 --> 02:34:38,380
Cut!
