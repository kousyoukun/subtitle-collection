00:08:15,665 --> 00:08:17,100
- Fake news.
- Always go to that one.

155
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:19,165
- Yeah.
- I'm tired of not getting mine, man.

156
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,082
I feel you. I feel you.

157
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:25,957
Been fucked my whole goddamn life, bruh.
Goin' for me!

158
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,415
Shit. For real.

159
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,000
- Huh.
- I mean, back in the day,

160
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,707
- being a brother meant something.
- Yeah, man.

161
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,125
We fought against the man.

162
00:08:34,207 --> 00:08:35,875
- We loved one another.
- Amen.

163
00:08:35,957 --> 00:08:39,165
We became ace boon coon blood brothers
out there in that damn jungle.

164
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,082
- Preach on it.
- Yeah.

165
00:08:40,165 --> 00:08:42,207
- Stormin' Norm demanded it.
- He did.

166
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:43,558
- Sure did.
- All right, come on.

167
00:08:43,582 --> 00:08:45,332
- Yeah.
- Here we go. Boom!

168
00:08:45,415 --> 00:08:46,832
- [all] Boom!
- All right, yeah.

169
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,040
- Otis.
- Vinh.

170
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:59,040
- This is our guide, Vinh.
- Hey, I'm Eddie.

171
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:02,250
- Vinh.
- I'm Melvin, man.

172
00:09:02,332 --> 00:09:03,725
- Nice to meet you.
- How you doing?

173
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,082
- [Vinh] Good.
- Paul, man.

174
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:06,206
- Good to meet you.
- Yeah.

175
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,375
Gentlemen, welcome back to Vietnam.

176
00:09:09,957 --> 00:09:11,477
- Thank you.
- [Melvin] Thank you, man.

177
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:17,707
I have itinerary for you.
That's for you.

178
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,541
- For you.
- [Otis] Thank you.

179
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,457
- For you. Thank you.
- Pull up a seat.

180
00:09:23,582 --> 00:09:28,457
I still think hiking into the jungle
without me as your guide is a big mistake.

181
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:31,375
- We know that jungle, man.
- Yes, we sure do.

182
00:09:31,457 --> 00:09:32,790
- Oh, yeah.
- [low chuckles]

183
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,625
[Vinh] Do you have
the necessary documents?

184
00:09:35,707 --> 00:09:37,040
[Otis] Yes, there you go.

185
00:09:39,165 --> 00:09:43,250
From the Pentagon...
and from the Vietnamese government.

186
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,582
When we locate Norman's remains,

187
00:09:46,665 --> 00:09:49,957
the DPAA is gonna send in a recovery team
to bring him back home.

188
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,875
Arlington National Cemetery.

189
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:57,582
Hey, man, what the... what the fuck
are they staring at, man?

190
00:09:57,665 --> 00:09:58,582
Who?

191
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:00,457
Those two right there.

192
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:05,750
Shit. Those two over there, they've been
staring at us for the last ten minutes.

193
00:10:05,832 --> 00:10:06,875
[speaking Vietnamese]

194
00:10:06,957 --> 00:10:10,666
- [Eddie] Just chill, man. Just chill.
- Chill? People staring at me, man.

195
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,832
Staring at all of us.

196
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:14,666
Those gentlemen just buy you this drink.

197
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:18,666
They are former Viet Cong and wanna
welcome you all back to their country.

198
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,750
Yeah?

199
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:23,582
- [Vinh] One of them is my cousin, Nguyen.
- [Otis] Get outta here.

200
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,541
And my father's younger brother.

201
00:10:26,832 --> 00:10:29,791
- [Eddie] But you're from the south.
- They fought for the north.

202
00:10:30,457 --> 00:10:32,832
Nguyen does tours
for North Vietnamese tourists.

203
00:10:35,207 --> 00:10:39,165
The American War turned Vietnamese family
against Vietnamese family.

204
00:10:42,915 --> 00:10:44,915
- Paul.
- Hey, man.

205
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,665
Those could've been the dudes
that zapped Norm, that's all I'm saying.

206
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:54,500
Will you raise your goddamn glass?
The American War is over. Come on.

207
00:10:56,415 --> 00:10:57,415
Come on, man.

208
00:11:02,707 --> 00:11:03,875
[in Vietnamese]

209
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,082
[Otis] Whoo!

210
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,791
- [in English] Good night.
- Oh, yeah. Oh.

211
00:11:14,582 --> 00:11:17,082
- Feelin' the love.
- Oh, man. Look at him.

212
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,416
- I tell ya.
- I know.

213
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,500
[all chuckling]

214
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:23,832
[laughing and mocking in Vietnamese]

215
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,000
GI! GI! [laughing]

216
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:28,916
[dramatic instrumental music plays]

217
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:56,665
Now I know why this mission
was so damn important.

218
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,832
It's about what this war is all about.

219
00:12:01,082 --> 00:12:02,250
There it is.

220
00:12:36,165 --> 00:12:40,625
[Norman] All right, Bloods.
Our objective is in the C-47.

221
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:07,666
[soldiers speaking Vietnamese]

222
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:20,791
[groans]

223
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,207
[soldiers yelling in Vietnamese]

224
00:13:35,582 --> 00:13:38,415
- [Norman] Hold yourself! Hold on!
- [all shouting]

225
00:13:43,707 --> 00:13:45,582
[all screaming]

226
00:13:46,957 --> 00:13:48,125
- Come on.
- [Melvin] Hold on!

227
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:57,790
[all shouting]

228
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,933
- [Eddie] Lock it up!
- [Norman] Cover the Bloods to the plane!

229
00:13:59,957 --> 00:14:02,291
- [Paul] Go! Go, man! You got it!
- Harlow and Cots, KIA!

230
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,291
- [soldiers scream]
- [firing continues]

231
00:14:17,207 --> 00:14:18,207
[soldier screams]

232
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,582
[Norman] Lay down cover fire!

233
00:14:22,582 --> 00:14:23,791
[Otis] Go!

234
00:14:32,707 --> 00:14:33,707
Reloading.

235
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,957
- Reload!
- Reloading.

236
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:50,750
[soldiers scream]

237
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:01,000
Move out! Move out!

238
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,000
[speaking Vietnamese]

239
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:16,707
Fuck! Jammed!

240
00:15:20,207 --> 00:15:22,457
[Otis] Come on! Go!

241
00:15:23,082 --> 00:15:24,332
Move, move, move!

242
00:15:26,082 --> 00:15:27,082
[speaking Vietnamese]

243
00:15:34,207 --> 00:15:35,457
[Norman] Go, go, go!

244
00:15:38,332 --> 00:15:39,332
Go!

245
00:15:42,332 --> 00:15:44,165
Man down! Man down!

246
00:15:52,165 --> 00:15:53,165
[groans]

247
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:55,165
[soldiers yelling in Vietnamese]

248
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,457
[Norman] Check fire. Paul! Get up! Get up!

249
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,125
[soldiers yelling in Vietnamese]

250
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:15,291
Team one, take security!

251
00:16:16,332 --> 00:16:17,625
[Paul] Set security!

252
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:20,582
Set security!

253
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:32,540
Hey, Paul, come inside!

254
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:39,915
Clear!

255
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,040
Bloods!

256
00:16:48,332 --> 00:16:49,582
[Paul] Yo, come on in here.

257
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,290
All right. Let's see what we got here.

258
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,375
- [Melvin] Out of sight!
- [Paul] Great googly-moogly.

259
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:15,708
You know what this means?

260
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,000
We gold standard.

261
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:19,375
[laughs]

262
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:20,958
We gold standard.

263
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:26,790
I've run many tours for Gls
from the American War.

264
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:31,500
Glad you can now see our country
in a different light.

265
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:37,500
Wow! Will you look at this?

266
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:40,125
- [Melvin] It's a whole different place.
- I can't believe it.

267
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:43,125
They didn't need us.
They should've just sent Mickey D's,

268
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:44,665
Pizza Hut and The Colonel,

269
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,958
and we would have defeated the V.C.
in one week.

270
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,881
- You got it. [chuckles]
- Finger-lickin' good.

271
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,333
Paul, when did you serve?

272
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:58,458
I did three tours, man.
'67 to '71. 1st Infantry.

273
00:17:59,165 --> 00:18:01,915
Were you involved
in Operation Junction City?

274
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,165
- We were there. We were all there.
- Oh, yeah.

275
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,250
Yeah.

276
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,165
My father was there, too.

277
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:10,833
- Yeah?
- 25th Infantry, ARVN.

278
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,750
He fought to the very last man.

279
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,915
My brother, give it to me. Give it to me.

280
00:18:18,915 --> 00:18:21,625
My family was here in Saigon when it fell.

281
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:25,665
My dad spent 18 months
in a communist re-education camp.

282
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:26,750
Wow.

283
00:18:27,165 --> 00:18:28,833
Many other were not so lucky.

284
00:18:30,665 --> 00:18:33,708
Hey, y'all remember
those fugazi <i>Rambo</i> movies?

285
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:34,915
- Sly.
- Yeah.

286
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,583
I like them shits, man.

287
00:18:36,665 --> 00:18:38,540
You gotta be fucking kidding me, man.

288
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:42,458
Him and that... that dude, uh,
Walker, Texas Ranger.

289
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,250
- I ain't saying nothing about him.
- Man!

290
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:47,915
Out there trying to save
some imaginary POWs.

291
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,875
All them Holly-weird motherfuckers
trying to go back and win the Vietnam War.

292
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:56,708
Yeah. I would be the first cat in line
if there was a flick about a real hero,

293
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:59,875
you know, one of our blood.
Somebody like Milton Olive.

294
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:03,290
[Eddie] <i>That man jumped on that grenade</i>
<i>and saved his Bloods' lives.</i>

295
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:07,250
[Otis] <i>And he was the first brother</i>
<i>to be awarded the Medal of Honor in Nam.</i>

Eighteen years old.

297
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:13,165
Look, I love y'all and all that bullshit,
but, uh, I ain't doin' that.

298
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,500
Man, nobody want you to die for them.

299
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,790
'Cause I ain't.

- Oh, Vinh.
- What the fuck he talkin' about?

302
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:25,500
Listen, Bloods, I'm out, all right?
Thank you very much.

303
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:26,708
- Thank you.
- All right.

304
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,458
- Oh. Oh, oh. Be careful, man.
- Yeah?

305
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:32,415
I'll be careful. Later.

306
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:34,083
Where's he going?

307
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:37,040
[Paul] <i>He got something</i>

00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,625
you have hardly changed.

311
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:07,290
We both know that's not true.
But thank you for being so kind.

312
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,833
You look like
you've done well for yourself.

313
00:20:14,415 --> 00:20:15,833
We find a way.

314
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:21,540
- Yes, we do. When we can.
- Yes.

315
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,165
[in Vietnamese]

316
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:27,500
[Otis chuckles]

317
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:31,115
[in English] The gold is belong
to Vietnamese government.

318
00:20:31,915 --> 00:20:35,165
Monsieur Desroche converts the gold
into cash.

319
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:40,375
He's the only person that I know
who can handle a transaction of this size.

320
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:45,083
- Have you dealt with him before?
- Yes.

321
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:48,958
He's expensive. 20%.

322
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,208
- [sighs]
- And I will need 10%.

323
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:54,625
And there's no other way to move this?

324
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:56,290
[door opens]

325
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:59,165
- International export is my business.
- [door closes]

326
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,790
- It's why you call me.
- Yeah.

327
00:21:02,665 --> 00:21:04,375
[woman in Vietnamese]

328
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,250
[in English] This is my daughter, Michon.

329
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:23,375
And this is my old friend Otis.
From American War.

330
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,375
- [Otis whispers] It's, uh...
- Hello, Otis.

331
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:30,375
It's very nice to meet you.

332
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,375
[in Vietnamese]

333
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,333
[in English] Thanks, my dear.

334
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,540
[sighs]

335
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:14,915
Is, uh...

336
00:22:20,165 --> 00:22:25,208
Is, uh... Is that our daughter? Our...

337
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,333
Yes, she is.

338
00:22:31,165 --> 00:22:34,540
She was a bastard child of the enemy.

339
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:38,208
I was a whore.

340
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:42,540
Her father was a <i>moi,</i> the nigger.

341
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:47,915
The white GI taught us that word.

342
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:50,458
Everyone want us out.

343
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:55,500
We was too dirty to even clean the toilet.

344
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:01,500
They call our beautiful Michon
the cockroach.

345
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:09,165
- Mmm?
- No.

346
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:20,750
Good night, Tiên.

347
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:22,415
Good night, Otis.

348
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:29,290
[Michon in Vietnamese]

349
00:24:12,915 --> 00:24:14,375
[bell tolling]

350
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:27,290
[in English] May I ask, how did they
end up in your possession?

351
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:29,750
You ask a lotta goddamn questions,
wringer.

352
00:24:32,165 --> 00:24:36,333
Monsieur, maybe they're from a bank
you just knocked off in Manila.

353
00:24:36,415 --> 00:24:39,125
Or maybe the authorities
are looking for them.

354
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:41,125
I don't need that kind of shit.

355
00:24:41,208 --> 00:24:43,583
We ain't no international criminals,
you dig?

356
00:24:43,665 --> 00:24:47,375
In my line of work,
I have to be very careful,

357
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:51,458
and that means knowing exactly
who I am in business with.

358
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,958
This cat getting on
my last goddamn nerve, man.

359
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:57,208
Gentlemen, I believe
our business is finished.

360
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:58,458
[Paul] Hey, wait a minute.

361
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:02,083
Do me a favor. Sit down, please?
Just give us that respect.

362
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,040
Where were Frenchies in World War II?

363
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:10,083
Hitler had y'all by the snails.

364
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:14,165
The goddamn US of A saved your asses.

365
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,958
If it wasn't for good ol' Uncle Sam,
all of yous,

366
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:20,750
y'all be speaking the <i>deutsche</i>
eating bratwurst,

367
00:25:20,833 --> 00:25:26,540
schnitzels and sauerkraut instead
of croissants, snails and escargot.

368
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:27,790
Come on, Blood. Let it go.

369
00:25:27,875 --> 00:25:29,458
- No, man, no.
- Just let it go!

370
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:32,165
No, fuck that. I ain't done.

371
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:37,500
This motherfucker can't tell me shit.

372
00:25:38,208 --> 00:25:40,750
My daddy, God rest his soul,

373
00:25:40,833 --> 00:25:45,040
landed in Normandy and killed <i>beaucoup</i>
goose-stepping Nazis.

374
00:25:45,125 --> 00:25:49,540
Let me tell you something, them Nazis
weren't no punks neither. Not like you.

375
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:56,875
- Yeah, okay, I'm done.
- You feel better?

376
00:25:56,958 --> 00:25:58,415
- Yeah.
- [Desroche] Well,

377
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,665
I thank you for this ignorant American
one-sided version of World War II.

378
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:08,583
Please understand. He taking big risk.

379
00:26:08,665 --> 00:26:09,915
And we ain't?

380
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:15,250
DaRoach, we gotta trust you,
and you gotta trust us.

381
00:26:17,165 --> 00:26:18,415
[Otis] Mr. Desroche...

382
00:26:20,665 --> 00:26:24,375
Our platoon was ordered
to find a C-47 CIA plane

383
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:28,165
that went down with a payroll
for the native people. The Lahu.

384
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,958
Now, they didn't wanna be paid
in paper currency,

385
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:35,250
so Uncle Sam was paying them in gold bars
for their help against the V.C.

386
00:26:35,958 --> 00:26:38,208
Well, we found the gold, and we...

387
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:43,125
We bury it. For now.
They ask, we say the V.C. got it.

388
00:26:43,958 --> 00:26:46,790
Later on, we come back and collect.

389
00:26:46,875 --> 00:26:48,208
You mean rip it off.

390
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:50,000
We ain't ripping off shit!

391
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:53,415
Who feel like
they're ripping something off?

392
00:26:54,415 --> 00:26:57,708
We was the very first people
that died for this red, white and blue.

393
00:26:58,665 --> 00:26:59,833
Yeah, that's right.

394
00:27:00,708 --> 00:27:04,875
It was a soul brother, Crispus Attucks
at the motherfuckin' Boston Massacre.

395
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:08,458
We been dying for this country
from the very get,

396
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:11,040
hoping one day they'd give us
our rightful place.

397
00:27:11,125 --> 00:27:14,415
All they give us was a foot
up our black asses. Well, fuck that.

398
00:27:15,125 --> 00:27:20,000
I say the USA owe us. We built this bitch!

399
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:22,208
So, what you sayin', Blood?

400
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:27,750
I'm saying... we repossess this gold...

401
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:32,665
like they about to come repossess
your cash yield convertible now.

402
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,165
[all laughing]

403
00:27:36,665 --> 00:27:41,540
We repossess this gold for every single
black boot that never made it home.

404
00:27:42,333 --> 00:27:46,415
Every brother and sister stolen
from Mother Africa to Jamestown, Virginia

405
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,790
way back in 1619.

406
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:54,165
We give this gold to our people.

407
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:58,375
You feel that? You feel it?

408
00:28:00,458 --> 00:28:03,125
- Now, let's bury our gold.
- [Paul] Reparations.

409
00:28:03,208 --> 00:28:05,208
- [glasses clink]
- [Norman] Bloods.

410
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:06,708
- [gunshot echoes]
- [all] <i>Bloods.</i>

411
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:08,665
[distant gunfire]

412
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,958
We went back a few weeks later,
but the area was napalmed,

413
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,333
and we lost all of our landmarks.

414
00:28:16,415 --> 00:28:22,625
But recently, a mudslide has exposed
what might be the C-47's tail,

415
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:26,375
and satellite pictures
have pinpointed the spot.

416
00:28:26,458 --> 00:28:29,958
Mmm. You're more informed
than your friend here.

417
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,790
Sir, are you in or out?

418
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:53,415
This is my last offer per kilo,
less my commission.

419
00:29:03,833 --> 00:29:04,875
Tiên said 20.

420
00:29:04,958 --> 00:29:09,208
One cannot carry millions of dollars
through US Customs.

421
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:13,125
The extra two points will get you
a dummy corporation

422
00:29:13,208 --> 00:29:16,708
and a tax-free offshore account in Macau.

423
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:21,083
You can then withdraw the funds
from any bank in the world.

424
00:29:21,165 --> 00:29:23,708
How do I know that you two
ain't a con artist team?

425
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:28,250
As you said, you simply must trust us.

426
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:32,458
Yeah, well, the extra 2%
comes outta her cut.

427
00:29:33,458 --> 00:29:34,458
That's right.

428
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:39,500
- I'll cover it.
- Price of doing business.

429
00:29:40,415 --> 00:29:42,665
- So, we good?
- Yeah.

430
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,958
- I'm good.
- Yeah, I'm good.

431
00:29:46,708 --> 00:29:52,125
And, sir, Uncle Sam did no better
than France in Vietnam.

432
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:57,625
Gentlemen, I look forward
to seeing you again in a few days.

433
00:29:57,708 --> 00:29:59,125
If you will excuse me,

434
00:29:59,208 --> 00:30:02,083
I have a lot of things to do
for all of us.

435
00:30:02,915 --> 00:30:04,000
[in French]

436
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:06,790
[in English] And, uh...

437
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:08,415
<i>vive la France.</i>

438
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,708
[in English] This motherfucker, man.

439
00:30:12,583 --> 00:30:13,823
- [door shuts]
- [water running]

440
00:30:14,458 --> 00:30:15,708
[softly] I don't take that.

441
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:17,875
[water stops running]

442
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:27,833
What the fuck are you doing here?

443
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,625
I'm worried about you.

444
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:32,250
Why?

445
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,540
- Well, I found out you were coming here.
- And?

446
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,250
And I came to check on you.

447
00:30:41,125 --> 00:30:44,540
You don't give a flying fuck
about me. [scoffs]

448
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:47,583
I do. You been acting more crazy
than usual.

449
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,540
Yeah, well...

450
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,458
you consider me checked on.

451
00:30:59,208 --> 00:31:00,583
You're here for the gold.

452
00:31:01,375 --> 00:31:02,375
Don't lie.

453
00:31:03,458 --> 00:31:05,875
You're going after the gold.
I read Otis' emails.

454
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:11,415
You gotta choose better passwords.
"1-2-3-4"?

455
00:31:12,375 --> 00:31:14,415
[laughs] Come on now, Dad.

456
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:16,415
What do you want, David?

457
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,583
- An equal share for helping you find it.
- Hell to the naw!

458
00:31:19,665 --> 00:31:23,165
The authorities find out about this,
y'all go back to the crib empty-handed.

459
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:27,458
So, you just a lil' jive-ass
gangster now, huh?

460
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:31,790
After everything you've put me through,
I'd say you getting a basement bargain.

461
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,040
You ungrateful lil'...
lil' Black Studies teacher nigga.

462
00:31:40,333 --> 00:31:42,875
You want to tell your Bloods or should I?

463
00:31:49,958 --> 00:31:51,917
[Eddie] You sure know

925
01:02:44,291 --> 01:02:46,666
- [animals continue howling]
- [leaves rustling]

926
01:02:48,708 --> 01:02:50,000
[David] Dad! Dad!

927
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:54,500
Gibbons.

928
01:02:56,125 --> 01:02:58,333
I seen a leopard tear one apart once.

929
01:02:59,166 --> 01:03:00,583
There are leopards out here?

930
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:05,000
Leopards are all gone now.
Poachers wiped 'em out.

931
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:07,625
- You see that?
- What? What? What?

932
01:03:07,708 --> 01:03:10,750
Shh! Looked like a man walking out there.

933
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,708
It was just a flash, but I saw it.

934
01:03:14,875 --> 01:03:15,875
[shushing]

935
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:19,208
- Maybe... Maybe it was a monkey.
- No goddamn monkey.

936
01:03:26,166 --> 01:03:27,666
[David] Hey, you see something?

937
01:03:29,875 --> 01:03:33,166
[whispers] Clear. Clear.

938
01:03:38,291 --> 01:03:39,916
Oh, my God.

939
01:03:47,791 --> 01:03:52,083
I'm sorry about being on edge,
you know. Being back here...

940
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:57,083
it is not easy.

941
01:03:59,791 --> 01:04:00,833
It's cool.

942
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:06,125
I don't like the way you did it,
but I'm glad you're here.

943
01:04:10,833 --> 01:04:12,416
Your daddy loves you, you know.

944
01:04:14,333 --> 01:04:15,500
You know that, right?

945
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:20,416
- You've got a funny way of showing it.
- Yeah.

946
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,541
But I do. I know it.

947
01:04:25,166 --> 01:04:26,375
I love you back.

948
01:04:27,958 --> 01:04:31,083
- [mosquito buzzing]
- [grunts]

949
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:33,250
[buzzing continues]

950
01:04:33,333 --> 01:04:38,125
Damn! Who got the bug spray?
Bugs out here eating my ass up.

951
01:04:40,083 --> 01:04:41,416
Otis had it last.

952
01:04:42,250 --> 01:04:45,416
[Melvin] Well, can you walk your big
pigeon-toed ass over there and get it?

953
01:04:46,333 --> 01:04:48,000
What's wrong with your big lumbering ass?

954
01:04:48,083 --> 01:04:49,833
Man, you sitting right there.

955
01:04:49,916 --> 01:04:51,891
- [Paul] Oh, shit.
- You sitting right next to the bug spray.

956
01:04:51,916 --> 01:04:54,166
I gotta get up from my rock,
walk over there and get it.

957
01:04:54,250 --> 01:04:55,791
You're one lazy-ass motherfucker.

958
01:04:55,875 --> 01:05:00,083
[Melvin] You a Thanksgiving jive
turkey giblet sorry-ass motherfucker.

959
01:05:00,166 --> 01:05:02,641
- [David] Shut up. He's trying to sleep.
- [Melvin] We up, he should be up.

960
01:05:02,666 --> 01:05:05,000
[Eddie] Every time,
you want me to get the shit.

961
01:05:05,083 --> 01:05:07,416
You can't get up and do it your damn self.

962
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:10,380
[Melvin] I got to get up off my damn rock
and walk over there and get it.

963
01:05:10,416 --> 01:05:16,791
You sitting right there. You get it?
You see it? Big paddle ass. God damn.

964
01:05:16,875 --> 01:05:17,875
Hey, Paul.

965
01:05:34,708 --> 01:05:36,250
Ain't this a bitch?

966
01:05:41,625 --> 01:05:42,833
Nigga, get up.

967
01:05:42,916 --> 01:05:44,396
- [Otis] What?
- [Paul] Get up, nigga.

968
01:05:45,916 --> 01:05:47,250
Why you ain't tell us, man?

969
01:05:47,333 --> 01:05:48,708
- [Otis] What?
- What?

970
01:05:49,666 --> 01:05:52,041
No wonder he wanted to make
all the arrangements.

971
01:05:52,125 --> 01:05:54,416
- Tiên give this to you?
- So, what about it?

972
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:55,851
[Paul] We should all be packin', you...

973
01:05:55,875 --> 01:05:57,266
- [Melvin] No.
- [David] Get the gun!

974
01:05:57,291 --> 01:05:59,016
- [Eddie] Come on, man!
- [Paul] You motherfucker!

975
01:05:59,041 --> 01:06:01,333
- [Otis] Come on. Beat his ass down, now.
- [David] Shit.

976
01:06:02,833 --> 01:06:03,666
You all right?

977
01:06:03,750 --> 01:06:05,875
You a pussy-whipped motherfucker,
ain't you?

978
01:06:05,958 --> 01:06:07,666
Man, you don't see who she is?

979
01:06:08,666 --> 01:06:10,541
And that French fuck, Desroche.

980
01:06:10,625 --> 01:06:13,125
I don't know Desroche
from Adam's house cat,

981
01:06:14,125 --> 01:06:16,583
but if Tiên vouched for him,
that's good enough for me.

982
01:06:17,125 --> 01:06:20,541
She's a Soul Alley ho, remember that.

983
01:06:21,125 --> 01:06:23,625
You know, Paul, you better check yourself.

984
01:06:23,708 --> 01:06:27,250
I know your mama-san's slanted pussy
strung you out.

985
01:06:27,333 --> 01:06:29,041
She's still a fucking ho!

986
01:06:31,458 --> 01:06:32,458
[David] Whoa, whoa, man!

987
01:06:32,541 --> 01:06:35,833
Get your motherfucking hands off me!
I'll kill you!

988
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:38,476
- I'll kill that motherfucker.
- Chill! Chill! Chill!

989
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:40,416
Chill! What the fuck's wrong with you?

990
01:06:41,750 --> 01:06:42,666
Breathe, man!

991
01:06:42,750 --> 01:06:45,625
[Otis] Come on. Give it to him.

992
01:06:46,833 --> 01:06:48,166
Go ahead, give it to him.

993
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:53,166
Take it. I'm through with it.

994
01:06:55,291 --> 01:06:56,291
Here.

995
01:06:57,916 --> 01:06:58,916
Happy?

996
01:07:04,958 --> 01:07:06,916
[Otis] Man, we're walking
right on top of it.

997
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,250
[Melvin] You said that on the last hill.
Perspective's totally different.

998
01:07:10,333 --> 01:07:11,875
[Otis] No, it's gotta be here.

999
01:07:11,958 --> 01:07:14,916
[Eddie] God damn! We're fucking lost!

1000
01:07:15,708 --> 01:07:18,375
- [Paul] Otis and Eddie think they slick.
- [Otis] What?

1001
01:07:18,458 --> 01:07:21,708
[Paul] Marching us around and around
in circles so we give up and go home.

1002
01:07:22,208 --> 01:07:24,750
You come back,
you collect it all for yourself, huh?

1003
01:07:24,833 --> 01:07:27,875
Then why'd I follow your sorry ass
out here in the first place?

1004
01:07:27,958 --> 01:07:30,541
'Cause you couldn't afford
the airfare, the gear, hotel.

1005
01:07:31,416 --> 01:07:34,458
[chuckles] You needed
Banker Drysdale right there. Uh-huh.

1006
01:07:34,541 --> 01:07:35,541
Shut up!

1007
01:07:37,458 --> 01:07:39,125
You and Tiên are up to something.

1008
01:07:40,333 --> 01:07:42,666
Let me tell you something, Otis,
all y'all.

1009
01:07:44,666 --> 01:07:49,375
I don't need this shit. You got me?
I'm here for Norm.

1010
01:07:50,333 --> 01:07:54,583
I'm here for Norm.
I ain't going for no okey-doke bullshit.

1011
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:58,958
Dope fiend double-cross, hell no.
Fuck that.

1012
01:08:01,833 --> 01:08:03,416
Where you going, boy?

1013
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:05,708
I'mma go down to the bank
and make a deposit.

1014
01:08:06,208 --> 01:08:09,125
- Go on, son. Handle your business.
- [Otis] Let me see that GPS.

1015
01:08:13,333 --> 01:08:14,833
This don't make no damn sense.

1016
01:08:18,582 --> 01:08:20,041
Shit, man. Come on.

1017
01:08:47,791 --> 01:08:48,832
[metallic clinking]

1018
01:08:55,832 --> 01:08:59,332
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1019
01:09:00,291 --> 01:09:03,041
- Hey, Dad! Hey, guys!
- [Otis] What?

1020
01:09:03,125 --> 01:09:04,791
I think I found something!

1021
01:09:04,875 --> 01:09:06,416
- Gold! Gold!
- [overlapping] Oh, shit.

1022
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:07,699
[David] Quick, bring a shovel!

1023
01:09:07,750 --> 01:09:12,291
I think I found the gold!
Gold! Dad! Dad, I found it!

1024
01:09:12,375 --> 01:09:14,475
- [Otis] I hope he really found that shit.
- [David] Gold!

1025
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:15,707
[Paul] Where you at, son?

1026
01:09:15,791 --> 01:09:16,625
Watch your step.

1027
01:09:16,707 --> 01:09:18,166
[David] Shit, get your shovels!

1028
01:09:18,832 --> 01:09:24,500
Bring your shovels! Bring the shovels!
I found it! I found it! I found it!

1029
01:09:25,832 --> 01:09:27,207
[exclaims]

1030
01:09:27,957 --> 01:09:29,809
- [Paul] Watch your step over there.
- [Otis] Right.

1031
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:31,041
[David yells]

1032
01:09:35,166 --> 01:09:36,625
Holy shit!

1033
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,750
- [David] That's it, ain't it?
- That's it.

1034
01:09:42,582 --> 01:09:43,582
Holy...

1035
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,625
- God damn! Oh, man!
- [all laughing]

1036
01:09:49,707 --> 01:09:51,266
- [Eddie] Let me see.
- Yeah, that's it.

1037
01:09:51,291 --> 01:09:53,041
Oh, shit. [laughing]

1038
01:09:59,957 --> 01:10:00,957
Damn!

1039
01:10:01,916 --> 01:10:03,082
[David exclaims]

1040
01:10:04,541 --> 01:10:06,916
Check your map. Check your map.
Check your map.

1041
01:10:08,707 --> 01:10:10,291
We're in the right coordinates.

1042
01:10:13,291 --> 01:10:15,332
- Yeah. Yeah.
- [Eddie] Hey, y'all.

1043
01:10:16,041 --> 01:10:19,582
Hallowed ground, Bloods. Holy ground.

1044
01:10:19,666 --> 01:10:21,582
[laughing]

1045
01:10:21,666 --> 01:10:24,416
[David] Yeah, that's it, right?
That's it. [exclaims]

1046
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:25,541
Yeah, that's it.

1047
01:10:25,625 --> 01:10:26,850
- [Otis] Oh, Lord.
- Yeah, that's it.

1048
01:10:26,875 --> 01:10:28,750
- [Otis] Thank you, Lord.
- Yeah, that's it!

1049
01:10:28,832 --> 01:10:31,250
- [all laughing]
- [Otis] Yeah! Yeah, it is! Yeah, it is!

1050
01:10:31,332 --> 01:10:32,957
Yeah, it is, Bloods!

1051
01:10:33,041 --> 01:10:34,166
[all cheering]

1052
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,266
- Let me get a picture.
- [exclaiming]

1053
01:10:37,291 --> 01:10:39,250
No! No evidence, man. No evidence.

1054
01:10:39,332 --> 01:10:41,000
- [Melvin] Put that camera down.
- My bad.

1055
01:10:41,082 --> 01:10:42,166
[Paul] Hold that, man.

1056
01:10:44,916 --> 01:10:46,125
[all grunting rhythmically]

1057
01:10:46,207 --> 01:10:47,082
[David] Yeah.

1058
01:10:47,166 --> 01:10:49,332
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Yeah!

1059
01:10:49,416 --> 01:10:50,707
- Yeah!
- [metal detector beeps]

1060
01:10:50,791 --> 01:10:51,832
[David] Yeah!

1061
01:10:51,916 --> 01:10:53,041
Come on!

1062
01:10:54,916 --> 01:10:56,707
- Come on!
- [David] Whoo!

1063
01:11:00,082 --> 01:11:01,625
Oh, yeah. Come on, man.

1064
01:11:01,707 --> 01:11:03,541
- Come on, now!
- Come on, man, get it.

1065
01:11:03,625 --> 01:11:05,500
[metal detector beeping rapidly]

1066
01:11:05,582 --> 01:11:10,000
Guys! Guys! I got something!
I got something right here! Right here.

1067
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:12,000
I'm getting a hit right there.

1068
01:11:14,375 --> 01:11:15,391
- Right here?
- [Paul] Yeah.

1069
01:11:15,416 --> 01:11:16,416
[Eddie] Okay.

1070
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,059
- Yeah, that's something there.
- [Eddie] You in? Oh, shit!

1071
01:11:22,082 --> 01:11:23,332
[Paul] That's it right there.

1072
01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:26,109
[Eddie] This the spot, right here?

1073
01:11:26,582 --> 01:11:28,875
- Wait, I see something here.
- [Paul] Watch your fingers.

1074
01:11:28,957 --> 01:11:31,875
- Otis, it's right there.
- [Otis] Mind your hand. Look out.

1075
01:11:31,957 --> 01:11:32,957
Look out for your hands.

1076
01:11:36,207 --> 01:11:38,541
- Let's go. That's a lid!
- [David] I got a handle.

1077
01:11:40,082 --> 01:11:41,516
- Shit!
- [Eddie] What, it just come off?

1078
01:11:41,541 --> 01:11:43,750
- [David] Damn handle broke.
- [Otis] Shit. It rusted.

1079
01:11:43,832 --> 01:11:45,641
[Paul] Don't put the dirt back
where I dug it out!

1080
01:11:45,666 --> 01:11:47,791
- [Melvin] Move it out the damn way!
- It's all right.

1081
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,541
[Paul] Here, let's just grab it.
Grab it. It looks like...

1082
01:11:51,625 --> 01:11:53,707
[Eddie] Yeah. Ready? Bring it up!

1083
01:11:53,791 --> 01:11:54,791
[all grunting]

1084
01:12:01,082 --> 01:12:03,166
- Shit.
- Wait, where is it? Where is it?

1085
01:12:03,832 --> 01:12:05,666
- Come on!
- [Paul] You gotta be kidding me.

1086
01:12:05,750 --> 01:12:07,041
Let me tip it.

1087
01:12:08,166 --> 01:12:10,625
Ah! Fuckin' fool's gold.

1088
01:12:10,707 --> 01:12:12,166
[Otis laughing]

1089
01:12:12,250 --> 01:12:14,625
- [metal detector beeping]
- [Otis] Whoo!

1090
01:12:14,707 --> 01:12:16,582
We are some gold-plated fools, y'all.

1091
01:12:17,207 --> 01:12:19,875
We're some gold-plated
motherfucking fools.

1092
01:12:19,957 --> 01:12:22,791
Hey, guys, guys, I got another one!
I got something right here.

1093
01:12:22,875 --> 01:12:23,791
[Otis] Where?

1094
01:12:23,875 --> 01:12:25,082
- Right here.
- I got it!

1095
01:12:25,166 --> 01:12:27,600
- [Melvin] Right there!
- [Otis] I got it! I got it! I got it!

1096
01:12:27,625 --> 01:12:28,541
- [Eddie] Got that one?
- [Otis] Yeah.

1097
01:12:28,625 --> 01:12:29,625
[Eddie] All right, go.

1098
01:12:30,166 --> 01:12:31,457
[metal detector beeping rapidly]

1099
01:12:31,541 --> 01:12:32,934
- I got another one!
- [Eddie] I got it!

1100
01:12:32,957 --> 01:12:34,717
- I got another one right here.

1101
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:36,000

1102
01:12:36,082 --> 01:12:37,582
- You good?
- [Paul] I'm good.

1103
01:12:40,541 --> 01:12:42,041
[Otis exclaiming]

1104
01:12:42,166 --> 01:12:44,457
[screaming, laughter]

1105
01:12:47,750 --> 01:12:48,957
[all exclaiming]

1106
01:12:49,041 --> 01:12:50,059
- I got a hit!
- [Eddie] Oh, shit!

1107
01:12:50,082 --> 01:12:51,523
[Melvin]
I'm getting hits everywhere!

1108
01:12:51,582 --> 01:12:53,000
[metal detector continues beeping]

1109
01:12:53,082 --> 01:12:55,323
- Right there. Right there.
- [David] All right. Come on.

1110
01:12:58,582 --> 01:13:01,023
- I'm getting hits all over the damn place.
- [Otis] Oh, shit!

1111
01:13:01,082 --> 01:13:02,125
[Otis laughs]

1112
01:13:03,666 --> 01:13:06,625
[David] All right. Put it in your pocket.
Put it in your pocket.

1113
01:13:08,750 --> 01:13:11,791
- All right, I got three right here.
- [Paul] I got one here.

1114
01:13:13,625 --> 01:13:15,625
[David] Keep digging. Keep digging.

1115
01:13:19,166 --> 01:13:21,916
I'm getting hits all over the mountain!
All over the mountain!

1116
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,207
[all laughing]

1117
01:13:23,291 --> 01:13:25,041
[Paul and David exclaiming rhythmically]

1118
01:13:28,957 --> 01:13:30,125
[Paul] Come on, give me some.

1119
01:13:30,207 --> 01:13:31,375
[both exclaim]

1120
01:13:32,082 --> 01:13:34,375
Come on, baby. [yells]

1121
01:13:34,457 --> 01:13:36,957
Hey, I got one here. I got one here.

1122
01:13:37,041 --> 01:13:39,125
They must've fallen in the mudslide.

1123
01:13:39,207 --> 01:13:41,916
Hey, I got something to tell y'all.

1124
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,041
- What?
- What?

1125
01:13:43,875 --> 01:13:48,625
Holy motherfucking, motherfucking,
mother of gold!

1126
01:13:49,125 --> 01:13:52,000
- Mother of gold, motherfucker!
- [Melvin] Get your ass over here!

1127
01:13:52,082 --> 01:13:53,922
[Eddie] Why don't you start digging,
roody-poo?

1128
01:13:53,957 --> 01:13:57,582
Motherfucker, I don't dig for the gold!
I find the motherfucking gold!

1129
01:13:57,666 --> 01:13:58,875
- Fuck you!
- Silly-ass.

1130
01:13:58,957 --> 01:14:01,916
- [Paul] Watch your fingers.
- [David] Come on! Keep digging!

1131
01:14:04,125 --> 01:14:08,500
Forty-five thousand per bar.
Seventeen million all in.

1132
01:14:09,125 --> 01:14:10,666
[Eddie laughs] Yeah.

1133
01:14:11,416 --> 01:14:13,416
But I'm not leaving here without Norman.

1134
01:14:13,916 --> 01:14:16,750
[Melvin] You think Norman cares
whether you find his remains or not?

1135
01:14:17,332 --> 01:14:20,791
You remember what Norman said.
"That gold should go to our people."

1136
01:14:22,832 --> 01:14:24,875
Whoa, what you trying to say, man?

1137
01:14:25,541 --> 01:14:27,750
That gold should go
towards black liberation.

1138
01:14:27,832 --> 01:14:31,125
[scoffs] Yeah, our black liberation.
You do for self.

1139
01:14:31,750 --> 01:14:34,125
I'm talking about black reparations, man.

1140
01:14:34,207 --> 01:14:35,541
[Melvin] I got mine's.

1141
01:14:36,332 --> 01:14:37,541
What about our people?

1142
01:14:37,625 --> 01:14:39,082
What about my people?

1143
01:14:39,582 --> 01:14:42,957
You do what you want with your share,
and we'll each decide for ourselves.

1144
01:14:43,041 --> 01:14:46,250
- That's what Norman said now.
- Now, see? See? Otis knows.

1145
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:49,707
Norman wanted that gold
to go towards the cause.

1146
01:14:49,791 --> 01:14:53,916
Yeah, that's easy for you to say, Eddie.
You rich. Money don't mean shit to you.

1147
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,082
- I am not rich.
- Yeah, right. Whatever.

1148
01:14:57,166 --> 01:14:59,291
- I'm not rich!
- [chuckles] Okay.

1149
01:14:59,375 --> 01:15:02,832
- I'm broke, man.
- How the fuck are you broke, Eddie? Huh?

1150
01:15:06,666 --> 01:15:09,500
- I lost it all.
- Oh, he bullshittin'.

1151
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,166
I wish I was, man.

1152
01:15:13,166 --> 01:15:14,291
Spill it.

1153
01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:18,541
Come on, man. Fess up.

1154
01:15:22,416 --> 01:15:27,375
Ex-wives, bad investments, back taxes,

1155
01:15:27,457 --> 01:15:30,957
livin' large, drinking, being stupid.

1156
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:35,207
- You fuckin' name it, I spent money on it.
- But you paid for all of this shit.

1157
01:15:35,291 --> 01:15:39,332
Yeah, yeah, I paid for all this shit
on a black card that's already overdrawn.

1158
01:15:40,832 --> 01:15:43,750
What about all them car dealerships
with your name on 'em?

1159
01:15:44,750 --> 01:15:45,832
I don't own 'em.

1160
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:48,957
I mean, my name is good
in the business and all, and...

1161
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:51,291
dealers choose to use 'em, but...

1162
01:15:51,375 --> 01:15:54,291
they'll pull that shit as soon
as it stops working for 'em.

1163
01:15:54,875 --> 01:15:56,875
I'm telling you,
I ain't got a pot to piss in

1164
01:15:56,957 --> 01:15:59,916
or a window to throw it out of.
And that's facts!

1165
01:16:04,416 --> 01:16:05,416
God damn.

1166
01:16:07,707 --> 01:16:08,707
Sorry, bro.

1167
01:16:11,375 --> 01:16:12,875
Can we just go find Norm?

1168
01:16:15,750 --> 01:16:17,500
Stormin' Norm's been waiting.

1169
01:16:26,875 --> 01:16:27,875
Damn.

1170
01:16:29,375 --> 01:16:30,832
Ain't that some doo-doo.

1171
01:16:42,166 --> 01:16:43,625
[beeping]

1172
01:16:56,166 --> 01:16:57,416
[camera shutter clicking]

1173
01:17:04,207 --> 01:17:05,250
[beeping rapidly]

1174
01:17:06,250 --> 01:17:10,082
Hey, Bloods, I got something!
Right here I got... I'm getting a big hit.

1175
01:17:10,875 --> 01:17:13,125
- I'm getting a big hit, right here.
- Are you sure?

1176
01:17:13,207 --> 01:17:17,125
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's all over,
right in here. Right in this whole area.

1177
01:17:19,166 --> 01:17:20,416
[Paul grunting]

1178
01:17:23,666 --> 01:17:25,625
[Melvin] It's a big hit.
Right here. Right here.

1179
01:17:26,957 --> 01:17:28,457
Right in here, baby. Right in there.

1180
01:17:53,916 --> 01:17:55,541
Oh, my God! Oh, God!

1181
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:04,541
That's...

1182
01:18:07,375 --> 01:18:08,541
Shit.

1183
01:18:15,957 --> 01:18:16,957
It's Norm.

1184
01:18:19,207 --> 01:18:20,582
Oh, brother.

1185
01:18:29,666 --> 01:18:30,875
[Paul panting]

1186
01:18:54,332 --> 01:18:55,375
[Otis] It's Norm?

1187
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,916
- Yeah, it's Norm.
- [Otis] Oh, shit.

1188
01:19:00,457 --> 01:19:02,582
[Eddie panting and grunting]

1189
01:19:13,916 --> 01:19:15,375
[Otis] Okay. Okay.

1190
01:19:15,916 --> 01:19:17,832
[Eddie] Holy shit. Come on. [voice breaks]

1191
01:19:21,291 --> 01:19:23,332
Shit. Shit.

1192
01:19:29,125 --> 01:19:30,125
Shit.

1193
01:19:32,666 --> 01:19:33,750
[Paul] Hey, Norm.

1194
01:19:35,541 --> 01:19:36,625
We all here, man.

1195
01:19:38,332 --> 01:19:41,166
Otis, Melvin, Eddie.

1196
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:47,666
I got my son, David. Right here.

1197
01:19:51,457 --> 01:19:53,791
Took us a little longer
than we thought, but...

1198
01:19:55,250 --> 01:19:57,582
we came back like we said we would.

1199
01:20:01,166 --> 01:20:04,541
But this time when we get on that plane,
that Freedom Bird,

1200
01:20:05,125 --> 01:20:06,666
going back to the world,

1201
01:20:08,375 --> 01:20:11,957
you are coming with us, brother.
You coming with us, brother.

1202
01:20:15,082 --> 01:20:17,250
Now, both of your parents have passed,

1203
01:20:17,332 --> 01:20:23,666
I guess you know that, but your sisters,
Janet and Kim, will be waiting for us...

1204
01:20:28,166 --> 01:20:29,957
when we land, brother.

1205
01:20:34,875 --> 01:20:37,291
You goin' home, Blood.

1206
01:20:41,291 --> 01:20:42,666
You're goin' home, Blood.

1207
01:20:49,082 --> 01:20:50,416
Come on, now.

1208
01:21:10,207 --> 01:21:11,416
Blessed holy God.

1209
01:21:14,125 --> 01:21:16,457
We come around
your mighty throne of grace...

1210
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:19,500
to thank you for this day.

1211
01:21:23,416 --> 01:21:28,750
We thank you for the reunion
of family... and friendship...

1212
01:21:30,541 --> 01:21:31,750
and the brotherhood.

1213
01:21:34,957 --> 01:21:39,625
Continuing in prayer, Lord,
we ask you for traveling grace...

1214
01:21:40,707 --> 01:21:42,041
and the mending of hearts.

1215
01:21:43,791 --> 01:21:46,207
In your son's righteous
and holy name, we pray.

1216
01:21:47,082 --> 01:21:48,875
<i>- Amen.</i>
- [all] <i>Amen.</i>

1217
01:21:48,957 --> 01:21:50,291
[cicadas chirping loudly]

1218
01:21:51,207 --> 01:21:52,791
Damn! What is that sound?

1219
01:21:54,332 --> 01:21:56,332
Uh, cicadas.

1220
01:21:57,791 --> 01:21:59,791
- Cicadas?
- Yeah.

1221
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:02,707
They don't sound like that back home.

1222
01:22:04,291 --> 01:22:05,625
We ain't home, son.

1223
01:22:08,166 --> 01:22:09,166
We ain't home.

1224
01:22:11,207 --> 01:22:12,375
[gold bars clinking]

1225

[grunts]

1226
01:22:39,416 --> 01:22:42,375
- [David] You all right?
- [Paul] Yeah, yeah, yeah. [pants]

1227
01:22:51,875 --> 01:22:54,250
[Paul] Hey, son, get this off of me, man.

1228
01:22:56,416 --> 01:22:57,416
[Otis grunting]

1229
01:23:01,125 --> 01:23:02,184
- [Paul] All right.
- [David] I got it.

1230
01:23:02,207 --> 01:23:04,408
- [Paul] Just let it drop.
- [David] Let it go. [grunts]

1231
01:23:06,541 --> 01:23:07,832
Hand me my water, man.

1232
01:23:10,250 --> 01:23:11,082
[David] Hydrate.

1233
01:23:11,166 --> 01:23:12,605
- [Melvin] Lord have mercy.
- My man.

1234
01:23:14,707 --> 01:23:17,125
Hey, I can manage another 30, 40 pounds.

1235
01:23:17,625 --> 01:23:19,207
- Yeah.
- That be just great, bud.

1236
01:23:19,291 --> 01:23:22,791
My son play the pack mule,
my son gets a fair share.

1237
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:27,041
- It's fine, Dad. It's fine.
- No, the hell it is.

1238
01:23:27,666 --> 01:23:30,375
When did you turn into a grade-A,
first-rate, certified,

1239
01:23:30,457 --> 01:23:32,332
old, tired and crazy motherfucker?

1240
01:23:32,416 --> 01:23:33,625
Ah, fuck you, man.

1241
01:23:35,707 --> 01:23:38,041
When you've been cheated in life
as much as I have,

1242
01:23:38,541 --> 01:23:42,416
you learn to spot the sign of all them
dirty rat bastards out there.

1243
01:23:42,957 --> 01:23:45,375
- How much you need, huh? [grunts]
- [Paul] Huh?

1244
01:23:47,332 --> 01:23:49,250
That enough? You want more?

1245
01:23:49,332 --> 01:23:51,750
- Man, get that out of my fucking face.
- Huh?

1246
01:23:53,332 --> 01:23:54,416
Do you remember?

1247
01:23:56,457 --> 01:23:58,500
You remember what Norm said about money?

1248
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,416
I don't remember that.

1249
01:24:06,207 --> 01:24:10,332
No, no, no. I am sick and tired

1250
01:24:10,916 --> 01:24:13,832
of trying to get you fools
to love one another.

1251
01:24:13,916 --> 01:24:18,125
Go ahead! You wanna
tear each other apart, go on. Go on!

1252
01:24:19,250 --> 01:24:20,625
Here I thought...

1253
01:24:20,707 --> 01:24:24,166
I hoped that we could be Bloods
one more time.

1254
01:24:24,666 --> 01:24:27,457
But, no, that ain't gonna never
happen again because of this.

1255
01:24:28,666 --> 01:24:33,250
Traded brotherhood for this shit.
Right, Paul?

1256
01:24:33,332 --> 01:24:35,500
That motherfucker
walks backward pigeon-toed.

1257
01:24:35,582 --> 01:24:39,500
"Eddie, you black as a damn crow
Ain't white like snow

1258
01:24:39,582 --> 01:24:40,832
And if you didn't know

1259
01:24:40,916 --> 01:24:43,250
If you ain't got no dough
Then you don't go

1260
01:24:43,332 --> 01:24:44,875
And that's for damn sure"

1261
01:24:45,916 --> 01:24:48,957
- Yeah, well, my mama told me...
- [Paul laughing]

1262
01:24:49,707 --> 01:24:53,457
...that money is the root of all...

1263
01:24:54,582 --> 01:24:56,082
- [Melvin] Oh, shit!
- [Paul groans]

1264
01:24:56,791 --> 01:24:58,166
- Oh, my God!
- What the fuck?

1265
01:24:58,250 --> 01:24:59,916
[Eddie screaming]

1266
01:25:02,416 --> 01:25:03,250
Eddie.

1267
01:25:03,332 --> 01:25:05,207
- [Melvin] Fuck.
- Oh! What?

1268
01:25:05,291 --> 01:25:07,350
- Otis, don't move! It's a minefield!
- [Otis] Eddie!

1269
01:25:07,375 --> 01:25:08,457
It's a minefield!

1270
01:25:08,541 --> 01:25:10,957
- [Eddie screaming]
- [Melvin] Don't move, Otis.

1271
01:25:18,250 --> 01:25:20,375
- Okay, okay, okay. Shh.
- [groaning]

1272
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:24,625
[Otis] I got you. I got you. I got you.

1273
01:25:24,707 --> 01:25:27,166
- I got you. I got you.
- [whimpers]

1274
01:25:31,791 --> 01:25:34,082
- I got you.
- Bloods.

1275
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,041
[click]

1276
01:25:48,582 --> 01:25:49,750
[David] Jesus!

1277
01:25:52,791 --> 01:25:54,207
- Jesus!
- What?

1278
01:25:54,291 --> 01:25:56,625
Jesus! Dad! Dad!
I think I stepped on something.

1279
01:25:56,707 --> 01:25:59,666
- [Paul] Whoa! Stay right there.
- [David] Motherfucker!

1280
01:25:59,750 --> 01:26:01,416
David, don't move. Don't move.

1281
01:26:05,291 --> 01:26:07,166
- [Hedy] David!
- [Paul] Hey!

1282
01:26:07,250 --> 01:26:08,766
- [Hedy] Everybody freeze!
- [Simon] Everybody okay?

1283
01:26:08,791 --> 01:26:09,625
Hey!

1284
01:26:09,707 --> 01:26:13,416
Dad, no, no! Put it down!
Put it down! They can help!

1285
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:17,291
- We were just walking back to our camp.
- [Otis] He stepped on something.

1286
01:26:17,375 --> 01:26:20,582
- Is it a pressure plate?
- Well, if it was, he would be dead.

1287
01:26:20,666 --> 01:26:24,250
Uh, maybe it's a dud. Or maybe it's not.

1288
01:26:24,332 --> 01:26:27,082
- We can help you. Look! Look! He can help.
- [device beeps]

1289
01:26:30,875 --> 01:26:32,082
Okay, come on.

1290
01:26:38,082 --> 01:26:41,082
And, David... don't move.

1291
01:26:42,416 --> 01:26:43,916
What are we gonna do about my son?

1292
01:26:44,457 --> 01:26:48,332
Well, all he can do is lift up his foot
and pray to God it doesn't explode.

1293
01:26:49,957 --> 01:26:52,082
There's gotta be something else we can do.

1294
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,500
Well, if there is, I don't know it.

1295
01:26:54,582 --> 01:26:57,875
Fuck. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1296
01:27:01,125 --> 01:27:02,125
Jethro Bodine.

1297
01:27:02,666 --> 01:27:04,291
- What?
- Who?

1298
01:27:04,791 --> 01:27:07,166
Remember that big ol' hillbilly kid
from Oklahoma?

1299
01:27:07,250 --> 01:27:09,291
He stepped on a toe popper. Remember?

1300
01:27:09,375 --> 01:27:11,832
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1301
01:27:11,916 --> 01:27:13,666
Okay, we're gonna spring my son...

1302
01:27:14,207 --> 01:27:16,916
the same way we sprung
that hillbilly kid, you got me?

1303
01:27:17,457 --> 01:27:19,057
[Otis] Yeah, that'll work. That'll work.

1304
01:27:19,666 --> 01:27:20,666
Give me that rope.

1305
01:27:26,166 --> 01:27:28,207
Where am I walking? Where am I walking?

1306
01:27:28,707 --> 01:27:30,791
Straight to me, I swept it. You're good.
You're good.

1307
01:27:33,332 --> 01:27:37,875
Do us both a favor.
Don't fucking shift your weight, okay?

1308
01:27:38,541 --> 01:27:39,832
Stay right where you are.

1309
01:27:39,916 --> 01:27:43,416
David, I want you to take this rope.

1310
01:27:44,582 --> 01:27:49,625
I want you to wrap this rope
around your body. Two times.

1311
01:27:49,707 --> 01:27:53,207
Go ahead. Twice around your body.

1312
01:27:53,916 --> 01:27:57,291
Go on, like that. There you go.

1313
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:03,791
High as you can, man.
High as you can. Right.

1314
01:28:16,582 --> 01:28:17,666
[David grunts]

1315
01:28:29,207 --> 01:28:33,541
David look at me.
Where did you go to college?

1316
01:28:36,541 --> 01:28:38,457
- The House.
- The House.

1317
01:28:39,250 --> 01:28:40,582
Who went to The House?

1318
01:28:42,957 --> 01:28:45,916
- Come on.
- Edwin Moses. The class of '78.

1319
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:49,041
- Come on. What he'd do?
- Won two Olympic gold medals.

1320
01:28:49,125 --> 01:28:51,041
- Yeah.
- Four hundred meter hurdles.

1321
01:28:51,125 --> 01:28:55,250
He took 13 steps between each hurdle.
Everybody else took 15.

1322
01:28:57,125 --> 01:29:01,082
David, that man could fly.

1323
01:29:02,791 --> 01:29:04,125
What you gonna do?

1324
01:29:05,750 --> 01:29:07,416
- What you gonna do, David?
- Fly.

1325
01:29:08,125 --> 01:29:09,957
- Like?
- Fly like Moses.

1326
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,500
I want everybody
to take a piece of this rope.

1327
01:29:18,582 --> 01:29:22,041
Back on up. Otis, back on up.

1328
01:29:23,041 --> 01:29:26,625
Back it on up, man.
You, too, Mel. Back it on up.

1329
01:29:26,707 --> 01:29:27,707
All right.

1330
01:29:34,832 --> 01:29:36,791
- Here, take this.
- [Paul] That's good, big man.

1331
01:29:36,875 --> 01:29:38,707
- That's good, big man! Right there.
- Yeah.

1332
01:29:38,791 --> 01:29:40,000
Fuck. Fuck.

1333
01:29:40,082 --> 01:29:42,375
- [Melvin] Get that slack!
- [Paul] Tighten up!

1334
01:29:45,791 --> 01:29:49,207
Now, everybody...

1335
01:29:51,250 --> 01:29:53,457
you get an armful and a handful of rope.

1336
01:29:56,332 --> 01:29:57,957
- We good?
- We good.

1337
01:29:58,041 --> 01:29:59,125
[Simon] I hear you.

1338
01:29:59,207 --> 01:30:03,541
On count of three,
you pull harder than a motherfucker!

1339
01:30:03,625 --> 01:30:04,625
[Otis] Yeah, baby.

1340
01:30:05,457 --> 01:30:06,291
You got me?

1341
01:30:06,375 --> 01:30:08,184
- [Otis] We got you, Blood.
- [Melvin] Got you.

1342
01:30:08,207 --> 01:30:09,207
All right.

1343
01:30:12,916 --> 01:30:14,082
One...

1344
01:30:15,541 --> 01:30:16,582
two...

1345
01:30:18,041 --> 01:30:19,041
three!

1346
01:30:19,082 --> 01:30:20,332
[David screams]

1347
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:22,207
- Come on, man.
- [whimpers]

1348
01:30:22,291 --> 01:30:23,916
[screaming]

1349
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,875
- [Otis] God is great.
- [grunting]

1350
01:30:30,457 --> 01:30:31,457
[Paul] Okay.

1351
01:30:38,416 --> 01:30:39,875
All right. Now...

1352
01:30:41,166 --> 01:30:43,332
- [Melvin] What the fuck?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1353
01:30:43,416 --> 01:30:46,707
Get on your knees. If you get...
Get on your fucking knees.

1354
01:30:46,791 --> 01:30:49,457
- Dad.
- Put that damn gun down now!

1355
01:30:49,541 --> 01:30:50,875
We're compromised, Melvin.

1356
01:30:51,457 --> 01:30:54,375
Okay, okay, okay. Just take it easy now.

1357
01:30:54,457 --> 01:30:57,832
Whatever you're doing,
it's none of our business. We can just go.

1358
01:30:57,916 --> 01:31:01,500
Otis, the sound of those blasts
traveled, man.

1359
01:31:02,125 --> 01:31:04,041
Somebody is on their way here right now.

1360
01:31:04,125 --> 01:31:06,600
- We gotta get the gold and get outta here.
- [Melvin] You serious?

1361
01:31:06,625 --> 01:31:08,516
- We gotta get somebody for Eddie, Dad.
- Hey, man.

1362
01:31:08,541 --> 01:31:10,000
American Embassy. Somebody.

1363
01:31:10,082 --> 01:31:13,791
- We can't tell nobody nothing.
- Just slow the fuck down, man.

1364
01:31:13,875 --> 01:31:15,166
We have to bury Eddie.

1365
01:31:15,250 --> 01:31:18,082
Are you deaf, man?
Are you deaf? Are you deaf?

1366
01:31:18,166 --> 01:31:19,750
We gotta get out of here, Otis!

1367
01:31:19,832 --> 01:31:22,291
- I'm not leaving Eddie like that!
- I can be helpful to you.

1368
01:31:22,791 --> 01:31:25,916
You can be helpful? Okay.

1369
01:31:27,541 --> 01:31:30,207
Can you bring back the dead? Huh?

1370
01:31:31,750 --> 01:31:34,207
- Get the rope, tie 'em up.
- [David] Not doing it.

1371
01:31:34,291 --> 01:31:35,666
Let's just talk about it.

1372
01:31:35,750 --> 01:31:38,916
Otis, you ain't giving the orders, man.
I'm running shit now.

1373
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,832
[Paul grunting]

1374
01:31:42,416 --> 01:31:44,125
Dad! Dad!

1375
01:31:44,207 --> 01:31:47,832
Dad nothing. Dad nothing. Dad nothing!

1376
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:51,416
[panting]

1377
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:55,582
Boy, I've killed far better men than you,

1378
01:31:55,666 --> 01:31:59,916
and I will not hesitate
to plug a hole in you right now.

1379
01:32:01,541 --> 01:32:04,207
David, tie 'em up.

1380
01:32:06,207 --> 01:32:07,207
[coughing]

1381
01:32:07,957 --> 01:32:11,791
You want your share? Tie 'em up.

1382
01:32:13,082 --> 01:32:14,666
You wanna remain my son?

1383
01:32:17,250 --> 01:32:20,582
Get at it. Get at it.

1384
01:32:26,375 --> 01:32:28,166
Come here, son. Come here. Come here.

1385
01:32:29,457 --> 01:32:31,291
- All right.
- [David] Give me your hand.

1386
01:32:35,082 --> 01:32:36,332
You had me fooled.

1387
01:32:44,875 --> 01:32:50,250
You got something to say?
You say it to me. Not my son.

1388
01:32:58,416 --> 01:32:59,832
Let me tell y'all something.

1389
01:33:00,416 --> 01:33:01,791
I'm the motherfucker.

1390
01:33:03,291 --> 01:33:05,916
I... am the motherfucker.

1391
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:09,207
I'm the motherfucker.
I'm the motherfucker.

1392
01:33:16,791 --> 01:33:18,125
So long, Blood.

1393
01:33:19,625 --> 01:33:20,957
Rest in power.

1394
01:33:23,582 --> 01:33:24,582
Amen.

1395
01:33:25,375 --> 01:33:26,375
- Amen.
- Amen.

1396
01:33:30,416 --> 01:33:32,541
We should give Eddie's share
to his family.

1397
01:33:34,625 --> 01:33:36,332
It's the right thing to do, y'all.

1398
01:33:39,666 --> 01:33:40,666
And David?

1399
01:33:43,791 --> 01:33:46,041
That's my boy. He deserves a fair share.

1400
01:33:50,082 --> 01:33:51,082
Deal?

1401
01:33:53,207 --> 01:33:54,832
- [together] Deal.
- All right.

1402
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:30,125
[Seppo] I can't believe I was actually...
jealous of you, back at that bar.

1403
01:34:30,957 --> 01:34:34,707
Yeah. You seemed
so fuckin' sure of yourself.

1404
01:34:35,541 --> 01:34:40,500
Should've known you're actually
just a spineless fucking rat.

1405
01:34:41,166 --> 01:34:45,750
Hedy, you can't still want this guy.
Look at him, his father's gonna kill us.

1406
01:34:45,832 --> 01:34:47,082
Seppo, shut up.

1407
01:34:47,707 --> 01:34:50,291
Well, your father scares me
more than landmines.

1408
01:34:50,832 --> 01:34:52,457
[Paul] Shut the hell up, up there.

1409
01:34:57,041 --> 01:34:58,582
- Yeah, over here.
- Here?

1410
01:34:58,666 --> 01:34:59,707
[Otis] Mmm-hmm.

1411
01:35:01,250 --> 01:35:03,250
Take us about a day, and we get to...

1412
01:35:09,582 --> 01:35:13,166
You be careful with this OxyContin shit.
It can be addictive.

1413
01:35:14,791 --> 01:35:15,832
[chuckles]

1414
01:35:20,375 --> 01:35:23,166
- Where were we?
- What about right here?

1415
01:35:23,250 --> 01:35:25,957
- But I think that Vinh should...
- Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm.

1416
01:35:26,625 --> 01:35:29,582
Vinh is out. He in cahoots with Charlie.

1417
01:35:32,125 --> 01:35:33,457
Ain't that right, traitor?

1418
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
If you don't trust me by now...

1419
01:35:40,582 --> 01:35:44,375
just shoot me... when you kill them.

1420
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,000
What the hell is that?

1421
01:35:55,916 --> 01:36:00,541
Night vision, baby. Night vision.
Let's see what's shaking.

1422
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:06,082
I need to urinate.

1423
01:36:07,332 --> 01:36:10,541
- She needs to pee.
- Yeah, I heard her. I'm not deaf.

1424
01:36:11,250 --> 01:36:13,875
Yeah, I know the Geneva Convention's
off the table,

1425
01:36:13,957 --> 01:36:15,582
but maybe just let her take a piss.

1426
01:36:16,457 --> 01:36:20,000
Well, could you untie my hands? Please.

1427
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:21,875
You gotta go, you gotta go.

1428
01:36:25,541 --> 01:36:26,582
Fast, all right?

1429
01:36:32,791 --> 01:36:33,875
[in French]

1430
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,840
- [in English] To the tree.
- [speaking French]

1431
01:36:40,666 --> 01:36:45,082
[in English] David, don't you want
the first time I unzip and remove my pants

1432
01:36:45,166 --> 01:36:47,041
to be under better circumstances?

1433
01:36:48,541 --> 01:36:49,791
[urinating]

1434
01:36:49,875 --> 01:36:50,916
[Hedy exclaims]

1435
01:36:52,457 --> 01:36:53,957
[Hedy sighs in relief]

1436
01:36:54,041 --> 01:36:58,707
Were you flirting with me the other night
because you were looking for an easy fuck

1437
01:36:58,791 --> 01:37:01,332
or because you were
actually interested in me?

1438
01:37:01,875 --> 01:37:05,041
- Actually, I'm interested.
- Uh-huh?

1439
01:37:08,875 --> 01:37:14,750
Yeah. You left your wealthy family behind
to do something good, help people, kids.

1440
01:37:17,541 --> 01:37:20,332
And you're fine, too. I ain't gonna lie.

1441
01:37:21,250 --> 01:37:24,166
Wow. Then let me go. [chuckles]

1442
01:37:26,041 --> 01:37:30,250
Give me a ten-minute head start.
All I ask, please?

1443
01:37:32,541 --> 01:37:33,541
Hmm?

1444
01:37:34,166 --> 01:37:38,416
You know, I hate to cockblock.
She cute, though.

1445
01:37:40,582 --> 01:37:42,166
Mel, take her back to the tree.

1446
01:37:43,291 --> 01:37:45,375
You better listen to your pop, son.

1447
01:37:45,457 --> 01:37:49,332
You're a worthless fuck. Just so you know,
I was only trying to escape.

1448
01:37:49,416 --> 01:37:51,582
I wouldn't fuck you
for all the gold in the world.

1449
01:37:51,666 --> 01:37:52,832
[in French]

1450
01:37:55,875 --> 01:37:56,875
[Paul laughing]

1451
01:38:13,750 --> 01:38:17,582
Just what I thought. Just what I thought.

1452
01:38:25,625 --> 01:38:28,125
Mel, you make sure that rope is tight.

1453
01:38:28,207 --> 01:38:30,000
- [Melvin] Oh, yeah.
- [David] Hey, Dad.

1454
01:38:30,666 --> 01:38:31,791
Okay. Okay.

1455
01:38:32,416 --> 01:38:33,766
- [Paul groans] God damn!
- [David] Get the gun!

1456
01:38:33,791 --> 01:38:35,430
- [Paul] God damn!
- [Otis] I got the gun.

1457
01:38:35,500 --> 01:38:37,875
Drag his ass over there.
Drag his ass over there.

1458
01:38:37,957 --> 01:38:39,766
- Seppo's loose! Give me the gun!
- [Paul] Get him.

1459
01:38:39,791 --> 01:38:42,082
- [Otis] I'll crack your head open!
- [Seppo panting]

1460
01:38:43,457 --> 01:38:46,707
[Paul groans] I knew it! I knew it!

1461
01:38:46,791 --> 01:38:51,707
[laughs] Another motherfucking
dope fiend double-cross.

1462
01:38:52,832 --> 01:38:55,582
David, you don't see what Otis is doing?

1463
01:38:56,166 --> 01:38:59,250
You're playin' into his fuckin' hands!

1464
01:39:00,375 --> 01:39:03,332
Your dear mother would be ashamed of you!

1465
01:39:04,707 --> 01:39:08,207
Yeah, you ain't no fuckin' son of mine!

1466
01:39:09,250 --> 01:39:10,875
You're dead to me. You hear me?

1467
01:39:10,957 --> 01:39:13,082
- [Otis] Get the rope.
- [Paul] Gone! Buried!

1468
01:39:13,166 --> 01:39:15,225
- [Otis] Get the rope.
- [Paul] You're a fucking coward.

1469
01:39:15,250 --> 01:39:17,541
- Fucking disgrace!
- Get the rope! Get the rope, David.

1470
01:39:17,625 --> 01:39:20,666
Don't get shit. You stay your ass
right the fuck there.

1471
01:39:20,750 --> 01:39:23,957
You stay your ass right the fuck there!
[growls]

1472
01:39:48,457 --> 01:39:50,291
You've had quite an adventure.

1473
01:39:51,832 --> 01:39:53,582
- My friend, let me help.
- Oh, no.

1474
01:39:53,666 --> 01:39:56,000
I got it, I got it. Thank you.
Thank you, I got it.

1475
01:39:56,500 --> 01:39:57,500
Hey.

1476
01:39:58,791 --> 01:39:59,916
[panting]

1477
01:40:04,957 --> 01:40:06,041
[David grunts]

1478
01:40:08,125 --> 01:40:10,125
- Get this off of me.
- Where's Eddie?

1479
01:40:11,875 --> 01:40:15,750
[panting] Broke his ankle.
We left him with food and water.

1480
01:40:20,082 --> 01:40:21,541
He insisted.

1481
01:40:23,166 --> 01:40:25,250
That boy is stubborn as an old mule.

1482
01:40:29,957 --> 01:40:31,916
- [Vinh] Sounds very bad.
- [Otis] Yeah.

1483
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:33,916
I knew you should not have gone alone.

1484
01:40:35,082 --> 01:40:37,916
I have a friend in the district.
He'll send a rescue group.

1485
01:40:38,457 --> 01:40:41,957
How would you like to earn more money
than you ever earned in your whole life?

1486
01:40:47,750 --> 01:40:49,582
Eddie didn't break an ankle, did he?

1487
01:40:51,625 --> 01:40:53,207
No. Help me.

1488
01:40:55,375 --> 01:40:56,375
You kill him?

1489
01:40:57,250 --> 01:40:58,291
Oh, God, no.

1490
01:41:00,416 --> 01:41:01,416
Minefield.

1491
01:41:02,125 --> 01:41:03,250
Otis!

1492
01:41:03,332 --> 01:41:04,791
- Huh?
- Here come your partners.

1493
01:41:09,916 --> 01:41:11,235
[Otis] Ain't no partners of mine.

1494
01:41:11,791 --> 01:41:12,791
[Seppo] Hedy!

1495
01:41:13,582 --> 01:41:15,332
- Hedy!
- [Hedy] Seppo!

1496
01:41:15,416 --> 01:41:16,750
[Simon] Seppo! Seppo!

1497
01:41:16,916 --> 01:41:19,791
[man grunts, speaks in Vietnamese]

1498
01:41:20,582 --> 01:41:24,041
[in Vietnamese]

1499
01:41:25,166 --> 01:41:27,926
- [in English] He said you have his gold.
- [Paul speaking Vietnamese]

1500
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,000
[in English] Forget that.

1501
01:41:30,416 --> 01:41:32,750
[in English] We trade
your friend for gold.

1502
01:41:32,832 --> 01:41:33,832
He ain't our friend!

1503
01:41:33,916 --> 01:41:35,541
- What?
- You heard me.

1504
01:41:35,625 --> 01:41:38,500
Hedy, for God's sakes, help me.

1505
01:41:38,582 --> 01:41:40,207
[Hedy] David, you've got to help him.

1506
01:41:41,207 --> 01:41:42,291
Otis?

1507
01:41:43,582 --> 01:41:44,582
Please.

1508
01:41:49,291 --> 01:41:50,666
We want him alive.

1509
01:42:03,541 --> 01:42:05,000
- Fuck!
- Fuck.

1510
01:42:07,916 --> 01:42:08,957
[Otis] We can share.

1511
01:42:09,041 --> 01:42:10,500
[men speaking Vietnamese]

1512
01:42:10,582 --> 01:42:12,416
There's enough for everybody.

1513
01:42:12,500 --> 01:42:14,332
[in Vietnamese]

1514
01:42:17,791 --> 01:42:18,791
What's he saying?

1515
01:42:19,750 --> 01:42:20,916
[in English] I like you.

1516
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:25,625
Black Uncle Sam. We share.

1517
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,957
- This for you, rest for us.
- [David] Hey!

1518
01:42:30,041 --> 01:42:31,560
Look, man, we're Americans, all right?

1519
01:42:31,625 --> 01:42:35,625
You kill us or hurt him, you got
an international fiasco on your hands.

1520
01:42:35,707 --> 01:42:39,041
We're not gonna kill anyone... yet.

1521
01:42:40,332 --> 01:42:41,332
[Otis] You heard him.

1522
01:42:41,791 --> 01:42:43,875
Nobody gets nothing. Nothing!

1523
01:42:44,375 --> 01:42:49,750
Black Uncle Sam, this is belong
to Vietnamese people.

1524
01:42:50,500 --> 01:42:51,707
We take what is ours.

1525
01:42:51,791 --> 01:42:53,707
Hey, boy, you ain't taking what's ours.

1526
01:42:53,791 --> 01:42:58,000
You look on that gold bar right there,
it says USA, my friend.

1527
01:42:58,082 --> 01:43:00,000
You, USA?

1528
01:43:00,082 --> 01:43:01,082
Damn skippy.

1529
01:43:02,166 --> 01:43:05,332
- It say USA, but I don't think so.
- Well, you better believe it.

1530
01:43:06,332 --> 01:43:07,875
Who the fuck are you, man?

1531
01:43:08,791 --> 01:43:10,582
- [man] We?
- Uh-huh. You.

1532
01:43:10,666 --> 01:43:11,750
Vietnam officer.

1533
01:43:11,832 --> 01:43:14,375
Oh, yeah? Where are your official badges?

It. Calley. Ever heard of My Lai?

Ain't nothing to it but to do it, Blood.

[Vinh] Brother.

We have very little gas left.

Perhaps enough gas
to get to the temple ruin.

- A few miles from here.
- [Otis] What do we achieve by that, huh?

1617
01:47:36,916 --> 01:47:39,916
If you wanna choose to fight these men,
you need some defenses.

1618
01:47:40,707 --> 01:47:45,916
Otis, try doing the math, huh?
Tiên is with the V.C.

1619
01:47:46,541 --> 01:47:49,332
Otis, that's how they knew
about the gold, man.

That's how this whole fucking ambush
was a setup! Mel?

No, I do not.

1623

And you expect him to tell the truth.

1624
01:48:00,832 --> 01:48:04,250
Okay, look here. Look here, man. Okay.

1625
01:48:05,041 --> 01:48:07,500
We gonna cut through the jungle
to a river.

1626
01:48:08,582 --> 01:48:12,916
To a village, Hng Ng.
Right there, Hng Ng.

1627
01:48:13,707 --> 01:48:16,291
Wait till nightfall.
We gonna rip off a boat,

- Tân Châu.

We can't go there.
That's 20 miles away from here.

1631
01:48:23,750 --> 01:48:27,582
So what? You scared of
a little bit of exercise, fat boy? Huh?

1632
01:48:27,666 --> 01:48:29,582
[Otis] David's leg won't handle that.

1633
01:48:29,666 --> 01:48:33,041
[voice breaks]
David ain't my problem... anymore.

Man, David is your son.

- That's right. He wouldn't.

1641
01:49:09,457 --> 01:49:14,000
And that's my problem. Ah.
That's my problem, Otis.

He stepped on a landmine.
