<i>"The impulse had become
irresistible.</i>

3
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,450
<i>There was only one answer to
the fury that tortured him,</i>

4
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:21,200
<i>and so he committed his
first act of murder.</i>

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,550
<i>He had broken the most
deep rooted taboo</i>

6
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:35,150
<i>and found not guilt, not
anxiety or fear, but freedom.</i>

7
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,140
<i>Every humiliation which
stood in his way...</i>

8
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:49,170

simple act...</i>

PETER NEAL:
Thanks, John. Take care of
everything while I'm gone.

11
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,700
Have a good trip, Mr. Neal.
Flight 401 to Rome.

12
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,800
See you inside the check in.

proceed to Gate 7.</i>

<i>Mr. Peter Neal, passenger to Rome.
Mr. Peter Neal to the Information Desk.</i>

15
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,750
Miss, excuse me, Peter Neal.
Do you have a message for me?

16
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:01,750
Yes, there was a call,
you can pick a phone over there.

17
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:12,960
Thank you.
Hello?  Yeah!  Yeah.

18
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,410
Well, listen, Jane,

19
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:18,320
listen to me. Yeah. The reason why--
The reason why I haven't...

20
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:23,200
seen you for six weeks is because
I--  Yeah. Jane,

21
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,200
take it easy!
Would you  just take it easy?

22
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,600
Look, I'm going to hang up on you.
Do you hear me?  I'm just going to hang up on you.

23
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,000
Right tomorrow. Yeah, tomorrow.

24
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:36,550
I'll try to call tomorrow.
Okay. Yeah. Bye.

25
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,090
Oh, Excuse me.

26
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,530
- Open your bag!  Open it!  I said, "Open it!"
- Leave me alone.

27
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:47,710
- Come with me! I said come with me!
- Leave Me alone.

28
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,300
I want to look in your bag!

29
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,100
Do you have a receipt for this one?

30
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,410
I was going to the cashier
to pay for it!

31
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:57,400
You told me you didn't
have a book.

32
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,900
Hey, what do you see? Who the fuck are you?
I was only going to pay for it!

33
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,900
Please come along with me
to my office, will you? This way!

34
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,500
Oh!  Oh, I don't come in,
I'm called in.

35
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,440
Elsa Manny, 12 convictions
for shop lifting.

36
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,430
You should have learned by now!

37
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:22,400
Okay, listen.
We can make a deal.

38
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,540
You, uh,  just take the paper back,
for Christ's sake.

39
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:31,900
I'll give you my address,
for later, I mean, any time.

40
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:36,620
Come on, give me a break.
You're not gay, are you?

41
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,700
Where do you live?

42
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,860
Here in Rome, Number 14
Via delle Camene.

43
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:46,090
Via - delle - Camene.  Okay!

44
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,530
Thanks!

45
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:15,000

<i>We are approaching the coast of Greenland.
We expect to land in Rome in approximately 5 hours.</i>

Hey!  Hey!  Hey!

47
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,400
Hey, come here.

48
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,700
Hey, hey, girl, back!

49
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,090
Come back!  Hey, hey, come here!

50
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,880
Ah, you hit me!  You bitch!
I'll kill you, huh?

51
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,430
Come here, back here!

52
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:09,640
Hi Carla.  Hi, my washing machine
just broke.  Are you okay?

53
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,410
I am, now...

54
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:13,880
fine, thank you!

55
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:47,400
- Did everybody get this release?
- Let's try anywhere.

56
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:51,640
TILDA: Am I too late?
BULLMER: No, did you get this release?

57
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,200
PETER:
Come on, look at you!  You're getting
prettier every time I see you!

58
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,650
Are you still writing nice
things about me, huh?

59
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:22,450
Getting my notes together usually takes me
I would say about a month.

60
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,400
And the actual writing...
actual writing about three months.

61
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,520
- Hi.
- Hi Tilda.

62
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:31,350
Yeah, two months
for revisions, rewrites, proofs.

63
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:36,210
So, 3 books in a row means I haven't
stopped for almost two years now.

64
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,230
Tenebrae is a sexist novel.

65
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,650
Why do you despise women so much?

66
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,530
Sexist?!
Oh, No.  I don't think it's sexist.

67
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:46,910
Women as victims, ciphers,

68
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,370
the male heros with their
hairy macho bullshit,

69
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,350
how can you say it isn't sexist?

70
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,700
Tilda, what's the matter with you?

71
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,540
You've known me for 10 years
ever since you studied in New York.

72
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:00,320
- You know very well that I--
- Look, I'm talking about work!

73
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,550
Well, I don't know.
Would you like me to tell you...

74
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:09,810
that I... support to the equal
rights amendment?

75
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:12,350
Okay, so then explain the books.

76
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,390
Do you write to a fixed pattern?

77
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:18,700
Or do your publishers tell you
this kind of sexism sales copies?

78
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,500
Miss, why don't we do this?

79
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:28,440
Setup a separate interview
with you and Mr. Neal,

80
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,700
and let him really come the
grips with your magazine's attitude, huh?

81
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,900
He just got off the plane and--
Well, how would that be?

82
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,430
- Okay.
- I, uh--  I think it's time.

83
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:41,200
Uh-huh.
Have a good day!

84
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,850
We just gonna slip out.

85
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,200
You all are welcome to drink
the bar dry.

86
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,720
Thank you very much for your
attention and your interest.

87
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:51,250
Oh, by the way, call me tomorrow and
we'll setup a meeting!

88
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,900
[SAYING BYE IN ITALIAN]

89
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,200
Hey, my mother was hoping
you to call.

90
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,340
Tell her I will.
I'd love to see her!

91
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,750
- You know that you're getting very tense?
- I'm learning.

92
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:08,850
Those guys just want your balls...

93
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,490
because they haven't, after all.

94
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,400
- What is that?
- The hat you mean?

95
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,600
Bought it in a shop here in
Rome. Nice, eh? It suits me!

96
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,500
- Isn't it warm?
- No, try it!

97
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,450
No, no, no, no, no!  Doesn't it--?
Doesn't it drop off?

98
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,450
Drop off?

99
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,400
Yeah, I mean if you make
a quick movement, won't it slip off?

100
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,800
Look!

101
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,300
- That's a miracle!
- Drop off?!

102
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,200
You know, your book's been number one here,
on the best sellers for at least 12 weeks!

103
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:39,100
- Twelve weeks?
- Twelve, yeah, yeah.
- Already 12 weeks?  That's amazing, amazing!

104
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,800
- Pleased with your agent?
- Oh! Terrific, great, incredible, fantastic!

105
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,650
Come on, come on!
Say something nice about me!

106
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,150
Tell me, where is Anne
my secretary?

107
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50,800
Yeah, she's quite a girl that Anne.
6 days over here!

108
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,300
She's got the whole time wired for you
and got a great place for you this morning.

109
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,600
- She promised to meet me here.
- She's downstairs.

110
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,500
I didn't want them to think
you had an on to roach.

111
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,650
They love your books,
but they hate success!

112
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,350
Huh? That's interesting!
Very, very interesting!

113
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:06,450
Hey, Bullmer, there was a--
There was a fellow in the corner.

114
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,900
He was, eh--
Well, actually he never said a word.

115
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:12,470
- The tall thin guy?
- Yeah, that's it!

116
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,500
Cristiano Berti, he's a book
reviewer on Channel One TV.

117
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,600
He is a big fan of yours.
And we take the show with him... Thursday.

118
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,850
Oh, yeah!

119
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,400
- Ha-ha
ANNE: Peter!

120
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,350
How are you?

121
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,400
- Fine, how are you?
- Oh, I'm great!

122
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,000
Peter?  Peter, this is Gianni.
Gianni, this is Peter Neal.

123
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,610
- Hi, Mr. Neal.
 - I'm glad to meet you, Gianni.

124
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:45,900
This talented young man will some day be
an agent in the Rome office.

125
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,280
In the meantime, he's gonna look after
you during your staying here.

126
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,250
Ah-huh!

127
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,200
And in the meantime, you pay
more than promises, right?

128
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,800
See you tonight, alright?

129
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:03,120
- So--  Oh, I brought you a present.
- Oh, Peter!

130
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:04,920
Just a little thing!

131
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,000
Oh, God!

132
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,000
Who could have done such a thing?!

133
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,300
Here we go.
I'll take that, Gianni!

134
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,990
MAN:
Are you Peter Neal?

135
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,400
Mm-hm.  Yeah, that's me

136
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,200
Good evening!
I'm Captain Germani,

137
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,200
of the Rome Homicide Squad.

138
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,900
And this is Inspector Altieri.

139
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:56,450
I'm sorry, we didn't want to disturb you,
but the door was open!

140
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,500
- Right Inspector?
- It was open, that's correct!

141
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,050
I apologize, but a girl
was killed 5 hours ago.

142
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,520
A girl named Elsa Manni,
an inveterate shoplifter.

143
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,810
We wanted to know if you
knew her?

144
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,700
This is the first time I've
been to Rome.

145
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,000
She died from 4 deep wounds.

146
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:22,500
- Throat, chest and suffocation.
- Huh!

147
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,300
Her mouth was stuffed with
pages from a book, Tenebrae.

148
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:27,000
Tenebrae?!

149
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:33,200
Well, we came to check if you knew
of any connection.

150
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:35,000
I'll get you a drink.

151
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,450
Uh, just, uh-- just some water, please, Anne.
Thank you!

152
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,000
- Is it alright if I--
- Sure, go ahead!

153
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,770
Sorry to bother you, we were
just about to leave when...

154
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:47,550
- we heard the elevator!
- Well, I didn't know the girl, I'm sorry.

155
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,410
Thank you.

156
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,200
No!

157
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,400
I'd offer you something harder,
but you don't drink on duty, right?

158
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,450
Aeh, I only drink on duty
a scotch, please, straight up!

159
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,150
Okay.

160
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:04,050
You just arrived, Mr. Neal?
You mean, do I have an alibi?

161
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:09,500
Yes, I landed from New York
about 2 hours ago.

162
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,000
Can I ask you something?

163
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:15,000
If someone's killed with a
Smith & Wesson Revolver,

164
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,800
do you go and interview the
president of Smith & Wesson?

165
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,450
Ah-heh!
Thank you.

166
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:25,190
I've read all your books, Mr. Neal,
except this one.

167
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,900
Just started on it last night.

168
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,350
The book deals with a murder commited
with an old fashioned open razor, right?

169
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,550
Don't tell me who did it,
I haven't finished it yet!

170
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:40,580
This girl, too, was killed with a razor and
your books' pages stuffed into her mouth.

171
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,990
Ah!
We found this...

172
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,890
on the floor of your apartment here.
It's addressed to you!

173
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:04,200

the fury that tortured him."</i>

174

Isn't that a passage
from your book?

175
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,800
- Huh?
- Yes.  Yes, it is.

176
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,250
I respect you, Mr. Neal, believe me.
I don't want to make...

177
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:22,500
your stay in Rome a nightmare,
but we're going to need your help.

178

- Heh!  I'd like to keep the letter.
- Yes.

179
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,250
I think you'll get another
one some time,

180
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,250
and then another.

181
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,600
So, we'd be very grateful
 if you keep us informed.

182
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:46,300
Beautiful scotch,
but we won't keep you.

183
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,000
Inspector, please give them
a card.

184
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:54,400
Mr. Neal, if you get anything, anything at all,
you just call me on that number.  All right?

185
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,700
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

186
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:01,000
There is something else.
My travel bag in the bedroom.  Gianni!

187

uh, this morning, it was--

188
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,610
- Of course it wasn't like that.
- Hello, hello?

189
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:16,210
Mr. Neal, would you like me
to go and get you anything?

190
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:19,300
I mean I don't know what's being destroyed,
Shaving Kit, anything like that.

191
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,550
I'll make you a list.
Thanks.  Gianni!

192
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,300
- And do you mind if I take this?
- No, please go right ahead!

Maybe I could talk to you.

205

Who's with you?</i>

- Got away, hah?
- I couldn't get him.

210
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,500
I should have a tough male
assistant who runs fast.

- Poor Massimo,
when are you going to take my picture?
- Never, sweetheart!

213

Hey, he is cute.

He is vulgar and cheap.

216

I love you, Tilde.  But no jealousy.
You promised, okay?

217
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:22,890
Listen, he doesn't have a place,
so I'm taking him back to ours.

218
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:23,890
Oh, Christ!

I thought we agreed.

Okay. No ties, but you don't
have to rub my face in it.

Not your face, honey.
Not tonight.

Listen, just give me an hour!
Okay?

223
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:49,010
I'll see you later.

Okay.

Oh God, what a drag those

You make me sick.

I am going to throw up.

You want to know what
happened? He was terrific!

244

It's always nice to see you.

299
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,290
But I like this place less and less.
It's cold, too.

300
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,900
Warmer, and you complain
about the smell!

301
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,750
How far we've got?

302
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,600
It was the same razor,
the opening examination on...

303
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,200
the girl killed 6 weeks ago!

304
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,550
The blade has 3 jagged nixoning.
You want to see?

305
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,600
No, no!  I believe you.

306
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,350
The other girl had intercourse
less than an hour before she was killed.

307
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,520
There was an
A-negative secretion.

308
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:48,030
Well, it doesn't mean the
killer was the lover!

309
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:49,940
No, but they often are.

310
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:56,850
Golf ball correctable with
Courier 72 at your service.

311
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:57,580
Lovely!

312
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:02,580
- Where shall I put it?
- Over there.  Hello?

313
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,200
- Captain Germani!
- Yeah.

314
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:10,150
Yes, Captain?
Who's been killed?

315
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,850
- Hello, Mr. Bullmer, would you like a drink?
- Thank you very much.

316
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:23,300
Look, you two go right ahead.
I'll take care of it.

317
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:25,550
- Mmm.. You sir?
- Oh, no! No, no,  thank you.

318
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:30,000
CHRISTIANO BERTI: Thank you, Angelica.
Shall we sit down?

319
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,600
Oh, yes, thanks.

320
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,100
CHRISTIANO:
I'd like to do about half
an hour with you...

321
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:37,720
Now?

322
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:41,000
Oh no, in the studio as part
of the early transmission.

323
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,760
I'd like to do
something in depth.

324
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:49,830
- They let me do it about twice a year.
- Okay, fine, sure!

325
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:58,600
Now, "Tenebrae" is about human
perversion and it's effects on society!

326
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
And I'd like to know...

327
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:05,150
how you see the effects of
deviant behaviour on our lives?

328
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:10,000
Well, first of all,
it isn't just about that.

329
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,200
- Two of the victims are deviants.
- No, wait a minute, wait a minute!
- The killer is not--

330
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,150
Wait a minute,
who says they're deviants?

331
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,900
Although one was gay, but so what?

332
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:21,800
I mean his portrait is perfectly happy. 
In fact, his relationship with--

333
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:25,200
The killer's motivation is to eliminate
what he calls corruption.

334
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,650
But the killer is insane!

335
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,000
Well, what I mean by that is that, uh,

336
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:35,700
- that's the only aberrant behavior.
 - Ah!  What is aberrant behavior?

337
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:39,300
I was brought up a very
strict Catholic. Were you?

338
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,510
Yeah! I guess so.

339
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:43,380
But I believe in abortion,
I believe in divorce.

340
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:46,500
That makes me aberrant from
a strictly Catholic standpoint.

341
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,000
I see.

342
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:52,200
I thought this was an
afternoon show!

343
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,300
You really want us to get this heavy?

344
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:57,000
Well, I guess not.

345
00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:00,900
It's just that I'm genuinely
interested myself.

346
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,850
Well, I really appreciate that.
That's a real compliment.  Thank you.

347
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,900
We're starting in 4 minutes,
Christiano.

348
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:13,600
- Ok, mh... shall we?
- Uh-huh.

349
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:16,000
- It's down here!
- Right.

350
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:21,000
Hey, hey. It's my hat!

351
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:32,000
I am going to start the show
with a resume of your work!

352
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:42,830
They're just starting.
No, no, no, that'll 20-30 minutes.
Why don't we--  Why don't we go outside?

353
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,270
Okay. We'll go ahead in 1 minute.

354
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,000
You see, Peter's a very
sensitive guy,

355
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,700
and an interview was a delicate thing.
I didn't want him disturbed.

356
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,110
- Isn't Yves Montand in there?
- Yeah, it's him.

357
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:02,110
Oh, he looks smaller then.

358
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,100
Anyways, is there anything
I can do for you?

359
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:07,860
'Cause Peter got one hell of a schedule,
plus he's starting work on his new book!

360
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:10,760
- Are you a relation?
- I'm his agent!

361
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:14,350
And you get 10% of his conversation
with the police department as well?

362
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:17,800
Heh!  Careful now, I have feelings
just like a real human being.

363
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:21,040
Somehow or other,
your client holds the key!

364
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:25,070
Those Killings are like--
like a tribute to Peter Neal.

365
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:29,700
What'd you do with 10% of a
tribute like that, Mr. Bullmer?

366
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:35,350
You know something.
I read all of those books, "Agatha Christie",

367
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:39,650
"Mickey Spillane", "Drek Staut", "Ek McBain",
and, "I'm a Detective", right?

368
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:43,680
- And you never guess who the murderer is!
- Right, never.

369
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:48,430
You just remember, Mr. Neal.
Any bright ideas, you let me know, okay?

370
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,270
You write about these things,
but I turn over real dead bodies!

371
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:55,130
Good bye, Captain!

372
00:42:57,270 --> 00:43:01,210
- Well, how did it go, okay?
- Yes it's great.
- Looked great to me, too.

373
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:06,250
- I got his autograph!
- Whose?

374
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:09,150
- Yves Montand!
- So what?

375
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:20,860
Could it be somebody I know?

376
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,600
Damn. I wish I'd never
written that book!

377
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,730
You don't mean that!

378
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:42,650
MARIA: Hi!
GIANNI: Hi!

379
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:44,900
Mr. Bullmer left this downstairs for you.

380
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,650
He hoped it would, uh--

381
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,550
Wait, I go down with you!

382
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:55,500
- Is that a proposal?
- If you like!

383
00:43:55,600 --> 00:44:00,100
- Okay, if you need me, I'll be at home!
- Go ahead!

384
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:11,680
Jane? Is that Jane?

385
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:17,210
- Janne McKerrow?
- I could have sworn it was!

386
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:20,960
What's the prefix to
New York?

387
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,330
But, it's impossible,
she is in New York.

388
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:30,260
She never strays 10 miles
from that shrink she goes to.  Here!

389
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,850
[PHONE OUT GOING MESSAGE]:
<i>This is Jane McKerrow.
I am out for the moment.</i>

390
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:39,070
<i>Would you leave your name,
number and message after the tone?</i>

391
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,680
It was Jane!

392
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:43,910
But she'd call you, wouldn't she?
If only to scream at you!

393
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:46,800
She wouldn't even be here
if it wasn't to try to get you back,

394
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,400
- or apologize or something.
- Apologize for what?

395
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,700
For what she did to your--
Oh, God, forget it.

396
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:55,990
My Travel Bag.  You think
it was Jane?  I never said it was.

397
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:57,990
I am going home,
no more buzzes!

398
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:03,250
Hey, Anne, do you think Jane
could have done that?  Huh?

399
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:13,200
MARIA: Bye
- Bye, see you later!

400
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:22,170
No.  I told you I don't give a damn!
You understand?

401
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:26,680
Why don't you say something?

402
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:29,840
Go fuck yourself!

403
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:34,410
Bastard!

404
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:14,500
Help Me. Is anybody home?

405
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:20,650
Hey there!?

406
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:18,350
Is anybody here?
Please! Help me.

407
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:30,470
Isn't anybody here?

408
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,240
Please!

409
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:10,100
Oh, God, please help me.

410
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:12,240
The door was open and I was
attacked by a creep--

411
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:13,540
Spy!

412
00:55:15,850 --> 00:55:19,210
- Oh, my God!
- Damn litte Spy.

413
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,750
No. Leave me alone.

414
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:55,400
What do you want from me?

415
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,250
GEMANI [READING]:
<i>"I grieve for this child.
Her death was the only way...</i>

416
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:55,200
<i>I could be free to go on!</i>

417
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:58,400
<i>I will eliminate those who
disgust me, the human perverts.</i>

418
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:01,650
<i>Soon now, the corruptor himself."</i>

419
00:57:02,790 --> 00:57:04,000
Me.

420
00:57:05,810 --> 00:57:10,530
Be careful, Mr. Neal.
This killer's also very well informed.

421
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:16,000
He knew your hotel in Rome!
He knows you have an agent where
he can send the letter.

422
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:17,850
And he also knows
it could've been dangerous...

423
00:57:17,850 --> 00:57:21,700
coming around to your place
because of the girl, I mean Maria,

424
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:23,170
was living in your building!

425
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,600
Do you need me anymore today,
Captain?

426
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:31,650
No.  No, Mr. Neal.
But...

427
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,850
I'd like you to stay in your
apartment as much as possible,

428
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:39,900
because this last message
threatens you personally.

429
00:57:40,770 --> 00:57:43,800
By the way, I finished your book.
You know what?

430
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:47,700
I guess, too, the killer was on Page 30.
Page 30 never happened before.

431
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,200
I'll take you home.

432
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:52,200
Oh.  I can't do this!
Going through your address book...

433
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,500
trying to pick out crazy people.

434
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:55,850
- It's crazy!
- Why me, why?  Because--

435
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:58,900
Because I have corrupted,
he said!

436
00:57:58,900 --> 00:57:59,900
Or she said!

437
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:03,900
He's right! Trying to
eliminate the human...

438
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:06,650
perverts.

439
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:14,800
Christiano Berti
the TV critic called...

440
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:20,900
"Tenebrae" a novel about
aberrant behaviour and human perversion.

441
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:23,500
He was very weird about it.

442
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:30,200
Hey Gianni, gimme that
telephone book.

443
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:52,900
Christiano Berti lives only
three blocks from here!

444
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:55,300
Now, wait a minute.
This is paranoia!

445
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:58,000
Maria's body was found in the alure.

and it's effect on society."</i>

448
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:11,400
Those were his exact words
before we did the interview.

449
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:18,010
Trying to... eliminate the
human perverts.

450
00:59:18,010 --> 00:59:21,320
Two words, that's hardly a
case against him!

451
00:59:22,230 --> 00:59:24,730
- You could mention it to the captain!
- No.  No way, No way.

452
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:29,000
"Famous crime writer has a dumb idea,"
wouldn't he just love that?

453
00:59:29,430 --> 00:59:32,200
"Peter Neal plays the fool
to raise a killer."

454
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:37,400
On the other hand,

455
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:41,710
if Peter Neal...

456
00:59:41,810 --> 00:59:46,040
got it right,
wouldn't that be something?

457
00:59:54,890 --> 00:59:57,000
- The cops are all over the place.
- Mm-Hm.

458
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:02,400
It's 10:15, they should be
quitting soon!

459
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:05,600
<i>The victim was 17 year old
Maria Alboretto.</i>

460
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:10,400
<i>What happened to her between 2:45
and 7:00 this morning still remains a mystery.</i>

461
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:14,000
<i>Meanwhile, we understand our
murderer sent another letter to the police.</i>

462
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,310
<i>In his message,
he warns he'll be striking again!</i>

463
01:00:17,310 --> 01:00:19,950
<i>He said the next victim will
be someone he refers to...</i>

464
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:22,500
<i>"The Great Corrupter."</i>

465
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:26,090
<i>Well, as a matter of fact,
this message is expected to result in...</i>

466
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:30,300
<i>several businessmen and
politicians leaving the city, then!</i>

467
01:00:54,520 --> 01:01:02,650
Jane?  Jane!

468
01:01:12,870 --> 01:01:17,770
<i>This is Jane McKerrow.
I am out for the moment.
Would you leave your--</i>

469
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:09,100
Come on!

470
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:18,200
I haven't entered someone's garden
since I was about 6.

471
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:19,400
Shut up!

472
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:39,000
This is boring.

473
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:40,800
All detections are boring.

474
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:44,500
But if you cut off the boring bits
and keep the rest...

475
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:46,000
you've got a best seller!

476
01:02:47,850 --> 01:02:50,530
- Jesus.
- He could have been there all the time!

477
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,440
He couldn't have seen us.

478
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:33,500
Listen, I go round the back.

479
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Peter!

480
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:11,000
CHRISTIANO: Who is it?
Who's there?

481
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:23,110
<i>Yes, it was me!
I killed them all.</i>

482
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:59,690
- Peter, Peter!
- Oh, God!  Oh!  Woe!
- Come on, hurry!

483
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:02,560
- Woe!  Oh, my head!
- You'll be okay.

484
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:08,150
We've gotta get out of here.
The guy, the guy, guy has an ax!

485
01:05:11,550 --> 01:05:14,250
He must still be,
be in the house.

486
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,280
We've gotta go, come on!

487
01:05:17,370 --> 01:05:19,200
- What happened to you? 
- I don't know.

488
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:22,000
- Come on!
- I didn't even know.  Somebody must've hit me!

489
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:34,400
What did you see?  The killer?

490
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:36,700
I couldn't see much.
I don't remember!

491
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:38,700
Was he tall, short? What?

492
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:45,500
I don't know.  I didn't see anything,
except--  Except the ax!

493
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:50,250
The Killer... Christiano knew
the killer. Said it was him.

494
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:53,350
He said he was who killed
them all.

495
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:57,580
That many--
Many murders.

496
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,300
The blood!

497
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:08,860
You've got to tell the police.
What you saw could break the case.

498
01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:13,470
I didn't see shit!
A dead man and his head split open.

499
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:16,150
PETER: That's it!
You know what I saw?

500
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:22,600
My mother putting me in a school bus
in Rhode Island.  That's what I saw...

501
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:25,850
after the knock on the head,
like in the movie.

502
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,000
You should have a doctor look at this!

503
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:33,220
I'm okay.  I'm okay!
Just a little dizzy and very dumb!

504
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:36,750
Peter, maybe we should,
maybe we both should go...

505
01:06:36,750 --> 01:06:38,800
back to New York for a while, hm?

506
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:43,200
Anne, would you sleep here tonight?

507
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:45,850
It's just company.
I could make up the bed.

508
01:06:45,850 --> 01:06:50,200
No, no, no, no, you take it easy,
I'll do it. Of course I'll stay!

509
01:07:06,390 --> 01:07:10,730
Six years, and we've never
spent one night together!

510
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:14,500
All for those six years, we had
Jane around to disapprove.

511
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:19,170
- So, how does your head feel?
- My head?

512
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:23,870
How does my head feel?
Well, that is a very interesting question to come.

513
01:07:23,870 --> 01:07:26,840
My head.  My head!

514
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:30,710
What head, hm?

515
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:50,670
Peter, in the morning,
we both forget about this, okay?

516
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:54,100
Nothing's happend.  Nothing!

517
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:57,260
Nothing's happened!

518
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:10,040
Peter?
Peter?

519
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:18,600
Thanks.

520
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:20,400
Would you like some coffee,
Mr. Neal?

521
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:23,260
- We'll close the deal on that basis.  Come in.
- No, thank you.

522
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:30,450
Oh, I am just broken up over Christiano.
I mean it's unbelievable.  Un-believable!

523
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:31,930
Listen, I only came to say that....

524
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,610
Well, I'm thinking of leaving
Rome for a couple of weeks.

525
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:38,700
Maybe going to Paris
or some other place!

526
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:40,850
Peter, Peter, you can't let
me down now.

527
01:09:40,850 --> 01:09:43,000
We are within two days of
making a deal!

528
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:45,450
Please, stay just until Friday!

529
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:47,200
My Life is in danger.

530
01:09:48,790 --> 01:09:51,900
There's no deal in the world
worth risking my life for!

531
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:54,450
You're right!

532
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:57,160
You are right!

533
01:09:58,200 --> 01:09:59,200
You know what we'll do?

534
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:02,300
I'll book a suite for you
at the hotel Florida on the hill.

535
01:10:02,310 --> 01:10:03,800
I'll tell everybody you are going
to New York.

536
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:06,400
Just lay low til the publishers and
the financers come back.

537
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:09,100
I mean, it's a million dollar deal,
you understand?

538
01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:12,200
Just you and me will know
where you are. It's complete safety.

539
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:14,840
Do that for me, will you?

540
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:19,600
What is it?

541
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:21,980
We want Sir Donald Otley on line 1!

542
01:10:22,470 --> 01:10:24,750
- Where is he?
- In London!

543
01:10:24,750 --> 01:10:26,780
Put him on hold!

544
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:31,220
- What do you say?
- I'll call you this afternoon!

545
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:34,520
Attaboy!

546
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:43,190
Donald, how are you?
Hello, hello?

547
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:45,640
Where is that damn drunk?

548
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:48,800
He said he'd call back.

549
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:51,810
No calls!

550
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:39,220
It's okay, Darling!

551
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:44,200
JANE:
I feel so filthy.

552
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,970
Hearing his voice, thinking
he's on the other side of the door,

553
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,900
wondering if he knows about us!

554
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:59,800
No, no, it won't be long,
I promise you!

555
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:05,420
Jane?
Will I see you for lunch today?

556
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:08,320
Yeah. Same place?

557
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:12,130
- Piazza Arduini , 1 o'clock!
- Mm-hm.

558
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:16,400
I can't go in that house.
No way!

559
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:21,390
You don't have to in, Gianni!
Just stay in the car!

560
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:27,600
The lights went out.

561
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:33,000
Somebody switched them off.
Not Christiano.

562
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:35,610
I heard him screaming!

563
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:43,720
Hey?

564
01:12:49,970 --> 01:12:53,130
Stop right here!

565
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:59,700
- I'll walk, you drive and I'll see you later!
- Okay.

566
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:09,450
GERMINI:
I called you over here because...

567
01:13:09,450 --> 01:13:13,120
I didn't want to come to you until
we finished doing a complete checkup.

568
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:15,390
PETER:
Was it the same killer?

569
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:18,230
I think so.

570
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:22,700
Only this time, like with Maria Alboretto,
it was done with an ax!

571
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:25,000
You didn't get the
yellow envelope yet?

572
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,700
- Hm?  No!
- You will!

573
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,340
You said that you only met
With Christiano Berti twice, huh?

574
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:35,950
Yes, at an airport press conference...

575
01:13:35,950 --> 01:13:38,510
and the TV interview.

576
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:42,150
Look here.
Peter Neal,

577
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:45,390
"Analysis of Obsessions."

578
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:50,410
Peter Neal, "Aberrant Behavior" - The Novels.

579
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:55,450
- Peter Neal, "Personal."
- "Personal"?
- Mm-hm.

580
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:02,350
"Born Rhode Island. Prep School
in Yale. Strict Catholic."

581
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:06,140
Here, look.
<i>"Taller than I expected with hazel eyes.</i>

582
01:14:06,140 --> 01:14:08,000
<i>He looked at me often,
but he never spoke to me."</i>

583
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:14,480
Jesus.
 Somebody was really into your life!

584
01:14:15,350 --> 01:14:19,440
- Can we go outside?
- Sure!

585
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:21,150
Bless you!

586
01:14:21,150 --> 01:14:25,460
Oh, thank you.
I have an allergy to dust.

587
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:27,430
What happened to your head?

588
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:30,050
Oh, just beating my brains
out on the case.

589
01:14:30,050 --> 01:14:32,450
- I'm surprised if you have one, too.
- Mm-hm.

590
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:36,750
One thing's for sure.
The killer and Christiano Berti...

591
01:14:36,750 --> 01:14:39,070
were both obsessed
by your work!

592
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:43,450
The last time I asked you, I think
I was just a little sarcastic.

593
01:14:43,450 --> 01:14:45,750
But you know, we need
all the help we can get.

594
01:14:45,750 --> 01:14:50,350
Well, I've made charts and tried building
the plot the same way you have,

595
01:14:50,350 --> 01:14:54,650
tried to figure it out, but
I just have the hunch that...

596
01:14:54,650 --> 01:14:56,390
something is missing.

597
01:14:57,200 --> 01:15:01,700
Tiny piece of a jigsaw.
Somebody who should be dead is alive,

598
01:15:01,700 --> 01:15:05,700
or...
somebody who should be alive...

599
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:07,070
is already dead.

600
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:09,240
Explain that.

601
01:15:09,700 --> 01:15:13,400
You know there is a sentence
in a Conan Doyle's book.

602
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:17,570
<i>"When you have eliminated
the impossible, whatever remains,</i>

603
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:22,220
<i>however improbable,
must be the truth!"</i>

604
01:15:22,220 --> 01:15:24,890
- Mm-hm!
- "The Hound of the Baskervilles"?
- Yes.

605
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:28,200
You know the impossible
in this case is that the...

606
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:31,130
chain of killings doesn't make sense!

607
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:33,000
In "The Hound of the Baskervilles,"

608
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:36,430
the impossible was
the giant ghost mastiff!

609
01:15:36,430 --> 01:15:39,750
The improbable in this case
again, like the book,

610
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:44,010
is almost certainly weird,
unbelievable,

611
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:46,700
but possible.

612
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:52,610
That's what we have to find.
Truth is always possible!

613
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:58,720
- Mr. Neal!
- I have to go.

614
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:01,850
I'm a very devoted reader, Mr. Neal.

615
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:06,860
And I'd like to think that 20 more books
of yours to enjoy in the future!

616
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,460
So I guess
what I'm asking is selfish.

617
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Tell me, would you leave town?
Today?

618
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:14,800
I was going to do just that.

619
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:18,770
Ah, okay, let me know
where to find you, eh?  Good luck!

620
01:16:24,210 --> 01:16:27,880
"For you, Jane."

621
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:41,250
- Passport?
- Passport. Pass--  Oh!
- Okay.

622
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:43,820
The bank's wiring you the
money at Raphael in Paris.

623
01:20:43,820 --> 01:20:46,910
- You are booked for a week.
- Good.

624
01:20:49,990 --> 01:20:51,530
Hello? The Captain.

625
01:20:52,530 --> 01:20:53,530
No!

626
01:20:53,530 --> 01:20:56,000
I am afraid he is up for the
airport already.  Yes?

627
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,700
Is there anything I can--?
Alright!

628
01:21:01,130 --> 01:21:01,870
Good bye!

629
01:21:03,870 --> 01:21:05,500
He just wanted to make sure
you're going.

630
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:06,950
Something happened
he said he was only...

631
01:21:06,950 --> 01:21:09,000
checking to be sure you were safe!

632
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:17,700
- Oh, hi!
 - Hi!

633
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:21,000
I asked Anne to run me to the airport.
You don't have to drive me!

634
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:24,700
Okay.
I was on my way back to the house.

635
01:21:25,790 --> 01:21:27,730
I know there is a piece of
the puzzle there.

636
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:32,800
I can remember it, see it.
Did you decide where are you going?

637
01:21:32,900 --> 01:21:35,800
Classified! Silly, I know.
But if no one knows, then--

638
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:39,710
That's cool.
But I'd be glad to see you again!

639
01:21:40,100 --> 01:21:45,700
I'm sorry Gianni .
I'm really sorry that you had to
get caught up in all of this!

640
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:48,900
I won't say it's worth it,
but I'm glad we've met!

641
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:53,750
And I hope you'd call me when it's over,
and you'll be back in Rome!

642
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:55,150
- I go down with you!
- Okay!

643
01:23:40,430 --> 01:23:45,790
<i>Yes I killed them.
It was me!</i>

644
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,100
<i>I killed them,
I killed them all!</i>

645
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:51,000
Christiano... But I don't...

646
01:23:51,100 --> 01:23:52,900
<i>I Killed them all,
I killed them all...</i>

647
01:23:52,900 --> 01:23:57,930
He was the murderer.
So,

648
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:03,070
who killed him?

649
01:25:27,270 --> 01:25:32,940
- Hello?
- Oh Ann, I'm sorry I wanted Peter!

650
01:25:32,940 --> 01:25:35,970
He's gone, he's left Italy.

651
01:25:35,980 --> 01:25:37,340
I did something, so...

652
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:42,010
It's like there are two
people in me,

653
01:25:42,010 --> 01:25:44,200
and sometimes the other
one just takes over!

654
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:46,280
Where are you, Jane?
Are you in Rome?

655
01:25:46,290 --> 01:25:51,400
Yeah.  Help me please,
don't let me kill myself.

656
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:54,090
Tell me where you are, Jane.
I'll come around, alright.

657
01:25:54,090 --> 01:25:57,700
An appartment, on the
Cassia number 11.

658
01:25:57,700 --> 01:26:00,500
I'll be right round.
Give me a few minutes!

659
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:04,100
I am so sorry!
I didn't mean to.

660
01:26:05,100 --> 01:26:06,800
I wanted to...
explain...

661
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:10,140
about...

662
01:26:11,140 --> 01:26:12,280
everything...

663
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:14,500
I have done!

664
01:26:43,100 --> 01:26:46,200
Okay, I'm coming.
God damn.

665
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:48,600
GERMINI: Who is that lady?

666
01:26:48,700 --> 01:26:51,300
ALTIERI:
She is the housekeeper
of the place Bullmer renting.

667
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:54,590
She's a Philipino and has a lot of
interesting things to say about him.

668
01:26:54,590 --> 01:26:57,490
Like Bullmer had a girlfriend,
a regular girlfriend.

669
01:26:57,490 --> 01:27:01,820
- What languages does she speak?
- Only Tagalog and Spanish!

670
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:06,200
You question her!
The murderer has killed again.

671
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:08,960
I have to go!

672
01:27:12,570 --> 01:27:16,040
Okay, I'll see you later.

673
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:32,950
ALTIERI:
Have you got a license
to work for Mr. Bullmer?

674
01:27:33,790 --> 01:27:36,780
Oh, thank you!

675
01:27:48,940 --> 01:27:52,200
Good bye!

676
01:28:09,330 --> 01:28:10,290
Anne?

677
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:16,290
Is it you, Anne?

678
01:31:00,700 --> 01:31:04,330
Anne?

679
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:16,200
Anne.

680
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:18,930
Anne.

681
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:23,430
Anne.

682
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:31,330
I didn't know... Anne.

683
01:31:31,330 --> 01:31:34,920
I didn't know that was Anne.

684
01:32:12,810 --> 01:32:16,640
No, don't look!

685
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:27,090
When you have eliminated
the impossible,

686
01:32:27,090 --> 01:32:30,060
whatever remains,
however improbable,

687
01:32:30,060 --> 01:32:32,400
must be the truth.

688
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:35,630
And Bullmer's maid told inspector
Altieri he had an affair...

689
01:32:35,630 --> 01:32:37,300
with your fiance.

690
01:32:37,300 --> 01:32:41,300
Altieri was too headstrong
and came over here...

691
01:32:41,300 --> 01:32:43,240
alone to check.

692
01:32:43,240 --> 01:32:46,470
She didn't know that
you Neal are mad.

693
01:32:46,470 --> 01:32:48,240
Completely mad.

694
01:32:48,240 --> 01:32:50,810
And it cost her her life.

695
01:32:50,810 --> 01:32:53,800
I don't know if I should
hate you or feel sorry for you!

696
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:58,400
No, no, no, no, I didn't kill the other women.
I didn't kill the other women.

697
01:32:58,500 --> 01:33:03,280
I know.
That would have been impossible!

698
01:33:06,390 --> 01:33:10,620
But I realized
Christiano Berti was the killer.

699
01:33:11,230 --> 01:33:15,100
And it didn't take me
long to realize that.

700
01:33:17,970 --> 01:33:24,640
The rest, Mr. Germani, was
like writing a book. A Book!

701
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:26,950
Perfect revenge.

702
01:33:26,950 --> 01:33:29,610
The Razor Killer was dead,

703
01:33:29,620 --> 01:33:31,200
but you wanted him to live on,

704
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:34,000
long enough to be blamed
for the murder...

705
01:33:34,300 --> 01:33:39,690
of your fiance and her lover.
The two people you hated most!

706
01:33:39,690 --> 01:33:42,830
- Come on, get up!
- No!

707
01:33:42,830 --> 01:33:45,500
Turn around.
You know the routine.

708
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:50,100
Come on, get up.
Get up!

709
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:56,460
Come on, move over there.

710
01:34:37,100 --> 01:34:40,900
I'll call from the car radio
Come on now, let's go.

711
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:47,920
No wait. I don't--
I don't wanna leave him!

712
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:52,320
- Let's go now!
- Poor Peter.

713
01:35:08,500 --> 01:35:11,810
Okay, it's over!

714
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:18,000
Peter! Peter.
It's not possible.

715
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:21,500
I couldn't believe it either,

716
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:29,000
not until I got the telex
from Interpol this evening.

717
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:32,600
When Peter Neil was a teenager
in Rhode Island,

718
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:36,800
a girl he knew was killed,
brutally!

719
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:44,000
Someone accused Peter,
but there wasn't any real evidence,

720
01:35:44,100 --> 01:35:48,040
and was it never brought to trial!

721
01:35:50,160 --> 01:35:56,230
But it was Peter Neal.
Then he committed an act...

722
01:35:56,700 --> 01:36:00,370
which haunted his life and
twisted his mind forever!

723
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:03,500
It was in his last book.

724
01:36:03,900 --> 01:36:07,240
Now he realized that any
obstacle or humiliation...

725
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:14,700
standing in his way could be
swept aside by a simple act...

726
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:18,850
of annihilation: Murder!

727
01:36:22,700 --> 01:36:25,000
Calm down, it's all over now.

728
01:36:30,660 --> 01:36:33,660
You'd better stay here.
Wait for me, huh?

729
01:39:00,660 --> 01:39:02,660
