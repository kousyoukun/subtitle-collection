1
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,040
The name's Roger Borniche,

2
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,720
Inspector with the Federal Police.

3
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,320
I'm a cop.

4
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,760
I love this goddamn profession.

5
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,480
But this morning, I'd rather
have stayed in bed with Catherine.

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,960
She wants to get married,
make it legal.

7
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,840
But I've got to become
chief investigator first.

8
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,120
I'm already doing the job.

9
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,280
I'm only lacking the title...

10
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,040
and the salary.

11
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,200
I've solved some major cases
since I've been in this joint.

12
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,760
The boss can't deny that.

13
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,320
But that particular morning,

14
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,520
I had no idea what was about to pop up.

15
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,080
Hi, Borniche.

16
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,920
Morning, Roger.

17
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,600
Well?

18
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,880
Well, nothing.

19
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,720
He's talking nonsense.

20
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,440
Leave me alone with him.

21
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,120
If you're so smart...

22
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,560
I'd like to believe you, Raymond.

23
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,960
I always tell the truth.

24
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,600
So the day of the shooting,
the 17 th, you weren't in Paris.

25
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,200
You were in Rouen.

26
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,160
At my brother-in-law's.
He'll confirm it.

27
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,000
They say they saw me in my bar,
but they were outside.

28
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,440
They're obviously wrong.

29
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,760
Or they want you to do wrong.
I don't doubt it.

30
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,320
Then why did your pals beat me up?

31
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,000
They're impulsive.

32
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,840
You too, sometimes.

33
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,720
Not on the 17th,
but on the 16th, 20th or 22nd.

34
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,840
All right.

35
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,880
I'm magnanimous.
I'll release you.

36
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,360
- What for?
- You give Lieutenant Clot information.

37
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,200
Why not let me have it first?

38
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,080
But I'm not an informer!

39
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,240
I could name some of the guys
you've brought down.

40
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,760
Scumbags who worked for the Gestapo.

41
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,320
That's different.

42
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,680
You should've been decorated.

43
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,160
Right. I'll be right there.

44
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,800
Make up your mind.
I'm going to see the boss.

45
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,520
That'll give you some time
to think it over.

46
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,200
- Keep an eye on that guy.
- Sure, Roger.

47
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,760
Come in.

48
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,320
Buisson has escaped.

49
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,120
Buisson?
Never heard of him.

50
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:15,800
You weren't here
when he earned his stripes.

51
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,680
Fine list of holdups.

52
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,160
The Troyees Bank before the war.

53
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,800
In '42, the Victory Street holdup,
a cashier shot.

54
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,240
I want you to get Buisson
before Central does.

55
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,400
We'll show Clot
that the Federal Police exist,

56
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,160
that Central doesn't have
a monopoly on criminal cases.

57
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,320
Careful.
Mr. Emile shoots fast and straight.

58
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,440
Does that appeal to you?

59
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,720
If not, I'd be a salesman.

60
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,280
Go on, get your informers competing.

61
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,840
By the way,
I'd like to release Pelletier.

62
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,440
That's going too far.

63
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,520
The Spaniard was shot
coming out of his bar.

64
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,280
His Rouen alibi will hold.

65
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,920
I think he has a deal with Clot.

66
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,120
How about we cut in?

67
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,520
That's what I like to hear.

68
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,080
- It's up to you.
- I know.

69
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,920
Make Buisson a priority.
Get his file from the archives.

70
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,240
If you pull this off,

71
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,800
I promise you'll make
chief investigator this time.

72
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,960
Say, guys.

73
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,960
The name Buisson
mean anything to you?

74
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,480
The gangster who
broke out of Villejuif?

75
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,120
The chief wants us to get him.

76
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,080
Archives, please.

77
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,680
- What about Raymond?
- We let him go.

78
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,360
Speaking of which,

79
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,440
I don't much like your methods.

80
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,480
Want me to offer him a candy bar?

81
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,320
That's an idea.

82
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,480
Roblin? Borniche here.

83
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,040
Could I have Buisson's file?

84
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,680
Emile Buisson.

85
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,240
Thanks, I'll send Darros.

86
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,400
So, it's a deal.

87
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,440
A deal?

88
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,360
I didn't agree to anything.

89
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,840
If you don't agree,

90
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,920
I'll make sure it gets around
that you inform for Clot.

91
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,720
You must take me for a bitch.

92
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,960
That's why I'm giving you
my phone number.

93
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,160
I'm a pervert.

94
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,160
I love bitches.

95
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,360
Anvers.

96
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,760
My bar, can I open it?

97
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,320
Of course.

98
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,680
If a certain Buisson ever stops by
for a drink, give me a call.

99
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,800
Buisson? Are you crazy?

100
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,000
You know him?

101
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,120
Seen him around,
like lots of others.

102
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,040
Thought he was still in the can.

103
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,440
He got out
on good behaviour.

104
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,760
My brother, Emile.
This is Suzanne.

105
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,920
René's sister.

106
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,840
She was Pete the Saint's girl.

107
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,240
Cops shot him
during the Marseilles holdup.

108
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,720
I know.

109
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,840
We'll stay here for a while.

110
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,080
In any case, I can't go home.
The cops must be there.

111
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,520
They'll check the files.

112
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,440
- The driver?
- Mario the Wop?

113
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,600
He's dumping the car.
Don't worry. He's solid.

114
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,880
When Mario comes back,
have him find another.

115
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,000
Do we need one just yet?

116
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,080
Suzanne, no errands to run?

117
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,240
Bring back the evening paper.

118
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,880
Got a change of clothes?

119
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,240
I want to go dancing this afternoon.

120
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,520
Can't that wait?

121
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,560
I hate to keep squealers waiting.

122
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,880
Cheers.

123
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,840
Hello, baby cop.

124
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,400
Hello, big girl.

125
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,240
A good day?

126
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,680
Hectic.

127
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:40,240
Bernier was out.
I had to answer the phone.

128
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,920
A long wait for the bus.

129
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,880
No waiting on the subway.

130
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,520
Roger, I have the car for Sunday.

131
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,520
The Talbot? Fantastic.

132
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,800
I saw father at noon.
He gave in.

133
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,600
It's hard to resist you.

134
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,120
If you'd been my daughter,
I would've made a very bad father.

135
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,760
What are we doing tonight?

136
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,840
Nothing. I've got to read
these files for tomorrow.

137
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,000
Excuse me.

138
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,560
Devil in the Flesh is playing.

139
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,400
You promised we'd see it.

140
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,640
We'll go next week.
It'll play for a while.

141
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,440
Why don't you change careers?

142
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,800
Your attorney boss needs clients.

143
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,040
This the guy who escaped?

144
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,080
Yes, that's him.

145
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,280
He crazy?

146
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,760
He acts like it 'cause it's easier
to get out of madhouses than prisons.

147
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,600
Is he dangerous?

148
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,200
Very.

149
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,720
Probably because of his
unhappy childhood.

150
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,480
His alcoholic father
made him steal food for them.

151
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,360
That doesn't make for a saint.

152
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,840
He's at the point of no return.

153
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,200
All we can do for him

154
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,320
is keep him from killing
to save his neck.

155
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,760
You should've been an attorney.

156
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,040
Maybe.

157
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,440
Borniche, Federal Police.

158
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,040
- Jean-Baptiste Buisson's file, please.
- Emile's brother?

159
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,040
Everyone wants that one today.

160
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,720
First row.

161
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,640
May I help you, gentlemen?

162
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,360
Hands up.

163
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,960
Everyone up!

164
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,800
Come on, hands up!

165
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,960
Bastards!

166
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,920
Put the dough on the table.

167
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,880
Jewels, lighters, everything.

168
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,680
Quick!

169
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,640
Come on.

170
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,320
Earrings.

171
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,480
The ring.

172
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,680
Now!

173
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,640
Don't move!

174
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,960
The cops.

175
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,240
- You okay?
- Yes, fine. Get moving.

176
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,600
Be careful, they shot at me.

177
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,080
Stop!

178
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,760
Mado, open up.

179
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,920
Is your man here?

180
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,520
- What's the matter?
- We need to stay a minute.

181
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,240
It's stormy outside.

182
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,520
Good to see you, Raymond.

183
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,240
I'll be damned!

184
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,040
I wasn't expecting -

185
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,480
Can I wash up?

186
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,800
Go right ahead.
There's water at the bar.

187
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,880
We'll go to the back room.

188
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,800
You haven't changed in five years.

189
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,400
That's a load.

190
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,880
Grandma's inheritance.
We want top price.

191
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,560
All right.
I'll see the Armenian tomorrow.

192
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,320
You know his terms?

193
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,400
You'll get your cut,
but be quick.

194
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,240
Thursday good?

195
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,240
Deal.

196
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,160
- 4:00.
- Fine.

197
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,240
Mado, bring us a bottle.

198
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,560
"Officer Schmitt Dies
as Result of Injuries."

199
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,640
That's pure Buisson.

200
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,520
Description fits.

201
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,080
That's his style.

202
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,400
The guy escapes,
forms a new team,

203
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,360
and he's back in business.

204
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,360
He doesn't waste any time.

205
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,920
Unlike you.

206
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,800
You're not getting anywhere.

207
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,080
How can I get him in a week?

208
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,680
- The press says you're a super cop.
- I could do without the press.

209
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,600
Listen up.
Just get moving.

210
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,920
Central will spare no effort.

211
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,280
What exactly are you doing?

212
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,880
Aside from smoking
one cigarette after another?

213
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,720
Watching his brother's place.

214
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,600
Central's guys are there already.
Find something else.

215
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,000
I'm looking, Chief.

216
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,000
Phone. Raymond Pelletier.

217
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,600
Will only talk to you.

218
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,480
Inspector?

219
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,240
It's about your friend.

220
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,040
What friend?

221
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,280
The one who's out
on good behaviour.

222
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,440
Oh, I get you. Well?

223
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,040
A man will come to my bar
at 4:00 on Thursday.

224
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,400
Just follow him,

225
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,520
and he'll lead you to the right place.

226
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,040
Fine. Thanks.

227
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,960
There he goes.

228
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,400
Let's go.

229
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,720
We've met.

230
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,560
- Where do you live?
- Paris.

231
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,680
That's where I've seen you.

232
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,840
DÉSIRÉE STREET

233
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,640
May I use the phone?

234
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,520
Give me a coffee.

235
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,240
In Marseilles.

236
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,240
With my uncle.

237
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,200
Hidoine just called.
Join him with the chief.

238
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,920
Here's the address.

239
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,840
I hope he'll confirm that.

240
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,760
If not, we'll have to
have a little talk.

241
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,800
- He's here.
- Where?

242
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,320
You watch Désirée Street,
first on the left.

243
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,240
I followed Jean-Baptiste Buisson here.

244
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,280
He went into the building
at 8, Désirée Street.

245
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,960
I'll stay with Hidoine and Darros.

246
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,480
When we know exactly
where they live, I'll arrest them.

247
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,240
By yourself, Dick Tracy?

248
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,200
The local precinct will help.

249
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,160
Got it.

250
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:14,720
But if you lose Buisson,
I'll send you south after chicken thieves.

251
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,720
I know.

252
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,360
Robert, here's some food.

253
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,600
A beer, the other's for Darros.

254
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,920
Go easy on it.

255
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,000
Get lost!

256
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,040
- Here. Dying of hunger?
- Just about.

257
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,880
Leave a little beer for me.

258
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,320
Now what?

259
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,680
It's too early to move in.

260
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,760
What about those guys?

261
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,520
Do they wait for dawn
to kill everyone?

262
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,640
Goddamn!

263
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,360
Hey, the cops!

264
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,320
Cut the crap.

265
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,720
Get up!

266
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,600
Emile, the cops! Quick!

267
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,480
They tipped us off.

268
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,280
Go upstairs and get out
by the roof. Hurry.

269
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,200
I'll see if it's clear.

270
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,200
Quick, get out!

271
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,480
Stop! Police!

272
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,040
Goddamn!

273
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,360
The ambulance is coming.

274
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,640
- Hello, Germaine.
- Morning, Chief.

275
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,680
Hey, Borniche.

276
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,800
For a former paratrooper,
you're not much of a jumper.

277
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,880
Chief, please.

278
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,960
If you'd pulled it off,
this mess with Central wouldn't matter.

279
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,600
Clot claims he'd laid a trap for Buisson
and that we fouled it up.

280
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,600
- Clot can go and -
- But in the mean time,

281
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,760
we're in it up to our neck.

282
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,880
Chief, we have Buisson's
brother and accomplice.

283
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,560
- What is it?
- Still nothing.

284
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:41,600
We're searching the area
room by room.

285
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,720
That's it.

286
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,560
- See? Still nothing.
- So?

287
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,920
The brother will need
a month in the hospital.

288
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,160
- And the girl?
- She won't talk. She's a real lioness.

289
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,520
I have a meeting
with the director at 2:00.

290
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,520
You know what that means?

291
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:03,160
Give me a detailed report.

292
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,960
Who's calling?

293
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,600
Catherine.

294
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:27,000
I'm fine. Who told you that?

295
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,920
A pack of lies!

296
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,720
Roger, why are you
talking to me like that?

297
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,440
I know. I'm sorry-

298
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,000
Forgive me.

299
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,440
Really, I can't tell you.

300
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,400
I'll try to get free.

301
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,120
I'll do my best.

302
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,120
That's it.

303
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,720
I'll call this evening.

304
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,960
Yes.

305
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,200
Yeah, love you too.

306
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,920
But you don't understand.

307
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,000
Three or four days
while I get him a room.

308
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,840
Thanks.

309
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:34,360
I've found a room in the suburbs.

310
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,040
An old friend.

311
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,600
When you see the Wop,
give him the address.

312
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:41,440
Tell him to bring a Colt.45.

313
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,640
Okay.

314
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:50,320
My God. You've had it, Bollec.

315
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,440
I'll see you guillotined
together with the Buissons.

316
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,960
I'll bust your balls.

317
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,640
You'll never use them again, you swine.

318
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,240
Never again!

319
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:35,040
So that wasn't Emile Buisson with you?

320
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:38,520
It was -
What was his name?

321
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,760
Repeat your bullshit.

322
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,680
Repeat it!

323
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,560
George Muller!

324
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,600
That's the name I knew him by.

325
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,000
I'll make you eat your own shit,
you bastard,

326
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,400
if you go on taking me for a jerk!

327
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,320
You're not in the slammer yet, buddy.

328
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:07,160
He says the guy on the roof
wasn't Buisson.

329
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,240
Interesting.

330
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:16,200
We'll see if your statement
matches your sister's.

331
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,760
Then we'll have a talk.

332
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,240
You got a minute, Lucien?

333
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,520
Now what is it?

334
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,040
You know.

335
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,360
Want me to give gifts
to a guy who kills a cop?

336
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,760
Maybe it wasn't him.

337
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,200
You can do your job without that.

338
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,560
Roger, you're starting
to get on our nerves.

339
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,720
You act important,
but you're not the boss.

340
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,840
Guys like that are vermin.

341
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,320
And vermin are for squashing, get it?

342
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,800
If it had been your brother
or father that got gunned down,

343
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,360
maybe you'd see it differently.

344
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,600
- You think?
- Yes, I'm sure.

345
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,440
Deep down,
you're nothing but an amateur.

346
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,280
Let me tell you a story, Lucien.

347
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,400
A story I never tell.

348
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,240
Suppose I had a brother.

349
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,280
A guy I loved a lot.

350
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,120
In '44, the Lauriston Street
Gestapo got him.

351
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,320
You catch my drift?

352
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,800
They were so "nice" to him
that he died.

353
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,080
Don't mix things up.

354
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,920
I didn't join the force for that.

355
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,200
When I joined up,
I knew I might be killed.

356
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,720
But I knew that being a cop
doesn't put you above the law!

357
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,440
Using certain methods...

358
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:22,120
puts you lower down
than your so-called vermin.

359
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,200
Have you sent
Hollec's P.38 to the lab?

360
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,200
Yes.

361
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,480
- Nothing to tell me?
- I don't talk to cops.

362
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:22,680
- You prefer crooks.
- To each his own.

363
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,640
Crooks don't become a habit.

364
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,800
My guys don't have time
to dirty the sheets.

365
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,600
You'll be accused
of protecting a criminal.

366
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,560
That's rather good.

367
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,480
Buisson is a killer.
He won't hesitate to kill you.

368
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,560
Then it's normal to rat him out?

369
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:04,320
You had guns in your place,
and Buisson, who killed a patrolman.

370
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,280
You'll be charged
along with the rest.

371
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,680
If you like.

372
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:14,200
Believe me, I'm not pleased that
you'll go in for four or five years.

373
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,960
Thanks.

374
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,680
I won't insist.

375
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,680
You don't cooperate,
I'll put you inside.

376
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,680
Not bad, eh?

377
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,320
- Mind if your brother's guillotined?
- He hasn't done anything!

378
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,320
Unfortunately, he has.

379
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,480
And soon you'll have to choose
between Buisson and him.

380
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,960
Well, my colleague
will ask you some questions.

381
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,560
He'll note if you refuse to answer
or refuse to sign.

382
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,800
There it is.

383
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,480
You're in a real mess.

384
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,800
Nobody but me has
the slightest wish to save you.

385
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,080
How kind.

386
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,600
All yours.

387
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,760
Your name is Suzanne Bollec?

388
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,320
Is this gun yours?

389
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,560
You had it when we arrested you.

390
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,880
- You gonna deny that?
- I didn't use it.

391
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:07,240
You couldn't. It was jammed.

392
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,960
Unfortunately for you,
I have the ballistics.

393
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,280
Some bullets from your P.38...

394
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,360
were found in the body
of Alfred Thibon...

395
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:27,040
Freddy the Accordionist.

396
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,720
Mean anything to you?

397
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,480
He got taken out
on September 3,

398
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,440
the same day Emile Buisson escaped.

399
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,720
You don't waste time.

400
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,200
I had nothing to do with it.

401
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,040
But that's nothing.

402
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:58,080
Can't expect crooks to settle scores
with a kid's game.

403
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,520
But your little gun
also killed Officer Schmitt,

404
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,520
highway patrolman
and father of three.

405
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,120
Photo enlargement leaves no doubt.

406
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,880
Look at your gun.

407
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,480
It's gonna cost you, René.

408
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,200
It's not mine!

409
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,480
No need to shout.

410
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,280
I showed it to your sister.

411
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,440
She recognized it.

412
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,760
I doubt it.
She doesn't know a thing about guns.

413
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,280
Then tell me why
you had it on you.

414
00:43:56,320 --> 00:44:00,760
When I was clearing out,
I took the first I found.

415
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,280
But it's not mine.

416
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,360
Then it's Emile Buisson's.

417
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,440
He wasn't with us.

418
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,080
Oh, yeah. That's right.

419
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,160
It was -
What's his name?

420
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,360
That's right, Muller.

421
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,680
So it's Muller's gun.

422
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,160
You expect me to believe that?

423
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,920
I hope you like escargot.

424
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,440
They're very good.

425
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:40,600
A police officer brings them
from the countryside.

426
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,960
It's Sunday tomorrow.

427
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,280
Shall I wake you for church,

428
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,800
Mr. Chabert?

429
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:56,400
I guess you don't like priests too much.

430
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,480
You were lucky.

431
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,120
Glad to see you.

432
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,880
Bring the supplies?

433
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,040
Get me a grenade.

434
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:00,040
A fragmentation grenade
from the army.

435
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,600
What the heck
you gonna do with that?

436
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:06,000
Blow up the first cop
that comes my way.

437
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,800
- I went to the Armenian.
- And?

438
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,240
Disappeared two days ago
with the stuff.

439
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:28,800
What you make of that?

440
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,440
The doctor said
not to take too long.

441
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,000
Number four.

442
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,080
I thought I smelled a pig.

443
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,240
Have a seat.

444
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:18,240
Good of you to come.

445
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:21,520
I get bored, miss my friends.

446
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,840
What's your name?

447
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,680
You've got the roles backwards,
Jean-Baptiste.

448
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,920
Why should cops
always ask the questions?

449
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:34,600
You the famous Borniche?

450
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:41,080
I hear you eat grilled gangster
for breakfast.

451
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,400
About the Arbois Inn
and Officer Schmitt.

452
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,120
There's little time. You're tired.

453
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,680
I'm fine. Stay as long as you like.

454
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:54,760
Bollec has confessed. This is routine.

455
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,520
Got a smoke?

456
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,920
I'll have one later
while thinking of you.

457
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,800
Thanks, kid.
Got a light?

458
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:35,520
The name of your guy?

459
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:38,840
René Bollec.

460
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:42,280
Never heard of him.

461
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:44,840
Ever hear of your brother?

462
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:49,200
I read he'd escaped.

463
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:53,240
I'll tell you his problem.
He was in bad company.

464
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:56,640
Otherwise, he never would've
hurt anyone, not even a cop.

465
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:00,040
I'm sure of it.

466
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:04,120
September 3, I was in Dijon.
My sister will confirm it.

467
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,920
Hope you have
another alibi for the court.

468
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,840
Borniche,
I don't want to waste your time.

469
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,080
I'm 52.
I'm not about to fall into your traps.

470
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,200
I know nothing.

471
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:20,320
I lost my memory in 1937.

472
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:21,880
Exactly 10 years ago.

473
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,960
Covered by the statute of limitations.

474
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:28,360
If you get that,
you got it all.

475
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:30,720
Leaving already?

476
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:33,680
I got it all.
No need for a statement.

477
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,680
- Here. It's the real stuff.
- Thanks, cop.

478
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,320
Deep down, you're not a bad guy.
Come back to see me.

479
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:47,640
I'll tell you all about Indochina.
It might teach you something.

480
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,120
I'll leave the teaching
To Judge Boissenade.

481
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,360
You'll see.
He's a very serious guy.

482
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:57,360
That's all we need, the justice system
in the hands of clowns.

483
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:02,960
Bye, Borniche.

484
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:08,000
If you see Emile,
say hello for me.

485
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,000
If you have time.

486
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,200
Hands on the bar, Raymond.

487
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,240
What's the matter, Emile?

488
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,160
Where are the jewels?

489
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:50,320
The Armenian, he's checking them.

490
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,320
I told your brother.

491
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:54,360
You know where he is?

492
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,200
Must have heard it on the radio.

493
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,040
I just came down.

494
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,280
I went to bed late.

495
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,320
You bastard!

496
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,120
Borniche, Federal Police.

497
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:41,680
Raymond Pelletier, the owner.
Shot behind his bar.

498
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:55,880
Buisson?

499
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,160
I was upstairs. I saw nothing.

500
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:03,080
I came down when I heard the shots.

501
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:06,680
Did he come here?

502
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,000
Did he come to see Raymond last week?

503
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,520
Raymond was straight.

504
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:18,120
It's disgusting to kill him like that.

505
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:27,160
Buisson's crazy.
You don't have to protect him.

506
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,080
Who was with him?

507
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,000
Leave me alone.

508
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,400
Isn't this enough?

509
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,560
Who did he come with last week?

510
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,920
His brother and...

511
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:45,640
And?

512
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:50,600
Mario.

513
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,200
A wop.

514
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:57,720
He has a woman.

515
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:01,040
She's a hooker near St. Denis.

516
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:03,040
Know her name?

517
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:06,560
Jenny.

518
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,560
Is that all you can tell me?

519
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,280
Isn't that enough?

520
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,400
She's blond, Polish.

521
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:27,560
Thanks, Mado.

522
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,920
The Polack's in a meeting.
Choose another one.

523
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:43,640
She just went up, I'll call.

524
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:45,880
I don't want her.

525
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,280
I want the Wop.

526
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,480
What? The Wop?

527
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,320
I'm in a hurry.

528
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,840
Perhaps you don't know Mario the Wop.

529
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,760
I do, but I never see him.

530
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,840
Do your best to see him.

531
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:17,160
If not, I'll have this rotten joint busted

532
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:22,040
I've got reasons enough
to put you in the slammer.

533
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,840
Like the plan?

534
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,160
He never comes here, I swear.

535
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:35,640
He works in the Étoile area.

536
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:40,680
You can call him at the Calanques Bar.

537
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,000
I knew you wanted
to help your country.

538
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:49,600
If he's really done something wrong,

539
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,760
it's only natural I should help a bit.

540
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:53,320
It's only natural.

541
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,120
There.

542
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:00,240
- Evening.
- Number four.

543
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,200
Don't forget the tip, baby.

544
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:10,320
Go on.

545
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:48,240
Help! Robbery!

546
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:54,120
What's gotten into you?
You crazy?

547
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,000
Call me at the Calanques.

548
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:18,680
I'll call you at the Calanques.

549
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:47,120
I came to make your bed.

550
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:52,160
I didn't ask you to.

551
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:57,200
- What are you looking for?
- Nothing. Now I know who you are.

552
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:02,920
I just want to help.

553
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:10,440
Get out of here
and don't come back.

554
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,560
Wait at the end of the street.

555
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:35,560
- Don't be long.
- Ten minutes.

556
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:38,960
- Let's not miss the beginning.
- You'll see the movie.

557
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:05,760
Evening, Ange.

558
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:16,280
Evening, Inspector.

559
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,640
Give me a martini.

560
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:26,040
- What's wrong, Ange?
- Nothing, I'm fine.

561
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:27,760
You don't look it.

562
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:31,200
A little nauseous.
I must've eaten something bad.

563
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,160
Take care of your health, Ange.

564
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:38,320
We'd hate to lose you.

565
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:50,640
Know him?

566
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:54,800
An Italian.

567
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:57,400
I'm told he comes here.

568
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:01,560
You were told wrong, Inspector.

569
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:08,240
Evil gossip.

570
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:10,480
The Italian do anything wrong?

571
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:14,360
Think about it. When we want someone,
it's for his own good.

572
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:15,800
That's true.

573
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,280
No, you'll offend me.

574
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:23,800
Then I'll offend you.

575
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,440
See you soon, Ange.

576
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:31,440
Night.

577
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:54,640
You know who just left?

578
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:56,920
A cop.

579
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:59,760
Not just any cop,
Inspector Borniche.

580
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,280
What did he want?

581
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:07,280
To know if Mario came here.

582
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:09,760
That's interesting.

583
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:16,760
Damn.

584
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,200
I was scared.

585
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:22,160
You should've told me.

586
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:25,000
I would have shot your buddy.

587
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:38,440
Bullets from the same Colt 45.

588
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:41,480
Well?

589
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,480
The same gun killed Pelletier
and the bank collector.

590
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,040
Buisson again.

591
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,440
They want you to listen to the tapes.

592
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:54,880
I had the phone
in the Calanques Bar tapped.

593
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,680
A friend of Buisson's receives calls there.
You never know.

594
01:00:58,240 --> 01:00:59,840
Thanks, Mr. Legal.

595
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:10,960
What weather.

596
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:12,880
All we need is snow.

597
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:18,520
Got another recording.

598
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:20,240
Somebody called for Mario.

599
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:23,560
It must be Buisson.

600
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,680
Don't come. I've moved.

601
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:28,440
What time tomorrow?

602
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:31,080
5:00 in Vincennes Forest,
Champigny Highway.

603
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:33,280
Where exactly?

604
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:35,280
The Fourchette,
behind the yellow cabin.

605
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:38,240
- What car?
- A black Simca 1000.

606
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:39,680
Bye, Mario. See you tomorrow.

607
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,480
Roger, he's leaving.

608
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:58,960
Let him go.

609
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:01,080
We'll get him at the Calanques.

610
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,720
If he sees he's followed, it's over.

611
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:06,240
I'll never get it.

612
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:08,040
Bust our ass to catch guys,

613
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,640
and once we get them,
we let them go.

614
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:23,120
I waited over an hour.

615
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:26,800
It's odd he didn't show up.

616
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:31,080
He changes his mind sometimes.

617
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:35,000
Put yourself in his shoes.
On the run, you get wary.

618
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:39,640
We should visit the factory
in St. Denis.

619
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:44,800
There's no time to loose.
Payday is Tuesday.

620
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,520
Yes, it's urgent.

621
01:03:57,120 --> 01:03:57,920
Gentlemen.

622
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:20,280
Hello.

623
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:25,040
Jeannot, the friend I told you about
for the next job.

624
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:36,480
I don't get it, Emile.

625
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:38,360
About the meeting?

626
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:41,320
I'll explain later.

627
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:43,960
- Miss.
- Coming.

628
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:47,120
My treat.

629
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:50,320
Looks like the food's good here.

630
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:51,880
Very good.

631
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:54,840
I didn't expect to see you here.

632
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:56,440
You know...

633
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:00,160
no one ever expects to see me.

634
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:02,600
Sometimes I just show up.

635
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:14,120
What does that mean, Emile?

636
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:18,200
Nothing.

637
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:20,800
I'm having a laugh.

638
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:23,480
I like to have a laugh
now and then.

639
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:28,000
Paulo said you ate here often,
so we stopped by just in case.

640
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:31,160
I'll take a pâté to start.

641
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:34,560
Me too.

642
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:49,440
Good night, gentlemen.

643
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:56,840
Come to my place for a drink?

644
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:58,800
Where's that?

645
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:02,000
Ville d'Avray. I've got a little place
on the road to Versailles.

646
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:05,880
I've got a date with a girl
when she gets off work.

647
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,480
She can wait.

648
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:09,680
It's good for chicks.

649
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:14,240
You can't refuse a drink.

650
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,440
Must be the ignition.

651
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:50,160
I'll take a leak.

652
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,760
Not a bad idea.

653
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:15,440
Now, Wop!

654
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:19,120
What are you doing, Emile?

655
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:22,760
Born in the Year of the Rat,
weren't you?

656
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:26,280
You crazy?

657
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,600
You asshole.

658
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:32,440
You keep out of this.

659
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:41,640
Paulo.

660
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:45,640
The Wop was an informer.

661
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:50,320
I didn't have time to warn you.

662
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:54,520
The cops were waiting
at the meeting spot today.

663
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:01,760
He won't be chatting
with them anymore.

664
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:51,240
Let's clear out.
Quick.

665
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:09,800
Hurry up!

666
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:14,320
Quick!

667
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:31,920
The bastard.

668
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:38,440
"Worker, Former Resistance Member,
Victim of Killer Buisson.

669
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:42,720
Our friend Guégan
gave his life for Capital.

670
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:46,600
While Mr. Jules Moch's police
are beating up miners in the north,

671
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:51,120
Emile Buisson is still on the loose,
shamelessly killing innocent workers.

672
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:54,360
What are the geniuses
at the Federal Police up to?

673
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:57,800
Where are these cops,

674
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:01,400
called 'supermen' by certain
members of the press corps."

675
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,280
That's for Borniche.

676
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:08,320
They attack Moch, he'll attack us.

677
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:10,920
Not to mention the unions.

678
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Right now, it's a big joke.

679
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:15,840
- Where's Borniche?
- It's his day off.

680
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:18,120
I'll give him a goddamn day off!

681
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:21,400
Along with the whole bunch of you!

682
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,360
The Buisson case is closed!

683
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:25,600
I'm taking you off it.

684
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:30,840
Get me Borniche at home.

685
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:33,000
Yeah, hurry up.

686
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:41,680
Good morning.

687
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:43,560
Yes, he's here.
I'll get him.

688
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:56,000
It's for you.

689
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:58,240
- Who is it?
- The boss.

690
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:05,280
Morning, Chief.

691
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:08,640
I can't answer so fast.

692
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:10,720
You know I've done everything I could.

693
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:18,440
Okay.

694
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:22,440
As you like.

695
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:27,120
I'm more likely to get him
than Degreffe.

696
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:33,280
See you tomorrow, sir.

697
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:16,320
What was that about?

698
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:20,040
I'm off the Buisson case.

699
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:22,600
He woke you to say that?
He's insane.

700
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:25,560
He's a civil servant.

701
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:27,120
He's afraid of his superiors.

702
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:29,880
You can't let yourself
be abused like that.

703
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:42,000
Some days.

704
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:46,520
Some days what?

705
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:50,840
I'd like to be Emile Buisson.

706
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:56,440
For God's sake!

707
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:00,240
10,000 bread tickets,

708
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:02,960
as many gasoline tickets,
and you deny it?

709
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:07,040
What, the devil goes to work
in your print shop at night?

710
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:10,640
You should check my employees.

711
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:27,920
Nice work.

712
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:30,560
Come on.

713
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:32,920
Be reasonable.

714
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:36,000
If not,
we might get mad.

715
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:38,320
Come with me.

716
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:40,880
A corpse near Versailles.

717
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,880
The chief chose us.

718
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:45,960
How kind.

719
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:48,800
I'll leave you with him.

720
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:57,480
I advise you not to waste our time.

721
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:03,920
Didn't find much.
A settling of scores.

722
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:05,680
Let's see the face.

723
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:14,800
Come look.

724
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:17,360
Looks like the Wop.

725
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:19,520
Mario?

726
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:24,600
I'm sure of it.

727
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:26,600
I'll be damned.

728
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:29,960
How's that for luck?

729
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:31,520
You know him?

730
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:34,680
Probably know who killed him too.

731
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,640
That's great!

732
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:46,560
Now you interfere in our work!

733
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:48,120
Turn it down a notch.

734
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:51,440
What do you want?
Got a warrant?

735
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:53,160
Warrant or not,
you're coming with us.

736
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:55,920
I am not!
I wasn't soliciting!

737
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:57,800
That guy your fiancé?

738
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:01,280
We're just looking for
Mario's murderer. That's all.

739
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:04,280
I don't give a damn about him!

740
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:07,440
I got nothing to do with him.
If he croaked, that's too bad.

741
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:09,800
I left him more than a year ago.

742
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:12,600
Want me to give him
a first class funeral?

743
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:14,680
Maybe you know his friends.

744
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:17,000
I know nothing!
And I've got nothing to say!

745
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:19,720
All I got to give is my ass!

746
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:22,000
That good enough for you?

747
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:25,200
Whatever you say, Jenny.
We might take you up on that.

748
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:28,520
That's it!
The pigs will send me a ham.

749
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:30,080
For Christmas.

750
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:39,360
What you laughing at, jerk?

751
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:43,240
Come to think of it,

752
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:46,320
you knew him too,

753
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:48,520
Mario the Wop?

754
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:50,800
No, not well.

755
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:52,960
His friends?

756
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:54,760
I never saw his friends.

757
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:58,560
You never saw anyone in the bar?

758
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:00,600
No, I swear, Inspector.

759
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:08,720
Just warming up.

760
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:11,120
- My glasses.
- Don't need to see.

761
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:13,280
Just need to talk.

762
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:15,960
You skunk.

763
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:17,720
Well?

764
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:21,760
Who did Mario see?

765
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:25,920
If you got nothing to say,
we'll get you for running a whorehouse.

766
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:27,960
Your deal with the Vice Squad
won't help!

767
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:30,040
I don't know.

768
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:32,160
Sometimes he came with Paulo.

769
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:33,560
Paulo?

770
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:34,800
Paulo what?

771
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:38,400
The bomber, his wife is sick.

772
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:40,160
Syphilis?

773
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:44,600
No, TB. She's in a home.

774
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:47,760
Where does he live?

775
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:49,720
I don't know.

776
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:53,000
It's probably in our files.

777
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:58,520
Come on.

778
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:07,080
Alias Paulo the Bomber.

779
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:10,680
Listed in the special file,
"The Fight Against Gangsters."

780
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:15,520
Paul Roubier, alias Paulo the Bomber.
Born March 29, 1904.

781
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:20,800
This might be a good lead.

782
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:25,120
- Well?
- Look.

783
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:27,680
With Buisson in '42
at the Victories Street holdup.

784
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:30,080
They got off for lack of proof.

785
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:31,800
Victories or Victory Street?

786
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:33,360
Victories.

787
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:35,720
I'll send out a wanted notice.

788
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:38,840
No, just find his wife.

789
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:41,080
What?

790
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:00,440
Don't be sad.

791
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:03,600
See you next week.

792
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:42,400
- Give me a ride to Paris, Roubier?
- What do you want?

793
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:44,640
We're not in the same club,
but we can still have a chat.

794
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:50,720
The Pacra factory is offering a million
to anyone helping to arrest the killer.

795
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:53,640
The killer is Emile Buisson.

796
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:58,560
You've worked for less.

797
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:01,640
Get that crooked head thinking.

798
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,680
What you're doing is disgusting.

799
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:12,840
If you refuse,
it'll get even more disgusting.

800
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:17,000
You need streptomycin
to save your wife.

801
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:20,680
I promise I'll get it from the States.

802
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:27,000
You gonna hesitate between
a killer like Buisson and your wife?

803
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:33,680
Another thing.

804
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:37,920
I know you were a friend of
Mario the Wop.

805
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:42,400
Emile killed him for nothing.

806
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:47,560
The Wop wasn't an informer.

807
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:50,200
Mr. Emile got that one wrong.

808
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:53,200
We'll spread the word around.

809
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:04,680
But in case you don't cooperate,

810
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:07,120
I'm sure you were
in the latest holdups.

811
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:10,320
And I'll prove it.

812
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:14,240
I'll send you up
for 15 to 20 years.

813
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:17,240
You'll never see your wife again.

814
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:30,640
I hate myself.

815
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:40,320
Me too.

816
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:43,120
But we have no choice,

817
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:46,680
either one of us.

818
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:10,800
Hi.

819
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:17,400
A tip, the Versailles tax office.

820
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:19,120
There's a pile.

821
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:21,800
- How much?
- 12 to 15 grand.

822
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:24,480
The hideout?

823
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:27,360
I found something
in the countryside, a hotel.

824
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:28,960
I know the owner.

825
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:33,240
Gotta find me a piece.

826
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:35,920
Mine's hot.
It's gotta go down the drain.

827
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:37,920
I'll find you one.

828
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:39,640
A P.38, if possible.

829
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:43,720
I always liked them.

830
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:50,880
What? A gun for Buisson?

831
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:53,040
Are you mad, Borniche?

832
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:57,960
Do you realize what you're asking for?

833
01:22:58,080 --> 01:22:59,720
A P.38,

834
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:01,480
if possible.

835
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:04,560
A P.38?

836
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:08,120
He prefers them.

837
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:16,280
What if we give him a Colt?
Will he throw a tantrum?

838
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:22,480
You know what his temper is like.

839
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:24,240
Listen, Borniche.

840
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:26,880
This time you've crossed the line!

841
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:30,440
You put yourself back
in charge of the Buisson case.

842
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:33,120
You invented a ridiculous story!

843
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:35,440
Excuse me, Chief.

844
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:38,000
You told me to investigate
a corpse in the Ville d'Avray.

845
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:40,640
Am I to blame
if it brought me back to Buisson?

846
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:44,480
- You kept it to yourself.
- I wanted to be sure.

847
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:46,440
That suited you.

848
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:47,480
So,

849
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:52,880
now we give Mr. Buisson
a vacation in a country hotel.

850
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:57,640
And on top of that, you want
to give him a gun to shoot us with?

851
01:23:58,440 --> 01:23:59,680
Really.

852
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:05,320
It's become a huge joke.

853
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:08,200
I'll get Buisson a P.38.

854
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:11,240
Where, Inspector?

855
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:13,480
A souvenir of French commandos.

856
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:17,400
If anything happens,
I'll have you locked up.

857
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:19,720
Do you hear me?

858
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:22,280
Very well, sir.

859
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:24,160
My regards.

860
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:54,440
Here.

861
01:25:57,800 --> 01:25:59,400
It wasn't easy.

862
01:26:07,480 --> 01:26:09,360
Just kidding.

863
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:13,800
Your tax man?

864
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:18,280
Jeannot is working on it.

865
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:24,040
Tell him to hurry it up.
I'm bored to hell here.

866
01:26:24,160 --> 01:26:25,960
It's time I left France.

867
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:28,640
Bring a paper?

868
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,480
Damn.

869
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:43,680
If the government
would get off my back,

870
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:46,600
I'd give the jerks more
than a strike to worry about.

871
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:18,760
- Is the chief out?
- Still in Lyon.

872
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:21,920
He'll be back at noon.

873
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,920
We'll have to go on without him.

874
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,440
Impossible, he'll be mad.

875
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:28,240
So he'll be mad.

876
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:30,640
- It's now or never.
- Just a minute.

877
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:33,360
- Did you warn the local precinct?
- No. If Buisson suspects anything,

878
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:35,680
we won't get him alive.

879
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:38,800
Moreover, Roubier says
he always carries a grenade

880
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:40,720
to blow himself up if necessary.

881
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:43,760
You're insane. We're taking a huge risk,
and we're not even covered.

882
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:47,640
It's a rule to warn the precinct
and the chief.

883
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:50,200
Aren't we in the service?

884
01:27:51,240 --> 01:27:53,360
I'm not forcing you to come.

885
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:07,600
- Alfonse.
- Inspector?

886
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:10,440
- Put that on the chief's desk.
- Right away.

887
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:16,240
- Asked for a car?
- A special one is waiting.

888
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:01,760
You all right?

889
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:22,600
Fill her up, please.

890
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:25,760
Roger, the other side.

891
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:21,400
- Can we eat here?
- Yes, sir. We have a restaurant.

892
01:30:21,480 --> 01:30:22,800
Great!

893
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:25,800
We'll lunch here.

894
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:28,160
We can be at the clinic at 4:00.

895
01:30:32,720 --> 01:30:34,880
- May I park here?
- Of course, sir.

896
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:35,600
"Lunching with Buisson at the hotel.

897
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:40,840
Come for coffee.
Respectfully, Borniche."

898
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:43,040
Good God!

899
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:10,800
What's he doing?

900
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:12,960
Looking at the car.

901
01:32:13,080 --> 01:32:15,880
He can take it.
I have a plug.

902
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:20,320
You all right?

903
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:22,520
Going crazy, but I'm fine.

904
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:30,040
The table is ready.

905
01:32:32,680 --> 01:32:34,840
- Take your pick.
- Over there.

906
01:32:37,160 --> 01:32:38,640
Here are the menus.

907
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:41,120
I recommend the chicken, a specialty.

908
01:32:41,240 --> 01:32:43,680
The chicken will be great.
Bring hors d'oeuvres first.

909
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:46,680
- For me too.
- No, thanks.

910
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:49,720
I'll bring the hors d'oeuvres
and a bottle of the local wine.

911
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:51,320
Yeah, thanks.

912
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,600
"Music soothes the savage beast."

913
01:34:07,640 --> 01:34:08,680
You play well.

914
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,560
Little things, not Chopin.

915
01:34:14,760 --> 01:34:16,520
I like things like that better.

916
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:20,400
Know any other Edith Piaf?

917
01:34:49,200 --> 01:34:50,640
Here you are.

918
01:34:52,200 --> 01:34:54,000
Have you decided, sir?

919
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:56,160
Chicken.

920
01:34:57,680 --> 01:35:00,160
Come and eat, Catherine.
We're late.

921
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:05,920
Thank you, miss.

922
01:35:11,680 --> 01:35:13,160
Excuse us, sir.

923
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:27,120
You're not giving him a concert.

924
01:35:28,840 --> 01:35:30,640
He's got nice eyes.

925
01:35:33,680 --> 01:35:36,880
He's about to move in, Roger.

926
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:38,600
Go ahead, laugh.

927
01:35:38,720 --> 01:35:40,520
May I eat, ma'am?

928
01:35:44,520 --> 01:35:47,120
- He's coming back.
- Eat and don't turn around.

929
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:58,440
I think Le Caporal Epinglé
should have won the Goncourt.

930
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:00,600
Read it?

931
01:36:03,120 --> 01:36:04,880
Not much time to read

932
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:07,560
with all these strikes.

933
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:10,800
Literary awards
are fixed by publishers.

934
01:36:10,920 --> 01:36:12,320
How about some wine?

935
01:36:19,320 --> 01:36:21,240
Excuse me, I forgot.

936
01:36:31,960 --> 01:36:33,440
Excuse me.

937
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:41,960
Better call the clinic.

938
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:44,840
Yes, perhaps.

939
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:50,920
- Can we call Rambouillet?
- Of course. What number?

940
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,840
- 432.
- 432 Rambouillet.

941
01:37:13,480 --> 01:37:16,320
Hello, miss.
Mother Goose Inn here.

942
01:37:16,440 --> 01:37:19,240
Rambouillet 432, please.

943
01:37:25,960 --> 01:37:27,960
Hope you enjoy it.

944
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:33,840
Really?

945
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:36,120
Hold on a minute.

946
01:37:36,240 --> 01:37:38,320
That number doesn't exist.

947
01:37:42,600 --> 01:37:43,800
What?

948
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:49,680
It's the Ambroise Paré Clinic.

949
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:51,080
Wait.

950
01:37:51,160 --> 01:37:53,400
Is this the Ambroise Paré Clinic?

951
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:56,240
- She make a mistake?
- Ambroise Paré?

952
01:37:56,960 --> 01:37:58,560
Mrs. Mercier?

953
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:01,400
Dr. Le Garrec here.

954
01:38:04,600 --> 01:38:06,600
We're a little late.

955
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:10,640
Tell the boss I'll be there at 4:00.

956
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:14,320
We're on our way.

957
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:16,480
Yes.

958
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:19,160
Fine, Mrs. Mercier.

959
01:38:19,720 --> 01:38:21,160
See you later.

960
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:30,960
- How's the chicken coming?
- It's coming up.

961
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:33,160
Taste it.
It's her specialty.

962
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:35,920
- Some bread, please.
- Oh, yeah. Coming.

963
01:38:40,120 --> 01:38:42,040
Excuse me, my wife forgot.

964
01:38:42,160 --> 01:38:43,960
- Everything all right?
- Great.

965
01:38:55,120 --> 01:38:56,720
It's over, Emile!

966
01:38:58,720 --> 01:39:00,000
The grenade! Good God!

967
01:39:51,480 --> 01:39:54,280
What followed is routine police work.

968
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:56,880
Buisson imprisoned in the Santé.

969
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:00,960
I questioned him before
a special commission.

970
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:05,120
Twice a week,
I picked him up in a station car,

971
01:40:05,240 --> 01:40:07,520
early in the morning.

972
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:11,800
- Morning, Mr. Borniche.
- Hi, Emile.

973
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:15,200
Little by little,
certainly not on purpose,

974
01:40:15,320 --> 01:40:18,360
something strange
happened between us.

975
01:40:18,920 --> 01:40:23,040
Friendship would be a big word,
but we became pals.

976
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:25,560
We nearly understood one another,

977
01:40:25,640 --> 01:40:28,280
especially when talking
about the weather.

978
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,480
- Come back for him at 6:00.
- Very well.

979
01:41:46,760 --> 01:41:49,080
So Emile would sit down.

980
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:52,680
With his free hand,
he'd pour himself a glass of Bordeaux.

981
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:55,680
I bought him a bottle of it.

982
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:08,840
He'd take out his thick glasses
and read the Figaro on the table.

983
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:24,280
It was 11:00.

984
01:42:24,360 --> 01:42:26,680
I wouldn't question him till 12:30.

985
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:32,000
I'd go over the reports.
A moment of peace.

986
01:42:32,640 --> 01:42:35,120
Emile, just the news.

987
01:42:42,520 --> 01:42:45,480
Why do you always
read the Figaro?

988
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:47,240
Habit.

989
01:42:47,800 --> 01:42:51,240
On the run, no one suspects a guy
reading the Figaro. It's too serious.

990
01:42:51,320 --> 01:42:54,280
At 2:00, serious work begins.

991
01:42:54,640 --> 01:42:58,840
The stack of files on Mr. Emile
were almost five feet high.

992
01:42:59,560 --> 01:43:02,120
He was charged with
36 murders and holdups.

993
01:43:02,200 --> 01:43:03,680
They threw the book at him.

994
01:43:03,800 --> 01:43:07,400
But I had to go through all of it
to separate truth from falsehood.

995
01:43:08,120 --> 01:43:11,040
Emile confessed to everything
except for the killings.

996
01:43:11,120 --> 01:43:13,680
But I had condemning evidence,

997
01:43:13,800 --> 01:43:15,440
unshakable witnesses,

998
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:19,520
and the P.38 business
weighed heavily against him.

999
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:28,680
Shall we start?

1000
01:43:30,200 --> 01:43:32,000
Let's start, Mr. Borniche.

1001
01:43:36,680 --> 01:43:38,800
Our meetings went on for over a year.

1002
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:43,000
Only once did the real Buisson show.

1003
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:47,800
The day we talked about Paul Roubier,
Paulo the Bomber.

1004
01:43:56,200 --> 01:43:58,200
That guy, Mr. Borniche,

1005
01:44:00,160 --> 01:44:02,800
I'd like to take a handsaw
to his throat...

1006
01:44:06,160 --> 01:44:08,680
and stop from time to time
to hear him scream.

1007
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:20,800
I'm afraid you won't get the chance.

1008
01:44:22,240 --> 01:44:23,200
Yeah.

1009
01:44:33,320 --> 01:44:35,040
Too bad.

1010
01:44:42,200 --> 01:44:46,640
I sat in silence watching Buisson,

1011
01:44:46,760 --> 01:44:48,240
motionless in his chair,

1012
01:44:48,360 --> 01:44:50,440
his right arm hanging in the cuffs.

1013
01:44:52,840 --> 01:44:57,280
I thought to myself,
"Emile has guts."

1014
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:22,360
Condemned to death
by the Seine High Court,

1015
01:45:22,480 --> 01:45:25,960
Emile Buisson was executed
on February 28, 1956.

1016
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:30,480
