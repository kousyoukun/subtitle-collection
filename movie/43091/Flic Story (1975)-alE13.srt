1
00:00:38,247 --> 00:00:40,708
The name's Roger Borniche,

2
00:00:41,584 --> 00:00:43,502
Inspector with the Federal Police.

3
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:45,171
I'm a cop.

4
00:00:45,296 --> 00:00:47,673
I love this goddamn profession.

5
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:50,551
But this morning, I'd rather
have stayed in bed with Catherine.

6
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:56,265
She wants to get married,
make it legal.

7
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:59,268
But I've got to become
chief investigator first.

8
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:01,645
I'm already doing the job.

9
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:03,898
I'm only lacking the title...

10
00:01:04,023 --> 00:01:05,733
and the salary.

11
00:01:06,442 --> 00:01:10,071
I've solved some major cases
since I've been in this joint.

12
00:01:10,196 --> 00:01:11,697
The boss can't deny that.

13
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:16,410
But that particular morning,

14
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:18,746
I had no idea what was about to pop up.

15
00:01:21,457 --> 00:01:22,833
Hi, Borniche.

16
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:27,505
Morning, Roger.

17
00:01:31,384 --> 00:01:32,760
Well?

18
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,762
Well, nothing.

19
00:01:37,056 --> 00:01:38,766
He's talking nonsense.

20
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:44,730
Leave me alone with him.

21
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:55,866
If you're so smart...

22
00:02:24,437 --> 00:02:26,564
I'd like to believe you, Raymond.

23
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:29,066
I always tell the truth.

24
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:32,861
So the day of the shooting,
the 17 Th, you weren't in Paris.

25
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:34,488
You were in Rouen.

26
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:37,616
At my brother-in-law's.
He'll confirm it.

27
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,620
They say they saw me in my bar,
but they were outside.

28
00:02:41,746 --> 00:02:44,165
They're obviously wrong.

29
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,626
Or they want you to do wrong.
I don't doubt it.

30
00:02:47,752 --> 00:02:51,339
Then why did your pals beat me up?

31
00:02:52,423 --> 00:02:54,133
They're impulsive.

32
00:02:55,051 --> 00:02:57,053
You too, sometimes.

33
00:02:57,178 --> 00:03:02,183
Not on the 17th,
but on the 16th, 20th or 22nd.

34
00:03:03,476 --> 00:03:05,436
All right.

35
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:08,606
I'm magnanimous.
I'll release you.

36
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:15,363
- What for?
- You give Lieutenant Clot information.

37
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:18,282
Why not let me have it first?

38
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:21,327
But I'm not an informer!

39
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:24,622
I could name some of the guys
you've brought down.

40
00:03:24,747 --> 00:03:28,292
Scumbags who worked for the Gestapo.

41
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:29,919
That's different.

42
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,422
You should've been decorated.

43
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,350
Right. I'll be right there.

44
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:48,145
Make up your mind.
I'm going to see the boss.

45
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,024
That'll give you some time
to think it over.

46
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:02,118
- Keep an eye on that guy.
- Sure, Roger.

47
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,547
Come in.

48
00:04:22,805 --> 00:04:24,181
Buisson has escaped.

49
00:04:24,807 --> 00:04:28,102
Buisson?
Never heard of him.

50
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:32,940
You weren't here
when he earned his stripes.

51
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:34,942
Fine list of holdups.

52
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:37,528
The Troyees Bank before the war.

53
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:42,366
In '42, the Victory Street holdup,
a cashier shot.

54
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:51,167
I want you to get Buisson
before Central does.

55
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:55,504
We'll show Clot
that the Federal Police exist,

56
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,341
that Central doesn't have
a monopoly on criminal oases.

57
00:04:58,466 --> 00:05:03,763
Careful.
Mr. Emile shoots fast and straight.

58
00:05:03,888 --> 00:05:05,973
Does that appeal to you?

59
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:08,351
If not, I'd be a salesman.

60
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:10,978
Go on, get your informers competing.

61
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:13,647
By the way,
I'd like to release Pelletier.

62
00:05:13,773 --> 00:05:16,359
That's going too far.

63
00:05:16,484 --> 00:05:19,570
The Spaniard was shot
coming out of his bar.

64
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:22,448
His Rouen alibi will hold.

65
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:25,242
I think he has a deal with Clot.

66
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,495
How about we cut in?

67
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:31,040
That's what I like to hear.

68
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:33,751
- It's up to you.
- I know.

69
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:37,755
Make Buisson a priority.
Get his file from the archives.

70
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:40,132
If you pull this off,

71
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:42,843
I promise you'll make
chief investigator this time.

72
00:05:52,103 --> 00:05:53,437
Say, guys.

73
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:55,523
The name Buisson
mean anything to you?

74
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:58,150
The gangster who
broke out of Villejuif?

75
00:05:58,943 --> 00:06:00,903
The chief wants us to get him.

76
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,075
Archives, please.

77
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:09,829
- What about Raymond?
- We let him go.

78
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,623
Speaking of which,

79
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,793
I don't much like your methods.

80
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:17,962
Want me to offer him a candy bar?

81
00:06:20,256 --> 00:06:21,966
That's an idea.

82
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:26,303
Roblin? Borniche here.

83
00:06:26,429 --> 00:06:28,973
Could I have Buisson's file?

84
00:06:29,682 --> 00:06:31,726
Emile Buisson.

85
00:06:32,435 --> 00:06:34,395
Thanks, I'll send Darros.

86
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,989
So, it's a deal.

87
00:06:45,948 --> 00:06:47,116
A deal?

88
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:49,118
I didn't agree to anything.

89
00:06:49,827 --> 00:06:51,704
If you don't agree,

90
00:06:52,705 --> 00:06:55,958
I'll make sure it gets around
that you inform for Clot.

91
00:06:58,753 --> 00:07:00,963
You must take me for a bitch.

92
00:07:03,007 --> 00:07:05,384
That's why I'm giving you
my phone number.

93
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:07,678
I'm a pervert.

94
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:09,764
I love bitches.

95
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:12,058
Anvers.

96
00:07:25,738 --> 00:07:28,115
My bar, can I open it?

97
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,742
Of course.

98
00:07:30,493 --> 00:07:34,246
If a certain Buisson ever stops by
for a drink, give me a call.

99
00:07:34,372 --> 00:07:37,541
Buisson? Are you crazy?

100
00:07:38,376 --> 00:07:39,835
You know him?

101
00:07:41,796 --> 00:07:44,131
Seen him around,
like lots of others.

102
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:48,219
Thought he was still in the can.

103
00:07:48,344 --> 00:07:51,764
He got out
on good behaviour.

104
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,959
My brother, Emile.
This is Suzanne.

105
00:09:03,711 --> 00:09:05,254
René's sister.

106
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,299
She was Pete the Saint's girl.

107
00:09:08,424 --> 00:09:10,801
Cops shot him
during the Marseilles holdup.

108
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:12,345
I know.

109
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:14,555
We'll stay here for a while.

110
00:09:16,724 --> 00:09:19,977
In any case, I can't go home.
The cops must be there.

111
00:09:20,102 --> 00:09:22,563
They'll check the files.

112
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:24,565
- The driver'?
- Mario the Wop?

113
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,860
He's dumping the car.
Don't worry. He's solid.

114
00:09:46,504 --> 00:09:50,049
When Mario comes back,
have him find another.

115
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:00,601
Do we need one just yet?

116
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:19,453
Suzanne, no errands to run?

117
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:30,047
Bring back the evening paper.

118
00:10:52,403 --> 00:10:54,697
Got a change of clothes?

119
00:10:54,822 --> 00:10:57,158
I want to go dancing this afternoon.

120
00:10:58,242 --> 00:11:00,578
Can't that wait?

121
00:11:00,703 --> 00:11:02,705
I hate to keep squealers waiting.

122
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,206
Cheers.

123
00:12:05,226 --> 00:12:06,560
Hello, baby cop.

124
00:12:06,686 --> 00:12:08,229
Hello, big girl.

125
00:12:09,647 --> 00:12:11,148
A good day?

126
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:12,650
Hectic.

127
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:16,404
Bernier was out.
I had to answer the phone.

128
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:19,156
A long wait for the bus.

129
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:21,242
No waiting on the subway.

130
00:12:21,826 --> 00:12:23,994
Roger, I have the car for Sunday.

131
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:27,123
The Talbot'? Fantastic.

132
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:32,628
I saw father at noon.
He gave in.

133
00:12:33,379 --> 00:12:35,548
It's hard to resist you.

134
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:39,218
If you'd been my daughter,
I would've made a very bad father.

135
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:41,971
What are we doing tonight?

136
00:12:42,096 --> 00:12:46,225
Nothing. I've got to read
these files for tomorrow.

137
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:48,477
Excuse me.

138
00:12:54,275 --> 00:12:56,360
Devil in the Flesh is playing.

139
00:12:58,863 --> 00:13:00,364
You promised we'd see it.

140
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:04,785
We'll go next week.
It'll play for a while.

141
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:12,918
Why don't you change careers?

142
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:16,422
Your attorney boss needs clients.

143
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:22,928
This the guy who escaped?

144
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:26,098
Yes, that's him.

145
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:28,392
He crazy?

146
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:34,106
He acts like it 'cause it's easier
to get out of madhouses than prisons.

147
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:36,025
Is he dangerous?

148
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,693
Very.

149
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:41,322
Probably because of his
unhappy childhood.

150
00:13:41,447 --> 00:13:44,241
His alcoholic father
made him steal food for them.

151
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:47,244
That doesn't make for a saint.

152
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:52,958
He's at the point of no return.

153
00:13:53,084 --> 00:13:55,419
All we can do for him

154
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:58,673
is keep him from killing
to save his neck.

155
00:13:58,798 --> 00:14:01,217
You should've been an attorney.

156
00:14:01,342 --> 00:14:02,718
Maybe.

157
00:14:08,766 --> 00:14:10,267
Borniche, Federal Police.

158
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:14,021
- Jean-Baptiste Buisson's file, please.
- Emile's brother?

159
00:14:14,146 --> 00:14:16,107
Everyone wants that one today.

160
00:14:18,401 --> 00:14:19,944
First row.

161
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:13,039
May I help you, gentlemen?

162
00:15:13,164 --> 00:15:14,832
Hands up.

163
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,586
Everyone up!

164
00:15:20,546 --> 00:15:22,590
Come on, hands up!

165
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:34,226
Bastards!

166
00:15:37,063 --> 00:15:39,398
Put the dough on the table.

167
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:41,442
Jewels, lighters, everything.

168
00:15:41,984 --> 00:15:43,361
Quick!

169
00:15:56,874 --> 00:15:58,250
Come on.

170
00:15:59,043 --> 00:16:00,670
Earrings.

171
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,691
The ring.

172
00:16:23,818 --> 00:16:25,194
Now!

173
00:16:36,872 --> 00:16:38,541
Don't move!

174
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:54,515
The cops.

175
00:17:47,526 --> 00:17:50,071
- You okay?
- Yes, fine. Get moving.

176
00:17:51,322 --> 00:17:53,574
Be careful, they shot at me.

177
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,797
Stop!

178
00:18:57,722 --> 00:18:59,432
Mado, open up.

179
00:19:12,695 --> 00:19:14,196
Is your man here?

180
00:19:19,869 --> 00:19:23,122
- What's the matter?
- We need to stay a minute.

181
00:19:23,247 --> 00:19:24,957
It's stormy outside.

182
00:19:29,962 --> 00:19:31,505
Good to see you, Raymond.

183
00:19:34,925 --> 00:19:36,427
I'll be damned!

184
00:19:38,012 --> 00:19:40,389
I wasn't expecting -

185
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:42,892
Can I wash up?

186
00:19:43,017 --> 00:19:45,353
Go right ahead.
There's water at the bar.

187
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:53,778
We'll go to the back room.

188
00:20:05,831 --> 00:20:08,292
You haven't changed in five years.

189
00:20:24,934 --> 00:20:26,644
That's a load.

190
00:20:26,769 --> 00:20:30,272
Grandma's inheritance.
We want top price.

191
00:20:31,023 --> 00:20:34,068
All right.
I'll see the Armenian tomorrow.

192
00:20:34,193 --> 00:20:35,945
You know his terms'?

193
00:20:37,363 --> 00:20:40,199
You'll get your cut,
but be quick.

194
00:20:41,075 --> 00:20:43,160
Thursday good?

195
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:45,204
Deal.

196
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:47,248
- 4:00.
- Fine.

197
00:20:47,873 --> 00:20:50,459
Mado, bring us a bottle.

198
00:20:56,632 --> 00:21:00,177
"Officer Schmitt Dies
as Result of Injuries."

199
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:02,346
That's pure Buisson.

200
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:05,307
Description fits.

201
00:21:05,433 --> 00:21:06,976
That's his style.

202
00:21:07,101 --> 00:21:10,438
The guy escapes,
forms a new team,

203
00:21:10,563 --> 00:21:12,481
and he's back in business.

204
00:21:13,024 --> 00:21:14,525
He doesn't waste any time.

205
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,193
Unlike you.

206
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:18,112
You're not getting anywhere.

207
00:21:18,237 --> 00:21:20,531
How can I get him in a week?

208
00:21:20,656 --> 00:21:24,285
- The press says you're a super cop.
- I could do without the press.

209
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:27,329
Listen up.
Just get moving.

210
00:21:28,289 --> 00:21:30,791
Central will spare no effort.

211
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,252
What exactly are you doing?

212
00:21:35,338 --> 00:21:38,049
Aside from smoking
one cigarette after another?

213
00:21:39,467 --> 00:21:40,968
Watching his brother's place.

214
00:21:41,093 --> 00:21:45,056
Central's guys are there already.
Find something else.

215
00:21:45,181 --> 00:21:47,558
I'm looking, Chief.

216
00:21:53,689 --> 00:21:55,900
Phone. Raymond Pelletier.

217
00:21:56,025 --> 00:21:57,568
Will only talk to you.

218
00:22:08,245 --> 00:22:09,955
Inspector?

219
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:13,876
It's about your friend.

220
00:22:14,001 --> 00:22:15,753
What friend?

221
00:22:16,921 --> 00:22:19,131
The one who's out
on good behaviour.

222
00:22:20,466 --> 00:22:22,426
Oh, I get you. Well?

223
00:22:24,053 --> 00:22:28,265
A man will come to my bar
at 4:00 on Thursday.

224
00:22:29,016 --> 00:22:30,726
Just follow him,

225
00:22:31,644 --> 00:22:33,979
and he'll lead you to the right place.

226
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,693
Fine. Thanks.

227
00:23:14,437 --> 00:23:16,147
There he goes.

228
00:23:17,064 --> 00:23:18,691
Let's go.

229
00:23:55,019 --> 00:23:56,562
We've met.

230
00:23:57,438 --> 00:23:59,523
- Where do you live?
- Paris.

231
00:24:00,941 --> 00:24:02,777
That's where I've seen you.

232
00:26:28,089 --> 00:26:29,965
DESIREE STREET

233
00:26:37,515 --> 00:26:39,141
May I use the phone?

234
00:26:39,266 --> 00:26:41,102
Give me a coffee.

235
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:52,279
In Marseilles.

236
00:26:53,197 --> 00:26:55,408
With my uncle.

237
00:27:11,465 --> 00:27:14,093
Hidoine just called.
Join him with the chief.

238
00:27:14,218 --> 00:27:15,928
Here's the address.

239
00:27:30,651 --> 00:27:33,571
I hope he'll confirm that.

240
00:27:33,696 --> 00:27:36,615
If not, we'll have to
have a little talk.

241
00:27:56,844 --> 00:27:58,554
- He's here.
- Where?

242
00:27:59,638 --> 00:28:02,224
You watch Desiree Street,
first on the left.

243
00:28:10,024 --> 00:28:12,568
I followed Jean-Baptiste Buisson here.

244
00:28:12,693 --> 00:28:14,695
He went into the building
at 8, Desiree Street.

245
00:28:15,613 --> 00:28:17,490
I'll stay with Hidoine and Darros.

246
00:28:17,615 --> 00:28:20,117
When we know exactly
where they live, I'll arrest them.

247
00:28:20,242 --> 00:28:21,911
By yourself, Dick Tracy?

248
00:28:22,036 --> 00:28:23,996
The local precinct will help.

249
00:28:24,872 --> 00:28:26,040
Got it.

250
00:28:26,165 --> 00:28:30,795
But if you lose Buisson,
I'll send you south after chicken thieves.

251
00:28:31,379 --> 00:28:32,880
I know.

252
00:28:56,112 --> 00:28:58,572
Robert, here's some food.

253
00:28:59,824 --> 00:29:01,951
A beer, the other's for Darros.

254
00:29:02,702 --> 00:29:04,370
Go easy on it.

255
00:29:13,379 --> 00:29:14,880
Get lost!

256
00:29:20,052 --> 00:29:22,221
- Here. Dying of hunger?
- Just about.

257
00:29:27,351 --> 00:29:29,353
Leave a little beer for me.

258
00:29:32,898 --> 00:29:34,275
Now what?

259
00:29:34,567 --> 00:29:36,444
It's too early to move in.

260
00:29:42,825 --> 00:29:44,869
What about those guys?

261
00:29:44,994 --> 00:29:47,747
Do they wait for dawn
to kill everyone?

262
00:31:20,715 --> 00:31:22,091
Goddamn!

263
00:31:22,508 --> 00:31:24,552
Hey, the cops!

264
00:31:24,677 --> 00:31:26,554
Cut the crap.

265
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:28,055
Get up!

266
00:31:28,973 --> 00:31:31,058
Emile, the cops! Quick!

267
00:31:38,315 --> 00:31:40,317
They tipped us off.

268
00:31:41,027 --> 00:31:43,237
Go upstairs and get out
by the roof. Hurry.

269
00:31:59,337 --> 00:32:00,880
I'll see if it's clear.

270
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,563
Quick, get out!

271
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:22,026
Stop! Police!

272
00:32:54,475 --> 00:32:55,976
Goddamn!

273
00:33:21,877 --> 00:33:23,421
The ambulance is coming.

274
00:33:37,309 --> 00:33:39,353
- Hello, Germaine.
- Morning, Chief.

275
00:33:45,693 --> 00:33:46,652
Hey, Borniche.

276
00:33:46,777 --> 00:33:49,947
For a former paratrooper,
you're not much of a jumper.

277
00:33:50,072 --> 00:33:51,032
Chief, please.

278
00:33:51,157 --> 00:33:55,327
If you'd pulled it off,
this mess with Central wouldn't matter.

279
00:33:55,453 --> 00:33:59,123
Clot claims he'd laid a trap for Buisson
and that we fouled it up.

280
00:33:59,248 --> 00:34:01,167
- Clot can go and -
- But in the mean time,

281
00:34:01,292 --> 00:34:03,419
we're in it up to our neck.

282
00:34:03,544 --> 00:34:05,671
Chief, we have Buisson's
brother and accomplice.

283
00:34:06,922 --> 00:34:08,466
- What is it?
- Still nothing.

284
00:34:08,591 --> 00:34:11,635
We're searching the area
room by room.

285
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,846
That's it.

286
00:34:13,971 --> 00:34:16,807
- See? Still nothing.
- So?

287
00:34:16,932 --> 00:34:19,268
The brother will need
a month in the hospital.

288
00:34:19,393 --> 00:34:22,646
- And the girl?
- She won't talk. She's a real lioness.

289
00:34:23,397 --> 00:34:26,108
I have a meeting
with the director at 2:00.

290
00:34:26,233 --> 00:34:28,235
You know what that means?

291
00:34:31,405 --> 00:34:34,116
Give me a detailed report.

292
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,463
Who's calling?

293
00:34:48,047 --> 00:34:49,423
Catherine.

294
00:34:56,555 --> 00:34:58,974
I'm fine. Who told you that?

295
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,935
A pack of lies!

296
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:03,896
Roger, why are you
talking to me like that?

297
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:07,775
I know. I'm sorry-

298
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,402
Forgive me.

299
00:35:09,985 --> 00:35:12,988
Really, I can't tell you.

300
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,075
I'll try to get free.

301
00:35:19,412 --> 00:35:20,996
I'll do my best.

302
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,082
That's it.

303
00:35:23,833 --> 00:35:25,793
I'll call this evening.

304
00:35:26,961 --> 00:35:28,337
Yes.

305
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,507
Yeah, love you too.

306
00:35:48,315 --> 00:35:51,027
But you don't understand.

307
00:35:51,152 --> 00:35:54,238
Three or four days
while I get him a room.

308
00:35:57,158 --> 00:35:58,534
Thanks.

309
00:36:05,082 --> 00:36:09,211
I've found a room in the suburbs.

310
00:36:09,962 --> 00:36:10,963
An old friend.

311
00:36:11,088 --> 00:36:13,591
When you see the Wop,
give him the address.

312
00:36:13,716 --> 00:36:16,594
Tell him to bring a Colt.45.

313
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:18,095
Okay.

314
00:36:22,767 --> 00:36:25,853
My God. You've had it, Bollec.

315
00:36:26,854 --> 00:36:30,149
I'll see you guillotined
together with the Buissons.

316
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:00,930
I'll bust your balls.

317
00:37:01,055 --> 00:37:03,724
You'll never use them again, you swine.

318
00:37:03,849 --> 00:37:05,393
Never again!

319
00:37:09,146 --> 00:37:12,483
So that wasn't Emile Buisson with you?

320
00:37:13,025 --> 00:37:16,112
It was -
What was his name?

321
00:37:16,654 --> 00:37:18,447
Repeat your bullshit.

322
00:37:18,572 --> 00:37:20,449
Repeat it!

323
00:37:20,574 --> 00:37:22,410
George Muller!

324
00:37:23,703 --> 00:37:25,579
That's the name I knew him by.

325
00:37:27,748 --> 00:37:31,168
I'll make you eat your own shit,
you bastard,

326
00:37:31,293 --> 00:37:33,713
if you go on taking me for a jerk!

327
00:37:37,383 --> 00:37:39,885
You're not in the slammer yet, buddy.

328
00:37:42,388 --> 00:37:45,975
He says the guy on the roof
wasn't Buisson.

329
00:37:47,935 --> 00:37:49,311
Interesting.

330
00:37:51,814 --> 00:37:55,401
We'll see if your statement
matches your sister's.

331
00:37:56,152 --> 00:37:58,070
Then we'll have a talk.

332
00:38:01,782 --> 00:38:03,784
You got a minute, Lucien?

333
00:38:17,173 --> 00:38:18,674
Now what is it?

334
00:38:19,258 --> 00:38:20,634
You know.

335
00:38:21,385 --> 00:38:23,721
Want me to give gifts
to a guy who kills a cop?

336
00:38:24,305 --> 00:38:26,223
Maybe it wasn't him.

337
00:38:26,807 --> 00:38:28,768
You can do your job without that.

338
00:38:31,937 --> 00:38:34,357
Roger, you're starting
to get on our nerves.

339
00:38:36,484 --> 00:38:39,737
You act important,
but you're not the boss.

340
00:38:42,031 --> 00:38:44,033
Guys like that are vermin.

341
00:38:44,575 --> 00:38:46,619
And vermin are for squashing, get it?

342
00:38:49,622 --> 00:38:53,376
If it had been your brother
or father that got gunned down,

343
00:38:53,501 --> 00:38:55,002
maybe you'd see it differently.

344
00:38:57,213 --> 00:38:59,423
- You think?
- Yes, I'm sure.

345
00:39:03,469 --> 00:39:06,555
Deep down,
you're nothing but an amateur.

346
00:39:13,562 --> 00:39:15,773
Let me tell you a story, Lucien.

347
00:39:15,898 --> 00:39:17,983
A story I never tell.

348
00:39:20,152 --> 00:39:21,987
Suppose I had a brother.

349
00:39:23,155 --> 00:39:25,157
A guy I loved a lot.

350
00:39:26,117 --> 00:39:29,161
In '44, the Lauriston Street
Gestapo got him.

351
00:39:29,704 --> 00:39:31,455
You catch my drift?

352
00:39:32,373 --> 00:39:35,084
They were so "nice" to him
that he died.

353
00:39:35,209 --> 00:39:36,585
Don't mix things up.

354
00:39:39,422 --> 00:39:41,465
I didn't join the force for that.

355
00:39:42,049 --> 00:39:44,885
When I joined up,
I knew I might be killed.

356
00:39:45,469 --> 00:39:48,556
But I knew that being a cop
doesn't put you above the law!

357
00:40:00,693 --> 00:40:02,862
Using certain methods...

358
00:40:03,612 --> 00:40:06,699
puts you lower down
than your so-called vermin.

359
00:40:15,833 --> 00:40:19,295
Have you sent
Hollec's P.38 to the lab?

360
00:40:21,422 --> 00:40:22,798
Yes.

361
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:04,423
- Nothing to tell me?
- I don't talk to cops.

362
00:41:06,384 --> 00:41:09,845
- You prefer crooks.
- To each his own.

363
00:41:11,097 --> 00:41:12,932
Crooks don't become a habit.

364
00:41:13,474 --> 00:41:16,227
My guys don't have time
to dirty the sheets.

365
00:41:19,021 --> 00:41:22,274
You'll be accused
of protecting a criminal.

366
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,318
That's rather good.

367
00:41:25,486 --> 00:41:28,406
Buisson is a killer.
He won't hesitate to kill you.

368
00:41:29,156 --> 00:41:31,617
Then it's normal to rat him out'?

369
00:41:49,218 --> 00:41:53,264
You had guns in your place,
and Buisson, who killed a patrolman.

370
00:41:54,181 --> 00:41:56,308
You'll be charged
along with the rest.

371
00:41:56,434 --> 00:41:57,810
If you like.

372
00:41:59,061 --> 00:42:03,566
Believe me, I'm not pleased that
you'll go in for four or five years.

373
00:42:10,322 --> 00:42:11,699
Thanks.

374
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:23,878
I won't insist.

375
00:42:24,587 --> 00:42:27,006
You don't cooperate,
I'll put you inside.

376
00:42:40,102 --> 00:42:41,604
Not bad, eh?

377
00:42:45,483 --> 00:42:48,527
- Mind if your brother's guillotined?
- He hasn't done anything!

378
00:42:49,945 --> 00:42:51,655
Unfortunately, he has.

379
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:54,950
And soon you'll have to choose
between Buisson and him.

380
00:43:00,081 --> 00:43:03,793
Well, my colleague
will ask you some questions.

381
00:43:04,835 --> 00:43:08,589
He'll note if you refuse to answer
or refuse to sign.

382
00:43:09,423 --> 00:43:10,925
There it is.

383
00:43:12,009 --> 00:43:14,762
You're in a real mess.

384
00:43:15,513 --> 00:43:18,224
Nobody but me has
the slightest wish to save you.

385
00:43:19,308 --> 00:43:20,685
How kind.

386
00:43:24,814 --> 00:43:26,357
All yours.

387
00:43:31,612 --> 00:43:33,823
Your name is Suzanne Bollec?

388
00:43:42,623 --> 00:43:44,834
Is this gun yours?

389
00:43:52,466 --> 00:43:54,427
You had it when we arrested you.

390
00:43:54,552 --> 00:43:56,887
- You gonna deny that?
- I didn't use it.

391
00:43:58,347 --> 00:44:01,434
You couldn't. It was jammed.

392
00:44:03,019 --> 00:44:05,312
Unfortunately for you,
I have the ballistics.

393
00:44:11,777 --> 00:44:13,988
Some bullets from your P.38...

394
00:44:15,406 --> 00:44:18,242
were found in the body
of Alfred Thibon...

395
00:44:19,702 --> 00:44:22,079
Freddy the Accordionist.

396
00:44:24,373 --> 00:44:26,959
Mean anything to you?

397
00:44:34,592 --> 00:44:37,094
He got taken out
on September 3,

398
00:44:37,219 --> 00:44:39,180
the same day Emile Buisson escaped.

399
00:44:41,766 --> 00:44:43,642
You don't waste time.

400
00:44:44,352 --> 00:44:46,228
I had nothing to do with it.

401
00:44:49,398 --> 00:44:51,275
But that's nothing.

402
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,445
Can't expect crooks to settle scores
with a kid's game.

403
00:44:59,575 --> 00:45:04,288
But your little gun
also killed Officer Schmitt,

404
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:07,416
highway patrolman
and father of three.

405
00:45:08,334 --> 00:45:11,170
Photo enlargement leaves no doubt.

406
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:18,219
Look at your gun.

407
00:45:21,764 --> 00:45:24,058
It's gonna cost you, René.

408
00:45:25,893 --> 00:45:27,269
It's not mine!

409
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,357
No need to shout.

410
00:45:34,151 --> 00:45:35,528
I showed it to your sister.

411
00:45:37,113 --> 00:45:38,614
She recognized it.

412
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:42,076
I doubt it.
She doesn't know a thing about guns.

413
00:45:51,752 --> 00:45:54,088
Then tell me why
you had it on you.

414
00:45:55,172 --> 00:45:59,802
When I was clearing out,
I took the first I found.

415
00:46:01,053 --> 00:46:02,430
But it's not mine.

416
00:46:02,555 --> 00:46:04,598
Then it's Emile Buisson's.

417
00:46:06,726 --> 00:46:08,853
He wasn't with us.

418
00:46:08,978 --> 00:46:10,563
Oh, yeah. That's right.

419
00:46:10,688 --> 00:46:12,732
It was -
What's his name?

420
00:46:15,693 --> 00:46:18,154
That's right, Muller.

421
00:46:19,405 --> 00:46:21,615
So it's Muller's gun.

422
00:46:24,285 --> 00:46:26,287
You expect me to believe that?

423
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:34,337
I hope you like escargot.

424
00:46:34,462 --> 00:46:35,963
They're very good.

425
00:46:37,214 --> 00:46:41,344
A police officer brings them
from the countryside.

426
00:46:43,137 --> 00:46:44,847
It's Sunday tomorrow.

427
00:46:45,556 --> 00:46:48,309
Shall I wake you for church,

428
00:46:49,226 --> 00:46:50,936
Mr. Chabert?

429
00:46:53,064 --> 00:46:57,818
I guess you don't like priests too much.

430
00:47:40,945 --> 00:47:42,738
You were lucky.

431
00:47:44,323 --> 00:47:45,700
Glad to see you.

432
00:47:52,873 --> 00:47:54,625
Bring the supplies?

433
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,006
Get me a grenade.

434
00:48:00,589 --> 00:48:04,176
A fragmentation grenade
from the army.

435
00:48:04,802 --> 00:48:06,804
What the heck
you gonna do with that?

436
00:48:06,929 --> 00:48:10,391
Blow up the first cop
that comes my way.

437
00:48:27,742 --> 00:48:29,952
- I went to the Armenian.
- And?

438
00:48:30,077 --> 00:48:32,496
Disappeared two days ago
with the stuff.

439
00:48:32,621 --> 00:48:34,165
What you make of that?

440
00:48:46,177 --> 00:48:48,346
The doctor said
not to take too long.

441
00:48:48,471 --> 00:48:50,014
Number four.

442
00:49:09,617 --> 00:49:11,994
I thought I smelled a pig.

443
00:49:12,578 --> 00:49:14,246
Have a seat.

444
00:49:23,506 --> 00:49:25,716
Good of you to come.

445
00:49:25,841 --> 00:49:29,136
I get bored, miss my friends.

446
00:49:29,679 --> 00:49:31,555
What's your name?

447
00:49:32,473 --> 00:49:34,517
You've got the roles backwards,
Jean-Baptiste.

448
00:49:34,642 --> 00:49:37,895
Why should cops
always ask the questions?

449
00:49:40,189 --> 00:49:42,775
You the famous Borniche?

450
00:49:47,196 --> 00:49:49,532
I hear you eat grilled gangster
for breakfast.

451
00:49:51,325 --> 00:49:54,036
About the Arbois Inn
and Officer Schmitt.

452
00:49:54,161 --> 00:49:55,830
There's little time. You're tired.

453
00:49:55,955 --> 00:49:58,499
I'm fine. Stay as long as you like.

454
00:49:59,917 --> 00:50:03,796
Bollec has confessed. This is routine.

455
00:50:07,383 --> 00:50:08,759
Got a smoke?

456
00:50:20,938 --> 00:50:23,774
I'll have one later
while thinking of you.

457
00:50:24,525 --> 00:50:26,777
Thanks, kid.
Got a light?

458
00:50:44,337 --> 00:50:46,297
The name of your guy?

459
00:50:47,006 --> 00:50:49,759
René Bollec.

460
00:50:52,136 --> 00:50:53,512
Never heard of him.

461
00:50:54,805 --> 00:50:56,182
Ever hear of your brother?

462
00:50:58,351 --> 00:51:00,519
I read he'd escaped.

463
00:51:00,644 --> 00:51:04,774
I'll tell you his problem.
He was in bad company.

464
00:51:04,899 --> 00:51:08,319
Otherwise, he never would've
hurt anyone, not even a cop.

465
00:51:10,529 --> 00:51:11,864
I'm sure of it.

466
00:51:11,989 --> 00:51:16,118
September 3, I was in Dijon.
My sister will confirm it.

467
00:51:17,244 --> 00:51:20,081
Hope you have
another alibi for the court.

468
00:51:22,124 --> 00:51:25,211
Borniche,
I don't want to waste your time.

469
00:51:25,336 --> 00:51:28,589
I'm 52.
I'm not about to fall into your traps.

470
00:51:28,714 --> 00:51:30,758
I know nothing.

471
00:51:30,883 --> 00:51:33,010
I lost my memory in 1937.

472
00:51:33,135 --> 00:51:34,637
Exactly 10 years ago.

473
00:51:35,221 --> 00:51:37,848
Covered by the statute of limitations.

474
00:51:38,432 --> 00:51:41,394
If you get that,
you got it all.

475
00:51:42,186 --> 00:51:43,854
Leaving already?

476
00:51:43,979 --> 00:51:46,941
I got it all.
No need for a statement.

477
00:51:50,194 --> 00:51:53,197
- Here. It's the real stuff.
- Thanks, cop.

478
00:51:53,948 --> 00:51:56,992
Deep down, you're not a bad guy.
Come back to see me.

479
00:51:57,535 --> 00:52:01,497
I'll tell you all about Indochina.
It might teach you something.

480
00:52:01,622 --> 00:52:04,083
I'll leave the teaching
To Judge Boissenade.

481
00:52:04,792 --> 00:52:07,461
You'll see.
He's a very serious guy.

482
00:52:08,212 --> 00:52:11,632
That's all we need, the justice system
in the hands of clowns.

483
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:17,471
Bye, Borniche.

484
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:22,727
If you see Emile,
say hello for me.

485
00:52:29,525 --> 00:52:31,068
If you have time.

486
00:52:46,417 --> 00:52:47,960
Hands on the bar, Raymond.

487
00:52:59,597 --> 00:53:01,557
What's the matter, Emile?

488
00:53:01,682 --> 00:53:03,517
Where are the jewels?

489
00:53:03,642 --> 00:53:06,854
The Armenian, he's checking them.

490
00:53:07,396 --> 00:53:08,939
I told your brother.

491
00:53:09,065 --> 00:53:11,067
You know where he is?

492
00:53:12,151 --> 00:53:14,028
Must have heard it on the radio.

493
00:53:15,279 --> 00:53:16,989
I just came down.

494
00:53:17,782 --> 00:53:19,325
I went to bed late.

495
00:53:19,950 --> 00:53:21,452
You bastard!

496
00:53:51,565 --> 00:53:53,567
Borniche, Federal Police.

497
00:53:56,278 --> 00:54:00,408
Raymond Pelletier, the owner.
Shot behind his bar.

498
00:54:12,962 --> 00:54:15,214
Buisson?

499
00:54:15,339 --> 00:54:18,634
I was upstairs. I saw nothing.

500
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,722
I came down when I heard the shots.

501
00:54:24,015 --> 00:54:26,475
Did he come here?

502
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,894
Did he come to see Raymond last week?

503
00:54:30,604 --> 00:54:33,607
Raymond was straight.

504
00:54:36,027 --> 00:54:38,404
It's disgusting to kill him like that.

505
00:54:44,744 --> 00:54:47,830
Buisson's crazy.
You don't have to protect him.

506
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:52,960
Who was With him?

507
00:54:53,085 --> 00:54:54,962
Leave me alone.

508
00:54:55,755 --> 00:54:57,465
Isn't this enough?

509
00:54:58,007 --> 00:55:00,760
Who did he come with last week?

510
00:55:02,178 --> 00:55:04,263
His brother and...

511
00:55:06,098 --> 00:55:07,475
And?

512
00:55:11,270 --> 00:55:12,646
Mario.

513
00:55:14,523 --> 00:55:16,025
A wop.

514
00:55:17,985 --> 00:55:19,695
He has a woman.

515
00:55:20,654 --> 00:55:23,157
She's a hooker near St. Denis.

516
00:55:23,741 --> 00:55:25,242
Know her name?

517
00:55:27,661 --> 00:55:29,038
Jenny.

518
00:55:32,416 --> 00:55:34,126
Is that all you can tell me?

519
00:55:34,251 --> 00:55:35,920
Isn't that enough?

520
00:55:38,422 --> 00:55:41,258
She's blond, Polish.

521
00:55:48,683 --> 00:55:50,810
Thanks, Mado.

522
00:55:58,776 --> 00:56:01,612
The Polack's in a meeting.
Choose another one.

523
00:56:03,447 --> 00:56:07,576
She just went up, I'll call.

524
00:56:08,911 --> 00:56:10,287
I don't want her.

525
00:56:20,131 --> 00:56:21,799
I want the Wop.

526
00:56:23,592 --> 00:56:25,136
What? The Wop?

527
00:56:26,554 --> 00:56:28,055
I'm in a hurry.

528
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:30,725
Perhaps you don't know Mario the Wop.

529
00:56:32,143 --> 00:56:34,812
I do, but I never see him.

530
00:56:38,149 --> 00:56:40,109
Do your best to see him.

531
00:56:40,651 --> 00:56:42,528
If not, I'll have this rotten joint busted

532
00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:47,616
I've got reasons enough
to put you in the slammer.

533
00:56:49,410 --> 00:56:50,786
Like the plan?

534
00:56:52,288 --> 00:56:53,998
He never comes here, I swear.

535
00:56:59,211 --> 00:57:01,797
He works in the Etoile area.

536
00:57:02,715 --> 00:57:07,053
You can call him at the Calanques Bar.

537
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:12,600
I knew you wanted
to help your country.

538
00:57:13,351 --> 00:57:16,312
If he's really done something wrong,

539
00:57:16,437 --> 00:57:18,606
it's only natural I should help a bit.

540
00:57:18,731 --> 00:57:20,232
It's only natural.

541
00:57:21,108 --> 00:57:22,485
There.

542
00:57:25,237 --> 00:57:27,448
- Evening.
- Number four.

543
00:57:28,532 --> 00:57:30,534
Don't forget the tip, baby.

544
00:57:36,916 --> 00:57:38,292
Go on.

545
00:58:14,745 --> 00:58:17,498
Help! Robbery!

546
00:58:21,627 --> 00:58:23,629
What's gotten into you?
You crazy?

547
00:58:45,818 --> 00:58:47,486
Call me at the Calanques.

548
00:58:47,611 --> 00:58:49,238
I'll call you at the Calanques.

549
00:59:17,183 --> 00:59:18,893
I came to make your bed.

550
00:59:22,229 --> 00:59:24,148
I didn't ask you to.

551
00:59:25,274 --> 00:59:29,403
- What are you looking for?
- Nothing. Now I know who you are.

552
00:59:33,657 --> 00:59:35,368
I just want to help.

553
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:43,209
Get out of here
and don't come back.

554
00:59:59,934 --> 01:00:02,103
Wait at the end of the street.

555
01:00:06,357 --> 01:00:09,360
- Don't be long.
- Ten minutes.

556
01:00:09,485 --> 01:00:12,947
- Let's not miss the beginning.
- You'll see the movie.

557
01:00:39,348 --> 01:00:40,891
Evening, Ange.

558
01:00:50,317 --> 01:00:51,861
Evening, Inspector.

559
01:00:52,611 --> 01:00:54,321
Give me a martini.

560
01:00:59,201 --> 01:01:02,038
- What's wrong, Ange?
- Nothing, I'm fine.

561
01:01:02,163 --> 01:01:03,831
You don't look it.

562
01:01:03,956 --> 01:01:07,418
A little nauseous.
I must've eaten something bad.

563
01:01:08,502 --> 01:01:10,504
Take care of your health, Ange.

564
01:01:12,256 --> 01:01:14,842
We'd hate to lose you.

565
01:01:26,145 --> 01:01:27,688
Know him?

566
01:01:30,483 --> 01:01:32,026
An Italian.

567
01:01:33,027 --> 01:01:34,737
I'm told he comes here.

568
01:01:36,822 --> 01:01:39,075
You were told wrong, Inspector.

569
01:01:44,330 --> 01:01:46,040
Evil gossip.

570
01:01:46,165 --> 01:01:48,376
The Italian do anything wrong?

571
01:01:49,126 --> 01:01:52,380
Think about it. When we want someone,
it's for his own good.

572
01:01:52,505 --> 01:01:53,923
That's true.

573
01:01:57,218 --> 01:01:59,637
No, you'll offend me.

574
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:02,264
Then I'll offend you.

575
01:02:04,350 --> 01:02:06,060
See you soon, Ange.

576
01:02:08,854 --> 01:02:10,231
Night.

577
01:02:33,045 --> 01:02:34,422
You know who just left?

578
01:02:35,506 --> 01:02:36,882
A cop.

579
01:02:37,383 --> 01:02:39,760
Not just any cop,
Inspector Borniche.

580
01:02:42,763 --> 01:02:44,473
What did he want?

581
01:02:45,182 --> 01:02:47,601
To know if Mario came here.

582
01:02:48,519 --> 01:02:50,187
That's interesting.

583
01:02:56,485 --> 01:02:57,862
Damn.

584
01:02:58,195 --> 01:03:00,031
I was scared.

585
01:03:01,198 --> 01:03:03,075
You should've told me.

586
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:06,078
I would have shot your buddy.

587
01:03:16,005 --> 01:03:20,092
Bullets from the same Colt 45.

588
01:03:22,261 --> 01:03:23,637
Well?

589
01:03:23,804 --> 01:03:27,433
The same gun killed Pelletier
and the bank collector.

590
01:03:27,558 --> 01:03:29,060
Buisson again.

591
01:03:32,646 --> 01:03:34,690
They want you to listen to the tapes.

592
01:03:34,815 --> 01:03:37,234
I had the phone
in the Calanques Bar tapped.

593
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:40,154
A friend of Buisson's receives calls there.
You never know.

594
01:03:40,738 --> 01:03:42,406
Thanks, Mr. Legal.

595
01:03:52,625 --> 01:03:54,001
What weather.

596
01:03:54,126 --> 01:03:56,003
All we need is snow.

597
01:03:59,965 --> 01:04:01,842
Got another recording.

598
01:04:01,967 --> 01:04:03,678
Somebody called for Mario.

599
01:04:05,554 --> 01:04:07,139
It must be Buisson.

600
01:04:07,264 --> 01:04:09,350
Don't come. I've moved.

601
01:04:10,685 --> 01:04:12,186
What time tomorrow?

602
01:04:12,311 --> 01:04:14,980
5:00 in Vincennes Forest,
Champigny Highway.

603
01:04:15,564 --> 01:04:17,274
Where exactly?

604
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:19,318
The Fourchette,
behind the yellow cabin.

605
01:04:19,443 --> 01:04:22,405
- What car?
- A black Simca 1000.

606
01:04:22,530 --> 01:04:23,948
Bye, Mario. See you tomorrow.

607
01:05:40,399 --> 01:05:41,942
Roger, he's leaving.

608
01:05:45,071 --> 01:05:46,614
Let him go.

609
01:05:47,281 --> 01:05:48,824
We'll get him at the Calanques.

610
01:05:48,949 --> 01:05:50,534
If he sees he's followed, it's over.

611
01:05:52,661 --> 01:05:54,205
I'll never get it.

612
01:05:54,747 --> 01:05:56,082
Bust our ass to catch guys,

613
01:05:56,207 --> 01:05:58,793
and once we get them,
we let them go.

614
01:06:10,137 --> 01:06:11,806
I waited over an hour.

615
01:06:13,432 --> 01:06:15,643
It's odd he didn't show up.

616
01:06:17,269 --> 01:06:20,106
He changes his mind sometimes.

617
01:06:21,190 --> 01:06:24,193
Put yourself in his shoes.
On the run, you get wary.

618
01:06:25,444 --> 01:06:29,031
We should visit the factory
in St. Denis.

619
01:06:31,409 --> 01:06:34,370
There's no time to loose.
Payday is Tuesday.

620
01:06:34,495 --> 01:06:36,205
Yes, it's urgent.

621
01:06:47,258 --> 01:06:48,634
Gentlemen.

622
01:07:10,364 --> 01:07:11,741
Hello.

623
01:07:12,575 --> 01:07:16,370
Jeannot, the friend I told you about
for the next job.

624
01:07:26,589 --> 01:07:28,257
I don't get it, Emile.

625
01:07:28,382 --> 01:07:30,259
About the meeting?

626
01:07:31,635 --> 01:07:33,346
I'll explain later.

627
01:07:34,263 --> 01:07:36,098
- Miss.
- Coming.

628
01:07:37,516 --> 01:07:39,393
My treat.

629
01:07:40,686 --> 01:07:42,730
Looks like the food's good here.

630
01:07:42,855 --> 01:07:44,357
Very good.

631
01:07:45,274 --> 01:07:47,443
I didn't expect to see you here.

632
01:07:47,568 --> 01:07:49,111
You know...

633
01:07:51,072 --> 01:07:52,990
no one ever expects to see me.

634
01:07:53,115 --> 01:07:55,534
Sometimes I just show up.

635
01:08:04,794 --> 01:08:07,546
What does that mean, Emile?

636
01:08:10,716 --> 01:08:12,093
Nothing.

637
01:08:12,677 --> 01:08:14,512
I'm having a laugh.

638
01:08:15,262 --> 01:08:17,306
I like to have a laugh
now and then.

639
01:08:18,683 --> 01:08:22,019
Paulo said you ate here often,
so we stopped by just in case.

640
01:08:23,437 --> 01:08:25,314
I'll take a pâté to start.

641
01:08:27,858 --> 01:08:29,235
Me too.

642
01:08:41,163 --> 01:08:44,375
Good night, gentlemen.

643
01:08:48,254 --> 01:08:52,091
Come to my place for a drink?

644
01:08:52,967 --> 01:08:54,093
Where's that?

645
01:08:54,218 --> 01:08:57,471
Ville d'Avray. I've got a little place
on the road to Versailles.

646
01:08:58,014 --> 01:09:01,517
I've got a date with a girl
when she gets off work.

647
01:09:01,642 --> 01:09:03,144
She can wait.

648
01:09:03,269 --> 01:09:05,479
It's good for chicks.

649
01:09:08,274 --> 01:09:10,234
You can't refuse a drink.

650
01:09:38,679 --> 01:09:40,681
Must be the ignition.

651
01:09:45,269 --> 01:09:47,688
I'll take a leak.

652
01:09:48,397 --> 01:09:50,399
Not a bad idea.

653
01:10:12,338 --> 01:10:14,048
Now, Wop!

654
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:17,885
What are you doing, Emile?

655
01:10:18,761 --> 01:10:21,681
Born in the Year of the Rat,
weren't you?

656
01:10:23,808 --> 01:10:25,351
You crazy?

657
01:10:26,102 --> 01:10:27,770
You asshole.

658
01:10:29,563 --> 01:10:31,774
You keep out of this.

659
01:10:40,157 --> 01:10:41,534
Paulo.

660
01:10:44,161 --> 01:10:45,538
The Wop was an informer.

661
01:10:48,332 --> 01:10:50,418
I didn't have time to warn you.

662
01:10:51,669 --> 01:10:54,797
The cops were waiting
at the meeting spot today.

663
01:11:00,094 --> 01:11:02,346
He won't be chatting
with them anymore.

664
01:11:51,354 --> 01:11:53,939
Let's clear out.
Quick.

665
01:12:11,957 --> 01:12:13,334
Hurry UP!

666
01:12:16,295 --> 01:12:18,005
Quick!

667
01:12:34,855 --> 01:12:36,357
The bastard.

668
01:12:38,150 --> 01:12:43,155
"Worker, Former Resistance Member,
Victim of Killer Buisson."

669
01:12:43,823 --> 01:12:47,576
"Our friend Guégan
gave his life for Capital."

670
01:12:47,702 --> 01:12:51,664
"While Mr. Jules Moch's police
are beating up miners in the north,"

671
01:12:51,789 --> 01:12:56,377
"...Emile Buisson is still on the loose,
shamelessly killing innocent workers."

672
01:12:56,502 --> 01:12:59,755
"What are the geniuses
at the Federal Police up to?"

673
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:03,342
"Where are these cops,"

674
01:13:03,467 --> 01:13:07,096
"...called 'supermen' by certain
members of the press corps."

675
01:13:07,221 --> 01:13:09,056
That's for Borniche.

676
01:13:09,807 --> 01:13:14,311
They attack Moch, he'll attack us.

677
01:13:14,437 --> 01:13:16,981
Not to mention the unions.

678
01:13:17,106 --> 01:13:19,191
Right now, it's a big joke.

679
01:13:19,775 --> 01:13:22,153
- Where's Borniche?
- It's his day off.

680
01:13:22,278 --> 01:13:24,488
I'll give him a goddamn day off!

681
01:13:24,613 --> 01:13:27,950
Along with the whole bunch of you!

682
01:13:28,075 --> 01:13:29,994
The Buisson case is closed!

683
01:13:30,619 --> 01:13:32,329
I'm taking you off it.

684
01:13:35,541 --> 01:13:37,793
Get me Borniche at home.

685
01:13:38,502 --> 01:13:40,046
Yeah, hurry up.

686
01:13:47,094 --> 01:13:49,055
Good morning.

687
01:13:49,180 --> 01:13:51,057
Yes, he's here.
I'll get him.

688
01:14:02,443 --> 01:14:04,028
It's for you.

689
01:14:04,153 --> 01:14:06,364
- Who is it?
- The boss.

690
01:14:11,869 --> 01:14:13,704
Morning, Chief.

691
01:14:15,664 --> 01:14:17,166
I can't answer so fast.

692
01:14:17,291 --> 01:14:19,377
You know I've done everything I could.

693
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:27,677
Okay.

694
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:31,597
As you like.

695
01:14:32,515 --> 01:14:36,477
I'm more likely to get him
than Degreffe.

696
01:14:40,856 --> 01:14:42,900
See you tomorrow, sir.

697
01:15:26,277 --> 01:15:27,778
What was that about?

698
01:15:29,238 --> 01:15:31,657
I'm off the Buisson case.

699
01:15:31,782 --> 01:15:34,326
He woke you to say that?
He's insane.

700
01:15:35,536 --> 01:15:37,371
He's a civil servant.

701
01:15:37,496 --> 01:15:39,040
He's afraid of his superiors.

702
01:15:39,582 --> 01:15:41,917
You can't let yourself
be abused like that.

703
01:15:52,845 --> 01:15:54,555
Some days.

704
01:15:57,183 --> 01:15:59,268
Some days what?

705
01:16:01,020 --> 01:16:03,773
I'd like to be Emile Buisson.

706
01:16:07,902 --> 01:16:09,612
For God's sake!

707
01:16:11,864 --> 01:16:13,574
10,000 bread tickets,

708
01:16:13,699 --> 01:16:16,410
as many gasoline tickets,
and you deny it?

709
01:16:17,328 --> 01:16:20,664
What, the devil goes to work
in your print shop at night?

710
01:16:21,499 --> 01:16:24,418
You should check my employees.

711
01:16:40,601 --> 01:16:42,436
Nice work.

712
01:16:43,521 --> 01:16:45,189
Come on.

713
01:16:46,107 --> 01:16:47,608
Be reasonable.

714
01:16:47,733 --> 01:16:50,861
If not,
we might get mad.

715
01:16:51,404 --> 01:16:53,280
Come with me.

716
01:16:53,406 --> 01:16:55,950
A corpse near Versailles.

717
01:16:56,075 --> 01:16:58,035
The chief chose us.

718
01:16:59,704 --> 01:17:01,247
How kind.

719
01:17:02,498 --> 01:17:04,208
I'll leave you with him.

720
01:17:10,506 --> 01:17:13,259
I advise you not to waste our time.

721
01:18:18,783 --> 01:18:22,536
Didn't find much.
A settling of scores.

722
01:18:23,287 --> 01:18:24,663
Let's see the face.

723
01:18:32,380 --> 01:18:33,881
Come look.

724
01:18:34,799 --> 01:18:36,550
Looks like the Wop.

725
01:18:37,593 --> 01:18:38,969
Mario?

726
01:18:41,889 --> 01:18:44,058
I'm sure of it.

727
01:18:44,183 --> 01:18:46,185
I'll be damned.

728
01:18:48,145 --> 01:18:49,689
How's that for luck?

729
01:18:49,814 --> 01:18:51,315
You know him?

730
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,610
Probably know who killed him too.

731
01:19:03,285 --> 01:19:04,995
That's great!

732
01:19:05,121 --> 01:19:06,956
Now you interfere in our work!

733
01:19:07,081 --> 01:19:08,582
Turn it down a notch.

734
01:19:08,708 --> 01:19:12,086
What do you want?
Got a warrant?

735
01:19:12,211 --> 01:19:13,879
Warrant or not,
you're coming with us.

736
01:19:14,005 --> 01:19:16,757
I am not!
I wasn't soliciting!

737
01:19:16,882 --> 01:19:18,718
That guy your fiancé?

738
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:22,346
We're just looking for
Mario's murderer. That's all.

739
01:19:23,597 --> 01:19:25,433
I don't give a damn about him!

740
01:19:25,558 --> 01:19:28,728
I got nothing to do with him.
If he croaked, that's too bad.

741
01:19:28,853 --> 01:19:31,230
I left him more than a year ago.

742
01:19:31,355 --> 01:19:34,150
Want me to give him
a first class funeral?

743
01:19:34,817 --> 01:19:36,277
Maybe you know his friends.

744
01:19:36,402 --> 01:19:38,738
I know nothing!
And I've got nothing to say!

745
01:19:39,321 --> 01:19:41,532
All I got to give is my ass!

746
01:19:41,657 --> 01:19:43,951
That good enough for you?

747
01:19:44,076 --> 01:19:47,288
Whatever you say, Jenny.
We might take you up on that.

748
01:19:47,413 --> 01:19:50,750
That's it!
The pigs will send me a ham.

749
01:19:50,875 --> 01:19:52,376
For Christmas.

750
01:20:00,468 --> 01:20:02,053
What you laughing at, jerk?

751
01:20:04,722 --> 01:20:06,098
Come to think of it,

752
01:20:07,016 --> 01:20:09,310
you knew him too,

753
01:20:09,435 --> 01:20:11,604
Mario the Wop?

754
01:20:11,729 --> 01:20:13,981
No, not well.

755
01:20:14,565 --> 01:20:16,233
His friends?

756
01:20:16,359 --> 01:20:18,110
I never saw his friends.

757
01:20:19,862 --> 01:20:22,073
You never saw anyone in the bar?

758
01:20:22,198 --> 01:20:24,200
No, I swear, Inspector.

759
01:20:30,748 --> 01:20:32,666
Just warming up.

760
01:20:32,792 --> 01:20:35,169
- My glasses.
- Don't need to see.

761
01:20:35,753 --> 01:20:37,421
Just need to talk.

762
01:20:38,714 --> 01:20:40,216
You skunk.

763
01:20:41,008 --> 01:20:42,385
Well?

764
01:20:43,969 --> 01:20:46,263
Who did Mario see?

765
01:20:47,390 --> 01:20:50,601
If you got nothing to say,
we'll get you for running a whorehouse.

766
01:20:50,726 --> 01:20:52,687
Your deal with the Vice Squad
won't help!

767
01:20:52,812 --> 01:20:54,897
I don't know.

768
01:20:55,648 --> 01:20:57,066
Sometimes he came with Paulo.

769
01:20:57,191 --> 01:20:58,526
Paulo?

770
01:20:58,651 --> 01:20:59,860
Paulo what?

771
01:20:59,985 --> 01:21:03,614
The bomber, his wife is sick.

772
01:21:04,865 --> 01:21:10,079
- Syphilis?
- No, TB. She's in a home.

773
01:21:11,497 --> 01:21:13,374
Where does he live?

774
01:21:13,499 --> 01:21:15,418
I don't know.

775
01:21:17,044 --> 01:21:18,838
It's probably in our files.

776
01:21:23,050 --> 01:21:24,593
Come on.

777
01:21:31,809 --> 01:21:33,519
Alias Paulo the Bomber.

778
01:21:33,644 --> 01:21:37,273
Listed in the special file,
"The Fight Against Gangsters."

779
01:21:37,857 --> 01:21:42,319
Paul Roubier, alias Paulo the Bomber.
Born March 29, 1904.

780
01:21:45,865 --> 01:21:47,825
This might be a good lead.

781
01:21:50,327 --> 01:21:52,288
- Well?
- Look.

782
01:21:52,413 --> 01:21:54,957
With Buisson in '42
at the Victories Street holdup.

783
01:21:55,082 --> 01:21:57,460
They got off for lack of proof.

784
01:21:57,585 --> 01:21:59,295
Victories or Victory Street?

785
01:21:59,420 --> 01:22:00,921
Victories.

786
01:22:01,505 --> 01:22:03,382
I'll send out a wanted notice.

787
01:22:04,633 --> 01:22:06,635
No, just find his wife.

788
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:09,096
What?

789
01:22:27,198 --> 01:22:29,158
Don't be sad.

790
01:22:30,576 --> 01:22:32,453
See you next week.

791
01:23:10,199 --> 01:23:12,910
- Give me a ride to Paris, Roubier?
- What do you want?

792
01:23:13,035 --> 01:23:15,276
We're not in the same club,
but we can still have a chat.

793
01:23:16,872 --> 01:23:21,585
The Pacra factory is offering a million
to anyone helping to arrest the killer.

794
01:23:22,753 --> 01:23:24,630
The killer is Emile Buisson.

795
01:23:27,425 --> 01:23:29,760
You've worked for less.

796
01:23:30,636 --> 01:23:32,972
Get that crooked head thinking.

797
01:23:36,475 --> 01:23:39,270
What you're doing is disgusting.

798
01:23:42,064 --> 01:23:44,650
If you refuse,
it'll get even more disgusting.

799
01:23:45,901 --> 01:23:48,988
You need streptomycin
to save your wife.

800
01:23:49,822 --> 01:23:52,825
I promise I'll get it from the States.

801
01:23:55,786 --> 01:23:59,415
You gonna hesitate between
a killer like Buisson and your wife?

802
01:24:04,670 --> 01:24:06,380
Another thing.

803
01:24:08,215 --> 01:24:10,801
I know you were a friend of
Mario the Wop.

804
01:24:12,386 --> 01:24:15,473
Emile killed him for nothing.

805
01:24:18,642 --> 01:24:20,853
The Wop wasn't an informer.

806
01:24:21,437 --> 01:24:23,606
Mr. Emile got that one wrong.

807
01:24:24,190 --> 01:24:26,734
We'll spread the word around.

808
01:24:36,202 --> 01:24:38,704
But in case you don't cooperate,

809
01:24:38,829 --> 01:24:41,248
I'm sure you were
in the latest holdups.

810
01:24:43,042 --> 01:24:44,585
And I'll prove it.

811
01:24:45,586 --> 01:24:48,673
I'll send you up
for 15 to 20 years.

812
01:24:49,423 --> 01:24:51,801
You'll never see your wife again.

813
01:25:04,271 --> 01:25:05,773
I hate myself.

814
01:25:14,365 --> 01:25:15,866
Me too.

815
01:25:16,784 --> 01:25:18,786
But we have no choice,

816
01:25:19,912 --> 01:25:22,498
either one of us.

817
01:25:46,105 --> 01:25:47,648
Hi.

818
01:25:51,277 --> 01:25:54,530
A tip, the Versailles tax office.

819
01:25:54,655 --> 01:25:56,323
There's a pile.

820
01:25:56,907 --> 01:25:59,118
- How much?
- 12 to 15 grand.

821
01:26:00,745 --> 01:26:01,871
The hideout?

822
01:26:01,996 --> 01:26:04,915
I found something
in the countryside, a hotel.

823
01:26:05,041 --> 01:26:06,584
I know the owner.

824
01:26:09,045 --> 01:26:11,047
Gotta find me a piece.

825
01:26:11,797 --> 01:26:13,841
Mine's hot.
It's gotta go down the drain.

826
01:26:13,966 --> 01:26:15,926
I'll find you one.

827
01:26:16,052 --> 01:26:17,720
A P.38, if possible.

828
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:21,974
I always liked them.

829
01:26:27,188 --> 01:26:29,440
What? A gun for Buisson?

830
01:26:30,441 --> 01:26:31,817
Are you mad, Borniche?

831
01:26:33,986 --> 01:26:36,822
Do you realize what you're asking for?

832
01:26:36,947 --> 01:26:38,616
A P.38,

833
01:26:38,741 --> 01:26:40,493
if possible.

834
01:26:42,161 --> 01:26:43,704
A P.38?

835
01:26:45,623 --> 01:26:47,416
He prefers them.

836
01:26:52,338 --> 01:26:55,925
What if we give him a Colt?
Will he throw a tantrum?

837
01:26:59,220 --> 01:27:02,390
You know what his temper is like.

838
01:27:02,515 --> 01:27:04,183
Listen, Borniche.

839
01:27:04,308 --> 01:27:06,936
This time you've crossed the line!

840
01:27:07,061 --> 01:27:10,690
You put yourself back
in charge of the Buisson case.

841
01:27:10,815 --> 01:27:13,484
You invented a ridiculous story!

842
01:27:13,609 --> 01:27:15,903
Excuse me, Chief.

843
01:27:16,028 --> 01:27:18,572
You told me to investigate
a corpse in the Ville d'Avray.

844
01:27:19,156 --> 01:27:21,325
Am I to blame
if it brought me back to Buisson?

845
01:27:21,450 --> 01:27:25,329
- You kept it to yourself.
- I wanted to be sure.

846
01:27:25,454 --> 01:27:27,331
That suited you.

847
01:27:27,456 --> 01:27:28,457
So,

848
01:27:28,582 --> 01:27:34,088
now we give Mr. Buisson
a vacation in a country hotel.

849
01:27:34,213 --> 01:27:39,051
And on top of that, you want
to give him a gun to shoot us with?

850
01:27:39,885 --> 01:27:41,262
Really.

851
01:27:41,887 --> 01:27:47,059
It's become a huge joke.

852
01:27:48,269 --> 01:27:50,062
I'll get Buisson a P.38.

853
01:27:50,187 --> 01:27:53,232
Where, Inspector?

854
01:27:53,357 --> 01:27:55,568
A souvenir of French commandos.

855
01:27:56,569 --> 01:27:59,655
If anything happens,
I'll have you locked up.

856
01:28:00,364 --> 01:28:02,074
Do you hear me?

857
01:28:02,825 --> 01:28:04,744
Very well, sir.

858
01:28:04,869 --> 01:28:06,704
My regards.

859
01:28:37,151 --> 01:28:38,527
Here.

860
01:29:44,343 --> 01:29:46,012
It wasn't easy.

861
01:29:54,437 --> 01:29:56,397
Just kidding.

862
01:29:59,859 --> 01:30:01,235
Your tax man?

863
01:30:03,821 --> 01:30:05,698
Jeannot is working on it.

864
01:30:07,992 --> 01:30:11,704
Tell him to hurry it up.
I'm bored to hell here.

865
01:30:11,829 --> 01:30:13,706
It's time I left France.

866
01:30:15,499 --> 01:30:16,876
Bring a paper?

867
01:30:28,346 --> 01:30:29,889
Damn.

868
01:30:30,473 --> 01:30:32,141
If the government
would get off my back,

869
01:30:32,266 --> 01:30:35,227
I'd give the jerks more
than a strike to worry about.

870
01:31:06,717 --> 01:31:08,761
- Is the chief out?
- Still in Lyon.

871
01:31:09,679 --> 01:31:12,014
He'll be back at noon.

872
01:31:12,139 --> 01:31:14,100
We'll have to go on without him.

873
01:31:14,225 --> 01:31:16,769
Impossible, he'll be mad.

874
01:31:16,894 --> 01:31:18,646
So he'll be mad.

875
01:31:18,771 --> 01:31:21,148
- It's now or never.
- Just a minute.

876
01:31:21,273 --> 01:31:24,033
- Did you warn the local precinct?
- No. If Buisson suspects anything,

877
01:31:24,110 --> 01:31:26,404
we won't get him alive.

878
01:31:26,529 --> 01:31:29,657
Moreover, Roubier says
he always carries a grenade

879
01:31:29,782 --> 01:31:31,659
to blow himself up if necessary.

880
01:31:31,784 --> 01:31:34,829
You're insane. We're taking a huge risk,
and we're not even covered.

881
01:31:34,954 --> 01:31:38,833
It's a rule to warn the precinct
and the chief.

882
01:31:38,958 --> 01:31:41,544
Aren't we in the service?

883
01:31:42,628 --> 01:31:44,839
I'm not forcing you to come.

884
01:31:57,810 --> 01:31:59,687
- Alfonse.
- Inspector?

885
01:32:00,438 --> 01:32:02,648
- Put that on the chief's desk.
- Right away.

886
01:32:05,276 --> 01:32:08,696
- Asked for a car?
- A special one is waiting.

887
01:32:54,617 --> 01:32:56,160
You all right?

888
01:33:16,180 --> 01:33:17,890
Fill her up, please.

889
01:33:18,974 --> 01:33:21,185
Roger, the other side.

890
01:34:15,865 --> 01:34:19,160
- Can we eat here?
- Yes, sir. We have a restaurant.

891
01:34:19,285 --> 01:34:20,661
Great!

892
01:34:22,246 --> 01:34:23,748
We'll lunch here.

893
01:34:23,873 --> 01:34:26,250
We can be at the clinic at 4:00.

894
01:34:31,005 --> 01:34:33,257
- May I park here?
- Of course, sir.

895
01:35:32,942 --> 01:35:36,570
"Lunching with Buisson at the hotel.

896
01:35:37,363 --> 01:35:42,034
Come for coffee.
Respectfully, Borniche."

897
01:35:42,785 --> 01:35:44,328
Good God!

898
01:36:11,731 --> 01:36:13,274
What's he doing?

899
01:36:13,983 --> 01:36:15,526
Looking at the car.

900
01:36:15,651 --> 01:36:18,571
He can take it.
I have a plug.

901
01:36:21,949 --> 01:36:23,159
You all right?

902
01:36:23,284 --> 01:36:25,494
Going crazy, but I'm fine.

903
01:36:31,125 --> 01:36:33,336
The table is ready.

904
01:36:36,088 --> 01:36:38,341
- Take your pick.
- Over there.

905
01:36:40,760 --> 01:36:42,303
Here are the menus.

906
01:36:42,845 --> 01:36:44,889
I recommend the chicken, a specialty.

907
01:36:45,014 --> 01:36:47,558
The chicken will be great.
Bring hors d'oeuvres first.

908
01:36:47,683 --> 01:36:50,686
- For me too.
- No, thanks.

909
01:36:50,811 --> 01:36:53,856
I'll bring the hors d'oeuvres
and a bottle of the local wine.

910
01:36:53,981 --> 01:36:55,524
Yeah, thanks.

911
01:37:13,959 --> 01:37:16,671
"Music: Soothes the savage beast."

912
01:38:15,104 --> 01:38:16,480
You play well.

913
01:38:18,607 --> 01:38:21,277
Little things, not Chopin.

914
01:38:22,528 --> 01:38:24,363
I like things like that better.

915
01:38:26,824 --> 01:38:28,409
Know any other Edith Piaf?

916
01:38:58,439 --> 01:38:59,940
Here you are.

917
01:39:01,567 --> 01:39:03,444
Have you decided, sir?

918
01:39:04,153 --> 01:39:05,696
Chicken.

919
01:39:07,281 --> 01:39:09,867
Come and eat, Catherine.
We're late.

920
01:39:14,372 --> 01:39:15,873
Thank you, miss.

921
01:39:21,879 --> 01:39:23,422
Excuse us, sir.

922
01:39:35,601 --> 01:39:37,978
You're not giving him a concert.

923
01:39:39,772 --> 01:39:41,649
He's got nice eyes.

924
01:39:44,819 --> 01:39:48,114
He's about to move in, Roger.

925
01:39:48,239 --> 01:39:49,949
Go ahead, laugh.

926
01:39:50,074 --> 01:39:51,951
May I eat, ma'am?

927
01:39:56,122 --> 01:39:58,833
- He's coming back.
- Eat and don't turn around.

928
01:40:07,508 --> 01:40:10,636
I think Le Caporal Epinglé
should have won the Goncourt.

929
01:40:11,345 --> 01:40:12,888
Read it?

930
01:40:15,516 --> 01:40:17,309
Not much time to read

931
01:40:17,435 --> 01:40:20,146
with all these strikes.

932
01:40:20,271 --> 01:40:23,524
Literary awards
are fixed by publishers.

933
01:40:23,649 --> 01:40:25,109
How about some wine?

934
01:40:32,408 --> 01:40:34,410
Excuse me, I forgot.

935
01:40:45,588 --> 01:40:47,131
Excuse me.

936
01:40:53,971 --> 01:40:56,015
Better call the clinic.

937
01:40:57,475 --> 01:40:59,018
Yes, perhaps.

938
01:41:00,227 --> 01:41:05,316
- Can we call Rambouillet?
- Of course. What number?

939
01:41:05,441 --> 01:41:08,402
- 432.
- 432 Rambouillet.

940
01:41:28,881 --> 01:41:31,842
Hello, miss.
Mother Goose Inn here.

941
01:41:31,967 --> 01:41:34,887
Rambouillet 432, please.

942
01:41:41,894 --> 01:41:43,979
Hope you enjoy it.

943
01:41:49,068 --> 01:41:50,444
Really?

944
01:41:51,112 --> 01:41:52,488
Hold on a minute.

945
01:41:52,613 --> 01:41:54,782
That number doesn't exist.

946
01:41:59,245 --> 01:42:00,621
What?

947
01:42:04,375 --> 01:42:06,585
It's the Ambroise Paré Clinic.

948
01:42:06,711 --> 01:42:08,045
Wait.

949
01:42:08,170 --> 01:42:10,506
Is this the Ambroise Paré Clinic?

950
01:42:10,631 --> 01:42:13,467
- She make a mistake?
- Ambroise Paré?

951
01:42:14,218 --> 01:42:15,886
Mrs. Mercier?

952
01:42:17,304 --> 01:42:18,848
Dr. Le Garrec here.

953
01:42:22,184 --> 01:42:24,270
We're a little late.

954
01:42:25,938 --> 01:42:28,482
Tell the boss I'll be there at 4:00.

955
01:42:30,443 --> 01:42:32,319
We're on our way.

956
01:42:33,529 --> 01:42:34,905
Yes.

957
01:42:35,656 --> 01:42:37,366
Fine, Mrs. Mercier.

958
01:42:37,950 --> 01:42:39,452
See you later.

959
01:42:47,084 --> 01:42:49,628
- How's the chicken coming?
- It's coming up.

960
01:42:49,754 --> 01:42:51,964
Taste it.
It's her specialty.

961
01:42:52,089 --> 01:42:54,842
- Some bread, please.
- Oh, yeah. Coming.

962
01:42:59,221 --> 01:43:01,223
Excuse me, my wife forgot.

963
01:43:01,349 --> 01:43:03,225
- Everything all right'?
- Great.

964
01:43:14,862 --> 01:43:16,530
It's over, Emile!

965
01:43:18,616 --> 01:43:19,992
The grenade! Good God!

966
01:44:13,629 --> 01:44:16,549
What followed is routine police work.

967
01:44:17,299 --> 01:44:19,260
Buisson imprisoned in the Santé.

968
01:44:19,385 --> 01:44:23,514
I questioned him before
a special commission.

969
01:44:24,098 --> 01:44:27,852
Twice a week,
I picked him up in a station car,

970
01:44:27,977 --> 01:44:30,354
early in the morning.

971
01:44:32,440 --> 01:44:34,817
- Morning, Mr. Borniche.
- Hi, Emile.

972
01:44:35,901 --> 01:44:38,362
Little by little,
certainly not on purpose,

973
01:44:38,487 --> 01:44:41,657
something strange
happened between us.

974
01:44:42,241 --> 01:44:46,537
Friendship would be a big word,
but we became pals.

975
01:44:47,288 --> 01:44:49,123
We nearly understood one another,

976
01:44:49,248 --> 01:44:52,001
especially when talking
about the weather.

977
01:45:44,887 --> 01:45:47,473
- Come back for him at 6:00.
- Very well.

978
01:46:13,833 --> 01:46:16,252
So Emile would sit down.

979
01:46:17,128 --> 01:46:20,006
With his free hand,
he'd pour himself a glass of Bordeaux.

980
01:46:20,715 --> 01:46:23,134
I bought him a bottle of it.

981
01:46:31,350 --> 01:46:36,856
He'd take out his thick glasses
and read the Figaro on the table.

982
01:46:51,579 --> 01:46:52,913
It was 11:00.

983
01:46:53,039 --> 01:46:55,458
I wouldn't question him till 12:30.

984
01:46:57,877 --> 01:47:01,005
I'd go over the reports.
A moment of peace.

985
01:47:01,672 --> 01:47:04,258
Emile, just the news.

986
01:47:11,974 --> 01:47:15,061
Why do you always
read the Figaro?

987
01:47:15,186 --> 01:47:16,896
Habit.

988
01:47:17,480 --> 01:47:21,025
On the run, no one suspects a guy
reading the Figaro. It's too serious.

989
01:47:21,150 --> 01:47:24,236
At 2:00, serious work begins.

990
01:47:24,612 --> 01:47:28,991
The stack of files on Mr. Emile
were almost five feet high.

991
01:47:29,742 --> 01:47:32,370
He was charged with
36 murders and holdups.

992
01:47:32,495 --> 01:47:34,038
They threw the book at him.

993
01:47:34,163 --> 01:47:37,917
But I had to go through all of it
to separate truth from falsehood.

994
01:47:38,668 --> 01:47:41,671
Emile confessed to everything
except for the killings.

995
01:47:41,796 --> 01:47:44,465
But I had condemning evidence,

996
01:47:44,590 --> 01:47:46,258
unshakable witnesses,

997
01:47:46,384 --> 01:47:50,554
and the P.38 business
weighed heavily against him.

998
01:47:58,896 --> 01:48:00,272
Shall we start?

999
01:48:01,691 --> 01:48:03,567
Let's start, Mr. Borniche.

1000
01:48:08,447 --> 01:48:10,658
Our meetings went on for over a year.

1001
01:48:11,742 --> 01:48:15,037
Only once did the real Buisson show.

1002
01:48:15,913 --> 01:48:20,042
The day we talked about Paul Roubier,
Paulo the Bomber.

1003
01:48:28,801 --> 01:48:30,886
That guy, Mr. Borniche,

1004
01:48:32,930 --> 01:48:35,683
I'd like to take a handsaw
to his throat...

1005
01:48:39,186 --> 01:48:41,814
and stop from time to time
to hear him scream.

1006
01:48:52,491 --> 01:48:54,452
I'm afraid you won't get the chance.

1007
01:48:55,828 --> 01:48:57,204
Yeah.

1008
01:49:07,548 --> 01:49:09,133
Too bad.

1009
01:49:16,849 --> 01:49:20,770
I sat in silence watching Buisson,

1010
01:49:21,145 --> 01:49:25,066
motionless in his chair,
his right arm hanging in the cuffs.

1011
01:49:27,902 --> 01:49:32,406
I thought to myself,
"Emile has guts."

1012
01:49:56,013 --> 01:49:58,641
Condemned to death
by the Seine High Court,

1013
01:49:58,808 --> 01:50:02,395
Emile Buisson was executed
on February 28, 1956.
