1
00:00:30,503 --> 00:00:32,835
<i>The name's Roger Borniche, </i>

2
00:00:33,673 --> 00:00:35,538
<i>inspector with the Federal Police. </i>

3
00:00:35,642 --> 00:00:37,132
<i>I'm a cop. </i>

4
00:00:37,244 --> 00:00:39,542
<i>I love this goddamn profession. </i>

5
00:00:39,646 --> 00:00:42,274
<i>But this morning, I'd rather
have stayed in bed with Catherine. </i>

6
00:00:42,816 --> 00:00:47,753
<i>She wants to get married,
make it legal. </i>

7
00:00:48,455 --> 00:00:50,650
<i>But I've got to become
chief investigator first. </i>

8
00:00:51,191 --> 00:00:52,920
<i>I'm already doing thejob. </i>

9
00:00:53,627 --> 00:00:55,094
<i>I'm only lacking the title... </i>

10
00:00:55,195 --> 00:00:56,822
<i>and the salary... </i>

11
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:00,988
<i>I've solved some major cases
since I've been in this joint. </i>

12
00:01:01,101 --> 00:01:02,568
<i>The boss can't deny that. </i>

13
00:01:05,305 --> 00:01:07,102
<i>But that particular morning, </i>

14
00:01:07,207 --> 00:01:09,334
<i>I had no idea what was about to pop up. </i>

15
00:01:11,911 --> 00:01:12,878
Hi, Borniche.

16
00:01:16,249 --> 00:01:17,716
Morning, Roger.

17
00:01:21,421 --> 00:01:22,388
Well?

18
00:01:23,223 --> 00:01:24,690
Well, nothing.

19
00:01:26,893 --> 00:01:28,520
He's talking nonsense.

20
00:01:32,565 --> 00:01:34,226
Leave me alone with him.

21
00:01:42,609 --> 00:01:44,907
If you're so smart...

22
00:02:12,305 --> 00:02:14,364
I'd like to believe you, Raymond.

23
00:02:15,075 --> 00:02:16,770
I always tell the truth.

24
00:02:17,711 --> 00:02:20,407
So the day of the shooting,
the 17 th, you weren't in Paris.

25
00:02:20,513 --> 00:02:21,980
You were in Rouen.

26
00:02:22,082 --> 00:02:24,949
At my brother-in-law's.
He'll confirm it.

27
00:02:25,485 --> 00:02:28,818
They say they saw me in my bar,
but they were outside.

28
00:02:28,922 --> 00:02:31,220
They're obviously wrong.

29
00:02:31,858 --> 00:02:34,554
Or they want you to do wrong.
I don't doubt it.

30
00:02:34,661 --> 00:02:38,119
Then why did your pals beat me up?

31
00:02:39,165 --> 00:02:40,792
They're impulsive.

32
00:02:41,668 --> 00:02:43,636
You too, sometimes.

33
00:02:43,737 --> 00:02:48,538
Not on the 17 th,
but on the 16th, 20th or 22nd.

34
00:02:49,776 --> 00:02:51,641
All right.

35
00:02:51,745 --> 00:02:54,680
I'm magnanimous.
I'll release you.

36
00:02:57,617 --> 00:03:01,144
- What for?
- You give Lieutenant Clot information.

37
00:03:01,654 --> 00:03:03,986
Why not let me have it first?

38
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,888
But I'm not an informer!

39
00:03:07,761 --> 00:03:10,059
I could name some of the guys
you've brought down.

40
00:03:10,163 --> 00:03:13,564
Scumbags who worked for the Gestapo.

41
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:15,133
That's different.

42
00:03:15,835 --> 00:03:18,463
You should've been decorated.

43
00:03:27,313 --> 00:03:28,940
Right. I'll be right there.

44
00:03:29,983 --> 00:03:32,611
Make up your mind.
I'm going to see the boss.

45
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,315
That'll give you some time
to think it over.

46
00:03:43,363 --> 00:03:45,991
- Keep an eye on that guy.
- Sure, Roger.

47
00:03:56,609 --> 00:03:57,576
<i>Come in. </i>

48
00:04:05,852 --> 00:04:07,114
Buisson has escaped.

49
00:04:07,754 --> 00:04:10,917
Buisson?
Never heard of him.

50
00:04:11,024 --> 00:04:15,586
You weren't here
when he earned his stripes.

51
00:04:15,695 --> 00:04:17,492
Fine list of holdups.

52
00:04:17,597 --> 00:04:19,963
The Troyees Bank before the war.

53
00:04:20,066 --> 00:04:24,594
In '42, the Victory Street holdup,
a cashier shot.

54
00:04:29,309 --> 00:04:33,040
I want you to get Buisson
before Central does.

55
00:04:33,913 --> 00:04:37,212
We'll show Clot
that the Federal Police exist,

56
00:04:37,317 --> 00:04:39,945
that Central doesn't have
a monopoly on criminal cases.

57
00:04:40,053 --> 00:04:45,116
Careful.
Mr. Emile shoots fast and straight.

58
00:04:45,225 --> 00:04:47,250
Does that appeal to you?

59
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,521
If not, I'd be a salesman.

60
00:04:50,263 --> 00:04:52,060
Go on, get your informers competing.

61
00:04:52,165 --> 00:04:54,633
By the way,
I'd like to release Pelletier.

62
00:04:54,734 --> 00:04:57,225
That's going too far.

63
00:04:57,337 --> 00:05:00,306
The Spaniard was shot
coming out of his bar.

64
00:05:00,406 --> 00:05:03,068
His Rouen alibi will hold.

65
00:05:03,176 --> 00:05:05,736
I think he has a deal with Clot.

66
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:07,906
How about we cut in?

67
00:05:08,014 --> 00:05:11,313
That's what I like to hear.

68
00:05:11,417 --> 00:05:13,885
- It's up to you.
- I know.

69
00:05:13,987 --> 00:05:17,718
Make Buisson a priority.
Get his file from the archives.

70
00:05:18,258 --> 00:05:20,021
If you pull this off,

71
00:05:20,126 --> 00:05:22,594
I promise you'll make
chief investigator this time.

72
00:05:31,471 --> 00:05:32,768
Say, guys.

73
00:05:32,872 --> 00:05:34,772
The name Buisson
mean anything to you?

74
00:05:35,241 --> 00:05:37,266
The gangster who
broke out of Villejuif?

75
00:05:38,044 --> 00:05:39,909
The chief wants us to get him.

76
00:05:43,116 --> 00:05:44,879
Archives, please.

77
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,479
- What about Raymond?
- We let him go.

78
00:05:49,689 --> 00:05:51,156
Speaking of which,

79
00:05:51,925 --> 00:05:54,223
I don't much like your methods.

80
00:05:54,327 --> 00:05:56,295
Want me to offer him a candy bar?

81
00:05:58,498 --> 00:06:00,125
That's an idea.

82
00:06:01,267 --> 00:06:04,293
Roblin? Borniche here.

83
00:06:04,404 --> 00:06:06,838
Could I have Buisson's file?

84
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,474
Emile Buisson.

85
00:06:10,176 --> 00:06:12,041
Thanks, I'll send Darros.

86
00:06:20,587 --> 00:06:22,214
So, it's a deal.

87
00:06:23,122 --> 00:06:24,248
A deal?

88
00:06:24,357 --> 00:06:26,154
I didn't agree to anything.

89
00:06:26,859 --> 00:06:28,656
If you don't agree,

90
00:06:29,596 --> 00:06:32,724
I'll make sure it gets around
that you inform for Clot.

91
00:06:35,401 --> 00:06:37,528
You must take me for a bitch.

92
00:06:39,472 --> 00:06:41,770
That's why I'm giving you
my phone number.

93
00:06:42,542 --> 00:06:43,975
I'm a pervert.

94
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,977
I love bitches.

95
00:06:46,746 --> 00:06:48,179
Anvers.

96
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,558
My bar, can I open it?

97
00:07:03,663 --> 00:07:05,130
Of course.

98
00:07:05,832 --> 00:07:09,461
If a certain Buisson ever stops by
for a drink, give me a call.

99
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:12,595
Buisson? Are you crazy?

100
00:07:13,406 --> 00:07:14,805
You know him?

101
00:07:16,676 --> 00:07:18,906
Seen him around,
like lots of others.

102
00:07:21,381 --> 00:07:22,848
Thought he was still in the can.

103
00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:26,248
He got out
on good behavior.

104
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,548
My brother, Emile.
This is Suzanne.

105
00:08:35,254 --> 00:08:36,721
René's sister.

106
00:08:37,657 --> 00:08:39,648
She was Pete the Saint's girl.

107
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:42,057
Cops shot him
during the Marseilles holdup.

108
00:08:42,161 --> 00:08:43,526
I know.

109
00:08:43,629 --> 00:08:45,654
We'll stay here for a while.

110
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,863
In any case, I can't go home.
The cops must be there.

111
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:53,336
They'll check the files.

112
00:08:53,439 --> 00:08:55,236
- The driver?
- Mario the Wop?

113
00:08:55,341 --> 00:08:58,401
He's dumping the car.
Don't worry. He's solid.

114
00:09:16,295 --> 00:09:19,696
When Mario comes back,
have him find another.

115
00:09:28,241 --> 00:09:29,799
Do we need one just yet?

116
00:09:44,824 --> 00:09:47,884
Suzanne, no errands to run?

117
00:09:55,401 --> 00:09:58,029
Bring back the evening paper.

118
00:10:19,492 --> 00:10:21,687
Got a change of clothes?

119
00:10:21,794 --> 00:10:24,024
I want to go dancing this afternoon.

120
00:10:25,064 --> 00:10:27,328
Can't that wait?

121
00:10:27,433 --> 00:10:29,367
I hate to keep squealers waiting.

122
00:10:29,468 --> 00:10:30,696
Cheers.

123
00:11:29,328 --> 00:11:30,625
Hello, baby cop.

124
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:32,197
Hello, big girl.

125
00:11:33,566 --> 00:11:35,033
A good day?

126
00:11:35,134 --> 00:11:36,465
Hectic.

127
00:11:36,569 --> 00:11:40,027
Bernier was out.
I had to answer the phone.

128
00:11:40,907 --> 00:11:42,704
A long wait for the bus.

129
00:11:42,808 --> 00:11:44,673
No waiting on the subway.

130
00:11:45,244 --> 00:11:47,303
Roger, I have the car for Sunday.

131
00:11:48,347 --> 00:11:50,338
The Talbot? Fantastic.

132
00:11:52,318 --> 00:11:55,617
I saw father at noon.
He gave in.

133
00:11:56,322 --> 00:11:58,415
It's hard to resist you.

134
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:01,923
If you'd been my daughter,
I would've made a very bad father.

135
00:12:02,962 --> 00:12:04,554
What are we doing tonight?

136
00:12:04,664 --> 00:12:08,657
Nothing. I've got to read
these files for tomorrow.

137
00:12:09,201 --> 00:12:10,793
Excuse me.

138
00:12:16,342 --> 00:12:18,367
<i>Devil in the Flesh is playing.</i>

139
00:12:20,746 --> 00:12:22,213
You promised we'd see it.

140
00:12:24,283 --> 00:12:26,444
We'll go next week.
It'll play for a while.

141
00:12:31,991 --> 00:12:34,255
Why don't you change careers?

142
00:12:34,961 --> 00:12:37,589
Your attorney boss needs clients.

143
00:12:41,834 --> 00:12:43,859
This the guy who escaped?

144
00:12:44,403 --> 00:12:46,894
Yes, that's him.

145
00:12:47,606 --> 00:12:49,073
He crazy?

146
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:54,568
He acts like it 'cause it's easier
to get out of madhouses than prisons.

147
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,409
Is he dangerous?

148
00:12:56,515 --> 00:12:57,982
Very.

149
00:12:59,518 --> 00:13:01,509
Probably because of his
unhappy childhood.

150
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,282
His alcoholic father
made him steal food for them.

151
00:13:04,991 --> 00:13:07,152
That doesn't make for a saint.

152
00:13:10,496 --> 00:13:12,657
He's at the point of no return.

153
00:13:12,765 --> 00:13:14,995
All we can do for him

154
00:13:15,101 --> 00:13:18,127
is keep him from killing
to save his neck.

155
00:13:18,237 --> 00:13:20,569
You should've been an attorney.

156
00:13:20,673 --> 00:13:21,833
Maybe.

157
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,247
Borniche, Federal Police.

158
00:13:30,116 --> 00:13:32,846
- Jean-Baptiste Buisson's file, please.
- Emile's brother?

159
00:13:32,952 --> 00:13:34,852
Everyone wants that one today.

160
00:13:37,056 --> 00:13:38,523
First row.

161
00:14:27,973 --> 00:14:29,440
May I help you, gentlemen?

162
00:14:29,542 --> 00:14:31,169
Hands up.

163
00:14:32,878 --> 00:14:34,778
Everyone up!

164
00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:38,617
Come on, hands up!

165
00:14:48,294 --> 00:14:49,761
Bastards!

166
00:14:52,498 --> 00:14:54,728
Put the dough on the table.

167
00:14:54,834 --> 00:14:56,665
Jewels, lighters, everything.

168
00:14:57,203 --> 00:14:58,465
Quick!

169
00:15:11,484 --> 00:15:12,451
Come on.

170
00:15:13,552 --> 00:15:15,110
Earrings.

171
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:35,266
The ring.

172
00:15:37,309 --> 00:15:38,469
Now!

173
00:15:49,822 --> 00:15:51,449
Don't move!

174
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,761
The cops.

175
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:00,058
- You okay?
- Yes, fine. Get moving.

176
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,387
Be careful, they shot at me.

177
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:16,868
Stop!

178
00:18:04,923 --> 00:18:06,550
Mado, open up.

179
00:18:19,271 --> 00:18:20,738
Is your man here?

180
00:18:26,178 --> 00:18:29,306
- What's the matter?
- We need to stay a minute.

181
00:18:29,415 --> 00:18:31,042
It's stormy outside.

182
00:18:35,854 --> 00:18:37,321
Good to see you, Raymond.

183
00:18:40,592 --> 00:18:42,059
I'll be damned!

184
00:18:43,562 --> 00:18:45,826
I wasn't expecting...

185
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,266
Can I wash up?

186
00:18:48,367 --> 00:18:50,597
Go right ahead.
There's water at the bar.

187
00:18:56,241 --> 00:18:58,675
We'll go to the back room.

188
00:19:10,255 --> 00:19:12,587
You haven't changed in five years.

189
00:19:28,574 --> 00:19:30,201
That's a load.

190
00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:33,676
Grandma's inheritance.
We want top price.

191
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,349
All right.
I'll see the Armenian tomorrow.

192
00:19:37,449 --> 00:19:39,110
You know his terms?

193
00:19:40,486 --> 00:19:43,182
You'll get your cut,
but be quick.

194
00:19:44,056 --> 00:19:46,024
Thursday good?

195
00:19:46,725 --> 00:19:48,022
Deal.

196
00:19:48,127 --> 00:19:49,958
- 4:00.
- Fine.

197
00:19:50,562 --> 00:19:53,030
Mado, bring us a bottle.

198
00:19:58,971 --> 00:20:02,372
"Officer Schmitt Dies
as Result of Injuries."

199
00:20:02,474 --> 00:20:04,442
That's pure Buisson.

200
00:20:05,811 --> 00:20:07,301
Description fits.

201
00:20:07,413 --> 00:20:08,880
That's his style.

202
00:20:08,981 --> 00:20:12,212
The guy escapes,
forms a new team,

203
00:20:12,317 --> 00:20:14,148
and he's back in business.

204
00:20:14,686 --> 00:20:16,153
He doesn't waste any time.

205
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,722
Unlike you.

206
00:20:17,823 --> 00:20:19,586
You're not getting anywhere.

207
00:20:19,691 --> 00:20:21,886
How can I get him in a week?

208
00:20:21,994 --> 00:20:25,486
- The press says you're a super cop.
- I could do without the press.

209
00:20:25,597 --> 00:20:28,395
Listen up.
Just get moving.

210
00:20:29,301 --> 00:20:31,735
Central will spare no effort.

211
00:20:32,271 --> 00:20:34,068
What exactly are you doing?

212
00:20:36,074 --> 00:20:38,668
Aside from smoking
one cigarette after another?

213
00:20:40,045 --> 00:20:41,512
Watching his brother's place.

214
00:20:41,613 --> 00:20:45,413
Central's guys are there already.
Find something else.

215
00:20:45,517 --> 00:20:47,815
I'm looking, Chief.

216
00:20:53,692 --> 00:20:55,819
Phone. Raymond Pelletier.

217
00:20:55,928 --> 00:20:57,395
Will only talk to you.

218
00:21:07,639 --> 00:21:09,266
Inspector?

219
00:21:11,577 --> 00:21:13,044
It's about your friend.

220
00:21:13,145 --> 00:21:14,840
What friend?

221
00:21:15,948 --> 00:21:18,075
The one who's out
on good behavior.

222
00:21:19,351 --> 00:21:21,251
Oh, I get you. Well?

223
00:21:22,788 --> 00:21:26,849
A man will come to my bar
at 4:00 on Thursday.

224
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:29,186
Just follow him,

225
00:21:30,062 --> 00:21:32,326
and he'll lead you to the right place.

226
00:21:34,199 --> 00:21:36,827
Fine. Thanks.

227
00:22:11,136 --> 00:22:12,763
There he goes.

228
00:22:13,639 --> 00:22:15,197
Let's go.

229
00:22:50,042 --> 00:22:51,509
We've met.

230
00:22:52,377 --> 00:22:54,345
- Where do you live?
- Paris.

231
00:22:55,714 --> 00:22:57,477
That's where I've seen you.

232
00:25:16,822 --> 00:25:18,653
DÉSI RÉE STREET

233
00:25:25,864 --> 00:25:27,456
May I use the phone?

234
00:25:27,566 --> 00:25:29,329
Give me a coffee.

235
00:25:37,476 --> 00:25:40,036
In Marseilles.

236
00:25:40,912 --> 00:25:43,039
With my uncle.

237
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:00,990
Hidoine just called.
Join him with the chief.

238
00:26:01,099 --> 00:26:02,726
Here's the address.

239
00:26:16,848 --> 00:26:19,646
I hope he'll confirm that.

240
00:26:19,751 --> 00:26:22,549
If not, we'll have to
have a little talk.

241
00:26:41,973 --> 00:26:43,600
- He's here.
- Where?

242
00:26:44,643 --> 00:26:47,134
You watch Désirée Street,
first on the left.

243
00:26:54,586 --> 00:26:57,054
I followed Jean-Baptiste Buisson here.

244
00:26:57,155 --> 00:26:59,089
He went into the building
at 8, Désirée Street.

245
00:26:59,958 --> 00:27:01,755
I'll stay with Hidoine and Darros.

246
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:04,294
When we know exactly
where they live, I'll arrest them.

247
00:27:04,396 --> 00:27:06,023
By yourself, Dick Tracy?

248
00:27:06,131 --> 00:27:07,996
The local precinct will help.

249
00:27:08,834 --> 00:27:09,960
Got it.

250
00:27:10,068 --> 00:27:14,528
But if you lose Buisson,
I'll send you south after chicken thieves.

251
00:27:15,073 --> 00:27:16,540
I know.

252
00:27:38,797 --> 00:27:41,163
Robert, here's some food.

253
00:27:42,367 --> 00:27:44,392
A beer, the other's for Darros.

254
00:27:45,103 --> 00:27:46,730
Go easy on it.

255
00:27:55,347 --> 00:27:56,814
Get lost!

256
00:28:01,753 --> 00:28:03,846
- Here. Dying of hunger?
- Just about.

257
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,694
Leave a little beer for me.

258
00:28:14,065 --> 00:28:15,123
Now what?

259
00:28:15,667 --> 00:28:17,464
It's too early to move in.

260
00:28:23,608 --> 00:28:25,576
What about those guys?

261
00:28:25,677 --> 00:28:28,305
Do they wait for dawn
to kill everyone?

262
00:29:57,469 --> 00:29:58,436
Goddamn!

263
00:29:59,204 --> 00:30:01,172
Hey, the cops!

264
00:30:01,272 --> 00:30:03,103
Cut the crap.

265
00:30:03,208 --> 00:30:04,539
Get up!

266
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:07,401
Emile, the cops! Quick!

267
00:30:14,352 --> 00:30:16,286
They tipped us off.

268
00:30:16,955 --> 00:30:19,082
Go upstairs and get out
by the roof. Hurry.

269
00:30:34,539 --> 00:30:36,006
I'll see if it's clear.

270
00:30:50,522 --> 00:30:51,989
Quick, get out!

271
00:30:54,292 --> 00:30:56,283
Stop! Police!

272
00:31:27,392 --> 00:31:28,859
Goddamn!

273
00:31:53,685 --> 00:31:55,152
The ambulance is coming.

274
00:32:08,466 --> 00:32:10,434
- Hello, Germaine.
- Morning, Chief.

275
00:32:16,508 --> 00:32:17,475
Hey, Borniche.

276
00:32:17,575 --> 00:32:20,601
For a former paratrooper,
you're not much of a jumper.

277
00:32:20,712 --> 00:32:21,679
Chief, please.

278
00:32:21,779 --> 00:32:25,772
If you'd pulled it off,
this mess with Central wouldn't matter.

279
00:32:25,884 --> 00:32:29,411
Clot claims he'd laid a trap for Buisson
and that we fouled it up.

280
00:32:29,521 --> 00:32:31,386
- Clot can go and...
- But in the mean time,

281
00:32:31,489 --> 00:32:33,548
we're in it up to our neck.

282
00:32:33,658 --> 00:32:35,683
Chief, we have Buisson's
brother and accomplice.

283
00:32:36,895 --> 00:32:38,362
- What is it?
- Still nothing.

284
00:32:38,463 --> 00:32:41,398
We're searching the area
room by room.

285
00:32:42,433 --> 00:32:43,525
That's it.

286
00:32:43,635 --> 00:32:46,365
- See? Still nothing.
- So?

287
00:32:46,471 --> 00:32:48,735
The brother will need
a month in the hospital.

288
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,968
- And the girl?
- She won't talk. She's a real lioness.

289
00:32:52,677 --> 00:32:55,305
I have a meeting
with the director at 2:00.

290
00:32:55,413 --> 00:32:57,313
You know what that means?

291
00:33:00,351 --> 00:33:02,945
Give me a detailed report.

292
00:33:14,299 --> 00:33:15,766
Who's calling?

293
00:33:16,301 --> 00:33:17,393
Catherine.

294
00:33:24,475 --> 00:33:26,807
I'm fine. Who told you that?

295
00:33:27,412 --> 00:33:28,709
A pack of lies!

296
00:33:28,813 --> 00:33:31,509
Roger, why are you
talking to me like that?

297
00:33:33,251 --> 00:33:35,242
I know. I'm sorry...

298
00:33:35,353 --> 00:33:36,820
Forgive me.

299
00:33:37,355 --> 00:33:40,222
Really, I can't tell you.

300
00:33:41,426 --> 00:33:43,189
I'll try to get free.

301
00:33:46,397 --> 00:33:47,921
I'll do my best.

302
00:33:48,466 --> 00:33:49,933
That's it.

303
00:33:50,635 --> 00:33:52,535
I'll call this evening.

304
00:33:53,638 --> 00:33:54,764
Yes.

305
00:33:56,207 --> 00:33:58,004
Yeah, love you too.

306
00:34:14,125 --> 00:34:16,719
But you don't understand.

307
00:34:16,828 --> 00:34:19,797
Three or four days
while I get him a room.

308
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,658
Thanks.

309
00:34:30,208 --> 00:34:34,167
I've found a room in the suburbs.

310
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:35,846
An old friend.

311
00:34:35,947 --> 00:34:38,381
When you see the Wop,
give him the address.

312
00:34:38,483 --> 00:34:41,247
Tell him to bring a Colt.45.

313
00:34:41,352 --> 00:34:42,444
Okay.

314
00:34:47,158 --> 00:34:50,127
My God. You've had it, Bollec.

315
00:34:51,095 --> 00:34:54,223
I'll see you guillotined
together with the Buissons.

316
00:35:21,626 --> 00:35:23,753
I'll bust your balls.

317
00:35:23,861 --> 00:35:26,455
You'll never use them again, you swine.

318
00:35:26,564 --> 00:35:28,031
Never again!

319
00:35:31,636 --> 00:35:34,833
So that wasn't Emile Buisson with you?

320
00:35:35,373 --> 00:35:38,308
It was...
What was his name?

321
00:35:38,843 --> 00:35:40,572
Repeat your bullshit.

322
00:35:40,678 --> 00:35:42,475
Repeat it!

323
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,377
George Muller!

324
00:35:45,616 --> 00:35:47,413
That's the name I knew him by.

325
00:35:49,487 --> 00:35:52,786
I'll make you eat your own shit,
you bastard,

326
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:55,188
if you go on taking me for a jerk!

327
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:01,130
You're not in the slammer yet, buddy.

328
00:36:03,501 --> 00:36:06,959
He says the guy on the roof
wasn't Buisson.

329
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,034
Interesting.

330
00:36:12,577 --> 00:36:16,013
We'll see if your statement
matches your sister's.

331
00:36:16,714 --> 00:36:18,545
Then we'll have a talk.

332
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,020
You got a minute, Lucien?

333
00:36:36,868 --> 00:36:38,335
Now what is it?

334
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:39,837
You know.

335
00:36:40,938 --> 00:36:43,168
Want me to give gifts
to a guy who kills a cop?

336
00:36:43,708 --> 00:36:45,573
Maybe it wasn't him.

337
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:48,010
You can do your job without that.

338
00:36:51,048 --> 00:36:53,346
Roger, you're starting
to get on our nerves.

339
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:58,514
You act important,
but you're not the boss.

340
00:37:00,725 --> 00:37:02,625
Guys like that are vermin.

341
00:37:03,161 --> 00:37:05,129
And vermin are for squashing, get it?

342
00:37:07,999 --> 00:37:11,594
If it had been your brother
or father that got gunned down,

343
00:37:11,702 --> 00:37:13,169
maybe you'd see it differently.

344
00:37:15,273 --> 00:37:17,400
- You think?
- Yes, I'm sure.

345
00:37:21,279 --> 00:37:24,248
Deep down,
you're nothing but an amateur.

346
00:37:30,955 --> 00:37:33,082
Let me tell you a story, Lucien.

347
00:37:33,191 --> 00:37:35,216
A story I never tell.

348
00:37:37,261 --> 00:37:39,058
Suppose I had a brother.

349
00:37:40,164 --> 00:37:42,064
A guy I loved a lot.

350
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,901
In '44, the Lauriston Street
Gestapo got him.

351
00:37:46,437 --> 00:37:48,132
You catch my drift?

352
00:37:49,006 --> 00:37:51,600
They were so "nice" to him
that he died.

353
00:37:51,709 --> 00:37:52,869
Don't mix things up.

354
00:37:55,746 --> 00:37:57,737
I didn't join the force for that.

355
00:37:58,282 --> 00:38:01,012
When I joined up,
I knew I might be killed.

356
00:38:01,552 --> 00:38:04,521
But I knew that being a cop
doesn't put you above the law!

357
00:38:16,167 --> 00:38:18,260
Using certain methods...

358
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:21,939
puts you lower down
than your so-called vermin.

359
00:38:30,681 --> 00:38:33,980
Have you sent
Hollec's P.38 to the lab?

360
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:36,987
Yes.

361
00:39:14,392 --> 00:39:17,293
- Nothing to tell me?
- I don't talk to cops.

362
00:39:19,163 --> 00:39:22,462
- You prefer crooks.
- To each his own.

363
00:39:23,668 --> 00:39:25,431
Crooks don't become a habit.

364
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:28,598
My guys don't have time
to dirty the sheets.

365
00:39:31,275 --> 00:39:34,403
You'll be accused
of protecting a criminal.

366
00:39:34,512 --> 00:39:36,377
That's rather good.

367
00:39:37,481 --> 00:39:40,279
Buisson is a killer.
He won't hesitate to kill you.

368
00:39:40,985 --> 00:39:43,351
Then it's normal to rat him out?

369
00:40:00,237 --> 00:40:04,139
You had guns in your place,
and Buisson, who killed a patrolman.

370
00:40:05,009 --> 00:40:07,068
You'll be charged
along with the rest.

371
00:40:07,178 --> 00:40:08,475
If you like.

372
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:13,980
Believe me, I'm not pleased that
you'll go in for four or five years.

373
00:40:20,491 --> 00:40:21,753
Thanks.

374
00:40:32,003 --> 00:40:33,470
I won't insist.

375
00:40:34,171 --> 00:40:36,469
You don't cooperate,
I'll put you inside.

376
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,487
Not bad, eh?

377
00:40:54,191 --> 00:40:57,126
- Mind if your brother's guillotined?
- He hasn't done anything!

378
00:40:58,496 --> 00:41:00,123
Unfortunately, he has.

379
00:41:00,665 --> 00:41:03,293
And soon you'll have to choose
between Buisson and him.

380
00:41:08,205 --> 00:41:11,766
Well, my colleague
will ask you some questions.

381
00:41:12,743 --> 00:41:16,372
He'll note if you refuse to answer
or refuse to sign.

382
00:41:17,148 --> 00:41:18,615
There it is.

383
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:22,278
You're in a real mess.

384
00:41:22,987 --> 00:41:25,581
Nobody but me has
the slightest wish to save you.

385
00:41:26,624 --> 00:41:27,886
How kind.

386
00:41:31,929 --> 00:41:33,396
All yours.

387
00:41:38,436 --> 00:41:40,563
Your name is Suzanne Bollec?

388
00:41:49,013 --> 00:41:51,106
Is this gun yours?

389
00:41:58,456 --> 00:42:00,356
You had it when we arrested you.

390
00:42:00,458 --> 00:42:02,688
- You gonna deny that?
- I didn't use it.

391
00:42:04,061 --> 00:42:07,030
You couldn't. It was jammed.

392
00:42:08,566 --> 00:42:10,761
Unfortunately for you,
I have the ballistics.

393
00:42:16,974 --> 00:42:19,067
Some bullets from your P.38...

394
00:42:20,444 --> 00:42:23,174
were found in the body
of Alfred Thibon...

395
00:42:24,548 --> 00:42:26,846
Freddy the Accordionist.

396
00:42:29,053 --> 00:42:31,521
Mean anything to you?

397
00:42:38,829 --> 00:42:41,263
He got taken out
on September 3,

398
00:42:41,365 --> 00:42:43,230
the same day Emile Buisson escaped.

399
00:42:45,703 --> 00:42:47,500
You don't waste time.

400
00:42:48,205 --> 00:42:50,002
I had nothing to do with it.

401
00:42:53,043 --> 00:42:54,840
But that's nothing.

402
00:42:54,945 --> 00:42:57,880
Can't expect crooks to settle scores
with a kid's game.

403
00:43:02,787 --> 00:43:07,315
But your little gun
also killed Officer Schmitt,

404
00:43:07,858 --> 00:43:10,326
highway patrolman
and father of three.

405
00:43:11,195 --> 00:43:13,925
Photo enlargement leaves no doubt.

406
00:43:19,069 --> 00:43:20,696
Look at your gun.

407
00:43:24,074 --> 00:43:26,269
It's gonna cost you, René.

408
00:43:28,045 --> 00:43:29,012
It's not mine!

409
00:43:31,482 --> 00:43:33,279
No need to shout.

410
00:43:35,953 --> 00:43:37,079
I showed it to your sister.

411
00:43:38,789 --> 00:43:40,256
She recognized it.

412
00:43:41,325 --> 00:43:43,555
I doubt it.
She doesn't know a thing about guns.

413
00:43:52,837 --> 00:43:55,067
Then tell me why
you had it on you.

414
00:43:56,106 --> 00:44:00,566
When I was clearing out,
I took the first I found.

415
00:44:01,779 --> 00:44:03,076
But it's not mine.

416
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:05,148
Then it's Emile Buisson's.

417
00:44:07,184 --> 00:44:09,243
He wasn't with us.

418
00:44:09,353 --> 00:44:10,877
Oh, yeah. That's right.

419
00:44:10,988 --> 00:44:12,979
It was...
What's his name?

420
00:44:15,793 --> 00:44:18,159
That's right, Muller.

421
00:44:19,363 --> 00:44:21,490
So it's Muller's gun.

422
00:44:24,034 --> 00:44:25,968
You expect me to believe that?

423
00:44:30,808 --> 00:44:33,709
I hope you like escargot.

424
00:44:33,811 --> 00:44:35,244
They're very good.

425
00:44:36,447 --> 00:44:40,406
A police officer brings them
from the countryside.

426
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:43,746
It's Sunday tomorrow.

427
00:44:44,455 --> 00:44:47,083
Shall I wake you for church,

428
00:44:47,958 --> 00:44:49,585
Mr. Chabert?

429
00:44:51,629 --> 00:44:56,191
I guess you don't like priests too much.

430
00:45:37,541 --> 00:45:39,270
You were lucky.

431
00:45:40,811 --> 00:45:41,903
Glad to see you.

432
00:45:48,986 --> 00:45:50,681
Bring the supplies?

433
00:45:53,824 --> 00:45:55,849
Get me a grenade.

434
00:45:56,393 --> 00:45:59,851
A fragmentation grenade
from the army.

435
00:46:00,431 --> 00:46:02,399
What the heck
you gonna do with that?

436
00:46:02,499 --> 00:46:05,798
Blow up the first cop
that comes my way.

437
00:46:22,453 --> 00:46:24,580
- I went to the Armenian.
- And?

438
00:46:24,688 --> 00:46:27,020
Disappeared two days ago
with the stuff.

439
00:46:27,124 --> 00:46:28,591
What you make of that?

440
00:46:40,104 --> 00:46:42,231
The doctor said
not to take too long.

441
00:46:42,339 --> 00:46:43,806
Number four.

442
00:47:02,593 --> 00:47:04,891
I thought I smelled a pig.

443
00:47:05,429 --> 00:47:07,056
Have a seat.

444
00:47:15,939 --> 00:47:18,032
Good of you to come.

445
00:47:18,142 --> 00:47:21,305
I get bored, miss my friends.

446
00:47:21,845 --> 00:47:23,642
What's your name?

447
00:47:24,515 --> 00:47:26,483
You've got the roles backwards,
Jean-Baptiste.

448
00:47:26,583 --> 00:47:29,711
Why should cops
always ask the questions?

449
00:47:31,922 --> 00:47:34,413
You the famous Borniche?

450
00:47:38,629 --> 00:47:40,893
I hear you eat grilled gangster
for breakfast.

451
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:45,193
About the Arbois Inn
and Officer Schmitt.

452
00:47:45,302 --> 00:47:46,929
There's little time. You're tired.

453
00:47:47,037 --> 00:47:49,471
I'm fine. Stay as long as you like.

454
00:47:50,841 --> 00:47:54,572
Bollec has confessed. This is routine.

455
00:47:58,015 --> 00:47:59,312
Got a smoke?

456
00:48:10,994 --> 00:48:13,724
I'll have one later
while thinking of you.

457
00:48:14,431 --> 00:48:16,592
Thanks, kid.
Got a light?

458
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:35,315
The name of your guy?

459
00:48:36,019 --> 00:48:38,647
René Bollec.

460
00:48:40,924 --> 00:48:42,084
Never heard of him.

461
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:44,654
Ever hear of your brother?

462
00:48:46,864 --> 00:48:48,991
I read he'd escaped.

463
00:48:49,099 --> 00:48:53,058
I'll tell you his problem.
He was in bad company.

464
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:56,435
Otherwise, he never would've
hurt anyone, not even a cop.

465
00:48:58,542 --> 00:48:59,839
I'm sure of it.

466
00:48:59,943 --> 00:49:03,902
September 3, I was in Dijon.
My sister will confirm it.

467
00:49:04,982 --> 00:49:07,712
Hope you have
another alibi for the court.

468
00:49:09,686 --> 00:49:12,655
Borniche,
I don't want to waste your time.

469
00:49:12,756 --> 00:49:15,884
I'm 52.
I'm not about to fall into your traps.

470
00:49:15,993 --> 00:49:17,984
I know nothing.

471
00:49:18,095 --> 00:49:20,120
I lost my memory in 1937.

472
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:21,697
Exactly 10 years ago.

473
00:49:22,232 --> 00:49:24,757
Covered by the statute of limitations.

474
00:49:25,302 --> 00:49:28,169
If you get that,
you got it all.

475
00:49:28,906 --> 00:49:30,533
Leaving already?

476
00:49:30,641 --> 00:49:33,474
I got it all.
No need for a statement.

477
00:49:36,613 --> 00:49:39,480
- Here. It's the real stuff.
- Thanks, cop.

478
00:49:40,184 --> 00:49:43,119
Deep down, you're not a bad guy.
Come back to see me.

479
00:49:43,654 --> 00:49:47,454
I'll tell you all about Indochina.
It might teach you something.

480
00:49:47,558 --> 00:49:49,924
I'll leave the teaching
toJudge Boissenade.

481
00:49:50,594 --> 00:49:53,154
You'll see.
He's a very serious guy.

482
00:49:53,897 --> 00:49:57,162
That's all we need, the justice system
in the hands of clowns.

483
00:50:01,305 --> 00:50:02,772
Bye, Borniche.

484
00:50:04,341 --> 00:50:07,799
If you see Emile,
say hello for me.

485
00:50:14,318 --> 00:50:15,785
If you have time.

486
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:31,990
Hands on the bar, Raymond.

487
00:50:43,146 --> 00:50:45,046
What's the matter, Emile?

488
00:50:45,148 --> 00:50:46,945
Where are the jewels?

489
00:50:47,050 --> 00:50:50,110
The Armenian, he's checking them.

490
00:50:50,654 --> 00:50:52,121
I told your brother.

491
00:50:52,222 --> 00:50:54,156
You know where he is?

492
00:50:55,192 --> 00:50:56,989
Must have heard it on the radio.

493
00:50:58,195 --> 00:50:59,822
I just came down.

494
00:51:00,597 --> 00:51:02,064
I went to bed late.

495
00:51:02,666 --> 00:51:04,133
You bastard!

496
00:51:32,996 --> 00:51:34,930
Borniche, Federal Police.

497
00:51:37,501 --> 00:51:41,460
Raymond Pelletier, the owner.
Shot behind his bar.

498
00:51:53,517 --> 00:51:55,678
Buisson?

499
00:51:55,786 --> 00:51:58,949
I was upstairs. I saw nothing.

500
00:52:00,023 --> 00:52:02,890
I came down when I heard the shots.

501
00:52:04,127 --> 00:52:06,493
Did he come here?

502
00:52:06,596 --> 00:52:08,791
Did he come to see Raymond last week?

503
00:52:10,434 --> 00:52:13,335
Raymond was straight.

504
00:52:15,639 --> 00:52:17,903
It's disgusting to kill him like that.

505
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:26,949
Buisson's crazy.
You don't have to protect him.

506
00:52:30,253 --> 00:52:31,880
Who was with him?

507
00:52:31,988 --> 00:52:33,785
Leave me alone.

508
00:52:34,558 --> 00:52:36,185
Isn't this enough?

509
00:52:36,727 --> 00:52:39,355
Who did he come with last week?

510
00:52:40,731 --> 00:52:42,722
His brother and...

511
00:52:44,468 --> 00:52:45,435
And?

512
00:52:49,439 --> 00:52:50,406
Mario.

513
00:52:52,542 --> 00:52:54,009
A wop.

514
00:52:55,879 --> 00:52:57,506
He has a woman.

515
00:52:58,448 --> 00:53:00,848
She's a hooker near St. Denis.

516
00:53:01,385 --> 00:53:02,852
Know her name?

517
00:53:05,155 --> 00:53:06,349
Jenny.

518
00:53:09,726 --> 00:53:11,353
Is that all you can tell me?

519
00:53:11,461 --> 00:53:13,088
Isn't that enough?

520
00:53:15,499 --> 00:53:18,195
She's blond, Polish.

521
00:53:25,308 --> 00:53:27,367
Thanks, Mado.

522
00:53:34,985 --> 00:53:37,715
The Polack's in a meeting.
Choose another one.

523
00:53:39,489 --> 00:53:43,448
She just went up, I'll call.

524
00:53:44,728 --> 00:53:45,695
I don't want her.

525
00:53:55,472 --> 00:53:57,099
I want the Wop.

526
00:53:58,809 --> 00:54:00,276
What? The Wop?

527
00:54:01,645 --> 00:54:03,112
I'm in a hurry.

528
00:54:03,213 --> 00:54:05,647
Perhaps you don't know Mario the Wop.

529
00:54:07,017 --> 00:54:09,542
I do, but I never see him.

530
00:54:12,756 --> 00:54:14,621
Do your best to see him.

531
00:54:15,158 --> 00:54:16,955
If not, I'll have this rotten joint busted

532
00:54:18,395 --> 00:54:21,853
I've got reasons enough
to put you in the slammer.

533
00:54:23,567 --> 00:54:24,625
Like the plan?

534
00:54:26,336 --> 00:54:27,963
He never comes here, I swear.

535
00:54:32,976 --> 00:54:35,444
He works in the Étoile area.

536
00:54:36,313 --> 00:54:40,477
You can call him at the Calanques Bar.

537
00:54:43,253 --> 00:54:45,813
I knew you wanted
to help your country.

538
00:54:46,523 --> 00:54:49,390
If he's really done something wrong,

539
00:54:49,493 --> 00:54:51,552
it's only natural I should help a bit.

540
00:54:51,661 --> 00:54:53,128
It's only natural.

541
00:54:53,964 --> 00:54:54,931
There.

542
00:54:57,901 --> 00:55:00,028
- Evening.
- Number four.

543
00:55:01,071 --> 00:55:03,005
Don't forget the tip, baby.

544
00:55:09,112 --> 00:55:10,101
Go on.

545
00:55:45,415 --> 00:55:48,043
Help! Robbery!

546
00:55:51,988 --> 00:55:53,922
What's gotten into you?
You crazy?

547
00:56:15,211 --> 00:56:16,803
Call me at the Calanques.

548
00:56:16,913 --> 00:56:18,471
I'll call you at the Calanques.

549
00:56:45,275 --> 00:56:46,902
I came to make your bed.

550
00:56:50,113 --> 00:56:51,978
I didn't ask you to.

551
00:56:53,049 --> 00:56:57,008
- What are you looking for?
- Nothing. Now I know who you are.

552
00:57:01,091 --> 00:57:02,718
I just want to help.

553
00:57:06,763 --> 00:57:10,221
Get out of here
and don't come back.

554
00:57:26,282 --> 00:57:28,341
Wait at the end of the street.

555
00:57:32,455 --> 00:57:35,356
- Don't be long.
- Ten minutes.

556
00:57:35,458 --> 00:57:38,757
- Let's not miss the beginning.
- You'll see the movie.

557
00:58:04,087 --> 00:58:05,554
Evening, Ange.

558
00:58:14,597 --> 00:58:16,087
Evening, Inspector.

559
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,427
Give me a martini.

560
00:58:23,106 --> 00:58:25,836
- What's wrong, Ange?
- Nothing, I'm fine.

561
00:58:25,942 --> 00:58:27,569
You don't look it.

562
00:58:27,677 --> 00:58:31,010
A little nauseous.
I must've eaten something bad.

563
00:58:32,048 --> 00:58:33,948
Take care of your health, Ange.

564
00:58:35,652 --> 00:58:38,120
We'd hate to lose you.

565
00:58:48,965 --> 00:58:50,432
Know him?

566
00:58:53,136 --> 00:58:54,603
An Italian.

567
00:58:55,572 --> 00:58:57,199
I'm told he comes here.

568
00:58:59,209 --> 00:59:01,370
You were told wrong, Inspector.

569
00:59:06,416 --> 00:59:08,043
Evil gossip.

570
00:59:08,151 --> 00:59:10,278
The Italian do anything wrong?

571
00:59:10,987 --> 00:59:14,150
Think about it. When we want someone,
it's for his own good.

572
00:59:14,257 --> 00:59:15,588
That's true.

573
00:59:18,762 --> 00:59:21,060
No, you'll offend me.

574
00:59:22,098 --> 00:59:23,588
Then I'll offend you.

575
00:59:25,602 --> 00:59:27,229
See you soon, Ange.

576
00:59:29,939 --> 00:59:31,236
Night.

577
00:59:53,129 --> 00:59:54,426
You know who just left?

578
00:59:55,498 --> 00:59:56,726
A cop.

579
00:59:57,267 --> 00:59:59,565
Not just any cop,
Inspector Borniche.

580
01:00:02,438 --> 01:00:04,065
What did he want?

581
01:00:04,774 --> 01:00:07,072
To know if Mario came here.

582
01:00:07,944 --> 01:00:09,571
That's interesting.

583
01:00:15,585 --> 01:00:16,552
Damn.

584
01:00:17,253 --> 01:00:18,982
I was scared.

585
01:00:20,123 --> 01:00:21,954
You should've told me.

586
01:00:22,058 --> 01:00:24,788
I would have shot your buddy.

587
01:00:34,337 --> 01:00:38,239
Bullets from the same Colt.45.

588
01:00:40,310 --> 01:00:41,277
Well?

589
01:00:41,811 --> 01:00:45,269
The same gun killed Pelletier
and the bank collector.

590
01:00:45,381 --> 01:00:46,848
Buisson again.

591
01:00:50,286 --> 01:00:52,254
They want you to listen to the tapes.

592
01:00:52,355 --> 01:00:54,687
I had the phone
in the Calanques Bar tapped.

593
01:00:54,791 --> 01:00:57,487
A friend of Buisson's receives calls there.
You never know.

594
01:00:58,027 --> 01:00:59,654
Thanks, Mr. Legal.

595
01:01:09,439 --> 01:01:10,770
What weather.

596
01:01:10,874 --> 01:01:12,671
All we need is snow.

597
01:01:16,479 --> 01:01:18,310
Got another recording.

598
01:01:18,414 --> 01:01:20,041
Somebody called for Mario.

599
01:01:21,851 --> 01:01:23,375
It must be Buisson.

600
01:01:23,486 --> 01:01:25,477
<i>Don't come. I've moved. </i>

601
01:01:26,756 --> 01:01:28,223
<i>What time tomorrow? </i>

602
01:01:28,324 --> 01:01:30,884
<i>5:00 in Vincennes Forest,
Champigny Highway. </i>

603
01:01:31,427 --> 01:01:33,088
<i>Where exactly? </i>

604
01:01:33,196 --> 01:01:35,061
<i>The Fourchette,
behind the yellow cabin. </i>

605
01:01:35,164 --> 01:01:38,031
<i>- What car?
- A black Simca 1000.</i>

606
01:01:38,134 --> 01:01:39,465
<i>Bye, Mario. See you tomorrow. </i>

607
01:02:52,809 --> 01:02:54,276
Roger, he's leaving.

608
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:58,747
Let him go.

609
01:02:59,415 --> 01:03:00,882
We'll get him at the Calanques.

610
01:03:00,984 --> 01:03:02,508
If he sees he's followed, it's over.

611
01:03:04,554 --> 01:03:06,021
I'll never get it.

612
01:03:06,556 --> 01:03:07,853
Bust our ass to catch guys,

613
01:03:07,957 --> 01:03:10,425
and once we get them,
we let them go.

614
01:03:21,304 --> 01:03:22,931
I waited over an hour.

615
01:03:24,474 --> 01:03:26,601
It's odd he didn't show up.

616
01:03:28,144 --> 01:03:30,874
He changes his mind sometimes.

617
01:03:31,914 --> 01:03:34,781
Put yourself in his shoes.
On the run, you get wary.

618
01:03:35,985 --> 01:03:39,421
We should visit the factory
in St. Denis.

619
01:03:41,724 --> 01:03:44,591
There's no time to loose.
Payday is Tuesday.

620
01:03:44,694 --> 01:03:46,321
Yes, it's urgent.

621
01:03:56,939 --> 01:03:57,735
Gentlemen.

622
01:04:19,095 --> 01:04:20,062
Hello.

623
01:04:21,197 --> 01:04:24,826
Jeannot, the friend I told you about
for the next job.

624
01:04:34,644 --> 01:04:36,271
I don't get it, Emile.

625
01:04:36,379 --> 01:04:38,176
About the meeting?

626
01:04:39,482 --> 01:04:41,109
I'll explain later.

627
01:04:42,018 --> 01:04:43,747
- Miss.
- Coming.

628
01:04:45,121 --> 01:04:46,918
My treat.

629
01:04:48,157 --> 01:04:50,125
Looks like the food's good here.

630
01:04:50,226 --> 01:04:51,693
Very good.

631
01:04:52,562 --> 01:04:54,655
I didn't expect to see you here.

632
01:04:54,764 --> 01:04:56,231
You know...

633
01:04:58,101 --> 01:04:59,966
no one ever expects to see me.

634
01:05:00,069 --> 01:05:02,401
Sometimes I just show up.

635
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:13,908
What does that mean, Emile?

636
01:05:16,953 --> 01:05:18,011
Nothing.

637
01:05:18,855 --> 01:05:20,584
I'm having a laugh.

638
01:05:21,324 --> 01:05:23,292
I like to have a laugh
now and then.

639
01:05:24,594 --> 01:05:27,791
Paulo said you ate here often,
so we stopped by just in case.

640
01:05:29,165 --> 01:05:30,962
I'll take a pâté to start.

641
01:05:33,402 --> 01:05:34,369
Me too.

642
01:05:46,149 --> 01:05:49,243
Good night, gentlemen.

643
01:05:52,955 --> 01:05:56,652
Come to my place for a drink?

644
01:05:57,460 --> 01:05:58,586
Where's that?

645
01:05:58,694 --> 01:06:01,788
Ville d'Avray. I've got a little place
on the road to Versailles.

646
01:06:02,331 --> 01:06:05,698
I've got a date with a girl
when she gets off work.

647
01:06:05,801 --> 01:06:07,268
She can wait.

648
01:06:07,370 --> 01:06:09,497
It's good for chicks.

649
01:06:12,141 --> 01:06:14,041
You can't refuse a drink.

650
01:06:41,304 --> 01:06:43,238
Must be the ignition.

651
01:06:47,643 --> 01:06:49,941
I'll take a leak.

652
01:06:50,646 --> 01:06:52,546
Not a bad idea.

653
01:07:13,603 --> 01:07:15,230
Now, Wop!

654
01:07:16,939 --> 01:07:18,907
What are you doing, Emile?

655
01:07:19,775 --> 01:07:22,573
Born in the Year of the Rat,
weren't you?

656
01:07:24,614 --> 01:07:26,081
You crazy?

657
01:07:26,782 --> 01:07:28,409
You asshole.

658
01:07:30,119 --> 01:07:32,246
You keep out of this.

659
01:07:40,296 --> 01:07:41,456
Paulo.

660
01:07:44,133 --> 01:07:45,430
The Wop was an informer.

661
01:07:48,137 --> 01:07:50,128
I didn't have time to warn you.

662
01:07:51,340 --> 01:07:54,309
The cops were waiting
at the meeting spot today.

663
01:07:59,415 --> 01:08:01,576
He won't be chatting
with them anymore.

664
01:08:48,564 --> 01:08:51,032
Let's clear out.
Quick.

665
01:09:08,317 --> 01:09:09,614
Hurry up!

666
01:09:12,488 --> 01:09:14,115
Quick!

667
01:09:30,272 --> 01:09:31,739
The bastard.

668
01:09:33,442 --> 01:09:38,243
"Worker, Former Resistance Member,
Victim of Killer Buisson.

669
01:09:38,881 --> 01:09:42,510
Our friend Guégan
gave his life for Capital.

670
01:09:42,618 --> 01:09:46,418
While Mr. Jules Moch's police
are beating up miners in the north,

671
01:09:46,522 --> 01:09:50,925
Emile Buisson is still on the loose,
shamelessly killing innocent workers.

672
01:09:51,026 --> 01:09:54,154
What are the geniuses
at the Federal Police up to?

673
01:09:55,197 --> 01:09:57,597
Where are these cops,

674
01:09:57,700 --> 01:10:01,192
called 'supermen' by certain
members of the press corps."

675
01:10:01,303 --> 01:10:03,100
That's for Borniche.

676
01:10:03,806 --> 01:10:08,140
They attack Moch, he'll attack us.

677
01:10:08,244 --> 01:10:10,712
Not to mention the unions.

678
01:10:10,813 --> 01:10:12,804
Right now, it's a big joke.

679
01:10:13,349 --> 01:10:15,647
- Where's Borniche?
- It's his day off.

680
01:10:15,751 --> 01:10:17,912
I'll give him a goddamn day off!

681
01:10:18,020 --> 01:10:21,217
Along with the whole bunch of you!

682
01:10:21,323 --> 01:10:23,154
The Buisson case is closed!

683
01:10:23,759 --> 01:10:25,386
I'm taking you off it.

684
01:10:28,497 --> 01:10:30,624
Get me Borniche at home.

685
01:10:31,333 --> 01:10:32,800
Yeah, hurry up.

686
01:10:39,575 --> 01:10:41,475
Good morning.

687
01:10:41,577 --> 01:10:43,374
Yes, he's here.
I'll get him.

688
01:10:54,290 --> 01:10:55,814
It's for you.

689
01:10:55,925 --> 01:10:58,052
- Who is it?
- The boss.

690
01:11:03,332 --> 01:11:05,095
Morning, Chief.

691
01:11:06,969 --> 01:11:08,436
I can't answer so fast.

692
01:11:08,537 --> 01:11:10,505
You know I've done everything I could.

693
01:11:17,179 --> 01:11:18,237
Okay.

694
01:11:20,449 --> 01:11:22,246
As you like.

695
01:11:23,118 --> 01:11:26,918
I'm more likely to get him
than Degreffe.

696
01:11:31,126 --> 01:11:33,094
See you tomorrow, sir.

697
01:12:14,670 --> 01:12:16,137
What was that about?

698
01:12:17,506 --> 01:12:19,838
I'm off the Buisson case.

699
01:12:19,942 --> 01:12:22,410
He woke you to say that?
He's insane.

700
01:12:23,579 --> 01:12:25,342
He's a civil servant.

701
01:12:25,447 --> 01:12:26,914
He's afraid of his superiors.

702
01:12:27,449 --> 01:12:29,679
You can't let yourself
be abused like that.

703
01:12:40,162 --> 01:12:41,789
Some days.

704
01:12:44,333 --> 01:12:46,301
Some days what?

705
01:12:48,003 --> 01:12:50,631
I'd like to be Emile Buisson.

706
01:12:54,610 --> 01:12:56,237
For God's sake!

707
01:12:58,380 --> 01:13:00,041
10,000 bread tickets,

708
01:13:00,149 --> 01:13:02,777
as many gasoline tickets,
and you deny it?

709
01:13:03,652 --> 01:13:06,849
What, the devil goes to work
in your print shop at night?

710
01:13:07,623 --> 01:13:10,421
You should check my employees.

711
01:13:25,975 --> 01:13:27,704
Nice work.

712
01:13:28,744 --> 01:13:30,371
Come on.

713
01:13:31,246 --> 01:13:32,713
Be reasonable.

714
01:13:32,815 --> 01:13:35,784
If not,
we might get mad.

715
01:13:36,318 --> 01:13:38,115
Come with me.

716
01:13:38,220 --> 01:13:40,688
A corpse near Versailles.

717
01:13:40,789 --> 01:13:42,689
The chief chose us.

718
01:13:44,293 --> 01:13:45,760
How kind.

719
01:13:46,962 --> 01:13:48,589
I'll leave you with him.

720
01:13:54,637 --> 01:13:57,265
I advise you not to waste our time.

721
01:15:00,102 --> 01:15:03,731
Didn't find much.
A settling of scores.

722
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:05,464
Let's see the face.

723
01:15:13,148 --> 01:15:14,615
Come look.

724
01:15:15,484 --> 01:15:17,179
Looks like the Wop.

725
01:15:18,153 --> 01:15:19,313
Mario?

726
01:15:22,291 --> 01:15:24,384
I'm sure of it.

727
01:15:24,493 --> 01:15:26,393
I'll be damned.

728
01:15:28,297 --> 01:15:29,764
How's that for luck?

729
01:15:29,865 --> 01:15:31,332
You know him?

730
01:15:32,367 --> 01:15:34,494
Probably know who killed him too.

731
01:15:42,811 --> 01:15:44,438
That's great!

732
01:15:44,546 --> 01:15:46,343
Now you interfere in our work!

733
01:15:46,448 --> 01:15:47,915
Turn it down a notch.

734
01:15:48,016 --> 01:15:51,247
What do you want?
Got a warrant?

735
01:15:51,353 --> 01:15:52,980
Warrant or not,
you're coming with us.

736
01:15:53,088 --> 01:15:55,716
I am not!
I wasn't soliciting!

737
01:15:55,824 --> 01:15:57,587
That guy your fiancé?

738
01:15:58,127 --> 01:16:01,062
We're just looking for
Mario's murderer. That's all.

739
01:16:02,264 --> 01:16:04,061
I don't give a damn about him!

740
01:16:04,166 --> 01:16:07,226
I got nothing to do with him.
If he croaked, that's too bad.

741
01:16:07,336 --> 01:16:09,600
I left him more than a year ago.

742
01:16:09,705 --> 01:16:12,401
Want me to give him
a first class funeral?

743
01:16:13,041 --> 01:16:14,474
Maybe you know his friends.

744
01:16:14,576 --> 01:16:16,806
I know nothing!
And I've got nothing to say!

745
01:16:17,346 --> 01:16:19,507
All I got to give is my ass!

746
01:16:19,615 --> 01:16:21,810
That good enough for you?

747
01:16:21,917 --> 01:16:25,011
Whatever you say, Jenny.
We might take you up on that.

748
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:28,317
That's it!
The pigs will send me a ham.

749
01:16:28,423 --> 01:16:29,890
For Christmas.

750
01:16:37,633 --> 01:16:39,157
What you laughing at, jerk?

751
01:16:41,737 --> 01:16:43,034
Come to think of it,

752
01:16:43,906 --> 01:16:46,136
you knew him too,

753
01:16:46,241 --> 01:16:48,334
Mario the Wop?

754
01:16:48,443 --> 01:16:50,604
No, not well.

755
01:16:51,146 --> 01:16:52,773
His friends?

756
01:16:52,881 --> 01:16:54,576
I never saw his friends.

757
01:16:56,251 --> 01:16:58,378
You never saw anyone in the bar?

758
01:16:58,487 --> 01:17:00,387
No, I swear, Inspector.

759
01:17:06,695 --> 01:17:08,526
Just warming up.

760
01:17:08,630 --> 01:17:10,928
- My glasses.
- Don't need to see.

761
01:17:11,466 --> 01:17:13,093
Just need to talk.

762
01:17:14,303 --> 01:17:15,770
You skunk.

763
01:17:16,538 --> 01:17:17,505
Well?

764
01:17:19,374 --> 01:17:21,569
Who did Mario see?

765
01:17:22,644 --> 01:17:25,738
If you got nothing to say,
we'll get you for running a whorehouse.

766
01:17:25,848 --> 01:17:27,748
Your deal with the Vice Squad
won't help!

767
01:17:27,850 --> 01:17:29,841
I don't know.

768
01:17:30,552 --> 01:17:31,951
Sometimes he came with Paulo.

769
01:17:32,054 --> 01:17:33,351
Paulo?

770
01:17:33,455 --> 01:17:34,615
Paulo what?

771
01:17:34,723 --> 01:17:38,181
The bomber, his wife is sick.

772
01:17:39,394 --> 01:17:39,951
Syphilis?

773
01:17:40,062 --> 01:17:44,396
No, TB. She's in a home.

774
01:17:45,767 --> 01:17:47,564
Where does he live?

775
01:17:47,669 --> 01:17:49,534
I don't know.

776
01:17:51,073 --> 01:17:52,802
It's probably in our files.

777
01:17:56,845 --> 01:17:58,312
Come on.

778
01:18:05,254 --> 01:18:06,881
Alias Paulo the Bomber.

779
01:18:06,989 --> 01:18:10,481
Listed in the special file,
"The Fight Against Gangsters."

780
01:18:11,026 --> 01:18:15,326
Paul Roubier, alias Paulo the Bomber.
Born March 29, 1904.

781
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:20,600
This might be a good lead.

782
01:18:23,005 --> 01:18:24,905
- Well?
- Look.

783
01:18:25,007 --> 01:18:27,475
With Buisson in '42
at the Victories Street holdup.

784
01:18:27,576 --> 01:18:29,874
They got off for lack of proof.

785
01:18:29,978 --> 01:18:31,605
Victories or Victory Street?

786
01:18:31,713 --> 01:18:33,180
Victories.

787
01:18:33,715 --> 01:18:35,512
I'll send out a wanted notice.

788
01:18:36,718 --> 01:18:38,652
No, just find his wife.

789
01:18:39,688 --> 01:18:40,882
What?

790
01:18:58,340 --> 01:19:00,240
Don't be sad.

791
01:19:01,610 --> 01:19:03,407
See you next week.

792
01:19:39,614 --> 01:19:42,208
- Give me a ride to Paris, Roubier?
- What do you want?

793
01:19:42,317 --> 01:19:44,444
We're not in the same club,
but we can still have a chat.

794
01:19:45,988 --> 01:19:50,516
The Pacra factory is offering a million
to anyone helping to arrest the killer.

795
01:19:51,626 --> 01:19:53,457
The killer is Emile Buisson.

796
01:19:56,131 --> 01:19:58,361
You've worked for less.

797
01:19:59,201 --> 01:20:01,431
Get that crooked head thinking.

798
01:20:04,806 --> 01:20:07,468
What you're doing is disgusting.

799
01:20:10,178 --> 01:20:12,646
If you refuse,
it'll get even more disgusting.

800
01:20:13,849 --> 01:20:16,818
You need streptomycin
to save your wife.

801
01:20:17,619 --> 01:20:20,486
I promise I'll get it from the States.

802
01:20:23,325 --> 01:20:26,783
You gonna hesitate between
a killer like Buisson and your wife?

803
01:20:31,833 --> 01:20:33,460
Another thing.

804
01:20:35,237 --> 01:20:37,705
I know you were a friend of
Mario the Wop.

805
01:20:39,241 --> 01:20:42,210
Emile killed him for nothing.

806
01:20:45,247 --> 01:20:47,374
The Wop wasn't an informer.

807
01:20:47,916 --> 01:20:50,009
Mr. Emile got that one wrong.

808
01:20:50,552 --> 01:20:53,020
We'll spread the word around.

809
01:21:02,064 --> 01:21:04,498
But in case you don't cooperate,

810
01:21:04,599 --> 01:21:06,931
I'm sure you were
in the latest holdups.

811
01:21:08,637 --> 01:21:10,104
And I'll prove it.

812
01:21:11,073 --> 01:21:14,042
I'll send you up
for 15 to 20 years.

813
01:21:14,743 --> 01:21:17,041
You'll never see your wife again.

814
01:21:28,990 --> 01:21:30,457
I hate myself.

815
01:21:38,667 --> 01:21:40,134
Me too.

816
01:21:41,002 --> 01:21:42,902
But we have no choice,

817
01:21:44,005 --> 01:21:46,473
either one of us.

818
01:22:09,131 --> 01:22:10,598
Hi.

819
01:22:14,069 --> 01:22:17,197
A tip, the Versailles tax office.

820
01:22:17,306 --> 01:22:18,933
There's a pile.

821
01:22:19,475 --> 01:22:21,602
- How much?
- 12 to 15 grand.

822
01:22:23,145 --> 01:22:24,271
The hideout?

823
01:22:24,379 --> 01:22:27,177
I found something
in the countryside, a hotel.

824
01:22:27,282 --> 01:22:28,749
I know the owner.

825
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:33,054
Gotta find me a piece.

826
01:22:33,756 --> 01:22:35,724
Mine's hot.
It's gotta go down the drain.

827
01:22:35,824 --> 01:22:37,724
I'll find you one.

828
01:22:37,826 --> 01:22:39,453
A P.38, if possible.

829
01:22:41,330 --> 01:22:43,525
I always liked them.

830
01:22:48,504 --> 01:22:50,665
What? A gun for Buisson?

831
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:52,834
Are you mad, Borniche?

832
01:22:55,043 --> 01:22:57,773
Do you realize what you're asking for?

833
01:22:57,880 --> 01:22:59,507
A P.38,

834
01:22:59,615 --> 01:23:01,276
if possible.

835
01:23:02,885 --> 01:23:04,352
A P.38?

836
01:23:06,188 --> 01:23:07,917
He prefers them.

837
01:23:12,628 --> 01:23:16,086
What if we give him a Colt?
Will he throw a tantrum?

838
01:23:19,234 --> 01:23:22,294
You know what his temper is like.

839
01:23:22,404 --> 01:23:24,031
Listen, Borniche.

840
01:23:24,139 --> 01:23:26,664
This time you've crossed the line!

841
01:23:26,775 --> 01:23:30,233
You put yourself back
in charge of the Buisson case.

842
01:23:30,345 --> 01:23:32,939
You invented a ridiculous story!

843
01:23:33,048 --> 01:23:35,243
Excuse me, Chief.

844
01:23:35,350 --> 01:23:37,818
You told me to investigate
a corpse in the Ville d'Avray.

845
01:23:38,353 --> 01:23:40,446
Am I to blame
if it brought me back to Buisson?

846
01:23:40,556 --> 01:23:44,287
- You kept it to yourself.
- I wanted to be sure.

847
01:23:44,393 --> 01:23:46,224
That suited you.

848
01:23:46,328 --> 01:23:47,295
So,

849
01:23:47,396 --> 01:23:52,698
now we give Mr. Buisson
a vacation in a country hotel.

850
01:23:52,801 --> 01:23:57,431
And on top of that, you want
to give him a gun to shoot us with?

851
01:23:58,240 --> 01:23:59,468
Really.

852
01:24:00,175 --> 01:24:05,135
It's become a huge joke.

853
01:24:06,281 --> 01:24:08,010
I'll get Buisson a P.38.

854
01:24:08,116 --> 01:24:11,051
Where, Inspector?

855
01:24:11,153 --> 01:24:13,280
A souvenir of French commandos.

856
01:24:14,223 --> 01:24:17,192
If anything happens,
I'll have you locked up.

857
01:24:17,893 --> 01:24:19,520
Do you hear me?

858
01:24:20,229 --> 01:24:22,094
Very well, sir.

859
01:24:22,197 --> 01:24:23,960
My regards.

860
01:24:53,161 --> 01:24:54,253
Here.

861
01:25:57,592 --> 01:25:59,219
It wasn't easy.

862
01:26:07,269 --> 01:26:09,169
Just kidding.

863
01:26:12,474 --> 01:26:13,600
Your tax man?

864
01:26:16,278 --> 01:26:18,075
Jeannot is working on it.

865
01:26:20,282 --> 01:26:23,843
Tell him to hurry it up.
I'm bored to hell here.

866
01:26:23,952 --> 01:26:25,749
It's time I left France.

867
01:26:27,489 --> 01:26:28,456
Bring a paper?

868
01:26:39,801 --> 01:26:41,268
Damn.

869
01:26:41,837 --> 01:26:43,464
If the government
would get off my back,

870
01:26:43,572 --> 01:26:46,405
I'd give the jerks more
than a strike to worry about.

871
01:27:16,605 --> 01:27:18,573
- Is the chief out?
- Still in Lyon.

872
01:27:19,441 --> 01:27:21,705
He'll be back at noon.

873
01:27:21,810 --> 01:27:23,710
We'll have to go on without him.

874
01:27:23,812 --> 01:27:26,246
Impossible, he'll be mad.

875
01:27:26,348 --> 01:27:28,043
So he'll be mad.

876
01:27:28,150 --> 01:27:30,448
- It's now or never.
- Just a minute.

877
01:27:30,552 --> 01:27:33,180
- Did you warn the local precinct?
- No. If Buisson suspects anything,

878
01:27:33,288 --> 01:27:35,483
we won't get him alive.

879
01:27:35,590 --> 01:27:38,616
Moreover, Roubier says
he always carries a grenade

880
01:27:38,727 --> 01:27:40,524
to blow himself up if necessary.

881
01:27:40,629 --> 01:27:43,564
You're insane. We're taking a huge risk,
and we're not even covered.

882
01:27:43,665 --> 01:27:47,431
It's a rule to warn the precinct
and the chief.

883
01:27:47,536 --> 01:27:50,004
Aren't we in the service?

884
01:27:51,039 --> 01:27:53,166
I'm not forcing you to come.

885
01:28:05,587 --> 01:28:07,418
- Alfonse.
- Inspector?

886
01:28:08,123 --> 01:28:10,250
- Put that on the chief's desk.
- Right away.

887
01:28:12,761 --> 01:28:16,060
- Asked for a car?
- A special one is waiting.

888
01:29:00,075 --> 01:29:01,542
You all right?

889
01:29:20,762 --> 01:29:22,389
Fill her up, please.

890
01:29:23,431 --> 01:29:25,558
Roger, the other side.

891
01:30:17,986 --> 01:30:21,183
- Can we eat here?
- Yes, sir. We have a restaurant.

892
01:30:21,289 --> 01:30:22,586
Great!

893
01:30:24,125 --> 01:30:25,592
We'll lunch here.

894
01:30:25,694 --> 01:30:27,958
We can be at the clinic at 4:00.

895
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:34,661
- May I park here?
- Of course, sir.

896
01:31:31,926 --> 01:31:35,384
"Lunching with Buisson at the hotel.

897
01:31:36,164 --> 01:31:40,658
Come for coffee.
Respectfully, Borniche."

898
01:31:41,369 --> 01:31:42,836
Good God!

899
01:32:09,130 --> 01:32:10,597
What's he doing?

900
01:32:11,299 --> 01:32:12,766
Looking at the car.

901
01:32:12,867 --> 01:32:15,665
He can take it.
I have a plug.

902
01:32:18,907 --> 01:32:20,101
You all right?

903
01:32:20,208 --> 01:32:22,335
Going crazy, but I'm fine.

904
01:32:27,716 --> 01:32:29,843
The table is ready.

905
01:32:32,487 --> 01:32:34,648
- Take your pick.
- Over there.

906
01:32:36,958 --> 01:32:38,425
Here are the menus.

907
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:40,928
I recommend the chicken, a specialty.

908
01:32:41,029 --> 01:32:43,497
The chicken will be great.
Bring hors d'oeuvres first.

909
01:32:43,598 --> 01:32:46,499
- For me too.
- No, thanks.

910
01:32:46,601 --> 01:32:49,536
I'll bring the hors d'oeuvres
and a bottle of the local wine.

911
01:32:49,637 --> 01:32:51,104
Yeah, thanks.

912
01:33:08,790 --> 01:33:11,418
"Music soothes the savage beast."

913
01:34:07,449 --> 01:34:08,473
You play well.

914
01:34:10,785 --> 01:34:13,345
Little things, not Chopin.

915
01:34:14,556 --> 01:34:16,319
I like things like that better.

916
01:34:18,693 --> 01:34:20,217
Know any other Edith Piaf?

917
01:34:48,990 --> 01:34:50,457
Here you are.

918
01:34:51,993 --> 01:34:53,790
Have you decided, sir?

919
01:34:54,496 --> 01:34:55,963
Chicken.

920
01:34:57,499 --> 01:34:59,967
Come and eat, Catherine.
We're late.

921
01:35:04,272 --> 01:35:05,739
Thank you, miss.

922
01:35:11,479 --> 01:35:12,946
Excuse us, sir.

923
01:35:24,626 --> 01:35:26,924
You're not giving him a concert.

924
01:35:28,630 --> 01:35:30,427
He's got nice eyes.

925
01:35:33,468 --> 01:35:36,665
He's about to move in, Roger.

926
01:35:36,771 --> 01:35:38,398
Go ahead, laugh.

927
01:35:38,506 --> 01:35:40,303
May I eat, ma'am?

928
01:35:44,312 --> 01:35:46,940
- He's coming back.
- Eat and don't turn around.

929
01:35:55,256 --> 01:35:58,225
<i>I think Le Caporal Epinglé
should have won the Goncourt.</i>

930
01:35:58,927 --> 01:36:00,394
Read it?

931
01:36:02,931 --> 01:36:04,660
Not much time to read

932
01:36:04,766 --> 01:36:07,360
with all these strikes.

933
01:36:07,468 --> 01:36:10,596
Literary awards
are fixed by publishers.

934
01:36:10,705 --> 01:36:12,104
How about some wine?

935
01:36:19,113 --> 01:36:21,047
Excuse me, I forgot.

936
01:36:31,759 --> 01:36:33,226
Excuse me.

937
01:36:39,801 --> 01:36:41,769
Better call the clinic.

938
01:36:43,171 --> 01:36:44,638
Yes, perhaps.

939
01:36:45,807 --> 01:36:50,710
- Can we call Rambouillet?
- Of course. What number?

940
01:36:50,812 --> 01:36:53,645
- 43 2.
- 43 2 Rambouillet.

941
01:37:13,267 --> 01:37:16,134
Hello, miss.
Mother Goose Inn here.

942
01:37:16,237 --> 01:37:19,035
Rambouillet 43 2, please.

943
01:37:25,780 --> 01:37:27,748
Hope you enjoy it.

944
01:37:32,654 --> 01:37:33,643
Really?

945
01:37:34,589 --> 01:37:35,920
Hold on a minute.

946
01:37:36,024 --> 01:37:38,117
That number doesn't exist.

947
01:37:42,397 --> 01:37:43,591
What?

948
01:37:47,301 --> 01:37:49,462
It's the Ambroise Paré Clinic.

949
01:37:49,570 --> 01:37:50,867
Wait.

950
01:37:50,972 --> 01:37:53,202
Is this the Ambroise Paré Clinic?

951
01:37:53,307 --> 01:37:56,037
- She make a mistake?
- Ambroise Paré?

952
01:37:56,744 --> 01:37:58,371
Mrs. Mercier?

953
01:37:59,714 --> 01:38:01,181
Dr. Le Garrec here.

954
01:38:04,419 --> 01:38:06,410
We're a little late.

955
01:38:07,989 --> 01:38:10,457
Tell the boss I'll be there at 4:00.

956
01:38:12,326 --> 01:38:14,123
We're on our way.

957
01:38:15,263 --> 01:38:16,287
Yes.

958
01:38:17,331 --> 01:38:18,958
Fine, Mrs. Mercier.

959
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:20,967
See you later.

960
01:38:28,276 --> 01:38:30,744
- How's the chicken coming?
- It's coming up.

961
01:38:30,845 --> 01:38:32,972
Taste it.
It's her specialty.

962
01:38:33,081 --> 01:38:35,709
- Some bread, please.
- Oh, yeah. Coming.

963
01:38:39,921 --> 01:38:41,855
Excuse me, my wife forgot.

964
01:38:41,956 --> 01:38:43,753
- Everything all right?
- Great.

965
01:38:54,902 --> 01:38:56,529
It's over, Emile!

966
01:38:58,506 --> 01:38:59,803
The grenade! Good God!

967
01:39:51,292 --> 01:39:54,090
<i>What followed is routine police work. </i>

968
01:39:54,796 --> 01:39:56,696
<i>Buisson imprisoned in the Santé. </i>

969
01:39:56,798 --> 01:40:00,757
<i>I questioned him before
a special commission. </i>

970
01:40:01,302 --> 01:40:04,931
<i>Twice a week,
I picked him up in a station car, </i>

971
01:40:05,039 --> 01:40:07,303
<i>early in the morning. </i>

972
01:40:09,310 --> 01:40:11,608
- Morning, Mr. Borniche.
- Hi, Emile.

973
01:40:12,647 --> 01:40:15,013
<i>Little by little,
certainly not on purpose, </i>

974
01:40:15,116 --> 01:40:18,176
<i>something strange
happened between us. </i>

975
01:40:18,719 --> 01:40:22,849
<i>Friendship would be a big word,
but we became pals. </i>

976
01:40:23,558 --> 01:40:25,355
<i>We nearly understood one another, </i>

977
01:40:25,459 --> 01:40:28,087
<i>especially when talking
about the weather. </i>

978
01:41:18,813 --> 01:41:21,281
- Come back for him at 6:00.
- Very well.

979
01:41:46,574 --> 01:41:48,872
<i>So Emile would sit down. </i>

980
01:41:49,710 --> 01:41:52,474
<i>With his free hand,
he'd pour himself a glass of Bordeaux. </i>

981
01:41:53,180 --> 01:41:55,478
<i>I bought him a bottle of it. </i>

982
01:42:03,357 --> 01:42:08,659
<i>He'd take out his thick glasses
and read the Figaro on the table. </i>

983
01:42:22,743 --> 01:42:24,074
<i>It was 11:00.</i>

984
01:42:24,178 --> 01:42:26,476
<i>I wouldn't question him till 12:30.</i>

985
01:42:28,816 --> 01:42:31,785
<i>I'd go over the reports.
A moment of peace. </i>

986
01:42:32,453 --> 01:42:34,921
<i>Emile, just the news. </i>

987
01:42:42,330 --> 01:42:45,299
<i>Why do you always
read the Figaro? </i>

988
01:42:45,399 --> 01:42:47,060
Habit.

989
01:42:47,601 --> 01:42:51,037
<i>On the run, no one suspects a guy
reading the Figaro.  It's too serious.</i>

990
01:42:51,138 --> 01:42:54,073
<i>At 2:00, serious work begins. </i>

991
01:42:54,442 --> 01:42:58,640
<i>The stack of files on Mr. Emile
were almost five feet high. </i>

992
01:42:59,347 --> 01:43:01,907
<i>He was charged with
36 murders and holdups. </i>

993
01:43:02,016 --> 01:43:03,483
<i>They threw the book at him. </i>

994
01:43:03,584 --> 01:43:07,213
<i>But I had to go through all of it
to separate truth from falsehood. </i>

995
01:43:07,922 --> 01:43:10,823
<i>Emile confessed to everything
except for the killings. </i>

996
01:43:10,925 --> 01:43:13,485
<i>But I had condemning evidence, </i>

997
01:43:13,594 --> 01:43:15,221
<i>unshakable witnesses, </i>

998
01:43:15,329 --> 01:43:19,322
<i>and the P.38 business
weighed heavily against him. </i>

999
01:43:27,308 --> 01:43:28,468
Shall we start?

1000
01:43:30,011 --> 01:43:31,808
Let's start, Mr. Borniche.

1001
01:43:36,484 --> 01:43:38,611
<i>Our meetings went on for over a year. </i>

1002
01:43:39,653 --> 01:43:42,781
<i>Only once did the real Buisson show. </i>

1003
01:43:43,657 --> 01:43:47,616
<i>The day we talked about Paul Roubier,
Paulo the Bomber. </i>

1004
01:43:56,003 --> 01:43:57,994
That guy, Mr. Borniche,

1005
01:43:59,974 --> 01:44:02,602
I'd like to take a handsaw
to his throat...

1006
01:44:05,980 --> 01:44:08,471
and stop from time to time
to hear him scream.

1007
01:44:18,793 --> 01:44:20,590
I'm afraid you won't get the chance.

1008
01:44:22,029 --> 01:44:22,996
Yeah.

1009
01:44:33,140 --> 01:44:34,835
Too bad.

1010
01:44:42,016 --> 01:44:46,453
<i>I sat in silence watching Buisson, </i>

1011
01:44:46,554 --> 01:44:48,044
<i>motionless in his chair, </i>

1012
01:44:48,155 --> 01:44:50,248
<i>his right arm hanging in the cuffs. </i>

1013
01:44:52,626 --> 01:44:57,086
<i>I thought to myself,
"Emile has guts. "</i>

1014
01:45:19,620 --> 01:45:22,180
Condemned to death
by the Seine High Court,

1015
01:45:22,289 --> 01:45:25,747
Emile Buisson was executed
on February 28, 1956.
