1
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,640
The name's Roger Borniche,

2
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,320
Inspector with the Federal Police.

3
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,920
I'm a cop.

4
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,360
I love this goddamn profession.

5
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,080
But this morning, I'd rather
have stayed in bed with Catherine.

6
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,560
She wants to get married,
make it legal.

7
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,440
But I've got to become
chief investigator first.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,720
I'm already doing the job.

9
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,880
I'm only lacking the title...

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,640
and the salary.

11
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,800
I've solved some major cases
since I've been in this joint.

12
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,360
The boss can't deny that.

13
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,920
But that particular morning,

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,120
I had no idea what was about to pop up.

15
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,680
Hi, Borniche.

16
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,520
Morning, Roger.

17
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,200
Well?

18
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,480
Well, nothing.

19
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,320
He's talking nonsense.

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,040
Leave me alone with him.

21
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,720
If you're so smart...

22
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,160
I'd like to believe you, Raymond.

23
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,560
I always tell the truth.

24
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,200
So the day of the shooting,
the 17 th, you weren't in Paris.

25
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,800
You were in Rouen.

26
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,760
At my brother-in-law's.
He'll confirm it.

27
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,600
They say they saw me in my bar,
but they were outside.

28
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,040
They're obviously wrong.

29
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,360
Or they want you to do wrong.
I don't doubt it.

30
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,920
Then why did your pals beat me up?

31
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,600
They're impulsive.

32
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,440
You too, sometimes.

33
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:55,320
Not on the 17th,
but on the 16th, 20th or 22nd.

34
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,440
All right.

35
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,480
I'm magnanimous.
I'll release you.

36
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,960
- What for?
- You give Lieutenant Clot information.

37
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,800
Why not let me have it first?

38
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,680
But I'm not an informer!

39
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,840
I could name some of the guys
you've brought down.

40
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,360
Scumbags who worked for the Gestapo.

41
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,920
That's different.

42
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,280
You should've been decorated.

43
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,760
Right. I'll be right there.

44
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,400
Make up your mind.
I'm going to see the boss.

45
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,120
That'll give you some time
to think it over.

46
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,800
- Keep an eye on that guy.
- Sure, Roger.

47
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,360
Come in.

48
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,920
Buisson has escaped.

49
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,720
Buisson?
Never heard of him.

50
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,400
You weren't here
when he earned his stripes.

51
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,280
Fine list of holdups.

52
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,760
The Troyees Bank before the war.

53
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,400
In '42, the Victory Street holdup,
a cashier shot.

54
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,840
I want you to get Buisson
before Central does.

55
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,000
We'll show Clot
that the Federal Police exist,

56
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,760
that Central doesn't have
a monopoly on criminal cases.

57
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:51,920
Careful.
Mr. Emile shoots fast and straight.

58
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,040
Does that appeal to you?

59
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,320
If not, I'd be a salesman.

60
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,880
Go on, get your informers competing.

61
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,440
By the way,
I'd like to release Pelletier.

62
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,040
That's going too far.

63
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,120
The Spaniard was shot
coming out of his bar.

64
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,880
His Rouen alibi will hold.

65
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,520
I think he has a deal with Clot.

66
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,720
How about we cut in?

67
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,120
That's what I like to hear.

68
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,680
- It's up to you.
- I know.

69
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,520
Make Buisson a priority.
Get his file from the archives.

70
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,840
If you pull this off,

71
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,400
I promise you'll make
chief investigator this time.

72
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,560
Say, guys.

73
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,560
The name Buisson
mean anything to you?

74
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,080
The gangster who
broke out of Villejuif?

75
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,720
The chief wants us to get him.

76
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,680
Archives, please.

77
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,280
- What about Raymond?
- We let him go.

78
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,960
Speaking of which,

79
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,040
I don't much like your methods.

80
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,080
Want me to offer him a candy bar?

81
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,920
That's an idea.

82
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,080
Roblin? Borniche here.

83
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,640
Could I have Buisson's file?

84
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,280
Emile Buisson.

85
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,840
Thanks, I'll send Darros.

86
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,000
So, it's a deal.

87
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,040
A deal?

88
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,960
I didn't agree to anything.

89
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,440
If you don't agree,

90
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,520
I'll make sure it gets around
that you inform for Clot.

91
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,320
You must take me for a bitch.

92
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,560
That's why I'm giving you
my phone number.

93
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,760
I'm a pervert.

94
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,760
I love bitches.

95
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,960
Anvers.

96
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,360
My bar, can I open it?

97
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,920
Of course.

98
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,280
If a certain Buisson ever stops by
for a drink, give me a call.

99
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,400
Buisson? Are you crazy?

100
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,600
You know him?

101
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,720
Seen him around,
like lots of others.

102
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,640
Thought he was still in the can.

103
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,040
He got out
on good behaviour.

104
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,360
My brother, Emile.
This is Suzanne.

105
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,520
René's sister.

106
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,440
She was Pete the Saint's girl.

107
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,840
Cops shot him
during the Marseilles holdup.

108
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,320
I know.

109
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,440
We'll stay here for a while.

110
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,680
In any case, I can't go home.
The cops must be there.

111
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,120
They'll check the files.

112
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,040
- The driver?
- Mario the Wop?

113
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,200
He's dumping the car.
Don't worry. He's solid.

114
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,480
When Mario comes back,
have him find another.

115
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,600
Do we need one just yet?

116
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,680
Suzanne, no errands to run?

117
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,840
Bring back the evening paper.

118
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,480
Got a change of clothes?

119
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,840
I want to go dancing this afternoon.

120
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,120
Can't that wait?

121
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,160
I hate to keep squealers waiting.

122
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,480
Cheers.

123
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,440
Hello, baby cop.

124
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,000
Hello, big girl.

125
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,840
A good day?

126
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,280
Hectic.

127
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,840
Bernier was out.
I had to answer the phone.

128
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,520
A long wait for the bus.

129
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,480
No waiting on the subway.

130
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,120
Roger, I have the car for Sunday.

131
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,120
The Talbot? Fantastic.

132
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,400
I saw father at noon.
He gave in.

133
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,200
It's hard to resist you.

134
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,720
If you'd been my daughter,
I would've made a very bad father.

135
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,360
What are we doing tonight?

136
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,440
Nothing. I've got to read
these files for tomorrow.

137
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,600
Excuse me.

138
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,160
Devil in the Flesh is playing.

139
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,000
You promised we'd see it.

140
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,240
We'll go next week.
It'll play for a while.

141
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,040
Why don't you change careers?

142
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,400
Your attorney boss needs clients.

143
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,640
This the guy who escaped?

144
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,680
Yes, that's him.

145
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,880
He crazy?

146
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,360
He acts like it 'cause it's easier
to get out of madhouses than prisons.

147
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,200
Is he dangerous?

148
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,800
Very.

149
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,320
Probably because of his
unhappy childhood.

150
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,080
His alcoholic father
made him steal food for them.

151
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,960
That doesn't make for a saint.

152
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,440
He's at the point of no return.

153
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,800
All we can do for him

154
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,920
is keep him from killing
to save his neck.

155
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,360
You should've been an attorney.

156
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,640
Maybe.

157
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,040
Borniche, Federal Police.

158
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,640
- Jean-Baptiste Buisson's file, please.
- Emile's brother?

159
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,640
Everyone wants that one today.

160
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,320
First row.

161
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,240
May I help you, gentlemen?

162
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,960
Hands up.

163
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,560
Everyone up!

164
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,400
Come on, hands up!

165
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,560
Bastards!

166
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,520
Put the dough on the table.

167
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,480
Jewels, lighters, everything.

168
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,280
Quick!

169
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,240
Come on.

170
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,920
Earrings.

171
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,080
The ring.

172
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,280
Now!

173
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,240
Don't move!

174
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,560
The cops.

175
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,840
- You okay?
- Yes, fine. Get moving.

176
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,200
Be careful, they shot at me.

177
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,680
Stop!

178
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,360
Mado, open up.

179
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,520
Is your man here?

180
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,120
- What's the matter?
- We need to stay a minute.

181
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,840
It's stormy outside.

182
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,120
Good to see you, Raymond.

183
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,840
I'll be damned!

184
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,640
I wasn't expecting -

185
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,080
Can I wash up?

186
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,400
Go right ahead.
There's water at the bar.

187
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,480
We'll go to the back room.

188
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,400
You haven't changed in five years.

189
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,000
That's a load.

190
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,480
Grandma's inheritance.
We want top price.

191
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,160
All right.
I'll see the Armenian tomorrow.

192
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,920
You know his terms?

193
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,000
You'll get your cut,
but be quick.

194
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,840
Thursday good?

195
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,840
Deal.

196
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,760
- 4:00.
- Fine.

197
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,840
Mado, bring us a bottle.

198
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,160
"Officer Schmitt Dies
as Result of Injuries."

199
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,240
That's pure Buisson.

200
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,120
Description fits.

201
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,680
That's his style.

202
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:19,000
The guy escapes,
forms a new team,

203
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,960
and he's back in business.

204
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,960
He doesn't waste any time.

205
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,520
Unlike you.

206
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,400
You're not getting anywhere.

207
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,680
How can I get him in a week?

208
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,280
- The press says you're a super cop.
- I could do without the press.

209
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,200
Listen up.
Just get moving.

210
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,520
Central will spare no effort.

211
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,880
What exactly are you doing?

212
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,480
Aside from smoking
one cigarette after another?

213
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,320
Watching his brother's place.

214
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,200
Central's guys are there already.
Find something else.

215
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,600
I'm looking, Chief.

216
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,600
Phone. Raymond Pelletier.

217
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,200
Will only talk to you.

218
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,080
Inspector?

219
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,840
It's about your friend.

220
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,640
What friend?

221
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,880
The one who's out
on good behaviour.

222
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,040
Oh, I get you. Well?

223
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,640
A man will come to my bar
at 4:00 on Thursday.

224
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,000
Just follow him,

225
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,120
and he'll lead you to the right place.

226
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,640
Fine. Thanks.

227
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,560
There he goes.

228
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,000
Let's go.

229
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,320
We've met.

230
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,160
- Where do you live?
- Paris.

231
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,280
That's where I've seen you.

232
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,440
DÉSIRÉE STREET

233
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,240
May I use the phone?

234
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,120
Give me a coffee.

235
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,840
In Marseilles.

236
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,840
With my uncle.

237
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,800
Hidoine just called.
Join him with the chief.

238
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,520
Here's the address.

239
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,440
I hope he'll confirm that.

240
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,360
If not, we'll have to
have a little talk.

241
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,400
- He's here.
- Where?

242
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,920
You watch Désirée Street,
first on the left.

243
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,840
I followed Jean-Baptiste Buisson here.

244
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,880
He went into the building
at 8, Désirée Street.

245
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,560
I'll stay with Hidoine and Darros.

246
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,080
When we know exactly
where they live, I'll arrest them.

247
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,840
By yourself, Dick Tracy?

248
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,800
The local precinct will help.

249
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,760
Got it.

250
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,320
But if you lose Buisson,
I'll send you south after chicken thieves.

251
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,320
I know.

252
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,960
Robert, here's some food.

253
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,200
A beer, the other's for Darros.

254
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,520
Go easy on it.

255
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,600
Get lost!

256
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,640
- Here. Dying of hunger?
- Just about.

257
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,480
Leave a little beer for me.

258
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,920
Now what?

259
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,280
It's too early to move in.

260
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,360
What about those guys?

261
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,120
Do they wait for dawn
to kill everyone?

262
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,240
Goddamn!

263
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,960
Hey, the cops!

264
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,920
Cut the crap.

265
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,320
Get up!

266
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,200
Emile, the cops! Quick!

267
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,080
They tipped us off.

268
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,880
Go upstairs and get out
by the roof. Hurry.

269
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,800
I'll see if it's clear.

270
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,800
Quick, get out!

271
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,080
Stop! Police!

272
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,640
Goddamn!

273
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,960
The ambulance is coming.

274
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,240
- Hello, Germaine.
- Morning, Chief.

275
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,280
Hey, Borniche.

276
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:27,400
For a former paratrooper,
you're not much of a jumper.

277
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,480
Chief, please.

278
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:32,560
If you'd pulled it off,
this mess with Central wouldn't matter.

279
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:36,200
Clot claims he'd laid a trap for Buisson
and that we fouled it up.

280
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,200
- Clot can go and -
- But in the mean time,

281
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,360
we're in it up to our neck.

282
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,480
Chief, we have Buisson's
brother and accomplice.

283
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,160
- What is it?
- Still nothing.

284
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:48,200
We're searching the area
room by room.

285
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,320
That's it.

286
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,160
- See? Still nothing.
- So?

287
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,520
The brother will need
a month in the hospital.

288
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,760
- And the girl?
- She won't talk. She's a real lioness.

289
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,120
I have a meeting
with the director at 2:00.

290
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,120
You know what that means?

291
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,760
Give me a detailed report.

292
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,560
Who's calling?

293
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,200
Catherine.

294
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,600
I'm fine. Who told you that?

295
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,520
A pack of lies!

296
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,320
Roger, why are you
talking to me like that?

297
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,040
I know. I'm sorry-

298
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,600
Forgive me.

299
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,040
Really, I can't tell you.

300
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,000
I'll try to get free.

301
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,720
I'll do my best.

302
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,720
That's it.

303
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,320
I'll call this evening.

304
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,560
Yes.

305
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,800
Yeah, love you too.

306
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,520
But you don't understand.

307
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:26,600
Three or four days
while I get him a room.

308
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,440
Thanks.

309
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,960
I've found a room in the suburbs.

310
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,640
An old friend.

311
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,200
When you see the Wop,
give him the address.

312
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,040
Tell him to bring a Colt.45.

313
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,240
Okay.

314
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,920
My God. You've had it, Bollec.

315
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:01,040
I'll see you guillotined
together with the Buissons.

316
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,560
I'll bust your balls.

317
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,240
You'll never use them again, you swine.

318
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,840
Never again!

319
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,640
So that wasn't Emile Buisson with you?

320
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,120
It was -
What was his name?

321
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,360
Repeat your bullshit.

322
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,280
Repeat it!

323
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,160
George Muller!

324
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,200
That's the name I knew him by.

325
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,600
I'll make you eat your own shit,
you bastard,

326
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,000
if you go on taking me for a jerk!

327
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,920
You're not in the slammer yet, buddy.

328
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,760
He says the guy on the roof
wasn't Buisson.

329
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,840
Interesting.

330
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:22,800
We'll see if your statement
matches your sister's.

331
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,360
Then we'll have a talk.

332
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,840
You got a minute, Lucien?

333
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,120
Now what is it?

334
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,640
You know.

335
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,960
Want me to give gifts
to a guy who kills a cop?

336
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,360
Maybe it wasn't him.

337
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,800
You can do your job without that.

338
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,160
Roger, you're starting
to get on our nerves.

339
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,320
You act important,
but you're not the boss.

340
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,440
Guys like that are vermin.

341
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,920
And vermin are for squashing, get it?

342
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,400
If it had been your brother
or father that got gunned down,

343
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,960
maybe you'd see it differently.

344
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,200
- You think?
- Yes, I'm sure.

345
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:31,040
Deep down,
you're nothing but an amateur.

346
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,880
Let me tell you a story, Lucien.

347
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
A story I never tell.

348
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,840
Suppose I had a brother.

349
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,880
A guy I loved a lot.

350
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,720
In '44, the Lauriston Street
Gestapo got him.

351
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,920
You catch my drift?

352
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,400
They were so "nice" to him
that he died.

353
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,680
Don't mix things up.

354
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,520
I didn't join the force for that.

355
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,800
When I joined up,
I knew I might be killed.

356
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,320
But I knew that being a cop
doesn't put you above the law!

357
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,040
Using certain methods...

358
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,720
puts you lower down
than your so-called vermin.

359
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,800
Have you sent
Hollec's P.38 to the lab?

360
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,800
Yes.

361
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,080
- Nothing to tell me?
- I don't talk to cops.

362
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:29,280
- You prefer crooks.
- To each his own.

363
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,240
Crooks don't become a habit.

364
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,400
My guys don't have time
to dirty the sheets.

365
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,200
You'll be accused
of protecting a criminal.

366
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,160
That's rather good.

367
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,080
Buisson is a killer.
He won't hesitate to kill you.

368
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,160
Then it's normal to rat him out?

369
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,920
You had guns in your place,
and Buisson, who killed a patrolman.

370
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,880
You'll be charged
along with the rest.

371
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,280
If you like.

372
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,800
Believe me, I'm not pleased that
you'll go in for four or five years.

373
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,560
Thanks.

374
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,280
I won't insist.

375
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,280
You don't cooperate,
I'll put you inside.

376
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,280
Not bad, eh?

377
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,920
- Mind if your brother's guillotined?
- He hasn't done anything!

378
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,920
Unfortunately, he has.

379
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,080
And soon you'll have to choose
between Buisson and him.

380
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,560
Well, my colleague
will ask you some questions.

381
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:23,160
He'll note if you refuse to answer
or refuse to sign.

382
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,400
There it is.

383
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:29,080
You're in a real mess.

384
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,400
Nobody but me has
the slightest wish to save you.

385
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,680
How kind.

386
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,200
All yours.

387
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,360
Your name is Suzanne Bollec?

388
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,920
Is this gun yours?

389
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,160
You had it when we arrested you.

390
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,480
- You gonna deny that?
- I didn't use it.

391
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,840
You couldn't. It was jammed.

392
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,560
Unfortunately for you,
I have the ballistics.

393
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,880
Some bullets from your P.38...

394
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,960
were found in the body
of Alfred Thibon...

395
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,640
Freddy the Accordionist.

396
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,320
Mean anything to you?

397
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:48,080
He got taken out
on September 3,

398
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,040
the same day Emile Buisson escaped.

399
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,320
You don't waste time.

400
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,800
I had nothing to do with it.

401
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,640
But that's nothing.

402
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,680
Can't expect crooks to settle scores
with a kid's game.

403
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:14,120
But your little gun
also killed Officer Schmitt,

404
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,120
highway patrolman
and father of three.

405
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,720
Photo enlargement leaves no doubt.

406
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,480
Look at your gun.

407
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,080
It's gonna cost you, René.

408
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:35,800
It's not mine!

409
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,080
No need to shout.

410
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:43,880
I showed it to your sister.

411
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,040
She recognized it.

412
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,360
I doubt it.
She doesn't know a thing about guns.

413
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,880
Then tell me why
you had it on you.

414
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:07,360
When I was clearing out,
I took the first I found.

415
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,880
But it's not mine.

416
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,960
Then it's Emile Buisson's.

417
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,040
He wasn't with us.

418
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,680
Oh, yeah. That's right.

419
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,760
It was -
What's his name?

420
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,960
That's right, Muller.

421
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,280
So it's Muller's gun.

422
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,760
You expect me to believe that?

423
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,520
I hope you like escargot.

424
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,040
They're very good.

425
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:47,200
A police officer brings them
from the countryside.

426
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,560
It's Sunday tomorrow.

427
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,880
Shall I wake you for church,

428
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,400
Mr. Chabert?

429
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:03,000
I guess you don't like priests too much.

430
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,080
You were lucky.

431
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:48,720
Glad to see you.

432
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,480
Bring the supplies?

433
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,640
Get me a grenade.

434
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,640
A fragmentation grenade
from the army.

435
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,200
What the heck
you gonna do with that?

436
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,600
Blow up the first cop
that comes my way.

437
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:31,400
- I went to the Armenian.
- And?

438
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:33,840
Disappeared two days ago
with the stuff.

439
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,400
What you make of that?

440
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:49,040
The doctor said
not to take too long.

441
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,600
Number four.

442
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,680
I thought I smelled a pig.

443
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,840
Have a seat.

444
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,840
Good of you to come.

445
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,120
I get bored, miss my friends.

446
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,440
What's your name?

447
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:33,280
You've got the roles backwards,
Jean-Baptiste.

448
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:36,520
Why should cops
always ask the questions?

449
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,200
You the famous Borniche?

450
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,680
I hear you eat grilled gangster
for breakfast.

451
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:52,000
About the Arbois Inn
and Officer Schmitt.

452
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,720
There's little time. You're tired.

453
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:56,280
I'm fine. Stay as long as you like.

454
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:01,360
Bollec has confessed. This is routine.

455
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,120
Got a smoke?

456
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:20,520
I'll have one later
while thinking of you.

457
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,400
Thanks, kid.
Got a light?

458
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,120
The name of your guy?

459
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,440
René Bollec.

460
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:48,880
Never heard of him.

461
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:51,440
Ever hear of your brother?

462
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,800
I read he'd escaped.

463
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:59,840
I'll tell you his problem.
He was in bad company.

464
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:03,240
Otherwise, he never would've
hurt anyone, not even a cop.

465
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:06,640
I'm sure of it.

466
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:10,720
September 3, I was in Dijon.
My sister will confirm it.

467
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:14,520
Hope you have
another alibi for the court.

468
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:19,440
Borniche,
I don't want to waste your time.

469
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:22,680
I'm 52.
I'm not about to fall into your traps.

470
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,800
I know nothing.

471
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,920
I lost my memory in 1937.

472
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,480
Exactly 10 years ago.

473
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,560
Covered by the statute of limitations.

474
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:34,960
If you get that,
you got it all.

475
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,320
Leaving already?

476
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,280
I got it all.
No need for a statement.

477
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:46,280
- Here. It's the real stuff.
- Thanks, cop.

478
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,920
Deep down, you're not a bad guy.
Come back to see me.

479
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:54,240
I'll tell you all about Indochina.
It might teach you something.

480
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:56,720
I'll leave the teaching
To Judge Boissenade.

481
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,960
You'll see.
He's a very serious guy.

482
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:03,960
That's all we need, the justice system
in the hands of clowns.

483
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,560
Bye, Borniche.

484
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:14,600
If you see Emile,
say hello for me.

485
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,600
If you have time.

486
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:38,800
Hands on the bar, Raymond.

487
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,840
What's the matter, Emile?

488
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,760
Where are the jewels?

489
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:56,920
The Armenian, he's checking them.

490
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:58,920
I told your brother.

491
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,960
You know where he is?

492
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,800
Must have heard it on the radio.

493
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,640
I just came down.

494
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,880
I went to bed late.

495
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:10,920
You bastard!

496
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,720
Borniche, Federal Police.

497
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:48,280
Raymond Pelletier, the owner.
Shot behind his bar.

498
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,480
Buisson?

499
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:05,760
I was upstairs. I saw nothing.

500
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:09,680
I came down when I heard the shots.

501
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:13,280
Did he come here?

502
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,600
Did he come to see Raymond last week?

503
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:20,120
Raymond was straight.

504
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,720
It's disgusting to kill him like that.

505
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,760
Buisson's crazy.
You don't have to protect him.

506
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,680
Who was with him?

507
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,600
Leave me alone.

508
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:43,000
Isn't this enough?

509
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:46,160
Who did he come with last week?

510
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,520
His brother and...

511
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,240
And?

512
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,200
Mario.

513
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:00,800
A wop.

514
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,320
He has a woman.

515
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:07,640
She's a hooker near St. Denis.

516
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,640
Know her name?

517
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,160
Jenny.

518
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:18,160
Is that all you can tell me?

519
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,880
Isn't that enough?

520
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:25,000
She's blond, Polish.

521
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:34,160
Thanks, Mado.

522
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,520
The Polack's in a meeting.
Choose another one.

523
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:50,240
She just went up, I'll call.

524
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,480
I don't want her.

525
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,880
I want the Wop.

526
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:07,080
What? The Wop?

527
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:09,920
I'm in a hurry.

528
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,440
Perhaps you don't know Mario the Wop.

529
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:16,360
I do, but I never see him.

530
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:21,440
Do your best to see him.

531
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,760
If not, I'll have this rotten joint busted

532
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,640
I've got reasons enough
to put you in the slammer.

533
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:31,440
Like the plan?

534
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:34,760
He never comes here, I swear.

535
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:42,240
He works in the Étoile area.

536
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:47,280
You can call him at the Calanques Bar.

537
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:52,600
I knew you wanted
to help your country.

538
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:56,200
If he's really done something wrong,

539
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:58,360
it's only natural I should help a bit.

540
00:54:58,480 --> 00:54:59,920
It's only natural.

541
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:01,720
There.

542
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,840
- Evening.
- Number four.

543
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:09,800
Don't forget the tip, baby.

544
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:16,920
Go on.

545
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:54,840
Help! Robbery!

546
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,720
What's gotten into you?
You crazy?

547
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,600
Call me at the Calanques.

548
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:25,280
I'll call you at the Calanques.

549
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:53,720
I came to make your bed.

550
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,760
I didn't ask you to.

551
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:03,800
- What are you looking for?
- Nothing. Now I know who you are.

552
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:09,520
I just want to help.

553
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:17,040
Get out of here
and don't come back.

554
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:35,160
Wait at the end of the street.

555
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:42,160
- Don't be long.
- Ten minutes.

556
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:45,560
- Let's not miss the beginning.
- You'll see the movie.

557
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:12,360
Evening, Ange.

558
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,880
Evening, Inspector.

559
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,240
Give me a martini.

560
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,640
- What's wrong, Ange?
- Nothing, I'm fine.

561
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:34,360
You don't look it.

562
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:37,800
A little nauseous.
I must've eaten something bad.

563
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:40,760
Take care of your health, Ange.

564
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:44,920
We'd hate to lose you.

565
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:57,240
Know him?

566
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,400
An Italian.

567
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:04,000
I'm told he comes here.

568
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,160
You were told wrong, Inspector.

569
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:14,840
Evil gossip.

570
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:17,080
The Italian do anything wrong?

571
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:20,960
Think about it. When we want someone,
it's for his own good.

572
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,400
That's true.

573
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:27,880
No, you'll offend me.

574
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,400
Then I'll offend you.

575
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,040
See you soon, Ange.

576
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:38,040
Night.

577
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:01,240
You know who just left?

578
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:03,520
A cop.

579
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:06,360
Not just any cop,
Inspector Borniche.

580
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:10,880
What did he want?

581
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:13,880
To know if Mario came here.

582
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:16,360
That's interesting.

583
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:23,360
Damn.

584
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:25,800
I was scared.

585
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:28,760
You should've told me.

586
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:31,600
I would have shot your buddy.

587
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:45,040
Bullets from the same Colt 45.

588
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:48,080
Well?

589
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:52,080
The same gun killed Pelletier
and the bank collector.

590
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:53,640
Buisson again.

591
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:59,040
They want you to listen to the tapes.

592
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:01,480
I had the phone
in the Calanques Bar tapped.

593
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:04,280
A friend of Buisson's receives calls there.
You never know.

594
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:06,440
Thanks, Mr. Legal.

595
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:17,560
What weather.

596
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:19,480
All we need is snow.

597
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,120
Got another recording.

598
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,840
Somebody called for Mario.

599
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,160
It must be Buisson.

600
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:32,280
Don't come. I've moved.

601
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:35,040
What time tomorrow?

602
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:37,680
5:00 in Vincennes Forest,
Champigny Highway.

603
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:39,880
Where exactly?

604
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,880
The Fourchette,
behind the yellow cabin.

605
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:44,840
- What car?
- A black Simca 1000.

606
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:46,280
Bye, Mario. See you tomorrow.

607
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:01,080
Roger, he's leaving.

608
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:05,560
Let him go.

609
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:07,680
We'll get him at the Calanques.

610
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,320
If he sees he's followed, it's over.

611
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:12,840
I'll never get it.

612
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:14,640
Bust our ass to catch guys,

613
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:17,240
and once we get them,
we let them go.

614
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:29,720
I waited over an hour.

615
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:33,400
It's odd he didn't show up.

616
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:37,680
He changes his mind sometimes.

617
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:41,600
Put yourself in his shoes.
On the run, you get wary.

618
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:46,240
We should visit the factory
in St. Denis.

619
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:51,400
There's no time to loose.
Payday is Tuesday.

620
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:53,120
Yes, it's urgent.

621
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:04,520
Gentlemen.

622
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:26,880
Hello.

623
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,640
Jeannot, the friend I told you about
for the next job.

624
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:43,080
I don't get it, Emile.

625
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:44,960
About the meeting?

626
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:47,920
I'll explain later.

627
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,560
- Miss.
- Coming.

628
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:53,720
My treat.

629
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:56,920
Looks like the food's good here.

630
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:58,480
Very good.

631
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:01,440
I didn't expect to see you here.

632
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:03,040
You know...

633
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:06,760
no one ever expects to see me.

634
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:09,200
Sometimes I just show up.

635
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:20,720
What does that mean, Emile?

636
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:24,800
Nothing.

637
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:27,400
I'm having a laugh.

638
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:30,080
I like to have a laugh
now and then.

639
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:34,600
Paulo said you ate here often,
so we stopped by just in case.

640
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:37,760
I'll take a pâté to start.

641
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:41,160
Me too.

642
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:56,040
Good night, gentlemen.

643
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:03,440
Come to my place for a drink?

644
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:05,400
Where's that?

645
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:08,600
Ville d'Avray. I've got a little place
on the road to Versailles.

646
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:12,480
I've got a date with a girl
when she gets off work.

647
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:14,080
She can wait.

648
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:16,280
It's good for chicks.

649
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:20,840
You can't refuse a drink.

650
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:50,040
Must be the ignition.

651
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:56,760
I'll take a leak.

652
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:59,360
Not a bad idea.

653
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:22,040
Now, Wop!

654
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:25,720
What are you doing, Emile?

655
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:29,360
Born in the Year of the Rat,
weren't you?

656
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:32,880
You crazy?

657
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:35,200
You asshole.

658
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:39,040
You keep out of this.

659
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:48,240
Paulo.

660
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:52,240
The Wop was an informer.

661
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:56,920
I didn't have time to warn you.

662
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:01,120
The cops were waiting
at the meeting spot today.

663
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:08,360
He won't be chatting
with them anymore.

664
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:57,840
Let's clear out.
Quick.

665
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:16,400
Hurry up!

666
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:20,920
Quick!

667
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:38,520
The bastard.

668
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:45,040
"Worker, Former Resistance Member,
Victim of Killer Buisson.

669
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:49,320
Our friend Guégan
gave his life for Capital.

670
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:53,200
While Mr. Jules Moch's police
are beating up miners in the north,

671
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:57,720
Emile Buisson is still on the loose,
shamelessly killing innocent workers.

672
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:00,960
What are the geniuses
at the Federal Police up to?

673
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,400
Where are these cops,

674
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:08,000
called 'supermen' by certain
members of the press corps."

675
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:09,880
That's for Borniche.

676
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:14,920
They attack Moch, he'll attack us.

677
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:17,520
Not to mention the unions.

678
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:19,600
Right now, it's a big joke.

679
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:22,440
- Where's Borniche?
- It's his day off.

680
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:24,720
I'll give him a goddamn day off!

681
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:28,000
Along with the whole bunch of you!

682
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:29,960
The Buisson case is closed!

683
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,200
I'm taking you off it.

684
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:37,440
Get me Borniche at home.

685
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:39,600
Yeah, hurry up.

686
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:48,280
Good morning.

687
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:50,160
Yes, he's here.
I'll get him.

688
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:02,600
It's for you.

689
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:04,840
- Who is it?
- The boss.

690
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:11,880
Morning, Chief.

691
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:15,240
I can't answer so fast.

692
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:17,320
You know I've done everything I could.

693
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:25,040
Okay.

694
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:29,040
As you like.

695
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:33,720
I'm more likely to get him
than Degreffe.

696
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:39,880
See you tomorrow, sir.

697
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:22,920
What was that about?

698
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:26,640
I'm off the Buisson case.

699
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:29,200
He woke you to say that?
He's insane.

700
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:32,160
He's a civil servant.

701
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:33,720
He's afraid of his superiors.

702
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:36,480
You can't let yourself
be abused like that.

703
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:48,600
Some days.

704
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:53,120
Some days what?

705
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:57,440
I'd like to be Emile Buisson.

706
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:03,040
For God's sake!

707
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:06,840
10,000 bread tickets,

708
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:09,560
as many gasoline tickets,
and you deny it?

709
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:13,640
What, the devil goes to work
in your print shop at night?

710
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:17,240
You should check my employees.

711
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:34,520
Nice work.

712
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:37,160
Come on.

713
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:39,520
Be reasonable.

714
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:42,600
If not,
we might get mad.

715
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:44,920
Come with me.

716
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:47,480
A corpse near Versailles.

717
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:49,480
The chief chose us.

718
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:52,560
How kind.

719
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:55,400
I'll leave you with him.

720
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:04,080
I advise you not to waste our time.

721
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:10,520
Didn't find much.
A settling of scores.

722
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:12,280
Let's see the face.

723
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:21,400
Come look.

724
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:23,960
Looks like the Wop.

725
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:26,120
Mario?

726
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:31,200
I'm sure of it.

727
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:33,200
I'll be damned.

728
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:36,560
How's that for luck?

729
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:38,120
You know him?

730
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:41,280
Probably know who killed him too.

731
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:51,240
That's great!

732
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:53,160
Now you interfere in our work!

733
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:54,720
Turn it down a notch.

734
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:58,040
What do you want?
Got a warrant?

735
01:15:58,160 --> 01:15:59,760
Warrant or not,
you're coming with us.

736
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:02,520
I am not!
I wasn't soliciting!

737
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:04,400
That guy your fiancé?

738
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:07,880
We're just looking for
Mario's murderer. That's all.

739
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:10,880
I don't give a damn about him!

740
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:14,040
I got nothing to do with him.
If he croaked, that's too bad.

741
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:16,400
I left him more than a year ago.

742
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:19,200
Want me to give him
a first class funeral?

743
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:21,280
Maybe you know his friends.

744
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:23,600
I know nothing!
And I've got nothing to say!

745
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:26,320
All I got to give is my ass!

746
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:28,600
That good enough for you?

747
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:31,800
Whatever you say, Jenny.
We might take you up on that.

748
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:35,120
That's it!
The pigs will send me a ham.

749
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:36,680
For Christmas.

750
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:45,960
What you laughing at, jerk?

751
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:49,840
Come to think of it,

752
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:52,920
you knew him too,

753
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:55,120
Mario the Wop?

754
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:57,400
No, not well.

755
01:16:57,960 --> 01:16:59,560
His friends?

756
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:01,360
I never saw his friends.

757
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:05,160
You never saw anyone in the bar?

758
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:07,200
No, I swear, Inspector.

759
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:15,320
Just warming up.

760
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:17,720
- My glasses.
- Don't need to see.

761
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:19,880
Just need to talk.

762
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:22,560
You skunk.

763
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:24,320
Well?

764
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:28,360
Who did Mario see?

765
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:32,520
If you got nothing to say,
we'll get you for running a whorehouse.

766
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:34,560
Your deal with the Vice Squad
won't help!

767
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:36,640
I don't know.

768
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:38,760
Sometimes he came with Paulo.

769
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:40,160
Paulo?

770
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:41,400
Paulo what?

771
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:45,000
The bomber, his wife is sick.

772
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:46,760
Syphilis?

773
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:51,200
No, TB. She's in a home.

774
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:54,360
Where does he live?

775
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:56,320
I don't know.

776
01:17:57,880 --> 01:17:59,600
It's probably in our files.

777
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:05,120
Come on.

778
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:13,680
Alias Paulo the Bomber.

779
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:17,280
Listed in the special file,
"The Fight Against Gangsters."

780
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:22,120
Paul Roubier, alias Paulo the Bomber.
Born March 29, 1904.

781
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:27,400
This might be a good lead.

782
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:31,720
- Well?
- Look.

783
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:34,280
With Buisson in '42
at the Victories Street holdup.

784
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:36,680
They got off for lack of proof.

785
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:38,400
Victories or Victory Street?

786
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:39,960
Victories.

787
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:42,320
I'll send out a wanted notice.

788
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:45,440
No, just find his wife.

789
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:47,680
What?

790
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:07,040
Don't be sad.

791
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:10,200
See you next week.

792
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:49,000
- Give me a ride to Paris, Roubier?
- What do you want?

793
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:51,240
We're not in the same club,
but we can still have a chat.

794
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:57,320
The Pacra factory is offering a million
to anyone helping to arrest the killer.

795
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:00,240
The killer is Emile Buisson.

796
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:05,160
You've worked for less.

797
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,240
Get that crooked head thinking.

798
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:14,280
What you're doing is disgusting.

799
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:19,440
If you refuse,
it'll get even more disgusting.

800
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:23,600
You need streptomycin
to save your wife.

801
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:27,280
I promise I'll get it from the States.

802
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:33,600
You gonna hesitate between
a killer like Buisson and your wife?

803
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:40,280
Another thing.

804
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:44,520
I know you were a friend of
Mario the Wop.

805
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:49,000
Emile killed him for nothing.

806
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:54,160
The Wop wasn't an informer.

807
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:56,800
Mr. Emile got that one wrong.

808
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:59,800
We'll spread the word around.

809
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:11,280
But in case you don't cooperate,

810
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:13,720
I'm sure you were
in the latest holdups.

811
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:16,920
And I'll prove it.

812
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:20,840
I'll send you up
for 15 to 20 years.

813
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:23,840
You'll never see your wife again.

814
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:37,240
I hate myself.

815
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:46,920
Me too.

816
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:49,720
But we have no choice,

817
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:53,280
either one of us.

818
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:17,400
Hi.

819
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:24,000
A tip, the Versailles tax office.

820
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:25,720
There's a pile.

821
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:28,400
- How much?
- 12 to 15 grand.

822
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:31,080
The hideout?

823
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:33,960
I found something
in the countryside, a hotel.

824
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:35,560
I know the owner.

825
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:39,840
Gotta find me a piece.

826
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:42,520
Mine's hot.
It's gotta go down the drain.

827
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:44,520
I'll find you one.

828
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:46,240
A P.38, if possible.

829
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:50,320
I always liked them.

830
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:57,480
What? A gun for Buisson?

831
01:22:58,440 --> 01:22:59,640
Are you mad, Borniche?

832
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:04,560
Do you realize what you're asking for?

833
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:06,320
A P.38,

834
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:08,080
if possible.

835
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:11,160
A P.38?

836
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,720
He prefers them.

837
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:22,880
What if we give him a Colt?
Will he throw a tantrum?

838
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:29,080
You know what his temper is like.

839
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:30,840
Listen, Borniche.

840
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:33,480
This time you've crossed the line!

841
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:37,040
You put yourself back
in charge of the Buisson case.

842
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:39,720
You invented a ridiculous story!

843
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:42,040
Excuse me, Chief.

844
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:44,600
You told me to investigate
a corpse in the Ville d'Avray.

845
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:47,240
Am I to blame
if it brought me back to Buisson?

846
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:51,080
- You kept it to yourself.
- I wanted to be sure.

847
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:53,040
That suited you.

848
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:54,080
So,

849
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:59,480
now we give Mr. Buisson
a vacation in a country hotel.

850
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:04,240
And on top of that, you want
to give him a gun to shoot us with?

851
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,280
Really.

852
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:11,920
It's become a huge joke.

853
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:14,800
I'll get Buisson a P.38.

854
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:17,840
Where, Inspector?

855
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:20,080
A souvenir of French commandos.

856
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:24,000
If anything happens,
I'll have you locked up.

857
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:26,320
Do you hear me?

858
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:28,880
Very well, sir.

859
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,760
My regards.

860
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:01,040
Here.

861
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:06,000
It wasn't easy.

862
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:15,960
Just kidding.

863
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:20,400
Your tax man?

864
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:24,880
Jeannot is working on it.

865
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:30,640
Tell him to hurry it up.
I'm bored to hell here.

866
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:32,560
It's time I left France.

867
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:35,240
Bring a paper?

868
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:48,080
Damn.

869
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:50,280
If the government
would get off my back,

870
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:53,200
I'd give the jerks more
than a strike to worry about.

871
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:25,360
- Is the chief out?
- Still in Lyon.

872
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:28,520
He'll be back at noon.

873
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:30,520
We'll have to go on without him.

874
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:33,040
Impossible, he'll be mad.

875
01:27:33,160 --> 01:27:34,840
So he'll be mad.

876
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:37,240
- It's now or never.
- Just a minute.

877
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:39,960
- Did you warn the local precinct?
- No. If Buisson suspects anything,

878
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:42,280
we won't get him alive.

879
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:45,400
Moreover, Roubier says
he always carries a grenade

880
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:47,320
to blow himself up if necessary.

881
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:50,360
You're insane. We're taking a huge risk,
and we're not even covered.

882
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:54,240
It's a rule to warn the precinct
and the chief.

883
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:56,800
Aren't we in the service?

884
01:27:57,840 --> 01:27:59,960
I'm not forcing you to come.

885
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:14,200
- Alfonse.
- Inspector?

886
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:17,040
- Put that on the chief's desk.
- Right away.

887
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:22,840
- Asked for a car?
- A special one is waiting.

888
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:08,360
You all right?

889
01:29:27,560 --> 01:29:29,200
Fill her up, please.

890
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:32,360
Roger, the other side.

891
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:28,000
- Can we eat here?
- Yes, sir. We have a restaurant.

892
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:29,400
Great!

893
01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:32,400
We'll lunch here.

894
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:34,760
We can be at the clinic at 4:00.

895
01:30:39,320 --> 01:30:41,480
- May I park here?
- Of course, sir.

896
01:31:38,720 --> 01:31:42,200
"Lunching with Buisson at the hotel.

897
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:47,440
Come for coffee.
Respectfully, Borniche."

898
01:31:48,160 --> 01:31:49,640
Good God!

899
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:17,400
What's he doing?

900
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:19,560
Looking at the car.

901
01:32:19,680 --> 01:32:22,480
He can take it.
I have a plug.

902
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:26,920
You all right?

903
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,120
Going crazy, but I'm fine.

904
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:36,640
The table is ready.

905
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:41,440
- Take your pick.
- Over there.

906
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:45,240
Here are the menus.

907
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:47,720
I recommend the chicken, a specialty.

908
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:50,280
The chicken will be great.
Bring hors d'oeuvres first.

909
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:53,280
- For me too.
- No, thanks.

910
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:56,320
I'll bring the hors d'oeuvres
and a bottle of the local wine.

911
01:32:56,440 --> 01:32:57,920
Yeah, thanks.

912
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:18,200
"Music soothes the savage beast."

913
01:34:14,240 --> 01:34:15,280
You play well.

914
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:20,160
Little things, not Chopin.

915
01:34:21,360 --> 01:34:23,120
I like things like that better.

916
01:34:25,480 --> 01:34:27,000
Know any other Edith Piaf?

917
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:57,240
Here you are.

918
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:00,600
Have you decided, sir?

919
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:02,760
Chicken.

920
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:06,760
Come and eat, Catherine.
We're late.

921
01:35:11,080 --> 01:35:12,520
Thank you, miss.

922
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:19,760
Excuse us, sir.

923
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:33,720
You're not giving him a concert.

924
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:37,240
He's got nice eyes.

925
01:35:40,280 --> 01:35:43,480
He's about to move in, Roger.

926
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:45,200
Go ahead, laugh.

927
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:47,120
May I eat, ma'am?

928
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:53,720
- He's coming back.
- Eat and don't turn around.

929
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:05,040
I think Le Caporal Epinglé
should have won the Goncourt.

930
01:36:05,720 --> 01:36:07,200
Read it?

931
01:36:09,720 --> 01:36:11,480
Not much time to read

932
01:36:11,560 --> 01:36:14,160
with all these strikes.

933
01:36:14,280 --> 01:36:17,400
Literary awards
are fixed by publishers.

934
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:18,920
How about some wine?

935
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:27,840
Excuse me, I forgot.

936
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:40,040
Excuse me.

937
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:48,560
Better call the clinic.

938
01:36:49,960 --> 01:36:51,440
Yes, perhaps.

939
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:57,520
- Can we call Rambouillet?
- Of course. What number?

940
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:00,440
- 432.
- 432 Rambouillet.

941
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:22,920
Hello, miss.
Mother Goose Inn here.

942
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:25,840
Rambouillet 432, please.

943
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:34,560
Hope you enjoy it.

944
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:40,440
Really?

945
01:37:41,400 --> 01:37:42,720
Hold on a minute.

946
01:37:42,840 --> 01:37:44,920
That number doesn't exist.

947
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:50,400
What?

948
01:37:54,120 --> 01:37:56,280
It's the Ambroise Paré Clinic.

949
01:37:56,360 --> 01:37:57,680
Wait.

950
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:00,000
Is this the Ambroise Paré Clinic?

951
01:38:00,120 --> 01:38:02,840
- She make a mistake?
- Ambroise Paré?

952
01:38:03,560 --> 01:38:05,160
Mrs. Mercier?

953
01:38:06,520 --> 01:38:08,000
Dr. Le Garrec here.

954
01:38:11,200 --> 01:38:13,200
We're a little late.

955
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:17,240
Tell the boss I'll be there at 4:00.

956
01:38:19,120 --> 01:38:20,920
We're on our way.

957
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:23,080
Yes.

958
01:38:24,120 --> 01:38:25,760
Fine, Mrs. Mercier.

959
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:27,760
See you later.

960
01:38:35,080 --> 01:38:37,560
- How's the chicken coming?
- It's coming up.

961
01:38:37,640 --> 01:38:39,760
Taste it.
It's her specialty.

962
01:38:39,880 --> 01:38:42,520
- Some bread, please.
- Oh, yeah. Coming.

963
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:48,640
Excuse me, my wife forgot.

964
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:50,560
- Everything all right?
- Great.

965
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:03,320
It's over, Emile!

966
01:39:05,320 --> 01:39:06,600
The grenade! Good God!

967
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:00,880
What followed is routine police work.

968
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:03,480
Buisson imprisoned in the Santé.

969
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:07,560
I questioned him before
a special commission.

970
01:40:08,120 --> 01:40:11,720
Twice a week,
I picked him up in a station car,

971
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:14,120
early in the morning.

972
01:40:16,120 --> 01:40:18,400
- Morning, Mr. Borniche.
- Hi, Emile.

973
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:21,800
Little by little,
certainly not on purpose,

974
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:24,960
something strange
happened between us.

975
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:29,640
Friendship would be a big word,
but we became pals.

976
01:40:30,360 --> 01:40:32,160
We nearly understood one another,

977
01:40:32,240 --> 01:40:34,880
especially when talking
about the weather.

978
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:28,080
- Come back for him at 6:00.
- Very well.

979
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:55,680
So Emile would sit down.

980
01:41:56,520 --> 01:41:59,280
With his free hand,
he'd pour himself a glass of Bordeaux.

981
01:41:59,960 --> 01:42:02,280
I bought him a bottle of it.

982
01:42:10,160 --> 01:42:15,440
He'd take out his thick glasses
and read the Figaro on the table.

983
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:30,880
It was 11:00.

984
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:33,280
I wouldn't question him till 12:30.

985
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:38,600
I'd go over the reports.
A moment of peace.

986
01:42:39,240 --> 01:42:41,720
Emile, just the news.

987
01:42:49,120 --> 01:42:52,080
Why do you always
read the Figaro?

988
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:53,840
Habit.

989
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:57,840
On the run, no one suspects a guy
reading the Figaro. It's too serious.

990
01:42:57,920 --> 01:43:00,880
At 2:00, serious work begins.

991
01:43:01,240 --> 01:43:05,440
The stack of files on Mr. Emile
were almost five feet high.

992
01:43:06,160 --> 01:43:08,720
He was charged with
36 murders and holdups.

993
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:10,280
They threw the book at him.

994
01:43:10,400 --> 01:43:14,000
But I had to go through all of it
to separate truth from falsehood.

995
01:43:14,720 --> 01:43:17,640
Emile confessed to everything
except for the killings.

996
01:43:17,720 --> 01:43:20,280
But I had condemning evidence,

997
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:22,040
unshakable witnesses,

998
01:43:22,120 --> 01:43:26,120
and the P.38 business
weighed heavily against him.

999
01:43:34,120 --> 01:43:35,280
Shall we start?

1000
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:38,600
Let's start, Mr. Borniche.

1001
01:43:43,280 --> 01:43:45,400
Our meetings went on for over a year.

1002
01:43:46,440 --> 01:43:49,600
Only once did the real Buisson show.

1003
01:43:50,440 --> 01:43:54,400
The day we talked about Paul Roubier,
Paulo the Bomber.

1004
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:04,800
That guy, Mr. Borniche,

1005
01:44:06,760 --> 01:44:09,400
I'd like to take a handsaw
to his throat...

1006
01:44:12,760 --> 01:44:15,280
and stop from time to time
to hear him scream.

1007
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:27,400
I'm afraid you won't get the chance.

1008
01:44:28,840 --> 01:44:29,800
Yeah.

1009
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:41,640
Too bad.

1010
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:53,240
I sat in silence watching Buisson,

1011
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:54,840
motionless in his chair,

1012
01:44:54,960 --> 01:44:57,040
his right arm hanging in the cuffs.

1013
01:44:59,440 --> 01:45:03,880
I thought to myself,
"Emile has guts."

1014
01:45:26,440 --> 01:45:28,960
Condemned to death
by the Seine High Court,

1015
01:45:29,080 --> 01:45:32,560
Emile Buisson was executed
on February 28, 1956.

1016
01:45:33,080 --> 01:45:37,080
