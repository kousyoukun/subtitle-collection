1
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,291
<i>The name's Roger Borniche,</i>

2
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:44,127
<i>inspector with the Federal Police. </i>

3
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:45,796
<i>I'm a cop. </i>

4
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:48,298
<i>I love this goddamn profession. </i>

5
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:51,134
<i>But this morning, I'd rather</i>
<i>have stayed in bed with Catherine. </i>

6
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:56,849
<i>She wants to get married,</i>
<i>make it legal. </i>

7
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,893
<i>But I've got to become</i>
<i>chief investigator first. </i>

8
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,271
<i>I'm already doing the job. </i>

9
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,523
<i>I'm only lacking the title... </i>

10
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,316
<i>and the salary. </i>

11
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,654
<i>I've solved some major cases</i>
<i>since I've been in this joint. </i>

12
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:12,322
<i>The boss can't deny that. </i>

13
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,035
<i>But that particular morning,</i>

14
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,371
<i>I had no idea what was about to pop up. </i>

15
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,041
Hi, Borniche.

16
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:28,088
Morning, Roger.

17
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:32,968
Well?

18
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:35,387
Well, nothing.

19
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:39,391
He's talking nonsense.

20
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:45,314
Leave me alone with him.

21
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:56,450
If you're so smart...

22
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,189
I'd like to believe you, Raymond.

23
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:29,691
I always tell the truth.

24
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:33,487
So the day of the shooting,
the 17th, you weren't in Paris.

25
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,113
You were in Rouen.

26
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:38,200
At my brother-in-law's.
He'll confirm it.

27
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:42,246
They say they saw me in my bar,
but they were outside.

28
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:44,748
They're obviously wrong.

29
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:48,210
Or they want you to do wrong.
I don't doubt it.

30
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:51,922
Then why did your pals beat me up?

31
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:54,716
They're impulsive.

32
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:57,678
You too, sometimes.

33
00:02:57,803 --> 00:03:02,808
Not on the 17th,
but on the 16th, 20th or 22nd.

34
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:06,061
All right.

35
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:09,231
I'm magnanimous.
I'll release you.

36
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:15,946
- What for?
- You give Lieutenant Clot information.

37
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:18,907
Why not let me have it first?

38
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,952
But I'm not an informer!

39
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,247
I could name some of the guys
you've brought down.

40
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:28,917
Scumbags who worked for the Gestapo.

41
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:30,544
That's different.

42
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:34,006
You should've been decorated.

43
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,933
Right. I'll be right there.

44
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:48,770
Make up your mind.
I'm going to see the boss.

45
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,608
That'll give you some time
to think it over.

46
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,701
- Keep an eye on that guy.
- Sure, Roger.

47
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:14,796
<i>Come in. </i>

48
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,723
Buisson has escaped.

49
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,685
Buisson?
Never heard of him.

50
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:33,565
You weren't here
when he earned his stripes.

51
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,567
Fine list of holdups.

52
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:38,153
The Troyees Bank before the war.

53
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:42,950
In '42, the Victory Street holdup,
a cashier shot.

54
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:51,750
I want you to get Buisson
before Central does.

55
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:56,129
We'll show Clot
that the Federal Police exist,

56
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:58,966
that Central doesn't have
a monopoly on criminal cases.

57
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:04,346
Careful.
Mr. Emile shoots fast and straight.

58
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,598
Does that appeal to you?

59
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,976
If not, I'd be a salesman.

60
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,603
Go on, get your informers competing.

61
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,273
By the way,
I'd like to release Pelletier.

62
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:16,984
That's going too far.

63
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:20,195
The Spaniard was shot
coming out of his bar.

64
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,073
His Rouen alibi will hold.

65
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:25,868
I think he has a deal with Clot.

66
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,120
How about we cut in?

67
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:31,665
That's what I like to hear.

68
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,376
- It's up to you.
- I know.

69
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:38,338
Make Buisson a priority.
Get his file from the archives.

70
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:40,757
If you pull this off,

71
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:43,427
I promise you'll make
chief investigator this time.

72
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,062
Say, guys.

73
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:56,148
The name Buisson
mean anything to you?

74
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:58,734
The gangster who
broke out of Villejuif?

75
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:01,486
The chief wants us to get him.

76
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:06,658
Archives, please.

77
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:10,412
- What about Raymond?
- We let him go.

78
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,207
Speaking of which,

79
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,418
I don't much like your methods.

80
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,587
Want me to offer him a candy bar?

81
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,591
That's an idea.

82
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,929
Roblin? Borniche here.

83
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:29,556
Could I have Buisson's file?

84
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:32,309
Emile Buisson.

85
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,020
Thanks, I'll send Darros.

86
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,614
So, it's a deal.

87
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:47,741
A deal?

88
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,701
I didn't agree to anything.

89
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,329
If you don't agree,

90
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:56,583
I'll make sure it gets around
that you inform for Clot.

91
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:01,588
You must take me for a bitch.

92
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,009
That's why I'm giving you
my phone number.

93
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:08,303
I'm a pervert.

94
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:10,389
I love bitches.

95
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:12,683
Anvers.

96
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,699
My bar, can I open it?

97
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:30,367
Of course.

98
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:34,872
If a certain Buisson ever stops by
for a drink, give me a call.

99
00:07:34,997 --> 00:07:38,125
Buisson? Are you crazy?

100
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:40,460
You know him?

101
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,715
Seen him around,
like lots of others.

102
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:48,844
Thought he was still in the can.

103
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:52,389
He got out
on good behavior.

104
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:02,543
My brother, Emile.
This is Suzanne.

105
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:05,879
René's sister.

106
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,924
She was Pete the Saint's girl.

107
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:11,426
Cops shot him
during the Marseilles holdup.

108
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:12,970
I know.

109
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,180
We'll stay here for a while.

110
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:20,602
In any case, I can't go home.
The cops must be there.

111
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,188
They'll check the files.

112
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:25,148
- The driver?
- Mario the Wop?

113
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:28,485
He's dumping the car.
Don't worry. He's solid.

114
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:50,674
When Mario comes back,
have him find another.

115
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,185
Do we need one just yet?

116
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:20,078
Suzanne, no errands to run?

117
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,631
Bring back the evening paper.

118
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:55,322
Got a change of clothes?

119
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:57,741
I want to go dancing this afternoon.

120
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,203
Can't that wait?

121
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:03,330
I hate to keep squealers waiting.

122
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:04,706
Cheers.

123
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:07,186
Hello, baby cop.

124
00:12:07,311 --> 00:12:08,812
Hello, big girl.

125
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:11,773
A good day?

126
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:13,275
Hectic.

127
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,987
Bernier was out.
I had to answer the phone.

128
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:19,781
A long wait for the bus.

129
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:21,825
No waiting on the subway.

130
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:24,578
Roger, I have the car for Sunday.

131
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,748
The Talbot? Fantastic.

132
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:33,253
I saw father at noon.
He gave in.

133
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:36,173
It's hard to resist you.

134
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:39,843
If you'd been my daughter,
I would've made a very bad father.

135
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:42,554
What are we doing tonight?

136
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:46,850
Nothing. I've got to read
these files for tomorrow.

137
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,061
Excuse me.

138
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:56,985
<i>Devil in the Flesh</i> is playing.

139
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:00,989
You promised we'd see it.

140
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:05,410
We'll go next week.
It'll play for a while.

141
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,544
Why don't you change careers?

142
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:17,005
Your attorney boss needs clients.

143
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:23,554
This the guy who escaped?

144
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,723
Yes, that's him.

145
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:28,976
He crazy?

146
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:34,731
He acts like it 'cause it's easier
to get out of madhouses than prisons.

147
00:13:34,857 --> 00:13:36,650
Is he dangerous?

148
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:38,277
Very.

149
00:13:39,862 --> 00:13:41,947
Probably because of his
unhappy childhood.

150
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:44,867
His alcoholic father
made him steal food for them.

151
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:47,828
That doesn't make for a saint.

152
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:53,584
He's at the point of no return.

153
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:56,003
All we can do for him

154
00:13:56,128 --> 00:13:59,298
is keep him from killing
to save his neck.

155
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:01,842
You should've been an attorney.

156
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:03,135
Maybe.

157
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,893
Borniche, Federal Police.

158
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:14,646
- Jean-Baptiste Buisson's file, please.
- Emile's brother?

159
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,732
Everyone wants that one today.

160
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:20,569
First row.

161
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,664
May I help you, gentlemen?

162
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:15,457
Hands up.

163
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:19,211
Everyone up!

164
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:23,215
Come on, hands up!

165
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:34,852
Bastards!

166
00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:40,023
Put the dough on the table.

167
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:42,025
Jewels, lighters, everything.

168
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:43,902
Quick!

169
00:15:57,499 --> 00:15:58,500
Come on.

170
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,253
Earrings.

171
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:22,274
The ring.

172
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:25,611
Now!

173
00:16:37,456 --> 00:16:39,166
Don't move!

174
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:55,140
The cops.

175
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,696
- You okay?
- Yes, fine. Get moving.

176
00:17:51,947 --> 00:17:54,157
Be careful, they shot at me.

177
00:18:07,004 --> 00:18:08,213
Stop!

178
00:18:58,347 --> 00:19:00,015
Mado, open up.

179
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:14,821
Is your man here?

180
00:19:20,494 --> 00:19:23,747
- What's the matter?
- We need to stay a minute.

181
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:25,582
It's stormy outside.

182
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:32,130
Good to see you, Raymond.

183
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:37,052
I'll be damned!

184
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:40,973
I wasn't expecting -

185
00:19:41,974 --> 00:19:43,517
Can I wash up?

186
00:19:43,642 --> 00:19:45,936
Go right ahead.
There's water at the bar.

187
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:54,361
We'll go to the back room.

188
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:08,876
You haven't changed in five years.

189
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:27,269
That's a load.

190
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:30,856
Grandma's inheritance.
We want top price.

191
00:20:31,607 --> 00:20:34,693
All right.
I'll see the Armenian tomorrow.

192
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:36,528
You know his terms?

193
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:40,782
You'll get your cut,
but be quick.

194
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,744
Thursday good?

195
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:45,829
Deal.

196
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:47,831
- 4:00.
- Fine.

197
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:51,043
Mado, bring us a bottle.

198
00:20:57,257 --> 00:21:00,802
"Officer Schmitt Dies
as Result of Injuries. "

199
00:21:00,886 --> 00:21:02,971
That's pure Buisson.

200
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:05,933
Description fits.

201
00:21:06,058 --> 00:21:07,601
That's his style.

202
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:11,063
The guy escapes,
forms a new team,

203
00:21:11,146 --> 00:21:13,065
and he's back in business.

204
00:21:13,649 --> 00:21:15,150
He doesn't waste any time.

205
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:16,818
Unlike you.

206
00:21:16,902 --> 00:21:18,737
You're not getting anywhere.

207
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:21,156
How can I get him in a week?

208
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,910
- The press says you're a super cop.
- I could do without the press.

209
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:27,913
Listen up.
Just get moving.

210
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:31,416
Central will spare no effort.

211
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:33,836
What exactly are you doing?

212
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:38,632
Aside from smoking
one cigarette after another?

213
00:21:40,092 --> 00:21:41,593
Watching his brother's place.

214
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:45,681
Central's guys are there already.
Find something else.

215
00:21:45,764 --> 00:21:48,183
I'm looking, Chief.

216
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:56,525
Phone. Raymond Pelletier.

217
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,151
Will only talk to you.

218
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:10,539
Inspector?

219
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:14,501
It's about your friend.

220
00:22:14,585 --> 00:22:16,378
What friend?

221
00:22:17,504 --> 00:22:19,715
The one who's out
on good behavior.

222
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:23,051
Oh, I get you. Well?

223
00:22:24,636 --> 00:22:28,891
A man will come to my bar
at 4:00 on Thursday.

224
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,310
Just follow him,

225
00:22:32,227 --> 00:22:34,605
and he'll lead you to the right place.

226
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:39,276
Fine. Thanks.

227
00:23:15,062 --> 00:23:16,772
There he goes.

228
00:23:17,648 --> 00:23:19,274
Let's go.

229
00:23:55,644 --> 00:23:57,145
We've met.

230
00:23:58,063 --> 00:24:00,107
- Where do you live?
- Paris.

231
00:24:01,525 --> 00:24:03,360
That's where I've seen you.

232
00:26:28,672 --> 00:26:30,591
DÉSI RÉE STREET

233
00:26:38,098 --> 00:26:39,766
May I use the phone?

234
00:26:39,892 --> 00:26:41,727
Give me a coffee.

235
00:26:50,194 --> 00:26:52,863
In Marseilles.

236
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,991
With my uncle.

237
00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:14,718
Hidoine just called.
Join him with the chief.

238
00:27:14,843 --> 00:27:16,553
Here's the address.

239
00:27:31,276 --> 00:27:34,196
I hope he'll confirm that.

240
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:37,199
If not, we'll have to
have a little talk.

241
00:27:57,469 --> 00:27:59,179
- He's here.
- Where?

242
00:28:00,264 --> 00:28:02,850
You watch Désirée Street,
first on the left.

243
00:28:10,607 --> 00:28:13,193
I followed Jean-Baptiste Buisson here.

244
00:28:13,277 --> 00:28:15,320
He went into the building
at 8, Désirée Street.

245
00:28:16,196 --> 00:28:18,073
I'll stay with Hidoine and Darros.

246
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:20,742
When we know exactly
where they live, I'll arrest them.

247
00:28:20,826 --> 00:28:22,536
By yourself, Dick Tracy?

248
00:28:22,661 --> 00:28:24,580
The local precinct will help.

249
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:26,665
Got it.

250
00:28:26,748 --> 00:28:31,420
But if you lose Buisson,
I'll send you south after chicken thieves.

251
00:28:31,962 --> 00:28:33,505
I know.

252
00:28:56,695 --> 00:28:59,198
Robert, here's some food.

253
00:29:00,449 --> 00:29:02,534
A beer, the other's for Darros.

254
00:29:03,285 --> 00:29:04,995
Go easy on it.

255
00:29:13,962 --> 00:29:15,506
Get lost!

256
00:29:20,636 --> 00:29:22,846
- Here. Dying of hunger?
- Just about.

257
00:29:27,976 --> 00:29:29,978
Leave a little beer for me.

258
00:29:33,482 --> 00:29:34,608
Now what?

259
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,027
It's too early to move in.

260
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,494
What about those guys?

261
00:29:45,577 --> 00:29:48,330
Do they wait for dawn
to kill everyone?

262
00:31:21,298 --> 00:31:22,299
Goddamn!

263
00:31:23,133 --> 00:31:25,177
Hey, the cops!

264
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,179
Cut the crap.

265
00:31:27,304 --> 00:31:28,680
Get up!

266
00:31:29,598 --> 00:31:31,683
Emile, the cops! Quick!

267
00:31:38,899 --> 00:31:40,943
They tipped us off.

268
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:43,862
Go upstairs and get out
by the roof. Hurry.

269
00:31:59,962 --> 00:32:01,505
I'll see if it's clear.

270
00:32:16,645 --> 00:32:18,146
Quick, get out!

271
00:32:20,566 --> 00:32:22,651
Stop! Police!

272
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:56,602
Goddamn!

273
00:33:22,503 --> 00:33:24,004
The ambulance is coming.

274
00:33:37,893 --> 00:33:39,937
- Hello, Germaine.
- Morning, Chief.

275
00:33:46,276 --> 00:33:47,277
Hey, Borniche.

276
00:33:47,402 --> 00:33:50,572
For a former paratrooper,
you're not much of a jumper.

277
00:33:50,656 --> 00:33:51,657
Chief, please.

278
00:33:51,782 --> 00:33:55,953
If you'd pulled it off,
this mess with Central wouldn't matter.

279
00:33:56,078 --> 00:33:59,748
Clot claims he'd laid a trap for Buisson
and that we fouled it up.

280
00:33:59,873 --> 00:34:01,792
- Clot can go and -
- But in the mean time,

281
00:34:01,917 --> 00:34:04,044
we're in it up to our neck.

282
00:34:04,169 --> 00:34:06,296
Chief, we have Buisson's
brother and accomplice.

283
00:34:07,548 --> 00:34:09,091
- What is it?
- Still nothing.

284
00:34:09,174 --> 00:34:12,219
We're searching the area
room by room.

285
00:34:13,303 --> 00:34:14,471
That's it.

286
00:34:14,555 --> 00:34:17,432
- See? Still nothing.
- So?

287
00:34:17,516 --> 00:34:19,893
The brother will need
a month in the hospital.

288
00:34:20,018 --> 00:34:23,272
- And the girl?
- She won't talk. She's a real lioness.

289
00:34:23,981 --> 00:34:26,733
I have a meeting
with the director at 2:00.

290
00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:28,819
You know what that means?

291
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:34,700
Give me a detailed report.

292
00:34:46,545 --> 00:34:48,088
Who's calling?

293
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:49,756
Catherine.

294
00:34:57,139 --> 00:34:59,600
I'm fine. Who told you that?

295
00:35:00,225 --> 00:35:01,560
A pack of lies!

296
00:35:01,685 --> 00:35:04,479
Roger, why are you
talking to me like that?

297
00:35:06,315 --> 00:35:08,400
I know. I'm sorry-

298
00:35:08,483 --> 00:35:10,027
Forgive me.

299
00:35:10,569 --> 00:35:13,572
Really, I can't tell you.

300
00:35:14,823 --> 00:35:16,658
I'll try to get free.

301
00:35:19,995 --> 00:35:21,622
I'll do my best.

302
00:35:22,164 --> 00:35:23,707
That's it.

303
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:26,418
I'll call this evening.

304
00:35:27,544 --> 00:35:28,754
Yes.

305
00:35:30,255 --> 00:35:32,132
Yeah, love you too.

306
00:35:48,941 --> 00:35:51,610
But you don't understand.

307
00:35:51,735 --> 00:35:54,821
Three or four days
while I get him a room.

308
00:35:57,783 --> 00:35:58,867
Thanks.

309
00:36:05,707 --> 00:36:09,837
I've found a room in the suburbs.

310
00:36:10,546 --> 00:36:11,588
An old friend.

311
00:36:11,672 --> 00:36:14,216
When you see the Wop,
give him the address.

312
00:36:14,341 --> 00:36:17,219
Tell him to bring a Colt. 45.

313
00:36:17,302 --> 00:36:18,470
Okay.

314
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:26,478
My God. You've had it, Bollec.

315
00:36:27,479 --> 00:36:30,732
I'll see you guillotined
together with the Buissons.

316
00:36:59,303 --> 00:37:01,513
I'll bust your balls.

317
00:37:01,638 --> 00:37:04,349
You'll never use them again, you swine.

318
00:37:04,474 --> 00:37:05,976
Never again!

319
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:13,066
So that wasn't Emile Buisson with you?

320
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:16,695
It was -
What was his name?

321
00:37:17,279 --> 00:37:19,072
Repeat your bullshit.

322
00:37:19,156 --> 00:37:21,033
Repeat it!

323
00:37:21,158 --> 00:37:23,035
George Muller!

324
00:37:24,328 --> 00:37:26,205
That's the name I knew him by.

325
00:37:28,373 --> 00:37:31,793
I'll make you eat your own shit,
you bastard,

326
00:37:31,919 --> 00:37:34,296
if you go on taking me for a jerk!

327
00:37:38,008 --> 00:37:40,511
You're not in the slammer yet, buddy.

328
00:37:42,971 --> 00:37:46,558
He says the guy on the roof
wasn't Buisson.

329
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,770
Interesting.

330
00:37:52,439 --> 00:37:56,026
We'll see if your statement
matches your sister's.

331
00:37:56,735 --> 00:37:58,654
Then we'll have a talk.

332
00:38:02,407 --> 00:38:04,368
You got a minute, Lucien?

333
00:38:17,756 --> 00:38:19,299
Now what is it?

334
00:38:19,842 --> 00:38:20,843
You know.

335
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:24,346
Want me to give gifts
to a guy who kills a cop?

336
00:38:24,888 --> 00:38:26,849
Maybe it wasn't him.

337
00:38:27,391 --> 00:38:29,393
You can do your job without that.

338
00:38:32,563 --> 00:38:34,940
Roger, you're starting
to get on our nerves.

339
00:38:37,109 --> 00:38:40,320
You act important,
but you're not the boss.

340
00:38:42,656 --> 00:38:44,616
Guys like that are vermin.

341
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,244
And vermin are for squashing, get it?

342
00:38:50,205 --> 00:38:53,959
If it had been your brother
or father that got gunned down,

343
00:38:54,084 --> 00:38:55,627
maybe you'd see it differently.

344
00:38:57,796 --> 00:39:00,007
- You think?
- Yes, I'm sure.

345
00:39:04,052 --> 00:39:07,181
Deep down,
you're nothing but an amateur.

346
00:39:14,146 --> 00:39:16,398
Let me tell you a story, Lucien.

347
00:39:16,481 --> 00:39:18,609
A story I never tell.

348
00:39:20,736 --> 00:39:22,613
Suppose I had a brother.

349
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,741
A guy I loved a lot.

350
00:39:26,742 --> 00:39:29,745
In '44, the Lauriston Street
Gestapo got him.

351
00:39:30,287 --> 00:39:32,080
You catch my drift?

352
00:39:32,998 --> 00:39:35,709
They were so "nice" to him
that he died.

353
00:39:35,792 --> 00:39:37,002
Don't mix things up.

354
00:39:40,005 --> 00:39:42,090
I didn't join the force for that.

355
00:39:42,674 --> 00:39:45,511
When I joined up,
I knew I might be killed.

356
00:39:46,053 --> 00:39:49,181
But I knew that being a cop
doesn't put you above the law!

357
00:40:01,318 --> 00:40:03,487
Using certain methods...

358
00:40:04,238 --> 00:40:07,324
puts you lower down
than your so-called vermin.

359
00:40:16,458 --> 00:40:19,878
Have you sent
Hollec's P.38 to the lab?

360
00:40:22,005 --> 00:40:23,006
Yes.

361
00:41:02,004 --> 00:41:05,048
- Nothing to tell me?
- I don't talk to cops.

362
00:41:07,009 --> 00:41:10,429
- You prefer crooks.
- To each his own.

363
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,515
Crooks don't become a habit.

364
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:16,810
My guys don't have time
to dirty the sheets.

365
00:41:19,605 --> 00:41:22,900
You'll be accused
of protecting a criminal.

366
00:41:22,983 --> 00:41:24,943
That's rather good.

367
00:41:26,111 --> 00:41:28,989
Buisson is a killer.
He won't hesitate to kill you.

368
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:32,201
Then it's normal to rat him out?

369
00:41:49,801 --> 00:41:53,889
You had guns in your place,
and Buisson, who killed a patrolman.

370
00:41:54,806 --> 00:41:56,934
You'll be charged
along with the rest.

371
00:41:57,059 --> 00:41:58,393
If you like.

372
00:41:59,686 --> 00:42:04,149
Believe me, I'm not pleased that
you'll go in for four or five years.

373
00:42:10,948 --> 00:42:12,241
Thanks.

374
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,461
I won't insist.

375
00:42:25,212 --> 00:42:27,589
You don't cooperate,
I'll put you inside.

376
00:42:40,686 --> 00:42:42,229
Not bad, eh?

377
00:42:46,066 --> 00:42:49,152
- Mind if your brother's guillotined?
- He hasn't done anything!

378
00:42:50,571 --> 00:42:52,281
Unfortunately, he has.

379
00:42:52,823 --> 00:42:55,576
And soon you'll have to choose
between Buisson and him.

380
00:43:00,706 --> 00:43:04,418
Well, my colleague
will ask you some questions.

381
00:43:05,419 --> 00:43:09,214
He'll note if you refuse to answer
or refuse to sign.

382
00:43:10,007 --> 00:43:11,550
There it is.

383
00:43:12,634 --> 00:43:15,345
You're in a real mess.

384
00:43:16,096 --> 00:43:18,807
Nobody but me has
the slightest wish to save you.

385
00:43:19,892 --> 00:43:21,226
How kind.

386
00:43:25,439 --> 00:43:26,940
All yours.

387
00:43:32,196 --> 00:43:34,448
Your name is Suzanne Bollec?

388
00:43:43,248 --> 00:43:45,417
Is this gun yours?

389
00:43:53,091 --> 00:43:55,052
You had it when we arrested you.

390
00:43:55,177 --> 00:43:57,513
- You gonna deny that?
- I didn't use it.

391
00:43:58,931 --> 00:44:02,017
You couldn't. It was jammed.

392
00:44:03,644 --> 00:44:05,938
Unfortunately for you,
I have the ballistics.

393
00:44:12,402 --> 00:44:14,571
Some bullets from your P.38...

394
00:44:16,031 --> 00:44:18,867
were found in the body
of Alfred Thibon...

395
00:44:20,285 --> 00:44:22,704
Freddy the Accordionist.

396
00:44:24,998 --> 00:44:27,584
Mean anything to you?

397
00:44:35,175 --> 00:44:37,719
He got taken out
on September 3,

398
00:44:37,845 --> 00:44:39,763
the same day Emile Buisson escaped.

399
00:44:42,349 --> 00:44:44,226
You don't waste time.

400
00:44:44,977 --> 00:44:46,854
I had nothing to do with it.

401
00:44:50,023 --> 00:44:51,900
But that's nothing.

402
00:44:51,984 --> 00:44:55,028
Can't expect crooks to settle scores
with a kid's game.

403
00:45:00,158 --> 00:45:04,872
But your little gun
also killed Officer Schmitt,

404
00:45:05,455 --> 00:45:08,041
highway patrolman
and father of three.

405
00:45:08,917 --> 00:45:11,795
Photo enlargement leaves no doubt.

406
00:45:17,134 --> 00:45:18,844
Look at your gun.

407
00:45:22,347 --> 00:45:24,641
It's gonna cost you, René.

408
00:45:26,518 --> 00:45:27,519
It's not mine!

409
00:45:30,105 --> 00:45:31,940
No need to shout.

410
00:45:34,735 --> 00:45:35,903
I showed it to your sister.

411
00:45:37,696 --> 00:45:39,239
She recognized it.

412
00:45:40,365 --> 00:45:42,659
I doubt it.
She doesn't know a thing about guns.

413
00:45:52,336 --> 00:45:54,671
Then tell me why
you had it on you.

414
00:45:55,756 --> 00:46:00,427
When I was clearing out,
I took the first I found.

415
00:46:01,678 --> 00:46:03,013
But it's not mine.

416
00:46:03,138 --> 00:46:05,182
Then it's Emile Buisson's.

417
00:46:07,309 --> 00:46:09,478
He wasn't with us.

418
00:46:09,561 --> 00:46:11,146
Oh, yeah. That's right.

419
00:46:11,271 --> 00:46:13,357
It was -
What's his name?

420
00:46:16,276 --> 00:46:18,737
That's right, Muller.

421
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:22,241
So it's Muller's gun.

422
00:46:24,868 --> 00:46:26,912
You expect me to believe that?

423
00:46:31,959 --> 00:46:34,962
I hope you like escargot.

424
00:46:35,087 --> 00:46:36,588
They're very good.

425
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:41,969
A police officer brings them
from the countryside.

426
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:45,430
It's Sunday tomorrow.

427
00:46:46,181 --> 00:46:48,934
Shall I wake you for church,

428
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:51,520
Mr. Chabert?

429
00:46:53,647 --> 00:46:58,402
I guess you don't like priests too much.

430
00:47:41,528 --> 00:47:43,322
You were lucky.

431
00:47:44,948 --> 00:47:46,074
Glad to see you.

432
00:47:53,457 --> 00:47:55,250
Bring the supplies?

433
00:47:58,504 --> 00:48:00,631
Get me a grenade.

434
00:48:01,173 --> 00:48:04,801
A fragmentation grenade
from the army.

435
00:48:05,385 --> 00:48:07,429
What the heck
you gonna do with that?

436
00:48:07,554 --> 00:48:10,974
Blow up the first cop
that comes my way.

437
00:48:28,367 --> 00:48:30,577
- I went to the Armenian.
- And?

438
00:48:30,702 --> 00:48:33,121
Disappeared two days ago
with the stuff.

439
00:48:33,247 --> 00:48:34,748
What you make of that?

440
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,971
The doctor said
not to take too long.

441
00:48:49,096 --> 00:48:50,639
Number four.

442
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,619
I thought I smelled a pig.

443
00:49:13,161 --> 00:49:14,872
Have a seat.

444
00:49:24,131 --> 00:49:26,300
Good of you to come.

445
00:49:26,425 --> 00:49:29,720
I get bored, miss my friends.

446
00:49:30,304 --> 00:49:32,181
What's your name?

447
00:49:33,056 --> 00:49:35,142
You've got the roles backwards,
Jean-Baptiste.

448
00:49:35,225 --> 00:49:38,478
Why should cops
always ask the questions?

449
00:49:40,814 --> 00:49:43,400
You the famous Borniche?

450
00:49:47,779 --> 00:49:50,157
I hear you eat grilled gangster
for breakfast.

451
00:49:51,909 --> 00:49:54,620
About the Arbois Inn
and Officer Schmitt.

452
00:49:54,745 --> 00:49:56,455
There's little time. You're tired.

453
00:49:56,538 --> 00:49:59,082
I'm fine. Stay as long as you like.

454
00:50:00,542 --> 00:50:04,421
Bollec has confessed. This is routine.

455
00:50:08,008 --> 00:50:09,343
Got a smoke?

456
00:50:21,522 --> 00:50:24,399
I'll have one later
while thinking of you.

457
00:50:25,108 --> 00:50:27,361
Thanks, kid.
Got a light?

458
00:50:44,962 --> 00:50:46,880
The name of your guy?

459
00:50:47,631 --> 00:50:50,384
René Bollec.

460
00:50:52,761 --> 00:50:53,971
Never heard of him.

461
00:50:55,389 --> 00:50:56,640
Ever hear of your brother?

462
00:50:58,934 --> 00:51:01,144
I read he'd escaped.

463
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:05,399
I'll tell you his problem.
He was in bad company.

464
00:51:05,524 --> 00:51:08,902
Otherwise, he never would've
hurt anyone, not even a cop.

465
00:51:11,113 --> 00:51:12,447
I'm sure of it.

466
00:51:12,573 --> 00:51:16,702
September 3, I was in Dijon.
My sister will confirm it.

467
00:51:17,828 --> 00:51:20,664
Hope you have
another alibi for the court.

468
00:51:22,749 --> 00:51:25,836
Borniche,
I don't want to waste your time.

469
00:51:25,919 --> 00:51:29,214
I'm 52.
I'm not about to fall into your traps.

470
00:51:29,298 --> 00:51:31,383
I know nothing.

471
00:51:31,508 --> 00:51:33,635
I lost my memory in 1937.

472
00:51:33,719 --> 00:51:35,262
Exactly 10 years ago.

473
00:51:35,804 --> 00:51:38,432
Covered by the statute of limitations.

474
00:51:39,016 --> 00:51:42,019
If you get that,
you got it all.

475
00:51:42,769 --> 00:51:44,479
Leaving already?

476
00:51:44,605 --> 00:51:47,524
I got it all.
No need for a statement.

477
00:51:50,819 --> 00:51:53,822
- Here. It's the real stuff.
- Thanks, cop.

478
00:51:54,531 --> 00:51:57,576
Deep down, you're not a bad guy.
Come back to see me.

479
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:02,122
I'll tell you all about Indochina.
It might teach you something.

480
00:52:02,206 --> 00:52:04,708
I'll leave the teaching
to Judge Boissenade.

481
00:52:05,375 --> 00:52:08,045
You'll see.
He's a very serious guy.

482
00:52:08,837 --> 00:52:12,257
That's all we need, the justice system
in the hands of clowns.

483
00:52:16,553 --> 00:52:18,096
Bye, Borniche.

484
00:52:19,723 --> 00:52:23,310
If you see Emile,
say hello for me.

485
00:52:30,108 --> 00:52:31,652
If you have time.

486
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,544
Hands on the bar, Raymond.

487
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:02,182
What's the matter, Emile?

488
00:53:02,266 --> 00:53:04,142
Where are the jewels?

489
00:53:04,268 --> 00:53:07,437
The Armenian, he's checking them.

490
00:53:08,021 --> 00:53:09,565
I told your brother.

491
00:53:09,648 --> 00:53:11,650
You know where he is?

492
00:53:12,734 --> 00:53:14,611
Must have heard it on the radio.

493
00:53:15,863 --> 00:53:17,573
I just came down.

494
00:53:18,365 --> 00:53:19,908
I went to bed late.

495
00:53:20,534 --> 00:53:22,077
You bastard!

496
00:53:52,149 --> 00:53:54,193
Borniche, Federal Police.

497
00:53:56,862 --> 00:54:00,991
Raymond Pelletier, the owner.
Shot behind his bar.

498
00:54:13,545 --> 00:54:15,797
Buisson?

499
00:54:15,923 --> 00:54:19,218
I was upstairs. I saw nothing.

500
00:54:20,344 --> 00:54:23,347
I came down when I heard the shots.

501
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:27,100
Did he come here?

502
00:54:27,184 --> 00:54:29,478
Did he come to see Raymond last week?

503
00:54:31,188 --> 00:54:34,233
Raymond was straight.

504
00:54:36,610 --> 00:54:38,987
It's disgusting to kill him like that.

505
00:54:45,327 --> 00:54:48,413
Buisson's crazy.
You don't have to protect him.

506
00:54:51,875 --> 00:54:53,585
Who was with him?

507
00:54:53,669 --> 00:54:55,546
Leave me alone.

508
00:54:56,338 --> 00:54:58,048
Isn't this enough?

509
00:54:58,632 --> 00:55:01,343
Who did he come with last week?

510
00:55:02,803 --> 00:55:04,888
His brother and...

511
00:55:06,682 --> 00:55:07,683
And?

512
00:55:11,854 --> 00:55:12,896
Mario.

513
00:55:15,107 --> 00:55:16,650
A wop.

514
00:55:18,569 --> 00:55:20,279
He has a woman.

515
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,782
She's a hooker near St. Denis.

516
00:55:24,324 --> 00:55:25,868
Know her name?

517
00:55:28,245 --> 00:55:29,496
Jenny.

518
00:55:33,041 --> 00:55:34,710
Is that all you can tell me?

519
00:55:34,835 --> 00:55:36,545
Isn't that enough?

520
00:55:39,047 --> 00:55:41,842
She's blond, Polish.

521
00:55:49,266 --> 00:55:51,435
Thanks, Mado.

522
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:02,196
The Polack's in a meeting.
Choose another one.

523
00:56:04,072 --> 00:56:08,202
She just went up, I'll call.

524
00:56:09,536 --> 00:56:10,537
I don't want her.

525
00:56:20,714 --> 00:56:22,424
I want the Wop.

526
00:56:24,218 --> 00:56:25,719
What? The Wop?

527
00:56:27,179 --> 00:56:28,680
I'm in a hurry.

528
00:56:28,805 --> 00:56:31,350
Perhaps you don't know Mario the Wop.

529
00:56:32,768 --> 00:56:35,395
I do, but I never see him.

530
00:56:38,732 --> 00:56:40,692
Do your best to see him.

531
00:56:41,235 --> 00:56:43,111
If not, I'll have this rotten joint busted

532
00:56:44,613 --> 00:56:48,242
I've got reasons enough
to put you in the slammer.

533
00:56:50,035 --> 00:56:51,119
Like the plan?

534
00:56:52,913 --> 00:56:54,623
He never comes here, I swear.

535
00:56:59,837 --> 00:57:02,422
He works in the Étoile area.

536
00:57:03,298 --> 00:57:07,636
You can call him at the Calanques Bar.

537
00:57:10,556 --> 00:57:13,225
I knew you wanted
to help your country.

538
00:57:13,976 --> 00:57:16,937
If he's really done something wrong,

539
00:57:17,062 --> 00:57:19,189
it's only natural I should help a bit.

540
00:57:19,314 --> 00:57:20,858
It's only natural.

541
00:57:21,733 --> 00:57:22,734
There.

542
00:57:25,821 --> 00:57:28,031
- Evening.
- Number four.

543
00:57:29,116 --> 00:57:31,159
Don't forget the tip, baby.

544
00:57:37,499 --> 00:57:38,542
Go on.

545
00:58:15,370 --> 00:58:18,123
Help! Robbery!

546
00:58:22,211 --> 00:58:24,254
What's gotten into you?
You crazy?

547
00:58:46,443 --> 00:58:48,111
Call me at the Calanques.

548
00:58:48,195 --> 00:58:49,821
I'll call you at the Calanques.

549
00:59:17,766 --> 00:59:19,476
I came to make your bed.

550
00:59:22,813 --> 00:59:24,773
I didn't ask you to.

551
00:59:25,899 --> 00:59:30,028
- What are you looking for?
- Nothing. Now I know who you are.

552
00:59:34,283 --> 00:59:35,951
I just want to help.

553
00:59:40,205 --> 00:59:43,792
Get out of here
and don't come back.

554
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:02,686
Wait at the end of the street.

555
01:00:06,982 --> 01:00:09,985
- Don't be long.
- Ten minutes.

556
01:00:10,110 --> 01:00:13,530
- Let's not miss the beginning.
- You'll see the movie.

557
01:00:39,973 --> 01:00:41,475
Evening, Ange.

558
01:00:50,901 --> 01:00:52,486
Evening, Inspector.

559
01:00:53,237 --> 01:00:54,905
Give me a martini.

560
01:00:59,785 --> 01:01:02,621
- What's wrong, Ange?
- Nothing, I'm fine.

561
01:01:02,746 --> 01:01:04,456
You don't look it.

562
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:08,043
A little nauseous.
I must've eaten something bad.

563
01:01:09,127 --> 01:01:11,088
Take care of your health, Ange.

564
01:01:12,881 --> 01:01:15,467
We'd hate to lose you.

565
01:01:26,770 --> 01:01:28,272
Know him?

566
01:01:31,108 --> 01:01:32,651
An Italian.

567
01:01:33,652 --> 01:01:35,320
I'm told he comes here.

568
01:01:37,447 --> 01:01:39,700
You were told wrong, Inspector.

569
01:01:44,955 --> 01:01:46,665
Evil gossip.

570
01:01:46,748 --> 01:01:48,959
The Italian do anything wrong?

571
01:01:49,710 --> 01:01:53,005
Think about it. When we want someone,
it's for his own good.

572
01:01:53,130 --> 01:01:54,506
That's true.

573
01:01:57,843 --> 01:02:00,220
No, you'll offend me.

574
01:02:01,305 --> 01:02:02,848
Then I'll offend you.

575
01:02:04,975 --> 01:02:06,643
See you soon, Ange.

576
01:02:09,479 --> 01:02:10,814
Night.

577
01:02:33,670 --> 01:02:35,005
You know who just left?

578
01:02:36,131 --> 01:02:37,424
A cop.

579
01:02:37,966 --> 01:02:40,385
Not just any cop,
Inspector Borniche.

580
01:02:43,347 --> 01:02:45,057
What did he want?

581
01:02:45,807 --> 01:02:48,185
To know if Mario came here.

582
01:02:49,102 --> 01:02:50,812
That's interesting.

583
01:02:57,069 --> 01:02:58,070
Damn.

584
01:02:58,820 --> 01:03:00,614
I was scared.

585
01:03:01,823 --> 01:03:03,700
You should've told me.

586
01:03:03,825 --> 01:03:06,662
I would have shot your buddy.

587
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:20,676
Bullets from the same Colt. 45.

588
01:03:22,845 --> 01:03:23,846
Well?

589
01:03:24,429 --> 01:03:28,016
The same gun killed Pelletier
and the bank collector.

590
01:03:28,141 --> 01:03:29,685
Buisson again.

591
01:03:33,272 --> 01:03:35,315
They want you to listen to the tapes.

592
01:03:35,399 --> 01:03:37,860
I had the phone
in the Calanques Bar tapped.

593
01:03:37,943 --> 01:03:40,779
A friend of Buisson's receives calls there.
You never know.

594
01:03:41,321 --> 01:03:43,031
Thanks, Mr. Legal.

595
01:03:53,208 --> 01:03:54,626
What weather.

596
01:03:54,710 --> 01:03:56,587
All we need is snow.

597
01:04:00,549 --> 01:04:02,467
Got another recording.

598
01:04:02,593 --> 01:04:04,303
Somebody called for Mario.

599
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:07,764
It must be Buisson.

600
01:04:07,890 --> 01:04:09,933
<i>Don't come. I've moved. </i>

601
01:04:11,268 --> 01:04:12,811
<i>What time tomorrow?</i>

602
01:04:12,936 --> 01:04:15,606
<i>5:00 in Vincennes Forest,</i>
<i>Champigny Highway. </i>

603
01:04:16,148 --> 01:04:17,900
<i>Where exactly?</i>

604
01:04:17,983 --> 01:04:19,943
<i>The Fourchette,</i>
<i>behind the yellow cabin. </i>

605
01:04:20,068 --> 01:04:23,030
- <i>What car?</i>
- <i>A black Simca 1000.</i>

606
01:04:23,155 --> 01:04:24,531
<i>Bye, Mario. See you tomorrow. </i>

607
01:05:41,024 --> 01:05:42,526
Roger, he's leaving.

608
01:05:45,696 --> 01:05:47,197
Let him go.

609
01:05:47,906 --> 01:05:49,449
We'll get him at the Calanques.

610
01:05:49,533 --> 01:05:51,118
If he sees he's followed, it's over.

611
01:05:53,245 --> 01:05:54,788
I'll never get it.

612
01:05:55,330 --> 01:05:56,707
Bust our ass to catch guys,

613
01:05:56,790 --> 01:05:59,376
and once we get them,
we let them go.

614
01:06:10,721 --> 01:06:12,431
I waited over an hour.

615
01:06:14,016 --> 01:06:16,268
It's odd he didn't show up.

616
01:06:17,853 --> 01:06:20,689
He changes his mind sometimes.

617
01:06:21,773 --> 01:06:24,776
Put yourself in his shoes.
On the run, you get wary.

618
01:06:26,028 --> 01:06:29,615
We should visit the factory
in St. Denis.

619
01:06:32,034 --> 01:06:34,995
There's no time to loose.
Payday is Tuesday.

620
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:36,830
Yes, it's urgent.

621
01:06:47,883 --> 01:06:48,717
Gentlemen.

622
01:07:10,989 --> 01:07:11,990
Hello.

623
01:07:13,158 --> 01:07:16,954
Jeannot, the friend I told you about
for the next job.

624
01:07:27,214 --> 01:07:28,882
I don't get it, Emile.

625
01:07:29,007 --> 01:07:30,884
About the meeting?

626
01:07:32,261 --> 01:07:33,929
I'll explain later.

627
01:07:34,888 --> 01:07:36,682
- Miss.
- Coming.

628
01:07:38,141 --> 01:07:39,977
My treat.

629
01:07:41,270 --> 01:07:43,355
Looks like the food's good here.

630
01:07:43,438 --> 01:07:44,982
Very good.

631
01:07:45,899 --> 01:07:48,068
I didn't expect to see you here.

632
01:07:48,193 --> 01:07:49,695
You know...

633
01:07:51,655 --> 01:07:53,615
no one ever expects to see me.

634
01:07:53,699 --> 01:07:56,159
Sometimes I just show up.

635
01:08:05,419 --> 01:08:08,130
What does that mean, Emile?

636
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:12,426
Nothing.

637
01:08:13,302 --> 01:08:15,095
I'm having a laugh.

638
01:08:15,888 --> 01:08:17,931
I like to have a laugh
now and then.

639
01:08:19,266 --> 01:08:22,603
Paulo said you ate here often,
so we stopped by just in case.

640
01:08:24,062 --> 01:08:25,939
I'll take a pâté to start.

641
01:08:28,483 --> 01:08:29,484
Me too.

642
01:08:41,747 --> 01:08:45,000
Good night, gentlemen.

643
01:08:48,837 --> 01:08:52,716
Come to my place for a drink?

644
01:08:53,550 --> 01:08:54,718
Where's that?

645
01:08:54,843 --> 01:08:58,055
Ville d'Avray. I've got a little place
on the road to Versailles.

646
01:08:58,639 --> 01:09:02,142
I've got a date with a girl
when she gets off work.

647
01:09:02,267 --> 01:09:03,769
She can wait.

648
01:09:03,894 --> 01:09:06,104
It's good for chicks.

649
01:09:08,857 --> 01:09:10,859
You can't refuse a drink.

650
01:09:39,263 --> 01:09:41,265
Must be the ignition.

651
01:09:45,894 --> 01:09:48,272
I'll take a leak.

652
01:09:49,022 --> 01:09:50,983
Not a bad idea.

653
01:10:12,963 --> 01:10:14,631
Now, Wop!

654
01:10:16,425 --> 01:10:18,468
What are you doing, Emile?

655
01:10:19,386 --> 01:10:22,306
Born in the Year of the Rat,
weren't you?

656
01:10:24,433 --> 01:10:25,976
You crazy?

657
01:10:26,685 --> 01:10:28,395
You asshole.

658
01:10:30,147 --> 01:10:32,399
You keep out of this.

659
01:10:40,782 --> 01:10:41,992
Paulo.

660
01:10:44,786 --> 01:10:46,121
The Wop was an informer.

661
01:10:48,957 --> 01:10:51,043
I didn't have time to warn you.

662
01:10:52,294 --> 01:10:55,380
The cops were waiting
at the meeting spot today.

663
01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:02,971
He won't be chatting
with them anymore.

664
01:11:51,979 --> 01:11:54,523
Let's clear out.
Quick.

665
01:12:12,541 --> 01:12:13,917
Hurry up!

666
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:18,589
Quick!

667
01:12:35,439 --> 01:12:36,982
The bastard.

668
01:12:38,775 --> 01:12:43,780
"Worker, Former Resistance Member,
Victim of Killer Buisson.

669
01:12:44,448 --> 01:12:48,202
Our friend Guégan
gave his life for Capital.

670
01:12:48,327 --> 01:12:52,289
While Mr. Jules Moch's police
are beating up miners in the north,

671
01:12:52,414 --> 01:12:57,002
Emile Buisson is still on the loose,
shamelessly killing innocent workers.

672
01:12:57,085 --> 01:13:00,339
What are the geniuses
at the Federal Police up to?

673
01:13:01,423 --> 01:13:03,926
Where are these cops,

674
01:13:04,051 --> 01:13:07,679
called 'supermen' by certain
members of the press corps. "

675
01:13:07,804 --> 01:13:09,681
That's for Borniche.

676
01:13:10,432 --> 01:13:14,937
They attack Moch, he'll attack us.

677
01:13:15,062 --> 01:13:17,606
Not to mention the unions.

678
01:13:17,731 --> 01:13:19,816
Right now, it's a big joke.

679
01:13:20,359 --> 01:13:22,778
- Where's Borniche?
- It's his day off.

680
01:13:22,861 --> 01:13:25,113
I'll give him a goddamn day off!

681
01:13:25,239 --> 01:13:28,575
Along with the whole bunch of you!

682
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:30,577
The Buisson case is closed!

683
01:13:31,203 --> 01:13:32,913
I'm taking you off it.

684
01:13:36,166 --> 01:13:38,377
Get me Borniche at home.

685
01:13:39,127 --> 01:13:40,671
Yeah, hurry up.

686
01:13:47,719 --> 01:13:49,680
Good morning.

687
01:13:49,805 --> 01:13:51,682
Yes, he's here.
I'll get him.

688
01:14:03,068 --> 01:14:04,653
It's for you.

689
01:14:04,778 --> 01:14:06,989
- Who is it?
- The boss.

690
01:14:12,494 --> 01:14:14,329
Morning, Chief.

691
01:14:16,290 --> 01:14:17,791
I can't answer so fast.

692
01:14:17,916 --> 01:14:19,960
You know I've done everything I could.

693
01:14:26,925 --> 01:14:28,010
Okay.

694
01:14:30,345 --> 01:14:32,222
As you like.

695
01:14:33,098 --> 01:14:37,060
I'm more likely to get him
than Degreffe.

696
01:14:41,481 --> 01:14:43,525
See you tomorrow, sir.

697
01:15:26,860 --> 01:15:28,403
What was that about?

698
01:15:29,821 --> 01:15:32,241
I'm off the Buisson case.

699
01:15:32,366 --> 01:15:34,952
He woke you to say that?
He's insane.

700
01:15:36,161 --> 01:15:37,996
He's a civil servant.

701
01:15:38,121 --> 01:15:39,623
He's afraid of his superiors.

702
01:15:40,207 --> 01:15:42,501
You can't let yourself
be abused like that.

703
01:15:53,470 --> 01:15:55,138
Some days.

704
01:15:57,808 --> 01:15:59,852
Some days what?

705
01:16:01,645 --> 01:16:04,356
I'd like to be Emile Buisson.

706
01:16:08,527 --> 01:16:10,195
For God's sake!

707
01:16:12,447 --> 01:16:14,199
10,000 bread tickets,

708
01:16:14,283 --> 01:16:17,035
as many gasoline tickets,
and you deny it?

709
01:16:17,953 --> 01:16:21,290
What, the devil goes to work
in your print shop at night?

710
01:16:22,082 --> 01:16:25,002
You should check my employees.

711
01:16:41,226 --> 01:16:43,020
Nice work.

712
01:16:44,104 --> 01:16:45,814
Come on.

713
01:16:46,732 --> 01:16:48,233
Be reasonable.

714
01:16:48,358 --> 01:16:51,445
If not,
we might get mad.

715
01:16:51,987 --> 01:16:53,864
Come with me.

716
01:16:53,989 --> 01:16:56,575
A corpse near Versailles.

717
01:16:56,658 --> 01:16:58,660
The chief chose us.

718
01:17:00,329 --> 01:17:01,872
How kind.

719
01:17:03,123 --> 01:17:04,791
I'll leave you with him.

720
01:17:11,089 --> 01:17:13,842
I advise you not to waste our time.

721
01:18:19,366 --> 01:18:23,161
Didn't find much.
A settling of scores.

722
01:18:23,912 --> 01:18:24,955
Let's see the face.

723
01:18:32,963 --> 01:18:34,506
Come look.

724
01:18:35,424 --> 01:18:37,176
Looks like the Wop.

725
01:18:38,177 --> 01:18:39,386
Mario?

726
01:18:42,514 --> 01:18:44,683
I'm sure of it.

727
01:18:44,808 --> 01:18:46,768
I'll be damned.

728
01:18:48,770 --> 01:18:50,314
How's that for luck?

729
01:18:50,397 --> 01:18:51,940
You know him?

730
01:18:53,025 --> 01:18:55,235
Probably know who killed him too.

731
01:19:03,911 --> 01:19:05,579
That's great!

732
01:19:05,704 --> 01:19:07,581
Now you interfere in our work!

733
01:19:07,706 --> 01:19:09,208
Turn it down a notch.

734
01:19:09,333 --> 01:19:12,711
What do you want?
Got a warrant?

735
01:19:12,794 --> 01:19:14,505
Warrant or not,
you're coming with us.

736
01:19:14,630 --> 01:19:17,341
I am not!
I wasn't soliciting!

737
01:19:17,466 --> 01:19:19,301
That guy your fiancé?

738
01:19:19,885 --> 01:19:22,930
We're just looking for
Mario's murderer. That's all.

739
01:19:24,181 --> 01:19:26,058
I don't give a damn about him!

740
01:19:26,183 --> 01:19:29,353
I got nothing to do with him.
If he croaked, that's too bad.

741
01:19:29,478 --> 01:19:31,813
I left him more than a year ago.

742
01:19:31,939 --> 01:19:34,775
Want me to give him
a first class funeral?

743
01:19:35,442 --> 01:19:36,902
Maybe you know his friends.

744
01:19:37,027 --> 01:19:39,363
I know nothing!
And I've got nothing to say!

745
01:19:39,905 --> 01:19:42,157
All I got to give is my ass!

746
01:19:42,282 --> 01:19:44,576
That good enough for you?

747
01:19:44,660 --> 01:19:47,913
Whatever you say, Jenny.
We might take you up on that.

748
01:19:48,038 --> 01:19:51,333
That's it!
The pigs will send me a ham.

749
01:19:51,458 --> 01:19:53,001
For Christmas.

750
01:20:01,051 --> 01:20:02,636
What you laughing at, jerk?

751
01:20:05,347 --> 01:20:06,682
Come to think of it,

752
01:20:07,599 --> 01:20:09,935
you knew him too,

753
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:12,229
Mario the Wop?

754
01:20:12,354 --> 01:20:14,606
No, not well.

755
01:20:15,148 --> 01:20:16,859
His friends?

756
01:20:16,984 --> 01:20:18,735
I never saw his friends.

757
01:20:20,487 --> 01:20:22,698
You never saw anyone in the bar?

758
01:20:22,823 --> 01:20:24,783
No, I swear, Inspector.

759
01:20:31,373 --> 01:20:33,292
Just warming up.

760
01:20:33,375 --> 01:20:35,794
- My glasses.
- Don't need to see.

761
01:20:36,336 --> 01:20:38,046
Just need to talk.

762
01:20:39,298 --> 01:20:40,841
You skunk.

763
01:20:41,633 --> 01:20:42,634
Well?

764
01:20:44,595 --> 01:20:46,889
Who did Mario see?

765
01:20:48,015 --> 01:20:51,226
If you got nothing to say,
we'll get you for running a whorehouse.

766
01:20:51,351 --> 01:20:53,312
Your deal with the Vice Squad
won't help!

767
01:20:53,437 --> 01:20:55,522
I don't know.

768
01:20:56,231 --> 01:20:57,691
Sometimes he came with Paulo.

769
01:20:57,816 --> 01:20:59,151
Paulo?

770
01:20:59,276 --> 01:21:00,485
Paulo what?

771
01:21:00,611 --> 01:21:04,198
The bomber, his wife is sick.

772
01:21:05,449 --> 01:21:06,033
Syphilis?

773
01:21:06,158 --> 01:21:10,662
No, TB. She's in a home.

774
01:21:12,122 --> 01:21:13,999
Where does he live?

775
01:21:14,082 --> 01:21:16,043
I don't know.

776
01:21:17,628 --> 01:21:19,463
It's probably in our files.

777
01:21:23,675 --> 01:21:25,177
Come on.

778
01:21:32,434 --> 01:21:34,144
Alias Paulo the Bomber.

779
01:21:34,228 --> 01:21:37,898
Listed in the special file,
"The Fight Against Gangsters. "

780
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:42,945
Paul Roubier, alias Paulo the Bomber.
Born March 29, 1904.

781
01:21:46,448 --> 01:21:48,408
This might be a good lead.

782
01:21:50,953 --> 01:21:52,913
- Well?
- Look.

783
01:21:53,038 --> 01:21:55,582
With Buisson in '42
at the Victories Street holdup.

784
01:21:55,707 --> 01:21:58,085
They got off for lack of proof.

785
01:21:58,210 --> 01:21:59,920
Victories or Victory Street?

786
01:22:00,003 --> 01:22:01,547
Victories.

787
01:22:02,089 --> 01:22:03,966
I'll send out a wanted notice.

788
01:22:05,217 --> 01:22:07,261
No, just find his wife.

789
01:22:08,345 --> 01:22:09,596
What?

790
01:22:27,781 --> 01:22:29,783
Don't be sad.

791
01:22:31,201 --> 01:22:33,078
See you next week.

792
01:23:10,824 --> 01:23:13,535
- Give me a ride to Paris, Roubier?
- What do you want?

793
01:23:13,619 --> 01:23:15,871
We're not in the same club,
but we can still have a chat.

794
01:23:17,456 --> 01:23:22,169
The Pacra factory is offering a million
to anyone helping to arrest the killer.

795
01:23:23,337 --> 01:23:25,255
The killer is Emile Buisson.

796
01:23:28,050 --> 01:23:30,385
You've worked for less.

797
01:23:31,261 --> 01:23:33,555
Get that crooked head thinking.

798
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:39,853
What you're doing is disgusting.

799
01:23:42,689 --> 01:23:45,275
If you refuse,
it'll get even more disgusting.

800
01:23:46,527 --> 01:23:49,613
You need streptomycin
to save your wife.

801
01:23:50,447 --> 01:23:53,450
I promise I'll get it from the States.

802
01:23:56,411 --> 01:23:59,998
You gonna hesitate between
a killer like Buisson and your wife?

803
01:24:05,254 --> 01:24:06,964
Another thing.

804
01:24:08,799 --> 01:24:11,385
I know you were a friend of
Mario the Wop.

805
01:24:13,011 --> 01:24:16,098
Emile killed him for nothing.

806
01:24:19,268 --> 01:24:21,478
The Wop wasn't an informer.

807
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:24,231
Mr. Emile got that one wrong.

808
01:24:24,773 --> 01:24:27,359
We'll spread the word around.

809
01:24:36,785 --> 01:24:39,329
But in case you don't cooperate,

810
01:24:39,413 --> 01:24:41,874
I'm sure you were
in the latest holdups.

811
01:24:43,625 --> 01:24:45,169
And I'll prove it.

812
01:24:46,170 --> 01:24:49,298
I'll send you up
for 15 to 20 years.

813
01:24:50,007 --> 01:24:52,426
You'll never see your wife again.

814
01:25:04,855 --> 01:25:06,398
I hate myself.

815
01:25:14,948 --> 01:25:16,491
Me too.

816
01:25:17,409 --> 01:25:19,369
But we have no choice,

817
01:25:20,537 --> 01:25:23,081
either one of us.

818
01:25:46,730 --> 01:25:48,232
Hi.

819
01:25:51,860 --> 01:25:55,113
A tip, the Versailles tax office.

820
01:25:55,239 --> 01:25:56,949
There's a pile.

821
01:25:57,491 --> 01:25:59,743
- How much?
- 12 to 15 grand.

822
01:26:01,328 --> 01:26:02,496
The hideout?

823
01:26:02,621 --> 01:26:05,541
I found something
in the countryside, a hotel.

824
01:26:05,666 --> 01:26:07,167
I know the owner.

825
01:26:09,670 --> 01:26:11,672
Gotta find me a piece.

826
01:26:12,381 --> 01:26:14,466
Mine's hot.
It's gotta go down the drain.

827
01:26:14,550 --> 01:26:16,552
I'll find you one.

828
01:26:16,635 --> 01:26:18,345
A P.38, if possible.

829
01:26:20,305 --> 01:26:22,599
I always liked them.

830
01:26:27,771 --> 01:26:30,023
What? A gun for Buisson?

831
01:26:31,024 --> 01:26:32,276
Are you mad, Borniche?

832
01:26:34,611 --> 01:26:37,447
Do you realize what you're asking for?

833
01:26:37,573 --> 01:26:39,241
A P.38,

834
01:26:39,366 --> 01:26:41,076
if possible.

835
01:26:42,786 --> 01:26:44,288
A P.38?

836
01:26:46,206 --> 01:26:48,000
He prefers them.

837
01:26:52,921 --> 01:26:56,550
What if we give him a Colt?
Will he throw a tantrum?

838
01:26:59,803 --> 01:27:03,015
You know what his temper is like.

839
01:27:03,140 --> 01:27:04,808
Listen, Borniche.

840
01:27:04,933 --> 01:27:07,561
This time you've crossed the line!

841
01:27:07,686 --> 01:27:11,273
You put yourself back
in charge of the Buisson case.

842
01:27:11,398 --> 01:27:14,109
You invented a ridiculous story!

843
01:27:14,234 --> 01:27:16,528
Excuse me, Chief.

844
01:27:16,612 --> 01:27:19,198
You told me to investigate
a corpse in the Ville d'Avray.

845
01:27:19,740 --> 01:27:21,950
Am I to blame
if it brought me back to Buisson?

846
01:27:22,034 --> 01:27:25,954
- You kept it to yourself.
- I wanted to be sure.

847
01:27:26,038 --> 01:27:27,956
That suited you.

848
01:27:28,081 --> 01:27:29,082
So,

849
01:27:29,166 --> 01:27:34,713
now we give Mr. Buisson
a vacation in a country hotel.

850
01:27:34,838 --> 01:27:39,635
And on top of that, you want
to give him a gun to shoot us with?

851
01:27:40,511 --> 01:27:41,762
Really.

852
01:27:42,513 --> 01:27:47,684
It's become a huge joke.

853
01:27:48,894 --> 01:27:50,687
I'll get Buisson a P.38.

854
01:27:50,771 --> 01:27:53,857
Where, Inspector?

855
01:27:53,941 --> 01:27:56,193
A souvenir of French commandos.

856
01:27:57,152 --> 01:28:00,239
If anything happens,
I'll have you locked up.

857
01:28:00,989 --> 01:28:02,699
Do you hear me?

858
01:28:03,408 --> 01:28:05,369
Very well, sir.

859
01:28:05,452 --> 01:28:07,329
My regards.

860
01:28:37,776 --> 01:28:38,902
Here.

861
01:29:44,927 --> 01:29:46,637
It wasn't easy.

862
01:29:55,020 --> 01:29:57,022
Just kidding.

863
01:30:00,442 --> 01:30:01,610
Your tax man?

864
01:30:04,404 --> 01:30:06,281
Jeannot is working on it.

865
01:30:08,617 --> 01:30:12,329
Tell him to hurry it up.
I'm bored to hell here.

866
01:30:12,412 --> 01:30:14,289
It's time I left France.

867
01:30:16,124 --> 01:30:17,125
Bring a paper?

868
01:30:28,971 --> 01:30:30,472
Damn.

869
01:30:31,056 --> 01:30:32,766
If the government
would get off my back,

870
01:30:32,891 --> 01:30:35,853
I'd give the jerks more
than a strike to worry about.

871
01:31:07,342 --> 01:31:09,386
- Is the chief out?
- Still in Lyon.

872
01:31:10,304 --> 01:31:12,639
He'll be back at noon.

873
01:31:12,764 --> 01:31:14,725
We'll have to go on without him.

874
01:31:14,850 --> 01:31:17,394
Impossible, he'll be mad.

875
01:31:17,477 --> 01:31:19,271
So he'll be mad.

876
01:31:19,354 --> 01:31:21,773
- It's now or never.
- Just a minute.

877
01:31:21,857 --> 01:31:24,610
- Did you warn the local precinct?
- No. If Buisson suspects anything,

878
01:31:24,735 --> 01:31:27,029
we won't get him alive.

879
01:31:27,112 --> 01:31:30,282
Moreover, Roubier says
he always carries a grenade

880
01:31:30,407 --> 01:31:32,284
to blow himself up if necessary.

881
01:31:32,367 --> 01:31:35,454
You're insane. We're taking a huge risk,
and we're not even covered.

882
01:31:35,537 --> 01:31:39,458
It's a rule to warn the precinct
and the chief.

883
01:31:39,583 --> 01:31:42,169
Aren't we in the service?

884
01:31:43,212 --> 01:31:45,464
I'm not forcing you to come.

885
01:31:58,393 --> 01:32:00,312
- Alfonse.
- Inspector?

886
01:32:01,063 --> 01:32:03,273
- Put that on the chief's desk.
- Right away.

887
01:32:05,901 --> 01:32:09,321
- Asked for a car?
- A special one is waiting.

888
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:56,743
You all right?

889
01:33:16,805 --> 01:33:18,473
Fill her up, please.

890
01:33:19,558 --> 01:33:21,768
Roger, the other side.

891
01:34:16,448 --> 01:34:19,785
- Can we eat here?
- Yes, sir. We have a restaurant.

892
01:34:19,910 --> 01:34:21,245
Great!

893
01:34:22,871 --> 01:34:24,373
We'll lunch here.

894
01:34:24,498 --> 01:34:26,834
We can be at the clinic at 4:00.

895
01:34:31,588 --> 01:34:33,841
- May I park here?
- Of course, sir.

896
01:35:33,567 --> 01:35:37,154
"Lunching with Buisson at the hotel.

897
01:35:37,988 --> 01:35:42,659
Come for coffee.
Respectfully, Borniche. "

898
01:35:43,410 --> 01:35:44,912
Good God!

899
01:36:12,356 --> 01:36:13,857
What's he doing?

900
01:36:14,608 --> 01:36:16,151
Looking at the car.

901
01:36:16,235 --> 01:36:19,154
He can take it.
I have a plug.

902
01:36:22,533 --> 01:36:23,784
You all right?

903
01:36:23,909 --> 01:36:26,119
Going crazy, but I'm fine.

904
01:36:31,708 --> 01:36:33,961
The table is ready.

905
01:36:36,713 --> 01:36:38,966
- Take your pick.
- Over there.

906
01:36:41,343 --> 01:36:42,886
Here are the menus.

907
01:36:43,470 --> 01:36:45,514
I recommend the chicken, a specialty.

908
01:36:45,597 --> 01:36:48,183
The chicken will be great.
Bring hors d'oeuvres first.

909
01:36:48,267 --> 01:36:51,311
- For me too.
- No, thanks.

910
01:36:51,436 --> 01:36:54,481
I'll bring the hors d'oeuvres
and a bottle of the local wine.

911
01:36:54,565 --> 01:36:56,108
Yeah, thanks.

912
01:37:14,543 --> 01:37:17,296
"Music soothes the savage beast. "

913
01:38:15,729 --> 01:38:16,772
You play well.

914
01:38:19,191 --> 01:38:21,860
Little things, not Chopin.

915
01:38:23,111 --> 01:38:24,947
I like things like that better.

916
01:38:27,449 --> 01:38:29,034
Know any other Edith Piaf?

917
01:38:59,022 --> 01:39:00,566
Here you are.

918
01:39:02,150 --> 01:39:04,027
Have you decided, sir?

919
01:39:04,778 --> 01:39:06,321
Chicken.

920
01:39:07,906 --> 01:39:10,492
Come and eat, Catherine.
We're late.

921
01:39:14,955 --> 01:39:16,498
Thank you, miss.

922
01:39:22,462 --> 01:39:24,006
Excuse us, sir.

923
01:39:36,185 --> 01:39:38,604
You're not giving him a concert.

924
01:39:40,355 --> 01:39:42,232
He's got nice eyes.

925
01:39:45,402 --> 01:39:48,739
He's about to move in, Roger.

926
01:39:48,864 --> 01:39:50,532
Go ahead, laugh.

927
01:39:50,657 --> 01:39:52,534
May I eat, ma'am?

928
01:39:56,705 --> 01:39:59,458
- He's coming back.
- Eat and don't turn around.

929
01:40:08,133 --> 01:40:11,220
I think <i>Le Caporal Epinglé</i>
should have won the Goncourt.

930
01:40:11,970 --> 01:40:13,472
Read it?

931
01:40:16,141 --> 01:40:17,935
Not much time to read

932
01:40:18,060 --> 01:40:20,771
with all these strikes.

933
01:40:20,854 --> 01:40:24,107
Literary awards
are fixed by publishers.

934
01:40:24,233 --> 01:40:25,692
How about some wine?

935
01:40:32,991 --> 01:40:35,035
Excuse me, I forgot.

936
01:40:46,171 --> 01:40:47,714
Excuse me.

937
01:40:54,596 --> 01:40:56,640
Better call the clinic.

938
01:40:58,100 --> 01:40:59,601
Yes, perhaps.

939
01:41:00,853 --> 01:41:05,941
- Can we call Rambouillet?
- Of course. What number?

940
01:41:06,066 --> 01:41:09,027
- 432.
- 432 Rambouillet.

941
01:41:29,464 --> 01:41:32,467
Hello, miss.
Mother Goose Inn here.

942
01:41:32,551 --> 01:41:35,470
Rambouillet 432, please.

943
01:41:42,519 --> 01:41:44,563
Hope you enjoy it.

944
01:41:49,693 --> 01:41:50,736
Really?

945
01:41:51,695 --> 01:41:53,113
Hold on a minute.

946
01:41:53,197 --> 01:41:55,365
That number doesn't exist.

947
01:41:59,828 --> 01:42:01,079
What?

948
01:42:04,958 --> 01:42:07,211
It's the Ambroise Paré Clinic.

949
01:42:07,336 --> 01:42:08,670
Wait.

950
01:42:08,795 --> 01:42:11,131
Is this the Ambroise Paré Clinic?

951
01:42:11,215 --> 01:42:14,051
- She make a mistake?
- Ambroise Paré?

952
01:42:14,801 --> 01:42:16,512
Mrs. Mercier?

953
01:42:17,888 --> 01:42:19,431
Dr. Le Garrec here.

954
01:42:22,809 --> 01:42:24,895
We're a little late.

955
01:42:26,522 --> 01:42:29,107
Tell the boss I'll be there at 4:00.

956
01:42:31,068 --> 01:42:32,945
We're on our way.

957
01:42:34,112 --> 01:42:35,197
Yes.

958
01:42:36,281 --> 01:42:37,950
Fine, Mrs. Mercier.

959
01:42:38,534 --> 01:42:40,077
See you later.

960
01:42:47,668 --> 01:42:50,254
- How's the chicken coming?
- It's coming up.

961
01:42:50,379 --> 01:42:52,589
Taste it.
It's her specialty.

962
01:42:52,714 --> 01:42:55,425
- Some bread, please.
- Oh, yeah. Coming.

963
01:42:59,847 --> 01:43:01,849
Excuse me, my wife forgot.

964
01:43:01,932 --> 01:43:03,809
- Everything all right?
- Great.

965
01:43:15,445 --> 01:43:17,155
It's over, Emile!

966
01:43:19,199 --> 01:43:20,576
The grenade! Good God!

967
01:44:14,254 --> 01:44:17,174
<i>What followed is routine police work. </i>

968
01:44:17,883 --> 01:44:19,885
<i>Buisson imprisoned in the Santé. </i>

969
01:44:19,968 --> 01:44:24,097
<i>I questioned him before</i>
<i>a special commission. </i>

970
01:44:24,681 --> 01:44:28,477
<i>Twice a week,</i>
<i>I picked him up in a station car,</i>

971
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:30,938
<i>early in the morning. </i>

972
01:44:33,023 --> 01:44:35,442
- Morning, Mr. Borniche.
- Hi, Emile.

973
01:44:36,527 --> 01:44:38,987
<i>Little by little,</i>
<i>certainly not on purpose,</i>

974
01:44:39,071 --> 01:44:42,282
<i>something strange</i>
<i>happened between us. </i>

975
01:44:42,824 --> 01:44:47,162
<i>Friendship would be a big word,</i>
<i>but we became pals. </i>

976
01:44:47,871 --> 01:44:49,748
<i>We nearly understood one another,</i>

977
01:44:49,873 --> 01:44:52,626
<i>especially when talking</i>
<i>about the weather. </i>

978
01:45:45,512 --> 01:45:48,098
- Come back for him at 6:00.
- Very well.

979
01:46:14,458 --> 01:46:16,835
<i>So Emile would sit down. </i>

980
01:46:17,711 --> 01:46:20,589
<i>With his free hand,</i>
<i>he'd pour himself a glass of Bordeaux. </i>

981
01:46:21,340 --> 01:46:23,717
<i>I bought him a bottle of it. </i>

982
01:46:31,934 --> 01:46:37,481
<i>He'd take out his thick glasses</i>
<i>and read the</i> Figaro <i>on the table. </i>

983
01:46:52,162 --> 01:46:53,539
<i>It was 11:00.</i>

984
01:46:53,664 --> 01:46:56,041
<i>I wouldn't question him till 12:30.</i>

985
01:46:58,502 --> 01:47:01,588
<i>I'd go over the reports. </i>
<i>A moment of peace. </i>

986
01:47:02,297 --> 01:47:04,883
<i>Emile, just the news. </i>

987
01:47:12,599 --> 01:47:15,686
Why do you always
read the <i>Figaro?</i>

988
01:47:15,769 --> 01:47:17,521
Habit.

989
01:47:18,105 --> 01:47:21,650
On the run, no one suspects a guy
reading the <i>Figaro. </i> It's too serious.

990
01:47:21,775 --> 01:47:24,820
<i>At 2:00, serious work begins. </i>

991
01:47:25,237 --> 01:47:29,616
<i>The stack of files on Mr. Emile</i>
<i>were almost five feet high. </i>

992
01:47:30,325 --> 01:47:32,995
<i>He was charged with</i>
<i>36 murders and holdups. </i>

993
01:47:33,120 --> 01:47:34,663
<i>They threw the book at him. </i>

994
01:47:34,746 --> 01:47:38,542
<i>But I had to go through all of it</i>
<i>to separate truth from falsehood. </i>

995
01:47:39,293 --> 01:47:42,296
<i>Emile confessed to everything</i>
<i>except for the killings. </i>

996
01:47:42,421 --> 01:47:45,090
<i>But I had condemning evidence,</i>

997
01:47:45,174 --> 01:47:46,884
<i>unshakable witnesses,</i>

998
01:47:47,009 --> 01:47:51,180
<i>and the P.38 business</i>
<i>weighed heavily against him. </i>

999
01:47:59,479 --> 01:48:00,689
Shall we start?

1000
01:48:02,316 --> 01:48:04,193
Let's start, Mr. Borniche.

1001
01:48:09,072 --> 01:48:11,283
<i>Our meetings went on for over a year. </i>

1002
01:48:12,367 --> 01:48:15,621
<i>Only once did the real Buisson show. </i>

1003
01:48:16,538 --> 01:48:20,667
<i>The day we talked about Paul Roubier,</i>
<i>Paulo the Bomber. </i>

1004
01:48:29,426 --> 01:48:31,470
That guy, Mr. Borniche,

1005
01:48:33,555 --> 01:48:36,308
I'd like to take a handsaw
to his throat...

1006
01:48:39,811 --> 01:48:42,397
and stop from time to time
to hear him scream.

1007
01:48:53,158 --> 01:48:55,035
I'm afraid you won't get the chance.

1008
01:48:56,537 --> 01:48:57,538
Yeah.

1009
01:49:08,131 --> 01:49:09,883
Too bad.

1010
01:49:17,391 --> 01:49:22,020
<i>I sat in silence watching Buisson,</i>

1011
01:49:22,104 --> 01:49:23,689
<i>motionless in his chair,</i>

1012
01:49:23,772 --> 01:49:25,983
<i>his right arm hanging in the cuffs. </i>

1013
01:49:28,443 --> 01:49:33,115
<i>I thought to myself,</i>
<i>"Emile has guts. "</i>

1014
01:49:56,597 --> 01:49:59,266
Condemned to death
by the Seine High Court,

1015
01:49:59,391 --> 01:50:02,978
Emile Buisson was executed
on February 28, 1956.

1016
01:50:13,405 --> 01:50:16,325
