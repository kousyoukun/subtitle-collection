1
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:01,596
Come, spirit.

2
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:06,930
Help us sing the story of our land,

3
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:13,354
You are our mother.

4
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:19,743
We, your field of corn.

5
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,037
We rise

6
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:28,995
from out of the soul of you,

7
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,751
Dear Mother.

8
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:25,966
You till the land with your beauty,

9
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:42,692
How shall I seek you?

10
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,203
Show me your face,

11
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,413
You, a great river...

12
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:00,209
that never runs dry,

13
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,310
Let him go.

14
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:52,396
You said to hang him, sir.

15
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:57,993
Now, remember, Smith,
you‘ve come to these shores in chains.

16
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,904
You’re under a cloud

17
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:05,493
which will darken considerably if I hear
any more of your mutinous remarks.

18
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:06,747
Is that understood?

19
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:04,092
Captain Newport, sir.

20
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:06,098
I found oysters.

21
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:09,056
They’re as thick as my hands.
They’re the size of stones, sir.

22
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,766
And there’s fish everywhere.
They‘re flappin‘ against your legs.

23
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,603
- We’re gonna live like kings.
- All these months at sea.

24
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:18,235
I‘m weary of looking further.

25
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,112
This place will serve.

26
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:24,367
We have deep water to the shore.
We can see up and down the river.

27
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,449
Our enemies will have
no advantage of surprise.

28
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:30,786
Uh, bring the anchors
and mainsails to shore,

29
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,965
in case some homesick persons
decide to slip away with them.

30
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,798
We must be careful
not to offend the Naturals.

31
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,881
If our crops hail,
we shall be obliged to trade with them.

32
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:46,184
Once we he established here,

33
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:48,637
we may go up the over

34
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:52,144
and seek a route to the other sea.

35
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,072
The savages often visit us kindly.

36
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,706
Timid, like a herd of curious deer,

37
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:38,205
Tonight we shall sleep
aboard our ships, everyone in full armor.

38
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:41,086
In the morning,
we will chop down every tree

39
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,917
within half a mile of the moorage

40
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,970
and use the straightest limbs
to erect a line at watchtowers

41
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,843
and to build our fort.

42
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,799
When we have done that,

43
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:54,433
we set our wheat and barley,
put up houses and lay In firewood

44
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:58,062
Slackers will be whipped
at the sight of their transgression.

45
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,517
- Sir.
- Yes, Emery?

46
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,944
When might we, uh, be going out to...

47
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,898
poke about, sir?

48
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:08,444
We are not here to pillage and raid.

49
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:12,122
We are here to establish a colony.

50
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,207
How many lands behind me?

51
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,206
Gold will do you no good.

52
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,629
Not six months from now
when the shows begin to fly.

53
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,547
How many seas?

54
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,509
What blows and dangers .7

55
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,472
Fortune ever my friend

56
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:03,669
Smoke.

57
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:00,915
Five kegs is gone since we landed.
Somebody stole ’em.

58
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:04,119
Rain’s got into this, and worms here.

59
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,625
- Brand him.
- And here.

60
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,998
Cut off his ears.

61
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,885
Captured these two, sir,

62
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:17,090
talking to the men, spying.

63
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:25,348
Hey, you.

64
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,779
He stole a hatchet!

65
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,913
We have lost the favor of the Naturals.

66
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:47,370
Had we not sighted land the day we did,

67
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:49,205
I would have turned back.

68
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:53,001
We have eaten the majority of our stores.

69
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:57,179
Our best men are sick with fever.
The rest will soon breed mutiny.

70
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,257
We might as well be shipwrecked.

71
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:05,347
Now, the Naturals tell me, uh,

72
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,978
of a city up the river

73
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:11,186
and of a mighty king who lives there.

74
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:14,564
I propose we send an envoy to this king

75
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:18,447
to see whether he can
be persuaded to trade with us.

76
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:23,623
Meanwhile, I shall, uh, return
to England for fresh supplies.

77
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,620
I won’t be back until spring.

78
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:28,953
Ratcliffe here will be in command.

79
00:17:29,011 --> 00:17:33,953
As to who will approach the savage king,

80
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:37,469
I needn’t tell you
it will be a hazardous mission.

81
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:40,390
Captain Smith is the only
professional soldier among us.

82
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,556
Smith, sir?

83
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:44,386
What are - What are -
What are his qualifications?

84
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,141
Those you lack.

85
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:49,190
I should very dearly
like to know one thing.

86
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:52,565
What is to prevent
this friend of the hangman

87
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:56,489
from making league with the Naturals
and turning upon us?

88
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:59,818
Only under the extremity of torture,
I should like to assume.

89
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,699
Or, indeed, instructing them
in the conduct of war

90
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,782
and English strategies,
if I may make so bold.

91
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:10,837
H-His right to the title of captaincy
is dubious at best.

92
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,914
The lowborn son of a farmer

93
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:16,752
cannot be expected to behave
with a gentleman’s sense of propriety.

94
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:18,802
Perhaps you‘d like to go, Wingfield.

95
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:24,096
Smith, you have an opportunity
to repair your reputation.

96
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,427
I expect you to welcome it.

97
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:59,761
Who are you whom I so faintly hear,

98
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,720
who urge me ever on?

99
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,473
You have the makings of a leader, Smith.

100
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,931
Can one rely on you?

101
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:31,409
What voice is this that speaks within me,

102
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:37,165
guides me towards the best?

103
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,766
Where?

104
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,709
Always the star was guiding me.

105
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:25,804
Leading.

106
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:29,638
Drawing me on...

107
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:41,528
past the cape never rounded,

108
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:44,069
to the fabled land.

109
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,908
There, life shall begin.

110
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:49,555
A world equal to our hopes.

111
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,563
A land where one
might wash one’s soul pure,

112
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:03,565
rise to one’s true stature.

113
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,490
We shall make a new start.

114
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,076
A fresh beginning.

115
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:29,258
Here the blessings of the earth
are bestowed upon all

116
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,175
None need grow poor.

117
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:41,315
Here there is good ground for all

118
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:44,610
and no cost but one's labor.

119
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:50,404
We shall build a true commonwealth.

120
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:53,236
Hard work and self-reliance our virtues.

121
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:01,035
We shall have no landlords
to wrack us with high rents

122
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,745
or extort the fruit of our labor.

123
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:13,889
No man shall stand above any other
but all live under the same law.

124
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:29,359
Captain, we haven’t the draft
to go any further.

125
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:32,316
Put in.

126
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:59,430
None shall eat up carelessly
what his friends got worthily

127
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:02,513
or steal away
that which virtue has stored up.

128
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:09,604
Men shall not make each other their spoil

129
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:16,360
Let’s go back, sir, gather a larger party.

130
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:21,578
We’re lost.

131
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,538
There the Naturals go!

132
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,461
Let him go!

133
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:36,698
Tide‘s run out, Captain.

134
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:40,695
Bottom’s draggin’ on the mud, sir.

135
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,887
The sun.

136
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:11,179
And the moon as well.

137
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:17,017
It shows you how the sun chases the night
continually around the world.

138
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:18,563
The sky? No.

139
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:22,772
From England, a land to the east.

140
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:39,334
Leave?

141
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:45,165
There won’t be any leaving till spring.
The boats won’t be back till then.

142
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:54,600
We have articles that might interest you.

143
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:00,097
Gunpowder.

144
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:47,186
At the moment I was to die,
she threw herself upon me.

145
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:54,145
Sky.

146
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:55,725
Sky.

147
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,240
Sun.

148
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:07,616
Sun.

149
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:17,630
Water.

150
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:22,677
Wind.

151
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:24,925
Wind. Wind.

152
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:27,674
Wind.

153
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:58,663
Eyes.

154
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:01,132
Eyes.

155
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,137
Lips.

156
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:16,973
Lips.

157
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,448
Mm-hmm.

158
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:31,029
Ear.

159
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:56,350
All the children of the king
were beautiful but she, the youngest,

160
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:59,933
was so exceedingly so
that the sun himself,

161
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:01,438
though he saw her often,

162
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:04,521
was surprised whenever
she came out into his presence.

163
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:13,280
Her father had a dozen wives,

164
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:15,535
a hundred children.

165
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:17,618
But she was his favorite.

166
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:25,629
She exceeded the rest,

167
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:29,087
not only In feature and proportion,
but in wit and spirit too.

168
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,471
All loved her.

169
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,395
Moon.

170
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:37,823
Oh! Oh!

171
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:31,960
They are gentle,

172
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:33,545
loving,

173
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,255
faithful,

174
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:38,012
lacking in all guile and trickery.

175
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:44,855
The words denoting lying, deceit,

176
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:47,229
greed, envy, slander and forgiveness

177
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,026
have never been heard.

178
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:55,275
They have no jealousy,

179
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:57,531
no sense of possession.

180
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:08,709
Real, what I thought a dream.

181
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:06,782
I am not guarded

182
00:43:09,879 --> 00:43:11,369
No.

183
00:43:17,178 --> 00:43:20,090
It seems they are watching me,
yet I wander where I will.

184
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,135
- Smoke.
- Smoke.

185
00:43:28,231 --> 00:43:29,220
- Fire.
- Fire.

186
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:30,930
They trust me as a brother.

187
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:33,232
- Heat.
- Heat.

188
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:34,941
Heat.

189
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:39,022
I, who was a pirate,
who lived to steal what I could.

190
00:43:42,537 --> 00:43:44,698
I am a free man now.

191
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:51,663
All that they have is given me.

192
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:55,709
I don’t know.

193
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,125
I don’t know.

194
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:47,924
Saved a child from drowning.

195
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:53,521
Never had it struck me
so forcefully before

196
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:56,645
that I have the power
to grant life and health to others.

197
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,900
Lawless.

198
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:12,360
Heaven in all things.

199
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,121
I was a dead man.

200
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:24,538
Now I live.

201
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:37,259
You, my light.

202
00:47:41,442 --> 00:47:42,932
My America.

203
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:52,608
Love.

204
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:59,581
Shall we deny it when it visits us?

205
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:28,982
There is only this.

206
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:33,650
All else is unreal.

207
00:48:47,842 --> 00:48:49,378
Mother.

208
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:54,090
Where do you live?

209
00:48:57,893 --> 00:48:59,383
In the sky?

210
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:03,645
The clouds?

211
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:07,691
The sea?

212
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:22,114
Give me a sign.

213
00:49:31,844 --> 00:49:33,380
We rise.

214
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:38,384
We rise.

215
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:54,905
Afraid of myself

216
00:50:00,581 --> 00:50:03,618
A god, he seems to me.

217
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:17,799
What else is life but being near you?

218
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:26,136
Do they suspect?

219
00:50:30,611 --> 00:50:33,318
Oh, to be given to you.

220
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:36,488
You to me.

221
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:47,537
I will be faithful to you.

222
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:52,125
True.

223
00:51:08,816 --> 00:51:11,148
Two no more.

224
00:51:12,653 --> 00:51:14,689
One.

225
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:19,239
One.

226
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:22,943
I am.

227
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:26,830
I am.

228
00:51:52,693 --> 00:51:55,105
The king announced that I was free.

229
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:57,561
He was sending me back,

230
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,401
and on the understanding
that once spring came,

231
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:02,858
we were to go back
to where we came from.

232
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:08,747
His chiefs had advised him to kill me.

233
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:13,206
I had gained a knowledge
of their arms, their strong places.

234
00:52:15,007 --> 00:52:17,874
But his daughter assured him
I was a good man.

235
00:52:33,734 --> 00:52:36,521
I should tell people that though
the Naturals lived in peace,

236
00:52:36,612 --> 00:52:40,651
the y yet were strong and would not
suffer their land to be taken away.

237
00:52:42,326 --> 00:52:44,658
There was no sea beyond the mountains.

238
00:52:45,746 --> 00:52:48,909
Only a land stretching away forever
in great meadows,

239
00:52:50,084 --> 00:52:52,075
a land which had no end.

240
00:53:49,977 --> 00:53:51,558
Captain Smith.

241
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:55,850
You’re back.

242
00:53:58,444 --> 00:54:01,231
The savages will
have to stop here, Captain.

243
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:40,232
- Where you been?
- It‘s like seeing a ghost.

244
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:43,026
You look like you’ve come back
from the dead.

245
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:44,603
- Where’s Captain Ratcliffe?
- No word.

246
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:46,609
People said he went over to England.

247
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,736
You should’ve never trusted him.
Did you bring food?

248
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:50,067
- We’re starving.
- I brought food.

249
00:54:50,162 --> 00:54:52,619
Someone got killed.
Just fell over.

250
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:55,413
Four months of stealin‘ and stealin‘
and stealin’ and stealin’.

251
00:54:55,501 --> 00:54:56,866
Get up!

252
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:02,250
Gamblin‘. They bowl
while the houses fall down.

253
00:55:02,341 --> 00:55:05,174
- Look at the church.
- All the sickness comin’ from the marsh.

254
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,796
- Who’s takin‘ care of you?
- No one.

255
00:55:06,887 --> 00:55:09,173
That’s all it is, just dying
and sickness and all that.

256
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:11,346
- I saw a body in the mud.
- You’re a liar!

257
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:13,674
- I saw a leg in the bed.
- You are a liar!

258
00:55:13,769 --> 00:55:16,806
Why was the leg in the bed?
Why was the leg in the bed?

259
00:55:16,897 --> 00:55:19,388
Thieves! Jackals!
Lash their feet!

260
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,436
You’re looking rather well, Smith.

261
00:55:25,531 --> 00:55:27,487
Been enjoying yourself, have you?

262
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:31,112
Been enjoying yourself mightily, I expect.

263
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:37,285
You were sent to relieve our situation,
not to pleasure yourself. We here have suffered.

264
00:55:37,376 --> 00:55:39,492
I’ll ignore the stories
which bring officialdom into disrepute.

265
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:42,328
No speeches, Smith.
Things are different now.

266
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:46,252
We can’t allow cheek.

267
00:55:47,094 --> 00:55:49,836
Allow cheek, and we shall have chaos.
I wear the medal now.

268
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:52,797
I am president and you have
been stripped of your captaincy.

269
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:57,100
- Are you qualified to pass judgment on me?
- That really needn’t concern us at the moment.

270
00:55:57,896 --> 00:56:01,229
'Tis a pity you were not here at the time
of your trial to defend yourself.

271
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:04,900
I presume you were too afraid,
too guilty to return.

272
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:08,562
- My trial?
- Yes.

273
00:56:08,657 --> 00:56:11,194
You were indicted
upon a chapter in Leviticus

274
00:56:11,285 --> 00:56:13,776
and tried during
the period of your desertion.

275
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:16,035
Our law is speedy here.

276
00:56:16,123 --> 00:56:20,241
Been keepin‘ all the good food
for himself, Smith, giving us rotten corn.

277
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:24,544
You, sir, have no other eyes and ears
than those which grow on Smith’s head here.

278
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:27,122
He does nothing
but tend his own pot, spit and oven.

279
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:30,755
I have shared all.
I have kept nothing for myself. Nothing!

280
00:56:30,846 --> 00:56:33,963
His name is not even Wingfield.
It’s Woodson.

281
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:36,260
Woodson is the name.

282
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:38,929
Left England under a cloud of disgrace.

283
00:56:39,021 --> 00:56:41,262
Seize them. Seize them!

284
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:47,150
Any man impeding the punishment of
these rogues will be dealt with harshly!

285
00:56:51,617 --> 00:56:53,198
Here.

286
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:58,404
There‘s no sense in waiting for a trial.
This is mutiny.

287
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:00,830
I dispatch you herewith
in the name of the king.

288
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:11,045
Dead as an herring.
Serves him right.

289
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:13,422
I can ratify what Mr. Argall said.

290
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:15,253
Were we in England,
I should be ashamed

291
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:17,135
to let my servant keep company
with such fellows.

292
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:18,761
You never had a servant.
You were a servant.

293
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:21,264
I et a single chicken,
and that when I were ill.

294
00:57:21,355 --> 00:57:24,222
Small here has eaten six, a number of which
he could not be troubled to cook.

295
00:57:24,316 --> 00:57:25,931
I say it’s Captain Smith should lead us.

296
00:57:26,026 --> 00:57:27,516
- Aye
- Aye

297
00:58:07,526 --> 00:58:09,016
Tell her.

298
00:58:11,697 --> 00:58:13,483
Tell her what?

299
00:58:16,952 --> 00:58:18,613
I love you.

300
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:22,870
But I cannot love you.

301
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,311
It was a dream.

302
00:58:49,818 --> 00:58:51,649
Now i am awake.

303
00:58:54,156 --> 00:58:55,817
Look who wandered in.

304
00:58:58,994 --> 00:59:01,326
- What should we do with him?
- Nothing.

305
00:59:03,457 --> 00:59:04,947
He’s mad.

306
00:59:06,293 --> 00:59:07,783
Harmless.

307
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:36,186
It’s yours.

308
00:59:37,157 --> 00:59:38,897
Take it home.

309
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:42,401
Lad.

310
01:00:50,021 --> 01:00:51,932
And withdraw!

311
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:55,811
- March!
- St. George! St. George!

312
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:58,393
- March!
- St. George!

313
01:01:04,786 --> 01:01:06,401
- March!
- St. George!

314
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:08,157
- March!
- St. George!

315
01:01:08,248 --> 01:01:09,488
March!

316
01:01:10,959 --> 01:01:12,665
I let her love me.

317
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:22,338
I made her love me.

318
01:01:25,015 --> 01:01:26,971
And what was your disagreement about?

319
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:30,596
He said today‘s the 15th of October.
I said the 17th.

320
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:32,268
I must.

321
01:01:33,315 --> 01:01:37,524
You were fightin‘
about the date of the year?

322
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:39,067
Damnation is like this.

323
01:01:39,154 --> 01:01:42,146
Didn’t I tell you to dig a new well
farther from the shore?

324
01:01:42,991 --> 01:01:45,073
Why hasn‘t this been done?

325
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:50,199
Every man will stop what he’s doin'
right now and start diggin’ the well!

326
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:52,827
Those of you that cannot
carry the dirt in buckets

327
01:01:52,918 --> 01:01:54,783
shall carry it with your own hands.

328
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:00,918
The labors of honest and industrious men

329
01:02:01,009 --> 01:02:04,547
shall not be consumed
to maintain the idleness of a few.

330
01:02:04,638 --> 01:02:06,879
The country is to them a misery,

331
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:09,589
a death, a hell.

332
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:28,491
While they starve, they dig for gold.

333
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:35,741
There is no talk, no hope,

334
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:37,325
no work but this.

335
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:47,094
If there’s so much gold,
why don’t the Naturals have any?

336
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:49,011
You’re chasin’ a dream.

337
01:02:49,808 --> 01:02:52,094
You see what men they’ve sent us?

338
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:56,098
A headless multitude.
They will not sow corn for their own bellies.

339
01:02:56,189 --> 01:03:00,649
They would rather eat their fish raw than go
a stone’s throw and fetch some wood to dress it.

340
01:03:02,696 --> 01:03:04,061
Bad water.

341
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:06,984
Sturgeon gone.

342
01:03:07,993 --> 01:03:10,029
- The waste cities, they shall live in them.
- Mutterings.

343
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:12,532
They shall plant vineyards
and drink the wine!

344
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:14,112
In that day -

345
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:19,327
Love good and hate evil
and close up the breaches of -

346
01:03:19,421 --> 01:03:24,711
Take away from me the noise
of your music and your songs

347
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:27,292
so I will not hear
the melody of thine harp.

348
01:03:27,387 --> 01:03:29,844
The Lord has given the command
and he will smash them!

349
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:33,264
The large house into pieces
and the small house into bits!

350
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:35,763
Somebody should shoot Small there.

351
01:03:35,854 --> 01:03:38,891
He hasn‘t got a ghost of a chance
and he’ll contaminate us all.

352
01:03:39,691 --> 01:03:43,559
He used Wortham’s spoon.
Now Wortham’s gone. My friend.

353
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:46,478
Have we gotta wait till all is dead?

354
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:09,467
Sir. Ackley‘s dead.

355
01:04:10,472 --> 01:04:12,929
Somebody ate his hands.

356
01:04:14,351 --> 01:04:17,843
Went out in the height of style anyhow.

357
01:04:17,937 --> 01:04:20,679
Such... tranquility.

358
01:04:21,733 --> 01:04:23,439
You’d think he could speak.

359
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:26,518
I shall miss him.
I think we all shall.

360
01:04:31,576 --> 01:04:33,237
We’re 38 now.

361
01:04:51,805 --> 01:04:54,296
To go back up that river.

362
01:04:57,811 --> 01:04:59,972
To lo ve her in the Wild.

363
01:05:09,072 --> 01:05:10,733
What holds you here?

364
01:05:16,996 --> 01:05:19,487
What are your intentions towards her?

365
01:05:23,837 --> 01:05:25,418
Towards them?

366
01:05:33,012 --> 01:05:35,924
There’s nothin’ in the river.
The river’s empty.

367
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:41,430
We wanna go back to England.
Please, can we -

368
01:05:42,856 --> 01:05:45,472
- Where’s Captain Newport?
- There’s nothin’ to eat.

369
01:05:45,567 --> 01:05:48,434
- Captain Newport will be back shortly.
- Does he have food?

370
01:05:48,528 --> 01:05:51,770
- He’d better.
- But when will we go back to England?

371
01:05:51,865 --> 01:05:53,605
They’re eatin’ all the dead.

372
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:55,691
You believe in ghosts, Captain?

373
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:58,652
People don’t care
about those Indians no more.

374
01:06:48,755 --> 01:06:50,495
What’s this?

375
01:07:28,253 --> 01:07:30,369
Don‘t put yourself in danger.

376
01:07:31,756 --> 01:07:35,294
You don’t have to do anything else for us.

377
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:39,339
Why have you not come to me?

378
01:07:53,278 --> 01:07:54,768
I know, my love.

379
01:07:59,951 --> 01:08:01,441
Don’t trust me.

380
01:08:07,584 --> 01:08:09,575
You don’t know who I am.

381
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:36,976
Remember.

382
01:09:11,731 --> 01:09:13,642
Thank you.

383
01:09:18,446 --> 01:09:20,437
May God be with you.

384
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:40,999
Who are you, whom I love?

385
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:55,180
She.

386
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:59,771
Brass touched her hand.

387
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:06,524
- Where are you going?
- Crabs in a bucket

388
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:08,325
Where you would not dare to follow.

389
01:10:08,413 --> 01:10:10,870
Scuttling over each other.

390
01:10:10,957 --> 01:10:12,948
Don‘t you think you should take more men?

391
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:15,078
They can come if they choose.

392
01:10:15,169 --> 01:10:18,002
I will see if we can trade
with another tribe.

393
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:23,423
Be careful, sir.

394
01:10:23,511 --> 01:10:25,467
Is she waiting?

395
01:10:26,597 --> 01:10:28,087
There.

396
01:10:29,934 --> 01:10:32,141
What else is life but living there?

397
01:10:45,491 --> 01:10:47,732
She lay in peace,

398
01:10:47,827 --> 01:10:49,488
gazed at the sky.

399
01:10:53,458 --> 01:10:55,073
Motionless.

400
01:10:58,629 --> 01:11:00,165
Afraid of what I most desire.

401
01:11:01,007 --> 01:11:02,668
Fool, I was.

402
01:11:05,344 --> 01:11:07,426
Stillness.

403
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:11,005
Cannot walk two paths at once.
Lea ve her free.

404
01:11:12,018 --> 01:11:13,758
Can’t deceive the good

405
01:11:13,853 --> 01:11:15,343
Peace.

406
01:11:19,901 --> 01:11:22,392
Without craving or desire.

407
01:11:22,487 --> 01:11:24,443
Cling to the good.

408
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:27,943
As long as you do,
you have a claim on life.

409
01:11:31,704 --> 01:11:33,194
Sail.

410
01:11:36,209 --> 01:11:37,699
Sail on.

411
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:02,557
The source of all evil.

412
01:12:05,446 --> 01:12:07,732
It excuses vulgarity.

413
01:12:07,824 --> 01:12:10,657
Makes wrong right, base noble.

414
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:20,176
There’s something I know when I’m with you
that I forget when I’m away.

415
01:13:22,607 --> 01:13:24,143
Tell me, my love,

416
01:13:25,568 --> 01:13:28,856
did you wish for me to come back
and live with you again?

417
01:13:58,100 --> 01:13:59,681
True.

418
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:02,347
Shut your eyes.

419
01:14:08,611 --> 01:14:10,602
Is this the man I love?

420
01:14:12,031 --> 01:14:13,521
So long.

421
01:14:16,243 --> 01:14:17,733
A ghost.

422
01:14:23,209 --> 01:14:24,699
Come.

423
01:14:30,841 --> 01:14:32,832
Where are you, my love?

424
01:14:44,271 --> 01:14:45,761
Free.

425
01:14:56,659 --> 01:14:58,650
What do i fear?

426
01:15:08,462 --> 01:15:10,293
Can love lie?

427
01:15:18,472 --> 01:15:19,962
You.

428
01:15:29,442 --> 01:15:31,603
We can‘t go into the forest.

429
01:15:34,655 --> 01:15:36,646
Could I show you England?

430
01:15:40,453 --> 01:15:42,614
No, it‘s too far.

431
01:15:45,916 --> 01:15:47,907
If I can be with you...

432
01:15:53,049 --> 01:15:54,710
that is all.

433
01:16:45,017 --> 01:16:46,928
That fort is not the world

434
01:16:53,067 --> 01:16:55,183
The river leads back there.

435
01:16:57,363 --> 01:16:59,945
It leads onward too,

436
01:17:00,032 --> 01:17:01,738
deeper...

437
01:17:04,328 --> 01:17:06,114
into the Wild.

438
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:11,365
Start over.

439
01:17:16,215 --> 01:17:19,548
Exchange this false life for a true one.

440
01:17:22,763 --> 01:17:24,879
Give up the name of Smith.

441
01:17:53,544 --> 01:17:55,205
What are you doing here?

442
01:17:56,547 --> 01:18:00,131
Beg your pardon, sir.
You were gone longer than we expected.

443
01:18:00,759 --> 01:18:02,920
Appears I‘ve wandered off myself a bit.

444
01:18:11,187 --> 01:18:12,677
No ties.

445
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:19,645
Space enough at last...

446
01:18:19,737 --> 01:18:21,728
to break free.

447
01:18:22,990 --> 01:18:25,276
Can I lead them off some other way?

448
01:18:28,537 --> 01:18:29,526
Later

449
01:18:35,836 --> 01:18:39,044
What about the soil, Captain?
Is it as good as we thought?

450
01:18:39,131 --> 01:18:40,587
Later.

451
01:18:40,674 --> 01:18:42,210
- Not really.
- Always alone.

452
01:18:42,301 --> 01:18:45,418
- In fact, I‘ve rarely seen such a pest hole.
- No.

453
01:18:45,512 --> 01:18:47,468
Look about you. Everything's swamp.

454
01:18:47,556 --> 01:18:50,798
With water standing in lakes and pools
so the ground gives way beneath your feet.

455
01:18:50,893 --> 01:18:52,383
Let the dead bury the dead.

456
01:18:52,478 --> 01:18:54,389
I suspect there’s more puddles
than dry land.

457
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:57,688
Each producing more mosquitoes in their slime
than there are beads in a nunnery,

458
01:18:57,775 --> 01:19:00,733
and each mosquito is hungry as a priest.

459
01:19:00,819 --> 01:19:03,185
None but a savage could inhabit the place.

460
01:19:04,657 --> 01:19:07,774
But west of here,
towards the mountains, or south,

461
01:19:07,868 --> 01:19:09,483
that is something else.

462
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:11,114
- The deep, dark pool
- We can sail on.

463
01:19:11,205 --> 01:19:12,615
- Come,
- Seek a passage.

464
01:19:12,706 --> 01:19:14,196
My love.

465
01:19:16,126 --> 01:19:17,832
It flows.

466
01:19:20,172 --> 01:19:22,163
Where .7 Life.

467
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:28,218
Are you true?

468
01:19:28,305 --> 01:19:30,591
Me, in your soul

469
01:19:31,684 --> 01:19:32,844
Life.

470
01:19:35,604 --> 01:19:37,469
Am I a deceiver?

471
01:19:38,482 --> 01:19:40,313
My mouth is dry.

472
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:46,270
My body trembles.

473
01:19:48,867 --> 01:19:50,323
Shall I let myself go?

474
01:19:50,411 --> 01:19:52,447
- My skin burns.
- Trust

475
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:56,951
- How false I am.
- I have two minds.

476
01:19:59,586 --> 01:20:02,202
Wait Should i tell Father?

477
01:20:03,507 --> 01:20:05,293
There’s nothing but this.

478
01:20:06,302 --> 01:20:07,792
Not yet.

479
01:20:10,055 --> 01:20:11,886
What was i?

480
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:18,302
What am i now?

481
01:20:21,066 --> 01:20:22,727
Oh, Mother,

482
01:20:24,194 --> 01:20:26,150
What have I done?

483
01:20:26,238 --> 01:20:28,900
Love has unbound my limbs.

484
01:20:34,496 --> 01:20:37,238
This love is hire pain.

485
01:20:39,293 --> 01:20:41,579
I am.

486
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:43,331
I shall be...

487
01:20:44,757 --> 01:20:46,247
yours.

488
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:09,580
Come away.

489
01:22:14,096 --> 01:22:16,087
You must tell me why.

490
01:22:19,268 --> 01:22:23,432
- They can’t hear. I've sent ’em away.
- He sees you mean to stay.

491
01:22:34,533 --> 01:22:36,194
They're coming.

492
01:22:41,498 --> 01:22:43,705
Make peace with him.

493
01:22:43,792 --> 01:22:45,623
He won’t accept peace.

494
01:22:46,545 --> 01:22:48,206
Why would he?

495
01:22:56,263 --> 01:22:59,050
- Come away.
- Where would we live?

496
01:23:01,727 --> 01:23:03,217
In the woods?

497
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:08,268
In a treetop?
A hole in the ground?

498
01:23:28,879 --> 01:23:32,497
You have to come with me... into the fort.

499
01:23:32,591 --> 01:23:36,083
Your people will know you came here.
They’ll find out soon enough.

500
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:28,195
Go! On the double, gentlemen!

501
01:25:28,290 --> 01:25:29,951
God save the king!

502
01:25:30,042 --> 01:25:32,954
- Port your pikes!
- God save the king!

503
01:25:33,045 --> 01:25:36,788
- Port your pikes!
- God save the king!

504
01:25:36,882 --> 01:25:38,372
Charge!

505
01:25:38,467 --> 01:25:41,630
And on the Swiss step, gentlemen,

506
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:42,960
march!

507
01:25:43,055 --> 01:25:46,468
St. George! St. George! St. George!

508
01:25:46,558 --> 01:25:48,469
Prepare to stand!

509
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:50,141
- Stand!
- St. George!

510
01:25:50,228 --> 01:25:51,889
Musketeers advance!

511
01:25:54,024 --> 01:25:55,514
Fire!

512
01:26:07,871 --> 01:26:09,236
Company -

513
01:26:14,586 --> 01:26:18,204
Hold the ground! Hold together, men!

514
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:19,741
- You’re like a herd of deer!
- What are you waiting for?

515
01:28:19,836 --> 01:28:21,622
How can you own land?

516
01:28:21,713 --> 01:28:24,455
This earth was made for such
as shall improve it!

517
01:28:24,549 --> 01:28:28,041
As knows how to live!

518
01:28:28,136 --> 01:28:30,718
They have no sound, sir,
but I - I couldn’t -

519
01:28:30,806 --> 01:28:32,592
Fire on him!

520
01:28:32,682 --> 01:28:36,140
What are you waiting for? Fire on him!

521
01:28:36,228 --> 01:28:39,140
You heathen bastards!

522
01:28:39,231 --> 01:28:40,311
Please.

523
01:28:41,566 --> 01:28:43,682
Seeds of sulphur!

524
01:28:43,777 --> 01:28:46,644
Sons of fire!
Devils from the mouth of hell!

525
01:29:00,669 --> 01:29:03,627
Retreat! Fall back!

526
01:29:26,736 --> 01:29:30,729
Lord, turn not away thy face.

527
01:29:38,248 --> 01:29:40,614
You desire not the death of a sinner.

528
01:29:42,752 --> 01:29:44,743
We have gone away from you.

529
01:29:47,799 --> 01:29:50,586
I have not harkened to your voice.

530
01:29:53,305 --> 01:29:55,136
Let us not be brought to nothing.

531
01:29:55,223 --> 01:29:57,464
- Gather reinforcements!
- They‘re climbing up the wall!

532
01:32:46,311 --> 01:32:48,302
The water is poisoned.

533
01:32:49,397 --> 01:32:52,104
They put a dead dog in the well.

534
01:32:53,443 --> 01:32:56,025
We can’t go out to look for fish or game.

535
01:33:01,076 --> 01:33:03,067
How long can we last?

536
01:33:06,247 --> 01:33:08,533
Starvation does fearful things to a man.

537
01:33:08,625 --> 01:33:10,411
I hate your hearts.

538
01:33:10,502 --> 01:33:13,244
I’m not entirely sure I should have
the use of this hand again.

539
01:33:13,338 --> 01:33:15,454
You see my value
as the carcasses of unburied men.

540
01:33:15,548 --> 01:33:18,790
There’s something you’re not telling us,
and I got a right to know.

541
01:33:18,885 --> 01:33:20,750
Tired of your contempt

542
01:33:20,845 --> 01:33:22,836
What have you done to them?

543
01:33:22,931 --> 01:33:25,889
- You don’t know where you are.
- There's something you’re not telling us.

544
01:33:28,019 --> 01:33:30,101
Like a wasp in a bottle.

545
01:33:31,940 --> 01:33:33,350
Trapped

546
01:33:33,441 --> 01:33:35,602
To give light to them.

547
01:33:35,693 --> 01:33:37,809
Deliver us from evil

548
01:33:37,904 --> 01:33:39,860
Not sit in darkness.

549
01:33:41,533 --> 01:33:43,865
Deal not with us alter our sins.

550
01:33:46,538 --> 01:33:48,153
All thy people.

551
01:33:48,248 --> 01:33:51,832
I have become, as it were,
a monster unto many.

552
01:33:53,294 --> 01:33:55,376
Cast me not away.

553
01:33:59,050 --> 01:34:01,041
Make me a clean heart

554
01:34:42,969 --> 01:34:44,630
Tell him.

555
01:34:44,721 --> 01:34:46,507
The princess is up the river at Pastancy.

556
01:34:46,598 --> 01:34:48,304
They sent her to her uncle, Patawomeck,

557
01:34:48,391 --> 01:34:52,350
lord of the naked devils of that region,
and, by the by, an acquaintance of mine.

558
01:34:52,437 --> 01:34:55,645
So I get talkin’ to his nibs,
and he proposes to sell her.

559
01:34:55,732 --> 01:34:59,065
He says with her at the fort,
the emperor will not dare attack us.

560
01:34:59,152 --> 01:35:01,939
- He dates on her.
- You’re certain she’s the one you saw?

561
01:35:02,030 --> 01:35:05,693
With these eyes.
I spoke to the king directly.

562
01:35:05,783 --> 01:35:08,195
And what does this rogue
propose to sell her for?

563
01:35:08,286 --> 01:35:10,948
I was getting to that.
His most favorite thing is combs.

564
01:35:11,039 --> 01:35:14,372
But in this case, he seems
to have his heart set on a kettle.

565
01:35:14,459 --> 01:35:17,667
You know, a copper kettle
like my mother had for makin’ stew.

566
01:35:17,754 --> 01:35:20,962
What use he means to make
of the instrument, I cannot say.

567
01:35:24,385 --> 01:35:26,216
Well?

568
01:35:26,304 --> 01:35:30,013
We don't take hostages.
King James would not approve.

569
01:35:30,099 --> 01:35:33,432
- You’d rather see us annihilated?
- She’s done enough for us.

570
01:35:34,812 --> 01:35:37,474
She risked the beating out
of her own brains to save mine.

571
01:35:37,565 --> 01:35:39,055
Come, Argall, threaten me!

572
01:35:39,150 --> 01:35:41,732
Had she not fed us,
you would have starved.

573
01:35:41,819 --> 01:35:43,559
Then I’d know I was gonna live
for a thousand years.

574
01:35:43,655 --> 01:35:46,362
She‘s been the instrument
to preserve this colony from disaster.

575
01:35:46,449 --> 01:35:50,033
We’ll not return her kindness
by making her a captive.

576
01:35:50,119 --> 01:35:53,452
She and her lot are on the verge
of killing us all.

577
01:35:56,167 --> 01:36:00,251
I expect there will be scarce a handful alive
when the boats return, if they ever do.

578
01:36:01,464 --> 01:36:04,706
You told us yourself that her father
regards her as no one else.

579
01:36:09,013 --> 01:36:12,346
Or do you have private reasons
for this attitude of yours?

580
01:36:16,229 --> 01:36:18,185
Return to your post.

581
01:36:22,568 --> 01:36:25,981
The penalty for disobeyin’ an order
of the president is hanging.

582
01:36:26,072 --> 01:36:27,858
You’re breakin’ the laws.

583
01:36:27,949 --> 01:36:30,235
This is mutiny.

584
01:36:30,326 --> 01:36:31,862
Me breaking the laws.

585
01:36:35,915 --> 01:36:37,951
I have information Smith here...

586
01:36:39,335 --> 01:36:43,203
is planning to marry the wench
and make himself king of Virginia.

587
01:36:57,395 --> 01:36:59,977
You’re no longer in command, Smitty.

588
01:37:00,064 --> 01:37:02,931
I shall wear the medal now.

589
01:37:03,026 --> 01:37:05,608
You've been derelict
in your duties to the king.

590
01:37:05,695 --> 01:37:07,936
You’ve betrayed these citizens
of Jamestown.

591
01:37:09,032 --> 01:37:13,275
I, therefore, pronounce you unworthy
of being a member of this colony.

592
01:37:13,369 --> 01:37:15,155
You’re no longer in command, Smitty!

593
01:37:15,246 --> 01:37:18,704
Oh, oh! High and mighty.

594
01:37:18,791 --> 01:37:21,248
Lord and ruler. Huh?

595
01:37:21,336 --> 01:37:23,122
No! No!

596
01:37:23,212 --> 01:37:25,373
We must have order, huh?

597
01:37:25,465 --> 01:37:29,549
We can’t have everyone runnin’ around
givin’ themselves airs and graces,

598
01:37:29,635 --> 01:37:32,047
’cause then -
then we would have chaos, huh?

599
01:37:32,597 --> 01:37:35,179
- Scream.
- Come near.

600
01:37:35,266 --> 01:37:37,257
- Gettin‘ the strokes.
- Come near me.

601
01:37:37,352 --> 01:37:39,843
You say - You say,
“Friend. Friend, dear friend.

602
01:37:39,937 --> 01:37:43,054
- You touch me now.
- I pray to the gods for your good health.

603
01:37:43,149 --> 01:37:45,606
For the rest of my life, I will." Yeah?

604
01:37:49,113 --> 01:37:51,354
In all things -

605
01:37:51,449 --> 01:37:53,440
may Island by you.

606
01:37:53,534 --> 01:37:55,195
Put him to hard labor.

607
01:37:56,454 --> 01:38:00,447
Send him to the forest
to hew fresh timbers for the walls.

608
01:38:03,336 --> 01:38:05,702
Set him by the heels each night
when he’s done,

609
01:38:05,797 --> 01:38:08,914
that through the long watches,
he might reflect on his transgressions.

610
01:39:30,047 --> 01:39:34,131
Buckets now! Look behind you!

611
01:39:36,762 --> 01:39:38,753
He got me with a spear!

612
01:39:39,390 --> 01:39:42,757
Back up.
And you are a futile, barking dog!

613
01:39:48,566 --> 01:39:50,397
Oh, Mother,

614
01:39:50,485 --> 01:39:52,601
has he sent this ship for me?

615
01:40:01,412 --> 01:40:03,698
Conscience is a nuisance.

616
01:40:05,291 --> 01:40:06,781
A fly.

617
01:40:07,877 --> 01:40:10,368
A barking dog.

618
01:40:11,714 --> 01:40:13,830
If you don’t believe you have one,

619
01:40:13,925 --> 01:40:16,166
what trouble can it be to you?

620
01:40:32,193 --> 01:40:33,683
Mother...

621
01:40:35,404 --> 01:40:37,736
you are my strength...

622
01:40:39,951 --> 01:40:42,442
or I have none.

623
01:41:03,099 --> 01:41:05,431
Throw us your forward line!

624
01:41:11,399 --> 01:41:13,390
The president.

625
01:41:13,484 --> 01:41:15,566
Yes, I neglected to tell you.

626
01:41:17,029 --> 01:41:19,691
The captain’s
no longer occupying that post.

627
01:41:20,658 --> 01:41:23,741
He will be able to explain
the reasons better than I.

628
01:42:03,909 --> 01:42:05,570
It’s the princess.

629
01:42:15,630 --> 01:42:17,416
This will be your house, milady.

630
01:42:17,506 --> 01:42:19,588
Reverend Whitaker,
the one what lived here, well,

631
01:42:19,675 --> 01:42:21,836
he’s dead and gone now, so...

632
01:43:45,302 --> 01:43:48,385
The ships returned, firing their cannons -

633
01:43:48,472 --> 01:43:51,214
causing the Naturals to sue for peace.

634
01:45:13,557 --> 01:45:15,923
They said they were goin’ to fetch you.

635
01:45:17,061 --> 01:45:18,722
I was against it.

636
01:45:38,749 --> 01:45:40,740
I didn’t wanna harm you.

637
01:45:42,419 --> 01:45:44,080
And now there’s disaster all around us.

638
01:45:44,171 --> 01:45:46,833
We should have stopped
before it was too late.

639
01:46:18,455 --> 01:46:20,537
What is light?

640
01:46:20,624 --> 01:46:22,114
Give.

641
01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:25,292
Wrong? Who is this man?

642
01:46:29,300 --> 01:46:30,790
Now...

643
01:46:32,803 --> 01:46:34,668
all is perfect.

644
01:46:34,763 --> 01:46:36,628
Let me be lost.

645
01:46:36,724 --> 01:46:38,214
True.

646
01:46:39,226 --> 01:46:41,262
You flow through me...

647
01:46:43,856 --> 01:46:45,767
like a river.

648
01:46:49,570 --> 01:46:51,060
Come.

649
01:46:52,781 --> 01:46:54,237
Follow me.

650
01:47:08,005 --> 01:47:09,916
Thank thee, O Lord.

651
01:47:30,027 --> 01:47:31,517
Very well.

652
01:47:33,072 --> 01:47:34,562
Leave us alone.

653
01:47:37,952 --> 01:47:40,785
You wish to bring charges
against this man?

654
01:47:40,871 --> 01:47:42,987
Are you sure?

655
01:47:43,082 --> 01:47:45,824
Well, fine then, Argall.
Enough of your quarrels. Be off.

656
01:47:55,219 --> 01:47:57,210
I have news for you.

657
01:47:58,681 --> 01:48:02,219
The king wants you to return to England

658
01:48:02,309 --> 01:48:05,142
to prepare an expedition of your own

659
01:48:05,229 --> 01:48:07,891
to chart the northern coasts

660
01:48:07,982 --> 01:48:10,974
to see if you might find
a passage to the indies.

661
01:48:12,820 --> 01:48:15,653
I remember when you had sight
and ambition.

662
01:48:15,739 --> 01:48:17,900
Shall you not press on?

663
01:48:19,201 --> 01:48:24,446
Shall you be a discoverer of passages
which you yourself refused to explore,

664
01:48:24,540 --> 01:48:27,282
beyond the threshold, that is?

665
01:48:29,461 --> 01:48:31,622
The king has great hopes for you.

666
01:48:32,756 --> 01:48:34,246
Plans.

667
01:48:38,303 --> 01:48:41,215
Um, she‘s to take care of you now.

668
01:48:41,306 --> 01:48:45,174
Uh, my name’s Mary,
and yours, I believe, is, uh -

669
01:48:45,269 --> 01:48:48,261
Oh, no. Um, she says
that’s not her name anymore.

670
01:48:48,355 --> 01:48:50,471
She hasn’t got a name.

671
01:48:50,566 --> 01:48:52,431
How unfortunate.

672
01:48:52,526 --> 01:48:55,063
Well, we shall have to give you one.

673
01:49:06,707 --> 01:49:08,197
Here.

674
01:49:12,171 --> 01:49:14,537
Rub with the towel.

675
01:49:14,631 --> 01:49:17,873
I will find joy in all I see.

676
01:49:18,886 --> 01:49:20,968
- Where am I going?
- Mother.

677
01:49:22,723 --> 01:49:24,805
- Fast.
- Little steps.

678
01:49:26,477 --> 01:49:28,342
- So fast
- I want my love.

679
01:49:28,437 --> 01:49:29,927
Oh.

680
01:49:31,982 --> 01:49:33,563
To go to him.

681
01:49:33,650 --> 01:49:35,891
- The river.
- Living water.

682
01:49:35,986 --> 01:49:37,772
To meet him.

683
01:49:38,781 --> 01:49:40,772
Where does it come from?

684
01:49:43,243 --> 01:49:44,733
Where is it going?

685
01:49:44,828 --> 01:49:46,819
Why do they want gold?

686
01:49:49,500 --> 01:49:51,411
Can’t they make it?

687
01:49:56,215 --> 01:49:57,921
Do they eat it?

688
01:49:58,008 --> 01:50:01,171
...and our land,
but our eternal birthright.

689
01:50:01,261 --> 01:50:03,798
Look beyond these gates.

690
01:50:03,889 --> 01:50:05,550
Eden lies about us still.

691
01:50:06,517 --> 01:50:09,179
We have escaped the Old World
and its bondage.

692
01:50:10,687 --> 01:50:15,807
Let us make a new beginning
and create a fresh example for humanity.

693
01:50:15,901 --> 01:50:18,938
We are the pioneers of the world,

694
01:50:19,029 --> 01:50:21,816
the advance guard
sent on through the wilderness

695
01:50:21,907 --> 01:50:23,898
to break a new path.

696
01:50:26,286 --> 01:50:30,450
In our youth is our strength,
in our inexperience our wisdom.

697
01:50:31,500 --> 01:50:34,583
God has given us a promised land,

698
01:50:34,670 --> 01:50:36,752
a great inheritance.

699
01:50:36,839 --> 01:50:40,832
Woe betide
if ever we turn our back on him.

700
01:50:42,177 --> 01:50:47,968
Let us prepare a land where a man
may rise to his true stature.

701
01:50:48,058 --> 01:50:50,390
A land of the future.

702
01:50:50,477 --> 01:50:53,310
A new kingdom of the spirit.

703
01:50:54,231 --> 01:50:57,223
Remember what this country was...

704
01:51:39,818 --> 01:51:42,230
Am I as you hire?

705
01:51:46,158 --> 01:51:47,648
His eyes...

706
01:51:54,124 --> 01:51:59,209
You knew me as I was long ago.

707
01:52:02,174 --> 01:52:05,337
I have never truly been the man
I seem to you to be.

708
01:52:05,427 --> 01:52:07,668
What does he say?

709
01:52:08,472 --> 01:52:10,963
Come. Let’s sit by the river.

710
01:52:12,893 --> 01:52:14,383
Mean?

711
01:52:19,149 --> 01:52:21,936
I can’t sleep till I see you again.

712
01:52:22,945 --> 01:52:24,151
Look up.

713
01:52:26,949 --> 01:52:29,565
You have no evil in you.

714
01:52:31,578 --> 01:52:33,569
I belong to you.

715
01:52:43,966 --> 01:52:46,548
He knows.

716
01:52:53,850 --> 01:52:56,216
Where am I?

717
01:53:13,203 --> 01:53:14,909
Wait two months,

718
01:53:16,206 --> 01:53:17,867
then tell her I am dead.

719
01:53:19,042 --> 01:53:20,532
Drowned.

720
01:55:00,977 --> 01:55:02,638
Like that.

721
01:55:12,697 --> 01:55:16,064
He's left you, Princess.

722
01:55:16,159 --> 01:55:18,400
He told you a pack of lies.

723
01:55:18,495 --> 01:55:20,702
Forget about him.

724
01:55:39,766 --> 01:55:42,508
I, uh, have some terrible news.

725
01:55:45,439 --> 01:55:48,602
Captain Smith is dead.
He drowned in the crossing.

726
01:55:52,612 --> 01:55:54,523
He loved you very much.

727
01:56:40,911 --> 01:56:42,242
Unwed.

728
01:56:45,415 --> 01:56:47,406
Where is your lo ve now?

729
01:56:54,925 --> 01:56:56,665
Where is our child?

730
01:57:03,934 --> 01:57:07,722
You have gone away with my life.

731
01:57:13,777 --> 01:57:15,768
Killed the god in me.

732
01:57:59,489 --> 01:58:01,480
The dogs come about us.

733
01:58:05,370 --> 01:58:06,826
Like wolves,

734
01:58:06,913 --> 01:58:09,575
they devour our soul

735
01:58:16,756 --> 01:58:18,667
Does the sun see this?

736
01:58:22,846 --> 01:58:24,427
Save us.

737
01:58:26,057 --> 01:58:27,888
Despise us not.

738
01:58:34,107 --> 01:58:36,473
Man cannot spoil it.

739
01:58:40,363 --> 01:58:42,399
He vanishes like the dew

740
01:58:46,411 --> 01:58:49,198
On the bed of fate, we lie,

741
01:59:06,473 --> 01:59:08,134
We can enter you.

742
01:59:12,020 --> 01:59:13,510
Question you.

743
01:59:22,489 --> 01:59:23,979
I mourn.

744
01:59:26,451 --> 01:59:27,941
I grieve.

745
01:59:32,332 --> 01:59:34,243
Take my hand, Father

746
02:00:41,901 --> 02:00:43,391
Scorned.

747
02:00:44,821 --> 02:00:46,982
- Cast out.
- Cut off

748
02:00:48,533 --> 02:00:50,023
A dog.

749
02:00:55,707 --> 02:00:57,698
Come, death,

750
02:00:59,294 --> 02:01:00,784
Take me.

751
02:01:03,590 --> 02:01:05,376
Set me free.

752
02:01:10,805 --> 02:01:12,796
Let me be what I was.

753
02:05:00,660 --> 02:05:02,651
When first I saw her,

754
02:05:02,745 --> 02:05:05,236
she was regarded as someone finished

755
02:05:06,332 --> 02:05:08,493
Broken. Lost.

756
02:05:18,469 --> 02:05:21,006
She seemed barely to notice
the others about her.

757
02:05:46,497 --> 02:05:49,785
Um, I would like to spend
the afternoon with you.

758
02:05:54,505 --> 02:05:56,336
How do I ask?

759
02:06:01,804 --> 02:06:06,423
A nature like yours
can turn trouble into good.

760
02:06:07,977 --> 02:06:11,265
All this sorrow will give you strength

761
02:06:11,355 --> 02:06:13,641
and point you on a higher way.

762
02:06:15,401 --> 02:06:19,770
Think of a tree -
how it grows round its wounds.

763
02:06:20,573 --> 02:06:24,065
If a branch breaks off, it don’t stop,

764
02:06:24,160 --> 02:06:27,698
but keeps reaching towards the light.

765
02:06:29,624 --> 02:06:32,661
We must meet misfortune boldly

766
02:06:32,752 --> 02:06:35,164
and not suffer it to frighten us.

767
02:06:36,297 --> 02:06:38,709
We must act the play out,

768
02:06:38,800 --> 02:06:42,509
then live our troubles down, my lady.

769
02:06:55,274 --> 02:06:59,062
April, May and June,

770
02:06:59,153 --> 02:07:01,360
July, August.

771
02:07:01,447 --> 02:07:04,735
- What is a day?
- A day?

772
02:07:04,826 --> 02:07:06,942
An hour?

773
02:07:07,036 --> 02:07:09,368
An hour is 60 minutes.

774
02:07:11,374 --> 02:07:13,865
Why does the Earth have colors?

775
02:07:40,278 --> 02:07:42,940
Many passions have I endured.

776
02:07:43,990 --> 02:07:45,230
Daily.

777
02:07:45,324 --> 02:07:46,814
Hourly.

778
02:07:48,536 --> 02:07:50,367
Even in my sleep.

779
02:07:52,790 --> 02:07:55,907
Awaking me to astonishment.

780
02:07:56,002 --> 02:07:58,334
This love has become...

781
02:07:59,422 --> 02:08:01,083
such a labyrinth...

782
02:08:01,924 --> 02:08:03,835
that I no longer know -

783
02:08:03,926 --> 02:08:06,884
- Were you sad -
- how to wind myself out from it.

784
02:08:06,971 --> 02:08:09,087
to lose your wife and daughter?

785
02:08:17,023 --> 02:08:18,513
Name this person.

786
02:08:18,608 --> 02:08:20,473
Rebecca.

787
02:08:20,568 --> 02:08:25,653
Rebecca, I baptize thee in the name
of the Father and the Son

788
02:08:25,740 --> 02:08:27,276
and the Holy Ghost.

789
02:08:27,366 --> 02:08:28,856
Amen.

790
02:08:34,123 --> 02:08:36,785
She has accepted my invitation
to work in the fields.

791
02:08:36,876 --> 02:08:38,457
For Rebecca.

792
02:08:38,544 --> 02:08:40,250
She’ll be missed.

793
02:08:40,338 --> 02:08:43,000
She understands the culture of tobacco.

794
02:08:43,090 --> 02:08:45,001
She’s a good lass.

795
02:08:48,679 --> 02:08:51,136
The people were sorry at her going.

796
02:10:08,050 --> 02:10:09,631
Hours pass.

797
02:10:11,053 --> 02:10:13,715
She speaks not a word.

798
02:11:01,729 --> 02:11:03,435
Who are you?

799
02:11:07,109 --> 02:11:09,100
What do you dream of?

800
02:11:11,739 --> 02:11:13,650
We’re like grass.

801
02:11:31,926 --> 02:11:33,757
Are you kind?

802
02:12:26,814 --> 02:12:29,100
She weaves all things together.

803
02:12:35,990 --> 02:12:37,981
I touched her long ago...

804
02:12:39,201 --> 02:12:41,192
without knowing her name.

805
02:13:02,224 --> 02:13:04,180
All sings to her.

806
02:13:22,870 --> 02:13:25,612
Suppose I asked you to marry me.
What would you say?

807
02:13:31,253 --> 02:13:33,244
Are you asking me?

808
02:13:36,634 --> 02:13:38,841
Where would we live?

809
02:13:38,928 --> 02:13:40,418
Here.

810
02:13:41,764 --> 02:13:43,720
England, if you wish.

811
02:13:43,807 --> 02:13:45,968
Perhaps that would be best.
We could...

812
02:13:46,852 --> 02:13:49,514
Well, you could forget your life
in this place.

813
02:14:05,329 --> 02:14:07,570
Why do you shrink from me?

814
02:14:12,503 --> 02:14:14,494
Won’t you say yes?

815
02:14:21,303 --> 02:14:22,793
If you like.

816
02:14:26,559 --> 02:14:29,141
This isn’t what I expected,

817
02:14:29,228 --> 02:14:30,684
Rebecca.

818
02:14:32,481 --> 02:14:33,971
I’m sorry.

819
02:14:36,652 --> 02:14:38,768
Why are you crying?

820
02:14:43,492 --> 02:14:44,982
I suppose...

821
02:14:46,704 --> 02:14:48,990
I must be happy.

822
02:14:51,792 --> 02:14:53,783
You do not love me now.

823
02:14:55,004 --> 02:14:56,710
Someday you will.

824
02:15:10,769 --> 02:15:12,680
You’re not ignorant
to the heavy displeasure

825
02:15:12,771 --> 02:15:15,763
which Almighty God conceived
against the sons of Levi and Israel

826
02:15:15,858 --> 02:15:17,940
for marrying strange wives.

827
02:15:19,862 --> 02:15:21,818
No.

828
02:15:21,905 --> 02:15:25,147
Would you do anything necessary
to bring this about?

829
02:15:25,242 --> 02:15:26,857
Yes, sir.

830
02:15:31,123 --> 02:15:33,455
Would you write a petition

831
02:15:33,542 --> 02:15:35,578
explaining, as the wealthiest
planter in Virginia -

832
02:15:35,669 --> 02:15:37,455
The governor requires of me a letter -

833
02:15:37,546 --> 02:15:41,835
- the benefit this would offer the colony?
- stating acceptable reasons for our union.

834
02:15:41,925 --> 02:15:45,213
Could you state your hope that this
might be the beginning of the great work

835
02:15:45,304 --> 02:15:46,794
of converting the Naturals,

836
02:15:46,889 --> 02:15:49,926
that this idea came to you in no way
through any carnal affection,

837
02:15:51,185 --> 02:15:55,645
but for the good of the plantation,
for the honor of your country

838
02:15:55,731 --> 02:15:58,518
and your own soul?

839
02:15:59,360 --> 02:16:00,816
Humiliated.

840
02:16:00,903 --> 02:16:02,814
In service of saving
the non-believing creature -

841
02:16:02,905 --> 02:16:05,066
And yet it does not touch me.

842
02:16:06,158 --> 02:16:10,401
If this be not your true intent,
would you do that?

843
02:16:12,790 --> 02:16:14,280
Yes.

844
02:16:15,417 --> 02:16:19,376
Then surely you do love her, Mr. Rolfe.

845
02:16:24,635 --> 02:16:25,624
Write.

846
02:16:41,318 --> 02:16:43,104
I require and charge you,

847
02:16:43,195 --> 02:16:46,779
as you will answer
on the dreadful day of judgment,

848
02:16:46,865 --> 02:16:50,198
when the secrets of all hearts
are disclosed

849
02:16:52,204 --> 02:16:54,991
that if you know any impediment

850
02:16:55,082 --> 02:16:58,745
why you should not be lawfully
joined together in matrimony -

851
02:16:59,753 --> 02:17:01,414
you Will confess it

852
02:18:16,330 --> 02:18:17,820
Mother.

853
02:18:19,166 --> 02:18:21,578
Why can I not feel as I should?

854
02:18:26,006 --> 02:18:27,496
Must.

855
02:18:34,431 --> 02:18:38,515
Once false, I must not be again.

856
02:18:44,274 --> 02:18:46,265
Take out the thorn.

857
02:18:56,995 --> 02:18:59,327
Oh!

858
02:19:01,124 --> 02:19:03,365
He is like a tree.

859
02:19:05,963 --> 02:19:07,954
He shelters me.

860
02:19:11,343 --> 02:19:13,379
I lie in his shade.

861
02:19:32,614 --> 02:19:34,605
Can I ignore my heart?

862
02:19:44,668 --> 02:19:46,329
What is from you...

863
02:19:47,379 --> 02:19:49,290
and what is not?

864
02:20:17,576 --> 02:20:20,488
Great Sun, I offer you thanks.

865
02:20:22,247 --> 02:20:25,956
You give life to the trees and hills.

866
02:20:28,837 --> 02:20:30,919
To the streams of water.

867
02:20:34,676 --> 02:20:36,257
To all.

868
02:21:02,371 --> 02:21:03,861
Mother.

869
02:21:05,290 --> 02:21:08,623
Your lo ve is before my eyes.

870
02:21:13,215 --> 02:21:15,171
Show me your way.

871
02:21:18,637 --> 02:21:20,548
Teach me your paths.

872
02:21:26,395 --> 02:21:29,558
Give me a humble heart.

873
02:21:30,565 --> 02:21:32,556
We’ve had some surprising news.

874
02:21:34,069 --> 02:21:35,775
We ’ve been invited to England -

875
02:21:35,862 --> 02:21:38,444
by the king and queen.

876
02:21:41,827 --> 02:21:45,820
There will be a royal audience
in your honor.

877
02:21:48,291 --> 02:21:50,031
You’re known to them all.

878
02:23:15,837 --> 02:23:19,329
His first mate gave him up
to pirates when his ship was stopped.

879
02:23:21,051 --> 02:23:23,042
Five years!

880
02:23:27,182 --> 02:23:29,719
All them ships
went off to Newfoundland. Yes.

881
02:23:31,186 --> 02:23:33,893
He poked around the north.
Then he went home.

882
02:23:33,980 --> 02:23:35,766
Captain Smith.

883
02:23:36,691 --> 02:23:38,522
Yeah, he can make you laugh.

884
02:23:39,402 --> 02:23:42,109
Things are different now.

885
02:23:42,197 --> 02:23:44,108
They’ve sent him back to London.

886
02:23:44,199 --> 02:23:47,157
What a shame.
They say he’s done much for this place.

887
02:23:51,873 --> 02:23:54,034
Captain Smith is alive?

888
02:23:57,879 --> 02:23:59,540
You saw him?

889
02:25:01,735 --> 02:25:03,646
I cannot do that.

890
02:25:04,487 --> 02:25:05,977
Why not?

891
02:25:07,616 --> 02:25:11,609
It would mean something I do not feel.

892
02:25:13,038 --> 02:25:14,949
What’s come over you?

893
02:25:18,210 --> 02:25:21,452
I’m married... to him.

894
02:25:23,256 --> 02:25:24,746
He lives.

895
02:25:25,759 --> 02:25:27,750
I heard it by the fort.

896
02:25:28,970 --> 02:25:30,631
He’s still alive.

897
02:25:35,685 --> 02:25:37,550
“Married”?

898
02:25:37,646 --> 02:25:40,888
You don't know the meaning
of the word exactly.

899
02:25:43,318 --> 02:25:44,979
But I am.

900
02:26:04,214 --> 02:26:06,375
Sweet Wife.

901
02:26:11,638 --> 02:26:13,629
Love made the bond.

902
02:26:15,183 --> 02:26:17,925
Love can break it too.

903
02:26:41,209 --> 02:26:45,327
There is that in her I shall not know.

904
02:28:24,479 --> 02:28:28,848
I’m sorry. This can’t be mine.

905
02:29:10,984 --> 02:29:13,566
Keep a steady hand.

906
02:29:23,246 --> 02:29:24,907
Stand aside!

907
02:30:41,449 --> 02:30:46,534
“...whilst towering in the azure sky,
they celebrate this happy day.

908
02:30:46,621 --> 02:30:49,363
Let rolling streams their gladness show

909
02:30:49,457 --> 02:30:52,290
with gentle murmurs whilst they play,

910
02:30:52,377 --> 02:30:55,210
and in their wild meanders flow,

911
02:30:55,296 --> 02:30:58,083
rejoicing in this blessed day.

912
02:30:58,174 --> 02:31:01,291
Kind health descends on downy wings.

913
02:31:01,386 --> 02:31:03,718
Angels conduct her on the way.

914
02:31:03,805 --> 02:31:06,638
The New World‘s princess new life brings

915
02:31:06,724 --> 02:31:09,261
and swells our joys upon this day."

916
02:33:31,119 --> 02:33:32,609
Mother.

917
02:33:33,621 --> 02:33:35,282
Stay near me.

918
02:35:21,813 --> 02:35:23,644
Sweet Wife.

919
02:35:24,982 --> 02:35:26,973
Do you care for me still?

920
02:35:36,327 --> 02:35:39,069
I cannot be to you what I am not.

921
02:35:43,668 --> 02:35:47,832
She would never have married me
had she known that he were alive.

922
02:35:52,343 --> 02:35:54,834
She bound herself to me in ignorance,

923
02:35:54,929 --> 02:35:59,389
and I will not - I will not
let her be incumbered by a tie

924
02:35:59,475 --> 02:36:03,844
which she despises
or entered to in mischief.

925
02:36:06,816 --> 02:36:08,647
I Will do nothing against her will

926
02:36:46,814 --> 02:36:48,725
I think you still love the man

927
02:36:49,817 --> 02:36:52,729
and that you will not be at peace
until you see him.

928
02:36:55,448 --> 02:36:58,315
In my vanity, I thought...

929
02:37:00,077 --> 02:37:01,738
I could make you love me,

930
02:37:01,829 --> 02:37:05,492
and one cannot do that, or should not.

931
02:37:11,756 --> 02:37:15,590
You have walked... blindly

932
02:37:16,636 --> 02:37:19,093
into a situation
that you did not anticipate.

933
02:37:19,180 --> 02:37:23,389
I will not rob you of your self-respect.

934
02:37:34,570 --> 02:37:37,027
You are the man I thought you were...

935
02:37:39,367 --> 02:37:40,857
and more.

936
02:38:46,767 --> 02:38:49,258
Did I make a mistake in comin’ here?

937
02:38:51,605 --> 02:38:55,439
I would’ve come before,
except I‘ve been away from the capital.

938
02:39:00,448 --> 02:39:01,938
Perhaps...

939
02:39:02,950 --> 02:39:05,407
I’m out of order
speaking with you this way,

940
02:39:06,454 --> 02:39:08,615
but I’ve thought of you often.

941
02:39:13,669 --> 02:39:16,411
So after I left, it went well for you.

942
02:39:18,716 --> 02:39:20,627
I heard the king and queen received you.

943
02:39:20,718 --> 02:39:22,834
Everybody says you were a great favorite.

944
02:39:22,928 --> 02:39:25,544
They all speak of you.
One hears them in the streets.

945
02:39:25,639 --> 02:39:28,756
“Her Ladyship.”
Who’d have guessed it?

946
02:40:12,019 --> 02:40:17,013
You knew I had promised, didn‘t you?

947
02:40:17,108 --> 02:40:18,598
Yes.

948
02:40:29,203 --> 02:40:31,569
Did you find your Indies, John?

949
02:40:38,712 --> 02:40:40,373
You shall.

950
02:40:52,518 --> 02:40:54,679
I may have sailed past them.

951
02:41:15,040 --> 02:41:17,406
I thought it was a dream -

952
02:41:18,502 --> 02:41:20,493
what we knew in the forest.

953
02:41:23,507 --> 02:41:25,498
It’s the only truth.

954
02:41:33,142 --> 02:41:36,430
It seems as if I were speakin’ to you
for the first time.

955
02:43:18,205 --> 02:43:20,241
Can we not go home?

956
02:43:23,210 --> 02:43:25,041
As soon as possible.

957
02:43:42,563 --> 02:43:44,224
My husband.

958
02:44:43,791 --> 02:44:45,702
Listen.

959
02:45:11,652 --> 02:45:14,894
Thomas. Where?

960
02:45:33,006 --> 02:45:36,965
Mother, now I know where you live.

961
02:45:45,060 --> 02:45:48,052
Thirteenth of April, 1616.

962
02:45:48,147 --> 02:45:49,728
- Mother?
- Dear Son.

963
02:45:49,815 --> 02:45:50,770
Mother?

964
02:45:50,858 --> 02:45:52,814
I write this so that someday in the future

965
02:45:52,901 --> 02:45:57,565
you might understand a circumstance
which shall be but a far memory to you.

966
02:46:01,368 --> 02:46:04,075
Your dear mother, Rebecca, fell ill

967
02:46:04,163 --> 02:46:07,781
in our outward passage at Gravesend.

968
02:46:12,129 --> 02:46:15,121
She gently reminded me that all must die

969
02:46:15,215 --> 02:46:19,049
’Tis enough, she said,
that you, our child, should live.
