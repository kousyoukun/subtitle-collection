He wants to be paid.

Honey, when I spend
the night in a man's room,

15
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,184
he better pay me.

16

I want my money!

00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:35,276
What's he gonna do, kill us?

19
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:41,237
Here's Johan!

00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:49,120

00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,412
I want my money!

Give me the money!

Go outside!

24

Oops.

27
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:14,148
Hey!

28
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,517
Oh!

29
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,485
Oh, oui! Oh, hurry, mistress!

30
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:18,489
Get up!

31
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,235
Go on, go on!

32
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:25,111
I'm coming down for
you, eh? I want my money!

33
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,331
Ooh!

34
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:38,499
You getting tired, zou zou?

35
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,626
Whew. No, mistress.

36
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:41,968
Well, I am. Pull over.

37
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:53,139
Zou zou, I thought I told
you to pay that inn creep.

38
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,983
With what, mistress,
my good looks?

39
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,977
Well, you got a point there,
girlfriend.

40
00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:59,353
But, I mean, couldn't
you have done something

41
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,399
to pay for our room?

42
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,898
You know, wash dishes,
dug ditches?

43
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,445
Oui, mistress, you are right.

44
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:08,412
I mean, zou zou, you should
be grateful to do any labor,

45
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:11,407
no matter how menial,
because I can't.

46
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,083
I am a professional entertainer,

47
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,122
and I have to save every
ounce of my strength

48
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,133
for my audience.

49
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:29,015
Any more of
that blood sausage left?

50
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:37,812
Hm.

51
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:41,437
This sausage is good.
Too bad you're on a diet.

52
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:42,448
=I am?

53
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,565
Oh, but wait.

54
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,784
Oh!

55
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,720
Uh, did you call a cab?

56
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:15,770
Uh, hold on there, baldy.

57
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:19,858
Hold it just a minute.

58
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,147
I, I, I, uh...

59
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,280
You forgot my makeup case.

60
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,569
Oh.

61
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,741
Oh.

62
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:46,961
Hello. May I offer you
ladies a ride?

63
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:50,135
- Well-
- Oui, oui, we'd love a ride.

64
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:54,885
It, uh, depends.
Where ya headed, sailor?

65
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:57,137
I'm traveling north to
visit a client.

66
00:05:57,148 --> 00:06:01,061
Perhaps I could offer you and
your servant a nice lodging.

67
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,105
That is, of course, unless
you've made other arrangements.

68
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:04,478
Well.

69
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:07,196
Oh, sir, arrangements?
No, no, we do not have...

70
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,691
Oof!

71
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,160
Mm. Well, then, shall we go?

72
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:15,906
Please.

73
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:23,251
My name is Dr. Bradley.
Dr. Bradley Bradley.

74
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:24,623
Oh.

75
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:25,965
Your mother must have
thought you looked so nice,

76
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:28,836
she named you twice.

77
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,556
Eh.

78
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,676
Elvira's the name,
showbiz the game.

79
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,895
Ooh.

80
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,732
I'm just in the process of
fulfilling my lifelong dream

81
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:45,398
of opening in a
world-renowned Parisian revue.

82
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,690
It know.

83
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:47,938
You do?

84
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,315
But of course. Your
reputation precedes you.

85
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,868
Oh, damn, I hate when
that happens.

86
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:56,534
Uh, I don't owe you any money,
do I?

87
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,248
Good lord, no. I found your
play bill in the village.

88
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:04,413
Oh. Yes, of course.

89
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,415
And I must say, it's
quite a titillating image.

90
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:09,926
Yes, it is quite a
good likeness, isn't it?

91
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:13,515
Quite.

92
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,400
Oh!

93
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:33,237
So, what kind of
medicine man are you, man?

94
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,244
I am a psychiatrist.

95
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:38,450
Oh, great! 'Cause my
feet are killing me.

96
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:45,295
Charming.

97
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:49,624
Ooh.

98
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:53,595
I say. Perhaps we could arrange
for a private performance.

99
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:01,061
Lucky for you, I come
equipped with my own airbags.

100
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:02,064
I beg your pardon?

101
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:09,398
I'm so looking forward to
the next bump.

102
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,777
Uh, thanks for the lift, doc,

103
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:19,279
but, uh, I really gotta
get going, you know.

104
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,952
Nobody told me this was gonna
be Mr. toad's wild ride.

105
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:26,077
Oh, oh!

106
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,089
Oh, oh, oh!

107
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:33,009
Oh, my god!

108
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:39,474
Help! Oh, oh! Ooh, ah! Oh, ow,
ooh, ah!

109
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:49,901
Ow, ooh, ah!

110
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:55,239
I say, coachman, are you
making out all right up there?

111
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:58,454
Coachman!

112
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,188
Welcome to castle hellsubus.

113
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:35,155
Hm. Cheery.

114
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:08,806
Lady hellsubus. Allow
me to present elvira.

115
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,192
Charmed. I think.

116
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:16,029
Please, forgive me,
madam. It's just that you,

117
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:19,650
you, you...

118
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,652
Me, me, what?

119
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:23,789
You look pretty.

120
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:28,283
Please, come in.

121
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,466
= oof!

122
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:43,382
The lady and her servant
will be spending the night.

123
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:46,180
Very well. I'll have the
maid prepare the rooms.

124
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:52,353
I trust that your stay here
will be comfortable, madam.

125
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,226
Your cloak, ma'am.

126
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,284
Your gloves, ma'am.

127
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:14,333
Your shoes, ma'am.

128
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,921
Hold it right there.

129
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,961
I mean, I usually get paid
for this sort of thing.

130
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:19,505
You know, when I take a...
If you please, ma'am.

131
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,219
I am afraid it is imperative.

132
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:27,013
You see, my husband, he suffers
from an acute affliction

133
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,601
of the hearing.

134
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:33,019
Sounds that seem
commonplace to you orto I

135
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,984
cut into his head like knives!

136
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,572
Are you sure it's not just
some kind of kinky foot thing?

137
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:43,441
The shoes, if you please.

138
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:50,792
Ooh!

139
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:03,340
= oh!

140
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:04,554
Zou zou? = oh!

141
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,637
Would you help me?

142
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:10,931
= oh!

143
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:16,566
Lady hellsubus, would you
mind informing lord hellsubus

144
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,979
that he has a guest?

145
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,979
Something tells me he's
already figured that out.

146
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:58,858
Ooh, a piano bar!

147
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,451
Stop!

148
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:10,574
No more, please!

149
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,741
Jeez, everybody's a critic.

150
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:23,713
Elvira, allow me to present
lord viadimere hellsubus.

151
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,002
Enchante.

152
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:27,424
Ow! Oh!

153
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:28,842
Hey, we haven't even met yet!

154
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,762
Oh, sorry. Hey, nice jacket.

155
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,134
Who shot the stove?

156
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,733
Elvira is soon to be
one of gay paree's

157
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:41,772
foremost entertainers.

158
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:46,319
But the straight guys
like me, too.

159
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:49,985
Thank you, thank you,
but seriously, folks-

160
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,578
- no!

161
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,118
This cannot be. No!

162
00:13:58,546 --> 00:13:59,546
Nol!

163
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,332
Yeah. Nice meeting you, too.

164
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:06,884
Who's the old dude in the dress?

165
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:09,925
Perhaps he has seen your act.

166
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,022
Oui.

167
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:36,247
Oh!

168
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,040
Don't be frightened, elvira.

169
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:44,756
It's only the castle settling
down for the evening.

170
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,677
Come. It's time for bed.

171
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,680
= mm.

172
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:55,217
The village people
say this castle is evil.

173
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:58,015
Eh, who listens to the
village people anymore?

174
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,106
This castle and its
occupants are cursed.

175
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:07,479
It's the hellsubus family blood.

176
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:10,607
It causes them to do strange
and unnatural things.

177
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,280
= mm. Sounds like fun.

178
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:28,253
Lucian hellsubus. Vladimere's
great-great-grandfather.

179
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:29,967
Sadist, murderer.

180
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:32,383
Thousands of innocent souls
died by his torturous hands

181
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,301
in the dungeon of
this very castle.

182
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:36,800
Ew, nice hobby.

183
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:48,191
Captain teodore hellsubus.
Vladimere's grandfather.

184
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,188
Smuggler, slave trader,
pathological liar,

185
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,609
bad dancer, cross-dresser.

186
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,448
That's really weird.

187
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,444
Cross-dressers are
usually great dancers.

188
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:08,081
Oh!

189
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:11,300
Careful. The tremors seem to
have caused a bit of damage.

190
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:14,011
Yeah, duh. Anybody
ever heard of spackle?

191
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,597
And last but not least,
the lady donya hellsubus,

192
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:25,189
viadimere's mother.

193
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:29,857
Slut, harlot, seductress. Just
one man couldn't satisfy her.

194
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:30,944
I hear you, grandma.

195
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,816
Right. I'll show you to
your room, then.

196
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,718
This was her room.

197
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:54,881
Her? Her who?

198
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:57,676
Elura, vladimere's first wife.

199
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,844
Nobody has set foot in
it since her passing.

200
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:03,268
Whew, pee-yew.

201
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,763
Pass of what is the question.

202
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,561
Could you light a match
or something?

203
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,027
Elura died exactly
ten years ago tomorrow.

204
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:44,678
Dr. Bradley, I thought
ti heard a voice and I...

205
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:56,693
Oh, what's her problem?

206
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:58,778
Don't mind her.

207
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,822
She does this sort of
thing quite frequently.

208
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,037
She's not well, as you can see.

209
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:09,369
This pitiful creature
is roxana hellsubus,

210
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,621
lord hellsubus' niece.

211
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,964
She too is afflicted with
the hellsubus family curse,

212
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:17,506
which has ruined many a life,
including that of elura.

213
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,179
Beautiful, unfortunate elura.

214
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:23,803
I must say, the resemblance
between the two of you

215
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,426
is remarkable.

216
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:28,430
No wonder vladimere was so shocked
at the very sight of you.

217
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:31,436
Oh, my god!

218
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,309
Not only that, but
we're both wearing

219
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:35,778
the exact same nail Polish.

220
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:39,239
Really? How remarkable.

221
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,610
Well, it's getting kinda late,

222
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,533
and I'm off to Paris
in the morning.

223
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,780
Must you leave so soon?

224
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:50,451
Dr. Bradley, opening
my show in Paris

225
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:53,125
means more to me than
anything in the world,

226
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:56,794
even playing hide the
hot dog with you.

227
00:18:56,802 --> 00:19:01,592
Well, then.
What about a quick nightcap?

228
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:02,338
= no.

229
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,260
- Brandy?
- Mm-mm.

230
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,098
- Champagne? Palinka?
- Mm-mm.

231
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,512
Dubonnet with a twist?

232
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:11,059
- Oof!
- Ooh!

233
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:13,558
Mistress, it's time
for la douche.

234
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:16,523
Yes, quite right.

235
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:20,489
Well, I'll send my carriage
around in the morning.

236
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:21,493
Good night.

237
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,076
Oh, Dr. Bradley?

238
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,080
Yes?

239
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,579
Didn't you forget something?

240
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,495
Ah, yes. Quite right.

241
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:48,353
Good night.

242
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:53,525
Oh, and doc?

243
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,107
I'll take a rain check
on the physical.

244
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:05,829
Oh hi, ema.

245
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,079
Thanks for spying on us.

246
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,836
Oh, this is so relaxing.

247
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:26,009
Oh, zou zou, turn on
the bubbles, would you?

248
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,642
Ah. More hot water, zou zou.

249
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:40,148
But mistress, 1 will have to go

250
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:41,566
all the way down to the kitchen!

251
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,064
Yeah?

252
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,191
And I have to sit here in a
bathtub full of tepid water

253
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:47,238
until you get back.

254
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,702
Now scoot, scoot.

255
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:52,574
Oui. Sacrebleu.

256
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:05,886
Arr, ye dogs. We have
come for your Booty.

257
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,597
Oh, no, please, please,
Mr. big bad pirate,

258
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,717
please don't pillage my Booty!

259
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:17,390
Zou zou? Zou zou, is that you?

260
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,489
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

261
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:28,200
You wanna blow the rating
on this picture?

262
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,188
Hm. Finders keepers.

263
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:11,569
Where have I seen this
thing before?

264
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:17,454
Oh.

265
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,247
Come on, you're
dripping with jewels.

266
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:22,463
You're not gonna miss one
little old ring, are you?

267
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:27,836
Zou zou, you scared the
caca-doodie out of me!

268
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:29,303
Shh!

269
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:55,241
Haven't you
ever heard of knocking?

270
00:22:56,834 --> 00:23:00,042
I'm so sorry. I didn't
mean to startle you.

271
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:02,620
I'm lady roxana.

272
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,755
Oh, and I'm elvira.

273
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,967
Hey, what do you know?
The lady and the tramp!

274
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:24,400
I think this is a piece
of your lung. Ew.

275
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:26,897
Thank you.

276
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:31,741
I, I just came to apologize
for my ghastly behavior

277
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:33,536
earlier this evening.

278
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:38,409
I was just so shocked by
your appearance.

279
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,953
Yeah, well, most people are,

280
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,372
but they usually don't have
quite such a strong reaction.

281
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:48,841
For a moment, I thought
that you were my aunt elura,

282
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:51,714
risen from the grave!

283
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,840
Yeah, I seem to be
getting that a lot lately.

284
00:23:55,851 --> 00:24:00,185
So, roxana, is it true that
you also have the curse?

285
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:02,354
Yes, I'm afraid I do.

286
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:07,777
Really? And you still manage
to look so fresh all over.

287
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:11,523
Uncle vladimere says
there is no escape!

288
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:16,490
From the family curse.

289
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:18,570
Hey, cheer up.

290
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,038
I mean, maybe it's
like hair loss

291
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:21,782
and it'll skip a generation.

292
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:22,874
No!

293
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:26,245
Uncle vladimere says
I am destined

294
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:30,499
to remain within these
dark castle walls

295
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,381
for the rest of my short

296
00:24:34,515 --> 00:24:38,224
happy

297
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,601
life.

298
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:44,722
"Uncle viadimere
says, uncle vladimere says.”

299
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,519
You know, girl, I don't
wanna go sticking my nose

300
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:48,563
in where it don't belong,
but if I were you,

301
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,435
I would just pack my
little bags,

302
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:52,153
forget about what uncle
viadimere says,

303
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:54,523
and get the hell on out
of castle hellsubus.

304
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:57,902
Oh, if only I could.

305
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,575
Well, what's stopping
you? Your legs painted on?

306
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,664
Where will I go,
what would I do?

307
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:03,999
We leave for Paris
in the morning,

308
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:05,118
you could come with us, no?

309
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:07,911
Uh, no, actually,
where we're going

310
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:10,209
is kind of an
adults-only thing and-

311
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:14,301
- no, no.

312
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:15,635
Of, of course, I, I,

313
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:21,680
I understand.

314
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:24,554
All right, all right,
you can go with us.

315
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:26,055
Just be sure to have
your stuff ready tonight,

316
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:28,523
'cause we're leaving first
thing in the morning.

317
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,109
Oh, thank you, elvira,
you're wonderful!

318
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:34,407
Good night.

319
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:47,368
What do you want?

320
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:50,121
I just came to see
if you needed anything

321
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:52,214
before you retire.

322
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,048
A cup of warm milk, perhaps?

323
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,796
You know, actually, a cup of
warm milk sounds kinda good.

324
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,092
Thanks.

325
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,718
Very well. I'll have
the maid milk the goat.

326
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:05,435
Um, you know, on second thought,

327
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:07,896
just send up a bottle of
scotch and a straw, okay?

328
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:38,844
- Oh, what?
- Shh! Mistress, it's me!

329
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:41,384
Zou zou, what the hell
are you doing?

330
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:45,350
Listen! I'm scared!

331
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:49,597
Zou zou, that's just the grinding
and clanking noise that,

332
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,769
you know, instruments
of torture make.

333
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,112
All right, all right,

334
00:26:58,117 --> 00:26:59,448
I'll throw on something skimpy

335
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,487
and head down to the dungeon.

336
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:59,417
Let's see. Now where's
the secret door?

337
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:02,670
They always have one of those.

338
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:17,484
Oh!

339
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:45,973
Oh, hello.

340
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,877
Hmm, is somebody in there?
Hello?

341
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:08,170
Oh, roxana, is that you?

342
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:12,929
Oh, I just saw the light on
in here and I was wondering

343
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:14,346
what you were doing down here.

344
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:16,436
Um, you know, I wanted to
talk to you about...

345
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:21,775
Uh, careful, that thing
might go off in your hand.

346
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:25,153
Oh, you startled me.

347
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:28,566
If you're looking for
something to steal, uh,

348
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:29,737
there's really not much here.

349
00:30:29,745 --> 00:30:31,155
I already checked.

350
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:35,657
Oh, sorry. Lord hellsubus'
pistol needed cleaning.

351
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,874
Allow me to introduce myself,
madam.

352
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:43,672
How does he do that? Weird.

353
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,291
I am Adrian, the stable master.

354
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:50,004
I often come here secretly.

355
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:52,427
Books are my greatest
pleasure and as you can see,

356
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:54,390
the master has a
magnificent collection.

357
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,139
= of what?

358
00:30:57,147 --> 00:30:59,433
Hm. Books.

359
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:04,317
Oh, books. Yeah, I
hadn't noticed.

360
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:07,654
I'm constantly trying
to better myself.

361
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:08,567
It's working.

362
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:11,237
And who, may I ask, are you?

363
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:13,860
Oh, me? Oh, I'm just elvira.

364
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,828
You know, house guest,
bon vivant,

365
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:17,618
entertainer extraordinaire.

366
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:19,412
I'm just here for the night.

367
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:31,094
But then, a lot can happen
in a night.

368
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:35,473
Woo, lord have mercy.

369
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:36,842
It is warm in here, isn't it?

370
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:39,594
Your gown!

371
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:42,313
- Ow, ow, ow!
- Ah, ooh, ee, ah, ooh.

372
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:44,023
Ah.

373
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:46,814
Are you all right? Is
the fire out?

374
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:48,653
Honey, the fire's just
getting started.

375
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:51,398
I mean, it must have
been a cinder

376
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,196
that landed on my nightgown.

377
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:56,821
No, it was no accident.

378
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:59,699
This house is not a healthy
place for you to be.

379
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,574
Ew, not healthy?

380
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:04,168
I have been scratching
myself a lot lately.

381
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,662
And I'm sure lord hellsubus

382
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:08,461
has not been the most
gracious of hosts.

383
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:11,426
Duh, that's the understatement
of the 19th century.

384
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,920
Since the death of
his first wife,

385
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,796
he has not been feeling himself.

386
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:17,174
Too bad. It might relieve
a lot of that tension.

387
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:19,927
Ah, I'm afraid the poor
man is grief-stricken

388
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,725
ever since the lady
elura committed suicide.

389
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:24,688
Committed suicide?

390
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:26,558
Why would anybody living
here at sunnybrook farm

391
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:28,401
want to kill themselves?

392
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:31,112
The master blames
himself for her death.

393
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:35,155
Me, I blame the hellsubus curse.

394
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:36,868
Oh, you poor darling!

395
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:40,955
But I had nothing to do with it.

396
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:41,959
It don't care.

397
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:48,956
I mustn't be found here!

398
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,548
Get behind the curtain, quick!

399
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:52,008
Yeah, good idea.

400
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:02,894
I thought I heard voices.

401
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:05,514
Oh, yeah, you and everybody
else in this bug house.

402
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,620
A spider.

403
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:02,957
Hello?

404
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:05,991
Can anybody help me
with my bags?

405
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,129
Zou zou?

406
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:14,917
Zou zou! - I'm coming!

407
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:17,510
Zou zou, what do I pay you for?

408
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:19,880
But, mistress, you have
not paid me in months.

409
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:22,393
Oh, right.

410
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:35,698
Oh, ah!

411
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,411
I'm ready to go, elvira.

412
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:50,498
Elvira?

413
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,370
Mistress, do you need some help?

414
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:55,211
No. No, I don't need any help.

415
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:56,628
Do I look like I need help?

416
00:34:58,138 --> 00:34:59,628
Get rid of that damn cake.

417
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:04,094
Merci.

418
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:12,774
Where's that coach that
quack promised us?

419
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,142
I tried to tell you, mistress,

420
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:16,395
Dr. Bradley has the emergency!

421
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:19,273
Emergency? What about
my emergency?

422
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,275
He said something about
people in the village

423
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:24,027
dying of the plague.

424
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:25,950
Plague-shmague.

425
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:28,369
Ti have a show to do in Paris.

426
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:31,083
Oh, some people are so selfish.

427
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:33,005
Huh?

428
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,413
Oh, Adrian.

429
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:38,087
Hm. Uh, I've got an idea.

430
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:39,300
You two wait right here.

431
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:41,545
What? Mistress, where
are you going?

432
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:44,639
If I'm not back in an
hour, wait another hour.

433
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:49,018
Wha?

434
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:51,138
Oh.

435
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:59,821
Adrian! Adrian!

436
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:26,306
Ah!

437
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:49,832
Ah!

438
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,616
Oh, it's you.

439
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:56,040
Oh, you scared the
hell out of me.

440
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,912
Would that it was otherwise,
my dear.

441
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,545
They've struck again.

442
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:02,838
What, gophers?

443
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:06,304
No, grave robbers, in
a never-ending search

444
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:08,593
for the hellsubus family jewels.

445
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:12,640
Oh, for the love of god, why
can't they leave us alone?

446
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,057
Hasn't my family
suffered enough?

447
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:17,937
What manner of fiend is
it that would,

448
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:20,606
that would desecrate a
human grave in their hunger

449
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:22,524
for mere riches?

450
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:23,988
Oh, why, why, why?

451
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:27,282
Snap out of it!

452
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:28,948
God, what are you going for,
an Oscar?

453
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:29,990
Oh! My eyes, my eyes!

454
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,289
Would you mind, my dear?
They're over there.

455
00:37:36,463 --> 00:37:39,921
God. Here's your precious
horse blinders, you big baby.

456
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,460
You don't understand.

457
00:37:41,468 --> 00:37:45,507
My, my eyes are tortured by
all but the faintest of light.

458
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:48,630
Oh, so you've got a
hangover too, huh?

459
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:52,554
No, I suffer from acute
ocular sensitivity, my dear.

460
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:53,847
Oh. Too bad.

461
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:56,346
Um, listen, you know,
your friend Dr. Bradley

462
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:57,938
stood me up this morning,
so I was wondering

463
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:00,479
if Adrian the stable boy
could give me a ride.

464
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:04,230
Oh, frailty, thy name is woman.

465
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,440
Look, I just thought
you were Adrian,

466
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:09,238
that's why I was following you.

467
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:10,781
It know.

468
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:12,620
You do? Don't tell
me you're psychic, too.

469
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:16,958
No, I heard your footsteps.

470
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,748
Each and every one of them echo.

471
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:20,586
Echo?

472
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:23,171
Echo.

473
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:26,009
My hearing's hyper-sensitive,
too.

474
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:29,175
I hear everything, each
cry in the night,

475
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:33,471
the deafening whisper of
woodworm devouring the coffins,

476
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:37,721
the scratching of rats'
claws upon the stone, I,

477
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:38,767
ti hear it all.

478
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:42,563
What's that?

479
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:43,605
What?

480
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:45,695
There it is again!

481
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,484
Really? What does it sound like?

482
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:50,199
- Kinda like, ah-woo!
- Ah!

483
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:55,363
Oh, an animal, perhaps.

484
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:58,742
Wolves attracted by the
scent of rotting flesh.

485
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:00,792
Uh, wolves?

486
00:39:00,797 --> 00:39:02,913
Maybe we should head
back to the...

487
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,460
My beloved wife's grave.

488
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:22,478
She passed away 10 years
ago this, this very day.

489
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:31,240
Oh, elura. So beautiful,
so young, so full of life.

490
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:38,448
But as I carried her over the
threshold of castle hellsubus

491
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:43,123
on our wedding day, a
strange darkness befell her.

492
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,966
Soon after, she took to her bed.

493
00:39:56,978 --> 00:39:59,560
She would neither eat nor sleep.

494
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:01,896
I tried everything to
cheer her up.

495
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:30,258
Each night, elura took

496
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:33,503
to wandering the halls
of castle hellsubus,

497
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:37,348
listening to the accursed
voices of the demented souls

498
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:40,640
emanating from within
its blood-soaked walls.

499
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,064
I prayed that I might rescue her

500
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:51,484
from this infernal nightmare,

501
00:40:51,491 --> 00:40:55,575
but aided by the corrupting
powers of diabolical cunning,

502
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:56,693
she eluded me.

503
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:04,580
And then one night,
those demonic deceivers

504
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:07,203
of suicidal destruction

505
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:10,207
imposed their poisonous
and cankerous will

506
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:14,632
upon this sweet, unblemished
child of innocence and grace

507
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:20,434
and ordered her to climb
to the top of the tower.

508
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,188
And then, to jump.

509
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:49,413
We were married for
just one year.

510
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:51,873
Well, you know what they say.

511
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:53,966
I mean, 50% of all
marriages end in divorce,

512
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:56,256
so it wouldn't have worked
out anyway, probably.

513
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:01,518
Are you okay?

514
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:04,229
It's you, you! You!

515
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:09,148
Me, me, me, what?

516
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:10,938
Elura, elura, elura!

517
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:16,523
No, elvira, elvira, elvira.

518
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:19,901
I'll send you back to hell!

519
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:24,872
Ah! Ah, ooh, ooh! Oh.

520
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:28,998
Ooh, that smarts. What happened?

521
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:31,462
Uh, you don't remember?

522
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:33,957
No, I must have undergone
some kind of blackout.

523
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,297
Yeah, yeah. Uh, you tripped.

524
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:43,099
You know, I'm a little sheepish
when it comes to wolves.

525
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:45,639
Uh, what do you say we head
on back to the castle, okay?

526
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:50,606
Oh, yes, good idea.

527
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:02,155
Oh! Oh, thank you, my dear.

528
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:09,042
I think I might just go
upstairs and rest for awhile.

529
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,540
Okay, you do that.

530
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:13,913
And uh, while you're at it,

531
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:16,007
you might want to
grab an icepack.

532
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,010
Yes,

533
00:43:32,652 --> 00:43:34,734
Ah-ah-ah! Hold it right there.

534
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:38,062
Mutton stew.

535
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:42,737
Mm, mm. Whoa, dude.

536
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:45,236
Somebody went a little
heavy on the tabasco.

537
00:43:45,248 --> 00:43:48,035
This is my husband's
chamber pot, madam.

538
00:44:21,284 --> 00:44:25,618
Disturbing, yes, but perfectly
harmless, I assure you.

539
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:29,326
Oh, yeah, no problemo.
I'm from California.

540
00:44:31,961 --> 00:44:35,044
So, as I was saying,
I was in the village

541
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:36,878
cleaning out the pussy,
runny sores

542
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:38,874
of this poor old woman
and I said to her,

543
00:44:38,885 --> 00:44:40,671
"madam, I believe you
have the plague.”

544
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,964
And she said, "oh, no, sir,
I don't have the plague.”

545
00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:46,430
And just at that moment, her
ear dropped off.

546
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:51,019
Roll? I can assure you, ema,
it was rousing good fun.

547
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:54,139
Bradley, you always have

548
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:56,391
the most amusing stories.

549
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:04,315
Mm, gee. This looks delicious.

550
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:06,453
It's gruel.

551
00:45:07,288 --> 00:45:09,529
Yeah, damn straight it's cruel.

552
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,952
I mean, I was really hungry.

553
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:14,541
No, madam, it's hot gruel.

554
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:18,788
That's something to say.
It's fine.

555
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:24,969
I'm afraid those of the
hellsubus clan

556
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:28,385
can consume only the
most pallid mash,

557
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:31,304
wear only the softest
of clothing,

558
00:45:31,312 --> 00:45:34,099
tolerate only the
faintest of light.

559
00:45:35,191 --> 00:45:36,191
You see,

560
00:45:43,658 --> 00:45:45,614
My husband and roxana

561
00:45:45,618 --> 00:45:49,861
suffer from certain
peculiarities of temperament.

562
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:54,198
Yeah, where I come from,
they call it hypochondria.

563
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:55,871
Pardon?

564
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:59,791
I said, uh, maybe it's
just all in their mind.

565
00:45:59,799 --> 00:46:01,164
Precisely.

566
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:03,917
And when something is in
someone's mind,

567
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:07,261
it is more real, more powerful

568
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:10,177
than any mere physical malady.

569
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:11,390
Yeah, right.

570
00:46:11,394 --> 00:46:13,225
Like there's something
going on in my mind.

571
00:46:13,229 --> 00:46:15,311
Well now, shall we see?

572
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:16,975
What do you know about hypnosis?

573
00:46:16,983 --> 00:46:18,439
It's a bunch of hooey.

574
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:20,273
I once did a show with
Ivan the incredible.

575
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:23,520
He tried to hypnotize me
and make me bark like a dog.

576
00:46:23,531 --> 00:46:25,146
And did it work?

577
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:27,148
Well, by the time he was done,

578
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:29,241
he was the one who was
sitting up and begging.

579
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:32,330
Girlfriend.

580
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:35,289
Hm.

581
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:36,578
I assure you, elvira,

582
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:39,497
the powers of hypnotism
are very real.

583
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:41,291
Allow me to demonstrate.

584
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:48,885
Look deeply into my eyes.

585
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:52,385
Trust me, I'm a doctor.

586
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:53,883
Wish I had a peso

587
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:55,475
for every time I heard
that old line.

588
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,970
Give your will over to mine.

589
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:11,738
- Whew.
- Your hands

590
00:47:11,746 --> 00:47:13,611
are melting into mine.

591
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:17,240
Soon, very soon, they
will become one with mine.

592
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:19,958
Yeah, well, just watch
the nails, will you?

593
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:21,498
Close your eyes.

594
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:23,962
You will try, you will try,
but you will not be able.

595
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:25,581
You will try very soon,
you will try now,

596
00:47:25,593 --> 00:47:27,549
but you will not, you
cannot move them!

597
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:29,878
Will you please hold it down?

598
00:47:29,889 --> 00:47:31,379
I'm just trying to sleep here.

599
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:36,133
Is she hypnotized?

600
00:47:36,145 --> 00:47:40,013
No, I am not hypnot...

601
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:44,484
Elvira. You're a little
girl, very happy, so young,

602
00:47:45,446 --> 00:47:48,904
so happy. So very, very happy.

603
00:47:52,745 --> 00:47:55,236
It's all brightness
and butterflies.

604
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:56,908
They're a wonder to behold.

605
00:47:56,916 --> 00:47:57,951
See them.

606
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:59,869
See them?

607
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:03,290
I just love
butterflies ever so much.

608
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:06,004
Why look, there's
one on a flower.

609
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:08,670
Reach out, elvira, you
can almost touch it.

610
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:10,213
Reach out. Oh, it's a bee,
it stung you!

611
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:14,681
- Ow, ow! Ow!
- No, no, no tears, elvira.

612
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:16,514
There's no reason to weep.

613
00:48:28,364 --> 00:48:33,074
Don't weep for me. Weep
for viadimere.

614
00:48:34,203 --> 00:48:36,990
I have come to wreak
my vengeance.

615
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:47,163
Wow, who turned out the lights?

616
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:49,836
See, I told you that hypnotism
thing was a bunch of hooey.

617
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:51,886
Ow. Mm.

618
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:58,136
I'm, I'm afraid I'm
feeling a bit unstable.

619
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:04,188
Speaking of unstab-le, stable.
Where's lord loco anyway?

620
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:23,449
So plague or no plague,

621
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:24,917
your coach is picking
me up tomorrow, right?

622
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,285
Oh, absolutely.

623
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:27,787
I assure you, elvira,

624
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:30,756
you won't be spending another
night in castle hellsubus.

625
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:42,343
Happy anniversary, elura.

626
00:49:44,607 --> 00:49:47,189
You know, poor guy's
had a tough day.

627
00:49:47,193 --> 00:49:49,400
Yes, poor vliadimere.

628
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:51,985
I don't believe I've ever
seen him looking so morose.

629
00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:56,316
Well, I mean, who wouldn't
be with this dirge playing?

630
00:50:03,042 --> 00:50:04,042
Move over, honey.

631
00:50:05,211 --> 00:50:08,669
Let's see if we can't turn
that frown upside down.

632

Viadimere.

663
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:08,974
Who, who is it? Who's there?

664
00:53:13,232 --> 00:53:14,847
Viadimere!

665
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:23,991
Viadimere.

666
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:40,004
Vladimere, what is it?

667
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:43,171
I, I, I saw her. It was her.

668
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:46,341
Who, man? Whom did you see?

669
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:48,964
I, I saw, I saw

670
00:53:50,686 --> 00:53:51,801
no one.

671
00:53:51,812 --> 00:53:54,849
Nothing, I, I must have
been dreaming.

672
00:53:58,152 --> 00:54:01,315
Oh.

673
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:09,697
All of you! All of you!
All of you die!

674
00:54:09,705 --> 00:54:13,698
Oh.

675
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:17,670
What?

676
00:54:18,714 --> 00:54:19,714
What?

677
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:23,256
What, what happened?

678
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:25,296
Uh, you, uh, tripped again.

679
00:54:27,139 --> 00:54:29,175
You gotta lay off of
that absinthe.

680
00:54:29,183 --> 00:54:30,468
Thank you.

681
00:54:30,476 --> 00:54:33,593
That ring!

682
00:54:33,604 --> 00:54:35,936
Where did you get that ring?

683
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:37,645
Uh, this old thing?

684
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:39,935
Uh, I just found it in my room.

685
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:42,685
It was elura"s! Her
wedding ring.

686
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:44,402
You took it!

687
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:46,772
Sheesh, calm down, will you?

688
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:49,491
Here, you can have it. It's
too tacky for me, anyway.

689
00:54:49,495 --> 00:54:51,531
No, no. No, get it away,
get it away!

690
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:53,620
Will you make up your mind?

691
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:57,583
Elura was wearing that
ring when I buried her.

692
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:02,250
Ew.

693
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:11,088
Don't even think about it.

694
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:13,465
Then it's true! It is true!

695
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:15,728
She's alive!

696
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:20,848
Vladimere, you know very
well that's not possible.

697
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:26,020
Well, there's only one
way to find out.

698
00:55:33,205 --> 00:55:36,163
Oh, here, let me help
you with that.

699
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,656
- Mm.
- There.

700
00:55:37,668 --> 00:55:40,034
All spic and span. I'll
get the rest later.

701
00:55:57,771 --> 00:56:00,558
Almost got it.

702
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:11,903
Oh, my god! It's true!

703
00:56:13,579 --> 00:56:14,579
She is alive!

704
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:21,621
Girl, you are starting
to get on my last nerve.

705
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:36,927
Good lord. No heartbeat.

706
00:56:38,854 --> 00:56:39,854
Mirror?

707
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:46,441
No breath, either!

708
00:56:47,988 --> 00:56:50,570
I'm afraid she's quite dead.

709
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:56,781
Well, at least we'll get
some use out of that coffin.

710
00:57:05,297 --> 00:57:08,755
Poor roxana. She's
found peace at last.

711
00:57:08,759 --> 00:57:12,297
For a member of the
hellsubus line,

712
00:57:12,304 --> 00:57:15,262
even death can bring no peace.

713
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:19,554
Oh! If only it were me
instead of her.

714
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:23,474
Yes, if only it was you.

715
00:57:23,482 --> 00:57:27,725
Yes, if only it was.

716
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:32,397
Yes, if only.

717
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:56,632
Must you close the
casket so soon, vladimere?

718
00:57:58,141 --> 00:58:00,302
Yeah, boy, you guys don't
waste any time, do you?

719
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,750
I mean, the body's not
even cold yet.

720
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:08,106
It's time for roxana to join
the rest of the hellsubus clan.

721
00:58:12,072 --> 00:58:15,360
Why, why, why? She was
so young and so

722
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,025
young!

723
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:21,494
Roxana! We hardly knew ye!

724
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:25,036
She was a good girl.
She never hoit nobody!

725
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:28,251
You're with the angels now,
darling.

726
00:58:28,255 --> 00:58:29,711
Oh!

727
00:58:29,715 --> 00:58:31,797
Oh, man, I don't know
about the rest of you guys,

728
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:35,042
but I need a drink.

729
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:07,933
Hello? Adrian?

730
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:29,956
Mm-mm.

731
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:37,463
Ah, Adrian.

732
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:40,425
That's quite a big hammer
you're swinging there.

733
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:41,793
Elvira.

734
01:00:41,805 --> 01:00:45,013
I was just shoeing a horse
for your trip tomorrow.

735
01:00:45,016 --> 01:00:48,304
Yeah, well, I thought I'd just
bring you a little something

736
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:49,346
to remember me by.

737
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:51,313
A book!

738
01:00:53,692 --> 01:00:57,059
Elvira, you are as generous
as you are beautiful.

739
01:00:58,822 --> 01:01:00,858
Ah, "Kama Sutra."

740
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:04,782
Yeah. Have you read it already?

741
01:01:04,786 --> 01:01:06,401
= I'm afraid I haven't.

742
01:01:06,413 --> 01:01:08,404
Oh, too bad.

743
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:10,622
I hope there aren't too
many big words.

744
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:12,240
Yeah, well, don't
worry about it.

745
01:01:12,252 --> 01:01:14,243
I mean, it's mostly pictures.

746
01:01:14,254 --> 01:01:16,586
Here, let me show you the
first chapter.

747
01:01:22,721 --> 01:01:24,257
= I'm not sure I follow.

748
01:01:24,264 --> 01:01:26,004
Oh, read on.

749
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:56,084
Mm. Nicholai.

750
01:01:57,339 --> 01:02:00,046
Elura. At long last.

751
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:07,429
My brother would have my
head if he knew about us.

752
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:10,720
Viadimere will never find out.

753
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:32,412
No!

754
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,115
Help me! Help me!

755
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:38,170
Help!

756
01:02:39,297 --> 01:02:40,297
No, please!

757
01:02:43,635 --> 01:02:44,635
Nol!

758
01:02:46,346 --> 01:02:47,346
Help me!

759
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:53,558
No, help me, elvira!

760
01:04:59,187 --> 01:05:00,267
Who's there?

761
01:05:06,236 --> 01:05:08,397
Zou zou, is that you?

762
01:05:08,405 --> 01:05:10,691
What do you think you
are, a freaking parakeet?

763
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:29,043
Oh, you will not believe
this weird dream I had.

764
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:31,462
I think that elura's buried
alive down here somewhere

765
01:05:31,469 --> 01:05:33,005
and I think that I know who...

766
01:05:35,807 --> 01:05:37,843
How did you two get down here?

767
01:05:37,851 --> 01:05:40,263
This dungeon has been
locked for 100 years.

768
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:41,680
Yeah, right,

769
01:05:41,688 --> 01:05:43,974
and, uh, I suppose you've
never been down here either.

770
01:05:43,982 --> 01:05:47,099
Madam, I swear to you, I've
never before set foot in,

771
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:48,566
in this place.

772
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:53,155
Uh, look, little lord
paranoid, I didn't say you did.

773
01:05:53,158 --> 01:05:55,865
I just said that if you are
the only person with the key-

774
01:05:55,869 --> 01:05:59,782
- it was in this foul dungeon
that my great-grandfather,

775
01:05:59,789 --> 01:06:01,745
lord Lucian hellsubus,

776
01:06:01,749 --> 01:06:06,083
committed unspeakable
acts of torture.

777
01:06:06,087 --> 01:06:08,419
Ooh, like, "whip me, baby,
whip me"?

778
01:06:08,423 --> 01:06:11,210
In a nutshell, yes.

779
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:15,460
Ouch.

780
01:06:15,472 --> 01:06:18,384
Oh, my god!

781
01:06:20,518 --> 01:06:22,099
This is it! It's this walll

782
01:06:23,229 --> 01:06:24,969
it's, it's the wall
from my dream!

783
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:26,312
What?

784
01:06:26,316 --> 01:06:30,184
What on earth are you
talking about, my dear?

785
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:44,197
It wasn't a dream. It
really happened!

786
01:06:45,502 --> 01:06:48,414
Elura didn't kill herself.
You killed her!

787
01:06:49,756 --> 01:06:53,294
I had to do it, elura.
Don't you see?

788
01:06:54,802 --> 01:06:59,592
You were going to leave
me. Leave this castle.

789
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:02,591
No one in the hellsubus
clan can ever leave,

790
01:07:02,602 --> 01:07:04,263
as I told dear roxana.

791
01:07:05,813 --> 01:07:07,974
You mean roxana was...

792
01:07:07,982 --> 01:07:10,974
Yes, about to be buried alive,
too.

793
01:07:10,985 --> 01:07:14,148
That's another unfortunate
hellsubus family trait.

794
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:16,281
Catalepsy.

795
01:07:17,825 --> 01:07:19,816
Fear of cats?

796
01:07:19,827 --> 01:07:22,489
It's a condition which
completely parallels

797
01:07:22,497 --> 01:07:23,497
the look of death.

798
01:07:24,958 --> 01:07:29,327
Ah. You mean, then, she was...

799
01:07:29,337 --> 01:07:31,123
And, and you knew?

800
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:32,870
- Yes.
- And...

801
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:34,088
Yes, I'm afraid.

802
01:07:34,092 --> 01:07:36,629
I'm afraid burying people alive

803
01:07:36,636 --> 01:07:40,470
is another unfortunate
hellsubus family trait.

804
01:07:40,473 --> 01:07:42,714
- Huh?
- And now, elvira,

805
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:46,343
it's time to send you
back from whence you came.

806
01:07:46,354 --> 01:07:47,343
To hell!

807
01:07:47,355 --> 01:07:52,315
No!

808
01:07:56,864 --> 01:07:58,525
Ah!

809
01:07:58,533 --> 01:08:01,320
I shall rip your black heart out

810
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:04,034
and feed it to the
carrion crows!

811
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:20,217
Sheesh, you'd think he
would have learned by now.

812
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:32,563
Ah, there he is.
Pretty as a picture.

813
01:08:35,987 --> 01:08:39,479
It is rather amusing, isn't it,
dearest?

814
01:08:39,490 --> 01:08:43,278
Your first wife, elura,
an adulteress.

815
01:08:44,662 --> 01:08:47,244
Your brother nicholai,
an adulterer.

816
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:51,328
Your second wife, an adulteress.

817
01:08:52,754 --> 01:08:56,667
Your trusted doctor and
friend, an adulterer!

818
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:33,040
Oy, mate!

819
01:09:33,044 --> 01:09:36,957
No, he's
completely off it this time.

820
01:09:36,964 --> 01:09:41,082
We've done it. Look
at the pathetic milksop.

821
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:44,051
He'd be better off dead.

822
01:09:44,055 --> 01:09:46,046
Yeah, but we wouldn't,
would we, love?

823
01:09:46,057 --> 01:09:47,672
And now that he's off his nut,

824
01:09:47,684 --> 01:09:49,424
you and I are
completely in control

825
01:09:49,435 --> 01:09:51,596
of the hellsubus family fortune.

826
01:09:51,604 --> 01:09:55,017
And no one will question
his need for constant care

827
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:58,391
from his trusted doctor,

828
01:09:58,403 --> 01:10:03,238
with the help of his
faithful wife, of course.

829
01:10:03,241 --> 01:10:06,199
I hope you've
learned your lesson about this.

830
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:09,786
Never sign a
prenuptial agreement!

831
01:10:15,169 --> 01:10:16,750
Elvira.

832
01:10:16,754 --> 01:10:17,994
Oh.

833
01:10:18,005 --> 01:10:19,666
How nice of you to join us.

834
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:22,248
Hi there.

835
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:24,421
Um, I was just leaving, so
I'll see you guys around!

836
01:10:24,429 --> 01:10:26,886
Ah. No, you don't, love.

837
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:30,006
Oh, no. Don't leave, elvira.

838
01:10:30,977 --> 01:10:33,013
The fun is just beginning.

839
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:40,642
Whoa.

840
01:10:52,623 --> 01:10:57,492
Yoo-hoo, elvira! Your
carriage awaits!

841
01:10:57,503 --> 01:10:58,503
Elvira!

842
01:11:00,757 --> 01:11:02,748
Hmm, maybe she's upstairs.

843
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:12,844
God, it's great, isn't it?
Look at the size of that rack.

844
01:11:13,978 --> 01:11:16,014
Elvira, I must confess,

845
01:11:16,022 --> 01:11:18,684
I find the sight of you in
pain particularly arousing.

846
01:11:19,692 --> 01:11:20,807
Ow!

847
01:11:20,818 --> 01:11:23,480
Careful, Bradley, or
you'll be next.

848
01:11:23,488 --> 01:11:27,197
I swear, you guys, 1
didn't hear a thing. Ow!

849
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:29,942
About you and the doctor
having an affair.

850
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:31,362
Oh!

851
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:33,782
And, and, and of you trying
to make viadimere insane

852
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:36,702
so that you could steal
the family jewels.

853
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:37,709
Ow, ow!

854
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:41,035
Nicholai!

855
01:11:41,047 --> 01:11:42,912
Oh, vladimere.

856
01:11:42,924 --> 01:11:46,337
How are you? I must
confess you look better.

857
01:11:46,344 --> 01:11:48,676
Thank you, dear
brother. That's very kind.

858
01:11:48,679 --> 01:11:50,044
It think that...

859
01:11:50,056 --> 01:11:52,547
Brother? Vladimere, whatever
on earth do you mean?

860
01:11:52,558 --> 01:11:54,549
It was always you, nicholai!

861
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,346
A - no! Iways you!

862
01:11:56,354 --> 01:11:58,515
- No.
- First you stole my toys.

863
01:11:58,523 --> 01:12:00,184
- No!
- Then our dear mother's

864
01:12:00,191 --> 01:12:04,901
sweet love, and then
finally, my beloved elura.

865
01:12:04,904 --> 01:12:07,941
You must die, nicholai!
You must diel

866
01:12:07,949 --> 01:12:11,988
vladimere, no!

867
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:15,987
As for you, you too will suffer

868
01:12:15,998 --> 01:12:17,408
for your faithlessness, elura.

869
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:22,668
But, husband, I'm not elura,
I'm emal

870
01:12:22,672 --> 01:12:24,833
before this day is out,

871
01:12:24,841 --> 01:12:29,301
you will beg me to release
you from the unimaginable hell

872
01:12:29,303 --> 01:12:32,591
into which you're about
to be plunged.

873
01:12:36,102 --> 01:12:38,093
Die, die in agony, elura!

874
01:12:44,068 --> 01:12:46,024
= I'm not elura! She is!

875
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:55,823
Oh, that
ema! She's such a kidder.

876
01:12:58,499 --> 01:13:03,118
Oh, forgive me. My
slutty adulteress, darling.

877
01:13:04,088 --> 01:13:06,454
Hey, don't call me darling.

878
01:13:06,465 --> 01:13:09,081
Let me release you
from your bondage.

879
01:13:09,093 --> 01:13:10,458
Uh, yeah, that'd be great,

880
01:13:10,469 --> 01:13:13,586
because I'm really not into
this kinda thing anyway.

881
01:13:13,598 --> 01:13:15,054
Oh no, no, no, no, no!

882
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:18,720
No, the other way, the
other way, the other way!

883
01:13:18,728 --> 01:13:22,312
Woops.

884
01:13:22,315 --> 01:13:26,479
Please forgive me, my dear,
but old habits die hard.

885
01:13:27,445 --> 01:13:32,360
Yeah. Ah.

886
01:13:37,663 --> 01:13:42,248
Wow.

887
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:46,915
Ah. Hm.

888
01:13:49,133 --> 01:13:50,133
Elvira?

889
01:13:54,555 --> 01:13:57,513
Elvira? It's your stable stud.

890
01:13:57,516 --> 01:13:59,302
Time to go to the train sta...

891
01:14:10,655 --> 01:14:11,940
Help!

892
01:14:19,246 --> 01:14:20,361
Help me! = huh?

893
01:14:23,834 --> 01:14:28,794
Help me!

894
01:14:37,223 --> 01:14:39,214
Do you know where you are,
elura?

895
01:14:39,225 --> 01:14:41,967
Shall I tell you where you are,
elura?

896
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:45,136
Would you stop with
the elura stuff?

897
01:14:45,147 --> 01:14:49,356
Elura is dead. I'm elvira,
remember?

898
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:51,851
J life is like a music hall,
yeah j

899
01:14:51,862 --> 01:14:55,605
oh, prepare to enter hell,
elura, the netherworld,

900
01:14:55,616 --> 01:14:59,700
the abode of the dead,
the infernal regions.

901
01:14:59,704 --> 01:15:03,242
That place of torment,
pandemonium, abandonment,

902
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:09,414
that vast unbottomed place
that's really, really hot.

903
01:15:13,259 --> 01:15:14,259
Araka.

904
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:18,346
Gehenna.

905
01:15:20,266 --> 01:15:21,266
Hades.

906
01:15:22,852 --> 01:15:24,092
The boundless-

907
01:15:24,103 --> 01:15:26,765
- all right, all right,
I gotit, I got it.

908
01:15:26,772 --> 01:15:29,684
Jeez, will somebody
take away his thesaurus?

909
01:15:29,692 --> 01:15:32,729
Don't interrupt when
I'm on a roll, elura.

910
01:15:34,488 --> 01:15:36,444
Elvira! Where are you?

911
01:15:37,491 --> 01:15:38,697
Adrian, help!

912
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:44,866
I'm in here, in the dungeon!

913
01:15:47,585 --> 01:15:51,043
In this place, no one can
hear you scream.

914
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:57,379
No! Adrian, help!

915
01:15:57,386 --> 01:15:58,386
Elvira!

916
01:15:59,263 --> 01:16:00,263
- Adrian!
- Elviral

917
01:16:01,682 --> 01:16:06,142
now let me present for
your final enjoyment, the pit

918
01:16:07,354 --> 01:16:08,560
and the pendulum!

919
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:18,396
Oh, oh, my god. Oh, my god.

920
01:16:18,407 --> 01:16:21,649
Adrian, Adrian, hurry! Adrian!

921
01:16:25,206 --> 01:16:30,166
Ah!

922
01:16:43,641 --> 01:16:44,641
Adrian!

923
01:16:46,644 --> 01:16:48,600
Where are you?

924
01:16:48,604 --> 01:16:49,604
Elvira!

925
01:17:02,243 --> 01:17:06,202
Adrian, I
haven't got all day here!

926
01:17:06,205 --> 01:17:08,821
Who is that laughing?

927
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:13,121
Who is that laughing?

928
01:17:13,129 --> 01:17:15,165
Hurry! Really, hurry up!

929
01:17:15,172 --> 01:17:16,457
I'm not kidding!

930
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:27,640
Adrian! Oh!

931
01:17:34,984 --> 01:17:36,190
Help, help! Oh!

932
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:39,856
Hold on!

933
01:17:39,864 --> 01:17:44,654
I can't! I have
to do everything myself?

934
01:18:09,018 --> 01:18:12,306
You can never escape me, elura.

935
01:18:16,108 --> 01:18:19,896
No, it is you who will
never escape me, vladimere!

936
01:18:39,673 --> 01:18:44,633
My eyes! My eyes!

937
01:18:57,024 --> 01:18:59,606
Whoa, talk about your
dysfunctional families.

938
01:18:59,610 --> 01:19:02,101
Oh!

939
01:19:14,708 --> 01:19:16,244
My eyes, my eyes!

940
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:20,880
Help, elura!

941
01:19:27,471 --> 01:19:28,471
Elvira!

942
01:19:29,473 --> 01:19:32,636
Adrian! You came too late!

943
01:19:33,727 --> 01:19:34,727
Again.

944
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:43,442
Don't worry! We're safe now.

945
01:20:02,131 --> 01:20:03,621
Oh, yeah, almost forgot.

946
01:20:03,632 --> 01:20:05,338
It's your maid, zou zou.

947
01:20:08,304 --> 01:20:09,304
What to do?

948
01:20:11,348 --> 01:20:12,463
Here!

949
01:20:12,474 --> 01:20:13,509
Okay, keep your shirt on.

950
01:20:13,517 --> 01:20:15,553
We've got everything
under con...

951
01:20:19,106 --> 01:20:20,106
Oh.

952
01:20:20,816 --> 01:20:22,226
Here, give me your hand!

953
01:20:24,445 --> 01:20:27,437
That's it.

954
01:20:27,448 --> 01:20:29,154
- Come!
- Come on, come on, hurry!

955
01:20:29,158 --> 01:20:30,773
Move it!

956
01:20:33,162 --> 01:20:35,528
Wait! Wait for me, mistress!

957
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:49,709
- Okay!
- Come! Hurry!

958
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:54,680
Oh, god.
This place is coming down!

959
01:20:55,976 --> 01:20:58,809
Bradley? Where are you going?

960
01:20:58,812 --> 01:21:00,052
Oh!

961
01:21:00,064 --> 01:21:01,064
Save Mel

962
01:21:01,899 --> 01:21:05,517
ema, there's no time! It's
you or the family jewels!

963
01:21:05,527 --> 01:21:09,736
If I ever get out of
here, I'm going to kill you!

964
01:21:11,033 --> 01:21:14,946
Right, it's the jewels then.

965
01:21:14,953 --> 01:21:17,410
Damn you, Bradley! Damn you!

966
01:21:22,628 --> 01:21:25,870
Wait, wait!

967
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:30,841
Oh, great.

968
01:22:04,336 --> 01:22:05,336
Save me!

969
01:22:11,969 --> 01:22:14,176
My god, it's ema!

970
01:22:14,179 --> 01:22:16,886
She's still alive. I
must go back.

971
01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:19,973
No, no, you can't go back
in there. What are you, nuts?

972
01:22:19,977 --> 01:22:22,013
You don't understand, elvira.

973
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:23,885
I'm ema's illegitimate
half-brother.

974
01:22:25,149 --> 01:22:26,434
No!

975
01:22:26,442 --> 01:22:27,522
Bye!

976
01:22:28,527 --> 01:22:33,692
Come back, you crazy bastard!

977
01:22:42,749 --> 01:22:47,709
Mind the gap!

978
01:22:49,923 --> 01:22:51,629
My jewels! My jewels!

979
01:22:55,304 --> 01:22:56,304
Ema!

980
01:22:59,349 --> 01:23:00,384
Ooh, ow! Ooh!

981
01:23:38,555 --> 01:23:40,170
Thank you, elvira.

982
01:23:46,271 --> 01:23:49,934
Oh, my god! That's,
that's incredible!

983
01:23:49,942 --> 01:23:51,148
What, mistress?

984
01:23:51,151 --> 01:23:52,911
That the spirit of elura
is finally set free?

985
01:23:54,321 --> 01:23:57,859
No, that, that we can afford
such a groovy special effect!

986
01:23:57,866 --> 01:24:02,826
Oh, oui!

987
01:24:15,425 --> 01:24:18,588
Remind me never to hitch a
ride in a strange coach again.

988
01:24:43,870 --> 01:24:45,986
Yoo-hoo!

989
01:24:53,839 --> 01:24:57,047
Ladies, may 1 offer you a ride?

990
01:24:57,050 --> 01:24:59,336
Whoa, it's like deja vu
all over again!

991
01:25:02,806 --> 01:25:04,262
So anyway, we're lucky
we even got out of there

992
01:25:04,266 --> 01:25:05,381
with our lives.

993
01:25:05,392 --> 01:25:06,677
Oui, oui, if it was
not for elvira,

994
01:25:06,685 --> 01:25:09,427
I would be squished like
a French grape.

995
01:25:09,438 --> 01:25:11,895
Where did you say
this castle was?

996
01:25:11,898 --> 01:25:14,059
Just there in the
carpathian mountains.

997
01:25:14,067 --> 01:25:16,558
Yeah, castle hellsubus,
you ever heard of it?

998
01:25:19,531 --> 01:25:22,989
You could not possibly
have visited there.

999
01:25:22,993 --> 01:25:24,574
Hello, I think I know
where I just spent

1000
01:25:24,578 --> 01:25:26,569
the worst weekend of
my whole life.

1001
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:31,370
Castle hellsubus was
destroyed 100 years ago.
