1
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,733
Who the hell
is he trying to kid?

2
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,400
Hello? Hello, Abbeville?

3
00:01:01,442 --> 00:01:05,567
What? But if you cannot
place them, advise Paris.

4
00:01:05,608 --> 00:01:07,692
I'm at my winds end,
but carry on.

5
00:01:14,858 --> 00:01:16,775
Reinforcements, sir?

6
00:01:16,817 --> 00:01:18,942
Why don't you cut out
the clowning?

7
00:01:18,983 --> 00:01:21,775
- Me, sir? What have I done?
- Don't ever let me see you...

8
00:01:21,817 --> 00:01:24,233
doing a victory roll
over my airfield again.

9
00:01:24,275 --> 00:01:26,108
I thought it would buck up
the civilians.

10
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:29,900
For God's sake, Jamie,
give your brain a chance.

11
00:01:45,692 --> 00:01:48,067
Corporal,
refuel them immediately!

12
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:49,400
Yes, sir.

13
00:01:51,025 --> 00:01:53,650
So anyway, he hit me
and made me nose bleed...

14
00:01:53,692 --> 00:01:55,650
Corporal, I don't mean
with your blood.

15
00:01:55,692 --> 00:01:57,192
I gave him a couple of socks...

16
00:01:57,234 --> 00:01:59,109
And re-arm them.

17
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,650
Yes, sir!

18
00:02:04,484 --> 00:02:06,359
Hello, Harvey. Where's Jumbo?

19
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,275
Posted missing last night.

20
00:02:08,317 --> 00:02:09,900
You acting C.O.?

21
00:02:09,942 --> 00:02:12,067
Oh, yeah. Of what?

22
00:02:12,109 --> 00:02:15,317
Five serviceable aircraft.
No spares. No contact.

23
00:02:15,359 --> 00:02:17,734
First we knew the bastards
would overrun us...

24
00:02:17,734 --> 00:02:19,359
was when we tried to land.

25
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,275
But yes, I hear you very well.

26
00:02:21,317 --> 00:02:23,150
Eh? What?

27
00:02:23,192 --> 00:02:24,817
Are you sure?

28
00:02:24,859 --> 00:02:26,025
They are at Sedan?

29
00:02:26,067 --> 00:02:28,400
For the benefit
of the uneducated among us...

30
00:02:28,442 --> 00:02:29,775
I shall translate.

31
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:32,734
Archam can't believe
that Sedan's fallen. I can.

32
00:02:36,984 --> 00:02:39,484
It's no use. They'll be here
in half an hour.

33
00:02:39,525 --> 00:02:40,942
We must leave immediately.

34
00:02:40,942 --> 00:02:42,525
Yes, let's get
the hell out of it.

35
00:02:42,567 --> 00:02:43,859
Where to, sir?

36
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,317
Why don't you follow me
and find out? Come on, idiots.

37
00:02:46,359 --> 00:02:47,484
After you.

38
00:02:47,525 --> 00:02:49,234
Unless they've got there
before us.

39
00:02:49,275 --> 00:02:52,275
Get that buzzard out of here!
We'll go with what we've got!

40
00:02:54,734 --> 00:02:56,775
All right.
Forget your kit. Let's move.

41
00:03:02,525 --> 00:03:05,942
Get all the transport you can
and get the men out of here.

42
00:03:05,984 --> 00:03:08,442
All N.C.O. S report to me
immediately!

43
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:27,025
You know what to do
with the lame ducks?

44
00:03:27,025 --> 00:03:28,817
Yes, sir.

45
00:03:34,567 --> 00:03:36,275
Bombs away.

46
00:03:38,234 --> 00:03:40,109
All the yanks, over here!

47
00:03:41,401 --> 00:03:42,859
Load 'em up!

48
00:04:29,317 --> 00:04:30,901
Over the wing.

49
00:04:30,942 --> 00:04:32,984
Flood the cowling.

50
00:04:33,026 --> 00:04:34,442
Plenty of it.

51
00:04:43,401 --> 00:04:46,609
Right! Stand clear!
Into the trucks!

52
00:04:50,067 --> 00:04:52,567
Come on!
We haven't got all day!

53
00:05:45,776 --> 00:05:48,859
"To the permanent
Secretary of State for air...

54
00:05:48,901 --> 00:05:53,276
"Sir, I have the honor to refer

"that they may be defeated.
In this case...

62

"your obedient servant,
H.C.T. Dowding."

74
00:06:57,734 --> 00:07:00,193
Air Chief Marshal Dowding, sir.

75
00:07:04,318 --> 00:07:08,318
You do realize, Dowding,
the position this puts us in?

76
00:07:08,359 --> 00:07:12,318
I realize that the French have
been promised this squadron.

77
00:07:12,359 --> 00:07:14,943
By Churchill personally.

78
00:07:16,026 --> 00:07:18,484
He's given the French
prime minister his word.

79
00:07:20,651 --> 00:07:22,193
You do appreciate, Dowding...

80
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:24,193
that Churchill
will have to see this?

81
00:07:26,443 --> 00:07:28,276
That's why I wrote it.

82
00:08:10,651 --> 00:08:12,860
This is the BBC home service.

83
00:08:12,901 --> 00:08:14,276
Here is the news.

84
00:08:14,318 --> 00:08:16,401
In the House of Commons
this afternoon...

85
00:08:16,443 --> 00:08:18,443
the prime minister,
Mr. Churchill, said...

86
00:08:18,485 --> 00:08:22,318
"What General de Gaulle called
the Battle of France is over.

87
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,110
The battle of Britain
is about to begin."

88
00:08:59,068 --> 00:09:01,651
Eyes right!

89
00:09:12,068 --> 00:09:14,151
I welcome you in the name of
the Second Luftwaffe, General.

90
00:09:14,193 --> 00:09:15,610
Thank you, thank you,
Kesselring.

91
00:09:15,651 --> 00:09:17,068
- My dear Fink.
- General.

92
00:09:17,068 --> 00:09:18,068
Everything all right?

93
00:09:18,068 --> 00:09:19,526
We are ready, General.
We can start.

94
00:09:19,568 --> 00:09:21,401
Very well, gentlemen,
then forward.

95
00:10:53,943 --> 00:10:57,277
Attention!

96
00:10:57,318 --> 00:11:00,235
Eyes right!

97
00:11:47,735 --> 00:11:49,318
Call out the guard!

98
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,568
Call out the guard!

99
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:56,902
Attention!

100
00:12:09,819 --> 00:12:11,777
If I have to inspect
one more bomber...

101
00:12:11,819 --> 00:12:15,110
I won't recommend you for
a Field Marshal, Kesselring.

102
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:16,902
Please, may I finish
the inspection?

103
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,110
Certainly.

104
00:12:18,152 --> 00:12:19,485
Sir.

105
00:12:22,402 --> 00:12:24,277
Pleasant return journey.

106
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,694
The English are not ordained
by fate to be our enemies.

107
00:12:38,735 --> 00:12:40,444
You heard it yourself,
Jeschonnek.

108
00:12:40,485 --> 00:12:41,777
This time he's wrong.

109
00:12:41,819 --> 00:12:44,027
They are completely
finished... done for.

110
00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:47,319
We'll never have a chance
like this again.

111
00:12:47,402 --> 00:12:48,444
Absolute nonsense!

112
00:12:48,527 --> 00:12:51,069
Nonsense, do you call it?
It's a pure catastrophe.

113
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,902
Herr Baron von Richter.

114
00:12:53,944 --> 00:12:56,152
The Fuehrer
will speak to you now.

115
00:13:11,069 --> 00:13:13,402
My dear Max!

116
00:13:15,402 --> 00:13:19,819
How lovely to see you
back in Switzerland so soon.

117
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:22,694
I came straight from Berlin
an hour ago.

118
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:25,110
The ambassador
will see you now, sir.

119
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:27,319
Thank you. Excuse me, please.

120
00:13:32,735 --> 00:13:35,069
Sir David,
I'm again instructed...

121
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,819
to emphasize that
the Fuehrer wishes...

122
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,444
to avoid further bloodshed.

123
00:13:40,485 --> 00:13:42,694
England is not
our natural enemy...

124
00:13:42,735 --> 00:13:45,735
and he offers guarantees
for the British empire...

125
00:13:45,777 --> 00:13:48,319
if you give Germany
a free hand in Europe.

126
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,610
Goering and his Luftwaffe
would like to flatten London...

127
00:13:51,652 --> 00:13:53,902
as a prelude to invasion.

128
00:13:53,944 --> 00:13:56,610
It's two lumps you take,
isn't it?

129
00:13:56,652 --> 00:13:58,444
What's left of your army...

130
00:13:58,485 --> 00:14:00,527
abandoned its weapons
at Dunkirk.

131
00:14:00,569 --> 00:14:03,319
You're defenseless
and just playing for time.

132
00:14:03,361 --> 00:14:06,611
We know of the moves
you're making in Washington.

133
00:14:06,611 --> 00:14:08,861
We know the Americans
won't be drawn in.

134
00:14:08,861 --> 00:14:12,652
Their embassy in London
gives you two weeks.

135
00:14:14,027 --> 00:14:16,111
So what's stopping you?

136
00:14:18,652 --> 00:14:21,819
Look, David. The Fuehrer
is being very reasonable.

137
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,861
He offers guarantees.

138
00:14:23,902 --> 00:14:28,194
Experience shows the Fuehrer's
guarantees guarantee nothing.

139
00:14:28,236 --> 00:14:30,444
What about Churchill?

140
00:14:30,444 --> 00:14:33,194
After our last appeal,
what do we hear?

141
00:14:33,236 --> 00:14:36,027
"We will fight them
on the beaches."

142
00:14:36,069 --> 00:14:37,444
With what?

143
00:14:37,486 --> 00:14:39,861
Winston gets
carried away sometimes.

144
00:14:39,902 --> 00:14:42,152
With liquid courage.

145
00:14:42,152 --> 00:14:43,944
That's what they tell me.

146
00:14:43,986 --> 00:14:45,944
Clearly, you don't know him.

147
00:14:47,111 --> 00:14:49,611
David, we are not
asking for anything.

148
00:14:49,652 --> 00:14:51,111
Europe is ours.

149
00:14:51,152 --> 00:14:54,944
We can walk into Britain
whenever we like.

150
00:14:54,986 --> 00:14:57,152
If you think
we're going to gamble...

151
00:14:57,152 --> 00:15:01,027
on Herr Hitler's guarantees,
you're making a grave mistake.

152
00:15:01,069 --> 00:15:04,944
All those years in England seem
to have left you none the wiser.

153
00:15:04,986 --> 00:15:07,694
We're not easily frightened.

154
00:15:07,736 --> 00:15:12,527
Also, we know how hard it is for
an army to cross the channel.

155
00:15:12,569 --> 00:15:16,152
The last little corporal
to try it came a cropper.

156
00:15:16,194 --> 00:15:18,486
So don't threaten
or dictate to us...

157
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:21,777
until you're
marching up Whitehall!

158
00:15:21,819 --> 00:15:24,194
And even then we won't listen.

159
00:15:34,861 --> 00:15:36,444
Heil Hitler.

160
00:15:46,819 --> 00:15:49,694
It's unforgivable.

161
00:15:49,736 --> 00:15:52,569
I lost my temper.

162
00:15:52,611 --> 00:15:56,569
The maddening thing
is that he's right.

163
00:15:56,611 --> 00:15:58,652
We're not ready.

164
00:15:58,694 --> 00:16:00,569
We're on our own.

165
00:16:00,611 --> 00:16:04,402
We've been playing for time.

166
00:16:04,444 --> 00:16:07,153
And it's running out.

167
00:16:19,694 --> 00:16:21,819
Silly bitch!

168
00:16:21,861 --> 00:16:24,278
He's calling you
names again, Harold.

169
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:29,028
I spent half a week settling her
and the kids in the country...

170
00:16:29,069 --> 00:16:30,361
and now,
"I'm bored," she says!

171
00:16:44,986 --> 00:16:47,778
One of your elite
trying to land without wheels.

172
00:17:04,236 --> 00:17:06,653
Boomps-a-daisy.

173
00:17:06,694 --> 00:17:08,944
It's enough to make you weep.

174
00:17:28,986 --> 00:17:32,153
And welcome home, sir.

175
00:17:32,153 --> 00:17:35,153
Undercarriage lever
a bit sticky, was it, sir?

176
00:17:35,194 --> 00:17:37,153
Yes, as a matter of fact,
it was.

177
00:17:37,153 --> 00:17:40,569
Well, I wouldn't tell the C.O.
That, sir, not if I were you.

178
00:18:01,778 --> 00:18:03,444
You can teach...

179
00:18:03,486 --> 00:18:07,153
monkeys to fly
better than that!

180
00:18:11,695 --> 00:18:13,861
I'm terribly sorry
about that, sir.

181
00:18:13,903 --> 00:18:17,111
- It won't happen again.
- Keep your jacket on, boy.

182
00:18:17,111 --> 00:18:19,195
How many hours have you done
in spits, Simon?

183
00:18:19,236 --> 00:18:21,695
On spits, sir? 10 1/2.

184
00:18:21,736 --> 00:18:26,361
We'll make it eleven before
Jerry has you for breakfast.

185
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:35,903
Spring chicken to shite hawk
in one easy lesson.

186
00:18:38,403 --> 00:18:41,611
Attack, attack, attack...

187
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:44,111
This is Rabbit Leader.
Are you receiving me?

188
00:18:44,153 --> 00:18:46,486
Hello, Rabbit Leader.
Red-3 on 3.

189
00:18:46,528 --> 00:18:48,445
Receiving you loud and clear.

190
00:18:48,486 --> 00:18:50,695
Right. I'll try
and get on your tail...

191
00:18:50,736 --> 00:18:54,153
and I want you to take
evasive action. Understood?

192
00:18:54,195 --> 00:18:55,570
Hello, Rabbit Leader.

193
00:18:55,611 --> 00:18:58,111
Red-3 on 3. Understood.

194
00:19:23,486 --> 00:19:26,528
Attack, attack, attack,
attack, attack, attack...

195
00:19:28,695 --> 00:19:30,236
Hello, Rabbit Leader.

196
00:19:30,278 --> 00:19:32,403
I thought you might
come in from the sun.

197
00:19:32,445 --> 00:19:34,320
Don't think. Don't just glance.

198
00:19:34,361 --> 00:19:36,153
Look! Search for the bastards!

199
00:19:36,195 --> 00:19:38,986
And never fly in a straight
line, or you're a dead duck.

200
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:42,736
- Sir.
- Now, let's try it again.

201
00:19:49,236 --> 00:19:52,611
Or, in other words,
beware of the Hun in the sun...

202
00:19:52,653 --> 00:19:54,403
who, for reasons best
known to himself...

203
00:19:54,403 --> 00:19:57,278
has confined his recent attacks
to our channel convoys.

204
00:19:57,278 --> 00:19:59,403
However,
this won't last forever.

205
00:19:59,445 --> 00:20:02,361
But it has given us a chance
to pull ourselves together...

206
00:20:02,403 --> 00:20:03,820
and to train people like you.

207
00:20:03,861 --> 00:20:06,570
As fighter controllers, you'll
be joining an organization...

208
00:20:06,611 --> 00:20:07,736
which, thank the good Lord...

209
00:20:07,778 --> 00:20:09,486
was not rushed up
hastily yesterday.

210
00:20:09,528 --> 00:20:12,153
It'll be a pain in the neck
to the enemy when he comes.

211
00:20:12,195 --> 00:20:14,111
It's the joker up our sleeves.

212
00:20:14,111 --> 00:20:16,278
Now, the R.A.F. Chain
shows us where they are.

213
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,820
The information
is passed to group...

214
00:20:17,862 --> 00:20:19,362
group scrambles
the necessary squadrons...

215
00:20:19,403 --> 00:20:21,362
and you, at sector level...

216
00:20:21,403 --> 00:20:25,153
guide our chaps
to the interception.

217
00:20:25,153 --> 00:20:28,237
It's been tried and tested.
It works.

218
00:20:28,278 --> 00:20:32,195
So don't blame the system
if you're no good.

219
00:20:32,195 --> 00:20:34,903
Now, clearly, 11 Group here...

220
00:20:34,903 --> 00:20:36,820
will bear the brunt
of the battle...

221
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,737
as those of you
who are posted there...

222
00:20:38,778 --> 00:20:40,695
will find out
to your discomfort.

223
00:20:40,737 --> 00:20:42,403
12 Group is our second line
of defense...

224
00:20:42,445 --> 00:20:44,028
and covers the industrial
midlands and the north.

225
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:46,237
13 Group, Scotland
and the northeast...

226
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:48,778
and 10 Group,
the west of England.

227
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,695
More than half
the fighter-command squadrons...

228
00:20:50,778 --> 00:20:52,653
are stationed here
at 11 Group...

229
00:20:52,653 --> 00:20:55,362
near the coast where we
expect the invasion...

230
00:20:55,403 --> 00:20:56,820
and also able
to protect London...

231
00:20:56,862 --> 00:21:00,570
which is as far as the bombers
can get with fighter escort.

232
00:21:00,612 --> 00:21:02,528
But I think
we can leave strategy...

233
00:21:02,612 --> 00:21:04,237
to those with egg
on their hats.

234
00:21:04,278 --> 00:21:06,695
Attention!

235
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:23,820
Please, gentlemen, the Inspector
General has just arrived.

236
00:21:28,237 --> 00:21:29,362
Here.

237
00:21:29,403 --> 00:21:30,945
Thank you, Captain.

238
00:21:34,903 --> 00:21:36,653
Ah, my dear Foehn.
You are well?

239
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:37,945
- Yes, thank you, General.
- And Falke?

240
00:21:37,987 --> 00:21:39,528
Yes, thank you, General.

241
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:41,903
May I introduce
my brother Hans, sir?

242
00:21:41,945 --> 00:21:43,237
Another fighter ace perhaps?

243
00:21:43,237 --> 00:21:45,862
When I get the chance
to fight, General.

244
00:21:45,903 --> 00:21:47,487
General.

245
00:21:47,528 --> 00:21:50,278
We have borrowed this.

246
00:21:54,445 --> 00:21:56,070
- Dover?
- Dover.

247
00:21:57,278 --> 00:22:00,820
Those masts are their
radio direction finders?

248
00:22:00,862 --> 00:22:03,153
Yes. Their secret weapon.

249
00:22:03,195 --> 00:22:04,862
Which we captured at Dunkirk.

250
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:10,112
Our Stukas can deal with them.

251
00:22:10,153 --> 00:22:12,362
Excuse me, General, but why?

252
00:22:12,362 --> 00:22:14,987
If they know we're coming,
so much the better.

253
00:22:15,028 --> 00:22:16,820
We don't have to look for them.

254
00:22:18,195 --> 00:22:20,070
The pilots are in excellent
spirits, General.

255
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:22,695
I have eyes in my head,
Osterkamp.

256
00:22:22,737 --> 00:22:24,612
I merely wanted to say,
General...

257
00:22:24,654 --> 00:22:26,112
we shouldn't wait too long.

258
00:22:26,154 --> 00:22:28,029
It may happen sooner
than you think.

259
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,654
Please, gentlemen.

260
00:22:30,945 --> 00:22:32,154
Come, Falke.

261
00:22:32,195 --> 00:22:33,445
Thank you, General.

262
00:22:39,904 --> 00:22:43,195
This delay is an incredible
piece of luck.

263
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:47,445
I mean, they roll up France
and then stop.

264
00:22:47,487 --> 00:22:49,612
They could've come right on.

265
00:22:49,654 --> 00:22:52,695
You know,
our latest intelligence...

266
00:22:52,737 --> 00:22:57,320
is that Herr Hitler
is sightseeing in France.

267
00:22:57,362 --> 00:22:59,404
'Tis rather pleasant weather.

268
00:22:59,445 --> 00:23:01,862
Oh, no, I mean it.
He's on holiday.

269
00:23:01,904 --> 00:23:03,654
I'm not complaining, Minister.

270
00:23:03,695 --> 00:23:05,404
No, no, no,
seriously, Dowding...

271
00:23:05,445 --> 00:23:07,862
the morale factor is vital.

272
00:23:07,945 --> 00:23:09,820
I saw Beaverbrook on Monday.

273
00:23:09,862 --> 00:23:12,070
Now, he's going
to be able to deliver...

274
00:23:12,112 --> 00:23:15,112
as many as
a hundred fighters a week.

275
00:23:15,154 --> 00:23:18,154
Well, after seeing you...

276
00:23:18,195 --> 00:23:20,154
I want to be able to go
back to the cabinet...

277
00:23:20,195 --> 00:23:23,987
and tell them you're
as confident as I am.

278
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:28,070
Damn it, man,
we've got 650 planes.

279
00:23:28,112 --> 00:23:32,529
And they have 2,500 aircraft,
haven't they?

280
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:36,529
They won't all come over
at once, and we have radar.

281
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:38,779
Churchill puts great faith
in radar.

282
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:42,737
It's vital, but it won't
shoot down aircraft.

283
00:23:42,779 --> 00:23:47,529
I must say, you don't exactly
exude a spirit of optimism.

284
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:50,612
God willing,
we will hold out, Minister.

285
00:23:50,654 --> 00:23:53,945
I see. So I tell
the cabinet...

286
00:23:53,987 --> 00:23:57,445
that you're trusting in radar
and praying to God... right?

287
00:23:57,487 --> 00:23:59,904
More accurate
the other way around.

288
00:23:59,945 --> 00:24:02,612
I'm trusting in God
and praying for radar.

289
00:24:02,654 --> 00:24:05,654
But the essential arithmetic
is that our young men...

290
00:24:05,695 --> 00:24:07,987
will have to shoot down
their young men...

291
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:12,737
at the rate of four to one
if we're to keep pace at all.

292
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:18,070
It's the oil pressure, sir,
but the gauge is being checked.

293
00:24:18,112 --> 00:24:20,612
- All right, Charlie. Carry on.
- Thank you, sir.

294
00:24:20,654 --> 00:24:22,195
Never give up,
do you, Charlie?

295
00:24:22,237 --> 00:24:23,487
Instrument check, sir.

296
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:26,362
I hope your new C.O.
Believes you.

297
00:24:26,404 --> 00:24:28,279
He's going to be
one of your headaches now.

298
00:24:28,321 --> 00:24:30,862
They know the orders...
don't tangle unnecessarily.

299
00:24:30,904 --> 00:24:33,237
So it's "May I do
an engine check, sir?

300
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,029
"Or an undercarriage
check or a radio?"

301
00:24:35,071 --> 00:24:36,612
Any excuse
to get at the Jerries.

302
00:24:36,654 --> 00:24:38,529
At least it shows they're keen.

303
00:24:38,571 --> 00:24:40,446
Yeah, they're a good bunch.

304
00:24:40,487 --> 00:24:42,362
God knows what I'll find
in Scotland.

305
00:24:42,404 --> 00:24:44,946
A lot of kids with down
on their cheeks.

306
00:24:44,987 --> 00:24:46,362
Yeah, training them
to be fighter pilots...

307
00:24:46,404 --> 00:24:48,362
is a damn sight more dodgy
than fighting Germans.

308
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:50,321
Well, you've got to earn
that new stripe somehow.

309
00:24:50,362 --> 00:24:52,737
At least I got
three days in town.

310
00:24:52,779 --> 00:24:54,571
Give my regards to your wife.

311
00:24:54,612 --> 00:24:55,737
Thanks.

312
00:24:58,071 --> 00:25:00,071
May I have a word, sir?

313
00:25:03,946 --> 00:25:05,529
Send us back a haggis.

314
00:25:10,529 --> 00:25:12,862
If you want permission
for a test flight...

315
00:25:12,904 --> 00:25:14,821
the answer is no.

316
00:25:38,529 --> 00:25:40,529
Large scotch, please.

317
00:25:40,571 --> 00:25:42,821
You with that lot
down the road, sir?

318
00:25:42,862 --> 00:25:44,154
No.

319
00:25:44,154 --> 00:25:46,071
One and six, please.

320
00:25:46,071 --> 00:25:47,446
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

321
00:25:55,404 --> 00:25:57,612
Have you applied
for that post in Scotland?

322
00:25:57,654 --> 00:25:59,029
- Darling, I can't.
- You can't.

323
00:25:59,071 --> 00:26:00,237
You know I can't.

324
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:03,154
- You mean you don't want to.
- Can't. I've got a job.

325
00:26:03,196 --> 00:26:05,696
What have we got?
What the hell is this?

326
00:26:05,737 --> 00:26:08,029
Is it a marriage or a flaming
air force committee?

327
00:26:08,071 --> 00:26:11,862
For God's sake, Colin,
don't start that all over again.

328
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:13,446
I knew this would happen.

329
00:26:13,487 --> 00:26:15,071
I never wanted you
to join up... never.

330
00:26:15,112 --> 00:26:18,987
Colin, please, try to behave
as if I were a human being.

331
00:26:19,029 --> 00:26:22,571
You look more like a
parade-ground suffragette to me.

332
00:26:22,612 --> 00:26:25,904
I'm just not cut out to wave
a wet hankie on sooty stations.

333
00:26:25,904 --> 00:26:28,987
For God's sake,
who's asking you to?

334
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:31,529
We'll be
in Scotland together.

335
00:26:31,571 --> 00:26:34,404
I never could stand
marching women.

336
00:26:36,196 --> 00:26:37,988
You couldn't care less,
could you?

337
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:40,613
I cared enough
to come here fifty miles.

338
00:26:40,613 --> 00:26:42,821
I didn't measure it.

339
00:26:42,863 --> 00:26:44,071
I did.

340
00:26:46,613 --> 00:26:48,529
I even booked a room.

341
00:26:52,696 --> 00:26:53,863
Three days.

342
00:26:57,113 --> 00:26:58,654
It would be marvelous.

343
00:27:03,238 --> 00:27:05,904
Are you going to apply
for that posting or not?

344
00:27:05,946 --> 00:27:07,654
Left, right, left.

345
00:27:07,696 --> 00:27:10,529
Right, left, right, left, right.

346
00:27:10,571 --> 00:27:13,238
Squad, halt!

347
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,654
Right turn!

348
00:27:16,654 --> 00:27:19,321
Order arms!

349
00:27:21,154 --> 00:27:22,696
Now, wait for it.

350
00:27:22,738 --> 00:27:24,154
Squad...

351
00:27:24,196 --> 00:27:26,238
dismissed!

352
00:27:30,904 --> 00:27:32,946
Come on, Albert,
you're not dead yet.

353
00:27:32,988 --> 00:27:35,321
- It's his turn.
- You'll be lucky.

354
00:27:35,363 --> 00:27:37,988
Twelve pints, please, Fred.

355
00:27:38,029 --> 00:27:39,488
One for the sarge.

356
00:27:39,529 --> 00:27:41,113
Let him get his own.

357
00:27:48,821 --> 00:27:51,238
No, sir, it's not Charlie.

358
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,821
It's some Hurricane
out of juice very likely.

359
00:27:53,863 --> 00:27:57,946
Right. Call me directly
you hear anything.

360
00:28:09,696 --> 00:28:12,071
Well, somebody
must have spotted him.

361
00:28:12,113 --> 00:28:14,613
He can't just disappear.

362
00:28:14,654 --> 00:28:16,779
All right, I'll hang on.

363
00:28:16,821 --> 00:28:19,738
Sir, it's
Air Vice Marshal Park.

364
00:28:19,779 --> 00:28:21,488
That's all we need now.

365
00:28:21,529 --> 00:28:23,696
Jamie, hang onto this.

366
00:28:25,696 --> 00:28:27,113
Good afternoon, sir.

367
00:28:27,154 --> 00:28:29,071
Tell your men to relax.

368
00:28:30,196 --> 00:28:32,238
How are they making out,
Canfield?

369
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:34,279
Half the squadron
are new pilots, sir.

370
00:28:34,321 --> 00:28:37,280
That's why you were sent here,
to lick them into shape.

371
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,280
They get less warning here
than any other station...

372
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,280
so they must learn
to get up from standby...

373
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:44,196
in two minutes flat if they're
to intercept the enemy.

374
00:28:46,321 --> 00:28:48,113
Hello. Dispersal.

375
00:28:49,696 --> 00:28:50,988
Right.

376
00:28:52,405 --> 00:28:54,030
Stand down, "A" flight.

377
00:29:06,488 --> 00:29:07,780
Yours?

378
00:29:09,071 --> 00:29:10,946
Yes, sir.

379
00:29:10,988 --> 00:29:12,613
The chaps spoil her.

380
00:29:13,863 --> 00:29:16,280
All right, Canfield, what's up?

381
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,613
You have a pilot missing.

382
00:29:18,655 --> 00:29:20,071
Yes, sir.

383
00:29:20,113 --> 00:29:21,863
Over the channel.

384
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:26,280
Is he much overdue?

385
00:29:26,321 --> 00:29:27,738
Over two hours, sir.

386
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:30,321
I thought I'd made it clear
we're too near the enemy...

387
00:29:30,363 --> 00:29:32,405
for pilots to go
swanning around on their own.

388
00:29:32,446 --> 00:29:35,905
We can't afford
to lose them this way.

389
00:29:35,946 --> 00:29:39,738
What's the excuse this time,
undercarriage check?

390
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,030
Instruments, sir.

391
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:43,905
We've all done it,
but that's no excuse.

392
00:29:43,946 --> 00:29:45,988
What's his name?

393
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,988
Pilot officer Lambert, sir.

394
00:30:03,696 --> 00:30:05,738
Gerhardt, my bath!

395
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,696
Yes, certainly, Major.

396
00:30:15,321 --> 00:30:17,321
Do me a favor. Not now, Papa.

397
00:30:17,363 --> 00:30:19,405
These are the day's instructions
for the Luftwaffe...

398
00:30:19,446 --> 00:30:22,321
- and they must go off today.
- All right, if I must.

399
00:30:32,571 --> 00:30:35,446
I know, you have just found it.

400
00:30:35,488 --> 00:30:38,155
That doesn't concern you.
Hurry up, old man...

401
00:30:38,196 --> 00:30:40,155
because my evening meal
will not wait for you.

402
00:30:40,197 --> 00:30:43,572
In exactly five minutes,
we drive to Boulogne, OK?

403
00:30:48,155 --> 00:30:50,780
Hans, look after Major Foehn.

404
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,197
Good evening, sir.
May I lead the way?

405
00:30:55,238 --> 00:30:57,197
Certainly, my boy. Lead on.

406
00:30:57,238 --> 00:30:59,988
Don't let him
near the wine cellar!

407
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:06,863
What's the best way to evade
a Spitfire, Major, shallow dive?

408
00:31:06,905 --> 00:31:08,572
And curving in
at the same time.

409
00:31:08,613 --> 00:31:10,488
But excuse me, Major,
my brother says...

410
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:12,822
a Spitfire
can outmaneuver a 109.

411
00:31:12,863 --> 00:31:15,030
When we are in England,
let him take up a Spitfire...

412
00:31:15,072 --> 00:31:17,030
and prove it to me in my 109.

413
00:31:17,072 --> 00:31:19,780
Done! But don't forget
your life jacket!

414
00:31:19,822 --> 00:31:25,072
I said look after our guest,
Hans, not drown him.

415
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,988
Major Foehn doesn't think much
of the shot-method.

416
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:33,155
If you would teach your boys
to shoot a little sharper...

417
00:31:33,197 --> 00:31:34,530
the problem wouldn't arise.

418
00:31:34,572 --> 00:31:37,363
Excuse me, Jafu II.
You are to report to Wissant.

419
00:31:37,405 --> 00:31:39,280
- What, now, Papa?
- Immediately.

420
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,447
And Major Foehn also.

421
00:32:01,447 --> 00:32:04,613
I think I know why we've been
asked to go to Wissant.

422
00:32:18,988 --> 00:32:21,030
This is it.

423
00:32:40,238 --> 00:32:43,822
Gentlemen... Eagle Day!

424
00:32:43,863 --> 00:32:47,364
The destruction of the Royal
Air Force on the ground.

425
00:32:47,405 --> 00:32:49,697
Zero hour for takeoff 7:15 A.M.

426
00:32:49,697 --> 00:32:51,947
Our targets today
in southern England...

427
00:32:51,989 --> 00:32:55,114
are the following airfields.

428
00:32:55,155 --> 00:32:58,197
Manston, Biggin, Kenley...

429
00:32:58,239 --> 00:33:01,197
Dover, Hawkinge.

430
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:05,905
It is our task to destroy
the R.A.F. On the ground.

431
00:33:05,947 --> 00:33:08,322
There'll be nothing left for us.

432
00:33:08,322 --> 00:33:10,614
Don't worry, gentlemen...

433
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,905
our omnibus drivers won't
be able to destroy everything.

434
00:33:12,947 --> 00:33:15,947
Some Spitfires
will remain, anyway.

435
00:33:15,989 --> 00:33:17,905
Even for you, Bruno.

436
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:21,405
Therefore, gentlemen...

437
00:33:21,447 --> 00:33:23,822
fly in at maximum height
and make good use of it.

438
00:33:23,864 --> 00:33:26,447
And try not to land
in the Channel.

439
00:33:26,489 --> 00:33:29,280
Especially use your eyes
and watch your petrol gauges.

440
00:33:29,322 --> 00:33:31,739
Remember, you've only got
thirty minutes over there.

441
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,655
Come on, chaps.

442
00:34:32,114 --> 00:34:34,030
Away, I'm here.

443
00:35:26,197 --> 00:35:28,489
Hostile 2-3.

444
00:35:28,531 --> 00:35:29,656
Morning, all.

445
00:35:29,697 --> 00:35:34,364
Bearing 1-8-6,
range thirty miles.

446
00:35:34,406 --> 00:35:35,822
Twenty plus.

447
00:35:35,864 --> 00:35:38,406
Height, six thousand.

448
00:35:38,447 --> 00:35:40,322
Yes, Danmoor, I confirm.

449
00:35:40,322 --> 00:35:41,739
No I.F.F.

450
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:51,822
Hostile 2-9, now thirty plus.

451
00:35:51,864 --> 00:35:53,906
Yes, Danmoor, I confirm.

452
00:35:53,947 --> 00:35:56,656
Recheck I.F.F., please,
Bentmarle.

453
00:36:01,364 --> 00:36:04,072
Sorry to call you in, sir,
but something's building.

454
00:36:04,114 --> 00:36:06,364
2-8 now forty plus.

455
00:36:06,406 --> 00:36:08,531
Convoys?

456
00:36:08,572 --> 00:36:10,989
None due through
until tonight, sir.

457
00:36:12,822 --> 00:36:16,322
Hostile 3-1 forty plus, 1-6.

458
00:36:16,322 --> 00:36:18,947
Better bring
more squadrons to standby.

459
00:36:18,989 --> 00:36:21,072
Right, sir. Get me Beacon Hill.

460
00:36:21,114 --> 00:36:23,739
Reconfirm Hostile 2-3.

461
00:36:23,781 --> 00:36:26,614
Hostile 2-3, 1-8-0.

462
00:36:26,656 --> 00:36:28,906
Getting interference
again, sir.

463
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:33,614
Not now, corporal, not now.

464
00:36:33,614 --> 00:36:34,906
That's better.

465
00:36:34,906 --> 00:36:36,406
Five miles.

466
00:36:36,447 --> 00:36:40,781
I'm afraid the raid is entering
my ground range, Danmoor.

467
00:36:53,031 --> 00:36:54,323
Stukas.

468
00:37:36,614 --> 00:37:38,031
Get them up.

469
00:37:38,073 --> 00:37:40,448
43 Squadron,
intercept Hostile 2-1.

470
00:37:40,489 --> 00:37:42,073
That was Danmoor, sir.

471
00:37:42,114 --> 00:37:44,281
Ventnar radar out of action.

472
00:37:47,948 --> 00:37:49,364
Who's covering Dover?

473
00:37:49,406 --> 00:37:51,489
54 Squadron, sir.

474
00:38:00,989 --> 00:38:02,406
6th Squadron's airborne, sir.

475
00:38:02,448 --> 00:38:05,198
Too slow. Some of them
took six and seven minutes.

476
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:06,864
They'll have to do it in two.

477
00:38:17,573 --> 00:38:19,489
Tallyho, Velvet Leader!

478
00:38:19,531 --> 00:38:21,073
Down there on the left.

479
00:38:21,114 --> 00:38:22,656
Stukas!

480
00:38:22,698 --> 00:38:24,739
Roger. Here we go.

481
00:38:24,781 --> 00:38:26,364
Attacking now.

482
00:38:34,864 --> 00:38:38,614
Yellow section, keep your eyes
peeled for the escort.

483
00:38:45,989 --> 00:38:47,781
Spitfire!

484
00:39:42,823 --> 00:39:44,990
Easier to hit than a barn door.

485
00:39:45,031 --> 00:39:47,198
It's like shooting rats
in a barrel.

486
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,448
You'll be in a barrel...

487
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:50,531
if you don't watch out
for the fighters.

488
00:39:55,115 --> 00:39:57,573
What's the matter?
Can you hear me?

489
00:40:22,615 --> 00:40:25,198
Ventnar, and now Dover's
out of action.

490
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,698
- Our plots are drying up.
- Then we're blind.

491
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:30,198
So now we've only got
the observer corps.

492
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,073
This is only the beginning.

493
00:40:32,115 --> 00:40:34,365
They won't stop now.

494
00:41:00,698 --> 00:41:02,156
Heinkels.

495
00:41:06,073 --> 00:41:08,198
Make it a hundred plus.

496
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,573
Hello? Hello?
Heinkels, hundred plus.

497
00:41:15,365 --> 00:41:18,032
Yes, Center. Still going north.

498
00:41:18,073 --> 00:41:19,365
Height?

499
00:41:19,407 --> 00:41:20,948
Twelve thousand.

500
00:41:22,698 --> 00:41:24,615
Dispersal.

501
00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:26,532
2 Section, scramble!

502
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:29,115
Look alive!

503
00:41:30,407 --> 00:41:31,823
Engine trouble!

504
00:41:58,657 --> 00:41:59,782
Lookout.

505
00:41:59,823 --> 00:42:01,282
Right.

506
00:42:26,532 --> 00:42:31,282
Muck and filth everywhere,
Mr. Warrick. It's like a pigsty!

507
00:42:31,323 --> 00:42:33,240
The cooks don't come on
till 6:00.

508
00:42:33,282 --> 00:42:36,157
Well, you've got some
defaulters. Put them onto it.

509
00:42:36,157 --> 00:42:38,782
Come on you lots, move!

510
00:42:38,823 --> 00:42:41,407
You'd be there fast enough
if it was real!

511
00:42:41,407 --> 00:42:42,907
At the double!

512
00:42:49,532 --> 00:42:51,282
Oh, my God.

513
00:42:53,073 --> 00:42:54,907
Section Officer Harvey!

514
00:42:59,448 --> 00:43:00,907
Sir.

515
00:43:00,948 --> 00:43:03,448
I've noticed
that some of your girls...

516
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:06,573
are now using the men's trenches
during air raid practice.

517
00:43:06,615 --> 00:43:08,865
- It's got to stop.
- Sir.

518
00:43:08,907 --> 00:43:11,740
And another thing...
gas mask cases...

519
00:43:11,782 --> 00:43:14,532
they're for gas masks.
They're not handbags.

520
00:43:14,574 --> 00:43:16,865
I do realize, of course,
that female requirements...

521
00:43:16,907 --> 00:43:18,615
differ somewhat from the male.

522
00:43:18,657 --> 00:43:20,949
Nevertheless,
that's no excuse to...

523
00:43:23,407 --> 00:43:24,782
God's teeth!

524
00:43:24,824 --> 00:43:26,115
Take cover!

525
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:20,782
Bastards.

526
00:44:31,074 --> 00:44:33,157
At least we know
what Jerry's going for.

527
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:35,199
All our airfields,
unfortunately.

528
00:44:44,949 --> 00:44:46,699
It's a squadron scramble, sir.

529
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:49,907
Don't be wet.
Get me the duty controller.

530
00:44:49,949 --> 00:44:53,282
We've only just come down.
We're still refueling.

531
00:44:58,074 --> 00:45:00,990
Don't just stand there!
Get one up!

532
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:04,032
Corporal Johnson!

533
00:45:04,074 --> 00:45:06,199
Engine blocks away!

534
00:45:11,449 --> 00:45:13,907
Rest of you men,
in the trenches!

535
00:46:45,241 --> 00:46:46,866
Talk about a hairy takeoff.

536
00:46:46,907 --> 00:46:49,532
- I saw Jimmy buy it.
- Did Archie get off?

537
00:46:49,574 --> 00:46:52,824
Oh, I'm with you old boy,
but I've left my stomach behind.

538
00:46:52,866 --> 00:46:54,824
Ah, shut up, will you!

539
00:46:54,866 --> 00:46:57,824
Rabbit Leader
to Cowslip Control.

540
00:46:57,866 --> 00:46:59,449
Do you read me? Over.

541
00:47:03,157 --> 00:47:05,991
For Christ's sake, Cowslip,
wake up, will you?

542
00:47:06,032 --> 00:47:07,949
Rabbit Squadron airborne.

543
00:47:10,491 --> 00:47:12,324
Close up, Red-2!

544
00:47:15,116 --> 00:47:18,449
Stick to me like glue, Simon.

545
00:47:18,449 --> 00:47:21,741
Rabbit Leader, sorry about that.
This is Cowslip.

546
00:47:21,783 --> 00:47:24,033
About time, too.
Where'd they go?

547
00:47:24,074 --> 00:47:27,991
Bandits now twenty miles
east of you heading southeast.

548
00:47:28,033 --> 00:47:32,116
Sector 1-2-0
and make Angels 2-0.

549
00:47:32,158 --> 00:47:33,783
We'll go, Cowslip.

550
00:47:33,824 --> 00:47:36,866
Rabbit's turning port... now.

551
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:51,616
Come in, Red-2.
Where the hell are you?

552
00:47:53,074 --> 00:47:55,449
Where the hell are you, Simon?

553
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:33,324
You, lads, pull
yourselves together!

554
00:48:33,366 --> 00:48:36,366
Get moving!
Get another shovel!

555
00:48:44,658 --> 00:48:46,658
Bates, pull yourself together.

556
00:48:48,658 --> 00:48:50,116
Stay with them, Seymour.

557
00:48:53,033 --> 00:48:55,241
It's all right. I'll see to it.

558
00:48:55,283 --> 00:48:57,324
How about two hands
over here, Officer?

559
00:48:59,366 --> 00:49:01,449
Run the hoses out over here!

560
00:49:33,283 --> 00:49:35,700
Put that cigarette out!

561
00:49:35,741 --> 00:49:38,741
The mains have gone!
Can't you smell gas?

562
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:48,783
Don't you yell at me,
Mr. Warrick!

563
00:49:51,991 --> 00:49:53,533
Here, you men!

564
00:49:53,575 --> 00:49:56,866
Don't stand there looking
at it, you idle shover!

565
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:04,241
You! Get me some stretchers
and the orderly.

566
00:50:04,283 --> 00:50:06,075
- Ma'am.
- Fast!

567
00:50:10,116 --> 00:50:11,991
You can stand some of the girls
down now, Corporal.

568
00:50:12,033 --> 00:50:13,575
Jones, Whitman,
clear up that mess.

569
00:50:13,616 --> 00:50:15,158
Then you can take five minutes.

570
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,533
43, stand down.

571
00:50:16,575 --> 00:50:18,283
1-1-1 released.

572
00:50:18,325 --> 00:50:20,283
5-0-1 are down at Tangbear.

573
00:50:20,325 --> 00:50:21,950
They couldn't get in
at Big Wing.

574
00:50:21,991 --> 00:50:23,491
Few more days like this...

575
00:50:23,533 --> 00:50:25,241
and we won't be able
to get them down anywhere.

576
00:50:25,283 --> 00:50:27,033
I suppose we could always
pull them all back...

577
00:50:27,033 --> 00:50:29,325
north of the Thames,
out of range.

578
00:50:29,366 --> 00:50:32,408
That is precisely what
they want us to do.

579
00:50:52,283 --> 00:50:54,325
This is the BBC home service.

580
00:50:54,366 --> 00:50:56,616
Here is the 9:00 news.

581
00:50:56,658 --> 00:50:58,533
Large formations
of enemy aircraft...

582
00:50:58,575 --> 00:51:01,450
today attacked targets
in southern England...

583
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:05,158
but the enemy's aerial armada
came in for heavy punishment.

584
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,658
Over forty-seven German planes
were destroyed...

585
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:10,491
with a loss of only fifteen
of our own aircraft.

586
00:51:10,491 --> 00:51:12,491
Six of these pilots were saved.

587
00:51:12,491 --> 00:51:15,741
Several R.A.F. Aerodromes
were also attacked...

588
00:51:15,783 --> 00:51:18,241
and some casualties
were sustained...

589
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:20,158
but they were light.

590
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:29,992
Colonel.

591
00:51:31,158 --> 00:51:33,283
Good. Very good.

592
00:51:34,242 --> 00:51:36,200
The weather is constant.

593
00:51:36,242 --> 00:51:38,200
We have a stabilized
high pressure zone...

594
00:51:38,242 --> 00:51:39,575
and we'll make use of it.

595
00:51:39,617 --> 00:51:41,492
The proof, gentlemen.
We are destroying...

596
00:51:41,533 --> 00:51:43,533
as many planes on the ground
as in the air.

597
00:51:43,575 --> 00:51:45,825
Thank you, Schmidt.
On the desk, please.

598
00:51:47,158 --> 00:51:49,117
Reichsmarschall Goering
will certainly be interested...

599
00:51:49,158 --> 00:51:50,867
in my report.

600
00:51:50,908 --> 00:51:54,658
To date, almost 300 planes
have been destroyed.

601
00:51:58,783 --> 00:52:02,617
Almost half the entire British
fighter force, gentlemen.

602
00:52:05,075 --> 00:52:07,533
The Colonel can report
what he pleases.

603
00:52:07,575 --> 00:52:08,867
The fact remains...

604
00:52:08,908 --> 00:52:10,950
that our bombers continue
to be intercepted.

605
00:52:10,992 --> 00:52:13,450
Because the English are now
bringing in their reserves.

606
00:52:13,492 --> 00:52:17,533
As from tomorrow, we'll increase
our attacks on these airfields.

607
00:52:17,575 --> 00:52:23,283
And five Luftwaffes will attack
the north and north-east.

608
00:52:23,325 --> 00:52:27,075
But that is outside the range
of our fighters, Colonel.

609
00:52:27,117 --> 00:52:30,158
Also outside the range
of the English fighters.

610
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:34,075
Not even a Spitfire can be
in the north and the south...
at the same time
.

611
00:52:53,528 --> 00:52:55,992
How far are we from the coast?

612
00:53:01,232 --> 00:53:03,728
Everybody, Action Stations.

613
00:53:05,276 --> 00:53:10,025
Tomato Heinz to all.
Tomato Heinz to all.

614
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:12,817
Another ten minutes to target.

615
00:53:12,852 --> 00:53:15,130
All ready at Fighter Stations.

616
00:53:15,163 --> 00:53:18,435
Another ten minutes
to target. End.

617
00:53:23,314 --> 00:53:26,041
Look! Spitfire!

618
00:53:34,454 --> 00:53:37,278
Help yourself, everybody.
There's no fighter escort.

619
00:54:15,349 --> 00:54:16,783
There! Right behind us!

620
00:56:05,312 --> 00:56:07,723
Soapbox Leader, break it off.

621
00:56:07,755 --> 00:56:09,167
Home and tea.

622
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,761
For once you deserve it.
Well done, everybody.

623
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:35,035
Heinkel, three-second burst.

624
00:56:35,076 --> 00:56:37,411
Starboard engine.
Ruddy great flamer.

625
00:56:37,444 --> 00:56:39,233
Any identification marks?

626
00:56:39,269 --> 00:56:40,698
Yellow stripes on the wings.

627
00:56:40,741 --> 00:56:42,978
Wing leader. See it go down?

628
00:56:43,013 --> 00:56:45,763
Did I? Nyaow... plunk!

629
00:56:45,797 --> 00:56:48,929
Hmm. Graham and Jack
will confirm your story.

630
00:56:48,965 --> 00:56:50,853
That's three of you who got him.

631
00:56:52,486 --> 00:56:55,421
1/3 of a kill, laddie, 1/3.

632
00:56:56,422 --> 00:56:57,567
Sir.

633
00:56:58,983 --> 00:57:01,634
- What did you hit?
- A Heinkel.

634
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:04,540
- Anyone see mine go in?
- Didn't know you were with us.

635
00:57:06,247 --> 00:57:07,709
Well done, Peter.

636
00:57:08,776 --> 00:57:11,197
Only 1/3 of a one, sir.

637
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:12,996
Oh, that's better than nothing.

638
00:57:13,032 --> 00:57:16,927
I used to blast away
and never hit a sausage.

639
00:57:16,969 --> 00:57:18,081
One thing though...

640
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:19,527
What's that, sir?

641
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:23,390
It takes us two years
to train people like you.

642
00:57:23,433 --> 00:57:26,532
Suppose your controls
had been damaged.

643
00:57:26,569 --> 00:57:28,904
What would've happened
to that idiotic victory roll?

644
00:57:28,938 --> 00:57:30,847
You'd have been spread
all over the damn field...

645
00:57:30,889 --> 00:57:34,151
like strawberry jam.
Never again. Clear?

646
00:57:34,186 --> 00:57:35,331
Yes, sir.

647
00:57:41,739 --> 00:57:44,128
Something to make Stuffy's day.

648
00:57:44,171 --> 00:57:47,466
The old man's just gone down
to the OPs room with Sasha.

649
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:48,744
Final figures
of the northern raids...

650
00:57:48,779 --> 00:57:51,333
twenty-three without loss.

651
00:57:51,372 --> 00:57:53,412
Jolly good.
I'll show it to him.

652
00:57:53,452 --> 00:57:54,827
Right.

653
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:58,057
We're getting 6 volunteer pilots
from Coastal Command...

654
00:57:58,093 --> 00:58:00,002
and from
the Fleet Air Arms, sir...

655
00:58:00,044 --> 00:58:02,052
five from each of the Fairday
battle squadrons...

656
00:58:02,093 --> 00:58:04,777
and three from
army cooperation.

657
00:58:04,813 --> 00:58:07,977
That's thirty, is it?
Not enough.

658
00:58:08,014 --> 00:58:09,803
We lost that many yesterday.

659
00:58:09,837 --> 00:58:12,325
And the air staff hesitate
to weaken the light bombers...

660
00:58:12,365 --> 00:58:13,707
in case of invasion, sir.

661
00:58:13,742 --> 00:58:15,149
We need pilots now.

662
00:58:15,182 --> 00:58:17,550
What about the foreign squadrons
under training?

663
00:58:17,582 --> 00:58:18,989
Czechs, Poles?

664
00:58:19,023 --> 00:58:21,292
I know your feelings about
the language difficulties.

665
00:58:21,327 --> 00:58:23,815
They don't understand a word
that's said over the air.

666
00:58:23,855 --> 00:58:25,895
They're a menace
to themselves and us.

667
00:58:25,935 --> 00:58:29,548
I'll try and cut more corners
off the training program.

668
00:58:29,584 --> 00:58:32,202
Pilots are doing well...

669
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,215
enemy losing
at the rate of two to one...

670
00:58:34,256 --> 00:58:36,166
then he can afford to, can't he?

671
00:58:36,209 --> 00:58:40,235
Never sends more than half
his bombers at one time.

672
00:58:40,273 --> 00:58:44,299
We must find more pilots...

673
00:58:44,337 --> 00:58:45,931
or lose.

674
00:58:51,314 --> 00:58:53,005
Begin. This is off speed.

675
00:58:53,042 --> 00:58:55,311
Check 5-0-1 back
at ready desk...

676
00:59:01,875 --> 00:59:04,242
I think you ought
to see this, sir.

677
00:59:07,636 --> 00:59:08,814
Thank you.

678
00:59:21,301 --> 00:59:23,210
Air raid warning.

679
00:59:23,254 --> 00:59:25,588
Sector Three Red.

680
00:59:47,415 --> 00:59:49,685
Rabbit Squadron.

681
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:52,241
Tallyho, tallyho, Red Section.

682
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:54,287
We'll take the rear starboard.

683
00:59:54,329 --> 00:59:56,336
Yellow, you take the port.

684
00:59:56,376 --> 00:59:58,515
Yellow-1 Wilco.

685
00:59:58,553 --> 01:00:00,342
Tallyho, Yellow.

686
01:00:03,545 --> 01:00:06,742
Amaliel, keep your eyes open
for the Red Squad.

687
01:00:54,367 --> 01:00:56,472
Rabbit Leader, Red-3,
you're on those bastards...

688
01:00:56,511 --> 01:00:58,583
Six o'clock high.
Coming down now.

689
01:00:58,623 --> 01:01:00,510
Roger, Red-3. I see them.

690
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:02,234
Rabbit, brave right and climb.

691
01:01:55,941 --> 01:01:58,494
Behind you, Andy! On your tail!

692
01:02:12,583 --> 01:02:14,885
Get out, Andy!

693
01:02:14,918 --> 01:02:16,195
Jump!

694
01:02:26,696 --> 01:02:28,605
Hurry up! Out!

695
01:02:31,689 --> 01:02:34,209
All out!

696
01:03:12,172 --> 01:03:14,409
Don't any of you Joes
talk English?

697
01:03:14,444 --> 01:03:15,655
Corporal!

698
01:03:16,781 --> 01:03:17,893
Sir!

699
01:03:17,933 --> 01:03:20,355
Where are you taking
those vultures?

700
01:03:20,398 --> 01:03:23,081
Officers to the mess,
ensigns to the guard room, sir.

701
01:03:23,118 --> 01:03:25,420
Like hell you are. They're
responsible for all that.

702
01:03:25,454 --> 01:03:28,269
- Get them to clear it up.
- But what about the officers?

703
01:03:28,302 --> 01:03:29,928
Give them a bloody shovel.

704
01:03:29,966 --> 01:03:31,941
Come on, step with it!

705
01:03:32,911 --> 01:03:34,820
Skipper hates Jerries.

706
01:03:34,863 --> 01:03:37,416
He'll hate me if you don't
get that gun repaired.

707
01:03:37,455 --> 01:03:39,627
Then wrap up this little lot.

708
01:03:45,648 --> 01:03:47,558
Only eight for the morning?

709
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:49,389
Got to do better than that.

710
01:03:49,424 --> 01:03:50,886
Five are write-offs.

711
01:03:50,928 --> 01:03:53,994
One has another guard gone,
and two are missing, sir.

712
01:03:54,033 --> 01:03:56,400
Mr. Anthony and Sergeant Moore.

713
01:03:56,433 --> 01:03:59,182
And these two
are hundred-hour checks.

714
01:04:02,642 --> 01:04:04,814
They've been at it
for 48 hours solid, sir.

715
01:04:04,850 --> 01:04:05,995
I know.

716
01:04:07,538 --> 01:04:09,611
Where the hell have you been?!

717
01:04:10,579 --> 01:04:11,986
Learning to swim.

718
01:04:12,019 --> 01:04:14,440
- Do your best, Blaine.
- Roger.

719
01:04:16,755 --> 01:04:18,184
You get one?

720
01:04:18,227 --> 01:04:20,780
All I got was a bellyful
of English Channel.

721
01:04:20,820 --> 01:04:22,729
When are you going to learn?

722
01:04:23,956 --> 01:04:25,330
I didn't know they were there.

723
01:04:25,364 --> 01:04:26,771
Never fly straight and level...

724
01:04:26,804 --> 01:04:29,106
for more than thirty seconds
in the combat area.

725
01:04:29,140 --> 01:04:32,174
How many times have I told you?
Come on, I'll give you a lift.

726
01:04:32,212 --> 01:04:34,067
I'd rather walk, sir.

727
01:04:34,101 --> 01:04:36,851
Cut out the "sir."

728
01:04:40,534 --> 01:04:41,941
You called your wife?

729
01:04:45,686 --> 01:04:47,726
All right, boy. Get in.

730
01:05:07,128 --> 01:05:08,535
Here you are, sir.

731
01:05:08,568 --> 01:05:09,812
Thank you.

732
01:05:13,273 --> 01:05:14,834
It's ridiculous!

733
01:05:14,873 --> 01:05:16,695
We go up four
or five times a day...

734
01:05:16,729 --> 01:05:18,616
and every time we come down,
more potholes.

735
01:05:18,649 --> 01:05:21,464
There are more potholes until we
can't bloody well get in a door.

736
01:05:21,498 --> 01:05:22,807
We'll get this place
operational again.

737
01:05:22,841 --> 01:05:24,368
You won't. Not until
someone decides...

738
01:05:24,410 --> 01:05:26,417
to protect it while we're up.

739
01:05:29,787 --> 01:05:31,827
What flaming genius
thought of sending us...

740
01:05:31,867 --> 01:05:33,361
to that dump of a flying club?

741
01:05:33,402 --> 01:05:35,508
Don't blame me.
Direct orders from group.

742
01:05:35,547 --> 01:05:38,100
Park himself.
It's not a bad little field.

743
01:05:38,140 --> 01:05:39,482
I've seen it. Damp tents...

744
01:05:39,516 --> 01:05:41,785
and a nasty little shack
full of dead flies.

745
01:05:41,820 --> 01:05:43,707
At least you won't have
the Jerries visiting you.

746
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:45,780
I don't blame them.

747
01:06:07,422 --> 01:06:09,811
How much longer, Hobbes?

748
01:06:09,855 --> 01:06:12,986
The engine's overheating,
and so am I.

749
01:06:13,023 --> 01:06:14,878
We either stand down
or blow up.

750
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:16,056
Which do you want?

751
01:06:49,379 --> 01:06:51,266
Hostile 1-6, reconfirm, please.

752
01:06:51,299 --> 01:06:54,780
Need some more
Yellow sevens, Flight.

753
01:06:54,819 --> 01:06:58,300
This is R-29,
now forty plus. 1-5.

754
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:03,802
Yes. 2-6 and 4-1 detected, sir.

755
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:06,879
7 Squadron's airborne, sir.

756
01:07:06,917 --> 01:07:09,764
Thank you. Let 12 Group know.
And make sure they know...

757
01:07:09,797 --> 01:07:11,423
they're protecting
my airfields while they're up.

758
01:07:11,461 --> 01:07:14,014
- They have been told, sir.
- Tell them again.

759
01:07:15,270 --> 01:07:18,139
Pine Tree Leader,
this is Turkey Control.

760
01:07:18,182 --> 01:07:20,833
Vector 1-9-2.

761
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:23,107
I have some trade for you
over Maidstone.

762
01:07:23,142 --> 01:07:26,492
Turkey Control,
Pine Tree Leader.

763
01:07:26,535 --> 01:07:29,405
Roger 1-9-0.

764
01:07:29,447 --> 01:07:31,749
Pine Tree, this is Turkey.

765
01:07:31,783 --> 01:07:36,519
Twenty plus bandits
and Angels 2-0 heading west.

766
01:07:36,551 --> 01:07:38,886
Roger, Turkey Control.

767
01:07:48,873 --> 01:07:51,557
Indiana left.
Making low level attack.

768
01:07:51,593 --> 01:07:55,107
Roger. I see you.
I'm breaking left to attack.

769
01:08:10,603 --> 01:08:13,637
My God!
Fighters coming down now!

770
01:08:13,676 --> 01:08:16,294
Fire speed. Break.

771
01:08:16,331 --> 01:08:17,477
Break!

772
01:08:36,526 --> 01:08:39,112
On your tail, Jamie.

773
01:09:25,875 --> 01:09:27,730
Enemy aircraft
approaching, sir.

774
01:09:27,763 --> 01:09:31,888
Coming straight for us.
Flying course, 21st.

775
01:09:31,923 --> 01:09:33,996
About eight thousand feet.

776
01:09:34,035 --> 01:09:35,857
I'm taking cover.

777
01:09:35,892 --> 01:09:37,419
Tin hats, everybody.

778
01:09:57,846 --> 01:10:00,628
That should damn well
never have happened.

779
01:10:00,663 --> 01:10:03,183
- Where the hell is 12 Group?
- They were requested, sir.

780
01:10:03,223 --> 01:10:05,557
They're nowhere in sight.

781
01:10:05,591 --> 01:10:08,079
Find out what the devil
they think they're playing at.

782
01:10:38,811 --> 01:10:41,331
They just fell on us.

783
01:10:41,370 --> 01:10:44,054
They got my number two
and the C.O.

784
01:10:44,091 --> 01:10:46,512
You saw Canfield go down?

785
01:10:46,555 --> 01:10:48,213
It blew up.

786
01:10:48,251 --> 01:10:50,040
Just blew up.

787
01:11:07,453 --> 01:11:09,144
- Bad as we thought?
- Worse.

788
01:11:09,182 --> 01:11:10,742
Kenley and Biggenor
are shambles again...

789
01:11:10,781 --> 01:11:12,025
and the rest
are not much better.

790
01:11:12,062 --> 01:11:14,910
God knows how many aircraft
we'll have in the morning.

791
01:11:14,942 --> 01:11:16,633
All because 12 Group
didn't do their stuff.

792
01:11:16,670 --> 01:11:18,906
Leigh-Mallory
and his so-called Big Wings.

793
01:11:18,942 --> 01:11:21,812
Might as well stay on the ground
for all the use they are.

794
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:23,284
We were up, sir.

795
01:11:23,327 --> 01:11:26,077
Trying to knock out
the enemy en masse.

796
01:11:27,071 --> 01:11:29,788
But it takes time to assemble 40
or 50 aircraft at 15,000 feet.

797
01:11:29,822 --> 01:11:31,611
It takes far too long.

798
01:11:31,647 --> 01:11:33,305
By the time
your Big Wing is up...

799
01:11:33,342 --> 01:11:36,604
the enemy have hit their targets
and are on their way home.

800
01:11:36,639 --> 01:11:40,469
All that matters is to shoot
them down in large numbers.

801
01:11:40,512 --> 01:11:43,360
I'd rather destroy fifty after
they've hit their targets...

802
01:11:43,392 --> 01:11:44,669
than ten before.

803
01:11:44,704 --> 01:11:47,869
Don't forget the targets are
my airfields, Leigh-Mallory...

804
01:11:47,904 --> 01:11:50,752
and you're not getting fifty.
You're not even getting ten.

805
01:11:50,784 --> 01:11:55,160
Gentlemen, you're missing
the essential truth.

806
01:11:55,201 --> 01:11:58,103
We're short
of two hundred pilots.

807
01:11:58,146 --> 01:12:01,212
Those we have are tired,
strained...

808
01:12:01,249 --> 01:12:03,868
and all overdue for relief.

809
01:12:06,050 --> 01:12:08,985
We're fighting for survival.

810
01:12:10,211 --> 01:12:11,553
Losing.

811
01:12:15,491 --> 01:12:19,288
We don't need a big wing
or a small wing.

812
01:12:19,331 --> 01:12:21,306
We need pilots.

813
01:12:27,428 --> 01:12:29,949
And a miracle.

814
01:12:29,988 --> 01:12:31,996
Good night, gentlemen.

815
01:12:34,725 --> 01:12:36,635
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, sir.

816
01:12:41,413 --> 01:12:44,381
And now, over to
the Savoy Hotel, London...

817
01:12:44,422 --> 01:12:46,310
for dance music
until midnight...

818
01:12:46,342 --> 01:12:49,539
with Carrol Gibbons
and his Savoy Hotel Orpheans.

819
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:10,270
You look a damn sight better
out of uniform.

820
01:13:10,312 --> 01:13:12,833
Hardly remember you
out of yours.

821
01:13:12,873 --> 01:13:14,815
And who's fault's that?

822
01:13:14,857 --> 01:13:17,126
For God's sake, not again.

823
01:13:17,161 --> 01:13:19,431
Look, damn it,
my squadron's come south.

824
01:13:19,465 --> 01:13:20,894
You just apply
for that posting!

825
01:13:20,938 --> 01:13:22,880
Colin, no!

826
01:13:22,922 --> 01:13:25,540
All right, agreed!
Taboo subject tonight.

827
01:13:27,850 --> 01:13:30,185
Old wafs.

828
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:52,229
You really think
we're solemnly going...

829
01:13:52,269 --> 01:13:54,789
to get into these
ridiculous garments?

830
01:13:54,829 --> 01:13:57,163
Not at this stage, surely.

831
01:13:58,798 --> 01:14:00,903
I'm shy.

832
01:14:00,941 --> 01:14:02,348
Oh, Maggie, come on.

833
01:14:03,822 --> 01:14:06,986
It's just...

834
01:14:07,022 --> 01:14:10,022
I am shy.

835
01:14:10,063 --> 01:14:11,405
Honestly.

836
01:14:17,808 --> 01:14:19,531
I'll put out the light.

837
01:14:21,103 --> 01:14:22,827
No, Colin!

838
01:14:22,864 --> 01:14:25,385
No, it's not just bed, it's us!

839
01:14:25,424 --> 01:14:26,919
It's you.

840
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:30,695
And me.

841
01:14:39,186 --> 01:14:40,648
You and me.

842
01:15:21,014 --> 01:15:23,731
We should have been over target
nine minutes ago.

843
01:15:23,766 --> 01:15:25,457
The wind has veered.

844
01:15:25,494 --> 01:15:27,087
So where are we?

845
01:15:36,984 --> 01:15:38,326
Where is London?

846
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:40,532
Far back in the south-west.

847
01:15:40,568 --> 01:15:43,438
Good. Then get rid of the bombs
and let's go home.

848
01:15:51,801 --> 01:15:53,143
Colin.

849
01:15:55,705 --> 01:15:58,422
I will put in
for that posting.

850
01:16:01,818 --> 01:16:03,028
Promise.

851
01:16:09,147 --> 01:16:10,488
That's their bombs!

852
01:16:11,612 --> 01:16:12,921
They're bombing London!

853
01:16:19,452 --> 01:16:21,492
It isn't funny! Cut it out!

854
01:16:21,532 --> 01:16:23,092
Too damn close.

855
01:16:33,053 --> 01:16:34,777
Colin, I promise.

856
01:16:36,541 --> 01:16:37,818
I promise.

857
01:16:43,198 --> 01:16:46,133
Attacks on London
are strictly forbidden.

858
01:16:48,159 --> 01:16:51,290
This order you know as well
as I do, Major Brandt.

859
01:16:51,328 --> 01:16:53,270
These attacks
may only be flown...

860
01:16:53,311 --> 01:16:55,548
on the specific order
of the Fuehrer.

861
01:16:57,024 --> 01:16:58,747
I regret, gentlemen...

862
01:16:58,784 --> 01:17:01,686
that this is now
completely out of my hands.

863
01:17:01,728 --> 01:17:04,314
By order
of Vice Marshal Goering...

864
01:17:04,353 --> 01:17:07,736
you two are to report
to Berlin to testify.

865
01:17:07,777 --> 01:17:09,370
Thank you.

866
01:17:30,275 --> 01:17:31,617
Major Brandt?

867
01:17:31,652 --> 01:17:34,499
Flying Officer Froedl.
Please follow me.

868
01:17:37,476 --> 01:17:39,003
Would you believe it?

869
01:17:39,044 --> 01:17:41,411
Don't they know
there's a blackout?

870
01:17:44,325 --> 01:17:47,587
You know what Goering said:

871
01:17:47,621 --> 01:17:52,226
"If ever a bomb falls
on Berlin...

872
01:17:52,262 --> 01:17:54,750
- "you may call me Meier."
- Hmm.

873
01:17:54,790 --> 01:17:58,533
You are to report to Colonel
Schroeder at 9 A.M. Sharp.

874
01:17:58,566 --> 01:18:00,421
This car will take you
to your quarters...

875
01:18:00,455 --> 01:18:02,691
and you are to remain there.

876
01:18:58,220 --> 01:19:00,554
"As from today,
we are called Meier."

877
01:19:02,668 --> 01:19:08,201
Last night, bombs were dropped
on Berlin by the British.

878
01:19:08,237 --> 01:19:09,514
So be it.

879
01:19:09,549 --> 01:19:13,062
That is a game
at which two can play.

880
01:19:14,830 --> 01:19:18,213
If the R.A.F. Drops
three, four...

881
01:19:18,254 --> 01:19:20,589
five thousand kilograms of bombs
on Germany in one night...

882
01:19:20,622 --> 01:19:24,005
then in one night we shall drop
three hundred...

883
01:19:24,046 --> 01:19:29,928
four hundred, five hundred,
five thousand on England!

884
01:19:36,944 --> 01:19:43,175
When they attack our cities,
we will flatten theirs.

885
01:19:43,217 --> 01:19:47,560
Then we will obliterate them!

886
01:19:55,058 --> 01:19:59,816
The hour will come
when one of us must crack.

887
01:19:59,859 --> 01:20:04,169
It will never be
National Socialist Germany!

888
01:20:06,259 --> 01:20:08,463
Never! Never!

889
01:20:12,596 --> 01:20:15,182
The English are wondering.

890
01:20:15,220 --> 01:20:19,279
They keep asking,
"Why doesn't he come?"

891
01:20:19,317 --> 01:20:22,700
Be patient. Patience.

892
01:20:22,741 --> 01:20:24,399
We are coming.

893
01:20:24,437 --> 01:20:26,804
We are coming!

894
01:20:29,685 --> 01:20:31,474
Sieg heil! Sieg heil!

895
01:20:45,815 --> 01:20:47,092
Attention!

896
01:21:30,972 --> 01:21:32,882
Reichsmarschall, I welcome you
in the name of...

897
01:21:32,924 --> 01:21:36,241
It's all right, Kesselring.
Thank you, thank you.

898
01:21:36,284 --> 01:21:38,935
Ah, Osterkamp,
everything all right?

899
01:21:38,972 --> 01:21:40,282
Yes, sir.

900
01:21:40,317 --> 01:21:42,489
Then it can begin.

901
01:21:43,805 --> 01:21:46,042
- Come with me, Kesselring.
- Yes.

902
01:21:51,934 --> 01:21:54,236
Don't stand around
like a bunch of pigs!

903
01:21:54,270 --> 01:21:55,797
Fall in!

904
01:21:55,838 --> 01:21:59,155
I'll let the lot of you
swim over the Channel!

905
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:00,541
Attention!

906
01:22:05,119 --> 01:22:08,316
In the ditch! March!
Get off the road!

907
01:22:11,136 --> 01:22:13,046
Attention!

908
01:22:48,291 --> 01:22:50,364
There they come.

909
01:23:19,079 --> 01:23:22,178
If we lose the war now...

910
01:23:22,215 --> 01:23:24,768
they'll tear our arses asunder.

911
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:29,989
Arrow to Rabbit Leader.

912
01:23:30,024 --> 01:23:31,879
Vector 1-6-0.

913
01:23:31,912 --> 01:23:33,374
Bandits one hundred plus.

914
01:23:33,416 --> 01:23:34,692
Angels 1-5.

915
01:23:34,728 --> 01:23:37,249
Bandits one hundred plus. Over.

916
01:23:39,497 --> 01:23:40,904
Rabbit to Arrow.

917
01:23:40,937 --> 01:23:42,694
I can't see them.

918
01:23:42,729 --> 01:23:45,282
But they must be there.

919
01:23:45,322 --> 01:23:47,940
Well, come have a look
for yourself then.

920
01:23:47,977 --> 01:23:50,498
Nothing, I repeat, nothing.

921
01:23:50,538 --> 01:23:52,164
Group, please.

922
01:23:59,434 --> 01:24:01,540
Everything we've got,
and get them moving.

923
01:24:01,579 --> 01:24:03,783
They've caught us this time.

924
01:24:03,820 --> 01:24:05,925
They're turning northwest.
It looks like London.

925
01:24:05,963 --> 01:24:07,108
It's London, all right...

926
01:24:07,148 --> 01:24:09,537
and we've got everything up
covering airfields.

927
01:24:20,781 --> 01:24:23,018
Where is the Royal Air Force?

928
01:25:06,034 --> 01:25:07,758
- Messerschmidt.
- Iron Corps.

929
01:25:07,794 --> 01:25:08,907
Messerschmidt!

930
01:25:08,946 --> 01:25:10,856
No, they ain't.
They're Iron Corps.

931
01:25:21,651 --> 01:25:23,244
Five seconds.

932
01:25:28,468 --> 01:25:29,712
Away!

933
01:25:37,813 --> 01:25:38,893
Away!

934
01:26:56,637 --> 01:26:58,547
The pressure's dropping again.

935
01:27:32,065 --> 01:27:35,414
This is as far
as I can get, lad.

936
01:27:49,347 --> 01:27:52,478
Down at the end there,
by that car.

937
01:28:09,060 --> 01:28:11,482
- Hey, no you don't.
- What do you mean?

938
01:28:11,525 --> 01:28:12,954
There's a thousand-pounder
down there...

939
01:28:12,997 --> 01:28:14,372
and it's not gone off.

940
01:28:14,405 --> 01:28:15,682
If you're looking
for somebody...

941
01:28:15,717 --> 01:28:17,473
they're all down
at the church hall.

942
01:28:28,166 --> 01:28:29,922
They got the Rose 'n' Crown.

943
01:28:35,367 --> 01:28:37,669
He'll have to drink
at the Red Lion now.

944
01:28:37,704 --> 01:28:38,849
If they'll have him.

945
01:28:46,728 --> 01:28:48,583
How bloody stupid can you get?

946
01:28:48,617 --> 01:28:50,592
I spend half a leaf seeing you
all safe in the country...

947
01:28:50,633 --> 01:28:51,877
and you bring her back
to all this.

948
01:28:51,912 --> 01:28:53,156
I'm sorry, it's just
we missed everyone.

949
01:28:53,193 --> 01:28:54,687
You're all going back.

950
01:28:54,729 --> 01:28:56,158
Dad, have you finished it?

951
01:28:56,202 --> 01:28:57,631
Have you got it?

952
01:29:09,739 --> 01:29:10,884
Thank you.

953
01:29:16,364 --> 01:29:18,753
There's a family
trapped in Shaw Street.

954
01:29:20,523 --> 01:29:22,433
Can we have
some more volunteers?

955
01:29:35,789 --> 01:29:37,251
I'll be back, luv.

956
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:04,015
Stop that bloody bell!

957
01:30:13,649 --> 01:30:16,202
It came more from the back.

958
01:30:38,772 --> 01:30:41,139
Not real Spitfires.

959
01:30:41,172 --> 01:30:43,027
They couldn't land here.

960
01:30:43,060 --> 01:30:44,948
You'll see in a minute.

961
01:30:44,980 --> 01:30:47,883
Only officers fly Spitfires.

962
01:30:47,925 --> 01:30:50,347
You're not a fighter pilot.

963
01:30:50,389 --> 01:30:52,528
What about your top button?

964
01:30:55,350 --> 01:30:57,805
Anybody can do that.

965
01:33:14,019 --> 01:33:15,994
T-5? What's that?

966
01:33:17,316 --> 01:33:19,225
They're a training
squadron, sir.

967
01:33:19,268 --> 01:33:21,156
The Poles.

968
01:33:21,189 --> 01:33:24,801
Get them out of it.
Get them down.

969
01:33:24,836 --> 01:33:28,415
Blackhawk Leader,
vector 2-3-0...

970
01:33:28,453 --> 01:33:31,170
and return to base
immediately. Over.

971
01:33:31,205 --> 01:33:34,402
Blackhawk Leader.
Received and understood. Out.

972
01:33:34,437 --> 01:33:37,405
Blackhawk Leader to "A" flight.

973
01:33:37,446 --> 01:33:43,163
Turn to port and steer 2-3-0.

974
01:33:43,207 --> 01:33:45,345
Germans! Germans, on the right!

975
01:33:45,383 --> 01:33:48,285
- I don't see! Where?
- Down there on the right!

976
01:33:48,327 --> 01:33:49,921
I see the Jerries. I see!

977
01:33:49,959 --> 01:33:56,605
Stop that Polish chatter
and steer 2-3-0.

978
01:33:56,648 --> 01:33:57,761
Repeat, please.

979
01:33:57,800 --> 01:34:01,183
I say again, 2-3-0.

980
01:34:01,224 --> 01:34:02,817
Repeat, please.

981
01:34:02,856 --> 01:34:07,843
For crying out loud, 2-3-0!

982
01:34:07,881 --> 01:34:10,337
- Repeat, please.
- Repeat, please.

983
01:34:10,377 --> 01:34:13,639
Now, just shut up,
the lot of you, and follow me...

984
01:34:13,674 --> 01:34:15,910
unless you're blind
as well as...

985
01:34:17,322 --> 01:34:19,264
Oh, God's truth.

986
01:34:37,517 --> 01:34:38,924
Shut up!

987
01:34:38,957 --> 01:34:41,258
Silence, in Polish!

988
01:34:59,791 --> 01:35:02,508
Get out quickly!

989
01:35:07,759 --> 01:35:10,891
One, the R.A.F.
Is not a flying circus.

990
01:35:13,936 --> 01:35:18,476
Two, strict R.T. Procedure
will be observed at all times.

991
01:35:23,858 --> 01:35:27,655
And it is never... repeat,
never... to be used...

992
01:35:31,826 --> 01:35:35,950
for private Polish chitchat.

993
01:35:38,963 --> 01:35:42,379
Finally, and God alone
knows why...

994
01:35:42,419 --> 01:35:44,361
I've received
the following signal.

995
01:35:46,099 --> 01:35:50,322
"Congratulations. As of today,
this squadron is operational."

996
01:35:50,356 --> 01:35:51,468
Signed, "Keith Park...

997
01:35:51,508 --> 01:35:53,166
"Air Vice Marshal,
A.O.C. 11 Group."

998
01:35:57,620 --> 01:35:59,857
I was wrong about the Poles.

999
01:35:59,893 --> 01:36:02,576
We also have the second
Polish squadron, sir.

1000
01:36:02,614 --> 01:36:04,272
I thought you'd mention that.

1001
01:36:04,309 --> 01:36:06,448
All right.
Make them operational.

1002
01:36:06,486 --> 01:36:08,341
And the Canadians?

1003
01:36:08,374 --> 01:36:11,244
And the Czechs.
We need them all.

1004
01:36:22,711 --> 01:36:24,599
Looks like London again, sir.

1005
01:36:24,632 --> 01:36:25,842
Yes.

1006
01:36:28,792 --> 01:36:31,727
And there's nothing
we can do about it.

1007
01:36:31,769 --> 01:36:35,381
But if Goering
should concentrate...

1008
01:36:35,416 --> 01:36:38,646
on London by day...

1009
01:36:38,681 --> 01:36:40,470
it's another matter.

1010
01:36:40,505 --> 01:36:43,255
If it means he leaves
my airfields alone...

1011
01:36:43,290 --> 01:36:45,362
I shan't complain.

1012
01:36:45,402 --> 01:36:47,289
Even a few days would
give me the chance...

1013
01:36:47,322 --> 01:36:48,882
to get back to full strength.

1014
01:36:48,922 --> 01:36:51,573
He'll have farther to come.

1015
01:36:51,610 --> 01:36:52,919
And to go back.

1016
01:36:52,954 --> 01:36:55,256
We'll have more time
to intercept.

1017
01:36:55,290 --> 01:36:59,252
What's more important, Park...

1018
01:36:59,291 --> 01:37:01,560
his fighters
have only fuel enough...

1019
01:37:01,595 --> 01:37:04,443
for ten minutes over London.

1020
01:37:04,475 --> 01:37:07,126
His bombers will lose much
of their protection.

1021
01:37:07,164 --> 01:37:09,684
For the first time...

1022
01:37:09,725 --> 01:37:14,133
they'll all come within
the range of 12 Group.

1023
01:37:15,933 --> 01:37:18,781
Perhaps now,
at last, we shall see...

1024
01:37:18,813 --> 01:37:21,912
what Leigh-Mallory's
Big Wings are made of.

1025
01:37:25,053 --> 01:37:30,040
Turning on London could be
the Germans' biggest blunder.

1026
01:37:34,559 --> 01:37:37,177
Spider Leader,
this is Top Hat Control.

1027
01:37:37,215 --> 01:37:40,663
Bandits now twenty miles
east of you, heading southeast.

1028
01:37:40,703 --> 01:37:42,612
Vector 1-2-0.

1029
01:37:42,656 --> 01:37:45,111
- Make, Angel 2-0.
- Roger, Top Hat.

1030
01:37:45,151 --> 01:37:48,534
Fox Trot Leader,
this is Tango Control.

1031
01:37:48,576 --> 01:37:51,130
Fox Trot Leader,
Pass your message.

1032
01:37:51,168 --> 01:37:54,649
I have some trade for you
building up over green "A."

1033
01:37:54,689 --> 01:37:56,696
Roger, Tango.

1034
01:37:59,841 --> 01:38:02,460
Spider Leader, Top Hat Control.

1035
01:38:02,497 --> 01:38:05,116
Your customers appear
to be splitting up.

1036
01:38:05,154 --> 01:38:08,318
Main course heading for London
will be your target.

1037
01:38:08,354 --> 01:38:11,518
Vector 0-9-0.

1038
01:38:11,554 --> 01:38:13,856
Roger, Top Hat.

1039
01:38:17,635 --> 01:38:22,655
Batman Control.
Climb to Angels 1-9.

1040
01:38:22,692 --> 01:38:24,186
Roger, Batman.

1041
01:38:31,908 --> 01:38:33,218
Thank you again.

1042
01:38:34,597 --> 01:38:37,412
This should give them
something to think about.

1043
01:38:39,781 --> 01:38:42,236
Starlight Control to Dogtail.

1044
01:38:42,278 --> 01:38:44,187
Keep an eye out
for a friendly wing...

1045
01:38:44,229 --> 01:38:46,139
joining you on your port side.

1046
01:38:46,182 --> 01:38:48,571
Roger, Starlight.

1047
01:38:48,615 --> 01:38:51,070
I see them. I see them.

1048
01:38:51,110 --> 01:38:52,769
Bloody marvelous.

1049
01:38:52,807 --> 01:38:55,109
Fox Trot Leader, Tango Control.

1050
01:38:55,143 --> 01:38:58,143
Bandits now probably
slightly below you.

1051
01:38:58,183 --> 01:39:00,093
Roger, Tango. I've got them.

1052
01:39:04,264 --> 01:39:07,264
Peewee Leader
turning starboard now.

1053
01:39:09,288 --> 01:39:11,525
Watch out for 109s about.

1054
01:39:11,560 --> 01:39:14,495
Roger, Fairfield Leader.
Going up now.

1055
01:39:14,537 --> 01:39:16,807
Take the left-hand pair,
Blue Leader.

1056
01:39:16,841 --> 01:39:17,954
Roger.

1057
01:39:17,993 --> 01:39:19,717
Everybody else, keep tight.

1058
01:39:25,706 --> 01:39:27,332
Swarms of them, sir!

1059
01:39:27,371 --> 01:39:29,280
Fox Trot Leader, cut that out.

1060
01:39:29,322 --> 01:39:30,981
Everyone keep quiet.

1061
01:40:11,663 --> 01:40:13,518
Leave the flaming fighters.

1062
01:40:13,551 --> 01:40:15,624
It's the bloody bombers
we want.

1063
01:40:31,697 --> 01:40:34,348
Ox, will you pipe down?

1064
01:40:34,385 --> 01:40:36,774
On fire, son of a gun!

1065
01:40:46,899 --> 01:40:49,233
Ox! Behind you!

1066
01:40:49,267 --> 01:40:50,511
Behind!

1067
01:40:56,819 --> 01:41:00,976
I am on fire! I'm bailing out!

1068
01:41:53,689 --> 01:41:55,511
Good afternoon.

1069
01:41:55,545 --> 01:42:00,368
Good afternoon my ass,
you Boche bastard.

1070
01:42:00,410 --> 01:42:02,319
Put your hands up!
Come on, put them up!

1071
01:42:02,362 --> 01:42:03,671
What is it?
I'm a Polish pilot...

1072
01:42:03,706 --> 01:42:05,016
Cor blimey.
Your mitts, mate... your mitts.

1073
01:42:05,050 --> 01:42:06,741
Put 'em up there.
Go on. Get going.

1074
01:42:06,778 --> 01:42:11,601
Where are you taking me?
I'm fighting on your side!

1075
01:43:18,434 --> 01:43:19,896
Can we get in?

1076
01:43:19,938 --> 01:43:22,272
- And fetch the doctor.
- Good.

1077
01:43:23,555 --> 01:43:25,595
I know, young man.

1078
01:43:27,554 --> 01:43:29,627
Get out of the way, man.

1079
01:43:35,939 --> 01:43:38,078
It's coming. It's coming.

1080
01:43:42,916 --> 01:43:46,528
Are you telling me
that your losses are critical?

1081
01:43:46,564 --> 01:43:48,834
We're bombing day and night,
Reichsmarschall.

1082
01:43:48,869 --> 01:43:51,619
Our losses are high,
and our pilots are tired...

1083
01:43:51,654 --> 01:43:52,963
and the planes need servicing.

1084
01:43:52,997 --> 01:43:56,642
Be specific!
What are you telling me?!

1085
01:43:56,678 --> 01:43:59,777
The English
have changed tactics.

1086
01:43:59,814 --> 01:44:02,564
Changed tactics? How?

1087
01:44:02,598 --> 01:44:05,468
They are attacking
in large numbers.

1088
01:44:05,510 --> 01:44:08,031
Our losses might be reduced
if our formations...

1089
01:44:08,071 --> 01:44:11,420
were more closely escorted
by fighters, sir.

1090
01:44:11,463 --> 01:44:13,318
The fighters are always there.

1091
01:44:13,351 --> 01:44:16,134
But not close enough,
is that it?

1092
01:44:16,167 --> 01:44:17,956
You, yourself,
were a fighter pilot.

1093
01:44:17,992 --> 01:44:20,381
The fighter is a hunter, sir.

1094
01:44:20,424 --> 01:44:22,017
I was a fighter pilot.

1095
01:44:23,689 --> 01:44:25,347
I was not a coward!

1096
01:44:25,385 --> 01:44:27,840
There is no suggestion
of cowardice, sir!

1097
01:44:27,881 --> 01:44:29,791
I am making the suggestion!

1098
01:44:32,426 --> 01:44:37,282
From now on the fighters will
stay close with our bombers.

1099
01:44:37,322 --> 01:44:38,948
And lose their
natural advantages...

1100
01:44:38,986 --> 01:44:41,921
of surprise and speed?

1101
01:44:41,962 --> 01:44:44,712
You will obey orders!

1102
01:44:44,747 --> 01:44:49,286
The invasion cannot begin
until we have cleared the skies.

1103
01:44:51,628 --> 01:44:55,141
Come, my friends,
I have chastised you enough.

1104
01:44:55,179 --> 01:44:57,929
But I am here to help him.

1105
01:44:57,964 --> 01:45:00,615
Is there anything you want?

1106
01:45:00,652 --> 01:45:02,757
Foehn? Falke?

1107
01:45:02,797 --> 01:45:05,164
Yes, sir,
a squadron of Spitfires.

1108
01:45:25,839 --> 01:45:27,628
Stop... vapor trail.

1109
01:45:27,663 --> 01:45:29,452
Left and above.

1110
01:45:29,487 --> 01:45:31,462
Vulture Leader to everyone.

1111
01:45:31,504 --> 01:45:33,708
Keep quiet. Hold positions.

1112
01:45:39,664 --> 01:45:41,704
We'll encircle them
only when they close up...

1113
01:45:41,745 --> 01:45:43,174
to firing distance.

1114
01:45:59,666 --> 01:46:01,390
We'll take the rear starboard.

1115
01:46:01,426 --> 01:46:03,084
Yellow, you take the port.

1116
01:46:03,123 --> 01:46:05,065
Roger.

1117
01:47:46,429 --> 01:47:49,112
Thanks awfully, old chap.

1118
01:47:51,070 --> 01:47:52,892
Sir, you know...

1119
01:47:52,926 --> 01:47:55,544
I have promised the Fuehrer...

1120
01:47:55,582 --> 01:48:00,284
to clear the skies
and totally destroy the R.A.F.

1121
01:48:03,039 --> 01:48:05,406
I expect to be obeyed!

1122
01:48:13,311 --> 01:48:14,719
Here we are.

1123
01:48:14,752 --> 01:48:17,600
The miracle of the loaves.

1124
01:48:17,632 --> 01:48:20,600
We should have moved in here
before we were bombed.

1125
01:48:20,640 --> 01:48:25,943
Maggie, I'd like you to meet
our new assistant controller.

1126
01:48:25,986 --> 01:48:30,721
Squadron Leader Tom Evans,
Section Officer Harvey.

1127
01:48:32,194 --> 01:48:33,568
How do you do?

1128
01:48:33,602 --> 01:48:35,326
Hello.

1129
01:48:35,362 --> 01:48:37,467
He knows your old man.

1130
01:48:38,819 --> 01:48:40,510
How is Colin?

1131
01:48:40,546 --> 01:48:43,165
Haven't seen him
since my little escapade...

1132
01:48:43,203 --> 01:48:44,610
with the burning Hurricane.

1133
01:48:44,643 --> 01:48:46,104
Excuse me, ma'am.

1134
01:48:46,148 --> 01:48:49,181
Ma'am. There's a call for you.

1135
01:48:49,220 --> 01:48:51,838
Will you excuse me
just a minute?

1136
01:48:51,876 --> 01:48:54,396
- Yes.
- Thanks.

1137
01:48:54,436 --> 01:48:55,898
It's around the corner.

1138
01:48:59,812 --> 01:49:00,925
Hello?

1139
01:49:00,964 --> 01:49:02,907
It's me.

1140
01:49:02,949 --> 01:49:05,283
How on earth did you
get through here?

1141
01:49:05,317 --> 01:49:06,779
Put it down to rank.

1142
01:49:06,821 --> 01:49:09,090
I said I was an old battle-ax
from the Air Ministry.

1143
01:49:09,126 --> 01:49:12,192
Colin. That was very clever.

1144
01:49:12,229 --> 01:49:13,920
Any news?

1145
01:49:13,958 --> 01:49:15,584
About?

1146
01:49:15,622 --> 01:49:18,404
Your posting, you silly idiot.

1147
01:49:21,415 --> 01:49:22,822
Well, you've applied.

1148
01:49:22,855 --> 01:49:24,742
I've been so busy here.

1149
01:49:24,775 --> 01:49:26,663
It's really not as simple
as all that.

1150
01:49:26,695 --> 01:49:28,190
Look, why the hell not?

1151
01:49:28,232 --> 01:49:30,174
To be absolutely honest,
I forgot.

1152
01:49:30,215 --> 01:49:31,939
I know, darling. I'm sorry.

1153
01:49:31,976 --> 01:49:33,220
Groopy's here now.

1154
01:49:33,256 --> 01:49:35,711
I'll go and talk to him
right away. All right?

1155
01:49:35,752 --> 01:49:38,273
All right?

1156
01:49:38,312 --> 01:49:39,654
Colin?

1157
01:49:42,537 --> 01:49:43,682
Colin?

1158
01:49:45,833 --> 01:49:48,615
Get through all right, sir?

1159
01:49:48,650 --> 01:49:49,795
Yes.

1160
01:49:51,114 --> 01:49:53,001
Let me give you
a piece of advice.

1161
01:49:53,034 --> 01:49:55,009
What's that, sir?

1162
01:49:55,050 --> 01:49:56,457
Stay single.

1163
01:50:12,908 --> 01:50:15,909
Are you still with me,
Dogtail Red-2?

1164
01:50:15,948 --> 01:50:17,377
Affirmative, Red Leader.

1165
01:50:17,420 --> 01:50:19,690
Directly behind you
and on your starboard side.

1166
01:51:25,331 --> 01:51:27,950
What happened to Harvey?

1167
01:51:27,988 --> 01:51:30,159
He got a 1-0-9,
then ran into trouble...

1168
01:51:30,196 --> 01:51:31,406
but he's all right.

1169
01:51:31,444 --> 01:51:33,964
No mistake.
I saw him bail out.

1170
01:51:34,932 --> 01:51:37,966
Right, right, attention.

1171
01:51:39,189 --> 01:51:41,971
Right. Stand at ease.

1172
01:51:42,005 --> 01:51:45,202
Corporal Seymour will detail
you to your various watches.

1173
01:51:47,061 --> 01:51:48,785
I left out the bit
about the wolf whistles.

1174
01:51:48,822 --> 01:51:50,000
You're better at that.

1175
01:51:50,038 --> 01:51:51,892
The troops have other things
on their minds nowadays...

1176
01:51:51,926 --> 01:51:53,071
thank goodness.

1177
01:51:53,111 --> 01:51:55,118
Right! Shun!

1178
01:52:03,383 --> 01:52:05,172
It's Colin.

1179
01:52:05,207 --> 01:52:07,957
He isn't dead, Maggie.

1180
01:52:07,992 --> 01:52:09,847
He's going to be all right.

1181
01:52:11,640 --> 01:52:15,154
They can do wonders
nowadays, you know.

1182
01:52:15,193 --> 01:52:18,292
It's just a question
of time, that's all.

1183
01:52:22,233 --> 01:52:24,655
We'll get you a posting
so you can be near him.

1184
01:52:28,634 --> 01:52:30,260
Is he badly burned?

1185
01:52:43,132 --> 01:52:44,920
You sent for me, sir?

1186
01:52:44,956 --> 01:52:47,673
Yes, Peter. I want you
to take over Red Section.

1187
01:52:50,108 --> 01:52:52,312
Who are my numbers
two and three, sir?

1188
01:52:52,348 --> 01:52:55,283
A couple of new lads.
They're outside.

1189
01:53:01,853 --> 01:53:03,893
Right, then.

1190
01:53:03,933 --> 01:53:05,690
How many hours on spits?

1191
01:53:05,726 --> 01:53:07,898
- Ten, sir.
- Seven, sir.

1192
01:53:07,934 --> 01:53:12,539
Stick to me like glue
and keep your eyes open.

1193
01:53:25,216 --> 01:53:29,307
Control. Put out 2-2-2
and 6-0-3 Squadrons...

1194
01:53:29,344 --> 01:53:31,166
against Hostile 2-6.

1195
01:53:31,200 --> 01:53:34,331
Winston would pick
a day like this to come.

1196
01:53:45,666 --> 01:53:47,553
Is everything up?

1197
01:53:47,586 --> 01:53:49,658
The lot, sir.

1198
01:53:49,698 --> 01:53:51,934
- Reserves?
- None.

1199
01:53:53,475 --> 01:53:56,257
That's what I've just told
the prime minister.

1200
01:54:28,422 --> 01:54:30,757
Red-3, this is Red-1.

1201
01:54:30,790 --> 01:54:34,500
Much closer.
I can hardly see you.

1202
01:54:34,535 --> 01:54:38,659
Red-2.
You must keep up with me.

1203
01:54:38,695 --> 01:54:41,794
Right, Red Section. Here we go.

1204
01:54:41,832 --> 01:54:44,199
Stick to me like glue.

1205
01:54:57,545 --> 01:54:59,585
Red-3, behind you!

1206
01:57:21,527 --> 01:57:23,568
Come in, Blue-2.

1207
01:59:36,774 --> 01:59:39,621
Hey, kids. Shut up, will you?

1208
01:59:39,654 --> 01:59:42,175
This is the BBC home service.

1209
01:59:42,214 --> 01:59:44,254
Here is the 9:00 news...

1210
01:59:44,294 --> 01:59:47,611
and this is Armand Adell
reading it.

1211
01:59:47,655 --> 01:59:49,663
Up till 8:00 tonight...

1212
01:59:49,703 --> 01:59:53,052
165 German aircraft
have been destroyed...

1213
01:59:53,095 --> 01:59:56,773
in big scale attacks
attempted by the enemy today...

1214
01:59:56,807 --> 01:59:59,263
on London and the southeast.

1215
01:59:59,304 --> 02:00:03,330
We lost thirty fighters
with ten of the pilots safe.

1216
02:00:05,577 --> 02:00:08,424
Buckingham Palace
has been bombed again...

1217
02:00:08,457 --> 02:00:10,846
but no one was hurt.

1218
02:00:16,458 --> 02:00:19,142
Yes? Yes, one moment.

1219
02:00:19,178 --> 02:00:21,862
It's the air minister, sir,
on the scrambler.

1220
02:00:25,066 --> 02:00:26,179
Yes?

1221
02:00:26,218 --> 02:00:30,081
Dowding. Look,
our people in Washington...

1222
02:00:30,123 --> 02:00:32,360
are having trouble
with the American press...

1223
02:00:32,395 --> 02:00:34,730
and it's about today's figures.

1224
02:00:34,763 --> 02:00:36,651
German sources there
are saying...

1225
02:00:36,683 --> 02:00:40,296
that our claims
are wildly exaggerated.

1226
02:00:43,181 --> 02:00:45,003
Hello?

1227
02:00:45,037 --> 02:00:46,378
Are you there, Dowding?

1228
02:00:46,413 --> 02:00:48,388
I'm here, Minister.

1229
02:00:48,429 --> 02:00:50,502
Well, can you verify
the figures?

1230
02:00:52,397 --> 02:00:55,812
I'm not very interested
in propaganda.

1231
02:00:55,854 --> 02:00:58,953
If we're right,
they'll give up.

1232
02:00:58,990 --> 02:01:02,220
If we're wrong, they'll be
in London in a week.

1233
02:01:32,402 --> 02:01:35,249
- Morning, Arnold.
- Morning, sir.

1234
02:01:35,282 --> 02:01:36,711
Morning, sir.

1235
02:01:38,162 --> 02:01:40,268
- Morning, Arnold.
- Morning, Clyde.

1236
02:01:51,604 --> 02:01:53,098
Dispersal.

1237
02:01:56,436 --> 02:01:58,378
Right.

1238
02:01:58,420 --> 02:02:00,079
Tea's up.

1239
02:03:39,454 --> 02:03:40,948
Good morning, sir.

1240
02:03:40,991 --> 02:03:43,063
Good morning.

1241
02:03:43,103 --> 02:03:45,045
They are late
this morning, sir.

1242
02:03:47,519 --> 02:03:50,586
The bastards
are up to something.

1243
02:03:56,128 --> 02:03:59,838
Quick march!

1244
02:04:11,682 --> 02:04:15,261
You have let me down!

1245
02:04:15,298 --> 02:04:17,720
You have betrayed me!
