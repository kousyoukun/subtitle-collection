1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,691
Begin. This is off speed.

2
00:00:02,727 --> 00:00:04,996
Check 5-0-1 back
at ready desk...

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,927
I think you ought
to see this, sir.

4
00:00:17,321 --> 00:00:18,498
Thank you.

5
00:00:30,984 --> 00:00:32,894
Air raid warning.

6
00:00:32,937 --> 00:00:35,272
Sector Three Red.

7
00:00:57,097 --> 00:00:59,366
Rabbit Squadron.

8
00:00:59,402 --> 00:01:01,922
Tallyho, tallyho, Red Section.

9
00:01:01,962 --> 00:01:03,969
We'll take the rear starboard.

10
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:06,017
Yellow, you take the port.

11
00:01:06,058 --> 00:01:08,197
Yellow-1 Wilco.

12
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:10,023
Tallyho, Yellow.

13
00:01:13,226 --> 00:01:16,422
Amaliel, keep your eyes open
for the Red Squad.

14
00:02:04,044 --> 00:02:06,149
Rabbit Leader, Red-3,
you're on those bastards...

15
00:02:06,188 --> 00:02:08,260
Six o'clock high.
Coming down now.

16
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,187
Roger, Red-3. I see them.

17
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,911
Rabbit, brave right and climb.

18
00:03:05,614 --> 00:03:08,167
Behind you, Andy! On your tail!

19
00:03:22,255 --> 00:03:24,557
Get out, Andy!

20
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,867
Jump!

21
00:03:36,367 --> 00:03:38,276
Hurry up! Out!

22
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,880
All out!

23
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,077
Don't any of you Joes
talk English?

24
00:04:24,112 --> 00:04:25,323
Corporal!

25
00:04:26,448 --> 00:04:27,561
Sir!

26
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,022
Where are you taking
those vultures?

27
00:04:30,065 --> 00:04:32,749
Officers to the mess,
ensigns to the guard room, sir.

28
00:04:32,785 --> 00:04:35,087
Like hell you are. They're
responsible for all that.

29
00:04:35,121 --> 00:04:37,936
- Get them to clear it up.
- But what about the officers?

30
00:04:37,969 --> 00:04:39,594
Give them a bloody shovel.

31
00:04:39,633 --> 00:04:41,608
Come on, step with it!

32
00:04:42,577 --> 00:04:44,487
Skipper hates Jerries.

33
00:04:44,529 --> 00:04:47,082
He'll hate me if you don't
get that gun repaired.

34
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:49,293
Then wrap up this little lot.

35
00:04:55,314 --> 00:04:57,223
Only eight for the morning?

36
00:04:57,265 --> 00:04:59,054
Got to do better than that.

37
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,551
Five are write-offs.

38
00:05:00,593 --> 00:05:03,660
One has another guard gone,
and two are missing, sir.

39
00:05:03,698 --> 00:05:06,065
Mr. Anthony and Sergeant Moore.

40
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:08,847
And these two
are hundred-hour checks.

41
00:05:12,307 --> 00:05:14,478
They've been at it
for 48 hours solid, sir.

42
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:15,659
I know.

43
00:05:17,203 --> 00:05:19,275
Where the hell have you been?!

44
00:05:20,243 --> 00:05:21,650
Learning to swim.

45
00:05:21,682 --> 00:05:24,104
- Do your best, Blaine.
- Roger.

46
00:05:26,418 --> 00:05:27,847
You get one?

47
00:05:27,891 --> 00:05:30,444
All I got was a bellyful
of English Channel.

48
00:05:30,483 --> 00:05:32,392
When are you going to learn?

49
00:05:33,619 --> 00:05:34,993
I didn't know they were there.

50
00:05:35,027 --> 00:05:36,434
Never fly straight and level...

51
00:05:36,467 --> 00:05:38,768
for more than thirty seconds
in the combat area.

52
00:05:38,803 --> 00:05:41,836
How many times have I told you?
Come on, I'll give you a lift.

53
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,730
I'd rather walk, sir.

54
00:05:43,763 --> 00:05:46,513
Cut out the "sir."

55
00:05:50,196 --> 00:05:51,603
You called your wife?

56
00:05:55,348 --> 00:05:57,388
All right, boy. Get in.

57
00:06:16,788 --> 00:06:18,195
Here you are, sir.

58
00:06:18,228 --> 00:06:19,472
Thank you.

59
00:06:22,933 --> 00:06:24,493
It's ridiculous!

60
00:06:24,532 --> 00:06:26,355
We go up four
or five times a day...

61
00:06:26,388 --> 00:06:28,276
and every time we come down,
more potholes.

62
00:06:28,308 --> 00:06:31,123
There are more potholes until we
can't bloody well get in a door.

63
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:32,466
We'll get this place
operational again.

64
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,027
You won't. Not until
someone decides...

65
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:36,076
to protect it while we're up.

66
00:06:39,445 --> 00:06:41,485
What flaming genius
thought of sending us...

67
00:06:41,525 --> 00:06:43,020
to that dump of a flying club?

68
00:06:43,061 --> 00:06:45,166
Don't blame me.
Direct orders from group.

69
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:47,758
Park himself.
It's not a bad little field.

70
00:06:47,798 --> 00:06:49,139
I've seen it. Damp tents...

71
00:06:49,174 --> 00:06:51,443
and a nasty little shack
full of dead flies.

72
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:53,365
At least you won't have
the Jerries visiting you.

73
00:06:53,398 --> 00:06:55,438
I don't blame them.

74
00:07:17,078 --> 00:07:19,467
How much longer, Hobbes?

75
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:22,642
The engine's overheating,
and so am I.

76
00:07:22,678 --> 00:07:24,533
We either stand down
or blow up.

77
00:07:24,567 --> 00:07:25,712
Which do you want?

78
00:07:59,032 --> 00:08:00,919
Hostile 1-6, reconfirm, please.

79
00:08:00,952 --> 00:08:04,432
Need some more
Yellow sevens, Flight.

80
00:08:04,472 --> 00:08:07,952
This is R-29,
now forty plus. 1-5.

81
00:08:10,552 --> 00:08:13,454
Yes. 2-6 and 4-1 detected, sir.

82
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,531
7 Squadron's airborne, sir.

83
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:19,416
Thank you. Let 12 Group know.
And make sure they know...

84
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:21,074
they're protecting
my airfields while they're up.

85
00:08:21,113 --> 00:08:23,666
- They have been told, sir.
- Tell them again.

86
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,791
Pine Tree Leader,
this is Turkey Control.

87
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:30,484
Vector 1-9-2.

88
00:08:30,521 --> 00:08:32,758
I have some trade for you
over Maidstone.

89
00:08:32,793 --> 00:08:36,142
Turkey Control,
Pine Tree Leader.

90
00:08:36,185 --> 00:08:39,055
Roger 1-9-0.

91
00:08:39,097 --> 00:08:41,399
Pine Tree, this is Turkey.

92
00:08:41,433 --> 00:08:46,168
Twenty plus bandits
and Angels 2-0 heading west.

93
00:08:46,201 --> 00:08:48,535
Roger, Turkey Control.

94
00:08:58,522 --> 00:09:01,206
Indiana left.
Making low level attack.

95
00:09:01,242 --> 00:09:04,755
Roger. I see you.
I'm breaking left to attack.

96
00:09:20,251 --> 00:09:23,285
My God!
Fighters coming down now!

97
00:09:23,323 --> 00:09:25,941
Fire speed. Break.

98
00:09:25,979 --> 00:09:27,124
Break!

99
00:09:46,172 --> 00:09:48,758
On your tail, Jamie.

100
00:10:35,517 --> 00:10:37,372
Enemy aircraft
approaching, sir.

101
00:10:37,406 --> 00:10:41,530
Coming straight for us.
Flying course, 21st.

102
00:10:41,565 --> 00:10:43,638
About eight thousand feet.

103
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:45,499
I'm taking cover.

104
00:10:45,534 --> 00:10:47,061
Tin hats, everybody.

105
00:11:07,486 --> 00:11:10,268
That should damn well
never have happened.

106
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:12,823
- Where the hell is 12 Group?
- They were requested, sir.

107
00:11:12,863 --> 00:11:15,197
They're nowhere in sight.

108
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,718
Find out what the devil
they think they're playing at.

109
00:11:48,448 --> 00:11:50,968
They just fell on us.

110
00:11:51,008 --> 00:11:53,691
They got my number two
and the C.O.

111
00:11:53,728 --> 00:11:56,149
You saw Canfield go down?

112
00:11:56,192 --> 00:11:57,850
It blew up.

113
00:11:57,888 --> 00:11:59,677
Just blew up.

114
00:12:17,089 --> 00:12:18,780
- Bad as we thought?
- Worse.

115
00:12:18,817 --> 00:12:20,377
Kenley and Biggenor
are shambles again...

116
00:12:20,417 --> 00:12:21,661
and the rest
are not much better.

117
00:12:21,697 --> 00:12:24,545
God knows how many aircraft
we'll have in the morning.

118
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,268
All because 12 Group
didn't do their stuff.

119
00:12:26,305 --> 00:12:28,541
Leigh-Mallory
and his so-called Big Wings.

120
00:12:28,577 --> 00:12:31,446
Might as well stay on the ground
for all the use they are.

121
00:12:31,489 --> 00:12:32,918
We were up, sir.

122
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:35,711
Trying to knock out
the enemy en masse.

123
00:12:36,705 --> 00:12:39,422
But it takes time to assemble 40
or 50 aircraft at 15,000 feet.

124
00:12:39,456 --> 00:12:41,245
It takes far too long.

125
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,939
By the time
your Big Wing is up...

126
00:12:42,976 --> 00:12:46,238
the enemy have hit their targets
and are on their way home.

127
00:12:46,272 --> 00:12:50,102
All that matters is to shoot
them down in large numbers.

128
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:52,993
I'd rather destroy fifty after
they've hit their targets...

129
00:12:53,025 --> 00:12:54,302
than ten before.

130
00:12:54,337 --> 00:12:57,501
Don't forget the targets are
my airfields, Leigh-Mallory...

131
00:12:57,537 --> 00:13:00,384
and you're not getting fifty.
You're not even getting ten.

132
00:13:00,417 --> 00:13:04,792
Gentlemen, you're missing
the essential truth.

133
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:07,736
We're short
of two hundred pilots.

134
00:13:07,778 --> 00:13:10,844
Those we have are tired,
strained...

135
00:13:10,881 --> 00:13:13,500
and all overdue for relief.

136
00:13:15,681 --> 00:13:18,616
We're fighting for survival.

137
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:21,184
Losing.

138
00:13:25,122 --> 00:13:28,919
We don't need a big wing
or a small wing.

139
00:13:28,962 --> 00:13:30,936
We need pilots.

140
00:13:37,058 --> 00:13:39,579
And a miracle.

141
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:41,625
Good night, gentlemen.

142
00:13:44,355 --> 00:13:46,264
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, sir.

143
00:13:51,042 --> 00:13:54,010
And now, over to
the Savoy Hotel, London...

144
00:13:54,051 --> 00:13:55,939
for dance music
until midnight...

145
00:13:55,971 --> 00:13:59,168
with Carrol Gibbons
and his Savoy Hotel Orpheans.

146
00:14:17,028 --> 00:14:19,897
You look a damn sight better
out of uniform.

147
00:14:19,939 --> 00:14:22,460
Hardly remember you
out of yours.

148
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,442
And who's fault's that?

149
00:14:24,483 --> 00:14:26,753
For God's sake, not again.

150
00:14:26,788 --> 00:14:29,057
Look, damn it,
my squadron's come south.

151
00:14:29,092 --> 00:14:30,521
You just apply
for that posting!

152
00:14:30,564 --> 00:14:32,506
Colin, no!

153
00:14:32,548 --> 00:14:35,167
All right, agreed!
Taboo subject tonight.

154
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:39,810
Old wafs.

155
00:14:58,405 --> 00:15:01,853
You really think
we're solemnly going...

156
00:15:01,893 --> 00:15:04,414
to get into these
ridiculous garments?

157
00:15:04,453 --> 00:15:06,787
Not at this stage, surely.

158
00:15:08,421 --> 00:15:10,527
I'm shy.

159
00:15:10,565 --> 00:15:11,972
Oh, Maggie, come on.

160
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:16,609
It's just...

161
00:15:16,646 --> 00:15:19,646
I am shy.

162
00:15:19,686 --> 00:15:21,028
Honestly.

163
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:29,154
I'll put out the light.

164
00:15:30,726 --> 00:15:32,449
No, Colin!

165
00:15:32,487 --> 00:15:35,007
No, it's not just bed, it's us!

166
00:15:35,046 --> 00:15:36,541
It's you.

167
00:15:38,822 --> 00:15:40,316
And me.

168
00:15:48,807 --> 00:15:50,269
You and me.

169
00:16:30,632 --> 00:16:33,349
We should have been over target
nine minutes ago.

170
00:16:33,384 --> 00:16:35,075
The wind has veered.

171
00:16:35,112 --> 00:16:36,705
So where are we?

172
00:16:46,601 --> 00:16:47,943
Where is London?

173
00:16:47,977 --> 00:16:50,148
Far back in the south-west.

174
00:16:50,185 --> 00:16:53,054
Good. Then get rid of the bombs
and let's go home.

175
00:17:01,418 --> 00:17:02,759
Colin.

176
00:17:05,321 --> 00:17:08,038
I will put in
for that posting.

177
00:17:11,433 --> 00:17:12,644
Promise.

178
00:17:18,761 --> 00:17:20,103
That's their bombs!

179
00:17:21,226 --> 00:17:22,535
They're bombing London!

180
00:17:29,066 --> 00:17:31,106
It isn't funny! Cut it out!

181
00:17:31,146 --> 00:17:32,706
Too damn close.

182
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:44,390
Colin, I promise.

183
00:17:46,155 --> 00:17:47,431
I promise.

184
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:55,745
Attacks on London
are strictly forbidden.

185
00:17:57,771 --> 00:18:00,902
This order you know as well
as I do, Major Brandt.

186
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,882
These attacks
may only be flown...

187
00:18:02,923 --> 00:18:05,160
on the specific order
of the Fuehrer.

188
00:18:06,636 --> 00:18:08,359
I regret, gentlemen...

189
00:18:08,395 --> 00:18:11,298
that this is now
completely out of my hands.

190
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,925
By order
of Vice Marshal Goering...

191
00:18:13,964 --> 00:18:17,346
you two are to report
to Berlin to testify.

192
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:18,981
Thank you.

193
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:41,226
Major Brandt?

194
00:18:41,261 --> 00:18:44,108
Flying Officer Froedl.
Please follow me.

195
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:48,611
Would you believe it?

196
00:18:48,653 --> 00:18:51,020
Don't they know
there's a blackout?

197
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:57,195
You know what Goering said:

198
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:01,834
"If ever a bomb falls
on Berlin...

199
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:04,357
- "you may call me Meier."
- Hmm.

200
00:19:04,398 --> 00:19:08,140
You are to report to Colonel
Schroeder at 9 A.M. Sharp.

201
00:19:08,173 --> 00:19:10,028
This car will take you
to your quarters...

202
00:19:10,062 --> 00:19:12,298
and you are to remain there.

203
00:20:07,823 --> 00:20:10,157
"As from today,
we are called Meier."

204
00:20:12,271 --> 00:20:17,803
Last night, bombs were dropped
on Berlin by the British.

205
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,116
So be it.

206
00:20:19,152 --> 00:20:22,665
That is a game
at which two can play.

207
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:27,815
If the R.A.F. Drops
three, four...

208
00:20:27,856 --> 00:20:30,191
five thousand kilograms of bombs
on Germany in one night...

209
00:20:30,224 --> 00:20:33,607
then in one night we shall drop
three hundred...

210
00:20:33,648 --> 00:20:39,529
four hundred, five hundred,
five thousand on England!

211
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:52,775
When they attack our cities,
we will flatten theirs.

212
00:20:52,817 --> 00:20:57,160
Then we will obliterate them!

213
00:21:04,658 --> 00:21:09,415
The hour will come
when one of us must crack.

214
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:13,768
It will never be
National Socialist Germany!

215
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:18,062
Never! Never!

216
00:21:22,194 --> 00:21:24,780
The English are wondering.

217
00:21:24,818 --> 00:21:28,877
They keep asking,
"Why doesn't he come?"

218
00:21:28,915 --> 00:21:32,297
Be patient. Patience.

219
00:21:32,339 --> 00:21:33,997
We are coming.

220
00:21:34,034 --> 00:21:36,401
We are coming!

221
00:21:39,282 --> 00:21:41,071
Sieg heil! Sieg heil!

222
00:21:55,411 --> 00:21:56,687
Attention!

223
00:22:40,565 --> 00:22:42,475
Reichsmarschall, I welcome you
in the name of...

224
00:22:42,517 --> 00:22:45,833
It's all right, Kesselring.
Thank you, thank you.

225
00:22:45,876 --> 00:22:48,527
Ah, Osterkamp,
everything all right?

226
00:22:48,565 --> 00:22:49,874
Yes, sir.

227
00:22:49,909 --> 00:22:52,081
Then it can begin.

228
00:22:53,397 --> 00:22:55,634
- Come with me, Kesselring.
- Yes.

229
00:23:01,526 --> 00:23:03,827
Don't stand around
like a bunch of pigs!

230
00:23:03,861 --> 00:23:05,388
Fall in!

231
00:23:05,429 --> 00:23:08,746
I'll let the lot of you
swim over the Channel!

232
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:10,131
Attention!

233
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:17,907
In the ditch! March!
Get off the road!

234
00:23:20,726 --> 00:23:22,636
Attention!

235
00:23:57,879 --> 00:23:59,951
There they come.

236
00:24:28,664 --> 00:24:31,763
If we lose the war now...

237
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,353
they'll tear our arses asunder.

238
00:24:37,304 --> 00:24:39,574
Arrow to Rabbit Leader.

239
00:24:39,609 --> 00:24:41,464
Vector 1-6-0.

240
00:24:41,497 --> 00:24:42,958
Bandits one hundred plus.

241
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,277
Angels 1-5.

242
00:24:44,312 --> 00:24:46,833
Bandits one hundred plus. Over.

243
00:24:49,081 --> 00:24:50,488
Rabbit to Arrow.

244
00:24:50,521 --> 00:24:52,277
I can't see them.

245
00:24:52,313 --> 00:24:54,866
But they must be there.

246
00:24:54,905 --> 00:24:57,524
Well, come have a look
for yourself then.

247
00:24:57,561 --> 00:25:00,081
Nothing, I repeat, nothing.

248
00:25:00,122 --> 00:25:01,747
Group, please.

249
00:25:09,017 --> 00:25:11,122
Everything we've got,
and get them moving.

250
00:25:11,162 --> 00:25:13,366
They've caught us this time.

251
00:25:13,402 --> 00:25:15,507
They're turning northwest.
It looks like London.

252
00:25:15,546 --> 00:25:16,691
It's London, all right...

253
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:19,119
and we've got everything up
covering airfields.

254
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,599
Where is the Royal Air Force?

255
00:26:15,612 --> 00:26:17,336
- Messerschmidt.
- Iron Corps.

256
00:26:17,372 --> 00:26:18,485
Messerschmidt!

257
00:26:18,524 --> 00:26:20,434
No, they ain't.
They're Iron Corps.

258
00:26:31,228 --> 00:26:32,821
Five seconds.

259
00:26:38,045 --> 00:26:39,289
Away!

260
00:26:47,389 --> 00:26:48,469
Away!

261
00:28:06,208 --> 00:28:08,117
The pressure's dropping again.

262
00:28:41,633 --> 00:28:44,982
This is as far
as I can get, lad.

263
00:28:58,914 --> 00:29:02,045
Down at the end there,
by that car.

264
00:29:18,626 --> 00:29:21,047
- Hey, no you don't.
- What do you mean?

265
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:22,519
There's a thousand-pounder
down there...

266
00:29:22,563 --> 00:29:23,937
and it's not gone off.

267
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:25,247
If you're looking
for somebody...

268
00:29:25,283 --> 00:29:27,039
they're all down
at the church hall.

269
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:39,486
They got the Rose 'n' Crown.

270
00:29:44,931 --> 00:29:47,233
He'll have to drink
at the Red Lion now.

271
00:29:47,267 --> 00:29:48,412
If they'll have him.

272
00:29:56,291 --> 00:29:58,146
How bloody stupid can you get?

273
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,154
I spend half a leaf seeing you
all safe in the country...

274
00:30:00,196 --> 00:30:01,440
and you bring her back
to all this.

275
00:30:01,475 --> 00:30:02,719
I'm sorry, it's just
we missed everyone.

276
00:30:02,755 --> 00:30:04,250
You're all going back.

277
00:30:04,292 --> 00:30:05,721
Dad, have you finished it?

278
00:30:05,764 --> 00:30:07,193
Have you got it?

279
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,446
Thank you.

280
00:30:25,925 --> 00:30:28,314
There's a family
trapped in Shaw Street.

281
00:30:30,084 --> 00:30:31,994
Can we have
some more volunteers?

282
00:30:45,349 --> 00:30:46,810
I'll be back, luv.

283
00:31:10,758 --> 00:31:13,572
Stop that bloody bell!

284
00:31:23,206 --> 00:31:25,759
It came more from the back.

285
00:31:48,327 --> 00:31:50,694
Not real Spitfires.

286
00:31:50,727 --> 00:31:52,582
They couldn't land here.

287
00:31:52,615 --> 00:31:54,503
You'll see in a minute.

288
00:31:54,535 --> 00:31:57,438
Only officers fly Spitfires.

289
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,901
You're not a fighter pilot.

290
00:31:59,944 --> 00:32:02,082
What about your top button?

291
00:32:04,904 --> 00:32:07,359
Anybody can do that.

292
00:34:23,564 --> 00:34:25,539
T-5? What's that?

293
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,770
They're a training
squadron, sir.

294
00:34:28,813 --> 00:34:30,700
The Poles.

295
00:34:30,733 --> 00:34:34,345
Get them out of it.
Get them down.

296
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:37,959
Blackhawk Leader,
vector 2-3-0...

297
00:34:37,997 --> 00:34:40,714
and return to base
immediately. Over.

298
00:34:40,749 --> 00:34:43,945
Blackhawk Leader.
Received and understood. Out.

299
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:46,948
Blackhawk Leader to "A" flight.

300
00:34:46,989 --> 00:34:52,706
Turn to port and steer 2-3-0.

301
00:34:52,749 --> 00:34:54,888
Germans! Germans, on the right!

302
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,828
- I don't see! Where?
- Down there on the right!

303
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:59,463
I see the Jerries. I see!

304
00:34:59,501 --> 00:35:06,147
Stop that Polish chatter
and steer 2-3-0.

305
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,302
Repeat, please.

306
00:35:07,342 --> 00:35:10,724
I say again, 2-3-0.

307
00:35:10,766 --> 00:35:12,359
Repeat, please.

308
00:35:12,398 --> 00:35:17,384
For crying out loud, 2-3-0!

309
00:35:17,423 --> 00:35:19,878
- Repeat, please.
- Repeat, please.

310
00:35:19,918 --> 00:35:23,180
Now, just shut up,
the lot of you, and follow me...

311
00:35:23,214 --> 00:35:25,451
unless you're blind
as well as...

312
00:35:26,863 --> 00:35:28,805
Oh, God's truth.

313
00:35:47,056 --> 00:35:48,463
Shut up!

314
00:35:48,496 --> 00:35:50,797
Silence, in Polish!

315
00:36:09,329 --> 00:36:12,046
Get out quickly!

316
00:36:17,297 --> 00:36:20,428
One, the R.A.F.
Is not a flying circus.

317
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:28,012
Two, strict R.T. Procedure
will be observed at all times.

318
00:36:33,394 --> 00:36:37,191
And it is never... repeat,
never... to be used...

319
00:36:41,362 --> 00:36:45,486
for private Polish chitchat.

320
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:51,913
Finally, and God alone
knows why...

321
00:36:51,954 --> 00:36:53,896
I've received
the following signal.

322
00:36:55,634 --> 00:36:59,856
"Congratulations. As of today,
this squadron is operational."

323
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:01,003
Signed, "Keith Park...

324
00:37:01,042 --> 00:37:02,700
"Air Vice Marshal,
A.O.C. 11 Group."

325
00:37:07,154 --> 00:37:09,391
I was wrong about the Poles.

326
00:37:09,426 --> 00:37:12,110
We also have the second
Polish squadron, sir.

327
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:13,805
I thought you'd mention that.

328
00:37:13,843 --> 00:37:15,981
All right.
Make them operational.

329
00:37:16,019 --> 00:37:17,874
And the Canadians?

330
00:37:17,907 --> 00:37:20,777
And the Czechs.
We need them all.

331
00:37:32,243 --> 00:37:34,131
Looks like London again, sir.

332
00:37:34,163 --> 00:37:35,374
Yes.

333
00:37:38,324 --> 00:37:41,259
And there's nothing
we can do about it.

334
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:44,912
But if Goering
should concentrate...

335
00:37:44,947 --> 00:37:48,176
on London by day...

336
00:37:48,212 --> 00:37:50,001
it's another matter.

337
00:37:50,036 --> 00:37:52,786
If it means he leaves
my airfields alone...

338
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,893
I shan't complain.

339
00:37:54,932 --> 00:37:56,820
Even a few days would
give me the chance...

340
00:37:56,852 --> 00:37:58,413
to get back to full strength.

341
00:37:58,452 --> 00:38:01,103
He'll have farther to come.

342
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,449
And to go back.

343
00:38:02,484 --> 00:38:04,786
We'll have more time
to intercept.

344
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:08,781
What's more important, Park...

345
00:38:08,821 --> 00:38:11,090
his fighters
have only fuel enough...

346
00:38:11,124 --> 00:38:13,972
for ten minutes over London.

347
00:38:14,004 --> 00:38:16,655
His bombers will lose much
of their protection.

348
00:38:16,693 --> 00:38:19,213
For the first time...

349
00:38:19,253 --> 00:38:23,661
they'll all come within
the range of 12 Group.

350
00:38:25,461 --> 00:38:28,309
Perhaps now,
at last, we shall see...

351
00:38:28,341 --> 00:38:31,440
what Leigh-Mallory's
Big Wings are made of.

352
00:38:34,581 --> 00:38:39,567
Turning on London could be
the Germans' biggest blunder.

353
00:38:44,086 --> 00:38:46,704
Spider Leader,
this is Top Hat Control.

354
00:38:46,742 --> 00:38:50,190
Bandits now twenty miles
east of you, heading southeast.

355
00:38:50,229 --> 00:38:52,139
Vector 1-2-0.

356
00:38:52,182 --> 00:38:54,637
- Make, Angel 2-0.
- Roger, Top Hat.

357
00:38:54,678 --> 00:38:58,060
Fox Trot Leader,
this is Tango Control.

358
00:38:58,102 --> 00:39:00,656
Fox Trot Leader,
Pass your message.

359
00:39:00,694 --> 00:39:04,174
I have some trade for you
building up over green "A."

360
00:39:04,215 --> 00:39:06,222
Roger, Tango.

361
00:39:09,367 --> 00:39:11,985
Spider Leader, Top Hat Control.

362
00:39:12,022 --> 00:39:14,641
Your customers appear
to be splitting up.

363
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:17,843
Main course heading for London
will be your target.

364
00:39:17,879 --> 00:39:21,043
Vector 0-9-0.

365
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:23,381
Roger, Top Hat.

366
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:32,178
Batman Control.
Climb to Angels 1-9.

367
00:39:32,216 --> 00:39:33,710
Roger, Batman.

368
00:39:41,431 --> 00:39:42,741
Thank you again.

369
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,935
This should give them
something to think about.

370
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:51,759
Starlight Control to Dogtail.

371
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,710
Keep an eye out
for a friendly wing...

372
00:39:53,752 --> 00:39:55,661
joining you on your port side.

373
00:39:55,704 --> 00:39:58,093
Roger, Starlight.

374
00:39:58,137 --> 00:40:00,592
I see them. I see them.

375
00:40:00,632 --> 00:40:02,290
Bloody marvelous.

376
00:40:02,329 --> 00:40:04,631
Fox Trot Leader, Tango Control.

377
00:40:04,664 --> 00:40:07,664
Bandits now probably
slightly below you.

378
00:40:07,704 --> 00:40:09,614
Roger, Tango. I've got them.

379
00:40:13,785 --> 00:40:16,785
Peewee Leader
turning starboard now.

380
00:40:18,809 --> 00:40:21,045
Watch out for 109s about.

381
00:40:21,081 --> 00:40:24,015
Roger, Fairfield Leader.
Going up now.

382
00:40:24,058 --> 00:40:26,327
Take the left-hand pair,
Blue Leader.

383
00:40:26,361 --> 00:40:27,474
Roger.

384
00:40:27,513 --> 00:40:29,237
Everybody else, keep tight.

385
00:40:35,226 --> 00:40:36,852
Swarms of them, sir!

386
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:38,799
Fox Trot Leader, cut that out.

387
00:40:38,842 --> 00:40:40,500
Everyone keep quiet.

388
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:23,034
Leave the flaming fighters.

389
00:41:23,067 --> 00:41:25,140
It's the bloody bombers
we want.

390
00:41:41,212 --> 00:41:43,863
Ox, will you pipe down?

391
00:41:43,899 --> 00:41:46,288
On fire, son of a gun!

392
00:41:56,412 --> 00:41:58,747
Ox! Behind you!

393
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:00,024
Behind!

394
00:42:06,332 --> 00:42:10,489
I am on fire! I'm bailing out!

395
00:43:03,198 --> 00:43:05,021
Good afternoon.

396
00:43:05,054 --> 00:43:09,876
Good afternoon my ass,
you Boche bastard.

397
00:43:09,919 --> 00:43:11,828
Put your hands up!
Come on, put them up!

398
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:13,180
What is it?
I'm a Polish pilot...

399
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:14,524
Cor blimey.
Your mitts, mate... your mitts.

400
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:16,250
Put 'em up there.
Go on. Get going.

401
00:43:16,287 --> 00:43:21,109
Where are you taking me?
I'm fighting on your side!

402
00:44:27,937 --> 00:44:29,399
Can we get in?

403
00:44:29,441 --> 00:44:31,776
- And fetch the doctor.
- Good.

404
00:44:33,058 --> 00:44:35,098
I know, young man.

405
00:44:37,057 --> 00:44:39,130
Get out of the way, man.

406
00:44:45,441 --> 00:44:47,580
It's coming. It's coming.

407
00:44:52,418 --> 00:44:56,030
Are you telling me
that your losses are critical?

408
00:44:56,066 --> 00:44:58,335
We're bombing day and night,
Reichsmarschall.

409
00:44:58,371 --> 00:45:01,120
Our losses are high,
and our pilots are tired...

410
00:45:01,155 --> 00:45:02,464
and the planes need servicing.

411
00:45:02,499 --> 00:45:06,143
Be specific!
What are you telling me?!

412
00:45:06,179 --> 00:45:09,277
The English
have changed tactics.

413
00:45:09,315 --> 00:45:12,064
Changed tactics? How?

414
00:45:12,099 --> 00:45:14,968
They are attacking
in large numbers.

415
00:45:15,011 --> 00:45:17,531
Our losses might be reduced
if our formations...

416
00:45:17,571 --> 00:45:20,920
were more closely escorted
by fighters, sir.

417
00:45:20,963 --> 00:45:22,817
The fighters are always there.

418
00:45:22,851 --> 00:45:25,633
But not close enough,
is that it?

419
00:45:25,667 --> 00:45:27,456
You, yourself,
were a fighter pilot.

420
00:45:27,491 --> 00:45:29,880
The fighter is a hunter, sir.

421
00:45:29,923 --> 00:45:31,516
I was a fighter pilot.

422
00:45:33,188 --> 00:45:34,846
I was not a coward!

423
00:45:34,884 --> 00:45:37,339
There is no suggestion
of cowardice, sir!

424
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:39,290
I am making the suggestion!

425
00:45:41,924 --> 00:45:46,780
From now on the fighters will
stay close with our bombers.

426
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:48,446
And lose their
natural advantages...

427
00:45:48,484 --> 00:45:51,419
of surprise and speed?

428
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:54,210
You will obey orders!

429
00:45:54,244 --> 00:45:58,784
The invasion cannot begin
until we have cleared the skies.

430
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:04,638
Come, my friends,
I have chastised you enough.

431
00:46:04,676 --> 00:46:07,426
But I am here to help him.

432
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:10,111
Is there anything you want?

433
00:46:10,149 --> 00:46:12,254
Foehn? Falke?

434
00:46:12,293 --> 00:46:14,660
Yes, sir,
a squadron of Spitfires.

435
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:37,123
Stop... vapor trail.

436
00:46:37,158 --> 00:46:38,947
Left and above.

437
00:46:38,981 --> 00:46:40,956
Vulture Leader to everyone.

438
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:43,202
Keep quiet. Hold positions.

439
00:46:49,158 --> 00:46:51,198
We'll encircle them
only when they close up...

440
00:46:51,238 --> 00:46:52,667
to firing distance.

441
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:10,882
We'll take the rear starboard.

442
00:47:10,918 --> 00:47:12,577
Yellow, you take the port.

443
00:47:12,615 --> 00:47:14,557
Roger.

444
00:48:55,914 --> 00:48:58,597
Thanks awfully, old chap.

445
00:49:00,555 --> 00:49:02,377
Sir, you know...

446
00:49:02,411 --> 00:49:05,029
I have promised the Fuehrer...

447
00:49:05,066 --> 00:49:09,769
to clear the skies
and totally destroy the R.A.F.

448
00:49:12,523 --> 00:49:14,890
I expect to be obeyed!

449
00:49:22,795 --> 00:49:24,202
Here we are.

450
00:49:24,235 --> 00:49:27,083
The miracle of the loaves.

451
00:49:27,116 --> 00:49:30,083
We should have moved in here
before we were bombed.

452
00:49:30,123 --> 00:49:35,426
Maggie, I'd like you to meet
our new assistant controller.

453
00:49:35,468 --> 00:49:40,203
Squadron Leader Tom Evans,
Section Officer Harvey.

454
00:49:41,676 --> 00:49:43,051
How do you do?

455
00:49:43,084 --> 00:49:44,808
Hello.

456
00:49:44,844 --> 00:49:46,949
He knows your old man.

457
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:49,991
How is Colin?

458
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:52,646
Haven't seen him
since my little escapade...

459
00:49:52,684 --> 00:49:54,091
with the burning Hurricane.

460
00:49:54,124 --> 00:49:55,586
Excuse me, ma'am.

461
00:49:55,629 --> 00:49:58,662
Ma'am. There's a call for you.

462
00:49:58,701 --> 00:50:01,319
Will you excuse me
just a minute?

463
00:50:01,356 --> 00:50:03,877
- Yes.
- Thanks.

464
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:05,379
It's around the corner.

465
00:50:09,293 --> 00:50:10,405
Hello?

466
00:50:10,445 --> 00:50:12,387
It's me.

467
00:50:12,429 --> 00:50:14,763
How on earth did you
get through here?

468
00:50:14,797 --> 00:50:16,258
Put it down to rank.

469
00:50:16,301 --> 00:50:18,570
I said I was an old battle-ax
from the Air Ministry.

470
00:50:18,605 --> 00:50:21,671
Colin. That was very clever.

471
00:50:21,709 --> 00:50:23,400
Any news?

472
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:25,063
About?

473
00:50:25,101 --> 00:50:27,883
Your posting, you silly idiot.

474
00:50:30,894 --> 00:50:32,301
Well, you've applied.

475
00:50:32,333 --> 00:50:34,221
I've been so busy here.

476
00:50:34,254 --> 00:50:36,141
It's really not as simple
as all that.

477
00:50:36,174 --> 00:50:37,668
Look, why the hell not?

478
00:50:37,710 --> 00:50:39,652
To be absolutely honest,
I forgot.

479
00:50:39,693 --> 00:50:41,417
I know, darling. I'm sorry.

480
00:50:41,454 --> 00:50:42,698
Groopy's here now.

481
00:50:42,734 --> 00:50:45,189
I'll go and talk to him
right away. All right?

482
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:47,751
All right?

483
00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:49,132
Colin?

484
00:50:52,015 --> 00:50:53,160
Colin?

485
00:50:55,310 --> 00:50:58,092
Get through all right, sir?

486
00:50:58,127 --> 00:50:59,272
Yes.

487
00:51:00,591 --> 00:51:02,478
Let me give you
a piece of advice.

488
00:51:02,511 --> 00:51:04,485
What's that, sir?

489
00:51:04,527 --> 00:51:05,934
Stay single.

490
00:51:22,384 --> 00:51:25,384
Are you still with me,
Dogtail Red-2?

491
00:51:25,423 --> 00:51:26,852
Affirmative, Red Leader.

492
00:51:26,895 --> 00:51:29,164
Directly behind you
and on your starboard side.

493
00:52:34,801 --> 00:52:37,420
What happened to Harvey?

494
00:52:37,458 --> 00:52:39,629
He got a 1-0-9,
then ran into trouble...

495
00:52:39,666 --> 00:52:40,876
but he's all right.

496
00:52:40,914 --> 00:52:43,434
No mistake.
I saw him bail out.

497
00:52:44,402 --> 00:52:47,435
Right, right, attention.

498
00:52:48,658 --> 00:52:51,440
Right. Stand at ease.

499
00:52:51,474 --> 00:52:54,670
Corporal Seymour will detail
you to your various watches.

500
00:52:56,530 --> 00:52:58,254
I left out the bit
about the wolf whistles.

501
00:52:58,291 --> 00:52:59,469
You're better at that.

502
00:52:59,506 --> 00:53:01,361
The troops have other things
on their minds nowadays...

503
00:53:01,395 --> 00:53:02,540
thank goodness.

504
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:04,586
Right! Shun!

505
00:53:12,851 --> 00:53:14,639
It's Colin.

506
00:53:14,675 --> 00:53:17,425
He isn't dead, Maggie.

507
00:53:17,459 --> 00:53:19,314
He's going to be all right.

508
00:53:21,107 --> 00:53:24,620
They can do wonders
nowadays, you know.

509
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:27,759
It's just a question
of time, that's all.

510
00:53:31,699 --> 00:53:34,121
We'll get you a posting
so you can be near him.

511
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:39,726
Is he badly burned?

512
00:53:52,597 --> 00:53:54,385
You sent for me, sir?

513
00:53:54,421 --> 00:53:57,138
Yes, Peter. I want you
to take over Red Section.

514
00:53:59,573 --> 00:54:01,777
Who are my numbers
two and three, sir?

515
00:54:01,812 --> 00:54:04,747
A couple of new lads.
They're outside.

516
00:54:11,317 --> 00:54:13,357
Right, then.

517
00:54:13,397 --> 00:54:15,153
How many hours on spits?

518
00:54:15,189 --> 00:54:17,361
- Ten, sir.
- Seven, sir.

519
00:54:17,397 --> 00:54:22,002
Stick to me like glue
and keep your eyes open.

520
00:54:34,678 --> 00:54:38,769
Control. Put out 2-2-2
and 6-0-3 Squadrons...

521
00:54:38,806 --> 00:54:40,628
against Hostile 2-6.

522
00:54:40,662 --> 00:54:43,793
Winston would pick
a day like this to come.

523
00:54:55,126 --> 00:54:57,014
Is everything up?

524
00:54:57,046 --> 00:54:59,119
The lot, sir.

525
00:54:59,158 --> 00:55:01,395
- Reserves?
- None.

526
00:55:02,935 --> 00:55:05,717
That's what I've just told
the prime minister.

527
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:40,214
Red-3, this is Red-1.

528
00:55:40,248 --> 00:55:43,957
Much closer.
I can hardly see you.

529
00:55:43,992 --> 00:55:48,116
Red-2.
You must keep up with me.

530
00:55:48,152 --> 00:55:51,251
Right, Red Section. Here we go.

531
00:55:51,289 --> 00:55:53,656
Stick to me like glue.

532
00:56:07,001 --> 00:56:09,041
Red-3, behind you!

533
00:58:30,973 --> 00:58:33,013
Come in, Blue-2.

534
01:00:46,210 --> 01:00:49,058
Hey, kids. Shut up, will you?

535
01:00:49,091 --> 01:00:51,611
This is the BBC home service.

536
01:00:51,650 --> 01:00:53,690
Here is the 9:00 news...

537
01:00:53,730 --> 01:00:57,047
and this is Armand Adell
reading it.

538
01:00:57,091 --> 01:00:59,098
Up till 8:00 tonight...

539
01:00:59,139 --> 01:01:02,488
165 German aircraft
have been destroyed...

540
01:01:02,531 --> 01:01:06,208
in big scale attacks
attempted by the enemy today...

541
01:01:06,243 --> 01:01:08,698
on London and the southeast.

542
01:01:08,739 --> 01:01:12,765
We lost thirty fighters
with ten of the pilots safe.

543
01:01:15,011 --> 01:01:17,859
Buckingham Palace
has been bombed again...

544
01:01:17,891 --> 01:01:20,281
but no one was hurt.

545
01:01:25,892 --> 01:01:28,576
Yes? Yes, one moment.

546
01:01:28,612 --> 01:01:31,295
It's the air minister, sir,
on the scrambler.

547
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:35,612
Yes?

548
01:01:35,652 --> 01:01:39,514
Dowding. Look,
our people in Washington...

549
01:01:39,556 --> 01:01:41,793
are having trouble
with the American press...

550
01:01:41,828 --> 01:01:44,162
and it's about today's figures.

551
01:01:44,196 --> 01:01:46,083
German sources there
are saying...

552
01:01:46,116 --> 01:01:49,728
that our claims
are wildly exaggerated.

553
01:01:52,613 --> 01:01:54,435
Hello?

554
01:01:54,469 --> 01:01:55,810
Are you there, Dowding?

555
01:01:55,845 --> 01:01:57,820
I'm here, Minister.

556
01:01:57,861 --> 01:01:59,933
Well, can you verify
the figures?

557
01:02:01,829 --> 01:02:05,244
I'm not very interested
in propaganda.

558
01:02:05,285 --> 01:02:08,384
If we're right,
they'll give up.

559
01:02:08,421 --> 01:02:11,650
If we're wrong, they'll be
in London in a week.

560
01:02:41,831 --> 01:02:44,678
- Morning, Arnold.
- Morning, sir.

561
01:02:44,711 --> 01:02:46,140
Morning, sir.

562
01:02:47,591 --> 01:02:49,696
- Morning, Arnold.
- Morning, Clyde.

563
01:03:01,031 --> 01:03:02,525
Dispersal.

564
01:03:05,863 --> 01:03:07,805
Right.

565
01:03:07,847 --> 01:03:09,506
Tea's up.

566
01:04:48,874 --> 01:04:50,368
Good morning, sir.

567
01:04:50,411 --> 01:04:52,483
Good morning.

568
01:04:52,522 --> 01:04:54,465
They are late
this morning, sir.

569
01:04:56,939 --> 01:05:00,005
The bastards
are up to something.

570
01:05:05,547 --> 01:05:09,256
Quick march!

571
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:27,137
You have not only let me down!
You have betrayed me!

572
01:06:00,000 --> 01:07:00,000
