最新情报是，希特勒在法国观光
latest intelligence is that hair hitler is sightseeing in france

163
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,279
天气比较宜人哦，我的意思是

164
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:02,320
他在度假，我不是在抱怨部长

167
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:18,159

as many as a hundred fighters a week well after seeing you i want to be able

168
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,559
回到内阁，告诉他们

你对我一样有信心我知道
that you're as confident as i am damn it man we've got

170

650架飞机，那里有2500架飞机
650 planes and they have 2 500 aircraft isn't there

171
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,760
我们有雷达防喷罩，对雷达充满信心
and we have radar jet shield puts great faith in radar

172
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:44,080
这很重要，但不会击落飞机
and it's vital but it won't shoot down aircraft

173
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,799
我必须说你没有完全散发出乐观的精神
i must say you don't exactly exude a spirit of optimism

174
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:55,520
上帝愿意，我们将支持部长，我明白了，所以我告诉内阁，你是
god willing we will hold out minister i see so i tell the cabinet that you're

175
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,360
相信雷达并向上帝祈祷是正确的
trusting in radar and praying to god is that right

176
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,919
我准确地说是反过来，我相信上帝并为雷达祈祷
i accurate the other way around i'm trusting in god and praying for radar

177
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,679
但是最重​​要的算术是我们的年轻人
but the essential arithmetic is that our young men

178
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:12,159
将不得不以四比一的比率击落他们的年轻人
will have to shoot down their young men at the rate of four to one

179
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,840
如果我们要跟上一切
if we're to keep pace at all

180
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,760
是油压检查仪表
it's the oil pressure service the gauge is being checked

我在苏格兰发现很多孩子脸颊都不好
i find in scotland a lot of kids with down on their cheeks

188
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,720

yeah training them to be fighter pilots is a damn sight more dodgy than fighting

189
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,720
德国人好，你必须赢得新的条纹
