You don't worry

The winningest a cappella group
of all time.

29
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,259
The Barden Bellas,
an unlikely group of not-men

who somehow managed to win
at something

49
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,400
to get a real singer.
I have a couple thoughts.

your song was always great.

00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:41,090

is what you gave me

- Pimp-Lo!

that you should know.

80

- Wow.

- Mm-hmm.

84
00:04:55,811 --> 00:04:58,040
- Still menstruating? Hmm.
- Okay.

excuse us for a second.

Sides? Well, we...

89
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,549
Why are we always talking
about sides?

90
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,450
Okay, it's our job, brah.

91
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,559
We're producers.

92

96
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,639
I finally quit my job.

97
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:27,009
And I'm free, I'm free.
I'm never going back

I mean, I can't be

100
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,540
a music producer
without integrity.

102
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,210
What?

103
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,649
Wait. S-Something's wrong.

104
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,149
Your face is more pinched
than normal.

105
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,519
I-I finally did it.

106
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,650
You got back together
with Jesse?

107
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,559
No! You know the long-distance
thing didn't work.

108
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,029
He lives 3,000 miles away
with his girlfriend

109
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,399
- and their cat.
- Oh.

110
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,499
He got over you much quicker
than what I thought.

111
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,199
- Oh, thank you, Amy.
- Much faster than Bumper,

112
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,500
who is rightfully
still devastated.

113
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:00,339
You know he got a tattoo
of me on his butt cheek?

114
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:04,409
So now, every time he wants
to see me, he's like...

115
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,509
He's just...

116
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,409
- Okay. Um...
- That made me dizzy.

117
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:10,149
- Wait, what's up?
- I quit my job.

118
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,379
- You got fired?
- Oh, come on.

119
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,649
All right.
I-I didn't get fired.

120
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:14,719
- I quit.
- Come here.

121
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,519
You're kind of making it worse.

122
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,520
Let this negative energy
be released!

123
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:20,689
Seriously, open your legs.
It'll come out quicker.

124
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,359
- No, no.
- It'll come out quicker,

125
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,299
- the bad energy.
- Why do you do this stuff?

126
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,599
- Okay, seriously.
- Why are you like this?

127
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,999
- You're gonna come back from this so fast.
- Mm.

128
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,469
You know why? Because you have
an amazing best friend.

129
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:32,639
Is that you?

130
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,739
Yeah.

131
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,209
- Okay.
- And also...

132
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:37,479
You need to pay the rent.

133
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,040
Just a little.

134
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,109
Uh, every month,
we have to do it. Ugh.

135
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,179
Right.

136
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,210
Yeah.

137
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,619
You could get a job, you know.

138
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,749
Beca, you're in shock.

139
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,480
You need something to eat.

140
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:49,519
- Yeah. Just sit down.
- Oh.

141
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,989
Not these, though.
They're mine.

142
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:54,320
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Chloe!

143
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,489
Why aren't you guys ready?

144
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,490
Why are you wearing that?

145
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,299
- What?
- Did you wear that to work?

146
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,569
- Yeah, underneath my scrubs.
- Well, sweetie, why?

147
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:04,530
Because it reminds me
I was special once.

148
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:08,569
But also because tonight
is, you... you know...

149
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:13,279
the Bellas reunion
at the Brooklyn Aquarium.

150
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,709
- Hello!
- That's tonight?

151
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,349
- Aw, yeah!
- You know what?

152
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:17,410
I will take it.
I need a distraction anyway.

153
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:20,549
- Yeah. Yes, you do! Whoo!
- I love it. Here we go!

154
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:21,380
What happened?

155
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,789
- She got fired today.
- No.

156
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:31,290
- Hey, Stacie.
- Oh, my God!

157
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,629
- Finally!
- Aw. Good to see you.

158
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:36,260
What's up, pitches?

159
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,800
- I know, I know.
- Hi, Beca.

160
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:41,700
I missed you guys so much.

161
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,539
I can't wait for us
to sing together.

162
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,240
I'm so excited.

163
00:07:44,241 --> 00:07:45,670
Hey, ladies.

164
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,240
Let's crush this.

165
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,479
- Hello.
- Stacie!

166
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,310
Hi!

167
00:07:50,311 --> 00:07:51,779
Hey, Bellas.

168
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,119
- Hi!
- Hi!

169
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,780
Thank you so much
for inviting us.

170
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:57,319
- Of course.
- So, what do you want us to sing tonight?

171
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,650
A little "Who Run the World,"
some "Bulletproof"?

172
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,389
You didn't tell us
what the crowd was,

173
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,820
- but I, um...
- What's she talking about?

174
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,529
I brought this, just in case.

175
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:05,759
- Oh, God.
- Our voices are warm.

176
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:12,439
Um, we didn't
invite you guys to sing.

177
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,499
We invited you to...

178
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,609
- watch us sing.
- Watch.

179
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:19,839
Aca-scuse me?

180
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,309
I just thought you guys
were so busy with your...

181
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:25,720
your awesome jobs
and amazing lives.

182
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,289
Papaya Player's Delight?

00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:33,289
With a shot of white privilege.

184
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:38,360
Oh. Hey, baby.

185
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:41,159
Mayday! Mayday!

186
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,699
We're going down!

187
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,399

You know, you've got
these great jobs, right?

197
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,489

Okay. Great.

go get ready.

204
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,769
But you guys, I'll, um...
I'll see you guys?

205
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:21,539
- After? Okay.
- Totally.

All right, maybe.

256
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,730
Thanks.

257
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:34,469
You know, we could just start
singing right now.

258
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:35,769
Lilly could lay down a beat.

We already look like
the B-team Bellas.

You guys!

262
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:42,969
You guys, I am so sorry.

263
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,039
I realize I should not have
used the word "reunion."

264
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,749
I should have said that it was
an excuse to see each other.

265
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,010
I really didn't think that out.

266
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,379
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no.

267
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,510
You guys were so great.

268
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,979
And this was
a really nice chance

269
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,049
for us to get together.

270
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:55,289
Right, ladies?

271
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,619
- Yeah, sure.
- Oh, yes.

272
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,389
Oh, yes, really great.

273
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,689
- So great.
- Thank you so much.

274
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:03,629
I was supposed to go
to my brother's wedding,

275
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:06,059
- but this is nice, too.
- Aw.

276
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,029
- Yeah.
- Bellas, a toast.

277
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,299
- There!
- Toast! Yay!

278
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,669
To the most amazing

279
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:14,469
group of women
I have ever known.

280
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,509
I would do anything

281
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,070
to sing with you guys again.

282
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,939
Anything!

283
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:23,449
I mean, really,
I could just crap myself!

284
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:24,479
- Oh.
- Uh-uh.

285
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,680
Cheers.

286
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,689
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I'm having a crazy idea.

287
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,750
Okay, I've mentioned
that my dad is in the Army

288
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,659
and, like, basically killed
Osama bin Laden, right?

289
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,689
Some new information
in that sentence, but okay.

290
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:37,829
Well, what I mean is, he's
kind of a big deal in the Army.

291
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:40,499
And every year, the USO
puts on this performance

292
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,999
to entertain
and support the troops.

293
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,899
And this year,
DJ Khaled is hosting.

294
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,539
He's got, like,
a gazillion hit songs,

295
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,369
and he's super famous.

296
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:50,669
I saw him on a tax commercial.

297
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,909
What if I could get us
an invite?

298
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,579
To sing?

299
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,979
No, to run military dark ops.

300
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:00,579
Yes, of course, to sing.

301
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,649
Is there a competition?

302
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:03,849
There should always be
a competition.

303
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:07,019
Oh, um...
well, well, no, but...

304
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,120
let's sing together again.

305
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:11,559
And... and maybe
I'll see my dad.

306
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,699
Or maybe I won't,
you know, because he has

307
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,460
something really important
to do.

308
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,129
Or maybe I'll be
the most important thing

309
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,369
in his life this time.

310
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:21,470
Maybe.

311
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,509
- Who's with me?
- Me. Mm-hmm.

312
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:29,139
Yeah. I suddenly have a lot
of free time, so hell yeah.

313
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,479
Well, I just got
kicked out of flight school

314
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,149
for killing 300 fake people.

315
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:36,080
- I hate fake people.
- I hate a fake bitch.

316
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:38,950
Can you fly when
you're eight months pregnant?

317
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,759
- What?
- No.

318
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,620
Um...

319
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:43,620
- Look.
- Oh...

320
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,389
That's...
that's eight months pregnant?

321
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,890
You guys didn't notice?

322
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,399
- Well, congratulations.
- Oh, my God.

323
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,829
Ah!

324
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,899
- I mean, I'm so happy for you.
- Amazing!

325
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,539
Do you know who the father is?

326
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,639
Eh.

327
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,900
- Oh.
- Congratulations.

328
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,839
Happy accidents.

329
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,470
Okay, well, Stacie's out.

330
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,040
So I guess, Emily, you're in.

331
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:06,179
- Oh, yeah. I'm in for sure.
- Yeah!

332
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,919
Yay.

333
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,780
- Was I not always in?
- Um...

334
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,149
- Oh, no, no, no. Of course.
- Yes.

335
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,189
Oh, cool. I... Okay.

336
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:15,789
Cheers!

Hola, señoritas.

346
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,089
Where'd you guys even come from?

347
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:49,759
A little town called
Persistence, sweet cheeks.

348
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,959
That's right.
Here, here's the thing.

349
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,529
Look at this, ladies.

350
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:53,829
All-access passes.

351
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:56,059
We're tall enough
for all the rides.

352
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,899
You can run,
but you cannot hide.

353
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,699
This d'aca'mentary is happening!

354
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,030
We're gonna film
this whole thing.

355
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:02,900
It's gonna be beautiful.

356
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:04,199
We're making a beautiful
d'aca'mentary.

357
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,569
In fact, we gotta set up.

358
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:06,639
Where are we gonna set up, John?

359
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,640
I want to give you the...

360
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:09,670

Welcome to Spain, Bellas.

366
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:27,729
A few important things
to note before we begin.

367
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,890
Grab your luggage.

368
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,960
All right, thank you.

369
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,099
You always want
to stay 25 feet...

370
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,139
...choke.

371
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,539
...very sharp. We do not
want you to impale yourself.

372
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:48,079
I hope you all heard
each and every word,

373
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,150
or else you might
very well end up dead.

374
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:54,749
Ladies, I'm messing with you.

375
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,989
On behalf of the Department
of Defense, we would like

376
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,289
to welcome you to
Naval Air Station Rota, Spain.

377
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:01,759
And a sincere thank-you
for coming out to entertain

378
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,990
our troops and their families.

379
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,629
We're excited for this tour.

380
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,229
My name's Chicago.
Over here to my left

381
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,669
is Captain Bernie,
who we like to call Zeke.

382
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:11,099
- Ladies.
- We're gonna be with you the whole tour

383
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,969
- as your escorts and security details.
- Question.

384
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:15,010
Will we all be
showering together?

385
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:21,049
Uh, first up is a sound check.

386
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:24,210
We'll have you back
to the hotel by 1430.

387
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,779
Maybe hit the rain locker,

388
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,649
back here for the big show
at 1700. Yeah.

389
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:32,060
1700... is that,
like, later than the night?

390
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:34,189
It's 5:00.

391
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,720
Okay. Whatever.

392
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:38,029
- Okay... Yep.
- Question, question.

393
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,060
Um, so this is the first base.

394
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,940
Will we be going to second base
with you guys?

395
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,899
And then,
maybe a few days later,

396
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,869
we'll go to third base?

397
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,970
That's a "no" for me, so...

398
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,309
Wait, what's after
the third base?

399
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,279
Why don't we get you
to your first venue?

400
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,779
Come on.

401
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,949
All right, well, we are

402
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,179
really excited to have you here.

403
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,819
Right now we're in Hangar Three.

404
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,849
This is where we keep
all of our helicopters.

405
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:04,719
Of course, now we've got
the big stage

406
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,219
built up for the tour.

407
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:09,020
So, on the tour,
we've got three bands.

408
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,929
Over here, we got Saddle Up.

409
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:13,699
This is Young Sparrow
and DJ Dragon Nutz.

410
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,829
And behind me is Evermoist.

411
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:17,299
Oh!

412
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,699
And check it out.
DJ Khaled just rolled in.

413
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,899
Let's set the stage,
all right?

414
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,969
- Let's get ready before the...
- So we should turn around

415
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:23,939
- and shoot into it, I think.
- ...the Bellas out.

416
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:24,940
- Get the Bellas...
- Hey, guys.

417
00:17:24,941 --> 00:17:26,109
Come say hey to the new group.

418
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:27,709
- Yo.
- Oh.

419
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:30,140
Hello. We're the Bellas,

420
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:33,179
formerly of Barden University
and currently of life.

421
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,080
- Ladies.
- Howdy.

422
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:36,289
- Hey.
- Ladies, I want

423
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:37,689
to give you
a little forewarning.

424
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,150
My man's social anxiety,

425
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,259
when he's not behind the
turntables, it's kind of crazy.

426
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,129
- So be easy, all right?
- Hello.

427
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,759
<i>♪ Hello ♪</i>

428
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,799
<i>♪ Is it me you're looking for? ♪</i>

429
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,929
Right on. I'm Calamity.

430
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:54,330
This is Serenity,
Veracity and Charity.

431
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,300
- Hey.
- Hi.

432
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:58,339
If I joined your group,
I could be Obesity.

433
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:01,379
- Get it?
- Oh, if you're wondering,

434
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,340
- our presence here has nothing to do with...
- Nothing.

435
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,679
...the nationally televised
"Salute to the Troops" special

436
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,719
where DJ Khaled is going to
pick one group to open for him

437
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,880
at the end of this tour.

438
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,989
That was a lot of exposition.

439
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,159
So there is a competition.

440
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,659
I knew it.

441
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,089
- And so there is.
- Idiots!

442
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,159
What, do you think we

443
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,759
care about just watching
you guys?

444
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,299
It's a competition! Hello!

445
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,729
You guys just sing
other people's songs, right?

446
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:27,030
- Like a cover band.
- No, no, no, no.

447
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,169
- No.
- Uh, no, no, no. Uh, well,

448
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:31,239
actually, Emily writes
original songs for the Bellas.

449
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,909
I mean, I don't really
do it anymore.

450
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,409
- I kind of did that one, and then I...
- Hey.

451
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:36,409
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
You with us or against us?

452
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:38,909
And it was one of your dads
who gave you

453
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,449
the spot on the tour, right?

454
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:42,449
- Oh, my God.
- Um...

455
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:43,420
- Ooh...
- Guys, stop.

456
00:18:43,421 --> 00:18:44,919
They just don't like
sharing the spotlight,

457
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,989
so they're trying
to intimidate us.

458
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:48,159
Let's just take the high road
and do what we do.

459
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,420
You thinking what I'm thinking?

460
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,060
What are you thinking?

461
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,060
A riff-off.

462
00:18:51,061 --> 00:18:53,929
- That's not what I was thinking.
- A riff-off!

463
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:56,260
Wait. Yes.
A riff-off! Yes!

464
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:58,060
- What is a riff-off?
- Yeah.

465
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,399
A riff-off is a little game

466
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,939
that we like to play

467
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,900

00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,809

- Nice.

469
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,239
Yeah, and then we
lay down a beat.

470
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,139

00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:20,849
Yeah, so you guys saw
what we did there, right?

00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,910
- Yeah.

No, well...

494
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:26,119
We just took the last word
of the old song

495
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,319
and matched it
with the first word

496
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,189
of the new song,
but you stay on tempo,

497
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,889
stay on beat,
stay on pitch and, of course,

498
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,920
- keep it in the relative key.
- That was great.

499
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:34,459

were Jewish"?

505

The GRE is coming up.

00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,669
It's right around the corner.
Uh, and...

618
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:50,699
I got a hamster now.

619
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,469
Aw. That's amazing.

620
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:54,869
Well, don't give up.
My dad always says,

621
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:56,339
"Age wrinkles the body,

622
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,879
but quitting
wrinkles the soul."

623
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,450
Hmm.

624
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:05,379
- Three...
- How about those Bulls?

625
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,749
Gotta love those Cubs.

626
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:11,689
And the deep dish pizza,
'cause it's so...

627
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:13,230
deep.

628
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,859
Chicago.

629
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,159
Right?

630
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,790
Yeah, I'm actually from Georgia.

631
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,859
Oh.

632
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,260
So, what's your story?

633
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,399
Why are you here?

634
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,199
Oh, boy. Um...

635
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,269
Long story short,
I was in the NG,

636
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:29,409
but my CO recommended me
for OCS after, uh, AIT.

637
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:32,239
Then came OBC
and RTB where I, uh,

638
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,209
was the, uh, DG of my class.

639
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:36,609
It's... I don't know.

640
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:38,379
Sorry. Um...

641
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:40,149
I joined the National Guard.

642
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:41,649
They helped put me
through college.

643
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:44,519
I spent about
a year stationed in Kabul.

644
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,619
Uh, actually overseeing
a canine unit over there.

645
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,189
We trained German shepherds,

646
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,890
we trained pit bulls...

647
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,759
Dogs.

648
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,859
I love dogs.

649
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,560
I love animals, in general.

650
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:58,169
- Animals are cute.
- You're cute. I mean, what?

651
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:00,230
- What about you?
- Me? Me.

652
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,400
Uh, shorter story...

653
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:03,769
I was in a singing group
in college,

654
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:08,509
and then now I am still
in that same singing group,

655
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:10,549
but not in college.

656
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:11,809
- But you're committed.
- I am committed.

657
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:13,279
- That's great.
- Yeah, I love commitment

658
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,619
- and being committed.
- Yeah.

659
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,549
- Not to, like, an asylum. Whoa.
- Right.

660
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:17,950
Or, like, a hospital, like,
it's... I'm not saying...

661
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,689
- Yeah, no, I know.
- But, like... just, I like...

662
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:21,689
I love love.
I love being committed to love.

663
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:24,529
Not to you, but to, like...
I love, um, like, oranges.

664
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:25,759
- Oranges.
- I love...

665
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,899
Hey. Uh, girls?

666
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,560
- Hmm?
- We have separate rooms. We don't have to

667
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:30,699
sleep on top
of each other anymore.

668
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,829
- What?
- Hey, that's great.

669
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,399
Um, not sexually.

670
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,870
There was that one time.

671
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,580
Stop being so loud.

672
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:51,389
- Yeah. No, yeah.
- Oh, that's what I want.

673
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:52,619
Uh, no, that's the molasses one.

674
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,319
No, you're not gonna
like that one.

675
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,589
- This one.
- I don't want molasses.

676
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,520
Okay, you guys,
so we've never

677
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:59,489
competed against bands
that play actual instruments.

678
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:00,629
What's the plan?

679
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:03,529
I really think we should just
stay true to ourselves,

680
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:05,730
- and it will all figure itself out.
- Emily?

681
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:08,339
- Mm-hmm.
- Please hear this in the best way possible.

682
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,999
You're a very stupid person.

683
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
You know what?
Maybe it won't matter

684
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:14,570
if we win or not, because
they will like us so much

685
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,539
that they will invite us
to keep touring with them.

686
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,409
And it won't matter
if I get into vet school

687
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:20,009
because we will be together
as a family,

688
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:21,619
supporting each other.

689
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,450
And really, isn't that
what it's all about?

690
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,450
- Yes.
- Yes.

691
00:28:25,451 --> 00:28:26,989
Yeah, except for all families
break apart,

692
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:30,960
and the only person you can
ever truly rely on is yourself.

693
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:35,490
All right, time to drop a smash.

694
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,629
- What?
- Oh, no, no, no.

695
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:40,870
- Think it's a whole album.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

There now, Sir Bounce-a-lot.

700
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,959
You take good care
of my Turnip Top.

701
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,060
Eh?

702
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,549
Well, it's a big night
for the Bellas, Gail.

703
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:33,019
First stop on the tour...
Rota, Spain.

704
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:35,050
Here we go.

705
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,819
Young Sparrow!

706
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,689

00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,839
You guys, this is the first time

713
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,709
we're performing together
in three years.

714
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:58,979

Hola.

720
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,789
Uh, hola. Um...

721
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:16,590
- Uh, excusez-moi.
- Bonjour. Ciao.

722
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,999
- No hablo...
- Inglese? Konnichiwa?

723
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,729
- The...
- Sa-na-ma-na-ma?

724
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:22,599
You're English. Hi.

725
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,999
That's right. I saw you do
the, uh, sound check,

726
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,469
- um, thing that you guys...
- Yeah. The riff-off thing.

727
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:29,709
- Riff-off.
- Yeah. I don't know why we

728
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:30,939
keep challenging people
to those.

729
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,479
We... we don't ever
actually win.

730
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,479
- Oh.
- Do you work for the USO?

731
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,549
Uh, no, I-I work for DJ Khaled.

732
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:38,079
Sorry. I'm-I'm Theo.

733
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,880
- Hi. I'm Beca.
- Hi.

734
00:30:38,881 --> 00:30:41,080
- Nice to meet you.
- How you doing?

735
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:41,880
Sorry, you are a...

736
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:43,519
- Oh, I'm a...
- Music executive?

737
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,619
...music exec
at Khaled's label.

738
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,859
- Really?
- Yeah.

739
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,620
- What?
- No, I-I... I work

740
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:49,029
with music executives,
and you...

741
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:50,990
they... they don't look
like you.

742
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,159
Oh.

743
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,829
What... what do I look like?

744
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:55,730
A turtle.

745
00:30:55,731 --> 00:30:59,169
Well, that's in...
incredibly specific.

746
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:01,100
But, like, you literally
look just like that.

747
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,539
No, no. It's accurate.

748
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,770
You said you work
with music execs.

749
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:07,039
Oh. Yeah. Um, no, I'm a...

750
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,579
I'm a music producer.

751
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,149
I'm sort of freelancing
right now.

752
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:11,810
Oh, and I sing for fun.

753
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:14,419
I'm interested to see
the Bellas in action.

754
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:17,789
Yeah, maybe we'll even open
for DJ Khaled in the end.

755
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,819
You don't think
you'll open for Khaled?

756
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:22,059
Uh, no, I-I...
I didn't say that.

757
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:24,529
Yeah, you did. You did.
You just said it before.

758
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:25,799
You kind of implied it,
if anything.

759
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,129
- Well, I just...
- I could just

760
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:29,999
tell him that you sing
for fun, if you like.

761
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,699
No, I-I was just trying to...
I-I'm-I'm...

762
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,499
I'm gonna go now.
I'll see you later,

763
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,669
but I'll be watching.

764
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:36,040
- Okay.
- Good luck. See you.

765
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:39,979
- What was that?
- That was so much eye contact.

They are Evermoist.

Evermoist?

778
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:24,019
Who came up with that name?

779
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:26,519
My bum crack's a bit dry.

780
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,259
Does anyone have
an Evermoist towelette?

781
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:33,629
My grandma's in a band
right now... Nevermoist.

809
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:23,330
Oh, wow!

810
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:25,739
Who doesn't want to see that
on "Salute the Troops"

811
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:28,109
next week, huh? Keep it going.

812
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:29,709
Whoo!

813
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:31,609

00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:37,980
an a cappella group
with a few YouTube clicks.

817
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:40,989
So, put your hands together
for the Bellas.

818
00:34:41,921 --> 00:34:45,259
The Bellas reunited
finally onstage.

819
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,820
They're gonna rock these troops
with their mouth music.

820
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:49,859
And, as predicted, Gail,

821

872
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:58,749
That, my friend, was "Taps"

873
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,050
from the back of the house.

874
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,250
Salute, salute.
We have to salute.

875
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,059
Stand at attention.
This is "Taps."

876
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:05,129
It's to honor fallen soldiers,

877
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:07,229

it's the fallen Bellas.

don't even know what to do.

This is the best thing
for the movie.

881
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:15,370
It couldn't be better.

882
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:20,009
Should we be considering
using instruments?

883
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:21,539
Is that crazy?

884
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,379
Oh, that's so funny.

885
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,510
You know, I'm gonna pretend
that you didn't just say that

886
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,610
so we can still be friends.

887
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:29,349
If we had drums,
then we wouldn't need Lilly,

888
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:31,119
and if we had bass,
then we wouldn't need me.

889
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:31,990
And we're still not clear

890
00:37:31,991 --> 00:37:33,550
why Jessica and Ashley
are even here.

891
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,289
D-Did they just say our names?

892
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:36,889
Don't be stupid.

893
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:38,559
You know what? I have an idea.

894
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,399
We just need to show DJ Khaled
that we are different

895
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,560
and better than all
of those other bands, you know?

896
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:45,969
I think we did great.

897
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:48,230
I just think the horn
cut our vibe.

898
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,369
True that.

899
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:51,909
All right, ladies.
Pick up your tits.

900
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:53,139
We're going out.

901
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,309
What do you mean, "going out"?

902
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:55,409
What do you mean,
what do I mean?

903
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:58,040
- We just sucked balls in front of DJ Khaled.
- Hmm?

904
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:00,379
- Listening.
- He's staying at that fancy

905
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,910
casino hotel
across the street, okay?

906
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,449
I say we all get up,
we get dressed,

907
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:06,519
we go over there, and we show
him that we are not a joke.

908
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:10,319
Emily, I can't believe

909
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,889
that a half-decent idea
came out of your dumb mouth.

910
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:15,299
- Thank you.
- Okay?

911
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,329
- So let's get tarted up and...
- Tatted up?

912
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:20,299
- Tarted. Yeah, yeah, tarted up.
- It sounds like "tatted up."

913
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,139
- She means "tatted."
- She's the caramel tart.

914
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,539
She's a chocolate tart.
You're the vanilla tart.

915
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,339
Thanks, babe.

916
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,339
Mm...

917
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:31,209
- Oh, "tarted."
- Oh, "tarted." "Tarted."

918
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:32,979
If it's easier,
we'll just say "slutty."

919
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,049
- Okay, let's get slutty.
- We'll dress slutty.

920
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:35,079
- Let's get slutty.
- Okay, great.

921
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,080

Nothing.

You guys, act normal, casual.
Here we go.

962
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:17,249
- Great idea.
- Patricia,

963
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:19,049
you know how worried
I've been about you?

964
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,180
You shouldn't have run away.

965
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:21,719
You should've talked to me.

966
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:26,289
About what, the C-4 explosives
I found in the cereal box?

967
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:28,589
Or what about the time
you smuggled drugs

968
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:30,529
in Sir Bounce-a-lot
and I had to see him

969
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:34,599
get torn apart by custom agents
right in front of me?

970
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,599
Sweetheart,
it was my profession.

971
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,469
What, being dodgy?

972
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,500
Well, that's one word for it.

973
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:44,739
I mean, yeah, I was a criminal,
but I'm different now.

974
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,179
How'd you even find me?

975
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,309
Well, what do you mean?

976
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:48,609
I've been in hiding.

977
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:50,140
Ah, my darling girl,

978
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:52,079
I've known where
you've been for years.

979
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:55,480
Uh, it's impossible for you
not to stand out in a crowd.

980
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:57,249
Yeah, why do I have to be
so brilliant

981
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:58,589
at every single thing I do?

982
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:01,059
Here, look.
I've always kept this photo

983
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:03,489
of you and me close to my heart.

984
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:06,199
We used to play together.
We used to sing together.

985
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,529
We used to be a team.

986
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:09,599
- None of this is happening, okay?
- But-but...

987
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,130
No "but, but, but." No!

- I was waiting for you.
- I don't... That's weird.

1014
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:29,440

behind the bushes.

No, I don't think so.

I'll give you a tour.

1030
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,699
- Great.
- All right, come this way.

1031
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:55,730
Uh, Khaled, right now he's, uh,
into this kind of feng shui,

1032
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,839
so he has a specific kind
of arrangement

1033
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,800
to maximize his chi.

1034
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:03,209
And, oh, Sunburst here
is Khaled's juiceologist.

1035
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:05,379
Ah, Theo, pardon my zesting.

1036
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:06,549
Would you like a beet juice?

1037
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:07,849
Your glands look frustrated.

1038
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:09,219
In my country,

1039
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,619
beet juice was reserved
for the king.

1040
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:12,790
DJ Khaled is the king
of the beats.

1041

You know, like the...
Beat King, 'cause he's the...

Oh, honey, that was...
we didn't like that at all.

1043
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:20,759
It's awful. I know.

1044
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:24,359
Um, can you explain this,
uh, terrifying situation?

1045
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,499
- What? What, my... the face?
- Not your face.

1046
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,699
- Um, the thing behind you.
- Oh, the apiary.

1047
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:31,900
- Hmm.
- Oh, right, yeah, no, this is, uh, a portable beehive

1048
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:34,639
that Sunburst uses
to harvest natural honey.

1049
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,709
Doesn't seem like a disaster
waiting to happen.

1050
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:37,610
Yes, it can be.

1051

Oh... yeah, just her.

1057
00:43:46,251 --> 00:43:47,580
Just borrow her for a second.

1058
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:48,619
Whatever.

1059
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:51,389
Ooh. Is that an AKG C-24?

1060

Yes, it certainly is.

Oh, I'm happy for them.
That's nice.

1064
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:00,629
Yeah,

for whenever inspiration
strikes him,

1066
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,499
- so we have this setup here.

00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:34,489
- Khaled.
- Oh, okay. I...

1101
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:35,859
- Yeah? I'll be right back.
- Do you want me to...

1102
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:37,559
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. Carry on.
- Okay.

1103
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:38,759
- Carry on. That's okay.
- I wasn't gonna leave anyway.

1104
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,429

1110
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:54,009
I knew that song would get you.

1111
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:55,379
- Whoo-hoo!
- Oh, yeah.

1112
00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:58,579
That's my girl.

1113
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:00,449
I can't wait.

1114
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:02,049
We'll travel the world
in my yacht,

1115
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:05,689
stop at all your favorite
places... the Atlantic Ocean,

1116
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:07,450
- the Pacific Ocean...
- That would be great!

1117
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:09,859
But I'm in the middle
of a tour right now.

1118
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:11,889
But that's perfect.
I'll finally be able

1119
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:13,859
to see one of your performances.

1120
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:16,329
Dad, you've never come
to any of my performances.

1121
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:19,669
Sweetheart, I've changed.

1122
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:22,639
It's not the first time
I've heard that.

1123
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:26,639
But you're still my little
Turnip Top, aren't you?

1124
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:30,809
I promise I won't
screw it up this time.

1125
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:33,079
General Posen and I
were wrapping up

1126
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:34,849
a, uh, clandestine operation.

1127
00:46:34,850 --> 00:46:37,949
In fact, I've just come
from our classified briefing.

1128
00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:40,750
Oh, my God, so you were just
with Aubrey's dad?

1129
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,559
He was so excited
to see your show.

1130
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,500
It's just too bad
that he can't make it.

1131
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:48,359
- Oh.
- Oh.

1132
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:49,899
Oh, that's okay.

1133
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:51,829
- Yeah, it's-it's really okay.
- No, that's okay.

1134
00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:53,769
- It's totally fine. You know, he's a busy man.
- Uh-huh.

1135
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:55,769
- That's right.
- And my dad always said,

1136
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:58,909
"Expect finite disappointment,
and remember,

1137
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:00,709
there's always more
where that came from."

1138
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:02,579
Oh, my God, Aubrey!

1139
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:16,689
Someone open a window!

1140
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:18,990
- What is wrong with this door?
- I don't know!

1141
00:47:20,990 --> 00:47:23,999
Stand down!

1142
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,469

1145
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:40,149
Checkmate, Bellas.

1146
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:42,480
Checkmate.

1147
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:49,859
Oh, hey.

1148
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:52,489
Heard you all really, uh,
lit it up last night.

1149
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:55,029
That's a great joke.

1150
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:56,759
- It's really funny.
- Like a phoenix

1151
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:00,469
rising from the ashes,
only a really sad version

1152
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:02,630
where there's no phoenix
and just ash.

1153
00:48:21,090 --> 00:48:24,189
Sorry, I forgot where we were
in the conversation.

1154
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:27,790
Next time, when you're trying
to impress DJ Khaled,

1155
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,929
try to have some dignity.

1156
00:48:29,930 --> 00:48:33,929
Uh, we never do anything
with dignity, so...

1157
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:35,540
Hey, where'd you go last night?

1158
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:37,799
What, uh, you mean

1159
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,800
when you were burning down
the hotel?

1160
00:48:39,810 --> 00:48:41,069
Dude, where were you?

1161
00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:44,039
Okay. I was with my father,
all right?

1162
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,679
Wait, your dad?

1163
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,479
He's been trying
to track me down for years,

1164
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:48,679
and last night, he found me.

1165
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,849
Why are you running from him?

1166
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:52,780
I wish my dad
would pay attention to me.

1167
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:55,919
Because my dad
wasn't a very nice man.

1168
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,789
So, when I was 18,
I had to run away,

1169
00:48:58,790 --> 00:49:01,689
which was a real bitch
because of the chafing.

1170
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:04,690
And now he has found me,

1171
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:07,829
and I don't know what to think.

1172
00:49:07,830 --> 00:49:11,639
I mean, I-I think that's
amazing, and so should you.

1173
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:14,039
I mean, it-it's...
it's a crazy thing.

1174
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:16,139
He's finally found you
after all these years?

1175
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:18,509
Now you can rekindle
the relationship,

1176
00:49:18,510 --> 00:49:20,240
and-and it could be
even stronger than it was.

1177
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:22,210
And maybe he was not
a very nice guy before,

1178
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:24,110
but maybe he is now,
and maybe he's amazing

1179
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:26,249
- and wonderful and he wants...
- Okay, Emily, you are so shrill

1180
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:27,749
- and inarticulate!
- No, no!

1181
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:30,819
Hello? Oh, it's Stacie.

1182
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:33,059
Stacie! Stacie's calling me
on FaceTime.

1183
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:34,789
- You guys! Stop. Get over here.
- What, Stacie?

1184
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:36,489
- Oh, hello?
- Wait. Right over here.

1185
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:37,790
- Oh, hi, hi, hi.
- You guys!

1186
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,899
- Hi.
- Stace!

1187
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:42,029
- Where are you?
- Stacie, it's going terrible here.

1188
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:43,730
Yeah, we getting our asses
handed to us.

1189
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:47,000
Guys, I had the baby.

1190
00:49:48,270 --> 00:49:49,609
- What?
- Aw.

1191
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:50,669
He's so cute.

1192
00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:52,570
She's a girl.

1193
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:53,909
Oh, okay, then average.

1194
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:55,009
What's her name?

1195
00:49:55,010 --> 00:49:56,779
Baby Fat Amy
or Baby Fat Patricia.

1196
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:58,719
- You can choose.
- No, no, listen.

1197
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,019
I know I've always been
your favorite.

1198
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:02,020
Guys.

1199
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:04,789
I named her Bella.

1200
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:06,119
Aw.

1201
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:07,759
- That is adorable.
- Oh, that's perfect.

1202
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,259
- That... Okay.
- I love you guys.

1203
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:11,759
- We love you. We love you so much.
- We miss you.

1204
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:12,999
You guys.

1205
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,599
She's so cute.

1206
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,599
Guys, can we stop trying
to win this tour

1207
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,030
and just sing together?

1208
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,239
I mean, that's why
we're all here, right?

1209
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,939
Yeah.

1210
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:25,170
But also, let's still try
and win this thing

1211
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:28,039
because I don't know
how else to live.

1212
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,549
Ciao, Bellas.

1213
00:50:30,550 --> 00:50:31,849
Who wants to go to Italy?

1214
00:50:31,850 --> 00:50:33,579
Four countries in four days.

1215
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:35,319
- One, two...
- And then DJ Khaled will announce

1216
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:38,050
the winner when we arrive
in France. Let's do this!

actually seem

1226
00:51:05,910 --> 00:51:07,949
to be enjoying themselves, Gail.

1227
00:51:07,950 --> 00:51:09,919
I think
it's possible the Bellas

1228
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,089
could be picked by DJ Khaled.

1229
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:14,159
You can say that again,
and I hope you won't.

Well, the soldiers
are loving them.

We can meet DJ Khaled
any time you want.

1259
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:22,389
Yeah, no, absolutely.

Bellas! Make some noise
for Bellas out there! Whoo!

1275
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:06,299
What a fitting swan song
for the Barden Bellas.

1276
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:08,199
Yes, and as these young women
approach 30

1277
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,199
and cease to be of value
as human beings,

1278
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,339
perhaps this
is the bittersweet memory

1279
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:15,339
they will take
into the bar with them.

1280
00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:31,820
Okay,
welcome to the South of France.

1281
00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:34,229
We wanted to do something
kind of special for you guys.

1282
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:35,959
Wow.

1283
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:37,829
This feels like a group date
on The Bachelor.

1284
00:53:37,830 --> 00:53:39,829
Oh, it's just so beautiful.

1285
00:53:39,830 --> 00:53:41,899
Yeah, thank you.

1286
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:43,369
Not free.

1287
00:53:43,370 --> 00:53:44,869
Got it.

1288
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:46,369
Hey.

1289
00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:51,379
Um, hey, I just wanted to say
thank you for... for this.

1290
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:54,379
- Oh.
- And for looking out for us on this trip.

1291
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:58,749
And protecting
the United States... always.

1292
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:00,380
It's my pleasure.

1293
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:01,849
Must be kind of lonely,

1294
00:54:01,850 --> 00:54:03,349
always being away
from your family,

1295
00:54:03,350 --> 00:54:05,389
- being in a different place.
- Yeah.

1296
00:54:05,390 --> 00:54:07,320
But being in the Army
is kind of like

1297
00:54:07,330 --> 00:54:09,129
having a second family,
you know.

1298
00:54:09,130 --> 00:54:11,359
Well, yeah, of course you know.

1299
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:13,999
I mean, you guys come together
for your tour,

1300
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,529
and when it's over,
you go your separate ways.

1301
00:54:15,530 --> 00:54:19,269
But you're always gonna
be there for each other, right?

1302
00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:23,239
I mean, you're never
really alone.

1303
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:26,279
Wow, that was really cheesy.

1304
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:27,509
No.

1305
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:28,980
I liked it.

1306
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:36,150
You okay?

1307
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,550
Oh, yeah.

1308
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:40,230
Of course.

1309
00:54:41,230 --> 00:54:43,029
Don't hide your feelings
from me.

1310
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:45,090
We're like sisters, Aubrey.

1311
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:48,160
It is "Aubrey," isn't it?

1312
00:54:48,170 --> 00:54:51,269
Mm-hmm.

1313
00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:54,039
Well, to be totally honest,
my dad was supposed to come

1314
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,439
to see us perform tomorrow,

1315
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,239
and I heard
that he can't make it.

1316
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:59,909
And he's never actually
heard me sing with the Bellas,

1317
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:02,279
and now maybe
he never will, so...

1318
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:04,310
Dad? He's here!

1319
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:05,819
What? Where?

1320
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:09,280
That's my dad's yacht,
the Fat Dingo Bitch.

1321
00:55:09,290 --> 00:55:11,289
That's what he always
used to call my mum.

1322
00:55:11,290 --> 00:55:13,319
- Oh.
- Obviously, he's come

1323
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:16,059
to see me perform
in our last ever show!

1324
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:17,529
My dad came!

1325
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:19,429
Must feel aca-amazing.

1326
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:27,269
They gotta be
close to making a decision.

1327
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:29,339
They film the special
with DJ Khaled tomorrow.

1328
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:31,339
And he needs an opening act.

1329
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:34,179
Oh, look who it is.

1330
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:37,349
Did you guys see the way
they got off stage yesterday?

1331
00:55:37,350 --> 00:55:38,979
They literally went out
of their way

1332
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:40,349
not to congratulate us.

1333
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:42,990
They clearly just see us
as a threat.

1334
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:46,919
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, my God.

1335
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,159
- You are so weird.
- Wow. Sometimes.

1336
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,259
That's not fair.
You seem very nice.

1337
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:51,929
Can I borrow you for a second?

1338
00:55:51,930 --> 00:55:53,190
- Yeah, great.
- Yeah? Come on.

1339
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,200
- Great.
- You want to hold hands?

1340
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:55,200
- Nope.
- Cool.

1341
00:55:55,201 --> 00:55:56,299
Where are we going?

1342
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:58,599
You remember when you
burnt down DJ Khaled's room?

1343
00:55:58,600 --> 00:55:59,999
- No, that was not...
- No?

1344
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,169
- I don't remember that.
- Back in Spain?

1345
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:02,499
- No.
- You were looking for Lenny,

1346
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:04,100
hiding behind the bushes,
released the bees.

1347
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:05,509
No, I think that...
that was my sister.

1348
00:56:05,510 --> 00:56:06,569
I hate her. What?

1349
00:56:06,570 --> 00:56:08,179
DJ Khaled wants to meet you.

1350
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:11,110
- Why?
- Hey, boss.

1351
00:56:12,110 --> 00:56:14,110
Theo, my guy.

1352
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:16,119
Magical ears.

1353
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:17,990
- Beca.
- H-Hello.

1354
00:56:19,190 --> 00:56:21,119
- How beautiful.
- Oh, thank you.

1355
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,919
- So nice to meet you.
- ASAP!

1356
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:24,159
Need a drink for Beca, ASAP!

1357
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,160
Have a seat.

1358
00:56:25,161 --> 00:56:26,359
Make yourself at home.

1359
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:27,659
Oh, my God.

1360
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:29,159
- Thank you.
- Just...

1361
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,060
- Yeah.
- Here you go, mademoiselle.

1362
00:56:31,070 --> 00:56:32,329
Thank you.

1363
00:56:32,330 --> 00:56:34,130
I hope you like cherries.

1364
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,269
Beca, have you been talking
to my guy, Theo?

1365
00:56:36,270 --> 00:56:37,469
Yeah, he talks a lot.

1366
00:56:37,470 --> 00:56:39,409
But I have no idea
what's going on.

1367
00:56:39,410 --> 00:56:41,279
He doesn't actually give me
that much information.

1368
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,109
I thought maybe
you could break the news.

1369
00:56:43,110 --> 00:56:44,679
Congratulations.

1370
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:46,109
On what?

1371
00:56:46,110 --> 00:56:48,479
I want you to open up for me.

1372
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:49,919
Tomorrow night.

1373
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,619
Beca.

1374
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:53,689
DJ Khaled.

1375
00:56:53,690 --> 00:56:55,390
Are you ready?

1376
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,030
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

1377
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:02,399
That is great.

1378
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,960
You are not gonna
regret this. I...

1379
00:57:04,970 --> 00:57:08,030
The Bellas are gonna die.
Can I go tell them?

1380
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:09,399
I-I think you misunderstood.

1381
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:11,169
Uh, what DJ Khaled's
trying to say here

1382
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:13,970
is that he doesn't want
the Bellas.

1383
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:16,270
We want you.

1384
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:17,609
- What?
- The other day,

1385
00:57:17,610 --> 00:57:20,279
when you was just
playing around with the loop

1386
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:22,010
and you was singing
and you was just...

1387
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:25,419
I could tell that you was
just playing around, but...

1388
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:29,289
I seen something,
I heard something,

1389
00:57:29,290 --> 00:57:32,089
then I felt something.

1390
00:57:32,090 --> 00:57:33,729
Amidst the chaos,
I went back in the room,

1391
00:57:33,730 --> 00:57:35,129
and I pulled your recording.

1392
00:57:35,130 --> 00:57:38,299
Why did you do that?

1393
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:40,399
Because I wanted to know
what you could do on your own.

1394
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:43,430
Beca, it's time to go
to the next level.

1395
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,100
I see it.

1396
00:57:45,110 --> 00:57:47,439
I'm DJ Khaled, aka Billy.

1397
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:50,239
- Who?
- I know these things.

1398
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:53,579
That is so amazing.

1399
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:55,279
That means the world to me,
honestly.

1400
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:57,149
But I'm part of a group,

1401
00:57:57,150 --> 00:57:58,619
and we all have
something special.

1402
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:01,219
I respect
that you love your group,

1403
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:02,750
but it's time for you
to move on.

1404
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:04,489
It's time for you to grow.

1405
00:58:04,490 --> 00:58:07,620
It's time for you to climb that
mountaintop and reach the top.

1406
00:58:07,630 --> 00:58:09,529
And the group
will be happy for you.

1407
00:58:09,530 --> 00:58:11,660
What Khaled is trying
to say here is that

1408
00:58:11,670 --> 00:58:14,329
you've really gone as far
as you can with the girls.

1409
00:58:14,330 --> 00:58:16,630
It's time for you
to now flourish on your own.

1410
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:19,499
Independent... ly.

1411
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:21,169
These ain't opinions.

1412
00:58:21,170 --> 00:58:22,470
These are facts.

1413
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,009
Yes.

1414
00:58:24,010 --> 00:58:25,539
Come with me a second.

1415
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:26,779
Bless up.

1416
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:29,149
Listen, I... I know it's a lot

1417
00:58:29,150 --> 00:58:30,479
- to take in, okay?
- Uh, yeah.

1418
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,119
The label is gonna
sign you, Beca.

1419
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:34,380
The label's gonna sign you.
They're gonna help you

1420
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:36,789
- develop your own material as a solo act.
- Uh, yeah...

1421
00:58:36,790 --> 00:58:38,589
Th-This is very generous,

1422
00:58:38,590 --> 00:58:40,459
but we're talking
about my family.

1423
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:42,259
- I'm-I'm... I'm not interested.
- It's...

1424
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:44,290
- It's a tough decision. I get that.
- No, it's not.

1425
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:46,660
It is. It is.

1426
00:58:46,670 --> 00:58:49,669
It's a big opportunity for you.
All right?

1427
00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:51,399
Look at me. Stop.

1428
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,410
What are you doing?

1429
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:57,109
Go home. Sleep on it.

1430
00:58:57,110 --> 00:58:58,479
You come back, and you tell me

1431
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:01,579
what you want to do
in the morning, okay?

1432
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:03,549
All right?

1433
00:59:03,550 --> 00:59:06,249
I'm... I really am sorry. I...

1434
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:32,779
Whoo!

1435
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:35,809
Your performance
was incredible, Patricia.

1436
00:59:35,810 --> 00:59:37,649
So proud of you.

1437
00:59:37,650 --> 00:59:39,279
Thanks, Dad.
How did you see it?

1438
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:40,349
Were you on the base?

1439
00:59:40,350 --> 00:59:42,280
Oh, you know me.
I've got my ways.

1440
00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:44,719
What a note to go out on, eh?

1441
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:47,389
What do you say
we leave tonight?

1442
00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:50,459
I would, but tomorrow's, like,

1443
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:52,729
the big televised event
with DJ Khaled,

1444
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:55,199
and they're definitely gonna
pick the Bellas to perform.

1445
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,629
So I need to be there
'cause my talent compensates

1446
00:59:57,630 --> 01:00:00,339
for the weaker members
of the group, like Beca.

1447
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:01,639
Tomorrow it is.

1448
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:04,369
And you can go
wherever you want to go.

1449
01:00:04,370 --> 01:00:06,109
Urban Outfitters?

1450
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:09,740
You gotta think bigger,
Sunshine.

1451
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:11,479
A Caribbean tour.

1452
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:13,319
Have you ever been
to Martinique?

1453
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:16,749
Or the, uh...
the Cayman Islands?

1454
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:19,319
- The Cayman Islands?
- Oh, they're beautiful,

1455
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:21,889
just like my little girl.

1456
01:00:21,890 --> 01:00:23,889
Uh-huh. Right.

1457
01:00:23,890 --> 01:00:25,359
Dad, let me ask you...

1458
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:26,859
what was your favorite moment
of the show?

1459
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:29,499
Well, there were too many
moments of greatness

1460
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:31,299
from which to choose.

1461
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:33,330
'Cause my favorite part
was the bit

1462
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:34,639
where I sang that duet
with Beca,

1463
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:36,539
and then was on the top
of the pyramid.

1464
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:38,469
Oh, yeah.

1465
01:00:38,470 --> 01:00:40,439
Yeah, you were wonderful
in that part.

1466
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:42,509
God! There was no pyramid!

1467
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:44,579
And as if I'd be the top.

1468
01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:47,579
And I know exactly
what's in the Cayman Islands.

1469
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:49,819
Yeah, I do.
That bank account

1470
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:51,919
that Mum set up for me
on my 13th birthday.

1471
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:54,819
She said it was just a bit
of an allowance, but...

1472
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:58,529
I know she didn't want me
to ever need your dirty money.

1473
01:00:58,530 --> 01:01:01,459
How much is even in it anyway?

1474
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:04,630
$180 million, give or take.

1475
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:09,799
When am I gonna learn...

1476
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,740
to open my mail?!

1477
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:15,939
I'm done with you, Dad.

1478
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:17,909
Forever.

1479
01:01:17,910 --> 01:01:20,609
No, no, you're not.

1480
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:23,419
We are done
when I get the money.

1481
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:25,519
Amy?

1482
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:27,450
Is this man bothering you?

1483
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:29,459
- Yes, he is. Yeah.
- Yeah.

1484
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:31,859
Sir, step away from the Bella.

1485
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:35,829
Patricia, all my accounts
are frozen.

1486
01:01:35,830 --> 01:01:38,699
Good-bye, Fergus.

1487
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:42,469
I tried to do this
the nice way, Patricia.

1488
01:01:42,470 --> 01:01:44,910
You remember that!

1489
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:49,709
So, do you know how to do this?
How do you do this?

1490
01:01:49,710 --> 01:01:51,640
- Pour the water over the sugar, and smash...
- Like this?

1491
01:01:51,650 --> 01:01:52,840
Do you guys know where Beca is?

1492
01:01:52,850 --> 01:01:55,449
Theo must have said
something to her by now.

1493
01:01:55,450 --> 01:01:56,919
The show's literally tomorrow.

1494
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:59,480
- I know.
- Guys, if Khaled picks us,

1495
01:01:59,490 --> 01:02:01,560
it'll be our last show together.

1496
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,889
Bellas, a toast.

1497
01:02:04,890 --> 01:02:07,329
- Ah, a Chloe toast.
- They say that...

1498
01:02:07,330 --> 01:02:09,529
home is where the heart is.

1499
01:02:09,530 --> 01:02:14,869
But you guys are the homes
that my heart lives in.

1500
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:17,600
I am inside of all of you.

1501
01:02:19,410 --> 01:02:20,840
It feels so good.

1502
01:02:21,870 --> 01:02:24,340
- Cheers.
- Salud.

1503
01:02:24,350 --> 01:02:26,540
- Cheers!
- Guys, I love you so much.

1504
01:02:26,550 --> 01:02:28,549
- I feel like...
- Are you hallucinating?

1505
01:02:28,550 --> 01:02:31,449
Excuse me.
Uh, are you the Bellas?

1506
01:02:31,450 --> 01:02:33,349
- Yes.
- Oui, monsieur.

1507
01:02:33,350 --> 01:02:34,789
- Sí.
- My name is Henri.

1508
01:02:34,790 --> 01:02:37,589
Chicago sent me to take you
to the USO reception.

1509
01:02:37,590 --> 01:02:39,320
- Uh...
- Reception?

1510
01:02:39,330 --> 01:02:41,590
Chicago never mentioned
any reception.

1511
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:44,299
Something about an announcement?

1512
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:46,799
- Oh. We won.
- Did we win?

1513
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,599
Um, we need
to find our friends,

1514
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,469
- Beca and Fat Amy.
- Great.

1515
01:02:50,470 --> 01:02:53,500
Oh, they are already there
with Chicago.

1516
01:02:53,510 --> 01:02:55,539
- Oh.
- Perfect.

1517
01:02:55,540 --> 01:02:58,409
Let's not keep this
handsome Frenchman waiting.

1518
01:02:58,410 --> 01:02:59,640
- Let's go. Shotgun!
- Ready?

1519
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:00,840
I guess we should go.
Let's go.

1520
01:03:00,850 --> 01:03:03,410
- Hey, let's go.
- Henri?

1521
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:05,719
- Oh, yeah. Whoo!
- Sounds like music.

1522
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:08,889
I am Florencia.

The singing sounded very good.

1537
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:50,659
- Oh, merci beaucoup, Henri.
- Um, are we almost there?

1538
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:52,829
Uh, yes. In fact...

1539
01:03:52,830 --> 01:03:54,929
'Cause it feels like
we've been driving forever.

1540
01:03:54,930 --> 01:03:56,530
...we are right here.

1541
01:03:56,540 --> 01:03:58,330
Yay! Oh, great!

1542
01:03:58,340 --> 01:03:59,839
I don't know.
I can't lift it.

1543
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:01,639
I can't see.
I can't see anything.

1544
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:03,070
Why won't the shade go up?
It's, like, stuck.

1545
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:05,039
- It's so dark out there.
- Can you guys see out yours?

1546
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:08,709
- No, I can't see.
- Well, this don't seem right.

1547
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:10,349
Maybe we...

1548
01:04:10,350 --> 01:04:11,479
- Whoa!
- Oh!

1549
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:13,410
What was that?

1550
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:15,920
I don't know. What was that?

1551
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:19,359
What?

1552
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:22,620
- What happened?
- Huh?

1553
01:04:22,630 --> 01:04:24,429
I don't know.

1554
01:04:24,430 --> 01:04:26,629
Hang on.
You guys, are we...

1555
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:29,399
Are we floating?

1556
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,129
- Why would we be floating?
- What?

1557
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:36,609
Guys?

1558
01:04:36,610 --> 01:04:37,909
You guys, I can't open the door.

1559
01:04:37,910 --> 01:04:39,639
What? The door's not opening?

1560
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:42,079
It's the old van-ferry
death-trap maneuver.

1561
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:44,410
I should've seen it coming.

1562
01:04:44,420 --> 01:04:45,649
- Oh, God.
- What?

1563
01:04:45,650 --> 01:04:48,019
- Open it. Open the door.
- Help!

1564
01:04:48,020 --> 01:04:49,149
Does... does anybody's
cell phone work?

1565
01:04:49,150 --> 01:04:50,150
Where's my cell phone?

1566
01:04:50,151 --> 01:04:51,449
No service.

1567
01:04:51,450 --> 01:04:52,889
No service. There's nothing.

1568
01:04:52,890 --> 01:04:55,589
- That's so inconvenient.
- Hell's bells!

1569
01:04:55,590 --> 01:04:56,920
We could scream
on the count of three.

1570
01:04:56,930 --> 01:04:58,959
- Okay. One, two, three.
- One, two, three!

1571
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:00,500
Help!

1572
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:10,970
Sir Bounce-a-lot.

1573
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:31,529
- I told you we're through!
- I know.

1574
01:05:31,530 --> 01:05:33,859
But there are some people here

1575
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:36,699
who think you should reconsider.

1576
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:40,099
Amy!

1577
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:44,039
How could you?

1578
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:46,939
I swear to God,
if you hurt any one of them,

1579
01:05:46,940 --> 01:05:50,040
except for Jessica and Ashley,
I will kill you!

1580
01:05:50,050 --> 01:05:52,009
I don't want to hurt anyone,
Patricia.

1581
01:05:52,010 --> 01:05:54,979
The only one I wanted was you,
but you weren't with them,

1582
01:05:54,980 --> 01:05:56,549
were you?

1583
01:05:56,550 --> 01:05:58,219
Oh, well.

1584
01:05:58,220 --> 01:06:00,189
Plan B.

1585
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:02,459
You have 30 minutes.

1586
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:03,920
Come to the boat,

1587
01:06:03,930 --> 01:06:06,629
or your friends
swim with the fishies.

1588
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:09,099
And I think you know I mean it.

1589
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:10,929
Oh, I know you mean it.

1590
01:06:10,930 --> 01:06:12,799
Because you're a terrible person

1591
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:15,069
that does terrible things.

1592
01:06:15,070 --> 01:06:17,669
But there's one thing
you're forgetting, Dad.

1593
01:06:17,670 --> 01:06:19,039
I'm your daughter.

1594
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:22,539
Your nightmare blood,
it runs through my veins!

1595
01:06:22,540 --> 01:06:24,240
Hey, Amy, um, I need to talk
to you about something.

1596
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:26,849
- It's kind of important.
- Oh, yeah, just a sec.

1597
01:06:26,850 --> 01:06:28,479
- I'm on a call.
- Okay.

1598
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:29,710
You think you're bad?

1599
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:33,049
You have no idea
what I'm capable of.

1600
01:06:33,050 --> 01:06:35,119
I've graduated college.

1601
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:36,819
I could do anything.

1602
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:39,159
So say your prayers,

1603
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:42,159
'cause Fat Amy is coming...

1604
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:45,029
for you.

1605
01:06:45,030 --> 01:06:46,769
Now!

1606
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:52,169
So...

1607
01:06:52,170 --> 01:06:54,709
which two of you

1608
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:56,940
are Ashley and Jessica?

1609
01:06:58,550 --> 01:07:00,879
- Ah, shit.
- Okay, so...

1610
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:01,949
I have kind of bad news.

1611
01:07:01,950 --> 01:07:04,219
Uh, and I know you're
gonna be fine. Uh, I know

1612
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:06,460
- every-everybody's gonna be fine, but, like...
- Uh-huh.

1613
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:09,289
Oh.

1614
01:07:09,290 --> 01:07:12,159
- Um, w-well...
- Yep.

1615
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:14,159
We didn't get picked, man.
And you know what?

1616
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:16,890
Like, screw them. It's not,
like, the whole story.

1617
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:19,899
There's... uh, uh, uh...

1618
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:21,899
I don't know, I still feel
like I want to tell you

1619
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:22,770
'cause I think that, like,

1620
01:07:22,771 --> 01:07:24,739
secrets are, like,
the worst, right?

1621
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:25,900
So...

1622
01:07:25,910 --> 01:07:27,769
Yeah, it's the worst.

1623
01:07:27,770 --> 01:07:29,170
Let's go.

1624
01:07:29,180 --> 01:07:30,639
Go where?

1625
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:33,050
Don't worry.
We'll change in the cab.

1626
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:39,849
Amy, what are we doing?

1627
01:07:39,850 --> 01:07:42,189
Why are we not calling
the police or Chicago?

1628
01:07:42,190 --> 01:07:44,159
No cops. There's no time.

1629
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:46,689
And if my dad sees 'em,
he'll take off.

1630
01:07:46,690 --> 01:07:47,889
This is serious.

1631
01:07:47,890 --> 01:07:49,659
The Bellas
could really get hurt.

1632
01:07:49,660 --> 01:07:51,629
- Not on my watch.
- Amy, come on.

1633
01:07:51,630 --> 01:07:53,199
Look, I know my father.

1634
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:54,799
I know his guys.

1635
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:56,930
Some of them I know,
like, really well.

1636
01:07:56,940 --> 01:07:59,300
And I know that boat.

1637
01:07:59,310 --> 01:08:01,200
We can do this.

1638
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:03,169
Okay. What's the plan?

1639
01:08:03,170 --> 01:08:06,039
First up, I need you
to pick up the pace.

1640
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:07,950
This boat's not gonna
row itself.

1641
01:08:13,090 --> 01:08:15,089
Okay. That's the ladder
that'll take you

1642
01:08:15,090 --> 01:08:16,919
up to the main deck
where the Bellas are.

1643
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:18,850
Do not let Fergus
hear what I'm doing below.

1644
01:08:18,860 --> 01:08:20,859
Okay, giant distraction
coming up.

1645
01:08:20,860 --> 01:08:23,289
- You sure about this?
- Have I ever let you down?

1646
01:08:23,290 --> 01:08:26,159
Dozens of examples
spring to mind, if I'm honest.

1647
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:28,199
- What?
- Yeah, you're very unreliable.

1648
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:30,199
It's, like, one of the
hallmarks of your personality.

1649
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:32,800
I don't think we have time
to unpack that right now.

1650
01:08:32,810 --> 01:08:35,100
Shh. I'll just see you up top.

1651
01:08:35,110 --> 01:08:36,739
Nobody's gonna die tonight,
right?

1652
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:38,039
- Yeah.
- Right?

1653
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:39,979
- Yeah.
- Well, that doesn't help.

1654
01:08:39,980 --> 01:08:41,609
- Okay.
- Okay, ready?

1655
01:08:41,610 --> 01:08:43,049
I've got my serious face on now.

1656
01:08:43,050 --> 01:08:44,849
- Okay.
- It's time.

1657
01:08:44,850 --> 01:08:46,979
Let's do it.

1658
01:08:46,980 --> 01:08:50,619
Once we get the money,
we sail directly to Sydney.

1659
01:08:50,620 --> 01:08:52,850
Unless she doesn't show.

1660
01:08:52,860 --> 01:08:55,659
Then things get ugly.

1661
01:08:55,660 --> 01:08:57,259
Ten minutes, ladies.

1662
01:08:57,260 --> 01:08:59,730
Guys, you know
what we should do?

1663
01:09:00,930 --> 01:09:02,260
Where did you come from?

1664
01:09:02,270 --> 01:09:03,399
What?

1665
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:04,730
You weren't here before.

1666
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:06,739
I've been here the whole time.

1667
01:09:06,740 --> 01:09:09,170
I'm just small.

1668
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:18,849
Just... if we only have
ten minutes left,

1669
01:09:18,850 --> 01:09:22,019
I say we spend it
doing something we love.

1670
01:09:22,020 --> 01:09:26,290
Let's go out like Bellas and...
and sing one more song.

1671
01:09:28,290 --> 01:09:31,089
You want to sing right now?

1672
01:09:31,090 --> 01:09:33,290
I think we should sing
one more song, though.

1673
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:35,299
I don't know if I feel like singing.

1674
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:39,000
Oh, my God. Guys, I just want
to sing so bad.

1675
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:42,139
We really think you'll like it.

1676
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:44,109
You want to entertain me?

1677
01:09:44,110 --> 01:09:46,170
Knock yourselves out.

1678
01:09:46,180 --> 01:09:47,909
Nine minutes.

1679
01:09:47,910 --> 01:09:49,909
Let's make it a loud one, guys.

1680
01:09:49,910 --> 01:09:51,809
You are terrible
at reading signals.

1681
01:09:51,810 --> 01:09:53,950

You know that's exactly

1694
01:10:43,130 --> 01:10:46,070
You know I can
take your head off, don't you?

1695
01:10:48,470 --> 01:10:50,900
What is the matter
with you two idiots?

You really shouldn't
have put me in a time-out.

01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:18,390
Let's dance.

01:12:22,890 --> 01:12:24,259
Why?

1712
01:12:33,210 --> 01:12:35,439
Whoa. Easy, now. Easy.

1713
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:38,110

01:12:42,610 --> 01:12:44,419
What?

1716
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:14,109
Nipple cripple!

Nipple cripple!

01:13:16,150 --> 01:13:18,120

1719
01:13:22,220 --> 01:13:25,060

Amy, come on! Amy!

1731
01:14:30,590 --> 01:14:32,590
Sweet baby Jesus!

1732
01:14:36,090 --> 01:14:37,659
Amy, let's go!

1733
01:14:42,630 --> 01:14:45,629
- Amy, come on!
- Patricia!

1734
01:14:45,630 --> 01:14:47,470
Stop her!

1735
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:00,579
- Beca! Beca!
- Amy!

1736
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:04,119
Hey, you've been a very
naughty girl, Turnip Top!

1737
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:05,519
Amy! Amy!

1738
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:07,350
Amy!

1739
01:15:12,730 --> 01:15:17,099
I rained hellfire!

1740
01:15:31,510 --> 01:15:33,079
The MPs arrested Amy's dad.

1741
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:34,510
He's going to jail
for a long time.

1742
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:36,179
I'm gonna go meet them,
all right?

1743
01:15:36,180 --> 01:15:37,620
- Okay.
- Sit tight.

1744
01:15:38,690 --> 01:15:40,519
I have no idea
what just happened,

1745
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:43,059
but if Khaled doesn't pick us
after all of that,

1746
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:44,589
what are we doing
with our lives?

1747
01:15:44,590 --> 01:15:47,090
- Right?
- Seriously.

1748
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:48,390
Uh, I think Beca has something

1749
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:50,530
she'd like to share
with the group.

1750
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:53,499
Um, thanks, Amy.

1751
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:54,699
Uh, yeah.

1752
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:58,269
I was gonna say something
earlier, but we were involved

1753
01:15:58,270 --> 01:16:00,300
in a hostage crisis,
so I just...

1754
01:16:00,310 --> 01:16:01,540
They picked her.

1755
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:04,540
DJ Khaled and his team.

1756
01:16:04,550 --> 01:16:05,809
They didn't pick the Bellas.

1757
01:16:05,810 --> 01:16:07,679
They picked Beca.

1758
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:09,749
So they... yeah,
so they only picked her.

1759
01:16:09,750 --> 01:16:13,080
Yeah, but I said no because
I feel exactly how you feel.

1760
01:16:13,090 --> 01:16:16,119
You guys are family, and you
don't walk away from family.

1761
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:17,819
Don't you want to make music?

1762
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:19,389
No, I guess, but...

1763
01:16:19,390 --> 01:16:22,059
Beca, you can't say no.
You've gotta do it.

1764
01:16:22,060 --> 01:16:24,359
Look, your real family
doesn't hold you back.

1765
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:26,300
They lift you up.

1766
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:30,330
Kind of feel like I've been
saying something to that effect

1767
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:31,669
- the entire time.
- Oh, my God, Emily!

1768
01:16:31,670 --> 01:16:34,569
Smart people
are talking right now.

1769
01:16:34,570 --> 01:16:36,670
Aubrey, don't, please.

1770
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:38,679
It's... I-I won't do it.
It's not important.

1771
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:39,879
No, no, no.
It's-it's not that.

1772
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:42,810
You know, I have
to be honest with you guys.

1773
01:16:42,820 --> 01:16:46,419
Every time I perform
in front of people,

1774
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:48,589
I feel like I'm gonna puke.

1775
01:16:48,590 --> 01:16:50,859
And I don't have to anymore.

1776
01:16:50,860 --> 01:16:53,720
I'm so happy.

1777
01:16:53,730 --> 01:16:55,859
- Aw.
- Yes!

1778
01:16:55,860 --> 01:16:57,599
- No more puking.
- Whew!

1779
01:16:57,600 --> 01:16:59,360
- No more puke.
- No more puke.

1780
01:16:59,370 --> 01:17:00,629
Yes.

1781
01:17:00,630 --> 01:17:02,730
You know what?
I think I might just...

1782
01:17:02,740 --> 01:17:06,669
I don't know, move to Mykonos
and become a doula.

1783
01:17:06,670 --> 01:17:09,209
- A doula?
- A birthing coach.

1784
01:17:09,210 --> 01:17:11,239
- You gonna coach babies?
- Mm-hmm.

1785
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:12,750
Yeah, I'll be like...

1786
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:16,179
"Come here, little guy.
You can do it.

1787
01:17:16,180 --> 01:17:17,649
"There ain't really
nothing to it.

1788
01:17:17,650 --> 01:17:19,819
You can do it,
you can do it. Come on!"

1789
01:17:19,820 --> 01:17:21,589
- Ah...
- Now that gay people

1790
01:17:21,590 --> 01:17:24,389
can serve in the military,
I'm-a join the Air Force

1791
01:17:24,390 --> 01:17:26,459
and let them pay
for my flight school.

1792
01:17:26,460 --> 01:17:30,429
I have my Abnormal Psych exam
coming up next week.

1793
01:17:30,430 --> 01:17:32,699
But also, you're gonna
keep writing

1794
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:36,299
so your life isn't filled
with crushing regret, right?

1795
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:38,199
- Yes.
- Good.

1796
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:39,639
Well, guys, a music career

1797
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:41,700
would interfere
with my business, so...

1798
01:17:41,710 --> 01:17:44,879
Yeah, that little tiny
juice truck you work at.

1799
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:46,279
The juice truck I own

1800
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:48,509
and just secured capital
to franchise.

1801
01:17:48,510 --> 01:17:50,549
- Uh, what?
- Cool.

1802
01:17:50,550 --> 01:17:53,680
- I didn't tell you guys?
- Congratulations.

1803
01:17:53,690 --> 01:17:55,250
Cool beans.

1804
01:17:56,250 --> 01:17:57,650
You talk?

1805
01:17:58,660 --> 01:18:01,259
Satan has finally left my body.

1806
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:04,590
Hi. I'm Esther.

1807
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:07,260
- Wha...?
- I have many questions.

1808
01:18:07,270 --> 01:18:10,299
You guys?

1809
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:12,569
I think it's time that we go on

1810
01:18:12,570 --> 01:18:14,669
with the next chapter
of our lives.

1811
01:18:14,670 --> 01:18:18,509
It's time for us to move on.
You know?

1812
01:18:18,510 --> 01:18:20,840
I mean, we're always gonna
be there for each other

1813
01:18:20,850 --> 01:18:22,749
because we're family.

1814
01:18:22,750 --> 01:18:25,410
And, I mean, I, for one,
am very ready.

1815
01:18:25,420 --> 01:18:27,680
I got the call that I got
into vet school.

1816
01:18:27,690 --> 01:18:29,789
- You got in!
- Yes, I got in. I know.

1817
01:18:29,790 --> 01:18:32,759
- No way!
- I got in. I'm a vet.

1818
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:34,789
Congratulations!

1819
01:18:34,790 --> 01:18:36,459
What about you, Ames?

1820
01:18:36,460 --> 01:18:38,259
You sure you're cool with this?

1821
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:39,390
Are you kidding me?

1822
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:41,629
I just found out
I got $180 million

1823
01:18:41,630 --> 01:18:43,829
to put into
"Fat Amy Winehouse."

1824
01:18:43,830 --> 01:18:44,700
- What?
- Yeah.

1825
01:18:44,701 --> 01:18:48,569
- Whoa.
- Wait, I could do more shows.

1826
01:18:48,570 --> 01:18:51,709
"Fat Amy Adams."
"Fat Amy Grant."

1827
01:18:51,710 --> 01:18:53,439
Oh, that would be good
for Christmas.

1828
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:54,539
Would be great.

1829
01:18:54,540 --> 01:18:57,379
- Beca.
- Don't.

1830
01:18:57,380 --> 01:18:59,479
I swear to God,
don't make that face.

1831
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:02,549
If you cry, I'm gonna cry.
I swear.

1832
01:19:02,550 --> 01:19:04,319
I'm not gonna do this
with you today, so...

1833
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:05,589
- I'm not doing it.
- I hate that face.

1834
01:19:05,590 --> 01:19:07,359
- I'm not.
- Don't make that face.

1835
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:08,920
- Don't.
- This is my regular face.

1836
01:19:08,930 --> 01:19:10,389
You know how much I love you.

1837
01:19:10,390 --> 01:19:13,759
You just get out there,
and you crush it.

1838
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:14,829
Okay?

1839
01:19:14,830 --> 01:19:16,599
You crush it so hard

1840
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:19,499
that your nips tingle a bit.

1841
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:20,699
- She loves hugs.
- Don't.

1842
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:22,000
- That's not funny.
- We should give her one.

1843
01:19:22,010 --> 01:19:25,870
- Yay!
- Hugger!

01:19:42,590 --> 01:19:44,020
Here we are.

1852
01:19:44,030 --> 01:19:45,829
The final show, the conclusion

1853
01:19:45,830 --> 01:19:49,529
of the USO Tour
in the South of France,

1854
01:19:49,530 --> 01:19:51,029
coming to you from the Citadel.

1855
01:19:51,030 --> 01:19:54,630
What a gorgeous setting
here tonight under the stars.

1856
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:56,399
Isn't this beautiful?
Doing a wonderful

1857
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:58,500
musical presentation
in a bunker.

1858
01:19:58,510 --> 01:19:59,739
In the South of France.

1859
01:19:59,740 --> 01:20:01,539
I mean, it's so romantic here.

1860
01:20:01,540 --> 01:20:03,009
I've never been to France.

1861
01:20:03,010 --> 01:20:04,509
I hope never to come back.

1862
01:20:04,510 --> 01:20:05,909
Oh, no, it's not
a place for you.

1863
01:20:05,910 --> 01:20:07,879
Oh, no, no.
There's no good people here.

1864
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:08,910
No, no.

1865
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:10,049
On your toes, folks.

1866
01:20:10,050 --> 01:20:12,460
We're on in ten.
First positions.

1867
01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:19,659
Ladies and gentlemen,

1868
01:20:19,660 --> 01:20:23,829
let's give it up for DJ Khaled!

1869
01:20:27,370 --> 01:20:30,400
When I say "fan,"
you say "love."

1870
01:20:30,410 --> 01:20:31,500
Fan!

1871
01:20:31,510 --> 01:20:32,869
- Love!
- Fan!

1872
01:20:32,870 --> 01:20:33,570
Love!

1873
01:20:33,580 --> 01:20:35,409
First of all, I want to thank

1874
01:20:35,410 --> 01:20:37,409
all the troops
for coming out here.

1875
01:20:37,410 --> 01:20:38,940
It's about you.

1876
01:20:38,950 --> 01:20:40,379
We salute you.

1877
01:20:40,380 --> 01:20:42,549
We praise you and thank you.

1878
01:20:42,550 --> 01:20:44,919
But tonight I have a surprise.

1879
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:49,419
I'll be introducing you
to a new star.

1880
01:20:49,420 --> 01:20:50,659
A superstar.

1881
01:20:50,660 --> 01:20:53,729
Somebody that I have cosigned.

1882
01:20:53,730 --> 01:20:56,359
I introduce you to...

1883
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:58,499
Beca Mitchell.

1884
01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:04,600
And here's Beca Mitchell
stepping onto the stage,

1885
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:07,009
just as small as she was
the day she was born.

1886
01:21:07,010 --> 01:21:09,770
You know, we've been following
this little sprite-light lady

1887
01:21:09,780 --> 01:21:12,109
for, I don't know,
seven years now, I think.

1888
01:21:12,110 --> 01:21:13,849
We have been showing you

1889
01:21:13,850 --> 01:21:16,010
her new life
out in the real world,

1890
01:21:16,020 --> 01:21:18,649
where she's out to take
another perfectly good job

1891
01:21:18,650 --> 01:21:19,990
from an able-bodied man.

1892
01:21:21,090 --> 01:21:22,850
