And this year,
DJ Khaled is hosting.

310
00:12:44,772 --> 00:12:46,405
He's got, like,
a gazillion hit songs,

311
00:12:46,407 --> 00:12:48,239
and he's super famous.

312
00:12:48,241 --> 00:12:50,541
I saw him on a tax commercial.
(OTHERS GASPING)

313
00:12:50,543 --> 00:12:52,777
What if I could get us
an invite?

314
00:12:52,779 --> 00:12:54,445
To sing?

315
00:12:54,447 --> 00:12:56,848
No, to run military dark ops.

316
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:00,451
Yes, of course, to sing.
(LAUGHTER)

Is there a competition?

318
00:13:02,523 --> 00:13:03,722
There should always be
a competition.

Oh, um...
well, well, no, but...

let's sing together again.

00:13:08,995 --> 00:13:11,430
And... and maybe
I'll see my Dad.

322
00:13:11,432 --> 00:13:13,565
Or maybe I won't,
you know, because he has

323
00:13:13,567 --> 00:13:15,334
something really important
to do.

324
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,002
Or maybe I'll be
the most important thing

in his life this time.

Me. Mm-hmm.

It's a competition! Hello!

465
00:18:22,174 --> 00:18:24,609
You guys just sing
other people's songs, right?

466
00:18:24,611 --> 00:18:26,911
Like a cover band.
(CHUCKLING) No, no, no, no.

467
00:18:26,913 --> 00:18:28,046
No.
Uh, no, no, no. Uh, well,

468
00:18:28,048 --> 00:18:31,115
actually, Emily writes
original songs for the Bellas.

469
00:18:31,117 --> 00:18:32,784
I mean, I don't really
do it anymore.

470
00:18:32,786 --> 00:18:34,286
I kind of did that one, and then I...
Hey.

471
00:18:34,288 --> 00:18:36,287
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
You with us or against us?

472
00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:38,789
And it was one of your dads
who gave you

473
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,324
the spot on the tour, right?

474
00:18:40,326 --> 00:18:42,326
(GASPS) Oh, my God.
Um...

475
00:18:42,328 --> 00:18:43,295
Ooh...
EMILY: Guys, stop.

476
00:18:43,297 --> 00:18:44,796
They just don't like
sharing the spotlight,

477
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:45,863
so they're trying
to intimidate us.

478
00:18:45,865 --> 00:18:48,033
Let's just take the high road
and do what we do.

479
00:18:48,035 --> 00:18:49,301
You thinking what I'm thinking?

480
00:18:49,303 --> 00:18:49,934
What are you thinking?

481
00:18:49,936 --> 00:18:50,936
A riff-off.
(GASPING)

482
00:18:50,938 --> 00:18:53,805
That's not what I was thinking.
A riff-off!

483
00:18:53,807 --> 00:18:56,141
Wait. Yes.
A riff-off! Yes!

484
00:18:56,143 --> 00:18:57,942
What is a riff-off?
Yeah.

485
00:18:57,944 --> 00:18:59,276
A riff-off is a little game

486
00:18:59,278 --> 00:19:01,813
that we like to play
to see who's better.

487
00:19:01,815 --> 00:19:03,782
Mm-hmm.
We start with a topic. Um...

488
00:19:03,784 --> 00:19:05,683
Let's say "party songs."
Ooh. Nice.

489
00:19:05,685 --> 00:19:07,117
Yeah, and then we
lay down a beat.

490
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:10,020
GAIL: Oh, yeah, bring it, Bellas!

(CHUCKLES)

516
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,997
We just took the last word
of the old song

517
00:20:25,999 --> 00:20:27,198
and matched it
with the first word

518
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,066
of the new song,
but you stay on tempo,

519
00:20:29,068 --> 00:20:30,768
stay on beat,
stay on pitch and, of course,

520
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,804
keep it in the relative key.
CALAMITY: That was great.

I'll give you a tour.

1077
00:42:50,708 --> 00:42:52,608
Great. Yeah.
All right, come this way.

1078
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:55,644
Uh, Khaled, right now he's, uh,
into this kind of feng shui,

1079
00:42:55,646 --> 00:42:57,748
so he has a specific kind
of arrangement

1080
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:59,715
to maximize his chi.

1081
00:42:59,717 --> 00:43:03,119
And, oh, Sunburst here
is Khaled's juiceologist.

1082
00:43:03,121 --> 00:43:05,287
Ah, Theo, pardon my zesting.

1083
00:43:05,289 --> 00:43:06,456
Would you like a beet juice?

1084
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:07,758
Your glands look frustrated.

1085
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,126
In my country,

1086
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,526
beet juice was reserved
for the king.

1087
00:43:10,528 --> 00:43:12,699
DJ Khaled is the king
of the beats.

1088
00:43:14,666 --> 00:43:17,534
You know, like the...
Beat King, 'cause he's the...

1089
00:43:17,536 --> 00:43:19,536
Oh, honey, that was...
we didn't like that at all.

1090
00:43:19,538 --> 00:43:20,670
THEO: It's awful. I know.

1091
00:43:20,672 --> 00:43:24,273
Um, can you explain this,
uh, terrifying situation?

1092
00:43:24,275 --> 00:43:26,409
What? What, my... the face?
Not your face.

1093
00:43:26,411 --> 00:43:28,612
Um, the thing behind you.
Oh, the apiary.

1094
00:43:28,614 --> 00:43:31,815
Hmm. Oh, right, yeah, no, this
is, uh, a portable beehive

1095
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:34,550
that Sunburst uses
to harvest natural honey.

1096
00:43:34,552 --> 00:43:36,619
Doesn't seem like a disaster
waiting to happen.

1097
00:43:36,621 --> 00:43:37,521
Yes, it can be.

1098
00:43:37,523 --> 00:43:39,623

I got to show you something.

I'll bring her right back.

1103
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:46,162
Oh... yeah, just her.

1104
00:43:46,164 --> 00:43:47,496
Just borrow her for a second.

1105
00:43:47,498 --> 00:43:48,532
Whatever.

1106
00:43:48,534 --> 00:43:51,300

00:54:37,481 --> 00:54:40,152
Of course.

1380
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:42,952
Don't hide your feelings
from me.

1381
00:54:42,954 --> 00:54:45,021
We're like sisters, Aubrey.
(CHUCKLES)

1382
00:54:45,023 --> 00:54:48,090
It is "Aubrey," isn't it?

1383
00:54:48,092 --> 00:54:51,193
Mm-hmm.

1384
00:54:51,195 --> 00:54:53,963
Well, to be totally honest,
my Dad was supposed to come

1385
00:54:53,965 --> 00:54:55,363
to see us perform tomorrow,

1386
00:54:55,365 --> 00:54:57,166
and I heard
that he can't make it.

1387
00:54:57,168 --> 00:54:59,836
And he's never actually
heard me sing with the Bellas,

1388
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:02,204
and now maybe
he never will, so...

1389
00:55:02,206 --> 00:55:04,240
Dad? He's here!

1390
00:55:04,242 --> 00:55:05,742
What? Where?

1391
00:55:05,744 --> 00:55:09,211
That's my dad's yacht,
the <i>Fat Dingo Bitch.</i>

1392
00:55:09,213 --> 00:55:11,213
That's what he always
used to call my mum.

1393
00:55:11,215 --> 00:55:13,249
Oh.
Obviously, he's come

1394
00:55:13,251 --> 00:55:15,985
to see me perform
in our last ever show!

1395
00:55:15,987 --> 00:55:17,452
My Dad came!

1396
00:55:17,454 --> 00:55:19,354
Must feel aca-amazing.

1397
00:55:19,356 --> 00:55:21,990
(YELLING EXCITEDLY)

1398

(MUSIC PLAYING)

1399
00:55:25,163 --> 00:55:27,195
CYNTHIA ROSE: They gotta be
close to making a decision.

1400
00:55:27,197 --> 00:55:29,264
They film the special
with DJ Khaled tomorrow.

1401
00:55:29,266 --> 00:55:31,266
And he needs an opening act.

1402
00:55:31,268 --> 00:55:34,103
EMILY: Oh, look who it is.

1403
00:55:34,105 --> 00:55:37,273
Did you guys see the way
they got off stage yesterday?

1404
00:55:37,275 --> 00:55:38,907
They literally went out
of their way

1405
00:55:38,909 --> 00:55:40,275
not to congratulate us.

1406
00:55:40,277 --> 00:55:42,914
They clearly just see us
as a threat.

1407
00:55:44,882 --> 00:55:46,849
Oh, shit!
Oh, my God.

1408
00:55:46,851 --> 00:55:48,083
You are so weird.
Wow. Sometimes.

1409
00:55:48,085 --> 00:55:50,186
That's not fair.
You seem very nice.

1410
00:55:50,188 --> 00:55:51,854
Can I borrow you for a second?

1411
00:55:51,856 --> 00:55:53,121
Yeah, great.
Yeah? Come on.

1412
00:55:53,123 --> 00:55:54,123
Great.
You want to hold hands?

1413
00:55:54,125 --> 00:55:55,124
Nope.
Cool.

1414
00:55:55,126 --> 00:55:56,224
Where are we going?

1415
00:55:56,226 --> 00:55:58,528
You remember when you
burnt down DJ Khaled's room?

1416
00:55:58,530 --> 00:55:59,929
No, that was not...
No?

1417
00:55:59,931 --> 00:56:01,097
I don't remember that.
Back in Spain?

1418
00:56:01,099 --> 00:56:02,430
No.
You were looking for Lenny,

1419
00:56:02,432 --> 00:56:04,032
hiding behind the bushes,
released the bees.

1420
00:56:04,034 --> 00:56:05,434
No, I think that...
that was my sister.

1421
00:56:05,436 --> 00:56:06,501
I hate her. What?

1422
00:56:06,503 --> 00:56:08,104
DJ Khaled wants to meet you.

1423
00:56:08,106 --> 00:56:11,043
Why?
Hey, boss.

1424
00:56:12,043 --> 00:56:14,043
Theo, my guy.

1425
00:56:14,045 --> 00:56:16,045
Magical ears.

1426
00:56:16,047 --> 00:56:17,916
Beca.
H-Hello.

1427
00:56:19,117 --> 00:56:21,050
How beautiful.
Oh, thank you.

1428
00:56:21,052 --> 00:56:22,851
So nice to meet you.
ASAP!

1429
00:56:22,853 --> 00:56:24,086
Need a drink for Beca, ASAP!

1430
00:56:24,088 --> 00:56:25,086
Have a seat.

1431
00:56:25,088 --> 00:56:26,289
Make yourself at home.

1432
00:56:26,291 --> 00:56:27,590
BECA: Oh, my God.

1433
00:56:27,592 --> 00:56:29,090
Thank you.
Just...

1434
00:56:29,092 --> 00:56:30,992
Yeah.
Here you go, mademoiselle.

1435
00:56:30,994 --> 00:56:32,260
Thank you.

1436
00:56:32,262 --> 00:56:34,063
I hope you like cherries.

1437
00:56:34,065 --> 00:56:36,199
Beca, have you been talking
to my guy, Theo?

1438
00:56:36,201 --> 00:56:37,400
Yeah, he talks a lot.

1439
00:56:37,402 --> 00:56:39,334
But I have no idea
what's going on.

1440
00:56:39,336 --> 00:56:41,204
He doesn't actually give me
that much information.

1441
00:56:41,206 --> 00:56:43,039
I thought maybe
you could break the news.

1442
00:56:43,041 --> 00:56:44,606
Congratulations.

1443
00:56:44,608 --> 00:56:46,041
(WHISPERS)
On what?

1444
00:56:46,043 --> 00:56:48,411
I want you to open up for me.

1445
00:56:48,413 --> 00:56:49,845
Tomorrow night.

1446
00:56:49,847 --> 00:56:51,546
Beca.

1447
00:56:51,548 --> 00:56:53,615
DJ Khaled.

1448
00:56:53,617 --> 00:56:55,320
Are you ready?

1449
00:56:58,088 --> 00:56:59,958
Seriously?
Yeah.

1450
00:57:00,992 --> 00:57:02,325
That is great.

1451
00:57:02,327 --> 00:57:04,894
You are not gonna
regret this. I...

1452
00:57:04,896 --> 00:57:07,963
The Bellas are gonna die.
Can I go tell them?

1453
00:57:07,965 --> 00:57:09,331
THEO: I-I think you misunderstood.

1454
00:57:09,333 --> 00:57:11,099
Uh, what DJ Khaled's
trying to say here

1455
00:57:11,101 --> 00:57:13,903
is that he doesn't want
the Bellas.

1456
00:57:13,905 --> 00:57:16,204
We want you.

1457
00:57:16,206 --> 00:57:17,539
What?
DJ KHALED: The other day,

1458
00:57:17,541 --> 00:57:20,208
when you was just
playing around with the loop

1459
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:21,943
and you was singing
and you was just...

1460
00:57:21,945 --> 00:57:25,347
I could tell that you was
just playing around, but...

1461
00:57:25,349 --> 00:57:29,217
I seen something,
I heard something,

1462
00:57:29,219 --> 00:57:32,021
then I felt something.

1463
00:57:32,023 --> 00:57:33,655
Amidst the chaos,
I went back in the room,

1464
00:57:33,657 --> 00:57:35,057
and I pulled your recording.

1465
00:57:35,059 --> 00:57:38,226
Why did you do that?

1466
00:57:38,228 --> 00:57:40,329
Because I wanted to know
what you could do on your own.

1467
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:43,365
Beca, it's time to go
to the next level.

1468
00:57:43,367 --> 00:57:45,034
I see it.

1469
00:57:45,036 --> 00:57:47,369
I'm DJ Khaled, aka Billy.

1470
00:57:47,371 --> 00:57:50,171
Who?
I know these things.

1471
00:57:50,173 --> 00:57:53,508
That is so amazing.

1472
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:55,211
That means the world to me,
honestly.

1473
00:57:55,213 --> 00:57:57,079
But I'm part of a group,

1474
00:57:57,081 --> 00:57:58,546
and we all have
something special.

1475
00:57:58,548 --> 00:58:01,150
I respect
that you love your group,

1476
00:58:01,152 --> 00:58:02,684
but it's time for you
to move on.

1477
00:58:02,686 --> 00:58:04,420
It's time for you to grow.

1478
00:58:04,422 --> 00:58:07,555
It's time for you to climb that
mountaintop and reach the top.

1479
00:58:07,557 --> 00:58:09,458
And the group
will be happy for you.

1480
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:11,594
What Khaled is trying
to say here is that

1481
00:58:11,596 --> 00:58:14,262
you've really gone as far
as you can with the girls.

1482
00:58:14,264 --> 00:58:16,565
It's time for you
to now flourish on your own.

1483
00:58:16,567 --> 00:58:19,434
Independent... ly.

1484
00:58:19,436 --> 00:58:21,103
DJ KHALED: These ain't opinions.

1485
00:58:21,105 --> 00:58:22,405
These are facts.

1486
00:58:22,407 --> 00:58:23,940
Yes.

1487
00:58:23,942 --> 00:58:25,474
Come with me a second.

1488
00:58:25,476 --> 00:58:26,708

00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:29,077
Listen, I... I know it's a lot

1490
00:58:29,079 --> 00:58:30,412
to take in, okay?
Uh, yeah.

1491
00:58:30,414 --> 00:58:32,048
The label is gonna
sign you, Beca.

1492
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:34,316
The label's gonna sign you.
They're gonna help you

1493
00:58:34,318 --> 00:58:36,719
develop your own material as a solo act.
Uh, yeah...

1494
00:58:36,721 --> 00:58:38,521
Th-This is very generous,

1495
00:58:38,523 --> 00:58:40,389
but we're talking
about my family.

1496
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:42,191
I'm-I'm... I'm not interested.
It's...

1497
00:58:42,193 --> 00:58:44,226
It's a tough decision. I get that.
No, it's not.

1498
00:58:44,228 --> 00:58:46,595
It is. It is.

1499
00:58:46,597 --> 00:58:49,597
It's a big opportunity for you.
All right?

1500
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:51,333
Look at me. Stop.

1501
00:58:51,335 --> 00:58:53,337
What are you doing?

1502
00:58:55,206 --> 00:58:57,039
Go home. Sleep on it.

1503
00:58:57,041 --> 00:58:58,407
You come back, and you tell me

1504
00:58:58,409 --> 00:59:01,510
what you want to do
in the morning, okay?

1505
00:59:01,512 --> 00:59:03,479
All right?

1506
00:59:03,481 --> 00:59:06,182
I'm... I really am sorry. I...

So proud of you.

1513
00:59:37,581 --> 00:59:39,215
Thanks, Dad.
How did you see it?

1514
00:59:39,217 --> 00:59:40,282
Were you on the base?

1515
00:59:40,284 --> 00:59:42,217
Oh, you know me.
I've got my ways.

1516
00:59:42,219 --> 00:59:44,653
What a note to go out on, eh?

1517

What do you say
we leave tonight?

1518
00:59:47,324 --> 00:59:50,392
I would, but tomorrow's, like,

1519
00:59:50,394 --> 00:59:52,661
the big televised event
with DJ Khaled,

1520
00:59:52,663 --> 00:59:55,130
and they're definitely gonna
pick the Bellas to perform.

1521
00:59:55,132 --> 00:59:57,566
So I need to be there
'cause my talent compensates

00:59:57,568 --> 01:00:00,269
for the weaker members
of the group, like Beca.

what was your favorite moment

Hey, you've been a very
naughty girl, Turnip Top!

1856
01:15:33,036 --> 01:15:34,468
He's going to jail
for a long time.

1857
01:15:34,470 --> 01:15:36,137
I'm gonna go meet them,
all right?

1858
01:15:36,139 --> 01:15:37,574
Okay.
Sit tight.

1859
01:15:38,641 --> 01:15:40,474
I have no idea
what just happened,

1860
01:15:40,476 --> 01:15:43,010
but if Khaled doesn't pick us
after all of that,

1861
01:15:43,012 --> 01:15:44,545
what are we doing
with our lives?

1862
01:15:44,547 --> 01:15:47,048
Right? I know.
Mm-hmm. Seriously.

1863
01:15:47,050 --> 01:15:48,349
Uh, I think Beca has something

1864
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:50,488
she'd like to share
with the group.

1865
01:15:51,555 --> 01:15:53,455
Um, thanks, Amy.

1866
01:15:53,457 --> 01:15:54,656
Uh, yeah.

1867
01:15:54,658 --> 01:15:58,226
I was gonna say something
earlier, but we were involved

1868
01:15:58,228 --> 01:16:00,260
in a hostage crisis,
so I just...

1869
01:16:00,262 --> 01:16:01,498
They picked her.

1870
01:16:02,631 --> 01:16:04,499
DJ Khaled and his team.

1871
01:16:04,501 --> 01:16:05,767
They didn't pick the Bellas.

1872
01:16:05,769 --> 01:16:07,634
They picked Beca.

1873
01:16:07,636 --> 01:16:09,704
So they... yeah,
so they only picked her.

1874
01:16:09,706 --> 01:16:13,040
Yeah, but I said no because
I feel exactly how you feel.

1875
01:16:13,042 --> 01:16:16,076
You guys are family, and you
don't walk away from family.

1876
01:16:16,078 --> 01:16:17,778
Don't you want to make music?

1877
01:16:17,780 --> 01:16:19,347
No, I guess, but...

1878
01:16:19,349 --> 01:16:22,017
Beca, you can't say no.
You've gotta do it.

1879
01:16:22,019 --> 01:16:24,318
Look, your real family
doesn't hold you back.

1880

They lift you up.

1881

saying something to that effect

1885

It's... I-I won't do it.
It's not important.

to be honest with you guys.

Every time I perform
in front of people,

1889
01:16:46,376 --> 01:16:48,543
I feel like I'm gonna puke.

1890
01:16:48,545 --> 01:16:50,812
And I don't have to anymore.

1891
01:16:50,814 --> 01:16:53,680
(CHUCKLING) I'm so happy.

1892
01:16:53,682 --> 01:16:55,817
Aw.
Yes!

1893
01:16:55,819 --> 01:16:57,552
No more puking.
Whew!

AUBREY: (CHUCKLING)
Yes.

1896
01:17:00,590 --> 01:17:02,690
You know what?
I think I might just...

1897
01:17:02,692 --> 01:17:06,628
I don't know, move to Mykonos
and become a doula.

1898
01:17:06,630 --> 01:17:09,164
A doula?
A birthing coach.

1899
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:11,199
You gonna coach babies?
Mm-hmm.

1900
01:17:11,201 --> 01:17:12,703
Yeah, I'll be like...

1901
01:17:14,136 --> 01:17:16,137
"Come here, little guy.
You can do it.

"There ain't really
nothing to it.

you can do it. Come on!"

CYNTHIA ROSE: Now that gay people

1905
01:17:21,545 --> 01:17:24,344
can serve in the military,
I'm-a join the Air Force

1906
01:17:24,346 --> 01:17:26,414
and let them pay
for my flight school.

1907
01:17:26,416 --> 01:17:30,384
I have my Abnormal Psych exam
coming up next week.

1908

But also, you're gonna
keep writing

1909
01:17:32,655 --> 01:17:36,257
so your life isn't filled
with crushing regret, right?

Yes.

1912
01:17:39,595 --> 01:17:41,662
would interfere
with my business, so...

1913
01:17:41,664 --> 01:17:44,833
Yeah, that little tiny
juice truck you work at.

1914
01:17:44,835 --> 01:17:46,233
The juice truck I own

1915
01:17:46,235 --> 01:17:48,469
and just secured capital
to franchise.

1916
01:17:48,471 --> 01:17:50,504
So... EMILY: Uh, what?
Oh! Cool.

1917
01:17:50,506 --> 01:17:53,641
I didn't tell you guys?
Congratulations.

1918
01:17:53,643 --> 01:17:55,212
Cool beans.

1919
01:17:56,212 --> 01:17:57,611

You guys? (CLEARS THROAT)

1925
01:18:10,260 --> 01:18:12,527
I think it's time that we go on

1926
01:18:12,529 --> 01:18:14,629
with the next chapter
of our lives.

1927
01:18:14,631 --> 01:18:18,465
It's time for us to move on.
You know?

1928
01:18:18,467 --> 01:18:20,802
I mean, we're always gonna
be there for each other

1929
01:18:20,804 --> 01:18:22,704
because we're family.

1930

And, I mean, I, for one,
am very ready.

I got the call that I got
into vet school.

1932
01:18:27,644 --> 01:18:29,744
You got in!
Yes, I got in. I know.

1933
01:18:29,746 --> 01:18:32,714
No way! Oh!
I got in. I'm a vet.

1934
01:18:32,716 --> 01:18:34,749
Congratulations!

1935
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:36,416
What about you, Ames?

1936
01:18:36,418 --> 01:18:38,218
You sure you're cool with this?

1937
01:18:38,220 --> 01:18:39,353
Are you kidding me?

1938
01:18:39,355 --> 01:18:41,589
I just found out
I got $180 million

1939
01:18:41,591 --> 01:18:43,790
to put into
"Fat Amy Winehouse."

1940
01:18:43,792 --> 01:18:44,659
What?
Yeah.

1941
01:18:44,661 --> 01:18:48,530
Whoa.
Wait, I could do more shows.

1942
01:18:48,532 --> 01:18:51,665
"Fat Amy Adams."
"Fat Amy Grant."

1943

Oh, that would be good
for Christmas.

1944
01:18:53,403 --> 01:18:54,501
Would be great.

Don't.

1946
01:18:57,340 --> 01:18:59,440
I swear to God,
don't make that face.

1947

If you cry, I'm gonna cry.
I swear.

1948
01:19:02,511 --> 01:19:04,278
I'm not gonna do this
with you today, so...

1949
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:05,546
I'm not doing it.
I hate that face.

1950
01:19:05,548 --> 01:19:07,315
I'm not.
Don't make that face.

1951
01:19:07,317 --> 01:19:08,883
Don't.
This is my regular face.

1952

You know how much I love you.

1953
01:19:10,353 --> 01:19:13,720
You just get out there,
and you crush it.

1954
01:19:13,722 --> 01:19:14,789
Okay?

1955
01:19:14,791 --> 01:19:16,558
You crush it so hard

1956
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:19,460
that your nips tingle a bit.

1957

Don't. Bring it in.

We should give her one.

I mean, it's so romantic here.

01:20:01,503 --> 01:20:02,970
I've never been to France.

1977
01:20:02,972 --> 01:20:04,472
I hope never to come back.

1978
01:20:04,474 --> 01:20:05,873
Oh, no, it's not
a place for you.

1979
01:20:05,875 --> 01:20:07,842
Oh, no, no.
There's no good people here.

No, no.

1981

01:20:33,537 --> 01:20:35,370
First of all, I want to thank

1992
01:20:35,372 --> 01:20:37,371
all the troops
for coming out here.

1993
01:20:37,373 --> 01:20:38,906
It's about you.

1994
01:20:38,908 --> 01:20:40,340
We salute you.
