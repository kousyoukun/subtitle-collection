Today's the day.
We're getting her today.

24
00:02:44,104 --> 00:02:45,237
Is your sound equipment
working? Because...

25
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:46,371
You don't worry
about what I'm doing.

26
00:02:46,373 --> 00:02:48,340
- Oh, my God. She's right there. I got her.
- Shh, shh.

27
00:02:48,342 --> 00:02:50,942
- Here, get in here.
- All right. Got it.

28
00:02:50,944 --> 00:02:52,778
They were world champions.

29
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,013
The winningest a cappella group
of all time.

30
00:02:55,015 --> 00:02:58,116
The Barden Bellas,
an unlikely group of not-men

31
00:02:58,118 --> 00:03:00,151
who somehow managed to win
at something

32
00:03:00,153 --> 00:03:01,821
that didn't have to do
with baking.

33
00:03:01,823 --> 00:03:03,255
- I can hear you guys.
- You know, girlie,

34
00:03:03,257 --> 00:03:05,191
you're this close to being
cut out of this d'aca'mentary.

35
00:03:05,193 --> 00:03:06,858
So close.
You're in the danger zone.

36
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,727
We have security,
and I carry mace.

37
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:12,665
We're gonna be clinging to you
like mom jeans to a camel toe.

38
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:14,166

Mm, mm, mm, mm, whoa.

47
00:03:31,284 --> 00:03:34,820
You produced the shit out
of his turd-burger.

48
00:03:34,822 --> 00:03:37,089
Thanks. I mean, it's better.

49
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:39,291
- Who's that singing?
- Oh, that's me, but we've got time

50
00:03:39,293 --> 00:03:41,260
to get a real singer.
I have a couple thoughts.

51
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:44,829
- I think it's very...
- Yo. Yo, can we turn this off?

52
00:03:44,831 --> 00:03:47,198
Pimp-Lo, bam, bam, bam.

53
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,735
I mean,
you have done it again.

54
00:03:50,737 --> 00:03:54,205
- "Bend Over" is so...
- So good.

55
00:03:54,207 --> 00:03:55,975
I feel like my ears
are hearing the future.

56
00:03:55,977 --> 00:03:57,342
- Club banger.
- Yeah, I hate it.

57
00:03:57,344 --> 00:03:58,443
I really hate it.

58
00:03:58,445 --> 00:04:00,046
I'm the artist,

59
00:04:00,048 --> 00:04:02,347
and this is my song,
and I feel like

60
00:04:02,349 --> 00:04:05,284
y'all should play my mix.

Yeah, um...
it's my job

70
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:25,236
to make you the best little
Pimp-Lo that you can be,

71
00:04:25,238 --> 00:04:28,207
and-and I want to get behind
"Bend Over."

72
00:04:28,209 --> 00:04:31,043
And, as your producer, I would
love it if you could trust me.

73
00:04:31,045 --> 00:04:33,378
I would love it if you leave
my track how it is.

74
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:36,115
I made your song great, man.

75
00:04:36,117 --> 00:04:37,750
I think what she means is,

76
00:04:37,752 --> 00:04:39,084
your song was always great.

77
00:04:39,086 --> 00:04:40,952
No, what I mean
is what you gave me

78
00:04:40,954 --> 00:04:42,454
- was a steaming pile of...
- Pimp-Lo!

79
00:04:42,456 --> 00:04:45,257
Okay. There's something
that you should know.

80
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:47,926
Uh, Beca...

81
00:04:47,928 --> 00:04:49,961
- is on her period.
- Wow.

82
00:04:49,963 --> 00:04:52,231
- Oh, it's shark week? Hot damn.
- Bum-bum.

83
00:04:52,233 --> 00:04:54,733
Y'all keepin' it one hundred.
That's my moms right there.

84
00:04:54,735 --> 00:04:55,668
- You know what it is.
- Mm-hmm.

85
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,902
- Still menstruating? Hmm.
- Okay. - Truth.

86
00:04:57,904 --> 00:05:00,873
If you could just
excuse us for a second.

87
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:01,940
What are you doing?

88
00:05:01,942 --> 00:05:03,341
How can you take his side?

89
00:05:03,343 --> 00:05:04,976
Sides? Well, we...

90
00:05:04,978 --> 00:05:06,411
Why are we always talking
about sides?

91
00:05:06,413 --> 00:05:08,313
Okay, it's our job, brah.

92
00:05:08,315 --> 00:05:09,414
We're producers.

93
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:12,384
We bring his vision to life.

94
00:05:12,386 --> 00:05:15,353
Damn! That's poppin'!

95
00:05:15,355 --> 00:05:18,392
Hey!

96
00:05:20,394 --> 00:05:21,860
I did it.

97
00:05:21,862 --> 00:05:23,495
I finally quit my job.

98
00:05:23,497 --> 00:05:26,865
And I'm free, I'm free.
I'm never going back

99
00:05:26,867 --> 00:05:28,466
to that job again.

100
00:05:28,468 --> 00:05:31,137
It's the best day of my life.
I mean, I can't be

101
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:32,404
a music producer
without integrity.

102
00:05:32,406 --> 00:05:33,938
What's up?

103
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,074
What?

104
00:05:35,076 --> 00:05:36,509
Wait. S-Something's wrong.

105
00:05:36,511 --> 00:05:39,010
Your face is more pinched
than normal.

106
00:05:39,012 --> 00:05:40,378
I-I finally did it.

107
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,514
You got back together
with Jesse?

108
00:05:42,516 --> 00:05:45,416
No! You know the long-distance
thing didn't work.

109
00:05:45,418 --> 00:05:48,887
He lives 3,000 miles away
with his girlfriend

110
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:50,255
- and their cat.
- Oh.

111
00:05:50,257 --> 00:05:52,358
He got over you much quicker
than what I thought.

112
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,060
- Oh, thank you, Amy.
- Much faster than Bumper,

113
00:05:55,062 --> 00:05:57,363
who is rightfully
still devastated.

114
00:05:57,365 --> 00:06:00,199
You know he got a tattoo
of me on his butt cheek?

115
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:04,269
So now, every time he wants
to see me, he's like...

116
00:06:04,271 --> 00:06:05,370
He's just...

117
00:06:05,372 --> 00:06:07,272
- Okay. Um...
- That made me dizzy.

118
00:06:07,274 --> 00:06:10,009
- Wait, what's up?
- I quit my job.

119
00:06:10,011 --> 00:06:12,243
- You got fired?
- Oh, come on.

120
00:06:12,245 --> 00:06:13,512
All right.
I-I didn't get fired.

121
00:06:13,514 --> 00:06:14,579
- I quit.
- Come here.

122
00:06:14,581 --> 00:06:16,382
You're kind of making it worse.

123
00:06:16,384 --> 00:06:18,384
Let this negative energy
be released!

124
00:06:18,386 --> 00:06:20,553
Seriously, open your legs.
It'll come out quicker.

125
00:06:20,555 --> 00:06:22,221
- No, no.
- It'll come out quicker,

126
00:06:22,223 --> 00:06:24,156
- the bad energy.
- Why do you do this stuff?

127
00:06:24,158 --> 00:06:25,457
- Okay, seriously.
- Why are you like this?

128
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:27,860
- You're gonna come back from this so fast.
- Mm.

129
00:06:27,862 --> 00:06:31,329
You know why? Because you have
an amazing best friend.

130
00:06:31,331 --> 00:06:32,498
Is that you?

131
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,598
Yeah.

132
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,067
- Okay.
- And also...

133
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:37,336
You need to pay the rent.

134
00:06:37,338 --> 00:06:38,904
Just a little.

135
00:06:38,906 --> 00:06:40,973
Uh, every month,
we have to do it. Ugh.

136
00:06:40,975 --> 00:06:42,041
Right.

137
00:06:42,043 --> 00:06:43,074
Yeah.

138
00:06:43,076 --> 00:06:44,476
You could get a job, you know.

139
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:46,611
Beca, you're in shock.

140
00:06:46,613 --> 00:06:48,346
You need something to eat.

141
00:06:48,348 --> 00:06:49,380
- Yeah. Just sit down.
- Oh.

142
00:06:49,382 --> 00:06:51,851
Not these, though.
They're mine.

143
00:06:51,853 --> 00:06:54,185
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Chloe!

144
00:06:54,187 --> 00:06:55,353
Why aren't you guys ready?

145
00:06:55,355 --> 00:06:57,356
Why are you wearing that?

146
00:06:57,358 --> 00:06:59,158
- What?
- Did you wear that to work?

147
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,428
- Yeah, underneath my scrubs.
- Well, sweetie, why?

148
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,396
Because it reminds me
I was special once.

149
00:07:04,398 --> 00:07:08,433
But also because tonight
is, you... you know...

150
00:07:08,435 --> 00:07:13,137
the Bellas reunion
at the Brooklyn Aquarium.

151
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:14,572
- Hello!
- That's tonight?

152
00:07:14,574 --> 00:07:16,207
- Yes. - Aw, yeah!
- You know what?

153
00:07:16,209 --> 00:07:17,276
I will take it.
I need a distraction anyway.

154
00:07:17,278 --> 00:07:20,411
- Yeah. Yes, you do! Whoo!
- I love it. Here we go!

155
00:07:20,413 --> 00:07:21,245
What happened?

156
00:07:21,247 --> 00:07:23,649
- She got fired today.
- No.

157
00:07:29,156 --> 00:07:31,156
- Hey, Stacie.
- Oh, my God!

158
00:07:31,158 --> 00:07:34,493
- Finally!
- Aw. Good to see you.

159
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:36,127
What's up, pitches?

160
00:07:38,132 --> 00:07:40,666
- I know, I know.
- Hi, Beca. - Oh!

161
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:41,567
I missed you guys so much.

162
00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:43,401
I can't wait for us
to sing together.

163
00:07:43,403 --> 00:07:44,103
I'm so excited.

164
00:07:44,105 --> 00:07:45,536
Hey, ladies.

165
00:07:45,538 --> 00:07:47,106
Let's crush this.

166
00:07:47,108 --> 00:07:49,341
- Hi. - Hello.
- Stacie!

167
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:50,175
Hi!

168
00:07:50,177 --> 00:07:51,644
Hey, Bellas.

169
00:07:51,646 --> 00:07:52,978
- Hi!
- Hi!

170
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,647
Thank you so much
for inviting us.

171
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:57,182
- Of course.
- So, what do you want us to sing tonight?

172
00:07:57,184 --> 00:07:58,517
A little "Who Run the World,"
some "Bulletproof"?

173
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,252
You didn't tell us
what the crowd was,

174
00:08:00,254 --> 00:08:01,687
- but I, um...
- What's she talking about?

175
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:03,389
I brought this, just in case.

176
00:08:03,391 --> 00:08:05,623
- Oh, God.
- Our voices are warm.

177
00:08:08,428 --> 00:08:12,298
Um, we didn't
invite you guys to sing.

178
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,365
We invited you to...

179
00:08:14,367 --> 00:08:17,469
- watch us sing.
- Watch.

180
00:08:17,471 --> 00:08:19,704
Aca-scuse me?

181
00:08:19,706 --> 00:08:22,173

were so busy with your...

Thanks.

You guys, I am so sorry.

264
00:11:42,842 --> 00:11:44,910
I realize I should not have
used the word "reunion."

265
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:47,613
I should have said that it was
an excuse to see each other.

266
00:11:47,615 --> 00:11:48,881
I really didn't think that out.

- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no.

You guys were so great.

269
00:11:51,384 --> 00:11:52,850
And this was
a really nice chance

270
00:11:52,852 --> 00:11:53,919
for us to get together.

271
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:55,153
Right, ladies?

272
00:11:55,155 --> 00:11:57,488
- Yeah, sure.
- Oh, yes.

273
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:59,257
Oh, yes, really great.

274
00:11:59,259 --> 00:12:00,559
- So great.
- Thank you so much.

275
00:12:00,561 --> 00:12:03,494
I was supposed to go
to my brother's wedding,

276
00:12:03,496 --> 00:12:05,930
- but this is nice, too.
- Aw.

277
00:12:05,932 --> 00:12:07,900
- Yeah.
- Bellas, a toast.

278
00:12:07,902 --> 00:12:10,169
- There!
- Toast! Yay!

279
00:12:10,171 --> 00:12:11,536
To the most amazing

280
00:12:11,538 --> 00:12:14,339
group of women
I have ever known.

281
00:12:14,341 --> 00:12:16,374
I would do anything

282
00:12:16,376 --> 00:12:17,943
to sing with you guys again.

283
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,810
Anything!

284
00:12:19,812 --> 00:12:23,315
I mean, really,
I could just crap myself!

285
00:12:23,317 --> 00:12:24,348
- Oh.
- Uh-uh.

286
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:27,552
Cheers.

287
00:12:27,554 --> 00:12:29,555
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I'm having a crazy idea.

288
00:12:29,557 --> 00:12:31,623
Okay, I've mentioned
that my dad is in the Army

289
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,525
and, like, basically killed
Osama bin Laden, right?

290
00:12:33,527 --> 00:12:35,560
Some new information
in that sentence, but okay.

291
00:12:35,562 --> 00:12:37,695
Well, what I mean is, he's
kind of a big deal in the Army.

292
00:12:37,697 --> 00:12:40,364
And every year, the USO
puts on this performance

293
00:12:40,366 --> 00:12:41,867
to entertain
and support the troops.

294
00:12:41,869 --> 00:12:44,770
And this year,
DJ Khaled is hosting.

295
00:12:44,772 --> 00:12:46,405
He's got, like,
a gazillion hit songs,

296
00:12:46,407 --> 00:12:48,239
and he's super famous.

297
00:12:48,241 --> 00:12:50,541
I saw him on a tax commercial.

298
00:12:50,543 --> 00:12:52,777
What if I could get us
an invite?

299
00:12:52,779 --> 00:12:54,445
To sing?

300
00:12:54,447 --> 00:12:56,848
No, to run military dark ops.

301
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:00,451
Yes, of course, to sing.

302
00:13:00,453 --> 00:13:02,521
Is there a competition?

303
00:13:02,523 --> 00:13:03,722
There should always be
a competition.

304
00:13:03,724 --> 00:13:06,892
Oh, um...
well, well, no, but...

305
00:13:06,894 --> 00:13:08,993
let's sing together again.

306
00:13:08,995 --> 00:13:11,430
And... and maybe
I'll see my dad.

307
00:13:11,432 --> 00:13:13,565
Or maybe I won't,
you know, because he has

308
00:13:13,567 --> 00:13:15,334
something really important
to do.

309
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,002
Or maybe I'll be
the most important thing

310
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:19,238
in his life this time.

311
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,341
Maybe.

312
00:13:22,976 --> 00:13:25,377
- Who's with me?
- Me. Mm-hmm.

313
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:29,013
Yeah. I suddenly have a lot
of free time, so hell yeah.

314
00:13:29,015 --> 00:13:31,349
Well, I just got
kicked out of flight school

315
00:13:31,351 --> 00:13:33,017
for killing 300 fake people.

316
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:35,954
- I hate fake people.
- I hate a fake bitch.

317
00:13:35,956 --> 00:13:38,824
Can you fly when
you're eight months pregnant?

318
00:13:38,826 --> 00:13:40,626
- What?
- No.

319
00:13:40,628 --> 00:13:41,493
Um...

320
00:13:41,495 --> 00:13:43,494
- Look.
- Oh...

321
00:13:43,496 --> 00:13:45,263
That's...
that's eight months pregnant?

322
00:13:45,265 --> 00:13:46,765
You guys didn't notice?

323
00:13:46,767 --> 00:13:48,267
- Well, congratulations.
- Oh, my God.

324
00:13:48,269 --> 00:13:50,701
Ah!

325
00:13:50,703 --> 00:13:52,771
- I mean, I'm so happy for you.
- Amazing! - Wow.

326
00:13:52,773 --> 00:13:54,406
Do you know who the father is?

327
00:13:54,408 --> 00:13:55,507
Eh.

328
00:13:55,509 --> 00:13:56,775
- Oh. - Oh.
- Congratulations.

329
00:13:56,777 --> 00:13:58,709
Happy accidents.

330
00:13:58,711 --> 00:14:01,345
Okay, well, Stacie's out.

331
00:14:01,347 --> 00:14:03,915
So I guess, Emily, you're in.

332
00:14:03,917 --> 00:14:06,050
- Oh, yeah. I'm in for sure.
- Yeah!

333
00:14:06,052 --> 00:14:07,786
Yay.

334
00:14:07,788 --> 00:14:10,656
- Was I not always in?
- Um...

335
00:14:10,658 --> 00:14:12,023
- Oh, no, no, no. Of course.
- Yes.

336
00:14:12,025 --> 00:14:13,057
Oh, cool. I... Okay.

337
00:14:13,059 --> 00:14:15,661

347
00:14:46,326 --> 00:14:47,959
Where'd you guys
even come from?

348
00:14:47,961 --> 00:14:49,627
A little town called
Persistence, sweet cheeks.

349
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:50,829
That's right.
Here, here's the thing.

00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,699
All-access passes.

352
00:14:53,701 --> 00:14:55,934
We're tall enough
for all the rides.

353
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:58,770
You can run,
but you cannot hide.

354

This d'aca'mentary
is happening!

355

We're gonna film
this whole thing.

00:15:01,908 --> 00:15:02,775
It's gonna be beautiful.

357
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:04,075
We're making a beautiful
d'aca'mentary.

358
00:15:04,077 --> 00:15:05,444
In fact, we gotta set up.

359

Where are we gonna
set up, John?

360
00:15:06,513 --> 00:15:07,512

Welcome to Spain, Bellas.

367
00:15:25,865 --> 00:15:27,598
A few important things
to note before we begin.

368
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,767
Grab your luggage.

369
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:31,837
All right, thank you.

370
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,972
You always want
to stay 25 feet...

371
00:15:39,011 --> 00:15:41,012
...choke.

372
00:15:41,014 --> 00:15:44,416
...very sharp. We do not
want you to impale yourself.

373
00:15:45,686 --> 00:15:47,953
I hope you all heard
each and every word,

374
00:15:47,955 --> 00:15:51,025
or else you might
very well end up dead.

375
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,626
Ladies, I'm messing with you.

376
00:15:54,628 --> 00:15:56,862
On behalf of the Department
of Defense, we would like

377
00:15:56,864 --> 00:15:59,164
to welcome you to
Naval Air Station Rota, Spain.

378
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,632
And a sincere thank-you
for coming out to entertain

379
00:16:01,634 --> 00:16:02,868
our troops and their families.

380
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,502
We're excited for this tour.

381
00:16:04,504 --> 00:16:06,103
My name's Chicago.
Over here to my left

382
00:16:06,105 --> 00:16:08,540
is Captain Bernie,
who we like to call Zeke.

383
00:16:08,542 --> 00:16:10,975
- Ladies.
- We're gonna be with you the whole tour

384
00:16:10,977 --> 00:16:12,844
- as your escorts and security details.
- Question.

385
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,881
Will we all be
showering together?

386
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:20,919
Uh, first up is a sound check.

387
00:16:20,921 --> 00:16:24,089
We'll have you back
to the hotel by 1430.

388
00:16:24,091 --> 00:16:25,656
Maybe hit the rain locker,

389
00:16:25,658 --> 00:16:28,526
back here for the big show
at 1700. Yeah.

390
00:16:28,528 --> 00:16:31,932
1700... is that,
like, later than the night?

391
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,065
It's 5:00.

392
00:16:34,067 --> 00:16:35,599
Okay. Whatever.

393
00:16:35,601 --> 00:16:37,902
- Okay... Yep.
- Question, question.

394
00:16:37,904 --> 00:16:39,938
Um, so this is the first base.

395
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:42,810
Will we be going to second base
with you guys?

396
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:46,777
And then,
maybe a few days later,

397
00:16:46,779 --> 00:16:48,747
we'll go to third base?

398
00:16:48,749 --> 00:16:50,848
That's a "no" for me, so...

399
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,184
Wait, what's after
the third base?

400
00:16:52,186 --> 00:16:54,151
Why don't we get you
to your first venue?

401
00:16:54,153 --> 00:16:55,653
Come on.

402
00:16:55,655 --> 00:16:57,823
All right, well, we are

403
00:16:57,825 --> 00:16:59,056
really excited
to have you here.

404
00:16:59,058 --> 00:17:00,691
Right now
we're in Hangar Three.

405
00:17:00,693 --> 00:17:02,727
This is where we keep
all of our helicopters.

406
00:17:02,729 --> 00:17:04,595
Of course, now we've got
the big stage

407
00:17:04,597 --> 00:17:06,096
built up for the tour.

408
00:17:06,098 --> 00:17:08,900
So, on the tour,
we've got three bands.

409
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:10,802
Over here, we got Saddle Up.

410
00:17:10,804 --> 00:17:13,572
This is Young Sparrow
and DJ Dragon Nutz.

411
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,707
And behind me is Evermoist.

412
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:17,174
Oh!

413
00:17:17,176 --> 00:17:19,577
And check it out.
DJ Khaled just rolled in.

414
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:20,778
Let's set the stage,
all right?

415
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,846
- Let's get ready before the...
- So we should turn around

416
00:17:21,848 --> 00:17:23,815
- and shoot into it, I think.
- ...the Bellas out.

417
00:17:23,817 --> 00:17:24,815
- Get the Bellas...
- Hey, guys.

418
00:17:24,817 --> 00:17:25,984
Come say hey to the new group.

419
00:17:25,986 --> 00:17:27,585
- Yo. - Hi.
- Oh.

420
00:17:27,587 --> 00:17:30,020
Hello. We're the Bellas,

421
00:17:30,022 --> 00:17:33,057
formerly of Barden University
and currently of life.

422
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:34,959
- Ladies.
- Howdy.

423
00:17:34,961 --> 00:17:36,161
- Hey. - Hey.
- Ladies, I want

424
00:17:36,163 --> 00:17:37,562
to give you
a little forewarning.

425
00:17:37,564 --> 00:17:39,029
My man's social anxiety,

426
00:17:39,031 --> 00:17:41,132
when he's not behind the
turntables, it's kind of crazy.

427
00:17:41,134 --> 00:17:44,001
- So be easy, all right?
- Hello. - Hi.

428
00:17:44,003 --> 00:17:45,636
♪ Hello ♪

429
00:17:45,638 --> 00:17:49,673
♪ Is it me
you're looking for? ♪

430
00:17:49,675 --> 00:17:51,809
Right on. I'm Calamity.

431
00:17:51,811 --> 00:17:54,211
This is Serenity,
Veracity and Charity.

432
00:17:54,213 --> 00:17:55,180
- Hi. - Hey.
- Hi.

433
00:17:55,182 --> 00:17:58,216
If I joined your group,
I could be Obesity.

434
00:17:59,185 --> 00:18:01,253
- Get it?
- Oh, if you're wondering,

435
00:18:01,255 --> 00:18:03,220
- our presence here has nothing to do with...
- Nothing.

436
00:18:03,222 --> 00:18:05,556
...the nationally televised
"Salute to the Troops" special

437
00:18:05,558 --> 00:18:08,593
where DJ Khaled is going to
pick one group to open for him

438
00:18:08,595 --> 00:18:09,760
at the end of this tour.

439
00:18:09,762 --> 00:18:11,863
That was a lot of exposition.

440
00:18:11,865 --> 00:18:14,032
So there is a competition.

441
00:18:14,034 --> 00:18:15,534
I knew it.

442
00:18:15,536 --> 00:18:17,969
- And so there is.
- Idiots!

443
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,036
What, do you think we

444
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:20,639
care about just watching
you guys?

445
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,172
It's a competition! Hello!

446
00:18:22,174 --> 00:18:24,609
You guys just sing
other people's songs, right?

447
00:18:24,611 --> 00:18:26,911
- Like a cover band.
- No, no, no, no.

448
00:18:26,913 --> 00:18:28,046
- No.
- Uh, no, no, no. Uh, well,

449
00:18:28,048 --> 00:18:31,115
actually, Emily writes
original songs for the Bellas.

450
00:18:31,117 --> 00:18:32,784
I mean, I don't really
do it anymore.

451
00:18:32,786 --> 00:18:34,286
- I kind of did that one, and then I...
- Hey.

452
00:18:34,288 --> 00:18:36,287
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
You with us or against us?

453
00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:38,789
And it was one of your dads
who gave you

454
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,324
the spot on the tour, right?

455
00:18:40,326 --> 00:18:42,326
- Oh, my God.
- Um...

456
00:18:42,328 --> 00:18:43,295
- Ooh...
- Guys, stop.

457
00:18:43,297 --> 00:18:44,796
They just don't like
sharing the spotlight,

458
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:45,863
so they're trying
to intimidate us.

459
00:18:45,865 --> 00:18:48,033
Let's just take the high road
and do what we do.

460
00:18:48,035 --> 00:18:49,301
You thinking what I'm thinking?

461
00:18:49,303 --> 00:18:49,934
What are you thinking?

462
00:18:49,936 --> 00:18:50,936
A riff-off.

463
00:18:50,938 --> 00:18:53,805
- That's not what I was thinking.
- A riff-off!

464
00:18:53,807 --> 00:18:56,141
Wait. Yes.
A riff-off! Yes!

465
00:18:56,143 --> 00:18:57,942
- What is a riff-off?
- Yeah.

466
00:18:57,944 --> 00:18:59,276
A riff-off is a little game

467
00:18:59,278 --> 00:19:01,813
that we like to play
to see who's better.

468
00:19:01,815 --> 00:19:03,782
- Mm-hmm.

and matched it
with the first word

497
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,066
of the new song,
but you stay on tempo,

498
00:20:29,068 --> 00:20:30,768
stay on beat,
stay on pitch and, of course,

499
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,804

00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,227
"Age wrinkles the body,

623
00:25:56,229 --> 00:25:58,763
but quitting
wrinkles the soul."

624
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:00,334
Hmm.

625
00:26:01,634 --> 00:26:05,268
- Three...
- How about those Bulls?

626
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:07,638
Gotta love those Cubs.

627
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,575
And the deep dish pizza,
'cause it's so...

628
00:26:11,577 --> 00:26:13,113
deep.

629
00:26:13,645 --> 00:26:14,746
Chicago.

630
00:26:14,748 --> 00:26:16,046
Right?

631
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:18,682
Yeah, I'm actually
from Georgia.

632
00:26:18,684 --> 00:26:19,750
Oh.

633
00:26:19,752 --> 00:26:21,151
So, what's your story?

634
00:26:21,153 --> 00:26:22,286
Why are you here?

635
00:26:22,288 --> 00:26:24,087
Oh, boy. Um...

636
00:26:24,089 --> 00:26:26,157
Long story short,
I was in the NG,

637
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,293
but my CO recommended me
for OCS after, uh, AIT.

638
00:26:29,295 --> 00:26:32,130
Then came OBC
and RTB where I, uh,

639
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:34,097
was the, uh, DG of my class.

640
00:26:34,099 --> 00:26:36,500
It's... I don't know.

641
00:26:36,502 --> 00:26:38,268
Sorry. Um...

642
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:40,037
I joined the National Guard.

643
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:41,538
They helped put me
through college.

644
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:44,409
I spent about
a year stationed in Kabul.

645
00:26:44,411 --> 00:26:47,511
Uh, actually overseeing
a canine unit over there.

646
00:26:47,513 --> 00:26:49,080
We trained German shepherds,

647
00:26:49,082 --> 00:26:50,782
we trained pit bulls...

648
00:26:50,784 --> 00:26:52,650
Dogs.

649
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:53,750
I love dogs.

650
00:26:53,752 --> 00:26:55,452
I love animals, in general.

651
00:26:55,454 --> 00:26:58,055
- Animals are cute.
- You're cute. I mean, what?

652
00:26:58,057 --> 00:27:00,123
- What about you?
- Me? Me.

653
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:01,292
Uh, shorter story...

654
00:27:01,294 --> 00:27:03,661
I was in a singing group
in college,

655
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:08,399
and then now I am still
in that same singing group,

656
00:27:08,401 --> 00:27:10,434
but not in college.

657
00:27:10,436 --> 00:27:11,701
- But you're committed.
- I am committed.

658
00:27:11,703 --> 00:27:13,171
- That's great.
- Yeah, I love commitment

659
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:14,505
- and being committed.
- Yeah.

660
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:16,440
- Not to, like, an asylum. Whoa.
- Right.

661
00:27:16,442 --> 00:27:17,842
Or, like, a hospital, like,
it's... I'm not saying...

662
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:19,576
- Yeah, no, I know.
- But, like... just, I like...

663
00:27:19,578 --> 00:27:21,578
I love love.
I love being committed to love.

664
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:24,414
Not to you, but to, like...
I love, um, like, oranges.

665
00:27:24,416 --> 00:27:25,650
- Oranges.
- I love...

666
00:27:25,652 --> 00:27:27,785
Hey. Uh, girls?

667
00:27:27,787 --> 00:27:29,453
- Hmm?
- We have separate rooms. We don't have to

668
00:27:29,455 --> 00:27:30,587
sleep on top
of each other anymore.

669
00:27:30,589 --> 00:27:32,722
- What?
- Hey, that's great.

670
00:27:32,724 --> 00:27:34,292
Um, not sexually.

671
00:27:34,294 --> 00:27:35,763
There was that one time.

672
00:27:47,406 --> 00:27:49,474
Stop being so loud.

673
00:27:49,476 --> 00:27:51,275
- Yeah. No, yeah.
- Oh, that's what I want.

674
00:27:51,277 --> 00:27:52,509
Uh, no,
that's the molasses one.

675
00:27:52,511 --> 00:27:54,211
No, you're not gonna
like that one.

676
00:27:54,213 --> 00:27:55,479
- This one.
- I don't want molasses.

677
00:27:55,481 --> 00:27:57,414
Okay, you guys,
so we've never

678
00:27:57,416 --> 00:27:59,382
competed against bands
that play actual instruments.

679
00:27:59,384 --> 00:28:00,517
What's the plan?

680
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:03,421
I really think we should just
stay true to ourselves,

681
00:28:03,423 --> 00:28:05,623
- and it will all figure itself out.
- Emily?

682
00:28:05,625 --> 00:28:08,226
- Mm-hmm.
- Please hear this in the best way possible.

683
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:09,893
You're a very stupid person.

684
00:28:09,895 --> 00:28:11,895
You know what?
Maybe it won't matter

685
00:28:11,897 --> 00:28:14,465
if we win or not, because
they will like us so much

686
00:28:14,467 --> 00:28:16,433
that they will invite us
to keep touring with them.

687
00:28:16,435 --> 00:28:18,302
And it won't matter
if I get into vet school

688
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:19,903
because we will be together
as a family,

689
00:28:19,905 --> 00:28:21,506
supporting each other.

690
00:28:21,508 --> 00:28:23,343
And really, isn't that
what it's all about?

691
00:28:24,374 --> 00:28:25,343
- Yes.
- Yes.

692
00:28:25,345 --> 00:28:26,878
Yeah, except for all families
break apart,

693
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,851
and the only person you can
ever truly rely on is yourself.

694
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:35,385
All right,
time to drop a smash.

695
00:28:35,387 --> 00:28:38,523
- What? - Oh, no, no, no.
- Whoo! - Wait.

696
00:28:38,525 --> 00:28:40,461
- Think it's a whole album.

You're English. Hi.

726
00:30:22,494 --> 00:30:24,894
That's right. I saw you do
the, uh, sound check,

727
00:30:24,896 --> 00:30:28,365
- um, thing that you guys...
- Yeah. The riff-off thing.

728
00:30:28,367 --> 00:30:29,600
- Riff-off.
- Yeah. I don't know why we

729
00:30:29,602 --> 00:30:30,834
keep challenging people
to those.

730
00:30:30,836 --> 00:30:32,370
We... we don't ever
actually win.

731
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:34,372
- Oh.
- Do you work for the USO?

732
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,440
Uh, no, I-I work for DJ Khaled.

733
00:30:36,442 --> 00:30:37,975
Sorry. I'm-I'm Theo.

734
00:30:37,977 --> 00:30:38,776
- Hi. I'm Beca.
- Hi.

735
00:30:38,778 --> 00:30:40,978
- Nice to meet you.
- How you doing?

736
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:41,778
Sorry, you are a...

737
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,413
- Oh, I'm a...
- Music executive?

738
00:30:43,415 --> 00:30:44,515
...music exec
at Khaled's label.

739
00:30:44,517 --> 00:30:45,749
- Really?
- Yeah.

740
00:30:45,751 --> 00:30:47,517
- What?
- No, I-I... I work

741
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:48,919
with music executives,
and you...

742
00:30:48,921 --> 00:30:50,888
they... they don't look
like you.

743
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,055
Oh.

744
00:30:52,057 --> 00:30:54,725
What... what do I look like?

745
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:55,625
A turtle.

746
00:30:55,627 --> 00:30:59,063
Well, that's in...
incredibly specific.

747
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:00,998
But, like, you literally
look just like that.

748
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,432
No, no. It's accurate.

749
00:31:02,434 --> 00:31:03,668
You said you work
with music execs.

750
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:06,937
Oh. Yeah. Um, no, I'm a...

751
00:31:06,939 --> 00:31:08,471
I'm a music producer.

752
00:31:08,473 --> 00:31:10,040
I'm sort of freelancing
right now.

753
00:31:10,042 --> 00:31:11,709
Oh, and I sing for fun.

754
00:31:11,711 --> 00:31:14,312
I'm interested to see
the Bellas in action.

755
00:31:14,314 --> 00:31:17,681
Yeah, maybe we'll even open
for DJ Khaled in the end.

756
00:31:17,683 --> 00:31:19,717
You don't think
you'll open for Khaled?

757
00:31:19,719 --> 00:31:21,951
Uh, no, I-I...
I didn't say that.

758
00:31:21,953 --> 00:31:24,421
Yeah, you did. You did.
You just said it before.

759
00:31:24,423 --> 00:31:25,690
You kind of implied it,
if anything.

760
00:31:25,692 --> 00:31:27,024
- Well, I just...
- I could just

761
00:31:27,026 --> 00:31:29,893
tell him that you sing
for fun, if you like.

762
00:31:29,895 --> 00:31:31,594
No, I-I was just trying to...
I-I'm-I'm...

763
00:31:31,596 --> 00:31:33,396
I'm gonna go now.
I'll see you later,

764
00:31:33,398 --> 00:31:34,565
but I'll be watching.

765
00:31:34,567 --> 00:31:35,935
- Okay.
- Good luck. See you.

766
00:31:37,569 --> 00:31:39,870
- What was that?
- That was so much eye contact.

They are Evermoist.

Evermoist?

779
00:32:22,048 --> 00:32:23,913
Who came up with that name?

780
00:32:23,915 --> 00:32:26,417
My bum crack's a bit dry.

781
00:32:26,419 --> 00:32:28,151
Does anyone have
an Evermoist towelette?

782
00:32:30,556 --> 00:32:33,524
My grandma's in a band
right now... Nevermoist.

783
00:32:33,526 --> 00:32:35,426

We are Evermoist.

810
00:34:21,132 --> 00:34:23,233
Oh, wow!

811
00:34:23,235 --> 00:34:25,635
Who doesn't want to see that
on "Salute the Troops"

812
00:34:25,637 --> 00:34:28,005
next week, huh? Keep it going.

Uh, we are Evermoist.

00:34:33,211 --> 00:34:34,744
And now,

817
00:34:34,746 --> 00:34:37,882
an a cappella group
with a few YouTube clicks.

818
00:34:37,884 --> 00:34:40,885
So, put your hands together
for the Bellas.

819
00:34:41,822 --> 00:34:45,155
The Bellas reunited
finally onstage.

820
00:34:45,157 --> 00:34:47,724
They're gonna rock these troops
with their mouth music.

821
00:34:47,726 --> 00:34:49,760
And, as predicted, Gail,

822
00:34:49,762 --> 00:34:51,729

Tough blow. What was that?

873
00:36:56,889 --> 00:36:58,655
That, my friend, was "Taps"

874
00:36:58,657 --> 00:36:59,956
from the back of the house.

875
00:36:59,958 --> 00:37:01,157
Salute, salute.
We have to salute.

876
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:02,959
Stand at attention.
This is "Taps."

877
00:37:02,961 --> 00:37:05,028
It's to honor fallen soldiers,

878
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:07,130
and tonight,
it's the fallen Bellas.

879
00:37:07,132 --> 00:37:10,034
Look at this. Those girls
don't even know what to do.

880
00:37:10,036 --> 00:37:11,769
They look like idiots.

881
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:13,170
This is the best thing
for the movie.

882
00:37:13,172 --> 00:37:15,275
It couldn't be better.

883
00:37:17,976 --> 00:37:19,909
Should we be considering
using instruments?

884
00:37:19,911 --> 00:37:21,445
Is that crazy?

885
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:23,280
Oh, that's so funny.

886
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:25,416
You know, I'm gonna pretend
that you didn't just say that

887
00:37:25,418 --> 00:37:26,516
so we can still be friends.

888
00:37:26,518 --> 00:37:29,253
If we had drums,
then we wouldn't need Lilly,

889
00:37:29,255 --> 00:37:31,021
and if we had bass,
then we wouldn't need me.

890
00:37:31,023 --> 00:37:31,889
And we're still not clear

891
00:37:31,891 --> 00:37:33,456
why Jessica and Ashley
are even here.

892
00:37:33,458 --> 00:37:35,191
D-Did they just say our names?

893
00:37:35,193 --> 00:37:36,793
Don't be stupid.

894
00:37:36,795 --> 00:37:38,461
You know what? I have an idea.

895
00:37:38,463 --> 00:37:41,298
We just need to show DJ Khaled
that we are different

896
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:44,467
and better than all
of those other bands, you know?

897
00:37:44,469 --> 00:37:45,869
I think we did great.

898
00:37:45,871 --> 00:37:48,137
I just think the horn
cut our vibe.

899
00:37:48,139 --> 00:37:50,273
True that.

900
00:37:50,275 --> 00:37:51,809
All right, ladies.
Pick up your tits.

901
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:53,043
We're going out.

902
00:37:53,045 --> 00:37:54,211
What do you mean, "going out"?

903
00:37:54,213 --> 00:37:55,311
What do you mean,
what do I mean?

904
00:37:55,313 --> 00:37:57,947
- We just sucked balls in front of DJ Khaled.
- Hmm?

905
00:37:57,949 --> 00:38:00,284
- Listening.
- He's staying at that fancy

906
00:38:00,286 --> 00:38:01,818
casino hotel
across the street, okay?

907
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,353
I say we all get up,
we get dressed,

908
00:38:03,355 --> 00:38:06,423
we go over there, and we show
him that we are not a joke.

909
00:38:06,425 --> 00:38:10,226
Emily, I can't believe

910
00:38:10,228 --> 00:38:13,796
that a half-decent idea
came out of your dumb mouth.

911
00:38:13,798 --> 00:38:15,199
- Thank you.
- Okay?

912
00:38:15,201 --> 00:38:17,233
- So let's get tarted up and...
- Tatted up?

913
00:38:17,235 --> 00:38:20,204
- Tarted. Yeah, yeah, tarted up.
- It sounds like "tatted up."

914
00:38:20,206 --> 00:38:22,039
- She means "tatted."
- She's the caramel tart.

915
00:38:22,041 --> 00:38:24,441
She's a chocolate tart.
You're the vanilla tart.

916
00:38:24,443 --> 00:38:26,242
Thanks, babe.

917
00:38:26,244 --> 00:38:28,244
Mm...

918
00:38:28,246 --> 00:38:31,115
- Oh, "tarted."
- Oh, "tarted." "Tarted."

919
00:38:31,117 --> 00:38:32,883
If it's easier,
we'll just say "slutty."

920
00:38:32,885 --> 00:38:33,950
- Okay, let's get slutty.
- We'll dress slutty.

921
00:38:33,952 --> 00:38:34,985
- Let's get slutty.
- Okay, great.

922
00:38:34,987 --> 00:38:35,985

Okay, ladies.

I think we should split up.
Divide and conquer.

933

I bet it all on 21.

Oh, okay, well,
do you happen to have...

945
00:39:36,447 --> 00:39:38,917
seven ATM machines?

946
00:39:39,818 --> 00:39:42,586
I'll stake her.

General Douglas.
What an honor.

- General.
- Good to see you.

951
00:39:54,166 --> 00:39:56,532
- There's that guy. Hide.
- What?

952
00:39:56,534 --> 00:39:58,467
Why are we hiding?

953
00:39:58,469 --> 00:40:00,103
I don't know.

954
00:40:00,105 --> 00:40:01,938
Dude, what is...

955
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,106
What is this about?

956
00:40:03,108 --> 00:40:04,376
What are you guys doing?

957
00:40:05,476 --> 00:40:06,610
Nothing.

958
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:08,612
Ain't that Mr. Eye Contact?

959
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:10,179
He knows Khaled, right?

960
00:40:10,181 --> 00:40:11,248
We should follow him.

961
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:13,316
Okay, legacy, come on.

962
00:40:13,318 --> 00:40:15,219
You guys, act normal, casual.
Here we go.

963
00:40:15,221 --> 00:40:17,153
- Great idea.
- <i>Patricia,</i>

964
00:40:17,155 --> 00:40:18,956
you know how worried
I've been about you?

965
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,090
You shouldn't have run away.

966
00:40:20,092 --> 00:40:21,624
You should've talked to me.

967
00:40:21,626 --> 00:40:26,195
About what, the C-4 explosives
I found in the cereal box?

968
00:40:26,197 --> 00:40:28,498
Or what about the time
you smuggled drugs

969
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,434
in Sir Bounce-a-lot
and I had to see him

970
00:40:30,436 --> 00:40:34,503
get torn apart by custom agents
right in front of me?

971
00:40:34,505 --> 00:40:37,507
Sweetheart,
it was my profession.

972
00:40:37,509 --> 00:40:39,376
What, being dodgy?

973
00:40:39,378 --> 00:40:41,411
Well, that's one word for it.

974
00:40:41,413 --> 00:40:44,648
I mean, yeah, I was a criminal,
but I'm different now.

975
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,083
How'd you even find me?

976
00:40:46,085 --> 00:40:47,217
Well, what do you mean?

977
00:40:47,219 --> 00:40:48,517
I've been in hiding.

978
00:40:48,519 --> 00:40:50,052
Ah, my darling girl,

979
00:40:50,054 --> 00:40:51,988
I've known where
you've been for years.

980
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:55,391
Uh, it's impossible for you
not to stand out in a crowd.

981
00:40:55,393 --> 00:40:57,159
Yeah, why do I have to be
so brilliant

982
00:40:57,161 --> 00:40:58,494
at every single thing I do?

983
00:40:58,496 --> 00:41:00,963
Here, look.
I've always kept this photo

984
00:41:00,965 --> 00:41:03,400
of you and me
close to my heart.

985
00:41:03,402 --> 00:41:06,103
We used to play together.
We used to sing together.

986
00:41:06,105 --> 00:41:07,436
We used to be a team.

987
00:41:07,438 --> 00:41:09,505
- None of this is happening, okay?
- But-but...

988

No "but, but, but." No!

00:41:11,043 --> 00:41:12,675
But... darling.

990

- Hey. Oh, what are you doing here?

1014
00:42:25,317 --> 00:42:27,516
- I was waiting for you.
- I don't... That's weird.

1015
00:42:27,518 --> 00:42:29,353
I saw you hiding
behind the bushes.

1016
00:42:29,355 --> 00:42:30,487
No, I don't think so.

1017
00:42:30,489 --> 00:42:32,255
This is a really popular
jumpsuit

1018
00:42:32,257 --> 00:42:33,356
and hairstyle,
so that wasn't...

1019
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:34,391
- Oh.
- You know what?

1020
00:42:34,393 --> 00:42:35,659
I see what's happened.

1021
00:42:35,661 --> 00:42:37,626
This is not my friend
Lenny's suite.

1022
00:42:37,628 --> 00:42:39,162
That's embarrassing.

1023
00:42:39,164 --> 00:42:40,496
Oh, no, it's, uh,
DJ Khaled's suite.

1024
00:42:40,498 --> 00:42:41,999
- Is it?
- Yeah.

1025
00:42:42,001 --> 00:42:43,499
Oh, I had no idea.

1026
00:42:43,501 --> 00:42:45,202
We're throwing a...
a little party for him,

1027
00:42:45,204 --> 00:42:46,570
if he decides to show.

1028
00:42:46,572 --> 00:42:48,170
You guys should hang out.
You want to hang out?

1029
00:42:48,172 --> 00:42:49,539
- Twist my arm. We'll do it.
- Yeah.

1030
00:42:49,541 --> 00:42:50,706
Well, let's go.
I'll give you a tour.

1031
00:42:50,708 --> 00:42:52,608
- Great. - Yeah.
- All right, come this way.

1032
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:55,644
Uh, Khaled, right now he's, uh,
into this kind of feng shui,

1033
00:42:55,646 --> 00:42:57,748
so he has a specific kind
of arrangement

1034
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:59,715
to maximize his chi.

1035
00:42:59,717 --> 00:43:03,119
And, oh, Sunburst here
is Khaled's juiceologist.

1036
00:43:03,121 --> 00:43:05,287
Ah, Theo, pardon my zesting.

1037
00:43:05,289 --> 00:43:06,456
Would you like a beet juice?

1038
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:07,758
Your glands look frustrated.

1039
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,126
In my country,

1040
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,526
beet juice was reserved
for the king.

1041
00:43:10,528 --> 00:43:12,699
DJ Khaled is the king
of the beats.

1042
00:43:14,666 --> 00:43:17,534
You know, like the...
Beat King, 'cause he's the...

1043
00:43:17,536 --> 00:43:19,536
Oh, honey, that was...
we didn't like that at all.

1044
00:43:19,538 --> 00:43:20,670
It's awful. I know.

1045
00:43:20,672 --> 00:43:24,273
Um, can you explain this,
uh, terrifying situation?

1046
00:43:24,275 --> 00:43:26,409
- What? What, my... the face?
- Not your face.

1047
00:43:26,411 --> 00:43:28,612
- Um, the thing behind you.
- Oh, the apiary.

1048
00:43:28,614 --> 00:43:31,815
- Hmm.
- Oh, right, yeah, no, this is, uh, a portable beehive

1049
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:34,550
that Sunburst uses
to harvest natural honey.

1050
00:43:34,552 --> 00:43:36,619
Doesn't seem like a disaster
waiting to happen.

1051
00:43:36,621 --> 00:43:37,521
Yes, it can be.

1052
00:43:37,523 --> 00:43:39,623
Oh, Beca,
I got to show you something.

1053
00:43:39,625 --> 00:43:40,791
You're gonna love this.

1054
00:43:40,793 --> 00:43:42,258
Sure.

1055
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:43,559
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1056
00:43:43,561 --> 00:43:45,162
- Let's do it.
- I'll bring her right back.

1057
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:46,162
Oh... yeah, just her.

1058
00:43:46,164 --> 00:43:47,496
Just borrow her for a second.

1059
00:43:47,498 --> 00:43:48,532
Whatever.

1060
00:43:48,534 --> 00:43:51,300
Ooh. Is that an AKG C-24?

1061
00:43:51,302 --> 00:43:53,135
Yes, it certainly is.

1062
00:43:53,137 --> 00:43:54,438
Incredibly rare.

1063
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,440
Madonna, Beyoncé, Joan Baez.

1064
00:43:56,442 --> 00:43:58,374
Oh, I'm happy for them.
That's nice.

1065
00:43:58,376 --> 00:44:00,543
Yeah,
the boss likes to be ready

1066
00:44:00,545 --> 00:44:02,512
for whenever inspiration
strikes him,

1067
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:04,414
- so we have this setup here.
- Sure.

1068
00:44:04,416 --> 00:44:07,184
Yeah, must be good to be
really, really, really rich.

1069
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:09,385
Yeah.

1070
00:44:09,387 --> 00:44:11,121
You want to give it a go?

1071
00:44:11,123 --> 00:44:12,289
- No.
- No?

1072
00:44:12,291 --> 00:44:14,590
Couldn't possibly.

1073
00:44:14,592 --> 00:44:16,525
Ooh.

1074
00:44:16,527 --> 00:44:17,760
We're coming to you live.

1075
00:44:17,762 --> 00:44:19,362
- Oh, that's nice.
- Oh, we should've recorded that.

1076
00:44:19,364 --> 00:44:20,563
Oh, she's a beaut.

1077
00:44:20,565 --> 00:44:22,331
- What's this?
- Oh, this is just...

1078

a little loop going.

- Oh, okay. I...

00:45:34,405 --> 00:45:35,771
- Yeah? I'll be right back.
- Do you want me to...

00:45:52,324 --> 00:45:53,923
I knew that song would get you.

1112
00:45:53,925 --> 00:45:55,291
- Whoo-hoo!
- Oh, yeah.

1113
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:58,494
That's my girl.

1114
00:45:58,496 --> 00:46:00,362
I can't wait.

1115
00:46:00,364 --> 00:46:01,965
We'll travel the world
in my yacht,

1116
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:05,601
stop at all your favorite
places... the Atlantic Ocean,

1117
00:46:05,603 --> 00:46:07,369
- the Pacific Ocean...
- That would be great!

1118
00:46:07,371 --> 00:46:09,773
But I'm in the middle
of a tour right now.

1119
00:46:09,775 --> 00:46:11,807
But that's perfect.
I'll finally be able

1120
00:46:11,809 --> 00:46:13,776
to see one
of your performances.

1121
00:46:13,778 --> 00:46:16,246
Dad, you've never come
to any of my performances.

1122
00:46:16,248 --> 00:46:19,583
Sweetheart, I've changed.

1123
00:46:19,585 --> 00:46:22,552
It's not the first time
I've heard that.

1124
00:46:22,554 --> 00:46:26,555
But you're still my little
Turnip Top, aren't you?

1125
00:46:26,557 --> 00:46:30,726
I promise I won't
screw it up this time.

1126
00:46:30,728 --> 00:46:32,996
General Posen and I
were wrapping up

1127
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:34,764
a, uh, clandestine operation.

1128
00:46:34,766 --> 00:46:37,867
In fact, I've just come
from our classified briefing.

1129
00:46:37,869 --> 00:46:40,670
Oh, my God, so you were just
with Aubrey's dad?

1130
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:42,472
He was so excited
to see your show.

1131
00:46:42,474 --> 00:46:45,411
It's just too bad
that he can't make it.

1132
00:46:46,378 --> 00:46:48,278
- Oh.
- Oh.

1133
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:49,813
Oh, that's okay.

1134
00:46:49,815 --> 00:46:51,748
- Yeah, it's-it's really okay.
- No, that's okay.

1135
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:53,682
- It's totally fine. You know, he's a busy man.
- Uh-huh.

1136
00:46:53,684 --> 00:46:55,684
- That's right.
- And my dad always said,

1137
00:46:55,686 --> 00:46:58,822
"Expect finite disappointment,
and remember,

1138
00:46:58,824 --> 00:47:00,624
there's always more
where that came from."

1139
00:47:00,626 --> 00:47:02,492
Oh, my God, Aubrey!

1140
00:47:14,405 --> 00:47:16,606
Someone open a window!

1141
00:47:16,608 --> 00:47:18,911
- What is wrong with this door?
- I don't know!

1142
00:47:20,911 --> 00:47:23,912
Stand down!

1143
00:47:23,914 --> 00:47:26,383

1146
00:47:37,628 --> 00:47:40,063
Checkmate, Bellas.

1147
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:42,400
Checkmate.

1148
00:47:48,706 --> 00:47:49,773
Oh, hey.

1149
00:47:49,775 --> 00:47:52,409
Heard you all really, uh,
lit it up last night.

1150
00:47:53,545 --> 00:47:54,943
That's a great joke.

1151
00:47:54,945 --> 00:47:56,679
- It's really funny.
- Like a phoenix

1152
00:47:56,681 --> 00:48:00,383
rising from the ashes,
only a really sad version

1153
00:48:00,385 --> 00:48:02,552
where there's no phoenix
and just ash.

1154
00:48:21,005 --> 00:48:24,106
Sorry, I forgot where we were
in the conversation.

1155
00:48:24,108 --> 00:48:27,711
Next time, when you're trying
to impress DJ Khaled,

1156
00:48:27,713 --> 00:48:29,845
try to have some dignity.

1157
00:48:29,847 --> 00:48:33,849
Uh, we never do anything
with dignity, so...

1158
00:48:33,851 --> 00:48:35,453
Hey, where'd you go last night?

1159
00:48:36,387 --> 00:48:37,720
What, uh, you mean

1160
00:48:37,722 --> 00:48:39,722
when you were burning down
the hotel?

1161
00:48:39,724 --> 00:48:40,990
Dude, where were you?

1162
00:48:40,992 --> 00:48:43,959
Okay. I was with my father,
all right?

1163
00:48:43,961 --> 00:48:45,595
Wait, your dad?

1164
00:48:45,597 --> 00:48:47,396
He's been trying
to track me down for years,

1165
00:48:47,398 --> 00:48:48,597
and last night, he found me.

1166
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:50,766
Why are you running from him?

1167
00:48:50,768 --> 00:48:52,702
I wish my dad
would pay attention to me.

1168
00:48:52,704 --> 00:48:55,838
Because my dad
wasn't a very nice man.

1169
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,708
So, when I was 18,
I had to run away,

1170
00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:01,610
which was a real bitch
because of the chafing.

1171
00:49:01,612 --> 00:49:04,613
And now he has found me,

1172
00:49:04,615 --> 00:49:07,751
and I don't know what to think.

1173
00:49:07,753 --> 00:49:11,554
I mean, I-I think that's
amazing, and so should you.

1174
00:49:11,556 --> 00:49:13,956
I mean, it-it's...
it's a crazy thing.

1175
00:49:13,958 --> 00:49:16,059
He's finally found you
after all these years?

1176
00:49:16,061 --> 00:49:18,427
Now you can rekindle
the relationship,

1177
00:49:18,429 --> 00:49:20,162
and-and it could be
even stronger than it was.

1178
00:49:20,164 --> 00:49:22,132
And maybe he was not
a very nice guy before,

1179
00:49:22,134 --> 00:49:24,032
but maybe he is now,
and maybe he's amazing

1180
00:49:24,034 --> 00:49:26,168
- and wonderful and he wants...
- Okay, Emily, you are so shrill

1181
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:27,670
- and inarticulate!
- No, no!

1182
00:49:29,141 --> 00:49:30,740
Hello? Oh, it's Stacie.

1183
00:49:30,742 --> 00:49:32,976
Stacie! Stacie's calling me
on FaceTime.

1184
00:49:32,978 --> 00:49:34,711
- You guys! Stop. Get over here.
- What, Stacie?

1185
00:49:34,713 --> 00:49:36,412
- Oh, hello?
- Wait. Right over here.

1186
00:49:36,414 --> 00:49:37,713
- Oh, hi, hi, hi.
- You guys! - Guys!

1187
00:49:37,715 --> 00:49:39,816
- Oh! - Hi.
- Stace!

1188
00:49:39,818 --> 00:49:41,950
- Where are you?
- Stacie, it's going terrible here.

1189
00:49:41,952 --> 00:49:43,653
Yeah, we getting our asses
handed to us.

1190
00:49:43,655 --> 00:49:46,923
Guys, I had the baby.

1191
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:49,525
- What?
- Aw.

1192
00:49:49,527 --> 00:49:50,592
He's so cute.

1193
00:49:50,594 --> 00:49:52,494
She's a girl.

1194
00:49:52,496 --> 00:49:53,829
Oh, okay, then average.

1195
00:49:53,831 --> 00:49:54,930
What's her name?

1196
00:49:54,932 --> 00:49:56,699
Baby Fat Amy
or Baby Fat Patricia.

1197
00:49:56,701 --> 00:49:58,635
- You can choose.
- No, no, listen.

1198
00:49:58,637 --> 00:49:59,936
I know I've always been
your favorite.

1199
00:49:59,938 --> 00:50:01,941
Guys.

1200
00:50:03,108 --> 00:50:04,706
I named her Bella.

1201
00:50:04,708 --> 00:50:06,041
Aw.

1202
00:50:06,043 --> 00:50:07,677
- See? - That is adorable.
- Oh, that's perfect.

1203
00:50:07,679 --> 00:50:09,179
- That... Okay.
- I love you guys.

1204
00:50:09,181 --> 00:50:11,680
- We love you. We love you so much.
- We miss you.

1205
00:50:11,682 --> 00:50:12,916
You guys.

1206
00:50:12,918 --> 00:50:15,517
She's so cute.

1207
00:50:15,519 --> 00:50:17,519
Guys, can we stop trying
to win this tour

1208
00:50:17,521 --> 00:50:18,954
and just sing together?

1209
00:50:18,956 --> 00:50:21,157
I mean, that's why
we're all here, right?

1210
00:50:21,159 --> 00:50:22,858
Yeah.

1211
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:25,094
But also, let's still try
and win this thing

1212
00:50:25,096 --> 00:50:27,963
because I don't know
how else to live.

Bellas! Make some noise

1276
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:06,222
What a fitting swan song
for the Barden Bellas.

1277
00:53:06,224 --> 00:53:08,124
Yes, and as these young women
approach 30

1278
00:53:08,126 --> 00:53:10,126
and cease to be of value
as human beings,

1279
00:53:10,128 --> 00:53:12,260
perhaps this
is the bittersweet memory

1280
00:53:12,262 --> 00:53:15,264
they will take
into the bar with them.

1281
00:53:29,079 --> 00:53:31,748
Okay,
welcome to the South of France.

1282
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:34,150
We wanted to do something
kind of special for you guys.

1283
00:53:34,152 --> 00:53:35,885
Wow.

1284
00:53:35,887 --> 00:53:37,753
This feels like a group date
on <i>The Bachelor.</i>

1285
00:53:37,755 --> 00:53:39,755
Oh, it's just so beautiful.

1286
00:53:39,757 --> 00:53:41,824
Yeah, thank you.

1287
00:53:41,826 --> 00:53:43,291
Not free.

1288
00:53:43,293 --> 00:53:44,793
Got it.

1289
00:53:44,795 --> 00:53:46,295
Hey.

1290
00:53:46,297 --> 00:53:51,300
Um, hey, I just wanted to say
thank you for... for this.

1291
00:53:51,302 --> 00:53:54,302
- Oh.
- And for looking out for us on this trip.

1292
00:53:54,304 --> 00:53:58,675
And protecting
the United States... always.

1293
00:53:58,677 --> 00:54:00,309
It's my pleasure.

1294
00:54:00,311 --> 00:54:01,778
Must be kind of lonely,

1295
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,278
always being away
from your family,

1296
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,313
- being in a different place.
- Yeah.

1297
00:54:05,315 --> 00:54:07,249
But being in the Army
is kind of like

1298
00:54:07,251 --> 00:54:09,052
having a second family,
you know.

1299
00:54:09,054 --> 00:54:11,287
Well, yeah, of course you know.

1300
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:13,923
I mean, you guys come together
for your tour,

1301
00:54:13,925 --> 00:54:15,458
and when it's over,
you go your separate ways.

1302
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:19,195
But you're always gonna
be there for each other, right?

1303
00:54:19,197 --> 00:54:23,166
I mean, you're never
really alone.

1304
00:54:23,168 --> 00:54:26,202
Wow, that was really cheesy.

1305
00:54:26,204 --> 00:54:27,436
No.

1306
00:54:27,438 --> 00:54:28,906
I liked it.

1307
00:54:34,945 --> 00:54:36,079
You okay?

1308
00:54:36,081 --> 00:54:37,479
Oh, yeah.

1309
00:54:37,481 --> 00:54:40,152
Of course.

1310
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:42,952
Don't hide your feelings
from me.

1311
00:54:42,954 --> 00:54:45,021
We're like sisters, Aubrey.

1312
00:54:45,023 --> 00:54:48,090
It is "Aubrey," isn't it?

1313
00:54:48,092 --> 00:54:51,193
Mm-hmm.

1314
00:54:51,195 --> 00:54:53,963
Well, to be totally honest,
my dad was supposed to come

1315
00:54:53,965 --> 00:54:55,363
to see us perform tomorrow,

1316
00:54:55,365 --> 00:54:57,166
and I heard
that he can't make it.

1317
00:54:57,168 --> 00:54:59,836
And he's never actually
heard me sing with the Bellas,

1318
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:02,204
and now maybe
he never will, so...

1319
00:55:02,206 --> 00:55:04,240
Dad? He's here!

1320
00:55:04,242 --> 00:55:05,742
What? Where?

1321
00:55:05,744 --> 00:55:09,211
That's my dad's yacht,
the <i>Fat Dingo Bitch.</i>

1322
00:55:09,213 --> 00:55:11,213
That's what he always
used to call my mum.

1323
00:55:11,215 --> 00:55:13,249
- Oh.
- Obviously, he's come

1324
00:55:13,251 --> 00:55:15,985
to see me perform
in our last ever show!

1325
00:55:15,987 --> 00:55:17,452
My dad came!

1326
00:55:17,454 --> 00:55:19,354
Must feel aca-amazing.

1327
00:55:25,163 --> 00:55:27,195
They gotta be
close to making a decision.

1328
00:55:27,197 --> 00:55:29,264
They film the special
with DJ Khaled tomorrow.

1329
00:55:29,266 --> 00:55:31,266
And he needs an opening act.

1330
00:55:31,268 --> 00:55:34,103
Oh, look who it is.

1331
00:55:34,105 --> 00:55:37,273
Did you guys see the way
they got off stage yesterday?

1332
00:55:37,275 --> 00:55:38,907
They literally went out
of their way

1333
00:55:38,909 --> 00:55:40,275
not to congratulate us.

1334
00:55:40,277 --> 00:55:42,914
They clearly just see us
as a threat.

1335
00:55:44,882 --> 00:55:46,849
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, my God.

1336
00:55:46,851 --> 00:55:48,083
- You are so weird.
- Wow. Sometimes.

1337
00:55:48,085 --> 00:55:50,186
That's not fair.
You seem very nice.

1338
00:55:50,188 --> 00:55:51,854
Can I borrow you for a second?

1339
00:55:51,856 --> 00:55:53,121
- Yeah, great.
- Yeah? Come on.

1340
00:55:53,123 --> 00:55:54,123
- Great.
- You want to hold hands?

1341
00:55:54,125 --> 00:55:55,124
- Nope.
- Cool.

1342
00:55:55,126 --> 00:55:56,224
Where are we going?

1343
00:55:56,226 --> 00:55:58,528
You remember when you
burnt down DJ Khaled's room?

1344
00:55:58,530 --> 00:55:59,929
- No, that was not...
- No?

1345
00:55:59,931 --> 00:56:01,097
- I don't remember that.
- Back in Spain?

1346
00:56:01,099 --> 00:56:02,430
- No.
- You were looking for Lenny,

1347
00:56:02,432 --> 00:56:04,032
hiding behind the bushes,
released the bees.

1348
00:56:04,034 --> 00:56:05,434
No, I think that...
that was my sister.

1349
00:56:05,436 --> 00:56:06,501
I hate her. What?

1350
00:56:06,503 --> 00:56:08,104
DJ Khaled wants to meet you.

1351
00:56:08,106 --> 00:56:11,043
- Why?
- Hey, boss.

1352
00:56:12,043 --> 00:56:14,043
Theo, my guy.

1353
00:56:14,045 --> 00:56:16,045
Magical ears.

1354
00:56:16,047 --> 00:56:17,916
- Beca.
- H-Hello.

1355
00:56:19,117 --> 00:56:21,050
- How beautiful.
- Oh, thank you.

1356
00:56:21,052 --> 00:56:22,851
- So nice to meet you.
- ASAP!

1357
00:56:22,853 --> 00:56:24,086
Need a drink for Beca, ASAP!

1358
00:56:24,088 --> 00:56:25,086
Have a seat.

1359
00:56:25,088 --> 00:56:26,289
Make yourself at home.

1360
00:56:26,291 --> 00:56:27,590
Oh, my God.

1361
00:56:27,592 --> 00:56:29,090
- Thank you.
- Just...

1362
00:56:29,092 --> 00:56:30,992
- Yeah.
- Here you go, mademoiselle.

1363
00:56:30,994 --> 00:56:32,260
Thank you.

1364
00:56:32,262 --> 00:56:34,063
I hope you like cherries.

1365
00:56:34,065 --> 00:56:36,199
Beca, have you been talking
to my guy, Theo?

1366
00:56:36,201 --> 00:56:37,400
Yeah, he talks a lot.

1367
00:56:37,402 --> 00:56:39,334
But I have no idea
what's going on.

1368
00:56:39,336 --> 00:56:41,204
He doesn't actually give me
that much information.

1369
00:56:41,206 --> 00:56:43,039
I thought maybe
you could break the news.

1370
00:56:43,041 --> 00:56:44,606
Congratulations.

1371
00:56:44,608 --> 00:56:46,041
On what?

1372
00:56:46,043 --> 00:56:48,411
I want you to open up for me.

1373
00:56:48,413 --> 00:56:49,845
Tomorrow night.

1374
00:56:49,847 --> 00:56:51,546
Beca.

1375
00:56:51,548 --> 00:56:53,615
DJ Khaled.

1376
00:56:53,617 --> 00:56:55,320
Are you ready?

1377
00:56:58,088 --> 00:56:59,958
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

1378
00:57:00,992 --> 00:57:02,325
That is great.

1379
00:57:02,327 --> 00:57:04,894
You are not gonna
regret this. I...

1380
00:57:04,896 --> 00:57:07,963
The Bellas are gonna die.
Can I go tell them?

1381
00:57:07,965 --> 00:57:09,331
I-I think you misunderstood.

1382
00:57:09,333 --> 00:57:11,099
Uh, what DJ Khaled's
trying to say here

1383
00:57:11,101 --> 00:57:13,903
is that he doesn't want
the Bellas.

1384
00:57:13,905 --> 00:57:16,204
We want you.

1385
00:57:16,206 --> 00:57:17,539
- What?
- The other day,

1386
00:57:17,541 --> 00:57:20,208
when you was just
playing around with the loop

1387
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:21,943
and you was singing
and you was just...

1388
00:57:21,945 --> 00:57:25,347
I could tell that you was
just playing around, but...

1389
00:57:25,349 --> 00:57:29,217
I seen something,
I heard something,

1390
00:57:29,219 --> 00:57:32,021
then I felt something.

1391
00:57:32,023 --> 00:57:33,655
Amidst the chaos,
I went back in the room,

1392
00:57:33,657 --> 00:57:35,057
and I pulled your recording.

1393
00:57:35,059 --> 00:57:38,226
Why did you do that?

1394
00:57:38,228 --> 00:57:40,329
Because I wanted to know
what you could do on your own.

1395
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:43,365
Beca, it's time to go
to the next level.

1396
00:57:43,367 --> 00:57:45,034
I see it.

1397
00:57:45,036 --> 00:57:47,369
I'm DJ Khaled, aka Billy.

1398
00:57:47,371 --> 00:57:50,171
- Who?
- I know these things.

1399
00:57:50,173 --> 00:57:53,508
That is so amazing.

1400
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:55,211
That means the world to me,
honestly.

1401
00:57:55,213 --> 00:57:57,079
But I'm part of a group,

1402
00:57:57,081 --> 00:57:58,546
and we all have
something special.

1403
00:57:58,548 --> 00:58:01,150
I respect
that you love your group,

1404
00:58:01,152 --> 00:58:02,684
but it's time for you
to move on.

1405
00:58:02,686 --> 00:58:04,420
It's time for you to grow.

1406
00:58:04,422 --> 00:58:07,555
It's time for you to climb that
mountaintop and reach the top.

1407
00:58:07,557 --> 00:58:09,458
And the group
will be happy for you.

1408
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:11,594
What Khaled is trying
to say here is that

1409
00:58:11,596 --> 00:58:14,262
you've really gone as far
as you can with the girls.

1410
00:58:14,264 --> 00:58:16,565
It's time for you
to now flourish on your own.

1411
00:58:16,567 --> 00:58:19,434
Independent... ly.

1412
00:58:19,436 --> 00:58:21,103
These ain't opinions.

1413
00:58:21,105 --> 00:58:22,405
These are facts.

1414
00:58:22,407 --> 00:58:23,940
Yes.

1415
00:58:23,942 --> 00:58:25,474
Come with me a second.

1416
00:58:25,476 --> 00:58:26,708
Bless up.

1417
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:29,077
Listen, I... I know it's a lot

1418
00:58:29,079 --> 00:58:30,412
- to take in, okay?
- Uh, yeah.

1419
00:58:30,414 --> 00:58:32,048
The label is gonna
sign you, Beca.

1420
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:34,316
The label's gonna sign you.
They're gonna help you

1421
00:58:34,318 --> 00:58:36,719
- develop your own material as a solo act.
- Uh, yeah...

1422
00:58:36,721 --> 00:58:38,521
Th-This is very generous,

1423
00:58:38,523 --> 00:58:40,389
but we're talking
about my family.

1424
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:42,191
- I'm-I'm... I'm not interested.
- It's...

1425
00:58:42,193 --> 00:58:44,226
- It's a tough decision. I get that.
- No, it's not.

1426
00:58:44,228 --> 00:58:46,595
It is. It is.

1427
00:58:46,597 --> 00:58:49,597
It's a big opportunity for you.
All right?

1428
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:51,333
Look at me. Stop.

1429
00:58:51,335 --> 00:58:53,337
What are you doing?

1430
00:58:55,206 --> 00:58:57,039
Go home. Sleep on it.

1431
00:58:57,041 --> 00:58:58,407
You come back, and you tell me

1432
00:58:58,409 --> 00:59:01,510
what you want to do
in the morning, okay?

1433
00:59:01,512 --> 00:59:03,479
All right?

1434
00:59:03,481 --> 00:59:06,182
I'm... I really am sorry. I...

1435
00:59:31,108 --> 00:59:32,708
Whoo!

1436
00:59:32,710 --> 00:59:35,744
Your performance
was incredible, Patricia.

1437
00:59:35,746 --> 00:59:37,579
So proud of you.

1438
00:59:37,581 --> 00:59:39,215
Thanks, Dad.
How did you see it?

1439
00:59:39,217 --> 00:59:40,282
Were you on the base?

1440
00:59:40,284 --> 00:59:42,217
Oh, you know me.
I've got my ways.

1441
00:59:42,219 --> 00:59:44,653
What a note to go out on, eh?

1442
00:59:44,655 --> 00:59:47,322
What do you say
we leave tonight?

1443
00:59:47,324 --> 00:59:50,392
I would, but tomorrow's, like,

1444
00:59:50,394 --> 00:59:52,661
the big televised event
with DJ Khaled,

1445
00:59:52,663 --> 00:59:55,130
and they're definitely gonna
pick the Bellas to perform.

1446
00:59:55,132 --> 00:59:57,566
So I need to be there
'cause my talent compensates

1447
00:59:57,568 --> 01:00:00,269
for the weaker members
of the group, like Beca.

1448
01:00:00,271 --> 01:00:01,570
Tomorrow it is.

1449
01:00:01,572 --> 01:00:04,305
And you can go
wherever you want to go.

1450
01:00:04,307 --> 01:00:06,041
Urban Outfitters?

1451
01:00:07,311 --> 01:00:09,677
You gotta think bigger,
Sunshine.

1452
01:00:09,679 --> 01:00:11,414
A Caribbean tour.

1453
01:00:11,416 --> 01:00:13,249
Have you ever been
to Martinique?

1454
01:00:13,251 --> 01:00:16,684
Or the, uh...
the Cayman Islands?

1455
01:00:16,686 --> 01:00:19,255
- The Cayman Islands?
- Oh, they're beautiful,

1456
01:00:19,257 --> 01:00:21,824
just like my little girl.

1457
01:00:21,826 --> 01:00:23,825
Uh-huh. Right.

1458
01:00:23,827 --> 01:00:25,293
Dad, let me ask you...

1459
01:00:25,295 --> 01:00:26,795
what was your favorite moment
of the show?

1460
01:00:26,797 --> 01:00:29,432
Well, there were too many
moments of greatness

1461
01:00:29,434 --> 01:00:31,233
from which to choose.

1462
01:00:31,235 --> 01:00:33,269
'Cause my favorite part
was the bit

1463
01:00:33,271 --> 01:00:34,570
where I sang that duet
with Beca,

1464
01:00:34,572 --> 01:00:36,472
and then was on the top
of the pyramid.

1465
01:00:36,474 --> 01:00:38,407
Oh, yeah.

1466
01:00:38,409 --> 01:00:40,376
Yeah, you were wonderful
in that part.

1467
01:00:40,378 --> 01:00:42,445
God! There was no pyramid!

1468
01:00:42,447 --> 01:00:44,512
And as if I'd be the top.

1469
01:00:44,514 --> 01:00:47,516
And I know exactly
what's in the Cayman Islands.

1470
01:00:47,518 --> 01:00:49,751
Yeah, I do.
That bank account

1471
01:00:49,753 --> 01:00:51,854
that Mum set up for me
on my 13th birthday.

1472
01:00:51,856 --> 01:00:54,757
She said it was just a bit
of an allowance, but...

1473
01:00:54,759 --> 01:00:58,461
I know she didn't want me
to ever need your dirty money.

1474
01:00:58,463 --> 01:01:01,396
How much is even in it anyway?

1475
01:01:01,398 --> 01:01:04,568
$180 million, give or take.

1476
01:01:06,237 --> 01:01:09,737
When am I gonna learn...

1477
01:01:09,739 --> 01:01:11,675
to open my mail?!

1478
01:01:13,878 --> 01:01:15,878
I'm done with you, Dad.

1479
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:17,847
Forever.

1480
01:01:17,849 --> 01:01:20,548
No, no, you're not.

1481
01:01:20,550 --> 01:01:23,351
We are done
when I get the money.

1482
01:01:23,353 --> 01:01:25,454
Amy?

1483
01:01:25,456 --> 01:01:27,389
Is this man bothering you?

1484
01:01:27,391 --> 01:01:29,391
- Yes, he is. Yeah.
- Yeah.

1485
01:01:29,393 --> 01:01:31,793
Sir, step away from the Bella.

1486
01:01:31,795 --> 01:01:35,764
Patricia, all my accounts
are frozen.

1487
01:01:35,766 --> 01:01:38,633
Good-bye, Fergus.

1488
01:01:38,635 --> 01:01:42,403
I tried to do this
the nice way, Patricia.

1489
01:01:42,405 --> 01:01:44,842
You remember that!

1490
01:01:46,610 --> 01:01:49,644
So, do you know how to do this?
How do you do this?

1491
01:01:49,646 --> 01:01:51,579
- Pour the water over the sugar, and smash...
- Like this?

1492
01:01:51,581 --> 01:01:52,780
Do you guys know where Beca is?

1493
01:01:52,782 --> 01:01:55,383
Theo must have said
something to her by now.

1494
01:01:55,385 --> 01:01:56,851
The show's literally tomorrow.

1495
01:01:56,853 --> 01:01:59,420
- I know.
- Guys, if Khaled picks us,

1496
01:01:59,422 --> 01:02:01,492
it'll be
our last show together.

1497
01:02:02,659 --> 01:02:04,827
Bellas, a toast.

1498
01:02:04,829 --> 01:02:07,262
- Ah, a Chloe toast.
- They say that...

1499
01:02:07,264 --> 01:02:09,465
home is where the heart is.

1500
01:02:09,467 --> 01:02:14,802
But you guys are the homes
that my heart lives in.

1501
01:02:14,804 --> 01:02:17,541
I am inside of all of you.

1502
01:02:19,342 --> 01:02:20,778
It feels so good.

1503
01:02:21,811 --> 01:02:24,280
- Cheers. - Cheers.
- Salud. - Cheers!

1504
01:02:24,282 --> 01:02:26,481
- Cheers!
- Guys, I love you so much.

1505
01:02:26,483 --> 01:02:28,483
- I feel like...
- Are you hallucinating?

1506
01:02:28,485 --> 01:02:31,387
Excuse me.
Uh, are you the Bellas?

1507
01:02:31,389 --> 01:02:33,289
- Yes.
- <i>Oui, monsieur.</i>

1508
01:02:33,291 --> 01:02:34,722
- <i>Sí.</i>
- My name is Henri.

1509
01:02:34,724 --> 01:02:37,525
Chicago sent me to take you
to the USO reception.

1510
01:02:37,527 --> 01:02:39,260
- Uh...
- Reception? - Huh?

1511
01:02:39,262 --> 01:02:41,530
Chicago never mentioned
any reception.

1512
01:02:41,532 --> 01:02:44,233
Something about
an announcement?

1513
01:02:44,235 --> 01:02:46,735
- Oh. We won. - What?
- Did we win?

1514
01:02:46,737 --> 01:02:48,537
Um, we need
to find our friends,

1515
01:02:48,539 --> 01:02:50,405
- Beca and Fat Amy.
- Great.

1516
01:02:50,407 --> 01:02:53,441
Oh, they are already there
with Chicago.

1517
01:02:53,443 --> 01:02:55,476
- Oh.
- Perfect.

1518
01:02:55,478 --> 01:02:58,347
Let's not keep this
handsome Frenchman waiting.

1519
01:02:58,349 --> 01:02:59,581
- Let's go. Shotgun!
- Ready?

1520
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:00,782
I guess we should go.
Let's go.

1521
01:03:00,784 --> 01:03:03,351
- Yeah. - Come on.
- Hey, let's go. - Henri?

1522
01:03:03,353 --> 01:03:05,653
- Oh, yeah. Whoo!
- Sounds like music.

1523
01:03:05,655 --> 01:03:08,824
I am Florencia.

The singing sounded very good.

01:03:47,498 --> 01:03:50,599
- Oh, <i>merci beaucoup, Henri.</i>
- Um, are we almost there?

1539
01:03:50,601 --> 01:03:52,767
Uh, yes. In fact...

1540
01:03:52,769 --> 01:03:54,869
'Cause it feels like
we've been driving forever.

1541
01:03:54,871 --> 01:03:56,472
...we are right here.

1542
01:03:56,474 --> 01:03:58,273
Yay! Oh, great!

1543
01:03:58,275 --> 01:03:59,775
I don't know.
I can't lift it.

1544
01:03:59,777 --> 01:04:01,577
I can't see.
I can't see anything.

1545
01:04:01,579 --> 01:04:03,012
Why won't the shade go up?
It's, like, stuck.

1546
01:04:03,014 --> 01:04:04,979
- It's so dark out there.
- Can you guys see out yours?

1547
01:04:04,981 --> 01:04:08,650
- No. - No, I can't see.
- Well, this don't seem right.

1548
01:04:08,652 --> 01:04:10,286
Maybe we...

1549
01:04:10,288 --> 01:04:11,420
- Whoa!
- Oh!

1550
01:04:11,422 --> 01:04:13,354
What was that?

1551
01:04:13,356 --> 01:04:15,860
I don't know. What was that?

1552
01:04:17,661 --> 01:04:19,295
What?

1553
01:04:19,297 --> 01:04:22,563
- What happened?
- Huh?

1554
01:04:22,565 --> 01:04:24,365
I don't know.

1555
01:04:24,367 --> 01:04:26,568
Hang on.
You guys, are we...

1556
01:04:26,570 --> 01:04:29,338
Are we floating?

1557
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:31,072
- Why would we be floating?
- What?

1558
01:04:34,878 --> 01:04:36,545
<i>Guys?</i>

1559
01:04:36,547 --> 01:04:37,845
You guys,
I can't open the door.

1560
01:04:37,847 --> 01:04:39,581
What? The door's not opening?

1561
01:04:39,583 --> 01:04:42,016
It's the old van-ferry
death-trap maneuver.

1562
01:04:42,018 --> 01:04:44,353
I should've seen it coming.

1563
01:04:44,355 --> 01:04:45,586
- Oh, God.
- What?

1564
01:04:45,588 --> 01:04:47,956
- Open it. Open the door.
- Help!

1565
01:04:47,958 --> 01:04:49,090
Does... does anybody's
cell phone work?

1566
01:04:49,092 --> 01:04:50,092
Where's my cell phone?

1567
01:04:50,094 --> 01:04:51,392
No service.

1568
01:04:51,394 --> 01:04:52,827
No service. There's nothing.

1569
01:04:52,829 --> 01:04:55,530
- That's so inconvenient.
- Hell's bells!

1570
01:04:55,532 --> 01:04:56,865
We could scream
on the count of three.

1571
01:04:56,867 --> 01:04:58,900
- Okay. One, two, three.
- One, two, three!

1572
01:04:58,902 --> 01:05:00,437
Help!

1573
01:05:08,545 --> 01:05:10,914
Sir Bounce-a-lot.

1574
01:05:28,699 --> 01:05:31,467
- I told you we're through!
- I know.

1575
01:05:31,469 --> 01:05:33,802
But there are some people here

1576
01:05:33,804 --> 01:05:36,637
who think you should
reconsider.

1577
01:05:36,639 --> 01:05:40,041
Amy!

1578
01:05:42,679 --> 01:05:43,979
How could you?

1579
01:05:43,981 --> 01:05:46,882
I swear to God,
if you hurt any one of them,

1580
01:05:46,884 --> 01:05:49,985
except for Jessica and Ashley,
I will kill you!

1581
01:05:49,987 --> 01:05:51,954
I don't want to hurt anyone,
Patricia.

1582
01:05:51,956 --> 01:05:54,923
The only one I wanted was you,
but you weren't with them,

1583
01:05:54,925 --> 01:05:56,492
were you?

1584
01:05:56,494 --> 01:05:58,159
Oh, well.

1585
01:05:58,161 --> 01:06:00,128
Plan B.

1586
01:06:00,130 --> 01:06:02,398
You have 30 minutes.

1587
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:03,865
Come to the boat,

1588
01:06:03,867 --> 01:06:06,568
or your friends
swim with the fishies.

1589
01:06:06,570 --> 01:06:09,037
And I think you know I mean it.

1590
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:10,873
Oh, I know you mean it.

1591
01:06:10,875 --> 01:06:12,740
Because you're
a terrible person

1592
01:06:12,742 --> 01:06:15,010
that does terrible things.

1593
01:06:15,012 --> 01:06:17,612
But there's one thing
you're forgetting, Dad.

1594
01:06:17,614 --> 01:06:18,981
I'm your daughter.

1595
01:06:18,983 --> 01:06:22,483
Your nightmare blood,
it runs through my veins!

1596
01:06:22,485 --> 01:06:24,186
Hey, Amy, um, I need to talk
to you about something.

1597
01:06:24,188 --> 01:06:26,789
- It's kind of important.
- Oh, yeah, just a sec.

1598
01:06:26,791 --> 01:06:28,423
- I'm on a call.
- Okay.

1599
01:06:28,425 --> 01:06:29,657
You think you're bad?

1600
01:06:29,659 --> 01:06:32,994
You have no idea
what I'm capable of.

1601
01:06:32,996 --> 01:06:35,063
I've graduated college.

1602
01:06:35,065 --> 01:06:36,764
I could do anything.

1603
01:06:36,766 --> 01:06:39,101
So say your prayers,

1604
01:06:39,103 --> 01:06:42,104
'cause Fat Amy is coming...

1605
01:06:42,106 --> 01:06:44,972
for you.

1606
01:06:44,974 --> 01:06:46,708
Now!

1607
01:06:49,679 --> 01:06:52,113
So...

1608
01:06:52,115 --> 01:06:54,650
which two of you

1609
01:06:54,652 --> 01:06:56,887
are Ashley and Jessica?

1610
01:06:58,489 --> 01:07:00,822
- Ah, shit.
- <i>Okay, so...</i>

1611
01:07:00,824 --> 01:07:01,891
I have kind of bad news.

1612
01:07:01,893 --> 01:07:04,159
Uh, and I know you're
gonna be fine. Uh, I know

1613
01:07:04,161 --> 01:07:06,030
- every-everybody's gonna be fine, but, like...
- Uh-huh.

1614
01:07:07,898 --> 01:07:09,231
Oh.

1615
01:07:09,233 --> 01:07:12,099
- Um, w-well...
- Yep.

1616
01:07:12,101 --> 01:07:14,101
We didn't get picked, man.
And you know what?

1617
01:07:14,103 --> 01:07:16,838
Like, screw them. It's not,
like, the whole story.

1618
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:19,842
There's... uh, uh, uh...

1619
01:07:19,844 --> 01:07:21,844
I don't know, I still feel
like I want to tell you

1620
01:07:21,846 --> 01:07:22,711
'cause I think that, like,

1621
01:07:22,713 --> 01:07:24,679
secrets are, like,
the worst, right?

1622
01:07:24,681 --> 01:07:25,847
So...

1623
01:07:25,849 --> 01:07:27,715
Yeah, it's the worst.

1624
01:07:27,717 --> 01:07:29,117
Let's go.

1625
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:30,586
Go where?

1626
01:07:30,588 --> 01:07:32,990
Don't worry.
We'll change in the cab.

1627
01:07:38,262 --> 01:07:39,795
Amy, what are we doing?

1628
01:07:39,797 --> 01:07:42,130
Why are we not calling
the police or Chicago?

1629
01:07:42,132 --> 01:07:44,099
No cops. There's no time.

1630
01:07:44,101 --> 01:07:46,635
And if my dad sees 'em,
he'll take off.

1631
01:07:46,637 --> 01:07:47,836
This is serious.

1632
01:07:47,838 --> 01:07:49,604
The Bellas
could really get hurt.

1633
01:07:49,606 --> 01:07:51,572
- Not on my watch.
- Amy, come on.

1634
01:07:51,574 --> 01:07:53,141
Look, I know my father.

1635
01:07:53,143 --> 01:07:54,742
I know his guys.

1636
01:07:54,744 --> 01:07:56,878
Some of them I know,
like, really well.

1637
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:59,248
And I know that boat.

1638
01:07:59,250 --> 01:08:01,148
We can do this.

1639
01:08:01,150 --> 01:08:03,117
Okay. What's the plan?

1640
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:05,987
First up, I need you
to pick up the pace.

1641
01:08:05,989 --> 01:08:07,891
This boat's not gonna
row itself.

1642
01:08:13,030 --> 01:08:15,030
Okay. That's the ladder
that'll take you

1643
01:08:15,032 --> 01:08:16,865
up to the main deck
where the Bellas are.

1644
01:08:16,867 --> 01:08:18,799
Do not let Fergus
hear what I'm doing below.

1645
01:08:18,801 --> 01:08:20,802
Okay, giant distraction
coming up.

1646
01:08:20,804 --> 01:08:23,237
- You sure about this?
- Have I ever let you down?

1647
01:08:23,239 --> 01:08:26,107
Dozens of examples
spring to mind, if I'm honest.

1648
01:08:26,109 --> 01:08:28,143
- What?
- Yeah, you're very unreliable.

1649
01:08:28,145 --> 01:08:30,144
It's, like, one of the
hallmarks of your personality.

1650
01:08:30,146 --> 01:08:32,748
I don't think we have time
to unpack that right now.

1651
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:35,049
Shh. I'll just see you up top.

1652
01:08:35,051 --> 01:08:36,684
Nobody's gonna die tonight,
right?

1653
01:08:36,686 --> 01:08:37,986
- Yeah.
- Right?

1654
01:08:37,988 --> 01:08:39,921
- Yeah.
- Well, that doesn't help.

1655
01:08:39,923 --> 01:08:41,557
- Okay.
- Okay, ready?

1656
01:08:41,559 --> 01:08:42,991
I've got my serious face
on now.

1657
01:08:42,993 --> 01:08:44,793
- Okay.
- It's time.

1658
01:08:44,795 --> 01:08:46,928
Let's do it.

1659
01:08:46,930 --> 01:08:50,566
Once we get the money,
we sail directly to Sydney.

1660
01:08:50,568 --> 01:08:52,800
Unless she doesn't show.

1661
01:08:52,802 --> 01:08:55,603
Then things get ugly.

1662
01:08:55,605 --> 01:08:57,205
Ten minutes, ladies.

1663
01:08:57,207 --> 01:08:59,677
Guys, you know
what we should do?

1664
01:09:00,877 --> 01:09:02,210
Where did you come from?

1665
01:09:02,212 --> 01:09:03,344
What?

1666
01:09:03,346 --> 01:09:04,679
You weren't here before.

1667
01:09:04,681 --> 01:09:06,682
I've been here the whole time.

1668
01:09:06,684 --> 01:09:09,119
I'm just small.

1669
01:09:14,725 --> 01:09:18,794
Just... if we only have
ten minutes left,

1670
01:09:18,796 --> 01:09:21,964
I say we spend it
doing something we love.

1671
01:09:21,966 --> 01:09:26,237
Let's go out like Bellas and...
and sing one more song.

1672
01:09:28,238 --> 01:09:31,039
You want to sing right now?

1673
01:09:31,041 --> 01:09:33,241
I think we should sing
one more song, though.

1674
01:09:33,243 --> 01:09:35,242
I don't know if I feel like singing.

1675
01:09:35,244 --> 01:09:38,949
Oh, my God. Guys, I just want
to sing so bad.

1676
01:09:40,684 --> 01:09:42,084
We really think you'll like it.

1677
01:09:42,086 --> 01:09:44,052
You want to entertain me?

1678
01:09:44,054 --> 01:09:46,120
Knock yourselves out.

1679
01:09:46,122 --> 01:09:47,856
Nine minutes.

1680
01:09:47,858 --> 01:09:49,857
Let's make it a loud one, guys.

1681
01:09:49,859 --> 01:09:51,759
You are terrible
at reading signals.

1682
01:09:51,761 --> 01:09:53,898

Mikhael, my former

1707
01:12:04,094 --> 01:12:06,193
jelly-wrestling coach,
slash babysitter.

1708
01:12:06,195 --> 01:12:08,295
Do you remember me?

1709
01:12:08,297 --> 01:12:12,099
How could I forget the girl
who gave me this?

1710
01:12:12,101 --> 01:12:14,468
You really shouldn't
have put me in a time-out.

1711
01:12:16,273 --> 01:12:18,342
Let's dance.

1712
01:12:22,845 --> 01:12:24,211
Why?

1713
01:12:33,157 --> 01:12:35,389
Whoa. Easy, now. Easy.

1714
01:12:35,391 --> 01:12:38,061
Easy, now.

1715
01:12:40,997 --> 01:12:42,563
Come on. Yeah?

1716
01:12:42,565 --> 01:12:44,366
What?

1717
01:13:11,295 --> 01:13:14,062
Nipple cripple!

1718
01:13:14,064 --> 01:13:16,097
Nipple cripple!

1719
01:13:16,099 --> 01:13:18,069
Take it.

1720
01:13:22,171 --> 01:13:25,009
This is way too much cardio.

1721
01:13:28,912 --> 01:13:30,414

Go, go, go!

1730
01:14:21,064 --> 01:14:22,630

1731
01:14:22,632 --> 01:14:24,665
Amy, come on! Amy!

1732
01:14:30,539 --> 01:14:32,542
Sweet baby Jesus!

1733
01:14:36,046 --> 01:14:37,611
Amy, let's go!

1734
01:14:42,586 --> 01:14:45,586
- Amy, come on!
- Patricia!

1735
01:14:45,588 --> 01:14:47,425
Stop her!

1736
01:14:58,435 --> 01:15:00,535
- Beca! Beca!
- Amy!

1737
01:15:00,537 --> 01:15:04,071
Hey, you've been a very
naughty girl, Turnip Top!

1738
01:15:04,073 --> 01:15:05,473
Amy! Amy!

1739
01:15:05,475 --> 01:15:07,308
Amy!

1740
01:15:12,682 --> 01:15:17,052
I rained hellfire!

1741
01:15:31,467 --> 01:15:33,034
The MPs arrested Amy's dad.

1742
01:15:33,036 --> 01:15:34,468
He's going to jail
for a long time.

1743
01:15:34,470 --> 01:15:36,137
I'm gonna go meet them,
all right?

1744
01:15:36,139 --> 01:15:37,574
- Okay.
- Sit tight.

1745
01:15:38,641 --> 01:15:40,474
I have no idea
what just happened,

1746
01:15:40,476 --> 01:15:43,010
but if Khaled doesn't pick us
after all of that,

1747
01:15:43,012 --> 01:15:44,545
what are we doing
with our lives?

1748
01:15:44,547 --> 01:15:47,048
- Right? - I know.
- Mm-hmm. - Seriously.

1749
01:15:47,050 --> 01:15:48,349
Uh, I think Beca has something

1750
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:50,488
she'd like to share
with the group.

1751
01:15:51,555 --> 01:15:53,455
Um, thanks, Amy.

1752
01:15:53,457 --> 01:15:54,656
Uh, yeah.

1753
01:15:54,658 --> 01:15:58,226
I was gonna say something
earlier, but we were involved

1754
01:15:58,228 --> 01:16:00,260
in a hostage crisis,
so I just...

1755
01:16:00,262 --> 01:16:01,498
They picked her.

1756
01:16:02,631 --> 01:16:04,499
DJ Khaled and his team.

1757
01:16:04,501 --> 01:16:05,767
They didn't pick the Bellas.

1758
01:16:05,769 --> 01:16:07,634
They picked Beca.

1759
01:16:07,636 --> 01:16:09,704
So they... yeah,
so they only picked her.

1760
01:16:09,706 --> 01:16:13,040
Yeah, but I said no because
I feel exactly how you feel.

1761
01:16:13,042 --> 01:16:16,076
You guys are family, and you
don't walk away from family.

1762
01:16:16,078 --> 01:16:17,778
Don't you want to make music?

1763
01:16:17,780 --> 01:16:19,347
No, I guess, but...

1764
01:16:19,349 --> 01:16:22,017
Beca, you can't say no.
You've gotta do it.

1765
01:16:22,019 --> 01:16:24,318
Look, your real family
doesn't hold you back.

1766
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:26,256
They lift you up.

1767
01:16:27,791 --> 01:16:30,290
Kind of feel like I've been
saying something to that effect

1768
01:16:30,292 --> 01:16:31,625
- the entire time.
- Oh, my God, Emily!

1769
01:16:31,627 --> 01:16:34,528
Smart people
are talking right now.

1770
01:16:34,530 --> 01:16:36,630
Aubrey, don't, please.

1771
01:16:36,632 --> 01:16:38,633
It's... I-I won't do it.
It's not important.

1772
01:16:38,635 --> 01:16:39,834
No, no, no.
It's-it's not that.

1773
01:16:39,836 --> 01:16:42,771
You know, I have
to be honest with you guys.

1774
01:16:42,773 --> 01:16:46,374
Every time I perform
in front of people,

1775
01:16:46,376 --> 01:16:48,543
I feel like I'm gonna puke.

1776
01:16:48,545 --> 01:16:50,812
And I don't have to anymore.

1777
01:16:50,814 --> 01:16:53,680
I'm so happy.

1778
01:16:53,682 --> 01:16:55,817
- Aw.
- Yes!

1779
01:16:55,819 --> 01:16:57,552
- No more puking.
- Whew!

1780
01:16:57,554 --> 01:16:59,320
- No more puke.
- No more puke.

1781
01:16:59,322 --> 01:17:00,588
Yes.

1782
01:17:00,590 --> 01:17:02,690
You know what?
I think I might just...

1783
01:17:02,692 --> 01:17:06,628
I don't know, move to Mykonos
and become a doula.

1784
01:17:06,630 --> 01:17:09,164
- A doula?
- A birthing coach.

1785
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:11,199
- You gonna coach babies?
- Mm-hmm.

1786
01:17:11,201 --> 01:17:12,703
Yeah, I'll be like...

1787
01:17:14,136 --> 01:17:16,137
"Come here, little guy.
You can do it.

1788
01:17:16,139 --> 01:17:17,604
"There ain't really
nothing to it.

1789
01:17:17,606 --> 01:17:19,773
You can do it,
you can do it. Come on!"

1790
01:17:19,775 --> 01:17:21,543
- Ah...
- Now that gay people

1791
01:17:21,545 --> 01:17:24,344
can serve in the military,
I'm-a join the Air Force

1792
01:17:24,346 --> 01:17:26,414
and let them pay
for my flight school.

1793
01:17:26,416 --> 01:17:30,384
I have my Abnormal Psych exam
coming up next week.

1794
01:17:30,386 --> 01:17:32,653
But also, you're gonna
keep writing

1795
01:17:32,655 --> 01:17:36,257
so your life isn't filled
with crushing regret, right?

1796
01:17:36,259 --> 01:17:38,159
- Yes.
- Good.

1797
01:17:38,161 --> 01:17:39,593
Well, guys, a music career

1798
01:17:39,595 --> 01:17:41,662
would interfere
with my business, so...

1799
01:17:41,664 --> 01:17:44,833
Yeah, that little tiny
juice truck you work at.

1800
01:17:44,835 --> 01:17:46,233
The juice truck I own

1801
01:17:46,235 --> 01:17:48,469
and just secured capital
to franchise.

1802
01:17:48,471 --> 01:17:50,504
- So... - Uh, what?
- Oh! - Cool.

1803
01:17:50,506 --> 01:17:53,641
- I didn't tell you guys?
- Congratulations.

1804
01:17:53,643 --> 01:17:55,212
Cool beans.

1805
01:17:56,212 --> 01:17:57,611
You talk?

1806
01:17:58,614 --> 01:18:01,215
Satan has finally left my body.

1807
01:18:01,217 --> 01:18:04,552
Hi. I'm Esther.

1808
01:18:04,554 --> 01:18:07,222
- Wha...?
- I have many questions.

1809
01:18:07,224 --> 01:18:10,258
You guys?

1810
01:18:10,260 --> 01:18:12,527
I think it's time that we go on

1811
01:18:12,529 --> 01:18:14,629
with the next chapter
of our lives.

1812
01:18:14,631 --> 01:18:18,465
It's time for us to move on.
You know?

1813
01:18:18,467 --> 01:18:20,802
I mean, we're always gonna
be there for each other

1814
01:18:20,804 --> 01:18:22,704
because we're family.

1815
01:18:22,706 --> 01:18:25,373
And, I mean, I, for one,
am very ready.

1816
01:18:25,375 --> 01:18:27,642
I got the call that I got
into vet school.

1817
01:18:27,644 --> 01:18:29,744
- You got in!
- Yes, I got in. I know.

1818
01:18:29,746 --> 01:18:32,714
- No way! - Oh!
- I got in. I'm a vet.

1819
01:18:32,716 --> 01:18:34,749
Congratulations!

1820
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:36,416
What about you, Ames?

1821
01:18:36,418 --> 01:18:38,218
You sure you're cool with this?

1822
01:18:38,220 --> 01:18:39,353
Are you kidding me?

1823
01:18:39,355 --> 01:18:41,589
I just found out
I got $180 million

1824
01:18:41,591 --> 01:18:43,790
to put into
"Fat Amy Winehouse."

1825
01:18:43,792 --> 01:18:44,659
- What?
- Yeah.

1826
01:18:44,661 --> 01:18:48,530
- Whoa.
- Wait, I could do more shows.

1827
01:18:48,532 --> 01:18:51,665
"Fat Amy Adams."
"Fat Amy Grant."

1828
01:18:51,667 --> 01:18:53,401
Oh, that would be good
for Christmas.

1829
01:18:53,403 --> 01:18:54,501
Would be great.

1830
01:18:54,503 --> 01:18:57,338
- Beca.
- Don't.

1831
01:18:57,340 --> 01:18:59,440
I swear to God,
don't make that face.

1832
01:18:59,442 --> 01:19:02,509
If you cry, I'm gonna cry.
I swear.

1833
01:19:02,511 --> 01:19:04,278
I'm not gonna do this
with you today, so...

1834
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:05,546
- I'm not doing it.
- I hate that face.

1835
01:19:05,548 --> 01:19:07,315
- I'm not.
- Don't make that face.

1836
01:19:07,317 --> 01:19:08,883
- Don't.
- This is my regular face.

1837
01:19:08,885 --> 01:19:10,351
You know how much I love you.

1838
01:19:10,353 --> 01:19:13,720
You just get out there,
and you crush it.

1839
01:19:13,722 --> 01:19:14,789
Okay?

1840
01:19:14,791 --> 01:19:16,558
You crush it so hard

1841
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:19,460
that your nips tingle a bit.

1842
01:19:19,462 --> 01:19:20,661
- She loves hugs.
- Don't. - Bring it in.

1843
01:19:20,663 --> 01:19:21,963
- That's not funny.
- We should give her one.

1844
01:19:21,965 --> 01:19:25,833
- I... - Yay!

of the USO Tour
in the South of France,

1855
01:19:49,492 --> 01:19:50,991
coming to you
from the Citadel.

1856
01:19:50,993 --> 01:19:54,595
What a gorgeous setting
here tonight under the stars.

1857
01:19:54,597 --> 01:19:56,363
Isn't this beautiful?
Doing a wonderful

1858
01:19:56,365 --> 01:19:58,465
musical presentation

1859
01:19:58,467 --> 01:19:59,701
In the South of France.

1860
01:19:59,703 --> 01:20:01,501
I mean, it's so romantic here.

1861
01:20:01,503 --> 01:20:02,970
I've never been to France.

1862
01:20:02,972 --> 01:20:04,472
I hope never to come back.

1863
01:20:04,474 --> 01:20:05,873
Oh, no, it's not
a place for you.

1864
01:20:05,875 --> 01:20:07,842
Oh, no, no.
There's no good people here.

1865
01:20:07,844 --> 01:20:08,875
No, no.

1866
01:20:08,877 --> 01:20:10,010
On your toes, folks.

1867
01:20:10,012 --> 01:20:12,416
We're on in ten.
First positions.

1868
01:20:17,820 --> 01:20:19,620
Ladies and gentlemen,

1869
01:20:19,622 --> 01:20:23,790
let's give it up for DJ Khaled!

1870
01:20:27,329 --> 01:20:30,365
When I say "fan,"
you say "love."

1871
01:20:30,367 --> 01:20:31,465
Fan!

1872
01:20:31,467 --> 01:20:32,834
- Love!
- Fan!

1873
01:20:32,836 --> 01:20:33,535
Love!

1874
01:20:33,537 --> 01:20:35,370
First of all, I want to thank

1875
01:20:35,372 --> 01:20:37,371
all the troops
for coming out here.

1876
01:20:37,373 --> 01:20:38,906
It's about you.

1877
01:20:38,908 --> 01:20:40,340
We salute you.

1878
01:20:40,342 --> 01:20:42,509
We praise you and thank you.

1879
01:20:42,511 --> 01:20:44,879
But tonight I have a surprise.

1880
01:20:44,881 --> 01:20:49,384
I'll be introducing you
to a new star.

1881
01:20:49,386 --> 01:20:50,617
A superstar.

1882
01:20:50,619 --> 01:20:53,687
Somebody that I have cosigned.

1883
01:20:53,689 --> 01:20:56,324
I introduce you to...

1884
01:20:56,326 --> 01:20:58,459
Beca Mitchell.

1885
01:21:01,064 --> 01:21:04,565
And here's Beca Mitchell
stepping onto the stage,

1886
01:21:04,567 --> 01:21:06,968
just as small as she was
the day she was born.

1887
01:21:06,970 --> 01:21:09,736
You know, we've been following
this little sprite-light lady

1888
01:21:09,738 --> 01:21:12,072
for, I don't know,
seven years now, I think.

1889
01:21:12,074 --> 01:21:13,808
We have been showing you

1890
01:21:13,810 --> 01:21:15,977
her new life
out in the real world,

1891
01:21:15,979 --> 01:21:18,612
where she's out to take
another perfectly good job

1892
01:21:18,614 --> 01:21:19,949
from an able-bodied man.

1893
