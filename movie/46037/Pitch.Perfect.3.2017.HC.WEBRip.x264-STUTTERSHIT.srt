They were world champions.

28
00:02:02,619 --> 00:02:04,849
The winningest a cappella group
of all time.

29
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:07,949
The Barden Bellas,
an unlikely group of not-men

who somehow managed to win
at something

00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:11,659

49
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:51,099
to get a real singer.
I have a couple thoughts.

50
00:02:51,109 --> 00:02:54,659

00:03:08,289 --> 00:03:09,879
I'm the artist,

58
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:12,179

and I feel like

59
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:15,119

to make you the best little
Pimp-Lo that you can be,

70
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:38,039
and-and I want to get behind
"Bend Over."

71
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:40,879
And, as your producer, I would
love it if you could trust me.

72
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:43,209
I would love it if you leave
my track how it is.

73
00:03:43,219 --> 00:03:45,949
I made your song great, man.

74
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,579
I think what she means is,

75
00:03:47,589 --> 00:03:48,919
your song was always great.

76
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:50,789
No, what I mean
is what you gave me

77
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,289
- was a steaming pile of...
- Pimp-Lo!

78
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:55,089
Okay. There's something
that you should know.

79
00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:57,759
Uh, Beca...

80
00:03:57,769 --> 00:03:59,789
- is on her period.
- Wow.

81
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:02,059
- Oh, it's shark week? Hot damn.
- Bum-bum.

82
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:04,569
Y'all keepin' it one hundred.
That's my moms right there.

83
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:05,499
- You know what it is.
- Mm-hmm.

84
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:07,739
- Still menstruating? Hmm.
- Okay. - Truth.

85
00:04:07,749 --> 00:04:10,709
If you could just
excuse us for a second.

86
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:11,769
What are you doing?

87
00:04:11,779 --> 00:04:13,169
How can you take his side?

88
00:04:13,179 --> 00:04:14,809
Sides? Well, we...

89
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:16,239
Why are we always talking
about sides?

90
00:04:16,249 --> 00:04:18,149
Okay, it's our job, brah.

91
00:04:18,159 --> 00:04:19,249
We're producers.

92
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,219
We bring his vision to life.

93
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:25,189
Damn! That's poppin'!

94
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,229
Hey!

95
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:31,689
I did it.

96
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:33,329
I finally quit my job.

97
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:36,699
And I'm free, I'm free.
I'm never going back

98
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:38,299
to that job again.

99
00:04:38,309 --> 00:04:40,969
It's the best day of my life.
I mean, I can't be

100
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:42,239
a music producer
without integrity.

101
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:43,769
What's up?

102
00:04:43,779 --> 00:04:44,909
What?

103
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:46,339
Wait. S-Something's wrong.

104
00:04:46,349 --> 00:04:48,839
Your face is more pinched
than normal.

105
00:04:48,849 --> 00:04:50,209
I-I finally did it.

106
00:04:50,219 --> 00:04:52,349
You got back together
with Jesse?

107
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:55,249
No! You know the long-distance
thing didn't work.

108
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:58,719
He lives 3,000 miles away
with his girlfriend

109
00:04:58,729 --> 00:05:00,089
- and their cat.
- Oh.

110
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:02,189
He got over you much quicker
than what I thought.

111
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:04,889
- Oh, thank you, Amy.
- Much faster than Bumper,

112
00:05:04,899 --> 00:05:07,199
who is rightfully
still devastated.

113
00:05:07,209 --> 00:05:10,029
You know he got a tattoo
of me on his butt cheek?

114
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:14,099
So now, every time he wants
to see me, he's like...

115
00:05:14,109 --> 00:05:15,199
He's just...

116
00:05:15,209 --> 00:05:17,099
- Okay. Um...
- That made me dizzy.

117
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:19,839
- Wait, what's up?
- I quit my job.

118
00:05:19,849 --> 00:05:22,069
- You got fired?
- Oh, come on.

119
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:23,339
All right.
I-I didn't get fired.

120
00:05:23,349 --> 00:05:24,409
- I quit.
- Come here.

121
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:26,209
You're kind of making it worse.

122
00:05:26,219 --> 00:05:28,219
Let this negative energy
be released!

123
00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:30,379
Seriously, open your legs.
It'll come out quicker.

124
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:32,049
- No, no.
- It'll come out quicker,

125
00:05:32,059 --> 00:05:33,989
- the bad energy.
- Why do you do this stuff?

126
00:05:33,999 --> 00:05:35,289
- Okay, seriously.
- Why are you like this?

127
00:05:35,299 --> 00:05:37,689
- You're gonna come back from this so fast.
- Mm.

128
00:05:37,699 --> 00:05:41,159
You know why? Because you have
an amazing best friend.

129
00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:42,329
Is that you?

130
00:05:42,339 --> 00:05:43,429
Yeah.

131
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:44,899
- Okay.
- And also...

132
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:47,169
You need to pay the rent.

133
00:05:47,179 --> 00:05:48,739
Just a little.

134
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:50,799
Uh, every month,
we have to do it. Ugh.

135
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:51,869
Right.

136
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:52,909
Yeah.

137
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,309
You could get a job, you know.

138
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:56,439
Beca, you're in shock.

139
00:05:56,449 --> 00:05:58,179
You need something to eat.

140
00:05:58,189 --> 00:05:59,209
- Yeah. Just sit down.
- Oh.

141
00:05:59,219 --> 00:06:01,679
Not these, though.
They're mine.

142
00:06:01,689 --> 00:06:04,019
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Chloe!

143
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:05,179
Why aren't you guys ready?

144
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:07,189
Why are you wearing that?

145
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,989
- What?
- Did you wear that to work?

146
00:06:08,999 --> 00:06:12,259
- Yeah, underneath my scrubs.
- Well, sweetie, why?

147
00:06:12,269 --> 00:06:14,229
Because it reminds me
I was special once.

148
00:06:14,239 --> 00:06:18,259
But also because tonight
is, you... you know...

149
00:06:18,269 --> 00:06:22,969
the Bellas reunion
at the Brooklyn Aquarium.

150
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:24,399
- Hello!
- That's tonight?

151
00:06:24,409 --> 00:06:26,039
- Aw, yeah!
- You know what?

152
00:06:26,049 --> 00:06:27,109
I will take it.
I need a distraction anyway.

153
00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:30,239
- Yeah. Yes, you do! Whoo!
- I love it. Here we go!

154
00:06:30,249 --> 00:06:31,079
What happened?

155
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:33,489
- She got fired today.
- No.

156
00:06:38,989 --> 00:06:40,989
- Hey, Stacie.
- Oh, my God!

157
00:06:40,999 --> 00:06:44,319
- Finally!
- Aw. Good to see you.

158
00:06:44,329 --> 00:06:45,959
What's up, pitches?

159
00:06:47,969 --> 00:06:50,499
- I know, I know.
- Hi, Beca. - Oh!

160
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:51,399
I missed you guys so much.

161
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:53,229
I can't wait for us
to sing together.

162
00:06:53,239 --> 00:06:53,929
I'm so excited.

163
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:55,369
Hey, ladies.

164
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:56,939
Let's crush this.

165
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:59,169
- Hi. - Hello.
- Stacie!

166
00:06:59,179 --> 00:06:59,999
Hi!

167
00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:01,469
Hey, Bellas.

168
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:02,809
- Hi!
- Hi!

169
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:04,479
Thank you so much
for inviting us.

170
00:07:04,489 --> 00:07:07,009
- Of course.
- So, what do you want us to sing tonight?

171
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:08,349
A little "Who Run the World,"
some "Bulletproof"?

172
00:07:08,359 --> 00:07:10,079
You didn't tell us
what the crowd was,

173
00:07:10,089 --> 00:07:11,519
- but I, um...
- What's she talking about?

174
00:07:11,529 --> 00:07:13,219
I brought this, just in case.

175
00:07:13,229 --> 00:07:15,459
- Oh, God.
- Our voices are warm.

176
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:22,129
Um, we didn't
invite you guys to sing.

177
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:24,189
We invited you to...

178
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:27,299

- Watch.

singing right now.

You guys, I am so sorry.

263
00:10:52,669 --> 00:10:54,729
I realize I should not have
used the word "reunion."

264
00:10:54,739 --> 00:10:57,439
I should have said that it was
an excuse to see each other.

265
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:58,709
I really didn't think that out.

266
00:10:58,719 --> 00:11:00,069
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no.

267

You guys were so great.

268
00:11:01,219 --> 00:11:02,669
And this was
a really nice chance

269
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:03,739
for us to get together.

270
00:11:03,749 --> 00:11:04,979
Right, ladies?

271
00:11:04,989 --> 00:11:07,309
- Yeah, sure.

272
00:11:07,319 --> 00:11:09,079
Oh, yes, really great.

273
00:11:09,089 --> 00:11:10,379
- So great.
- Thank you so much.

274
00:11:10,389 --> 00:11:13,319
I was supposed to go
to my brother's wedding,

275
00:11:13,329 --> 00:11:15,749
- but this is nice, too.
- Aw.

276
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:17,719
- Yeah.
- Bellas, a toast.

277
00:11:17,729 --> 00:11:19,989

279
00:11:21,369 --> 00:11:24,159
group of women
I have ever known.

280
00:11:24,169 --> 00:11:26,199
I would do anything

281
00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:27,769
to sing with you guys again.

282
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:29,629
Anything!

283
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:33,139
I mean, really,
I could just crap myself!

284
00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:34,169
- Oh.
- Uh-uh.

285
00:11:34,179 --> 00:11:37,379
Cheers.

286
00:11:37,389 --> 00:11:39,379
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I'm having a crazy idea.

287
00:11:39,389 --> 00:11:41,449
Okay, I've mentioned
that my dad is in the Army

288
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:43,349
and, like, basically killed
Osama bin Laden, right?

289
00:11:43,359 --> 00:11:45,379
Some new information
in that sentence, but okay.

290
00:11:45,389 --> 00:11:47,519
Well, what I mean is, he's
kind of a big deal in the Army.

291
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:50,189
And every year, the USO
puts on this performance

292
00:11:50,199 --> 00:11:51,689
to entertain
and support the troops.

293
00:11:51,699 --> 00:11:54,589
And this year,
DJ Khaled is hosting.

294
00:11:54,599 --> 00:11:56,229
He's got, like,
a gazillion hit songs,

295
00:11:56,239 --> 00:11:58,059
and he's super famous.

296
00:11:58,069 --> 00:12:00,359
I saw him on a tax commercial.

297
00:12:00,369 --> 00:12:02,599
What if I could get us
an invite?

298
00:12:02,609 --> 00:12:04,269
To sing?

299
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:06,669
No, to run military dark ops.

300
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:10,269
Yes, of course, to sing.

301
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:12,339
Is there a competition?

302
00:12:12,349 --> 00:12:13,539
There should always be
a competition.

303
00:12:13,549 --> 00:12:16,709
Oh, um...
well, well, no, but...

304
00:12:16,719 --> 00:12:18,819
let's sing together again.

305
00:12:18,829 --> 00:12:21,249
And... and maybe
I'll see my dad.

306
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:23,389
Or maybe I won't,
you know, because he has

307
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:25,159
something really important
to do.

308
00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:26,819
Or maybe I'll be
the most important thing

309
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:29,059
in his life this time.

310
00:12:29,069 --> 00:12:31,169
Maybe.

311
00:12:32,809 --> 00:12:35,199
- Who's with me?
- Me. Mm-hmm.

312
00:12:35,209 --> 00:12:38,829
Yeah. I suddenly have a lot
of free time, so hell yeah.

313
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:41,169
Well, I just got
kicked out of flight school

314
00:12:41,179 --> 00:12:42,839
for killing 300 fake people.

315
00:12:42,849 --> 00:12:45,779
- I hate fake people.
- I hate a fake bitch.

316
00:12:45,789 --> 00:12:48,649
Can you fly when
you're eight months pregnant?

317
00:12:48,659 --> 00:12:50,449
- What?
- No.

318
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:51,309
Um...

319
00:12:51,319 --> 00:12:53,319
- Look.
- Oh...

320
00:12:53,329 --> 00:12:55,079
That's...
that's eight months pregnant?

321
00:12:55,089 --> 00:12:56,589
You guys didn't notice?

322
00:12:56,599 --> 00:12:58,089
- Well, congratulations.
- Oh, my God.

323
00:12:58,099 --> 00:13:00,519
Ah!

324
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,589
- I mean, I'm so happy for you.
- Amazing! - Wow.

325
00:13:02,599 --> 00:13:04,229
Do you know who the father is?

326
00:13:04,239 --> 00:13:05,329
Eh.

327
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:06,599
- Oh. - Oh.
- Congratulations.

328
00:13:06,609 --> 00:13:08,529

329
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:11,169
Okay, well, Stacie's out.

330
00:13:11,179 --> 00:13:13,739
So I guess, Emily, you're in.

331
00:13:13,749 --> 00:13:15,869
- Oh, yeah. I'm in for sure.
- Yeah!

332
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:17,609
Yay.

333
00:13:17,619 --> 00:13:20,479

334
00:13:20,489 --> 00:13:21,839

Where'd you guys even come from?

347
00:13:57,789 --> 00:13:59,449
A little town called
Persistence, sweet cheeks.

348
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:00,649
That's right.
Here, here's the thing.

349
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:02,219
Look at this, ladies.

350
00:14:02,229 --> 00:14:03,519
All-access passes.

351
00:14:03,529 --> 00:14:05,749
We're tall enough
for all the rides.

352
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:08,589
You can run,
but you cannot hide.

353
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:10,389
This d'aca'mentary is happening!

354
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,729
We're gonna film
this whole thing.

355
00:14:11,739 --> 00:14:12,589
It's gonna be beautiful.

356
00:14:12,599 --> 00:14:13,889
We're making a beautiful
d'aca'mentary.

357
00:14:13,899 --> 00:14:15,259
In fact, we gotta set up.

358
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:16,329
Where are we gonna set up, John?

359
00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:17,329
I want to give you the...

00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:19,369

Welcome to Spain, Bellas.

366
00:14:35,689 --> 00:14:37,419
A few important things
to note before we begin.

367
00:14:37,429 --> 00:14:39,589
Grab your luggage.

368
00:14:39,599 --> 00:14:41,659
All right, thank you.

369
00:14:41,669 --> 00:14:43,799
You always want
to stay 25 feet...

370
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:50,829
...choke.

371
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:54,239
...very sharp. We do not
want you to impale yourself.

372
00:14:55,509 --> 00:14:57,769
I hope you all heard
each and every word,

373
00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:00,849
or else you might
very well end up dead.

374
00:15:03,289 --> 00:15:04,439
Ladies, I'm messing with you.

375
00:15:04,449 --> 00:15:06,679
On behalf of the Department
of Defense, we would like

376
00:15:06,689 --> 00:15:08,979
to welcome you to
Naval Air Station Rota, Spain.

377
00:15:08,989 --> 00:15:11,449
And a sincere thank-you
for coming out to entertain

378
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:12,689
our troops and their families.

379
00:15:12,699 --> 00:15:14,319
We're excited for this tour.

380
00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:15,919
My name's Chicago.
Over here to my left

381
00:15:15,929 --> 00:15:18,359
is Captain Bernie,
who we like to call Zeke.

382
00:15:18,369 --> 00:15:20,789
- Ladies.
- We're gonna be with you the whole tour

383
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:22,659
- as your escorts and security details.
- Question.

384
00:15:22,669 --> 00:15:24,709
Will we all be
showering together?

385
00:15:27,479 --> 00:15:30,739
Uh, first up is a sound check.

386
00:15:30,749 --> 00:15:33,909
We'll have you back
to the hotel by 1430.

387
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:35,469
Maybe hit the rain locker,

388
00:15:35,479 --> 00:15:38,339
back here for the big show
at 1700. Yeah.

389
00:15:38,349 --> 00:15:41,759
1700... is that,
like, later than the night?

390
00:15:42,829 --> 00:15:43,879
It's 5:00.

391
00:15:43,889 --> 00:15:45,419
Okay. Whatever.

392
00:15:45,429 --> 00:15:47,719
- Okay... Yep.
- Question, question.

393
00:15:47,729 --> 00:15:49,759
Um, so this is the first base.

394
00:15:49,769 --> 00:15:52,639
Will we be going to second base
with you guys?

395
00:15:54,439 --> 00:15:56,589
And then,
maybe a few days later,

396
00:15:56,599 --> 00:15:58,559
we'll go to third base?

397
00:15:58,569 --> 00:16:00,669
That's a "no" for me, so...

398
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:01,999
Wait, what's after
the third base?

399
00:16:02,009 --> 00:16:03,969
Why don't we get you
to your first venue?

400
00:16:03,979 --> 00:16:05,469
Come on.

401
00:16:05,479 --> 00:16:07,639
All right, well, we are

402
00:16:07,649 --> 00:16:08,869
really excited to have you here.

403
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:10,509
Right now we're in Hangar Three.

404
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:12,539
This is where we keep
all of our helicopters.

405
00:16:12,549 --> 00:16:14,409
Of course, now we've got
the big stage

406
00:16:14,419 --> 00:16:15,909
built up for the tour.

407
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:18,719
So, on the tour,
we've got three bands.

408
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:20,619
Over here, we got Saddle Up.

409
00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:23,389
This is Young Sparrow
and DJ Dragon Nutz.

410
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,519
And behind me is Evermoist.

411
00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:26,989
Oh!

412
00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:29,389
And check it out.
DJ Khaled just rolled in.

413
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:30,589
Let's set the stage, all right?

414
00:16:30,599 --> 00:16:31,659
- Let's get ready before the...
- So we should turn around

415
00:16:31,669 --> 00:16:33,629
- and shoot into it, I think.
- ...the Bellas out.

416
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:34,629
- Get the Bellas...
- Hey, guys.

417
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:35,799
Come say hey to the new group.

418
00:16:35,809 --> 00:16:37,399
- Yo. - Hi.
- Oh.

419
00:16:37,409 --> 00:16:39,839
Hello. We're the Bellas,

420
00:16:39,849 --> 00:16:42,869
formerly of Barden University
and currently of life.

421
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:44,779
- Ladies.
- Howdy.

422
00:16:44,789 --> 00:16:45,979
- Hey. - Hey.
- Ladies, I want

423
00:16:45,989 --> 00:16:47,379
to give you
a little forewarning.

424
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:48,849
My man's social anxiety,

425
00:16:48,859 --> 00:16:50,949
when he's not behind the
turntables, it's kind of crazy.

426
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,819
- So be easy, all right?

This is Serenity,
Veracity and Charity.

431
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:04,999
- Hi. - Hey.
- Hi.

432
00:17:05,009 --> 00:17:08,039
If I joined your group,
I could be Obesity.

433
00:17:09,009 --> 00:17:11,069
- Get it?
- Oh, if you're wondering,

434
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:13,039
- our presence here has nothing to do with...
- Nothing.

435
00:17:13,049 --> 00:17:15,369
...the nationally televised
"Salute to the Troops" special

436
00:17:15,379 --> 00:17:18,409
where DJ Khaled is going to
pick one group to open for him

437
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:19,579
at the end of this tour.

438
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:21,679
That was a lot of exposition.

439
00:17:21,689 --> 00:17:23,849
So there is a competition.

440
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:25,349
I knew it.

441
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,779
- And so there is.
- Idiots!

442
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:28,849
What, do you think we

443
00:17:28,859 --> 00:17:30,449
care about just watching
you guys?

444
00:17:30,459 --> 00:17:31,989
It's a competition! Hello!

445
00:17:31,999 --> 00:17:34,419
You guys just sing
other people's songs, right?

446
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:36,729
- Like a cover band.
- No, no, no, no.

447
00:17:36,739 --> 00:17:37,859
- No.
- Uh, no, no, no. Uh, well,

448
00:17:37,869 --> 00:17:40,929
actually, Emily writes
original songs for the Bellas.

449
00:17:40,939 --> 00:17:42,599
I mean, I don't really
do it anymore.

450
00:17:42,609 --> 00:17:44,099
- I kind of did that one, and then I...
- Hey.

451
00:17:44,109 --> 00:17:46,099
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
You with us or against us?

452
00:17:46,109 --> 00:17:48,599
And it was one of your dads
who gave you

453
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,139
the spot on the tour, right?

454
00:17:50,149 --> 00:17:52,139
- Oh, my God.
- Um...

455
00:17:52,149 --> 00:17:53,109
- Ooh...
- Guys, stop.

456
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:54,609
They just don't like
sharing the spotlight,

457
00:17:54,619 --> 00:17:55,679
so they're trying
to intimidate us.

458
00:17:55,689 --> 00:17:57,849
Let's just take the high road
and do what we do.

459
00:17:57,859 --> 00:17:59,119
You thinking what I'm thinking?

460
00:17:59,129 --> 00:17:59,749
What are you thinking?

461
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:00,749
A riff-off.

462
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:03,619
- That's not what I was thinking.
- A riff-off!

463
00:18:03,629 --> 00:18:05,959
Wait. Yes.
A riff-off! Yes!

464
00:18:05,969 --> 00:18:07,759
- What is a riff-off?
- Yeah.

465
00:18:07,769 --> 00:18:09,089
A riff-off is a little game

466
00:18:09,099 --> 00:18:11,629
that we like to play
to see who's better.

467
00:18:11,639 --> 00:18:13,599
- Mm-hmm.
- We start with a topic. Um...

468
00:18:13,609 --> 00:18:15,499
- Let's say "party songs."
- Ooh. - Nice.

469
00:18:15,509 --> 00:18:16,929
Yeah, and then we
lay down a beat.

470
00:18:16,939 --> 00:18:19,829
Oh, yeah, bring it, Bellas!

471
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:22,819

Yeah, so you guys saw
what we did there, right?

492
00:19:30,549 --> 00:19:32,609
- Yeah.
- So... it's singing.

493
00:19:32,619 --> 00:19:33,839
No, well...

494
00:19:33,849 --> 00:19:35,809
We just took the last word
of the old song

495
00:19:35,819 --> 00:19:37,009
and matched it
with the first word

496
00:19:37,019 --> 00:19:38,879
of the new song,
but you stay on tempo,

497
00:19:38,889 --> 00:19:40,579
stay on beat,
stay on pitch and, of course,

498
00:19:40,589 --> 00:19:42,619
- keep it in the relative key.
- That was great.

499
00:19:42,629 --> 00:19:44,149
- That was really well done.
- Yeah.

500
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:45,919

00:19:53,769 --> 00:19:54,759

00:23:50,999 --> 00:23:53,789
The Bellas are not as good
as the other bands.

600
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:56,159

So...

612
00:24:46,289 --> 00:24:48,209
Emily, is it true
what you said back there?

613
00:24:48,219 --> 00:24:50,119
Are you really
not writing anymore?

614
00:24:50,129 --> 00:24:52,119
Well, not...
I mean, not right now.

615
00:24:52,129 --> 00:24:53,819
Anyway, I've got 21 credits

616
00:24:53,829 --> 00:24:56,189
that I'm taking this semester.
The GRE is coming up.

617
00:24:56,199 --> 00:24:58,359
It's right around the corner.
Uh, and...

618
00:24:58,369 --> 00:25:00,389
I got a hamster now.

619
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:02,159
Aw. That's amazing.

620
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:04,559
Well, don't give up.
My dad always says,

621
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:06,029
"Age wrinkles the body,

622
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:08,569
but quitting
wrinkles the soul."

623
00:25:08,579 --> 00:25:10,149
Hmm.

624
00:25:11,449 --> 00:25:15,069
- Three...
- How about those Bulls?

625
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:17,439
Gotta love those Cubs.

626
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:21,379
And the deep dish pizza,
'cause it's so...

627
00:25:21,389 --> 00:25:22,929
deep.

628
00:25:23,459 --> 00:25:24,549
Chicago.

629
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:25,859
Right?

630
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:28,489
Yeah, I'm actually from Georgia.

631
00:25:28,499 --> 00:25:29,549
Oh.

632
00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:30,959
So, what's your story?

633
00:25:30,969 --> 00:25:32,089
Why are you here?

634
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:33,889
Oh, boy. Um...

635
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:35,959
Long story short,
I was in the NG,

636
00:25:35,969 --> 00:25:39,099
but my CO recommended me
for OCS after, uh, AIT.

637
00:25:39,109 --> 00:25:41,929
Then came OBC
and RTB where I, uh,

638
00:25:41,939 --> 00:25:43,899
was the, uh, DG of my class.

639
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:46,299
It's... I don't know.

640
00:25:46,309 --> 00:25:48,069
Sorry. Um...

641
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:49,839
I joined the National Guard.

642
00:25:49,849 --> 00:25:51,339
They helped put me
through college.

643
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:54,209
I spent about
a year stationed in Kabul.

644
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:57,309
Uh, actually overseeing
a canine unit over there.

645
00:25:57,319 --> 00:25:58,879
We trained German shepherds,

646
00:25:58,889 --> 00:26:00,589
we trained pit bulls...

647
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:02,449
Dogs.

648
00:26:02,459 --> 00:26:03,549
I love dogs.

649
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:05,259
I love animals, in general.

650
00:26:05,269 --> 00:26:07,859
- Animals are cute.
- You're cute. I mean, what?

651
00:26:07,869 --> 00:26:09,929
- What about you?
- Me? Me.

652
00:26:09,939 --> 00:26:11,099
Uh, shorter story...

653
00:26:11,109 --> 00:26:13,459
I was in a singing group
in college,

654
00:26:13,469 --> 00:26:18,199
and then now I am still
in that same singing group,

655
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:20,239
but not in college.

656
00:26:20,249 --> 00:26:21,499
- But you're committed.
- I am committed.

657
00:26:21,509 --> 00:26:22,969
- That's great.
- Yeah, I love commitment

658
00:26:22,979 --> 00:26:24,309
- and being committed.
- Yeah.

659
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:26,239
- Not to, like, an asylum. Whoa.
- Right.

660
00:26:26,249 --> 00:26:27,649
Or, like, a hospital, like,
it's... I'm not saying...

661
00:26:27,659 --> 00:26:29,379
- Yeah, no, I know.
- But, like... just, I like...

662
00:26:29,389 --> 00:26:31,379
I love love.
I love being committed to love.

663
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:34,219
Not to you, but to, like...
I love, um, like, oranges.

664
00:26:34,229 --> 00:26:35,449
- Oranges.
- I love...

665
00:26:35,459 --> 00:26:37,589
Hey. Uh, girls?

666
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:39,259
- Hmm?
- We have separate rooms. We don't have to

667
00:26:39,269 --> 00:26:40,389
sleep on top
of each other anymore.

668
00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:42,519
- What?
- Hey, that's great.

669
00:26:42,529 --> 00:26:44,089
Um, not sexually.

670
00:26:44,099 --> 00:26:45,569
There was that one time.

671
00:26:57,219 --> 00:26:59,279
Stop being so loud.

672
00:26:59,289 --> 00:27:01,079
- Yeah. No, yeah.
- Oh, that's what I want.

673
00:27:01,089 --> 00:27:02,309
Uh, no, that's the molasses one.

674
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:04,009
No, you're not gonna
like that one.

675
00:27:04,019 --> 00:27:05,279
- This one.
- I don't want molasses.

676
00:27:05,289 --> 00:27:07,219
Okay, you guys, so we've never

677
00:27:07,229 --> 00:27:09,179
competed against bands
that play actual instruments.

678
00:27:09,189 --> 00:27:10,319
What's the plan?

679
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:13,219
I really think we should just
stay true to ourselves,

680
00:27:13,229 --> 00:27:15,429
- and it will all figure itself out.
- Emily?

681
00:27:15,439 --> 00:27:18,029
- Mm-hmm.
- Please hear this in the best way possible.

682
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:19,689
You're a very stupid person.

683
00:27:19,699 --> 00:27:21,699
You know what?
Maybe it won't matter

684
00:27:21,709 --> 00:27:24,269
if we win or not, because
they will like us so much

685
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:26,229
that they will invite us
to keep touring with them.

686
00:27:26,239 --> 00:27:28,099
And it won't matter
if I get into vet school

687
00:27:28,109 --> 00:27:29,699
because we will be together
as a family,

688
00:27:29,709 --> 00:27:31,309
supporting each other.

689
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:33,149

what it's all about?

Yeah, except for all families
break apart,

692
00:27:36,689 --> 00:27:40,659
and the only person you can
ever truly rely on is yourself.

00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:45,189
All right, time to drop a smash.

You're English. Hi.

725
00:29:32,299 --> 00:29:34,689
That's right. I saw you do
the, uh, sound check,

726
00:29:34,699 --> 00:29:38,159
- um, thing that you guys...
- Yeah. The riff-off thing.

727
00:29:38,169 --> 00:29:39,399
- Riff-off.
- Yeah. I don't know why we

728
00:29:39,409 --> 00:29:40,629
keep challenging people
to those.

729
00:29:40,639 --> 00:29:42,169
We... we don't ever
actually win.

730
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:44,169
- Oh.
- Do you work for the USO?

731
00:29:44,179 --> 00:29:46,239
Uh, no, I-I work for DJ Khaled.

732
00:29:46,249 --> 00:29:47,769
Sorry. I'm-I'm Theo.

733
00:29:47,779 --> 00:29:48,569
- Hi. I'm Beca.
- Hi.

734
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:50,779
- Nice to meet you.
- How you doing?

735
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:51,579
Sorry, you are a...

736
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:53,209
- Oh, I'm a...
- Music executive?

737
00:29:53,219 --> 00:29:54,309
...music exec
at Khaled's label.

738
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:55,549
- Really?
- Yeah.

739
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:57,319
- What?
- No, I-I... I work

740
00:29:57,329 --> 00:29:58,719
with music executives,
and you...

741
00:29:58,729 --> 00:30:00,689
they... they don't look
like you.

742
00:30:00,699 --> 00:30:01,849
Oh.

743
00:30:01,859 --> 00:30:04,519
What... what do I look like?

744
00:30:04,529 --> 00:30:05,419
A turtle.

745
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:08,859
Well, that's in...
incredibly specific.

746
00:30:08,869 --> 00:30:10,799
But, like, you literally
look just like that.

747
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,229
No, no. It's accurate.

748
00:30:12,239 --> 00:30:13,469
You said you work
with music execs.

749
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:16,729
Oh. Yeah. Um, no, I'm a...

750
00:30:16,739 --> 00:30:18,269
I'm a music producer.

751
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:19,839
I'm sort of freelancing
right now.

752
00:30:19,849 --> 00:30:21,509
Oh, and I sing for fun.

753
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:24,109
I'm interested to see
the Bellas in action.

754
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:27,479
Yeah, maybe we'll even open
for DJ Khaled in the end.

755
00:30:27,489 --> 00:30:29,509
You don't think
you'll open for Khaled?

756
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:31,749
Uh, no, I-I...
I didn't say that.

757
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:34,219
Yeah, you did. You did.
You just said it before.

758
00:30:34,229 --> 00:30:35,489
You kind of implied it,
if anything.

759
00:30:35,499 --> 00:30:36,819
- Well, I just...
- I could just

760
00:30:36,829 --> 00:30:39,689
tell him that you sing
for fun, if you like.

761
00:30:39,699 --> 00:30:41,389
No, I-I was just trying to...
I-I'm-I'm...

Tough blow. What was that?

872
00:36:06,689 --> 00:36:08,439
That, my friend, was "Taps"

873
00:36:08,449 --> 00:36:09,749
from the back of the house.

874
00:36:09,759 --> 00:36:10,949
Salute, salute.
We have to salute.

875
00:36:10,959 --> 00:36:12,749
Stand at attention.
This is "Taps."

876
00:36:12,759 --> 00:36:14,819
It's to honor fallen soldiers,

877
00:36:14,829 --> 00:36:16,919
and tonight,
it's the fallen Bellas.

878
00:36:16,929 --> 00:36:19,819
Look at this. Those girls
don't even know what to do.

879
00:36:19,829 --> 00:36:21,559
They look like idiots.

880
00:36:21,569 --> 00:36:22,959
This is the best thing
for the movie.

881
00:36:22,969 --> 00:36:25,069
It couldn't be better.

882
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:29,699
Should we be considering
using instruments?

883
00:36:29,709 --> 00:36:31,229
Is that crazy?

884
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:33,069
Oh, that's so funny.

885
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:35,209
You know, I'm gonna pretend
that you didn't just say that

886
00:36:35,219 --> 00:36:36,309
so we can still be friends.

887
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:39,039
If we had drums,
then we wouldn't need Lilly,

888
00:36:39,049 --> 00:36:40,809
and if we had bass,
then we wouldn't need me.

889
00:36:40,819 --> 00:36:41,679
And we're still not clear

890
00:36:41,689 --> 00:36:43,249
why Jessica and Ashley
are even here.

891
00:36:43,259 --> 00:36:44,979
D-Did they just say our names?

892
00:36:44,989 --> 00:36:46,579
Don't be stupid.

893
00:36:46,589 --> 00:36:48,249
You know what? I have an idea.

894
00:36:48,259 --> 00:36:51,089
We just need to show DJ Khaled
that we are different

895
00:36:51,099 --> 00:36:54,259
and better than all
of those other bands, you know?

896
00:36:54,269 --> 00:36:55,659
I think we did great.

897
00:36:55,669 --> 00:36:57,929
I just think the horn
cut our vibe.

898
00:36:57,939 --> 00:37:00,059
True that.

899
00:37:00,069 --> 00:37:01,599
All right, ladies.
Pick up your tits.

900
00:37:01,609 --> 00:37:02,829
We're going out.

901
00:37:02,839 --> 00:37:03,999
What do you mean, "going out"?

902
00:37:04,009 --> 00:37:05,099
What do you mean,
what do I mean?

903
00:37:05,109 --> 00:37:07,739
- We just sucked balls in front of DJ Khaled.
- Hmm?

904
00:37:07,749 --> 00:37:10,069
- Listening.
- He's staying at that fancy

905
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,609
casino hotel
across the street, okay?

906
00:37:11,619 --> 00:37:13,139
I say we all get up,
we get dressed,

907
00:37:13,149 --> 00:37:16,209
we go over there, and we show
him that we are not a joke.

908
00:37:16,219 --> 00:37:20,009
Emily, I can't believe

909
00:37:20,019 --> 00:37:23,579
that a half-decent idea
came out of your dumb mouth.

910
00:37:23,589 --> 00:37:24,989
- Thank you.
- Okay?

911
00:37:24,999 --> 00:37:27,019
- So let's get tarted up and...
- Tatted up?

912
00:37:27,029 --> 00:37:29,989
- Tarted. Yeah, yeah, tarted up.
- It sounds like "tatted up."

913
00:37:29,999 --> 00:37:31,829
- She means "tatted."
- She's the caramel tart.

914
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:34,229
She's a chocolate tart.
You're the vanilla tart.

915
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:36,029
Thanks, babe.

916
00:37:36,039 --> 00:37:38,029
Mm...

917
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:40,899
- Oh, "tarted."
- Oh, "tarted." "Tarted."

918
00:37:40,909 --> 00:37:42,669
If it's easier,
we'll just say "slutty."

919
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:43,739
- Okay, let's get slutty.
- We'll dress slutty.

920
00:37:43,749 --> 00:37:44,769
- Let's get slutty.
- Okay, great.

921

Nothing.

Ain't that Mr. Eye Contact?

He knows Khaled, right?

959
00:39:19,969 --> 00:39:21,029

- Great idea.
- Patricia,

963
00:39:26,949 --> 00:39:28,739
you know how worried
I've been about you?

964
00:39:28,749 --> 00:39:29,879
You shouldn't have run away.

965
00:39:29,889 --> 00:39:31,409
You should've talked to me.

966
00:39:31,419 --> 00:39:35,979
About what, the C-4 explosives
I found in the cereal box?

967
00:39:35,989 --> 00:39:38,279
Or what about the time
you smuggled drugs

968
00:39:38,289 --> 00:39:40,219
in Sir Bounce-a-lot
and I had to see him

969
00:39:40,229 --> 00:39:44,289
get torn apart by custom agents
right in front of me?

970
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:47,289
Sweetheart,
it was my profession.

971
00:39:47,299 --> 00:39:49,159
What, being dodgy?

972
00:39:49,169 --> 00:39:51,199
Well, that's one word for it.

973
00:39:51,209 --> 00:39:54,429
I mean, yeah, I was a criminal,
but I'm different now.

974
00:39:54,439 --> 00:39:55,869
How'd you even find me?

975
00:39:55,879 --> 00:39:56,999
Well, what do you mean?

976
00:39:57,009 --> 00:39:58,299
I've been in hiding.

977
00:39:58,309 --> 00:39:59,839
Ah, my darling girl,

978
00:39:59,849 --> 00:40:01,769
I've known where
you've been for years.

979
00:40:01,779 --> 00:40:05,179
Uh, it's impossible for you
not to stand out in a crowd.

980
00:40:05,189 --> 00:40:06,939
Yeah, why do I have to be
so brilliant

981
00:40:06,949 --> 00:40:08,279
at every single thing I do?

982
00:40:08,289 --> 00:40:10,749
Here, look.
I've always kept this photo

983
00:40:10,759 --> 00:40:13,179
of you and me close to my heart.

984
00:40:13,189 --> 00:40:15,889
We used to play together.
We used to sing together.

985
00:40:15,899 --> 00:40:17,219
We used to be a team.

986
00:40:17,229 --> 00:40:19,289
- None of this is happening, okay?
- But-but...

987
00:40:19,299 --> 00:40:20,829
No "but, but, but." No!

988
00:40:20,839 --> 00:40:22,469
But... darling.

- I'm not falling for it.

00:41:53,289 --> 00:41:54,979
We're throwing a...
a little party for him,

1026
00:41:54,989 --> 00:41:56,349
if he decides to show.

1027
00:41:56,359 --> 00:41:57,949
You guys should hang out.
You want to hang out?

1028
00:41:57,959 --> 00:41:59,319
- Twist my arm. We'll do it.
- Yeah.

1029
00:41:59,329 --> 00:42:00,489
Well, let's go.
I'll give you a tour.

1030
00:42:00,499 --> 00:42:02,389
- Great. - Yeah.
- All right, come this way.

1031
00:42:02,399 --> 00:42:05,429
Uh, Khaled, right now he's, uh,
into this kind of feng shui,

1032
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,529
so he has a specific kind
of arrangement

1033
00:42:07,539 --> 00:42:09,499
to maximize his chi.

1034
00:42:09,509 --> 00:42:12,899
And, oh, Sunburst here
is Khaled's juiceologist.

1035
00:42:12,909 --> 00:42:15,069
Ah, Theo, pardon my zesting.

1036
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:16,239
Would you like a beet juice?

1037
00:42:16,249 --> 00:42:17,539
Your glands look frustrated.

1038
00:42:17,549 --> 00:42:18,909
In my country,

1039
00:42:18,919 --> 00:42:20,309
beet juice was reserved
for the king.

1040
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:22,489
DJ Khaled is the king
of the beats.

1041
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:27,319
You know, like the...
Beat King, 'cause he's the...

1042
00:42:27,329 --> 00:42:29,319
Oh, honey, that was...
we didn't like that at all.

1043
00:42:29,329 --> 00:42:30,449
It's awful. I know.

1044
00:42:30,459 --> 00:42:34,049
Um, can you explain this,
uh, terrifying situation?

1045
00:42:34,059 --> 00:42:36,189
- What? What, my... the face?
- Not your face.

1046
00:42:36,199 --> 00:42:38,389
- Um, the thing behind you.
- Oh, the apiary.

1047
00:42:38,399 --> 00:42:41,599
- Hmm.
- Oh, right, yeah, no, this is, uh, a portable beehive

1048
00:42:41,609 --> 00:42:44,329
that Sunburst uses
to harvest natural honey.

1049
00:42:44,339 --> 00:42:46,399
Doesn't seem like a disaster
waiting to happen.

1050
00:42:46,409 --> 00:42:47,299
Yes, it can be.

1051
00:42:47,309 --> 00:42:49,399
Oh, Beca,
I got to show you something.

1052
00:42:49,409 --> 00:42:50,569
You're gonna love this.

1053
00:42:50,579 --> 00:42:52,039
Sure.

1054
00:42:52,049 --> 00:42:53,339
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1055
00:42:53,349 --> 00:42:54,939
- Let's do it.
- I'll bring her right back.

1056
00:42:54,949 --> 00:42:55,939
Oh... yeah, just her.

1057
00:42:55,949 --> 00:42:57,279
Just borrow her for a second.

1058
00:42:57,289 --> 00:42:58,309
Whatever.

1059
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:01,079
Ooh. Is that an AKG C-24?

1060
00:43:01,089 --> 00:43:02,919
Yes, it certainly is.

1061
00:43:02,929 --> 00:43:04,219
Incredibly rare.

1062
00:43:04,229 --> 00:43:06,219
Madonna, Beyoncé, Joan Baez.

1063
00:43:06,229 --> 00:43:08,149
Oh, I'm happy for them.
That's nice.

1064
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:10,319
Yeah, the boss likes to be ready

1065
00:43:10,329 --> 00:43:12,289
for whenever inspiration
strikes him,

1066
00:43:12,299 --> 00:43:14,189
- so we have this setup here.
- Sure.

1067
00:43:14,199 --> 00:43:16,959
Yeah, must be good to be
really, really, really rich.

1068
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:19,169
Yeah.

1069
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:20,899
You want to give it a go?

1070
00:43:20,909 --> 00:43:22,069
- No.
- No?

1071
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:24,369
Couldn't possibly.

1072
00:43:24,379 --> 00:43:26,309
Ooh.

1073
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:27,539
We're coming to you live.

1074
00:43:27,549 --> 00:43:29,139
- Oh, that's nice.
- Oh, we should've recorded that.

1075
00:43:29,149 --> 00:43:30,339
Oh, she's a beaut.

1076
00:43:30,349 --> 00:43:32,109
- What's this?
- Oh, this is just...

1077
00:43:32,119 --> 00:43:34,109
Khaled has a...
a little loop going.

1078
00:43:34,119 --> 00:43:36,159

00:44:48,459 --> 00:44:50,119

I knew that song would get you.

1111
00:45:03,709 --> 00:45:05,079
- Whoo-hoo!
- Oh, yeah.

1112
00:45:06,409 --> 00:45:08,269
That's my girl.

1113
00:45:08,279 --> 00:45:10,139
I can't wait.

1114
00:45:10,149 --> 00:45:11,739
We'll travel the world
in my yacht,

1115
00:45:11,749 --> 00:45:15,379
stop at all your favorite
places... the Atlantic Ocean,

1116
00:45:15,389 --> 00:45:17,149
- the Pacific Ocean...
- That would be great!

1117
00:45:17,159 --> 00:45:19,549
But I'm in the middle
of a tour right now.

1118
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:21,579
But that's perfect.
I'll finally be able

1119
00:45:21,589 --> 00:45:23,549
to see one of your performances.

1120
00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:26,019
Dad, you've never come
to any of my performances.

1121
00:45:26,029 --> 00:45:29,359
Sweetheart, I've changed.

1122
00:45:29,369 --> 00:45:32,329
It's not the first time
I've heard that.

1123
00:45:32,339 --> 00:45:36,329
But you're still my little
Turnip Top, aren't you?

1124
00:45:36,339 --> 00:45:40,499
I promise I won't
screw it up this time.

1125
00:45:40,509 --> 00:45:42,769
General Posen and I
were wrapping up

1126
00:45:42,779 --> 00:45:44,539
a, uh, clandestine operation.

1127
00:45:44,549 --> 00:45:47,639
In fact, I've just come
from our classified briefing.

1128
00:45:47,649 --> 00:45:50,449
Oh, my God, so you were just
with Aubrey's dad?

1129
00:45:50,459 --> 00:45:52,249
He was so excited
to see your show.

1130
00:45:52,259 --> 00:45:55,199
It's just too bad
that he can't make it.

1131
00:45:56,159 --> 00:45:58,049
- Oh.
- Oh.

1132
00:45:58,059 --> 00:45:59,589
Oh, that's okay.

1133
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:01,519
- Yeah, it's-it's really okay.
- No, that's okay.

1134
00:46:01,529 --> 00:46:03,459
- It's totally fine. You know, he's a busy man.
- Uh-huh.

1135
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:05,459
- That's right.
- And my dad always said,

1136
00:46:05,469 --> 00:46:08,599
"Expect finite disappointment,
and remember,

1137
00:46:08,609 --> 00:46:10,399
there's always more
where that came from."

1138
00:46:10,409 --> 00:46:12,279
Oh, my God, Aubrey!

1139
00:46:24,189 --> 00:46:26,379
Someone open a window!

1140
00:46:26,389 --> 00:46:28,689
- What is wrong with this door?
- I don't know!

1141
00:46:30,689 --> 00:46:33,689
Stand down!

1142
00:46:33,699 --> 00:46:36,159

Checkmate.

1147
00:46:58,489 --> 00:46:59,549
Oh, hey.

1148
00:46:59,559 --> 00:47:02,189
Heard you all really, uh,
lit it up last night.

1149
00:47:03,329 --> 00:47:04,719
That's a great joke.

1150
00:47:04,729 --> 00:47:06,449
- It's really funny.
- Like a phoenix

1151
00:47:06,459 --> 00:47:10,159
rising from the ashes,
only a really sad version

1152
00:47:10,169 --> 00:47:12,329
where there's no phoenix
and just ash.

1153
00:47:30,789 --> 00:47:33,879
Sorry, I forgot where we were
in the conversation.

1154
00:47:33,889 --> 00:47:37,489
Next time, when you're trying
to impress DJ Khaled,

1155
00:47:37,499 --> 00:47:39,619
try to have some dignity.

1156
00:47:39,629 --> 00:47:43,619
Uh, we never do anything
with dignity, so...

1157
00:47:43,629 --> 00:47:45,239
Hey, where'd you go last night?

1158
00:47:46,169 --> 00:47:47,489
What, uh, you mean

1159
00:47:47,499 --> 00:47:49,499
when you were burning down
the hotel?

1160
00:47:49,509 --> 00:47:50,759
Dude, where were you?

1161
00:47:50,769 --> 00:47:53,729
Okay. I was with my father,
all right?

1162
00:47:53,739 --> 00:47:55,369
Wait, your dad?

1163
00:47:55,379 --> 00:47:57,169
He's been trying
to track me down for years,

1164
00:47:57,179 --> 00:47:58,369
and last night, he found me.

1165
00:47:58,379 --> 00:48:00,539
Why are you running from him?

1166
00:48:00,549 --> 00:48:02,479
I wish my dad
would pay attention to me.

1167
00:48:02,489 --> 00:48:05,609
Because my dad
wasn't a very nice man.

1168
00:48:05,619 --> 00:48:08,479
So, when I was 18,
I had to run away,

1169
00:48:08,489 --> 00:48:11,379
which was a real bitch
because of the chafing.

1170
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:14,389
And now he has found me,

1171
00:48:14,399 --> 00:48:17,519
and I don't know what to think.

1172
00:48:17,529 --> 00:48:21,329
I mean, I-I think that's
amazing, and so should you.

1173
00:48:21,339 --> 00:48:23,729
I mean, it-it's...
it's a crazy thing.

1174
00:48:23,739 --> 00:48:25,829
He's finally found you
after all these years?

1175
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:28,199
Now you can rekindle
the relationship,

1176
00:48:28,209 --> 00:48:29,939
and-and it could be
even stronger than it was.

1177
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:31,909
And maybe he was not
a very nice guy before,

1178
00:48:31,919 --> 00:48:33,809
but maybe he is now,
and maybe he's amazing

1179
00:48:33,819 --> 00:48:35,939
- and wonderful and he wants...
- Okay, Emily, you are so shrill

1180
00:48:35,949 --> 00:48:37,449
- and inarticulate!
- No, no!

1181
00:48:38,919 --> 00:48:40,509
Hello? Oh, it's Stacie.

1182
00:48:40,519 --> 00:48:42,749
Stacie! Stacie's calling me
on FaceTime.

1183
00:48:42,759 --> 00:48:44,479
- You guys! Stop. Get over here.
- What, Stacie?

1184
00:48:44,489 --> 00:48:46,179
- Oh, hello?
- Wait. Right over here.

1185
00:48:46,189 --> 00:48:47,489
- Oh, hi, hi, hi.
- You guys! - Guys!

1186
00:48:47,499 --> 00:48:49,589
- Oh! - Hi.
- Stace!

1187
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:51,719
- Where are you?
- Stacie, it's going terrible here.

1188
00:48:51,729 --> 00:48:53,429
Yeah, we getting our asses
handed to us.

1189
00:48:53,439 --> 00:48:56,699
Guys, I had the baby.

1190
00:48:57,969 --> 00:48:59,299
- What?
- Aw.

1191
00:48:59,309 --> 00:49:00,359
He's so cute.

1192
00:49:00,369 --> 00:49:02,269
She's a girl.

1193
00:49:02,279 --> 00:49:03,599
Oh, okay, then average.

1194
00:49:03,609 --> 00:49:04,699
What's her name?

1195
00:49:04,709 --> 00:49:06,469
Baby Fat Amy
or Baby Fat Patricia.

1196
00:49:06,479 --> 00:49:08,409
- You can choose.
- No, no, listen.

1197
00:49:08,419 --> 00:49:09,709
I know I've always been
your favorite.

1198
00:49:09,719 --> 00:49:11,719
Guys.

1199
00:49:12,889 --> 00:49:14,479
I named her Bella.

1200
00:49:14,489 --> 00:49:15,809
Aw.

1201
00:49:15,819 --> 00:49:17,449
- See? - That is adorable.
- Oh, that's perfect.

1202
00:49:17,459 --> 00:49:18,949
- That... Okay.
- I love you guys.

1203
00:49:18,959 --> 00:49:21,449
- We love you. We love you so much.
- We miss you.

1204
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:22,689
You guys.

1205
00:49:22,699 --> 00:49:25,289
She's so cute.

1206
00:49:25,299 --> 00:49:27,289
Guys, can we stop trying
to win this tour

1207
00:49:27,299 --> 00:49:28,729
and just sing together?

1208
00:49:28,739 --> 00:49:30,929
I mean, that's why
we're all here, right?

1209
00:49:30,939 --> 00:49:32,629
Yeah.

1210
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:34,869
But also, let's still try
and win this thing

1211
00:49:34,879 --> 00:49:37,729
because I don't know
how else to live.

1212
00:49:37,739 --> 00:49:40,239
Ciao, Bellas.

1213
00:49:40,249 --> 00:49:41,539
Who wants to go to Italy?

1214
00:49:41,549 --> 00:49:43,269
Four countries in four days.

1215
00:49:43,279 --> 00:49:45,009
- One, two...
- And then DJ Khaled will announce

1216
00:49:45,019 --> 00:49:47,749
the winner when we arrive
in France. Let's do this!

could be picked by DJ Khaled.

1275
00:52:13,099 --> 00:52:15,989
What a fitting swan song
for the Barden Bellas.

1276
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:17,889
Yes, and as these young women
approach 30

1277
00:52:17,899 --> 00:52:19,889
and cease to be of value
as human beings,

1278
00:52:19,899 --> 00:52:22,029
perhaps this
is the bittersweet memory

1279
00:52:22,039 --> 00:52:25,039
they will take
into the bar with them.

1280
00:52:38,849 --> 00:52:41,519
Okay,
welcome to the South of France.

1281
00:52:41,529 --> 00:52:43,919
We wanted to do something
kind of special for you guys.

1282
00:52:43,929 --> 00:52:45,649
Wow.

1283
00:52:45,659 --> 00:52:47,519
This feels like a group date
on The Bachelor.

1284
00:52:47,529 --> 00:52:49,519
Oh, it's just so beautiful.

1285
00:52:49,529 --> 00:52:51,589
Yeah, thank you.

1286
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:53,059
Not free.

1287
00:52:53,069 --> 00:52:54,559
Got it.

1288
00:52:54,569 --> 00:52:56,059
Hey.

1289
00:52:56,069 --> 00:53:01,069
Um, hey, I just wanted to say
thank you for... for this.

1290
00:53:01,079 --> 00:53:04,069
- Oh.
- And for looking out for us on this trip.

1291
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:08,439
And protecting
the United States... always.

1292
00:53:08,449 --> 00:53:10,079
It's my pleasure.

1293
00:53:10,089 --> 00:53:11,539
Must be kind of lonely,

1294
00:53:11,549 --> 00:53:13,039
always being away
from your family,

1295
00:53:13,049 --> 00:53:15,079
- being in a different place.
- Yeah.

1296
00:53:15,089 --> 00:53:17,019
But being in the Army
is kind of like

1297
00:53:17,029 --> 00:53:18,819
having a second family,
you know.

1298
00:53:18,829 --> 00:53:21,049
Well, yeah, of course you know.

1299
00:53:21,059 --> 00:53:23,689
I mean, you guys come together
for your tour,

1300
00:53:23,699 --> 00:53:25,219
and when it's over,
you go your separate ways.

1301
00:53:25,229 --> 00:53:28,959
But you're always gonna
be there for each other, right?

1302
00:53:28,969 --> 00:53:32,929
I mean, you're never
really alone.

1303
00:53:32,939 --> 00:53:35,969
Wow, that was really cheesy.

1304
00:53:35,979 --> 00:53:37,199
No.

1305
00:53:37,209 --> 00:53:38,679
I liked it.

1306
00:53:44,719 --> 00:53:45,849
You okay?

1307
00:53:45,859 --> 00:53:47,249
Oh, yeah.

1308
00:53:47,259 --> 00:53:49,929
Of course.

1309
00:53:50,929 --> 00:53:52,719
Don't hide your feelings
from me.

1310
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:54,789
We're like sisters, Aubrey.

1311
00:53:54,799 --> 00:53:57,859
It is "Aubrey," isn't it?

1312
00:53:57,869 --> 00:54:00,959
Mm-hmm.

1313
00:54:00,969 --> 00:54:03,729
Well, to be totally honest,
my dad was supposed to come

1314
00:54:03,739 --> 00:54:05,129
to see us perform tomorrow,

1315
00:54:05,139 --> 00:54:06,929
and I heard
that he can't make it.

1316
00:54:06,939 --> 00:54:09,599
And he's never actually
heard me sing with the Bellas,

1317
00:54:09,609 --> 00:54:11,969
and now maybe
he never will, so...

1318
00:54:11,979 --> 00:54:14,009
Dad? He's here!

1319
00:54:14,019 --> 00:54:15,509
What? Where?

1320
00:54:15,519 --> 00:54:18,979
That's my dad's yacht,
the Fat Dingo Bitch.

1321
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:20,979
That's what he always
used to call my mum.

1322
00:54:20,989 --> 00:54:23,009
- Oh.
- Obviously, he's come

1323
00:54:23,019 --> 00:54:25,749
to see me perform
in our last ever show!

1324
00:54:25,759 --> 00:54:27,219
My dad came!

1325
00:54:27,229 --> 00:54:29,129
Must feel aca-amazing.

1326
00:54:34,939 --> 00:54:36,959
They gotta be
close to making a decision.

1327
00:54:36,969 --> 00:54:39,029
They film the special
with DJ Khaled tomorrow.

1328
00:54:39,039 --> 00:54:41,029
And he needs an opening act.

1329
00:54:41,039 --> 00:54:43,869
Oh, look who it is.

1330
00:54:43,879 --> 00:54:47,039
Did you guys see the way
they got off stage yesterday?

1331
00:54:47,049 --> 00:54:48,669
They literally went out
of their way

1332
00:54:48,679 --> 00:54:50,039
not to congratulate us.

1333
00:54:50,049 --> 00:54:52,689
They clearly just see us
as a threat.

1334
00:54:54,649 --> 00:54:56,609
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, my God.

1335
00:54:56,619 --> 00:54:57,849
- You are so weird.
- Wow. Sometimes.

1336
00:54:57,859 --> 00:54:59,949
That's not fair.
You seem very nice.

1337
00:54:59,959 --> 00:55:01,619
Can I borrow you for a second?

1338
00:55:01,629 --> 00:55:02,889
- Yeah, great.
- Yeah? Come on.

1339
00:55:02,899 --> 00:55:03,889
- Great.
- You want to hold hands?

1340
00:55:03,899 --> 00:55:04,889
- Nope.
- Cool.

1341
00:55:04,899 --> 00:55:05,989
Where are we going?

1342
00:55:05,999 --> 00:55:08,289
You remember when you
burnt down DJ Khaled's room?

1343
00:55:08,299 --> 00:55:09,689
- No, that was not...
- No?

1344
00:55:09,699 --> 00:55:10,859
- I don't remember that.
- Back in Spain?

1345
00:55:10,869 --> 00:55:12,189
- No.
- You were looking for Lenny,

1346
00:55:12,199 --> 00:55:13,799
hiding behind the bushes,
released the bees.

1347
00:55:13,809 --> 00:55:15,199
No, I think that...
that was my sister.

1348
00:55:15,209 --> 00:55:16,259
I hate her. What?

1349
00:55:16,269 --> 00:55:17,869
DJ Khaled wants to meet you.

1350
00:55:17,879 --> 00:55:20,809
- Why?
- Hey, boss.

1351
00:55:21,809 --> 00:55:23,809
Theo, my guy.

1352
00:55:23,819 --> 00:55:25,809
Magical ears.

1353
00:55:25,819 --> 00:55:27,689
- Beca.
- H-Hello.

1354
00:55:28,889 --> 00:55:30,809
- How beautiful.
- Oh, thank you.

1355
00:55:30,819 --> 00:55:32,609
- So nice to meet you.
- ASAP!

1356
00:55:32,619 --> 00:55:33,849
Need a drink for Beca, ASAP!

1357
00:55:33,859 --> 00:55:34,849
Have a seat.

1358
00:55:34,859 --> 00:55:36,049
Make yourself at home.

1359
00:55:36,059 --> 00:55:37,349
Oh, my God.

1360
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:38,849
- Thank you.
- Just...

1361
00:55:38,859 --> 00:55:40,759
- Yeah.
- Here you go, mademoiselle.

1362
00:55:40,769 --> 00:55:42,019
Thank you.

1363
00:55:42,029 --> 00:55:43,829
I hope you like cherries.

1364
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:45,959
Beca, have you been talking
to my guy, Theo?

1365
00:55:45,969 --> 00:55:47,159
Yeah, he talks a lot.

1366
00:55:47,169 --> 00:55:49,099
But I have no idea
what's going on.

1367
00:55:49,109 --> 00:55:50,969
He doesn't actually give me
that much information.

1368
00:55:50,979 --> 00:55:52,799
I thought maybe
you could break the news.

1369
00:55:52,809 --> 00:55:54,369
Congratulations.

1370
00:55:54,379 --> 00:55:55,799
On what?

1371
00:55:55,809 --> 00:55:58,169
I want you to open up for me.

1372
00:55:58,179 --> 00:55:59,609
Tomorrow night.

1373
00:55:59,619 --> 00:56:01,309
Beca.

1374
00:56:01,319 --> 00:56:03,379
DJ Khaled.

1375
00:56:03,389 --> 00:56:05,089
Are you ready?

1376
00:56:07,859 --> 00:56:09,729
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

1377
00:56:10,759 --> 00:56:12,089
That is great.

1378
00:56:12,099 --> 00:56:14,659
You are not gonna
regret this. I...

1379
00:56:14,669 --> 00:56:17,729
The Bellas are gonna die.
Can I go tell them?

1380
00:56:17,739 --> 00:56:19,089
I-I think you misunderstood.

1381
00:56:19,099 --> 00:56:20,859
Uh, what DJ Khaled's
trying to say here

1382
00:56:20,869 --> 00:56:23,669
is that he doesn't want
the Bellas.

1383
00:56:23,679 --> 00:56:25,969
We want you.

1384
00:56:25,979 --> 00:56:27,299
- What?
- The other day,

1385
00:56:27,309 --> 00:56:29,969
when you was just
playing around with the loop

1386
00:56:29,979 --> 00:56:31,709
and you was singing
and you was just...

1387
00:56:31,719 --> 00:56:35,109
I could tell that you was
just playing around, but...

1388
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:38,979
I seen something,
I heard something,

1389
00:56:38,989 --> 00:56:41,779
then I felt something.

1390
00:56:41,789 --> 00:56:43,419
Amidst the chaos,
I went back in the room,

1391
00:56:43,429 --> 00:56:44,819
and I pulled your recording.

1392
00:56:44,829 --> 00:56:47,989
Why did you do that?

1393
00:56:47,999 --> 00:56:50,089
Because I wanted to know
what you could do on your own.

1394
00:56:50,099 --> 00:56:53,129
Beca, it's time to go
to the next level.

1395
00:56:53,139 --> 00:56:54,799
I see it.

1396
00:56:54,809 --> 00:56:57,129
I'm DJ Khaled, aka Billy.

1397
00:56:57,139 --> 00:56:59,929
- Who?
- I know these things.

1398
00:56:59,939 --> 00:57:03,269
That is so amazing.

1399
00:57:03,279 --> 00:57:04,969
That means the world to me,
honestly.

1400
00:57:04,979 --> 00:57:06,839
But I'm part of a group,

1401
00:57:06,849 --> 00:57:08,309
and we all have
something special.

1402
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:10,909
I respect
that you love your group,

1403
00:57:10,919 --> 00:57:12,449
but it's time for you
to move on.

1404
00:57:12,459 --> 00:57:14,179
It's time for you to grow.

1405
00:57:14,189 --> 00:57:17,319
It's time for you to climb that
mountaintop and reach the top.

1406
00:57:17,329 --> 00:57:19,219
And the group
will be happy for you.

1407
00:57:19,229 --> 00:57:21,359
What Khaled is trying
to say here is that

1408
00:57:21,369 --> 00:57:24,019
you've really gone as far
as you can with the girls.

1409
00:57:24,029 --> 00:57:26,329
It's time for you
to now flourish on your own.

1410
00:57:26,339 --> 00:57:29,189
Independent... ly.

1411
00:57:29,199 --> 00:57:30,859
These ain't opinions.

1412
00:57:30,869 --> 00:57:32,169
These are facts.

1413
00:57:32,179 --> 00:57:33,699
Yes.

1414
00:57:33,709 --> 00:57:35,229
Come with me a second.

1415
00:57:35,239 --> 00:57:36,469
Bless up.

1416
00:57:36,479 --> 00:57:38,839
Listen, I... I know it's a lot

1417
00:57:38,849 --> 00:57:40,169
- to take in, okay?
- Uh, yeah.

1418
00:57:40,179 --> 00:57:41,809
The label is gonna
sign you, Beca.

1419
00:57:41,819 --> 00:57:44,079
The label's gonna sign you.
They're gonna help you

1420
00:57:44,089 --> 00:57:46,479
- develop your own material as a solo act.
- Uh, yeah...

1421
00:57:46,489 --> 00:57:48,279
Th-This is very generous,

1422
00:57:48,289 --> 00:57:50,149
but we're talking
about my family.

1423
00:57:50,159 --> 00:57:51,949
- I'm-I'm... I'm not interested.
- It's...

1424
00:57:51,959 --> 00:57:53,989
- It's a tough decision. I get that.
- No, it's not.

1425
00:57:53,999 --> 00:57:56,359
It is. It is.

1426
00:57:56,369 --> 00:57:59,359
It's a big opportunity for you.
All right?

1427
00:57:59,369 --> 00:58:01,089
Look at me. Stop.

1428
00:58:01,099 --> 00:58:03,109
What are you doing?

1429
00:58:04,969 --> 00:58:06,799
Go home. Sleep on it.

1430
00:58:06,809 --> 00:58:08,169
You come back, and you tell me

1431
00:58:08,179 --> 00:58:11,269
what you want to do
in the morning, okay?

1432
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:13,239
All right?

1433
00:58:13,249 --> 00:58:15,949
I'm... I really am sorry. I...

1434
00:58:40,879 --> 00:58:42,469
Whoo!

1435
00:58:42,479 --> 00:58:45,499
Your performance
was incredible, Patricia.

1436
00:58:45,509 --> 00:58:47,339
So proud of you.

1437
00:58:47,349 --> 00:58:48,969
Thanks, Dad.
How did you see it?

1438
00:58:48,979 --> 00:58:50,039
Were you on the base?

1439
00:58:50,049 --> 00:58:51,979
Oh, you know me.
I've got my ways.

1440
00:58:51,989 --> 00:58:54,409
What a note to go out on, eh?

1441
00:58:54,419 --> 00:58:57,079
What do you say
we leave tonight?

1442
00:58:57,089 --> 00:59:00,149
I would, but tomorrow's, like,

1443
00:59:00,159 --> 00:59:02,419
the big televised event
with DJ Khaled,

1444
00:59:02,429 --> 00:59:04,889
and they're definitely gonna
pick the Bellas to perform.

1445
00:59:04,899 --> 00:59:07,319
So I need to be there
'cause my talent compensates

1446
00:59:07,329 --> 00:59:10,029
for the weaker members
of the group, like Beca.

1447
00:59:10,039 --> 00:59:11,329
Tomorrow it is.

1448
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:14,059
And you can go
wherever you want to go.

1449
00:59:14,069 --> 00:59:15,809
Urban Outfitters?

1450
00:59:17,079 --> 00:59:19,439
You gotta think bigger,
Sunshine.

1451
00:59:19,449 --> 00:59:21,169
A Caribbean tour.

1452
00:59:21,179 --> 00:59:23,009
Have you ever been
to Martinique?

1453
00:59:23,019 --> 00:59:26,439
Or the, uh...
the Cayman Islands?

1454
00:59:26,449 --> 00:59:29,009
- The Cayman Islands?
- Oh, they're beautiful,

1455
00:59:29,019 --> 00:59:31,579
just like my little girl.

1456
00:59:31,589 --> 00:59:33,579
Uh-huh. Right.

1457
00:59:33,589 --> 00:59:35,049
Dad, let me ask you...

1458
00:59:35,059 --> 00:59:36,549
what was your favorite moment
of the show?

1459
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:39,189
Well, there were too many
moments of greatness

1460
00:59:39,199 --> 00:59:40,989
from which to choose.

1461
00:59:40,999 --> 00:59:43,029
'Cause my favorite part
was the bit

1462
00:59:43,039 --> 00:59:44,329
where I sang that duet
with Beca,

1463
00:59:44,339 --> 00:59:46,229
and then was on the top
of the pyramid.

1464
00:59:46,239 --> 00:59:48,159
Oh, yeah.

1465
00:59:48,169 --> 00:59:50,129
Yeah, you were wonderful
in that part.

1466
00:59:50,139 --> 00:59:52,199
God! There was no pyramid!

1467
00:59:52,209 --> 00:59:54,269
And as if I'd be the top.

1468
00:59:54,279 --> 00:59:57,269
And I know exactly
what's in the Cayman Islands.

1469
00:59:57,279 --> 00:59:59,509
Yeah, I do.
That bank account

1470
00:59:59,519 --> 01:00:01,609
that Mum set up for me
on my 13th birthday.

1471
01:00:01,619 --> 01:00:04,509
She said it was just a bit
of an allowance, but...

1472
01:00:04,519 --> 01:00:08,219
I know she didn't want me
to ever need your dirty money.

1473
01:00:08,229 --> 01:00:11,149
How much is even in it anyway?

1474
01:00:11,159 --> 01:00:14,329
$180 million, give or take.

1475
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:19,489
When am I gonna learn...

1476
01:00:19,499 --> 01:00:21,439
to open my mail?!

1477
01:00:23,639 --> 01:00:25,629
I'm done with you, Dad.

1478
01:00:25,639 --> 01:00:27,599
Forever.

1479
01:00:27,609 --> 01:00:30,299
No, no, you're not.

1480
01:00:30,309 --> 01:00:33,109
We are done
when I get the money.

1481
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:35,209
Amy?

1482
01:00:35,219 --> 01:00:37,149
Is this man bothering you?

1483
01:00:37,159 --> 01:00:39,149
- Yes, he is. Yeah.
- Yeah.

1484
01:00:39,159 --> 01:00:41,549
Sir, step away from the Bella.

1485
01:00:41,559 --> 01:00:45,519
Patricia, all my accounts
are frozen.

1486
01:00:45,529 --> 01:00:48,389
Good-bye, Fergus.

1487
01:00:48,399 --> 01:00:52,159
I tried to do this
the nice way, Patricia.

1488
01:00:52,169 --> 01:00:54,609
You remember that!

1489
01:00:56,369 --> 01:00:59,399
So, do you know how to do this?
How do you do this?

1490
01:00:59,409 --> 01:01:01,339
- Pour the water over the sugar, and smash...
- Like this?

1491
01:01:01,349 --> 01:01:02,539
Do you guys know where Beca is?

1492
01:01:02,549 --> 01:01:05,139
Theo must have said
something to her by now.

1493
01:01:05,149 --> 01:01:06,609
The show's literally tomorrow.

1494
01:01:06,619 --> 01:01:09,179
- I know.
- Guys, if Khaled picks us,

1495
01:01:09,189 --> 01:01:11,259
it'll be our last show together.

1496
01:01:12,419 --> 01:01:14,579
Bellas, a toast.

1497
01:01:14,589 --> 01:01:17,019
- Ah, a Chloe toast.
- They say that...

1498
01:01:17,029 --> 01:01:19,219
home is where the heart is.

1499
01:01:19,229 --> 01:01:24,559
But you guys are the homes
that my heart lives in.

1500
01:01:24,569 --> 01:01:27,299
I am inside of all of you.

1501
01:01:29,109 --> 01:01:30,539
It feels so good.

1502
01:01:31,569 --> 01:01:34,039
- Cheers. - Cheers.
- Salud. - Cheers!

1503
01:01:34,049 --> 01:01:36,239
- Cheers!
- Guys, I love you so much.

1504
01:01:36,249 --> 01:01:38,239
- I feel like...
- Are you hallucinating?

1505
01:01:38,249 --> 01:01:41,139
Excuse me.
Uh, are you the Bellas?

1506
01:01:41,149 --> 01:01:43,039
- Yes.
- Oui, monsieur.

1507
01:01:43,049 --> 01:01:44,479
- Sí.
- My name is Henri.

1508
01:01:44,489 --> 01:01:47,279
Chicago sent me to take you
to the USO reception.

1509
01:01:47,289 --> 01:01:49,019
- Uh...
- Reception? - Huh?

1510
01:01:49,029 --> 01:01:51,289
Chicago never mentioned
any reception.

1511
01:01:51,299 --> 01:01:53,989
Something about an announcement?

1512
01:01:53,999 --> 01:01:56,489
- Oh. We won. - What?
- Did we win?

1513
01:01:56,499 --> 01:01:58,289
Um, we need to find our friends,

1514
01:01:58,299 --> 01:02:00,159
- Beca and Fat Amy.
- Great.

1515
01:02:00,169 --> 01:02:03,199
Oh, they are already there
with Chicago.

1516
01:02:03,209 --> 01:02:05,229
- Oh.
- Perfect.

1517
01:02:05,239 --> 01:02:08,099
Let's not keep this
handsome Frenchman waiting.

1518
01:02:08,109 --> 01:02:09,339
- Let's go. Shotgun!
- Ready?

1519
01:02:09,349 --> 01:02:10,539
I guess we should go.
Let's go.

1520
01:02:10,549 --> 01:02:13,109
- Yeah. - Come on.
- Hey, let's go. - Henri?

1521
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:15,409
- Oh, yeah. Whoo!
- Sounds like music.

1522
01:02:15,419 --> 01:02:18,579

The singing sounded very good.

1537

- Oh, merci beaucoup, Henri.
- Um, are we almost there?

1538
01:03:00,359 --> 01:03:02,519
Uh, yes. In fact...

1539
01:03:02,529 --> 01:03:04,619
'Cause it feels like
we've been driving forever.

1540
01:03:04,629 --> 01:03:06,229
...we are right here.

1541
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:08,029
Yay! Oh, great!

1542
01:03:08,039 --> 01:03:09,529
I don't know.
I can't lift it.

1543
01:03:09,539 --> 01:03:11,329
I can't see.
I can't see anything.

1544
01:03:11,339 --> 01:03:12,769
Why won't the shade go up?
It's, like, stuck.

1545
01:03:12,779 --> 01:03:14,729
- It's so dark out there.
- Can you guys see out yours?

1546
01:03:14,739 --> 01:03:18,399
- No. - No, I can't see.
- Well, this don't seem right.

1547
01:03:18,409 --> 01:03:20,039
Maybe we...

1548
01:03:20,049 --> 01:03:21,169
- Whoa!
- Oh!

1549
01:03:21,179 --> 01:03:23,109
What was that?

1550
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:25,619
I don't know. What was that?

1551
01:03:27,419 --> 01:03:29,049
What?

1552
01:03:29,059 --> 01:03:32,319
- What happened?
- Huh?

1553
01:03:32,329 --> 01:03:34,119
I don't know.

1554
01:03:34,129 --> 01:03:36,319
Hang on.
You guys, are we...

1555
01:03:36,329 --> 01:03:39,089
Are we floating?

1556
01:03:39,099 --> 01:03:40,829
- Why would we be floating?
- What?

1557
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:46,299
Guys?

1558
01:03:46,309 --> 01:03:47,599
You guys, I can't open the door.

1559
01:03:47,609 --> 01:03:49,329
What? The door's not opening?

1560
01:03:49,339 --> 01:03:51,769
It's the old van-ferry
death-trap maneuver.

1561
01:03:51,779 --> 01:03:54,109
I should've seen it coming.

1562
01:03:54,119 --> 01:03:55,339
- Oh, God.
- What?

1563
01:03:55,349 --> 01:03:57,709
- Open it. Open the door.
- Help!

1564
01:03:57,719 --> 01:03:58,839
Does... does anybody's
cell phone work?

1565
01:03:58,849 --> 01:03:59,839
Where's my cell phone?

1566
01:03:59,849 --> 01:04:01,139
No service.

1567
01:04:01,149 --> 01:04:02,579
No service. There's nothing.

1568
01:04:02,589 --> 01:04:05,279
- That's so inconvenient.
- Hell's bells!

1569
01:04:05,289 --> 01:04:06,619
We could scream
on the count of three.

1570
01:04:06,629 --> 01:04:08,649
- Okay. One, two, three.
- One, two, three!

1571
01:04:08,659 --> 01:04:10,199
Help!

1572
01:04:18,299 --> 01:04:20,669
Sir Bounce-a-lot.

1573
01:04:38,459 --> 01:04:41,219
- I told you we're through!
- I know.

1574
01:04:41,229 --> 01:04:43,549
But there are some people here

1575
01:04:43,559 --> 01:04:46,389
who think you should reconsider.

1576
01:04:46,399 --> 01:04:49,799
Amy!

1577
01:04:52,439 --> 01:04:53,729
How could you?

1578
01:04:53,739 --> 01:04:56,629
I swear to God,
if you hurt any one of them,

1579
01:04:56,639 --> 01:04:59,739
except for Jessica and Ashley,
I will kill you!

1580
01:04:59,749 --> 01:05:01,699
I don't want to hurt anyone,
Patricia.

1581
01:05:01,709 --> 01:05:04,669
The only one I wanted was you,
but you weren't with them,

1582
01:05:04,679 --> 01:05:06,239
were you?

1583
01:05:06,249 --> 01:05:07,909
Oh, well.

1584
01:05:07,919 --> 01:05:09,879
Plan B.

1585
01:05:09,889 --> 01:05:12,149
You have 30 minutes.

1586
01:05:12,159 --> 01:05:13,619
Come to the boat,

1587
01:05:13,629 --> 01:05:16,319
or your friends
swim with the fishies.

1588
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:18,789
And I think you know I mean it.

1589
01:05:18,799 --> 01:05:20,619
Oh, I know you mean it.

1590
01:05:20,629 --> 01:05:22,489
Because you're a terrible person

1591
01:05:22,499 --> 01:05:24,759
that does terrible things.

1592
01:05:24,769 --> 01:05:27,359
But there's one thing
you're forgetting, Dad.

1593
01:05:27,369 --> 01:05:28,729
I'm your daughter.

1594
01:05:28,739 --> 01:05:32,229
Your nightmare blood,
it runs through my veins!

1595
01:05:32,239 --> 01:05:33,939
Hey, Amy, um, I need to talk
to you about something.

1596
01:05:33,949 --> 01:05:36,539
- It's kind of important.
- Oh, yeah, just a sec.

1597
01:05:36,549 --> 01:05:38,169
- I'm on a call.
- Okay.

1598
01:05:38,179 --> 01:05:39,409
You think you're bad?

1599
01:05:39,419 --> 01:05:42,739
You have no idea
what I'm capable of.

1600
01:05:42,749 --> 01:05:44,809
I've graduated college.

1601
01:05:44,819 --> 01:05:46,509
I could do anything.

1602
01:05:46,519 --> 01:05:48,849
So say your prayers,

1603
01:05:48,859 --> 01:05:51,849
'cause Fat Amy is coming...

1604
01:05:51,859 --> 01:05:54,719
for you.

1605
01:05:54,729 --> 01:05:56,469
Now!

1606
01:05:59,439 --> 01:06:01,859
So...

1607
01:06:01,869 --> 01:06:04,399
which two of you

1608
01:06:04,409 --> 01:06:06,639
are Ashley and Jessica?

1609
01:06:08,249 --> 01:06:10,569
- Ah, shit.
- Okay, so...

1610
01:06:10,579 --> 01:06:11,639
I have kind of bad news.

1611
01:06:11,649 --> 01:06:13,909
Uh, and I know you're
gonna be fine. Uh, I know

1612
01:06:13,919 --> 01:06:15,789
- every-everybody's gonna be fine, but, like...
- Uh-huh.

1613
01:06:17,659 --> 01:06:18,979
Oh.

1614
01:06:18,989 --> 01:06:21,849
- Um, w-well...
- Yep.

1615
01:06:21,859 --> 01:06:23,849
We didn't get picked, man.
And you know what?

1616
01:06:23,859 --> 01:06:26,589
Like, screw them. It's not,
like, the whole story.

1617
01:06:26,599 --> 01:06:29,589
There's... uh, uh, uh...

1618
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:31,589
I don't know, I still feel
like I want to tell you

1619
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:32,459
'cause I think that, like,

1620
01:06:32,469 --> 01:06:34,429
secrets are, like,
the worst, right?

1621
01:06:34,439 --> 01:06:35,599
So...

1622
01:06:35,609 --> 01:06:37,459
Yeah, it's the worst.

1623
01:06:37,469 --> 01:06:38,869
Let's go.

1624
01:06:38,879 --> 01:06:40,329
Go where?

1625
01:06:40,339 --> 01:06:42,749
Don't worry.
We'll change in the cab.

1626
01:06:48,019 --> 01:06:49,539
Amy, what are we doing?

1627
01:06:49,549 --> 01:06:51,879
Why are we not calling
the police or Chicago?

1628
01:06:51,889 --> 01:06:53,849
No cops. There's no time.

1629
01:06:53,859 --> 01:06:56,379
And if my dad sees 'em,
he'll take off.

1630
01:06:56,389 --> 01:06:57,579
This is serious.

1631
01:06:57,589 --> 01:06:59,349
The Bellas
could really get hurt.

1632
01:06:59,359 --> 01:07:01,319
- Not on my watch.
- Amy, come on.

1633
01:07:01,329 --> 01:07:02,889
Look, I know my father.

1634
01:07:02,899 --> 01:07:04,489
I know his guys.

1635
01:07:04,499 --> 01:07:06,629
Some of them I know,
like, really well.

1636
01:07:06,639 --> 01:07:08,999
And I know that boat.

1637
01:07:09,009 --> 01:07:10,899
We can do this.

1638
01:07:10,909 --> 01:07:12,859
Okay. What's the plan?

1639
01:07:12,869 --> 01:07:15,729
First up, I need you
to pick up the pace.

1640
01:07:15,739 --> 01:07:17,649
This boat's not gonna
row itself.

1641
01:07:22,789 --> 01:07:24,779
Okay. That's the ladder
that'll take you

1642
01:07:24,789 --> 01:07:26,609
up to the main deck
where the Bellas are.

1643
01:07:26,619 --> 01:07:28,549
Do not let Fergus
hear what I'm doing below.

1644
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:30,549
Okay, giant distraction
coming up.

1645
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:32,979
- You sure about this?
- Have I ever let you down?

1646
01:07:32,989 --> 01:07:35,849
Dozens of examples
spring to mind, if I'm honest.

1647
01:07:35,859 --> 01:07:37,889
- What?
- Yeah, you're very unreliable.

1648
01:07:37,899 --> 01:07:39,889
It's, like, one of the
hallmarks of your personality.

1649
01:07:39,899 --> 01:07:42,499
I don't think we have time
to unpack that right now.

1650
01:07:42,509 --> 01:07:44,799
Shh. I'll just see you up top.

1651
01:07:44,809 --> 01:07:46,429
Nobody's gonna die tonight,
right?

1652
01:07:46,439 --> 01:07:47,729
- Yeah.
- Right?

1653
01:07:47,739 --> 01:07:49,669
- Yeah.
- Well, that doesn't help.

1654
01:07:49,679 --> 01:07:51,299
- Okay.
- Okay, ready?

1655
01:07:51,309 --> 01:07:52,739
I've got my serious face on now.

1656
01:07:52,749 --> 01:07:54,539
- Okay.
- It's time.

1657
01:07:54,549 --> 01:07:56,669
Let's do it.

1658
01:07:56,679 --> 01:08:00,309
Once we get the money,
we sail directly to Sydney.

1659
01:08:00,319 --> 01:08:02,549
Unless she doesn't show.

1660
01:08:02,559 --> 01:08:05,349
Then things get ugly.

1661
01:08:05,359 --> 01:08:06,949
Ten minutes, ladies.

1662
01:08:06,959 --> 01:08:09,429
Guys, you know
what we should do?

1663
01:08:10,629 --> 01:08:11,959
Where did you come from?

1664
01:08:11,969 --> 01:08:13,089
What?

1665
01:08:13,099 --> 01:08:14,429
You weren't here before.

1666
01:08:14,439 --> 01:08:16,429
I've been here the whole time.

1667
01:08:16,439 --> 01:08:18,869
I'm just small.

1668
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:28,539
Just... if we only have
ten minutes left,

1669
01:08:28,549 --> 01:08:31,709
I say we spend it
doing something we love.

1670
01:08:31,719 --> 01:08:35,989
Let's go out like Bellas and...
and sing one more song.

1671
01:08:37,989 --> 01:08:40,779
You want to sing right now?

1672
01:08:40,789 --> 01:08:42,989
I think we should sing
one more song, though.

1673
01:08:42,999 --> 01:08:44,989
I don't know if I feel like singing.

1674
01:08:44,999 --> 01:08:48,699
Oh, my God. Guys, I just want
to sing so bad.

1675
01:08:50,439 --> 01:08:51,829
We really think you'll like it.

1676
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:53,799
You want to entertain me?

1677
01:08:53,809 --> 01:08:55,869
Knock yourselves out.

1678
01:08:55,879 --> 01:08:57,599
Nine minutes.

1679
01:08:57,609 --> 01:08:59,599
Let's make it a loud one, guys.

1680
01:08:59,609 --> 01:09:01,499
You are terrible
at reading signals.

1681
01:09:01,509 --> 01:09:03,649

How could I forget the girl
who gave me this?

1709
01:11:21,849 --> 01:11:24,219
You really shouldn't
have put me in a time-out.

1710
01:11:26,019 --> 01:11:28,089
Let's dance.

1711

1712
01:11:42,909 --> 01:11:45,129

Come on. Yeah?

1715
01:11:52,309 --> 01:11:54,119
What?

1716
01:12:21,039 --> 01:12:23,799
Nipple cripple!

Nipple cripple!

1718
01:12:25,849 --> 01:12:27,819
Take it.

1719
01:12:31,919 --> 01:12:34,759
This is way too much cardio.

1720
01:12:38,659 --> 01:12:40,159

Amy, come on! Amy!

1731
01:13:40,289 --> 01:13:42,289
Sweet baby Jesus!

1732
01:13:45,789 --> 01:13:47,359
Amy, let's go!

1733
01:13:52,329 --> 01:13:55,319
- Amy, come on!
- Patricia!

1734
01:13:55,329 --> 01:13:57,169
Stop her!

1735
01:14:08,179 --> 01:14:10,269
- Beca! Beca!
- Amy!

1736
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:13,809
Hey, you've been a very
naughty girl, Turnip Top!

1737
01:14:13,819 --> 01:14:15,209
Amy! Amy!

1738
01:14:15,219 --> 01:14:17,049
Amy!

1739
01:14:22,429 --> 01:14:26,799
I rained hellfire!

1740
01:14:41,209 --> 01:14:42,769
The MPs arrested Amy's dad.

1741
01:14:42,779 --> 01:14:44,209
He's going to jail
for a long time.

1742
01:14:44,219 --> 01:14:45,869
I'm gonna go meet them,
all right?

1743
01:14:45,879 --> 01:14:47,319
- Okay.
- Sit tight.

1744
01:14:48,389 --> 01:14:50,209
I have no idea
what just happened,

1745
01:14:50,219 --> 01:14:52,749
but if Khaled doesn't pick us
after all of that,

1746
01:14:52,759 --> 01:14:54,279
what are we doing
with our lives?

1747
01:14:54,289 --> 01:14:56,789
- Right? - I know.
- Mm-hmm. - Seriously.

1748
01:14:56,799 --> 01:14:58,089
Uh, I think Beca has something

1749
01:14:58,099 --> 01:15:00,229
she'd like to share
with the group.

1750
01:15:01,299 --> 01:15:03,189
Um, thanks, Amy.

1751
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:04,389
Uh, yeah.

1752
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:07,959
I was gonna say something
earlier, but we were involved

1753
01:15:07,969 --> 01:15:09,999
in a hostage crisis,
so I just...

1754
01:15:10,009 --> 01:15:11,239
They picked her.

1755
01:15:12,379 --> 01:15:14,239
DJ Khaled and his team.

1756
01:15:14,249 --> 01:15:15,499
They didn't pick the Bellas.

1757
01:15:15,509 --> 01:15:17,369
They picked Beca.

1758
01:15:17,379 --> 01:15:19,439
So they... yeah,
so they only picked her.

1759
01:15:19,449 --> 01:15:22,779
Yeah, but I said no because
I feel exactly how you feel.

1760
01:15:22,789 --> 01:15:25,809
You guys are family, and you
don't walk away from family.

1761
01:15:25,819 --> 01:15:27,509
Don't you want to make music?

1762
01:15:27,519 --> 01:15:29,079
No, I guess, but...

1763
01:15:29,089 --> 01:15:31,749
Beca, you can't say no.
You've gotta do it.

1764
01:15:31,759 --> 01:15:34,049
Look, your real family
doesn't hold you back.

1765
01:15:34,059 --> 01:15:35,999
They lift you up.

1766
01:15:37,539 --> 01:15:40,029
Kind of feel like I've been
saying something to that effect

1767
01:15:40,039 --> 01:15:41,359
- the entire time.
- Oh, my God, Emily!

1768
01:15:41,369 --> 01:15:44,259
Smart people
are talking right now.

1769
01:15:44,269 --> 01:15:46,369
Aubrey, don't, please.

1770
01:15:46,379 --> 01:15:48,369
It's... I-I won't do it.
It's not important.

1771
01:15:48,379 --> 01:15:49,569
No, no, no.
It's-it's not that.

1772
01:15:49,579 --> 01:15:52,509
You know, I have
to be honest with you guys.

1773
01:15:52,519 --> 01:15:56,109
Every time I perform
in front of people,

1774
01:15:56,119 --> 01:15:58,279
I feel like I'm gonna puke.

1775
01:15:58,289 --> 01:16:00,549
And I don't have to anymore.

1776
01:16:00,559 --> 01:16:03,419
I'm so happy.

1777
01:16:03,429 --> 01:16:05,549
- Aw.
- Yes!

1778
01:16:05,559 --> 01:16:07,289
- No more puking.
- Whew!

1779
01:16:07,299 --> 01:16:09,059
- No more puke.
- No more puke.

1780
01:16:09,069 --> 01:16:10,319
Yes.

1781
01:16:10,329 --> 01:16:12,429
You know what?
I think I might just...

1782
01:16:12,439 --> 01:16:16,359
I don't know, move to Mykonos
and become a doula.

1783
01:16:16,369 --> 01:16:18,899
- A doula?
- A birthing coach.

1784
01:16:18,909 --> 01:16:20,929
- You gonna coach babies?
- Mm-hmm.

1785
01:16:20,939 --> 01:16:22,449
Yeah, I'll be like...

1786
01:16:23,879 --> 01:16:25,869
"Come here, little guy.
You can do it.

1787
01:16:25,879 --> 01:16:27,339
"There ain't really
nothing to it.

1788
01:16:27,349 --> 01:16:29,509
You can do it,
you can do it. Come on!"

1789
01:16:29,519 --> 01:16:31,279
- Ah...
- Now that gay people

1790
01:16:31,289 --> 01:16:34,079
can serve in the military,
I'm-a join the Air Force

1791
01:16:34,089 --> 01:16:36,149
and let them pay
for my flight school.

1792
01:16:36,159 --> 01:16:40,119
I have my Abnormal Psych exam
coming up next week.

1793
01:16:40,129 --> 01:16:42,389
But also, you're gonna
keep writing

1794
01:16:42,399 --> 01:16:45,989
so your life isn't filled
with crushing regret, right?

1795
01:16:45,999 --> 01:16:47,889
- Yes.
- Good.

1796
01:16:47,899 --> 01:16:49,329
Well, guys, a music career

1797
01:16:49,339 --> 01:16:51,399
would interfere
with my business, so...

1798
01:16:51,409 --> 01:16:54,569
Yeah, that little tiny
juice truck you work at.

1799
01:16:54,579 --> 01:16:55,969
The juice truck I own

1800
01:16:55,979 --> 01:16:58,199
and just secured capital
to franchise.

1801
01:16:58,209 --> 01:17:00,239
- So... - EMILY: Uh, what?
- Oh! - Cool.

1802
01:17:00,249 --> 01:17:03,379
- I didn't tell you guys?
- Congratulations.

1803
01:17:03,389 --> 01:17:04,949
Cool beans.

1804
01:17:05,949 --> 01:17:07,349
You talk?

1805
01:17:08,359 --> 01:17:10,949
Satan has finally left my body.

1806
01:17:10,959 --> 01:17:14,289
Hi. I'm Esther.

1807
01:17:14,299 --> 01:17:16,959
- Wha...?
- I have many questions.

1808
01:17:16,969 --> 01:17:19,989
You guys?

1809
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:22,259
I think it's time that we go on

1810
01:17:22,269 --> 01:17:24,359
with the next chapter
of our lives.

1811
01:17:24,369 --> 01:17:28,199
It's time for us to move on.
You know?

1812
01:17:28,209 --> 01:17:30,539
I mean, we're always gonna
be there for each other

1813
01:17:30,549 --> 01:17:32,439
because we're family.

1814
01:17:32,449 --> 01:17:35,109
And, I mean, I, for one,
am very ready.

1815
01:17:35,119 --> 01:17:37,379
I got the call that I got
into vet school.

1816
01:17:37,389 --> 01:17:39,479
- You got in!
- Yes, I got in. I know.

1817
01:17:39,489 --> 01:17:42,449
- No way! - Oh!
- I got in. I'm a vet.

1818
01:17:42,459 --> 01:17:44,479
Congratulations!

1819
01:17:44,489 --> 01:17:46,149
What about you, Ames?

1820
01:17:46,159 --> 01:17:47,949
You sure you're cool with this?

1821
01:17:47,959 --> 01:17:49,089
Are you kidding me?

1822
01:17:49,099 --> 01:17:51,319
I just found out
I got $180 million

1823
01:17:51,329 --> 01:17:53,519
to put into
"Fat Amy Winehouse."

1824
01:17:53,529 --> 01:17:54,389
- What?
- Yeah.

1825
01:17:54,399 --> 01:17:58,259
- Whoa.
- Wait, I could do more shows.

1826
01:17:58,269 --> 01:18:01,399
"Fat Amy Adams."
"Fat Amy Grant."

1827
01:18:01,409 --> 01:18:03,129
Oh, that would be good
for Christmas.

1828
01:18:03,139 --> 01:18:04,229
Would be great.

1829
01:18:04,239 --> 01:18:07,069
- Beca.
- Don't.

1830
01:18:07,079 --> 01:18:09,169
I swear to God,
don't make that face.

1831
01:18:09,179 --> 01:18:12,239
If you cry, I'm gonna cry.
I swear.

1832
01:18:12,249 --> 01:18:14,009
I'm not gonna do this
with you today, so...

1833
01:18:14,019 --> 01:18:15,279
- I'm not doing it.
- I hate that face.

1834
01:18:15,289 --> 01:18:17,049
- I'm not.
- Don't make that face.

1835
01:18:17,059 --> 01:18:18,619
- Don't.
- This is my regular face.

1836
01:18:18,629 --> 01:18:20,079
You know how much I love you.

1837
01:18:20,089 --> 01:18:23,449
You just get out there,
and you crush it.

1838
01:18:23,459 --> 01:18:24,519
Okay?

1839
01:18:24,529 --> 01:18:26,289
You crush it so hard

1840
01:18:26,299 --> 01:18:29,189
that your nips tingle a bit.

1841
01:18:29,199 --> 01:18:30,389
- She loves hugs.
- Don't. - Bring it in.

1842
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:31,699
- That's not funny.
- We should give her one.

1843
01:18:31,709 --> 01:18:35,569

- Hugger!

of the USO Tour
in the South of France,

1854
01:18:59,229 --> 01:19:00,719
coming to you from the Citadel.

1855
01:19:00,729 --> 01:19:04,329
What a gorgeous setting
here tonight under the stars.

1856
01:19:04,339 --> 01:19:06,089
Isn't this beautiful?
Doing a wonderful

1857
01:19:06,099 --> 01:19:08,199
musical presentation
in a bunker.

1858
01:19:08,209 --> 01:19:09,429
In the South of France.

1859
01:19:09,439 --> 01:19:11,229
I mean, it's so romantic here.

1860
01:19:11,239 --> 01:19:12,699
I've never been to France.

1861
01:19:12,709 --> 01:19:14,199
I hope never to come back.

1862
01:19:14,209 --> 01:19:15,599
Oh, no, it's not
a place for you.

1863
01:19:15,609 --> 01:19:17,569
Oh, no, no.
There's no good people here.

1864
01:19:17,579 --> 01:19:18,609
No, no.

1865
01:19:18,619 --> 01:19:19,739
On your toes, folks.

1866
01:19:19,749 --> 01:19:22,159
We're on in ten.
First positions.

1867
01:19:27,559 --> 01:19:29,349
Ladies and gentlemen,

1868
01:19:29,359 --> 01:19:33,529
let's give it up for DJ Khaled!

1869
01:19:37,069 --> 01:19:40,099
When I say "fan,"
you say "love."

1870
01:19:40,109 --> 01:19:41,199
Fan!

1871
01:19:41,209 --> 01:19:42,559
- Love!

1872

Love!

1873
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:45,099
First of all, I want to thank

1874
01:19:45,109 --> 01:19:47,099
all the troops
for coming out here.

1875
01:19:47,109 --> 01:19:48,639

1878
01:19:52,249 --> 01:19:54,609
But tonight I have a surprise.

1879
01:19:54,619 --> 01:19:59,109
I'll be introducing you
to a new star.

1880
01:19:59,119 --> 01:20:00,349
A superstar.

1881
01:20:00,359 --> 01:20:03,419
Somebody that I have cosigned.

1882
01:20:03,429 --> 01:20:06,049

1883
01:20:06,059 --> 01:20:08,199
Beca Mitchell.

1884
01:20:10,799 --> 01:20:14,299

stepping onto the stage,

1885
01:20:14,309 --> 01:20:16,699

the day she was born.

1886
01:20:16,709 --> 01:20:19,469

this little sprite-light lady

1887
01:20:19,479 --> 01:20:21,799
for, I don't know,
seven years now, I think.

1888
01:20:21,809 --> 01:20:23,539
We have been showing you

1889
01:20:23,549 --> 01:20:25,709
her new life
out in the real world,

1890
01:20:25,719 --> 01:20:28,339
where she's out to take
another perfectly good job

1891
01:20:28,349 --> 01:20:29,689
