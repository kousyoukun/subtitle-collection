Today's the day.
We're getting her today.

24
00:02:45,054 --> 00:02:46,187
Is your sound equipment
working? Because...

25
00:02:46,189 --> 00:02:47,321
You don't worry
about what I'm doing.

26
00:02:47,323 --> 00:02:49,290
- Oh, my God. She's right there. I got her.
- Shh, shh.

27
00:02:49,292 --> 00:02:51,892
- Here, get in here.
- All right. Got it.

28
00:02:51,894 --> 00:02:53,728
They were world champions.

29
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,963
The winningest a cappella group
of all time.

30
00:02:55,965 --> 00:02:59,066
The Barden Bellas,
an unlikely group of not-men

31
00:02:59,068 --> 00:03:01,101
who somehow managed to win
at something

32
00:03:01,103 --> 00:03:02,771
that didn't have to do
with baking.

33
00:03:02,773 --> 00:03:04,205
- I can hear you guys.
- You know, girlie,

34
00:03:04,207 --> 00:03:06,141
you're this close to being
cut out of this d'aca'mentary.

35
00:03:06,143 --> 00:03:07,808
So close.
You're in the danger zone.

36
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,677
We have security,
and I carry mace.

37
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:13,615
We're gonna be clinging to you
like mom jeans to a camel toe.

Mm, mm, mm, mm, whoa.

47
00:03:32,234 --> 00:03:35,770
You produced the shit out
of his turd-burger.

48
00:03:35,772 --> 00:03:38,039
Thanks. I mean, it's better.

49
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:40,241
- Who's that singing?
- Oh, that's me, but we've got time

50
00:03:40,243 --> 00:03:42,210
to get a real singer.
I have a couple thoughts.

51
00:03:42,212 --> 00:03:45,779
- I think it's very...
- Yo. Yo, can we turn this off?

52
00:03:45,781 --> 00:03:48,148
Pimp-Lo, bam, bam, bam.

53
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:51,685
I mean,
you have done it again.

54
00:03:51,687 --> 00:03:55,155
- "Bend Over" is so...
- So good.

55
00:03:55,157 --> 00:03:56,925
I feel like my ears
are hearing the future.

56
00:03:56,927 --> 00:03:58,292
- Club banger.
- Yeah, I hate it.

57
00:03:58,294 --> 00:03:59,393
I really hate it.

58
00:03:59,395 --> 00:04:00,996
I'm the artist,

59
00:04:00,998 --> 00:04:03,297
and this is my song,
and I feel like

60
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:06,234

70
00:04:23,019 --> 00:04:26,186
to make you the best little
Pimp-Lo that you can be,

71
00:04:26,188 --> 00:04:29,157
and-and I want to get behind
"Bend Over."

72
00:04:29,159 --> 00:04:31,993
And, as your producer, I would
love it if you could trust me.

73
00:04:31,995 --> 00:04:34,328
I would love it if you leave
my track how it is.

74
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:37,065
I made your song great, man.

75
00:04:37,067 --> 00:04:38,700
I think what she means is,

76
00:04:38,702 --> 00:04:40,034
your song was always great.

77
00:04:40,036 --> 00:04:41,902
No, what I mean
is what you gave me

78
00:04:41,904 --> 00:04:43,404
- was a steaming pile of...
- Pimp-Lo!

79
00:04:43,406 --> 00:04:46,207
Okay. There's something
that you should know.

80
00:04:46,209 --> 00:04:48,876
Uh, Beca...

81
00:04:48,878 --> 00:04:50,911
- is on her period.
- Wow.

82
00:04:50,913 --> 00:04:53,181
- Oh, it's shark week? Hot damn.
- Bum-bum.

83
00:04:53,183 --> 00:04:55,683
Y'all keepin' it one hundred.
That's my moms right there.

84
00:04:55,685 --> 00:04:56,618
- You know what it is.
- Mm-hmm.

85
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,852
- Still menstruating? Hmm.
- Okay. - Truth.

86
00:04:58,854 --> 00:05:01,823
If you could just
excuse us for a second.

87
00:05:01,825 --> 00:05:02,890
What are you doing?

88
00:05:02,892 --> 00:05:04,291
How can you take his side?

89
00:05:04,293 --> 00:05:05,926
Sides? Well, we...

90
00:05:05,928 --> 00:05:07,361
Why are we always talking
about sides?

91
00:05:07,363 --> 00:05:09,263
Okay, it's our job, brah.

92
00:05:09,265 --> 00:05:10,364
We're producers.

93
00:05:10,366 --> 00:05:13,334
We bring his vision to life.

94
00:05:13,336 --> 00:05:16,303
Damn! That's poppin'!

95
00:05:16,305 --> 00:05:19,342
Hey!

96
00:05:21,344 --> 00:05:22,810
I did it.

97
00:05:22,812 --> 00:05:24,445
I finally quit my job.

98
00:05:24,447 --> 00:05:27,815
And I'm free, I'm free.
I'm never going back

99
00:05:27,817 --> 00:05:29,416
to that job again.

100
00:05:29,418 --> 00:05:32,087
It's the best day of my life.
I mean, I can't be

101
00:05:32,089 --> 00:05:33,354
a music producer
without integrity.

102
00:05:33,356 --> 00:05:34,888
What's up?

103
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,024
What?

104
00:05:36,026 --> 00:05:37,459
Wait. S-Something's wrong.

105
00:05:37,461 --> 00:05:39,960
Your face is more pinched
than normal.

106
00:05:39,962 --> 00:05:41,328
I-I finally did it.

107
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:43,464
You got back together
with Jesse?

108
00:05:43,466 --> 00:05:46,366
No! You know the long-distance
thing didn't work.

109
00:05:46,368 --> 00:05:49,837
He lives 3,000 miles away
with his girlfriend

110
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:51,205
- and their cat.
- Oh.

111
00:05:51,207 --> 00:05:53,308
He got over you much quicker
than what I thought.

112
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:56,010
- Oh, thank you, Amy.
- Much faster than Bumper,

113
00:05:56,012 --> 00:05:58,313
who is rightfully
still devastated.

114
00:05:58,315 --> 00:06:01,149
You know he got a tattoo
of me on his butt cheek?

115
00:06:01,151 --> 00:06:05,219
So now, every time he wants
to see me, he's like...

116
00:06:05,221 --> 00:06:06,320
He's just...

117
00:06:06,322 --> 00:06:08,222
- Okay. Um...
- That made me dizzy.

118
00:06:08,224 --> 00:06:10,959
- Wait, what's up?
- I quit my job.

119
00:06:10,961 --> 00:06:13,193
- You got fired?
- Oh, come on.

120
00:06:13,195 --> 00:06:14,462
All right.
I-I didn't get fired.

121
00:06:14,464 --> 00:06:15,529
- I quit.
- Come here.

122
00:06:15,531 --> 00:06:17,332
You're kind of making it worse.

123
00:06:17,334 --> 00:06:19,334
Let this negative energy
be released!

124
00:06:19,336 --> 00:06:21,503
Seriously, open your legs.
It'll come out quicker.

125
00:06:21,505 --> 00:06:23,171
- No, no.
- It'll come out quicker,

126
00:06:23,173 --> 00:06:25,106
- the bad energy.
- Why do you do this stuff?

127
00:06:25,108 --> 00:06:26,407
- Okay, seriously.
- Why are you like this?

128
00:06:26,409 --> 00:06:28,810
- You're gonna come back from this so fast.
- Mm.

129
00:06:28,812 --> 00:06:32,279
You know why? Because you have
an amazing best friend.

130
00:06:32,281 --> 00:06:33,448
Is that you?

131
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:34,548
Yeah.

132
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,017
- Okay.
- And also...

133
00:06:36,019 --> 00:06:38,286
You need to pay the rent.

134
00:06:38,288 --> 00:06:39,854
Just a little.

135
00:06:39,856 --> 00:06:41,923
Uh, every month,
we have to do it. Ugh.

136
00:06:41,925 --> 00:06:42,991
Right.

137
00:06:42,993 --> 00:06:44,024
Yeah.

138
00:06:44,026 --> 00:06:45,426
You could get a job, you know.

139
00:06:45,428 --> 00:06:47,561
Beca, you're in shock.

140
00:06:47,563 --> 00:06:49,296
You need something to eat.

141
00:06:49,298 --> 00:06:50,330
- Yeah. Just sit down.
- Oh.

142
00:06:50,332 --> 00:06:52,801
Not these, though.
They're mine.

143
00:06:52,803 --> 00:06:55,135
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Chloe!

144
00:06:55,137 --> 00:06:56,303
Why aren't you guys ready?

145
00:06:56,305 --> 00:06:58,306
Why are you wearing that?

146
00:06:58,308 --> 00:07:00,108
- What?
- Did you wear that to work?

147
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:03,378
- Yeah, underneath my scrubs.
- Well, sweetie, why?

148
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,346
Because it reminds me
I was special once.

149
00:07:05,348 --> 00:07:09,383
But also because tonight
is, you... you know...

150
00:07:09,385 --> 00:07:14,087
the Bellas reunion
at the Brooklyn Aquarium.

151
00:07:14,089 --> 00:07:15,522
- Hello!
- That's tonight?

152
00:07:15,524 --> 00:07:17,157
- Yes. - Aw, yeah!
- You know what?

153
00:07:17,159 --> 00:07:18,226
I will take it.
I need a distraction anyway.

154
00:07:18,228 --> 00:07:21,361
- Yeah. Yes, you do! Whoo!
- I love it. Here we go!

155
00:07:21,363 --> 00:07:22,195
What happened?

156
00:07:22,197 --> 00:07:24,599
- She got fired today.
- No.

157
00:07:30,106 --> 00:07:32,106
- Hey, Stacie.
- Oh, my God!

158
00:07:32,108 --> 00:07:35,443
- Finally!
- Aw. Good to see you.

159
00:07:35,445 --> 00:07:37,077
What's up, pitches?

160
00:07:39,082 --> 00:07:41,616
- I know, I know.
- Hi, Beca. - Oh!

161
00:07:41,618 --> 00:07:42,517
I missed you guys so much.

162
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:44,351
I can't wait for us
to sing together.

163
00:07:44,353 --> 00:07:45,053
I'm so excited.

164
00:07:45,055 --> 00:07:46,486
Hey, ladies.

165
00:07:46,488 --> 00:07:48,056
Let's crush this.

166
00:07:48,058 --> 00:07:50,291
- Hi. - Hello.
- Stacie!

167
00:07:50,293 --> 00:07:51,125
Hi!

168
00:07:51,127 --> 00:07:52,594
Hey, Bellas.

169
00:07:52,596 --> 00:07:53,928
- Hi!
- Hi!

170
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,597
Thank you so much
for inviting us.

171
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,132
- Of course.
- So, what do you want us to sing tonight?

172
00:07:58,134 --> 00:07:59,467
A little "Who Run the World,"
some "Bulletproof"?

173
00:07:59,469 --> 00:08:01,202
You didn't tell us
what the crowd was,

174
00:08:01,204 --> 00:08:02,637
- but I, um...
- What's she talking about?

175
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,339
I brought this, just in case.

176
00:08:04,341 --> 00:08:06,573
- Oh, God.
- Our voices are warm.

177
00:08:09,378 --> 00:08:13,248
Um, we didn't
invite you guys to sing.

178
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,315
We invited you to...

179
00:08:15,317 --> 00:08:18,419
- watch us sing.
- Watch.

180
00:08:18,421 --> 00:08:20,654
Aca-scuse me?

181
00:08:20,656 --> 00:08:23,123

were so busy with your...

You guys, I am so sorry.

264
00:11:43,792 --> 00:11:45,860
I realize I should not have
used the word "reunion."

265
00:11:45,862 --> 00:11:48,563
I should have said that it was
an excuse to see each other.

266
00:11:48,565 --> 00:11:49,831
I really didn't think that out.

- No, no, no.

You guys were so great.

269
00:11:52,334 --> 00:11:53,800
And this was
a really nice chance

270
00:11:53,802 --> 00:11:54,869
for us to get together.

271
00:11:54,871 --> 00:11:56,103
Right, ladies?

272
00:11:56,105 --> 00:11:58,438
- Yeah, sure.
- Oh, yes.

273
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,207
Oh, yes, really great.

274
00:12:00,209 --> 00:12:01,509
- So great.
- Thank you so much.

275
00:12:01,511 --> 00:12:04,444
I was supposed to go
to my brother's wedding,

276
00:12:04,446 --> 00:12:06,880
- but this is nice, too.
- Aw.

277
00:12:06,882 --> 00:12:08,850
- Yeah.
- Bellas, a toast.

278
00:12:08,852 --> 00:12:11,119
- There!
- Toast! Yay!

279
00:12:11,121 --> 00:12:12,486
To the most amazing

280
00:12:12,488 --> 00:12:15,289
group of women
I have ever known.

281
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:17,324
I would do anything

282
00:12:17,326 --> 00:12:18,893
to sing with you guys again.

283
00:12:18,895 --> 00:12:20,760
Anything!

284
00:12:20,762 --> 00:12:24,265
I mean, really,
I could just crap myself!

285
00:12:24,267 --> 00:12:25,298
- Oh.
- Uh-uh.

286
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,502
Cheers.

287
00:12:28,504 --> 00:12:30,505
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I'm having a crazy idea.

288
00:12:30,507 --> 00:12:32,573
Okay, I've mentioned
that my dad is in the Army

289
00:12:32,575 --> 00:12:34,475
and, like, basically killed
Osama bin Laden, right?

290
00:12:34,477 --> 00:12:36,510
Some new information
in that sentence, but okay.

291
00:12:36,512 --> 00:12:38,645
Well, what I mean is, he's
kind of a big deal in the Army.

292
00:12:38,647 --> 00:12:41,314
And every year, the USO
puts on this performance

293
00:12:41,316 --> 00:12:42,817
to entertain
and support the troops.

294
00:12:42,819 --> 00:12:45,720
And this year,
DJ Khaled is hosting.

295
00:12:45,722 --> 00:12:47,355
He's got, like,
a gazillion hit songs,

296
00:12:47,357 --> 00:12:49,189
and he's super famous.

297
00:12:49,191 --> 00:12:51,491
I saw him on a tax commercial.

298
00:12:51,493 --> 00:12:53,727
What if I could get us
an invite?

299
00:12:53,729 --> 00:12:55,395
To sing?

300
00:12:55,397 --> 00:12:57,798
No, to run military dark ops.

301
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,401
Yes, of course, to sing.

302
00:13:01,403 --> 00:13:03,471
Is there a competition?

303
00:13:03,473 --> 00:13:04,672
There should always be
a competition.

304
00:13:04,674 --> 00:13:07,842
Oh, um...
well, well, no, but...

305
00:13:07,844 --> 00:13:09,943
let's sing together again.

306
00:13:09,945 --> 00:13:12,380
And... and maybe
I'll see my dad.

307
00:13:12,382 --> 00:13:14,515
Or maybe I won't,
you know, because he has

308
00:13:14,517 --> 00:13:16,284
something really important
to do.

309
00:13:16,286 --> 00:13:17,952
Or maybe I'll be
the most important thing

310
00:13:17,954 --> 00:13:20,188
in his life this time.

311
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,291
Maybe.

312
00:13:23,926 --> 00:13:26,327
- Who's with me?
- Me. Mm-hmm.

313
00:13:26,329 --> 00:13:29,963
Yeah. I suddenly have a lot
of free time, so hell yeah.

314
00:13:29,965 --> 00:13:32,299
Well, I just got
kicked out of flight school

315
00:13:32,301 --> 00:13:33,967
for killing 300 fake people.

316
00:13:33,969 --> 00:13:36,904
- I hate fake people.
- I hate a fake bitch.

317
00:13:36,906 --> 00:13:39,774
Can you fly when
you're eight months pregnant?

318
00:13:39,776 --> 00:13:41,576
- What?
- No.

319
00:13:41,578 --> 00:13:42,443
Um...

320
00:13:42,445 --> 00:13:44,444
- Look.
- Oh...

321
00:13:44,446 --> 00:13:46,213
That's...
that's eight months pregnant?

322
00:13:46,215 --> 00:13:47,715
You guys didn't notice?

323
00:13:47,717 --> 00:13:49,217
- Well, congratulations.
- Oh, my God.

324
00:13:49,219 --> 00:13:51,651
Ah!

325
00:13:51,653 --> 00:13:53,721
- I mean, I'm so happy for you.
- Amazing! - Wow.

326
00:13:53,723 --> 00:13:55,356
Do you know who the father is?

327
00:13:55,358 --> 00:13:56,457
Eh.

328
00:13:56,459 --> 00:13:57,725
- Oh. - Oh.
- Congratulations.

329
00:13:57,727 --> 00:13:59,659
Happy accidents.

330
00:13:59,661 --> 00:14:02,295
Okay, well, Stacie's out.

331
00:14:02,297 --> 00:14:04,865
So I guess, Emily, you're in.

332
00:14:04,867 --> 00:14:07,000
- Oh, yeah. I'm in for sure.
- Yeah!

333
00:14:07,002 --> 00:14:08,736
Yay.

334
00:14:08,738 --> 00:14:11,606
- Was I not always in?
- Um...

335
00:14:11,608 --> 00:14:12,973
- Oh, no, no, no. Of course.
- Yes.

336
00:14:12,975 --> 00:14:14,007
Oh, cool. I... Okay.

337
00:14:14,009 --> 00:14:16,611

<i>Hola, señoritas.</i>

347
00:14:47,276 --> 00:14:48,909
Where'd you guys
even come from?

348
00:14:48,911 --> 00:14:50,577
A little town called
Persistence, sweet cheeks.

349
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:51,779
That's right.
Here, here's the thing.

00:14:53,349 --> 00:14:54,649
All-access passes.

352
00:14:54,651 --> 00:14:56,884
We're tall enough
for all the rides.

353
00:14:56,886 --> 00:14:59,720
You can run,
but you cannot hide.

This d'aca'mentary
is happening!

355

We're gonna film
this whole thing.

00:15:02,858 --> 00:15:03,725
It's gonna be beautiful.

357
00:15:03,727 --> 00:15:05,025
We're making a beautiful
d'aca'mentary.

358
00:15:05,027 --> 00:15:06,394
In fact, we gotta set up.

359

Where are we gonna
set up, John?

360
00:15:07,463 --> 00:15:08,462

Welcome to Spain, Bellas.

367
00:15:26,815 --> 00:15:28,548
A few important things
to note before we begin.

368
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:30,717
Grab your luggage.

369
00:15:30,719 --> 00:15:32,787
All right, thank you.

370
00:15:32,789 --> 00:15:34,922
You always want
to stay 25 feet...

371
00:15:39,961 --> 00:15:41,962
...choke.

372
00:15:41,964 --> 00:15:45,366
...very sharp. We do not
want you to impale yourself.

373
00:15:46,636 --> 00:15:48,903
I hope you all heard
each and every word,

374
00:15:48,905 --> 00:15:51,975
or else you might
very well end up dead.

375
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,576
Ladies, I'm messing with you.

376
00:15:55,578 --> 00:15:57,812
On behalf of the Department
of Defense, we would like

377
00:15:57,814 --> 00:16:00,114
to welcome you to
Naval Air Station Rota, Spain.

378
00:16:00,116 --> 00:16:02,582
And a sincere thank-you
for coming out to entertain

379
00:16:02,584 --> 00:16:03,818
our troops and their families.

380
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,452
We're excited for this tour.

381
00:16:05,454 --> 00:16:07,053
My name's Chicago.
Over here to my left

382
00:16:07,055 --> 00:16:09,490
is Captain Bernie,
who we like to call Zeke.

383
00:16:09,492 --> 00:16:11,925
- Ladies.
- We're gonna be with you the whole tour

384
00:16:11,927 --> 00:16:13,794
- as your escorts and security details.
- Question.

385
00:16:13,796 --> 00:16:15,831
Will we all be
showering together?

386
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,869
Uh, first up is a sound check.

387
00:16:21,871 --> 00:16:25,039
We'll have you back
to the hotel by 1430.

388
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:26,606
Maybe hit the rain locker,

389
00:16:26,608 --> 00:16:29,476
back here for the big show
at 1700. Yeah.

390
00:16:29,478 --> 00:16:32,882
1700... is that,
like, later than the night?

391
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,015
It's 5:00.

392
00:16:35,017 --> 00:16:36,549
Okay. Whatever.

393
00:16:36,551 --> 00:16:38,852
- Okay... Yep.
- Question, question.

394
00:16:38,854 --> 00:16:40,888
Um, so this is the first base.

395
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:43,760
Will we be going to second base
with you guys?

396
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,727
And then,
maybe a few days later,

397
00:16:47,729 --> 00:16:49,697
we'll go to third base?

398
00:16:49,699 --> 00:16:51,798
That's a "no" for me, so...

399
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,134
Wait, what's after
the third base?

400
00:16:53,136 --> 00:16:55,101
Why don't we get you
to your first venue?

401
00:16:55,103 --> 00:16:56,603
Come on.

402
00:16:56,605 --> 00:16:58,773
All right, well, we are

403
00:16:58,775 --> 00:17:00,006
really excited
to have you here.

404
00:17:00,008 --> 00:17:01,641
Right now
we're in Hangar Three.

405
00:17:01,643 --> 00:17:03,677
This is where we keep
all of our helicopters.

406
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:05,545
Of course, now we've got
the big stage

407
00:17:05,547 --> 00:17:07,046
built up for the tour.

408
00:17:07,048 --> 00:17:09,850
So, on the tour,
we've got three bands.

409
00:17:09,852 --> 00:17:11,752
Over here, we got Saddle Up.

410
00:17:11,754 --> 00:17:14,522
This is Young Sparrow
and DJ Dragon Nutz.

411
00:17:14,524 --> 00:17:16,657
And behind me is Evermoist.

412
00:17:16,659 --> 00:17:18,124
Oh!

413
00:17:18,126 --> 00:17:20,527
And check it out.
DJ Khaled just rolled in.

414
00:17:20,529 --> 00:17:21,728
Let's set the stage,
all right?

415
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:22,796
- Let's get ready before the...
- So we should turn around

416
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:24,765
- and shoot into it, I think.
- ...the Bellas out.

417
00:17:24,767 --> 00:17:25,765
- Get the Bellas...
- Hey, guys.

418
00:17:25,767 --> 00:17:26,934
Come say hey to the new group.

419
00:17:26,936 --> 00:17:28,535
- Yo. - Hi.
- Oh.

420
00:17:28,537 --> 00:17:30,970
Hello. We're the Bellas,

421
00:17:30,972 --> 00:17:34,007
formerly of Barden University
and currently of life.

422
00:17:34,009 --> 00:17:35,909
- Ladies.
- Howdy.

423
00:17:35,911 --> 00:17:37,111
- Hey. - Hey.
- Ladies, I want

424
00:17:37,113 --> 00:17:38,512
to give you
a little forewarning.

425
00:17:38,514 --> 00:17:39,979
My man's social anxiety,

426
00:17:39,981 --> 00:17:42,082
when he's not behind the
turntables, it's kind of crazy.

427
00:17:42,084 --> 00:17:44,951
- So be easy, all right?
- Hello. - Hi.

428
00:17:44,953 --> 00:17:46,586
♪ Hello ♪

429
00:17:46,588 --> 00:17:50,623
♪ Is it me
you're looking for? ♪

430
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,759
Right on. I'm Calamity.

431
00:17:52,761 --> 00:17:55,161
This is Serenity,
Veracity and Charity.

432
00:17:55,163 --> 00:17:56,130
- Hi. - Hey.
- Hi.

433
00:17:56,132 --> 00:17:59,166
If I joined your group,
I could be Obesity.

434
00:18:00,135 --> 00:18:02,203
- Get it?
- Oh, if you're wondering,

435
00:18:02,205 --> 00:18:04,170
- our presence here has nothing to do with...
- Nothing.

436
00:18:04,172 --> 00:18:06,506
...the nationally televised
"Salute to the Troops" special

437
00:18:06,508 --> 00:18:09,543
where DJ Khaled is going to
pick one group to open for him

438
00:18:09,545 --> 00:18:10,710
at the end of this tour.

439
00:18:10,712 --> 00:18:12,813
That was a lot of exposition.

440
00:18:12,815 --> 00:18:14,982
So there is a competition.

441
00:18:14,984 --> 00:18:16,484
I knew it.

442
00:18:16,486 --> 00:18:18,919
- And so there is.
- Idiots!

443
00:18:18,921 --> 00:18:19,986
What, do you think we

444
00:18:19,988 --> 00:18:21,589
care about just watching
you guys?

445
00:18:21,591 --> 00:18:23,122
It's a competition! Hello!

446
00:18:23,124 --> 00:18:25,559
You guys just sing
other people's songs, right?

447
00:18:25,561 --> 00:18:27,861
- Like a cover band.
- No, no, no, no.

448
00:18:27,863 --> 00:18:28,996
- No.
- Uh, no, no, no. Uh, well,

449
00:18:28,998 --> 00:18:32,065
actually, Emily writes
original songs for the Bellas.

450
00:18:32,067 --> 00:18:33,734
I mean, I don't really
do it anymore.

451
00:18:33,736 --> 00:18:35,236
- I kind of did that one, and then I...
- Hey.

452
00:18:35,238 --> 00:18:37,237
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
You with us or against us?

453
00:18:37,239 --> 00:18:39,739
And it was one of your dads
who gave you

454
00:18:39,741 --> 00:18:41,274
the spot on the tour, right?

455
00:18:41,276 --> 00:18:43,276
- Oh, my God.
- Um...

456
00:18:43,278 --> 00:18:44,245
- Ooh...
- Guys, stop.

457
00:18:44,247 --> 00:18:45,746
They just don't like
sharing the spotlight,

458
00:18:45,748 --> 00:18:46,813
so they're trying
to intimidate us.

459
00:18:46,815 --> 00:18:48,983
Let's just take the high road
and do what we do.

460
00:18:48,985 --> 00:18:50,251
You thinking what I'm thinking?

461
00:18:50,253 --> 00:18:50,884
What are you thinking?

462
00:18:50,886 --> 00:18:51,886
A riff-off.

463
00:18:51,888 --> 00:18:54,755
- That's not what I was thinking.
- A riff-off!

464
00:18:54,757 --> 00:18:57,091
Wait. Yes.
A riff-off! Yes!

465
00:18:57,093 --> 00:18:58,892
- What is a riff-off?
- Yeah.

466
00:18:58,894 --> 00:19:00,226
A riff-off is a little game

467
00:19:00,228 --> 00:19:02,763
that we like to play
to see who's better.

468

and matched it
with the first word

497
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:30,016
of the new song,
but you stay on tempo,

498
00:20:30,018 --> 00:20:31,718
stay on beat,
stay on pitch and, of course,

00:25:53,308 --> 00:25:55,708
Well, don't give up.
My dad always says,

622
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:57,177
"Age wrinkles the body,

623
00:25:57,179 --> 00:25:59,713
but quitting
wrinkles the soul."

624
00:25:59,715 --> 00:26:01,284
Hmm.

625
00:26:02,584 --> 00:26:06,218
- Three...
- How about those Bulls?

626
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:08,588
Gotta love those Cubs.

627
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:12,525
And the deep dish pizza,
'cause it's so...

628
00:26:12,527 --> 00:26:14,063
deep.

629
00:26:14,595 --> 00:26:15,696
Chicago.

630
00:26:15,698 --> 00:26:16,996
Right?

631
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,632
Yeah, I'm actually
from Georgia.

632
00:26:19,634 --> 00:26:20,700
Oh.

633
00:26:20,702 --> 00:26:22,101
So, what's your story?

634
00:26:22,103 --> 00:26:23,236
Why are you here?

635
00:26:23,238 --> 00:26:25,037
Oh, boy. Um...

636
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,107
Long story short,
I was in the NG,

637
00:26:27,109 --> 00:26:30,243
but my CO recommended me
for OCS after, uh, AIT.

638
00:26:30,245 --> 00:26:33,080
Then came OBC
and RTB where I, uh,

639
00:26:33,082 --> 00:26:35,047
was the, uh, DG of my class.

640
00:26:35,049 --> 00:26:37,450
It's... I don't know.

641
00:26:37,452 --> 00:26:39,218
Sorry. Um...

642
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,987
I joined the National Guard.

643
00:26:40,989 --> 00:26:42,488
They helped put me
through college.

644
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:45,359
I spent about
a year stationed in Kabul.

645
00:26:45,361 --> 00:26:48,461
Uh, actually overseeing
a canine unit over there.

646
00:26:48,463 --> 00:26:50,030
We trained German shepherds,

647
00:26:50,032 --> 00:26:51,732
we trained pit bulls...

648
00:26:51,734 --> 00:26:53,600
Dogs.

649
00:26:53,602 --> 00:26:54,700
I love dogs.

650
00:26:54,702 --> 00:26:56,402
I love animals, in general.

651
00:26:56,404 --> 00:26:59,005
- Animals are cute.
- You're cute. I mean, what?

652
00:26:59,007 --> 00:27:01,073
- What about you?
- Me? Me.

653
00:27:01,075 --> 00:27:02,242
Uh, shorter story...

654
00:27:02,244 --> 00:27:04,611
I was in a singing group
in college,

655
00:27:04,613 --> 00:27:09,349
and then now I am still
in that same singing group,

656
00:27:09,351 --> 00:27:11,384
but not in college.

657
00:27:11,386 --> 00:27:12,651
- But you're committed.
- I am committed.

658
00:27:12,653 --> 00:27:14,121
- That's great.
- Yeah, I love commitment

659
00:27:14,123 --> 00:27:15,455
- and being committed.
- Yeah.

660
00:27:15,457 --> 00:27:17,390
- Not to, like, an asylum. Whoa.
- Right.

661
00:27:17,392 --> 00:27:18,792
Or, like, a hospital, like,
it's... I'm not saying...

662
00:27:18,794 --> 00:27:20,526
- Yeah, no, I know.
- But, like... just, I like...

663
00:27:20,528 --> 00:27:22,528
I love love.
I love being committed to love.

664
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:25,364
Not to you, but to, like...
I love, um, like, oranges.

665
00:27:25,366 --> 00:27:26,600
- Oranges.
- I love...

666
00:27:26,602 --> 00:27:28,735
Hey. Uh, girls?

667
00:27:28,737 --> 00:27:30,403
- Hmm?
- We have separate rooms. We don't have to

668
00:27:30,405 --> 00:27:31,537
sleep on top
of each other anymore.

669
00:27:31,539 --> 00:27:33,672
- What?
- Hey, that's great.

670
00:27:33,674 --> 00:27:35,242
Um, not sexually.

671
00:27:35,244 --> 00:27:36,713
There was that one time.

672
00:27:48,356 --> 00:27:50,424
Stop being so loud.

673
00:27:50,426 --> 00:27:52,225
- Yeah. No, yeah.
- Oh, that's what I want.

674
00:27:52,227 --> 00:27:53,459
Uh, no,
that's the molasses one.

675
00:27:53,461 --> 00:27:55,161
No, you're not gonna
like that one.

676
00:27:55,163 --> 00:27:56,429
- This one.
- I don't want molasses.

677
00:27:56,431 --> 00:27:58,364
Okay, you guys,
so we've never

678
00:27:58,366 --> 00:28:00,332
competed against bands
that play actual instruments.

679
00:28:00,334 --> 00:28:01,467
What's the plan?

680
00:28:01,469 --> 00:28:04,371
I really think we should just
stay true to ourselves,

681
00:28:04,373 --> 00:28:06,573
- and it will all figure itself out.
- Emily?

682
00:28:06,575 --> 00:28:09,176
- Mm-hmm.
- Please hear this in the best way possible.

683
00:28:09,178 --> 00:28:10,843
You're a very stupid person.

684
00:28:10,845 --> 00:28:12,845
You know what?
Maybe it won't matter

685
00:28:12,847 --> 00:28:15,415
if we win or not, because
they will like us so much

686
00:28:15,417 --> 00:28:17,383
that they will invite us
to keep touring with them.

687
00:28:17,385 --> 00:28:19,252
And it won't matter
if I get into vet school

688
00:28:19,254 --> 00:28:20,853
because we will be together
as a family,

689
00:28:20,855 --> 00:28:22,456
supporting each other.

690
00:28:22,458 --> 00:28:24,293
And really, isn't that
what it's all about?

691
00:28:25,324 --> 00:28:26,293
- Yes.
- Yes.

692
00:28:26,295 --> 00:28:27,828
Yeah, except for all families
break apart,

693
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:31,801
and the only person you can
ever truly rely on is yourself.

694
00:28:34,469 --> 00:28:36,335
All right,
time to drop a smash.

695
00:28:36,337 --> 00:28:39,473
- What? - Oh, no, no, no.
- Whoo! - Wait.

696
00:28:39,475 --> 00:28:41,411
- Think it's a whole album.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:30:21,576 --> 00:30:23,442
You're English. Hi.

726
00:30:23,444 --> 00:30:25,844
That's right. I saw you do
the, uh, sound check,

727
00:30:25,846 --> 00:30:29,315
- um, thing that you guys...
- Yeah. The riff-off thing.

728
00:30:29,317 --> 00:30:30,550
- Riff-off.
- Yeah. I don't know why we

729
00:30:30,552 --> 00:30:31,784
keep challenging people
to those.

730
00:30:31,786 --> 00:30:33,320
We... we don't ever
actually win.

731
00:30:33,322 --> 00:30:35,322
- Oh.
- Do you work for the USO?

732
00:30:35,324 --> 00:30:37,390
Uh, no, I-I work for DJ Khaled.

733
00:30:37,392 --> 00:30:38,925
Sorry. I'm-I'm Theo.

734
00:30:38,927 --> 00:30:39,726
- Hi. I'm Beca.
- Hi.

735
00:30:39,728 --> 00:30:41,928
- Nice to meet you.
- How you doing?

736
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:42,728
Sorry, you are a...

737
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:44,363
- Oh, I'm a...
- Music executive?

738
00:30:44,365 --> 00:30:45,465
...music exec
at Khaled's label.

739
00:30:45,467 --> 00:30:46,699
- Really?
- Yeah.

740
00:30:46,701 --> 00:30:48,467
- What?
- No, I-I... I work

741
00:30:48,469 --> 00:30:49,869
with music executives,
and you...

742
00:30:49,871 --> 00:30:51,838
they... they don't look
like you.

743
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,005
Oh.

744
00:30:53,007 --> 00:30:55,675
What... what do I look like?

745
00:30:55,677 --> 00:30:56,575
A turtle.

746
00:30:56,577 --> 00:31:00,013
Well, that's in...
incredibly specific.

747
00:31:00,015 --> 00:31:01,948
But, like, you literally
look just like that.

748
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:03,382
No, no. It's accurate.

749
00:31:03,384 --> 00:31:04,618
You said you work
with music execs.

750
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:07,887
Oh. Yeah. Um, no, I'm a...

751
00:31:07,889 --> 00:31:09,421
I'm a music producer.

752
00:31:09,423 --> 00:31:10,990
I'm sort of freelancing
right now.

753
00:31:10,992 --> 00:31:12,659
Oh, and I sing for fun.

754
00:31:12,661 --> 00:31:15,262
I'm interested to see
the Bellas in action.

755
00:31:15,264 --> 00:31:18,631
Yeah, maybe we'll even open
for DJ Khaled in the end.

756
00:31:18,633 --> 00:31:20,667
You don't think
you'll open for Khaled?

757
00:31:20,669 --> 00:31:22,901
Uh, no, I-I...
I didn't say that.

758
00:31:22,903 --> 00:31:25,371
Yeah, you did. You did.
You just said it before.

759
00:31:25,373 --> 00:31:26,640
You kind of implied it,
if anything.

760
00:31:26,642 --> 00:31:27,974
- Well, I just...
- I could just

761
00:31:27,976 --> 00:31:30,843
tell him that you sing
for fun, if you like.

762
00:31:30,845 --> 00:31:32,544
No, I-I was just trying to...
I-I'm-I'm...

763
00:31:32,546 --> 00:31:34,346
I'm gonna go now.
I'll see you later,

764
00:31:34,348 --> 00:31:35,515
but I'll be watching.

765
00:31:35,517 --> 00:31:36,885
- Okay.
- Good luck. See you.

766
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:40,820
- What was that?
- That was so much eye contact.

873
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:59,605
That, my friend, was "Taps"

874
00:36:59,607 --> 00:37:00,906
from the back of the house.

875
00:37:00,908 --> 00:37:02,107
Salute, salute.
We have to salute.

876
00:37:02,109 --> 00:37:03,909
Stand at attention.
This is "Taps."

877
00:37:03,911 --> 00:37:05,978
It's to honor fallen soldiers,

878
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:08,080
and tonight,
it's the fallen Bellas.

879
00:37:08,082 --> 00:37:10,984
Look at this. Those girls
don't even know what to do.

880
00:37:10,986 --> 00:37:12,719
They look like idiots.

This is the best thing
for the movie.

It couldn't be better.

883
00:37:18,926 --> 00:37:20,859
Should we be considering
using instruments?

884
00:37:20,861 --> 00:37:22,395
Is that crazy?

885
00:37:22,397 --> 00:37:24,230
Oh, that's so funny.

886
00:37:24,232 --> 00:37:26,366
You know, I'm gonna pretend
that you didn't just say that

887
00:37:26,368 --> 00:37:27,466
so we can still be friends.

888
00:37:27,468 --> 00:37:30,203
If we had drums,
then we wouldn't need Lilly,

889
00:37:30,205 --> 00:37:31,971
and if we had bass,
then we wouldn't need me.

890
00:37:31,973 --> 00:37:32,839
And we're still not clear

891
00:37:32,841 --> 00:37:34,406
why Jessica and Ashley
are even here.

892
00:37:34,408 --> 00:37:36,141
D-Did they just say our names?

893
00:37:36,143 --> 00:37:37,743
Don't be stupid.

894
00:37:37,745 --> 00:37:39,411
You know what? I have an idea.

895
00:37:39,413 --> 00:37:42,248
We just need to show DJ Khaled
that we are different

896
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:45,417
and better than all
of those other bands, you know?

897
00:37:45,419 --> 00:37:46,819
I think we did great.

898
00:37:46,821 --> 00:37:49,087
I just think the horn
cut our vibe.

899
00:37:49,089 --> 00:37:51,223
True that.

900
00:37:51,225 --> 00:37:52,759
All right, ladies.
Pick up your tits.

901
00:37:52,761 --> 00:37:53,993
We're going out.

902
00:37:53,995 --> 00:37:55,161
What do you mean, "going out"?

903
00:37:55,163 --> 00:37:56,261
What do you mean,
what do I mean?

904
00:37:56,263 --> 00:37:58,897
- We just sucked balls in front of DJ Khaled.
- Hmm?

905
00:37:58,899 --> 00:38:01,234
- Listening.
- He's staying at that fancy

906
00:38:01,236 --> 00:38:02,768
casino hotel
across the street, okay?

907
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:04,303
I say we all get up,
we get dressed,

908
00:38:04,305 --> 00:38:07,373
we go over there, and we show
him that we are not a joke.

909
00:38:07,375 --> 00:38:11,176
Emily, I can't believe

910
00:38:11,178 --> 00:38:14,746
that a half-decent idea
came out of your dumb mouth.

911
00:38:14,748 --> 00:38:16,149
- Thank you.
- Okay?

912
00:38:16,151 --> 00:38:18,183
- So let's get tarted up and...
- Tatted up?

913
00:38:18,185 --> 00:38:21,154
- Tarted. Yeah, yeah, tarted up.
- It sounds like "tatted up."

914
00:38:21,156 --> 00:38:22,989
- She means "tatted."
- She's the caramel tart.

915
00:38:22,991 --> 00:38:25,391
She's a chocolate tart.
You're the vanilla tart.

916
00:38:25,393 --> 00:38:27,192
Thanks, babe.

917

- Oh, "tarted." "Tarted."

919
00:38:32,067 --> 00:38:33,833
If it's easier,
we'll just say "slutty."

920
00:38:33,835 --> 00:38:34,900
- Okay, let's get slutty.
- We'll dress slutty.

Here we go.

- Great idea.
- <i>Patricia,</i>

964
00:40:18,105 --> 00:40:19,906
you know how worried
I've been about you?

965
00:40:19,908 --> 00:40:21,040
You shouldn't have run away.

966
00:40:21,042 --> 00:40:22,574
You should've talked to me.

967
00:40:22,576 --> 00:40:27,145
About what, the C-4 explosives
I found in the cereal box?

968
00:40:27,147 --> 00:40:29,448
Or what about the time
you smuggled drugs

969
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:31,384
in Sir Bounce-a-lot
and I had to see him

970
00:40:31,386 --> 00:40:35,453
get torn apart by custom agents
right in front of me?

971
00:40:35,455 --> 00:40:38,457
Sweetheart,
it was my profession.

972
00:40:38,459 --> 00:40:40,326
What, being dodgy?

973
00:40:40,328 --> 00:40:42,361
Well, that's one word for it.

974
00:40:42,363 --> 00:40:45,598
I mean, yeah, I was a criminal,
but I'm different now.

975
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,033
How'd you even find me?

976
00:40:47,035 --> 00:40:48,167
Well, what do you mean?

977
00:40:48,169 --> 00:40:49,467
I've been in hiding.

978
00:40:49,469 --> 00:40:51,002
Ah, my darling girl,

979
00:40:51,004 --> 00:40:52,938
I've known where
you've been for years.

980
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:56,341
Uh, it's impossible for you
not to stand out in a crowd.

981
00:40:56,343 --> 00:40:58,109
Yeah, why do I have to be
so brilliant

982
00:40:58,111 --> 00:40:59,444
at every single thing I do?

983
00:40:59,446 --> 00:41:01,913
Here, look.
I've always kept this photo

984
00:41:01,915 --> 00:41:04,350
of you and me
close to my heart.

985
00:41:04,352 --> 00:41:07,053
We used to play together.
We used to sing together.

986
00:41:07,055 --> 00:41:08,386

- I was waiting for you.
- I don't... That's weird.

1015
00:42:28,468 --> 00:42:30,303
I saw you hiding
behind the bushes.

1016

No, I don't think so.

1017

jumpsuit

- You know what?

1021

That's embarrassing.

1023

Oh, no, it's, uh,
DJ Khaled's suite.

1024
00:42:41,448 --> 00:42:42,949
- Is it?
- Yeah.

1025
00:42:42,951 --> 00:42:44,449
Oh, I had no idea.

1026
00:42:44,451 --> 00:42:46,152
We're throwing a...
a little party for him,

1027
00:42:46,154 --> 00:42:47,520

1028

You guys should hang out.
You want to hang out?

1029
00:42:49,122 --> 00:42:50,489
- Twist my arm. We'll do it.
- Yeah.

1030
00:42:50,491 --> 00:42:51,656
Well, let's go.
I'll give you a tour.

1031
00:42:51,658 --> 00:42:53,558
- Great. - Yeah.
- All right, come this way.

1032
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:56,594
Uh, Khaled, right now he's, uh,
into this kind of feng shui,

1033
00:42:56,596 --> 00:42:58,698
so he has a specific kind
of arrangement

1034
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,665
to maximize his chi.

1035
00:43:00,667 --> 00:43:04,069
And, oh, Sunburst here
is Khaled's juiceologist.

1036
00:43:04,071 --> 00:43:06,237
Ah, Theo, pardon my zesting.

1037
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:07,406
Would you like a beet juice?

1038
00:43:07,408 --> 00:43:08,708
Your glands look frustrated.

1039
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:10,076
In my country,

1040
00:43:10,078 --> 00:43:11,476
beet juice was reserved
for the king.

1041
00:43:11,478 --> 00:43:13,649
DJ Khaled is the king
of the beats.

1042
00:43:15,616 --> 00:43:18,484
You know, like the...
Beat King, 'cause he's the...

1043
00:43:18,486 --> 00:43:20,486
Oh, honey, that was...
we didn't like that at all.

1044
00:43:20,488 --> 00:43:21,620
It's awful. I know.

1045
00:43:21,622 --> 00:43:25,223
Um, can you explain this,
uh, terrifying situation?

1046
00:43:25,225 --> 00:43:27,359
- What? What, my... the face?
- Not your face.

1047
00:43:27,361 --> 00:43:29,562
- Um, the thing behind you.
- Oh, the apiary.

1048
00:43:29,564 --> 00:43:32,765
- Hmm.
- Oh, right, yeah, no, this is, uh, a portable beehive

1049
00:43:32,767 --> 00:43:35,500
that Sunburst uses
to harvest natural honey.

1050
00:43:35,502 --> 00:43:37,569
Doesn't seem like a disaster
waiting to happen.

1051
00:43:37,571 --> 00:43:38,471
Yes, it can be.

1052
00:43:38,473 --> 00:43:40,573
Oh, Beca,
I got to show you something.

1053
00:43:40,575 --> 00:43:41,741
You're gonna love this.

1054
00:43:41,743 --> 00:43:43,208
Sure.

1055
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:44,509
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1056
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:46,112
- Let's do it.
- I'll bring her right back.

1057
00:43:46,114 --> 00:43:47,112
Oh... yeah, just her.

1058
00:43:47,114 --> 00:43:48,446
Just borrow her for a second.

1059
00:43:48,448 --> 00:43:49,482
Whatever.

1060
00:43:49,484 --> 00:43:52,250
Ooh. Is that an AKG C-24?

1061
00:43:52,252 --> 00:43:54,085
Yes, it certainly is.

1062
00:43:54,087 --> 00:43:55,388
Incredibly rare.

1063
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:57,390
Madonna, Beyoncé, Joan Baez.

1064
00:43:57,392 --> 00:43:59,324
Oh, I'm happy for them.
That's nice.

1065
00:43:59,326 --> 00:44:01,493
Yeah,
the boss likes to be ready

1066
00:44:01,495 --> 00:44:03,462
for whenever inspiration
strikes him,

1067
00:44:03,464 --> 00:44:05,364
- so we have this setup here.
- Sure.

1068
00:44:05,366 --> 00:44:08,134
Yeah, must be good to be
really, really, really rich.

1069
00:44:08,136 --> 00:44:10,335
Yeah.

1070
00:44:10,337 --> 00:44:12,071
You want to give it a go?

1071
00:44:12,073 --> 00:44:13,239
- No.
- No?

1072
00:44:13,241 --> 00:44:15,540
Couldn't possibly.

1073

We're coming to you live.

1075
00:44:18,712 --> 00:44:20,312
- Oh, that's nice.
- Oh, we should've recorded that.

1076
00:44:20,314 --> 00:44:21,513
Oh, she's a beaut.

1077

- Oh, okay. I...

00:45:35,355 --> 00:45:36,721
- Yeah? I'll be right back.
- Do you want me to...

00:45:53,274 --> 00:45:54,873
I knew that song would get you.

1112
00:45:54,875 --> 00:45:56,241
- Whoo-hoo!
- Oh, yeah.

1113
00:45:57,578 --> 00:45:59,444
That's my girl.

1114
00:45:59,446 --> 00:46:01,312
I can't wait.

1115
00:46:01,314 --> 00:46:02,915
We'll travel the world
in my yacht,

1116
00:46:02,917 --> 00:46:06,551
stop at all your favorite
places... the Atlantic Ocean,

1117
00:46:06,553 --> 00:46:08,319
- the Pacific Ocean...
- That would be great!

1118
00:46:08,321 --> 00:46:10,723
But I'm in the middle
of a tour right now.

1119
00:46:10,725 --> 00:46:12,757
But that's perfect.
I'll finally be able

1120
00:46:12,759 --> 00:46:14,726
to see one
of your performances.

1121
00:46:14,728 --> 00:46:17,196
Dad, you've never come
to any of my performances.

1122
00:46:17,198 --> 00:46:20,533
Sweetheart, I've changed.

1123
00:46:20,535 --> 00:46:23,502
It's not the first time
I've heard that.

1124
00:46:23,504 --> 00:46:27,505
But you're still my little
Turnip Top, aren't you?

1125
00:46:27,507 --> 00:46:31,676
I promise I won't
screw it up this time.

1126
00:46:31,678 --> 00:46:33,946
General Posen and I
were wrapping up

1127
00:46:33,948 --> 00:46:35,714
a, uh, clandestine operation.

1128
00:46:35,716 --> 00:46:38,817
In fact, I've just come
from our classified briefing.

1129
00:46:38,819 --> 00:46:41,620
Oh, my God, so you were just
with Aubrey's dad?

1130
00:46:41,622 --> 00:46:43,422
He was so excited
to see your show.

1131
00:46:43,424 --> 00:46:46,361
It's just too bad
that he can't make it.

1132
00:46:47,328 --> 00:46:49,228
- Oh.
- Oh.

1133
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:50,763
Oh, that's okay.

1134
00:46:50,765 --> 00:46:52,698
- Yeah, it's-it's really okay.
- No, that's okay.

1135
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:54,632
- It's totally fine. You know, he's a busy man.
- Uh-huh.

1136
00:46:54,634 --> 00:46:56,634
- That's right.
- And my dad always said,

1137
00:46:56,636 --> 00:46:59,772
"Expect finite disappointment,
and remember,

1138
00:46:59,774 --> 00:47:01,574
there's always more
where that came from."

1139
00:47:01,576 --> 00:47:03,442
Oh, my God, Aubrey!

1140
00:47:15,355 --> 00:47:17,556
Someone open a window!

1141
00:47:17,558 --> 00:47:19,861
- What is wrong with this door?
- I don't know!

1142
00:47:21,861 --> 00:47:24,862
Stand down!

1143
00:47:24,864 --> 00:47:27,333

1146
00:47:38,578 --> 00:47:41,013
Checkmate, Bellas.

1147
00:47:41,015 --> 00:47:43,350
Checkmate.

1148
00:47:49,656 --> 00:47:50,723
Oh, hey.

1149
00:47:50,725 --> 00:47:53,359
Heard you all really, uh,
lit it up last night.

1150
00:47:54,495 --> 00:47:55,893
That's a great joke.

1151
00:47:55,895 --> 00:47:57,629
- It's really funny.
- Like a phoenix

1152
00:47:57,631 --> 00:48:01,333
rising from the ashes,
only a really sad version

1153
00:48:01,335 --> 00:48:03,502
where there's no phoenix
and just ash.

1154
00:48:21,955 --> 00:48:25,056
Sorry, I forgot where we were
in the conversation.

1155
00:48:25,058 --> 00:48:28,661
Next time, when you're trying
to impress DJ Khaled,

1156
00:48:28,663 --> 00:48:30,795
try to have some dignity.

1157
00:48:30,797 --> 00:48:34,799
Uh, we never do anything
with dignity, so...

1158
00:48:34,801 --> 00:48:36,403
Hey, where'd you go last night?

1159
00:48:37,337 --> 00:48:38,670
What, uh, you mean

1160
00:48:38,672 --> 00:48:40,672
when you were burning down
the hotel?

1161
00:48:40,674 --> 00:48:41,940
Dude, where were you?

1162
00:48:41,942 --> 00:48:44,909
Okay. I was with my father,
all right?

1163
00:48:44,911 --> 00:48:46,545
Wait, your dad?

1164
00:48:46,547 --> 00:48:48,346
He's been trying
to track me down for years,

1165
00:48:48,348 --> 00:48:49,547
and last night, he found me.

1166
00:48:49,549 --> 00:48:51,716
Why are you running from him?

1167
00:48:51,718 --> 00:48:53,652
I wish my dad
would pay attention to me.

1168
00:48:53,654 --> 00:48:56,788
Because my dad
wasn't a very nice man.

1169
00:48:56,790 --> 00:48:59,658
So, when I was 18,
I had to run away,

1170
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:02,560
which was a real bitch
because of the chafing.

1171
00:49:02,562 --> 00:49:05,563
And now he has found me,

1172
00:49:05,565 --> 00:49:08,701
and I don't know what to think.

1173
00:49:08,703 --> 00:49:12,504
I mean, I-I think that's
amazing, and so should you.

1174
00:49:12,506 --> 00:49:14,906
I mean, it-it's...
it's a crazy thing.

1175
00:49:14,908 --> 00:49:17,009
He's finally found you
after all these years?

1176
00:49:17,011 --> 00:49:19,377
Now you can rekindle
the relationship,

1177
00:49:19,379 --> 00:49:21,112
and-and it could be
even stronger than it was.

1178
00:49:21,114 --> 00:49:23,082
And maybe he was not
a very nice guy before,

1179
00:49:23,084 --> 00:49:24,982
but maybe he is now,
and maybe he's amazing

1180
00:49:24,984 --> 00:49:27,118
- and wonderful and he wants...
- Okay, Emily, you are so shrill

1181
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,620
- and inarticulate!
- No, no!

1182
00:49:30,091 --> 00:49:31,690
Hello? Oh, it's Stacie.

1183
00:49:31,692 --> 00:49:33,926
Stacie! Stacie's calling me
on FaceTime.

1184
00:49:33,928 --> 00:49:35,661
- You guys! Stop. Get over here.
- What, Stacie?

1185
00:49:35,663 --> 00:49:37,362
- Oh, hello?
- Wait. Right over here.

1186
00:49:37,364 --> 00:49:38,663
- Oh, hi, hi, hi.
- You guys! - Guys!

1187
00:49:38,665 --> 00:49:40,766
- Oh! - Hi.
- Stace!

1188
00:49:40,768 --> 00:49:42,900
- Where are you?
- Stacie, it's going terrible here.

1189
00:49:42,902 --> 00:49:44,603
Yeah, we getting our asses
handed to us.

1190
00:49:44,605 --> 00:49:47,873
Guys, I had the baby.

1191
00:49:49,143 --> 00:49:50,475
- What?
- Aw.

1192
00:49:50,477 --> 00:49:51,542
He's so cute.

1193
00:49:51,544 --> 00:49:53,444
She's a girl.

1194
00:49:53,446 --> 00:49:54,779
Oh, okay, then average.

1195
00:49:54,781 --> 00:49:55,880
What's her name?

1196
00:49:55,882 --> 00:49:57,649
Baby Fat Amy
or Baby Fat Patricia.

1197
00:49:57,651 --> 00:49:59,585
- You can choose.
- No, no, listen.

1198
00:49:59,587 --> 00:50:00,886
I know I've always been
your favorite.

1199
00:50:00,888 --> 00:50:02,891
Guys.

1200
00:50:04,058 --> 00:50:05,656
I named her Bella.

1201
00:50:05,658 --> 00:50:06,991
Aw.

1202
00:50:06,993 --> 00:50:08,627
- See? - That is adorable.
- Oh, that's perfect.

1203
00:50:08,629 --> 00:50:10,129
- That... Okay.
- I love you guys.

1204
00:50:10,131 --> 00:50:12,630
- We love you. We love you so much.
- We miss you.

1205
00:50:12,632 --> 00:50:13,866
You guys.

1206
00:50:13,868 --> 00:50:16,467
She's so cute.

1207
00:50:16,469 --> 00:50:18,469
Guys, can we stop trying
to win this tour

1208
00:50:18,471 --> 00:50:19,904
and just sing together?

1209
00:50:19,906 --> 00:50:22,107
I mean, that's why
we're all here, right?

1210
00:50:22,109 --> 00:50:23,808
Yeah.

1211
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:26,044
But also, let's still try
and win this thing

1212
00:50:26,046 --> 00:50:28,913
because I don't know
how else to live.

Bellas! Make some noise

00:53:04,270 --> 00:53:07,172
What a fitting swan song
for the Barden Bellas.

1277
00:53:07,174 --> 00:53:09,074
Yes, and as these young women
approach 30

1278
00:53:09,076 --> 00:53:11,076
and cease to be of value
as human beings,

1279
00:53:11,078 --> 00:53:13,210
perhaps this
is the bittersweet memory

1280
00:53:13,212 --> 00:53:16,214
they will take
into the bar with them.

1281
00:53:30,029 --> 00:53:32,698
Okay,
welcome to the South of France.

1282
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:35,100
We wanted to do something
kind of special for you guys.

1283
00:53:35,102 --> 00:53:36,835
Wow.

1284
00:53:36,837 --> 00:53:38,703
This feels like a group date
on <i>The Bachelor.</i>

1285
00:53:38,705 --> 00:53:40,705
Oh, it's just so beautiful.

1286
00:53:40,707 --> 00:53:42,774
Yeah, thank you.

1287
00:53:42,776 --> 00:53:44,241
Not free.

1288
00:53:44,243 --> 00:53:45,743
Got it.

1289
00:53:45,745 --> 00:53:47,245
Hey.

1290
00:53:47,247 --> 00:53:52,250
Um, hey, I just wanted to say
thank you for... for this.

1291
00:53:52,252 --> 00:53:55,252
- Oh.
- And for looking out for us on this trip.

1292
00:53:55,254 --> 00:53:59,625
And protecting
the United States... always.

1293
00:53:59,627 --> 00:54:01,259
It's my pleasure.

1294
00:54:01,261 --> 00:54:02,728
Must be kind of lonely,

1295
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:04,228
always being away
from your family,

1296
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:06,263
- being in a different place.
- Yeah.

1297
00:54:06,265 --> 00:54:08,199
But being in the Army
is kind of like

1298
00:54:08,201 --> 00:54:10,002
having a second family,
you know.

1299
00:54:10,004 --> 00:54:12,237
Well, yeah, of course you know.

1300
00:54:12,239 --> 00:54:14,873
I mean, you guys come together
for your tour,

1301
00:54:14,875 --> 00:54:16,408
and when it's over,
you go your separate ways.

1302
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:20,145
But you're always gonna
be there for each other, right?

1303
00:54:20,147 --> 00:54:24,116
I mean, you're never
really alone.

1304
00:54:24,118 --> 00:54:27,152
Wow, that was really cheesy.

1305
00:54:27,154 --> 00:54:28,386
No.

1306
00:54:28,388 --> 00:54:29,856
I liked it.

1307
00:54:35,895 --> 00:54:37,029
You okay?

1308
00:54:37,031 --> 00:54:38,429
Oh, yeah.

1309
00:54:38,431 --> 00:54:41,102
Of course.

1310
00:54:42,102 --> 00:54:43,902
Don't hide your feelings
from me.

1311
00:54:43,904 --> 00:54:45,971
We're like sisters, Aubrey.

1312
00:54:45,973 --> 00:54:49,040
It is "Aubrey," isn't it?

1313
00:54:49,042 --> 00:54:52,143
Mm-hmm.

1314
00:54:52,145 --> 00:54:54,913
Well, to be totally honest,
my dad was supposed to come

1315
00:54:54,915 --> 00:54:56,313
to see us perform tomorrow,

1316
00:54:56,315 --> 00:54:58,116
and I heard
that he can't make it.

1317
00:54:58,118 --> 00:55:00,786
And he's never actually
heard me sing with the Bellas,

1318
00:55:00,788 --> 00:55:03,154
and now maybe
he never will, so...

1319
00:55:03,156 --> 00:55:05,190
Dad? He's here!

1320
00:55:05,192 --> 00:55:06,692
What? Where?

1321
00:55:06,694 --> 00:55:10,161
That's my dad's yacht,
the <i>Fat Dingo Bitch.</i>

1322
00:55:10,163 --> 00:55:12,163
That's what he always
used to call my mum.

1323
00:55:12,165 --> 00:55:14,199
- Oh.
- Obviously, he's come

1324
00:55:14,201 --> 00:55:16,935
to see me perform
in our last ever show!

1325
00:55:16,937 --> 00:55:18,402
My dad came!

1326
00:55:18,404 --> 00:55:20,304
Must feel aca-amazing.

1327
00:55:26,113 --> 00:55:28,145
They gotta be
close to making a decision.

1328
00:55:28,147 --> 00:55:30,214
They film the special
with DJ Khaled tomorrow.

1329
00:55:30,216 --> 00:55:32,216
And he needs an opening act.

1330
00:55:32,218 --> 00:55:35,053
Oh, look who it is.

1331
00:55:35,055 --> 00:55:38,223
Did you guys see the way
they got off stage yesterday?

1332
00:55:38,225 --> 00:55:39,857
They literally went out
of their way

1333
00:55:39,859 --> 00:55:41,225
not to congratulate us.

1334
00:55:41,227 --> 00:55:43,864
They clearly just see us
as a threat.

1335
00:55:45,832 --> 00:55:47,799
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, my God.

1336
00:55:47,801 --> 00:55:49,033
- You are so weird.
- Wow. Sometimes.

1337
00:55:49,035 --> 00:55:51,136
That's not fair.
You seem very nice.

1338
00:55:51,138 --> 00:55:52,804
Can I borrow you for a second?

1339
00:55:52,806 --> 00:55:54,071
- Yeah, great.
- Yeah? Come on.

1340
00:55:54,073 --> 00:55:55,073
- Great.
- You want to hold hands?

1341
00:55:55,075 --> 00:55:56,074
- Nope.
- Cool.

1342
00:55:56,076 --> 00:55:57,174
Where are we going?

1343
00:55:57,176 --> 00:55:59,478
You remember when you
burnt down DJ Khaled's room?

1344
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:00,879
- No, that was not...
- No?

1345
00:56:00,881 --> 00:56:02,047
- I don't remember that.
- Back in Spain?

1346
00:56:02,049 --> 00:56:03,380
- No.
- You were looking for Lenny,

1347
00:56:03,382 --> 00:56:04,982
hiding behind the bushes,
released the bees.

1348
00:56:04,984 --> 00:56:06,384
No, I think that...
that was my sister.

1349
00:56:06,386 --> 00:56:07,451
I hate her. What?

1350
00:56:07,453 --> 00:56:09,054
DJ Khaled wants to meet you.

1351
00:56:09,056 --> 00:56:11,993
- Why?
- Hey, boss.

1352
00:56:12,993 --> 00:56:14,993
Theo, my guy.

1353
00:56:14,995 --> 00:56:16,995
Magical ears.

1354
00:56:16,997 --> 00:56:18,866
- Beca.
- H-Hello.

1355
00:56:20,067 --> 00:56:22,000
- How beautiful.
- Oh, thank you.

1356
00:56:22,002 --> 00:56:23,801
- So nice to meet you.
- ASAP!

1357
00:56:23,803 --> 00:56:25,036
Need a drink for Beca, ASAP!

1358
00:56:25,038 --> 00:56:26,036
Have a seat.

1359
00:56:26,038 --> 00:56:27,239
Make yourself at home.

1360
00:56:27,241 --> 00:56:28,540
Oh, my God.

1361
00:56:28,542 --> 00:56:30,040
- Thank you.
- Just...

1362
00:56:30,042 --> 00:56:31,942
- Yeah.
- Here you go, mademoiselle.

1363
00:56:31,944 --> 00:56:33,210
Thank you.

1364
00:56:33,212 --> 00:56:35,013
I hope you like cherries.

1365
00:56:35,015 --> 00:56:37,149
Beca, have you been talking
to my guy, Theo?

1366
00:56:37,151 --> 00:56:38,350
Yeah, he talks a lot.

1367
00:56:38,352 --> 00:56:40,284
But I have no idea
what's going on.

1368
00:56:40,286 --> 00:56:42,154
He doesn't actually give me
that much information.

1369
00:56:42,156 --> 00:56:43,989
I thought maybe
you could break the news.

1370
00:56:43,991 --> 00:56:45,556
Congratulations.

1371
00:56:45,558 --> 00:56:46,991
On what?

1372
00:56:46,993 --> 00:56:49,361
I want you to open up for me.

1373
00:56:49,363 --> 00:56:50,795
Tomorrow night.

1374
00:56:50,797 --> 00:56:52,496
Beca.

1375
00:56:52,498 --> 00:56:54,565
DJ Khaled.

1376
00:56:54,567 --> 00:56:56,270
Are you ready?

1377
00:56:59,038 --> 00:57:00,908
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

1378
00:57:01,942 --> 00:57:03,275
That is great.

1379
00:57:03,277 --> 00:57:05,844
You are not gonna
regret this. I...

1380
00:57:05,846 --> 00:57:08,913
The Bellas are gonna die.
Can I go tell them?

1381
00:57:08,915 --> 00:57:10,281
I-I think you misunderstood.

1382
00:57:10,283 --> 00:57:12,049
Uh, what DJ Khaled's
trying to say here

1383
00:57:12,051 --> 00:57:14,853
is that he doesn't want
the Bellas.

1384
00:57:14,855 --> 00:57:17,154
We want you.

1385
00:57:17,156 --> 00:57:18,489
- What?
- The other day,

1386
00:57:18,491 --> 00:57:21,158
when you was just
playing around with the loop

1387
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:22,893
and you was singing
and you was just...

1388
00:57:22,895 --> 00:57:26,297
I could tell that you was
just playing around, but...

1389
00:57:26,299 --> 00:57:30,167
I seen something,
I heard something,

1390
00:57:30,169 --> 00:57:32,971
then I felt something.

1391
00:57:32,973 --> 00:57:34,605
Amidst the chaos,
I went back in the room,

1392
00:57:34,607 --> 00:57:36,007
and I pulled your recording.

1393
00:57:36,009 --> 00:57:39,176
Why did you do that?

1394
00:57:39,178 --> 00:57:41,279
Because I wanted to know
what you could do on your own.

1395
00:57:41,281 --> 00:57:44,315
Beca, it's time to go
to the next level.

1396
00:57:44,317 --> 00:57:45,984
I see it.

1397
00:57:45,986 --> 00:57:48,319
I'm DJ Khaled, aka Billy.

1398
00:57:48,321 --> 00:57:51,121
- Who?
- I know these things.

1399
00:57:51,123 --> 00:57:54,458
That is so amazing.

1400
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:56,161
That means the world to me,
honestly.

1401
00:57:56,163 --> 00:57:58,029
But I'm part of a group,

1402
00:57:58,031 --> 00:57:59,496
and we all have
something special.

1403
00:57:59,498 --> 00:58:02,100
I respect
that you love your group,

1404
00:58:02,102 --> 00:58:03,634
but it's time for you
to move on.

1405
00:58:03,636 --> 00:58:05,370
It's time for you to grow.

1406
00:58:05,372 --> 00:58:08,505
It's time for you to climb that
mountaintop and reach the top.

1407
00:58:08,507 --> 00:58:10,408
And the group
will be happy for you.

1408
00:58:10,410 --> 00:58:12,544
What Khaled is trying
to say here is that

1409
00:58:12,546 --> 00:58:15,212
you've really gone as far
as you can with the girls.

1410
00:58:15,214 --> 00:58:17,515
It's time for you
to now flourish on your own.

1411
00:58:17,517 --> 00:58:20,384
Independent... ly.

1412
00:58:20,386 --> 00:58:22,053
These ain't opinions.

1413
00:58:22,055 --> 00:58:23,355
These are facts.

1414
00:58:23,357 --> 00:58:24,890
Yes.

1415
00:58:24,892 --> 00:58:26,424
Come with me a second.

1416
00:58:26,426 --> 00:58:27,658
Bless up.

1417
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:30,027
Listen, I... I know it's a lot

1418
00:58:30,029 --> 00:58:31,362
- to take in, okay?
- Uh, yeah.

1419
00:58:31,364 --> 00:58:32,998
The label is gonna
sign you, Beca.

1420
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,266
The label's gonna sign you.
They're gonna help you

1421
00:58:35,268 --> 00:58:37,669
- develop your own material as a solo act.
- Uh, yeah...

1422
00:58:37,671 --> 00:58:39,471
Th-This is very generous,

1423
00:58:39,473 --> 00:58:41,339
but we're talking
about my family.

1424
00:58:41,341 --> 00:58:43,141
- I'm-I'm... I'm not interested.
- It's...

1425
00:58:43,143 --> 00:58:45,176
- It's a tough decision. I get that.
- No, it's not.

1426
00:58:45,178 --> 00:58:47,545
It is. It is.

1427
00:58:47,547 --> 00:58:50,547
It's a big opportunity for you.
All right?

1428
00:58:50,549 --> 00:58:52,283
Look at me. Stop.

1429
00:58:52,285 --> 00:58:54,287
What are you doing?

1430
00:58:56,156 --> 00:58:57,989
Go home. Sleep on it.

1431
00:58:57,991 --> 00:58:59,357
You come back, and you tell me

1432
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:02,460
what you want to do
in the morning, okay?

1433
00:59:02,462 --> 00:59:04,429
All right?

1434
00:59:04,431 --> 00:59:07,132
I'm... I really am sorry. I...

1435
00:59:32,058 --> 00:59:33,658
Whoo!

1436
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:36,694
Your performance
was incredible, Patricia.

1437
00:59:36,696 --> 00:59:38,529
So proud of you.

1438
00:59:38,531 --> 00:59:40,165
Thanks, Dad.
How did you see it?

1439
00:59:40,167 --> 00:59:41,232
Were you on the base?

1440
00:59:41,234 --> 00:59:43,167
Oh, you know me.
I've got my ways.

1441
00:59:43,169 --> 00:59:45,603
What a note to go out on, eh?

1442
00:59:45,605 --> 00:59:48,272
What do you say
we leave tonight?

1443
00:59:48,274 --> 00:59:51,342
I would, but tomorrow's, like,

1444
00:59:51,344 --> 00:59:53,611
the big televised event
with DJ Khaled,

1445
00:59:53,613 --> 00:59:56,080
and they're definitely gonna
pick the Bellas to perform.

1446
00:59:56,082 --> 00:59:58,516
So I need to be there
'cause my talent compensates

1447
00:59:58,518 --> 01:00:01,219
for the weaker members
of the group, like Beca.

1448
01:00:01,221 --> 01:00:02,520
Tomorrow it is.

1449
01:00:02,522 --> 01:00:05,255
And you can go
wherever you want to go.

1450
01:00:05,257 --> 01:00:06,991
Urban Outfitters?

1451
01:00:08,261 --> 01:00:10,627
You gotta think bigger,
Sunshine.

1452
01:00:10,629 --> 01:00:12,364
A Caribbean tour.

1453
01:00:12,366 --> 01:00:14,199
Have you ever been
to Martinique?

1454
01:00:14,201 --> 01:00:17,634
Or the, uh...
the Cayman Islands?

1455
01:00:17,636 --> 01:00:20,205
- The Cayman Islands?
- Oh, they're beautiful,

1456
01:00:20,207 --> 01:00:22,774
just like my little girl.

1457
01:00:22,776 --> 01:00:24,775
Uh-huh. Right.

1458
01:00:24,777 --> 01:00:26,243
Dad, let me ask you...

1459
01:00:26,245 --> 01:00:27,745
what was your favorite moment
of the show?

1460
01:00:27,747 --> 01:00:30,382
Well, there were too many
moments of greatness

1461
01:00:30,384 --> 01:00:32,183
from which to choose.

1462
01:00:32,185 --> 01:00:34,219
'Cause my favorite part
was the bit

1463
01:00:34,221 --> 01:00:35,520
where I sang that duet
with Beca,

1464
01:00:35,522 --> 01:00:37,422
and then was on the top
of the pyramid.

1465
01:00:37,424 --> 01:00:39,357
Oh, yeah.

1466
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:41,326
Yeah, you were wonderful
in that part.

1467
01:00:41,328 --> 01:00:43,395
God! There was no pyramid!

1468
01:00:43,397 --> 01:00:45,462
And as if I'd be the top.

1469
01:00:45,464 --> 01:00:48,466
And I know exactly
what's in the Cayman Islands.

1470
01:00:48,468 --> 01:00:50,701
Yeah, I do.
That bank account

1471
01:00:50,703 --> 01:00:52,804
that Mum set up for me
on my 13th birthday.

1472
01:00:52,806 --> 01:00:55,707
She said it was just a bit
of an allowance, but...

1473
01:00:55,709 --> 01:00:59,411
I know she didn't want me
to ever need your dirty money.

1474
01:00:59,413 --> 01:01:02,346
How much is even in it anyway?

1475
01:01:02,348 --> 01:01:05,518
$180 million, give or take.

1476
01:01:07,187 --> 01:01:10,687
When am I gonna learn...

1477
01:01:10,689 --> 01:01:12,625
to open my mail?!

1478
01:01:14,828 --> 01:01:16,828
I'm done with you, Dad.

1479
01:01:16,830 --> 01:01:18,797
Forever.

1480
01:01:18,799 --> 01:01:21,498
No, no, you're not.

1481
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:24,301
We are done
when I get the money.

1482
01:01:24,303 --> 01:01:26,404
Amy?

1483
01:01:26,406 --> 01:01:28,339
Is this man bothering you?

1484
01:01:28,341 --> 01:01:30,341
- Yes, he is. Yeah.
- Yeah.

1485
01:01:30,343 --> 01:01:32,743
Sir, step away from the Bella.

1486
01:01:32,745 --> 01:01:36,714
Patricia, all my accounts
are frozen.

1487
01:01:36,716 --> 01:01:39,583
Good-bye, Fergus.

1488
01:01:39,585 --> 01:01:43,353
I tried to do this
the nice way, Patricia.

1489
01:01:43,355 --> 01:01:45,792
You remember that!

1490
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:50,594
So, do you know how to do this?
How do you do this?

1491
01:01:50,596 --> 01:01:52,529
- Pour the water over the sugar, and smash...
- Like this?

1492
01:01:52,531 --> 01:01:53,730
Do you guys know where Beca is?

1493
01:01:53,732 --> 01:01:56,333
Theo must have said
something to her by now.

1494
01:01:56,335 --> 01:01:57,801
The show's literally tomorrow.

1495
01:01:57,803 --> 01:02:00,370
- I know.
- Guys, if Khaled picks us,

1496
01:02:00,372 --> 01:02:02,442
it'll be
our last show together.

1497
01:02:03,609 --> 01:02:05,777
Bellas, a toast.

1498
01:02:05,779 --> 01:02:08,212
- Ah, a Chloe toast.
- They say that...

1499
01:02:08,214 --> 01:02:10,415
home is where the heart is.

1500
01:02:10,417 --> 01:02:15,752
But you guys are the homes
that my heart lives in.

1501
01:02:15,754 --> 01:02:18,491
I am inside of all of you.

1502
01:02:20,292 --> 01:02:21,728
It feels so good.

1503
01:02:22,761 --> 01:02:25,230
- Cheers. - Cheers.
- Salud. - Cheers!

1504
01:02:25,232 --> 01:02:27,431
- Cheers!
- Guys, I love you so much.

1505
01:02:27,433 --> 01:02:29,433
- I feel like...
- Are you hallucinating?

1506
01:02:29,435 --> 01:02:32,337
Excuse me.
Uh, are you the Bellas?

1507
01:02:32,339 --> 01:02:34,239
- Yes.
- <i>Oui, monsieur.</i>

1508
01:02:34,241 --> 01:02:35,672
- <i>Sí.</i>
- My name is Henri.

1509
01:02:35,674 --> 01:02:38,475
Chicago sent me to take you
to the USO reception.

1510
01:02:38,477 --> 01:02:40,210
- Uh...
- Reception? - Huh?

1511
01:02:40,212 --> 01:02:42,480
Chicago never mentioned
any reception.

1512
01:02:42,482 --> 01:02:45,183
Something about
an announcement?

1513
01:02:45,185 --> 01:02:47,685
- Oh. We won. - What?
- Did we win?

1514
01:02:47,687 --> 01:02:49,487
Um, we need
to find our friends,

1515
01:02:49,489 --> 01:02:51,355
- Beca and Fat Amy.
- Great.

1516
01:02:51,357 --> 01:02:54,391
Oh, they are already there
with Chicago.

1517
01:02:54,393 --> 01:02:56,426
- Oh.
- Perfect.

1518
01:02:56,428 --> 01:02:59,297
Let's not keep this
handsome Frenchman waiting.

1519
01:02:59,299 --> 01:03:00,531
- Let's go. Shotgun!
- Ready?

1520
01:03:00,533 --> 01:03:01,732
I guess we should go.
Let's go.

1521
01:03:01,734 --> 01:03:04,301
- Yeah. - Come on.
- Hey, let's go. - Henri?

1522
01:03:04,303 --> 01:03:06,603
- Oh, yeah. Whoo!
- Sounds like music.

1523
01:03:06,605 --> 01:03:09,774
I am Florencia.

The singing sounded very good.

01:03:48,448 --> 01:03:51,549
- Oh, <i>merci beaucoup, Henri.</i>
- Um, are we almost there?

1539
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:53,717
Uh, yes. In fact...

1540
01:03:53,719 --> 01:03:55,819
'Cause it feels like
we've been driving forever.

1541
01:03:55,821 --> 01:03:57,422
...we are right here.

1542
01:03:57,424 --> 01:03:59,223
Yay! Oh, great!

1543
01:03:59,225 --> 01:04:00,725
I don't know.
I can't lift it.

1544
01:04:00,727 --> 01:04:02,527
I can't see.
I can't see anything.

1545
01:04:02,529 --> 01:04:03,962
Why won't the shade go up?
It's, like, stuck.

1546
01:04:03,964 --> 01:04:05,929
- It's so dark out there.
- Can you guys see out yours?

1547
01:04:05,931 --> 01:04:09,600
- No. - No, I can't see.
- Well, this don't seem right.

1548
01:04:09,602 --> 01:04:11,236
Maybe we...

1549
01:04:11,238 --> 01:04:12,370
- Whoa!
- Oh!

1550
01:04:12,372 --> 01:04:14,304
What was that?

1551
01:04:14,306 --> 01:04:16,810
I don't know. What was that?

1552
01:04:18,611 --> 01:04:20,245
What?

1553
01:04:20,247 --> 01:04:23,513
- What happened?
- Huh?

1554
01:04:23,515 --> 01:04:25,315
I don't know.

1555
01:04:25,317 --> 01:04:27,518
Hang on.
You guys, are we...

1556
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:30,288
Are we floating?

1557
01:04:30,290 --> 01:04:32,022
- Why would we be floating?
- What?

1558
01:04:35,828 --> 01:04:37,495
<i>Guys?</i>

1559
01:04:37,497 --> 01:04:38,795
You guys,
I can't open the door.

1560
01:04:38,797 --> 01:04:40,531
What? The door's not opening?

1561
01:04:40,533 --> 01:04:42,966
It's the old van-ferry
death-trap maneuver.

1562
01:04:42,968 --> 01:04:45,303
I should've seen it coming.

1563
01:04:45,305 --> 01:04:46,536
- Oh, God.
- What?

1564
01:04:46,538 --> 01:04:48,906
- Open it. Open the door.
- Help!

1565
01:04:48,908 --> 01:04:50,040
Does... does anybody's
cell phone work?

1566
01:04:50,042 --> 01:04:51,042
Where's my cell phone?

1567
01:04:51,044 --> 01:04:52,342
No service.

1568
01:04:52,344 --> 01:04:53,777
No service. There's nothing.

1569
01:04:53,779 --> 01:04:56,480
- That's so inconvenient.
- Hell's bells!

1570
01:04:56,482 --> 01:04:57,815
We could scream
on the count of three.

1571
01:04:57,817 --> 01:04:59,850
- Okay. One, two, three.
- One, two, three!

1572
01:04:59,852 --> 01:05:01,387
Help!

1573
01:05:09,495 --> 01:05:11,864
Sir Bounce-a-lot.

1574
01:05:29,649 --> 01:05:32,417
- I told you we're through!
- I know.

1575
01:05:32,419 --> 01:05:34,752
But there are some people here

1576
01:05:34,754 --> 01:05:37,587
who think you should
reconsider.

1577
01:05:37,589 --> 01:05:40,991
Amy!

1578
01:05:43,629 --> 01:05:44,929
How could you?

1579
01:05:44,931 --> 01:05:47,832
I swear to God,
if you hurt any one of them,

1580
01:05:47,834 --> 01:05:50,935
except for Jessica and Ashley,
I will kill you!

1581
01:05:50,937 --> 01:05:52,904
I don't want to hurt anyone,
Patricia.

1582
01:05:52,906 --> 01:05:55,873
The only one I wanted was you,
but you weren't with them,

1583
01:05:55,875 --> 01:05:57,442
were you?

1584
01:05:57,444 --> 01:05:59,109
Oh, well.

1585
01:05:59,111 --> 01:06:01,078
Plan B.

1586
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:03,348
You have 30 minutes.

1587
01:06:03,350 --> 01:06:04,815
Come to the boat,

1588
01:06:04,817 --> 01:06:07,518
or your friends
swim with the fishies.

1589
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:09,987
And I think you know I mean it.

1590
01:06:09,989 --> 01:06:11,823
Oh, I know you mean it.

1591
01:06:11,825 --> 01:06:13,690
Because you're
a terrible person

1592
01:06:13,692 --> 01:06:15,960
that does terrible things.

1593
01:06:15,962 --> 01:06:18,562
But there's one thing
you're forgetting, Dad.

1594
01:06:18,564 --> 01:06:19,931
I'm your daughter.

1595
01:06:19,933 --> 01:06:23,433
Your nightmare blood,
it runs through my veins!

1596
01:06:23,435 --> 01:06:25,136
Hey, Amy, um, I need to talk
to you about something.

1597
01:06:25,138 --> 01:06:27,739
- It's kind of important.
- Oh, yeah, just a sec.

1598
01:06:27,741 --> 01:06:29,373
- I'm on a call.
- Okay.

1599
01:06:29,375 --> 01:06:30,607
You think you're bad?

1600
01:06:30,609 --> 01:06:33,944
You have no idea
what I'm capable of.

1601
01:06:33,946 --> 01:06:36,013
I've graduated college.

1602
01:06:36,015 --> 01:06:37,714
I could do anything.

1603
01:06:37,716 --> 01:06:40,051
So say your prayers,

1604
01:06:40,053 --> 01:06:43,054
'cause Fat Amy is coming...

1605
01:06:43,056 --> 01:06:45,922
for you.

1606
01:06:45,924 --> 01:06:47,658
Now!

1607
01:06:50,629 --> 01:06:53,063
So...

1608
01:06:53,065 --> 01:06:55,600
which two of you

1609
01:06:55,602 --> 01:06:57,837
are Ashley and Jessica?

1610
01:06:59,439 --> 01:07:01,772
- Ah, shit.
- <i>Okay, so...</i>

1611
01:07:01,774 --> 01:07:02,841
I have kind of bad news.

1612
01:07:02,843 --> 01:07:05,109
Uh, and I know you're
gonna be fine. Uh, I know

1613
01:07:05,111 --> 01:07:06,980
- every-everybody's gonna be fine, but, like...
- Uh-huh.

1614
01:07:08,848 --> 01:07:10,181
Oh.

1615
01:07:10,183 --> 01:07:13,049
- Um, w-well...
- Yep.

1616
01:07:13,051 --> 01:07:15,051
We didn't get picked, man.
And you know what?

1617
01:07:15,053 --> 01:07:17,788
Like, screw them. It's not,
like, the whole story.

1618
01:07:17,790 --> 01:07:20,792
There's... uh, uh, uh...

1619
01:07:20,794 --> 01:07:22,794
I don't know, I still feel
like I want to tell you

1620
01:07:22,796 --> 01:07:23,661
'cause I think that, like,

1621
01:07:23,663 --> 01:07:25,629
secrets are, like,
the worst, right?

1622
01:07:25,631 --> 01:07:26,797
So...

1623
01:07:26,799 --> 01:07:28,665
Yeah, it's the worst.

1624
01:07:28,667 --> 01:07:30,067
Let's go.

1625
01:07:30,069 --> 01:07:31,536
Go where?

1626
01:07:31,538 --> 01:07:33,940
Don't worry.
We'll change in the cab.

1627
01:07:39,212 --> 01:07:40,745
Amy, what are we doing?

1628
01:07:40,747 --> 01:07:43,080
Why are we not calling
the police or Chicago?

1629
01:07:43,082 --> 01:07:45,049
No cops. There's no time.

1630
01:07:45,051 --> 01:07:47,585
And if my dad sees 'em,
he'll take off.

1631
01:07:47,587 --> 01:07:48,786
This is serious.

1632
01:07:48,788 --> 01:07:50,554
The Bellas
could really get hurt.

1633
01:07:50,556 --> 01:07:52,522
- Not on my watch.
- Amy, come on.

1634
01:07:52,524 --> 01:07:54,091
Look, I know my father.

1635
01:07:54,093 --> 01:07:55,692
I know his guys.

1636
01:07:55,694 --> 01:07:57,828
Some of them I know,
like, really well.

1637
01:07:57,830 --> 01:08:00,198
And I know that boat.

1638
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:02,098
We can do this.

1639
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:04,067
Okay. What's the plan?

1640
01:08:04,069 --> 01:08:06,937
First up, I need you
to pick up the pace.

1641
01:08:06,939 --> 01:08:08,841
This boat's not gonna
row itself.

1642
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:15,980
Okay. That's the ladder
that'll take you

1643
01:08:15,982 --> 01:08:17,815
up to the main deck
where the Bellas are.

1644
01:08:17,817 --> 01:08:19,749
Do not let Fergus
hear what I'm doing below.

1645
01:08:19,751 --> 01:08:21,752
Okay, giant distraction
coming up.

1646
01:08:21,754 --> 01:08:24,187
- You sure about this?
- Have I ever let you down?

1647
01:08:24,189 --> 01:08:27,057
Dozens of examples
spring to mind, if I'm honest.

1648
01:08:27,059 --> 01:08:29,093
- What?
- Yeah, you're very unreliable.

1649
01:08:29,095 --> 01:08:31,094
It's, like, one of the
hallmarks of your personality.

1650
01:08:31,096 --> 01:08:33,698
I don't think we have time
to unpack that right now.

1651
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:35,999
Shh. I'll just see you up top.

1652
01:08:36,001 --> 01:08:37,634
Nobody's gonna die tonight,
right?

1653
01:08:37,636 --> 01:08:38,936
- Yeah.
- Right?

1654
01:08:38,938 --> 01:08:40,871
- Yeah.
- Well, that doesn't help.

1655
01:08:40,873 --> 01:08:42,507
- Okay.
- Okay, ready?

1656
01:08:42,509 --> 01:08:43,941
I've got my serious face
on now.

1657
01:08:43,943 --> 01:08:45,743
- Okay.
- It's time.

1658
01:08:45,745 --> 01:08:47,878
Let's do it.

1659
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:51,516
Once we get the money,
we sail directly to Sydney.

1660
01:08:51,518 --> 01:08:53,750
Unless she doesn't show.

1661
01:08:53,752 --> 01:08:56,553
Then things get ugly.

1662
01:08:56,555 --> 01:08:58,155
Ten minutes, ladies.

1663
01:08:58,157 --> 01:09:00,627
Guys, you know
what we should do?

1664
01:09:01,827 --> 01:09:03,160
Where did you come from?

1665
01:09:03,162 --> 01:09:04,294
What?

1666
01:09:04,296 --> 01:09:05,629
You weren't here before.

1667
01:09:05,631 --> 01:09:07,632
I've been here the whole time.

1668
01:09:07,634 --> 01:09:10,069
I'm just small.

1669
01:09:15,675 --> 01:09:19,744
Just... if we only have
ten minutes left,

1670
01:09:19,746 --> 01:09:22,914
I say we spend it
doing something we love.

1671
01:09:22,916 --> 01:09:27,187
Let's go out like Bellas and...
and sing one more song.

1672
01:09:29,188 --> 01:09:31,989
You want to sing right now?

1673
01:09:31,991 --> 01:09:34,191
I think we should sing
one more song, though.

1674
01:09:34,193 --> 01:09:36,192
I don't know if I feel like singing.

1675
01:09:36,194 --> 01:09:39,899
Oh, my God. Guys, I just want
to sing so bad.

1676
01:09:41,634 --> 01:09:43,034
We really think you'll like it.

1677
01:09:43,036 --> 01:09:45,002
You want to entertain me?

1678
01:09:45,004 --> 01:09:47,070
Knock yourselves out.

1679
01:09:47,072 --> 01:09:48,806
Nine minutes.

1680
01:09:48,808 --> 01:09:50,807
Let's make it a loud one, guys.

1681
01:09:50,809 --> 01:09:52,709
You are terrible
at reading signals.

1682
01:09:52,711 --> 01:09:54,848

You really shouldn't

01:12:17,223 --> 01:12:19,292
Let's dance.

1713
01:12:34,107 --> 01:12:36,339

01:13:12,245 --> 01:13:15,012
Nipple cripple!

1718
01:13:15,014 --> 01:13:17,047
Nipple cripple!

1719
01:13:17,049 --> 01:13:19,019
Take it.

1720
01:13:23,121 --> 01:13:25,959

Amy, come on! Amy!

1732
01:14:31,489 --> 01:14:33,492
Sweet baby Jesus!

1733
01:14:36,996 --> 01:14:38,561
Amy, let's go!

1734
01:14:43,536 --> 01:14:46,536
- Amy, come on!
- Patricia!

1735
01:14:46,538 --> 01:14:48,375
Stop her!

1736
01:14:59,385 --> 01:15:01,485
- Beca! Beca!
- Amy!

1737
01:15:01,487 --> 01:15:05,021
Hey, you've been a very
naughty girl, Turnip Top!

1738
01:15:05,023 --> 01:15:06,423
Amy! Amy!

1739
01:15:06,425 --> 01:15:08,258
Amy!

1740
01:15:13,632 --> 01:15:18,002
I rained hellfire!

1741
01:15:32,417 --> 01:15:33,984
The MPs arrested Amy's dad.

1742
01:15:33,986 --> 01:15:35,418
He's going to jail
for a long time.

1743
01:15:35,420 --> 01:15:37,087
I'm gonna go meet them,
all right?

1744
01:15:37,089 --> 01:15:38,524
- Okay.
- Sit tight.

1745
01:15:39,591 --> 01:15:41,424
I have no idea
what just happened,

1746
01:15:41,426 --> 01:15:43,960
but if Khaled doesn't pick us
after all of that,

1747
01:15:43,962 --> 01:15:45,495
what are we doing
with our lives?

1748
01:15:45,497 --> 01:15:47,998
- Right? - I know.
- Mm-hmm. - Seriously.

1749
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,299
Uh, I think Beca has something

1750
01:15:49,301 --> 01:15:51,438
she'd like to share
with the group.

1751
01:15:52,505 --> 01:15:54,405
Um, thanks, Amy.

1752
01:15:54,407 --> 01:15:55,606
Uh, yeah.

1753
01:15:55,608 --> 01:15:59,176
I was gonna say something
earlier, but we were involved

1754
01:15:59,178 --> 01:16:01,210
in a hostage crisis,
so I just...

1755
01:16:01,212 --> 01:16:02,448
They picked her.

1756
01:16:03,581 --> 01:16:05,449
DJ Khaled and his team.

1757
01:16:05,451 --> 01:16:06,717
They didn't pick the Bellas.

1758
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:08,584
They picked Beca.

1759
01:16:08,586 --> 01:16:10,654
So they... yeah,
so they only picked her.

1760
01:16:10,656 --> 01:16:13,990
Yeah, but I said no because
I feel exactly how you feel.

1761
01:16:13,992 --> 01:16:17,026
You guys are family, and you
don't walk away from family.

1762
01:16:17,028 --> 01:16:18,728
Don't you want to make music?

1763
01:16:18,730 --> 01:16:20,297
No, I guess, but...

1764
01:16:20,299 --> 01:16:22,967
Beca, you can't say no.
You've gotta do it.

1765
01:16:22,969 --> 01:16:25,268
Look, your real family
doesn't hold you back.

1766
01:16:25,270 --> 01:16:27,206
They lift you up.

1767
01:16:28,741 --> 01:16:31,240
Kind of feel like I've been
saying something to that effect

1768
01:16:31,242 --> 01:16:32,575
- the entire time.
- Oh, my God, Emily!

1769
01:16:32,577 --> 01:16:35,478
Smart people
are talking right now.

1770
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:37,580
Aubrey, don't, please.

1771
01:16:37,582 --> 01:16:39,583
It's... I-I won't do it.
It's not important.

1772
01:16:39,585 --> 01:16:40,784
No, no, no.
It's-it's not that.

1773
01:16:40,786 --> 01:16:43,721
You know, I have
to be honest with you guys.

1774
01:16:43,723 --> 01:16:47,324
Every time I perform
in front of people,

1775
01:16:47,326 --> 01:16:49,493
I feel like I'm gonna puke.

1776
01:16:49,495 --> 01:16:51,762
And I don't have to anymore.

1777
01:16:51,764 --> 01:16:54,630
I'm so happy.

1778
01:16:54,632 --> 01:16:56,767
- Aw.
- Yes!

1779
01:16:56,769 --> 01:16:58,502
- No more puking.
- Whew!

1780
01:16:58,504 --> 01:17:00,270
- No more puke.
- No more puke.

1781
01:17:00,272 --> 01:17:01,538
Yes.

1782
01:17:01,540 --> 01:17:03,640
You know what?
I think I might just...

1783
01:17:03,642 --> 01:17:07,578
I don't know, move to Mykonos
and become a doula.

1784
01:17:07,580 --> 01:17:10,114
- A doula?
- A birthing coach.

1785
01:17:10,116 --> 01:17:12,149
- You gonna coach babies?
- Mm-hmm.

1786
01:17:12,151 --> 01:17:13,653
Yeah, I'll be like...

1787
01:17:15,086 --> 01:17:17,087
"Come here, little guy.
You can do it.

1788
01:17:17,089 --> 01:17:18,554
"There ain't really
nothing to it.

1789
01:17:18,556 --> 01:17:20,723
You can do it,
you can do it. Come on!"

1790
01:17:20,725 --> 01:17:22,493
- Ah...
- Now that gay people

1791
01:17:22,495 --> 01:17:25,294
can serve in the military,
I'm-a join the Air Force

1792
01:17:25,296 --> 01:17:27,364
and let them pay
for my flight school.

1793
01:17:27,366 --> 01:17:31,334
I have my Abnormal Psych exam
coming up next week.

1794
01:17:31,336 --> 01:17:33,603
But also, you're gonna
keep writing

1795
01:17:33,605 --> 01:17:37,207
so your life isn't filled
with crushing regret, right?

1796
01:17:37,209 --> 01:17:39,109
- Yes.
- Good.

1797
01:17:39,111 --> 01:17:40,543
Well, guys, a music career

1798
01:17:40,545 --> 01:17:42,612
would interfere
with my business, so...

1799
01:17:42,614 --> 01:17:45,783
Yeah, that little tiny
juice truck you work at.

1800
01:17:45,785 --> 01:17:47,183
The juice truck I own

1801
01:17:47,185 --> 01:17:49,419
and just secured capital
to franchise.

1802
01:17:49,421 --> 01:17:51,454
- So... - Uh, what?
- Oh! - Cool.

1803
01:17:51,456 --> 01:17:54,591
- I didn't tell you guys?
- Congratulations.

1804
01:17:54,593 --> 01:17:56,162
Cool beans.

1805
01:17:57,162 --> 01:17:58,561
You talk?

1806
01:17:59,564 --> 01:18:02,165
Satan has finally left my body.

1807
01:18:02,167 --> 01:18:05,502
Hi. I'm Esther.

1808
01:18:05,504 --> 01:18:08,172
- Wha...?
- I have many questions.

1809
01:18:08,174 --> 01:18:11,208
You guys?

1810
01:18:11,210 --> 01:18:13,477
I think it's time that we go on

1811
01:18:13,479 --> 01:18:15,579
with the next chapter
of our lives.

1812
01:18:15,581 --> 01:18:19,415
It's time for us to move on.
You know?

1813
01:18:19,417 --> 01:18:21,752
I mean, we're always gonna
be there for each other

1814
01:18:21,754 --> 01:18:23,654
because we're family.

1815
01:18:23,656 --> 01:18:26,323
And, I mean, I, for one,
am very ready.

1816
01:18:26,325 --> 01:18:28,592
I got the call that I got
into vet school.

1817
01:18:28,594 --> 01:18:30,694
- You got in!
- Yes, I got in. I know.

1818
01:18:30,696 --> 01:18:33,664
- No way! - Oh!
- I got in. I'm a vet.

1819
01:18:33,666 --> 01:18:35,699
Congratulations!

1820
01:18:35,701 --> 01:18:37,366
What about you, Ames?

1821
01:18:37,368 --> 01:18:39,168
You sure you're cool with this?

1822
01:18:39,170 --> 01:18:40,303
Are you kidding me?

1823
01:18:40,305 --> 01:18:42,539
I just found out
I got $180 million

1824
01:18:42,541 --> 01:18:44,740
to put into
"Fat Amy Winehouse."

1825
01:18:44,742 --> 01:18:45,609
- What?
- Yeah.

1826
01:18:45,611 --> 01:18:49,480
- Whoa.
- Wait, I could do more shows.

1827
01:18:49,482 --> 01:18:52,615
"Fat Amy Adams."
"Fat Amy Grant."

1828
01:18:52,617 --> 01:18:54,351
Oh, that would be good
for Christmas.

1829
01:18:54,353 --> 01:18:55,451
Would be great.

1830
01:18:55,453 --> 01:18:58,288
- Beca.
- Don't.

1831
01:18:58,290 --> 01:19:00,390
I swear to God,
don't make that face.

1832
01:19:00,392 --> 01:19:03,459
If you cry, I'm gonna cry.
I swear.

1833
01:19:03,461 --> 01:19:05,228
I'm not gonna do this
with you today, so...

1834
01:19:05,230 --> 01:19:06,496
- I'm not doing it.
- I hate that face.

1835
01:19:06,498 --> 01:19:08,265
- I'm not.
- Don't make that face.

1836
01:19:08,267 --> 01:19:09,833
- Don't.
- This is my regular face.

1837
01:19:09,835 --> 01:19:11,301
You know how much I love you.

1838
01:19:11,303 --> 01:19:14,670
You just get out there,
and you crush it.

1839
01:19:14,672 --> 01:19:15,739
Okay?

1840
01:19:15,741 --> 01:19:17,508
You crush it so hard

1841
01:19:17,510 --> 01:19:20,410
that your nips tingle a bit.

1842
01:19:20,412 --> 01:19:21,611
- She loves hugs.
- Don't. - Bring it in.

1843
01:19:21,613 --> 01:19:22,913
- That's not funny.
- We should give her one.

1844
01:19:22,915 --> 01:19:26,783
- I... - Yay!

of the USO Tour
in the South of France,

1855

coming to you
from the Citadel.

1856

What a gorgeous setting
here tonight under the stars.

1857

Isn't this beautiful?
Doing a wonderful

1858
01:19:57,315 --> 01:19:59,415
musical presentation
in a bunker.

1859
01:19:59,417 --> 01:20:00,651
In the South of France.

1860
01:20:00,653 --> 01:20:02,451
I mean, it's so romantic here.

1861
01:20:02,453 --> 01:20:03,920
I've never been to France.

1862
01:20:03,922 --> 01:20:05,422
I hope never to come back.

1863
01:20:05,424 --> 01:20:06,823
Oh, no, it's not
a place for you.

1864
01:20:06,825 --> 01:20:08,792
Oh, no, no.
There's no good people here.

1865
01:20:08,794 --> 01:20:09,825
No, no.

1866
01:20:09,827 --> 01:20:10,960
On your toes, folks.

1867
01:20:10,962 --> 01:20:13,366
We're on in ten.
First positions.

1868
01:20:18,770 --> 01:20:20,570
Ladies and gentlemen,

1869
01:20:20,572 --> 01:20:24,740
let's give it up for DJ Khaled!

1870
01:20:28,279 --> 01:20:31,315
When I say "fan,"
you say "love."

1871
01:20:31,317 --> 01:20:32,415
Fan!

1872
01:20:32,417 --> 01:20:33,784
- Love!
- Fan!

1873
01:20:33,786 --> 01:20:34,485
Love!

1874
01:20:34,487 --> 01:20:36,320
First of all, I want to thank

1875
01:20:36,322 --> 01:20:38,321
all the troops
for coming out here.

1876
01:20:38,323 --> 01:20:39,856
It's about you.

1877
01:20:39,858 --> 01:20:41,290
We salute you.

1878
01:20:41,292 --> 01:20:43,459
We praise you and thank you.

1879
01:20:43,461 --> 01:20:45,829
But tonight I have a surprise.

1880
01:20:45,831 --> 01:20:50,334
I'll be introducing you
to a new star.

1881
01:20:50,336 --> 01:20:51,567
A superstar.

1882
01:20:51,569 --> 01:20:54,637
Somebody that I have cosigned.

1883
01:20:54,639 --> 01:20:57,274
I introduce you to...

1884
01:20:57,276 --> 01:20:59,409
Beca Mitchell.

1885
01:21:02,014 --> 01:21:05,515
And here's Beca Mitchell
stepping onto the stage,

1886
01:21:05,517 --> 01:21:07,918
just as small as she was
the day she was born.

1887
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:10,686
You know, we've been following
this little sprite-light lady

1888
01:21:10,688 --> 01:21:13,022
for, I don't know,
seven years now, I think.

1889
01:21:13,024 --> 01:21:14,758
We have been showing you

1890
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:16,927
her new life
out in the real world,

1891
01:21:16,929 --> 01:21:19,562
where she's out to take
another perfectly good job

1892
01:21:19,564 --> 01:21:20,899
from an able-bodied man.

1893
