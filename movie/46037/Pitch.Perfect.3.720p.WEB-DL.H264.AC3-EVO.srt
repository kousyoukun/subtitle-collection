The winningest a cappella group

The Barden Bellas,
an unlikely group of not-men

at something

00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,260
to get a real singer.
I have a couple thoughts.

00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:32,049

love it if you could trust me.

I would love it if you leave
my track how it is.

I made your song great, man.

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,749
I think what she means is,

75
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,089
your song was always great.

76
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:41,950
No, what I mean
is what you gave me

77
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,459
- was a steaming pile of...
- Pimp-Lo!

78
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,259
Okay. There's something
that you should know.

00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,929
Uh, Beca...

80
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,959
- is on her period.
- Wow.

81
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,229
- Oh, it's shark week? Hot damn.
- Bum-bum.

82
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,730

That's my moms right there.

83
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,670
- You know what it is.
- Mm-hmm.

84
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,900
- Still menstruating? Hmm.
- Okay. - Truth.

85
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:01,870
If you could just
excuse us for a second.

86
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,939
What are you doing?

87
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,339
How can you take his side?

88
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,979
Sides? Well, we...

89
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,409
Why are we always talking
about sides?

90
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,310
Okay, it's our job, brah.

91
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,419
We're producers.

92
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:13,389
We bring his vision to life.

93
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:16,350

Hey!

95
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,859
I did it.

96
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,499
I finally quit my job.

97
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,869
And I'm free, I'm free.
I'm never going back

98
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,469
to that job again.

99
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:32,139
It's the best day of my life.
I mean, I can't be

100
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,400
a music producer
without integrity.

101
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:34,939
What's up?

102
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,070
What?

103
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,509
Wait. S-Something's wrong.

104
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:40,009
Your face is more pinched
than normal.

105
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:41,379
I-I finally did it.

106
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,510
You got back together
with Jesse?

107
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,419
No! You know the long-distance
thing didn't work.

108
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:49,889
He lives 3,000 miles away
with his girlfriend

109
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:51,259
- and their cat.
- Oh.

110
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,359
He got over you much quicker
than what I thought.

111
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,059
- Oh, thank you, Amy.
- Much faster than Bumper,

112
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,360
who is rightfully
still devastated.

113
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:01,199
You know he got a tattoo
of me on his butt cheek?

114
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,269
So now, every time he wants
to see me, he's like...

115
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,369
He's just...

116
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,269
- Okay. Um...
- That made me dizzy.

117
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:11,009
- Wait, what's up?
- I quit my job.

118
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:13,239
- You got fired?
- Oh, come on.

119
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,509
All right.
I-I didn't get fired.

120
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,579
- I quit.
- Come here.

121
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,379
You're kind of making it worse.

122
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,380
Let this negative energy
be released!

123
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:21,549
Seriously, open your legs.
It'll come out quicker.

124
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:23,219
- No, no.
- It'll come out quicker,

125
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,159
- the bad energy.
- Why do you do this stuff?

126
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,459
- Okay, seriously.
- Why are you like this?

127
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,859
- You're gonna come back from this so fast.
- Mm.

128
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:32,329
You know why? Because you have
an amazing best friend.

129
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:33,499
Is that you?

130
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,599
Yeah.

131
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,069
- Okay.
- And also...

132
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,339
You need to pay the rent.

133
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,900
Just a little.

134
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:41,969
Uh, every month,
we have to do it. Ugh.

135
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:43,039
Right.

136
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,070
Yeah.

137
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,479
You could get a job, you know.

138
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,609
Beca, you're in shock.

139
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,340
You need something to eat.

140
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,379
- Yeah. Just sit down.
- Oh.

141
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,849
Not these, though.
They're mine.

142
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,180
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Chloe!

143
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,349
Why aren't you guys ready?

144
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,350
Why are you wearing that?

145
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,159
- What?
- Did you wear that to work?

146
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,429
- Yeah, underneath my scrubs.
- Well, sweetie, why?

147
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,390
Because it reminds me
I was special once.

148
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,429
But also because tonight
is, you... you know...

149
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:14,139
the Bellas reunion
at the Brooklyn Aquarium.

150
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,569
- Hello!
- That's tonight?

151
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:17,209
- Aw, yeah!
- You know what?

152
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:18,270
I will take it.
I need a distraction anyway.

153
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,409
- Yeah. Yes, you do! Whoo!
- I love it. Here we go!

154
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,240
What happened?

155
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,649
- She got fired today.
- No.

156
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,150
- Hey, Stacie.
- Oh, my God!

157
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,489
- Finally!
- Aw. Good to see you.

158
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,120
What's up, pitches?

159
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:41,660
- I know, I know.
- Hi, Beca. - Oh!

160
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,560
I missed you guys so much.

161
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:44,399
I can't wait for us
to sing together.

162
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,100
I'm so excited.

163
00:07:45,101 --> 00:07:46,530
Hey, ladies.

164
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,100
Let's crush this.

165
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,339
- Hi. - Hello.
- Stacie!

166
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,170
Hi!

167
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:52,639
Hey, Bellas.

168
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,979
- Hi!
- Hi!

169
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,640
Thank you so much
for inviting us.

170
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:58,179
- Of course.
- So, what do you want us to sing tonight?

171
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,510
A little "Who Run the World,"
some "Bulletproof"?

172
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,249
You didn't tell us
what the crowd was,

173
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,680
- but I, um...
- What's she talking about?

174
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,389
I brought this, just in case.

175
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,619
- Oh, God.
- Our voices are warm.

176
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:13,299
Um, we didn't
invite you guys to sing.

177
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,359
We invited you to...

178
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,469
- watch us sing.
- Watch.

179
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,699
Aca-scuse me?

180
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,169
I just thought you guys
were so busy with your...

your awesome jobs
and amazing lives.

Thanks.

You guys, I am so sorry.

263
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,899
I realize I should not have
used the word "reunion."

264
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,609
I should have said that it was
an excuse to see each other.

265
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:49,870
I really didn't think that out.

- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no.

You guys were so great.

268
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,839
And this was
a really nice chance

269
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,909
for us to get together.

270
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,149
Right, ladies?

271
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,479
- Yeah, sure.
- Oh, yes.

272
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,249
Oh, yes, really great.

273
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,549
- So great.
- Thank you so much.

274
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:04,489
I was supposed to go
to my brother's wedding,

275
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,919
- but this is nice, too.
- Aw.

276
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,889
- Yeah.
- Bellas, a toast.

277
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:11,159
- There!
- Toast! Yay!

278
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,529
To the most amazing

279
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:15,329
group of women
I have ever known.

280
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:17,369
I would do anything

281
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,930
to sing with you guys again.

282
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,799
Anything!

283
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,309
I mean, really,
I could just crap myself!

284
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,339
- Oh.
- Uh-uh.

285
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:28,540
Cheers.

286
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,549
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I'm having a crazy idea.

287
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,610
Okay, I've mentioned
that my dad is in the Army

288
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,519
and, like, basically killed
Osama bin Laden, right?

289
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,549
Some new information
in that sentence, but okay.

290
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,689
Well, what I mean is, he's
kind of a big deal in the Army.

291
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:41,359
And every year, the USO
puts on this performance

292
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,859
to entertain
and support the troops.

293
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,759
And this year,
DJ Khaled is hosting.

294
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,399
He's got, like,
a gazillion hit songs,

295
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,229
and he's super famous.

296
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:51,529
I saw him on a tax commercial.

297
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,769
What if I could get us
an invite?

298
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:55,439
To sing?

299
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,839
No, to run military dark ops.

300
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,439
Yes, of course, to sing.

301
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,509
Is there a competition?

302
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,709
There should always be
a competition.

303
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:07,879
Oh, um...
well, well, no, but...

304
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,980
let's sing together again.

305
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,419
And... and maybe
I'll see my dad.

306
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,559
Or maybe I won't,
you know, because he has

307
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,320
something really important
to do.

308
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,989
Or maybe I'll be
the most important thing

309
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:20,229
in his life this time.

310
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,330
Maybe.

311
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,369
- Who's with me?
- Me. Mm-hmm.

312
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:29,999
Yeah. I suddenly have a lot
of free time, so hell yeah.

313
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,339
Well, I just got
kicked out of flight school

314
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,009
for killing 300 fake people.

315
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:36,940
- I hate fake people.
- I hate a fake bitch.

316
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:39,810
Can you fly when
you're eight months pregnant?

317
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,619
- What?
- No.

318
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,480
Um...

319
00:13:42,481 --> 00:13:44,480
- Look.
- Oh...

320
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,249
That's...
that's eight months pregnant?

321
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,750
You guys didn't notice?

322
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,259
- Well, congratulations.
- Oh, my God.

323
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,689
Ah!

324
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:53,759
- I mean, I'm so happy for you.
- Amazing! - Wow.

325
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,399
Do you know who the father is?

326
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,499
Eh.

327
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,760
- Oh. - Oh.
- Congratulations.

328
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,699
Happy accidents.

329
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,330
Okay, well, Stacie's out.

330
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,900
So I guess, Emily, you're in.

331
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,039
- Oh, yeah. I'm in for sure.
- Yeah!

332
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,779
Yay.

333
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:11,640
- Was I not always in?
- Um...

334
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,009
- Oh, no, no, no. Of course.
- Yes.

335
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:14,049
Oh, cool. I... Okay.

336
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:16,649
Cheers!

Hola, señoritas.

346
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:48,949
Where'd you guys even come from?

347
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,619
A little town called
Persistence, sweet cheeks.

348
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,819
That's right.
Here, here's the thing.

349
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,389
Look at this, ladies.

350
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,689
All-access passes.

351
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:56,919
We're tall enough
for all the rides.

352
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,759
You can run,
but you cannot hide.

353
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,559
This d'aca'mentary is happening!

354
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,890
We're gonna film
this whole thing.

355
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:03,760
It's gonna be beautiful.

356
00:15:03,761 --> 00:15:05,059
We're making a beautiful
d'aca'mentary.

357
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,429
In fact, we gotta set up.

358
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:07,499
Where are we gonna set up, John?

359
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,500
I want to give you the...

360
00:15:08,501 --> 00:15:10,530

Welcome to Spain, Bellas.

366
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,589
A few important things
to note before we begin.

367
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,750
Grab your luggage.

368
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,820
All right, thank you.

369
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,959
You always want
to stay 25 feet...

370
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,999
...choke.

371
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,399
...very sharp. We do not
want you to impale yourself.

372
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,939
I hope you all heard
each and every word,

373
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:52,010
or else you might
very well end up dead.

374
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:55,609
Ladies, I'm messing with you.

375
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:57,849
On behalf of the Department
of Defense, we would like

376
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:00,149
to welcome you to
Naval Air Station Rota, Spain.

377
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:02,619
And a sincere thank-you
for coming out to entertain

378
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,850
our troops and their families.

379
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,489
We're excited for this tour.

380
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:07,089
My name's Chicago.
Over here to my left

381
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:09,529
is Captain Bernie,
who we like to call Zeke.

382
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,959
- Ladies.
- We're gonna be with you the whole tour

383
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,829
- as your escorts and security details.
- Question.

384
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,870
Will we all be
showering together?

385
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,909
Uh, first up is a sound check.

386
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:25,070
We'll have you back
to the hotel by 1430.

387
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,639
Maybe hit the rain locker,

388
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,509
back here for the big show
at 1700. Yeah.

389
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:32,920
1700... is that,
like, later than the night?

390
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,049
It's 5:00.

391
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,580
Okay. Whatever.

392
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,889
- Okay... Yep.
- Question, question.

393
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:40,920
Um, so this is the first base.

394
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:43,800
Will we be going to second base
with you guys?

395
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,759
And then,
maybe a few days later,

396
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,729
we'll go to third base?

397
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:51,830
That's a "no" for me, so...

398
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,169
Wait, what's after
the third base?

399
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:55,139
Why don't we get you
to your first venue?

400
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,639
Come on.

401
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,809
All right, well, we are

402
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,039
really excited to have you here.

403
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,679
Right now we're in Hangar Three.

404
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,709
This is where we keep
all of our helicopters.

405
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:05,579
Of course, now we've got
the big stage

406
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,079
built up for the tour.

407
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,880
So, on the tour,
we've got three bands.

408
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,789
Over here, we got Saddle Up.

409
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:14,559
This is Young Sparrow
and DJ Dragon Nutz.

410
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,689
And behind me is Evermoist.

411
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:18,159
Oh!

412
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,559
And check it out.
DJ Khaled just rolled in.

413
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,759
Let's set the stage,
all right?

414
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,829
- Let's get ready before the...
- So we should turn around

415
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:24,799
- and shoot into it, I think.
- ...the Bellas out.

416
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,800
- Get the Bellas...
- Hey, guys.

417
00:17:25,801 --> 00:17:26,969
Come say hey to the new group.

418
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,569
- Yo. - Hi.
- Oh.

419
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:31,000
Hello. We're the Bellas,

420
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:34,039
formerly of Barden University
and currently of life.

421
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,940
- Ladies.
- Howdy.

422
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,149
- Hey. - Hey.
- Ladies, I want

423
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,549
to give you
a little forewarning.

424
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:40,010
My man's social anxiety,

425
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,119
when he's not behind the
turntables, it's kind of crazy.

426
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,989
- So be easy, all right?
- Hello. - Hi.

427
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,619
♪ Hello ♪

428
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:50,659
♪ Is it me you're looking for? ♪

429
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,789
Right on. I'm Calamity.

430
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:55,190
This is Serenity,
Veracity and Charity.

431
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,160
- Hi. - Hey.
- Hi.

432
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:59,199
If I joined your group,
I could be Obesity.

433
00:18:00,171 --> 00:18:02,239
- Get it?
- Oh, if you're wondering,

434
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,200
- our presence here has nothing to do with...
- Nothing.

435
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,539
...the nationally televised
"Salute to the Troops" special

436
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:09,579
where DJ Khaled is going to
pick one group to open for him

437
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,740
at the end of this tour.

438
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,849
That was a lot of exposition.

439
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:15,019
So there is a competition.

440
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,519
I knew it.

441
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,949
- And so there is.
- Idiots!

442
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,019
What, do you think we

443
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,619
care about just watching
you guys?

444
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,159
It's a competition! Hello!

445
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,589
You guys just sing
other people's songs, right?

446
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,890
- Like a cover band.
- No, no, no, no.

447
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,029
- No.
- Uh, no, no, no. Uh, well,

448
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:32,099
actually, Emily writes
original songs for the Bellas.

449
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,769
I mean, I don't really
do it anymore.

450
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:35,269
- I kind of did that one, and then I...
- Hey.

451
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:37,269
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
You with us or against us?

452
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:39,769
And it was one of your dads
who gave you

453
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:41,309
the spot on the tour, right?

454
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,309
- Oh, my God.
- Um...

455
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,280
- Ooh...
- Guys, stop.

456
00:18:44,281 --> 00:18:45,779
They just don't like
sharing the spotlight,

457
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,849
so they're trying
to intimidate us.

458
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:49,019
Let's just take the high road
and do what we do.

459
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,280
You thinking what I'm thinking?

460
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:50,920
What are you thinking?

461
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,920
A riff-off.

462
00:18:51,921 --> 00:18:54,789
- That's not what I was thinking.
- A riff-off!

463
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:57,120
Wait. Yes.
A riff-off! Yes!

464
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:58,920
- What is a riff-off?
- Yeah.

465
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,259
A riff-off is a little game

466
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,799
that we like to play
to see who's better.

467
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,760
- Mm-hmm.
- We start with a topic. Um...

468
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,669
- Let's say "party songs."

wrinkles the soul."

623
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,310
Hmm.

624
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:06,239
- Three...
- How about those Bulls?

625
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,609
Gotta love those Cubs.

626
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:12,549
And the deep dish pizza,
'cause it's so...

627
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:14,090
deep.

628
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,719
Chicago.

629
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,019
Right?

630
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,650
Yeah, I'm actually from Georgia.

631
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,719
Oh.

632
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,120
So, what's your story?

633
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:23,259
Why are you here?

634
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,059
Oh, boy. Um...

635
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,129
Long story short,
I was in the NG,

636
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:30,269
but my CO recommended me
for OCS after, uh, AIT.

637
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:33,099
Then came OBC
and RTB where I, uh,

638
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,069
was the, uh, DG of my class.

639
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:37,469
It's... I don't know.

640
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,239
Sorry. Um...

641
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,009
I joined the National Guard.

642
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:42,509
They helped put me
through college.

643
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:45,379
I spent about
a year stationed in Kabul.

644
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:48,479
Uh, actually overseeing
a canine unit over there.

645
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,049
We trained German shepherds,

646
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:51,750
we trained pit bulls...

647
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,619
Dogs.

648
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,719
I love dogs.

649
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,420
I love animals, in general.

650
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:59,029
- Animals are cute.
- You're cute. I mean, what?

651
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:01,090
- What about you?
- Me? Me.

652
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,260
Uh, shorter story...

653
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:04,629
I was in a singing group
in college,

654
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:09,369
and then now I am still
in that same singing group,

655
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:11,409
but not in college.

656
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:12,669
- But you're committed.
- I am committed.

657
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:14,139
- That's great.
- Yeah, I love commitment

658
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,479
- and being committed.
- Yeah.

659
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,409
- Not to, like, an asylum. Whoa.
- Right.

660
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:18,810
Or, like, a hospital, like,
it's... I'm not saying...

661
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,549
- Yeah, no, I know.
- But, like... just, I like...

662
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:22,549
I love love.
I love being committed to love.

663
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:25,389
Not to you, but to, like...
I love, um, like, oranges.

664
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:26,619
- Oranges.
- I love...

665
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,759
Hey. Uh, girls?

666
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,420
- Hmm?
- We have separate rooms. We don't have to

667
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:31,559
sleep on top
of each other anymore.

668
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,689
- What?
- Hey, that's great.

669
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:35,259
Um, not sexually.

670
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,730
There was that one time.

671
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:50,440
Stop being so loud.

672
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:52,249
- Yeah. No, yeah.
- Oh, that's what I want.

673
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,479
Uh, no, that's the molasses one.

674
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,179
No, you're not gonna
like that one.

675
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,449
- This one.
- I don't want molasses.

676
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:58,380
Okay, you guys,
so we've never

677
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:00,349
competed against bands
that play actual instruments.

678
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,489
What's the plan?

679
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:04,389
I really think we should just
stay true to ourselves,

680
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:06,590
- and it will all figure itself out.
- Emily?

681
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,199
- Mm-hmm.
- Please hear this in the best way possible.

682
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,859
You're a very stupid person.

683
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,860
You know what?
Maybe it won't matter

684
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:15,430
if we win or not, because
they will like us so much

685
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,399
that they will invite us
to keep touring with them.

686
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,269
And it won't matter
if I get into vet school

687
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:20,869
because we will be together
as a family,

688
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:22,479
supporting each other.

689
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,310
And really, isn't that
what it's all about?

690
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,310
- Yes.
- Yes.

691
00:28:26,311 --> 00:28:27,849
Yeah, except for all families
break apart,

692
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:31,820
and the only person you can
ever truly rely on is yourself.

693
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:36,350
All right, time to drop a smash.

694
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,489
- What? - Oh, no, no, no.
- Whoo! - Wait.

695
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:41,730
- Think it's a whole album.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Uh, hola. Um...

721
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:17,450
- Uh, excusez-moi.
- Bonjour. Ciao.

722
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,859
- No hablo...
- Inglese? Konnichiwa?

723
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,589
- The...
- Sa-na-ma-na-ma?

724
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:23,459
You're English. Hi.

725
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,859
That's right. I saw you do
the, uh, sound check,

726
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:29,329
- um, thing that you guys...
- Yeah. The riff-off thing.

727
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:30,569
- Riff-off.
- Yeah. I don't know why we

728
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:31,799
keep challenging people
to those.

729
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,339
We... we don't ever
actually win.

730
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:35,339
- Oh.
- Do you work for the USO?

731
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,409
Uh, no, I-I work for DJ Khaled.

732
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:38,939
Sorry. I'm-I'm Theo.

733
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:39,740
- Hi. I'm Beca.
- Hi.

734
00:30:39,741 --> 00:30:41,940
- Nice to meet you.
- How you doing?

735
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:42,740
Sorry, you are a...

736
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,379
- Oh, I'm a...
- Music executive?

737
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,479
...music exec
at Khaled's label.

738
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,719
- Really?
- Yeah.

739
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,480
- What?
- No, I-I... I work

740
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:49,889
with music executives,
and you...

741
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,850
they... they don't look
like you.

742
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,019
Oh.

743
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,689
What... what do I look like?

744
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:56,590
A turtle.

745
00:30:56,591 --> 00:31:00,029
Well, that's in...
incredibly specific.

746
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,960
But, like, you literally
look just like that.

747
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:03,399
No, no. It's accurate.

748
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,630
You said you work
with music execs.

749
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,899
Oh. Yeah. Um, no, I'm a...

750
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,439
I'm a music producer.

751
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,009
I'm sort of freelancing
right now.

752
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:12,670
Oh, and I sing for fun.

753
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,279
I'm interested to see
the Bellas in action.

754
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,649
Yeah, maybe we'll even open
for DJ Khaled in the end.

755
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:20,679
You don't think
you'll open for Khaled?

756
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,919
Uh, no, I-I...
I didn't say that.

757
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,389
Yeah, you did. You did.
You just said it before.

758
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:26,659
You kind of implied it,
if anything.

759
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,989
- Well, I just...
- I could just

760
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:30,859
tell him that you sing
for fun, if you like.

761
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,559
No, I-I was just trying to...
I-I'm-I'm...

762
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,359
I'm gonna go now.
I'll see you later,

763
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,529
but I'll be watching.

764
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:36,900
- Okay.
- Good luck. See you.

765
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:40,839
- What was that?
- That was so much eye contact.

Who came up with that name?

779
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,379
My bum crack's a bit dry.

780
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,119
Does anyone have
an Evermoist towelette?

781
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:34,489

Oh, wow!

So, put your hands together
for the Bellas.

818
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:46,119
The Bellas reunited
finally onstage.

819
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,680
They're gonna rock these troops
with their mouth music.

820

And, as predicted, Gail,

Tough blow. What was that?

872
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:59,609
That, my friend, was "Taps"

873
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:00,910
from the back of the house.

874
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,110
Salute, salute.
We have to salute.

875
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,919
Stand at attention.
This is "Taps."

876
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,989
It's to honor fallen soldiers,

877
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:08,089
and tonight,
it's the fallen Bellas.

878
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:10,989
Look at this. Those girls
don't even know what to do.

879
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:12,729
They look like idiots.

880
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,129
This is the best thing
for the movie.

881
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:16,230
It couldn't be better.

882
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:20,869
Should we be considering
using instruments?

883
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:22,399
Is that crazy?

884
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,239
Oh, that's so funny.

885
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,370
You know, I'm gonna pretend
that you didn't just say that

886
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,470
so we can still be friends.

887
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:30,209
If we had drums,
then we wouldn't need Lilly,

888
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:31,979
and if we had bass,
then we wouldn't need me.

889
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:32,850
And we're still not clear

890
00:37:32,851 --> 00:37:34,410
why Jessica and Ashley
are even here.

891
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,149
D-Did they just say our names?

892
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:37,749
Don't be stupid.

893
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,419
You know what? I have an idea.

894
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:42,259
We just need to show DJ Khaled
that we are different

895
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,420
and better than all
of those other bands, you know?

896
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,829
I think we did great.

897
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:49,090
I just think the horn
cut our vibe.

898
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,229
True that.

899
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:52,769
All right, ladies.
Pick up your tits.

900
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:53,999
We're going out.

901
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,169
What do you mean, "going out"?

902
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:56,269
What do you mean,
what do I mean?

903
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:58,900
- We just sucked balls in front of DJ Khaled.
- Hmm?

904
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:01,239
- Listening.
- He's staying at that fancy

905
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,770
casino hotel
across the street, okay?

906
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,309
I say we all get up,
we get dressed,

907
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:07,379
we go over there, and we show
him that we are not a joke.

908
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:11,179
Emily, I can't believe

909
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:14,749
that a half-decent idea
came out of your dumb mouth.

910
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,159
- Thank you.
- Okay?

911
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,189
- So let's get tarted up and...
- Tatted up?

912
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:21,159
- Tarted. Yeah, yeah, tarted up.
- It sounds like "tatted up."

913
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,999
- She means "tatted."
- She's the caramel tart.

914
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,399
She's a chocolate tart.
You're the vanilla tart.

915
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,199
Thanks, babe.

916
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,199
Mm...

917
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,069
- Oh, "tarted."
- Oh, "tarted." "Tarted."

918
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:33,839
If it's easier,
we'll just say "slutty."

919
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,909
- Okay, let's get slutty.
- We'll dress slutty.

Why are we hiding?

What are you guys doing?

Nothing.

Ain't that Mr. Eye Contact?

He knows Khaled, right?

We should follow him.

Okay, legacy, come on.

961
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:16,169
You guys, act normal, casual.
Here we go.

962
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:18,109
- Great idea.
- Patricia,

963
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:19,909
you know how worried
I've been about you?

964
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:21,040
You shouldn't have run away.

965
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:22,579
You should've talked to me.

966
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:27,149
About what, the C-4 explosives
I found in the cereal box?

967
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:29,449
Or what about the time
you smuggled drugs

968
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:31,389
in Sir Bounce-a-lot
and I had to see him

969
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:35,459
get torn apart by custom agents
right in front of me?

970
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:38,459
Sweetheart,
it was my profession.

971
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:40,329
What, being dodgy?

972
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:42,360
Well, that's one word for it.

973
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:45,599
I mean, yeah, I was a criminal,
but I'm different now.

974
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,039
How'd you even find me?

975
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,169
Well, what do you mean?

976
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:49,469
I've been in hiding.

977
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:51,000
Ah, my darling girl,

978
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:52,939
I've known where
you've been for years.

979
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:56,340
Uh, it's impossible for you
not to stand out in a crowd.

980
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:58,109
Yeah, why do I have to be
so brilliant

981
00:40:58,110 --> 00:40:59,449
at every single thing I do?

982
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:01,919
Here, look.
I've always kept this photo

983
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,349
of you and me close to my heart.

984
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:07,059
We used to play together.
We used to sing together.

985
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,389
We used to be a team.

986
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:10,459

- I was waiting for you.
- I don't... That's weird.

1014
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:30,300
I saw you hiding
behind the bushes.

1015
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:31,439
No, I don't think so.

1016
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,209
This is a really popular
jumpsuit

and hairstyle, so that wasn't...

- You know what?

1019

I see what's happened.

1020
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:38,579
This is not my friend
Lenny's suite.

1021
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:40,109
That's embarrassing.

1022
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:41,449
Oh, no, it's, uh,
DJ Khaled's suite.

1023
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:42,949
- Is it? -
- Yeah.

1024
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:44,449
Oh, I had no idea.

1025
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:46,149
We're throwing a...
a little party for him,

1026
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:47,519
if he decides to show.

1027
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,119
You guys should hang out.
You want to hang out?

1028
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,489
- Twist my arm. We'll do it.
- Yeah.

1029
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:51,659
Well, let's go.
I'll give you a tour.

1030
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:53,559
- Great. - Yeah.
- All right, come this way.

1031
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:56,590
Uh, Khaled, right now he's, uh,
into this kind of feng shui,

1032
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,699
so he has a specific kind
of arrangement

1033
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,660
to maximize his chi.

1034
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:04,069
And, oh, Sunburst here
is Khaled's juiceologist.

1035
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:06,239
Ah, Theo, pardon my zesting.

1036
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,409
Would you like a beet juice?

1037
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:08,709
Your glands look frustrated.

1038
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:10,079
In my country,

1039
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,479
beet juice was reserved
for the king.

1040
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,650
DJ Khaled is the king
of the beats.

1041
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:18,480
You know, like the...
Beat King, 'cause he's the...

1042
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:20,489
Oh, honey, that was...
we didn't like that at all.

1043
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:21,619
It's awful. I know.

1044
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:25,219
Um, can you explain this,
uh, terrifying situation?

1045
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:27,359
- What? What, my... the face?
- Not your face.

1046
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,559
- Um, the thing behind you.
- Oh, the apiary.

1047
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:32,760
- Hmm.
- Oh, right, yeah, no, this is, uh, a portable beehive

1048
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:35,499
that Sunburst uses
to harvest natural honey.

1049
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,569
Doesn't seem like a disaster
waiting to happen.

1050
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:38,470
Yes, it can be.

1051
00:43:38,471 --> 00:43:40,569
Oh, Beca,
I got to show you something.

1052
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:41,739
You're gonna love this.

1053
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:43,209
Sure.

1054
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:44,509
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1055
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:46,109
- Let's do it.
- I'll bring her right back.

1056
00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:47,110
Oh... yeah, just her.

1057
00:43:47,111 --> 00:43:48,440
Just borrow her for a second.

1058
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:49,479
Whatever.

1059
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:52,249
Ooh. Is that an AKG C-24?

1060
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:54,080
Yes, it certainly is.

1061
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:55,389
Incredibly rare.

1062
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:57,389
Madonna, Beyoncé, Joan Baez.

1063
00:43:57,390 --> 00:43:59,319
Oh, I'm happy for them.
That's nice.

1064
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,489
Yeah,
the boss likes to be ready

1065
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:03,459
for whenever inspiration
strikes him,

1066
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:05,359
- so we have this setup here.
- Sure.

1067
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:08,129
Yeah, must be good to be
really, really, really rich.

1068
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:10,330
Yeah.

1069
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:12,069
You want to give it a go?

1070
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:13,239
- No.
- No?

1071
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,539
Couldn't possibly.

1072
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:17,470
Ooh.

1073
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:18,709
We're coming to you live.

1074
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:20,309
- Oh, that's nice.
- Oh, we should've recorded that.

1075
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:21,509
Oh, she's a beaut.

1076
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:23,279
- What's this?
- Oh, this is just...

1077

- Yeah? I'll be right back.
- Do you want me to...

00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:39,619

00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:54,869
I knew that song would get you.

1111
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:56,239
- Whoo-hoo!
- Oh, yeah.

1112
00:45:57,570 --> 00:45:59,439
That's my girl.

1113
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,309
I can't wait.

1114
00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:02,909
We'll travel the world
in my yacht,

1115
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:06,549
stop at all your favorite
places... the Atlantic Ocean,

1116
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:08,310
- the Pacific Ocean...
- That would be great!

1117
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,719
But I'm in the middle
of a tour right now.

1118
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,749
But that's perfect.
I'll finally be able

1119
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:14,719
to see one of your performances.

1120
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,189
Dad, you've never come
to any of my performances.

1121
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:20,529
Sweetheart, I've changed.

1122
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:23,499
It's not the first time
I've heard that.

1123
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:27,499
But you're still my little
Turnip Top, aren't you?

1124
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:31,669
I promise I won't
screw it up this time.

1125
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:33,939
General Posen and I
were wrapping up

1126
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:35,709
a, uh, clandestine operation.

1127
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:38,809
In fact, I've just come
from our classified briefing.

1128
00:46:38,810 --> 00:46:41,610
Oh, my God, so you were just
with Aubrey's dad?

1129
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:43,419
He was so excited
to see your show.

1130
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:46,360
It's just too bad
that he can't make it.

1131
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:49,219
- Oh.
- Oh.

1132
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:50,759
Oh, that's okay.

1133
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,689
- Yeah, it's-it's really okay.
- No, that's okay.

1134
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:54,629
- It's totally fine. You know, he's a busy man.
- Uh-huh.

1135
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:56,629
- That's right.
- And my dad always said,

1136
00:46:56,630 --> 00:46:59,769
"Expect finite disappointment,
and remember,

1137
00:46:59,770 --> 00:47:01,569
there's always more
where that came from."

1138
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:03,439
Oh, my God, Aubrey!

1139
00:47:15,350 --> 00:47:17,549
Someone open a window!

1140
00:47:17,550 --> 00:47:19,850
- What is wrong with this door?
- I don't know!

1141
00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:24,859
Stand down!

1142
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:27,329

1145
00:47:38,570 --> 00:47:41,009
Checkmate, Bellas.

1146
00:47:41,010 --> 00:47:43,340
Checkmate.

1147
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:50,719
Oh, hey.

1148
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,349
Heard you all really, uh,
lit it up last night.

1149
00:47:54,490 --> 00:47:55,889
That's a great joke.

1150
00:47:55,890 --> 00:47:57,619
- It's really funny.
- Like a phoenix

1151
00:47:57,620 --> 00:48:01,329
rising from the ashes,
only a really sad version

1152
00:48:01,330 --> 00:48:03,490
where there's no phoenix
and just ash.

1153
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:25,049
Sorry, I forgot where we were
in the conversation.

1154
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:28,650
Next time, when you're trying
to impress DJ Khaled,

1155
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:30,789
try to have some dignity.

1156
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:34,789
Uh, we never do anything
with dignity, so...

1157
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:36,400
Hey, where'd you go last night?

1158
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:38,659
What, uh, you mean

1159
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:40,660
when you were burning down
the hotel?

1160
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:41,929
Dude, where were you?

1161
00:48:41,930 --> 00:48:44,899
Okay. I was with my father,
all right?

1162
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:46,539
Wait, your dad?

1163
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:48,339
He's been trying
to track me down for years,

1164
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:49,539
and last night, he found me.

1165
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:51,709
Why are you running from him?

1166
00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:53,640
I wish my dad
would pay attention to me.

1167
00:48:53,650 --> 00:48:56,779
Because my dad
wasn't a very nice man.

1168
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:59,649
So, when I was 18,
I had to run away,

1169
00:48:59,650 --> 00:49:02,549
which was a real bitch
because of the chafing.

1170
00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:05,550
And now he has found me,

1171
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:08,689
and I don't know what to think.

1172
00:49:08,690 --> 00:49:12,499
I mean, I-I think that's
amazing, and so should you.

1173
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:14,899
I mean, it-it's...
it's a crazy thing.

1174
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:16,999
He's finally found you
after all these years?

1175
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,369
Now you can rekindle
the relationship,

1176
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:21,100
and-and it could be
even stronger than it was.

1177
00:49:21,110 --> 00:49:23,070
And maybe he was not
a very nice guy before,

1178
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:24,970
but maybe he is now,
and maybe he's amazing

1179
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:27,109
- and wonderful and he wants...
- Okay, Emily, you are so shrill

1180
00:49:27,110 --> 00:49:28,609
- and inarticulate!
- No, no!

1181
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:31,679
Hello? Oh, it's Stacie.

1182
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,919
Stacie! Stacie's calling me
on FaceTime.

1183
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,649
- You guys! Stop. Get over here.
- What, Stacie?

1184
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:37,349
- Oh, hello?
- Wait. Right over here.

1185
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:38,650
- Oh, hi, hi, hi.
- You guys! - Guys!

1186
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:40,759
- Oh! - Hi.
- Stace!

1187
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:42,889
- Where are you?
- Stacie, it's going terrible here.

1188
00:49:42,890 --> 00:49:44,590
Yeah, we getting our asses
handed to us.

1189
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:47,860
Guys, I had the baby.

1190
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:50,469
- What?
- Aw.

1191
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:51,529
He's so cute.

1192
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,430
She's a girl.

1193
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,769
Oh, okay, then average.

1194
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:55,869
What's her name?

1195
00:49:55,870 --> 00:49:57,639
Baby Fat Amy
or Baby Fat Patricia.

1196
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,579
- You can choose.
- No, no, listen.

1197
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:00,879
I know I've always been
your favorite.

1198
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,880
Guys.

1199
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:05,649
I named her Bella.

1200
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:06,979
Aw.

1201
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:08,619
- See? - That is adorable.
- Oh, that's perfect.

1202
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:10,119
- That... Okay.
- I love you guys.

1203
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:12,619
- We love you. We love you so much.
- We miss you.

1204
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:13,859
You guys.

1205
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:16,459
She's so cute.

1206
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:18,459
Guys, can we stop trying
to win this tour

1207
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:19,890
and just sing together?

1208
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:22,099
I mean, that's why
we're all here, right?

1209
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:23,799
Yeah.

1210
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:26,030
But also, let's still try
and win this thing

1211
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,899
because I don't know
how else to live.

1212
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:31,409
Ciao, Bellas.

1213
00:50:31,410 --> 00:50:32,709
Who wants to go to Italy?

1214
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:34,439
Four countries in four days.

1215
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,179
- One, two...
- And then DJ Khaled will announce

1216
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:38,910
the winner when we arrive
in France. Let's do this!

Bellas! Make some noise

1275
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:07,159
What a fitting swan song
for the Barden Bellas.

1276
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:09,059
Yes, and as these young women
approach 30

1277
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:11,059
and cease to be of value
as human beings,

1278
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:13,199
perhaps this
is the bittersweet memory

1279
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:16,199
they will take
into the bar with them.

1280
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:32,680
Okay,
welcome to the South of France.

1281
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:35,089
We wanted to do something
kind of special for you guys.

1282
00:53:35,090 --> 00:53:36,819
Wow.

1283
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:38,689
This feels like a group date
on The Bachelor.

1284
00:53:38,690 --> 00:53:40,689
Oh, it's just so beautiful.

1285
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:42,759
Yeah, thank you.

1286
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:44,229
Not free.

1287
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:45,729
Got it.

1288
00:53:45,730 --> 00:53:47,229
Hey.

1289
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:52,239
Um, hey, I just wanted to say
thank you for... for this.

1290
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:55,239
- Oh.
- And for looking out for us on this trip.

1291
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:59,609
And protecting
the United States... always.

1292
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:01,240
It's my pleasure.

1293
00:54:01,250 --> 00:54:02,709
Must be kind of lonely,

1294
00:54:02,710 --> 00:54:04,209
always being away
from your family,

1295
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:06,249
- being in a different place.
- Yeah.

1296
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:08,180
But being in the Army
is kind of like

1297
00:54:08,190 --> 00:54:09,989
having a second family,
you know.

1298
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:12,219
Well, yeah, of course you know.

1299
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:14,859
I mean, you guys come together
for your tour,

1300
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:16,389
and when it's over,
you go your separate ways.

1301
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:20,129
But you're always gonna
be there for each other, right?

1302
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:24,099
I mean, you're never
really alone.

1303
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:27,139
Wow, that was really cheesy.

1304
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:28,369
No.

1305
00:54:28,370 --> 00:54:29,840
I liked it.

1306
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,010
You okay?

1307
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:38,410
Oh, yeah.

1308
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:41,090
Of course.

1309
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:43,889
Don't hide your feelings
from me.

1310
00:54:43,890 --> 00:54:45,950
We're like sisters, Aubrey.

1311
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:49,020
It is "Aubrey," isn't it?

1312
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:52,129
Mm-hmm.

1313
00:54:52,130 --> 00:54:54,899
Well, to be totally honest,
my dad was supposed to come

1314
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:56,299
to see us perform tomorrow,

1315
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:58,099
and I heard
that he can't make it.

1316
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:00,769
And he's never actually
heard me sing with the Bellas,

1317
00:55:00,770 --> 00:55:03,139
and now maybe
he never will, so...

1318
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:05,170
Dad? He's here!

1319
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:06,679
What? Where?

1320
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:10,140
That's my dad's yacht,
the Fat Dingo Bitch.

1321
00:55:10,150 --> 00:55:12,149
That's what he always
used to call my mum.

1322
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:14,179
- Oh.
- Obviously, he's come

1323
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:16,919
to see me perform
in our last ever show!

1324
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:18,389
My dad came!

1325
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:20,289
Must feel aca-amazing.

1326
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:28,129
They gotta be
close to making a decision.

1327
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:30,199
They film the special
with DJ Khaled tomorrow.

1328
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:32,199
And he needs an opening act.

1329
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:35,039
Oh, look who it is.

1330
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:38,209
Did you guys see the way
they got off stage yesterday?

1331
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:39,839
They literally went out
of their way

1332
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,209
not to congratulate us.

1333
00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:43,850
They clearly just see us
as a threat.

1334
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:47,779
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, my God.

1335
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:49,019
- You are so weird.
- Wow. Sometimes.

1336
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:51,119
That's not fair.
You seem very nice.

1337
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:52,789
Can I borrow you for a second?

1338
00:55:52,790 --> 00:55:54,050
- Yeah, great.
- Yeah? Come on.

1339
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:55,060
- Great.
- You want to hold hands?

1340
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:56,060
- Nope.
- Cool.

1341
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:57,159
Where are we going?

1342
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:59,459
You remember when you
burnt down DJ Khaled's room?

1343
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:00,859
- No, that was not...
- No?

1344
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:02,029
- I don't remember that.
- Back in Spain?

1345
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:03,359
- No.
- You were looking for Lenny,

1346
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,960
hiding behind the bushes,
released the bees.

1347
00:56:04,970 --> 00:56:06,369
No, I think that...
that was my sister.

1348
00:56:06,370 --> 00:56:07,429
I hate her. What?

1349
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:09,039
DJ Khaled wants to meet you.

1350
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:11,970
- Why?
- Hey, boss.

1351
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:14,970
Theo, my guy.

1352
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:16,979
Magical ears.

1353
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:18,850
- Beca.
- H-Hello.

1354
00:56:20,050 --> 00:56:21,979
- How beautiful.
- Oh, thank you.

1355
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:23,779
- So nice to meet you.
- ASAP!

1356
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:25,019
Need a drink for Beca, ASAP!

1357
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:26,020
Have a seat.

1358
00:56:26,021 --> 00:56:27,219
Make yourself at home.

1359
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:28,519
Oh, my God.

1360
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:30,019
- Thank you.
- Just...

1361
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:31,920
- Yeah.
- Here you go, mademoiselle.

1362
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:33,189
Thank you.

1363
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:34,990
I hope you like cherries.

1364
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,129
Beca, have you been talking
to my guy, Theo?

1365
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:38,329
Yeah, he talks a lot.

1366
00:56:38,330 --> 00:56:40,269
But I have no idea
what's going on.

1367
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:42,139
He doesn't actually give me
that much information.

1368
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:43,969
I thought maybe
you could break the news.

1369
00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:45,539
Congratulations.

1370
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:46,969
On what?

1371
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:49,339
I want you to open up for me.

1372
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:50,779
Tomorrow night.

1373
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:52,479
Beca.

1374
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,549
DJ Khaled.

1375
00:56:54,550 --> 00:56:56,250
Are you ready?

1376
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:00,890
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

1377
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,259
That is great.

1378
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:05,820
You are not gonna
regret this. I...

1379
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:08,890
The Bellas are gonna die.
Can I go tell them?

1380
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:10,259
I-I think you misunderstood.

1381
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,029
Uh, what DJ Khaled's
trying to say here

1382
00:57:12,030 --> 00:57:14,830
is that he doesn't want
the Bellas.

1383
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:17,130
We want you.

1384
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:18,469
- What?
- The other day,

1385
00:57:18,470 --> 00:57:21,139
when you was just
playing around with the loop

1386
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:22,870
and you was singing
and you was just...

1387
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:26,279
I could tell that you was
just playing around, but...

1388
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:30,149
I seen something,
I heard something,

1389
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:32,949
then I felt something.

1390
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:34,589
Amidst the chaos,
I went back in the room,

1391
00:57:34,590 --> 00:57:35,989
and I pulled your recording.

1392
00:57:35,990 --> 00:57:39,159
Why did you do that?

1393
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:41,259
Because I wanted to know
what you could do on your own.

1394
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:44,290
Beca, it's time to go
to the next level.

1395
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:45,960
I see it.

1396
00:57:45,970 --> 00:57:48,299
I'm DJ Khaled, aka Billy.

1397
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:51,099
- Who?
- I know these things.

1398
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:54,439
That is so amazing.

1399
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:56,139
That means the world to me,
honestly.

1400
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:58,009
But I'm part of a group,

1401
00:57:58,010 --> 00:57:59,479
and we all have
something special.

1402
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:02,079
I respect
that you love your group,

1403
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:03,610
but it's time for you
to move on.

1404
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:05,349
It's time for you to grow.

1405
00:58:05,350 --> 00:58:08,480
It's time for you to climb that
mountaintop and reach the top.

1406
00:58:08,490 --> 00:58:10,389
And the group
will be happy for you.

1407
00:58:10,390 --> 00:58:12,520
What Khaled is trying
to say here is that

1408
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:15,189
you've really gone as far
as you can with the girls.

1409
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:17,490
It's time for you
to now flourish on your own.

1410
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:20,359
Independent... ly.

1411
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:22,029
These ain't opinions.

1412
00:58:22,030 --> 00:58:23,330
These are facts.

1413
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:24,869
Yes.

1414
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:26,399
Come with me a second.

1415
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:27,639
Bless up.

1416
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:30,009
Listen, I... I know it's a lot

1417
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:31,339
- to take in, okay?
- Uh, yeah.

1418
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:32,979
The label is gonna
sign you, Beca.

1419
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:35,240
The label's gonna sign you.
They're gonna help you

1420
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:37,649
- develop your own material as a solo act.
- Uh, yeah...

1421
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:39,449
Th-This is very generous,

1422
00:58:39,450 --> 00:58:41,319
but we're talking
about my family.

1423
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:43,119
- I'm-I'm... I'm not interested.
- It's...

1424
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:45,150
- It's a tough decision. I get that.
- No, it's not.

1425
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:47,520
It is. It is.

1426
00:58:47,530 --> 00:58:50,529
It's a big opportunity for you.
All right?

1427
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:52,259
Look at me. Stop.

1428
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:54,270
What are you doing?

1429
00:58:56,130 --> 00:58:57,969
Go home. Sleep on it.

1430
00:58:57,970 --> 00:58:59,339
You come back, and you tell me

1431
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:02,439
what you want to do
in the morning, okay?

1432
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:04,409
All right?

1433
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:07,109
I'm... I really am sorry. I...

1434
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:33,639
Whoo!

1435
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:36,669
Your performance
was incredible, Patricia.

1436
00:59:36,670 --> 00:59:38,509
So proud of you.

1437
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:40,139
Thanks, Dad.
How did you see it?

1438
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:41,209
Were you on the base?

1439
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:43,140
Oh, you know me.
I've got my ways.

1440
00:59:43,150 --> 00:59:45,579
What a note to go out on, eh?

1441
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:48,249
What do you say
we leave tonight?

1442
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:51,319
I would, but tomorrow's, like,

1443
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:53,589
the big televised event
with DJ Khaled,

1444
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:56,059
and they're definitely gonna
pick the Bellas to perform.

1445
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:58,489
So I need to be there
'cause my talent compensates

1446
00:59:58,490 --> 01:00:01,199
for the weaker members
of the group, like Beca.

1447
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:02,499
Tomorrow it is.

1448
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:05,229
And you can go
wherever you want to go.

1449
01:00:05,230 --> 01:00:06,969
Urban Outfitters?

1450
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,600
You gotta think bigger,
Sunshine.

1451
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:12,339
A Caribbean tour.

1452
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:14,179
Have you ever been
to Martinique?

1453
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:17,609
Or the, uh...
the Cayman Islands?

1454
01:00:17,610 --> 01:00:20,179
- The Cayman Islands?
- Oh, they're beautiful,

1455
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:22,749
just like my little girl.

1456
01:00:22,750 --> 01:00:24,749
Uh-huh. Right.

1457
01:00:24,750 --> 01:00:26,219
Dad, let me ask you...

1458
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:27,719
what was your favorite moment
of the show?

1459
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:30,359
Well, there were too many
moments of greatness

1460
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,159
from which to choose.

1461
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,190
'Cause my favorite part
was the bit

1462
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:35,499
where I sang that duet
with Beca,

1463
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:37,399
and then was on the top
of the pyramid.

1464
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,329
Oh, yeah.

1465
01:00:39,330 --> 01:00:41,299
Yeah, you were wonderful
in that part.

1466
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:43,369
God! There was no pyramid!

1467
01:00:43,370 --> 01:00:45,439
And as if I'd be the top.

1468
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:48,439
And I know exactly
what's in the Cayman Islands.

1469
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:50,679
Yeah, I do.
That bank account

1470
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:52,779
that Mum set up for me
on my 13th birthday.

1471
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:55,679
She said it was just a bit
of an allowance, but...

1472
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:59,389
I know she didn't want me
to ever need your dirty money.

1473
01:00:59,390 --> 01:01:02,319
How much is even in it anyway?

1474
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:05,490
$180 million, give or take.

1475
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:10,659
When am I gonna learn...

1476
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:12,600
to open my mail?!

1477
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,799
I'm done with you, Dad.

1478
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:18,769
Forever.

1479
01:01:18,770 --> 01:01:21,469
No, no, you're not.

1480
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:24,279
We are done
when I get the money.

1481
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:26,379
Amy?

1482
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:28,310
Is this man bothering you?

1483
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:30,319
- Yes, he is. Yeah.
- Yeah.

1484
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:32,719
Sir, step away from the Bella.

1485
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:36,689
Patricia, all my accounts
are frozen.

1486
01:01:36,690 --> 01:01:39,559
Good-bye, Fergus.

1487
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:43,329
I tried to do this
the nice way, Patricia.

1488
01:01:43,330 --> 01:01:45,770
You remember that!

1489
01:01:47,530 --> 01:01:50,569
So, do you know how to do this?
How do you do this?

1490
01:01:50,570 --> 01:01:52,500
- Pour the water over the sugar, and smash...
- Like this?

1491
01:01:52,510 --> 01:01:53,700
Do you guys know where Beca is?

1492
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:56,309
Theo must have said
something to her by now.

1493
01:01:56,310 --> 01:01:57,779
The show's literally tomorrow.

1494
01:01:57,780 --> 01:02:00,340
- I know.
- Guys, if Khaled picks us,

1495
01:02:00,350 --> 01:02:02,420
it'll be our last show together.

1496
01:02:03,580 --> 01:02:05,749
Bellas, a toast.

1497
01:02:05,750 --> 01:02:08,189
- Ah, a Chloe toast.
- They say that...

1498
01:02:08,190 --> 01:02:10,389
home is where the heart is.

1499
01:02:10,390 --> 01:02:15,729
But you guys are the homes
that my heart lives in.

1500
01:02:15,730 --> 01:02:18,460
I am inside of all of you.

1501
01:02:20,270 --> 01:02:21,700
It feels so good.

1502
01:02:22,730 --> 01:02:25,200
- Cheers. - Cheers.
- Salud. - Cheers!

1503
01:02:25,210 --> 01:02:27,400
- Cheers!
- Guys, I love you so much.

1504
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:29,409
- I feel like...
- Are you hallucinating?

1505
01:02:29,410 --> 01:02:32,309
Excuse me.
Uh, are you the Bellas?

1506
01:02:32,310 --> 01:02:34,209
- Yes.
- Oui, monsieur.

1507
01:02:34,210 --> 01:02:35,649
- Sí.
- My name is Henri.

1508
01:02:35,650 --> 01:02:38,449
Chicago sent me to take you
to the USO reception.

1509
01:02:38,450 --> 01:02:40,180
- Uh...
- Reception? - Huh?

1510
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:42,450
Chicago never mentioned
any reception.

1511
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:45,159
Something about an announcement?

1512
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:47,659
- Oh. We won. - What?
- Did we win?

1513
01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:49,459
Um, we need
to find our friends,

1514
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:51,329
- Beca and Fat Amy.
- Great.

1515
01:02:51,330 --> 01:02:54,360
Oh, they are already there
with Chicago.

1516
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:56,399
- Oh.
- Perfect.

1517
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,269
Let's not keep this
handsome Frenchman waiting.

1518
01:02:59,270 --> 01:03:00,500
- Let's go. Shotgun!
- Ready?

1519
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:01,700
I guess we should go.
Let's go.

1520
01:03:01,710 --> 01:03:04,270
- Yeah. - Come on.
- Hey, let's go. - Henri?

1521
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:06,579
- Oh, yeah. Whoo!
- Sounds like music.

1522
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:09,749
I am Florencia.

The singing sounded very good.

01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:51,519
- Oh, merci beaucoup, Henri.
- Um, are we almost there?

1538
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:53,689
Uh, yes. In fact...

1539
01:03:53,690 --> 01:03:55,789
'Cause it feels like
we've been driving forever.

1540
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:57,390
...we are right here.

1541
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,190
Yay! Oh, great!

1542
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:00,699
I don't know.
I can't lift it.

1543
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:02,499
I can't see.
I can't see anything.

1544
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:03,930
Why won't the shade go up?
It's, like, stuck.

1545
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:05,899
- It's so dark out there.
- Can you guys see out yours?

1546
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:09,569
- No. - No, I can't see.
- Well, this don't seem right.

1547
01:04:09,570 --> 01:04:11,209
Maybe we...

1548
01:04:11,210 --> 01:04:12,339
- Whoa!
- Oh!

1549
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:14,270
What was that?

1550
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:16,780
I don't know. What was that?

1551
01:04:18,580 --> 01:04:20,219
What?

1552
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:23,480
- What happened?
- Huh?

1553
01:04:23,490 --> 01:04:25,289
I don't know.

1554
01:04:25,290 --> 01:04:27,489
Hang on.
You guys, are we...

1555
01:04:27,490 --> 01:04:30,259
Are we floating?

1556
01:04:30,260 --> 01:04:31,989
- Why would we be floating?
- What?

1557
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:37,469
Guys?

1558
01:04:37,470 --> 01:04:38,769
You guys, I can't open the door.

1559
01:04:38,770 --> 01:04:40,499
What? The door's not opening?

1560
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:42,939
It's the old van-ferry
death-trap maneuver.

1561
01:04:42,940 --> 01:04:45,270
I should've seen it coming.

1562
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:46,509
- Oh, God.
- What?

1563
01:04:46,510 --> 01:04:48,879
- Open it. Open the door.
- Help!

1564
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:50,009
Does... does anybody's
cell phone work?

1565
01:04:50,010 --> 01:04:51,010
Where's my cell phone?

1566
01:04:51,011 --> 01:04:52,309
No service.

1567
01:04:52,310 --> 01:04:53,749
No service. There's nothing.

1568
01:04:53,750 --> 01:04:56,449
- That's so inconvenient.
- Hell's bells!

1569
01:04:56,450 --> 01:04:57,780
We could scream
on the count of three.

1570
01:04:57,790 --> 01:04:59,819
- Okay. One, two, three.
- One, two, three!

1571
01:04:59,820 --> 01:05:01,360
Help!

1572
01:05:09,460 --> 01:05:11,830
Sir Bounce-a-lot.

1573
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:32,389
- I told you we're through!
- I know.

1574
01:05:32,390 --> 01:05:34,719
But there are some people here

1575
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:37,559
who think you should reconsider.

1576
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:40,959
Amy!

1577
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:44,899
How could you?

1578
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:47,799
I swear to God,
if you hurt any one of them,

1579
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:50,900
except for Jessica and Ashley,
I will kill you!

1580
01:05:50,910 --> 01:05:52,869
I don't want to hurt anyone,
Patricia.

1581
01:05:52,870 --> 01:05:55,839
The only one I wanted was you,
but you weren't with them,

1582
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:57,409
were you?

1583
01:05:57,410 --> 01:05:59,079
Oh, well.

1584
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,049
Plan B.

1585
01:06:01,050 --> 01:06:03,319
You have 30 minutes.

1586
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:04,780
Come to the boat,

1587
01:06:04,790 --> 01:06:07,489
or your friends
swim with the fishies.

1588
01:06:07,490 --> 01:06:09,959
And I think you know I mean it.

1589
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:11,789
Oh, I know you mean it.

1590
01:06:11,790 --> 01:06:13,659
Because you're a terrible person

1591
01:06:13,660 --> 01:06:15,929
that does terrible things.

1592
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:18,529
But there's one thing
you're forgetting, Dad.

1593
01:06:18,530 --> 01:06:19,899
I'm your daughter.

1594
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:23,399
Your nightmare blood,
it runs through my veins!

1595
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:25,100
Hey, Amy, um, I need to talk
to you about something.

1596
01:06:25,110 --> 01:06:27,709
- It's kind of important.
- Oh, yeah, just a sec.

1597
01:06:27,710 --> 01:06:29,339
- I'm on a call.
- Okay.

1598
01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:30,570
You think you're bad?

1599
01:06:30,580 --> 01:06:33,909
You have no idea
what I'm capable of.

1600
01:06:33,910 --> 01:06:35,979
I've graduated college.

1601
01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:37,679
I could do anything.

1602
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:40,019
So say your prayers,

1603
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:43,019
'cause Fat Amy is coming...

1604
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:45,889
for you.

1605
01:06:45,890 --> 01:06:47,629
Now!

1606
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:53,029
So...

1607
01:06:53,030 --> 01:06:55,569
which two of you

1608
01:06:55,570 --> 01:06:57,800
are Ashley and Jessica?

1609
01:06:59,410 --> 01:07:01,739
- Ah, shit.
- Okay, so...

1610
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:02,809
I have kind of bad news.

1611
01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:05,079
Uh, and I know you're
gonna be fine. Uh, I know

1612
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:07,320
- every-everybody's gonna be fine, but, like...
- Uh-huh.

1613
01:07:08,820 --> 01:07:10,149
Oh.

1614
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:13,019
- Um, w-well...
- Yep.

1615
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:15,019
We didn't get picked, man.
And you know what?

1616
01:07:15,020 --> 01:07:17,750
Like, screw them. It's not,
like, the whole story.

1617
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:20,759
There's... uh, uh, uh...

1618
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:22,759
I don't know, I still feel
like I want to tell you

1619
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:23,630
'cause I think that, like,

1620
01:07:23,631 --> 01:07:25,599
secrets are, like,
the worst, right?

1621
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:26,760
So...

1622
01:07:26,770 --> 01:07:28,629
Yeah, it's the worst.

1623
01:07:28,630 --> 01:07:30,030
Let's go.

1624
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:31,499
Go where?

1625
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:33,910
Don't worry.
We'll change in the cab.

1626
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:40,709
Amy, what are we doing?

1627
01:07:40,710 --> 01:07:43,049
Why are we not calling
the police or Chicago?

1628
01:07:43,050 --> 01:07:45,019
No cops. There's no time.

1629
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:47,549
And if my dad sees 'em,
he'll take off.

1630
01:07:47,550 --> 01:07:48,749
This is serious.

1631
01:07:48,750 --> 01:07:50,519
The Bellas
could really get hurt.

1632
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:52,489
- Not on my watch.
- Amy, come on.

1633
01:07:52,490 --> 01:07:54,059
Look, I know my father.

1634
01:07:54,060 --> 01:07:55,659
I know his guys.

1635
01:07:55,660 --> 01:07:57,790
Some of them I know,
like, really well.

1636
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:00,160
And I know that boat.

1637
01:08:00,170 --> 01:08:02,060
We can do this.

1638
01:08:02,070 --> 01:08:04,029
Okay. What's the plan?

1639
01:08:04,030 --> 01:08:06,899
First up, I need you
to pick up the pace.

1640
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:08,810
This boat's not gonna
row itself.

1641
01:08:13,950 --> 01:08:15,949
Okay. That's the ladder
that'll take you

1642
01:08:15,950 --> 01:08:17,779
up to the main deck
where the Bellas are.

1643
01:08:17,780 --> 01:08:19,710
Do not let Fergus
hear what I'm doing below.

1644
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:21,719
Okay, giant distraction
coming up.

1645
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:24,149
- You sure about this?
- Have I ever let you down?

1646
01:08:24,150 --> 01:08:27,019
Dozens of examples
spring to mind, if I'm honest.

1647
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:29,059
- What?
- Yeah, you're very unreliable.

1648
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:31,059
It's, like, one of the
hallmarks of your personality.

1649
01:08:31,060 --> 01:08:33,660
I don't think we have time
to unpack that right now.

1650
01:08:33,670 --> 01:08:35,960
Shh. I'll just see you up top.

1651
01:08:35,970 --> 01:08:37,599
Nobody's gonna die tonight,
right?

1652
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:38,899
- Yeah.
- Right?

1653
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:40,839
- Yeah.
- Well, that doesn't help.

1654
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:42,469
- Okay.
- Okay, ready?

1655
01:08:42,470 --> 01:08:43,909
I've got my serious face on now.

1656
01:08:43,910 --> 01:08:45,709
- Okay.
- It's time.

1657
01:08:45,710 --> 01:08:47,839
Let's do it.

1658
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:51,479
Once we get the money,
we sail directly to Sydney.

1659
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:53,710
Unless she doesn't show.

1660
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:56,519
Then things get ugly.

1661
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:58,119
Ten minutes, ladies.

1662
01:08:58,120 --> 01:09:00,590
Guys, you know
what we should do?

1663
01:09:01,790 --> 01:09:03,120
Where did you come from?

1664
01:09:03,130 --> 01:09:04,259
What?

1665
01:09:04,260 --> 01:09:05,590
You weren't here before.

1666
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,599
I've been here the whole time.

1667
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:10,030
I'm just small.

1668
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:19,709
Just... if we only have
ten minutes left,

1669
01:09:19,710 --> 01:09:22,879
I say we spend it
doing something we love.

1670
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:27,150
Let's go out like Bellas and...
and sing one more song.

1671
01:09:29,150 --> 01:09:31,949
You want to sing right now?

1672
01:09:31,950 --> 01:09:34,150
I think we should sing
one more song, though.

1673
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:36,159
I don't know if I feel like singing.

1674
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:39,860
Oh, my God. Guys, I just want
to sing so bad.

1675
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:42,999
We really think you'll like it.

1676
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,969
You want to entertain me?

1677
01:09:44,970 --> 01:09:47,030
Knock yourselves out.

1678
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:48,769
Nine minutes.

1679
01:09:48,770 --> 01:09:50,769
Let's make it a loud one, guys.

1680
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:52,669
You are terrible
at reading signals.

1681
01:09:52,670 --> 01:09:54,810

01:12:07,110 --> 01:12:09,209
Do you remember me?

1708
01:12:09,210 --> 01:12:13,009
How could I forget the girl
who gave me this?

1709
01:12:13,010 --> 01:12:15,379
You really shouldn't
have put me in a time-out.

1710
01:12:17,180 --> 01:12:19,250
Let's dance.

1711
01:12:23,750 --> 01:12:25,119
Why?

1712
01:12:34,070 --> 01:12:36,299
Whoa. Easy, now. Easy.

1713
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:38,970
Easy, now.

1714
01:12:41,910 --> 01:12:43,469
Come on. Yeah?

1715
01:12:43,470 --> 01:12:45,279
What?

1716
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:14,969
Nipple cripple!

1717
01:13:14,970 --> 01:13:17,009
Nipple cripple!

1718
01:13:17,010 --> 01:13:18,980
Take it.

1719
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:25,920
This is way too much cardio.

1720
01:13:29,820 --> 01:13:31,320

Go, go, go!

1729
01:14:21,970 --> 01:14:23,539
Come out here! Amy!

1730
01:14:23,540 --> 01:14:25,569
Amy, come on! Amy!

1731
01:14:31,450 --> 01:14:33,450
Sweet baby Jesus!

1732
01:14:36,950 --> 01:14:38,519
Amy, let's go!

1733
01:14:43,490 --> 01:14:46,489
- Amy, come on!
- Patricia!

1734
01:14:46,490 --> 01:14:48,330
Stop her!

1735
01:14:59,340 --> 01:15:01,439
- Beca! Beca!
- Amy!

1736
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:04,979
Hey, you've been a very
naughty girl, Turnip Top!

1737
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:06,379
Amy! Amy!

1738
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:08,210
Amy!

1739
01:15:13,590 --> 01:15:17,959
I rained hellfire!

1740
01:15:32,370 --> 01:15:33,939
The MPs arrested Amy's dad.

1741
01:15:33,940 --> 01:15:35,370
He's going to jail
for a long time.

1742
01:15:35,380 --> 01:15:37,039
I'm gonna go meet them,
all right?

1743
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:38,480
- Okay.
- Sit tight.

1744
01:15:39,550 --> 01:15:41,379
I have no idea
what just happened,

1745
01:15:41,380 --> 01:15:43,919
but if Khaled doesn't pick us
after all of that,

1746
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:45,449
what are we doing
with our lives?

1747
01:15:45,450 --> 01:15:47,950
- Right? - I know.
- Mm-hmm. - Seriously.

1748
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:49,250
Uh, I think Beca has something

1749
01:15:49,260 --> 01:15:51,390
she'd like to share
with the group.

1750
01:15:52,460 --> 01:15:54,359
Um, thanks, Amy.

1751
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:55,559
Uh, yeah.

1752
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:59,129
I was gonna say something
earlier, but we were involved

1753
01:15:59,130 --> 01:16:01,160
in a hostage crisis,
so I just...

1754
01:16:01,170 --> 01:16:02,400
They picked her.

1755
01:16:03,540 --> 01:16:05,400
DJ Khaled and his team.

1756
01:16:05,410 --> 01:16:06,669
They didn't pick the Bellas.

1757
01:16:06,670 --> 01:16:08,539
They picked Beca.

1758
01:16:08,540 --> 01:16:10,609
So they... yeah,
so they only picked her.

1759
01:16:10,610 --> 01:16:13,940
Yeah, but I said no because
I feel exactly how you feel.

1760
01:16:13,950 --> 01:16:16,979
You guys are family, and you
don't walk away from family.

1761
01:16:16,980 --> 01:16:18,679
Don't you want to make music?

1762
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:20,249
No, I guess, but...

1763
01:16:20,250 --> 01:16:22,919
Beca, you can't say no.
You've gotta do it.

1764
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:25,219
Look, your real family
doesn't hold you back.

1765
01:16:25,220 --> 01:16:27,160
They lift you up.

1766
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:31,190
Kind of feel like I've been
saying something to that effect

1767
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:32,529
- the entire time.
- Oh, my God, Emily!

1768
01:16:32,530 --> 01:16:35,429
Smart people
are talking right now.

1769
01:16:35,430 --> 01:16:37,530
Aubrey, don't, please.

1770
01:16:37,540 --> 01:16:39,539
It's... I-I won't do it.
It's not important.

1771
01:16:39,540 --> 01:16:40,739
No, no, no.
It's-it's not that.

1772
01:16:40,740 --> 01:16:43,670
You know, I have
to be honest with you guys.

1773
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:47,279
Every time I perform
in front of people,

1774
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:49,449
I feel like I'm gonna puke.

1775
01:16:49,450 --> 01:16:51,719
And I don't have to anymore.

1776
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:54,580
I'm so happy.

1777
01:16:54,590 --> 01:16:56,719
- Aw.
- Yes!

1778
01:16:56,720 --> 01:16:58,459
- No more puking.
- Whew!

1779
01:16:58,460 --> 01:17:00,220
- No more puke.
- No more puke.

1780
01:17:00,230 --> 01:17:01,489
Yes.

1781
01:17:01,490 --> 01:17:03,590
You know what?
I think I might just...

1782
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:07,529
I don't know, move to Mykonos
and become a doula.

1783
01:17:07,530 --> 01:17:10,069
- A doula?
- A birthing coach.

1784
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:12,099
- You gonna coach babies?
- Mm-hmm.

1785
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:13,610
Yeah, I'll be like...

1786
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:17,039
"Come here, little guy.
You can do it.

1787
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:18,509
"There ain't really
nothing to it.

1788
01:17:18,510 --> 01:17:20,679
You can do it,
you can do it. Come on!"

1789
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:22,449
- Ah...
- Now that gay people

1790
01:17:22,450 --> 01:17:25,249
can serve in the military,
I'm-a join the Air Force

1791
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:27,319
and let them pay
for my flight school.

1792
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:31,289
I have my Abnormal Psych exam
coming up next week.

1793
01:17:31,290 --> 01:17:33,559
But also, you're gonna
keep writing

1794
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:37,159
so your life isn't filled
with crushing regret, right?

1795
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:39,059
- Yes.
- Good.

1796
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:40,499
Well, guys, a music career

1797
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:42,560
would interfere
with my business, so...

1798
01:17:42,570 --> 01:17:45,739
Yeah, that little tiny
juice truck you work at.

1799
01:17:45,740 --> 01:17:47,139
The juice truck I own

1800
01:17:47,140 --> 01:17:49,369
and just secured capital
to franchise.

1801
01:17:49,370 --> 01:17:51,409
- So... - EMILY: Uh, what?
- Oh! - Cool.

1802
01:17:51,410 --> 01:17:54,540
- I didn't tell you guys?
- Congratulations.

1803
01:17:54,550 --> 01:17:56,110
Cool beans.

1804
01:17:57,110 --> 01:17:58,510
You talk?

1805
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:02,119
Satan has finally left my body.

1806
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:05,450
Hi. I'm Esther.

1807
01:18:05,460 --> 01:18:08,120
- Wha...?
- I have many questions.

1808
01:18:08,130 --> 01:18:11,159
You guys?

1809
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:13,429
I think it's time that we go on

1810
01:18:13,430 --> 01:18:15,529
with the next chapter
of our lives.

1811
01:18:15,530 --> 01:18:19,369
It's time for us to move on.
You know?

1812
01:18:19,370 --> 01:18:21,700
I mean, we're always gonna
be there for each other

1813
01:18:21,710 --> 01:18:23,609
because we're family.

1814
01:18:23,610 --> 01:18:26,270
And, I mean, I, for one,
am very ready.

1815
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:28,540
I got the call that I got
into vet school.

1816
01:18:28,550 --> 01:18:30,649
- You got in!
- Yes, I got in. I know.

1817
01:18:30,650 --> 01:18:33,619
- No way! - Oh!
- I got in. I'm a vet.

1818
01:18:33,620 --> 01:18:35,649
Congratulations!

1819
01:18:35,650 --> 01:18:37,319
What about you, Ames?

1820
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:39,119
You sure you're cool with this?

1821
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:40,250
Are you kidding me?

1822
01:18:40,260 --> 01:18:42,489
I just found out
I got $180 million

1823
01:18:42,490 --> 01:18:44,689
to put into
"Fat Amy Winehouse."

1824
01:18:44,690 --> 01:18:45,560
- What?
- Yeah.

1825
01:18:45,561 --> 01:18:49,429
- Whoa.
- Wait, I could do more shows.

1826
01:18:49,430 --> 01:18:52,569
"Fat Amy Adams."
"Fat Amy Grant."

1827
01:18:52,570 --> 01:18:54,299
Oh, that would be good
for Christmas.

1828
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:55,399
Would be great.

1829
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:58,239
- Beca.
- Don't.

1830
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:00,339
I swear to God,
don't make that face.

1831
01:19:00,340 --> 01:19:03,409
If you cry, I'm gonna cry.
I swear.

1832
01:19:03,410 --> 01:19:05,179
I'm not gonna do this
with you today, so...

1833
01:19:05,180 --> 01:19:06,449
- I'm not doing it.
- I hate that face.

1834
01:19:06,450 --> 01:19:08,219
- I'm not.
- Don't make that face.

1835
01:19:08,220 --> 01:19:09,780
- Don't.
- This is my regular face.

1836
01:19:09,790 --> 01:19:11,249
You know how much I love you.

1837
01:19:11,250 --> 01:19:14,619
You just get out there,
and you crush it.

1838
01:19:14,620 --> 01:19:15,689
Okay?

1839
01:19:15,690 --> 01:19:17,459
You crush it so hard

1840
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:20,359
that your nips tingle a bit.

1841
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:21,559
- She loves hugs.
- Don't. - Bring it in.

1842
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:22,860
- That's not funny.
- We should give her one.

1843
01:19:22,870 --> 01:19:26,730
- I... - Yay!
- Hugger!

01:19:46,690 --> 01:19:50,389
of the USO Tour
in the South of France,

1854
01:19:50,390 --> 01:19:51,889
coming to you from the Citadel.

1855
01:19:51,890 --> 01:19:55,490
What a gorgeous setting
here tonight under the stars.

1856
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:57,259
Isn't this beautiful?
Doing a wonderful

1857
01:19:57,260 --> 01:19:59,360
musical presentation
in a bunker.

1858
01:19:59,370 --> 01:20:00,599
In the South of France.

1859
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:02,399
I mean, it's so romantic here.

1860
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:03,869
I've never been to France.

1861
01:20:03,870 --> 01:20:05,369
I hope never to come back.

1862
01:20:05,370 --> 01:20:06,769
Oh, no, it's not
a place for you.

1863
01:20:06,770 --> 01:20:08,739
Oh, no, no.
There's no good people here.

1864
01:20:08,740 --> 01:20:09,770
No, no.

1865
01:20:09,780 --> 01:20:10,909
On your toes, folks.

1866
01:20:10,910 --> 01:20:13,320
We're on in ten.
First positions.

1867
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:20,519
Ladies and gentlemen,

1868
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:24,689
let's give it up for DJ Khaled!

1869
01:20:28,230 --> 01:20:31,260
When I say "fan,"
you say "love."

1870
01:20:31,270 --> 01:20:32,360
Fan!

1871
01:20:32,370 --> 01:20:33,729
- Love!
- Fan!

1872
01:20:33,730 --> 01:20:34,430
Love!

1873
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:36,269
First of all, I want to thank

1874
01:20:36,270 --> 01:20:38,269
all the troops
for coming out here.

1875
01:20:38,270 --> 01:20:39,800
It's about you.

1876
01:20:39,810 --> 01:20:41,239
We salute you.

1877
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:43,409
We praise you and thank you.

1878
01:20:43,410 --> 01:20:45,779
But tonight I have a surprise.

1879
01:20:45,780 --> 01:20:50,279
I'll be introducing you
to a new star.

1880
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:51,519
A superstar.

1881
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:54,589
Somebody that I have cosigned.

1882
01:20:54,590 --> 01:20:57,219
I introduce you to...

1883
01:20:57,220 --> 01:20:59,359
Beca Mitchell.

1884
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:05,460
And here's Beca Mitchell
stepping onto the stage,

1885
01:21:05,470 --> 01:21:07,869

the day she was born.

1886
01:21:07,870 --> 01:21:10,630
You know, we've been following
this little sprite-light lady

1887
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:12,969
for, I don't know,
seven years now, I think.

1888
01:21:12,970 --> 01:21:14,709
We have been showing you

1889
01:21:14,710 --> 01:21:16,870
her new life
out in the real world,

1890
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:19,509
where she's out to take
another perfectly good job

1891
01:21:19,510 --> 01:21:20,850
from an able-bodied man.

1892
01:21:21,950 --> 01:21:23,710
