2
00:00:59,252 --> 00:01:01,345

5
00:01:11,264 --> 00:01:15,496
{\fn幼圓}然後光著腳在地毯上走走 把腳趾蜷起來{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Then you walk around on the rug barefoot and make fists with your toes.{\r}

6
00:01:16,803 --> 00:01:18,896
{\fn幼圓}把腳趾蜷起來?{\r}

{\fn幼圓}實際上,我想的是芬芳美酒 和美味奶酪{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Actually, I was thinking more of mulled wine, a nice, aged Brie{\r}

29
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:37,473

{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Did Mr McClane call?{\r}

49
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,580
{\fn幼圓}沒有,荷莉太太,沒有電話{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}No, Mrs Holly. No telefono.{\r}

50

{\fn幼圓}也許他上飛機前沒時間打{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}He probably didn't have time before his flight.{\r}

51
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,818
{\fn幼圓}你最好還是把客房收拾好{\r}

55
00:05:29,622 --> 00:05:30,816

{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}California!{\r}

56
00:05:43,903 --> 00:05:45,996
{\fn幼圓}我是約翰．麥克連{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Hey, I'm John McClane.{\r}

57
00:05:46,072 --> 00:05:48,632

60
00:06:01,654 --> 00:06:06,455
{\fn幼圓}我還以為你知道呢 我是第一次開這種車{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I was hoping you could tell me. It's my first time driving a limo.{\r}

61
00:06:06,526 --> 00:06:09,552
{\fn幼圓}沒關係,這也是我第一次坐這種車{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}That's OK. It's my first time riding in one.{\r}

62
00:06:09,829 --> 00:06:12,423
{\fn幼圓}放鬆,這堶n什麼有什麼{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Relax. We got everything in this mug.{\r}

{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}If your friend's hot to trot, I know a few mama bears we can hook up with.{\r}

66
00:06:26,078 --> 00:06:28,911
{\fn幼圓}-或是說他結婚了? -他結婚了{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}- Or is he married? - He's married.{\r}

67
00:06:32,485 --> 00:06:37,582
{\fn幼圓}好吧 哦,真對不起,清潔工今天放假 沒想到你會坐前排{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Sorry about that. It's the girl's day off. I didn't know you were gonna sit up front.{\r}

68
00:06:37,657 --> 00:06:39,488
{\fn幼圓}你太太住在這兒?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Your lady live out here?{\r}

{\fn幼圓}差不多六個月了{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}About the past six months.{\r}

70
00:06:42,028 --> 00:06:44,292
{\fn幼圓}這麼說你還住在紐約{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Meaning you still live in New York?{\r}

71
00:06:45,097 --> 00:06:48,225
{\fn幼圓}你總是有這麼多問題嗎,阿蓋?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}You always ask this many questions, Argyle?{\r}

72
00:06:48,301 --> 00:06:52,931
{\fn幼圓}對不起,我以前開出租車 總喜歡和別人聊聊{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Sorry. I used to drive a cab and people would expect a little chitchat.{\r}

73
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,304
{\fn幼圓}-你離婚了? -開你的車吧,夥計{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}- So, you divorced? - Just drive the car, man.{\r}

74
00:06:56,409 --> 00:07:00,243
{\fn幼圓}嘿,說吧,你離婚了? 還是分居?她打你嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Hey, come on. You divorced? You separated? She beat you up?!{\r}

75
00:07:03,149 --> 00:07:07,245
{\fn幼圓}她有份好工作,現在是事業有成{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}She had a good job. It turned into a great career.{\r}

76
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,948
{\fn幼圓}-所以她不得不搬到這兒 -你腦子挺靈的,阿蓋{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}That meant she had to move here.{\r}

77
00:07:10,289 --> 00:07:15,022
{\fn幼圓}那你幹嘛不到這來?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}- You're very fast, Argyle. - So, why didn't you come?{\r}

78
00:07:17,697 --> 00:07:21,155
{\fn幼圓}你幹嘛不和她一起來 夥計?怎麼了?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Well? Why didn't you come with her? What's up?{\r}

79
00:07:21,267 --> 00:07:23,098
{\fn幼圓}因為我是紐約警察{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Because I'm a New York cop.{\r}

80
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:26,900
{\fn幼圓}我還有一堆紐約人渣要抓{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I got a backlog of scumbags I'm still trying to put behind bars.{\r}

81
00:07:26,973 --> 00:07:28,964
{\fn幼圓}我不能拍拍屁股就離開{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I can'tjust go that easy.{\r}

82
00:07:29,075 --> 00:07:31,339
{\fn幼圓}換句話說 你覺得她在這兒不會成功{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}You thought she wasn't gonna make it here{\r}

83
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:35,972
{\fn幼圓}她會回去你身邊 那就不用收拾行李了,對吧?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}and she'd come crawling back to you so why bother to pack, right?{\r}

84
00:07:36,082 --> 00:07:39,108
{\fn幼圓}沒錯,你的腦子確實很靈,阿蓋{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Like I said, you're very fast, Argyle.{\r}

85
00:07:39,185 --> 00:07:40,743
{\fn幼圓}聽聽音樂可以嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Mind if we hear some tunes?{\r}

86
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:46,654
{\fn幼圓}嘿,真不錯{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Hey, that'll work.{\r}

87
00:07:49,262 --> 00:07:50,661
{\fn幼圓}聽聽聖誕歌曲好嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Don't you got any Christmas music?{\r}

88
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,455
{\fn幼圓}這就是聖誕歌曲{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}This is Christmas music.{\r}

89
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:25,222
{\fn幼圓}等一下你太太見到你,你們緊緊擁抱{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}So your lady sees you, you run into her arms,{\r}

90
00:08:25,331 --> 00:08:28,823
{\fn幼圓}接著音樂響起 從此就幸福生活,是嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}the music comes up and you live happily ever after, right?{\r}

91
00:08:29,101 --> 00:08:31,160
{\fn幼圓}這個計劃不錯{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I can live with that.{\r}

92
00:08:31,971 --> 00:08:35,805
{\fn幼圓}如果這招不管用 你要找個地方住嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}So, if it doesn't work out, you got a place to stay?{\r}

93

{\fn幼圓}你得原諒艾利斯 他每年這個時候都很沮喪{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}You have to forgive Ellis. He gets very depressed this time of year.{\r}

153
00:14:22,788 --> 00:14:26,053
{\fn幼圓}他總是認為自己的天賦最高 明白嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}He thought he was God's greatest gift, you know?{\r}

154

158
00:14:38,737 --> 00:14:41,501
{\fn幼圓}我還來不及打電話問你{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I didn't get a chance to ask you on the phone.{\r}

159
00:14:41,573 --> 00:14:44,064

{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}OK.{\r}

291
00:31:35,953 --> 00:31:37,386
{\fn幼圓}看來只好費些力氣了{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}We do it the hard way.{\r}

292
00:31:37,455 --> 00:31:39,446

{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}See to Heinrich.{\r}

296
00:32:13,391 --> 00:32:14,790

{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Now...{\r}

298
00:32:18,396 --> 00:32:22,924
{\fn幼圓}你帶我來只是因為我的 相貌英俊嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}You didn't bring me along for my charming personality.{\r}

299
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:32,499

{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Sweetheart, have I ever lied to you?{\r}

302
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:41,684
{\fn幼圓}我的老闆? 他還以為我去了賭城呢{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}My boss thinks I'm on my way to Vegas.{\r}

303
00:32:43,054 --> 00:32:45,522

{\fn幼圓}抓到了,尤里{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Uli.{\r}

309

{\fn幼圓}破解密碼需要三十分鐘{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}30 minutes to break the code,{\r}

310
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:31,300

311
00:33:31,369 --> 00:33:34,532

{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I'm sorry?{\r}

313
00:33:58,696 --> 00:34:02,132
{\fn幼圓}第七道鎖 是電磁密封裝置{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}The 7th lock... the electromagnetic seal.{\r}

314
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,600
{\fn幼圓}在這堶接L法切斷電路{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}The circuits cannot be cut locally.{\r}

315
00:34:06,404 --> 00:34:07,666
{\fn幼圓}相信我{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Trust me.{\r}

316
00:34:09,473 --> 00:34:12,533

{\fn幼圓}因為這樣你也死定了,是嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}'Cause then you'd be dead, too, asshole.{\r}

318
00:34:16,547 --> 00:34:18,538
{\fn幼圓}冷靜,混蛋,冷靜!{\r}

{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Then disable the sys...{\r}

323
00:34:43,808 --> 00:34:46,743
{\fn幼圓}艾迪,警報是哪一層發出的?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Eddie, on what floor did the alarm go off?{\r}

324
00:34:48,246 --> 00:34:50,407
{\fn幼圓}我們能走了嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Shall we go?{\r}

325
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,120
{\fn幼圓}行{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Yes.{\r}

{\fn幼圓}火警已經解除了,朋友{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}The fire has been called off, my friend.{\r}

333
00:36:06,891 --> 00:36:09,291
{\fn幼圓}沒人會來幫你的{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}No one is coming to help you.{\r}

334
00:36:13,297 --> 00:36:16,528
{\fn幼圓}你應該出來和大家在一起{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}You might as well come out and join the others.{\r}

335
00:36:19,203 --> 00:36:21,296
{\fn幼圓}我保證絕不傷害你{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I promise I won't hurt you.{\r}

336
00:36:50,835 --> 00:36:53,963
{\fn幼圓}放下槍,白癡 我是警察{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Drop it, dickhead. It's the police.{\r}

337
00:36:54,071 --> 00:36:55,834
{\fn幼圓}你不會傷害我{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}You won't hurt me.{\r}

338
00:36:55,906 --> 00:36:57,703
{\fn幼圓}哦,是嗎?為什麼?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Yeah? Why not?{\r}

339
00:36:57,775 --> 00:36:59,675
{\fn幼圓}因為你是警察{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Because you're a policeman.{\r}

340
00:36:59,744 --> 00:37:02,144
{\fn幼圓}警察要遵守規定{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}There are rules for policemen.{\r}

341
00:37:02,246 --> 00:37:05,738
{\fn幼圓}對,我的上司也這麼說{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Yeah, that's what my captain keeps telling me.{\r}

342
00:38:08,438 --> 00:38:10,055
{\fn幼圓}「密碼有效，一號鎖解除」{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}{\r}

343
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,155
{\fn幼圓}「繼續操作嗎?」{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}{\r}

344
00:38:12,416 --> 00:38:14,577
{\fn幼圓}大傻瓜,當然繼續{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Bet your ass I wish to proceed.{\r}

345
00:38:54,892 --> 00:38:56,860
{\fn幼圓}全世界有九百萬恐怖分子{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Nine million terrorists in the world{\r}

346
00:38:56,961 --> 00:39:00,021
{\fn幼圓}我卻殺了一個 腳比我妹妹還小的傢伙{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}and I gotta kill one with feet smaller than my sister.{\r}

347
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:54,110
{\fn幼圓}我希望這是一次 職業的、有效的、合作性的接觸{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I wanted this to be professional, efficient, adult, cooperative.{\r}

348
00:39:54,218 --> 00:39:56,049
{\fn幼圓}不要問的太多{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Not a lot to ask.{\r}

349
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,315
{\fn幼圓}可惜,你們的青木先生不這樣看{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Mr Takagi did not see it that way{\r}

350
00:39:58,422 --> 00:40:02,085
{\fn幼圓}所以他的餘生無法和大家在一起了{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}so he won't be joining us for the rest of his life.{\r}

351
00:40:04,228 --> 00:40:06,321
{\fn幼圓}事態的發展是由你們決定的{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}We can go any way you want it.{\r}

352
00:40:07,331 --> 00:40:10,232
{\fn幼圓}你們可以走出去,也可以被抬出去{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}You can walk out of here or be carried out{\r}

353
00:40:10,301 --> 00:40:14,328
{\fn幼圓}請不要心存幻想,我們是主宰者{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}but have no illusions... we are in charge.{\r}

354
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:19,707
{\fn幼圓}現在大家來決定吧{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}So... decide now, each of you{\r}

355
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:21,844
{\fn幼圓}請記住…{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}and please remember...{\r}

356
00:40:23,314 --> 00:40:25,441
{\fn幼圓}任何可能的情況我們都考慮到了{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}we have left nothing to chance.{\r}

357
00:40:33,791 --> 00:40:35,122
{\fn幼圓}拿回來!{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Get them back!{\r}

358
00:40:44,969 --> 00:40:47,403
{\fn幼圓}「現在我有一支機關鎗」{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}"Now I have a machine gun."{\r}

359
00:40:49,303 --> 00:40:52,947
{\fn幼圓}「呵-呵-呵」(模仿聖誕老人){\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}{\r}

360
00:40:55,312 --> 00:40:57,303
{\fn幼圓}是漏網的警衛?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}A security guard we missed?{\r}

361
00:40:57,381 --> 00:41:02,785
{\fn幼圓}警衛都是吃養老金的胖老頭 不,肯定另有他人{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}They're usually tired, old policemen. No, this is something else.{\r}

362
00:41:12,162 --> 00:41:14,289
{\fn幼圓}我們必須採取措施,漢斯{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}We have to do something, Hans.{\r}

363
00:41:14,365 --> 00:41:15,593
{\fn幼圓}是的,是的{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Yes, we do.{\r}

364
00:41:15,699 --> 00:41:20,193
{\fn幼圓}告訴卡爾,他弟弟死了 叫他下來{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Tell Karl his brother is dead. Tell him to come down.{\r}

365
00:41:24,174 --> 00:41:27,803
{\fn幼圓}法蘭柯 你和佛塈漇芶撽翵儤茪W{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Franco, Fritz, take the body upstairs and out of sight.{\r}

366
00:41:27,945 --> 00:41:31,574
{\fn幼圓}我不要讓人質亂想{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I don't want the hostages to think too much.{\r}

367
00:42:35,045 --> 00:42:36,808
{\fn幼圓}我要報仇!{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I want blood!{\r}

368
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,974
{\fn幼圓}會有機會的! 不過先讓亨利裝好炸藥{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}You'll have it, but let Heinrich plant the detonators{\r}

369
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:42,644
{\fn幼圓}弄開金庫,我們報警後{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}and Theo prepare the vault. After we call the police,{\r}

370
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,917
{\fn幼圓}到時你要把大樓拆了都行{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}you can tear the building apart looking for this man{\r}

371
00:42:46,023 --> 00:42:48,856
{\fn幼圓}在那之前,我們不能改變計劃!{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}but, until then, do not alter the plan!{\r}

372
00:42:49,293 --> 00:42:51,523
{\fn幼圓}如果他改變我們的計劃呢？{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}And if he alters it?{\r}

373
00:42:56,333 --> 00:42:58,233
{\fn幼圓}你認為是怎麼回事?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}What do you think?{\r}

374
00:43:00,204 --> 00:43:02,297
{\fn幼圓}有些不對頭{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Something's wrong.{\r}

375
00:43:02,406 --> 00:43:03,703
{\fn幼圓}也許{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Cops?{\r}

376
00:43:05,642 --> 00:43:08,076
{\fn幼圓}-是約翰 -約翰?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}- John. - John?{\r}

377
00:43:08,445 --> 00:43:11,903
{\fn幼圓}天哪!他會把一切都搞糟的! 他以為自己在幹什麼?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}He can fuck this up. What does he think he's doing?{\r}

{\fn幼圓}馬上來! 聽見沒有?馬上!{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Now, goddamn it! Now!{\r}

473
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:57,114
{\fn幼圓}莫妮卡,我會搞定餐館預約{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Monica, I can get us a table.{\r}

474
00:57:58,284 --> 00:58:00,809
{\fn幼圓}沃夫岡和我是很好的朋友{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Wolfgang and I are very close friends.{\r}

475
00:58:01,387 --> 00:58:03,014
{\fn幼圓}我採訪過他,保證沒問題{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I interviewed him!{\r}

476
00:58:03,122 --> 00:58:04,817
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}...Nakatomi.{\r}
{\fn幼圓}{\r}

477
00:58:04,923 --> 00:58:07,551
{\fn幼圓}重複,有警察需要增援…{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Repeat. Officer needs assistance at...{\r}

478
00:58:07,693 --> 00:58:11,356
{\fn幼圓}我在中富大廈! 我的車被打成篩子啦!{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I'm at Nakatomi Plaza. They're turning my car into Swiss cheese!{\r}

479
00:58:11,430 --> 00:58:15,491
{\fn幼圓}我需要支援,快點來! 他媽的,馬上!{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I need backup assistance now! Now, goddamn it! Now!{\r}

480
00:58:36,388 --> 00:58:38,379
{\fn幼圓}沒想到聽到警笛這麼高興!{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Never thought I'd love to hear that sound.{\r}

481
00:58:38,657 --> 00:58:43,060
{\fn幼圓}大家不要緊張 只是一點麻煩,沒什麼{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}All of you relax. This is a matter of inconvenient timing, that's all.{\r}

482
00:58:43,162 --> 00:58:47,929
{\fn幼圓}警方的行動是不可避免的 而且是必要的{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Police action was inevitable... and, as it happens, necessary.{\r}

483
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,436
{\fn幼圓}就讓他們在外面瞎撞吧{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}So, let them fumble about outside and stay calm.{\r}

484
00:58:51,537 --> 00:58:53,164
{\fn幼圓}這只是一個開始{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}This is simply the beginning.{\r}

485
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:58,332
{\fn幼圓}我想我已經說過 要保持無線電靜默{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I told you all I wanted radio silence until...{\r}

486
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:01,072
{\fn幼圓}是嗎,我很抱歉,漢斯 我沒收到這條指令{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I'm very sorry, Hans. I didn't get that message.{\r}

487
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:04,547
{\fn幼圓}也許你應該貼在公告板上{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Maybe you should have put it on a bulletin board.{\r}

488
00:59:04,616 --> 00:59:07,141
{\fn幼圓}我想既然我幹掉了 托尼、馬可和他的朋友{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I figured since I waxed Tony and Marco and his friend here,{\r}

489
00:59:07,219 --> 00:59:10,052
{\fn幼圓}你和卡爾還有法蘭柯 也許會感到寂寞{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I figured you and Karl and Franco might be lonely{\r}

490
00:59:10,155 --> 00:59:12,089
{\fn幼圓}所以我想和你聊聊{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}so I wanted to give you a call.{\r}

491
00:59:12,191 --> 00:59:14,386
{\fn幼圓}他怎麼會知道這麼多?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}How does he know so much about us?{\r}

492
00:59:15,828 --> 00:59:17,955
{\fn幼圓}你真是一個好人{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}That's very kind of you.{\r}

493
00:59:18,397 --> 00:59:21,389
{\fn幼圓}我想你就是那位不速之客{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I assume you are our mysterious party crasher.{\r}

494
00:59:22,067 --> 00:59:23,432
{\fn幼圓}作為一名警衛{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}You are most troublesome{\r}

495
00:59:23,502 --> 00:59:25,629
{\fn幼圓}你可真是稱職{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}for a security guard.{\r}

496
00:59:26,505 --> 00:59:28,564
{\fn幼圓}抱歉,漢斯,你猜錯了{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Sorry, Hans. Wrong guess.{\r}

497
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:31,404
{\fn幼圓}要不要再猜一次,說不准還能得分{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Would you like to go for double jeopardy?{\r}

498
00:59:36,515 --> 00:59:38,915
{\fn幼圓}這對你的健康沒好處{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}These are very bad for you.{\r}

499
00:59:39,785 --> 00:59:41,275
{\fn幼圓}你到底是誰?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Who are you, then?{\r}

500
00:59:41,387 --> 00:59:43,651
{\fn幼圓}我只是一隻討厭的蒼蠅,漢斯{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Just the fly in the ointment, Hans.{\r}

501
00:59:43,722 --> 00:59:45,121
{\fn幼圓}一隻搗亂的猴子 喉嚨堛漱@根刺{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}The monkey in the wrench,{\r}

502
00:59:45,224 --> 00:59:47,192
{\fn幼圓}(塑膠炸彈){\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}the pain in the ass.{\r}

503
00:59:52,331 --> 00:59:54,799
{\fn幼圓}去查查別的人,別用對講機{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Check on all the others. Don't use the radio.{\r}

504
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:59,064
{\fn幼圓}看看馬可是不是真的死了 查出還有誰失聯{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}See if he's lying about Marco and find out if anyone else is missing.{\r}

505
01:00:02,674 --> 01:00:04,733
{\fn幼圓}不速之客先生?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Mr Mystery Guest,{\r}

506
01:00:05,878 --> 01:00:07,607
{\fn幼圓}你還在嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}are you still there?{\r}

507
01:00:08,347 --> 01:00:10,008
{\fn幼圓}對,我還在{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Yeah, I'm still here{\r}

508
01:00:10,082 --> 01:00:12,812
{\fn幼圓}你想打開大門迎接我嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}unless you want to open the front door for me.{\r}

509
01:00:12,918 --> 01:00:14,818
{\fn幼圓}哦,我想不會{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}No, I'm afraid not,{\r}

510
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:17,684
{\fn幼圓}你給我帶來了麻煩{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}but you have me at a loss.{\r}

511
01:00:17,756 --> 01:00:19,519
{\fn幼圓}你知道我的名字,但是你是誰?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}You know my name, but who are you?{\r}

512
01:00:19,625 --> 01:00:23,755
{\fn幼圓}你是不是小的時候電影看多了?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Just another American who saw too many movies as a child?{\r}

513
01:00:23,896 --> 01:00:27,059
{\fn幼圓}還是破產家庭的孤兒?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Another orphan of a bankrupt culture{\r}

514
01:00:27,132 --> 01:00:30,260
{\fn幼圓}自以為是大英雄? 藍波?狄龍警長?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}who thinks he's John Wayne, Rambo, Marshal Dillon?{\r}

515
01:00:31,537 --> 01:00:34,472
{\fn幼圓}其實我一直崇拜牛仔羅伊{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I was always partial to Roy Rogers, actually.{\r}

516
01:00:35,107 --> 01:00:36,836
{\fn幼圓}特別是那件亮閃閃的上衣{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I liked those sequined shirts.{\r}

517
01:00:36,942 --> 01:00:40,173
{\fn幼圓}你真的以為 能和我們對抗嗎,牛仔?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Do you really think you have a chance against us, Mr Cowboy?{\r}

518
01:00:43,315 --> 01:00:45,442
{\fn幼圓}等著瞧,混蛋{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker.{\r}

519
01:00:49,421 --> 01:00:51,514
{\fn幼圓}給我一部新聞車 我能勝過其他人!{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I'll beat everyone if I get a remote.{\r}

520
01:00:51,590 --> 01:00:53,387
{\fn幼圓}山姆,我還沒拿到新聞稿{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Sam, I don't have the new pages.{\r}

521
01:00:53,492 --> 01:00:55,722
{\fn幼圓}哈維,保持鎮靜,好嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Harvey, keep your pants on.{\r}

522
01:00:55,794 --> 01:00:57,557
{\fn幼圓}山姆,我求你了{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Sam, I'm begging you.{\r}

523
01:00:57,663 --> 01:01:00,860
{\fn幼圓}西蒙已經乘新聞車出去了 我讓他先去看看{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Simon's with the remote. I'll tell him to swing by.{\r}

524
01:01:00,966 --> 01:01:02,763
{\fn幼圓}我不想讓給西蒙!{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I won't sit on this!{\r}

525
01:01:02,868 --> 01:01:05,666
{\fn幼圓}這是我的新聞,我馬上就要去!{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}This is my story! I'm going out there!{\r}

526
01:01:05,737 --> 01:01:07,364
{\fn幼圓}好啦,聽著,山姆,我告訴你{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Look, Sam. Tell you what.{\r}

01:01:07,473 --> 01:01:09,668
{\fn幼圓}如果你不給我一輛車 我就去偷一輛{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}You don't give me a truck, I'll steal a truck.{\r}

528

529
01:01:12,277 --> 01:01:14,802
{\fn幼圓}-閉嘴,哈維! -四,三,二…{\r}

{\fn幼圓}一{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}one.{\r}

531
01:01:16,348 --> 01:01:18,111
{\fn幼圓}哈維,已經開始直播了{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Harvey, we're on the air.{\r}

532
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:24,480

536
01:01:44,109 --> 01:01:47,510
{\fn幼圓}他沒騙人,馬可躺在大街上{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}He wasn't lying about Marco. He's down on the street.{\r}

537
01:01:47,579 --> 01:01:49,843
{\fn幼圓}另一個是亨利{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}The other man was Heinrich{\r}

{\fn幼圓}那就別浪費時間和我說話{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Then don't waste time{\r}

545
01:02:11,603 --> 01:02:13,468
{\fn幼圓}我是洛杉磯警察局的鮑爾警官{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}talking to me.{\r}

546
01:02:14,106 --> 01:02:15,733
{\fn幼圓}如果那個報警的人{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}This is Sergeant Al Powell{\r}

547
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:18,935
{\fn幼圓}能收到這個頻道{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}of the LA Police Department. If the person who radioed for help{\r}

{\fn幼圓}我再說一遍{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I say again,{\r}

550
01:02:23,482 --> 01:02:26,815
{\fn幼圓}如果剛才報警的人能收到這個頻道{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}if the person who radioed for help can hear me,{\r}

551
01:02:26,885 --> 01:02:29,376
{\fn幼圓}請你馬上回話{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}acknowledge this transmission!{\r}

552
01:02:33,659 --> 01:02:36,287
{\fn幼圓}我聽到了 你就是開車的人?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I read you, pal. You the guy in the car?{\r}

553
01:02:36,395 --> 01:02:38,363
{\fn幼圓}那位差點完蛋的{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}What's left of him.{\r}

554
01:02:38,430 --> 01:02:40,057
{\fn幼圓}你能說明身份嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Can you identify yourself?{\r}

555
01:02:40,198 --> 01:02:41,859
{\fn幼圓}現在不行,以後再說{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Not now. Maybe later.{\r}

556
01:02:41,967 --> 01:02:46,028
{\fn幼圓}仔細聽著,頻道上有其他人 他們都喜歡扣扳機{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Listen fast. This is a party line. The neighbors got itchy trigger fingers.{\r}

557
01:02:46,171 --> 01:02:49,607
{\fn幼圓}情況如下 三十層有大約三十名人質{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Here's the deal. You got 30 or so hostages on the 30th floor.{\r}

558
01:02:49,708 --> 01:02:51,107
{\fn幼圓}匪徒的頭目叫漢斯{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}The leader's name is Hans.{\r}

559
01:02:51,243 --> 01:02:53,871
{\fn幼圓}我們得讓他閉嘴,他什麼都說了{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}We have to shut him up. He's telling them everything!{\r}

560
01:02:53,946 --> 01:02:56,039
{\fn幼圓}別管他,我正等著聯邦調查局{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Let him. I'm waiting for the FBI.{\r}

561
01:02:56,114 --> 01:02:58,241
{\fn幼圓}在那之前,隨便他浪費時間{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}He can waste as much time as he likes{\r}

562
01:02:58,317 --> 01:03:00,615
{\fn幼圓}不過我們得找到那個背包{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}but we must find the bag, Fritz.{\r}

563
01:03:00,686 --> 01:03:02,711

01:03:04,256 --> 01:03:08,886
{\fn幼圓}他們有導彈和自動武器{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}They got missiles and enough plastic explosives to orbit Arnold Schwarzenegger.{\r}

566
01:03:09,428 --> 01:03:12,261
{\fn幼圓}炸藥多到能把阿諾炸上天{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}They're down to nine, counting the skydiver you met.{\r}

567
01:03:12,331 --> 01:03:17,132
{\fn幼圓}他們現在還剩九個 算上剛才那位空中飛人{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}These guys are mostly European judging by their clothing labels and...{\r}

568
01:03:23,575 --> 01:03:25,099
{\fn幼圓}這些人大多數是歐洲人 從他們的服裝…{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}cigarettes.{\r}

569
01:03:25,243 --> 01:03:27,734
{\fn幼圓}…和香菸品牌看得出來{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}They're well-financed and very slick.{\r}

570
01:03:27,846 --> 01:03:29,507
{\fn幼圓}他們手頭富裕,非常專業{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}How do you know that?{\r}

571
01:03:29,581 --> 01:03:31,344
{\fn幼圓}你是怎麼知道這些的?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I've seen enough phony IDs in my time{\r}

572
01:03:31,450 --> 01:03:35,284
{\fn幼圓}我見過許多假證件{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}to recognize the ones they got must have cost a fortune.{\r}

573
01:03:37,556 --> 01:03:39,956
{\fn幼圓}他們的肯定花了不少錢{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Add all that up, I don't know what the fuck it means{\r}

574
01:03:40,058 --> 01:03:43,653
{\fn幼圓}總之,我不知道 這意味著什麼{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}but you got some bad-ass perpetrators and they're here to stay.{\r}

575
01:03:45,197 --> 01:03:48,132
{\fn幼圓}但是你們在這兒遇到的 都是職業高手{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I hear you, partner. LA's finest are on it,{\r}

576
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:50,168
{\fn幼圓}我明白了,老兄 洛杉磯警局的精銳就到了{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}so light 'em if you got 'em.{\r}

577
01:03:50,302 --> 01:03:53,066
{\fn幼圓}-有時間就抽幾支菸吧 -早就點上了,老兄{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Way ahead of you, partner.{\r}

578
01:03:53,605 --> 01:03:55,698
{\fn幼圓}我怎麼叫你?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}So what do I call you?{\r}

579
01:03:57,209 --> 01:03:58,369
{\fn幼圓}叫我…{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Call me...{\r}

580

{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Roy.{\r}

581
01:04:01,146 --> 01:04:04,912
{\fn幼圓}聽我說,羅伊 如果你漏了什麼,千萬別客氣{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Listen up, Roy, if you think of anything else{\r}

582
01:04:04,983 --> 01:04:06,143
{\fn幼圓}找一個安全的地方藏起來 其它的事我們來處理，清楚嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}don't be shy, OK?{\r}

583
01:04:06,218 --> 01:04:09,312
{\fn幼圓}交給你了,艾爾{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}In the meantime, find a safe place and let us do ourjob.{\r}

584
01:04:10,322 --> 01:04:12,586
{\fn幼圓}「一、二、三號鎖解除」{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}They're all yours, Al.{\r}

585
01:04:30,042 --> 01:04:31,373
{\fn幼圓}誰在和他們談判?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Who's talking to 'em?{\r}

586
01:04:32,411 --> 01:04:35,437
{\fn幼圓}是我,長官 鮑爾警官,艾爾．鮑爾{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I am, sir. Sergeant Powell. Al Powell.{\r}

587
01:04:35,914 --> 01:04:39,941
{\fn幼圓}杜恩．羅賓森,怎麼回事? 這些混蛋想要什麼?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Dwayne Robinson. What's the deal? What do these pricks want?{\r}

588
01:04:40,018 --> 01:04:42,145
{\fn幼圓}對那些恐怖分子,我們一無所知{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}If you mean the terrorists,{\r}

589
01:04:42,220 --> 01:04:44,245
{\fn幼圓}他們什麼也沒說{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}we haven't heard a peep from them.{\r}

590
01:04:44,389 --> 01:04:46,220
{\fn幼圓}那你剛才在和誰通話?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Who have you been talking to?{\r}

591
01:04:47,259 --> 01:04:50,160
{\fn幼圓}我也不清楚 他不想說他的名字{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}We don't know. He won't give us his name.{\r}

592
01:04:50,228 --> 01:04:52,856
{\fn幼圓}但應該就是報警的那個人{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}But he appears to be the one who phoned.{\r}

593
01:04:52,964 --> 01:04:56,195
{\fn幼圓}他殺了一名恐怖分子 而且他說還殺了另外兩個{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}He's killed one terrorist and claims he capped two others.{\r}

594
01:04:56,268 --> 01:04:57,530
{\fn幼圓}他說?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}He claims?{\r}

595
01:04:57,602 --> 01:04:59,797
{\fn幼圓}鮑爾,你有沒有想過…{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Powell, has it occurred to you{\r}

596
01:04:59,871 --> 01:05:02,237
{\fn幼圓}是恐怖分子假扮來騙你?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}he could be one of the terrorists{\r}

597
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:04,069
{\fn幼圓}或是什麼瘋子?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}or some nutcase in there?{\r}

598
01:05:04,176 --> 01:05:07,236
{\fn幼圓}我認為不是,長官 實際上我認為他是警察{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I don't think so. In fact, I think he's a cop,{\r}

599
01:05:07,345 --> 01:05:10,143
{\fn幼圓}也許不是洛杉磯的 但必是一名警察{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}maybe not LAPD, but he's definitely a badge.{\r}

600
01:05:10,215 --> 01:05:13,480
{\fn幼圓}-你怎麼知道? -直覺,還有他說的話{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}- How do you know that? - A hunch... things he said{\r}

601
01:05:13,585 --> 01:05:16,349
{\fn幼圓}比如他能分辨假證件{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}like being able to spot a phony ID.{\r}

602
01:05:16,455 --> 01:05:18,548
{\fn幼圓}天啊,鮑爾!{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Jesus Christ, Powell!{\r}

603
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:21,091
{\fn幼圓}連酒吧的招待都會做!{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}He could be a bartender for all we know!{\r}

604
01:05:21,193 --> 01:05:22,751
{\fn幼圓}記者來了{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}TV's here.{\r}

605
01:05:23,662 --> 01:05:25,254
{\fn幼圓}哦,該死{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Oh, shit.{\r}

606
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:43,770
{\fn幼圓}我有個要求{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I have a request.{\r}

607
01:05:43,849 --> 01:05:46,215
{\fn幼圓}哪個笨蛋讓你當老大?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}What idiot put you in charge?{\r}

608
01:05:46,284 --> 01:05:48,252
{\fn幼圓}就是你{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}You did{\r}

609
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:53,519
{\fn幼圓}你殺了我的老闆,現在我最大{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}when you murdered my boss. Now everybody's looking to me.{\r}

610
01:05:53,625 --> 01:05:58,722
{\fn幼圓}我並不想要這個責任 因為我不想這麼靠近你{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Personally, I'd pass on the job. I don't enjoy being this close to you.{\r}

611
01:06:06,705 --> 01:06:08,002
{\fn幼圓}說吧{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Go on.{\r}

612
01:06:08,106 --> 01:06:10,074
{\fn幼圓}外面有一位懷孕的婦女{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}We have a pregnant woman.{\r}

613
01:06:10,142 --> 01:06:13,077
{\fn幼圓}放心,她還有幾周才會生{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Relax. She's not due for a couple of weeks{\r}

614
01:06:13,145 --> 01:06:16,308
{\fn幼圓}但是坐在地板上對她的背不好{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}but sitting on that rock isn't doing her any good.{\r}

615
01:06:16,414 --> 01:06:20,714
{\fn幼圓}請你准許讓她到 辦公室的沙發上坐{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}So I would like permission to move her to an office with a sofa.{\r}

616
01:06:21,686 --> 01:06:24,621
{\fn幼圓}我們可以把沙發搬出來,不是嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}No, but I'll have a sofa brought out. Good enough?{\r}

617
01:06:24,689 --> 01:06:26,452
{\fn幼圓}很好{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Good enough.{\r}

618
01:06:26,558 --> 01:06:31,860
{\fn幼圓}如果你怕髒的話 最好開始讓我們分組去上廁所{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}And unless you like it messy, I'd start bringing us in groups to the bathroom.{\r}

619
01:06:32,297 --> 01:06:35,698
{\fn幼圓}對,你說的對 沒問題{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Yes. You're right. It will be done.{\r}

620
01:06:36,501 --> 01:06:37,627
{\fn幼圓}還有別的事嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Was there something else?{\r}

621
01:06:40,032 --> 01:06:42,023
{\fn幼圓}沒有,謝謝{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}No, thank you.{\r}

622
01:06:48,073 --> 01:06:51,736
{\fn幼圓}青木先生很會選人,你是…{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Mr Takagi chose his people well, Mrs?{\r}

623

{\fn幼圓}吉奈蘿小姐{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Ms Gennero.{\r}

625
01:06:59,785 --> 01:07:02,379

627
01:07:06,458 --> 01:07:11,725
{\fn幼圓}今晚,洛杉磯也成為…{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Tonight, Los Angeles has joined the sad and worldwide fraternity of cities{\r}

628
01:07:11,797 --> 01:07:13,788

{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}whose only membership requirement{\r}

629
01:07:13,899 --> 01:07:16,959
{\fn幼圓}全球城市之列{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}is to suffer the anguish of international terrorism.{\r}

630
01:07:17,069 --> 01:07:21,403
{\fn幼圓}大約兩個小時以前 一群身份不詳的恐怖分子{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Approximately two hours ago, an unidentified group of men{\r}

631
01:07:21,507 --> 01:07:26,501
{\fn幼圓}佔領了中富大廈 封鎖了所有入口和出口{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}seized control of the Nakatomi building, sealing off all entrances and exits.{\r}

632
01:07:26,612 --> 01:07:30,912
{\fn幼圓}電話線全部被切斷 現在唯一的通訊手段{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}All telephone lines have been cut and the only communication now possible{\r}

633
01:07:30,983 --> 01:07:33,918
{\fn幼圓}就是無線電對講機{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}has been through the use of CB communicators{\r}

634
01:07:33,986 --> 01:07:36,352
{\fn幼圓}顯然是由恐怖分子帶來的{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}which the group brought with them.{\r}

635
01:07:36,421 --> 01:07:40,949
{\fn幼圓}警方稱佔領這座大廈的暴徒…{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}According to official sources, the perpetrators of this building siege...{\r}

636
01:07:41,026 --> 01:07:43,756
{\fn幼圓}第五組,在主入口處待命{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Unit five, hold your position.{\r}

637
01:07:44,029 --> 01:07:48,090
{\fn幼圓}查理那一組在停車場…{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}We got Charlie unit in position by the parking structure.{\r}

638
01:07:48,167 --> 01:07:52,194
{\fn幼圓}我想問一下 這道樓梯是不是直通電梯?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Let me ask you... Does this stairway go up to the escalator?{\r}

639
01:07:52,304 --> 01:07:55,330
{\fn幼圓}-對 -告訴他們繼續{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}- Yeah. - Tell them to go ahead.{\r}

640
01:07:56,041 --> 01:07:57,736
{\fn幼圓}你們要幹什麼?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}What's going on?{\r}

641
01:07:58,443 --> 01:08:00,604
{\fn幼圓}你看呢?我們要衝進去{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}What's it look like? We're going in.{\r}

642
01:08:00,746 --> 01:08:05,547

{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Going in? That's crazy! There could be over 30 hostages in there for all we know.{\r}

643
01:08:05,617 --> 01:08:07,551
{\fn幼圓}我們什麼也不知道,鮑爾{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}We don't know shit, Powell.{\r}

644
01:08:07,619 --> 01:08:11,020
{\fn幼圓}如果有人質 為什麼不提出贖金的數目?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}If there's hostages, how come there are no ransom demands?{\r}

645
01:08:11,123 --> 01:08:14,388
{\fn幼圓}如果有恐怖分子 他們為什麼不提出要求?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}If there's terrorists in there, where's their list of demands?{\r}

646
01:08:14,459 --> 01:08:16,723
{\fn幼圓}我們只知道 有人向你的車開槍{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}All we know is that somebody shot your car up.{\r}

647
01:08:16,795 --> 01:08:18,956
{\fn幼圓}說不定就是{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}It's probably the same silly son of a bitch{\r}

648
01:08:19,031 --> 01:08:21,022
{\fn幼圓}剛才和你通話的蠢貨{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}you've been talking to on that radio.{\r}

649
01:08:21,133 --> 01:08:22,794
{\fn幼圓}對不起,長官!{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Excuse me, sir,{\r}

650
01:08:22,868 --> 01:08:26,167
{\fn幼圓}那具從天而降的屍體 又怎麼解釋?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}but what about the body that fell out the window?{\r}

651
01:08:26,238 --> 01:08:29,230
{\fn幼圓}-也許是破產的股票經紀人 -我們準備好了,局長{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}- Maybe a stockbroker got depressed. - We're ready.{\r}

652
01:08:29,341 --> 01:08:31,741

{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Powell?{\r}

655
01:08:48,994 --> 01:08:51,656
{\fn幼圓}艾爾,你還在嗎,夥計? 這是怎麼了?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Powell, you still with me, babe? What's goin' on?{\r}

656

{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}and when to pray.{\r}

663
01:09:08,647 --> 01:09:10,877

680
01:11:43,969 --> 01:11:46,164
{\fn幼圓}聖誕前夕，萬籟俱寂{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}'Twas the night before Christmas{\r}

681
01:11:46,238 --> 01:11:48,229
{\fn幼圓}屋內一片平靜，除了…{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}and all through the house{\r}

682
01:11:48,340 --> 01:11:50,774
{\fn幼圓}四個傢伙想從後面進來{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}not a creature was stirring, except{\r}

683
01:11:50,842 --> 01:11:53,811

{\fn幼圓}他們朝藍隊開槍!{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Take cover!{\r}

691
01:12:24,910 --> 01:12:26,434
{\fn幼圓}-亂開槍,他們什麼也看不見 -他們在射探照燈{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}They're shooting at 'em.{\r}

692
01:12:26,511 --> 01:12:30,504
{\fn幼圓}他們的目標是探照燈{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}- It's panic fire. They can't see anything. - They're shooting at the lights.{\r}

693
01:12:34,820 --> 01:12:38,381
{\fn幼圓}叫他們回來{\r}

694
01:12:39,324 --> 01:12:40,723
{\fn幼圓}這鎖打不開{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}It's not happening.{\r}

695
01:12:40,826 --> 01:12:42,020

{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Mike, burn it.{\r}

696
01:12:44,296 --> 01:12:45,991
{\fn幼圓}沉住氣{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Don't be impatient.{\r}

697
01:12:46,832 --> 01:12:48,629
{\fn幼圓}打傷就可以了{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Just wound them.{\r}

698
01:12:50,635 --> 01:12:53,195

{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Get them back. They're sitting ducks.{\r}

699
01:12:53,271 --> 01:12:55,034
{\fn幼圓}不,他們就要進去了{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}They're almost in.{\r}

700
01:12:55,107 --> 01:12:56,301
{\fn幼圓}讓裝甲車過來{\r}

01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:58,008
{\fn幼圓}讓裝甲車過來{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Send in the car.{\r}

{\fn幼圓}這個意見你接不接受,蠢貨{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Let's see you take this under advisement, jerkweed.{\r}

723
01:16:25,216 --> 01:16:27,116

726
01:16:53,878 --> 01:16:55,937
{\fn幼圓}蠢貨,不是警方干的{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}You idiot, it's not the police.{\r}

727
01:16:56,514 --> 01:16:58,243
{\fn幼圓}是他{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}It's him.{\r}

{\fn幼圓}天哪!{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}My God!{\r}

01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,969
{\fn幼圓}-告訴我你拍到了 -拍到了{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}- Tell me you got that. - I got it.{\r}

731

{\fn幼圓}有消息稱他們的領導,漢斯{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Sources say the terrorist leader, Hans,{\r}

734
01:17:29,180 --> 01:17:31,205
{\fn幼圓}也許就是漢斯．格魯伯{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}may be this man... Hans Gruber.{\r}

735
01:17:31,316 --> 01:17:34,217
{\fn幼圓}激進的西德人民陣線組織成員{\r}

736
01:17:34,319 --> 01:17:38,119
{\fn幼圓}奇怪的是 人民陣線領導人一小時前{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Strangely, the Volksfrei leadership issued a communique an hour ago{\r}

737
01:17:38,189 --> 01:17:40,987
{\fn幼圓}聲稱格魯伯 已被逐出該組織{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}stating that Gruber had been expelled from that organization.{\r}

738
01:17:41,092 --> 01:17:43,151

{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}What was that?{\r}

{\fn幼圓}-記得 -就是它,大廈起火了嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}There you go. Is the building on fire?{\r}

744
01:17:55,807 --> 01:17:57,570
{\fn幼圓}沒有,不過需要重新刷漆{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}No, but it's gonna need a paintjob{\r}

745
01:17:57,709 --> 01:17:59,301
{\fn幼圓}還要換許多玻璃門{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}and a shitload of screen doors.{\r}

746
01:17:59,377 --> 01:18:02,141
{\fn幼圓}觀察哨說 爆炸幹掉兩個{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Our spotter said you got two with that blast.{\r}

{\fn幼圓}-是他嗎? -是,長官{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}- Is that him? - Yes, sir.{\r}

748
01:18:06,384 --> 01:18:09,046
{\fn幼圓}現在你聽好了,先生 我不知道你想幹嘛{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I don't know who you think you are{\r}

749
01:18:09,154 --> 01:18:11,588
{\fn幼圓}但是你毀了一座大廈!{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}but you just destroyed a building.{\r}

750
01:18:11,723 --> 01:18:14,783

{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}We do not want your help. Is that clear?{\r}

751
01:18:14,859 --> 01:18:16,724
{\fn幼圓}我們不需要你的幫助{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}We don't want your help.{\r}

752
01:18:16,795 --> 01:18:19,855

{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Glass? Who gives a shit about glass?{\r}

{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}What does he want?{\r}

784
01:19:46,284 --> 01:19:49,947
{\fn幼圓}他想要什麼?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}It's not what I want. It's what I can give you.{\r}

785
01:19:57,362 --> 01:19:59,694

{\fn幼圓}聽著,我還是直說了吧{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}It's obvious you're not some dumb schmuck up here to snatch a few purses.{\r}

787
01:20:04,502 --> 01:20:06,129
{\fn幼圓}很明顯,你們到這來不只是 為了偷幾個小錢,對嗎?{\r}

793
01:20:17,849 --> 01:20:20,079

{\fn幼圓}也許你們對阿拉伯人不滿{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Maybe it's Northern Ireland. It's none of my business.{\r}

795
01:20:23,154 --> 01:20:25,486
{\fn幼圓}也許是以色列或是北愛 這不關我的事{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I figure you're here to negotiate, am I right?{\r}

796
01:20:25,557 --> 01:20:26,683

{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}You figured this all out already?{\r}

798

{\fn幼圓}你們用槍,我用筆 有什麼區別?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}You use a gun, I use a fountain pen. What's the difference?{\r}

800
01:20:34,732 --> 01:20:37,326
{\fn幼圓}我這樣說吧 你們的目的是錢{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}In my terms, you're here on a hostile takeover.{\r}

801
01:20:37,402 --> 01:20:41,998

854
01:23:38,750 --> 01:23:42,709

{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}They want the detonators, or they're gonna kill me.{\r}

855

866

{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}You're not part of this equation.{\r}

867
01:24:19,957 --> 01:24:22,221

868
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:25,659
{\fn幼圓}老兄,把槍拿開 這是對講機,不是電視{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Babe, put away the gun. This is radio, not television.{\r}

869
01:24:25,763 --> 01:24:29,392
{\fn幼圓}漢斯,這個混蛋不是我朋友! 我們剛碰面,我根本不認識他{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Hans, this asshole is not my friend! I don't know him!{\r}

872
01:24:37,074 --> 01:24:40,635

{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}He just let the guy die.{\r}

879
01:25:22,220 --> 01:25:24,245
{\fn幼圓}他不管他的死活 把對講機給我{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}He gave him up. Give me that headset.{\r}

880
01:25:24,322 --> 01:25:26,449
{\fn幼圓}這和親手扣扳機沒什麼兩樣{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}That's like pulling the trigger yourself.{\r}

881
01:25:26,524 --> 01:25:30,187
{\fn幼圓}難道你不知道是怎麼回事嗎? 難道你看不出來嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Can't you see what's happening? Can't you read between the lines?{\r}

882

883
01:25:32,663 --> 01:25:35,791
{\fn幼圓}如果他投降 那麼他倆都已經死了!{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}If he gave himself up, they'd both be dead right now!{\r}

884
01:25:35,867 --> 01:25:38,529
{\fn幼圓}不行,不行 他們要和我們談判{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}No way, man. They'd be talking to us.{\r}

885
01:25:38,636 --> 01:25:42,094
{\fn幼圓}聽著,告訴你那位夥伴 從現在開始別再插手,你聽見了嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}You tell this partner of yours to stay out of this from now on.{\r}

886
01:25:42,206 --> 01:25:45,733
{\fn幼圓}要是他不聽,我就要他好看 聽著,我會給他好看的{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Because if he doesn't, I'm really going to nail his ass.{\r}

890
01:25:55,419 --> 01:25:58,616

891
01:25:58,689 --> 01:26:01,624
{\fn幼圓}好好想想自己說的這些屁話{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Why don't you wake up and smell what you shovelin'?{\r}

01:35:22,048 --> 01:35:24,710
{\fn幼圓}我已經用光了所有炸藥{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I already used all the explosives.{\r}

1034
01:35:27,053 --> 01:35:28,384
{\fn幼圓}是嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Or did I?{\r}

1035
01:35:29,856 --> 01:35:31,448
{\fn幼圓}我只數到三{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I'm going to count to three.{\r}

1036
01:35:31,524 --> 01:35:33,992
{\fn幼圓}對了,就像對高木那樣?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Yeah. Like you did with Takagi?{\r}

1037
01:35:37,697 --> 01:35:39,028
{\fn幼圓}沒有子彈{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}No bullets.{\r}

1038
01:35:39,098 --> 01:35:42,192
{\fn幼圓}你以為我很蠢嗎,漢斯?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}What do you think... I'm fuckin' stupid, Hans?{\r}

1039
01:35:42,268 --> 01:35:43,292
{\fn幼圓}你說呢?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}You were saying?{\r}

1040
01:36:48,301 --> 01:36:50,201
{\fn幼圓}打碎玻璃{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Shoot the glass!{\r}

1041
01:37:23,569 --> 01:37:25,093
{\fn幼圓}王八蛋!{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Jesus Christ!{\r}

1042
01:37:54,333 --> 01:37:57,268
{\fn幼圓}笑吧,卡爾 我們又開張了{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Smile, Karl. We're back in business.{\r}

1043
01:37:59,972 --> 01:38:02,964
{\fn幼圓}…是外交的最後手段{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}...is the last resort of diplomacy,{\r}

1044
01:38:03,042 --> 01:38:06,068
{\fn幼圓}我們或許可以這麼說{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}then couldn't we just as well say{\r}

1045
01:38:06,179 --> 01:38:09,080
{\fn幼圓}恐怖主義也有同樣的效果{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}that terrorism has an equal claim on being that, too?{\r}

1046
01:38:09,782 --> 01:38:11,943
{\fn幼圓}告訴我你找到什麼了?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Tell me you got something.{\r}

1047
01:38:12,018 --> 01:38:15,977
{\fn幼圓}只有麥克連的名字、警徽號 任職記錄、基本數據{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}McClane's name, badge number, employment record, vital statistics,{\r}

1048
01:38:16,055 --> 01:38:18,546
{\fn幼圓}和他家人的地址{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}and his family's home address{\r}

1049
01:38:18,624 --> 01:38:20,057
{\fn幼圓}就在洛杉磯這喎\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}right here in LA.{\r}

1050
01:38:28,267 --> 01:38:29,427
{\fn幼圓}去工作{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Go to work.{\r}

1051
01:38:29,635 --> 01:38:31,432
{\fn幼圓}明白{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Got it.{\r}

1052
01:38:43,583 --> 01:38:46,814
{\fn幼圓}天哪,那個人好像真的很生氣{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}God, that man looks really pissed.{\r}

1053
01:38:49,188 --> 01:38:51,179
{\fn幼圓}他還活著{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}He's still alive.{\r}

1054
01:38:51,524 --> 01:38:52,582
{\fn幼圓}什麼?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}What?{\r}

1055
01:38:52,892 --> 01:38:56,828
{\fn幼圓}只有約翰才能把人逼成那樣{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Only John can drive somebody that crazy.{\r}

1056
01:39:13,710 --> 01:39:18,044
{\fn幼圓}漢斯,快帶你的奇?來 我們剛打開第六道{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Hans, heat up that miracle because we just broke through on number six{\r}

1057
01:39:18,114 --> 01:39:20,810
{\fn幼圓}電磁密封突然就啟動了{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}and the electromagnetic came down like an anvil.{\r}

1058
01:39:20,884 --> 01:39:26,254
{\fn幼圓}很好,先看看窗外的朋友 在幹什麼,我馬上就到{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Have a look at what our friends outside are doing and I'll be right up.{\r}

1059
01:39:28,658 --> 01:39:29,818
{\fn幼圓}嘿,約翰{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Hey, John.{\r}

1060
01:39:29,893 --> 01:39:32,327
{\fn幼圓}約翰．麥克連,你還在嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}John McClane, you still with us?{\r}

1061
01:39:32,429 --> 01:39:33,521
{\fn幼圓}在{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Yeah.{\r}

1062
01:39:34,331 --> 01:39:38,165
{\fn幼圓}不過要是讓我選 我寧願到費城去{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}But all things being equal, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.{\r}

1063
01:39:38,735 --> 01:39:40,862
{\fn幼圓}又幹掉兩個壞蛋{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Chalk up two more bad guys.{\r}

1064
01:39:41,238 --> 01:39:44,298
{\fn幼圓}很高興聽到這消息{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}The boys down here will be glad to hear that.{\r}

1065
01:39:44,875 --> 01:39:46,740
{\fn幼圓}知道嗎,我們都在你身上下了注{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}We got a pool going on you.{\r}

1066
01:39:46,843 --> 01:39:48,708
{\fn幼圓}我現在的賠率是多少?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}What kind of odds am I getting?{\r}

1067
01:39:48,778 --> 01:39:50,473
{\fn幼圓}你最好別知道{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}You don't want to know.{\r}

1068
01:39:50,547 --> 01:39:51,946
{\fn幼圓}幫我下20塊{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Put me down for 20.{\r}

1069
01:39:52,082 --> 01:39:53,242
{\fn幼圓}我賠得起{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I'm good for it.{\r}

1070
01:39:57,153 --> 01:39:59,781
{\fn幼圓}嘿,鮑爾,你是平足嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Hey, pal, you got flat feet?{\r}

1071
01:40:02,325 --> 01:40:04,520
{\fn幼圓}你這是什麼意思,夥計?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}What the hell you talking about, man?{\r}

1072
01:40:04,594 --> 01:40:06,994
{\fn幼圓}你為什麼不干巡警了?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Something had to get you off the street.{\r}

1073
01:40:07,130 --> 01:40:08,324
{\fn幼圓}這有什麼?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}What's the matter?{\r}

1074
01:40:08,398 --> 01:40:11,663
{\fn幼圓}你認為在辦公桌後面 整理文件就不是警察了嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}You don't think a desk job is a noble effort for a cop?{\r}

1075
01:40:13,570 --> 01:40:14,798
{\fn幼圓}不{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}No.{\r}

1076
01:40:18,308 --> 01:40:20,333
{\fn幼圓}我出過一次意外{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I had an accident.{\r}

1077
01:40:20,410 --> 01:40:22,708
{\fn幼圓}像你那樣開車肯定得出事{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}The way you drive, I can see why.{\r}

1078
01:40:22,779 --> 01:40:23,541
{\fn幼圓}是什麼事故?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}What'd you do?{\r}

1079
01:40:23,613 --> 01:40:26,207
{\fn幼圓}開車軋了隊長的腳嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Run over your captain's foot with the car?{\r}

1080
01:40:30,086 --> 01:40:31,314
{\fn幼圓}我殺了一個孩子{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I shot a kid.{\r}

1081
01:40:32,889 --> 01:40:34,720
{\fn幼圓}他當時只有13歲{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}He was 13 years old.{\r}

1082
01:40:35,959 --> 01:40:39,986
{\fn幼圓}天很黑,我看不清楚 他拿著逼真的玩具槍{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Oh, it was dark. I couldn't see him. He had a ray gun, looked real enough.{\r}

1083
01:40:43,300 --> 01:40:46,633
{\fn幼圓}警察學校 把你從菜鳥教成老手{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}When you're a rookie, they teach you everything about being a cop{\r}

1084
01:40:46,703 --> 01:40:48,967
{\fn幼圓}卻沒教你怎麼背下責任{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}except how to live with a mistake.{\r}

1085
01:40:52,976 --> 01:40:57,777
{\fn幼圓}總之,我再也無法 用槍指著任何人了{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Anyway, I just couldn't bring myself to draw my gun on anybody again.{\r}

1086
01:41:00,817 --> 01:41:02,182
{\fn幼圓}抱歉,夥計{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Sorry, man.{\r}

1087
01:41:03,653 --> 01:41:06,383
{\fn幼圓}嘿,夥計,你能體會嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Hey, man, how could you know?{\r}

1088
01:41:08,725 --> 01:41:10,556
{\fn幼圓}我現在感覺很糟{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I feel like shit anyway.{\r}

1089
01:41:13,563 --> 01:41:15,121
{\fn幼圓}那我還是告訴你吧{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Well, this won't matter.{\r}

1090
01:41:15,231 --> 01:41:19,964
{\fn幼圓}現在不是洛杉磯警察掌舵了{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}DoThe LAPD is not calling the shots down here anymore.{\r}

1091
01:41:22,439 --> 01:41:23,599
{\fn幼圓}調查局?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}The Feds?{\r}

1092
01:41:24,140 --> 01:41:25,232
{\fn幼圓}你說對了{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}You got it.{\r}

1093
01:41:27,878 --> 01:41:30,073
{\fn幼圓}你看,這些是市政工程師{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Those are the city engineers.{\r}

1094
01:41:30,347 --> 01:41:31,041
{\fn幼圓}等等{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Wait.{\r}

1095
01:41:31,882 --> 01:41:34,612
{\fn幼圓}他們在查看街道電路{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}They're going into the street circuits.{\r}

1096
01:41:34,684 --> 01:41:36,879
{\fn幼圓}看那些穿西裝的傢伙 不知是幹什麼的{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}The guys in suits, I don't know who they are.{\r}

1097
01:41:36,987 --> 01:41:38,750
{\fn幼圓}那就是調查局的{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}That's the FBI.{\r}

1098
01:41:38,822 --> 01:41:42,417
{\fn幼圓}他們依照程序 下令切斷大廈的電源{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}They're ordering the others to cut the building's power.{\r}

1099
01:41:42,492 --> 01:41:44,483
{\fn幼圓}像發條一樣規律{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Regular as clockwork.{\r}

1100
01:41:46,363 --> 01:41:47,887
{\fn幼圓}就像一把鑰匙{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Or a time lock.{\r}

1101
01:41:48,431 --> 01:41:50,160
{\fn幼圓}正確{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Precisely.{\r}

1102
01:41:50,267 --> 01:41:54,067
{\fn幼圓}為了對抗一起恐怖活動…{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}The circuits that cannot be cut are cut automatically{\r}

1103
01:41:54,170 --> 01:41:56,900
{\fn幼圓}無法切斷的電路 於是被迫切斷了{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}in response to a terrorist incident.{\r}

1104
01:41:57,007 --> 01:41:58,474
{\fn幼圓}想要奇?,西奧 就去找…{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}You asked for miracles, Theo.{\r}

1105
01:41:59,209 --> 01:42:02,474
{\fn幼圓}聯邦調查局{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I give you the F-B-I.{\r}

1106
01:42:04,481 --> 01:42:05,413
{\fn幼圓}-我要你切斷這座大廈的電源! -嘿,我這兒有點問題{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I want the building shut down.{\r}

1107
01:42:05,482 --> 01:42:07,643
{\fn幼圓}我不管你有什麼樣的問題! 必須關閉這個開關{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I got a problem. I got a switch...{\r}

1108
01:42:07,717 --> 01:42:11,710
{\fn幼圓}不能從這兒切斷{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I don't care about your switch. I want it out. Dark!{\r}

1109
01:42:12,689 --> 01:42:14,213
{\fn幼圓}-可以 -不能從這兒切斷!{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}You can't do it from here.{\r}

1110
01:42:14,324 --> 01:42:16,724
{\fn幼圓}我們可以…我有對講機{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}- Yeah, you could. - It can't be done from here.{\r}

1111
01:42:16,826 --> 01:42:18,487
{\fn幼圓}不能從這兒切斷電源 只能從市中心切斷{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I could... I got the radio...{\r}

1112
01:42:18,595 --> 01:42:22,053
{\fn幼圓}整個電網都會斷電{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}You can't do it from here. It's got to be done from downtown.{\r}

1113
01:42:22,132 --> 01:42:26,000
{\fn幼圓}這關係到十個街區{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}They've gotta take out a whole city grid. We're talking 10 square blocks.{\r}

1114
01:42:26,069 --> 01:42:27,900
{\fn幼圓}十個街區? 天哪,強森,你瘋了嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Ten blocks? Johnson, that's crazy.{\r}

1115
01:42:28,004 --> 01:42:30,598
{\fn幼圓}今天是聖誕夜,成千上萬的人…{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}It's Christmas Eve. There's thousands of people.{\r}

1116
01:42:30,674 --> 01:42:32,335
{\fn幼圓}我們必須這樣做!{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}You have to go wider.{\r}

1117
01:42:32,442 --> 01:42:37,505
{\fn幼圓}-我需要授權! -美國政府授權還不夠嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}- I need authorization. - How about the United States government?{\r}

1118
01:42:37,614 --> 01:42:39,673
{\fn幼圓}切斷電網,要麼丟掉飯碗{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Lose the grid, or you lose yourjob.{\r}

1119
01:42:45,855 --> 01:42:47,652
{\fn幼圓}中心嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Yeah, Central?{\r}

1120
01:42:47,724 --> 01:42:50,056
{\fn幼圓}我是沃爾特,在中富大廈{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}This is Walt, down at Nakatomi.{\r}

1121
01:42:50,126 --> 01:42:55,063
{\fn幼圓}聽著 你幫我切斷212電網好嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Would it be possible for you to turn off grid 212?{\r}

1122
01:42:55,131 --> 01:42:56,257
{\fn幼圓}你瘋了嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Are you crazy?!{\r}

1123
01:42:56,366 --> 01:42:59,028
{\fn幼圓}也許我該給市長打個電話{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Maybe I should call the mayor.{\r}

1124
01:42:59,102 --> 01:43:02,162
{\fn幼圓}倒霉的是我,我這兒麻煩大了 快關掉{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}No shit it's my ass. I got a big problem here.{\r}

1125
01:43:02,272 --> 01:43:04,672
{\fn幼圓}切斷電源,馬上!{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Shut it down now.{\r}

1126

{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Ask the FBI.{\r}

1129
01:43:15,318 --> 01:43:18,082
{\fn幼圓}他們正拿著反恐怖指南{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}They got the universal terrorist playbook{\r}

1130
01:43:18,154 --> 01:43:19,621

{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}and they're running it step by step.{\r}

1131
01:43:22,726 --> 01:43:24,660

01:43:53,723 --> 01:43:56,886
{\fn幼圓}那幫雜種可能已經尿了褲子了{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}They must be pissing in their pants.{\r}

1135
01:43:56,960 --> 01:43:58,825
{\fn幼圓}市長會殺了我{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}The mayor is gonna have my ass.{\r}

1136
01:44:20,150 --> 01:44:22,380
{\fn幼圓}現在我們該怎麼辦?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}What are we gonna do now?{\r}

1137
01:44:22,452 --> 01:44:25,444
{\fn幼圓}因為拒付電費逮捕他們嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Arrest them for not paying their electric bill?{\r}

1138
01:44:25,588 --> 01:44:27,351
{\fn幼圓}把他們關在堶惋\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}We've shut them down.{\r}

1139
01:44:27,424 --> 01:44:30,860
{\fn幼圓}讓他們流點冷汗 然後給他們直昇機{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}We let them sweat for a while, then we give them helicopters.{\r}

1140
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:33,155
{\fn幼圓}一個不留{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Right up the ass.{\r}

1141
01:44:35,765 --> 01:44:37,255

{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I want that air support ready to lift off in five minutes.{\r}

1144
01:44:42,205 --> 01:44:45,663

{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Damn right. Fully armed. We're on the way.{\r}

1145

{\fn幼圓}耶!{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Oh, yes!{\r}

1146

{\fn幼圓}我要和聯邦調查局的人談{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I wish to talk to the FBI.{\r}

1147
01:45:00,223 --> 01:45:02,350
{\fn幼圓}我是特別探員強森{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}This is Special Agent Johnson.{\r}

1148
01:45:02,425 --> 01:45:06,885

{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}The State Department has arranged for the return of your comrades.{\r}

1149
01:45:06,996 --> 01:45:09,624

{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Helicopters are en route as you requested.{\r}

1150
01:45:09,699 --> 01:45:11,963

{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I hear you. We'll be ready.{\r}

1151
01:45:12,035 --> 01:45:14,435
{\fn幼圓}等他知道上當的時候 已經在屍袋堣F{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}When he figures out what hit him, he'll be in a body bag.{\r}

1152
01:45:15,271 --> 01:45:18,172
{\fn幼圓}他們一著陸,我們就炸了樓頂{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}When they touch down, we'll blow the roof.{\r}

1153
01:45:18,241 --> 01:45:23,474
{\fn幼圓}等他們查出原因 我們已經在海灘上吃紅利了{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}By the time they figure it all out, we'll be sitting on a beach earning 20%.{\r}

1154
01:45:29,469 --> 01:45:30,959
{\fn幼圓}哦,媽的!{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Ah! Jeez!{\r}

1155

{\fn幼圓}鮑爾?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Powell?{\r}

1156
01:45:32,939 --> 01:45:34,770
{\fn幼圓}嘿,鮑爾,你有空嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Yo, Powell, you got a minute?{\r}

1157
01:45:36,509 --> 01:45:38,204
{\fn幼圓}我在這兒,約翰{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I'm here, John.{\r}

1158
01:45:39,946 --> 01:45:43,473
{\fn幼圓}聽著,夥計,我現在有一種 不祥的感覺{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Listen, I'm starting to get a bad feeling up here.{\r}

1159
01:45:43,550 --> 01:45:45,518
{\fn幼圓}我想請你幫我一個忙{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I want you to do something for me.{\r}

1160

{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I want you to find my wife. Don't ask me how. By then you'll know how.{\r}

{\fn幼圓}請你幫我轉告她 我想請你告訴她…{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I want you to tell her something. I want you to tell her that...{\r}

1162
01:46:06,005 --> 01:46:08,633
{\fn幼圓}告訴她我現在才知道{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Tell her it took me a while to figure out{\r}

1163
01:46:08,742 --> 01:46:10,835
{\fn幼圓}我真是個混蛋{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}what ajerk I've been{\r}

1164
01:46:11,411 --> 01:46:12,639
{\fn幼圓}不過{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}but...{\r}

1165
01:46:14,347 --> 01:46:15,336
{\fn幼圓}在她…{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}that...{\r}

1166
01:46:19,219 --> 01:46:21,949
{\fn幼圓}在她獲得大好機會的時候{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}that when things started to pan out for her{\r}

1167
01:46:22,021 --> 01:46:26,048
{\fn幼圓}我本應該去支持她{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I shoulda... been more supportive.{\r}

1168
01:46:26,526 --> 01:46:27,390
{\fn幼圓}而且…{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}And...{\r}

1169
01:46:28,928 --> 01:46:32,056
{\fn幼圓}讓她無後顧之憂{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I just should have been behind her more.{\r}

1170
01:46:34,601 --> 01:46:35,863
{\fn幼圓}哦,媽的{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Oh, shit.{\r}

1171
01:46:38,538 --> 01:46:40,597
{\fn幼圓}你告訴她{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Tell her that...{\r}

1172
01:46:41,541 --> 01:46:46,137
{\fn幼圓}對我這樣的流浪漢 她簡直就是一種恩賜{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}that she's the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me.{\r}

1173
01:46:48,047 --> 01:46:51,483
{\fn幼圓}她曾聽我說過一千遍 「我愛你」{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}She's heard me say "I love you" a thousand times.{\r}

1174
01:46:52,652 --> 01:46:56,088
{\fn幼圓}卻從未聽我說「對不起」{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}She never heard me say "I'm sorry".{\r}

1175
01:46:56,689 --> 01:47:02,958
{\fn幼圓}我希望你幫我告訴她 約翰說對不起{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I want you to tell her that, Al. Tell her that John said that he was sorry.{\r}

1176
01:47:04,297 --> 01:47:05,355

{\fn幼圓}你聽見了嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}You got that, man?{\r}

1178
01:47:07,567 --> 01:47:09,831
{\fn幼圓}是,我聽見了,約翰{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Yeah, I got it, John.{\r}

1179
01:47:11,171 --> 01:47:13,639
{\fn幼圓}你可以自己去跟她說{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}But you can tell her that yourself.{\r}

1180
01:47:14,073 --> 01:47:18,169
{\fn幼圓}只要你小心 肯定能活著出來,你明白嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}You just watch your ass and you'll make it out. You hear me?{\r}

1181
01:47:18,244 --> 01:47:20,610
{\fn幼圓}哦,我想這得問問樓上的人{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I guess that's up to the man upstairs.{\r}

1182
01:47:24,017 --> 01:47:25,484
{\fn幼圓}約翰?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}John?{\r}

1183
01:47:26,319 --> 01:47:27,786
{\fn幼圓}約翰?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}John?{\r}

1184
01:47:28,254 --> 01:47:31,781
{\fn幼圓}你在樓上搞什麼鬼,漢斯?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}What the fuck were you doing upstairs, Hans?{\r}

1185
01:47:33,426 --> 01:47:34,450
{\fn幼圓}約翰!{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}John?{\r}

1186
01:47:34,527 --> 01:47:37,655
{\fn幼圓}哦,艾爾,聽著 過會兒再和你聊{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}No, Al, listen. Just lay off for a while.{\r}

1187
01:47:39,666 --> 01:47:42,430
{\fn幼圓}我現在得去查看一下{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I gotta go check on something.{\r}

1188
01:47:45,205 --> 01:47:47,696
{\fn幼圓}一分鐘!我只要一分鐘{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}One minute, that's all I'm asking.{\r}

1189
01:47:47,807 --> 01:47:49,672
{\fn幼圓}我只和他們談一分鐘{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}One minute to speak to them.{\r}

1190
01:47:49,742 --> 01:47:51,801
{\fn幼圓}好吧,不許生人進來{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}All right. Get back. Get back.{\r}

1191
01:47:51,878 --> 01:47:54,278
{\fn幼圓}好吧,退後,走!走!{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}All right, look.{\r}

1192
01:47:54,347 --> 01:47:58,511
{\fn幼圓}聽著,你讓我進去 否則我就找移民局{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}You let me in right now, or I call the INS, comprende?{\r}

1193
01:48:01,120 --> 01:48:06,251
{\fn幼圓}這也許是孩子們最後一次 和他們的父母說話{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}This is the last time these kids are gonna have to speak to their parents.{\r}

1194
01:48:07,327 --> 01:48:08,453

{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}What were you doin', Hans?{\r}

1197
01:48:23,176 --> 01:48:24,666
{\fn幼圓}你在幹什麼?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}What were you doin'?{\r}

1198
01:48:47,267 --> 01:48:50,464

{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}The roof is wired to...{\r}

1201
01:49:00,914 --> 01:49:01,938

1205
01:49:09,222 --> 01:49:12,214
{\fn幼圓}好像是什麼圈套{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Something about a double cross.{\r}

1206
01:49:12,325 --> 01:49:14,623
{\fn幼圓}這還用你說{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Tell me about it.{\r}

{\fn幼圓}我們都是高手{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}We are both professionals.{\r}

1208
01:49:24,704 --> 01:49:26,365
{\fn幼圓}這是私人恩怨{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}This is personal.{\r}

1209
01:49:50,096 --> 01:49:52,394

{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Is there something you'd like to say to them, if they're watching?{\r}

1215

1315
02:04:58,704 --> 02:05:00,433
{\fn幼圓}這是我太太,荷莉{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Al, this is my wife Holly.{\r}

1316
02:05:00,505 --> 02:05:02,439
{\fn幼圓}荷莉．吉奈蘿{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Holly Gennero.{\r}

{\fn幼圓}荷莉．麥克連{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Holly McClane.{\r}

1318
02:05:05,043 --> 02:05:06,704
{\fn幼圓}你好,荷莉{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Hello, Holly.{\r}

1319
02:05:06,812 --> 02:05:08,746
{\fn幼圓}你選了一個好丈夫{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}You got yourself a good man.{\r}

1320
02:05:08,847 --> 02:05:10,838
{\fn幼圓}你要好好照顧他{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}You take good care of him.{\r}

1321
02:05:11,483 --> 02:05:12,973
{\fn幼圓}麥克連{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}McClane!{\r}

1322
02:05:13,252 --> 02:05:15,812
{\fn幼圓}麥克連,我要聽你的解釋! 我要你的解釋!{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}McClane, I want a debriefing!{\r}

1323
02:05:15,888 --> 02:05:18,516
{\fn幼圓}你必須回答一些問題,先生{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}You got some things to answer for, mister.{\r}

1324
02:05:18,657 --> 02:05:20,352
{\fn幼圓}殺死艾利斯是一件{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Ellis' murder, for one thing.{\r}

1325
02:05:20,459 --> 02:05:24,225
{\fn幼圓}財產損失、妨礙警方公務{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Property damage, interfering with police business.{\r}

1326
02:06:04,569 --> 02:06:07,663
{\fn幼圓}沒事啦!你們兩個進去看看 還有沒有別的人{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Two of you go inside and see if there's anybody else!{\r}

1327
02:06:18,417 --> 02:06:21,011
{\fn幼圓}哦,這是自己人!{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}No. This one's with me.{\r}

1328
02:06:30,963 --> 02:06:32,555
{\fn幼圓}麥克連先生,麥克連先生!{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Mr McClane, Mr McClane!{\r}

1329
02:06:32,631 --> 02:06:37,227
{\fn幼圓}一切都結束了,經過這些折磨 你有什麼感想?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Now that it's all over, after this incredible ordeal, what are your feelings?{\r}

1330
02:06:42,507 --> 02:06:43,940
{\fn幼圓}看誰來了{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Well, well, well.{\r}

1331
02:06:45,010 --> 02:06:48,241
{\fn幼圓}-聖誕快樂,阿蓋 -聖誕快樂{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}- Merry Christmas, Argyle. - Merry Christmas.{\r}

1332
02:06:51,817 --> 02:06:52,841
{\fn幼圓}你拍下來了?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Did you get that?{\r}

1333
02:06:55,420 --> 02:06:58,981
{\fn幼圓}如果這就是他們的聖誕節 我明年一定還來{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}If this is their idea of Christmas, I gotta be here for New Year's.{\r}

1334
02:07:19,750 --> 02:07:24,750
{\fn幼圓}謝謝觀賞{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}{\r}

1335
02:12:08,400 --> 02:12:10,391
{\fn幼圓}劇終{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}US ENGLISH{\r}

1336
02:12:11,391 --> 02:12:13,222
{\fn幼圓}那你剛才在和誰通話?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Who have you been talking to?{\r}

1337
02:12:14,261 --> 02:12:17,162
{\fn幼圓}我也不清楚 他不想說他的名字{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}We don't know. He won't give us his name.{\r}

1338
02:12:17,230 --> 02:12:19,858
{\fn幼圓}但應該就是報警的那個人{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}But he appears to be the one who phoned.{\r}

1339
02:12:19,966 --> 02:12:23,197
{\fn幼圓}他殺了一名恐怖分子 而且他說還殺了另外兩個{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}He's killed one terrorist and claims he capped two others.{\r}

1340
02:12:23,270 --> 02:12:24,532
{\fn幼圓}他說?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}He claims?{\r}

1341
02:12:24,604 --> 02:12:26,799
{\fn幼圓}鮑爾,你有沒有想過…{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Powell, has it occurred to you{\r}

1342
02:12:26,873 --> 02:12:29,239
{\fn幼圓}是恐怖分子假扮來騙你?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}he could be one of the terrorists{\r}

1343
02:12:29,342 --> 02:12:31,071
{\fn幼圓}或是什麼瘋子?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}or some nutcase in there?{\r}

1344
02:12:31,178 --> 02:12:34,238
{\fn幼圓}我認為不是,長官 實際上我認為他是警察{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I don't think so. In fact, I think he's a cop,{\r}

1345
02:12:34,347 --> 02:12:37,145
{\fn幼圓}也許不是洛杉磯的 但必是一名警察{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}maybe not LAPD, but he's definitely a badge.{\r}

1346
02:12:37,217 --> 02:12:40,482
{\fn幼圓}-你怎麼知道? -直覺,還有他說的話{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}- How do you know that? - A hunch... things he said{\r}

1347
02:12:40,587 --> 02:12:43,351
{\fn幼圓}比如他能分辨假證件{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}like being able to spot a phony ID.{\r}

1348
02:12:43,457 --> 02:12:45,550
{\fn幼圓}天啊,鮑爾!{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Jesus Christ, Powell!{\r}

1349
02:12:45,625 --> 02:12:48,093
{\fn幼圓}連酒吧的招待都會做!{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}He could be a bartender for all we know!{\r}

1350
02:12:48,195 --> 02:12:49,753
{\fn幼圓}記者來了{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}TV's here.{\r}

1351
02:12:50,664 --> 02:12:52,256
{\fn幼圓}哦,該死{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Oh, shit.{\r}

1352
02:13:09,282 --> 02:13:10,772
{\fn幼圓}我有個要求{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I have a request.{\r}

1353
02:13:10,851 --> 02:13:13,217
{\fn幼圓}哪個笨蛋讓你當老大?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}What idiot put you in charge?{\r}

1354
02:13:13,286 --> 02:13:15,254
{\fn幼圓}就是你{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}You did{\r}

1355
02:13:15,322 --> 02:13:20,521
{\fn幼圓}你殺了我的老闆,現在我最大{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}when you murdered my boss. Now everybody's looking to me.{\r}

1356
02:13:20,627 --> 02:13:25,724
{\fn幼圓}我並不想要這個責任 因為我不想這麼靠近你{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Personally, I'd pass on the job. I don't enjoy being this close to you.{\r}

1357
02:13:33,707 --> 02:13:35,004
{\fn幼圓}說吧{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Go on.{\r}

1358
02:13:35,108 --> 02:13:37,076
{\fn幼圓}外面有一位懷孕的婦女{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}We have a pregnant woman.{\r}

1359
02:13:37,144 --> 02:13:40,079
{\fn幼圓}放心,她還有幾周才會生{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Relax. She's not due for a couple of weeks{\r}

1360
02:13:40,147 --> 02:13:43,310
{\fn幼圓}但是坐在地板上對她的背不好{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}but sitting on that rock isn't doing her any good.{\r}

1361
02:13:43,416 --> 02:13:47,716
{\fn幼圓}請你准許讓她到 辦公室的沙發上坐{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}So I would like permission to move her to an office with a sofa.{\r}

1362
02:13:48,688 --> 02:13:51,623
{\fn幼圓}我們可以把沙發搬出來,不是嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}No, but I'll have a sofa brought out. Good enough?{\r}

1363
02:13:51,691 --> 02:13:53,454
{\fn幼圓}很好{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Good enough.{\r}

1364
02:13:53,560 --> 02:13:58,862
{\fn幼圓}如果你怕髒的話 最好開始讓我們分組去上廁所{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}And unless you like it messy, I'd start bringing us in groups to the bathroom.{\r}

1365
02:13:59,299 --> 02:14:02,700
{\fn幼圓}對,你說的對 沒問題{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Yes. You're right. It will be done.{\r}

1366
02:14:03,503 --> 02:14:04,629
{\fn幼圓}還有別的事嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Was there something else?{\r}

1367
02:14:07,034 --> 02:14:09,025
{\fn幼圓}沒有,謝謝{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}No, thank you.{\r}

1368
02:14:15,075 --> 02:14:18,738
{\fn幼圓}青木先生很會選人,你是…{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Mr Takagi chose his people well, Mrs?{\r}

1369
02:14:18,846 --> 02:14:20,905
{\fn幼圓}吉奈蘿{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Gennero.{\r}

1370
02:14:21,849 --> 02:14:24,147
{\fn幼圓}吉奈蘿小姐{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Ms Gennero.{\r}

1371
02:14:26,787 --> 02:14:29,381
{\fn幼圓}我們中斷節目 播出特別新聞報導{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}We interrupt this program for a special bulletin.{\r}

1372
02:14:29,490 --> 02:14:32,982
{\fn幼圓}理查．索伯在世紀城 為您現場報導{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}This is Richard Thornburg live from Century City.{\r}

1373
02:14:33,460 --> 02:14:38,727
{\fn幼圓}今晚,洛杉磯也成為…{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Tonight, Los Angeles has joined the sad and worldwide fraternity of cities{\r}

1374
02:14:38,799 --> 02:14:40,790
{\fn幼圓}遭受國際恐怖分子威脅的{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}whose only membership requirement{\r}

1375
02:14:40,901 --> 02:14:43,961
{\fn幼圓}全球城市之列{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}is to suffer the anguish of international terrorism.{\r}

1376
02:14:44,071 --> 02:14:48,405
{\fn幼圓}大約兩個小時以前 一群身份不詳的恐怖分子{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Approximately two hours ago, an unidentified group of men{\r}

1377
02:14:48,509 --> 02:14:53,503
{\fn幼圓}佔領了中富大廈 封鎖了所有入口和出口{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}seized control of the Nakatomi building, sealing off all entrances and exits.{\r}

1378
02:14:53,614 --> 02:14:57,914
{\fn幼圓}電話線全部被切斷 現在唯一的通訊手段{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}All telephone lines have been cut and the only communication now possible{\r}

1379
02:14:57,985 --> 02:15:00,920
{\fn幼圓}就是無線電對講機{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}has been through the use of CB communicators{\r}

1380
02:15:00,988 --> 02:15:03,354
{\fn幼圓}顯然是由恐怖分子帶來的{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}which the group brought with them.{\r}

1381
02:15:03,423 --> 02:15:07,951
{\fn幼圓}警方稱佔領這座大廈的暴徒…{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}According to official sources, the perpetrators of this building siege...{\r}

1382
02:15:08,028 --> 02:15:10,758
{\fn幼圓}第五組,在主入口處待命{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Unit five, hold your position.{\r}

1383
02:15:11,031 --> 02:15:15,092
{\fn幼圓}查理那一組在停車場…{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}We got Charlie unit in position by the parking structure.{\r}

1384
02:15:15,169 --> 02:15:19,196
{\fn幼圓}我想問一下 這道樓梯是不是直通電梯?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Let me ask you... Does this stairway go up to the escalator?{\r}

1385
02:15:19,306 --> 02:15:22,332
{\fn幼圓}-對 -告訴他們繼續{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}- Yeah. - Tell them to go ahead.{\r}

1386
02:15:23,043 --> 02:15:24,738
{\fn幼圓}你們要幹什麼?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}What's going on?{\r}

1387
02:15:25,445 --> 02:15:27,606
{\fn幼圓}你看呢?我們要衝進去{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}What's it look like? We're going in.{\r}

1388
02:15:27,748 --> 02:15:32,549
{\fn幼圓}衝進去!你瘋了嗎? 上面可能有30名人質{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Going in? That's crazy! There could be over 30 hostages in there for all we know.{\r}

1389
02:15:32,619 --> 02:15:34,553
{\fn幼圓}我們什麼也不知道,鮑爾{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}We don't know shit, Powell.{\r}

1390
02:15:34,621 --> 02:15:38,022
{\fn幼圓}如果有人質 為什麼不提出贖金的數目?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}If there's hostages, how come there are no ransom demands?{\r}

1391
02:15:38,125 --> 02:15:41,390
{\fn幼圓}如果有恐怖分子 他們為什麼不提出要求?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}If there's terrorists in there, where's their list of demands?{\r}

1392
02:15:41,461 --> 02:15:43,725
{\fn幼圓}我們只知道 有人向你的車開槍{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}All we know is that somebody shot your car up.{\r}

1393
02:15:43,797 --> 02:15:45,958
{\fn幼圓}說不定就是{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}It's probably the same silly son of a bitch{\r}

1394
02:15:46,033 --> 02:15:48,024
{\fn幼圓}剛才和你通話的蠢貨{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}you've been talking to on that radio.{\r}

1395
02:15:48,135 --> 02:15:49,796
{\fn幼圓}對不起,長官!{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Excuse me, sir,{\r}

1396
02:15:49,870 --> 02:15:53,169
{\fn幼圓}那具從天而降的屍體 又怎麼解釋?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}but what about the body that fell out the window?{\r}

1397
02:15:53,240 --> 02:15:56,232
{\fn幼圓}-也許是破產的股票經紀人 -我們準備好了,局長{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}- Maybe a stockbroker got depressed. - We're ready.{\r}

1398
02:15:56,343 --> 02:15:58,743
{\fn幼圓}-好吧,把燈打開,行動 -把燈打開{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}- Light 'em up. Let's go. - Hit your lights.{\r}

1399

{\fn幼圓}-藍隊行動 -開燈{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}- Blue units, go. - Lights on!{\r}

1400
02:16:13,627 --> 02:16:15,094
{\fn幼圓}鮑爾?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Powell?{\r}

1401
02:16:15,996 --> 02:16:18,658
{\fn幼圓}艾爾,你還在嗎,夥計? 這是怎麼了?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Powell, you still with me, babe? What's goin' on?{\r}

1402
02:16:19,399 --> 02:16:20,661
{\fn幼圓}嘿,艾爾?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Yo, Al.{\r}

1403
02:16:20,834 --> 02:16:24,565
{\fn幼圓}我在這兒,羅伊 不過我現在很忙,過會兒再說{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I'm here, Roy, but I'm busy right now. I'll talk to you later.{\r}

1404
02:16:24,638 --> 02:16:25,605
{\fn幼圓}艾爾,怎麼回事?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Al, what's wrong?{\r}

1405
02:16:25,672 --> 02:16:27,367
{\fn幼圓}我說了過會兒再說{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I'll talk to you later.{\r}

1406
02:16:27,441 --> 02:16:29,466
{\fn幼圓}如果你是我想的那樣{\r}

1506

{\fn幼圓}如果你沒有辦法 就別在這兒搗亂{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}if you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem.{\r}

1512

{\fn幼圓}我不想坐在這兒 看誰先把我們殺死{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I'm tired of sitting here waiting to see who gets us killed first,{\r}

1522

1524
02:26:55,602 --> 02:27:01,040
{\fn幼圓}我一頓飯就能談下百萬美元{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I negotiate million-dollar deals for breakfast. I think I can handle this Eurotrash.{\r}

1525

{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}What does he want?{\r}

1530
02:27:13,286 --> 02:27:16,949
{\fn幼圓}他想要什麼?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}It's not what I want. It's what I can give you.{\r}

1531
02:27:24,364 --> 02:27:26,696
{\fn幼圓}不是我想要什麼 而是我能給你們什麼{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Look, let's be straight, OK?{\r}

1532
02:27:27,967 --> 02:27:31,425
{\fn幼圓}聽著,我還是直說了吧{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}It's obvious you're not some dumb schmuck up here to snatch a few purses.{\r}

1533
02:27:31,504 --> 02:27:33,131
{\fn幼圓}很明顯,你們到這來不只是 為了偷幾個小錢,對嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}You're very perceptive.{\r}

1534

1536
02:27:37,744 --> 02:27:40,178
{\fn幼圓}我對自己說:「這些人都是行家{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}they're motivated, they're happening,{\r}

1537
02:27:40,280 --> 02:27:41,838

{\fn幼圓}總之,他們想要什麼東西{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I couldn't care less about your politics.{\r}

1539
02:27:44,851 --> 02:27:47,081
{\fn幼圓}我個人並不關心 你們的政治信仰{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Maybe you're pissed off at the camel jockeys.{\r}

1540
02:27:47,153 --> 02:27:50,088
{\fn幼圓}也許你們對阿拉伯人不滿{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Maybe it's Northern Ireland. It's none of my business.{\r}

1541
02:27:50,156 --> 02:27:52,488
{\fn幼圓}也許是以色列或是北愛 這不關我的事{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I figure you're here to negotiate, am I right?{\r}

1542
02:27:52,559 --> 02:27:53,685

1543
02:27:53,760 --> 02:27:56,126
{\fn幼圓}令人驚訝 全部是你自己想出來的?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}You figured this all out already?{\r}

1544
02:27:56,195 --> 02:27:58,322

{\fn幼圓}你們用槍,我用筆 有什麼區別?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}You use a gun, I use a fountain pen. What's the difference?{\r}

1546
02:28:01,734 --> 02:28:04,328
{\fn幼圓}我這樣說吧 你們的目的是錢{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}In my terms, you're here on a hostile takeover.{\r}

1547
02:28:04,404 --> 02:28:09,000

1600
02:31:05,752 --> 02:31:09,711
{\fn幼圓}他們需要雷管 否則他們會殺了我{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}They want the detonators, or they're gonna kill me.{\r}

1601

{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Tell them where the detonators are!{\r}

1605
02:31:26,372 --> 02:31:29,398

{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Then you'll give us what we want and save your friend's life.{\r}

1612

{\fn幼圓}老兄,把槍拿開 這是對講機,不是電視{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Babe, put away the gun. This is radio, not television.{\r}

1615
02:31:52,765 --> 02:31:56,394
{\fn幼圓}漢斯,這個混蛋不是我朋友! 我們剛碰面,我根本不認識他{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Hans, this asshole is not my friend! I don't know him!{\r}

1616

1618
02:32:04,076 --> 02:32:07,637

{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}He just let the guy die.{\r}

1625
02:32:49,222 --> 02:32:51,247
{\fn幼圓}他不管他的死活 把對講機給我{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}He gave him up. Give me that headset.{\r}

1626
02:32:51,324 --> 02:32:53,451
{\fn幼圓}這和親手扣扳機沒什麼兩樣{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}That's like pulling the trigger yourself.{\r}

1627
02:32:53,526 --> 02:32:57,189
{\fn幼圓}難道你不知道是怎麼回事嗎? 難道你看不出來嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Can't you see what's happening? Can't you read between the lines?{\r}

1630
02:33:02,869 --> 02:33:05,531
{\fn幼圓}不行,不行 他們要和我們談判{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}No way, man. They'd be talking to us.{\r}

1631
02:33:05,638 --> 02:33:09,096
{\fn幼圓}聽著,告訴你那位夥伴 從現在開始別再插手,你聽見了嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}You tell this partner of yours to stay out of this from now on.{\r}

1632
02:33:09,208 --> 02:33:12,735
{\fn幼圓}要是他不聽,我就要他好看 聽著,我會給他好看的{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Because if he doesn't, I'm really going to nail his ass.{\r}

1637
02:33:25,691 --> 02:33:28,626
{\fn幼圓}好好想想自己說的這些屁話{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Why don't you wake up and smell what you shovelin'?{\r}

1638
02:33:28,694 --> 02:33:30,252

{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}But what do you want with the detonators?{\r}

1779
02:42:49,050 --> 02:42:51,712
{\fn幼圓}我已經用光了所有炸藥{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I already used all the explosives.{\r}

1780
02:42:54,055 --> 02:42:55,386
{\fn幼圓}是嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Or did I?{\r}

1781
02:42:56,858 --> 02:42:58,450
{\fn幼圓}我只數到三{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I'm going to count to three.{\r}

1782
02:42:58,526 --> 02:43:00,994
{\fn幼圓}對了,就像對高木那樣?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Yeah. Like you did with Takagi?{\r}

1783
02:43:04,699 --> 02:43:06,030
{\fn幼圓}沒有子彈{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}No bullets.{\r}

1784
02:43:06,100 --> 02:43:09,194
{\fn幼圓}你以為我很蠢嗎,漢斯?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}What do you think... I'm fuckin' stupid, Hans?{\r}

1785
02:43:09,270 --> 02:43:10,294
{\fn幼圓}你說呢?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}You were saying?{\r}

1786
02:44:15,303 --> 02:44:17,203
{\fn幼圓}打碎玻璃{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Shoot the glass!{\r}

1787
02:44:50,571 --> 02:44:52,095
{\fn幼圓}王八蛋!{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Jesus Christ!{\r}

1788
02:45:21,335 --> 02:45:24,270
{\fn幼圓}笑吧,卡爾 我們又開張了{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Smile, Karl. We're back in business.{\r}

1789
02:45:26,974 --> 02:45:29,966
{\fn幼圓}…是外交的最後手段{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}...is the last resort of diplomacy,{\r}

1790
02:45:30,044 --> 02:45:33,070
{\fn幼圓}我們或許可以這麼說{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}then couldn't we just as well say{\r}

1791
02:45:33,181 --> 02:45:36,082
{\fn幼圓}恐怖主義也有同樣的效果{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}that terrorism has an equal claim on being that, too?{\r}

1792
02:45:36,784 --> 02:45:38,945
{\fn幼圓}告訴我你找到什麼了?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Tell me you got something.{\r}

1793
02:45:39,020 --> 02:45:42,979
{\fn幼圓}只有麥克連的名字、警徽號 任職記錄、基本數據{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}McClane's name, badge number, employment record, vital statistics,{\r}

1794
02:45:43,057 --> 02:45:45,548
{\fn幼圓}和他家人的地址{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}and his family's home address{\r}

1795
02:45:45,626 --> 02:45:47,059
{\fn幼圓}就在洛杉磯這喎\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}right here in LA.{\r}

1796
02:45:55,269 --> 02:45:56,429
{\fn幼圓}去工作{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Go to work.{\r}

1797
02:45:56,637 --> 02:45:58,434
{\fn幼圓}明白{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Got it.{\r}

1798
02:46:10,585 --> 02:46:13,816
{\fn幼圓}天哪,那個人好像真的很生氣{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}God, that man looks really pissed.{\r}

1799
02:46:16,190 --> 02:46:18,181
{\fn幼圓}他還活著{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}He's still alive.{\r}

1800
02:46:18,526 --> 02:46:19,584
{\fn幼圓}什麼?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}What?{\r}

1801
02:46:19,894 --> 02:46:23,830
{\fn幼圓}只有約翰才能把人逼成那樣{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Only John can drive somebody that crazy.{\r}

1802
02:46:40,712 --> 02:46:45,046
{\fn幼圓}漢斯,快帶你的奇?來 我們剛打開第六道{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Hans, heat up that miracle because we just broke through on number six{\r}

1803
02:46:45,116 --> 02:46:47,812
{\fn幼圓}電磁密封突然就啟動了{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}and the electromagnetic came down like an anvil.{\r}

1804
02:46:47,886 --> 02:46:53,256
{\fn幼圓}很好,先看看窗外的朋友 在幹什麼,我馬上就到{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Have a look at what our friends outside are doing and I'll be right up.{\r}

1805
02:46:55,660 --> 02:46:56,820
{\fn幼圓}嘿,約翰{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Hey, John.{\r}

1806
02:46:56,895 --> 02:46:59,329
{\fn幼圓}約翰．麥克連,你還在嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}John McClane, you still with us?{\r}

1807
02:46:59,431 --> 02:47:00,523
{\fn幼圓}在{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Yeah.{\r}

1808
02:47:01,333 --> 02:47:05,167
{\fn幼圓}不過要是讓我選 我寧願到費城去{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}But all things being equal, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.{\r}

1809
02:47:05,737 --> 02:47:07,864
{\fn幼圓}又幹掉兩個壞蛋{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Chalk up two more bad guys.{\r}

1810
02:47:08,240 --> 02:47:11,300
{\fn幼圓}很高興聽到這消息{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}The boys down here will be glad to hear that.{\r}

1811
02:47:11,877 --> 02:47:13,742
{\fn幼圓}知道嗎,我們都在你身上下了注{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}We got a pool going on you.{\r}

1812
02:47:13,845 --> 02:47:15,710
{\fn幼圓}我現在的賠率是多少?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}What kind of odds am I getting?{\r}

1813
02:47:15,780 --> 02:47:17,475
{\fn幼圓}你最好別知道{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}You don't want to know.{\r}

1814
02:47:17,549 --> 02:47:18,948
{\fn幼圓}幫我下20塊{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Put me down for 20.{\r}

1815
02:47:19,084 --> 02:47:20,244
{\fn幼圓}我賠得起{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I'm good for it.{\r}

1816
02:47:24,155 --> 02:47:26,783
{\fn幼圓}嘿,鮑爾,你是平足嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Hey, pal, you got flat feet?{\r}

1817
02:47:29,327 --> 02:47:31,522
{\fn幼圓}你這是什麼意思,夥計?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}What the hell you talking about, man?{\r}

1818
02:47:31,596 --> 02:47:33,996
{\fn幼圓}你為什麼不干巡警了?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Something had to get you off the street.{\r}

1819
02:47:34,132 --> 02:47:35,326
{\fn幼圓}這有什麼?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}What's the matter?{\r}

1820
02:47:35,400 --> 02:47:38,665
{\fn幼圓}你認為在辦公桌後面 整理文件就不是警察了嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}You don't think a desk job is a noble effort for a cop?{\r}

1821
02:47:40,572 --> 02:47:41,800
{\fn幼圓}不{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}No.{\r}

1822
02:47:45,310 --> 02:47:47,335
{\fn幼圓}我出過一次意外{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I had an accident.{\r}

1823
02:47:47,412 --> 02:47:49,710
{\fn幼圓}像你那樣開車肯定得出事{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}The way you drive, I can see why.{\r}

1824
02:47:49,781 --> 02:47:50,543
{\fn幼圓}是什麼事故?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}What'd you do?{\r}

1825
02:47:50,615 --> 02:47:53,209
{\fn幼圓}開車軋了隊長的腳嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Run over your captain's foot with the car?{\r}

1826
02:47:57,088 --> 02:47:58,316
{\fn幼圓}我殺了一個孩子{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I shot a kid.{\r}

1827
02:47:59,891 --> 02:48:01,722
{\fn幼圓}他當時只有13歲{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}He was 13 years old.{\r}

1828
02:48:02,961 --> 02:48:06,988
{\fn幼圓}天很黑,我看不清楚 他拿著逼真的玩具槍{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Oh, it was dark. I couldn't see him. He had a ray gun, looked real enough.{\r}

1829
02:48:10,302 --> 02:48:13,635
{\fn幼圓}警察學校 把你從菜鳥教成老手{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}When you're a rookie, they teach you everything about being a cop{\r}

1830
02:48:13,705 --> 02:48:15,969
{\fn幼圓}卻沒教你怎麼背下責任{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}except how to live with a mistake.{\r}

1831
02:48:19,978 --> 02:48:24,779
{\fn幼圓}總之,我再也無法 用槍指著任何人了{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Anyway, I just couldn't bring myself to draw my gun on anybody again.{\r}

1832
02:48:27,819 --> 02:48:29,184
{\fn幼圓}抱歉,夥計{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Sorry, man.{\r}

1833
02:48:30,655 --> 02:48:33,385
{\fn幼圓}嘿,夥計,你能體會嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Hey, man, how could you know?{\r}

1834
02:48:35,727 --> 02:48:37,558
{\fn幼圓}我現在感覺很糟{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I feel like shit anyway.{\r}

1835
02:48:40,565 --> 02:48:42,123
{\fn幼圓}那我還是告訴你吧{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Well, this won't matter.{\r}

1836
02:48:42,233 --> 02:48:46,966
{\fn幼圓}現在不是洛杉磯警察掌舵了{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}DoThe LAPD is not calling the shots down here anymore.{\r}

1837
02:48:49,441 --> 02:48:50,601
{\fn幼圓}調查局?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}The Feds?{\r}

1838
02:48:51,142 --> 02:48:52,234
{\fn幼圓}你說對了{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}You got it.{\r}

1839
02:48:54,880 --> 02:48:57,075
{\fn幼圓}你看,這些是市政工程師{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Those are the city engineers.{\r}

1840
02:48:57,349 --> 02:48:58,043
{\fn幼圓}等等{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Wait.{\r}

1841
02:48:58,884 --> 02:49:01,614
{\fn幼圓}他們在查看街道電路{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}They're going into the street circuits.{\r}

1842
02:49:01,686 --> 02:49:03,881
{\fn幼圓}看那些穿西裝的傢伙 不知是幹什麼的{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}The guys in suits, I don't know who they are.{\r}

1843
02:49:03,989 --> 02:49:05,752
{\fn幼圓}那就是調查局的{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}That's the FBI.{\r}

1844
02:49:05,824 --> 02:49:09,419
{\fn幼圓}他們依照程序 下令切斷大廈的電源{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}They're ordering the others to cut the building's power.{\r}

1845
02:49:09,494 --> 02:49:11,485
{\fn幼圓}像發條一樣規律{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Regular as clockwork.{\r}

1846
02:49:13,365 --> 02:49:14,889
{\fn幼圓}就像一把鑰匙{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Or a time lock.{\r}

1847
02:49:15,433 --> 02:49:17,162
{\fn幼圓}正確{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Precisely.{\r}

1848
02:49:17,269 --> 02:49:21,069
{\fn幼圓}為了對抗一起恐怖活動…{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}The circuits that cannot be cut are cut automatically{\r}

1849
02:49:21,172 --> 02:49:23,902
{\fn幼圓}無法切斷的電路 於是被迫切斷了{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}in response to a terrorist incident.{\r}

1850
02:49:24,009 --> 02:49:25,476
{\fn幼圓}想要奇?,西奧 就去找…{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}You asked for miracles, Theo.{\r}

1851
02:49:26,211 --> 02:49:29,476
{\fn幼圓}聯邦調查局{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I give you the F-B-I.{\r}

1852
02:49:31,483 --> 02:49:32,415
{\fn幼圓}-我要你切斷這座大廈的電源! -嘿,我這兒有點問題{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I want the building shut down.{\r}

1853
02:49:32,484 --> 02:49:34,645
{\fn幼圓}我不管你有什麼樣的問題! 必須關閉這個開關{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I got a problem. I got a switch...{\r}

1854
02:49:34,719 --> 02:49:38,712
{\fn幼圓}不能從這兒切斷{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I don't care about your switch. I want it out. Dark!{\r}

1855
02:49:39,691 --> 02:49:41,215
{\fn幼圓}-可以 -不能從這兒切斷!{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}You can't do it from here.{\r}

1856
02:49:41,326 --> 02:49:43,726
{\fn幼圓}我們可以…我有對講機{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}- Yeah, you could. - It can't be done from here.{\r}

1857
02:49:43,828 --> 02:49:45,489
{\fn幼圓}不能從這兒切斷電源 只能從市中心切斷{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I could... I got the radio...{\r}

1858
02:49:45,597 --> 02:49:49,055
{\fn幼圓}整個電網都會斷電{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}You can't do it from here. It's got to be done from downtown.{\r}

1859
02:49:49,134 --> 02:49:53,002
{\fn幼圓}這關係到十個街區{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}They've gotta take out a whole city grid. We're talking 10 square blocks.{\r}

1860
02:49:53,071 --> 02:49:54,902
{\fn幼圓}十個街區? 天哪,強森,你瘋了嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Ten blocks? Johnson, that's crazy.{\r}

1861
02:49:55,006 --> 02:49:57,600
{\fn幼圓}今天是聖誕夜,成千上萬的人…{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}It's Christmas Eve. There's thousands of people.{\r}

1862
02:49:57,676 --> 02:49:59,337
{\fn幼圓}我們必須這樣做!{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}You have to go wider.{\r}

1863
02:49:59,444 --> 02:50:04,507
{\fn幼圓}-我需要授權! -美國政府授權還不夠嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}- I need authorization. - How about the United States government?{\r}

1864
02:50:04,616 --> 02:50:06,675
{\fn幼圓}切斷電網,要麼丟掉飯碗{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Lose the grid, or you lose yourjob.{\r}

1865
02:50:12,857 --> 02:50:14,654
{\fn幼圓}中心嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Yeah, Central?{\r}

1866
02:50:14,726 --> 02:50:17,058
{\fn幼圓}我是沃爾特,在中富大廈{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}This is Walt, down at Nakatomi.{\r}

1867
02:50:17,128 --> 02:50:22,065
{\fn幼圓}聽著 你幫我切斷212電網好嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Would it be possible for you to turn off grid 212?{\r}

1868
02:50:22,133 --> 02:50:23,259
{\fn幼圓}你瘋了嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Are you crazy?!{\r}

1869
02:50:23,368 --> 02:50:26,030
{\fn幼圓}也許我該給市長打個電話{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Maybe I should call the mayor.{\r}

1870
02:50:26,104 --> 02:50:29,164
{\fn幼圓}倒霉的是我,我這兒麻煩大了 快關掉{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}No shit it's my ass. I got a big problem here.{\r}

1871
02:50:29,274 --> 02:50:31,674
{\fn幼圓}切斷電源,馬上!{\r}

{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Emergency lighting activated.{\r}

1873
02:50:37,782 --> 02:50:40,649

{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Al, talk to me. What's going on here?{\r}

1874

{\fn幼圓}去問調查局吧{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Ask the FBI.{\r}

1875
02:50:42,320 --> 02:50:45,084
{\fn幼圓}他們正拿著反恐怖指南{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}They got the universal terrorist playbook{\r}

1876
02:50:45,156 --> 02:50:46,623
{\fn幼圓}按部就班地照辦{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}and they're running it step by step.{\r}

1877
02:50:49,728 --> 02:50:51,662
{\fn幼圓}要打開了,要開了!{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}It's gonna go. It's gonna go!{\r}

1878
02:50:53,465 --> 02:50:54,864

{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Merry Christmas.{\r}

1880
02:51:20,725 --> 02:51:23,888
{\fn幼圓}那幫雜種可能已經尿了褲子了{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}They must be pissing in their pants.{\r}

1881
02:51:23,962 --> 02:51:25,827
{\fn幼圓}市長會殺了我{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}The mayor is gonna have my ass.{\r}

1882
02:51:47,152 --> 02:51:49,382
{\fn幼圓}現在我們該怎麼辦?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}What are we gonna do now?{\r}

1883
02:51:49,454 --> 02:51:52,446
{\fn幼圓}因為拒付電費逮捕他們嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Arrest them for not paying their electric bill?{\r}

1884
02:51:52,590 --> 02:51:54,353
{\fn幼圓}把他們關在堶惋\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}We've shut them down.{\r}

1885
02:51:54,426 --> 02:51:57,862
{\fn幼圓}讓他們流點冷汗 然後給他們直昇機{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}We let them sweat for a while, then we give them helicopters.{\r}

1886
02:51:57,962 --> 02:52:00,157
{\fn幼圓}一個不留{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Right up the ass.{\r}

1887
02:52:02,767 --> 02:52:04,257
{\fn幼圓}我是強森探員{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}This is Agent Johnson.{\r}

1888

{\fn幼圓}我需要空中支援在五分鐘內出發{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I want that air support ready to lift off in five minutes.{\r}

1890
02:52:09,207 --> 02:52:12,665
{\fn幼圓}沒錯,全副武裝,我們馬上就到{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Damn right. Fully armed. We're on the way.{\r}

1891
02:52:18,616 --> 02:52:20,481
{\fn幼圓}耶!{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Oh, yes!{\r}

1892
02:52:22,220 --> 02:52:24,654
{\fn幼圓}我要和聯邦調查局的人談{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I wish to talk to the FBI.{\r}

1893
02:52:27,225 --> 02:52:29,352
{\fn幼圓}我是特別探員強森{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}This is Special Agent Johnson.{\r}

1894
02:52:29,427 --> 02:52:33,887
{\fn幼圓}州政府已經安排你的同志們回家了{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}The State Department has arranged for the return of your comrades.{\r}

1895
02:52:33,998 --> 02:52:36,626
{\fn幼圓}直昇機馬上就到,按照你的要求{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Helicopters are en route as you requested.{\r}

1896
02:52:36,701 --> 02:52:38,965
{\fn幼圓}我知道了,我們正在準備{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I hear you. We'll be ready.{\r}

1897
02:52:39,037 --> 02:52:41,437
{\fn幼圓}等他知道上當的時候 已經在屍袋堣F{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}When he figures out what hit him, he'll be in a body bag.{\r}

1898
02:52:42,273 --> 02:52:45,174
{\fn幼圓}他們一著陸,我們就炸了樓頂{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}When they touch down, we'll blow the roof.{\r}

1899
02:52:45,243 --> 02:52:50,476
{\fn幼圓}等他們查出原因 我們已經在海灘上吃紅利了{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}By the time they figure it all out, we'll be sitting on a beach earning 20%.{\r}

1900
02:52:56,471 --> 02:52:57,961
{\fn幼圓}哦,媽的!{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Ah! Jeez!{\r}

1901
02:52:58,073 --> 02:52:59,097
{\fn幼圓}鮑爾?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Powell?{\r}

1902
02:52:59,941 --> 02:53:01,772
{\fn幼圓}嘿,鮑爾,你有空嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Yo, Powell, you got a minute?{\r}

1903
02:53:03,511 --> 02:53:05,206
{\fn幼圓}我在這兒,約翰{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I'm here, John.{\r}

1904
02:53:06,948 --> 02:53:10,475
{\fn幼圓}聽著,夥計,我現在有一種 不祥的感覺{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Listen, I'm starting to get a bad feeling up here.{\r}

1905
02:53:10,552 --> 02:53:12,520
{\fn幼圓}我想請你幫我一個忙{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I want you to do something for me.{\r}

1906

{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I want you to find my wife. Don't ask me how. By then you'll know how.{\r}

02:53:21,429 --> 02:53:26,093
{\fn幼圓}請你幫我轉告她 我想請你告訴她…{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I want you to tell her something. I want you to tell her that...{\r}

1908
02:53:33,007 --> 02:53:35,635
{\fn幼圓}告訴她我現在才知道{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Tell her it took me a while to figure out{\r}

1909
02:53:35,744 --> 02:53:37,837
{\fn幼圓}我真是個混蛋{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}what ajerk I've been{\r}

1910
02:53:38,413 --> 02:53:39,641
{\fn幼圓}不過{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}but...{\r}

1911
02:53:41,349 --> 02:53:42,338
{\fn幼圓}在她…{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}that...{\r}

1912
02:53:46,221 --> 02:53:48,951
{\fn幼圓}在她獲得大好機會的時候{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}that when things started to pan out for her{\r}

1913
02:53:49,023 --> 02:53:53,050
{\fn幼圓}我本應該去支持她{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I shoulda... been more supportive.{\r}

1914
02:53:53,528 --> 02:53:54,392
{\fn幼圓}而且…{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}And...{\r}

1915
02:53:55,930 --> 02:53:59,058
{\fn幼圓}讓她無後顧之憂{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I just should have been behind her more.{\r}

1916
02:54:01,603 --> 02:54:02,865
{\fn幼圓}哦,媽的{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Oh, shit.{\r}

1917
02:54:05,540 --> 02:54:07,599
{\fn幼圓}你告訴她{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Tell her that...{\r}

1918
02:54:08,543 --> 02:54:13,139
{\fn幼圓}對我這樣的流浪漢 她簡直就是一種恩賜{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}that she's the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me.{\r}

1919
02:54:15,049 --> 02:54:18,485
{\fn幼圓}她曾聽我說過一千遍 「我愛你」{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}She's heard me say "I love you" a thousand times.{\r}

1920
02:54:19,654 --> 02:54:23,090
{\fn幼圓}卻從未聽我說「對不起」{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}She never heard me say "I'm sorry".{\r}

1921
02:54:23,691 --> 02:54:29,960
{\fn幼圓}我希望你幫我告訴她 約翰說對不起{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I want you to tell her that, Al. Tell her that John said that he was sorry.{\r}

1922
02:54:31,299 --> 02:54:32,357

{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}OK?{\r}

{\fn幼圓}你聽見了嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}You got that, man?{\r}

1924
02:54:34,569 --> 02:54:36,833
{\fn幼圓}是,我聽見了,約翰{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Yeah, I got it, John.{\r}

1925
02:54:38,173 --> 02:54:40,641
{\fn幼圓}你可以自己去跟她說{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}But you can tell her that yourself.{\r}

1926
02:54:41,075 --> 02:54:45,171
{\fn幼圓}只要你小心 肯定能活著出來,你明白嗎?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}You just watch your ass and you'll make it out. You hear me?{\r}

1927
02:54:45,246 --> 02:54:47,612
{\fn幼圓}哦,我想這得問問樓上的人{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I guess that's up to the man upstairs.{\r}

1928
02:54:51,019 --> 02:54:52,486
{\fn幼圓}約翰?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}John?{\r}

1929
02:54:53,321 --> 02:54:54,788
{\fn幼圓}約翰?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}John?{\r}

1930
02:54:55,256 --> 02:54:58,783
{\fn幼圓}你在樓上搞什麼鬼,漢斯?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}What the fuck were you doing upstairs, Hans?{\r}

1931
02:55:00,428 --> 02:55:01,452
{\fn幼圓}約翰!{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}John?{\r}

1932
02:55:01,529 --> 02:55:04,657
{\fn幼圓}哦,艾爾,聽著 過會兒再和你聊{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}No, Al, listen. Just lay off for a while.{\r}

1933
02:55:06,668 --> 02:55:09,432
{\fn幼圓}我現在得去查看一下{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}I gotta go check on something.{\r}

1934
02:55:12,207 --> 02:55:14,698
{\fn幼圓}一分鐘!我只要一分鐘{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}One minute, that's all I'm asking.{\r}

1935
02:55:14,809 --> 02:55:16,674
{\fn幼圓}我只和他們談一分鐘{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}One minute to speak to them.{\r}

1936
02:55:16,744 --> 02:55:18,803
{\fn幼圓}好吧,不許生人進來{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}All right. Get back. Get back.{\r}

1937
02:55:18,880 --> 02:55:21,280
{\fn幼圓}好吧,退後,走!走!{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}All right, look.{\r}

1938
02:55:21,349 --> 02:55:25,513
{\fn幼圓}聽著,你讓我進去 否則我就找移民局{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}You let me in right now, or I call the INS, comprende?{\r}

1939
02:55:28,122 --> 02:55:33,253
{\fn幼圓}這也許是孩子們最後一次 和他們的父母說話{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}This is the last time these kids are gonna have to speak to their parents.{\r}

1940
02:55:34,329 --> 02:55:35,455

{\fn幼圓}你在幹什麼,漢斯?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}What were you doin', Hans?{\r}

1943
02:55:50,178 --> 02:55:51,668
{\fn幼圓}你在幹什麼?{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}What were you doin'?{\r}

1944
02:56:14,269 --> 02:56:17,466

{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}The roof is wired to...{\r}

1947
02:56:27,916 --> 02:56:28,940
{\fn幼圓}約翰?{\r}

1951
02:56:36,224 --> 02:56:39,216
{\fn幼圓}好像是什麼圈套{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Something about a double cross.{\r}

1952
02:56:39,327 --> 02:56:41,625
{\fn幼圓}這還用你說{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Tell me about it.{\r}

1953

{\fn幼圓}我們都是高手{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}We are both professionals.{\r}

1954
02:56:51,706 --> 02:56:53,367
{\fn幼圓}這是私人恩怨{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}This is personal.{\r}

1955
02:57:17,098 --> 02:57:19,396

{\fn幼圓}你有什麼話要告訴他們嗎? 他們正看著呢{\r}
{\fn幼圓\fscx75\fscy75}Is there something you'd like to say to them, if they're watching?{\r}

1961
