1
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,950
You don't like flying, do you?

2
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,450
What gives you that idea?

3
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:08,250
You want to know the secret
to surviving air travel?

4
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:11,050
After you get where you're going,
take off your shoes and socks.

5
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:15,750
Then you walk around on the rug barefoot
and make fists with your toes.

6
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,150
Fists with your toes?

7
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:21,650
I know. It sounds crazy.

8
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,650
Trust me.
I've been doing it for nine years.

9
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:28,250
Yes, sir! Better than a shower
and a hot cup of coffee.

10
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:29,350
OK.

11
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:41,150
It's OK. I'm a cop.

12
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:47,450
Trust me.
I've been doing this for 11 years.

13
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:50,450
<i>On behalf of the captain and the crew,</i>

14
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:53,250
<i>I'd like to welcome you to Los Angeles.</i>

15
00:01:53,285 --> 00:01:56,050
<i>Have a very merry Christmas.</i>

16
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:08,050
<i>Flight 247 to Tucson
now boarding at gate 14.</i>

17
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:14,650
<i>Flight 247 to Tucson
now boarding at gate 14.</i>

18
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,750
How do you do?

19
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,750
Ladies and gentlemen...

20
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:46,250
Ladies and gentlemen!

21
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:49,350
I want to congratulate
each and every one of you

22
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:52,050
for making this
one of the greatest years

23
00:02:52,085 --> 00:02:54,550
in the history
of the Nakatomi Corporation.

24
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:01,250
On behalf of the Chief
Executive Officer, Mr Ozu,

25
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,550
and the Board of Directors,

26
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,450
we thank you one and all

27
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,850
and wish you a merry Christmas
and a happy New Year!

28
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,450
Merry Christmas!
Happy New Year!

29
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,550
Hey, Holly.
What about dinner tonight?

30
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:18,250
Harry, it's Christmas Eve.

31
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:21,450
Families, stockings...

32
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,850
Chestnuts?

33
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,750
Rudolph and Frosty?

34
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,850
Any of these things ring a bell?

35
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,550
Actually, I was thinking more of

36
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:34,250
mulled wine, a nice aged Brie

37
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:38,450
and a roaring fireplace.
You know what I'm saying?

38
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:43,850
Ginny, it's 5.40. Go join the party.
Have some champagne.

39
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,450
You're making me feel
like Ebenezer Scrooge.

40
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:50,250
Thanks. Do you think the baby
can handle a little sip?

41
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:53,350
That baby's ready to tend bar.

42
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,850
Last chance.

43
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:56,850
Bye.

44
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:05,750
McClane residence.
Lucy McClane speaking.

45
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:09,850
Hello, Lucy McClane.
This is your mother speaking.

46
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:12,750
<i>Mommy!
When are you coming home?</i>

47
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,950
Pretty soon.

48
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:17,350
You'll be in bed
when I get there, though.

49
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,950
Let me talk to Paulina, OK, hon?

50
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:24,350
And no snooping around the house
looking for presents.

51
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,950
Is Daddy coming home with you?

52
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:30,550
Well, we'll see what

53
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:33,150
Santa and Mommy can do, OK?

54
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,750
Put Paulina on. Bye, honey.

55
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,350
<i>Paulina!</i>

56
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,350
Hola, Mrs Holly.

57
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,050
Um, did Mr McClane call?

58
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,750
<i>No, Mrs Holly. No telefono.</i>

59
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:54,150
He probably didn't have time
before his flight.

60
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,050
It might be a good idea
to make up the spare bedroom

61
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,150
<i>just in case.</i>

62
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,350
SÃ­, Mrs Holly. I do that already.

63
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:04,450
What would I do without you, Paulina?

64
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,950
California!

65
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,750
Hey, I'm John McClane.

66
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:46,850
Argyle.

67
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,850
I'm your limo driver.

68
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,150
Nice bear.

69
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,850
OK... Argyle.

70
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,750
What do we do now?

71
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:04,750
I was, uh, hoping you could tell me.

72
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,750
It's my first time driving a limo.

73
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,850
That's OK.
It's my first time riding in one.

74
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,650
Relax.
We got everything in this mug, man.

75
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,350
Look at this... CD, CB, TV,

76
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,550
telephone, full bar, VHS.

77
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,850
If your friend's hot to trot,

78
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,750
I know a few mama bears
we can hook up with.

79
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,450
Or is he married?

80
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,150
He's married.

81
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,250
OK.

82
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:35,150
Sorry about that.
It's the girl's day off.

83
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,650
I didn't know
you were gonna sit up front.

84
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,250
Your lady live out here?

85
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:41,450
About the past six months.

86
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,550
Meaning you still live in New York?

87
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:48,450
You always ask
this many questions, Argyle?

88
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:52,150
Sorry. I used to drive a cab
and people would expect a little chitchat.

89
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:56,550
- So, you divorced?
- Just drive the car, man.

90
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:00,450
Hey, come on. You divorced?
You separated? She beat you up!?

91
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:07,450
She had a good job.
It turned into a great career.

92
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:12,850
- That meant she had to move here.
- You're very fast, Argyle.

93
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,250
So, why didn't you come?

94
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:18,450
Well?

95
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,050
Why didn't you come with her?

96
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:22,115
Because I'm a New York cop.

97
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:27,250
I got a backlog of New York scumbags
I'm still trying to put behind bars.

98
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,250
I can't just go that easy.

99
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:31,850
You thought she wasn't
gonna make it out here

100
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:36,250
and she'd come crawling back to you
so why bother to pack, right?

101
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:39,350
Like I said, you're very fast, Argyle.

102
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:40,950
Mind if we hear some tunes?

103
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:46,850
Hey, that'll work.

104
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:50,950
Don't you got any Christmas music?

105
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:53,750
This is Christmas music.

106
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,450
So your lady sees you,
you run into each other's arms,

107
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:29,050
the music comes up
and you live happily ever after, right?

108
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,050
I can live with that.

109
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,450
So, if it doesn't work out,
you got a place to stay?

110
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:37,150
I'll find a place.

111
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,250
I tell you what...

112
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:44,250
I'll wait in the parking garage. You score,
give me a call on the car phone.

113
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:49,250
I'll take your bags to the desk.
You strike out, I'll get you a hotel.

114
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:53,850
- You're all right, Argyle.
- Remember that when you sign for the tip.

115
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,450
- Hi.
- Good evening.

116
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,150
I'm here to see Holly McClane.

117
00:09:22,185 --> 00:09:24,750
Just type it in there.

118
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,250
Cute toy.

119
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:34,750
Yeah, if you have to take a leak,
it'll even help you find your zipper.

120
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,450
Christ.

121
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,650
- Thirtieth floor?
- The party.

122
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,550
They're the only ones
left in the building.

123
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,150
Take the express elevator.

124
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,250
Get off where you hear the noise.

125
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,150
Thanks.

126
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,850
- Champagne, sir?
- Yeah, thanks.

127
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,150
Oh, I'm sorry.

128
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:48,250
Hey! Merry Christmas!

129
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,650
Jesus.

130
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,850
Fuckin' California!

131
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:58,150
I couldn't agree with you more.

132
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,350
Why don't I talk to him right now?

133
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,850
Hi. I'm looking for...

134
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:05,350
- Holly Gennero.
- Yeah.

135
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:07,650
Then you must be John McClane.

136
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,850
Joe Takagi.
How was your ride in?

137
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:12,450
Nice. I have you to thank for that?

138
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,750
Seemed the least we could do.

139
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:18,450
- Quite a place you have here.
- It will be if we ever get it finished.

140
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,550
Still several floors under construction.

141
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:25,050
Holly went to fax some documents.
She should be back any minute.

142
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:28,750
In the meanwhile,
her office is back here.

143
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,050
Ellis?

144
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:36,450
I was just making a call.
This was the nearest phone.

145
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:38,650
I want you to meet John McClane,

146
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:40,350
Holly's husband.

147
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,550
Holly's policeman.

148
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:44,950
Ellis is in charge
of international development.

149
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,550
Heard a lot about you.

150
00:12:47,585 --> 00:12:49,350
You missed some.

151
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:52,650
Can I get you anything?

152
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,850
Food? Cake?
Some watered-down champagne?

153
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,950
No, thank you. I'm fine.

154
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:01,150
You throw quite a party.

155
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:05,550
I didn't realize they celebrated
Christmas in Japan.

156
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:06,750
We're flexible.

157
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:09,750
Pearl Harbor didn't work out,
so we got you with tape decks.

158
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:16,450
It's sort of a double celebration.
We closed a pretty big deal today

159
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,950
and a lot of it was due to Holly.
Right, Joe?

160
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,650
I'll be out in a couple of minutes.

161
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:27,150
John.

162
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,250
Have you met everyone?

163
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:35,350
We've been sticking him with spears.

164
00:13:35,385 --> 00:13:37,450
Of course he has.

165
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:41,550
She was made for the business.
Tough as nails.

166
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:44,050
I was hoping you made that flight.

167
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:46,250
Show him the watch.

168
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:47,850
Later.

169
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:50,050
Show him. Are you embarrassed?

170
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:53,150
It's just a small token of appreciation

171
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,850
for all her hard work. It's a Rolex.

172
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:58,350
I'm sure I'll see it later.

173
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,650
Is there a place
where I could wash up?

174
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,450
Sure.

175
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:19,950
You have to forgive Ellis.

176
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,550
He gets very depressed
this time of year.

177
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:26,350
<i>He thought he was
God's greatest gift, you know?</i>

178
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:28,650
I know the type.

179
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:31,550
I think he's got his eye on you.

180
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:35,650
That's OK. I have my eye
on his private bathroom.

181
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:38,950
Where are you staying?
Things happened so fast

182
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:41,750
I didn't get a chance
to ask you on the phone.

183
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:44,350
Cappy Roberts retired out here.

184
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,550
Oh, yeah?

185
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,250
He said I could bunk with him.

186
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,650
Cappy retired, huh?
Where's he live?

187
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,950
- Romona.
- Ha! Pomona.

188
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:55,650
- Huh?
- Pomona.

189
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,550
- Pomona.
- Yeah.

190
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,850
You'll be in the car half the time.

191
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,750
Why don't we make it easy?
I have a spare bedroom.

192
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:08,550
It's not huge or anything, but

193
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:12,150
the kids would love to have you
at the house.

194
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,850
They would, huh?

195
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,450
I would, too.

196
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:25,150
Sorry.

197
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:34,650
I missed you.

198
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:43,150
Didn't miss my name, though, huh?

199
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:47,150
Except maybe
when you're signing checks?

200
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,350
Since when did you start using
Ms Gennero?

201
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:55,750
This is a Japanese company.
They figure a married woman's...

202
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,050
<i>You are a married woman.</i>

203
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:00,950
This conversation again?
We did this in July.

204
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:03,250
We never finished this conversation.

205
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,650
I had an opportunity. I had to take it.

206
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,550
No matter what it did to our marriage.

207
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:10,950
It only changed your idea
of our marriage.

208
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:12,750
You have no clue what my idea...

209
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:16,450
I know exactly what your idea
of our marriage should be.

210
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,350
Ms Gennero, I...

211
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,750
Excuse me.

212
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,650
Hi.

213
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,050
Um, Mr Takagi is looking for you.

214
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,650
He wants you to say something
to the troops.

215
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,550
Thank you.

216
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,150
Speech time.

217
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:39,050
Be back in a few minutes.

218
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,450
That was great, John.

219
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:55,550
Good job. Very mature.

220
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,450
So Kareem rebounds.

221
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:50,350
Feeds Worthy on the break,
over to AC, to Magic,

222
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:51,650
then back to Worthy.

223
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:54,850
Boom! Two points.

224
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:00,250
We're in.

225
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,050
Links,

226
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:35,115
rechts,

227
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,950
und wieder links.

228
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:09,050
Son of a bitch.

229
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,450
Fists with your toes.

230
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,050
Yeah, Argyle?

231
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,850
<i>How's it going?</i>

232
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,215
All right. Where are you?

233
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:53,250
Down at the garage.
What's with you and your lady?

234
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:55,650
The vote's not in yet.

235
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,850
- Hey, Bruder.
- Moment.

236
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:08,950
Nein! Nein! Nein!

237
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:28,550
Argyle?

238
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:31,250
Mac, you there? Hello?

239
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:42,050
You know the number. Use it.

240
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:16,250
Stay calm.
Everything's going to be fine.

241
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:18,950
Everything's going to be fine.

242
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,750
Shit!

243
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:44,250
Think.

244
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,150
Think.

245
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:05,350
Ladies and gentlemen.

246
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:07,750
Ladies and gentlemen.

247
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:19,350
Due to the Nakatomi Corporation's
legacy of greed around the globe

248
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:23,350
<i>they're about to be taught a lesson
in the real use of power.</i>

249
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,950
You will be witnesses.

250
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,150
Now

251
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:33,150
where is Mr Takagi?

252
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:39,150
Joseph Yashinobo Takagi,

253
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,650
born Kyoto, 1937

254
00:25:42,685 --> 00:25:44,550
Don't move.

255
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:48,750
Family emigrated to San Pedro,
California, 1939,

256
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:54,650
interned at Manzanar, 1942 to '43,

257
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:59,650
scholarship student,
University of California,

258
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,150
1955.

259
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:10,250
Law degree, Stanford, 1962.

260
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:14,050
MBA, Harvard, 1970.

261
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,950
President, Nakatomi Trading.

262
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:21,350
Vice Chairman,
Nakatomi Investment Group...

263
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:22,550
Enough.

264
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:25,750
And father

265
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,150
of five.

266
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,050
I am Takagi.

267
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:32,650
How do you do?

268
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:34,950
It's a pleasure to meet you.

269
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:50,350
OK, 32... construction,
33... computers.

270
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:05,350
Nice suit.

271
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:08,150
John Phillips, London.

272
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:12,550
I have two myself.

273
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:16,150
Rumor has it
Arafat buys his there.

274
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:23,750
- This way?
- On the left.

275
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:49,750
<i>And when Alexander saw
the breadth of his domain</i>

276
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:53,650
<i>he wept, for there were
no more worlds to conquer.</i>

277
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:00,950
The benefits of a classical education.

278
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:04,250
Ohh, that's beautiful.

279
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:09,550
I always enjoyed to make models
when I was a boy.

280
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:14,450
The exactness, the attention
to every conceivable detail.

281
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:16,750
It's beautiful.

282
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:20,050
Is this what this is all about?
Our project in Indonesia?

283
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,950
Contrary to what you people may think,

284
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:27,550
we're going to develop
that region, not exploit it.

285
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:32,250
<i>I believe you.
I read the article in Forbes.</i>

286
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,650
Mr Takagi,

287
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:41,050
I could talk about industrialization
and men's fashions all day

288
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:43,250
but I'm afraid work must intrude

289
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:46,450
and my associate here
has some questions for you.

290
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:50,250
Sort of fill-in-the-blanks questions,
actually.

291
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:01,450
I don't have that code.

292
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:04,850
You broke in here
to access our computer?

293
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:07,150
Any information you could get

294
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:09,450
when they wake up in Tokyo,
they'll change it.

295
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:12,450
You won't be able to blackmail
our executives...

296
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,650
Sit... down!

297
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:28,150
Mr Takagi, I'm really not
interested in your computer.

298
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:34,850
But I need the code key

299
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:39,950
<i>because I am interested
in the $640 million</i>

300
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:44,850
in negotiable bearer bonds
that you have locked in your vault

301
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:48,550
and the computer
controls the vault.

302
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,750
You want money?

303
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:54,650
What kind of terrorists are you?

304
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:00,350
Who said we were terrorists?

305
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:22,650
The bonds represent, at most

306
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:26,550
10 days' operating capital
for your parent organization.

307
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:29,950
It's really no more
than a temporary inconvenience.

308
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:31,050
Now...

309
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:37,250
the code, please.

310
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:39,550
It's useless to you.

311
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:43,050
There are seven safeguards on our vault
and the code key's only one of them.

312
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:44,550
You'll never get it open.

313
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:47,150
Then there's no reason
not to tell it to us.

314
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:51,950
- I told you.
- It's not over yet.

315
00:30:56,550 --> 00:31:00,150
It's a very nice suit, Mr Takagi.

316
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:04,150
It would be a shame to ruin it.

317
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:08,750
I'm going to count to three.

318
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:12,750
There will not be a four.

319
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:15,550
Give me the code.

320
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,750
One,

321
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:22,050
two,

322
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:26,150
- three,
- I don't know it.

323
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:29,150
Get on a jet to Tokyo
and ask the chairman.

324
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:30,850
You're just gonna have to kill me.

325
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:32,150
OK.

326
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:37,650
We do it the hard way.

327
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,750
Tony, see if you can dispose of that.

328
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:43,150
Karl, you better check on Heinrich's work
up on the machine floor.

329
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:09,550
Nothing.

330
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:12,050
See to Heinrich.

331
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:15,050
Now

332
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:17,950
<i>you can break the code?</i>

333
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:23,750
You didn't bring me
for my charming personality.

334
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:31,150
Argyle, tell me you heard the shots.

335
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:33,250
You're calling the police right now.

336
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:35,250
Of course I'm still coming by later.

337
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:38,650
Sweetheart, have I ever lied to you?

338
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:41,950
My boss? He thinks
I'm on my way to Vegas.

339
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:45,850
Uli, get up on the pipes.

340
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:48,550
Marco, you go through here.

341
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:52,150
I'll throw you the cord.

342
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,850
Hans, we're on the roof.

343
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,650
Here.

344
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:17,350
Uli.

345
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:26,915
30 minutes to break the code,

346
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:31,550
two hours, two and a half hours
for the five mechanicals, at the minimum.

347
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:34,850
The 7th lock, however,
is out of my hands.

348
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:58,915
I'm sorry?

349
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:01,850
The 7th lock...
the electromagnetic seal.

350
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:04,950
You do understand the circuits
cannot be cut locally?

351
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:07,950
Trust me.

352
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:12,850
Why the fuck
didn't you stop him, John?

353
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:16,750
'Cause then you'd be dead, too,
asshole.

354
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:18,850
Think, goddamn it! Think!

355
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:32,950
We've got a fire alarm.

356
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:35,215
Call 911.

357
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:39,250
Give them the guard's name
and cancel the alarm.

358
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:40,650
Then disable the sys...

359
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:47,050
Eddie, on what floor
did the alarm go off?

360
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:50,650
Shall we go?

361
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:52,150
Nein.

362
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:04,450
Yes.

363
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:07,450
Hello, baby.
Come to Papa. Come on.

364
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:09,850
Ah ha ha ha!

365
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:12,850
Come on, baby.

366
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:14,450
Come on, baby.

367
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:15,850
Come on, baby. Come to Papa.

368
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:18,450
I'll kiss your fuckin' Dalmatian.

369
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:23,550
You stupid motherfuckers!
No! No!

370
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:26,050
Turn the fuckin' truck around!

371
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:02,650
The fire has been called off, my friend.

372
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:09,650
No-one is coming to help you.

373
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:16,850
You might as well come out
and join the others.

374
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:21,650
I promise I won't hurt you.

375
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:54,250
Drop it, dickhead. It's the police.

376
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:56,150
You won't hurt me.

377
00:36:56,185 --> 00:36:57,950
Yeah? Why not?

378
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,950
Because you're a policeman.

379
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:02,450
There are rules for policemen.

380
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:06,050
Yeah, that's what my captain
keeps telling me.

381
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,850
Bet your ass I wish to proceed.

382
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:57,150
Nine million terrorists in the world

383
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:00,450
and I got to kill one with feet
smaller than my sister.

384
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:52,250
I wanted this to be professional,

385
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:54,350
efficient, adult, cooperative.

386
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:55,550
Not a lot to ask.

387
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:58,650
Alas, your Mr Takagi
did not see it that way

388
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:02,350
so he won't be joining us
for the rest of his life.

389
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:06,450
We can go any way you want it.

390
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:11,150
You can walk out of here
or be carried out

391
00:40:11,185 --> 00:40:14,650
but have no illusions...
we are in charge.

392
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:20,050
So... decide now, each of you

393
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:22,150
and please remember

394
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:25,750
we have left nothing to chance.

395
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:31,550
It's Tony!

396
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:35,450
Get them back!

397
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:47,750
<i>Now I have a machine gun.</i>

398
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:52,650
<i>Ho... ho... ho.</i>

399
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:57,550
A security guard we missed?

400
00:40:57,650 --> 00:41:02,750
They're usually tired old policemen.
No, this is something else.

401
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:14,550
We have to do something, Hans.

402
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:15,950
Yes, we do.

403
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:18,450
Tell Karl his brother is dead.

404
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,450
Tell him to come down.

405
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:24,050
Karl... komm sofort.

406
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:26,850
Franco, Fritz, take the body upstairs

407
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:28,150
and out of sight.

408
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:31,050
I don't want the hostages
to think too much.

409
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:33,150
Komm sofort. Schnell.

410
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:37,150
I want blood!

411
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:40,250
You'll have it, but let
Heinrich plant the detonators

412
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:42,950
and Theo prepare the vault.
After we call the police,

413
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:46,250
you can tear the building apart
looking for this man

414
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:49,150
but until then,
do not alter the plan!

415
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:51,850
<i>And if he alters it?</i>

416
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:58,650
What do you think?

417
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:02,650
Something's wrong.

418
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:04,150
Cops?

419
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:08,450
- John.
- John?

420
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:10,950
He can fuck this whole thing up.

421
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:12,350
What does he think he's doing?

422
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:13,650
His job.

423
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:17,450
Bullshit.
His job's 3,000 miles away.

424
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:20,750
Without him, we still have
a chance to get out of here.

425
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:24,350
Tell that to Takagi.

426
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,150
Mayday, Mayday,
anyone copying channel nine.

427
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:52,750
<i>Terrorists have seized
the Nakatomi building</i>

428
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:54,250
<i>and are holding
at least 30 people hostage.</i>

429
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:56,450
<i>I repeat.
Unknown number of terrorists</i>

430
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:58,650
six or more
armed with automatic weapons

431
00:43:58,685 --> 00:43:59,850

432
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:00,950
<i>Century City.</i>

433
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:03,850
Where's the best place to transmit?

434
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:04,550
The roof!

435
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:06,050
Go! Go!

436
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:11,250
It's the same address
as that fire signal.

437
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:13,750
I'll handle it.

438
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:17,015
Attention, whoever you are,

439
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:19,650
this channel is reserved
for emergency calls only.

440
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:22,750
<i>No fucking shit, lady!
Do I sound like I'm ordering a pizza?</i>

441
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:38,550
No-one kills him but me.

442
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:41,350
They have already killed one hostage.

443
00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:44,550
They are fortifying their positions
while you're jerkin' me off on the radio!

444
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:46,950
Sir, I've already told you.

445
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:48,650
This is a reserved channel.

446
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:52,550
If this is an emergency call,
dial 911 on your telephone.

447
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:56,250
Otherwise, I'll report this
as an FCC violation.

448
00:44:56,350 --> 00:44:58,850
Fine! Report me!
Come the fuck down here and arrest me!

449
00:44:59,050 --> 00:45:00,250
Just send the police now!

450
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:17,350
See if a black and white can drive by.

451
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:31,150
Thought you guys just ate doughnuts.

452
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:34,550
- They're for my wife.
- Yeah.

453
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:39,350
- She's pregnant.
- Yeah.

454
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:41,350
Bag it.

455
00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:44,250
Big time.

456
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:48,650
Thanks.

457
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:54,050
<i>Dispatch to 8-Lincoln-30. Over.</i>

458
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:56,115
This is 8-Lincoln-30.

<i>Investigate a code two
at Nakatomi Plaza, Century City.</i>

460
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:04,550
8- Lincoln-30 to Dispatch.
I'm on my way.

461
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:03,950
Girls.

462
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:21,750
Shit! Where the fuck is it?

463
00:48:43,850 --> 00:48:45,750
Oh, my God.

464
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:03,850
He's in the elevator shaft.

465
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:05,350
Perfect.

466
00:49:05,450 --> 00:49:07,850
The elevators are locked off.
He can't escape.

467
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:09,650
Just shut him in
and come back down.

468
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:14,750
Oh, fuck.

469
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:23,050
Karl, the police are probably
on their way

470
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:24,050
<i>already.</i>

471
00:49:24,450 --> 00:49:24,950
Karl?

472
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:47,250
Christ.

473
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:54,850
I can stall them,
but not if they hear gunshots.

474
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:57,450
If you lock him in,
he'll be neutralized...

475
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:03,850
"Come out to the coast!"

476
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:06,050
"We'll get together,
have a few laughs. "

477
00:51:13,050 --> 00:51:16,050
Now I know
what a TV dinner feels like.

478
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,550
Such!

479
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:25,750
Karl, komm! Die polizei!

480
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:27,650
Karl, die polizei!

481
00:53:12,550 --> 00:53:14,550
Well, it's about time.

482
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:21,550
No signs of disturbance, Dispatch.

483
00:53:21,650 --> 00:53:24,050
<i>Roger. Possible crank call.</i>

484

<i>Check the area again and confirm.</i>

485
00:53:32,450 --> 00:53:34,650
Who's driving this car,
Stevie Wonder?

486
00:53:36,850 --> 00:53:38,350
I do see a guard inside.

487
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:41,350
I'm gonna go in for a closer look.

488
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:42,750
Use caution.

489
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:46,950
Eddie?

490
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:49,850
I had a feelin' you'd be calling.

491
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:15,850
Evenin', officer.
What can I do for you?

492
00:54:27,350 --> 00:54:29,250
We had that false alarm.

493
00:54:29,350 --> 00:54:31,550
You ask me, that goddamn
computer sent you

494
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:33,515
on another wild-goose chase.

495
00:54:33,550 --> 00:54:37,050
They been chasing bugs in this system
ever since they installed it.

496
00:54:37,150 --> 00:54:39,450
<i>.. Notre Dame on top of USC.</i>

497
00:54:39,550 --> 00:54:41,315
Aw, shit!

498
00:54:41,350 --> 00:54:43,950
I got 50 bucks bet on them assholes.

499
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:49,750
Come on, come on,
where's the fucking cavalry?

500
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:15,650
<i>.. was good for 52 yards.</i>

501
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:17,850
Mind if I look around?

502
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:19,315
Help yourself.

503
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:22,050
<i>27 seconds left in this first period.
Seven to nothing, Notre Dame.</i>

504
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:25,150
<i>The Irish driving 74 yards
in eight plays...</i>

505
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:28,750
I'll put this fuckin'...

506
00:55:29,350 --> 00:55:30,850
Freeze, motherfucker! Drop it!

507
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:32,050
Don't shoot!

508
00:55:32,150 --> 00:55:34,950
- Put the gun down!
- OK! Don't shoot!

509
00:55:35,050 --> 00:55:36,250
Drop that fuckin' gun!

510
00:55:36,550 --> 00:55:37,850
Marco, down!

511
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:56,450
Ah, to hell with this!

512
00:56:05,350 --> 00:56:07,150
You are done!

513
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:10,350
No more table!
Where are you going, pal?

514
00:56:11,450 --> 00:56:12,950
Next time you have a chance
to kill someone,

515
00:56:13,050 --> 00:56:14,650
don't hesitate.

516
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:23,950
Thanks for the advice.

517
00:56:24,350 --> 00:56:27,750
- Sorry to waste your time.
- No problem at all.

518
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:30,450
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas to you.

519
00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:39,850
Oh, the weather outside is frightful

520
00:56:39,950 --> 00:56:42,350
Dum de dum delightful

521
00:56:44,850 --> 00:56:46,650
Oh, for the love...

522
00:56:50,150 --> 00:56:51,950
8- Lincoln-30 to Dispatch.

523
00:56:52,050 --> 00:56:53,050
<i>Go ahead.</i>

524
00:56:53,150 --> 00:56:55,650
A wild-goose chase
over here at Nakatomi Plaza.

525
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:57,650
Everything here's OK. Over.

526
00:56:58,650 --> 00:57:01,450
But nobody has no place to go

527
00:57:01,550 --> 00:57:04,750
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

528
00:57:06,450 --> 00:57:07,350
Shit!

529
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:09,250
Goddamn it! Jesus H Christ!

530
00:57:17,250 --> 00:57:19,050
Welcome to the party, pal!

531
00:57:19,085 --> 00:57:20,550
Goddamn it!

532
00:57:27,450 --> 00:57:29,450
Get someone here now, goddamn it!

533
00:57:29,550 --> 00:57:32,050
Policeman under automatic
rifle fire at Nakatomi!

534
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:34,150
I need backup assistance now!

535
00:57:35,550 --> 00:57:36,850
Now, goddamn it! Now!

536
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:57,350
Monica, I can get us a table.

537
00:57:58,550 --> 00:58:01,050
Wolfgang and I
are very close friends.

538
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:03,250
I interviewed him, for God's sake.

539
00:58:03,350 --> 00:58:05,050
<i>.. Nakatomi.</i>

540
00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:07,850
<i>Repeat.
Officer needs assistance at...</i>

541
00:58:07,950 --> 00:58:09,350
<i>I'm at Nakatomi Plaza.</i>

542
00:58:09,450 --> 00:58:11,650
<i>They're turning my car
into Swiss cheese!</i>

543
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:13,350
<i>I need backup assistance now!</i>

544
00:58:13,550 --> 00:58:15,750
<i>Now, goddamn it! Now!</i>

545
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:38,650
Never thought
I'd love to hear that sound.

546
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:40,350
All of you relax.

547
00:58:40,450 --> 00:58:43,350
This is a matter
of inconvenient timing, that's all.

548
00:58:43,450 --> 00:58:45,350
Police action was inevitable

549
00:58:45,450 --> 00:58:48,150
and, as it happens, necessary.

550
00:58:48,250 --> 00:58:51,750
So, let them fumble about outside
and stay calm.

551
00:58:51,850 --> 00:58:53,450
This is simply the beginning.

552
00:58:55,150 --> 00:58:58,650
I told you all I wanted
radio silence until...

553
00:58:58,750 --> 00:59:01,350
I'm very sorry, Hans.
I didn't get that message.

554
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:04,850
<i>Maybe you should have put it
on the bulletin board.</i>

555
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:07,350
I figured since I waxed Tony
and Marco and his friend here,

556
00:59:07,550 --> 00:59:10,350
I figured you and Karl
and Franco might be lonely

557
00:59:10,385 --> 00:59:12,350
so I wanted to give you a call.

558
00:59:12,450 --> 00:59:14,650
How does he know
so much about us?

559
00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:18,150
That's very kind of you.

560
00:59:18,650 --> 00:59:21,650
<i>I assume you are
our mysterious party crasher.</i>

561
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:23,750
<i>You are most troublesome</i>

562
00:59:23,850 --> 00:59:25,650
for a security guard.

563
00:59:26,050 --> 00:59:28,850
Eeeh! Sorry, Hans. Wrong guess.

564
00:59:28,950 --> 00:59:31,650
<i>Would you like to go for double jeopardy
where the scores can really change?</i>

565
00:59:36,850 --> 00:59:39,150
Mm, these are very bad for you.

566
00:59:40,050 --> 00:59:41,550
Who are you, then?

567
00:59:41,650 --> 00:59:43,950
Just the fly in the ointment, Hans.

568
00:59:44,050 --> 00:59:45,350
The monkey in the wrench,

569
00:59:45,450 --> 00:59:47,450
the pain in the ass.

570
00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:50,950
Whoa!

571
00:59:52,650 --> 00:59:55,050
Check on all the others.
Don't use the radio.

572
00:59:55,150 --> 00:59:56,550
See if he's lying about Marco

573
00:59:56,650 --> 00:59:59,250
and find out
if anyone else is missing.

574
01:00:02,950 --> 01:00:05,050
Mr Mystery Guest,

575
01:00:06,150 --> 01:00:07,850
<i>are you still there?</i>

576
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:10,250
Yeah, I'm still here

577
01:00:10,350 --> 01:00:13,050
unless you want to open
the front door for me.

578
01:00:13,150 --> 01:00:15,050
<i>No, I'm afraid not</i>

579
01:00:15,150 --> 01:00:17,950
but you have me at a loss.

580
01:00:18,050 --> 01:00:19,815
You know my name, but who are you?

581
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:24,050
<i>Just another American
who saw too many movies as a child?</i>

582
01:00:24,150 --> 01:00:27,250
<i>Another orphan
of a bankrupt culture</i>

583
01:00:27,450 --> 01:00:30,550
<i>who thinks he's John Wayne,
Rambo, Marshal Dillon?</i>

584
01:00:31,850 --> 01:00:34,750
I was always partial
to Roy Rogers, actually.

585
01:00:35,350 --> 01:00:37,150
I liked those sequined shirts.

586
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:40,450
Do you really think you have
a chance against us, Mr Cowboy?

587
01:00:43,650 --> 01:00:45,750
Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker.

588
01:00:49,550 --> 01:00:51,850
I'll beat everyone if I get a remote.

589
01:00:51,885 --> 01:00:53,650
Sam, I don't have the new pages.

590
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:56,050
Harvey, keep your pants on.

591
01:00:56,085 --> 01:00:57,850
Sam, I'm begging you.

592
01:00:57,950 --> 01:01:01,150
Simon's with the remote.
I'll tell him to swing by.

593
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:03,050
I won't sit on this!

594
01:01:03,150 --> 01:01:05,950
This is my story!
I'm going out there!

595
01:01:06,050 --> 01:01:07,650
Look, Sam. Tell you what.

596
01:01:07,750 --> 01:01:09,950
You don't give me a truck,
I'll steal a truck.

597
01:01:10,050 --> 01:01:11,150
Give us a break, Thornburg.

598
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:12,450
Eat it, Harvey!

599
01:01:12,550 --> 01:01:15,150
.. four, three, two,

600
01:01:15,185 --> 01:01:16,350
one.

601
01:01:16,650 --> 01:01:18,350
Harvey, we're on the air.

602
01:01:22,650 --> 01:01:24,750
Good evening.
This is Harvey Johnson.

603
01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:28,315
And I'm Gail Wallens.

604
01:01:28,350 --> 01:01:30,350
This is Nightline News at 10.00.

605
01:01:30,550 --> 01:01:33,250
Our top stories
on this Christmas Eve...

606
01:01:33,350 --> 01:01:36,550
Take truck number five.
Get out of here.

607
01:01:44,350 --> 01:01:47,250
He wasn't lying about Marco.
He's down on the street.

608
01:01:47,850 --> 01:01:49,750
The other man was Heinrich

609
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:52,050
and his bag is missing.

610
01:01:54,250 --> 01:01:55,750
He had the detonator.

611
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:01,550
Theo.

612
01:02:02,350 --> 01:02:03,350
<i>Theo.</i>

613
01:02:03,550 --> 01:02:04,650
Yo!

614
01:02:05,050 --> 01:02:08,250
<i>We may have some problems.
How's our schedule?</i>

615
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:10,250
Three down, four to go.

616
01:02:10,350 --> 01:02:11,850
<i>Then don't waste time</i>

617
01:02:11,950 --> 01:02:13,750
talking to me.

618
01:02:14,450 --> 01:02:15,950
<i>This is Sergeant Al Powell</i>

619
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:17,750
of the Los Angeles
Police Department.

620
01:02:17,850 --> 01:02:19,250
If the person who radioed for help

621
01:02:19,350 --> 01:02:20,450
<i>can hear me on this channel,</i>

622
01:02:20,650 --> 01:02:22,550
<i>acknowledge this transmission.</i>

623
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:23,715
<i>I say again,</i>

624
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:27,150
if the person who radioed
for help can hear me,

625
01:02:27,185 --> 01:02:29,650
acknowledge this transmission!

626
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:36,550
I read you, pal.
You the guy in the car?

627
01:02:36,650 --> 01:02:38,650
What's left of him.

628
01:02:38,750 --> 01:02:40,350
<i>Can you identify yourself?</i>

629
01:02:40,450 --> 01:02:42,150
Not now. Maybe later.

630
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:44,250
Listen fast. This is a party line.

631
01:02:44,350 --> 01:02:46,350
The neighbors got itchy trigger fingers.

632
01:02:46,450 --> 01:02:47,950
All right, here's the deal.

633
01:02:48,050 --> 01:02:49,850
You got 30 or so hostages
on the 30th floor.

634
01:02:49,950 --> 01:02:51,350
<i>The leader's name is Hans.</i>

635
01:02:51,450 --> 01:02:52,950
We have to find him and shut him up.

636
01:02:53,050 --> 01:02:54,150
He's telling them everything!

637
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:56,250
Let him. I'm waiting for the FBI.

638
01:02:56,350 --> 01:02:58,450
He can waste
as much time as he likes

639
01:02:58,550 --> 01:03:00,850
but we must find the bag, Fritz.

640
01:03:00,950 --> 01:03:02,950
<i>They have a freakin' arsenal here.</i>

641
01:03:03,050 --> 01:03:04,350
We must have the detonators.

642
01:03:04,450 --> 01:03:06,950
<i>They got missiles, automatic weapons,</i>

643
01:03:07,050 --> 01:03:09,150
<i>and enough plastic explosives
to orbit Arnold Schwarzenegger.</i>

644
01:03:09,650 --> 01:03:12,450
They're down to nine now,
counting the skydiver you met.

645
01:03:12,550 --> 01:03:14,350
These guys are mostly European

646
01:03:14,450 --> 01:03:16,950
judging by their clothing labels and

647
01:03:23,850 --> 01:03:25,350
cigarettes.

648
01:03:25,450 --> 01:03:28,050
They're well-financed and very slick.

649
01:03:28,085 --> 01:03:29,750
How do you know that?

650
01:03:29,850 --> 01:03:31,615
<i>I've seen enough phony IDs in my time</i>

651
01:03:31,650 --> 01:03:35,450
to recognize the ones they got
must have cost a fortune.

652
01:03:37,850 --> 01:03:40,250
Add all that up. I don't know
what the fuck it means

653
01:03:40,285 --> 01:03:42,350
but you got
some bad-ass perpetrators

654
01:03:42,450 --> 01:03:43,850
and they're here to stay.

655
01:03:45,450 --> 01:03:46,950
I hear you, partner.

656
01:03:47,050 --> 01:03:48,250
LA's finest are on it,

657
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:49,950
<i>so light 'em if you got 'em.</i>

658
01:03:50,550 --> 01:03:53,350
Way ahead of you, partner.

659
01:03:53,850 --> 01:03:55,850
<i>So what do I call you?</i>

660
01:03:57,450 --> 01:03:58,650
Call me...

661
01:04:00,450 --> 01:04:01,350
Roy.

662
01:04:01,450 --> 01:04:05,150
Listen up, Roy,
if you think of anything else,

663
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:06,415
don't be shy, OK?

664
01:04:06,450 --> 01:04:09,550
In the meantime, find a safe place
and let us do our job.

665
01:04:10,550 --> 01:04:12,850
<i>They're all yours, Al.</i>

666
01:04:30,350 --> 01:04:31,650
Who's talking to 'em?

667
01:04:32,650 --> 01:04:35,750
I am, sir.
Sergeant Powell. Al Powell.

668
01:04:36,150 --> 01:04:38,150
Dwayne Robinson. What's the deal?

669
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:40,150
What do these pricks want?

670
01:04:40,250 --> 01:04:42,350
If you mean the terrorists,

671
01:04:42,450 --> 01:04:44,550
we haven't heard a peep from them.

672
01:04:44,650 --> 01:04:46,450
Who have you been talking to?

673
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:50,350
We don't know.
He won't give us his name.

674
01:04:50,450 --> 01:04:53,150
But he appears to be
the one who phoned.

675
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:56,450
He's killed one terrorist for sure
and claims he capped off two others.

676
01:04:56,550 --> 01:04:57,750
He claims?

677
01:04:57,850 --> 01:05:00,050
Powell, has it occurred to you

678
01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:02,550
he could be
one of the terrorists pulling your chain

679
01:05:02,585 --> 01:05:04,350
or some nutcase in there?

680
01:05:04,450 --> 01:05:07,400
I don't think so.
In fact, I think he's a cop,

681
01:05:07,435 --> 01:05:10,350
maybe not LAPD,
But he's definitely a badge.

682
01:05:10,450 --> 01:05:13,750
- How do you know that?
- A hunch... things he said

683
01:05:13,850 --> 01:05:16,550
like being able to spot a phony ID.

684
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:18,750
Jesus Christ, Powell!

685
01:05:18,850 --> 01:05:21,350
He could be a fucking bartender
for all we know!

686
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:22,950
TV's here.

687
01:05:23,950 --> 01:05:25,550
Oh, shit.

688
01:05:42,550 --> 01:05:44,050
I have a request.

689
01:05:44,150 --> 01:05:46,950
What idiot put you in charge?

690
01:05:47,050 --> 01:05:48,515
You did

691
01:05:48,550 --> 01:05:50,700
when you murdered my boss.

692
01:05:50,735 --> 01:05:52,850
Now everybody's looking to me.

693
01:05:52,950 --> 01:05:55,515
Personally, I'd pass on the job.

694
01:05:55,550 --> 01:05:58,950
I don't enjoy being this close to you.

695
01:06:06,950 --> 01:06:08,250
Go on.

696
01:06:08,350 --> 01:06:10,350
We have a pregnant woman.

697
01:06:10,450 --> 01:06:13,350
Relax. She's not due
for a couple weeks

698
01:06:13,450 --> 01:06:16,550
but sitting on that rock
isn't doing her back any good.

699
01:06:16,650 --> 01:06:20,050
So I'd like permission to move her
to an office with a sofa.

700
01:06:21,450 --> 01:06:24,350
No, but I'll have a sofa
brought out. Good enough?

701
01:06:24,450 --> 01:06:25,850
Good enough.

702
01:06:26,450 --> 01:06:27,950
And unless you like it messy,

703
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:30,250
start bringing us
in groups to the bathroom.

704
01:06:30,350 --> 01:06:33,450
Yes. You're right.

705
01:06:34,350 --> 01:06:36,050
It will be done.

706
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:37,650
Was there something else?

707
01:06:40,250 --> 01:06:41,850
No, thank you.

708
01:06:48,350 --> 01:06:51,150
Mr Takagi
chose his people well, Mrs...?

709
01:06:52,050 --> 01:06:53,050
Gennero.

710
01:06:54,850 --> 01:06:57,450
Ms Gennero.

711
01:07:00,050 --> 01:07:02,650
<i>We interrupt this program
for a special news bulletin.</i>

712
01:07:02,850 --> 01:07:05,650
<i>This is Richard Thornburg
live from Century City.</i>

713
01:07:05,850 --> 01:07:08,850
<i>Tonight, Los Angeles has joined</i>

714
01:07:08,950 --> 01:07:12,050
<i>the sad and worldwide
fraternity of cities</i>

715
01:07:12,085 --> 01:07:14,050
<i>whose only membership requirement</i>

716
01:07:14,150 --> 01:07:17,250
<i>is to suffer the anguish
of international terrorism.</i>

717
01:07:17,350 --> 01:07:21,750
<i>Approximately two hours ago,
an unidentified group of men</i>

718
01:07:21,850 --> 01:07:24,450
<i>seized control
of the Nakatomi building,</i>

719
01:07:24,550 --> 01:07:26,700
<i>sealing off all entrances and exits.</i>

720
01:07:26,735 --> 01:07:28,815
<i>All telephone lines have been cut</i>

721
01:07:28,850 --> 01:07:31,150
<i>and the only communication
now possible</i>

722
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:34,150
<i>has been through the use
of CB communicators</i>

723
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:36,650
<i>which the group
apparently brought with them.</i>

724
01:07:36,750 --> 01:07:38,515
<i>According to official sources,</i>

725
01:07:38,550 --> 01:07:41,250
<i>the perpetrators of this building siege...</i>

726
01:07:41,350 --> 01:07:44,050
<i>Unit five,
hold your position in the main entrance.</i>

727
01:07:44,150 --> 01:07:46,750
We got Charlie unit in position

728
01:07:46,850 --> 01:07:48,350
by the parking structure.

729
01:07:48,450 --> 01:07:50,250
Let me ask you something.

730
01:07:50,350 --> 01:07:52,450
Does this stairway
go up to the escalator?

731
01:07:52,550 --> 01:07:53,750
Yeah.

732
01:07:53,850 --> 01:07:55,550
Tell them to go ahead.

733
01:07:56,350 --> 01:07:57,950
What's going on?

734
01:07:58,750 --> 01:08:00,950
What's it look like? We're going in.

735
01:08:00,985 --> 01:08:03,750
Going in? Man, that's crazy!

736
01:08:03,950 --> 01:08:05,850
There could be over 30 hostages
in there for all we know.

737
01:08:05,950 --> 01:08:07,850
We don't know shit, Powell.

738
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:11,300
If there's hostages, how come
there were no ransom demands?

739
01:08:11,335 --> 01:08:14,650
If there's terrorists in there,
where's their list of demands?

740
01:08:14,750 --> 01:08:16,950
All we know is that
somebody shot your car up.

741
01:08:17,050 --> 01:08:19,150
It's probably the same silly son of a bitch

742
01:08:19,250 --> 01:08:21,350
you've been talking to on that radio.

743
01:08:21,385 --> 01:08:23,050
Excuse me, sir,

744
01:08:23,150 --> 01:08:26,450
but what about the body
that fell out the window?

745
01:08:26,550 --> 01:08:28,350
Probably some stockbroker
got depressed.

746
01:08:28,385 --> 01:08:29,515
We're ready, Chief.

747
01:08:29,550 --> 01:08:31,950
- Light 'em up. Let's go.
- Hit your lights.

748
01:08:32,050 --> 01:08:34,950
- Blue units, go.
- Lights on!

749
01:08:46,950 --> 01:08:47,750
Powell?

750
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:51,950
Powell, you still with me, babe?
What's going on?

751
01:08:52,650 --> 01:08:53,950
Yo, Al.

752
01:08:54,150 --> 01:08:56,650
I'm here, Roy,
but I'm kind of busy right now.

753
01:08:56,750 --> 01:08:57,850
I'll talk to you later.

754
01:08:57,950 --> 01:08:58,915
Al, what's wrong?

755
01:08:58,950 --> 01:09:00,650
<i>I'll talk to you later.</i>

756
01:09:00,750 --> 01:09:02,750
If you are what I think you are,

757
01:09:02,850 --> 01:09:05,350
you'll know when to listen,
shut up, and

758
01:09:06,950 --> 01:09:08,850
and when to pray.

759
01:09:08,950 --> 01:09:11,150
Jesus Christ!
You're coming in, right?

760
01:09:11,250 --> 01:09:12,615
Christ, Powell,

761
01:09:12,650 --> 01:09:14,750
I told you what kind of people
you're dealing with here.

762
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:17,150
Let's load them up.

763
01:09:20,550 --> 01:09:23,050
They'll be coming.
Everyone get ready.

764
01:09:23,950 --> 01:09:26,550
<i>Theo, you are the eyes now.</i>

765
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:40,250
<i>- Rivers.
- Yo.</i>

766
01:09:40,350 --> 01:09:43,150
Begin your reconnoiter.

767
01:09:43,850 --> 01:09:45,150
Let's go.

768
01:09:48,450 --> 01:09:49,950
Shit!

769
01:10:08,950 --> 01:10:11,150
Come on. Let's go.

770
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:22,850
Ow! Jesus!

771
01:10:56,950 --> 01:10:59,350
All right, spread out.

772
01:11:25,350 --> 01:11:26,850
Shut up.

773
01:11:28,650 --> 01:11:30,550
Let's go.

774
01:11:35,250 --> 01:11:37,150
You macho assholes. No! No!

775
01:11:40,150 --> 01:11:42,950
Ahem... all right. Listen up, guys.

776
01:11:44,250 --> 01:11:46,450
'Twas the night before Christmas

777
01:11:46,550 --> 01:11:48,515
<i>and all through the house</i>

778
01:11:48,550 --> 01:11:51,050
<i>not a creature was stirring, except</i>

779
01:11:51,150 --> 01:11:54,150
<i>the four assholes
coming in the rear in standard</i>

780
01:11:54,185 --> 01:11:55,950
two-by-two cover formation.

781
01:11:58,450 --> 01:11:59,650
We're all set.

782
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:02,950
We're ready.

783
01:12:03,150 --> 01:12:04,450
Kick ass.

784
01:12:04,550 --> 01:12:05,650
Go!

785
01:12:05,750 --> 01:12:07,950
Right. Let's do it.

786
01:12:23,350 --> 01:12:24,750
Take cover!

787
01:12:25,250 --> 01:12:26,715
They're shooting at 'em.

788
01:12:26,750 --> 01:12:28,850
It's panic fire.
They can't see anything.

789
01:12:28,950 --> 01:12:30,750
They're shooting at the lights.

790
01:12:35,150 --> 01:12:38,650
They're going after the lights.
Call them back.

791
01:12:39,650 --> 01:12:41,050
It's not happening.

792
01:12:41,150 --> 01:12:42,350
Mike, burn it.

793
01:12:44,550 --> 01:12:46,250
Don't be impatient.

794
01:12:47,150 --> 01:12:48,950
<i>Just wound them.</i>

795
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:53,450
Get them back.
They're sitting ducks without lights.

796
01:12:53,550 --> 01:12:55,350
They're almost in.

797
01:12:55,450 --> 01:12:56,550
Send in the car.

798
01:12:56,650 --> 01:12:58,250
Send in the car.

799
01:13:11,650 --> 01:13:13,050
Jesus Christ!

800
01:13:16,150 --> 01:13:18,850
Rivers, Rodriguez, report.

801
01:13:19,050 --> 01:13:21,850
Wait a minute.
What have we here, gentlemen?

802
01:13:25,950 --> 01:13:28,650
The police have themselves an RV.

803
01:13:33,950 --> 01:13:35,250
Southeast corner.

804
01:13:48,350 --> 01:13:50,250
Oh, Jesus Christ.

805
01:14:02,150 --> 01:14:04,850
Get back! Get the fuck back!

806
01:14:06,650 --> 01:14:07,750
Get over there.

807
01:14:07,850 --> 01:14:09,250
Schnell! Schnell!

808
01:14:09,350 --> 01:14:11,450
Mach schnell!

809
01:14:14,350 --> 01:14:16,250
Weiter! Weiter! Weiter!

810
01:14:16,350 --> 01:14:18,150
Mach schnell! Mach schnell!

811
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:19,450
Weiter!

812
01:14:22,450 --> 01:14:23,950
Mach los! Mach los!

813
01:14:44,050 --> 01:14:44,950
I see him!

814
01:14:56,550 --> 01:14:58,250
- Fire!
- Clear!

815
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:07,250
Oh, my God!
The quarterback is toast!

816
01:15:07,850 --> 01:15:10,450
Hang on, Rivers. That's an order.

817
01:15:11,650 --> 01:15:12,650
Hit it again.

818
01:15:12,750 --> 01:15:15,050
All right, you motherfucker,
you made your point!

819
01:15:15,150 --> 01:15:15,950
Let them pull back!

820
01:15:16,050 --> 01:15:18,550
Thank you, Mr Cowboy.
I'll take it under advisement.

821
01:15:18,650 --> 01:15:19,050
Hit it

822
01:15:19,150 --> 01:15:20,150
<i>again.</i>

823
01:15:34,450 --> 01:15:35,750
Fire.

824
01:15:50,250 --> 01:15:52,250
Fuck me.

825
01:15:52,350 --> 01:15:54,850
Get them out of the car! They're burning!

826
01:16:05,150 --> 01:16:05,750
Fuck it.

827
01:16:08,650 --> 01:16:10,250
Mach schnell! Mach los!

828
01:16:18,150 --> 01:16:21,750
Let's see you take this
under advisement, jerkweed.

829
01:16:25,550 --> 01:16:27,450
Geronimo, motherfucker.

830
01:16:46,250 --> 01:16:47,250
Oh, shit!

831
01:16:52,450 --> 01:16:54,050
They're using artillery on us!

832
01:16:54,150 --> 01:16:56,250
You idiot, it's not the police.

833
01:16:56,850 --> 01:16:58,550
It's him.

834
01:17:06,050 --> 01:17:07,350
Holy shit.

835
01:17:12,650 --> 01:17:14,150
My God!

836
01:17:16,350 --> 01:17:19,250
- Tell me you got that.
- I got it.

837
01:17:20,650 --> 01:17:23,150
Eat your heart out, Channel Five.

838
01:17:23,250 --> 01:17:24,550
<i>We've had an update</i>

839
01:17:24,650 --> 01:17:27,150
<i>on the terrorist takeover
of the Nakatomi building.</i>

840
01:17:27,250 --> 01:17:29,450
<i>Sources say
the terrorist leader, Hans,</i>

841
01:17:29,485 --> 01:17:31,550
<i>may be this man... Hans Gruber.</i>

842
01:17:31,650 --> 01:17:34,550
<i>A member of the radical
West German Volksfrei movement.</i>

843
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:38,450
<i>Strangely, the Volksfrei leadership
issued a communiquÃ© an hour ago</i>

844
01:17:38,550 --> 01:17:41,350
<i>stating that Gruber had been
expelled from that organization.</i>

845
01:17:41,385 --> 01:17:43,450
<i>Al, do you copy?</i>

846
01:17:43,850 --> 01:17:45,250
Are you all right?

847
01:17:46,150 --> 01:17:47,550
Yeah, I'm fine.

848
01:17:48,650 --> 01:17:49,950
W- what was that?

849
01:17:50,150 --> 01:17:52,950
<i>Remember that plastic
explosive I told you about?</i>

850
01:17:53,150 --> 01:17:55,950
There you go.
Is the building on fire?

851
01:17:56,150 --> 01:17:57,850
No, but it's gonna need a paint job

852
01:17:57,950 --> 01:17:59,550
and a shitload of screen doors.

853
01:17:59,650 --> 01:18:02,450
Our spotter said you got two
with that blast.

854
01:18:02,550 --> 01:18:05,050
- Is that him?
- Yes, sir.

855
01:18:06,750 --> 01:18:09,350
I don't know who you think you are

856
01:18:09,450 --> 01:18:11,915
but you just destroyed a building.

857
01:18:11,950 --> 01:18:15,150
<i>We do not want your help.
Is that clear?</i>

858
01:18:15,185 --> 01:18:16,950
<i>We don't want your help.</i>

859
01:18:17,150 --> 01:18:20,150
<i>I've got 100 people down here,
and they're covered with glass.</i>

860
01:18:20,250 --> 01:18:23,150
Glass? Who gives a shit about glass?

861
01:18:23,250 --> 01:18:24,250
Who the fuck is this?

862
01:18:25,850 --> 01:18:28,550
This is Deputy Chief of Police
Dwayne T Robinson

863
01:18:28,585 --> 01:18:30,550
and I am in charge of this situation.

864
01:18:30,650 --> 01:18:32,450
Oh, you're in charge?

865
01:18:32,550 --> 01:18:34,515
I got some bad news for you, Dwayne.

866
01:18:34,550 --> 01:18:37,850
<i>From up here it doesn't look
like you're in charge of shit.</i>

867
01:18:37,950 --> 01:18:40,050
Listen to me, you little asshole...

868
01:18:40,150 --> 01:18:40,950
<i>Asshole?</i>

869
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:42,850
I'm not the one
who just got buttfucked

870
01:18:42,950 --> 01:18:44,750
<i>on national TV, Dwayne.</i>

871
01:18:44,850 --> 01:18:46,150
Ah ha ha!

872
01:18:46,250 --> 01:18:48,050
<i>Listen to me, jerk-off,</i>

873
01:18:48,150 --> 01:18:51,150
<i>if you're not part of the solution,
you're part of the problem.</i>

874
01:18:51,250 --> 01:18:54,350
<i>Quit being part of the problem
and put the other guy back on!</i>

875
01:18:57,150 --> 01:18:58,850
Hey, Roy, how you feeling?

876
01:18:58,950 --> 01:19:00,950
Pretty fucking unappreciated, Al.

877
01:19:01,050 --> 01:19:03,315
<i>Hey, look. I love you.</i>

878
01:19:03,350 --> 01:19:05,650
<i>So do a lot of the other guys.</i>

879
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:08,350
So hang in there, man, you hear me?

880
01:19:08,450 --> 01:19:10,350
You hang in there.

881
01:19:11,950 --> 01:19:14,450
Yeah, thanks, partner.

882
01:19:20,350 --> 01:19:21,650
What are you doing?

883
01:19:21,750 --> 01:19:23,015
I'm tired of sitting here

884
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:25,250
waiting to see
who gets us killed first,

885
01:19:25,285 --> 01:19:26,750
them or your husband.

886
01:19:27,250 --> 01:19:28,850
What are you going to do?

887
01:19:28,885 --> 01:19:29,750
Hey, babe,

888
01:19:29,850 --> 01:19:31,650
I negotiate million-dollar deals
for breakfast.

889
01:19:31,750 --> 01:19:33,650
I think I can handle this Eurotrash.

890
01:19:34,450 --> 01:19:37,250
Hey, sprechen sie talk, huh?

891
01:19:37,350 --> 01:19:40,250
If you'd listened to me,
he would be neutralized already.

892
01:19:40,350 --> 01:19:42,050
I don't want neutral. I want dead.

893
01:19:43,450 --> 01:19:45,450
Hope I'm not interrupting.

894
01:19:45,485 --> 01:19:46,450
What does he want?

895
01:19:46,650 --> 01:19:50,250
<i>It's not what I want.
It's what I can give you.</i>

896
01:19:57,650 --> 01:20:00,015
Look, let's be straight, OK?

897
01:20:00,050 --> 01:20:02,650
It's obvious you're not
some dumb schmuck

898
01:20:02,750 --> 01:20:04,750
up here to snatch a few purses.

899
01:20:04,850 --> 01:20:06,450
You're very perceptive.

900
01:20:06,550 --> 01:20:08,215
<i>I watch 60 Minutes.</i>

901
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:10,950
I say to myself,
these guys are professional,

902
01:20:11,050 --> 01:20:13,450
they're motivated, they're happening,

903
01:20:13,550 --> 01:20:15,150
they want something.

904
01:20:15,250 --> 01:20:18,050
I couldn't care less
about your politics.

905
01:20:18,250 --> 01:20:20,350
Maybe you're pissed off
at the camel jockeys.

906
01:20:20,450 --> 01:20:21,950
Maybe it's the Hebes,
Northern Ireland.

907
01:20:22,050 --> 01:20:23,415
It's none of my business.

908
01:20:23,450 --> 01:20:25,850
I figure you're here
to negotiate, am I right?

909
01:20:25,885 --> 01:20:27,015
You're amazing.

910
01:20:27,050 --> 01:20:29,450
You figured this all out already?

911
01:20:29,550 --> 01:20:31,650
Hey, business is business.

912
01:20:31,750 --> 01:20:33,650
You use a gun,
I use a fountain pen.

913
01:20:33,750 --> 01:20:34,950
What's the difference?

914
01:20:35,050 --> 01:20:36,150
Let's put it in my terms.

915
01:20:36,250 --> 01:20:37,650
You're here on a hostile takeover.

916
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:38,950
You grab us for some green

917
01:20:39,050 --> 01:20:42,350
but you didn't expect some poison pill
was gonna be running around the building.

918
01:20:42,450 --> 01:20:43,250
Am I right?

919
01:20:43,850 --> 01:20:44,850
Hans,

920
01:20:45,450 --> 01:20:46,550
bubbie...

921
01:20:47,050 --> 01:20:48,850
I'm your white knight.

922
01:20:49,950 --> 01:20:52,650
<i>I must have missed 60 Minutes.</i>

923
01:20:52,750 --> 01:20:53,750
What are you saying?

924
01:20:56,150 --> 01:20:59,350
The guy upstairs
who's fucking things up, huh?

925
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:05,750
I can give him to you.

926
01:21:08,350 --> 01:21:10,450
<i>Oh, God...</i>

927
01:21:12,550 --> 01:21:14,950
Roy? Roy, you all right?

928
01:21:16,150 --> 01:21:19,250
Just trying to fire down
a 1,000-year-old Twinkie.

929
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:21,750
What do they put in these things,

930
01:21:21,785 --> 01:21:22,650
<i>anyway?</i>

931
01:21:23,150 --> 01:21:24,950
Sugar, enriched flour,

932
01:21:25,050 --> 01:21:27,050
partially hydrogenated
vegetable oil,

933
01:21:27,250 --> 01:21:28,650
polysorbate 60,

934
01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:30,450
<i>and yellow dye number five.</i>

935
01:21:30,550 --> 01:21:33,450
<i>Just everything
a growing boy needs.</i>

936
01:21:34,050 --> 01:21:35,915
How many kids you got, Al?

937
01:21:35,950 --> 01:21:40,050
<i>As a matter of fact,
my wife is working on our first.</i>

938
01:21:40,150 --> 01:21:41,750
How about you, cowboy?

939
01:21:41,850 --> 01:21:44,350
You got any kids
back on your ranch?

940
01:21:45,550 --> 01:21:46,750
Yeah.

941
01:21:47,350 --> 01:21:48,150
Two.

942
01:21:48,850 --> 01:21:50,550
Sure hope I can see them

943
01:21:50,650 --> 01:21:52,950
swinging on a jungle gym
with Al Jnr someday.

944
01:21:55,450 --> 01:21:57,250
<i>Well, now, that's a date</i>

945
01:21:57,350 --> 01:21:59,450
<i>but you bring the ice cream.</i>

946
01:21:59,950 --> 01:22:02,150
<i>Touching, cowboy. Touching.</i>

947
01:22:03,050 --> 01:22:04,350
<i>Or should I call you</i>

948
01:22:04,450 --> 01:22:06,550
Mr McClane?

949
01:22:07,950 --> 01:22:10,550
Mr Officer John McClane

950
01:22:10,650 --> 01:22:13,350
<i>of the New York
Police Department?</i>

951
01:22:14,950 --> 01:22:17,150
Get on the phone to Harry in New York.

952
01:22:17,250 --> 01:22:19,550
You better get a hold of somebody
at Dispatch.

953
01:22:19,650 --> 01:22:23,050
Sister Theresa called me
Mr McClane in the third grade.

954
01:22:23,150 --> 01:22:25,715
My friends call me John

955
01:22:25,750 --> 01:22:28,550
and you're neither, shithead.

956
01:22:28,650 --> 01:22:32,350
I have someone
who wants to talk to you.

957
01:22:32,450 --> 01:22:35,150
A very special friend

958
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:37,850
<i>who was with you
at the party tonight.</i>

959
01:22:43,850 --> 01:22:45,950
Hey, John boy.

960
01:22:47,250 --> 01:22:48,650
Ellis?

961
01:22:48,950 --> 01:22:50,250
<i>Yeah.</i>

962
01:22:50,350 --> 01:22:54,350
<i>Listen, John, they're giving me
a few minutes to talk sense into you.</i>

963
01:22:54,450 --> 01:22:57,450
I know you think you're doing your job
and I can appreciate that

964
01:22:57,550 --> 01:22:59,250
<i>but you're just dragging
this thing out.</i>

965
01:22:59,350 --> 01:23:02,350
<i>Look, no-one gets out of here
until these guys</i>

966
01:23:02,450 --> 01:23:04,150
can talk to the LA Police.

967
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:07,650
That won't happen until you stop
messing up the works. Capisce?

968
01:23:13,150 --> 01:23:14,950
Ellis, what have you told them?

969
01:23:15,050 --> 01:23:19,050
I told them we were old friends
and you were my guest

970
01:23:19,150 --> 01:23:20,650
<i>at the party.</i>

971
01:23:21,650 --> 01:23:23,650
Ellis, you shouldn't be doing this.

972
01:23:23,750 --> 01:23:24,950
Tell me about it.

973
01:23:31,650 --> 01:23:33,350
All right, John, listen.

974
01:23:33,450 --> 01:23:36,650
<i>They want you to tell them
where the detonators are.</i>

975
01:23:36,685 --> 01:23:38,950
<i>They know people are listening.</i>

976
01:23:39,050 --> 01:23:42,950
<i>They want the detonators,
or they're gonna kill me.</i>

977
01:23:46,550 --> 01:23:47,950
John, didn't you hear me?

978
01:23:50,450 --> 01:23:52,350
Yeah, I hear you.

979
01:23:52,450 --> 01:23:54,250
John, get with the program.

980
01:23:54,350 --> 01:23:56,950
The police are here now.
It's their problem.

981
01:23:57,050 --> 01:23:59,550
Tell these guys where the detonators are
so no-one else gets hurt!

982
01:23:59,650 --> 01:24:02,650
I'm putting my life
on the line for you, pal!

983
01:24:02,750 --> 01:24:04,950
<i>Ellis, listen to me carefully.</i>

984
01:24:05,050 --> 01:24:05,415
John...

985
01:24:05,450 --> 01:24:07,450
Shut up, Ellis!
Just shut your mouth!

986
01:24:08,250 --> 01:24:09,650
Put Hans back on the line.

987
01:24:09,750 --> 01:24:14,350
<i>Hans, this shithead doesn't know
what kind of man you are but I do.</i>

988
01:24:14,450 --> 01:24:16,450
Good. Then you'll
give us what we want

989
01:24:16,550 --> 01:24:17,850
and save your friend's life.

990
01:24:17,950 --> 01:24:20,150
You're not part of this equation.

991
01:24:20,250 --> 01:24:22,550
Hey, what am I, a method actor?

992
01:24:22,650 --> 01:24:24,150
<i>Babe, put away the gun.</i>

993
01:24:24,350 --> 01:24:25,950
<i>This is radio, not television.</i>

994
01:24:26,050 --> 01:24:28,115
Hans, this asshole is not my friend!

995
01:24:28,150 --> 01:24:29,650
I just met him tonight!
I don't know him!

996
01:24:29,750 --> 01:24:31,750
Jesus Christ, Ellis!
These people will kill you!

997
01:24:31,850 --> 01:24:33,750
Tell them you don't know me!

998
01:24:34,850 --> 01:24:37,350
<i>How can you say that
after all these years?</i>

999
01:24:37,385 --> 01:24:40,950
John? John?

1000
01:25:04,650 --> 01:25:05,850
Do you hear that?

1001
01:25:06,650 --> 01:25:09,050
Talk to me!
Where are my detonators?

1002
01:25:09,450 --> 01:25:12,050
Where are they,
or shall I shoot another one?

1003
01:25:12,150 --> 01:25:13,350
<i>Sooner or later</i>

1004
01:25:13,450 --> 01:25:16,050
<i>I might get to someone
you do care about.</i>

1005
01:25:16,650 --> 01:25:19,250
Go fuck yourself, Hans.

1006
01:25:20,450 --> 01:25:22,550
He just let the guy die.

1007
01:25:22,650 --> 01:25:24,650
He just gave him up.
Give me that headset.

1008
01:25:24,750 --> 01:25:26,850
That's like pulling the trigger yourself.

1009
01:25:26,950 --> 01:25:30,650
Can't you see what's happening?
Can't you read between the lines?

1010
01:25:30,685 --> 01:25:32,950
He did everything he could
to save him.

1011
01:25:33,050 --> 01:25:36,150
If he gave himself up,
they'd both be dead right now!

1012
01:25:36,250 --> 01:25:38,950
No way, man. They'd be talking to us.

1013
01:25:39,050 --> 01:25:42,550
<i>You tell this partner of yours
to stay out of this from now on.</i>

1014
01:25:42,650 --> 01:25:45,650
Because if he doesn't,
I'm really going to nail his ass.

1015
01:25:45,750 --> 01:25:47,650
The man is hurting.

1016
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:49,350
He is alone, tired,

1017
01:25:49,450 --> 01:25:53,150
and he hasn't seen diddly-squat
from anybody here!

1018
01:25:53,250 --> 01:25:55,750
You're gonna tell me he'll give a damn

1019
01:25:55,850 --> 01:25:58,950
about what you do to him
if he makes it out of there alive?

1020
01:25:59,050 --> 01:26:01,950
Why don't you wake up
and smell what you're shoveling?

1021
01:26:02,050 --> 01:26:03,650
You listen to me, sergeant.

1022
01:26:03,750 --> 01:26:07,250
Any time you want to go home,
you consider yourself dismissed.

1023
01:26:07,350 --> 01:26:10,650
No, sir.
You couldn't drag me away.

1024
01:26:10,750 --> 01:26:12,650
<i>Attention, police.</i>

1025
01:26:13,750 --> 01:26:15,850
<i>Attention, police.</i>

1026
01:26:15,950 --> 01:26:19,050
- This is Sergeant Al Powell...
- Give me that.

1027
01:26:19,350 --> 01:26:21,650
This is Deputy Chief Dwayne Robinson.

1028
01:26:21,750 --> 01:26:22,650
Who is this?

1029
01:26:22,750 --> 01:26:24,250
This is Hans Gruber.

1030
01:26:25,550 --> 01:26:29,050
I assume you realize the futility
of direct action against me.

1031
01:26:29,150 --> 01:26:31,050
We have no wish
for further loss of life.

1032
01:26:31,150 --> 01:26:34,150
What is it you do wish for?

1033
01:26:34,250 --> 01:26:38,550
I have comrades in arms
around the world languishing in prison.

1034
01:26:38,650 --> 01:26:42,350
The American State Department
enjoys rattling its saber for its own ends.

1035
01:26:42,385 --> 01:26:44,450
Now it can rattle it for me.

1036
01:26:45,850 --> 01:26:49,550
The following people
are to be released from their captors.

1037
01:26:50,150 --> 01:26:53,250
In Northern Ireland the seven members
of the New Provo Front.

1038
01:26:53,350 --> 01:26:57,950
<i>In Canada, the five imprisoned leaders
of Liberté du Quebec.</i>

1039
01:26:58,050 --> 01:27:01,950
<i>In Sri Lanka, the nine members
of the Asian Dawn.</i>

1040
01:27:02,150 --> 01:27:03,550
What the fuck?

1041
01:27:03,750 --> 01:27:05,550
Asian Dawn?

1042
01:27:05,650 --> 01:27:08,050
<i>I read about them in Time magazine.</i>

1043
01:27:08,150 --> 01:27:11,750
When these revolutionary
brothers and sisters are free,

1044
01:27:11,785 --> 01:27:15,350
the hostages in this building
will be taken to the roof

1045
01:27:15,550 --> 01:27:17,850
and they will accompany us
in helicopters

1046
01:27:17,950 --> 01:27:20,150
to the Los Angeles
International Airport

1047
01:27:20,250 --> 01:27:22,850
where they will be given
further instructions.

1048
01:27:22,950 --> 01:27:24,850
You have two hours to comply.

1049
01:27:24,950 --> 01:27:28,350
Wait a minute. Uh, Mr. Gruber.
This is crazy.

1050
01:27:28,450 --> 01:27:32,150
I don't have the authority.
Two hours is not enough.

1051
01:27:32,250 --> 01:27:34,650
Hello? Hello!

1052
01:27:36,650 --> 01:27:39,850
Did you get all that?
We got to make some calls.

1053
01:27:39,950 --> 01:27:42,050
Do you think they'll even try?

1054
01:27:42,150 --> 01:27:43,850
Who cares?

1055
01:27:46,550 --> 01:27:48,750
Theo, are we on schedule?

1056
01:27:48,850 --> 01:27:50,750
One more to go, then it's up to you.

1057
01:27:50,850 --> 01:27:54,250
You better be right
because the last one will take a miracle.

1058
01:27:54,350 --> 01:27:55,850
It's Christmas, Theo.

1059
01:27:55,950 --> 01:27:58,550
It's the time of miracles,
so be of good cheer

1060
01:27:58,650 --> 01:28:01,350
and call me
when you hit the last lock.

1061
01:28:02,050 --> 01:28:03,150
Karl,

1062
01:28:03,250 --> 01:28:06,850
hunt that little shit down
and get those detonators.

1063
01:28:07,050 --> 01:28:09,050
Fritz is checking the explosives.

1064
01:28:09,250 --> 01:28:11,850
I'll check the explosives.
You just get the detonators.

1065
01:28:11,950 --> 01:28:14,250
Hey, Powell, you out there?

1066
01:28:14,350 --> 01:28:17,050
I'm here, John. I'm here.

1067
01:28:17,650 --> 01:28:21,050
You gotta believe me.
There was nothing I could do.

1068
01:28:21,150 --> 01:28:24,750
Well, it's gonna be
both our asses if you're wrong.

1069
01:28:25,250 --> 01:28:26,850
I hear you.

1070
01:28:32,750 --> 01:28:35,150
Did you catch that bullshit
Hans was running?

1071
01:28:35,250 --> 01:28:37,750
<i>It doesn't make sense, man.</i>

1072
01:28:39,150 --> 01:28:40,450
Hey, don't ask me, man.

1073
01:28:40,550 --> 01:28:43,050
I'm just a desk jockey
who was on my way home when you rang.

1074
01:28:43,250 --> 01:28:46,850
The way you drove that car
I figured you for the street, Al.

1075
01:28:46,950 --> 01:28:49,850
<i>In my youth. In my youth.</i>

<i>Well, Gail,</i>

1081
01:28:59,750 --> 01:29:02,250
by this time,
the hostages should be going through

1082
01:29:02,350 --> 01:29:04,650
the early stages
of the Helsinki Syndrome.

1083
01:29:04,750 --> 01:29:06,650
As in Helsinki, Sweden.

1084
01:29:06,685 --> 01:29:08,250
Finland.

1085
01:29:08,350 --> 01:29:11,950
Basically, it's when the hostages
and the terrorists

1086
01:29:12,050 --> 01:29:14,650
go through a sort of
psychological transference

1087
01:29:14,750 --> 01:29:16,850
and a projection of dependency.

1088

<i>A strange sort of trust
and bond develops.</i>

1089

<i>We've had situations
where the hostages</i>

1090
01:29:22,550 --> 01:29:24,950
<i>have embraced their captors
after release</i>

1091
01:29:24,985 --> 01:29:27,350
<i>and even corresponded with them
in prison.</i>

1092
01:29:27,550 --> 01:29:30,350
No, no, darling. Asian Dawn. Dawn.

D- A-W-N.

Sir, the FBI is here.

1096
01:29:36,950 --> 01:29:40,750
- The FBI is here now?
- Yes, sir. Right over there.

1097
01:29:40,850 --> 01:29:41,950
Hold this.

1098
01:29:42,250 --> 01:29:44,550
Want a breath mint?

1099
01:29:48,650 --> 01:29:50,550
Hey, how you doing, man?

1100
01:29:51,050 --> 01:29:53,750
I'm Agent Johnson.
This is Special Agent Johnson.

1101
01:29:53,785 --> 01:29:57,150
- Oh, how you doing?
- No relation.

1102
01:29:57,185 --> 01:29:58,550
I'm, uh...

1103
01:29:59,950 --> 01:30:02,950
I'm Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.
I'm in charge here.

1104
01:30:03,850 --> 01:30:05,950
Not any more.

1105
01:31:00,650 --> 01:31:04,150
Hi, there. How you doing?

1106
01:31:07,450 --> 01:31:08,550
Ohh...

1107
01:31:10,150 --> 01:31:13,250
Please, God. No.
You're one of them, aren't you?

1108
01:31:13,350 --> 01:31:14,950
You're one of them.

1109
01:31:15,050 --> 01:31:17,850
No! Don't kill me! Please!

1110
01:31:17,950 --> 01:31:20,450
Don't kill me, please!
Please, please, please.

1111
01:31:20,485 --> 01:31:23,250
Whoa. Relax.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1112
01:31:23,350 --> 01:31:25,050
I'm not gonna hurt you!

1113
01:31:27,650 --> 01:31:29,250
Oh, God.

1114
01:31:32,750 --> 01:31:34,250
What the fuck
are you doing up here?

1115
01:31:34,350 --> 01:31:35,950
What were you looking for?

1116
01:31:36,050 --> 01:31:38,415
I managed to get out of there and

1117
01:31:38,450 --> 01:31:41,650
I was just trying
to get up on the roof

1118
01:31:41,750 --> 01:31:44,450
and see if I could signal for help.

1119
01:31:45,950 --> 01:31:48,050
It's just over here.
Why don't you come and help?

1120
01:31:48,150 --> 01:31:51,250
Hold it. Forget the roof.

1121
01:31:51,950 --> 01:31:54,850
I said forget the roof.
They got people all over it.

1122
01:31:56,250 --> 01:31:58,650
You want to stay alive,
you stay with me.

1123
01:32:01,550 --> 01:32:03,550
The best we can figure it,

1124
01:32:03,650 --> 01:32:07,150
we've got maybe
30 or 35 hostages up there

1125
01:32:07,250 --> 01:32:09,150
probably on the 30th floor

1126
01:32:09,250 --> 01:32:12,850
and maybe seven or eight
terrorists up there.

1127
01:32:12,950 --> 01:32:15,150
Sounds like an A-7 scenario.

1128
01:32:15,250 --> 01:32:17,650
Thank you.
We'll handle it from here.

1129
01:32:17,750 --> 01:32:20,550
When we commandeer your men,
we'll try and let you know.

1130
01:32:20,650 --> 01:32:22,550
Aren't you forgetting something?

1131
01:32:22,650 --> 01:32:23,650
Such as?

1132
01:32:23,750 --> 01:32:25,415
What about John McClane?

1133
01:32:25,450 --> 01:32:28,650
He's the reason
we have any information.

1134
01:32:28,750 --> 01:32:32,350
He's also the reason
you're facing seven terrorists, not twelve.

1135
01:32:32,450 --> 01:32:34,750
He's inside? Who is he?

1136
01:32:34,850 --> 01:32:37,750
He might be a cop.
We're checking on that.

1137
01:32:37,850 --> 01:32:40,550
- One of yours?
- No, no way.

1138
01:32:46,050 --> 01:32:46,950
You smoke?

1139
01:32:48,450 --> 01:32:49,950
Yeah.

1140
01:32:54,750 --> 01:32:55,950
Thanks.

1141
01:32:59,750 --> 01:33:02,650
You don't work for Nakatomi.

1142
01:33:06,950 --> 01:33:08,750
And if you're not one of them...

1143
01:33:11,950 --> 01:33:13,350
I'm a cop from New York.

1144
01:33:15,250 --> 01:33:16,850
New York?

1145
01:33:16,950 --> 01:33:18,050
Yeah.

1146
01:33:18,950 --> 01:33:21,750
Got invited to
the Christmas party by mistake.

1147
01:33:21,850 --> 01:33:23,150
Who knew?

1148
01:33:30,950 --> 01:33:33,350
Better than being caught
with your pants down, huh?

1149
01:33:43,150 --> 01:33:44,550
I'm John McClane.

1150
01:33:45,950 --> 01:33:47,450
You're, uh...

1151
01:33:48,850 --> 01:33:49,950
Clay.

1152
01:33:52,450 --> 01:33:53,750
Bill Clay.

1153
01:33:59,950 --> 01:34:01,950
Know how to use a handgun, Bill?

1154
01:34:03,350 --> 01:34:05,350
I spent a weekend at a combat ranch.

1155
01:34:05,450 --> 01:34:07,750
That game with the guns
that shoot red paint.

1156
01:34:07,850 --> 01:34:10,050
Probably seems kind of stupid to you.

1157
01:34:11,450 --> 01:34:12,650
Nope.

1158
01:34:15,850 --> 01:34:17,650
Time for the real thing, Bill.

1159
01:34:26,150 --> 01:34:28,450
All you got to do
is pull the trigger.

1160
01:34:29,150 --> 01:34:29,650
Come on.

1161
01:34:49,150 --> 01:34:50,650
Put down the gun

1162
01:34:50,750 --> 01:34:53,450
and give me my detonators.

1163
01:34:57,850 --> 01:34:59,250
Well, well, well...

1164
01:35:01,250 --> 01:35:02,250
Hans.

1165
01:35:03,350 --> 01:35:05,850
Put it down now.

1166
01:35:09,450 --> 01:35:12,150
That's pretty tricky
with that accent.

1167
01:35:12,250 --> 01:35:15,550
You oughta be on fucking TV
with that accent.

1168
01:35:18,550 --> 01:35:22,150
But what do you want
with the detonators?

1169
01:35:22,250 --> 01:35:24,950
I already used all the explosives.

1170
01:35:27,250 --> 01:35:28,650
Or did I?

1171
01:35:30,050 --> 01:35:31,650
I'm going to count to three.

1172
01:35:31,850 --> 01:35:34,250
Yeah. Like you did with Takagi?

1173
01:35:35,350 --> 01:35:36,050
Oops.

1174
01:35:37,950 --> 01:35:39,250
No bullets.

1175
01:35:39,350 --> 01:35:42,450
What do you think...
I'm fucking stupid, Hans?

1176
01:35:42,485 --> 01:35:43,550
You were saying?

1177
01:36:38,250 --> 01:36:38,750
Karl.

1178
01:36:39,750 --> 01:36:40,950
SchieÃ dem Fenster.

1179
01:36:48,550 --> 01:36:50,450
Shoot the glass!

1180
01:37:23,750 --> 01:37:25,350
Jesus Christ!

1181
01:37:54,550 --> 01:37:57,450
Smile, Karl.
We're back in business.

1182
01:38:00,150 --> 01:38:03,150
<i>.. is the last resort of diplomacy,</i>

1183
01:38:03,250 --> 01:38:06,250
<i>then couldn't we just as well say</i>

1184
01:38:06,450 --> 01:38:09,350
<i>that terrorism has an equal claim
on being that, too?</i>

1185
01:38:10,050 --> 01:38:12,150
Tell me you got something.

1186
01:38:12,250 --> 01:38:16,150
McClane's name, badge number,
employment record, vital statistics,

1187
01:38:16,250 --> 01:38:17,650
and his family's home address

1188
01:38:17,750 --> 01:38:19,750
right here in LA.

1189
01:38:22,150 --> 01:38:22,950
Whoo!

1190
01:38:28,450 --> 01:38:29,650
Go to work.

1191
01:38:29,850 --> 01:38:31,650
Got it.

1192
01:38:43,850 --> 01:38:47,050
God, that man looks really pissed.

1193
01:38:49,450 --> 01:38:51,450
He's still alive.

1194
01:38:51,750 --> 01:38:52,750
What?

1195
01:38:54,150 --> 01:38:58,150
Only John can drive
somebody that crazy.

1196
01:39:12,950 --> 01:39:16,050
Hans, you better heat up that miracle

1197
01:39:16,150 --> 01:39:18,250
because we just broke through
on number six

1198
01:39:18,350 --> 01:39:21,050
and the electromagnetic
came down like a fucking anvil.

1199
01:39:21,150 --> 01:39:26,450
Have a look at what our friends
outside are doing and I'll be right up.

1200
01:39:28,950 --> 01:39:30,050
<i>Hey, John.</i>

1201
01:39:30,150 --> 01:39:32,550
<i>John McClane, you still with us?</i>

1202
01:39:32,650 --> 01:39:33,750
Yeah.

1203
01:39:34,550 --> 01:39:38,350
But all things being equal,
I'd rather be in Philadelphia.

1204
01:39:38,950 --> 01:39:41,150
Chalk up two more bad guys.

1205
01:39:41,450 --> 01:39:44,250
<i>The boys down here
will be glad to hear that.</i>

1206
01:39:45,150 --> 01:39:46,950
<i>We got a pool going on you.</i>

1207
01:39:47,150 --> 01:39:48,950
What kind of odds am I getting?

1208
01:39:49,050 --> 01:39:50,650
<i>You don't want to know.</i>

1209
01:39:50,750 --> 01:39:52,250
Put me down for 20.

1210
01:39:52,350 --> 01:39:53,450
I'm good for it.

1211
01:39:57,350 --> 01:40:00,050
<i>Hey, pal, you got flat feet?</i>

1212
01:40:02,550 --> 01:40:04,750
What the hell
are you talking about, man?

1213
01:40:04,850 --> 01:40:07,250
Something had
to get you off the street.

1214
01:40:07,350 --> 01:40:08,550
<i>What's the matter?</i>

1215
01:40:08,650 --> 01:40:11,850
<i>You don't think jockeying papers
across a desk is a noble effort for a cop?</i>

1216
01:40:13,750 --> 01:40:15,050
<i>No.</i>

1217
01:40:18,550 --> 01:40:20,550
I had an accident.

1218
01:40:20,650 --> 01:40:22,950
<i>The way you drive, I can see why.</i>

1219
01:40:23,050 --> 01:40:23,750
<i>What'd you do?</i>

1220
01:40:23,850 --> 01:40:26,450
Run over your captain's foot
with the car?

1221
01:40:30,350 --> 01:40:31,550
I shot a kid.

1222
01:40:33,150 --> 01:40:34,950
<i>He was 13 years old.</i>

1223
01:40:36,250 --> 01:40:38,250
<i>Oh, it was dark. I couldn't see him.</i>

1224
01:40:38,350 --> 01:40:40,250
<i>He had a ray gun, looked real enough.</i>

1225
01:40:43,550 --> 01:40:47,250
When you're a rookie, they teach you
everything about being a cop

1226
01:40:47,350 --> 01:40:49,250
except how to live with a mistake.

1227
01:40:53,250 --> 01:40:57,650
<i>Anyway, I just couldn't bring myself
to draw my gun on anybody again.</i>

1228
01:41:01,050 --> 01:41:02,450
<i>Sorry, man.</i>

1229
01:41:03,850 --> 01:41:06,650
Hey, man, how could you know?

1230
01:41:08,950 --> 01:41:10,750
I feel like shit anyway.

1231
01:41:13,750 --> 01:41:15,350
Well, then, this won't matter.

1232
01:41:15,450 --> 01:41:20,250
The LAPD is not calling the shots
down here any more.

1233
01:41:22,650 --> 01:41:23,850
The Feds?

1234
01:41:24,350 --> 01:41:25,450
You got it.

1235
01:41:27,050 --> 01:41:29,350
Those are the city engineers.

1236
01:41:30,550 --> 01:41:31,350
Wait.

1237
01:41:32,150 --> 01:41:34,050
They're going into the street circuits.

1238
01:41:34,150 --> 01:41:37,150
Those guys in the suits,
I don't know who they are.

1239
01:41:37,250 --> 01:41:38,150
That's the FBI.

1240
01:41:39,050 --> 01:41:42,650
They're ordering the others
to cut the building's power.

1241
01:41:42,750 --> 01:41:44,750
Regular as clockwork.

1242
01:41:46,550 --> 01:41:48,150
Or a time lock.

1243
01:41:48,650 --> 01:41:50,415
Precisely.

1244
01:41:50,450 --> 01:41:54,350
The circuits that cannot be cut
are cut automatically

1245
01:41:54,450 --> 01:41:57,150
in response to a terrorist incident.

1246
01:41:57,250 --> 01:41:59,350
You asked for miracles, Theo.

1247
01:41:59,450 --> 01:42:03,650
I give you the F-B-I.

1248
01:42:03,750 --> 01:42:05,650
I want the building shut down.

1249
01:42:05,750 --> 01:42:07,850
I got a problem. I got a switch...

1250
01:42:07,950 --> 01:42:11,950
I don't care
about your switch. I want it out. Dark!

1251
01:42:12,950 --> 01:42:14,450
You can't do it from here.

1252
01:42:14,550 --> 01:42:16,950
- Yeah, you could.
- It can't be done from here.

1253
01:42:17,050 --> 01:42:18,750
I could just... I got the radio...

1254
01:42:18,850 --> 01:42:22,350
You can't do it from here.
It's got to be done from downtown.

1255
01:42:22,450 --> 01:42:24,250
They've gotta take out
a whole city grid.

1256
01:42:24,285 --> 01:42:26,250
We're talking 10 square blocks.

1257
01:42:26,350 --> 01:42:28,150
Ten blocks? Johnson, that's crazy.

1258
01:42:28,250 --> 01:42:30,850
It's Christmas Eve.
There's thousands of people.

1259
01:42:30,885 --> 01:42:32,550
You have to go wider.

1260
01:42:32,650 --> 01:42:37,750
- I need authorization.
- How about the United States government?

1261
01:42:37,850 --> 01:42:39,850
Lose the grid, or you lose your job.

1262
01:42:46,150 --> 01:42:47,850
- Yeah, Central?
- Yeah?

1263
01:42:47,950 --> 01:42:50,315
This is Walt down at Nakatomi.

1264
01:42:50,350 --> 01:42:55,350
Would it be possible for you
to turn off grid 212?

1265
01:42:55,385 --> 01:42:56,515
<i>Are you crazy?!</i>

1266
01:42:56,550 --> 01:42:59,250
Maybe I should call the Mayor.

1267
01:42:59,350 --> 01:43:02,450
No shit it's my ass.
I got a big problem here.

1268
01:43:02,550 --> 01:43:04,850
Shut it down now.

1269
01:43:08,250 --> 01:43:10,450
<i>Emergency lighting activated.</i>

1270
01:43:11,050 --> 01:43:13,850
Al, talk to me. What's going on here?

1271
01:43:13,950 --> 01:43:15,515
<i>Ask the FBI.</i>

1272
01:43:15,550 --> 01:43:18,350
They got the universal
terrorist playbook

1273
01:43:18,450 --> 01:43:20,850
and they're running it step by step.

1274
01:43:22,950 --> 01:43:24,850
It's gonna go. It's gonna go!

1275
01:43:26,650 --> 01:43:28,150
Yes!

1276
01:43:50,950 --> 01:43:52,450
Merry Christmas.

1277
01:43:53,950 --> 01:43:57,150
They must be pissing in their pants.

1278
01:43:57,250 --> 01:43:59,150
The Mayor is gonna have my ass.

1279
01:44:06,150 --> 01:44:07,450
Whoo!

1280
01:44:20,450 --> 01:44:22,650
What are we gonna do now?

1281
01:44:22,750 --> 01:44:25,750
Arrest them for not paying
their electric bill?

1282
01:44:25,850 --> 01:44:27,615
We've shut them down.

1283
01:44:27,650 --> 01:44:31,150
We let them sweat for a while,
then we give them helicopters.

1284
01:44:31,250 --> 01:44:33,450
Right up the ass.

1285
01:44:35,950 --> 01:44:37,550
This is Agent Johnson.

1286
01:44:37,650 --> 01:44:38,950
No, the other one.

1287
01:44:39,050 --> 01:44:42,350
I want that air support ready
to lift off in five minutes.

1288
01:44:42,450 --> 01:44:45,950
Damn right. Fully armed.
We're on the way.

1289
01:44:51,850 --> 01:44:53,750
Oh, yes!

1290
01:44:55,450 --> 01:44:57,850
I wish to talk to the FBI.

1291
01:45:00,450 --> 01:45:02,615
This is Special Agent Johnson.

1292
01:45:02,650 --> 01:45:07,150
<i>The State Department has arranged
for the return of your comrades.</i>

1293
01:45:07,250 --> 01:45:09,850
Helicopters are en route
as you requested.

1294
01:45:09,950 --> 01:45:11,250
<i>I hear you. We'll be ready.</i>

1295
01:45:11,350 --> 01:45:14,650
By the time he figures out
what hit him, he'll be in a body bag.

1296
01:45:14,750 --> 01:45:16,650
When they touch down,
we'll blow the roof.

1297
01:45:16,750 --> 01:45:18,450
They'll spend a month
sifting through the rubble.

1298
01:45:18,650 --> 01:45:21,550
By the time they figure out
what went wrong,

1299
01:45:21,650 --> 01:45:24,650
we'll be sitting on a beach earning 20%.

1300
01:45:29,650 --> 01:45:31,150
Ah! Jeez!

1301
01:45:31,250 --> 01:45:32,250
Powell?

1302
01:45:33,150 --> 01:45:34,950
Yo, Powell, you got a minute?

1303
01:45:36,650 --> 01:45:38,450
I'm here, John.

1304
01:45:40,150 --> 01:45:43,150
Listen, I'm starting to get
a bad feeling up here.

1305
01:45:43,750 --> 01:45:45,650
I want you to do something for me.

1306
01:45:45,750 --> 01:45:47,050
Um... ahem...

1307
01:45:48,550 --> 01:45:50,050
I want you to find my wife.

1308
01:45:50,150 --> 01:45:52,450
Don't ask me how.
By then you'll know how.

1309
01:45:52,550 --> 01:45:55,950
Uh, I want you
to tell her something.

1310
01:45:57,550 --> 01:45:59,250
I want you to tell her that...

1311
01:46:06,150 --> 01:46:08,850
Tell her it took me
a while to figure out

1312
01:46:08,950 --> 01:46:10,850
what a jerk I've been

1313
01:46:11,550 --> 01:46:12,850
but, um...

1314
01:46:14,550 --> 01:46:15,550
that...

1315
01:46:19,350 --> 01:46:22,050
that when things started
to pan out for her

1316
01:46:22,150 --> 01:46:26,250
I should have been more supportive.

1317
01:46:26,750 --> 01:46:27,550
And, uh...

1318
01:46:29,050 --> 01:46:31,950
<i>I just should have been
behind her more.</i>

1319
01:46:34,750 --> 01:46:36,050
Oh, shit.

1320
01:46:38,750 --> 01:46:40,750
Tell her that, um

1321
01:46:41,750 --> 01:46:46,350
that she's the best thing
that ever happened to a bum like me.

1322
01:46:48,250 --> 01:46:51,650
She's heard me say "I love you"
a thousand times.

1323
01:46:52,850 --> 01:46:56,250
She never heard me say I'm sorry.

1324
01:46:56,850 --> 01:47:03,050
I want you to tell her that, Al.
Tell her that John said that he was sorry.

1325
01:47:04,550 --> 01:47:05,550
OK?

1326
01:47:06,550 --> 01:47:07,650
You got that, man?

1327
01:47:07,750 --> 01:47:10,050
<i>Yeah, I got it, John.</i>

1328
01:47:11,350 --> 01:47:13,050
But you can tell her that yourself.

1329
01:47:13,150 --> 01:47:17,650
You just watch your ass
and you'll make it out. You hear me?

1330
01:47:18,150 --> 01:47:20,750
<i>I guess that's up to the man upstairs.</i>

1331
01:47:24,150 --> 01:47:25,650
<i>John?</i>

1332
01:47:26,550 --> 01:47:27,950
<i>John?</i>

1333
01:47:28,450 --> 01:47:31,950
What the fuck
were you doing upstairs, Hans?

1334
01:47:33,650 --> 01:47:34,650
<i>John?</i>

1335
01:47:34,750 --> 01:47:37,850
No, Al, listen.
Just lay off for a while.

1336
01:47:39,850 --> 01:47:42,650
<i>I gotta go check on something.</i>

1337
01:47:45,250 --> 01:47:47,850
One minute, that's all I'm asking.

1338
01:47:47,950 --> 01:47:49,850
One minute to speak to them.

1339
01:47:49,950 --> 01:47:51,950
All right. Get back. Get back.

1340
01:47:52,050 --> 01:47:54,450
All right, look.

1341
01:47:54,550 --> 01:47:58,650
You let me in right now,
or I call the INS, comprende?

1342
01:48:01,250 --> 01:48:03,650
This is the last time
these kids are gonna have

1343
01:48:03,685 --> 01:48:05,850
to speak to their parents.

1344
01:48:07,550 --> 01:48:08,650
All right?

1345
01:48:08,950 --> 01:48:10,950
All right. Come on. Come on.

1346
01:48:21,150 --> 01:48:22,550
What were you doing, Hans?

1347
01:48:23,350 --> 01:48:24,850
What were you doing?

1348
01:48:47,250 --> 01:48:50,450
Jesus, Mary, mother of God.

1349
01:48:53,850 --> 01:48:56,450
Al, listen to me!
It's a double-cross!

1350
01:48:56,550 --> 01:48:58,150
The roof is wired to...

1351
01:49:00,850 --> 01:49:01,950
<i>John?</i>

1352
01:49:04,350 --> 01:49:05,850
<i>John!</i>

1353
01:49:06,150 --> 01:49:07,550
John, come in!

1354
01:49:08,050 --> 01:49:09,050
Did you get that?

1355
01:49:09,150 --> 01:49:12,150
Something about a double-cross.

1356
01:49:12,350 --> 01:49:14,650
Tell me about it.

1357
01:49:20,350 --> 01:49:22,550
We are both professionals.

1358
01:49:24,650 --> 01:49:26,350
This is personal.

1359
01:49:27,750 --> 01:49:29,050
Aww...

1360
01:49:49,950 --> 01:49:52,350
They're coming!

1361
01:49:52,950 --> 01:49:54,550
Choppers are coming.

1362
01:49:54,850 --> 01:49:58,150
Time to gather your flock,
Miss Gennero.

1363
01:49:58,350 --> 01:50:02,350
<i>Your mom and dad
are very important people.</i>

1364
01:50:02,450 --> 01:50:04,450
<i>They're very brave people.</i>

1365
01:50:04,550 --> 01:50:08,550
<i>Is there something you'd like
to say to them, if they're watching?</i>

1366
01:50:08,585 --> 01:50:11,750
<i>Come home.</i>

1367
01:50:20,250 --> 01:50:21,550
Mrs McClane.

1368
01:50:24,850 --> 01:50:28,150
How nice to make your acquaintance.

1369
01:50:31,350 --> 01:50:33,350
On your feet, everyone! To the roof!

1370
01:50:33,450 --> 01:50:36,150
Lock them up there
and come right back.

1371
01:51:03,050 --> 01:51:06,050
You should have heard
your brother squeal

1372
01:51:06,150 --> 01:51:09,350
when I broke his fucking neck!

1373
01:51:12,650 --> 01:51:14,950
What do you figure the breakage?

1374
01:51:15,050 --> 01:51:17,250
I figure we take out the terrorists,

1375
01:51:17,350 --> 01:51:20,250
lose 20, 25% of the hostages, tops.

1376
01:51:21,050 --> 01:51:23,450
I can live with that.

1377
01:51:23,550 --> 01:51:24,950
Get this thing on the deck.

1378
01:51:25,050 --> 01:51:28,450
They're expecting transports,
not gun ships.

1379
01:51:40,550 --> 01:51:42,350
Move it! Come on! Move!

1380
01:51:42,450 --> 01:51:44,050
Come on! Come on!

1381
01:51:44,085 --> 01:51:45,350
Move it!

1382
01:51:46,550 --> 01:51:47,850
Go! Move!

1383
01:51:51,650 --> 01:51:52,650
Theo.

1384
01:51:53,150 --> 01:51:54,750
A little bonus for us.

1385
01:51:54,850 --> 01:51:56,850
Please, sit down. Sit down!

1386
01:51:56,950 --> 01:51:59,650
A policeman's wife
might come in handy.

1387
01:51:59,750 --> 01:52:02,250
McClane, I have some news for you.

1388
01:52:03,250 --> 01:52:04,650
McClane?

1389
01:52:16,050 --> 01:52:17,350
Move!

1390
01:52:20,050 --> 01:52:20,750
Come on!

1391
01:52:33,650 --> 01:52:35,850
Motherfucker! I'll kill you!

1392
01:52:39,850 --> 01:52:40,850
Armed.

1393
01:52:41,350 --> 01:52:43,450
- The truck?
- The truck.

1394
01:52:50,550 --> 01:52:54,650
After all your posturing,
all your little speeches,

1395
01:52:54,750 --> 01:52:57,050
you're nothing but a common thief.

1396
01:52:57,250 --> 01:52:59,750
I am an exceptional thief,
Mrs McClane.

1397
01:52:59,850 --> 01:53:01,450
And since I'm moving up
to kidnapping,

1398
01:53:01,550 --> 01:53:03,550
you should be more polite.

1399
01:53:10,650 --> 01:53:12,750
You motherfucker,
I'm gonna kill you!

1400
01:53:12,850 --> 01:53:16,250
I'm gonna fuckin' cook you,
and I'm gonna fuckin' eat you!

1401
01:53:38,850 --> 01:53:40,950
I don't like this, Sarge.

1402
01:53:48,750 --> 01:53:54,650
Yee-hah!
Just like fucking Saigon, eh, Slick?

1403
01:53:56,150 --> 01:53:59,050
I was in Junior High, dickhead.

1404
01:54:26,950 --> 01:54:28,350
Where's Holly?

1405
01:54:28,450 --> 01:54:29,950
Where's Holly Gennero?

1406
01:54:30,050 --> 01:54:32,150
Holly Gennero? Where's Holly?

1407
01:54:32,250 --> 01:54:34,050
Where's Holly? Where is she?

1408
01:54:34,150 --> 01:54:35,650
- They took her!
- Where?

1409
01:54:35,685 --> 01:54:36,850
The vault!

1410
01:54:36,950 --> 01:54:38,850
- Where is the vault?
- The 30th floor!

1411
01:54:38,950 --> 01:54:40,850
They just took her!

1412
01:54:41,050 --> 01:54:42,215
Get downstairs!

1413
01:54:42,250 --> 01:54:44,850
The whole fucking roof
is wired to blow!

1414
01:54:44,885 --> 01:54:46,450
Get down!

1415
01:54:46,650 --> 01:54:49,150
Get down!
Get the fuck downstairs!

1416
01:54:51,350 --> 01:54:54,250
They made us, Bureau.
Terrorist shooting hostages.

1417
01:54:54,350 --> 01:54:56,050
Break left!

1418
01:55:02,250 --> 01:55:03,950
Nail that sucker!

1419
01:55:12,050 --> 01:55:15,150
I'm on your side, you assholes!

1420
01:55:15,250 --> 01:55:18,350
Swing around again!
I'll bag this little bastard.

1421
01:55:37,250 --> 01:55:39,050
What the fuck...

1422
01:55:41,050 --> 01:55:43,950
Oh, John,
what the fuck are you doing?

1423
01:55:44,050 --> 01:55:46,850
How the fuck
did you get into this shit?

1424
01:55:56,950 --> 01:56:00,350
There's something wrong!
They're coming back down!

1425
01:56:00,385 --> 01:56:02,550
- Blow the roof.
- But Karl's up there!

1426
01:56:02,650 --> 01:56:04,050
Blow the roof!

1427
01:56:07,350 --> 01:56:10,150
I promise I will never even think

1428
01:56:10,250 --> 01:56:13,250
about going up
in a tall building again.

1429
01:56:16,650 --> 01:56:18,950
Oh, God, please don't let me die!

1430
01:57:50,650 --> 01:57:53,050
Holy Christ!

1431
01:57:54,250 --> 01:57:56,850
We're gonna need
some more FBI guys, I guess.

1432
01:58:09,650 --> 01:58:11,450
Jesus fucking Christ!

1433
01:58:12,450 --> 01:58:13,550
Fuck!

1434
01:58:37,950 --> 01:58:40,450
What the fuck is going on?

1435
01:58:42,350 --> 01:58:45,950
What are you gonna do?
Sit here while the building falls down?

1436
01:58:54,250 --> 01:58:55,150
Shit!

1437
01:58:55,250 --> 01:58:57,150
All right!

1438
01:58:58,650 --> 01:58:59,850
Hey! Hey!

1439
01:59:00,750 --> 01:59:02,550
Hang on, baby.

1440
01:59:02,650 --> 01:59:04,250
Hang on, honey.

1441
01:59:05,250 --> 01:59:06,250
Oh, God.

1442
01:59:51,450 --> 01:59:53,150
Hans!

1443
02:00:07,650 --> 02:00:09,350
Jesus.

1444
02:00:09,450 --> 02:00:12,750
Hi, honey.

1445
02:00:33,850 --> 02:00:37,750
So that's what this is all about?
A fucking robbery?

1446
02:00:38,250 --> 02:00:39,450
Put down the gun.

1447
02:00:41,150 --> 02:00:43,450
Why'd you have to nuke
the whole building, Hans?

1448
02:00:43,550 --> 02:00:46,550
Well, when you steal $600,
you can just disappear.

1449
02:00:46,650 --> 02:00:49,650
When you steal 600 million,
they will find you

1450
02:00:49,750 --> 02:00:52,050
unless they think
you're already dead.

1451
02:00:52,150 --> 02:00:54,250
Put down the gun.

1452
02:01:04,750 --> 02:01:06,350
Nein. This is mine.

1453
02:01:09,650 --> 02:01:11,450
You got me.

1454
02:01:11,550 --> 02:01:14,350
Still the cowboy, Mr McClane.

1455
02:01:14,450 --> 02:01:16,050
Americans... all alike.

1456
02:01:16,150 --> 02:01:20,150
This time, John Wayne does not walk off
into the sunset with Grace Kelly.

1457
02:01:20,250 --> 02:01:22,050
That was Gary Cooper, asshole.

1458
02:01:22,150 --> 02:01:23,950
Enough jokes.

1459
02:01:24,050 --> 02:01:26,850
You'd have made a pretty
good cowboy yourself, Hans.

1460
02:01:27,050 --> 02:01:31,650
Oh, yes. What was it
you said to me before?

1461
02:01:31,750 --> 02:01:35,450
Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker.

1462
02:01:56,650 --> 02:01:57,050
Holly!

1463
02:02:03,250 --> 02:02:04,750
Happy trails, Hans.

1464
02:02:10,250 --> 02:02:11,850
- Aah!
- Holly.

1465
02:02:49,350 --> 02:02:51,250
I hope that's not a hostage.

1466
02:03:19,650 --> 02:03:23,650
Gimme water hook-ups
for engine companies 5, 3, 9, 6.

1467
02:03:27,350 --> 02:03:28,950
Over here. It's a better angle.

1468
02:03:29,050 --> 02:03:30,950
Let's give them a hand.

1469
02:03:33,650 --> 02:03:36,650
Keep it going, now. Keep it going.

1470
02:03:41,750 --> 02:03:45,350
- Come on. We're going to miss it!
- OK. Hand me my notes!

1471
02:04:08,350 --> 02:04:12,450
What was it like in there?
How did they treat you?

1472
02:04:58,650 --> 02:05:00,450
Al, this is my wife Holly.

1473
02:05:00,550 --> 02:05:02,450
Holly Gennero.

1474
02:05:03,250 --> 02:05:04,950
Holly McClane.

1475
02:05:05,050 --> 02:05:06,650
Hello, Holly.

1476
02:05:06,850 --> 02:05:08,750
You got yourself a good man.

1477
02:05:08,850 --> 02:05:10,850
You take good care of him.

1478
02:05:11,450 --> 02:05:13,015
McClane!

1479
02:05:13,050 --> 02:05:15,815
McClane, I want a debriefing!

1480
02:05:15,850 --> 02:05:18,550
You got some things
to answer for, mister.

1481
02:05:18,650 --> 02:05:20,350
Ellis' murder, for one thing.

1482
02:05:20,450 --> 02:05:24,250
Property damage,
interfering with police business.

1483
02:06:04,550 --> 02:06:07,650
Two of you go inside
and see if there's anybody else!

1484
02:06:18,450 --> 02:06:21,050
No. This one's with me.

1485
02:06:30,950 --> 02:06:32,550
Mr McClane, Mr McClane!

1486
02:06:32,650 --> 02:06:35,150
Now that it's all over,
after this incredible ordeal,

1487
02:06:35,350 --> 02:06:37,250
what are your feelings?

1488
02:06:42,550 --> 02:06:43,950
Well, well, well.

1489
02:06:44,050 --> 02:06:48,250
- Merry Christmas, Argyle.
- Merry Christmas.

1490
02:06:51,750 --> 02:06:52,850
<i>Did you get that?</i>

1491
02:06:52,950 --> 02:06:54,950
Let me through.

1492
02:06:55,450 --> 02:06:58,950
If this is their idea of Christmas,
I gotta be here for New Year's.
