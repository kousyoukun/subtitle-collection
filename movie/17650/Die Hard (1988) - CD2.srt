Shit!

2
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:27,360
Come on. Let's go.

3
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,080
Ow! Jesus!

4
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,533
All right, spread out.

5
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,061
Shut up.

6
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,689
Let's go.

7
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:53,321
You macho assholes. No! No!

8
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:59,077
Ahem... all right. Listen up, guys.

9
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,580
'Twas the night before Christmas

10
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,666
<i>and all through the house</i>

11
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:07,252
<i>not a creature was stirring, except</i>

12
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:10,296
<i>the four assholes
coming in the rear in standard</i>

13
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,173
two-by-two cover formation.

14
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:15,844
We're all set.

15
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,139
We're ready.

16
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,557
Kick ass.

17
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:21,766
Go!

18
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:24,102
Right. Let's do it.

19
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:40,952
Take cover!

20
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,871
They're shooting at 'em.

21
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,998
It's panic fire.
They can't see anything.

22
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:46,958
They're shooting at the lights.

23
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:54,757
They're going after the lights.
Call them back.

24
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:57,218
It's not happening.

25
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,511
Mike, burn it.

26
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,432
Don't be impatient.

27
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,101
<i>Just wound them.</i>

28
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,606
Get them back.
They're sitting ducks without lights.

29
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,524
They're almost in.

30
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:12,734
Send in the car.

31
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:14,444
Send in the car.

32
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,209
Jesus Christ!

33
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:35,048
Rivers, Rodriguez, report.

34
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:38,051
Wait a minute.
What have we here, gentlemen?

35
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,766
The police have themselves an RV.

36
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:51,439
Southeast corner.

37
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:06,412
Oh, Jesus Christ.

38
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:21,010
Get back! Get the fuck back!

39
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:23,888
Get over there.

40
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:25,473
Schnell! Schnell!

41
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,642
Mach schnell!

42
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:32,397
Weiter! Weiter! Weiter!

43
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,357
Mach schnell! Mach schnell!

44
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,567
Weiter!

45
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,155
Mach los! Mach los!

46
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:01,092
I see him!

47
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,439
- Fire!
- Clear!

48
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:23,448
Oh, my God!
The quarterback is toast!

49
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:26,576
Hang on, Rivers. That's an order.

50
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:28,787
Hit it again.

51
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,289
All right, you motherfucker,
you made your point!

52
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,165
Let them pull back!

53
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,709
Thank you, Mr Cowboy.
I'll take it under advisement.

54
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:35,210
Hit it

55
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,336
<i>again.</i>

56
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,851
Fire.

57
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,409
Fuck me.

58
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,995
Get them out of the car! They're burning!

59
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:21,881
Fuck it.

60
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,469
Mach schnell! Mach los!

61
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:37,939
Let's see you take this
under advisement, jerkweed.

62
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,653
Geronimo, motherfucker.

63
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,381
Oh, shit!

64
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,263
They're using artillery on us!

65
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,432
You idiot, it's not the police.

66
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,684
It's him.

67
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,526
Holy shit.

68
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,325
My God!

69
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:35,455
- Tell me you got that.
- I got it.

70
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,292
Eat your heart out, Channel Five.

71
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,668
<i>We've had an update</i>

72
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:43,338
<i>on the terrorist takeover
of the Nakatomi building.</i>

73
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,548
<i>Sources say
the terrorist leader, Hans,</i>

74
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:47,675
<i>may be this man... Hans Gruber.</i>

75
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,678
<i>A member of the radical
West German Volksfrei movement.</i>

76
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:54,599
<i>Strangely, the Volksfrei leadership
issued a communiqué an hour ago</i>

77
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,477
<i>stating that Gruber had been
expelled from that organization.</i>

78
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,604
<i>Al, do you copy?</i>

79
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,439
Are you all right?

80
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:03,691
Yeah, I'm fine.

81
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,110
W-what was that?

82
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:09,113
<i>Remember that plastic
explosive I told you about?</i>

83
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,117
There you go.
Is the building on fire?

84
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,035
No, but it's gonna need a paintjob

85
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,745
and a shitload of screen doors.

86
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:18,581
Our spotter said you got two
with that blast.

87
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:21,251
- Is that him?
- Yes, sir.

88
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:25,547
I don't know who you think you are

89
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,049
but you just destroyed a building.

90
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:31,261
<i>We do not want your help.
Is that clear?</i>

91
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,096
<i>We don't want your help.</i>

92
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:36,349
<i>I've got 100 people down here,
and they're covered with glass.</i>

93
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:39,352
Glass? Who gives a shit about glass?

94
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:40,395
Who the fuck is this?

95
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,649
This is Deputy Chief of Police
Dwayne T Robinson

96
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,693
and I am in charge of this situation.

97
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,570
Oh, you're in charge?

98
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,655
I got some bad news for you, Dwayne.

99
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:54,033
<i>From up here it doesn't look
like you're in charge of shit.</i>

100
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:56,161
Listen to me, you little asshole...

101
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,120
<i>Asshole?</i>

102
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,955
I'm not the one
who just got buttfucked

103
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,915
<i>on national TV, Dwayne.</i>

104
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,292
Ah ha ha!

105
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,127
<i>Listen to me, jerk-off,</i>

106
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:07,297
<i>if you're not part of the solution,
you're part of the problem.</i>

107
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,508
<i>Quit being part of the problem
and put the other guy back on!</i>

108
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:14,971
Hey, Roy, how you feeling?

109
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,098
Pretty fucking unappreciated, Al.

110
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,476
<i>Hey, look. I love you.</i>

111
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,811
<i>So do a lot of the other guys.</i>

112
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,522
So hang in there, man, you hear me?

113
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,524
You hang in there.

114
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,570
Yeah, thanks, partner.

115
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:37,827
What are you doing?

116
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,162
I'm tired of sitting here

117
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,372
waiting to see
who gets us killed first,

118
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:42,874
them or your husband.

119
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,959
What are you going to do?

120
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:45,877
Hey, babe,

121
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,837
I negotiate million-dollar deals
for breakfast.

122
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,798
I think I can handle this Eurotrash.

123
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:53,468
Hey, sprechen sie talk, huh?

124
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:56,429
If you'd listened to me,
he would be neutralized already.

125
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,181
I don't want neutral. I want dead.

126
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,559
Hope I'm not interrupting.

127
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,644
What does he want?

128
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:06,439
It's not what I "want."
It's what I can "give" you.

129
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:16,157
Look, let's be straight, OK?

130
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,785
It's obvious you're not
some dumb schmuck

131
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,870
up here to snatch a few purses.

132
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,580
You're very perceptive.

133
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:24,374
I watch "60 Minutes."

134
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,127
I say to myself,
these guys are professional,

135
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,629
they're motivated, they're happening,

136
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,339
they want something.

137
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:34,217
I couldn't care less
about your politics.

138
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,553
Maybe you're pissed off
at the camel jockeys.

139
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,054
Maybe it's the Hebes,
Northern Ireland.

140
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,597
It's none of my business.

141
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,933
I figure you're here
to negotiate, am I right?

142
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,143
You're amazing.

143
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:45,603
You figured this all out already?

144
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,772
Hey, business is business.

145
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,774
You use a gun,
I use a fountain pen.

146
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:51,067
What's the difference?

147
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,235
Let's put it in my terms.

148
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,778
You're here on a hostile takeover.

149
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:55,071
You grab us for some green

150
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:58,491
but you didn't expect some poison pill
was gonna be running around the building.

151
00:10:58,575 --> 00:10:59,451
Am I right?

152
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,035
Hans,

153
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:02,704
bubbie...

154
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,956
I'm your white knight.

155
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,751
I must have missed "60 Minutes."

156
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:09,878
What are you saying?

157
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:15,550
The guy upstairs
who's fucking things up, huh?

158
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:21,848
I can give him to you.

159
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,603
<i>Oh, God...</i>

160
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,065
Roy? Roy, you all right?

161
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:35,403
Just trying to fire down
a 1,000-year-old Twinkie.

162
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,864
What do they put in these things,

163
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:38,782
<i>anyway?</i>

164
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:41,117
Sugar, enriched flour,

165
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,244
partially hydrogenated
vegetable oil,

166
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:44,746
polysorbate 60,

167
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,581
<i>and yellow dye number five.</i>

168
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:49,626
<i>Just everything
a growing boy needs.</i>

169
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:52,045
How many kids you got, Al?

170
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:56,132
<i>As a matter of fact,
my wife is working on our first.</i>

171
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,884
How about you, cowboy?

172
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,512
You got any kids
back on your ranch?

173
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,889
Yeah.

174
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:04,265
Two.

175
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,726
Sure hope I can see them

176
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,103
swinging on ajungle gym
with Al Jnr someday.

177
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,358
<i>Well, now, that's a date</i>

178
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:15,568
<i>but you bring the ice cream.</i>

179
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:18,279
<i>Touching, cowboy. Touching.</i>

180
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:20,532
<i>Or should I call you</i>

181
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,700
Mr McClane?

182
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:26,704
Mr Officer John McClane

183
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:29,499
<i>of the New York
Police Department?</i>

184
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:33,294
Get on the phone to Harry in New York.

185
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:35,713
You better get a hold of somebody
at Dispatch.

186
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:39,217
Sister Theresa called me
Mr McClane in the third grade.

187
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,845
My friends call me John

188
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:44,722
and you're neither, shithead.

189
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:48,560
I have someone
who wants to talk to you.

190
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,312
A very special friend

191
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:53,982
<i>who was with you
at the party tonight.</i>

192
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:02,073
Hey, John boy.

193
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:04,826
Ellis?

194
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:06,411
<i>Yeah.</i>

195
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:10,498
<i>Listen, John, they're giving me
a few minutes to talk sense into you.</i>

196
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:13,585
I know you think you're doing yourjob
and I can appreciate that

197
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,378
<i>but you're just dragging
this thing out.</i>

198
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:18,548
<i>Look, no-one gets out of here
until these guys</i>

199
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,300
can talk to the LA Police.

200
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:23,761
That won't happen until you stop
messing up the works. Capisce?

201
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,060
Ellis, what have you told them?

202
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:35,231
I told them we were old friends
and you were my guest

203
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:36,816
<i>at the party.</i>

204
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:39,819
Ellis, you shouldn't be doing this.

205
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:41,154
Tell me about it.

206
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:49,496
All right, John, listen.

207
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:52,791
<i>They want you to tell them
where the detonators are.</i>

208
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:55,084
<i>They know people are listening.</i>

209
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:59,130
<i>They want the detonators,
or they're gonna kill me.</i>

210
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:04,135
John, didn't you hear me?

211
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:08,473
Yeah, I hear you.

212
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,433
John, get with the program.

213
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:13,102
The police are here now.
It's their problem.

214
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,688
Tell these guys where the detonators are
so no-one else gets hurt!

215
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:18,858
I'm putting my life
on the line for you, pal!

216
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:21,110
<i>Ellis, listen to me carefully.</i>

217
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:21,569
John...

218
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:23,655
Shut up, Ellis!
Just shut your mouth!

219
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,824
Put Hans back on the line.

220
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:30,495
<i>Hans, this shithead doesn't know
what kind of man you are but I do.</i>

221
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,580
Good. Then you'll
give us what we want

222
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:34,040
and save your friend's life.

223
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:36,292
You're not part of this equation.

224
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,711
Hey, what am I, a method actor?

225
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:40,296
<i>Babe, put away the gun.</i>

226
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:42,132
<i>This is radio, not television.</i>

227
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,300
Hans, this asshole is not my friend!

228
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:45,844
I just met him tonight!
I don't know him!

229
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:47,971
Jesus Christ, Ellis!
These people will kill you!

230
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:49,931
Tell them you don't know me!

231
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:53,518
<i>How can you say that
after all these years?</i>

232
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,105
John? John?

233
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:21,880
Do you hear that?

234
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:25,091
Talk to me!
Where are my detonators?

235
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:28,136
Where are they,
or shall I shoot another one?

236
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:29,471
<i>Sooner or later</i>

237
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:32,140
<i>I might get to someone
you do care about.</i>

238
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:35,310
Go fuck yourself, Hans.

239
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:38,563
He just let the guy die.

240
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,732
He just gave him up.
Give me that headset.

241
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:42,901
That's like pulling the trigger yourself.

242
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:46,654
Can't you see what's happening?
Can't you read between the lines?

243
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:49,032
He did everything he could
to save him.

244
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:52,202
If he gave himself up,
they'd both be dead right now!

245
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:54,996
No way, man. They'd be talking to us.

246
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,541
You tell this "partner" of yours
to stay out of this from now on.

247
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,711
Because if he doesn't,
I'm really going to nail his ass.

248
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:03,755
The man is hurting.

249
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:05,423
He is alone, tired,

250
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:09,219
and he hasn't seen diddly-squat
from anybody here!

251
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,763
You're gonna tell me he'll give a damn

252
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:15,058
about what you do to him
if he makes it out of there alive?

253
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:18,061
Why don't you wake up
and smell what you're shoveling?

254
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,729
You listen to me, sergeant.

255
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:23,274
Any time you want to go home,
you consider yourself dismissed.

256
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,778
No, sir.
You couldn't drag me away.

257
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,696
<i>Attention, police.</i>

258
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:31,950
<i>Attention, police.</i>

259
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:35,120
- This is Sergeant Al Powell...
- Give me that.

260
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:37,747
This is Deputy Chief Dwayne Robinson.

261
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:38,790
Who is this?

262
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:40,375
This is Hans Gruber.

263
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:45,088
I assume you realize the futility
of direct action against me.

264
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:47,132
We have no wish
for further loss of life.

265
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:50,260
What is it you do wish for?

266
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:54,597
I have comrades in arms
around the world languishing in prison.

267
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,393
The American State Department
enjoys rattling its saber for its own ends.

268
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:00,478
Now it can rattle it for me.

269
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,608
The following people
are to be released from their captors.

270
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:09,279
In Northern Ireland the seven members
of the New Provo Front.

271
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:14,033
<i>In Canada, the five imprisoned leaders
of Liberté de Quebec.</i>

272
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:18,037
<i>In Sri Lanka, the nine members
of the Asian Dawn.</i>

273
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:19,622
What the fuck?

274
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,583
Asian Dawn?

275
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:24,127
I read about them in "Time" magazine.

276
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:28,173
When these revolutionary
brothers and sisters are free,

277
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:31,468
the hostages in this building
will be taken to the roof

278
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:33,887
and they will accompany us
in helicopters

279
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:36,222
to the Los Angeles
International Airport

280
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:38,933
where they will be given
further instructions.

281
00:17:39,017 --> 00:17:40,894
You have two hours to comply.

282
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:44,439
Wait a minute. Uh, Mr. Gruber.
This is crazy.

283
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:48,276
I don't have the authority.
Two hours is not enough.

284
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:50,653
Hello? Hello!

285
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:55,909
Did you get all that?
We got to make some calls.

286
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:58,119
Do you think they'll even try?

287
00:17:58,203 --> 00:17:59,913
Who cares?

288
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:04,793
Theo, are we on schedule?

289
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:06,878
One more to go, then it's up to you.

290
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,340
You better be right
because the last one will take a miracle.

291
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:11,925
It's Christmas, Theo.

292
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,594
It's the time of miracles,
so be of good cheer

293
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:17,472
and call me
when you hit the last lock.

294
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:19,224
Karl,

295
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:22,977
hunt that little shit down
and get those detonators.

296
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:25,188
Fritz is checking the explosives.

297
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,941
I'll check the explosives.
You just get the detonators.

298
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:30,360
Hey, Powell, you out there?

299
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:33,113
I'm here, John. I'm here.

300
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:37,117
You gotta believe me.
There was nothing I could do.

301
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:40,745
Well, it's gonna be
both our asses if you're wrong.

302
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:42,872
I hear you.

303
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:51,214
Did you catch that bullshit
Hans was running?

304
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,842
<i>It doesn't make sense, man.</i>

305
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:56,511
Hey, don't ask me, man.

306
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:59,180
I'm just a deskjockey
who was on my way home when you rang.

307
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:02,892
The way you drove that car
I figured you for the street, Al.

308
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:05,937

the hostages should be going through

the early stages

316

Finland.

318
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:28,042
Basically, it's when the hostages
and the terrorists

319
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:30,753
go through a sort of
psychological transference

320

<i>We've had situations
where the hostages</i>

323
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:40,972
<i>have embraced their captors
after release</i>

324
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:43,391
<i>and even corresponded with them
in prison.</i>

325
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,394
No, no, darling. Asian Dawn. Dawn.

326
00:19:46,478 --> 00:19:49,439
D-A-W-N.

327
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:50,982
- Sir?
- Yeah?

328
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:52,984
Sir, the FBI is here.

329
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:56,821
- The FBI is here now?
- Yes, sir. Right over there.

330
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:58,072
Hold this.

331
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,575
Want a breath mint?

332
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:06,581
Hey, how you doing, man?

333
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:09,751
I'm Agent Johnson.
This is Special Agent Johnson.

334
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:13,171
- Oh, how you doing?
- No relation.

335
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:14,589
I'm, uh...

336
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:19,010
I'm Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.
I'm in charge here.

337
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:21,971
Not any more.

338
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:20,238
Hi, there. How you doing?

339
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:24,576
Ohh...

340
00:21:26,244 --> 00:21:29,372
Please, God. No.
You're one of them, aren't you?

341
00:21:29,456 --> 00:21:30,999
You're one of them.

342
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:33,918
No! Don't kill me! Please!

343
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:36,504
Don't kill me, please!
Please, please, please.

344
00:21:36,588 --> 00:21:39,382
Whoa. Relax.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

345
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:41,134
I'm not gonna hurt you!

346
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:45,305
Oh, God.

347
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:50,310
What the fuck
are you doing up here?

348
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:51,936
What were you looking for?

349
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:54,481
I managed to get out of there and

350
00:21:54,564 --> 00:21:57,650
I was just trying
to get up on the roof

351
00:21:57,775 --> 00:22:00,487
and see if I could signal for help.

352
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:04,115
It's just over here.
Why don't you come and help?

353
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:07,327
Hold it. Forget the roof.

354
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:10,872
I said forget the roof.
They got people all over it.

355
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,709
You want to stay alive,
you stay with me.

356
00:22:17,587 --> 00:22:19,589
The best we can figure it,

357
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:23,176
we've got maybe
30 or 35 hostages up there

358
00:22:23,301 --> 00:22:25,220
probably on the 30th floor

359
00:22:25,303 --> 00:22:28,932
and maybe seven or eight
terrorists up there.

360
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:31,184
Sounds like an A-"7" scenario.

361
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:33,645
Thank you.
We'll handle it from here.

362
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:36,606
When we commandeer your men,
we'll try and let you know.

363
00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:38,608
Aren't you forgetting something?

364
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:39,692
Such as?

365
00:22:39,818 --> 00:22:41,486
What about John McClane?

366
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:44,656
He's the reason
we have any information.

367
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:48,409
He's also the reason
you're facing seven terrorists, not twelve.

368
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:50,787
He's inside? Who is he?

369
00:22:50,912 --> 00:22:53,832
He might be a cop.
We're checking on that.

370
00:22:53,915 --> 00:22:56,584
- One of yours?
- No, no way.

371
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:02,966
You smoke?

372
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:06,010
Yeah.

373
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:11,975
Thanks.

374
00:23:15,854 --> 00:23:18,690
You don't work for Nakatomi.

375
00:23:23,027 --> 00:23:24,821
And if you're not one of them...

376
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:29,451
I'm a cop from New York.

377
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:32,912
New York?

378
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:34,038
Yeah.

379
00:23:34,998 --> 00:23:37,834
Got invited to
the Christmas party by mistake.

380
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:39,210
Who knew?

381
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:49,387
Better than being caught
with your pants down, huh?

382
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,607
I'm John McClane.

383
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:03,485
You're, uh...

384
00:24:04,861 --> 00:24:05,987
Clay.

385
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:09,824
Bill Clay.

386
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:18,041
Know how to use a handgun, Bill?

387
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:21,461
I spent a weekend at a combat ranch.

388
00:24:21,544 --> 00:24:23,797
That game with the guns
that shoot red paint.

389
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,090
Probably seems kind of stupid to you.

390
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:28,718
Nope.

391
00:24:31,846 --> 00:24:33,640
Time for the real thing, Bill.

392
00:24:42,273 --> 00:24:44,484
All you got to do
is pull the trigger.

393
00:24:45,193 --> 00:24:45,735
Come on.

394
00:25:05,213 --> 00:25:06,673
Put down the gun

395
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:09,509
and give me my detonators.

396
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:15,348
Well, well, well...

397
00:25:17,308 --> 00:25:18,351
Hans.

398
00:25:19,394 --> 00:25:21,938
Put it down now.

399
00:25:25,525 --> 00:25:28,153
That's pretty tricky
with that accent.

400
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:31,573
You oughta be on fucking TV
with that accent.

401
00:25:34,576 --> 00:25:38,246
But what do you want
with the detonators?

402
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:40,957
I already used all the explosives.

403
00:25:43,334 --> 00:25:44,627
Or did I?

404
00:25:46,129 --> 00:25:47,714
I'm going to count to three.

405
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:50,258
Yeah. Like you did with Takagi?

406
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:52,051
Oops.

407
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:55,305
No bullets.

408
00:25:55,388 --> 00:25:58,475
What do you think...
I'm fucking stupid, Hans?

409
00:25:58,558 --> 00:25:59,601
You were saying?

410
00:26:54,322 --> 00:26:54,781
Karl.

411
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,991
Schieß dem Fenster.

412
00:27:04,582 --> 00:27:06,501
Shoot the glass!

413
00:27:39,826 --> 00:27:41,369
Jesus Christ!

414
00:28:10,607 --> 00:28:13,568
Smile, Karl.
We're back in business.

415
00:28:16,237 --> 00:28:19,199
<i>... is the last resort of diplomacy,</i>

416
00:28:19,324 --> 00:28:22,327
<i>then couldn't we just as well say</i>

417
00:28:22,494 --> 00:28:25,330
<i>that terrorism has an equal claim
on being that, too?</i>

418
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,208
Tell me you got something.

419
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:32,212
McClane's name, badge number,
employment record, vital statistics,

420
00:28:32,337 --> 00:28:33,713
and his family's home address

421
00:28:33,838 --> 00:28:35,757
right here in LA.

422
00:28:38,218 --> 00:28:38,968
Whoo!

423
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:45,683
Go to work.

424
00:28:45,934 --> 00:28:47,685
Got it.

425
00:28:59,864 --> 00:29:03,118
God, that man looks really pissed.

426
00:29:05,453 --> 00:29:07,455
He's still alive.

427
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:08,748
What?

428
00:29:10,208 --> 00:29:14,129
Only John can drive
somebody that crazy.

429
00:29:29,018 --> 00:29:32,063
Hans, you better heat up that miracle

430
00:29:32,147 --> 00:29:34,315
because we just broke through
on number six

431
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:37,110
and the electromagnetic
came down like a fucking anvil.

432
00:29:37,193 --> 00:29:42,574
Have a look at what our friends
outside are doing and I'll be right up.

433
00:29:44,951 --> 00:29:46,119
<i>Hey, John.</i>

434
00:29:46,202 --> 00:29:48,580
<i>John McClane, you still with us?</i>

435
00:29:48,705 --> 00:29:49,789
Yeah.

436
00:29:50,582 --> 00:29:54,419
But all things being equal,
I'd rather be in Philadelphia.

437
00:29:55,044 --> 00:29:57,172
Chalk up two more bad guys.

438
00:29:57,505 --> 00:30:00,300
<i>The boys down here
will be glad to hear that.</i>

439
00:30:01,176 --> 00:30:03,052
<i>We got a pool going on you.</i>

440
00:30:03,136 --> 00:30:05,013
What kind of odds am I getting?

441
00:30:05,096 --> 00:30:06,723
<i>You don't want to know.</i>

442
00:30:06,806 --> 00:30:08,266
Put me down for 20.

443
00:30:08,349 --> 00:30:09,517
I'm good for it.

444
00:30:13,438 --> 00:30:16,107
<i>Hey, pal, you got flat feet?</i>

445
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:20,820
What the hell
are you talking about, man?

446
00:30:20,904 --> 00:30:23,364
Something had
to get you off the street.

447
00:30:23,448 --> 00:30:24,616
<i>What's the matter?</i>

448
00:30:24,699 --> 00:30:27,952
<i>You don't think jockeying papers
across a desk is a noble effort for a cop?</i>

449
00:30:29,871 --> 00:30:31,164
<i>No.</i>

450
00:30:34,626 --> 00:30:36,586
I had an accident.

451
00:30:36,711 --> 00:30:39,047
<i>The way you drive, I can see why.</i>

452
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:39,839
<i>What'd you do?</i>

453
00:30:39,923 --> 00:30:42,509
Run over your captain's foot
with the car?

454
00:30:46,429 --> 00:30:47,597
I shot a kid.

455
00:30:49,224 --> 00:30:51,059
<i>He was 13 years old.</i>

456
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:54,270
<i>Oh, it was dark. I couldn't see him.</i>

457
00:30:54,437 --> 00:30:56,314
<i>He had a ray gun, looked real enough.</i>

458
00:30:59,567 --> 00:31:03,321
When you're a rookie, they teach you
everything about being a cop

459
00:31:03,446 --> 00:31:05,281
except how to live with a mistake.

460
00:31:09,327 --> 00:31:13,665
<i>Anyway, I just couldn't bring myself
to draw my gun on anybody again.</i>

461
00:31:17,168 --> 00:31:18,461
<i>Sorry, man.</i>

462
00:31:19,963 --> 00:31:22,674
Hey, man, how could you know?

463
00:31:25,051 --> 00:31:26,845
I feel like shit anyway.

464
00:31:29,848 --> 00:31:31,432
Well, then, this won't matter.

465
00:31:31,516 --> 00:31:36,312
The LAPD is not calling the shots
down here any more.

466
00:31:38,731 --> 00:31:39,899
The Feds?

467
00:31:40,483 --> 00:31:41,526
You got it.

468
00:31:43,153 --> 00:31:45,447
Those are the city engineers.

469
00:31:46,614 --> 00:31:47,365
Wait.

470
00:31:48,241 --> 00:31:50,118
They're going into the street circuits.

471
00:31:50,201 --> 00:31:53,246
Those guys in the suits,
I don't know who they are.

472
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:54,247
That's the FBI.

473
00:31:55,165 --> 00:31:58,710
They're ordering the others
to cut the building's power.

474
00:31:58,793 --> 00:32:00,753
Regular as clockwork.

475
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,257
Or a time lock.

476
00:32:04,716 --> 00:32:06,509
Precisely.

477
00:32:06,551 --> 00:32:10,388
The circuits that cannot be cut
are cut automatically

478
00:32:10,513 --> 00:32:13,266
in response to a terrorist incident.

479
00:32:13,349 --> 00:32:15,477
You asked for miracles, Theo.

480
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:19,689
I give you the F-B-I.

481
00:32:19,773 --> 00:32:21,733
I want the building shut down.

482
00:32:21,775 --> 00:32:23,943
I got a problem. I got a switch...

483
00:32:24,027 --> 00:32:27,989
I don't care
about your switch. I want it out. Dark!

484
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,492
You can't do it from here.

485
00:32:30,575 --> 00:32:33,036
- Yeah, you could.
- It can't be done from here.

486
00:32:33,161 --> 00:32:34,788
I could just... I got the radio...

487
00:32:34,913 --> 00:32:38,333
You can't do it from here.
It's got to be done from downtown.

488
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,293
They've gotta take out
a whole city grid.

489
00:32:40,376 --> 00:32:42,337
We're talking 10 square blocks.

490
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:44,214
Ten blocks? Johnson, that's crazy.

491
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:46,883
It's Christmas Eve.
There's thousands of people.

492
00:32:46,966 --> 00:32:48,593
You have to go wider.

493
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:53,807
- I need authorization.
- How about the United States government?

494
00:32:53,932 --> 00:32:55,975
Lose the grid, or you lose yourjob.

495
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:03,942
- Yeah, Central?
- Yeah?

496
00:33:04,025 --> 00:33:06,402
This is Walt down at Nakatomi.

497
00:33:06,444 --> 00:33:11,407
Would it be possible for you
to turn off grid 212?

498
00:33:11,449 --> 00:33:12,575
<i>Are you crazy?!</i>

499
00:33:12,617 --> 00:33:15,370
Maybe I should call the Mayor.

500
00:33:15,453 --> 00:33:18,540
No shit it's my ass.
I got a big problem here.

501
00:33:18,581 --> 00:33:20,959
Shut it down now.

502
00:33:24,295 --> 00:33:26,548
<i>Emergency lighting activated.</i>

503
00:33:27,132 --> 00:33:29,926
Al, talk to me. What's going on here?

504
00:33:30,009 --> 00:33:31,553
<i>Ask the FBI.</i>

505
00:33:31,636 --> 00:33:34,430
They got the universal
terrorist playbook

506
00:33:34,472 --> 00:33:36,891
and they're running it step by step.

507
00:33:39,018 --> 00:33:40,979
It's gonna go. It's gonna go!

508
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:44,190
Yes!

509
00:34:07,005 --> 00:34:08,506
Merry Christmas.

510
00:34:10,008 --> 00:34:13,219
They must be pissing in their pants.

511
00:34:13,303 --> 00:34:15,180
The Mayor is gonna have my ass.

512
00:34:22,187 --> 00:34:23,480
Whoo!

513
00:34:36,493 --> 00:34:38,661
What are we gonna do now?

514
00:34:38,787 --> 00:34:41,748
Arrest them for not paying
their electric bill?

515
00:34:41,873 --> 00:34:43,666
We've shut them down.

516
00:34:43,708 --> 00:34:47,170
We let them sweat for a while,
then we give them helicopters.

517
00:34:47,295 --> 00:34:49,506
Right up the ass.

518
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:53,551
This is Agent Johnson.

519
00:34:53,676 --> 00:34:55,053
No, the other one.

520
00:34:55,178 --> 00:34:58,473
I want that air support ready
to lift off in five minutes.

521
00:34:58,556 --> 00:35:01,976
Damn right. Fully armed.
We're on the way.

522
00:35:07,899 --> 00:35:09,818
Oh, yes!

523
00:35:11,569 --> 00:35:13,947
I wish to talk to the FBI.

524
00:35:16,574 --> 00:35:18,660
This is Special Agent Johnson.

525
00:35:18,743 --> 00:35:23,206
<i>The State Department has arranged
for the return of your comrades.</i>

526
00:35:23,331 --> 00:35:25,917
Helicopters are en route
as you requested.

527
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,377
<i>I hear you. We'll be ready.</i>

528
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:30,713
By the time he figures out
what hit him, he'll be in a body bag.

529
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:32,715
When they touch down,
we'll blow the roof.

530
00:35:32,757 --> 00:35:34,551
They'll spend a month
sifting through the rubble.

531
00:35:34,634 --> 00:35:37,595
By the time they figure out
what went wrong,

532
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:40,723
we'll be sitting on a beach earning 20%.

533
00:35:45,687 --> 00:35:47,188
Ah! Jeez!

534
00:35:47,313 --> 00:35:48,314
Powell?

535
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,984
Yo, Powell, you got a minute?

536
00:35:52,735 --> 00:35:54,487
I'm here, John.

537
00:35:56,197 --> 00:35:59,200
Listen, I'm starting to get
a bad feeling up here.

538
00:35:59,784 --> 00:36:01,744
I want you to do something for me.

539
00:36:01,786 --> 00:36:03,079
Um... ahem...

540
00:36:04,622 --> 00:36:06,082
I want you to find my wife.

541
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:08,585
Don't ask me how.
By then you'll know how.

542
00:36:08,626 --> 00:36:12,005
Uh, I want you
to tell her something.

543
00:36:13,631 --> 00:36:15,341
I want you to tell her that...

544
00:36:22,265 --> 00:36:24,893
Tell her it took me
a while to figure out

545
00:36:24,976 --> 00:36:26,978
what ajerk I've been

546
00:36:27,645 --> 00:36:28,897
but, um...

547
00:36:30,565 --> 00:36:31,566
that...

548
00:36:35,487 --> 00:36:38,156
that when things started
to pan out for her

549
00:36:38,281 --> 00:36:42,327
I should have been more supportive.

550
00:36:42,744 --> 00:36:43,620
And, uh...

551
00:36:45,163 --> 00:36:48,041
<i>I just should have been
behind her more.</i>

552
00:36:50,835 --> 00:36:52,086
Oh, shit.

553
00:36:54,756 --> 00:36:56,800
Tell her that, um

554
00:36:57,759 --> 00:37:02,388
that she's the best thing
that ever happened to a bum like me.

555
00:37:04,307 --> 00:37:07,685
She's heard me say "I love you"
a thousand times.

556
00:37:08,853 --> 00:37:12,315
She never heard me say I'm sorry.

557
00:37:12,941 --> 00:37:19,155
I want you to tell her that, Al.
Tell her that John said that he was sorry.

558
00:37:20,573 --> 00:37:21,533
OK?

559
00:37:22,575 --> 00:37:23,660
You got that, man?

560
00:37:23,785 --> 00:37:26,079
<i>Yeah, I got it, John.</i>

561
00:37:27,413 --> 00:37:29,082
But you can tell her that yourself.

562
00:37:29,207 --> 00:37:33,628
You just watch your ass
and you'll make it out. You hear me?

563
00:37:34,254 --> 00:37:36,840
<i>I guess that's up to the man upstairs.</i>

564
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,678
<i>John?</i>

565
00:37:42,554 --> 00:37:44,055
<i>John?</i>

566
00:37:44,514 --> 00:37:47,976
What the fuck
were you doing upstairs, Hans?

567
00:37:49,644 --> 00:37:50,645
<i>John?</i>

568
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:53,857
No, Al, listen.
Just lay off for a while.

569
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,653
<i>I gotta go check on something.</i>

570
00:38:01,281 --> 00:38:03,908
One minute, that's all I'm asking.

571
00:38:04,075 --> 00:38:05,869
One minute to speak to them.

572
00:38:05,994 --> 00:38:07,996
All right. Get back. Get back.

573
00:38:08,121 --> 00:38:10,540
All right, look.

574
00:38:10,582 --> 00:38:14,711
You let me in right now,
or I call the INS, comprende?

575
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:19,674
This is the last time
these kids are gonna have

576
00:38:19,757 --> 00:38:21,885
to speak to their parents.

577
00:38:23,595 --> 00:38:24,679
All right?

578
00:38:25,013 --> 00:38:27,015
All right. Come on. Come on.

579
00:38:37,275 --> 00:38:38,610
What were you doing, Hans?

580
00:38:39,444 --> 00:38:40,904
What were you doing?

581
00:39:03,301 --> 00:39:06,513
Jesus, Mary, mother of God.

582
00:39:09,891 --> 00:39:12,560
Al, listen to me!
It's a double-cross!

583
00:39:12,602 --> 00:39:14,229
The roof is wired to...

584
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:17,899
<i>John?</i>

585
00:39:20,401 --> 00:39:21,861
<i>John!</i>

586
00:39:22,237 --> 00:39:23,571
John, come in!

587
00:39:24,155 --> 00:39:25,115
Did you get that?

588
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,201
Something about a double-cross.

589
00:39:28,368 --> 00:39:30,662
Tell me about it.

590
00:39:36,376 --> 00:39:38,586
We are both professionals.

591
00:39:40,713 --> 00:39:42,423
This is personal.

592
00:39:43,758 --> 00:39:45,135
Aww...

593
00:40:05,989 --> 00:40:08,450
They're coming!

594
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:10,618
Choppers are coming.

595
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:14,247
Time to gather your flock,
Miss Gennero.

596
00:40:14,372 --> 00:40:18,418
<i>Your mom and dad
are very important people.</i>

597
00:40:18,543 --> 00:40:20,503
<i>They're very brave people.</i>

598
00:40:20,587 --> 00:40:24,549
<i>Is there something you'd like
to say to them, if they're watching?</i>

599
00:40:24,632 --> 00:40:27,802
<i>Come home.</i>

600
00:40:36,269 --> 00:40:37,604
Mrs McClane.

601
00:40:40,857 --> 00:40:44,194
How nice to make your acquaintance.

602
00:40:47,447 --> 00:40:49,407
On your feet, everyone! To the roof!

603
00:40:49,532 --> 00:40:52,160
Lock them up there
and come right back.

604
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:22,107
You should have heard
your brother squeal

605
00:41:22,273 --> 00:41:25,443
when I broke his fucking neck!

606
00:41:28,655 --> 00:41:31,032
What do you figure the breakage?

607
00:41:31,116 --> 00:41:33,284
I figure we take out the terrorists,

608
00:41:33,451 --> 00:41:36,329
lose 20, 25% of the hostages, tops.

609
00:41:37,122 --> 00:41:39,582
I can live with that.

610
00:41:39,624 --> 00:41:41,000
Get this thing on the deck.

611
00:41:41,084 --> 00:41:44,546
They're expecting transports,
not gun ships.

612
00:41:56,599 --> 00:41:58,435
Move it! Come on! Move!

613
00:41:58,518 --> 00:42:00,019
Come on! Come on!

614
00:42:00,145 --> 00:42:01,438
Move it!

615
00:42:02,647 --> 00:42:03,857
Go! Move!

616
00:42:07,735 --> 00:42:08,695
Theo.

617
00:42:09,237 --> 00:42:10,822
A little bonus for us.

618
00:42:10,905 --> 00:42:12,866
Please, sit down. Sit down!

619
00:42:12,991 --> 00:42:15,702
A policeman's wife
might come in handy.

620
00:42:15,785 --> 00:42:18,246
McClane, I have some news for you.

621
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:20,623
McClane?

622
00:42:32,093 --> 00:42:33,428
Move!

623
00:42:36,055 --> 00:42:36,806
Come on!

624
00:42:49,694 --> 00:42:51,946
Motherfucker! I'll kill you!

625
00:42:55,867 --> 00:42:56,910
Armed.

626
00:42:57,452 --> 00:42:59,454
- The truck?
- The truck.

627
00:43:06,628 --> 00:43:10,673
After all your posturing,
all your little speeches,

628
00:43:10,757 --> 00:43:13,134
you're nothing but a common thief.

629
00:43:13,384 --> 00:43:15,804
I am an exceptional thief,
Mrs McClane.

630
00:43:15,929 --> 00:43:17,555
And since I'm moving up
to kidnapping,

631
00:43:17,597 --> 00:43:19,557
you should be more polite.

632
00:43:26,648 --> 00:43:28,775
You motherfucker,
I'm gonna kill you!

633
00:43:28,858 --> 00:43:32,278
I'm gonna fuckin' cook you,
and I'm gonna fuckin' eat you!

634
00:43:54,926 --> 00:43:56,970
I don't like this, Sarge.

635
00:44:04,769 --> 00:44:10,650
Yee-hah!
Just like fucking Saigon, eh, Slick?

636
00:44:12,193 --> 00:44:15,071
I was in Junior High, dickhead.

637
00:44:42,974 --> 00:44:44,476
Where's Holly?

638
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:45,977
Where's Holly Gennero?

639
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:48,188
Holly Gennero? Where's Holly?

640
00:44:48,271 --> 00:44:50,106
Where's Holly? Where is she?

641
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:51,649
- They took her!
- Where?

642
00:44:51,733 --> 00:44:52,942
The vault!

643
00:44:53,026 --> 00:44:54,944
- Where is the vault?
- The 30th floor!

644
00:44:55,028 --> 00:44:56,946
They just took her!

645
00:44:57,155 --> 00:44:58,281
Get downstairs!

646
00:44:58,323 --> 00:45:00,825
The whole fucking roof
is wired to blow!

647
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:02,577
Get down!

648
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:05,205
Get down!
Get the fuck downstairs!

649
00:45:07,415 --> 00:45:10,293
They made us, Bureau.
Terrorist shooting hostages.

650
00:45:10,335 --> 00:45:12,086
Break left!

651
00:45:18,343 --> 00:45:20,011
Nail that sucker!

652
00:45:28,144 --> 00:45:31,106
I'm on your side, you assholes!

653
00:45:31,272 --> 00:45:34,359
Swing around again!
I'll bag this little bastard.

654
00:45:53,294 --> 00:45:55,130
What the fuck...

655
00:45:57,090 --> 00:45:59,968
Oh, John,
what the fuck are you doing?

656
00:46:00,051 --> 00:46:02,929
How the fuck
did you get into this shit?

657
00:46:12,939 --> 00:46:16,359
There's something wrong!
They're coming back down!

658
00:46:16,401 --> 00:46:18,611
- Blow the roof.
- But Karl's up there!

659
00:46:18,736 --> 00:46:20,113
Blow the roof!

660
00:46:23,366 --> 00:46:26,202
I promise I will never even think

661
00:46:26,327 --> 00:46:29,289
about going up
in a tall building again.

662
00:46:32,709 --> 00:46:35,003
Oh, God, please don't let me die!

663
00:48:06,678 --> 00:48:09,139
Holy Christ!

664
00:48:10,348 --> 00:48:12,976
We're gonna need
some more FBI guys, I guess.

665
00:48:25,738 --> 00:48:27,490
Jesus fucking Christ!

666
00:48:28,491 --> 00:48:29,617
Fuck!

667
00:48:54,017 --> 00:48:56,478
What the fuck is going on?

668
00:48:58,396 --> 00:49:02,025
What are you gonna do?
Sit here while the building falls down?

669
00:49:10,366 --> 00:49:11,201
Shit!

670
00:49:11,326 --> 00:49:13,203
All right!

671
00:49:14,662 --> 00:49:15,872
Hey! Hey!

672
00:49:16,831 --> 00:49:18,583
Hang on, baby.

673
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:20,251
Hang on, honey.

674
00:49:21,336 --> 00:49:22,337
Oh, God.

675
00:50:07,465 --> 00:50:09,217
Hans!

676
00:50:23,731 --> 00:50:25,442
Jesus.

677
00:50:25,567 --> 00:50:28,820
Hi, honey.

678
00:50:49,883 --> 00:50:53,845
So that's what this is all about?
A fucking robbery?

679
00:50:54,304 --> 00:50:55,472
Put down the gun.

680
00:50:57,223 --> 00:50:59,476
Why'd you have to nuke
the whole building, Hans?

681
00:50:59,559 --> 00:51:02,562
Well, when you steal $600,
you can just disappear.

682
00:51:02,687 --> 00:51:05,690
When you steal 600 million,
they will find you

683
00:51:05,857 --> 00:51:08,109
unless they think
you're already dead.

684
00:51:08,193 --> 00:51:10,278
Put down the gun.

685
00:51:20,789 --> 00:51:22,457
Nein. This is mine.

686
00:51:25,710 --> 00:51:27,504
You got me.

687
00:51:27,587 --> 00:51:30,423
Still the cowboy, Mr McClane.

688
00:51:30,507 --> 00:51:32,175
Americans... all alike.

689
00:51:32,258 --> 00:51:36,179
This time, John Wayne does not walk off
into the sunset with Grace Kelly.

690
00:51:36,304 --> 00:51:38,139
That was Gary Cooper, asshole.

691
00:51:38,223 --> 00:51:40,016
Enough jokes.

692
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:42,977
You'd have made a pretty
good cowboy yourself, Hans.

693
00:51:43,061 --> 00:51:47,690
Oh, yes. What was it
you said to me before?

694
00:51:47,816 --> 00:51:51,528
Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker.

695
00:52:12,674 --> 00:52:13,174
Holly!

696
00:52:19,305 --> 00:52:20,723
Happy trails, Hans.

697
00:52:26,312 --> 00:52:27,939
- Aah!
- Holly.

698
00:53:05,477 --> 00:53:07,353
I hope that's not a hostage.

699
00:53:35,715 --> 00:53:39,677
Gimme water hook-ups
for engine companies 5, 3, 9, 6.

700
00:53:43,431 --> 00:53:45,058
Over here. It's a better angle.

701
00:53:45,183 --> 00:53:47,060
Let's give them a hand.

702
00:53:49,687 --> 00:53:52,690
Keep it going, now. Keep it going.

703
00:53:57,821 --> 00:54:01,407
- Come on. We're going to miss it!
- OK. Hand me my notes!

704
00:54:24,472 --> 00:54:28,476
What was it like in there?
How did they treat you?

705
00:55:14,731 --> 00:55:16,524
Al, this is my wife Holly.

706
00:55:16,608 --> 00:55:18,526
Holly Gennero.

707
00:55:19,277 --> 00:55:21,029
Holly McClane.

708
00:55:21,112 --> 00:55:22,697
Hello, Holly.

709
00:55:22,864 --> 00:55:24,741
You got yourself a good man.

710
00:55:24,908 --> 00:55:26,868
You take good care of him.

711
00:55:27,577 --> 00:55:29,037
McClane!

712
00:55:29,162 --> 00:55:31,873
McClane, I want a debriefing!

713
00:55:31,956 --> 00:55:34,584
You got some things
to answer for, mister.

714
00:55:34,667 --> 00:55:36,461
Ellis' murder, for one thing.

715
00:55:36,544 --> 00:55:40,298
Property damage,
interfering with police business.

716
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:23,716
Two of you go inside
and see if there's anybody else!

717
00:56:34,519 --> 00:56:37,105
No. This one's with me.

718
00:56:47,031 --> 00:56:48,575
Mr McClane, Mr McClane!

719
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:51,244
Now that it's all over,
after this incredible ordeal,

720
00:56:51,369 --> 00:56:53,371
what are your feelings?

721
00:56:58,585 --> 00:57:00,003
Well, well, well.

722
00:57:00,044 --> 00:57:04,340
- Merry Christmas, Argyle.
- Merry Christmas.

723
00:57:07,844 --> 00:57:08,928
<i>Did you get that?</i>

724
00:57:09,012 --> 00:57:10,972
Let me through.

725
00:57:11,514 --> 00:57:15,018
If this is their idea of Christmas,
I gotta be here for New Year's.

726
00:57:16,018 --> 00:57:26,018
