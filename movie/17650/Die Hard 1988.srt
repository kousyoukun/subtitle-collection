这是长富公司历史性的一刻
for making this
one of the greatest years...

7
00:00:16,423 --> 00:00:19,324

荷莉，一起去吃晚餐好吗？
Hey, Holly,

16
00:00:36,309 --> 00:00:37,708
what about
dinner tonight, huh?

17
00:00:37,811 --> 00:00:40,712
Harry, it's Christmas Eve.

18
00:00:40,814 --> 00:00:43,715
哈利，现在是平安夜
Families, stockings...

19
00:00:45,685 --> 00:00:47,209
家人，长袜…
粟子
chestnuts...

20
00:00:47,354 --> 00:00:48,753
鲁道夫和佛斯帝
Rudolph and Frosty.

21
00:00:48,855 --> 00:00:51,756
Any of these things
ring a bell?

22
00:00:51,858 --> 00:00:53,758
这些事是否令你想起什么？
事实上，是想起了红酒和乳酪
Actually, I was
thinking more...

23
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,761
of mulled wine,
a nice aged brie,

24
00:00:56,863 --> 00:00:58,763
and a roaring fireplace.

25
00:00:58,865 --> 00:01:00,765
躺在火盆旁聊天
明白我在说什么吗？
You know what I'm saying?

26
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:04,769
已经五点四十分了
Ginny, it's 5:40.

27
00:01:04,871 --> 00:01:07,772
去喝香槟参加舞会吧
Go join the party.
Have some champagne.

28
00:01:07,874 --> 00:01:10,775
你使我觉得像在压榨工人
You're making me feel
like Ebenezer Scrooge.

29
00:01:10,877 --> 00:01:13,778
谢谢，麦克连太太
小朋友受得这些酒吗？
Can the baby
handle a little sip?

30
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,280
这个小孩已准备做酒保了
That baby's ready
to tend bar.

31
00:01:16,383 --> 00:01:18,408
最后一次机会了
Last chance.

32
00:01:18,552 --> 00:01:19,610
再见
Bye.

33
00:01:25,792 --> 00:01:29,250
麦克连公馆，我是露西.麦克连

00:01:29,362 --> 00:01:30,852
哈，露西.麦克连
Hello, Lucy McClane.

35
00:01:30,964 --> 00:01:32,864
This is
your mother speaking.

36
00:01:32,966 --> 00:01:34,365
我是妈妈
Mommy!

37
00:01:34,467 --> 00:01:36,367
妈，何时回家？
When are you
coming home?

38
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:38,369
很快了，很快了
Pretty soon.
Pretty soon.

39
00:01:38,471 --> 00:01:41,872
不过我回来时你要在床上
You'll be in bed
when I get there, though.

40
00:01:41,975 --> 00:01:43,875
让我和波莉谈一谈，好吗？
Let me talk to Paulina.

41
00:01:43,977 --> 00:01:46,377
不要在屋里四处找礼物
And no snooping
around the house,

42
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,912
looking for presents.

43
00:01:48,014 --> 00:01:50,380
爸爸和你一起回家吗？
Is Daddy coming home
with you?

44
00:01:52,686 --> 00:01:54,586
到时再看看圣诞老人
和妈妈好了
Well, we'll see what...

45
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:57,088
Santa and Mommy
can do, okay?

46
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,090
叫波莉来，再见
Put Paulina on.
Bye, honey.

47
00:01:59,192 --> 00:02:00,784
波莉
Paulina!

48
00:02:05,866 --> 00:02:07,891
<i>太太，你好
Hola, Mrs. Holly.</i>

49
00:02:08,001 --> 00:02:10,765
麦克连先生有没有打电话来？
Um, did Mr. McClane call?

50
00:02:10,871 --> 00:02:13,772
<i>没有，太太，没有打来
No, Mrs. Holly.
No telefono.</i>

51
00:02:13,874 --> 00:02:16,274
Well, he probably just
didn't have time...

52
00:02:16,376 --> 00:02:17,775
或者是赶飞机来不及
before his flight.

53
00:02:17,878 --> 00:02:20,608
把客房准备好以防万一
Um, make up
the spare bedroom...

54
00:02:20,714 --> 00:02:22,113
just in case.

55
00:02:22,215 --> 00:02:24,706
<i>知道，荷莉小姐
我已经准备好了
Si, Mrs. Holly.
I do that already.</i>

56
00:02:24,851 --> 00:02:27,684
没有你我也不知怎算好？波莉
What would I do
without you, Paulina?

57
00:02:47,807 --> 00:02:49,206
Oh!

58
00:02:52,812 --> 00:02:54,507
加州
California.

59
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,760
Hey, I'm John McClane.

60
00:03:08,862 --> 00:03:10,420
我是麦克连
Argyle.

61
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,327
艾加，我是司机
I'm your limo driver.

62
00:03:14,668 --> 00:03:16,693
Nice bear.

63
00:03:20,874 --> 00:03:22,705
这只熊仔很漂亮
好吧，现在要做些什么？
Okay... Argyle.

64
00:03:22,809 --> 00:03:25,277
What do we do now?

65
00:03:25,378 --> 00:03:27,141
本来希望你告诉我
You tell me.

66
00:03:27,247 --> 00:03:30,182
这是我第一次驾驶大房车
It's my first time
driving a limo.

67
00:03:30,283 --> 00:03:33,275
没关系，这也是我第一次坐
This is my first time
riding in one.

68
00:03:33,453 --> 00:03:36,354
放心，这辆车里面什么都有
Relax. We got everything
in this mug, man.

69
00:03:36,456 --> 00:03:39,687
你看CD，CB，电视，电话
Look at this...
CD, CB, TV,

70
00:03:39,793 --> 00:03:42,353
telephone, full bar, VHS.

71
00:03:42,462 --> 00:03:43,793
酒吧，录影机
[Laughs]

72
00:03:43,897 --> 00:03:46,195
若你朋友春心动又无聊的话
我还认识些“雌熊”能陪我们
If your friend's
hot to trot,

73
00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:48,699
I know a few
mama bears.

74
00:03:48,802 --> 00:03:50,702
Or is he married?

75
00:03:50,804 --> 00:03:52,203
他已婚了
他结婚了
He's married.

76
00:03:52,305 --> 00:03:53,704
好吧
Okay.

77
00:03:53,807 --> 00:03:55,707
Oh, sorry about that.

78
00:03:55,809 --> 00:03:57,709
对不起，工人放了假
It's the girl's day off.

79
00:03:57,811 --> 00:04:01,212
I didn't know
you were gonna sit up front.

80
00:04:01,314 --> 00:04:04,215
我不知道你会坐车头前座
你太太住这里？    六个月了
So, uh, your lady
live out here?

81
00:04:04,351 --> 00:04:06,251
About the past
six months.

82
00:04:06,353 --> 00:04:09,254
这表示你还住在纽约？
Meaning you still
live in New York?

83
00:04:09,356 --> 00:04:11,916
艾加
你常常都这么多问题吗？
You always ask
this many questions, Argyle?

84
00:04:12,058 --> 00:04:13,685
对不起，我以前是驾的士的
Sorry, man.
I used to drive a cab.

85
00:04:13,793 --> 00:04:15,556
客人喜欢闲聊
People would expect
a little chitchat.

86
00:04:15,662 --> 00:04:16,993
So you divorced?

87
00:04:17,097 --> 00:04:18,997
你离婚了？
Just drive the car, man.

88
00:04:19,099 --> 00:04:21,499
开你自己的车    别这样！
离婚还是分居？
Come on.
You divorced?

89
00:04:21,601 --> 00:04:23,865
还是被她打？
You separated?
She beat you up?

90
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,528
<i>[Laughing]</i>

91
00:04:25,638 --> 00:04:28,038
She had a good job.

92
00:04:28,141 --> 00:04:30,041
她有份好工作，变成了好事业
It turned into
a great career.

93
00:04:30,143 --> 00:04:33,044
<i>即是她要搬来这里？
That meant
she had to move here.</i>

94
00:04:33,146 --> 00:04:35,546
你反应很快啊！
You're very fast, Argyle.

95
00:04:35,648 --> 00:04:38,617
<i>那么你为什么不来呢？
So why didn't you come?</i>

96
00:04:40,687 --> 00:04:41,813
<i>你为什么不来呢？为什么？
Well?</i>

97
00:04:41,955 --> 00:04:43,445
What's up?

98
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,922
Because I'm
a New York cop.

99
00:04:46,026 --> 00:04:49,427
我是纽约警察
案件积压了六个月
I got a six-month backlog
of New York scumbags.

100
00:04:49,529 --> 00:04:52,657
还要去捉很多人
I can't just pick up
and go that easy.

101
00:04:52,766 --> 00:04:55,758
不是呼之则来
换句话说
以为她在这里不会成功
You thought
she wouldn't make it out here,

102
00:04:55,869 --> 00:04:58,269
会再返回你身边
为什么收拾行李？
so why bother
to pack, right?

103
00:04:58,371 --> 00:05:01,272
Like I said,
you're very fast, Argyle.

104
00:05:01,374 --> 00:05:04,400
我说过，你反应真的很快
艾加
You mind if we
hear some tunes?

105
00:05:04,511 --> 00:05:07,537
听点音乐好吗？

这才对！
Hey, that will work.

107
00:05:11,151 --> 00:05:14,382
Don't you got
any Christmas music?

108
00:05:14,521 --> 00:05:16,614
<i>你有圣诞歌吗？
这些就是圣诞音乐
This is Christmas music.</i>

109
00:05:18,425 --> 00:05:20,655
<i>∮It was December 24th

00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,194
<i>∮ When I seen a man chillin'
with his dog in the park ∮</i>

very slowly ∮</i>

112
00:05:25,231 --> 00:05:26,994
<i>∮ With my heart full of fear
looked at his dog ∮</i>

所以当你太太见到你时
So your lady sees you,
the music comes up,

124
00:05:49,856 --> 00:05:52,757
大家拥抱
音乐奏起，从此快乐过一生
and you live happily
ever after, right?

00:05:52,859 --> 00:05:54,759
这个我可以忍受
I can live with that.

126
00:05:54,861 --> 00:05:59,264
If it doesn't work out,
you got a place to stay?

127
00:05:59,365 --> 00:06:01,265
行不通的话，有地方住吗？
我会找个地方的
I'll find a place.

128

不如这样
Tell you what.

129
00:06:02,802 --> 00:06:05,100
I'll wait
in the parking garage.

130
00:06:05,205 --> 00:06:07,696
我去停车场等一下
成功了就致电到车上的电话
You score, you call
on the car phone.

131
00:06:07,807 --> 00:06:10,935
You strike out,
I'll get you a hotel.

132
00:06:11,044 --> 00:06:13,069
我就回去
失败了我就送你去酒店
You're all right, Argyle.

133
00:06:13,179 --> 00:06:17,240
你真尽责，艾加
给小费时别忘了这一点
Just remember that
when you sign for the tip.

134
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,368
