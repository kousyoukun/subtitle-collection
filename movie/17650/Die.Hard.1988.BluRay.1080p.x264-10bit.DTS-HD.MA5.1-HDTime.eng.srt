1
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:59,885
You don't like flying, do you?

2
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:02,359
What gives you that idea?

3
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:05,396
You want to know the secret...

4
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:09,127
to surviving air travel?

5
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,327
After you get
where you're going,

6
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:11,961
take off your shoes and socks.

7
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,835
Then walk around,

8
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,602
making fists
with your toes.

9
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:18,609
Fists with your toes?

10
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:21,613
It sounds crazy,

11
00:01:21,714 --> 00:01:24,649
but I've been doing it
for nine years.

12
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,686
Better than a shower
and a cup of coffee.

13
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:30,313
Okay.

14
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:41,962
It's okay.
I'm a cop.

15
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:45,194
Trust me.

16
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:48,341
I've been doing this
for 11 years.

17
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,909
<i>On behalf of
the captain and crew,</i>

18
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,877
<i>we'd like to welcome you
to Los Angeles.</i>

19
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,880
<i>Have a very Merry Christmas.</i>

20
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:14,665
<i>Flight 227 to Tucson
now boarding at gate 14.</i>

21
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,838
Ah.

22
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,350
How do you do?

23
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:44,695
Ladies and gentlemen.

24
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:46,697
Ladies and gentlemen!

25
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:50,701
I want to congratulate
each and every one of you...

26
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:53,704
for making this
one of the greatest years...

27
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:56,707
in the history
of the Nakatomi Corporation.

28
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:01,144
On behalf of
the chief executive officer,

29
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:04,148
Mr. Ozu,
and the board of directors,

30
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,650
we wish you
a Merry Christmas...

31
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:08,812
and a Happy New Year!

32
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:10,321
Merry Christmas!

33
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:12,152
Happy New Year!

34
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:13,657
Hey, Holly,

35
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,159
what about
dinner tonight, huh?

36
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:18,162
Harry, it's Christmas Eve.

37
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:21,165
Families, stockings...

38
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:24,660
chestnuts...

39
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:26,170
Rudolph and Frosty.

40
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:29,173
Any of these things
ring a bell?

41
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:31,175
Actually, I was
thinking more...

42
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:34,178
of mulled wine,
a nice aged brie,

43
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,180
and a roaring fireplace.

44
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:38,182
You know what I'm saying?

45
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,186
Ginny, it's 5:40.

46
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:45,189
Go join the party.
Have some champagne.

47
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:48,192
You're making me feel
like Ebenezer Scrooge.

48
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:51,195
Can the baby
handle a little sip?

49
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:53,697
That baby's ready
to tend bar.

50
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,825
Last chance.

51
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:57,027
Bye.

52
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:06,701
McClane residence.
Lucy McClane speaking.

53
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:08,303
Hello, Lucy McClane.

54
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,314
This is
your mother speaking.

55
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,815
Mommy!

56
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,818
When are you
coming home?

57
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,820
Pretty soon.
Pretty soon.

58
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:19,323
You'll be in bed
when I get there, though.

59
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,325
Let me talk to Paulina.

60
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,827
And no snooping
around the house,

61
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,363
looking for presents.

62
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:27,831
Is Daddy coming home
with you?

63
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,003
Well, we'll see what...

64
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,505
Santa and Mommy
can do, okay?

65
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,507
Put Paulina on.
Bye, honey.

66
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,201
Paulina!

67
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,308
<i>Hola, Mrs. Holly.</i>

68
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:48,182
Um, did Mr. McClane call?

69
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,189
<i>No, Mrs. Holly.
No telefono.</i>

70
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,691
Well, he probably just
didn't have time...

71
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,192
before his flight.

72
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,025
Um, make up
the spare bedroom...

73
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,530
just in case.

74
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:02,192
<i>Si, Mrs. Holly.
I do that already.</i>

75
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,135
What would I do
without you, Paulina?

76
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:26,657
Oh!

77
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:31,958
California.

78
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:46,177
Hey, I'm John McClane.

79
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,837
Argyle.

80
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:49,744
I'm your limo driver.

81
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:54,110
Nice bear.

82
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,191
Okay... Argyle.

83
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:02,761
What do we do now?

84
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,625
You tell me.

85
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:07,666
It's my first time
driving a limo.

86
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:10,759
This is my first time
riding in one.

87
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:13,804
Relax. We got everything
in this mug, man.

88
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:17,137
Look at this-
CD, CB, TV,

89
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:19,803
telephone, full bar, VHS.

90
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:23,645
If your friend's
hot to trot,

91
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,150
I know a few
mama bears.

92
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:28,152
Or is he married?

93
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:29,653
He's married.

94
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:31,155
Okay.

95
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:33,157
Oh, sorry about that.

96
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:35,159
It's the girl's day off.

97
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:38,662
I didn't know
you were gonna sit up front.

98
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:41,666
So, uh, your lady
live out here?

99
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:43,668
About the past
six months.

100
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,671
Meaning you still
live in New York?

101
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:49,367
You always ask
this many questions, Argyle?

102
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:51,102
Sorry, man.
I used to drive a cab.

103
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,973
People would expect
a little chitchat.

104
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,410
So you divorced?

105
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:56,414
Just drive the car, man.

106
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:58,916
Come on.
You divorced?

107
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:01,350
You separated?
She beat you up?

108
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:05,522
She had a good job.

109
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,525
It turned into
a great career.

110
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:10,528
<i>That meant
she had to move here.</i>

111
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,030
You're very fast, Argyle.

112
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:16,067
<i>So why didn't you come?</i>

113
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:19,297
<i>Well?</i>

114
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:20,929
What's up?

115
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,372
Because I'm
a New York cop.

116
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:26,877
I got a six-month backlog
of New York scumbags.

117
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:30,107
I can't just pick up
and go that easy.

118
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:33,208
You thought
she wouldn't make it out here,

119
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,719
so why bother
to pack, right?

120
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:38,723
Like I said,
you're very fast, Argyle.

121
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:41,851
You mind if we
hear some tunes?

122
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:48,464
Hey, that will work.

123
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:51,833
Don't you got
any Christmas music?

124
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:54,065
<i>This is Christmas music.</i>

125
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:27,204
So your lady sees you,
the music comes up,

126
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:30,207
and you live happily
ever after, right?

127
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:32,209
I can live with that.

128
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:36,714
If it doesn't work out,
you got a place to stay?

129
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:38,716
I'll find a place.

130
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:40,149
Tell you what.

131
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,551
I'll wait
in the parking garage.

132
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:45,146
You score, you call
on the car phone.

133
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:48,386
You strike out,
I'll get you a hotel.

134
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:50,519
You're all right, Argyle.

135
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:54,691
Just remember that
when you sign for the tip.

136
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:18,851
Hi.

137
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,357
Good evening.

138
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:22,859
I'm here to see
Holly McClane.

139
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,862
Just type it in there.

140
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:32,164
Cute toy.

141
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:35,570
If you have to
take a leak,

142
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:37,540
it finds
your zipper.

143
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:53,051
Christ.

144
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,064
30th floor.

145
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,531
The party.

146
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:04,398
They're the only ones
left in the building.

147
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:05,902
Take the express elevator...

148
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:07,905
until you hear the noise.

149
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:09,406
Thanks.

150
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,564
Champagne, sir?

151
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,066
Yeah, thanks.

152
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,232
Oh, I'm sorry.

153
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:49,068
Hey, Merry Christmas!

154
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:54,244
Jesus.

155
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:56,746
Fuckin' California.

156
00:11:58,017 --> 00:12:01,176
Why don't
I talk to him right now?

157
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:02,345
Hi.

158
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:03,683
I'm looking for-

159
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:05,017
Holly Gennero.

160
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:06,216
Yeah.

161
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:08,190
You must be
John McClane.

162
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:09,693
Joe Takagi.

163
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:11,695
How was your ride in?

164
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:13,697
I have you to thank?

165
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:16,199
Seemed the least
we could do.

166
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:18,702
Quite a place
you have here.

167
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:20,203
It will be.

168
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:21,705
Several floors are
under construction.

169
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:24,207
Holly went to fax
some documents.

170
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,709
In the meanwhile,

171
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:27,711
her office is
right back here.

172
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:31,946
<i>Ellis.</i>

173
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:35,817
I was just making a call.

174
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:39,584
I want you to meet
John McClane,

175
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,057
Holly's husband-

176
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,388
Holly's policeman.

177
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:45,225
Ellis is in charge of
international development.

178
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:48,232
Heard a heck of a lot
about you.

179
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:50,268
Missed some.

180
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,570
Can I get you anything?

181
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:55,071
Food? Cake?

182
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:57,074
Some watered-down
champagne?

183
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:59,235
No, thank you.
I'm fine.

184
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:01,677
You throw quite a party.

185
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,180
I didn't realize...

186
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,512
they celebrated
Christmas in Japan.

187
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,518
Pearl Harbor
didn't work out,

188
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,681
so we got you
with tape decks.

189
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:15,022
Actually, it's sort of
a double celebration.

190
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:18,824
Holly helped us close
a big deal today.

191
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:22,196
<i>I'll be out in
a couple of minutes.</i>

192
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:27,706
John.

193
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:33,200
Have you met everyone?

194
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,712
We've been
sticking him with spears.

195
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,715
Of course, he has.

196
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,217
She was made
for the business.

197
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,718
Tough as nails.

198
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,220
I was hoping...

199
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,721
you made that flight.

200
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,724
Show him the watch.

201
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:47,884
Later.

202
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,392
Go on.
Show him.

203
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,860
What, are you
embarrassed?

204
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:54,023
<i>A token of appreciation
for her hard work.</i>

205
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:55,725
It's a Rolex.

206
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,235
I'm sure
I'll see it later.

207
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:01,465
Is there a place
where I could wash up?

208
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:04,008
Sure.

209
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,723
Ellis gets very depressed...

210
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:22,384
this time of year.

211
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:25,361
He thought he was
God's greatest gift.

212
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:27,364
Yeah.
I know the type.

213
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:30,867
Think he's got
his eye on you.

214
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,369
That's okay...

215
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:33,870
I have my eye...

216
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:35,372
on his private bathroom.

217
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:36,873
Where you staying?

218
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:38,876
Things happened so fast,

219
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:41,879
I didn't get
a chance to ask you.

220
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:44,711
Cappy Roberts
retired out here.

221
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:47,547
He told me
I could bunk with him.

222
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:50,383
Cappy retired, huh?
Where's he live?

223
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:51,649
Ramona.

224
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:53,850
Pomona.

225
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:55,051

228
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,564
Yeah.

229
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:02,498
You'll be in the car
half the time.

230
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:04,000
Why don't we make it easy?

231
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:06,663
I have a spare bedroom.

232
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:09,468
It's not huge
or anything, but...

233
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,976
the kids would love
to have you at the house.

234
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,171
They would, huh?

235
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:20,013
I would, too.

236
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:23,846
Ooh!

237
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:25,890
Sorry.

238
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:34,198
I missed you.

239
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,004
I guess you didn't
miss my name, though, huh?

240
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:48,045
Except maybe when
you're signing checks?

241
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,172
Since when are you
" Ms. Gennero"?

- Are we going to have this conversation again?

- Right, no matter what the consequences.

247
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:09,463
- No matter what it did to our marriage.
- It didn't do anything...

248
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:11,729
except change your idea
of what our marriage should be.

249
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:14,829
- You don't have a clue what my idea of our marriage should be.
- I know exactly...

250
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,306
what your idea

251

00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:41,752
I could talk about industrialization
and men's fashions all day,

335
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:43,878
but I'm afraid
work must intrude,

336
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:46,513
and my associate here
has some questions for you.

337
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:51,118
Sort of fill-in-the-blanks
questions, actually.

338
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:02,299
I don't have that code!

339
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:05,137
You broke in here
to access our computer?

340
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:10,337
Any information you could get, when
they wake up in Tokyo, they'll change it.

341
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:13,315
<i>You won't be able to blackmail
our executives, threaten our pro-</i>

342
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,477
Sit... down!

343
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:28,028
Mr. Takagi,
I'm really not interested...

344
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:29,657
in your computer.

345
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:36,172
But I need the code key...

346
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:40,176
<i>because I am interested
in the $640 million...</i>

347
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,178
in negotiable bearer bonds...

348
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,181
that you have
locked in your vault.

349
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:49,447
And the computer
controls the vault.

350
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:51,681
You want money?

351
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:55,453
What kind
of terrorists are you?

352
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:01,197
Who said
we were terrorists?

353
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:24,654
<i>The bonds represent
at most ten days'...</i>

354
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:27,224
<i>operating capital
for your parent organization.</i>

355
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:38,061
The code, please.

356
00:30:38,703 --> 00:30:39,931
It's useless to you.

357
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:43,997
There are seven vault safeguards,
and the code key's only one of them.

358
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:45,939
You'll never get it open.

359
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:48,945
Then there's no reason
not to tell us.

360
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:50,241
I told you.

361
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:52,441
It's not over yet.

362
00:30:57,055 --> 00:30:58,955
It's a very nice suit...

363
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:01,048
Mr. Takagi.

364
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:03,889
It would be a shame
to ruin it.

365
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:09,626
I'm going to
count to three.

366
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:12,703
<i>There will not be a four.</i>

367
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:14,431
Give me...

368
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:17,406
the code.

369
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:18,907
One...

370
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:22,946
<i>Two...</i>

371
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:27,041
- Three.
- I don't know it. I'm telling you!

372
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:28,743
Get on the jet to Tokyo
and ask the chairman.

373
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:31,686
I'm telling you.
You're just gonna have to kill me.

374
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:32,983
Okay.

375
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,526
We'll do it
the hard way.

376
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,621
Tony, see if you
can dispose of that.

377
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,997
Karl, better check
on Heinrich's work.

378
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,350
Nothing.

379
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:12,326
See to Heinrich.

380
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,331
Now...

381
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:18,334
you can
break the code?

382
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,336
You didn't
bring me along...

383
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,338
for my charming
personality.

384
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,848
Argyle, tell me
you heard the shots.

385
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,679
You're callin'
the police right now.

386
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:36,844
Of course
I'm coming by later.

387
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,355
Have I ever lied to you?

388
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:42,790
My boss?
Thinks I'm on my way to Vegas.

389
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:46,352
Uli, get up on the pipes.

390
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:49,365
Marco, you go
through here.

391
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:52,368
I'll throw you the cord.

392
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,669
Hans, we're on the roof.

393
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:13,315
Here.

394
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:27,835
Thirty minutes
to break the code,

395
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:30,840
Two hours, two and a half hours
for the five mechanicals...

396
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:32,341
at the minimum.

397
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:35,844
The seventh lock,
however, is out of my hands.

398
00:33:58,403 --> 00:33:59,870
I'm sorry-

399
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:02,303
The seventh lock-
the electromagnetic seal.

400
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:03,772
You do understand...

401
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,706
the circuits cannot
be cut locally.

402
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:09,505
Trust me.

403
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,877
Why the fuck
didn't you stop him,John?

404
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:17,386
'Cause then
you'd be dead, too, asshole!

405
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:19,388
Think, goddamn it!
Think!

406
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:33,800
We've got a fire alarm.

407
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,395
Call 911.

408
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:39,408
Give them the guard's name
and the building code number,

409
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,569
and cancel the alarm.

410
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,408
Then disable the system.

411
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:47,814
On what floor
did the alarm go off?

412
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,920
Now, shall we go?

413
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:53,422
<i>Nein.</i>

414
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:06,869
Oh, baby, come to Papa.

415
00:35:06,971 --> 00:35:08,370
Come on.

416
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:16,772
Come on, baby.
Come to Papa.

417
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:18,872
<i>I'll kiss
your fuckin'dalmatian.</i>

418
00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:23,783
You stupid motherfuckers!
No!

419
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:27,255
Turn the fuckin' truck around!

420
00:36:00,024 --> 00:36:03,858
The fire has been
called off, my friend.

421
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:10,365
No one is coming to help you.

422
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:17,600
You might as well
come out and join the others.

423
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:22,377
I promise
I won't hurt you.

424
00:36:51,642 --> 00:36:53,906
Drop it, dickhead.
It's the police.

425
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:55,911
You won't hurt me.

426
00:36:56,013 --> 00:36:57,412
Yeah? Why not?

427
00:36:57,515 --> 00:36:59,915
Because
you're a policeman.

428
00:37:00,017 --> 00:37:02,349
There are rules
for policemen.

429
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:06,822
Yeah. That's what
my captain keeps telling me.

430
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:34,383
Aah!

431
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:15,650
You bet your ass
I wish to proceed.

432
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,828
Nine million terrorists
in the world,

433
00:38:57,935 --> 00:39:01,166
and I got to kill one
with feet smaller than my sister.

434
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:52,720
I wanted this
to be professional,

435
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:55,291
efficient, and cooperative.

436
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,520
Not a lot to ask.

437
00:39:57,628 --> 00:40:00,529
Alas, Mr. Takagi
did not see it that way,

438
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:05,534
so he won't be joining us
for the rest of his life.

439
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:08,537
<i>We can go
any way you want it.</i>

440
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:11,403
<i>You can walk out
or be carried out,</i>

441
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:15,673
but have no illusions-
we are in charge.

442
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:21,184
<i>So... decide now, each of you,</i>

443
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:22,946
<i>And please remember...</i>

444
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:26,681
<i>we have left nothing
to chance.</i>

445
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:36,357
Get them back!

446
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:48,506
" Now I have
a machine gun.

447
00:40:50,314 --> 00:40:53,442
<i>Ho-ho-ho. "</i>

448
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,220
A security guard
we missed?

449
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:01,155
They're usually
just growing fat on a pension.

450
00:41:01,258 --> 00:41:03,658
This is
something else.

451
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:15,161
We have to do
something, Hans.

452
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:16,796
Yes, we do.

453
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:19,432
Tell Karl his brother is dead.

454
00:41:19,543 --> 00:41:21,408
Tell him
to come down.

455
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:24,003
<i>Karl...
komm sofort.</i>

456
00:41:24,114 --> 00:41:29,677
<i>Franco,you and Fritz take
the body upstairs and out of sight.</i>

457
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:31,846
<i>I don't want the hostages
to think too much.</i>

458
00:42:34,685 --> 00:42:36,152
Aah!

459
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:37,982
I want blood!

460
00:42:38,088 --> 00:42:40,682
But let Heinrich
plant the detonators.

461
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:43,692
The police will waste hours
trying to negotiate.

462
00:42:43,794 --> 00:42:46,695
Then you can
tear the building apart.

463
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:50,028
But until then,
do not alter the plan.

464
00:42:50,134 --> 00:42:52,659
And if he alters it?

465
00:42:56,807 --> 00:42:58,900
What do you think?

466
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,145
Something's wrong.

467
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:04,646
Cops?

468
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,649
John.

469
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:11,016
<i>John-Aw, Christ!
He can fuck this whole thing up!</i>

470
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:13,112
<i>What does
he think he's doing?</i>

471
00:43:13,223 --> 00:43:14,520
His job.

472
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:17,025
Bullshit. His job's
3,000 miles away.

473
00:43:17,127 --> 00:43:21,530
Without him, we might
be able to get out of here.

474
00:43:21,632 --> 00:43:25,033
Tell that to Takagi.

475
00:43:48,158 --> 00:43:50,888
Mayday. Mayday,
Anyone copying channel nine.

476
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:53,395
Terrorists have seized
the Nakatomi Building...

477
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:54,987
<i>and are holding
30 hostages.</i>

478
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:57,192
<i>Unknown number
of terrorists-</i>

479
00:43:57,301 --> 00:44:00,600
Six or more armed
with automatic weapons.

480
00:44:00,704 --> 00:44:03,901
Where's the best place
to transmit?

481
00:44:04,008 --> 00:44:05,339
<i>- Somebody answer me, goddamn it!
- The roof!</i>

482
00:44:05,442 --> 00:44:06,909
<i>Go! Go!</i>

483
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,914
<i>It's the same
address as that fire signal.</i>

484
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:13,415
I'll handle it.

485
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:17,419
Attention,
whoever you are,

486
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:19,921
this channel
is reserved for emergencies.

487
00:44:20,024 --> 00:44:21,491
No shit, lady!

488
00:44:21,592 --> 00:44:23,492
I'm not ordering
a pizza!

489
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:37,936
No one kills him
but me.

490
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,944
They have
killed one hostage.

491
00:44:42,046 --> 00:44:43,775
They are fortifying
their positions...

492
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:45,348
while you're jerking
me off on the radio!

493
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:47,440
Sir, I've
already told you.

494
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:49,451
This is
a reserved channel.

495
00:44:49,553 --> 00:44:52,954
If this is
an emergency call, dial 911.

496
00:44:53,057 --> 00:44:57,016
Otherwise, I'll report
this as an FCC violation.

497
00:44:57,127 --> 00:45:01,120
Fine! Come and arrest me,
just send the police now!

498
00:45:02,733 --> 00:45:04,098
Ow!

499
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:19,344
See if there's a
black-and-white to do a drive-by.

500
00:45:29,526 --> 00:45:31,858
Thought you guys
just ate doughnuts.

501
00:45:31,962 --> 00:45:34,487
They're for my wife.

502
00:45:34,598 --> 00:45:36,532
Yeah.

503
00:45:36,633 --> 00:45:38,464
She's pregnant.

504
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,093
Yeah.

505
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:42,968
Bag it.

506
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:44,973
Big time.

507
00:45:47,644 --> 00:45:49,043
Thanks.

508
00:45:52,149 --> 00:45:54,549
Dispatch
to 8-Lincoln-30. Over.

509
00:45:54,651 --> 00:45:57,051
This is 8-Lincoln-30.
Come on in. Over.

510
00:45:57,154 --> 00:45:58,553
Investigate a Code 2...

511
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,555
at Nakatomi Plaza,
Century City.

512
00:46:00,657 --> 00:46:02,323
8- Lincoln-30 to dispatch.
I'm on my way.

513
00:46:02,358 --> 00:46:03,989
8- Lincoln-30 to dispatch.
I'm on my way.

514
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:03,978
Girls.

515
00:48:19,596 --> 00:48:23,396
Shit! Where the fuck?

516
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:45,520
Oh, my God.

517
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:03,471
He's in the elevator shaft.

518
00:49:05,175 --> 00:49:07,473
Perfect.
The elevators are locked off.

519
00:49:07,577 --> 00:49:10,341
Just shut him in
and come back down.

520
00:49:14,084 --> 00:49:15,483
Oh, fuck.

521
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:23,756
Karl, the police
are probably...

522
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:25,725
on their way already.

523
00:49:46,616 --> 00:49:48,015
Christ.

524
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:55,588
I can stall them but not
if they hear gunshots.

525
00:49:55,692 --> 00:49:58,160
If you lock him in,
he'll be neutralized-

526
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:04,721
Come out to the coast!

527
00:51:04,828 --> 00:51:06,955
We'll get together,
have a few laughs.

528
00:51:14,004 --> 00:51:17,667
Now I know
what a TV dinner feels like.

529
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:28,950
<i>Such!</i>

530
00:52:24,608 --> 00:52:26,769
<i>Karl, komm!
Die polizei!</i>

531
00:52:26,877 --> 00:52:28,504
<i>Die polizei!</i>

532
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:14,722
Well, it's about time.

533
00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:22,730
No signs
of disturbance, dispatch.

534
00:53:22,832 --> 00:53:24,629
Possible crank call.

535
00:53:24,734 --> 00:53:26,725
<i>Check the area
and confirm.</i>

536
00:53:32,676 --> 00:53:35,474
Who's driving this car?
Stevie Wonder?

537
00:53:37,247 --> 00:53:39,340
I see a guard inside.

538
00:53:39,449 --> 00:53:42,247
<i>I'm going in
for a closer look.</i>

539
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:43,751
<i>Use caution.</i>

540
00:53:46,856 --> 00:53:48,153
Eddie?

541
00:53:48,258 --> 00:53:50,749
I had a feelin'
you'd be callin'.

542
00:54:13,817 --> 00:54:16,843
Evenin', Officer.
What can I do for you?

543
00:54:25,328 --> 00:54:28,263
Heh heh heh!

544
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:31,232
We had
that false alarm, you know.

545
00:54:31,334 --> 00:54:33,234
That computer
sent you out...

546
00:54:33,336 --> 00:54:35,236
on another
wild-goose chase.

547
00:54:35,338 --> 00:54:36,737
They been chasing bugs...

548
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,740
since they installed
this system.

549
00:54:38,842 --> 00:54:40,742
<i>Notre Dame
on top of USC-</i>

550
00:54:40,844 --> 00:54:42,311
Ah, shit!

551
00:54:42,412 --> 00:54:44,972
I got 50 bucks bet
on them assholes.

552
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:50,711
<i>Come on, come on.
Where's the fucking cavalry?</i>

553
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:57,986
Ah!

554
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:13,901
Bah!

555
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:16,035
<i>...was good for 52 yards.</i>

556
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:18,046
Mind if I look around?

557
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:20,048
Help yourself.

558
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,550
<i>Seven seconds left
in this period.</i>

559
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:26,088
<i>Seven to nothing,
Notre Dame.</i>

560
00:55:29,693 --> 00:55:31,558
Freeze, Motherfucker!

561
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:32,992
Don't shoot!

562
00:55:33,096 --> 00:55:34,427
Drop it!

563
00:55:34,531 --> 00:55:35,930
Okay! Don't shoot!

564
00:55:36,032 --> 00:55:37,056
Drop it!

565
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:38,691
Ah!

566
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:56,584
Ah, the hell with this!

567
00:55:58,355 --> 00:55:59,879
Ah!

568
00:56:03,393 --> 00:56:05,361
Ah!

569
00:56:05,462 --> 00:56:08,022
You are dog now!

570
00:56:08,131 --> 00:56:11,157
No more table!
Where are you going, pal?

571
00:56:11,267 --> 00:56:13,861
Next time
you have a chance...

572
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:15,494
to kill someone,

573
00:56:15,605 --> 00:56:17,766
don't hesitate.

574
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:24,911
Thanks for the advice.

575
00:56:25,014 --> 00:56:26,914
Sorry to waste your time.

576
00:56:27,016 --> 00:56:28,415
No problem.

577
00:56:28,518 --> 00:56:29,951
Merry Christmas.

578
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:31,350
Merry Christmas.

579
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:47,665
For the love-

580
00:56:50,306 --> 00:56:52,171
8- Lincoln-30
to dispatch.

581
00:56:52,275 --> 00:56:53,674
Go ahead.

582
00:56:53,777 --> 00:56:55,677
That's a wild-goose chase...

583
00:56:55,779 --> 00:56:57,178
here at Nakatomi Plaza.

584
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,180
Everything here's okay.
Over.

585
00:57:08,458 --> 00:57:10,085
Goddamn it!
Jesus H. Christ!

586
00:57:17,867 --> 00:57:19,960
Welcome
to the party, pal!

587
00:57:20,069 --> 00:57:21,764
Goddamn it!

588
00:57:28,411 --> 00:57:33,007
Police under automatic
rifle fire at Nakatomi!

589
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:35,107
I need back-up assistance now!

590
00:57:35,218 --> 00:57:37,709
Now, Goddamn it! Now!

591
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:59,002
Monica,
I can get us a table.

592
00:57:59,108 --> 00:58:01,941
Wolfgang and I
are very close friends.

593
00:58:02,045 --> 00:58:04,445
I interviewed him,
for God's sake.

594
00:58:04,547 --> 00:58:05,946
<i>...Nakatomi.</i>

595
00:58:06,049 --> 00:58:07,949
<i>Repeat.
Officer needs assistance at-</i>

596
00:58:08,051 --> 00:58:12,454
<i>I'm at Nakatomi Plaza. They're
turning my car into Swiss cheese!</i>

597
00:58:12,555 --> 00:58:14,455
<i>I need
back-up assistance now!</i>

598
00:58:14,557 --> 00:58:16,616
<i>Now, Goddamn it! Now!</i>

599
00:58:36,579 --> 00:58:39,639
Never thought I'd love
to hear that sound.

600
00:58:39,749 --> 00:58:41,717
All of you relax.

601
00:58:41,818 --> 00:58:44,719
This is a matter
of inconvenient timing.

602
00:58:44,821 --> 00:58:46,721
Police action was inevitable...

603
00:58:46,823 --> 00:58:49,223
and, as it happens,
necessary.

604
00:58:49,325 --> 00:58:52,226
Let them fumble about outside,
and stay calm.

605
00:58:52,328 --> 00:58:53,989
This is simply the beginning.

606
00:58:55,298 --> 00:58:59,564
I thought I told all of you
I want radio silence.

607
00:58:59,669 --> 00:59:02,263
I didn't get
that message, Hans.

608
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:05,739
You should have put it
on the bulletin board.

609
00:59:05,842 --> 00:59:09,141
Since I waxed Tony and Marco
and his friend,

610
00:59:09,245 --> 00:59:13,375
I figured you and Karl
and Franco might be lonely.

611
00:59:13,483 --> 00:59:16,145
How does he know
so much-

612
00:59:16,252 --> 00:59:19,619
That's very kind of you.

613
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:22,623
I assume you are
our mysterious party crasher.

614
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:26,923
You are most troublesome
for a security guard.

615
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:29,828
Eeeh! Sorry, Hans.
Wrong guess.

616
00:59:29,933 --> 00:59:32,595
Want to go
for DoubleJeopardy,

617
00:59:32,702 --> 00:59:35,170
where the scores
can really change?

618
00:59:37,273 --> 00:59:40,106
Mm, these are
very bad for you.

619
00:59:40,209 --> 00:59:42,575
Who are you, then?

620
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:45,170
The fly in
the ointment, Hans.

621
00:59:45,281 --> 00:59:47,181
The monkey
in the wrench,

622
00:59:47,283 --> 00:59:49,183
the pain in the ass.

623
00:59:50,653 --> 00:59:52,177
Whoa!

624
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:56,024
Don't use the radio.

625
00:59:56,125 --> 01:00:00,186
See if he's lying about Marco.
Find out who's missing.

626
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:05,958
Mr. Mystery Guest,

627
01:00:06,069 --> 01:00:08,469
are you still there?

628
01:00:08,571 --> 01:00:10,471
Yeah, I'm still here,

629
01:00:10,573 --> 01:00:14,475
unless you want to open
the front door for me.

630
01:00:14,577 --> 01:00:16,044
I'm afraid not,

631
01:00:16,145 --> 01:00:18,045
but you have me
at a loss.

632
01:00:18,147 --> 01:00:20,741
You know my name,
but who are you?

633
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:22,681
Just another American...

634
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:25,481
who saw too many movies
as a child?

635
01:00:25,588 --> 01:00:28,022
Another orphan
of a bankrupt culture...

636
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:31,423
who thinks he's
John Wayne, Rambo,

637
01:00:31,527 --> 01:00:32,994
Marshal Dillon?

638
01:00:33,096 --> 01:00:35,997
I was always partial
to Roy Rogers, actually.

639
01:00:36,099 --> 01:00:38,090
I liked those
sequined shirts.

640
01:00:38,201 --> 01:00:41,261
Do you think you have
a chance, Mr. Cowboy?

641
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:46,798
Yippee-kai-yay,
motherfucker.

642
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,846
I can get the jump
on everybody...

643
01:00:52,949 --> 01:00:54,610
with a remote.

644
01:00:54,717 --> 01:00:56,708
Harvey,
keep your pants on.

645
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:58,719
Sam, I'm begging you.

646
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:01,153
Simon's already out
with the remote.

647
01:01:01,257 --> 01:01:05,159
I'm not sitting on this!
I am going out there!

648
01:01:05,261 --> 01:01:07,661
You don't give me a truck,

649
01:01:07,764 --> 01:01:09,664
I'll steal a truck.

650
01:01:09,766 --> 01:01:12,132
Give us a break,
Thornburg.

651
01:01:12,235 --> 01:01:13,395
Eat it, Harvey!

652
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:15,835
Four, three, two...

653
01:01:15,938 --> 01:01:17,462
one.

654
01:01:17,573 --> 01:01:19,473
<i>Harvey, we're
on the air.</i>

655
01:01:22,445 --> 01:01:25,608
Good evening.
This is HarveyJohnson.

656
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:29,577
And I'm Gail Wallens,

657
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:32,211
<i>and this is
Nightline News at 10:00.</i>

658
01:01:32,321 --> 01:01:35,222
<i>Our top stories
on this Christmas eve-</i>

659
01:01:35,324 --> 01:01:38,225
Take truck number five.
Get out of here.

660
01:01:44,567 --> 01:01:46,660
He wasn't lying
about Marco.

661
01:01:46,769 --> 01:01:48,828
He's down
on the street.

662
01:01:48,938 --> 01:01:51,099
<i>The other man
was Heinrich,</i>

663
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:53,698
and his bag
is missing.

664
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:56,608
He had the detonator.

665
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:02,483
Theo.

666
01:02:02,585 --> 01:02:03,609
Theo.

667
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:04,948
Yo!

668
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:06,954
We may have
some problems.

669
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:08,956
How's your schedule?

670
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:10,958
Three down.
Four to go.

671
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:13,961
Then don't waste time
talking to me.

672
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:16,964
This is sergeant Al Powell
of the L.A.P.D.

673
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:20,229
If the person
who radioed can hear me,

674
01:02:20,336 --> 01:02:22,702
acknowledge
this transmission.

675
01:02:22,805 --> 01:02:24,636
I say again-

676
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:27,972
If the person who radioed
can hear me,

677
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:30,477
acknowledge
this transmission!

678
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:37,541
I read you.
You the guy in the car?

679
01:02:37,653 --> 01:02:39,553
What's left of him.

680
01:02:39,655 --> 01:02:41,589
Can you identify
yourself?

681
01:02:41,691 --> 01:02:43,591
Not now.
Maybe later.

682
01:02:43,693 --> 01:02:45,593
This is a party line.

683
01:02:45,695 --> 01:02:48,095
The neighbor's got
itchy trigger fingers.

684
01:02:48,197 --> 01:02:50,825
You got 30 hostages
on the 30th floor.

685
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:54,425
<i>- The leader's name is Hans.
- We have to find him and shut him up.</i>

686
01:02:54,537 --> 01:02:56,437
- He's telling them everything!
- Let him. I'm waiting for the FBI.

687
01:02:56,539 --> 01:02:58,769
Until then, he can waste
as much time as he likes,

688
01:02:58,875 --> 01:03:02,936
but we must find
the bag, Fritz.

689
01:03:03,045 --> 01:03:05,343
We must have
the detonators.

690
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:07,439
<i>They got
missiles, automatic weapons,</i>

691
01:03:07,550 --> 01:03:10,041
<i>and enough explosives
to orbit Arnold Schwarzenegger.</i>

692
01:03:10,153 --> 01:03:12,451
They're down to nine now.

693
01:03:12,555 --> 01:03:14,955
These guys
are mostly European,

694
01:03:15,057 --> 01:03:17,457
judging by
their clothing labels and...

695
01:03:24,901 --> 01:03:26,300
cigarettes.

696
01:03:26,402 --> 01:03:28,962
They're well-financed
and very slick.

697
01:03:29,071 --> 01:03:30,971
How do you
know that?

698
01:03:31,073 --> 01:03:32,563
I've seen
enough phony I.D.s...

699
01:03:32,675 --> 01:03:37,635
to recognize that the ones
they got must have cost a fortune.

700
01:03:37,747 --> 01:03:39,146
Add all that up,

701
01:03:39,248 --> 01:03:41,079
I don't know
what the fuck it means,

702
01:03:41,184 --> 01:03:44,779
but you got some bad-ass
perpetrators here to stay.

703
01:03:44,887 --> 01:03:47,082
I hear you, partner.

704
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:49,420
L.A.'s finest are on it.

705
01:03:49,525 --> 01:03:52,016
Light 'em
if you got 'em.

706
01:03:52,128 --> 01:03:54,426
Way ahead of you, partner.

707
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:57,931
So, what do I call you?

708
01:03:58,034 --> 01:03:59,934
Call me...

709
01:04:01,204 --> 01:04:02,296
Roy.

710
01:04:02,405 --> 01:04:04,930
If you think of
anything else,

711
01:04:05,041 --> 01:04:06,941
don't you be shy, okay?

712
01:04:07,043 --> 01:04:10,444
In the meantime,
let us do our job.

713
01:04:10,546 --> 01:04:12,446
<i>They're all yours, Al.</i>

714
01:04:30,066 --> 01:04:32,534
All right,
who's talking to him?

715
01:04:32,635 --> 01:04:35,968
I am, sir. Sergeant Powell.
Al Powell.

716
01:04:36,072 --> 01:04:38,973
Dwayne Robinson, Powell.
What's the deal here?

717
01:04:39,075 --> 01:04:40,906
What do
these pricks want?

718
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:42,910
Well, we don't exactly know.

719
01:04:43,012 --> 01:04:44,912
We haven't heard from them.

720
01:04:45,014 --> 01:04:47,448
Who have you been talking to?

721
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:51,077
We don't know.
He won't give us his name.

722
01:04:51,187 --> 01:04:54,088
He appears to be
the one who phoned.

723
01:04:54,190 --> 01:04:55,919
He's killed
one terrorist,

724
01:04:56,025 --> 01:04:57,583
and he claims two others.

725
01:04:57,693 --> 01:05:00,594
Claims? Powell,
has it occurred to you...

726
01:05:00,696 --> 01:05:03,494
he could be one
of the terrorists...

727
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:05,590
<i>or some nutcase in there?</i>

728
01:05:05,701 --> 01:05:08,499
No. In fact,
I think he's a cop-

729
01:05:08,604 --> 01:05:11,437
Maybe not L.A.P.D.,
but he's a badge.

730
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:12,472
Why?

731
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:14,941
A hunch,
things he said,

732
01:05:15,044 --> 01:05:18,172
like being able
to spot a phony I.D.

733
01:05:18,281 --> 01:05:22,342
Jesus Christ, Powell. He could be
a fucking bartender for all we know!

734
01:05:22,451 --> 01:05:24,442
TV's here.

735
01:05:24,553 --> 01:05:26,521
Oh, shit.

736
01:05:43,172 --> 01:05:44,969
I have a request.

737
01:05:45,074 --> 01:05:47,907
What idiot
put you in charge?

738
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:49,477
You did...

739
01:05:49,578 --> 01:05:51,569
when you murdered
my boss.

740
01:05:51,681 --> 01:05:53,876
Now everybody's
looking to me.

741
01:05:53,983 --> 01:05:56,417
Personally,
I'd pass on the job.

742
01:05:56,519 --> 01:05:59,818
I don't enjoy being
this close to you.

743
01:06:07,530 --> 01:06:09,259
Go on.

744
01:06:09,365 --> 01:06:11,333
We have
a pregnant woman.

745
01:06:11,434 --> 01:06:14,301
Relax. She's not due
for a couple weeks,

746
01:06:14,403 --> 01:06:16,701
but sitting on that rock isn't
doing her back any good.

747
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:20,970
So, I would like permission to move her
to one of the offices where there's a sofa.

748
01:06:21,077 --> 01:06:25,013
I'll have a sofa
brought out. Good enough?

749
01:06:25,114 --> 01:06:26,775
Good enough.

750
01:06:26,882 --> 01:06:28,816
Unless you
like it messy,

751
01:06:28,918 --> 01:06:31,216
start bringing us
in groups to the bathroom.

752
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:34,346
Yes. You're right.

753
01:06:34,457 --> 01:06:37,085
<i>It will be done.</i>

754
01:06:37,193 --> 01:06:38,751
<i>Was there
something else?</i>

755
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:43,124
No, thank you.

756
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:52,065
Mr. Takagi chose
his people well, Mrs...

757
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:53,903
Gennero.

758
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:58,814
<i>Miss Gennero.</i>

759
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:03,617
<i>We interrupt this program
for a special bulletin.</i>

760
01:07:03,719 --> 01:07:06,916
This is Richard Thornburg
live from Century City.

761
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:09,423
Tonight, Los Angeles
has joined...

762
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:12,426
the sad and worldwide
fraternity of cities...

763
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:14,428
whose only
membership requirement...

764
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:17,931
<i>is to suffer the anguish
of international terrorism.</i>

765
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:19,934
<i>Approximately
two hours ago,</i>

766
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:21,936
<i>an unidentified
group of men...</i>

767
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:24,438
<i>seized control
of the Nakatomi Building,</i>

768
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:26,940
<i>sealing off
all entrances and exits.</i>

769
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:29,807
<i>All telephone lines
have been cut,</i>

770
01:07:29,912 --> 01:07:32,107
and the only communication
now possible...

771
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:35,274
<i>has been through the use
of CB communicators,</i>

772
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:37,614
<i>the group apparently
brought with them.</i>

773
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:39,711
<i>According to
official sources,</i>

774
01:07:39,822 --> 01:07:42,154
<i>the perpetrators
of this building siege...</i>

775
01:07:42,258 --> 01:07:45,022
Unit Five, hold your position.

776
01:07:45,127 --> 01:07:47,391
<i>We got Charlie Unit
in position...</i>

777
01:07:47,496 --> 01:07:49,123
<i>by the parking structure.</i>

778
01:07:49,231 --> 01:07:51,062
Let me ask you something.

779
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:54,068
Does this stairway
go up to the escalator?

780
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:55,398
Yeah.

781
01:07:55,504 --> 01:07:57,404
Tell them to go ahead.

782
01:07:57,506 --> 01:07:58,905
What's going on?

783
01:07:59,008 --> 01:08:01,909
What's it look like?
We're going in.

784
01:08:02,011 --> 01:08:04,070
Going in?
Man, that's crazy!

785
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:06,910
There could be
over 30 hostages!

786
01:08:07,016 --> 01:08:08,916
We don't know shit,
Powell.

787
01:08:09,018 --> 01:08:11,919
How come there were
no ransom demands?

788
01:08:12,021 --> 01:08:14,251
Where's their list
of demands?

789
01:08:14,356 --> 01:08:17,257
All we know is
somebody shot your car.

790
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:20,157
It's probably the same
son of a bitch...

791
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:22,093
<i>you've been
talking to on that radio.</i>

792
01:08:22,198 --> 01:08:23,927
Excuse me, sir.

793
01:08:24,033 --> 01:08:27,366
What about the body
that fell out the window?

794
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:29,938
Probably some stockbroker-
Got depressed.

795
01:08:30,039 --> 01:08:31,438
Let's go.

796
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:32,939
Hit your lights.

797
01:08:33,042 --> 01:08:34,441
<i>Let's go.</i>

798
01:08:34,543 --> 01:08:35,805
<i>Lights on!</i>

799
01:08:47,823 --> 01:08:49,723
Powell?

800
01:08:49,825 --> 01:08:52,851
You still with me, babe?
What's going on?

801
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:54,930
Yo, Al.

802
01:08:55,030 --> 01:08:58,761
I'm kind of busy.
I'll talk to you later.

803
01:08:58,868 --> 01:09:00,392
Al, what's wrong?

804
01:09:00,503 --> 01:09:01,595
We'll talk later.

805
01:09:01,704 --> 01:09:04,673
If you are what
I think you are,

806
01:09:04,773 --> 01:09:07,571
you'll know when
to listen, shut up,

807
01:09:07,676 --> 01:09:09,769
and when to pray.

808
01:09:09,879 --> 01:09:12,109
Jesus Christ!
You're coming in.

809
01:09:12,214 --> 01:09:15,650
<i>I told you what kind
of people they are.</i>

810
01:09:15,751 --> 01:09:17,912
<i>Let's load them up.
Blue go.</i>

811
01:09:20,523 --> 01:09:23,856
They'll be coming.
Everyone get ready.

812
01:09:23,959 --> 01:09:26,928
Theo, you are
the eyes now.

813
01:09:39,942 --> 01:09:43,036
Rivers, begin
your reconnoiter.

814
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:50,383
Shit!

815
01:10:09,905 --> 01:10:12,897
Hey, come on, man.
Let's go.

816
01:10:22,017 --> 01:10:23,712
Ow!Jesus!

817
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,888
All right, spread out.

818
01:11:26,248 --> 01:11:27,909
Shut up.

819
01:11:29,189 --> 01:11:30,884
Let's go.

820
01:11:35,395 --> 01:11:37,920
You macho assholes.
No! No!

821
01:11:41,001 --> 01:11:43,765
Ahem... all right.
Listen up, guys.

822
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:47,329
'Twas the night
before Christmas,

823
01:11:47,441 --> 01:11:49,807
and all through the house,

824
01:11:49,910 --> 01:11:51,935
not a creature
was stirring, except...

825
01:11:52,045 --> 01:11:54,980
the four assholes
coming in the rear...

826
01:11:55,082 --> 01:11:56,777
in standard
cover formation.

827
01:11:58,952 --> 01:12:00,544
We're all set.

828
01:12:00,654 --> 01:12:02,519
We're ready.

829
01:12:03,957 --> 01:12:05,515
Kick ass.

830
01:12:05,626 --> 01:12:06,558
Go.

831
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:08,560
Right.
Let's do it.

832
01:12:25,746 --> 01:12:27,646
They're shooting
at them.

833
01:12:27,748 --> 01:12:29,739
It's panic fire.
They can't see.

834
01:12:29,850 --> 01:12:31,613
They're shooting
at the lights.

835
01:12:35,689 --> 01:12:37,623
They're going
after the lights.

836
01:12:37,724 --> 01:12:39,521
<i>Pull them back.</i>

837
01:12:39,626 --> 01:12:41,526
It's not happening.

838
01:12:41,628 --> 01:12:43,095
Mike, burn it.

839
01:12:45,499 --> 01:12:47,126
Don't be impatient.

840
01:12:47,234 --> 01:12:49,964
Just wound them.

841
01:12:51,738 --> 01:12:53,706
They're sitting ducks
without lights.

842
01:12:53,807 --> 01:12:55,138
They're almost in.

843
01:12:55,242 --> 01:12:57,472
<i>Send in the car.</i>

844
01:12:57,578 --> 01:12:59,111
Send in the car.

845
01:13:12,492 --> 01:13:13,789
Jesus Christ!

846
01:13:17,064 --> 01:13:19,794
Rivers, Rodriguez,
report.

847
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:22,698
Whoa! Wait a minute.
What have we here, gentlemen?

848
01:13:26,873 --> 01:13:29,398
The police
have themselves an RV.

849
01:13:34,848 --> 01:13:36,008
Southeast corner.

850
01:13:48,028 --> 01:13:51,054
Oh,Jesus Christ.

851
01:14:01,608 --> 01:14:05,635
Get back!
Get the fuck back!

852
01:14:07,648 --> 01:14:08,637
Get over there!

853
01:14:08,749 --> 01:14:10,876
<i>Schnell! Schnell!</i>

854
01:14:10,984 --> 01:14:14,078
<i>Mach schnell!</i>

855
01:14:14,187 --> 01:14:16,553
<i>Weiter! Weiter!
Weiter!</i>

856
01:14:16,657 --> 01:14:18,716
<i>Mach schnell!
Mach schnell!</i>

857
01:14:18,825 --> 01:14:20,690
<i>Weiter!</i>

858
01:14:23,330 --> 01:14:25,594
<i>Mach los! Mach los!</i>

859
01:14:44,318 --> 01:14:45,751
I see him!

860
01:15:05,238 --> 01:15:08,139
Oh, my God!
The quarterback is toast!

861
01:15:08,241 --> 01:15:11,233
Hang on, Rivers.
That's an order.

862
01:15:11,345 --> 01:15:13,540
Hit it again.

863
01:15:13,647 --> 01:15:16,878
Hans, you motherfucker! You made
your point! Let them pull back!

864
01:15:16,983 --> 01:15:19,347
Thank you, Mr. Cowboy. I'll take
it under advisement. Hit it again!

865
01:15:19,382 --> 01:15:21,711
Thank you, Mr. Cowboy. I'll take
it under advisement. Hit it again!

866
01:15:34,468 --> 01:15:36,493
Fire.

867
01:15:51,218 --> 01:15:53,118
Fuck me.

868
01:15:53,220 --> 01:15:55,688
Get them out of the car.

869
01:15:57,124 --> 01:15:59,183
- Aah!
- Aah!

870
01:16:05,265 --> 01:16:06,562
Fuck it.

871
01:16:09,536 --> 01:16:11,265
<i>Mach schnell!
Mach los!</i>

872
01:16:18,145 --> 01:16:21,546
Let's see you take this
under advisement,jerkweed.

873
01:16:25,619 --> 01:16:28,247
Geronimo,
motherfucker.

874
01:16:47,107 --> 01:16:48,005
Shit!

875
01:16:53,013 --> 01:16:54,947
They're using
artillery on us!

876
01:16:55,048 --> 01:16:57,516
You idiot,
it's not the police.

877
01:16:57,617 --> 01:16:59,346
It's him.

878
01:17:06,626 --> 01:17:08,116
Holy shit.

879
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:15,192
My God.

880
01:17:16,636 --> 01:17:18,536
Tell me you got that.

881
01:17:18,638 --> 01:17:21,038
I got it.
I got it.

882
01:17:21,141 --> 01:17:24,008
Eat your heart out,
Channel Five.

883
01:17:24,110 --> 01:17:27,944
We've had an update on the
takeover of the Nakatomi Building-

884
01:17:28,048 --> 01:17:30,039
Sources say
the terrorist leader, " Hans,"

885
01:17:30,150 --> 01:17:32,550
may be this man-
Hans Gruber,

886
01:17:32,652 --> 01:17:35,553
<i>a member of the radical
West German Volksfrei movement.</i>

887
01:17:35,655 --> 01:17:37,555
<i>Strangely,
the Volksfrei leadership...</i>

888
01:17:37,657 --> 01:17:39,989
issued a communique
an hour ago...

889
01:17:40,093 --> 01:17:42,186
stating Gruber had been expelled
from that organization-

890
01:17:42,295 --> 01:17:44,092
Al? Al? Do you copy?

891
01:17:44,197 --> 01:17:46,165
Are you all right?

892
01:17:46,266 --> 01:17:47,756
Yeah, I'm fine.

893
01:17:49,636 --> 01:17:51,103
What was that?

894
01:17:51,204 --> 01:17:54,002
Remember that plastic
explosive I told you about?

895
01:17:54,107 --> 01:17:57,008
There you go.
Is the building on fire?

896
01:17:57,110 --> 01:17:59,943
No, but it's going to
need a paint job.

897
01:18:00,046 --> 01:18:02,947
Our spotter said
you got two that time.

898
01:18:03,049 --> 01:18:04,778
Is that him?

899
01:18:04,885 --> 01:18:06,284
Yes, sir.

900
01:18:06,386 --> 01:18:09,287
I don't know
who you think you are,

901
01:18:09,389 --> 01:18:12,881
but you just destroyed
a building.

902
01:18:12,993 --> 01:18:16,121
We do not want your help.
Is that clear?

903
01:18:16,229 --> 01:18:18,629
I've got 100 people
down here,

904
01:18:18,732 --> 01:18:20,632
and they're covered
with glass.

905
01:18:20,734 --> 01:18:22,964
Who gives a shit
about glass?

906
01:18:23,069 --> 01:18:25,060
Who the fuck is this?

907
01:18:25,171 --> 01:18:28,140
This is deputy chief of police,
Dwayne T. Robinson,

908
01:18:28,241 --> 01:18:31,540
and I am in charge
of this situation.

909
01:18:31,645 --> 01:18:33,135
Oh, you're in charge?

910
01:18:33,246 --> 01:18:35,476
I got bad news
for you, Dwayne.

911
01:18:35,582 --> 01:18:38,813
It doesn't look like you're
in charge of jack shit.

912
01:18:38,919 --> 01:18:41,888
- Listen to me, you little asshole-
- Asshole?

913
01:18:41,988 --> 01:18:46,618
I'm not the one who just got
buttfucked on national TV, Dwayne!

914
01:18:46,726 --> 01:18:48,887
<i>Listen to me,jerkoff,</i>

915
01:18:48,995 --> 01:18:51,964
quit being part
of the fucking problem...

916
01:18:52,065 --> 01:18:54,966
and put the other guy
back on!

917
01:18:57,571 --> 01:18:59,766
Hey, Roy, how are
you feeling?

918
01:18:59,873 --> 01:19:01,636
Pretty fucking
unappreciated, Al.

919
01:19:01,741 --> 01:19:03,470
Hey, look.
I love you.

920
01:19:03,577 --> 01:19:06,512
So do a lot
of the other guys.

921
01:19:06,613 --> 01:19:08,979
You hang in there.
You hear me?

922
01:19:09,082 --> 01:19:11,141
You hang in there.

923
01:19:12,586 --> 01:19:15,612
Yeah, thanks, partner.

924
01:19:20,093 --> 01:19:21,993
What are you doing?

925
01:19:22,095 --> 01:19:24,495
I'm tired
of waiting to see...

926
01:19:24,598 --> 01:19:27,829
who gets us killed first-
them or your husband.

927
01:19:27,934 --> 01:19:29,629
What are you
going to do?

928
01:19:29,736 --> 01:19:33,001
Hey, babe, I negotiate
million-dollar deals for breakfast.

929
01:19:33,106 --> 01:19:35,597
I think I can
handle this " Euro-trash. "

930
01:19:35,709 --> 01:19:38,177
<i>Hey,
sprechen sie, talk?</i>

931
01:19:38,278 --> 01:19:41,008
If you'd listened to me,
he'd be neutralized.

932
01:19:41,114 --> 01:19:44,015
<i>I don't want neutral. I want dead.</i>

933
01:19:44,117 --> 01:19:46,278
Hope I'm not
interrupting.

934
01:19:46,386 --> 01:19:47,410
What does he want?

935
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:49,181
It's not
what I want.

936
01:19:49,289 --> 01:19:51,689
It's what
I can give you.

937
01:19:58,632 --> 01:20:00,930
<i>Oy, let's be
straight, okay?</i>

938
01:20:01,034 --> 01:20:03,025
It's obvious you're not
some dumb schmuck up here...

939
01:20:03,136 --> 01:20:05,696
to snatch a few purses,
am I right?

940
01:20:05,805 --> 01:20:07,363
Very perceptive.

941
01:20:07,474 --> 01:20:09,032
<i>I watch
60 Minutes.</i>

942
01:20:09,142 --> 01:20:11,872
I say to myself,
"these guys are professional,

943
01:20:11,978 --> 01:20:13,878
"they're motivated,
they're happening,

944
01:20:13,980 --> 01:20:16,073
i. e., they want
something," huh?

945
01:20:16,182 --> 01:20:18,980
<i>I couldn't care less
about your politics.</i>

946
01:20:19,085 --> 01:20:21,212
Maybe you're pissed off
at the camel jockeys,

947
01:20:21,321 --> 01:20:22,879
maybe it's the Hebes,
Northern Ireland-

948
01:20:22,989 --> 01:20:24,047
It's none
of my business.

949
01:20:24,157 --> 01:20:26,751
I figure you're here to negotiate.
Am I right?

950
01:20:26,860 --> 01:20:28,259
You're amazing.

951
01:20:28,361 --> 01:20:30,352
You figured this
all out already?

952
01:20:30,463 --> 01:20:32,226
Hey, business
is business.

953
01:20:32,332 --> 01:20:35,233
You use a gun. I use a fountain
pen. What's the difference?

954
01:20:35,335 --> 01:20:37,565
Let's put it
in my terms.

955
01:20:37,671 --> 01:20:39,798
You're here on a hostile takeover.
You grab us for some greenmail,

956
01:20:39,906 --> 01:20:43,205
<i>but you didn't expect
some poison pill running around.</i>

957
01:20:43,309 --> 01:20:46,005
Am I right?

958
01:20:46,112 --> 01:20:49,673
Hans, bubby, I'm
your white knight.

959
01:20:49,783 --> 01:20:52,343
<i>I must have missed
60 Minutes.</i>

960
01:20:52,452 --> 01:20:54,545
What are you saying?

961
01:20:56,623 --> 01:20:59,683
The guy upstairs is
fucking things up, huh?

962
01:21:04,130 --> 01:21:06,530
I can give him to you.

963
01:21:09,269 --> 01:21:11,328
<i>Oh, God...</i>

964
01:21:11,438 --> 01:21:12,530
Uhh...

965
01:21:12,639 --> 01:21:13,537
Roy?

966
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:15,801
Roy,
you all right?

967
01:21:15,909 --> 01:21:19,538
Just trying to fire down
a 1,000-year-old Twinkie.

968
01:21:19,646 --> 01:21:22,615
What do they put
in these things anyway?

969
01:21:22,716 --> 01:21:25,276
Sugar, enriched flour,

970
01:21:25,385 --> 01:21:27,285
partially hydrogenated
vegetable oil,

971
01:21:27,387 --> 01:21:29,548
polysorbate 60...

972
01:21:29,656 --> 01:21:31,783
and yellow dye
number five-

973
01:21:31,891 --> 01:21:34,291
Just everything
a growing boy needs.

974
01:21:34,394 --> 01:21:36,794
How many kids
you got, Al?

975
01:21:36,896 --> 01:21:40,957
My wife is working
on our first.

976
01:21:41,067 --> 01:21:43,126
How about you,
cowboy?

977
01:21:43,236 --> 01:21:45,101
You got any kids?

978
01:21:46,406 --> 01:21:49,671
Yeah... two.

979
01:21:49,776 --> 01:21:53,872
Hope I can see 'em swingin' on
a jungle gym with AIJr. someday.

980
01:21:55,915 --> 01:21:57,815
Well, now,
that's a date,

981
01:21:57,917 --> 01:22:00,818
but you bring
the ice cream.

982
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:02,820
<i>Touching, cowboy. Touching.</i>

983
01:22:02,922 --> 01:22:05,254
<i>Or should I call you...</i>

984
01:22:05,358 --> 01:22:08,156
Mr. McClane.?

985
01:22:08,261 --> 01:22:11,492
Mr. OfficerJohn McClane...

986
01:22:11,598 --> 01:22:15,193
<i>of the New York
Police Department?</i>

987
01:22:15,301 --> 01:22:18,134
- Get on the phone to Harry in New York. Come on, baby. Move.!
- Got it.

988
01:22:18,238 --> 01:22:20,468
Better get a hold
of somebody at dispatch.

989
01:22:20,573 --> 01:22:24,339
Sister Theresa called me
Mr. McClane in the third grade,

990
01:22:24,444 --> 01:22:26,344
my friends call meJohn,

991
01:22:26,446 --> 01:22:29,472
and you're neither,
shithead.

992
01:22:29,582 --> 01:22:33,348
I have someone
who wants to talk to you-

993
01:22:33,453 --> 01:22:36,081
A very special friend...

994
01:22:36,189 --> 01:22:38,680
<i>who was with you
at the party tonight.</i>

995
01:22:44,397 --> 01:22:46,797
Hey,John boy.

996
01:22:48,067 --> 01:22:49,125
Ellis?

997
01:22:49,235 --> 01:22:51,135
Yeah.
Now, listen,John.

998
01:22:51,237 --> 01:22:53,205
They're giving me
a few minutes...

999
01:22:53,306 --> 01:22:55,240
to try to talk
some sense into you.

1000
01:22:55,341 --> 01:22:58,333
I know you think
you're doin' your job,

1001
01:22:58,444 --> 01:23:01,208
but you're just
draggin' this thing out.

1002
01:23:01,314 --> 01:23:04,715
<i>No one gets out of here
until these guys can talk...</i>

1003
01:23:04,818 --> 01:23:06,217
to the L.A. police, and that
just ain't gonna happen...

1004
01:23:06,319 --> 01:23:08,480
<i>till you stop messing up
the works, capisci?</i>

1005
01:23:13,326 --> 01:23:15,817
Ellis, what have
you told them?

1006
01:23:15,929 --> 01:23:19,922
I told them
we were old friends,

1007
01:23:20,033 --> 01:23:22,228
and you were
my guest.

1008
01:23:22,335 --> 01:23:24,530
You shouldn't
be doing this.

1009
01:23:24,637 --> 01:23:26,298
Tell me about it.

1010
01:23:32,245 --> 01:23:34,213
All right,John,
listen.

1011
01:23:34,314 --> 01:23:37,306
They want you to tell them
where the detonators are.

1012
01:23:37,417 --> 01:23:39,749
They know people
are listening.

1013
01:23:39,853 --> 01:23:41,582
They want
the detonators,

1014
01:23:41,688 --> 01:23:43,849
or they're
going to kill me.

1015
01:23:46,259 --> 01:23:48,819
John, didn't you
hear me?

1016
01:23:51,030 --> 01:23:53,191
Yeah, I hear you.

1017
01:23:53,299 --> 01:23:54,926
John, get
with the program.

1018
01:23:55,034 --> 01:23:56,433
Tell these guys...

1019
01:23:56,536 --> 01:23:57,935
where
the detonators are...

1020
01:23:58,037 --> 01:24:00,096
so no one else
gets hurt!

1021
01:24:00,206 --> 01:24:03,107
I'm putting my life
on the line, pal!

1022
01:24:03,209 --> 01:24:04,938
Ellis,
listen to me carefully.

1023
01:24:05,044 --> 01:24:06,306
John-

1024
01:24:06,412 --> 01:24:08,277
Shut up, Ellis!
Just shut your mouth!

1025
01:24:08,381 --> 01:24:10,576
Put Hans back on!

1026
01:24:10,683 --> 01:24:14,779
Hans, this shithead doesn't
know you, but I do-

1027
01:24:14,888 --> 01:24:17,789
Good. Then you'll
give us what we want.

1028
01:24:17,891 --> 01:24:20,291
You're not part
of this equation.

1029
01:24:20,393 --> 01:24:23,419
What am I,
a method actor?

1030
01:24:23,529 --> 01:24:24,928
Put away the gun.

1031
01:24:25,031 --> 01:24:26,794
This is radio,
not television.

1032
01:24:26,900 --> 01:24:30,301
Hans, he's not my friend!
I don't know him!

1033
01:24:30,403 --> 01:24:32,303
Jesus, Ellis!
They'll kill you!

1034
01:24:32,405 --> 01:24:34,635
Tell them
you don't know me!

1035
01:24:34,741 --> 01:24:38,199
How can you say that
after all these years?

1036
01:24:38,311 --> 01:24:42,247
John? John?

1037
01:25:04,337 --> 01:25:06,100
Do you hear that?

1038
01:25:06,205 --> 01:25:09,265
Talk to me! Where
are my detonators?

1039
01:25:09,375 --> 01:25:10,774
Where are they,

1040
01:25:10,877 --> 01:25:12,868
or shall I shoot
another one?

1041
01:25:12,979 --> 01:25:14,378
Sooner or later,

1042
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:16,778
I'll get to someone
you care about.

1043
01:25:16,883 --> 01:25:19,113
Go fuck
yourself, Hans.

1044
01:25:21,354 --> 01:25:23,015
Did you hear that?

1045
01:25:23,122 --> 01:25:26,285
He just let
the guy die, man.

1046
01:25:26,392 --> 01:25:28,792
Man, can't you see
what's happening?

1047
01:25:28,895 --> 01:25:31,295
Can't you read
between the lines?

1048
01:25:31,397 --> 01:25:32,796
He did everything
he could...

1049
01:25:32,899 --> 01:25:34,298
to save him.

1050
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:37,301
If he gave up,
they'd both be dead!

1051
01:25:37,403 --> 01:25:39,735
No. They'd be
talking to us.

1052
01:25:39,839 --> 01:25:43,240
You tell your partner
to stay out of this.

1053
01:25:43,343 --> 01:25:44,742
If he doesn't,

1054
01:25:44,844 --> 01:25:46,243
I'm going to
nail his ass.

1055
01:25:46,346 --> 01:25:48,246
The man is hurting.

1056
01:25:48,348 --> 01:25:50,248
He is alone, tired,

1057
01:25:50,350 --> 01:25:52,443
and he hasn't seen
diddly-squat...

1058
01:25:52,552 --> 01:25:53,951
from anybody here!

1059
01:25:54,053 --> 01:25:56,749
You think
he'll give a damn...

1060
01:25:56,856 --> 01:25:59,791
<i>about what you do
if he makes it?</i>

1061
01:25:59,892 --> 01:26:02,588
Wake up and smell
what you shoveling.

1062
01:26:02,695 --> 01:26:05,596
Anytime you want
to go home,

1063
01:26:05,698 --> 01:26:08,064
you consider
yourself dismissed.

1064
01:26:08,167 --> 01:26:10,761
No, sir.
You couldn't drag me away.

1065
01:26:10,870 --> 01:26:11,436
<i>Attention, police.</i>

1066
01:26:11,471 --> 01:26:12,768
<i>Attention, police.</i>

1067
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:16,634
Attention, police.

1068
01:26:16,743 --> 01:26:18,938
This is Sergeant
Al Powell-

1069
01:26:19,045 --> 01:26:21,445
This is deputy chief
Dwayne Robinson.

1070
01:26:21,547 --> 01:26:23,481
Who is this?

1071
01:26:23,583 --> 01:26:25,107
This is Hans Gruber.

1072
01:26:25,218 --> 01:26:28,449
I assume you realize
the futility of direct action.

1073
01:26:28,554 --> 01:26:31,887
We have no wish
for further loss of life.

1074
01:26:31,991 --> 01:26:34,983
Well, what is it
you do wish for?

1075
01:26:35,094 --> 01:26:37,289
I have comrades
around the world...

1076
01:26:37,397 --> 01:26:39,126
languishing
in prison.

1077
01:26:39,232 --> 01:26:41,063
The American
State Department...

1078
01:26:41,167 --> 01:26:43,567
enjoys rattling its saber
for itself.

1079
01:26:43,669 --> 01:26:46,570
Now it can rattle it
for me.

1080
01:26:46,672 --> 01:26:50,233
The following are to be
released from their captors-

1081
01:26:50,343 --> 01:26:54,040
The seven members
of the New Provo Front,

1082
01:26:54,147 --> 01:26:58,709
<i>in Canada, the five imprisoned
leaders of Libert?du Quebec,</i>

1083
01:26:58,818 --> 01:27:02,254
in Sri Lanka, the nine members
of the Asian Dawn.

1084
01:27:02,355 --> 01:27:04,289
What the fuck?

1085
01:27:06,392 --> 01:27:09,088
<i>I read about them
in Time magazine.</i>

1086
01:27:09,195 --> 01:27:12,596
When these revolutionary
brothers and sisters are free,

1087
01:27:12,698 --> 01:27:15,599
the hostages will be
taken to the roof...

1088
01:27:15,701 --> 01:27:18,101
and will accompany us
in helicopters...

1089
01:27:18,204 --> 01:27:20,604
to the Los Angeles
International Airport...

1090
01:27:20,706 --> 01:27:22,936
where they'll be given
further instructions.

1091
01:27:23,042 --> 01:27:25,602
You have two hours
to comply.

1092
01:27:25,711 --> 01:27:27,440
Wait a minute,
Mr. Gruber.

1093
01:27:27,547 --> 01:27:28,946
This is crazy.

1094
01:27:29,048 --> 01:27:30,447
I don't have
the authority.

1095
01:27:30,550 --> 01:27:32,950
Two hours
is not enough.

1096
01:27:33,052 --> 01:27:36,283
Hello? Hello!

1097
01:27:36,389 --> 01:27:38,289
Did you get
all that?

1098
01:27:38,391 --> 01:27:40,586
We got to make
some calls.

1099
01:27:40,693 --> 01:27:42,854
Do you think
they'll try?

1100
01:27:42,962 --> 01:27:44,395
Who cares?

1101
01:27:47,333 --> 01:27:49,528
Theo, are we
on schedule?

1102
01:27:49,635 --> 01:27:52,331
One more. Then
it's up to you.

1103
01:27:52,438 --> 01:27:55,032
This one will
take a miracle.

1104
01:27:55,141 --> 01:27:56,540
It's Christmas, Theo.

1105
01:27:56,642 --> 01:27:59,839
It's the time of miracles,
so be of good cheer.

1106
01:27:59,946 --> 01:28:02,847
Call me when you hit
the last lock.

1107
01:28:02,949 --> 01:28:07,682
Hunt that little shit down
and get those detonators.

1108
01:28:07,787 --> 01:28:10,881
Fritz is checking
the explosives.

1109
01:28:10,990 --> 01:28:12,651
I'll check
the explosives.

1110
01:28:12,758 --> 01:28:15,090
Hey, Powell,
you out there?

1111
01:28:15,194 --> 01:28:18,322
I'm here,John.
I'm here.

1112
01:28:18,431 --> 01:28:21,867
Believe me, there was
nothing I could do.

1113
01:28:21,968 --> 01:28:24,368
It's gonna be
both our asses...

1114
01:28:24,470 --> 01:28:25,994
if you're wrong.

1115
01:28:26,105 --> 01:28:27,766
I hear you.

1116
01:28:32,879 --> 01:28:35,905
Did you catch that bullshit
Hans was running?

1117
01:28:36,015 --> 01:28:38,279
It doesn't
make sense, man.

1118
01:28:38,384 --> 01:28:40,409
I'm just
a desk jockey...

1119
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:43,921
who was on my way
home when you rang.

1120
01:28:44,023 --> 01:28:45,422
The way you drove,

1121
01:28:45,525 --> 01:28:47,891
I figured you
for the street.

1122
01:28:47,994 --> 01:28:50,656
In my youth.
In my youth.

the early stages

1133
01:29:15,354 --> 01:29:17,686
and a projection
of dependency.

1134
01:29:17,790 --> 01:29:20,418
<i>A strange sort of trust
and bond develops.</i>

1135
01:29:20,526 --> 01:29:22,926
<i>We've had situations
where the hostages...</i>

1136
01:29:23,029 --> 01:29:24,929
<i>embraced their captors
after release...</i>

1137
01:29:25,031 --> 01:29:28,125
<i>and even corresponded
with them in prison.</i>

1138
01:29:28,234 --> 01:29:31,260
No, no, darling.
Asian Dawn. Dawn.

1139
01:29:31,370 --> 01:29:33,600
D- A-W-N.

1140
01:29:33,706 --> 01:29:34,764
Sir?

1141
01:29:34,874 --> 01:29:35,772
Yeah?

1142
01:29:35,875 --> 01:29:37,775
The FBI is here.

1143
01:29:37,877 --> 01:29:39,708
The FBI is here now?

1144
01:29:39,812 --> 01:29:41,939
Yes, sir.
Right over there.

1145
01:29:42,048 --> 01:29:42,810
Hold this.

1146
01:29:42,915 --> 01:29:45,213
Want a breath mint?

1147
01:29:48,821 --> 01:29:51,221
Hey, how you
doing, man?

1148
01:29:51,324 --> 01:29:52,723
I'm AgentJohnson.

1149
01:29:52,825 --> 01:29:54,224
This is Special AgentJohnson.

1150
01:29:54,327 --> 01:29:56,227
Oh, how you doing?

1151
01:29:56,329 --> 01:29:57,887
No relation.

1152
01:29:57,997 --> 01:29:59,225
I'm, uh...

1153
01:29:59,332 --> 01:30:01,232
I'm Dwayne Robinson,
L.A.P.D.

1154
01:30:01,334 --> 01:30:04,235
I'm in charge here.

1155
01:30:04,337 --> 01:30:05,895
Not anymore.

1156
01:31:00,860 --> 01:31:04,921
Hi there.
How you doing?

1157
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:10,100
Ooh...

1158
01:31:10,202 --> 01:31:13,433
Please, God. You're
one of them, aren't you?

1159
01:31:13,539 --> 01:31:15,598
You're one of them.

1160
01:31:15,708 --> 01:31:18,768
No! Don't kill me!
No, please.

1161
01:31:18,878 --> 01:31:21,608
Don't kill me,
please! No!

1162
01:31:21,714 --> 01:31:24,148
Relax. I'm not
going to hurt you.

1163
01:31:24,250 --> 01:31:25,717
I won't hurt you!

1164
01:31:28,721 --> 01:31:30,621
Oh, God.

1165
01:31:32,224 --> 01:31:35,057
What the fuck are
you doing up here?

1166
01:31:35,161 --> 01:31:37,129
What were you
looking for?

1167
01:31:37,229 --> 01:31:40,130
I managed to get
out of there.

1168
01:31:40,232 --> 01:31:43,633
I was trying to get
up on the roof...

1169
01:31:43,736 --> 01:31:46,637
and see if I could
signal for help.

1170
01:31:46,739 --> 01:31:48,866
Why don't you
come and help?

1171
01:31:48,974 --> 01:31:52,137
Hold it. Hold it.
Forget the roof.

1172
01:31:52,244 --> 01:31:53,643
Forget the roof.

1173
01:31:53,746 --> 01:31:56,146
They got people
all over it.

1174
01:31:56,248 --> 01:31:59,376
You want to stay alive,
you stay with me.

1175
01:32:02,288 --> 01:32:04,779
The best
we can figure it,

1176
01:32:04,890 --> 01:32:07,791
we've got maybe 30 or 35
hostages up there,

1177
01:32:07,893 --> 01:32:09,793
probably
on the 30th floor,

1178
01:32:09,895 --> 01:32:13,661
and maybe seven or eight
terrorists up there.

1179
01:32:13,766 --> 01:32:15,825
Sounds like
an A-7 scenario.

1180
01:32:15,935 --> 01:32:17,664
We'll handle it
from here.

1181
01:32:17,770 --> 01:32:19,169
When we
commandeer your men,

1182
01:32:19,271 --> 01:32:20,704
we'll let you know.

1183
01:32:20,806 --> 01:32:22,205
Aren't you...

1184
01:32:22,308 --> 01:32:23,673
forgetting something?

1185
01:32:23,776 --> 01:32:24,674
Such as?

1186
01:32:24,777 --> 01:32:26,210
What about
John McClane?

1187
01:32:26,312 --> 01:32:27,711
He's the reason...

1188
01:32:27,813 --> 01:32:29,405
we have
any information.

1189
01:32:29,515 --> 01:32:31,278
He's also the reason...

1190
01:32:31,384 --> 01:32:33,113
you're only facing
seven terrorists.

1191
01:32:33,219 --> 01:32:35,585
He's inside?
Who is he?

1192
01:32:35,688 --> 01:32:38,589
He might be a cop.
We're checking.

1193
01:32:38,691 --> 01:32:40,022
One of yours?

1194
01:32:40,126 --> 01:32:41,184
No way.

1195
01:32:46,065 --> 01:32:47,692
You smoke?

1196
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:50,633
Yeah.

1197
01:32:55,241 --> 01:32:56,299
Thanks.

1198
01:33:00,746 --> 01:33:03,408
You don't work
for Nakatomi.

1199
01:33:06,252 --> 01:33:09,449
And if you're not
one of them-

1200
01:33:11,624 --> 01:33:14,115
I'm a cop
from New York.

1201
01:33:15,761 --> 01:33:17,661
New York?

1202
01:33:17,763 --> 01:33:21,995
Yeah. Got invited to
the Christmas party by mistake.

1203
01:33:22,101 --> 01:33:23,898
Who knew?

1204
01:33:29,875 --> 01:33:33,971
<i>Well, it's better than being caught
with your pants down, huh?</i>

1205
01:33:44,123 --> 01:33:45,385
I'm John McClane.

1206
01:33:46,725 --> 01:33:49,626
<i>You're, uh...</i>

1207
01:33:49,728 --> 01:33:50,786
Clay.

1208
01:33:52,731 --> 01:33:54,426
Bill Clay.

1209
01:33:59,738 --> 01:34:02,730
Know how to use
a handgun, Bill?

1210
01:34:02,842 --> 01:34:05,811
I spent a weekend
at a combat ranch-

1211
01:34:05,911 --> 01:34:08,539
The guns that shoot
red paint.

1212
01:34:08,647 --> 01:34:12,640
Probably seems
kind of stupid to you.

1213
01:34:12,751 --> 01:34:13,843
Nope.

1214
01:34:15,754 --> 01:34:18,245
Time for the real
thing, Bill.

1215
01:34:26,932 --> 01:34:30,368
All you got to do
is pull the trigger.

1216
01:34:49,722 --> 01:34:51,622
Put down the gun...

1217
01:34:51,724 --> 01:34:54,090
and give me
my detonators.

1218
01:34:58,697 --> 01:35:01,564
Well, well, well...

1219
01:35:01,667 --> 01:35:02,998
Hans.

1220
01:35:03,102 --> 01:35:06,538
Put it down now.

1221
01:35:10,175 --> 01:35:13,076
That's pretty tricky
with that accent.

1222
01:35:13,178 --> 01:35:16,204
You ought to be
on fucking TV.

1223
01:35:18,684 --> 01:35:22,950
What do you want
with the detonators, Hans?

1224
01:35:23,055 --> 01:35:26,024
I already used
all the explosives...

1225
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:29,357
or did I?

1226
01:35:29,461 --> 01:35:32,055
I'm going to
count to three.

1227
01:35:32,164 --> 01:35:33,096
Yeah.

1228
01:35:33,198 --> 01:35:34,825
Like you did
with Takagi?

1229
01:35:35,935 --> 01:35:36,833
Oops.

1230
01:35:38,737 --> 01:35:40,227
No bullets.

1231
01:35:40,339 --> 01:35:43,172
- What do you think-
I'm fucking stupid, Hans?

1232
01:35:43,275 --> 01:35:44,242
You we're saying?

1233
01:36:38,530 --> 01:36:39,428
Karl.

1234
01:36:48,440 --> 01:36:51,068
Shoot the glass!

1235
01:37:24,209 --> 01:37:26,541
Jesus Christ!

1236
01:37:55,074 --> 01:37:58,134
Smile, Karl.
We're back in business.

1237
01:38:00,946 --> 01:38:03,244
<i>...is the last resort
of diplomacy,</i>

1238
01:38:03,348 --> 01:38:05,578
<i>couldn't we
just as well say...</i>

1239
01:38:05,684 --> 01:38:08,016
<i>that terrorism
has an equal claim...</i>

1240
01:38:08,120 --> 01:38:10,054
<i>on being that, too?</i>

1241
01:38:10,155 --> 01:38:12,919
You got something.
Tell me you got something.

1242
01:38:13,025 --> 01:38:15,755
Just McClane's name,
badge number, employment record,

1243
01:38:15,861 --> 01:38:18,455
vital statistics,
and his family's home address,

1244
01:38:18,564 --> 01:38:20,964
right here in L.A.

1245
01:38:21,066 --> 01:38:23,591
Woo!

1246
01:38:28,841 --> 01:38:30,604
Go to work.

1247
01:38:30,709 --> 01:38:32,108
You got it.

1248
01:38:44,056 --> 01:38:45,956
God!
That man looks...

1249
01:38:46,058 --> 01:38:47,616
really pissed.

1250
01:38:49,228 --> 01:38:51,628
He's still alive.

1251
01:38:51,730 --> 01:38:53,630
What?

1252
01:38:53,732 --> 01:38:57,793
OnlyJohn can drive
somebody that crazy.

1253
01:39:13,752 --> 01:39:16,346
Hans, you better
heat up that miracle.

1254
01:39:16,455 --> 01:39:19,015
We broke through
on number six.

1255
01:39:19,124 --> 01:39:21,786
The electromagnetic
came down like a fucking anvil.

1256
01:39:21,894 --> 01:39:25,091
See what our friends
outside are doing,

1257
01:39:25,197 --> 01:39:27,131
and I'll be right up.

1258
01:39:28,634 --> 01:39:30,534
Hey,John.
John McClane,

1259
01:39:30,636 --> 01:39:32,536
you still with us?

1260
01:39:32,638 --> 01:39:34,037
Yeah.

1261
01:39:34,139 --> 01:39:35,538
All things being equal,

1262
01:39:35,641 --> 01:39:38,041
I'd rather be
in Philadelphia.

1263
01:39:38,143 --> 01:39:40,976
Chalk up
two more bad guys.

1264
01:39:41,079 --> 01:39:42,979
Well, the boys
down here...

1265
01:39:43,081 --> 01:39:45,481
will be glad
to hear that.

1266
01:39:45,584 --> 01:39:48,485
We got a pool
going on you.

1267
01:39:48,587 --> 01:39:50,487
What kind of odds
am I getting?

1268
01:39:50,589 --> 01:39:52,989
<i>- You don't want to know.
- Put me down for 20.</i>

1269
01:39:53,091 --> 01:39:55,457
I'm good for it.

1270
01:39:57,095 --> 01:40:00,428
<i>Hey, pal,you got flat feet?</i>

1271
01:40:02,434 --> 01:40:05,528
What the hell are
you talking about?

1272
01:40:05,637 --> 01:40:08,538
Something had to
get you off the street.

1273
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:10,540
You don't think
jockeying papers...

1274
01:40:10,642 --> 01:40:12,576
is a noble effort?

1275
01:40:14,379 --> 01:40:15,778
<i>No.</i>

1276
01:40:18,884 --> 01:40:20,784
I had an accident.

1277
01:40:20,886 --> 01:40:24,583
<i>The way you drive,
I can see why.</i>

1278
01:40:24,690 --> 01:40:27,124
You run over
your captain's foot?

1279
01:40:30,395 --> 01:40:32,329
I shot a kid.

1280
01:40:32,431 --> 01:40:34,831
<i>He was 13 years old.</i>

1281
01:40:34,933 --> 01:40:37,834
Oh, it was dark.
I couldn't see him.

1282
01:40:37,936 --> 01:40:40,905
<i>Oh, it was dark. He had a ray
gun that looked real enough.</i>

1283
01:40:44,409 --> 01:40:46,274
When you're a rookie,
they can teach you...

1284
01:40:46,378 --> 01:40:47,777
everything
about being a cop,

1285
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:49,848
except how to live
with a mistake.

1286
01:40:53,385 --> 01:40:55,785
<i>Anyway, I just
couldn't bring myself...</i>

1287
01:40:55,888 --> 01:40:59,517
<i>to draw my gun
on anybody again.</i>

1288
01:41:01,393 --> 01:41:03,293
<i>Sorry, man.</i>

1289
01:41:03,395 --> 01:41:07,297
Hey, man,
how could you know?

1290
01:41:09,401 --> 01:41:12,564
I feel like shit
anyway.

1291
01:41:12,671 --> 01:41:16,198
Well, then,
this won't matter.

1292
01:41:16,308 --> 01:41:18,333
<i>The L.A.P.D. is not...</i>

1293
01:41:18,443 --> 01:41:20,877
<i>calling the shots
down here anymore.</i>

1294
01:41:22,915 --> 01:41:24,610
The feds?

1295
01:41:24,716 --> 01:41:26,115
You got it.

1296
01:41:27,753 --> 01:41:31,814
All right.
Those are the city engineers.

1297
01:41:31,924 --> 01:41:34,825
They're going into
the street circuits.

1298
01:41:34,927 --> 01:41:37,327
<i>Those guys in the suits,
I don't know who they are.</i>

1299
01:41:37,429 --> 01:41:38,896
<i>That's the FBI.</i>

1300
01:41:38,997 --> 01:41:40,828
They're ordering
the others...

1301
01:41:40,933 --> 01:41:42,833
to cut
the building's power.

1302
01:41:42,935 --> 01:41:45,403
Regular
as clockwork.

1303
01:41:46,939 --> 01:41:48,839
Or a time lock.

1304
01:41:48,941 --> 01:41:51,205
<i>Precisely.</i>

1305
01:41:51,310 --> 01:41:53,676
The circuits
that cannot be cut...

1306
01:41:53,779 --> 01:41:55,178
are cut automatically...

1307
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:57,680
in response to
a terrorist incident.

1308
01:41:57,783 --> 01:41:59,683
You asked for miracles.

1309
01:41:59,785 --> 01:42:02,811
I give you the FBI.

1310
01:43:24,507 --> 01:43:25,565
It's going to go!

1311
01:43:27,210 --> 01:43:28,768
Yes!

1312
01:43:51,334 --> 01:43:52,733
Merry Christmas.

1313
01:43:54,637 --> 01:43:57,401
Those bastards are probably
pissing in their pants.

1314
01:43:57,506 --> 01:43:59,667
The mayor will
have my ass.

1315
01:44:06,349 --> 01:44:07,748
Woo!

1316
01:44:21,130 --> 01:44:23,325
What will we do now?

1317
01:44:23,432 --> 01:44:26,265
Arrest them for not paying
their electric bill?

1318
01:44:26,369 --> 01:44:28,269
We've shut them down.

1319
01:44:28,371 --> 01:44:29,770
We let them sweat,

1320
01:44:29,872 --> 01:44:31,806
then give them
helicopters.

1321
01:44:31,908 --> 01:44:33,773
Right up the ass.

1322
01:44:35,878 --> 01:44:39,712
This is AgentJohnson.
No, the other one.

1323
01:44:39,815 --> 01:44:42,716
I want air support
ready in five minutes.

1324
01:44:42,818 --> 01:44:44,581
Damn right.
Fully armed.

1325
01:44:44,687 --> 01:44:46,552
<i>We're on the way.</i>

1326
01:44:53,329 --> 01:44:54,421
Yeah!

1327
01:44:54,530 --> 01:44:58,432
I wish to talk to the FBI.

1328
01:45:00,836 --> 01:45:03,304
This is
Special AgentJohnson.

1329
01:45:03,406 --> 01:45:05,306
The State Department
has arranged...

1330
01:45:05,408 --> 01:45:07,842
for the return
of your comrades.

1331
01:45:07,944 --> 01:45:10,742
Helicopters are en route
as you requested.

1332
01:45:10,846 --> 01:45:12,245
We'll be ready.

1333
01:45:12,348 --> 01:45:13,747
When he realizes
what hit him,

1334
01:45:13,849 --> 01:45:15,373
he'll be dead.

1335
01:45:15,484 --> 01:45:18,385
When they touch down,
we'll blow the roof.

1336
01:45:18,487 --> 01:45:20,387
By the time
they figure out...

1337
01:45:20,489 --> 01:45:21,888
what went wrong,

1338
01:45:21,991 --> 01:45:23,925
we'll be sitting
on a beach...

1339
01:45:24,026 --> 01:45:25,288
earning 20%.

1340
01:45:29,865 --> 01:45:31,765
Ah!Jeez!

1341
01:45:31,867 --> 01:45:35,496
Powell?
Yo, Powell, you got a minute?

1342
01:45:37,206 --> 01:45:38,935
I'm here,John.

1343
01:45:40,643 --> 01:45:44,044
I'm starting to get
a bad feeling up here.

1344
01:45:44,146 --> 01:45:47,047
I want you to do
something for me.

1345
01:45:47,149 --> 01:45:48,707
Um...

1346
01:45:48,818 --> 01:45:51,719
I want you
to find my wife.

1347
01:45:51,821 --> 01:45:53,721
Don't ask me how.

1348
01:45:53,823 --> 01:45:56,724
I want you
to tell her something.

1349
01:45:56,826 --> 01:45:59,727
I want you
to tell her that...

1350
01:45:59,829 --> 01:46:01,228
Um...

1351
01:46:02,832 --> 01:46:04,231
Mmm...

1352
01:46:06,335 --> 01:46:10,237
Tell her it took me
a while to figure out...

1353
01:46:10,339 --> 01:46:12,239
what a jerk I'd been,

1354
01:46:12,341 --> 01:46:15,742
but, um... that...

1355
01:46:19,849 --> 01:46:23,250
that when things started
to pan out for her,

1356
01:46:23,352 --> 01:46:26,253
I should have been
more supportive,

1357
01:46:26,355 --> 01:46:28,220
and, uh...

1358
01:46:28,324 --> 01:46:31,418
I just should have
been behind her more.

1359
01:46:34,363 --> 01:46:36,263
Oh, shit.

1360
01:46:38,868 --> 01:46:41,701
Tell her that, um...

1361
01:46:41,804 --> 01:46:44,705
that she's the best thing
that ever happened...

1362
01:46:44,807 --> 01:46:46,707
to a bum like me.

1363
01:46:48,310 --> 01:46:51,211
She's heard me say
"I love you"

1364
01:46:51,313 --> 01:46:52,712
a thousand times.

1365
01:46:52,815 --> 01:46:55,716
She never heard me
say "I'm sorry. "

1366
01:46:57,319 --> 01:47:00,220
I want you to
tell her that, Al.

1367
01:47:00,322 --> 01:47:02,722
I want you
to tell her...

1368
01:47:02,825 --> 01:47:05,726
thatJohn said
that he was sorry.

1369
01:47:05,828 --> 01:47:08,228
Okay?
You got that, man?

1370
01:47:08,330 --> 01:47:10,662
Yeah, I got it,John,

1371
01:47:10,766 --> 01:47:13,735
but you can
tell her that yourself.

1372
01:47:13,836 --> 01:47:16,737
Just watch your ass
and make it out.

1373
01:47:16,839 --> 01:47:18,238
You hear me?

1374
01:47:18,340 --> 01:47:21,332
I guess that's up to
the man upstairs.

1375
01:47:24,847 --> 01:47:28,749
John? John?

1376
01:47:28,851 --> 01:47:30,250
What the fuck...

1377
01:47:30,352 --> 01:47:31,751
were you doing
upstairs, Hans?

1378
01:47:33,856 --> 01:47:35,255
John?

1379
01:47:35,357 --> 01:47:36,756
Al, listen.

1380
01:47:36,859 --> 01:47:38,486
Just lay off
for a while.

1381
01:47:38,594 --> 01:47:41,859
<i>I got to go
check on something.</i>

1382
01:47:45,935 --> 01:47:48,699
One minute,
that's all I'm asking-

1383
01:47:48,804 --> 01:47:51,329
One minute
to speak to them.

1384
01:47:51,440 --> 01:47:53,704
All right.
Get back. Get back.

1385
01:47:53,809 --> 01:47:55,709
All right,
look, look, look.

1386
01:47:55,811 --> 01:48:01,875
<i>- Let me in right now,
or I call the I.N.S. Comprende?</i>

1387
01:48:01,984 --> 01:48:03,212
This is the last time
these kids will have...

1388
01:48:03,319 --> 01:48:05,219
to speak
to their parents.

1389
01:48:07,323 --> 01:48:08,722
- All right?
- Mm.

1390
01:48:08,824 --> 01:48:11,486
All right.
Come on.

1391
01:48:21,003 --> 01:48:23,369
What were you
doing, Hans?

1392
01:48:23,472 --> 01:48:25,838
What were you doing?

1393
01:48:47,396 --> 01:48:50,456
Jesus, Mary,
Mother of God.

1394
01:48:54,670 --> 01:48:56,297
It's a double-cross!

1395
01:48:56,405 --> 01:48:58,305
The roof is wired to-

1396
01:49:01,410 --> 01:49:02,308
John?

1397
01:49:04,914 --> 01:49:05,812
John!

1398
01:49:07,049 --> 01:49:08,812
John, come in!

1399
01:49:08,918 --> 01:49:10,818
Did you get that?

1400
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:12,820
Something about
a double-cross.

1401
01:49:12,922 --> 01:49:15,322
Tell me about it.

1402
01:49:20,930 --> 01:49:22,830
We are both
professionals.

1403
01:49:24,934 --> 01:49:26,834
This is personal.

1404
01:49:28,437 --> 01:49:29,836
Ah...

1405
01:49:31,140 --> 01:49:33,199
Aagh!

1406
01:49:44,253 --> 01:49:46,084
Aah!

1407
01:49:50,759 --> 01:49:52,793
They're coming!

1408
01:49:52,895 --> 01:49:54,795
The choppers
are coming.

1409
01:49:54,897 --> 01:49:56,296
Okay,

1410
01:49:56,398 --> 01:49:59,299
Time to gather your flock,
Miss Gennero.

1411
01:49:59,401 --> 01:50:03,201
<i>Your mom and dad
are very important people.</i>

1412
01:50:03,305 --> 01:50:05,603
<i>They're very brave people.</i>

1413
01:50:05,708 --> 01:50:09,041
<i>Is there something
you'd like to say to them?</i>

1414
01:50:09,144 --> 01:50:12,580
Come home.

1415
01:50:19,521 --> 01:50:22,319
Mrs. McClane.

1416
01:50:24,426 --> 01:50:29,557
How nice to make
your acquaintance.

1417
01:50:32,501 --> 01:50:34,401
Everyone
to the roof!

1418
01:50:34,503 --> 01:50:36,733
Lock them there.
Come right back.

1419
01:50:43,946 --> 01:50:44,844
Ah!

1420
01:51:03,932 --> 01:51:06,924
You should have heard
your brother squeal...

1421
01:51:07,036 --> 01:51:10,096
when I broke
his fucking neck!

1422
01:51:13,509 --> 01:51:15,875
What do you
figure the breakage?

1423
01:51:15,978 --> 01:51:17,878
We take out
the terrorists,

1424
01:51:17,980 --> 01:51:21,211
lose 20, 25%
of the hostages... tops.

1425
01:51:21,317 --> 01:51:23,217
I can live
with that.

1426
01:51:23,319 --> 01:51:25,810
Get this thing
on the deck.

1427
01:51:25,921 --> 01:51:29,220
They're expecting
transports, not gun ships.

1428
01:51:41,270 --> 01:51:42,897
Move it!

1429
01:51:43,005 --> 01:51:44,870
Come on! Move!

1430
01:51:44,973 --> 01:51:46,907
Move it!

1431
01:51:47,009 --> 01:51:48,909
Go! Move!

1432
01:51:52,014 --> 01:51:53,413
Theo.

1433
01:51:53,515 --> 01:51:55,415
A little bonus for us.

1434
01:51:55,517 --> 01:51:56,916
Please, sit down.

1435
01:51:57,019 --> 01:51:58,418
Sit down!

1436
01:51:58,520 --> 01:52:01,421
A policeman's wife
might come in handy.

1437
01:52:01,523 --> 01:52:04,424
McClane, I have
some news for you.

1438
01:52:04,526 --> 01:52:06,551
McClane.

1439
01:52:06,662 --> 01:52:07,594
Ah!

1440
01:52:13,369 --> 01:52:15,064
Aah!

1441
01:52:16,939 --> 01:52:18,429
Come on! Move!

1442
01:52:20,042 --> 01:52:21,441
Come on!

1443
01:52:30,386 --> 01:52:32,183
Yaah!

1444
01:52:34,056 --> 01:52:36,616
Motherfucker!
I'll kill you!

1445
01:52:39,995 --> 01:52:41,394
Armed.

1446
01:52:41,497 --> 01:52:42,896
The truck?

1447
01:52:42,998 --> 01:52:44,397
The truck.

1448
01:52:50,773 --> 01:52:52,400
After all
your posturing,

1449
01:52:52,508 --> 01:52:54,408
all your little
speeches,

1450
01:52:54,510 --> 01:52:58,071
you're nothing
but a common thief.

1451
01:52:58,180 --> 01:53:00,410
I am an exceptional thief,
Mrs. McClane,

1452
01:53:00,516 --> 01:53:02,347
and since I'm moving
up to kidnapping,

1453
01:53:02,451 --> 01:53:04,419
you should be
more polite.

1454
01:53:05,954 --> 01:53:07,012
Yaah!

1455
01:53:10,025 --> 01:53:11,515
Oh!

1456
01:53:11,627 --> 01:53:13,720
Going to kill you!

1457
01:53:13,829 --> 01:53:15,729
I'm going to
fucking cook you!

1458
01:53:15,831 --> 01:53:17,059
Going to fucking
eat you!

1459
01:53:39,755 --> 01:53:41,746
I don't
like this, Sarge.

1460
01:53:49,865 --> 01:53:52,265
Yaa-hah!

1461
01:53:52,367 --> 01:53:54,267
Just like
fucking Saigon,

1462
01:53:54,369 --> 01:53:55,927
Hey, slick?

1463
01:53:56,038 --> 01:53:59,769
I was in junior high,
dickhead.

1464
01:54:28,070 --> 01:54:29,469
Where's Holly?

1465
01:54:29,571 --> 01:54:30,970
Where's Holly Gennero?

1466
01:54:31,073 --> 01:54:32,973
Holly Gennero?
Where's Holly?

1467
01:54:33,075 --> 01:54:34,975
Where's Holly?
Where is she?

1468
01:54:35,077 --> 01:54:36,476
They took her!
Where?

1469
01:54:36,578 --> 01:54:37,977
The vault! Where is the vault?

1470
01:54:38,080 --> 01:54:39,911
The 30th floor!

1471
01:54:40,015 --> 01:54:41,414
They took her!

1472
01:54:41,517 --> 01:54:43,144
Get downstairs!

1473
01:54:43,252 --> 01:54:47,416
The whole fucking roof
is wired to blow!

1474
01:54:47,523 --> 01:54:50,686
Get down!
Get the fuck downstairs!

1475
01:54:52,361 --> 01:54:54,261
They made us, Bureau. You got a
terrorist shooting at hostages.

1476
01:54:54,363 --> 01:54:55,660
Break left!

1477
01:55:03,272 --> 01:55:04,762
Nail that sucker!

1478
01:55:13,081 --> 01:55:16,016
I'm on your side,
you assholes!

1479
01:55:16,118 --> 01:55:17,551
Swing around again!

1480
01:55:17,653 --> 01:55:19,143
I'll bag
this little bastard.

1481
01:55:38,106 --> 01:55:39,937
What the fuck...

1482
01:55:42,044 --> 01:55:44,945
Oh,John, what the fuck
are you doing?

1483
01:55:45,047 --> 01:55:48,448
How the fuck did you
get into this shit?

1484
01:55:49,985 --> 01:55:53,318
Aah! Aah!

1485
01:55:53,422 --> 01:55:55,583
Aah!

1486
01:55:55,691 --> 01:55:57,759
Aah!

1487
01:55:57,859 --> 01:56:01,260
There's something wrong!
They're coming back down!

1488
01:56:01,363 --> 01:56:02,387
Blow the roof.

1489
01:56:02,497 --> 01:56:03,725
Karl's up there!

1490
01:56:03,832 --> 01:56:04,821
Blow the roof!

1491
01:56:08,303 --> 01:56:11,204
I promise
I will never even think...

1492
01:56:11,306 --> 01:56:14,070
about going up
in a tall building again.

1493
01:56:16,345 --> 01:56:19,314
Oh, God,
please don't let me die!

1494
01:56:33,328 --> 01:56:34,818
Yaah!

1495
01:57:03,692 --> 01:57:05,626
Oh!

1496
01:57:24,646 --> 01:57:25,704
Aah!

1497
01:57:25,814 --> 01:57:27,008
Aah!

1498
01:57:51,473 --> 01:57:53,373
Holy Christ!

1499
01:57:54,476 --> 01:57:55,500
We're
going to need...

1500
01:57:55,610 --> 01:57:57,737
some more
FBI guys, I guess.

1501
01:57:57,846 --> 01:57:59,677
Aah! Aah!

1502
01:58:10,559 --> 01:58:12,686
Jesus fucking Christ!

1503
01:58:12,794 --> 01:58:14,193
Fuck!

1504
01:58:38,854 --> 01:58:41,254
What the fuck
is going on?

1505
01:58:42,557 --> 01:58:44,149
What are you going to do?

1506
01:58:44,259 --> 01:58:45,817
Sit here while
the building falls?

1507
01:58:54,336 --> 01:58:56,065
Shit!

1508
01:58:56,171 --> 01:58:57,661
Oh! All right!

1509
01:58:57,773 --> 01:58:59,172
Uli.

1510
01:58:59,274 --> 01:59:00,639
Hey!
Hey!

1511
01:59:00,742 --> 01:59:02,676
Hang on, baby.

1512
01:59:02,778 --> 01:59:05,178
Hang on, honey.

1513
01:59:05,280 --> 01:59:07,043
Oh, God.

1514
01:59:39,748 --> 01:59:40,976
Oh!

1515
01:59:45,120 --> 01:59:45,984
<i>Allez! Allez vite!</i>

1516
01:59:46,087 --> 01:59:48,419
<i>J'y vais!
J'y vais!</i>

1517
01:59:52,327 --> 01:59:53,851
Hans!

1518
02:00:08,009 --> 02:00:10,239
Jesus.

1519
02:00:10,345 --> 02:00:12,176
Hi, honey.

1520
02:00:33,735 --> 02:00:36,829
So that's what this
is all about?

1521
02:00:36,938 --> 02:00:38,337
A fucking robbery?

1522
02:00:38,440 --> 02:00:40,271
Put down the gun.

1523
02:00:40,375 --> 02:00:44,311
Why'd you have to nuke
the whole building, Hans?

1524
02:00:44,412 --> 02:00:46,312
Well, when
you steal $600,

1525
02:00:46,414 --> 02:00:47,438
you can disappear.

1526
02:00:47,549 --> 02:00:49,449
When you steal
600 million,

1527
02:00:49,551 --> 02:00:50,518
they'll find you...

1528
02:00:50,619 --> 02:00:53,019
unless they think
you're already dead.

1529
02:00:53,121 --> 02:00:54,986
Put down the gun.

1530
02:01:01,930 --> 02:01:03,989
Uh.

1531
02:01:05,634 --> 02:01:07,124
<i>Nein. This is mine.</i>

1532
02:01:09,237 --> 02:01:11,171
You got me.

1533
02:01:11,273 --> 02:01:15,232
<i>Still the cowboy,
Mr. McClane.</i>

1534
02:01:15,343 --> 02:01:16,742
Americans, all alike.

1535
02:01:16,845 --> 02:01:19,473
This time,John Wayne doesn't
walk off into the sunset...

1536
02:01:19,581 --> 02:01:21,014
with Grace Kelly.

1537
02:01:21,116 --> 02:01:22,947
That was Gary Cooper,
asshole.

1538
02:01:23,051 --> 02:01:24,814
Enough jokes.

1539
02:01:24,920 --> 02:01:26,319
You'd have made...

1540
02:01:26,421 --> 02:01:27,786
a good cowboy
yourself, Hans.

1541
02:01:27,889 --> 02:01:29,288
Oh, yeah.

1542
02:01:29,391 --> 02:01:32,519
What was it you said
to me before?

1543
02:01:32,627 --> 02:01:36,119
Yippee-kai-yay,
motherfucker.

1544
02:01:57,185 --> 02:01:58,447
Holly!

1545
02:02:03,258 --> 02:02:05,453
Happy trails, Hans.

1546
02:02:10,665 --> 02:02:11,632
Aah!

1547
02:02:11,733 --> 02:02:12,631
Holly.

1548
02:02:14,703 --> 02:02:16,830
Aah!

1549
02:02:50,005 --> 02:02:52,064
I hope that's
not a hostage.

1550
02:03:20,402 --> 02:03:23,894
<i>Water hook-up
companies 93, 96-</i>

1551
02:03:24,005 --> 02:03:25,666
<i>Must have burned down
the whole building.</i>

1552
02:03:27,776 --> 02:03:30,176
Over here.
It's a better angle.

1553
02:03:30,278 --> 02:03:32,109
Let's give them...

1554
02:03:34,215 --> 02:03:37,116
Keep it going, now.
Keep it going.

1555
02:03:42,724 --> 02:03:45,124
Come on.
We're going to miss it!

1556
02:03:45,226 --> 02:03:47,126
Okay.
Hand me my notes!

1557
02:04:07,015 --> 02:04:08,414
Come on, folks.

1558
02:04:08,516 --> 02:04:10,916
What was it like
in there?

1559
02:04:11,019 --> 02:04:13,283
How did they
treat you?

1560
02:04:58,867 --> 02:05:01,267
Al, this is
my wife Holly.

1561
02:05:01,369 --> 02:05:02,768
Holly Gennero.

1562
02:05:02,871 --> 02:05:04,270
Holly McClane.

1563
02:05:04,372 --> 02:05:06,135
Hello, Holly.

1564
02:05:06,241 --> 02:05:08,641
You got yourself
a good man.

1565
02:05:08,743 --> 02:05:11,109
You take
good care of him.

1566
02:05:12,380 --> 02:05:13,870
<i>McClane!</i>

1567
02:05:13,982 --> 02:05:15,882
McClane,
I want a debriefing!

1568
02:05:15,984 --> 02:05:17,383
You got some things...

1569
02:05:17,485 --> 02:05:18,884
to answer for,
mister-

1570
02:05:18,987 --> 02:05:21,251
Ellis' murder,
for one thing,

1571
02:05:21,356 --> 02:05:22,618
<i>property damage,</i>

1572
02:05:22,724 --> 02:05:25,124
<i>interfering with
police business.</i>

1573
02:06:04,165 --> 02:06:07,100
<i>All right!
Two of you go inside...</i>

1574
02:06:07,202 --> 02:06:09,602
<i>- and see if there's
anybody else! - Yes, sir-</i>

1575
02:06:19,881 --> 02:06:21,781
This one's with me.

1576
02:06:31,893 --> 02:06:33,292
Mr. McClane.
Mr. McClane!

1577
02:06:33,394 --> 02:06:36,090
After this
incredible ordeal,

1578
02:06:36,197 --> 02:06:38,222
what are
your feelings?

1579
02:06:42,203 --> 02:06:45,229
Well, well, well.

1580
02:06:45,340 --> 02:06:47,240
Merry Christmas,
Argyle.

1581
02:06:47,342 --> 02:06:48,570
Merry Christmas.

1582
02:06:51,512 --> 02:06:53,742
Did you get that?

1583
02:06:53,848 --> 02:06:55,247
Let me through.

1584
02:06:55,350 --> 02:06:58,251
If this is their idea
of Christmas,

1585
02:06:58,353 --> 02:07:01,254
I got to be here
for New Year's.
