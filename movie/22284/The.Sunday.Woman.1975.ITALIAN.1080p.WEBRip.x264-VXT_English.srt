1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,200
Having a company like mine,
shortens your life.

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,720
Each year is worth three.

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,840
Today, for example,
I must face a tough day.

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,200
Two hours of factory council.

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,040
The workers will fire
their threats

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,760
because they know
we are about to go on vacation.

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,400
They don't realize
that they risk not reaching

8
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,720
the feared "hot autumn",
and they increase demands.

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,480
Benito, some water, please.
Problems always increase.

10
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,800
I will end up having to close.

11
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,120
I admit you're an intelligent
man, dear Massimo.

12
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,680
More than my husband
who only talks about the company,

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,880
the economical crisis,
and his liver.

14
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,480
But you've become unbearable too,

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,840
with your mania
of giving me lessons.

16
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,640
The Boston matter is much
more serious than you think.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,400
By involving architect Garrone,
you passed every limit.

18
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,560
- Bye.
- Going for a stroll? Be a good girl.

19
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,880
Bye.

20
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,720
Bonetto says that Americans
eat little.

21
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,080
- Boston.
- No, they are from Detroit.

22
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,560
- Maybe I will have dinner with them.
- Benito!

23
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,400
You must use a tray and gloves,
and button your collar!

24
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,040
I can't stand them anymore!
Neither him, nor her.

25
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,560
They even broke unbreakable
glasses. I'll fire them!

26
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,920
Anna Carla, we tried them all,
Philippines, Portuguese...

27
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:51,080
Now we're back to Sardinians,
and they're not as they were.

28
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,720
If I have dinner with them,
I'll call you.

29
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,040
With the Sardinians?

30
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,920
With the Americans
who want to buy the Bra factory.

31
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,680
What are you doing?

32
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,480
- I'll start packing.
- Very good.

33
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,200
Boston...

34
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:36,120
SUNDAY WOMAN

35
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,240
- Good morning to all.
- Good morning, architect.

36
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,000
Hi, beautiful. A token, please.

37
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,520
What a neckline!

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,600
Know the difference
between you and me, today?

39
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,520
I'm abreast of the wind and
you have the wind in your breast!

40
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,640
That one was great!

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,400
Good morning.
This is architect Garrone.

42
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,720
We had said today.
Alright, at 10:30 p.m.

43
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,200
In my office. Perfect.
My respects.

44
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,920
Bye, guys.

45
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,600
Architect, shall I
thin it out in the back?

46
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,600
What time does "Le Arti"
movie theater open?

47
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:03,000
3:30. They're showing "La sferza",
a Third World country film.

48
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,120
It is artistic, but powerful.
There are four screws.

49
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,440
If I see it twice, I get out at 7
and the screws are 8!

50
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,200
- Shall I thin it out?
- Thin it out.

51
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,280
Dear Massimo,
what separates us, isn't Boston,

52
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,600
but architect Garrone.

53
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,560
I can't stand him. Such horrible
people must be eliminated.

54
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,120
Good evening.

55
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,560
Just a minute.

56
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:52,240
It's said to be from the workshop of
the great Emilia painter, Correggio.

57
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:57,200
Believe me,
5 million is a ridiculous amount!

58
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:02,920
In a proper living room,
something like that is a bit "osÃ©".

59
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,800
- You have children?
- They're grown up.

60
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,760
- There're the grandchildren.
- They visit us every Sunday.

61
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,880
Forget it. It's 5 million!

62
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,200
Let's make it 4 million.

63
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,360
Excuse me.
I'll go look for a drink.

64
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,720
Well?

65
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,600
Maybe we'll be back later.

66
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,840
Garrone is arrogant but I feel
sorry for him because he's a loner.

67
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,520
There're many like him in America.
Losers, rejects, outcasts.

68
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,080
They find a low level audience.

69
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,600
But with us,
they are a race in extinction.

70
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,160
No, that race never dies.

71
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,280
Only if you kill them!

72
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,400
Why are you putting in order
if they fired us?

73
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,120
Benito, look what nice
cigarette butts.

74
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,160
Cigarettes are costly.
I won't leave them as a gift.

75
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,680
A gift? A gift?

76
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,520
There are two here.
Look what she did to these.

77
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:20,080
Maybe the lady was very nervous.

78
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,800
"Dear Massimo"...
Is it the Ivrea man?

79
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,920
No, that's Massimiliano.
This one is Massimo Campi.

80
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,080
Her husband called saying he was
having dinner with the Americans,

81
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,040
so she went to him.
They are in bed together now.

82
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,160
Read here. He wants to kill
Garrone. Who is he?

83
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,280
- Must be another lover.
- And Boston?

84
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,240
Another lover too.

85
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,360
The richer they are, the more they
are sluts. This one, even a murderer!

86
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,520
- Massimo!
- Yes, Mom?

87
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,120
- You're not having dinner with us?
- No, not tonight. Bye.

88
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,200
Let's go home.
I don't want to see that sign.

89
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,680
The Monnais have decided
to sell lots too.

90
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,440
We'll have another condominium
with tennis and pool next to us!

91
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,800
Why don't we sell land lots too?

92
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,760
- Massimo never comes anyway.
- Thank you!

93
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:42,240
I think that American groups
that buy Italian industries

94
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,560
don't only do it for
economical interests...

95
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,840
"Rice, scallops, wine."

96
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,280
- Fruit?
- Banana.

97
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,880
- By the way, you have a boyfriend?
- No.

98
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,000
- A lovely girl like you...
- That's 3,200.

99
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,520
You like movies? Dancing?
A vacation in the Bahamas?

100
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,480
As of tomorrow,
I can fulfil all your desires.

101
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,240
Don't talk about it.
It is our secret,

102
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,640
made up of trips, love and bananas!

103
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:07,600
- 3,200.
- Keep the change.

104
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,280
800 Lira tip!

105
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,840
- Miss.
- Yes?

106
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,600
If I were your boyfriend,

107
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,160
I'd stop that disgusting guy
from telling you such things!

108
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,480
I had gotten to
the Po River front, Chief.

109
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,040
It was hot.

110
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,760
I stayed there 15 minutes,
walking my dog.

111
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,720
He is intelligent, like all dogs.

112
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,480
Those who don't love animals...

113
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,520
What time did I return home?
Must have been 11.

114
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,760
Maybe a few minutes later.

115
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:20,320
Maybe I wouldn't have noticed
that Garrone's door was open,

116
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,480
but the dog stuck his face inside.
I yelled...

117
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,840
"Oh, Lord!"

118
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,840
- What'd you write?
- "Oh, Lord!"

119
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,600
Copiello, hold back
your drama vocation.

120
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,600
Mr. Bauchiero,
please try to remember

121
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,600
all you noticed
going towards the door.

122
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,320
Let's make an effort.

123
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,520
"Born in Cagliari on March 14, 1931."

124
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,680
And herein, resident of Torino.

125
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,240
- "Herein"?
- Don't you say that?

126
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,520
You say it in Cagliari,
we are in Turin here.

127
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,280
- You don't say "herein" in Turin?
- No.

128
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,600
We always said "herein"
to the Cagliari carabinieri.

129
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,600
Well?

130
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,400
The blond woman was coming
from the door.

131
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,320
She wasn't particularly
beautiful or elegant.

132
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,480
She was wearing
a very transparent raincoat.

133
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,240
- Like a condom?
- Yes.

134
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,800
She had an orange shoulder strap
purse. She was rather tall.

135
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,360
- Copiello, did you write?
- No.

136
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,800
Write.

137
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,200
"When he returned home,
the witness Bauchiero remembers..."

138
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,320
- A detail. May I?
- We are greedy for details.

139
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,440
There was a design on the purse.
What color? White.

140
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,200
It was am emblem.
What type?

141
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,360
- You're asking the questions?
- To be exact.

142
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,120
It was the five-pointed Italian star.

143
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,240
- Write.
- Just a moment.

144
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,760
- Don't write.
- I just thought of something.

145
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,120
That lady had a handkerchief
raised to her nose

146
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,240
as if to dry the perspiration.

147
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,200
So I can't describe her face
or her age.

148
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,920
In her hand she had a tube,
a cylinder object.

149
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,080
If you don't put "herein",
we'll take the letter away.

150
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,600
- What is going on?
- They are two servants.

151
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,360
They were fired and they came
here to report them.

152
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,680
- We must show them this.
- We came here

153
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,400
as soon as we found out
that poor man had been killed.

154
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,600
- What poor man?
- Read.

155
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,880
- Who wrote this letter?
- Mrs. Anna Carla Dosio.

156
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,920
"Dear Massimo, aside from
everything else, Boston or..."

157
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,320
Try with glasses.

158
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,920
"I can't stand
architect Garrone anymore.

159
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,800
Let's find a way to eliminate him.

160
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,920
It will be better for both.

161
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,880
A.C. Dosio."

162
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,240
- That Dosio?
- Yes.

163
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,200
- Who is this Massimo?
- Massimo Campi.

164
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,160
- That Campi?
- Yes.

165
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,120
Dosio, Campi... Shit!

166
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,720
Do these domestic helpers
have a record?

167
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,680
No, sir.

168
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,000
What should we do?
The magistrate...

169
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,080
I'll take care of Mr. Mulas.

170
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,720
One of you make contact with
the people mentioned, with caution.

171
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:35,720
The other, follow other leads,
more concrete ones.

172
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,680
Two chiefs are wasted
for just one murder.

173
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,640
Since these two people
are suspected,

174
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,760
it is a very delicate matter.

175
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,640
Who will question Mr. Campi
and the lady?

176
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,280
- Him!
- You decide.

177
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:58,360
Watch out for the journalists.
A silk hand in a velvet glove.

178
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,480
Considering the level,
you should take care of it

179
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,600
because you're always elegant
and know Latin proverbs.

180
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,800
I see. We'll flip a coin.

181
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,240
This one. Let me see.

182
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,360
- You don't trust me?
- Will my son go out?

183
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,920
Yes, he will.

184
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,080
- How did they kill that Garrone?
- With this.

185
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,800
A phallic shaped stone,
of Pompei inspiration.

186
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,240
It belonged to the dead man
or the killer brought it from home?

187
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,160
Mystery.

188
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,080
Develop it right away
and make ten copies.

189
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,440
- Done. Anything else?
- Didn't you smoke Nazionali?

190
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:43,000
I see. When Mrs. Dosio comes,
will you offer her champagne?

191
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,440
How nice!
This is very bad for me.

192
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,200
- What were we saying?
- Do you know Anna Carla Dosio?

193
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,520
- I've seen her in the papers.
- What is she like?

194
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,680
How do you imagine the wife
of a big northern industrialist?

195
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,800
- Tall, a good looker.
- Exact answer!

196
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:09,600
Massimo Campi, son of another
big northern industrialist...

197
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,400
Mr. Campi Massimo.

198
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,640
I'll be going.

199
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,200
Good morning. My pleasure.
Santamaria. Sit down.

200
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,520
Forgive me for being late.

201
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,920
I don't have a car and finding
taxis has become difficult.

202
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,400
I'd have come to your place,
but you preferred here.

203
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,720
- You don't have a car?
- I haven't, for three years.

204
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,840
I used to have an Aston Martin.
I'm still ashamed.

205
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It's more practical without a car.

206
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,760
- It's hot!
- Yes, but it's cool at night.

207
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:46,440
At our home on the hill last night,
we couldn't dine on the terrace.

208
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,440
Last night you were on the hill?

209
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:55,440
You called me for advice.
What sort of advice?

210
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,800
- Would you like one?
- You have a Nazionale?

211
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,680
I happen to have them.

212
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,160
- Please.
- Thank you.

213
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,920
It is an intricate situation,

214
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,280
where I risk giving
a terrible impression.

215
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,800
But I am sure you'll understand.

216
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,120
"Non flere, non indignari,
sed intelligere."

217
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,880
Unfortunately, I don't know Latin.

218
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,240
How did you get this letter?

219
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,920
We don't usually listen
to fired domestic help, but...

220
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,920
Those two!
I didn't know they'd been fired.

221
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:56,760
This morning they read the papers
and brought this,

222
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,320
putting us in an unpleasant
situation.

223
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,520
What did they read in the papers?

224
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:07,280
- You didn't read them?
- I never do. Why?

225
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,800
Architect Garrone was killed
last night in his office.

226
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,760
"With a strange stone object."
What is it?

227
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,880
The second item.

228
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,640
It is worthy of him! Funny...

229
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,280
The funny part, in certain
situations, is very precarious.

230
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,240
"Let's find a way to eliminate him."

231
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,200
It is a real coincidence!

232
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,320
Now I understand.
But I can explain.

233
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,040
May I have a coffee?

234
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,200
Yes. We have a vending machine.

235
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,360
You give it to suspects too?

236
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,240
Yes, but we put
some truth serum inside.

237
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,880
I'm sure there's some in here.

238
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,640
Then I'll tell you everything!

239
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:13,400
Everything began with the word
"Boston". How do you pronounce it?

240
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,120
Mrs. Dosio pronounces it
the American way.

241
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,560
I corrected her and we argued.
A complete rupture!

242
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,800
No, excuse me. This way.

243
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:31,160
- What's Garrone have to do with it?
- We barely know him.

244
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:36,400
We meet him everywhere,
and we used him...

245
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:40,320
- In what way?
- In our private theater.

246
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,480
- Charity performances?
- No, it's just a game

247
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,800
where we cite someone
to indicate what must not be done.

248
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:52,560
For example, we say,
"a Bonetto style tie".

249
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,120
- For...
- And Boston?

250
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:00,080
Garrone was the type to pronounce
"Boston" the American way

251
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,800
to let everyone know
he knew English.

252
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,360
I find these linguistic
exhibitions silly.

253
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,480
It's true.

254
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,440
Did Mrs. Dosio
know Garrone well?

255
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:16,480
No. He disgusted her. That's why
she wrote, "eliminate him",

256
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,920
meaning, to exclude him
from our games.

257
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,840
I stole too much of your time.
Excuse me.

258
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,400
No, I must apologize. Listen...

259
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:29,720
Who do you think had a real
reason to eliminate Garrone?

260
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,840
Real reason?
It is something to look into.

261
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Let me think about it.

262
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,120
I will call you soon.

263
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,600
Is my son going out?

264
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,040
Yes, he is.

265
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,360
- What sort of type is he?
- He chuckles over a dead man,

266
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,440
and does a scene
for the pronunciation of a word.

267
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,720
- To be filed under the letter "S".
- As "suspects"?

268
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,280
- "Shitheads"!
- "Shitheads and suspects"!

269
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,280
What is it?

270
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,920
- Hi, Francesca.
- Hi.

271
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:53,080
- Good morning. Is Mrs. Dosio in?
- Come.

272
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,040
It was kind of you to come.

273
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,000
- Wait before speaking.
- Why?

274
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,720
Later.

275
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,640
I was in a crisis for two days.

276
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:11,000
I was about to write to you.
Then I threw the letter away.

277
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,200
- In the waste paper basket?
- Yes.

278
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:18,280
I decided to speak to you frankly.
Want something to drink?

279
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,120
Coffee, but later. Speak now.

280
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,760
The correct pronunciation is...

281
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,120
So I am right in saying...

282
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,640
It's right, it's logical.

283
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
It is natural for me to say...

284
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,120
It is not ostentatious.

285
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,840
Otherwise all the people of Ponza
would be ostentatious.

286
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,640
What's Ponza have to do with it?

287
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,800
They are emigrants who returned
from America. They all say...

288
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,240
You must stop accusing me
of being like that awful Garrone.

289
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,880
Is that why you wrote the moment
had come to "eliminate" him?

290
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,680
How do you know?

291
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:06,880
You'll have to make coffee,
since you fired Benito and Maria.

292
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,680
I'm going.

293
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,280
Don't drive me crazy!

294
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,320
What is it?

295
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,440
- You know where I just was?
- No.

296
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,560
At the police station.
A very nice chief

297
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,520
showed me the letter
of a thoughtless woman

298
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,000
who writes an instigation to murder.

299
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,920
What? Those two!

300
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,880
Sardinian revenge!

301
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,440
We raised the salaries
of policemen

302
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,080
so that they listen to
the gossip of the domestic help!

303
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,600
If you wrote less and read more,

304
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,120
you'd known from the papers
that yesterday Garrone was killed.

305
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:52,880
- Who killed him?
- You and I are the only suspects.

306
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,160
- Because of that letter?
- Yes.

307
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
- It's wonderful.
- Why are you laughing?

308
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,720
The situation is serious.
What'd you do last night?

309
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:13,680
An alibi? I don't have one.
I walked along the Po.

310
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:19,240
And I imagined you'd have said
it was a Cineclub landscape.

311
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,800
- Then what did you do?
- I went to the movies.

312
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,360
- You have witnesses?
- No. Do you have an alibi?

313
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,880
- Don't get off track. Later?
- I returned home.

314
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:33,440
Vittorio was at dinner with the
Americans, the servants were asleep.

315
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:37,320
The chief didn't believe
the "Boston" thing.

316
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,840
Does he suspect me?
When will he question me?

317
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,440
It's the first exciting thing
that has happened to me

318
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,880
since I got a flat tire
four years ago.

319
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:27,000
- Are you tired?
- A little.

320
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,280
Will you season it yourself?

321
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:40,040
Massimo, this year
we must go to Greece.

322
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:44,240
A woman colleague of mine
was there last year.

323
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,520
The sea is purple.

324
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,040
Look.

325
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,760
It looks like a jellyfish.

326
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,360
The islands are amazing!

327
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Everyone is going to Greece this year.

328
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,120
In fact! We have to see it!

329
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,800
Just a minute!

330
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,680
A lot of people I know go there.

331
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,760
Your billionaire friends!

332
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,520
We aren't obliged to go to Greece.

333
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,080
Are the Aeolian Islands okay?

334
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,240
- Taste it.
- No, I trust you.

335
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:31,000
There is nothing.
No electricity, water or gas.

336
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,280
You, me and Nature!

337
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:37,040
In the morning the fishermen
bring you lobsters for breakfast.

338
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,600
Massimo...

339
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,200
What's the matter?

340
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,440
I prefer coffee for breakfast.

341
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,360
You're not interested.

342
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:58,520
Of course I am.
It must be beautiful. But...

343
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,040
I was thinking of
a more domestic place.

344
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,280
Like what?

345
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:07,800
- The villa in Monferrato.
- You never go.

346
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:11,920
I had it restructured
and would like to go there.

347
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,440
- Lello...
- Yes?

348
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,200
- The point is...
- It's all very clear!

349
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,280
You hoped I wouldn't accept
the vacation in Monferrato,

350
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,240
since I have a 24 day vacation.

351
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,600
Isn't that so?

352
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,400
Okay, still friends!

353
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:38,520
Will I see you again or will
you stay in Monferrato forever?

354
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,680
- Let me go!
- Don't do this!

355
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,440
There's another reason
that stops me from going abroad.

356
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,720
- I didn't want to tell you...
- A secret?

357
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,640
Yes! With a woman friend,
the police and myself.

358
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,520
- Are you kidding?
- Not at all.

359
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,080
- What're you saying?
- It's the truth.

360
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,600
- It deals with a murder.
- It can't be!

361
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,720
Tell me. You can trust me.

362
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:08,760
Architect Garrone is dead. He did
projects for funeral monuments.

363
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,880
I read it in the paper.
What have you got to do with it?

364
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,040
I've nothing to do with it.

365
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,560
Because of a strange
misunderstanding,

366
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,680
this friend of mine...
You know her, Anna Carla.

367
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,240
We are involved.

368
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,000
Massimo, excuse me, excuse me.

369
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:30,160
After so much searching,
I found out where he went.

370
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,040
What? What did you say?

371
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,560
- Riviera Lello.
- What?

372
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,600
What do you know about him?

373
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,560
I asked and asked,
and finally found out.

374
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:51,120
He works at Town Hall.

375
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,440
He is a "gay" guy.

376
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,680
He is "passive".

377
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,320
He's homosexual!

378
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,160
Why are you speaking in Sicilian?

379
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:06,280
So the people here won't understand.

380
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,320
Townsman, we understood everything!

381
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,880
- What are you thinking?
- Nothing.

382
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:19,360
No. You're thinking
about the Garrone homicide.

383
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,800
You were here last night.

384
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,840
You have an alibi.
Why didn't you tell the chief?

385
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,640
You were ashamed of telling him.

386
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,720
It would have served no purpose.

387
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:40,040
I was here, but I left at 10:30.

388
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Then I took a streetcar.

389
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:47,720
When I arrived home,
nobody saw me. They were sleeping.

390
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,600
I would have had enough time
to kill Garrone.

391
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,440
Kill me too.
That way I won't suffer.

392
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,160
You are so stupid!

393
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,160
We must show that you are innocent.

394
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:07,440
Sure! Don't worry.

395
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,520
Chief Santamaria,
Anna Carla Dosio.

396
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,080
My pleasure.

397
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,760
Sit down, please.

398
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,920
- I was thinking of De Quincey.
- Who?

399
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:26,160
The author of "On Murder Considered
One of the Fine Arts".

400
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:30,040
- Yes, sure!
- Want something to drink, Chief?

401
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,440
A drink.

402
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,240
- Scotch?
- Yes.

403
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,520
Who would have an interest
in killing Garrone?

404
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,280
A non motivated crime
is a seducing hypothesis nowadays.

405
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,800
No! Let's forget seductions
and use our heads.

406
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:50,040
A non motivated crime
must really be such.

407
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:53,560
Instead, many people
hated the victim.

408
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,160
Am I right?

409
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:58,720
I was talking about
an aesthetic crime.

410
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:02,200
Let's come to the point.
Right, chief?

411
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,720
And so?

412
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,440
Mr. Campi's theories
are very interesting.

413
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,840
Thank you.

414
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,120
You men always support
one another. A Mafia!

415
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,720
Are you Sicilian? Excuse me.

416
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:24,280
No, I'm Roman.
Not all chiefs are Sicilian.

417
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,680
And not all Sicilians are Mafia.

418
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,920
How kind of you!

419
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,440
My being polemic
was because I wanted to help you.

420
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:35,000
If you prefer continuing
your literary debate, go ahead.

421
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:39,160
No, madam. Help me
in a concrete way, please.

422
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:44,800
You want to know if Massimo
and I have an alibi?

423
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:49,280
Anna Carla, let the chief
say that.

424
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,680
Say it.

425
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,840
Alright. What is your alibi?

426
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:00,200
- Excuse me. Lunch is ready.
- Yes. Thank you, Teresa.

427
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:03,720
In the worst theater works,
that line closes the scene.

428
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,080
It is a rule for eating serenely.

429
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,800
Chief. I don't have an alibi.

430
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:15,240
But I know something about Garrone
that could help the investigation.

431
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,760
What is that?

432
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,880
I've a girlfriend called Bona.
One day she dragged me

433
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:24,120
to a conference
on child masturbation.

434
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:29,240
Garrone was there. He doesn't have
children so it was for personal lust.

435
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:33,560
Bona began talking with him
while I waited for my husband.

436
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:39,520
When Bona left, Garrone stared
at me and made a disgusting gesture.

437
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:42,840
- What did you do?
- What could I do?

438
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,880
Every time I saw him,
he made that horrible gesture.

439
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:51,440
That's who Garrone was,
and that's what was between us.

440
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:54,760
It's a bond, a mysterious complicity
between victim and executioner.

441
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:58,160
The crystal clear lady realizes she
has a bond with an shady individual

442
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:01,280
in an obscene relationship,
and she kills him.

443
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,360
Imbecile! Even Vittorio
laughed about it!

444
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,480
We are trying to help
the investigation.

445
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,640
Vittorio Dosio is her husband.

446
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:13,360
He laughed about it, but maybe
was furious. Another suspect.

447
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,400
I am helping the investigation,
right, chief?

448
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,640
Did your husband know Garrone?

449
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
I don't think so.
He heard us talk about him.

450
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:27,080
Massimo, will you please
tell us your alibi?

451
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:31,880
I don't have one. Those who don't
have an alibi are innocent, right?

452
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,160
A murderer always prepares one.

453
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,400
Then I'm innocent too!

454
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,160
Too easy!
Anna Carla has half an alibi.

455
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,800
She went to the movies,
but nobody saw her.

456
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,360
All murderers go to the movies
on the crime evening.

457
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,120
So do the victims!

458
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,040
- You want to know which theater?
- Yes.

459
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:58,440
The theater "Le Arti".
The film was "La sferza".

460
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,240
Garrone went to see
that movie too.

461
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,920
Do you think they are lovers?

462
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:13,280
- Then who is the woman?
- Anna Carla Dosio!

463
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,560
Paolo, what are you saying?

464
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:22,120
Wake up, Bettina!
Are you being Sleeping Beauty?

465
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,240
Your Massimo is 40 years old!

466
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,640
What is it?

467
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:46,640
I thought of the crime weapon
that killed Garrone!

468
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:50,400
I told you what it is.

469
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:01,160
"Live by the sword,
die by the sword!"

470
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:07,400
If it belongs to the murderer,
that phallic shaped stone is a lead.

471
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:11,360
- Sir, the telephone.
- Yes. Excuse me.

472
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,240
Thank you.

473
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,560
You know.

474
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,760
You must tell me!
Tell me, "I love you".

475
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:38,920
I am with two office colleagues.

476
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:42,400
I am working
to get you out of trouble.

477
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,520
No. I can't tell you anything else.
Tell me you love me.

478
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,360
I already told you.

479
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,520
I love you.

480
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,920
You're not taking your jacket off?

481
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,440
No, thank you.

482
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,120
- What are you thinking?
- And you?

483
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:09,080
You are implying,
"I ask the questions here"?

484
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:15,720
I was thinking that today
is different from other days.

485
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,200
For me too.

486
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:22,000
- You are not suspected.
- Nor are you.

487
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:25,920
Don't say that, or I'll go back
to my daily gray routine,

488
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,760
packing suitcases for our vacation.

489
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:33,200
By "different" I meant...

490
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,920
pleasant.

491
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,640
- For me too.
- You repeat what I say?

492
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,120
What?

493
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,720
I can't imagine...

494
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,760
how a chief spends his free time.

495
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,200
I listen to symphonic music,
I read...

496
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,720
I will be free next Sunday.

497
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,480
- Yes, sugar...
- Love! My joy!

498
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:04,040
Excuse me.
It was an old, boring aunt.

499
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,760
Chief...

500
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,640
Did Anna Carla accumulate
more evidence against me?

501
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,480
This is an invitation
to the Vollero Gallery.

502
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,360
I received one too,
but I didn't go.

503
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,360
Garrone always went to eat
at exhibition buffets.

504
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,560
Surely he went there.
That is a good lead.

505
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,840
- Want me to accompany you?
- Thank you, don't bother.

506
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,640
"Painting and mythology
at the Vollero gallery."

507
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,400
I will go.

508
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:33,920
You've a fixation with that crime!
So many things happen today...

509
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,280
It is a mysterious crime.

510
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,800
It's not the usual robbery
with road blocks and shootings.

511
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,080
I think the murder is someone
from the high class world.

512
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,400
No. It's Bauchiero,
the man who called the police.

513
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,360
- Why?
- In half the cases,

514
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,160
the murderer is the person
who finds the body.

515
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,800
Maybe Bauchiero did projects
for funeral monuments too.

516
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,280
Tribetti, will you show me your
archive of tombs and burial niches?

517
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,800
- Hey, don't bring bad luck!
- Cerioni!

518
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,800
- When are you closing?
- I don't know.

519
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,440
Nobody wants to leave the city
for fear of thieves.

520
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,920
If we've come to the point
of having to give up vacation

521
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,280
to guard our apartment,

522
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,080
to avoid having the
Impressionist paintings stolen,

523
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,120
than I will move to Switzerland.

524
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,640
Mrs. Tabusso, you can't
rest assured either.

525
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,760
There is much crime in your area.

526
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,880
Whoever would've imagined
that my home at "Le Buone Pere"

527
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,800
it'd become a red light area!

528
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:40,160
- Do couples go there?
- Couples?

529
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,200
It is full of prostitutes!

530
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:47,000
Watch out! You're hurting me!
There are prostitutes and pimps.

531
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:51,520
Every morning my sister and I,
on the law in front of our home,

532
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,880
pick up condoms!

533
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,160
I made out many reports to
the police, but nobody cares.

534
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,680
- I know a police chief.
- Talk to him about it.

535
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,600
- He's in the Public Morality squad?
- He's working on the Garrone crime.

536
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,720
We are witnesses of
a total degradation of customs.

537
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,680
Everyone complains,
but nobody does his duty.

538
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,440
- Except for Bauchiero.
- Who is he?

539
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:21,320
He found Garrone's body
and contacted the police.

540
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:26,480
Then he strained his memory
and remembered the blond.

541
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:30,320
- But they didn't catch the murderer.
- He put them on the right track.

542
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:35,440
With the detail of the tube
and the bag with the Italian star.

543
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:39,800
- Starfish.
- What are you saying?

544
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,680
- The star.
- How do you know?

545
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,720
I saw it!

546
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,400
Excuse me.

547
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,520
Everyone, get rid of the jinx!

548
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,840
- Find anything?
- No.

549
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:57,840
Bauchiero could be here among
the poor people who do projects

550
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,200
for family tombs, in the hope
that someone will buy them!

551
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,920
They don't understand
that there is no more room.

552
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,560
Even a burial niche is a waste.

553
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:12,480
The future is in cremation.

554
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,040
- Is he here?
- Not Bauchiero.

555
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:18,840
But Garrone is. "Zavattaro
Brothers, Inc. Marble Workers."

556
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,640
What's that have to do with it?

557
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,280
Why is there a company name?

558
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:27,120
The marble worker brought the client.
The architect is paid separately.

559
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,720
It was a great pain.

560
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:41,680
I can still see him in front of
this painting, poor, dear Garrone.

561
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:47,040
He left a great emptiness,
with his pleasantness.

562
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,240
Who had any interest in killing him?

563
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:53,440
I was about to ask the same question.

564
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:57,000
Nobody! Absolutely nobody.
Am I right?

565
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,720
He was there that evening too.

566
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:03,840
Did he tell you anything that
evening that could be useful to us?

567
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
No, nothing interesting.

568
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:12,120
One moment. I am getting
an illumination. Details emerge!

569
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,320
- The Piovano sisters were there.
- Yes, they were.

570
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,640
One of them said...

571
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,800
"Tonight we'll all go
to the flower shop."

572
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:26,920
Garrone said, "No,
tonight I'm dealing with stones".

573
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:31,200
He actually said,
"Tonight I'm dealing with stones".

574
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,760
At the time, nobody
understood what he meant.

575
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:39,560
Maybe there is a connection
with the crime weapon.

576
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,040
- It's a hypothesis.
- Certainly.

577
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,160
Then he said something else.

578
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:49,280
I opened his arm out and said,
"Soon I will be so rich

579
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:53,600
that I'll buy all this junk and
throw it in the toilet". Excuse me.

580
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:57,440
- Please. He didn't do it.
- He did nothing!

581
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:04,160
Mrs. Dosio,
what a pleasure to see you here!

582
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:08,280
- Do you know Mr. Santamaria?
- I met him today during lunch.

583
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:15,040
I found a person who saw the
murderer a half hour after the crime.

584
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,440
Are you interested?

585
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,720
Is anyone here?

586
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,000
Who are you?

587
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,120
Chief Santamaria.

588
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,680
- And his colleague Depalma.
- Does Mrs. Dosio send you?

589
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,080
Duty sends us!
Are you Countess Tabusso?

590
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,800
- My ass!
- She's not a countess!

591
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,320
You should come at night.

592
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:57,080
They leave their cars down there.

593
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:02,240
They come here to do disgusting
things. Not even Sodom and Gomorrah!

594
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:05,360
They come all the way down here.
We can hear their voices.

595
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:08,400
The city is advancing,
the sluts are advancing!

596
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:11,920
They ruined this paradise.
They screw everywhere!

597
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:15,280
- They go through a hole in the fence.
- Why don't you close it?

598
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:19,920
They make another one!
You like my jungle?

599
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:25,040
Stop! Don't step on the strawberries.
Want some? You fell?

600
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:28,240
Look at this nice
17th century wash basin.

601
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:31,280
I had to close the water.
They used it as a bidet!

602
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:35,160
Madam, we have to ask your sister
some questions.

603
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,120
- Because of the woman with a tube?
- Yes.

604
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:38,640
Come.

605
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:44,440
You go up, you've weak legs.
You go up too.

606
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:47,720
- Go on! Are you afraid?
- I'm getting on it.

607
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,320
Do you like my train?

608
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,080
I had it made for my poor
Cicci who became paralyzed.

609
00:45:56,200 --> 00:46:00,600
It was hard to take him up the
stairs. He weighed over 100 kilos!

610
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:04,880
My sister is afraid the blond
will return to take revenge.

611
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,440
That is why she hasn't talked
since then.

612
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:10,200
She doesn't leave the house anymore.

613
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:15,080
- Here she is.
- Good morning.

614
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:18,760
Can you tell us about the woman
with a purse with a star, madam?

615
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,640
- Miss!
- Excuse me.

616
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:23,400
She hadn't digest well
and couldn't sleep.

617
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:27,200
- Let her speak.
- No. She gets too emotional.

618
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:30,520
Anyway, I know the story by heart.

619
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:33,400
We had eaten Brussel sprouts.

620
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,720
You know what they are?

621
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,840
My sister got up and left.

622
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,400
- What time was it?
- Around 11:00.

623
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:46,720
She crossed the garden and went
towards the valley of sluts.

624
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:50,720
She is a romantic type.

625
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:53,280
Maybe she was listening
to the crickets.

626
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:58,880
Suddenly, the headlights of a car
about to leave, turned on.

627
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:04,080
There was a strange noise and that
ugly beast came out from the bushes.

628
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:10,000
She began chasing her, yelling
and threatening her with the tube.

629
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:13,120
- Did you see her face?
- She said she was a monster.

630
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:15,120
My sister ran away.

631
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:19,640
Then she read the paper
and realized she'd killed Garrone.

632
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,640
She got so scared
that she didn't speak anymore.

633
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:26,760
Her block went away when she spoke
to Mrs. Dosio at the hairdresser.

634
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:29,320
Everything is still printed
here for her.

635
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,600
A beach bag with a starfish on it.

636
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,520
A starfish?

637
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:37,080
Will you clean up the valley now?

638
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:42,680
Does it seem nice
that I must live among sluts?

639
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,760
Mr. Bauchiero, does this seem
like the star of Italy?

640
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,640
You're right. It's a starfish!

641
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,040
Right after the crime,
the blond was in "Le Buone Pere".

642
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:03,400
Where were Dosio and Campi?

643
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,920
The rich never have an alibi.

644
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:08,880
Maybe they were together...

645
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,640
- Why?
- Speak up.

646
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,200
Massimo Campi... is homosexual.

647
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,800
- I'm rushing off. Bye.
- See you.

648
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:33,720
No. They'll see us!

649
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
- Why do you always lock the car?
- You don't worry about thieves?

650
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,520
It's a 500!

651
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:43,440
Massimo, you despise me.
You think I'm an idiot, huh?

652
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:47,240
What are you saying?
You are an extraordinary young man!

653
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,520
- Really?
- Certainly.

654
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,800
- Swear it.
- I swear.

655
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:56,720
I am happy because my insecurity
is my worst aspect.

656
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:00,320
- Coming to dinner at my place?
- I don't know.

657
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:03,880
- My folks left. We'll be alone.
- Hurrah!

658
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:07,520
I'll go to Zavattaro tomorrow.
Look at how they park!

659
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:10,640
- Zavattaro?
- I'm doing an investigation.

660
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:14,760
- I've a trace...
- It's not your business.

661
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:18,880
- What? You're involved.
- Please, stop it.

662
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:23,840
Thank you so much!
Sorry if I worry about you!

663
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:27,040
- Enough!
- Massimo!

664
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,680
Excuse me. Massimo!

665
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,200
Let me explain.
There's been a misunderstanding!

666
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:49,040
- Massimo, forgive me.
- Don't do that!

667
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,200
- You are ridiculous!
- Massimo!

668
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,640
Carryouts save men without wives
and wives without domestic help.

669
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,760
The chart is updated until today.

670
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:04,920
Mr. Fontana, will you forgive me
if we won't eat very well?

671
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:08,280
Of course! The food isn't that good
in restaurants nowadays.

672
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:13,040
Like the other evening with
the Americans. Right, Vittorio?

673
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:16,760
He slipped away during the starters!

674
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:20,120
I don't care what Vittorio did
the other evening.

675
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:24,200
From what time to what time
did he leave?

676
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:27,560
My dear, Fontana is wrong.

677
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,840
He is not wrong!
You don't have an alibi either.

678
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,800
An alibi?

679
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:39,360
You were either with some slut
or you killed Garrone.

680
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:43,360
- What're you saying?
- The lady is joking.

681
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:46,720
I am not joking. Tell me something.

682
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,120
Of course!

683
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:53,440
A few months ago you told
Vittorio something a bit dirty

684
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:57,000
about an obscene object.

685
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:01,640
When I got closer
you immediately changed the subject.

686
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:05,520
But I think I heard you
say a name. Remember it?

687
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:09,120
- It was nonsense.
- Tell me, too.

688
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:15,480
Some Dutch executives,
who came to do business with us,

689
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:18,040
told me they had bought...

690
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,920
How can I say it...?

691
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:24,080
Some stone phallic figures

692
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:26,560
made by a marble worker from Emilia.

693
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:29,880
- What is his name?
- Zavattaro.

694
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:32,840
- It's what I wanted to know.
- That's all?

695
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,400
Yes. Enjoy your meal.

696
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,400
It may be chance, but...

697
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:38,480
Here's the villa of the two lunatics.

698
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:41,720
This is the Campi one.
It's a small world!

699
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,840
Mr. Santamaria, the phone for you.

700
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,280
The lady!

701
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:51,440
- Hello?
- This is Anna Carla Dosio.

702
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:54,200
- Good evening.
- Did you speak with Mrs. Tabusso?

703
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,880
- Yes. I thank you very much.
- Was she helpful?

704
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,040
We'll know this evening

705
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:02,360
when we'll do a roundup
in the lady's property.

706
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:05,480
Really? Good. I'm glad.

707
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,760
I've more news.
Maybe it's important.

708
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:12,360
What is it about?

709
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,600
No. The phone could be tapped.

710
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:17,920
- Yours?
- No, yours!

711
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,760
- Can you come here tomorrow?
- Certainly.

712
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,840
I'll expect you at 10:00.
Good luck.

713
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,800
Thank you. Good night.

714
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,760
- I said that because I have an idea.
- I know what idea!

715
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:33,880
- What?
- Nothing.

716
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:36,520
- I am ready. And you?
- Very ready!

717
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:40,280
Enough. I am already tipsy.

718
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:05,360
- What is it?
- I think...

719
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:09,520
Maybe we wouldn't argue anymore
if we could have a child.

720
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,080
I was kidding!

721
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:23,400
Want to go to the Balon market
on Saturday morning?

722
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:27,280
- We'll find something for the villa.
- No need, there's everything.

723
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:31,200
- In your room too.
- My room?

724
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,640
Yes. Why?

725
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,280
Separate bedrooms!

726
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:39,480
I just hope mine
isn't in the basement,

727
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,480
as is suited for someone
of my low level!

728
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:44,200
- Come on, Lello!
- Come to the castle, Cinderella.

729
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:46,920
But at midnight you'll turn
into a washerwoman again!

730
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:49,680
Enough! I can't stand you anymore.

731
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:53,840
I gave up women because they are
a nuisance. But you are worse!

732
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Then go back to your women!

733
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:05,560
Hello? Anna Carla!

734
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,120
How's it going?

735
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:10,320
I was in the garden. I ran...

736
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:14,280
A roundup in Tabusso's valley?

737
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,240
How do you know?

738
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:19,360
Excuse me a moment,
I'll be right back.

739
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,160
Everyone stop! Police!

740
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:34,040
- Let me get my clothes!
- It's just a roundup.

741
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:37,560
- No mercy!
- None at all!

742
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:43,240
- Got you!
- Don't touch me, pig!

743
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:46,400
- Pretend I am with you.
- Yes. Nicosia!

744
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:49,600
- Pretend she is with you.
- Come on, doll!

745
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:53,200
Let me go! I don't want to!
Let me go!

746
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:56,920
- I'll tell your wife!
- Obscene acts in public.

747
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:59,720
- This is a private place.
- Come with us.

748
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:03,880
- I'm a client. Is it forbidden?
- Here it is! This is my house!

749
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:05,440
It's a brothel!

750
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,320
Please, please...

751
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:10,760
Help the lady.

752
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:14,280
Please. Come, don't be afraid.
Why are you pulling?

753
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,160
Nicosia!
Block her on the other side.

754
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:22,120
Nicosia, Copiello,
block the villa entrances.

755
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:29,760
I had gotten five!
You left me alone. Where are you?

756
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:35,920
They are coming up!

757
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,120
Virginia!

758
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,840
Over there!

759
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:49,280
- Come with us.
- Can't you see I'm a lady?

760
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:51,560
Excuse me. You come with us!

761
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,320
Well?

762
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:58,080
A few women, one young man
and a... gentleman.

763
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:05,240
Mr. Depalma, where are you?

764
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:09,640
Please, you answer. I can't shout.

765
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,800
Nicosia, what is it? We are here.

766
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:16,520
I found the following evidence.

767
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:27,840
Keep calm. I'll come alone.
Don't worry.

768
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:35,440
The weather forecast said,
"cool winds arriving from the north."

769
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:38,120
They must have stopped them
at customs!

770
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,760
At 4 in the morning
I've a sense of humor!

771
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:45,320
- What is your name?
- Fascetti Ermelinda.

772
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:48,840
- Must I get close to the mirror?
- No, that's fine.

773
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,920
- You go work there every night.
- It's not a question.

774
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:55,880
If you answer,
it becomes a question. Come on!

775
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:59,760
It is a fake mirror.
They can't see you.

776
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:03,720
- Is it her?
- Take a good look. Recognize her?

777
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:07,880
No, it's not her. The other woman
was... I can't explain it.

778
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:10,800
She was taller.

779
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:16,360
I don't match that woman's traits.
I'm not tall or blond.

780
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,800
Who told you who we're looking for?

781
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:22,480
The town is small and people murmur.
May I go?

782
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,240
- Yes.
- Go.

783
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:26,560
- You can go...
- Fuck off!

784
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:30,440
Don't be funny!

785
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:34,840
This one is tall but not blond.

786
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:39,040
She could be wearing a wig.
Should I tell you that?

787
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:41,280
No, madam, you should not.

788
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:44,440
- Next!
- Give it to me.

789
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:49,240
Who knows a tall, blond woman
who has these things?

790
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:56,360
Exact answer!

791
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,880
Can we go fuck off too?

792
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:01,040
- Please, miss.
- Thank you.

793
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:03,320
- The same to you.
- Thank you, madam.

794
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:06,720
We know who caused this great
night for us.

795
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:10,840
Those two old witches! Could you
tell them to fuck off, for me?

796
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
- I certainly will.
- Thank you.

797
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:18,080
- Hear that? You must defend us.
- We will take measures.

798
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:21,440
Hello? Excellency!

799
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:26,280
The boss called to know
about the roundup.

800
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:29,240
Did you tell him
the place of the finding

801
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:33,360
is near Massimo Campi's home?
- Yes. He hung up furiously.

802
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:37,320
At times I think I made
a mistake in being a policeman.

803
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:40,080
Sirs! A turn of events!

804
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:43,440
You are right.
I wanted to be a tenor.

805
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:47,200
Especially at dawn, so many
thoughts go through one's mind.

806
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:49,640
At dawn you bust your balls too.

807
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:54,040
We can shout out for victory.
Look.

808
00:58:54,160 --> 00:59:00,200
It's the homosexual
I talked about in the phone call

809
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:03,080
after the stakeout I did yesterday.

810
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:06,480
Like that! They stopped him
on the site of the roundup.

811
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:08,600
He didn't have his ID.

812
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:11,800
That raincoat fits him perfectly.

813
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:14,440
- Almost.
- I don't have my ID

814
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:17,400
because I forgot my bag
at a friend's house.

815
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:20,920
I don't know what they had me
wear this raincoat.

816
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:23,720
- Take it off.
- Thank you.

817
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:26,480
Where does this friend live?

818
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:29,240
Answer!

819
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:32,800
- Well?
- In the hills.

820
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:34,560
What is his name?

821
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:38,400
You don't want to tell us?

822
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:42,320
I don't want to involve him.

823
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:44,480
He is a high class person.

824
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:48,680
- Get his data and let him go.
- Let him go?

825
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:52,240
I always lose my bag!

826
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:41,440
- Chief!
- Good morning. Already at work!

827
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:44,400
I got up early
because I had a sleepless night.

828
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:47,160
- Too many thoughts?
- The heat.

829
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:51,480
One should leave the city.
My gardener has already done so.

830
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:56,680
- Are you here by chance?
- Of course not!

831
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:01,640
Did the roundup go well?

832
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:06,000
- How did you find out?
- Anna Carla told me.

833
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,480
One of her informers told her.

834
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:12,360
A new character
in your theater work?

835
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:15,920
I must have said something wrong.

836
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:19,840
Do you also know the results
of the roundup?

837
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,800
Why should I?

838
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:26,600
Seven prostitutes, three pimps,
one young man named Lello Riviera.

839
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:36,120
- Why do you tell me?
- Try to guess!

840
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:41,640
The exquisite tact of our policemen!

841
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:45,600
- Last night he was here with you.
- The tact has been abandoned!

842
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:50,920
Didn't Mr. Riviera already tell you?

843
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:55,480
There was no declaration.
He is a very reserved person.

844
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:57,280
A real gentleman!

845
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:02,880
If he didn't tell you,
how do you know we are friends?

846
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:05,040
- Why do you get angry?
- How did you find out?

847
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:07,560
- Did Mrs. Dosio tell you?
- She has nothing to do with it!

848
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:10,520
- Now you are getting angry.
- A man has been killed!

849
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:12,680
Because of a misunderstanding,
you suspect me.

850
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:14,640
I must investigate.

851
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:18,600
The sadistic mechanism of prying
into one's past is triggered!

852
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:23,440
- You scream too much.
- Then you scream too!

853
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:25,200
Thank you, I don't need it.

854
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:32,120
Go to Mrs. Dosio.
She doesn't like to wait.

855
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:38,400
Tell me why Mr. Riviera
went away from here last night

856
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:40,520
during the roundup.

857
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:43,080
It's simple, chief.

858
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:47,400
He must have gone
to one of those sluts.

859
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:49,920
Or is it forbidden
by the Constitution?

860
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:53,120
By his constitution!

861
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:02,680
I'll speak clearly at the reunion
with the regional branches.

862
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
We must go from nine to five.

863
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:11,760
Certainly... Certainly!

864
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:14,720
We knew that.
We already told them.

865
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,640
Come to your room.
Don't bother Daddy.

866
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:31,480
I am at your disposal.
Right on time!

867
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:35,240
We only arrive late
when we have to catch robbers!

868
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:55,520
Where are we going?

869
01:03:57,080 --> 01:04:00,280
Look in my purse.
There is a yellow card.

870
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:05,880
I told you there's an address.

871
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:08,640
Why did you tell Massimo Campi
about the roundup?

872
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:12,200
That is why you're so angry!

873
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,800
Massimo is a gossiper!

874
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:17,920
I told him to show him
he doesn't always know everything.

875
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:21,800
You are right.

876
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:23,320
Will you forgive me?

877
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:37,480
"Zavattaro Brothers,
marble, stone, granite,

878
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:40,320
artistic works,
funeral monuments."

879
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:57,840
More stones!

880
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,880
One witness says that the evening
of the murder, Garrone said,

881
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:02,920
"Tonight I will deal with stones."

882
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:05,080
Madam, why are we here?

883
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:09,080
Yesterday I found out where some
Dutch people bought those things...

884
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:10,760
I see!

885
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:14,440
I smell murderers!

886
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:17,400
- You have a gun?
- Let's be serious.

887
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:23,440
Is anyone here?

888
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:26,760
I won't say who I am.
Don't be surprised at what I'll say.

889
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:29,120
Don't you be surprised either.

890
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:43,040
- Good morning.
- Are you the owner?

891
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:45,760
- Mr. Zavattaro?
- Yes.

892
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:50,520
We come from Holland.
You make particular objects.

893
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:52,400
What articles interest you?

894
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,400
Special objects...

895
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,800
Is it possible to see
these special objects?

896
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:07,040
I'll call my brother. He worked
in Germany and speaks German.

897
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:08,800
There's no need, I am Italian.

898
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:13,080
Then why are you letting
the woman speak?

899
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,160
She wants to exercise.

900
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:21,120
This is the Fantasy Pavilion.

901
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:32,480
My brother Osvaldo is an artist.

902
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:36,040
- Do you have a sales network?
- No.

903
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:38,160
From the producer to the consumer.

904
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:41,720
This is the classic format.

905
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:50,760
Osvaldo tried to make them
in a smaller format,

906
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:54,520
but they weren't appreciated.

907
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:58,480
These look good anywhere.

908
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:03,080
Here we have the big format.

909
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:12,600
In Sweden, they put them
on the front lawns of homes.

910
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:17,120
If you're private buyers, and want
one or two, there's a certain price.

911
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:20,640
If you are a group
and have our product circulate,

912
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:23,760
we can give percentages
and offer discounts.

913
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:27,120
- Are you an interpreter?
- No, I'm a lawyer.

914
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:30,480
I represent
architect Garrone's family.

915
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:33,920
The Garrone family?

916
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:37,880
Is this architect Garrone's friend?

917
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:39,680
No, she's a relative.

918
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:43,800
Did you know that Garrone
was killed Tuesday night?

919
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:45,680
We don't care!

920
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:49,840
We want information on the credit
Garrone had with your company.

921
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:54,200
Credit? The work and capital
are mine!

922
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:58,720
He received a percentage
when he sold the articles.

923
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:03,600
20 percent. But in one year
he only sold 20.

924
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:07,400
There is no credit! Understand?

925
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:12,440
There isn't credit for anyone.
Now get out, you and this slut!

926
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,320
I hadn't understood
the last word well.

927
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:20,680
You are not an attorney.

928
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:22,840
- He's a gorilla.
- Come.

929
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:26,800
- No, a policeman.
- I think he's a gorilla.

930
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:41,000
- Are they the murderers?
- No.

931
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:44,720
They wouldn't have left that thing
at Garrone's,

932
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:46,720
considering they make them.

933
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:50,080
Now we know the weapon
belonged to the victim.

934
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:52,600
Killed by his own samples!

935
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:58,760
Leave me at a taxi station.
You must return to your family.

936
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:02,440
My family is scattered.
My little one eats at school.

937
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:05,760
My husband has lunch
in the office.

938
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:10,920
Then if you allow me,
I'd like to invite you to lunch.

939
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:14,520
I know of a place on the hill.

940
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,240
It's discreet and looks like
a country house. Alright?

941
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:20,760
It's fine! Certainly.

942
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:23,560
- It's cool up there.
- Very well!

943
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:28,160
- Out!
- Are you crazy? I'll report you!

944
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:30,880
- I'll bust your back.
- Help!

945
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:35,640
I don't know any surveyors,
or architect Garrone!

946
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:38,720
- I don't know anyone!
- Leave me alone!

947
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:42,280
- How dare you?
- Dirty spy!

948
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:44,640
That slut wasn't enough!

949
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,400
Who are you? Another relative?

950
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:49,600
You have broken 18 dicks!

951
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:54,480
I'll kill you, all gorillas, all
policemen and all the Dutch!

952
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:07,800
Today is closing day!

953
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:10,360
I have never been here.

954
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:23,040
Maybe..

955
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:27,000
- Maybe?
- I was saying...

956
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:30,160
maybe it's nicer like this,
without anyone.

957
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:33,680
The poetry of beaches without
bathers, classrooms without students.

958
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:37,040
And rooms for illicit couples
without customers.

959
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:39,400
Excuse me.

960
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:44,480
Who knows how many wavering alibis
would find an explanation here.

961
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:48,080
There is a void in my husband's
alibi. Did you know that?

962
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:49,640
Yes, I know.

963
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,400
You know that I do.
From 8:15 onwards.

964
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:56,600
There is a void in every alibi

965
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:59,720
that my husband makes up
to spend his evenings out.

966
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:02,840
It happens almost every evening.

967
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:06,600
There's also a void
in Massimo Campi's alibi.

968
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:10,520
If he were the murderer,
he'd have said it.

969
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:15,280
You don't know Massimo well.
Make a bigger effort.

970
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:17,920
Why are you laughing?

971
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:24,000
A bigger effort isn't required
when the suspect is a poor devil.

972
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Massimo is neurotic,
but he is also very humble,

973
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:32,800
generous, sincere
and very intelligent.

974
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:37,000
Don't you and Massimo get tired
of having to be so intelligent?

975
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:38,920
It must be tiring!

976
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:42,240
- A fatigue that you avoid.
- Yes.

977
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:47,680
Intelligence just to pass the time
is... bullshit.

978
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:50,160
Bullshit?

979
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:53,800
Let's speak clearly.

980
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:57,760
- Cute!
- You began offending.

981
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:03,480
- Will you forgive me?
- What are you doing tomorrow?

982
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:06,080
My husband is taking
our daughter to Geneva.

983
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:09,040
With all the kidnappings
there have been lately,

984
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:13,000
she will be safer in Switzerland.
It's like putting her in a bank!

985
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:15,440
Why do you ask?

986
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:17,760
To avoid finding
another closed restaurant.

987
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:20,520
My house is open,
but I am a terrible cook.

988
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:24,040
- Was I inviting?
- No. I am inviting!

989
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:26,920
- Do you like filet?
- With pepper.

990
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:29,520
I'll buy pepper. Well?

991
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:36,360
Well then...
you take care of the filet.

992
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:39,440
I'll take care of the cream,
the pepper and the rest.

993
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:49,040
- It's...
- Who?

994
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:55,000
- Do you know him too?
- Yes. He's my husband's good friend.

995
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:56,840
It's closed.

996
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:00,760
She is certainly not his wife!

997
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:06,600
- Why are you hiding?
- To avoid embarrassing him.

998
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:08,600
I am on duty.

999
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:17,640
- Where were we?
- Weren't you on duty?

1000
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:31,120
The Zavattaro lead was wrong.
Let's try this one.

1001
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:33,120
You are stubborn!

1002
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:36,480
My respects to the illustrious
loafers of the Constraints Office.

1003
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:41,800
We have with us our colleague
Riviera of the fourth department.

1004
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:45,920
- He needs your help.
- I'd like to know if there is here,

1005
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:50,080
waiting for approval,
a project by architect Garrone.

1006
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:52,800
- We can look.
- Thank you.

1007
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:56,200
- On what date was it presented?
- I don't know.

1008
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:03,800
- I don't even know if it exists.
- He's trying to be a detective.

1009
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:08,080
Yes, Excellency, certainly.

1010
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:12,240
With all the kidnappings
and shootings around,

1011
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:17,400
must we take care of this?
Yes, Excellency.

1012
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:20,360
- Well?
- The boss is even angrier.

1013
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:22,680
- It's not our fault.
- Why?

1014
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:25,320
Forced to withdrawal symptoms
because the restaurant is closed.

1015
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:28,520
He had no first course
or second course!

1016
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:30,640
What did you find?

1017
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:33,760
I questioned the Zavattaros
who have an alibi.

1018
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:37,920
They say a young, thin
and delicate man went to them

1019
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:40,080
asking questions about Garrone.

1020
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:41,640
Lello Riviera.

1021
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:46,320
I will take care of Lello Riviera.
You order another coffee.

1022
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:21,200
- There he is!
- It must be a policeman.

1023
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:25,520
- It doesn't seem like it.
- He's suspicious looking.

1024
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:37,480
This is the washerwomen's basin.

1025
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:41,600
For centuries, in the Po River
people of Turin washed their clothes.

1026
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:44,080
This area was always full
of good pears.

1027
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:47,400
Sit down, or leave.
You are disturbing.

1028
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:52,160
Good-day, Chief. I'm glad
you're interested in our debates.

1029
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:54,320
Sit down, please.

1030
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:59,400
Po, the father of all Italian
rivers, and maybe of the world.

1031
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:04,000
The etymology of its name
goes beyond the Mediterranean.

1032
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:07,120
The Greeks called the river
"Potamos".

1033
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:11,880
The Indians called "Potomac"
the river that crosses Carolina.

1034
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:14,240
- Virginia!
- Yes, in Virginia.

1035
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:17,400
Now we see...
No, that is our friend,

1036
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:20,920
an archeologist consultant
who cooperated on this docu,

1037
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:24,080
architect Garrone, who
unfortunately ended up badly.

1038
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:27,440
And this ends our screening
on historical basins

1039
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:30,200
in the Turin countryside.
Good evening.

1040
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:34,880
Why did you go to the Zavattaros
asking for information on Garrone?

1041
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:38,040
- He hit me! Can I report him?
- Yes.

1042
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:41,000
- Why did you go?
- I'd prefer not answering.

1043
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:45,120
We can obtain a warrant. That
way you'll answer to the judge.

1044
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:47,640
If you think you can intimidate me,
you are wrong.

1045
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:52,560
Why didn't you tell me

1046
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:55,240
that on that evening you were
in Massimo Campi's home?

1047
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:58,360
- How did you find out?
- He told me.

1048
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:02,120
Really?
Did he admit it spontaneously?

1049
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:04,240
- Wasn't he ashamed?
- Answer!

1050
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Is Mr. Massimo Campi
a big suspect?

1051
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:16,400
If you told me Mr. Campi
isn't a suspect,

1052
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:18,360
I would be disappointed.

1053
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:22,320
Not because I have ill feelings
towards him... maybe a bit...

1054
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:24,440
but most of all because...

1055
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,800
He acts very arrogantly with me.

1056
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:30,760
So?

1057
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:35,680
I try not oppressing him
because I know love isn't a chain.

1058
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:40,600
Despite that, we have broken up.

1059
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:45,000
It's terrible. I can't live anymore.

1060
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:49,760
The last hope of having
him back...

1061
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:55,000
It's better to say,
"to have him consider me again"...

1062
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:58,160
It's to be able to show him

1063
01:17:58,280 --> 01:18:03,520
that I'm capable of getting him out
of trouble and helping the police.

1064
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:07,280
I want to hear him say,
"You were wonderful. Thank you".

1065
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,800
Just that.

1066
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:19,440
- Are you from the south?
- Yes. Try to be strong.

1067
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:32,400
When you dressed me
as a woman last night,

1068
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:36,920
you were very kind to me.
Southerners have a good heart.

1069
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:41,320
- And then?
- Well...

1070
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,440
At first I suspected
surveyor Bauchiero

1071
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:48,400
because I thought
he was Garrone's rival.

1072
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:51,040
But I was on the wrong track.

1073
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:56,040
I looked in the real estate
office of Town Hall and found...

1074
01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:59,920
Enough! Be content with knowing
I am on the right track.

1075
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:03,880
- Meaning?
- You must trust me.

1076
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:08,640
I'm waiting for a phone call
for a meeting tomorrow morning

1077
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:10,760
which I think will be definitive
and solve things.

1078
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:13,880
- With who?
- I can't tell you.

1079
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:17,400
But tomorrow, after speaking
to a certain person,

1080
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:20,160
I'll run to you,
and you will thank me!

1081
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:23,280
Riviera! Be careful.

1082
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:26,600
- Don't worry.
- A Sicilian colleague of mine says,

1083
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:30,360
"Who looks for what he shouldn't
finds what he doesn't want."

1084
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:32,320
There is a suited proverb here too.

1085
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:35,160
"The bad washerwoman
never finds a good pear."

1086
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:37,680
I already found it! Goodbye.

1087
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:48,000
Follow him from tomorrow on,
see where he goes and who he sees.

1088
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:50,920
They'll think I'm a fag!

1089
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:52,880
They already think that of me.

1090
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Great way of parking!

1091
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:12,240
Good thing I watch my weight!

1092
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,040
What does he want?

1093
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:46,200
Who? Oh, Riviera!

1094
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:49,720
No, Mr. Santamaria isn't here.
You can talk to me.

1095
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:52,080
A car followed you?

1096
01:23:52,840 --> 01:23:55,280
No, we didn't have you followed.

1097
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:59,400
We don't have white cars
with a dented bumper.

1098
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:03,760
- Why didn't you open the door?
- I was afraid!

1099
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:07,200
First Zavattaro hit me,
and now I am hunted down.

1100
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:10,400
Maybe it's still him.
I am working for you!

1101
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:13,200
- Very kind of you. Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1102
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:15,520
You must find out
who that car belongs to.

1103
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:18,280
Alright. We'll do that.

1104
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:25,680
Who does a white Fiat 1500 with
a left dented bumper, belong to?

1105
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:31,240
You don't know? Are you sleeping?
What've you got there?

1106
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:35,360
We went to over 100 places between
stores, boutiques and supermarkets.

1107
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:37,920
Nobody has ever seen
a purse like this.

1108
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:41,480
The police is asking for help.
Its hands are tied.

1109
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:45,040
It can't shoot.
It never finds a shitty thing!

1110
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:11,240
Look at what a lovely painting,
Mr. Vollero.

1111
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:14,360
Don't use my name!
I tell you all the time, idiot!

1112
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:32,520
I don't buy here, I buy in London!

1113
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:36,800
- Who can we attribute it to?
- Whoever you think.

1114
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:47,200
Do you have... ?

1115
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:50,760
A record by...

1116
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:03,240
Learn English! Southerner!

1117
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,880
- Does this grind pepper too?
- It grinds everything.

1118
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:15,240
Today it's the fashion
to grind pepper.

1119
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:18,560
- How much does it cost?
- 5,000. It's a deal!

1120
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:21,320
- This one?
- 6,000.

1121
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:26,440
- I'll take it.
- You're making a good deal.

1122
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:39,640
- Thank you.
- What is it?

1123
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:42,240
An object for a gift.

1124
01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:45,720
- Nice.
- What is this?

1125
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:47,840
An object for a gift.

1126
01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:19,760
It was made in Faenza
in the 18th century. A unique piece.

1127
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:22,120
I need two of them.

1128
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:27,240
We have two unique pieces.
Fixed price 40,000, negotiable.

1129
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:41,600
Excuse me, sir.
I accidently took both of them.

1130
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:43,680
I don't know where my head is.

1131
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:47,440
Did you get the pestle too?

1132
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:49,560
- What pestle?
- Yeah, sure.

1133
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:54,640
A long bronze pestle
worth 10,000 Lira.

1134
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:04,080
- Good morning.
- Good morning, madam.

1135
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:06,200
You're here too! Why?

1136
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:10,320
I've an appointment with a person
at the cemetery of used furniture.

1137
01:28:10,440 --> 01:28:13,120
Today everyone is here.

1138
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:16,840
Bonetto, my husband, me, you,
Massimo...

1139
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,240
Did you see Massimo?

1140
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:22,800
- I thought...
- I haven't an appointment with him.

1141
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:26,200
I prefer not meeting him.
It is too early.

1142
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:31,160
But I can tell you.
I think I know who killed Garrone.

1143
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:34,440
I will soon have confirmation.
Goodbye.

1144
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:36,200
Goodbye, Rivera.

1145
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:38,760
Riviera!

1146
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:45,440
Mr. Santamaria, it seems the
young man knows important things.

1147
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:50,200
Yes. At Balon,
the used items market.

1148
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:54,520
I signal the presence
of Mrs. Dosio and her husband,

1149
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:56,760
of Mr. Carpi and others.

1150
01:28:56,880 --> 01:28:58,880
Don't lose sight of him.
I'll be right there.

1151
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:21,600
- I knew you were here too!
- What do you mean?

1152
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:25,760
- I just ran into Lello.
- I didn't see him.

1153
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:29,520
I came to look for something
for the Monferrato villa.

1154
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:32,800
But prices here are as high
as downtown antique dealers.

1155
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:36,160
He has an appointment
at the furniture cemetery.

1156
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:40,280
He seems to be mad.
He said he knows who killed Garrone,

1157
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:44,040
and soon will have confirmation.
What's this all about?

1158
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,040
What did Chief Santamaria find out?

1159
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:49,040
Why do you ask me?

1160
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:51,560
- Did I make a blunder?
- I don't see...

1161
01:29:51,680 --> 01:29:53,680
Today....

1162
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:56,880
- I must go. I'll call you tomorrow.
- Bye.

1163
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:23,800
This isn't something typical.
Forget it.

1164
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:10,600
- Are you tired?
- No. I can't find Bonetto.

1165
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:12,360
What a tragedy!

1166
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:46,480
- Where were you?
- I was looking around.

1167
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:52,680
- Did something happen?
- I don't know. Let's go see.

1168
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:12,640
Where were you?

1169
01:33:15,240 --> 01:33:16,840
You are a shit...

1170
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:19,680
And so is he!

1171
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:40,760
- Massimo!
- Stay back.

1172
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:51,920
Lello Riviera.

1173
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:54,760
They bashed his head in.

1174
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:57,320
- With a bronze pestle.
- How do you know?

1175
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:07,880
Let's go. Nicosia, advise Depalma.

1176
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:10,440
Mr. Vollero. Don't hide.

1177
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:14,840
- Come with us.
- Make way! Make way!

1178
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:19,640
I don't owe anyone an explanation!
I won't answer any question

1179
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:23,600
if I'm not explained the reason,
and not without my lawyer.

1180
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:26,160
None of you are accused,
for the time being.

1181
01:34:26,280 --> 01:34:28,360
This is not a questioning.

1182
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:31,480
It's a request for information
for the D.A. office.

1183
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:35,560
Is that why you keep us here,
guarded, in a basement?

1184
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:37,680
We don't have living rooms!

1185
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:42,440
Each of you should tell me
why this morning he went to Balon

1186
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:45,560
and where he was exactly at 12:35,

1187
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:48,640
when Mr. Lello Riviera
was killed.

1188
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:52,080
- Bonetto, don't answer!
- Why not?

1189
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:54,400
I have nothing to hide.

1190
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:57,680
- Why should I answer first?
- You're the first in line.

1191
01:34:57,800 --> 01:35:00,640
If they start from there,
I'm the last and you're the first.

1192
01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:04,600
Let's begin with the ladies.
Would you like to answer first?

1193
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:08,720
- I was there to buy something.
- What?

1194
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:11,840
No! Not a bronze pestle.

1195
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:17,120
A pepper grinder. Is it forbidden?

1196
01:35:17,240 --> 01:35:21,240
You went all the way there
to buy a pepper grinder?

1197
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:26,800
The lady knew Riviera well,
and also Garrone.

1198
01:35:26,920 --> 01:35:30,720
Be careful!
Don't you dare insinuate anything!

1199
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:34,480
The only person who could be
there to meet Riviera

1200
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:37,640
is Mr. Campi.
And everyone knows why!

1201
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:41,080
Be quiet, imbecile!
I had no appointment with him.

1202
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:44,600
I didn't know he was there.
Anna Carla, speak, by God!

1203
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:47,440
You wrote in that letter
to eliminate Garrone!

1204
01:35:47,560 --> 01:35:49,760
You were the last to talk to Lello.

1205
01:35:49,880 --> 01:35:53,320
You knew where he was going and
that he was killed by a pestle!

1206
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:54,520
What do you mean?

1207
01:35:54,640 --> 01:35:56,720
Naturally the chief
won't question you!

1208
01:35:56,840 --> 01:36:00,280
- Aren't you ashamed?
- I demand an explanation. Anna Carla!

1209
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:02,600
Mr. Santamaria, can you come?

1210
01:36:08,240 --> 01:36:12,640
Get all their data
and send them back home.

1211
01:36:12,760 --> 01:36:15,760
They are all suspected,
more or less.

1212
01:36:15,880 --> 01:36:19,520
- Whoever is less, maybe is more!
- Is this a puzzle?

1213
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:22,640
Too many suspects, no culprit!
It is an ancient rule.

1214
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:25,080
I can read the titles in the paper.

1215
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:28,440
"Big names involved
in the Balon crime."

1216
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:31,560
I'll be considered the puppet
of the northern industrialists.

1217
01:36:31,680 --> 01:36:34,480
I already see you as
a vile and corrupted executive,

1218
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:37,000
bent over by the will
of the Right Christian Democrats.

1219
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:39,680
And to think your name
is Santamaria!

1220
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:44,080
Send them home. I'm your
superior, and it's an order.

1221
01:36:44,200 --> 01:36:47,480
You're the investigator.
I don't want to interfere.

1222
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:50,320
Remember what I said.
No, I didn't say anything.

1223
01:36:50,440 --> 01:36:52,440
We didn't see each other. Goodbye!

1224
01:36:56,080 --> 01:37:00,480
Chief, they all three
could be suspected. Murderers!

1225
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:03,600
- Sit down, please.
- How dare you?

1226
01:37:03,720 --> 01:37:08,720
He could be suspected too.
I heard him in front of witnesses

1227
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:13,080
say that Garrone was to be killed.

1228
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:17,360
- Please, sit down.
- Garrone was your enemy.

1229
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:22,520
No. He cooperated with me
on the stone basins investigation.

1230
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:29,080
Silence! Damn it!

1231
01:37:35,120 --> 01:37:38,520
Mr. Bonetto, earlier you spoke
about stone basins.

1232
01:37:38,640 --> 01:37:40,640
- Yes. Why?
- Okay.

1233
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:44,320
You who are from Piedmont
can help me solve a problem.

1234
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:49,000
Why doesn't the bad washerwoman
find a good "pear"?

1235
01:37:49,240 --> 01:37:51,240
What's the washerwoman
have to do with a pear?

1236
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:53,680
In the Turin dialect,
"pera", a pear, means "stone".

1237
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:54,840
That's it!

1238
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,880
The bad washerwoman
doesn't find a good stone

1239
01:37:58,040 --> 01:38:03,040
because she has no intention
of doing the washing!

1240
01:38:03,160 --> 01:38:06,560
- In English one would say...
- We don't give a darn!

1241
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:09,280
- Mr. Bonetto...
- Yes?

1242
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:13,880
That evening Garrone said, "This
evening I'm dealing with stones".

1243
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:17,240
Last night Lello Riviera
came to your screening

1244
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:20,520
because he is interested in stones.
- Of course...

1245
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:24,480
Then we'll go deal with stones.
We'll be right back.

1246
01:38:24,600 --> 01:38:26,240
- Let's go.
- Where?

1247
01:38:26,360 --> 01:38:28,120
- Didn't you understand?
- No.

1248
01:38:28,240 --> 01:38:30,240
These people are our guests.

1249
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,600
- I told you we were too many!
- Let me speak.

1250
01:38:51,880 --> 01:38:54,720
Are you accountant Cerioni
Giancarlo of the 4th division?

1251
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:58,280
- Yes. Why?
- You must return to the city.

1252
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:01,400
- Your mother is ill.
- I am here!

1253
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:04,200
- It's true!
- You must return to Town Hall.

1254
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:11,000
- Come on! We're going!
- What happened?

1255
01:39:11,120 --> 01:39:13,920
- I'll explain later.
- Let's go!

1256
01:39:20,680 --> 01:39:21,720
I found it.

1257
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:24,840
You see what the tube
in the blond woman's hand was?

1258
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:28,040
A lots division project.
Let's go see this Regis.

1259
01:39:34,520 --> 01:39:37,920
What are you doing?
I forbid you...

1260
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:40,480
What a lovely view, Mr. Regis!

1261
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:43,800
Leave that telescope alone.
I won't allow you to...

1262
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:45,920
Come. Look.

1263
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
Where are you going?
Come here.

1264
01:39:53,120 --> 01:39:56,120
That's why you and Garrone
were friends!

1265
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:58,240
My only real friend!

1266
01:39:58,360 --> 01:40:02,360
It's not easy when
one loves beauty, like us.

1267
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:06,280
There is strong prejudice
against voyeurism.

1268
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:08,080
- Peeping Toms.
- Oh!

1269
01:40:08,200 --> 01:40:10,840
It's dangerous to spy on couples
at night.

1270
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:15,000
- To the station!
- No, please!

1271
01:40:15,120 --> 01:40:17,520
Don't take me with you.
The neighbors...

1272
01:40:17,640 --> 01:40:21,480
If you speak here, you'll avoid
a bad impression, and worse.

1273
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:26,040
Right. We'll be understanding.
Let's get back to Garrone.

1274
01:40:26,600 --> 01:40:30,800
I swear I helped Garrone
without any interest.

1275
01:40:31,120 --> 01:40:35,240
I work at Town Hall's Constraints
Office. I stamp authorization.

1276
01:40:35,360 --> 01:40:39,640
He was looking for revenge
to pay back many humiliations.

1277
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:43,800
While working on a
documentary, he had found out

1278
01:40:44,120 --> 01:40:46,720
that on a land for future lots,

1279
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:50,080
there were the remains
of an antique washing basin.

1280
01:40:50,200 --> 01:40:53,240
The project could be blocked.

1281
01:41:00,400 --> 01:41:03,600
- Who is it?
- Chief Santamaria.

1282
01:41:03,720 --> 01:41:08,160
- And his colleague, Depalma.
- Get in front of the peep-hole.

1283
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Your profile, too.

1284
01:41:14,120 --> 01:41:15,720
Alright.

1285
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:24,560
It's nice here
at the "Le Buone Pere".

1286
01:41:24,680 --> 01:41:26,800
In dialect it means
"the good stones".

1287
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:30,160
Yes, the stones
of the old washing basin.

1288
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:33,800
- Your sister isn't here?
- No. She went...

1289
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:35,400
To Balon.

1290
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:38,360
No. The cemetery
for the 22 anniversary.

1291
01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:40,480
May I offer you something?

1292
01:41:42,200 --> 01:41:44,600
The 22nd anniversary of what?

1293
01:41:45,480 --> 01:41:51,320
The anniversary of the death
of her poor husband, Cicci.

1294
01:42:05,080 --> 01:42:08,080
After our intervention,
things are peaceful here, right?

1295
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:12,200
Yes... No! Unfortunately,
yesterday I had such a fright.

1296
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:15,920
I was in the garden
and down there I saw...

1297
01:42:16,080 --> 01:42:21,080
a young man who looked
very suspicious.

1298
01:42:21,200 --> 01:42:25,800
Then my sister talked to him
and found out he was your officer.

1299
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:28,000
- Was he blond and thin?
- Yes.

1300
01:42:28,120 --> 01:42:29,920
He didn't look like a police officer.

1301
01:42:30,080 --> 01:42:32,560
He wasn't.

1302
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:37,000
- Good-day, madam.
- Good-day.

1303
01:42:39,880 --> 01:42:41,480
What do you want?

1304
01:42:41,880 --> 01:42:44,160
We must ask you a few questions.

1305
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:52,040
Go help Palmira shell peas.

1306
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:57,400
- I offered a liquor to the gentlemen.
- Good.

1307
01:42:57,520 --> 01:43:01,520
Go shell peas, miss.
That would be better.

1308
01:43:01,640 --> 01:43:04,840
Mrs. Tabusso, shall we have a chat?

1309
01:43:06,160 --> 01:43:11,000
Did you know that Mr. Riviera
was killed today at Balon?

1310
01:43:13,320 --> 01:43:17,640
Yes, you know. We have evidence.

1311
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:21,760
What evidence do you mean?

1312
01:43:21,880 --> 01:43:24,200
We know that today
you were at Balon

1313
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:26,840
before going to the cemetery...
if you ever went there!

1314
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:30,400
I went. At least 10 people saw me.

1315
01:43:30,520 --> 01:43:32,640
But they saw you at Balon too.

1316
01:43:32,760 --> 01:43:35,880
An urban policeman.
Depalma, the envelope.

1317
01:43:36,040 --> 01:43:40,040
A fine, with time, license...

1318
01:43:40,160 --> 01:43:42,560
Is it forbidden
to go to the Balon?

1319
01:43:42,680 --> 01:43:45,120
It depends on the reason for going.

1320
01:43:46,440 --> 01:43:47,840
Madam...

1321
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,400
Will you show me your license?

1322
01:43:52,240 --> 01:43:55,080
- She doesn't have a license.
- No, she's without a purse.

1323
01:43:55,400 --> 01:43:57,400
Did you forget it in the car?

1324
01:43:57,520 --> 01:44:00,880
It must be the Fiat 1500 with
a dented bumper. I'll go see.

1325
01:44:01,040 --> 01:44:04,000
- No! I'll go.
- Don't bother, madam.

1326
01:44:20,120 --> 01:44:22,120
Dear madam...

1327
01:44:24,280 --> 01:44:26,400
I see you brought the money.

1328
01:44:29,640 --> 01:44:31,000
Very good.

1329
01:44:31,400 --> 01:44:34,120
But unfortunately,
there is an inconvenience.

1330
01:44:34,240 --> 01:44:36,400
The amount isn't enough anymore.

1331
01:44:36,520 --> 01:44:39,560
My friends at Town Hall
doubled the request.

1332
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:42,800
It was hard to remove the
constraint from the antique basin

1333
01:44:42,920 --> 01:44:44,920
on the land where lots are
to be made.

1334
01:44:45,080 --> 01:44:47,640
But you will earn
enormous amounts.

1335
01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:52,600
If you want your license,
you'll have to pay double.

1336
01:44:52,720 --> 01:44:56,840
Do you want to see the approved
project? Here it is.

1337
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:00,200
But first you must give me
the money. Look but don't touch.

1338
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:16,240
- Is it there?
- It's here!

1339
01:45:18,200 --> 01:45:20,800
Yes. She still had
the pestle in her purse.

1340
01:45:21,360 --> 01:45:23,760
Lello had caught on to her.

1341
01:45:23,880 --> 01:45:27,680
He had realized it.
Town Hall, the projects...

1342
01:45:28,040 --> 01:45:32,040
And that proverb. Otherwise,
I wouldn't have understood.

1343
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:35,160
Mrs. Tabusso confessed.
Finally she said...

1344
01:45:35,280 --> 01:45:37,800
"Riviera and Garrone

1345
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:41,360
were a pig and a homosexual
who got what they deserved."

1346
01:45:41,480 --> 01:45:43,400
What a mentality!

1347
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:52,360
Are you sleeping?

1348
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:58,120
Poor me! It's late!
I have my duties.

1349
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,800
No. Just a moment! Listen...

1350
01:46:03,080 --> 01:46:04,640
What duties?

1351
01:46:05,280 --> 01:46:08,880
- Even on Sunday?
- I must finish packing for vacation.

1352
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:12,040
I didn't pack
because of your investigation.

1353
01:46:12,160 --> 01:46:14,000
Excuse me!

1354
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:18,480
We're leaving tomorrow. Bye!

1355
01:46:19,160 --> 01:46:22,040
- When will you return?
- I don't know.

1356
01:46:22,160 --> 01:46:24,360
We're going to Switzerland
in September. Bye!

1357
01:46:54,280 --> 01:46:55,680
Alright.

1358
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:06,120
Massimo, are you looking for a taxi?

1359
01:47:06,240 --> 01:47:08,080
Yes, but there are none.

1360
01:47:08,200 --> 01:47:09,880
Get in. I'll accompany you.

1361
01:47:14,200 --> 01:47:17,320
The city is deserted.
Everyone has left.

1362
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:19,840
You can't even find a taxi.

1363
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:26,400
- How do you pronounce "taxi"?
- One says "taxi".

1364
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:28,720
I knew it! I say "taxÃ¬".

1365
01:47:28,840 --> 01:47:31,280
"Taxi" is what they say in London.

1366
01:47:31,400 --> 01:47:34,240
Imitating foreign accents
is silly and vulgar.

1367
01:47:34,400 --> 01:47:36,560
- They say "taxÃ¬" in Paris.
- Then we're even.

1368
01:47:36,680 --> 01:47:39,160
No, because in Italian...
