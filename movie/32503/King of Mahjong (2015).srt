1
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,340
Wait for me

2
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,930
Relax, we're just playing mahjong

3
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:49,410
Ah Fatt

4
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,110
Give me a serving of Three Great Scholars

5
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:53,280
Got it, no problem

6
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,050
- I'm on it - Be quick about it

7
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:13,700
White Dragon, Red Dragon, Green Dragon

8
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,240
Isn't that the Three Great Scholars?

9
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,170
Sassy, get to work

10
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,180
Pretty sure she's not here

11
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,330
Nancy, I've got your West Wind tile

12
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,640
- Let me send you to your doom - Pong

13
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,300
Watch it, or you'll meet your doom

14
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,180
- Green Dragon - Pong

15
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,680
You want to win? Dream on

16
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,390
Pong

17
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,880
Crap

18
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,690
Pong

19
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:05,960
Pong again and again

20
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,260
Don't bite off more than you can chew

21
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,730
Ah Lian you haven't ordered,
what do you want to eat?

22
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:14,770
I'm hungry two fishballs would be nice

23
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,730
I'm dizzy from al the
Pong that is going around

24
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:20,270
I need a Panadol

25
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,430
- Just that one capsule - One capsule

26
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,440
White Dragon

27
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,110
I'll Pong

28
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,580
Don't mess it up, can't you see
she's on to a Four Large Blessings hand

29
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,120
Don't make me lose my grocery money as well

30
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,850
Will it kill you to just let me win once?

31
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,290
Sure, the weakest hand shall prevail

32
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:38,880
Show me what you've got, dare you

33
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,390
North Wind

34
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,190
You scared me

35
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,730
Tiger, you want a Panadol, right?

36
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,870
I have one

37
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:51,200
Don't take everything you're offered

38
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,440
Even if you picked it up
yourself, double check

39
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,150
Kong

40
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:08,890
Jinx..

41
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:10,990
Kong again

42
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,650
Jinx..

43
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,790
Kong…pay up please

44
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,350
Here you go again

45
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,630
Three draws and you couldn't even get t,
you'll lose for sure

46
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:22,260
It ain't over until it's over

47
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,430
Come on, Nancy

48
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,630
Move aside

49
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:29,440
Jinx..

50
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,870
Three Circles

51
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,880
Self-Draw win

52
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,750
Four Small Blessings and three Kongs

53
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,080
How much do you think is the total winnings?

54
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,980
I'm a newbie at mahjong,
but this seems like a big win

55
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,180
Haven't you heard of "the weakest hand
shall prevail?

56
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:44,160
You watch out, the ghosts
might follow you home

57
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,580
If I knew I'd lose

58
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,320
I'd have gone home to watch
my wives play mahjong

59
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,290
Come on, we're neighbours, don't say that

60
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:54,200
A little gambling never hurt anyone

61
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,500
We're just having fun

62
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:59,300
Come on, pay up

63
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,910
- There goes my money - You little rascal

64
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,170
I asked you to pack yong tau fool

65
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,310
and here you are playing games

66
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,320
Stand right there, don't run

67
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,910
I won't f you stop chasing

68
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:16,010
Talking back now, eh?

69
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,420
Self-Draw win

70
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,790
The candy is mine

71
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,360
You' even settle for a Chicken Hand?

72
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,990
It'll bring bigger wins

73
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,660
Didn't you say you only
play but don't gamble?

74
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,730
That's why on y won some candy

75
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,140
And I'm the one who bought the candy

76
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:38,080
What's the matter? You want some?

77
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,840
No, today you're going to learn
how to lose gracefully

78
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,020
Alright, lets learn about sharing first today

79
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,050
What's the matter? Don t you want some candy?

80
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,790
Mr Yang

81
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:02,430
Well well well , look who we have here

82
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,830
Wayne Yang

83
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,200
Haven't I told you

84
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,240
not to gamble here after school?

85
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,270
Which part of that did you not understand?

86
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,370
We weren't gambling

87
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:17,320
Yeah, don't twist the facts,
we were just sharing candies

88
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,350
Did you see us gambling with your own eyes?

89
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,420
Although no money was involved

90
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,890
But playing mahjong is gambling

91
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:26,190
And that's wrong

92
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,850
Playing mahjong doesn't necessarily
mean we're gambling

93
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,920
I was teaching them mathematics and history

94
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,970
No, you were clearly gambling

95
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,200
Don't deny it

96
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,070
Deny? Don't you know?

97
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:42,400
This isn't just mahjong,
it's the essence of our culture

98
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,100
Go!

99
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:48,310
Mahjong is a card game created in China

100
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,880
Well-known and well-loved in the whole world

101
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:54,790
There are many different
theories on its origins

102
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,760
Due to the fact that it's
been around for so long

103
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,490
Some say that in 500 B.C

104
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:00,790
When Confucius was travelling all over China

105
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,430
He created the game mahjong
to spread his teachings

106
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,470
Using the three tiles of Red Dragon,
Green Dragon, and White Dragon

107
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,830
to represent the Three Virtues

108
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,930
love sincerity and filial piety

109
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:14,910
Commonly known as loyalty,
filial piety and righteousness

110
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,570
That's all good

111
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:20,210
But why do the tiles need to be so big?

112
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,180
You…

113
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,420
Such a big tile…

114
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:27,010
Carving such a big tile.

115
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:30,850
Right

116
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,290
That's correct

117
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,450
Later on, duel to different requirements

118
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:38,930
mahjong kept evolving

119
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,460
And finally settled with the 108-tile version

120
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,440
Representing the 108 warriors
of the Water Margin Legend

121
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,600
With the addition of various flower tiles

122
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:49,800
The whole set has 144 tiles

123
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:52,510
This is a flower

124
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,280
It's the bird

125
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,880
Centipede

126
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:05,980
It's a live, and it wants to bite me

127
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,930
Every player has 13 tiles

128
00:08:07,1000 --> 00:08:10,160
To represent the 13 weeks n a single season

129
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:13,360
There are 52 weeks in the four seasons,
totalling 364 days

130
00:08:13,1000 --> 00:08:15,970
The winning tile

131
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,630
represents the final day of a year

132
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:21,360
To make it 365 days, one complete year

133
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:26,710
Master, is there an ace tile to every suit?

134
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,510
Of course Little Monkey

135
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,680
Mah… mahjong

136
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:35,320
Pay… pay up

137
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,290
Playing mahjong is commonly
referred to by the Chinese

138
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,200
As playing eight rounds or "dry swimming"

139
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,790
A square table is used for playing mahjong

140
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:51,330
Which represents North, South, East, West

141
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:55,000
As well as Spring, Summer, Autumn Winter

142
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,540
- Four Bamboos - I'll take it

143
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:00,340
One tile discarded and three players win

144
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,080
Mahjong has been passed down for generations

145
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,850
Becoming a form of
entertainment in people's lives

146
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:14,220
Even the aunties enjoy a game of mahjong

147
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,590
Mahjong became a form of entertainment
and also a sport

148
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,860
It can foster relationships

149
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,760
Prevent Alzheimer's

150
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:30,540
Hurry up…

151
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,510
Finally I'm here

152
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:44,520
Come on

153
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,290
Eleven

154
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,800
Two Bamboos

155
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,100
Four Bamboos

156
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,060
I'll take it

157
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,610
One tile discarded and three players win

158
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,610
- Where are you going? - Toilet

159
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,610
- No way - You're wriggling out of this?

160
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,080
We've waited for a year for you
to walk to this table

161
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,120
You might take another two years
to walk to the loo

162
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:14,380
Pay up before you go

163
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:19,420
Now it's becoming ever more convenient
to play mahjong

164
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:22,760
It's even available online

165
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,460
We can play mahjong anytime

166
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,430
anywhere

167
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:32,330
See they are so well versed n history

168
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,600
You call this history?

169
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,630
Don't be a bad example to the kids

170
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:38,340
Everyone learns their history
from the TV these days

171
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,310
Nobody takes it seriously

172
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:42,910
At east their history improved

173
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:46,610
Since picking up mahjong
they've scored full marks in history

174
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,610
What's the matter?
Not willing to admit defeat?

175
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,520
Let's have a bet then

176
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:53,280
Sure…bring it on

177
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,350
Alright, same rules

178
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:56,520
If I win

179
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,500
you can't stop them from
coming to pay with me

180
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:01,760
And, you have to stop bothering me for a week

181
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,330
- And what if I win… - Okay

182
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,510
Dinner, movies, whatever you want

183
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,480
Everyone has 9 tiles, from One Character
to Nine Character

184
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,710
The first to complete the
suit n order shall win

185
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,040
Let's go

186
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:48,880
I'm done

187
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:54,850
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 correct

188
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:59,380
3 7 9 8 4 1 5 6 2 wrong

189
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,860
Sassy sister won

190
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,930
Mr. Yang lost

191
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:07,530
Sir

192
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,830
What a pity

193
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,700
Don't worry sir, you'll get used to losing

194
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:14,540
It's not your first time

195
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,770
losing to Sister Sassy anyway

196
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:18,040
Come let's continue playing

197
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:22,780
Let's carry on, Sir has to
go back to teaching

198
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,430
What's the matter? Are you okay?

199
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:50,270
I'm fine It's just that,
you eat with such elegance

200
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,240
As your father, I feel contented

201
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:53,910
That's great

202
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,530
- What do you think if.. . - Aright

203
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,100
- Actually… - I get it

204
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,710
- She.. - I said cut it

205
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:28,110
You want me to be like her

206
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:31,080
Talk softer, be more gentle,
like a lady right?

207
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:35,050
What's so bad about me now?

208
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:39,520
You are perfect as you are

209
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,830
- But if you could… - Dad

210
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,260
There are no ifs and buts in this world

211
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:52,210
I just want you to have a boyfriend

212
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,700
In case, one day, I'm not here anymore

213
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,540
Not here? Where are you going?

214
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:59,000
Back to meet my maker

215
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,910
Why would you meet your
maker all of a sudden?

216
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,710
Not all of a sudden

217
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:06,690
History tells us, people die

218
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:10,190
No, anyone can die except you

219
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,660
You can't leave me alone

220
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,000
Okay, I won t die then

221
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,520
That's more like it

222
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:26,030
But even if I don't d e
you'll still need to date

223
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:31,580
I think that Wayne Yang is not bad

224
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:33,340
You got to be kidding, Dad

225
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:34,900
Him? Not bad?

226
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,850
He's old-fashioned and dumb

227
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,480
He stutters and he can't even play mahjong

228
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,250
Every time I play with him, he loses

229
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:41,880
What's so good about him?

230
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,390
All those can be helped

231
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:47,120
Old-fashioned means he's honest

232
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,490
A slow talker is better than a smooth tailker

233
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,120
As for playing mahjong, it's easy to learn

234
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:00,470
What are you doing?

235
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,100
Hey

236
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,280
Hey

237
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,780
Are you guys serious?

238
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:13,790
Yep, it's here

239
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:14,620
Who's making a din here?

240
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:17,350
We're looking for Pak Chong Fatt where is he?

241
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:20,290
What Pak Chong Fatt? Hong Chong Fatt?

242
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,530
There's only Chow Yun Fatt

243
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:01,160
- Bugger off - Wong Tin Ba

244
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,700
Who's that guy?

245
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,470
He's the World Mahjong Champion

246
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,210
for 10 consecutive years

247
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:15,980
The modern day King of Mahjong, Wong Tin Ba

248
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,010
He's got style

249
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,650
What's wrong with the plastic bags today?

250
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,690
Those dace a so aren't fresh enough

251
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,060
Sassy, where did you get those plastic bags?

252
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:34,560
Where did you get those dace?

253
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,500
Hey there handsome,
how many seats do you need?

254
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:41,800
It's been a while, Pak Chong Fatt

255
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,900
What?

256
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,040
Pak Chong Fatt

257
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:47,550
Born on the 9th of October 1970

258
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:49,980
Libra 'O' blood type

259
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,880
His pass on is to help those in need

260
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,480
Cut the crap

261
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,550
Tell me what's their relationship

262
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,220
He was taught by the same
master as Wong Tin Ba

263
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:02,820
Rumour has it that,
after they turned on each other

264
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:06,160
Pak Chong Fatt vanished
from the world of mahjong

265
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,930
Brother Fatt is Pak Chong Fatt?

266
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:17,440
Are you sure you got the right person?

267
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,880
What do you think?

268
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,210
I never thought you could find me here

269
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,340
How's it going, my little brother?
It's been so long

270
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,220
Is this for your birthday party
or your daughter's wedding?

271
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,850
It's to challange you to a duel

272
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,720
The next mahjong championship is coming up

273
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:31,420
I must have a duel with you this time

274
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:34,720
It's been a while since I've played,
you should cut down too

275
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,860
I'll ask you again,
are you up for a duel or not?

276
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:40,590
- No thanks - Come on

277
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,540
- Nah - Come on

278
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,930
- No thanks - Come on

279
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:44,670
Nope

280
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,430
For god's sake quit dilly-dallying

281
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:48,100
Happiness can't be forced

282
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,870
Sometimes you need to
take a gamble for your happiness

283
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,640
You have no choice, because I have chosen you

284
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:53,870
I must gamble with you this time

285
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:41,950
Roasted drumstick

286
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,570
Such a pity, to become a
mute at such a young age

287
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,870
Alright, let's have a drumstick

288
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,610
- Girl - I'm not your daughter

289
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,770
I'm not your daughter,
and you're not my father

290
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,510
How did you find out?

291
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:10,150
Are you for real? I was just joking

292
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,520
How could it turn out that way?

293
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:14,690
I thought you were mute,
turns out you're a retard

294
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,760
You are as short as I am

295
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,390
Could you possibly be the daughter
of our neighbour, Tall Wai?

296
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,260
No matter what, from now on

297
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,800
You eat yours, I eat mine,
we stay out of each other's way

298
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,800
Why? We're a family

299
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:25,100
Have you ever considered me family?

300
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:28,270
- You seem pissed - You bet I am

301
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,000
My father was the King of
Mahjong Pak Chong Fatt

302
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,570
And I only know it now You
see me as your family?

303
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,010
You've kept a lot of things from me as well

304
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:35,950
Like what, tell me

305
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,180
When you sat for your exam

306
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,980
you watched my romance
"action" videos instead of studying

307
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:40,920
and I didn't say anything

308
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,480
Alright, stop it

309
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,760
It's not that I don't want to tell you,
but you never asked

310
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:48,290
Why would I talk about these things
out of the blue

311
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,190
Okay, let me ask you now

312
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,400
Why sell yong tau foo when you can be
the King of Mahjong?

313
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:55,200
Let's grab a drumstick first before we start

314
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,290
Stop pretending or I'll chase you out

315
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,270
Once upon a time

316
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,780
Speak Mandarin, sit down

317
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:09,470
I thought for such an important event,
English would be more apt

318
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,710
English? Your English sounds like Tam

319
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,050
Don't try too hard

320
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,120
We'll have to start from 20 years ago

321
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:17,880
Hurry up

322
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:21,360
Twenty five years ago

323
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:24,420
Zhang Shun You, the Wong Tin
Ba of today, and I

324
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,090
Learnt mahjong together from our

325
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:29,290
Master Ru from a very young age

326
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,740
Five

327
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,610
Mine

328
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,070
Yours

329
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:45,750
Mine

330
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:47,380
Yours

331
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,620
Mine

332
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,320
Yours

333
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:51,650
Skip

334
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,290
Next

335
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:55,490
Reveal

336
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,530
The Thirteen Wonders

337
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,990
Your hand is

338
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,530
decided the moment the tiles are stacked

339
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:03,160
If you're not the dealer

340
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,830
Try to put your tiles over here

341
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,260
Look, they're all Bamboos

342
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,470
Told you…

343
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:13,240
Master always said, you win by not gambling

344
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:16,870
Winning or losing is just an illusion,
lose your money but never your life

345
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:19,210
Only the good-hearted wins

346
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:23,950
He also said,I often win because
I don't harp on winning or losing

347
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,490
Is it really that important,
winning or losing when playing mahjong?

348
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,620
You win this round,
you could well lose the next

349
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,820
What's the big deal

350
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:34,330
Green Dragon, Four Large Blessings

351
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:42,670
You need a single Eight Bamboo,
you have a full suit of Bamboos

352
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,270
You lack a tile of Green Dragon

353
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:47,010
How should I play this Green Dragon tile?

354
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:52,310
Ah Fatt, Ah You

355
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:54,680
I think it's time

356
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,310
So ear y? Didn't we just have our lunch?

357
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:59,860
All you think about is eating

358
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:02,420
I meant it's time you two have a duel

359
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,620
The winner will succeed
me as the King of Mahjong

360
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,800
What happens to the loser then?

361
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,570
He will become the junior fellow apprentice
of the King of Mahjong

362
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,340
Might as we be the sidekick

363
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,470
I didn't say anything

364
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,370
Alright, best of three rounds

365
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:20,800
Begin now

366
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:30,720
Five Circles

367
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,420
Game

368
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,390
- The Three Great Scholars - Wow, you're good

369
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,060
Wow, the Three Great Scholars

370
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:39,830
Thanks for the recognition

371
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,690
Alright. Self-Draw West Wind

372
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:44,070
Chicken Hand

373
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,400
Damn you

374
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,700
Why would you even win on a Chicken Hand

375
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,040
You like chicken that much

376
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:50,940
Do you even know how to play mahjong

377
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:12,220
Green Dragon

378
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,670
Game

379
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,290
The Thirteen Wonders

380
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,200
Master I've won two of the three rounds

381
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:23,270
I'm your successor, now teach me
the legendary mahjong kungfu

382
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:26,040
I'll announce who's the winner

383
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,310
Of course

384
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,750
The winner is

385
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:32,340
Ah Fatt

386
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,420
Why him?

387
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:37,750
That's the Thirteen Wonders right there

388
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:40,580
I didn't say the one who wins will succeed me

389
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,550
You're right

390
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,430
I knew it

391
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,970
No matter how I fare,
you'll always see me as the loser

392
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:50,900
- Ah You listen to me - Say no more

393
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:52,160
I've listened to you long enough

394
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,470
You talk all day long

395
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,060
I've had enough of it

396
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:58,000
From today onwards,
I'm not listening to you anymore

397
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,480
I'm not your discipel anymore

398
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:09,820
God brother

399
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:13,590
So that was how Wong Tin Ba left our master

400
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,960
And went on to challenge everyone everywhere

401
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:17,930
From India to Egypt

402
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,660
From Egypt to Japlan

403
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:21,730
From Japlan to the China

404
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:25,360
Challenging the Kings of
Mahjong of every region

405
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:27,570
Ninety Thousand (Nine Character)

406
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:29,340
Red Middle (Red Dragon)

407
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,870
Children

408
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,340
Two Circles

409
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,620
Big Four Happiness (Four
Large Blessings), game

410
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,300
Sensei

411
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:07,480
Get rid of the tiles that you don't need,
no point keeping them

412
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:08,480
Self-Draw

413
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,450
Why are you discarding your
self-drawn winning tile…

414
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:13,420
Mahjong?

415
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:17,150
Hold on

416
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,890
The Three Great Scholars

417
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,430
- After you - See you

418
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:01,360
Finally, Wong Tin Ba got what he wished for

419
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:03,060
He defeated all the best
mahjong players in the world

420
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:05,630
And even won the title of King of Mahjong
for 10 consecutive years

421
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:09,030
But one thing could never wrap my head around

422
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:11,010
You gave up the Green
Dragon tile for Wong Tin Ba

423
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,140
So by right he should've won

424
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,140
Why did your master
announce you as the window?

425
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:19,050
Later on, Master explained to me

426
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,350
I've lost

427
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,890
why did you say I won, master?

428
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:28,630
Do you think I'm a renovation contractor?

429
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:30,730
I can see

430
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:33,790
He won in the game of mahjong

431
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:35,960
But lost duel to his character

432
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,000
My successor must have a good character

433
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:40,500
Winning without character s meaningless

434
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,100
It's been days since I heard from you
where have you been?

435
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:14,440
Everywhere

436
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:16,130
Any place where I won't see a poker face

437
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:18,040
a black face and two stupid faces

438
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,810
I've been there

439
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:36,260
You two look very free

440
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,220
Why don't you go accomplany the boss

441
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,500
Spend some time with your dad

442
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:50,100
Don't keep avoiding him

443
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,040
I'll just be another black face

444
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:54,470
Doesn't make a difference

445
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,330
You find that funny?

446
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,860
Don't you?

447
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:13,960
Yes

448
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,330
It's really hilarious

449
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,060
Why did you hit me?

450
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:22,860
Hit me? You…

451
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,710
How dare you lay your finger
on the great Wong Tin Ba

452
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,100
Game, 108 Warriors of…

453
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:48,730
What are you doing?

454
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,790
There are mosquitos

455
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:52,060
I have such a big house

456
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,230
This mosquito is actually my brother

457
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:56,540
He talks to me, through h s buzzing

458
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,440
Now that you killed it
who's going to talk to me?

459
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:59,710
You don't talk to me

460
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,870
And I don't want to talk to these two

461
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,980
You three jump into the water

462
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,180
Where did Deedee Zhang go again?

463
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,330
Right?

464
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:19,060
There you are

465
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:21,570
Baby who's that?

466
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,100
Who are you?

467
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:25,540
He should know who I am

468
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:50,960
Pure Honour Hand, Four Large Blessings,
Full Blossoms

469
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:55,230
- That's 88 folds, everybody - What a big win

470
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,960
It's nothing

471
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:01,200
What are you doing?
Where did the extra tiles come from

472
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,670
Hey are you trying to cheat here?

473
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,140
Cheating?

474
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:05,440
Are you kidding me?

475
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:07,310
It's written here No cheating

476
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,110
Do you think I'm blind?
Do you think I'm stupid?

477
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:11,650
Stop mucking about,
do you know what you're talking about?

478
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,310
They say bringing mahjong tiles
around this year brings good luck

479
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:16,320
And you thought I'm cheating…

480
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,250
What took him so long

481
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:22,730
Do you know what time it is now?

482
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,490
Must've come from here

483
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,530
What's with the crowd?
Did Michele Yeoh turn up?

484
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,130
All the neighbours want
you to be their master

485
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,330
I'm number 15 in line

486
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:33,170
You people are crazy

487
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,500
When did I say I'm accepting disciples?

488
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:35,510
You're Pak Chong Fatt

489
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,240
The first ever King of Mahjong,
of course we'd like to learn from you

490
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:40,970
If you're here for the
Tofu, I'm more than happy

491
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:44,350
But if you're here to learn
mahjong, please leave

492
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,930
Master I've been having a bad hand in mahjong

493
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,930
Any tips?

494
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:59,400
That's your fate

495
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:01,760
Don't ask me how would I know?

496
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:03,200
Why are two of you

497
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:05,400
holding me down instead of standing in line?

498
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:07,600
I listen clearer

499
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:09,110
and learn more this way

500
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,570
My reason is simple, just want to touch you

501
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,370
Do it on me first

502
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:24,950
You're such a pain

503
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,060
Come on, teach me a few tricks

504
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,130
Which one of you is Pak Chong Fatt?

505
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:37,590
am, what's the matter?

506
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:41,940
- Who? - Sure y not me

507
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:43,410
It's him

508
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,310
You two idiots

509
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,440
It's me

510
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:49,910
Miss, may I know what you're doing here?

511
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:53,710
I suppose you don't remember
the King of Gai Hu?

512
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,480
The one whom I defeated

513
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:57,920
in the inaugural championship?

514
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,720
That's right, he s my father

515
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:00,950
So you're his daughter

516
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:02,490
Come and give Uncle Fatt a hug

517
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,230
Come on

518
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:09,420
That year

519
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,440
He made it to the final s against all odds

520
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:14,630
But you beat him hands down

521
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:16,680
Since then he became like that

522
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,110
Never to smile again

523
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:22,640
Alright, since you're here

524
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,150
I'll let you have vengeance

525
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:26,810
You two, go distract her

526
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:29,820
Actually, we…

527
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:31,750
Today

528
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:33,990
Let us have a due

529
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,860
- Hey, you - You're up

530
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:38,390
I already said I've forgotten
how to play mahjong

531
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,930
If you don't play, you'll get it from us

532
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,990
Come on, if not now then when

533
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:44,000
If you don't play,
we'll annoy the he out of you

534
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:46,040
- I'll pester you - Won't leave you alone

535
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,110
Come on, play with her

536
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,000
Alright then

537
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,340
Let's do this

538
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,450
- Four Circles - Pong

539
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:10,500
East Wind

540
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:13,800
One Circle

541
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:17,020
Pong One Circle, here's a Four Circles tile

542
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,240
Lucky you getting the final tile

543
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:22,570
South Wind

544
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:27,570
Want to make a Pure Hand of Circle,
watch me spoil it

545
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,180
Eight Circles

546
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:34,240
Pong

547
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,050
Nine Circles

548
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,690
Pong, here's a Seven Circles

549
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,820
Pong Seven Circles

550
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,890
9 Pieces Penalty, it's on you
if he were to win

551
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:52,830
I'm sorry Hidden Six Circles Kong

552
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:54,240
Self-Draw win on Replacement Tile

553
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:57,540
I must win to make my father smile again

554
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,240
Five Circles

555
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:05,140
Get a Self-Draw win, come on

556
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:09,850
Kong

557
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:14,290
Eight Circles

558
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:36,070
Two Character

559
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,600
I'll take that Two Character

560
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:41,040
I'll discard a One Character

561
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,750
Game

562
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,380
What?

563
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:48,260
You're waiting for a single tile
of One Character. Snatch her game

564
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:50,300
That's none of your business

565
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,060
Are you playing or am I playing?

566
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:55,360
They came so far for revenge, w nning on
a Ch cken Hand doesn't make sense

567
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:58,600
Chicken Hand, are you for real?

568
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,430
That's a bit too lame, don't you think?

569
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:01,740
It's called a Chicken Hand

570
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:04,070
of course it's lame

571
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:10,010
I've waited 20 years for this

572
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,110
I finally got my revenge

573
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:15,020
To be able to pay with a mahjong expert
like Pak Chong Fatt

574
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,420
Look, your father is smiling again

575
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:20,790
You shouldn't have waited
for so long for that

576
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,090
f you had understood this 20 years ago

577
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,600
You wouldn't have been upset for so long

578
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:28,360
Playing mahjong is just
a form of entertainment

579
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:29,700
When it's done, get on with it

580
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,960
That's a load of bull

581
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,000
Remember how I've taught you?

582
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,040
What should be done after you've lost?

583
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:43,450
What do you want?

584
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:52,780
Good manners

585
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,250
Thank you

586
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:04,030
Don't even think of kissing me, I'll hit you

587
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:15,440
Ramona

588
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,780
It really is you

589
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:23,150
Sir, have you seen my husband?

590
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:26,350
What's the matter with you?
Don't you recognise me?

591
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:28,550
I'm your husband, Ah Fatt

592
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,590
It can't be

593
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,990
My husband is very handsome

594
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,330
He's tall and macho

595
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,500
And he's very good at mahjong

596
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:38,470
Look

597
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:43,000
Take a good look at yourself

598
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:01,530
Not the chest, the tattoo

599
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:02,790
It's the same, look

600
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:07,160
This type of tattoo is so common

601
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:13,030
My husband is so handsome, so macho

602
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:16,730
But you're short and stout,
and you look so shifty

603
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:17,940
And you stink

604
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,440
How could you be my husband?

605
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:20,040
There are so many people here

606
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:22,410
can you cut me some slack?

607
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,780
But you're not my husband

608
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:26,910
I really am your husband

609
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:28,250
You're not

610
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,020
- I am - You're not

611
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:33,360
You leave me with no choice

612
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,360
But to share this with everyone

613
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,630
Your body anatomy s very weird

614
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:38,990
If I touch you here, you'll scream

615
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,100
If I touch you here, you'll get excited

616
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:43,700
If I touch your head you'll be obedient

617
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,730
Am I right?

618
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:48,400
Shut up

619
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:49,940
How come you know so much about me?

620
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:51,440
Because I'm your husband

621
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:56,570
- Ah Fatt? - Yes

622
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,420
Come on

623
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:00,950
Where is this place?

624
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:03,280
This is not a common place,
it s Brother Fatt's house

625
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:06,120
- Isn't that my house? - Yes

626
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:10,400
Nan Yang

627
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:12,520
Didn't I come from a rich household?

628
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:14,890
Come have a seat

629
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:16,820
I'll get you a drink

630
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,600
Sassy, we have a guest

631
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,410
Look who's here

632
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,850
Who's so important?

633
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:32,180
Take a look yourself

634
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:35,010
Hey is this your wife?

635
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:38,510
His wife? She left a long time ago

636
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:40,650
Why is your wife so bad?

637
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:44,420
That's not all, she's materialistic, greedy

638
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,990
- Ridiculous, shameless… - Sassy

639
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:49,430
How can you insult your mother
when she's right in front of you?

640
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:50,830
At east turn around

641
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,560
She's really your mother

642
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,000
- My mother? - My daughter

643
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:55,300
That is correct

644
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:57,710
Your mother's daughter is you…
right, that makes her your mother!

645
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,040
Why did you bring her home?

646
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:01,170
Don't tell me we need to
seek your permission first

647
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:03,310
This is my home, not yours

648
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,980
Hey you said this s my home
isn't it Ah Fatt's home?

649
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:07,420
Your home has been broken

650
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,250
since you left us when I was 2 years old

651
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,150
Stop arguing

652
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:13,090
Yes

653
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:15,860
I know this is a bit too sudden for you

654
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,160
It's the same for me

655
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,360
Did you know, when I saw her alone today

656
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:22,490
Looking for her husband on the streets

657
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:24,130
Isn't she looking for me?

658
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,160
But she couldn't recognise me,
even though I'm so handsome

659
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:29,040
The only thing she recognises is money anyway

660
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:30,870
Don't be fooled by her

661
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,340
I'm not that stupid

662
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:34,000
I brought her to the doctor, the doctor said…

663
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,570
Apparently a year after she left us

664
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:37,240
She lost her memory after an accident

665
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:38,410
Lost her memory?

666
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,040
Is this some sort of lame soap opera plot

667
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,950
Soap operas are indeed lame

668
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:46,580
But she really is your mother

669
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,830
It' hasn't been easy for her,
being alone all these years

670
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:56,530
You'll understand these matters of the heart
when you grow up

671
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:05,440
You can see for yourself

672
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:08,040
Who in the right mind eats mahjong tiles?

673
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:13,740
What? I'm hungry

674
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,320
You're not supposed to eat mahjong tiles

675
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,580
I'll cook for you if you are hungry

676
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,020
Let's go outside

677
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:26,130
Loss of memory?

678
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:31,370
Mom

679
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,740
Let me teach you how to play mahjong today

680
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:36,300
Mahjong? Is it fun?

681
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,740
It's okay if you don't know

682
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,870
Within a few days and a few losses

683
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:41,040
You'll get the hang of it

684
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:43,280
Come on

685
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:44,680
I've got no money

686
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,580
If I lose, I only have
my daughter to offer you

687
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:48,280
Let us restart the game,
since she just sat down

688
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:49,790
- Sure - Let's go

689
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:56,650
Eight Circles

690
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,530
Nine Character

691
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:01,830
Can I win now?

692
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:03,530
You don't have enough folds

693
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:06,900
Just follow whatever the others are doing

694
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,070
Discard that Nine Character tile

695
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,670
Three Character

696
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,480
Can I win now?

697
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:23,180
How is it possible that you still can't win

698
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:25,650
Self-Draw, game

699
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,160
The Thirteen Wonders

700
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:29,060
You scared the daylight out of me

701
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:38,440
I can't see through this mess

702
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:43,900
Eight-and-a-half Pairs Pure Hand

703
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:45,200
Is that a big win?

704
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,710
I win

705
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:49,870
Pay up

706
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:12,690
Five Bamboos

707
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:21,240
Self-Draw

708
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:23,010
Nine Gates Hand

709
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,220
Pay up, please

710
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,080
Are you sure you are crazy?

711
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,410
It really doesn't seem like it

712
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:29,510
Thank you

713
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:31,490
When are we going to play again?

714
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,990
Come earlier tomorrow,
and you can play with yourself

715
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,820
Who's going to play with you again

716
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:38,190
First time and we've already lost so much

717
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:40,750
Do you know how many people
I'll have to massage to learn this much

718
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:42,360
I lost my grocery money again

719
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,430
Girl, they are such sore losers

720
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:48,940
Ignore them, we're rich

721
00:42:58,350 --> 00:42:59,540
What are you doing?

722
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:02,080
Sewing on some buttons

723
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:04,150
I saw the buttons on your father's clothes

724
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:05,880
they don't match

725
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,290
Every single one of them

726
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:10,460
If you really cared for him,
you wouldn't have left

727
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:17,890
I was wrong

728
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:23,430
thought could live a good life
having married the King of Mahjong

729
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:26,270
But he suddenly quit

730
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:29,410
I got angry, so I left in a fit of anger

731
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:35,380
I never thought it'd be so hard to turn back

732
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:38,850
I know you both are still mad at me

733
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,450
I've got nothing to say

734
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:46,290
If you really don't want to see me

735
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:48,530
I can leave any time

736
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:54,200
I'm really leaving

737
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,610
Take care of your father, I'm leaving

738
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:05,070
You come and go as you please

739
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:06,170
you think this is a hotel?

740
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:09,710
I've taken care of your
husband all these years

741
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:11,350
It's your turn now

742
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:16,530
One more thing

743
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:20,300
Don't be fooled by his carefree out look

744
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:22,960
He's never forgotten you

745
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:25,000
Take good care of him

746
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,160
It's so hot

747
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:19,420
I want to be a responsible husband

748
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:27,770
What kungfu is he practising?

749
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:30,170
Could it be the legendary mahjong kungfu?

750
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,570
Ah, so you've invited yourself

751
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:47,740
Drinking alcohol in broad day light

752
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:51,650
Sassy doesn't care about me anymore

753
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,220
What makes you say that?

754
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:55,390
She's been Ignoring me…

755
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:57,390
I think It's time to let her go

756
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:59,230
She only cares for her mom right now

757
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:02,630
What about my life? I'm hopeless

758
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:04,190
So that's what you think

759
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:06,290
You're too pessimistic

760
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:09,300
I know my daughter

761
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:11,140
Her anger is fleeting

762
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,980
It doesn't matter if she's angry with me

763
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:19,710
The point Is I don't have
a place in her heart

764
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:21,880
I'm not important to her

765
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:23,720
If that's the case

766
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:26,460
Then why would she have wagers with you?

767
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,890
Because she wants to defeat me

768
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,590
She wants me to back off

769
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:32,630
That silly girl

770
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:36,590
Every time she plays mahjong with you
she looks at you in a different way

771
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,470
Doesn't that prove that she likes you?

772
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:42,770
Remember, to be a good man…

773
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:45,170
One must not be greedy

774
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:47,170
And one must not be impatient

775
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:49,940
Even you have the lousiest hand

776
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:51,180
Don't be afraid

777
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:55,020
Sometimes, to lose is to win

778
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,290
Get it?

779
00:46:59,290 --> 00:47:03,160
To lose is to win

780
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:09,130
I get it

781
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:11,470
Thank you

782
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:13,440
I understand now

783
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:16,130
Thank you

784
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:18,970
Sassy, here I come

785
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:22,840
Most handsome guys in this world are dumb

786
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,910
Sister Sassy is having a
duel with Mr. Yang again

787
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:30,850
Ready,go

788
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:44,570
So fast? Let's reveal it and see

789
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,170
Sir, don't you know 1, 2, 3?

790
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:50,670
What are you doing?

791
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:51,830
Are you trying to be funny?

792
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:53,500
Sorry

793
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:55,570
Give me one last chance

794
00:47:55,650 --> 00:47:57,410
One last chance, let's do this again

795
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:06,420
Every time she plays mahjong with you
she looks at you in a different way

796
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:21,060
Wow Sister Sassy wins again

797
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:23,000
But Mr. Yang completed his hand first

798
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:24,370
So what?

799
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:25,770
I'm pretty sure it's a mess again

800
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,140
Reveal

801
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,110
Wow Mr. Yang

802
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:33,850
You're good, you've won

803
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:38,450
Very good, you've defeated me.
Don't look for me anymore

804
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:40,050
Sassy

805
00:48:41,430 --> 00:48:42,860
Sassy

806
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:44,860
What do you want?

807
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,560
You've said before

808
00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:50,100
If I want to date you,
I'll have to defeat you first

809
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:51,800
So can I ask you out on a date now

810
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,430
Suits you

811
00:48:54,510 --> 00:48:57,130
But I'm telling you,
I have no feelings for you

812
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:00,540
Then why is It that whenever
I play mahjong with you

813
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:03,600
you always gaze at me so gently?

814
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,080
Rubbish

815
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:20,000
Brother Fatt told me

816
00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:24,160
As long as you're the apple of my eye
and vice versa

817
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:26,900
Winning or losing isn't important at all

818
00:49:30,810 --> 00:49:31,710
I…

819
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:34,940
Let's get together

820
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:54,630
Apparently when you fall for someone

821
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:58,570
You'll feel happy even when he defeats you

822
00:49:58,670 --> 00:50:02,440
That's life But hey, what's wrong with that

823
00:50:02,510 --> 00:50:06,270
From the moment you fell for him,
you've already lost

824
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:08,540
Brother Fatt

825
00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:11,450
You're such an expert in love

826
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,850
So why did you break up with mom in the past?

827
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:20,060
Because of love

828
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:22,030
We went separate ways

829
00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:29,490
Your mom and I grew up together

830
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:31,660
She was the girl that everyone coveted

831
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:32,530
Self-draw win, The Thirteen Wonders

832
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:33,900
Smart and pretty

833
00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:35,400
Good at mahjong too

834
00:50:35,470 --> 00:50:38,570
She was known as The
Queen of Thirteen Wonders

835
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,670
Look at her smile

836
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:44,140
Makes my heart skip a beat

837
00:50:53,930 --> 00:50:55,450
We got married later on

838
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:59,360
I won the World Mahjong
Championship that year

839
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:02,400
And became the King of Mahjong

840
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:22,750
- Are you sure? - Is that necessary?

841
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:24,550
I really can't take it anymore

842
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:27,120
Ramona and I were soulmates

843
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:30,790
Since our dating days,
we enjoyed playing mahjong together

844
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:32,990
Such a lovely couple

845
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:35,190
Hubby

846
00:51:35,270 --> 00:51:37,230
She was the only person who could

847
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:39,570
defeat me at the mahjong table

848
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:42,900
This Green Dragon tile is annoying me,
watch me discard it

849
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:47,610
Four Large Blessings, pay up

850
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:50,050
You knew she wanted the Green Dragon,
yet you discarded it

851
00:51:50,350 --> 00:51:52,610
Men

852
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:54,350
Hubby, quick, pay up

853
00:51:54,450 --> 00:51:55,710
What's going on

854
00:51:55,850 --> 00:51:56,340
- She's giving birth - What's going on

855
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:57,180
Give me that

856
00:51:58,890 --> 00:52:00,920
Ramona gave birth soon after

857
00:52:00,990 --> 00:52:03,460
That was the happiest time of our lives

858
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:05,290
Six Circles

859
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:07,020
Sassy

860
00:52:10,370 --> 00:52:11,340
Two Circles

861
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,460
But good times never last

862
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:16,770
Before the 2nd World Mahjong Championships

863
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:19,640
was very stressed

864
00:52:19,710 --> 00:52:21,140
I was terrified of

865
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:24,480
losing my status as the world champion

866
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:28,380
At that moment

867
00:52:28,490 --> 00:52:29,610
I realised playing mahjong

868
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:31,550
no longer means the same anymore

869
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:35,750
I started having second thoughts

870
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:47,160
Hubby

871
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:49,930
I've cooked some ginseng chicken

872
00:52:50,010 --> 00:52:53,540
To help you become the King of Mahjong
for the 2nd time

873
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:57,240
I'm a little reluctant to go

874
00:52:58,350 --> 00:53:00,440
Why?

875
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:02,420
I feel like…

876
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:03,990
Playing mahjong for the sake of competition

877
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:06,820
seems to be deviating
from its original intent

878
00:53:07,230 --> 00:53:09,160
As long as you win every time

879
00:53:09,230 --> 00:53:11,290
What other purpose do you need?

880
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,860
That's not what master taught me

881
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:17,430
I'm warning you

882
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:19,130
because I saw a bright future in you

883
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,000
I'm investing my youth in you

884
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:23,010
I won't allow you to give up

885
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:25,500
Ramona don't go

886
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:28,050
What's going to happen to me and Sassy
if you leave?

887
00:53:28,110 --> 00:53:30,100
My husband the King of Mahjong,
is now a useless man

888
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:32,880
Why should I stay?

889
00:53:32,950 --> 00:53:35,150
What will it take to make you stay?

890
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:36,920
Play a round with me

891
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:39,850
If you win, you can give
the competition a miss

892
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,120
If I win

893
00:53:41,230 --> 00:53:43,350
you have to clinch the
World Mahjong Championship

894
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:45,120
You can't force me like this

895
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:46,960
You're the one forcing me to do this

896
00:53:47,070 --> 00:53:49,690
I could've become the Queen of Mahjong

897
00:53:49,770 --> 00:53:52,400
I gave up everything to marry you,
the King of Mahjong

898
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:55,060
Now you're telling me to give up my dream

899
00:53:58,140 --> 00:53:59,730
Let's play a round then

900
00:54:07,390 --> 00:54:08,410
White Dragon

901
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:11,380
Kong

902
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:13,920
Four Character

903
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:18,360
Red Dragon

904
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:19,730
Kong

905
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:23,930
Eight Circles

906
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:30,130
Green Dragon

907
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:31,470
Kong

908
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:36,240
Seven Bamboos

909
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:41,040
I used to let her win all the time

910
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:43,110
But this time

911
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:06,300
Ramona

912
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:08,700
Chicken Hand

913
00:55:09,210 --> 00:55:12,480
I'm not that important to you after all

914
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:22,020
Little did she know that
I let her go on purpose

915
00:55:22,990 --> 00:55:26,090
Although I didn't want to complete anymore

916
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:30,620
But she was still so young.
She should pursue her dreams

917
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:32,690
I didn't want to hold her back

918
00:55:34,770 --> 00:55:39,000
Your wife was heartless, didn't it hurt you?

919
00:55:40,010 --> 00:55:43,240
That's how youngsters are, they want glamour

920
00:55:43,350 --> 00:55:46,040
Who doesn't want to be the Queen of Mahjong

921
00:55:46,950 --> 00:55:50,820
Do you still love your
wife then, Brother Fatt?

922
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:53,850
Of course

923
00:55:54,930 --> 00:55:57,160
Every second of my life

924
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:10,670
So handsome, let's put that on Facebook

925
00:56:12,010 --> 00:56:13,570
Boss

926
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:16,550
Handsome should be one word, not two

927
00:56:18,350 --> 00:56:20,010
I did it on purpose

928
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:22,420
If not, you wouldn't have come in

929
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:26,050
Boss

930
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,390
People are slamming you on Facebook

931
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:29,120
What are they saying?

932
00:56:29,230 --> 00:56:31,700
They say handsome "should be one word"

933
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,560
Take that picture down immediately

934
00:56:33,630 --> 00:56:37,030
Then upload other stuff to distract them

935
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:39,700
Avoid bad publicity before
the World Mahjong Championships

936
00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:41,070
Okay

937
00:56:41,770 --> 00:56:43,540
How do I spell surprise?

938
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:44,770
Just write it in Chinese

939
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:47,940
Good idea. Surprise

940
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:52,640
Boss, you're so wise what's the surprise?

941
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:56,080
The first ever King of Mahjong versus
the winner for 10 consecutive years

942
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:57,680
Surprising enough?

943
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:00,180
Oh Boss, so you're the
first ever King of Mahjong

944
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:02,730
Only now do I know that Pak Chong Fatt
had won't for 10 consecutive years

945
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,060
I've fed and clothed you two

946
00:57:07,130 --> 00:57:08,760
Yet you don't even know who's who

947
00:57:08,830 --> 00:57:10,230
Look at those trophies behind

948
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:12,530
use them to store my sauces

949
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:13,400
can't you see

950
00:57:18,910 --> 00:57:20,780
What plans do you have?

951
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:25,950
Everything is going according to plan

952
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:46,800
I smell yong tau foo,
this should be the house

953
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:56,710
I'll take it

954
00:57:56,810 --> 00:57:58,680
The Thirteen Wonders

955
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:44,150
Crazy

956
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:46,390
Can't you walk properly?

957
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:49,430
Boss, you already came in this dressing
with a bell in hand

958
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:51,970
Sure y I have to pretend to be possessed
to complement you?

959
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:53,370
Don't talk crap

960
00:58:53,570 --> 00:58:54,200
You've been here for so long

961
00:58:54,270 --> 00:58:55,430
why haven't you reported to me?

962
00:58:55,910 --> 00:58:57,400
Have you found out

963
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:59,240
what kungfu Pak Chong
Fatt has been practising?

964
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:02,610
Yes, I found out that he doesn't
even touch mahjong

965
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:08,250
That's great

966
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:10,790
I finally have reason to sell you to Ethiopia

967
00:59:10,890 --> 00:59:12,250
Just great

968
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:14,380
They suffer from famine and poverty

969
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:15,820
they won't be able to “use” me

970
00:59:15,890 --> 00:59:18,620
They can't use you, but they can eat you

971
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:20,860
Your skin is slightly wrinkled

972
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:22,400
but your flesh is still quite tender

973
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:23,630
- Please, don't - Should worth a dime or two

974
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,300
I did find out a secret of his

975
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,600
What secret? Out with it

976
00:59:27,870 --> 00:59:29,360
He practises a kind of kungfu everyday?

977
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:30,510
What kungfu?

978
00:59:30,910 --> 00:59:34,210
Pa ms joined with eyes focused

979
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:37,300
Tongue and limbs stretched out

980
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:44,490
- Rein in the temples and diaphragm

981
00:59:44,590 --> 00:59:47,110
Take in the energy of the universe
to nourish the brain

982
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:51,390
So, this is Master's Legendary Mahjong Kungfu

983
00:59:52,030 --> 00:59:53,500
Who's peeping?

984
01:00:02,910 --> 01:00:04,740
I get it now

985
01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:09,880
If Pak Chong Fatt can master it, so can I

986
01:00:09,950 --> 01:00:13,510
Let's see who's the real King of Mahjong

987
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:16,810
Your mission now is to persuade him

988
01:00:16,890 --> 01:00:18,650
to join the championships

989
01:00:18,790 --> 01:00:22,920
Only then will your mission be complete

990
01:00:31,070 --> 01:00:35,330
Let's see how you resist my cajolement

991
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:38,430
Hubby

992
01:00:43,150 --> 01:00:44,940
Let's eat first

993
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:48,890
Hubby

994
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:53,380
I have something… to tell you

995
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:56,450
What do you want?

996
01:00:56,530 --> 01:00:57,820
I want to say…

997
01:00:57,900 --> 01:00:59,800
We're back

998
01:01:01,170 --> 01:01:03,190
Dad, mom

999
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:08,860
Fill the bowl

1000
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:12,570
Have they gotten married?

1001
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:13,840
Last I checked, they weren't married yet

1002
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:15,340
I really have something to tell you

1003
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:16,970
Why not put that back to where it should be?

1004
01:01:17,050 --> 01:01:20,180
So much food today?
Is there some offering to the gods?

1005
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:22,150
No, since your mum came back

1006
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:24,240
we haven't had a sumptuous meal

1007
01:01:24,390 --> 01:01:25,860
Thanks to you, mom

1008
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,220
Come let's dig in

1009
01:01:27,330 --> 01:01:28,660
Let's dig in

1010
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:51,510
What did you want to say just now?

1011
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:53,680
Nothing

1012
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:57,240
I feel like we're a family

1013
01:01:57,320 --> 01:02:00,190
What's wrong with you?
We really are a family okay

1014
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:02,860
By the way, when did you marry my daughter,
may I ask?

1015
01:02:02,930 --> 01:02:04,900
Last night

1016
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:06,660
You marry my daughter in my room?

1017
01:02:34,190 --> 01:02:35,780
So handsome

1018
01:02:40,130 --> 01:02:41,290
Hubby

1019
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:44,500
Am I interrupting your kungfu practice?

1020
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:50,930
Are you sure this is related to…mahjong?

1021
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:57,640
Here it comes

1022
01:02:57,720 --> 01:02:59,340
I can feel it

1023
01:03:04,290 --> 01:03:07,920
Since you left, I…

1024
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:13,330
- You haven't done "it" for 20 years? - Yes

1025
01:03:14,230 --> 01:03:16,460
I've practised the Legendary Mahjong Kungfu
for quite some time now

1026
01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:18,470
You guys are practising mahjong with me today

1027
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:21,530
I was afraid after not using it for so long,
it will…

1028
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:23,830
That's why I…

1029
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:37,580
Are you waiting for the Six and
Nine Character tiles?

1030
01:03:40,790 --> 01:03:42,760
You need a single Three Character tile

1031
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:46,850
You want the Six and Nine
Circles tiles, right?

1032
01:03:49,730 --> 01:03:51,030
How do you know?

1033
01:03:51,140 --> 01:03:54,000
You won't feel much in the beginning

1034
01:03:54,070 --> 01:03:57,010
But after 49 practice sessions

1035
01:03:57,070 --> 01:03:59,870
Your carnal desire

1036
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:03,040
will explode from within

1037
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:06,980
How does it feel like?

1038
01:04:07,050 --> 01:04:08,680
It feels like someone opened the zoo gates

1039
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:10,480
and all the elephants charging out

1040
01:04:29,770 --> 01:04:30,800
Boss, don't…

1041
01:04:32,380 --> 01:04:33,810
Boss, I'm warning you I'm very experienced

1042
01:04:35,310 --> 01:04:37,080
Once you start, I won't stop

1043
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:48,290
What are you doing?

1044
01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:05,270
- Hey - You old and cheap woman

1045
01:05:05,380 --> 01:05:07,570
Why don't you dig a hole and bury yourself

1046
01:05:07,650 --> 01:05:09,170
Don't let me see you again

1047
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:10,770
Sorry, boss

1048
01:05:10,850 --> 01:05:12,410
I was about to call you

1049
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:15,710
The kungfu that Ah Fatt has been practising
isn't for mahjong

1050
01:05:15,790 --> 01:05:19,220
- It's for his little brother, right? - Yes

1051
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:21,620
You might as well tell me after my "little
brother" is injured from overexertion?

1052
01:05:22,860 --> 01:05:26,020
If you can't make Pak Chong Fatt
join the championships

1053
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:28,060
I'll sell you to Ethiopia

1054
01:05:28,130 --> 01:05:29,570
As for the gambling debts you owe me

1055
01:05:29,630 --> 01:05:33,500
I'll cut your fingers off one by one

1056
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:34,760
That's all

1057
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:40,840
Wong Tin Ba I shall remind you again

1058
01:05:40,950 --> 01:05:42,780
Don't say I'm long-winded

1059
01:05:42,850 --> 01:05:45,410
Your 10-year good fortune is coming to an end

1060
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:47,610
If you want good fortune for another 10 years

1061
01:05:47,690 --> 01:05:51,850
You must defeat Pak Chong Fatt
at the championships this year

1062
01:05:52,820 --> 01:05:57,090
You're not just long-winded,
you're ridiculously long-winded

1063
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:58,960
Can you turn on the heater now?

1064
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:10,440
Don't tell me these vicious-looking people

1065
01:06:10,510 --> 01:06:12,500
are here for my yong tau foo so early?

1066
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:16,940
- Hubby - Dear

1067
01:06:20,550 --> 01:06:22,350
It wasn't easy finding mum back with us

1068
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:24,440
and now she's taken away from us again

1069
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:26,960
This won't do, I must look for my mum

1070
01:06:27,390 --> 01:06:28,220
If it's a kidnap

1071
01:06:28,330 --> 01:06:29,880
why haven't we received any calls yet?

1072
01:06:37,270 --> 01:06:39,500
- Help - Ramona?

1073
01:06:40,700 --> 01:06:42,470
You recognise your wife's voice, right?

1074
01:06:43,010 --> 01:06:44,500
- What do you want? - So cruel

1075
01:06:44,580 --> 01:06:45,940
Very simple, If I see you

1076
01:06:46,010 --> 01:06:49,040
as one of the players in the
World Mahjong Championship

1077
01:06:49,580 --> 01:06:50,910
you'll see her

1078
01:06:51,020 --> 01:06:52,380
If I don't see you then

1079
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:54,140
you won't see her for the rest of your life

1080
01:06:54,350 --> 01:06:56,980
- Help - Ramona?

1081
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:02,730
- So? - Yeah, what now?

1082
01:07:05,630 --> 01:07:08,660
Brother Fatt is finally going back
to the mahjong table

1083
01:07:08,730 --> 01:07:10,560
Let's welcome back Brother Fatt

1084
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:14,370
I'm very proud to be able to practise
and play with you

1085
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:16,700
I don't know why I'm very anxious suddenly

1086
01:07:16,770 --> 01:07:20,340
Why? Ah Fatt, we're here to practise with you

1087
01:07:21,810 --> 01:07:23,710
According to the module I've designed

1088
01:07:23,780 --> 01:07:25,610
The first session should be…

1089
01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:27,340
Drawing tiles

1090
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:28,890
Everybody draw your own tiles please

1091
01:07:28,950 --> 01:07:31,080
Draw the Thirteen Wonders
in the shortest time possible

1092
01:07:31,190 --> 01:07:33,120
You can't look at the tiles while drawing

1093
01:07:56,150 --> 01:07:59,050
- Is this the correct way? - You're good

1094
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:01,020
Next, let's practise how to tabulate points

1095
01:08:01,090 --> 01:08:03,580
Tell me the points the
moment I reveal my hand

1096
01:08:03,650 --> 01:08:06,280
These are the initial tiles of a dealer

1097
01:08:06,390 --> 01:08:08,420
That's Four Small Blessings, totals 13 points

1098
01:08:08,490 --> 01:08:10,460
No, it's a so a Mixed Pure Hand,
you've got to add 3 points

1099
01:08:10,530 --> 01:08:11,790
So the total should be 16 points

1100
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:13,300
- That's a lot of "fun" - No

1101
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:14,800
If it's a dealers initial hand
it's a Heavenly Hand

1102
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:17,560
A Heavenly, Mixed Pure Hand
with Four Small Blessings is 29 points

1103
01:08:17,630 --> 01:08:19,570
What about this one?

1104
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:29,540
Four Large Blessings 13 points
Mixed Pure Hand 3 points

1105
01:08:29,610 --> 01:08:30,600
Triplets Hand 3 points

1106
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:32,810
including the flowers is a total of 20 points

1107
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:35,950
Excellent

1108
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:38,650
How many points are there in this one?

1109
01:08:39,690 --> 01:08:42,320
Hold on, give us some time

1110
01:08:42,430 --> 01:08:46,520
This hand s neither here nor there

1111
01:08:46,630 --> 01:08:48,760
Obviously it's a Chicken Hand

1112
01:08:48,830 --> 01:08:50,270
Genius

1113
01:08:50,330 --> 01:08:52,300
- You're a gambling genius - My idol

1114
01:08:52,370 --> 01:08:55,130
Don't be so cliche,
we're learning from one another

1115
01:08:55,210 --> 01:08:57,870
I don't think you need to
practise the basics anymore

1116
01:08:57,980 --> 01:08:59,770
Why don't we go straight into competition

1117
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:01,170
Sure

1118
01:09:04,010 --> 01:09:05,500
I'm so nervous

1119
01:09:05,580 --> 01:09:07,110
Hold it

1120
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:09,980
I've never been this nervous playing mahjong
in the past decades

1121
01:09:10,050 --> 01:09:13,050
I'm a little apprehensive about playing
against my master today

1122
01:09:27,070 --> 01:09:31,170
- Dad - Brother Fatt

1123
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:32,270
What's the matter with you?

1124
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:39,750
- Dad - How are you feeling?

1125
01:09:41,850 --> 01:09:43,410
- Lie down - Thanks

1126
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:46,720
It's no big deal

1127
01:09:46,790 --> 01:09:48,490
But I think I can t go to the competition

1128
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:50,030
Why?

1129
01:09:50,090 --> 01:09:52,990
You were killing it in the beginning

1130
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:54,930
What happened?

1131
01:09:55,230 --> 01:09:56,530
I wanted to win

1132
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:57,830
This is what happens when
you're too eager to win

1133
01:09:58,400 --> 01:09:59,560
That's why I

1134
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:01,970
pulled out of the second world championships

1135
01:10:03,110 --> 01:10:05,010
I don't play to win

1136
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:08,940
With this mentality

1137
01:10:09,050 --> 01:10:10,670
how am I to defeat Wong Tin Ba?

1138
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:27,550
Let's begin the day

1139
01:10:34,470 --> 01:10:37,030
Where are you going so early?

1140
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:39,410
Sassy

1141
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:53,620
Ah Fatt

1142
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:56,050
Letter for you from Sassy

1143
01:11:01,770 --> 01:11:03,930
I'm eloping with Wayne Yang

1144
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,590
Don't worry, it's just for a few days

1145
01:11:05,670 --> 01:11:07,330
We'll be home once we've had enough fun

1146
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:10,930
So this is Sassy's final move

1147
01:11:11,010 --> 01:11:15,240
Ah Fatt, you've raised a daughter
with such fine character

1148
01:11:59,660 --> 01:12:00,850
Ah Fatt

1149
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:03,950
I knew you'd come back to find me

1150
01:12:04,030 --> 01:12:07,090
I know Ah You all too well

1151
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:09,000
Since the day I announced your victory

1152
01:12:09,070 --> 01:12:11,190
I knew he'd never let it go so easily

1153
01:12:11,270 --> 01:12:14,470
But I'm traveling the word now

1154
01:12:14,540 --> 01:12:17,940
You need to settle your own problems

1155
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:21,010
A word of advice before I leave

1156
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:23,410
You don't have much weaknesses

1157
01:12:23,510 --> 01:12:25,480
Except you think too much

1158
01:12:25,750 --> 01:12:27,380
If you weren't like that

1159
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:30,110
Ramona probably wouldn't have left

1160
01:12:30,190 --> 01:12:33,520
Your life would've been complete

1161
01:12:33,590 --> 01:12:34,990
Do you remember?

1162
01:12:35,060 --> 01:12:39,120
I told you, the true spirit
of playing mahjong

1163
01:12:41,260 --> 01:12:43,660
The tiles don't determine winning or losing

1164
01:12:43,730 --> 01:12:45,570
The player does

1165
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:48,160
The tiles are lifeless, but the player isn't

1166
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:51,070
Playing mahjong is like learning
how to be a good person

1167
01:12:51,170 --> 01:12:55,700
If you get too caught up in winning or losing

1168
01:12:55,780 --> 01:12:57,540
even if you have the best hand,
it'll a I be in vain

1169
01:12:57,610 --> 01:12:59,710
- One Cirle - Game

1170
01:12:59,980 --> 01:13:02,180
The Three Great Scholars,
Triplets, Mixed Pure Hand

1171
01:13:08,060 --> 01:13:08,960
Green Dragon

1172
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:10,550
- You're so smart - Game

1173
01:13:10,630 --> 01:13:13,560
You're not affected by the outcome anymore

1174
01:13:13,630 --> 01:13:16,120
How can you ever be defeated?

1175
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:20,700
It's only after 20 years

1176
01:13:20,770 --> 01:13:22,930
that I began to understand this saying

1177
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:25,370
Am I slow?

1178
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:27,610
Luckily It's still in time

1179
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:02,410
You really want to do this yourself?

1180
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:06,580
I have my dad's genes,
sure y I won't come in last

1181
01:14:06,650 --> 01:14:08,120
And the most important thing is

1182
01:14:08,190 --> 01:14:09,240
I can take the opportunity to look for my mom

1183
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:09,790
Ms Deedee Zhang

1184
01:14:09,850 --> 01:14:12,550
Welcome to the King of Mahjong Championships

1185
01:14:12,620 --> 01:14:14,090
- It's her? - You know each other?

1186
01:14:14,590 --> 01:14:15,820
I've seen her before

1187
01:14:17,690 --> 01:14:20,720
We meet again, isn't that fate?

1188
01:14:21,630 --> 01:14:24,460
So that's your type

1189
01:14:24,530 --> 01:14:27,060
What type? What do you mean by that?

1190
01:14:27,140 --> 01:14:28,830
Why would you know someone like that?

1191
01:14:30,370 --> 01:14:31,200
That night inbed

1192
01:14:31,310 --> 01:14:34,370
you said you would love me forever

1193
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:38,480
Since It's none of your business

1194
01:14:38,550 --> 01:14:39,610
are you still trying to be a hero?

1195
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:42,310
I'll whoop your ass Miss Third Party

1196
01:14:42,390 --> 01:14:44,350
Miss, don't be too sad

1197
01:14:44,420 --> 01:14:45,290
Sad?

1198
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:47,620
I'm more than thrilled to see them fall apart

1199
01:14:47,790 --> 01:14:50,320
That's how she ruined a couple the other day

1200
01:14:50,390 --> 01:14:52,360
Just because she couldn't stand them

1201
01:14:58,740 --> 01:15:01,330
I'm the type that he likes

1202
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:04,460
and he's been devoted to me all these years

1203
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:06,910
What? Are you jealous?

1204
01:15:07,010 --> 01:15:11,310
Why are you talking to
these people in public?

1205
01:15:11,380 --> 01:15:12,850
Deedee Zhang

1206
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:15,810
Who are you? And who are they?

1207
01:15:15,890 --> 01:15:17,350
Aren't you afraid of
diminishing your own status?

1208
01:15:27,230 --> 01:15:30,630
Why? Where did your arrogance go?

1209
01:15:30,870 --> 01:15:32,330
Initially there was just Wong Tin Ba

1210
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:35,130
Now there's another Deedee Zhang
how are we going to win?

1211
01:15:35,210 --> 01:15:36,600
Are you nuts

1212
01:15:36,710 --> 01:15:37,800
Why are you putting

1213
01:15:37,870 --> 01:15:39,240
your own team down?

1214
01:15:39,410 --> 01:15:40,810
Dad, what are you doing?

1215
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:42,570
I want to come and play mahjong here

1216
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:44,670
Why are you dressed like that here?

1217
01:15:45,350 --> 01:15:48,280
I'm a man how can I
let my daughter battle this alone

1218
01:15:48,390 --> 01:15:50,250
Brother Fatt, you really are my idol

1219
01:15:50,350 --> 01:15:51,180
Of course

1220
01:15:51,450 --> 01:15:52,790
I thought you had no confidence?

1221
01:15:52,890 --> 01:15:53,880
Initially I didn't

1222
01:15:54,020 --> 01:15:56,750
Now do, or how else do we save your mum?

1223
01:15:57,660 --> 01:15:58,490
Dad

1224
01:15:59,260 --> 01:16:00,420
It's good that you're conf dent

1225
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:04,670
But, the way you're dressed…

1226
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:06,630
- I think it looks good - No way

1227
01:16:07,140 --> 01:16:09,770
The first ever King of
Mahjong must look the part

1228
01:16:11,170 --> 01:16:12,330
We still have time

1229
01:16:13,410 --> 01:16:15,000
- Let's go - Where to?

1230
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:18,670
Not only do I want to win this competition

1231
01:16:19,220 --> 01:16:21,650
I want the two of you to make the finals
no matter what it takes

1232
01:16:21,950 --> 01:16:24,720
I want Pak Chong Fatt to be disgraced
in the mahjong world

1233
01:16:24,790 --> 01:16:26,760
I want him to hit rock bottom

1234
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:28,820
Yes

1235
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:33,550
Do you understand?

1236
01:16:35,430 --> 01:16:36,630
Yes

1237
01:16:37,830 --> 01:16:40,000
I've waited for this for 20 years

1238
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:42,030
I'll finally have my vengeance

1239
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:02,990
Hello everyone

1240
01:17:03,060 --> 01:17:06,320
Welcome to the 12th King of Mahjong
World Championship

1241
01:17:06,430 --> 01:17:10,300
- I'm your emcee, Mushroom - I'm Sea Cucumber

1242
01:17:10,370 --> 01:17:12,860
Not only do we have the
best of the best players this year

1243
01:17:12,970 --> 01:17:15,960
we also have a huge
surprise for everyone today

1244
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:17,770
We have invited an

1245
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:21,300
incredibly unexpected special guest

1246
01:17:21,510 --> 01:17:24,840
The first ever King of Mahjong

1247
01:17:24,950 --> 01:17:27,470
Pak Chong Fatt

1248
01:17:33,390 --> 01:17:35,590
Mr Pak Chong Fatt,
you're the first ever King of Mahjong

1249
01:17:35,660 --> 01:17:36,630
Is Wong Tin Ba the reason

1250
01:17:36,690 --> 01:17:37,920
you came out of retirement?

1251
01:17:37,990 --> 01:17:39,960
Is it because no one's been able to
defeat him in the past 10 years?

1252
01:17:40,030 --> 01:17:41,120
And you think you can?

1253
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:42,820
Are you confident of beating him?

1254
01:17:43,030 --> 01:17:44,900
To be honest, in terms of playing mahjong

1255
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:48,200
Can you not throw it anymore?

1256
01:17:48,310 --> 01:17:49,600
It looks cool, master

1257
01:17:49,670 --> 01:17:51,640
I know, but it hurts

1258
01:17:51,710 --> 01:17:52,570
Thank you

1259
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:55,700
Mahjong is a form of entertainment

1260
01:17:55,810 --> 01:17:58,980
If you pay to win, it loses its meaning

1261
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:05,590
Ah Fatt, we're here to support you and Sassy

1262
01:18:05,690 --> 01:18:07,820
- Give it your best shot - You can do it

1263
01:18:07,890 --> 01:18:08,690
Thank you

1264
01:18:09,030 --> 01:18:10,080
Where's Ah Lian?

1265
01:18:10,190 --> 01:18:13,060
She's busy doing plastic surgery

1266
01:18:13,130 --> 01:18:15,560
Do you think I need plastic surgery as well?

1267
01:18:16,530 --> 01:18:17,900
Absolutely

1268
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:20,030
Let's play mahjong first

1269
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:23,670
Will the inaugural King
of Mahjong pit against

1270
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:25,260
the King of Mahjong of 10 consecutive years?

1271
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:26,840
Today's competition is more exciting
than ever before

1272
01:18:26,910 --> 01:18:29,500
Relax, just relax

1273
01:18:29,710 --> 01:18:30,680
Okay

1274
01:18:30,750 --> 01:18:32,440
This is so hot, what should I do?

1275
01:18:32,850 --> 01:18:33,510
Just a little while more

1276
01:18:33,580 --> 01:18:34,570
I can't take it anymore

1277
01:18:38,490 --> 01:18:41,580
Give it your best shot, Ah Fatt

1278
01:18:41,660 --> 01:18:42,820
We're right behind you

1279
01:18:42,930 --> 01:18:44,420
Thanks

1280
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:51,330
I didn't want to wear this coat,
it was my daughter's idea

1281
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:53,530
- Understood - Good

1282
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:02,840
And now, ladies and gentlemen

1283
01:19:02,910 --> 01:19:06,910
The champion for 10 years
in a row, Wong Tin Ba

1284
01:19:06,980 --> 01:19:09,040
And his daughter, Deedee Zhang

1285
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:12,520
As well as his disciple, Icy

1286
01:19:14,420 --> 01:19:15,120
Mr. Wong Tin Ba

1287
01:19:15,230 --> 01:19:17,390
are you confident of reigning the throne?

1288
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:19,720
Are you conf dent of
defeating Pak Chong Fatt?

1289
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:22,290
Don't go, we still have questions for you

1290
01:19:24,970 --> 01:19:26,940
Do you think you look
good in that garbage bag?

1291
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:28,530
Hello

1292
01:19:39,150 --> 01:19:41,480
That's him, don't take him seriously

1293
01:19:50,890 --> 01:19:52,090
As always

1294
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:55,220
In the preliminary round,
the first contestants to score 20 points

1295
01:19:55,300 --> 01:19:58,170
will have their bulbs lit up
each bulb represents 2 points

1296
01:19:58,270 --> 01:19:59,830
They will then proceed to the next round

1297
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:01,840
This process shall be repeated
until we reach the semi-finals

1298
01:20:01,940 --> 01:20:04,570
If no one manages to get all their bulbs lit

1299
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:06,300
The highest scorer will
proceed to the next round

1300
01:20:06,380 --> 01:20:09,570
Three winners from the semi-finals

1301
01:20:09,650 --> 01:20:12,310
Will get to challenge our
10-year champion for the title

1302
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:16,820
Let's kick off this year s
King of Mahjong World Championship

1303
01:20:31,700 --> 01:20:32,960
Heavenly Hand

1304
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:34,560
Are you kidding me?

1305
01:20:35,540 --> 01:20:38,510
First to qualify for the
semi-finals is Ms Icy

1306
01:20:42,750 --> 01:20:44,270
Game, Earthly Hand

1307
01:20:45,150 --> 01:20:47,640
Second contestant to advance to the
semi-finals, the daughter of Wong Tin Ba

1308
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:48,480
Deedee Zhang

1309
01:20:48,550 --> 01:20:49,310
Congratulations

1310
01:20:49,390 --> 01:20:51,320
Will the father and daughter

1311
01:20:51,390 --> 01:20:52,510
be challenging each other for the title?

1312
01:20:52,590 --> 01:20:54,850
Let's keep our eyes peeled

1313
01:20:57,360 --> 01:21:02,130
Four Large Blessings, Concealed,
Mixed Pure Hand, All Terminal
Three Hidden Treasure

1314
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:07,140
Pak Chong Fatt's daughter
also made it into the semi-finals

1315
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:09,970
- Congratulations Ms Sassy Bai - Sassy won

1316
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:12,030
Come have a seat, Sassy

1317
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:14,600
You were great

1318
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:26,920
It's already the final round

1319
01:21:27,020 --> 01:21:28,580
Do you think Brother Fatt
will get full lights

1320
01:21:28,690 --> 01:21:30,090
That doesn't matter

1321
01:21:30,190 --> 01:21:32,060
What's important is to win

1322
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:42,830
North Wind

1323
01:21:49,410 --> 01:21:50,880
Pong

1324
01:21:50,950 --> 01:21:53,440
Discarding a character
tile to lure my North Wind

1325
01:21:53,550 --> 01:21:56,040
Trying to draw a snake out of its hole

1326
01:21:57,820 --> 01:21:59,250
I can see through that

1327
01:22:02,230 --> 01:22:03,210
North Wind

1328
01:22:05,630 --> 01:22:07,060
Win

1329
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:08,900
What a fine round

1330
01:22:08,970 --> 01:22:11,230
What a move by Pak Chong Fatt

1331
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:13,460
Making the semi-finals with the highest score

1332
01:22:13,540 --> 01:22:14,940
He won by a hair's breadth

1333
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,670
Ah Fatt, you were awesome

1334
01:22:16,770 --> 01:22:18,240
You's re so good

1335
01:22:19,510 --> 01:22:22,070
It wasn't a landslide win,
but you have such good skills

1336
01:22:22,150 --> 01:22:25,050
And what a character, I am deeply humbled

1337
01:22:25,110 --> 01:22:26,510
It's just a game

1338
01:22:27,620 --> 01:22:29,780
It's just a game

1339
01:22:30,450 --> 01:22:31,940
Pak Chong Fatt

1340
01:22:32,020 --> 01:22:35,180
You purposely discarded a tile
for the player with the lowest score

1341
01:22:35,490 --> 01:22:36,790
Good

1342
01:22:38,190 --> 01:22:41,630
A hypocrite, but I like

1343
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:01,810
After the preliminary qualifying matches

1344
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:04,610
The semi-finals will commence now

1345
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:13,820
- East Wind - I'll take that

1346
01:23:16,870 --> 01:23:18,360
Chicken Hand

1347
01:23:20,700 --> 01:23:22,030
- Five Bamboos - That's right

1348
01:23:22,140 --> 01:23:24,700
Take the in-betweens

1349
01:23:25,610 --> 01:23:28,040
- Chicken Hand again

1350
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:31,270
- East Wind - I'll take that

1351
01:23:32,020 --> 01:23:34,350
East Wind two points

1352
01:23:35,050 --> 01:23:37,180
Can he win like that?

1353
01:23:37,250 --> 01:23:39,020
It's a race between the hare and the turtle

1354
01:23:39,090 --> 01:23:41,990
This move is called stuffing yourself up

1355
01:23:42,060 --> 01:23:45,260
A few small wins make for a big win

1356
01:23:47,630 --> 01:23:48,860
- One Bamboo - I'll take that

1357
01:23:49,470 --> 01:23:50,560
Chicken Hand

1358
01:23:53,900 --> 01:23:57,630
Mahjong, Self-Draw three points, sorry

1359
01:23:57,870 --> 01:23:59,640
As expected

1360
01:23:59,710 --> 01:24:01,070
See I was right

1361
01:24:01,140 --> 01:24:03,370
- the turtle won - Mr Pak
Chong Fatt is the first

1362
01:24:03,450 --> 01:24:06,640
- to make it to the finals - Congratulations

1363
01:24:06,850 --> 01:24:11,340
Next, we shall witness
the battle of the century

1364
01:24:17,390 --> 01:24:18,520
You can do it

1365
01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:37,770
Look

1366
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:41,370
She's got so many flower tiles

1367
01:24:41,450 --> 01:24:44,820
If she wins this round, it's a lot of points

1368
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:46,390
If she makes it into the finals

1369
01:24:46,460 --> 01:24:49,620
She will be working against
Brother Fatt for Wong Tin Ba

1370
01:24:51,990 --> 01:24:58,900
I'll Jinx that.. jinx…

1371
01:24:58,970 --> 01:25:01,840
Self-Draw win, Pure Honour Hand,
Three Great Scholars

1372
01:25:01,940 --> 01:25:04,100
We jinxed the wrong one

1373
01:25:04,170 --> 01:25:05,370
How many points is that?

1374
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:07,770
A lot, for sure

1375
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:10,140
Our second finalist s Ms Icy

1376
01:25:10,250 --> 01:25:11,440
Congratulations

1377
01:25:14,780 --> 01:25:16,680
Who will be the final player

1378
01:25:16,790 --> 01:25:18,120
in the finals?

1379
01:25:19,390 --> 01:25:21,080
So nerve-wracking

1380
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:25,890
But if you look at Sassy Bails and
Deedee Zhang's table

1381
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:29,360
this is an inverse duel between their fathers

1382
01:25:32,670 --> 01:25:33,760
Brother Fatt

1383
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:35,770
Ah Fatt

1384
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:47,280
Go

1385
01:25:50,390 --> 01:25:52,010
Oh, what a klutz, Deedee Zhang

1386
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:54,850
She accidentally revealed a tile
and is now disadvantaged

1387
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:56,620
Luckily it's just a Formed Meld

1388
01:25:56,690 --> 01:25:58,130
Two Circles, Open Kong

1389
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:01,530
Robbing the Kong, win

1390
01:26:04,670 --> 01:26:06,430
That's a Trick Hand

1391
01:26:06,570 --> 01:26:08,000
You were waiting for the Two Circles,
Five Circles and Eight Circles tiles

1392
01:26:08,070 --> 01:26:10,100
You passed up that Eight Circles just now,
and you didn't draw

1393
01:26:10,170 --> 01:26:11,440
How can you take the Two Circles now?

1394
01:26:11,510 --> 01:26:13,500
Right, according to the rules

1395
01:26:13,580 --> 01:26:15,480
she can't take this tile

1396
01:26:15,550 --> 01:26:18,640
But she's already revealed her hand,
so it's considered a Trick Hand

1397
01:26:18,710 --> 01:26:20,710
- Yes - We are at the last round

1398
01:26:20,820 --> 01:26:23,050
and it's a tie between
Deedee Zhang and Sassy Ba

1399
01:26:23,150 --> 01:26:24,980
Deedee's Trick Hand causes her

1400
01:26:25,050 --> 01:26:27,420
loss to Sassy by a hair's breadth

1401
01:26:30,430 --> 01:26:31,790
Sassy

1402
01:26:31,860 --> 01:26:34,520
That's right, she won, that's my daughter

1403
01:26:45,740 --> 01:26:47,210
Don't you remember what I've taught you?

1404
01:26:49,550 --> 01:26:51,040
Do you have polio?

1405
01:26:51,580 --> 01:26:53,880
You can't even hold on
to an Eight Circles tile

1406
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:57,250
This is a mistake only an idiot will make

1407
01:26:58,190 --> 01:27:00,750
It's my mistake, but I didn't mean it

1408
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:03,390
It's not whether you meant it or not

1409
01:27:03,460 --> 01:27:05,720
It's about how I'm going to
face the public from now on

1410
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:08,490
You're my daughter, Deedee Zhang

1411
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:10,690
I don't want you to be
number one in anything else

1412
01:27:10,770 --> 01:27:13,530
I only want you to be number one in mahjong

1413
01:27:14,370 --> 01:27:17,070
Since I'm such an embarassment
to you, I'll leave

1414
01:27:17,410 --> 01:27:18,900
You're leaving…

1415
01:27:18,980 --> 01:27:21,810
Who's gonna take photo
with me later when I win?

1416
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:25,170
You'd ruin my perfect father image

1417
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:29,910
If she really leaves

1418
01:27:29,990 --> 01:27:33,110
Cancel all her credit cards for me

1419
01:27:36,890 --> 01:27:39,790
The most exciting match
and the best of the best

1420
01:27:39,860 --> 01:27:42,260
is unfolding right before us

1421
01:27:42,330 --> 01:27:47,200
The finals of this year's
King of Mahjong Championship starts now

1422
01:27:55,110 --> 01:27:56,510
What's the matter?

1423
01:27:56,610 --> 01:27:59,140
- Are you nervous? - A little

1424
01:27:59,220 --> 01:28:01,740
Are you worried that you
won't draw a good hand?

1425
01:28:01,820 --> 01:28:04,120
Sometimes I can't get good ingredients
from the market

1426
01:28:04,190 --> 01:28:05,650
but I still have to cook

1427
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:07,750
You can do it if you put your heart into it

1428
01:28:07,820 --> 01:28:09,590
Chicken Hand is also considered a win

1429
01:28:09,660 --> 01:28:12,130
Don't be afraid of losing just do it

1430
01:28:19,670 --> 01:28:20,690
Brother

1431
01:28:21,940 --> 01:28:23,870
Don't call me that

1432
01:28:24,210 --> 01:28:27,640
From now on, you'll have to call me
the King of Mahjong for 11 consecutive years

1433
01:28:28,210 --> 01:28:31,200
Did you eat a lot of
garlic? Your mouth stinks

1434
01:28:31,310 --> 01:28:32,750
He does have a better chance

1435
01:28:32,820 --> 01:28:34,610
Cut the crap

1436
01:28:34,680 --> 01:28:37,450
- I'll finish you off in
one round - Of course

1437
01:28:52,170 --> 01:28:55,600
Let's see what you guys have in hand

1438
01:28:55,670 --> 01:28:56,870
Red Dragon

1439
01:28:56,940 --> 01:28:58,240
Pong

1440
01:29:05,550 --> 01:29:07,210
Let's move in for the kill then

1441
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:08,580
Red Dragon

1442
01:29:14,990 --> 01:29:17,290
- Green Dragon - Pong

1443
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:28,660
I'll just follow your lead, Green Dragon

1444
01:29:28,740 --> 01:29:29,900
Why did you do that?

1445
01:29:30,010 --> 01:29:32,770
I told you before, learn how to
be a good person before learning mahjong

1446
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:36,780
People might think you're talking about them

1447
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:40,250
This is your elder show some respect

1448
01:29:40,350 --> 01:29:42,480
That's right, you need to respect your elders

1449
01:29:42,550 --> 01:29:44,310
Stop chiding your daughter

1450
01:29:44,390 --> 01:29:46,220
She's just following the bad example you set

1451
01:29:46,290 --> 01:29:49,050
It's genetics

1452
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:52,750
You already have both Green and Red Dragons

1453
01:29:52,860 --> 01:29:54,330
Are you going to get the White Dragon too

1454
01:29:54,430 --> 01:29:56,560
That would be such a coincidence

1455
01:29:56,630 --> 01:29:57,460
Pong

1456
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:00,370
Why are you so careless?

1457
01:30:00,440 --> 01:30:02,600
That's a Three Great
Scholars you just gave away

1458
01:30:02,710 --> 01:30:03,690
And you asked me to show him respect?

1459
01:30:03,770 --> 01:30:05,900
How would I know he has all three dragons?

1460
01:30:05,980 --> 01:30:08,100
And you know how much I hate those tiles

1461
01:30:10,310 --> 01:30:11,370
Nine Bamboos

1462
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:16,040
Nine Bamboos

1463
01:30:17,750 --> 01:30:19,450
Nothing from you?

1464
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:20,680
Watch me then

1465
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:23,930
East Wind

1466
01:30:23,990 --> 01:30:25,050
Pong East Wind

1467
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,590
I have to be smart about this

1468
01:30:28,660 --> 01:30:29,930
I have to let dad Pong

1469
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:32,160
- One Circle - Pong

1470
01:30:35,740 --> 01:30:36,570
South Wind

1471
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:37,900
Pong South Wind

1472
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:41,470
- Two Circles - Pong

1473
01:30:43,180 --> 01:30:44,480
West Wind

1474
01:30:44,580 --> 01:30:45,950
Pong West Wind

1475
01:30:47,450 --> 01:30:50,580
You'll have to cover all losses if you
were to gift her a Four Large Blessings

1476
01:30:50,650 --> 01:30:51,590
Three Circles

1477
01:30:51,650 --> 01:30:54,490
Even the blind could tell
you can't discard a North Wind tile now

1478
01:30:56,990 --> 01:30:58,860
Icy, prepare to Pong

1479
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:00,590
How would you know?

1480
01:31:00,660 --> 01:31:03,130
I'm the King of Mahjong

1481
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:04,760
I'll shout it out for you

1482
01:31:04,830 --> 01:31:06,460
Pong Two Character

1483
01:31:10,870 --> 01:31:13,000
She only needs another tile to win

1484
01:31:14,680 --> 01:31:16,510
I can't discard the North Wind

1485
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:20,810
- Three Bamboos - I'll take that

1486
01:31:21,720 --> 01:31:24,050
How? It should be hers, not yours

1487
01:31:24,150 --> 01:31:25,710
Don't you know the rules?

1488
01:31:25,820 --> 01:31:28,790
Take it, even though it's nothing much

1489
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:30,630
Four Small Blessings

1490
01:31:32,230 --> 01:31:32,960
Sassy

1491
01:31:33,030 --> 01:31:34,220
Winning (eat) with a Four
Small Blessings hand

1492
01:31:34,330 --> 01:31:37,270
She's devouring herself

1493
01:31:38,570 --> 01:31:39,800
Are you playing or is she playing?

1494
01:31:39,870 --> 01:31:42,340
If you're playing for real ,
she should be on her own

1495
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:44,800
If you were to team up and bully her

1496
01:31:44,870 --> 01:31:46,310
Why don't you two share a hand

1497
01:31:47,510 --> 01:31:50,170
Boss can't defeat them with a single bow

1498
01:31:50,250 --> 01:31:52,810
That's a first in 10 years

1499
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:55,910
Pak Chong Fatt is really something

1500
01:31:56,020 --> 01:31:57,450
What the…

1501
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:00,480
I'm letting you win this round

1502
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:03,150
since you're not so bright

1503
01:32:03,590 --> 01:32:05,690
Let's break for 15 minutes and resume later

1504
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:08,160
Don't take heart, thats how he is

1505
01:32:11,070 --> 01:32:13,400
There will be a 15-minute
interval see you later

1506
01:32:13,470 --> 01:32:14,870
See you later

1507
01:32:17,870 --> 01:32:19,740
I realised that you're rather fidgety today

1508
01:32:19,810 --> 01:32:22,440
You'll raise your chest when you
hold big tiles, that's not good

1509
01:32:22,550 --> 01:32:24,410
Be more mindful of it

1510
01:32:24,510 --> 01:32:25,840
Daughter of Wong Tin Ba

1511
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:28,280
Come with me, I have something to show you

1512
01:32:30,420 --> 01:32:31,820
Your father said

1513
01:32:32,690 --> 01:32:34,620
What kind of wife did Ah You marry

1514
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:36,920
for him to have a such a tanned
and skinny daughter

1515
01:32:37,830 --> 01:32:39,490
Pak Chong Fatt is here for the championship

1516
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:41,260
I have completed my
mission, where's my money?

1517
01:32:43,170 --> 01:32:45,030
I want it now

1518
01:32:46,940 --> 01:32:48,630
So little?

1519
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,230
I've settled your gambling debts

1520
01:32:50,310 --> 01:32:52,930
Food and accommodation at
my house cost money, too

1521
01:32:53,410 --> 01:32:55,040
- What a cheapskate - Beat it

1522
01:32:57,450 --> 01:32:59,570
You couldn't discard the North Wind tile,
that's right

1523
01:32:59,650 --> 01:33:02,580
You couldn't discard any Bamboo
tiles as well, yet you did

1524
01:33:05,550 --> 01:33:07,580
So everything was a lie

1525
01:33:08,990 --> 01:33:10,980
It's not too late to realise that

1526
01:33:12,260 --> 01:33:13,690
You came back to find us

1527
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:15,060
because he paid you to do it

1528
01:33:15,700 --> 01:33:16,720
That's right

1529
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:18,820
I've succeeded in getting him back
into competition

1530
01:33:18,930 --> 01:33:20,090
after all these years

1531
01:33:20,170 --> 01:33:21,640
Of course I'm happy

1532
01:33:21,740 --> 01:33:23,260
Are you?

1533
01:33:23,340 --> 01:33:26,000
Of course who wouldn't
be with all this money?

1534
01:33:34,750 --> 01:33:37,580
What's the matter? Are you questioning me?

1535
01:33:37,650 --> 01:33:39,020
Dad

1536
01:33:39,820 --> 01:33:43,590
Mom's leaving, won't you make her stay?

1537
01:33:43,660 --> 01:33:46,320
Can I?

1538
01:33:46,660 --> 01:33:50,100
Remember to take care of yourself

1539
01:33:50,170 --> 01:33:53,360
Don't open your eyes so big when you're lying

1540
01:33:53,470 --> 01:33:55,300
Don't act cool when you're cheating

1541
01:33:55,370 --> 01:33:56,800
that will give you away

1542
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:01,500
Aren't you mad at me?

1543
01:34:01,580 --> 01:34:04,170
Really?

1544
01:34:04,250 --> 01:34:06,480
I just want you to be happy

1545
01:34:06,550 --> 01:34:09,310
You knew she was lying all along?

1546
01:34:12,550 --> 01:34:15,150
Why didn't you say so?

1547
01:34:18,360 --> 01:34:20,760
Because you would leave again if I did

1548
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:28,270
Wait

1549
01:34:41,220 --> 01:34:42,180
Alright that's enough

1550
01:34:42,250 --> 01:34:43,980
Look, Brother Fatt is not only God of Mahjong

1551
01:34:44,050 --> 01:34:45,650
he's also Casablanca

1552
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:46,480
We're not young anymore

1553
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:48,750
We're here for the competition, cut the drama
will you?

1554
01:34:48,890 --> 01:34:51,360
Mind your own business

1555
01:34:52,460 --> 01:34:54,550
Come on, we're not young anymore

1556
01:34:55,830 --> 01:34:57,230
My beloved daughter

1557
01:34:58,370 --> 01:35:01,000
Mom has wronged you

1558
01:35:01,070 --> 01:35:03,560
The first time I lay my eyes on you

1559
01:35:07,110 --> 01:35:09,670
I knew you were the best thing

1560
01:35:09,750 --> 01:35:11,180
to have ever happened to me

1561
01:35:12,150 --> 01:35:14,240
Can you forgive me?

1562
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:24,420
- Can we proceed with
the game now? - Let's go

1563
01:35:27,060 --> 01:35:30,360
People think they need to be number one

1564
01:35:30,470 --> 01:35:33,800
What they really need is to be loved

1565
01:35:36,910 --> 01:35:38,900
Why isn't my father like that?

1566
01:35:44,450 --> 01:35:47,010
Sorry, excuse me

1567
01:35:47,550 --> 01:35:49,450
- We're here - Ah Fatt

1568
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:50,110
isn't that a good thing?

1569
01:35:50,220 --> 01:35:50,480
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

1570
01:35:50,620 --> 01:35:51,710
Dad, mom, people are watching

1571
01:35:51,790 --> 01:35:53,480
I can't bear to be apart from you

1572
01:35:53,620 --> 01:35:56,090
Dad, mom, let's play mahjong

1573
01:35:56,230 --> 01:35:57,590
- Yes - We have to be apart again

1574
01:35:57,690 --> 01:35:58,750
I'll make this quick

1575
01:35:58,830 --> 01:35:59,920
You'd better,I can't bear for us to be apart

1576
01:36:00,030 --> 01:36:02,290
Be good

1577
01:36:04,730 --> 01:36:06,060
Take care of him

1578
01:36:06,900 --> 01:36:08,770
So handsome

1579
01:36:09,970 --> 01:36:13,270
Pak Chong Fatt, are you a man?

1580
01:36:13,380 --> 01:36:15,310
You're okay with your wife
treating you this way?

1581
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:18,740
What do you know about love

1582
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:21,570
Is there something wrong with your father?

1583
01:36:21,650 --> 01:36:23,480
Let's play

1584
01:36:23,620 --> 01:36:25,810
And look at your wife

1585
01:36:25,950 --> 01:36:28,250
She just took my money

1586
01:36:28,360 --> 01:36:30,760
And now she's on your side cheering you on

1587
01:36:30,860 --> 01:36:32,350
So unprofessional

1588
01:36:32,490 --> 01:36:34,490
No wonder you're married to each other

1589
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:39,600
Shuffle the tiles

1590
01:36:45,410 --> 01:36:46,500

1591
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:48,100

Three Bamboos

1594
01:36:57,150 --> 01:36:58,480
I'll take that

1595
01:37:01,320 --> 01:37:02,020
Eight Circles

1596
01:37:02,160 --> 01:37:03,620
- In-between - I'll take that

1597
01:37:03,730 --> 01:37:07,390
Flowerless, Concealed, Sequence Hand
win with a single Eight Circles, three points

1598
01:37:09,870 --> 01:37:10,990
This is mere luck

1599
01:37:11,100 --> 01:37:13,470
You won't be lucky everyday

1600
01:37:13,770 --> 01:37:14,930
Whatever

1601
01:37:26,850 --> 01:37:28,480
- Nine Character - Pong

1602
01:37:29,890 --> 01:37:31,380

1603
01:37:33,060 --> 01:37:35,180
- Two Circles - I'll take that

1604
01:37:40,900 --> 01:37:42,660
- Three Bamboos - Pong

1605
01:37:48,670 --> 01:37:50,660
- One Bamboo - Something to take again

1606
01:37:55,780 --> 01:37:57,240
Are you nuts?

1607
01:37:58,650 --> 01:38:00,840
All these years you've
been the King of Mahjong

1608
01:38:00,950 --> 01:38:04,010
Your daughter has been unhappy

1609
01:38:04,120 --> 01:38:05,450
Are you happy?

1610
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:10,220
One has polio, one s pea-brained

1611
01:38:10,330 --> 01:38:11,790
Just play

1612
01:38:16,900 --> 01:38:18,870
- Eight Character - Pong

1613
01:38:21,470 --> 01:38:22,870
win

1614
01:38:28,110 --> 01:38:30,040
I am destined to win today

1615
01:38:30,150 --> 01:38:32,670
No matter whose side you're on

1616
01:38:44,060 --> 01:38:46,220
Do you still remember when we were young

1617
01:38:46,330 --> 01:38:49,560
Master told us a story
about the wind and the sun?

1618
01:38:51,100 --> 01:38:52,260
He's been such a dumbass since young

1619
01:38:52,370 --> 01:38:53,460
Six Bamboos

1620
01:39:04,310 --> 01:39:05,340

Three Character

1623
01:39:12,520 --> 01:39:15,650
Dad, he has all the suits

1624
01:39:15,790 --> 01:39:17,920
I'm sure he's building The Thirteen Wonders

1625
01:39:18,030 --> 01:39:21,460
It won't be that easy

1626
01:39:26,370 --> 01:39:29,100
Why would Wong Tin Ba
build The Thirteen Wonders

1627
01:39:29,200 --> 01:39:32,140
The focus should be on the Green Dragon now

1628
01:39:33,740 --> 01:39:34,730
Seven Bamboos

1629
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:40,480
Two Character

1630
01:39:44,290 --> 01:39:47,850
Everything is going so well

1631
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:50,250
Pong

1632
01:40:50,750 --> 01:40:52,950
Don't rush it

1633
01:40:53,060 --> 01:40:56,080
Everyone can tell I'm waiting
for the Green Dragon tile

1634
01:40:56,220 --> 01:40:59,190
Yet you discarded it?
Are you out of your mind?

1635
01:40:59,290 --> 01:41:01,760
Because all you care
about s winning or losing

1636
01:41:09,570 --> 01:41:10,600
Green Dragon

1637
01:41:10,740 --> 01:41:12,540
I should thank you

1638
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:15,870
Because of your ploy, I found my wife

1639
01:41:15,980 --> 01:41:18,450
And my daughter reunited with her mum

1640
01:41:18,580 --> 01:41:20,280
Brother

1641
01:41:20,420 --> 01:41:24,220
This Green Dragon is just a mahjong tile

1642
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:26,310
I'll give it to you if you like

1643
01:41:28,460 --> 01:41:31,620
So we are really poles apart

1644
01:41:33,030 --> 01:41:36,730
It feels as though Pak Chong Fatt
is not a mere human being

1645
01:41:37,300 --> 01:41:38,600
He's like.

1646
01:41:38,730 --> 01:41:41,130
He is…

1647
01:41:41,270 --> 01:41:43,570
Right, that's him

1648
01:41:43,870 --> 01:41:47,240
Wukong, you want the Green Dragon tile?

1649
01:41:47,810 --> 01:41:49,940
I have it

1650
01:41:50,110 --> 01:41:53,310
It always gets in my way,
shall I give it to you?

1651
01:42:00,490 --> 01:42:01,480
Wukong

1652
01:42:01,620 --> 01:42:03,110
You're good at playing mahjong

1653
01:42:03,230 --> 01:42:06,820
But you have no integrity

1654
01:42:08,830 --> 01:42:10,490
You've won

1655
01:42:10,630 --> 01:42:12,160
Why don't you game?

1656
01:42:16,970 --> 01:42:18,230
Green Dragon

1657
01:42:19,640 --> 01:42:20,770
Game

1658
01:42:22,680 --> 01:42:24,110
The Thirteen Wonders

1659
01:42:24,850 --> 01:42:26,750
Do you think we had more fun playing mahjong
when we were kids

1660
01:42:26,850 --> 01:42:28,820
Or now?

1661
01:42:28,920 --> 01:42:30,410
Playing mahjong

1662
01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:33,420
To me, playing mahjong is
about having a good time

1663
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:34,920
Winning or losing is not important

1664
01:42:34,990 --> 01:42:37,820
I understand now, master

1665
01:42:37,960 --> 01:42:39,360
Understood

1666
01:42:43,970 --> 01:42:45,900
I'm hungry, let's go

1667
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,630
- I want a roasted drumstick - Sure

1668
01:42:50,440 --> 01:42:53,530
The winner of the 12th World
King of Mahjong Championship is

1669
01:42:53,610 --> 01:42:57,540
None other than our boss, Wong Tin Ba

1670
01:43:08,020 --> 01:43:09,890
Who else could it be, other than our boss?

1671
01:43:10,030 --> 01:43:12,390
Come say it with me

1672
01:43:12,460 --> 01:43:14,690
Wong Tin Ba! Wong Tin Ba!

1673
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:16,230
Cut the crap, let's go and have a feast

1674
01:43:16,330 --> 01:43:18,320
Yeah, let's go

1675
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:23,740
Hubby

1676
01:43:23,810 --> 01:43:25,330
What do you want now?

1677
01:43:25,410 --> 01:43:28,470
I feel very guilty, are you mad at me?

1678
01:43:28,780 --> 01:43:29,870
Let's not talk about this anymore

1679
01:43:29,980 --> 01:43:31,970
The most important thing is
for our family to stay together

1680
01:43:32,050 --> 01:43:35,380
That's right, you're the best

1681
01:43:35,450 --> 01:43:36,750
Pak Chong Fatt

1682
01:43:36,890 --> 01:43:37,870
What do you want?

1683
01:43:37,990 --> 01:43:39,540
I want to have a word with your father

1684
01:43:39,620 --> 01:43:42,250
If they don't sound right to you,
give me two slaps

1685
01:43:44,090 --> 01:43:44,920
What do you want?

1686
01:43:46,530 --> 01:43:49,090
I have been very worried that

1687
01:43:49,200 --> 01:43:50,390
I won't win again after my luck runs out

1688
01:43:50,670 --> 01:43:52,760
But I understand today that

1689
01:43:52,900 --> 01:43:54,990
As long as I have you as a brother

1690
01:43:55,100 --> 01:43:57,400
It's hard for me to lose

1691
01:44:00,310 --> 01:44:03,800
I'm not the only one you have around you

1692
01:44:04,750 --> 01:44:06,710
Alright, bye

1693
01:44:09,450 --> 01:44:11,420
Hey

1694
01:44:14,190 --> 01:44:16,620
Are you two going to leave just like that?

1695
01:44:19,230 --> 01:44:21,960
I know I was wrong to curse you with polio

1696
01:44:22,100 --> 01:44:23,620
But you're my daughter and I'm your dad

1697
01:44:23,730 --> 01:44:25,320
we're family

1698
01:44:25,570 --> 01:44:26,660
Let's make up, shall we

1699
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:30,960
I can even give up my
tit e of King of Mahjong

1700
01:44:32,110 --> 01:44:32,900
Sorry

1701
01:44:35,510 --> 01:44:38,070
I'm sorry

1702
01:44:43,120 --> 01:44:46,250
You can be so gentlemanly, Dad

1703
01:44:48,860 --> 01:44:51,020
How can you leave just like that

1704
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:53,290
Don't forget you've killed Little Mosquito

1705
01:44:53,400 --> 01:44:54,590
I would be left alone if you leave

1706
01:44:54,700 --> 01:44:56,820
Our house would become so
cold like a big fridge

1707
01:44:56,900 --> 01:44:58,160
You want me to freeze to death?

1708
01:44:59,030 --> 01:45:00,370
Stay and continue to help me

1709
01:45:01,270 --> 01:45:01,790
Okay?

1710
01:45:03,710 --> 01:45:04,760
Thank you boss

1711
01:45:18,490 --> 01:45:21,280
- Green Dragon, hurry up - Sassy

1712
01:45:21,390 --> 01:45:22,650
Nine Circles

1713
01:45:27,030 --> 01:45:29,330
- Be careful - Hurry up

1714
01:45:29,460 --> 01:45:31,060
- Two Circles - Pong

1715
01:45:31,200 --> 01:45:32,720
You're so stupid

1716
01:45:33,540 --> 01:45:34,730
There's no fool in mahjong

1717
01:45:34,840 --> 01:45:36,030
what matters most is to be happy, right?

1718
01:45:36,170 --> 01:45:37,830
- Don't scold him - One Circle

1719
01:45:38,240 --> 01:45:40,870
Why do the kitchens of these
rich people feel so hot?

1720
01:45:42,240 --> 01:45:45,470
Oh, that's because you are clinging onto me.
Food must be served on time during CNY

1721
01:45:45,580 --> 01:45:47,140
Didn't you say you like it
when I pretend to be a koala bear?

1722
01:45:47,250 --> 01:45:48,440
Brother

1723
01:45:48,550 --> 01:45:50,420
This is the kitchen, not the bedroom

1724
01:45:50,550 --> 01:45:52,350
I asked you to cook rice,
not fry rice (make love)

1725
01:45:52,420 --> 01:45:54,680
It's been 20 over years, I can't help myself

1726
01:45:55,390 --> 01:45:56,150
Speaking of which

1727
01:45:56,260 --> 01:45:57,590
The Legendary Kungfu that Master taught you

1728
01:45:57,690 --> 01:45:59,680
what was it for?

1729
01:46:00,530 --> 01:46:01,460
How did he know?

1730
01:46:01,560 --> 01:46:03,720
I think those vegetables have been overcooked

1731
01:46:03,870 --> 01:46:05,460
Boss

1732
01:46:05,530 --> 01:46:07,090
You've got mail

1733
01:46:07,970 --> 01:46:08,730
Brother

1734
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:12,160
- Seems like it's from master - Yes

1735
01:46:18,950 --> 01:46:21,680
Ah Fatt, Ah You, this is your master

1736
01:46:22,250 --> 01:46:24,120
Excuse me, please come back

1737
01:46:24,250 --> 01:46:25,910
Ah Fatt, Ah You, how have you two been

1738
01:46:26,050 --> 01:46:26,950
- Master - First of all, congratulations

1739
01:46:27,090 --> 01:46:28,750
I heard you're still the King of Mahjong

1740
01:46:28,890 --> 01:46:30,590
I'm so proud of you, and happy for you

1741
01:46:30,690 --> 01:46:33,560
But nothing beats knowing you two
are on good terms again

1742
01:46:33,660 --> 01:46:34,720
That is great news indeed

1743
01:46:34,860 --> 01:46:35,960
Master is doing really great over here

1744
01:46:36,100 --> 01:46:37,530
I have blondes as my disciples

1745
01:46:37,630 --> 01:46:40,400
Business is booming
and they all call me professor

1746
01:46:40,500 --> 01:46:42,370
Professor

1747
01:46:42,470 --> 01:46:44,600
America is a democratic country

1748
01:46:44,740 --> 01:46:46,070
They're all very open-minded

1749
01:46:46,170 --> 01:46:47,840
Your master practises the
Legendary Kungfu, right

1750
01:46:47,940 --> 01:46:49,200
Have you been practising the great condor?

1751
01:46:49,310 --> 01:46:50,940
I'm not going back anymore,
it's so much better here

1752
01:46:51,080 --> 01:46:52,710
Remember the "great condor", Ah Fatt

1753
01:46:52,780 --> 01:46:53,410
Ah "Fatt"?

1754
01:46:53,480 --> 01:46:55,140
Not this "Fatt", I meant that "Fatt"

1755
01:46:55,580 --> 01:46:56,980
Alright that's all, bye

1756
01:46:57,090 --> 01:46:59,320
Shut it down, bye

1757
01:46:59,420 --> 01:47:00,250
Your turn

1758
01:47:00,390 --> 01:47:02,290
- Let's snap some pictures - Stand here

1759
01:47:02,790 --> 01:47:04,260
This is for big brother

1760
01:47:04,360 --> 01:47:06,290
Come on, look this way

1761
01:47:17,110 --> 01:47:19,730
- Sorry, master - It's okay

1762
01:47:19,840 --> 01:47:22,280
Remember not to tell anyone
I'm practising the Legendary Kungfu

1763
01:47:22,340 --> 01:47:23,240
I won't

1764
01:47:23,340 --> 01:47:25,680
You're practising the Legendary Kungfu
for mahjong, right?

1765
01:47:25,810 --> 01:47:29,220
It is the Legendary Kungfu a right,
but not for mahjong

1766
01:47:29,320 --> 01:47:31,180
They're for the "condor"

1767
01:47:31,320 --> 01:47:33,080
Condor?

1768
01:47:33,190 --> 01:47:34,680
Mahjong players spend a lot of time seated

1769
01:47:34,790 --> 01:47:36,380
which is very bad for the prostate

1770
01:47:38,390 --> 01:47:39,790
I get it now

1771
01:47:44,170 --> 01:47:45,760
Come here

1772
01:47:47,140 --> 01:47:48,260
Brother

1773
01:47:48,370 --> 01:47:50,270
You said after listening
to master's recording

1774
01:47:50,370 --> 01:47:51,630
You regained your confidence to play mahjong

1775
01:47:51,710 --> 01:47:53,700
Did master leave any message for me?

1776
01:47:55,380 --> 01:47:56,740
Yes or no?

1777
01:48:08,720 --> 01:48:11,350
If I press this button,
everything will be history

1778
01:48:11,490 --> 01:48:13,620
How does that make me different from a dog?

1779
01:48:17,870 --> 01:48:19,800
Quit horsing around Ah Fatt

1780
01:48:19,900 --> 01:48:20,930
You think no one knows

1781
01:48:21,040 --> 01:48:22,700
You listened to someone else's message

1782
01:48:23,440 --> 01:48:24,500
Mind your own business

1783
01:48:24,640 --> 01:48:26,900
Ah You won't be coming back to find me

1784
01:48:28,210 --> 01:48:29,470
Scared, aren't you

1785
01:48:30,410 --> 01:48:31,810
Screw you

1786
01:48:31,910 --> 01:48:34,470
How is playing mahjong a gambling addiction

1787
01:48:34,550 --> 01:48:38,110
It's a good form of entertainment

1788
01:48:38,420 --> 01:48:39,650
That's right

1789
01:48:39,720 --> 01:48:40,810
These people betrayed

1790
01:48:40,890 --> 01:48:43,980
the original intent of mahjong

1791
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:47,760
They should be cursed for eternity

1792
01:48:47,900 --> 01:48:49,490
Punished for their atrocities

1793
01:48:49,600 --> 01:48:51,160
Give them 2 slaps everytime you see them

1794
01:48:51,270 --> 01:48:52,820
4 slaps when you see them the next time

1795
01:48:52,930 --> 01:48:54,530
6 slaps when you see them the third time

1796
01:48:54,600 --> 01:48:55,730
See…

1797
01:48:57,310 --> 01:48:58,700
Therefore

1798
01:48:58,940 --> 01:49:02,570
We have to pay mahjong
with the right attitude

1799
01:49:02,710 --> 01:49:04,440
Play it as a healthy form of entertainment

1800
01:49:04,580 --> 01:49:06,510
Play it to express your love
towards a cultural treasure

1801
01:49:06,610 --> 01:49:09,550
Gong Xi Fa Cai and Happy Lunar New Year

1802
01:49:09,680 --> 01:49:12,310
May you all be surrounded by happiness

1803
01:49:12,390 --> 01:49:14,050
May all your wishes come true

1804
01:49:14,120 --> 01:49:17,180
And you'll have everything
that your heart desires

1805
01:49:17,290 --> 01:49:19,350
Gong Xi Gong X

1806
01:49:19,460 --> 01:49:23,690
Happy Lunar New Year to everyone

1807
01:49:30,140 --> 01:49:34,630
Let's get rich!
