1
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,640
Wait for me

2
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,230
Relax, we're just playing mahjong

3
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,710
Ah Fatt

4
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,410
Give me a serving of Three Great Scholars

5
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,580
Got it, no problem

6
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,350
- I'm on it - Be quick about it

7
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,000
White Dragon, Red Dragon, Green Dragon

8
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,540
Isn't that the Three Great Scholars?

9
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,470
Sassy, get to work

10
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,480
Pretty sure she's not here

11
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,630
Nancy, I've got your West Wind tile

12
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,940
- Let me send you to your doom - Pong

13
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:20,600
Watch it, or you'll meet your doom

14
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,480
- Green Dragon - Pong

15
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,980
You want to win? Dream on

16
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,690
Pong

17
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:32,180
Crap

18
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,990
Pong

19
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,260
Pong again and again

20
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:37,560
Don't bite off more than you can chew

21
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,030
Ah Lian you haven't ordered,
what do you want to eat?

22
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:44,070
I'm hungry two fishballs would be nice

23
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,030
I'm dizzy from al the
Pong that is going around

24
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:49,570
I need a Panadol

25
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,730
- Just that one capsule - One capsule

26
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,740
White Dragon

27
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,410
I'll Pong

28
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,880
Don't mess it up, can't you see
she's on to a Four Large Blessings hand

29
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:00,420
Don't make me lose my grocery money as well

30
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,150
Will it kill you to just let me win once?

31
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,590
Sure, the weakest hand shall prevail

32
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:08,180
Show me what you've got, dare you

33
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,690
North Wind

34
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,490
You scared me

35
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,030
Tiger, you want a Panadol, right?

36
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,170
I have one

37
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,500
Don't take everything you're offered

38
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,740
Even if you picked it up
yourself, double check

39
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,450
Kong

40
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:38,190
Jinx..

41
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,290
Kong again

42
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,950
Jinx..

43
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,090
Kong…pay up please

44
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,650
Here you go again

45
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,930
Three draws and you couldn't even get t,
you'll lose for sure

46
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:51,560
It ain't over until it's over

47
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,730
Come on, Nancy

48
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:54,930
Move aside

49
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:58,740
Jinx..

50
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,170
Three Circles

51
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,180
Self-Draw win

52
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,050
Four Small Blessings and three Kongs

53
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,380
How much do you think is the total winnings?

54
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:09,280
I'm a newbie at mahjong,
but this seems like a big win

55
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,480
Haven't you heard of "the weakest hand
shall prevail?

56
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,460
You watch out, the ghosts
might follow you home

57
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,880
If I knew I'd lose

58
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,620
I'd have gone home to watch
my wives play mahjong

59
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,590
Come on, we're neighbours, don't say that

60
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,500
A little gambling never hurt anyone

61
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,800
We're just having fun

62
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,600
Come on, pay up

63
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,210
- There goes my money - You little rascal

64
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,470
I asked you to pack yong tau fool

65
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,610
and here you are playing games

66
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,620
Stand right there, don't run

67
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:42,210
I won't f you stop chasing

68
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:45,310
Talking back now, eh?

69
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,720
Self-Draw win

70
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,090
The candy is mine

71
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,660
You' even settle for a Chicken Hand?

72
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,290
It'll bring bigger wins

73
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,960
Didn't you say you only
play but don't gamble?

74
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,030
That's why on y won some candy

75
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,440
And I'm the one who bought the candy

76
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:07,380
What's the matter? You want some?

77
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:11,140
No, today you're going to learn
how to lose gracefully

78
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:17,320
Alright, lets learn about sharing first today

79
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,350
What's the matter? Don t you want some candy?

80
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,090
Mr Yang

81
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:31,730
Well well well , look who we have here

82
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,130
Wayne Yang

83
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,500
Haven't I told you

84
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,540
not to gamble here after school?

85
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,570
Which part of that did you not understand?

86
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,670
We weren't gambling

87
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,620
Yeah, don't twist the facts,
we were just sharing candies

88
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:48,650
Did you see us gambling with your own eyes?

89
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,720
Although no money was involved

90
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,190
But playing mahjong is gambling

91
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:55,490
And that's wrong

92
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,150
Playing mahjong doesn't necessarily
mean we're gambling

93
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:00,220
I was teaching them mathematics and history

94
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,270
No, you were clearly gambling

95
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,500
Don't deny it

96
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,370
Deny? Don't you know?

97
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:11,700
This isn't just mahjong,
it's the essence of our culture

98
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,400
Go!

99
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:17,610
Mahjong is a card game created in China

100
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,180
Well-known and well-loved in the whole world

101
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:24,090
There are many different
theories on its origins

102
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,060
Due to the fact that it's
been around for so long

103
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,790
Some say that in 500 B.C

104
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:30,090
When Confucius was travelling all over China

105
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,730
He created the game mahjong
to spread his teachings

106
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,770
Using the three tiles of Red Dragon,
Green Dragon, and White Dragon

107
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,130
to represent the Three Virtues

108
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,230
love sincerity and filial piety

109
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:44,210
Commonly known as loyalty,
filial piety and righteousness

110
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:45,870
That's all good

111
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,510
But why do the tiles need to be so big?

112
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,480
You…

113
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,720
Such a big tile…

114
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:56,310
Carving such a big tile.

115
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,150
Right

116
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,590
That's correct

117
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,750
Later on, duel to different requirements

118
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,230
mahjong kept evolving

119
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,760
And finally settled with the 108-tile version

120
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,740
Representing the 108 warriors
of the Water Margin Legend

121
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:15,900
With the addition of various flower tiles

122
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:19,100
The whole set has 144 tiles

123
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:21,810
This is a flower

124
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,580
It's the bird

125
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,180
Centipede

126
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:35,280
It's a live, and it wants to bite me

127
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,230
Every player has 13 tiles

128
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,460
To represent the 13 weeks n a single season

129
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:42,660
There are 52 weeks in the four seasons,
totalling 364 days

130
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,270
The winning tile

131
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,930
represents the final day of a year

132
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:50,660
To make it 365 days, one complete year

133
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:56,010
Master, is there an ace tile to every suit?

134
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,810
Of course Little Monkey

135
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,980
Mah… mahjong

136
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,620
Pay… pay up

137
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,590
Playing mahjong is commonly
referred to by the Chinese

138
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:15,500
As playing eight rounds or "dry swimming"

139
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,090
A square table is used for playing mahjong

140
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:20,630
Which represents North, South, East, West

141
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:24,300
As well as Spring, Summer, Autumn Winter

142
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,840
- Four Bamboos - I'll take it

143
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:29,640
One tile discarded and three players win

144
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,380
Mahjong has been passed down for generations

145
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:41,150
Becoming a form of
entertainment in people's lives

146
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:43,520
Even the aunties enjoy a game of mahjong

147
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,890
Mahjong became a form of entertainment
and also a sport

148
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,160
It can foster relationships

149
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,060
Prevent Alzheimer's

150
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,840
Hurry up…

151
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,810
Finally I'm here

152
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,820
Come on

153
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,590
Eleven

154
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,100
Two Bamboos

155
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,400
Four Bamboos

156
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:29,360
I'll take it

157
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,910
One tile discarded and three players win

158
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,910
- Where are you going? - Toilet

159
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,910
- No way - You're wriggling out of this?

160
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:40,380
We've waited for a year for you
to walk to this table

161
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:42,420
You might take another two years
to walk to the loo

162
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:43,680
Pay up before you go

163
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,720
Now it's becoming ever more convenient
to play mahjong

164
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:52,060
It's even available online

165
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:53,760
We can play mahjong anytime

166
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:55,730
anywhere

167
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,630
See they are so well versed n history

168
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,900
You call this history?

169
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,930
Don't be a bad example to the kids

170
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:07,640
Everyone learns their history
from the TV these days

171
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,610
Nobody takes it seriously

172
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,210
At east their history improved

173
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,910
Since picking up mahjong
they've scored full marks in history

174
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,910
What's the matter?
Not willing to admit defeat?

175
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,820
Let's have a bet then

176
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:22,580
Sure…bring it on

177
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,650
Alright, same rules

178
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:25,820
If I win

179
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:27,800
you can't stop them from
coming to pay with me

180
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:31,060
And, you have to stop bothering me for a week

181
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,630
- And what if I win… - Okay

182
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,810
Dinner, movies, whatever you want

183
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,780
Everyone has 9 tiles, from One Character
to Nine Character

184
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:44,010
The first to complete the
suit n order shall win

185
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,340
Let's go

186
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:18,180
I'm done

187
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:24,150
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 correct

188
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:28,680
3 7 9 8 4 1 5 6 2 wrong

189
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,160
Sassy sister won

190
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,230
Mr. Yang lost

191
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:36,830
Sir

192
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,130
What a pity

193
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,000
Don't worry sir, you'll get used to losing

194
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,840
It's not your first time

195
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:46,070
losing to Sister Sassy anyway

196
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:47,340
Come let's continue playing

197
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:52,080
Let's carry on, Sir has to
go back to teaching

198
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,730
What's the matter? Are you okay?

199
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,570
I'm fine It's just that,
you eat with such elegance

200
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,540
As your father, I feel contented

201
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:23,210
That's great

202
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,830
- What do you think if.. . - Aright

203
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,400
- Actually… - I get it

204
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,010
- She.. - I said cut it

205
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,410
You want me to be like her

206
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,380
Talk softer, be more gentle,
like a lady right?

207
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,350
What's so bad about me now?

208
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:08,820
You are perfect as you are

209
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,130
- But if you could… - Dad

210
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,560
There are no ifs and buts in this world

211
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:21,510
I just want you to have a boyfriend

212
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:24,000
In case, one day, I'm not here anymore

213
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,840
Not here? Where are you going?

214
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:28,300
Back to meet my maker

215
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:31,210
Why would you meet your
maker all of a sudden?

216
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,010
Not all of a sudden

217
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,990
History tells us, people die

218
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:39,490
No, anyone can die except you

219
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,960
You can't leave me alone

220
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,300
Okay, I won t die then

221
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,820
That's more like it

222
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:55,330
But even if I don't d e
you'll still need to date

223
00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:00,880
I think that Wayne Yang is not bad

224
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02,640
You got to be kidding, Dad

225
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,200
Him? Not bad?

226
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,150
He's old-fashioned and dumb

227
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,780
He stutters and he can't even play mahjong

228
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:10,550
Every time I play with him, he loses

229
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,180
What's so good about him?

230
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,690
All those can be helped

231
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,420
Old-fashioned means he's honest

232
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:17,790
A slow talker is better than a smooth tailker

233
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:20,420
As for playing mahjong, it's easy to learn

234
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:29,770
What are you doing?

235
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,400
Hey

236
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,580
Hey

237
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,080
Are you guys serious?

238
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:43,090
Yep, it's here

239
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:43,920
Who's making a din here?

240
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:46,650
We're looking for Pak Chong Fatt where is he?

241
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,590
What Pak Chong Fatt? Hong Chong Fatt?

242
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,830
There's only Chow Yun Fatt

243
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:30,460
- Bugger off - Wong Tin Ba

244
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,000
Who's that guy?

245
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:39,770
He's the World Mahjong Champion

246
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,510
for 10 consecutive years

247
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:45,280
The modern day King of Mahjong, Wong Tin Ba

248
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,310
He's got style

249
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,950
What's wrong with the plastic bags today?

250
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,990
Those dace a so aren't fresh enough

251
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,360
Sassy, where did you get those plastic bags?

252
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,860
Where did you get those dace?

253
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,800
Hey there handsome,
how many seats do you need?

254
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:11,100
It's been a while, Pak Chong Fatt

255
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,200
What?

256
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,340
Pak Chong Fatt

257
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:16,850
Born on the 9th of October 1970

258
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:19,280
Libra 'O' blood type

259
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:22,180
His pass on is to help those in need

260
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,780
Cut the crap

261
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:25,850
Tell me what's their relationship

262
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,520
He was taught by the same
master as Wong Tin Ba

263
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,120
Rumour has it that,
after they turned on each other

264
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,460
Pak Chong Fatt vanished
from the world of mahjong

265
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:43,230
Brother Fatt is Pak Chong Fatt?

266
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,740
Are you sure you got the right person?

267
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,180
What do you think?

268
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:51,510
I never thought you could find me here

269
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,640
How's it going, my little brother?
It's been so long

270
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,520
Is this for your birthday party
or your daughter's wedding?

271
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,150
It's to challange you to a duel

272
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,020
The next mahjong championship is coming up

273
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:00,720
I must have a duel with you this time

274
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,020
It's been a while since I've played,
you should cut down too

275
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,160
I'll ask you again,
are you up for a duel or not?

276
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:09,890
- No thanks - Come on

277
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:11,840
- Nah - Come on

278
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,230
- No thanks - Come on

279
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:13,970
Nope

280
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,730
For god's sake quit dilly-dallying

281
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:17,400
Happiness can't be forced

282
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,170
Sometimes you need to
take a gamble for your happiness

283
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,940
You have no choice, because I have chosen you

284
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,170
I must gamble with you this time

285
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:11,250
Roasted drumstick

286
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,870
Such a pity, to become a
mute at such a young age

287
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,170
Alright, let's have a drumstick

288
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,910
- Girl - I'm not your daughter

289
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,070
I'm not your daughter,
and you're not my father

290
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,810
How did you find out?

291
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:39,450
Are you for real? I was just joking

292
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,820
How could it turn out that way?

293
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:43,990
I thought you were mute,
turns out you're a retard

294
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,060
You are as short as I am

295
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:46,690
Could you possibly be the daughter
of our neighbour, Tall Wai?

296
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,560
No matter what, from now on

297
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:51,100
You eat yours, I eat mine,
we stay out of each other's way

298
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:53,100
Why? We're a family

299
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:54,400
Have you ever considered me family?

300
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:57,570
- You seem pissed - You bet I am

301
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,300
My father was the King of
Mahjong Pak Chong Fatt

302
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,870
And I only know it now You
see me as your family?

303
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,310
You've kept a lot of things from me as well

304
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,250
Like what, tell me

305
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,480
When you sat for your exam

306
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,280
you watched my romance
"action" videos instead of studying

307
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:10,220
and I didn't say anything

308
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:11,780
Alright, stop it

309
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:15,060
It's not that I don't want to tell you,
but you never asked

310
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,590
Why would I talk about these things
out of the blue

311
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,490
Okay, let me ask you now

312
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,700
Why sell yong tau foo when you can be
the King of Mahjong?

313
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,500
Let's grab a drumstick first before we start

314
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:26,590
Stop pretending or I'll chase you out

315
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,570
Once upon a time

316
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,080
Speak Mandarin, sit down

317
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:38,770
I thought for such an important event,
English would be more apt

318
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:41,010
English? Your English sounds like Tam

319
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:42,350
Don't try too hard

320
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:46,420
We'll have to start from 20 years ago

321
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,180
Hurry up

322
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,660
Twenty five years ago

323
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:53,720
Zhang Shun You, the Wong Tin
Ba of today, and I

324
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,390
Learnt mahjong together from our

325
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:58,590
Master Ru from a very young age

326
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,040
Five

327
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:11,910
Mine

328
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,370
Yours

329
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,050
Mine

330
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:16,680
Yours

331
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:17,920
Mine

332
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,620
Yours

333
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:20,950
Skip

334
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:22,590
Next

335
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:24,790
Reveal

336
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,830
The Thirteen Wonders

337
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,290
Your hand is

338
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,830
decided the moment the tiles are stacked

339
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:32,460
If you're not the dealer

340
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,130
Try to put your tiles over here

341
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,560
Look, they're all Bamboos

342
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,770
Told you…

343
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,540
Master always said, you win by not gambling

344
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:46,170
Winning or losing is just an illusion,
lose your money but never your life

345
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,510
Only the good-hearted wins

346
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:53,250
He also said,I often win because
I don't harp on winning or losing

347
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,790
Is it really that important,
winning or losing when playing mahjong?

348
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:58,920
You win this round,
you could well lose the next

349
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,120
What's the big deal

350
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:03,630
Green Dragon, Four Large Blessings

351
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:11,970
You need a single Eight Bamboo,
you have a full suit of Bamboos

352
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,570
You lack a tile of Green Dragon

353
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,310
How should I play this Green Dragon tile?

354
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:21,610
Ah Fatt, Ah You

355
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:23,980
I think it's time

356
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:27,610
So ear y? Didn't we just have our lunch?

357
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:29,160
All you think about is eating

358
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:31,720
I meant it's time you two have a duel

359
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,920
The winner will succeed
me as the King of Mahjong

360
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,100
What happens to the loser then?

361
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,870
He will become the junior fellow apprentice
of the King of Mahjong

362
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,640
Might as we be the sidekick

363
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:44,770
I didn't say anything

364
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:48,670
Alright, best of three rounds

365
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:50,100
Begin now

366
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,020
Five Circles

367
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,720
Game

368
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,690
- The Three Great Scholars - Wow, you're good

369
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,360
Wow, the Three Great Scholars

370
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:09,130
Thanks for the recognition

371
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,990
Alright. Self-Draw West Wind

372
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,370
Chicken Hand

373
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,700
Damn you

374
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:17,000
Why would you even win on a Chicken Hand

375
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,340
You like chicken that much

376
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:20,240
Do you even know how to play mahjong

377
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:41,520
Green Dragon

378
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,970
Game

379
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,590
The Thirteen Wonders

380
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,500
Master I've won two of the three rounds

381
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:52,570
I'm your successor, now teach me
the legendary mahjong kungfu

382
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:55,340
I'll announce who's the winner

383
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:56,610
Of course

384
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,050
The winner is

385
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:01,640
Ah Fatt

386
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,720
Why him?

387
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:07,050
That's the Thirteen Wonders right there

388
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:09,880
I didn't say the one who wins will succeed me

389
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,850
You're right

390
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,730
I knew it

391
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,270
No matter how I fare,
you'll always see me as the loser

392
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:20,200
- Ah You listen to me - Say no more

393
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:21,460
I've listened to you long enough

394
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:22,770
You talk all day long

395
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,360
I've had enough of it

396
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:27,300
From today onwards,
I'm not listening to you anymore

397
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:29,780
I'm not your discipel anymore

398
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,120
God brother

399
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:42,890
So that was how Wong Tin Ba left our master

400
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,260
And went on to challenge everyone everywhere

401
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:47,230
From India to Egypt

402
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,960
From Egypt to Japlan

403
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,030
From Japlan to the China

404
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:54,660
Challenging the Kings of
Mahjong of every region

405
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:56,870
Ninety Thousand (Nine Character)

406
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:58,640
Red Middle (Red Dragon)

407
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:01,170
Children

408
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,640
Two Circles

409
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,920
Big Four Happiness (Four
Large Blessings), game

410
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,600
Sensei

411
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:36,780
Get rid of the tiles that you don't need,
no point keeping them

412
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:37,780
Self-Draw

413
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:39,750
Why are you discarding your
self-drawn winning tile…

414
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:42,720
Mahjong?

415
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:46,450
Hold on

416
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:52,190
The Three Great Scholars

417
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,730
- After you - See you

418
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:30,660
Finally, Wong Tin Ba got what he wished for

419
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:32,360
He defeated all the best
mahjong players in the world

420
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,930
And even won the title of King of Mahjong
for 10 consecutive years

421
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:38,330
But one thing could never wrap my head around

422
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:40,310
You gave up the Green
Dragon tile for Wong Tin Ba

423
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,440
So by right he should've won

424
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,440
Why did your master
announce you as the window?

425
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:48,350
Later on, Master explained to me

426
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,650
I've lost

427
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,190
why did you say I won, master?

428
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:57,930
Do you think I'm a renovation contractor?

429
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:00,030
I can see

430
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,090
He won in the game of mahjong

431
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:05,260
But lost duel to his character

432
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,300
My successor must have a good character

433
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:09,800
Winning without character s meaningless

434
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,400
It's been days since I heard from you
where have you been?

435
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,740
Everywhere

436
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:45,430
Any place where I won't see a poker face

437
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:47,340
a black face and two stupid faces

438
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,110
I've been there

439
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:05,560
You two look very free

440
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,520
Why don't you go accomplany the boss

441
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,800
Spend some time with your dad

442
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:19,400
Don't keep avoiding him

443
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:22,340
I'll just be another black face

444
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:23,770
Doesn't make a difference

445
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,630
You find that funny?

446
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,160
Don't you?

447
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:43,260
Yes

448
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,630
It's really hilarious

449
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,360
Why did you hit me?

450
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:52,160
Hit me? You…

451
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,010
How dare you lay your finger
on the great Wong Tin Ba

452
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,400
Game, 108 Warriors of…

453
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:18,030
What are you doing?

454
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,090
There are mosquitos

455
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:21,360
I have such a big house

456
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,530
This mosquito is actually my brother

457
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:25,840
He talks to me, through h s buzzing

458
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:27,740
Now that you killed it
who's going to talk to me?

459
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:29,010
You don't talk to me

460
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,170
And I don't want to talk to these two

461
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,280
You three jump into the water

462
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,480
Where did Deedee Zhang go again?

463
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,630
Right?

464
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:48,360
There you are

465
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:50,870
Baby who's that?

466
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,400
Who are you?

467
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:54,840
He should know who I am

468
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:20,260
Pure Honour Hand, Four Large Blessings,
Full Blossoms

469
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:24,530
- That's 88 folds, everybody - What a big win

470
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,260
It's nothing

471
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:30,500
What are you doing?
Where did the extra tiles come from

472
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:31,970
Hey are you trying to cheat here?

473
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,440
Cheating?

474
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:34,740
Are you kidding me?

475
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:36,610
It's written here No cheating

476
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,410
Do you think I'm blind?
Do you think I'm stupid?

477
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,950
Stop mucking about,
do you know what you're talking about?

478
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:43,610
They say bringing mahjong tiles
around this year brings good luck

479
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:45,620
And you thought I'm cheating…

480
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,550
What took him so long

481
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:52,030
Do you know what time it is now?

482
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:53,790
Must've come from here

483
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,830
What's with the crowd?
Did Michele Yeoh turn up?

484
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:59,430
All the neighbours want
you to be their master

485
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,630
I'm number 15 in line

486
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:02,470
You people are crazy

487
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,800
When did I say I'm accepting disciples?

488
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:04,810
You're Pak Chong Fatt

489
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,540
The first ever King of Mahjong,
of course we'd like to learn from you

490
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:10,270
If you're here for the
Tofu, I'm more than happy

491
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:13,650
But if you're here to learn
mahjong, please leave

492
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,230
Master I've been having a bad hand in mahjong

493
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:26,230
Any tips?

494
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:28,700
That's your fate

495
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:31,060
Don't ask me how would I know?

496
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:32,500
Why are two of you

497
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:34,700
holding me down instead of standing in line?

498
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:36,900
I listen clearer

499
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:38,410
and learn more this way

500
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,870
My reason is simple, just want to touch you

501
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,670
Do it on me first

502
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:54,250
You're such a pain

503
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:56,360
Come on, teach me a few tricks

504
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,430
Which one of you is Pak Chong Fatt?

505
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:06,890
am, what's the matter?

506
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:11,240
- Who? - Sure y not me

507
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,710
It's him

508
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,610
You two idiots

509
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:17,740
It's me

510
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,210
Miss, may I know what you're doing here?

511
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:23,010
I suppose you don't remember
the King of Gai Hu?

512
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:25,780
The one whom I defeated

513
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:27,220
in the inaugural championship?

514
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:29,020
That's right, he s my father

515
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:30,250
So you're his daughter

516
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:31,790
Come and give Uncle Fatt a hug

517
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,530
Come on

518
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:38,720
That year

519
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,740
He made it to the final s against all odds

520
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:43,930
But you beat him hands down

521
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:45,980
Since then he became like that

522
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,410
Never to smile again

523
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:51,940
Alright, since you're here

524
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:54,450
I'll let you have vengeance

525
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:56,110
You two, go distract her

526
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:59,120
Actually, we…

527
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,050
Today

528
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:03,290
Let us have a due

529
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,160
- Hey, you - You're up

530
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:07,690
I already said I've forgotten
how to play mahjong

531
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,230
If you don't play, you'll get it from us

532
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,290
Come on, if not now then when

533
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:13,300
If you don't play,
we'll annoy the he out of you

534
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:15,340
- I'll pester you - Won't leave you alone

535
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,410
Come on, play with her

536
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,300
Alright then

537
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,640
Let's do this

538
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,750
- Four Circles - Pong

539
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:39,800
East Wind

540
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,100
One Circle

541
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:46,320
Pong One Circle, here's a Four Circles tile

542
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,540
Lucky you getting the final tile

543
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:51,870
South Wind

544
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,870
Want to make a Pure Hand of Circle,
watch me spoil it

545
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,480
Eight Circles

546
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:03,540
Pong

547
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,350
Nine Circles

548
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:08,990
Pong, here's a Seven Circles

549
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,120
Pong Seven Circles

550
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:14,190
9 Pieces Penalty, it's on you
if he were to win

551
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:22,130
I'm sorry Hidden Six Circles Kong

552
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:23,540
Self-Draw win on Replacement Tile

553
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:26,840
I must win to make my father smile again

554
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:31,540
Five Circles

555
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:34,440
Get a Self-Draw win, come on

556
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:39,150
Kong

557
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:43,590
Eight Circles

558
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:05,370
Two Character

559
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,900
I'll take that Two Character

560
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:10,340
I'll discard a One Character

561
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:13,050
Game

562
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:14,680
What?

563
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:17,560
You're waiting for a single tile
of One Character. Snatch her game

564
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:19,600
That's none of your business

565
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,360
Are you playing or am I playing?

566
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,660
They came so far for revenge, w nning on
a Ch cken Hand doesn't make sense

567
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:27,900
Chicken Hand, are you for real?

568
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:29,730
That's a bit too lame, don't you think?

569
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:31,040
It's called a Chicken Hand

570
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:33,370
of course it's lame

571
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:39,310
I've waited 20 years for this

572
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,410
I finally got my revenge

573
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:44,320
To be able to pay with a mahjong expert
like Pak Chong Fatt

574
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,720
Look, your father is smiling again

575
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:50,090
You shouldn't have waited
for so long for that

576
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,390
f you had understood this 20 years ago

577
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,900
You wouldn't have been upset for so long

578
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,660
Playing mahjong is just
a form of entertainment

579
00:35:57,770 --> 00:35:59,000
When it's done, get on with it

580
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,260
That's a load of bull

581
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,300
Remember how I've taught you?

582
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:04,340
What should be done after you've lost?

583
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:12,750
What do you want?

584
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,080
Good manners

585
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:24,550
Thank you

586
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:33,330
Don't even think of kissing me, I'll hit you

587
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:44,740
Ramona

588
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,080
It really is you

589
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:52,450
Sir, have you seen my husband?

590
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,650
What's the matter with you?
Don't you recognise me?

591
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:57,850
I'm your husband, Ah Fatt

592
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,890
It can't be

593
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,290
My husband is very handsome

594
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,630
He's tall and macho

595
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,800
And he's very good at mahjong

596
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:07,770
Look

597
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,300
Take a good look at yourself

598
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:30,830
Not the chest, the tattoo

599
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:32,090
It's the same, look

600
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:36,460
This type of tattoo is so common

601
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:42,330
My husband is so handsome, so macho

602
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:46,030
But you're short and stout,
and you look so shifty

603
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:47,240
And you stink

604
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,740
How could you be my husband?

605
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:49,340
There are so many people here

606
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:51,710
can you cut me some slack?

607
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:55,080
But you're not my husband

608
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,210
I really am your husband

609
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:57,550
You're not

610
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:00,320
- I am - You're not

611
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:02,660
You leave me with no choice

612
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,660
But to share this with everyone

613
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,930
Your body anatomy s very weird

614
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,290
If I touch you here, you'll scream

615
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,400
If I touch you here, you'll get excited

616
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:13,000
If I touch your head you'll be obedient

617
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,030
Am I right?

618
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:17,700
Shut up

619
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:19,240
How come you know so much about me?

620
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:20,740
Because I'm your husband

621
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:25,870
- Ah Fatt? - Yes

622
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,720
Come on

623
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:30,250
Where is this place?

624
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,580
This is not a common place,
it s Brother Fatt's house

625
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,420
- Isn't that my house? - Yes

626
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:39,700
Nan Yang

627
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,820
Didn't I come from a rich household?

628
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,190
Come have a seat

629
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:46,120
I'll get you a drink

630
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,900
Sassy, we have a guest

631
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,710
Look who's here

632
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,150
Who's so important?

633
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:01,480
Take a look yourself

634
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,310
Hey is this your wife?

635
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,810
His wife? She left a long time ago

636
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:09,950
Why is your wife so bad?

637
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:13,720
That's not all, she's materialistic, greedy

638
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,290
- Ridiculous, shameless… - Sassy

639
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:18,730
How can you insult your mother
when she's right in front of you?

640
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,130
At east turn around

641
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,860
She's really your mother

642
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:23,300
- My mother? - My daughter

643
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:24,600
That is correct

644
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:27,010
Your mother's daughter is you…
right, that makes her your mother!

645
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,340
Why did you bring her home?

646
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,470
Don't tell me we need to
seek your permission first

647
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:32,610
This is my home, not yours

648
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:35,280
Hey you said this s my home
isn't it Ah Fatt's home?

649
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:36,720
Your home has been broken

650
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,550
since you left us when I was 2 years old

651
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,450
Stop arguing

652
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:42,390
Yes

653
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:45,160
I know this is a bit too sudden for you

654
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,460
It's the same for me

655
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,660
Did you know, when I saw her alone today

656
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:51,790
Looking for her husband on the streets

657
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:53,430
Isn't she looking for me?

658
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,460
But she couldn't recognise me,
even though I'm so handsome

659
00:39:57,010 --> 00:39:58,340
The only thing she recognises is money anyway

660
00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:00,170
Don't be fooled by her

661
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:01,640
I'm not that stupid

662
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:03,300
I brought her to the doctor, the doctor said…

663
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,870
Apparently a year after she left us

664
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:06,540
She lost her memory after an accident

665
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:07,710
Lost her memory?

666
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:10,340
Is this some sort of lame soap opera plot

667
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:13,250
Soap operas are indeed lame

668
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,880
But she really is your mother

669
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:22,130
It' hasn't been easy for her,
being alone all these years

670
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:25,830
You'll understand these matters of the heart
when you grow up

671
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:34,740
You can see for yourself

672
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:37,340
Who in the right mind eats mahjong tiles?

673
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:43,040
What? I'm hungry

674
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,620
You're not supposed to eat mahjong tiles

675
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,880
I'll cook for you if you are hungry

676
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,320
Let's go outside

677
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:55,430
Loss of memory?

678
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:00,670
Mom

679
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:03,040
Let me teach you how to play mahjong today

680
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:05,600
Mahjong? Is it fun?

681
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,040
It's okay if you don't know

682
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:09,170
Within a few days and a few losses

683
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:10,340
You'll get the hang of it

684
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:12,580
Come on

685
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:13,980
I've got no money

686
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,880
If I lose, I only have
my daughter to offer you

687
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:17,580
Let us restart the game,
since she just sat down

688
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:19,090
- Sure - Let's go

689
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:25,950
Eight Circles

690
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:28,830
Nine Character

691
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:31,130
Can I win now?

692
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:32,830
You don't have enough folds

693
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:36,200
Just follow whatever the others are doing

694
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,370
Discard that Nine Character tile

695
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:44,970
Three Character

696
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:48,780
Can I win now?

697
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:52,480
How is it possible that you still can't win

698
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:54,950
Self-Draw, game

699
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,460
The Thirteen Wonders

700
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:58,360
You scared the daylight out of me

701
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:07,740
I can't see through this mess

702
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:13,200
Eight-and-a-half Pairs Pure Hand

703
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:14,500
Is that a big win?

704
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,010
I win

705
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:19,170
Pay up

706
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:41,990
Five Bamboos

707
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:50,540
Self-Draw

708
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:52,310
Nine Gates Hand

709
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:54,520
Pay up, please

710
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:56,380
Are you sure you are crazy?

711
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:57,710
It really doesn't seem like it

712
00:42:57,790 --> 00:42:58,810
Thank you

713
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:00,790
When are we going to play again?

714
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:03,290
Come earlier tomorrow,
and you can play with yourself

715
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,120
Who's going to play with you again

716
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:07,490
First time and we've already lost so much

717
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:10,050
Do you know how many people
I'll have to massage to learn this much

718
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:11,660
I lost my grocery money again

719
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,730
Girl, they are such sore losers

720
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:18,240
Ignore them, we're rich

721
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:28,840
What are you doing?

722
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:31,380
Sewing on some buttons

723
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:33,450
I saw the buttons on your father's clothes

724
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,180
they don't match

725
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:36,590
Every single one of them

726
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,760
If you really cared for him,
you wouldn't have left

727
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:47,190
I was wrong

728
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:52,730
thought could live a good life
having married the King of Mahjong

729
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:55,570
But he suddenly quit

730
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:58,710
I got angry, so I left in a fit of anger

731
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:04,680
I never thought it'd be so hard to turn back

732
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:08,150
I know you both are still mad at me

733
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:10,750
I've got nothing to say

734
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,590
If you really don't want to see me

735
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:17,830
I can leave any time

736
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:23,500
I'm really leaving

737
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,910
Take care of your father, I'm leaving

738
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,370
You come and go as you please

739
00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:35,470
you think this is a hotel?

740
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:39,010
I've taken care of your
husband all these years

741
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:40,650
It's your turn now

742
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:45,830
One more thing

743
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,600
Don't be fooled by his carefree out look

744
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:52,260
He's never forgotten you

745
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,300
Take good care of him

746
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,460
It's so hot

747
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,720
I want to be a responsible husband

748
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:57,070
What kungfu is he practising?

749
00:45:57,130 --> 00:45:59,470
Could it be the legendary mahjong kungfu?

750
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:10,870
Ah, so you've invited yourself

751
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:17,040
Drinking alcohol in broad day light

752
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:20,950
Sassy doesn't care about me anymore

753
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:22,520
What makes you say that?

754
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:24,690
She's been Ignoring me…

755
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,690
I think It's time to let her go

756
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,530
She only cares for her mom right now

757
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:31,930
What about my life? I'm hopeless

758
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,490
So that's what you think

759
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:35,590
You're too pessimistic

760
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:38,600
I know my daughter

761
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:40,440
Her anger is fleeting

762
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:44,280
It doesn't matter if she's angry with me

763
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:49,010
The point Is I don't have
a place in her heart

764
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:51,180
I'm not important to her

765
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:53,020
If that's the case

766
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:55,760
Then why would she have wagers with you?

767
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:58,190
Because she wants to defeat me

768
00:46:58,260 --> 00:46:59,890
She wants me to back off

769
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:01,930
That silly girl

770
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:05,890
Every time she plays mahjong with you
she looks at you in a different way

771
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,770
Doesn't that prove that she likes you?

772
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:12,070
Remember, to be a good man…

773
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:14,470
One must not be greedy

774
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:16,470
And one must not be impatient

775
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:19,240
Even you have the lousiest hand

776
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:20,480
Don't be afraid

777
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:24,320
Sometimes, to lose is to win

778
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:26,590
Get it?

779
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:32,460
To lose is to win

780
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:38,430
I get it

781
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:40,770
Thank you

782
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:42,740
I understand now

783
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:45,430
Thank you

784
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:48,270
Sassy, here I come

785
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:52,140
Most handsome guys in this world are dumb

786
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:57,210
Sister Sassy is having a
duel with Mr. Yang again

787
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:00,150
Ready,go

788
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:13,870
So fast? Let's reveal it and see

789
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:18,470
Sir, don't you know 1, 2, 3?

790
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:19,970
What are you doing?

791
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:21,130
Are you trying to be funny?

792
00:48:21,210 --> 00:48:22,800
Sorry

793
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,870
Give me one last chance

794
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:26,710
One last chance, let's do this again

795
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:35,720
Every time she plays mahjong with you
she looks at you in a different way

796
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:50,360
Wow Sister Sassy wins again

797
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:52,300
But Mr. Yang completed his hand first

798
00:48:52,370 --> 00:48:53,670
So what?

799
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:55,070
I'm pretty sure it's a mess again

800
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,440
Reveal

801
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:00,410
Wow Mr. Yang

802
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,150
You're good, you've won

803
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:07,750
Very good, you've defeated me.
Don't look for me anymore

804
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:09,350
Sassy

805
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:12,160
Sassy

806
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:14,160
What do you want?

807
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:16,860
You've said before

808
00:49:16,930 --> 00:49:19,400
If I want to date you,
I'll have to defeat you first

809
00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:21,100
So can I ask you out on a date now

810
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:23,730
Suits you

811
00:49:23,810 --> 00:49:26,430
But I'm telling you,
I have no feelings for you

812
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:29,840
Then why is It that whenever
I play mahjong with you

813
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:32,900
you always gaze at me so gently?

814
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:38,380
Rubbish

815
00:49:48,330 --> 00:49:49,300
Brother Fatt told me

816
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:53,460
As long as you're the apple of my eye
and vice versa

817
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:56,200
Winning or losing isn't important at all

818
00:50:00,110 --> 00:50:01,010
I…

819
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,240
Let's get together

820
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,930
Apparently when you fall for someone

821
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,870
You'll feel happy even when he defeats you

822
00:50:27,970 --> 00:50:31,740
That's life But hey, what's wrong with that

823
00:50:31,810 --> 00:50:35,570
From the moment you fell for him,
you've already lost

824
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:37,840
Brother Fatt

825
00:50:38,350 --> 00:50:40,750
You're such an expert in love

826
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:43,150
So why did you break up with mom in the past?

827
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:49,360
Because of love

828
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:51,330
We went separate ways

829
00:50:56,230 --> 00:50:58,790
Your mom and I grew up together

830
00:50:58,870 --> 00:51:00,960
She was the girl that everyone coveted

831
00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:01,830
Self-draw win, The Thirteen Wonders

832
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:03,200
Smart and pretty

833
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:04,700
Good at mahjong too

834
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:07,870
She was known as The
Queen of Thirteen Wonders

835
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:10,970
Look at her smile

836
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,440
Makes my heart skip a beat

837
00:51:23,230 --> 00:51:24,750
We got married later on

838
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:28,660
I won the World Mahjong
Championship that year

839
00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:31,700
And became the King of Mahjong

840
00:51:49,450 --> 00:51:52,050
- Are you sure? - Is that necessary?

841
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:53,850
I really can't take it anymore

842
00:51:54,490 --> 00:51:56,420
Ramona and I were soulmates

843
00:51:56,490 --> 00:52:00,090
Since our dating days,
we enjoyed playing mahjong together

844
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,290
Such a lovely couple

845
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,490
Hubby

846
00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:06,530
She was the only person who could

847
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,870
defeat me at the mahjong table

848
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:12,200
This Green Dragon tile is annoying me,
watch me discard it

849
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:16,910
Four Large Blessings, pay up

850
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:19,350
You knew she wanted the Green Dragon,
yet you discarded it

851
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:21,910
Men

852
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:23,650
Hubby, quick, pay up

853
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:25,010
What's going on

854
00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:25,640
- She's giving birth - What's going on

855
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:26,480
Give me that

856
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:30,220
Ramona gave birth soon after

857
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:32,760
That was the happiest time of our lives

858
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:34,590
Six Circles

859
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:36,320
Sassy

860
00:52:39,670 --> 00:52:40,640
Two Circles

861
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,760
But good times never last

862
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:46,070
Before the 2nd World Mahjong Championships

863
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:48,940
was very stressed

864
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:50,440
I was terrified of

865
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:53,780
losing my status as the world champion

866
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:57,680
At that moment

867
00:52:57,790 --> 00:52:58,910
I realised playing mahjong

868
00:52:58,990 --> 00:53:00,850
no longer means the same anymore

869
00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:05,050
I started having second thoughts

870
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:16,460
Hubby

871
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:19,230
I've cooked some ginseng chicken

872
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:22,840
To help you become the King of Mahjong
for the 2nd time

873
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:26,540
I'm a little reluctant to go

874
00:53:27,650 --> 00:53:29,740
Why?

875
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:31,720
I feel like…

876
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:33,290
Playing mahjong for the sake of competition

877
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:36,120
seems to be deviating
from its original intent

878
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:38,460
As long as you win every time

879
00:53:38,530 --> 00:53:40,590
What other purpose do you need?

880
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:43,160
That's not what master taught me

881
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:46,730
I'm warning you

882
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:48,430
because I saw a bright future in you

883
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,300
I'm investing my youth in you

884
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:52,310
I won't allow you to give up

885
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:54,800
Ramona don't go

886
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,350
What's going to happen to me and Sassy
if you leave?

887
00:53:57,410 --> 00:53:59,400
My husband the King of Mahjong,
is now a useless man

888
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:02,180
Why should I stay?

889
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:04,450
What will it take to make you stay?

890
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:06,220
Play a round with me

891
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:09,150
If you win, you can give
the competition a miss

892
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:10,420
If I win

893
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:12,650
you have to clinch the
World Mahjong Championship

894
00:54:12,730 --> 00:54:14,420
You can't force me like this

895
00:54:14,530 --> 00:54:16,260
You're the one forcing me to do this

896
00:54:16,370 --> 00:54:18,990
I could've become the Queen of Mahjong

897
00:54:19,070 --> 00:54:21,700
I gave up everything to marry you,
the King of Mahjong

898
00:54:21,770 --> 00:54:24,360
Now you're telling me to give up my dream

899
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,030
Let's play a round then

900
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:37,710
White Dragon

901
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:40,680
Kong

902
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:43,220
Four Character

903
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:47,660
Red Dragon

904
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:49,030
Kong

905
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:53,230
Eight Circles

906
00:54:57,740 --> 00:54:59,430
Green Dragon

907
00:54:59,510 --> 00:55:00,770
Kong

908
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:05,540
Seven Bamboos

909
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:10,340
I used to let her win all the time

910
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:12,410
But this time

911
00:55:34,510 --> 00:55:35,600
Ramona

912
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:38,000
Chicken Hand

913
00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:41,780
I'm not that important to you after all

914
00:55:48,490 --> 00:55:51,320
Little did she know that
I let her go on purpose

915
00:55:52,290 --> 00:55:55,390
Although I didn't want to complete anymore

916
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:59,920
But she was still so young.
She should pursue her dreams

917
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,990
I didn't want to hold her back

918
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:08,300
Your wife was heartless, didn't it hurt you?

919
00:56:09,310 --> 00:56:12,540
That's how youngsters are, they want glamour

920
00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:15,340
Who doesn't want to be the Queen of Mahjong

921
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:20,120
Do you still love your
wife then, Brother Fatt?

922
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,150
Of course

923
00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:26,460
Every second of my life

924
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,970
So handsome, let's put that on Facebook

925
00:56:41,310 --> 00:56:42,870
Boss

926
00:56:42,950 --> 00:56:45,850
Handsome should be one word, not two

927
00:56:47,650 --> 00:56:49,310
I did it on purpose

928
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:51,720
If not, you wouldn't have come in

929
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:55,350
Boss

930
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:57,690
People are slamming you on Facebook

931
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:58,420
What are they saying?

932
00:56:58,530 --> 00:57:01,000
They say handsome "should be one word"

933
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:02,860
Take that picture down immediately

934
00:57:02,930 --> 00:57:06,330
Then upload other stuff to distract them

935
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,000
Avoid bad publicity before
the World Mahjong Championships

936
00:57:09,070 --> 00:57:10,370
Okay

937
00:57:11,070 --> 00:57:12,840
How do I spell surprise?

938
00:57:12,910 --> 00:57:14,070
Just write it in Chinese

939
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:17,240
Good idea. Surprise

940
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:21,940
Boss, you're so wise what's the surprise?

941
00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:25,380
The first ever King of Mahjong versus
the winner for 10 consecutive years

942
00:57:25,450 --> 00:57:26,980
Surprising enough?

943
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:29,480
Oh Boss, so you're the
first ever King of Mahjong

944
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:32,030
Only now do I know that Pak Chong Fatt
had won't for 10 consecutive years

945
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:36,360
I've fed and clothed you two

946
00:57:36,430 --> 00:57:38,060
Yet you don't even know who's who

947
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:39,530
Look at those trophies behind

948
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,830
use them to store my sauces

949
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:42,700
can't you see

950
00:57:48,210 --> 00:57:50,080
What plans do you have?

951
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:55,250
Everything is going according to plan

952
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,100
I smell yong tau foo,
this should be the house

953
00:58:24,810 --> 00:58:26,010
I'll take it

954
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:27,980
The Thirteen Wonders

955
00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:13,450
Crazy

956
00:59:13,530 --> 00:59:15,690
Can't you walk properly?

957
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,730
Boss, you already came in this dressing
with a bell in hand

958
00:59:18,830 --> 00:59:21,270
Sure y I have to pretend to be possessed
to complement you?

959
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:22,670
Don't talk crap

960
00:59:22,870 --> 00:59:23,500
You've been here for so long

961
00:59:23,570 --> 00:59:24,730
why haven't you reported to me?

962
00:59:25,210 --> 00:59:26,700
Have you found out

963
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:28,540
what kungfu Pak Chong
Fatt has been practising?

964
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:31,910
Yes, I found out that he doesn't
even touch mahjong

965
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:37,550
That's great

966
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:40,090
I finally have reason to sell you to Ethiopia

967
00:59:40,190 --> 00:59:41,550
Just great

968
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:43,680
They suffer from famine and poverty

969
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:45,120
they won't be able to “use” me

970
00:59:45,190 --> 00:59:47,920
They can't use you, but they can eat you

971
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:50,160
Your skin is slightly wrinkled

972
00:59:50,230 --> 00:59:51,700
but your flesh is still quite tender

973
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:52,930
- Please, don't - Should worth a dime or two

974
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:55,600
I did find out a secret of his

975
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:56,900
What secret? Out with it

976
00:59:57,170 --> 00:59:58,660
He practises a kind of kungfu everyday?

977
00:59:58,870 --> 00:59:59,810
What kungfu?

978
01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:03,510
Pa ms joined with eyes focused

979
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:06,600
Tongue and limbs stretched out

980
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:13,790
- Rein in the temples and diaphragm

981
01:00:13,890 --> 01:00:16,410
Take in the energy of the universe
to nourish the brain

982
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:20,690
So, this is Master's Legendary Mahjong Kungfu

983
01:00:21,330 --> 01:00:22,800
Who's peeping?

984
01:00:32,210 --> 01:00:34,040
I get it now

985
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:39,180
If Pak Chong Fatt can master it, so can I

986
01:00:39,250 --> 01:00:42,810
Let's see who's the real King of Mahjong

987
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:46,110
Your mission now is to persuade him

988
01:00:46,190 --> 01:00:47,950
to join the championships

989
01:00:48,090 --> 01:00:52,220
Only then will your mission be complete

990
01:01:00,370 --> 01:01:04,630
Let's see how you resist my cajolement

991
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:07,730
Hubby

992
01:01:12,450 --> 01:01:14,240
Let's eat first

993
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:18,190
Hubby

994
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:22,680
I have something… to tell you

995
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:25,750
What do you want?

996
01:01:25,830 --> 01:01:27,120
I want to say…

997
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,100
We're back

998
01:01:30,470 --> 01:01:32,490
Dad, mom

999
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:38,160
Fill the bowl

1000
01:01:40,540 --> 01:01:41,870
Have they gotten married?

1001
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:43,140
Last I checked, they weren't married yet

1002
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:44,640
I really have something to tell you

1003
01:01:44,710 --> 01:01:46,270
Why not put that back to where it should be?

1004
01:01:46,350 --> 01:01:49,480
So much food today?
Is there some offering to the gods?

1005
01:01:49,550 --> 01:01:51,450
No, since your mum came back

1006
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,540
we haven't had a sumptuous meal

1007
01:01:53,690 --> 01:01:55,160
Thanks to you, mom

1008
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:56,520
Come let's dig in

1009
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:57,960
Let's dig in

1010
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:20,810
What did you want to say just now?

1011
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,980
Nothing

1012
01:02:23,050 --> 01:02:26,540
I feel like we're a family

1013
01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:29,490
What's wrong with you?
We really are a family okay

1014
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:32,160
By the way, when did you marry my daughter,
may I ask?

1015
01:02:32,230 --> 01:02:34,200
Last night

1016
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:35,960
You marry my daughter in my room?

1017
01:03:03,490 --> 01:03:05,080
So handsome

1018
01:03:09,430 --> 01:03:10,590
Hubby

1019
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:13,800
Am I interrupting your kungfu practice?

1020
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:20,230
Are you sure this is related to…mahjong?

1021
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:26,940
Here it comes

1022
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:28,640
I can feel it

1023
01:03:33,590 --> 01:03:37,220
Since you left, I…

1024
01:03:39,290 --> 01:03:42,630
- You haven't done "it" for 20 years? - Yes

1025
01:03:43,530 --> 01:03:45,760
I've practised the Legendary Mahjong Kungfu
for quite some time now

1026
01:03:45,830 --> 01:03:47,770
You guys are practising mahjong with me today

1027
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:50,830
I was afraid after not using it for so long,
it will…

1028
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:53,130
That's why I…

1029
01:04:05,020 --> 01:04:06,880
Are you waiting for the Six and
Nine Character tiles?

1030
01:04:10,090 --> 01:04:12,060
You need a single Three Character tile

1031
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:16,150
You want the Six and Nine
Circles tiles, right?

1032
01:04:19,030 --> 01:04:20,330
How do you know?

1033
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:23,300
You won't feel much in the beginning

1034
01:04:23,370 --> 01:04:26,310
But after 49 practice sessions

1035
01:04:26,370 --> 01:04:29,170
Your carnal desire

1036
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:32,340
will explode from within

1037
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,280
How does it feel like?

1038
01:04:36,350 --> 01:04:37,980
It feels like someone opened the zoo gates

1039
01:04:38,050 --> 01:04:39,780
and all the elephants charging out

1040
01:04:59,070 --> 01:05:00,100
Boss, don't…

1041
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,110
Boss, I'm warning you I'm very experienced

1042
01:05:04,610 --> 01:05:06,380
Once you start, I won't stop

1043
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:17,590
What are you doing?

1044
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:34,570
- Hey - You old and cheap woman

1045
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:36,870
Why don't you dig a hole and bury yourself

1046
01:05:36,950 --> 01:05:38,470
Don't let me see you again

1047
01:05:38,550 --> 01:05:40,070
Sorry, boss

1048
01:05:40,150 --> 01:05:41,710
I was about to call you

1049
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:45,010
The kungfu that Ah Fatt has been practising
isn't for mahjong

1050
01:05:45,090 --> 01:05:48,520
- It's for his little brother, right? - Yes

1051
01:05:48,860 --> 01:05:50,920
You might as well tell me after my "little
brother" is injured from overexertion?

1052
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:55,320
If you can't make Pak Chong Fatt
join the championships

1053
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:57,360
I'll sell you to Ethiopia

1054
01:05:57,430 --> 01:05:58,870
As for the gambling debts you owe me

1055
01:05:58,930 --> 01:06:02,800
I'll cut your fingers off one by one

1056
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:04,060
That's all

1057
01:06:07,740 --> 01:06:10,140
Wong Tin Ba I shall remind you again

1058
01:06:10,250 --> 01:06:12,080
Don't say I'm long-winded

1059
01:06:12,150 --> 01:06:14,710
Your 10-year good fortune is coming to an end

1060
01:06:14,780 --> 01:06:16,910
If you want good fortune for another 10 years

1061
01:06:16,990 --> 01:06:21,150
You must defeat Pak Chong Fatt
at the championships this year

1062
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:26,390
You're not just long-winded,
you're ridiculously long-winded

1063
01:06:26,460 --> 01:06:28,260
Can you turn on the heater now?

1064
01:06:37,940 --> 01:06:39,740
Don't tell me these vicious-looking people

1065
01:06:39,810 --> 01:06:41,800
are here for my yong tau foo so early?

1066
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:46,240
- Hubby - Dear

1067
01:06:49,850 --> 01:06:51,650
It wasn't easy finding mum back with us

1068
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:53,740
and now she's taken away from us again

1069
01:06:53,820 --> 01:06:56,260
This won't do, I must look for my mum

1070
01:06:56,690 --> 01:06:57,520
If it's a kidnap

1071
01:06:57,630 --> 01:06:59,180
why haven't we received any calls yet?

1072
01:07:06,570 --> 01:07:08,800
- Help - Ramona?

1073
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,770
You recognise your wife's voice, right?

1074
01:07:12,310 --> 01:07:13,800
- What do you want? - So cruel

1075
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:15,240
Very simple, If I see you

1076
01:07:15,310 --> 01:07:18,340
as one of the players in the
World Mahjong Championship

1077
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,210
you'll see her

1078
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:21,680
If I don't see you then

1079
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:23,440
you won't see her for the rest of your life

1080
01:07:23,650 --> 01:07:26,280
- Help - Ramona?

1081
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:32,030
- So? - Yeah, what now?

1082
01:07:34,930 --> 01:07:37,960
Brother Fatt is finally going back
to the mahjong table

1083
01:07:38,030 --> 01:07:39,860
Let's welcome back Brother Fatt

1084
01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:43,670
I'm very proud to be able to practise
and play with you

1085
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:46,000
I don't know why I'm very anxious suddenly

1086
01:07:46,070 --> 01:07:49,640
Why? Ah Fatt, we're here to practise with you

1087
01:07:51,110 --> 01:07:53,010
According to the module I've designed

1088
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:54,910
The first session should be…

1089
01:07:55,450 --> 01:07:56,640
Drawing tiles

1090
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:58,190
Everybody draw your own tiles please

1091
01:07:58,250 --> 01:08:00,380
Draw the Thirteen Wonders
in the shortest time possible

1092
01:08:00,490 --> 01:08:02,420
You can't look at the tiles while drawing

1093
01:08:25,450 --> 01:08:28,350
- Is this the correct way? - You're good

1094
01:08:28,420 --> 01:08:30,320
Next, let's practise how to tabulate points

1095
01:08:30,390 --> 01:08:32,880
Tell me the points the
moment I reveal my hand

1096
01:08:32,950 --> 01:08:35,580
These are the initial tiles of a dealer

1097
01:08:35,690 --> 01:08:37,720
That's Four Small Blessings, totals 13 points

1098
01:08:37,790 --> 01:08:39,760
No, it's a so a Mixed Pure Hand,
you've got to add 3 points

1099
01:08:39,830 --> 01:08:41,090
So the total should be 16 points

1100
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:42,600
- That's a lot of "fun" - No

1101
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:44,100
If it's a dealers initial hand
it's a Heavenly Hand

1102
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:46,860
A Heavenly, Mixed Pure Hand
with Four Small Blessings is 29 points

1103
01:08:46,930 --> 01:08:48,870
What about this one?

1104
01:08:56,980 --> 01:08:58,840
Four Large Blessings 13 points
Mixed Pure Hand 3 points

1105
01:08:58,910 --> 01:08:59,900
Triplets Hand 3 points

1106
01:08:59,980 --> 01:09:02,110
including the flowers is a total of 20 points

1107
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:05,250
Excellent

1108
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:07,950
How many points are there in this one?

1109
01:09:08,990 --> 01:09:11,620
Hold on, give us some time

1110
01:09:11,730 --> 01:09:15,820
This hand s neither here nor there

1111
01:09:15,930 --> 01:09:18,060
Obviously it's a Chicken Hand

1112
01:09:18,130 --> 01:09:19,570
Genius

1113
01:09:19,630 --> 01:09:21,600
- You're a gambling genius - My idol

1114
01:09:21,670 --> 01:09:24,430
Don't be so cliche,
we're learning from one another

1115
01:09:24,510 --> 01:09:27,170
I don't think you need to
practise the basics anymore

1116
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:29,070
Why don't we go straight into competition

1117
01:09:29,140 --> 01:09:30,470
Sure

1118
01:09:33,310 --> 01:09:34,800
I'm so nervous

1119
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,410
Hold it

1120
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:39,280
I've never been this nervous playing mahjong
in the past decades

1121
01:09:39,350 --> 01:09:42,350
I'm a little apprehensive about playing
against my master today

1122
01:09:56,370 --> 01:10:00,470
- Dad - Brother Fatt

1123
01:10:00,540 --> 01:10:01,570
What's the matter with you?

1124
01:10:07,180 --> 01:10:09,050
- Dad - How are you feeling?

1125
01:10:11,150 --> 01:10:12,710
- Lie down - Thanks

1126
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:16,020
It's no big deal

1127
01:10:16,090 --> 01:10:17,790
But I think I can t go to the competition

1128
01:10:17,860 --> 01:10:19,330
Why?

1129
01:10:19,390 --> 01:10:22,290
You were killing it in the beginning

1130
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:24,230
What happened?

1131
01:10:24,530 --> 01:10:25,830
I wanted to win

1132
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:27,130
This is what happens when
you're too eager to win

1133
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:28,860
That's why I

1134
01:10:28,940 --> 01:10:31,270
pulled out of the second world championships

1135
01:10:32,410 --> 01:10:34,310
I don't play to win

1136
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:38,240
With this mentality

1137
01:10:38,350 --> 01:10:39,970
how am I to defeat Wong Tin Ba?

1138
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:56,850
Let's begin the day

1139
01:11:03,770 --> 01:11:06,330
Where are you going so early?

1140
01:11:07,340 --> 01:11:08,710
Sassy

1141
01:11:21,620 --> 01:11:22,920
Ah Fatt

1142
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:25,350
Letter for you from Sassy

1143
01:11:31,070 --> 01:11:33,230
I'm eloping with Wayne Yang

1144
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:34,890
Don't worry, it's just for a few days

1145
01:11:34,970 --> 01:11:36,630
We'll be home once we've had enough fun

1146
01:11:36,740 --> 01:11:40,230
So this is Sassy's final move

1147
01:11:40,310 --> 01:11:44,540
Ah Fatt, you've raised a daughter
with such fine character

1148
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:30,150
Ah Fatt

1149
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:33,250
I knew you'd come back to find me

1150
01:12:33,330 --> 01:12:36,390
I know Ah You all too well

1151
01:12:36,460 --> 01:12:38,300
Since the day I announced your victory

1152
01:12:38,370 --> 01:12:40,490
I knew he'd never let it go so easily

1153
01:12:40,570 --> 01:12:43,770
But I'm traveling the word now

1154
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:47,240
You need to settle your own problems

1155
01:12:47,540 --> 01:12:50,310
A word of advice before I leave

1156
01:12:50,380 --> 01:12:52,710
You don't have much weaknesses

1157
01:12:52,810 --> 01:12:54,780
Except you think too much

1158
01:12:55,050 --> 01:12:56,680
If you weren't like that

1159
01:12:56,780 --> 01:12:59,410
Ramona probably wouldn't have left

1160
01:12:59,490 --> 01:13:02,820
Your life would've been complete

1161
01:13:02,890 --> 01:13:04,290
Do you remember?

1162
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:08,420
I told you, the true spirit
of playing mahjong

1163
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:12,960
The tiles don't determine winning or losing

1164
01:13:13,030 --> 01:13:14,870
The player does

1165
01:13:14,940 --> 01:13:17,460
The tiles are lifeless, but the player isn't

1166
01:13:17,540 --> 01:13:20,370
Playing mahjong is like learning
how to be a good person

1167
01:13:20,470 --> 01:13:25,000
If you get too caught up in winning or losing

1168
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:26,840
even if you have the best hand,
it'll a I be in vain

1169
01:13:26,910 --> 01:13:29,010
- One Cirle - Game

1170
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:31,480
The Three Great Scholars,
Triplets, Mixed Pure Hand

1171
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:38,260
Green Dragon

1172
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:39,850
- You're so smart - Game

1173
01:13:39,930 --> 01:13:42,860
You're not affected by the outcome anymore

1174
01:13:42,930 --> 01:13:45,420
How can you ever be defeated?

1175
01:13:47,540 --> 01:13:50,000
It's only after 20 years

1176
01:13:50,070 --> 01:13:52,230
that I began to understand this saying

1177
01:13:52,940 --> 01:13:54,670
Am I slow?

1178
01:13:55,580 --> 01:13:56,910
Luckily It's still in time

1179
01:14:29,380 --> 01:14:31,710
You really want to do this yourself?

1180
01:14:31,780 --> 01:14:35,880
I have my dad's genes,
sure y I won't come in last

1181
01:14:35,950 --> 01:14:37,420
And the most important thing is

1182
01:14:37,490 --> 01:14:38,540
I can take the opportunity to look for my mom

1183
01:14:38,620 --> 01:14:39,090
Ms Deedee Zhang

1184
01:14:39,150 --> 01:14:41,850
Welcome to the King of Mahjong Championships

1185
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:43,390
- It's her? - You know each other?

1186
01:14:43,890 --> 01:14:45,120
I've seen her before

1187
01:14:46,990 --> 01:14:50,020
We meet again, isn't that fate?

1188
01:14:50,930 --> 01:14:53,760
So that's your type

1189
01:14:53,830 --> 01:14:56,360
What type? What do you mean by that?

1190
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:58,130
Why would you know someone like that?

1191
01:14:59,670 --> 01:15:00,500
That night inbed

1192
01:15:00,610 --> 01:15:03,670
you said you would love me forever

1193
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:07,780
Since It's none of your business

1194
01:15:07,850 --> 01:15:08,910
are you still trying to be a hero?

1195
01:15:08,980 --> 01:15:11,610
I'll whoop your ass Miss Third Party

1196
01:15:11,690 --> 01:15:13,650
Miss, don't be too sad

1197
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:14,590
Sad?

1198
01:15:14,660 --> 01:15:16,920
I'm more than thrilled to see them fall apart

1199
01:15:17,090 --> 01:15:19,620
That's how she ruined a couple the other day

1200
01:15:19,690 --> 01:15:21,660
Just because she couldn't stand them

1201
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:30,630
I'm the type that he likes

1202
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:33,760
and he's been devoted to me all these years

1203
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:36,210
What? Are you jealous?

1204
01:15:36,310 --> 01:15:40,610
Why are you talking to
these people in public?

1205
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:42,150
Deedee Zhang

1206
01:15:43,020 --> 01:15:45,110
Who are you? And who are they?

1207
01:15:45,190 --> 01:15:46,650
Aren't you afraid of
diminishing your own status?

1208
01:15:56,530 --> 01:15:59,930
Why? Where did your arrogance go?

1209
01:16:00,170 --> 01:16:01,630
Initially there was just Wong Tin Ba

1210
01:16:01,700 --> 01:16:04,430
Now there's another Deedee Zhang
how are we going to win?

1211
01:16:04,510 --> 01:16:05,900
Are you nuts

1212
01:16:06,010 --> 01:16:07,100
Why are you putting

1213
01:16:07,170 --> 01:16:08,540
your own team down?

1214
01:16:08,710 --> 01:16:10,110
Dad, what are you doing?

1215
01:16:10,180 --> 01:16:11,870
I want to come and play mahjong here

1216
01:16:11,980 --> 01:16:13,970
Why are you dressed like that here?

1217
01:16:14,650 --> 01:16:17,580
I'm a man how can I
let my daughter battle this alone

1218
01:16:17,690 --> 01:16:19,550
Brother Fatt, you really are my idol

1219
01:16:19,650 --> 01:16:20,480
Of course

1220
01:16:20,750 --> 01:16:22,090
I thought you had no confidence?

1221
01:16:22,190 --> 01:16:23,180
Initially I didn't

1222
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:26,050
Now do, or how else do we save your mum?

1223
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:27,790
Dad

1224
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:29,720
It's good that you're conf dent

1225
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:33,970
But, the way you're dressed…

1226
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:35,930
- I think it looks good - No way

1227
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:39,070
The first ever King of
Mahjong must look the part

1228
01:16:40,470 --> 01:16:41,630
We still have time

1229
01:16:42,710 --> 01:16:44,300
- Let's go - Where to?

1230
01:16:45,780 --> 01:16:47,970
Not only do I want to win this competition

1231
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:50,950
I want the two of you to make the finals
no matter what it takes

1232
01:16:51,250 --> 01:16:54,020
I want Pak Chong Fatt to be disgraced
in the mahjong world

1233
01:16:54,090 --> 01:16:56,060
I want him to hit rock bottom

1234
01:16:57,420 --> 01:16:58,120
Yes

1235
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:02,850
Do you understand?

1236
01:17:04,730 --> 01:17:05,930
Yes

1237
01:17:07,130 --> 01:17:09,300
I've waited for this for 20 years

1238
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:11,330
I'll finally have my vengeance

1239
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:32,290
Hello everyone

1240
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:35,620
Welcome to the 12th King of Mahjong
World Championship

1241
01:17:35,730 --> 01:17:39,600
- I'm your emcee, Mushroom - I'm Sea Cucumber

1242
01:17:39,670 --> 01:17:42,160
Not only do we have the
best of the best players this year

1243
01:17:42,270 --> 01:17:45,260
we also have a huge
surprise for everyone today

1244
01:17:45,340 --> 01:17:47,070
We have invited an

1245
01:17:47,140 --> 01:17:50,600
incredibly unexpected special guest

1246
01:17:50,810 --> 01:17:54,140
The first ever King of Mahjong

1247
01:17:54,250 --> 01:17:56,770
Pak Chong Fatt

1248
01:18:02,690 --> 01:18:04,890
Mr Pak Chong Fatt,
you're the first ever King of Mahjong

1249
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:05,930
Is Wong Tin Ba the reason

1250
01:18:05,990 --> 01:18:07,220
you came out of retirement?

1251
01:18:07,290 --> 01:18:09,260
Is it because no one's been able to
defeat him in the past 10 years?

1252
01:18:09,330 --> 01:18:10,420
And you think you can?

1253
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:12,120
Are you confident of beating him?

1254
01:18:12,330 --> 01:18:14,200
To be honest, in terms of playing mahjong

1255
01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:17,500
Can you not throw it anymore?

1256
01:18:17,610 --> 01:18:18,900
It looks cool, master

1257
01:18:18,970 --> 01:18:20,940
I know, but it hurts

1258
01:18:21,010 --> 01:18:21,870
Thank you

1259
01:18:21,980 --> 01:18:25,000
Mahjong is a form of entertainment

1260
01:18:25,110 --> 01:18:28,280
If you pay to win, it loses its meaning

1261
01:18:31,050 --> 01:18:34,890
Ah Fatt, we're here to support you and Sassy

1262
01:18:34,990 --> 01:18:37,120
- Give it your best shot - You can do it

1263
01:18:37,190 --> 01:18:37,990
Thank you

1264
01:18:38,330 --> 01:18:39,380
Where's Ah Lian?

1265
01:18:39,490 --> 01:18:42,360
She's busy doing plastic surgery

1266
01:18:42,430 --> 01:18:44,860
Do you think I need plastic surgery as well?

1267
01:18:45,830 --> 01:18:47,200
Absolutely

1268
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,330
Let's play mahjong first

1269
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:52,970
Will the inaugural King
of Mahjong pit against

1270
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:54,560
the King of Mahjong of 10 consecutive years?

1271
01:18:54,740 --> 01:18:56,140
Today's competition is more exciting
than ever before

1272
01:18:56,210 --> 01:18:58,800
Relax, just relax

1273
01:18:59,010 --> 01:18:59,980
Okay

1274
01:19:00,050 --> 01:19:01,740
This is so hot, what should I do?

1275
01:19:02,150 --> 01:19:02,810
Just a little while more

1276
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:03,870
I can't take it anymore

1277
01:19:07,790 --> 01:19:10,880
Give it your best shot, Ah Fatt

1278
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:12,120
We're right behind you

1279
01:19:12,230 --> 01:19:13,720
Thanks

1280
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:20,630
I didn't want to wear this coat,
it was my daughter's idea

1281
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:22,830
- Understood - Good

1282
01:19:29,380 --> 01:19:32,140
And now, ladies and gentlemen

1283
01:19:32,210 --> 01:19:36,210
The champion for 10 years
in a row, Wong Tin Ba

1284
01:19:36,280 --> 01:19:38,340
And his daughter, Deedee Zhang

1285
01:19:38,420 --> 01:19:41,820
As well as his disciple, Icy

1286
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:44,420
Mr. Wong Tin Ba

1287
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:46,690
are you confident of reigning the throne?

1288
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:49,020
Are you conf dent of
defeating Pak Chong Fatt?

1289
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:51,590
Don't go, we still have questions for you

1290
01:19:54,270 --> 01:19:56,240
Do you think you look
good in that garbage bag?

1291
01:19:56,740 --> 01:19:57,830
Hello

1292
01:20:08,450 --> 01:20:10,780
That's him, don't take him seriously

1293
01:20:20,190 --> 01:20:21,390
As always

1294
01:20:21,460 --> 01:20:24,520
In the preliminary round,
the first contestants to score 20 points

1295
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:27,470
will have their bulbs lit up
each bulb represents 2 points

1296
01:20:27,570 --> 01:20:29,130
They will then proceed to the next round

1297
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:31,140
This process shall be repeated
until we reach the semi-finals

1298
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:33,870
If no one manages to get all their bulbs lit

1299
01:20:33,940 --> 01:20:35,600
The highest scorer will
proceed to the next round

1300
01:20:35,680 --> 01:20:38,870
Three winners from the semi-finals

1301
01:20:38,950 --> 01:20:41,610
Will get to challenge our
10-year champion for the title

1302
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:46,120
Let's kick off this year s
King of Mahjong World Championship

1303
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,260
Heavenly Hand

1304
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:03,860
Are you kidding me?

1305
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:07,810
First to qualify for the
semi-finals is Ms Icy

1306
01:21:12,050 --> 01:21:13,570
Game, Earthly Hand

1307
01:21:14,450 --> 01:21:16,940
Second contestant to advance to the
semi-finals, the daughter of Wong Tin Ba

1308
01:21:17,020 --> 01:21:17,780
Deedee Zhang

1309
01:21:17,850 --> 01:21:18,610
Congratulations

1310
01:21:18,690 --> 01:21:20,620
Will the father and daughter

1311
01:21:20,690 --> 01:21:21,810
be challenging each other for the title?

1312
01:21:21,890 --> 01:21:24,150
Let's keep our eyes peeled

1313
01:21:26,660 --> 01:21:31,430
Four Large Blessings, Concealed,
Mixed Pure Hand, All Terminal
Three Hidden Treasure

1314
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:36,440
Pak Chong Fatt's daughter
also made it into the semi-finals

1315
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:39,270
- Congratulations Ms Sassy Bai - Sassy won

1316
01:21:39,340 --> 01:21:41,330
Come have a seat, Sassy

1317
01:21:42,340 --> 01:21:43,900
You were great

1318
01:21:55,020 --> 01:21:56,220
It's already the final round

1319
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:57,880
Do you think Brother Fatt
will get full lights

1320
01:21:57,990 --> 01:21:59,390
That doesn't matter

1321
01:21:59,490 --> 01:22:01,360
What's important is to win

1322
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:12,130
North Wind

1323
01:22:18,710 --> 01:22:20,180
Pong

1324
01:22:20,250 --> 01:22:22,740
Discarding a character
tile to lure my North Wind

1325
01:22:22,850 --> 01:22:25,340
Trying to draw a snake out of its hole

1326
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:28,550
I can see through that

1327
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:32,510
North Wind

1328
01:22:34,930 --> 01:22:36,360
Win

1329
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:38,200
What a fine round

1330
01:22:38,270 --> 01:22:40,530
What a move by Pak Chong Fatt

1331
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:42,760
Making the semi-finals with the highest score

1332
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:44,240
He won by a hair's breadth

1333
01:22:44,300 --> 01:22:45,970
Ah Fatt, you were awesome

1334
01:22:46,070 --> 01:22:47,540
You's re so good

1335
01:22:48,810 --> 01:22:51,370
It wasn't a landslide win,
but you have such good skills

1336
01:22:51,450 --> 01:22:54,350
And what a character, I am deeply humbled

1337
01:22:54,410 --> 01:22:55,810
It's just a game

1338
01:22:56,920 --> 01:22:59,080
It's just a game

1339
01:22:59,750 --> 01:23:01,240
Pak Chong Fatt

1340
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:04,480
You purposely discarded a tile
for the player with the lowest score

1341
01:23:04,790 --> 01:23:06,090
Good

1342
01:23:07,490 --> 01:23:10,930
A hypocrite, but I like

1343
01:23:29,580 --> 01:23:31,110
After the preliminary qualifying matches

1344
01:23:31,180 --> 01:23:33,910
The semi-finals will commence now

1345
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:43,120
- East Wind - I'll take that

1346
01:23:46,170 --> 01:23:47,660
Chicken Hand

1347
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,330
- Five Bamboos - That's right

1348
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:54,000
Take the in-betweens

1349
01:23:54,910 --> 01:23:57,340
- Chicken Hand again

1350
01:23:59,380 --> 01:24:00,570
- East Wind - I'll take that

1351
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:03,650
East Wind two points

1352
01:24:04,350 --> 01:24:06,480
Can he win like that?

1353
01:24:06,550 --> 01:24:08,320
It's a race between the hare and the turtle

1354
01:24:08,390 --> 01:24:11,290
This move is called stuffing yourself up

1355
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:14,560
A few small wins make for a big win

1356
01:24:16,930 --> 01:24:18,160
- One Bamboo - I'll take that

1357
01:24:18,770 --> 01:24:19,860
Chicken Hand

1358
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:26,930
Mahjong, Self-Draw three points, sorry

1359
01:24:27,170 --> 01:24:28,940
As expected

1360
01:24:29,010 --> 01:24:30,370
See I was right

1361
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:32,670
- the turtle won - Mr Pak
Chong Fatt is the first

1362
01:24:32,750 --> 01:24:35,940
- to make it to the finals - Congratulations

1363
01:24:36,150 --> 01:24:40,640
Next, we shall witness
the battle of the century

1364
01:24:46,690 --> 01:24:47,820
You can do it

1365
01:25:05,980 --> 01:25:07,070
Look

1366
01:25:07,180 --> 01:25:10,670
She's got so many flower tiles

1367
01:25:10,750 --> 01:25:14,120
If she wins this round, it's a lot of points

1368
01:25:14,220 --> 01:25:15,690
If she makes it into the finals

1369
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:18,920
She will be working against
Brother Fatt for Wong Tin Ba

1370
01:25:21,290 --> 01:25:28,200
I'll Jinx that.. jinx…

1371
01:25:28,270 --> 01:25:31,140
Self-Draw win, Pure Honour Hand,
Three Great Scholars

1372
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:33,400
We jinxed the wrong one

1373
01:25:33,470 --> 01:25:34,670
How many points is that?

1374
01:25:34,740 --> 01:25:37,070
A lot, for sure

1375
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:39,440
Our second finalist s Ms Icy

1376
01:25:39,550 --> 01:25:40,740
Congratulations

1377
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:45,980
Who will be the final player

1378
01:25:46,090 --> 01:25:47,420
in the finals?

1379
01:25:48,690 --> 01:25:50,380
So nerve-wracking

1380
01:25:52,460 --> 01:25:55,190
But if you look at Sassy Bails and
Deedee Zhang's table

1381
01:25:55,260 --> 01:25:58,660
this is an inverse duel between their fathers

1382
01:26:01,970 --> 01:26:03,060
Brother Fatt

1383
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:05,070
Ah Fatt

1384
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:16,580
Go

1385
01:26:19,690 --> 01:26:21,310
Oh, what a klutz, Deedee Zhang

1386
01:26:21,420 --> 01:26:24,150
She accidentally revealed a tile
and is now disadvantaged

1387
01:26:24,220 --> 01:26:25,920
Luckily it's just a Formed Meld

1388
01:26:25,990 --> 01:26:27,430
Two Circles, Open Kong

1389
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:30,830
Robbing the Kong, win

1390
01:26:33,970 --> 01:26:35,730
That's a Trick Hand

1391
01:26:35,870 --> 01:26:37,300
You were waiting for the Two Circles,
Five Circles and Eight Circles tiles

1392
01:26:37,370 --> 01:26:39,400
You passed up that Eight Circles just now,
and you didn't draw

1393
01:26:39,470 --> 01:26:40,740
How can you take the Two Circles now?

1394
01:26:40,810 --> 01:26:42,800
Right, according to the rules

1395
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:44,780
she can't take this tile

1396
01:26:44,850 --> 01:26:47,940
But she's already revealed her hand,
so it's considered a Trick Hand

1397
01:26:48,010 --> 01:26:50,010
- Yes - We are at the last round

1398
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:52,350
and it's a tie between
Deedee Zhang and Sassy Ba

1399
01:26:52,450 --> 01:26:54,280
Deedee's Trick Hand causes her

1400
01:26:54,350 --> 01:26:56,720
loss to Sassy by a hair's breadth

1401
01:26:59,730 --> 01:27:01,090
Sassy

1402
01:27:01,160 --> 01:27:03,820
That's right, she won, that's my daughter

1403
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:16,510
Don't you remember what I've taught you?

1404
01:27:18,850 --> 01:27:20,340
Do you have polio?

1405
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:23,180
You can't even hold on
to an Eight Circles tile

1406
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:26,550
This is a mistake only an idiot will make

1407
01:27:27,490 --> 01:27:30,050
It's my mistake, but I didn't mean it

1408
01:27:30,820 --> 01:27:32,690
It's not whether you meant it or not

1409
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:35,020
It's about how I'm going to
face the public from now on

1410
01:27:35,100 --> 01:27:37,790
You're my daughter, Deedee Zhang

1411
01:27:37,860 --> 01:27:39,990
I don't want you to be
number one in anything else

1412
01:27:40,070 --> 01:27:42,830
I only want you to be number one in mahjong

1413
01:27:43,670 --> 01:27:46,370
Since I'm such an embarassment
to you, I'll leave

1414
01:27:46,710 --> 01:27:48,200
You're leaving…

1415
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:51,110
Who's gonna take photo
with me later when I win?

1416
01:27:51,980 --> 01:27:54,470
You'd ruin my perfect father image

1417
01:27:57,620 --> 01:27:59,210
If she really leaves

1418
01:27:59,290 --> 01:28:02,410
Cancel all her credit cards for me

1419
01:28:06,190 --> 01:28:09,090
The most exciting match
and the best of the best

1420
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:11,560
is unfolding right before us

1421
01:28:11,630 --> 01:28:16,500
The finals of this year's
King of Mahjong Championship starts now

1422
01:28:24,410 --> 01:28:25,810
What's the matter?

1423
01:28:25,910 --> 01:28:28,440
- Are you nervous? - A little

1424
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:31,040
Are you worried that you
won't draw a good hand?

1425
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:33,420
Sometimes I can't get good ingredients
from the market

1426
01:28:33,490 --> 01:28:34,950
but I still have to cook

1427
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:37,050
You can do it if you put your heart into it

1428
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:38,890
Chicken Hand is also considered a win

1429
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:41,430
Don't be afraid of losing just do it

1430
01:28:48,970 --> 01:28:49,990
Brother

1431
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:53,170
Don't call me that

1432
01:28:53,510 --> 01:28:56,940
From now on, you'll have to call me
the King of Mahjong for 11 consecutive years

1433
01:28:57,510 --> 01:29:00,500
Did you eat a lot of
garlic? Your mouth stinks

1434
01:29:00,610 --> 01:29:02,050
He does have a better chance

1435
01:29:02,120 --> 01:29:03,910
Cut the crap

1436
01:29:03,980 --> 01:29:06,750
- I'll finish you off in
one round - Of course

1437
01:29:21,470 --> 01:29:24,900
Let's see what you guys have in hand

1438
01:29:24,970 --> 01:29:26,170
Red Dragon

1439
01:29:26,240 --> 01:29:27,540
Pong

1440
01:29:34,850 --> 01:29:36,510
Let's move in for the kill then

1441
01:29:36,580 --> 01:29:37,880
Red Dragon

1442
01:29:44,290 --> 01:29:46,590
- Green Dragon - Pong

1443
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:57,960
I'll just follow your lead, Green Dragon

1444
01:29:58,040 --> 01:29:59,200
Why did you do that?

1445
01:29:59,310 --> 01:30:02,070
I told you before, learn how to
be a good person before learning mahjong

1446
01:30:02,180 --> 01:30:06,080
People might think you're talking about them

1447
01:30:06,180 --> 01:30:09,550
This is your elder show some respect

1448
01:30:09,650 --> 01:30:11,780
That's right, you need to respect your elders

1449
01:30:11,850 --> 01:30:13,610
Stop chiding your daughter

1450
01:30:13,690 --> 01:30:15,520
She's just following the bad example you set

1451
01:30:15,590 --> 01:30:18,350
It's genetics

1452
01:30:19,860 --> 01:30:22,050
You already have both Green and Red Dragons

1453
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:23,630
Are you going to get the White Dragon too

1454
01:30:23,730 --> 01:30:25,860
That would be such a coincidence

1455
01:30:25,930 --> 01:30:26,760
Pong

1456
01:30:27,700 --> 01:30:29,670
Why are you so careless?

1457
01:30:29,740 --> 01:30:31,900
That's a Three Great
Scholars you just gave away

1458
01:30:32,010 --> 01:30:32,990
And you asked me to show him respect?

1459
01:30:33,070 --> 01:30:35,200
How would I know he has all three dragons?

1460
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:37,400
And you know how much I hate those tiles

1461
01:30:39,610 --> 01:30:40,670
Nine Bamboos

1462
01:30:44,180 --> 01:30:45,340
Nine Bamboos

1463
01:30:47,050 --> 01:30:48,750
Nothing from you?

1464
01:30:48,860 --> 01:30:49,980
Watch me then

1465
01:30:52,260 --> 01:30:53,230
East Wind

1466
01:30:53,290 --> 01:30:54,350
Pong East Wind

1467
01:30:55,300 --> 01:30:57,890
I have to be smart about this

1468
01:30:57,960 --> 01:30:59,230
I have to let dad Pong

1469
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:01,460
- One Circle - Pong

1470
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:05,870
South Wind

1471
01:31:05,940 --> 01:31:07,200
Pong South Wind

1472
01:31:08,740 --> 01:31:10,770
- Two Circles - Pong

1473
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:13,780
West Wind

1474
01:31:13,880 --> 01:31:15,250
Pong West Wind

1475
01:31:16,750 --> 01:31:19,880
You'll have to cover all losses if you
were to gift her a Four Large Blessings

1476
01:31:19,950 --> 01:31:20,890
Three Circles

1477
01:31:20,950 --> 01:31:23,790
Even the blind could tell
you can't discard a North Wind tile now

1478
01:31:26,290 --> 01:31:28,160
Icy, prepare to Pong

1479
01:31:28,260 --> 01:31:29,890
How would you know?

1480
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:32,430
I'm the King of Mahjong

1481
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:34,060
I'll shout it out for you

1482
01:31:34,130 --> 01:31:35,760
Pong Two Character

1483
01:31:40,170 --> 01:31:42,300
She only needs another tile to win

1484
01:31:43,980 --> 01:31:45,810
I can't discard the North Wind

1485
01:31:47,780 --> 01:31:50,110
- Three Bamboos - I'll take that

1486
01:31:51,020 --> 01:31:53,350
How? It should be hers, not yours

1487
01:31:53,450 --> 01:31:55,010
Don't you know the rules?

1488
01:31:55,120 --> 01:31:58,090
Take it, even though it's nothing much

1489
01:31:58,460 --> 01:31:59,930
Four Small Blessings

1490
01:32:01,530 --> 01:32:02,260
Sassy

1491
01:32:02,330 --> 01:32:03,520
Winning (eat) with a Four
Small Blessings hand

1492
01:32:03,630 --> 01:32:06,570
She's devouring herself

1493
01:32:07,870 --> 01:32:09,100
Are you playing or is she playing?

1494
01:32:09,170 --> 01:32:11,640
If you're playing for real ,
she should be on her own

1495
01:32:11,700 --> 01:32:14,100
If you were to team up and bully her

1496
01:32:14,170 --> 01:32:15,610
Why don't you two share a hand

1497
01:32:16,810 --> 01:32:19,470
Boss can't defeat them with a single bow

1498
01:32:19,550 --> 01:32:22,110
That's a first in 10 years

1499
01:32:22,180 --> 01:32:25,210
Pak Chong Fatt is really something

1500
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:26,750
What the…

1501
01:32:28,620 --> 01:32:29,780
I'm letting you win this round

1502
01:32:29,860 --> 01:32:32,450
since you're not so bright

1503
01:32:32,890 --> 01:32:34,990
Let's break for 15 minutes and resume later

1504
01:32:35,060 --> 01:32:37,460
Don't take heart, thats how he is

1505
01:32:40,370 --> 01:32:42,700
There will be a 15-minute
interval see you later

1506
01:32:42,770 --> 01:32:44,170
See you later

1507
01:32:47,170 --> 01:32:49,040
I realised that you're rather fidgety today

1508
01:32:49,110 --> 01:32:51,740
You'll raise your chest when you
hold big tiles, that's not good

1509
01:32:51,850 --> 01:32:53,710
Be more mindful of it

1510
01:32:53,810 --> 01:32:55,140
Daughter of Wong Tin Ba

1511
01:32:55,220 --> 01:32:57,580
Come with me, I have something to show you

1512
01:32:59,720 --> 01:33:01,120
Your father said

1513
01:33:01,990 --> 01:33:03,920
What kind of wife did Ah You marry

1514
01:33:04,020 --> 01:33:06,220
for him to have a such a tanned
and skinny daughter

1515
01:33:07,130 --> 01:33:08,790
Pak Chong Fatt is here for the championship

1516
01:33:08,860 --> 01:33:10,560
I have completed my
mission, where's my money?

1517
01:33:12,470 --> 01:33:14,330
I want it now

1518
01:33:16,240 --> 01:33:17,930
So little?

1519
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:19,530
I've settled your gambling debts

1520
01:33:19,610 --> 01:33:22,230
Food and accommodation at
my house cost money, too

1521
01:33:22,710 --> 01:33:24,340
- What a cheapskate - Beat it

1522
01:33:26,750 --> 01:33:28,870
You couldn't discard the North Wind tile,
that's right

1523
01:33:28,950 --> 01:33:31,880
You couldn't discard any Bamboo
tiles as well, yet you did

1524
01:33:34,850 --> 01:33:36,880
So everything was a lie

1525
01:33:38,290 --> 01:33:40,280
It's not too late to realise that

1526
01:33:41,560 --> 01:33:42,990
You came back to find us

1527
01:33:43,060 --> 01:33:44,360
because he paid you to do it

1528
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,020
That's right

1529
01:33:46,100 --> 01:33:48,120
I've succeeded in getting him back
into competition

1530
01:33:48,230 --> 01:33:49,390
after all these years

1531
01:33:49,470 --> 01:33:50,940
Of course I'm happy

1532
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:52,560
Are you?

1533
01:33:52,640 --> 01:33:55,300
Of course who wouldn't
be with all this money?

1534
01:34:04,050 --> 01:34:06,880
What's the matter? Are you questioning me?

1535
01:34:06,950 --> 01:34:08,320
Dad

1536
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:12,890
Mom's leaving, won't you make her stay?

1537
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:15,620
Can I?

1538
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:19,400
Remember to take care of yourself

1539
01:34:19,470 --> 01:34:22,660
Don't open your eyes so big when you're lying

1540
01:34:22,770 --> 01:34:24,600
Don't act cool when you're cheating

1541
01:34:24,670 --> 01:34:26,100
that will give you away

1542
01:34:29,140 --> 01:34:30,800
Aren't you mad at me?

1543
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:33,470
Really?

1544
01:34:33,550 --> 01:34:35,780
I just want you to be happy

1545
01:34:35,850 --> 01:34:38,610
You knew she was lying all along?

1546
01:34:41,850 --> 01:34:44,450
Why didn't you say so?

1547
01:34:47,660 --> 01:34:50,060
Because you would leave again if I did

1548
01:34:56,140 --> 01:34:57,570
Wait

1549
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:11,480
Alright that's enough

1550
01:35:11,550 --> 01:35:13,280
Look, Brother Fatt is not only God of Mahjong

1551
01:35:13,350 --> 01:35:14,950
he's also Casablanca

1552
01:35:15,020 --> 01:35:15,780
We're not young anymore

1553
01:35:15,860 --> 01:35:18,050
We're here for the competition, cut the drama
will you?

1554
01:35:18,190 --> 01:35:20,660
Mind your own business

1555
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:23,850
Come on, we're not young anymore

1556
01:35:25,130 --> 01:35:26,530
My beloved daughter

1557
01:35:27,670 --> 01:35:30,300
Mom has wronged you

1558
01:35:30,370 --> 01:35:32,860
The first time I lay my eyes on you

1559
01:35:36,410 --> 01:35:38,970
I knew you were the best thing

1560
01:35:39,050 --> 01:35:40,480
to have ever happened to me

1561
01:35:41,450 --> 01:35:43,540
Can you forgive me?

1562
01:35:50,860 --> 01:35:53,720
- Can we proceed with
the game now? - Let's go

1563
01:35:56,360 --> 01:35:59,660
People think they need to be number one

1564
01:35:59,770 --> 01:36:03,100
What they really need is to be loved

1565
01:36:06,210 --> 01:36:08,200
Why isn't my father like that?

1566
01:36:13,750 --> 01:36:16,310
Sorry, excuse me

1567
01:36:16,850 --> 01:36:18,750
- We're here - Ah Fatt

1568
01:36:18,820 --> 01:36:19,410
isn't that a good thing?

1569
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:19,780
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

1570
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:21,010
Dad, mom, people are watching

1571
01:36:21,090 --> 01:36:22,780
I can't bear to be apart from you

1572
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:25,390
Dad, mom, let's play mahjong

1573
01:36:25,530 --> 01:36:26,890
- Yes - We have to be apart again

1574
01:36:26,990 --> 01:36:28,050
I'll make this quick

1575
01:36:28,130 --> 01:36:29,220
You'd better,I can't bear for us to be apart

1576
01:36:29,330 --> 01:36:31,590
Be good

1577
01:36:34,030 --> 01:36:35,360
Take care of him

1578
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:38,070
So handsome

1579
01:36:39,270 --> 01:36:42,570
Pak Chong Fatt, are you a man?

1580
01:36:42,680 --> 01:36:44,610
You're okay with your wife
treating you this way?

1581
01:36:44,740 --> 01:36:48,040
What do you know about love

1582
01:36:48,820 --> 01:36:50,870
Is there something wrong with your father?

1583
01:36:50,950 --> 01:36:52,780
Let's play

1584
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:55,110
And look at your wife

1585
01:36:55,250 --> 01:36:57,550
She just took my money

1586
01:36:57,660 --> 01:37:00,060
And now she's on your side cheering you on

1587
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:01,650
So unprofessional

1588
01:37:01,790 --> 01:37:03,790
No wonder you're married to each other

1589
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:08,900
Shuffle the tiles

1590
01:37:14,710 --> 01:37:15,800

1591
01:37:16,180 --> 01:37:17,400

Three Bamboos

1594
01:37:26,450 --> 01:37:27,780
I'll take that

1595
01:37:30,620 --> 01:37:31,320
Eight Circles

1596
01:37:31,460 --> 01:37:32,920
- In-between - I'll take that

1597
01:37:33,030 --> 01:37:36,690
Flowerless, Concealed, Sequence Hand
win with a single Eight Circles, three points

1598
01:37:39,170 --> 01:37:40,290
This is mere luck

1599
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:42,770
You won't be lucky everyday

1600
01:37:43,070 --> 01:37:44,230
Whatever

1601
01:37:56,150 --> 01:37:57,780
- Nine Character - Pong

1602
01:37:59,190 --> 01:38:00,680

1603
01:38:02,360 --> 01:38:04,480
- Two Circles - I'll take that

1604
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:11,960
- Three Bamboos - Pong

1605
01:38:17,970 --> 01:38:19,960
- One Bamboo - Something to take again

1606
01:38:25,080 --> 01:38:26,540
Are you nuts?

1607
01:38:27,950 --> 01:38:30,140
All these years you've
been the King of Mahjong

1608
01:38:30,250 --> 01:38:33,310
Your daughter has been unhappy

1609
01:38:33,420 --> 01:38:34,750
Are you happy?

1610
01:38:35,860 --> 01:38:39,520
One has polio, one s pea-brained

1611
01:38:39,630 --> 01:38:41,090
Just play

1612
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:48,170
- Eight Character - Pong

1613
01:38:50,770 --> 01:38:52,170
win

1614
01:38:57,410 --> 01:38:59,340
I am destined to win today

1615
01:38:59,450 --> 01:39:01,970
No matter whose side you're on

1616
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:15,520
Do you still remember when we were young

1617
01:39:15,630 --> 01:39:18,860
Master told us a story
about the wind and the sun?

1618
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:21,560
He's been such a dumbass since young

1619
01:39:21,670 --> 01:39:22,760
Six Bamboos

1620
01:39:33,610 --> 01:39:34,640

Three Character

1623
01:39:41,820 --> 01:39:44,950
Dad, he has all the suits

1624
01:39:45,090 --> 01:39:47,220
I'm sure he's building The Thirteen Wonders

1625
01:39:47,330 --> 01:39:50,760
It won't be that easy

1626
01:39:55,670 --> 01:39:58,400
Why would Wong Tin Ba
build The Thirteen Wonders

1627
01:39:58,500 --> 01:40:01,440
The focus should be on the Green Dragon now

1628
01:40:03,040 --> 01:40:04,030
Seven Bamboos

1629
01:40:08,580 --> 01:40:09,780
Two Character

1630
01:40:13,590 --> 01:40:17,150
Everything is going so well

1631
01:41:17,620 --> 01:41:19,550
Pong

1632
01:41:20,050 --> 01:41:22,250
Don't rush it

1633
01:41:22,360 --> 01:41:25,380
Everyone can tell I'm waiting
for the Green Dragon tile

1634
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:28,490
Yet you discarded it?
Are you out of your mind?

1635
01:41:28,590 --> 01:41:31,060
Because all you care
about s winning or losing

1636
01:41:38,870 --> 01:41:39,900
Green Dragon

1637
01:41:40,040 --> 01:41:41,840
I should thank you

1638
01:41:41,940 --> 01:41:45,170
Because of your ploy, I found my wife

1639
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:47,750
And my daughter reunited with her mum

1640
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:49,580
Brother

1641
01:41:49,720 --> 01:41:53,520
This Green Dragon is just a mahjong tile

1642
01:41:53,620 --> 01:41:55,610
I'll give it to you if you like

1643
01:41:57,760 --> 01:42:00,920
So we are really poles apart

1644
01:42:02,330 --> 01:42:06,030
It feels as though Pak Chong Fatt
is not a mere human being

1645
01:42:06,600 --> 01:42:07,900
He's like.

1646
01:42:08,030 --> 01:42:10,430
He is…

1647
01:42:10,570 --> 01:42:12,870
Right, that's him

1648
01:42:13,170 --> 01:42:16,540
Wukong, you want the Green Dragon tile?

1649
01:42:17,110 --> 01:42:19,240
I have it

1650
01:42:19,410 --> 01:42:22,610
It always gets in my way,
shall I give it to you?

1651
01:42:29,790 --> 01:42:30,780
Wukong

1652
01:42:30,920 --> 01:42:32,410
You're good at playing mahjong

1653
01:42:32,530 --> 01:42:36,120
But you have no integrity

1654
01:42:38,130 --> 01:42:39,790
You've won

1655
01:42:39,930 --> 01:42:41,460
Why don't you game?

1656
01:42:46,270 --> 01:42:47,530
Green Dragon

1657
01:42:48,940 --> 01:42:50,070
Game

1658
01:42:51,980 --> 01:42:53,410
The Thirteen Wonders

1659
01:42:54,150 --> 01:42:56,050
Do you think we had more fun playing mahjong
when we were kids

1660
01:42:56,150 --> 01:42:58,120
Or now?

1661
01:42:58,220 --> 01:42:59,710
Playing mahjong

1662
01:42:59,820 --> 01:43:02,720
To me, playing mahjong is
about having a good time

1663
01:43:02,820 --> 01:43:04,220
Winning or losing is not important

1664
01:43:04,290 --> 01:43:07,120
I understand now, master

1665
01:43:07,260 --> 01:43:08,660
Understood

1666
01:43:13,270 --> 01:43:15,200
I'm hungry, let's go

1667
01:43:15,300 --> 01:43:17,930
- I want a roasted drumstick - Sure

1668
01:43:19,740 --> 01:43:22,830
The winner of the 12th World
King of Mahjong Championship is

1669
01:43:22,910 --> 01:43:26,840
None other than our boss, Wong Tin Ba

1670
01:43:37,320 --> 01:43:39,190
Who else could it be, other than our boss?

1671
01:43:39,330 --> 01:43:41,690
Come say it with me

1672
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:43,990
Wong Tin Ba! Wong Tin Ba!

1673
01:43:44,100 --> 01:43:45,530
Cut the crap, let's go and have a feast

1674
01:43:45,630 --> 01:43:47,620
Yeah, let's go

1675
01:43:51,700 --> 01:43:53,040
Hubby

1676
01:43:53,110 --> 01:43:54,630
What do you want now?

1677
01:43:54,710 --> 01:43:57,770
I feel very guilty, are you mad at me?

1678
01:43:58,080 --> 01:43:59,170
Let's not talk about this anymore

1679
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:01,270
The most important thing is
for our family to stay together

1680
01:44:01,350 --> 01:44:04,680
That's right, you're the best

1681
01:44:04,750 --> 01:44:06,050
Pak Chong Fatt

1682
01:44:06,190 --> 01:44:07,170
What do you want?

1683
01:44:07,290 --> 01:44:08,840
I want to have a word with your father

1684
01:44:08,920 --> 01:44:11,550
If they don't sound right to you,
give me two slaps

1685
01:44:13,390 --> 01:44:14,220
What do you want?

1686
01:44:15,830 --> 01:44:18,390
I have been very worried that

1687
01:44:18,500 --> 01:44:19,690
I won't win again after my luck runs out

1688
01:44:19,970 --> 01:44:22,060
But I understand today that

1689
01:44:22,200 --> 01:44:24,290
As long as I have you as a brother

1690
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:26,700
It's hard for me to lose

1691
01:44:29,610 --> 01:44:33,100
I'm not the only one you have around you

1692
01:44:34,050 --> 01:44:36,010
Alright, bye

1693
01:44:38,750 --> 01:44:40,720
Hey

1694
01:44:43,490 --> 01:44:45,920
Are you two going to leave just like that?

1695
01:44:48,530 --> 01:44:51,260
I know I was wrong to curse you with polio

1696
01:44:51,400 --> 01:44:52,920
But you're my daughter and I'm your dad

1697
01:44:53,030 --> 01:44:54,620
we're family

1698
01:44:54,870 --> 01:44:55,960
Let's make up, shall we

1699
01:44:58,740 --> 01:45:00,260
I can even give up my
tit e of King of Mahjong

1700
01:45:01,410 --> 01:45:02,200
Sorry

1701
01:45:04,810 --> 01:45:07,370
I'm sorry

1702
01:45:12,420 --> 01:45:15,550
You can be so gentlemanly, Dad

1703
01:45:18,160 --> 01:45:20,320
How can you leave just like that

1704
01:45:20,460 --> 01:45:22,590
Don't forget you've killed Little Mosquito

1705
01:45:22,700 --> 01:45:23,890
I would be left alone if you leave

1706
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,120
Our house would become so
cold like a big fridge

1707
01:45:26,200 --> 01:45:27,460
You want me to freeze to death?

1708
01:45:28,330 --> 01:45:29,670
Stay and continue to help me

1709
01:45:30,570 --> 01:45:31,090
Okay?

1710
01:45:33,010 --> 01:45:34,060
Thank you boss

1711
01:45:47,790 --> 01:45:50,580
- Green Dragon, hurry up - Sassy

1712
01:45:50,690 --> 01:45:51,950
Nine Circles

1713
01:45:56,330 --> 01:45:58,630
- Be careful - Hurry up

1714
01:45:58,760 --> 01:46:00,360
- Two Circles - Pong

1715
01:46:00,500 --> 01:46:02,020
You're so stupid

1716
01:46:02,840 --> 01:46:04,030
There's no fool in mahjong

1717
01:46:04,140 --> 01:46:05,330
what matters most is to be happy, right?

1718
01:46:05,470 --> 01:46:07,130
- Don't scold him - One Circle

1719
01:46:07,540 --> 01:46:10,170
Why do the kitchens of these
rich people feel so hot?

1720
01:46:11,540 --> 01:46:14,770
Oh, that's because you are clinging onto me.
Food must be served on time during CNY

1721
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:16,440
Didn't you say you like it
when I pretend to be a koala bear?

1722
01:46:16,550 --> 01:46:17,740
Brother

1723
01:46:17,850 --> 01:46:19,720
This is the kitchen, not the bedroom

1724
01:46:19,850 --> 01:46:21,650
I asked you to cook rice,
not fry rice (make love)

1725
01:46:21,720 --> 01:46:23,980
It's been 20 over years, I can't help myself

1726
01:46:24,690 --> 01:46:25,450
Speaking of which

1727
01:46:25,560 --> 01:46:26,890
The Legendary Kungfu that Master taught you

1728
01:46:26,990 --> 01:46:28,980
what was it for?

1729
01:46:29,830 --> 01:46:30,760
How did he know?

1730
01:46:30,860 --> 01:46:33,020
I think those vegetables have been overcooked

1731
01:46:33,170 --> 01:46:34,760
Boss

1732
01:46:34,830 --> 01:46:36,390
You've got mail

1733
01:46:37,270 --> 01:46:38,030
Brother

1734
01:46:38,900 --> 01:46:41,460
- Seems like it's from master - Yes

1735
01:46:48,250 --> 01:46:50,980
Ah Fatt, Ah You, this is your master

1736
01:46:51,550 --> 01:46:53,420
Excuse me, please come back

1737
01:46:53,550 --> 01:46:55,210
Ah Fatt, Ah You, how have you two been

1738
01:46:55,350 --> 01:46:56,250
- Master - First of all, congratulations

1739
01:46:56,390 --> 01:46:58,050
I heard you're still the King of Mahjong

1740
01:46:58,190 --> 01:46:59,890
I'm so proud of you, and happy for you

1741
01:46:59,990 --> 01:47:02,860
But nothing beats knowing you two
are on good terms again

1742
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:04,020
That is great news indeed

1743
01:47:04,160 --> 01:47:05,260
Master is doing really great over here

1744
01:47:05,400 --> 01:47:06,830
I have blondes as my disciples

1745
01:47:06,930 --> 01:47:09,700
Business is booming
and they all call me professor

1746
01:47:09,800 --> 01:47:11,670
Professor

1747
01:47:11,770 --> 01:47:13,900
America is a democratic country

1748
01:47:14,040 --> 01:47:15,370
They're all very open-minded

1749
01:47:15,470 --> 01:47:17,140
Your master practises the
Legendary Kungfu, right

1750
01:47:17,240 --> 01:47:18,500
Have you been practising the great condor?

1751
01:47:18,610 --> 01:47:20,240
I'm not going back anymore,
it's so much better here

1752
01:47:20,380 --> 01:47:22,010
Remember the "great condor", Ah Fatt

1753
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:22,710
Ah "Fatt"?

1754
01:47:22,780 --> 01:47:24,440
Not this "Fatt", I meant that "Fatt"

1755
01:47:24,880 --> 01:47:26,280
Alright that's all, bye

1756
01:47:26,390 --> 01:47:28,620
Shut it down, bye

1757
01:47:28,720 --> 01:47:29,550
Your turn

1758
01:47:29,690 --> 01:47:31,590
- Let's snap some pictures - Stand here

1759
01:47:32,090 --> 01:47:33,560
This is for big brother

1760
01:47:33,660 --> 01:47:35,590
Come on, look this way

1761
01:47:46,410 --> 01:47:49,030
- Sorry, master - It's okay

1762
01:47:49,140 --> 01:47:51,580
Remember not to tell anyone
I'm practising the Legendary Kungfu

1763
01:47:51,640 --> 01:47:52,540
I won't

1764
01:47:52,640 --> 01:47:54,980
You're practising the Legendary Kungfu
for mahjong, right?

1765
01:47:55,110 --> 01:47:58,520
It is the Legendary Kungfu a right,
but not for mahjong

1766
01:47:58,620 --> 01:48:00,480
They're for the "condor"

1767
01:48:00,620 --> 01:48:02,380
Condor?

1768
01:48:02,490 --> 01:48:03,980
Mahjong players spend a lot of time seated

1769
01:48:04,090 --> 01:48:05,680
which is very bad for the prostate

1770
01:48:07,690 --> 01:48:09,090
I get it now

1771
01:48:13,470 --> 01:48:15,060
Come here

1772
01:48:16,440 --> 01:48:17,560
Brother

1773
01:48:17,670 --> 01:48:19,570
You said after listening
to master's recording

1774
01:48:19,670 --> 01:48:20,930
You regained your confidence to play mahjong

1775
01:48:21,010 --> 01:48:23,000
Did master leave any message for me?

1776
01:48:24,680 --> 01:48:26,040
Yes or no?

1777
01:48:38,020 --> 01:48:40,650
If I press this button,
everything will be history

1778
01:48:40,790 --> 01:48:42,920
How does that make me different from a dog?

1779
01:48:47,170 --> 01:48:49,100
Quit horsing around Ah Fatt

1780
01:48:49,200 --> 01:48:50,230
You think no one knows

1781
01:48:50,340 --> 01:48:52,000
You listened to someone else's message

1782
01:48:52,740 --> 01:48:53,800
Mind your own business

1783
01:48:53,940 --> 01:48:56,200
Ah You won't be coming back to find me

1784
01:48:57,510 --> 01:48:58,770
Scared, aren't you

1785
01:48:59,710 --> 01:49:01,110
Screw you

1786
01:49:01,210 --> 01:49:03,770
How is playing mahjong a gambling addiction

1787
01:49:03,850 --> 01:49:07,410
It's a good form of entertainment

1788
01:49:07,720 --> 01:49:08,950
That's right

1789
01:49:09,020 --> 01:49:10,110
These people betrayed

1790
01:49:10,190 --> 01:49:13,280
the original intent of mahjong

1791
01:49:13,860 --> 01:49:17,060
They should be cursed for eternity

1792
01:49:17,200 --> 01:49:18,790
Punished for their atrocities

1793
01:49:18,900 --> 01:49:20,460
Give them 2 slaps everytime you see them

1794
01:49:20,570 --> 01:49:22,120
4 slaps when you see them the next time

1795
01:49:22,230 --> 01:49:23,830
6 slaps when you see them the third time

1796
01:49:23,900 --> 01:49:25,030
See…

1797
01:49:26,610 --> 01:49:28,000
Therefore

1798
01:49:28,240 --> 01:49:31,870
We have to pay mahjong
with the right attitude

1799
01:49:32,010 --> 01:49:33,740
Play it as a healthy form of entertainment

1800
01:49:33,880 --> 01:49:35,810
Play it to express your love
towards a cultural treasure

1801
01:49:35,910 --> 01:49:38,850
Gong Xi Fa Cai and Happy Lunar New Year

1802
01:49:38,980 --> 01:49:41,610
May you all be surrounded by happiness

1803
01:49:41,690 --> 01:49:43,350
May all your wishes come true

1804
01:49:43,420 --> 01:49:46,480
And you'll have everything
that your heart desires

1805
01:49:46,590 --> 01:49:48,650
Gong Xi Gong X

1806
01:49:48,760 --> 01:49:52,990
Happy Lunar New Year to everyone

1807
01:49:59,440 --> 01:50:03,930
Let's get rich!
