SHUN SHUN FATT DINER

4
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,500
Wait for me.

5
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:52,208
Relax, we're just playing mahjong.

6
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:56,625
Ah Fatt.

7
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:58,333
Give me a helping of Three Great Scholars.

8
00:01:58,416 --> 00:02:00,500
Got it, no problem.

9
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:02,291
{\an8}-On it.
-Be quick.

10
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:03,958
{\an8}LONG JONG YOU NIANG TAU FOOD

11
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:13,750
ENTER THE GAME

12
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:20,958
White Dragon, Red Dragon, Green Dragon.

13
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,500
Isn't that the Three Great Scholars?

14
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:25,416
Sassy, get to work.

15
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,458
Pretty sure she's not here.

16
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,625
Nancy, I've got your West Wind tile.

17
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:56,875
-Let me send you to your doom.
-Pong.

18
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:58,541
Watch it, or you'll meet your doom.

19
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:01,416
-Green Dragon.
-Pong.

20
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,958
You want to win? Dream on.

21
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:07,666
Pong.

22
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,166
Crap.

23
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,958
Pong.

24
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:13,166
Pong again and again.

25
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,541
Don't bite off more than you can chew.

26
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:17,958
Lian, you haven't ordered,
what do you want to eat?

27
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:22,041
I'm hungry, fish balls would be nice.

28
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:24,958
I'm dizzy from all the Pong
that is going around.

29
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:27,541
I need a Panadol.

30
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,750
-Just one capsule.
-One capsule.

31
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,750
White Dragon.

32
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:33,375
Pong.

33
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:35,833
Don't mess it up, can't you see
she's on to a Four Large Blessings hand.

34
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:38,375
Don't make me lose
my grocery money as well.

35
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,083
Will it kill you to just let me win once?

36
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,541
Sure, the weakest hand shall prevail.

37
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:46,125
Show me what you've got, I dare you.

38
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:47,666
North Wind.

39
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,458
You scared me.

40
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:53,000
Tiger, you want a Panadol, right?

41
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,083
I have one.

42
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:58,458
Don't take everything you're offered.

43
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,708
Even if you pick it up yourself,
double check.

44
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,458
Kong.

45
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:16,166
Jinx, jinx, jinx...

46
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:18,250
Kong again.

47
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,916
Jinx, jinx, jinx...

48
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,041
Kong...pay up, please.

49
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:24,583
Here you go again.

50
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,875
Three draws and you couldn't even get it,
you'll lose for sure.

51
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:29,500
It ain't over until it's over.

52
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,666
Come on, Nancy.

53
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,875
Move aside.

54
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:36,708
Jinx, jinx, jinx...

55
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,083
Three Circles.

56
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:41,083
Self-Draw win.

57
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:42,958
Four Small Blessings and three Kongs.

58
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,291
How much do you think
are the total winnings?

59
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:47,208
I'm a newbie at mahjong
but this seems like a big win.

60
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:49,416
Haven't you
heard of "the weakest hand shall prevail"?

61
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,625
You watch out
the ghosts might follow you home.

62
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:55,958
If I knew I'd lose, I'd have gone home
to watch my wives play mahjong.

63
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:58,541
Come on, we're neighbors, don't say that.

64
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:01,458
A little gambling never hurt anyone.

65
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:04,750
We're just having fun.

66
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,583
Come on, pay up.

67
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,125
-There goes my money.
-You little rascal.

68
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:17,041
I asked you to pack Yong tau foo
and here you are playing games.

69
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:18,541
Stand right there, don't run.

70
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:20,125
I will if you stop chasing me.

71
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:23,291
Talking back now?

72
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,625
Self-Draw win.

73
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:32,000
The candy is mine.

74
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,625
You'll even settle for a Chicken Hand?

75
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,250
It'll bring bigger wins.

76
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,916
Didn't you say you only play
but don't gamble?

77
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That's why I only won some candy.

78
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:42,375
And I'm the one who brought the candy.

79
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:45,333
What's the matter? You want some?

80
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:49,125
No, today you're going to learn
how to lose gracefully.

81
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,291
All right,
let's learn about sharing first today.

82
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:00,333
What's the matter?
Don't you want some candy?

83
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Mr. Yang.

84
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:09,666
Well, well, well, look who we have here.

85
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,083
Wayne Yang.

86
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:17,708
Haven't I told you
not to gamble here after school?

87
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:19,541
Which part of that did you not understand?

88
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,625
We weren't gambling.

89
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:24,541
Yeah, don't twist the facts
we were just sharing candy.

90
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:27,375
Did you see us gambling
with your own eyes?

91
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:30,208
Although no money was involved.

92
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:33,416
But playing mahjong is gambling.
And that's wrong.

93
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,083
Playing mahjong doesn't necessarily
mean we're gambling.

94
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:39,208
I was teaching them
mathematics and history.

95
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:43,416
No, you were clearly gambling.
Don't deny it.

96
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,541
Deny? Don't you know?

97
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:50,166
This isn't just mahjong
it's the essence of our culture.

98
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,375
Go!

99
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,625
Mahjong is a card game created in China.

100
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:58,125
Well-known and well-loved
in the whole world.

101
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:02,041
<i>There are many different theories</i>
<i>about its origins.</i>

102
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:04,416
<i>Due to the fact that</i>
<i>it's been around for so long.</i>

103
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,750
<i>Some say that in 500 B.C.</i>

104
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:08,625
<i>when Confucius was travelling</i>
<i>all over China,</i>

105
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:11,666
<i>he created the game, mahjong</i>
<i>to spread his teachings.</i>

106
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:15,125
<i>Using the three tiles of Red Dragon</i>
<i>Green Dragon, and White Dragon</i>

107
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,083
<i>to represent the Three Virtues,</i>

108
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:19,166
<i>love, sincerity and filial piety.</i>

109
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,166
<i>Commonly known as loyalty</i>
<i>filial piety and righteousness.</i>

110
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:28,125
That's all good,
but why do the tiles need to be so big?

111
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:30,000
You...

112
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,625
Such a big tile...

113
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:34,291
Carving such a big tile...

114
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:38,708
Right.

115
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,416
That's good.

116
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:46,375
As time went on,
mahjong kept evolving.

117
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,708
<i>And finally</i>
<i>settled with the 108-tile version,</i>

118
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:51,666
<i>representing the 108 warriors</i>
<i>of the Water Margin Legend.</i>

119
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,833
<i>With the addition of various flower tiles,</i>

120
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:57,083
<i>the whole set has 144 tiles.</i>

121
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,291
This is a flower.

122
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,541
It's the bird.

123
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:09,125
Centipede.

124
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:13,208
It's alive, and it wants to bite me.

125
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:17,375
<i>Every player has 13 tiles</i>
<i>to represent 13 weeks of a season.</i>

126
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:20,666
<i>There are 52 weeks in the four seasons</i>
<i>totaling 364 days.</i>

127
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:25,041
<i>The winning tile represents</i>
<i>the final day of a year.</i>

128
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:28,666
<i>To make it 365 days, one complete year.</i>

129
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:33,958
Master,
is there an ace tile to every suit?

130
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,791
Of course, Little Monkey.

131
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,958
Mah...mahjong.

132
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:42,583
Pay...pay up.

133
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,500
Playing mahjong is
commonly referred to by the Chinese

134
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:53,416
as playing eight rounds or "dry swimming".

135
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,000
<i>A square table is used</i>
<i>for playing mahjong,</i>

136
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:58,541
<i>which represents North, South, East, West.</i>

137
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:02,250
<i>As well as spring, summer,</i>
<i>autumn and winter.</i>

138
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,833
-Four Bamboos.
-I'll take it.

139
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,625
One tile discarded and three players win.

140
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,333
<i>Mahjong has been passed down</i>
<i>for generations.</i>

141
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:19,083
<i>Becoming a form of entertainment</i>
<i>in people's lives.</i>

142
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,458
<i>Even the aunties enjoy a game of mahjong.</i>

143
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:23,833
<i>Mahjong became a form of entertainment</i>
<i>and also a sport.</i>

144
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:26,083
<i>It can foster relationships...</i>

145
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,041
<i>Prevent Alzheimer's...</i>

146
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:37,958
Hurry up...

147
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,791
Finally I'm here.

148
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:51,791
Come on.

149
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,583
Eleven.

150
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:02,083
Two Bamboos.

151
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:05,375
Four Bamboos.

152
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,333
I'll take it.

153
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:10,250
One tile discarded and three players win.

154
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,833
-Where are you going?
-Toilet.

155
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,833
-No way.
-You're wriggling out of this?

156
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:18,291
We've waited for a year
for you to walk to this table.

157
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,333
You might take another two years
to walk to the loo.

158
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:21,625
Pay up before you go.

159
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:26,666
<i>Now it's becoming</i>
<i>more convenient to play mahjong.</i>

160
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,958
<i>It's even available online.</i>

161
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:34,250
<i>We can play mahjong anytime, anywhere.</i>

162
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:39,375
See, they are so well versed in history.

163
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,875
You call this history?
Don't be a bad example to the kids.

164
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:46,750
Everyone learns their history from the TV
these days. Nobody takes it seriously.

165
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:50,125
At least their knowledge of
history has improved.

166
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:53,875
Since picking up mahjong
they've scored full marks in history.

167
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:55,833
What's the matter?
Not willing to admit defeat?

168
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:57,708
Let's have a bet then.

169
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,500
Sure...bring it on.

170
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:02,583
Alright, same rules.

171
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:05,958
If I win, you can't stop them
from coming to play with me.

172
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:10,500
And, you have to
stop bothering me for a week.

173
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:13,416
-And what if I win...
-Okay.

174
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,125
Dinner, movies, whatever you want.

175
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:19,708
Everyone has nine tiles
from One Character to Nine Character.

176
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:22,333
The first to complete the suit will win.

177
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:26,500
Let's go.

178
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:57,833
I'm done.

179
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,125
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, correct.

180
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:06,625
Three, seven, nine, eight,
four, one, five, six, two, wrong.

181
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,125
Sassy won.

182
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:11,208
Mr. Yang lost.

183
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,500
Sir...

184
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:17,041
What a pity.

185
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:19,916
Don't worry sir,
you'll get used to losing.

186
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,166
It's not your first time losing
to Sassy anyway.

187
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,375
Come, let's continue playing.

188
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:30,416
Let's carry on,
he has to go back to teaching.

189
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:54,458
What's the matter? Are you okay?

190
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:57,500
I'm fine, it's just that
you eat with such elegance.

191
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:59,791
As your father, I feel content.

192
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,666
That's great.

193
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,125
-What do you think if...
-All right.

194
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:24,041
-Actually...
-I get it.

195
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:33,208
-She...
-I said cut it.

196
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:35,333
You want me to be like her.

197
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:38,333
Talk softer, be more gentle
like a lady, right?

198
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:42,583
What's so terrible about me now?

199
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:47,750
You are perfect as you are.

200
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:50,125
-But if you could...
-Dad.

201
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:52,500
There are no ifs and buts in this world.

202
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:59,416
I just want you to have a boyfriend.

203
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:02,000
In case, one day, I'm not here anymore.

204
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:04,291
Not here? Where are you going?

205
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,291
Back to meet the one who made me.

206
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:09,208
Why would you
meet God all of a sudden?

207
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:10,958
Not all of a sudden.

208
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:13,916
History tells us, people die.

209
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,500
No, anyone can die except you.

210
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:20,666
You can't leave me alone.

211
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,625
Okay, I won't die then.

212
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,333
That's more like it.

213
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:34,625
But even if I don't die,
you still need to date.

214
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:38,833
I think that Wayne Yang is not bad.

215
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:40,583
You got to be kidding, Dad.

216
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:44,083
Him? Not bad?
He's old-fashioned and dumb.

217
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:46,708
He stutters and he can't
even play mahjong.

218
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:49,333
Every time I play with him, he loses.
What's so good about him?

219
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:51,625
All that can change.

220
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:54,375
Old-fashioned means he's honest.

221
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:55,708
A slow talker is better than
a smooth talker.

222
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:58,416
As for playing mahjong,
it's easy to learn.

223
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:07,750
What are you doing?

224
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:13,833
Hey...

225
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:15,916
Hey...

226
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,041
Are you guys serious?

227
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:21,041
Yep, it's here.

228
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:22,500
Who's making noise here?

229
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:25,125
We're looking for Pak Chong Fatt,
where is he?

230
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,583
What Pak Chong Fatt? Hong Chong Fatt?

231
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,791
There's only Chow Yun Fat.

232
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,458
-Bugger off.
-Wong Tin Ba! Wong Tin Ba!

233
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,000
Who's that guy?

234
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:19,541
He's the World Mahjong Champion
for ten consecutive years.

235
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:23,250
The modern day King of Mahjong,
Wong Tin Ba.

236
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,541
He's got style.

237
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:31,083
What's wrong with the plastic bags today?

238
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,916
The dace also aren't fresh enough.

239
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,541
Sassy,
where did you get those plastic bags?

240
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,875
Where did you get those dace?

241
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:45,750
Hey there handsome,
how many seats do you need?

242
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:49,041
It's been a while, Pak Chong Fatt.

243
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:50,208
What?

244
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:52,291
Pak Chong Fatt.

245
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:54,791
Born on the 9th of October, 1970.

246
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,208
Libra, blood type O.

247
00:16:57,291 --> 00:17:00,125
His passion is to help those in need.

248
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:04,250
Cut the crap.
Tell me what's their relationship.

249
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:07,458
He was taught by the same master
as Wong Tin Ba.

250
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:10,041
Rumor has it that
after they turned on each other,

251
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:13,416
Pak Chong Fatt vanished
from the world of mahjong.

252
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,208
Brother Fatt is Pak Chong Fatt?

253
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,708
Are you sure you got the right person?

254
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:26,166
What do you think?

255
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:29,458
I never thought you could find me here.

256
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,583
How's it going, my little brother?
It's been so long.

257
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,500
Is this invitation for your birthday party
or your daughter's wedding?

258
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,083
It's to challenge you to a duel.

259
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,958
The next mahjong championship
is coming up.

260
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:38,666
I must have a duel with you this time.

261
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:42,000
It's been a while since I've played,
you should stop playing too.

262
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,083
I'll ask you again,
are you up for a duel or not?

263
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,875
-No, thanks.
-Come on.

264
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:49,750
-Nah.
-Come on.

265
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,208
-No, thanks.
-Come on.

266
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:54,041
-Nope.
-For god's sake quit dilly-dallying.

267
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:55,333
Happiness can't be forced.

268
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:57,083
Sometimes you need to take a gamble
for your happiness.

269
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:59,791
You have no choice
because I have chosen you.

270
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,750
I must gamble with you this time.

271
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:51,125
Roasted chicken drumstick.

272
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,916
Such a pity
to become a mute at such a young age.

273
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:03,166
Alright, let's eat now.

274
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,833
-My child...
-I'm not your daughter.

275
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:11,541
I'm not your daughter
and you're not my father.

276
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:13,833
How did you find out?

277
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:17,375
Are you for real? I was just joking.

278
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:18,750
What are you saying?

279
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:21,916
I thought you were mute
turns out you're a retard.

280
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,958
You are as short as I am.

281
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:24,625
Could you possibly be
the daughter of our neighbor, Tall Wai?

282
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:26,500
Doesn't matter, from now on,

283
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,041
you eat yours, I eat mine and
we stay out of each other's way.

284
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:31,041
Why? We're family.

285
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:32,833
Have you ever considered me family?

286
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:35,500
-You seem angry.
-You bet I am.

287
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,250
My father was
the King of Mahjong, Pak Chong Fatt.

288
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,833
And I only know of it now,
and you say we're family?

289
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:42,250
You've kept a lot of things
from me as well.

290
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:43,166
Like what, tell me?

291
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,625
When you sat for your exam,

292
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,333
you watched romance and action videos
instead of studying,

293
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:48,208
and I didn't say anything.

294
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:50,125
All right, stop.

295
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:53,000
It's not that I don't want to tell you,
but you never asked.

296
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,541
Why would I talk about these things
out of the blue?

297
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:57,708
Okay, let me ask you now.

298
00:19:57,791 --> 00:20:00,666
Why sell Yong tau foo
when you can be the King of Mahjong?

299
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,416
Let's eat first before I tell you.

300
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,541
Stop pretending or I'll chase you.

301
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,541
Once upon a time...

302
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,083
Speak Mandarin, sit down.

303
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:16,708
I thought for such an important event
English would be more apt.

304
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:20,333
English? Your English sounds like Tamil.
Don't try too hard.

305
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,958
We'll have to start 20 years ago.

306
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:25,375
Hurry up.

307
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,583
<i>Twenty-five years ago...</i>

308
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:31,666
<i>Zhang Shun You,</i>
<i>the Wong Tin Ba of today,</i>

309
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:37,208
<i>and I learnt mahjong together</i>
<i>from our Master Ru from a very young age.</i>

310
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,000
Five.

311
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:50,250
Mine.

312
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,000
Yours.

313
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:53,750
Mine.

314
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:55,000
Yours.

315
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:56,833
Mine.

316
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:58,041
Yours.

317
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,541
Skip.

318
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,875
Next.

319
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:03,833
Reveal.

320
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,458
The Thirteen Wonders.

321
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:09,333
Your hand decides
the moment the tiles are stacked.

322
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:13,500
If you're not the dealer,
try to put your tiles over here.

323
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,375
Look, they're all Bamboos.

324
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:17,708
Told you...

325
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:20,458
<i>Master always said</i>
<i>you don't win by gambling.</i>

326
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:24,083
<i>Winning or losing is just an illusion,</i>
<i>lose your money but never your life.</i>

327
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:27,125
<i>Only the good-hearted wins.</i>

328
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:31,625
<i>He also said, I often win</i>
<i>because I don't harp on winning or losing.</i>

329
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,750
<i>Is it really that important winning</i>
<i>or losing when playing mahjong?</i>

330
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,875
<i>You win this round</i>
<i>you could well lose the next.</i>

331
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:39,000
<i>What's the big deal?</i>

332
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:41,625
Green Dragon, Four Large Blessings.

333
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,916
You need a single Eight Bamboo
you have a full suite of Bamboos.

334
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,500
You lack a tile of Green Dragon.

335
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:54,291
How should I play this Green Dragon tile?

336
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,500
Fatt, You...

337
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,583
I think it's time.

338
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:05,666
So early? Didn't we just have our lunch?

339
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,208
All you think about is eating.

340
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:10,250
I meant it's time you two have a duel.

341
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:13,708
The winner will succeed me
as the King of Mahjong.

342
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,500
What happens to the loser then?

343
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:17,208
He will become the apprentice
of the King of Mahjong.

344
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:19,291
Might as well be the sidekick.

345
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:23,416
I didn't say anything.

346
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:26,791
All right, best of three rounds.

347
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:28,708
Begin...

348
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:30,875
MASTER OF MAHJONG

349
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:38,708
Five Circles.

350
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:41,541
Game.

351
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:43,750
-The Three Great Scholars.
-Wow, you're good.

352
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:45,416
Wow, the Three Great Scholars.

353
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,208
Thanks for the recognition.

354
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:50,041
All right. Self-Draw. West Wind.

355
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:51,958
Chicken Hand.

356
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:53,750
Damn you.

357
00:22:53,833 --> 00:22:55,083
Why would you even win on a Chicken Hand?

358
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:56,416
You like chicken that much.

359
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,375
Do you even know how to play mahjong?

360
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,958
Green Dragon.

361
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,000
Game.

362
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:24,708
The Thirteen Wonders.

363
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,541
Master, I've won two of the three rounds.

364
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:30,916
I'm your successor, now teach me
the legendary mahjong Kung fu.

365
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:33,375
I'll announce who's the winner.

366
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:34,708
Of course.

367
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:38,541
The winner is...

368
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,291
Ah Fatt.

369
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:43,791
But why?

370
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:45,375
That's the Thirteen Wonders right there.

371
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:48,458
I didn't say the one
who wins will succeed me.

372
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:51,291
You're right.

373
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:52,791
I knew it.

374
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:56,041
No matter how I fare
you'll always see me as the loser.

375
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:58,250
-You, listen to me.
-Say no more.

376
00:23:58,333 --> 00:23:59,541
I've listened to you long enough.

377
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:03,208
You talk all day long.
I've had enough of it.

378
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:05,416
I'm not listening to you anymore.

379
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:08,583
I'm not your disciple anymore.

380
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:18,166
Brother...

381
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:20,958
<i>So that was</i>
<i>how Wong Tin Ba left our master.</i>

382
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:23,333
<i>And went on to challenge everyone</i>
<i>everywhere.</i>

383
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:25,291
<i>From India to Egypt.</i>

384
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:29,083
<i>From Egypt to Japan.</i>
<i>From Japan to China.</i>

385
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:32,750
<i>Challenging the Kings of Mahjong</i>
<i>of every region.</i>

386
00:24:32,833 --> 00:24:34,958
Ninety Thousand.

387
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,750
Red Middle.

388
00:24:37,458 --> 00:24:39,291
Children.

389
00:24:40,958 --> 00:24:42,750
Two Circles.

390
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:51,000
Big Four Happiness. Game.

391
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:10,708
Sensei...

392
00:25:10,916 --> 00:25:14,833
Get rid of the tiles that you don't need
no point keeping them.

393
00:25:14,916 --> 00:25:15,833
Self-Draw.

394
00:25:15,916 --> 00:25:17,833
Why are you discarding
your self-drawn winning tile...

395
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:20,833
Mahjong?

396
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:24,291
Hold on, hold on.

397
00:25:28,541 --> 00:25:30,250
The Three Great Scholars.

398
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:32,333
-After you.
-See you.

399
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,791
<i>Finally,</i>
<i>Wong Tin Ba got what he wished for.</i>

400
00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:10,500
<i>He defeated all the best mahjong players</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

401
00:26:10,583 --> 00:26:13,125
<i>And even won the title of King of Mahjong</i>
<i>for ten consecutive years.</i>

402
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:16,458
But one thing I can't
wrap my head around.

403
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:19,833
You gave up the Green Dragon tile for
Wong Tin Ba, so by right he should've won.

404
00:26:19,916 --> 00:26:22,291
Why did your master announce
you as the winner?

405
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:27,000
Later, Master explained it to me.

406
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:33,041
I've lost, why did you say I won, master?

407
00:26:34,666 --> 00:26:37,041
Do you think I'm a renovation contractor?

408
00:26:37,291 --> 00:26:38,791
I can see.

409
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:42,041
He won in the game of mahjong.

410
00:26:42,125 --> 00:26:44,083
But lost due to his character.

411
00:26:44,166 --> 00:26:46,458
My successor must have good character.

412
00:26:46,541 --> 00:26:48,875
Winning without character is meaningless.

413
00:27:16,666 --> 00:27:19,583
It's been days since I heard from you,
where have you been?

414
00:27:20,416 --> 00:27:21,875
Everywhere.

415
00:27:21,958 --> 00:27:27,291
I've been to wherever I won't see a poker
face a black face and two stupid faces.

416
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:44,041
You two look like
you have a lot of free time.

417
00:27:44,125 --> 00:27:46,041
Why don't you go accompany the boss?

418
00:27:53,916 --> 00:27:55,958
Spend some time with your dad.

419
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:58,083
Don't keep avoiding him.

420
00:27:58,166 --> 00:28:00,541
I'll just be another black face.

421
00:28:00,791 --> 00:28:02,416
Doesn't make a difference.

422
00:28:16,708 --> 00:28:17,833
You find that funny?

423
00:28:17,916 --> 00:28:19,916
Don't you?

424
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,416
Yes.

425
00:28:23,166 --> 00:28:24,750
It's really hilarious.

426
00:28:24,833 --> 00:28:26,541
Why did you hit me?

427
00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:30,333
Hit me? You...

428
00:28:30,416 --> 00:28:32,250
How dare you lay your finger
on the great Wong Tin Ba?

429
00:28:51,458 --> 00:28:53,833
Game, 108 Warriors of...

430
00:28:54,916 --> 00:28:56,166
What are you doing?

431
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,916
There are mosquitos.

432
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,500
I have such a big house.

433
00:28:59,583 --> 00:29:01,666
This mosquito is actually my brother.

434
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,958
He talks to me through his buzzing.

435
00:29:04,041 --> 00:29:05,875
Now that you killed it
who's going to talk to me?

436
00:29:05,958 --> 00:29:07,125
You don't talk to me.

437
00:29:07,208 --> 00:29:09,333
And I don't want to talk to these two.

438
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,458
You three jump into the water.

439
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:14,541
<i>Where did DeeYi Zhang go again?</i>

440
00:29:23,958 --> 00:29:24,791
...right?

441
00:29:24,875 --> 00:29:27,000
There you are.

442
00:29:27,083 --> 00:29:29,500
Baby, who's this?

443
00:29:29,583 --> 00:29:30,541
Who are you?

444
00:29:30,625 --> 00:29:33,583
He should know who I am.

445
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:58,458
Pure Honor Hand.
Four Large Blessings, Full Blossoms.

446
00:29:59,541 --> 00:30:02,666
-That's 88 folds, everybody.
-What a big win?

447
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:04,458
It's nothing.

448
00:30:05,625 --> 00:30:08,666
What are you doing?
Where did the extra tiles come from?

449
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,125
Hey, are you trying to cheat?

450
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:11,583
Cheating?

451
00:30:11,666 --> 00:30:12,875
Are you kidding me?

452
00:30:12,958 --> 00:30:14,750
It's written here "No cheating".

453
00:30:14,833 --> 00:30:16,541
Do you think I'm blind?
Do you think I'm stupid?

454
00:30:16,625 --> 00:30:19,083
Stop mucking about,
do you know what you're talking about?

455
00:30:19,166 --> 00:30:21,750
They say bringing mahjong tiles
around this year brings good luck.

456
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:24,083
And you thought I'm cheating...

457
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,625
What took him so long?

458
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:32,041
-Do you know what time it is now?
-Must've come from here.

459
00:30:32,125 --> 00:30:35,000
What's with the crowd?
Did Michelle Yeoh turn up?

460
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,583
All the neighbors want you
to be their master.

461
00:30:37,666 --> 00:30:38,833
I'm number 15 in line.

462
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:40,625
You people are crazy.

463
00:30:40,708 --> 00:30:43,208
-When did I say I'm accepting students?
-You're Pak Chong Fatt.

464
00:30:43,291 --> 00:30:46,041
The first ever King of Mahjong,
of course we'd like to learn from you.

465
00:30:46,125 --> 00:30:48,416
If you're here for the Tofu,
I'm more than happy.

466
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:51,833
But if you're here to learn mahjong,
please leave.

467
00:30:59,916 --> 00:31:02,375
Master, I've been having
a bad hand in mahjong.

468
00:31:02,458 --> 00:31:04,375
Any tips?

469
00:31:04,458 --> 00:31:07,083
That's your fate.

470
00:31:07,166 --> 00:31:09,208
Don't ask me, how would I know?

471
00:31:09,291 --> 00:31:13,208
Why are two of you holding me down
instead of standing in line?

472
00:31:13,291 --> 00:31:16,625
I listen better and learn more this way.

473
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,083
My reason is simple,
I just want to touch you.

474
00:31:19,791 --> 00:31:21,875
Do it on me first.

475
00:31:28,208 --> 00:31:31,791
-You're such a pain.
-Come on, teach me a few tricks.

476
00:31:34,708 --> 00:31:37,625
Which one of you is Pak Chong Fatt?

477
00:31:41,958 --> 00:31:45,083
I am, what's the matter?

478
00:31:47,041 --> 00:31:49,375
-Who?
-Surely not me.

479
00:31:49,458 --> 00:31:50,833
It's him.

480
00:31:50,916 --> 00:31:52,791
You two idiots.

481
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,875
It's me.

482
00:31:55,958 --> 00:31:57,375
Miss, may I know what you're doing here?

483
00:31:57,458 --> 00:32:01,208
I suppose you don't remember
the King of Gai Hu?

484
00:32:02,208 --> 00:32:05,541
The one who I defeated
in the inaugural championship?

485
00:32:05,625 --> 00:32:07,166
That's right, he's my father.

486
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:08,458
So you're his daughter.

487
00:32:08,791 --> 00:32:10,000
Come and give Uncle Fatt a hug.

488
00:32:12,708 --> 00:32:13,708
Go on.

489
00:32:15,375 --> 00:32:19,875
That year,
he made it to the finals against all odds.

490
00:32:19,958 --> 00:32:22,083
But you beat him hands down.

491
00:32:22,166 --> 00:32:24,166
Since then he's become like this.

492
00:32:26,125 --> 00:32:28,000
Never to smile again.

493
00:32:28,083 --> 00:32:30,083
All right, since you're here,

494
00:32:30,166 --> 00:32:32,625
I'll let you have vengeance.

495
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,291
You two, go distract her.

496
00:32:35,291 --> 00:32:37,291
Actually, we...

497
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:41,458
Let's have a duel.

498
00:32:41,541 --> 00:32:43,375
-Hey, you.
-You're up.

499
00:32:43,791 --> 00:32:45,833
I already said
I've forgotten how to play mahjong.

500
00:32:45,916 --> 00:32:47,375
If you don't play, you'll get it from us.

501
00:32:47,458 --> 00:32:49,458
Come on, if not now then when?

502
00:32:49,541 --> 00:32:51,458
If you don't play
we'll annoy the hell out of you.

503
00:32:51,541 --> 00:32:53,500
-I'll pester you.
-Won't leave you alone.

504
00:32:53,583 --> 00:32:54,583
Come on, play with her.

505
00:32:57,416 --> 00:32:58,500
All right then.

506
00:32:59,541 --> 00:33:01,000
Let's do this.

507
00:33:12,875 --> 00:33:14,916
-Four Circles.
-Pong.

508
00:33:16,958 --> 00:33:17,958
East Wind.

509
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:21,916
One Circle.

510
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,208
Pong. One Circle,
here's a Four Circles tile.

511
00:33:25,291 --> 00:33:27,125
Lucky you, getting the final tile.

512
00:33:29,125 --> 00:33:30,708
South Wind.

513
00:33:30,791 --> 00:33:35,083
<i>Want to make a Pure Hand of Circle?</i>
<i>Watch me spoil it.</i>

514
00:33:39,166 --> 00:33:40,625
Eight Circles.

515
00:33:40,708 --> 00:33:42,250
Pong.

516
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:44,750
Nine Circles.

517
00:33:44,833 --> 00:33:47,125
Pong, here's a Seven Circles.

518
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:48,916
Pong. Seven Circles.

519
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,375
Nine Pieces Penalty,
it's on you if he wins.

520
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,250
I'm sorry, Hidden Six Circles Kong.

521
00:34:00,333 --> 00:34:02,125
Self-Draw win on Replacement Tile.

522
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:05,041
I must win to make my father smile again.

523
00:34:08,958 --> 00:34:10,416
Five Circles.

524
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,625
Get a Self-Draw win, come on.

525
00:34:16,291 --> 00:34:17,208
Kong.

526
00:34:20,791 --> 00:34:23,250
Eight Circles.

527
00:34:42,875 --> 00:34:43,958
Two Character.

528
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:45,416
I'll take that Two Character.

529
00:34:46,958 --> 00:34:48,541
I'll discard a One Character.

530
00:34:49,625 --> 00:34:51,583
Game.

531
00:34:51,666 --> 00:34:53,291
What?

532
00:34:53,375 --> 00:34:55,750
You're waiting for a single tile
of One Character, snatch her game.

533
00:34:56,291 --> 00:34:57,750
That's none of your business.

534
00:34:57,833 --> 00:34:59,625
Are you playing or am I playing?

535
00:34:59,708 --> 00:35:02,833
They came so far for revenge, winning
on a Chicken Hand doesn't make sense.

536
00:35:03,916 --> 00:35:06,041
Chicken Hand, are you for real?

537
00:35:06,125 --> 00:35:07,916
That's a bit too lame, don't you think?

538
00:35:08,208 --> 00:35:11,916
It's called a Chicken Hand,
of course it's lame.

539
00:35:14,125 --> 00:35:17,458
I've waited 20 years for this.

540
00:35:17,541 --> 00:35:20,125
I finally got my revenge.

541
00:35:20,208 --> 00:35:22,500
To be able to play with a mahjong expert
like Pak Chong Fatt.

542
00:35:24,166 --> 00:35:26,875
Look, your father is smiling again.

543
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,625
You shouldn't
have waited so long for that.

544
00:35:28,708 --> 00:35:33,041
If you had understood this 20 years ago,
you wouldn't have been upset for so long.

545
00:35:33,125 --> 00:35:35,833
Playing mahjong is just
a form of entertainment.

546
00:35:35,916 --> 00:35:37,166
When it's done, get on with it.

547
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:38,458
That's a load of bull.

548
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:41,458
Remember what I taught you?

549
00:35:41,541 --> 00:35:43,333
What should be done after you've lost?

550
00:35:49,458 --> 00:35:50,916
What do you want?

551
00:35:59,041 --> 00:36:00,458
Good manners.

552
00:36:01,666 --> 00:36:03,083
Thank you.

553
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:11,541
Don't even think of kissing me,
I'll hit you.

554
00:36:21,708 --> 00:36:22,916
Ramona.

555
00:36:25,333 --> 00:36:27,166
It really is you.

556
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:30,625
Sir, have you seen my husband?

557
00:36:31,666 --> 00:36:34,250
What's the matter with you?
Don't you recognize me?

558
00:36:34,333 --> 00:36:36,041
I'm your husband, Fatt.

559
00:36:36,916 --> 00:36:38,041
It can't be.

560
00:36:38,125 --> 00:36:40,958
My husband is very handsome.

561
00:36:41,041 --> 00:36:43,166
He's tall and macho.

562
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:44,916
And he's very good at mahjong.

563
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,916
Look.

564
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:50,500
Take a good look at yourself.

565
00:37:06,541 --> 00:37:08,958
Not the breast, the tattoo.

566
00:37:09,041 --> 00:37:10,708
It's the same, look.

567
00:37:11,875 --> 00:37:15,083
This type of tattoo is so common.

568
00:37:16,833 --> 00:37:20,458
My husband is so handsome, so macho.

569
00:37:20,541 --> 00:37:24,166
But you're short and stout
and you look so shifty.

570
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:25,375
And you stink.

571
00:37:25,458 --> 00:37:26,875
How could you be my husband?

572
00:37:26,958 --> 00:37:30,166
There are so many people here,
can you cut me some slack?

573
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:34,458
-But you're not my husband.
-I really am your husband.

574
00:37:34,541 --> 00:37:35,708
You're not.

575
00:37:35,791 --> 00:37:38,500
-I am. I am.
-You're not. You're not.

576
00:37:39,833 --> 00:37:43,125
You leave me with no choice
but to share this with everyone.

577
00:37:43,208 --> 00:37:45,083
Your body anatomy is very weird.

578
00:37:45,166 --> 00:37:46,500
If I touch you here, you'll scream.

579
00:37:47,166 --> 00:37:48,583
If I touch you here, you'll get excited.

580
00:37:49,416 --> 00:37:51,500
If I touch your head, you'll be obedient.

581
00:37:51,583 --> 00:37:53,625
Am I right?

582
00:37:55,041 --> 00:37:56,083
Shut up.

583
00:37:56,166 --> 00:37:57,375
How come you know so much about me?

584
00:37:57,458 --> 00:37:59,541
Because I'm your husband.

585
00:38:01,958 --> 00:38:04,041
-Fatt?
-Yes.

586
00:38:05,458 --> 00:38:06,833
Come on.

587
00:38:06,916 --> 00:38:08,375
Where is this place?

588
00:38:08,458 --> 00:38:11,208
This is not a common place,
it's Brother Fatt's house.

589
00:38:11,291 --> 00:38:14,125
-Isn't that my house?
-Yes.

590
00:38:15,875 --> 00:38:17,833
Nan Yang.

591
00:38:17,916 --> 00:38:21,125
Don't I come from a rich family?

592
00:38:21,208 --> 00:38:22,708
Come, sit down.

593
00:38:22,791 --> 00:38:24,291
I'll get you a drink.

594
00:38:24,375 --> 00:38:26,500
Sassy, we have a guest.

595
00:38:35,416 --> 00:38:36,833
Look who's here.

596
00:38:36,916 --> 00:38:38,291
Who's so important?

597
00:38:38,375 --> 00:38:40,375
See for yourself.

598
00:38:40,458 --> 00:38:43,375
Hey, is this your wife?

599
00:38:43,458 --> 00:38:46,333
His wife? She left a long time ago.

600
00:38:46,416 --> 00:38:49,041
Why is your wife so bad?

601
00:38:49,125 --> 00:38:51,833
That's not all,
she's materialistic and greedy.

602
00:38:51,916 --> 00:38:54,416
-Ridiculous, shameless...
-Sassy.

603
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,125
How can you insult your mother
when she's right in front of you?

604
00:38:57,208 --> 00:38:58,291
At least turn around.

605
00:38:58,375 --> 00:39:00,041
This is your mother.

606
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:01,458
-My mother?
-My daughter?

607
00:39:01,541 --> 00:39:02,750
That is correct.

608
00:39:02,833 --> 00:39:05,166
Your mother's daughter is you...right
that makes her your mother!

609
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:06,500
Why did you bring her home?

610
00:39:06,583 --> 00:39:09,083
Don't tell me
we need to seek your permission first.

611
00:39:09,166 --> 00:39:10,750
This is my home, not yours.

612
00:39:10,833 --> 00:39:13,375
Hey, you said this is my home,
isn't it? Ah Fatt's home?

613
00:39:13,458 --> 00:39:16,708
Your home has been broken since
you left us when I was two years old.

614
00:39:16,791 --> 00:39:19,583
Stop arguing.

615
00:39:19,833 --> 00:39:20,958
Yes.

616
00:39:21,041 --> 00:39:24,333
I know this is a bit too sudden for you.

617
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:26,125
It's the same for me.

618
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:29,958
I saw her alone today,
looking for her husband on the streets.

619
00:39:30,583 --> 00:39:32,208
Isn't she looking for me?

620
00:39:32,541 --> 00:39:35,041
But she couldn't recognize me
even though I'm so handsome.

621
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:36,500
The only thing she recognizes
is money anyway.

622
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:38,625
Don't be fooled by her.

623
00:39:38,708 --> 00:39:39,791
I'm not that stupid.

624
00:39:39,875 --> 00:39:41,458
I took her to the doctor
and the doctor said,

625
00:39:41,541 --> 00:39:44,708
apparently, a year after she left us,
she lost her memory after an accident.

626
00:39:44,791 --> 00:39:45,875
Lost her memory?

627
00:39:45,958 --> 00:39:49,083
Is this some sort of lame soap opera plot?

628
00:39:49,166 --> 00:39:51,416
Soap operas are indeed lame.

629
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:54,083
But she really is your mother.

630
00:39:57,833 --> 00:40:01,333
It hasn't been easy for her
being alone all these years.

631
00:40:01,416 --> 00:40:04,875
You'll understand these matters
of the heart when you grow up.

632
00:40:11,458 --> 00:40:12,875
You can see for yourself.

633
00:40:12,958 --> 00:40:15,500
Who in their right mind
eats mahjong tiles?

634
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:21,916
What? I'm hungry.

635
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,791
You're not supposed to eat mahjong tiles.

636
00:40:23,875 --> 00:40:26,041
I'll cook for you if you are hungry.

637
00:40:26,125 --> 00:40:27,916
Let's go outside.

638
00:40:32,291 --> 00:40:34,166
Loss of memory?

639
00:40:37,958 --> 00:40:41,166
Mom... Let me teach you
how to play mahjong today.

640
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:43,750
Mahjong? Is it fun?

641
00:40:43,833 --> 00:40:45,166
It's okay if you don't know.

642
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:48,875
Within a few days, and a few losses,
you'll get the hang of it.

643
00:40:48,958 --> 00:40:50,708
Come on.

644
00:40:50,791 --> 00:40:52,125
I've got no money.

645
00:40:52,208 --> 00:40:54,000
If I lose
I only have my daughter to offer you.

646
00:40:54,083 --> 00:40:55,708
Let's restart the game
since she just sat down.

647
00:40:55,791 --> 00:40:57,250
-Sure.
-Let's go.

648
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,166
Eight Circles.

649
00:41:05,708 --> 00:41:07,041
Nine Character.

650
00:41:08,125 --> 00:41:09,291
Can I win now?

651
00:41:09,375 --> 00:41:11,000
You don't have enough folds.

652
00:41:11,083 --> 00:41:14,375
Just follow whatever the others are doing.

653
00:41:14,791 --> 00:41:16,541
Discard that Nine Character tile.

654
00:41:22,125 --> 00:41:23,916
Three Character.

655
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,583
Can I win now?

656
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,625
How is it possible
that you can still win?

657
00:41:30,708 --> 00:41:33,083
Self-Draw, game.

658
00:41:33,166 --> 00:41:34,583
The Thirteen Wonders.

659
00:41:34,666 --> 00:41:36,541
You scared the daylight out of me.

660
00:41:43,416 --> 00:41:45,916
I can't see through this mess.

661
00:41:48,583 --> 00:41:51,375
Eight-and-a-half Pairs. Pure Hand.

662
00:41:51,458 --> 00:41:52,666
Is that a big win?

663
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:54,208
I win.

664
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:57,375
Pay up.

665
00:42:19,125 --> 00:42:20,166
Five Bamboos.

666
00:42:27,583 --> 00:42:28,708
Self-Draw.

667
00:42:28,791 --> 00:42:30,500
Nine Gates Hand.

668
00:42:31,208 --> 00:42:32,666
Pay up, please.

669
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:35,875
Are you sure you are crazy?
It really doesn't seem like it.

670
00:42:35,958 --> 00:42:36,958
Thank you.

671
00:42:37,041 --> 00:42:38,916
When are we going to play again?

672
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,416
Come earlier tomorrow
and you can play with yourself.

673
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,708
Who's going to play with you again?

674
00:42:43,791 --> 00:42:45,625
First time and we've already lost so much.

675
00:42:45,708 --> 00:42:48,250
Do you know how many people
I'll have to massage to earn this much?

676
00:42:48,458 --> 00:42:50,291
I lost my grocery money again.

677
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:53,875
Girl, they are such sore losers.

678
00:42:53,958 --> 00:42:56,791
Ignore them, we're rich.

679
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,041
What are you doing?

680
00:43:08,333 --> 00:43:09,541
Sewing on some buttons.

681
00:43:09,625 --> 00:43:13,333
I saw the buttons on your father's
clothes, they don't match.

682
00:43:13,416 --> 00:43:15,041
Every single one of them.

683
00:43:15,125 --> 00:43:18,416
If you really cared for him
you wouldn't have left.

684
00:43:23,291 --> 00:43:26,208
I was wrong.

685
00:43:26,291 --> 00:43:30,875
I thought I could live a good life
having married the King of Mahjong.

686
00:43:30,958 --> 00:43:34,291
But he suddenly quit.

687
00:43:34,375 --> 00:43:36,875
I got angry, so I left in a fit of anger.

688
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,291
I never thought it'd be
so hard to turn back.

689
00:43:44,416 --> 00:43:47,125
I know you both are still mad at me.

690
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:49,458
I've got nothing to say.

691
00:43:51,541 --> 00:43:54,000
If you really don't want to see me,

692
00:43:54,083 --> 00:43:56,666
I can leave any time.

693
00:44:00,041 --> 00:44:02,500
I'm really leaving.

694
00:44:08,625 --> 00:44:11,083
Take care of your father, I'm leaving.

695
00:44:11,416 --> 00:44:14,250
You come and go as you please,
you think this is a hotel?

696
00:44:14,583 --> 00:44:17,208
I've taken care of your husband
all these years.

697
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:19,541
It's your turn now.

698
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,458
One more thing.

699
00:44:25,333 --> 00:44:28,250
Don't be fooled by his carefree outlook.

700
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:30,458
He's never forgotten you.

701
00:44:30,791 --> 00:44:32,500
Take good care of him.

702
00:45:02,791 --> 00:45:06,083
It's so hot.

703
00:45:23,666 --> 00:45:27,041
I want to be a responsible husband.

704
00:45:33,041 --> 00:45:34,958
What Kung fu is he practicing?

705
00:45:35,041 --> 00:45:37,375
Could it be the legendary mahjong Kung fu?

706
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:49,375
So you've invited yourself.

707
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:55,000
Drinking alcohol in broad day light.

708
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,875
Sassy doesn't care about me anymore.

709
00:45:58,958 --> 00:46:00,458
What makes you say that?

710
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:04,708
She's been ignoring me...
I think it's time to let her go.

711
00:46:04,791 --> 00:46:06,541
She only cares for her mom right now.

712
00:46:06,625 --> 00:46:09,958
What about my life? I'm hopeless.

713
00:46:10,041 --> 00:46:11,500
So that's what you think?

714
00:46:11,583 --> 00:46:14,208
You're too pessimistic.

715
00:46:14,291 --> 00:46:16,625
I know my daughter.

716
00:46:16,708 --> 00:46:18,916
Her anger comes and goes.

717
00:46:19,958 --> 00:46:22,708
It doesn't matter if she's angry with me.

718
00:46:22,791 --> 00:46:27,000
The point is
I don't have a place in her heart.

719
00:46:27,083 --> 00:46:29,166
I'm not important to her.

720
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:34,083
If that's the case,
then why would she have wagers with you?

721
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,208
Because she wants to defeat me.

722
00:46:36,291 --> 00:46:37,958
She wants me to back off.

723
00:46:39,125 --> 00:46:40,333
<i>That silly girl.</i>

724
00:46:40,416 --> 00:46:44,458
<i>Every time she plays mahjong with you</i>
<i>she looks at you in a different way.</i>

725
00:46:44,541 --> 00:46:47,416
<i>Doesn't that prove that she likes you?</i>

726
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:50,083
Remember, to be a good man,

727
00:46:50,166 --> 00:46:52,791
one must not be greedy.

728
00:46:52,875 --> 00:46:54,958
And one must not be impatient.

729
00:46:55,041 --> 00:46:59,416
Even if you have the lousiest hand,
don't be afraid.

730
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:03,083
Sometimes, to lose is to win.

731
00:47:03,625 --> 00:47:05,375
Get it?

732
00:47:06,583 --> 00:47:10,500
To lose is to win.

733
00:47:13,666 --> 00:47:16,875
I get it.

734
00:47:16,958 --> 00:47:18,791
Thank you.

735
00:47:18,875 --> 00:47:20,750
I understand now.

736
00:47:20,833 --> 00:47:23,458
Thank you.

737
00:47:23,541 --> 00:47:26,875
Sassy, here I come.

738
00:47:26,958 --> 00:47:30,208
Most handsome guys in this world are dumb.

739
00:47:32,208 --> 00:47:35,291
Sassy is having a duel
with Mr. Yang again.

740
00:47:37,208 --> 00:47:38,958
Ready? Go.

741
00:47:48,458 --> 00:47:51,916
So fast? Reveal what you have.

742
00:47:53,208 --> 00:47:56,125
Sir, don't you know one, two, three?

743
00:47:56,208 --> 00:47:57,666
What are you doing?

744
00:47:58,083 --> 00:47:59,166
Are you trying to be funny?

745
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:00,833
Sorry.

746
00:48:00,916 --> 00:48:02,916
Give me one last chance.

747
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,250
One last chance, let's do this again.

748
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,791
<i>Every time she plays mahjong with you</i>
<i>she looks at you in a different way.</i>

749
00:48:25,833 --> 00:48:28,375
Wow, Sassy wins again.

750
00:48:28,458 --> 00:48:30,291
But Mr. Yang completed his hand first.

751
00:48:30,375 --> 00:48:31,666
So what?

752
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:33,083
I'm pretty sure it's a mess again.

753
00:48:33,166 --> 00:48:34,500
Reveal.

754
00:48:36,375 --> 00:48:38,458
Wow, Mr. Yang.

755
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:41,208
You're good, you've won.

756
00:48:43,083 --> 00:48:45,833
Very good, you've defeated me
Don't look for me anymore.

757
00:48:46,166 --> 00:48:47,416
Sassy.

758
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:50,208
Sassy.

759
00:48:50,875 --> 00:48:52,208
What do you want?

760
00:48:53,291 --> 00:48:54,875
You earlier said,

761
00:48:54,958 --> 00:48:57,416
if I want to date you,
I'll have to defeat you first.

762
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,166
So can I ask you out on a date now?

763
00:49:00,541 --> 00:49:01,750
Fine.

764
00:49:01,833 --> 00:49:04,458
But I'm telling you
I have no feelings for you.

765
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:07,833
Then why is it that
whenever I play mahjong with you,

766
00:49:07,916 --> 00:49:10,958
you gaze at me so gently?

767
00:49:15,041 --> 00:49:16,416
Rubbish.

768
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:27,916
Fatt told me.

769
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,500
As long as you're the apple of my eye
and vice versa,

770
00:49:31,583 --> 00:49:34,250
winning or losing isn't important at all.

771
00:49:37,833 --> 00:49:39,583
I...

772
00:49:40,916 --> 00:49:42,291
Let's be together.

773
00:49:59,958 --> 00:50:01,958
Apparently, when you fall for someone,

774
00:50:02,041 --> 00:50:05,916
you'll feel happy
even when he defeats you.

775
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,750
That's life.
But hey what's wrong with that?

776
00:50:09,833 --> 00:50:13,625
From the moment you fell for him
you've already lost.

777
00:50:14,541 --> 00:50:15,916
Dad...

778
00:50:16,375 --> 00:50:18,750
You're such an expert in love.

779
00:50:18,833 --> 00:50:21,208
So why did you break up with mom?

780
00:50:25,458 --> 00:50:27,375
Because of love.

781
00:50:27,458 --> 00:50:29,375
We went separate ways.

782
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:36,791
<i>Your mom and I grew up together.</i>

783
00:50:36,875 --> 00:50:38,916
<i>She was the girl that everyone coveted.</i>

784
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,916
<i>Smart and pretty.</i>

785
00:50:41,291 --> 00:50:42,708
<i>Good at mahjong too.</i>

786
00:50:42,791 --> 00:50:45,916
<i>She was known as...</i>
<i>The Queen of Thirteen Wonders.</i>

787
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,041
<i>Look at her smile.</i>

788
00:50:49,708 --> 00:50:51,500
<i>Makes my heart skip a beat.</i>

789
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:02,791
<i>We got married later on.</i>

790
00:51:02,875 --> 00:51:06,666
<i>I won the World Mahjong Championship</i>
<i>that year.</i>

791
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:09,750
<i>And became the King of Mahjong.</i>

792
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:30,083
Are you sure?

793
00:51:30,166 --> 00:51:31,916
I really can't take it anymore.

794
00:51:32,541 --> 00:51:34,458
<i>-Ramona and I were soulmates.</i>
<i>-Is that necessary?</i>

795
00:51:34,541 --> 00:51:38,125
<i>Since when we used to date</i>
<i>we enjoyed playing mahjong together.</i>

796
00:51:38,208 --> 00:51:40,333
Such a lovely couple.

797
00:51:40,416 --> 00:51:42,500
Hubby...

798
00:51:42,583 --> 00:51:46,958
<i>She was the only person who could</i>
<i>defeat me at the mahjong table.</i>

799
00:51:47,041 --> 00:51:50,250
This Green Dragon tile is annoying me,
watch me discard it.

800
00:51:52,166 --> 00:51:54,916
Four Large Blessings, pay up.

801
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,375
You knew she wanted the Green Dragon,
yet you discarded it.

802
00:51:57,666 --> 00:51:59,916
Men.

803
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,666
Hubby, quick, pay up.

804
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:03,000
What's going on.

805
00:52:03,083 --> 00:52:05,083
-What's going on?
-She's giving birth, give me that?

806
00:52:06,208 --> 00:52:08,250
<i>Ramona gave birth soon after.</i>

807
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:10,791
<i>That was the happiest time of our lives.</i>

808
00:52:10,875 --> 00:52:12,625
Six Circles.

809
00:52:12,708 --> 00:52:14,416
Sassy.

810
00:52:17,708 --> 00:52:18,666
Two Circles.

811
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:20,791
<i>But good times never last.</i>

812
00:52:20,875 --> 00:52:24,083
<i>Before the second</i>
<i>World Mahjong Championships,</i>

813
00:52:24,166 --> 00:52:26,958
<i>I was very stressed.</i>

814
00:52:27,041 --> 00:52:32,208
<i>I was terrified of losing my status</i>
<i>as the world champion.</i>

815
00:52:34,333 --> 00:52:35,708
<i>At that moment,</i>

816
00:52:35,791 --> 00:52:39,458
<i>I realized playing mahjong</i>
<i>no longer means the same anymore.</i>

817
00:52:40,916 --> 00:52:43,083
<i>I started having second thoughts.</i>

818
00:52:53,166 --> 00:52:55,083
Hubby,

819
00:52:55,166 --> 00:52:57,250
I've cooked some ginseng chicken.

820
00:52:57,333 --> 00:53:00,916
To help you become
the King of Mahjong for the second time.

821
00:53:02,416 --> 00:53:04,625
I'm a little reluctant to go.

822
00:53:05,666 --> 00:53:07,750
Why?

823
00:53:07,833 --> 00:53:09,750
I feel like...

824
00:53:09,833 --> 00:53:12,250
Playing mahjong
for the sake of competition

825
00:53:12,333 --> 00:53:14,458
seems to be deviating
from its original intent.

826
00:53:14,541 --> 00:53:16,458
As long as you win every time.

827
00:53:16,541 --> 00:53:18,625
What other purpose do you need?

828
00:53:19,083 --> 00:53:21,208
That's not what the master taught me.

829
00:53:23,458 --> 00:53:24,750
I'm warning you.

830
00:53:24,833 --> 00:53:28,291
I'm investing my youth in you
I saw a bright future in you.

831
00:53:28,375 --> 00:53:30,375
I won't allow you to give up.

832
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:32,833
Ramona, don't go.

833
00:53:32,916 --> 00:53:35,375
What's going to happen
to me and Sassy if you leave?

834
00:53:35,458 --> 00:53:37,458
My husband, the King of Mahjong
is now a useless man.

835
00:53:37,541 --> 00:53:40,208
Why should I stay?

836
00:53:40,291 --> 00:53:42,458
What will it take to make you stay?

837
00:53:42,541 --> 00:53:44,250
Play a round with me.

838
00:53:44,333 --> 00:53:47,166
If you win
you can give the competition a miss.

839
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:48,458
If I win,

840
00:53:48,541 --> 00:53:50,666
you have to win
the World Mahjong Championship.

841
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:52,458
You can't force me like this.

842
00:53:52,541 --> 00:53:54,291
You're the one forcing me to do this.

843
00:53:54,375 --> 00:53:57,000
I could've become the Queen of Mahjong.

844
00:53:57,083 --> 00:53:59,708
I gave up everything to marry you,
the King of Mahjong.

845
00:53:59,791 --> 00:54:02,416
Now you're telling me to give up my dream.

846
00:54:05,458 --> 00:54:07,083
Let's play a round then.

847
00:54:14,708 --> 00:54:15,791
White Dragon.

848
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:18,750
Kong.

849
00:54:20,166 --> 00:54:21,291
Four Character.

850
00:54:24,416 --> 00:54:25,708
Red Dragon.

851
00:54:26,083 --> 00:54:27,083
Kong.

852
00:54:30,125 --> 00:54:31,291
Eight Circles.

853
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:37,458
Green Dragon.

854
00:54:37,541 --> 00:54:38,833
Kong.

855
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:43,583
Seven Bamboos.

856
00:54:44,833 --> 00:54:48,333
<i>I used to let her win all the time.</i>

857
00:54:48,416 --> 00:54:50,458
<i>But this time...</i>

858
00:55:12,541 --> 00:55:13,666
Ramona.

859
00:55:14,791 --> 00:55:16,458
Chicken Hand.

860
00:55:16,541 --> 00:55:19,833
I'm not that important to you after all.

861
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:29,375
<i>Little did she know</i>
<i>that I let her go on purpose.</i>

862
00:55:30,291 --> 00:55:33,375
<i>Although I didn't want to compete anymore.</i>

863
00:55:33,458 --> 00:55:37,958
<i>But she was still so young</i>
<i>She should pursue her dreams.</i>

864
00:55:38,041 --> 00:55:40,083
<i>I didn't want to hold her back.</i>

865
00:55:42,125 --> 00:55:46,375
Your wife was heartless
didn't it hurt you?

866
00:55:47,333 --> 00:55:50,583
That's how youngsters are,
they want glamour.

867
00:55:50,666 --> 00:55:53,416
Who doesn't want to be
the Queen of Mahjong?

868
00:55:54,291 --> 00:55:58,166
Do you still love your wife then?

869
00:55:59,541 --> 00:56:01,208
Of course.

870
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:04,500
Every second of my life.

871
00:56:15,041 --> 00:56:18,041
So handsome, let's put that on Facebook.

872
00:56:19,333 --> 00:56:20,916
Boss...

873
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,916
Handsome should be one word, not two.

874
00:56:25,666 --> 00:56:27,333
I did it on purpose.

875
00:56:27,416 --> 00:56:29,791
If not, you wouldn't have come in.

876
00:56:32,333 --> 00:56:33,791
Boss...

877
00:56:33,875 --> 00:56:35,541
People are slamming you on Facebook.

878
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:36,458
What are they saying?

879
00:56:36,541 --> 00:56:39,000
They say "handsome" should be one word.

880
00:56:39,083 --> 00:56:40,875
Take that picture down immediately.

881
00:56:40,958 --> 00:56:44,333
Then upload other stuff to distract them.

882
00:56:44,416 --> 00:56:47,000
Avoid bad publicity
before the World Mahjong Championships.

883
00:56:47,083 --> 00:56:48,416
Okay.

884
00:56:49,083 --> 00:56:50,833
How do I spell "surprise"?

885
00:56:50,916 --> 00:56:52,125
Just write it in Chinese.

886
00:56:52,541 --> 00:56:55,291
Good idea. Surprise.

887
00:56:56,375 --> 00:57:00,000
Boss, you're so wise, what's the surprise?

888
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:03,416
The first ever King of Mahjong versus
the winner of ten consecutive years.

889
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:05,041
Surprising enough?

890
00:57:05,875 --> 00:57:07,500
Oh Boss, so you're the first
ever King of Mahjong.

891
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:10,083
Only now do I know that Pak Chong Fatt
won it for ten consecutive years.

892
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:16,083
I've fed and clothed you two,
yet you don't even know who's who.

893
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:17,541
Look at those trophies behind.

894
00:57:17,625 --> 00:57:21,291
I use them to store my sauces,
can't you see?

895
00:57:26,208 --> 00:57:28,125
What plans do you have?

896
00:57:30,291 --> 00:57:33,291
Everything is going according to plan.

897
00:57:51,041 --> 00:57:54,166
I smell Yong tau foo,
this should be the house.

898
00:58:02,833 --> 00:58:06,041
I'll take it.
The Thirteen Wonders.

899
00:58:50,416 --> 00:58:51,458
Crazy.

900
00:58:51,541 --> 00:58:53,708
Can't you walk properly?

901
00:58:53,791 --> 00:58:56,750
Boss, you already came in this
with a bell in hand.

902
00:58:56,833 --> 00:58:59,250
Surely I have to pretend
to be possessed to complement you?

903
00:58:59,333 --> 00:59:00,666
Don't talk crap.

904
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:03,125
You've been here for so long
why haven't you reported to me?

905
00:59:03,208 --> 00:59:06,916
Have you found out what Kung fu
Pak Chong Fatt has been practicing?

906
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Yes, I found out that he
doesn't even touch mahjong.

907
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:18,125
That's great, I finally have reason
to sell you to Ethiopia.

908
00:59:18,208 --> 00:59:19,583
Just great.

909
00:59:19,666 --> 00:59:23,125
They suffer from famine and poverty
they won't be able to "use" me.

910
00:59:23,208 --> 00:59:26,000
They can't use you, but they can eat you.

911
00:59:26,583 --> 00:59:28,833
Your skin is slightly wrinkled
but your flesh is still quite tender.

912
00:59:28,916 --> 00:59:31,000
-Please, don't.
-Should be worth a dime or two.

913
00:59:32,333 --> 00:59:33,625
I did find out a secret of his.

914
00:59:33,708 --> 00:59:34,916
What secret? Out with it.

915
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,916
He practices a kind of Kung fu everyday.

916
00:59:38,208 --> 00:59:41,500
Palms joined with eyes focused.

917
00:59:41,583 --> 00:59:44,666
Tongue and limbs stretched out.

918
00:59:48,958 --> 00:59:51,833
Rein in the temples and diaphragm.

919
00:59:51,916 --> 00:59:54,500
Take in the energy of the universe
to nourish the brain.

920
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:58,750
So, this is Master's
Legendary Mahjong Kung fu.

921
00:59:59,375 --> 01:00:00,875
Who's peeping?

922
01:00:10,208 --> 01:00:12,083
I get it now.

923
01:00:13,916 --> 01:00:17,166
If Pak Chong Fatt can master it, so can I.

924
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:20,875
Let's see who's the real
King of Mahjong is.

925
01:00:21,125 --> 01:00:25,791
Your mission now is to persuade him
to take part in the championships.

926
01:00:25,875 --> 01:00:30,291
Only then will your mission be complete.

927
01:00:38,416 --> 01:00:42,708
<i>Let's see how you resist me.</i>

928
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:45,791
Hubby...

929
01:00:50,458 --> 01:00:52,291
Let's eat first.

930
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:56,250
Hubby.

931
01:00:57,083 --> 01:01:00,750
I have something...to tell you.

932
01:01:01,125 --> 01:01:03,750
What do you want?

933
01:01:03,833 --> 01:01:05,125
I want to say...

934
01:01:05,208 --> 01:01:07,125
We're back.

935
01:01:08,458 --> 01:01:10,583
Dad, mom.

936
01:01:15,083 --> 01:01:16,250
Fill the bowl.

937
01:01:18,583 --> 01:01:19,916
Have they gotten married?

938
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,208
Last I checked, they weren't married yet.

939
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:24,291
I really have something to tell you.

940
01:01:24,375 --> 01:01:27,500
So much food today?
Is there some offering to the gods?

941
01:01:27,583 --> 01:01:31,625
No, we haven't had a sumptuous meal
since your mum came back.

942
01:01:31,708 --> 01:01:33,166
Thanks to you, mom.

943
01:01:33,250 --> 01:01:34,541
Come, let's dig in.

944
01:01:34,625 --> 01:01:36,000
Mom Dad, let's dig in.

945
01:01:56,708 --> 01:01:58,833
What did you want to say just now?

946
01:01:58,916 --> 01:02:01,000
Nothing.

947
01:02:01,083 --> 01:02:04,583
I feel like we're a family.

948
01:02:04,666 --> 01:02:07,541
What's wrong with you?
We really are a family, okay.

949
01:02:07,875 --> 01:02:10,166
By the way, when did you
marry my daughter, may I ask?

950
01:02:10,250 --> 01:02:12,208
Last night.

951
01:02:12,291 --> 01:02:14,000
You married my daughter in my room?

952
01:02:41,541 --> 01:02:43,166
So handsome.

953
01:02:47,458 --> 01:02:48,666
Hubby...

954
01:02:49,416 --> 01:02:51,875
Am I interrupting your Kung fu practice?

955
01:02:54,666 --> 01:02:58,291
Are you sure this is related to...mahjong?

956
01:03:03,791 --> 01:03:04,958
Here it comes.

957
01:03:05,041 --> 01:03:06,708
I can feel it.

958
01:03:11,583 --> 01:03:15,791
Since you left, I...

959
01:03:17,333 --> 01:03:20,708
You haven't done "it" for 20 years?

960
01:03:21,583 --> 01:03:23,791
I've practiced the Legendary Mahjong
Kung fu for quite some time now.

961
01:03:23,875 --> 01:03:25,791
You guys are practicing
mahjong with me today.

962
01:03:25,875 --> 01:03:28,875
I was afraid, after not using it
for so long, it will...

963
01:03:28,958 --> 01:03:31,208
That's why I...

964
01:03:43,041 --> 01:03:44,916
Are you waiting for
the Six and Nine Character tiles?

965
01:03:48,083 --> 01:03:50,083
You need a single Three Character tile.

966
01:03:52,083 --> 01:03:54,208
You want the Six and Nine Circles tiles
right?

967
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:58,375
How do you know?

968
01:03:58,458 --> 01:04:01,333
You won't feel much in the beginning.

969
01:04:01,416 --> 01:04:04,333
But after 49 practice sessions,

970
01:04:04,416 --> 01:04:10,125
your carnal desire
will explode from within.

971
01:04:12,916 --> 01:04:14,291
What does it feel like?

972
01:04:14,375 --> 01:04:18,625
It feels like someone opened the zoo gates
and all the elephants are charging out.

973
01:04:36,875 --> 01:04:38,750
Boss, don't...

974
01:04:39,583 --> 01:04:41,583
Boss, I'm warning you
I'm very experienced.

975
01:04:42,666 --> 01:04:44,458
Once you start, I won't stop.

976
01:04:54,291 --> 01:04:55,666
What are you doing?

977
01:05:10,291 --> 01:05:12,416
-Hey.
-You old and cheap woman.

978
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:14,708
Why don't you dig a hole
and bury yourself in it?

979
01:05:14,791 --> 01:05:16,291
Don't let me see you again.

980
01:05:16,375 --> 01:05:17,916
Sorry, boss.

981
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,583
I was about to call you.

982
01:05:19,666 --> 01:05:22,875
The Kung fu that Ah Fatt
has been practicing isn't for mahjong.

983
01:05:22,958 --> 01:05:26,416
-It's for his little brother, right?
<i>-Yes.</i>

984
01:05:26,708 --> 01:05:28,833
You might as well tell me after my "little
brother" is injured from overexertion?

985
01:05:30,041 --> 01:05:33,166
<i>If you can't make Pak Chong Fatt</i>
<i>take part in the championships,</i>

986
01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:35,208
I'll sell you to Ethiopia.

987
01:05:35,291 --> 01:05:36,708
As for the gambling debts you owe me.

988
01:05:36,791 --> 01:05:40,666
<i>I'll cut your fingers off one by one.</i>

989
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:41,958
That's all.

990
01:05:45,583 --> 01:05:48,000
Wong Tin Ba, I shall remind you again.

991
01:05:48,083 --> 01:05:49,916
Don't say I'm long-winded.

992
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,541
Your 10-year good fortune
is coming to an end.

993
01:05:52,625 --> 01:05:54,750
If you want good fortune
for another ten years,

994
01:05:54,833 --> 01:05:59,041
you must defeat Pak Chong Fatt
at the championships this year.

995
01:05:59,958 --> 01:06:04,250
You're not just long-winded
you're ridiculously long-winded.

996
01:06:04,333 --> 01:06:05,750
Can you turn on the heater now?

997
01:06:15,791 --> 01:06:19,791
Don't tell me these vicious-looking people
are here for my Yong tau foo so early?

998
01:06:21,291 --> 01:06:24,125
-Hubby...
-Darling!

999
01:06:27,708 --> 01:06:29,500
It wasn't easy getting mum back,

1000
01:06:29,583 --> 01:06:31,583
and now she's taken away from us again.

1001
01:06:31,666 --> 01:06:34,458
I must look for my mum.

1002
01:06:34,541 --> 01:06:37,541
If it's a kidnap
why haven't we received any calls yet?

1003
01:06:44,458 --> 01:06:46,708
-Help.
-Ramona?

1004
01:06:47,875 --> 01:06:49,666
You recognize your wife's voice, right?

1005
01:06:50,041 --> 01:06:51,375
What do you want?

1006
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:56,333
Very simple, if I see you as one of the
players in the World Mahjong Championship,

1007
01:06:56,750 --> 01:06:58,083
you'll see her.

1008
01:06:58,166 --> 01:07:01,416
<i>If I don't see you then, you won't</i>
<i>see her for the rest of your life.</i>

1009
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:04,166
Help!

1010
01:07:07,916 --> 01:07:09,916
-So?
-Yeah, what now?

1011
01:07:12,791 --> 01:07:15,791
Brother Fatt is finally going back
to the mahjong table.

1012
01:07:15,875 --> 01:07:17,750
Let's welcome back Brother Fatt.

1013
01:07:19,583 --> 01:07:21,500
I'm very proud to be able to practice
and play with you.

1014
01:07:21,583 --> 01:07:23,833
I don't know
why I'm very anxious suddenly.

1015
01:07:23,916 --> 01:07:27,541
Why?
Fatt we're here to practice with you.

1016
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,875
According to the module I've designed,

1017
01:07:30,958 --> 01:07:32,833
the first session should be...

1018
01:07:33,333 --> 01:07:34,500
Drawing tiles.

1019
01:07:34,583 --> 01:07:36,041
<i>Everybody draw your own tiles please.</i>

1020
01:07:36,125 --> 01:07:38,250
<i>Draw the Thirteen Wonders</i>
<i>in the shortest time possible.</i>

1021
01:07:38,333 --> 01:07:40,333
<i>You can't look at the tiles while drawing.</i>

1022
01:08:03,291 --> 01:08:06,208
-Is this the correct way?
-You're good.

1023
01:08:06,291 --> 01:08:08,166
<i>Next, let's practice</i>
<i>how to tabulate points.</i>

1024
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:10,750
Tell me the points the moment
I reveal my hand.

1025
01:08:10,833 --> 01:08:13,458
These are the initial tiles of a dealer.

1026
01:08:13,541 --> 01:08:15,583
That's Four Small Blessings,
totals 13 points.

1027
01:08:15,666 --> 01:08:17,625
No, it's also a Mixed Pure Hand
you've got to add three points.

1028
01:08:17,708 --> 01:08:18,958
So the total should be 16 points.

1029
01:08:19,041 --> 01:08:20,458
-That's a lot of "fun".
-No.

1030
01:08:20,541 --> 01:08:21,958
If it's a dealers initial hand,
it's a Heavenly Hand.

1031
01:08:22,041 --> 01:08:24,708
A Heavenly, Mixed Pure Hand
with Four Small Blessings is 29 points.

1032
01:08:24,791 --> 01:08:26,750
What about this one?

1033
01:08:34,708 --> 01:08:36,625
Four Large Blessings 13 points,
Mixed Pure Hand 3 points.

1034
01:08:36,708 --> 01:08:40,541
Triplets Hand three points, including
the flowers is a total of 20 points.

1035
01:08:40,625 --> 01:08:43,125
Excellent.

1036
01:08:44,375 --> 01:08:45,833
How many points are in this one?

1037
01:08:46,833 --> 01:08:49,500
Hold on, give us some time.

1038
01:08:49,583 --> 01:08:53,708
This hand is neither here nor there.

1039
01:08:53,791 --> 01:08:55,916
Obviously it's a Chicken Hand.

1040
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,416
Genius.

1041
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:59,458
-You're a gambling genius.
-My idol.

1042
01:08:59,541 --> 01:09:02,291
Don't be so cliché
we're learning from one another.

1043
01:09:02,375 --> 01:09:05,041
I don't think you need to practice
the basics anymore.

1044
01:09:05,125 --> 01:09:06,916
Why don't we go straight into competition?

1045
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,375
Sure.

1046
01:09:11,166 --> 01:09:12,666
I'm so nervous.

1047
01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:14,250
Hold it.

1048
01:09:14,333 --> 01:09:17,125
I've never been this nervous playing
mahjong in the past decade.

1049
01:09:17,208 --> 01:09:20,250
I'm a little apprehensive
about playing against my master today.

1050
01:09:34,250 --> 01:09:38,333
-Dad...
-Brother Fatt...

1051
01:09:38,416 --> 01:09:39,458
What's the matter with you?

1052
01:09:45,041 --> 01:09:46,958
-Dad...
-How are you feeling?

1053
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,625
-Lie down.
-Thanks.

1054
01:09:52,208 --> 01:09:53,875
It's no big deal.

1055
01:09:53,958 --> 01:09:55,625
But I think I can't go to the competition.

1056
01:09:55,708 --> 01:09:57,166
Why?

1057
01:09:57,250 --> 01:10:00,125
You were killing it in the beginning.

1058
01:10:00,208 --> 01:10:02,125
What happened?

1059
01:10:02,375 --> 01:10:03,666
I wanted to win.

1060
01:10:03,750 --> 01:10:05,458
This is what happens
when you're too eager to win.

1061
01:10:05,541 --> 01:10:09,958
That's why I pulled out of the second
world championships.

1062
01:10:10,250 --> 01:10:12,208
I don't play to win.

1063
01:10:14,416 --> 01:10:18,166
With this mentality
how am I to defeat Wong Tin Ba?

1064
01:10:33,208 --> 01:10:34,750
Let's begin the day.

1065
01:10:41,625 --> 01:10:44,208
Where are you going so early?

1066
01:10:45,166 --> 01:10:46,583
Sassy.

1067
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:00,833
Ah Fatt.

1068
01:11:01,125 --> 01:11:03,250
Letter for you from Sassy.

1069
01:11:08,916 --> 01:11:11,083
{\an8}<i>I'm eloping with Wayne Yang.</i>

1070
01:11:11,166 --> 01:11:12,750
<i>Don't worry, it's just for a few days.</i>

1071
01:11:12,833 --> 01:11:14,500
<i>We'll be home once we've had enough fun.</i>

1072
01:11:14,583 --> 01:11:18,083
So this is Sassy's final move.

1073
01:11:18,166 --> 01:11:22,416
Ah Fatt, you've raised a daughter
with such fine character.

1074
01:12:06,791 --> 01:12:08,000
<i>Ah Fatt.</i>

1075
01:12:08,083 --> 01:12:11,083
<i>I knew you'd come back to find me.</i>

1076
01:12:11,166 --> 01:12:14,208
<i>I know you all too well.</i>

1077
01:12:14,291 --> 01:12:16,166
<i>Since the day I announced you</i>
<i>as the winner,</i>

1078
01:12:16,250 --> 01:12:18,375
<i>I knew he'd never let it go.</i>

1079
01:12:18,458 --> 01:12:21,625
<i>But I'm travelling the world now.</i>

1080
01:12:21,708 --> 01:12:25,125
<i>You need to settle your own problems.</i>

1081
01:12:25,416 --> 01:12:28,166
<i>A word of advice before I leave.</i>

1082
01:12:28,250 --> 01:12:30,583
<i>You don't have much weaknesses.</i>

1083
01:12:30,666 --> 01:12:32,666
<i>Except you think too much.</i>

1084
01:12:32,916 --> 01:12:34,541
<i>If you weren't like that,</i>

1085
01:12:34,625 --> 01:12:37,250
<i>Ramona probably wouldn't have left.</i>

1086
01:12:37,333 --> 01:12:40,666
<i>Your life would've been complete.</i>

1087
01:12:40,750 --> 01:12:42,125
<i>Do you remember?</i>

1088
01:12:42,208 --> 01:12:46,291
<i>I told you</i>
<i>the true spirit of playing mahjong.</i>

1089
01:12:48,416 --> 01:12:50,791
The tiles
don't determine winning or losing.

1090
01:12:50,875 --> 01:12:52,708
The player does.

1091
01:12:52,791 --> 01:12:55,291
The tiles are lifeless
but the player isn't.

1092
01:12:55,375 --> 01:12:58,250
Playing mahjong is like learning
how to be a good person.

1093
01:12:58,333 --> 01:13:02,875
If you get too caught up
in winning or losing,

1094
01:13:02,958 --> 01:13:04,708
even if you have the best hand
it'll all be in vain.

1095
01:13:04,791 --> 01:13:06,916
-One Circle.
-Game.

1096
01:13:07,166 --> 01:13:09,375
The Three Great Scholars
Triplets, Mixed Pure Hand.

1097
01:13:15,208 --> 01:13:16,125
Green Dragon.

1098
01:13:16,208 --> 01:13:17,708
-You're so smart.
-Game.

1099
01:13:17,791 --> 01:13:20,708
<i>You're not affected</i>
<i>by the outcome anymore.</i>

1100
01:13:20,791 --> 01:13:23,333
<i>How can you ever be defeated?</i>

1101
01:13:25,375 --> 01:13:30,708
It's only after 20 years that
I began to understand this saying.

1102
01:13:30,791 --> 01:13:33,333
Am I slow?

1103
01:13:33,416 --> 01:13:35,250
Luckily it's still in time.

1104
01:13:35,458 --> 01:13:38,875
TO MY DISCIPLE WONG TIN BA

1105
01:13:39,083 --> 01:13:41,375
TO MY DISCIPLE PAK CHONG FATT

1106
01:13:57,625 --> 01:13:59,833
THE 12TH KING OF MAHJONG
WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP

1107
01:14:07,208 --> 01:14:09,541
You really want to do this yourself?

1108
01:14:09,625 --> 01:14:13,708
I have my dad's genes
surely I won't come in last.

1109
01:14:13,791 --> 01:14:15,208
And the most important thing is

1110
01:14:15,291 --> 01:14:16,333
I can take the opportunity
to look for my mom.

1111
01:14:16,416 --> 01:14:17,416
Miss DeeYi Zhang.

1112
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:19,666
Welcome to
the King of Mahjong Championships.

1113
01:14:19,750 --> 01:14:21,666
-It's her?
-You know each other?

1114
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:23,250
I've seen her before.

1115
01:14:24,875 --> 01:14:28,708
We meet again, isn't that fate?

1116
01:14:28,791 --> 01:14:31,625
So that's your type.

1117
01:14:31,708 --> 01:14:34,208
What type? What do you mean by that?

1118
01:14:34,291 --> 01:14:36,375
Why would you know someone like that?

1119
01:14:37,541 --> 01:14:41,708
<i>That night in bed</i>
<i>you said you would love me forever.</i>

1120
01:14:44,333 --> 01:14:46,750
Since it's none of your business
are you still trying to be a hero?

1121
01:14:46,833 --> 01:14:49,458
I'll whoop your ass, Miss Third Party.

1122
01:14:49,541 --> 01:14:51,500
Miss, don't be too sad.

1123
01:14:51,583 --> 01:14:54,833
Sad? I'm more than thrilled
to see them fall apart.

1124
01:14:54,916 --> 01:14:57,458
That's how she ruined
a couple the other day.

1125
01:14:57,541 --> 01:14:59,541
Just because she couldn't stand them.

1126
01:15:05,916 --> 01:15:08,500
I'm the type that he likes,

1127
01:15:08,583 --> 01:15:11,625
and he's been devoted
to me all these years.

1128
01:15:11,708 --> 01:15:14,083
What? Are you jealous?

1129
01:15:14,166 --> 01:15:18,458
Why are you talking
to these people in public?

1130
01:15:18,541 --> 01:15:20,583
DeeYi Zhang.

1131
01:15:20,875 --> 01:15:22,833
Who are you? And who are they?

1132
01:15:22,916 --> 01:15:25,500
Aren't you afraid of
diminishing your own status?

1133
01:15:34,375 --> 01:15:37,791
Why? Where did your arrogance go?

1134
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,458
Initially there was just Wong Tin Ba.

1135
01:15:39,541 --> 01:15:42,250
Now there's another DeeYi Zhang,
how are we going to win?

1136
01:15:42,333 --> 01:15:43,750
Are you nuts?

1137
01:15:43,833 --> 01:15:46,500
Why are you putting your own team down?

1138
01:15:46,583 --> 01:15:47,958
Dad, what are you doing?

1139
01:15:48,041 --> 01:15:49,750
I want to come and play mahjong here.

1140
01:15:49,833 --> 01:15:52,416
Why are you dressed like that here?

1141
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:55,458
I'm a man, how can I let my daughter
battle this alone?

1142
01:15:55,541 --> 01:15:58,500
-Brother Fatt, you really are my idol.
-Of course.

1143
01:15:58,625 --> 01:16:01,083
-I thought you had no confidence?
-Initially I didn't.

1144
01:16:01,166 --> 01:16:04,750
Now I do, or how else do we save your mum?

1145
01:16:04,833 --> 01:16:06,333
Dad...

1146
01:16:06,416 --> 01:16:07,875
It's good that you're confident.

1147
01:16:07,958 --> 01:16:11,958
But, the way you're dressed...

1148
01:16:12,041 --> 01:16:14,208
-I think it looks good.
-No way.

1149
01:16:14,291 --> 01:16:17,666
The first ever King of Mahjong
must look the part.

1150
01:16:18,333 --> 01:16:20,166
We still have time.

1151
01:16:20,541 --> 01:16:22,416
-Let's go.
-Where to?

1152
01:16:23,625 --> 01:16:26,250
Not only do
I want to win this competition.

1153
01:16:26,333 --> 01:16:29,041
I want the two of you to make
the finals no matter what it takes.

1154
01:16:29,125 --> 01:16:31,875
I want Pak Chong Fatt
to be disgraced in the mahjong world.

1155
01:16:31,958 --> 01:16:33,958
I want him to hit rock bottom.

1156
01:16:35,291 --> 01:16:36,500
Yes.

1157
01:16:39,666 --> 01:16:41,208
Do you understand?

1158
01:16:42,583 --> 01:16:44,000
Yes.

1159
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,458
I've waited for this for 20 years.

1160
01:16:47,541 --> 01:16:49,541
I'll finally have my vengeance.

1161
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,000
THE 12TH KING OF MAHJONG
WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP

1162
01:17:08,333 --> 01:17:10,166
Hello, everyone.

1163
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:13,500
Welcome to the 12th King
of Mahjong World Championship.

1164
01:17:13,583 --> 01:17:17,458
-I'm your emcee, Mushroom.
-I'm Sea Cucumber.

1165
01:17:17,541 --> 01:17:20,041
Not only do we have the best
of the best players this year,

1166
01:17:20,125 --> 01:17:23,125
we also have a huge surprise
for everyone today.

1167
01:17:23,208 --> 01:17:28,583
We have invited
an incredibly unexpected special guest.

1168
01:17:28,666 --> 01:17:32,000
The first ever King of Mahjong,

1169
01:17:32,083 --> 01:17:34,666
Pak Chong Fatt.

1170
01:17:40,541 --> 01:17:42,875
Mr. Pak Chong Fatt
you're the first ever King of Mahjong.

1171
01:17:42,958 --> 01:17:44,916
Is Wong Tin Ba the reason
you came out of retirement?

1172
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,791
Is it because no one's been able
to defeat him in the past ten years?

1173
01:17:46,875 --> 01:17:47,958
And you think you can?

1174
01:17:48,041 --> 01:17:49,833
Are you confident of beating him?

1175
01:17:49,916 --> 01:17:52,125
To be honest, in terms of playing mahjong,

1176
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,375
can you not throw it anymore?

1177
01:17:55,458 --> 01:17:56,750
It looks cool, master.

1178
01:17:56,833 --> 01:17:58,791
I know, but it hurts.

1179
01:17:58,875 --> 01:17:59,750
Thank you.

1180
01:17:59,833 --> 01:18:02,875
Mahjong is a form of entertainment.

1181
01:18:02,958 --> 01:18:06,166
If you play to win, it loses its meaning.

1182
01:18:08,916 --> 01:18:12,750
Ah Fatt,
we're here to support you and Sassy.

1183
01:18:12,833 --> 01:18:14,958
-Give it your best shot.
-You can do it.

1184
01:18:15,041 --> 01:18:15,875
Thank you.

1185
01:18:16,166 --> 01:18:17,250
Where's Ah Lian?

1186
01:18:17,333 --> 01:18:20,208
She's busy doing plastic surgery.

1187
01:18:20,291 --> 01:18:23,458
Do you think I need
plastic surgery as well?

1188
01:18:23,666 --> 01:18:25,750
Absolutely.

1189
01:18:25,833 --> 01:18:27,791
Let's play mahjong first.

1190
01:18:28,041 --> 01:18:30,041
Will the inaugural King of Mahjong

1191
01:18:30,125 --> 01:18:32,541
pit against the King of Mahjong
of ten consecutive years?

1192
01:18:32,625 --> 01:18:33,916
Today's competition
is more exciting than ever before.

1193
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,791
Relax, just relax.

1194
01:18:36,875 --> 01:18:37,833
Okay.

1195
01:18:37,916 --> 01:18:39,666
This is so hot, what should I do?

1196
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,708
-Just a little while more.
-I can't take it anymore.

1197
01:18:45,666 --> 01:18:50,000
-Give it your best shot, Ah Fatt.
-We're right behind you.

1198
01:18:50,083 --> 01:18:51,625
Thanks.

1199
01:18:55,333 --> 01:18:58,458
I didn't want to wear this coat,
it was my daughter's idea.

1200
01:18:58,541 --> 01:19:00,708
-Understood.
-Good.

1201
01:19:07,208 --> 01:19:09,958
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

1202
01:19:10,041 --> 01:19:14,083
the champion for ten years in a row
Wong Tin Ba,

1203
01:19:14,166 --> 01:19:16,208
and his daughter, DeeYi Zhang.

1204
01:19:16,291 --> 01:19:19,708
As well as his disciple, Icy.

1205
01:19:21,583 --> 01:19:24,541
Mr. Wong Tin Ba
are you confident of keeping the title?

1206
01:19:24,625 --> 01:19:26,875
Are you confident of defeating
Pak Chong Fatt?

1207
01:19:26,958 --> 01:19:29,500
Don't go, we still have questions for you.

1208
01:19:32,125 --> 01:19:34,500
Do you think you look good
in that garbage bag?

1209
01:19:34,583 --> 01:19:35,708
Hello.

1210
01:19:46,291 --> 01:19:48,666
That's him, don't take him seriously.

1211
01:19:58,083 --> 01:19:59,250
As always,

1212
01:19:59,333 --> 01:20:02,375
in the preliminary round
the first contestants to score 20 points

1213
01:20:02,458 --> 01:20:05,333
will have their bulbs lit up,
each bulb represents two points.

1214
01:20:05,416 --> 01:20:07,000
They will then proceed to the next round.

1215
01:20:07,083 --> 01:20:09,000
This process shall be repeated
until we reach the semi-finals.

1216
01:20:09,083 --> 01:20:11,708
If no one manages
to get all their bulbs lit,

1217
01:20:11,791 --> 01:20:13,458
the highest scorer will proceed
to the next round.

1218
01:20:13,541 --> 01:20:16,708
Three winners from the semi-finals

1219
01:20:16,791 --> 01:20:19,458
will get to challenge our
10-year champion for the title.

1220
01:20:19,541 --> 01:20:24,000
Let's kick off this year's
King of Mahjong World Championship.

1221
01:20:28,125 --> 01:20:30,666
EAST

1222
01:20:38,875 --> 01:20:40,125
Heavenly Hand.

1223
01:20:40,208 --> 01:20:41,791
Are you kidding me?

1224
01:20:42,708 --> 01:20:45,708
First to qualify
for the semi-finals is Ms. Icy.

1225
01:20:49,916 --> 01:20:51,458
Game, Earthly Hand.

1226
01:20:52,291 --> 01:20:53,750
Second contestant
to advance to the semi-finals,

1227
01:20:53,833 --> 01:20:55,541
the daughter of Wong Tin Ba, DeeYi Zhang.

1228
01:20:55,625 --> 01:20:56,458
Congratulations.

1229
01:20:56,541 --> 01:20:59,666
Will the father and daughter
be challenging each other for the title?

1230
01:20:59,750 --> 01:21:02,041
Let's keep our eyes peeled.

1231
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:06,541
Four Large Blessings, concealed.

1232
01:21:06,625 --> 01:21:09,291
Mixed Pure Hand, All Terminal.
Three Hidden Treasure.

1233
01:21:11,333 --> 01:21:14,250
Pak Chong Fatt's daughter
also made it into the semi-finals.

1234
01:21:14,333 --> 01:21:17,083
-Congratulations, Ms. Sassy Bai.
-Sassy won.

1235
01:21:17,166 --> 01:21:19,250
Come have a seat, Sassy.

1236
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:21,833
You were great.

1237
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:24,500
WEST

1238
01:21:25,833 --> 01:21:27,875
NORTH

1239
01:21:32,875 --> 01:21:34,083
It's already the final round.

1240
01:21:34,166 --> 01:21:35,750
Do you think Brother Fatt
will get full lights?

1241
01:21:35,833 --> 01:21:37,250
That doesn't matter.

1242
01:21:37,333 --> 01:21:39,250
What's important is to win.

1243
01:21:48,958 --> 01:21:50,000
North Wind.

1244
01:21:56,541 --> 01:21:58,000
Pong.

1245
01:21:58,083 --> 01:22:00,625
<i>Discarding a character tile</i>
<i>to lure my North Wind.</i>

1246
01:22:00,708 --> 01:22:03,250
<i>Trying to draw a snake out of its hole.</i>

1247
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,458
<i>I can see through that.</i>

1248
01:22:09,375 --> 01:22:10,416
North Wind.

1249
01:22:12,791 --> 01:22:14,250
Win.

1250
01:22:14,666 --> 01:22:16,041
What a fine round.

1251
01:22:16,125 --> 01:22:18,375
What a move by Pak Chong Fatt.

1252
01:22:18,458 --> 01:22:20,625
Making the semi-finals
with the highest score.

1253
01:22:20,708 --> 01:22:22,083
He won by a hair's breadth.

1254
01:22:22,166 --> 01:22:23,833
Fatt, you were awesome.

1255
01:22:23,916 --> 01:22:25,416
You're so good.

1256
01:22:26,666 --> 01:22:29,208
It wasn't a landslide win
but you have such good skills.

1257
01:22:29,291 --> 01:22:32,166
And what a character, I am deeply humbled.

1258
01:22:32,250 --> 01:22:33,708
It's just a game.

1259
01:22:34,750 --> 01:22:36,958
It's just a game.

1260
01:22:37,583 --> 01:22:39,083
Pak Chong Fatt.

1261
01:22:39,166 --> 01:22:42,416
You purposely discarded a tile
for the player with the lowest score.

1262
01:22:42,666 --> 01:22:44,000
Good.

1263
01:22:45,375 --> 01:22:48,833
A hypocrite, but I like you.

1264
01:22:50,166 --> 01:22:52,250
THE 12TH KING OF MAHJONG
WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP

1265
01:23:07,416 --> 01:23:11,791
After the preliminary qualifying matches,
the semi-finals will now begin.

1266
01:23:19,333 --> 01:23:21,000
-East Wind.
-I'll take that.

1267
01:23:24,041 --> 01:23:25,583
-Chicken Hand.
-That's right.

1268
01:23:27,875 --> 01:23:29,208
Five Bamboos.

1269
01:23:29,291 --> 01:23:31,916
Take the in-betweens.

1270
01:23:32,791 --> 01:23:35,250
Chicken Hand again.

1271
01:23:37,250 --> 01:23:39,083
-East Wind.
-I'll take that.

1272
01:23:39,166 --> 01:23:41,541
East Wind two points.

1273
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:44,333
Can he win like that?

1274
01:23:44,416 --> 01:23:46,166
It's a race between
the hare and the turtle.

1275
01:23:46,250 --> 01:23:49,125
This move is called
"stuffing yourself up".

1276
01:23:49,208 --> 01:23:52,458
A few small wins make for a big win,
you didn't get it.

1277
01:23:54,791 --> 01:23:56,541
-One Bamboo.
-I'll take that.

1278
01:23:56,625 --> 01:23:57,750
Chicken Hand.

1279
01:24:01,041 --> 01:24:04,958
Mahjong, Self-Draw, three points, sorry.

1280
01:24:05,041 --> 01:24:06,875
As expected.

1281
01:24:06,958 --> 01:24:10,791
See, I was right, the turtle won.

1282
01:24:10,875 --> 01:24:13,916
Mr. Pak Chong Fatt is the first
to make it to the final. Congratulations!

1283
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:18,541
Next, we shall witness
the battle of the century.

1284
01:24:24,541 --> 01:24:25,708
You can do it.

1285
01:24:43,833 --> 01:24:44,916
Look.

1286
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:48,541
She's got so many flower tiles.

1287
01:24:48,625 --> 01:24:52,000
If she wins this round
it's a lot of points.

1288
01:24:52,083 --> 01:24:53,541
If she makes it into the finals,

1289
01:24:53,625 --> 01:24:56,833
she will be playing
against Brother Fatt for Wong Tin Ba.

1290
01:24:59,166 --> 01:25:06,041
I'll jinx that...jinx...

1291
01:25:06,125 --> 01:25:09,000
Self-Draw win, Pure Honor Hand.
Three Great Scholars.

1292
01:25:09,083 --> 01:25:11,250
We jinxed the wrong one.

1293
01:25:11,333 --> 01:25:12,500
How many points is that?

1294
01:25:12,583 --> 01:25:14,916
A lot, for sure.

1295
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:19,166
Our second finalist is Ms. Icy.
Congratulations.

1296
01:25:21,916 --> 01:25:24,916
Who will be
the final player in the finals?

1297
01:25:26,541 --> 01:25:28,250
So nerve-wracking.

1298
01:25:30,333 --> 01:25:33,041
But if you look at Sassy Bai's
and DeeYi Zhang's table,

1299
01:25:33,125 --> 01:25:36,583
this is an inverse duel
between their fathers.

1300
01:25:39,833 --> 01:25:40,958
Brother Fatt.

1301
01:25:41,666 --> 01:25:42,958
Fatt...

1302
01:25:53,250 --> 01:25:54,458
Go.

1303
01:25:57,541 --> 01:25:59,166
Oh, what a klutz, DeeYi Zhang.

1304
01:25:59,250 --> 01:26:02,000
She accidentally revealed a tile
and is now at a disadvantage.

1305
01:26:02,083 --> 01:26:03,750
Luckily it's just a Formed Meld.

1306
01:26:03,833 --> 01:26:05,291
Two Circles, Open Kong.

1307
01:26:06,333 --> 01:26:08,708
Robbing the Kong, win.

1308
01:26:11,833 --> 01:26:13,625
That's a Trick Hand.

1309
01:26:13,750 --> 01:26:15,166
You were waiting for the Two Circles,
Five Circles and Eight Circles tiles.

1310
01:26:15,250 --> 01:26:17,250
You passed up that Eight Circles just now
and you didn't draw.

1311
01:26:17,333 --> 01:26:18,583
How can you take the Two Circles now?

1312
01:26:18,666 --> 01:26:22,625
Right, according to the rules
she can't take this tile.

1313
01:26:22,708 --> 01:26:26,166
But she's already revealed her hand
so it's considered a Trick Hand.

1314
01:26:26,250 --> 01:26:27,875
-That's right.
-We are at the last round,

1315
01:26:27,958 --> 01:26:30,166
and it's a tie between
DeeYi Zhang and Sassy Bai.

1316
01:26:30,250 --> 01:26:34,875
DeeYi's Trick Hand causes
her loss to Sassy by a hair's breadth.

1317
01:26:37,583 --> 01:26:38,916
Sassy.

1318
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,708
That's right, she won, that's my daughter.

1319
01:26:52,958 --> 01:26:55,333
Don't you remember what I've taught you?

1320
01:26:56,750 --> 01:26:58,708
Do you have polio?

1321
01:26:58,791 --> 01:27:01,625
You can't even hold on
to an Eight Circles tile.

1322
01:27:01,708 --> 01:27:05,000
This is a mistake only an idiot will make.

1323
01:27:05,375 --> 01:27:08,458
It's my mistake, but I didn't mean it.

1324
01:27:08,708 --> 01:27:10,583
It's not whether you meant it or not.

1325
01:27:10,666 --> 01:27:12,916
It's about how I'm going to
face the public from now on.

1326
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,666
You're my daughter, DeeYi Zhang.

1327
01:27:15,750 --> 01:27:17,875
I don't want you to be
number one in anything else.

1328
01:27:17,958 --> 01:27:21,458
I only want you to be
number one in mahjong.

1329
01:27:21,541 --> 01:27:24,291
Since I'm such
an embarrassment to you, I'll leave.

1330
01:27:24,583 --> 01:27:26,083
You're leaving...

1331
01:27:26,166 --> 01:27:29,416
Who's gonna take photo
with me later when I win?

1332
01:27:29,875 --> 01:27:33,166
You'd ruin my perfect father image.

1333
01:27:35,541 --> 01:27:37,125
If she really leaves,

1334
01:27:37,208 --> 01:27:40,375
cancel all her credit cards for me.

1335
01:27:44,083 --> 01:27:47,000
The most exciting match
and the best of the best

1336
01:27:47,083 --> 01:27:49,458
is unfolding right before us.

1337
01:27:49,541 --> 01:27:54,416
The finals of this year's
King of Mahjong Championship starts now.

1338
01:28:02,291 --> 01:28:03,708
What's the matter?

1339
01:28:03,791 --> 01:28:06,333
-Are you nervous?
-A little.

1340
01:28:06,416 --> 01:28:08,916
Are you worried
that you won't draw a good hand?

1341
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,291
Sometimes I can't get good ingredients
from the market,

1342
01:28:11,375 --> 01:28:12,833
but I still have to cook.

1343
01:28:12,916 --> 01:28:14,916
You can do it if you put
your heart into it.

1344
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,791
Chicken Hand is also considered a win.

1345
01:28:16,875 --> 01:28:19,375
Don't be afraid of losing, just do it.

1346
01:28:26,875 --> 01:28:27,958
Brother...

1347
01:28:29,125 --> 01:28:31,125
Don't call me that.

1348
01:28:31,416 --> 01:28:34,875
From now on, you'll have to call me the
King of Mahjong for 11 consecutive years.

1349
01:28:35,416 --> 01:28:38,416
Did you eat a lot of garlic?
Your mouth stinks.

1350
01:28:38,500 --> 01:28:39,916
He does have a better chance.

1351
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,791
Cut the crap.

1352
01:28:41,875 --> 01:28:44,666
-I'll finish you off in one round.
-Of course.

1353
01:28:59,375 --> 01:29:02,791
Let's see what you guys have in hand.

1354
01:29:02,875 --> 01:29:04,083
Red Dragon.

1355
01:29:04,166 --> 01:29:05,500
Pong.

1356
01:29:12,750 --> 01:29:14,416
<i>Let's move in for the kill then.</i>

1357
01:29:14,500 --> 01:29:15,833
<i>Red Dragon.</i>

1358
01:29:22,166 --> 01:29:24,500
-Green Dragon.
-Pong.

1359
01:29:33,291 --> 01:29:35,833
I'll just follow your lead, Green Dragon.

1360
01:29:35,916 --> 01:29:37,083
Why did you do that?

1361
01:29:37,166 --> 01:29:40,000
I told you before, learn how to be
a good person before learning mahjong.

1362
01:29:40,083 --> 01:29:44,000
People might think
you're talking about them.

1363
01:29:44,083 --> 01:29:47,458
This is your elder, show some respect.

1364
01:29:47,541 --> 01:29:49,666
That's right
you need to respect your elders.

1365
01:29:49,750 --> 01:29:51,500
Stop chiding your daughter.

1366
01:29:51,583 --> 01:29:53,416
She's just following
the bad example you set.

1367
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:56,291
It's genes.

1368
01:29:57,750 --> 01:29:59,958
You already have both
Green and Red Dragons.

1369
01:30:00,041 --> 01:30:01,541
Are you going to get the White Dragon too?

1370
01:30:01,625 --> 01:30:03,750
That would be such a coincidence.

1371
01:30:03,833 --> 01:30:04,708
Pong.

1372
01:30:05,583 --> 01:30:07,541
Why are you so careless?

1373
01:30:07,625 --> 01:30:09,791
That's a Three Great Scholars
you just gave away.

1374
01:30:09,875 --> 01:30:10,875
And you asked me to show him respect?

1375
01:30:10,958 --> 01:30:13,083
How would I know he has all three dragons?

1376
01:30:13,166 --> 01:30:15,333
And you know how much I hate those tiles.

1377
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:18,583
Nine Bamboos.

1378
01:30:22,083 --> 01:30:23,291
Nine Bamboos.

1379
01:30:24,958 --> 01:30:26,666
Nothing from you?

1380
01:30:26,750 --> 01:30:27,916
Watch me.

1381
01:30:30,166 --> 01:30:31,125
East Wind.

1382
01:30:31,208 --> 01:30:32,291
Pong. East Wind.

1383
01:30:33,208 --> 01:30:35,791
<i>I have to be smart about this.</i>

1384
01:30:35,875 --> 01:30:37,166
<i>I have to let dad Pong.</i>

1385
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:39,416
-One Circle.
-Pong.

1386
01:30:42,916 --> 01:30:43,750
South Wind.

1387
01:30:43,833 --> 01:30:45,125
Pong. South Wind.

1388
01:30:46,625 --> 01:30:48,708
-Two Circles.
-Pong.

1389
01:30:50,375 --> 01:30:51,666
West Wind.

1390
01:30:51,750 --> 01:30:53,166
Pong. West Wind.

1391
01:30:54,625 --> 01:30:57,750
You'll have to cover all losses if you
were to gift her a Four Large Blessings.

1392
01:30:57,833 --> 01:30:58,750
Three Circles.

1393
01:30:58,833 --> 01:31:01,708
Even the blind could tell you
can't discard a North Wind tile now.

1394
01:31:04,208 --> 01:31:06,083
Icy, prepare to Pong.

1395
01:31:06,166 --> 01:31:07,791
How would you know?

1396
01:31:07,875 --> 01:31:10,333
I'm the King of Mahjong.

1397
01:31:10,416 --> 01:31:11,958
I'll shout it out for you.

1398
01:31:12,041 --> 01:31:13,708
Pong. Two Character.

1399
01:31:18,083 --> 01:31:20,250
She only needs another tile to win.

1400
01:31:21,875 --> 01:31:23,750
I can't discard the North Wind.

1401
01:31:25,666 --> 01:31:28,041
-Three Bamboos.
-I'll take that.

1402
01:31:28,916 --> 01:31:31,250
How? It should be hers, not yours.

1403
01:31:31,333 --> 01:31:32,916
Don't you know the rules?

1404
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Take it, even though it's nothing much.

1405
01:31:36,333 --> 01:31:37,833
Four Small Blessings.

1406
01:31:39,333 --> 01:31:40,166
Sassy.

1407
01:31:40,250 --> 01:31:42,666
She is Winning with
a Four Small Blessings hand.

1408
01:31:42,750 --> 01:31:44,500
She's devouring "herself".

1409
01:31:45,791 --> 01:31:47,000
Are you playing or is she playing?

1410
01:31:47,083 --> 01:31:49,541
If you're playing for real
she should be on her own.

1411
01:31:49,625 --> 01:31:52,000
If you were to team up and bully her.

1412
01:31:52,083 --> 01:31:53,541
Why don't you two share a hand?

1413
01:31:54,708 --> 01:31:57,375
Boss can't defeat them with a single blow.

1414
01:31:57,458 --> 01:32:00,000
That's a first in ten years.

1415
01:32:00,083 --> 01:32:03,125
Pak Chong Fatt is really something.

1416
01:32:03,208 --> 01:32:04,666
What the...

1417
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:10,916
I'm letting you win this round
since you're not so bright.

1418
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,083
Let's break for 15 minutes
and resume later.

1419
01:32:13,166 --> 01:32:15,375
Don't take it to heart, that's how he is.

1420
01:32:18,250 --> 01:32:20,958
There will be a 15-minute interval,
see you later.

1421
01:32:21,041 --> 01:32:22,791
See you later.

1422
01:32:25,041 --> 01:32:26,958
I realized
that you're rather fidgety today.

1423
01:32:27,041 --> 01:32:29,666
You'll raise your chest
when you hold big tiles, that's not good.

1424
01:32:29,750 --> 01:32:31,625
Be more mindful of it.

1425
01:32:31,708 --> 01:32:33,041
Daughter of Wong Tin Ba.

1426
01:32:33,125 --> 01:32:35,541
Come with me,
I have something to show you.

1427
01:32:37,625 --> 01:32:39,041
Your father said okay.

1428
01:32:39,875 --> 01:32:41,833
What kind of wife did he marry,

1429
01:32:41,916 --> 01:32:44,166
for him to have such
a tanned and skinny daughter?

1430
01:32:45,041 --> 01:32:46,666
Pak Chong Fatt is here
for the championship.

1431
01:32:46,750 --> 01:32:48,500
I have completed my mission,
where's my money?

1432
01:32:50,375 --> 01:32:52,250
I want it now.

1433
01:32:54,125 --> 01:32:55,875
So little?

1434
01:32:56,208 --> 01:32:57,416
I've settled your gambling debts.

1435
01:32:57,500 --> 01:33:00,166
Food and accommodation
at my house cost money too.

1436
01:33:00,583 --> 01:33:02,250
-What a cheapskate.
-Beat it.

1437
01:33:04,625 --> 01:33:06,750
You couldn't discard the North Wind tile,
that's right.

1438
01:33:06,833 --> 01:33:09,833
You couldn't discard
any Bamboo tiles as well, yet you did.

1439
01:33:12,750 --> 01:33:14,833
So everything was a lie.

1440
01:33:16,208 --> 01:33:18,250
It's not too late to realize that.

1441
01:33:19,583 --> 01:33:22,833
You came back to find us
because he paid you to do it.

1442
01:33:22,916 --> 01:33:23,916
That's right.

1443
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:27,291
I've succeeded in getting him back
into compete after all these years.

1444
01:33:27,375 --> 01:33:28,833
Of course, I'm happy.

1445
01:33:28,916 --> 01:33:30,458
Are you?

1446
01:33:30,541 --> 01:33:33,250
Of course,
who wouldn't be with all this money?

1447
01:33:41,916 --> 01:33:44,750
What's the matter? Are you questioning me?

1448
01:33:44,833 --> 01:33:46,250
Dad,

1449
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:50,791
Mom's leaving, won't you make her stay?

1450
01:33:50,875 --> 01:33:53,583
Can I?

1451
01:33:53,875 --> 01:33:57,291
Remember to take care of yourself.

1452
01:33:57,375 --> 01:34:00,583
Don't open your eyes
so big when you're lying.

1453
01:34:00,666 --> 01:34:04,375
Don't act cool when you're cheating
that will give you away.

1454
01:34:07,041 --> 01:34:08,708
Aren't you mad at me?

1455
01:34:08,791 --> 01:34:11,375
Really?

1456
01:34:11,458 --> 01:34:13,666
I just want you to be happy.

1457
01:34:13,750 --> 01:34:16,541
You knew she was lying all along?

1458
01:34:19,750 --> 01:34:22,375
Why didn't you say anything?

1459
01:34:25,541 --> 01:34:27,958
Because you would leave again if I did.

1460
01:34:34,041 --> 01:34:35,500
Wait.

1461
01:34:48,416 --> 01:34:49,375
All right, that's enough.

1462
01:34:49,458 --> 01:34:52,833
Look, Brother Fatt is not only
God of Mahjong, he's also a Casanova.

1463
01:34:52,916 --> 01:34:53,750
We're not young anymore.

1464
01:34:53,833 --> 01:34:56,125
We're here for the competition
cut the drama, will you?

1465
01:34:56,208 --> 01:34:58,708
Mind your own business.

1466
01:34:59,791 --> 01:35:01,916
Come on, we're not young anymore.

1467
01:35:03,125 --> 01:35:04,583
My beloved daughter,

1468
01:35:05,666 --> 01:35:08,291
I have wronged you.

1469
01:35:08,375 --> 01:35:10,916
The first time I lay my eyes on you,

1470
01:35:14,458 --> 01:35:19,416
I knew you were the best thing
to have ever happened to me.

1471
01:35:19,500 --> 01:35:22,541
Can you forgive me?

1472
01:35:28,875 --> 01:35:31,791
-Can we go on with the game now?
-Let's go.

1473
01:35:34,375 --> 01:35:37,708
People think they need to be number one,

1474
01:35:37,791 --> 01:35:41,166
what they really need is to be loved.

1475
01:35:44,208 --> 01:35:46,250
Why isn't my father like that?

1476
01:35:51,708 --> 01:35:54,333
Sorry, excuse me.

1477
01:35:54,875 --> 01:35:56,833
-We're here.
-Fatt.

1478
01:35:56,916 --> 01:35:57,875
-You're enjoying this, aren't you?
-Isn't that a good thing?

1479
01:35:57,958 --> 01:36:00,875
-Dad, mom, people are watching.
-I can't bear to be apart from you.

1480
01:36:00,958 --> 01:36:03,458
Dad, mom, let's play mahjong.

1481
01:36:03,541 --> 01:36:04,958
-Yes.
-We have to be apart again.

1482
01:36:05,041 --> 01:36:07,291
-I'll make this quick.
-I can't bear for us to be apart, hurry.

1483
01:36:07,375 --> 01:36:09,666
Be good.

1484
01:36:12,041 --> 01:36:13,416
Take care of him.

1485
01:36:14,208 --> 01:36:16,125
So handsome.

1486
01:36:17,291 --> 01:36:20,625
Pak Chong Fatt, are you a man?

1487
01:36:20,708 --> 01:36:22,666
You're okay with your wife
treating you this way?

1488
01:36:22,750 --> 01:36:26,083
What do you know about love?

1489
01:36:26,833 --> 01:36:28,875
Is there something wrong with your father?

1490
01:36:28,958 --> 01:36:30,833
Let's play.

1491
01:36:30,916 --> 01:36:33,166
And look at your wife.

1492
01:36:33,250 --> 01:36:35,583
She just took my money,

1493
01:36:35,666 --> 01:36:38,125
and now she's on your side
cheering you on.

1494
01:36:38,208 --> 01:36:39,750
So unprofessional.

1495
01:36:39,833 --> 01:36:41,875
No wonder you're married to each other.

1496
01:36:45,541 --> 01:36:46,958
Shuffle the tiles.

1497
01:36:52,750 --> 01:36:53,875
Seven Character.

1498
01:36:54,208 --> 01:36:55,416
Five Circles.

1499
01:36:55,500 --> 01:36:57,208
-In-between.
-Pong.

1500
01:37:02,916 --> 01:37:04,375
Three Bamboos.

1501
01:37:04,458 --> 01:37:05,833
I'll take that.

1502
01:37:08,541 --> 01:37:09,375
Eight Circles.

1503
01:37:09,458 --> 01:37:10,958
-In-between.
-I'll take that.

1504
01:37:11,041 --> 01:37:14,750
Flowerless, Concealed, Sequence Hand win
with a single Eight Circles, three points.

1505
01:37:17,166 --> 01:37:18,375
This is mere luck.

1506
01:37:18,458 --> 01:37:20,833
You won't be lucky everyday.

1507
01:37:21,125 --> 01:37:22,291
Whatever.

1508
01:37:34,166 --> 01:37:35,833
-Nine Character.
-Pong.

1509
01:37:37,208 --> 01:37:38,750
Six Character.

1510
01:37:40,375 --> 01:37:42,541
-Two Circles.
-I'll take that.

1511
01:37:48,208 --> 01:37:50,000
-Three Bamboos.
-Pong.

1512
01:37:55,958 --> 01:37:58,000
-One Bamboo.
-Something to take again.

1513
01:38:03,125 --> 01:38:04,625
Are you nuts?

1514
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,208
All these years you've been
the King of Mahjong,

1515
01:38:08,291 --> 01:38:11,375
your daughter has been unhappy.

1516
01:38:11,458 --> 01:38:12,833
Are you happy?

1517
01:38:13,875 --> 01:38:17,583
One has polio, one is pea-brained.

1518
01:38:17,666 --> 01:38:19,166
Just play.

1519
01:38:24,208 --> 01:38:26,208
-Eight Character.
-Pong.

1520
01:38:28,791 --> 01:38:30,208
I win.

1521
01:38:35,416 --> 01:38:37,375
I am destined to win today,

1522
01:38:37,458 --> 01:38:40,000
no matter whose side you're on.

1523
01:38:51,375 --> 01:38:53,583
Do you remember when we were young?

1524
01:38:53,666 --> 01:38:56,916
Master told us a story
about the wind and the sun?

1525
01:38:58,416 --> 01:38:59,625
He's been such a dumbass
since we were young.

1526
01:38:59,708 --> 01:39:00,833
Six Bamboos.

1527
01:39:11,625 --> 01:39:12,708
Eight Bamboos.

1528
01:39:15,083 --> 01:39:16,541
Five Circles.

1529
01:39:18,541 --> 01:39:19,750
Three Character.

1530
01:39:19,833 --> 01:39:23,041
<i>Dad, he has all the suits.</i>

1531
01:39:23,125 --> 01:39:25,291
<i>I'm sure he's building</i>
<i>The Thirteen Wonders.</i>

1532
01:39:25,375 --> 01:39:28,833
<i>It won't be that easy.</i>

1533
01:39:33,708 --> 01:39:36,458
<i>Why would Wong Tin Ba build</i>
<i>The Thirteen Wonders?</i>

1534
01:39:36,541 --> 01:39:39,500
<i>The focus should be</i>
<i>on the Green Dragon now.</i>

1535
01:39:41,083 --> 01:39:42,083
Seven Bamboos.

1536
01:39:46,583 --> 01:39:47,833
Two Character.

1537
01:39:51,583 --> 01:39:55,208
Everything is going so well.

1538
01:40:55,666 --> 01:40:57,625
Pong.

1539
01:40:58,083 --> 01:41:00,291
Don't rush it.

1540
01:41:00,375 --> 01:41:03,458
Everyone can tell
I'm waiting for the Green Dragon tile.

1541
01:41:03,541 --> 01:41:06,541
Yet you discarded it?
Are you out of your mind?

1542
01:41:06,625 --> 01:41:09,125
Because all you care about
is winning or losing.

1543
01:41:16,875 --> 01:41:17,958
Green Dragon.

1544
01:41:18,041 --> 01:41:19,875
I should thank you.

1545
01:41:19,958 --> 01:41:23,208
Because of your ploy, I found my wife.

1546
01:41:23,291 --> 01:41:25,791
And my daughter reunited with her mum.

1547
01:41:25,875 --> 01:41:27,625
Brother...

1548
01:41:27,708 --> 01:41:31,583
This Green Dragon is just a mahjong tile.

1549
01:41:31,666 --> 01:41:33,708
I'll give it to you if you like.

1550
01:41:35,791 --> 01:41:39,000
<i>So we are really poles apart.</i>

1551
01:41:40,375 --> 01:41:44,083
<i>It feels as though Pak Chong Fatt</i>
<i>is not a mere human being.</i>

1552
01:41:44,625 --> 01:41:45,958
<i>He's like...</i>

1553
01:41:46,041 --> 01:41:48,500
<i>He is...</i>

1554
01:41:48,583 --> 01:41:50,916
<i>Right, that's him.</i>

1555
01:41:51,208 --> 01:41:54,583
Wukong, you want the Green Dragon tile?

1556
01:41:55,125 --> 01:41:57,291
I have it.

1557
01:41:57,416 --> 01:42:00,666
It always gets in my way
shall I give it to you?

1558
01:42:07,791 --> 01:42:08,833
Wukong...

1559
01:42:08,916 --> 01:42:14,208
You're good at playing mahjong,
but you have no integrity.

1560
01:42:16,166 --> 01:42:17,875
You've won.

1561
01:42:17,958 --> 01:42:19,541
Why don't you play?

1562
01:42:24,291 --> 01:42:25,583
Green Dragon.

1563
01:42:26,958 --> 01:42:28,125
Game.

1564
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:31,458
The Thirteen Wonders.

1565
01:42:32,166 --> 01:42:34,083
Do you think we had more fun playing
mahjong when we were kids?

1566
01:42:34,166 --> 01:42:36,166
Or now?

1567
01:42:36,250 --> 01:42:37,750
Playing mahjong.

1568
01:42:37,833 --> 01:42:40,750
To me, playing mahjong
is about having a good time.

1569
01:42:40,833 --> 01:42:42,208
Winning or losing is not important.

1570
01:42:42,291 --> 01:42:45,166
I understand now, master.

1571
01:42:45,250 --> 01:42:46,708
Understood.

1572
01:42:51,250 --> 01:42:53,250
I'm hungry, let's go.

1573
01:42:53,333 --> 01:42:56,000
-I want a roasted chicken drumstick.
-Sure.

1574
01:42:57,791 --> 01:43:00,875
The winner of the 12th World
King of Mahjong Championship is...

1575
01:43:00,958 --> 01:43:04,916
None other than our boss, Wong Tin Ba.

1576
01:43:15,333 --> 01:43:17,250
Who else could it be, other than our boss?

1577
01:43:17,333 --> 01:43:19,708
Come, say it with me.

1578
01:43:19,791 --> 01:43:22,041
Wong Tin Ba!

1579
01:43:22,125 --> 01:43:23,541
Cut the crap, let's go eat.

1580
01:43:23,625 --> 01:43:25,666
Yeah, let's go.

1581
01:43:29,708 --> 01:43:31,041
Hubby...

1582
01:43:31,125 --> 01:43:32,625
What do you want now?

1583
01:43:32,708 --> 01:43:35,833
I feel very guilty, are you mad at me?

1584
01:43:36,125 --> 01:43:37,250
Let's not talk about this anymore.

1585
01:43:37,333 --> 01:43:39,291
The most important thing is
for our family to stay together.

1586
01:43:39,375 --> 01:43:42,708
That's right, you're the best.

1587
01:43:42,791 --> 01:43:44,125
Pak Chong Fatt.

1588
01:43:44,208 --> 01:43:45,250
What do you want?

1589
01:43:45,333 --> 01:43:46,875
I want to have a word with your father.

1590
01:43:46,958 --> 01:43:49,791
If they don't sound right to you,
give me two slaps.

1591
01:43:51,416 --> 01:43:53,000
What do you want?

1592
01:43:53,833 --> 01:43:57,916
I have been very worried that I won't
win again after my luck runs out.

1593
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,125
But I understand today,

1594
01:44:00,208 --> 01:44:02,333
that as long as I have you as a brother,

1595
01:44:02,416 --> 01:44:04,750
it's hard for me to lose.

1596
01:44:07,625 --> 01:44:11,166
I'm not the only one you have around you.

1597
01:44:12,041 --> 01:44:14,041
All right, bye.

1598
01:44:16,791 --> 01:44:18,791
Hey...

1599
01:44:21,541 --> 01:44:24,000
Are you two going to leave just like that?

1600
01:44:26,541 --> 01:44:29,333
I know I was wrong
to curse you with polio.

1601
01:44:29,416 --> 01:44:32,791
But you're my daughter and I'm your dad,
we're family.

1602
01:44:32,875 --> 01:44:34,416
Let's make up, shall we?

1603
01:44:36,750 --> 01:44:39,000
I can even give up my title
of King of Mahjong.

1604
01:44:39,416 --> 01:44:41,291
Sorry.

1605
01:44:42,833 --> 01:44:45,416
I'm sorry.

1606
01:44:50,416 --> 01:44:53,583
You can be so gentlemanly, Dad.

1607
01:44:56,166 --> 01:44:58,416
How can you leave just like that?

1608
01:44:58,500 --> 01:45:00,666
Don't forget
you've killed Little Mosquito.

1609
01:45:00,750 --> 01:45:01,958
I would be left alone if you leave.

1610
01:45:02,041 --> 01:45:04,166
Our house will become so cold.

1611
01:45:04,250 --> 01:45:06,291
You want me to freeze to death?

1612
01:45:06,375 --> 01:45:08,250
Stay so you can continue to help me.

1613
01:45:08,583 --> 01:45:09,666
Okay?

1614
01:45:11,041 --> 01:45:12,541
Thank you, boss.

1615
01:45:25,791 --> 01:45:28,625
-Green Dragon, hurry up.
-Sassy.

1616
01:45:28,708 --> 01:45:30,000
Nine Circles.

1617
01:45:34,333 --> 01:45:36,666
-Be careful.
-Hurry up.

1618
01:45:36,750 --> 01:45:38,458
-Two Circles.
-Pong.

1619
01:45:38,541 --> 01:45:40,125
You're so stupid.

1620
01:45:40,875 --> 01:45:43,416
There's no fool in mahjong
what matters most is to be happy, right?

1621
01:45:43,500 --> 01:45:45,208
Don't scold him.

1622
01:45:45,583 --> 01:45:48,708
Why do the kitchens of these
rich people feel so hot?

1623
01:45:49,583 --> 01:45:51,750
Oh, that's because
you are clinging onto me.

1624
01:45:51,833 --> 01:45:52,833
Food must be served on time during CNY.

1625
01:45:52,916 --> 01:45:54,500
Didn't you say you like it
when I pretend to be a koala bear?

1626
01:45:54,583 --> 01:45:55,791
Brother...

1627
01:45:55,875 --> 01:45:57,791
This is the kitchen, not the bedroom.

1628
01:45:57,875 --> 01:45:59,666
I asked you to cook rice not fry rice.

1629
01:45:59,750 --> 01:46:02,625
It's been 20 over years
I can't help myself.

1630
01:46:02,708 --> 01:46:03,583
Speaking of which,

1631
01:46:03,666 --> 01:46:07,750
the Legendary Kung fu that Master
taught you, what was it for?

1632
01:46:07,833 --> 01:46:08,791
How did he know?

1633
01:46:08,875 --> 01:46:11,083
I think those vegetables
have been overcooked.

1634
01:46:11,166 --> 01:46:12,750
Boss...

1635
01:46:12,833 --> 01:46:14,750
You've got mail.

1636
01:46:15,291 --> 01:46:16,833
Brother...

1637
01:46:16,916 --> 01:46:19,500
-Seems like it's from master.
-Yes.

1638
01:46:26,291 --> 01:46:29,041
<i>Fatt, this is your master.</i>

1639
01:46:29,583 --> 01:46:31,500
<i>Excuse me, please come back.</i>

1640
01:46:31,583 --> 01:46:33,291
<i>Fatt, how have you two been?</i>

1641
01:46:33,375 --> 01:46:34,333
<i>-Master.</i>
<i>-First of all, congratulations.</i>

1642
01:46:34,416 --> 01:46:36,125
<i>I heard you're still the King of Mahjong.</i>

1643
01:46:36,208 --> 01:46:37,916
<i>I'm so proud of you and happy for you.</i>

1644
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,916
<i>But nothing beats knowing you two</i>
<i>are on good terms again.</i>

1645
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:42,083
<i>That is great news indeed.</i>

1646
01:46:42,166 --> 01:46:43,333
<i>I am doing really great over here.</i>

1647
01:46:43,416 --> 01:46:44,875
<i>I have blondes as my disciples.</i>

1648
01:46:44,958 --> 01:46:47,750
<i>Business is booming</i>
<i>and they all call me professor.</i>

1649
01:46:47,833 --> 01:46:49,708
<i>Professor.</i>

1650
01:46:49,791 --> 01:46:51,958
<i>America is a democratic country.</i>

1651
01:46:52,041 --> 01:46:53,416
<i>They're all very open-minded.</i>

1652
01:46:53,500 --> 01:46:55,166
<i>Your master practices</i>
<i>the Legendary Kung fu, right?</i>

1653
01:46:55,250 --> 01:46:56,541
<i>Have you been practicing the great condor?</i>

1654
01:46:56,625 --> 01:46:58,291
<i>I'm not going back anymore</i>
<i>it's so much better here.</i>

1655
01:46:58,375 --> 01:47:00,041
<i>Remember the "great condor", Fatt?</i>

1656
01:47:00,125 --> 01:47:02,833
<i>-Ah "Fuck"?</i>
<i>-Not this "Fuck", I meant that "Fatt".</i>

1657
01:47:02,916 --> 01:47:04,333
<i>Alright that's all, bye.</i>

1658
01:47:04,416 --> 01:47:06,666
<i>Shut it down, bye.</i>

1659
01:47:06,750 --> 01:47:07,625
<i>Your turn.</i>

1660
01:47:07,708 --> 01:47:09,666
-Let's take some pictures.
-Stand here.

1661
01:47:10,125 --> 01:47:11,625
This is for big brother.

1662
01:47:11,708 --> 01:47:13,666
Come on, look here.

1663
01:47:24,416 --> 01:47:27,083
-Sorry, master.
-It's okay.

1664
01:47:27,166 --> 01:47:29,583
Remember not to tell anyone I'm practicing
the Legendary Kung fu.

1665
01:47:29,666 --> 01:47:30,583
I won't.

1666
01:47:30,666 --> 01:47:33,041
You're practicing the Legendary Kung fu
for mahjong, right?

1667
01:47:33,125 --> 01:47:36,541
{\an8}It is the Legendary Kung fu all right,
but not for mahjong.

1668
01:47:36,625 --> 01:47:38,541
{\an8}They're for the "condor".

1669
01:47:38,625 --> 01:47:40,416
{\an8}Condor?

1670
01:47:40,500 --> 01:47:44,083
{\an8}Mahjong players spend a lot of time seated
which is very bad for the prostate.

1671
01:47:45,750 --> 01:47:47,166
I get it now.

1672
01:47:51,500 --> 01:47:53,125
Come here.

1673
01:47:54,458 --> 01:47:55,625
Brother...

1674
01:47:55,708 --> 01:47:57,625
You said after listening
to master's recording

1675
01:47:57,708 --> 01:47:58,958
you regained your confidence
to play mahjong.

1676
01:47:59,041 --> 01:48:01,083
Did master leave any message for me?

1677
01:48:02,708 --> 01:48:04,083
Yes or no?

1678
01:48:16,041 --> 01:48:18,708
If I press this button
everything will be history.

1679
01:48:18,791 --> 01:48:20,958
How does that make me
different from a dog?

1680
01:48:25,208 --> 01:48:27,166
<i>Quit horsing around, Fatt.</i>

1681
01:48:27,250 --> 01:48:28,291
<i>You think no one knows.</i>

1682
01:48:28,375 --> 01:48:30,083
<i>You listened to someone else's message.</i>

1683
01:48:30,791 --> 01:48:31,875
<i>Mind your own business.</i>

1684
01:48:31,958 --> 01:48:34,291
<i>You won't be coming back to find me.</i>

1685
01:48:35,541 --> 01:48:36,833
<i>Scared, aren't you.</i>

1686
01:48:37,750 --> 01:48:39,166
Screw you.

1687
01:48:39,250 --> 01:48:41,791
How is playing mahjong
a gambling addiction?

1688
01:48:41,875 --> 01:48:45,458
It's a good form of entertainment.

1689
01:48:45,750 --> 01:48:46,958
That's right.

1690
01:48:47,041 --> 01:48:51,375
These people betrayed the
original intent of mahjong.

1691
01:48:51,875 --> 01:48:55,125
They should be cursed for eternity.

1692
01:48:55,208 --> 01:48:56,833
Punished for their atrocities.

1693
01:48:56,916 --> 01:48:58,500
Give them two slaps
every time you see them.

1694
01:48:58,583 --> 01:49:00,166
Four slaps when you see them
the next time.

1695
01:49:00,250 --> 01:49:01,833
Six slaps
when you see them the third time.

1696
01:49:01,916 --> 01:49:03,083
See...

1697
01:49:04,625 --> 01:49:06,041
Therefore,

1698
01:49:06,250 --> 01:49:09,958
we have to play mahjong
with the right attitude.

1699
01:49:10,041 --> 01:49:11,833
Play it as a healthy form
of entertainment.

1700
01:49:11,916 --> 01:49:13,875
Play it to express your love
towards a cultural treasure.

1701
01:49:13,958 --> 01:49:16,916
Gong Xi Fa Cai and Happy Lunar New Year.

1702
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,625
May you all be surrounded by happiness.

1703
01:49:19,708 --> 01:49:21,375
May all your wishes come true.

1704
01:49:21,458 --> 01:49:24,541
And you'll have everything
that your heart desires.

1705
01:49:24,625 --> 01:49:26,708
Gong Xi. Gong Xi.

1706
01:49:26,791 --> 01:49:31,041
Happy Lunar New Year to everyone.

1707
01:49:37,458 --> 01:49:40,500
Let's get rich!
