1
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:12,090
Wait for me

2
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,680
Relax, we're just playing mahjong

3
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,160
Ah Fatt

4
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,860
Give me a serving of Three Great Scholars

5
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,030
Got it, no problem

6
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,800
- I'm on it - Be quick about it

7
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,450
White Dragon, Red Dragon, Green Dragon

8
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,990
Isn't that the Three Great Scholars?

9
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,920
Sassy, get to work

10
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,930
Pretty sure she's not here

11
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:17,080
Nancy, I've got your West Wind tile

12
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,390
- Let me send you to your doom - Pong

13
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,050
Watch it, or you'll meet your doom

14
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,930
- Green Dragon - Pong

15
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,430
You want to win? Dream on

16
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,140
Pong

17
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,630
Crap

18
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,440
Pong

19
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:35,710
Pong again and again

20
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,010
Don't bite off more than you can chew

21
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:40,480
Ah Lian you haven't ordered,
what do you want to eat?

22
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:44,520
I'm hungry two fishballs would be nice

23
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,480
I'm dizzy from al the
Pong that is going around

24
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,020
I need a Panadol

25
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,180
- Just that one capsule - One capsule

26
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,190
White Dragon

27
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,860
I'll Pong

28
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,330
Don't mess it up, can't you see
she's on to a Four Large Blessings hand

29
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,870
Don't make me lose my grocery money as well

30
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,600
Will it kill you to just let me win once?

31
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:05,040
Sure, the weakest hand shall prevail

32
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:08,630
Show me what you've got, dare you

33
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,140
North Wind

34
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,940
You scared me

35
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,480
Tiger, you want a Panadol, right?

36
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,620
I have one

37
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,950
Don't take everything you're offered

38
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:25,190
Even if you picked it up
yourself, double check

39
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,900
Kong

40
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,640
Jinx..

41
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,740
Kong again

42
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,400
Jinx..

43
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,540
Kong…pay up please

44
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,100
Here you go again

45
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,380
Three draws and you couldn't even get t,
you'll lose for sure

46
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,010
It ain't over until it's over

47
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,180
Come on, Nancy

48
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,380
Move aside

49
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:59,190
Jinx..

50
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:01,620
Three Circles

51
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,630
Self-Draw win

52
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,500
Four Small Blessings and three Kongs

53
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:06,830
How much do you think is the total winnings?

54
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,730
I'm a newbie at mahjong,
but this seems like a big win

55
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,930
Haven't you heard of "the weakest hand
shall prevail?

56
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,910
You watch out, the ghosts
might follow you home

57
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:15,330
If I knew I'd lose

58
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:18,070
I'd have gone home to watch
my wives play mahjong

59
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:21,040
Come on, we're neighbours, don't say that

60
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,950
A little gambling never hurt anyone

61
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:27,250
We're just having fun

62
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,050
Come on, pay up

63
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,660
- There goes my money - You little rascal

64
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:36,920
I asked you to pack yong tau fool

65
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:39,060
and here you are playing games

66
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,070
Stand right there, don't run

67
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,660
I won't f you stop chasing

68
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,760
Talking back now, eh?

69
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:52,170
Self-Draw win

70
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,540
The candy is mine

71
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,110
You' even settle for a Chicken Hand?

72
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,740
It'll bring bigger wins

73
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,410
Didn't you say you only
play but don't gamble?

74
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,480
That's why on y won some candy

75
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,890
And I'm the one who bought the candy

76
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,830
What's the matter? You want some?

77
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:11,590
No, today you're going to learn
how to lose gracefully

78
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,770
Alright, lets learn about sharing first today

79
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:22,800
What's the matter? Don t you want some candy?

80
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,540
Mr Yang

81
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:32,180
Well well well , look who we have here

82
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,580
Wayne Yang

83
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,950
Haven't I told you

84
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,990
not to gamble here after school?

85
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,020
Which part of that did you not understand?

86
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:44,120
We weren't gambling

87
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,070
Yeah, don't twist the facts,
we were just sharing candies

88
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,100
Did you see us gambling with your own eyes?

89
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:52,170
Although no money was involved

90
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,640
But playing mahjong is gambling

91
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,940
And that's wrong

92
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,600
Playing mahjong doesn't necessarily
mean we're gambling

93
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,670
I was teaching them mathematics and history

94
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,720
No, you were clearly gambling

95
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,950
Don't deny it

96
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,820
Deny? Don't you know?

97
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,150
This isn't just mahjong,
it's the essence of our culture

98
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,850
Go!

99
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,060
Mahjong is a card game created in China

100
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,630
Well-known and well-loved in the whole world

101
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:24,540
There are many different
theories on its origins

102
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,510
Due to the fact that it's
been around for so long

103
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:29,240
Some say that in 500 B.C

104
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,540
When Confucius was travelling all over China

105
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:34,180
He created the game mahjong
to spread his teachings

106
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:37,220
Using the three tiles of Red Dragon,
Green Dragon, and White Dragon

107
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,580
to represent the Three Virtues

108
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,680
love sincerity and filial piety

109
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,660
Commonly known as loyalty,
filial piety and righteousness

110
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,320
That's all good

111
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:49,960
But why do the tiles need to be so big?

112
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:51,930
You…

113
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,170
Such a big tile…

114
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,760
Carving such a big tile.

115
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:00,600
Right

116
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,040
That's correct

117
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:07,200
Later on, duel to different requirements

118
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,680
mahjong kept evolving

119
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:11,210
And finally settled with the 108-tile version

120
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:14,190
Representing the 108 warriors
of the Water Margin Legend

121
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,350
With the addition of various flower tiles

122
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:19,550
The whole set has 144 tiles

123
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,260
This is a flower

124
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,030
It's the bird

125
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,630
Centipede

126
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,730
It's a live, and it wants to bite me

127
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:37,680
Every player has 13 tiles

128
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,910
To represent the 13 weeks n a single season

129
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:43,110
There are 52 weeks in the four seasons,
totalling 364 days

130
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,720
The winning tile

131
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,380
represents the final day of a year

132
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:51,110
To make it 365 days, one complete year

133
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:56,460
Master, is there an ace tile to every suit?

134
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,260
Of course Little Monkey

135
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:02,430
Mah… mahjong

136
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,070
Pay… pay up

137
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:12,040
Playing mahjong is commonly
referred to by the Chinese

138
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:15,950
As playing eight rounds or "dry swimming"

139
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,540
A square table is used for playing mahjong

140
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:21,080
Which represents North, South, East, West

141
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,750
As well as Spring, Summer, Autumn Winter

142
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,290
- Four Bamboos - I'll take it

143
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,090
One tile discarded and three players win

144
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,830
Mahjong has been passed down for generations

145
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:41,600
Becoming a form of
entertainment in people's lives

146
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,970
Even the aunties enjoy a game of mahjong

147
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,340
Mahjong became a form of entertainment
and also a sport

148
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:48,610
It can foster relationships

149
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,510
Prevent Alzheimer's

150
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,290
Hurry up…

151
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,260
Finally I'm here

152
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:14,270
Come on

153
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,040
Eleven

154
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:24,550
Two Bamboos

155
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,850
Four Bamboos

156
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,810
I'll take it

157
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,360
One tile discarded and three players win

158
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,360
- Where are you going? - Toilet

159
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,360
- No way - You're wriggling out of this?

160
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:40,830
We've waited for a year for you
to walk to this table

161
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,870
You might take another two years
to walk to the loo

162
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,130
Pay up before you go

163
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:49,170
Now it's becoming ever more convenient
to play mahjong

164
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,510
It's even available online

165
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,210
We can play mahjong anytime

166
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,180
anywhere

167
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:02,080
See they are so well versed n history

168
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,350
You call this history?

169
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,380
Don't be a bad example to the kids

170
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:08,090
Everyone learns their history
from the TV these days

171
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,060
Nobody takes it seriously

172
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:12,660
At east their history improved

173
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:16,360
Since picking up mahjong
they've scored full marks in history

174
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,360
What's the matter?
Not willing to admit defeat?

175
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,270
Let's have a bet then

176
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,030
Sure…bring it on

177
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:25,100
Alright, same rules

178
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,270
If I win

179
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,250
you can't stop them from
coming to pay with me

180
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,510
And, you have to stop bothering me for a week

181
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:35,080
- And what if I win… - Okay

182
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,260
Dinner, movies, whatever you want

183
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:42,230
Everyone has 9 tiles, from One Character
to Nine Character

184
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,460
The first to complete the
suit n order shall win

185
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:48,790
Let's go

186
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,630
I'm done

187
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,600
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 correct

188
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:29,130
3 7 9 8 4 1 5 6 2 wrong

189
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,610
Sassy sister won

190
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,680
Mr. Yang lost

191
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,280
Sir

192
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,580
What a pity

193
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:42,450
Don't worry sir, you'll get used to losing

194
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,290
It's not your first time

195
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,520
losing to Sister Sassy anyway

196
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,790
Come let's continue playing

197
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,530
Let's carry on, Sir has to
go back to teaching

198
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,180
What's the matter? Are you okay?

199
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,020
I'm fine It's just that,
you eat with such elegance

200
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,990
As your father, I feel contented

201
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,660
That's great

202
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,280
- What do you think if.. . - Aright

203
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,850
- Actually… - I get it

204
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:55,460
- She.. - I said cut it

205
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,860
You want me to be like her

206
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:00,830
Talk softer, be more gentle,
like a lady right?

207
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,800
What's so bad about me now?

208
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,270
You are perfect as you are

209
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:12,580
- But if you could… - Dad

210
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,010
There are no ifs and buts in this world

211
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,960
I just want you to have a boyfriend

212
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,450
In case, one day, I'm not here anymore

213
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,290
Not here? Where are you going?

214
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,750
Back to meet my maker

215
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,660
Why would you meet your
maker all of a sudden?

216
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:33,460
Not all of a sudden

217
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:36,440
History tells us, people die

218
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,940
No, anyone can die except you

219
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:42,410
You can't leave me alone

220
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,750
Okay, I won t die then

221
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:48,270
That's more like it

222
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:55,780
But even if I don't d e
you'll still need to date

223
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:01,330
I think that Wayne Yang is not bad

224
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,090
You got to be kidding, Dad

225
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,650
Him? Not bad?

226
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:06,600
He's old-fashioned and dumb

227
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:09,230
He stutters and he can't even play mahjong

228
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,000
Every time I play with him, he loses

229
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:11,630
What's so good about him?

230
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,140
All those can be helped

231
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:16,870
Old-fashioned means he's honest

232
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,240
A slow talker is better than a smooth tailker

233
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:20,870
As for playing mahjong, it's easy to learn

234
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,220
What are you doing?

235
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:35,850
Hey

236
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:38,030
Hey

237
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,530
Are you guys serious?

238
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,540
Yep, it's here

239
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,370
Who's making a din here?

240
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,100
We're looking for Pak Chong Fatt where is he?

241
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,040
What Pak Chong Fatt? Hong Chong Fatt?

242
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,280
There's only Chow Yun Fatt

243
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,910
- Bugger off - Wong Tin Ba

244
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:37,450
Who's that guy?

245
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,220
He's the World Mahjong Champion

246
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,960
for 10 consecutive years

247
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,730
The modern day King of Mahjong, Wong Tin Ba

248
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:49,760
He's got style

249
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:53,400
What's wrong with the plastic bags today?

250
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,440
Those dace a so aren't fresh enough

251
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,810
Sassy, where did you get those plastic bags?

252
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,310
Where did you get those dace?

253
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:08,250
Hey there handsome,
how many seats do you need?

254
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,550
It's been a while, Pak Chong Fatt

255
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,650
What?

256
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:14,790
Pak Chong Fatt

257
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:17,300
Born on the 9th of October 1970

258
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,730
Libra 'O' blood type

259
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,630
His pass on is to help those in need

260
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,230
Cut the crap

261
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,300
Tell me what's their relationship

262
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:29,970
He was taught by the same
master as Wong Tin Ba

263
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,570
Rumour has it that,
after they turned on each other

264
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:35,910
Pak Chong Fatt vanished
from the world of mahjong

265
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,680
Brother Fatt is Pak Chong Fatt?

266
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,190
Are you sure you got the right person?

267
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:48,630
What do you think?

268
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:51,960
I never thought you could find me here

269
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,090
How's it going, my little brother?
It's been so long

270
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:55,970
Is this for your birthday party
or your daughter's wedding?

271
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:57,600
It's to challange you to a duel

272
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,470
The next mahjong championship is coming up

273
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,170
I must have a duel with you this time

274
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,470
It's been a while since I've played,
you should cut down too

275
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,610
I'll ask you again,
are you up for a duel or not?

276
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,340
- No thanks - Come on

277
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,290
- Nah - Come on

278
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:13,680
- No thanks - Come on

279
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:14,420
Nope

280
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,180
For god's sake quit dilly-dallying

281
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:17,850
Happiness can't be forced

282
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,620
Sometimes you need to
take a gamble for your happiness

283
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:21,390
You have no choice, because I have chosen you

284
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,620
I must gamble with you this time

285
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,700
Roasted drumstick

286
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,320
Such a pity, to become a
mute at such a young age

287
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,620
Alright, let's have a drumstick

288
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,360
- Girl - I'm not your daughter

289
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:33,520
I'm not your daughter,
and you're not my father

290
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:35,260
How did you find out?

291
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,900
Are you for real? I was just joking

292
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,270
How could it turn out that way?

293
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:44,440
I thought you were mute,
turns out you're a retard

294
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,510
You are as short as I am

295
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,140
Could you possibly be the daughter
of our neighbour, Tall Wai?

296
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,010
No matter what, from now on

297
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,550
You eat yours, I eat mine,
we stay out of each other's way

298
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,550
Why? We're a family

299
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,850
Have you ever considered me family?

300
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:58,020
- You seem pissed - You bet I am

301
00:19:58,090 --> 00:19:59,750
My father was the King of
Mahjong Pak Chong Fatt

302
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:02,320
And I only know it now You
see me as your family?

303
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:04,760
You've kept a lot of things from me as well

304
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:05,700
Like what, tell me

305
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:06,930
When you sat for your exam

306
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,730
you watched my romance
"action" videos instead of studying

307
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,670
and I didn't say anything

308
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,230
Alright, stop it

309
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,510
It's not that I don't want to tell you,
but you never asked

310
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:18,040
Why would I talk about these things
out of the blue

311
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,940
Okay, let me ask you now

312
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:23,150
Why sell yong tau foo when you can be
the King of Mahjong?

313
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,950
Let's grab a drumstick first before we start

314
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,040
Stop pretending or I'll chase you out

315
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:32,020
Once upon a time

316
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:34,530
Speak Mandarin, sit down

317
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,220
I thought for such an important event,
English would be more apt

318
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,460
English? Your English sounds like Tam

319
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,800
Don't try too hard

320
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,870
We'll have to start from 20 years ago

321
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:47,630
Hurry up

322
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,110
Twenty five years ago

323
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:54,170
Zhang Shun You, the Wong Tin
Ba of today, and I

324
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,840
Learnt mahjong together from our

325
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,040
Master Ru from a very young age

326
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:08,490
Five

327
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:12,360
Mine

328
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:13,820
Yours

329
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:15,500
Mine

330
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,130
Yours

331
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:18,370
Mine

332
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:20,070
Yours

333
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,400
Skip

334
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,040
Next

335
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,240
Reveal

336
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,280
The Thirteen Wonders

337
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:29,740
Your hand is

338
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:31,280
decided the moment the tiles are stacked

339
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,910
If you're not the dealer

340
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:35,580
Try to put your tiles over here

341
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,010
Look, they're all Bamboos

342
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:40,220
Told you…

343
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:42,990
Master always said, you win by not gambling

344
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:46,620
Winning or losing is just an illusion,
lose your money but never your life

345
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,960
Only the good-hearted wins

346
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,700
He also said,I often win because
I don't harp on winning or losing

347
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:57,240
Is it really that important,
winning or losing when playing mahjong?

348
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,370
You win this round,
you could well lose the next

349
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:00,570
What's the big deal

350
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,080
Green Dragon, Four Large Blessings

351
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,420
You need a single Eight Bamboo,
you have a full suit of Bamboos

352
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:14,020
You lack a tile of Green Dragon

353
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:16,760
How should I play this Green Dragon tile?

354
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,060
Ah Fatt, Ah You

355
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,430
I think it's time

356
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:28,060
So ear y? Didn't we just have our lunch?

357
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,610
All you think about is eating

358
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,170
I meant it's time you two have a duel

359
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:35,370
The winner will succeed
me as the King of Mahjong

360
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:37,550
What happens to the loser then?

361
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:39,320
He will become the junior fellow apprentice
of the King of Mahjong

362
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,090
Might as we be the sidekick

363
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,220
I didn't say anything

364
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,120
Alright, best of three rounds

365
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,550
Begin now

366
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,470
Five Circles

367
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,170
Game

368
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:06,140
- The Three Great Scholars - Wow, you're good

369
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:07,810
Wow, the Three Great Scholars

370
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,580
Thanks for the recognition

371
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:12,440
Alright. Self-Draw West Wind

372
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,820
Chicken Hand

373
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:16,150
Damn you

374
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,450
Why would you even win on a Chicken Hand

375
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,790
You like chicken that much

376
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,690
Do you even know how to play mahjong

377
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,970
Green Dragon

378
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:45,420
Game

379
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,040
The Thirteen Wonders

380
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:49,950
Master I've won two of the three rounds

381
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:53,020
I'm your successor, now teach me
the legendary mahjong kungfu

382
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,790
I'll announce who's the winner

383
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,060
Of course

384
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,500
The winner is

385
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,090
Ah Fatt

386
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,170
Why him?

387
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,500
That's the Thirteen Wonders right there

388
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,330
I didn't say the one who wins will succeed me

389
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:13,300
You're right

390
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,180
I knew it

391
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:17,720
No matter how I fare,
you'll always see me as the loser

392
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,650
- Ah You listen to me - Say no more

393
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,910
I've listened to you long enough

394
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,220
You talk all day long

395
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:24,810
I've had enough of it

396
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,750
From today onwards,
I'm not listening to you anymore

397
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,230
I'm not your discipel anymore

398
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:39,570
God brother

399
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,340
So that was how Wong Tin Ba left our master

400
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:45,710
And went on to challenge everyone everywhere

401
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,680
From India to Egypt

402
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,410
From Egypt to Japlan

403
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,480
From Japlan to the China

404
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:55,110
Challenging the Kings of
Mahjong of every region

405
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,320
Ninety Thousand (Nine Character)

406
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,090
Red Middle (Red Dragon)

407
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,620
Children

408
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:05,090
Two Circles

409
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:13,370
Big Four Happiness (Four
Large Blessings), game

410
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,050
Sensei

411
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:37,230
Get rid of the tiles that you don't need,
no point keeping them

412
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,230
Self-Draw

413
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,200
Why are you discarding your
self-drawn winning tile…

414
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,170
Mahjong?

415
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,900
Hold on

416
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,640
The Three Great Scholars

417
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:55,180
- After you - See you

418
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,110
Finally, Wong Tin Ba got what he wished for

419
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,810
He defeated all the best
mahjong players in the world

420
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:35,380
And even won the title of King of Mahjong
for 10 consecutive years

421
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,780
But one thing could never wrap my head around

422
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,760
You gave up the Green
Dragon tile for Wong Tin Ba

423
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:41,890
So by right he should've won

424
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,890
Why did your master
announce you as the window?

425
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,800
Later on, Master explained to me

426
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,100
I've lost

427
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:54,640
why did you say I won, master?

428
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,380
Do you think I'm a renovation contractor?

429
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,480
I can see

430
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,540
He won in the game of mahjong

431
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,710
But lost duel to his character

432
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:08,750
My successor must have a good character

433
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,250
Winning without character s meaningless

434
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:41,850
It's been days since I heard from you
where have you been?

435
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,190
Everywhere

436
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,880
Any place where I won't see a poker face

437
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,790
a black face and two stupid faces

438
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:49,560
I've been there

439
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,010
You two look very free

440
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:07,970
Why don't you go accomplany the boss

441
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:18,250
Spend some time with your dad

442
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,850
Don't keep avoiding him

443
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,790
I'll just be another black face

444
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,220
Doesn't make a difference

445
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:40,080
You find that funny?

446
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,610
Don't you?

447
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,710
Yes

448
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,080
It's really hilarious

449
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:48,810
Why did you hit me?

450
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,610
Hit me? You…

451
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:54,460
How dare you lay your finger
on the great Wong Tin Ba

452
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:15,850
Game, 108 Warriors of…

453
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,480
What are you doing?

454
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:19,540
There are mosquitos

455
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,810
I have such a big house

456
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:23,980
This mosquito is actually my brother

457
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:26,290
He talks to me, through h s buzzing

458
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,190
Now that you killed it
who's going to talk to me?

459
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,460
You don't talk to me

460
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:31,620
And I don't want to talk to these two

461
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,730
You three jump into the water

462
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:35,930
Where did Deedee Zhang go again?

463
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:47,080
Right?

464
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,810
There you are

465
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,320
Baby who's that?

466
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:52,850
Who are you?

467
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,290
He should know who I am

468
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:20,710
Pure Honour Hand, Four Large Blessings,
Full Blossoms

469
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,980
- That's 88 folds, everybody - What a big win

470
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:26,710
It's nothing

471
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,950
What are you doing?
Where did the extra tiles come from

472
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,420
Hey are you trying to cheat here?

473
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:33,890
Cheating?

474
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,190
Are you kidding me?

475
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,060
It's written here No cheating

476
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:38,860
Do you think I'm blind?
Do you think I'm stupid?

477
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:41,400
Stop mucking about,
do you know what you're talking about?

478
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:44,060
They say bringing mahjong tiles
around this year brings good luck

479
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:46,070
And you thought I'm cheating…

480
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:52,000
What took him so long

481
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:52,480
Do you know what time it is now?

482
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,240
Must've come from here

483
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:57,280
What's with the crowd?
Did Michele Yeoh turn up?

484
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:59,880
All the neighbours want
you to be their master

485
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:01,080
I'm number 15 in line

486
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:02,920
You people are crazy

487
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:04,250
When did I say I'm accepting disciples?

488
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,260
You're Pak Chong Fatt

489
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:07,990
The first ever King of Mahjong,
of course we'd like to learn from you

490
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,720
If you're here for the
Tofu, I'm more than happy

491
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,100
But if you're here to learn
mahjong, please leave

492
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:24,680
Master I've been having a bad hand in mahjong

493
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,680
Any tips?

494
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:29,150
That's your fate

495
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,510
Don't ask me how would I know?

496
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,950
Why are two of you

497
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:35,150
holding me down instead of standing in line?

498
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,350
I listen clearer

499
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,860
and learn more this way

500
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:41,320
My reason is simple, just want to touch you

501
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,120
Do it on me first

502
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,700
You're such a pain

503
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:56,810
Come on, teach me a few tricks

504
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:59,880
Which one of you is Pak Chong Fatt?

505
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:07,340
am, what's the matter?

506
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,690
- Who? - Sure y not me

507
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,160
It's him

508
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:15,060
You two idiots

509
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,190
It's me

510
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,660
Miss, may I know what you're doing here?

511
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:23,460
I suppose you don't remember
the King of Gai Hu?

512
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,230
The one whom I defeated

513
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,670
in the inaugural championship?

514
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:29,470
That's right, he s my father

515
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,700
So you're his daughter

516
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,240
Come and give Uncle Fatt a hug

517
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:35,980
Come on

518
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,170
That year

519
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:42,190
He made it to the final s against all odds

520
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,380
But you beat him hands down

521
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,430
Since then he became like that

522
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:49,860
Never to smile again

523
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,390
Alright, since you're here

524
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,900
I'll let you have vengeance

525
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,560
You two, go distract her

526
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,570
Actually, we…

527
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:01,500
Today

528
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,740
Let us have a due

529
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:05,610
- Hey, you - You're up

530
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,140
I already said I've forgotten
how to play mahjong

531
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:09,680
If you don't play, you'll get it from us

532
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,740
Come on, if not now then when

533
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,750
If you don't play,
we'll annoy the he out of you

534
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,790
- I'll pester you - Won't leave you alone

535
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:16,860
Come on, play with her

536
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:20,750
Alright then

537
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:23,090
Let's do this

538
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:37,200
- Four Circles - Pong

539
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,250
East Wind

540
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,550
One Circle

541
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,770
Pong One Circle, here's a Four Circles tile

542
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:48,990
Lucky you getting the final tile

543
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,320
South Wind

544
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:57,320
Want to make a Pure Hand of Circle,
watch me spoil it

545
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:02,930
Eight Circles

546
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,990
Pong

547
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:06,800
Nine Circles

548
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:09,440
Pong, here's a Seven Circles

549
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:10,570
Pong Seven Circles

550
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:14,640
9 Pieces Penalty, it's on you
if he were to win

551
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:22,580
I'm sorry Hidden Six Circles Kong

552
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:23,990
Self-Draw win on Replacement Tile

553
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,290
I must win to make my father smile again

554
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:31,990
Five Circles

555
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,890
Get a Self-Draw win, come on

556
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,600
Kong

557
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,040
Eight Circles

558
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:05,820
Two Character

559
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:07,350
I'll take that Two Character

560
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,790
I'll discard a One Character

561
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,500
Game

562
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,130
What?

563
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,010
You're waiting for a single tile
of One Character. Snatch her game

564
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,050
That's none of your business

565
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,810
Are you playing or am I playing?

566
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:25,110
They came so far for revenge, w nning on
a Ch cken Hand doesn't make sense

567
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,350
Chicken Hand, are you for real?

568
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:30,180
That's a bit too lame, don't you think?

569
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,490
It's called a Chicken Hand

570
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,820
of course it's lame

571
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:39,760
I've waited 20 years for this

572
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:41,860
I finally got my revenge

573
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,770
To be able to pay with a mahjong expert
like Pak Chong Fatt

574
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:49,170
Look, your father is smiling again

575
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,540
You shouldn't have waited
for so long for that

576
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:52,840
f you had understood this 20 years ago

577
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:55,350
You wouldn't have been upset for so long

578
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:58,110
Playing mahjong is just
a form of entertainment

579
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,450
When it's done, get on with it

580
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:00,710
That's a load of bull

581
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:03,750
Remember how I've taught you?

582
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:04,790
What should be done after you've lost?

583
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,200
What do you want?

584
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:22,530
Good manners

585
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,000
Thank you

586
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:33,780
Don't even think of kissing me, I'll hit you

587
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,190
Ramona

588
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:48,530
It really is you

589
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:52,900
Sir, have you seen my husband?

590
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:56,100
What's the matter with you?
Don't you recognise me?

591
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,300
I'm your husband, Ah Fatt

592
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,340
It can't be

593
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:02,740
My husband is very handsome

594
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:05,080
He's tall and macho

595
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:07,250
And he's very good at mahjong

596
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,220
Look

597
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,750
Take a good look at yourself

598
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,280
Not the chest, the tattoo

599
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,540
It's the same, look

600
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:36,910
This type of tattoo is so common

601
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:42,780
My husband is so handsome, so macho

602
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:46,480
But you're short and stout,
and you look so shifty

603
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,690
And you stink

604
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:49,190
How could you be my husband?

605
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:49,790
There are so many people here

606
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:52,160
can you cut me some slack?

607
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,530
But you're not my husband

608
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,660
I really am your husband

609
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,000
You're not

610
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:00,770
- I am - You're not

611
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:03,110
You leave me with no choice

612
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:05,110
But to share this with everyone

613
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:07,380
Your body anatomy s very weird

614
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:08,740
If I touch you here, you'll scream

615
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:10,850
If I touch you here, you'll get excited

616
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,450
If I touch your head you'll be obedient

617
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:15,480
Am I right?

618
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,150
Shut up

619
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,690
How come you know so much about me?

620
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,190
Because I'm your husband

621
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,320
- Ah Fatt? - Yes

622
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:29,170
Come on

623
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,700
Where is this place?

624
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:33,030
This is not a common place,
it s Brother Fatt's house

625
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:35,870
- Isn't that my house? - Yes

626
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:40,150
Nan Yang

627
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:42,270
Didn't I come from a rich household?

628
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,640
Come have a seat

629
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,570
I'll get you a drink

630
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:48,350
Sassy, we have a guest

631
00:38:57,730 --> 00:38:59,160
Look who's here

632
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:00,600
Who's so important?

633
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,930
Take a look yourself

634
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:04,760
Hey is this your wife?

635
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:08,260
His wife? She left a long time ago

636
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:10,400
Why is your wife so bad?

637
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,170
That's not all, she's materialistic, greedy

638
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:16,740
- Ridiculous, shameless… - Sassy

639
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,180
How can you insult your mother
when she's right in front of you?

640
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:20,580
At east turn around

641
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,310
She's really your mother

642
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,750
- My mother? - My daughter

643
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,050
That is correct

644
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,460
Your mother's daughter is you…
right, that makes her your mother!

645
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:28,790
Why did you bring her home?

646
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:30,920
Don't tell me we need to
seek your permission first

647
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,060
This is my home, not yours

648
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:35,730
Hey you said this s my home
isn't it Ah Fatt's home?

649
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,170
Your home has been broken

650
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:39,000
since you left us when I was 2 years old

651
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,900
Stop arguing

652
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:42,840
Yes

653
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:45,610
I know this is a bit too sudden for you

654
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:47,910
It's the same for me

655
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:50,110
Did you know, when I saw her alone today

656
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,240
Looking for her husband on the streets

657
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:53,880
Isn't she looking for me?

658
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,910
But she couldn't recognise me,
even though I'm so handsome

659
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:58,790
The only thing she recognises is money anyway

660
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,620
Don't be fooled by her

661
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:02,090
I'm not that stupid

662
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,750
I brought her to the doctor, the doctor said…

663
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:05,320
Apparently a year after she left us

664
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,990
She lost her memory after an accident

665
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,160
Lost her memory?

666
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:10,790
Is this some sort of lame soap opera plot

667
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:13,700
Soap operas are indeed lame

668
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:16,330
But she really is your mother

669
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:22,580
It' hasn't been easy for her,
being alone all these years

670
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:26,280
You'll understand these matters of the heart
when you grow up

671
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,190
You can see for yourself

672
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:37,790
Who in the right mind eats mahjong tiles?

673
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:43,490
What? I'm hungry

674
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:46,070
You're not supposed to eat mahjong tiles

675
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:48,330
I'll cook for you if you are hungry

676
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:49,770
Let's go outside

677
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,880
Loss of memory?

678
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,120
Mom

679
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:03,490
Let me teach you how to play mahjong today

680
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,050
Mahjong? Is it fun?

681
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,490
It's okay if you don't know

682
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,620
Within a few days and a few losses

683
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,790
You'll get the hang of it

684
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,030
Come on

685
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,430
I've got no money

686
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:16,330
If I lose, I only have
my daughter to offer you

687
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,030
Let us restart the game,
since she just sat down

688
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,540
- Sure - Let's go

689
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,400
Eight Circles

690
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,280
Nine Character

691
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:31,580
Can I win now?

692
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,280
You don't have enough folds

693
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:36,650
Just follow whatever the others are doing

694
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:38,820
Discard that Nine Character tile

695
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:45,420
Three Character

696
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:49,230
Can I win now?

697
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,930
How is it possible that you still can't win

698
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,400
Self-Draw, game

699
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:56,910
The Thirteen Wonders

700
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:58,810
You scared the daylight out of me

701
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:08,190
I can't see through this mess

702
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:13,650
Eight-and-a-half Pairs Pure Hand

703
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,950
Is that a big win?

704
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:16,460
I win

705
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:19,620
Pay up

706
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:42,440
Five Bamboos

707
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:50,990
Self-Draw

708
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,760
Nine Gates Hand

709
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,970
Pay up, please

710
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,830
Are you sure you are crazy?

711
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,160
It really doesn't seem like it

712
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,260
Thank you

713
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:01,240
When are we going to play again?

714
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:03,740
Come earlier tomorrow,
and you can play with yourself

715
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:05,570
Who's going to play with you again

716
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,940
First time and we've already lost so much

717
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:10,500
Do you know how many people
I'll have to massage to learn this much

718
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:12,110
I lost my grocery money again

719
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:16,180
Girl, they are such sore losers

720
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,690
Ignore them, we're rich

721
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,290
What are you doing?

722
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,830
Sewing on some buttons

723
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,900
I saw the buttons on your father's clothes

724
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:35,630
they don't match

725
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:37,040
Every single one of them

726
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:40,210
If you really cared for him,
you wouldn't have left

727
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:47,640
I was wrong

728
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:53,180
thought could live a good life
having married the King of Mahjong

729
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:56,020
But he suddenly quit

730
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:59,160
I got angry, so I left in a fit of anger

731
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:05,130
I never thought it'd be so hard to turn back

732
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:08,600
I know you both are still mad at me

733
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:11,200
I've got nothing to say

734
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:16,040
If you really don't want to see me

735
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:18,280
I can leave any time

736
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,950
I'm really leaving

737
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:33,360
Take care of your father, I'm leaving

738
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:34,820
You come and go as you please

739
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:35,920
you think this is a hotel?

740
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:39,460
I've taken care of your
husband all these years

741
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:41,100
It's your turn now

742
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:46,280
One more thing

743
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:50,050
Don't be fooled by his carefree out look

744
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:52,710
He's never forgotten you

745
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:54,750
Take good care of him

746
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:26,910
It's so hot

747
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:49,170
I want to be a responsible husband

748
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:57,520
What kungfu is he practising?

749
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:59,920
Could it be the legendary mahjong kungfu?

750
00:46:09,830 --> 00:46:11,320
Ah, so you've invited yourself

751
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,490
Drinking alcohol in broad day light

752
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,400
Sassy doesn't care about me anymore

753
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:22,970
What makes you say that?

754
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:25,140
She's been Ignoring me…

755
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:27,140
I think It's time to let her go

756
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:28,980
She only cares for her mom right now

757
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:32,380
What about my life? I'm hopeless

758
00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:33,940
So that's what you think

759
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:36,040
You're too pessimistic

760
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:39,050
I know my daughter

761
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,890
Her anger is fleeting

762
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:44,730
It doesn't matter if she's angry with me

763
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:49,460
The point Is I don't have
a place in her heart

764
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:51,630
I'm not important to her

765
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:53,470
If that's the case

766
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:56,210
Then why would she have wagers with you?

767
00:46:56,910 --> 00:46:58,640
Because she wants to defeat me

768
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:00,340
She wants me to back off

769
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:02,380
That silly girl

770
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:06,340
Every time she plays mahjong with you
she looks at you in a different way

771
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:09,220
Doesn't that prove that she likes you?

772
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,520
Remember, to be a good man…

773
00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:14,920
One must not be greedy

774
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:16,920
And one must not be impatient

775
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:19,690
Even you have the lousiest hand

776
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:20,930
Don't be afraid

777
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:24,770
Sometimes, to lose is to win

778
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:27,040
Get it?

779
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,910
To lose is to win

780
00:47:36,110 --> 00:47:38,880
I get it

781
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:41,220
Thank you

782
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:43,190
I understand now

783
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:45,880
Thank you

784
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,720
Sassy, here I come

785
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:52,590
Most handsome guys in this world are dumb

786
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:57,660
Sister Sassy is having a
duel with Mr. Yang again

787
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:00,600
Ready,go

788
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:14,320
So fast? Let's reveal it and see

789
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:18,920
Sir, don't you know 1, 2, 3?

790
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:20,420
What are you doing?

791
00:48:20,490 --> 00:48:21,580
Are you trying to be funny?

792
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:23,250
Sorry

793
00:48:23,330 --> 00:48:25,320
Give me one last chance

794
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,160
One last chance, let's do this again

795
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:36,170
Every time she plays mahjong with you
she looks at you in a different way

796
00:48:48,290 --> 00:48:50,810
Wow Sister Sassy wins again

797
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:52,750
But Mr. Yang completed his hand first

798
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:54,120
So what?

799
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:55,520
I'm pretty sure it's a mess again

800
00:48:55,590 --> 00:48:56,890
Reveal

801
00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:00,860
Wow Mr. Yang

802
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:03,600
You're good, you've won

803
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:08,200
Very good, you've defeated me.
Don't look for me anymore

804
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:09,800
Sassy

805
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:12,610
Sassy

806
00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:14,610
What do you want?

807
00:49:15,710 --> 00:49:17,310
You've said before

808
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:19,850
If I want to date you,
I'll have to defeat you first

809
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,550
So can I ask you out on a date now

810
00:49:22,990 --> 00:49:24,180
Suits you

811
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:26,880
But I'm telling you,
I have no feelings for you

812
00:49:26,990 --> 00:49:30,290
Then why is It that whenever
I play mahjong with you

813
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:33,350
you always gaze at me so gently?

814
00:49:37,470 --> 00:49:38,830
Rubbish

815
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:49,750
Brother Fatt told me

816
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:53,910
As long as you're the apple of my eye
and vice versa

817
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:56,650
Winning or losing isn't important at all

818
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:01,460
I…

819
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:04,690
Let's get together

820
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:24,380
Apparently when you fall for someone

821
00:50:24,450 --> 00:50:28,320
You'll feel happy even when he defeats you

822
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:32,190
That's life But hey, what's wrong with that

823
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:36,020
From the moment you fell for him,
you've already lost

824
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,290
Brother Fatt

825
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,200
You're such an expert in love

826
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:43,600
So why did you break up with mom in the past?

827
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:49,810
Because of love

828
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,780
We went separate ways

829
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:59,240
Your mom and I grew up together

830
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:01,410
She was the girl that everyone coveted

831
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,280
Self-draw win, The Thirteen Wonders

832
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:03,650
Smart and pretty

833
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,150
Good at mahjong too

834
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:08,320
She was known as The
Queen of Thirteen Wonders

835
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:11,420
Look at her smile

836
00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:13,890
Makes my heart skip a beat

837
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,200
We got married later on

838
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:29,110
I won the World Mahjong
Championship that year

839
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:32,150
And became the King of Mahjong

840
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:52,500
- Are you sure? - Is that necessary?

841
00:51:52,570 --> 00:51:54,300
I really can't take it anymore

842
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:56,870
Ramona and I were soulmates

843
00:51:56,940 --> 00:52:00,540
Since our dating days,
we enjoyed playing mahjong together

844
00:52:00,610 --> 00:52:02,740
Such a lovely couple

845
00:52:02,850 --> 00:52:04,940
Hubby

846
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:06,980
She was the only person who could

847
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:09,320
defeat me at the mahjong table

848
00:52:09,490 --> 00:52:12,650
This Green Dragon tile is annoying me,
watch me discard it

849
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:17,360
Four Large Blessings, pay up

850
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:19,800
You knew she wanted the Green Dragon,
yet you discarded it

851
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:22,360
Men

852
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:24,100
Hubby, quick, pay up

853
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:25,460
What's going on

854
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:26,090
- She's giving birth - What's going on

855
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:26,930
Give me that

856
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,670
Ramona gave birth soon after

857
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:33,210
That was the happiest time of our lives

858
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,040
Six Circles

859
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:36,770
Sassy

860
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:41,090
Two Circles

861
00:52:41,190 --> 00:52:43,210
But good times never last

862
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:46,520
Before the 2nd World Mahjong Championships

863
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:49,390
was very stressed

864
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:50,890
I was terrified of

865
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,230
losing my status as the world champion

866
00:52:56,770 --> 00:52:58,130
At that moment

867
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:59,360
I realised playing mahjong

868
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,300
no longer means the same anymore

869
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:05,500
I started having second thoughts

870
00:53:15,790 --> 00:53:16,910
Hubby

871
00:53:17,590 --> 00:53:19,680
I've cooked some ginseng chicken

872
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:23,290
To help you become the King of Mahjong
for the 2nd time

873
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:26,990
I'm a little reluctant to go

874
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:30,190
Why?

875
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:32,170
I feel like…

876
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:33,740
Playing mahjong for the sake of competition

877
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:36,570
seems to be deviating
from its original intent

878
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:38,910
As long as you win every time

879
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:41,040
What other purpose do you need?

880
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:43,610
That's not what master taught me

881
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,180
I'm warning you

882
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:48,880
because I saw a bright future in you

883
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:50,750
I'm investing my youth in you

884
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:52,760
I won't allow you to give up

885
00:53:54,090 --> 00:53:55,250
Ramona don't go

886
00:53:55,330 --> 00:53:57,800
What's going to happen to me and Sassy
if you leave?

887
00:53:57,860 --> 00:53:59,850
My husband the King of Mahjong,
is now a useless man

888
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:02,630
Why should I stay?

889
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:04,900
What will it take to make you stay?

890
00:54:04,970 --> 00:54:06,670
Play a round with me

891
00:54:06,770 --> 00:54:09,600
If you win, you can give
the competition a miss

892
00:54:09,670 --> 00:54:10,870
If I win

893
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:13,100
you have to clinch the
World Mahjong Championship

894
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:14,870
You can't force me like this

895
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:16,710
You're the one forcing me to do this

896
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:19,440
I could've become the Queen of Mahjong

897
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:22,150
I gave up everything to marry you,
the King of Mahjong

898
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:24,810
Now you're telling me to give up my dream

899
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:29,480
Let's play a round then

900
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:38,160
White Dragon

901
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:41,130
Kong

902
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:43,670
Four Character

903
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:48,110
Red Dragon

904
00:54:48,510 --> 00:54:49,480
Kong

905
00:54:52,550 --> 00:54:53,680
Eight Circles

906
00:54:58,190 --> 00:54:59,880
Green Dragon

907
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,220
Kong

908
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:05,990
Seven Bamboos

909
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:10,790
I used to let her win all the time

910
00:55:10,870 --> 00:55:12,860
But this time

911
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,050
Ramona

912
00:55:37,430 --> 00:55:38,450
Chicken Hand

913
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:42,230
I'm not that important to you after all

914
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:51,770
Little did she know that
I let her go on purpose

915
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:55,840
Although I didn't want to complete anymore

916
00:55:55,910 --> 00:56:00,370
But she was still so young.
She should pursue her dreams

917
00:56:00,450 --> 00:56:02,440
I didn't want to hold her back

918
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:08,750
Your wife was heartless, didn't it hurt you?

919
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:12,990
That's how youngsters are, they want glamour

920
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:15,790
Who doesn't want to be the Queen of Mahjong

921
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:20,570
Do you still love your
wife then, Brother Fatt?

922
00:56:21,970 --> 00:56:23,600
Of course

923
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:26,910
Every second of my life

924
00:56:37,490 --> 00:56:40,420
So handsome, let's put that on Facebook

925
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:43,320
Boss

926
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,300
Handsome should be one word, not two

927
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:49,760
I did it on purpose

928
00:56:49,830 --> 00:56:52,170
If not, you wouldn't have come in

929
00:56:54,970 --> 00:56:55,800
Boss

930
00:56:56,310 --> 00:56:58,140
People are slamming you on Facebook

931
00:56:58,210 --> 00:56:58,870
What are they saying?

932
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:01,450
They say handsome "should be one word"

933
00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:03,310
Take that picture down immediately

934
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:06,780
Then upload other stuff to distract them

935
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:09,450
Avoid bad publicity before
the World Mahjong Championships

936
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:10,820
Okay

937
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,290
How do I spell surprise?

938
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:14,520
Just write it in Chinese

939
00:57:14,990 --> 00:57:17,690
Good idea. Surprise

940
00:57:18,830 --> 00:57:22,390
Boss, you're so wise what's the surprise?

941
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:25,830
The first ever King of Mahjong versus
the winner for 10 consecutive years

942
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:27,430
Surprising enough?

943
00:57:28,270 --> 00:57:29,930
Oh Boss, so you're the
first ever King of Mahjong

944
00:57:30,010 --> 00:57:32,480
Only now do I know that Pak Chong Fatt
had won't for 10 consecutive years

945
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:36,810
I've fed and clothed you two

946
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,510
Yet you don't even know who's who

947
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:39,980
Look at those trophies behind

948
00:57:40,050 --> 00:57:42,280
use them to store my sauces

949
00:57:42,350 --> 00:57:43,150
can't you see

950
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:50,530
What plans do you have?

951
00:57:52,730 --> 00:57:55,700
Everything is going according to plan

952
00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:16,550
I smell yong tau foo,
this should be the house

953
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:26,460
I'll take it

954
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:28,430
The Thirteen Wonders

955
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:13,900
Crazy

956
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:16,140
Can't you walk properly?

957
00:59:16,210 --> 00:59:19,180
Boss, you already came in this dressing
with a bell in hand

958
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,720
Sure y I have to pretend to be possessed
to complement you?

959
00:59:21,790 --> 00:59:23,120
Don't talk crap

960
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:23,950
You've been here for so long

961
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:25,180
why haven't you reported to me?

962
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:27,150
Have you found out

963
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:28,990
what kungfu Pak Chong
Fatt has been practising?

964
00:59:29,430 --> 00:59:32,360
Yes, I found out that he doesn't
even touch mahjong

965
00:59:37,070 --> 00:59:38,000
That's great

966
00:59:38,170 --> 00:59:40,540
I finally have reason to sell you to Ethiopia

967
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:42,000
Just great

968
00:59:42,070 --> 00:59:44,130
They suffer from famine and poverty

969
00:59:44,210 --> 00:59:45,570
they won't be able to “use” me

970
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:48,370
They can't use you, but they can eat you

971
00:59:49,010 --> 00:59:50,610
Your skin is slightly wrinkled

972
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:52,150
but your flesh is still quite tender

973
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:53,380
- Please, don't - Should worth a dime or two

974
00:59:54,750 --> 00:59:56,050
I did find out a secret of his

975
00:59:56,150 --> 00:59:57,350
What secret? Out with it

976
00:59:57,620 --> 00:59:59,110
He practises a kind of kungfu everyday?

977
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:00,260
What kungfu?

978
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:03,960
Pa ms joined with eyes focused

979
01:00:04,030 --> 01:00:07,050
Tongue and limbs stretched out

980
01:00:11,370 --> 01:00:14,240
- Rein in the temples and diaphragm

981
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:16,860
Take in the energy of the universe
to nourish the brain

982
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:21,140
So, this is Master's Legendary Mahjong Kungfu

983
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:23,250
Who's peeping?

984
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:34,490
I get it now

985
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:39,630
If Pak Chong Fatt can master it, so can I

986
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:43,260
Let's see who's the real King of Mahjong

987
01:00:43,570 --> 01:00:46,560
Your mission now is to persuade him

988
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:48,400
to join the championships

989
01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:52,670
Only then will your mission be complete

990
01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:05,080
Let's see how you resist my cajolement

991
01:01:06,690 --> 01:01:08,180
Hubby

992
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:14,690
Let's eat first

993
01:01:16,670 --> 01:01:18,640
Hubby

994
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:23,130
I have something… to tell you

995
01:01:23,570 --> 01:01:26,200
What do you want?

996
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:27,570
I want to say…

997
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:29,550
We're back

998
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:32,940
Dad, mom

999
01:01:37,490 --> 01:01:38,610
Fill the bowl

1000
01:01:40,990 --> 01:01:42,320
Have they gotten married?

1001
01:01:42,430 --> 01:01:43,590
Last I checked, they weren't married yet

1002
01:01:43,930 --> 01:01:45,090
I really have something to tell you

1003
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:46,720
Why not put that back to where it should be?

1004
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:49,930
So much food today?
Is there some offering to the gods?

1005
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,900
No, since your mum came back

1006
01:01:51,970 --> 01:01:53,990
we haven't had a sumptuous meal

1007
01:01:54,140 --> 01:01:55,610
Thanks to you, mom

1008
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:56,970
Come let's dig in

1009
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:58,410
Let's dig in

1010
01:02:19,130 --> 01:02:21,260
What did you want to say just now?

1011
01:02:21,330 --> 01:02:23,430
Nothing

1012
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:26,990
I feel like we're a family

1013
01:02:27,070 --> 01:02:29,940
What's wrong with you?
We really are a family okay

1014
01:02:30,310 --> 01:02:32,610
By the way, when did you marry my daughter,
may I ask?

1015
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:34,650
Last night

1016
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:36,410
You marry my daughter in my room?

1017
01:03:03,940 --> 01:03:05,530
So handsome

1018
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:11,040
Hubby

1019
01:03:11,850 --> 01:03:14,250
Am I interrupting your kungfu practice?

1020
01:03:17,090 --> 01:03:20,680
Are you sure this is related to…mahjong?

1021
01:03:26,230 --> 01:03:27,390
Here it comes

1022
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:29,090
I can feel it

1023
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:37,670
Since you left, I…

1024
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:43,080
- You haven't done "it" for 20 years? - Yes

1025
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:46,210
I've practised the Legendary Mahjong Kungfu
for quite some time now

1026
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:48,220
You guys are practising mahjong with me today

1027
01:03:48,290 --> 01:03:51,280
I was afraid after not using it for so long,
it will…

1028
01:03:51,390 --> 01:03:53,580
That's why I…

1029
01:04:05,470 --> 01:04:07,330
Are you waiting for the Six and
Nine Character tiles?

1030
01:04:10,540 --> 01:04:12,510
You need a single Three Character tile

1031
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:16,600
You want the Six and Nine
Circles tiles, right?

1032
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:20,780
How do you know?

1033
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:23,750
You won't feel much in the beginning

1034
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:26,760
But after 49 practice sessions

1035
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:29,620
Your carnal desire

1036
01:04:29,690 --> 01:04:32,790
will explode from within

1037
01:04:35,330 --> 01:04:36,730
How does it feel like?

1038
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:38,430
It feels like someone opened the zoo gates

1039
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:40,230
and all the elephants charging out

1040
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:00,550
Boss, don't…

1041
01:05:02,130 --> 01:05:03,560
Boss, I'm warning you I'm very experienced

1042
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:06,830
Once you start, I won't stop

1043
01:05:16,710 --> 01:05:18,040
What are you doing?

1044
01:05:32,890 --> 01:05:35,020
- Hey - You old and cheap woman

1045
01:05:35,130 --> 01:05:37,320
Why don't you dig a hole and bury yourself

1046
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:38,920
Don't let me see you again

1047
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,520
Sorry, boss

1048
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:42,160
I was about to call you

1049
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:45,460
The kungfu that Ah Fatt has been practising
isn't for mahjong

1050
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:48,970
- It's for his little brother, right? - Yes

1051
01:05:49,310 --> 01:05:51,370
You might as well tell me after my "little
brother" is injured from overexertion?

1052
01:05:52,610 --> 01:05:55,770
If you can't make Pak Chong Fatt
join the championships

1053
01:05:55,850 --> 01:05:57,810
I'll sell you to Ethiopia

1054
01:05:57,880 --> 01:05:59,320
As for the gambling debts you owe me

1055
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:03,250
I'll cut your fingers off one by one

1056
01:06:03,350 --> 01:06:04,510
That's all

1057
01:06:08,190 --> 01:06:10,590
Wong Tin Ba I shall remind you again

1058
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:12,530
Don't say I'm long-winded

1059
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:15,160
Your 10-year good fortune is coming to an end

1060
01:06:15,230 --> 01:06:17,360
If you want good fortune for another 10 years

1061
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:21,600
You must defeat Pak Chong Fatt
at the championships this year

1062
01:06:22,570 --> 01:06:26,840
You're not just long-winded,
you're ridiculously long-winded

1063
01:06:26,910 --> 01:06:28,710
Can you turn on the heater now?

1064
01:06:38,390 --> 01:06:40,190
Don't tell me these vicious-looking people

1065
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:42,250
are here for my yong tau foo so early?

1066
01:06:43,890 --> 01:06:46,690
- Hubby - Dear

1067
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:52,100
It wasn't easy finding mum back with us

1068
01:06:52,170 --> 01:06:54,190
and now she's taken away from us again

1069
01:06:54,270 --> 01:06:56,710
This won't do, I must look for my mum

1070
01:06:57,140 --> 01:06:57,970
If it's a kidnap

1071
01:06:58,080 --> 01:06:59,630
why haven't we received any calls yet?

1072
01:07:07,020 --> 01:07:09,250
- Help - Ramona?

1073
01:07:10,450 --> 01:07:12,220
You recognise your wife's voice, right?

1074
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:14,250
- What do you want? - So cruel

1075
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:15,690
Very simple, If I see you

1076
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:18,790
as one of the players in the
World Mahjong Championship

1077
01:07:19,330 --> 01:07:20,660
you'll see her

1078
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:22,130
If I don't see you then

1079
01:07:22,230 --> 01:07:23,890
you won't see her for the rest of your life

1080
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:26,730
- Help - Ramona?

1081
01:07:30,510 --> 01:07:32,480
- So? - Yeah, what now?

1082
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:38,410
Brother Fatt is finally going back
to the mahjong table

1083
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:40,310
Let's welcome back Brother Fatt

1084
01:07:42,190 --> 01:07:44,120
I'm very proud to be able to practise
and play with you

1085
01:07:44,190 --> 01:07:46,450
I don't know why I'm very anxious suddenly

1086
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:50,090
Why? Ah Fatt, we're here to practise with you

1087
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:53,460
According to the module I've designed

1088
01:07:53,530 --> 01:07:55,360
The first session should be…

1089
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:57,090
Drawing tiles

1090
01:07:57,170 --> 01:07:58,640
Everybody draw your own tiles please

1091
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:00,830
Draw the Thirteen Wonders
in the shortest time possible

1092
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:02,870
You can't look at the tiles while drawing

1093
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:28,800
- Is this the correct way? - You're good

1094
01:08:28,870 --> 01:08:30,770
Next, let's practise how to tabulate points

1095
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:33,330
Tell me the points the
moment I reveal my hand

1096
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:36,030
These are the initial tiles of a dealer

1097
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:38,170
That's Four Small Blessings, totals 13 points

1098
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:40,210
No, it's a so a Mixed Pure Hand,
you've got to add 3 points

1099
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:41,540
So the total should be 16 points

1100
01:08:41,610 --> 01:08:43,050
- That's a lot of "fun" - No

1101
01:08:43,110 --> 01:08:44,550
If it's a dealers initial hand
it's a Heavenly Hand

1102
01:08:44,650 --> 01:08:47,310
A Heavenly, Mixed Pure Hand
with Four Small Blessings is 29 points

1103
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:49,320
What about this one?

1104
01:08:57,430 --> 01:08:59,290
Four Large Blessings 13 points
Mixed Pure Hand 3 points

1105
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:00,350
Triplets Hand 3 points

1106
01:09:00,430 --> 01:09:02,560
including the flowers is a total of 20 points

1107
01:09:03,230 --> 01:09:05,700
Excellent

1108
01:09:06,970 --> 01:09:08,400
How many points are there in this one?

1109
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:12,070
Hold on, give us some time

1110
01:09:12,180 --> 01:09:16,270
This hand s neither here nor there

1111
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:18,510
Obviously it's a Chicken Hand

1112
01:09:18,580 --> 01:09:20,020
Genius

1113
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:22,050
- You're a gambling genius - My idol

1114
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:24,880
Don't be so cliche,
we're learning from one another

1115
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:27,620
I don't think you need to
practise the basics anymore

1116
01:09:27,730 --> 01:09:29,520
Why don't we go straight into competition

1117
01:09:29,590 --> 01:09:30,920
Sure

1118
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:35,250
I'm so nervous

1119
01:09:35,330 --> 01:09:36,860
Hold it

1120
01:09:36,930 --> 01:09:39,730
I've never been this nervous playing mahjong
in the past decades

1121
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:42,800
I'm a little apprehensive about playing
against my master today

1122
01:09:56,820 --> 01:10:00,920
- Dad - Brother Fatt

1123
01:10:00,990 --> 01:10:02,020
What's the matter with you?

1124
01:10:07,630 --> 01:10:09,500
- Dad - How are you feeling?

1125
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:13,160
- Lie down - Thanks

1126
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:16,470
It's no big deal

1127
01:10:16,540 --> 01:10:18,240
But I think I can t go to the competition

1128
01:10:18,310 --> 01:10:19,780
Why?

1129
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:22,740
You were killing it in the beginning

1130
01:10:22,810 --> 01:10:24,680
What happened?

1131
01:10:24,980 --> 01:10:26,280
I wanted to win

1132
01:10:26,350 --> 01:10:27,580
This is what happens when
you're too eager to win

1133
01:10:28,150 --> 01:10:29,310
That's why I

1134
01:10:29,390 --> 01:10:31,720
pulled out of the second world championships

1135
01:10:32,860 --> 01:10:34,760
I don't play to win

1136
01:10:36,990 --> 01:10:38,690
With this mentality

1137
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,420
how am I to defeat Wong Tin Ba?

1138
01:10:55,810 --> 01:10:57,300
Let's begin the day

1139
01:11:04,220 --> 01:11:06,780
Where are you going so early?

1140
01:11:07,790 --> 01:11:09,160
Sassy

1141
01:11:22,070 --> 01:11:23,370
Ah Fatt

1142
01:11:23,710 --> 01:11:25,800
Letter for you from Sassy

1143
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:33,680
I'm eloping with Wayne Yang

1144
01:11:33,750 --> 01:11:35,340
Don't worry, it's just for a few days

1145
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:37,080
We'll be home once we've had enough fun

1146
01:11:37,190 --> 01:11:40,680
So this is Sassy's final move

1147
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:44,990
Ah Fatt, you've raised a daughter
with such fine character

1148
01:12:29,410 --> 01:12:30,600
Ah Fatt

1149
01:12:30,670 --> 01:12:33,700
I knew you'd come back to find me

1150
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:36,840
I know Ah You all too well

1151
01:12:36,910 --> 01:12:38,750
Since the day I announced your victory

1152
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:40,940
I knew he'd never let it go so easily

1153
01:12:41,020 --> 01:12:44,220
But I'm traveling the word now

1154
01:12:44,290 --> 01:12:47,690
You need to settle your own problems

1155
01:12:47,990 --> 01:12:50,760
A word of advice before I leave

1156
01:12:50,830 --> 01:12:53,160
You don't have much weaknesses

1157
01:12:53,260 --> 01:12:55,230
Except you think too much

1158
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:57,130
If you weren't like that

1159
01:12:57,230 --> 01:12:59,860
Ramona probably wouldn't have left

1160
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:03,270
Your life would've been complete

1161
01:13:03,340 --> 01:13:04,740
Do you remember?

1162
01:13:04,810 --> 01:13:08,870
I told you, the true spirit
of playing mahjong

1163
01:13:11,010 --> 01:13:13,410
The tiles don't determine winning or losing

1164
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:15,320
The player does

1165
01:13:15,390 --> 01:13:17,910
The tiles are lifeless, but the player isn't

1166
01:13:17,990 --> 01:13:20,820
Playing mahjong is like learning
how to be a good person

1167
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:25,450
If you get too caught up in winning or losing

1168
01:13:25,530 --> 01:13:27,290
even if you have the best hand,
it'll a I be in vain

1169
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:29,460
- One Cirle - Game

1170
01:13:29,730 --> 01:13:31,930
The Three Great Scholars,
Triplets, Mixed Pure Hand

1171
01:13:37,810 --> 01:13:38,710
Green Dragon

1172
01:13:38,810 --> 01:13:40,300
- You're so smart - Game

1173
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:43,310
You're not affected by the outcome anymore

1174
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:45,870
How can you ever be defeated?

1175
01:13:47,990 --> 01:13:50,450
It's only after 20 years

1176
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:52,680
that I began to understand this saying

1177
01:13:53,390 --> 01:13:55,120
Am I slow?

1178
01:13:56,030 --> 01:13:57,360
Luckily It's still in time

1179
01:14:29,830 --> 01:14:32,160
You really want to do this yourself?

1180
01:14:32,230 --> 01:14:36,330
I have my dad's genes,
sure y I won't come in last

1181
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:37,870
And the most important thing is

1182
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:38,990
I can take the opportunity to look for my mom

1183
01:14:39,070 --> 01:14:39,540
Ms Deedee Zhang

1184
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:42,300
Welcome to the King of Mahjong Championships

1185
01:14:42,370 --> 01:14:43,840
- It's her? - You know each other?

1186
01:14:44,340 --> 01:14:45,570
I've seen her before

1187
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:50,470
We meet again, isn't that fate?

1188
01:14:51,380 --> 01:14:54,210
So that's your type

1189
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:56,810
What type? What do you mean by that?

1190
01:14:56,890 --> 01:14:58,580
Why would you know someone like that?

1191
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:00,950
That night inbed

1192
01:15:01,060 --> 01:15:04,120
you said you would love me forever

1193
01:15:06,930 --> 01:15:08,230
Since It's none of your business

1194
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:09,360
are you still trying to be a hero?

1195
01:15:09,430 --> 01:15:12,060
I'll whoop your ass Miss Third Party

1196
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:14,100
Miss, don't be too sad

1197
01:15:14,170 --> 01:15:15,040
Sad?

1198
01:15:15,110 --> 01:15:17,370
I'm more than thrilled to see them fall apart

1199
01:15:17,540 --> 01:15:20,070
That's how she ruined a couple the other day

1200
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:22,110
Just because she couldn't stand them

1201
01:15:28,490 --> 01:15:31,080
I'm the type that he likes

1202
01:15:31,150 --> 01:15:34,210
and he's been devoted to me all these years

1203
01:15:34,290 --> 01:15:36,660
What? Are you jealous?

1204
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:41,060
Why are you talking to
these people in public?

1205
01:15:41,130 --> 01:15:42,600
Deedee Zhang

1206
01:15:43,470 --> 01:15:45,560
Who are you? And who are they?

1207
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:47,100
Aren't you afraid of
diminishing your own status?

1208
01:15:56,980 --> 01:16:00,380
Why? Where did your arrogance go?

1209
01:16:00,620 --> 01:16:02,080
Initially there was just Wong Tin Ba

1210
01:16:02,150 --> 01:16:04,880
Now there's another Deedee Zhang
how are we going to win?

1211
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:06,350
Are you nuts

1212
01:16:06,460 --> 01:16:07,550
Why are you putting

1213
01:16:07,620 --> 01:16:08,990
your own team down?

1214
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:10,560
Dad, what are you doing?

1215
01:16:10,630 --> 01:16:12,320
I want to come and play mahjong here

1216
01:16:12,430 --> 01:16:14,420
Why are you dressed like that here?

1217
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:18,030
I'm a man how can I
let my daughter battle this alone

1218
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:20,000
Brother Fatt, you really are my idol

1219
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:20,930
Of course

1220
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:22,540
I thought you had no confidence?

1221
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:23,630
Initially I didn't

1222
01:16:23,770 --> 01:16:26,500
Now do, or how else do we save your mum?

1223
01:16:27,410 --> 01:16:28,240
Dad

1224
01:16:29,010 --> 01:16:30,170
It's good that you're conf dent

1225
01:16:30,550 --> 01:16:34,420
But, the way you're dressed…

1226
01:16:34,650 --> 01:16:36,380
- I think it looks good - No way

1227
01:16:36,890 --> 01:16:39,520
The first ever King of
Mahjong must look the part

1228
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:42,080
We still have time

1229
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:44,750
- Let's go - Where to?

1230
01:16:46,230 --> 01:16:48,420
Not only do I want to win this competition

1231
01:16:48,970 --> 01:16:51,400
I want the two of you to make the finals
no matter what it takes

1232
01:16:51,700 --> 01:16:54,470
I want Pak Chong Fatt to be disgraced
in the mahjong world

1233
01:16:54,540 --> 01:16:56,510
I want him to hit rock bottom

1234
01:16:57,870 --> 01:16:58,570
Yes

1235
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:03,300
Do you understand?

1236
01:17:05,180 --> 01:17:06,380
Yes

1237
01:17:07,580 --> 01:17:09,750
I've waited for this for 20 years

1238
01:17:10,150 --> 01:17:11,780
I'll finally have my vengeance

1239
01:17:30,910 --> 01:17:32,740
Hello everyone

1240
01:17:32,810 --> 01:17:36,070
Welcome to the 12th King of Mahjong
World Championship

1241
01:17:36,180 --> 01:17:40,050
- I'm your emcee, Mushroom - I'm Sea Cucumber

1242
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:42,610
Not only do we have the
best of the best players this year

1243
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:45,710
we also have a huge
surprise for everyone today

1244
01:17:45,790 --> 01:17:47,520
We have invited an

1245
01:17:47,590 --> 01:17:51,050
incredibly unexpected special guest

1246
01:17:51,260 --> 01:17:54,590
The first ever King of Mahjong

1247
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:57,220
Pak Chong Fatt

1248
01:18:03,140 --> 01:18:05,340
Mr Pak Chong Fatt,
you're the first ever King of Mahjong

1249
01:18:05,410 --> 01:18:06,380
Is Wong Tin Ba the reason

1250
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:07,670
you came out of retirement?

1251
01:18:07,740 --> 01:18:09,710
Is it because no one's been able to
defeat him in the past 10 years?

1252
01:18:09,780 --> 01:18:10,870
And you think you can?

1253
01:18:10,950 --> 01:18:12,570
Are you confident of beating him?

1254
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:14,650
To be honest, in terms of playing mahjong

1255
01:18:15,590 --> 01:18:17,950
Can you not throw it anymore?

1256
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:19,350
It looks cool, master

1257
01:18:19,420 --> 01:18:21,390
I know, but it hurts

1258
01:18:21,460 --> 01:18:22,320
Thank you

1259
01:18:22,430 --> 01:18:25,450
Mahjong is a form of entertainment

1260
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:28,730
If you pay to win, it loses its meaning

1261
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:35,340
Ah Fatt, we're here to support you and Sassy

1262
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:37,570
- Give it your best shot - You can do it

1263
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:38,440
Thank you

1264
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:39,830
Where's Ah Lian?

1265
01:18:39,940 --> 01:18:42,810
She's busy doing plastic surgery

1266
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:45,310
Do you think I need plastic surgery as well?

1267
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:47,650
Absolutely

1268
01:18:48,450 --> 01:18:49,780
Let's play mahjong first

1269
01:18:50,650 --> 01:18:53,420
Will the inaugural King
of Mahjong pit against

1270
01:18:53,490 --> 01:18:55,010
the King of Mahjong of 10 consecutive years?

1271
01:18:55,190 --> 01:18:56,590
Today's competition is more exciting
than ever before

1272
01:18:56,660 --> 01:18:59,250
Relax, just relax

1273
01:18:59,460 --> 01:19:00,430
Okay

1274
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:02,190
This is so hot, what should I do?

1275
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:03,260
Just a little while more

1276
01:19:03,330 --> 01:19:04,320
I can't take it anymore

1277
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:11,330
Give it your best shot, Ah Fatt

1278
01:19:11,410 --> 01:19:12,570
We're right behind you

1279
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:14,170
Thanks

1280
01:19:17,950 --> 01:19:21,080
I didn't want to wear this coat,
it was my daughter's idea

1281
01:19:21,150 --> 01:19:23,280
- Understood - Good

1282
01:19:29,830 --> 01:19:32,590
And now, ladies and gentlemen

1283
01:19:32,660 --> 01:19:36,660
The champion for 10 years
in a row, Wong Tin Ba

1284
01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:38,790
And his daughter, Deedee Zhang

1285
01:19:38,870 --> 01:19:42,270
As well as his disciple, Icy

1286
01:19:44,170 --> 01:19:44,870
Mr. Wong Tin Ba

1287
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:47,140
are you confident of reigning the throne?

1288
01:19:47,210 --> 01:19:49,470
Are you conf dent of
defeating Pak Chong Fatt?

1289
01:19:49,550 --> 01:19:52,040
Don't go, we still have questions for you

1290
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:56,690
Do you think you look
good in that garbage bag?

1291
01:19:57,190 --> 01:19:58,280
Hello

1292
01:20:08,900 --> 01:20:11,230
That's him, don't take him seriously

1293
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:21,840
As always

1294
01:20:21,910 --> 01:20:24,970
In the preliminary round,
the first contestants to score 20 points

1295
01:20:25,050 --> 01:20:27,920
will have their bulbs lit up
each bulb represents 2 points

1296
01:20:28,020 --> 01:20:29,580
They will then proceed to the next round

1297
01:20:29,650 --> 01:20:31,590
This process shall be repeated
until we reach the semi-finals

1298
01:20:31,690 --> 01:20:34,320
If no one manages to get all their bulbs lit

1299
01:20:34,390 --> 01:20:36,050
The highest scorer will
proceed to the next round

1300
01:20:36,130 --> 01:20:39,320
Three winners from the semi-finals

1301
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:42,060
Will get to challenge our
10-year champion for the title

1302
01:20:42,130 --> 01:20:46,570
Let's kick off this year s
King of Mahjong World Championship

1303
01:21:01,450 --> 01:21:02,710
Heavenly Hand

1304
01:21:02,790 --> 01:21:04,310
Are you kidding me?

1305
01:21:05,290 --> 01:21:08,260
First to qualify for the
semi-finals is Ms Icy

1306
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:14,020
Game, Earthly Hand

1307
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:17,390
Second contestant to advance to the
semi-finals, the daughter of Wong Tin Ba

1308
01:21:17,470 --> 01:21:18,230
Deedee Zhang

1309
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:19,060
Congratulations

1310
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:21,070
Will the father and daughter

1311
01:21:21,140 --> 01:21:22,260
be challenging each other for the title?

1312
01:21:22,340 --> 01:21:24,600
Let's keep our eyes peeled

1313
01:21:27,110 --> 01:21:31,880
Four Large Blessings, Concealed,
Mixed Pure Hand, All Terminal
Three Hidden Treasure

1314
01:21:33,950 --> 01:21:36,890
Pak Chong Fatt's daughter
also made it into the semi-finals

1315
01:21:36,950 --> 01:21:39,720
- Congratulations Ms Sassy Bai - Sassy won

1316
01:21:39,790 --> 01:21:41,780
Come have a seat, Sassy

1317
01:21:42,790 --> 01:21:44,350
You were great

1318
01:21:55,470 --> 01:21:56,670
It's already the final round

1319
01:21:56,770 --> 01:21:58,330
Do you think Brother Fatt
will get full lights

1320
01:21:58,440 --> 01:21:59,840
That doesn't matter

1321
01:21:59,940 --> 01:22:01,810
What's important is to win

1322
01:22:11,550 --> 01:22:12,580
North Wind

1323
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:20,630
Pong

1324
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:23,190
Discarding a character
tile to lure my North Wind

1325
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:25,790
Trying to draw a snake out of its hole

1326
01:22:27,570 --> 01:22:29,000
I can see through that

1327
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:32,960
North Wind

1328
01:22:35,380 --> 01:22:36,810
Win

1329
01:22:37,250 --> 01:22:38,650
What a fine round

1330
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:40,980
What a move by Pak Chong Fatt

1331
01:22:41,050 --> 01:22:43,210
Making the semi-finals with the highest score

1332
01:22:43,290 --> 01:22:44,690
He won by a hair's breadth

1333
01:22:44,750 --> 01:22:46,420
Ah Fatt, you were awesome

1334
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:47,990
You's re so good

1335
01:22:49,260 --> 01:22:51,820
It wasn't a landslide win,
but you have such good skills

1336
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:54,800
And what a character, I am deeply humbled

1337
01:22:54,860 --> 01:22:56,260
It's just a game

1338
01:22:57,370 --> 01:22:59,530
It's just a game

1339
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:01,690
Pak Chong Fatt

1340
01:23:01,770 --> 01:23:04,930
You purposely discarded a tile
for the player with the lowest score

1341
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:06,540
Good

1342
01:23:07,940 --> 01:23:11,380
A hypocrite, but I like

1343
01:23:30,030 --> 01:23:31,560
After the preliminary qualifying matches

1344
01:23:31,630 --> 01:23:34,360
The semi-finals will commence now

1345
01:23:41,950 --> 01:23:43,570
- East Wind - I'll take that

1346
01:23:46,620 --> 01:23:48,110
Chicken Hand

1347
01:23:50,450 --> 01:23:51,780
- Five Bamboos - That's right

1348
01:23:51,890 --> 01:23:54,450
Take the in-betweens

1349
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:57,790
- Chicken Hand again

1350
01:23:59,830 --> 01:24:01,020
- East Wind - I'll take that

1351
01:24:01,770 --> 01:24:04,100
East Wind two points

1352
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:06,930
Can he win like that?

1353
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,770
It's a race between the hare and the turtle

1354
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:11,740
This move is called stuffing yourself up

1355
01:24:11,810 --> 01:24:15,010
A few small wins make for a big win

1356
01:24:17,380 --> 01:24:18,610
- One Bamboo - I'll take that

1357
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:20,310
Chicken Hand

1358
01:24:23,650 --> 01:24:27,380
Mahjong, Self-Draw three points, sorry

1359
01:24:27,620 --> 01:24:29,390
As expected

1360
01:24:29,460 --> 01:24:30,820
See I was right

1361
01:24:30,890 --> 01:24:33,120
- the turtle won - Mr Pak
Chong Fatt is the first

1362
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:36,390
- to make it to the finals - Congratulations

1363
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:41,090
Next, we shall witness
the battle of the century

1364
01:24:47,140 --> 01:24:48,270
You can do it

1365
01:25:06,430 --> 01:25:07,520
Look

1366
01:25:07,630 --> 01:25:11,120
She's got so many flower tiles

1367
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:14,570
If she wins this round, it's a lot of points

1368
01:25:14,670 --> 01:25:16,140
If she makes it into the finals

1369
01:25:16,210 --> 01:25:19,370
She will be working against
Brother Fatt for Wong Tin Ba

1370
01:25:21,740 --> 01:25:28,650
I'll Jinx that.. jinx…

1371
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:31,590
Self-Draw win, Pure Honour Hand,
Three Great Scholars

1372
01:25:31,690 --> 01:25:33,850
We jinxed the wrong one

1373
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:35,120
How many points is that?

1374
01:25:35,190 --> 01:25:37,520
A lot, for sure

1375
01:25:37,590 --> 01:25:39,890
Our second finalist s Ms Icy

1376
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,190
Congratulations

1377
01:25:44,530 --> 01:25:46,430
Who will be the final player

1378
01:25:46,540 --> 01:25:47,870
in the finals?

1379
01:25:49,140 --> 01:25:50,830
So nerve-wracking

1380
01:25:52,910 --> 01:25:55,640
But if you look at Sassy Bails and
Deedee Zhang's table

1381
01:25:55,710 --> 01:25:59,110
this is an inverse duel between their fathers

1382
01:26:02,420 --> 01:26:03,510
Brother Fatt

1383
01:26:04,250 --> 01:26:05,520
Ah Fatt

1384
01:26:15,830 --> 01:26:17,030
Go

1385
01:26:20,140 --> 01:26:21,760
Oh, what a klutz, Deedee Zhang

1386
01:26:21,870 --> 01:26:24,600
She accidentally revealed a tile
and is now disadvantaged

1387
01:26:24,670 --> 01:26:26,370
Luckily it's just a Formed Meld

1388
01:26:26,440 --> 01:26:27,880
Two Circles, Open Kong

1389
01:26:28,950 --> 01:26:31,280
Robbing the Kong, win

1390
01:26:34,420 --> 01:26:36,180
That's a Trick Hand

1391
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:37,750
You were waiting for the Two Circles,
Five Circles and Eight Circles tiles

1392
01:26:37,820 --> 01:26:39,850
You passed up that Eight Circles just now,
and you didn't draw

1393
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:41,190
How can you take the Two Circles now?

1394
01:26:41,260 --> 01:26:43,250
Right, according to the rules

1395
01:26:43,330 --> 01:26:45,230
she can't take this tile

1396
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:48,390
But she's already revealed her hand,
so it's considered a Trick Hand

1397
01:26:48,460 --> 01:26:50,460
- Yes - We are at the last round

1398
01:26:50,570 --> 01:26:52,800
and it's a tie between
Deedee Zhang and Sassy Ba

1399
01:26:52,900 --> 01:26:54,730
Deedee's Trick Hand causes her

1400
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:57,170
loss to Sassy by a hair's breadth

1401
01:27:00,180 --> 01:27:01,540
Sassy

1402
01:27:01,610 --> 01:27:04,270
That's right, she won, that's my daughter

1403
01:27:15,490 --> 01:27:16,960
Don't you remember what I've taught you?

1404
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:20,790
Do you have polio?

1405
01:27:21,330 --> 01:27:23,630
You can't even hold on
to an Eight Circles tile

1406
01:27:24,230 --> 01:27:27,000
This is a mistake only an idiot will make

1407
01:27:27,940 --> 01:27:30,500
It's my mistake, but I didn't mean it

1408
01:27:31,270 --> 01:27:33,140
It's not whether you meant it or not

1409
01:27:33,210 --> 01:27:35,470
It's about how I'm going to
face the public from now on

1410
01:27:35,550 --> 01:27:38,240
You're my daughter, Deedee Zhang

1411
01:27:38,310 --> 01:27:40,440
I don't want you to be
number one in anything else

1412
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:43,280
I only want you to be number one in mahjong

1413
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:46,820
Since I'm such an embarassment
to you, I'll leave

1414
01:27:47,160 --> 01:27:48,650
You're leaving…

1415
01:27:48,730 --> 01:27:51,560
Who's gonna take photo
with me later when I win?

1416
01:27:52,430 --> 01:27:54,920
You'd ruin my perfect father image

1417
01:27:58,070 --> 01:27:59,660
If she really leaves

1418
01:27:59,740 --> 01:28:02,860
Cancel all her credit cards for me

1419
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:09,540
The most exciting match
and the best of the best

1420
01:28:09,610 --> 01:28:12,010
is unfolding right before us

1421
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:16,950
The finals of this year's
King of Mahjong Championship starts now

1422
01:28:24,860 --> 01:28:26,260
What's the matter?

1423
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:28,890
- Are you nervous? - A little

1424
01:28:28,970 --> 01:28:31,490
Are you worried that you
won't draw a good hand?

1425
01:28:31,570 --> 01:28:33,870
Sometimes I can't get good ingredients
from the market

1426
01:28:33,940 --> 01:28:35,400
but I still have to cook

1427
01:28:35,510 --> 01:28:37,500
You can do it if you put your heart into it

1428
01:28:37,570 --> 01:28:39,340
Chicken Hand is also considered a win

1429
01:28:39,410 --> 01:28:41,880
Don't be afraid of losing just do it

1430
01:28:49,420 --> 01:28:50,440
Brother

1431
01:28:51,690 --> 01:28:53,620
Don't call me that

1432
01:28:53,960 --> 01:28:57,390
From now on, you'll have to call me
the King of Mahjong for 11 consecutive years

1433
01:28:57,960 --> 01:29:00,950
Did you eat a lot of
garlic? Your mouth stinks

1434
01:29:01,060 --> 01:29:02,500
He does have a better chance

1435
01:29:02,570 --> 01:29:04,360
Cut the crap

1436
01:29:04,430 --> 01:29:07,200
- I'll finish you off in
one round - Of course

1437
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:25,350
Let's see what you guys have in hand

1438
01:29:25,420 --> 01:29:26,620
Red Dragon

1439
01:29:26,690 --> 01:29:27,990
Pong

1440
01:29:35,300 --> 01:29:36,960
Let's move in for the kill then

1441
01:29:37,030 --> 01:29:38,330
Red Dragon

1442
01:29:44,740 --> 01:29:47,040
- Green Dragon - Pong

1443
01:29:55,850 --> 01:29:58,410
I'll just follow your lead, Green Dragon

1444
01:29:58,490 --> 01:29:59,650
Why did you do that?

1445
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:02,520
I told you before, learn how to
be a good person before learning mahjong

1446
01:30:02,630 --> 01:30:06,530
People might think you're talking about them

1447
01:30:06,630 --> 01:30:10,000
This is your elder show some respect

1448
01:30:10,100 --> 01:30:12,230
That's right, you need to respect your elders

1449
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:14,060
Stop chiding your daughter

1450
01:30:14,140 --> 01:30:15,970
She's just following the bad example you set

1451
01:30:16,040 --> 01:30:18,800
It's genetics

1452
01:30:20,310 --> 01:30:22,500
You already have both Green and Red Dragons

1453
01:30:22,610 --> 01:30:24,080
Are you going to get the White Dragon too

1454
01:30:24,180 --> 01:30:26,310
That would be such a coincidence

1455
01:30:26,380 --> 01:30:27,210
Pong

1456
01:30:28,150 --> 01:30:30,120
Why are you so careless?

1457
01:30:30,190 --> 01:30:32,350
That's a Three Great
Scholars you just gave away

1458
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:33,440
And you asked me to show him respect?

1459
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:35,650
How would I know he has all three dragons?

1460
01:30:35,730 --> 01:30:37,850
And you know how much I hate those tiles

1461
01:30:40,060 --> 01:30:41,120
Nine Bamboos

1462
01:30:44,630 --> 01:30:45,790
Nine Bamboos

1463
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:49,200
Nothing from you?

1464
01:30:49,310 --> 01:30:50,430
Watch me then

1465
01:30:52,710 --> 01:30:53,680
East Wind

1466
01:30:53,740 --> 01:30:54,800
Pong East Wind

1467
01:30:55,750 --> 01:30:58,340
I have to be smart about this

1468
01:30:58,410 --> 01:30:59,680
I have to let dad Pong

1469
01:31:00,050 --> 01:31:01,910
- One Circle - Pong

1470
01:31:05,490 --> 01:31:06,320
South Wind

1471
01:31:06,390 --> 01:31:07,650
Pong South Wind

1472
01:31:09,190 --> 01:31:11,220
- Two Circles - Pong

1473
01:31:12,930 --> 01:31:14,230
West Wind

1474
01:31:14,330 --> 01:31:15,700
Pong West Wind

1475
01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:20,330
You'll have to cover all losses if you
were to gift her a Four Large Blessings

1476
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:21,340
Three Circles

1477
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:24,240
Even the blind could tell
you can't discard a North Wind tile now

1478
01:31:26,740 --> 01:31:28,610
Icy, prepare to Pong

1479
01:31:28,710 --> 01:31:30,340
How would you know?

1480
01:31:30,410 --> 01:31:32,880
I'm the King of Mahjong

1481
01:31:32,950 --> 01:31:34,510
I'll shout it out for you

1482
01:31:34,580 --> 01:31:36,210
Pong Two Character

1483
01:31:40,620 --> 01:31:42,750
She only needs another tile to win

1484
01:31:44,430 --> 01:31:46,260
I can't discard the North Wind

1485
01:31:48,230 --> 01:31:50,560
- Three Bamboos - I'll take that

1486
01:31:51,470 --> 01:31:53,800
How? It should be hers, not yours

1487
01:31:53,900 --> 01:31:55,460
Don't you know the rules?

1488
01:31:55,570 --> 01:31:58,540
Take it, even though it's nothing much

1489
01:31:58,910 --> 01:32:00,380
Four Small Blessings

1490
01:32:01,980 --> 01:32:02,710
Sassy

1491
01:32:02,780 --> 01:32:03,970
Winning (eat) with a Four
Small Blessings hand

1492
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:07,020
She's devouring herself

1493
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:09,550
Are you playing or is she playing?

1494
01:32:09,620 --> 01:32:12,090
If you're playing for real ,
she should be on her own

1495
01:32:12,150 --> 01:32:14,550
If you were to team up and bully her

1496
01:32:14,620 --> 01:32:16,060
Why don't you two share a hand

1497
01:32:17,260 --> 01:32:19,920
Boss can't defeat them with a single bow

1498
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,560
That's a first in 10 years

1499
01:32:22,630 --> 01:32:25,660
Pak Chong Fatt is really something

1500
01:32:25,770 --> 01:32:27,200
What the…

1501
01:32:29,070 --> 01:32:30,230
I'm letting you win this round

1502
01:32:30,310 --> 01:32:32,900
since you're not so bright

1503
01:32:33,340 --> 01:32:35,440
Let's break for 15 minutes and resume later

1504
01:32:35,510 --> 01:32:37,910
Don't take heart, thats how he is

1505
01:32:40,820 --> 01:32:43,150
There will be a 15-minute
interval see you later

1506
01:32:43,220 --> 01:32:44,620
See you later

1507
01:32:47,620 --> 01:32:49,490
I realised that you're rather fidgety today

1508
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:52,190
You'll raise your chest when you
hold big tiles, that's not good

1509
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:54,160
Be more mindful of it

1510
01:32:54,260 --> 01:32:55,590
Daughter of Wong Tin Ba

1511
01:32:55,670 --> 01:32:58,030
Come with me, I have something to show you

1512
01:33:00,170 --> 01:33:01,570
Your father said

1513
01:33:02,440 --> 01:33:04,370
What kind of wife did Ah You marry

1514
01:33:04,470 --> 01:33:06,670
for him to have a such a tanned
and skinny daughter

1515
01:33:07,580 --> 01:33:09,240
Pak Chong Fatt is here for the championship

1516
01:33:09,310 --> 01:33:11,010
I have completed my
mission, where's my money?

1517
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:14,780
I want it now

1518
01:33:16,690 --> 01:33:18,380
So little?

1519
01:33:18,750 --> 01:33:19,980
I've settled your gambling debts

1520
01:33:20,060 --> 01:33:22,680
Food and accommodation at
my house cost money, too

1521
01:33:23,160 --> 01:33:24,790
- What a cheapskate - Beat it

1522
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:29,320
You couldn't discard the North Wind tile,
that's right

1523
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:32,330
You couldn't discard any Bamboo
tiles as well, yet you did

1524
01:33:35,300 --> 01:33:37,330
So everything was a lie

1525
01:33:38,740 --> 01:33:40,730
It's not too late to realise that

1526
01:33:42,010 --> 01:33:43,440
You came back to find us

1527
01:33:43,510 --> 01:33:44,810
because he paid you to do it

1528
01:33:45,450 --> 01:33:46,470
That's right

1529
01:33:46,550 --> 01:33:48,570
I've succeeded in getting him back
into competition

1530
01:33:48,680 --> 01:33:49,840
after all these years

1531
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:51,390
Of course I'm happy

1532
01:33:51,490 --> 01:33:53,010
Are you?

1533
01:33:53,090 --> 01:33:55,750
Of course who wouldn't
be with all this money?

1534
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:07,330
What's the matter? Are you questioning me?

1535
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:08,770
Dad

1536
01:34:09,570 --> 01:34:13,340
Mom's leaving, won't you make her stay?

1537
01:34:13,410 --> 01:34:16,070
Can I?

1538
01:34:16,410 --> 01:34:19,850
Remember to take care of yourself

1539
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:23,110
Don't open your eyes so big when you're lying

1540
01:34:23,220 --> 01:34:25,050
Don't act cool when you're cheating

1541
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:26,550
that will give you away

1542
01:34:29,590 --> 01:34:31,250
Aren't you mad at me?

1543
01:34:31,330 --> 01:34:33,920
Really?

1544
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,230
I just want you to be happy

1545
01:34:36,300 --> 01:34:39,060
You knew she was lying all along?

1546
01:34:42,300 --> 01:34:44,900
Why didn't you say so?

1547
01:34:48,110 --> 01:34:50,510
Because you would leave again if I did

1548
01:34:56,590 --> 01:34:58,020
Wait

1549
01:35:10,970 --> 01:35:11,930
Alright that's enough

1550
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,730
Look, Brother Fatt is not only God of Mahjong

1551
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:15,400
he's also Casablanca

1552
01:35:15,470 --> 01:35:16,230
We're not young anymore

1553
01:35:16,310 --> 01:35:18,500
We're here for the competition, cut the drama
will you?

1554
01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:21,110
Mind your own business

1555
01:35:22,210 --> 01:35:24,300
Come on, we're not young anymore

1556
01:35:25,580 --> 01:35:26,980
My beloved daughter

1557
01:35:28,120 --> 01:35:30,750
Mom has wronged you

1558
01:35:30,820 --> 01:35:33,310
The first time I lay my eyes on you

1559
01:35:36,860 --> 01:35:39,420
I knew you were the best thing

1560
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:40,930
to have ever happened to me

1561
01:35:41,900 --> 01:35:43,990
Can you forgive me?

1562
01:35:51,310 --> 01:35:54,170
- Can we proceed with
the game now? - Let's go

1563
01:35:56,810 --> 01:36:00,110
People think they need to be number one

1564
01:36:00,220 --> 01:36:03,550
What they really need is to be loved

1565
01:36:06,660 --> 01:36:08,650
Why isn't my father like that?

1566
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:16,760
Sorry, excuse me

1567
01:36:17,300 --> 01:36:19,200
- We're here - Ah Fatt

1568
01:36:19,270 --> 01:36:19,860
isn't that a good thing?

1569
01:36:19,970 --> 01:36:20,230
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

1570
01:36:20,370 --> 01:36:21,460
Dad, mom, people are watching

1571
01:36:21,540 --> 01:36:23,230
I can't bear to be apart from you

1572
01:36:23,370 --> 01:36:25,840
Dad, mom, let's play mahjong

1573
01:36:25,980 --> 01:36:27,340
- Yes - We have to be apart again

1574
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:28,500
I'll make this quick

1575
01:36:28,580 --> 01:36:29,670
You'd better,I can't bear for us to be apart

1576
01:36:29,780 --> 01:36:32,040
Be good

1577
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:35,810
Take care of him

1578
01:36:36,650 --> 01:36:38,520
So handsome

1579
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:43,020
Pak Chong Fatt, are you a man?

1580
01:36:43,130 --> 01:36:45,060
You're okay with your wife
treating you this way?

1581
01:36:45,190 --> 01:36:48,490
What do you know about love

1582
01:36:49,270 --> 01:36:51,320
Is there something wrong with your father?

1583
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:53,230
Let's play

1584
01:36:53,370 --> 01:36:55,560
And look at your wife

1585
01:36:55,700 --> 01:36:58,000
She just took my money

1586
01:36:58,110 --> 01:37:00,510
And now she's on your side cheering you on

1587
01:37:00,610 --> 01:37:02,100
So unprofessional

1588
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:04,240
No wonder you're married to each other

1589
01:37:07,950 --> 01:37:09,350
Shuffle the tiles

1590
01:37:15,160 --> 01:37:16,250

1591
01:37:16,630 --> 01:37:17,850

Three Bamboos

1594
01:37:26,900 --> 01:37:28,230
I'll take that

1595
01:37:31,070 --> 01:37:31,770
Eight Circles

1596
01:37:31,910 --> 01:37:33,370
- In-between - I'll take that

1597
01:37:33,480 --> 01:37:37,140
Flowerless, Concealed, Sequence Hand
win with a single Eight Circles, three points

1598
01:37:39,620 --> 01:37:40,740
This is mere luck

1599
01:37:40,850 --> 01:37:43,220
You won't be lucky everyday

1600
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:44,680
Whatever

1601
01:37:56,600 --> 01:37:58,230
- Nine Character - Pong

1602
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:01,130

1603
01:38:02,810 --> 01:38:04,930
- Two Circles - I'll take that

1604
01:38:10,650 --> 01:38:12,410
- Three Bamboos - Pong

1605
01:38:18,420 --> 01:38:20,410
- One Bamboo - Something to take again

1606
01:38:25,530 --> 01:38:26,990
Are you nuts?

1607
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:30,590
All these years you've
been the King of Mahjong

1608
01:38:30,700 --> 01:38:33,760
Your daughter has been unhappy

1609
01:38:33,870 --> 01:38:35,200
Are you happy?

1610
01:38:36,310 --> 01:38:39,970
One has polio, one s pea-brained

1611
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:41,540
Just play

1612
01:38:46,650 --> 01:38:48,620
- Eight Character - Pong

1613
01:38:51,220 --> 01:38:52,620
win

1614
01:38:57,860 --> 01:38:59,790
I am destined to win today

1615
01:38:59,900 --> 01:39:02,420
No matter whose side you're on

1616
01:39:13,810 --> 01:39:15,970
Do you still remember when we were young

1617
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:19,310
Master told us a story
about the wind and the sun?

1618
01:39:20,850 --> 01:39:22,010
He's been such a dumbass since young

1619
01:39:22,120 --> 01:39:23,210
Six Bamboos

1620
01:39:34,060 --> 01:39:35,090

1621
01:39:37,530 --> 01:39:38,970

Three Character

1623
01:39:42,270 --> 01:39:45,400
Dad, he has all the suits

1624
01:39:45,540 --> 01:39:47,670
I'm sure he's building The Thirteen Wonders

1625
01:39:47,780 --> 01:39:51,210
It won't be that easy

1626
01:39:56,120 --> 01:39:58,850
Why would Wong Tin Ba
build The Thirteen Wonders

1627
01:39:58,950 --> 01:40:01,890
The focus should be on the Green Dragon now

1628
01:40:03,490 --> 01:40:04,480
Seven Bamboos

1629
01:40:09,030 --> 01:40:10,230
Two Character

1630
01:40:14,040 --> 01:40:17,600
Everything is going so well

1631
01:41:18,070 --> 01:41:20,000
Pong

1632
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:22,700
Don't rush it

1633
01:41:22,810 --> 01:41:25,830
Everyone can tell I'm waiting
for the Green Dragon tile

1634
01:41:25,970 --> 01:41:28,940
Yet you discarded it?
Are you out of your mind?

1635
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:31,510
Because all you care
about s winning or losing

1636
01:41:39,320 --> 01:41:40,350
Green Dragon

1637
01:41:40,490 --> 01:41:42,290
I should thank you

1638
01:41:42,390 --> 01:41:45,620
Because of your ploy, I found my wife

1639
01:41:45,730 --> 01:41:48,200
And my daughter reunited with her mum

1640
01:41:48,330 --> 01:41:50,030
Brother

1641
01:41:50,170 --> 01:41:53,970
This Green Dragon is just a mahjong tile

1642
01:41:54,070 --> 01:41:56,060
I'll give it to you if you like

1643
01:41:58,210 --> 01:42:01,370
So we are really poles apart

1644
01:42:02,780 --> 01:42:06,480
It feels as though Pak Chong Fatt
is not a mere human being

1645
01:42:07,050 --> 01:42:08,350
He's like.

1646
01:42:08,480 --> 01:42:10,880
He is…

1647
01:42:11,020 --> 01:42:13,320
Right, that's him

1648
01:42:13,620 --> 01:42:16,990
Wukong, you want the Green Dragon tile?

1649
01:42:17,560 --> 01:42:19,690
I have it

1650
01:42:19,860 --> 01:42:23,060
It always gets in my way,
shall I give it to you?

1651
01:42:30,240 --> 01:42:31,230
Wukong

1652
01:42:31,370 --> 01:42:32,860
You're good at playing mahjong

1653
01:42:32,980 --> 01:42:36,570
But you have no integrity

1654
01:42:38,580 --> 01:42:40,240
You've won

1655
01:42:40,380 --> 01:42:41,910
Why don't you game?

1656
01:42:46,720 --> 01:42:47,980
Green Dragon

1657
01:42:49,390 --> 01:42:50,520
Game

1658
01:42:52,430 --> 01:42:53,860
The Thirteen Wonders

1659
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:56,500
Do you think we had more fun playing mahjong
when we were kids

1660
01:42:56,600 --> 01:42:58,570
Or now?

1661
01:42:58,670 --> 01:43:00,160
Playing mahjong

1662
01:43:00,270 --> 01:43:03,170
To me, playing mahjong is
about having a good time

1663
01:43:03,270 --> 01:43:04,670
Winning or losing is not important

1664
01:43:04,740 --> 01:43:07,570
I understand now, master

1665
01:43:07,710 --> 01:43:09,110
Understood

1666
01:43:13,720 --> 01:43:15,650
I'm hungry, let's go

1667
01:43:15,750 --> 01:43:18,380
- I want a roasted drumstick - Sure

1668
01:43:20,190 --> 01:43:23,280
The winner of the 12th World
King of Mahjong Championship is

1669
01:43:23,360 --> 01:43:27,290
None other than our boss, Wong Tin Ba

1670
01:43:37,770 --> 01:43:39,640
Who else could it be, other than our boss?

1671
01:43:39,780 --> 01:43:42,140
Come say it with me

1672
01:43:42,210 --> 01:43:44,440
Wong Tin Ba! Wong Tin Ba!

1673
01:43:44,550 --> 01:43:45,980
Cut the crap, let's go and have a feast

1674
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:48,070
Yeah, let's go

1675
01:43:52,150 --> 01:43:53,490
Hubby

1676
01:43:53,560 --> 01:43:55,080
What do you want now?

1677
01:43:55,160 --> 01:43:58,220
I feel very guilty, are you mad at me?

1678
01:43:58,530 --> 01:43:59,620
Let's not talk about this anymore

1679
01:43:59,730 --> 01:44:01,720
The most important thing is
for our family to stay together

1680
01:44:01,800 --> 01:44:05,130
That's right, you're the best

1681
01:44:05,200 --> 01:44:06,500
Pak Chong Fatt

1682
01:44:06,640 --> 01:44:07,620
What do you want?

1683
01:44:07,740 --> 01:44:09,290
I want to have a word with your father

1684
01:44:09,370 --> 01:44:12,000
If they don't sound right to you,
give me two slaps

1685
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:14,670
What do you want?

1686
01:44:16,280 --> 01:44:18,840
I have been very worried that

1687
01:44:18,950 --> 01:44:20,140
I won't win again after my luck runs out

1688
01:44:20,420 --> 01:44:22,510
But I understand today that

1689
01:44:22,650 --> 01:44:24,740
As long as I have you as a brother

1690
01:44:24,850 --> 01:44:27,150
It's hard for me to lose

1691
01:44:30,060 --> 01:44:33,550
I'm not the only one you have around you

1692
01:44:34,500 --> 01:44:36,460
Alright, bye

1693
01:44:39,200 --> 01:44:41,170
Hey

1694
01:44:43,940 --> 01:44:46,370
Are you two going to leave just like that?

1695
01:44:48,980 --> 01:44:51,710
I know I was wrong to curse you with polio

1696
01:44:51,850 --> 01:44:53,370
But you're my daughter and I'm your dad

1697
01:44:53,480 --> 01:44:55,070
we're family

1698
01:44:55,320 --> 01:44:56,410
Let's make up, shall we

1699
01:44:59,190 --> 01:45:00,710
I can even give up my
tit e of King of Mahjong

1700
01:45:01,860 --> 01:45:02,650
Sorry

1701
01:45:05,260 --> 01:45:07,820
I'm sorry

1702
01:45:12,870 --> 01:45:16,000
You can be so gentlemanly, Dad

1703
01:45:18,610 --> 01:45:20,770
How can you leave just like that

1704
01:45:20,910 --> 01:45:23,040
Don't forget you've killed Little Mosquito

1705
01:45:23,150 --> 01:45:24,340
I would be left alone if you leave

1706
01:45:24,450 --> 01:45:26,570
Our house would become so
cold like a big fridge

1707
01:45:26,650 --> 01:45:27,910
You want me to freeze to death?

1708
01:45:28,780 --> 01:45:30,120
Stay and continue to help me

1709
01:45:31,020 --> 01:45:31,540
Okay?

1710
01:45:33,460 --> 01:45:34,510
Thank you boss

1711
01:45:48,240 --> 01:45:51,030
- Green Dragon, hurry up - Sassy

1712
01:45:51,140 --> 01:45:52,400
Nine Circles

1713
01:45:56,780 --> 01:45:59,080
- Be careful - Hurry up

1714
01:45:59,210 --> 01:46:00,810
- Two Circles - Pong

1715
01:46:00,950 --> 01:46:02,470
You're so stupid

1716
01:46:03,290 --> 01:46:04,480
There's no fool in mahjong

1717
01:46:04,590 --> 01:46:05,780
what matters most is to be happy, right?

1718
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:07,580
- Don't scold him - One Circle

1719
01:46:07,990 --> 01:46:10,620
Why do the kitchens of these
rich people feel so hot?

1720
01:46:11,990 --> 01:46:15,220
Oh, that's because you are clinging onto me.
Food must be served on time during CNY

1721
01:46:15,330 --> 01:46:16,890
Didn't you say you like it
when I pretend to be a koala bear?

1722
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:18,190
Brother

1723
01:46:18,300 --> 01:46:20,170
This is the kitchen, not the bedroom

1724
01:46:20,300 --> 01:46:22,100
I asked you to cook rice,
not fry rice (make love)

1725
01:46:22,170 --> 01:46:24,430
It's been 20 over years, I can't help myself

1726
01:46:25,140 --> 01:46:25,900
Speaking of which

1727
01:46:26,010 --> 01:46:27,340
The Legendary Kungfu that Master taught you

1728
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:29,430
what was it for?

1729
01:46:30,280 --> 01:46:31,210
How did he know?

1730
01:46:31,310 --> 01:46:33,470
I think those vegetables have been overcooked

1731
01:46:33,620 --> 01:46:35,210
Boss

1732
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:36,840
You've got mail

1733
01:46:37,720 --> 01:46:38,480
Brother

1734
01:46:39,350 --> 01:46:41,910
- Seems like it's from master - Yes

1735
01:46:48,700 --> 01:46:51,430
Ah Fatt, Ah You, this is your master

1736
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:53,870
Excuse me, please come back

1737
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:55,660
Ah Fatt, Ah You, how have you two been

1738
01:46:55,800 --> 01:46:56,700
- Master - First of all, congratulations

1739
01:46:56,840 --> 01:46:58,500
I heard you're still the King of Mahjong

1740
01:46:58,640 --> 01:47:00,340
I'm so proud of you, and happy for you

1741
01:47:00,440 --> 01:47:03,310
But nothing beats knowing you two
are on good terms again

1742
01:47:03,410 --> 01:47:04,470
That is great news indeed

1743
01:47:04,610 --> 01:47:05,710
Master is doing really great over here

1744
01:47:05,850 --> 01:47:07,280
I have blondes as my disciples

1745
01:47:07,380 --> 01:47:10,150
Business is booming
and they all call me professor

1746
01:47:10,250 --> 01:47:12,120
Professor

1747
01:47:12,220 --> 01:47:14,350
America is a democratic country

1748
01:47:14,490 --> 01:47:15,820
They're all very open-minded

1749
01:47:15,920 --> 01:47:17,590
Your master practises the
Legendary Kungfu, right

1750
01:47:17,690 --> 01:47:18,950
Have you been practising the great condor?

1751
01:47:19,060 --> 01:47:20,690
I'm not going back anymore,
it's so much better here

1752
01:47:20,830 --> 01:47:22,460
Remember the "great condor", Ah Fatt

1753
01:47:22,530 --> 01:47:23,160
Ah "Fatt"?

1754
01:47:23,230 --> 01:47:24,890
Not this "Fatt", I meant that "Fatt"

1755
01:47:25,330 --> 01:47:26,730
Alright that's all, bye

1756
01:47:26,840 --> 01:47:29,070
Shut it down, bye

1757
01:47:29,170 --> 01:47:30,000
Your turn

1758
01:47:30,140 --> 01:47:32,040
- Let's snap some pictures - Stand here

1759
01:47:32,540 --> 01:47:34,010
This is for big brother

1760
01:47:34,110 --> 01:47:36,040
Come on, look this way

1761
01:47:46,860 --> 01:47:49,480
- Sorry, master - It's okay

1762
01:47:49,590 --> 01:47:52,030
Remember not to tell anyone
I'm practising the Legendary Kungfu

1763
01:47:52,090 --> 01:47:52,990
I won't

1764
01:47:53,090 --> 01:47:55,430
You're practising the Legendary Kungfu
for mahjong, right?

1765
01:47:55,560 --> 01:47:58,970
It is the Legendary Kungfu a right,
but not for mahjong

1766
01:47:59,070 --> 01:48:00,930
They're for the "condor"

1767
01:48:01,070 --> 01:48:02,830
Condor?

1768
01:48:02,940 --> 01:48:04,430
Mahjong players spend a lot of time seated

1769
01:48:04,540 --> 01:48:06,130
which is very bad for the prostate

1770
01:48:08,140 --> 01:48:09,540
I get it now

1771
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:15,510
Come here

1772
01:48:16,890 --> 01:48:18,010
Brother

1773
01:48:18,120 --> 01:48:20,020
You said after listening
to master's recording

1774
01:48:20,120 --> 01:48:21,380
You regained your confidence to play mahjong

1775
01:48:21,460 --> 01:48:23,450
Did master leave any message for me?

1776
01:48:25,130 --> 01:48:26,490
Yes or no?

1777
01:48:38,470 --> 01:48:41,100
If I press this button,
everything will be history

1778
01:48:41,240 --> 01:48:43,370
How does that make me different from a dog?

1779
01:48:47,620 --> 01:48:49,550
Quit horsing around Ah Fatt

1780
01:48:49,650 --> 01:48:50,680
You think no one knows

1781
01:48:50,790 --> 01:48:52,450
You listened to someone else's message

1782
01:48:53,190 --> 01:48:54,250
Mind your own business

1783
01:48:54,390 --> 01:48:56,650
Ah You won't be coming back to find me

1784
01:48:57,960 --> 01:48:59,220
Scared, aren't you

1785
01:49:00,160 --> 01:49:01,560
Screw you

1786
01:49:01,660 --> 01:49:04,220
How is playing mahjong a gambling addiction

1787
01:49:04,300 --> 01:49:07,860
It's a good form of entertainment

1788
01:49:08,170 --> 01:49:09,400
That's right

1789
01:49:09,470 --> 01:49:10,560
These people betrayed

1790
01:49:10,640 --> 01:49:13,730
the original intent of mahjong

1791
01:49:14,310 --> 01:49:17,510
They should be cursed for eternity

1792
01:49:17,650 --> 01:49:19,240
Punished for their atrocities

1793
01:49:19,350 --> 01:49:20,910
Give them 2 slaps everytime you see them

1794
01:49:21,020 --> 01:49:22,570
4 slaps when you see them the next time

1795
01:49:22,680 --> 01:49:24,280
6 slaps when you see them the third time

1796
01:49:24,350 --> 01:49:25,480
See…

1797
01:49:27,060 --> 01:49:28,450
Therefore

1798
01:49:28,690 --> 01:49:32,320
We have to pay mahjong
with the right attitude

1799
01:49:32,460 --> 01:49:34,190
Play it as a healthy form of entertainment

1800
01:49:34,330 --> 01:49:36,260
Play it to express your love
towards a cultural treasure

1801
01:49:36,360 --> 01:49:39,300
Gong Xi Fa Cai and Happy Lunar New Year

1802
01:49:39,430 --> 01:49:42,060
May you all be surrounded by happiness

1803
01:49:42,140 --> 01:49:43,800
May all your wishes come true

1804
01:49:43,870 --> 01:49:46,930
And you'll have everything
that your heart desires

1805
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:49,100
Gong Xi Gong X

1806
01:49:49,210 --> 01:49:53,440
Happy Lunar New Year to everyone

1807
01:49:59,890 --> 01:50:04,380
Let's get rich!
