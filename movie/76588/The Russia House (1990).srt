1
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,517
Yekaterina Orlova.
Katya?

2
00:01:55,645 --> 00:01:57,304
Never heard of her.

3
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:02,860
The patronymic's Borisovna.
Katya Borisovna Orlova.

4
00:02:02,986 --> 00:02:05,821
- Have a think, Barley.
- Don't know a Katya.

5
00:02:05,947 --> 00:02:08,189
Never screwed one,
never flirted with one,

6
00:02:08,324 --> 00:02:11,859
never proposed to one,
never even married one.

7
00:02:11,994 --> 00:02:14,912
What is she, the usual fat-arsed frump?

8
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:22,414
She visited the British Council's
audio fair in Moscow exactly a week ago.

9
00:02:22,547 --> 00:02:24,540
Audio fair?

10
00:02:24,674 --> 00:02:27,877
Cassettes.
Books of the bloody future.

11
00:02:28,011 --> 00:02:32,340
- So why didn't you go?
- I can go. I can not go.

12
00:02:32,473 --> 00:02:35,641
I'm my own man. But you wouldn't
know anything about that.

13
00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:41,012
Crap, Barley. You rented
a stand, booked your hotel, your flight...

14
00:02:41,149 --> 00:02:43,438
Why didn't you show up?

15
00:02:44,277 --> 00:02:48,441
I have a board.
I have family shareholders.

16
00:02:48,573 --> 00:02:53,450
The firm's having withdrawal pains at the
bank, if it's any of your bloody business.

17
00:02:53,579 --> 00:02:55,618
It is.

18
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:02,075
Tell me something.
Do you know Niki Landau?

19
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:06,916
Excuse me. Do you know
Mr Bartholomew Scott Blair?

20
00:03:07,051 --> 00:03:11,962
Yeah, I know Niki. Short-arse Polish
cockney sales rep. Goes at it like a rabbit.

21
00:03:12,097 --> 00:03:14,884
Barley? Sure, I know Barley.

22
00:03:15,017 --> 00:03:18,516
House of Abercrombie and Blair,
publishers, drunk or sober.

23
00:03:18,645 --> 00:03:20,602
A gent. One of the best.

24
00:03:20,731 --> 00:03:24,017
I must speak to Mr Scott Blair.
It is very urgent.

25
00:03:24,152 --> 00:03:25,812
He's not here, darling.

26
00:03:25,945 --> 00:03:28,400
But he was not here yesterday.

27
00:03:28,531 --> 00:03:33,987
Mr Scott Blair never came. He's absent.
AWOL. Not among those present. Sorry.

28
00:03:34,119 --> 00:03:37,655
Irritating little sod.
I'm quite fond of him really.

29
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:42,417
I have an important manuscript for him.
It is for Mr Blair. Only for Mr Blair.

30
00:03:42,545 --> 00:03:47,670
Listen, I'm trying to make a living here.
And not for Mr Blair, love him as I may.

31
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,798
Might one inquire
why she should ask Niki about you?

32
00:03:51,929 --> 00:03:54,884
I don't know. I don't know her.

33
00:03:55,016 --> 00:03:57,305
So you know Niki,
but not Katya?

34
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,092
Oh, now you're getting it, old boy.

35
00:04:03,483 --> 00:04:06,602
- Is that Scotch over there?
- Help yourself.

36
00:04:08,988 --> 00:04:11,028
Hold everything.

37
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:47,230
OK.

38
00:04:51,907 --> 00:04:54,943
You must be very kind and help me.

39
00:04:55,952 --> 00:05:00,496
A Russian friend of mine
has written an important novel.

40
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:04,076
Its message is important
for all of mankind.

41
00:05:04,211 --> 00:05:05,409
Nice.

42
00:05:05,546 --> 00:05:10,255
In spite of glasnost, my friend's
novel cannot yet be published...

43
00:05:12,719 --> 00:05:13,965
in the Soviet Union.

44
00:05:14,097 --> 00:05:19,091
Mr Scott Blair has undertaken
to publish it... with discretion.

45
00:05:19,227 --> 00:05:21,468
Don't worry. With Abercrombie and Blair,

46
00:05:21,604 --> 00:05:26,100
your friend's book is virtually guaranteed
to appear in total secrecy.

47
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:34,992
If you love peace, please,
take this to England to Mr Scott Blair.

48
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:39,824
- It is a gift of trust.
- It is better that you smile.

49
00:05:40,706 --> 00:05:42,746
- Excuse me?
- Smile.

50
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:46,660
This is Anglo-Soviet cultural exchange.
We smile, we exchange culture.

51
00:05:46,797 --> 00:05:50,212
Looking scared is something different.
Got it in there, have we?

52
00:05:50,342 --> 00:05:53,793
This is dangerous for you.
You must believe in what you are doing.

53
00:05:53,928 --> 00:05:56,170
Smile.

54
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,676
We smile, we kiss. Formal Russian kiss.

55
00:05:59,809 --> 00:06:01,848
That's right.

56
00:06:02,521 --> 00:06:08,559
Now we've done it. You have brought me
an official farewell gift from...

57
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:12,735
October Publishing
on the last day of the fair.

58
00:06:12,864 --> 00:06:17,858
And I have given you Shakespeare's
Sonnets for Careful Drivers.

59
00:06:20,414 --> 00:06:23,699
Would you... like
a nice dinner out somewhere?

60
00:06:25,544 --> 00:06:27,869
It is not convenient.

61
00:06:30,507 --> 00:06:32,749
Thank you.

62
00:06:32,884 --> 00:06:37,713
You can't think of any reason
why a book editor called Katya Orlova

63
00:06:37,848 --> 00:06:41,513
should risk her neck
to send you a manuscript?

64
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,276
Barley?

65
00:06:53,281 --> 00:06:56,815
Who said... "risk her neck"?

66
00:06:57,743 --> 00:06:59,783
I did.

67
00:07:01,956 --> 00:07:04,197
- Must be quite a book.
- It is.

68
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:07,537
- May I see it?
- Let's begin with the letter.

69
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:14,669
"Personal. For Mr Bartholomew
Scott Blair. Urgent."

70
00:07:14,802 --> 00:07:19,263
We'd like to find out why a woman
you don't know should send you a letter

71
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:23,803
beginning "My beloved Barley",
and sign herself "Your loving K".

72
00:07:23,937 --> 00:07:26,428
She's potty. Certifiable.

73
00:07:27,816 --> 00:07:29,773
Where is this manuscript?

74
00:07:29,901 --> 00:07:32,818
- That's none of your business.
- Like hell it isn't.

75
00:07:32,945 --> 00:07:35,021
She sent it to me as a publisher.

76
00:07:35,531 --> 00:07:39,909
- It's a bloody sight more mine than yours.
- Please calm down.

77
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,909
It's in safe hands, Barley.

78
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:47,365
The manuscript was in three notebooks.

79
00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:52,876
When Niki couldn't find you in London,
he had the sense to bring them to us.

80
00:07:54,509 --> 00:07:57,925
The first notebook is worthless,
scientifically speaking.

81
00:07:58,055 --> 00:07:58,885
Oh?

82
00:07:59,014 --> 00:08:03,177
Peacenik manifestos, slogans,
poems, quotations.

83
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:06,892
It has psychological interest, Minister,
in so far as the writer sounds...

84
00:08:07,022 --> 00:08:09,228
Absolutely barking.

85
00:08:09,357 --> 00:08:13,107
- Would you say?
- It's not a medical term, sir.

86
00:08:13,237 --> 00:08:15,194
Unstable, perhaps.

87
00:08:15,322 --> 00:08:18,773
- As for notebooks two and three?
- Genuine science.

88
00:08:18,992 --> 00:08:21,566
Written by someone in the business.
No question.

89
00:08:21,703 --> 00:08:23,032
The business?

90
00:08:23,163 --> 00:08:29,119
Destruction paths, payloads, aim points,
bias, rate of burn, trajectories, telemetry.

91
00:08:29,253 --> 00:08:32,871
Of course, it doesn't necessarily
describe the true state of affairs.

92
00:08:33,007 --> 00:08:35,213
What the hell does it purport to describe?

93
00:08:35,342 --> 00:08:40,384
In a nutshell, the Soviet's strategic
capability for waging nuclear war.

94
00:08:42,057 --> 00:08:44,810
And addressed to boozy Barley Blair.

95
00:08:45,478 --> 00:08:49,522
Well, if it's strategic, we can't
evaluate it without the Americans.

96
00:08:49,649 --> 00:08:52,140
So it's their baby, not ours.

97
00:08:53,277 --> 00:08:57,606
- Throw Scott Blair to the Americans.
- Unfortunately, we haven't found him yet.

98
00:09:16,092 --> 00:09:18,418
Eureka! We've got him.

99
00:09:19,387 --> 00:09:22,174
A Lisbon bank account, my dears!

100
00:09:22,849 --> 00:09:26,549
- We've got him.
- Lisbon.

101
00:09:28,229 --> 00:09:32,726
- Why did you run away?
- Run away? I own a flat here.

102
00:09:32,859 --> 00:09:35,860
Why Lisbon, Barley?

103
00:09:35,987 --> 00:09:38,194
Why Langley, Bob?

104
00:09:39,032 --> 00:09:40,941
You brought a woman?

105
00:09:41,076 --> 00:09:45,322
What's it to you if I brought a woman,
a man or a fuckin' Muscovy duck?

106
00:09:45,872 --> 00:09:49,242
What do you do with yourself
in Lisbon, Barley?

107
00:09:49,376 --> 00:09:52,377
Well, I was having a drink.

108
00:09:52,754 --> 00:09:55,080
Until I was interrupted.

109
00:10:01,596 --> 00:10:03,590
- Mr Blair?
- Eh?

110
00:10:03,724 --> 00:10:08,801
I believe I'm addressing Mr Bartholomew
Scott Blair. Yes? Correct?

111
00:10:08,938 --> 00:10:11,725
- Yes.
- I'm Merrydew. I'm from the embassy.

112
00:10:11,857 --> 00:10:16,020
We received a rather urgent
message for you over our link.

113
00:10:16,153 --> 00:10:18,940
Are you trying to tell me
someone's dead, old boy?

114
00:10:19,072 --> 00:10:22,193
No. That would be consular.
I'm commercial.

115
00:10:23,828 --> 00:10:27,327
Well, I never knew an honest debt
that couldn't wait till Monday.

116
00:10:27,456 --> 00:10:30,790
Loosen your girdle, Merrydew.
Have a drink with the unwashed.

117
00:10:30,918 --> 00:10:35,794
I say, Blair, the man's the Queen's
emissary, for Christ's sake.

118
00:10:48,602 --> 00:10:52,980
Have they moved the embassy, or are you
hijacking me? What's going on, tubby?

119
00:10:53,108 --> 00:10:56,642
- I'm commercial. Strictly commercial.
- Mr Blair, sir?

120
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:05,192
My name's Ned.

121
00:11:05,328 --> 00:11:07,700
I'm about to move the goal posts.

122
00:11:07,831 --> 00:11:13,252
There's no urgent message. There's no
crisis in your affairs - beyond the usual.

123
00:11:13,378 --> 00:11:15,536
I'm from British Intelligence.

124
00:11:15,672 --> 00:11:17,914
Come and meet the others.

125
00:11:21,844 --> 00:11:23,968
This is Clive. This is Walter.

126
00:11:24,098 --> 00:11:28,640
Over here is Bob, who is almost family.
Meet Barley, everyone.

127
00:11:28,769 --> 00:11:31,723
- Hello, Barley!
- Proud to know you, Barley.

128
00:11:31,855 --> 00:11:35,722
I'm the odd man out here. I work
for the Central Intelligence Agency,

129
00:11:35,859 --> 00:11:40,320
which, as you probably know, is based
in Langley in the state of Virginia.

130
00:11:40,447 --> 00:11:43,448
Let's have some fun. Let's do some good.

131
00:11:43,575 --> 00:11:45,734
Now isn't that jolly?

132
00:11:46,245 --> 00:11:50,788
So, where are we all off to?
Nicaragua? Chile? Iran?

133
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:53,620
Or are we just assassinating
some local nuisance?

134
00:11:53,752 --> 00:11:56,422
Don't rant. Sit down.

135
00:11:58,174 --> 00:12:01,922
Perhaps you can tell us
what this letter's all about.

136
00:12:17,443 --> 00:12:20,646
- Recognise the handwriting?
- Read it slowly.

137
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:23,270
Take all the time in the world, Barley.

138
00:12:25,034 --> 00:12:26,777
She's barmy.

139
00:12:30,665 --> 00:12:33,073
Who is she?

140
00:12:33,209 --> 00:12:36,210
Yekaterina Orlova. Katya?

141
00:12:38,089 --> 00:12:41,125
- Never heard of her.
- The patronymic's Borisovna.

142
00:12:41,258 --> 00:12:46,135
Katya Borisovna Orlova.
Have a think, Barley.

143
00:12:46,264 --> 00:12:48,802
I don't know a Katya. Never screwed one,

144
00:12:48,933 --> 00:12:53,311
never flirted with one, never proposed
to one, never even married one.

145
00:12:53,438 --> 00:12:56,474
What is she, the usual fat-arsed frump?

146
00:12:56,607 --> 00:13:00,820
So, she wrote you a letter
signed "Your loving K",

147
00:13:01,905 --> 00:13:06,697
- and you tell me you don't know her?
- I told you. I never met the hag.

148
00:13:06,826 --> 00:13:08,985
She's off her tree.

149
00:13:10,246 --> 00:13:12,488
She wasn't even there.

150
00:13:13,249 --> 00:13:16,285
- Where?
- At Peredelkino.

151
00:13:16,628 --> 00:13:19,001
It's a Soviet writers' village.

152
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:23,923
They value their writers. The ones
who behave get their own dachas.

153
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:27,133
I was lucky enough to be a guest.

154
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,970
When was this?

155
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,592
Three or four months ago.
One of my trips.

156
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:35,017
But there wasn't any Katya.

157
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:38,067
- What happened?
- I was brilliant.

158
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,861
- Yes?
- Oh, yes.

159
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:45,447
How to save the world between
lunch and dinner. I was flying.

160
00:13:46,074 --> 00:13:49,740
I believe in the new Russia.
You may not, but I do.

161
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:54,947
20 years ago, it was just a pipe dream.
Today, it's our only hope.

162
00:13:56,669 --> 00:14:01,580
We thought we could bankrupt you
by raising the stakes in the arms race.

163
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:03,791
Gambling with the fate of the human race.

164
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:07,509
Barley, you won your gamble.
Nuclear peace for 40 years.

165
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,430
Oh, rubbish. What peace?

166
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:14,017
Ask the Czechs, the Vietnamese,
the Koreans. Ask the Afghans.

167
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:18,688
No. If there is to be hope,
we must all betray our countries.

168
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:24,228
We have to save each other,
because all victims are equal.

169
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:27,234
And none is more equal than others.

170
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:31,819
It's everyone's duty to start the avalanche.

171
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,662
A heroic thought, Barley.

172
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:36,576
Listen, nowadays you have
to think like a hero

173
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:40,375
just to behave like
a merely decent human being.

174
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:47,259
And did you believe this nonsense?

175
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:50,637
I don't know. I believe it when I say it.

176
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:53,675
But you've got to be there.

177
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:59,938
You're taking a leak
in some filthy public urinal,

178
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:04,313
and the man in the next stall leans across
and asks you about God, or Kafka,

179
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:07,363
or freedom versus responsibility.

180
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:12,153
So you tell him. Because you know.
Because you're from the West.

181
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:17,749
And before you've finished shaking your
dick, you think "What a great country."

182
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:20,414
That's why I love them.

183
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:22,917
And they're very fond of me.

184
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:31,170
Anyway... later we talked about jazz,
and I played some.

185
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:34,677
What, somebody had a saxophone?

186
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:37,930
What else? Drum kit? Rhythm section?

187
00:16:20,398 --> 00:16:22,889
How many women were there?

188
00:16:23,818 --> 00:16:26,309
Three or four. But no Katya.

189
00:16:28,322 --> 00:16:31,324
But there was someone, wasn't there?

190
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:36,741
Yes. There was someone.

191
00:16:36,873 --> 00:16:39,957
Someone who is the reason
why we're all here. Yes?

192
00:16:40,168 --> 00:16:42,244
- A man or a woman?
- Name?

193
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:48,256
Christ. The way you people
come alive when you smell blood.

194
00:17:14,327 --> 00:17:16,783
They called him... Dante.

195
00:17:17,539 --> 00:17:19,367
As in "Inferno".

196
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,580
The others said he was on holiday.
A drinking holiday.

197
00:17:23,879 --> 00:17:26,417
He worked some place
where drinking wasn't on.

198
00:17:26,965 --> 00:17:29,041
Everyone deferred to him.

199
00:17:29,176 --> 00:17:32,841
He never spoke.
He just got drunk and stared.

200
00:17:33,263 --> 00:17:36,598
- Stared?
- Mm. At me.

201
00:17:37,685 --> 00:17:40,520
Did Dante arrive on his own
or with others?

202
00:17:41,355 --> 00:17:43,431
I don't know.

203
00:17:43,566 --> 00:17:45,605
Keep going.

204
00:17:46,694 --> 00:17:50,063
Then I decided to give them all
a rest from wonderful me,

205
00:17:50,198 --> 00:17:52,653
let them talk Russian for a while.

206
00:17:52,784 --> 00:17:56,034
There's a graveyard
a couple of hundred yards up the hill.

207
00:17:56,162 --> 00:17:58,569
It's a place of pilgrimage.

208
00:18:06,506 --> 00:18:10,883
"If there is to be hope,
we must all betray our countries."

209
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:13,336
Ah, Dante, old chum.

210
00:18:13,471 --> 00:18:16,092
Come to pay your respects
to old Boris, have you?

211
00:18:16,224 --> 00:18:18,263
Boris Pasternak.

212
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,930
Do you think he knows
people are allowed to read him again?

213
00:18:22,063 --> 00:18:26,524
"All victims are equal.
None is more equal than others."

214
00:18:26,651 --> 00:18:29,818
Yes, well... some write better than others.

215
00:18:29,946 --> 00:18:35,106
"How sweet it is to hate one's native land,
to desire its ruin,

216
00:18:35,243 --> 00:18:41,614
and in its ruin to discern
the dawn of universal rebirth."

217
00:18:42,084 --> 00:18:46,164
- Pasternak?
- No. Pecherin. An earlier poet.

218
00:18:47,589 --> 00:18:52,832
Pecherin understood that it's possible to
love your country while hating its system.

219
00:18:52,969 --> 00:18:55,010
If you say so.

220
00:18:56,515 --> 00:18:58,555
I love my country.

221
00:18:58,684 --> 00:19:01,471
I love it too - your country.

222
00:19:03,063 --> 00:19:05,471
And I'm reasonably fond of my own.

223
00:19:05,607 --> 00:19:10,484
To save it, perhaps
it's necessary to betray it. Yes?

224
00:19:10,613 --> 00:19:13,318
Because you and I, we love truth.

225
00:19:17,203 --> 00:19:19,242
Who are you, Dante?

226
00:19:19,872 --> 00:19:22,279
What do you do for a living?

227
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,535
I am a moral outcast.

228
00:19:26,671 --> 00:19:29,376
Oh, it's always nice to meet a writer.

229
00:19:30,258 --> 00:19:33,128
And what sort of rubbish
are you turning out now?

230
00:19:33,261 --> 00:19:35,300
Lies.

231
00:19:35,888 --> 00:19:37,928
I am the lie.

232
00:19:40,434 --> 00:19:41,762
Really?

233
00:19:46,274 --> 00:19:48,397
You spoke the truth.

234
00:19:48,526 --> 00:19:54,564
Promise me that you are not a spy, and
then I will make you a promise in return.

235
00:19:55,241 --> 00:19:58,776
I'm not a spy, actually. Not my line.

236
00:19:59,496 --> 00:20:02,616
You are nobody's spy? Not even ours?

237
00:20:04,751 --> 00:20:08,701
Dante, I'm getting a bit jumpy,
to be honest.

238
00:20:09,214 --> 00:20:11,502
I'm nobody's spy.

239
00:20:14,302 --> 00:20:17,921
Let's talk about something else.
How about chess?

240
00:20:18,056 --> 00:20:23,098
Oh, chess. In chess there are no lies.
But in my game lies are everything.

241
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,639
What game is that?

242
00:20:26,773 --> 00:20:30,224
The Soviet knight is dying
inside his armour.

243
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,353
You are in danger only from our lies.

244
00:20:32,488 --> 00:20:35,691
I commit the lie every day.
I lie even to my masters.

245
00:20:35,824 --> 00:20:41,411
So, promise me that if I ever find
the courage to think like a hero,

246
00:20:41,538 --> 00:20:45,915
then you will act like
a merely decent human being. Right?

247
00:20:47,253 --> 00:20:51,120
- Dante, leave me out, will you?
- Hey, you cannot reject me.

248
00:20:51,257 --> 00:20:53,629
Because I am strengthened
by your rejection.

249
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:56,001
So, promise me.

250
00:20:56,678 --> 00:21:00,047
What the hell am I promising,
for God's sake?

251
00:21:01,183 --> 00:21:03,223
Promise.

252
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,643
All right.

253
00:21:08,441 --> 00:21:10,896
If you ever manage to be a hero,

254
00:21:11,986 --> 00:21:15,319
I'll be a... decent human being.

255
00:21:15,572 --> 00:21:16,652
OK?

256
00:21:16,782 --> 00:21:18,359
Promise?

257
00:21:18,492 --> 00:21:20,532
I promise.

258
00:21:22,872 --> 00:21:27,285
Why didn't you come to us?! I know why.
You put your head in the sand.

259
00:21:27,418 --> 00:21:30,087
Don't know because don't want to know.

260
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:35,082
I'm sorry, but we're going to need
your rather serious help.

261
00:21:41,349 --> 00:21:45,299
Then I asked him "What am I supposed
to be promising, for God's sake?"

262
00:21:45,436 --> 00:21:49,185
Why didn't you come to us?! I know why.
You put your head in the sand.

263
00:21:49,315 --> 00:21:51,723
Don't know because don't want to know.

264
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:55,774
- Who the hell is that?
- Walter? He's a character.

265
00:21:55,906 --> 00:21:59,820
I'm sorry, but we're going to need
your rather serious help.

266
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:02,987
- That's it.
- And the notebooks?

267
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:06,454
The notebooks don't mesh
with any disinformation artist,

268
00:22:06,582 --> 00:22:09,501
con man or intelligence peddler we know.

269
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:13,079
Our psychology and handwriting gurus
tried to fault them.

270
00:22:13,215 --> 00:22:16,714
- And?
- They failed.

271
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:19,508
Try harder, Russell.

272
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:22,597
No.

273
00:22:23,516 --> 00:22:25,142
No.

274
00:22:26,186 --> 00:22:27,681
No.

275
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:29,936
Not even a perhaps or a maybe?

276
00:22:30,065 --> 00:22:34,976
No. Not even a tickle, old boy.
They're not in Dante's class.

277
00:22:35,695 --> 00:22:37,735
All right.

278
00:22:44,914 --> 00:22:46,657
Is that Katya?

279
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:49,910
- That's her.
- You remember her now?

280
00:22:56,509 --> 00:22:58,548
No such luck.

281
00:23:26,205 --> 00:23:28,163
Choose someone else.

282
00:23:28,291 --> 00:23:31,043
We didn't choose you. Dante did.

283
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,627
Because I wasn't a spy.

284
00:23:34,756 --> 00:23:38,338
We're not asking you to build
the beastly rockets or push the button.

285
00:23:38,468 --> 00:23:41,006
Only to help improve
our knowledge of the enemy.

286
00:23:41,137 --> 00:23:44,886
And if the enemy turns out to be a friend,
where's the harm?

287
00:23:45,017 --> 00:23:48,516
I thought we were all supposed
to be chums together now.

288
00:23:48,645 --> 00:23:50,554
Oh, my dear Lord!

289
00:23:50,689 --> 00:23:54,556
Because this year it suits them
to roll over and play nice doggie?

290
00:23:54,692 --> 00:23:57,859
Because this year they're
on the floor anyway? You ninny.

291
00:23:57,987 --> 00:24:00,610
All the more reason to spy
the daylights out of 'em.

292
00:24:00,741 --> 00:24:04,359
Kick 'em in the balls
every time they get to their knees.

293
00:24:04,494 --> 00:24:06,820
Well, that's where I disagree.

294
00:24:07,247 --> 00:24:10,414
I'll back my Russia against yours
any time.

295
00:24:11,793 --> 00:24:12,742
Nah.

296
00:24:12,877 --> 00:24:15,415
I'm sorry, Ned. No go.

297
00:24:48,456 --> 00:24:51,623
Bloody woman. I must've given offence.

298
00:24:54,086 --> 00:24:56,293
She has a point.

299
00:24:56,589 --> 00:24:58,914
Worry about Dante.

300
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:00,876
He reached out for you.

301
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:03,417
Would you rather
throw him to the Americans?

302
00:25:03,554 --> 00:25:05,962
Don't be fooled by Bob's Yaley manner.

303
00:25:06,099 --> 00:25:09,681
The Yanks will take Dante,
put him on a spit and have a barbecue.

304
00:25:09,811 --> 00:25:12,136
How will you live with yourself?

305
00:25:12,271 --> 00:25:14,560
I don't live with myself.

306
00:25:15,107 --> 00:25:17,645
In fact, I try to give myself a wide berth.

307
00:25:17,777 --> 00:25:21,478
I'm offering you a fresh start.
And a fat cheque.

308
00:25:22,407 --> 00:25:25,028
Never mind the money.
Barley's far too grand.

309
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,401
This is something people write in for.

310
00:25:27,537 --> 00:25:31,237
The chance to be an active player
in the defence of their country.

311
00:25:31,374 --> 00:25:34,458
You live in a free society.
You've no choice.

312
00:25:34,585 --> 00:25:38,833
Any decent church would've
burnt you bastards years ago.

313
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:45,842
You're a fool to use me.

314
00:25:48,516 --> 00:25:50,723
I let people down.

315
00:26:03,073 --> 00:26:04,781
Abercrombie and Blair.

316
00:26:04,908 --> 00:26:10,247
Is it the office of...
Mr Bartholomew Scott Blair?

317
00:26:10,373 --> 00:26:12,330
Yes. But he isn't in at the moment.

318
00:26:12,458 --> 00:26:14,949
Can I help, or would you
like to leave a message?

319
00:26:15,085 --> 00:26:18,122
No, thank you. It is a publishing matter.

320
00:26:18,255 --> 00:26:20,828
I will telephone again. Thank you.

321
00:26:24,553 --> 00:26:27,554
Crowds are good,
if you keep moving.

322
00:26:31,852 --> 00:26:34,224
Open spaces are good.

323
00:26:37,107 --> 00:26:40,310
Talking in the street is OK, if you have to.

324
00:26:40,444 --> 00:26:43,315
Never, never talk in a car
or in your hotel room,

325
00:26:43,448 --> 00:26:46,448
except for the benefit
of their microphones.

326
00:26:46,576 --> 00:26:52,448
If you've read anything about playing
the radio or running the taps, forget it.

327
00:26:52,581 --> 00:26:55,452
That's right. The source
is the star of the show.

328
00:26:55,584 --> 00:26:59,665
And the star decides
whether to make the meeting or abort.

329
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:03,625
This is fun. Is that why you keep it secret?

330
00:27:05,553 --> 00:27:07,925
Did you spot our watchers?

331
00:27:08,848 --> 00:27:12,383
The tramp raiding the dustbin,
the woman with the white shoes,

332
00:27:12,518 --> 00:27:15,473
and, of course, the man with the tracksuit.

333
00:27:15,605 --> 00:27:18,808
You scored nil. Out of a possible 12.

334
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:23,395
The lesson is
you'll never know who they are.

335
00:27:24,572 --> 00:27:30,279
If you need to write something down, use
a single sheet of paper on a hard surface.

336
00:27:30,788 --> 00:27:33,195
That leaves no impression.

337
00:27:34,374 --> 00:27:37,743
How many such surfaces
can you see in this room?

338
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,921
Well, including the windowsill... four.

339
00:27:42,465 --> 00:27:44,173
Seven.

340
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,590
This is often easiest.

341
00:27:48,472 --> 00:27:51,389
Then wipe it clean - rubbing hard.

342
00:27:52,392 --> 00:27:54,468
The issue is why.

343
00:27:55,062 --> 00:27:58,062
That's what you're looking for all the time.

344
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:01,025
If we trust the motive, we trust the man.

345
00:28:01,151 --> 00:28:03,394
Then we can trust the material.

346
00:28:03,863 --> 00:28:06,270
Why did Dante pick on Katya?

347
00:28:06,699 --> 00:28:09,237
Why does he put her life at risk?

348
00:28:09,368 --> 00:28:11,491
Why does she let him?

349
00:28:12,162 --> 00:28:13,870
Is she a spy?

350
00:28:13,997 --> 00:28:18,411
- It's voice-activated, sir. You switch...
- I know all this. I've had it up to here.

351
00:28:18,544 --> 00:28:21,118
I just want to get it done.
What's the hold-up?

352
00:28:21,797 --> 00:28:27,005
It's everything we ever wanted to know
about Russia and were afraid to ask.

353
00:28:27,136 --> 00:28:30,671
- Sounds like the pot of gold.
- Sounds like a crock of shit.

354
00:28:30,889 --> 00:28:34,758
Some unidentified walk-in is telling us
the Russians are way behind,

355
00:28:34,894 --> 00:28:38,014
they can't hurt us,
we can pull in our horns.

356
00:28:38,147 --> 00:28:41,765
Who the hell is gonna
sell that story on the Hill?

357
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:44,567
Russell?

358
00:28:44,695 --> 00:28:47,862
It could turn around
and bite us right in the ass.

359
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:50,114
Let the Brits run with it for a while.

360
00:28:50,243 --> 00:28:54,455
Dante is their source,
and, uh... Scott Blair is their problem.

361
00:28:54,581 --> 00:28:58,329
I'll go with that, Russell. But I want
Joe and Larry with him in London.

362
00:28:58,459 --> 00:29:00,369
Friendly observers, OK?

363
00:29:02,088 --> 00:29:04,377
You'll do us proud, Barley.

364
00:29:07,052 --> 00:29:09,258
I've brought you a present.

365
00:29:10,514 --> 00:29:13,218
It's not to keep. It's just to sniff.

366
00:29:18,938 --> 00:29:22,889
- Am I supposed to offer to publish it?
- Offer him anything he wants.

367
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:26,146
Say anything you need to say
to keep him with us.

368
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,568
Except the truth?

369
00:29:31,785 --> 00:29:34,110
Bon voyage, Barley.

370
00:29:34,871 --> 00:29:38,917
Come back with the goods on Dante,
starting with his real name,

371
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:42,162
and I'll get you a knighthood for literature.

372
00:29:45,549 --> 00:29:47,672
The Russia House.

373
00:30:04,401 --> 00:30:08,269
Barley Scott Blair.
Abercrombie and Blair?

374
00:30:08,655 --> 00:30:10,898
London. The publishers.

375
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:13,864
I believe you know Niki Landau.

376
00:30:13,995 --> 00:30:15,026
Yes.

377
00:30:15,163 --> 00:30:19,492
Well, Niki was very insistent that I should
give you a call. How do you do?

378
00:30:20,918 --> 00:30:22,661
How do you do?

379
00:30:22,795 --> 00:30:25,665
I'll tell you why I'm calling.
I'm here in Moscow.

380
00:30:25,798 --> 00:30:29,879
And Niki's sent you about a ton of tea.
Well, a couple of pounds.

381
00:30:30,011 --> 00:30:32,050
I hope you like tea.

382
00:30:32,513 --> 00:30:36,048
I was wondering
if we could arrange a handover.

383
00:30:36,184 --> 00:30:38,971
- A handover?
- Do you ever escape for lunch?

384
00:30:39,103 --> 00:30:41,345
Yes. Of course.

385
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,767
Well, how about today?
I'm at the Ukraine Hotel.

386
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:48,692
- That would be convenient.
- Good. Marvellous.

387
00:30:48,822 --> 00:30:51,147
Well, I'll be outside from 12.30 on.

388
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:54,734
- How will I know you?
- Oh, listen, I'm easy to recognise.

389
00:30:54,869 --> 00:30:59,081
I look like a large, unmade bed
with a shopping bag attached.

390
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:08,378
We're off.

391
00:31:32,992 --> 00:31:35,031
Hi. Hello.

392
00:31:36,287 --> 00:31:38,113
You're Katya, of course.

393
00:31:38,247 --> 00:31:41,366
Yes. And you must be Mr Barley.

394
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,666
Yes, indeed. The same. Well done.

395
00:31:45,796 --> 00:31:48,548
Well, er... where shall we go?

396
00:31:48,674 --> 00:31:51,759
I brought your stuff from Niki,
but I'll carry it.

397
00:31:51,886 --> 00:31:54,637
How did you recognise me, Mr Barley?

398
00:31:55,848 --> 00:32:00,225
Well, Niki said you were Russia's answer
to the Venus de Milo.

399
00:32:01,145 --> 00:32:03,268
That is ridiculous.

400
00:32:18,913 --> 00:32:21,950
I was nearly arrested here
three years ago.

401
00:32:22,584 --> 00:32:25,371
They said I was photographing
a military subject.

402
00:32:25,503 --> 00:32:29,121
- And were you?
- No. A soldier and his girlfriend.

403
00:32:29,257 --> 00:32:31,664
They asked me to take their picture.

404
00:32:42,604 --> 00:32:45,439
Obviously I received the manuscript.

405
00:32:48,568 --> 00:32:51,023
I will take you to where
we can have lunch.

406
00:32:51,155 --> 00:32:53,776
If you do not mind, I will first buy shoes.

407
00:32:53,907 --> 00:32:56,066
Shoes?

408
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,948
Today there is a shipment of shoes.

409
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:02,993
With perestroika, there is
even less available than before.

410
00:33:03,333 --> 00:33:07,711
- Really? I thought things were improving.
- Everything is corrupt and incompetent.

411
00:33:07,838 --> 00:33:11,207
Perhaps different people
are now stealing. I don't know.

412
00:33:11,342 --> 00:33:13,215
Keep your voice down.

413
00:33:13,343 --> 00:33:15,632
Complaining is our new human right.

414
00:33:15,762 --> 00:33:19,262
Glasnost gives everyone
the right to complain and accuse,

415
00:33:19,391 --> 00:33:21,763
but it doesn't make more shoes.

416
00:33:41,289 --> 00:33:44,408
Tell me about your new Russian book.

417
00:33:45,084 --> 00:33:47,160
Oh, yes. The book.

418
00:33:48,087 --> 00:33:52,547
Well, my problem is that, er,
I don't know the author's real name,

419
00:33:52,675 --> 00:33:55,879
let alone where he gets
all his information from.

420
00:33:56,012 --> 00:33:58,966
Learned his craft and so forth. Hm?

421
00:33:59,641 --> 00:34:02,178
Such personal questions
are not appropriate.

422
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:05,180
Some writers can only work in obscurity.

423
00:34:05,771 --> 00:34:07,978
But you know publishing, hm?

424
00:34:08,107 --> 00:34:12,521
If a fella's written about
the hill tribes of northern Burma,

425
00:34:12,654 --> 00:34:16,734
well, you're entitled to know if he's
ever been further south than Minsk.

426
00:34:16,866 --> 00:34:21,160
Especially if it's a really important book.
Which this one is.

427
00:34:21,829 --> 00:34:24,036
Dynamite, in fact.

428
00:34:24,791 --> 00:34:28,326
The author was inspired by certain
opinions of a British publisher

429
00:34:28,462 --> 00:34:30,834
concerning world peace.

430
00:34:31,673 --> 00:34:34,959
Do you think he'd like
to meet that publisher again?

431
00:34:35,802 --> 00:34:38,838
It is not known. This can be established.

432
00:34:38,972 --> 00:34:41,926
The publisher would like
to meet him again.

433
00:34:44,603 --> 00:34:47,520
How long are you staying in Moscow,
please, Mr Barley?

434
00:34:47,648 --> 00:34:50,648
Seven days... Mrs Katya.

435
00:35:18,346 --> 00:35:20,883
- Where do you live?
- With my children.

436
00:35:21,015 --> 00:35:23,553
Your children? How many?

437
00:35:23,684 --> 00:35:27,634
I have a boy and a girl.
They are eight and nine years old.

438
00:35:27,771 --> 00:35:29,811
It is not relevant.

439
00:35:30,774 --> 00:35:33,100
What does your husband do?

440
00:35:33,653 --> 00:35:35,562
It is not important.

441
00:35:35,696 --> 00:35:38,187
- Is he a publisher too?
- No.

442
00:35:38,324 --> 00:35:40,281
Is he a writer?

443
00:35:40,409 --> 00:35:41,488
No.

444
00:35:41,619 --> 00:35:43,907
A composer? A cook?

445
00:35:44,538 --> 00:35:47,243
Is he a dressmaker in Vladivostok?

446
00:35:47,875 --> 00:35:51,873
His factory prefabricates houses
for rural areas.

447
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:58,135
We are divorced.
Like everybody else in Moscow.

448
00:36:05,852 --> 00:36:09,268
Unfortunately, I have
to return to my children now.

449
00:36:09,397 --> 00:36:11,556
Isn't someone looking after them?

450
00:36:11,691 --> 00:36:14,775
Well, ring up. Tell them
you've met a fascinating man

451
00:36:14,903 --> 00:36:17,856
that wants to talk literature
to you all day.

452
00:36:17,989 --> 00:36:19,816
I'm sorry. I cannot.

453
00:36:19,949 --> 00:36:22,358
Oh, look, we've hardly met.

454
00:36:29,834 --> 00:36:31,412
I need time.

455
00:36:31,544 --> 00:36:35,589
I've got 10,000 enormously
serious things to discuss

456
00:36:35,715 --> 00:36:38,005
with a beautiful Russian woman.

457
00:36:38,635 --> 00:36:42,051
I don't bite, I don't lie...
Have dinner with me.

458
00:36:42,973 --> 00:36:46,757
- At least show me something of Moscow.
- It is not convenient.

459
00:36:46,893 --> 00:36:49,645
- Then give me your home number.
- It is not convenient.

460
00:36:49,771 --> 00:36:51,811
- Will you call me, then?
- Perhaps.

461
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:52,937
When?

462
00:36:53,067 --> 00:36:55,439
Perhaps I shall call you late tonight.

463
00:36:55,569 --> 00:36:57,526
No, not "perhaps".

464
00:36:57,655 --> 00:36:59,694
I shall call you.

465
00:37:12,253 --> 00:37:14,625
You forgot to give her the tea.

466
00:37:25,725 --> 00:37:28,181
- Mr Blair, sir?
- Wicklow.

467
00:37:29,437 --> 00:37:32,806
Excellent morning's work, sir.
No problems.

468
00:37:34,775 --> 00:37:40,730
Oh, by the way, you asked why so many
Russians use the word "convenient".

469
00:37:41,408 --> 00:37:45,737
In Russian it's "udobno".
But it also means "proper".

470
00:37:47,413 --> 00:37:50,663
- A bit confusing really.
- Yes, it is indeed.

471
00:38:05,682 --> 00:38:07,425
We have an interim, sir.

472
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:12,849
Katya left her office, took a taxi,
unknown destination. We have it covered.

473
00:38:25,076 --> 00:38:26,784
Da?

474
00:38:26,911 --> 00:38:28,489
Da, eta Alina.

475
00:38:30,749 --> 00:38:32,908
- Dobry dyen.
- Barley!

476
00:38:33,043 --> 00:38:35,451
- Welcome to Moscow, my dear chap!
- Alik.

477
00:38:35,587 --> 00:38:40,249
Why do you look so healthy? Why
have you no hangover? Are you in love?

478
00:38:40,801 --> 00:38:42,544
How did you know, Alik?

479
00:38:42,677 --> 00:38:46,593
Meet Leonard Carl Wicklow,
our new editor of Soviet books.

480
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:49,393
Alik Zapadny of VAAP,

481
00:38:49,518 --> 00:38:53,267
the all-suffocating
Soviet Copyright Agency.

482
00:38:54,106 --> 00:38:59,147
- How is Barley paying you, Mr Wicklow?
- Oh, Russia's top of the pops these days.

483
00:38:59,278 --> 00:39:02,612
Mention to the money boys
that we want to build up a Russian list

484
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,697
and they throw money at us.

485
00:39:04,826 --> 00:39:09,571
Have you a sales force, or are you
still relying on divine intervention?

486
00:39:09,705 --> 00:39:12,030
And how about translators?

487
00:39:12,166 --> 00:39:17,292
On fiction we will use our own
and take another 5% royalty. How's that?

488
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:21,710
- We'll consider it.
- No, I don't think so.

489
00:39:22,302 --> 00:39:24,508
We don't have the margin.

490
00:39:24,637 --> 00:39:26,677
Exactly.

491
00:39:27,181 --> 00:39:29,221
Well done, Wickers.

492
00:39:30,685 --> 00:39:34,185
- Jesus, Barley!
- Yuri.

493
00:39:34,314 --> 00:39:37,599
What are you doing here?
You're a month early for the book fair.

494
00:39:37,734 --> 00:39:42,063
Yuri, I want you to meet Len Wicklow,
our new Russian-speaking specialist.

495
00:39:42,196 --> 00:39:44,236
Hello. You a spy?

496
00:39:44,365 --> 00:39:47,485
- Only in my spare time, sir.
- Jesus, I like him.

497
00:39:47,618 --> 00:39:50,027
Oh, thank you. Sit down, friend.

498
00:39:51,581 --> 00:39:53,788
Let's deal direct, OK?

499
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,877
To hell with those assholes at VAAP.

500
00:39:59,214 --> 00:40:02,380
Stay away from them.
Especially Zapadny.

501
00:40:02,842 --> 00:40:04,716
I don't say he's KGB.

502
00:40:04,844 --> 00:40:08,925
All I say is he needed some damned good
friends to get him back into circulation.

503
00:40:09,057 --> 00:40:10,967
Know what I mean?

504
00:40:11,101 --> 00:40:13,259
- Cheers.
- Na zdorovye.

505
00:40:13,895 --> 00:40:17,098
Oh, Barley... I have something for you.

506
00:40:18,024 --> 00:40:22,770
Some of these writers haven't yet
been to jail. But I'm working on it.

507
00:40:22,905 --> 00:40:27,780
I'll make them famous in the West
even if it kills them.

508
00:40:34,291 --> 00:40:35,287
It's me.

509
00:40:35,876 --> 00:40:37,500
Do I disturb you?

510
00:40:38,087 --> 00:40:40,543
Deeply. Come over.

511
00:40:43,843 --> 00:40:48,220
You invited me to show you Moscow
tomorrow, I think.

512
00:40:49,098 --> 00:40:52,597
I did. Where do I send the glass coach?

513
00:40:53,685 --> 00:40:57,850
I have the tapes, and I've never heard
such pussyfooting around in my life!

514
00:40:57,982 --> 00:41:01,600
Barley has gotta tell Katya:
no more Greta fucking Garbo.

515
00:41:01,736 --> 00:41:04,108
And Dante better shit or get off the pot.

516
00:41:04,238 --> 00:41:06,729
I'm being pelted with crap
in the streets here!

517
00:41:06,866 --> 00:41:09,701
All right, Russell, message understood.

518
00:41:10,036 --> 00:41:11,614
Brock?

519
00:41:11,746 --> 00:41:14,913
Russell's metaphors are becoming
rather scatological.

520
00:41:15,041 --> 00:41:17,911
Signal Paddy at the embassy.
I want him to talk to Barley.

521
00:41:36,521 --> 00:41:38,560
Er, we're this way.

522
00:41:59,128 --> 00:42:01,416
I hope you like churches.

523
00:42:01,547 --> 00:42:05,129
In Russia we don't ask that.
It is not convenient.

524
00:42:05,259 --> 00:42:08,425
Ah. I think you mean "proper". No?

525
00:42:08,553 --> 00:42:10,593
- Proper?
- Mm.

526
00:42:10,972 --> 00:42:13,297
Nyet. Convenient.

527
00:42:23,444 --> 00:42:27,737
Now you know why hardly anyone
comes up here. Mind your head.

528
00:42:30,576 --> 00:42:32,699
One more to go. This way.

529
00:42:42,504 --> 00:42:44,711
This is just like school.

530
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:48,126
Dear old, bloody old... school.

531
00:42:54,725 --> 00:42:57,133
Who is that man down there?

532
00:42:57,269 --> 00:42:59,807
Oh, he's my editor. He's keeping lookout.

533
00:43:01,106 --> 00:43:03,515
Are we ready? Thank you, Brock.

534
00:43:08,156 --> 00:43:10,991
Why is an editor keeping a lookout?

535
00:43:11,117 --> 00:43:12,944
Well...

536
00:43:17,832 --> 00:43:19,742
Do you drink this stuff?

537
00:43:19,876 --> 00:43:21,536
No.

538
00:43:22,712 --> 00:43:24,752
Me neither.

539
00:43:28,468 --> 00:43:31,255
What's Dante's real name, huh?

540
00:43:33,389 --> 00:43:35,430
Who is he?

541
00:43:36,935 --> 00:43:38,975
Does he test things?

542
00:43:39,605 --> 00:43:42,808
Is he a physicist?
An engineer? Is he army?

543
00:43:45,235 --> 00:43:47,192
Does he like ice cream?

544
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,443
Does he like the movies?

545
00:43:50,073 --> 00:43:53,656
Is he one man? Is he two? Is he a group?

546
00:43:56,538 --> 00:43:59,907
Why don't you just start talking
and let's see how it goes?

547
00:44:00,042 --> 00:44:03,541
Come on, Katya. You started this, I didn't.

548
00:44:04,838 --> 00:44:10,213
Come on, it's me, Barley Blair.
I do jokes, I do bird noises, I drink.

549
00:44:11,637 --> 00:44:13,676
I'm a friend.

550
00:44:14,723 --> 00:44:18,591
- Who is he?
- I don't know what I may tell you.

551
00:44:20,646 --> 00:44:23,054
What did he tell you to tell me?

552
00:44:24,317 --> 00:44:27,104
Whatever is necessary.
That I should trust you.

553
00:44:27,236 --> 00:44:30,107
He was generous. It is his nature.

554
00:44:30,865 --> 00:44:34,483
Why did you send me the book
if you didn't trust me?

555
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:39,331
It was for him that I sent it.
I did not select you, he did.

556
00:44:41,167 --> 00:44:42,578
Oh.

557
00:44:45,546 --> 00:44:48,216
He is... my friend.

558
00:44:49,508 --> 00:44:52,130
Is this what you usually do for friends?

559
00:44:52,261 --> 00:44:55,013
Smuggle their manuscripts
out to the West?

560
00:44:55,139 --> 00:44:57,512
Risk your life, your children?

561
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,810
Does he understand the consequences?
Does he care?

562
00:45:01,938 --> 00:45:03,931
He is reconciled.

563
00:45:04,065 --> 00:45:06,734
- Are you?
- Of course.

564
00:45:06,859 --> 00:45:08,899
And your children?

565
00:45:10,196 --> 00:45:12,818
It is for them and their generation.

566
00:45:14,785 --> 00:45:17,620
He is inspired by the new openness here.

567
00:45:17,746 --> 00:45:20,949
But he knows that nothing
will change by itself.

568
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:23,784
- And you agree?
- Yes! And so do you!

569
00:45:23,918 --> 00:45:27,252
You spoke for him.
It is for you we are here!

570
00:45:31,176 --> 00:45:33,418
That's worth a drink.

571
00:45:44,356 --> 00:45:49,563
He is not a soldier.
He is a scientist. He is a physicist.

572
00:45:49,903 --> 00:45:53,521
- Also qualified in aspects of engineering.
- Better! Ha-ha!

573
00:45:53,657 --> 00:45:56,444
Engineering.
We're making progress, gentlemen.

574
00:45:57,494 --> 00:45:59,571
Where was he trained?

575
00:45:59,705 --> 00:46:01,497
He went to the LITMO.

576
00:46:01,624 --> 00:46:04,874
Afterwards to postgraduate studies
at the university.

577
00:46:05,002 --> 00:46:06,081
What's the LITMO?

578
00:46:06,504 --> 00:46:11,000
Leningrad Institute of Mechanical and
Optical Science! Write that down, fellas.

579
00:46:11,258 --> 00:46:15,421
LITMO is the Leningrad Institute
for Mechanical and Optical Science.

580
00:46:15,554 --> 00:46:20,632
He was extremely brilliant.
At 14 he won a mathematics olympiad.

581
00:46:20,768 --> 00:46:22,808
Mathematics.

582
00:46:23,646 --> 00:46:27,809
When I was at school,
they were the people I couldn't stand.

583
00:46:29,985 --> 00:46:34,482
Naturally, if you are not so intelligent,
you will be jealous.

584
00:46:49,089 --> 00:46:52,458
From university he went
to Academgorodok,

585
00:46:52,592 --> 00:46:55,261
the City of Science at Novosibirsk.

586
00:46:55,386 --> 00:46:58,886
He was... like a meteor there.

587
00:46:59,015 --> 00:47:01,138
Is that where you met him?

588
00:47:01,476 --> 00:47:03,136
No!

589
00:47:03,269 --> 00:47:07,398
In Leningrad. I was a child.
A great intellectual of 16.

590
00:47:07,524 --> 00:47:10,193
- I met Yakov at the club...
- Yakov?

591
00:47:11,236 --> 00:47:13,809
- Yakov is Dante?
- Yes. Yakov.

592
00:47:14,072 --> 00:47:17,239
- First name Yakov!
- Jacky.

593
00:47:17,492 --> 00:47:20,529
We met at the Club of Scientists.

594
00:47:20,663 --> 00:47:24,078
It was at a closed showing
of a foreign film.

595
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:27,707
It was by Godard.
À bout de souffle. Breathless.

596
00:47:27,836 --> 00:47:30,078
I went with my father.

597
00:47:33,383 --> 00:47:35,839
And what year are we talking about now?

598
00:47:35,969 --> 00:47:37,630
1968.

599
00:47:37,763 --> 00:47:40,135
You remember '68?

600
00:47:40,266 --> 00:47:44,133
The Paris students at the barricades,
American students against Vietnam,

601
00:47:44,269 --> 00:47:47,389
and for us it was Czechoslovakia.

602
00:47:52,110 --> 00:47:55,978
Yakov said that the Russians
would never stop

603
00:47:56,115 --> 00:47:58,986
the extraordinary reforms
happening there.

604
00:47:59,118 --> 00:48:01,525
It was the start of a new age.

605
00:48:02,204 --> 00:48:04,873
He had come back to Leningrad
to be a part of it.

606
00:48:04,999 --> 00:48:07,205
- From where?
- From the military.

607
00:48:07,793 --> 00:48:12,586
They had seduced him with privileges,
money for his researches...

608
00:48:13,174 --> 00:48:14,752
They had corrupted him.

609
00:48:14,884 --> 00:48:20,637
He had come back to Leningrad
to recover his innocence.

610
00:48:21,724 --> 00:48:23,763
He was beautiful.

611
00:48:23,893 --> 00:48:26,266
Not like a scientist, like an...

612
00:48:27,605 --> 00:48:29,645
artist.

613
00:48:32,026 --> 00:48:34,398
So you fell in love with him.

614
00:48:36,948 --> 00:48:39,521
He was my first lover.

615
00:48:57,219 --> 00:49:00,802
It was the same night
that the tanks entered Prague.

616
00:49:03,767 --> 00:49:06,518
There was no more innocence anywhere.

617
00:49:07,979 --> 00:49:11,099
Yakov said that innocence
was a delusion.

618
00:49:11,232 --> 00:49:14,898
And a few weeks later
he returned to the military.

619
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:19,281
I did not talk to him for many years.

620
00:49:19,408 --> 00:49:26,538
Until last year, when he met a British
publisher who spoke to his heart.

621
00:49:28,458 --> 00:49:30,915
Next day, Yakov telephoned me
at the office.

622
00:49:31,045 --> 00:49:36,205
He had decided what he must do.
He needed my help.

623
00:49:37,051 --> 00:49:41,048
Is he alone in this?
Does he need anyone else's help?

624
00:49:41,638 --> 00:49:43,263
No.

625
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:46,427
- None of his drinking friends?
- No.

626
00:49:47,186 --> 00:49:49,511
How can you be so certain?

627
00:49:51,274 --> 00:49:56,268
Because I am certain that
in his thoughts he is completely alone.

628
00:49:59,490 --> 00:50:01,697
Are you happy with him?

629
00:50:02,452 --> 00:50:05,903
- Please?
- I mean, er... do you like him?

630
00:50:06,039 --> 00:50:10,332
As well as loving him.
Does he make you laugh? Hm?

631
00:50:11,502 --> 00:50:14,503
I believe that Yakov
is a great and important man,

632
00:50:14,630 --> 00:50:21,298
who is trying to restore himself
and cannot survive without me.

633
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:25,678
Oh.

634
00:50:28,019 --> 00:50:31,103
Jesus Christ, Mother of God! It's Savelyev!

635
00:50:32,523 --> 00:50:35,608
Yakov Yefremovich Savelyev!

636
00:50:37,529 --> 00:50:41,906
Did he mention anything about, er...
falsification of results?

637
00:50:45,036 --> 00:50:51,241
He talks about "the great lie".
Everything is part of the great lie.

638
00:50:51,376 --> 00:50:53,084
Ah. Go on.

639
00:50:53,212 --> 00:50:56,047
Are you part of the great lie also, Barley?

640
00:50:56,173 --> 00:50:56,872
What?

641
00:50:57,007 --> 00:51:00,340
I think I am also allowed to ask questions.

642
00:51:01,219 --> 00:51:03,544
Oh, of course. Ask.

643
00:51:05,850 --> 00:51:08,387
Are you Mr Bartholomew Scott Blair?

644
00:51:08,519 --> 00:51:11,010
- Aw, for God's sake...
- Are you?

645
00:51:12,106 --> 00:51:14,347
- Yes.
- Are you a publisher?

646
00:51:16,944 --> 00:51:18,568
Yes.

647
00:51:19,446 --> 00:51:21,523
Are you a spy?

648
00:51:23,451 --> 00:51:25,111
No.

649
00:51:26,537 --> 00:51:30,120
Are you alone in this,
or were you sent by others?

650
00:51:34,878 --> 00:51:36,918
Answer her.

651
00:51:41,844 --> 00:51:43,718
I'm alone.

652
00:51:44,096 --> 00:51:46,468
Jesus! Fuck.

653
00:51:47,391 --> 00:51:49,965
I'm alone, and that's the God's truth.

654
00:51:55,358 --> 00:51:57,600
Never been more alone.

655
00:52:08,829 --> 00:52:13,373
Yakov said he will meet you in Leningrad
in four days from now.

656
00:52:13,501 --> 00:52:16,538
He has proposed three places
and three times.

657
00:52:16,671 --> 00:52:21,333
He will keep one of the appointments,
if he can.

658
00:52:23,678 --> 00:52:25,505
Good.

659
00:52:28,141 --> 00:52:30,846
Reconstruction. Openness.

660
00:52:31,311 --> 00:52:34,016
He's going to reconstruct
the balance of terror,

661
00:52:34,147 --> 00:52:37,646
and open the ultimate can of worms.

662
00:52:37,942 --> 00:52:42,605
Savelyev?! My God, if Dante is Savelyev,
you guys don't know what you've got!

663
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:45,231
Yes, we do. Trouble.

664
00:52:45,367 --> 00:52:48,451
Yakov Savelyev is
the right hand of God over there.

665
00:52:48,662 --> 00:52:52,956
And he says it's shit?
The Soviet threat's one big lie?

666
00:52:53,083 --> 00:52:54,577
And look at this.

667
00:52:54,709 --> 00:52:58,494
- They're bullshitting the Kremlin.
- Honour is due, Ned.

668
00:52:58,631 --> 00:53:01,418
Russell, I need your money.
And your love.

669
00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:05,417
I want an American partner for Barley.
I want him in Leningrad on Friday.

670
00:53:06,388 --> 00:53:09,140
I hear you, Ned. I'll get right back to you.

671
00:53:10,017 --> 00:53:14,893
If he says they can't hit Nevada on a clear
day, you better believe it. And be joyful.

672
00:53:15,022 --> 00:53:19,649
Joyful? Most of our customers
come to this town with contracts

673
00:53:19,777 --> 00:53:24,569
to bring peace and prosperity to
the arms industry for the next 50 years.

674
00:53:25,074 --> 00:53:27,197
But how the fuck
do you peddle an arms race

675
00:53:27,326 --> 00:53:30,612
when the only asshole you've got
to race against is yourself?

676
00:53:50,183 --> 00:53:52,222
The night train to Leningrad.

677
00:53:52,352 --> 00:53:57,594
I may have mentioned Mr Potomac Books,
my new American partner?

678
00:53:57,732 --> 00:54:01,860
Well, he's doing Leningrad,
and he summoned me for a powwow.

679
00:54:02,362 --> 00:54:05,149
- Powwow?
- I thought you knew English.

680
00:54:05,866 --> 00:54:08,107
"Powwow" is not English.

681
00:54:08,785 --> 00:54:11,572
- You must sit down.
- Sit down? Why?

682
00:54:11,704 --> 00:54:15,453
It is our custom before a long journey
first to sit down.

683
00:54:16,292 --> 00:54:18,535
Well, I'm lying down. Won't that do?

684
00:54:20,255 --> 00:54:25,297
Well... you are supposed
to sit on your luggage

685
00:54:25,427 --> 00:54:28,214
and sigh a little and cross yourself.

686
00:54:31,975 --> 00:54:34,014
Hold everything.

687
00:54:41,735 --> 00:54:43,360
OK.

688
00:54:46,031 --> 00:54:48,273
I was more comfortable lying down.

689
00:54:49,451 --> 00:54:51,740
Are you coming back to Moscow?

690
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:54,907
No, not this time.
I have to fly straight back to school.

691
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,665
School?

692
00:54:56,792 --> 00:55:00,161
Work. England.
It's a stupid expression of mine.

693
00:55:00,671 --> 00:55:02,829
I hope I didn't bore you last night.

694
00:55:02,965 --> 00:55:05,290
You did not bore me.

695
00:55:05,425 --> 00:55:07,752
Oh. Perhaps next time.

696
00:55:09,305 --> 00:55:12,425
I'll make a special journey
just to talk about myself.

697
00:55:13,601 --> 00:55:15,889
I wish you a good journey, Barley.

698
00:55:17,146 --> 00:55:18,426
I'll miss you.

699
00:56:45,027 --> 00:56:49,356
I want you to know something, Scott.
This little country is on the move.

700
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:51,317
I smell hope here.

701
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:53,941
I smell change. I smell commerce.

702
00:56:55,829 --> 00:57:00,159
And we are buying ourselves a piece of it.
I'm proud. Proud.

703
00:57:05,006 --> 00:57:07,461
0800 hours. Barley and Wicklow
are in Leningrad.

704
00:57:07,592 --> 00:57:09,667
Checked in at the Pribaltiyskaya Hotel.

705
00:57:10,302 --> 00:57:12,628
Good. We're on schedule.

706
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:15,469
Barley's got three chances
to make contact.

707
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:17,758
Now it's up to Dante.

708
00:58:05,734 --> 00:58:08,106
You want to sell me something?

709
00:58:09,488 --> 00:58:13,188
Cigarettes, Scotch, drugs, currency?

710
00:58:13,325 --> 00:58:15,483
No, thanks. Cheerio.

711
00:58:16,828 --> 00:58:18,785
You get lost?

712
00:58:18,914 --> 00:58:21,536
That's a good idea. Why don't you try it?

713
00:58:30,092 --> 00:58:31,634
One down, two to go.

714
00:58:50,904 --> 00:58:52,613
Where are you, Dante?

715
00:59:49,506 --> 00:59:53,254
Sir. Excuse me, sir,
but I think we are acquainted.

716
00:59:53,885 --> 00:59:57,884
Good God! The great Dante,
as I live and breathe!

717
00:59:58,682 --> 01:00:02,466
We met at that writer's party
at Peredelkino, remember?

718
01:00:02,603 --> 01:00:04,891
The only two sober people there.

719
01:00:05,731 --> 01:00:08,222
- How are you?
- I'm very well.

720
01:00:09,317 --> 01:00:11,275
Welcome to Leningrad.

721
01:00:11,403 --> 01:00:14,689
You can walk a little?
It is safest to keep moving.

722
01:00:14,824 --> 01:00:17,112
Yes, they told me that.

723
01:00:20,496 --> 01:00:23,912
Barley's made contact! He's done it.

724
01:00:24,666 --> 01:00:26,873
Unfortunately, he couldn't find me.

725
01:00:27,002 --> 01:00:32,293
So he gave it to our authorities.
People of... discretion. Experts.

726
01:00:33,718 --> 01:00:35,841
You have betrayed me.

727
01:00:36,387 --> 01:00:38,426
Nobody's betrayed you.

728
01:00:39,056 --> 01:00:42,888
I told you. Your manuscript
went astray, that's all.

729
01:00:44,311 --> 01:00:46,803
Our authorities admire your book.

730
01:00:47,649 --> 01:00:50,056
But they need to know if it's true.

731
01:00:51,194 --> 01:00:55,143
The best way would be
for you to talk with them.

732
01:00:55,323 --> 01:00:58,442
You came to tell me
you refuse to publish me?

733
01:00:58,576 --> 01:01:00,865
Dante, you're going too fast.

734
01:01:00,996 --> 01:01:02,988
Russia has no time.

735
01:01:03,123 --> 01:01:06,242
When the ice is thin,
you have to walk fast.

736
01:01:06,376 --> 01:01:08,701
To lose time is to lose everything.

737
01:01:08,837 --> 01:01:14,506
And then we all slide into the grave.
So be it. I will be the first corpse.

738
01:01:14,675 --> 01:01:17,084
And Katya second. What about her?

739
01:01:17,221 --> 01:01:19,260
She also chose.

740
01:01:20,348 --> 01:01:23,552
If we act together,
we will survive together.

741
01:01:24,185 --> 01:01:27,768
Have you forgotten
your words at Peredelkino?

742
01:01:30,191 --> 01:01:33,478
I am not the man you thought I was.

743
01:01:34,196 --> 01:01:38,657
You do not need to remind me that
man is not equal to his rhetoric.

744
01:01:38,784 --> 01:01:41,357
Our new people talk about openness.

745
01:01:42,913 --> 01:01:45,154
Disarmament. Peace.

746
01:01:48,251 --> 01:01:50,292
Words.

747
01:01:51,255 --> 01:01:53,924
You like graveyards, Barley?

748
01:01:54,633 --> 01:01:57,717
Look. Here is ours if we fail.

749
01:01:59,555 --> 01:02:02,390
Chose a monument.

750
01:02:16,739 --> 01:02:20,321
Leave Katya out.
Go with the experts and leave her out.

751
01:02:20,450 --> 01:02:24,663
I shall wish a book jacket that is only
letters. No sensational drawings. Yes?

752
01:02:24,789 --> 01:02:27,327
Send the money to a deserving cause.

753
01:02:27,458 --> 01:02:30,293
- Dante...
- What is the matter? Are you afraid?

754
01:02:30,419 --> 01:02:32,791
Well, of course I'm bloody afraid!

755
01:02:34,590 --> 01:02:37,960
Here... the Revolution started.

756
01:02:38,762 --> 01:02:44,467
Imagine this place on that day when
the battleship Aurora fired that blank shot

757
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:46,807
which signalled the Revolution.

758
01:02:48,187 --> 01:02:54,725
The next revolution shall begin with a few
gentle phrases of Johann Sebastian Bach.

759
01:02:56,071 --> 01:03:01,776
Or maybe with some of the jazz
you play so beautifully.

760
01:03:03,494 --> 01:03:06,531
Yes, a little Sidney Bechet.

761
01:03:07,665 --> 01:03:09,373
It's time.

762
01:03:19,469 --> 01:03:21,508
Da?

763
01:03:28,771 --> 01:03:31,522
Got a present for you.
They asked me to give it to you.

764
01:03:31,648 --> 01:03:34,649
It tells you how to get in touch with them.
I'll try to...

765
01:03:34,776 --> 01:03:38,394
Have you learned nothing?
They are against you, and against me.

766
01:03:38,530 --> 01:03:40,902
Those are not the decent people.

767
01:03:41,032 --> 01:03:45,327
How the hell do you know
who the decent people are any more?

768
01:03:45,454 --> 01:03:48,953
Come to England. Then you can
tell the world everything you want.

769
01:03:49,083 --> 01:03:51,787
You are wearing grey today, Barley.

770
01:03:53,670 --> 01:03:56,588
My father was sent to prison by grey men.

771
01:03:57,466 --> 01:04:02,342
He was murdered by men
who wore grey uniforms.

772
01:04:03,973 --> 01:04:09,643
Grey men ruined my beautiful profession,
and take care, or they will ruin you too.

773
01:04:14,901 --> 01:04:16,858
Will you publish me?

774
01:04:16,986 --> 01:04:21,565
Or must I start again for my search
for a decent human being?

775
01:04:23,326 --> 01:04:25,199
No.

776
01:04:25,328 --> 01:04:27,367
I'm with you.

777
01:04:28,122 --> 01:04:30,411
I believe you're right.

778
01:04:38,925 --> 01:04:41,879
I dropped another notebook into your bag.

779
01:04:43,763 --> 01:04:46,171
Throw your friends a few bones.

780
01:04:49,311 --> 01:04:51,434
Publish me.

781
01:05:29,976 --> 01:05:32,349
Barley. Welcome back.

782
01:05:32,479 --> 01:05:34,935
Nedski. Why aren't you working?

783
01:05:35,441 --> 01:05:39,273
I'm the red carpet.
And the bunting, and the brass band.

784
01:05:40,070 --> 01:05:42,359
Oh. You got the notebook.

785
01:05:43,115 --> 01:05:47,943
- Good stuff, was it?
- The best. You're the hero of the hour.

786
01:05:48,078 --> 01:05:50,118
You're a star.

787
01:05:50,623 --> 01:05:53,707
Where's Walter? Off with the boy scouts?

788
01:05:53,835 --> 01:05:57,702
Well, he's off the job, I'm afraid.
But he sends his love.

789
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:05,630
The fourth notebook
is a deal-breaker.

790
01:06:06,514 --> 01:06:11,639
It's come-to-Jesus time for both sides
now, the hawks and the doves.

791
01:06:13,688 --> 01:06:17,222
The Agency has gotta
get off the fence, Russell.

792
01:06:58,942 --> 01:07:02,192
Only three weeks old,
and already a classic.

793
01:07:04,281 --> 01:07:07,365
Feel the weight of all the expert opinions.

794
01:07:09,744 --> 01:07:13,743
- Is there a conclusion?
- Clive, there is a conclusion.

795
01:07:14,875 --> 01:07:18,209
Drop it down the toilet,
and your guy with it.

796
01:07:23,133 --> 01:07:24,960
Ned?

797
01:07:30,308 --> 01:07:33,676
- Is that what you think, Russell?
- What I think?

798
01:07:33,811 --> 01:07:38,936
Well, expert opinion has it that
this notebook was written very quickly,

799
01:07:39,066 --> 01:07:43,278
or very slowly, by a man or a woman,
in anger or in jest.

800
01:07:43,404 --> 01:07:47,900
The writer was right- or left-handed.
He was a scientist and a non-scientist.

801
01:07:48,034 --> 01:07:50,073
What I think?

802
01:07:50,661 --> 01:07:53,662
For experts, there's no toilet deep enough.

803
01:07:56,167 --> 01:07:57,791
Good for you, Russell.

804
01:07:57,918 --> 01:08:02,213
The trouble is,
a lot of highly paid favourite sons

805
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:05,709
are in danger of having their
rice bowls broken and going hungry,

806
01:08:05,843 --> 01:08:08,963
all on account
of these goddamn notebooks.

807
01:08:10,890 --> 01:08:15,766
The Russian military effort is stalled,
the American military effort is stalled.

808
01:08:15,896 --> 01:08:20,854
Their rocket motors suck instead of blow,
their ICBMs can't get out of their kennels,

809
01:08:20,984 --> 01:08:24,483
their scientists can't do
solid fuel for shit...

810
01:08:24,988 --> 01:08:27,823
Our customers don't like to hear that.

811
01:08:31,286 --> 01:08:35,366
Jesus Christ. I have to come
all this way to tell you this?

812
01:08:39,628 --> 01:08:41,869
And yet here you are.

813
01:08:43,006 --> 01:08:45,164
And yet here I am.

814
01:08:46,134 --> 01:08:48,673
Clive, Ned, I'll tell you something.

815
01:08:49,096 --> 01:08:51,931
I am an honest-to-God glasnostic.

816
01:08:52,724 --> 01:08:57,719
I was born a glasnostic. My parents
are old glasnostics from way back.

817
01:08:58,647 --> 01:09:02,098
My children will be raised as glasnostics -
although I don't have any.

818
01:09:02,234 --> 01:09:07,691
And I really believe that Dante
is a source from glasnost heaven.

819
01:09:10,117 --> 01:09:14,115
I can't look away. He'll invade my sleep.

820
01:09:15,247 --> 01:09:18,912
And for the rest of my fucking life
I'll be hearing him say

821
01:09:19,042 --> 01:09:23,622
"Russell, you had it in your hand.
Ned gave it to you."

822
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:29,634
Honour is due, Ned.

823
01:09:35,602 --> 01:09:38,519
- You won't regret it, Russell.
- You might.

824
01:09:39,814 --> 01:09:41,890
We wanna meet your Mr Barley.

825
01:09:42,024 --> 01:09:45,689
In the back room,
with the lights in his eyes.

826
01:10:06,465 --> 01:10:10,546
Mr Blair,
you have all the attributes.

827
01:10:10,679 --> 01:10:13,929
Generosity, wit, courtesy,

828
01:10:14,683 --> 01:10:18,727
sang-froid, saxophone and reckless folly.

829
01:10:19,729 --> 01:10:24,059
So... what in the hell takes you
to Russia every five minutes?

830
01:10:24,985 --> 01:10:28,069
Are you, uh... buying property over there?

831
01:10:29,990 --> 01:10:31,484
That's a fair question.

832
01:10:31,616 --> 01:10:35,531
Fuck whether it's a fair question.
Just tell us the answer.

833
01:10:38,039 --> 01:10:40,080
I love the place.

834
01:10:40,209 --> 01:10:42,248
It draws me.

835
01:10:45,339 --> 01:10:47,378
It's such a shambles.

836
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:51,254
They try so hard, from so far back...

837
01:10:52,095 --> 01:10:55,049
Poor buggers.
They just want to be like us.

838
01:10:57,310 --> 01:11:01,971
They have this huge heart
and... huge ignorance.

839
01:11:03,732 --> 01:11:05,974
And they always keep their word.

840
01:11:06,110 --> 01:11:08,398
Ugh... Acorns!

841
01:11:09,238 --> 01:11:12,323
They're gathering acorns
and making coffee from them!

842
01:11:12,450 --> 01:11:14,277
That's what they're doing here.

843
01:11:14,410 --> 01:11:19,831
Mr Blair, we are buying a Picasso. OK?

844
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,751
You don't mind
an occasional metaphor, do you?

845
01:11:23,878 --> 01:11:26,084
- Not at all.
- Good.

846
01:11:26,547 --> 01:11:30,925
Some people don't like my metaphors.
I don't know why, but...

847
01:11:31,052 --> 01:11:35,381
Anyway, everyone in this room
is buying the same Picasso.

848
01:11:36,057 --> 01:11:40,849
It's, uh, very rare.
Medium rare, well done. What the fuck?

849
01:11:40,978 --> 01:11:44,514
The bottom-line question is
"Did Picasso paint it?"

850
01:11:45,442 --> 01:11:48,526
And you're the man who is selling it to us.

851
01:11:49,195 --> 01:11:51,603
It is not my Picasso, Russell.

852
01:11:52,532 --> 01:11:56,660
It is not my Picasso.
And I'm not saying it is a Picasso.

853
01:11:57,245 --> 01:12:00,115
And furthermore, I'm not selling it to you.

854
01:12:00,916 --> 01:12:05,328
And lastly, I don't give a fuck
whether you buy it or not.

855
01:12:16,557 --> 01:12:21,053
Quinn is army from the anus up.
He likes plain answers.

856
01:12:23,021 --> 01:12:25,346
I'll tell Barley.

857
01:12:27,484 --> 01:12:31,268
Have you ever had any homosexual
experiences, Mr Blair?

858
01:12:32,155 --> 01:12:35,240
Just the usual adolescent hand-held job.

859
01:12:36,327 --> 01:12:38,734
Same as yourself, I suppose?

860
01:12:40,122 --> 01:12:43,039
- Has this man been fluttered?
- What's that?

861
01:12:43,166 --> 01:12:46,251
Lie detector. No, Colonel, he hasn't.

862
01:12:48,798 --> 01:12:51,503
Your background is fairly liberal,
isn't it, Mr Blair?

863
01:12:51,634 --> 01:12:54,207
- Background?
- Your father.

864
01:12:54,345 --> 01:12:59,090
No. My father hated liberals.
He took the communist line mainly.

865
01:13:00,642 --> 01:13:02,884
Your father died eight years ago?

866
01:13:03,020 --> 01:13:03,969
Yes.

867
01:13:04,104 --> 01:13:08,185
Which is about the time your visits
to the Soviet Union became pretty regular.

868
01:13:08,317 --> 01:13:12,185
- I hadn't made the connection.
- Have you formed any connection

869
01:13:12,321 --> 01:13:17,197
with any peaceniks, dissidents
or other unofficial groups of that nature?

870
01:13:18,244 --> 01:13:21,910
You meet all sorts.
Jazz people, book people...

871
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:25,243
That's an impossible question. I'm sorry.

872
01:13:25,793 --> 01:13:30,087
Well, let me turn that around and ask if
you've made any connection, whatsoever,

873
01:13:30,214 --> 01:13:32,207
with any peace people in England?

874
01:13:32,341 --> 01:13:36,588
Oh, hundreds, I should think.
You have to stay indoors to avoid them.

875
01:13:36,721 --> 01:13:39,094
Are there any musicians
you fraternise with

876
01:13:39,224 --> 01:13:44,349
whom you would describe, or who would
describe themselves, as anarchists?

877
01:13:47,106 --> 01:13:49,562
Ah. There was a trombone player.

878
01:13:51,611 --> 01:13:54,103
Wilfred Baker was his name.

879
01:13:54,573 --> 01:13:56,898
He's the only jazz musician I can recall

880
01:13:57,034 --> 01:14:00,782
who was completely devoid
of anarchist tendencies.

881
01:14:04,207 --> 01:14:07,790
Do you disapprove of the English
social structure, Mr Blair?

882
01:14:08,127 --> 01:14:11,747
Absolutely. Give me America every time.

883
01:14:12,132 --> 01:14:14,339
- Thank you, Mr Blair.
- Not at all.

884
01:14:14,468 --> 01:14:18,216
But you seem to go to Russia
rather more than you come to America.

885
01:14:18,347 --> 01:14:21,134
Yes. Because I prefer Russia.

886
01:14:22,684 --> 01:14:27,928
It's as corrupt as America, but...
there's less bullshit.

887
01:14:32,653 --> 01:14:37,860
He acted like a man who's going
his own way. Wouldn't you say?

888
01:14:40,494 --> 01:14:44,824
I'd say he behaved like someone
who didn't need to be careful.

889
01:14:45,833 --> 01:14:47,873
He might have.

890
01:14:48,669 --> 01:14:52,963
Oh, René. Mr Blair likes to have
a bottle of Scotch in his room.

891
01:14:54,341 --> 01:14:56,417
After his cricket.

892
01:14:58,972 --> 01:15:01,213
- Very good.
- That was nearly a six.

893
01:15:01,641 --> 01:15:02,969
Mr Brady, Barley.

894
01:15:03,101 --> 01:15:06,304
Looks like you've done
a fine thing, Barley.

895
01:15:06,437 --> 01:15:09,224
Anybody say thank you along the way?

896
01:15:09,357 --> 01:15:10,934
No.

897
01:15:11,066 --> 01:15:15,017
Did I read somewhere you once played
in the great Ray Noble's band?

898
01:15:15,155 --> 01:15:17,906
Ah. A beardless boy in those days, Brady.

899
01:15:18,575 --> 01:15:20,733
Wasn't Ray the sweetest man
you ever met?

900
01:15:20,869 --> 01:15:22,612
Ray was a prince.

901
01:15:22,745 --> 01:15:25,117
Did you ever play chess with him?

902
01:15:25,706 --> 01:15:28,826
- As a matter of fact, I did.
- Who won?

903
01:15:29,586 --> 01:15:32,042
- I did.
- So did I.

904
01:15:41,890 --> 01:15:46,885
Close your eyes, please.
No undue excitation of any kind.

905
01:15:47,020 --> 01:15:48,894
Always answer truthfully.

906
01:15:59,324 --> 01:16:01,946
Answers to be "yes" or "no" only.

907
01:16:02,077 --> 01:16:04,117
Merv.

908
01:16:04,663 --> 01:16:06,703
Is your name Blair?

909
01:16:07,082 --> 01:16:09,205
Scott Blair.

910
01:16:09,334 --> 01:16:12,750
- Is your name Scott Blair?
- Yes.

911
01:16:19,553 --> 01:16:20,549
No.

912
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:23,005
- I am being blackmailed.
- No.

913
01:16:23,140 --> 01:16:25,429
I am being coerced.

914
01:16:25,559 --> 01:16:26,757
Yes.

915
01:16:26,894 --> 01:16:28,767
By the Soviets?

916
01:16:28,896 --> 01:16:29,975
No.

917
01:16:34,277 --> 01:16:38,226
I am operating in collusion
with the woman Katya Orlova.

918
01:16:38,364 --> 01:16:39,906
No.

919
01:16:40,032 --> 01:16:42,108
Yes. What do you mean?

920
01:16:42,243 --> 01:16:44,698
- Hold it.
- Don't break the rhythm, Mr Blair.

921
01:16:44,829 --> 01:16:49,206
We have people do that on purpose
just to shake off a bad question.

922
01:16:49,333 --> 01:16:52,418
I am operating on behalf
of the Soviet Union.

923
01:16:52,545 --> 01:16:55,629
- No.
- In collusion with Katya Orlova.

924
01:16:55,757 --> 01:16:58,793
- No.
- I am the lover of Katya Orlova.

925
01:16:59,719 --> 01:17:00,465
No.

926
01:17:00,595 --> 01:17:04,046
I am motivated
by my love for Katya Orlova.

927
01:17:04,598 --> 01:17:06,343
No.

928
01:17:12,774 --> 01:17:14,813
Get rid of him, Clive.

929
01:17:16,277 --> 01:17:20,489
He's wrong for us.
Put in a professional. One of our people.

930
01:17:21,115 --> 01:17:24,734
If Dante's a good boy,
he gets the jackpot. I'll see to it.

931
01:17:24,870 --> 01:17:28,369
A million's no problem.
Ten million's even better.

932
01:17:28,498 --> 01:17:31,867
That way Dante's a traitor
our patriots can understand.

933
01:17:32,002 --> 01:17:36,794
Dante won't deal with a professional.
He won't be bribed or threatened.

934
01:17:36,923 --> 01:17:39,925
He's straight. Do you remember straight?

935
01:17:40,594 --> 01:17:43,963
Nobody hired us
for our brotherly love, Ned.

936
01:17:49,644 --> 01:17:51,684
Russell.

937
01:17:55,276 --> 01:17:57,683
- Brady?
- Clive?

938
01:17:59,113 --> 01:18:01,189
Is there a seat on your plane?

939
01:18:01,323 --> 01:18:03,363
Of course.

940
01:18:23,429 --> 01:18:25,468
Barley?

941
01:18:27,350 --> 01:18:29,389
Barley?

942
01:18:31,521 --> 01:18:33,560
You've won!

943
01:18:36,609 --> 01:18:39,147
You've beaten their whole apparatus.

944
01:18:39,737 --> 01:18:41,943
There'll be no turning back now.

945
01:18:42,281 --> 01:18:45,532
Well done, Ned Jolly good show.

946
01:18:47,245 --> 01:18:52,487
Well, that's what you want, isn't it?
To go back to Moscow. To see it through.

947
01:18:54,877 --> 01:18:57,119
Three cheers for our side.

948
01:19:04,679 --> 01:19:08,214
Blair stays, and Langley
are taking over the case.

949
01:19:08,349 --> 01:19:11,019
They're preparing
a shopping list for Dante.

950
01:19:11,144 --> 01:19:15,142
It'll be the list to end all lists.
A grand-slam questionnaire.

951
01:19:15,274 --> 01:19:18,559
Pentagon, Defense, State...
Endorsed by the president.

952
01:19:18,694 --> 01:19:21,267
You made them a present of my joe?

953
01:19:21,822 --> 01:19:25,605
The role of the Russia House
will be respected. Russell values the link.

954
01:19:25,742 --> 01:19:29,407
We're taking over Barley's resettlement
and his pension, Ned.

955
01:19:29,537 --> 01:19:31,994
You gave away my joe for his pension?

956
01:19:32,124 --> 01:19:34,829
We're on the same bloody side,
aren't we?

957
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:39,254
God, this is a list of questions that could
unlock all the Sov military secrets

958
01:19:39,381 --> 01:19:41,457
and win the arms race at a stroke!

959
01:19:41,591 --> 01:19:45,126
Or lose it. I don't like lists, Clive.

960
01:19:45,512 --> 01:19:48,430
Lists tell you too much
about the people who make them.

961
01:19:48,557 --> 01:19:51,760
I think you'll enjoy our facility.

962
01:19:51,894 --> 01:19:54,930
Bloody marvellous.
Blair's tapes encrypted,

963
01:19:55,064 --> 01:19:59,476
bounced by satellite to London,
then decrypted - all in minutes.

964
01:20:12,164 --> 01:20:14,620
Ah, Vladimir.

965
01:20:14,750 --> 01:20:18,368
You know my partner, JP Henziger?
No, you don't? You should.

966
01:20:18,504 --> 01:20:21,790
- Leonard Wicklow, my associate.
- Jack Henziger.

967
01:20:21,925 --> 01:20:23,917
Spikey! They let you in again?

968
01:20:24,052 --> 01:20:26,922
- Not bankrupt yet?
- No. Close, but no cigar. Here.

969
01:20:27,054 --> 01:20:30,008
- Party on Thursday. Live music.
- Hey.

970
01:20:31,225 --> 01:20:33,846
Bit early in the day even for me, George.

971
01:20:33,978 --> 01:20:36,102
Er, Leonard Wicklow, JP Henziger.

972
01:20:36,231 --> 01:20:38,804
- Brought your saxophone?
- But of course.

973
01:20:38,983 --> 01:20:44,570
Alik. A cordial invitation from
Potomac Blair to a party on Thursday.

974
01:20:44,697 --> 01:20:47,532
- So what was so important in Leningrad?
- Come on.

975
01:20:47,658 --> 01:20:50,576
You don't care about Leningrad, do you?

976
01:20:50,703 --> 01:20:53,029
I'm sorry I disappeared. Here.

977
01:20:54,124 --> 01:20:57,493
If she was young and beautiful,
I forgive you.

978
01:21:01,172 --> 01:21:05,004
It is so good, Barley.
Really, it is so good to see you.

979
01:21:06,052 --> 01:21:09,137
Welcome to Moscow again.
Welcome to the book fair.

980
01:21:09,264 --> 01:21:11,636
To hell with the book fair.

981
01:21:39,628 --> 01:21:42,001
This is too beautiful to wear.

982
01:22:00,399 --> 01:22:03,234
She is asking... are you married?

983
01:22:04,278 --> 01:22:06,603
No. Not at present.

984
01:22:06,989 --> 01:22:10,156
But tell her that I'm always open to offers.

985
01:22:41,732 --> 01:22:44,485
Lapta! Lapta!

986
01:22:45,612 --> 01:22:47,770
Baseball, cricket...

987
01:22:47,906 --> 01:22:50,112
What's he saying?

988
01:22:50,242 --> 01:22:53,860
Matvey assures me lapta is the origin

989
01:22:53,995 --> 01:22:57,198
of American baseball
and your English cricket.

990
01:22:57,332 --> 01:23:00,583
He believes it was introduced to you
by Russian immigrants.

991
01:23:00,711 --> 01:23:04,459
Well, if that's true,
it's the end of the British Empire.

992
01:23:19,647 --> 01:23:21,438
Now, my news.

993
01:23:21,565 --> 01:23:24,981
After your meeting with Yakov
he missed his next phone call.

994
01:23:25,110 --> 01:23:27,233
I was very worried. But it is all right.

995
01:23:27,362 --> 01:23:31,823
Yakov wrote me a long letter.
He was ill, but he has recovered.

996
01:23:31,950 --> 01:23:36,909
He will make a special visit to Moscow
during the book fair to meet you.

997
01:23:37,039 --> 01:23:39,577
- How was he ill?
- With gipetit.

998
01:23:40,709 --> 01:23:44,837
I... Prasti. Sorry. Er, hepatitis?

999
01:23:45,422 --> 01:23:47,249
I will read it to you.

1000
01:23:47,382 --> 01:23:50,384
It arrived eight days ago.
Igor telephoned at my house.

1001
01:23:50,511 --> 01:23:53,631
- Who's Igor?
- A trusted friend of Yakov.

1002
01:23:53,764 --> 01:23:58,557
He telephoned. He said "I have some
medicine for you." Medicine is a letter.

1003
01:23:58,686 --> 01:24:02,635
I thought he didn't have
any trusted friends except you.

1004
01:24:02,773 --> 01:24:05,063
What does he do, this Igor?

1005
01:24:05,777 --> 01:24:09,561
He is a scientist like Yakov,
at one of the ministries.

1006
01:24:10,073 --> 01:24:14,117
What does it matter? Do you wish me
to translate Yakov's letter or not?

1007
01:24:14,243 --> 01:24:16,283
Go on.

1008
01:24:17,705 --> 01:24:21,750
He is in a special hospital,
perhaps in a special town.

1009
01:24:21,877 --> 01:24:23,371
What town?

1010
01:24:23,503 --> 01:24:28,544
Some of our towns have no names,
even today. Only postal numbers.

1011
01:24:31,886 --> 01:24:34,092
"My darling Katya..."

1012
01:24:39,561 --> 01:24:43,606
He writes love talk. I shall not translate.

1013
01:24:44,691 --> 01:24:46,518
Does he usually do that?

1014
01:24:46,651 --> 01:24:50,020
What "usually"?
It is not usually he writes to me.

1015
01:24:50,530 --> 01:24:52,606
Ah, now we come to you.

1016
01:24:58,247 --> 01:25:04,367
"Please tell our good friend that I shall
try my best to see him during his visit."

1017
01:25:04,503 --> 01:25:09,794
"I will bring more material. If he has
a message for me, he must tell you."

1018
01:25:12,303 --> 01:25:14,426
Do you have a message?

1019
01:25:14,972 --> 01:25:17,011
No. No.

1020
01:25:18,392 --> 01:25:20,883
"Tell him to bring all further questions,

1021
01:25:21,019 --> 01:25:25,267
because after this I do not wish
to answer any more questions."

1022
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:29,646
"Tell him his list should be final and..."

1023
01:25:31,989 --> 01:25:34,195
Like... complete.

1024
01:25:35,409 --> 01:25:36,903
Comprehensive?

1025
01:25:37,036 --> 01:25:40,239
Yes. Comprehensive.

1026
01:25:40,664 --> 01:25:42,705
Com... Comprehensive.

1027
01:25:43,251 --> 01:25:45,493
Full marks.

1028
01:25:54,470 --> 01:25:59,845
He says "Please bring
a sample page of translation,

1029
01:25:59,976 --> 01:26:02,597
but in print, please, if you can."

1030
01:26:03,271 --> 01:26:07,482
"Tell me publishing dates.
Which is the best season?"

1031
01:26:07,608 --> 01:26:08,640
Um...

1032
01:26:08,776 --> 01:26:12,227
"Please make your suggestions
for a title."

1033
01:26:12,905 --> 01:26:18,446
"Will there be an introduction to the
book? Who will write the... digest?"

1034
01:26:20,872 --> 01:26:23,197
Er, the blurb.

1035
01:26:24,792 --> 01:26:26,584
Blurb?

1036
01:26:26,711 --> 01:26:28,750
Yes, the blurb.

1037
01:26:31,425 --> 01:26:33,464
Blurb?!

1038
01:26:34,011 --> 01:26:35,671
Oh!

1039
01:26:38,765 --> 01:26:42,514
Er, it's a war wound.
It's very good. You must tell her.

1040
01:26:42,644 --> 01:26:45,217
- You tell her.
- Fantastic.

1041
01:27:05,334 --> 01:27:07,790
When do you speak to Yakov again?

1042
01:27:10,673 --> 01:27:14,670
You cannot come to the hospital, Barley.
It is not safe.

1043
01:27:15,427 --> 01:27:18,761
If it's not safe for me,
then it's not safe for you.

1044
01:27:21,309 --> 01:27:24,559
- How does he end his letter?
- That is not for you.

1045
01:27:25,438 --> 01:27:29,269
- More love talk, hm?
- Barley, I think it is clear to hedgehog

1046
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:32,069
that you are being a little childish.

1047
01:27:35,115 --> 01:27:37,237
Which hedgehog?

1048
01:27:38,117 --> 01:27:40,443
Why does he write like that?

1049
01:27:41,746 --> 01:27:45,826
He is lonely. He exaggerates
his feelings. It is normal.

1050
01:27:49,378 --> 01:27:51,004
Yeah.

1051
01:27:51,464 --> 01:27:53,504
It's normal.

1052
01:28:12,027 --> 01:28:14,897
That's it! No more! No more fucking tapes!

1053
01:28:27,543 --> 01:28:30,627
Final and comprehensive list. Why?

1054
01:28:31,671 --> 01:28:33,794
He's nervous. Why not?

1055
01:28:34,466 --> 01:28:36,708
Maybe I don't mind the list.

1056
01:28:36,843 --> 01:28:39,513
Maybe I mind him
writing her chatty letters.

1057
01:28:39,638 --> 01:28:41,678
People do when they've been ill.

1058
01:28:41,807 --> 01:28:46,268
Maybe I mind the red car and
the white car. You saw the watch report.

1059
01:28:46,395 --> 01:28:48,886
And Igor. Igor who? Igor when?

1060
01:28:49,022 --> 01:28:50,896
Ned, Ned, Ned, Ned, Ned!

1061
01:28:52,859 --> 01:28:56,988
It's early days. We're all jumpy.

1062
01:29:17,802 --> 01:29:19,426
Katya, Katya.

1063
01:29:19,553 --> 01:29:24,346
Did you know Agatha Christie?
Matvey is crazy for detective fiction.

1064
01:29:24,475 --> 01:29:27,512
Alas, Agatha and I were never introduced.

1065
01:29:27,645 --> 01:29:31,939
Raymond Chandler,
Dorothy Sayers, Conan Doyle...

1066
01:29:35,862 --> 01:29:38,020
Leningrad.

1067
01:29:38,156 --> 01:29:40,195
Family.

1068
01:29:40,950 --> 01:29:43,027
Family. Da.

1069
01:29:53,588 --> 01:29:55,830
What's he saying now?

1070
01:30:05,058 --> 01:30:07,596
He is talking about the siege.

1071
01:30:10,772 --> 01:30:15,980
The Germans were four kilometres
from Leningrad on the south side.

1072
01:30:16,111 --> 01:30:18,483
- I love you.
- You can still see...

1073
01:30:19,406 --> 01:30:25,242
the marks of the machine-gun fire
in the old buildings in the outskirts.

1074
01:30:25,370 --> 01:30:26,699
I love you.

1075
01:30:26,830 --> 01:30:30,365
All my failings were
preparations for meeting you.

1076
01:30:32,169 --> 01:30:36,498
The city refused to... accept defeat.

1077
01:30:37,091 --> 01:30:42,167
- Shostakovich still composed music...
- It's like nothing I have ever known.

1078
01:30:43,263 --> 01:30:44,888
It's...

1079
01:30:45,932 --> 01:30:49,468
unselfish love. Grown-up love.

1080
01:30:49,604 --> 01:30:51,929
- You know it is.
- Barley, please.

1081
01:30:52,064 --> 01:30:54,187
It's mature, absolute,

1082
01:30:56,026 --> 01:30:58,315
thrilling love.

1083
01:31:00,030 --> 01:31:02,902
You have bewitched my family.

1084
01:31:03,409 --> 01:31:09,412
My children think all you British are now
Santa Claus in beautiful tweed clothes.

1085
01:31:10,082 --> 01:31:14,543
There's no Santa Claus.
And nobody is what he seems.

1086
01:31:14,670 --> 01:31:16,710
Except you.

1087
01:31:17,465 --> 01:31:21,593
Why do you want to take away my rights?
Go and sit down.

1088
01:31:29,018 --> 01:31:34,095
I hope you are not being frivolous, Barley.
My life now only has room for truth.

1089
01:31:45,326 --> 01:31:47,200
- What are you doing?
- Shh.

1090
01:32:24,867 --> 01:32:27,323
I'm with you.

1091
01:32:52,311 --> 01:32:54,350
I know it now.

1092
01:33:35,647 --> 01:33:38,054
A final and comprehensive list.

1093
01:33:38,900 --> 01:33:41,605
One chance, then close down.

1094
01:33:43,112 --> 01:33:44,109
Why?

1095
01:33:44,239 --> 01:33:47,240
I really think you should get some sleep.

1096
01:33:47,367 --> 01:33:50,653
- I don't think I'm tired.
- Oh, I think you are.

1097
01:33:51,288 --> 01:33:53,115
I think you're tired as hell.

1098
01:33:53,248 --> 01:33:57,791
If the Sovs were playing Dante back at us,
they wouldn't close him down.

1099
01:33:57,919 --> 01:34:01,419
You wouldn't close him down
if you were Sov, would you?

1100
01:34:01,549 --> 01:34:03,874
I might have to
if my methods were Russian.

1101
01:34:04,009 --> 01:34:05,634
Why?

1102
01:34:06,303 --> 01:34:09,719
Because Dante may not
be presentable any more.

1103
01:34:10,432 --> 01:34:15,224
He may not be able to use the telephone.
He may not be able to use a spoon.

1104
01:34:17,315 --> 01:34:19,354
He may be dead.

1105
01:34:20,693 --> 01:34:24,275
Dante is going to phone Katya
at the hospital today.

1106
01:34:25,072 --> 01:34:28,275
If he does that, will you shut the fuck up?

1107
01:34:29,701 --> 01:34:31,990
Or stay out of my operation?

1108
01:34:36,918 --> 01:34:39,409
You must be very quiet.

1109
01:34:39,962 --> 01:34:44,754
If the children come, we must dress
and we must be very serious.

1110
01:34:45,634 --> 01:34:47,841
I'll tell them I love you.

1111
01:34:48,388 --> 01:34:50,427
I shall not interpret.

1112
01:34:51,558 --> 01:34:53,597
Can I tell you?

1113
01:34:54,269 --> 01:34:56,344
If you are quiet.

1114
01:34:56,479 --> 01:34:58,518
Will you interpret?

1115
01:35:04,404 --> 01:35:06,860
You are my only country now.

1116
01:35:29,095 --> 01:35:31,135
Sorry I'm late.

1117
01:36:57,728 --> 01:36:59,435
Da?

1118
01:37:01,064 --> 01:37:02,143
Are you connected?

1119
01:37:03,316 --> 01:37:05,605
- Bingo.
- We're in business.

1120
01:37:07,737 --> 01:37:10,193
What did he say? Tell me.

1121
01:37:15,204 --> 01:37:18,537
That's a neat fit.
Dante keeps it short.

1122
01:37:18,665 --> 01:37:21,286
Embracing?

1123
01:37:21,418 --> 01:37:23,457
They're happy.

1124
01:37:26,715 --> 01:37:29,171
- Why is he driving?
- Men like to drive women.

1125
01:37:29,301 --> 01:37:31,590
He's a male chauvinist.

1126
01:37:57,371 --> 01:38:01,036
- Your people saying he's still in the flat?
- You see what I see.

1127
01:38:20,728 --> 01:38:23,350
Come on, come on, where's the tape?

1128
01:38:26,150 --> 01:38:28,190
Geronimo.

1129
01:38:29,487 --> 01:38:32,820
Hello, Barley.
What do you think of Cy's lorry?

1130
01:38:32,948 --> 01:38:35,701
- Or "truck", as he calls it.
- It's very impressive.

1131
01:38:35,827 --> 01:38:38,235
- How'd it go, Barley?
- Good.

1132
01:38:38,371 --> 01:38:41,906
Well, we're bang on target, Paddy.
The meeting is on.

1133
01:38:42,125 --> 01:38:46,039
Dante's coming to Moscow on Friday.
He's borrowing that apartment.

1134
01:38:46,170 --> 01:38:48,626
- Well done. What time?
- 1800.

1135
01:38:48,756 --> 01:38:50,584
Good.

1136
01:38:51,343 --> 01:38:53,382
Anything unusual?

1137
01:38:53,929 --> 01:38:58,756
No. Nothing I couldn't handle.
But Katya's not as tough as she thought.

1138
01:38:59,809 --> 01:39:02,929
Wound herself up a bit, I think,
waiting for that phone call.

1139
01:39:03,062 --> 01:39:07,275
But I gave her a cup of tea
and held her hand for a bit.

1140
01:39:09,945 --> 01:39:11,819
Well done.

1141
01:39:13,907 --> 01:39:16,149
Well done indeed.

1142
01:39:30,924 --> 01:39:32,751
Leo, good to see you.

1143
01:39:32,885 --> 01:39:35,173
How's Olga? Still eating?

1144
01:39:35,303 --> 01:39:37,130
How's your dog, Barley?

1145
01:39:37,264 --> 01:39:40,349
Arkady. I haven't got a dog.
Why do you ask?

1146
01:39:40,476 --> 01:39:44,723
Because it's safer to discuss one's dog,
I would say, than one's friends.

1147
01:39:44,855 --> 01:39:47,062
Getting careless in our excitement, huh?

1148
01:39:47,191 --> 01:39:50,773
The informants will have
a good harvest this season.

1149
01:39:52,321 --> 01:39:54,528
- Hello, Barley.
- Alik.

1150
01:40:31,069 --> 01:40:33,108
Katya.

1151
01:40:38,618 --> 01:40:41,784
- Are you well?
- Thank you, I am very well.

1152
01:40:43,665 --> 01:40:46,287
Now, who don't you know?

1153
01:40:54,634 --> 01:40:56,757
Comrades! Ladies and gentlemen!

1154
01:40:57,011 --> 01:41:00,464
To you, and to our
new partnership, welcome.

1155
01:41:01,141 --> 01:41:03,466
Let's make each other free.

1156
01:41:03,602 --> 01:41:06,935
And let's make each other rich.

1157
01:41:07,064 --> 01:41:09,140
We want Barley!

1158
01:41:09,274 --> 01:41:12,228
Barley! Give us a tune! Come on!

1159
01:41:13,361 --> 01:41:16,565
Barley! Barley! Barley! Barley!

1160
01:41:19,493 --> 01:41:24,736
Wickers, you've got a real publisher in
you. When this business is over, go for it.

1161
01:42:33,026 --> 01:42:35,149
- Why Zapadny?
- Ned!

1162
01:42:35,654 --> 01:42:39,817
Barley buys Soviet books.
He's keeping his cover in trim.

1163
01:42:48,750 --> 01:42:51,040
Call it off, Russell.

1164
01:42:53,339 --> 01:42:55,746
You're not tired. You're sick!

1165
01:42:56,341 --> 01:42:58,133
Pixie voices!

1166
01:42:58,260 --> 01:43:02,637
If Dante is blown, Katya's blown.
Why is she still walking around?

1167
01:43:02,764 --> 01:43:04,175
I don't know.

1168
01:43:04,307 --> 01:43:07,891
OK. If Dante's blown,
who was on the hospital phone?

1169
01:43:08,396 --> 01:43:09,391
I don't know.

1170
01:43:09,522 --> 01:43:11,680
If it wasn't Dante,
why didn't she tell Barley?

1171
01:43:11,816 --> 01:43:14,816
And if she did tell Barley,
why isn't Barley telling us?

1172
01:43:14,944 --> 01:43:16,521
I don't know.

1173
01:43:16,695 --> 01:43:19,447
Don't give us hunches. Give us facts.

1174
01:43:19,573 --> 01:43:23,572
You brought us into this. Don't jump
off the tiger at the first fucking stop!

1175
01:43:23,703 --> 01:43:25,612
It's over, Russell.

1176
01:43:25,872 --> 01:43:27,829
Dante is straight.

1177
01:43:27,957 --> 01:43:30,911
Those were your words,
and I loved you for them.

1178
01:43:31,293 --> 01:43:33,120
Ned.

1179
01:43:33,587 --> 01:43:35,663
He's blown.

1180
01:43:35,798 --> 01:43:38,752
We had him, but we lost him.

1181
01:43:39,219 --> 01:43:41,128
It's over.

1182
01:43:42,013 --> 01:43:47,007
And my joe's out there
telling us that he's bang on target.

1183
01:44:11,752 --> 01:44:14,836
This is the flat
where Dante is waiting.

1184
01:44:14,963 --> 01:44:18,913
You'll be glad to hear that
the lift was working this morning.

1185
01:44:19,050 --> 01:44:22,419
Fourth floor, green-painted door,
bang opposite the lift.

1186
01:44:22,554 --> 01:44:26,598
Right. Then in that case
this will be your window.

1187
01:44:27,518 --> 01:44:30,684
Now, when you get in,
let us see you at that window.

1188
01:44:31,814 --> 01:44:33,308
Good.

1189
01:44:33,440 --> 01:44:37,023
Jack will walk you halfway.
Then you're on your own.

1190
01:44:37,152 --> 01:44:41,778
Tell Dante you want to walk out
with as many answers as he can give you.

1191
01:44:43,241 --> 01:44:45,282
This is it. The shopping list.

1192
01:44:45,411 --> 01:44:49,823
You'll have to tell him to wet the pages.
The questions will float to the surface.

1193
01:44:49,957 --> 01:44:52,412
Uh, make sure you bring it back.

1194
01:44:53,752 --> 01:44:56,955
We think the whole thing
will take two hours. Three, for luck.

1195
01:44:57,089 --> 01:45:00,340
Tell him you want a date
for a final meeting to fill in the blanks.

1196
01:45:00,468 --> 01:45:04,679
And when you want to leave,
pull the curtain. We'll pick you up.

1197
01:45:04,805 --> 01:45:06,383
How's that?

1198
01:45:06,515 --> 01:45:08,555
Good.

1199
01:45:08,684 --> 01:45:12,978
Give this to Ned, will you?
Just in case something goes wrong.

1200
01:45:14,106 --> 01:45:16,395
Nothing's going wrong.

1201
01:45:36,546 --> 01:45:39,712
That's it over there. Second from the right.

1202
01:45:52,896 --> 01:45:55,138
You'll be fine from here, Barley.

1203
01:45:56,649 --> 01:45:58,689
Fingers crossed, Jack.

1204
01:45:59,444 --> 01:46:01,483
Cheerio.

1205
01:46:27,556 --> 01:46:29,595
Thank you.

1206
01:46:36,357 --> 01:46:40,189
Sir, the shopping list...
It's only questions, isn't it?

1207
01:46:40,319 --> 01:46:43,486
- It wouldn't tell anyone anything?
- Everything.

1208
01:46:44,156 --> 01:46:47,406
It would tell what we know
by telling what we don't know.

1209
01:46:47,534 --> 01:46:50,618
And it would tell
what we would most like to know.

1210
01:46:50,746 --> 01:46:54,447
If the Sovs get the list, we might as well
have published the notebooks,

1211
01:46:54,584 --> 01:46:57,121
just as Barley promised Dante.

1212
01:47:01,382 --> 01:47:03,670
Yes, I do know.

1213
01:47:05,552 --> 01:47:08,257
Barley's made a deal.

1214
01:47:08,389 --> 01:47:12,054
He's keeping his promise to Dante
in his own way.

1215
01:47:12,185 --> 01:47:14,676
And he's trying to save Katya.

1216
01:47:14,812 --> 01:47:16,971
- He's giving them the list!
- Come on, Ned.

1217
01:47:17,106 --> 01:47:20,356
The Sovs are just waiting
for Barley to give it to them.

1218
01:47:20,484 --> 01:47:22,358
Jesus Christ!

1219
01:47:29,244 --> 01:47:31,948
- Brock, signal the truck.
- Don't!

1220
01:47:32,080 --> 01:47:33,871
- Signal Paddy. Abort.
- Don't!

1221
01:47:43,800 --> 01:47:46,006
Looking good!

1222
01:47:46,136 --> 01:47:48,887
And he's coming back smiling.

1223
01:47:49,389 --> 01:47:51,927
And you can take a long, long vacation.

1224
01:47:53,893 --> 01:47:56,135
My joe's crossed over.

1225
01:48:53,412 --> 01:48:55,037
He went in.

1226
01:48:55,623 --> 01:48:57,699
He never came out.

1227
01:48:57,833 --> 01:48:59,873
About seven hours.

1228
01:49:00,461 --> 01:49:02,205
Yes, sir.

1229
01:49:09,554 --> 01:49:11,879
Shit city, Ned.

1230
01:49:20,023 --> 01:49:22,229
Honour is due.

1231
01:49:32,201 --> 01:49:36,116
Well, folks, better put
the chairs back on the tables.

1232
01:49:40,252 --> 01:49:42,291
Till next time.

1233
01:49:57,227 --> 01:49:59,635
Yekaterina Borisovna Orlova.

1234
01:49:59,771 --> 01:50:01,811
Yes. Katya.

1235
01:50:01,940 --> 01:50:07,860
- The letter was signed "Katya"?
- No, just the initial. "Your loving K."

1236
01:50:08,239 --> 01:50:11,987
British Intelligence showed you
the letter for the first time in Lisbon?

1237
01:50:12,117 --> 01:50:12,698
Yes.

1238
01:50:12,826 --> 01:50:17,405
And it referred to your first meeting
with Savelyev, whom you know as Dante?

1239
01:50:17,539 --> 01:50:19,864
Yes. At Peredelkino.

1240
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,040
But Mrs Orlova was not at Peredelkino?

1241
01:50:22,170 --> 01:50:26,712
- As I keep telling you, I didn't meet her...
- Please. Allow me.

1242
01:50:27,508 --> 01:50:31,126
Did Savelyev arrive at Peredelkino
by himself or with others?

1243
01:50:31,262 --> 01:50:34,013
I don't know. Why don't you ask him?

1244
01:50:34,348 --> 01:50:37,349
Unfortunately,
Professor Savelyev is dead.

1245
01:50:37,476 --> 01:50:40,050
He became very ill with hepatitis.

1246
01:50:41,731 --> 01:50:45,100
A great loss to the Soviet
scientific community.

1247
01:50:46,193 --> 01:50:48,067
We all mourn him.

1248
01:50:51,949 --> 01:50:53,989
Me too.

1249
01:50:55,537 --> 01:50:59,036
I have nothing further
to add to what I have said.

1250
01:50:59,457 --> 01:51:02,743
You have the shopping list -
payment in full.

1251
01:51:03,753 --> 01:51:06,422
Yes. The celebrated list.

1252
01:51:07,173 --> 01:51:11,337
We have a deal.
I expect you to honour that deal.

1253
01:51:12,304 --> 01:51:15,423
Yes, I'm talking about honour,
not ideology.

1254
01:51:15,598 --> 01:51:21,138
I've left a letter behind me just in case
they don't know the difference.

1255
01:51:26,610 --> 01:51:29,101
Tell me about the letter.

1256
01:51:32,199 --> 01:51:35,567
"Dear Nedski, change of plan, old chum."

1257
01:51:37,162 --> 01:51:39,487
"Sorry I couldn't let you know."

1258
01:51:39,622 --> 01:51:42,624
"I thought you'd be onto me
if anyone was."

1259
01:51:43,919 --> 01:51:46,492
"But perhaps you taught me too well."

1260
01:51:47,422 --> 01:51:50,708
"Anyway, Dante is blown,
as you would say."

1261
01:51:52,803 --> 01:51:55,175
"His letter to Katya was a fake."

1262
01:51:56,139 --> 01:51:59,924
"His phone call to the hospital
was KGB-controlled."

1263
01:52:00,603 --> 01:52:03,722
"But Dante and Katya
had worked out a code."

1264
01:52:04,773 --> 01:52:07,062
What did he say?

1265
01:52:07,192 --> 01:52:08,852
Tell me.

1266
01:52:08,986 --> 01:52:12,853
He is taken. Yakov is taken.

1267
01:52:12,990 --> 01:52:15,742
"If he was caught,
he called her by the wrong name."

1268
01:52:15,868 --> 01:52:18,110
He used the wrong name.

1269
01:52:19,121 --> 01:52:23,582
If we are safe, he calls me Alina.
If... if he is caught, Maria.

1270
01:52:23,709 --> 01:52:25,915
He called me Maria.

1271
01:52:27,338 --> 01:52:30,089
He was telling me we are dead.

1272
01:52:41,644 --> 01:52:43,802
Give me the key.

1273
01:52:43,979 --> 01:52:48,726
"So there we were. And I was thinking
'Why haven't they arrested us?"'

1274
01:52:51,237 --> 01:52:53,609
"It took me a while to work it out."

1275
01:52:53,740 --> 01:52:57,274
"But of course!
They wanted the shopping list."

1276
01:52:58,161 --> 01:52:59,952
"So there was the crunch:

1277
01:53:00,079 --> 01:53:05,205
to save your precious secrets,
or to trade them for Katya and her family."

1278
01:53:05,335 --> 01:53:08,040
"The easiest decision I ever made."

1279
01:53:08,797 --> 01:53:12,581
"And if you wouldn't have done the same,
then you've learned nothing."

1280
01:53:12,717 --> 01:53:14,377
"Dante was right."

1281
01:53:14,511 --> 01:53:20,632
"The grey men are keeping alive the arms
race, which nobody is supposed to want."

1282
01:53:23,478 --> 01:53:27,725
"It's all over for the secrets game.
Your day is done, old boy."

1283
01:53:27,858 --> 01:53:30,146
"Publish and be safe."

1284
01:53:30,986 --> 01:53:35,031
I need to betray my country,
and I haven't got much time.

1285
01:53:36,534 --> 01:53:41,160
And don't tell me you don't know
who to get in touch with. Just do it, hm?

1286
01:53:45,208 --> 01:53:50,001
I want to meet them in the morning
and agree a contract. All right?

1287
01:53:54,510 --> 01:53:56,419
"I did my best for you, Ned."

1288
01:53:56,554 --> 01:53:59,887
"But now I have to do my best
for Dante, and for Katya."

1289
01:54:01,475 --> 01:54:03,764
Smile. You must smile.

1290
01:54:03,894 --> 01:54:07,145
They're watching us.
Your side and my side.

1291
01:54:08,191 --> 01:54:10,516
We're going to beat them both.

1292
01:54:14,822 --> 01:54:17,906
I can't save Yakov. Nothing can.

1293
01:54:20,995 --> 01:54:23,118
But you're safe.

1294
01:54:23,248 --> 01:54:26,451
The children are safe.
Uncle Matvey's safe.

1295
01:54:31,172 --> 01:54:33,211
I love you.

1296
01:54:33,925 --> 01:54:36,297
And I won't let you down.

1297
01:54:47,605 --> 01:54:52,563
"It was my first good contract.
Real people for unreal arguments."

1298
01:54:53,861 --> 01:54:56,567
"I got everything I wanted,

1299
01:54:56,698 --> 01:55:00,945
down to a safe passage for Wicklow,
Henziger and the others."

1300
01:55:03,163 --> 01:55:06,579
"No doubt there'll be
hell to pay at your end."

1301
01:55:07,792 --> 01:55:11,244
"But you shouldn't open
other people's letters."

1302
01:55:12,006 --> 01:55:15,090
"Love, and luck. Barley."

1303
01:55:19,596 --> 01:55:21,636
What about Russell?

1304
01:55:22,098 --> 01:55:24,424
Russell's a survivor.

1305
01:55:25,435 --> 01:55:29,184
Rumour has it that the shopping list
was really a brilliant deception,

1306
01:55:29,315 --> 01:55:31,888
planted on the Russians
by our clever Russell,

1307
01:55:32,026 --> 01:55:34,563
who also started the rumour.

1308
01:55:34,695 --> 01:55:39,736
If he can get the Sovs to believe it,
everything's back to square one.

1309
01:55:39,866 --> 01:55:42,274
Dante need never have bothered.

1310
01:55:43,579 --> 01:55:45,619
And Barley?

1311
01:55:46,457 --> 01:55:48,663
Oh, Barley.

1312
01:55:49,001 --> 01:55:52,251
He's home free. Back in Lisbon.

1313
01:55:52,379 --> 01:55:54,787
It's not a large flat, of course.

1314
01:55:55,632 --> 01:56:00,011
But by Moscow standards...
We'll all squeeze in.

1315
01:56:00,888 --> 01:56:03,379
Still backing your Russia, Barley?

1316
01:56:04,267 --> 01:56:06,306
Well, we'll see.

1317
01:56:06,435 --> 01:56:11,809
You know, I chose this flat because
I like to watch the ships come in.

1318
01:56:12,983 --> 01:56:16,234
I must have known
that one day it would be my ship.

1319
01:56:17,113 --> 01:56:20,233
And you think that Katya's
going to be on it?

1320
01:56:21,159 --> 01:56:23,650
Well, perhaps it's your due.

1321
01:56:23,786 --> 01:56:27,998
It took some guts. And you seem
to think you did the decent thing.

1322
01:56:31,503 --> 01:56:33,709
Good luck, Barley.

1323
01:57:01,199 --> 01:57:03,238
Katya!

1324
01:57:06,538 --> 01:57:08,578
Come on!

1325
01:57:11,710 --> 01:57:14,462
Come on, Katya! Come on!
