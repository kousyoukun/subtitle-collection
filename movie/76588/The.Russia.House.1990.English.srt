1
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,200
<i>(1 st man) Yekaterina Orlova. Katya?</i>

2
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,920
<i>(2nd man) Never heard of her.</i>

3
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,240
<i>(3rd man) The patronymic's Borisovna.
Katya Borisovna Orlova.</i>

4
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,080
<i>- Have a think, Barley.
- Don't know a Katya.</i>

5
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,360
<i>Never screwed one,
never flirted with one,</i>

6
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,880
<i>never proposed to one,
never even married one.</i>

7
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,800
<i>What is she, the usual fat-arsed frump?</i>

8
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,000
<i>(1 st man) She visited the British Council's
audio fair in Moscow exactly a week ago.</i>

9
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,040
<i>(4th man) Audio fair?</i>

10
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,240
<i>(Barley) Cassettes.
Books of the bloody future.</i>

11
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,520
<i>- (4th man) So why didn't you go?
- (Barley) I can go. I can not go.</i>

12
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,680
<i>I'm my own man. But you wouldn't
know anything about that.</i>

13
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,840
<i>(American man) Crap, Barley. You rented
a stand, booked your hotel, your flight...</i>

14
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,160
<i>Why didn't you show up?</i>

15
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,960
<i>(Barley) I have a board.
I have family shareholders.</i>

16
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,760
<i>The firm's having withdrawal pains at the
bank, if it's any of your bloody business.</i>

17
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,840
<i>(4th man) It is.</i>

18
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,040
<i>Tell me something.
Do you know Niki Landau?</i>

19
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,680
Excuse me. Do you know
Mr Bartholomew Scott Blair?

20
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,520
<i>Yeah, I know Niki. Short-arse Polish
cockney sales rep. Goes at it like a rabbit.</i>

21
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,320
Barley? Sure, I know Barley.

22
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,800
House of Abercrombie and Blair,
publishers, drunk or sober.

23
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,800
A gent. One of the best.

24
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,080
I must speak to Mr Scott Blair.
It is very urgent.

25
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,800
He's not here, darling.

26
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,280
But he was not here yesterday.

27
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,640
Mr Scott Blair never came. He's absent.
AWOL. Not among those present. Sorry.

28
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,160
<i>(Barley) Irritating little sod.
I'm quite fond of him really.</i>

29
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,720
I have an important manuscript for him.
It is for Mr Blair. Only for Mr Blair.

30
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,760
Listen, I'm trying to make a living here.
And not for Mr Blair, love him as I may.

31
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,720
<i>(3rd man) Might one inquire
why she should ask Niki about you?</i>

32
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,680
<i>(Barley) I don't know. I don't know her.</i>

33
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,000
<i>(4th man) So you know Niki,
but not Katya?</i>

34
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,680
Oh, now you're getting it, old boy.

35
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,920
- Is that Scotch over there?
- Help yourself.

36
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,160
Hold everything.

37
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,880
OK.

38
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,280
You must be very kind and help me.

39
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,600
A Russian friend of mine
has written an important novel.

40
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,040
Its message is important
for all of mankind.

41
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,320
Nice.

42
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,960
In spite of glasnost, my friend's
novel cannot yet be published...

43
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,520
in the Soviet Union.

44
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:04,440
Mr Scott Blair has undertaken
to publish it... with discretion.

45
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,720
Don't worry. With Abercrombie and Blair,

46
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,160
your friend's book is virtually guaranteed
to appear in total secrecy.

47
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:19,680
If you love peace, please,
take this to England to Mr Scott Blair.

48
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,320
- It is a gift of trust.
- It is better that you smile.

49
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,120
- Excuse me?
- Smile.

50
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,880
This is Anglo-Soviet cultural exchange.
We smile, we exchange culture.

51
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,280
Looking scared is something different.
Got it in there, have we?

52
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,720
This is dangerous for you.
You must believe in what you are doing.

53
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,000
Smile.

54
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,360
We smile, we kiss. Formal Russian kiss.

55
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,440
That's right.

56
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,880
Now we've done it. You have brought me
an official farewell gift from...

57
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,880
October Publishing
on the last day of the fair.

58
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,800
<i>And I have given you "Shakespeare's"
Sonnets for Careful Drivers.</i>

59
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,400
Would you... like
a nice dinner out somewhere?

60
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,400
It is not convenient.

61
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,080
Thank you.

62
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,840
<i>(1 st man) You can't think of any reason
why a book editor called Katya Orlova</i>

63
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,480
<i>should risk her neck
to send you a manuscript?</i>

64
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,880
Barley?

65
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,160
Who said..."risk her neck"?

66
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,000
I did.

67
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,240
- Must be quite a book.
- It is.

68
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,440
- May I see it?
- Let's begin with the letter.

69
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,600
<i>(groans)</i>

70
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,280
<i>"Personal. For Mr Bartholomew
Scott Blair. Urgent. "</i>

71
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,680
We'd like to find out why a woman
you don't know should send you a letter

72
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,040
beginning "My beloved Barley",
and sign herself "Your loving K".

73
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,560
She's potty. Certifiable.

74
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,760
Where is this manuscript?

75
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,680
<i>- That's none of your business.
- Like hell it isn't.</i>

76
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,800
<i>She sent it to me as a publisher.</i>

77
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,480
- It's a bloody sight more mine than yours.
- Please calm down.

78
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,360
It's in safe hands, Barley.

79
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,640
The manuscript was in three notebooks.

80
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:31,920
<i>When Niki couldn't find you in London,
he had the sense to bring them to us.</i>

81
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,760
The first notebook is worthless,
scientifically speaking.

82
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,680
Oh?

83
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,800
Peacenik manifestos, slogans,
poems, quotations.

84
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,360
It has psychological interest, Minister,
in so far as the writer sounds...

85
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,600
Absolutely barking.

86
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,320
- Would "you" say?
- It's not a medical term, sir.

87
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,320
Unstable, perhaps.

88
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,760
- As for notebooks two and three?
- Genuine science.

89
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,440
Written by someone in the business.
No question.

90
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,840
The business?

91
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:06,680
Destruction paths, payloads, aim points,
bias, rate of burn, trajectories, telemetry.

92
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,280
Of course, it doesn't necessarily
describe the true state of affairs.

93
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,520
What the hell "does" it purport to describe?

94
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:17,480
In a nutshell, the Soviet's strategic
capability for waging nuclear war.

95
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,720
And addressed to boozy Barley Blair.

96
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,240
Well, if it's strategic, we can't
evaluate it without the Americans.

97
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,760
So it's their baby, not ours.

98
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,000
- Throw Scott Blair to the Americans.
- Unfortunately, we haven't found him yet.

99
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,960
Eureka: We've got him.

100
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,560
A Lisbon bank account, my dears:

101
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,760
- We've got him.
- Lisbon.

102
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,680
<i>- Why did you run away?
- (Barley) Run away? I own a flat here.</i>

103
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,680
"(American accent)" Why Lisbon, Barley?

104
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,920
"(mimics accent)" Why Langley, Bob?

105
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,560
You brought a woman?

106
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,760
What's it to you if I brought a woman,
a man or a fuckin' Muscovy duck?

107
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,520
What do you do with yourself
in Lisbon, Barley?

108
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,520
Well, I was having a drink.

109
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,120
<i>Until I was interrupted.</i>

110
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,600
<i>(Barley chuckling)</i>

111
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,280
- Mr Blair?
- Eh?

112
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:42,280
I believe I'm addressing Mr Bartholomew
Scott Blair. Yes? Correct?

113
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,080
- Yes.
- I'm Merrydew. I'm from the embassy.

114
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,200
We received a rather urgent
message for you over our link.

115
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,000
Are you trying to tell me
someone's dead, old boy?

116
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,120
No. That would be consular.
I'm commercial.

117
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:00,040
Well, I never knew an honest debt
that couldn't wait till Monday.

118
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,360
Loosen your girdle, Merrydew.
Have a drink with the unwashed.

119
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:08,160
I say, Blair, the man's the Queen's
emissary, for Christ's sake.

120
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,640
Have they moved the embassy, or are you
hijacking me? What's going on, tubby?

121
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,160
- I'm commercial. Strictly commercial.
- Mr Blair, sir?

122
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,360
My name's Ned.

123
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,760
I'm about to move the goal posts.

124
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:44,080
There's no urgent message. There's no
crisis in your affairs - beyond the usual.

125
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,280
I'm from British Intelligence.

126
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,560
Come and meet the others.

127
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,360
This is Clive. This is Walter.

128
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,840
Over here is Bob, who is "almost" family.
Meet Barley, everyone.

129
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,800
- Hello, Barley:
- Proud to know you, Barley.

130
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,640
I'm the odd man out here. I work
for the Central Intelligence Agency,

131
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,040
which, as you probably know, is based
in Langley in the state of Virginia.

132
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,040
Let's have some fun. Let's do some good.

133
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,240
Now isn't that jolly?

134
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:20,080
So, where are we all off to?
Nicaragua? Chile? Iran?

135
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,800
Or are we just assassinating
some local nuisance?

136
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,480
Don't rant. Sit down.

137
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,760
Perhaps you can tell us
what this letter's all about.

138
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,720
- Recognise the handwriting?
- Read it slowly.

139
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,240
Take all the time in the world, Barley.

140
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,600
She's barmy.

141
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,640
"(Barley)" Who is she?

142
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,640
Yekaterina Orlova. Katya?

143
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,360
- Never heard of her.
- The patronymic's Borisovna.

144
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,160
Katya Borisovna Orlova.
Have a think, Barley.

145
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,720
I don't know a Katya. Never screwed one,

146
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:20,040
<i>never flirted with one, never proposed
to one, never even married one.</i>

147
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,080
<i>What is she, the usual fat-arsed frump?</i>

148
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,240
<i>So, she wrote you a letter
signed "Your loving K",</i>

149
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:32,880
- and you tell me you don't know her?
- I told you. I never met the hag.

150
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,080
She's off her tree.

151
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,440
She wasn't even there.

152
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,080
- Where?
- At Peredelkino.

153
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,680
<i>It's a Soviet writers' village.</i>

154
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,400
<i>They value their writers. The ones
who behave get their own dachas.</i>

155
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,480
I was lucky enough to be a guest.

156
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,200
When was this?

157
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,720
Three or four months ago.
One of my trips.

158
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,040
But there wasn't any Katya.

159
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,960
<i>- What happened?
- I was brilliant.</i>

160
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,640
<i>- Yes?
- Oh, yes.</i>

161
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,040
<i>How to save the world between
lunch and dinner. I was flying.</i>

162
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,160
I "believe" in the new Russia.
You may not, but I do.

163
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:19,160
20 years ago, it was just a pipe dream.
Today, it's our only hope.

164
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,520
We thought we could bankrupt you
by raising the stakes in the arms race.

165
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,640
Gambling with the fate of the human race.

166
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,200
Barley, you won your gamble.
Nuclear peace for 40 years.

167
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,040
Oh, rubbish. What peace?

168
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:37,440
Ask the Czechs, the Vietnamese,
the Koreans. Ask the Afghans.

169
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:41,920
No. If there is to be hope,
we must all betray our countries.

170
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:47,240
We have to save each other,
because all victims are equal.

171
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,120
And none is more equal than others.

172
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,520
It's everyone's duty to start the avalanche.

173
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,280
A heroic thought, Barley.

174
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,080
Listen, nowadays you have
to think like a hero

175
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,720
just to behave like
a merely decent human being.

176
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,320
And did you believe this nonsense?

177
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,560
I don't know. I believe it when I say it.

178
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,480
But you've got to be there.

179
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,480
You're taking a leak
in some filthy public urinal,

180
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,680
and the man in the next stall leans across
and asks you about God, or Kafka,

181
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,600
or freedom versus responsibility.

182
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,200
So you tell him. Because you know.
Because you're from the West.

183
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:38,560
And before you've finished shaking your
dick, you think "What a great country."

184
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,120
That's why I love them.

185
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,520
And they're very fond of me.

186
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:51,440
Anyway... later we talked about jazz,
and I played some.

187
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,800
What, somebody had a saxophone?

188
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,920
What else? Drum kit? Rhythm section?

189
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,800
<i>(# saxophone effect
through a comb and paper)</i>

190
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,880
<i>(# improvised jazz continues)</i>

191
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,040
How many women were there?

192
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,320
Three or four. But no Katya.

193
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,120
But there was "someone," wasn't there?

194
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,320
Yes. There was someone.

195
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,400
Someone who is the reason
why we're all here. Yes?

196
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,600
- A man or a woman?
- Name?

197
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:05,360
Christ. The way you people
come alive when you smell blood.

198
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,680
<i>(amplified swish)</i>

199
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,080
<i>(amplified crashing)</i>

200
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,440
<i>(amplified)</i>

201
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,720
They called him... Dante.

202
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,200
<i>As in "Inferno".</i>

203
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:39,240
<i>The others said he was on holiday.
A drinking holiday.</i>

204
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,960
He worked some place
where drinking wasn't on.

205
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,480
<i>Everyone deferred to him.</i>

206
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,120
<i>He never spoke.
He just got drunk and stared.</i>

207
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,720
- Stared?
- Mm. At me.

208
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,480
<i>Did Dante arrive on his own
or with others?</i>

209
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,280
I don't know.

210
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,360
Keep going.

211
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,640
Then I decided to give them all
a rest from wonderful me,

212
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,120
let them talk Russian for a while.

213
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,360
There's a graveyard
a couple of hundred yards up the hill.

214
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,800
<i>It's a place of pilgrimage.</i>

215
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,200
<i>(speaks Russian)</i>

216
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,600
"If there is to be hope,
we must all betray our countries."

217
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,960
Ah, Dante, old chum.

218
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,600
Come to pay your respects
to old Boris, have you?

219
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,680
Boris Pasternak.

220
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,200
Do you think he knows
people are allowed to read him again?

221
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:39,600
"All victims are equal.
None is more equal than others."

222
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,760
Yes, well... some "write" better than others.

223
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,840
"How sweet it is to hate one's native land,
to desire its ruin,

224
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:54,080
and in its ruin to discern
the dawn of universal rebirth."

225
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,440
- Pasternak?
- No. Pecherin. An earlier poet.

226
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:04,840
Pecherin understood that it's possible to
love your country while hating its system.

227
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,920
If you say so.

228
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,320
I love my country.

229
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,120
I love it too - "your" country.

230
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,960
And I'm reasonably fond of my own.

231
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:21,760
To save it, perhaps
it's necessary to betray it. Yes?

232
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,480
Because you and I, we love truth.

233
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,160
Who are you, Dante?

234
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,080
What do you do for a living?

235
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,160
I am a moral outcast.

236
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,880
Oh, it's always nice to meet a writer.

237
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,480
And what sort of rubbish
are you turning out now?

238
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,560
Lies.

239
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,080
I am the lie.

240
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,760
Really?

241
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,120
You spoke the truth.

242
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:04,040
Promise me that you are not a spy, and
then I will make you a promise in return.

243
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:08,080
I'm not a spy, actually. Not my line.

244
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,760
You are nobody's spy? Not even ours?

245
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,600
Dante, I'm getting a bit jumpy,
to be honest.

246
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,280
I'm nobody's spy.

247
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,440
Let's talk about something else.
How about chess?

248
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:31,400
Oh, chess. In chess there are no lies.
But in my game lies are everything.

249
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,800
What game is that?

250
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,240
The Soviet knight is dying
inside his armour.

251
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,280
You are in danger only from our lies.

252
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,480
I commit the lie every day.
I lie even to my masters.

253
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,960
So, promise me that if I ever find
the courage to think like a hero,

254
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:53,280
then you will act like
a merely decent human being. Right?

255
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:58,280
- Dante, leave me out, will you?
- Hey, you cannot reject me.

256
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,680
Because I am strengthened
by your rejection.

257
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,960
So, promise me.

258
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,840
What the hell am I promising,
for God's sake?

259
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,880
Promise.

260
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,160
All right.

261
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,240
If you ever manage to be a hero,

262
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,480
I'll be a... decent human being.

263
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,760
OK?

264
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,400
Promise?

265
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,480
I promise.

266
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,960
Why didn't you come to us? : I know why.
You put your head in the sand.

267
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,640
Don't know because don't "want" to know.

268
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,440
I'm sorry, but we're going to need
your rather serious help.

269
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,240
<i>Then I asked him "What am I supposed
to be promising, for God's sake?"</i>

270
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,960
<i>Why didn't you come to us? : I know why.
You put your head in the sand.</i>

271
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,400
<i>Don't know because don't want to know.</i>

272
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:00,280
- Who the hell is that?
- Walter? He's a character.

273
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,160
<i>I'm sorry, but we're going to need
your rather serious help.</i>

274
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,200
- That's it.
- And the notebooks?

275
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,520
The notebooks don't mesh
with any disinformation artist,

276
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,440
con man or intelligence peddler we know.

277
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,880
Our psychology and handwriting gurus
tried to fault them.

278
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,360
- And?
- They failed.

279
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,040
Try harder, Russell.

280
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,000
No.

281
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,440
No.

282
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,880
No.

283
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,040
Not even a perhaps or a maybe?

284
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:37,880
No. Not even a tickle, old boy.
They're not in Dante's class.

285
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,520
All right.

286
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,080
Is that Katya?

287
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,200
- That's her.
- You remember her now?

288
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,480
No such luck.

289
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,880
Choose someone else.

290
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,640
We didn't choose you. Dante did.

291
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,080
Because I wasn't a spy.

292
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,640
We're not asking you to build
the beastly rockets or push the button.

293
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,200
Only to help improve
our knowledge of the enemy.

294
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,920
And if the enemy turns out to be a friend,
where's the harm?

295
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:48,400
I thought we were all supposed
to be chums together now.

296
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,360
Oh, my dear Lord:

297
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,200
Because this year it suits them
to roll over and play nice doggie?

298
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,360
Because this year they're
on the floor anyway? You ninny.

299
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,000
All the more reason to spy
the daylights out of 'em.

300
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:03,600
Kick 'em in the balls
every time they get to their knees.

301
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,960
Well, that's where I disagree.

302
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:09,400
I'll back my Russia against yours
any time.

303
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,640
Nah.

304
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,200
I'm sorry, Ned. No go.

305
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,920
Bloody woman. I must've given offence.

306
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,400
She has a point.

307
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,920
Worry about Dante.

308
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,800
He reached out for you.

309
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,240
Would you rather
throw him to the Americans?

310
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,680
Don't be fooled by Bob's Yaley manner.

311
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,240
The Yanks will take Dante,
put him on a spit and have a barbecue.

312
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,600
How will you live with yourself?

313
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,920
I "don't" live with myself.

314
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,880
In fact, I try to give myself a wide berth.

315
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,560
I'm offering you a fresh start.
And a fat cheque.

316
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,960
Never mind the money.
Barley's far too grand.

317
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,240
This is something people write in for.

318
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,920
The chance to be an active player
in the defence of their country.

319
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,000
You live in a free society.
You've no choice.

320
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:34,200
Any decent church would've
burnt you bastards years ago.

321
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,920
You're a fool to use me.

322
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,600
I let people down.

323
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,320
<i>(phone rings)</i>

324
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,080
<i>Abercrombie and Blair.</i>

325
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,320
Is it the office of...
Mr Bartholomew Scott Blair?

326
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,320
<i>Yes. But he isn't in at the moment.</i>

327
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,840
<i>Can I help, or would you
like to leave a message?</i>

328
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,880
No, thank you. It is a publishing matter.

329
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,480
I will telephone again. Thank you.

330
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,920
<i>(Ned) Crowds are good,

331
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,320
<i>Open spaces are good.</i>

332
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,160
<i>Talking in the street is OK, if you have to.</i>

333
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,040
<i>Never, never talk in a car
or in your hotel room,</i>

334
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,040
<i>except for the benefit
of their microphones.</i>

335
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:44,800
<i>If you've read anything about playing
the radio or running the taps, forget it.</i>

336
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,680
That's right. The source
is the star of the show.

337
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:51,720
And the star decides
whether to make the meeting or abort.

338
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,520
This is fun. Is that why you keep it secret?

339
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,640
Did you spot our watchers?

340
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,920
The tramp raiding the dustbin,
the woman with the white shoes,

341
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,880
and, of course, the man with the tracksuit.

342
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,080
You scored nil. Out of a possible 12.

343
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,480
The lesson is
you'll never know who they are.

344
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:21,080
If you need to write something down, use
a single sheet of paper on a hard surface.

345
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,880
That leaves no impression.

346
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,240
How many such surfaces
can you see in this room?

347
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,240
Well, including the windowsill... four.

348
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,400
Seven.

349
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,720
This is often easiest.

350
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,320
Then wipe it clean - rubbing hard.

351
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,280
The issue is "why."

352
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,720
That's what you're looking for all the time.

353
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,560
If we trust the motive, we trust the man.

354
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,840
Then we can trust the material.

355
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,600
Why did Dante pick on Katya?

356
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,440
Why does he put her life at risk?

357
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,600
Why does she let him?

358
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,880
Is "she" a spy?

359
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,240
- It's voice-activated, sir. You switch...
- I know all this. I've had it up to here.

360
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,840
I just want to get it done.
What's the hold-up?

361
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,480
It's everything we ever wanted to know
about Russia and were afraid to ask.

362
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,000
- Sounds like the pot of gold.
- Sounds like a crock of shit.

363
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,920
Some unidentified walk-in is telling us
the Russians are way behind,

364
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,040
they can't hurt us,
we can pull in our horns.

365
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:29,640
Who the hell is gonna
sell that story on the Hill?

366
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,320
Russell?

367
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,480
It could turn around
and bite us right in the ass.

368
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,640
Let the Brits run with it for a while.

369
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,800
Dante is their source,
and, uh... Scott Blair is their problem.

370
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:45,520
I'll go with that, Russell. But I want
Joe and Larry with him in London.

371
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,480
Friendly observers, OK?

372
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,320
You'll do us proud, Barley.

373
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,000
I've brought you a present.

374
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,800
It's not to keep. It's just to sniff.

375
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:09,080
- Am I supposed to offer to publish it?
- Offer him anything he wants.

376
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,200
Say anything you need to say
to keep him with us.

377
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,520
Except the truth?

378
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,840
Bon voyage, Barley.

379
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:24,440
<i>Come back with the goods on Dante,
starting with his real name,</i>

380
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,560
<i>and I'll get you a knighthood for literature.</i>

381
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,840
The Russia House.

382
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,600
Barley Scott Blair.
Abercrombie and Blair?

383
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,120
<i>London. The publishers.</i>

384
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,960
I believe you know Niki Landau.

385
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,080
<i>Yes.</i>

386
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,360
Well, Niki was very insistent that I should
give you a call. How do you do?

387
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,400
How do "you" do?

388
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,280
I'll tell you why I'm calling.
I'm here in Moscow.

389
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:13,320
And Niki's sent you about a ton of tea.
Well, a couple of pounds.

390
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,400
I hope you like tea.

391
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,240
I was wondering
if we could arrange a handover.

392
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,040
<i>- A handover?
- Do you ever escape for lunch?</i>

393
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,320
Yes. Of course.

394
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,600
<i>Well, how about today?
I'm at the Ukraine Hotel.</i>

395
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:31,360
<i>- That would be convenient.
- Good. Marvellous.</i>

396
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,720
Well, I'll be outside from 12.30 on.

397
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,160
<i>- How will I know you?
- Oh, listen, I'm easy to recognise.</i>

398
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:41,320
I look like a large, unmade bed
with a shopping bag attached.

399
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,240
We're off.

400
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,800
Hi. Hello.

401
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,760
You're Katya, of course.

402
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,880
Yes. And you must be Mr Barley.

403
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,040
Yes, indeed. The same. Well done.

404
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,760
Well, er... where shall we go?

405
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,840
I brought your stuff from Niki,
but I'll carry it.

406
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,600
How did you recognise me, Mr Barley?

407
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,960
Well, Niki said you were Russia's answer
to the "Venus de Milo."

408
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,880
That is ridiculous.

409
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,800
I was nearly arrested here
three years ago.

410
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,080
They said I was photographing
a military subject.

411
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,680
- And were you?
- No. A soldier and his girlfriend.

412
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,120
They asked me to take their picture.

413
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,320
Obviously I received the manuscript.

414
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,680
I will take you to where
we can have lunch.

415
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,320
If you do not mind, I will first buy shoes.

416
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,520
Shoes?

417
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,280
Today there is a shipment of shoes.

418
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:40,160
With perestroika, there is
even less available than before.

419
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,680
- Really? I thought things were improving.
- Everything is corrupt and incompetent.

420
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:48,040
Perhaps different people
are now stealing. I don't know.

421
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,960
Keep your voice down.

422
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,280
Complaining is our new human right.

423
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,760
Glasnost gives everyone
the right to complain and accuse,

424
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,160
but it doesn't make more shoes.

425
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,880
Tell me about your new Russian book.

426
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,520
Oh, yes. The book.

427
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:27,680
Well, my problem is that, er,
I don't know the author's real name,

428
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,880
let alone where he gets
all his information from.

429
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,840
Learned his craft and so forth. Hm?

430
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,920
Such personal questions
are not appropriate.

431
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,800
Some writers can only work in obscurity.

432
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,480
But you know publishing, hm?

433
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,840
If a fella's written about
the hill tribes of northern Burma,

434
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,880
well, you're entitled to know if he's
ever been further south than Minsk.

435
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,120
Especially if it's a really important book.
Which this one is.

436
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,880
Dynamite, in fact.

437
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:02,000
The author was inspired by certain
opinions of a British publisher

438
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,400
concerning world peace.

439
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,360
Do you think he'd like
to meet that publisher again?

440
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:12,080
It is not known. This can be established.

441
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,040
The publisher would like
to meet "him" again.

442
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,400
How long are you staying in Moscow,
please, Mr Barley?

443
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:23,400
Seven days... Mrs Katya.

444
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,080
<i>(# plays mournful tune)</i>

445
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,400
- Where do you live?
- With my children.

446
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,960
Your children? How many?

447
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:58,880
I have a boy and a girl.
They are eight and nine years old.

448
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,960
It is not relevant.

449
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,120
What does your husband do?

450
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,480
It is not important.

451
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,000
- Is he a publisher too?
- No.

452
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,000
Is he a writer?

453
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,160
No.

454
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,480
A composer? A cook?

455
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,680
Is he a dressmaker in Vladivostok?

456
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:22,120
His factory prefabricates houses
for rural areas.

457
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:28,120
We are divorced.
Like everybody else in Moscow.

<i>(# mournful tune continues)</i>

459
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,800
Unfortunately, I have
to return to my children now.

460
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,000
Isn't someone looking after them?

461
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:44,080
Well, ring up. Tell them
you've met a fascinating man

462
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:47,040
that wants to talk literature
to you all day.

463
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,920
I'm sorry. I cannot.

464
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,360
Oh, look, we've hardly met.

465
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,040
I need time.

466
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:04,040
I've got 10,000 enormously
serious things to discuss

467
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,360
with a beautiful Russian woman.

468
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,240
I don't bite, I don't lie...
Have dinner with me.

469
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,760
- At least show me something of Moscow.
- It is not convenient.

470
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,520
- Then give me your home number.
- It is not convenient.

471
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,600
- Will you call me, then?
- Perhaps.

472
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,680
When?

473
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,080
Perhaps I shall call you late tonight.

474
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,080
No, not "perhaps".

475
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,160
I shall call you.

476
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,480
You forgot to give her the tea.

477
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,480
- Mr Blair, sir?
- Wicklow.

478
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,920
Excellent morning's work, sir.
No problems.

479
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:06,520
Oh, by the way, you asked why so many
Russians use the word "convenient".

480
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:11,320
In Russian it's "udobno".
But it also means "proper".

481
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,040
- A bit confusing really.
- Yes, it is indeed.

482
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,120
We have an interim, sir.

483
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:37,320
Katya left her office, took a taxi,
unknown destination. We have it covered.

484
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,440
<i>(phone rings)</i>

485
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,680
<i>Da?</i>

486
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,320
<i>Da, eta Alina.</i>

487
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,560
<i>- Dobry dyen.
- Barley:</i>

488
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:59,000
- Welcome to Moscow, my dear chap:
- Alik.

489
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:03,600
Why do you look so healthy? Why
have you no hangover? Are you in love?

490
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,800
How did you know, Alik?

491
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,680
Meet Leonard Carl Wicklow,
our new editor of Soviet books.

492
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,360
Alik "Z"apadny of VAAP,

493
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,080
the all-suffocating
Soviet Copyright Agency.

494
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,720
- How is Barley paying you, Mr Wicklow?
- Oh, Russia's top of the pops these days.

495
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:25,040
Mention to the money boys
that we want to build up a Russian list

496
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,040
and they throw money at us.

497
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:31,720
Have you a sales force, or are you
still relying on divine intervention?

498
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,080
And how about translators?

499
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:39,120
On fiction we will use our own
and take another "5%" royalty. How's that?

500
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,360
- We'll consider it.
- No, I don't think so.

501
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,040
We don't have the margin.

502
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,120
Exactly.

503
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,560
Well done, Wickers.

504
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:55,320
- Jesus, Barley:
- Yuri.

505
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,600
What are you doing here?
You're a month early for the book fair.

506
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,880
Yuri, I want you to meet Len Wicklow,
our new Russian-speaking specialist.

507
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,960
Hello. You a spy?

508
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:08,080
- Only in my spare time, sir.
- Jesus, I like him.

509
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,520
Oh, thank you. Sit down, friend.

510
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,120
Let's deal direct, OK?

511
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,040
To hell with those assholes at VAAP.

512
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,360
Stay away from them.
Especially "Z"apadny.

513
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,600
I don't say he's KGB.

514
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,640
All I say is he needed some damned good
friends to get him back into circulation.

515
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,600
Know what I mean?

516
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,800
<i>- Cheers.
- Na zdorovye.</i>

517
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,480
Oh, Barley... I have something for you.

518
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:41,920
Some of these writers haven't yet
been to jail. But I'm working on it.

519
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:46,720
I'll make them famous in the West
even if it kills them.

520
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,840
<i>(phone rings)</i>

521
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,920
It's me.

522
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,040
Do I disturb you?

523
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,960
Deeply. Come over.

524
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:06,320
You invited me to show you Moscow
tomorrow, I think.

525
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,520
I did. Where do I send the glass coach?

526
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:15,560
I have the tapes, and I've never heard
such pussyfooting around in my life:

527
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,160
Barley has gotta tell Katya:
No more Greta fucking Garbo.

528
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,560
And Dante better shit or get off the pot.

529
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,080
<i>I'm being pelted with crap
in the streets here:</i>

530
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,920
All right, Russell, message understood.

531
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,760
Brock?

532
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,920
Russell's metaphors are becoming
rather scatological.

533
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,800
Signal Paddy at the embassy.
I want him to talk to Barley.

534
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,600
Er, we're this way.

535
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,520
I hope you like churches.

536
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:20,080
In Russia we don't ask that.
It is not convenient.

537
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:23,240
Ah. I think you mean "proper". No?

538
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,320
- Proper?
- Mm.

539
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,920
"Nyet." Convenient.

540
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:41,760
Now you know why hardly anyone
comes up here. Mind your head.

541
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,520
One more to go. This way.

542
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,040
This is just like school.

543
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,320
Dear old, bloody old... school.

544
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,960
Who is that man down there?

545
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,520
Oh, he's my editor. He's keeping lookout.

546
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,080
Are we ready? Thank you, Brock.

547
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,240
Why is an editor keeping a lookout?

548
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,120
Well...

549
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,640
Do you drink this stuff?

550
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,360
No.

551
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,440
Me neither.

552
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,680
What's Dante's real name, huh?

553
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,680
Who is he?

554
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,080
Does he test things?

555
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:53,760
Is he a physicist?
An engineer? Is he army?

556
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,960
Does he like ice cream?

557
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,120
Does he like the movies?

558
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,160
<i>Is he one man? Is he two? Is he a group?</i>

559
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:10,160
Why don't you just start talking
and let's see how it goes?

560
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:13,640
Come on, Katya. You started this, I didn't.

561
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:20,040
Come on, it's me, Barley Blair.
I do jokes, I do bird noises, I drink.

562
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,360
I'm a friend.

563
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:28,080
- Who is he?
- I don't know what I may tell you.

564
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,360
What did he tell you to tell me?

565
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:36,240
Whatever is necessary.
That I should trust you.

566
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:39,120
He was generous. It is his nature.

567
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:43,320
Why did you send me the book
if you didn't trust me?

568
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,960
It was for him that I sent it.
I did not select you, he did.

569
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,080
Oh.

570
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,480
He is... my friend.

571
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,240
Is this what you usually do for friends?

572
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:03,000
Smuggle their manuscripts
out to the West?

573
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,400
Risk your life, your children?

574
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,520
Does he understand the consequences?
Does he care?

575
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,560
He is reconciled.

576
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,240
- Are you?
- Of course.

577
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,320
And your children?

578
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:20,080
It is for them and their generation.

579
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,680
He is inspired by the new openness here.

580
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,880
But he knows that nothing
will change by itself.

581
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,600
- And you agree?
- Yes: And so do you:

582
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,920
You spoke for him.
It is for you we are here:

583
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,840
That's worth a drink.

584
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:55,320
He is not a soldier.
He is a scientist. He is a physicist.

585
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:59,120
<i>- Also qualified in aspects of engineering.
- Better: Ha-ha:</i>

586
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,920
Engineering.
We're making progress, gentlemen.

587
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,920
Where was he trained?

588
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,760
He went to the LITMO.

589
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,000
Afterwards to postgraduate studies
at the university.

590
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,160
What's the LITMO?

591
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:15,880
Leningrad Institute of Mechanical and
Optical Science: Write that down, fellas.

592
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:20,120
LITMO is the Leningrad Institute
for Mechanical and Optical Science.

593
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:25,120
He was extremely brilliant.
At 14 he won a mathematics olympiad.

594
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,200
Mathematics.

595
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
When I was at school,
they were the people I couldn't stand.

596
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:38,400
Naturally, if you are not so intelligent,
you will be jealous.

597
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:46,360
<i>(hugely amplified clanging)</i>

<i>(bells ring)</i>

599
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,640
From university he went
to Academgorodok,

600
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,320
the City of Science at Novosibirsk.

601
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:01,800
He was... like a meteor there.

602
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,960
Is that where you met him?

603
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,880
No:

604
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,960
In Leningrad. I was a child.
A great intellectual of 16.

605
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,640
- I met Yakov at the club...
- Yakov?

606
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:16,120
- Yakov is Dante?
- Yes. Yakov.

607
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:19,400
- First name Yakov:
- Jacky.

608
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:22,560
We met at the Club of Scientists.

609
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:25,960
It was at a closed showing
of a foreign film.

610
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:29,440
<i>It was by Godard.
А bout de souffle. Breathless.</i>

611
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,720
I went with my father.

612
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,240
And what year are we talking about now?

613
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,960
1968.

614
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:41,360
You remember '68?

615
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:45,200
The Paris students at the barricades,
American students against Vietnam,

616
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:48,320
and for us it was Czechoslovakia.

617
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:56,560
Yakov said that the Russians
would never stop

618
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:59,440
the extraordinary reforms
happening there.

619
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,880
It was the start of a new age.

620
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:05,080
He had come back to Leningrad
to be a part of it.

621
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,320
- From where?
- From the military.

622
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:12,480
They had seduced him with privileges,
money for his researches...

623
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,560
They had corrupted him.

624
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:20,200
He had come back to Leningrad
to recover his innocence.

625
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,200
He was beautiful.

626
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,600
Not like a scientist, like an...

627
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,840
artist.

628
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:33,400
So you fell in love with him.

629
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:38,320
He was my first lover.

630
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,720
It was the same night
that the tanks entered Prague.

631
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:04,200
There was no more innocence anywhere.

632
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,600
Yakov said that innocence
was a delusion.

633
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:12,240
And a few weeks later
he returned to the military.

634
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:16,440
I did not talk to him for many years.

635
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:23,400
Until last year, when he met a British
publisher who spoke to his heart.

636
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,600
Next day, Yakov telephoned me
at the office.

637
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:32,680
He had decided what he must do.
He needed my help.

638
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:37,320
<i>Is he alone in this?
Does he need anyone else's help?</i>

639
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:39,440
<i>No.</i>

640
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:42,480
<i>- None of his drinking friends?
- No.</i>

641
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,440
How can you be so certain?

642
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:51,920
Because I am certain that
in his thoughts he is completely alone.

643
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,120
Are you happy with him?

644
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:01,160
- Please?
- I mean, er... do you like him?

645
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:05,400
As well as loving him.
Does he make you laugh? Hm?

646
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:09,400
I believe that Yakov
is a great and important man,

647
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:15,920
who is trying to restore himself
and cannot survive without me.

648
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:20,120
Oh.

649
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:25,320
Jesus Christ, Mother of God: It's Savelyev:

650
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:29,640
Yakov Yefremovich Savelyev:

651
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:35,680
Did he mention anything about, er...
falsification of results?

652
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:44,640
He talks about "the great lie".
Everything is part of the great lie.

653
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,400
Ah. Go on.

654
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:49,240
Are you part of the great lie also, Barley?

655
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:50,040
What?

656
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,360
I think I am also allowed to ask questions.

657
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,440
Oh, of course. Ask.

658
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:01,080
Are you Mr Bartholomew Scott Blair?

659
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,600
- Aw, for God's sake...
- Are you?

660
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,800
- Yes.
- Are you a publisher?

661
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,840
Yes.

662
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,680
Are you a spy?

663
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,120
No.

664
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,920
Are you alone in this,
or were you sent by others?

665
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:28,440
Answer her.

666
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:34,960
I'm alone.

667
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,600
Jesus: Fuck.

668
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,960
I'm alone, and that's the God's truth.

669
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:48,280
Never been more alone.

670
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:03,400
Yakov said he will meet you in Leningrad
in four days from now.

671
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:06,440
He has proposed three places
and three times.

672
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:11,040
He will keep one of the appointments,
if he can.

673
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,040
Good.

674
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:17,440
<i>(cork pops)</i>

675
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:20,160
Reconstruction. Openness.

676
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,200
He's going to reconstruct
the balance of terror,

677
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:26,680
and open the ultimate can of worms.

678
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:31,440
Savelyev? : My God, if Dante is Savelyev,
you guys don't know what you've got:

679
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,960
<i>- Yes, we do. Trouble.
- (phone rings)</i>

680
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:37,040
Yakov Savelyev is
the right hand of God over there.

681
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:41,360
<i>(scientist) And he says it's shit?
The Soviet threat's one big lie?</i>

682
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:42,920
<i>And look at this.</i>

683
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:46,680
- They're bullshitting the Kremlin.
- Honour is due, Ned.

684
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,480
<i>Russell, I need your money.
And your love.</i>

685
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:53,320
I want an American partner for Barley.
I want him in Leningrad on Friday.

686
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,880
I hear you, Ned. I'll get right back to you.

687
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:02,400
If he says they can't hit Nevada on a clear
day, you better believe it. And be joyful.

688
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:06,960
Joyful? Most of our customers
come to this town with contracts

689
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:11,680
to bring peace and prosperity to
the arms industry for the next "5"0 years.

690
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,200
But how the fuck
do you peddle an arms race

691
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:17,480
when the only asshole you've got
to race against is yourself?

692
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,680
<i>(phone rings)</i>

693
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,200
The night train to Leningrad.

694
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:43,360
I may have mentioned Mr Potomac Books,
my new American partner?

695
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:47,440
Well, he's doing Leningrad,
and he summoned me for a powwow.

696
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,600
<i>- Powwow?
- I thought you knew English.</i>

697
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,440
"Powwow" is not English.

698
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,760
- You must sit down.
- "Sit down? Why?"

699
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:00,480
It is our custom before a long journey
first to sit down.

700
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,440
Well, I'm lying down. Won't that do?

701
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:09,920
Well... you are supposed
to sit on your luggage

702
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:12,720
and sigh a little and cross yourself.

703
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:18,280
Hold everything.

704
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,240
OK.

705
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:29,120
<i>(sighs)</i>

706
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,960
I was more comfortable lying down.

707
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:35,280
Are you coming back to Moscow?

708
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:38,320
<i>No, not this time.
I have to fly straight back to school.</i>

709
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:40,000
School?

710
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:43,360
<i>Work. England.
It's a stupid expression of mine.</i>

711
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:45,920
I hope I didn't bore you last night.

712
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:48,280
<i>You did not bore me.</i>

713
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,640
Oh. Perhaps next time.

714
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:55,120
I'll make a special journey
just to talk about myself.

715
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,440
I wish you a good journey, Barley.

716
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:00,880
I'll miss you.

717
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:28,080
I want you to know something, Scott.
This little country is on the move.

718
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:29,960
I smell hope here.

719
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:32,480
I smell change. I smell commerce.

720
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:38,440
And we are buying ourselves a piece of it.
I'm proud. Proud.

721
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:45,440
0800 hours. Barley and Wicklow
are in Leningrad.

722
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:47,560
Checked in at the Pribaltiyskaya Hotel.

723
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,400
<i>Good. We're on schedule.</i>

724
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:53,120
<i>Barley's got three chances
to make contact.</i>

725
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:55,320
<i>Now it's up to Dante.</i>

726
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:43,600
You want to sell me something?

727
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:48,480
Cigarettes, Scotch, drugs, currency?

728
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,680
No, thanks. Cheerio.

729
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:53,840
You get lost?

730
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:56,480
That's a good idea. Why don't "you" try it?

731
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:06,160
One down, two to go.

732
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,280
Where are you, Dante?

733
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:24,440
Sir. Excuse me, sir,
but I think we are acquainted.

734
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:28,880
Good God: The great Dante,
as I live and breathe:

735
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:33,280
We met at that writer's party
at Peredelkino, remember?

736
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,600
The only two sober people there.

737
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,800
- How are you?
- I'm very well.

738
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,720
Welcome to Leningrad.

739
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:45,000
You can walk a little?
It is safest to keep moving.

740
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:47,320
Yes, they told me that.

741
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:53,840
Barley's made contact: He's done it.

742
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:56,680
Unfortunately, he couldn't find me.

743
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:01,880
So he gave it to our authorities.
People of... discretion. Experts.

744
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:05,280
You have betrayed me.

745
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,760
Nobody's betrayed you.

746
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:12,040
I told you. Your manuscript
went astray, that's all.

747
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,800
Our authorities "admire" your book.

748
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:18,920
But they need to know if it's true.

749
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,800
The best way would be
for you to talk with them.

750
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:26,960
You came to tell me
you refuse to publish me?

751
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:29,280
Dante, you're going too fast.

752
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:31,320
Russia has no time.

753
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:34,440
When the ice is thin,
you have to walk fast.

754
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:36,800
To lose time is to lose everything.

755
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:42,360
And then we all slide into the grave.
So be it. I will be the first corpse.

756
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:44,840
And Katya second. What about her?

757
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,920
She also chose.

758
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:51,040
If we act together,
we will survive together.

759
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:55,080
Have you forgotten
your words at Peredelkino?

760
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:00,560
I am not the man you thought I was.

761
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:05,520
You do not need to remind me that
man is not equal to his rhetoric.

762
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:08,120
Our new people talk about openness.

763
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,760
Disarmament. Peace.

764
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,680
Words.

765
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:20,160
You like graveyards, Barley?

766
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:23,800
Look. Here is ours if we fail.

767
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:28,280
Chose a monument.

768
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:45,480
Leave Katya out.
Go with the experts and leave her out.

769
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:49,640
I shall wish a book jacket that is only
letters. No sensational drawings. Yes?

770
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,200
Send the money to a deserving cause.

771
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:55,040
- Dante...
- What is the matter? Are you afraid?

772
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:57,440
Well, of course I'm bloody afraid:

773
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:02,400
Here... the Revolution started.

774
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:08,640
Imagine this place on that day when
the battleship "Aurora" fired that blank shot

775
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:10,880
which signalled the Revolution.

776
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:18,480
The next revolution shall begin with a few
gentle phrases of Johann Sebastian Bach.

777
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:25,240
Or maybe with some of the jazz
you play so beautifully.

778
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:29,800
Yes, a little Sidney Bechet.

779
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:32,520
It's time.

780
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:35,000
<i>(bell tolls)</i>

781
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,720
<i>(phone rings)</i>

782
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:44,160
<i>Da?</i>

783
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,320
<i>(speaks Russian)</i>

784
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:53,760
Got a present for you.
They asked me to give it to you.

785
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:56,760
It tells you how to get in touch with them.
I'll try to...

786
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:00,360
Have you learned nothing?
They are against you, and against me.

787
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,760
Those are not the decent people.

788
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:07,000
How the hell do you know
who the decent people are any more?

789
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:10,480
Come to England. Then you can
tell the world everything you want.

790
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:13,200
You are wearing grey today, Barley.

791
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,800
My father was sent to prison by grey men.

792
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:23,320
He was murdered by men
who wore grey uniforms.

793
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:30,320
Grey men ruined my beautiful profession,
and take care, or they will ruin you too.

794
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:37,240
Will you publish me?

795
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:41,760
Or must I start again for my search
for a decent human being?

796
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,240
No.

797
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:47,320
I'm with you.

798
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:50,240
I believe you're right.

799
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:01,240
I dropped another notebook into your bag.

800
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:05,360
Throw your friends a few bones.

801
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:10,400
Publish me.

802
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:49,640
Barley. Welcome back.

803
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:52,120
Nedski. Why aren't you working?

804
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:56,280
I'm the red carpet.
And the bunting, and the brass band.

805
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:59,240
Oh. You got the notebook.

806
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:04,600
- Good stuff, was it?
- The best. You're the hero of the hour.

807
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:06,680
You're a star.

808
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:10,120
Where's Walter? Off with the boy scouts?

809
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:13,960
Well, he's off the job, I'm afraid.
But he sends his love.

810
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:21,560
<i>(American) The fourth notebook
is a deal-breaker.</i>

811
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:27,320
It's come-to-Jesus time for both sides
now, the hawks and the doves.

812
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:32,680
The Agency has gotta
get off the fence, Russell.

813
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:35,480
<i>(#jazz)</i>

814
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:15,800
Only three weeks old,
and already a classic.

815
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:20,760
Feel the weight of all the expert opinions.

816
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:26,880
- Is there a conclusion?
- Clive, there is a conclusion.

817
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:31,160
Drop it down the toilet,
and your guy with it.

818
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:37,640
Ned?

819
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:46,000
- Is that what "you" think, Russell?
- What "I" think?

820
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:51,040
Well, expert opinion has it that
this notebook was written very quickly,

821
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:55,200
or very slowly, by a man or a woman,
in anger or in jest.

822
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:59,640
The writer was right- or left-handed.
He was a scientist and a non-scientist.

823
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:01,720
What "I" think?

824
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:05,160
For experts, there's no toilet deep enough.

825
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:09,120
Good for you, Russell.

826
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:13,360
The trouble is,
a lot of highly paid favourite sons

827
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:16,720
are in danger of having their
rice bowls broken and going hungry,

828
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:19,840
all on account
of these goddamn notebooks.

829
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:26,360
The Russian military effort is stalled,
the American military effort is stalled.

830
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:31,240
Their rocket motors suck instead of blow,
their ICBMs can't get out of their kennels,

831
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:34,720
their scientists can't do
solid fuel for shit...

832
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:37,920
Our customers don't like to hear that.

833
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:45,160
Jesus Christ. I have to come
all this way to tell you this?

834
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:51,400
And yet here you are.

835
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:54,560
And yet here I am.

836
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:57,920
Clive, Ned, I'll tell you something.

837
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:01,040
I am an honest-to-God glasnostic.

838
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:06,600
I was born a glasnostic. My parents
are old glasnostics from way back.

839
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:10,800
My children will be raised as glasnostics -
although I don't have any.

840
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:16,160
And I really believe that Dante
is a source from glasnost heaven.

841
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:22,320
I can't look away. He'll invade my sleep.

842
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:26,920
And for the rest of my fucking life
I'll be hearing him say

843
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:31,440
"Russell, you had it in your hand.
Ned gave it to you."

844
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:37,200
Honour is due, Ned.

845
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:45,720
- You won't regret it, Russell.
- "You" might.

846
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:48,960
We wanna meet your Mr Barley.

847
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:52,600
In the back room,
with the lights in his eyes.

848
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:16,440
<i>(Russell) Mr Blair,
you have all the attributes.</i>

849
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:19,680
Generosity, wit, courtesy,

850
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:24,280
sang-froid, saxophone and reckless folly.

851
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:29,400
So... what in the hell takes you
to Russia every five minutes?

852
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:33,240
Are you, uh... buying property over there?

853
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:36,520
That's a fair question.

854
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:40,400
Fuck whether it's a fair question.
Just tell us the answer.

855
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:44,760
I love the place.

856
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:46,840
It draws me.

857
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:51,760
It's such a shambles.

858
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:55,480
They try so hard, from so far back...

859
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:59,120
Poor buggers.
They just want to be like us.

860
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:05,760
They have this huge heart
and... huge ignorance.

861
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:09,600
And they always keep their word.

862
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:11,920
Ugh... Acorns:

863
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:15,680
They're gathering acorns
and making coffee from them:

864
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:17,560
That's what they're doing here.

865
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:22,880
Mr Blair, we are buying a Picasso. OK?

866
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,640
You don't mind
an occasional metaphor, do you?

867
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:28,880
- Not at all.
- Good.

868
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:33,520
Some people don't like my metaphors.
I don't know why, but...

869
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:37,800
Anyway, everyone in this room
is buying the same Picasso.

870
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:43,040
It's, uh, very rare.
Medium rare, well done. What the fuck?

871
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:46,560
The bottom-line question is
"Did Picasso paint it?"

872
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:50,400
And you're the man who is selling it to us.

873
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:53,360
It is not my Picasso, Russell.

874
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:58,200
It is not my Picasso.
And I'm not saying it "is" a Picasso.

875
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:01,520
And furthermore, I'm not selling it to you.

876
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:06,520
And lastly, I don't give a fuck
whether you buy it or not.

877
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:21,600
Quinn is army from the anus up.
He likes plain answers.

878
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:25,720
I'll tell Barley.

879
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:31,400
Have you ever had any homosexual
experiences, Mr Blair?

880
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:35,200
Just the usual adolescent hand-held job.

881
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:38,560
Same as yourself, I suppose?

882
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:42,680
- Has this man been fluttered?
- What's that?

883
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:45,760
Lie detector. No, Colonel, he hasn't.

884
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:50,800
Your background is fairly liberal,
isn't it, Mr Blair?

885
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:53,400
- Background?
- Your father.

886
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:58,080
No. My father hated liberals.
He took the communist line mainly.

887
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:01,720
Your father died eight years ago?

888
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:02,760
Yes.

889
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:06,800
Which is about the time your visits
to the Soviet Union became pretty regular.

890
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:10,640
- I hadn't made the connection.
- Have you formed "any" connection

891
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:15,440
with any peaceniks, dissidents
or other unofficial groups of that nature?

892
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:19,960
You meet all sorts.
Jazz people, book people...

893
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:23,160
That's an impossible question. I'm sorry.

894
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:27,800
Well, let me turn that around and ask if
you've made any connection, whatsoever,

895
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:29,840
with any peace people in England?

896
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:34,040
Oh, hundreds, I should think.
You have to stay indoors to avoid them.

897
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:36,440
Are there any musicians
you fraternise with

898
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:41,480
whom you would describe, or who would
describe themselves, as anarchists?

899
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:46,480
Ah. There was a trombone player.

900
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:50,840
Wilfred Baker was his name.

901
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:53,520
He's the only jazz musician I can recall

902
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:57,240
who was completely devoid
of anarchist tendencies.

903
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:03,960
Do you disapprove of the English
social structure, Mr Blair?

904
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:07,760
Absolutely. Give me America every time.

905
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:10,240
- Thank you, Mr Blair.
- Not at all.

906
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:13,960
But you seem to go to Russia
rather more than you come to America.

907
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:16,760
Yes. Because I prefer Russia.

908
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:23,280
It's as corrupt as America, but...
there's less bullshit.

909
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:32,800
He acted like a man who's going
his own way. Wouldn't you say?

910
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:39,480
I'd say he behaved like someone
who didn't need to be careful.

911
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:42,400
He might have.

912
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:47,280
Oh, Renй. Mr Blair likes to have
a bottle of Scotch in his room.

913
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:50,600
After his cricket.

914
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:55,200
- Very good.
- That was nearly a six.

915
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:56,880
Mr Brady, Barley.

916
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:00,080
Looks like you've done
a fine thing, Barley.

917
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:02,880
Anybody say thank you along the way?

918
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,520
No.

919
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:08,440
Did I read somewhere you once played
in the great Ray Noble's band?

920
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:11,200
Ah. A beardless boy in those days, Brady.

921
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:13,920
Wasn't Ray the sweetest man
you ever met?

922
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:15,720
Ray was a prince.

923
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:18,120
Did you ever play chess with him?

924
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:21,680
- As a matter of fact, I did.
- Who won?

925
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:24,760

01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:00,400
Scott Blair.

Yes.

By the Soviets?

941
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:20,320
No.

942

I am operating in collusion

No.

Yes. What do you mean?

945
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:34,440
- Hold it.
- Don't break the rhythm, Mr Blair.

946
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:38,760
We have people do that on purpose
just to shake off a bad question.

947
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:41,840
I am operating on behalf
of the Soviet Union.

948
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:44,920
- No.
- In collusion with Katya Orlova.

949
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:47,960
- No.
- I am the lover of Katya Orlova.

950
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:49,560
No.

951
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:53,000
I am motivated
by my love for Katya Orlova.

952
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:55,200
No.

953
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:03,320
Get rid of him, Clive.

954
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:08,760
He's wrong for us.
Put in a professional. One of our people.

955
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:12,840
If Dante's a good boy,
he gets the jackpot. I'll see to it.

956
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:16,320
A million's no problem.
Ten million's even better.

957
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:19,680
That way Dante's a traitor
our patriots can understand.

958
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:24,400
Dante won't deal with a professional.
He won't be bribed or threatened.

959
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:27,400
He's straight. Do you remember straight?

960
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:31,280
Nobody hired us
for our brotherly love, Ned.

961
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:38,680
Russell.

962
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:44,440
- Brady?
- Clive?

963
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:47,800
Is there a seat on your plane?

964
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:49,880
Of course.

965
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:11,080
Barley?

966
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,840
Barley?

967
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:18,840
You've won:

968
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:24,200
You've beaten their whole apparatus.

969
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:26,880
There'll be no turning back now.

970
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:30,320
Well done, Ned(:) Jolly good show.

971
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:37,000
Well, that's what you want, isn't it?
To go back to Moscow. To see it through.

972
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:41,440
Three cheers for our side.

973
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:52,080
Blair stays, and Langley
are taking over the case.

974
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:54,760
They're preparing
a shopping list for Dante.

975
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:58,720
It'll be the list to end all lists.
A grand-slam questionnaire.

976
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:02,000
Pentagon, Defense, State...
Endorsed by the president.

977
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:04,600
You made them a present of "my" joe?

978
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:08,760
The role of the Russia House
will be respected. Russell values the link.

979
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:12,400
We're taking over Barley's resettlement
and his pension, Ned.

980
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:14,880
You gave away my joe for his pension?

981
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,600
We're on the same bloody side,
aren't we?

982
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:21,840
God, this is a list of questions that could
unlock all the Sov military secrets

983
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:23,960
and win the arms race at a stroke:

984
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:27,480
<i>(Ned) Or lose it. I don't like lists, Clive.</i>

985
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:30,640
<i>Lists tell you too much
about the people who make them.</i>

986
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:33,840
<i>(Bob) I think you'll enjoy our facility.</i>

987
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:36,880
Bloody marvellous.
Blair's tapes encrypted,

988
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:41,240
bounced by satellite to London,
then decrypted - all in minutes.

989
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:55,760
Ah, Vladimir.

990
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:59,360
You know my partner, JP Henziger?
No, you don't? You should.

991
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:02,640
- Leonard Wicklow, my associate.
- Jack Henziger.

992
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:04,680
Spikey: They let you in again?

993
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:07,560
- Not bankrupt yet?
- No. Close, but no cigar. Here.

994
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:10,520
- Party on Thursday. Live music.
- Hey.

995
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:14,200
Bit early in the day even for me, George.

996
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:16,360
Er, Leonard Wicklow, JP Henziger.

997
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:18,960
- Brought your saxophone?
- But of course.

998
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:24,480
Alik. A cordial invitation from
Potomac Blair to a party on Thursday.

999
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:27,320
- So what was so important in Leningrad?
- Come on.

1000
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:30,240
You don't care about Leningrad, do you?

1001
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:32,600
I'm sorry I disappeared. Here.

1002
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:36,880
If she was young and beautiful,
I forgive you.

1003
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:44,080
It is so good, Barley.
Really, it is so good to see you.

1004
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:48,040
Welcome to Moscow again.
Welcome to the book fair.

1005
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:50,440
To hell with the book fair.

1006
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:19,560
This is too beautiful to wear.

1007
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:39,920
She is asking... are you married?

1008
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:43,160
No. Not at present.

1009
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:46,560
But tell her that I'm always open to offers.

1010
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:50,840
<i>(girl speaks in Russian)</i>

Baseball, cricket...

1014
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:24,880
What's he saying?

1015
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:28,480
Matvey assures me lapta is the origin

1016
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:31,680
of American baseball
and your English cricket.

1017
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:34,920
He believes it was introduced to you
by Russian immigrants.

1018
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:38,640
Well, if that's true,
it's the end of the British Empire.

1019
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:54,920
Now, my news.

1020
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:58,320
After your meeting with Yakov
he missed his next phone call.

1021
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:00,480
I was very worried. But it is all right.

1022
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:04,880
Yakov wrote me a long letter.
He was ill, but he has recovered.

1023
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:09,760
He will make a special visit to Moscow
during the book fair to meet you.

1024
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:12,320
- How was he ill?
- With "gipetit."

1025
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:17,360
I... "Prasti." Sorry. Er, hepatitis?

1026
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:19,680
I will read it to you.

1027
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:22,680
It arrived eight days ago.
Igor telephoned at my house.

1028
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:25,800
- Who's lgor?
- A trusted friend of Yakov.

1029
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:30,520
He telephoned. He said "I have some
medicine for you." Medicine is a letter.

1030
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:34,440
I thought he didn't have
any trusted friends except you.

1031
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,760
What does he do, this lgor?

1032
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:41,080
He is a scientist like Yakov,
at one of the ministries.

1033
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:45,440
What does it matter? Do you wish me
to translate Yakov's letter or not?

1034
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:47,520
Go on.

1035
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:52,760
He is in a special hospital,
perhaps in a special town.

1036
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:54,320
What town?

1037
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:59,280
Some of our towns have no names,
even today. Only postal numbers.

1038
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:04,600
"My darling Katya..."

1039
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:13,720
He writes love talk. I shall not translate.

1040
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:16,520
Does he usually do that?

1041
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:19,880
What "usually"?
It is not usually he writes to me.

1042
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:22,360
Ah, now we come to you.

1043
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:33,640
"Please tell our good friend that I shall
try my best to see him during his visit."

1044
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:38,840
"I will bring more material. If he has
a message for me, he must tell you."

1045
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:43,280
Do you have a message?

1046
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:45,760
No. No.

1047
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:49,480
"Tell him to bring all further questions,

1048
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:53,680
because after this I do not wish
to answer any more questions."

1049
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:57,880
"Tell him his list should be final and..."

1050
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:02,240
Like... complete.

1051
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:04,840
Comprehensive?

1052
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:08,040
Yes. Comprehensive.

1053
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:10,400
Com... Comprehensive.

1054
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:13,080
Full marks.

1055
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:26,840
He says "Please bring
a sample page of translation,

1056
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:29,480
but in print, please, if you can."

1057
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:34,160
"Tell me publishing dates.
Which is the best season?"

1058
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:35,280
Um...

1059
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:38,720
"Please make your suggestions
for a title."

1060
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:44,680
"Will there be an introduction to the
book? Who will write the... digest?"

1061
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,240
Er, the blurb.

1062
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:52,480
Blurb?

1063
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:54,560
Yes, the blurb.

1064
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:59,080
Blurb? :

1065
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:01,200
Oh:

01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:03,400
<i>(girl speaks Russian)</i>

1067
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:07,760
Er, it's a war wound.
It's very good. You must tell her.

1068
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:10,360
- You tell her.
- Fantastic.

1069
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:32,000
When do you speak to Yakov again?

1070
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:38,600
You cannot come to the hospital, Barley.
It is not safe.

1071
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:42,520
If it's not safe for "me,"
then it's not safe for "you."

1072
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:48,080
- How does he end his letter?
- That is not for you.

1073
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:52,600
- More love talk, hm?
- Barley, I think it is clear to hedgehog

1074
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:55,280
that you are being a little childish.

1075
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:00,240
Which hedgehog?

1076
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:03,320
Why does he write like that?

1077
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:08,480
He is lonely. He exaggerates
his feelings. It is normal.

1078
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:13,440
Yeah.

1079
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:15,840
It's normal.

1080
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:36,360
That's it: No more: No more fucking tapes:

1081
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:51,440
Final and comprehensive list. Why?

1082
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:54,480
He's nervous. Why not?

1083
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:57,280
Maybe I don't mind the list.

1084
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:59,960
Maybe I mind him
writing her chatty letters.

1085
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:02,040
People do when they've been ill.

1086
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:06,440
Maybe I mind the red car and
the white car. You saw the watch report.

1087
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:08,960
And lgor. Igor who? Lgor when?

1088

Ned, Ned, Ned, Ned, Ned:

<i>Katya, Katya.</i>

1092
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:42,960
Did you know Agatha Christie?
Matvey is crazy for detective fiction.

1093
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:46,000
Alas, Agatha and I were never introduced.

1094

Raymond Chandler,
Dorothy Sayers, Conan Doyle...

01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:32,480
The Germans were four kilometres
from Leningrad on the south side.

1105
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:34,880
- I love you.
- You can still see...

1106
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:41,360
the marks of the machine-gun fire
in the old buildings in the outskirts.

1107
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:42,760
I love you.

1108
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:46,280
All my failings were
preparations for meeting you.

1109
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:52,160
The city refused to... accept defeat.

- Shostakovich still composed music...
- It's like nothing I have ever known.

1111

It's...

1112
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:04,600
unselfish love. Grown-up love.

1113
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:06,960
- You know it is.
- Barley, please.

1114
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:09,120
It's mature, absolute,

1115
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:13,080
thrilling love.

1116
01:27:14,720 --> 01:27:17,480
You have bewitched my family.

1117
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:23,720
My children think all you British are now
Santa Claus in beautiful tweed clothes.

1118
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:28,640
There's no Santa Claus.
And nobody is what he seems.

1119
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:30,720
Except you.

1120
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:35,400
Why do you want to take away my rights?
Go and sit down.

1121
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:47,400
I hope you are not being frivolous, Barley.
My life now only has room for truth.

1122
01:27:58,160 --> 01:27:59,960
- What are you doing?
- Shh.

1123
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:38,440
I'm with you.

1124
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:04,360
"(whispers)" I know it now.

1125
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:46,280
A final and comprehensive list.

1126
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:49,680
One chance, then close down.

1127
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:52,080
Why?

1128
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:55,080
I really think you should get some sleep.

1129
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:58,360
- I don't think I'm tired.
- Oh, I think you are.

1130
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:00,720
I think you're tired as hell.

1131
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:05,200
If the Sovs were playing Dante back at us,
they wouldn't close him down.

1132
01:30:05,320 --> 01:30:08,680
You wouldn't close him down
if you were Sov, would you?

1133
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:11,040
I might have to
if my methods were Russian.

1134
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:12,720
Why?

1135
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:16,640
Because Dante may not
be presentable any more.

1136
01:30:17,320 --> 01:30:21,920
He may not be able to use the telephone.
He may not be able to use a spoon.

1137
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:25,880
He may be dead.

1138
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:30,600
Dante is going to phone Katya
at the hospital today.

1139
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:34,440
If he does that, will you shut the fuck up?

1140
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:38,000
Or stay out of my operation?

1141
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:45,120
"(whispers)" You must be very quiet.

1142
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:50,240
If the children come, we must dress
and we must be very serious.

1143
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:53,200
I'll tell them I love you.

1144
01:30:53,720 --> 01:30:55,680
I shall not interpret.

1145
01:30:56,760 --> 01:30:58,720
Can I tell "you?"

1146
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:01,360
If you are quiet.

1147
01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:03,440
Will you interpret?

1148
01:31:09,080 --> 01:31:11,440
You are my only country now.

Dante's coming to Moscow on Friday.
He's borrowing that apartment.

- Well done. What time?
- 1800.

Anything unusual?

1173
01:34:49,200 --> 01:34:53,840
No. Nothing I couldn't handle.
But Katya's not as tough as she thought.

1174
01:34:54,840 --> 01:34:57,840
Wound herself up a bit, I think,
waiting for that phone call.

1175
01:34:57,960 --> 01:35:02,000
But I gave her a cup of tea
and held her hand for a bit.

1176
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:06,360
Well done.

1177
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:10,520
Well done indeed.

1178
01:35:24,680 --> 01:35:26,440
Leo, good to see you.

1179
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:28,760
How's Olga? Still eating?

1180
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:30,640
How's your dog, Barley?

1181
01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:33,720
Arkady. I haven't got a dog.
Why do you ask?

1182
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:37,920
Because it's safer to discuss one's dog,
I would say, than one's friends.

1183
01:35:38,040 --> 01:35:40,160
Getting careless in our excitement, huh?

1184

The questions will float to the surface.

1234
01:40:30,640 --> 01:40:33,000
Uh, make sure you bring it back.

1235
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:37,360
We think the whole thing
will take two hours. Three, for luck.

1236
01:40:37,480 --> 01:40:40,600
Tell him you want a date
for a final meeting to fill in the blanks.

1237
01:40:40,720 --> 01:40:44,760
And when you want to leave,
pull the curtain. We'll pick you up.

1238
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:46,400
How's that?

1239
01:40:46,520 --> 01:40:48,480
Good.

1240
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:52,720
Give this to Ned, will you?
Just in case something goes wrong.

1241
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:56,000
Nothing's going wrong.

1242
01:41:15,320 --> 01:41:18,360
That's it over there. Second from the right.

1243
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,160
You'll be fine from here, Barley.

1244
01:41:34,600 --> 01:41:36,560
Fingers crossed, Jack.

1245
01:41:37,280 --> 01:41:39,240
Cheerio.

1246
01:42:04,240 --> 01:42:06,200
Thank you.

1247
01:42:12,680 --> 01:42:16,360
Sir, the shopping list...
It's only questions, isn't it?

1248
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:19,520
- It wouldn't tell anyone anything?
- Everything.

1249
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:23,280
It would tell what we know
by telling what we "don't" know.

1250
01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:26,360
And it would tell
what we would most like to know.

1251
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:30,040
If the Sovs get the list, we might as well
have published the notebooks,

1252
01:42:30,160 --> 01:42:32,600
just as Barley promised Dante.

1253
01:42:36,680 --> 01:42:38,880
Yes, I "do" know.

1254
01:42:40,680 --> 01:42:43,280
Barley's made a deal.

1255
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:46,920
<i>He's keeping his promise to Dante
in his own way.</i>

1256
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:49,440
<i>And he's trying to save Katya.</i>

1257
01:42:49,560 --> 01:42:51,640
- He's giving them the list:
- Come on, Ned.

1258
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:54,880
The Sovs are just waiting
for Barley to give it to them.

1259
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,800
Jesus Christ:

1260
01:43:03,400 --> 01:43:06,000
- Brock, signal the truck.
- Don't:

1261
01:43:06,120 --> 01:43:07,840
- Signal Paddy. Abort.
- Don't:

1262
01:43:13,720 --> 01:43:15,040
<i>(beep)</i>

1263
01:43:17,360 --> 01:43:19,480
Looking good:

1264
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:22,240
And he's coming back smiling.

1265
01:43:22,720 --> 01:43:25,160
And "you" can take a long, long vacation.

1266
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:29,200
My joe's crossed over.

1267
01:44:24,120 --> 01:44:25,680
<i>(Russell) He went in.</i>

1268
01:44:26,240 --> 01:44:28,240
He never came out.

1269
01:44:28,360 --> 01:44:30,320
About seven hours.

1270
01:44:30,880 --> 01:44:32,560
Yes, sir.

1271
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:41,840
Shit city, Ned.

1272
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:51,760
Honour is due.

1273
01:45:01,320 --> 01:45:05,080
Well, folks, better put
the chairs back on the tables.

1274
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:11,000
Till next time.

1275
01:45:25,320 --> 01:45:27,640
<i>(Russian man)
Yekaterina Borisovna Orlova.</i>

1276
01:45:27,760 --> 01:45:29,720
<i>(Barley) Yes. Katya.</i>

1277
01:45:29,840 --> 01:45:35,520
<i>- The letter was signed "Katya"?
- No, just the initial. "Your loving K."</i>

1278
01:45:35,880 --> 01:45:39,480
<i>British Intelligence showed you
the letter for the first time in Lisbon?</i>

1279
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:40,160
<i>Yes.</i>

1280
01:45:40,280 --> 01:45:44,680
<i>And it referred to your first meeting
with Savelyev, whom you know as Dante?</i>

1281
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:47,040
<i>Yes. At Peredelkino.</i>

1282
01:45:47,160 --> 01:45:49,120
<i>But Mrs Orlova was not at Peredelkino?</i>

1283
01:45:49,240 --> 01:45:53,600
<i>- As I keep telling you, I didn't meet her...
- Please. Allow me.</i>

1284
01:45:54,360 --> 01:45:57,840
<i>Did Savelyev arrive at Peredelkino
by himself or with others?</i>

1285
01:45:57,960 --> 01:46:00,600
<i>I don't know. Why don't you ask him?</i>

1286
01:46:00,920 --> 01:46:03,800
<i>Unfortunately,
Professor Savelyev is dead.</i>

1287
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:06,400
<i>He became very ill with hepatitis.</i>

1288
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:11,240
<i>A great loss to the Soviet
scientific community.</i>

1289
01:46:12,280 --> 01:46:14,080
<i>We all mourn him.</i>

1290
01:46:17,800 --> 01:46:19,760
Me too.

1291
01:46:21,240 --> 01:46:24,600
I have nothing further
to add to what I have said.

1292
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:28,160
You have the shopping list -
payment in full.

1293
01:46:29,120 --> 01:46:31,680
Yes. The celebrated list.

1294
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:36,400
We have a deal.
I expect you to honour that deal.

1295
01:46:37,320 --> 01:46:40,320
Yes, I'm talking about honour,
not ideology.

1296
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:45,800
I've left a letter behind me just in case
"they" don't know the difference.

1297
01:46:51,040 --> 01:46:53,440
<i>Tell me about the letter.</i>

1298
01:46:56,400 --> 01:46:59,640
<i>"Dear Nedski, change of plan, old chum."</i>

1299
01:47:01,160 --> 01:47:03,400
<i>"Sorry I couldn't let you know."</i>

1300
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:06,400
<i>"I thought you'd be onto me
if anyone was. "</i>

1301
01:47:07,640 --> 01:47:10,120
<i>"But perhaps you taught me too well."</i>

1302
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:14,160
<i>"Anyway, Dante is blown,
as you would say. "</i>

1303
01:47:16,160 --> 01:47:18,440
<i>"His letter to Katya was a fake."</i>

1304
01:47:19,360 --> 01:47:23,000
<i>"His phone call to the hospital
was KGB-controlled. "</i>

1305
01:47:23,640 --> 01:47:26,640
<i>"But Dante and Katya
had worked out a code. "</i>

1306
01:47:27,640 --> 01:47:29,840
What did he say?

1307
01:47:29,960 --> 01:47:31,560
Tell me.

1308
01:47:31,680 --> 01:47:35,400
He is taken. Yakov is taken.

1309
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:38,160
<i>"If he was caught,
he called her by the wrong name. "</i>

1310
01:47:38,280 --> 01:47:40,440
He used the wrong name.

1311
01:47:41,400 --> 01:47:45,680
If we are safe, he calls me Alina.
Lf... if he is caught, Maria.

1312
01:47:45,800 --> 01:47:47,920
He called me Maria.

1313
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:51,920
He was telling me we are dead.

1314
01:47:52,520 --> 01:47:54,480
<i>(sobs)</i>

1315
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,080
Give me the key.

1316
01:48:05,240 --> 01:48:09,800
<i>"So there we were. And I was thinking
'Why haven't they arrested us?"'</i>

1317
01:48:12,200 --> 01:48:14,480
<i>"It took me a while to work it out."</i>

1318
01:48:14,600 --> 01:48:18,000
<i>"But of course:
They wanted the shopping list. "</i>

1319
01:48:18,840 --> 01:48:20,560
<i>"So there was the crunch:</i>

1320
01:48:20,680 --> 01:48:25,600
<i>To save your precious secrets,
or to trade them for Katya and her family. "</i>

1321
01:48:25,720 --> 01:48:28,320
<i>"The easiest decision I ever made."</i>

1322
01:48:29,040 --> 01:48:32,680
<i>"And if you wouldn't have done the same,
then you've learned nothing. "</i>

1323
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:34,400
<i>"Dante was right."</i>

1324
01:48:34,520 --> 01:48:40,400
<i>"The grey men are keeping alive the arms
race, which nobody is supposed to want. "</i>

1325
01:48:43,120 --> 01:48:47,200
<i>"It's all over for the secrets game.
Your day is done, old boy. "</i>

1326
01:48:47,320 --> 01:48:49,520
<i>"Publish and be safe."</i>

1327
01:48:50,320 --> 01:48:54,200
I need to betray my country,
and I haven't got much time.

1328
01:48:55,640 --> 01:49:00,080
And don't tell me you don't know
who to get in touch with. Just do it, hm?

1329
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:08,560
I want to meet them in the morning
and agree a contract. All right?

1330
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:14,720
<i>"I did my best for you, Ned."</i>

1331
01:49:14,840 --> 01:49:18,040
<i>"But now I have to do my best
for Dante, and for Katya. "</i>

1332
01:49:19,560 --> 01:49:21,760
Smile. You must smile.

1333
01:49:21,880 --> 01:49:25,000
They're watching us.
Your side and my side.

1334
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,240
We're going to beat them both.

1335
01:49:32,360 --> 01:49:35,320
I can't save Yakov. Nothing can.

1336
01:49:38,280 --> 01:49:40,320
But you're safe.

1337
01:49:40,440 --> 01:49:43,520
The children are safe.
Uncle Matvey's safe.

1338
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:50,000
I love you.

1339
01:49:50,680 --> 01:49:52,960
And I won't let you down.

1340
01:50:03,800 --> 01:50:08,560
<i>"It was my first good contract.
Real people for unreal arguments. "</i>

1341
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:12,400
<i>"I got everything I wanted,</i>

1342
01:50:12,520 --> 01:50:16,600
<i>down to a safe passage for Wicklow,
Henziger and the others. "</i>

1343
01:50:18,720 --> 01:50:22,000
<i>"No doubt there'll be
hell to pay at your end. "</i>

1344
01:50:23,160 --> 01:50:26,480
<i>"But you shouldn't open
other people's letters. "</i>

1345
01:50:27,200 --> 01:50:30,160
<i>"Love, and luck. Barley."</i>

1346
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:36,440
What about Russell?

1347
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:39,120
Russell's a survivor.

1348
01:50:40,080 --> 01:50:43,680
Rumour has it that the shopping list
was really a brilliant deception,

1349
01:50:43,800 --> 01:50:46,280
planted on the Russians
by our clever Russell,

1350
01:50:46,400 --> 01:50:48,840
who also started the rumour.

1351
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:53,800
If he can get the Sovs to believe it,
everything's back to square one.

1352
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:56,240
Dante need never have bothered.

1353
01:50:57,480 --> 01:50:59,440
And Barley?

1354
01:51:00,240 --> 01:51:02,360
Oh, Barley.

1355
01:51:02,680 --> 01:51:05,800
<i>He's home free. Back in Lisbon.</i>

1356
01:51:05,920 --> 01:51:08,240
It's not a large flat, of course.

1357
01:51:09,040 --> 01:51:13,240
But by Moscow standards...
We'll all squeeze in.

1358
01:51:14,080 --> 01:51:16,480
Still backing your Russia, Barley?

1359
01:51:17,320 --> 01:51:19,280
Well, we'll see.

1360
01:51:19,400 --> 01:51:24,560
You know, I chose this flat because
I like to watch the ships come in.

1361
01:51:25,680 --> 01:51:28,800
I must have known
that one day it would be my ship.

1362
01:51:29,640 --> 01:51:32,640
And you think that Katya's
going to be on it?

1363
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:35,920
Well, perhaps it's your due.

1364
01:51:36,040 --> 01:51:40,080
It took some guts. And you seem
to think you did the decent thing.

1365
01:51:43,440 --> 01:51:45,560
Good luck, Barley.

1366
01:52:11,920 --> 01:52:13,880
Katya:

1367
01:52:17,040 --> 01:52:19,000
Come on:

1368
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,640
Come on, Katya: Come on:
