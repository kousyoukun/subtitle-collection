1
00:01:48,774 --> 00:01:51,577
Yekaterina Orlova.
Katya?

2
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,294
Never heard of her.

3
00:01:53,422 --> 00:01:58,632
The patronymic's Borisovna.
Katya Borisovna Orlova.

4
00:01:58,753 --> 00:02:01,477
- Have a think, Barley.
- Don't know a Katya.

5
00:02:01,598 --> 00:02:03,752
Never screwed one,
never flirted with one,

6
00:02:03,881 --> 00:02:07,278
never proposed to one,
never even married one.

7
00:02:07,407 --> 00:02:10,211
What is she, the usual fat-arsed frump?

8
00:02:11,775 --> 00:02:17,419
She visited the British Council's
audio fair in Moscow exactly a week ago.

9
00:02:17,547 --> 00:02:19,461
Audio fair?

10
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,668
Cassettes.
Books of the bloody future.

11
00:02:22,796 --> 00:02:26,956
- So why didn't you go?
- I can go. I can not go.

12
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:30,127
I'm my own man. But you wouldn't
know anything about that.

13
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:35,288
Crap, Barley. You rented
a stand, booked your hotel, your flight...

14
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:37,618
Why didn't you show up?

15
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:42,425
I have a board.
I have family shareholders.

16
00:02:42,552 --> 00:02:47,238
The firm's having withdrawal pains at the
bank, if it's any of your bloody business.

17
00:02:47,362 --> 00:02:49,321
It is.

18
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:55,525
Tell me something.
Do you know Niki Landau?

19
00:02:57,019 --> 00:03:00,176
Excuse me. Do you know
Mr Bartholomew Scott Blair?

20
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:05,024
Yeah, I know Niki. Short-arse Polish
cockney sales rep. Goes at it like a rabbit.

21
00:03:05,153 --> 00:03:07,831
Barley? Sure, I know Barley.

22
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:11,321
House of Abercrombie and Blair,
publishers, drunk or sober.

23
00:03:11,445 --> 00:03:13,325
A gent. One of the best.

24
00:03:13,449 --> 00:03:16,606
I must speak to Mr Scott Blair.
It is very urgent.

25
00:03:16,736 --> 00:03:18,331
He's not here, darling.

26
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:20,817
But he was not here yesterday.

27
00:03:20,943 --> 00:03:26,185
Mr Scott Blair never came. He's absent.
AWOL. Not among those present. Sorry.

28
00:03:26,312 --> 00:03:29,709
Irritating little sod.
I'm quite fond of him really.

29
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,284
I have an important manuscript for him.
It is for Mr Blair. Only for Mr Blair.

30
00:03:34,407 --> 00:03:39,331
Listen, I'm trying to make a living here.
And not for Mr Blair, love him as I may.

31
00:03:39,456 --> 00:03:43,298
Might one inquire
why she should ask Niki about you?

32
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:46,263
I don't know. I don't know her.

33
00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:48,589
So you know Niki,
but not Katya?

34
00:03:48,794 --> 00:03:51,266
Oh, now you're getting it, old boy.

35
00:03:54,524 --> 00:03:57,521
- Is that Scotch over there?
- Help yourself.

36
00:03:59,813 --> 00:04:01,773
Hold everything.

37
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,556
OK.

38
00:04:41,049 --> 00:04:43,966
You must be very kind and help me.

39
00:04:44,936 --> 00:04:49,302
A Russian friend of mine
has written an important novel.

40
00:04:49,426 --> 00:04:52,741
Its message is important
for all of mankind.

41
00:04:52,871 --> 00:04:54,022
Nice.

42
00:04:54,154 --> 00:04:58,678
In spite of glasnost, my friend's
novel cannot yet be published...

43
00:05:01,045 --> 00:05:02,242
in the Soviet Union.

44
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:07,167
Mr Scott Blair has undertaken
to publish it... with discretion.

45
00:05:07,298 --> 00:05:09,451
Don't worry. With Abercrombie and Blair,

46
00:05:09,582 --> 00:05:13,902
your friend's book is virtually guaranteed
to appear in total secrecy.

47
00:05:15,913 --> 00:05:22,445
If you love peace, please,
take this to England to Mr Scott Blair.

48
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:27,087
- It is a gift of trust.
- It is better that you smile.

49
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,895
- Excuse me?
- Smile.

50
00:05:30,019 --> 00:05:33,655
This is Anglo-Soviet cultural exchange.
We smile, we exchange culture.

51
00:05:33,787 --> 00:05:37,068
Looking scared is something different.
Got it in there, have we?

52
00:05:37,193 --> 00:05:40,509
This is dangerous for you.
You must believe in what you are doing.

53
00:05:40,638 --> 00:05:42,792
Smile.

54
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:46,161
We smile, we kiss. Formal Russian kiss.

55
00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:48,248
That's right.

56
00:05:48,894 --> 00:05:54,695
Now we've done it. You have brought me
an official farewell gift from...

57
00:05:55,426 --> 00:05:58,708
October Publishing
on the last day of the fair.

58
00:05:58,832 --> 00:06:03,630
And I have given you Shakespeare's
Sonnets for Careful Drivers.

59
00:06:06,086 --> 00:06:09,242
Would you... like
a nice dinner out somewhere?

60
00:06:11,014 --> 00:06:13,248
It is not convenient.

61
00:06:15,783 --> 00:06:17,937
Thank you.

62
00:06:18,067 --> 00:06:22,706
You can't think of any reason
why a book editor called Katya Orlova

63
00:06:22,836 --> 00:06:26,357
should risk her neck
to send you a manuscript?

64
00:06:33,454 --> 00:06:34,777
Barley?

65
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:41,059
Who said... "risk her neck"?

66
00:06:41,951 --> 00:06:43,911
I did.

67
00:06:45,998 --> 00:06:48,152
- Must be quite a book.
- It is.

68
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:51,361
- May I see it?
- Let's begin with the letter.

69
00:06:54,054 --> 00:06:58,213
"Personal. For Mr Bartholomew
Scott Blair. Urgent."

70
00:06:58,341 --> 00:07:02,627
We'd like to find out why a woman
you don't know should send you a letter

71
00:07:02,749 --> 00:07:06,989
beginning "My beloved Barley",
and sign herself "Your loving K".

72
00:07:07,117 --> 00:07:09,511
She's potty. Certifiable.

73
00:07:10,844 --> 00:07:12,725
Where is this manuscript?

74
00:07:12,848 --> 00:07:15,650
- That's none of your business.
- Like hell it isn't.

75
00:07:15,772 --> 00:07:17,767
She sent it to me as a publisher.

76
00:07:18,257 --> 00:07:22,463
- It's a bloody sight more mine than yours.
- Please calm down.

77
00:07:23,146 --> 00:07:25,345
It's in safe hands, Barley.

78
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:29,627
The manuscript was in three notebooks.

79
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:34,922
When Niki couldn't find you in London,
he had the sense to bring them to us.

80
00:07:36,491 --> 00:07:39,773
The first notebook is worthless,
scientifically speaking.

81
00:07:39,898 --> 00:07:40,695
Oh?

82
00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:44,819
Peacenik manifestos, slogans,
poems, quotations.

83
00:07:44,946 --> 00:07:48,388
It has psychological interest, Minister,
in so far as the writer sounds...

84
00:07:48,513 --> 00:07:50,632
Absolutely barking.

85
00:07:50,756 --> 00:07:54,359
- Would you say?
- It's not a medical term, sir.

86
00:07:54,484 --> 00:07:56,364
Unstable, perhaps.

87
00:07:56,487 --> 00:07:59,803
- As for notebooks two and three?
- Genuine science.

88
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:02,487
Written by someone in the business.
No question.

89
00:08:02,618 --> 00:08:03,895
The business?

90
00:08:04,021 --> 00:08:09,743
Destruction paths, payloads, aim points,
bias, rate of burn, trajectories, telemetry.

91
00:08:09,872 --> 00:08:13,348
Of course, it doesn't necessarily
describe the true state of affairs.

92
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:15,598
What the hell does it purport to describe?

93
00:08:15,722 --> 00:08:20,567
In a nutshell, the Soviet's strategic
capability for waging nuclear war.

94
00:08:22,174 --> 00:08:24,819
And addressed to boozy Barley Blair.

95
00:08:25,461 --> 00:08:29,346
Well, if it's strategic, we can't
evaluate it without the Americans.

96
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:31,862
So it's their baby, not ours.

97
00:08:32,954 --> 00:08:37,113
- Throw Scott Blair to the Americans.
- Unfortunately, we haven't found him yet.

98
00:08:54,874 --> 00:08:57,109
Eureka! We've got him.

99
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,718
A Lisbon bank account, my dears!

100
00:09:01,366 --> 00:09:04,921
- We've got him.
- Lisbon.

101
00:09:06,535 --> 00:09:10,856
- Why did you run away?
- Run away? I own a flat here.

102
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:13,867
Why Lisbon, Barley?

103
00:09:13,989 --> 00:09:16,110
Why Langley, Bob?

104
00:09:16,915 --> 00:09:18,749
You brought a woman?

105
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:22,958
What's it to you if I brought a woman,
a man or a fuckin' Muscovy duck?

106
00:09:23,486 --> 00:09:26,724
What do you do with yourself
in Lisbon, Barley?

107
00:09:26,853 --> 00:09:29,736
Well, I was having a drink.

108
00:09:30,099 --> 00:09:32,333
Until I was interrupted.

109
00:09:38,594 --> 00:09:40,510
- Mr Blair?
- Eh?

110
00:09:40,638 --> 00:09:45,516
I believe I'm addressing Mr Bartholomew
Scott Blair. Yes? Correct?

111
00:09:45,648 --> 00:09:48,326
- Yes.
- I'm Merrydew. I'm from the embassy.

112
00:09:48,452 --> 00:09:52,452
We received a rather urgent
message for you over our link.

113
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:55,258
Are you trying to tell me
someone's dead, old boy?

114
00:09:55,384 --> 00:09:58,383
No. That would be consular.
I'm commercial.

115
00:09:59,954 --> 00:10:03,316
Well, I never knew an honest debt
that couldn't wait till Monday.

116
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,643
Loosen your girdle, Merrydew.
Have a drink with the unwashed.

117
00:10:06,766 --> 00:10:11,451
I say, Blair, the man's the Queen's
emissary, for Christ's sake.

118
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:27,963
Have they moved the embassy, or are you
hijacking me? What's going on, tubby?

119
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:31,481
- I'm commercial. Strictly commercial.
- Mr Blair, sir?

120
00:10:37,542 --> 00:10:39,696
My name's Ned.

121
00:10:39,827 --> 00:10:42,106
I'm about to move the goal posts.

122
00:10:42,231 --> 00:10:47,440
There's no urgent message. There's no
crisis in your affairs - beyond the usual.

123
00:10:47,561 --> 00:10:49,634
I'm from British Intelligence.

124
00:10:49,765 --> 00:10:51,919
Come and meet the others.

125
00:10:55,695 --> 00:10:57,736
This is Clive. This is Walter.

126
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:02,224
Over here is Bob, who is almost family.
Meet Barley, everyone.

127
00:11:02,348 --> 00:11:05,186
- Hello, Barley!
- Proud to know you, Barley.

128
00:11:05,313 --> 00:11:09,029
I'm the odd man out here. I work
for the Central Intelligence Agency,

129
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:13,446
which, as you probably know, is based
in Langley in the state of Virginia.

130
00:11:13,568 --> 00:11:16,452
Let's have some fun. Let's do some good.

131
00:11:16,574 --> 00:11:18,648
Now isn't that jolly?

132
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:23,504
So, where are we all off to?
Nicaragua? Chile? Iran?

133
00:11:23,627 --> 00:11:26,225
Or are we just assassinating
some local nuisance?

134
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,917
Don't rant. Sit down.

135
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,201
Perhaps you can tell us
what this letter's all about.

136
00:11:49,114 --> 00:11:52,191
- Recognise the handwriting?
- Read it slowly.

137
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,712
Take all the time in the world, Barley.

138
00:11:56,407 --> 00:11:58,081
She's barmy.

139
00:12:01,817 --> 00:12:04,131
Who is she?

140
00:12:04,261 --> 00:12:07,145
Yekaterina Orlova. Katya?

141
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:11,867
- Never heard of her.
- The patronymic's Borisovna.

142
00:12:11,995 --> 00:12:16,680
Katya Borisovna Orlova.
Have a think, Barley.

143
00:12:16,804 --> 00:12:19,243
I don't know a Katya. Never screwed one,

144
00:12:19,369 --> 00:12:23,575
never flirted with one, never proposed
to one, never even married one.

145
00:12:23,697 --> 00:12:26,614
What is she, the usual fat-arsed frump?

146
00:12:26,742 --> 00:12:30,789
So, she wrote you a letter
signed "Your loving K",

147
00:12:31,832 --> 00:12:36,436
- and you tell me you don't know her?
- I told you. I never met the hag.

148
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,634
She's off her tree.

149
00:12:39,846 --> 00:12:42,000
She wasn't even there.

150
00:12:42,731 --> 00:12:45,648
- Where?
- At Peredelkino.

151
00:12:45,978 --> 00:12:48,257
It's a Soviet writers' village.

152
00:12:48,382 --> 00:12:52,986
They value their writers. The ones
who behave get their own dachas.

153
00:12:53,712 --> 00:12:56,071
I was lucky enough to be a guest.

154
00:12:56,758 --> 00:12:58,796
When was this?

155
00:12:58,921 --> 00:13:01,315
Three or four months ago.
One of my trips.

156
00:13:01,446 --> 00:13:03,645
But there wasn't any Katya.

157
00:13:04,011 --> 00:13:06,576
- What happened?
- I was brilliant.

158
00:13:06,696 --> 00:13:09,260
- Yes?
- Oh, yes.

159
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:13,666
How to save the world between
lunch and dinner. I was flying.

160
00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:17,791
I believe in the new Russia.
You may not, but I do.

161
00:13:17,917 --> 00:13:22,794
20 years ago, it was just a pipe dream.
Today, it's our only hope.

162
00:13:24,448 --> 00:13:29,167
We thought we could bankrupt you
by raising the stakes in the arms race.

163
00:13:29,296 --> 00:13:31,291
Gambling with the fate of the human race.

164
00:13:31,421 --> 00:13:34,863
Barley, you won your gamble.
Nuclear peace for 40 years.

165
00:13:34,987 --> 00:13:36,709
Oh, rubbish. What peace?

166
00:13:36,831 --> 00:13:41,116
Ask the Czechs, the Vietnamese,
the Koreans. Ask the Afghans.

167
00:13:41,239 --> 00:13:45,604
No. If there is to be hope,
we must all betray our countries.

168
00:13:46,127 --> 00:13:50,927
We have to save each other,
because all victims are equal.

169
00:13:51,057 --> 00:13:53,815
And none is more equal than others.

170
00:13:54,824 --> 00:13:58,220
It's everyone's duty to start the avalanche.

171
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,991
A heroic thought, Barley.

172
00:14:00,113 --> 00:14:02,790
Listen, nowadays you have
to think like a hero

173
00:14:02,918 --> 00:14:06,440
just to behave like
a merely decent human being.

174
00:14:10,252 --> 00:14:13,054
And did you believe this nonsense?

175
00:14:13,177 --> 00:14:16,300
I don't know. I believe it when I say it.

176
00:14:16,984 --> 00:14:19,219
But you've got to be there.

177
00:14:20,792 --> 00:14:25,236
You're taking a leak
in some filthy public urinal,

178
00:14:25,359 --> 00:14:29,440
and the man in the next stall leans across
and asks you about God, or Kafka,

179
00:14:29,567 --> 00:14:32,370
or freedom versus responsibility.

180
00:14:32,492 --> 00:14:36,972
So you tell him. Because you know.
Because you're from the West.

181
00:14:38,063 --> 00:14:42,349
And before you've finished shaking your
dick, you think "What a great country."

182
00:14:42,471 --> 00:14:44,909
That's why I love them.

183
00:14:45,035 --> 00:14:47,314
And they're very fond of me.

184
00:14:49,043 --> 00:14:55,243
Anyway... later we talked about jazz,
and I played some.

185
00:14:55,855 --> 00:14:58,613
What, somebody had a saxophone?

186
00:14:58,741 --> 00:15:01,738
What else? Drum kit? Rhythm section?

187
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,934
How many women were there?

188
00:15:45,827 --> 00:15:48,220
Three or four. But no Katya.

189
00:15:50,154 --> 00:15:53,038
But there was someone, wasn't there?

190
00:15:55,485 --> 00:15:58,243
Yes. There was someone.

191
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:01,333
Someone who is the reason
why we're all here. Yes?

192
00:16:01,536 --> 00:16:03,530
- A man or a woman?
- Name?

193
00:16:04,621 --> 00:16:09,306
Christ. The way you people
come alive when you smell blood.

194
00:16:34,355 --> 00:16:36,715
They called him... Dante.

195
00:16:37,441 --> 00:16:39,197
As in "Inferno".

196
00:16:39,325 --> 00:16:43,245
The others said he was on holiday.
A drinking holiday.

197
00:16:43,532 --> 00:16:45,971
He worked some place
where drinking wasn't on.

198
00:16:46,497 --> 00:16:48,492
Everyone deferred to him.

199
00:16:48,622 --> 00:16:52,143
He never spoke.
He just got drunk and stared.

200
00:16:52,548 --> 00:16:55,753
- Stared?
- Mm. At me.

201
00:16:56,797 --> 00:16:59,521
Did Dante arrive on his own
or with others?

202
00:17:00,323 --> 00:17:02,318
I don't know.

203
00:17:02,447 --> 00:17:04,406
Keep going.

204
00:17:05,453 --> 00:17:08,690
Then I decided to give them all
a rest from wonderful me,

205
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,178
let them talk Russian for a while.

206
00:17:11,304 --> 00:17:14,427
There's a graveyard
a couple of hundred yards up the hill.

207
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:16,862
It's a place of pilgrimage.

208
00:17:24,488 --> 00:17:28,693
"If there is to be hope,
we must all betray our countries."

209
00:17:28,815 --> 00:17:31,050
Ah, Dante, old chum.

210
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,698
Come to pay your respects
to old Boris, have you?

211
00:17:33,825 --> 00:17:35,784
Boris Pasternak.

212
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:39,307
Do you think he knows
people are allowed to read him again?

213
00:17:39,435 --> 00:17:43,721
"All victims are equal.
None is more equal than others."

214
00:17:43,843 --> 00:17:46,886
Yes, well... some write better than others.

215
00:17:47,009 --> 00:17:51,966
"How sweet it is to hate one's native land,
to desire its ruin,

216
00:17:52,098 --> 00:17:58,219
and in its ruin to discern
the dawn of universal rebirth."

217
00:17:58,671 --> 00:18:02,591
- Pasternak?
- No. Pecherin. An earlier poet.

218
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,997
Pecherin understood that it's possible to
love your country while hating its system.

219
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:11,090
If you say so.

220
00:18:12,536 --> 00:18:14,496
I love my country.

221
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:17,297
I love it too - your country.

222
00:18:18,827 --> 00:18:21,141
And I'm reasonably fond of my own.

223
00:18:21,271 --> 00:18:25,957
To save it, perhaps
it's necessary to betray it. Yes?

224
00:18:26,081 --> 00:18:28,680
Because you and I, we love truth.

225
00:18:32,412 --> 00:18:34,371
Who are you, Dante?

226
00:18:34,977 --> 00:18:37,289
What do you do for a living?

227
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:41,378
I am a moral outcast.

228
00:18:41,509 --> 00:18:44,108
Oh, it's always nice to meet a writer.

229
00:18:44,955 --> 00:18:47,713
And what sort of rubbish
are you turning out now?

230
00:18:47,841 --> 00:18:49,800
Lies.

231
00:18:50,365 --> 00:18:52,325
I am the lie.

232
00:18:54,732 --> 00:18:56,008
Really?

233
00:19:00,343 --> 00:19:02,383
You spoke the truth.

234
00:19:02,507 --> 00:19:08,308
Promise me that you are not a spy, and
then I will make you a promise in return.

235
00:19:08,959 --> 00:19:12,355
I'm not a spy, actually. Not my line.

236
00:19:13,047 --> 00:19:16,045
You are nobody's spy? Not even ours?

237
00:19:18,096 --> 00:19:21,891
Dante, I'm getting a bit jumpy,
to be honest.

238
00:19:22,384 --> 00:19:24,582
I'm nobody's spy.

239
00:19:27,272 --> 00:19:30,749
Let's talk about something else.
How about chess?

240
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:35,723
Oh, chess. In chess there are no lies.
But in my game lies are everything.

241
00:19:37,532 --> 00:19:39,125
What game is that?

242
00:19:39,254 --> 00:19:42,570
The Soviet knight is dying
inside his armour.

243
00:19:42,701 --> 00:19:44,615
You are in danger only from our lies.

244
00:19:44,745 --> 00:19:47,822
I commit the lie every day.
I lie even to my masters.

245
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:53,318
So, promise me that if I ever find
the courage to think like a hero,

246
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,646
then you will act like
a merely decent human being. Right?

247
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:02,646
- Dante, leave me out, will you?
- Hey, you cannot reject me.

248
00:20:02,778 --> 00:20:05,057
Because I am strengthened
by your rejection.

249
00:20:05,182 --> 00:20:07,336
So, promise me.

250
00:20:07,986 --> 00:20:11,223
What the hell am I promising,
for God's sake?

251
00:20:12,315 --> 00:20:14,275
Promise.

252
00:20:15,521 --> 00:20:17,561
All right.

253
00:20:19,288 --> 00:20:21,647
If you ever manage to be a hero,

254
00:20:22,694 --> 00:20:25,896
I'll be a... decent human being.

255
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,177
OK?

256
00:20:27,302 --> 00:20:28,817
Promise?

257
00:20:28,945 --> 00:20:30,905
I promise.

258
00:20:33,153 --> 00:20:37,393
Why didn't you come to us?! I know why.
You put your head in the sand.

259
00:20:37,521 --> 00:20:40,085
Don't know because don't want to know.

260
00:20:41,568 --> 00:20:44,884
I'm sorry, but we're going to need
your rather serious help.

261
00:20:50,906 --> 00:20:54,701
Then I asked him "What am I supposed
to be promising, for God's sake?"

262
00:20:54,832 --> 00:20:58,434
Why didn't you come to us?! I know why.
You put your head in the sand.

263
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,873
Don't know because don't want to know.

264
00:21:01,004 --> 00:21:04,765
- Who the hell is that?
- Walter? He's a character.

265
00:21:04,892 --> 00:21:08,652
I'm sorry, but we're going to need
your rather serious help.

266
00:21:08,778 --> 00:21:11,695
- That's it.
- And the notebooks?

267
00:21:11,824 --> 00:21:15,026
The notebooks don't mesh
with any disinformation artist,

268
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:17,954
con man or intelligence peddler we know.

269
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:21,391
Our psychology and handwriting gurus
tried to fault them.

270
00:21:21,522 --> 00:21:24,884
- And?
- They failed.

271
00:21:25,449 --> 00:21:27,568
Try harder, Russell.

272
00:21:28,975 --> 00:21:30,536
No.

273
00:21:31,419 --> 00:21:32,981
No.

274
00:21:33,984 --> 00:21:35,421
No.

275
00:21:35,548 --> 00:21:37,587
Not even a perhaps or a maybe?

276
00:21:37,711 --> 00:21:42,430
No. Not even a tickle, old boy.
They're not in Dante's class.

277
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,080
All right.

278
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:53,653
Is that Katya?

279
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:56,778
- That's her.
- You remember her now?

280
00:22:03,118 --> 00:22:05,077
No such luck.

281
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,531
Choose someone else.

282
00:22:33,654 --> 00:22:36,298
We didn't choose you. Dante did.

283
00:22:37,621 --> 00:22:39,741
Because I wasn't a spy.

284
00:22:39,865 --> 00:22:43,307
We're not asking you to build
the beastly rockets or push the button.

285
00:22:43,432 --> 00:22:45,870
Only to help improve
our knowledge of the enemy.

286
00:22:45,996 --> 00:22:49,598
And if the enemy turns out to be a friend,
where's the harm?

287
00:22:49,724 --> 00:22:53,086
I thought we were all supposed
to be chums together now.

288
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:55,044
Oh, my dear Lord!

289
00:22:55,174 --> 00:22:58,889
Because this year it suits them
to roll over and play nice doggie?

290
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:02,062
Because this year they're
on the floor anyway? You ninny.

291
00:23:02,185 --> 00:23:04,705
All the more reason to spy
the daylights out of 'em.

292
00:23:04,831 --> 00:23:08,307
Kick 'em in the balls
every time they get to their knees.

293
00:23:08,437 --> 00:23:10,672
Well, that's where I disagree.

294
00:23:11,082 --> 00:23:14,125
I'll back my Russia against yours
any time.

295
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:16,362
Nah.

296
00:23:16,491 --> 00:23:18,930
I'm sorry, Ned. No go.

297
00:23:50,675 --> 00:23:53,718
Bloody woman. I must've given offence.

298
00:23:56,084 --> 00:23:58,205
She has a point.

299
00:23:58,489 --> 00:24:00,723
Worry about Dante.

300
00:24:00,854 --> 00:24:02,608
He reached out for you.

301
00:24:02,737 --> 00:24:05,049
Would you rather
throw him to the Americans?

302
00:24:05,181 --> 00:24:07,495
Don't be fooled by Bob's Yaley manner.

303
00:24:07,626 --> 00:24:11,068
The Yanks will take Dante,
put him on a spit and have a barbecue.

304
00:24:11,193 --> 00:24:13,427
How will you live with yourself?

305
00:24:13,556 --> 00:24:15,756
I don't live with myself.

306
00:24:16,281 --> 00:24:18,720
In fact, I try to give myself a wide berth.

307
00:24:18,846 --> 00:24:22,402
I'm offering you a fresh start.
And a fat cheque.

308
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,813
Never mind the money.
Barley's far too grand.

309
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:28,093
This is something people write in for.

310
00:24:28,224 --> 00:24:31,779
The chance to be an active player
in the defence of their country.

311
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:34,873
You live in a free society.
You've no choice.

312
00:24:34,995 --> 00:24:39,077
Any decent church would've
burnt you bastards years ago.

313
00:24:43,532 --> 00:24:45,811
You're a fool to use me.

314
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,500
I let people down.

315
00:25:02,366 --> 00:25:04,007
Abercrombie and Blair.

316
00:25:04,129 --> 00:25:09,259
Is it the office of...
Mr Bartholomew Scott Blair?

317
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,260
Yes. But he isn't in at the moment.

318
00:25:11,383 --> 00:25:13,776
Can I help, or would you
like to leave a message?

319
00:25:13,907 --> 00:25:16,825
No, thank you. It is a publishing matter.

320
00:25:16,953 --> 00:25:19,425
I will telephone again. Thank you.

321
00:25:23,004 --> 00:25:25,887
Crowds are good,
if you keep moving.

322
00:25:30,016 --> 00:25:32,295
Open spaces are good.

323
00:25:35,065 --> 00:25:38,143
Talking in the street is OK, if you have to.

324
00:25:38,272 --> 00:25:41,030
Never, never talk in a car
or in your hotel room,

325
00:25:41,158 --> 00:25:44,040
except for the benefit
of their microphones.

326
00:25:44,163 --> 00:25:49,805
If you've read anything about playing
the radio or running the taps, forget it.

327
00:25:49,933 --> 00:25:52,691
That's right. The source
is the star of the show.

328
00:25:52,818 --> 00:25:56,739
And the star decides
whether to make the meeting or abort.

329
00:25:57,387 --> 00:26:00,543
This is fun. Is that why you keep it secret?

330
00:26:02,396 --> 00:26:04,675
Did you spot our watchers?

331
00:26:05,562 --> 00:26:08,958
The tramp raiding the dustbin,
the woman with the white shoes,

332
00:26:09,088 --> 00:26:11,927
and, of course, the man with the tracksuit.

333
00:26:12,054 --> 00:26:15,131
You scored nil. Out of a possible 12.

334
00:26:16,382 --> 00:26:19,538
The lesson is
you'll never know who they are.

335
00:26:20,669 --> 00:26:26,152
If you need to write something down, use
a single sheet of paper on a hard surface.

336
00:26:26,641 --> 00:26:28,954
That leaves no impression.

337
00:26:30,087 --> 00:26:33,324
How many such surfaces
can you see in this room?

338
00:26:34,454 --> 00:26:37,338
Well, including the windowsill... four.

339
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,501
Seven.

340
00:26:39,623 --> 00:26:41,824
This is often easiest.

341
00:26:43,632 --> 00:26:46,434
Then wipe it clean - rubbing hard.

342
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:49,393
The issue is why.

343
00:26:49,963 --> 00:26:52,846
That's what you're looking for all the time.

344
00:26:52,969 --> 00:26:55,693
If we trust the motive, we trust the man.

345
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:57,969
Then we can trust the material.

346
00:26:58,419 --> 00:27:00,732
Why did Dante pick on Katya?

347
00:27:01,144 --> 00:27:03,582
Why does he put her life at risk?

348
00:27:03,708 --> 00:27:05,748
Why does she let him?

349
00:27:06,393 --> 00:27:08,034
Is she a spy?

350
00:27:08,156 --> 00:27:12,397
- It's voice-activated, sir. You switch...
- I know all this. I've had it up to here.

351
00:27:12,524 --> 00:27:14,998
I just want to get it done.
What's the hold-up?

352
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:20,654
It's everything we ever wanted to know
about Russia and were afraid to ask.

353
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:24,176
- Sounds like the pot of gold.
- Sounds like a crock of shit.

354
00:27:24,385 --> 00:27:28,103
Some unidentified walk-in is telling us
the Russians are way behind,

355
00:27:28,233 --> 00:27:31,231
they can't hurt us,
we can pull in our horns.

356
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:34,835
Who the hell is gonna
sell that story on the Hill?

357
00:27:35,647 --> 00:27:37,527
Russell?

358
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:40,693
It could turn around
and bite us right in the ass.

359
00:27:40,816 --> 00:27:42,856
Let the Brits run with it for a while.

360
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:47,027
Dante is their source,
and, uh... Scott Blair is their problem.

361
00:27:47,148 --> 00:27:50,749
I'll go with that, Russell. But I want
Joe and Larry with him in London.

362
00:27:50,874 --> 00:27:52,709
Friendly observers, OK?

363
00:27:54,361 --> 00:27:56,560
You'll do us proud, Barley.

364
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:01,250
I've brought you a present.

365
00:28:02,456 --> 00:28:05,054
It's not to keep. It's just to sniff.

366
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:14,346
- Am I supposed to offer to publish it?
- Offer him anything he wants.

367
00:28:14,479 --> 00:28:17,475
Say anything you need to say
to keep him with us.

368
00:28:17,604 --> 00:28:19,802
Except the truth?

369
00:28:22,893 --> 00:28:25,127
Bon voyage, Barley.

370
00:28:25,858 --> 00:28:29,746
Come back with the goods on Dante,
starting with his real name,

371
00:28:29,867 --> 00:28:32,863
and I'll get you a knighthood for literature.

372
00:28:36,118 --> 00:28:38,157
The Russia House.

373
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:57,947
Barley Scott Blair.
Abercrombie and Blair?

374
00:28:58,317 --> 00:29:00,472
London. The publishers.

375
00:29:01,124 --> 00:29:03,322
I believe you know Niki Landau.

376
00:29:03,448 --> 00:29:04,439
Yes.

377
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:08,729
Well, Niki was very insistent that I should
give you a call. How do you do?

378
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,774
How do you do?

379
00:29:11,903 --> 00:29:14,660
I'll tell you why I'm calling.
I'm here in Moscow.

380
00:29:14,788 --> 00:29:18,709
And Niki's sent you about a ton of tea.
Well, a couple of pounds.

381
00:29:18,836 --> 00:29:20,795
I hope you like tea.

382
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,636
I was wondering
if we could arrange a handover.

383
00:29:24,767 --> 00:29:27,445
- A handover?
- Do you ever escape for lunch?

384
00:29:27,571 --> 00:29:29,725
Yes. Of course.

385
00:29:29,855 --> 00:29:33,013
Well, how about today?
I'm at the Ukraine Hotel.

386
00:29:33,343 --> 00:29:36,784
- That would be convenient.
- Good. Marvellous.

387
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:39,143
Well, I'll be outside from 12.30 on.

388
00:29:39,273 --> 00:29:42,589
- How will I know you?
- Oh, listen, I'm easy to recognise.

389
00:29:42,719 --> 00:29:46,766
I look like a large, unmade bed
with a shopping bag attached.

390
00:29:54,662 --> 00:29:55,698
We're off.

391
00:30:19,347 --> 00:30:21,306
Hi. Hello.

392
00:30:22,513 --> 00:30:24,267
You're Katya, of course.

393
00:30:24,396 --> 00:30:27,393
Yes. And you must be Mr Barley.

394
00:30:27,521 --> 00:30:30,563
Yes, indeed. The same. Well done.

395
00:30:31,649 --> 00:30:34,293
Well, er... where shall we go?

396
00:30:34,414 --> 00:30:37,378
I brought your stuff from Niki,
but I'll carry it.

397
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,143
How did you recognise me, Mr Barley?

398
00:30:41,307 --> 00:30:45,512
Well, Niki said you were Russia's answer
to the Venus de Milo.

399
00:30:46,396 --> 00:30:48,436
That is ridiculous.

400
00:31:03,467 --> 00:31:06,385
I was nearly arrested here
three years ago.

401
00:31:06,994 --> 00:31:09,672
They said I was photographing
a military subject.

402
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:13,275
- And were you?
- No. A soldier and his girlfriend.

403
00:31:13,406 --> 00:31:15,718
They asked me to take their picture.

404
00:31:26,229 --> 00:31:28,953
Obviously I received the manuscript.

405
00:31:31,959 --> 00:31:34,318
I will take you to where
we can have lunch.

406
00:31:34,445 --> 00:31:36,963
If you do not mind, I will first buy shoes.

407
00:31:37,089 --> 00:31:39,163
Shoes?

408
00:31:39,734 --> 00:31:41,932
Today there is a shipment of shoes.

409
00:31:42,058 --> 00:31:45,819
With perestroika, there is
even less available than before.

410
00:31:46,145 --> 00:31:50,352
- Really? I thought things were improving.
- Everything is corrupt and incompetent.

411
00:31:50,474 --> 00:31:53,711
Perhaps different people
are now stealing. I don't know.

412
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,640
Keep your voice down.

413
00:31:55,763 --> 00:31:57,962
Complaining is our new human right.

414
00:31:58,087 --> 00:32:01,450
Glasnost gives everyone
the right to complain and accuse,

415
00:32:01,574 --> 00:32:03,853
but it doesn't make more shoes.

416
00:32:22,613 --> 00:32:25,610
Tell me about your new Russian book.

417
00:32:26,259 --> 00:32:28,254
Oh, yes. The book.

418
00:32:29,144 --> 00:32:33,429
Well, my problem is that, er,
I don't know the author's real name,

419
00:32:33,552 --> 00:32:36,631
let alone where he gets
all his information from.

420
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:39,597
Learned his craft and so forth. Hm?

421
00:32:40,245 --> 00:32:42,683
Such personal questions
are not appropriate.

422
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:45,567
Some writers can only work in obscurity.

423
00:32:46,135 --> 00:32:48,255
But you know publishing, hm?

424
00:32:48,379 --> 00:32:52,620
If a fella's written about
the hill tribes of northern Burma,

425
00:32:52,748 --> 00:32:56,668
well, you're entitled to know if he's
ever been further south than Minsk.

426
00:32:56,795 --> 00:33:00,920
Especially if it's a really important book.
Which this one is.

427
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:03,684
Dynamite, in fact.

428
00:33:04,409 --> 00:33:07,805
The author was inspired by certain
opinions of a British publisher

429
00:33:07,936 --> 00:33:10,215
concerning world peace.

430
00:33:11,021 --> 00:33:14,178
Do you think he'd like
to meet that publisher again?

431
00:33:14,988 --> 00:33:17,905
It is not known. This can be established.

432
00:33:18,034 --> 00:33:20,872
The publisher would like
to meet him again.

433
00:33:23,444 --> 00:33:26,247
How long are you staying in Moscow,
please, Mr Barley?

434
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:29,252
Seven days... Mrs Katya.

435
00:33:55,864 --> 00:33:58,301
- Where do you live?
- With my children.

436
00:33:58,428 --> 00:34:00,867
Your children? How many?

437
00:34:00,992 --> 00:34:04,788
I have a boy and a girl.
They are eight and nine years old.

438
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:06,879
It is not relevant.

439
00:34:07,804 --> 00:34:10,039
What does your husband do?

440
00:34:10,571 --> 00:34:12,405
It is not important.

441
00:34:12,533 --> 00:34:14,927
- Is he a publisher too?
- No.

442
00:34:15,058 --> 00:34:16,939
Is he a writer?

443
00:34:17,062 --> 00:34:18,098
No.

444
00:34:18,224 --> 00:34:20,422
A composer? A cook?

445
00:34:21,029 --> 00:34:23,628
Is he a dressmaker in Vladivostok?

446
00:34:24,235 --> 00:34:28,076
His factory prefabricates houses
for rural areas.

447
00:34:30,206 --> 00:34:34,092
We are divorced.
Like everybody else in Moscow.

448
00:34:41,507 --> 00:34:44,789
Unfortunately, I have
to return to my children now.

449
00:34:44,913 --> 00:34:46,987
Isn't someone looking after them?

450
00:34:47,117 --> 00:34:50,080
Well, ring up. Tell them
you've met a fascinating man

451
00:34:50,203 --> 00:34:53,040
that wants to talk literature
to you all day.

452
00:34:53,168 --> 00:34:54,923
I'm sorry. I cannot.

453
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:57,366
Oh, look, we've hardly met.

454
00:35:04,548 --> 00:35:06,064
I need time.

455
00:35:06,191 --> 00:35:10,078
I've got 10,000 enormously
serious things to discuss

456
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:12,399
with a beautiful Russian woman.

457
00:35:13,004 --> 00:35:16,286
I don't bite, I don't lie...
Have dinner with me.

458
00:35:17,172 --> 00:35:20,808
- At least show me something of Moscow.
- It is not convenient.

459
00:35:20,938 --> 00:35:23,582
- Then give me your home number.
- It is not convenient.

460
00:35:23,703 --> 00:35:25,663
- Will you call me, then?
- Perhaps.

461
00:35:25,787 --> 00:35:26,745
When?

462
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:29,149
Perhaps I shall call you late tonight.

463
00:35:29,274 --> 00:35:31,154
No, not "perhaps".

464
00:35:31,278 --> 00:35:33,237
I shall call you.

465
00:35:45,304 --> 00:35:47,583
You forgot to give her the tea.

466
00:35:58,248 --> 00:36:00,607
- Mr Blair, sir?
- Wicklow.

467
00:36:01,814 --> 00:36:05,051
Excellent morning's work, sir.
No problems.

468
00:36:06,943 --> 00:36:12,664
Oh, by the way, you asked why so many
Russians use the word "convenient".

469
00:36:13,316 --> 00:36:17,475
In Russian it's "udobno".
But it also means "proper".

470
00:36:19,085 --> 00:36:22,208
- A bit confusing really.
- Yes, it is indeed.

471
00:36:36,638 --> 00:36:38,312
We have an interim, sir.

472
00:36:38,441 --> 00:36:43,524
Katya left her office, took a taxi,
unknown destination. We have it covered.

473
00:36:55,271 --> 00:36:56,912
Da?

474
00:36:57,034 --> 00:36:58,550
Da, eta Alina.

475
00:37:00,722 --> 00:37:02,796
- Dobry dyen.
- Barley!

476
00:37:02,926 --> 00:37:05,239
- Welcome to Moscow, my dear chap!
- Alik.

477
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:09,849
Why do you look so healthy? Why
have you no hangover? Are you in love?

478
00:37:10,379 --> 00:37:12,054
How did you know, Alik?

479
00:37:12,182 --> 00:37:15,944
Meet Leonard Carl Wicklow,
our new editor of Soviet books.

480
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:18,634
Alik Zapadny of VAAP,

481
00:37:18,755 --> 00:37:22,357
the all-suffocating
Soviet Copyright Agency.

482
00:37:23,163 --> 00:37:28,006
- How is Barley paying you, Mr Wicklow?
- Oh, Russia's top of the pops these days.

483
00:37:28,132 --> 00:37:31,335
Mention to the money boys
that we want to build up a Russian list

484
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:33,338
and they throw money at us.

485
00:37:33,462 --> 00:37:38,021
Have you a sales force, or are you
still relying on divine intervention?

486
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:40,384
And how about translators?

487
00:37:40,514 --> 00:37:45,439
On fiction we will use our own
and take another 5% royalty. How's that?

488
00:37:46,846 --> 00:37:49,684
- We'll consider it.
- No, I don't think so.

489
00:37:50,253 --> 00:37:52,372
We don't have the margin.

490
00:37:52,496 --> 00:37:54,456
Exactly.

491
00:37:54,941 --> 00:37:56,901
Well done, Wickers.

492
00:37:58,307 --> 00:38:01,670
- Jesus, Barley!
- Yuri.

493
00:38:01,794 --> 00:38:04,950
What are you doing here?
You're a month early for the book fair.

494
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:09,239
Yuri, I want you to meet Len Wicklow,
our new Russian-speaking specialist.

495
00:38:09,367 --> 00:38:11,327
Hello. You a spy?

496
00:38:11,451 --> 00:38:14,448
- Only in my spare time, sir.
- Jesus, I like him.

497
00:38:14,576 --> 00:38:16,891
Oh, thank you. Sit down, friend.

498
00:38:18,384 --> 00:38:20,504
Let's deal direct, OK?

499
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:24,433
To hell with those assholes at VAAP.

500
00:38:25,717 --> 00:38:28,759
Stay away from them.
Especially Zapadny.

501
00:38:29,203 --> 00:38:31,004
I don't say he's KGB.

502
00:38:31,127 --> 00:38:35,048
All I say is he needed some damned good
friends to get him back into circulation.

503
00:38:35,174 --> 00:38:37,010
Know what I mean?

504
00:38:37,138 --> 00:38:39,212
- Cheers.
- Na zdorovye.

505
00:38:39,823 --> 00:38:42,900
Oh, Barley... I have something for you.

506
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:48,350
Some of these writers haven't yet
been to jail. But I'm working on it.

507
00:38:48,479 --> 00:38:53,163
I'll make them famous in the West
even if it kills them.

508
00:38:59,419 --> 00:39:00,376
It's me.

509
00:39:00,942 --> 00:39:02,502
Do I disturb you?

510
00:39:03,066 --> 00:39:05,426
Deeply. Come over.

511
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:12,802
You invited me to show you Moscow
tomorrow, I think.

512
00:39:13,645 --> 00:39:17,007
I did. Where do I send the glass coach?

513
00:39:18,052 --> 00:39:22,054
I have the tapes, and I've never heard
such pussyfooting around in my life!

514
00:39:22,181 --> 00:39:25,657
Barley has gotta tell Katya:
no more Greta fucking Garbo.

515
00:39:25,788 --> 00:39:28,067
And Dante better shit or get off the pot.

516
00:39:28,191 --> 00:39:30,585
I'm being pelted with crap
in the streets here!

517
00:39:30,716 --> 00:39:33,440
All right, Russell, message understood.

518
00:39:33,762 --> 00:39:35,278
Brock?

519
00:39:35,405 --> 00:39:38,448
Russell's metaphors are becoming
rather scatological.

520
00:39:38,571 --> 00:39:41,328
Signal Paddy at the embassy.
I want him to talk to Barley.

521
00:39:59,208 --> 00:40:01,168
Er, we're this way.

522
00:40:20,929 --> 00:40:23,127
I hope you like churches.

523
00:40:23,253 --> 00:40:26,695
In Russia we don't ask that.
It is not convenient.

524
00:40:26,819 --> 00:40:29,861
Ah. I think you mean "proper". No?

525
00:40:29,984 --> 00:40:31,944
- Proper?
- Mm.

526
00:40:32,308 --> 00:40:34,542
Nyet. Convenient.

527
00:40:44,291 --> 00:40:48,416
Now you know why hardly anyone
comes up here. Mind your head.

528
00:40:51,144 --> 00:40:53,183
One more to go. This way.

529
00:41:02,604 --> 00:41:04,724
This is just like school.

530
00:41:04,848 --> 00:41:08,005
Dear old, bloody old... school.

531
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:16,659
Who is that man down there?

532
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:19,228
Oh, he's my editor. He's keeping lookout.

533
00:41:20,476 --> 00:41:22,791
Are we ready? Thank you, Brock.

534
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:29,974
Why is an editor keeping a lookout?

535
00:41:30,095 --> 00:41:31,850
Well...

536
00:41:36,547 --> 00:41:38,382
Do you drink this stuff?

537
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:40,105
No.

538
00:41:41,235 --> 00:41:43,195
Me neither.

539
00:41:46,765 --> 00:41:49,443
What's Dante's real name, huh?

540
00:41:51,493 --> 00:41:53,454
Who is he?

541
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,860
Does he test things?

542
00:41:57,466 --> 00:42:00,543
Is he a physicist?
An engineer? Is he army?

543
00:42:02,875 --> 00:42:04,755
Does he like ice cream?

544
00:42:04,878 --> 00:42:06,918
Does he like the movies?

545
00:42:07,523 --> 00:42:10,966
Is he one man? Is he two? Is he a group?

546
00:42:13,735 --> 00:42:16,972
Why don't you just start talking
and let's see how it goes?

547
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:20,463
Come on, Katya. You started this, I didn't.

548
00:42:21,709 --> 00:42:26,873
Come on, it's me, Barley Blair.
I do jokes, I do bird noises, I drink.

549
00:42:28,242 --> 00:42:30,201
I'm a friend.

550
00:42:31,207 --> 00:42:34,923
- Who is he?
- I don't know what I may tell you.

551
00:42:36,897 --> 00:42:39,211
What did he tell you to tell me?

552
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:43,102
Whatever is necessary.
That I should trust you.

553
00:42:43,229 --> 00:42:45,987
He was generous. It is his nature.

554
00:42:46,715 --> 00:42:50,192
Why did you send me the book
if you didn't trust me?

555
00:42:50,803 --> 00:42:54,849
It was for him that I sent it.
I did not select you, he did.

556
00:42:56,613 --> 00:42:57,969
Oh.

557
00:43:00,821 --> 00:43:03,386
He is... my friend.

558
00:43:04,627 --> 00:43:07,147
Is this what you usually do for friends?

559
00:43:07,272 --> 00:43:09,917
Smuggle their manuscripts
out to the West?

560
00:43:10,038 --> 00:43:12,318
Risk your life, your children?

561
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:16,447
Does he understand the consequences?
Does he care?

562
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:18,485
He is reconciled.

563
00:43:18,614 --> 00:43:21,178
- Are you?
- Of course.

564
00:43:21,298 --> 00:43:23,258
And your children?

565
00:43:24,504 --> 00:43:27,023
It is for them and their generation.

566
00:43:28,913 --> 00:43:31,637
He is inspired by the new openness here.

567
00:43:31,758 --> 00:43:34,835
But he knows that nothing
will change by itself.

568
00:43:35,644 --> 00:43:37,559
- And you agree?
- Yes! And so do you!

569
00:43:37,688 --> 00:43:40,891
You spoke for him.
It is for you we are here!

570
00:43:44,661 --> 00:43:46,815
That's worth a drink.

571
00:43:57,325 --> 00:44:02,327
He is not a soldier.
He is a scientist. He is a physicist.

572
00:44:02,654 --> 00:44:06,130
- Also qualified in aspects of engineering.
- Better! Ha-ha!

573
00:44:06,261 --> 00:44:08,938
Engineering.
We're making progress, gentlemen.

574
00:44:09,947 --> 00:44:11,943
Where was he trained?

575
00:44:12,072 --> 00:44:13,793
He went to the LITMO.

576
00:44:13,915 --> 00:44:17,038
Afterwards to postgraduate studies
at the university.

577
00:44:17,161 --> 00:44:18,198
What's the LITMO?

578
00:44:18,604 --> 00:44:22,924
Leningrad Institute of Mechanical and
Optical Science! Write that down, fellas.

579
00:44:23,172 --> 00:44:27,171
LITMO is the Leningrad Institute
for Mechanical and Optical Science.

580
00:44:27,299 --> 00:44:32,178
He was extremely brilliant.
At 14 he won a mathematics olympiad.

581
00:44:32,309 --> 00:44:34,269
Mathematics.

582
00:44:35,074 --> 00:44:39,073
When I was at school,
they were the people I couldn't stand.

583
00:44:41,164 --> 00:44:45,485
Naturally, if you are not so intelligent,
you will be jealous.

584
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:02,756
From university he went
to Academgorodok,

585
00:45:02,885 --> 00:45:05,449
the City of Science at Novosibirsk.

586
00:45:05,569 --> 00:45:08,932
He was... like a meteor there.

587
00:45:09,056 --> 00:45:11,095
Is that where you met him?

588
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:13,015
No!

589
00:45:13,143 --> 00:45:17,110
In Leningrad. I was a child.
A great intellectual of 16.

590
00:45:17,231 --> 00:45:19,795
- I met Yakov at the club...
- Yakov?

591
00:45:20,797 --> 00:45:23,270
- Yakov is Dante?
- Yes. Yakov.

592
00:45:23,522 --> 00:45:26,565
- First name Yakov!
- Jacky.

593
00:45:26,808 --> 00:45:29,726
We met at the Club of Scientists.

594
00:45:29,855 --> 00:45:33,136
It was at a closed showing
of a foreign film.

595
00:45:33,261 --> 00:45:36,623
It was by Godard.
?bout de souffle. Breathless.

596
00:45:36,746 --> 00:45:38,901
I went with my father.

597
00:45:42,076 --> 00:45:44,436
And what year are we talking about now?

598
00:45:44,561 --> 00:45:46,156
1968.

599
00:45:46,284 --> 00:45:48,563
You remember '68?

600
00:45:48,689 --> 00:45:52,404
The Paris students at the barricades,
American students against Vietnam,

601
00:45:52,535 --> 00:45:55,533
and for us it was Czechoslovakia.

602
00:46:00,069 --> 00:46:03,785
Yakov said that the Russians
would never stop

603
00:46:03,917 --> 00:46:06,675
the extraordinary reforms
happening there.

604
00:46:06,802 --> 00:46:09,114
It was the start of a new age.

605
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:12,331
He had come back to Leningrad
to be a part of it.

606
00:46:12,452 --> 00:46:14,572
- From where?
- From the military.

607
00:46:15,137 --> 00:46:19,742
They had seduced him with privileges,
money for his researches...

608
00:46:20,307 --> 00:46:21,823
They had corrupted him.

609
00:46:21,949 --> 00:46:27,477
He had come back to Leningrad
to recover his innocence.

610
00:46:28,521 --> 00:46:30,480
He was beautiful.

611
00:46:30,605 --> 00:46:32,885
Not like a scientist, like an...

612
00:46:34,172 --> 00:46:36,132
artist.

613
00:46:38,419 --> 00:46:40,698
So you fell in love with him.

614
00:46:43,148 --> 00:46:45,620
He was my first lover.

615
00:47:02,624 --> 00:47:06,067
It was the same night
that the tanks entered Prague.

616
00:47:08,916 --> 00:47:11,559
There was no more innocence anywhere.

617
00:47:12,962 --> 00:47:15,960
Yakov said that innocence
was a delusion.

618
00:47:16,088 --> 00:47:19,610
And a few weeks later
he returned to the military.

619
00:47:20,938 --> 00:47:23,821
I did not talk to him for many years.

620
00:47:23,943 --> 00:47:30,794
Until last year, when he met a British
publisher who spoke to his heart.

621
00:47:32,638 --> 00:47:34,999
Next day, Yakov telephoned me
at the office.

622
00:47:35,124 --> 00:47:40,081
He had decided what he must do.
He needed my help.

623
00:47:40,894 --> 00:47:44,735
Is he alone in this?
Does he need anyone else's help?

624
00:47:45,301 --> 00:47:46,863
No.

625
00:47:46,985 --> 00:47:49,903
- None of his drinking friends?
- No.

626
00:47:50,632 --> 00:47:52,866
How can you be so certain?

627
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:59,358
Because I am certain that
in his thoughts he is completely alone.

628
00:48:02,453 --> 00:48:04,574
Are you happy with him?

629
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:08,615
- Please?
- I mean, er... do you like him?

630
00:48:08,745 --> 00:48:12,870
As well as loving him.
Does he make you laugh? Hm?

631
00:48:13,994 --> 00:48:16,878
I believe that Yakov
is a great and important man,

632
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:23,406
who is trying to restore himself
and cannot survive without me.

633
00:48:26,578 --> 00:48:27,614
Oh.

634
00:48:29,864 --> 00:48:32,827
Jesus Christ, Mother of God! It's Savelyev!

635
00:48:34,191 --> 00:48:37,155
Yakov Yefremovich Savelyev!

636
00:48:39,001 --> 00:48:43,206
Did he mention anything about, er...
falsification of results?

637
00:48:46,213 --> 00:48:52,175
He talks about "the great lie".
Everything is part of the great lie.

638
00:48:52,305 --> 00:48:53,946
Ah. Go on.

639
00:48:54,069 --> 00:48:56,792
Are you part of the great lie also, Barley?

640
00:48:56,913 --> 00:48:57,585
What?

641
00:48:57,715 --> 00:49:00,917
I think I am also allowed to ask questions.

642
00:49:01,762 --> 00:49:03,995
Oh, of course. Ask.

643
00:49:06,211 --> 00:49:08,648
Are you Mr Bartholomew Scott Blair?

644
00:49:08,775 --> 00:49:11,169
- Aw, for God's sake...
- Are you?

645
00:49:12,222 --> 00:49:14,375
- Yes.
- Are you a publisher?

646
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,430
Yes.

647
00:49:19,274 --> 00:49:21,269
Are you a spy?

648
00:49:23,122 --> 00:49:24,717
No.

649
00:49:26,087 --> 00:49:29,529
Are you alone in this,
or were you sent by others?

650
00:49:34,101 --> 00:49:36,061
Answer her.

651
00:49:40,793 --> 00:49:42,594
I'm alone.

652
00:49:42,957 --> 00:49:45,236
Jesus! Fuck.

653
00:49:46,123 --> 00:49:48,596
I'm alone, and that's the God's truth.

654
00:49:53,777 --> 00:49:55,932
Never been more alone.

655
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:11,086
Yakov said he will meet you in Leningrad
in four days from now.

656
00:50:11,209 --> 00:50:14,127
He has proposed three places
and three times.

657
00:50:14,255 --> 00:50:18,734
He will keep one of the appointments,
if he can.

658
00:50:20,987 --> 00:50:22,742
Good.

659
00:50:25,275 --> 00:50:27,874
Reconstruction. Openness.

660
00:50:28,321 --> 00:50:30,920
He's going to reconstruct
the balance of terror,

661
00:50:31,045 --> 00:50:34,407
and open the ultimate can of worms.

662
00:50:34,692 --> 00:50:39,172
Savelyev?! My God, if Dante is Savelyev,
you guys don't know what you've got!

663
00:50:39,301 --> 00:50:41,695
Yes, we do. Trouble.

664
00:50:41,825 --> 00:50:44,788
Yakov Savelyev is
the right hand of God over there.

665
00:50:44,991 --> 00:50:49,117
And he says it's shit?
The Soviet threat's one big lie?

666
00:50:49,239 --> 00:50:50,674
And look at this.

667
00:50:50,801 --> 00:50:54,438
- They're bullshitting the Kremlin.
- Honour is due, Ned.

668
00:50:54,569 --> 00:50:57,247
Russell, I need your money.
And your love.

669
00:50:57,374 --> 00:51:01,089
I want an American partner for Barley.
I want him in Leningrad on Friday.

670
00:51:02,022 --> 00:51:04,666
I hear you, Ned. I'll get right back to you.

671
00:51:05,509 --> 00:51:10,193
If he says they can't hit Nevada on a clear
day, you better believe it. And be joyful.

672
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:14,763
Joyful? Most of our customers
come to this town with contracts

673
00:51:14,886 --> 00:51:19,490
to bring peace and prosperity to
the arms industry for the next 50 years.

674
00:51:19,975 --> 00:51:22,015
But how the fuck
do you peddle an arms race

675
00:51:22,139 --> 00:51:25,296
when the only asshole you've got
to race against is yourself?

676
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:46,059
The night train to Leningrad.

677
00:51:46,184 --> 00:51:51,220
I may have mentioned Mr Potomac Books,
my new American partner?

678
00:51:51,353 --> 00:51:55,319
Well, he's doing Leningrad,
and he summoned me for a powwow.

679
00:51:55,801 --> 00:51:58,479
- Powwow?
- I thought you knew English.

680
00:51:59,168 --> 00:52:01,321
"Powwow" is not English.

681
00:52:01,972 --> 00:52:04,650
- You must sit down.
- Sit down? Why?

682
00:52:04,777 --> 00:52:08,379
It is our custom before a long journey
first to sit down.

683
00:52:09,185 --> 00:52:11,340
Well, I'm lying down. Won't that do?

684
00:52:12,992 --> 00:52:17,837
Well... you are supposed
to sit on your luggage

685
00:52:17,961 --> 00:52:20,639
and sigh a little and cross yourself.

686
00:52:24,253 --> 00:52:26,212
Hold everything.

687
00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:35,191
OK.

688
00:52:37,757 --> 00:52:39,912
I was more comfortable lying down.

689
00:52:41,043 --> 00:52:43,243
Are you coming back to Moscow?

690
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:46,285
No, not this time.
I have to fly straight back to school.

691
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:47,974
School?

692
00:52:48,096 --> 00:52:51,333
Work. England.
It's a stupid expression of mine.

693
00:52:51,823 --> 00:52:53,897
I hope I didn't bore you last night.

694
00:52:54,027 --> 00:52:56,261
You did not bore me.

695
00:52:56,391 --> 00:52:58,627
Oh. Perhaps next time.

696
00:53:00,119 --> 00:53:03,116
I'll make a special journey
just to talk about myself.

697
00:53:04,246 --> 00:53:06,445
I wish you a good journey, Barley.

698
00:53:07,652 --> 00:53:08,882
I'll miss you.

699
00:54:32,087 --> 00:54:36,246
I want you to know something, Scott.
This little country is on the move.

700
00:54:36,375 --> 00:54:38,130
I smell hope here.

701
00:54:38,258 --> 00:54:40,651
I smell change. I smell commerce.

702
00:54:42,465 --> 00:54:46,626
And we are buying ourselves a piece of it.
I'm proud. Proud.

703
00:54:51,283 --> 00:54:53,641
0800 hours. Barley and Wicklow
are in Leningrad.

704
00:54:53,767 --> 00:54:55,761
Checked in at the Pribaltiyskaya Hotel.

705
00:54:56,371 --> 00:54:58,606
Good. We're on schedule.

706
00:54:58,735 --> 00:55:01,335
Barley's got three chances
to make contact.

707
00:55:01,461 --> 00:55:03,534
Now it's up to Dante.

708
00:55:49,629 --> 00:55:51,908
You want to sell me something?

709
00:55:53,236 --> 00:55:56,791
Cigarettes, Scotch, drugs, currency?

710
00:55:56,922 --> 00:55:58,996
No, thanks. Cheerio.

711
00:56:00,288 --> 00:56:02,168
You get lost?

712
00:56:02,292 --> 00:56:04,811
That's a good idea. Why don't you try it?

713
00:56:13,032 --> 00:56:14,513
One down, two to go.

714
00:56:33,028 --> 00:56:34,670
Where are you, Dante?

715
00:57:29,332 --> 00:57:32,933
Sir. Excuse me, sir,
but I think we are acquainted.

716
00:57:33,539 --> 00:57:37,381
Good God! The great Dante,
as I live and breathe!

717
00:57:38,148 --> 00:57:41,783
We met at that writer's party
at Peredelkino, remember?

718
00:57:41,915 --> 00:57:44,113
The only two sober people there.

719
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:47,314
- How are you?
- I'm very well.

720
00:57:48,366 --> 00:57:50,247
Welcome to Leningrad.

721
00:57:50,370 --> 00:57:53,527
You can walk a little?
It is safest to keep moving.

722
00:57:53,657 --> 00:57:55,855
Yes, they told me that.

723
00:57:59,106 --> 00:58:02,388
Barley's made contact! He's done it.

724
00:58:03,113 --> 00:58:05,233
Unfortunately, he couldn't find me.

725
00:58:05,357 --> 00:58:10,441
So he gave it to our authorities.
People of... discretion. Experts.

726
00:58:11,810 --> 00:58:13,850
You have betrayed me.

727
00:58:14,374 --> 00:58:16,333
Nobody's betrayed you.

728
00:58:16,938 --> 00:58:20,620
I told you. Your manuscript
went astray, that's all.

729
00:58:21,987 --> 00:58:24,382
Our authorities admire your book.

730
00:58:25,194 --> 00:58:27,507
But they need to know if it's true.

731
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:32,395
The best way would be
for you to talk with them.

732
00:58:32,568 --> 00:58:35,564
You came to tell me
you refuse to publish me?

733
00:58:35,693 --> 00:58:37,892
Dante, you're going too fast.

734
00:58:38,018 --> 00:58:39,932
Russia has no time.

735
00:58:40,062 --> 00:58:43,058
When the ice is thin,
you have to walk fast.

736
00:58:43,187 --> 00:58:45,421
To lose time is to lose everything.

737
00:58:45,552 --> 00:58:50,998
And then we all slide into the grave.
So be it. I will be the first corpse.

738
00:58:51,161 --> 00:58:53,475
And Katya second. What about her?

739
00:58:53,607 --> 00:58:55,566
She also chose.

740
00:58:56,611 --> 00:58:59,690
If we act together,
we will survive together.

741
00:59:00,298 --> 00:59:03,740
Have you forgotten
your words at Peredelkino?

742
00:59:06,068 --> 00:59:09,226
I am not the man you thought I was.

743
00:59:09,916 --> 00:59:14,202
You do not need to remind me that
man is not equal to his rhetoric.

744
00:59:14,324 --> 00:59:16,796
Our new people talk about openness.

745
00:59:18,291 --> 00:59:20,444
Disarmament. Peace.

746
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:25,381
Words.

747
00:59:26,306 --> 00:59:28,870
You like graveyards, Barley?

748
00:59:29,552 --> 00:59:32,515
Look. Here is ours if we fail.

749
00:59:34,281 --> 00:59:37,004
Chose a monument.

750
00:59:50,791 --> 00:59:54,232
Leave Katya out.
Go with the experts and leave her out.

751
00:59:54,356 --> 00:59:58,404
I shall wish a book jacket that is only
letters. No sensational drawings. Yes?

752
00:59:58,525 --> 01:00:00,964
Send the money to a deserving cause.

753
01:00:01,089 --> 01:00:03,813
- Dante...
- What is the matter? Are you afraid?

754
01:00:03,934 --> 01:00:06,213
Well, of course I'm bloody afraid!

755
01:00:07,942 --> 01:00:11,180
Here... the Revolution started.

756
01:00:11,950 --> 01:00:17,431
Imagine this place on that day when
the battleship Aurora fired that blank shot

757
01:00:17,559 --> 01:00:19,680
which signalled the Revolution.

758
01:00:21,006 --> 01:00:27,287
The next revolution shall begin with a few
gentle phrases of Johann Sebastian Bach.

759
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:34,062
Or maybe with some of the jazz
you play so beautifully.

760
01:00:35,712 --> 01:00:38,630
Yes, a little Sidney Bechet.

761
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,361
It's time.

762
01:00:51,061 --> 01:00:53,020
Da?

763
01:00:59,998 --> 01:01:02,641
Got a present for you.
They asked me to give it to you.

764
01:01:02,762 --> 01:01:05,645
It tells you how to get in touch with them.
I'll try to...

765
01:01:05,768 --> 01:01:09,244
Have you learned nothing?
They are against you, and against me.

766
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:11,653
Those are not the decent people.

767
01:01:11,778 --> 01:01:15,905
How the hell do you know
who the decent people are any more?

768
01:01:16,027 --> 01:01:19,389
Come to England. Then you can
tell the world everything you want.

769
01:01:19,513 --> 01:01:22,111
You are wearing grey today, Barley.

770
01:01:23,921 --> 01:01:26,724
My father was sent to prison by grey men.

771
01:01:27,568 --> 01:01:32,252
He was murdered by men
who wore grey uniforms.

772
01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:39,267
Grey men ruined my beautiful profession,
and take care, or they will ruin you too.

773
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:46,199
Will you publish me?

774
01:01:46,322 --> 01:01:50,722
Or must I start again for my search
for a decent human being?

775
01:01:52,414 --> 01:01:54,213
No.

776
01:01:54,337 --> 01:01:56,296
I'm with you.

777
01:01:57,022 --> 01:01:59,221
I believe you're right.

778
01:02:07,401 --> 01:02:10,239
I dropped another notebook into your bag.

779
01:02:12,049 --> 01:02:14,363
Throw your friends a few bones.

780
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:19,419
Publish me.

781
01:02:56,450 --> 01:02:58,730
Barley. Welcome back.

782
01:02:58,855 --> 01:03:01,214
Nedski. Why aren't you working?

783
01:03:01,701 --> 01:03:05,382
I'm the red carpet.
And the bunting, and the brass band.

784
01:03:06,148 --> 01:03:08,347
Oh. You got the notebook.

785
01:03:09,074 --> 01:03:13,712
- Good stuff, was it?
- The best. You're the hero of the hour.

786
01:03:13,842 --> 01:03:15,802
You're a star.

787
01:03:16,287 --> 01:03:19,250
Where's Walter? Off with the boy scouts?

788
01:03:19,373 --> 01:03:23,089
Well, he's off the job, I'm afraid.
But he sends his love.

789
01:03:27,948 --> 01:03:30,706
The fourth notebook
is a deal-breaker.

790
01:03:31,555 --> 01:03:36,479
It's come-to-Jesus time for both sides
now, the hawks and the doves.

791
01:03:38,448 --> 01:03:41,843
The Agency has gotta
get off the fence, Russell.

792
01:04:21,927 --> 01:04:25,050
Only three weeks old,
and already a classic.

793
01:04:27,057 --> 01:04:30,020
Feel the weight of all the expert opinions.

794
01:04:32,305 --> 01:04:36,148
- Is there a conclusion?
- Clive, there is a conclusion.

795
01:04:37,235 --> 01:04:40,438
Drop it down the toilet,
and your guy with it.

796
01:04:45,169 --> 01:04:46,925
Ned?

797
01:04:52,063 --> 01:04:55,299
- Is that what you think, Russell?
- What I think?

798
01:04:55,429 --> 01:05:00,353
Well, expert opinion has it that
this notebook was written very quickly,

799
01:05:00,478 --> 01:05:04,524
or very slowly, by a man or a woman,
in anger or in jest.

800
01:05:04,645 --> 01:05:08,965
The writer was right- or left-handed.
He was a scientist and a non-scientist.

801
01:05:09,094 --> 01:05:11,053
What I think?

802
01:05:11,618 --> 01:05:14,501
For experts, there's no toilet deep enough.

803
01:05:16,908 --> 01:05:18,468
Good for you, Russell.

804
01:05:18,590 --> 01:05:22,717
The trouble is,
a lot of highly paid favourite sons

805
01:05:22,839 --> 01:05:26,076
are in danger of having their
rice bowls broken and going hungry,

806
01:05:26,204 --> 01:05:29,202
all on account
of these goddamn notebooks.

807
01:05:31,054 --> 01:05:35,738
The Russian military effort is stalled,
the American military effort is stalled.

808
01:05:35,863 --> 01:05:40,627
Their rocket motors suck instead of blow,
their ICBMs can't get out of their kennels,

809
01:05:40,752 --> 01:05:44,114
their scientists can't do
solid fuel for shit...

810
01:05:44,599 --> 01:05:47,323
Our customers don't like to hear that.

811
01:05:50,650 --> 01:05:54,570
Jesus Christ. I have to come
all this way to tell you this?

812
01:05:58,665 --> 01:06:00,818
And yet here you are.

813
01:06:01,910 --> 01:06:03,984
And yet here I am.

814
01:06:04,915 --> 01:06:07,355
Clive, Ned, I'll tell you something.

815
01:06:07,761 --> 01:06:10,485
I am an honest-to-God glasnostic.

816
01:06:11,247 --> 01:06:16,046
I was born a glasnostic. My parents
are old glasnostics from way back.

817
01:06:16,938 --> 01:06:20,253
My children will be raised as glasnostics -
although I don't have any.

818
01:06:20,384 --> 01:06:25,627
And I really believe that Dante
is a source from glasnost heaven.

819
01:06:27,958 --> 01:06:31,799
I can't look away. He'll invade my sleep.

820
01:06:32,887 --> 01:06:36,408
And for the rest of my fucking life
I'll be hearing him say

821
01:06:36,533 --> 01:06:40,933
"Russell, you had it in your hand.
Ned gave it to you."

822
01:06:44,909 --> 01:06:46,710
Honour is due, Ned.

823
01:06:52,444 --> 01:06:55,246
- You won't regret it, Russell.
- You might.

824
01:06:56,490 --> 01:06:58,485
We wanna meet your Mr Barley.

825
01:06:58,614 --> 01:07:02,135
In the back room,
with the lights in his eyes.

826
01:07:22,096 --> 01:07:26,017
Mr Blair,
you have all the attributes.

827
01:07:26,145 --> 01:07:29,268
Generosity, wit, courtesy,

828
01:07:29,992 --> 01:07:33,877
sang-froid, saxophone and reckless folly.

829
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:39,000
So... what in the hell takes you
to Russia every five minutes?

830
01:07:39,890 --> 01:07:42,853
Are you, uh... buying property over there?

831
01:07:44,699 --> 01:07:46,134
That's a fair question.

832
01:07:46,261 --> 01:07:50,022
Fuck whether it's a fair question.
Just tell us the answer.

833
01:07:52,432 --> 01:07:54,393
I love the place.

834
01:07:54,517 --> 01:07:56,476
It draws me.

835
01:07:59,446 --> 01:08:01,405
It's such a shambles.

836
01:08:02,291 --> 01:08:05,129
They try so hard, from so far back...

837
01:08:05,937 --> 01:08:08,775
Poor buggers.
They just want to be like us.

838
01:08:10,947 --> 01:08:15,426
They have this huge heart
and... huge ignorance.

839
01:08:17,117 --> 01:08:19,272
And they always keep their word.

840
01:08:19,402 --> 01:08:21,601
Ugh... Acorns!

841
01:08:22,408 --> 01:08:25,372
They're gathering acorns
and making coffee from them!

842
01:08:25,494 --> 01:08:27,249
That's what they're doing here.

843
01:08:27,377 --> 01:08:32,585
Mr Blair, we are buying a Picasso. OK?

844
01:08:33,708 --> 01:08:36,351
You don't mind
an occasional metaphor, do you?

845
01:08:36,473 --> 01:08:38,593
- Not at all.
- Good.

846
01:08:39,038 --> 01:08:43,244
Some people don't like my metaphors.
I don't know why, but...

847
01:08:43,366 --> 01:08:47,525
Anyway, everyone in this room
is buying the same Picasso.

848
01:08:48,175 --> 01:08:52,779
It's, uh, very rare.
Medium rare, well done. What the fuck?

849
01:08:52,903 --> 01:08:56,300
The bottom-line question is
"Did Picasso paint it?"

850
01:08:57,192 --> 01:09:00,155
And you're the man who is selling it to us.

851
01:09:00,798 --> 01:09:03,111
It is not my Picasso, Russell.

852
01:09:04,004 --> 01:09:07,970
It is not my Picasso.
And I'm not saying it is a Picasso.

853
01:09:08,532 --> 01:09:11,289
And furthermore, I'm not selling it to you.

854
01:09:12,059 --> 01:09:16,298
And lastly, I don't give a fuck
whether you buy it or not.

855
01:09:27,087 --> 01:09:31,406
Quinn is army from the anus up.
He likes plain answers.

856
01:09:33,297 --> 01:09:35,531
I'll tell Barley.

857
01:09:37,585 --> 01:09:41,221
Have you ever had any homosexual
experiences, Mr Blair?

858
01:09:42,073 --> 01:09:45,037
Just the usual adolescent hand-held job.

859
01:09:46,081 --> 01:09:48,394
Same as yourself, I suppose?

860
01:09:49,728 --> 01:09:52,530
- Has this man been fluttered?
- What's that?

861
01:09:52,652 --> 01:09:55,616
Lie detector. No, Colonel, he hasn't.

862
01:09:58,063 --> 01:10:00,662
Your background is fairly liberal,
isn't it, Mr Blair?

863
01:10:00,788 --> 01:10:03,260
- Background?
- Your father.

864
01:10:03,393 --> 01:10:07,952
No. My father hated liberals.
He took the communist line mainly.

865
01:10:09,443 --> 01:10:11,597
Your father died eight years ago?

866
01:10:11,728 --> 01:10:12,639
Yes.

867
01:10:12,769 --> 01:10:16,690
Which is about the time your visits
to the Soviet Union became pretty regular.

868
01:10:16,817 --> 01:10:20,533
- I hadn't made the connection.
- Have you formed any connection

869
01:10:20,664 --> 01:10:25,349
with any peaceniks, dissidents
or other unofficial groups of that nature?

870
01:10:26,355 --> 01:10:29,877
You meet all sorts.
Jazz people, book people...

871
01:10:30,002 --> 01:10:33,079
That's an impossible question. I'm sorry.

872
01:10:33,608 --> 01:10:37,733
Well, let me turn that around and ask if
you've made any connection, whatsoever,

873
01:10:37,855 --> 01:10:39,770
with any peace people in England?

874
01:10:39,899 --> 01:10:43,979
Oh, hundreds, I should think.
You have to stay indoors to avoid them.

875
01:10:44,107 --> 01:10:46,387
Are there any musicians
you fraternise with

876
01:10:46,512 --> 01:10:51,436
whom you would describe, or who would
describe themselves, as anarchists?

877
01:10:54,085 --> 01:10:56,444
Ah. There was a trombone player.

878
01:10:58,413 --> 01:11:00,807
Wilfred Baker was his name.

879
01:11:01,259 --> 01:11:03,493
He's the only jazz musician I can recall

880
01:11:03,623 --> 01:11:07,224
who was completely devoid
of anarchist tendencies.

881
01:11:10,515 --> 01:11:13,958
Do you disapprove of the English
social structure, Mr Blair?

882
01:11:14,281 --> 01:11:17,759
Absolutely. Give me America every time.

883
01:11:18,129 --> 01:11:20,250
- Thank you, Mr Blair.
- Not at all.

884
01:11:20,374 --> 01:11:23,975
But you seem to go to Russia
rather more than you come to America.

885
01:11:24,101 --> 01:11:26,778
Yes. Because I prefer Russia.

886
01:11:28,268 --> 01:11:33,306
It's as corrupt as America, but...
there's less bullshit.

887
01:11:37,846 --> 01:11:42,848
He acted like a man who's going
his own way. Wouldn't you say?

888
01:11:45,379 --> 01:11:49,539
I'd say he behaved like someone
who didn't need to be careful.

889
01:11:50,509 --> 01:11:52,469
He might have.

890
01:11:53,233 --> 01:11:57,359
Oh, Ren? Mr Blair likes to have
a bottle of Scotch in his room.

891
01:11:58,683 --> 01:12:00,678
After his cricket.

892
01:12:03,132 --> 01:12:05,286
- Very good.
- That was nearly a six.

893
01:12:05,697 --> 01:12:06,973
Mr Brady, Barley.

894
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:10,177
Looks like you've done
a fine thing, Barley.

895
01:12:10,305 --> 01:12:12,982
Anybody say thank you along the way?

896
01:12:13,110 --> 01:12:14,625
No.

897
01:12:14,752 --> 01:12:18,548
Did I read somewhere you once played
in the great Ray Noble's band?

898
01:12:18,681 --> 01:12:21,324
Ah. A beardless boy in those days, Brady.

899
01:12:21,967 --> 01:12:24,040
Wasn't Ray the sweetest man
you ever met?

900
01:12:24,171 --> 01:12:25,845
Ray was a prince.

901
01:12:25,973 --> 01:12:28,252
Did you ever play chess with him?

902
01:12:28,818 --> 01:12:31,816
- As a matter of fact, I did.
- Who won?

903
01:12:32,546 --> 01:12:34,906
- I did.
- So did I.

904
01:12:44,367 --> 01:12:49,167
Close your eyes, please.
No undue excitation of any kind.

905
01:12:49,296 --> 01:12:51,097
Always answer truthfully.

906
01:13:01,118 --> 01:13:03,637
Answers to be "yes" or "no" only.

907
01:13:03,763 --> 01:13:05,723
Merv.

908
01:13:06,247 --> 01:13:08,207
Is your name Blair?

909
01:13:08,571 --> 01:13:10,611
Scott Blair.

910
01:13:10,735 --> 01:13:14,017
- Is your name Scott Blair?
- Yes.

911
01:13:20,553 --> 01:13:21,510
No.

912
01:13:21,636 --> 01:13:23,870
- I am being blackmailed.
- No.

913
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,199
I am being coerced.

914
01:13:26,324 --> 01:13:27,475
Yes.

915
01:13:27,607 --> 01:13:29,406
By the Soviets?

916
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:30,567
No.

917
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:38,494
I am operating in collusion
with the woman Katya Orlova.

918
01:13:38,627 --> 01:13:40,108
No.

919
01:13:40,229 --> 01:13:42,224
Yes. What do you mean?

920
01:13:42,354 --> 01:13:44,712
- Hold it.
- Don't break the rhythm, Mr Blair.

921
01:13:44,838 --> 01:13:49,044
We have people do that on purpose
just to shake off a bad question.

922
01:13:49,166 --> 01:13:52,130
I am operating on behalf
of the Soviet Union.

923
01:13:52,252 --> 01:13:55,215
- No.
- In collusion with Katya Orlova.

924
01:13:55,338 --> 01:13:58,255
- No.
- I am the lover of Katya Orlova.

925
01:13:59,144 --> 01:13:59,861
No.

926
01:13:59,986 --> 01:14:03,302
I am motivated
by my love for Katya Orlova.

927
01:14:03,832 --> 01:14:05,509
No.

928
01:14:11,687 --> 01:14:13,646
Get rid of him, Clive.

929
01:14:15,053 --> 01:14:19,100
He's wrong for us.
Put in a professional. One of our people.

930
01:14:19,701 --> 01:14:23,178
If Dante's a good boy,
he gets the jackpot. I'll see to it.

931
01:14:23,309 --> 01:14:26,671
A million's no problem.
Ten million's even better.

932
01:14:26,795 --> 01:14:30,032
That way Dante's a traitor
our patriots can understand.

933
01:14:30,161 --> 01:14:34,765
Dante won't deal with a professional.
He won't be bribed or threatened.

934
01:14:34,889 --> 01:14:37,774
He's straight. Do you remember straight?

935
01:14:38,416 --> 01:14:41,653
Nobody hired us
for our brotherly love, Ned.

936
01:14:47,111 --> 01:14:49,071
Russell.

937
01:14:52,523 --> 01:14:54,835
- Brady?
- Clive?

938
01:14:56,209 --> 01:14:58,204
Is there a seat on your plane?

939
01:14:58,332 --> 01:15:00,292
Of course.

940
01:15:19,572 --> 01:15:21,531
Barley?

941
01:15:23,339 --> 01:15:25,298
Barley?

942
01:15:27,346 --> 01:15:29,305
You've won!

943
01:15:32,235 --> 01:15:34,673
You've beaten their whole apparatus.

944
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:37,360
There'll be no turning back now.

945
01:15:37,684 --> 01:15:40,808
Well done, Ned Jolly good show.

946
01:15:42,454 --> 01:15:47,490
Well, that's what you want, isn't it?
To go back to Moscow. To see it through.

947
01:15:49,786 --> 01:15:51,940
Three cheers for our side.

948
01:15:59,204 --> 01:16:02,600
Blair stays, and Langley
are taking over the case.

949
01:16:02,730 --> 01:16:05,295
They're preparing
a shopping list for Dante.

950
01:16:05,415 --> 01:16:09,257
It'll be the list to end all lists.
A grand-slam questionnaire.

951
01:16:09,383 --> 01:16:12,540
Pentagon, Defense, State...
Endorsed by the president.

952
01:16:12,669 --> 01:16:15,141
You made them a present of my joe?

953
01:16:15,675 --> 01:16:19,309
The role of the Russia House
will be respected. Russell values the link.

954
01:16:19,441 --> 01:16:22,962
We're taking over Barley's resettlement
and his pension, Ned.

955
01:16:23,087 --> 01:16:25,448
You gave away my joe for his pension?

956
01:16:25,573 --> 01:16:28,172
We're on the same bloody side,
aren't we?

957
01:16:28,297 --> 01:16:32,423
God, this is a list of questions that could
unlock all the Sov military secrets

958
01:16:32,545 --> 01:16:34,540
and win the arms race at a stroke!

959
01:16:34,668 --> 01:16:38,065
Or lose it. I don't like lists, Clive.

960
01:16:38,436 --> 01:16:41,239
Lists tell you too much
about the people who make them.

961
01:16:41,361 --> 01:16:44,439
I think you'll enjoy our facility.

962
01:16:44,567 --> 01:16:47,484
Bloody marvellous.
Blair's tapes encrypted,

963
01:16:47,613 --> 01:16:51,852
bounced by satellite to London,
then decrypted - all in minutes.

964
01:17:04,042 --> 01:17:06,402
Ah, Vladimir.

965
01:17:06,527 --> 01:17:10,003
You know my partner, JP Henziger?
No, you don't? You should.

966
01:17:10,134 --> 01:17:13,291
- Leonard Wicklow, my associate.
- Jack Henziger.

967
01:17:13,421 --> 01:17:15,335
Spikey! They let you in again?

968
01:17:15,464 --> 01:17:18,222
- Not bankrupt yet?
- No. Close, but no cigar. Here.

969
01:17:18,349 --> 01:17:21,187
- Party on Thursday. Live music.
- Hey.

970
01:17:22,356 --> 01:17:24,874
Bit early in the day even for me, George.

971
01:17:25,001 --> 01:17:27,042
Er, Leonard Wicklow, JP Henziger.

972
01:17:27,166 --> 01:17:29,638
- Brought your saxophone?
- But of course.

973
01:17:29,810 --> 01:17:35,178
Alik. A cordial invitation from
Potomac Blair to a party on Thursday.

974
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:38,024
- So what was so important in Leningrad?
- Come on.

975
01:17:38,145 --> 01:17:40,948
You don't care about Leningrad, do you?

976
01:17:41,070 --> 01:17:43,305
I'm sorry I disappeared. Here.

977
01:17:44,357 --> 01:17:47,594
If she was young and beautiful,
I forgive you.

978
01:17:51,129 --> 01:17:54,810
It is so good, Barley.
Really, it is so good to see you.

979
01:17:55,817 --> 01:17:58,781
Welcome to Moscow again.
Welcome to the book fair.

980
01:17:58,903 --> 01:18:01,182
To hell with the book fair.

981
01:18:28,077 --> 01:18:30,356
This is too beautiful to wear.

982
01:18:48,033 --> 01:18:50,757
She is asking... are you married?

983
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:53,994
No. Not at present.

984
01:18:54,365 --> 01:18:57,407
But tell her that I'm always open to offers.

985
01:19:27,745 --> 01:19:30,390
Lapta! Lapta!

986
01:19:31,473 --> 01:19:33,546
Baseball, cricket...

987
01:19:33,677 --> 01:19:35,796
What's he saying?

988
01:19:35,921 --> 01:19:39,398
Matvey assures me lapta is the origin

989
01:19:39,527 --> 01:19:42,605
of American baseball
and your English cricket.

990
01:19:42,733 --> 01:19:45,857
He believes it was introduced to you
by Russian immigrants.

991
01:19:45,980 --> 01:19:49,581
Well, if that's true,
it's the end of the British Empire.

992
01:20:04,173 --> 01:20:05,894
Now, my news.

993
01:20:06,016 --> 01:20:09,298
After your meeting with Yakov
he missed his next phone call.

994
01:20:09,422 --> 01:20:11,462
I was very worried. But it is all right.

995
01:20:11,586 --> 01:20:15,872
Yakov wrote me a long letter.
He was ill, but he has recovered.

996
01:20:15,994 --> 01:20:20,758
He will make a special visit to Moscow
during the book fair to meet you.

997
01:20:20,883 --> 01:20:23,322
- How was he ill?
- With gipetit.

998
01:20:24,409 --> 01:20:28,375
I... Prasti. Sorry. Er, hepatitis?

999
01:20:28,937 --> 01:20:30,693
I will read it to you.

1000
01:20:30,821 --> 01:20:33,705
It arrived eight days ago.
Igor telephoned at my house.

1001
01:20:33,827 --> 01:20:36,825
- Who's Igor?
- A trusted friend of Yakov.

1002
01:20:36,952 --> 01:20:41,557
He telephoned. He said "I have some
medicine for you." Medicine is a letter.

1003
01:20:41,681 --> 01:20:45,475
I thought he didn't have
any trusted friends except you.

1004
01:20:45,608 --> 01:20:47,808
What does he do, this Igor?

1005
01:20:48,494 --> 01:20:52,130
He is a scientist like Yakov,
at one of the ministries.

1006
01:20:52,622 --> 01:20:56,507
What does it matter? Do you wish me
to translate Yakov's letter or not?

1007
01:20:56,628 --> 01:20:58,588
Go on.

1008
01:20:59,954 --> 01:21:03,841
He is in a special hospital,
perhaps in a special town.

1009
01:21:03,963 --> 01:21:05,398
What town?

1010
01:21:05,525 --> 01:21:10,368
Some of our towns have no names,
even today. Only postal numbers.

1011
01:21:13,579 --> 01:21:15,699
"My darling Katya..."

1012
01:21:20,953 --> 01:21:24,840
He writes love talk. I shall not translate.

1013
01:21:25,882 --> 01:21:27,638
Does he usually do that?

1014
01:21:27,765 --> 01:21:31,002
What "usually"?
It is not usually he writes to me.

1015
01:21:31,492 --> 01:21:33,487
Ah, now we come to you.

1016
01:21:38,907 --> 01:21:44,787
"Please tell our good friend that I shall
try my best to see him during his visit."

1017
01:21:44,917 --> 01:21:50,001
"I will bring more material. If he has
a message for me, he must tell you."

1018
01:21:52,411 --> 01:21:54,451
Do you have a message?

1019
01:21:54,976 --> 01:21:56,935
No. No.

1020
01:21:58,262 --> 01:22:00,655
"Tell him to bring all further questions,

1021
01:22:00,786 --> 01:22:04,867
because after this I do not wish
to answer any more questions."

1022
01:22:04,995 --> 01:22:09,074
"Tell him his list should be final and..."

1023
01:22:11,325 --> 01:22:13,445
Like... complete.

1024
01:22:14,611 --> 01:22:16,047
Comprehensive?

1025
01:22:16,174 --> 01:22:19,252
Yes. Comprehensive.

1026
01:22:19,660 --> 01:22:21,621
Com... Comprehensive.

1027
01:22:22,146 --> 01:22:24,300
Full marks.

1028
01:22:32,925 --> 01:22:38,089
He says "Please bring
a sample page of translation,

1029
01:22:38,215 --> 01:22:40,733
but in print, please, if you can."

1030
01:22:41,381 --> 01:22:45,427
"Tell me publishing dates.
Which is the best season?"

1031
01:22:45,548 --> 01:22:46,539
Um...

1032
01:22:46,670 --> 01:22:49,985
"Please make your suggestions
for a title."

1033
01:22:50,637 --> 01:22:55,961
"Will there be an introduction to the
book? Who will write the... digest?"

1034
01:22:58,291 --> 01:23:00,525
Er, the blurb.

1035
01:23:02,058 --> 01:23:03,779
Blurb?

1036
01:23:03,901 --> 01:23:05,861
Yes, the blurb.

1037
01:23:08,431 --> 01:23:10,390
Blurb?!

1038
01:23:10,915 --> 01:23:12,510
Oh!

1039
01:23:15,483 --> 01:23:19,085
Er, it's a war wound.
It's very good. You must tell her.

1040
01:23:19,210 --> 01:23:21,682
- You tell her.
- Fantastic.

1041
01:23:41,010 --> 01:23:43,370
When do you speak to Yakov again?

1042
01:23:46,139 --> 01:23:49,980
You cannot come to the hospital, Barley.
It is not safe.

1043
01:23:50,707 --> 01:23:53,910
If it's not safe for me,
then it's not safe for you.

1044
01:23:56,358 --> 01:23:59,481
- How does he end his letter?
- That is not for you.

1045
01:24:00,325 --> 01:24:04,006
- More love talk, hm?
- Barley, I think it is clear to hedgehog

1046
01:24:04,132 --> 01:24:06,696
that you are being a little childish.

1047
01:24:09,623 --> 01:24:11,662
Which hedgehog?

1048
01:24:12,507 --> 01:24:14,742
Why does he write like that?

1049
01:24:15,994 --> 01:24:19,914
He is lonely. He exaggerates
his feelings. It is normal.

1050
01:24:23,327 --> 01:24:24,889
Yeah.

1051
01:24:25,331 --> 01:24:27,291
It's normal.

1052
01:24:45,087 --> 01:24:47,845
That's it! No more! No more fucking tapes!

1053
01:24:59,995 --> 01:25:02,958
Final and comprehensive list. Why?

1054
01:25:03,961 --> 01:25:06,001
He's nervous. Why not?

1055
01:25:06,646 --> 01:25:08,801
Maybe I don't mind the list.

1056
01:25:08,930 --> 01:25:11,496
Maybe I mind him
writing her chatty letters.

1057
01:25:11,616 --> 01:25:13,576
People do when they've been ill.

1058
01:25:13,700 --> 01:25:17,986
Maybe I mind the red car and
the white car. You saw the watch report.

1059
01:25:18,108 --> 01:25:20,501
And Igor. Igor who? Igor when?

1060
01:25:20,632 --> 01:25:22,432
Ned, Ned, Ned, Ned, Ned!

1061
01:25:24,318 --> 01:25:28,285
It's early days. We're all jumpy.

1062
01:25:48,283 --> 01:25:49,843
Katya, Katya.

1063
01:25:49,965 --> 01:25:54,570
Did you know Agatha Christie?
Matvey is crazy for detective fiction.

1064
01:25:54,694 --> 01:25:57,612
Alas, Agatha and I were never introduced.

1065
01:25:57,740 --> 01:26:01,866
Raymond Chandler,
Dorothy Sayers, Conan Doyle...

1066
01:26:05,635 --> 01:26:07,708
Leningrad.

1067
01:26:07,839 --> 01:26:09,798
Family.

1068
01:26:10,523 --> 01:26:12,519
Family. Da.

1069
01:26:22,666 --> 01:26:24,820
What's he saying now?

1070
01:26:33,686 --> 01:26:36,124
He is talking about the siege.

1071
01:26:39,176 --> 01:26:44,180
The Germans were four kilometres
from Leningrad on the south side.

1072
01:26:44,305 --> 01:26:46,584
- I love you.
- You can still see...

1073
01:26:47,471 --> 01:26:53,078
the marks of the machine-gun fire
in the old buildings in the outskirts.

1074
01:26:53,201 --> 01:26:54,478
I love you.

1075
01:26:54,604 --> 01:26:58,000
All my failings were
preparations for meeting you.

1076
01:26:59,734 --> 01:27:03,893
The city refused to... accept defeat.

1077
01:27:04,463 --> 01:27:09,340
- Shostakovich still composed music...
- It's like nothing I have ever known.

1078
01:27:10,393 --> 01:27:11,954
It's...

1079
01:27:12,957 --> 01:27:16,354
unselfish love. Grown-up love.

1080
01:27:16,485 --> 01:27:18,719
- You know it is.
- Barley, please.

1081
01:27:18,849 --> 01:27:20,888
It's mature, absolute,

1082
01:27:22,655 --> 01:27:24,854
thrilling love.

1083
01:27:26,502 --> 01:27:29,262
You have bewitched my family.

1084
01:27:29,749 --> 01:27:35,516
My children think all you British are now
Santa Claus in beautiful tweed clothes.

1085
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:40,446
There's no Santa Claus.
And nobody is what he seems.

1086
01:27:40,568 --> 01:27:42,528
Except you.

1087
01:27:43,253 --> 01:27:47,220
Why do you want to take away my rights?
Go and sit down.

1088
01:27:54,353 --> 01:27:59,231
I hope you are not being frivolous, Barley.
My life now only has room for truth.

1089
01:28:10,022 --> 01:28:11,822
- What are you doing?
- Shh.

1090
01:28:48,012 --> 01:28:50,372
I'm with you.

1091
01:29:14,380 --> 01:29:16,339
I know it now.

1092
01:29:56,017 --> 01:29:58,329
A final and comprehensive list.

1093
01:29:59,142 --> 01:30:01,741
One chance, then close down.

1094
01:30:03,189 --> 01:30:04,147
Why?

1095
01:30:04,272 --> 01:30:07,155
I really think you should get some sleep.

1096
01:30:07,277 --> 01:30:10,434
- I don't think I'm tired.
- Oh, I think you are.

1097
01:30:11,044 --> 01:30:12,800
I think you're tired as hell.

1098
01:30:12,927 --> 01:30:17,292
If the Sovs were playing Dante back at us,
they wouldn't close him down.

1099
01:30:17,415 --> 01:30:20,778
You wouldn't close him down
if you were Sov, would you?

1100
01:30:20,903 --> 01:30:23,137
I might have to
if my methods were Russian.

1101
01:30:23,266 --> 01:30:24,828
Why?

1102
01:30:25,470 --> 01:30:28,752
Because Dante may not
be presentable any more.

1103
01:30:29,437 --> 01:30:34,042
He may not be able to use the telephone.
He may not be able to use a spoon.

1104
01:30:36,051 --> 01:30:38,010
He may be dead.

1105
01:30:39,296 --> 01:30:42,738
Dante is going to phone Katya
at the hospital today.

1106
01:30:43,503 --> 01:30:46,581
If he does that, will you shut the fuck up?

1107
01:30:47,951 --> 01:30:50,150
Or stay out of my operation?

1108
01:30:54,885 --> 01:30:57,278
You must be very quiet.

1109
01:30:57,809 --> 01:31:02,413
If the children come, we must dress
and we must be very serious.

1110
01:31:03,259 --> 01:31:05,379
I'll tell them I love you.

1111
01:31:05,905 --> 01:31:07,864
I shall not interpret.

1112
01:31:08,951 --> 01:31:10,910
Can I tell you?

1113
01:31:11,555 --> 01:31:13,549
If you are quiet.

1114
01:31:13,679 --> 01:31:15,638
Will you interpret?

1115
01:31:21,293 --> 01:31:23,653
You are my only country now.

1116
01:31:45,016 --> 01:31:46,976
Sorry I'm late.

1117
01:33:10,173 --> 01:33:11,813
Da?

1118
01:33:13,378 --> 01:33:14,415
Are you connected?

1119
01:33:15,542 --> 01:33:17,741
- Bingo.
- We're in business.

1120
01:33:19,789 --> 01:33:22,149
What did he say? Tell me.

1121
01:33:26,964 --> 01:33:30,166
That's a neat fit.
Dante keeps it short.

1122
01:33:30,289 --> 01:33:32,807
Embracing?

1123
01:33:32,934 --> 01:33:34,893
They're happy.

1124
01:33:38,023 --> 01:33:40,383
- Why is he driving?
- Men like to drive women.

1125
01:33:40,508 --> 01:33:42,707
He's a male chauvinist.

1126
01:34:07,477 --> 01:34:10,998
- Your people saying he's still in the flat?
- You see what I see.

1127
01:34:29,918 --> 01:34:32,437
Come on, come on, where's the tape?

1128
01:34:35,127 --> 01:34:37,087
Geronimo.

1129
01:34:38,333 --> 01:34:41,536
Hello, Barley.
What do you think of Cy's lorry?

1130
01:34:41,659 --> 01:34:44,304
- Or "truck", as he calls it.
- It's very impressive.

1131
01:34:44,425 --> 01:34:46,738
- How'd it go, Barley?
- Good.

1132
01:34:46,869 --> 01:34:50,265
Well, we're bang on target, Paddy.
The meeting is on.

1133
01:34:50,476 --> 01:34:54,236
Dante's coming to Moscow on Friday.
He's borrowing that apartment.

1134
01:34:54,362 --> 01:34:56,722
- Well done. What time?
- 1800.

1135
01:34:56,847 --> 01:34:58,603
Good.

1136
01:34:59,332 --> 01:35:01,291
Anything unusual?

1137
01:35:01,817 --> 01:35:06,455
No. Nothing I couldn't handle.
But Katya's not as tough as she thought.

1138
01:35:07,466 --> 01:35:10,464
Wound herself up a bit, I think,
waiting for that phone call.

1139
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:14,640
But I gave her a cup of tea
and held her hand for a bit.

1140
01:35:17,205 --> 01:35:19,005
Well done.

1141
01:35:21,012 --> 01:35:23,166
Well done indeed.

1142
01:35:37,361 --> 01:35:39,117
Leo, good to see you.

1143
01:35:39,245 --> 01:35:41,444
How's Olga? Still eating?

1144
01:35:41,568 --> 01:35:43,324
How's your dog, Barley?

1145
01:35:43,453 --> 01:35:46,417
Arkady. I haven't got a dog.
Why do you ask?

1146
01:35:46,539 --> 01:35:50,619
Because it's safer to discuss one's dog,
I would say, than one's friends.

1147
01:35:50,746 --> 01:35:52,866
Getting careless in our excitement, huh?

1148
01:35:52,990 --> 01:35:56,432
The informants will have
a good harvest this season.

1149
01:35:57,919 --> 01:36:00,040
- Hello, Barley.
- Alik.

1150
01:36:35,148 --> 01:36:37,107
Katya.

1151
01:36:42,401 --> 01:36:45,442
- Are you well?
- Thank you, I am very well.

1152
01:36:47,250 --> 01:36:49,769
Now, who don't you know?

1153
01:36:57,788 --> 01:36:59,828
Comrades! Ladies and gentlemen!

1154
01:37:00,072 --> 01:37:03,390
To you, and to our
new partnership, welcome.

1155
01:37:04,040 --> 01:37:06,274
Let's make each other free.

1156
01:37:06,405 --> 01:37:09,607
And let's make each other rich.

1157
01:37:09,731 --> 01:37:11,726
We want Barley!

1158
01:37:11,854 --> 01:37:14,693
Barley! Give us a tune! Come on!

1159
01:37:15,781 --> 01:37:18,859
Barley! Barley! Barley! Barley!

1160
01:37:21,673 --> 01:37:26,710
Wickers, you've got a real publisher in
you. When this business is over, go for it.

1161
01:38:32,322 --> 01:38:34,362
- Why Zapadny?
- Ned!

1162
01:38:34,847 --> 01:38:38,847
Barley buys Soviet books.
He's keeping his cover in trim.

1163
01:38:47,429 --> 01:38:49,630
Call it off, Russell.

1164
01:38:51,838 --> 01:38:54,151
You're not tired. You're sick!

1165
01:38:54,723 --> 01:38:56,444
Pixie voices!

1166
01:38:56,566 --> 01:39:00,772
If Dante is blown, Katya's blown.
Why is she still walking around?

1167
01:39:00,894 --> 01:39:02,249
I don't know.

1168
01:39:02,376 --> 01:39:05,820
OK. If Dante's blown,
who was on the hospital phone?

1169
01:39:06,305 --> 01:39:07,261
I don't know.

1170
01:39:07,387 --> 01:39:09,460
If it wasn't Dante,
why didn't she tell Barley?

1171
01:39:09,591 --> 01:39:12,473
And if she did tell Barley,
why isn't Barley telling us?

1172
01:39:12,596 --> 01:39:14,111
I don't know.

1173
01:39:14,278 --> 01:39:16,923
Don't give us hunches. Give us facts.

1174
01:39:17,044 --> 01:39:20,886
You brought us into this. Don't jump
off the tiger at the first fucking stop!

1175
01:39:21,012 --> 01:39:22,846
It's over, Russell.

1176
01:39:23,096 --> 01:39:24,976
Dante is straight.

1177
01:39:25,099 --> 01:39:27,937
Those were your words,
and I loved you for them.

1178
01:39:28,304 --> 01:39:30,059
Ned.

1179
01:39:30,508 --> 01:39:32,503
He's blown.

1180
01:39:32,632 --> 01:39:35,471
We had him, but we lost him.

1181
01:39:35,919 --> 01:39:37,753
It's over.

1182
01:39:38,604 --> 01:39:43,402
And my joe's out there
telling us that he's bang on target.

1183
01:40:07,176 --> 01:40:10,139
This is the flat
where Dante is waiting.

1184
01:40:10,261 --> 01:40:14,057
You'll be glad to hear that
the lift was working this morning.

1185
01:40:14,188 --> 01:40:17,425
Fourth floor, green-painted door,
bang opposite the lift.

1186
01:40:17,555 --> 01:40:21,440
Right. Then in that case
this will be your window.

1187
01:40:22,324 --> 01:40:25,366
Now, when you get in,
let us see you at that window.

1188
01:40:26,452 --> 01:40:27,887
Good.

1189
01:40:28,014 --> 01:40:31,456
Jack will walk you halfway.
Then you're on your own.

1190
01:40:31,580 --> 01:40:36,025
Tell Dante you want to walk out
with as many answers as he can give you.

1191
01:40:37,431 --> 01:40:39,392
This is it. The shopping list.

1192
01:40:39,515 --> 01:40:43,754
You'll have to tell him to wet the pages.
The questions will float to the surface.

1193
01:40:43,883 --> 01:40:46,242
Uh, make sure you bring it back.

1194
01:40:47,529 --> 01:40:50,607
We think the whole thing
will take two hours. Three, for luck.

1195
01:40:50,735 --> 01:40:53,859
Tell him you want a date
for a final meeting to fill in the blanks.

1196
01:40:53,982 --> 01:40:58,028
And when you want to leave,
pull the curtain. We'll pick you up.

1197
01:40:58,149 --> 01:40:59,665
How's that?

1198
01:40:59,792 --> 01:41:01,752
Good.

1199
01:41:01,876 --> 01:41:06,001
Give this to Ned, will you?
Just in case something goes wrong.

1200
01:41:07,085 --> 01:41:09,284
Nothing's going wrong.

1201
01:41:28,645 --> 01:41:31,687
That's it over there. Second from the right.

1202
01:41:44,354 --> 01:41:46,508
You'll be fine from here, Barley.

1203
01:41:47,960 --> 01:41:49,920
Fingers crossed, Jack.

1204
01:41:50,645 --> 01:41:52,604
Cheerio.

1205
01:42:17,655 --> 01:42:19,614
Thank you.

1206
01:42:26,111 --> 01:42:29,792
Sir, the shopping list...
It's only questions, isn't it?

1207
01:42:29,917 --> 01:42:32,960
- It wouldn't tell anyone anything?
- Everything.

1208
01:42:33,604 --> 01:42:36,726
It would tell what we know
by telling what we don't know.

1209
01:42:36,849 --> 01:42:39,812
And it would tell
what we would most like to know.

1210
01:42:39,935 --> 01:42:43,491
If the Sovs get the list, we might as well
have published the notebooks,

1211
01:42:43,623 --> 01:42:46,060
just as Barley promised Dante.

1212
01:42:50,154 --> 01:42:52,353
Yes, I do know.

1213
01:42:54,161 --> 01:42:56,760
Barley's made a deal.

1214
01:42:56,887 --> 01:43:00,408
He's keeping his promise to Dante
in his own way.

1215
01:43:00,534 --> 01:43:02,927
And he's trying to save Katya.

1216
01:43:03,058 --> 01:43:05,132
- He's giving them the list!
- Come on, Ned.

1217
01:43:05,262 --> 01:43:08,384
The Sovs are just waiting
for Barley to give it to them.

1218
01:43:08,507 --> 01:43:10,308
Jesus Christ!

1219
01:43:16,924 --> 01:43:19,522
- Brock, signal the truck.
- Don't!

1220
01:43:19,648 --> 01:43:21,369
- Signal Paddy. Abort.
- Don't!

1221
01:43:30,909 --> 01:43:33,028
Looking good!

1222
01:43:33,153 --> 01:43:35,796
And he's coming back smiling.

1223
01:43:36,279 --> 01:43:38,717
And you can take a long, long vacation.

1224
01:43:40,606 --> 01:43:42,760
My joe's crossed over.

1225
01:44:37,791 --> 01:44:39,352
He went in.

1226
01:44:39,915 --> 01:44:41,910
He never came out.

1227
01:44:42,039 --> 01:44:43,999
About seven hours.

1228
01:44:44,564 --> 01:44:46,239
Yes, sir.

1229
01:44:53,300 --> 01:44:55,534
Shit city, Ned.

1230
01:45:03,358 --> 01:45:05,478
Honour is due.

1231
01:45:15,059 --> 01:45:18,820
Well, folks, better put
the chairs back on the tables.

1232
01:45:22,794 --> 01:45:24,753
Till next time.

1233
01:45:39,103 --> 01:45:41,417
Yekaterina Borisovna Orlova.

1234
01:45:41,548 --> 01:45:43,508
Yes. Katya.

1235
01:45:43,632 --> 01:45:49,319
- The letter was signed "Katya"?
- No, just the initial. "Your loving K."

1236
01:45:49,684 --> 01:45:53,285
British Intelligence showed you
the letter for the first time in Lisbon?

1237
01:45:53,410 --> 01:45:53,968
Yes.

1238
01:45:54,091 --> 01:45:58,490
And it referred to your first meeting
with Savelyev, whom you know as Dante?

1239
01:45:58,619 --> 01:46:00,853
Yes. At Peredelkino.

1240
01:46:00,983 --> 01:46:02,943
But Mrs Orlova was not at Peredelkino?

1241
01:46:03,068 --> 01:46:07,432
- As I keep telling you, I didn't meet her...
- Please. Allow me.

1242
01:46:08,197 --> 01:46:11,673
Did Savelyev arrive at Peredelkino
by himself or with others?

1243
01:46:11,804 --> 01:46:14,447
I don't know. Why don't you ask him?

1244
01:46:14,769 --> 01:46:17,652
Unfortunately,
Professor Savelyev is dead.

1245
01:46:17,774 --> 01:46:20,247
He became very ill with hepatitis.

1246
01:46:21,862 --> 01:46:25,099
A great loss to the Soviet
scientific community.

1247
01:46:26,149 --> 01:46:27,950
We all mourn him.

1248
01:46:31,679 --> 01:46:33,639
Me too.

1249
01:46:35,127 --> 01:46:38,489
I have nothing further
to add to what I have said.

1250
01:46:38,893 --> 01:46:42,050
You have the shopping list -
payment in full.

1251
01:46:43,021 --> 01:46:45,585
Yes. The celebrated list.

1252
01:46:46,306 --> 01:46:50,307
We have a deal.
I expect you to honour that deal.

1253
01:46:51,236 --> 01:46:54,233
Yes, I'm talking about honour,
not ideology.

1254
01:46:54,401 --> 01:46:59,724
I've left a letter behind me just in case
they don't know the difference.

1255
01:47:04,981 --> 01:47:07,375
Tell me about the letter.

1256
01:47:10,351 --> 01:47:13,587
"Dear Nedski, change of plan, old chum."

1257
01:47:15,119 --> 01:47:17,353
"Sorry I couldn't let you know."

1258
01:47:17,483 --> 01:47:20,367
"I thought you'd be onto me
if anyone was."

1259
01:47:21,611 --> 01:47:24,084
"But perhaps you taught me too well."

1260
01:47:24,977 --> 01:47:28,134
"Anyway, Dante is blown,
as you would say."

1261
01:47:30,147 --> 01:47:32,426
"His letter to Katya was a fake."

1262
01:47:33,352 --> 01:47:36,989
"His phone call to the hospital
was KGB-controlled."

1263
01:47:37,641 --> 01:47:40,638
"But Dante and Katya
had worked out a code."

1264
01:47:41,648 --> 01:47:43,847
What did he say?

1265
01:47:43,972 --> 01:47:45,567
Tell me.

1266
01:47:45,695 --> 01:47:49,411
He is taken. Yakov is taken.

1267
01:47:49,542 --> 01:47:52,187
"If he was caught,
he called her by the wrong name."

1268
01:47:52,308 --> 01:47:54,462
He used the wrong name.

1269
01:47:55,433 --> 01:47:59,719
If we are safe, he calls me Alina.
If... if he is caught, Maria.

1270
01:47:59,841 --> 01:48:01,961
He called me Maria.

1271
01:48:03,328 --> 01:48:05,971
He was telling me we are dead.

1272
01:48:17,073 --> 01:48:19,146
Give me the key.

1273
01:48:19,316 --> 01:48:23,877
"So there we were. And I was thinking
'Why haven't they arrested us?"'

1274
01:48:26,290 --> 01:48:28,569
"It took me a while to work it out."

1275
01:48:28,694 --> 01:48:32,090
"But of course!
They wanted the shopping list."

1276
01:48:32,942 --> 01:48:34,663
"So there was the crunch:

1277
01:48:34,785 --> 01:48:39,710
to save your precious secrets,
or to trade them for Katya and her family."

1278
01:48:39,835 --> 01:48:42,434
"The easiest decision I ever made."

1279
01:48:43,161 --> 01:48:46,797
"And if you wouldn't have done the same,
then you've learned nothing."

1280
01:48:46,927 --> 01:48:48,522
"Dante was right."

1281
01:48:48,651 --> 01:48:54,532
"The grey men are keeping alive the arms
race, which nobody is supposed to want."

1282
01:48:57,266 --> 01:49:01,347
"It's all over for the secrets game.
Your day is done, old boy."

1283
01:49:01,474 --> 01:49:03,673
"Publish and be safe."

1284
01:49:04,480 --> 01:49:08,366
I need to betray my country,
and I haven't got much time.

1285
01:49:09,810 --> 01:49:14,255
And don't tell me you don't know
who to get in touch with. Just do it, hm?

1286
01:49:18,144 --> 01:49:22,749
I want to meet them in the morning
and agree a contract. All right?

1287
01:49:27,081 --> 01:49:28,915
"I did my best for you, Ned."

1288
01:49:29,045 --> 01:49:32,247
"But now I have to do my best
for Dante, and for Katya."

1289
01:49:33,773 --> 01:49:35,972
Smile. You must smile.

1290
01:49:36,097 --> 01:49:39,221
They're watching us.
Your side and my side.

1291
01:49:40,226 --> 01:49:42,460
We're going to beat them both.

1292
01:49:46,597 --> 01:49:49,560
I can't save Yakov. Nothing can.

1293
01:49:52,528 --> 01:49:54,567
But you're safe.

1294
01:49:54,692 --> 01:49:57,770
The children are safe.
Uncle Matvey's safe.

1295
01:50:02,306 --> 01:50:04,265
I love you.

1296
01:50:04,951 --> 01:50:07,230
And I won't let you down.

1297
01:50:18,094 --> 01:50:22,858
"It was my first good contract.
Real people for unreal arguments."

1298
01:50:24,105 --> 01:50:26,705
"I got everything I wanted,

1299
01:50:26,831 --> 01:50:30,911
down to a safe passage for Wicklow,
Henziger and the others."

1300
01:50:33,042 --> 01:50:36,324
"No doubt there'll be
hell to pay at your end."

1301
01:50:37,489 --> 01:50:40,806
"But you shouldn't open
other people's letters."

1302
01:50:41,538 --> 01:50:44,501
"Love, and luck. Barley."

1303
01:50:48,831 --> 01:50:50,791
What about Russell?

1304
01:50:51,234 --> 01:50:53,469
Russell's a survivor.

1305
01:50:54,441 --> 01:50:58,043
Rumour has it that the shopping list
was really a brilliant deception,

1306
01:50:58,168 --> 01:51:00,641
planted on the Russians
by our clever Russell,

1307
01:51:00,773 --> 01:51:03,211
who also started the rumour.

1308
01:51:03,337 --> 01:51:08,181
If he can get the Sovs to believe it,
everything's back to square one.

1309
01:51:08,306 --> 01:51:10,619
Dante need never have bothered.

1310
01:51:11,873 --> 01:51:13,833
And Barley?

1311
01:51:14,638 --> 01:51:16,758
Oh, Barley.

1312
01:51:17,082 --> 01:51:20,205
He's home free. Back in Lisbon.

1313
01:51:20,328 --> 01:51:22,642
It's not a large flat, of course.

1314
01:51:23,453 --> 01:51:27,661
But by Moscow standards...
We'll all squeeze in.

1315
01:51:28,503 --> 01:51:30,897
Still backing your Russia, Barley?

1316
01:51:31,750 --> 01:51:33,709
Well, we'll see.

1317
01:51:33,833 --> 01:51:38,996
You know, I chose this flat because
I like to watch the ships come in.

1318
01:51:40,124 --> 01:51:43,248
I must have known
that one day it would be my ship.

1319
01:51:44,092 --> 01:51:47,090
And you think that Katya's
going to be on it?

1320
01:51:47,979 --> 01:51:50,373
Well, perhaps it's your due.

1321
01:51:50,503 --> 01:51:54,550
It took some guts. And you seem
to think you did the decent thing.

1322
01:51:57,918 --> 01:52:00,037
Good luck, Barley.

1323
01:52:26,449 --> 01:52:28,408
Katya!

1324
01:52:31,579 --> 01:52:33,539
Come on!

1325
01:52:36,548 --> 01:52:39,192
Come on, Katya! Come on!
