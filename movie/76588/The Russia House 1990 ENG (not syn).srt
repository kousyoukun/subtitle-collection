1
00:01:48,774 --> 00:01:51,577
Yekaterina Orlova.
Katya?

2
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,294
Never heard of her.

3
00:01:53,422 --> 00:01:58,632
The patronymic's Borisovna.
Katya Borisovna Orlova.

4
00:01:58,753 --> 00:02:01,477
- Have a think, Barley.
- Don't know a Katya.

5
00:02:01,598 --> 00:02:03,752
Never screwed one,
never flirted with one,

6
00:02:03,881 --> 00:02:07,278
never proposed to one,
never even married one.

7
00:02:07,407 --> 00:02:10,211
What is she, the usual fat-arsed frump?

8
00:02:11,775 --> 00:02:17,419
She visited the British Council's
audio fair in Moscow exactly a week ago.

9
00:02:17,547 --> 00:02:19,461
Audio fair?

10
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,668
Cassettes.
Books of the bloody future.

11
00:02:22,796 --> 00:02:26,956
- So why didn't you go?
- I can go. I can not go.

12
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:30,127
I'm my own man. But you wouldn't
know anything about that.

13
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:35,288
Crap, Barley. You rented
a stand, booked your hotel, your flight...

14
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:37,618
Why didn't you show up?

15
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:42,425
I have a board.
I have family shareholders.

16
00:02:42,552 --> 00:02:47,238
The firm's having withdrawal pains at the
bank, if it's any of your bloody business.

17
00:02:47,362 --> 00:02:49,321
It is.

18
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:55,525
Tell me something.
Do you know Niki Landau?

19
00:02:57,019 --> 00:03:00,176
Excuse me. Do you know
Mr Bartholomew Scott Blair?

20
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:05,024
Yeah, I know Niki. Short-arse Polish
cockney sales rep. Goes at it like a rabbit.

21
00:03:05,153 --> 00:03:07,831
Barley? Sure, I know Barley.

22
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:11,321
House of Abercrombie and Blair,
publishers, drunk or sober.

23
00:03:11,445 --> 00:03:13,325
A gent. One of the best.

24
00:03:13,449 --> 00:03:16,606
I must speak to Mr Scott Blair.
It is very urgent.

25
00:03:16,736 --> 00:03:18,331
He's not here, darling.

26
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:20,217
But he was not here yesterday.

27
00:03:20,243 --> 00:03:25,485
Mr Scott Blair never came. He's absent.
AWOL. Not among those present. Sorry.

28
00:03:26,312 --> 00:03:29,709
Irritating little sod.
I'm quite fond of him really.

29
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,284
I have an important manuscript for him.
It is for Mr Blair. Only for Mr Blair.

30
00:03:34,407 --> 00:03:39,331
Listen, I'm trying to make a living here.
And not for Mr Blair, love him as I may.

31
00:03:39,456 --> 00:03:43,298
Might one inquire
why she should ask Niki about you?

32
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:46,263
I don't know. I don't know her.

33
00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:48,589
So you know Niki,
but not Katya?

34
00:03:48,794 --> 00:03:51,266
Oh, now you're getting it, old boy.

35
00:03:54,524 --> 00:03:57,521
- Is that Scotch over there?
- Help yourself.

36
00:03:59,813 --> 00:04:01,773
Hold everything.

37
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,556
OK.

38
00:04:41,049 --> 00:04:43,966
You must be very kind and help me.

39
00:04:44,936 --> 00:04:49,302
A Russian friend of mine
has written an important novel.

40
00:04:49,426 --> 00:04:52,741
Its message is important
for all of mankind.

41
00:04:52,871 --> 00:04:54,022
Nice.

42
00:04:54,154 --> 00:04:58,678
In spite of glasnost, my friend's
novel cannot yet be published...

43
00:05:01,045 --> 00:05:02,242
in the Soviet Union.

44
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:07,167
Mr Scott Blair has undertaken
to publish it... with discretion.

45
00:05:07,298 --> 00:05:09,451
Don't worry. With Abercrombie and Blair,

46
00:05:09,582 --> 00:05:13,902
your friend's book is virtually guaranteed
to appear in total secrecy.

47
00:05:15,913 --> 00:05:22,445
If you love peace, please,
take this to England to Mr Scott Blair.

48
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:27,087
- It is a gift of trust.
- It is better that you smile.

49
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,895
- Excuse me?
- Smile.

50
00:05:30,019 --> 00:05:33,655
This is Anglo-Soviet cultural exchange.
We smile, we exchange culture.

51
00:05:33,787 --> 00:05:37,068
Looking scared is something different.
Got it in there, have we?

52
00:05:37,193 --> 00:05:40,509
This is dangerous for you.
You must believe in what you are doing.

53
00:05:40,638 --> 00:05:42,792
Smile.

54
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:46,161
We smile, we kiss. Formal Russian kiss.

55
00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:48,248
That's right.

56
00:05:48,894 --> 00:05:54,695
Now we've done it. You have brought me
an official farewell gift from...

57
00:05:55,426 --> 00:05:58,708
October Publishing
on the last day of the fair.

58
00:05:58,832 --> 00:06:03,630
And I have given you Shakespeare's
Sonnets for Careful Drivers.

59
00:06:06,086 --> 00:06:09,242
Would you... like
a nice dinner out somewhere?

60
00:06:11,014 --> 00:06:13,248
It is not convenient.

61
00:06:15,783 --> 00:06:17,937
Thank you.

62
00:06:18,067 --> 00:06:22,706
You can't think of any reason
why a book editor called Katya Orlova

63
00:06:22,836 --> 00:06:26,357
should risk her neck
to send you a manuscript?

64
00:06:33,454 --> 00:06:34,777
Barley?

65
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:41,059
Who said... "risk her neck"?

66
00:06:41,951 --> 00:06:43,911
I did.

67
00:06:45,998 --> 00:06:48,152
- Must be quite a book.
- It is.

68
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:51,361
- May I see it?
- Let's begin with the letter.

69
00:06:54,054 --> 00:06:58,213
"Personal. For Mr Bartholomew
Scott Blair. Urgent."

70
00:06:58,341 --> 00:07:02,627
We'd like to find out why a woman
you don't know should send you a letter

71
00:07:02,749 --> 00:07:06,989
beginning "My beloved Barley",
and sign herself "Your loving K".

72
00:07:07,117 --> 00:07:09,511
She's potty. Certifiable.

73
00:07:10,844 --> 00:07:12,725
Where is this manuscript?

74
00:07:12,848 --> 00:07:15,650
- That's none of your business.
- Like hell it isn't.

75
00:07:15,772 --> 00:07:17,767
She sent it to me as a publisher.

76
00:07:18,257 --> 00:07:22,463
- It's a bloody sight more mine than yours.
- Please calm down.

77
00:07:23,146 --> 00:07:25,345
It's in safe hands, Barley.

78
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:29,627
The manuscript was in three notebooks.

79
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,222
When Niki couldn't find you in London,
he had the sense to bring them to us.

80
00:07:35,691 --> 00:07:38,973
The first notebook is worthless,
scientifically speaking.

81
00:07:39,098 --> 00:07:39,895
Oh?

82
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:44,019
Peacenik manifestos, slogans,
poems, quotations.

83
00:07:44,146 --> 00:07:47,588
It has psychological interest, Minister,
in so far as the writer sounds...

84
00:07:47,713 --> 00:07:49,832
Absolutely barking.

85
00:07:49,956 --> 00:07:53,559
- Would you say?
- It's not a medical term, sir.

86
00:07:53,684 --> 00:07:55,564
Unstable, perhaps.

87
00:07:55,687 --> 00:07:59,003
- As for notebooks two and three?
- Genuine science.

88
00:07:59,213 --> 00:08:01,687
Written by someone in the business.
No question.

89
00:08:01,818 --> 00:08:03,095
The business?

90
00:08:03,221 --> 00:08:08,943
Destruction paths, payloads, aim points,
bias, rate of burn, trajectories, telemetry.

91
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:12,548
Of course, it doesn't necessarily
describe the true state of affairs.

92
00:08:12,679 --> 00:08:14,798
What the hell does it purport to describe?

93
00:08:14,922 --> 00:08:19,767
In a nutshell, the Soviet's strategic
capability for waging nuclear war.

94
00:08:21,374 --> 00:08:24,019
And addressed to boozy Barley Blair.

95
00:08:24,661 --> 00:08:28,546
Well, if it's strategic, we can't
evaluate it without the Americans.

96
00:08:28,668 --> 00:08:31,062
So it's their baby, not ours.

97
00:08:32,154 --> 00:08:36,313
- Throw Scott Blair to the Americans.
- Unfortunately, we haven't found him yet.

98
00:08:54,074 --> 00:08:56,309
Eureka! We've got him.

99
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,918
A Lisbon bank account, my dears!

100
00:09:00,566 --> 00:09:04,121
- We've got him.
- Lisbon.

101
00:09:05,735 --> 00:09:10,056
- Why did you run away?
- Run away? I own a flat here.

102
00:09:10,184 --> 00:09:13,067
Why Lisbon, Barley?

103
00:09:13,189 --> 00:09:15,310
Why Langley, Bob?

104
00:09:16,115 --> 00:09:17,949
You brought a woman?

105
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:22,158
What's it to you if I brought a woman,
a man or a fuckin' Muscovy duck?

106
00:09:22,686 --> 00:09:25,924
What do you do with yourself
in Lisbon, Barley?

107
00:09:26,053 --> 00:09:28,936
Well, I was having a drink.

108
00:09:29,299 --> 00:09:31,533
Until I was interrupted.

109
00:09:37,794 --> 00:09:39,710
- Mr Blair?
- Eh?

110
00:09:39,838 --> 00:09:44,716
I believe I'm addressing Mr Bartholomew
Scott Blair. Yes? Correct?

111
00:09:44,848 --> 00:09:47,526
- Yes.
- I'm Merrydew. I'm from the embassy.

112
00:09:47,652 --> 00:09:51,652
We received a rather urgent
message for you over our link.

113
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:54,458
Are you trying to tell me
someone's dead, old boy?

114
00:09:54,584 --> 00:09:57,583
No. That would be consular.
I'm commercial.

115
00:09:59,154 --> 00:10:02,516
Well, I never knew an honest debt
that couldn't wait till Monday.

116
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,843
Loosen your girdle, Merrydew.
Have a drink with the unwashed.

117
00:10:05,966 --> 00:10:10,651
I say, Blair, the man's the Queen's
emissary, for Christ's sake.

118
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:27,163
Have they moved the embassy, or are you
hijacking me? What's going on, tubby?

119
00:10:27,286 --> 00:10:30,681
- I'm commercial. Strictly commercial.
- Mr Blair, sir?

120
00:10:36,742 --> 00:10:38,896
My name's Ned.

121
00:10:39,027 --> 00:10:41,306
I'm about to move the goal posts.

122
00:10:41,431 --> 00:10:46,640
There's no urgent message. There's no
crisis in your affairs - beyond the usual.

123
00:10:46,761 --> 00:10:48,834
I'm from British Intelligence.

124
00:10:48,965 --> 00:10:51,119
Come and meet the others.

125
00:10:54,895 --> 00:10:56,936
This is Clive. This is Walter.

126
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:01,424
Over here is Bob, who is almost family.
Meet Barley, everyone.

127
00:11:01,548 --> 00:11:04,386
- Hello, Barley!
- Proud to know you, Barley.

128
00:11:04,513 --> 00:11:08,229
I'm the odd man out here. I work
for the Central Intelligence Agency,

129
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,646
which, as you probably know, is based
in Langley in the state of Virginia.

130
00:11:12,768 --> 00:11:15,652
Let's have some fun. Let's do some good.

131
00:11:15,774 --> 00:11:17,848
Now isn't that jolly?

132
00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:22,704
So, where are we all off to?
Nicaragua? Chile? Iran?

133
00:11:22,827 --> 00:11:25,425
Or are we just assassinating
some local nuisance?

134
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:28,117
Don't rant. Sit down.

135
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,401
Perhaps you can tell us
what this letter's all about.

136
00:11:48,314 --> 00:11:51,391
- Recognise the handwriting?
- Read it slowly.

137
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,912
Take all the time in the world, Barley.

138
00:11:55,607 --> 00:11:57,281
She's barmy.

139
00:12:01,017 --> 00:12:03,331
Who is she?

140
00:12:03,461 --> 00:12:06,345
Yekaterina Orlova. Katya?

141
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:11,067
- Never heard of her.
- The patronymic's Borisovna.

142
00:12:11,195 --> 00:12:15,880
Katya Borisovna Orlova.
Have a think, Barley.

143
00:12:16,004 --> 00:12:18,443
I don't know a Katya. Never screwed one,

144
00:12:18,569 --> 00:12:22,775
never flirted with one, never proposed
to one, never even married one.

145
00:12:22,897 --> 00:12:25,814
What is she, the usual fat-arsed frump?

146
00:12:25,942 --> 00:12:29,989
So, she wrote you a letter
signed "Your loving K",

147
00:12:31,032 --> 00:12:35,636
- and you tell me you don't know her?
- I told you. I never met the hag.

148
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,834
She's off her tree.

149
00:12:38,746 --> 00:12:40,900
She wasn't even there.

150
00:12:41,631 --> 00:12:44,548
- Where?
- At Peredelkino.

151
00:12:44,878 --> 00:12:47,157
It's a Soviet writers' village.

152
00:12:47,282 --> 00:12:51,886
They value their writers. The ones
who behave get their own dachas.

153
00:12:52,612 --> 00:12:54,971
I was lucky enough to be a guest.

154
00:12:55,658 --> 00:12:57,696
When was this?

155
00:12:57,821 --> 00:13:00,215
Three or four months ago.
One of my trips.

156
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:02,545
But there wasn't any Katya.

157
00:13:02,911 --> 00:13:05,476
- What happened?
- I was brilliant.

158
00:13:05,596 --> 00:13:08,160
- Yes?
- Oh, yes.

159
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:12,566
How to save the world between
lunch and dinner. I was flying.

160
00:13:13,169 --> 00:13:16,691
I believe in the new Russia.
You may not, but I do.

161
00:13:16,817 --> 00:13:21,694
20 years ago, it was just a pipe dream.
Today, it's our only hope.

162
00:13:23,348 --> 00:13:28,067
We thought we could bankrupt you
by raising the stakes in the arms race.

163
00:13:28,196 --> 00:13:30,191
Gambling with the fate of the human race.

164
00:13:30,321 --> 00:13:33,763
Barley, you won your gamble.
Nuclear peace for 40 years.

165
00:13:33,887 --> 00:13:35,609
Oh, rubbish. What peace?

166
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:40,016
Ask the Czechs, the Vietnamese,
the Koreans. Ask the Afghans.

167
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:44,504
No. If there is to be hope,
we must all betray our countries.

168
00:13:45,027 --> 00:13:49,827
We have to save each other,
because all victims are equal.

169
00:13:49,957 --> 00:13:52,715
And none is more equal than others.

170
00:13:53,724 --> 00:13:57,120
It's everyone's duty to start the avalanche.

171
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,891
A heroic thought, Barley.

172
00:13:59,013 --> 00:14:01,690
Listen, nowadays you have
to think like a hero

173
00:14:01,818 --> 00:14:05,340
just to behave like
a merely decent human being.

174
00:14:09,152 --> 00:14:11,954
And did you believe this nonsense?

175
00:14:12,077 --> 00:14:15,200
I don't know. I believe it when I say it.

176
00:14:15,884 --> 00:14:18,119
But you've got to be there.

177
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:24,136
You're taking a leak
in some filthy public urinal,

178
00:14:24,259 --> 00:14:28,340
and the man in the next stall leans across
and asks you about God, or Kafka,

179
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:31,270
or freedom versus responsibility.

180
00:14:31,392 --> 00:14:35,872
So you tell him. Because you know.
Because you're from the West.

181
00:14:36,963 --> 00:14:41,249
And before you've finished shaking your
dick, you think "What a great country."

182
00:14:41,371 --> 00:14:43,809
That's why I love them.

183
00:14:43,935 --> 00:14:46,214
And they're very fond of me.

184
00:14:47,943 --> 00:14:54,143
Anyway... later we talked about jazz,
and I played some.

185
00:14:54,755 --> 00:14:57,513
What, somebody had a saxophone?

186
00:14:57,641 --> 00:15:00,638
What else? Drum kit? Rhythm section?

187
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,834
How many women were there?

188
00:15:44,727 --> 00:15:47,120
Three or four. But no Katya.

189
00:15:49,054 --> 00:15:51,938
But there was someone, wasn't there?

190
00:15:54,385 --> 00:15:57,143
Yes. There was someone.

191
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:00,233
Someone who is the reason
why we're all here. Yes?

192
00:16:00,436 --> 00:16:02,430
- A man or a woman?
- Name?

193
00:16:03,521 --> 00:16:08,206
Christ. The way you people
come alive when you smell blood.

194
00:16:33,255 --> 00:16:35,615
They called him... Dante.

195
00:16:36,341 --> 00:16:38,097
As in "Inferno".

196
00:16:38,225 --> 00:16:42,145
The others said he was on holiday.
A drinking holiday.

197
00:16:42,432 --> 00:16:44,871
He worked some place
where drinking wasn't on.

198
00:16:45,397 --> 00:16:47,392
Everyone deferred to him.

199
00:16:47,522 --> 00:16:51,043
He never spoke.
He just got drunk and stared.

200
00:16:51,448 --> 00:16:54,653
- Stared?
- Mm. At me.

201
00:16:55,697 --> 00:16:58,421
Did Dante arrive on his own
or with others?

202
00:16:59,223 --> 00:17:01,218
I don't know.

203
00:17:01,347 --> 00:17:03,306
Keep going.

204
00:17:04,353 --> 00:17:07,590
Then I decided to give them all
a rest from wonderful me,

205
00:17:07,719 --> 00:17:10,078
let them talk Russian for a while.

206
00:17:10,204 --> 00:17:13,327
There's a graveyard
a couple of hundred yards up the hill.

207
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,762
It's a place of pilgrimage.

208
00:17:23,388 --> 00:17:27,593
"If there is to be hope,
we must all betray our countries."

209
00:17:27,715 --> 00:17:29,950
Ah, Dante, old chum.

210
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,598
Come to pay your respects
to old Boris, have you?

211
00:17:32,725 --> 00:17:34,684
Boris Pasternak.

212
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:38,207
Do you think he knows
people are allowed to read him again?

213
00:17:38,335 --> 00:17:42,621
"All victims are equal.
None is more equal than others."

214
00:17:42,743 --> 00:17:45,586
Yes, well... some write better than others.

215
00:17:45,509 --> 00:17:50,466
"How sweet it is to hate one's native land,
to desire its ruin,

216
00:17:50,598 --> 00:17:56,719
and in its ruin to discern
the dawn of universal rebirth."

217
00:17:57,171 --> 00:18:01,091
- Pasternak?
- No. Pecherin. An earlier poet.

218
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:07,497
Pecherin understood that it's possible to
love your country while hating its system.

219
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:09,590
If you say so.

220
00:18:11,036 --> 00:18:12,996
I love my country.

221
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,797
I love it too - your country.

222
00:18:17,327 --> 00:18:19,641
And I'm reasonably fond of my own.

223
00:18:19,771 --> 00:18:24,457
To save it, perhaps
it's necessary to betray it. Yes?

224
00:18:24,581 --> 00:18:27,180
Because you and I, we love truth.

225
00:18:30,912 --> 00:18:32,871
Who are you, Dante?

226
00:18:33,477 --> 00:18:35,789
What do you do for a living?

227
00:18:37,885 --> 00:18:39,878
I am a moral outcast.

228
00:18:40,009 --> 00:18:42,608
Oh, it's always nice to meet a writer.

229
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:46,213
And what sort of rubbish
are you turning out now?

230
00:18:46,341 --> 00:18:48,300
Lies.

231
00:18:48,865 --> 00:18:50,825
I am the lie.

232
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:54,508
Really?

233
00:18:58,843 --> 00:19:00,883
You spoke the truth.

234
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:06,808
Promise me that you are not a spy, and
then I will make you a promise in return.

235
00:19:07,459 --> 00:19:10,855
I'm not a spy, actually. Not my line.

236
00:19:11,547 --> 00:19:14,545
You are nobody's spy? Not even ours?

237
00:19:16,596 --> 00:19:20,391
Dante, I'm getting a bit jumpy,
to be honest.

238
00:19:20,884 --> 00:19:23,082
I'm nobody's spy.

239
00:19:25,772 --> 00:19:28,949
Let's talk about something else.
How about chess?

240
00:19:28,979 --> 00:19:33,823
Oh, chess. In chess there are no lies.
But in my game lies are everything.

241
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:37,225
What game is that?

242
00:19:37,354 --> 00:19:40,670
The Soviet knight is dying
inside his armour.

243
00:19:40,801 --> 00:19:42,715
You are in danger only from our lies.

244
00:19:42,845 --> 00:19:45,922
I commit the lie every day.
I lie even to my masters.

245
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:51,418
So, promise me that if I ever find
the courage to think like a hero,

246
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:55,746
then you will act like
a merely decent human being. Right?

247
00:19:57,031 --> 00:20:00,746
- Dante, leave me out, will you?
- Hey, you cannot reject me.

248
00:20:00,878 --> 00:20:03,157
Because I am strengthened
by your rejection.

249
00:20:03,282 --> 00:20:05,436
So, promise me.

250
00:20:06,086 --> 00:20:09,323
What the hell am I promising,
for God's sake?

251
00:20:10,415 --> 00:20:12,375
Promise.

252
00:20:13,621 --> 00:20:15,661
All right.

253
00:20:17,388 --> 00:20:19,747
If you ever manage to be a hero,

254
00:20:20,794 --> 00:20:23,996
I'll be a... decent human being.

255
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,277
OK?

256
00:20:25,402 --> 00:20:26,917
Promise?

257
00:20:27,045 --> 00:20:29,005
I promise.

258
00:20:31,253 --> 00:20:35,493
Why didn't you come to us?! I know why.
You put your head in the sand.

259
00:20:35,621 --> 00:20:38,185
Don't know because don't want to know.

260
00:20:39,668 --> 00:20:42,984
I'm sorry, but we're going to need
your rather serious help.

261
00:20:49,006 --> 00:20:52,801
Then I asked him "What am I supposed
to be promising, for God's sake?"

262
00:20:52,932 --> 00:20:56,534
Why didn't you come to us?! I know why.
You put your head in the sand.

263
00:20:56,659 --> 00:20:58,973
Don't know because don't want to know.

264
00:20:59,104 --> 00:21:02,865
- Who the hell is that?
- Walter? He's a character.

265
00:21:02,992 --> 00:21:06,752
I'm sorry, but we're going to need
your rather serious help.

266
00:21:06,878 --> 00:21:09,795
- That's it.
- And the notebooks?

267
00:21:09,924 --> 00:21:13,126
The notebooks don't mesh
with any disinformation artist,

268
00:21:13,249 --> 00:21:16,054
con man or intelligence peddler we know.

269
00:21:16,176 --> 00:21:19,491
Our psychology and handwriting gurus
tried to fault them.

270
00:21:19,622 --> 00:21:22,984
- And?
- They failed.

271
00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:25,668
Try harder, Russell.

272
00:21:27,075 --> 00:21:28,636
No.

273
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:31,081
No.

274
00:21:32,084 --> 00:21:33,521
No.

275
00:21:33,648 --> 00:21:35,687
Not even a perhaps or a maybe?

276
00:21:35,811 --> 00:21:40,530
No. Not even a tickle, old boy.
They're not in Dante's class.

277
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,180
All right.

278
00:21:50,078 --> 00:21:51,753
Is that Katya?

279
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,878
- That's her.
- You remember her now?

280
00:22:01,218 --> 00:22:03,177
No such luck.

281
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,631
Choose someone else.

282
00:22:31,754 --> 00:22:34,398
We didn't choose you. Dante did.

283
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:37,841
Because I wasn't a spy.

284
00:22:37,965 --> 00:22:41,407
We're not asking you to build
the beastly rockets or push the button.

285
00:22:41,532 --> 00:22:43,970
Only to help improve
our knowledge of the enemy.

286
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:47,698
And if the enemy turns out to be a friend,
where's the harm?

287
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:51,186
I thought we were all supposed
to be chums together now.

288
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:53,144
Oh, my dear Lord!

289
00:22:53,274 --> 00:22:56,989
Because this year it suits them
to roll over and play nice doggie?

290
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,162
Because this year they're
on the floor anyway? You ninny.

291
00:23:00,285 --> 00:23:02,805
All the more reason to spy
the daylights out of 'em.

292
00:23:02,931 --> 00:23:06,407
Kick 'em in the balls
every time they get to their knees.

293
00:23:06,537 --> 00:23:08,772
Well, that's where I disagree.

294
00:23:09,182 --> 00:23:12,225
I'll back my Russia against yours
any time.

295
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,462
Nah.

296
00:23:14,591 --> 00:23:17,030
I'm sorry, Ned. No go.

297
00:23:48,775 --> 00:23:51,818
Bloody woman. I must've given offence.

298
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:56,305
She has a point.

299
00:23:56,589 --> 00:23:58,823
Worry about Dante.

300
00:23:58,954 --> 00:24:00,708
He reached out for you.

301
00:24:00,837 --> 00:24:03,149
Would you rather
throw him to the Americans?

302
00:24:03,281 --> 00:24:05,595
Don't be fooled by Bob's Yaley manner.

303
00:24:05,726 --> 00:24:09,168
The Yanks will take Dante,
put him on a spit and have a barbecue.

304
00:24:09,293 --> 00:24:11,527
How will you live with yourself?

305
00:24:11,656 --> 00:24:13,856
I don't live with myself.

306
00:24:14,381 --> 00:24:16,820
In fact, I try to give myself a wide berth.

307
00:24:16,946 --> 00:24:20,502
I'm offering you a fresh start.
And a fat cheque.

308
00:24:21,395 --> 00:24:23,913
Never mind the money.
Barley's far too grand.

309
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,193
This is something people write in for.

310
00:24:26,324 --> 00:24:29,879
The chance to be an active player
in the defence of their country.

311
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,973
You live in a free society.
You've no choice.

312
00:24:33,095 --> 00:24:37,177
Any decent church would've
burnt you bastards years ago.

313
00:24:41,632 --> 00:24:43,911
You're a fool to use me.

314
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,600
I let people down.

315
00:25:00,466 --> 00:25:02,107
Abercrombie and Blair.

316
00:25:02,229 --> 00:25:07,359
Is it the office of...
Mr Bartholomew Scott Blair?

317
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,360
Yes. But he isn't in at the moment.

318
00:25:09,483 --> 00:25:11,876
Can I help, or would you
like to leave a message?

319
00:25:12,007 --> 00:25:14,925
No, thank you. It is a publishing matter.

320
00:25:15,053 --> 00:25:17,525
I will telephone again. Thank you.

321
00:25:21,104 --> 00:25:23,987
Crowds are good,
if you keep moving.

322
00:25:28,116 --> 00:25:30,395
Open spaces are good.

323
00:25:33,165 --> 00:25:36,243
Talking in the street is OK, if you have to.

324
00:25:36,372 --> 00:25:39,130
Never, never talk in a car
or in your hotel room,

325
00:25:39,258 --> 00:25:42,140
except for the benefit
of their microphones.

326
00:25:42,263 --> 00:25:47,905
If you've read anything about playing
the radio or running the taps, forget it.

327
00:25:48,033 --> 00:25:50,791
That's right. The source
is the star of the show.

328
00:25:50,918 --> 00:25:54,839
And the star decides
whether to make the meeting or abort.

329
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:58,643
This is fun. Is that why you keep it secret?

330
00:26:00,496 --> 00:26:02,775
Did you spot our watchers?

331
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:07,058
The tramp raiding the dustbin,
the woman with the white shoes,

332
00:26:07,188 --> 00:26:10,027
and, of course, the man with the tracksuit.

333
00:26:10,154 --> 00:26:13,231
You scored nil. Out of a possible 12.

334
00:26:14,482 --> 00:26:17,638
The lesson is
you'll never know who they are.

335
00:26:18,769 --> 00:26:24,252
If you need to write something down, use
a single sheet of paper on a hard surface.

336
00:26:24,741 --> 00:26:27,054
That leaves no impression.

337
00:26:28,187 --> 00:26:31,424
How many such surfaces
can you see in this room?

338
00:26:32,554 --> 00:26:35,438
Well, including the windowsill... four.

339
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,601
Seven.

340
00:26:37,723 --> 00:26:39,924
This is often easiest.

341
00:26:41,732 --> 00:26:44,534
Then wipe it clean - rubbing hard.

342
00:26:45,498 --> 00:26:47,493
The issue is why.

343
00:26:48,063 --> 00:26:50,946
That's what you're looking for all the time.

344
00:26:51,069 --> 00:26:53,793
If we trust the motive, we trust the man.

345
00:26:53,914 --> 00:26:56,069
Then we can trust the material.

346
00:26:56,519 --> 00:26:58,832
Why did Dante pick on Katya?

347
00:26:59,244 --> 00:27:01,682
Why does he put her life at risk?

348
00:27:01,808 --> 00:27:03,848
Why does she let him?

349
00:27:04,493 --> 00:27:06,134
Is she a spy?

350
00:27:06,256 --> 00:27:10,497
- It's voice-activated, sir. You switch...
- I know all this. I've had it up to here.

351
00:27:10,624 --> 00:27:13,098
I just want to get it done.
What's the hold-up?

352
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:18,754
It's everything we ever wanted to know
about Russia and were afraid to ask.

353
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,276
- Sounds like the pot of gold.
- Sounds like a crock of shit.

354
00:27:22,485 --> 00:27:26,203
Some unidentified walk-in is telling us
the Russians are way behind,

355
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:29,331
they can't hurt us,
we can pull in our horns.

356
00:27:29,459 --> 00:27:32,935
Who the hell is gonna
sell that story on the Hill?

357
00:27:33,747 --> 00:27:35,627
Russell?

358
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:38,793
It could turn around
and bite us right in the ass.

359
00:27:38,916 --> 00:27:40,956
Let the Brits run with it for a while.

360
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:45,127
Dante is their source,
and, uh... Scott Blair is their problem.

361
00:27:45,248 --> 00:27:48,849
I'll go with that, Russell. But I want
Joe and Larry with him in London.

362
00:27:48,974 --> 00:27:50,809
Friendly observers, OK?

363
00:27:52,461 --> 00:27:54,660
You'll do us proud, Barley.

364
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:59,350
I've brought you a present.

365
00:28:00,556 --> 00:28:03,154
It's not to keep. It's just to sniff.

366
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:12,446
- Am I supposed to offer to publish it?
- Offer him anything he wants.

367
00:28:12,579 --> 00:28:15,575
Say anything you need to say
to keep him with us.

368
00:28:15,704 --> 00:28:17,902
Except the truth?

369
00:28:20,993 --> 00:28:23,227
Bon voyage, Barley.

370
00:28:23,958 --> 00:28:27,846
Come back with the goods on Dante,
starting with his real name,

371
00:28:27,967 --> 00:28:30,963
and I'll get you a knighthood for literature.

372
00:28:34,218 --> 00:28:36,257
The Russia House.

373
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:56,047
Barley Scott Blair.
Abercrombie and Blair?

374
00:28:56,417 --> 00:28:58,572
London. The publishers.

375
00:28:59,224 --> 00:29:01,422
I believe you know Niki Landau.

376
00:29:01,548 --> 00:29:02,539
Yes.

377
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:06,829
Well, Niki was very insistent that I should
give you a call. How do you do?

378
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,874
How do you do?

379
00:29:10,003 --> 00:29:12,760
I'll tell you why I'm calling.
I'm here in Moscow.

380
00:29:12,888 --> 00:29:16,809
And Niki's sent you about a ton of tea.
Well, a couple of pounds.

381
00:29:16,936 --> 00:29:18,895
I hope you like tea.

382
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:22,736
I was wondering
if we could arrange a handover.

383
00:29:22,867 --> 00:29:25,545
- A handover?
- Do you ever escape for lunch?

384
00:29:25,671 --> 00:29:27,825
Yes. Of course.

385
00:29:27,955 --> 00:29:31,113
Well, how about today?
I'm at the Ukraine Hotel.

386
00:29:31,443 --> 00:29:34,884
- That would be convenient.
- Good. Marvellous.

387
00:29:35,009 --> 00:29:37,243
Well, I'll be outside from 12.30 on.

388
00:29:37,373 --> 00:29:40,689
- How will I know you?
- Oh, listen, I'm easy to recognise.

389
00:29:40,819 --> 00:29:44,866
I look like a large, unmade bed
with a shopping bag attached.

390
00:29:52,762 --> 00:29:53,798
We're off.

391
00:30:17,447 --> 00:30:19,406
Hi. Hello.

392
00:30:20,613 --> 00:30:22,367
You're Katya, of course.

393
00:30:22,496 --> 00:30:25,493
Yes. And you must be Mr Barley.

394
00:30:25,621 --> 00:30:28,663
Yes, indeed. The same. Well done.

395
00:30:29,749 --> 00:30:32,393
Well, er... where shall we go?

396
00:30:32,514 --> 00:30:35,478
I brought your stuff from Niki,
but I'll carry it.

397
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,243
How did you recognise me, Mr Barley?

398
00:30:39,407 --> 00:30:43,612
Well, Niki said you were Russia's answer
to the Venus de Milo.

399
00:30:44,496 --> 00:30:46,536
That is ridiculous.

400
00:31:01,567 --> 00:31:04,485
I was nearly arrested here
three years ago.

401
00:31:05,094 --> 00:31:07,772
They said I was photographing
a military subject.

402
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:11,375
- And were you?
- No. A soldier and his girlfriend.

403
00:31:11,506 --> 00:31:13,818
They asked me to take their picture.

404
00:31:24,329 --> 00:31:27,053
Obviously I received the manuscript.

405
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:32,418
I will take you to where
we can have lunch.

406
00:31:32,545 --> 00:31:35,063
If you do not mind, I will first buy shoes.

407
00:31:35,189 --> 00:31:37,263
Shoes?

408
00:31:37,834 --> 00:31:40,032
Today there is a shipment of shoes.

409
00:31:40,158 --> 00:31:43,919
With perestroika, there is
even less available than before.

410
00:31:44,245 --> 00:31:48,452
- Really? I thought things were improving.
- Everything is corrupt and incompetent.

411
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:51,811
Perhaps different people
are now stealing. I don't know.

412
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,740
Keep your voice down.

413
00:31:53,863 --> 00:31:56,062
Complaining is our new human right.

414
00:31:56,187 --> 00:31:59,550
Glasnost gives everyone
the right to complain and accuse,

415
00:31:59,674 --> 00:32:01,953
but it doesn't make more shoes.

416
00:32:20,713 --> 00:32:23,710
Tell me about your new Russian book.

417
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,354
Oh, yes. The book.

418
00:32:27,244 --> 00:32:31,529
Well, my problem is that, er,
I don't know the author's real name,

419
00:32:31,652 --> 00:32:34,731
let alone where he gets
all his information from.

420
00:32:34,859 --> 00:32:37,697
Learned his craft and so forth. Hm?

421
00:32:38,345 --> 00:32:40,783
Such personal questions
are not appropriate.

422
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:43,667
Some writers can only work in obscurity.

423
00:32:44,235 --> 00:32:46,355
But you know publishing, hm?

424
00:32:46,479 --> 00:32:50,720
If a fella's written about
the hill tribes of northern Burma,

425
00:32:50,848 --> 00:32:54,768
well, you're entitled to know if he's
ever been further south than Minsk.

426
00:32:54,895 --> 00:32:59,020
Especially if it's a really important book.
Which this one is.

427
00:32:59,663 --> 00:33:01,784
Dynamite, in fact.

428
00:33:02,509 --> 00:33:05,905
The author was inspired by certain
opinions of a British publisher

429
00:33:06,036 --> 00:33:08,315
concerning world peace.

430
00:33:09,121 --> 00:33:12,278
Do you think he'd like
to meet that publisher again?

431
00:33:13,088 --> 00:33:16,005
It is not known. This can be established.

432
00:33:16,134 --> 00:33:18,972
The publisher would like
to meet him again.

433
00:33:21,544 --> 00:33:24,347
How long are you staying in Moscow,
please, Mr Barley?

434
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:27,352
Seven days... Mrs Katya.

435
00:33:53,964 --> 00:33:56,401
- Where do you live?
- With my children.

436
00:33:56,528 --> 00:33:58,967
Your children? How many?

437
00:33:59,092 --> 00:34:02,888
I have a boy and a girl.
They are eight and nine years old.

438
00:34:03,019 --> 00:34:04,979
It is not relevant.

439
00:34:05,904 --> 00:34:08,139
What does your husband do?

440
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:10,505
It is not important.

441
00:34:10,633 --> 00:34:13,027
- Is he a publisher too?
- No.

442
00:34:13,158 --> 00:34:15,039
Is he a writer?

443
00:34:15,162 --> 00:34:16,198
No.

444
00:34:16,324 --> 00:34:18,522
A composer? A cook?

445
00:34:19,129 --> 00:34:21,728
Is he a dressmaker in Vladivostok?

446
00:34:22,335 --> 00:34:26,176
His factory prefabricates houses
for rural areas.

447
00:34:28,306 --> 00:34:32,192
We are divorced.
Like everybody else in Moscow.

448
00:34:39,607 --> 00:34:42,889
Unfortunately, I have
to return to my children now.

449
00:34:43,013 --> 00:34:45,087
Isn't someone looking after them?

450
00:34:45,217 --> 00:34:48,180
Well, ring up. Tell them
you've met a fascinating man

451
00:34:48,303 --> 00:34:51,140
that wants to talk literature
to you all day.

452
00:34:51,268 --> 00:34:53,023
I'm sorry. I cannot.

453
00:34:53,151 --> 00:34:55,466
Oh, look, we've hardly met.

454
00:35:02,648 --> 00:35:04,164
I need time.

455
00:35:04,291 --> 00:35:08,178
I've got 10,000 enormously
serious things to discuss

456
00:35:08,299 --> 00:35:10,499
with a beautiful Russian woman.

457
00:35:11,104 --> 00:35:14,386
I don't bite, I don't lie...
Have dinner with me.

458
00:35:15,272 --> 00:35:18,908
- At least show me something of Moscow.
- It is not convenient.

459
00:35:19,038 --> 00:35:21,682
- Then give me your home number.
- It is not convenient.

460
00:35:21,803 --> 00:35:23,763
- Will you call me, then?
- Perhaps.

461
00:35:23,887 --> 00:35:24,845
When?

462
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:27,249
Perhaps I shall call you late tonight.

463
00:35:27,374 --> 00:35:29,254
No, not "perhaps".

464
00:35:29,378 --> 00:35:31,337
I shall call you.

465
00:35:43,404 --> 00:35:45,683
You forgot to give her the tea.

466
00:35:56,348 --> 00:35:58,707
- Mr Blair, sir?
- Wicklow.

467
00:35:59,914 --> 00:36:03,151
Excellent morning's work, sir.
No problems.

468
00:36:05,043 --> 00:36:10,764
Oh, by the way, you asked why so many
Russians use the word "convenient".

469
00:36:11,416 --> 00:36:15,575
In Russian it's "udobno".
But it also means "proper".

470
00:36:17,185 --> 00:36:20,308
- A bit confusing really.
- Yes, it is indeed.

471
00:36:34,738 --> 00:36:36,412
We have an interim, sir.

472
00:36:36,541 --> 00:36:41,624
Katya left her office, took a taxi,
unknown destination. We have it covered.

473
00:36:53,371 --> 00:36:55,012
Da?

474
00:36:55,134 --> 00:36:56,650
Da, eta Alina.

475
00:36:58,822 --> 00:37:00,896
- Dobry dyen.
- Barley!

476
00:37:01,026 --> 00:37:03,339
- Welcome to Moscow, my dear chap!
- Alik.

477
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:07,949
Why do you look so healthy? Why
have you no hangover? Are you in love?

478
00:37:08,479 --> 00:37:10,154
How did you know, Alik?

479
00:37:10,282 --> 00:37:14,044
Meet Leonard Carl Wicklow,
our new editor of Soviet books.

480
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:16,734
Alik Zapadny of VAAP,

481
00:37:16,855 --> 00:37:20,457
the all-suffocating
Soviet Copyright Agency.

482
00:37:21,263 --> 00:37:26,106
- How is Barley paying you, Mr Wicklow?
- Oh, Russia's top of the pops these days.

483
00:37:26,232 --> 00:37:29,435
Mention to the money boys
that we want to build up a Russian list

484
00:37:29,558 --> 00:37:31,438
and they throw money at us.

485
00:37:31,562 --> 00:37:36,121
Have you a sales force, or are you
still relying on divine intervention?

486
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:38,484
And how about translators?

487
00:37:38,614 --> 00:37:43,539
On fiction we will use our own
and take another 5% royalty. How's that?

488
00:37:44,946 --> 00:37:47,784
- We'll consider it.
- No, I don't think so.

489
00:37:48,353 --> 00:37:50,472
We don't have the margin.

490
00:37:50,596 --> 00:37:52,556
Exactly.

491
00:37:53,041 --> 00:37:55,001
Well done, Wickers.

492
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:59,770
- Jesus, Barley!
- Yuri.

493
00:37:59,894 --> 00:38:03,050
What are you doing here?
You're a month early for the book fair.

494
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:07,339
Yuri, I want you to meet Len Wicklow,
our new Russian-speaking specialist.

495
00:38:07,467 --> 00:38:09,427
Hello. You a spy?

496
00:38:09,551 --> 00:38:12,548
- Only in my spare time, sir.
- Jesus, I like him.

497
00:38:12,676 --> 00:38:14,991
Oh, thank you. Sit down, friend.

498
00:38:16,484 --> 00:38:18,604
Let's deal direct, OK?

499
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:22,533
To hell with those assholes at VAAP.

500
00:38:23,817 --> 00:38:26,859
Stay away from them.
Especially Zapadny.

501
00:38:27,303 --> 00:38:29,104
I don't say he's KGB.

502
00:38:29,227 --> 00:38:33,148
All I say is he needed some damned good
friends to get him back into circulation.

503
00:38:33,274 --> 00:38:35,110
Know what I mean?

504
00:38:35,238 --> 00:38:37,312
- Cheers.
- Na zdorovye.

505
00:38:37,923 --> 00:38:41,000
Oh, Barley... I have something for you.

506
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:46,450
Some of these writers haven't yet
been to jail. But I'm working on it.

507
00:38:46,579 --> 00:38:51,263
I'll make them famous in the West
even if it kills them.

508
00:38:57,519 --> 00:38:58,476
It's me.

509
00:38:59,042 --> 00:39:00,602
Do I disturb you?

510
00:39:01,166 --> 00:39:03,526
Deeply. Come over.

511
00:39:06,696 --> 00:39:10,902
You invited me to show you Moscow
tomorrow, I think.

512
00:39:11,745 --> 00:39:15,107
I did. Where do I send the glass coach?

513
00:39:16,152 --> 00:39:20,154
I have the tapes, and I've never heard
such pussyfooting around in my life!

514
00:39:20,281 --> 00:39:23,757
Barley has gotta tell Katya:
no more Greta fucking Garbo.

515
00:39:23,888 --> 00:39:26,167
And Dante better shit or get off the pot.

516
00:39:26,291 --> 00:39:28,685
I'm being pelted with crap
in the streets here!

517
00:39:28,816 --> 00:39:31,540
All right, Russell, message understood.

518
00:39:31,862 --> 00:39:33,378
Brock?

519
00:39:33,505 --> 00:39:36,548
Russell's metaphors are becoming
rather scatological.

520
00:39:36,671 --> 00:39:39,428
Signal Paddy at the embassy.
I want him to talk to Barley.

521
00:39:57,308 --> 00:39:59,268
Er, we're this way.

522
00:40:19,029 --> 00:40:21,227
I hope you like churches.

523
00:40:21,353 --> 00:40:24,795
In Russia we don't ask that.
It is not convenient.

524
00:40:24,919 --> 00:40:27,961
Ah. I think you mean "proper". No?

525
00:40:28,084 --> 00:40:30,044
- Proper?
- Mm.

526
00:40:30,408 --> 00:40:32,642
Nyet. Convenient.

527
00:40:42,391 --> 00:40:46,516
Now you know why hardly anyone
comes up here. Mind your head.

528
00:40:49,244 --> 00:40:51,283
One more to go. This way.

529
00:41:00,704 --> 00:41:02,824
This is just like school.

530
00:41:02,948 --> 00:41:06,105
Dear old, bloody old... school.

531
00:41:12,446 --> 00:41:14,759
Who is that man down there?

532
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:17,328
Oh, he's my editor. He's keeping lookout.

533
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:20,891
Are we ready? Thank you, Brock.

534
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:28,074
Why is an editor keeping a lookout?

535
00:41:28,195 --> 00:41:29,950
Well...

536
00:41:34,647 --> 00:41:36,482
Do you drink this stuff?

537
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:38,205
No.

538
00:41:39,335 --> 00:41:41,295
Me neither.

539
00:41:44,865 --> 00:41:47,543
What's Dante's real name, huh?

540
00:41:49,593 --> 00:41:51,554
Who is he?

541
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,960
Does he test things?

542
00:41:55,566 --> 00:41:58,643
Is he a physicist?
An engineer? Is he army?

543
00:42:00,975 --> 00:42:02,855
Does he like ice cream?

544
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:05,018
Does he like the movies?

545
00:42:05,623 --> 00:42:09,066
Is he one man? Is he two? Is he a group?

546
00:42:11,835 --> 00:42:15,072
Why don't you just start talking
and let's see how it goes?

547
00:42:15,201 --> 00:42:18,563
Come on, Katya. You started this, I didn't.

548
00:42:19,809 --> 00:42:24,973
Come on, it's me, Barley Blair.
I do jokes, I do bird noises, I drink.

549
00:42:26,342 --> 00:42:28,301
I'm a friend.

550
00:42:29,307 --> 00:42:33,023
- Who is he?
- I don't know what I may tell you.

551
00:42:34,997 --> 00:42:37,311
What did he tell you to tell me?

552
00:42:38,524 --> 00:42:41,202
Whatever is necessary.
That I should trust you.

553
00:42:41,329 --> 00:42:44,087
He was generous. It is his nature.

554
00:42:44,815 --> 00:42:48,292
Why did you send me the book
if you didn't trust me?

555
00:42:48,903 --> 00:42:52,949
It was for him that I sent it.
I did not select you, he did.

556
00:42:54,713 --> 00:42:56,069
Oh.

557
00:42:58,921 --> 00:43:01,486
He is... my friend.

558
00:43:02,727 --> 00:43:05,247
Is this what you usually do for friends?

559
00:43:05,372 --> 00:43:08,017
Smuggle their manuscripts
out to the West?

560
00:43:08,138 --> 00:43:10,418
Risk your life, your children?

561
00:43:11,424 --> 00:43:14,547
Does he understand the consequences?
Does he care?

562
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:16,585
He is reconciled.

563
00:43:16,714 --> 00:43:19,278
- Are you?
- Of course.

564
00:43:19,398 --> 00:43:21,358
And your children?

565
00:43:22,604 --> 00:43:25,123
It is for them and their generation.

566
00:43:27,013 --> 00:43:29,737
He is inspired by the new openness here.

567
00:43:29,858 --> 00:43:32,935
But he knows that nothing
will change by itself.

568
00:43:33,744 --> 00:43:35,659
- And you agree?
- Yes! And so do you!

569
00:43:35,788 --> 00:43:38,991
You spoke for him.
It is for you we are here!

570
00:43:42,761 --> 00:43:44,915
That's worth a drink.

571
00:43:55,425 --> 00:44:00,427
He is not a soldier.
He is a scientist. He is a physicist.

572
00:44:00,754 --> 00:44:04,230
- Also qualified in aspects of engineering.
- Better! Ha-ha!

573
00:44:04,361 --> 00:44:07,038
Engineering.
We're making progress, gentlemen.

574
00:44:08,047 --> 00:44:10,043
Where was he trained?

575
00:44:10,172 --> 00:44:11,893
He went to the LITMO.

576
00:44:12,015 --> 00:44:15,138
Afterwards to postgraduate studies
at the university.

577
00:44:15,261 --> 00:44:16,298
What's the LITMO?

578
00:44:16,704 --> 00:44:21,024
Leningrad Institute of Mechanical and
Optical Science! Write that down, fellas.

579
00:44:21,272 --> 00:44:25,271
LITMO is the Leningrad Institute
for Mechanical and Optical Science.

580
00:44:25,399 --> 00:44:30,278
He was extremely brilliant.
At 14 he won a mathematics olympiad.

581
00:44:30,409 --> 00:44:32,369
Mathematics.

582
00:44:33,174 --> 00:44:37,173
When I was at school,
they were the people I couldn't stand.

583
00:44:39,264 --> 00:44:43,585
Naturally, if you are not so intelligent,
you will be jealous.

584
00:44:57,619 --> 00:45:00,856
From university he went
to Academgorodok,

585
00:45:00,985 --> 00:45:03,549
the City of Science at Novosibirsk.

586
00:45:03,669 --> 00:45:07,032
He was... like a meteor there.

587
00:45:07,156 --> 00:45:09,195
Is that where you met him?

588
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,115
No!

589
00:45:11,243 --> 00:45:15,210
In Leningrad. I was a child.
A great intellectual of 16.

590
00:45:15,331 --> 00:45:17,895
- I met Yakov at the club...
- Yakov?

591
00:45:18,897 --> 00:45:21,370
- Yakov is Dante?
- Yes. Yakov.

592
00:45:21,622 --> 00:45:24,665
- First name Yakov!
- Jacky.

593
00:45:24,908 --> 00:45:27,826
We met at the Club of Scientists.

594
00:45:27,955 --> 00:45:31,236
It was at a closed showing
of a foreign film.

595
00:45:31,361 --> 00:45:34,723
It was by Godard.
?bout de souffle. Breathless.

596
00:45:34,846 --> 00:45:37,001
I went with my father.

597
00:45:40,176 --> 00:45:42,536
And what year are we talking about now?

598
00:45:42,661 --> 00:45:44,256
1968.

599
00:45:44,384 --> 00:45:46,663
You remember '68?

600
00:45:46,789 --> 00:45:50,504
The Paris students at the barricades,
American students against Vietnam,

601
00:45:50,635 --> 00:45:53,633
and for us it was Czechoslovakia.

602
00:45:58,169 --> 00:46:01,885
Yakov said that the Russians
would never stop

603
00:46:02,017 --> 00:46:04,775
the extraordinary reforms
happening there.

604
00:46:04,902 --> 00:46:07,214
It was the start of a new age.

605
00:46:07,867 --> 00:46:10,431
He had come back to Leningrad
to be a part of it.

606
00:46:10,552 --> 00:46:12,672
- From where?
- From the military.

607
00:46:13,237 --> 00:46:17,842
They had seduced him with privileges,
money for his researches...

608
00:46:18,407 --> 00:46:19,923
They had corrupted him.

609
00:46:20,049 --> 00:46:25,577
He had come back to Leningrad
to recover his innocence.

610
00:46:26,621 --> 00:46:28,580
He was beautiful.

611
00:46:28,705 --> 00:46:30,985
Not like a scientist, like an...

612
00:46:32,272 --> 00:46:34,232
artist.

613
00:46:36,519 --> 00:46:38,798
So you fell in love with him.

614
00:46:41,248 --> 00:46:43,720
He was my first lover.

615
00:47:00,724 --> 00:47:04,167
It was the same night
that the tanks entered Prague.

616
00:47:07,016 --> 00:47:09,659
There was no more innocence anywhere.

617
00:47:11,062 --> 00:47:14,060
Yakov said that innocence
was a delusion.

618
00:47:14,188 --> 00:47:17,710
And a few weeks later
he returned to the military.

619
00:47:19,038 --> 00:47:21,921
I did not talk to him for many years.

620
00:47:22,043 --> 00:47:28,894
Until last year, when he met a British
publisher who spoke to his heart.

621
00:47:30,738 --> 00:47:33,099
Next day, Yakov telephoned me
at the office.

622
00:47:33,224 --> 00:47:38,181
He had decided what he must do.
He needed my help.

623
00:47:38,994 --> 00:47:42,835
Is he alone in this?
Does he need anyone else's help?

624
00:47:43,401 --> 00:47:44,963
No.

625
00:47:45,085 --> 00:47:48,003
- None of his drinking friends?
- No.

626
00:47:48,732 --> 00:47:50,966
How can you be so certain?

627
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:57,458
Because I am certain that
in his thoughts he is completely alone.

628
00:48:00,553 --> 00:48:02,674
Are you happy with him?

629
00:48:03,399 --> 00:48:06,715
- Please?
- I mean, er... do you like him?

630
00:48:06,845 --> 00:48:10,970
As well as loving him.
Does he make you laugh? Hm?

631
00:48:12,094 --> 00:48:14,978
I believe that Yakov
is a great and important man,

632
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:21,506
who is trying to restore himself
and cannot survive without me.

633
00:48:24,678 --> 00:48:25,714
Oh.

634
00:48:27,964 --> 00:48:30,927
Jesus Christ, Mother of God! It's Savelyev!

635
00:48:32,291 --> 00:48:35,255
Yakov Yefremovich Savelyev!

636
00:48:37,101 --> 00:48:41,306
Did he mention anything about, er...
falsification of results?

637
00:48:44,313 --> 00:48:50,275
He talks about "the great lie".
Everything is part of the great lie.

638
00:48:50,405 --> 00:48:52,046
Ah. Go on.

639
00:48:52,169 --> 00:48:54,892
Are you part of the great lie also, Barley?

640
00:48:55,013 --> 00:48:55,685
What?

641
00:48:55,815 --> 00:48:59,017
I think I am also allowed to ask questions.

642
00:48:59,862 --> 00:49:02,095
Oh, of course. Ask.

643
00:49:04,311 --> 00:49:06,748
Are you Mr Bartholomew Scott Blair?

644
00:49:06,875 --> 00:49:09,269
- Aw, for God's sake...
- Are you?

645
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:12,475
- Yes.
- Are you a publisher?

646
00:49:14,970 --> 00:49:16,530
Yes.

647
00:49:17,374 --> 00:49:19,369
Are you a spy?

648
00:49:21,222 --> 00:49:22,817
No.

649
00:49:24,187 --> 00:49:27,629
Are you alone in this,
or were you sent by others?

650
00:49:32,201 --> 00:49:34,161
Answer her.

651
00:49:38,893 --> 00:49:40,694
I'm alone.

652
00:49:41,057 --> 00:49:43,336
Jesus! Fuck.

653
00:49:44,223 --> 00:49:46,696
I'm alone, and that's the God's truth.

654
00:49:51,877 --> 00:49:54,032
Never been more alone.

655
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:09,186
Yakov said he will meet you in Leningrad
in four days from now.

656
00:50:09,309 --> 00:50:12,227
He has proposed three places
and three times.

657
00:50:12,355 --> 00:50:16,834
He will keep one of the appointments,
if he can.

658
00:50:19,087 --> 00:50:20,842
Good.

659
00:50:23,375 --> 00:50:25,974
Reconstruction. Openness.

660
00:50:26,421 --> 00:50:29,020
He's going to reconstruct
the balance of terror,

661
00:50:29,145 --> 00:50:32,507
and open the ultimate can of worms.

662
00:50:32,792 --> 00:50:37,272
Savelyev?! My God, if Dante is Savelyev,
you guys don't know what you've got!

663
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:39,795
Yes, we do. Trouble.

664
00:50:39,925 --> 00:50:42,888
Yakov Savelyev is
the right hand of God over there.

665
00:50:43,091 --> 00:50:47,217
And he says it's shit?
The Soviet threat's one big lie?

666
00:50:47,339 --> 00:50:48,774
And look at this.

667
00:50:48,901 --> 00:50:52,538
- They're bullshitting the Kremlin.
- Honour is due, Ned.

668
00:50:52,669 --> 00:50:55,347
Russell, I need your money.
And your love.

669
00:50:55,474 --> 00:50:59,189
I want an American partner for Barley.
I want him in Leningrad on Friday.

670
00:51:00,122 --> 00:51:02,766
I hear you, Ned. I'll get right back to you.

671
00:51:03,609 --> 00:51:08,293
If he says they can't hit Nevada on a clear
day, you better believe it. And be joyful.

672
00:51:08,417 --> 00:51:12,863
Joyful? Most of our customers
come to this town with contracts

673
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:17,590
to bring peace and prosperity to
the arms industry for the next 50 years.

674
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:20,115
But how the fuck
do you peddle an arms race

675
00:51:20,239 --> 00:51:23,396
when the only asshole you've got
to race against is yourself?

676
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,159
The night train to Leningrad.

677
00:51:44,284 --> 00:51:49,320
I may have mentioned Mr Potomac Books,
my new American partner?

678
00:51:49,453 --> 00:51:53,419
Well, he's doing Leningrad,
and he summoned me for a powwow.

679
00:51:53,901 --> 00:51:56,579
- Powwow?
- I thought you knew English.

680
00:51:57,268 --> 00:51:59,421
"Powwow" is not English.

681
00:52:00,072 --> 00:52:02,750
- You must sit down.
- Sit down? Why?

682
00:52:02,877 --> 00:52:06,479
It is our custom before a long journey
first to sit down.

683
00:52:07,285 --> 00:52:09,440
Well, I'm lying down. Won't that do?

684
00:52:11,092 --> 00:52:15,937
Well... you are supposed
to sit on your luggage

685
00:52:16,061 --> 00:52:18,739
and sigh a little and cross yourself.

686
00:52:22,353 --> 00:52:24,312
Hold everything.

687
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:33,291
OK.

688
00:52:35,857 --> 00:52:38,012
I was more comfortable lying down.

689
00:52:39,143 --> 00:52:41,343
Are you coming back to Moscow?

690
00:52:41,468 --> 00:52:44,385
No, not this time.
I have to fly straight back to school.

691
00:52:44,513 --> 00:52:46,074
School?

692
00:52:46,196 --> 00:52:49,433
Work. England.
It's a stupid expression of mine.

693
00:52:49,923 --> 00:52:51,997
I hope I didn't bore you last night.

694
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:54,361
You did not bore me.

695
00:52:54,491 --> 00:52:56,727
Oh. Perhaps next time.

696
00:52:58,219 --> 00:53:01,216
I'll make a special journey
just to talk about myself.

697
00:53:02,346 --> 00:53:04,545
I wish you a good journey, Barley.

698
00:53:05,752 --> 00:53:06,982
I'll miss you.

699
00:54:30,187 --> 00:54:34,346
I want you to know something, Scott.
This little country is on the move.

700
00:54:34,475 --> 00:54:36,230
I smell hope here.

701
00:54:36,358 --> 00:54:38,751
I smell change. I smell commerce.

702
00:54:40,565 --> 00:54:44,726
And we are buying ourselves a piece of it.
I'm proud. Proud.

703
00:54:49,383 --> 00:54:51,741
0800 hours. Barley and Wicklow
are in Leningrad.

704
00:54:51,867 --> 00:54:53,861
Checked in at the Pribaltiyskaya Hotel.

705
00:54:54,471 --> 00:54:56,706
Good. We're on schedule.

706
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:59,435
Barley's got three chances
to make contact.

707
00:54:59,561 --> 00:55:01,634
Now it's up to Dante.

708
00:55:47,729 --> 00:55:50,008
You want to sell me something?

709
00:55:51,336 --> 00:55:54,891
Cigarettes, Scotch, drugs, currency?

710
00:55:55,022 --> 00:55:57,096
No, thanks. Cheerio.

711
00:55:58,388 --> 00:56:00,268
You get lost?

712
00:56:00,392 --> 00:56:02,911
That's a good idea. Why don't you try it?

713
00:56:11,132 --> 00:56:12,613
One down, two to go.

714
00:56:31,128 --> 00:56:32,770
Where are you, Dante?

715
00:57:27,432 --> 00:57:31,033
Sir. Excuse me, sir,
but I think we are acquainted.

716
00:57:31,639 --> 00:57:35,481
Good God! The great Dante,
as I live and breathe!

717
00:57:36,248 --> 00:57:39,883
We met at that writer's party
at Peredelkino, remember?

718
00:57:40,015 --> 00:57:42,213
The only two sober people there.

719
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:45,414
- How are you?
- I'm very well.

720
00:57:46,466 --> 00:57:48,347
Welcome to Leningrad.

721
00:57:48,470 --> 00:57:51,627
You can walk a little?
It is safest to keep moving.

722
00:57:51,757 --> 00:57:53,955
Yes, they told me that.

723
00:57:57,206 --> 00:58:00,488
Barley's made contact! He's done it.

724
00:58:01,213 --> 00:58:03,333
Unfortunately, he couldn't find me.

725
00:58:03,457 --> 00:58:08,541
So he gave it to our authorities.
People of... discretion. Experts.

726
00:58:09,910 --> 00:58:11,950
You have betrayed me.

727
00:58:12,474 --> 00:58:14,433
Nobody's betrayed you.

728
00:58:15,038 --> 00:58:18,720
I told you. Your manuscript
went astray, that's all.

729
00:58:20,087 --> 00:58:22,482
Our authorities admire your book.

730
00:58:23,294 --> 00:58:25,607
But they need to know if it's true.

731
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:30,495
The best way would be
for you to talk with them.

732
00:58:30,668 --> 00:58:33,664
You came to tell me
you refuse to publish me?

733
00:58:33,793 --> 00:58:35,992
Dante, you're going too fast.

734
00:58:36,118 --> 00:58:38,032
Russia has no time.

735
00:58:38,162 --> 00:58:41,158
When the ice is thin,
you have to walk fast.

736
00:58:41,287 --> 00:58:43,521
To lose time is to lose everything.

737
00:58:43,652 --> 00:58:49,098
And then we all slide into the grave.
So be it. I will be the first corpse.

738
00:58:49,261 --> 00:58:51,575
And Katya second. What about her?

739
00:58:51,707 --> 00:58:53,666
She also chose.

740
00:58:54,711 --> 00:58:57,790
If we act together,
we will survive together.

741
00:58:58,398 --> 00:59:01,840
Have you forgotten
your words at Peredelkino?

742
00:59:04,168 --> 00:59:07,326
I am not the man you thought I was.

743
00:59:08,016 --> 00:59:12,302
You do not need to remind me that
man is not equal to his rhetoric.

744
00:59:12,424 --> 00:59:14,896
Our new people talk about openness.

745
00:59:16,391 --> 00:59:18,544
Disarmament. Peace.

746
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,481
Words.

747
00:59:24,406 --> 00:59:26,970
You like graveyards, Barley?

748
00:59:27,652 --> 00:59:30,615
Look. Here is ours if we fail.

749
00:59:32,381 --> 00:59:35,104
Chose a monument.

750
00:59:48,891 --> 00:59:52,332
Leave Katya out.
Go with the experts and leave her out.

751
00:59:52,456 --> 00:59:56,504
I shall wish a book jacket that is only
letters. No sensational drawings. Yes?

752
00:59:56,625 --> 00:59:59,064
Send the money to a deserving cause.

753
00:59:59,189 --> 01:00:01,913
- Dante...
- What is the matter? Are you afraid?

754
01:00:02,034 --> 01:00:04,313
Well, of course I'm bloody afraid!

755
01:00:06,042 --> 01:00:09,280
Here... the Revolution started.

756
01:00:10,050 --> 01:00:15,531
Imagine this place on that day when
the battleship Aurora fired that blank shot

757
01:00:15,659 --> 01:00:17,780
which signalled the Revolution.

758
01:00:19,106 --> 01:00:25,387
The next revolution shall begin with a few
gentle phrases of Johann Sebastian Bach.

759
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:32,162
Or maybe with some of the jazz
you play so beautifully.

760
01:00:33,812 --> 01:00:36,730
Yes, a little Sidney Bechet.

761
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:39,461
It's time.

762
01:00:49,161 --> 01:00:51,120
Da?

763
01:00:58,098 --> 01:01:00,741
Got a present for you.
They asked me to give it to you.

764
01:01:00,862 --> 01:01:03,745
It tells you how to get in touch with them.
I'll try to...

765
01:01:03,868 --> 01:01:07,344
Have you learned nothing?
They are against you, and against me.

766
01:01:07,474 --> 01:01:09,753
Those are not the decent people.

767
01:01:09,878 --> 01:01:14,005
How the hell do you know
who the decent people are any more?

768
01:01:14,127 --> 01:01:17,489
Come to England. Then you can
tell the world everything you want.

769
01:01:17,613 --> 01:01:20,211
You are wearing grey today, Barley.

770
01:01:22,021 --> 01:01:24,824
My father was sent to prison by grey men.

771
01:01:25,668 --> 01:01:30,352
He was murdered by men
who wore grey uniforms.

772
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:37,367
Grey men ruined my beautiful profession,
and take care, or they will ruin you too.

773
01:01:42,419 --> 01:01:44,299
Will you publish me?

774
01:01:44,422 --> 01:01:48,822
Or must I start again for my search
for a decent human being?

775
01:01:50,514 --> 01:01:52,313
No.

776
01:01:52,437 --> 01:01:54,396
I'm with you.

777
01:01:55,122 --> 01:01:57,321
I believe you're right.

778
01:02:05,501 --> 01:02:08,339
I dropped another notebook into your bag.

779
01:02:10,149 --> 01:02:12,463
Throw your friends a few bones.

780
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:17,519
Publish me.

781
01:02:54,550 --> 01:02:56,830
Barley. Welcome back.

782
01:02:56,955 --> 01:02:59,314
Nedski. Why aren't you working?

783
01:02:59,801 --> 01:03:03,482
I'm the red carpet.
And the bunting, and the brass band.

784
01:03:04,248 --> 01:03:06,447
Oh. You got the notebook.

785
01:03:07,174 --> 01:03:11,812
- Good stuff, was it?
- The best. You're the hero of the hour.

786
01:03:11,942 --> 01:03:13,902
You're a star.

787
01:03:14,387 --> 01:03:17,350
Where's Walter? Off with the boy scouts?

788
01:03:17,473 --> 01:03:21,189
Well, he's off the job, I'm afraid.
But he sends his love.

789
01:03:26,048 --> 01:03:28,806
The fourth notebook
is a deal-breaker.

790
01:03:29,655 --> 01:03:34,579
It's come-to-Jesus time for both sides
now, the hawks and the doves.

791
01:03:36,548 --> 01:03:39,943
The Agency has gotta
get off the fence, Russell.

792
01:04:20,027 --> 01:04:23,150
Only three weeks old,
and already a classic.

793
01:04:25,157 --> 01:04:28,120
Feel the weight of all the expert opinions.

794
01:04:30,405 --> 01:04:34,248
- Is there a conclusion?
- Clive, there is a conclusion.

795
01:04:35,335 --> 01:04:38,538
Drop it down the toilet,
and your guy with it.

796
01:04:43,269 --> 01:04:45,025
Ned?

797
01:04:50,163 --> 01:04:53,399
- Is that what you think, Russell?
- What I think?

798
01:04:53,529 --> 01:04:58,453
Well, expert opinion has it that
this notebook was written very quickly,

799
01:04:58,578 --> 01:05:02,624
or very slowly, by a man or a woman,
in anger or in jest.

800
01:05:02,745 --> 01:05:07,065
The writer was right- or left-handed.
He was a scientist and a non-scientist.

801
01:05:07,194 --> 01:05:09,153
What I think?

802
01:05:09,718 --> 01:05:12,601
For experts, there's no toilet deep enough.

803
01:05:15,008 --> 01:05:16,568
Good for you, Russell.

804
01:05:16,690 --> 01:05:20,817
The trouble is,
a lot of highly paid favourite sons

805
01:05:20,939 --> 01:05:24,176
are in danger of having their
rice bowls broken and going hungry,

806
01:05:24,304 --> 01:05:27,302
all on account
of these goddamn notebooks.

807
01:05:29,154 --> 01:05:33,838
The Russian military effort is stalled,
the American military effort is stalled.

808
01:05:33,963 --> 01:05:38,727
Their rocket motors suck instead of blow,
their ICBMs can't get out of their kennels,

809
01:05:38,852 --> 01:05:42,214
their scientists can't do
solid fuel for shit...

810
01:05:42,699 --> 01:05:45,423
Our customers don't like to hear that.

811
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:52,670
Jesus Christ. I have to come
all this way to tell you this?

812
01:05:56,765 --> 01:05:58,918
And yet here you are.

813
01:06:00,010 --> 01:06:02,084
And yet here I am.

814
01:06:03,015 --> 01:06:05,455
Clive, Ned, I'll tell you something.

815
01:06:05,861 --> 01:06:08,585
I am an honest-to-God glasnostic.

816
01:06:09,347 --> 01:06:14,146
I was born a glasnostic. My parents
are old glasnostics from way back.

817
01:06:15,038 --> 01:06:18,353
My children will be raised as glasnostics -
although I don't have any.

818
01:06:18,484 --> 01:06:23,727
And I really believe that Dante
is a source from glasnost heaven.

819
01:06:26,058 --> 01:06:29,899
I can't look away. He'll invade my sleep.

820
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:34,508
And for the rest of my fucking life
I'll be hearing him say

821
01:06:34,633 --> 01:06:39,033
"Russell, you had it in your hand.
Ned gave it to you."

822
01:06:43,009 --> 01:06:44,810
Honour is due, Ned.

823
01:06:50,544 --> 01:06:53,346
- You won't regret it, Russell.
- You might.

824
01:06:54,590 --> 01:06:56,585
We wanna meet your Mr Barley.

825
01:06:56,714 --> 01:07:00,235
In the back room,
with the lights in his eyes.

826
01:07:20,196 --> 01:07:24,117
Mr Blair,
you have all the attributes.

827
01:07:24,245 --> 01:07:27,368
Generosity, wit, courtesy,

828
01:07:28,092 --> 01:07:31,977
sang-froid, saxophone and reckless folly.

829
01:07:32,940 --> 01:07:37,100
So... what in the hell takes you
to Russia every five minutes?

830
01:07:37,990 --> 01:07:40,953
Are you, uh... buying property over there?

831
01:07:42,799 --> 01:07:44,234
That's a fair question.

832
01:07:44,361 --> 01:07:48,122
Fuck whether it's a fair question.
Just tell us the answer.

833
01:07:50,532 --> 01:07:52,493
I love the place.

834
01:07:52,617 --> 01:07:54,576
It draws me.

835
01:07:57,546 --> 01:07:59,505
It's such a shambles.

836
01:08:00,391 --> 01:08:03,229
They try so hard, from so far back...

837
01:08:04,037 --> 01:08:06,875
Poor buggers.
They just want to be like us.

838
01:08:09,047 --> 01:08:13,526
They have this huge heart
and... huge ignorance.

839
01:08:15,217 --> 01:08:17,372
And they always keep their word.

840
01:08:17,502 --> 01:08:19,701
Ugh... Acorns!

841
01:08:20,508 --> 01:08:23,472
They're gathering acorns
and making coffee from them!

842
01:08:23,594 --> 01:08:25,349
That's what they're doing here.

843
01:08:25,477 --> 01:08:30,685
Mr Blair, we are buying a Picasso. OK?

844
01:08:31,808 --> 01:08:34,451
You don't mind
an occasional metaphor, do you?

845
01:08:34,573 --> 01:08:36,693
- Not at all.
- Good.

846
01:08:37,138 --> 01:08:41,344
Some people don't like my metaphors.
I don't know why, but...

847
01:08:41,466 --> 01:08:45,625
Anyway, everyone in this room
is buying the same Picasso.

848
01:08:46,275 --> 01:08:50,879
It's, uh, very rare.
Medium rare, well done. What the fuck?

849
01:08:51,003 --> 01:08:54,400
The bottom-line question is
"Did Picasso paint it?"

850
01:08:55,292 --> 01:08:58,255
And you're the man who is selling it to us.

851
01:08:58,898 --> 01:09:01,211
It is not my Picasso, Russell.

852
01:09:02,104 --> 01:09:06,070
It is not my Picasso.
And I'm not saying it is a Picasso.

853
01:09:06,632 --> 01:09:09,389
And furthermore, I'm not selling it to you.

854
01:09:10,159 --> 01:09:14,398
And lastly, I don't give a fuck
whether you buy it or not.

855
01:09:25,187 --> 01:09:29,506
Quinn is army from the anus up.
He likes plain answers.

856
01:09:31,397 --> 01:09:33,631
I'll tell Barley.

857
01:09:35,685 --> 01:09:39,321
Have you ever had any homosexual
experiences, Mr Blair?

858
01:09:40,173 --> 01:09:43,137
Just the usual adolescent hand-held job.

859
01:09:44,181 --> 01:09:46,494
Same as yourself, I suppose?

860
01:09:47,828 --> 01:09:50,630
- Has this man been fluttered?
- What's that?

861
01:09:50,752 --> 01:09:53,716
Lie detector. No, Colonel, he hasn't.

862
01:09:56,163 --> 01:09:58,762
Your background is fairly liberal,
isn't it, Mr Blair?

863
01:09:58,888 --> 01:10:01,360
- Background?
- Your father.

864
01:10:01,493 --> 01:10:06,052
No. My father hated liberals.
He took the communist line mainly.

865
01:10:07,543 --> 01:10:09,697
Your father died eight years ago?

866
01:10:09,828 --> 01:10:10,739
Yes.

867
01:10:10,869 --> 01:10:14,790
Which is about the time your visits
to the Soviet Union became pretty regular.

868
01:10:14,917 --> 01:10:18,633
- I hadn't made the connection.
- Have you formed any connection

869
01:10:18,764 --> 01:10:23,449
with any peaceniks, dissidents
or other unofficial groups of that nature?

870
01:10:24,455 --> 01:10:27,977
You meet all sorts.
Jazz people, book people...

871
01:10:28,102 --> 01:10:31,179
That's an impossible question. I'm sorry.

872
01:10:31,708 --> 01:10:35,833
Well, let me turn that around and ask if
you've made any connection, whatsoever,

873
01:10:35,955 --> 01:10:37,870
with any peace people in England?

874
01:10:37,999 --> 01:10:42,079
Oh, hundreds, I should think.
You have to stay indoors to avoid them.

875
01:10:42,207 --> 01:10:44,487
Are there any musicians
you fraternise with

876
01:10:44,612 --> 01:10:49,536
whom you would describe, or who would
describe themselves, as anarchists?

877
01:10:52,185 --> 01:10:54,544
Ah. There was a trombone player.

878
01:10:56,513 --> 01:10:58,907
Wilfred Baker was his name.

879
01:10:59,359 --> 01:11:01,593
He's the only jazz musician I can recall

880
01:11:01,723 --> 01:11:05,324
who was completely devoid
of anarchist tendencies.

881
01:11:08,615 --> 01:11:12,058
Do you disapprove of the English
social structure, Mr Blair?

882
01:11:12,381 --> 01:11:15,859
Absolutely. Give me America every time.

883
01:11:16,229 --> 01:11:18,350
- Thank you, Mr Blair.
- Not at all.

884
01:11:18,474 --> 01:11:22,075
But you seem to go to Russia
rather more than you come to America.

885
01:11:22,201 --> 01:11:24,878
Yes. Because I prefer Russia.

886
01:11:26,368 --> 01:11:31,406
It's as corrupt as America, but...
there's less bullshit.

887
01:11:35,946 --> 01:11:40,948
He acted like a man who's going
his own way. Wouldn't you say?

888
01:11:43,479 --> 01:11:47,639
I'd say he behaved like someone
who didn't need to be careful.

889
01:11:48,609 --> 01:11:50,569
He might have.

890
01:11:51,333 --> 01:11:55,459
Oh, Ren? Mr Blair likes to have
a bottle of Scotch in his room.

891
01:11:56,783 --> 01:11:58,778
After his cricket.

892
01:12:01,232 --> 01:12:03,386
- Very good.
- That was nearly a six.

893
01:12:03,797 --> 01:12:05,073
Mr Brady, Barley.

894
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:08,277
Looks like you've done
a fine thing, Barley.

895
01:12:08,405 --> 01:12:11,082
Anybody say thank you along the way?

896
01:12:11,210 --> 01:12:12,725
No.

897
01:12:12,852 --> 01:12:16,648
Did I read somewhere you once played
in the great Ray Noble's band?

898
01:12:16,781 --> 01:12:19,424
Ah. A beardless boy in those days, Brady.

899
01:12:20,067 --> 01:12:22,140
Wasn't Ray the sweetest man
you ever met?

900
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:23,945
Ray was a prince.

901
01:12:24,073 --> 01:12:26,352
Did you ever play chess with him?

902
01:12:26,918 --> 01:12:29,916
- As a matter of fact, I did.
- Who won?

903
01:12:30,646 --> 01:12:33,006
- I did.
- So did I.

904
01:12:42,467 --> 01:12:47,267
Close your eyes, please.
No undue excitation of any kind.

905
01:12:47,396 --> 01:12:49,197
Always answer truthfully.

906
01:12:59,218 --> 01:13:01,737
Answers to be "yes" or "no" only.

907
01:13:01,863 --> 01:13:03,823
Merv.

908
01:13:04,347 --> 01:13:06,307
Is your name Blair?

909
01:13:06,671 --> 01:13:08,711
Scott Blair.

910
01:13:08,835 --> 01:13:12,117
- Is your name Scott Blair?
- Yes.

911
01:13:18,653 --> 01:13:19,610
No.

912
01:13:19,736 --> 01:13:21,970
- I am being blackmailed.
- No.

913
01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:24,299
I am being coerced.

914
01:13:24,424 --> 01:13:25,575
Yes.

915
01:13:25,707 --> 01:13:27,506
By the Soviets?

916
01:13:27,630 --> 01:13:28,667
No.

917
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:36,594
I am operating in collusion
with the woman Katya Orlova.

918
01:13:36,727 --> 01:13:38,208
No.

919
01:13:38,329 --> 01:13:40,324
Yes. What do you mean?

920
01:13:40,454 --> 01:13:42,812
- Hold it.
- Don't break the rhythm, Mr Blair.

921
01:13:42,938 --> 01:13:47,144
We have people do that on purpose
just to shake off a bad question.

922
01:13:47,266 --> 01:13:50,230
I am operating on behalf
of the Soviet Union.

923
01:13:50,352 --> 01:13:53,315
- No.
- In collusion with Katya Orlova.

924
01:13:53,438 --> 01:13:56,355
- No.
- I am the lover of Katya Orlova.

925
01:13:57,244 --> 01:13:57,961
No.

926
01:13:58,086 --> 01:14:01,402
I am motivated
by my love for Katya Orlova.

927
01:14:01,932 --> 01:14:03,609
No.

928
01:14:09,787 --> 01:14:11,746
Get rid of him, Clive.

929
01:14:13,153 --> 01:14:17,200
He's wrong for us.
Put in a professional. One of our people.

930
01:14:17,801 --> 01:14:21,278
If Dante's a good boy,
he gets the jackpot. I'll see to it.

931
01:14:21,409 --> 01:14:24,771
A million's no problem.
Ten million's even better.

932
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:28,132
That way Dante's a traitor
our patriots can understand.

933
01:14:28,261 --> 01:14:32,865
Dante won't deal with a professional.
He won't be bribed or threatened.

934
01:14:32,989 --> 01:14:35,874
He's straight. Do you remember straight?

935
01:14:36,516 --> 01:14:39,753
Nobody hired us
for our brotherly love, Ned.

936
01:14:45,211 --> 01:14:47,171
Russell.

937
01:14:50,623 --> 01:14:52,935
- Brady?
- Clive?

938
01:14:54,309 --> 01:14:56,304
Is there a seat on your plane?

939
01:14:56,432 --> 01:14:58,392
Of course.

940
01:15:17,672 --> 01:15:19,631
Barley?

941
01:15:21,439 --> 01:15:23,398
Barley?

942
01:15:25,446 --> 01:15:27,405
You've won!

943
01:15:30,335 --> 01:15:32,773
You've beaten their whole apparatus.

944
01:15:33,340 --> 01:15:35,460
There'll be no turning back now.

945
01:15:35,784 --> 01:15:38,908
Well done, Ned Jolly good show.

946
01:15:40,554 --> 01:15:45,590
Well, that's what you want, isn't it?
To go back to Moscow. To see it through.

947
01:15:47,886 --> 01:15:50,040
Three cheers for our side.

948
01:15:57,304 --> 01:16:00,700
Blair stays, and Langley
are taking over the case.

949
01:16:00,830 --> 01:16:03,395
They're preparing
a shopping list for Dante.

950
01:16:03,515 --> 01:16:07,357
It'll be the list to end all lists.
A grand-slam questionnaire.

951
01:16:07,483 --> 01:16:10,640
Pentagon, Defense, State...
Endorsed by the president.

952
01:16:10,769 --> 01:16:13,241
You made them a present of my joe?

953
01:16:13,775 --> 01:16:17,409
The role of the Russia House
will be respected. Russell values the link.

954
01:16:17,541 --> 01:16:21,062
We're taking over Barley's resettlement
and his pension, Ned.

955
01:16:21,187 --> 01:16:23,548
You gave away my joe for his pension?

956
01:16:23,673 --> 01:16:26,272
We're on the same bloody side,
aren't we?

957
01:16:26,397 --> 01:16:30,523
God, this is a list of questions that could
unlock all the Sov military secrets

958
01:16:30,645 --> 01:16:32,640
and win the arms race at a stroke!

959
01:16:32,768 --> 01:16:36,165
Or lose it. I don't like lists, Clive.

960
01:16:36,536 --> 01:16:39,339
Lists tell you too much
about the people who make them.

961
01:16:39,461 --> 01:16:42,539
I think you'll enjoy our facility.

962
01:16:42,667 --> 01:16:45,584
Bloody marvellous.
Blair's tapes encrypted,

963
01:16:45,713 --> 01:16:49,952
bounced by satellite to London,
then decrypted - all in minutes.

964
01:17:02,142 --> 01:17:04,502
Ah, Vladimir.

965
01:17:04,627 --> 01:17:08,103
You know my partner, JP Henziger?
No, you don't? You should.

966
01:17:08,234 --> 01:17:11,391
- Leonard Wicklow, my associate.
- Jack Henziger.

967
01:17:11,521 --> 01:17:13,435
Spikey! They let you in again?

968
01:17:13,564 --> 01:17:16,322
- Not bankrupt yet?
- No. Close, but no cigar. Here.

969
01:17:16,449 --> 01:17:19,287
- Party on Thursday. Live music.
- Hey.

970
01:17:20,456 --> 01:17:22,974
Bit early in the day even for me, George.

971
01:17:23,101 --> 01:17:25,142
Er, Leonard Wicklow, JP Henziger.

972
01:17:25,266 --> 01:17:27,738
- Brought your saxophone?
- But of course.

973
01:17:27,910 --> 01:17:33,278
Alik. A cordial invitation from
Potomac Blair to a party on Thursday.

974
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:36,124
- So what was so important in Leningrad?
- Come on.

975
01:17:36,245 --> 01:17:39,048
You don't care about Leningrad, do you?

976
01:17:39,170 --> 01:17:41,405
I'm sorry I disappeared. Here.

977
01:17:42,457 --> 01:17:45,694
If she was young and beautiful,
I forgive you.

978
01:17:49,229 --> 01:17:52,910
It is so good, Barley.
Really, it is so good to see you.

979
01:17:53,917 --> 01:17:56,881
Welcome to Moscow again.
Welcome to the book fair.

980
01:17:57,003 --> 01:17:59,282
To hell with the book fair.

981
01:18:26,177 --> 01:18:28,456
This is too beautiful to wear.

982
01:18:46,133 --> 01:18:48,857
She is asking... are you married?

983
01:18:49,860 --> 01:18:52,094
No. Not at present.

984
01:18:52,465 --> 01:18:55,507
But tell her that I'm always open to offers.

985
01:19:25,845 --> 01:19:28,490
Lapta! Lapta!

986
01:19:29,573 --> 01:19:31,646
Baseball, cricket...

987
01:19:31,777 --> 01:19:33,896
What's he saying?

988
01:19:34,021 --> 01:19:37,498
Matvey assures me lapta is the origin

989
01:19:37,627 --> 01:19:40,705
of American baseball
and your English cricket.

990
01:19:40,833 --> 01:19:43,957
He believes it was introduced to you
by Russian immigrants.

991
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:47,681
Well, if that's true,
it's the end of the British Empire.

992
01:20:02,273 --> 01:20:03,994
Now, my news.

993
01:20:04,116 --> 01:20:07,398
After your meeting with Yakov
he missed his next phone call.

994
01:20:07,522 --> 01:20:09,562
I was very worried. But it is all right.

995
01:20:09,686 --> 01:20:13,972
Yakov wrote me a long letter.
He was ill, but he has recovered.

996
01:20:14,094 --> 01:20:18,858
He will make a special visit to Moscow
during the book fair to meet you.

997
01:20:18,983 --> 01:20:21,422
- How was he ill?
- With gipetit.

998
01:20:22,509 --> 01:20:26,475
I... Prasti. Sorry. Er, hepatitis?

999
01:20:27,037 --> 01:20:28,793
I will read it to you.

1000
01:20:28,921 --> 01:20:31,805
It arrived eight days ago.
Igor telephoned at my house.

1001
01:20:31,927 --> 01:20:34,925
- Who's Igor?
- A trusted friend of Yakov.

1002
01:20:35,052 --> 01:20:39,657
He telephoned. He said "I have some
medicine for you." Medicine is a letter.

1003
01:20:39,781 --> 01:20:43,575
I thought he didn't have
any trusted friends except you.

1004
01:20:43,708 --> 01:20:45,908
What does he do, this Igor?

1005
01:20:46,594 --> 01:20:50,230
He is a scientist like Yakov,
at one of the ministries.

1006
01:20:50,722 --> 01:20:54,607
What does it matter? Do you wish me
to translate Yakov's letter or not?

1007
01:20:54,728 --> 01:20:56,688
Go on.

1008
01:20:58,054 --> 01:21:01,941
He is in a special hospital,
perhaps in a special town.

1009
01:21:02,063 --> 01:21:03,498
What town?

1010
01:21:03,625 --> 01:21:08,468
Some of our towns have no names,
even today. Only postal numbers.

1011
01:21:11,679 --> 01:21:13,799
"My darling Katya..."

1012
01:21:19,053 --> 01:21:22,940
He writes love talk. I shall not translate.

1013
01:21:23,982 --> 01:21:25,738
Does he usually do that?

1014
01:21:25,865 --> 01:21:29,102
What "usually"?
It is not usually he writes to me.

1015
01:21:29,592 --> 01:21:31,587
Ah, now we come to you.

1016
01:21:37,007 --> 01:21:42,887
"Please tell our good friend that I shall
try my best to see him during his visit."

1017
01:21:43,017 --> 01:21:48,101
"I will bring more material. If he has
a message for me, he must tell you."

1018
01:21:50,511 --> 01:21:52,551
Do you have a message?

1019
01:21:53,076 --> 01:21:55,035
No. No.

1020
01:21:56,362 --> 01:21:58,755
"Tell him to bring all further questions,

1021
01:21:58,886 --> 01:22:02,967
because after this I do not wish
to answer any more questions."

1022
01:22:03,095 --> 01:22:07,174
"Tell him his list should be final and..."

1023
01:22:09,425 --> 01:22:11,545
Like... complete.

1024
01:22:12,711 --> 01:22:14,147
Comprehensive?

1025
01:22:14,274 --> 01:22:17,352
Yes. Comprehensive.

1026
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:19,721
Com... Comprehensive.

1027
01:22:20,246 --> 01:22:22,400
Full marks.

1028
01:22:31,025 --> 01:22:36,189
He says "Please bring
a sample page of translation,

1029
01:22:36,315 --> 01:22:38,833
but in print, please, if you can."

1030
01:22:39,481 --> 01:22:43,527
"Tell me publishing dates.
Which is the best season?"

1031
01:22:43,648 --> 01:22:44,639
Um...

1032
01:22:44,770 --> 01:22:48,085
"Please make your suggestions
for a title."

1033
01:22:48,737 --> 01:22:54,061
"Will there be an introduction to the
book? Who will write the... digest?"

1034
01:22:56,391 --> 01:22:58,625
Er, the blurb.

1035
01:23:00,158 --> 01:23:01,879
Blurb?

1036
01:23:02,001 --> 01:23:03,961
Yes, the blurb.

1037
01:23:06,531 --> 01:23:08,490
Blurb?!

1038
01:23:09,015 --> 01:23:10,610
Oh!

1039
01:23:13,583 --> 01:23:17,185
Er, it's a war wound.
It's very good. You must tell her.

1040
01:23:17,310 --> 01:23:19,782
- You tell her.
- Fantastic.

1041
01:23:39,110 --> 01:23:41,470
When do you speak to Yakov again?

1042
01:23:44,239 --> 01:23:48,080
You cannot come to the hospital, Barley.
It is not safe.

1043
01:23:48,807 --> 01:23:52,010
If it's not safe for me,
then it's not safe for you.

1044
01:23:54,458 --> 01:23:57,581
- How does he end his letter?
- That is not for you.

1045
01:23:58,425 --> 01:24:02,106
- More love talk, hm?
- Barley, I think it is clear to hedgehog

1046
01:24:02,232 --> 01:24:04,796
that you are being a little childish.

1047
01:24:07,723 --> 01:24:09,762
Which hedgehog?

1048
01:24:10,607 --> 01:24:12,842
Why does he write like that?

1049
01:24:14,094 --> 01:24:18,014
He is lonely. He exaggerates
his feelings. It is normal.

1050
01:24:21,427 --> 01:24:22,989
Yeah.

1051
01:24:23,431 --> 01:24:25,391
It's normal.

1052
01:24:43,187 --> 01:24:45,945
That's it! No more! No more fucking tapes!

1053
01:24:58,095 --> 01:25:01,058
Final and comprehensive list. Why?

1054
01:25:02,061 --> 01:25:04,101
He's nervous. Why not?

1055
01:25:04,746 --> 01:25:06,901
Maybe I don't mind the list.

1056
01:25:07,030 --> 01:25:09,596
Maybe I mind him
writing her chatty letters.

1057
01:25:09,716 --> 01:25:11,676
People do when they've been ill.

1058
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:16,086
Maybe I mind the red car and
the white car. You saw the watch report.

1059
01:25:16,208 --> 01:25:18,601
And Igor. Igor who? Igor when?

1060
01:25:18,732 --> 01:25:20,532
Ned, Ned, Ned, Ned, Ned!

1061
01:25:22,418 --> 01:25:26,385
It's early days. We're all jumpy.

1062
01:25:46,383 --> 01:25:47,943
Katya, Katya.

1063
01:25:48,065 --> 01:25:52,670
Did you know Agatha Christie?
Matvey is crazy for detective fiction.

1064
01:25:52,794 --> 01:25:55,712
Alas, Agatha and I were never introduced.

1065
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:59,966
Raymond Chandler,
Dorothy Sayers, Conan Doyle...

1066
01:26:03,735 --> 01:26:05,808
Leningrad.

1067
01:26:05,939 --> 01:26:07,898
Family.

1068
01:26:08,623 --> 01:26:10,619
Family. Da.

1069
01:26:20,766 --> 01:26:22,920
What's he saying now?

1070
01:26:31,786 --> 01:26:34,224
He is talking about the siege.

1071
01:26:37,276 --> 01:26:42,280
The Germans were four kilometres
from Leningrad on the south side.

1072
01:26:42,405 --> 01:26:44,684
- I love you.
- You can still see...

1073
01:26:45,571 --> 01:26:51,178
the marks of the machine-gun fire
in the old buildings in the outskirts.

1074
01:26:51,301 --> 01:26:52,578
I love you.

1075
01:26:52,704 --> 01:26:56,100
All my failings were
preparations for meeting you.

1076
01:26:57,834 --> 01:27:01,993
The city refused to... accept defeat.

1077
01:27:02,563 --> 01:27:07,440
- Shostakovich still composed music...
- It's like nothing I have ever known.

1078
01:27:08,493 --> 01:27:10,054
It's...

1079
01:27:11,057 --> 01:27:14,454
unselfish love. Grown-up love.

1080
01:27:14,585 --> 01:27:16,819
- You know it is.
- Barley, please.

1081
01:27:16,949 --> 01:27:18,988
It's mature, absolute,

1082
01:27:20,755 --> 01:27:22,954
thrilling love.

1083
01:27:24,602 --> 01:27:27,362
You have bewitched my family.

1084
01:27:27,849 --> 01:27:33,616
My children think all you British are now
Santa Claus in beautiful tweed clothes.

1085
01:27:34,260 --> 01:27:38,546
There's no Santa Claus.
And nobody is what he seems.

1086
01:27:38,668 --> 01:27:40,628
Except you.

1087
01:27:41,353 --> 01:27:45,320
Why do you want to take away my rights?
Go and sit down.

1088
01:27:52,453 --> 01:27:57,331
I hope you are not being frivolous, Barley.
My life now only has room for truth.

1089
01:28:08,122 --> 01:28:09,922
- What are you doing?
- Shh.

1090
01:28:46,112 --> 01:28:48,472
I'm with you.

1091
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:14,439
I know it now.

1092
01:29:54,117 --> 01:29:56,429
A final and comprehensive list.

1093
01:29:57,242 --> 01:29:59,841
One chance, then close down.

1094
01:30:01,289 --> 01:30:02,247
Why?

1095
01:30:02,372 --> 01:30:05,255
I really think you should get some sleep.

1096
01:30:05,377 --> 01:30:08,534
- I don't think I'm tired.
- Oh, I think you are.

1097
01:30:09,144 --> 01:30:10,900
I think you're tired as hell.

1098
01:30:11,027 --> 01:30:15,392
If the Sovs were playing Dante back at us,
they wouldn't close him down.

1099
01:30:15,515 --> 01:30:18,878
You wouldn't close him down
if you were Sov, would you?

1100
01:30:19,003 --> 01:30:21,237
I might have to
if my methods were Russian.

1101
01:30:21,366 --> 01:30:22,928
Why?

1102
01:30:23,570 --> 01:30:26,852
Because Dante may not
be presentable any more.

1103
01:30:27,537 --> 01:30:32,142
He may not be able to use the telephone.
He may not be able to use a spoon.

1104
01:30:34,151 --> 01:30:36,110
He may be dead.

1105
01:30:37,396 --> 01:30:40,838
Dante is going to phone Katya
at the hospital today.

1106
01:30:41,603 --> 01:30:44,681
If he does that, will you shut the fuck up?

1107
01:30:46,051 --> 01:30:48,250
Or stay out of my operation?

1108
01:30:52,985 --> 01:30:55,378
You must be very quiet.

1109
01:30:55,909 --> 01:31:00,513
If the children come, we must dress
and we must be very serious.

1110
01:31:01,359 --> 01:31:03,479
I'll tell them I love you.

1111
01:31:04,005 --> 01:31:05,964
I shall not interpret.

1112
01:31:07,051 --> 01:31:09,010
Can I tell you?

1113
01:31:09,655 --> 01:31:11,649
If you are quiet.

1114
01:31:11,779 --> 01:31:13,738
Will you interpret?

1115
01:31:19,393 --> 01:31:21,753
You are my only country now.

1116
01:31:43,116 --> 01:31:45,076
Sorry I'm late.

1117
01:33:08,273 --> 01:33:09,913
Da?

1118
01:33:11,478 --> 01:33:12,515
Are you connected?

1119
01:33:13,642 --> 01:33:15,841
- Bingo.
- We're in business.

1120
01:33:17,889 --> 01:33:20,249
What did he say? Tell me.

1121
01:33:25,064 --> 01:33:28,266
That's a neat fit.
Dante keeps it short.

1122
01:33:28,389 --> 01:33:30,907
Embracing?

1123
01:33:31,034 --> 01:33:32,993
They're happy.

1124
01:33:36,123 --> 01:33:38,483
- Why is he driving?
- Men like to drive women.

1125
01:33:38,608 --> 01:33:40,807
He's a male chauvinist.

1126
01:34:05,577 --> 01:34:09,098
- Your people saying he's still in the flat?
- You see what I see.

1127
01:34:28,018 --> 01:34:30,537
Come on, come on, where's the tape?

1128
01:34:33,227 --> 01:34:35,187
Geronimo.

1129
01:34:36,433 --> 01:34:39,636
Hello, Barley.
What do you think of Cy's lorry?

1130
01:34:39,759 --> 01:34:42,404
- Or "truck", as he calls it.
- It's very impressive.

1131
01:34:42,525 --> 01:34:44,838
- How'd it go, Barley?
- Good.

1132
01:34:44,969 --> 01:34:48,365
Well, we're bang on target, Paddy.
The meeting is on.

1133
01:34:48,576 --> 01:34:52,336
Dante's coming to Moscow on Friday.
He's borrowing that apartment.

1134
01:34:52,462 --> 01:34:54,822
- Well done. What time?
- 1800.

1135
01:34:54,947 --> 01:34:56,703
Good.

1136
01:34:57,432 --> 01:34:59,391
Anything unusual?

1137
01:34:59,917 --> 01:35:04,555
No. Nothing I couldn't handle.
But Katya's not as tough as she thought.

1138
01:35:05,566 --> 01:35:08,564
Wound herself up a bit, I think,
waiting for that phone call.

1139
01:35:08,692 --> 01:35:12,740
But I gave her a cup of tea
and held her hand for a bit.

1140
01:35:15,305 --> 01:35:17,105
Well done.

1141
01:35:19,112 --> 01:35:21,266
Well done indeed.

1142
01:35:35,461 --> 01:35:37,217
Leo, good to see you.

1143
01:35:37,345 --> 01:35:39,544
How's Olga? Still eating?

1144
01:35:39,668 --> 01:35:41,424
How's your dog, Barley?

1145
01:35:41,553 --> 01:35:44,517
Arkady. I haven't got a dog.
Why do you ask?

1146
01:35:44,639 --> 01:35:48,719
Because it's safer to discuss one's dog,
I would say, than one's friends.

1147
01:35:48,846 --> 01:35:50,966
Getting careless in our excitement, huh?

1148
01:35:51,090 --> 01:35:54,532
The informants will have
a good harvest this season.

1149
01:35:56,019 --> 01:35:58,140
- Hello, Barley.
- Alik.

1150
01:36:33,248 --> 01:36:35,207
Katya.

1151
01:36:40,501 --> 01:36:43,542
- Are you well?
- Thank you, I am very well.

1152
01:36:45,350 --> 01:36:47,869
Now, who don't you know?

1153
01:36:55,888 --> 01:36:57,928
Comrades! Ladies and gentlemen!

1154
01:36:58,172 --> 01:37:01,490
To you, and to our
new partnership, welcome.

1155
01:37:02,140 --> 01:37:04,374
Let's make each other free.

1156
01:37:04,505 --> 01:37:07,707
And let's make each other rich.

1157
01:37:07,831 --> 01:37:09,826
We want Barley!

1158
01:37:09,954 --> 01:37:12,793
Barley! Give us a tune! Come on!

1159
01:37:13,881 --> 01:37:16,959
Barley! Barley! Barley! Barley!

1160
01:37:19,773 --> 01:37:24,810
Wickers, you've got a real publisher in
you. When this business is over, go for it.

1161
01:38:30,422 --> 01:38:32,462
- Why Zapadny?
- Ned!

1162
01:38:32,947 --> 01:38:36,947
Barley buys Soviet books.
He's keeping his cover in trim.

1163
01:38:45,529 --> 01:38:47,730
Call it off, Russell.

1164
01:38:49,938 --> 01:38:52,251
You're not tired. You're sick!

1165
01:38:52,823 --> 01:38:54,544
Pixie voices!

1166
01:38:54,666 --> 01:38:58,872
If Dante is blown, Katya's blown.
Why is she still walking around?

1167
01:38:58,994 --> 01:39:00,349
I don't know.

1168
01:39:00,476 --> 01:39:03,920
OK. If Dante's blown,
who was on the hospital phone?

1169
01:39:04,405 --> 01:39:05,361
I don't know.

1170
01:39:05,487 --> 01:39:07,560
If it wasn't Dante,
why didn't she tell Barley?

1171
01:39:07,691 --> 01:39:10,573
And if she did tell Barley,
why isn't Barley telling us?

1172
01:39:10,696 --> 01:39:12,211
I don't know.

1173
01:39:12,378 --> 01:39:15,023
Don't give us hunches. Give us facts.

1174
01:39:15,144 --> 01:39:18,986
You brought us into this. Don't jump
off the tiger at the first fucking stop!

1175
01:39:19,112 --> 01:39:20,946
It's over, Russell.

1176
01:39:21,196 --> 01:39:23,076
Dante is straight.

1177
01:39:23,199 --> 01:39:26,037
Those were your words,
and I loved you for them.

1178
01:39:26,404 --> 01:39:28,159
Ned.

1179
01:39:28,608 --> 01:39:30,603
He's blown.

1180
01:39:30,732 --> 01:39:33,571
We had him, but we lost him.

1181
01:39:34,019 --> 01:39:35,853
It's over.

1182
01:39:36,704 --> 01:39:41,502
And my joe's out there
telling us that he's bang on target.

1183
01:40:05,276 --> 01:40:08,239
This is the flat
where Dante is waiting.

1184
01:40:08,361 --> 01:40:12,157
You'll be glad to hear that
the lift was working this morning.

1185
01:40:12,288 --> 01:40:15,525
Fourth floor, green-painted door,
bang opposite the lift.

1186
01:40:15,655 --> 01:40:19,540
Right. Then in that case
this will be your window.

1187
01:40:20,424 --> 01:40:23,466
Now, when you get in,
let us see you at that window.

1188
01:40:24,552 --> 01:40:25,987
Good.

1189
01:40:26,114 --> 01:40:29,556
Jack will walk you halfway.
Then you're on your own.

1190
01:40:29,680 --> 01:40:34,125
Tell Dante you want to walk out
with as many answers as he can give you.

1191
01:40:35,531 --> 01:40:37,492
This is it. The shopping list.

1192
01:40:37,615 --> 01:40:41,854
You'll have to tell him to wet the pages.
The questions will float to the surface.

1193
01:40:41,983 --> 01:40:44,342
Uh, make sure you bring it back.

1194
01:40:45,629 --> 01:40:48,707
We think the whole thing
will take two hours. Three, for luck.

1195
01:40:48,835 --> 01:40:51,959
Tell him you want a date
for a final meeting to fill in the blanks.

1196
01:40:52,082 --> 01:40:56,128
And when you want to leave,
pull the curtain. We'll pick you up.

1197
01:40:56,249 --> 01:40:57,765
How's that?

1198
01:40:57,892 --> 01:40:59,852
Good.

1199
01:40:59,976 --> 01:41:04,101
Give this to Ned, will you?
Just in case something goes wrong.

1200
01:41:05,185 --> 01:41:07,384
Nothing's going wrong.

1201
01:41:26,745 --> 01:41:29,787
That's it over there. Second from the right.

1202
01:41:42,454 --> 01:41:44,608
You'll be fine from here, Barley.

1203
01:41:46,060 --> 01:41:48,020
Fingers crossed, Jack.

1204
01:41:48,745 --> 01:41:50,704
Cheerio.

1205
01:42:15,755 --> 01:42:17,714
Thank you.

1206
01:42:24,211 --> 01:42:27,892
Sir, the shopping list...
It's only questions, isn't it?

1207
01:42:28,017 --> 01:42:31,060
- It wouldn't tell anyone anything?
- Everything.

1208
01:42:31,704 --> 01:42:34,826
It would tell what we know
by telling what we don't know.

1209
01:42:34,949 --> 01:42:37,912
And it would tell
what we would most like to know.

1210
01:42:38,035 --> 01:42:41,591
If the Sovs get the list, we might as well
have published the notebooks,

1211
01:42:41,723 --> 01:42:44,160
just as Barley promised Dante.

1212
01:42:48,254 --> 01:42:50,453
Yes, I do know.

1213
01:42:52,261 --> 01:42:54,860
Barley's made a deal.

1214
01:42:54,987 --> 01:42:58,508
He's keeping his promise to Dante
in his own way.

1215
01:42:58,634 --> 01:43:01,027
And he's trying to save Katya.

1216
01:43:01,158 --> 01:43:03,232
- He's giving them the list!
- Come on, Ned.

1217
01:43:03,362 --> 01:43:06,484
The Sovs are just waiting
for Barley to give it to them.

1218
01:43:06,607 --> 01:43:08,408
Jesus Christ!

1219
01:43:15,024 --> 01:43:17,622
- Brock, signal the truck.
- Don't!

1220
01:43:17,748 --> 01:43:19,469
- Signal Paddy. Abort.
- Don't!

1221
01:43:29,009 --> 01:43:31,128
Looking good!

1222
01:43:31,253 --> 01:43:33,896
And he's coming back smiling.

1223
01:43:34,379 --> 01:43:36,817
And you can take a long, long vacation.

1224
01:43:38,706 --> 01:43:40,860
My joe's crossed over.

1225
01:44:35,891 --> 01:44:37,452
He went in.

1226
01:44:38,015 --> 01:44:40,010
He never came out.

1227
01:44:40,139 --> 01:44:42,099
About seven hours.

1228
01:44:42,664 --> 01:44:44,339
Yes, sir.

1229
01:44:51,400 --> 01:44:53,634
Shit city, Ned.

1230
01:45:01,458 --> 01:45:03,578
Honour is due.

1231
01:45:13,159 --> 01:45:16,920
Well, folks, better put
the chairs back on the tables.

1232
01:45:20,894 --> 01:45:22,853
Till next time.

1233
01:45:37,203 --> 01:45:39,517
Yekaterina Borisovna Orlova.

1234
01:45:39,648 --> 01:45:41,608
Yes. Katya.

1235
01:45:41,732 --> 01:45:47,419
- The letter was signed "Katya"?
- No, just the initial. "Your loving K."

1236
01:45:47,784 --> 01:45:51,385
British Intelligence showed you
the letter for the first time in Lisbon?

1237
01:45:51,510 --> 01:45:52,068
Yes.

1238
01:45:52,191 --> 01:45:56,590
And it referred to your first meeting
with Savelyev, whom you know as Dante?

1239
01:45:56,719 --> 01:45:58,953
Yes. At Peredelkino.

1240
01:45:59,083 --> 01:46:01,043
But Mrs Orlova was not at Peredelkino?

1241
01:46:01,168 --> 01:46:05,532
- As I keep telling you, I didn't meet her...
- Please. Allow me.

1242
01:46:06,297 --> 01:46:09,773
Did Savelyev arrive at Peredelkino
by himself or with others?

1243
01:46:09,904 --> 01:46:12,547
I don't know. Why don't you ask him?

1244
01:46:12,869 --> 01:46:15,752
Unfortunately,
Professor Savelyev is dead.

1245
01:46:15,874 --> 01:46:18,347
He became very ill with hepatitis.

1246
01:46:19,962 --> 01:46:23,199
A great loss to the Soviet
scientific community.

1247
01:46:24,249 --> 01:46:26,050
We all mourn him.

1248
01:46:29,779 --> 01:46:31,739
Me too.

1249
01:46:33,227 --> 01:46:36,589
I have nothing further
to add to what I have said.

1250
01:46:36,993 --> 01:46:40,150
You have the shopping list -
payment in full.

1251
01:46:41,121 --> 01:46:43,685
Yes. The celebrated list.

1252
01:46:44,406 --> 01:46:48,407
We have a deal.
I expect you to honour that deal.

1253
01:46:49,336 --> 01:46:52,333
Yes, I'm talking about honour,
not ideology.

1254
01:46:52,501 --> 01:46:57,824
I've left a letter behind me just in case
they don't know the difference.

1255
01:47:03,081 --> 01:47:05,475
Tell me about the letter.

1256
01:47:08,451 --> 01:47:11,687
"Dear Nedski, change of plan, old chum."

1257
01:47:13,219 --> 01:47:15,453
"Sorry I couldn't let you know."

1258
01:47:15,583 --> 01:47:18,467
"I thought you'd be onto me
if anyone was."

1259
01:47:19,711 --> 01:47:22,184
"But perhaps you taught me too well."

1260
01:47:23,077 --> 01:47:26,234
"Anyway, Dante is blown,
as you would say."

1261
01:47:28,247 --> 01:47:30,526
"His letter to Katya was a fake."

1262
01:47:31,452 --> 01:47:35,089
"His phone call to the hospital
was KGB-controlled."

1263
01:47:35,741 --> 01:47:38,738
"But Dante and Katya
had worked out a code."

1264
01:47:39,748 --> 01:47:41,947
What did he say?

1265
01:47:42,072 --> 01:47:43,667
Tell me.

1266
01:47:43,795 --> 01:47:47,511
He is taken. Yakov is taken.

1267
01:47:47,642 --> 01:47:50,287
"If he was caught,
he called her by the wrong name."

1268
01:47:50,408 --> 01:47:52,562
He used the wrong name.

1269
01:47:53,533 --> 01:47:57,819
If we are safe, he calls me Alina.
If... if he is caught, Maria.

1270
01:47:57,941 --> 01:48:00,061
He called me Maria.

1271
01:48:01,428 --> 01:48:04,071
He was telling me we are dead.

1272
01:48:15,173 --> 01:48:17,246
Give me the key.

1273
01:48:17,416 --> 01:48:21,977
"So there we were. And I was thinking
'Why haven't they arrested us?"'

1274
01:48:24,390 --> 01:48:26,669
"It took me a while to work it out."

1275
01:48:26,794 --> 01:48:30,190
"But of course!
They wanted the shopping list."

1276
01:48:31,042 --> 01:48:32,763
"So there was the crunch:

1277
01:48:32,885 --> 01:48:37,810
to save your precious secrets,
or to trade them for Katya and her family."

1278
01:48:37,935 --> 01:48:40,534
"The easiest decision I ever made."

1279
01:48:41,261 --> 01:48:44,897
"And if you wouldn't have done the same,
then you've learned nothing."

1280
01:48:45,027 --> 01:48:46,622
"Dante was right."

1281
01:48:46,751 --> 01:48:52,632
"The grey men are keeping alive the arms
race, which nobody is supposed to want."

1282
01:48:55,366 --> 01:48:59,447
"It's all over for the secrets game.
Your day is done, old boy."

1283
01:48:59,574 --> 01:49:01,773
"Publish and be safe."

1284
01:49:02,580 --> 01:49:06,466
I need to betray my country,
and I haven't got much time.

1285
01:49:07,910 --> 01:49:12,355
And don't tell me you don't know
who to get in touch with. Just do it, hm?

1286
01:49:16,244 --> 01:49:20,849
I want to meet them in the morning
and agree a contract. All right?

1287
01:49:25,181 --> 01:49:27,015
"I did my best for you, Ned."

1288
01:49:27,145 --> 01:49:30,347
"But now I have to do my best
for Dante, and for Katya."

1289
01:49:31,873 --> 01:49:34,072
Smile. You must smile.

1290
01:49:34,197 --> 01:49:37,321
They're watching us.
Your side and my side.

1291
01:49:38,326 --> 01:49:40,560
We're going to beat them both.

1292
01:49:44,697 --> 01:49:47,660
I can't save Yakov. Nothing can.

1293
01:49:50,628 --> 01:49:52,667
But you're safe.

1294
01:49:52,792 --> 01:49:55,870
The children are safe.
Uncle Matvey's safe.

1295
01:50:00,406 --> 01:50:02,365
I love you.

1296
01:50:03,051 --> 01:50:05,330
And I won't let you down.

1297
01:50:16,194 --> 01:50:20,958
"It was my first good contract.
Real people for unreal arguments."

1298
01:50:22,205 --> 01:50:24,805
"I got everything I wanted,

1299
01:50:24,931 --> 01:50:29,011
down to a safe passage for Wicklow,
Henziger and the others."

1300
01:50:31,142 --> 01:50:34,424
"No doubt there'll be
hell to pay at your end."

1301
01:50:35,589 --> 01:50:38,906
"But you shouldn't open
other people's letters."

1302
01:50:39,638 --> 01:50:42,601
"Love, and luck. Barley."

1303
01:50:46,931 --> 01:50:48,891
What about Russell?

1304
01:50:49,334 --> 01:50:51,569
Russell's a survivor.

1305
01:50:52,541 --> 01:50:56,143
Rumour has it that the shopping list
was really a brilliant deception,

1306
01:50:56,268 --> 01:50:58,741
planted on the Russians
by our clever Russell,

1307
01:50:58,873 --> 01:51:01,311
who also started the rumour.

1308
01:51:01,437 --> 01:51:06,281
If he can get the Sovs to believe it,
everything's back to square one.

1309
01:51:06,406 --> 01:51:08,719
Dante need never have bothered.

1310
01:51:09,973 --> 01:51:11,933
And Barley?

1311
01:51:12,738 --> 01:51:14,858
Oh, Barley.

1312
01:51:15,182 --> 01:51:18,305
He's home free. Back in Lisbon.

1313
01:51:18,428 --> 01:51:20,742
It's not a large flat, of course.

1314
01:51:21,553 --> 01:51:25,761
But by Moscow standards...
We'll all squeeze in.

1315
01:51:26,603 --> 01:51:28,997
Still backing your Russia, Barley?

1316
01:51:29,850 --> 01:51:31,809
Well, we'll see.

1317
01:51:31,933 --> 01:51:37,096
You know, I chose this flat because
I like to watch the ships come in.

1318
01:51:38,224 --> 01:51:41,348
I must have known
that one day it would be my ship.

1319
01:51:42,192 --> 01:51:45,190
And you think that Katya's
going to be on it?

1320
01:51:46,079 --> 01:51:48,473
Well, perhaps it's your due.

1321
01:51:48,603 --> 01:51:52,650
It took some guts. And you seem
to think you did the decent thing.

1322
01:51:56,018 --> 01:51:58,137
Good luck, Barley.

1323
01:52:24,549 --> 01:52:26,508
Katya!

1324
01:52:29,679 --> 01:52:31,639
Come on!

1325
01:52:34,648 --> 01:52:37,292
Come on, Katya! Come on!
