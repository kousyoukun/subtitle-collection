1
00:01:52,785 --> 00:01:53,376
Hello!

2
00:01:53,518 --> 00:01:55,711
Hello, is it Ha-tau? I'm Auntie!

3
00:01:55,885 --> 00:01:56,646
What's the matter?

4
00:01:56,818 --> 00:01:59,284
Are you still sleeping? I'll call you later

5
00:01:59,885 --> 00:02:00,908
OK!

6
00:02:19,585 --> 00:02:20,279
Hello!

7
00:02:20,851 --> 00:02:22,215
It's you again, Auntie!

8
00:02:22,352 --> 00:02:25,250
You still didn't get up! Then I call you later

9
00:02:25,419 --> 00:02:29,078
Oh, no need! Just go on!

10
00:02:29,218 --> 00:02:32,150
The problem is that your cousin is not feeling well

11
00:02:32,451 --> 00:02:35,975
and will go to see doctor! To avoid wasting time in travelling

12
00:02:36,118 --> 00:02:38,311
I'll let her live with you for several day! OK?

13
00:02:39,885 --> 00:02:41,317
Didn't I have a cousin really?

14
00:02:41,651 --> 00:02:44,776
She's your second uncle's daughter, Ah-ngor!

15
00:02:54,851 --> 00:02:56,147
Who is it?

16
00:03:08,185 --> 00:03:11,412
I just thought that you were out! I'm Ah-ngor!

17
00:03:12,052 --> 00:03:13,075
You are my cousin, aren't you?

18
00:03:13,551 --> 00:03:15,540
Just treat yourself at home!

19
00:03:15,751 --> 00:03:17,444
There are kitchen and washroom

20
00:03:18,518 --> 00:03:21,712
Hello! Someone's calling me! Tell him to call me later!

21
00:03:37,218 --> 00:03:37,876
Hello!

22
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:39,348
Hello! Can I speak to Brother Wah?

23
00:03:40,585 --> 00:03:42,448
He's sleeping. Who is calling?

24
00:03:42,918 --> 00:03:43,781
You don't even know me

25
00:03:43,885 --> 00:03:45,317
You must be his new friend

26
00:03:45,451 --> 00:03:46,781
I'm Fly! Who are you?

27
00:03:47,052 --> 00:03:48,109
I am his cousin!

28
00:03:48,285 --> 00:03:50,750
Cousin?! Never mind!

29
00:03:50,918 --> 00:03:53,146
Tell him that I'm waiting for bargaining with Fat-karl

30
00:03:53,352 --> 00:03:54,318
Tell him to contact me when he get up

31
00:03:54,451 --> 00:03:55,179
OK!

32
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,274
Hello!

33
00:04:59,384 --> 00:05:01,475
Hello, Cousin! Didn't Brother Wah get up?

34
00:05:02,418 --> 00:05:05,146
Didn't still! Is it urgent?

35
00:05:05,285 --> 00:05:06,273
Didn't you want me to wake him up?

36
00:05:06,651 --> 00:05:08,117
No, thanks! If he get up,

37
00:05:08,285 --> 00:05:10,012
tell him that I'm still waiting for Fat-karl

38
00:05:10,118 --> 00:05:10,981
and tell him to call me!

39
00:05:11,218 --> 00:05:12,013
OK!

40
00:06:04,318 --> 00:06:05,784
Go to sleep if you are tired!

41
00:06:05,952 --> 00:06:07,315
I could sleep in the living room tonight!

42
00:06:15,185 --> 00:06:16,810
Why do you wear a gauze-mask?

43
00:06:17,152 --> 00:06:18,515
To avoid infecting other!

44
00:06:22,284 --> 00:06:23,216
What kind of disease?

45
00:06:23,351 --> 00:06:25,045
The doctor said that my lung is malfunctioning

46
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:27,412
and tell me to see a specialist

47
00:06:29,351 --> 00:06:32,011
You won't die!

48
00:06:34,585 --> 00:06:36,312
Just eat more oranges and you'll be alright!

49
00:06:40,985 --> 00:06:41,973
So strange!

50
00:06:51,484 --> 00:06:52,745
A guy called Fly had phoned you

51
00:06:52,885 --> 00:06:54,544
several time a while ago!

52
00:06:57,618 --> 00:06:59,243
Really? What did he say?

53
00:07:02,885 --> 00:07:03,373
Hello!

54
00:07:03,518 --> 00:07:04,484
Hello, little cousin!

55
00:07:04,751 --> 00:07:05,876
Haven't Brother Wah get up?

56
00:07:06,985 --> 00:07:07,780
Hello!

57
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:09,510
I'm still staying with Fat-karl for collecting debt

58
00:07:09,818 --> 00:07:12,443
Damn it! You still haven't get the money till now?

59
00:07:12,751 --> 00:07:15,081
He's just making fun of you! You stay there and I come at once!

60
00:07:28,151 --> 00:07:29,549
I cannot go for dinner

61
00:07:29,685 --> 00:07:30,742
with you tonight!

62
00:07:34,451 --> 00:07:36,077
Here's one hundred dollars for your dinner!

63
00:07:36,384 --> 00:07:37,509
The key is under the carpet!

64
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:41,580
Take it off, would you? It isn't looking good

65
00:07:53,685 --> 00:07:55,117
Have a cup of tea first!

66
00:07:59,618 --> 00:08:01,982
Fat-karl, I tell you...

67
00:08:02,518 --> 00:08:04,177
I'm doing you favour to talk with you

68
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:05,680
for such a long time

69
00:08:07,384 --> 00:08:08,748
I, Fly, am not famous

70
00:08:08,952 --> 00:08:10,417
because I'm not qualified

71
00:08:10,785 --> 00:08:13,273
also my Big Brother always tell me to be subtle

72
00:08:13,751 --> 00:08:15,341
Did you know Mr Aeroplane of Agah-chee Wan?!

73
00:08:15,518 --> 00:08:17,313
He had made a debt of $1600

74
00:08:17,484 --> 00:08:18,711
and just paid it late for two days,

75
00:08:18,885 --> 00:08:21,078
now he cannot fly, and have to sit on a wheel chair

76
00:08:21,518 --> 00:08:24,541
I did that with my own hands

77
00:08:26,117 --> 00:08:27,447
Are you trying to frighten me?

78
00:08:27,651 --> 00:08:30,742
He, Aeroplane, is a nobody and cannot be compared to me

79
00:08:30,985 --> 00:08:32,177
I tell you...

80
00:08:32,418 --> 00:08:33,384
I, Fat-karl,

81
00:08:33,551 --> 00:08:35,244
never before have the habit of paying debt

82
00:08:35,451 --> 00:08:38,940
Let's say that Big-Circle who were more powerful...

83
00:08:39,117 --> 00:08:40,447
and now Big-Circle becomes Small-Circle!

84
00:08:40,651 --> 00:08:42,310
Do you know why?

85
00:08:42,484 --> 00:08:44,382
It was because he forced me to pay his debt,

86
00:08:44,484 --> 00:08:45,916
so I hit him nearly into death

87
00:08:46,084 --> 00:08:47,880
He now get only one eye left!

88
00:08:49,251 --> 00:08:50,410
Just having two years experience

89
00:08:50,618 --> 00:08:52,447
don't you have the guts to collect my debt?

90
00:08:52,718 --> 00:08:56,377
I got knife-scars more than the number of your leg's hair!

91
00:08:56,785 --> 00:08:59,876
Scar? My Big Brother has one! I'll cut myself if you have!

92
00:09:00,551 --> 00:09:02,073
Cut yourself then!

93
00:09:03,718 --> 00:09:04,706
Haven't you finish talking?

94
00:09:05,052 --> 00:09:06,711
We're in the beginning still!

95
00:09:07,418 --> 00:09:09,281
Still in the beginning for so many hours!

96
00:09:09,718 --> 00:09:10,547
Don't you want to die?

97
00:09:10,685 --> 00:09:12,583
Don't move! Everybody don't move!

98
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:15,239
Would you pay the debt?

99
00:09:15,918 --> 00:09:19,247
Yes, yes! Why wouldn't I?

100
00:09:21,751 --> 00:09:23,842
It's unbelievable! So easy!

101
00:09:24,418 --> 00:09:26,407
I know, just by his face, that he is a sheep wearing tiger's skin

102
00:09:26,651 --> 00:09:27,446
With so many companions,

103
00:09:27,618 --> 00:09:29,208
they will strike you in the very beginning if they have guts

104
00:09:29,351 --> 00:09:30,078
You are right!

105
00:09:30,184 --> 00:09:30,843
This is for you!

106
00:09:30,985 --> 00:09:31,848
Thank you, Brother!

107
00:09:35,851 --> 00:09:36,509
Where are you going Big Brother?

108
00:09:43,818 --> 00:09:44,647
Brother Wah!

109
00:09:46,985 --> 00:09:47,746
Visiting Mabel?

110
00:09:47,885 --> 00:09:48,213
Yeah!

111
00:09:48,384 --> 00:09:49,372
She hasn't go for work yet!

112
00:09:49,851 --> 00:09:50,612
I'll wait for her downstairs

113
00:09:50,685 --> 00:09:51,378
OK!

114
00:10:06,718 --> 00:10:08,343
That boutique has a lot of new arrival!

115
00:10:08,518 --> 00:10:09,108
Really?

116
00:10:09,284 --> 00:10:09,978
I'll go to the boutique with you some other day!

117
00:10:10,117 --> 00:10:10,981
OK!

118
00:10:16,785 --> 00:10:19,615
Mabel!
Mabel!

119
00:10:20,084 --> 00:10:21,107
Come here!

120
00:10:23,217 --> 00:10:25,445
I didn't have my dinner! Would you go eating with me!

121
00:10:29,484 --> 00:10:31,006
That's OK if you don't like to!

122
00:10:34,184 --> 00:10:37,082
Why did you go to work so lately?

123
00:10:37,251 --> 00:10:38,217
I just left from the hospital

124
00:10:39,318 --> 00:10:42,648
Just from the hospital? Why? Stomach-washing again?

125
00:10:42,785 --> 00:10:44,250
Not stomach-washing! It's abortion!

126
00:10:49,951 --> 00:10:51,042
Are you kidding?

127
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:52,548
You can treat it as kidding if you like to!

128
00:10:56,551 --> 00:10:59,016
No it won't! Why didn't you tell me that you were pregnant?

129
00:10:59,551 --> 00:11:00,881
Had you gave me a chance to tell me?

130
00:11:01,084 --> 00:11:03,175
I had waited for three day! But didn't you call me?

131
00:11:04,318 --> 00:11:07,148
You could call me if I didn't!

132
00:11:08,384 --> 00:11:10,213
Call you! What could I tell you?

133
00:11:10,351 --> 00:11:11,681
Tell you I'm going for abortion

134
00:11:11,818 --> 00:11:12,784
or tell you to marry me?

135
00:11:12,918 --> 00:11:15,406
We'd been together for six years! What did I get finally?

136
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:17,809
I felt like not knowing you

137
00:11:17,951 --> 00:11:19,542
and didn't even get any money

138
00:11:19,785 --> 00:11:22,876
I'm so poor that I had to borrow my mother's money for abortion!

139
00:11:23,017 --> 00:11:23,983
Speak up! What did I do for?

140
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:25,444
Shut up!

141
00:11:29,051 --> 00:11:29,608
Stop saying! Since the day we'd met,

142
00:11:29,885 --> 00:11:31,043
you knew already what kind of person I am

143
00:11:33,384 --> 00:11:36,817
Don't stay with me if you want to marry & want money

144
00:11:38,217 --> 00:11:39,808
Don't think that because you had abortion so secretly

145
00:11:40,017 --> 00:11:41,210
that I would feel sorry for all the rest of my life

146
00:11:41,418 --> 00:11:42,645
I won't!

147
00:11:42,818 --> 00:11:44,807
Your mouth said you won't but your heart said you will

148
00:11:46,184 --> 00:11:49,708
Because you didn't bother me, didn't care about me

149
00:11:49,851 --> 00:11:51,248
I spoiled your baby

150
00:11:51,718 --> 00:11:53,445
And I am going to tell everybody

151
00:11:53,651 --> 00:11:54,639
that I had your baby aborted,

152
00:11:54,785 --> 00:11:56,080
so that you'll feel guilty for the rest of your life

153
00:12:01,651 --> 00:12:04,481
You've got the guts!

154
00:12:45,184 --> 00:12:46,081
Cousin!

155
00:12:49,318 --> 00:12:50,341
Are you alright?

156
00:13:15,518 --> 00:13:16,381
Cousin!

157
00:13:19,585 --> 00:13:23,278
What's the matter, cousin?

158
00:13:24,685 --> 00:13:26,116
Are you lovelorned?

159
00:13:31,518 --> 00:13:32,745
What did you say?

160
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:38,272
What did you say?

161
00:13:47,384 --> 00:13:51,578
I tell you! Never talk about lovelorn again

162
00:13:52,451 --> 00:13:54,041
Or else, I'll throw you out!

163
00:15:08,984 --> 00:15:10,041
Did you see the doctor?

164
00:15:11,017 --> 00:15:12,381
I just returned from the hospital

165
00:15:14,684 --> 00:15:15,809
What have the doctor said?

166
00:15:16,784 --> 00:15:18,114
I will get the report tomorrow!

167
00:15:28,651 --> 00:15:31,446
Haven't you have your meal? Go eating with me!

168
00:15:32,951 --> 00:15:34,144
I have make the meal!

169
00:15:45,117 --> 00:15:46,810
Fly had phoned you again this morning

170
00:15:49,117 --> 00:15:50,242
What had the dirty guy said?

171
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:54,550
Nothing special! Just some casual talk!

172
00:15:56,051 --> 00:15:57,415
Didn't he ask anything about me?

173
00:15:58,017 --> 00:15:58,812
What kind of thing?

174
00:16:01,717 --> 00:16:03,240
The thing happened last night!

175
00:16:07,984 --> 00:16:09,541
Fly had asked only once!

176
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:14,980
What? What did he ask?

177
00:16:15,984 --> 00:16:17,416
I'm afraid to tell you!

178
00:16:19,451 --> 00:16:21,007
Just tell me what you heard!

179
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:23,180
Do you insist me to tell you?

180
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:27,040
He asked me if you were lovelorned

181
00:16:40,051 --> 00:16:43,313
You have been here for all day! What didn't you go out?

182
00:16:44,917 --> 00:16:49,111
No place to go! I have no friend in Kowloon

183
00:16:54,251 --> 00:16:57,411
Eat quickly! We'll go out together tonight

184
00:17:09,917 --> 00:17:11,349
Cousin, are you studying or working?

185
00:17:12,551 --> 00:17:13,811
I'm working already!

186
00:17:14,518 --> 00:17:15,541
What kind of job?

187
00:17:16,451 --> 00:17:18,314
I'm working in a friend's restaurant

188
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:20,977
Boy friend?

189
00:17:24,284 --> 00:17:25,977
Well! Not quite!

190
00:17:26,418 --> 00:17:27,906
Everybody call him Uncle Tang

191
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:34,582
Let us go to the cinema a while later!

192
00:17:34,684 --> 00:17:37,480
We'll go if you are free! You have no need to stay with me

193
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:06,914
Calling rescue?

194
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,907
Ah-site, how much have you lose?

195
00:18:11,717 --> 00:18:12,910
Five hundreds!

196
00:18:15,951 --> 00:18:18,213
I won't play for so little money!

197
00:18:19,284 --> 00:18:23,875
One thousand for one game, agree for not?

198
00:18:25,451 --> 00:18:27,973
One thousand? What's your opinion, King of snooker?

199
00:18:28,684 --> 00:18:31,844
What? To see my quality just by one thousand dollar?

200
00:18:32,017 --> 00:18:33,415
I play with single-hand in this game,

201
00:18:33,584 --> 00:18:35,050
for two thousands

202
00:18:35,418 --> 00:18:38,384
Single hand! Let's sign contract at once!

203
00:18:40,617 --> 00:18:41,514
Ah-site!

204
00:18:44,284 --> 00:18:45,181
Single-head!

205
00:19:01,117 --> 00:19:02,844
Another ball into pocket! What's your opinion?

206
00:19:14,951 --> 00:19:17,678
Right, King of snooker is really great!

207
00:19:25,084 --> 00:19:27,982
Ah-site, how many scores have I lost?

208
00:19:31,151 --> 00:19:34,208
No need to calculate! He has thirty scores more than you

209
00:19:34,351 --> 00:19:36,374
Still has five scores more than you even if you win all the ball rested

210
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,043
How do you look?

211
00:19:39,684 --> 00:19:41,513
That means we need a targeting stick!

212
00:19:43,151 --> 00:19:45,844
Ah-site, bring me my private cue

213
00:19:58,117 --> 00:19:59,378
Start, start!

214
00:20:01,217 --> 00:20:02,978
Stunt Follow

215
00:20:03,951 --> 00:20:05,644
Get away!

216
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,383
Get out of my way!

217
00:20:12,051 --> 00:20:17,074
Now, set the targeting stick!

218
00:20:22,251 --> 00:20:25,478
Not stable! Make it more stable!

219
00:20:26,584 --> 00:20:30,278
Beware! You will lost 7 scores!

220
00:20:30,417 --> 00:20:36,214
Save that balls! Save it!

221
00:20:36,584 --> 00:20:37,515
Are you taking me as a dead!

222
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:40,445
Fuck off!

223
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:42,874
Big Brother!

224
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:45,011
What's the matter, Big Brother?

225
00:20:45,084 --> 00:20:45,913
Get away!

226
00:21:10,784 --> 00:21:11,943
Go away, bastard!

227
00:21:13,184 --> 00:21:14,479
Don't go!

228
00:21:15,151 --> 00:21:16,343
Don't go!

229
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:25,815
Bastard, don't block the way!

230
00:21:31,417 --> 00:21:32,440
Damn you!

231
00:21:46,984 --> 00:21:49,472
Damn it! Damn it!

232
00:22:04,317 --> 00:22:05,840
Fuck off

233
00:22:26,951 --> 00:22:30,145
Big Brother!

234
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:54,581
Could we leave now?

235
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,012
It's OK!

236
00:23:23,717 --> 00:23:24,910
Be quiet, would you?

237
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:41,443
Are you alright?

238
00:26:42,317 --> 00:26:43,374
I'm alright!

239
00:26:58,083 --> 00:26:59,674
Why don't you go to sleep? It's so late

240
00:27:41,083 --> 00:27:43,549
Cousin, my report said that

241
00:27:43,784 --> 00:27:45,409
my health is alright

242
00:27:45,684 --> 00:27:47,945
I want to celebrate with you at first,

243
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,572
but, Auntie said the weather is fine

244
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,545
& the restaurant is busy these days

245
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,716
Uncle Tang want me to go back earlier

246
00:27:53,983 --> 00:27:56,882
I have called you twice, but you have no response

247
00:27:57,083 --> 00:27:58,811
You must be very tired, I think

248
00:27:59,116 --> 00:28:00,446
Summer is coming

249
00:28:00,684 --> 00:28:02,843
& many people will spend their holiday in Lantau Island

250
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:05,515
Do you have holiday working in such career?

251
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:08,512
I've made a meal for you in the kitchen

252
00:28:08,983 --> 00:28:11,108
Besides, I've bought several glasses

253
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:14,172
I know, they will be all broken sooner or later

254
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:16,043
So I've hid one of them

255
00:28:16,216 --> 00:28:18,239
One day when you need this glass,

256
00:28:18,417 --> 00:28:19,474
give me a phone, and...

257
00:28:19,684 --> 00:28:21,911
I'll tell you where it was hidden

258
00:28:22,016 --> 00:28:23,312
Goodbye, Ah-ngor!

259
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:01,775
Everybody!

260
00:29:04,517 --> 00:29:07,779
Be quiet! Be quiet!

261
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:17,141
All my relatives and all my guests,

262
00:29:17,483 --> 00:29:20,347
today is the wedding of my brother, Ah-site

263
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:23,181
We've prepared some simple food to serve you

264
00:29:23,317 --> 00:29:25,545
Would we all raise our glasses I drink first

265
00:29:25,717 --> 00:29:28,046
Cheer!

266
00:29:29,817 --> 00:29:32,009
I've already said that two hundred dollars were too much

267
00:29:32,183 --> 00:29:33,171
How would I know he would

268
00:29:33,417 --> 00:29:34,383
hold the ceremony on the roof!

269
00:29:35,016 --> 00:29:36,004
Please eat!

270
00:29:36,717 --> 00:29:38,342
Use your meal, please!

271
00:29:43,717 --> 00:29:46,012
Don't behave this way! Eat!

272
00:29:46,483 --> 00:29:47,380
Look at this way!

273
00:29:48,883 --> 00:29:50,474
Take one more photograph!

274
00:29:51,483 --> 00:29:52,346
OK! OK!

275
00:29:52,483 --> 00:29:53,312
Thank you!

276
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:55,781
Go bring your mother-in-law and father-in-law to take a photograph!

277
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:57,311
Hurry up!

278
00:30:03,916 --> 00:30:05,473
Father, would you take a photograph!

279
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:06,981
No!

280
00:30:07,183 --> 00:30:08,046
Take it, father!

281
00:30:08,116 --> 00:30:08,911
No!

282
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:14,373
Don't be like that, go take a photograph!

283
00:30:14,617 --> 00:30:18,208
No! What for? It's really a shame!

284
00:30:19,183 --> 00:30:20,547
Eat quickly if you want to!

285
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:22,377
We must leave soon or else I'll faint

286
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:24,345
Don't be like that, father!

287
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:26,947
Don't hold any celebration if you don't have money

288
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:29,742
Celebrating on the roof is extremely unbelievable

289
00:30:36,016 --> 00:30:37,607
I just don't know how to teach you

290
00:30:38,083 --> 00:30:40,878
You have never done a good work in the past

291
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:43,673
It's your brother's wedding!

292
00:30:43,816 --> 00:30:45,214
Why did you made it so shabby?

293
00:30:45,849 --> 00:30:48,338
Don't you think that I didn't want to make it luxurious?

294
00:30:48,517 --> 00:30:50,676
But I have no money! What can I do?

295
00:30:54,584 --> 00:30:56,049
Damn it! So noisy!

296
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:12,516
Gay fellow!

297
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:14,742
What did you say?

298
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:19,243
What did I say? I said you are gay!

299
00:31:19,417 --> 00:31:21,474
I did serve you shark's fin or abalone, didn't you?

300
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:24,446
It has no air-conditioning! Why are you so talkative?

301
00:31:24,617 --> 00:31:28,413
You only deserved vegetal abalone

302
00:31:28,684 --> 00:31:30,240
If your son-in-law didn't say you love eating abalone,

303
00:31:30,383 --> 00:31:31,474
I won't let you have it!

304
00:31:31,749 --> 00:31:33,806
If I know you are so troublesome,

305
00:31:34,083 --> 00:31:36,708
I'll give you shit, not abalone!

306
00:31:37,517 --> 00:31:38,743
Are you looking for death?

307
00:31:38,916 --> 00:31:40,041
Don't you dare throwing things to me?

308
00:31:40,183 --> 00:31:42,012
Don't block my way! Let me kill him

309
00:31:42,183 --> 00:31:43,171
Don't you want to fight?

310
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,872
Don't do that, Big Brother!

311
00:31:45,116 --> 00:31:46,945
Want to fight, don't you?

312
00:31:47,116 --> 00:31:49,412
Hey, now what do you want? Get away!

313
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:52,272
I tell you, don't make any noise!

314
00:31:52,617 --> 00:31:52,980
What can't I speak?

315
00:31:53,116 --> 00:31:53,548
Sit down!

316
00:31:54,183 --> 00:31:55,206
Get lost!

317
00:31:55,383 --> 00:31:55,814
Good boy!

318
00:31:55,983 --> 00:31:57,744
Sit, sit down!

319
00:31:58,483 --> 00:32:01,971
Hey! Is it right? He's really bastard

320
00:32:02,116 --> 00:32:03,377
Do you really want to fight before Big Brother?

321
00:32:03,517 --> 00:32:04,380
Don't you?

322
00:32:04,617 --> 00:32:07,242
Speak up! Speak once more!

323
00:32:11,617 --> 00:32:13,673
Anyway, he is Ah-site's father-in-law

324
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:16,943
If you make trouble, your young brother will be embarrassed

325
00:32:17,183 --> 00:32:17,807
Do you agree?

326
00:32:18,016 --> 00:32:22,472
OK! It's my fault! I'm wrong!

327
00:32:28,649 --> 00:32:34,583
My young brother, I make you suffered today

328
00:32:35,916 --> 00:32:41,678
I'll pay for it when I have money some days

329
00:32:55,749 --> 00:32:58,079
I knew that it's our turn

330
00:32:58,216 --> 00:32:59,772
But it happens so soon

331
00:33:00,016 --> 00:33:02,107
The cops arrested us last night.

332
00:33:02,317 --> 00:33:04,476
They're just small fry, It's not a big deal

333
00:33:04,616 --> 00:33:06,809
Big-mouth kay controls the money

334
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:16,314
They said that

335
00:33:16,483 --> 00:33:21,142
The cops are making a deal with him. They wont him to be turncoat witness

336
00:33:21,417 --> 00:33:24,247
This case is quite serious!

337
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:26,711
So that Godfather sent me to inform you that,

338
00:33:26,883 --> 00:33:30,316
don't make any trouble if it is not necessarily these days

339
00:33:32,849 --> 00:33:34,838
Hey, the police has a great action outside!

340
00:33:34,983 --> 00:33:35,574
All of you bastards

341
00:33:35,749 --> 00:33:37,010
who have drugs and weapons,

342
00:33:37,283 --> 00:33:39,249
go hide them away quickly!

343
00:33:41,083 --> 00:33:43,072
Ah-wah, someone visiting you outside!

344
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:44,111
Thank you!

345
00:33:50,783 --> 00:33:51,680
What are you coming for?

346
00:33:51,849 --> 00:33:52,906
I visit you with special reason

347
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:55,207
Your brother, Fly, owe us a sum of money

348
00:33:55,417 --> 00:33:58,542
He hasn't pay the debt for several period and didn't reply our call

349
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:01,307
My big brother sent me to inform you that...

350
00:34:01,616 --> 00:34:03,582
If he don't show up tomorrow,

351
00:34:03,749 --> 00:34:05,545
we won't give him any chance

352
00:34:06,683 --> 00:34:10,581
Tell Tony that I know how to teach my own man,

353
00:34:10,849 --> 00:34:13,077
and, about the debt, I will ask Fly

354
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:14,011
If it's true,

355
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,775
I will bring him to see Tony tomorrow

356
00:34:25,816 --> 00:34:27,941
Do you want to see me?

357
00:34:33,816 --> 00:34:35,305
You need money don't you?

358
00:34:37,083 --> 00:34:40,742
I always need money

359
00:34:41,283 --> 00:34:46,874
I'm used to it. I have big prospects

360
00:34:47,749 --> 00:34:50,715
The fortune teller told me I'll be freat at the age of 30

361
00:34:51,016 --> 00:34:55,346
Every thing is finethen

362
00:34:55,516 --> 00:34:57,278
No need to stay here

363
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:02,943
Did he told you that you can't live to 30

364
00:35:03,083 --> 00:35:04,571
No!

365
00:35:05,216 --> 00:35:08,046
I heard that you borrowed money from Tony

366
00:35:08,216 --> 00:35:09,079
Who is Tony?
Who is Tony?

367
00:35:09,283 --> 00:35:10,509
I don't know him.
I don't know him.

368
00:35:12,183 --> 00:35:13,648
What did you say?

369
00:35:14,116 --> 00:35:15,412
English

370
00:35:15,516 --> 00:35:17,982
You knew that I don't know English

371
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:22,542
I ask you. Did you borrow money from Tony?

372
00:35:22,716 --> 00:35:23,909
No!

373
00:35:25,216 --> 00:35:27,943
No? Why are they looking for you?

374
00:35:28,183 --> 00:35:29,944
They are eating around the corner

375
00:35:30,183 --> 00:35:31,376
Do you want me to tell them you're here?

376
00:35:31,549 --> 00:35:32,537
Yes!

377
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:40,938
Who are you winking to?

378
00:35:42,283 --> 00:35:46,181
How much did you borrow?

379
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:49,407
Just a small sum. Take it easy

380
00:35:49,583 --> 00:35:50,981
Small sum is also money

381
00:35:51,216 --> 00:35:52,341
How much?

382
00:35:52,849 --> 00:35:56,077
Hundreds bucks. It's not a big deal, leave him alone

383
00:35:56,449 --> 00:35:58,915
But they come to me

384
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:02,346
Tell me

385
00:36:07,616 --> 00:36:11,413
4 meals and a pair of gold bracelets

386
00:36:27,883 --> 00:36:28,849
Here are eight thousands!

387
00:36:32,783 --> 00:36:38,148
What? Eight thousands? Are you using one dollar as two?

388
00:36:40,516 --> 00:36:42,176
It's so if he said it is!

389
00:36:43,317 --> 00:36:46,283
The principal is eight thousands! What about the rest?

390
00:36:46,749 --> 00:36:49,045
He haven't paid for four instalments

391
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:53,210
Omitting the odd, he still owe us thirteen thousand and five

392
00:36:53,383 --> 00:36:54,507
We are giving you benefit because we know you

393
00:36:54,616 --> 00:36:55,639
Why don't you go robbing?

394
00:36:59,883 --> 00:37:02,111
Who do you think you are? Speak to me?

395
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:03,476
So fond of talking

396
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:06,139
Ah-kwong, talk to him for several hours at there!

397
00:37:06,283 --> 00:37:06,611
Yes!

398
00:37:06,783 --> 00:37:07,510
Fuck off, you son of bitch!

399
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:10,513
Shut up! Get out!

400
00:37:12,716 --> 00:37:13,739
Get out!

401
00:37:25,216 --> 00:37:27,909
Your brother is lucky in working under you

402
00:37:28,816 --> 00:37:30,679
If he is working for other, he have already died!

403
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:36,181
Don't talk anymore I don't want to talk about that

404
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:41,481
I return you the principal first

405
00:37:41,749 --> 00:37:44,340
But he really didn't have money to paid the interest

406
00:37:44,482 --> 00:37:45,413
So we have to delay for two instalments more

407
00:37:46,349 --> 00:37:47,440
Two instalments delay?

408
00:37:47,583 --> 00:37:49,742
Why not return to me after my death?

409
00:37:51,317 --> 00:37:52,714
You must trust me even if you don't trust him!

410
00:37:52,816 --> 00:37:54,248
I'll responsible for this debt

411
00:37:55,983 --> 00:37:57,313
But I have no money now

412
00:37:57,649 --> 00:37:59,615
I'll give you after two days

413
00:38:02,116 --> 00:38:05,445
How can you be a Big Brother if you don't have any money at hand

414
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:07,310
I think you better go farming!

415
00:38:07,583 --> 00:38:11,175
I thought that you had money so I dared to talk with you

416
00:38:11,649 --> 00:38:14,581
You are such a poor Big Brother...

417
00:38:20,983 --> 00:38:23,949
Did you really want it?

418
00:38:25,549 --> 00:38:26,640
What's the matter?

419
00:38:26,916 --> 00:38:28,575
What? You are crazy!

420
00:38:29,316 --> 00:38:31,339
I have the gut to take it if you have it now

421
00:38:34,749 --> 00:38:36,238
OK! I dial a phone first

422
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:48,709
Why are you standing here still?

423
00:38:49,216 --> 00:38:51,545
Your boss told you to talk with me, why didn't you speak?

424
00:38:51,716 --> 00:38:52,511
What's your father name?

425
00:38:52,683 --> 00:38:53,546
What's your mother called?

426
00:38:53,683 --> 00:38:54,706
Stop joking, Fly!

427
00:38:55,516 --> 00:38:56,539
Why didn't you speak?

428
00:38:56,683 --> 00:38:57,910
You don't have parents?

429
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:06,107
Aren't you the boss?

430
00:39:09,583 --> 00:39:10,549
Don't come near to me

431
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:13,672
I have some problem now, can you lend me some money?

432
00:39:13,816 --> 00:39:14,509
Could you?

433
00:39:14,916 --> 00:39:15,540
Yes, I could!

434
00:39:15,683 --> 00:39:16,172
Really?

435
00:39:16,316 --> 00:39:17,180
Really! No problem!

436
00:39:17,316 --> 00:39:18,078
Fly!

437
00:39:21,249 --> 00:39:23,374
Now I borrow these money from your boss

438
00:39:23,683 --> 00:39:25,273
It's up to you, take it or not!

439
00:39:25,549 --> 00:39:27,777
But, there's no debt between us from now on

440
00:39:28,249 --> 00:39:30,340
I tell you, if I become rich in the future

441
00:39:30,516 --> 00:39:32,005
I will paid back to you

442
00:39:32,183 --> 00:39:32,910
Today, you are wrong in helping outsider

443
00:39:33,116 --> 00:39:34,445
to beat your own people

444
00:39:34,616 --> 00:39:35,582
Is it right?

445
00:39:36,683 --> 00:39:38,706
What are you waiting for? Take the money to Tony!

446
00:39:38,883 --> 00:39:39,814
Cancel each other!

447
00:39:43,215 --> 00:39:46,080
This is given you as bonus!

448
00:39:51,649 --> 00:39:54,706
You are really something! Playing trick in my place

449
00:39:57,249 --> 00:39:59,477
You are also great! You've make fun of me!

450
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:01,381
Wait a moment

451
00:40:02,416 --> 00:40:03,279
Get away!

452
00:40:12,816 --> 00:40:16,248
Tony, I'm employing you to guard this place,

453
00:40:16,416 --> 00:40:19,178
instead of inviting robber to rob me

454
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:20,839
What do you mean by that?

455
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:23,379
Boss, he is just losing temper!

456
00:40:39,883 --> 00:40:41,610
The situation is bad now,

457
00:40:42,016 --> 00:40:44,005
but you two still fighting each other

458
00:40:44,215 --> 00:40:45,875
Are you treating me as a dead?

459
00:40:46,849 --> 00:40:51,679
It's him who done wrong first Borrowed my money

460
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:54,441
causing trouble in my place, and robbing my boss

461
00:40:54,983 --> 00:40:57,972
He was wrong in the whole situation, Godfather!

462
00:40:58,416 --> 00:41:01,473
You know he is crazy already, so don't bother him

463
00:41:02,482 --> 00:41:05,676
And you are doing too much, taking advantage from him

464
00:41:07,316 --> 00:41:09,646
You must know that he was guarding that place!

465
00:41:10,683 --> 00:41:13,877
Godfather, I'm giving back!

466
00:41:14,316 --> 00:41:16,612
He want the money back, so I paid the debt

467
00:41:16,749 --> 00:41:18,010
We've made an equal exchange!

468
00:41:18,282 --> 00:41:19,213
Equal?

469
00:41:20,016 --> 00:41:21,174
What are you doing?

470
00:41:21,549 --> 00:41:23,777
I'm the one who make decision till I die

471
00:41:24,349 --> 00:41:25,212
So troublesome!

472
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:28,282
Now I tell you two, you paid the instalments every month

473
00:41:28,449 --> 00:41:31,472
And the event is settled in this way Make a vow!

474
00:41:35,316 --> 00:41:38,180
What are you two doing? I told you two to make agreement!

475
00:41:38,349 --> 00:41:41,543
Have a hand-shake? Shake

476
00:41:47,416 --> 00:41:50,177
Ah-kay, the traitor, is a witness for the police

477
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:52,815
We cannot let this guy survived

478
00:41:53,349 --> 00:41:55,611
Kill him before he go to court

479
00:41:55,816 --> 00:41:57,111
What's your opinion?

480
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:01,114
The task is difficult! Which one should we send?

481
00:42:01,616 --> 00:42:04,138
I don't want outsider to take this case

482
00:42:04,349 --> 00:42:05,406
Let's make it this way

483
00:42:05,583 --> 00:42:08,378
You two, find some smart boys

484
00:42:08,749 --> 00:42:10,647
to draw dead lots two days later

485
00:42:12,382 --> 00:42:17,110
He's the one, brave, and haughty

486
00:42:17,449 --> 00:42:19,415
Send your younger brother if he wish to do it

487
00:42:19,649 --> 00:42:22,206
I'll let him go! I'll let him not paying my debt

488
00:42:22,349 --> 00:42:23,747
His family can have subsidize if he fail

489
00:42:24,115 --> 00:42:25,240
Do you have the guts?

490
00:42:25,349 --> 00:42:27,645
What? What did you say? Frightening me?

491
00:42:28,182 --> 00:42:29,273
Shut up!

492
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,511
Don't making fun of the followers

493
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:35,046
You and me are the bravest

494
00:42:35,616 --> 00:42:37,775
It's either you or me to take this case

495
00:42:38,082 --> 00:42:42,139
I'll do it if you don't, say it and I'll take it!

496
00:42:44,182 --> 00:42:47,444
You'll do if you don't speak up

497
00:42:47,749 --> 00:42:51,943
Say you don't and admit that you are a coward. And I'll take the case

498
00:42:52,449 --> 00:42:53,779
Wake up!

499
00:42:54,783 --> 00:42:56,772
Now you two are pushing me together?

500
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:59,074
OK! I kill you two first and then I'll kill him

501
00:42:59,683 --> 00:43:01,706
Not again! Stop quarrelling!

502
00:43:02,215 --> 00:43:04,147
I have my plan in handling this case

503
00:43:04,282 --> 00:43:05,407
All of you go out first

504
00:43:06,049 --> 00:43:08,015
I leave now, Godfather!

505
00:43:08,482 --> 00:43:09,675
I leave now, Godfather!

506
00:43:10,182 --> 00:43:11,705
Ah-wah, come back!

507
00:43:14,916 --> 00:43:18,313
I know that you and your brother are good friends

508
00:43:18,616 --> 00:43:22,241
But he is too crazy. Teach him...

509
00:43:22,416 --> 00:43:24,439
or he will like a time-bomb beside you

510
00:43:24,649 --> 00:43:26,046
and some day he will cause you deadly trouble

511
00:43:26,382 --> 00:43:30,041
I know, I have think of it

512
00:43:30,249 --> 00:43:32,408
I want to find him a job

513
00:43:32,716 --> 00:43:33,511
It's good to do it!

514
00:43:34,049 --> 00:43:37,140
Fishballs...

515
00:43:40,516 --> 00:43:42,311

516
00:43:43,583 --> 00:43:45,071

What?

522
00:44:07,916 --> 00:44:10,473
Do you mean I can't do small business?

523
00:44:11,516 --> 00:44:13,311
Do you know who I am?

524
00:44:15,082 --> 00:44:20,037
You'll develop into big business

525
00:44:20,182 --> 00:44:22,876
Yeah, I sell fishballs here today

526
00:44:23,649 --> 00:44:25,615
Someday I'll sell bounbs in Middle East

527
00:44:25,783 --> 00:44:27,715
Bull shit Police is coming

528
00:44:30,982 --> 00:44:32,812
Wait a minute...

529
00:44:32,982 --> 00:44:34,573
Police is coming

530
00:44:34,949 --> 00:44:36,643
What the hell!

531
00:44:36,816 --> 00:44:38,873
Does this cart belong to you. Fishball man

532
00:44:39,015 --> 00:44:40,845
What's your name? Fishball man

533
00:44:41,049 --> 00:44:41,946
What?

534
00:44:42,082 --> 00:44:42,810
If you don't sell fishballs

535
00:44:43,015 --> 00:44:44,538
You stand here with scissors?

536
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:46,341
How come so you're Fishball man

537
00:44:46,516 --> 00:44:49,482
I'm just cutting my vibrissae

538
00:44:50,382 --> 00:44:51,905
So it's not your cart. Take it away

539
00:44:52,082 --> 00:44:54,605
Take it

540
00:44:54,783 --> 00:44:56,874
Hey! What are you doing?

541
00:44:57,049 --> 00:44:58,242
The cart and the fishballs are bought by money

542
00:44:58,416 --> 00:44:59,938
Money doesn't matter. But pride matters

543
00:45:00,115 --> 00:45:02,877
I'm not famous. But people know me

544
00:45:03,049 --> 00:45:04,845
I don't want to sell fishballs

545
00:45:05,049 --> 00:45:06,140
I Want to hang around

546
00:45:08,915 --> 00:45:12,040
Get lost, get away

547
00:45:13,282 --> 00:45:15,578
I want you to have a job

548
00:45:15,915 --> 00:45:17,279
I don't like selling fishballs

549
00:45:17,516 --> 00:45:19,209
What do you like to sell?

550
00:45:19,516 --> 00:45:20,573
You can't do anything

551
00:45:20,716 --> 00:45:22,011
Just hang around

552
00:45:22,316 --> 00:45:23,873
You are not anything

553
00:45:24,015 --> 00:45:25,777
Yeah, I'm not anything

554
00:45:25,949 --> 00:45:27,279
I can only sell fishballs

555
00:45:28,549 --> 00:45:30,447
You ask me to do that

556
00:45:31,149 --> 00:45:32,274
If I can't stand anymore

557
00:45:32,449 --> 00:45:34,347
I'll put poison on the fishballs

558
00:45:38,215 --> 00:45:39,613
It's good for you. Do you understand?

559
00:45:57,549 --> 00:46:01,709
Hi, what a coincident!

560
00:46:01,949 --> 00:46:03,381
Right! Really a coincident!

561
00:46:07,015 --> 00:46:07,981
How are you?

562
00:46:09,149 --> 00:46:17,480
Fine! I have married!

563
00:46:24,783 --> 00:46:28,772
Good! Are your husband treating you good?

564
00:46:29,649 --> 00:46:30,807
Quite good!

565
00:46:36,382 --> 00:46:38,541
So heavy is the rain! Who knows hot long will I have to wait!

566
00:46:39,382 --> 00:46:41,348
I'm waiting for my husband!

567
00:46:44,416 --> 00:46:45,677
Have a cigarette?

568
00:46:46,149 --> 00:46:47,410
I didn't smoke anymore!

569
00:47:01,015 --> 00:47:02,379
It's not yours

570
00:47:06,815 --> 00:47:07,747
I leave now!

571
00:47:16,282 --> 00:47:17,145
Goodbye!

572
00:47:27,449 --> 00:47:28,710
Is Ah-ngor here?

573
00:47:28,882 --> 00:47:30,905
She is not here. Who are you?

574
00:47:32,716 --> 00:47:34,739
It's alright. Thanks

575
00:49:09,516 --> 00:49:10,174
Lady!

576
00:49:10,549 --> 00:49:11,446
What's the matter?

577
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:12,671
Is Ah-ngor here?

578
00:49:12,882 --> 00:49:15,280
I'm not sure! She had went to Kowloon and still haven't returned

579
00:49:16,382 --> 00:49:16,745
To Kowloon?

580
00:49:16,782 --> 00:49:17,713
Yes!

581
00:49:20,449 --> 00:49:21,176
Thank you

582
00:49:21,282 --> 00:49:22,213
You're welcome

583
00:50:14,316 --> 00:50:15,441
When did you arrive?

584
00:50:17,316 --> 00:50:18,475
I just arrived

585
00:50:24,082 --> 00:50:25,446
You look a bit fatter than before

586
00:50:28,648 --> 00:50:29,671
A little bit

587
00:50:30,516 --> 00:50:31,708
So are you

588
00:50:33,149 --> 00:50:36,172
It's all because of him He's my doctor

589
00:50:42,149 --> 00:50:43,547
Would you stay up here tonight?

590
00:50:44,782 --> 00:50:47,942
No... I'm going home now

591
00:50:56,682 --> 00:50:57,410
Ah-ngor!

592
00:51:00,815 --> 00:51:05,043
I just wanted to you tell that I've found that glass

593
00:52:02,481 --> 00:52:03,448
Miss Cheung called you just now

594
00:52:03,615 --> 00:52:04,911
She said that she was going to the pier of Silver-mine Bay

595
00:52:05,115 --> 00:52:06,637
and told you to wait for her anyway

596
00:54:11,548 --> 00:54:12,707
You may go to sleep

597
00:54:12,882 --> 00:54:14,370
& I'll check in for you tomorrow

598
00:54:15,815 --> 00:54:16,712
OK!

599
00:54:35,982 --> 00:54:37,278
When do you go to work next morning?

600
00:54:37,682 --> 00:54:41,478
Very early! I'll make breakfast for you

601
00:54:42,648 --> 00:54:43,636
Good!

602
00:54:48,348 --> 00:54:49,939
How long will you live in here?

603
00:54:51,848 --> 00:54:52,973
It depends!

604
00:55:10,282 --> 00:55:11,611
I leave now

605
00:55:13,982 --> 00:55:15,107
I see you off

606
00:55:15,415 --> 00:55:17,381
That's OK! It's near

607
00:55:19,648 --> 00:55:21,307
Would you not go home tonight?

608
00:55:25,182 --> 00:55:26,704
Why do you not visit me until now?

609
00:55:31,281 --> 00:55:33,214
Because, I know myself clearly

610
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:36,475
I cannot promise you anything

611
00:55:39,848 --> 00:55:46,474
If I'm not missing you, I won't visit you today

612
00:55:49,015 --> 00:55:51,038
If you don't visit me in these days

613
00:55:51,381 --> 00:55:53,211
I will probably marry that doctor

614
00:56:58,049 --> 00:57:01,276
Fish-ball guy, give me one dollar of fish-ball with more dressing

615
00:57:08,848 --> 00:57:13,076
Take it, why don't you take it? You've said you want more dressing!

616
00:57:13,448 --> 00:57:16,573
Take it or I'll get mad

617
00:57:20,348 --> 00:57:23,439
Fish-ball guy? Damn you!

618
00:57:25,049 --> 00:57:29,242
It won't, Mr Fly! Why are you so poor?

619
00:57:29,448 --> 00:57:30,971
You don't have to sell fish-ball, do you?

620
00:57:31,548 --> 00:57:34,571
Poor guy

621
00:57:35,481 --> 00:57:37,344
It must be your Big Brother who told you to do so

622
00:57:38,214 --> 00:57:40,339
You should leave your Big Brother

623
00:57:40,448 --> 00:57:43,937
Look at my followers, all dressed up!

624
00:57:44,082 --> 00:57:45,980
Taking wireless telephone, do you need that?

625
00:57:46,515 --> 00:57:48,640
You bastard! Your Big Brother sent you

626
00:57:48,815 --> 00:57:50,178
selling fish-ball in the street

627
00:57:50,381 --> 00:57:51,904
Working for me is better!

628
00:57:52,148 --> 00:57:53,444
Escape

629
00:57:57,648 --> 00:57:59,773
Escape for what? You are a gangster!

630
00:57:59,915 --> 00:58:01,278
We have so crowd of gangsters here! It's no need to afraid!

631
00:58:01,448 --> 00:58:02,243
Beat him!

632
00:58:04,748 --> 00:58:07,441
Don't be afraid! You'll be alright even if you're in jail

633
00:58:07,582 --> 00:58:08,878
Fight back at one if someone beat you

634
00:58:09,015 --> 00:58:10,106
Don't make us lose faces

635
00:58:10,715 --> 00:58:12,340
You bastard, you...

636
00:58:12,515 --> 00:58:14,743
Take it easy! It's OK!

637
00:58:14,882 --> 00:58:17,245
You are not selling drugs, just fish-ball

638
00:58:18,348 --> 00:58:19,109
Something good to be seen

639
00:58:53,448 --> 00:58:54,345
Beat him!

640
00:59:07,782 --> 00:59:10,270
Hey, don't go you bastard

641
00:59:11,015 --> 00:59:12,241
Don't go!

642
00:59:13,848 --> 00:59:14,973
Go to hell, bastard!

643
00:59:30,848 --> 00:59:32,814
Take him here

644
00:59:42,415 --> 00:59:43,711
Finished drinking

645
00:59:46,582 --> 00:59:48,514
Right! How many chicken wings are there in two boxes

646
00:59:49,949 --> 00:59:51,539
About two or three hundreds!

647
00:59:52,915 --> 00:59:54,540
Two or three hundreds?

648
00:59:59,548 --> 01:00:01,912
Hey, go back and tell your boss...

649
01:00:02,048 --> 01:00:06,276
not to send you to take thing

650
01:00:06,515 --> 01:00:07,811
so heavy alone

651
01:00:07,949 --> 01:00:11,073
Or else, I'll give him one fist for one wing in return

652
01:00:12,014 --> 01:00:12,946
You are crazy

653
01:00:13,081 --> 01:00:14,069
I am crazy?

654
01:00:17,348 --> 01:00:19,075
Do you want me to help you?

655
01:00:19,248 --> 01:00:21,737
It's OK! Anyway, I will quit!

656
01:00:22,081 --> 01:00:26,673
Quit! Why?

657
01:00:28,315 --> 01:00:30,338
I want to find a job in Kowloon

658
01:00:32,248 --> 01:00:34,874
Good! It's doing me favour! You can live in my house!

659
01:00:36,715 --> 01:00:38,305
Don't say the second time

660
01:00:39,081 --> 01:00:40,638
You can't deny it if you say it twice

661
01:00:42,381 --> 01:00:44,040
I'm not kidding!

662
01:00:45,248 --> 01:00:47,009
I go out and will never come back

663
01:00:58,548 --> 01:00:59,979
Hey, what do you want to eat?

664
01:01:09,181 --> 01:01:11,670
Tell him that I'll go to find him on time

665
01:01:12,181 --> 01:01:14,204
If Fly has anything wrong, he'll pay for it

666
01:01:14,448 --> 01:01:15,277
It's finished!

667
01:01:16,981 --> 01:01:18,004
What's the matter?

668
01:01:18,648 --> 01:01:21,045
Nothing special! Fly has some problem and I'm going out now

669
01:01:21,248 --> 01:01:22,407
Would it be dangerous?

670
01:01:22,615 --> 01:01:25,809
No, it'll be alright, I'll be back tonight

671
01:02:35,481 --> 01:02:37,413
Uncle Kwan, so many people here?

672
01:02:37,582 --> 01:02:40,548
Ah-wah, it's Fly doing wrong in this case

673
01:02:40,748 --> 01:02:44,009
But, I don't want to make it big since we all know each other

674
01:02:44,481 --> 01:02:47,276
Say something good to Tony & the case will be settled

675
01:02:57,415 --> 01:03:00,847
Tony, no matter what did Fly do,

676
01:03:00,981 --> 01:03:02,413
I'll punish him according to my rules

677
01:03:03,081 --> 01:03:04,513
So please give me back my brother

678
01:03:04,682 --> 01:03:08,079
Brother? What kind of brother?

679
01:03:08,248 --> 01:03:11,078
Is this a brother? You like to protect your brother

680
01:03:11,248 --> 01:03:13,180
now you are protecting him!

681
01:03:13,847 --> 01:03:17,644
Making fun of me? You should protect him if he is good

682
01:03:17,814 --> 01:03:20,781
Now you are just protecting a lump of shit How can you be a Big Brother?

683
01:03:20,948 --> 01:03:22,914
Tony, stop when you have some advantage

684
01:03:23,081 --> 01:03:23,910
Don't go too far

685
01:03:24,081 --> 01:03:27,479
Uncle Kwan, save it for yourself! I'm teaching him to grow up

686
01:03:28,248 --> 01:03:30,441
His gangster can treat me like this

687
01:03:31,014 --> 01:03:32,980
Where can we stand in the future then?

688
01:03:33,782 --> 01:03:36,304
I'll release him surely!

689
01:03:36,548 --> 01:03:39,446
But I must be satisfied My requirement is low

690
01:03:39,615 --> 01:03:41,308
Just say one sentence I like

691
01:03:41,515 --> 01:03:42,742
I'll release him

692
01:03:48,548 --> 01:03:50,104
Do you like to hear these words

693
01:03:50,148 --> 01:03:51,205
Do you want your brother?

694
01:03:51,348 --> 01:03:52,211
Ah-wah!

695
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:13,870
Big Brother

696
01:04:19,214 --> 01:04:20,407
Are you alright?

697
01:04:23,348 --> 01:04:24,405
Can you walk?

698
01:04:26,448 --> 01:04:27,641
Yes, I can

699
01:04:37,682 --> 01:04:40,170
Tell your follower to help him stand

700
01:04:40,648 --> 01:04:41,636
Help him stand

701
01:04:43,281 --> 01:04:46,611
No, I can stand by myself

702
01:05:15,914 --> 01:05:17,403
I can walk by myself

703
01:05:30,114 --> 01:05:31,171
Don't get near to me

704
01:05:33,348 --> 01:05:34,211
Big Brother! Big Brother!

705
01:05:43,747 --> 01:05:44,838
I tell you two,

706
01:05:44,981 --> 01:05:46,947
this case can't be settled even if you bring the highest King

707
01:06:00,181 --> 01:06:04,943
Fly, this case certainly won't end up this way

708
01:06:05,114 --> 01:06:06,102
You take this money

709
01:06:06,415 --> 01:06:08,937
And go back to Til-gang Lin and wait for the case to fade out

710
01:06:09,114 --> 01:06:10,137
I won't go!

711
01:06:10,847 --> 01:06:11,438
I've made a vow

712
01:06:11,647 --> 01:06:13,943
I won't go back to see my mother if I do not succeed

713
01:06:15,847 --> 01:06:18,938
OK, I go to Lantau Island with you

714
01:06:20,481 --> 01:06:21,639
Why do you drive me away so insistly?

715
01:06:21,781 --> 01:06:25,111
Why? I don't want you to be killed tomorrow

716
01:06:25,348 --> 01:06:26,711
when you go out

717
01:06:27,847 --> 01:06:29,006
You know he is just a mad dog

718
01:06:29,181 --> 01:06:31,272
Why don't you listen to me not to provoke him?

719
01:06:31,481 --> 01:06:34,776
It's him who provoked me, I didn't provoke him

720
01:06:34,948 --> 01:06:37,380
Don't you think I should just about it! I have the power to play, haven't I?

721
01:06:38,747 --> 01:06:40,145
Don't you have the power to play with him?

722
01:06:41,214 --> 01:06:44,146
If you have, you won't be beaten so heavily and have face swollen up

723
01:06:47,148 --> 01:06:49,943
Yes, I was beaten to have face swollen

724
01:06:50,081 --> 01:06:52,343
You are blaming me on losing you face, you can leave me alone

725
01:06:57,548 --> 01:07:02,537
No one force you to speak this Don't speak it for fun

726
01:07:04,181 --> 01:07:05,840
I leave you alone now

727
01:07:06,114 --> 01:07:07,546
If you are safe when you go out tomorrow

728
01:07:07,781 --> 01:07:09,111
I'll do anything for you

729
01:07:51,747 --> 01:07:54,009
We all don't know what will happen tomorrow

730
01:07:54,914 --> 01:07:55,937
Do you agree?

731
01:08:06,981 --> 01:08:07,810
Let's go eating out!

732
01:08:11,381 --> 01:08:12,312
Come along!

733
01:08:46,315 --> 01:08:47,144
Beat him!

734
01:08:51,614 --> 01:08:54,103
Fly, I twist your face I twist you to death

735
01:08:57,048 --> 01:08:59,105
I can plot against you this time, can't I?

736
01:09:00,348 --> 01:09:01,608
Don't beat my Big Brother

737
01:09:01,747 --> 01:09:04,941
Leave him alone. Just beat me up

738
01:09:05,081 --> 01:09:06,740
Not enough?

739
01:09:06,881 --> 01:09:09,370
Let me beat your brother up. That makes you two pairs

740
01:09:09,514 --> 01:09:11,946
I want you to see how I fool around your brother

741
01:09:12,114 --> 01:09:13,341
Shit

742
01:09:17,415 --> 01:09:18,744
fight back

743
01:09:22,981 --> 01:09:25,106
I, Tony, is very justified

744
01:09:25,647 --> 01:09:29,375
An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth

745
01:09:33,514 --> 01:09:37,742
Don't move! It's the most sensitive place of you

746
01:09:37,914 --> 01:09:40,312
I don't know where will you eject if you move

747
01:09:46,981 --> 01:09:51,141
Great! I'm lucky this time

748
01:09:51,248 --> 01:09:54,873
Will I still be so lucky next time?

749
01:09:58,747 --> 01:10:00,213
You are so excited

750
01:10:00,414 --> 01:10:01,573
Do you want to join our party?

751
01:10:01,714 --> 01:10:03,543
OK! Come join us! Come on!

752
01:10:06,447 --> 01:10:08,311
You cannot move a little

753
01:10:08,881 --> 01:10:11,472
You will eject on this brother

754
01:10:11,614 --> 01:10:13,274
or that if you move

755
01:10:17,614 --> 01:10:23,808
Don't let them look down on you?

756
01:10:24,781 --> 01:10:27,247
If I cannot escape today

757
01:10:28,048 --> 01:10:29,707
You must go back to Til-gang Lin

758
01:10:30,014 --> 01:10:33,174
& never go out again

759
01:10:37,781 --> 01:10:39,304
Tough guy

760
01:10:39,447 --> 01:10:41,572
But whether you are tougher than this thing

761
01:10:43,248 --> 01:10:45,180
It's very hard... very hard...

762
01:10:45,315 --> 01:10:50,009
Very, hard, isn't it... very hard isn't it...

763
01:11:08,914 --> 01:11:10,504
Look at you, bitch!

764
01:11:22,681 --> 01:11:24,704
Another one collapsed

765
01:11:26,614 --> 01:11:29,137
Damn you! You are pissing!

766
01:11:29,281 --> 01:11:32,179
You should wear him a napkin before taking him out

767
01:11:32,347 --> 01:11:35,007
What kind of Big Brother are you?

768
01:11:36,948 --> 01:11:40,142
Right! Let your head down

769
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:43,006
so that you can see your face by the urine

770
01:11:43,948 --> 01:11:46,505
And see why you are such a failure

771
01:11:48,248 --> 01:11:52,180
Then, go back to your motherland and farm with your Big Brother

772
01:11:53,380 --> 01:11:57,574
Urban road is not suitable for you? Do you understand?

773
01:12:21,647 --> 01:12:24,239
It's alright, alright!

774
01:12:31,247 --> 01:12:34,338
Where... are you going?

775
01:12:42,380 --> 01:12:44,346
I'm letting you lose face

776
01:12:45,414 --> 01:12:47,346
Just treat that you've never know me

777
01:12:49,014 --> 01:12:51,479
From now on I have no business to do with you

778
01:12:51,647 --> 01:12:53,272
Just leave me alone

779
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:05,038
Cousin

780
01:14:09,881 --> 01:14:12,006
Open the door! Open up!

781
01:14:13,347 --> 01:14:14,540
Open the door!

782
01:14:17,547 --> 01:14:18,570
Hurry up! Open the door!

783
01:14:19,948 --> 01:14:20,675
What's the matter?

784
01:14:20,847 --> 01:14:22,142
My cousin felt to the ground & hurt himself

785
01:14:27,514 --> 01:14:29,673
He's alright. Let him take a rest first

786
01:14:37,213 --> 01:14:38,509
Where have you been last night?

787
01:14:40,948 --> 01:14:42,107
I was staying with cousin

788
01:14:51,514 --> 01:14:53,343
Lock the door when you leave!

789
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:56,309
Give me a phone if anything happens

790
01:15:43,581 --> 01:15:44,706
She's coming

791
01:15:44,881 --> 01:15:46,244
Hey, receive guests

792
01:15:46,447 --> 01:15:47,174
I'm sorry

793
01:15:47,347 --> 01:15:48,643
You talk to each other first

794
01:15:59,447 --> 01:16:02,572
Shooting in a police station won't cause death penalty

795
01:16:02,981 --> 01:16:04,640
Go to jail for several years

796
01:16:04,814 --> 01:16:06,143
and become a man when you come out!

797
01:16:06,881 --> 01:16:08,608
Now people call you boy,

798
01:16:08,747 --> 01:16:10,474
and they'll call you "sir" tomorrow

799
01:16:10,914 --> 01:16:14,107
It's a chance to be famous! Understanding?

800
01:16:14,347 --> 01:16:15,608
Godfather. I'm afraid!

801
01:16:15,948 --> 01:16:19,880
What? Afraid! You've drew the lots and now you said you afraid

802
01:16:20,047 --> 01:16:23,377
Every colleague will kill you even if I let you go

803
01:16:24,147 --> 01:16:26,943
Don't say so much! Keep going!

804
01:16:27,180 --> 01:16:29,078
Godfather, I'm really afraid

805
01:16:29,847 --> 01:16:30,778
Chicken-hearted

806
01:16:32,314 --> 01:16:36,508
Godfather, I've got something to talk to you

807
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:39,842
$23.5 with tin. Here is $30. No change. Thanks

808
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:45,343
Ah-site

809
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:47,241
Brother

810
01:16:48,781 --> 01:16:52,144
You're a different person after you become a fahter

811
01:16:55,180 --> 01:16:57,942
I have no choice. I have a young wife and baby

812
01:16:58,347 --> 01:16:59,973
I'll do anything for living

813
01:17:00,747 --> 01:17:05,372
Take the money

814
01:17:05,614 --> 01:17:06,307
What are you doing?

815
01:17:06,881 --> 01:17:08,346
I promised you

816
01:17:09,847 --> 01:17:11,437
I'm sorry for last time

817
01:17:12,447 --> 01:17:16,243
Please find a luxurious resturant this time

818
01:17:18,180 --> 01:17:20,975
And the lest of the money is for the celebratim of your son's first month

819
01:17:22,247 --> 01:17:25,509
Remember, don't let your wife's famlty look down on you

820
01:17:25,681 --> 01:17:27,579
Do you understand?

821
01:17:27,747 --> 01:17:28,508
How can you get the money?

822
01:17:28,681 --> 01:17:31,078
It's none of your business

823
01:17:41,113 --> 01:17:45,546
I'll not around. Call borther wah if you get in trouble

824
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:51,644
We didn't do any big thing

825
01:17:52,147 --> 01:17:53,613
I feel ashamed

826
01:17:54,514 --> 01:17:55,241
Don't say that, brother

827
01:17:55,347 --> 01:17:56,472
Linsten to me

828
01:18:04,247 --> 01:18:14,238
You may despise me in the past

829
01:18:18,647 --> 01:18:23,739
Yes, I deserve that

830
01:18:24,947 --> 01:18:34,336
But 2 days later, when you read paper and watch TV

831
01:18:35,913 --> 01:18:39,710
You'll realize that I'm not an idiot

832
01:18:43,647 --> 01:18:45,670
I can be your big brother

833
01:18:57,781 --> 01:19:02,940
Remember to tell everyone you

834
01:19:10,113 --> 01:19:10,874
Remember

835
01:19:36,180 --> 01:19:37,407
Do these clothes suit you?

836
01:19:39,547 --> 01:19:41,206
You didn't sleep the whole night! Take a rest!

837
01:19:43,147 --> 01:19:44,238
I can't sleep!

838
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:58,674
Don't worry! Just slight injury! It's alright!

839
01:19:59,747 --> 01:20:02,542
You're lucky this time, but what about the next time?

840
01:20:04,213 --> 01:20:05,838
I've never thought about next time in doing anything

841
01:20:07,681 --> 01:20:13,204
Just one thing

842
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:16,241
I want to be with you next time when I go touring

843
01:20:18,747 --> 01:20:23,111
I've said this twice I won't take it back

844
01:20:24,414 --> 01:20:25,675
What are your opinion?

845
01:20:35,314 --> 01:20:41,304
Come on! Come to me!

846
01:21:33,681 --> 01:21:36,203
Brother Wah! My Big Brother have given me a lot of money last night

847
01:21:37,547 --> 01:21:39,103
and told me to hold banquet again

848
01:21:39,647 --> 01:21:41,010
And he said I would know

849
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:42,644
he was not coward when I read newspaper two days later,

850
01:21:42,780 --> 01:21:44,303
Brother Wah, would you come out at once

851
01:21:46,013 --> 01:21:48,377
Nobody will care about him if you don't

852
01:21:59,113 --> 01:22:00,477
I'm coming now

853
01:22:06,980 --> 01:22:07,877
Going out again?

854
01:22:08,713 --> 01:22:10,111
Nothing! Some kind of friend

855
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:11,439
called me out to talk a while

856
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:14,337
Right! I'll go to buy some medicine

857
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:15,639
in Silver Mine Bay

858
01:22:37,247 --> 01:22:38,611
Do you want me to buy anything for you?

859
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:43,044
I'll be back soon

860
01:24:08,746 --> 01:24:09,677
Double eight

861
01:24:09,913 --> 01:24:11,311
Miss Cheung called you

862
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:12,968
to tell you that medicine was not important

863
01:24:13,147 --> 01:24:16,738
But took care of yourself and came back earlier

864
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:48,604
I win again

865
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:51,075
Give me money

866
01:24:53,414 --> 01:24:54,345
Count it later

867
01:25:07,646 --> 01:25:10,340
Why not tell me you're changed your address, Tony?

868
01:25:12,180 --> 01:25:13,509
Get up...

869
01:25:13,646 --> 01:25:16,044
Do you know the game rules here?

870
01:25:18,013 --> 01:25:19,569
You don't welcome me?

871
01:25:22,113 --> 01:25:25,170
Give me money

872
01:25:25,913 --> 01:25:27,538
I don't want to be screwed up

873
01:25:29,980 --> 01:25:33,707
You're been screwed up

874
01:25:33,846 --> 01:25:35,971
Even you feel sorry, your son will have no ass

875
01:25:36,113 --> 01:25:36,635
What are you talking?

876
01:25:36,780 --> 01:25:38,076
What? What?

877
01:25:38,846 --> 01:25:40,505
Let him be the boss 2 days

878
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:43,908
He never be the boss. He risks his lefe for that

879
01:25:44,147 --> 01:25:47,011
Just 2 days

880
01:25:51,380 --> 01:25:52,777
Come on

881
01:25:53,380 --> 01:25:54,640
seven tile of cirdes

882
01:26:03,247 --> 01:26:07,542
Do you know the rules? Get another tile

883
01:26:13,013 --> 01:26:13,774
Eight

884
01:26:22,247 --> 01:26:25,804
I'm sorry

885
01:26:26,147 --> 01:26:27,578
Come on

886
01:26:30,479 --> 01:26:31,309
Don't fool me

887
01:26:31,380 --> 01:26:32,209
Leave him alone

888
01:26:33,479 --> 01:26:34,911
Let him be a two days hero

889
01:26:37,479 --> 01:26:41,207
You're very patient. Goddam you!

890
01:26:50,646 --> 01:26:54,101
You think I don't dare to beat you?

891
01:26:54,646 --> 01:26:55,839
Come and beat me

892
01:26:56,347 --> 01:26:57,778
If you beat me

893
01:26:58,746 --> 01:27:01,837
I'll lie down

894
01:27:02,180 --> 01:27:04,237
And you'll get into big-mouth kay's trouble

895
01:27:04,413 --> 01:27:09,937
Come on

896
01:27:10,546 --> 01:27:11,534
Goddam you!

897
01:27:12,379 --> 01:27:13,675
Shit

898
01:27:14,213 --> 01:27:18,009
I'll shoot him if you move

899
01:27:19,846 --> 01:27:21,778
Shoot him if you dare

900
01:27:22,013 --> 01:27:24,275
Are you threatening me?

901
01:27:24,379 --> 01:27:26,675
Pull the trigger and shoot me

902
01:27:32,213 --> 01:27:33,940
Don't shoot

903
01:27:35,247 --> 01:27:38,679
No...

904
01:27:45,479 --> 01:27:50,003
Are you scared, Asshole?

905
01:27:50,147 --> 01:27:50,976
Let me blow off your head

906
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:54,939
No..., don't shoot him

907
01:27:55,147 --> 01:27:57,238
I wanted to shoot him

908
01:27:57,413 --> 01:27:59,312
But you're not worth to be shot

909
01:28:02,413 --> 01:28:06,039
These are the money that I owe you. Take it

910
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:11,142
You must take it. Or you'll lose your chance

911
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:13,973
Take it. Or I'll shoot you

912
01:28:19,180 --> 01:28:20,770
Say thank you

913
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:25,609
Thank you

914
01:28:30,213 --> 01:28:33,202
You're nothing even you wear suits with call phone

915
01:28:35,113 --> 01:28:36,635
Be the man of such brother

916
01:28:39,446 --> 01:28:41,140
And you'll go to hell

917
01:28:53,013 --> 01:28:54,501
We just want to make money

918
01:28:54,646 --> 01:28:57,010
You mean I shouldn't take the money even he pay me back?

919
01:28:57,680 --> 01:28:58,907
Take it and go dancing

920
01:29:03,846 --> 01:29:06,971
You treat your brother like that

921
01:29:20,379 --> 01:29:24,243
I'm in grocery, mon. Do you come up?

922
01:29:24,713 --> 01:29:25,804
What is going on?

923
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:28,012
Nothing. I know you don't like feeling hot

924
01:29:28,246 --> 01:29:30,110
So I buy you a air conditioner

925
01:29:30,913 --> 01:29:34,242
We're installed it down there. This one just leave in to you

926
01:29:35,446 --> 01:29:38,174
I don't come up. Your father is here

927
01:29:39,047 --> 01:29:41,410
He's your husband, not my father

928
01:30:17,346 --> 01:30:18,972
When will you calm down and stop escaping?

929
01:30:19,846 --> 01:30:21,334
Why did you come out to see me?

930
01:30:22,513 --> 01:30:24,070
Why don't you leave me alone?

931
01:30:25,813 --> 01:30:29,041
Who will care for you if I don't?

932
01:30:35,780 --> 01:30:38,245
Don't think that you'll be famous after this task

933
01:30:40,279 --> 01:30:46,008
Right, everybody will say you are brave this time when you do that

934
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:49,839
But no one will remember you next week

935
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:52,511
But what become of you then?

936
01:30:53,047 --> 01:30:55,171
No one will know you later

937
01:31:07,580 --> 01:31:09,842
I've done many things for godfather also

938
01:31:12,580 --> 01:31:17,444
I had received money for death when I was fourteen

939
01:31:20,713 --> 01:31:22,269
I was greater than a lot of people, right?

940
01:31:23,313 --> 01:31:26,245
But look at me! I'm just an ordinary man now

941
01:31:26,580 --> 01:31:30,273
Anyway, you were famous for sometime!

942
01:31:31,379 --> 01:31:34,607
But what about me?

943
01:31:37,246 --> 01:31:40,474
No one notice me and you are happy about that

944
01:31:40,980 --> 01:31:42,878
People look down upon everything of me

945
01:31:43,179 --> 01:31:45,975
They even said that I was a dog beneath you ass

946
01:31:46,146 --> 01:31:47,442
Do you know that?

947
01:31:51,179 --> 01:31:54,111
I would rather be three-minute hero

948
01:31:54,313 --> 01:31:56,245
I don't want to be a fly for all my life

949
01:31:58,546 --> 01:32:01,239
Let me finish a great task on my own, would you?

950
01:32:01,913 --> 01:32:03,344
Just for this time

951
01:32:17,913 --> 01:32:23,345
OK! Did you decide to go?

952
01:32:24,980 --> 01:32:26,741
I'll go with you if you want to

953
01:32:27,913 --> 01:32:29,640
I'll take revenge for you if you are shoot down

954
01:32:29,813 --> 01:32:32,643
Don't treat me so good, would you?

955
01:32:36,780 --> 01:32:38,678
I can't pay you back

956
01:32:40,279 --> 01:32:42,268
I don't want to talk so much with you

957
01:32:42,413 --> 01:32:44,538
Just say it, and I'll go with you

958
01:32:45,980 --> 01:32:49,969
We'll go to Lantau Island if you say no

959
01:32:53,246 --> 01:32:55,212
I'll settle anything following

960
01:33:02,413 --> 01:33:06,743
OK! OK! OK!

961
01:33:06,947 --> 01:33:08,207
I go back with you

962
01:33:24,079 --> 01:33:25,375
Ah-choi, Ah-choi

963
01:33:25,580 --> 01:33:27,068
Don't look down upon other

964
01:33:27,580 --> 01:33:29,944
He used to be great and famous but now he was finished

965
01:33:31,413 --> 01:33:34,971
Don't be so stingily! Give something to Ah-cho
