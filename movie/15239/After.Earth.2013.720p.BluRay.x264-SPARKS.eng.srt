1
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,912
Mayday, Mayday, this is
Hesper Two-Niner-Niner in distress.

2
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,115
Dad!

3
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,954
Engines 1 and 2 are off-line!
We're losing her!

4
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,395
GO! G0!

5
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,795
Dad!

6
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,238
I've heard stories of Earth.

7
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,794
A paradise.

8
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,633
Until we destroyed it.

9
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,150
The founding of the United
Ranger Corps 1000 years ago...

10
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,149
...was a global military effort,
an evacuation of Earth.

11
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,111
The Rangers would lead the settlement
of mankind's new home.

12
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,394
Nova Prime.

13
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,920
But we were not alone.

14
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,830
The aliens released the Ursa.

15
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,234
Monsters bred to kill humans.

16
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,350
Technically blind,
the Ursa sees humans...

17
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,154
...based on pheromones
we secrete when frightened.

18
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,591
They literally smell our fear.

19
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,109
Humankind was again
in danger of extinction...

20
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,073
...and again turned to the Rangers
for the answer.

21
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,277
That answer came in the form of
the prime commander, Cypher Raige...

22
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,471
...the original ghost.

23
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,758
He is believed to be
so completely free of fear...

24
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,713
...that to an Ursa, he is invisible.

25
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,231
This phenomena is known
as "ghosting."

26
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,078
This isn't a race, cadet!

27
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,439
Raige.

28
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,550
Your test scores are very impressive.

29
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,478
In the classroom,
you are an outstanding Ranger...

30
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,553
...but in the field, you collapse.

31
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,551
I'm not advancing you.
You may try again next year.

32
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,630
Sir, I am dedicated, have studied...

33
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,394
...and display conduct
becoming of a Ranger, sir.

34
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,951
I request that the commander
reconsider his assessment, sir.

35
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:58,952
- Cadet.
- Sir, my father's returning home tonight.

36
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,317
I haven't seen him in--

37
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,517
It's a very special day for our family.

38
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:10,029
And I have got to be able to tell him
that I am a Ranger, sir.

39
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,869
You tell your father...

40
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,477
...that I said, "Welcome home."

41
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,431
Dismissed.

42
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,953
Faia.

43
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,110
Hi.

44
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,233
How were finals?

45
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,951
- How were finals?
- I wasn't advanced to Ranger.

46
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,116
Where do we look when we speak?

47
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,473
I was not advanced to Ranger.

48
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,554
You were not advanced to Ranger...

49
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,276
I was not advanced to Ranger, sir.

50
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,593
That's all right. You're young.

51
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,752
I ran the canyons 11 seconds faster
than you did.

52
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:52,839
You weren't ready. Velan's a good man.
He knows his stuff.

53
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,670
If you were, he would have promoted you.
You weren't ready.

54
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,271
I'm not hungry. I'm going to my room.

55
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,273
- Are you asking me or telling me?
- May I go to my room?

56
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,272
Denied! Sit down!

57
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,231
I have a last visit to lphitos.

58
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,598
I'm flying tomorrow,
supervising training.

59
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,152
And after it's completed...

60
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,632
...l'm announcing my retirement.

61
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,993
Retirement?

62
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,675
Maybe I'll work with you...

63
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,719
...in Turbine Division.

64
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,239
- Together.
- Please, no.

65
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,832
I want my family back.

66
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,474
I want you back.

67
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,797
That boy in there is trying to find you.

68
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,750
He's a feeling boy.

69
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,716
He's an intuitive boy.

70
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,354
He watched you read that book
with Senshi his entire life.

71
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,633
He's reading that book now.

72
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,510
He's reaching for you.

73
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,797
Don't get me wrong.
I respect everything you've done.

74
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:45,396
But you have a son in the other room
that you do not know.

75
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,719
He blames himself
for what happened to Senshi.

76
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,919
He thinks it's his fault.

77
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,753
He's drowning.

78
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,198
And he does not need
a commanding officer.

79
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,036
He needs a father.

80
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,675
Pack your bags.
You're coming with me to lphitos.

81
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,553
This was a really good decision.

82
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,672
Now go make
some good memories together.

83
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,952
You take it easy on your father.
He's a little rusty.

84
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,190
Okay.

85
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,592
General Raige.

86
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,677
I was on the plateau.

87
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,520
You saved me and four others.

88
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:36,157
I just came from seeing
my baby girl's face for the first time.

89
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,435
- Stand me up.
- That won't be necessary, Ranger.

90
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,193
Stand me up.

91
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,279
Watch the left side!

92
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,153
Pull!

93
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,358
Perimeter's good.

94
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,271
I'm reading Moby Dick.

95
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,469
Your mother told me. That's great.

96
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:30,153
Our military transport will arrive at
training base on lphitos in seven hours.

97
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,431
I'm going to grab some rack time.
I recommend you do the same.

98
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,916
Hey. Can you read?

99
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,231
I said, can you read?

100
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,795
Yes, sir.

101
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,917
Well, there's a sign back there.

102
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:35,039
"Authorized personnel only."

103
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,993
Why didn't you read that?

104
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,154
What's in the cage?

105
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,437
Might wanna go easy on him, sarge.

106
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,638
That's the prime commander's son
right there.

107
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,994
You're Raige's kid?

108
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,276
What's in there?

109
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,358
You wanna see?

110
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,350
- Kit, we have to go right now.
-ls that--?

111
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,558
They surprised us.
Sent ships, dropped those things.

112
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,355
An Ursa?

113
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,439
We're taking it to lphitos
for ghost training.

114
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,429
You want to see if you can ghost?

115
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:02,672
Ghosting is when you don't have
a trace of fear in you.

116
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,114
Most guys freeze.

117
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,234
That's your cerebral cortex
looking for an answer it doesn't have.

118
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,597
See? Even your brain knows
you're screwed.

119
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,110
Your blood is filling
with adrenaline now...

120
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,070
...whether you know it or not.

121
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,197
Your heart's beating faster.

122
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,590
It's getting a little harder to breathe.

123
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:48,753
Your neurobiological system
is telling you to run...

124
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,719
...but your knees are too weak to move.

125
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,550
And it's too late anyway.

126
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,838
The pores on your skin
have already opened up...

127
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,918
...secreting an imperceptible amount
of pheromones into the air.

128
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,880
And all you can think about
is when it's going to kill you.

129
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,594
Senshi!

130
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,150
She sees you, kid.

131
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,431
Attention on deck.

132
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,911
Kitai. Back to your seat, now.

133
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,558
Rangers, go Redcon-1.

134
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,836
Secure all cargo!

135
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:44,354
Behind your seat, there's a life suit.
Put it on. Strap in, full harness.

136
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,079
Yes, sir.

137
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,798
- Good evening, general.
- Captain.

138
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:58,113
What's the last known position
of the closest asteroid storm?

139
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,440
Category-four asteroid formation.

140
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,434
Two thousand kilometers to starboard
at plus-four-five declination.

141
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,114
I detected graviton vibrations
in the hull.

142
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,833
But you detected how?

143
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,039
Graviton buildup could be a precursor
to mass expansion.

144
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,231
That storm could be on us in minutes.

145
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,552
But, sir, mass expansion
is one in a million.

146
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,029
If we try to navigate out...

147
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,114
...the pull of our own graviton weight
could set the thing off.

148
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,873
Let's just hold course
and hope I'm wrong.

149
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,950
Just out of interest, sir,
how often are you wrong?

150
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,230
My wife would give
a very interesting answer to that question.

151
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,829
Graviton count's decreasing.
Eight hundred parts per million.

152
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,436
Six hundred and fifty.

153
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,359
Well, sir, there's a first time
for everything.

154
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,633
Turn into it. Match bearing.

155
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,154
Dad!

156
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,632
She's a dead stick! Engines off-line!
We're losing her!

157
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,871
- Can you travel us out of here?
- Where?

158
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,951
The anchorage. Lycia. It's closest.

159
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,476
Negative, sir. We cannot
wormhole travel in the middle of this.

160
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,199
Do it.

161
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,755
Coordinates for anchorage at Lycia
locked in. No confirmation signal.

162
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,479
Travel us now.

163
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,916
- Without confirmation--
- That's an order.

164
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,230
Go! Go!

165
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,516
Cabin pressure dropping.

166
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,710
Heavy damage to outer hull.
Breach possible in middle cabin.

167
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,713
Find me something I can land on. Now.

168
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,919
I got something.

169
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,914
Bearing three-four-zero by nine-five,
range 86,000.

170
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,793
Warning. This planet has been declared
unfit for human habitation...

171
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,749
...placed under class-one quarantine
by the interplanetary Authority.

172
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:52,038
Under penalty of law,
do not attempt to land.

173
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,238
Repeat, do not attempt to land.

174
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,509
It's not possible.

175
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,789
The computer might have defaulted
back to a known demarcation point.

176
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,830
No, not here.

177
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,354
Travel us again.

178
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,951
Negative, sir. This ship
is going to tear apart at any moment.

179
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,191
Set her down.

180
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,272
Mayday, Mayday, this is
Hesper Two-Niner-Niner in distress.

181
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:36,513
We took damage from an asteroid storm
and are going down with bingo power.

182
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,151
Dad, Dad, Dad!

183
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,751
Dad!

184
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,752
You all right?

185
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,558
You stay there.

186
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,113
Evaluate.

187
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,472
Good to go.

188
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,790
Confirm the Ursa is contained.

189
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,076
The back of the ship is gone.

190
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,957
Rangers, count off.

191
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,716
Rangers, count off!

192
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,480
Kit.

193
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,349
The cockpit is directly above us.

194
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,119
Go.

195
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:01,835
Left rear, there's a utility compartment.

196
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,597
Inside...

197
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,793
...there's an emergency beacon.

198
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,559
Silver.

199
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,439
Like a saucer. Bring it to me.

200
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,160
Consolidate. Inventory up.

201
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,192
General Cypher Raige.

202
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,271
We crash-landed.

203
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,394
Two confirmed survivors.

204
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,033
Kitai.

205
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:01,675
The emergency beacon you brought me
will fire a distress signal deep into space.

206
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,433
But it is damaged.

207
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,191
There is another one
in the tail section of our ship.

208
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,551
This is us here.

209
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:20,718
That is the tail, somewhere in this area.

210
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,993
It's approximately 100 kilometers
from here.

211
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,389
We need that beacon.

212
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,993
Do you understand?

213
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,276
Both my legs are broken,
one very badly.

214
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:47,432
You are going to retrieve that beacon...

215
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,395
...or we are going to die.

216
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,556
Do you understand?

217
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,438
Repeat what I just said to you.

218
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,078
I have to go retrieve the beacon...

219
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,359
...or we're going to die.

220
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,757
You have air filtration inhalers.

221
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,271
You need to take one now.

222
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,796
The fluid will coat your lungs,
increasing oxygen extraction...

223
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,952
...allowing you to breathe comfortably
in the environment.

224
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,239
You have six vials.

225
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,073
At your weight, that should be 20 to
24 hours each. That's more than enough.

226
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,632
Your life suit and backpack...

227
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,474
...are equipped
with digital and virtual imaging...

228
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,959
...so I will be able to see
everything that you see...

229
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,554
...and what you do not see.

230
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,434
I will guide you.

231
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,149
It will be like I'm right there with you.

232
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,037
Take my cutlass.

233
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,551
It's the C-40.

234
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,838
The full 22 configurations.

235
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,354
Kitai...

236
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,477
...every single decision you make
will be life or death.

237
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,113
This is a class-one quarantined planet.

238
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:15,114
Everything on this planet
has evolved to kill humans.

239
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,075
D0 you know where we are?

240
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,672
No, sir.

241
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,239
This is Earth.

242
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,793
The Ursa?

243
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:50,193
Three possibilities. The first
and most likely is that it died in the crash.

244
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:56,036
The second and less likely is that it is
injured very badly and still contained.

245
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,477
The third and least likely is
that it is out.

246
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:04,035
We will proceed, however,
in anticipation of the worst-case scenario.

247
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:09,277
Every movement will be
under protocol Escape and Evade.

248
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,351
If he's out there...

249
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,433
...l will see him long before
he gets anywhere near you.

250
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,716
Do you understand?

251
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,519
Yes, sir.

252
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:22,911
Do exactly as I tell you...

253
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,355
...and we will survive.

254
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,033
Kitai, calm down.

255
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,952
Take a knee.

256
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,959
Root yourself
in this present moment now.

257
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,198
Sight, sound, smell.

258
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,510
What do you feel?

259
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,793
My body feels heavier.

260
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,312
Very good. Earth's gravitational pull
is different than at home.

261
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,959
Very good.

262
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,392
Now let's go.

263
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,239
What happened?

264
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:15,829
- You didn't see that?
- Kitai, what happened?

265
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,952
I'm fine. No change. ljust slipped.

266
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,030
There's condensation on the stones.

267
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,157
I'm good to go.

268
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,995
General Cypher Raige.

269
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,879
Initiating remote probe recon.

270
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,115
Primary target...

271
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,837
...Ursa.

272
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:03,310
I want to reiterate that your naviband
is our sole means of communication.

273
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,635
Roger.

274
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:09,673
The temperatures on this planet
fluctuate dangerously, Kitai.

275
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:13,629
And most of the planet
freezes over completely at night.

276
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,790
But there are hot spots...

277
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,474
...geothermal nodes
between here and the tail...

278
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,393
...that will keep you warm
during the freeze-over.

279
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,631
You must reach one
of these hot spots...

280
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,953
...each evening before nightfall.
ls that understood?

281
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,519
COPY-

282
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,039
Standard operating procedure until
I give you further instructions. Stand by.

283
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,758
Dad, are you there?

284
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,518
Hey, Dad, are you there?

285
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,994
Dad...

286
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,555
...you there?

287
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,315
Hello ?

288
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,755
I'm here.

289
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,231
A boy I know had this.

290
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,916
It's a real book. From a museum.

291
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,237
It's Moby Dick.

292
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,877
He said I could even hold on to it.

293
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,435
Hold on to what?

294
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,549
The book, Dad.

295
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,117
Did they really kill these whales?

296
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,277
We, Senshi, for their oil...

297
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,272
...and they almost disappeared.

298
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,351
Just before the age of carbon fuels.

299
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,591
Where's your brother?

300
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,194
Kit.

301
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,474
H9)'-

302
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,272
Dad, are you there?

303
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,710
I'm here.

304
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,436
Where are you?

305
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,354
My suit's turned black.
I like it, but I think it's something bad.

306
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:05,718
Your suit is made of smart fabric.
It has motion sensors.

307
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:09,032
I'm tracking a life form
moving toward you from the west.

308
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,315
It's closing rapidly.

309
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,599
Fifty meters.

310
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,200
Forty.

311
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,953
Thirty.

312
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,198
Twenty.

313
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,599
Ten.

314
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,039
It is right there, Kitai.

315
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,957
Do not move.

316
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,997
Recognize your power.

317
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,231
This will be your creation.

318
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,351
Stand down, cadet.

319
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,594
- Get out of here!
- Kitai!

320
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,672
Control yourself, cadet!

321
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,233
Kitai, stand down!

322
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,754
Get away!

323
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,556
- Get away!
- Kitai!

324
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,634
To your rear. Out to your rear.

325
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,831
There's a river
250 meters straight ahead. Go.

326
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,831
They are no longer in pursuit.

327
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,230
Cadet, you are not being followed.

328
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:41,030
I repeat, you are not being followed.

329
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,431
Kitai, you are running from nothing!

330
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,358
Kitai!

331
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,874
Kitai.

332
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,439
Put my damn cutlass away.

333
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,792
You are not being followed.
Take a knee.

334
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,710
Take a knee, cadet!

335
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,874
If you want to die today that is fine,
but you are not going to kill me.

336
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:24,234
Kitai, I need you
to do a physical assessment.

337
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,279
You are showing rapid
blood contamination. Are you cut?

338
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:32,833
- I'm dizzy.
- Kitai, self-eval.

339
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:55,357
- Dad, I can't stand.
- Open your med kit.

340
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:59,275
You are going to have to administer
the antitoxin in sequence.

341
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,750
Inject yourself with the clear liquid first.

342
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,359
Do it now.

343
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,595
I can't see.

344
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,958
The poison is affecting
your nervous system. Stay even.

345
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,993
Dad, please come help me. I can't see.

346
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,074
I can't do this by myself, Dad.
Please come get me.

347
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:26,677
Kitai, inject yourself directly
into your heart with the first stage.

348
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,478
Do it now.

349
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,711
Now the second. ASAP.

350
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,273
To your left, Kitai.

351
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,716
- Left!
- I can't feel my hand.

352
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,911
Dad, I can't feel my hands.

353
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,991
Press it into the ground.

354
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,799
Roll over on it
and press it into the ground, Kitai.

355
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,710
Great work, cadet.

356
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,512
But you are going to have to lie there
for a moment.

357
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,877
The parasite that stung you...

358
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,872
...has a paralyzing agent in its venom.

359
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:51,432
S0 you are going to have to lie there
for a little bit...

360
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:55,672
...while the antitoxin does its job.

361
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,916
It's time to wake up.

362
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,999
Son.

363
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:21,233
The temperature is dropping
five degrees every 10 minutes.

364
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,437
You have got to wake up.

365
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,316
Can you blink your eyes?

366
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,559
Son.

367
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:40,838
I need you to please blink your eyes.

368
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,431
Hey, Dad.

369
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,279
H93'-

370
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:09,236
- That sucked.
- That is correct.

371
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:13,557
You've got 9.7 kilometers
to the hot spot.

372
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:17,475
How about you show me that 10K
in 50 minutes, cadet?

373
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:18,995
Sir, yes, sir.

374
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,955
Ten mikes out. All good.

375
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,756
Who wasn't advanced to Ranger?
Who was it?

376
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,951
Watch him go. Watch him go.

377
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:07,351
Five mikes out.

378
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,393
Five mikes out.

379
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,393
Happy 19th birthday, Senshi.

380
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:15,755
Here.

381
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,677
Dad, you help me.

382
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,511
No, Senshi, you go ahead. You blow.

383
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,032
Come on, Dad. Blow.

384
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:30,637
Now, you know there's no way
I can actually do that from here.

385
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,429
No. I think you can.

386
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:38,354
Faia, you're right there. Help the girl.

387
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,437
You can do it.

388
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,038
I know you can.

389
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:09,550
Hot Spot 1 arrival.

390
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,311
H plus 54 minutes.

391
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,238
Equipment check and consolidate.

392
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,478
Take your next inhaler.

393
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:39,440
Your oxygen extraction is bottoming.

394
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,954
Take your next breathing fluid.

395
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,393
Second dose of breathing fluid
complete.

396
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,470
Count off remaining.

397
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,836
Four vials remain, sir.

398
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,078
Repeat.

399
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,238
Four vials remain, sir.

400
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,673
Dad.

401
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,679
Dad!

402
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,679
I'm here.

403
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,713
How did you do it?

404
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,630
How did you first ghost?

405
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,071
Out for a run.

406
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:13,118
Alone.

407
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,879
Something we're never
supposed to do.

408
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:22,718
Ursa de-camos right in front of me.

409
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,235
I go for my cutlass.

410
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,670
It shoots its pincer...

411
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:32,195
...right through my shoulder.

412
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:37,998
Next thing I know,
we're over the cliff, falling...

413
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:44,555
...3O meters straight down
into the river.

414
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:50,996
We settle onto the bottom.

415
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:54,397
It's on top of me.

416
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,836
But it's not moving.

417
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,196
And I realize...

418
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,078
...he's trying to drown me.

419
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,229
I'm thinking, "I'm gonna die.

420
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,671
I'm gonna die.

421
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:22,236
I cannot believe
this is how I'm going to die. "

422
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:30,276
I can see my blood bubbling up,
mixing with the sunlight...

423
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,915
...shining through the water.

424
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:38,475
And I think, "WOW...

425
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,752
...that's really pretty."

426
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,640
And everything slows down.

427
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:55,911
And I see its pincer
through my shoulder.

428
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,951
And I decide...

429
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,638
...l don't want that in there anymore.

430
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,991
So I pull it out.

431
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,116
And he lets me go.

432
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:17,160
And more than that, I can tell...

433
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:20,118
...it can't find me.

434
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,799
It doesn't even know where to look.

435
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:30,512
And it dawned on me...

436
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:38,115
...fear is not real.

437
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,674
The only place that fear can exist...

438
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:46,435
...is in our thoughts of the future.

439
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:50,151
It is a product of our imagination...

440
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:53,631
...causing us to fear things
that do not at present...

441
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:56,713
...and may not ever exist.

442
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:01,718
That is near insanity, Kitai.

443
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,871
Now, do not misunderstand me.

444
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:06,680
Danger is very real.

445
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:10,192
But fear is a choice.

446
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:17,797
We are all telling ourselves a story.

447
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:21,559
And that day, mine changed.

448
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:39,912
Fourteen kilometers to the falls.

449
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:42,071
That's our midway checkpoint.

450
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,878
I'm reading you.

451
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:02,752
Kitai, get to the falls ASAP.

452
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:28,111
I hear something.
I think it's water. A lot of it.

453
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,671
Inventory up.

454
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:22,835
Roger.

455
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,719
Food rations, half available. Flares, full.

456
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:29,555
Med kit, half available. Breathing fluid--

457
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:34,632
Breathing fluid, four vials available.

458
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:43,074
Why are you not showing me
the case?

459
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:44,560
What?

460
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,390
Show it to me now.

461
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,030
I thought that I could make it, sir.

462
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:00,271
Abort mission.

463
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:02,795
Return to the ship.

464
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:06,111
That is an order.

465
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,678
Don't come out.

466
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,598
No matter what.

467
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,235
That's an order.

468
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,599
Dad!

469
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:29,553
No, Dad.

470
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:33,630
I can do it. I don't need many.
I can get across with just two.

471
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:38,278
You need a minimum of three inhalers
to make it to the tail.

472
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:40,716
You have exhausted your resources.

473
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:43,514
I can get across.
I can do it with just two, Dad.

474
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:46,520
This mission has reached
aboﬂ criteria.

475
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,635
I take full responsibility.

476
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,195
You did your best.

477
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:55,360
You have nothing more to prove.
Now return to the ship.

478
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,159
What was your mistake?

479
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:01,791
Trusting me?

480
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:04,839
Depending on me,
thinking that I could do this?

481
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,674
I am giving you an order...

482
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:11,031
...to turn around...

483
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,717
...and return to this ship.

484
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,555
You wouldn't give any other Ranger
that order!

485
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:20,751
You are not a Ranger.

486
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:24,799
And I am giving you that order.

487
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:38,040
What was I supposed to do?

488
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:41,954
What did you want me to do?

489
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,518
She gave me an order!

490
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:48,036
She said, no matter what,
don't come out of that box!

491
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:52,589
Was I supposed to just come out
and die?

492
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:55,470
What do you think, cadet?

493
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,757
What do you think
you should have done?

494
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:00,718
Because that is all that matters.

495
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,871
What do you think
you should have done?

496
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:08,433
And where were you?

497
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,955
She called out for you!
She called your name!

498
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:14,033
And you weren't there,
because you're never there!

499
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,589
And you think I'm a coward?

500
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,232
You're wrong!

501
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,789
I'm not a coward!

502
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:27,077
You're the coward!

503
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,516
I'm not a coward!

504
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,200
Kitai!

505
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:50,800
Kitai, you've got incoming.

506
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,790
Do you copy? You've got incoming.

507
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:11,631
Kitai, dive!

508
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:13,235
Dive!

509
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,679
Kitai!

510
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:37,393
No!

511
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,199
Leave them alone!

512
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:55,559
Get away!

513
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:05,839
Dad, I'm sorry. It's Kitai.

514
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:20,916
Where is my son?

515
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:13,594
General Cypher Raige.

516
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:17,920
This is a message for my wife.

517
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,758
Faia.

518
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:28,191
I have lost contact with our son.

519
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:36,471
End message.

520
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:42,229
You have six vials. At your weight,
that should be 20 to 24 hours each.

521
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:43,999
That's more than enough.

522
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:49,515
I estimate four days to reach the tail.
Let's break it into sections.

523
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:52,320
Six hours to reach
the first geothermal site.

524
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:56,155
The first leg, 20 K to the mouth
of the North Forest. I'm right here.

525
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:57,993
- I'm five mikes out.
- Keep moving.

526
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:00,999
- Hot Spot 1 arrival.
- Take your next inhaler.

527
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:03,151
H plus 54 minutes.

528
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:06,392
There is an escarpment.
Looks like it could be a waterfall.

529
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:09,996
- We'll call that midway.
- I can get across. I can do it with two.

530
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:13,232
Fourteen kilometers to the falls.
This is us here.

531
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:16,318
That is the tail.

532
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:19,393
You are going to retrieve
that beacon...

533
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:22,110
...or we are going to die.

534
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:02,397
Leave me alone!

535
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:02,239
Wake up.

536
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:05,876
It's time for you to wake up.

537
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:14,829
H93'-

538
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:17,193
H93'-

539
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:21,993
I was just about to come out that day.

540
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:24,317
No, you weren't.

541
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:28,032
But you did the right thing.

542
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,355
Dad says I should have tried.

543
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,038
He's just mad at himself. That's all.

544
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:43,313
Why couldn't you ghost?

545
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:54,915
- You're close right now.
- I am?

546
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:58,632
Are you scared?

547
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:00,916
No. I'm tired.

548
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:05,233
That's good.

549
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:08,596
You filled your heart
with something else.

550
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:12,438
Now you got to get UP-

551
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:15,114
- I memorized some of Moby Dick.
- Kitai, get up.

552
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:17,635
-"All that maddens and torments...
- Wake up.

553
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:20,036
-...all that stirs up lees of things...
- Wake up.

554
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:23,079
...all truth with malice,
all that cracks the sinews--"

555
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:24,514
Wake up!

556
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:36,918
Kit...

557
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:05,074
Hey, thanks.

558
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:32,598
No.

559
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:12,799
Dad.

560
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:20,791
Dad, it's Kitai. lmade it to--

561
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:24,595
Kitai.

562
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:27,149
Dad, Imade it to the tail. D0 you copy?

563
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:33,230
Kitai, I'm here.

564
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:36,991
- Are you okay?
- Dad, do you read me?

565
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:41,038
IcoPY-

566
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:44,434
Dad, Imade it to the tail. D0 you copy?

567
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:47,433
Kitai, we have electrical interference.

568
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:50,672
You are in a black zone.
I repeat, you are in a black--

569
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:57,676
Dad, the Ursa is not contained.
Please copy.

570
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:11,595
Dad?

571
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:13,872
I'm here.

572
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:17,430
I swear to you I'm here.

573
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:02,360
Take a knee.

574
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:18,954
It is the ionic layer...

575
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:22,480
...in the atmosphere
above your current position.

576
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:27,191
It is causing electrical interference.
That is why the beacon is not firing.

577
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:40,117
To your north.

578
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:41,675
The peak.

579
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:46,034
You must fire the beacon
from the peak of that mountain.

580
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:57,800
See it, Kitai.

581
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:02,317
Please...

582
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:04,559
...see it.

583
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:24,200
Good boy.

584
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:46,429
It is a pheromone trigger.

585
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:49,395
He set it to scare you...

586
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:53,317
...so he can track you. Keep moving.

587
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,590
It has found you.

588
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:11,553
Run.

589
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:14,709
Just run, Kitai.

590
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,070
Just run.

591
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:52,596
Climb in here, okay?
It won't be able to smell you.

592
01:25:57,840 --> 01:25:58,910
Dad!

593
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:21,678
Root yourself
in this present moment now.

594
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:27,190
Sight, sound, smell.

595
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:29,590
What do you feel?

596
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:46,437
You're still in that box.
It's time to come out.

597
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,992
- Stand me up.
- General.

598
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:42,875
I said, stand me up.

599
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:57,073
Watch his back.

600
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:21,715
Dad?

601
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:25,558
Yeah?

602
01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:29,990
I want to work with Mom.

603
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:35,154
Me too.
