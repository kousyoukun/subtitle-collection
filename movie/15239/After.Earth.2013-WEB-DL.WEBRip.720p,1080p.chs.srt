1
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,870
<i>Mayday, mayday.
This is Hesper 2-9-9, heavy in distress.</i>

2
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:28,360
<i>Dad!</i>

3
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,280
<i>Engines 1 and 2 are offline.
We're losing her.</i>

4
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,260
<i>Go! Go!</i>

5
00:00:59,494 --> 00:01:03,600
I've heard stories of Earth.

6
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,700
A paradise...

7
00:01:06,097 --> 00:01:09,847
...until we destroyed it.

8
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:28,270
The founding of the Uniting Ranger Corps,
One thousand years ago...

9
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:30,490
...was a global military effort...

10
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:34,490
...in evacuation of earth.

11
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,220
The rangers would lead the settlement
of mankind in its new home.

12
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,320
Nova Prime.

13
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,260
But we were not alone.

14
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,580
The aliens released the Ursas.

15
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,090
Monsters. Bred to kill humans.

16
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,460
Technically blind.

17
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,650
The Ursas see humans based
on the pheromones...

18
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,650
...secrete when frightened

19
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,550
They literally smell our fear.

20
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:13,080
Humankind was again
in danger of extinction,

21
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,640
and again turned to the rangers
for the answer.

22
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,860
And that answer came in the form...

23
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,440
...of the prime commander Cypher Raige.

24
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,570
The original Ghost.

25
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,720
He's believed to be
soul completely free of fear,

26
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,260
that to an Ursa...

27
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,830
...he's invisible.

28
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:35,630
This phenomena is known as 'Ghosting'.

29
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:45,730
---

30
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:50,380
---

31
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:15,980
This isn't a race, cadet.

32
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,020
Raige.

33
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,170
Your test scores are very impressive.

34
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:34,560
In the classroom you are
an outstanding ranger,

35
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:38,000
but in the field you collapse.

36
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,810
I'm not advancing you.

37
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:43,130
You may try again next year.

38
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,110
Sir, I am dedicated,
I've studied...

39
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:48,140
...and consistently displayed conduct
becoming a ranger, sir.

40
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,330
I request that the commander
reconsider his assessment, sir.

41
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,430
- Cadet...
- Sir,

42
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:59,310
my father is returning home tonight.

43
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:02,360
I haven't seen him in...

44
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:05,290
It's a very special day for our family.

45
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:12,600
and I've gotta be able
to tell him that I'm a ranger, sir.

46
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,520
You tell your father...

47
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,480
...that I said welcome home.

48
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,580
Dismissed.

49
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,400
Faia.

50
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,990
Hi.

51
00:05:04,599 --> 00:05:06,599
How were finals?

52
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,070
- How were finals?
- I wasn't advanced to ranger.

53
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,150
Where do we look when we speak?

54
00:05:19,754 --> 00:05:22,343
I was not advanced to ranger.

55
00:05:25,059 --> 00:05:27,495
You were not advanced to ranger?

56
00:05:27,854 --> 00:05:31,115
I was not advanced to ranger, Sir.

57
00:05:40,121 --> 00:05:41,311
That's all right, you're young...

58
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,700
I ran the canyons 11 seconds
faster than you did.

59
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,790
You weren't ready.

60
00:05:48,878 --> 00:05:51,968
Velan is a good man,
he knows his stuff.

61
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,250
If you were, he would've promoted you.
You weren't ready.

62
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,600
I'm not hungry.
I'm going to my room.

63
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,900
Are you asking me or telling me?

64
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,450
- May I go to my room, sir?
- Denied. Sit down.

65
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:37,480
Our last visit to Iphitos...

66
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,980
...flying tomorrow.

67
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,180
Supervising training...

68
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:46,060
...and after it's completed,

69
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,440
I'm announcing my retirement.

70
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,300
Retirement?

71
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,560
Maybe I'll work with you...

72
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,450
...in Turbine division.

73
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,550
Together.

74
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,400
I want my family back.

75
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,520
I want you back.

76
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:13,360
That boy in there...

77
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,560
...is trying to find you.

78
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,510
He's a feeling boy.

79
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,540
He's an intuitive boy.

80
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:27,060
He watched you read that book
with Senshi his entire life.

81
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,140
He's reading that book now.

82
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,540
He's reaching for you.

83
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,650
Don't get me wrong,

84
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:39,510
I respect everything you've done.

85
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:42,270
But you have a son in the other room that...

86
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:44,580
...who do not know.

87
00:07:44,679 --> 00:07:48,399
He blames himself
on what happened to Senshi.

88
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,020
He thinks it's his fault.

89
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,220
He's drowning.

90
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,850
And he does not need
a commanding officer.

91
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:02,650
He needs a father.

92
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:28,990
Pack your bags.
You're coming with me to Iphitos.

93
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,370
This was a really good decision.

94
00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:01,920
Now go and make some
good memories together.

95
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,080
You take it easy on your father.
He's a little rusty.

96
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,180
Okay.

97
00:09:20,921 --> 00:09:24,113
General Raige.

98
00:09:25,713 --> 00:09:30,041
I was on the Plathom, to save me and four others.

99
00:09:30,661 --> 00:09:35,580
I just came from seeing my baby girl's face for the first time.

100
00:09:36,273 --> 00:09:37,147
Stand me up.

101
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,671
That won't be necessary ranger.

102
00:09:38,698 --> 00:09:41,861
Damn, stand me up.

103
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:17,630
I'm reading 'Moby-Dick'.

104
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:19,940
Your mother told me.

105
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,040
That's great.

106
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:30,220
Our military transporter will arrive
training base on Iphitos in seven hours.

107
00:11:30,319 --> 00:11:39,019
I'm gonna grab some rack time.
I recommend you do the same.

108
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:21,200
Hey.
Can you read?

109
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,940
I said, can you read?

110
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,180
Yes, sir.

111
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,960
Well, there's a sign back there:

112
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:34,260
'Authorized Personnel Only.'

113
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:38,360
Why didn't you read that?

114
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,230
What's in the cage?

115
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:42,720
Might wanna go easy on him, Serge.

116
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:49,120
That's the Prime Commander son
right there.

117
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:55,120
- You're Raige's kid?
- What's in there?

118
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,840
You wanna see?

119
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,590
Kit, we have to go.
Right now.

120
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:07,340
- Is that...
- They surprised us.

121
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,940
Senshi, abstract those things.

122
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,000
- An Ursa?
- Taking it to Iphitos.

123
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,950
For ghost training.

124
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:22,910
You wanna see if you can ghost?

125
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:05,470
Ghosting is when you don't have
a trace of fear in you.

126
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:20,330
Most guys freeze.

127
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:25,340
That's your cerebral cortex
looking for an answer it doesn't have.

128
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,040
See, even your brain
knows you're screwed.

129
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:33,900
Your blood is filling
with adrenaline right now...

130
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,160
...whether you know it or not.

131
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:40,160
Your heart's beating fast.

132
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,380
It's getting a little harder to breath.

133
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:47,590
Your neurobiological system
is telling you to run,

134
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:52,810
but your knees are too weak to move.

135
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:55,740
And it's... too late anyway.

136
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,610
The pores in your skin
have already opened up.

137
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:05,740
It's secrete an imperceptible amount
of pheromones into the air.

138
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:13,790
And all you can think about
is when it gonna kill you.

139
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,330
Senshi.

140
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:22,990
She sees you, kid.

141
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:25,860
Attention on deck.

142
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:30,310
Kitai, back to your seat now.

143
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,940
Rangers, go red-con one.

144
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,590
Secure all cargo.

145
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:41,740
Behind your seat there's a life-suit.

146
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,710
Put it on now. Strap in, full harness.
-Yes, sir.

147
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,100
- Good evening, General.
- Captain.

148
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,860
What's the last known position
of the closest asteroid storm?

149
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:02,700
Category-4 asteroid formation.

150
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,830
2,000km to starboard
and plus 4-5 declination.

151
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,430
I detected graviton-vibrations
in the hull.

152
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,150
Which you detected, how?

153
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,580
Graviton build-up could be
a precursor to mass-expansion.

154
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,320
That storm could be
on us in minutes.

155
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:21,100
But, sir, mass-expansion
is one in a million.

156
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:35,560
What's the last known position
of the closest asteroid storm?

157
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:41,110
...the pull of our own graviton wake
could set the thing off.

158
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:44,399
Let's just hold course and hope I'm wrong.

159
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,470
Just out of interest, sir,

160
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:48,980
How often are you wrong?

161
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:55,950
My wife would give a very
interesting answer to that question.

162
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:58,539
Graviton count's decreasing.

163
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,290
800 parts per million.

164
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:03,390
650.

165
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:05,650
Well, sir,

166
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:11,150
there's a first time for everything.

167
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:38,180
Turn into it.
Match bearing.

168
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,360
Dad.

169
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,580
She's a dead stick.

170
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,770
Engines 1 and 2 are offline. we losing her.

171
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,780
- Can you travel us out of here?
- Where?

172
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,010
The anchorage on Lycia.
It's the closest.

173
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:55,700
Negative, sir. We cannot worm-hole
travel in the middle of this.

174
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,800
Do it.

175
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:04,350
Coordinates for anchorage
at Lycia locked in.

176
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,760
No confirmation signal, sir.

177
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,780
Travel us now.

178
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:14,630
- Sir, without confirmation...
- That's an order.

179
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,500
Go. Go.

180
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,030
Cabin pressure dropping.

181
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:59,100
Heavy damage to outer hall.

182
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:05,500
There's a breach possible to middle cabin.

183
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:13,370
Find me something I can land on. Now.

184
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,020
I got something.

185
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,170
Bearing 340 by 95.

186
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:21,370
Range, 86,000.

187
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,750
Warning: this planet has been
declared unfit for human habitation.

188
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:47,630
Placed under class-1 quarantine
by the interplanetary authority.

189
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,230
Under penalty of law,

190
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:51,020
Do not attempt to land.

191
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,150
Repeat: do not attempt to land.

192
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,950
It's not possible.

193
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:05,490
The computer might have defaulted
back to a known demarcation point.

194
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:08,200
No. Not yet.

195
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,200
- Travel us again.
- Negative, sir.

196
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:16,750
This ship is gonna tear apart
at any moment.

197
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,160
Set her down.

198
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:31,460
Mayday, mayday.
This is Hesper 2-9-9 heavy in distress.

199
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,320
We took heavy damage
from an asteroid storm...

200
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:39,270
...and are going down with bingo power.

201
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,340
You all right?

202
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,640
Evaluate.

203
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,040
Good to go.

204
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:26,220
You confirm the Ursa's contained.

205
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,140
The back of the ship is gone.

206
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,090
Rangers, count off.

207
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:35,670
Rangers, count off.

208
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:41,330
Damn.

209
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:52,920
The cockpit is directly above us.

210
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,020
Go.

211
00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:03,310
Left rear.
There's a utility compartment.

212
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:10,270
Inside,
there's an emergency beacon.

213
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:15,870
Silver. Like a saucer.
Bring it to me.

214
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:54,480
Consolidate inventory up.

215
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,660
General Cypher Raige.

216
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,760
Crash landed.

217
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:32,660
Two confirmed survivors.

218
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,600
Kitai,

219
00:26:56,090 --> 00:27:00,690
the emergency beacon you brought me
will fire a distress signal deep into space.

220
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:03,020
But it's damaged.

221
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:10,770
There's another one
in the tail section of our ship.

222
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:14,050
This is us here.

223
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,560
That, is the tail.

224
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:20,960
Somewhere in this area.

225
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:26,310
It's approximately 100km from here.

226
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:31,290
We need that beacon.

227
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:37,780
- You understand?
- Yeah.

228
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:43,480
Both my legs are broken.
One very badly.

229
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:47,200
You are going to retrieve that beacon,

230
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:50,750
or we are going to die.

231
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:55,820
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

232
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,320
Repeat what I just said.

233
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:03,370
I have to go retrieve the beacon,

234
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:06,860
or we going to die.

235
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:14,250
You have air-filtration inhalers.

236
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:16,630
You need to take one now.

237
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:19,450
The fluid will coat your lungs,
increase your oxygen extraction...

238
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:23,700
...allowing you to breath more
comfortably in the environment.

239
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,650
You have six vials.

240
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,400
In your weight,

241
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:32,590
that should be 20-24 hours
each. That's more than enough.

242
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:35,800
Your life-suit and backpack...

243
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:39,050
...are equipped with
digital and virtual imaging.

244
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,960
So I'll be able to see
everything that you see...

245
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:44,050
...and what you do not see.

246
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:46,700
I will guide you.

247
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:51,950
It'll be like I'm right there with you.

248
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:54,450
Take my cutlass.

249
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,460
It's the C-40.

250
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,600
Full, 22 configurations.

251
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,700
Kitai,

252
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:07,130
every single decision you make
will be life or death.

253
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:09,940
This is a class-1 quarantined planet.

254
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:16,560
Everything in this planet
has evolved to kill humans.

255
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:19,720
Do you know where we are?

256
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:21,820
No, sir.

257
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:25,650
This is Earth.

258
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:45,090
And... the Ursa?

259
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,820
There are three possibilities.

260
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:50,310
First and most likeliest,
it died in the crash.

261
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:51,900
The second and less likely,

262
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,320
is that it is injured very badly
and still contained.

263
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,650
The third and least likely,

264
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,800
is that it is out.

265
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:03,980
We will proceed, however,
in anticipation of the worst case scenario.

266
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:09,430
Every movement will be under
protocol 'escape and evade'.

267
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:11,510
If he's out there,

268
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:14,640
I will see him long before
he gets anywhere near you.

269
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:17,190
Do you understand?

270
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:18,770
Yes, sir.

271
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:22,620
Do exactly as I tell you,

272
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,280
and we will survive.

273
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:24,900
Kitai, calm down.

274
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,360
Take a knee.

275
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:34,070
Root yourself in this present moment, now.

276
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:37,020
Sight, sound.
Smell.

277
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:39,840
What do you feel?

278
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,980
My body feels heavier.

279
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,180
Very good.

280
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,580
Earth gravitational pull
is different than at home.

281
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,510
Very good.

282
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:50,710
Now, let抯 go.

283
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,850
What happened?

284
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:17,390
- You didn't see that?
- Kitai, what happened?

285
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:19,460
I'm fine.

286
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:23,460
No change, I just slipped.

287
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:26,100
There's condensation on the stones.

288
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,450
I'm good to go.

289
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:27,240
General Cypher Raige.

290
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:31,840
Initiating remote probe recon.

291
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,150
Primary target:

292
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,040
Ursa.

293
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,150
I want to reiterate that your navi-band...

294
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:02,060
...is our sole means of communication.

295
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,160
Roger.

296
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:08,630
Temperatures in this planet
fluctuate dangerously, Kitai.

297
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:13,280
And most of the planet
freezes over completely at night.

298
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:15,850
But there are hot spots.

299
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:17,940
Geothermal nodes
between here and the tail...

300
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:22,190
...that will keep you warm
during the freeze-over.

301
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:25,550
You must reach one of these hot spots...

302
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:27,910
...each evening before nightfall.

303
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:31,760
- Is that understood?
- Copy.

304
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:35,740
Standard operating procedure
till I give you further instructions.

305
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,840
Stand by.

306
00:35:05,023 --> 00:35:07,535
---

307
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:17,330
---

308
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:25,680
Dad, are you there?

309
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:32,060
Hey, dad, are you there?

310
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:34,180
Dad?

311
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:36,590
Are you there?

312
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,800
Hello?

313
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:40,780
I'm here.

314
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,180
A boy I know had this.

315
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:51,100
It's a real book.
For a museum.

316
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,750
It's 'Moby-Dick'.

317
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:59,970
He said I can even hold on to it.

318
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:02,620
Hold on, to what?

319
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,020
The book, dad.

320
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:14,720
Do they really kill these whales?

321
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:18,210
We, Senshi, for their oils...

322
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:20,280
...and they almost disappeared.

323
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:22,240
Just before the age of carbon fuels.

324
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:24,400
Where's your brother?

325
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,500
Kit.

326
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:29,770
Hi.

327
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:33,980
Dad, are you there?

328
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:42,570
I'm here.

329
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:19,990
Where are you?

330
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:58,730
My suit turned to black.

331
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:00,540
I like it, but I think it's something bad.

332
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,290
Your suit is made of smart-fabric.

333
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:04,920
It has motion sensors.

334
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:07,910
I'm tracking a life-form
moving towards you from the west.

335
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:10,010
It's closing rapidly.

336
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:12,110
50m.

337
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,210
40.

338
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:17,310
30.

339
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,660
20.

340
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:21,950
10.

341
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:29,150
It is right there, Kitai.

342
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:36,300
Do not... move.

343
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,010
Recognize your power.

344
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:44,160
This will be your creation.

345
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:49,170
Stand down, cadet.

346
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:54,000
- Kitai.
- Go away.

347
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,240
Control yourself, cadet.

348
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:12,780
Kitai.
Stand down.

349
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:15,010
Get away.

350
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:20,000
- Get the hell away.
- Kitai.

351
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:25,480
To your rear.
Out to your rear.

352
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,980
Okay, I'm going.

353
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:34,480
There's a river,
250m straight ahead, go.

354
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,530
They are no longer in pursuit.

355
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:36,170
Cadet, you are not being followed.

356
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:39,930
I repeat, you are not being followed.

357
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:44,350
Kitai, you are running from nothing.

358
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:46,450
Kitai.

359
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:55,220
Kitai, put my damn cutlass away.

360
00:40:55,320 --> 00:41:00,120
You are not being followed.
Take a knee.

361
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:03,070
Take a knee, cadet.

362
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,200
You want to die today,
that's fine,

363
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:14,250
but you are not going to kill me.

364
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:22,960
Kitai, I need you to do
a physical assessment.

365
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:27,360
You are showing rapid blood
contamination. Are you cut?

366
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,400
I'm dizzy.

367
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:31,050
Kitai, self-eval.

368
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:39,290
Good, god.

369
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,870
Dad, I can't stand.

370
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:54,090
Open your med-kit.

371
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:58,140
You are going to have
to administer the antitoxin in sequence.

372
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,480
Inject yourself the clear liquid first.

373
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:02,580
Do it now.

374
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,240
I can't see.

375
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:14,730
The poison is affecting
your nervous system. Stay even.

376
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:18,180
Dad, please come help me.
I can't see.

377
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,740
I can't do this without my sight, dad.
Please, come and get me.

378
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:23,960
Kitai, inject yourself
directly into your heart...

379
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:29,160
...with the first stage.
Do it now.

380
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:44,470
Now the second. ASAP.

381
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,900
To your left, Kitai.

382
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,210
Left.

383
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:53,350
I can't feel my hand.

384
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:55,620
Dad, I can't feel my hands.

385
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:59,470
Press it into the ground.

386
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:07,930
Roll over on it
and press it into the ground, Kitai.

387
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:25,750
Great work, cadet.

388
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:37,910
But you are going to lie there for a moment.

389
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,570
The parasite that stung you...

390
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:46,010
...has a paralyzing agent in its venom.

391
00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:51,570
So you are going to have to
lie there for a little bit.

392
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:56,620
While the antitoxin does its job.

393
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:13,720
It's time to wake up.

394
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:15,900
Son,

395
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,010
the temperature is dropping
five degrees every ten minutes.

396
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:23,710
You have got to wake up.

397
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:28,720
Can you blink your eyes?

398
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,840
Son,

399
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:38,900
I need you to, please,
blink your eyes.

400
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,400
Hey, dad.

401
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:01,620
Hey.

402
00:45:04,982 --> 00:45:05,920
That suck.

403
00:45:06,392 --> 00:45:07,310
<i>That is correct.</i>

404
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:12,880
You got 9.7km to the hot spot.

405
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:17,020
How about you show me that
10k in 50 minutes, cadet?

406
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:19,220
Sir, yes, sir.

407
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:29,350
Two mikes out. All good.

408
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,900
Who wants to be a ranger?
Who wants it?

409
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,570
Watch him go.
Watch him go.

410
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:06,920
Five mikes out.

411
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,900
Come on. Lights out.

412
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,200
Happy 19th birthday, Senshi.

413
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:20,240
Dad, you help me.

414
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:24,280
No, Senshi. You go ahead.
You blow.

415
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:26,560
Come on, dad. Blow.

416
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:29,780
Nah. You know there's no way
I can actually do that from here.

417
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,880
No. I think you can.

418
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:39,640
Faia, you're right there.
Help the girl.

419
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:41,840
You can do it.

420
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:45,090
I love you, dad.

421
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:09,300
Hot spot one arrival:

422
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:12,250
H. plus 54 minutes.

423
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,800
Equipment check and consolidate.

424
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:22,350
Take your next inhaler.

425
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:40,280
Your... oxygen extraction is bottoming.

426
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:51,290
Take your next breathing fluid.

427
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:05,310
Second dose of breathing fluid complete.

428
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:08,410
Count off remaining.

429
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:14,150
Four vials remain, sir.

430
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,560
Repeat.

431
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:36,020
Four vials remain, sir.

432
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:51,180
Dad.

433
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:54,170
Dad.

434
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:58,120
I'm here.

435
00:49:00,050 --> 00:49:02,450
How'd you do it?

436
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:06,860
How'd you first ghost?

437
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:09,180
Out for a run.

438
00:49:10,590 --> 00:49:12,590
Alone.

439
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:17,300
Something that I wasn't supposed to do.

440
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,500
Ursa de-camos,

441
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:22,860
Right in front of me.

442
00:49:22,832 --> 00:49:26,132
I go for my cutlass...

443
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,870
It Shoots its pincer.

444
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:32,120
Right to my shoulder.

445
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:35,290
Next thing I know,
we're over the cliff.

446
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:37,390
Falling.

447
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:41,310
30m. Straight down.

448
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,930
Into the river.

449
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:50,350
We settle onto the bottom.

450
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:54,080
It's on top of me.

451
00:49:56,670 --> 00:50:00,270
But it's stopped moving.

452
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:03,610
And I realize...

453
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:09,040
He's trying to drown me.

454
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:14,630
I'm thinking,
'I'm gonna die.

455
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:17,130
'I'm gonna die.'

456
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:24,300
You cannot believe
this is how you gonna die.

457
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:26,490
I could see my blood bubbling up,

458
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:29,440
Mixing with the sunlight,

459
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:33,440
Shining through the water.

460
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,950
And I'm thinking, 'wow...

461
00:50:39,910 --> 00:50:43,360
'That's really pretty.'

462
00:50:45,010 --> 00:50:48,310
Everything slows down.

463
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:57,110
I see his pincer through my shoulder.

464
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,960
And I decide:

465
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:04,760
I don't want that in there anymore.

466
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:07,410
So I pull it out.

467
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:12,610
And it lets me go.

468
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:17,210
And more than that I can tell...

469
00:51:17,310 --> 00:51:19,860
It can't find me.

470
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:26,150
It doesn't even know where to look.

471
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:30,850
And it dawned on me...

472
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:36,490
Fear is not real.

473
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:41,570
The only place that fear can exist...

474
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:45,710
...is in our thoughts of a future.

475
00:51:45,810 --> 00:51:49,280
It is a product of our imagination.

476
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:52,620
Causing us to fear things
that do not at present...

477
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:56,620
...and may not ever exist.

478
00:51:57,530 --> 00:52:00,760
That is near insanity, Kitai.

479
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:02,800
Now, do not misunderstand me:

480
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:05,880
Danger, is very real.

481
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:09,130
But fear is a choice.

482
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:17,570
We are all telling ourselves a story.

483
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:21,720
And that day, mine changed.

484
00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:38,430
14km to the falls.

485
00:52:38,770 --> 00:52:40,950
That's our midway checkpoint.

486
00:52:41,050 --> 00:52:42,420
I'm reading you.

487
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:44,520
---

488
00:52:44,570 --> 00:52:45,570
---

489
00:53:15,071 --> 00:53:18,671
---

490
00:52:57,639 --> 00:53:01,068
Kitai, get to the falls. ASAP.

491
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,510
I hear something.
I think it's water.

492
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:28,610
A lot of it.

493
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:12,760
Inventory up.

494
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:21,900
Roger.

495
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,580
Food rations, half available.

496
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:24,740
Flares, full.

497
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,830
Med-kit, half-available.

498
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:29,630
Breathing fluid...

499
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:36,410
Breathing fluid,
four vials available.

500
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:42,220
Why you're not showing me the case?

501
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,320
What?

502
00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:48,090
Show it to me now.

503
00:55:05,950 --> 00:55:11,350
I thought that I could make it, sir.

504
00:55:14,141 --> 00:55:21,241
---

505
00:55:24,242 --> 00:55:27,542
---

506
00:55:31,743 --> 00:55:34,743
---

507
00:55:57,370 --> 00:55:59,470
Abort mission.

508
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:03,170
Return to the ship.

509
00:56:03,270 --> 00:56:05,820
That is an order.

510
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:07,910
Don't come out.

511
00:56:08,010 --> 00:56:10,260
No matter what.

512
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:12,960
That's an order.

513
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:20,250
Help.

514
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:22,520
Help.

515
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,320
No, dad.

516
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:30,720
We... I can do it. I can...

517
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:32,850
I don't need many. I can
get across with just two.

518
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:37,530
You need a minimum
of three inhalers to make it to the tail.

519
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:39,950
You have exhausted your resources.

520
00:56:40,050 --> 00:56:42,930
I can get across. I can...
I can do it with just two, dad.

521
00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:46,270
This mission has reached abort criteria.

522
00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:48,960
I'll take full responsibility.

523
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:50,420
You did your best.

524
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,250
You have nothing more to prove.

525
00:56:52,350 --> 00:56:55,950
Now, return to the ship.

526
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,820
What was your mistake?

527
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,920
Trusting me?.

528
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:03,660
Depending on me?
Thinking that I can do this?

529
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:08,000
Now I'm giving you an order...

530
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:10,600
...to turn around...

531
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:14,750
...and return to this ship.

532
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:17,650
You wouldn't give
any other ranger that order.

533
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:20,900
You are not a ranger,

534
00:57:21,110 --> 00:57:25,610
and I'm giving you that order.

535
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:37,920
What was I supposed to do?

536
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:41,650
What did you want me to do?

537
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:43,180
She gave me an order.

538
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:48,730
She said, 'no matter what,
don't come out of that box.'

539
00:57:48,830 --> 00:57:52,010
Was I supposed to just come out and die?

540
00:57:52,110 --> 00:57:55,590
What do you think, cadet?

541
00:57:55,690 --> 00:57:57,710
What do you think you should have done?

542
00:57:57,810 --> 00:57:59,720
Because, really, that is all that matters.

543
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:05,670
What do you think you should have done?

544
00:58:05,710 --> 00:58:07,300
And where were you?.

545
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,760
She called out for you.
She called your name.

546
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:13,940
And you weren't there,
cause you never there.

547
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:18,240
And you think I'm a coward?.

548
00:58:19,290 --> 00:58:23,790
You're wrong.
I'm not a coward.

549
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:26,660
You're the coward.

550
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:30,600
I'm not a coward.

551
00:58:31,670 --> 00:58:33,670
Kitai.

552
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:50,020
Kitai, you've got incoming.

553
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:54,920
Do you copy?
You've got incoming.

554
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:01,720
Don't...

555
00:59:08,270 --> 00:59:10,270
Kitai, dive.

556
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:12,750
Dive.

557
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:38,940
Kitai.

558
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:36,260
No.

559
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:38,910
Leave them alone.

560
01:00:52,450 --> 01:00:54,450
Get away.

561
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:06,160
Dad, I'm sorry, it's just...

562
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:20,050
Where is my son?

563
01:04:10,389 --> 01:04:13,539
General Cypher Raige.

564
01:04:14,180 --> 01:04:18,680
This is a message for my wife.

565
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:21,980
Faia,

566
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:28,790
I have lost contact with our son.

567
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:35,570
End message.

568
01:04:37,270 --> 01:04:39,310
You have six vials.
In your weight,

569
01:04:39,410 --> 01:04:44,250
that should be 20-24 hours
each. That's more than enough.

570
01:04:44,350 --> 01:04:46,760
I estimate four days to reach the tail.

571
01:04:46,860 --> 01:04:48,340
We'll break it to sections.

572
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:51,350
You have six hours to reach
the first geothermal site.

573
01:04:51,450 --> 01:04:54,140
First leg is 20 km. to the
mouth of the north forest.

574
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:55,650
- I'm right here.
- Five mikes out.

575
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:57,460
- Keep moving.
- That's about one hour.

576
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:59,760
Take your next inhaler.

577
01:04:59,860 --> 01:05:01,890
H. plus 54 minutes.

578
01:05:01,990 --> 01:05:03,390
There's an escarpment.

579
01:05:03,490 --> 01:05:05,220
Looks like it could be a waterfall

580
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:06,480
We will call that our midway point.

581
01:05:06,580 --> 01:05:08,350
I can get across.
I can do it with just two, dad.

582
01:05:08,450 --> 01:05:11,120
14km to the forest.
This is us here.

583
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:14,710
That, is the tail.

584
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:18,560
You are going to retrieve that beacon...

585
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:22,560
...or we are going to die.

586
01:05:59,190 --> 01:06:01,440
Leave me alone.

587
01:07:59,420 --> 01:08:01,420
Wake up.

588
01:08:02,220 --> 01:08:06,570
It's time for you to wake up.

589
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:14,500
Hey.

590
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:16,590
Hey.

591
01:08:18,070 --> 01:08:21,180
I was just about to come out that day.

592
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:23,680
No, you weren't.

593
01:08:25,130 --> 01:08:27,690
But you did the right thing.

594
01:08:27,790 --> 01:08:30,620
Dad says I should have tried.

595
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:36,120
He's just mad at himself,
that's all.

596
01:08:40,470 --> 01:08:43,920
Why couldn't you ghost?

597
01:08:49,860 --> 01:08:51,920
You're close right now.

598
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:54,020
I am?

599
01:08:55,660 --> 01:08:57,400
Are you scared?

600
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:59,830
No. I'm tired.

601
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:04,360
That's good.

602
01:09:05,460 --> 01:09:09,410
You filled your heart with something else.

603
01:09:09,510 --> 01:09:11,170
Now you gotta get up.

604
01:09:11,270 --> 01:09:12,760
I memorized some 'Moby-Dick'.

605
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:13,780
Kitai, get up.

606
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:16,190
'All that most maddens and
torments...' -Kitai, wake up.

607
01:09:16,290 --> 01:09:17,840
- All that stirs up the lees of things.'
- Wake up.

608
01:09:17,940 --> 01:09:19,620
- It's time to wake up.
- 'All truth with malice in it.'

609
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:21,810
Kitai. -'All that cracks
the sinews and cakes the brain.'

610
01:09:21,910 --> 01:09:23,910
Wake up.

611
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:03,450
Hey... thanks.

612
01:15:17,158 --> 01:15:19,358
---

613
01:15:29,759 --> 01:15:31,759
No.

614
01:16:10,189 --> 01:16:12,189
Dad.

615
01:16:16,370 --> 01:16:17,820
Dad, it's Kitai.

616
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:20,170
I made it to...

617
01:16:22,380 --> 01:16:29,430
Kitai? -Dad, I made it
to the tail, do you copy?

618
01:16:29,980 --> 01:16:32,380
Kitai, I'm here.

619
01:16:32,590 --> 01:16:37,690
- Are you okay?
- Dad, do you read me?

620
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:40,120
I copy.

621
01:16:40,510 --> 01:16:43,160
Dad, I made it to the tail,
do you copy?

622
01:16:43,260 --> 01:16:46,220
Kitai, we have electrical interference.

623
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:48,170
You're in a black zone.

624
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:52,920
I repeat, you are in a black...

625
01:16:53,050 --> 01:16:59,650
Dad, the Ursa is not contained.
Please, copy.

626
01:17:09,650 --> 01:17:12,070
- Dad?
- I'm here.

627
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:17,810
I swear to you, I'm here.

628
01:17:59,590 --> 01:18:01,590
Take a knee.

629
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:18,740
It is the ionic layer.

630
01:18:18,890 --> 01:18:21,470
And the atmosphere
above your current position,

631
01:18:21,570 --> 01:18:23,420
it is causing electrical interference.

632
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:29,070
That is why the beacon is not firing.

633
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:39,220
To your north.

634
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:40,950
The peak.

635
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:43,130
You must find the beacon...

636
01:18:43,230 --> 01:18:48,330
...from the peak of that mountain.

637
01:18:54,210 --> 01:18:56,310
See it, Kitai.

638
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:01,400
Please.

639
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:04,100
See it.

640
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:20,120
Good boy.

641
01:19:20,310 --> 01:19:22,070
Good boy.

642
01:19:22,170 --> 01:19:24,170
Good boy.

643
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:45,670
It is a pheromone trigger.

644
01:19:45,770 --> 01:19:48,840
He set it to scare you...

645
01:19:48,940 --> 01:19:54,190
...so he can track you.
Keep moving.

646
01:20:14,270 --> 01:20:16,820
It has found you.

647
01:21:08,850 --> 01:21:10,850
Run.

648
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:13,520
Just run, Kitai.

649
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Just run.

650
01:23:05,170 --> 01:23:06,420
---

651
01:23:06,470 --> 01:23:08,370
---

652
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:55,290
Climb in there, okay?
It won't be able to smell you.

653
01:25:56,270 --> 01:25:58,270
Dad.

654
01:26:17,230 --> 01:26:22,160
Root yourself in this present moment, now.

655
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:25,390
Sight, sound.
Smell.

656
01:26:26,180 --> 01:26:28,730
What do you feel?

657
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:42,550
You're still in that box.

658
01:26:42,650 --> 01:26:45,950
It's time to come out.

659
01:30:34,750 --> 01:30:36,220
Stand me up.

660
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:37,950
General.

661
01:30:38,050 --> 01:30:41,350
I said... Stand me up.

662
01:30:54,140 --> 01:30:56,390
Watch his back.

663
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:21,400
Dad?

664
01:31:22,580 --> 01:31:24,580
Yeah.

665
01:31:26,360 --> 01:31:29,460
I wanna work with mom.

666
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:31,560
Yep.

667
01:31:32,470 --> 01:31:34,470
Me too.
