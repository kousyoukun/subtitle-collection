1
00:01:21,265 --> 00:01:22,596
One

2
00:01:22,633 --> 00:01:24,066
between the eyes!

3
00:01:24,101 --> 00:01:26,228
Two

4
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:28,363
between the eyes.

5
00:01:57,334 --> 00:01:59,131
– Out!
– What?

6
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,473
– She was safe.
– She was out.

7
00:02:04,508 --> 00:02:06,442
She landed right there.
She's safe.

8
00:02:09,079 --> 00:02:10,740
Aw, come on.

9
00:02:10,781 --> 00:02:13,443
That's enough.
I don't want to hear another word.

10
00:02:13,484 --> 00:02:15,748
– You're gone!
– Yeah, I'm gone.

11
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,286
My grandmother used to take me
to Washington Square Park...

12
00:02:28,132 --> 00:02:30,600
to watch Bobby Fischer
play 10 games at the same time.

13
00:02:30,634 --> 00:02:32,693
Queen me.

14
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:35,671
He was five-six moves ahead
on each table.

15
00:02:36,673 --> 00:02:39,164
Anyway, he became
the world champ, didn't he?

16
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:41,234
Then he lost his fucking mind.

17
00:02:44,548 --> 00:02:47,210
He became a raving paranoid.

18
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:48,980
Being attacked
from all directions,

19
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:51,044
he couldn't see
what was in front of him.

20
00:02:58,162 --> 00:03:00,357
Mate. Mate!

21
00:03:30,727 --> 00:03:33,252
My name is David Fisk,

22
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:35,458
Detective First Grade.

23
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:39,534
I've been a cop in the NYPD
for over 30 years.

24
00:03:40,871 --> 00:03:43,203
In that time...

25
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:47,276
I've killed 14 people.

26
00:03:49,179 --> 00:03:51,170
Run that by me
one more time.

27
00:03:52,182 --> 00:03:54,742
I've killed 14 people.

28
00:03:54,785 --> 00:03:56,446
He's nuts.

29
00:03:58,922 --> 00:04:01,152
When did
these things start?

30
00:04:05,262 --> 00:04:07,423
How did they start?

31
00:04:12,536 --> 00:04:15,801
Maybe this one started
with a guy named Charles Randall.

32
00:04:21,411 --> 00:04:24,346
Randall was a child killer.

33
00:04:26,116 --> 00:04:28,482
He killed his girlfriend's daughter

34
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:30,953
about four years ago.

35
00:04:32,289 --> 00:04:34,314
Fuck you, damn asshole.

36
00:04:35,592 --> 00:04:37,219
He was tried
for the crime,

37
00:04:37,261 --> 00:04:39,729
but was acquitted
by a jury of his peers.

38
00:04:54,244 --> 00:04:57,372
My partner and I
found this unacceptable.

39
00:05:01,151 --> 00:05:04,120
My partner is a good man.

40
00:05:25,142 --> 00:05:27,736
Are you really
gonna do this thing?

41
00:05:27,778 --> 00:05:29,803
Do what?

42
00:05:29,846 --> 00:05:32,280
You're going to
take down Randall

43
00:05:32,316 --> 00:05:34,477
for a homicide
he didn't commit.

44
00:05:39,356 --> 00:05:41,688
What am I gonna do?

45
00:05:41,725 --> 00:05:43,716
You're my partner.

46
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,160
– You're my role model.
– Right.

47
00:05:46,196 --> 00:05:48,187
What am I gonna do
without a role model?

48
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:54,400
We didn't have
this conversation.

49
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:56,929
What conversation?

50
00:06:16,059 --> 00:06:17,822
It got done.

51
00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:25,159
Randall lost his freedom

52
00:06:25,202 --> 00:06:27,170
for the crime he didn't commit.

53
00:06:33,043 --> 00:06:35,102
I lost my faith.

54
00:06:37,781 --> 00:06:40,306
– I'm gonna go.
– Okay.

55
00:06:50,227 --> 00:06:50,427
You can take this
as a confession if you want.

56
00:06:50,427 --> 00:06:53,362
You can take this
as a confession if you want.

57
00:06:53,397 --> 00:06:55,388
Whatever.

58
00:06:55,432 --> 00:06:58,230
A few weeks ago
things heated up.

59
00:06:58,268 --> 00:07:00,031
What do we got on him, Turk?

60
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:04,473
Marcus Smith, AKA Spider...
big big dope deals,

61
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:06,942
murders, extortion,
lots of nice things.

62
00:07:06,977 --> 00:07:09,309
He converted
this old abandoned bank

63
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:11,473
into Club 404 of Harlem.

64
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:13,142
Maybe when he sees us
he'll confess.

65
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:15,151
What, you don't believe
in miracles?

66
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,777
When you pick up a check
one day...

67
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,152
one day,
then I'll believe in miracles.

68
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:22,317
– Let's go. I'm buying.
– Yeah, that's a miracle I want to see.

69
00:07:26,396 --> 00:07:28,990
♪ We fly high, no lie ♪

70
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:32,001
♪ You hear that?
You know this, balling ♪

71
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:35,004
♪ Foreign rides outside ♪

72
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:37,097
♪ It's like showbiz,
we in the building ♪

73
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,335
♪ We stay fly, no lie... ♪

74
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:41,139
This is where he launders
his money.

75
00:07:41,178 --> 00:07:45,137
Oh, yeah,
cleaning green green green.

76
00:07:45,182 --> 00:07:47,377
He's all business.

77
00:07:48,785 --> 00:07:50,616
I gotta take a leak.

78
00:08:00,363 --> 00:08:02,524
Oh, I'll just be a sec.

79
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:04,033
I'm not peeking.

80
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:06,467
No problem.

81
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:13,532
– You guys are so lucky.
– Why is that?

82
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:15,875
No line to the bathroom and...

83
00:08:17,814 --> 00:08:20,044
you get to pee standing up.

84
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,914
Unzip, psss, zip.

85
00:08:21,952 --> 00:08:24,216
Badda boom badda bing,
you're out of here.

86
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:28,657
Yeah, the big guy really outdid himself
on this thing.

87
00:08:28,692 --> 00:08:30,057
You want a bump?

88
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:32,027
Where did you get that from?

89
00:08:32,062 --> 00:08:34,496
Spider. Supremo.

90
00:09:42,933 --> 00:09:44,924
Not bad.

91
00:09:44,968 --> 00:09:48,233
Not bad?
What the fuck were you looking for?

92
00:09:48,271 --> 00:09:50,671
Come on, Turk,

93
00:09:50,707 --> 00:09:52,698
you pulled my hair.

94
00:09:52,742 --> 00:09:55,939
Gee, my little sister used to
pull my hair harder than that.

95
00:09:55,979 --> 00:09:57,173
Whatever.

96
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,444
I gotta go.

97
00:10:14,598 --> 00:10:16,896
– Where the fuck are you going?
– I'm tired.

98
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:19,595
You're tired?
It's America, you whiny bitch.

99
00:10:19,636 --> 00:10:22,469
Why don't you fucking get in the cab
and do some honest work?

100
00:10:22,505 --> 00:10:25,372
Yeah, she's on her way.
She can't wait to see you.

101
00:10:25,408 --> 00:10:28,673
Rambo the Skateboard Pimp
was my 10th kill.

102
00:10:30,814 --> 00:10:34,511
Think of me as a street-sweeper.

103
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:36,644
I cleaned up this worthless
piece of shit

104
00:10:36,686 --> 00:10:39,712
and left an obituary of sorts.
It rhymes.

105
00:10:48,598 --> 00:10:50,964
Rooster, we gotta find out
who did this.

106
00:10:51,001 --> 00:10:52,866
Give him a medal.

107
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:55,736
Hey, Rambo, you see
who did this?

108
00:10:55,772 --> 00:10:57,740
He ain't talking, eh?

109
00:10:57,774 --> 00:10:59,969
Real name Robert Brady.

110
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:02,001
Bobby Brady. Damn shame.

111
00:11:02,045 --> 00:11:03,876
What are you thinking?
Marcia? Greg?

112
00:11:05,382 --> 00:11:07,373
You guys messing up
my crime scene again?

113
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,544
You don't know
who Bobby Brady is?

114
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,577
Yeah, we met about an hour ago.

115
00:11:11,621 --> 00:11:14,385
– It looks like close range.
– From the stippling around the wound

116
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:16,051
I'd say two to three feet away.

117
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,822
We'll be fishing fragments
out of his brains.

118
00:11:18,862 --> 00:11:20,921
– What?
– No, I just got that...

119
00:11:20,964 --> 00:11:23,057
"Marcia? Greg?"
That's a good one, Rooster.

120
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,828
Well, that was quick.

121
00:11:24,868 --> 00:11:26,699
Just trying to keep pace with you.

122
00:11:30,874 --> 00:11:34,002
"He trades in sin,
distributes flesh.

123
00:11:34,044 --> 00:11:36,410
He picks the fruit
when it is fresh.

124
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:39,574
Now someone else
must slap his whore.

125
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:44,349
His heart has stopped.
He breathes no more."

126
00:11:46,222 --> 00:11:48,247
What do you want to do
about this?

127
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:51,089
I say let's make the best of it,

128
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:54,255
canvass the hookers.
Maybe we'll meet one you like.

129
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:57,926
Please. I got all I can handle
from you-know-who.

130
00:11:57,968 --> 00:11:59,765
No shit?

131
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:02,897
She's got my sperm level so low
I gotta sit down to take a piss.

132
00:12:02,939 --> 00:12:04,600
Oh, thanks for that picture.

133
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,905
Hey, what can I tell you?

134
00:12:06,943 --> 00:12:09,707
How can I help you, gentlemen?

135
00:12:09,746 --> 00:12:11,771
We'd like to talk to you
about your boss.

136
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:14,079
He's upstairs.

137
00:12:14,117 --> 00:12:16,449
No, your other boss.

138
00:12:20,256 --> 00:12:22,247
Rambo.

139
00:12:22,292 --> 00:12:24,226
He is asshole.

140
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:27,423
Why "he is asshole"?

141
00:12:27,464 --> 00:12:29,864
Follow me, please.

142
00:12:34,637 --> 00:12:36,264
You know anybody
who'd want to kill him?

143
00:12:36,306 --> 00:12:37,967
Me.

144
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:39,305
Anyone else?

145
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,333
Why? He's dead?

146
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:45,604
Hey, listen, you want to smarten up
and help us out

147
00:12:45,648 --> 00:12:47,343
or am I gonna have to call
somebody at ICE

148
00:12:47,384 --> 00:12:49,147
and have you on the next plane
to kielbasa-land?

149
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,016
Go ahead.

150
00:12:51,054 --> 00:12:52,954
I am American citizen.

151
00:12:52,989 --> 00:12:55,048
Yeah.

152
00:12:55,091 --> 00:12:57,150
Lick my balls anytime.

153
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,785
What?

154
00:12:58,828 --> 00:13:00,819
Call us anytime, you know,

155
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:03,264
if you hear something, anything.

156
00:13:05,635 --> 00:13:08,468
I think we're looking
for a guy named Sam the Butcher.

157
00:13:08,505 --> 00:13:10,973
Who?

158
00:13:11,007 --> 00:13:13,271
Nah, he's kidding around.
But seriously, Lieutenant,

159
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:15,334
how far do you want us to go
with this Rambo murder?

160
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:17,846
I don't know, I was thinking maybe
you could investigate it a bit more,

161
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:20,281
figure out who did it,
try to put him in jail.

162
00:13:20,316 --> 00:13:23,183
That is, if it doesn't get in the way
of your shuffleboard lessons.

163
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,743
Yeah, no problem.

164
00:13:24,788 --> 00:13:27,655
We're also working this dealer Spider
who's tied to these two stiffs

165
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:28,987
we found on Fresh Kills.

166
00:13:32,295 --> 00:13:35,196
If we can nail him, who knows
how far up the ladder it will lead?

167
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,357
So what about it?

168
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,094
I popped this lawyer
with an ounce of blow.

169
00:13:38,134 --> 00:13:40,500
She practically shoved it up my nose.
I got her to flip on him.

170
00:13:40,537 --> 00:13:42,198
Lucky fuck, eh?

171
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,865
She scored it from him directly?

172
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:46,205
– Yeah, she did.
– Good.

173
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:49,939
Okay, well, get what you can out of her
and kick her loose.

174
00:13:49,979 --> 00:13:52,415
I hate trying to prosecute
fucking lawyers.

175
00:14:01,157 --> 00:14:03,387
– This isn't Spider's club.
– The back way in.

176
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:07,453
Yeah, it's an abandoned
linen factory, Jessica.

177
00:14:07,497 --> 00:14:10,432
I guess I'm not your average...

178
00:14:10,467 --> 00:14:11,957
what do you call it?

179
00:14:12,001 --> 00:14:13,992
– Rat?
– Stoolie?

180
00:14:14,037 --> 00:14:16,028
Thanks.

181
00:14:16,072 --> 00:14:19,769
I mean, I think usually
it's some poor African-American kid

182
00:14:19,809 --> 00:14:22,039
or a junkie or a prostitute.

183
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:24,638
Well, normally 200-grand-a-year
corporate lawyers

184
00:14:24,681 --> 00:14:27,616
are much smarter than your average
African-American junkie whore...

185
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:30,278
normally, but sometimes
they only think they are.

186
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,187
It's all set
on this end.

187
00:14:33,223 --> 00:14:34,884
Are you guys sure
it's safe in there?

188
00:14:34,924 --> 00:14:37,984
You tell your girlfriend
to grow a pair and let's go.

189
00:14:38,027 --> 00:14:41,087
What do you say, Counsel?
Are you ready to do this thing?

190
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:43,793
Yeah, let's get it over with.

191
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:46,802
Okay, remember what we said?
You go in there,

192
00:14:46,836 --> 00:14:50,237
you wait for him to ask you
for what you need, right?

193
00:14:50,273 --> 00:14:52,901
And then you don't come back here
with less than four ounces.

194
00:14:52,942 --> 00:14:54,409
– Four ounces?
– Yeah.

195
00:14:54,444 --> 00:14:57,106
Isn't that a lot? I, like, buy a couple
of balls at the club, that's it.

196
00:14:57,147 --> 00:15:00,116
You just say you're going skiing and
you need a week's worth of fresh powder.

197
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,482
Yeah, you tell him you're going
on vacation.

198
00:15:05,388 --> 00:15:09,119
I do this thing
and my record's wiped clean?

199
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:10,456
As a whistle.

200
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:12,461
No one at my law firm will know
that I got busted, right?

201
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:14,019
It never happened.

202
00:15:15,131 --> 00:15:17,429
Look, Counsel, we all know you
better than this.

203
00:15:17,467 --> 00:15:20,061
You just do this, you stop
shoving that shit up your nose,

204
00:15:20,103 --> 00:15:21,866
you go home, you get married,
you have kids,

205
00:15:21,905 --> 00:15:24,567
you never come back here,
and that's that.

206
00:15:26,075 --> 00:15:28,407
Yeah.

207
00:15:28,444 --> 00:15:31,277
Everybody's in position.

208
00:15:31,314 --> 00:15:33,782
Okay, we're going.
Yes, sir.

209
00:15:36,085 --> 00:15:38,747
Let's push the signal
back 50%.

210
00:15:39,756 --> 00:15:41,781
Hey, Jessica.

211
00:15:41,824 --> 00:15:43,291
Break a leg.

212
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:48,020
It's two flights down.

213
00:15:48,064 --> 00:15:50,430
The door's on the left.
Ring the bell.

214
00:15:57,473 --> 00:15:59,941
Hey, Stubby, why don't you
go and escort our company up here?

215
00:16:01,744 --> 00:16:03,769
Go on, fat boy.

216
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,174
Get it on.

217
00:16:16,793 --> 00:16:19,489
– Good afternoon.
– Hey, Spider.

218
00:16:19,529 --> 00:16:22,020
– I'll be downstairs.
– All right.

219
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:24,090
– How are you?
– All right, baby,

220
00:16:24,133 --> 00:16:26,499
just checking out this wizard shit
before I let my kids watch it.

221
00:16:26,536 --> 00:16:29,004
– You seen this?
– No.

222
00:16:29,038 --> 00:16:31,506
The guy is a stone dealer.
I let my little ones watch this...

223
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:33,805
they'll all turn out junkies.
You know what I'm saying?

224
00:16:33,843 --> 00:16:35,333
He's got a point.

225
00:16:35,378 --> 00:16:37,573
– You remember Underdog?
– What about him?

226
00:16:37,614 --> 00:16:40,549
That fucking dog spawned
a generation of junkies.

227
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:44,417
So you converted the bank
into a club and a recording studio?

228
00:16:44,454 --> 00:16:47,014
– Yeah. You like it?
– Yeah.

229
00:16:47,056 --> 00:16:48,956
What are you talking about?

230
00:16:48,992 --> 00:16:50,721
What did Underdog do
all the time?

231
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,455
He was always shining shoes

232
00:16:52,495 --> 00:16:54,656
and whenever Sweet Polly Purebred
would call out to him,

233
00:16:54,697 --> 00:16:56,665
his dog ears would pick it up
and he'd rescue her.

234
00:16:56,699 --> 00:16:59,167
Yeah, but what did he do
when he needed his super strength?

235
00:16:59,202 --> 00:17:01,363
He'd go to his ring, remember?

236
00:17:01,404 --> 00:17:03,269
Pull out a pill, pop it.

237
00:17:03,306 --> 00:17:06,798
Holy shit, you're right.
He was a little fucking speed freak.

238
00:17:06,843 --> 00:17:08,174
So what's the business?

239
00:17:08,211 --> 00:17:11,044
How about a QP?
You're good for a QP.

240
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,741
The fuck you want with QP?

241
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:15,410
I'm going skiing with friends,

242
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,011
a lot of friends.

243
00:17:18,054 --> 00:17:20,488
– Where?
– Aspen, Colorado.

244
00:17:20,523 --> 00:17:23,253
Shit. I'm sure you can
score one in Aspen.

245
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:25,284
Not your primo brand.

246
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:27,729
You ski?

247
00:17:27,764 --> 00:17:29,254
Sure. My whole life.

248
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:32,427
Come on, I don't have all day.

249
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,800
Why don't you put down your jacket,
stay a little while?

250
00:17:34,837 --> 00:17:36,031
What do you think?

251
00:17:36,072 --> 00:17:37,630
Actually,
I've got to run.

252
00:17:37,674 --> 00:17:41,576
I have a major IPO
closing in an hour, so...

253
00:17:41,611 --> 00:17:44,341
You know, stress will kill you.
You gotta chill out.

254
00:17:45,715 --> 00:17:47,649
I'm as chill as I get.

255
00:17:47,684 --> 00:17:49,675
What do you want to do?

256
00:17:53,022 --> 00:17:55,422
You know, every once in a while...

257
00:17:57,593 --> 00:17:59,652
one of you Upper East Side bitches
gets popped,

258
00:17:59,696 --> 00:18:01,687
tries to to roll over
on a nigga like me.

259
00:18:01,731 --> 00:18:03,824
You're scared now.

260
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:11,097
Looks like the cavalry
come to rescue you.

261
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,630
Can I help you, gentlemen?

262
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:14,108
Yeah, let us in, Spider.

263
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:16,338
I'm sorry, there's no one here
by that name.

264
00:18:16,379 --> 00:18:19,280
– Let us in.
– We only want to talk to you.

265
00:18:21,984 --> 00:18:24,885
See, I know how to look
and I know where to look.

266
00:18:30,827 --> 00:18:32,795
Come to papa.

267
00:18:34,497 --> 00:18:36,158
It always hurts the first time.

268
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,797
You all right?

269
00:18:38,835 --> 00:18:40,632
Why wouldn't she be all right?
We're watching TV.

270
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:42,331
How the fuck is she gonna get hurt
watching TV?

271
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:44,966
She could have seen or heard
something that scared her.

272
00:18:45,007 --> 00:18:46,907
– Like what?
– Like some big fucking mutt

273
00:18:46,943 --> 00:18:48,467
shooting his bug fat
fucking mouth off.

274
00:18:48,511 --> 00:18:51,378
Wasn't nobody here fitting that description
till a minute ago.

275
00:18:51,414 --> 00:18:53,314
I'm gonna show you ugly,
you fucking mother...

276
00:18:53,349 --> 00:18:55,817
– We've said enough.
– Oh, you finna bring your wife up in here?

277
00:18:55,852 --> 00:18:58,912
That's it. That's it.
Let's go. It's okay.

278
00:18:58,955 --> 00:19:01,685
– You okay?
– Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.

279
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:03,692
You want your wire back?

280
00:19:05,294 --> 00:19:07,159
Firearm!

281
00:19:07,196 --> 00:19:08,288
No, Stubby, no!

282
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:18,904
Get down.
Get the fuck down!

283
00:19:28,684 --> 00:19:30,151
Come on.

284
00:19:30,186 --> 00:19:32,984
The fat one's dead.

285
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:43,497
Well, that went well.

286
00:19:45,368 --> 00:19:47,268
Oh, shit, you're bleeding.

287
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:51,365
3-4 squad, Central.
11-41, request ambulance.

288
00:19:51,407 --> 00:19:54,205
I need EMS. Subject shot,
184th and St. Nicholas.

289
00:19:54,243 --> 00:19:56,438
Really, I tried my best.

290
00:19:56,479 --> 00:19:59,778
You're doing just fine, Counsel.
You're doing just fine. Just relax.

291
00:19:59,816 --> 00:20:02,910
Hey, guys, if you ever
need a lawyer...

292
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:05,682
Yeah, okay.

293
00:20:05,721 --> 00:20:08,189
You bet.

294
00:20:10,927 --> 00:20:13,157
In good old days
we used to

295
00:20:13,196 --> 00:20:15,926
let the perp bleed out
and call off the ambulance.

296
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:17,899
– Calm calm calm.
– Fucking lowlife.

297
00:20:17,934 --> 00:20:19,731
You made your point.
You made your point.

298
00:20:19,769 --> 00:20:22,067
Tough little bitch, ain't you,
kicking a man while he's handcuffed?

299
00:20:22,104 --> 00:20:24,595
Shut the fuck up,
you piece of shit.

300
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,267
You think I won't blow
your fucking head off?

301
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:28,072
I wouldn't think twice
about it.

302
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:30,374
I'd go in there,
get the fat boy's gun,

303
00:20:30,413 --> 00:20:34,076
come back here
and put two between your eyes.

304
00:20:38,888 --> 00:20:40,879
Where's EMS?

305
00:20:40,923 --> 00:20:44,120
This thing was a clusterfuck
to end all clusterfucks.

306
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,718
You got nothing.

307
00:20:45,761 --> 00:20:47,729
How about felony murder?

308
00:20:47,763 --> 00:20:50,254
No drugs, right?
So no predicate felony,

309
00:20:50,299 --> 00:20:52,199
no conspiracy,
no nothing.

310
00:20:52,235 --> 00:20:54,260
No felony. No felony.
I can't believe this.

311
00:20:54,303 --> 00:20:56,032
No felony.
How do you spell felony?

312
00:20:56,072 --> 00:20:59,405
Homicide, racketeering, drugs...
I mean, what are we talking about?

313
00:20:59,442 --> 00:21:02,070
Hey, you're lucky
that white girl didn't die.

314
00:21:02,111 --> 00:21:04,011
IAB is gonna interview
both of you

315
00:21:04,046 --> 00:21:06,514
and do a preliminary report
over the next couple of weeks.

316
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:10,041
Now off the record
you actually didn't violate procedure

317
00:21:10,086 --> 00:21:12,520
because the victim had a firearm
aimed at you,

318
00:21:12,555 --> 00:21:14,785
so if you stick together
you should make it through this.

319
00:21:14,824 --> 00:21:16,815
You'd better get
your story straight too,

320
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:19,692
'cause I'm not going back to Far Rockaway
because you two fucked up.

321
00:21:19,729 --> 00:21:22,323
And you're gonna spend some couch time
with the rubber-gun squad.

322
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:26,165
And you'd better take this shrink seriously
or you'll be off active duty.

323
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:27,965
That fucking piece of shit
just walks.

324
00:21:28,004 --> 00:21:29,801
Knock it off, Turk.

325
00:21:32,308 --> 00:21:34,936
Relax, partner.
He's gonna get his.

326
00:21:34,977 --> 00:21:37,502
Gentlemen, your questions.

327
00:21:37,547 --> 00:21:39,947
– Who made the decision to enter?
– I did.

328
00:21:39,982 --> 00:21:41,973
– Whose decision was it to enter?
– Mine.

329
00:21:42,018 --> 00:21:44,316
Did you immediately identify yourselves
as police officers?

330
00:21:44,353 --> 00:21:46,651
– Yes, we did.
– Did you immediately identify yourselves?

331
00:21:46,689 --> 00:21:49,180
The informant's position
was becoming untenable.

332
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:51,489
– We were afraid she was in danger.
– Turns out you were right.

333
00:21:51,527 --> 00:21:54,018
– No fucking kidding, nine-to-fiver.
– Excuse me, Detective?

334
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:56,463
Are you finished
with my client?

335
00:21:58,434 --> 00:22:02,393
– They're like Lennon and McCartney.
– Not an inch of daylight between them.

336
00:22:02,438 --> 00:22:03,666
What do you think?

337
00:22:03,706 --> 00:22:05,003
Nothing there.

338
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:07,908
They endangered the informant.
We can't make them wrong on that.

339
00:22:07,944 --> 00:22:09,571
They saw a gun, they reacted.

340
00:22:09,612 --> 00:22:11,375
They beat the fuck
out of the suspect,

341
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:13,507
but he's not filing charges.

342
00:22:13,549 --> 00:22:15,608
Let's see what the shrink says.

343
00:22:16,619 --> 00:22:19,019
So what are we gonna
do now, Doc?

344
00:22:19,055 --> 00:22:21,250
Are we gonna find out
if I'm sane enough

345
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:24,020
to carry a gun,
chase bad guys?

346
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:26,654
Okay, why did you become a cop?

347
00:22:26,696 --> 00:22:29,426
Well, it was New Year's Eve.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

348
00:22:29,465 --> 00:22:33,367
I didn't have the same opportunities
you had, Dr. Prosky.

349
00:22:33,402 --> 00:22:36,098
Where I come from
it was either a gun and a badge

350
00:22:36,138 --> 00:22:38,003
or a hard hat and a hammer.

351
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,508
How do you feel
when you fire your weapon?

352
00:22:40,543 --> 00:22:43,273
It's like Dirty Harry said...
"There's nothing wrong

353
00:22:43,312 --> 00:22:45,940
with a little shooting as long as
the right people get shot."

354
00:22:45,982 --> 00:22:47,916
And when the wrong people
get shot?

355
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:50,919
It sucks, but I'd rather be in it
that out of it.

356
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:53,046
There's nothing worse
than being stuck on a bench.

357
00:22:53,089 --> 00:22:55,319
How do you feel when you see
innocent people get killed?

358
00:22:55,358 --> 00:22:57,588
You know...

359
00:22:59,362 --> 00:23:02,559
I sort of get numb to it.

360
00:23:02,598 --> 00:23:05,260
Here.

361
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:06,791
I want you to take this.

362
00:23:06,836 --> 00:23:10,203
Use it to jot down your thoughts,
your questions,

363
00:23:10,239 --> 00:23:12,730
anything you may have noticed
about yourself,

364
00:23:12,775 --> 00:23:14,242
whatever.

365
00:23:14,276 --> 00:23:16,107
I won't ask for it.

366
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:18,909
Just for you.

367
00:23:18,948 --> 00:23:20,438
I want you to try it.

368
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:22,508
Sounds like fun.

369
00:23:24,387 --> 00:23:27,948
Harder.

370
00:23:42,638 --> 00:23:43,969
Go, Turk, go!

371
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:48,401
You got third.
Go go!

372
00:23:48,444 --> 00:23:51,140
Yeah!
Look at that.

373
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,546
You own it. You own it.

374
00:23:53,582 --> 00:23:55,447
No matter what they say
about you,

375
00:23:55,484 --> 00:23:57,577
you're tremendous!

376
00:23:59,655 --> 00:24:01,987
Go go, Turk, go!

377
00:24:03,826 --> 00:24:05,919
Safe.
You dropped the ball.

378
00:24:05,961 --> 00:24:08,293
– A fucking cheap shot, man.
– Get away from the bag.

379
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:11,265
– Or what? Or what? Or what?
– Watch the bag.

380
00:24:22,912 --> 00:24:25,346
The NYPD is bubbling
with frustration,

381
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:26,973
hostility and testosterone,

382
00:24:27,016 --> 00:24:29,007
ready to erupt
at any moment.

383
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:31,076
Think of me
as the release valve.

384
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,953
One flick of the trigger
and the pressure goes down.

385
00:24:33,989 --> 00:24:36,082
You know why
you join the force?

386
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:38,218
To get respect.

387
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,989
Most people respect the badge.

388
00:24:40,029 --> 00:24:42,361
Everybody respects the gun.

389
00:24:47,803 --> 00:24:49,794
Hey, Riley, I was talking to JD...

390
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:52,899
you guys caught a stiff named
Phillip Trager, a gun-runner?

391
00:24:52,942 --> 00:24:55,172
Oh, yeah, a real piece of shit.

392
00:24:55,211 --> 00:24:57,145
– How did that go down?
– I don't know.

393
00:24:57,179 --> 00:24:59,443
Somebody gave him a taste
of his own medicine, I guess,

394
00:24:59,482 --> 00:25:01,882
walked right into his apartment,
killed him with one of his own guns.

395
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:04,181
Did the shooter leave a note
or anything?

396
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:07,189
Yeah, actually,
the shooter left a poem.

397
00:25:10,292 --> 00:25:12,817
He did?
No shit.

398
00:25:12,862 --> 00:25:14,853
Yeah. Hey, Simon,

399
00:25:14,897 --> 00:25:18,333
you remember that poem
from the Trager case?

400
00:25:20,336 --> 00:25:22,395
What are you doing, man?

401
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:24,429
Turk's asking about it.

402
00:25:24,473 --> 00:25:26,941
What the hell are you doing?

403
00:25:26,976 --> 00:25:29,410
¿ Qué mierda 'tas haciendo ahí, papá?

404
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,379
No le digas mierda a eso loco.

405
00:25:31,413 --> 00:25:35,042
Cálmate. He wants to hear
about the poem.

406
00:25:35,084 --> 00:25:37,314
"Merchant of thieving class,

407
00:25:37,353 --> 00:25:40,481
I slit his throat
and capped his ass.

408
00:25:40,523 --> 00:25:41,990
I took his gun, I took his...

409
00:25:42,024 --> 00:25:45,016
I took his life, I took his gun,
But too bad he's not the only one."

410
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:47,119
That's how it goes,
something like that.

411
00:25:47,163 --> 00:25:49,461
It's not iambic pentameter,
but it rhymes.

412
00:25:49,498 --> 00:25:51,489
– Rooster.
– Yo.

413
00:25:52,501 --> 00:25:54,401
We're looking for the same guy.

414
00:25:54,436 --> 00:25:57,599
He knocked off a pimp named Rambo
a few weeks ago. When was yours?

415
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,165
Last week. We're running ours with the ATF
because of the guns.

416
00:26:00,209 --> 00:26:03,269
We're back in business on the Rambo case.
Looks like the same guy knocked off

417
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:05,746
– a gun dealer on the three-three last week.
– No shit.

418
00:26:05,781 --> 00:26:08,750
– What do you mean? That's our case.
– That's our case. You're taking our case.

419
00:26:08,784 --> 00:26:11,252
Seniority, guys.
Tag along, you'll learn something.

420
00:26:11,287 --> 00:26:13,448
Oh, tell me the guy's name
is Greg Brady.

421
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:15,457
Please. It is, isn't it?

422
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:18,051
Oh, somebody's knocking off
the Brady Bunch.

423
00:26:18,093 --> 00:26:21,961
Gotta be the Partridge Family.

424
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:25,057
Trager,
a gun-runner bites the dust...

425
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,159
number 11.

426
00:26:35,544 --> 00:26:39,344
The bullet matched the.45
in Trager's apartment.

427
00:26:39,381 --> 00:26:41,849
That was no surprise.
So I ran it through ATF.

428
00:26:41,884 --> 00:26:44,910
It's one of a batch of six
that was stolen from a gun shop

429
00:26:44,954 --> 00:26:47,252
– in Virginia last month.
– Yeah, probably by Trager.

430
00:26:47,289 --> 00:26:49,985
That's what they think.
He matches the description they have.

431
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:52,721
It still doesn't help us find the guy.
It just helps us tie him to the victims,

432
00:26:52,761 --> 00:26:55,252
which he's already doing
with his little fucking poems.

433
00:26:55,297 --> 00:26:58,357
Excuse me. Hello.

434
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,631
Hey, Turk, don't forget
we got a court date later.

435
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:04,833
So...

436
00:27:04,874 --> 00:27:08,503
I heard he kicked the shit
out of that dealer you guys took down.

437
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:10,375
Spider.

438
00:27:10,412 --> 00:27:11,572
So?

439
00:27:13,249 --> 00:27:15,740
Did he?

440
00:27:18,587 --> 00:27:21,215
Yeah, he got him
down on the ground.

441
00:27:21,257 --> 00:27:23,657
The guy was handcuffed.

442
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:27,754
And he just started
kicking him in the gut.

443
00:27:27,796 --> 00:27:30,196
And then

444
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:32,564
he gets down on the guy's chest

445
00:27:32,601 --> 00:27:35,934
and he really starts smacking him

446
00:27:35,971 --> 00:27:38,906
hard in the face over and over

447
00:27:38,941 --> 00:27:40,932
and screaming at the top
of his lungs,

448
00:27:40,976 --> 00:27:43,240
"I'm gonna break
your fucking face,

449
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,679
you little bitch!"

450
00:27:45,714 --> 00:27:48,046
Then his eyes really started
to fill up.

451
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,074
I mean, they get dark...

452
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:52,280
you know how he gets
the sort of rage in him.

453
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:56,084
I thought he was gonna
kill this guy.

454
00:27:57,459 --> 00:27:59,927
Really?

455
00:28:02,631 --> 00:28:05,031
You're a bad little girl.

456
00:28:05,067 --> 00:28:06,932
Hmm?

457
00:28:06,969 --> 00:28:10,029
– I got work to do.
– You bet.

458
00:28:12,007 --> 00:28:15,408
Counselor,
my hands are tied here.

459
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:17,435
Without a secure
chain of custody,

460
00:28:17,479 --> 00:28:20,209
any evidence obtained
after the initial search

461
00:28:20,249 --> 00:28:22,717
– must be excluded.
– You gotta be fucking kidding me.

462
00:28:22,751 --> 00:28:25,117
Therefore I am forced
to grant defense

463
00:28:25,154 --> 00:28:27,452
motion to dismiss
all charges

464
00:28:27,489 --> 00:28:29,684
of rape and assault
against Mr. Van Luytens.

465
00:28:29,725 --> 00:28:31,716
– Your Honor.
You think I want this guy

466
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,921
going anywhere
near my daughter,

467
00:28:33,963 --> 00:28:36,124
or anyone's daughter
for that matter?

468
00:28:36,165 --> 00:28:38,633
You messed up.
I am unleashing your client

469
00:28:38,667 --> 00:28:40,931
unto the world.
I'm sure we'll all be

470
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:42,403
back here again very soon.

471
00:28:42,438 --> 00:28:45,430
Look at him.
Look at this motherfucker.

472
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:49,069
Hey, it's gonna come back to you, mutt.
You're gonna get it.

473
00:28:49,111 --> 00:28:51,545
– When you walk outside watch your back.
– Easy, Turk.

474
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,740
Order in my court.

475
00:28:52,781 --> 00:28:56,046
– Okay, mutt? You fucking mutt.
– Not here, not now.

476
00:28:56,085 --> 00:28:58,519
Not here, not now.
Will you get him out of here

477
00:28:58,554 --> 00:29:01,114
before somebody passes a sentence
on him you can't appeal?

478
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,384
Order!

479
00:29:02,424 --> 00:29:05,552
– You know what I mean? Go go.
– Order, Detective.

480
00:29:05,594 --> 00:29:09,553
Dr. Prosky suggested
that I free-associate.

481
00:29:09,598 --> 00:29:11,998
So here I go.

482
00:29:12,034 --> 00:29:14,662
You know what I think about
when I pull a trigger?

483
00:29:14,703 --> 00:29:17,638
I think about the Infield Fly Rule.

484
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:20,699
I love that fucking rule.
It assumes the worst in everybody.

485
00:29:20,743 --> 00:29:24,440
It says, "Sorry, batter, you're a schmuck
for popping up with runners on.

486
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,880
And you, stupid-ass infielder,
you don't get to cheat

487
00:29:26,915 --> 00:29:29,349
and drop the ball just because
you caught a break."

488
00:29:29,385 --> 00:29:31,046
My favorite part...
the batter's out

489
00:29:31,086 --> 00:29:33,247
but the runners advance
at their own risk.

490
00:29:33,288 --> 00:29:35,552
Well, isn't this
a pleasant surprise?

491
00:29:35,591 --> 00:29:37,684
That's the way
life should be.

492
00:29:37,726 --> 00:29:39,717
You can be a motherfucker
at your own risk.

493
00:29:43,032 --> 00:29:46,866
Or not.
Van Luytens... one less rapist.

494
00:29:46,902 --> 00:29:49,132
Who's gonna miss him?
Nobody.

495
00:29:49,171 --> 00:29:51,332
Number 12 and counting.

496
00:30:05,587 --> 00:30:07,487
Whoa whoa, hot coffee.

497
00:30:07,523 --> 00:30:09,218
– Good morning, Detective Riley.
– Hey, good morning.

498
00:30:09,258 --> 00:30:11,226
– Door on your left.
– Any signs of forced entry?

499
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,955
Doesn't look like it.
Detective Perez is in there.

500
00:30:12,995 --> 00:30:14,394
He's in there already?
All right.

501
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:16,557
– Hey, how about those Mets last night?
– Yeah, how about 'em?

502
00:30:16,598 --> 00:30:18,657
Hey, Teddy, Teddy, come here,
check this out.

503
00:30:20,069 --> 00:30:22,435
Wow.

504
00:30:22,471 --> 00:30:23,699
Fuck.

505
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:26,537
– Oh my God.
– That's big.

506
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:28,566
And powerful.

507
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:31,477
– What, a plasma screen?
– LCD.

508
00:30:31,513 --> 00:30:33,572
– That's plasma.
– No, it's got to be LCD.

509
00:30:33,615 --> 00:30:35,913
It wouldn't be that big.
– Hey, guys, guys.

510
00:30:35,951 --> 00:30:39,387
He was shot at close range,
dropped right here.

511
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:42,185
The pussy doesn't look like he put up
much of a fight, does he, Karen?

512
00:30:42,224 --> 00:30:44,283
Nothing to indicate that

513
00:30:44,326 --> 00:30:47,853
in terms of struggle.
No forced entry, cuts, bruises.

514
00:30:47,896 --> 00:30:51,127
Hey, nobody wants to hear
about your private life, Officer Corelli.

515
00:30:51,166 --> 00:30:54,397
That's detective to you,
Officer Needledick.

516
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:56,370
– Ooh.
Ouch.

517
00:30:56,405 --> 00:30:58,737
– Looks like it's our guy again.
– Who did you get this time?

518
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:00,435
This is Jonathan Van Luytens.

519
00:31:00,476 --> 00:31:02,410
He owns a couple
of car dealerships.

520
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:04,776
– Oh, shit.
– He was up on rape charges,

521
00:31:04,813 --> 00:31:07,008
but they got tossed out
last week.

522
00:31:07,049 --> 00:31:09,040
Look at this.

523
00:31:09,084 --> 00:31:13,180
"A man devoid of all respect,
Of beauty, charm or intellect,

524
00:31:13,222 --> 00:31:15,656
He took what women
would not give.

525
00:31:15,691 --> 00:31:17,625
He didn't have
the right to live."

526
00:31:17,659 --> 00:31:20,025
That's our boy all right.

527
00:31:20,062 --> 00:31:23,225
Looks like he had a beef
with our old pal Jonny.

528
00:31:23,265 --> 00:31:24,357
You know him?

529
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:26,264
Yeah.

530
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:28,599
He's one slippery
son of a bitch, let me tell you.

531
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:31,340
Yeah.

532
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:34,468
You guys know how much
fun it is to not catch a serial killer?

533
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:36,239
You got a point here, Lieutenant?

534
00:31:36,278 --> 00:31:38,041
The point is

535
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,207
you'd better both
think seriously

536
00:31:40,249 --> 00:31:42,342
about whether or not
you want the lead on this case.

537
00:31:42,384 --> 00:31:44,045
You don't think
we're up to this?

538
00:31:45,053 --> 00:31:48,250
Come on, you got what,

539
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:50,986
about 110 years on the job
between the two of you?

540
00:31:51,026 --> 00:31:54,086
120.

541
00:31:54,129 --> 00:31:56,393
I'm telling you, you screw it up
badly enough,

542
00:31:56,431 --> 00:31:58,626
they may try to fuck you
out of your pension.

543
00:31:58,667 --> 00:31:59,895
You want to risk that?

544
00:31:59,935 --> 00:32:01,766
– Yeah.
– Fuck, yeah.

545
00:32:01,803 --> 00:32:06,763
406, Lieutenant. 406.

546
00:32:06,808 --> 00:32:09,402
Okay, 406...
what does that mean?

547
00:32:09,444 --> 00:32:10,968
Ted Williams.

548
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:14,073
Ted Williams, the last day of the season,
is batting 400.

549
00:32:14,116 --> 00:32:17,210
Sox manager wants to bench him,
protect his average, right?

550
00:32:17,252 --> 00:32:19,049
Williams plays
both games anyway,

551
00:32:19,087 --> 00:32:21,055
goes six for eight,
ends up at 406...

552
00:32:21,089 --> 00:32:22,784
the last guy that ever hit
over 400.

553
00:32:22,824 --> 00:32:25,315
Okay, fine. It's all yours.

554
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,386
Just don't go moaning to me
when some traffic cop

555
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:30,728
pulls your serial killer over
for speeding

556
00:32:30,766 --> 00:32:33,394
and he grabs your
15 minutes of fame and you realize

557
00:32:33,435 --> 00:32:36,598
the asshole could have been
standing right there in front of you

558
00:32:36,638 --> 00:32:39,698
and it would have taken you
1000 light years to nail him.

559
00:32:39,741 --> 00:32:41,470
Not for nothing, Lieutenant,

560
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:44,570
light years measures distance,
not time.

561
00:32:46,982 --> 00:32:49,450
Well, thank you, Detective.
I'll make a note of that.

562
00:32:49,484 --> 00:32:52,317
Ellis Lynde, 2003.

563
00:32:52,354 --> 00:32:55,118
This guy had a history
of cruising gay bars,

564
00:32:55,157 --> 00:32:57,955
picking up twinkies,
beating the shit out of them.

565
00:32:57,993 --> 00:33:00,894
Lynde was found shot dead
in his apartment.

566
00:33:00,929 --> 00:33:03,830
Whoever's doing this
gets up real close to the guys,

567
00:33:03,865 --> 00:33:06,527
blows their brains out
without any trouble,

568
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:08,058
leaves no fingerprints

569
00:33:08,103 --> 00:33:09,900
and obviously
takes pride in his work.

570
00:33:09,938 --> 00:33:14,238
Okay, what could be
murder number two back from '04,

571
00:33:14,276 --> 00:33:15,709
one Matthew Mitrella.

572
00:33:20,682 --> 00:33:22,809
I was shaking
the first couple of times

573
00:33:22,851 --> 00:33:25,684
I killed in cold blood.

574
00:33:25,721 --> 00:33:29,054
I kept thinking if I got caught
they'd kick me off the force.

575
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:31,719
I wasn't worried about prison,
but losing the gun and the shield...

576
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,988
that scared me.

577
00:33:33,028 --> 00:33:35,519
I went into work the next day
expecting to feel different.

578
00:33:35,564 --> 00:33:38,658
I thought everybody would look at me
the way cops look at civilians

579
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,930
and know which ones are dirty.

580
00:33:47,909 --> 00:33:50,241
But they didn't.
That's when I knew

581
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:52,873
I could keep on
doing this forever.

582
00:33:56,018 --> 00:33:59,954
So next stop... Spider.

583
00:33:59,988 --> 00:34:01,979
If we shut down his business,

584
00:34:02,024 --> 00:34:04,015
maybe he'd be a rat.

585
00:34:04,059 --> 00:34:06,050
We got a lawyer.

586
00:34:06,094 --> 00:34:09,860
We needed her to testify
that she bought coke from him.

587
00:34:09,898 --> 00:34:12,458
She was a good lawyer.

588
00:34:12,501 --> 00:34:16,961
Me and my partner paid a visit
to Club 404 of Harlem.

589
00:34:17,005 --> 00:34:18,131
A word about him...

590
00:34:18,173 --> 00:34:21,267
Tom Cowen's been my partner
for almost 30 years.

591
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:23,244
He's the best cop
I've ever seen.

592
00:34:25,147 --> 00:34:28,674
I'm always the one
following him through the door.

593
00:34:28,717 --> 00:34:30,878
There's a bullet
that was meant for me

594
00:34:30,919 --> 00:34:34,480
that's lodged in his torso.

595
00:34:34,523 --> 00:34:36,582
He was my role model.

596
00:34:36,625 --> 00:34:38,991
The day I stopped
trying to be Tom Cowen

597
00:34:39,027 --> 00:34:41,495
was the greatest day
of my life.

598
00:34:55,344 --> 00:34:58,336
Hey, Rooster,

599
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:01,406
I was going through the files
on poetry boy.

600
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:03,680
That's an interesting way
to pass your time.

601
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:06,153
Okay, there was a gun

602
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:08,349
found on Charles Randall
when he was arrested.

603
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:09,618
Yeah.

604
00:35:09,658 --> 00:35:12,821
Now in all the other shootings
the gun was left at the scene,

605
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:16,024
but there are a lot of similarities.
So I mentioned it to Perez and Riley.

606
00:35:16,064 --> 00:35:18,123
I think somebody should go
interview him in prison.

607
00:35:18,166 --> 00:35:20,794
I think there may be a connection.

608
00:35:20,836 --> 00:35:24,294
That's a good idea,
but not Perez and Riley.

609
00:35:24,339 --> 00:35:26,773
I mean, not those guys.
They'll screw it up.

610
00:35:26,808 --> 00:35:28,935
This is too important.

611
00:35:28,977 --> 00:35:31,445
Turk and I will handle Randall, okay?

612
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,038
Good work.

613
00:36:04,479 --> 00:36:06,845
Detectives, Charles Randall.

614
00:36:08,683 --> 00:36:11,811
What the fuck
do you two scumbags want?

615
00:36:11,853 --> 00:36:14,549
What a greeting.

616
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:17,649
You like poetry, Chuck?

617
00:36:17,692 --> 00:36:18,750
What?

618
00:36:18,794 --> 00:36:21,991
Do you like poetry?

619
00:36:23,031 --> 00:36:26,728
Yeah.
Roses are red, violets are blue,

620
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:29,703
I want to poke out your fucking eyes
with my dick, you fuck.

621
00:36:29,738 --> 00:36:31,729
How's that?

622
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:34,401
I thought you'd rhyme.
You didn't.

623
00:36:34,443 --> 00:36:36,604
Fuck you.
Fuck both of you.

624
00:36:36,645 --> 00:36:38,272
Get me out of here.

625
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:50,554
Why the fuck did we even bother
going out there?

626
00:36:50,592 --> 00:36:52,685
What would it look like
if we didn't go?

627
00:36:54,429 --> 00:36:56,624
Are you gonna relax?

628
00:36:56,665 --> 00:36:58,656
Relax.

629
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,600
Yeah, I'll just take it out
on Karen later.

630
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,933
The more I'm with her,
the more abuse she wants.

631
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:04,233
Sounds like fun.

632
00:37:04,272 --> 00:37:05,864
Hey, you want to take her
off my hands?

633
00:37:05,907 --> 00:37:10,367
Be careful, partner, because I have
a very special effect on women.

634
00:37:10,412 --> 00:37:11,606
Go wild.

635
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,045
Whatever.

636
00:37:13,081 --> 00:37:16,073
I can't believe I had to face
that piece of shit and look like an idiot.

637
00:37:16,117 --> 00:37:19,416
Eh, fuck him.
He's where he belongs.

638
00:37:19,454 --> 00:37:21,081
I'm sorry, partner,
I'm really sorry.

639
00:37:21,122 --> 00:37:24,057
Stop worrying about it.

640
00:37:25,894 --> 00:37:29,591
Whatever happens,
I'm not taking you down with me.

641
00:37:29,631 --> 00:37:32,600
Don't worry about me.
I'm all right, believe me.

642
00:37:32,634 --> 00:37:35,899
I don't know what I was thinking.
I just don't know what I was thinking.

643
00:37:35,937 --> 00:37:38,269
You know what you was thinking?
You were thinking

644
00:37:38,306 --> 00:37:40,968
about a 10-year-old girl
who had her skull crushed.

645
00:37:41,977 --> 00:37:44,445
Yeah, I tried to stop you,
but you know what?

646
00:37:44,479 --> 00:37:48,745
I admired you that day,
what you did.

647
00:37:48,783 --> 00:37:51,752
That was righteous.

648
00:37:51,786 --> 00:37:55,620
And you don't second-guess yourself
on something like that.

649
00:38:02,631 --> 00:38:04,622
Okay, I'm the killer.

650
00:38:04,666 --> 00:38:07,191
I'm the killer.
I show up at your door

651
00:38:07,235 --> 00:38:09,226
or your car window,

652
00:38:09,271 --> 00:38:11,569
and for some reason
you open your door,

653
00:38:11,606 --> 00:38:14,541
you roll down
your car window for me.

654
00:38:14,576 --> 00:38:16,771
So who am I?

655
00:38:16,811 --> 00:38:19,177
Someone I know.

656
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:20,704
Maybe a nice set of tits.

657
00:38:20,749 --> 00:38:22,842
And the poems?
What about the poems?

658
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:25,250
You have to compose the poem
before you got there, right?

659
00:38:25,287 --> 00:38:27,278
Otherwise what, you're gonna
blow out the guy's brains,

660
00:38:27,322 --> 00:38:29,187
sit down and write a little sonnet
for yourself?

661
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:30,623
No prints on the poems,

662
00:38:30,659 --> 00:38:33,651
so probably
I wore gloves when I wrote it.

663
00:38:33,695 --> 00:38:36,755
You obviously know your victims.
Between that and the easy access,

664
00:38:36,798 --> 00:38:39,130
I guess that they know you too.
They must.

665
00:38:39,167 --> 00:38:41,601
These guys are all scumbags.
They're not gonna trust anyone,

666
00:38:41,636 --> 00:38:44,196
open the door for anyone,
especially if they don't know them.

667
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:46,571
Yeah, but I more than know them.

668
00:38:46,608 --> 00:38:48,940
I know everything about them.
I know their moves,

669
00:38:48,977 --> 00:38:50,842
their patterns,
I know their schedules.

670
00:38:50,879 --> 00:38:53,677
Okay, so you're following them.
You're staking them out.

671
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:09,522
Anyone gonna say it?

672
00:39:09,564 --> 00:39:11,498
What?

673
00:39:14,002 --> 00:39:16,664
Fuck me.

674
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:20,205
– He's right, it's a cop.
– No.

675
00:39:20,241 --> 00:39:22,539
Let's slow down, fellows.
We're getting way ahead of ourselves.

676
00:39:22,577 --> 00:39:26,172
– Come on, it's a cop, you know it.
– I don't know shit. Neither do you.

677
00:39:26,214 --> 00:39:29,081
I'm telling your right now,
it's a cop, it's a cop, it's a cop.

678
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:30,812
What do you mean,
"It's a cop, it's a cop, it's a cop"?

679
00:39:30,852 --> 00:39:34,117
– Where do you come off saying it's a cop?
– Easy, partner, he's just saying it.

680
00:39:34,155 --> 00:39:36,783
– What are you talking about?
– He's just saying...

681
00:39:36,825 --> 00:39:40,124
I know, I know, I know
what he's saying.

682
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:43,559
And I'm saying it's bullshit.

683
00:39:44,566 --> 00:39:47,535
Shoot me. What the fuck?
But don't say it's a cop.

684
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,871

689
00:40:06,755 --> 00:40:08,746
So what about dinner?

690
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:10,382
You feel like going out?

691
00:40:10,425 --> 00:40:12,222
Where?

692
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:14,125
I don't care.
You're the one going.

693
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:15,993
What is your problem?

694
00:40:16,031 --> 00:40:18,022
No problem.

695
00:40:18,066 --> 00:40:20,193
If you feel like hanging around,
be my guest.

696
00:40:20,235 --> 00:40:21,566
I don't feel like going out.

697
00:40:21,603 --> 00:40:24,766
Fine, just don't bug me.

698
00:40:24,806 --> 00:40:28,936
This is the best part of my day
and I don't need you fucking it up.

699
00:40:30,745 --> 00:40:33,737
So you only fuck cops?

700
00:40:33,782 --> 00:40:36,649
Once in a while
I do a fireman or an ex-con.

701
00:40:38,586 --> 00:40:40,247
You lump us in together?

702
00:40:40,288 --> 00:40:42,415
Well, I have some respect
for firemen.

703
00:40:42,457 --> 00:40:44,254
Fuck you.

704
00:40:44,292 --> 00:40:46,226
You know why they take away
your nightstick

705
00:40:46,261 --> 00:40:48,491
– when you hang up your uniform?
– No.

706
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:50,725
They don't trust you with it.

707
00:40:50,765 --> 00:40:52,926
Right now I wouldn't trust
myself with it either.

708
00:40:52,967 --> 00:40:54,992
Shit, you'd probably love that.

709
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:56,697
Too bad you never met
Van Luytens.

710
00:40:56,738 --> 00:40:58,433
You two really would have
hit it off great.

711
00:40:58,473 --> 00:41:00,634
At least somebody finally
brought some justice down

712
00:41:00,675 --> 00:41:02,506
on that dickless little fuck.

713
00:41:02,544 --> 00:41:04,842
Now that is who I'd like to meet.

714
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,779
Well, maybe you'll get
your wish one day.

715
00:41:06,815 --> 00:41:08,646
They think it's a cop.

716
00:41:08,683 --> 00:41:10,310
– Makes sense.
– Bullshit.

717
00:41:10,351 --> 00:41:12,342
It's just some fucking psychopath.

718
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:14,719
Well, there's plenty of those
on the job.

719
00:41:23,164 --> 00:41:24,722
– Are you sleeping well?
– Not really.

720
00:41:24,766 --> 00:41:26,290
– Yep.
– Eating well?

721
00:41:26,334 --> 00:41:27,801
– No.
– Yeah.

722
00:41:27,836 --> 00:41:29,030
Any recurring nightmares?

723
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:31,561
Yeah, that I'm stuck
in a room with you forever.

724
00:41:32,774 --> 00:41:34,139
Nope.

725
00:41:34,175 --> 00:41:35,972
Do you think you're fit
to return to duty?

726
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:38,001
– Abso-fucking-lutely.
– Yeah.

727
00:41:38,046 --> 00:41:41,174
– You ever think about retiring?
– You mean, death with benefits?

728
00:41:41,216 --> 00:41:43,013
What's not to like?

729
00:41:43,051 --> 00:41:45,019
– You ever think about retiring?
– Not really.

730
00:41:45,053 --> 00:41:47,044
What have I got to look forward to?

731
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:49,283
Sailing my 26-footer
around Sheepshead Bay,

732
00:41:49,324 --> 00:41:50,757
umpiring cops' softball?

733
00:41:50,792 --> 00:41:52,885
– How about corporate security work?
– It's too dangerous.

734
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:56,192
– So what are you gonna do?
– Maybe I'll buy a boat.

735
00:41:56,231 --> 00:41:57,265
All right, look,
I don't know if I believe this,

736
00:41:57,265 --> 00:41:58,323
All right, look,
I don't know if I believe this,

737
00:41:58,366 --> 00:42:00,129
but I'm just gonna
throw it out there.

738
00:42:00,168 --> 00:42:02,500
You guys say we're looking
for one of our own,

739
00:42:02,537 --> 00:42:06,496
but what if it was an ex-cop,
somebody with an axe to grind?

740
00:42:06,541 --> 00:42:08,202
You got one in mind?

741
00:42:08,243 --> 00:42:11,371
He's thinking about Martin Baum

742
00:42:11,412 --> 00:42:14,176
our old lieutenant.

743
00:42:14,215 --> 00:42:16,581
So what's the story with him?

744
00:42:16,618 --> 00:42:18,609
He got fired a few years ago.

745
00:42:18,653 --> 00:42:21,850
I'm not saying there's any motive,
but he knew all the victims.

746
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:25,451
Yeah, but Turk,
I knew most of those guys.

747
00:42:25,493 --> 00:42:28,656
So did you, Riley, Perez.
Even Karen knew 'em.

748
00:42:28,696 --> 00:42:30,755
– I'm just throwing it out there.
– Well, maybe you killed 'em.

749
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:34,098
Yeah, maybe I did.

750
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:36,296
The poems and the placement
of the weapons

751
00:42:36,337 --> 00:42:38,134
are all we've got
linking the kills,

752
00:42:38,173 --> 00:42:40,869
which means what we gotta do now
is get humping on the forensics.

753
00:42:40,909 --> 00:42:43,275
That shouldn't be
too much of a problem.

754
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:45,302
We already got the girl
working on that.

755
00:42:45,346 --> 00:42:49,112
That's right, Karen's been
humping on it all week, as we speak.

756
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,618
What did you say?

757
00:42:51,653 --> 00:42:52,915
Here we go again.

758
00:42:52,954 --> 00:42:54,717
– You should watch your mouth.
– Oh, yeah?

759
00:42:54,756 --> 00:42:57,224
He didn't mean anything by it.
Karen and him are ancient history.

760
00:42:57,258 --> 00:42:59,419
– College boy can't speak for himself?
– Yeah, I can speak for myself.

761
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:01,257
Let me speak for myself...
fuck you, Turk.

762
00:43:01,296 --> 00:43:03,264
Mutt, I'm gonna hit you
on the head with this barbell.

763
00:43:03,298 --> 00:43:05,391
I'm not better than you.
You're not better than me, man.

764
00:43:05,433 --> 00:43:07,128
You put your balls
in your pocket.

765
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:08,829
And you, fellow officers,

766
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:13,068
a little courtesy
for a fellow professional, you know?

767
00:43:13,107 --> 00:43:16,133
Please. Are we gonna move on
here now?

768
00:43:16,177 --> 00:43:18,168
What are we doing?
Where were we?

769
00:43:18,213 --> 00:43:21,774
Talking about Martin Baum.
What's his story?

770
00:43:21,816 --> 00:43:24,307
Some guys under him
got caught taking money.

771
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:26,616
Baum stood up for them,
tried to cover it up.

772
00:43:26,654 --> 00:43:29,054
He do time?

773
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:31,923
Well, they pressed charges,
but he plead out and resigned.

774
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,951
So what's his beef with you?

775
00:43:33,995 --> 00:43:35,826
I could have lied to protect him,
but I didn't.

776
00:43:35,864 --> 00:43:38,856
Okay, but if he's got a beef with you,
why not go after you?

777
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:41,391
Why not kill you? Why go around
acting like a serial killer,

778
00:43:41,436 --> 00:43:43,301
killing all these degenerates?
It doesn't make any sense.

779
00:43:43,338 --> 00:43:45,772
– I'm just telling you.
– I'm telling you it doesn't make sense.

780
00:43:45,807 --> 00:43:47,866
I'm throwing it out there.
I'm saying this is what it is.

781
00:43:47,909 --> 00:43:50,002
You want to check him out or not?
I don't give a shit.

782
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:52,569
– It doesn't make any sense.
– You're the ones that think it's a cop.

783
00:43:52,614 --> 00:43:54,548
I'm just saying here's a cop
with a chip on his shoulder.

784
00:43:54,582 --> 00:43:56,573
Check him out if you want.
I don't give a shit.

785
00:43:56,618 --> 00:43:59,951
Calm down and give a better reason
why Baum could be a suspect, okay?

786
00:44:01,789 --> 00:44:04,223
PMS, gotta be.

787
00:44:10,999 --> 00:44:13,900
– Hey, guys.
– What's going on?

788
00:44:13,935 --> 00:44:16,335
I came over to bring you
the FBI report

789
00:44:16,371 --> 00:44:18,339
on the paper
and handwriting.

790
00:44:18,373 --> 00:44:20,500
You don't have a problem
with me looking over the evidence

791
00:44:20,541 --> 00:44:22,975
that I collected and processed
for you, do you?

792
00:44:23,011 --> 00:44:24,911
– No problem.
– Put it back, Karen.

793
00:44:24,946 --> 00:44:26,937
– This is fascinating.
– Let's go, come on.

794
00:44:26,981 --> 00:44:28,949
Come on, let's go, let's go.

795
00:44:28,983 --> 00:44:30,780
– What?
– Come on, let's go.

796
00:44:30,818 --> 00:44:32,843
Get your hands off me.

797
00:44:32,887 --> 00:44:35,117
I'll give you a little privacy.
I don't want to interrupt anything here.

798
00:44:35,156 --> 00:44:36,953
Are you afraid of me
looking at your old case files?

799
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:39,459
– Is that it?
– Okay, I'm gone. Enjoy.

800
00:44:39,494 --> 00:44:41,485
– What?
– What is it with you?

801
00:44:41,529 --> 00:44:43,554
What is it with you?

802
00:44:46,901 --> 00:44:50,359
I'm sorry about last night, okay?

803
00:44:50,405 --> 00:44:53,067
I really am. It's a habit.

804
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:56,008
Habits can be broken, right?

805
00:44:56,044 --> 00:44:57,443
That's bullshit.

806
00:44:57,478 --> 00:44:58,740
No.

807
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:01,248
I'm totally serious, all right?

808
00:45:02,717 --> 00:45:05,015
It's not bullshit,

809
00:45:05,053 --> 00:45:07,044
really.

810
00:45:13,728 --> 00:45:16,196
Why do you think
Turk was so quick to take the lead

811
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:19,131
on the poetry case, huh?
To keep us from finding the killer, man.

812
00:45:19,167 --> 00:45:21,533
That's what I would do
if I was covering my tracks.

813
00:45:21,569 --> 00:45:24,504
He sticks us on this Baum stakeout
'cause it's more misdirection.

814
00:45:24,539 --> 00:45:25,699
Makes sense.

815
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:27,935
I hate that Turk, man.

816
00:45:56,604 --> 00:45:58,595
Hey, he's coming out.
He's coming out.

817
00:46:00,842 --> 00:46:03,174
Oh, at 2:45 in the morning.

818
00:46:06,447 --> 00:46:09,905
Is it killing time
or is he just killing time?

819
00:46:29,537 --> 00:46:32,028
Come on, Baum,
go kill someone already.

820
00:46:32,073 --> 00:46:34,598
Yeah, kill Turk, man.
He's the one setting you up.

821
00:46:34,642 --> 00:46:36,109
Do us all a favor.

822
00:46:41,249 --> 00:46:43,740
Hey, did you see Turk's
marksmanship scores?

823
00:46:43,785 --> 00:46:45,343
Did you see this?
It's ridiculous.

824
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:47,286
Service... 99,
70 out of 100.

825
00:46:47,321 --> 00:46:50,757
Combat Association awards,
department commendations.

826
00:46:50,792 --> 00:46:53,192
This guy could take out your left nut
at 50 yards.

827
00:46:56,464 --> 00:46:58,489
Did you see the computer
trajectories, man?

828
00:46:58,533 --> 00:46:59,966
Not one stray slug.

829
00:47:00,001 --> 00:47:02,333
Even Berkowitz put a couple
in the Corinthian leather.

830
00:47:07,475 --> 00:47:09,943
What about Karen?
She come up with anything new?

831
00:47:09,977 --> 00:47:11,842
No, not yet.

832
00:47:11,879 --> 00:47:13,847
If Baum kills somebody
I don't want us to be in the car

833
00:47:13,881 --> 00:47:16,247
waiting when it happens, okay?

834
00:47:18,086 --> 00:47:19,747
I'll go.

835
00:47:19,787 --> 00:47:21,778
Attaboy, Teddy, attaboy.

836
00:47:21,823 --> 00:47:23,188
I'm proud of you, son.

837
00:47:34,402 --> 00:47:36,563
You're Perez, right?

838
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:37,935
Yeah.

839
00:47:37,972 --> 00:47:39,667
I'm Martin Baum.

840
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:45,404
I got a permit for this.

841
00:47:45,446 --> 00:47:48,176
I work security
in the diamond district.

842
00:47:48,216 --> 00:47:51,014
So you figure it's a cop
doing the poetry killings?

843
00:47:51,052 --> 00:47:53,919
Someone says, "Check out Baum.
He thinks he got a raw deal."

844
00:47:53,955 --> 00:47:56,389
That's what passes
for police work these days?

845
00:47:56,424 --> 00:47:57,914
Do you think
you got a raw deal?

846
00:47:57,959 --> 00:47:59,824
Damn straight.

847
00:47:59,861 --> 00:48:02,193
– Life sucks.
– Yeah.

848
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:04,790
– Everything okay, Simon?
– Teddy, where the fuck were you, man?

849
00:48:04,832 --> 00:48:07,130
Anything else you want to tell us,
Lieutenant Baum?

850
00:48:07,168 --> 00:48:11,070
– I got something for you in my pocket.
– Huh-uh!

851
00:48:12,607 --> 00:48:17,340
A passport, credit card receipts,
boarding passes.

852
00:48:17,378 --> 00:48:19,369
The day Brady was killed

853
00:48:19,413 --> 00:48:21,582
I was escorting a client
to Brazil.

854
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,014
Judgment is
the dominion of the Lord.

855
00:48:29,056 --> 00:48:31,957
And if this person,
this worthless rapist

856
00:48:31,993 --> 00:48:34,518
or murderer,
as you describe him,

857
00:48:34,562 --> 00:48:37,963
if he is truly repentant
and seeks absolution,

858
00:48:37,999 --> 00:48:40,365
it must be granted to him.

859
00:48:40,401 --> 00:48:42,835
Your name doesn't ring a bell,

860
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:47,136
but I've had so many
altar boys over the years.

861
00:48:51,245 --> 00:48:53,236
So many altar boys

862
00:48:53,281 --> 00:48:55,977
that it's hard to remember
their names.

863
00:48:56,017 --> 00:48:59,077
My name is David Fisk,
Detective First Grade.

864
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:01,384
You may not
remember me now,

865
00:49:01,422 --> 00:49:04,585
but I guarantee you'll remember my name
for the rest of your life.

866
00:49:04,625 --> 00:49:08,493
Father Connell,
may he rot in hell.

867
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:10,997
13 down, one to go.

868
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:23,035
White underwear
below the knee.

869
00:49:23,077 --> 00:49:25,545
Briefs-style.

870
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:28,014
Large tweezers.

871
00:49:28,049 --> 00:49:31,507
I am removing a card that has been
inserted in the rectum of the deceased

872
00:49:31,552 --> 00:49:35,579
and placing it
in a plastic evidence bag.

873
00:49:38,292 --> 00:49:42,023
– I'll be right back.
– All right.

874
00:49:43,698 --> 00:49:46,326
Hey. It's another one,

875
00:49:46,367 --> 00:49:48,562
handwritten.

876
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:54,603
"The old man
who the children trust,

877
00:49:54,642 --> 00:49:58,271
Unable to control his lust,

878
00:49:58,312 --> 00:50:01,213
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

879
00:50:01,249 --> 00:50:05,310
The church can't stop him.
Someone must."

880
00:50:06,687 --> 00:50:08,678
I'll see what else I can find.

881
00:50:14,262 --> 00:50:16,526
What's the matter with you?

882
00:50:16,564 --> 00:50:18,862
Father Connell gave me
my first communion

883
00:50:18,899 --> 00:50:21,663
back in Bensonhurst.

884
00:50:24,038 --> 00:50:26,529
Hey, guys.
Sorry we didn't get a chance to call.

885
00:50:26,574 --> 00:50:29,634
– Yeah, I bet you are.
– Go over there, take a look around.

886
00:50:29,677 --> 00:50:31,804
We'll compare notes later, okay?

887
00:50:31,846 --> 00:50:34,974
Looks like our friend just settled
an old score with the priest,

888
00:50:35,016 --> 00:50:37,007
left him with his pants down.

889
00:50:37,051 --> 00:50:38,678
– Come on.
– No, look.

890
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:40,186
Come on, don't talk like that.

891
00:50:40,221 --> 00:50:42,189
– Hey, look for yourself.
– Have a little respect.

892
00:50:43,724 --> 00:50:46,921
Next thing they're gonna tell us
Lieutenant Baum was an altar boy here.

893
00:50:46,961 --> 00:50:50,397
Tell me about it.
These two guys fucking stink.

894
00:50:50,431 --> 00:50:52,763
Look, Doctor,
you read the poems.

895
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,030
It is possible, right,
that this guy is a cop?

896
00:50:55,069 --> 00:50:57,435
I've never seen it.

897
00:50:57,471 --> 00:51:00,269
I've never even heard
about a cop serial killer.

898
00:51:00,308 --> 00:51:02,469
Come on, girls,
let's go, let's go.

899
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:07,436
Yeah. Go go go go go
go go go go!

900
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:08,505
Safe.

901
00:51:08,549 --> 00:51:11,017
Doc, give us a tip.
How are we gonna catch this guy?

902
00:51:11,052 --> 00:51:13,043
You don't have to worry
about that.

903
00:51:13,087 --> 00:51:14,748
He wants to get caught.

904
00:51:17,058 --> 00:51:19,720
You don't have any better place
to have lunch?

905
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,557
I wanted to thank you.

906
00:51:21,595 --> 00:51:23,324
What, about Spider?

907
00:51:23,364 --> 00:51:25,025
Yeah.

908
00:51:25,066 --> 00:51:27,660
And for looking in on me
at the hospital

909
00:51:27,702 --> 00:51:29,226
and the encouragement.

910
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:30,567
Why would he want that?

911
00:51:30,604 --> 00:51:33,164
After a while
getting away with it isn't enough.

912
00:51:33,207 --> 00:51:35,198
So is your daughter
on the team?

913
00:51:35,242 --> 00:51:38,075
No, she used to play,
but now she's 25, living in California,

914
00:51:38,112 --> 00:51:40,808
five years sober
and working as a nurse.

915
00:51:40,848 --> 00:51:43,009
And her mother?

916
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:45,075
Her mother died
when she was very young.

917
00:51:46,087 --> 00:51:49,022
He wants everybody to know
that he got away with it,

918
00:51:49,056 --> 00:51:53,083
to show everybody
just how brilliant he is.

919
00:51:53,127 --> 00:51:56,290
Most of these killings were criminals
in Rooster's and his beat, right?

920
00:51:56,330 --> 00:51:58,195
And then he all but threatens
to kill Van Luytens

921
00:51:58,232 --> 00:52:00,200
in front of hundreds of witnesses.
And then he sends us

922
00:52:00,234 --> 00:52:03,294
on this crazy wild goose chase
after Lieutenant Baum, didn't he?

923
00:52:03,337 --> 00:52:05,328
– Yes, he did.
– Why would he do that? Why?

924
00:52:05,373 --> 00:52:07,898
You gotta show me more than that.
So far you got shit.

925
00:52:07,942 --> 00:52:09,534
– Give him more, man.
– You want more?

926
00:52:09,577 --> 00:52:12,205
– How about the church records?
– The very ones that Turk was

927
00:52:12,246 --> 00:52:14,180
so diligently pursuing.
How about that?

928
00:52:14,215 --> 00:52:17,116
It turns out our most recent victim,
the late Father Connell,

929
00:52:17,151 --> 00:52:19,881
was moved all over the place...
eight parishes in 20 years.

930
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,411
Why would they do that
with a Catholic priest? It's obvious.

931
00:52:22,456 --> 00:52:24,947
He's giving the children
more than communion behind the altar.

932
00:52:24,992 --> 00:52:27,426
Now Turk already admits
to knowing this guy as a child.

933
00:52:27,461 --> 00:52:28,792
It's very plausible.

934
00:52:30,231 --> 00:52:33,394
This priest,
this Father Connell,

935
00:52:33,434 --> 00:52:35,129
he gave you your first
holy communion, eh?

936
00:52:35,169 --> 00:52:36,295
He did.

937
00:52:36,337 --> 00:52:39,568
Did he every try to do
anything inappropriate? I mean...

938
00:52:39,607 --> 00:52:41,598
I know what you mean.
No, never.

939
00:52:43,310 --> 00:52:45,301
Okay, fine.
Is there any reason

940
00:52:45,346 --> 00:52:47,576
why somebody out there
might think that he did?

941
00:52:47,615 --> 00:52:49,173
No.

942
00:52:49,216 --> 00:52:51,548
Am I a suspect here, Lieutenant?

943
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:54,611
No,

944
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:58,489
but these bodies
are starting to smell.

945
00:52:58,526 --> 00:53:01,120
A lot of it is drifting
in your direction.

946
00:53:01,162 --> 00:53:03,153
Drifting or being pushed?

947
00:53:03,197 --> 00:53:05,290
What can I say?

948
00:53:05,332 --> 00:53:07,766
You got connections
to most of these victims.

949
00:53:07,802 --> 00:53:10,737
You're not exactly
Mother Teresa.

950
00:53:12,039 --> 00:53:14,940
I never had any problem
with that priest.

951
00:53:14,975 --> 00:53:17,910
Okay. Okay, fine.

952
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:20,675
That settles it.

953
00:53:26,821 --> 00:53:28,914
I had a talk with Riley and Perez.

954
00:53:28,956 --> 00:53:30,480
Good cops.

955
00:53:30,524 --> 00:53:32,992
Don't fuck around, okay?
Just listen.

956
00:53:33,027 --> 00:53:34,289
I'm listening.

957
00:53:34,328 --> 00:53:36,728
They think
Turk might be our guy.

958
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:42,864
Oh, man. I gotta tell you,

959
00:53:42,903 --> 00:53:45,599
from where I'm sitting
that is so fucking funny.

960
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:47,698
You can't take that seriously.

961
00:53:47,741 --> 00:53:50,710
Everybody has pretty much
accepted the fact

962
00:53:50,744 --> 00:53:53,304
– that we're chasing one of our own.
– But it ain't Turk.

963
00:53:53,347 --> 00:53:55,110
Sure as I'm sitting here
he ain't the guy.

964
00:53:55,149 --> 00:53:56,776
– You know that?
– Yes, I do.

965
00:53:56,817 --> 00:53:59,285
– How do you know that?
– Because I know it.

966
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,880
I know it to a moral certainty.

967
00:54:01,922 --> 00:54:03,389
Okay?

968
00:54:04,592 --> 00:54:06,583
This priest,

969
00:54:06,627 --> 00:54:09,221
this Father Connell...

970
00:54:09,263 --> 00:54:11,561
he was Turk's priest
when he was a kid.

971
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:12,623
He told you that.

972
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:14,964
He didn't tell me this priest
was a child molester.

973
00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:17,937
– I can't believe this bullshit.
– Believe it, all right?

974
00:54:17,972 --> 00:54:20,532
– Turk's a good guy.
– You understand?

975
00:54:20,574 --> 00:54:22,838
– He's the best cop you got.
– Don't you tell me what I gotta do.

976
00:54:22,877 --> 00:54:24,936
Don't you say a goddamn word
to him about this either,

977
00:54:24,979 --> 00:54:26,913
or you're finished.

978
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:38,848
Can I speak now?

979
00:54:38,893 --> 00:54:40,690
Feel free.

980
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:45,529
He cares.
You know what I'm saying?

981
00:54:45,566 --> 00:54:48,467
Turk cares about people.

982
00:54:49,803 --> 00:54:52,795
I know he runs around
like a pit bull on crack sometimes.

983
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:55,434
It doesn't matter.

984
00:54:55,476 --> 00:54:57,740
He cares about protecting people.

985
00:54:57,778 --> 00:54:59,837
And if you don't back him,

986
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:03,751
you will regret it.

987
00:55:24,972 --> 00:55:26,462
Jesus.

988
00:55:26,507 --> 00:55:28,236
Sorry.

989
00:55:28,275 --> 00:55:30,971
I just never rattled
anyone's cage before.

990
00:55:31,011 --> 00:55:34,071
– Got a minute?
– Yeah, what's up?

991
00:55:34,114 --> 00:55:37,515
You know me and Turk
are buddies, right?

992
00:55:37,551 --> 00:55:39,041
Of course.

993
00:55:39,086 --> 00:55:40,576
I'd do anything for him.

994
00:55:40,621 --> 00:55:43,021
He would do anything for you.

995
00:55:43,057 --> 00:55:44,285
Would you?

996
00:55:44,325 --> 00:55:45,849
Would I what?

997
00:55:45,893 --> 00:55:47,918
Would you do anything for him?

998
00:55:51,465 --> 00:55:53,262
I don't know...
where is this going?

999
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:55,325
He wants you
to have sex with me.

1000
00:55:57,471 --> 00:55:59,371
Really?

1001
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:03,106
He wouldn't mind.

1002
00:56:03,143 --> 00:56:05,839
But that's not why I'm here.

1003
00:56:05,879 --> 00:56:08,541
Okay, why are you here?

1004
00:56:08,582 --> 00:56:11,813
Where were you
the night Rambo was killed

1005
00:56:11,852 --> 00:56:14,821
and Trager?
Got an alibi for those nights?

1006
00:56:16,323 --> 00:56:19,554
I mean, did you know either one
those guys before they were murdered?

1007
00:56:19,593 --> 00:56:22,562
Makes you uncomfortable
when I talk like that.

1008
00:56:22,596 --> 00:56:25,394
You look like you're guilty.
You're not guilty.

1009
00:56:25,432 --> 00:56:27,525
I know that.
You didn't kill those guys, did you?

1010
00:56:31,205 --> 00:56:34,231
Now you know what Turk feels.

1011
00:56:38,278 --> 00:56:42,009
I need you to get me
some information

1012
00:56:42,049 --> 00:56:44,074
discreetly.

1013
00:56:45,719 --> 00:56:47,152
Can you do that for me?

1014
00:56:47,187 --> 00:56:49,451
You got it.

1015
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:51,151
Absolutely.

1016
00:56:51,191 --> 00:56:53,182
Let's solve these fucking murders.

1017
00:56:57,564 --> 00:56:58,929
Oh.

1018
00:56:58,966 --> 00:57:01,059
Hey, boy genius.
– Perfect timing, buddy.

1019
00:57:01,101 --> 00:57:03,126
Listen, you really worked
on Hingis, didn't you?

1020
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:04,865
He was all worked up
about my partner.

1021
00:57:04,905 --> 00:57:06,805
Good. He should be.

1022
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,400
I think we should sit down,
see if we can square things, okay?

1023
00:57:09,443 --> 00:57:12,640
All right. Want to meet at Montrose
at 8:00 PM?

1024
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:15,979
Could you make that 9:00?
I gotta meet an old friend.

1025
00:57:16,016 --> 00:57:17,643
Yeah, sure, whatever you want.

1026
00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:23,486
♪ Baby's got issues ♪

1027
00:57:23,524 --> 00:57:26,982
♪ Baby's got pains... ♪

1028
00:57:27,027 --> 00:57:29,018
– Hey, fellows.
– Hey.

1029
00:57:29,063 --> 00:57:32,226
Thanks for coming.

1030
00:57:32,266 --> 00:57:34,894
– This here is Cheryl Brooks.
– Hello, Cheryl Brooks.

1031
00:57:34,935 --> 00:57:36,926
Cheryl's got something to tell you.

1032
00:57:38,105 --> 00:57:41,734
My daughter Lynn

1033
00:57:41,775 --> 00:57:44,300
died four years ago.

1034
00:57:44,344 --> 00:57:47,279
She was 10 years old.
She was raped and she was murdered.

1035
00:57:49,383 --> 00:57:53,513
The guy I was living with,
Charles...

1036
00:57:53,554 --> 00:57:54,714
Charles Randall.

1037
00:57:54,755 --> 00:57:57,849
Yeah, Charles Randall... he did it.

1038
00:57:57,891 --> 00:58:00,689
Why are you telling us this?

1039
00:58:00,728 --> 00:58:03,856
Because he got off for that.
He was acquitted at trial.

1040
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:06,127
– Because?
– Because?

1041
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:10,199
I testified for him.

1042
00:58:10,237 --> 00:58:13,070
– You did what?
– I said he was with me.

1043
00:58:14,641 --> 00:58:18,338
You see, Cheryl here is
a very forgiving person,

1044
00:58:18,378 --> 00:58:20,676
unlike us hard-asses.

1045
00:58:20,714 --> 00:58:22,978
– He threatened to kill me.
– Okay, Cheryl.

1046
00:58:23,016 --> 00:58:26,474
Now you say goodbye
to the nice officers

1047
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:30,354
and you go on back home.

1048
00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:33,188
Don't drink yourself to death.

1049
00:58:35,295 --> 00:58:37,820
Okay, so...

1050
00:58:37,865 --> 00:58:40,231
eh?

1051
00:58:43,137 --> 00:58:45,867
I want to hear you say it.

1052
00:58:45,906 --> 00:58:48,500
Come on, say it.

1053
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:56,939
We planted the gun
in Randall's apartment, okay?

1054
00:58:56,984 --> 00:58:59,316
I said it. Happy?

1055
00:58:59,353 --> 00:59:00,945
– Thank you.
– Yes, I am.

1056
00:59:00,988 --> 00:59:03,752
I'd do it again if I had to
'cause that fucking maggot

1057
00:59:03,791 --> 00:59:07,591
could rot away for all eternity.
I'd sleep just fine.

1058
00:59:07,628 --> 00:59:09,027
So what do you want from us?

1059
00:59:09,062 --> 00:59:11,553
You guys think
my partner's a serial killer.

1060
00:59:11,598 --> 00:59:13,395
You're way off.

1061
00:59:13,433 --> 00:59:16,493
You like Turk for this thing?
Go have your fun.

1062
00:59:16,537 --> 00:59:18,937
I'll go along with you.

1063
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:21,532
I'll even help you.

1064
00:59:21,575 --> 00:59:25,238
But do not drag up Chuck Randall
and that fucking gun,

1065
00:59:25,279 --> 00:59:28,715
because if he walks out of jail
he's gonna end up dead.

1066
00:59:28,749 --> 00:59:30,808
Excuse me?

1067
00:59:32,386 --> 00:59:35,822
I'll put two
through his fucking head

1068
00:59:35,856 --> 00:59:38,416
myself.

1069
00:59:38,458 --> 00:59:40,722
Done deal.

1070
00:59:53,774 --> 00:59:56,709
My grandmother loved opera.

1071
00:59:56,743 --> 00:59:58,768
She supported us by sewing.

1072
00:59:58,812 --> 01:00:01,906
I used to thread needles
for my grandmother.

1073
01:00:01,949 --> 01:00:04,247
– Gave all her money to church.
– You admired her?

1074
01:00:04,284 --> 01:00:06,411
I worshipped her.

1075
01:00:06,453 --> 01:00:09,251
Rooster? Yeah, he's religious,
goes to church.

1076
01:00:09,289 --> 01:00:10,984
How about you?

1077
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:14,619
Our job is keeping
99% of the population safe

1078
01:00:14,661 --> 01:00:18,097
from the other 1%.

1079
01:00:18,131 --> 01:00:21,726
The problem is that we have to
spend half our lives with that 1%.

1080
01:00:21,768 --> 01:00:23,565
And the better we do that job,

1081
01:00:23,604 --> 01:00:26,164
the less the other 99% think
they need us.

1082
01:00:26,206 --> 01:00:28,834
They're clueless.

1083
01:00:28,876 --> 01:00:30,810
The only ones paying attention
on the street

1084
01:00:30,844 --> 01:00:33,244
are the cops and the criminals.
Everyone else is just

1085
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:36,044
going somewhere
or shopping.

1086
01:00:41,688 --> 01:00:43,883
Out.
– Come on.

1087
01:00:43,924 --> 01:00:46,415
I got an order here placing you
on restricted duty.

1088
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:48,951
Now in plain English that means
you'll work at your desk.

1089
01:00:48,996 --> 01:00:51,055
You might want to cooperate
with the shrink

1090
01:00:51,098 --> 01:00:53,862
next time you two meet,
and you will meet again.

1091
01:00:57,804 --> 01:01:00,739
Cool my fucking heels.
Cool my fucking heels, huh?

1092
01:01:00,774 --> 01:01:03,504
I'm gonna blow a fucking hole
in that motherfucker Perez

1093
01:01:03,543 --> 01:01:06,410
and blow right through his head
for putting me through this bullshit.

1094
01:01:06,446 --> 01:01:08,346
– Turk.
– Fuck, I'm gonna...

1095
01:01:08,382 --> 01:01:09,679
kill that motherfucker.

1096
01:01:09,716 --> 01:01:12,514
Calm down. What the hell is it?
You're making all the wrong moves.

1097
01:01:12,552 --> 01:01:14,383
What are you talking about?
This ain't a chess game, partner.

1098
01:01:14,421 --> 01:01:16,855
Who knows? Maybe it is.
You go at Perez now...

1099
01:01:16,890 --> 01:01:19,381
you know what's gonna happen?
You're gonna walk right into a trap.

1100
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:21,587
You are.
They're just waiting for you.

1101
01:01:21,628 --> 01:01:23,323
Fucking Hingis.

1102
01:01:23,363 --> 01:01:25,627
Fucking Hingis believes him.

1103
01:01:25,666 --> 01:01:28,658
He actually fucking believes
that motherfucking Perez.

1104
01:01:28,702 --> 01:01:30,192
Stay back. Wait.

1105
01:01:30,237 --> 01:01:33,673
Wait for the right time,
then fire away.

1106
01:01:33,707 --> 01:01:35,572
Not now. Now is not the right time.

1107
01:01:35,609 --> 01:01:37,907
Believe me.

1108
01:01:37,945 --> 01:01:40,277
You believe me?
Now is not the time.

1109
01:01:40,314 --> 01:01:41,406
Uh-huh.

1110
01:01:41,448 --> 01:01:43,575
– Please.
– Yeah.

1111
01:01:43,617 --> 01:01:47,383
Hey, Turk, I gotta skip tonight.
My class ran late.

1112
01:01:47,421 --> 01:01:49,821
But I'll see you
tomorrow, all right?

1113
01:01:49,856 --> 01:01:52,757
And I'm sorry about what happened
with you and Lieutenant Hingis today.

1114
01:01:52,793 --> 01:01:54,920
It's gonna be fine.
It'll blow over.

1115
01:01:54,962 --> 01:01:57,897
People are just... everyone's crazy.
People are overreacting.

1116
01:01:57,931 --> 01:02:00,593
All right? Good night.

1117
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:09,001
It's a cop, it's a cop, it's a cop.

1118
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:20,551
What you got for me, good-looking?

1119
01:02:25,759 --> 01:02:28,819
Mark my words, there's a reason
Perez is gunning for me.

1120
01:02:28,862 --> 01:02:31,592
Perez is too smart to be that stupid.

1121
01:02:31,631 --> 01:02:34,259
For one thing, all that college-boy crap...
that's bullshit.

1122
01:02:34,301 --> 01:02:36,531
He did one year at SUNY,
only one year.

1123
01:02:36,570 --> 01:02:37,559
No kidding.

1124
01:02:37,604 --> 01:02:40,004
They threw him out...
disruptive influence.

1125
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:42,736
And I hear from the 240 he mixed it up bad
with a captain over there.

1126
01:02:42,776 --> 01:02:45,006
The guy is a total
fucking asshole.

1127
01:02:45,045 --> 01:02:46,876
BMW 3 series,

1128
01:02:46,913 --> 01:02:49,245
Mercedes CLK... too light.

1129
01:02:49,282 --> 01:02:52,251
BMW 7 series...
the biggest engine.

1130
01:02:52,285 --> 01:02:54,947
That's what you have to get.
If they shoot at you,

1131
01:02:54,988 --> 01:02:57,786
you still want
to get the fuck out of there...

1132
01:02:59,526 --> 01:03:01,357
Bentley... very good

1133
01:03:01,395 --> 01:03:04,159
because can fuck two prostitutes
in back seat

1134
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:07,928
and mount flame-thrower
on the hood. Da?

1135
01:03:07,968 --> 01:03:09,299
Da.

1136
01:03:09,336 --> 01:03:11,668
What about a Cadillac?
Come on,

1137
01:03:11,705 --> 01:03:15,197
the fucking car can't turn
fucking corner. Are you kidding me?

1138
01:03:15,242 --> 01:03:17,073
You know either one of those
Neanderthals?

1139
01:03:17,110 --> 01:03:19,874
The wop is Joe Scianci from Bensonhurst.
He's a mid-level guy.

1140
01:03:19,913 --> 01:03:21,847
What about lvan?

1141
01:03:21,882 --> 01:03:23,713
Russian guy,
Yevgeny Magulat,

1142
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:27,880
an enforcer for the Italians,
works with Gambinos a lot.

1143
01:03:32,325 --> 01:03:34,987
That shit's getting to me.

1144
01:03:35,028 --> 01:03:37,053
I know it's getting to you.

1145
01:03:38,799 --> 01:03:41,233
Shit gets to me too, you know,

1146
01:03:41,268 --> 01:03:44,362
but I take it in, I let it out
on my own terms.

1147
01:03:45,972 --> 01:03:48,031
I bet you didn't write
one word down

1148
01:03:48,075 --> 01:03:49,975
in that little notebook
Prosky gave us.

1149
01:03:50,010 --> 01:03:52,570
Of course not. Did you?

1150
01:03:52,612 --> 01:03:54,944
Yeah, it's great.

1151
01:03:56,516 --> 01:03:58,882
It helps me put things in perspective.

1152
01:03:58,919 --> 01:04:02,912
You know what I'm saying?
Write it down, get it out.

1153
01:04:02,956 --> 01:04:05,481
– You should try this.
– Let's have a look.

1154
01:04:05,525 --> 01:04:08,153
What, are you kidding me?
Oh, come on, come on.

1155
01:04:08,195 --> 01:04:10,663
This belongs to me... private.

1156
01:04:10,697 --> 01:04:15,066
– You don't want to let me see?
– Close to my heart. No, sir.

1157
01:04:15,102 --> 01:04:17,297
I just got sick
of the whole fucking game...

1158
01:04:17,337 --> 01:04:19,805
run around looking for clues,
making arrests,

1159
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:22,365
write reports, testify, cut deals.

1160
01:04:22,409 --> 01:04:25,310
It was all just so much
fucking bullshit.

1161
01:04:28,215 --> 01:04:29,375
Detective...

1162
01:04:35,122 --> 01:04:36,521
Then it all got real simple.

1163
01:04:36,556 --> 01:04:39,582
Yeah, Detective Perez here.
Hey, brother, what's up?

1164
01:04:39,626 --> 01:04:42,561
I hate scumbags. I like shooting people.
What was I giving up?

1165
01:04:42,596 --> 01:04:45,588
Hey, look, I set the meeting up
with Rooster first thing tomorrow.

1166
01:04:45,632 --> 01:04:49,033
Come on, you gotta be fast, man.
I don't want Turk getting wind of anything.

1167
01:04:49,069 --> 01:04:51,435
A retirement party and a gold watch?

1168
01:04:51,471 --> 01:04:54,269
A handshake from the mayor
and my name on some fucking plaque?

1169
01:05:00,514 --> 01:05:01,708
Big fucking deal.

1170
01:05:03,950 --> 01:05:04,974
It's better this way.

1171
01:05:06,786 --> 01:05:09,619
Now everybody knows
who I was and where I stood.

1172
01:05:53,099 --> 01:05:55,090
Hey, it's me.

1173
01:05:56,570 --> 01:06:00,028
Listen, I think somebody
followed me here... home.

1174
01:06:00,073 --> 01:06:02,541
He's outside right now.

1175
01:06:02,576 --> 01:06:06,273
Can you come over or...?

1176
01:06:06,313 --> 01:06:09,373
Just call me back, okay?
All right.

1177
01:06:39,546 --> 01:06:41,912
Don't move.

1178
01:06:54,794 --> 01:06:57,820
– Come on, open up.
– Turk?

1179
01:07:03,069 --> 01:07:05,230
I just called you.

1180
01:07:05,272 --> 01:07:06,864
Put the gun down.

1181
01:07:06,906 --> 01:07:08,897
There's a car following me.

1182
01:07:08,942 --> 01:07:11,706
Put the gun down.
Put the gun down.

1183
01:07:15,615 --> 01:07:17,105
Have you got
something to tell me?

1184
01:07:17,150 --> 01:07:18,947
About what?

1185
01:07:18,985 --> 01:07:21,545
Trager, Randall.

1186
01:07:21,588 --> 01:07:23,579
Did you sneak
into my apartment?

1187
01:07:23,623 --> 01:07:25,614
What are they doing
on your computer?

1188
01:07:25,659 --> 01:07:27,889
I was checking
all the links in the case.

1189
01:07:31,231 --> 01:07:32,926
Are you hiding something
from me?

1190
01:07:36,169 --> 01:07:37,727
Huh?

1191
01:07:39,239 --> 01:07:42,106
I just received this... this poem.

1192
01:07:42,142 --> 01:07:44,736
A poem?
Not worth mentioning, huh?

1193
01:07:44,778 --> 01:07:47,303
The handwriting
doesn't even match.

1194
01:07:47,347 --> 01:07:49,542
It's a fake.

1195
01:07:49,582 --> 01:07:51,573
Did you write it?

1196
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:55,980
Did you write it?

1197
01:08:00,193 --> 01:08:02,753
What the hell is going on here?

1198
01:08:02,796 --> 01:08:04,957
You're spending a lot of time
with Perez, aren't you?

1199
01:08:04,998 --> 01:08:06,863
Yeah, I've been working the case.

1200
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:09,061
What, are you jealous?

1201
01:08:09,102 --> 01:08:11,866
Can I trust you?

1202
01:08:14,007 --> 01:08:16,737
– Yes.
– Okay.

1203
01:08:16,776 --> 01:08:19,210
Get me anything and everything
that you can find out

1204
01:08:19,245 --> 01:08:21,679
about Perez or Riley,
what they know about me.

1205
01:08:23,416 --> 01:08:25,247
Everything.

1206
01:08:25,285 --> 01:08:27,753
Karen, don't play me.

1207
01:08:29,022 --> 01:08:32,685
I am leaning much further
into saying that it is a cop.

1208
01:08:32,726 --> 01:08:36,059
Tell you what... I'm moving
past the leaning stage

1209
01:08:36,096 --> 01:08:38,894
and I'm moving towards the
l-know-for-sure-it's-a-fucking-cop stage,

1210
01:08:38,932 --> 01:08:41,264
considering how expertly
he shot the shit out of my house.

1211
01:08:41,301 --> 01:08:43,565
Oh my God.
Are you hurt?

1212
01:08:43,603 --> 01:08:45,696
Am I hurt? Am I hurt?
He wants to know if I'm hurt.

1213
01:08:45,739 --> 01:08:47,273
Actually, he's dead.

1214
01:08:49,976 --> 01:08:53,309
His name is Magulat.
The guy we saw at Salerno's.

1215
01:08:53,346 --> 01:08:56,406
Yeah, he's in intensive care
at St. Luke's.

1216
01:08:56,449 --> 01:08:58,440
They think he's the guy

1217
01:08:58,485 --> 01:09:00,953
– chopped off Yakov Pearlstein's head.
– What do you think?

1218
01:09:00,987 --> 01:09:03,217
You think he's a victim,
or could he be our suspect?

1219
01:09:03,256 --> 01:09:06,282
I don't know, but either way
I think it's gonna be fun.

1220
01:09:07,327 --> 01:09:10,228
Doctor, what's the story?

1221
01:09:10,263 --> 01:09:13,255
He's one of the toughest human beings
I've ever come into contact with.

1222
01:09:13,299 --> 01:09:15,062
We took six bullets
out of him.

1223
01:09:15,101 --> 01:09:16,966
Six? Whoo!

1224
01:09:17,003 --> 01:09:19,767
Three from the night he was wounded,
three from previous shootings.

1225
01:09:19,806 --> 01:09:21,706
The man is a tank.

1226
01:09:21,741 --> 01:09:23,800
Do you mind if I talk to him
a little bit?

1227
01:09:23,843 --> 01:09:26,471
His jaw's wired shut,
but go ahead.

1228
01:09:26,513 --> 01:09:29,414
That's okay. I'll ask the questions.
He can just grunt.

1229
01:09:29,449 --> 01:09:32,384
Hey, Yevgeny.

1230
01:09:32,419 --> 01:09:34,649
Wake up.

1231
01:09:34,687 --> 01:09:39,386
That's it. Wake up,
you big fucking grizzly bear.

1232
01:09:39,426 --> 01:09:41,826
You don't speak Russian?

1233
01:09:41,861 --> 01:09:45,456
Swoboda. Swoboda. Swoboda.

1234
01:09:45,498 --> 01:09:47,989
Ron.

1235
01:09:52,806 --> 01:09:56,037
I'm thinking this Russian killing machine
could be our first eyewitness.

1236
01:09:58,812 --> 01:10:01,679
Wake up, gugumuck.
You can tell us who did this to you.

1237
01:10:05,919 --> 01:10:09,355
Detective, I think that's enough.

1238
01:10:09,389 --> 01:10:12,847
Then you could tell us where you put
Yakov Pearlstein's head.

1239
01:10:16,262 --> 01:10:19,163
4-3, 4-3, I need a round-the-clock
security detail

1240
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:23,465
on a patient Magulat,
M-A-gulat,

1241
01:10:23,503 --> 01:10:25,698
St. Luke's in the ICU.

1242
01:10:27,540 --> 01:10:31,408
♪ I wake up in the morning... ♪

1243
01:10:31,444 --> 01:10:34,709
Is this the number to call
to report a case of police brutality?

1244
01:10:34,747 --> 01:10:38,205
– Cat got your tongue?
– Out on bail again?

1245
01:10:38,251 --> 01:10:40,515
What, you think you can scare me,
little bitch? What do you want?

1246
01:10:40,553 --> 01:10:42,885
Be careful, Detective.
My taxes pay your salary.

1247
01:10:42,922 --> 01:10:45,516
You don't pay any fucking taxes,
you lowlife piece of shit.

1248
01:10:45,558 --> 01:10:47,924
– Get to the point, come on.
– One of your vics, Trager,

1249
01:10:47,961 --> 01:10:50,589
stole a whole lot of guns
down South.

1250
01:10:50,630 --> 01:10:52,723
Same guns are turning up
on your murder scenes.

1251
01:10:52,765 --> 01:10:54,062
So it's simple...

1252
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:56,625
find stolen guns,
you got your guy.

1253
01:10:56,669 --> 01:10:58,500
So you know the guy?

1254
01:10:58,538 --> 01:11:01,336
Do you know if there's a cop out there
who might be a danger to the public?

1255
01:11:01,374 --> 01:11:04,138
I couldn't live with myself
if I just stood by and didn't say anything.

1256
01:11:04,177 --> 01:11:07,169
Look, I'm gonna give you
two seconds more. Give me yes or no.

1257
01:11:07,213 --> 01:11:10,148
Do you know the guy?
And when do I meet you to talk about it?

1258
01:11:10,183 --> 01:11:12,913
Friday, 9:00 PM, at my club.

1259
01:11:12,952 --> 01:11:14,112
I'll be there.

1260
01:11:14,153 --> 01:11:16,178
Man, there's dumb
and there's dumber,

1261
01:11:16,222 --> 01:11:18,690
but this is the motherfucking dumbest
right here, man.

1262
01:11:18,725 --> 01:11:20,886
Easy, son, easy.
It's gonna be easy for you.

1263
01:11:20,927 --> 01:11:24,522
All you gotta do is be bait, that's all.
Be a little sardine for us, all right?

1264
01:11:24,564 --> 01:11:27,226
You help us... we got you covered.
Your club doesn't get hassled

1265
01:11:27,267 --> 01:11:29,792
and you don't have a revolving door
in and out of jail.

1266
01:11:29,836 --> 01:11:31,428
Do we have a deal or not?

1267
01:11:31,471 --> 01:11:34,872
Yeah, but your boy come in here
and go Hannibal Lecter on my ass,

1268
01:11:34,908 --> 01:11:37,433
I don't want no Jodie fucking Foster
coming through the door.

1269
01:11:37,477 --> 01:11:39,308
I want the goddamn
Marine Corps, man.

1270
01:11:39,345 --> 01:11:42,974
♪ Since Color Me Badd was singing
"I wanna sex you up"... ♪

1271
01:12:12,011 --> 01:12:13,501
Evening, Detective.

1272
01:12:13,546 --> 01:12:16,749
You want one? It's shit,
but it's better than nothing, right?

1273
01:12:16,749 --> 01:12:19,980
As soon as I heard
the fucking Russian didn't die

1274
01:12:20,019 --> 01:12:22,283
I knew things would never
be the same.

1275
01:12:22,322 --> 01:12:24,483
I had to change the rules,

1276
01:12:24,524 --> 01:12:26,515
the strategy.

1277
01:12:26,559 --> 01:12:30,325
I had to be bold, do something
that could never be undone.

1278
01:12:38,171 --> 01:12:40,473
I went for the unforgivable.

1279
01:13:07,567 --> 01:13:10,263
No. Please. No.

1280
01:13:32,291 --> 01:13:35,158
Did you hear
anything I just said?

1281
01:13:36,329 --> 01:13:40,060
How exactly could I be
blowing this out of proportion?

1282
01:13:40,099 --> 01:13:42,260
That psycho just assaulted me.

1283
01:13:42,301 --> 01:13:45,600
I am telling you
he is a classic sociopath.

1284
01:13:45,638 --> 01:13:47,765
Okay okay,
I'll look into it, all right?

1285
01:13:47,807 --> 01:13:49,297
I'll look into it.

1286
01:13:49,342 --> 01:13:51,503
You stay the hell away from here.
Understood?

1287
01:13:51,544 --> 01:13:53,341
Understood?

1288
01:13:55,415 --> 01:13:56,746
Fuck that.

1289
01:14:08,161 --> 01:14:10,459
Check the ball,
check the ball.

1290
01:14:11,964 --> 01:14:15,195
I got the ball. I got the ball. I got the ball.
Stay on him. Stay on him.

1291
01:14:15,234 --> 01:14:17,168
Excuse me,
I'm Detective Corelli.

1292
01:14:17,203 --> 01:14:20,138
– I need to see your reservation book.
Sure. Help yourself.

1293
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:29,810
– Thank you.
– Anytime.

1294
01:14:29,849 --> 01:14:31,544
Yes, this is Detective Corelli.

1295
01:14:31,584 --> 01:14:34,018
I've been trying to reach
Detectives Perez and Riley

1296
01:14:34,053 --> 01:14:35,987
and I can't seem
to locate them.

1297
01:14:36,022 --> 01:14:39,014
I like to party.
– That's nothing. I was into Kiss.

1298
01:14:39,058 --> 01:14:41,049
I used to run
around the house

1299
01:14:41,094 --> 01:14:43,221
with my tongue hanging out,
spitting fake blood.

1300
01:14:43,262 --> 01:14:44,559
I need to speak to them
urgently.

1301
01:14:48,401 --> 01:14:51,802
Yes, I understand,
but I need the location, please.

1302
01:15:20,366 --> 01:15:22,857
Hey, he's here.

1303
01:15:22,902 --> 01:15:24,096
Let me in.

1304
01:15:29,575 --> 01:15:29,642
Thank God it's the police.

1305
01:15:29,642 --> 01:15:31,872
Thank God it's the police.

1306
01:15:31,911 --> 01:15:34,243
Yeah, so where do we go?

1307
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:36,214
Follow me.

1308
01:15:36,249 --> 01:15:38,547
I used to play ball
a couple of blocks from here.

1309
01:15:38,584 --> 01:15:39,812
Get the fuck out of here.

1310
01:15:39,852 --> 01:15:42,787
When I was a kid I wasn't afraid
to mix it up with guys like you.

1311
01:15:42,822 --> 01:15:44,119
You still ain't.

1312
01:15:44,157 --> 01:15:46,682
Yeah, nowadays
I carry a gun with me.

1313
01:15:46,726 --> 01:15:49,991
It's a bad neighborhood.

1314
01:15:50,029 --> 01:15:52,020
– It ain't bad for me.
– Yeah, well...

1315
01:15:52,064 --> 01:15:54,464
Yeah, he's inside.

1316
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:56,058
Well, so far so good.

1317
01:15:56,102 --> 01:15:58,696
So now that we're done with
the pleasantries, what do you got for me?

1318
01:15:58,738 --> 01:15:59,966
He's talking.

1319
01:16:00,006 --> 01:16:01,997
– What did you think he was gonna do?
How about an apology?

1320
01:16:02,041 --> 01:16:04,805
The shit that happened to Stubby,
that wasn't supposed to happen.

1321
01:16:04,844 --> 01:16:08,371
Lieutenant, that's a crock of shit.
– I lost three fucking teeth that day.

1322
01:16:08,414 --> 01:16:10,678
He's not a civilian.
He's a fucking dealer.

1323
01:16:10,716 --> 01:16:12,775
– And I kept my mouth shut.
– So what?

1324
01:16:12,819 --> 01:16:16,118
You guys love those stupid gold teeth.
You should thank me.

1325
01:16:16,155 --> 01:16:18,988
Well, he's wearing a vest
and Starsky and Hutch here

1326
01:16:19,025 --> 01:16:22,051
are watching him like a couple
of hawks... gay hawks.

1327
01:16:22,094 --> 01:16:25,257
Yeah, right there, buddy.

1328
01:16:25,298 --> 01:16:28,267
All right, enough bullshit.
So you know our poetry boy?

1329
01:16:28,301 --> 01:16:30,292
Just talk to me.
What do you got for me?

1330
01:16:30,336 --> 01:16:32,395
– All right, here we go.
– Here we go.

1331
01:16:32,438 --> 01:16:33,905
Would you please?

1332
01:16:33,940 --> 01:16:36,773
Just 'cause the guy's talking tough,
that don't mean shit.

1333
01:16:36,809 --> 01:16:38,606
Let me ask you something,
Copernicus.

1334
01:16:38,644 --> 01:16:41,238
That gun on his belt...
do you think it's a service pistol?

1335
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:43,942
I bet you we'll trace it back to Trager's.
What do you think about that?

1336
01:16:43,983 --> 01:16:45,712
– What do you want to bet?
– 500 bucks.

1337
01:16:45,751 --> 01:16:47,878
– You're on.
– I'm in for another five.

1338
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:50,286
Oh, this is fun.

1339
01:16:50,323 --> 01:16:52,518
Look, I help you,
you reciprocate.

1340
01:16:52,558 --> 01:16:54,025
So help me.

1341
01:16:54,060 --> 01:16:56,358
All right, you might see
a little bit of a cell-phone video.

1342
01:16:56,395 --> 01:16:58,454
I got it in front of Trager's
the night he bought it.

1343
01:16:58,497 --> 01:17:00,431
– You got what?
– I got a movie...

1344
01:17:00,466 --> 01:17:03,958
a couple of kids back from the prom,
preserving their special memories,

1345
01:17:04,003 --> 01:17:05,698
a positive ID of you, big time.

1346
01:17:05,738 --> 01:17:07,899
– Oh, yeah? Of me?
– Yeah.

1347
01:17:07,940 --> 01:17:09,669
Okay.

1348
01:17:09,709 --> 01:17:11,233
Now you know
what I'm talking about.

1349
01:17:11,277 --> 01:17:13,643
Yeah, now I got it.

1350
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:15,613
Yeah, well,
so how do I look?

1351
01:17:18,684 --> 01:17:20,242
Like a poet?

1352
01:17:21,254 --> 01:17:22,915
'Cause that's what I am,
you know, a poet.

1353
01:17:22,955 --> 01:17:25,651
All right, come on, let's go.

1354
01:17:25,691 --> 01:17:28,319
In fact, I wrote a poem for you, Spider.
Want to hear it?

1355
01:17:28,361 --> 01:17:30,295
Eh?

1356
01:17:34,166 --> 01:17:37,658
Drop your gun right now, motherfucker!
Drop to the ground right now!

1357
01:17:37,703 --> 01:17:39,534
Oh! Oh! Grease me up and...

1358
01:17:39,572 --> 01:17:41,631
I mean, do they actually pay
you two morons?

1359
01:17:41,674 --> 01:17:44,939
– Put the fucking weapon on the ground.
– Gladly. Gladly. Right there.

1360
01:17:44,977 --> 01:17:46,945
Right there. There you go.

1361
01:17:48,114 --> 01:17:50,014
Hey, you want to read my poem?

1362
01:17:50,049 --> 01:17:51,482
Easy easy.

1363
01:17:51,517 --> 01:17:52,814
Here, read it.

1364
01:17:54,987 --> 01:17:57,251
"You tried to set me up, you fucks,

1365
01:17:57,290 --> 01:17:59,087
And this is how you do it?

1366
01:17:59,125 --> 01:18:01,855
You thought I'd get
my dick cut off,

1367
01:18:01,894 --> 01:18:04,454
Instead you only blew it."

1368
01:18:04,497 --> 01:18:06,522
Great stuff.

1369
01:18:06,565 --> 01:18:08,931
– What is that shit?
– Thank you.

1370
01:18:08,968 --> 01:18:11,402
That is poetry.

1371
01:18:11,437 --> 01:18:13,166
What are you doing here?

1372
01:18:13,205 --> 01:18:15,036
Well, don't look at me, partner,

1373
01:18:15,074 --> 01:18:17,565
but I tagged along
to protect your ass

1374
01:18:17,610 --> 01:18:20,943
and to see the look on their faces.
It was worth it.

1375
01:18:20,980 --> 01:18:23,346
We're doing our jobs here, okay?
I'm not gonna apologize for that.

1376
01:18:23,382 --> 01:18:26,010
I never want you to apologize, Teddy.
There's a killer out there with a badge.

1377
01:18:26,052 --> 01:18:28,213
– What are you morons doing about it?
– What do you think we're doing here?

1378
01:18:28,254 --> 01:18:30,119
– That's not it.
– No, that's not it.

1379
01:18:30,156 --> 01:18:32,056
I just made 1000 bucks.

1380
01:18:32,091 --> 01:18:33,956
Where's the other gun?
Give it to me.

1381
01:18:33,993 --> 01:18:35,790
Why don't you frisk me, Sherlock?
Go ahead.

1382
01:18:35,828 --> 01:18:38,023
– Frisk me, go ahead. Go ahead.
– Yeah, I'm gonna frisk you.

1383
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:43,762
Ooh, nice touch, Mary.

1384
01:18:43,803 --> 01:18:45,964
What are you doing after work?
Unless you're committed.

1385
01:18:46,005 --> 01:18:48,235
I don't want to get
in the middle of anything.

1386
01:18:48,274 --> 01:18:51,505
What happened to your face?
Your mick friend give you a little love bite?

1387
01:18:51,544 --> 01:18:54,911
– Shut the fuck up. Shut your fucking face.
– Hey hey hey! Whoa!

1388
01:18:54,947 --> 01:18:57,677
I'll blow your brains out
if you don't get the fuck away.

1389
01:18:57,717 --> 01:18:59,878
What's he talking about?

1390
01:18:59,919 --> 01:19:01,716
– What's he talking about?
– What he's talking about is,

1391
01:19:01,754 --> 01:19:04,086
just 'cause you didn't go for this
doesn't mean you're not our guy.

1392
01:19:04,123 --> 01:19:06,489
– Now we gotta break this shit up.
– Don't translate for me, man.

1393
01:19:06,525 --> 01:19:09,153
Will you let this go?
You fucked up, okay?

1394
01:19:09,195 --> 01:19:11,720
– We fucked up 'cause you helped him.
– I'm gonna nail your ass.

1395
01:19:11,764 --> 01:19:14,130
I'm not through with you, man.
Make a mistake.

1396
01:19:14,166 --> 01:19:16,157
I'm gonna
break this stuff down, okay?

1397
01:19:16,202 --> 01:19:18,432
You fucking dog.

1398
01:19:19,972 --> 01:19:22,736
Relax, Spider.

1399
01:19:22,775 --> 01:19:25,107
Come on, let's have a drink.

1400
01:19:25,144 --> 01:19:28,705
I saw what I think
is a refrigerator here.

1401
01:19:32,918 --> 01:19:34,579
I'll be back in a second.

1402
01:19:43,529 --> 01:19:45,019
Hey, muffinhead.

1403
01:19:48,234 --> 01:19:49,701
Is this the person
who shot you?

1404
01:19:50,703 --> 01:19:52,637
You're sure?

1405
01:19:58,377 --> 01:20:00,402
No, you're the pumpkinhead.

1406
01:20:11,657 --> 01:20:13,625
You miss me?

1407
01:20:15,661 --> 01:20:17,993
"...of death and pain,

1408
01:20:18,030 --> 01:20:20,191
Place oneself among the slain.

1409
01:20:20,232 --> 01:20:22,757
If one addiction goes unfed,

1410
01:20:22,802 --> 01:20:25,100
The world is better with him dead."

1411
01:20:43,689 --> 01:20:44,917
Take it easy.

1412
01:20:44,957 --> 01:20:46,720
It's okay.
It's gonna be all right.

1413
01:20:46,759 --> 01:20:48,989
Jesus Christ, Rooster.

1414
01:20:49,028 --> 01:20:51,895
Just move into the room. Here.

1415
01:20:51,931 --> 01:20:54,399
Sit down. Sit down.

1416
01:20:57,303 --> 01:20:59,294
Okay.

1417
01:20:59,338 --> 01:21:03,035
You gotta know about this,
Tom, from me.

1418
01:21:03,075 --> 01:21:06,169
Now just open that little book,
start reading.

1419
01:21:06,212 --> 01:21:08,680
Everything you want to know
is in there.

1420
01:21:10,716 --> 01:21:12,707
So go ahead.

1421
01:21:14,286 --> 01:21:16,277
Out loud.

1422
01:21:17,623 --> 01:21:19,716
For the record.

1423
01:21:19,758 --> 01:21:22,522
See the little video here?

1424
01:21:28,934 --> 01:21:32,301
"My name is David Fisk,
Detective First Grade.

1425
01:21:32,338 --> 01:21:36,399
I've been a cop in the NYPD
for nearly 30 years."

1426
01:21:37,510 --> 01:21:41,037
– Dave, Dave, Dave, Dave.
– Tom,

1427
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:44,174
we've got a lot to cover
and not much time to do it in, so...

1428
01:21:47,453 --> 01:21:50,650
"My name is David Fisk,
Detective First Grade."

1429
01:21:50,689 --> 01:21:53,214
My name is David Fisk.

1430
01:21:53,259 --> 01:21:56,285
"I've been a cop in the NYPD
for nearly 30 years."

1431
01:21:56,328 --> 01:21:59,195
I don't expect you
to remember me.

1432
01:21:59,231 --> 01:22:01,256
I mean, it's been a long time

1433
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:05,100
since you sat me on your lap
and told me you loved me.

1434
01:22:05,137 --> 01:22:08,197
"In that time

1435
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:10,970
I've killed 14 people."

1436
01:22:12,077 --> 01:22:14,068
But I guarantee

1437
01:22:14,113 --> 01:22:17,276
you're gonna remember the name
for the rest of your life.

1438
01:22:27,793 --> 01:22:31,388
"You don't become a cop
because you want to serve and protect.

1439
01:22:32,831 --> 01:22:35,891
You join the force because they let you
carry a gun and a badge.

1440
01:22:35,935 --> 01:22:38,597
Most people respect the badge.

1441
01:22:38,637 --> 01:22:40,730
Everybody respects the gun."

1442
01:22:40,773 --> 01:22:43,606
I'm the killer.
I show up at your door.

1443
01:22:43,642 --> 01:22:46,475
What are you talking about?
It's not a fucking chess game.

1444
01:22:46,512 --> 01:22:49,606
Who knows? Maybe it is.
You're making all the wrong moves.

1445
01:22:49,648 --> 01:22:51,843
I'm gonna put two
through his fucking head

1446
01:22:51,884 --> 01:22:54,216
myself.

1447
01:22:54,253 --> 01:22:56,414
I know it to a moral certainty.

1448
01:22:56,455 --> 01:22:58,980
You sort of get numb to it.

1449
01:23:08,534 --> 01:23:11,264
"Tom Cowen was my role model.

1450
01:23:21,347 --> 01:23:23,645
The day I stopped trying to be him

1451
01:23:23,682 --> 01:23:26,014
was the greatest day of my life.

1452
01:23:30,055 --> 01:23:33,354
Several years back I framed
a lowlife child killer

1453
01:23:33,392 --> 01:23:36,054
named Charles Randall.

1454
01:23:37,830 --> 01:23:40,230
I should have known
it would come back to haunt me."

1455
01:23:44,436 --> 01:23:46,802
What do you want me
to do with this?

1456
01:23:48,607 --> 01:23:51,041
Is that all you got to say?

1457
01:23:51,076 --> 01:23:53,306
I owe you this explanation, pal.

1458
01:23:53,345 --> 01:23:55,370
Why are you telling me now?

1459
01:23:55,414 --> 01:23:59,748
lvan the Terrible
is gonna wake up pretty soon

1460
01:23:59,785 --> 01:24:01,582
and he's gonna ID me.

1461
01:24:07,159 --> 01:24:08,990
Evening, Detective.

1462
01:24:09,028 --> 01:24:11,997
You want one? It's shit,
but it's better than nothing, right?

1463
01:24:12,031 --> 01:24:16,195
I can just walk right in here.
Your partner's asleep. Step outside.

1464
01:24:16,235 --> 01:24:19,068
Did I ever pick
the wrong fucking Russki to shoot?

1465
01:24:28,447 --> 01:24:30,847
Now we're going off the record.

1466
01:24:33,385 --> 01:24:37,185
Uh, I'm going to take the rap
for the Randall gun thing.

1467
01:24:37,222 --> 01:24:39,053
You saw that.

1468
01:24:39,091 --> 01:24:42,254
I mean, considering
the circumstances, why not?

1469
01:24:42,294 --> 01:24:44,762
No need to thank me.

1470
01:24:45,964 --> 01:24:47,898
That business about not being me...

1471
01:24:47,933 --> 01:24:49,423
Yeah.

1472
01:24:49,468 --> 01:24:51,436
I don't get that.

1473
01:24:51,470 --> 01:24:55,463
Well, you're a great cop, Tom.

1474
01:24:55,507 --> 01:24:57,498
I mean, you were the one

1475
01:24:57,543 --> 01:25:00,603
I aspired to all my life
and could never be.

1476
01:25:02,181 --> 01:25:04,581
Then you broke the law,

1477
01:25:04,616 --> 01:25:07,779
planted the gun on Randall,

1478
01:25:07,820 --> 01:25:11,085
let me down.

1479
01:25:12,825 --> 01:25:14,759
I lost my faith.

1480
01:25:16,328 --> 01:25:20,287
That's when it all started.

1481
01:25:20,332 --> 01:25:22,994
And once it did,

1482
01:25:23,035 --> 01:25:25,060
I couldn't stop.

1483
01:25:26,438 --> 01:25:30,135
Finally,

1484
01:25:30,175 --> 01:25:32,666
I didn't want to.

1485
01:25:39,084 --> 01:25:42,645
So I did my own thing.

1486
01:25:42,688 --> 01:25:45,282
And you know what? In the end

1487
01:25:45,324 --> 01:25:47,622
it got done.

1488
01:25:47,659 --> 01:25:50,184
The scum went down.

1489
01:25:50,229 --> 01:25:52,094
And that's it. That's that.

1490
01:25:53,632 --> 01:25:55,930
I don't understand
a word you said,

1491
01:25:55,968 --> 01:25:58,129
– don't understand any of it.
– I know you don't, Tom.

1492
01:25:58,170 --> 01:26:00,866
As soon as I heard
the Russian didn't die

1493
01:26:00,906 --> 01:26:03,272
I knew I had to change the rules,

1494
01:26:03,308 --> 01:26:06,141
do something that could
never be undone.

1495
01:26:06,178 --> 01:26:08,237
I went for the unforgivable.

1496
01:26:11,950 --> 01:26:13,474
No.

1497
01:26:14,953 --> 01:26:17,217
So what am I gonna do, my friend,

1498
01:26:17,256 --> 01:26:19,884
partner? Arrest you?

1499
01:26:19,925 --> 01:26:22,792
At some point I gotta call it in.

1500
01:26:22,828 --> 01:26:24,227
We're a team.

1501
01:26:24,263 --> 01:26:25,958
We were.

1502
01:26:25,998 --> 01:26:27,989
Yeah, we were, a great team.

1503
01:26:28,033 --> 01:26:30,524
That was yesterday, Dave.

1504
01:26:30,569 --> 01:26:31,695
Today...

1505
01:26:33,806 --> 01:26:36,775
today you're pointing a gun at me.

1506
01:26:41,213 --> 01:26:44,341
But it hasn't gone off yet.

1507
01:26:49,721 --> 01:26:51,211
Bye, Tom.

1508
01:26:51,256 --> 01:26:53,349
– Where are you going?
– I don't know.

1509
01:26:53,392 --> 01:26:56,395
To hell, I suppose.

1510
01:27:43,075 --> 01:27:45,100
– Hey, Dave, Dave.
– Whoa.

1511
01:27:45,143 --> 01:27:47,703
Don't come closer!

1512
01:27:47,746 --> 01:27:50,078
– You wouldn't.
– You want to bet your life on it?

1513
01:27:50,115 --> 01:27:52,083
Come on, partner, I know you.
You wouldn't.

1514
01:27:52,117 --> 01:27:54,483
But I would.

1515
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:55,748
Oh.

1516
01:27:55,787 --> 01:27:57,778
Karen, just take it easy.

1517
01:27:57,823 --> 01:27:59,848
– Can't get me out of your mind?
– Shut up, Dave.

1518
01:27:59,892 --> 01:28:03,919
You're gonna defend
this lowlife piece of shit?

1519
01:28:03,962 --> 01:28:06,897
– Boy, I'm in your head.
– I'm not defending him. Take it easy.

1520
01:28:06,932 --> 01:28:10,095
Fuck you, Turk.
Put the gun down, Fisk.

1521
01:28:10,135 --> 01:28:11,602
– And if I don't?
– Dave.

1522
01:28:11,637 --> 01:28:14,401
– How about I blow your brains out?
– Ooh, I like the sound of that.

1523
01:28:14,439 --> 01:28:16,373
– Don't move.
– Karen.

1524
01:28:16,408 --> 01:28:18,808
You blow me away, Turk dies.
Is that your idea?

1525
01:28:18,844 --> 01:28:20,175
I said don't move, you prick.

1526
01:28:20,212 --> 01:28:22,510
Bye-bye!

1527
01:28:24,182 --> 01:28:25,774
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun.

1528
01:28:27,452 --> 01:28:29,147
Stay here.

1529
01:28:35,928 --> 01:28:37,327
Oh, man.

1530
01:28:38,664 --> 01:28:39,926
Fuck.

1531
01:28:41,466 --> 01:28:43,366
These old locks...

1532
01:28:43,402 --> 01:28:45,097
I mean, they're good.

1533
01:28:45,137 --> 01:28:47,105
Dave, you've got to end
this thing.

1534
01:28:47,139 --> 01:28:49,198
End it?

1535
01:28:49,241 --> 01:28:50,538
Put the gun down.

1536
01:28:50,576 --> 01:28:53,374
What's your plan?

1537
01:28:53,412 --> 01:28:55,710
Are you gonna arrest me?

1538
01:28:55,747 --> 01:28:58,580
Are you gonna take me down
to the precinct, book me,

1539
01:28:58,617 --> 01:29:02,280
fingerprint me,
body-cavity-search me?

1540
01:29:02,321 --> 01:29:04,186
What the fuck
are you gonna do?

1541
01:29:04,222 --> 01:29:07,157
wheel me out on the "Geraldo" show,
a freak of the week?

1542
01:29:07,192 --> 01:29:11,891
Or better yet, an in-depth
psycho profile on "Oprah"?

1543
01:29:11,930 --> 01:29:14,228
Are you ready for that?
It ain't gonna fly, man.

1544
01:29:14,266 --> 01:29:16,632
Dave, you give me no choice.

1545
01:29:16,668 --> 01:29:18,499
You got a choice... I escape.

1546
01:29:20,072 --> 01:29:22,336
Would you do that for me, Tom?

1547
01:29:23,442 --> 01:29:24,670
Would you let me escape?

1548
01:29:24,710 --> 01:29:26,234
Come on, don't do this.

1549
01:29:26,278 --> 01:29:28,610
I'm gonna make a run for it.

1550
01:29:28,647 --> 01:29:30,842
What do you think?

1551
01:29:30,882 --> 01:29:33,874
You gotta do the right thing.

1552
01:29:39,891 --> 01:29:41,950
That's a 10-10, partner...

1553
01:29:41,994 --> 01:29:45,361
shots fired, suspect fleeing.
Let's go!

1554
01:29:45,397 --> 01:29:47,024
Come on, don't go there.

1555
01:29:48,533 --> 01:29:51,593
Hey, partner, come on.
Shots fired.

1556
01:29:51,637 --> 01:29:54,071
– Don't do this.
– Suspect fleeing,

1557
01:29:54,106 --> 01:29:56,540
resisting arrest. Come on.

1558
01:30:05,951 --> 01:30:08,852
A righteous man

1559
01:30:08,887 --> 01:30:11,617
Before me stands,

1560
01:30:11,657 --> 01:30:16,026
A hero in these filthy lands.

1561
01:30:16,061 --> 01:30:19,462
A brother in arms,

1562
01:30:19,498 --> 01:30:22,956
In heart are you.

1563
01:30:23,001 --> 01:30:25,663
I was really hoping

1564
01:30:25,704 --> 01:30:28,366
You'd get it too.

1565
01:30:31,843 --> 01:30:34,403
– I do get it.
– No, you don't.

1566
01:30:34,446 --> 01:30:36,380
No, I get it.

1567
01:30:42,721 --> 01:30:45,986
You know, the only thing
in this life

1568
01:30:46,024 --> 01:30:48,857
that ever gave me
any satisfaction

1569
01:30:48,894 --> 01:30:50,794
was killing those fucks.

1570
01:30:52,731 --> 01:30:55,063
So this is for real.

1571
01:30:55,100 --> 01:30:57,466
I mean,

1572
01:30:57,502 --> 01:30:59,834
this one is bad.

1573
01:31:02,007 --> 01:31:03,634
10-13.

1574
01:31:04,643 --> 01:31:06,838
Officer down.

1575
01:31:30,469 --> 01:31:33,529
I ain't going anywhere, Tom.

1576
01:31:33,572 --> 01:31:35,870
I ain't going anywhere.

1577
01:31:37,008 --> 01:31:39,841
It's okay.

1578
01:31:45,150 --> 01:31:47,880
3-4 squad, Central.
3-4 squad, Central.

1579
01:31:47,919 --> 01:31:50,410
10-13, officer down.
184th and St. Nick's.

1580
01:31:50,455 --> 01:31:53,185
Officer down, 10-13.
Hurry hurry hurry.

1581
01:31:53,225 --> 01:31:55,887
10-4, 4 squad...
– Tom, don't. Don't.

1582
01:31:55,927 --> 01:31:59,488
– Officer down. ETA six minutes.
– Don't.

1583
01:31:59,531 --> 01:32:02,159
Don't.

1584
01:32:14,379 --> 01:32:16,404
Don't.

1585
01:32:24,856 --> 01:32:26,949
3-4 squad, Central.

1586
01:32:26,992 --> 01:32:29,586
Central.
Go ahead, 4 squad.

1587
01:32:29,628 --> 01:32:32,153
That's a 10-55 on the bus.
Cancel the ambulance.

1588
01:32:32,197 --> 01:32:34,188
10-5?

1589
01:32:34,232 --> 01:32:37,292
Cancel the ambulance.
10-55 on the bus. Cancel the ambulance.

1590
01:32:37,335 --> 01:32:39,997
– You sure on that?
– Sure on that.

1591
01:32:49,147 --> 01:32:51,513
You did this, you know.

1592
01:32:53,084 --> 01:32:56,542
I know, partner, I know.

1593
01:32:59,691 --> 01:33:01,522
We did good, Tom.

1594
01:33:02,761 --> 01:33:05,195
Tom, Tommy.

1595
01:33:05,230 --> 01:33:08,961
We did good. We did good.

1596
01:33:10,669 --> 01:33:13,399
You're a good man, Tom.

1597
01:33:13,438 --> 01:33:15,872
You're a good man.

1598
01:33:17,242 --> 01:33:20,268
I wish you...

1599
01:33:20,312 --> 01:33:22,610
I wish you

1600
01:33:22,647 --> 01:33:25,741
continued success.

1601
01:34:07,459 --> 01:34:09,620
Some piece of work, your partner.

1602
01:34:09,661 --> 01:34:11,652
Lights.

1603
01:34:11,696 --> 01:34:13,493
Look, Cowen,

1604
01:34:13,531 --> 01:34:16,193
the way we see it,

1605
01:34:16,234 --> 01:34:19,203
Detective Fisk just closed the door
on the poetry boy.

1606
01:34:26,144 --> 01:34:29,307
Good. Whatever you say.

1607
01:34:32,150 --> 01:34:34,618
Are we done?

1608
01:34:34,653 --> 01:34:36,678
Yeah, we're done.

1609
01:34:58,777 --> 01:35:00,608
My daughter called.

1610
01:35:00,645 --> 01:35:04,308
She was upset about Rooster
and worried about me.

1611
01:35:04,349 --> 01:35:07,910
She asked me if I was likely
to do something stupid

1612
01:35:07,953 --> 01:35:10,513
and I said, "Like what,

1613
01:35:10,555 --> 01:35:13,581
take anger management classes
or retire?"

1614
01:35:13,625 --> 01:35:16,890
I said I was gonna do
the same old thing I always do.

1615
01:35:16,928 --> 01:35:20,830
She said, "Good.
What else could you do?"

1616
01:35:20,865 --> 01:35:22,526
I said, "Right."

1617
01:35:22,567 --> 01:35:25,593
A real chip off the old block,
my daughter.

1618
01:35:25,637 --> 01:35:28,868
She said I was a cop
and a good one.

1619
01:35:28,907 --> 01:35:32,468
Funny... Rooster said
the same thing.

1620
01:35:35,580 --> 01:35:38,845
Okay, guys,
let's get ready to play ball.

1621
01:35:38,883 --> 01:35:42,717
On the count of three.
Everybody in?

1622
01:35:42,754 --> 01:35:46,315
One, two, three, explosion!
