1
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:23,546
One

2
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,016
between the eyes!

3
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:27,178
Two

4
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,313
between the eyes.

5
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,081
- Out!
- What?

6
00:02:03,489 --> 00:02:05,423
- She was safe.
- She was out.

7
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,392
She landed right there.
She's safe.

8
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:11,690
Turk: Aw, come on.

9
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:14,393
Umpire: That's enough.
I don't want to hear another word.

10
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:16,698
- You're gone!
- Yeah, I'm gone.

11
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,207
My grandmother used to take
me to Washington Square Park...

12
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:31,550
to watch Bobby Fischer
play 10 games at the same time.

13
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:33,643
Queen me.

14
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:36,621
He was five-six moves ahead
on each table.

15
00:02:37,623 --> 00:02:40,114
Anyway, he became
the world champ, didn't he?

16
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:42,184
Then he lost his fucking mind.

17
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:48,160
He became a raving paranoid.

18
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:49,930
Being attacked
from all directions,

19
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:51,994
he couldn't see
what was in front of him.

20
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:01,307
Mate. Mate!

21
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,794
(both laugh)

22
00:03:31,677 --> 00:03:34,202
My name is David Fisk,

23
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:36,408
Detective First Grade.

24
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:40,484
I've been a cop in the NYPD
for over 30 years.

25
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:44,153
In that time...

26
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:48,226
I've killed 14 people.

27
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:52,120
Man: Run that by me
one more time.

28
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:55,692
I've killed 14 people.

29
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,396
He's nuts.

30
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:02,102
Turk's voice: When did
these things start?

31
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:08,373
How did they start?

32
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:16,751
Maybe this one started
with a guy named Charles Randall.

33
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:25,296
Randall was a child killer.

34
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:29,432
He killed his girlfriend's daughter

35
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:31,903
about four years ago.

36
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:35,264
Randall: Fuck you, damn asshole.

37
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:38,169
Turk's voice: He was tried
for the crime,

38
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,679
but was acquitted
by a jury of his peers.

39
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:58,322
My partner and I
found this unacceptable.

40
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:05,070
My partner is a good man.

41
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:28,686
Are you really
gonna do this thing?

42
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:30,753
Do what?

43
00:05:30,796 --> 00:05:33,230
You're going to
take down Randall

44
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:35,427
for a homicide
he didn't commit.

45
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:42,638
What am I gonna do?

46
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,666
You're my partner.

47
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:47,110
- You're my role model.
- Right.

48
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:49,137
What am I gonna do
without a role model?

49
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:55,350
We didn't have
this conversation.

50
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:57,879
What conversation?

51
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:18,772
Turk's voice: It got done.

52
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:26,109
Randall lost his freedom

53
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:28,120
for the crime he didn't commit.

54
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:36,052
Turk's voice: I lost my faith.

55
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:41,256
- I'm gonna go.
- Okay.

56
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:54,312
You can take this
as a confession if you want.

57
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:56,338
Whatever.

58
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:59,180
A few weeks ago
things heated up.

59
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:00,981
What do we got on him, Turk?

60
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:05,423
Marcus Smith, AKA Spider...
big big dope deals,

61
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,892
murders, extortion,
lots of nice things.

62
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,259
He converted
this old abandoned bank

63
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:12,423
into Club 404 of Harlem.

64
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:14,092
Maybe when he sees us
he'll confess.

65
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:16,101
What, you don't believe
in miracles?

66
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:17,727
When you pick up a check
one day...

67
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,102
one day,
then I'll believe in miracles.

68
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:23,267
- Let's go. I'm buying.
- Yeah, that's a miracle I want to see.

69
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:26,142
(crowd chattering,
distant music playing)

70
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:29,940
(hip-hop music playing)
#We fly high, no lie #

71
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:32,951
# You hear that?
You know this, balling #

72
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:35,954
# Foreign rides outside #

73
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:38,047
# It's like showbiz,
we in the building #

74
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,285
# We stay fly, no lie... #

75
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:42,089
Turk: This is where he launders
his money.

76
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:46,087
Rooster: Oh, yeah,
cleaning green green green.

77
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,327
Turk: He's all business.

78
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:51,566
I gotta take a leak.

79
00:08:01,313 --> 00:08:03,474
Oh, I'll just be a sec.

80
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:04,983
I'm not peeking.

81
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:07,417
No problem.

82
00:08:11,957 --> 00:08:14,482
- You guys are so lucky.
- Why is that?

83
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:16,825
No line to the bathroom and...

84
00:08:16,862 --> 00:08:18,727
(sniffs)

85
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:20,994
you get to pee standing up.

86
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:22,864
Unzip, psss, zip.

87
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:25,166
Badda boom badda bing,
you're out of here.

88
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:29,607
Yeah, the big guy really outdid himself
on this thing.

89
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:31,007
You want a bump?

90
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:32,977
Where did you get that from?

91
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,446
Spider. Supremo.

92
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:42,086
(train whistle blows)

93
00:09:04,643 --> 00:09:06,634
(door closes)

94
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:21,583
(muffled screams)

95
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:24,118
(crash, thumping)

96
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:38,867
(sighs)

97
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:45,874
Not bad.

98
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:49,183
Turk: Not bad?
What the fuck were you looking for?

99
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:51,621
Come on, Turk,

100
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:53,648
you pulled my hair.

101
00:09:53,692 --> 00:09:56,889
Gee, my little sister used to
pull my hair harder than that.

102
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,123
Whatever.

103
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:04,394
I gotta go.

104
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:17,846
- Where the fuck are you going?
- I'm tired.

105
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:20,545
You're tired?
It's America, you whiny bitch.

106
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:23,419
Why don't you fucking get in the cab
and do some honest work?

107
00:10:23,455 --> 00:10:26,322
Yeah, she's on her way.
She can't wait to see you.

108
00:10:26,358 --> 00:10:29,623
Rambo the Skateboard Pimp
was my 10th kill.

109
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:35,461
- (muffled gunshot)
- Think of me as a street-sweeper.

110
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:37,594
I cleaned up this worthless
piece of shit

111
00:10:37,636 --> 00:10:40,662
and left an obituary of sorts.
It rhymes.

112
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:51,914
Rooster, we gotta find out
who did this.

113
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:53,816
Give him a medal.

114
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:56,686
Hey, Rambo, you see
who did this?

115
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:58,690
He ain't talking, eh?

116
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:00,919
Real name Robert Brady.

117
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,951
Bobby Brady. Damn shame.

118
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,826
What are you thinking?
Marcia? Greg?

119
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:06,297
(both chuckle)

120
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,323
You guys messing up
my crime scene again?

121
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:10,494
You don't know
who Bobby Brady is?

122
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:12,527
Yeah, we met about an hour ago.

123
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:15,335
- It looks like close range.
- From the stippling around the wound

124
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:17,001
I'd say two to three feet away.

125
00:11:17,042 --> 00:11:19,772
We'll be fishing fragments
out of his brains.

126
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:21,871
- What?
- No, I just got that...

127
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:24,007
"Marcia? Greg?"
That's a good one, Rooster.

128
00:11:24,049 --> 00:11:25,778
Well, that was quick.

129
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:27,649
Just trying to keep pace with you.

130
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:34,952
Turk: "He trades in sin,
distributes flesh.

131
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:37,360
He picks the fruit
when it is fresh.

132
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:40,524
Now someone else
must slap his whore.

133
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:45,299
His heart has stopped.
He breathes no more."

134
00:11:47,172 --> 00:11:49,197
What do you want to do
about this?

135
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:52,039
I say let's make the best of it,

136
00:11:52,077 --> 00:11:55,205
canvass the hookers.
Maybe we'll meet one you like.

137
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:58,876
Please. I got all I can handle
from you-know-who.

138
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:00,715
No shit?

139
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:03,847
She's got my sperm level so low
I gotta sit down to take a piss.

140
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,550
Oh, thanks for that picture.

141
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:07,855
- Hey, what can I tell you?
- (laughs)

142
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:10,657
(Russian accent)
How can I help you, gentlemen?

143
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:12,721
We'd like to talk to you
about your boss.

144
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:15,029
He's upstairs.

145
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,399
No, your other boss.

146
00:12:21,206 --> 00:12:23,197
Rambo.

147
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,176
He is asshole.

148
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:28,373
Why "he is asshole"?

149
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,814
Follow me, please.

150
00:12:35,587 --> 00:12:37,214
You know anybody
who'd want to kill him?

151
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,917
Me.

152
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,255
Anyone else?

153
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:42,283
Why? He's dead?

154
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:43,989
(chuckles)

155
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:46,554
Hey, listen, you want to smarten up
and help us out

156
00:12:46,598 --> 00:12:48,293
or am I gonna have to call
somebody at ICE

157
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:50,097
and have you on the next plane
to kielbasa-land?

158
00:12:50,135 --> 00:12:51,966
Go ahead.

159
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:53,904
I am American citizen.

160
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,998
Yeah.

161
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,100
Lick my balls anytime.

162
00:12:58,143 --> 00:12:59,735
What?

163
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:01,769
Call us anytime, you know,

164
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:04,214
if you hear something, anything.

165
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:09,418
Rooster: I think we're looking
for a guy named Sam the Butcher.

166
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,923
- Who?
- (laughs)

167
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,221
Nah, he's kidding around.
But seriously, Lieutenant,

168
00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:16,284
how far do you want us to go
with this Rambo murder?

169
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:18,796
I don't know, I was thinking maybe
you could investigate it a bit more,

170
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:21,231
figure out who did it,
try to put him in jail.

171
00:13:21,266 --> 00:13:24,133
That is, if it doesn't get in the way
of your shuffleboard lessons.

172
00:13:24,169 --> 00:13:25,693
Yeah, no problem.

173
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:28,605
We're also working this dealer Spider
who's tied to these two stiffs

174
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,937
we found on Fresh Kills.

175
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:36,146
If we can nail him, who knows
how far up the ladder it will lead?

176
00:13:36,181 --> 00:13:37,307
So what about it?

177
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:39,044
I popped this lawyer
with an ounce of blow.

178
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:41,450
She practically shoved it up my nose.
I got her to flip on him.

179
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,148
Lucky fuck, eh?

180
00:13:43,188 --> 00:13:44,815
She scored it from him directly?

181
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:47,155
- Yeah, she did.
- Good.

182
00:13:47,192 --> 00:13:50,889
Okay, well, get what you can out of her
and kick her loose.

183
00:13:50,929 --> 00:13:53,365
I hate trying to prosecute
fucking lawyers.

184
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,198
(trains passing)

185
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:04,337
- This isn't Spider's club.
- The back way in.

186
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:08,403
Rooster: Yeah, it's an abandoned
linen factory, Jessica.

187
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:11,382
I guess I'm not your average...

188
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:12,907
what do you call it?

189
00:14:12,951 --> 00:14:14,942
- Rat?
- Stoolie?

190
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:16,978
Thanks.

191
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:20,719
I mean, I think usually
it's some poor African-American kid

192
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,989
or a junkie or a prostitute.

193
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,588
Well, normally 200-grand-a-year
corporate lawyers

194
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:28,566
are much smarter than your average
African-American junkie whore...

195
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,228
normally, but sometimes
they only think they are.

196
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,137
Man over radio: It's all set
on this end.

197
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:35,834
Are you guys sure
it's safe in there?

198
00:14:35,874 --> 00:14:38,934
Man: You tell your girlfriend
to grow a pair and let's go.

199
00:14:38,977 --> 00:14:42,037
What do you say, Counsel?
Are you ready to do this thing?

200
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:44,743
Yeah, let's get it over with.

201
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:47,752
Okay, remember what we said?
You go in there,

202
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:51,187
you wait for him to ask you
for what you need, right?

203
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,851
And then you don't come back here
with less than four ounces.

204
00:14:53,892 --> 00:14:55,359
- Four ounces?
- Yeah.

205
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:58,056
Isn't that a lot? I, like, buy a couple
of balls at the club, that's it.

206
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:01,066
You just say you're going skiing and
you need a week's worth of fresh powder.

207
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,432
Yeah, you tell him you're going
on vacation.

208
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:10,069
I do this thing
and my record's wiped clean?

209
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:11,406
As a whistle.

210
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:13,411
No one at my law firm will know
that I got busted, right?

211
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:14,969
It never happened.

212
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,379
Look, Counsel, we all know you
better than this.

213
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,011
You just do this, you stop
shoving that shit up your nose,

214
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:22,816
you go home, you get married,
you have kids,

215
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:25,517
you never come back here,
and that's that.

216
00:15:27,025 --> 00:15:29,357
Yeah.

217
00:15:29,394 --> 00:15:32,227
Officer: Everybody's in position.

218
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,732
- Turk: Okay, we're going.
- Officer: Yes, sir.

219
00:15:37,035 --> 00:15:39,697
Officer: Let's push the signal
back 50%.

220
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:42,731
Rooster: Hey, Jessica.

221
00:15:42,774 --> 00:15:44,241
Break a leg.

222
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,938
(radio chatter)

223
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:48,970
It's two flights down.

224
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:51,380
The door's on the left.
Ring the bell.

225
00:15:56,855 --> 00:15:58,379
(rings doorbell)

226
00:15:58,423 --> 00:16:00,891
Hey, Stubby, why don't you
go and escort our company up here?

227
00:16:02,694 --> 00:16:04,719
Go on, fat boy.

228
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,124
Get it on.

229
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:20,439
- Good afternoon.
- Hey, Spider.

230
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,970
- I'll be downstairs.
- All right.

231
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:25,040
- How are you?
- All right, baby,

232
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:27,449
just checking out this wizard shit
before I let my kids watch it.

233
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,954
- You seen this?
- No.

234
00:16:29,988 --> 00:16:32,456
The guy is a stone dealer.
I let my little ones watch this...

235
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,755
they'll all turn out junkies.
You know what I'm saying?

236
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:36,283
He's got a point.

237
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,523
- You remember Underdog?
- What about him?

238
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:41,499
That fucking dog spawned
a generation of junkies.

239
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:45,367
So you converted the bank
into a club and a recording studio?

240
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:47,964
- Yeah. You like it?
- Yeah.

241
00:16:48,006 --> 00:16:49,906
What are you talking about?

242
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:51,671
What did Underdog do
all the time?

243
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,405
He was always shining shoes

244
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:55,606
and whenever Sweet Polly Purebred
would call out to him,

245
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:57,615
his dog ears would pick it up
and he'd rescue her.

246
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:00,117
Yeah, but what did he do
when he needed his super strength?

247
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:02,313
He'd go to his ring, remember?

248
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,219
Pull out a pill, pop it.

249
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:07,748
Holy shit, you're right.
He was a little fucking speed freak.

250
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:09,124
Spider: So what's the business?

251
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:11,994
How about a QP?
You're good for a QP.

252
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,691
The fuck you want with QP?

253
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:16,360
I'm going skiing with friends,

254
00:17:16,401 --> 00:17:18,961
a lot of friends.

255
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:21,438
- Where?
- Aspen, Colorado.

256
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:24,203
Shit. I'm sure you can
score one in Aspen.

257
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:26,234
Not your primo brand.

258
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:28,679
You ski?

259
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,204
Sure. My whole life.

260
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:33,377
Come on, I don't have all day.

261
00:17:33,418 --> 00:17:35,750
Why don't you put down your jacket,
stay a little while?

262
00:17:35,787 --> 00:17:36,981
What do you think?

263
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:38,580
Jessica: Actually,
I've got to run.

264
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:42,526
I have a major IPO
closing in an hour, so...

265
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,291
You know, stress will kill you.
You gotta chill out.

266
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:48,599
I'm as chill as I get.

267
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:50,625
What do you want to do?

268
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:56,372
You know, every once in a while...

269
00:17:58,543 --> 00:18:00,602
one of you Upper East Side bitches
gets popped,

270
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,637
tries to to roll over
on a nigga like me.

271
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:04,774
You're scared now.

272
00:18:04,816 --> 00:18:07,979
(doorbell ringing)

273
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:12,047
Looks like the cavalry
come to rescue you.

274
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,580
Can I help you, gentlemen?

275
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,058
Yeah, let us in, Spider.

276
00:18:15,093 --> 00:18:17,288
I'm sorry, there's no one here
by that name.

277
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:20,230
- Let us in.
- We only want to talk to you.

278
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,893
(door buzzes)

279
00:18:22,934 --> 00:18:25,835
See, I know how to look
and I know where to look.

280
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,745
Come to papa.

281
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,108
It always hurts the first time.

282
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,747
Turk: You all right?

283
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,582
Why wouldn't she be all right?
We're watching TV.

284
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,281
How the fuck is she gonna get hurt
watching TV?

285
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:45,916
She could have seen or heard
something that scared her.

286
00:18:45,957 --> 00:18:47,857
- Like what?
- Like some big fucking mutt

287
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:49,417
shooting his bug fat
fucking mouth off.

288
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:52,328
Wasn't nobody here fitting that description
till a minute ago.

289
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:54,264
I'm gonna show you ugly,
you fucking mother...

290
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,767
- We've said enough.
- Oh, you finna bring your wife up in here?

291
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,862
That's it. That's it.
Let's go. It's okay.

292
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:02,635
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.

293
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:04,642
You want your wire back?

294
00:19:06,244 --> 00:19:08,109
Firearm!

295
00:19:08,146 --> 00:19:09,238
No, Stubby, no!

296
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:19,854
Get down.
Get the fuck down!

297
00:19:29,634 --> 00:19:31,101
Turk: Come on.

298
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:33,934
The fat one's dead.

299
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,138
(Jessica moaning)

300
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:44,447
Well, that went well.

301
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:48,218
Oh, shit, you're bleeding.

302
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:52,315
3-4 squad, Central.
11-41, request ambulance.

303
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:55,155
I need EMS. Subject shot,
184th and St. Nicholas.

304
00:19:55,193 --> 00:19:57,388
Really, I tried my best.

305
00:19:57,429 --> 00:20:00,728
You're doing just fine, Counsel.
You're doing just fine. Just relax.

306
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:03,860
Hey, guys, if you ever
need a lawyer...

307
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:06,632
Yeah, okay.

308
00:20:06,671 --> 00:20:09,139
You bet.

309
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,107
In good old days
we used to

310
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:16,876
let the perp bleed out
and call off the ambulance.

311
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:18,849
- Calm calm calm.
- Fucking lowlife.

312
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,681
You made your point.
You made your point.

313
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,017
Tough little bitch, ain't you,
kicking a man while he's handcuffed?

314
00:20:23,054 --> 00:20:25,545
Shut the fuck up,
you piece of shit.

315
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,217
You think I won't blow
your fucking head off?

316
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,022
I wouldn't think twice
about it.

317
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:31,324
I'd go in there,
get the fat boy's gun,

318
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:35,026
come back here
and put two between your eyes.

319
00:20:35,066 --> 00:20:37,000
(rapid footsteps)

320
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:41,829
Where's EMS?

321
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:45,070
Woman: This thing was a clusterfuck
to end all clusterfucks.

322
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,668
You got nothing.

323
00:20:46,711 --> 00:20:48,679
How about felony murder?

324
00:20:48,713 --> 00:20:51,204
No drugs, right?
So no predicate felony,

325
00:20:51,249 --> 00:20:53,149
no conspiracy,
no nothing.

326
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:55,210
No felony. No felony.
I can't believe this.

327
00:20:55,253 --> 00:20:56,982
No felony.
How do you spell felony?

328
00:20:57,022 --> 00:21:00,355
Homicide, racketeering, drugs...
I mean, what are we talking about?

329
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:03,020
Hey, you're lucky
that white girl didn't die.

330
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:04,961
IAB is gonna interview
both of you

331
00:21:04,996 --> 00:21:07,464
and do a preliminary report
over the next couple of weeks.

332
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:10,991
Now off the record
you actually didn't violate procedure

333
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:13,470
because the victim had a firearm
aimed at you,

334
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:15,735
so if you stick together
you should make it through this.

335
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,765
Lieutenant: You'd better get
your story straight too,

336
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:20,642
'cause I'm not going back to Far Rockaway
because you two fucked up.

337
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:23,273
And you're gonna spend some couch time
with the rubber-gun squad.

338
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:27,115
And you'd better take this shrink seriously
or you'll be off active duty.

339
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:28,915
That fucking piece of shit
just walks.

340
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,751
Knock it off, Turk.

341
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:35,886
Relax, partner.
He's gonna get his.

342
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:38,452
Man: Gentlemen, your questions.

343
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:40,897
- Who made the decision to enter?
- I did.

344
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:42,923
- Whose decision was it to enter?
- Mine.

345
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,266
Did you immediately identify yourselves
as police officers?

346
00:21:45,303 --> 00:21:47,601
- Yes, we did.
- Did you immediately identify yourselves?

347
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:50,130
The informant's position
was becoming untenable.

348
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:52,439
- We were afraid she was in danger.
- Turns out you were right.

349
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,968
- No fucking kidding, nine-to-fiver.
- Excuse me, Detective?

350
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:57,413
Are you finished
with my client?

351
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:03,343
- They're like Lennon and McCartney.
- Not an inch of daylight between them.

352
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:04,616
What do you think?

353
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:05,953
Nothing there.

354
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,858
They endangered the informant.
We can't make them wrong on that.

355
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:10,521
They saw a gun, they reacted.

356
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:12,325
They beat the fuck
out of the suspect,

357
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:14,457
but he's not filing charges.

358
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,558
Let's see what the shrink says.

359
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:19,969
So what are we gonna
do now, Doc?

360
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,200
Are we gonna find out
if I'm sane enough

361
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,970
to carry a gun,
chase bad guys?

362
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,604
Okay, why did you become a cop?

363
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:30,376
Well, it was New Year's Eve.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

364
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:34,317
I didn't have the same opportunities
you had, Dr. Prosky.

365
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:37,048
Where I come from
it was either a gun and a badge

366
00:22:37,088 --> 00:22:38,953
or a hard hat and a hammer.

367
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:41,458
How do you feel
when you fire your weapon?

368
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:44,223
It's like Dirty Harry said...
"There's nothing wrong

369
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:46,890
with a little shooting as long as
the right people get shot."

370
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:48,866
Prosky: And when the wrong people
get shot?

371
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,869
Turk: It sucks, but I'd rather be in it
that out of it.

372
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:53,996
There's nothing worse
than being stuck on a bench.

373
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,269
How do you feel when you see
innocent people get killed?

374
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:58,538
You know...

375
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:03,509
I sort of get numb to it.

376
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:06,210
Here.

377
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:07,741
I want you to take this.

378
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:11,153
Use it to jot down your thoughts,
your questions,

379
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:13,680
anything you may have noticed
about yourself,

380
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,192
whatever.

381
00:23:15,226 --> 00:23:17,057
I won't ask for it.

382
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:19,859
Just for you.

383
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:21,388
I want you to try it.

384
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:23,458
Sounds like fun.

385
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:28,898
(Karen panting)
Harder.

386
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:38,045
(crowd cheering)

387
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:44,919
Go, Turk, go!

388
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:49,351
You got third.
Go go!

389
00:23:49,394 --> 00:23:52,090
Yeah!
Look at that.

390
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,496
You own it. You own it.

391
00:23:54,532 --> 00:23:56,397
No matter what they say
about you,

392
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:58,527
you're tremendous!

393
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,937
Go go, Turk, go!

394
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,869
Safe.
You dropped the ball.

395
00:24:06,911 --> 00:24:09,243
- A fucking cheap shot, man.
- Get away from the bag.

396
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:12,215
- Or what? Or what? Or what?
- Watch the bag.

397
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:15,913
(all yelling)

398
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:26,296
Turk's voice: The NYPD is bubbling
with frustration,

399
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:27,923
hostility and testosterone,

400
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,957
ready to erupt
at any moment.

401
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:32,026
Think of me
as the release valve.

402
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,903
One flick of the trigger
and the pressure goes down.

403
00:24:34,939 --> 00:24:37,032
You know why
you join the force?

404
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:39,168
To get respect.

405
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:40,939
Most people respect the badge.

406
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:43,311
Everybody respects the gun.

407
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:50,744
Hey, Riley, I was talking to JD...

408
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:53,849
you guys caught a stiff named
Phillip Trager, a gun-runner?

409
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:56,122
Oh, yeah, a real piece of shit.

410
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,095
- How did that go down?
- I don't know.

411
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:00,393
Somebody gave him a taste
of his own medicine, I guess,

412
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:02,832
walked right into his apartment,
killed him with one of his own guns.

413
00:25:02,867 --> 00:25:05,131
Did the shooter leave a note
or anything?

414
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:08,139
Yeah, actually,
the shooter left a poem.

415
00:25:11,242 --> 00:25:13,767
He did?
No shit.

416
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:15,803
Yeah. Hey, Simon,

417
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:19,283
you remember that poem
from the Trager case?

418
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:23,345
What are you doing, man?

419
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:25,379
Turk's asking about it.

420
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:27,891
What the hell are you doing?

421
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:30,360
¿Qué mierda 'tas haciendo ahí, papá?

422
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:32,329
No le digas mierda a eso loco.

423
00:25:32,363 --> 00:25:35,992
Riley: Cálmate. He wants to hear
about the poem.

424
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,264
"Merchant of thieving class,

425
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:41,431
I slit his throat
and capped his ass.

426
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:42,940
I took his gun, I took his...

427
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:45,966
I took his life, I took his gun,
But too bad he's not the only one."

428
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:48,069
That's how it goes,
something like that.

429
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:50,411
It's not iambic pentameter,
but it rhymes.

430
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:52,439
- Rooster.
- Yo.

431
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:55,351
We're looking for the same guy.

432
00:25:55,386 --> 00:25:58,549
He knocked off a pimp named Rambo
a few weeks ago. When was yours?

433
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:01,115
Last week. We're running ours with the ATF
because of the guns.

434
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:04,219
We're back in business on the Rambo case.
Looks like the same guy knocked off

435
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:06,696
- a gun dealer on the three-three last week.
- No shit.

436
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:09,700
- What do you mean? That's our case.
- That's our case. You're taking our case.

437
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:12,202
Seniority, guys.
Tag along, you'll learn something.

438
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,398
Oh, tell me the guy's name
is Greg Brady.

439
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:16,407
Please. It is, isn't it?

440
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:19,001
Oh, somebody's knocking off
the Brady Bunch.

441
00:26:19,043 --> 00:26:22,911
Gotta be the Partridge Family.
(laughs)

442
00:26:22,947 --> 00:26:26,007
Turk's voice: Trager,
a gun-runner bites the dust...

443
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:28,109
number 11.

444
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:40,294
Karen: The bullet matched the.45
in Trager's apartment.

445
00:26:40,331 --> 00:26:42,799
That was no surprise.
So I ran it through ATF.

446
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:45,860
It's one of a batch of six
that was stolen from a gun shop

447
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:48,202
- in Virginia last month.
- Yeah, probably by Trager.

448
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:50,935
That's what they think.
He matches the description they have.

449
00:26:50,975 --> 00:26:53,671
It still doesn't help us find the guy.
It just helps us tie him to the victims,

450
00:26:53,711 --> 00:26:56,202
which he's already doing
with his little fucking poems.

451
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:59,307
- (phone ringing)
- Excuse me. Hello.

452
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:02,581
Hey, Turk, don't forget
we got a court date later.

453
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:05,783
So...

454
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:09,453
I heard he kicked the shit
out of that dealer you guys took down.

455
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:11,325
Spider.

456
00:27:11,362 --> 00:27:12,522
So?

457
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:16,690
Did he?

458
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:22,165
Yeah, he got him
down on the ground.

459
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:24,607
The guy was handcuffed.

460
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:28,704
And he just started
kicking him in the gut.

461
00:27:28,746 --> 00:27:31,146
And then

462
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:33,514
he gets down on the guy's chest

463
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:36,884
and he really starts smacking him

464
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:39,856
hard in the face over and over

465
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:41,882
and screaming at the top
of his lungs,

466
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:44,190
"I'm gonna break
your fucking face,

467
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:46,629
you little bitch!"

468
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:48,996
Then his eyes really started
to fill up.

469
00:27:49,033 --> 00:27:51,024
I mean, they get dark...

470
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:53,230
you know how he gets
the sort of rage in him.

471
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:57,034
I thought he was gonna
kill this guy.

472
00:27:58,409 --> 00:28:00,877
Really?

473
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:05,981
You're a bad little girl.

474
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:07,882
Hmm?

475
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,979
- I got work to do.
- You bet.

476
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:16,358
Woman: Counselor,
my hands are tied here.

477
00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:18,385
Without a secure
chain of custody,

478
00:28:18,429 --> 00:28:21,159
any evidence obtained
after the initial search

479
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,667
- must be excluded.
- You gotta be fucking kidding me.

480
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:26,067
Therefore I am forced
to grant defense

481
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:28,402
motion to dismiss
all charges

482
00:28:28,439 --> 00:28:30,634
of rape and assault
against Mr. Van Luytens.

483
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:32,666
- Your Honor.
- Judge: You think I want this guy

484
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,871
going anywhere
near my daughter,

485
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:37,074
or anyone's daughter
for that matter?

486
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:39,583
You messed up.
I am unleashing your client

487
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:41,881
unto the world.
I'm sure we'll all be

488
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,353
back here again very soon.

489
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:46,380
Look at him.
Look at this motherfucker.

490
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:50,019
Hey, it's gonna come back to you, mutt.
You're gonna get it.

491
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:52,495
- When you walk outside watch your back.
- Easy, Turk.

492
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:53,690
Order in my court.

493
00:28:53,731 --> 00:28:56,996
- Okay, mutt? You fucking mutt.
- Not here, not now.

494
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:59,469
Not here, not now.
Will you get him out of here

495
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:02,064
before somebody passes a sentence
on him you can't appeal?

496
00:29:02,106 --> 00:29:03,334
Order!

497
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:06,502
- You know what I mean? Go go.
- Order, Detective.

498
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:10,503
Turk's voice: Dr. Prosky suggested
that I free-associate.

499
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:12,948
So here I go.

500
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:15,612
You know what I think about
when I pull a trigger?

501
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:18,588
- I think about the Infield Fly Rule.
- (doorbell buzzes)

502
00:29:18,623 --> 00:29:21,649
I love that fucking rule.
It assumes the worst in everybody.

503
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:25,390
It says, "Sorry, batter, you're a schmuck
for popping up with runners on.

504
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,830
And you, stupid-ass infielder,
you don't get to cheat

505
00:29:27,865 --> 00:29:30,299
and drop the ball just because
you caught a break."

506
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:31,996
My favorite part...
the batter's out

507
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:34,197
but the runners advance
at their own risk.

508
00:29:34,238 --> 00:29:36,502
Well, isn't this
a pleasant surprise?

509
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:38,634
Turk's voice: That's the way
life should be.

510
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:40,667
You can be a motherfucker
at your own risk.

511
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:43,943
(muffled gunshots)

512
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:47,816
Or not.
Van Luytens... one less rapist.

513
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:50,082
Who's gonna miss him?
Nobody.

514
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:52,282
Number 12 and counting.

515
00:30:06,537 --> 00:30:08,437
Whoa whoa, hot coffee.

516
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,168
- Good morning, Detective Riley.
- Hey, good morning.

517
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:12,176
- Door on your left.
- Any signs of forced entry?

518
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,905
Doesn't look like it.
Detective Perez is in there.

519
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:15,344
He's in there already?
All right.

520
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,507
- Hey, how about those Mets last night?
- Yeah, how about 'em?

521
00:30:17,548 --> 00:30:19,607
Hey, Teddy, Teddy, come here,
check this out.

522
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:23,385
Wow.

523
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:24,649
Fuck.

524
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:27,487
- Oh my God.
- That's big.

525
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:29,516
And powerful.

526
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,427
- What, a plasma screen?
- LCD.

527
00:30:32,463 --> 00:30:34,522
- That's plasma.
- No, it's got to be LCD.

528
00:30:34,565 --> 00:30:36,863
- Perez: It wouldn't be that big.
- Hey, guys, guys.

529
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:40,337
He was shot at close range,
dropped right here.

530
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:43,135
The pussy doesn't look like he put up
much of a fight, does he, Karen?

531
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:45,233
Nothing to indicate that

532
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:48,803
in terms of struggle.
No forced entry, cuts, bruises.

533
00:30:48,846 --> 00:30:52,077
Hey, nobody wants to hear
about your private life, Officer Corelli.

534
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:55,347
That's detective to you,
Officer Needledick.

535
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:57,320
- Ooh.
- Perez: Ouch.

536
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:59,687
- Looks like it's our guy again.
- Who did you get this time?

537
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:01,385
This is Jonathan Van Luytens.

538
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:03,360
He owns a couple
of car dealerships.

539
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:05,726
- Oh, shit.
- He was up on rape charges,

540
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:07,958
but they got tossed out
last week.

541
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:09,990
Look at this.

542
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:14,130
"A man devoid of all respect,
Of beauty, charm or intellect,

543
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:16,606
He took what women
would not give.

544
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:18,575
He didn't have
the right to live."

545
00:31:18,609 --> 00:31:20,975
That's our boy all right.

546
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:24,175
Looks like he had a beef
with our old pal Jonny.

547
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,307
You know him?

548
00:31:25,349 --> 00:31:27,214
Both: Yeah.

549
00:31:27,251 --> 00:31:29,549
He's one slippery
son of a bitch, let me tell you.

550
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:32,255
Turk: Yeah.

551
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:35,418
Lieutenant: You guys know how much
fun it is to not catch a serial killer?

552
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,189
You got a point here, Lieutenant?

553
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,991
The point is

554
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,157
you'd better both
think seriously

555
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:43,292
about whether or not
you want the lead on this case.

556
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:44,995
You don't think
we're up to this?

557
00:31:46,003 --> 00:31:49,200
Come on, you got what,

558
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,936
about 110 years on the job
between the two of you?

559
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:55,036
- 120.
- (laughs)

560
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:57,343
I'm telling you, you screw it up
badly enough,

561
00:31:57,381 --> 00:31:59,576
they may try to fuck you
out of your pension.

562
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:00,845
You want to risk that?

563
00:32:00,885 --> 00:32:02,716
- Yeah.
- Fuck, yeah.

564
00:32:02,753 --> 00:32:07,713
406, Lieutenant. 406.

565
00:32:07,758 --> 00:32:10,352
Okay, 406...
what does that mean?

566
00:32:10,394 --> 00:32:11,918
Ted Williams.

567
00:32:11,963 --> 00:32:15,023
Ted Williams, the last day of the season,
is batting 400.

568
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:18,160
Sox manager wants to bench him,
protect his average, right?

569
00:32:18,202 --> 00:32:19,999
Williams plays
both games anyway,

570
00:32:20,037 --> 00:32:22,005
goes six for eight,
ends up at 406...

571
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:23,734
the last guy that ever hit
over 400.

572
00:32:23,774 --> 00:32:26,265
Okay, fine. It's all yours.

573
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:29,336
Just don't go moaning to me
when some traffic cop

574
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,678
pulls your serial killer over
for speeding

575
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:34,344
and he grabs your
15 minutes of fame and you realize

576
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:37,548
the asshole could have been
standing right there in front of you

577
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:40,648
and it would have taken you
1000 light years to nail him.

578
00:32:40,691 --> 00:32:42,420
Not for nothing, Lieutenant,

579
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:45,520
light years measures distance,
not time.

580
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:50,400
Well, thank you, Detective.
I'll make a note of that.

581
00:32:50,434 --> 00:32:53,267
Ellis Lynde, 2003.

582
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:56,068
This guy had a history
of cruising gay bars,

583
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:58,905
picking up twinkies,
beating the shit out of them.

584
00:32:58,943 --> 00:33:01,844
Lynde was found shot dead
in his apartment.

585
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:04,780
Whoever's doing this
gets up real close to the guys,

586
00:33:04,815 --> 00:33:07,477
blows their brains out
without any trouble,

587
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:09,008
leaves no fingerprints

588
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:10,850
and obviously
takes pride in his work.

589
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:15,188
Okay, what could be
murder number two back from '04,

590
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:16,659
one Matthew Mitrella.

591
00:33:16,694 --> 00:33:18,628
(trails off)

592
00:33:21,632 --> 00:33:23,759
Turk's voice: I was shaking
the first couple of times

593
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:26,634
I killed in cold blood.

594
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:30,004
I kept thinking if I got caught
they'd kick me off the force.

595
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:32,669
I wasn't worried about prison,
but losing the gun and the shield...

596
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:33,938
that scared me.

597
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:36,469
I went into work the next day
expecting to feel different.

598
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:39,608
I thought everybody would look at me
the way cops look at civilians

599
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,880
and know which ones are dirty.

600
00:33:48,859 --> 00:33:51,191
But they didn't.
That's when I knew

601
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:53,823
I could keep on
doing this forever.

602
00:33:56,968 --> 00:34:00,904
Turk's voice: So next stop... Spider.

603
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:02,929
If we shut down his business,

604
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:04,965
maybe he'd be a rat.

605
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:07,000
We got a lawyer.

606
00:34:07,044 --> 00:34:10,810
We needed her to testify
that she bought coke from him.

607
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:13,408
She was a good lawyer.

608
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:17,911
Me and my partner paid a visit
to Club 404 of Harlem.

609
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:19,081
A word about him...

610
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:22,217
Tom Cowen's been my partner
for almost 30 years.

611
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,194
He's the best cop
I've ever seen.

612
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:29,624
I'm always the one
following him through the door.

613
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:31,828
There's a bullet
that was meant for me

614
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:35,430
that's lodged in his torso.

615
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:37,532
He was my role model.

616
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,941
The day I stopped
trying to be Tom Cowen

617
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:42,445
was the greatest day
of my life.

618
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:59,286
Hey, Rooster,

619
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:02,356
I was going through the files
on poetry boy.

620
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,630
That's an interesting way
to pass your time.

621
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:07,103
Okay, there was a gun

622
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:09,299
found on Charles Randall
when he was arrested.

623
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,568
Yeah.

624
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:13,771
Now in all the other shootings
the gun was left at the scene,

625
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:16,974
but there are a lot of similarities.
So I mentioned it to Perez and Riley.

626
00:35:17,014 --> 00:35:19,073
I think somebody should go
interview him in prison.

627
00:35:19,116 --> 00:35:21,744
I think there may be a connection.

628
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:25,244
That's a good idea,
but not Perez and Riley.

629
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,723
I mean, not those guys.
They'll screw it up.

630
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:29,885
This is too important.

631
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:32,395
Turk and I will handle Randall, okay?

632
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:33,988
Good work.

633
00:35:57,455 --> 00:35:59,480
(door buzzes)

634
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:07,795
Detectives, Charles Randall.

635
00:36:09,633 --> 00:36:12,761
What the fuck
do you two scumbags want?

636
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:15,499
What a greeting.

637
00:36:15,539 --> 00:36:18,599
You like poetry, Chuck?

638
00:36:18,642 --> 00:36:19,700
What?

639
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:22,941
Do you like poetry?

640
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:27,678
Yeah.
Roses are red, violets are blue,

641
00:36:27,718 --> 00:36:30,653
I want to poke out your fucking eyes
with my dick, you fuck.

642
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,679
How's that?

643
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:35,351
I thought you'd rhyme.
You didn't.

644
00:36:35,393 --> 00:36:37,554
Fuck you.
Fuck both of you.

645
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:39,222
Get me out of here.

646
00:36:39,263 --> 00:36:42,164
(door buzzes)

647
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:45,691
(siren wailing)

648
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:49,172
(blues playing)

649
00:36:49,206 --> 00:36:51,504
Why the fuck did we even bother
going out there?

650
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,635
What would it look like
if we didn't go?

651
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:57,574
Are you gonna relax?

652
00:36:57,615 --> 00:36:59,606
Relax.

653
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:01,550
Yeah, I'll just take it out
on Karen later.

654
00:37:01,585 --> 00:37:03,883
The more I'm with her,
the more abuse she wants.

655
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:05,183
Sounds like fun.

656
00:37:05,222 --> 00:37:06,814
Hey, you want to take her
off my hands?

657
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:11,317
Be careful, partner, because I have
a very special effect on women.

658
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:12,556
Go wild.

659
00:37:12,596 --> 00:37:13,995
Whatever.

660
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:17,023
I can't believe I had to face
that piece of shit and look like an idiot.

661
00:37:17,067 --> 00:37:20,366
Eh, fuck him.
He's where he belongs.

662
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:22,031
I'm sorry, partner,
I'm really sorry.

663
00:37:22,072 --> 00:37:25,007
Stop worrying about it.

664
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:30,541
Whatever happens,
I'm not taking you down with me.

665
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:33,550
Don't worry about me.
I'm all right, believe me.

666
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:36,849
I don't know what I was thinking.
I just don't know what I was thinking.

667
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:39,219
You know what you was thinking?
You were thinking

668
00:37:39,256 --> 00:37:41,918
about a 10-year-old girl
who had her skull crushed.

669
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,395
Yeah, I tried to stop you,
but you know what?

670
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:49,695
I admired you that day,
what you did.

671
00:37:49,733 --> 00:37:52,702
That was righteous.

672
00:37:52,736 --> 00:37:56,570
And you don't second-guess yourself
on something like that.

673
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:05,572
Okay, I'm the killer.

674
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:08,141
I'm the killer.
I show up at your door

675
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:10,176
or your car window,

676
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:12,519
and for some reason
you open your door,

677
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:15,491
you roll down
your car window for me.

678
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:17,721
So who am I?

679
00:38:17,761 --> 00:38:20,127
Someone I know.

680
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:21,654
Maybe a nice set of tits.

681
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:23,792
And the poems?
What about the poems?

682
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:26,200
You have to compose the poem
before you got there, right?

683
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:28,228
Otherwise what, you're gonna
blow out the guy's brains,

684
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:30,137
sit down and write a little sonnet
for yourself?

685
00:38:30,174 --> 00:38:31,573
No prints on the poems,

686
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:34,601
so probably
I wore gloves when I wrote it.

687
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:37,705
You obviously know your victims.
Between that and the easy access,

688
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:40,080
I guess that they know you too.
They must.

689
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:42,551
These guys are all scumbags.
They're not gonna trust anyone,

690
00:38:42,586 --> 00:38:45,146
open the door for anyone,
especially if they don't know them.

691
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:47,521
Yeah, but I more than know them.

692
00:38:47,558 --> 00:38:49,890
I know everything about them.
I know their moves,

693
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:51,792
their patterns,
I know their schedules.

694
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:54,627
Okay, so you're following them.
You're staking them out.

695
00:39:07,878 --> 00:39:10,472
Anyone gonna say it?

696
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,448
What?

697
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:17,614
Fuck me.

698
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:21,155
- He's right, it's a cop.
- No.

699
00:39:21,191 --> 00:39:23,489
Let's slow down, fellows.
We're getting way ahead of ourselves.

700
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:27,122
- Come on, it's a cop, you know it.
- I don't know shit. Neither do you.

701
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:30,031
I'm telling your right now,
it's a cop, it's a cop, it's a cop.

702
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:31,762
What do you mean,
"It's a cop, it's a cop, it's a cop"?

703
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:35,067
- Where do you come off saying it's a cop?
- Easy, partner, he's just saying it.

704
00:39:35,105 --> 00:39:37,733
- What are you talking about?
- He's just saying...

705
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:41,074
I know, I know, I know
what he's saying.

706
00:39:42,746 --> 00:39:44,509
And I'm saying it's bullshit.

707
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:48,485
Shoot me. What the fuck?
But don't say it's a cop.

708
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:55,821
# You cast a spell on me #

709
00:39:55,859 --> 00:39:58,419
# I was blind and now I see #

710
00:39:58,462 --> 00:40:01,454
# You work your magic,
that's the key #

711
00:40:01,498 --> 00:40:04,058
# You wave your wand #

712
00:40:04,101 --> 00:40:07,662
# And cast a spell on me... #

713
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:09,696
Turk: So what about dinner?

714
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,332
You feel like going out?

715
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:13,172
Where?

716
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,075
I don't care.
You're the one going.

717
00:40:15,112 --> 00:40:16,943
What is your problem?

718
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:18,972
No problem.

719
00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:21,143
If you feel like hanging around,
be my guest.

720
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:22,516
I don't feel like going out.

721
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:25,716
Fine, just don't bug me.

722
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:29,886
This is the best part of my day
and I don't need you fucking it up.

723
00:40:31,695 --> 00:40:34,687
So you only fuck cops?

724
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:37,599
Once in a while
I do a fireman or an ex-con.

725
00:40:39,536 --> 00:40:41,197
You lump us in together?

726
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:43,365
Well, I have some respect
for firemen.

727
00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:45,204
Fuck you.

728
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:47,176
You know why they take away
your nightstick

729
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:49,441
- when you hang up your uniform?
- No.

730
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,675
They don't trust you with it.

731
00:40:51,715 --> 00:40:53,876
Right now I wouldn't trust
myself with it either.

732
00:40:53,917 --> 00:40:55,942
Shit, you'd probably love that.

733
00:40:55,986 --> 00:40:57,647
Too bad you never met
Van Luytens.

734
00:40:57,688 --> 00:40:59,383
You two really would have
hit it off great.

735
00:40:59,423 --> 00:41:01,584
At least somebody finally
brought some justice down

736
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,456
on that dickless little fuck.

737
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:05,792
Now that is who I'd like to meet.

738
00:41:05,829 --> 00:41:07,729
Well, maybe you'll get
your wish one day.

739
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:09,596
They think it's a cop.

740
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,260
- Makes sense.
- Bullshit.

741
00:41:11,301 --> 00:41:13,292
It's just some fucking psychopath.

742
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:15,669
Well, there's plenty of those
on the job.

743
00:41:24,114 --> 00:41:25,672
- Are you sleeping well?
- Not really.

744
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:27,240
- Yep.
- Eating well?

745
00:41:27,284 --> 00:41:28,751
- No.
- Yeah.

746
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:29,980
Any recurring nightmares?

747
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,511
Yeah, that I'm stuck
in a room with you forever.

748
00:41:33,724 --> 00:41:35,089
Nope.

749
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:36,922
Do you think you're fit
to return to duty?

750
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,951
- Abso-fucking-lutely.
- Yeah.

751
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:42,124
- You ever think about retiring?
- You mean, death with benefits?

752
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,963
What's not to like?

753
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,969
- You ever think about retiring?
- Not really.

754
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,994
What have I got to look forward to?

755
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:50,233
Sailing my 26-footer
around Sheepshead Bay,

756
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:51,707
umpiring cops' softball?

757
00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:53,835
- How about corporate security work?
- It's too dangerous.

758
00:41:53,877 --> 00:41:57,142
- So what are you gonna do?
- Maybe I'll buy a boat.

759
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,273
Turk: All right, look,
I don't know if I believe this,

760
00:41:59,316 --> 00:42:01,079
but I'm just gonna
throw it out there.

761
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:03,450
You guys say we're looking
for one of our own,

762
00:42:03,487 --> 00:42:07,446
but what if it was an ex-cop,
somebody with an axe to grind?

763
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:09,152
You got one in mind?

764
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:12,321
He's thinking about Martin Baum

765
00:42:12,362 --> 00:42:15,126
our old lieutenant.

766
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:17,531
So what's the story with him?

767
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:19,559
He got fired a few years ago.

768
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:22,800
I'm not saying there's any motive,
but he knew all the victims.

769
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:26,401
Yeah, but Turk,
I knew most of those guys.

770
00:42:26,443 --> 00:42:29,606
So did you, Riley, Perez.
Even Karen knew 'em.

771
00:42:29,646 --> 00:42:31,705
- I'm just throwing it out there.
- Well, maybe you killed 'em.

772
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:35,048
Yeah, maybe I did.

773
00:42:35,085 --> 00:42:37,246
The poems and the placement
of the weapons

774
00:42:37,287 --> 00:42:39,084
are all we've got
linking the kills,

775
00:42:39,123 --> 00:42:41,819
which means what we gotta do now
is get humping on the forensics.

776
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:44,225
That shouldn't be
too much of a problem.

777
00:42:44,261 --> 00:42:46,252
We already got the girl
working on that.

778
00:42:46,296 --> 00:42:50,062
That's right, Karen's been
humping on it all week, as we speak.

779
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,568
What did you say?

780
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:53,865
Here we go again.

781
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:55,667
- You should watch your mouth.
- Oh, yeah?

782
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:58,174
He didn't mean anything by it.
Karen and him are ancient history.

783
00:42:58,208 --> 00:43:00,369
- College boy can't speak for himself?
- Yeah, I can speak for myself.

784
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:02,207
Let me speak for myself...
fuck you, Turk.

785
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:04,214
Mutt, I'm gonna hit you
on the head with this barbell.

786
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:06,341
I'm not better than you.
You're not better than me, man.

787
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:08,078
You put your balls
in your pocket.

788
00:43:08,118 --> 00:43:09,779
And you, fellow officers,

789
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:14,018
a little courtesy
for a fellow professional, you know?

790
00:43:14,057 --> 00:43:17,083
Please. Are we gonna move on
here now?

791
00:43:17,127 --> 00:43:19,118
What are we doing?
Where were we?

792
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:22,724
Talking about Martin Baum.
What's his story?

793
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:25,257
Some guys under him
got caught taking money.

794
00:43:25,302 --> 00:43:27,566
Baum stood up for them,
tried to cover it up.

795
00:43:27,604 --> 00:43:30,004
He do time?

796
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,873
Well, they pressed charges,
but he plead out and resigned.

797
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:34,901
So what's his beef with you?

798
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:36,776
I could have lied to protect him,
but I didn't.

799
00:43:36,814 --> 00:43:39,806
Okay, but if he's got a beef with you,
why not go after you?

800
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:42,341
Why not kill you? Why go around
acting like a serial killer,

801
00:43:42,386 --> 00:43:44,251
killing all these degenerates?
It doesn't make any sense.

802
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:46,722
- I'm just telling you.
- I'm telling you it doesn't make sense.

803
00:43:46,757 --> 00:43:48,816
I'm throwing it out there.
I'm saying this is what it is.

804
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:50,952
You want to check him out or not?
I don't give a shit.

805
00:43:50,994 --> 00:43:53,519
- It doesn't make any sense.
- You're the ones that think it's a cop.

806
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:55,498
I'm just saying here's a cop
with a chip on his shoulder.

807
00:43:55,532 --> 00:43:57,523
Check him out if you want.
I don't give a shit.

808
00:43:57,568 --> 00:44:00,901
Calm down and give a better reason
why Baum could be a suspect, okay?

809
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:02,701
(door slams)

810
00:44:02,739 --> 00:44:05,173
PMS, gotta be.

811
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:14,850
- Hey, guys.
- What's going on?

812
00:44:14,885 --> 00:44:17,285
I came over to bring you
the FBI report

813
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,289
on the paper
and handwriting.

814
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:21,450
You don't have a problem
with me looking over the evidence

815
00:44:21,491 --> 00:44:23,925
that I collected and processed
for you, do you?

816
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:25,861
- No problem.
- Put it back, Karen.

817
00:44:25,896 --> 00:44:27,887
- This is fascinating.
- Let's go, come on.

818
00:44:27,931 --> 00:44:29,899
Come on, let's go, let's go.

819
00:44:29,933 --> 00:44:31,730
- What?
- Come on, let's go.

820
00:44:31,768 --> 00:44:33,793
Get your hands off me.

821
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:36,067
I'll give you a little privacy.
I don't want to interrupt anything here.

822
00:44:36,106 --> 00:44:37,903
Are you afraid of me
looking at your old case files?

823
00:44:37,941 --> 00:44:40,409
- Is that it?
- Okay, I'm gone. Enjoy.

824
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:42,435
- What?
- What is it with you?

825
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:44,504
- What is it with you?
- (door slams)

826
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:51,309
I'm sorry about last night, okay?

827
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:54,017
I really am. It's a habit.

828
00:44:54,057 --> 00:44:56,958
Habits can be broken, right?

829
00:44:56,994 --> 00:44:58,393
That's bullshit.

830
00:44:58,428 --> 00:44:59,690
No.

831
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:02,198
I'm totally serious, all right?

832
00:45:03,667 --> 00:45:05,965
It's not bullshit,

833
00:45:06,003 --> 00:45:07,994
really.

834
00:45:14,678 --> 00:45:17,146
Perez: Why do you think
Turk was so quick to take the lead

835
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:20,081
on the poetry case, huh?
To keep us from finding the killer, man.

836
00:45:20,117 --> 00:45:22,483
That's what I would do
if I was covering my tracks.

837
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:25,454
He sticks us on this Baum stakeout
'cause it's more misdirection.

838
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:26,649
Makes sense.

839
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:28,885
I hate that Turk, man.

840
00:45:35,565 --> 00:45:37,556
(buzzing)

841
00:45:57,554 --> 00:45:59,545
Hey, he's coming out.
He's coming out.

842
00:46:01,792 --> 00:46:04,124
Oh, at 2:45 in the morning.

843
00:46:07,397 --> 00:46:10,855
Is it killing time
or is he just killing time?

844
00:46:30,487 --> 00:46:32,978
Come on, Baum,
go kill someone already.

845
00:46:33,023 --> 00:46:35,548
Perez: Yeah, kill Turk, man.
He's the one setting you up.

846
00:46:35,592 --> 00:46:37,059
Do us all a favor.

847
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:44,690
Hey, did you see Turk's
marksmanship scores?

848
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,293
Did you see this?
It's ridiculous.

849
00:46:46,336 --> 00:46:48,236
Service... 99,
70 out of 100.

850
00:46:48,271 --> 00:46:51,707
Combat Association awards,
department commendations.

851
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:54,142
This guy could take out your left nut
at 50 yards.

852
00:46:57,414 --> 00:46:59,439
Perez: Did you see the computer
trajectories, man?

853
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:00,916
Not one stray slug.

854
00:47:00,951 --> 00:47:03,283
Even Berkowitz put a couple
in the Corinthian leather.

855
00:47:08,425 --> 00:47:10,893
Riley: What about Karen?
She come up with anything new?

856
00:47:10,927 --> 00:47:12,792
Perez: No, not yet.

857
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:14,797
If Baum kills somebody
I don't want us to be in the car

858
00:47:14,831 --> 00:47:17,197
waiting when it happens, okay?

859
00:47:19,036 --> 00:47:20,697
I'll go.

860
00:47:20,737 --> 00:47:22,728
Attaboy, Teddy, attaboy.

861
00:47:22,773 --> 00:47:24,138
I'm proud of you, son.

862
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:29,301
(lighter clicks)

863
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:37,513
(cocks gun)
You're Perez, right?

864
00:47:37,554 --> 00:47:38,885
Yeah.

865
00:47:38,922 --> 00:47:40,617
I'm Martin Baum.

866
00:47:44,227 --> 00:47:46,354
I got a permit for this.

867
00:47:46,396 --> 00:47:49,126
I work security
in the diamond district.

868
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:51,964
So you figure it's a cop
doing the poetry killings?

869
00:47:52,002 --> 00:47:54,869
Someone says, "Check out Baum.
He thinks he got a raw deal."

870
00:47:54,905 --> 00:47:57,339
That's what passes
for police work these days?

871
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:58,864
Do you think
you got a raw deal?

872
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:00,774
Damn straight.

873
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:03,143
- Life sucks.
- Yeah.

874
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:05,740
- Everything okay, Simon?
- Teddy, where the fuck were you, man?

875
00:48:05,782 --> 00:48:08,080
Anything else you want to tell us,
Lieutenant Baum?

876
00:48:08,118 --> 00:48:12,020
- I got something for you in my pocket.
- Huh-uh!

877
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:18,290
A passport, credit card receipts,
boarding passes.

878
00:48:18,328 --> 00:48:20,319
The day Brady was killed

879
00:48:20,363 --> 00:48:22,532
I was escorting a client
to Brazil.

880
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:29,964
Man: Judgment is
the dominion of the Lord.

881
00:48:30,006 --> 00:48:32,907
And if this person,
this worthless rapist

882
00:48:32,943 --> 00:48:35,468
or murderer,
as you describe him,

883
00:48:35,512 --> 00:48:38,913
if he is truly repentant
and seeks absolution,

884
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:41,315
it must be granted to him.

885
00:48:41,351 --> 00:48:43,785
Your name doesn't ring a bell,

886
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:48,086
but I've had so many
altar boys over the years.

887
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:50,821
(muffled gunshot)

888
00:48:52,195 --> 00:48:54,186
Turk's voice: So many altar boys

889
00:48:54,231 --> 00:48:56,927
that it's hard to remember
their names.

890
00:48:56,967 --> 00:49:00,027
My name is David Fisk,
Detective First Grade.

891
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:02,334
You may not
remember me now,

892
00:49:02,372 --> 00:49:05,535
but I guarantee you'll remember my name
for the rest of your life.

893
00:49:05,575 --> 00:49:09,443
Father Connell,
may he rot in hell.

894
00:49:09,479 --> 00:49:11,947
13 down, one to go.

895
00:49:11,982 --> 00:49:14,644
(bells tolling)

896
00:49:14,684 --> 00:49:17,050
(police radio chatter)

897
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:23,985
Karen: White underwear
below the knee.

898
00:49:24,027 --> 00:49:26,495
- (camera shutter clicking)
- Briefs-style.

899
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:28,964
Large tweezers.

900
00:49:28,999 --> 00:49:32,457
I am removing a card that has been
inserted in the rectum of the deceased

901
00:49:32,502 --> 00:49:36,529
and placing it
in a plastic evidence bag.

902
00:49:39,242 --> 00:49:42,973
- I'll be right back.
- All right.

903
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:47,276
Hey. It's another one,

904
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:49,512
handwritten.

905
00:49:52,789 --> 00:49:55,553
"The old man
who the children trust,

906
00:49:55,592 --> 00:49:59,221
Unable to control his lust,

907
00:49:59,262 --> 00:50:02,163
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

908
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:06,260
The church can't stop him.
Someone must."

909
00:50:07,637 --> 00:50:09,628
I'll see what else I can find.

910
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:17,476
What's the matter with you?

911
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:19,812
Father Connell gave me
my first communion

912
00:50:19,849 --> 00:50:22,613
back in Bensonhurst.

913
00:50:24,988 --> 00:50:27,479
Hey, guys.
Sorry we didn't get a chance to call.

914
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:30,584
- Yeah, I bet you are.
- Go over there, take a look around.

915
00:50:30,627 --> 00:50:32,754
We'll compare notes later, okay?

916
00:50:32,796 --> 00:50:35,924
Looks like our friend just settled
an old score with the priest,

917
00:50:35,966 --> 00:50:37,957
left him with his pants down.

918
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:39,628
- Come on.
- No, look.

919
00:50:39,669 --> 00:50:41,136
Come on, don't talk like that.

920
00:50:41,171 --> 00:50:43,139
- Hey, look for yourself.
- Have a little respect.

921
00:50:44,674 --> 00:50:47,871
Next thing they're gonna tell us
Lieutenant Baum was an altar boy here.

922
00:50:47,911 --> 00:50:51,347
Tell me about it.
These two guys fucking stink.

923
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:53,713
Look, Doctor,
you read the poems.

924
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,980
It is possible, right,
that this guy is a cop?

925
00:50:56,019 --> 00:50:58,385
I've never seen it.

926
00:50:58,421 --> 00:51:01,219
I've never even heard
about a cop serial killer.

927
00:51:01,258 --> 00:51:03,419
Come on, girls,
let's go, let's go.

928
00:51:04,427 --> 00:51:08,386
Yeah. Go go go go go
go go go go!

929
00:51:08,431 --> 00:51:09,455
Safe.

930
00:51:09,499 --> 00:51:11,967
Doc, give us a tip.
How are we gonna catch this guy?

931
00:51:12,002 --> 00:51:13,993
You don't have to worry
about that.

932
00:51:14,037 --> 00:51:15,698
He wants to get caught.

933
00:51:18,008 --> 00:51:20,670
You don't have any better place
to have lunch?

934
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:22,507
I wanted to thank you.

935
00:51:22,545 --> 00:51:24,274
What, about Spider?

936
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:25,975
Yeah.

937
00:51:26,016 --> 00:51:28,610
And for looking in on me
at the hospital

938
00:51:28,652 --> 00:51:30,176
and the encouragement.

939
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:31,517
Why would he want that?

940
00:51:31,554 --> 00:51:34,114
After a while
getting away with it isn't enough.

941
00:51:34,157 --> 00:51:36,148
Jessica: So is your daughter
on the team?

942
00:51:36,192 --> 00:51:39,025
No, she used to play,
but now she's 25, living in California,

943
00:51:39,062 --> 00:51:41,758
five years sober
and working as a nurse.

944
00:51:41,798 --> 00:51:43,959
And her mother?

945
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,025
Her mother died
when she was very young.

946
00:51:47,037 --> 00:51:49,972
Doctor: He wants everybody to know
that he got away with it,

947
00:51:50,006 --> 00:51:54,033
to show everybody
just how brilliant he is.

948
00:51:54,077 --> 00:51:57,240
Most of these killings were criminals
in Rooster's and his beat, right?

949
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,145
And then he all but threatens
to kill Van Luytens

950
00:51:59,182 --> 00:52:01,150
in front of hundreds of witnesses.
And then he sends us

951
00:52:01,184 --> 00:52:04,244
on this crazy wild goose chase
after Lieutenant Baum, didn't he?

952
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:06,278
- Yes, he did.
- Why would he do that? Why?

953
00:52:06,323 --> 00:52:08,848
You gotta show me more than that.
So far you got shit.

954
00:52:08,892 --> 00:52:10,484
- Give him more, man.
- You want more?

955
00:52:10,527 --> 00:52:13,155
- How about the church records?
- The very ones that Turk was

956
00:52:13,196 --> 00:52:15,130
so diligently pursuing.
How about that?

957
00:52:15,165 --> 00:52:18,066
It turns out our most recent victim,
the late Father Connell,

958
00:52:18,101 --> 00:52:20,831
was moved all over the place...
eight parishes in 20 years.

959
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:23,361
Why would they do that
with a Catholic priest? It's obvious.

960
00:52:23,406 --> 00:52:25,897
He's giving the children
more than communion behind the altar.

961
00:52:25,942 --> 00:52:28,376
Now Turk already admits
to knowing this guy as a child.

962
00:52:28,411 --> 00:52:29,742
It's very plausible.

963
00:52:31,181 --> 00:52:34,344
Lieutenant: This priest,
this Father Connell,

964
00:52:34,384 --> 00:52:36,079
he gave you your first
holy communion, eh?

965
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:37,245
He did.

966
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:40,518
Did he every try to do
anything inappropriate? I mean...

967
00:52:40,557 --> 00:52:42,548
I know what you mean.
No, never.

968
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:46,251
Okay, fine.
Is there any reason

969
00:52:46,296 --> 00:52:48,526
why somebody out there
might think that he did?

970
00:52:48,565 --> 00:52:50,123
No.

971
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:52,498
Am I a suspect here, Lieutenant?

972
00:52:53,536 --> 00:52:55,561
No,

973
00:52:55,605 --> 00:52:59,439
but these bodies
are starting to smell.

974
00:52:59,476 --> 00:53:02,070
A lot of it is drifting
in your direction.

975
00:53:02,112 --> 00:53:04,103
Drifting or being pushed?

976
00:53:04,147 --> 00:53:06,240
What can I say?

977
00:53:06,282 --> 00:53:08,716
You got connections
to most of these victims.

978
00:53:08,752 --> 00:53:11,687
You're not exactly
Mother Teresa.

979
00:53:12,989 --> 00:53:15,890
I never had any problem
with that priest.

980
00:53:15,925 --> 00:53:18,860
Okay. Okay, fine.

981
00:53:18,895 --> 00:53:21,625
That settles it.

982
00:53:27,771 --> 00:53:29,864
I had a talk with Riley and Perez.

983
00:53:29,906 --> 00:53:31,430
Good cops.

984
00:53:31,474 --> 00:53:33,942
Don't fuck around, okay?
Just listen.

985
00:53:33,977 --> 00:53:35,239
I'm listening.

986
00:53:35,278 --> 00:53:37,678
They think
Turk might be our guy.

987
00:53:41,584 --> 00:53:43,814
Oh, man. I gotta tell you,

988
00:53:43,853 --> 00:53:46,549
from where I'm sitting
that is so fucking funny.

989
00:53:46,589 --> 00:53:48,648
You can't take that seriously.

990
00:53:48,691 --> 00:53:51,660
Everybody has pretty much
accepted the fact

991
00:53:51,694 --> 00:53:54,254
- that we're chasing one of our own.
- But it ain't Turk.

992
00:53:54,297 --> 00:53:56,060
Sure as I'm sitting here
he ain't the guy.

993
00:53:56,099 --> 00:53:57,726
- You know that?
- Yes, I do.

994
00:53:57,767 --> 00:54:00,235
- How do you know that?
- Because I know it.

995
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:02,830
I know it to a moral certainty.

996
00:54:02,872 --> 00:54:04,339
Okay?

997
00:54:05,542 --> 00:54:07,533
This priest,

998
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:10,171
this Father Connell...

999
00:54:10,213 --> 00:54:12,511
he was Turk's priest
when he was a kid.

1000
00:54:12,549 --> 00:54:13,573
He told you that.

1001
00:54:13,616 --> 00:54:15,914
He didn't tell me this priest
was a child molester.

1002
00:54:15,952 --> 00:54:18,887
- I can't believe this bullshit.
- Believe it, all right?

1003
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:21,482
- Turk's a good guy.
- You understand?

1004
00:54:21,524 --> 00:54:23,788
- He's the best cop you got.
- Don't you tell me what I gotta do.

1005
00:54:23,827 --> 00:54:25,886
Don't you say a goddamn word
to him about this either,

1006
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:27,863
or you're finished.

1007
00:54:31,201 --> 00:54:34,693
(humming a tune)

1008
00:54:37,807 --> 00:54:39,798
Can I speak now?

1009
00:54:39,843 --> 00:54:41,640
Feel free.

1010
00:54:42,645 --> 00:54:46,479
He cares.
You know what I'm saying?

1011
00:54:46,516 --> 00:54:49,417
Turk cares about people.

1012
00:54:50,753 --> 00:54:53,745
I know he runs around
like a pit bull on crack sometimes.

1013
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:56,384
It doesn't matter.

1014
00:54:56,426 --> 00:54:58,690
He cares about protecting people.

1015
00:54:58,728 --> 00:55:00,787
And if you don't back him,

1016
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:04,701
you will regret it.

1017
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:25,881
(bangs)

1018
00:55:25,922 --> 00:55:27,412
Jesus.

1019
00:55:27,457 --> 00:55:29,186
Sorry.

1020
00:55:29,225 --> 00:55:31,921
I just never rattled
anyone's cage before.

1021
00:55:31,961 --> 00:55:35,021
- Got a minute?
- Yeah, what's up?

1022
00:55:35,064 --> 00:55:38,465
You know me and Turk
are buddies, right?

1023
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:39,991
Of course.

1024
00:55:40,036 --> 00:55:41,526
I'd do anything for him.

1025
00:55:41,571 --> 00:55:43,971
He would do anything for you.

1026
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:45,235
Would you?

1027
00:55:45,275 --> 00:55:46,799
Would I what?

1028
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:48,868
Would you do anything for him?

1029
00:55:52,415 --> 00:55:54,212
I don't know...
where is this going?

1030
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:56,275
He wants you
to have sex with me.

1031
00:55:58,421 --> 00:56:00,321
Really?

1032
00:56:02,225 --> 00:56:04,056
He wouldn't mind.

1033
00:56:04,093 --> 00:56:06,789
But that's not why I'm here.

1034
00:56:06,829 --> 00:56:09,491
Okay, why are you here?

1035
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:12,763
Where were you
the night Rambo was killed

1036
00:56:12,802 --> 00:56:15,771
and Trager?
Got an alibi for those nights?

1037
00:56:17,273 --> 00:56:20,504
I mean, did you know either one
those guys before they were murdered?

1038
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:23,512
Makes you uncomfortable
when I talk like that.

1039
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:26,344
You look like you're guilty.
You're not guilty.

1040
00:56:26,382 --> 00:56:28,475
I know that.
You didn't kill those guys, did you?

1041
00:56:32,155 --> 00:56:35,181
Now you know what Turk feels.

1042
00:56:39,228 --> 00:56:42,959
I need you to get me
some information

1043
00:56:42,999 --> 00:56:45,024
discreetly.

1044
00:56:46,669 --> 00:56:48,102
Can you do that for me?

1045
00:56:48,137 --> 00:56:50,401
You got it.

1046
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,101
Absolutely.

1047
00:56:52,141 --> 00:56:54,132
Let's solve these fucking murders.

1048
00:56:56,312 --> 00:56:58,473
(phone rings)

1049
00:56:58,514 --> 00:56:59,879
Oh.

1050
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:02,009
- Rooster: Hey, boy genius.
- Perfect timing, buddy.

1051
00:57:02,051 --> 00:57:04,076
Listen, you really worked
on Hingis, didn't you?

1052
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:05,815
He was all worked up
about my partner.

1053
00:57:05,855 --> 00:57:07,755
Good. He should be.

1054
00:57:07,790 --> 00:57:10,350
I think we should sit down,
see if we can square things, okay?

1055
00:57:10,393 --> 00:57:13,590
All right. Want to meet at Montrose
at 8:00 PM?

1056
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:16,929
Could you make that 9:00?
I gotta meet an old friend.

1057
00:57:16,966 --> 00:57:18,593
Yeah, sure, whatever you want.

1058
00:57:21,137 --> 00:57:24,436
(blues playing)
#Baby's got issues #

1059
00:57:24,474 --> 00:57:27,932
# Baby's got pains... #

1060
00:57:27,977 --> 00:57:29,968
- Hey, fellows.
- Hey.

1061
00:57:30,013 --> 00:57:33,176
Thanks for coming.

1062
00:57:33,216 --> 00:57:35,844
- This here is Cheryl Brooks.
- Hello, Cheryl Brooks.

1063
00:57:35,885 --> 00:57:37,876
Cheryl's got something to tell you.

1064
00:57:39,055 --> 00:57:42,684
My daughter Lynn

1065
00:57:42,725 --> 00:57:45,250
died four years ago.

1066
00:57:45,294 --> 00:57:48,229
She was 10 years old.
She was raped and she was murdered.

1067
00:57:50,333 --> 00:57:54,463
The guy I was living with,
Charles...

1068
00:57:54,504 --> 00:57:55,664
Charles Randall.

1069
00:57:55,705 --> 00:57:58,799
Yeah, Charles Randall... he did it.

1070
00:57:58,841 --> 00:58:01,639
Why are you telling us this?

1071
00:58:01,678 --> 00:58:04,806
Because he got off for that.
He was acquitted at trial.

1072
00:58:04,847 --> 00:58:07,077
- Because?
- Because?

1073
00:58:08,851 --> 00:58:11,149
I testified for him.

1074
00:58:11,187 --> 00:58:14,020
- You did what?
- I said he was with me.

1075
00:58:15,591 --> 00:58:19,288
You see, Cheryl here is
a very forgiving person,

1076
00:58:19,328 --> 00:58:21,626
unlike us hard-asses.

1077
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:23,928
- He threatened to kill me.
- Okay, Cheryl.

1078
00:58:23,966 --> 00:58:27,424
Now you say goodbye
to the nice officers

1079
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:31,304
and you go on back home.

1080
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:34,138
Don't drink yourself to death.

1081
00:58:36,245 --> 00:58:38,770
Okay, so...

1082
00:58:38,815 --> 00:58:41,181
eh?

1083
00:58:44,087 --> 00:58:46,817
I want to hear you say it.

1084
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:49,450
Come on, say it.

1085
00:58:53,896 --> 00:58:57,889
We planted the gun
in Randall's apartment, okay?

1086
00:58:57,934 --> 00:59:00,266
I said it. Happy?

1087
00:59:00,303 --> 00:59:01,895
- Thank you.
- Yes, I am.

1088
00:59:01,938 --> 00:59:04,702
I'd do it again if I had to
'cause that fucking maggot

1089
00:59:04,741 --> 00:59:08,541
could rot away for all eternity.
I'd sleep just fine.

1090
00:59:08,578 --> 00:59:09,977
So what do you want from us?

1091
00:59:10,012 --> 00:59:12,503
You guys think
my partner's a serial killer.

1092
00:59:12,548 --> 00:59:14,345
You're way off.

1093
00:59:14,383 --> 00:59:17,443
You like Turk for this thing?
Go have your fun.

1094
00:59:17,487 --> 00:59:19,887
I'll go along with you.

1095
00:59:19,922 --> 00:59:22,482
I'll even help you.

1096
00:59:22,525 --> 00:59:26,188
But do not drag up Chuck Randall
and that fucking gun,

1097
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:29,665
because if he walks out of jail
he's gonna end up dead.

1098
00:59:29,699 --> 00:59:31,758
Excuse me?

1099
00:59:33,336 --> 00:59:36,772
I'll put two
through his fucking head

1100
00:59:36,806 --> 00:59:39,366
myself.

1101
00:59:39,408 --> 00:59:41,672
Done deal.

1102
00:59:41,711 --> 00:59:44,839
(soprano singing)

1103
00:59:54,724 --> 00:59:57,659
My grandmother loved opera.

1104
00:59:57,693 --> 00:59:59,718
She supported us by sewing.

1105
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:02,856
I used to thread needles
for my grandmother.

1106
01:00:02,899 --> 01:00:05,197
- Gave all her money to church.
- You admired her?

1107
01:00:05,234 --> 01:00:07,361
I worshipped her.

1108
01:00:07,403 --> 01:00:10,201
Rooster? Yeah, he's religious,
goes to church.

1109
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:11,934
Prosky: How about you?

1110
01:00:11,974 --> 01:00:15,569
Turk's voice: Our job is keeping
99% of the population safe

1111
01:00:15,611 --> 01:00:19,047
from the other 1%.

1112
01:00:19,081 --> 01:00:22,676
The problem is that we have to
spend half our lives with that 1%.

1113
01:00:22,718 --> 01:00:24,515
And the better we do that job,

1114
01:00:24,554 --> 01:00:27,114
the less the other 99% think
they need us.

1115
01:00:27,156 --> 01:00:29,784
They're clueless.

1116
01:00:29,826 --> 01:00:31,760
The only ones paying attention
on the street

1117
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:34,194
are the cops and the criminals.
Everyone else is just

1118
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:36,994
going somewhere
or shopping.

1119
01:00:42,638 --> 01:00:44,833
- Umpire: Out.
- Come on.

1120
01:00:44,874 --> 01:00:47,365
I got an order here placing you
on restricted duty.

1121
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:49,901
Now in plain English that means
you'll work at your desk.

1122
01:00:49,946 --> 01:00:52,005
You might want to cooperate
with the shrink

1123
01:00:52,048 --> 01:00:54,812
next time you two meet,
and you will meet again.

1124
01:00:58,754 --> 01:01:01,689
Cool my fucking heels.
Cool my fucking heels, huh?

1125
01:01:01,724 --> 01:01:04,454
I'm gonna blow a fucking hole
in that motherfucker Perez

1126
01:01:04,493 --> 01:01:07,360
and blow right through his head
for putting me through this bullshit.

1127
01:01:07,396 --> 01:01:09,296
- Turk.
- Fuck, I'm gonna...

1128
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:10,629
kill that motherfucker.

1129
01:01:10,666 --> 01:01:13,464
Calm down. What the hell is it?
You're making all the wrong moves.

1130
01:01:13,502 --> 01:01:15,333
What are you talking about?
This ain't a chess game, partner.

1131
01:01:15,371 --> 01:01:17,805
Who knows? Maybe it is.
You go at Perez now...

1132
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:20,331
you know what's gonna happen?
You're gonna walk right into a trap.

1133
01:01:20,376 --> 01:01:22,537
You are.
They're just waiting for you.

1134
01:01:22,578 --> 01:01:24,273
Fucking Hingis.

1135
01:01:24,313 --> 01:01:26,577
Fucking Hingis believes him.

1136
01:01:26,616 --> 01:01:29,608
He actually fucking believes
that motherfucking Perez.

1137
01:01:29,652 --> 01:01:31,142
Stay back. Wait.

1138
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:34,623
Wait for the right time,
then fire away.

1139
01:01:34,657 --> 01:01:36,522
Not now. Now is not the right time.

1140
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:38,857
Believe me.

1141
01:01:38,895 --> 01:01:41,227
You believe me?
Now is not the time.

1142
01:01:41,264 --> 01:01:42,356
Uh-huh.

1143
01:01:42,398 --> 01:01:44,525
- Please.
- Yeah.

1144
01:01:44,567 --> 01:01:48,333
Hey, Turk, I gotta skip tonight.
My class ran late.

1145
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:50,771
(over phone) But I'll see you
tomorrow, all right?

1146
01:01:50,806 --> 01:01:53,707
And I'm sorry about what happened
with you and Lieutenant Hingis today.

1147
01:01:53,743 --> 01:01:55,870
It's gonna be fine.
It'll blow over.

1148
01:01:55,912 --> 01:01:58,847
People are just... everyone's crazy.
People are overreacting.

1149
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:01,543
All right? Good night.

1150
01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:09,951
It's a cop, it's a cop, it's a cop.

1151
01:02:16,732 --> 01:02:19,064
(car engine starts)

1152
01:02:19,101 --> 01:02:21,501
What you got for me, good-looking?

1153
01:02:26,709 --> 01:02:29,769
Mark my words, there's a reason
Perez is gunning for me.

1154
01:02:29,812 --> 01:02:32,542
- (tenor singing)
- Perez is too smart to be that stupid.

1155
01:02:32,581 --> 01:02:35,209
For one thing, all that college-boy crap...
that's bullshit.

1156
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:37,481
He did one year at SUNY,
only one year.

1157
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:38,509
No kidding.

1158
01:02:38,554 --> 01:02:40,954
They threw him out...
disruptive influence.

1159
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:43,686
And I hear from the 240 he mixed it up bad
with a captain over there.

1160
01:02:43,726 --> 01:02:45,956
The guy is a total
fucking asshole.

1161
01:02:45,995 --> 01:02:47,826
(man with Russian accent)
BMW 3 series,

1162
01:02:47,863 --> 01:02:50,195
Mercedes CLK... too light.

1163
01:02:50,232 --> 01:02:53,201
BMW 7 series...
the biggest engine.

1164
01:02:53,235 --> 01:02:55,897
That's what you have to get.
If they shoot at you,

1165
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:58,736
you still want
to get the fuck out of there...

1166
01:02:58,774 --> 01:03:00,435
(men laughing)

1167
01:03:00,476 --> 01:03:02,307
(imitating)
Bentley... very good

1168
01:03:02,345 --> 01:03:05,109
because can fuck two prostitutes
in back seat

1169
01:03:05,147 --> 01:03:08,878
and mount flame-thrower
on the hood. Da?

1170
01:03:08,918 --> 01:03:10,249
Da.

1171
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:12,618
- Man: What about a Cadillac?
- Russian: Come on,

1172
01:03:12,655 --> 01:03:16,147
the fucking car can't turn
fucking corner. Are you kidding me?

1173
01:03:16,192 --> 01:03:18,023
You know either one of those
Neanderthals?

1174
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:20,824
The wop is Joe Scianci from Bensonhurst.
He's a mid-level guy.

1175
01:03:20,863 --> 01:03:22,797
What about Ivan?

1176
01:03:22,832 --> 01:03:24,663
Russian guy,
Yevgeny Magulat,

1177
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:28,830
an enforcer for the Italians,
works with Gambinos a lot.

1178
01:03:30,006 --> 01:03:31,837
(speaking Russian)

1179
01:03:33,275 --> 01:03:35,937
That shit's getting to me.

1180
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:38,003
I know it's getting to you.

1181
01:03:39,749 --> 01:03:42,183
Shit gets to me too, you know,

1182
01:03:42,218 --> 01:03:45,312
but I take it in, I let it out
on my own terms.

1183
01:03:46,922 --> 01:03:48,981
I bet you didn't write
one word down

1184
01:03:49,025 --> 01:03:50,925
in that little notebook
Prosky gave us.

1185
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:53,520
Of course not. Did you?

1186
01:03:53,562 --> 01:03:55,894
Yeah, it's great.

1187
01:03:57,466 --> 01:03:59,832
It helps me put things in perspective.

1188
01:03:59,869 --> 01:04:03,862
You know what I'm saying?
Write it down, get it out.

1189
01:04:03,906 --> 01:04:06,431
- You should try this.
- Let's have a look.

1190
01:04:06,475 --> 01:04:09,103
What, are you kidding me?
Oh, come on, come on.

1191
01:04:09,145 --> 01:04:11,613
This belongs to me... private.

1192
01:04:11,647 --> 01:04:16,016
- You don't want to let me see?
- Close to my heart. No, sir.

1193
01:04:16,052 --> 01:04:18,247
I just got sick
of the whole fucking game...

1194
01:04:18,287 --> 01:04:20,755
run around looking for clues,
making arrests,

1195
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:23,315
write reports, testify, cut deals.

1196
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:26,260
It was all just so much
fucking bullshit.

1197
01:04:26,295 --> 01:04:29,128
(man whistles)

1198
01:04:29,165 --> 01:04:30,325
Detective...

1199
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:32,391
(muffled gunshots)

1200
01:04:36,072 --> 01:04:37,471
Then it all got real simple.

1201
01:04:37,506 --> 01:04:40,532
Yeah, Detective Perez here.
Hey, brother, what's up?

1202
01:04:40,576 --> 01:04:43,511
I hate scumbags. I like shooting people.
What was I giving up?

1203
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:46,538
Perez: Hey, look, I set the meeting up
with Rooster first thing tomorrow.

1204
01:04:46,582 --> 01:04:49,983
Come on, you gotta be fast, man.
I don't want Turk getting wind of anything.

1205
01:04:50,019 --> 01:04:52,385
A retirement party and a gold watch?

1206
01:04:52,421 --> 01:04:55,219
A handshake from the mayor
and my name on some fucking plaque?

1207
01:04:55,257 --> 01:04:57,987
(speaking indistinctly)

1208
01:04:58,027 --> 01:05:01,428
(gunshots)

1209
01:05:01,464 --> 01:05:02,658
Big fucking deal.

1210
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:05,924
It's better this way.

1211
01:05:07,736 --> 01:05:10,569
Now everybody knows
who I was and where I stood.

1212
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:52,274
(dials)

1213
01:05:54,049 --> 01:05:56,040
Hey, it's me.

1214
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:00,978
Listen, I think somebody
followed me here... home.

1215
01:06:01,023 --> 01:06:03,491
He's outside right now.

1216
01:06:03,526 --> 01:06:07,223
Can you come over or...?

1217
01:06:07,263 --> 01:06:10,323
Just call me back, okay?
All right.

1218
01:06:25,614 --> 01:06:28,048
(intercom buzzing)

1219
01:06:35,758 --> 01:06:37,749
(cocks gun)

1220
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:42,862
Don't move.

1221
01:06:55,744 --> 01:06:58,770
- Come on, open up.
- Turk?

1222
01:07:04,019 --> 01:07:06,180
I just called you.

1223
01:07:06,222 --> 01:07:07,814
Put the gun down.

1224
01:07:07,856 --> 01:07:09,847
There's a car following me.

1225
01:07:09,892 --> 01:07:12,656
Put the gun down.
Put the gun down.

1226
01:07:16,565 --> 01:07:18,055
Have you got
something to tell me?

1227
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:19,897
About what?

1228
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:22,495
Trager, Randall.

1229
01:07:22,538 --> 01:07:24,529
Did you sneak
into my apartment?

1230
01:07:24,573 --> 01:07:26,564
What are they doing
on your computer?

1231
01:07:26,609 --> 01:07:28,839
I was checking
all the links in the case.

1232
01:07:32,181 --> 01:07:33,876
Are you hiding something
from me?

1233
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:38,677
Huh?

1234
01:07:40,189 --> 01:07:43,056
I just received this... this poem.

1235
01:07:43,092 --> 01:07:45,686
A poem?
Not worth mentioning, huh?

1236
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:48,253
The handwriting
doesn't even match.

1237
01:07:48,297 --> 01:07:50,492
It's a fake.

1238
01:07:50,532 --> 01:07:52,523
Did you write it?

1239
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:56,930
Did you write it?

1240
01:08:01,143 --> 01:08:03,703
What the hell is going on here?

1241
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:05,907
You're spending a lot of time
with Perez, aren't you?

1242
01:08:05,948 --> 01:08:07,813
Yeah, I've been working the case.

1243
01:08:07,850 --> 01:08:10,011
What, are you jealous?

1244
01:08:10,052 --> 01:08:12,816
Can I trust you?

1245
01:08:14,957 --> 01:08:17,687
- Yes.
- Okay.

1246
01:08:17,726 --> 01:08:20,160
Get me anything and everything
that you can find out

1247
01:08:20,195 --> 01:08:22,629
about Perez or Riley,
what they know about me.

1248
01:08:24,366 --> 01:08:26,197
Everything.

1249
01:08:26,235 --> 01:08:28,703
Karen, don't play me.

1250
01:08:29,972 --> 01:08:33,635
Hingis: I am leaning much further
into saying that it is a cop.

1251
01:08:33,676 --> 01:08:37,009
Perez: Tell you what... I'm moving
past the leaning stage

1252
01:08:37,046 --> 01:08:39,844
and I'm moving towards the
l-know-for-sure-it's-a-fucking-cop stage,

1253
01:08:39,882 --> 01:08:42,214
considering how expertly
he shot the shit out of my house.

1254
01:08:42,251 --> 01:08:44,515
Hingis: Oh my God.
Are you hurt?

1255
01:08:44,553 --> 01:08:46,646
Am I hurt? Am I hurt?
He wants to know if I'm hurt.

1256
01:08:46,689 --> 01:08:48,787
Actually, he's dead.

1257
01:08:48,822 --> 01:08:50,885
(sirens wailing)

1258
01:08:50,926 --> 01:08:54,259
- Rooster: His name is Magulat.
- Turk: The guy we saw at Salerno's.

1259
01:08:54,296 --> 01:08:57,356
Yeah, he's in intensive care
at St. Luke's.

1260
01:08:57,399 --> 01:08:59,390
They think he's the guy

1261
01:08:59,435 --> 01:09:01,903
- chopped off Yakov Pearlstein's head.
- What do you think?

1262
01:09:01,937 --> 01:09:04,167
You think he's a victim,
or could he be our suspect?

1263
01:09:04,206 --> 01:09:07,232
I don't know, but either way
I think it's gonna be fun.

1264
01:09:08,277 --> 01:09:11,178
Doctor, what's the story?

1265
01:09:11,213 --> 01:09:14,205
He's one of the toughest human beings
I've ever come into contact with.

1266
01:09:14,249 --> 01:09:16,012
We took six bullets
out of him.

1267
01:09:16,051 --> 01:09:17,916
Six? Whoo!

1268
01:09:17,953 --> 01:09:20,717
Three from the night he was wounded,
three from previous shootings.

1269
01:09:20,756 --> 01:09:22,656
The man is a tank.

1270
01:09:22,691 --> 01:09:24,750
Do you mind if I talk to him
a little bit?

1271
01:09:24,793 --> 01:09:27,421
His jaw's wired shut,
but go ahead.

1272
01:09:27,463 --> 01:09:30,364
That's okay. I'll ask the questions.
He can just grunt.

1273
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:33,334
Hey, Yevgeny.

1274
01:09:33,369 --> 01:09:35,599
(snapping fingers)
Wake up.

1275
01:09:35,637 --> 01:09:40,336
That's it. Wake up,
you big fucking grizzly bear.

1276
01:09:40,376 --> 01:09:42,776
You don't speak Russian?

1277
01:09:42,811 --> 01:09:46,406
Swoboda. Swoboda. Swoboda.

1278
01:09:46,448 --> 01:09:48,939
Ron.

1279
01:09:51,553 --> 01:09:53,714
(moans)

1280
01:09:53,756 --> 01:09:56,987
I'm thinking this Russian killing machine
could be our first eyewitness.

1281
01:09:57,025 --> 01:09:59,721
(beeping more rapidly)

1282
01:09:59,762 --> 01:10:02,629
Wake up, gugumuck.
You can tell us who did this to you.

1283
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:10,305
- (grunting)
- Detective, I think that's enough.

1284
01:10:10,339 --> 01:10:13,797
Then you could tell us where you put
Yakov Pearlstein's head.

1285
01:10:15,177 --> 01:10:17,168
(laughs)

1286
01:10:17,212 --> 01:10:20,113
4-3, 4-3, I need a round-the-clock
security detail

1287
01:10:20,149 --> 01:10:24,415
on a patient Magulat,
M-A-gulat,

1288
01:10:24,453 --> 01:10:26,648
St. Luke's in the ICU.

1289
01:10:28,490 --> 01:10:32,358
# I wake up in the morning... #

1290
01:10:32,394 --> 01:10:35,659
Is this the number to call
to report a case of police brutality?

1291
01:10:35,697 --> 01:10:39,155
- Cat got your tongue?
- Out on bail again?

1292
01:10:39,201 --> 01:10:41,465
What, you think you can scare me,
little bitch? What do you want?

1293
01:10:41,503 --> 01:10:43,835
Be careful, Detective.
My taxes pay your salary.

1294
01:10:43,872 --> 01:10:46,466
You don't pay any fucking taxes,
you lowlife piece of shit.

1295
01:10:46,508 --> 01:10:48,874
- Get to the point, come on.
- One of your vics, Trager,

1296
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:51,539
stole a whole lot of guns
down South.

1297
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:53,673
Same guns are turning up
on your murder scenes.

1298
01:10:53,715 --> 01:10:55,012
So it's simple...

1299
01:10:55,050 --> 01:10:57,575
find stolen guns,
you got your guy.

1300
01:10:57,619 --> 01:10:59,450
So you know the guy?

1301
01:10:59,488 --> 01:11:02,286
Do you know if there's a cop out there
who might be a danger to the public?

1302
01:11:02,324 --> 01:11:05,088
I couldn't live with myself
if I just stood by and didn't say anything.

1303
01:11:05,127 --> 01:11:08,119
Look, I'm gonna give you
two seconds more. Give me yes or no.

1304
01:11:08,163 --> 01:11:11,098
Do you know the guy?
And when do I meet you to talk about it?

1305
01:11:11,133 --> 01:11:13,863
Friday, 9:00 PM, at my club.

1306
01:11:13,902 --> 01:11:15,062
I'll be there.

1307
01:11:15,103 --> 01:11:17,128
Man, there's dumb
and there's dumber,

1308
01:11:17,172 --> 01:11:19,640
but this is the motherfucking dumbest
right here, man.

1309
01:11:19,675 --> 01:11:21,836
Easy, son, easy.
It's gonna be easy for you.

1310
01:11:21,877 --> 01:11:25,472
All you gotta do is be bait, that's all.
Be a little sardine for us, all right?

1311
01:11:25,514 --> 01:11:28,176
You help us... we got you covered.
Your club doesn't get hassled

1312
01:11:28,217 --> 01:11:30,742
and you don't have a revolving door
in and out of jail.

1313
01:11:30,786 --> 01:11:32,378
Do we have a deal or not?

1314
01:11:32,421 --> 01:11:35,822
Yeah, but your boy come in here
and go Hannibal Lecter on my ass,

1315
01:11:35,858 --> 01:11:38,383
I don't want no Jodie fucking Foster
coming through the door.

1316
01:11:38,427 --> 01:11:40,258
I want the goddamn
Marine Corps, man.

1317
01:11:40,295 --> 01:11:43,924
# Since Color Me Badd was singing
"I wanna sex you up"...#

1318
01:11:47,436 --> 01:11:50,166
(footsteps)

1319
01:12:00,616 --> 01:12:02,641
(heart monitor beeping)

1320
01:12:12,961 --> 01:12:14,451
Evening, Detective.

1321
01:12:14,496 --> 01:12:17,713
You want one? It's shit,
but it's better than nothing, right?

1322
01:12:17,748 --> 01:12:20,930
Turk's voice: As soon as I heard
the fucking Russian didn't die

1323
01:12:20,969 --> 01:12:23,233
I knew things would never
be the same.

1324
01:12:23,272 --> 01:12:25,433
I had to change the rules,

1325
01:12:25,474 --> 01:12:27,465
the strategy.

1326
01:12:27,509 --> 01:12:31,275
I had to be bold, do something
that could never be undone.

1327
01:12:39,121 --> 01:12:41,423
I went for the unforgivable.

1328
01:13:02,611 --> 01:13:04,602
(Karen grunting)

1329
01:13:08,517 --> 01:13:11,213
No. Please. No.

1330
01:13:13,355 --> 01:13:15,789
(crying)

1331
01:13:33,241 --> 01:13:36,108
Karen over phone: Did you hear
anything I just said?

1332
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:41,010
How exactly could I be
blowing this out of proportion?

1333
01:13:41,049 --> 01:13:43,210
That psycho just assaulted me.

1334
01:13:43,251 --> 01:13:46,550
I am telling you
he is a classic sociopath.

1335
01:13:46,588 --> 01:13:48,715
Okay okay,
I'll look into it, all right?

1336
01:13:48,757 --> 01:13:50,247
I'll look into it.

1337
01:13:50,292 --> 01:13:52,453
You stay the hell away from here.
Understood?

1338
01:13:52,494 --> 01:13:54,291
Understood?

1339
01:13:56,365 --> 01:13:57,696
Fuck that.

1340
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:11,409
Man: Check the ball,
check the ball.

1341
01:14:11,446 --> 01:14:12,879
(players chattering)

1342
01:14:12,914 --> 01:14:14,529
I got the ball. I got the ball.
I got the ball.

1343
01:14:14,530 --> 01:14:16,145
Stay on him.
Stay on him.

1344
01:14:16,184 --> 01:14:18,118
Karen: Excuse me,
I'm Detective Corelli.

1345
01:14:18,153 --> 01:14:21,088
- I need to see your reservation book.
- Woman: Sure. Help yourself.

1346
01:14:28,530 --> 01:14:30,760
- Thank you.
- Anytime.

1347
01:14:30,799 --> 01:14:32,494
Yes, this is Detective Corelli.

1348
01:14:32,534 --> 01:14:34,968
I've been trying to reach
Detectives Perez and Riley

1349
01:14:35,003 --> 01:14:36,937
and I can't seem
to locate them.

1350
01:14:36,972 --> 01:14:39,964
- Perez: I like to party.
- That's nothing. I was into Kiss.

1351
01:14:40,008 --> 01:14:41,999
I used to run
around the house

1352
01:14:42,044 --> 01:14:44,171
with my tongue hanging out,
spitting fake blood.

1353
01:14:44,212 --> 01:14:45,509
I need to speak to them
urgently.

1354
01:14:45,547 --> 01:14:47,742
(police siren whooping)

1355
01:14:49,351 --> 01:14:52,752
Yes, I understand,
but I need the location, please.

1356
01:15:16,812 --> 01:15:18,109
(buzzes)

1357
01:15:21,316 --> 01:15:23,807
Hey, he's here.

1358
01:15:23,852 --> 01:15:25,046
Turk: Let me in.

1359
01:15:30,525 --> 01:15:32,822
Thank God it's the police.

1360
01:15:32,861 --> 01:15:35,193
Yeah, so where do we go?

1361
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:37,164
Follow me.

1362
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:39,497
I used to play ball
a couple of blocks from here.

1363
01:15:39,534 --> 01:15:40,762
Get the fuck out of here.

1364
01:15:40,802 --> 01:15:43,737
When I was a kid I wasn't afraid
to mix it up with guys like you.

1365
01:15:43,772 --> 01:15:45,069
You still ain't.

1366
01:15:45,107 --> 01:15:47,632
Yeah, nowadays
I carry a gun with me.

1367
01:15:47,676 --> 01:15:50,941
It's a bad neighborhood.

1368
01:15:50,979 --> 01:15:52,970
- It ain't bad for me.
- Yeah, well...

1369
01:15:53,014 --> 01:15:55,414
Yeah, he's inside.

1370
01:15:55,450 --> 01:15:57,008
Well, so far so good.

1371
01:15:57,052 --> 01:15:59,646
So now that we're done with
the pleasantries, what do you got for me?

1372
01:15:59,688 --> 01:16:00,916
Rooster: He's talking.

1373
01:16:00,956 --> 01:16:02,947
- What did you think he was gonna do?
- Spider: How about an apology?

1374
01:16:02,991 --> 01:16:05,755
Spider: The shit that happened to Stubby,
that wasn't supposed to happen.

1375
01:16:05,794 --> 01:16:07,557
Rooster: Lieutenant,
that's a crock of shit.

1376
01:16:07,558 --> 01:16:09,321
I lost three fucking teeth that day.

1377
01:16:09,364 --> 01:16:11,628
He's not a civilian.
He's a fucking dealer.

1378
01:16:11,666 --> 01:16:13,725
- And I kept my mouth shut.
- So what?

1379
01:16:13,769 --> 01:16:17,068
You guys love those stupid gold teeth.
You should thank me.

1380
01:16:17,105 --> 01:16:19,938
Well, he's wearing a vest
and Starsky and Hutch here

1381
01:16:19,975 --> 01:16:23,001
are watching him like a couple
of hawks... gay hawks.

1382
01:16:23,044 --> 01:16:26,207
- Yeah, right there, buddy.
- (chuckles)

1383
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:29,217
All right, enough bullshit.
So you know our poetry boy?

1384
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:31,242
Just talk to me.
What do you got for me?

1385
01:16:31,286 --> 01:16:33,345
- All right, here we go.
- Here we go.

1386
01:16:33,388 --> 01:16:34,855
Would you please?

1387
01:16:34,890 --> 01:16:37,723
Just 'cause the guy's talking tough,
that don't mean shit.

1388
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:39,556
Let me ask you something,
Copernicus.

1389
01:16:39,594 --> 01:16:42,188
That gun on his belt...
do you think it's a service pistol?

1390
01:16:42,230 --> 01:16:44,892
I bet you we'll trace it back to Trager's.
What do you think about that?

1391
01:16:44,933 --> 01:16:46,662
- What do you want to bet?
- 500 bucks.

1392
01:16:46,701 --> 01:16:48,828
- You're on.
- I'm in for another five.

1393
01:16:48,870 --> 01:16:51,236
Oh, this is fun.

1394
01:16:51,273 --> 01:16:53,468
Look, I help you,
you reciprocate.

1395
01:16:53,508 --> 01:16:54,975
So help me.

1396
01:16:55,010 --> 01:16:57,308
All right, you might see
a little bit of a cell-phone video.

1397
01:16:57,345 --> 01:16:59,404
I got it in front of Trager's
the night he bought it.

1398
01:16:59,447 --> 01:17:01,381
- You got what?
- I got a movie...

1399
01:17:01,416 --> 01:17:04,908
a couple of kids back from the prom,
preserving their special memories,

1400
01:17:04,953 --> 01:17:06,648
a positive ID of you, big time.

1401
01:17:06,688 --> 01:17:08,849
- Oh, yeah? Of me?
- Yeah.

1402
01:17:08,890 --> 01:17:10,619
Okay.

1403
01:17:10,659 --> 01:17:12,183
Now you know
what I'm talking about.

1404
01:17:12,227 --> 01:17:14,593
Yeah, now I got it.

1405
01:17:14,629 --> 01:17:16,563
Yeah, well,
so how do I look?

1406
01:17:19,634 --> 01:17:21,192
Like a poet?

1407
01:17:22,204 --> 01:17:23,865
'Cause that's what I am,
you know, a poet.

1408
01:17:23,905 --> 01:17:26,601
All right, come on, let's go.

1409
01:17:26,641 --> 01:17:29,269
In fact, I wrote a poem for you, Spider.
Want to hear it?

1410
01:17:29,311 --> 01:17:31,245
Eh?

1411
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:33,509
(cocks gun)

1412
01:17:33,548 --> 01:17:35,072
(door crashes open)

1413
01:17:35,116 --> 01:17:38,608
Drop your gun right now, motherfucker!
Drop to the ground right now!

1414
01:17:38,653 --> 01:17:40,484
Oh! Oh! Grease me up and...

1415
01:17:40,522 --> 01:17:42,581
I mean, do they actually pay
you two morons?

1416
01:17:42,624 --> 01:17:45,889
- Put the fucking weapon on the ground.
- Gladly. Gladly. Right there.

1417
01:17:45,927 --> 01:17:47,895
Right there. There you go.

1418
01:17:49,064 --> 01:17:50,964
Hey, you want to read my poem?

1419
01:17:50,999 --> 01:17:52,432
Easy easy.

1420
01:17:52,467 --> 01:17:53,764
Here, read it.

1421
01:17:55,937 --> 01:17:58,201
"You tried to set me up, you fucks,

1422
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:00,037
And this is how you do it?

1423
01:18:00,075 --> 01:18:02,805
You thought I'd get
my dick cut off,

1424
01:18:02,844 --> 01:18:05,404
Instead you only blew it."

1425
01:18:05,447 --> 01:18:07,472
- (both laugh)
- Great stuff.

1426
01:18:07,515 --> 01:18:09,881
- What is that shit?
- Thank you.

1427
01:18:09,918 --> 01:18:12,352
That is poetry.

1428
01:18:12,387 --> 01:18:14,116
What are you doing here?

1429
01:18:14,155 --> 01:18:15,986
Well, don't look at me, partner,

1430
01:18:16,024 --> 01:18:18,515
but I tagged along
to protect your ass

1431
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:21,893
and to see the look on their faces.
It was worth it.

1432
01:18:21,930 --> 01:18:24,296
We're doing our jobs here, okay?
I'm not gonna apologize for that.

1433
01:18:24,332 --> 01:18:26,960
I never want you to apologize, Teddy.
There's a killer out there with a badge.

1434
01:18:27,002 --> 01:18:29,163
- What are you morons doing about it?
- What do you think we're doing here?

1435
01:18:29,204 --> 01:18:31,069
- That's not it.
- No, that's not it.

1436
01:18:31,106 --> 01:18:33,006
I just made 1000 bucks.

1437
01:18:33,041 --> 01:18:34,906
Where's the other gun?
Give it to me.

1438
01:18:34,943 --> 01:18:36,740
Why don't you frisk me, Sherlock?
Go ahead.

1439
01:18:36,778 --> 01:18:38,973
- Frisk me, go ahead. Go ahead.
- Yeah, I'm gonna frisk you.

1440
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:44,712
Ooh, nice touch, Mary.

1441
01:18:44,753 --> 01:18:46,914
What are you doing after work?
Unless you're committed.

1442
01:18:46,955 --> 01:18:49,185
I don't want to get
in the middle of anything.

1443
01:18:49,224 --> 01:18:50,839
What happened to your face?

1444
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:52,455
Your mick friend give
you a little love bite?

1445
01:18:52,494 --> 01:18:55,861
- Shut the fuck up. Shut your fucking face.
- Hey hey hey! Whoa!

1446
01:18:55,897 --> 01:18:58,627
I'll blow your brains out
if you don't get the fuck away.

1447
01:18:58,667 --> 01:19:00,828
- What's he talking about?
- (all yelling)

1448
01:19:00,869 --> 01:19:02,666
- What's he talking about?
- What he's talking about is,

1449
01:19:02,704 --> 01:19:05,036
just 'cause you didn't go for this
doesn't mean you're not our guy.

1450
01:19:05,073 --> 01:19:07,439
- Now we gotta break this shit up.
- Don't translate for me, man.

1451
01:19:07,475 --> 01:19:10,103
Rooster: Will you let this go?
You fucked up, okay?

1452
01:19:10,145 --> 01:19:12,670
- We fucked up 'cause you helped him.
- I'm gonna nail your ass.

1453
01:19:12,714 --> 01:19:15,080
I'm not through with you, man.
Make a mistake.

1454
01:19:15,116 --> 01:19:17,107
Rooster: I'm gonna
break this stuff down, okay?

1455
01:19:17,152 --> 01:19:19,382
You fucking dog.

1456
01:19:20,922 --> 01:19:23,686
Relax, Spider.

1457
01:19:23,725 --> 01:19:26,057
Come on, let's have a drink.

1458
01:19:26,094 --> 01:19:29,655
I saw what I think
is a refrigerator here.

1459
01:19:33,868 --> 01:19:35,529
I'll be back in a second.

1460
01:19:44,479 --> 01:19:45,969
Hey, muffinhead.

1461
01:19:49,184 --> 01:19:50,651
Is this the person
who shot you?

1462
01:19:51,653 --> 01:19:53,587
You're sure?

1463
01:19:57,292 --> 01:19:59,283
(chuckles)

1464
01:19:59,327 --> 01:20:01,352
No, you're the pumpkinhead.

1465
01:20:06,701 --> 01:20:08,692
(Spider chuckling)

1466
01:20:12,607 --> 01:20:14,575
You miss me?

1467
01:20:16,611 --> 01:20:18,943
"...of death and pain,

1468
01:20:18,980 --> 01:20:21,141
Place oneself among the slain.

1469
01:20:21,182 --> 01:20:23,707
If one addiction goes unfed,

1470
01:20:23,752 --> 01:20:26,050
The world is better with him dead."

1471
01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:45,867
Take it easy.

1472
01:20:45,907 --> 01:20:47,670
It's okay.
It's gonna be all right.

1473
01:20:47,709 --> 01:20:49,939
Jesus Christ, Rooster.

1474
01:20:49,978 --> 01:20:52,845
Just move into the room. Here.

1475
01:20:52,881 --> 01:20:55,349
Sit down. Sit down.

1476
01:20:58,253 --> 01:21:00,244
Okay.

1477
01:21:00,288 --> 01:21:03,985
You gotta know about this,
Tom, from me.

1478
01:21:04,025 --> 01:21:07,119
Now just open that little book,
start reading.

1479
01:21:07,162 --> 01:21:09,630
Everything you want to know
is in there.

1480
01:21:11,666 --> 01:21:13,657
So go ahead.

1481
01:21:15,236 --> 01:21:17,227
Out loud.

1482
01:21:18,573 --> 01:21:20,666
For the record.

1483
01:21:20,708 --> 01:21:23,472
See the little video here?

1484
01:21:29,884 --> 01:21:33,251
"My name is David Fisk,
Detective First Grade.

1485
01:21:33,288 --> 01:21:37,349
I've been a cop in the NYPD
for nearly 30 years."

1486
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:41,987
- Dave, Dave, Dave, Dave.
- Tom,

1487
01:21:42,030 --> 01:21:45,124
we've got a lot to cover
and not much time to do it in, so...

1488
01:21:48,403 --> 01:21:51,600
"My name is David Fisk,
Detective First Grade."

1489
01:21:51,639 --> 01:21:54,164
My name is David Fisk.

1490
01:21:54,209 --> 01:21:57,235
"I've been a cop in the NYPD
for nearly 30 years."

1491
01:21:57,278 --> 01:22:00,145
I don't expect you
to remember me.

1492
01:22:00,181 --> 01:22:02,206
I mean, it's been a long time

1493
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:06,050
since you sat me on your lap
and told me you loved me.

1494
01:22:06,087 --> 01:22:09,147
"In that time

1495
01:22:09,190 --> 01:22:11,920
I've killed 14 people."

1496
01:22:13,027 --> 01:22:15,018
Rooster: But I guarantee

1497
01:22:15,063 --> 01:22:18,226
you're gonna remember the name
for the rest of your life.

1498
01:22:28,743 --> 01:22:32,338
"You don't become a cop
because you want to serve and protect.

1499
01:22:33,781 --> 01:22:36,841
You join the force because they let you
carry a gun and a badge.

1500
01:22:36,885 --> 01:22:39,547
Most people respect the badge.

1501
01:22:39,587 --> 01:22:41,680
Everybody respects the gun."

1502
01:22:41,723 --> 01:22:44,556
I'm the killer.
I show up at your door.

1503
01:22:44,592 --> 01:22:47,425
Turk: What are you talking about?
It's not a fucking chess game.

1504
01:22:47,462 --> 01:22:50,556
Who knows? Maybe it is.
You're making all the wrong moves.

1505
01:22:50,598 --> 01:22:52,793
I'm gonna put two
through his fucking head

1506
01:22:52,834 --> 01:22:55,166
myself.

1507
01:22:55,203 --> 01:22:57,364
I know it to a moral certainty.

1508
01:22:57,405 --> 01:22:59,930
You sort of get numb to it.

1509
01:23:09,484 --> 01:23:12,214
"Tom Cowen was my role model.

1510
01:23:22,297 --> 01:23:24,595
The day I stopped trying to be him

1511
01:23:24,632 --> 01:23:26,964
was the greatest day of my life.

1512
01:23:31,005 --> 01:23:34,304
Several years back I framed
a lowlife child killer

1513
01:23:34,342 --> 01:23:37,004
named Charles Randall.

1514
01:23:38,780 --> 01:23:41,180
I should have known
it would come back to haunt me."

1515
01:23:45,386 --> 01:23:47,752
What do you want me
to do with this?

1516
01:23:49,557 --> 01:23:51,991
Is that all you got to say?

1517
01:23:52,026 --> 01:23:54,256
I owe you this explanation, pal.

1518
01:23:54,295 --> 01:23:56,320
Why are you telling me now?

1519
01:23:56,364 --> 01:24:00,698
Ivan the Terrible
is gonna wake up pretty soon

1520
01:24:00,735 --> 01:24:02,532
and he's gonna ID me.

1521
01:24:08,109 --> 01:24:09,940
Evening, Detective.

1522
01:24:09,978 --> 01:24:12,947
You want one? It's shit,
but it's better than nothing, right?

1523
01:24:12,981 --> 01:24:17,145
I can just walk right in here.
Your partner's asleep. Step outside.

1524
01:24:17,185 --> 01:24:20,018
Did I ever pick
the wrong fucking Russki to shoot?

1525
01:24:29,397 --> 01:24:31,797
Now we're going off the record.

1526
01:24:34,335 --> 01:24:38,135
Uh, I'm going to take the rap
for the Randall gun thing.

1527
01:24:38,172 --> 01:24:40,003
You saw that.

1528
01:24:40,041 --> 01:24:43,204
I mean, considering
the circumstances, why not?

1529
01:24:43,244 --> 01:24:45,712
No need to thank me.

1530
01:24:46,914 --> 01:24:48,848
That business about not being me...

1531
01:24:48,883 --> 01:24:50,373
Yeah.

1532
01:24:50,418 --> 01:24:52,386
I don't get that.

1533
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:56,413
Well, you're a great cop, Tom.

1534
01:24:56,457 --> 01:24:58,448
I mean, you were the one

1535
01:24:58,493 --> 01:25:01,553
I aspired to all my life
and could never be.

1536
01:25:03,131 --> 01:25:05,531
Then you broke the law,

1537
01:25:05,566 --> 01:25:08,729
planted the gun on Randall,

1538
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:12,035
let me down.

1539
01:25:13,775 --> 01:25:15,709
I lost my faith.

1540
01:25:17,278 --> 01:25:21,237
That's when it all started.

1541
01:25:21,282 --> 01:25:23,944
And once it did,

1542
01:25:23,985 --> 01:25:26,010
I couldn't stop.

1543
01:25:27,388 --> 01:25:31,085
Finally,

1544
01:25:31,125 --> 01:25:33,616
I didn't want to.

1545
01:25:40,034 --> 01:25:43,595
So I did my own thing.

1546
01:25:43,638 --> 01:25:46,232
And you know what? In the end

1547
01:25:46,274 --> 01:25:48,572
it got done.

1548
01:25:48,609 --> 01:25:51,134
The scum went down.

1549
01:25:51,179 --> 01:25:53,044
And that's it. That's that.

1550
01:25:54,582 --> 01:25:56,880
I don't understand
a word you said,

1551
01:25:56,918 --> 01:25:59,079
- don't understand any of it.
- I know you don't, Tom.

1552
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:01,816
As soon as I heard
the Russian didn't die

1553
01:26:01,856 --> 01:26:04,222
I knew I had to change the rules,

1554
01:26:04,258 --> 01:26:07,091
do something that could
never be undone.

1555
01:26:07,128 --> 01:26:09,187
I went for the unforgivable.

1556
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:14,424
No.

1557
01:26:15,903 --> 01:26:18,167
So what am I gonna do, my friend,

1558
01:26:18,206 --> 01:26:20,834
partner? Arrest you?

1559
01:26:20,875 --> 01:26:23,742
At some point I gotta call it in.

1560
01:26:23,778 --> 01:26:25,177
We're a team.

1561
01:26:25,213 --> 01:26:26,908
We were.

1562
01:26:26,948 --> 01:26:28,939
Yeah, we were, a great team.

1563
01:26:28,983 --> 01:26:31,474
That was yesterday, Dave.

1564
01:26:31,519 --> 01:26:32,645
Today...

1565
01:26:34,756 --> 01:26:37,725
today you're pointing a gun at me.

1566
01:26:42,163 --> 01:26:45,291
(cocks gun)
But it hasn't gone off yet.

1567
01:26:50,671 --> 01:26:52,161
Bye, Tom.

1568
01:26:52,206 --> 01:26:54,299
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.

1569
01:26:54,342 --> 01:26:57,345
To hell, I suppose.

1570
01:27:44,025 --> 01:27:46,050
- Hey, Dave, Dave.
- Whoa.

1571
01:27:46,093 --> 01:27:48,653
Don't come closer!

1572
01:27:48,696 --> 01:27:51,028
- You wouldn't.
- You want to bet your life on it?

1573
01:27:51,065 --> 01:27:53,033
Come on, partner, I know you.
You wouldn't.

1574
01:27:53,067 --> 01:27:55,433
(Karen cocks gun)
But I would.

1575
01:27:55,470 --> 01:27:56,698
Oh.

1576
01:27:56,737 --> 01:27:58,728
Karen, just take it easy.

1577
01:27:58,773 --> 01:28:00,798
- Can't get me out of your mind?
- Shut up, Dave.

1578
01:28:00,842 --> 01:28:04,869
You're gonna defend
this lowlife piece of shit?

1579
01:28:04,912 --> 01:28:07,847
- Boy, I'm in your head.
- I'm not defending him. Take it easy.

1580
01:28:07,882 --> 01:28:11,045
Fuck you, Turk.
Put the gun down, Fisk.

1581
01:28:11,085 --> 01:28:12,552
- And if I don't?
- Dave.

1582
01:28:12,587 --> 01:28:15,351
- How about I blow your brains out?
- Ooh, I like the sound of that.

1583
01:28:15,389 --> 01:28:17,323
- Don't move.
- Karen.

1584
01:28:17,358 --> 01:28:19,758
You blow me away, Turk dies.
Is that your idea?

1585
01:28:19,794 --> 01:28:21,125
I said don't move, you prick.

1586
01:28:21,162 --> 01:28:23,460
Bye-bye!

1587
01:28:25,132 --> 01:28:26,724
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun.

1588
01:28:28,402 --> 01:28:30,097
Stay here.

1589
01:28:36,878 --> 01:28:38,277
Oh, man.

1590
01:28:39,614 --> 01:28:40,876
Fuck.

1591
01:28:42,416 --> 01:28:44,316
- (train passing)
- These old locks...

1592
01:28:44,352 --> 01:28:46,047
I mean, they're good.

1593
01:28:46,087 --> 01:28:48,055
Dave, you've got to end
this thing.

1594
01:28:48,089 --> 01:28:50,148
End it?

1595
01:28:50,191 --> 01:28:51,488
Put the gun down.

1596
01:28:51,526 --> 01:28:54,324
What's your plan?

1597
01:28:54,362 --> 01:28:56,660
Are you gonna arrest me?

1598
01:28:56,697 --> 01:28:59,530
Are you gonna take me down
to the precinct, book me,

1599
01:28:59,567 --> 01:29:03,230
fingerprint me,
body-cavity-search me?

1600
01:29:03,271 --> 01:29:05,136
What the fuck
are you gonna do?

1601
01:29:05,172 --> 01:29:08,107
wheel me out on the "Geraldo" show,
a freak of the week?

1602
01:29:08,142 --> 01:29:12,841
Or better yet, an in-depth
psycho profile on "Oprah"?

1603
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:15,178
Are you ready for that?
It ain't gonna fly, man.

1604
01:29:15,216 --> 01:29:17,582
Dave, you give me no choice.

1605
01:29:17,618 --> 01:29:19,449
You got a choice... I escape.

1606
01:29:21,022 --> 01:29:23,286
Would you do that for me, Tom?

1607
01:29:24,392 --> 01:29:25,620
Would you let me escape?

1608
01:29:25,660 --> 01:29:27,184
Come on, don't do this.

1609
01:29:27,228 --> 01:29:29,560
I'm gonna make a run for it.

1610
01:29:29,597 --> 01:29:31,792
What do you think?

1611
01:29:31,832 --> 01:29:34,824
You gotta do the right thing.

1612
01:29:40,841 --> 01:29:42,900
That's a 10-10, partner...

1613
01:29:42,944 --> 01:29:46,311
shots fired, suspect fleeing.
Let's go!

1614
01:29:46,347 --> 01:29:47,974
Come on, don't go there.

1615
01:29:49,483 --> 01:29:52,543
Hey, partner, come on.
Shots fired.

1616
01:29:52,587 --> 01:29:55,021
- Don't do this.
- Suspect fleeing,

1617
01:29:55,056 --> 01:29:57,490
resisting arrest. Come on.

1618
01:30:06,901 --> 01:30:09,802
A righteous man

1619
01:30:09,837 --> 01:30:12,567
Before me stands,

1620
01:30:12,607 --> 01:30:16,976
A hero in these filthy lands.

1621
01:30:17,011 --> 01:30:20,412
A brother in arms,

1622
01:30:20,448 --> 01:30:23,906
In heart are you.

1623
01:30:23,951 --> 01:30:26,613
I was really hoping

1624
01:30:26,654 --> 01:30:29,316
You'd get it too.

1625
01:30:32,793 --> 01:30:35,353
- I do get it.
- No, you don't.

1626
01:30:35,396 --> 01:30:37,330
No, I get it.

1627
01:30:43,671 --> 01:30:46,936
You know, the only thing
in this life

1628
01:30:46,974 --> 01:30:49,807
that ever gave me
any satisfaction

1629
01:30:49,844 --> 01:30:51,744
was killing those fucks.

1630
01:30:53,681 --> 01:30:56,013
So this is for real.

1631
01:30:56,050 --> 01:30:58,416
I mean,

1632
01:30:58,452 --> 01:31:00,784
this one is bad.

1633
01:31:02,957 --> 01:31:04,584
10-13.

1634
01:31:05,593 --> 01:31:07,788
Officer down.

1635
01:31:07,828 --> 01:31:10,695
(train passing)

1636
01:31:31,419 --> 01:31:34,479
I ain't going anywhere, Tom.

1637
01:31:34,522 --> 01:31:36,820
I ain't going anywhere.

1638
01:31:37,958 --> 01:31:40,791
It's okay.

1639
01:31:46,100 --> 01:31:48,830
3-4 squad, Central.
3-4 squad, Central.

1640
01:31:48,869 --> 01:31:51,360
10-13, officer down.
184th and St. Nick's.

1641
01:31:51,405 --> 01:31:54,135
Officer down, 10-13.
Hurry hurry hurry.

1642
01:31:54,175 --> 01:31:56,837
- Dispatcher: 10-4, 4 squad...
- Tom, don't. Don't.

1643
01:31:56,877 --> 01:32:00,438
- Officer down. ETA six minutes.
- Don't.

1644
01:32:00,481 --> 01:32:03,109
Don't.

1645
01:32:15,329 --> 01:32:17,354
Don't.

1646
01:32:25,806 --> 01:32:27,899
3-4 squad, Central.

1647
01:32:27,942 --> 01:32:30,536
Dispatcher: Central.
Go ahead, 4 squad.

1648
01:32:30,578 --> 01:32:33,103
That's a 10-55 on the bus.
Cancel the ambulance.

1649
01:32:33,147 --> 01:32:35,138
Dispatcher: 10-5?

1650
01:32:35,182 --> 01:32:38,242
Turk: Cancel the ambulance.
10-55 on the bus. Cancel the ambulance.

1651
01:32:38,285 --> 01:32:40,947
- You sure on that?
- Sure on that.

1652
01:32:50,097 --> 01:32:52,463
You did this, you know.

1653
01:32:54,034 --> 01:32:57,492
I know, partner, I know.

1654
01:33:00,641 --> 01:33:02,472
We did good, Tom.

1655
01:33:03,711 --> 01:33:06,145
Tom, Tommy.

1656
01:33:06,180 --> 01:33:09,911
We did good. We did good.

1657
01:33:11,619 --> 01:33:14,349
You're a good man, Tom.

1658
01:33:14,388 --> 01:33:16,822
You're a good man.

1659
01:33:18,192 --> 01:33:21,218
I wish you...

1660
01:33:21,262 --> 01:33:23,560
I wish you

1661
01:33:23,597 --> 01:33:26,691
continued success.

1662
01:34:08,409 --> 01:34:10,570
Some piece of work, your partner.

1663
01:34:10,611 --> 01:34:12,602
Lights.

1664
01:34:12,646 --> 01:34:14,443
Look, Cowen,

1665
01:34:14,481 --> 01:34:17,143
the way we see it,

1666
01:34:17,184 --> 01:34:20,153
Detective Fisk just closed the door
on the poetry boy.

1667
01:34:27,094 --> 01:34:30,257
Good. Whatever you say.

1668
01:34:33,100 --> 01:34:35,568
Are we done?

1669
01:34:35,603 --> 01:34:37,628
Yeah, we're done.

1670
01:34:43,477 --> 01:34:45,638
(children playing)

1671
01:34:59,727 --> 01:35:01,558
Turk's voice: My daughter called.

1672
01:35:01,595 --> 01:35:05,258
She was upset about Rooster
and worried about me.

1673
01:35:05,299 --> 01:35:08,860
She asked me if I was likely
to do something stupid

1674
01:35:08,903 --> 01:35:11,463
and I said, "Like what,

1675
01:35:11,505 --> 01:35:14,531
take anger management classes
or retire?"

1676
01:35:14,575 --> 01:35:17,840
I said I was gonna do
the same old thing I always do.

1677
01:35:17,878 --> 01:35:21,780
She said, "Good.
What else could you do?"

1678
01:35:21,815 --> 01:35:23,476
I said, "Right."

1679
01:35:23,517 --> 01:35:26,543
A real chip off the old block,
my daughter.

1680
01:35:26,587 --> 01:35:29,818
She said I was a cop
and a good one.

1681
01:35:29,857 --> 01:35:33,418
Funny... Rooster said
the same thing.

1682
01:35:36,530 --> 01:35:39,795
Turk: Okay, guys,
let's get ready to play ball.

1683
01:35:39,833 --> 01:35:43,667
On the count of three.
Everybody in?

1684
01:35:43,704 --> 01:35:47,265
One, two, three, explosion!

1685
01:35:59,954 --> 01:36:01,951
(instrumental music playing)
