1
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:22,546
One

2
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,016
between the eyes!

3
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:26,178
Two

4
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,313
between the eyes.

5
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:59,081
- Out!
- What?

6
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:04,423
- She was safe.
- She was out.

7
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,392
She landed right there.
She's safe.

8
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:10,690
Turk: Aw, come on.

9
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:13,393
Umpire: That's enough.
I don't want to hear another word.

10
00:02:13,434 --> 00:02:15,698
- You're gone!
- Yeah, I'm gone.

11
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:26,236
My grandmother used to take me
to Washington Square Park...

12
00:02:28,082 --> 00:02:30,550
to watch Bobby Fischer
play 10 games at the same time.

13
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:32,643
Queen me.

14
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:35,621
He was five-six moves ahead
on each table.

15
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:39,114
Anyway, he became
the world champ, didn't he?

16
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,184
Then he lost his fucking mind.

17
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:47,160
He became a raving paranoid.

18
00:02:47,201 --> 00:02:48,930
Being attacked
from all directions,

19
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:50,994
he couldn't see
what was in front of him.

20
00:02:58,112 --> 00:03:00,307
Mate. Mate!

21
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,794
(both laugh)

22
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:33,202
My name is David Fisk,

23
00:03:33,247 --> 00:03:35,408
Detective First Grade.

24
00:03:36,617 --> 00:03:39,484
I've been a cop in the NYPD
for over 30 years.

25
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:43,153
In that time...

26
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:47,226
I've killed 14 people.

27
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:51,120
Man: Run that by me
one more time.

28
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:54,692
I've killed 14 people.

29
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,396
He's nuts.

30
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:01,102
Turk's voice: When did
these things start?

31
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:07,373
How did they start?

32
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:15,751
Maybe this one started
with a guy named Charles Randall.

33
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:24,296
Randall was a child killer.

34
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:28,432
He killed his girlfriend's daughter

35
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:30,903
about four years ago.

36
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:34,264
Randall: Fuck you, damn asshole.

37
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:37,169
Turk's voice: He was tried
for the crime,

38
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:39,679
but was acquitted
by a jury of his peers.

39
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:57,322
My partner and I
found this unacceptable.

40
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:04,070
My partner is a good man.

41
00:05:25,092 --> 00:05:27,686
Are you really
gonna do this thing?

42
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:29,753
Do what?

43
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:32,230
You're going to
take down Randall

44
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:34,427
for a homicide
he didn't commit.

45
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:41,638
What am I gonna do?

46
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,666
You're my partner.

47
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,110
- You're my role model.
- Right.

48
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:48,137
What am I gonna do
without a role model?

49
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:54,350
We didn't have
this conversation.

50
00:05:54,388 --> 00:05:56,879
What conversation?

51
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:17,772
Turk's voice: It got done.

52
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:25,109
Randall lost his freedom

53
00:06:25,152 --> 00:06:27,120
for the crime he didn't commit.

54
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:35,052
Turk's voice: I lost my faith.

55
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:40,256
- I'm gonna go.
- Okay.

56
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:53,312
You can take this
as a confession if you want.

57
00:06:53,347 --> 00:06:55,338
Whatever.

58
00:06:55,382 --> 00:06:58,180
A few weeks ago
things heated up.

59
00:06:58,218 --> 00:06:59,981
What do we got on him, Turk?

60
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:04,423
Marcus Smith, AKA Spider...
big big dope deals,

61
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,892
murders, extortion,
lots of nice things.

62
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,259
He converted
this old abandoned bank

63
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:11,423
into Club 404 of Harlem.

64
00:07:11,465 --> 00:07:13,092
Maybe when he sees us
he'll confess.

65
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:15,101
What, you don't believe
in miracles?

66
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:16,727
When you pick up a check
one day...

67
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,102
one day,
then I'll believe in miracles.

68
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:22,267
- Let's go. I'm buying.
- Yeah, that's a miracle I want to see.

69
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:25,142
(crowd chattering,
distant music playing)

70
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:28,940
(hip-hop music playing)
#We fly high, no lie #

71
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:31,951
#You hear that?
You know this, balling #

72
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:34,954
#Foreign rides outside #

73
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:37,047
#It's like showbiz,
we in the building #

74
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,285
#We stay fly, no lie... #

75
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:41,089
Turk: This is where he launders
his money.

76
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:45,087
Rooster: Oh, yeah,
cleaning green green green.

77
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:47,327
Turk: He's all business.

78
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,566
I gotta take a leak.

79
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,474
Oh, I'll just be a sec.

80
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:03,983
I'm not peeking.

81
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:06,417
No problem.

82
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:13,482
- You guys are so lucky.
- Why is that?

83
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:15,825
No line to the bathroom and...

84
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:17,727
(sniffs)

85
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:19,994
You get to pee standing up.

86
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,864
Unzip, psss, zip.

87
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:24,166
Badda boom badda bing,
you're out of here.

88
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:28,607
Yeah, the big guy really outdid himself
on this thing.

89
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:30,007
You want a bump?

90
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:31,977
Where did you get that from?

91
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,446
Spider. Supremo.

92
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:41,086
(train whistle blows)

93
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:05,634
(door closes)

94
00:09:18,592 --> 00:09:20,583
(muffled screams)

95
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:23,118
(crash, thumping)

96
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:37,867
(sighs)

97
00:09:42,883 --> 00:09:44,874
Not bad.

98
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:48,183
Turk: Not bad?
What the fuck were you looking for?

99
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:50,621
Come on, Turk,

100
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:52,648
you pulled my hair.

101
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:55,889
Gee, my little sister used to
pull my hair harder than that.

102
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,123
Whatever.

103
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:03,394
I gotta go.

104
00:10:14,548 --> 00:10:16,846
- Where the fuck are you going?
- I'm tired.

105
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:19,545
You're tired?
It's America, you whiny bitch.

106
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:22,419
Why don't you fucking get in the cab
and do some honest work?

107
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,322
Yeah, she's on her way.
She can't wait to see you.

108
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:28,623
Rambo the Skateboard Pimp
was my 10th kill.

109
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:34,461
- (muffled gunshot)
- Think of me as a street-sweeper.

110
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:36,594
I cleaned up this worthless
piece of shit

111
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,662
and left an obituary of sorts.
It rhymes.

112
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:50,914
Rooster, we gotta find out
who did this.

113
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:52,816
Give him a medal.

114
00:10:52,853 --> 00:10:55,686
Hey, Rambo, you see
who did this?

115
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:57,690
He ain't talking, eh?

116
00:10:57,724 --> 00:10:59,919
Real name Robert Brady.

117
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,951
Bobby Brady. Damn shame.

118
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,826
What are you thinking?
Marcia? Greg?

119
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:05,297
(both chuckle)

120
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:07,323
You guys messing up
my crime scene again?

121
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:09,494
You don't know
who Bobby Brady is?

122
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:11,527
Yeah, we met about an hour ago.

123
00:11:11,571 --> 00:11:14,335
- It looks like close range.
- From the stippling around the wound

124
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:16,001
I'd say two to three feet away.

125
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:18,772
We'll be fishing fragments
out of his brains.

126
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:20,871
- What?
- No, I just got that...

127
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:23,007
"Marcia? Greg?"
That's a good one, Rooster.

128
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,778
Well, that was quick.

129
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:26,649
Just trying to keep pace with you.

130
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:33,952
Turk: "He trades in sin,
distributes flesh.

131
00:11:33,994 --> 00:11:36,360
He picks the fruit
when it is fresh.

132
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:39,524
Now someone else
must slap his whore.

133
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:44,299
His heart has stopped.
He breathes no more."

134
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:48,197
What do you want to do
about this?

135
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:51,039
I say let's make the best of it,

136
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:54,205
canvass the hookers.
Maybe we'll meet one you like.

137
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:57,876
Please. I got all I can handle
from you-know-who.

138
00:11:57,918 --> 00:11:59,715
No shit?

139
00:11:59,753 --> 00:12:02,847
She's got my sperm level so low
I gotta sit down to take a piss.

140
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,550
Oh, thanks for that picture.

141
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:06,855
- Hey, what can I tell you?
- (laughs)

142
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:09,657
(Russian accent)
How can I help you, gentlemen?

143
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:11,721
We'd like to talk to you
about your boss.

144
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:14,029
He's upstairs.

145
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,399
No, your other boss.

146
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:22,197
Rambo.

147
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,176
He is asshole.

148
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:27,373
Why "he is asshole"?

149
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,814
Follow me, please.

150
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,214
You know anybody
who'd want to kill him?

151
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:37,917
Me.

152
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,255
Anyone else?

153
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:41,283
Why? He's dead?

154
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:42,989
(chuckles)

155
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:45,554
Hey, listen, you want to smarten up
and help us out

156
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,293
or am I gonna have to call
somebody at ICE

157
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:49,097
and have you on the next plane
to kielbasa-land?

158
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:50,966
Go ahead.

159
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:52,904
I am American citizen.

160
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,998
Yeah.

161
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,100
Lick my balls anytime.

162
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:58,735
What?

163
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,769
Call us anytime, you know,

164
00:13:00,814 --> 00:13:03,214
if you hear something, anything.

165
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:08,418
Rooster: I think we're looking
for a guy named Sam the Butcher.

166
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:10,923
- Who?
- (laughs)

167
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:13,221
Nah, he's kidding around.
But seriously, Lieutenant,

168
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,284
how far do you want us to go
with this Rambo murder?

169
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:17,796
I don't know, I was thinking maybe
you could investigate it a bit more,

170
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:20,231
figure out who did it,
try to put him in jail.

171
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:23,133
That is, if it doesn't get in the way
of your shuffleboard lessons.

172
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:24,693
Yeah, no problem.

173
00:13:24,738 --> 00:13:27,605
We're also working this dealer Spider
who's tied to these two stiffs

174
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,937
we found on Fresh Kills.

175
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:35,146
If we can nail him, who knows
how far up the ladder it will lead?

176
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:36,307
So what about it?

177
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:38,044
I popped this lawyer
with an ounce of blow.

178
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:40,450
She practically shoved it up my nose.
I got her to flip on him.

179
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,148
Lucky fuck, eh?

180
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:43,815
She scored it from him directly?

181
00:13:43,857 --> 00:13:46,155
- Yeah, she did.
- Good.

182
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:49,889
Okay, well, get what you can out of her
and kick her loose.

183
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:52,365
I hate trying to prosecute
fucking lawyers.

184
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:55,198
(trains passing)

185
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:03,337
- This isn't Spider's club.
- The back way in.

186
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:07,403
Rooster: Yeah, it's an abandoned
linen factory, Jessica.

187
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:10,382
I guess I'm not your average...

188
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:11,907
what do you call it?

189
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:13,942
- Rat?
- Stoolie?

190
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:15,978
Thanks.

191
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:19,719
I mean, I think usually
it's some poor African-American kid

192
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:21,989
or a junkie or a prostitute.

193
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,588
Well, normally 200-grand-a-year
corporate lawyers

194
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:27,566
are much smarter than your average
African-American junkie whore...

195
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,228
normally, but sometimes
they only think they are.

196
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:33,137
Man over radio: It's all set
on this end.

197
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:34,834
Are you guys sure
it's safe in there?

198
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,934
Man: You tell your girlfriend
to grow a pair and let's go.

199
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:41,037
What do you say, Counsel?
Are you ready to do this thing?

200
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:43,743
Yeah, let's get it over with.

201
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:46,752
Okay, remember what we said?
You go in there,

202
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:50,187
you wait for him to ask you
for what you need, right?

203
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,851
And then you don't come back here
with less than four ounces.

204
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,359
- Four ounces?
- Yeah.

205
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:57,056
Isn't that a lot? I, like, buy a couple
of balls at the club, that's it.

206
00:14:57,097 --> 00:15:00,066
You just say you're going skiing and
you need a week's worth of fresh powder.

207
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,432
Yeah, you tell him you're going
on vacation.

208
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:09,069
I do this thing
and my record's wiped clean?

209
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:10,406
As a whistle.

210
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:12,411
No one at my law firm will know
that I got busted, right?

211
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:13,969
It never happened.

212
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,379
Look, Counsel, we all know you
better than this.

213
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:20,011
You just do this, you stop
shoving that shit up your nose,

214
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:21,816
you go home, you get married,
you have kids,

215
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,517
you never come back here,
and that's that.

216
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:28,357
Yeah.

217
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:31,227
Officer: Everybody's in position.

218
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:33,732
- Turk: Okay, we're going.
- Officer: Yes, sir.

219
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:38,697
Officer: Let's push the signal
back 50%.

220
00:15:39,706 --> 00:15:41,731
Rooster: Hey, Jessica.

221
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,241
Break a leg.

222
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,938
(radio chatter)

223
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:47,970
It's two flights down.

224
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:50,380
The door's on the left.
Ring the bell.

225
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:57,379
(rings doorbell)

226
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:59,891
Hey, Stubby, why don't you
go and escort our company up here?

227
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:03,719
Go on, fat boy.

228
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,124
Get it on.

229
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:19,439
- Good afternoon.
- Hey, Spider.

230
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,970
- I'll be downstairs.
- All right.

231
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,040
- How are you?
- All right, baby,

232
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,449
just checking out this wizard shit
before I let my kids watch it.

233
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,954
- You seen this?
- No.

234
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,456
The guy is a stone dealer.
I let my little ones watch this...

235
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,755
they'll all turn out junkies.
You know what I'm saying?

236
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:35,283
He's got a point.

237
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,523
- You remember Underdog?
- What about him?

238
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:40,499
That fucking dog spawned
a generation of junkies.

239
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:44,367
So you converted the bank
into a club and a recording studio?

240
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:46,964
- Yeah. You like it?
- Yeah.

241
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,906
What are you talking about?

242
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:50,671
What did Underdog do
all the time?

243
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,405
He was always shining shoes

244
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:54,606
and whenever Sweet Polly Purebred
would call out to him,

245
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:56,615
his dog ears would pick it up
and he'd rescue her.

246
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:59,117
Yeah, but what did he do
when he needed his super strength?

247
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:01,313
He'd go to his ring, remember?

248
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,219
Pull out a pill, pop it.

249
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:06,748
Holy shit, you're right.
He was a little fucking speed freak.

250
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:08,124
Spider: So what's the business?

251
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:10,994
How about a QP?
You're good for a QP.

252
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,691
The fuck you want with QP?

253
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:15,360
I'm going skiing with friends,

254
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,961
a lot of friends.

255
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:20,438
- Where?
- Aspen, Colorado.

256
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:23,203
Shit. I'm sure you can
score one in Aspen.

257
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:25,234
Not your primo brand.

258
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:27,679
You ski?

259
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:29,204
Sure. My whole life.

260
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:32,377
Come on, I don't have all day.

261
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:34,750
Why don't you put down your jacket,
stay a little while?

262
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:35,981
What do you think?

263
00:17:36,022 --> 00:17:37,580
Jessica: Actually,
I've got to run.

264
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:41,526
I have a major IPO
closing in an hour, so...

265
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:44,291
You know, stress will kill you.
You gotta chill out.

266
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:47,599
I'm as chill as I get.

267
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:49,625
What do you want to do?

268
00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:55,372
You know, every once in a while...

269
00:17:57,543 --> 00:17:59,602
one of you Upper East Side bitches
gets popped,

270
00:17:59,646 --> 00:18:01,637
tries to to roll over
on a nigga like me.

271
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:03,774
You're scared now.

272
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:06,979
(doorbell ringing)

273
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:11,047
Looks like the cavalry
come to rescue you.

274
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,580
Can I help you, gentlemen?

275
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,058
Yeah, let us in, Spider.

276
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,288
I'm sorry, there's no one here
by that name.

277
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:19,230
- Let us in.
- We only want to talk to you.

278
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,893
(door buzzes)

279
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,835
See, I know how to look
and I know where to look.

280
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,745
Come to papa.

281
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,108
It always hurts the first time.

282
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,747
Turk: You all right?

283
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:40,582
Why wouldn't she be all right?
We're watching TV.

284
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,281
How the fuck is she gonna get hurt
watching TV?

285
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:44,916
She could have seen or heard
something that scared her.

286
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,857
- Like what?
- Like some big fucking mutt

287
00:18:46,893 --> 00:18:48,417
shooting his bug fat
fucking mouth off.

288
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,328
Wasn't nobody here fitting that description
till a minute ago.

289
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:53,264
I'm gonna show you ugly,
you fucking mother...

290
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,767
- We've said enough.
- Oh, you wanna bring your wife up in here?

291
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:58,862
That's it. That's it.
Let's go. It's okay.

292
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:01,635
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.

293
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:03,642
You want your wire back?

294
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:07,109
Firearm!

295
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,238
No, Stubby, no!

296
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:18,854
Get down.
Get the fuck down!

297
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:30,101
Turk: Come on.

298
00:19:30,136 --> 00:19:32,934
The fat one's dead.

299
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,138
(Jessica moaning)

300
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:43,447
Well, that went well.

301
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:47,218
Oh, shit, you're bleeding.

302
00:19:48,221 --> 00:19:51,315
3-4 squad, Central.
11-41, request ambulance.

303
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:54,155
I need EMS. Subject shot,
184th and St. Nicholas.

304
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,388
Really, I tried my best.

305
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:59,728
You're doing just fine, Counsel.
You're doing just fine. Just relax.

306
00:19:59,766 --> 00:20:02,860
Hey, guys, if you ever
need a lawyer...

307
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:05,632
Yeah, okay.

308
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:08,139
You bet.

309
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:13,107
In good old days
we used to

310
00:20:13,146 --> 00:20:15,876
let the perp bleed out
and call off the ambulance.

311
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:17,849
- Calm calm calm.
- Fucking lowlife.

312
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:19,681
You made your point.
You made your point.

313
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,017
Tough little bitch, ain't you,
kicking a man while he's handcuffed?

314
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,545
Shut the fuck up,
you piece of shit.

315
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,217
You think I won't blow
your fucking head off?

316
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:28,022
I wouldn't think twice
about it.

317
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,324
I'd go in there,
get the fat boy's gun,

318
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:34,026
come back here
and put two between your eyes.

319
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,000
(rapid footsteps)

320
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:40,829
Where's EMS?

321
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:44,070
Woman: This thing was a clusterfuck
to end all clusterfucks.

322
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,668
You got nothing.

323
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:47,679
How about felony murder?

324
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:50,204
No drugs, right?
So no predicate felony,

325
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,149
no conspiracy,
no nothing.

326
00:20:52,185 --> 00:20:54,210
No felony. No felony.
I can't believe this.

327
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,982
No felony.
How do you spell felony?

328
00:20:56,022 --> 00:20:59,355
Homicide, racketeering, drugs...
I mean, what are we talking about?

329
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:02,020
Hey, you're lucky
that white girl didn't die.

330
00:21:02,061 --> 00:21:03,961
IAB is gonna interview
both of you

331
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:06,464
and do a preliminary report
over the next couple of weeks.

332
00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:09,991
Now off the record
you actually didn't violate procedure

333
00:21:10,036 --> 00:21:12,470
because the victim had a firearm
aimed at you,

334
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:14,735
so if you stick together
you should make it through this.

335
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:16,765
Lieutenant: You'd better get
your story straight too,

336
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:19,642
'cause I'm not going back to Far Rockaway
because you two fucked up.

337
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,273
And you're gonna spend some couch time
with the rubber-gun squad.

338
00:21:22,315 --> 00:21:26,115
And you'd better take this shrink seriously
or you'll be off active duty.

339
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:27,915
That fucking piece of shit
just walks.

340
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:29,751
Knock it off, Turk.

341
00:21:32,258 --> 00:21:34,886
Relax, partner.
He's gonna get his.

342
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:37,452
Man: Gentlemen, your questions.

343
00:21:37,497 --> 00:21:39,897
- Who made the decision to enter?
- I did.

344
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:41,923
- Whose decision was it to enter?
- Mine.

345
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:44,266
Did you immediately identify yourselves
as police officers?

346
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,601
- Yes, we did.
- Did you immediately identify yourselves?

347
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:49,130
The informant's position
was becoming untenable.

348
00:21:49,175 --> 00:21:51,439
- We were afraid she was in danger.
- Turns out you were right.

349
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,968
- No fucking kidding, nine-to-fiver.
- Excuse me, detective?

350
00:21:54,013 --> 00:21:56,413
Are you finished
with my client?

351
00:21:58,384 --> 00:22:02,343
- They're like Lennon and McCartney.
- Not an inch of daylight between them.

352
00:22:02,388 --> 00:22:03,616
What do you think?

353
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:04,953
Nothing there.

354
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:07,858
They endangered the informant.
We can't make them wrong on that.

355
00:22:07,894 --> 00:22:09,521
They saw a gun, they reacted.

356
00:22:09,562 --> 00:22:11,325
They beat the fuck
out of the suspect,

357
00:22:11,364 --> 00:22:13,457
but he's not filing charges.

358
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,558
Let's see what the shrink says.

359
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:18,969
So what are we gonna
do now, doc?

360
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:21,200
Are we gonna find out
if I'm sane enough

361
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,970
to carry a gun,
chase bad guys?

362
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,604
Okay, why did you become a cop?

363
00:22:26,646 --> 00:22:29,376
Well, it was New Year's Eve.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

364
00:22:29,415 --> 00:22:33,317
I didn't have the same opportunities
you had, Dr. Prosky.

365
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,048
Where I come from
it was either a gun and a badge

366
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:37,953
or a hard hat and a hammer.

367
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:40,458
How do you feel
when you fire your weapon?

368
00:22:40,493 --> 00:22:43,223
It's like dirty Harry said...
"There's nothing wrong

369
00:22:43,262 --> 00:22:45,890
with a little shooting as long as
the right people get shot."

370
00:22:45,932 --> 00:22:47,866
Prosky: And when the wrong people
get shot?

371
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,869
Turk: It sucks, but I'd rather be in it
that out of it.

372
00:22:50,903 --> 00:22:52,996
There's nothing worse
than being stuck on a bench.

373
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,269
How do you feel when you see
innocent people get killed?

374
00:22:55,308 --> 00:22:57,538
You know...

375
00:22:59,312 --> 00:23:02,509
I sort of get numb to it.

376
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:05,210
Here.

377
00:23:05,251 --> 00:23:06,741
I want you to take this.

378
00:23:06,786 --> 00:23:10,153
Use it to jot down your thoughts,
your questions,

379
00:23:10,189 --> 00:23:12,680
anything you may have noticed
about yourself,

380
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:14,192
whatever.

381
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,057
I won't ask for it.

382
00:23:16,095 --> 00:23:18,859
Just for you.

383
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:20,388
I want you to try it.

384
00:23:20,433 --> 00:23:22,458
Sounds like fun.

385
00:23:24,337 --> 00:23:27,898
(Karen panting)
Harder.

386
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:37,045
(crowd cheering)

387
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:43,919
Go, Turk, go!

388
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:48,351
You got third.
Go go!

389
00:23:48,394 --> 00:23:51,090
Yeah!
Look at that.

390
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:53,496
You own it. You own it.

391
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:55,397
No matter what they say
about you,

392
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,527
you're tremendous!

393
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:01,937
Go go, Turk, go!

394
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,869
Safe.
You dropped the ball.

395
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:08,243
- A fucking cheap shot, man.
- Get away from the bag.

396
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,215
- Or what? Or what? Or what?
- Watch the bag.

397
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:14,913
(all yelling)

398
00:24:22,862 --> 00:24:25,296
Turk's voice: The NYPD is bubbling
with frustration,

399
00:24:25,331 --> 00:24:26,923
hostility and testosterone,

400
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:28,957
ready to erupt
at any moment.

401
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:31,026
Think of me
as the release valve.

402
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,903
One flick of the trigger
and the pressure goes down.

403
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:36,032
You know why
you join the force?

404
00:24:36,075 --> 00:24:38,168
To get respect.

405
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,939
Most people respect the badge.

406
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:42,311
Everybody respects the gun.

407
00:24:47,753 --> 00:24:49,744
Hey, Riley, I was talking to Jo...

408
00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:52,849
you guys caught a stiff named
Phillip Trager, a gun-runner?

409
00:24:52,892 --> 00:24:55,122
Oh, yeah, a real piece of shit.

410
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:57,095
- How did that go down?
- I don't know.

411
00:24:57,129 --> 00:24:59,393
Somebody gave him a taste
of his own medicine, I guess,

412
00:24:59,432 --> 00:25:01,832
walked right into his apartment,
killed him with one of his own guns.

413
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:04,131
Did the shooter leave a note
or anything?

414
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:07,139
Yeah, actually,
the shooter left a poem.

415
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:12,767
He did?
No shit.

416
00:25:12,812 --> 00:25:14,803
Yeah. Hey, Simon,

417
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:18,283
you remember that poem
from the Trager case?

418
00:25:20,286 --> 00:25:22,345
What are you doing, man?

419
00:25:22,388 --> 00:25:24,379
Turk's asking about it.

420
00:25:24,423 --> 00:25:26,891
What the hell are you doing?

421
00:25:26,926 --> 00:25:29,360
? Que mierda 'tas haciendo ahi, papa?

422
00:25:29,395 --> 00:25:31,329
No le digas mierda a eso loco.

423
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:34,992
Riley: Calmate. He wants to hear
about the poem.

424
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:37,264
"Merchant of thieving class,

425
00:25:37,303 --> 00:25:40,431
I slit his throat
and capped his ass.

426
00:25:40,473 --> 00:25:41,940
I took his gun, I took his...

427
00:25:41,974 --> 00:25:44,966
I took his life, I took his gun,
But too bad he's not the only one."

428
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,069
That's how it goes,
something like that.

429
00:25:47,113 --> 00:25:49,411
It's not iambic pentameter,
but it rhymes.

430
00:25:49,448 --> 00:25:51,439
- Rooster.
- Yo.

431
00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:54,351
We're looking for the same guy.

432
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:57,549
He knocked off a pimp named Rambo
a few weeks ago. When was yours?

433
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:00,115
Last week. We're running ours with the ATF
because of the guns.

434
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,219
We're back in business on the Rambo case.
Looks like the same guy knocked off

435
00:26:03,262 --> 00:26:05,696
- a gun dealer on the three-three last week.
- No shit.

436
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:08,700
- What do you mean? That's our case.
- That's our case. You're taking our case.

437
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:11,202
Seniority, guys.
Tag along, you'll learn something.

438
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:13,398
Oh, tell me the guy's name
is Greg Brady.

439
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:15,407
Please. It is, isn't it?

440
00:26:15,441 --> 00:26:18,001
Oh, somebody's knocking off
the Brady Bunch.

441
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:21,911
Gotta be the Partridge Family.
(laughs)

442
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:25,007
Turk's voice: Trager,
a gun-runner bites the dust...

443
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:27,109
number 11.

444
00:26:35,494 --> 00:26:39,294
Karen: The bullet matched the.45
in Trager's apartment.

445
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:41,799
That was no surprise.
So I ran it through ATF.

446
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:44,860
It's one of a batch of six
that was stolen from a gun shop

447
00:26:44,904 --> 00:26:47,202
- in Virginia last month.
- Yeah, probably by Trager.

448
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:49,935
That's what they think.
He matches the description they have.

449
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:52,671
It still doesn't help us find the guy.
It just helps us tie him to the victims,

450
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:55,202
which he's already doing
with his little fucking poems.

451
00:26:55,247 --> 00:26:58,307
- (phone ringing)
- Excuse me. Hello.

452
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:01,581
Hey, Turk, don't forget
we got a court date later.

453
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,783
So...

454
00:27:04,824 --> 00:27:08,453
I heard he kicked the shit
out of that dealer you guys took down.

455
00:27:08,494 --> 00:27:10,325
Spider.

456
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:11,522
So?

457
00:27:13,199 --> 00:27:15,690
Did he?

458
00:27:18,537 --> 00:27:21,165
Yeah, he got him
down on the ground.

459
00:27:21,207 --> 00:27:23,607
The guy was handcuffed.

460
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:27,704
And he just started
kicking him in the gut.

461
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:30,146
And then

462
00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:32,514
he gets down on the guy's chest

463
00:27:32,551 --> 00:27:35,884
and he really starts smacking him

464
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:38,856
hard in the face over and over

465
00:27:38,891 --> 00:27:40,882
and screaming at the top
of his lungs,

466
00:27:40,926 --> 00:27:43,190
"I'm gonna break
your fucking face,

467
00:27:43,229 --> 00:27:45,629
you little bitch!"

468
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:47,996
Then his eyes really started
to fill up.

469
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:50,024
I mean, they get dark...

470
00:27:50,069 --> 00:27:52,230
you know how he gets
the sort of rage in him.

471
00:27:53,372 --> 00:27:56,034
I thought he was gonna
kill this guy.

472
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:59,877
Really?

473
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:04,981
You're a bad little girl.

474
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:06,882
Hmm?

475
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:09,979
- I got work to do.
- You bet.

476
00:28:11,957 --> 00:28:15,358
Woman: Counselor,
my hands are tied here.

477
00:28:15,394 --> 00:28:17,385
Without a secure
chain of custody,

478
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:20,159
any evidence obtained
after the initial search

479
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:22,667
- must be excluded.
- You gotta be fucking kidding me.

480
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:25,067
Therefore I am forced
to grant defense

481
00:28:25,104 --> 00:28:27,402
motion to dismiss
all charges

482
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:29,634
of rape and assault
against Mr. Van Luytens.

483
00:28:29,675 --> 00:28:31,666
- Your Honor.
- Judge: You think I want this guy

484
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,871
going anywhere
near my daughter,

485
00:28:33,913 --> 00:28:36,074
or anyone's daughter
for that matter?

486
00:28:36,115 --> 00:28:38,583
You messed up.
I am unleashing your client

487
00:28:38,617 --> 00:28:40,881
unto the world.
I'm sure we'll all be

488
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,353
back here again very soon.

489
00:28:42,388 --> 00:28:45,380
Look at him.
Look at this motherfucker.

490
00:28:45,424 --> 00:28:49,019
Hey, it's gonna come back to you, mutt.
You're gonna get it.

491
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:51,495
- When you walk outside watch your back.
- Easy, Turk.

492
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:52,690
Order in my court.

493
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:55,996
- Okay, mutt? You fucking mutt.
- Not here, not now.

494
00:28:56,035 --> 00:28:58,469
Not here, not now.
Will you get him out of here

495
00:28:58,504 --> 00:29:01,064
before somebody passes a sentence
on him you can't appeal?

496
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:02,334
Order!

497
00:29:02,374 --> 00:29:05,502
- You know what I mean? Go go.
- Order, detective.

498
00:29:05,544 --> 00:29:09,503
Turk's voice: Dr. Prosky suggested
that I free-associate.

499
00:29:09,548 --> 00:29:11,948
So here I go.

500
00:29:11,984 --> 00:29:14,612
You know what I think about
when I pull a trigger?

501
00:29:14,653 --> 00:29:17,588
- I think about the Infield Fly Rule.
- (doorbell buzzes)

502
00:29:17,623 --> 00:29:20,649
I love that fucking rule.
It assumes the worst in everybody.

503
00:29:20,693 --> 00:29:24,390
It says, "Sorry, batter, you're a schmuck
for popping up with runners on.

504
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,830
And you, stupid-ass infielder,
you don't get to cheat

505
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:29,299
and drop the ball just because
you caught a break."

506
00:29:29,335 --> 00:29:30,996
My favorite part...
the batter's out

507
00:29:31,036 --> 00:29:33,197
but the runners advance
at their own risk.

508
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:35,502
Well, isn't this
a pleasant surprise?

509
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:37,634
Turk's voice: That's the way
life should be.

510
00:29:37,676 --> 00:29:39,667
You can be a motherfucker
at your own risk.

511
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:42,943
(muffled gunshots)

512
00:29:42,982 --> 00:29:46,816
Or not.
Van Luytens... one less rapist.

513
00:29:46,852 --> 00:29:49,082
Who's gonna miss him?
Nobody.

514
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:51,282
Number 12 and counting.

515
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:07,437
Whoa whoa, hot coffee.

516
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:09,168
- Good morning, Detective Riley.
- Hey, good morning.

517
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:11,176
- Door on your left.
- Any signs of forced entry?

518
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:12,905
Doesn't look like it.
Detective Perez is in there.

519
00:30:12,945 --> 00:30:14,344
He's in there already?
All right.

520
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,507
- Hey, how about those Mets last night?
- Yeah, how about 'em?

521
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:18,607
Hey, Teddy, Teddy, come here,
check this out.

522
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:22,385
Wow.

523
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:23,649
Fuck.

524
00:30:23,689 --> 00:30:26,487
- Oh my God.
- That's big.

525
00:30:26,525 --> 00:30:28,516
And powerful.

526
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,427
- What, a plasma screen?
- LCD.

527
00:30:31,463 --> 00:30:33,522
- That's plasma.
- No, it's got to be LCD.

528
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:35,863
- Perez: It wouldn't be that big.
- Hey, guys, guys.

529
00:30:35,901 --> 00:30:39,337
He was shot at close range,
dropped right here.

530
00:30:39,371 --> 00:30:42,135
The pussy doesn't look like he put up
much of a fight, does he, Karen?

531
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:44,233
Nothing to indicate that

532
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:47,803
in terms of struggle.
No forced entry, cuts, bruises.

533
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:51,077
Hey, nobody wants to hear
about your private life, Officer Corelli.

534
00:30:51,116 --> 00:30:54,347
That's detective to you,
Officer Needledick.

535
00:30:54,386 --> 00:30:56,320
- Ooh.
- Perez: Ouch.

536
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:58,687
- Looks like it's our guy again.
- Who did you get this time?

537
00:30:58,724 --> 00:31:00,385
This is Jonathan Van Luytens.

538
00:31:00,426 --> 00:31:02,360
He owns a couple
of car dealerships.

539
00:31:02,394 --> 00:31:04,726
- Oh, shit.
- He was up on rape charges,

540
00:31:04,763 --> 00:31:06,958
but they got tossed out
last week.

541
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:08,990
Look at this.

542
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:13,130
"A man devoid of all respect,
Of beauty, charm or intellect,

543
00:31:13,172 --> 00:31:15,606
He took what women
would not give.

544
00:31:15,641 --> 00:31:17,575
He didn't have
the right to live."

545
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:19,975
That's our boy all right.

546
00:31:20,012 --> 00:31:23,175
Looks like he had a beef
with our old pal Johnny.

547
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:24,307
You know him?

548
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:26,214
Both: Yeah.

549
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:28,549
He's one slippery
son of a bitch, let me tell you.

550
00:31:28,587 --> 00:31:31,290
Turk: Yeah.

551
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:34,418
Lieutenant: You guys know how much
fun it is to not catch a serial killer?

552
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,189
You got a point here, Lieutenant?

553
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:37,991
The point is

554
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:40,157
you'd better both
think seriously

555
00:31:40,199 --> 00:31:42,292
about whether or not
you want the lead on this case.

556
00:31:42,334 --> 00:31:43,995
You don't think
we're up to this?

557
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:48,200
Come on, you got what,

558
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,936
about 110 years on the job
between the two of you?

559
00:31:50,976 --> 00:31:54,036
- 120.
- (laughs)

560
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:56,343
I'm telling you, you screw it up
badly enough,

561
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:58,576
they may try to fuck you
out of your pension.

562
00:31:58,617 --> 00:31:59,845
You want to risk that?

563
00:31:59,885 --> 00:32:01,716
- Yeah.
- Fuck, yeah.

564
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:06,713
406, Lieutenant. 406.

565
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,352
Okay, 406...
what does that mean?

566
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:10,918
Ted Williams.

567
00:32:10,963 --> 00:32:14,023
Ted Williams, the last day of the season,
is batting 400.

568
00:32:14,066 --> 00:32:17,160
Sox manager wants to bench him,
protect his average, right?

569
00:32:17,202 --> 00:32:18,999
Williams plays
both games anyway,

570
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:21,005
goes six for eight,
ends up at 406...

571
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,734
the last guy that ever hit
over 400.

572
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:25,265
Okay, fine. It's all yours.

573
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:28,336
Just don't go moaning to me
when some traffic cop

574
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,678
pulls your serial killer over
for speeding

575
00:32:30,716 --> 00:32:33,344
and he grabs your
15 minutes of fame and you realize

576
00:32:33,385 --> 00:32:36,548
the asshole could have been
standing right there in front of you

577
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:39,648
and it would have taken you
1000 light years to nail him.

578
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:41,420
Not for nothing, Lieutenant,

579
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,520
light years measures distance,
not time.

580
00:32:46,932 --> 00:32:49,400
Well, thank you, detective.
I'll make a note of that.

581
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:52,267
Ellis Lynde, 2003.

582
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:55,068
This guy had a history
of cruising gay bars,

583
00:32:55,107 --> 00:32:57,905
picking up twinkies,
beating the shit out of them.

584
00:32:57,943 --> 00:33:00,844
Lynde was found shot dead
in his apartment.

585
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:03,780
Whoever's doing this
gets up real close to the guys,

586
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,477
blows their brains out
without any trouble,

587
00:33:06,518 --> 00:33:08,008
leaves no fingerprints

588
00:33:08,053 --> 00:33:09,850
and obviously
takes pride in his work.

589
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:14,188
Okay, what could be
murder number two back from '04,

590
00:33:14,226 --> 00:33:15,659
one Matthew Mitrella.

591
00:33:15,694 --> 00:33:17,628
(trails off)

592
00:33:20,632 --> 00:33:22,759
Turk's voice: I was shaking
the first couple of times

593
00:33:22,801 --> 00:33:25,634
I killed in cold blood.

594
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:29,004
I kept thinking if I got caught
they'd kick me off the force.

595
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:31,669
I wasn't worried about prison,
but losing the gun and the shield...

596
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:32,938
that scared me.

597
00:33:32,978 --> 00:33:35,469
I went into work the next day
expecting to feel different.

598
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:38,608
I thought everybody would look at me
the way cops look at civilians

599
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:40,880
and know which ones are dirty.

600
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:50,191
But they didn't.
That's when I knew

601
00:33:50,229 --> 00:33:52,823
I could keep on
doing this forever.

602
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:59,904
Turk's voice: So next stop... Spider.

603
00:33:59,938 --> 00:34:01,929
If we shut down his business,

604
00:34:01,974 --> 00:34:03,965
maybe he'd be a rat.

605
00:34:04,009 --> 00:34:06,000
We got a lawyer.

606
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:09,810
We needed her to testify
that she bought coke from him.

607
00:34:09,848 --> 00:34:12,408
She was a good lawyer.

608
00:34:12,451 --> 00:34:16,911
Me and my partner paid a visit
to Club 404 of Harlem.

609
00:34:16,955 --> 00:34:18,081
A word about him...

610
00:34:18,123 --> 00:34:21,217
Tom Cowen's been my partner
for almost 30 years.

611
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,194
He's the best cop
I've ever seen.

612
00:34:25,097 --> 00:34:28,624
I'm always the one
following him through the door.

613
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:30,828
There's a bullet
that was meant for me

614
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:34,430
that's lodged in his torso.

615
00:34:34,473 --> 00:34:36,532
He was my role model.

616
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:38,941
The day I stopped
trying to be Tom Cowen

617
00:34:38,977 --> 00:34:41,445
was the greatest day
of my life.

618
00:34:55,294 --> 00:34:58,286
Hey, Rooster,

619
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:01,356
I was going through the files
on poetry boy.

620
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,630
That's an interesting way
to pass your time.

621
00:35:03,669 --> 00:35:06,103
Okay, there was a gun

622
00:35:06,138 --> 00:35:08,299
found on Charles Randall
when he was arrested.

623
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,568
Yeah.

624
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:12,771
Now in all the other shootings
the gun was left at the scene,

625
00:35:12,811 --> 00:35:15,974
but there are a lot of similarities.
So I mentioned it to Perez and Riley.

626
00:35:16,014 --> 00:35:18,073
I think somebody should go
interview him in prison.

627
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,744
I think there may be a connection.

628
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:24,244
That's a good idea,
but not Perez and Riley.

629
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:26,723
I mean, not those guys.
They'll screw it up.

630
00:35:26,758 --> 00:35:28,885
This is too important.

631
00:35:28,927 --> 00:35:31,395
Turk and I will handle Randall, okay?

632
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:32,988
Good work.

633
00:35:56,455 --> 00:35:58,480
(door buzzes)

634
00:36:04,429 --> 00:36:06,795
Detectives, Charles Randall.

635
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:11,761
What the fuck
do you two scumbags want?

636
00:36:11,803 --> 00:36:14,499
What a greeting.

637
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:17,599
You like poetry, Chuck?

638
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:18,700
What?

639
00:36:18,744 --> 00:36:21,941
Do you like poetry?

640
00:36:22,981 --> 00:36:26,678
Yeah.
Roses are red, violets are blue,

641
00:36:26,718 --> 00:36:29,653
I want to poke out your fucking eyes
with my dick, you fuck.

642
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:31,679
How's that?

643
00:36:31,723 --> 00:36:34,351
I thought you'd rhyme.
You didn't.

644
00:36:34,393 --> 00:36:36,554
Fuck you.
Fuck both of you.

645
00:36:36,595 --> 00:36:38,222
Get me out of here.

646
00:36:38,263 --> 00:36:41,164
(door buzzes)

647
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:44,691
(siren wailing)

648
00:36:44,736 --> 00:36:48,172
(blues playing)

649
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,504
Why the fuck did we even bother
going out there?

650
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:52,635
What would it look like
if we didn't go?

651
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:56,574
Are you gonna relax?

652
00:36:56,615 --> 00:36:58,606
Relax.

653
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:00,550
Yeah, I'll just take it out
on Karen later.

654
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:02,883
The more I'm with her,
the more abuse she wants.

655
00:37:02,921 --> 00:37:04,183
Sounds like fun.

656
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,814
Hey, you want to take her
off my hands?

657
00:37:05,857 --> 00:37:10,317
Be careful, partner, because I have
a very special effect on women.

658
00:37:10,362 --> 00:37:11,556
Go wild.

659
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:12,995
Whatever.

660
00:37:13,031 --> 00:37:16,023
I can't believe I had to face
that piece of shit and look like an idiot.

661
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:19,366
Eh, fuck him.
He's where he belongs.

662
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:21,031
I'm sorry, partner,
I'm really sorry.

663
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:24,007
Stop worrying about it.

664
00:37:25,844 --> 00:37:29,541
Whatever happens,
I'm not taking you down with me.

665
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:32,550
Don't worry about me.
I'm all right, believe me.

666
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:35,849
I don't know what I was thinking.
I just don't know what I was thinking.

667
00:37:35,887 --> 00:37:38,219
You know what you was thinking?
You were thinking

668
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,918
about a 10-year-old girl
who had her skull crushed.

669
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:44,395
Yeah, I tried to stop you,
but you know what?

670
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:48,695
I admired you that day,
what you did.

671
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:51,702
That was righteous.

672
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:55,570
And you don't second-guess yourself
on something like that.

673
00:38:02,581 --> 00:38:04,572
Okay, I'm the killer.

674
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:07,141
I'm the killer.
I show up at your door

675
00:38:07,185 --> 00:38:09,176
or your car window,

676
00:38:09,221 --> 00:38:11,519
and for some reason
you open your door,

677
00:38:11,556 --> 00:38:14,491
you roll down
your car window for me.

678
00:38:14,526 --> 00:38:16,721
So who am I?

679
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:19,127
Someone I know.

680
00:38:19,164 --> 00:38:20,654
Maybe a nice set of tits.

681
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:22,792
And the poems?
What about the poems?

682
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:25,200
You have to compose the poem
before you got there, right?

683
00:38:25,237 --> 00:38:27,228
Otherwise what, you're gonna
blow out the guy's brains,

684
00:38:27,272 --> 00:38:29,137
sit down and write a little sonnet
for yourself?

685
00:38:29,174 --> 00:38:30,573
No prints on the poems,

686
00:38:30,609 --> 00:38:33,601
so probably
I wore gloves when I wrote it.

687
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:36,705
You obviously know your victims.
Between that and the easy access,

688
00:38:36,748 --> 00:38:39,080
I guess that they know you too.
They must.

689
00:38:39,117 --> 00:38:41,551
These guys are all scumbags.
They're not gonna trust anyone,

690
00:38:41,586 --> 00:38:44,146
open the door for anyone,
especially if they don't know them.

691
00:38:44,189 --> 00:38:46,521
Yeah, but I more than know them.

692
00:38:46,558 --> 00:38:48,890
I know everything about them.
I know their moves,

693
00:38:48,927 --> 00:38:50,792
their patterns,
I know their schedules.

694
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:53,627
Okay, so you're following them.
You're staking them out.

695
00:39:06,878 --> 00:39:09,472
Anyone gonna say it?

696
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:11,448
What?

697
00:39:13,952 --> 00:39:16,614
Fuck me.

698
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:20,155
- He's right, it's a cop.
- No.

699
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:22,489
Let's slow down, fellows.
We're getting way ahead of ourselves.

700
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:26,122
- Come on, it's a cop, you know it.
- I don't know shit. Neither do you.

701
00:39:26,164 --> 00:39:29,031
I'm telling your right now,
it's a cop, it's a cop, it's a cop.

702
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:30,762
What do you mean,
"It's a cop, it's a cop, it's a cop"?

703
00:39:30,802 --> 00:39:34,067
- Where do you come off saying it's a cop?
- Easy, partner, he's just saying it.

704
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:36,733
- What are you talking about?
- He's just saying...

705
00:39:36,775 --> 00:39:40,074
I know, I know, I know
what he's saying.

706
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:43,509
And I'm saying it's bullshit.

707
00:39:44,516 --> 00:39:47,485
Shoot me. What the fuck?
But don't say it's a cop.

708
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:54,821
#You cast a spell on me #

709
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:57,419
#I was blind and now I see #

710
00:39:57,462 --> 00:40:00,454
#You work your magic,
that's the key #

711
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:03,058
#You wave your wand #

712
00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:06,662
#And cast a spell on me... #

713
00:40:06,705 --> 00:40:08,696
Turk: So what about dinner?

714
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,332
You feel like going out?

715
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:12,172
Where?

716
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:14,075
I don't care.
You're the one going.

717
00:40:14,112 --> 00:40:15,943
What is your problem?

718
00:40:15,981 --> 00:40:17,972
No problem.

719
00:40:18,016 --> 00:40:20,143
If you feel like hanging around,
be my guest.

720
00:40:20,185 --> 00:40:21,516
I don't feel like going out.

721
00:40:21,553 --> 00:40:24,716
Fine, just don't bug me.

722
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:28,886
This is the best part of my day
and I don't need you fucking it up.

723
00:40:30,695 --> 00:40:33,687
So you only fuck cops?

724
00:40:33,732 --> 00:40:36,599
Once in a while
I do a fireman or an ex-con.

725
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:40,197
You lump us in together?

726
00:40:40,238 --> 00:40:42,365
Well, I have some respect
for firemen.

727
00:40:42,407 --> 00:40:44,204
Fuck you.

728
00:40:44,242 --> 00:40:46,176
You know why they take away
your nightstick

729
00:40:46,211 --> 00:40:48,441
- when you hang up your uniform?
- No.

730
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,675
They don't trust you with it.

731
00:40:50,715 --> 00:40:52,876
Right now I wouldn't trust
myself with it either.

732
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:54,942
Shit, you'd probably love that.

733
00:40:54,986 --> 00:40:56,647
Too bad you never met
Van Luytens.

734
00:40:56,688 --> 00:40:58,383
You two really would have
hit it off great.

735
00:40:58,423 --> 00:41:00,584
At least somebody finally
brought some justice down

736
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,456
on that dickless little fuck.

737
00:41:02,494 --> 00:41:04,792
Now that is who I'd like to meet.

738
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:06,729
Well, maybe you'll get
your wish one day.

739
00:41:06,765 --> 00:41:08,596
They think it's a cop.

740
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:10,260
- Makes sense.
- Bullshit.

741
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,292
It's just some fucking psychopath.

742
00:41:12,337 --> 00:41:14,669
Well, there's plenty of those
on the job.

743
00:41:23,114 --> 00:41:24,672
- Are you sleeping well?
- Not really.

744
00:41:24,716 --> 00:41:26,240
- Yep.
- Eating well?

745
00:41:26,284 --> 00:41:27,751
- No.
- Yeah.

746
00:41:27,786 --> 00:41:28,980
Any recurring nightmares?

747
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:31,511
Yeah, that I'm stuck
in a room with you forever.

748
00:41:32,724 --> 00:41:34,089
Nope.

749
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:35,922
Do you think you're fit
to return to duty?

750
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,951
- Abso-fucking-lutely.
- Yeah.

751
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:41,124
- You ever think about retiring?
- You mean, death with benefits?

752
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:42,963
What's not to like?

753
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:44,969
- You ever think about retiring?
- Not really.

754
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:46,994
What have I got to look forward to?

755
00:41:47,038 --> 00:41:49,233
Sailing my 26-footer
around Sheepshead Bay,

756
00:41:49,274 --> 00:41:50,707
umpiring cops' softball?

757
00:41:50,742 --> 00:41:52,835
- How about corporate security work?
- It's too dangerous.

758
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:56,142
- So what are you gonna do?
- Maybe I'll buy a boat.

759
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:58,273
Turk: All right, look,
I don't know if I believe this,

760
00:41:58,316 --> 00:42:00,079
but I'm just gonna
throw it out there.

761
00:42:00,118 --> 00:42:02,450
You guys say we're looking
for one of our own,

762
00:42:02,487 --> 00:42:06,446
but what if it was an ex-cop,
somebody with an ax to grind?

763
00:42:06,491 --> 00:42:08,152
You got one in mind?

764
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:11,321
He's thinking about Martin Baum

765
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:14,126
our old lieutenant.

766
00:42:14,165 --> 00:42:16,531
So what's the story with him?

767
00:42:16,568 --> 00:42:18,559
He got fired a few years ago.

768
00:42:18,603 --> 00:42:21,800
I'm not saying there's any motive,
but he knew all the victims.

769
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:25,401
Yeah, but Turk,
I knew most of those guys.

770
00:42:25,443 --> 00:42:28,606
So did you, Riley, Perez.
Even Karen knew 'em.

771
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:30,705
- I'm just throwing it out there.
- Well, maybe you killed 'em.

772
00:42:30,749 --> 00:42:34,048
Yeah, maybe I did.

773
00:42:34,085 --> 00:42:36,246
The poems and the placement
of the weapons

774
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:38,084
are all we've got
linking the kills,

775
00:42:38,123 --> 00:42:40,819
which means what we gotta do now
is get humping on the forensics.

776
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:43,225
That shouldn't be
too much of a problem.

777
00:42:43,261 --> 00:42:45,252
We already got the girl
working on that.

778
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:49,062
That's right, Karen's been
humping on it all week, as we speak.

779
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,568
What did you say?

780
00:42:51,603 --> 00:42:52,865
Here we go again.

781
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:54,667
- You should watch your mouth.
- Oh, yeah?

782
00:42:54,706 --> 00:42:57,174
He didn't mean anything by it.
Karen and him are ancient history.

783
00:42:57,208 --> 00:42:59,369
- College boy can't speak for himself?
- Yeah, I can speak for myself.

784
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:01,207
Let me speak for myself...
fuck you, Turk.

785
00:43:01,246 --> 00:43:03,214
Mutt, I'm gonna hit you
on the head with this barbell.

786
00:43:03,248 --> 00:43:05,341
I'm not better than you.
You're not better than me, man.

787
00:43:05,383 --> 00:43:07,078
You put your balls
in your pocket.

788
00:43:07,118 --> 00:43:08,779
And you, fellow officers,

789
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:13,018
a little courtesy
for a fellow professional, you know?

790
00:43:13,057 --> 00:43:16,083
Please. Are we gonna move on
here now?

791
00:43:16,127 --> 00:43:18,118
What are we doing?
Where were we?

792
00:43:18,163 --> 00:43:21,724
Talking about Martin Baum.
What's his story?

793
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:24,257
Some guys under him
got caught taking money.

794
00:43:24,302 --> 00:43:26,566
Baum stood up for them,
tried to cover it up.

795
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,004
He do time?

796
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,873
Well, they pressed charges,
but he plead out and resigned.

797
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:33,901
So what's his beef with you?

798
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:35,776
I could have lied to protect him,
but I didn't.

799
00:43:35,814 --> 00:43:38,806
Okay, but if he's got a beef with you,
why not go after you?

800
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:41,341
Why not kill you? Why go around
acting like a serial killer,

801
00:43:41,386 --> 00:43:43,251
killing all these degenerates?
It doesn't make any sense.

802
00:43:43,288 --> 00:43:45,722
- I'm just telling you.
- I'm telling you it doesn't make sense.

803
00:43:45,757 --> 00:43:47,816
I'm throwing it out there.
I'm saying this is what it is.

804
00:43:47,859 --> 00:43:49,952
You want to check him out or not?
I don't give a shit.

805
00:43:49,994 --> 00:43:52,519
- It doesn't make any sense.
- You're the ones that think it's a cop.

806
00:43:52,564 --> 00:43:54,498
I'm just saying here's a cop
with a chip on his shoulder.

807
00:43:54,532 --> 00:43:56,523
Check him out if you want.
I don't give a shit.

808
00:43:56,568 --> 00:43:59,901
Calm down and give a better reason
why Baum could be a suspect, okay?

809
00:43:59,938 --> 00:44:01,701
(door slams)

810
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:04,173
PMS, gotta be.

811
00:44:10,949 --> 00:44:13,850
- Hey, guys.
- What's going on?

812
00:44:13,885 --> 00:44:16,285
I came over to bring you
the FBI report

813
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:18,289
on the paper
and handwriting.

814
00:44:18,323 --> 00:44:20,450
You don't have a problem
with me looking over the evidence

815
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:22,925
that I collected and processed
for you, do you?

816
00:44:22,961 --> 00:44:24,861
- No problem.
- Put it back, Karen.

817
00:44:24,896 --> 00:44:26,887
- This is fascinating.
- Let's go, come on.

818
00:44:26,931 --> 00:44:28,899
Come on, let's go, let's go.

819
00:44:28,933 --> 00:44:30,730
- What?
- Come on, let's go.

820
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:32,793
Get your hands off me.

821
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:35,067
I'll give you a little privacy.
I don't want to interrupt anything here.

822
00:44:35,106 --> 00:44:36,903
Are you afraid of me
looking at your old case files?

823
00:44:36,941 --> 00:44:39,409
- Is that it?
- Okay, I'm gone. Enjoy.

824
00:44:39,444 --> 00:44:41,435
- What?
- What is it with you?

825
00:44:41,479 --> 00:44:43,504
- What is it with you?
- (door slams)

826
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:50,309
I'm sorry about last night, okay?

827
00:44:50,355 --> 00:44:53,017
I really am. It's a habit.

828
00:44:53,057 --> 00:44:55,958
Habits can be broken, right?

829
00:44:55,994 --> 00:44:57,393
That's bullshit.

830
00:44:57,428 --> 00:44:58,690
No.

831
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:01,198
I'm totally serious, all right?

832
00:45:02,667 --> 00:45:04,965
It's not bullshit,

833
00:45:05,003 --> 00:45:06,994
really.

834
00:45:13,678 --> 00:45:16,146
Perez: Why do you think
Turk was so quick to take the lead

835
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:19,081
on the poetry case, huh?
To keep us from finding the killer, man.

836
00:45:19,117 --> 00:45:21,483
That's what I would do
if I was covering my tracks.

837
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:24,454
He sticks us on this Baum stakeout
'cause it's more misdirection.

838
00:45:24,489 --> 00:45:25,649
Makes sense.

839
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:27,885
I hate that Turk, man.

840
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,556
(buzzing)

841
00:45:56,554 --> 00:45:58,545
Hey, he's coming out.
He's coming out.

842
00:46:00,792 --> 00:46:03,124
Oh, at 2:45 in the morning.

843
00:46:06,397 --> 00:46:09,855
Is it killing time
or is he just killing time?

844
00:46:29,487 --> 00:46:31,978
Come on, Baum,
go kill someone already.

845
00:46:32,023 --> 00:46:34,548
Perez: Yeah, kill Turk, man.
He's the one setting you up.

846
00:46:34,592 --> 00:46:36,059
Do us all a favor.

847
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:43,690
Hey, did you see Turk's
marksmanship scores?

848
00:46:43,735 --> 00:46:45,293
Did you see this?
It's ridiculous.

849
00:46:45,336 --> 00:46:47,236
Service... 99,
70 out of 100.

850
00:46:47,271 --> 00:46:50,707
Combat Association awards,
department commendations.

851
00:46:50,742 --> 00:46:53,142
This guy could take out your left nut
at 50 yards.

852
00:46:56,414 --> 00:46:58,439
Perez: Did you see the computer
trajectories, man?

853
00:46:58,483 --> 00:46:59,916
Not one stray slug.

854
00:46:59,951 --> 00:47:02,283
Even Berkowitz put a couple
in the Corinthian leather.

855
00:47:07,425 --> 00:47:09,893
Riley: What about Karen?
She come up with anything new?

856
00:47:09,927 --> 00:47:11,792
Perez: No, not yet.

857
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:13,797
If Baum kills somebody
I don't want us to be in the car

858
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:16,197
waiting when it happens, okay?

859
00:47:18,036 --> 00:47:19,697
I'll go.

860
00:47:19,737 --> 00:47:21,728
Attaboy, Teddy, attaboy.

861
00:47:21,773 --> 00:47:23,138
I'm proud of you, son.

862
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:28,301
(lighter clicks)

863
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:36,513
(cocks gun)
You're Perez, right?

864
00:47:36,554 --> 00:47:37,885
Yeah.

865
00:47:37,922 --> 00:47:39,617
I'm Martin Baum.

866
00:47:43,227 --> 00:47:45,354
I got a permit for this.

867
00:47:45,396 --> 00:47:48,126
I work security
in the diamond district.

868
00:47:48,166 --> 00:47:50,964
So you figure it's a cop
doing the poetry killings?

869
00:47:51,002 --> 00:47:53,869
Someone says, "Check out Baum.
He thinks he got a raw deal."

870
00:47:53,905 --> 00:47:56,339
That's what passes
for police work these days?

871
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:57,864
Do you think
you got a raw deal?

872
00:47:57,909 --> 00:47:59,774
Damn straight.

873
00:47:59,811 --> 00:48:02,143
- Life sucks.
- Yeah.

874
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:04,740
- Everything okay, Simon?
- Teddy, where the fuck were you, man?

875
00:48:04,782 --> 00:48:07,080
Anything else you want to tell us,
Lieutenant Baum?

876
00:48:07,118 --> 00:48:11,020
- I got something for you in my pocket.
- Huh-uh!

877
00:48:12,557 --> 00:48:17,290
A passport, credit card receipts,
boarding passes.

878
00:48:17,328 --> 00:48:19,319
The day Brady was killed

879
00:48:19,363 --> 00:48:21,532
I was escorting a client
to Brazil.

880
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:28,964
Man: Judgment is
the dominion of the Lord.

881
00:48:29,006 --> 00:48:31,907
And if this person,
this worthless rapist

882
00:48:31,943 --> 00:48:34,468
or murderer,
as you describe him,

883
00:48:34,512 --> 00:48:37,913
if he is truly repentant
and seeks absolution,

884
00:48:37,949 --> 00:48:40,315
it must be granted to him.

885
00:48:40,351 --> 00:48:42,785
Your name doesn't ring a bell,

886
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:47,086
but I've had so many
altar boys over the years.

887
00:48:47,125 --> 00:48:49,821
(muffled gunshot)

888
00:48:51,195 --> 00:48:53,186
Turk's voice: So many altar boys

889
00:48:53,231 --> 00:48:55,927
that it's hard to remember
their names.

890
00:48:55,967 --> 00:48:59,027
My name is David Fisk,
Detective First Grade.

891
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:01,334
You may not
remember me now,

892
00:49:01,372 --> 00:49:04,535
but I guarantee you'll remember my name
for the rest of your life.

893
00:49:04,575 --> 00:49:08,443
Father Connell,
may he rot in hell.

894
00:49:08,479 --> 00:49:10,947
13 down, one to go.

895
00:49:10,982 --> 00:49:13,644
(bells tolling)

896
00:49:13,684 --> 00:49:16,050
(police radio chatter)

897
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:22,985
Karen: White underwear
below the knee.

898
00:49:23,027 --> 00:49:25,495
- (camera shutter clicking)
- Briefs-style.

899
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:27,964
Large tweezers.

900
00:49:27,999 --> 00:49:31,457
I am removing a card that has been
inserted in the rectum of the deceased

901
00:49:31,502 --> 00:49:35,529
and placing it
in a plastic evidence bag.

902
00:49:38,242 --> 00:49:41,973
- I'll be right back.
- All right.

903
00:49:43,648 --> 00:49:46,276
Hey. It's another one,

904
00:49:46,317 --> 00:49:48,512
handwritten.

905
00:49:51,789 --> 00:49:54,553
"The old man
who the children trust,

906
00:49:54,592 --> 00:49:58,221
Unable to control his lust,

907
00:49:58,262 --> 00:50:01,163
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

908
00:50:01,199 --> 00:50:05,260
The church can't stop him.
Someone must."

909
00:50:06,637 --> 00:50:08,628
I'll see what else I can find.

910
00:50:14,212 --> 00:50:16,476
What's the matter with you?

911
00:50:16,514 --> 00:50:18,812
Father Connell gave me
my first communion

912
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:21,613
back in Bensonhurst.

913
00:50:23,988 --> 00:50:26,479
Hey, guys.
Sorry we didn't get a chance to call.

914
00:50:26,524 --> 00:50:29,584
- Yeah, I bet you are.
- Go over there, take a look around.

915
00:50:29,627 --> 00:50:31,754
We'll compare notes later, okay?

916
00:50:31,796 --> 00:50:34,924
Looks like our friend just settled
an old score with the priest,

917
00:50:34,966 --> 00:50:36,957
left him with his pants down.

918
00:50:37,001 --> 00:50:38,628
- Come on.
- No, look.

919
00:50:38,669 --> 00:50:40,136
Come on, don't talk like that.

920
00:50:40,171 --> 00:50:42,139
- Hey, look for yourself.
- Have a little respect.

921
00:50:43,674 --> 00:50:46,871
Next thing they're gonna tell us
Lieutenant Baum was an altar boy here.

922
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:50,347
Tell me about it.
These two guys fucking stink.

923
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:52,713
Look, doctor,
you read the poems.

924
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:54,980
It is possible, right,
that this guy is a cop?

925
00:50:55,019 --> 00:50:57,385
I've never seen it.

926
00:50:57,421 --> 00:51:00,219
I've never even heard
about a cop serial killer.

927
00:51:00,258 --> 00:51:02,419
Come on, girls,
let's go, let's go.

928
00:51:03,427 --> 00:51:07,386
Yeah. Go go go go go
go go go go!

929
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:08,455
Safe.

930
00:51:08,499 --> 00:51:10,967
Doc, give us a tip.
How are we gonna catch this guy?

931
00:51:11,002 --> 00:51:12,993
You don't have to worry
about that.

932
00:51:13,037 --> 00:51:14,698
He wants to get caught.

933
00:51:17,008 --> 00:51:19,670
You don't have any better place
to have lunch?

934
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:21,507
I wanted to thank you.

935
00:51:21,545 --> 00:51:23,274
What, about Spider?

936
00:51:23,314 --> 00:51:24,975
Yeah.

937
00:51:25,016 --> 00:51:27,610
And for looking in on me
at the hospital

938
00:51:27,652 --> 00:51:29,176
and the encouragement.

939
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:30,517
Why would he want that?

940
00:51:30,554 --> 00:51:33,114
After a while
getting away with it isn't enough.

941
00:51:33,157 --> 00:51:35,148
Jessica: So is your daughter
on the team?

942
00:51:35,192 --> 00:51:38,025
No, she used to play,
but now she's 25, living in California,

943
00:51:38,062 --> 00:51:40,758
five years sober
and working as a nurse.

944
00:51:40,798 --> 00:51:42,959
And her mother?

945
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,025
Her mother died
when she was very young.

946
00:51:46,037 --> 00:51:48,972
Doctor: He wants everybody to know
that he got away with it,

947
00:51:49,006 --> 00:51:53,033
to show everybody
just how brilliant he is.

948
00:51:53,077 --> 00:51:56,240
Most of these killings were criminals
in Rooster's and his beat, right?

949
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,145
And then he all but threatens
to kill Van Luytens

950
00:51:58,182 --> 00:52:00,150
in front of hundreds of witnesses.
And then he sends us

951
00:52:00,184 --> 00:52:03,244
on this crazy wild goose chase
after Lieutenant Baum, didn't he?

952
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:05,278
- Yes, he did.
- Why would he do that? Why?

953
00:52:05,323 --> 00:52:07,848
You gotta show me more than that.
So far you got shit.

954
00:52:07,892 --> 00:52:09,484
- Give him more, man.
- You want more?

955
00:52:09,527 --> 00:52:12,155
- How about the church records?
- The very ones that Turk was

956
00:52:12,196 --> 00:52:14,130
so diligently pursuing.
How about that?

957
00:52:14,165 --> 00:52:17,066
It turns out our most recent victim,
the late Father Connell,

958
00:52:17,101 --> 00:52:19,831
was moved all over the place...
eight parishes in 20 years.

959
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:22,361
Why would they do that
with a Catholic priest? It's obvious.

960
00:52:22,406 --> 00:52:24,897
He's giving the children
more than communion behind the altar.

961
00:52:24,942 --> 00:52:27,376
Now Turk already admits
to knowing this guy as a child.

962
00:52:27,411 --> 00:52:28,742
It's very plausible.

963
00:52:30,181 --> 00:52:33,344
Lieutenant: This priest,
this Father Connell,

964
00:52:33,384 --> 00:52:35,079
he gave you your first
holy communion, eh?

965
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:36,245
He did.

966
00:52:36,287 --> 00:52:39,518
Did he every try to do
anything inappropriate? I mean...

967
00:52:39,557 --> 00:52:41,548
I know what you mean.
No, never.

968
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:45,251
Okay, fine.
Is there any reason

969
00:52:45,296 --> 00:52:47,526
why somebody out there
might think that he did?

970
00:52:47,565 --> 00:52:49,123
No.

971
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:51,498
Am I a suspect here, Lieutenant?

972
00:52:52,536 --> 00:52:54,561
No,

973
00:52:54,605 --> 00:52:58,439
but these bodies
are starting to smell.

974
00:52:58,476 --> 00:53:01,070
A lot of it is drifting
in your direction.

975
00:53:01,112 --> 00:53:03,103
Drifting or being pushed?

976
00:53:03,147 --> 00:53:05,240
What can I say?

977
00:53:05,282 --> 00:53:07,716
You got connections
to most of these victims.

978
00:53:07,752 --> 00:53:10,687
You're not exactly
Mother Teresa.

979
00:53:11,989 --> 00:53:14,890
I never had any problem
with that priest.

980
00:53:14,925 --> 00:53:17,860
Okay. Okay, fine.

981
00:53:17,895 --> 00:53:20,625
That settles it.

982
00:53:26,771 --> 00:53:28,864
I had a talk with Riley and Perez.

983
00:53:28,906 --> 00:53:30,430
Good cops.

984
00:53:30,474 --> 00:53:32,942
Don't fuck around, okay?
Just listen.

985
00:53:32,977 --> 00:53:34,239
I'm listening.

986
00:53:34,278 --> 00:53:36,678
They think
Turk might be our guy.

987
00:53:40,584 --> 00:53:42,814
Oh, man. I gotta tell you,

988
00:53:42,853 --> 00:53:45,549
from where I'm sitting
that is so fucking funny.

989
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:47,648
You can't take that seriously.

990
00:53:47,691 --> 00:53:50,660
Everybody has pretty much
accepted the fact

991
00:53:50,694 --> 00:53:53,254
- that we're chasing one of our own.
- But it ain't Turk.

992
00:53:53,297 --> 00:53:55,060
Sure as I'm sitting here
he ain't the guy.

993
00:53:55,099 --> 00:53:56,726
- You know that?
- Yes, I do.

994
00:53:56,767 --> 00:53:59,235
- How do you know that?
- Because I know it.

995
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:01,830
I know it to a moral certainty.

996
00:54:01,872 --> 00:54:03,339
Okay?

997
00:54:04,542 --> 00:54:06,533
This priest,

998
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:09,171
this Father Connell...

999
00:54:09,213 --> 00:54:11,511
he was Turk's priest
when he was a kid.

1000
00:54:11,549 --> 00:54:12,573
He told you that.

1001
00:54:12,616 --> 00:54:14,914
He didn't tell me this priest
was a child molester.

1002
00:54:14,952 --> 00:54:17,887
- I can't believe this bullshit.
- Believe it, all right?

1003
00:54:17,922 --> 00:54:20,482
- Turk's a good guy.
- You understand?

1004
00:54:20,524 --> 00:54:22,788
- He's the best cop you got.
- Don't you tell me what I gotta do.

1005
00:54:22,827 --> 00:54:24,886
Don't you say a goddamn word
to him about this either,

1006
00:54:24,929 --> 00:54:26,863
or you're finished.

1007
00:54:30,201 --> 00:54:33,693
(humming a tune)

1008
00:54:36,807 --> 00:54:38,798
Can I speak now?

1009
00:54:38,843 --> 00:54:40,640
Feel free.

1010
00:54:41,645 --> 00:54:45,479
He cares.
You know what I'm saying?

1011
00:54:45,516 --> 00:54:48,417
Turk cares about people.

1012
00:54:49,753 --> 00:54:52,745
I know he runs around
like a pit bull on crack sometimes.

1013
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:55,384
It doesn't matter.

1014
00:54:55,426 --> 00:54:57,690
He cares about protecting people.

1015
00:54:57,728 --> 00:54:59,787
And if you don't back him,

1016
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:03,701
you will regret it.

1017
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:24,881
(bangs)

1018
00:55:24,922 --> 00:55:26,412
Jesus.

1019
00:55:26,457 --> 00:55:28,186
Sorry.

1020
00:55:28,225 --> 00:55:30,921
I just never rattled
anyone's cage before.

1021
00:55:30,961 --> 00:55:34,021
- Got a minute?
- Yeah, what's up?

1022
00:55:34,064 --> 00:55:37,465
You know me and Turk
are buddies, right?

1023
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:38,991
Of course.

1024
00:55:39,036 --> 00:55:40,526
I'd do anything for him.

1025
00:55:40,571 --> 00:55:42,971
He would do anything for you.

1026
00:55:43,007 --> 00:55:44,235
Would you?

1027
00:55:44,275 --> 00:55:45,799
Would I what?

1028
00:55:45,843 --> 00:55:47,868
Would you do anything for him?

1029
00:55:51,415 --> 00:55:53,212
I don't know...
where is this going?

1030
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:55,275
He wants you
to have sex with me.

1031
00:55:57,421 --> 00:55:59,321
Really?

1032
00:56:01,225 --> 00:56:03,056
He wouldn't mind.

1033
00:56:03,093 --> 00:56:05,789
But that's not why I'm here.

1034
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:08,491
Okay, why are you here?

1035
00:56:08,532 --> 00:56:11,763
Where were you
the night Rambo was killed

1036
00:56:11,802 --> 00:56:14,771
and Trager?
Got an alibi for those nights?

1037
00:56:16,273 --> 00:56:19,504
I mean, did you know either one
those guys before they were murdered?

1038
00:56:19,543 --> 00:56:22,512
Makes you uncomfortable
when I talk like that.

1039
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:25,344
You look like you're guilty.
You're not guilty.

1040
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:27,475
I know that.
You didn't kill those guys, did you?

1041
00:56:31,155 --> 00:56:34,181
Now you know what Turk feels.

1042
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:41,959
I need you to get me
some information

1043
00:56:41,999 --> 00:56:44,024
discreetly.

1044
00:56:45,669 --> 00:56:47,102
Can you do that for me?

1045
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:49,401
You got it.

1046
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,101
Absolutely.

1047
00:56:51,141 --> 00:56:53,132
Let's solve these fucking murders.

1048
00:56:55,312 --> 00:56:57,473
(phone rings)

1049
00:56:57,514 --> 00:56:58,879
Oh.

1050
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:01,009
- Rooster: Hey, boy genius.
- Perfect timing, buddy.

1051
00:57:01,051 --> 00:57:03,076
Listen, you really worked
on Hingis, didn't you?

1052
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,815
He was all worked up
about my partner.

1053
00:57:04,855 --> 00:57:06,755
Good. He should be.

1054
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:09,350
I think we should sit down,
see if we can square things, okay?

1055
00:57:09,393 --> 00:57:12,590
All right. Want to meet at Montrose
at 8:00 PM?

1056
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:15,929
Could you make that 9:00?
I gotta meet an old friend.

1057
00:57:15,966 --> 00:57:17,593
Yeah, sure, whatever you want.

1058
00:57:20,137 --> 00:57:23,436
(blues playing)
#Baby's got issues #

1059
00:57:23,474 --> 00:57:26,932
#Baby's got pains... #

1060
00:57:26,977 --> 00:57:28,968
- Hey, fellows.
- Hey.

1061
00:57:29,013 --> 00:57:32,176
Thanks for coming.

1062
00:57:32,216 --> 00:57:34,844
- This here is Cheryl Brooks.
- Hello, Cheryl Brooks.

1063
00:57:34,885 --> 00:57:36,876
Cheryl's got something to tell you.

1064
00:57:38,055 --> 00:57:41,684
My daughter Lynn

1065
00:57:41,725 --> 00:57:44,250
died four years ago.

1066
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:47,229
She was 10 years old.
She was raped and she was murdered.

1067
00:57:49,333 --> 00:57:53,463
The guy I was living with,
Charles...

1068
00:57:53,504 --> 00:57:54,664
Charles Randall.

1069
00:57:54,705 --> 00:57:57,799
Yeah, Charles Randall... he did it.

1070
00:57:57,841 --> 00:58:00,639
Why are you telling us this?

1071
00:58:00,678 --> 00:58:03,806
Because he got off for that.
He was acquitted at trial.

1072
00:58:03,847 --> 00:58:06,077
- Because?
- Because?

1073
00:58:07,851 --> 00:58:10,149
I testified for him.

1074
00:58:10,187 --> 00:58:13,020
- You did what?
- I said he was with me.

1075
00:58:14,591 --> 00:58:18,288
You see, Cheryl here is
a very forgiving person,

1076
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:20,626
unlike us hard-asses.

1077
00:58:20,664 --> 00:58:22,928
- He threatened to kill me.
- Okay, Cheryl.

1078
00:58:22,966 --> 00:58:26,424
Now you say goodbye
to the nice officers

1079
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:30,304
and you go on back home.

1080
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:33,138
Don't drink yourself to death.

1081
00:58:35,245 --> 00:58:37,770
Okay, so...

1082
00:58:37,815 --> 00:58:40,181
eh?

1083
00:58:43,087 --> 00:58:45,817
I want to hear you say it.

1084
00:58:45,856 --> 00:58:48,450
Come on, say it.

1085
00:58:52,896 --> 00:58:56,889
We planted the gun
in Randall's apartment, okay?

1086
00:58:56,934 --> 00:58:59,266
I said it. Happy?

1087
00:58:59,303 --> 00:59:00,895
- Thank you.
- Yes, I am.

1088
00:59:00,938 --> 00:59:03,702
I'd do it again if I had to
'cause that fucking maggot

1089
00:59:03,741 --> 00:59:07,541
could rot away for all eternity.
I'd sleep just fine.

1090
00:59:07,578 --> 00:59:08,977
So what do you want from us?

1091
00:59:09,012 --> 00:59:11,503
You guys think
my partner's a serial killer.

1092
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:13,345
You're way off.

1093
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:16,443
You like Turk for this thing?
Go have your fun.

1094
00:59:16,487 --> 00:59:18,887
I'll go along with you.

1095
00:59:18,922 --> 00:59:21,482
I'll even help you.

1096
00:59:21,525 --> 00:59:25,188
But do not drag up Chuck Randall
and that fucking gun,

1097
00:59:25,229 --> 00:59:28,665
because if he walks out of jail
he's gonna end up dead.

1098
00:59:28,699 --> 00:59:30,758
Excuse me?

1099
00:59:32,336 --> 00:59:35,772
I'll put two
through his fucking head

1100
00:59:35,806 --> 00:59:38,366
myself.

1101
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:40,672
Done deal.

1102
00:59:40,711 --> 00:59:43,839
(soprano singing)

1103
00:59:53,724 --> 00:59:56,659
My grandmother loved opera.

1104
00:59:56,693 --> 00:59:58,718
She supported us by sewing.

1105
00:59:58,762 --> 01:00:01,856
I used to thread needles
for my grandmother.

1106
01:00:01,899 --> 01:00:04,197
- Gave all her money to church.
- You admired her?

1107
01:00:04,234 --> 01:00:06,361
I worshiped her.

1108
01:00:06,403 --> 01:00:09,201
Rooster? Yeah, he's religious,
goes to church.

1109
01:00:09,239 --> 01:00:10,934
Prosky: How about you?

1110
01:00:10,974 --> 01:00:14,569
Turk's voice: Our job is keeping
99% of the population safe

1111
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:18,047
from the other 1%.

1112
01:00:18,081 --> 01:00:21,676
The problem is that we have to
spend half our lives with that 1%.

1113
01:00:21,718 --> 01:00:23,515
And the better we do that job,

1114
01:00:23,554 --> 01:00:26,114
the less the other 99% think
they need us.

1115
01:00:26,156 --> 01:00:28,784
They're clueless.

1116
01:00:28,826 --> 01:00:30,760
The only ones paying attention
on the street

1117
01:00:30,794 --> 01:00:33,194
are the cops and the criminals.
Everyone else is just

1118
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:35,994
going somewhere
or shopping.

1119
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:43,833
- Umpire: Out.
- Come on.

1120
01:00:43,874 --> 01:00:46,365
I got an order here placing you
on restricted duty.

1121
01:00:46,410 --> 01:00:48,901
Now in plain English that means
you'll work at your desk.

1122
01:00:48,946 --> 01:00:51,005
You might want to cooperate
with the shrink

1123
01:00:51,048 --> 01:00:53,812
next time you two meet,
and you will meet again.

1124
01:00:57,754 --> 01:01:00,689
Cool my fucking heels.
Cool my fucking heels, huh?

1125
01:01:00,724 --> 01:01:03,454
I'm gonna blow a fucking hole
in that motherfucker Perez

1126
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:06,360
and blow right through his head
for putting me through this bullshit.

1127
01:01:06,396 --> 01:01:08,296
- Turk.
- Fuck, I'm gonna...

1128
01:01:08,332 --> 01:01:09,629
kill that motherfucker.

1129
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:12,464
Calm down. What the hell is it?
You're making all the wrong moves.

1130
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:14,333
What are you talking about?
This ain't a chess game, partner.

1131
01:01:14,371 --> 01:01:16,805
Who knows? Maybe it is.
You go at Perez now...

1132
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:19,331
you know what's gonna happen?
You're gonna walk right into a trap.

1133
01:01:19,376 --> 01:01:21,537
You are.
They're just waiting for you.

1134
01:01:21,578 --> 01:01:23,273
Fucking Hingis.

1135
01:01:23,313 --> 01:01:25,577
Fucking Hingis believes him.

1136
01:01:25,616 --> 01:01:28,608
He actually fucking believes
that motherfucking Perez.

1137
01:01:28,652 --> 01:01:30,142
Stay back. Wait.

1138
01:01:30,187 --> 01:01:33,623
Wait for the right time,
then fire away.

1139
01:01:33,657 --> 01:01:35,522
Not now. Now is not the right time.

1140
01:01:35,559 --> 01:01:37,857
Believe me.

1141
01:01:37,895 --> 01:01:40,227
You believe me?
Now is not the time.

1142
01:01:40,264 --> 01:01:41,356
Uh-huh.

1143
01:01:41,398 --> 01:01:43,525
- Please.
- Yeah.

1144
01:01:43,567 --> 01:01:47,333
Hey, Turk, I gotta skip tonight.
My class ran late.

1145
01:01:47,371 --> 01:01:49,771
(over phone) But I'll see you
tomorrow, all right?

1146
01:01:49,806 --> 01:01:52,707
And I'm sorry about what happened
with you and Lieutenant Hingis today.

1147
01:01:52,743 --> 01:01:54,870
It's gonna be fine.
It'll blow over.

1148
01:01:54,912 --> 01:01:57,847
People are just... everyone's crazy.
People are overreacting.

1149
01:01:57,881 --> 01:02:00,543
All right? Good night.

1150
01:02:06,790 --> 01:02:08,951
It's a cop, it's a cop, it's a cop.

1151
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:18,064
(car engine starts)

1152
01:02:18,101 --> 01:02:20,501
What you got for me, good-looking?

1153
01:02:25,709 --> 01:02:28,769
Mark my words, there's a reason
Perez is gunning for me.

1154
01:02:28,812 --> 01:02:31,542
- (tenor singing)
- Perez is too smart to be that stupid.

1155
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:34,209
For one thing, all that college-boy crap...
that's bullshit.

1156
01:02:34,251 --> 01:02:36,481
He did one year at SUNY,
only one year.

1157
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:37,509
No kidding.

1158
01:02:37,554 --> 01:02:39,954
They threw him out...
disruptive influence.

1159
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:42,686
And I hear from the 240 he mixed it up bad
with a captain over there.

1160
01:02:42,726 --> 01:02:44,956
The guy is a total
fucking asshole.

1161
01:02:44,995 --> 01:02:46,826
(man with Russian accent)
BMW 3 series,

1162
01:02:46,863 --> 01:02:49,195
Mercedes CLK... too light.

1163
01:02:49,232 --> 01:02:52,201
BMW 7 series...
the biggest engine.

1164
01:02:52,235 --> 01:02:54,897
That's what you have to get.
If they shoot at you,

1165
01:02:54,938 --> 01:02:57,736
you still want
to get the fuck out of there...

1166
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:59,435
(men laughing)

1167
01:02:59,476 --> 01:03:01,307
(imitating)
Bentley... very good

1168
01:03:01,345 --> 01:03:04,109
because can fuck two prostitutes
in back seat

1169
01:03:04,147 --> 01:03:07,878
and mount flame-thrower
on the hood. Da?

1170
01:03:07,918 --> 01:03:09,249
Da.

1171
01:03:09,286 --> 01:03:11,618
- Man: What about a Cadillac?
- Russian: Come on,

1172
01:03:11,655 --> 01:03:15,147
the fucking car can't turn
fucking corner. Are you kidding me?

1173
01:03:15,192 --> 01:03:17,023
You know either one of those
Neanderthals?

1174
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:19,824
The wop is Joe Scianci from Bensonhurst.
He's a mid-level guy.

1175
01:03:19,863 --> 01:03:21,797
What about Ivan?

1176
01:03:21,832 --> 01:03:23,663
Russian guy,
Yevgeny Magulat,

1177
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:27,830
an enforcer for the Italians,
works with Gambinos a lot.

1178
01:03:29,006 --> 01:03:30,837
(speaking Russian)

1179
01:03:32,275 --> 01:03:34,937
That shit's getting to me.

1180
01:03:34,978 --> 01:03:37,003
I know it's getting to you.

1181
01:03:38,749 --> 01:03:41,183
Shit gets to me too, you know,

1182
01:03:41,218 --> 01:03:44,312
but I take it in, I let it out
on my own terms.

1183
01:03:45,922 --> 01:03:47,981
I bet you didn't write
one word down

1184
01:03:48,025 --> 01:03:49,925
in that little notebook
Prosky gave us.

1185
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:52,520
Of course not. Did you?

1186
01:03:52,562 --> 01:03:54,894
Yeah, it's great.

1187
01:03:56,466 --> 01:03:58,832
It helps me put things in perspective.

1188
01:03:58,869 --> 01:04:02,862
You know what I'm saying?
Write it down, get it out.

1189
01:04:02,906 --> 01:04:05,431
- You should try this.
- Let's have a look.

1190
01:04:05,475 --> 01:04:08,103
What, are you kidding me?
Oh, come on, come on.

1191
01:04:08,145 --> 01:04:10,613
This belongs to me... private.

1192
01:04:10,647 --> 01:04:15,016
- You don't want to let me see?
- Close to my heart. No, sir.

1193
01:04:15,052 --> 01:04:17,247
I just got sick
of the whole fucking game...

1194
01:04:17,287 --> 01:04:19,755
run around looking for clues,
making arrests,

1195
01:04:19,790 --> 01:04:22,315
write reports, testify, cut deals.

1196
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:25,260
It was all just so much
fucking bullshit.

1197
01:04:25,295 --> 01:04:28,128
(man whistles)

1198
01:04:28,165 --> 01:04:29,325
Detective...

1199
01:04:29,366 --> 01:04:31,391
(muffled gunshots)

1200
01:04:35,072 --> 01:04:36,471
Then it all got real simple.

1201
01:04:36,506 --> 01:04:39,532
Yeah, Detective Perez here.
Hey, brother, what's up?

1202
01:04:39,576 --> 01:04:42,511
I hate scumbags. I like shooting people.
What was I giving up?

1203
01:04:42,546 --> 01:04:45,538
Perez: Hey, look, I set the meeting up
with Rooster first thing tomorrow.

1204
01:04:45,582 --> 01:04:48,983
Come on, you gotta be fast, man.
I don't want Turk getting wind of anything.

1205
01:04:49,019 --> 01:04:51,385
A retirement party and a gold watch?

1206
01:04:51,421 --> 01:04:54,219
A handshake from the mayor
and my name on some fucking plaque?

1207
01:04:54,257 --> 01:04:56,987
(speaking indistinctly)

1208
01:04:57,027 --> 01:05:00,428
(gunshots)

1209
01:05:00,464 --> 01:05:01,658
Big fucking deal.

1210
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:04,924
It's better this way.

1211
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:09,569
Now everybody knows
who I was and where I stood.

1212
01:05:49,613 --> 01:05:51,274
(dials)

1213
01:05:53,049 --> 01:05:55,040
Hey, it's me.

1214
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:59,978
Listen, I think somebody
followed me here... home.

1215
01:06:00,023 --> 01:06:02,491
He's outside right now.

1216
01:06:02,526 --> 01:06:06,223
Can you come over or...?

1217
01:06:06,263 --> 01:06:09,323
Just call me back, okay?
All right.

1218
01:06:24,614 --> 01:06:27,048
(intercom buzzing)

1219
01:06:34,758 --> 01:06:36,749
(cocks gun)

1220
01:06:39,496 --> 01:06:41,862
Don't move.

1221
01:06:54,744 --> 01:06:57,770
- Come on, open up.
- Turk?

1222
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:05,180
I just called you.

1223
01:07:05,222 --> 01:07:06,814
Put the gun down.

1224
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:08,847
There's a car following me.

1225
01:07:08,892 --> 01:07:11,656
Put the gun down.
Put the gun down.

1226
01:07:15,565 --> 01:07:17,055
Have you got
something to tell me?

1227
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:18,897
About what?

1228
01:07:18,935 --> 01:07:21,495
Trager, Randall.

1229
01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:23,529
Did you sneak
into my apartment?

1230
01:07:23,573 --> 01:07:25,564
What are they doing
on your computer?

1231
01:07:25,609 --> 01:07:27,839
I was checking
all the links in the case.

1232
01:07:31,181 --> 01:07:32,876
Are you hiding something
from me?

1233
01:07:36,119 --> 01:07:37,677
Huh?

1234
01:07:39,189 --> 01:07:42,056
I just received this... this poem.

1235
01:07:42,092 --> 01:07:44,686
A poem?
Not worth mentioning, huh?

1236
01:07:44,728 --> 01:07:47,253
The handwriting
doesn't even match.

1237
01:07:47,297 --> 01:07:49,492
It's a fake.

1238
01:07:49,532 --> 01:07:51,523
Did you write it?

1239
01:07:53,370 --> 01:07:55,930
Did you write it?

1240
01:08:00,143 --> 01:08:02,703
What the hell is going on here?

1241
01:08:02,746 --> 01:08:04,907
You're spending a lot of time
with Perez, aren't you?

1242
01:08:04,948 --> 01:08:06,813
Yeah, I've been working the case.

1243
01:08:06,850 --> 01:08:09,011
What, are you jealous?

1244
01:08:09,052 --> 01:08:11,816
Can I trust you?

1245
01:08:13,957 --> 01:08:16,687
- Yes.
- Okay.

1246
01:08:16,726 --> 01:08:19,160
Get me anything and everything
that you can find out

1247
01:08:19,195 --> 01:08:21,629
about Perez or Riley,
what they know about me.

1248
01:08:23,366 --> 01:08:25,197
Everything.

1249
01:08:25,235 --> 01:08:27,703
Karen, don't play me.

1250
01:08:28,972 --> 01:08:32,635
Hingis: I am leaning much further
into saying that it is a cop.

1251
01:08:32,676 --> 01:08:36,009
Perez: Tell you what... I'm moving
past the leaning stage

1252
01:08:36,046 --> 01:08:38,844
and I'm moving towards the
l-know-for-sure-it's-a-fucking-cop stage,

1253
01:08:38,882 --> 01:08:41,214
considering how expertly
he shot the shit out of my house.

1254
01:08:41,251 --> 01:08:43,515
Hingis: Oh my God.
Are you hurt?

1255
01:08:43,553 --> 01:08:45,646
Am I hurt? Am I hurt?
He wants to know if I'm hurt.

1256
01:08:45,689 --> 01:08:47,223
Actually, he's dead.

1257
01:08:47,223 --> 01:08:49,885
(sirens wailing)

1258
01:08:49,926 --> 01:08:53,259
- Rooster: His name is Magulat.
- Turk: The guy we saw at Salerno's.

1259
01:08:53,296 --> 01:08:56,356
Yeah, he's in intensive care
at St. Luke's.

1260
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:58,390
They think he's the guy

1261
01:08:58,435 --> 01:09:00,903
- chopped off Yakov Pearlstein's head.
- What do you think?

1262
01:09:00,937 --> 01:09:03,167
You think he's a victim,
or could he be our suspect?

1263
01:09:03,206 --> 01:09:06,232
I don't know, but either way
I think it's gonna be fun.

1264
01:09:07,277 --> 01:09:10,178
Doctor, what's the story?

1265
01:09:10,213 --> 01:09:13,205
He's one of the toughest human beings
I've ever come into contact with.

1266
01:09:13,249 --> 01:09:15,012
We took six bullets
out of him.

1267
01:09:15,051 --> 01:09:16,916
Six? Whoo!

1268
01:09:16,953 --> 01:09:19,717
Three from the night he was wounded,
three from previous shootings.

1269
01:09:19,756 --> 01:09:21,656
The man is a tank.

1270
01:09:21,691 --> 01:09:23,750
Do you mind if I talk to him
a little bit?

1271
01:09:23,793 --> 01:09:26,421
His jaw's wired shut,
but go ahead.

1272
01:09:26,463 --> 01:09:29,364
That's okay. I'll ask the questions.
He can just grunt.

1273
01:09:29,399 --> 01:09:32,334
Hey, Yevgeny.

1274
01:09:32,369 --> 01:09:34,599
(snapping fingers)
Wake up.

1275
01:09:34,637 --> 01:09:39,336
That's it. Wake up,
you big fucking grizzly bear.

1276
01:09:39,376 --> 01:09:41,776
You don't speak Russian?

1277
01:09:41,811 --> 01:09:45,406
Swoboda. Swoboda. Swoboda.

1278
01:09:45,448 --> 01:09:47,939
Ron.

1279
01:09:50,553 --> 01:09:52,714
(moans)

1280
01:09:52,756 --> 01:09:55,987
I'm thinking this Russian killing machine
could be our first eyewitness.

1281
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:58,721
(beeping more rapidly)

1282
01:09:58,762 --> 01:10:01,629
Wake up, gugumuck.
You can tell us who did this to you.

1283
01:10:05,869 --> 01:10:09,305
- (grunting)
- Detective, I think that's enough.

1284
01:10:09,339 --> 01:10:12,797
Then you could tell us where you put
Yakov Pearlstein's head.

1285
01:10:14,177 --> 01:10:16,168
(laughs)

1286
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:19,113
4-3, 4-3, I need a round-the-clock
security detail

1287
01:10:19,149 --> 01:10:23,415
on a patient Magulat,
M-A-gulat,

1288
01:10:23,453 --> 01:10:25,648
St. Luke's in the ICU.

1289
01:10:27,490 --> 01:10:31,358
#I wake up in the morning... #

1290
01:10:31,394 --> 01:10:34,659
Is this the number to call
to report a case of police brutality?

1291
01:10:34,697 --> 01:10:38,155
- Cat got your tongue?
- Out on bail again?

1292
01:10:38,201 --> 01:10:40,465
What, you think you can scare me,
little bitch? What do you want?

1293
01:10:40,503 --> 01:10:42,835
Be careful, detective.
My taxes pay your salary.

1294
01:10:42,872 --> 01:10:45,466
You don't pay any fucking taxes,
you lowlife piece of shit.

1295
01:10:45,508 --> 01:10:47,874
- Get to the point, come on.
- One of your vics, Trager,

1296
01:10:47,911 --> 01:10:50,539
stole a whole lot of guns
down South.

1297
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:52,673
Same guns are turning up
on your murder scenes.

1298
01:10:52,715 --> 01:10:54,012
So it's simple...

1299
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:56,575
find stolen guns,
you got your guy.

1300
01:10:56,619 --> 01:10:58,450
So you know the guy?

1301
01:10:58,488 --> 01:11:01,286
Do you know if there's a cop out there
who might be a danger to the public?

1302
01:11:01,324 --> 01:11:04,088
I couldn't live with myself
if I just stood by and didn't say anything.

1303
01:11:04,127 --> 01:11:07,119
Look, I'm gonna give you
two seconds more. Give me yes or no.

1304
01:11:07,163 --> 01:11:10,098
Do you know the guy?
And when do I meet you to talk about it?

1305
01:11:10,133 --> 01:11:12,863
Friday, 9:00 PM, at my club.

1306
01:11:12,902 --> 01:11:14,062
I'll be there.

1307
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:16,128
Man, there's dumb
and there's dumber,

1308
01:11:16,172 --> 01:11:18,640
but this is the motherfucking dumbest
right here, man.

1309
01:11:18,675 --> 01:11:20,836
Easy, son, easy.
It's gonna be easy for you.

1310
01:11:20,877 --> 01:11:24,472
All you gotta do is be bait, that's all.
Be a little sardine for us, all right?

1311
01:11:24,514 --> 01:11:27,176
You help us... we got you covered.
Your club doesn't get hassled

1312
01:11:27,217 --> 01:11:29,742
and you don't have a revolving door
in and out of jail.

1313
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:31,378
Do we have a deal or not?

1314
01:11:31,421 --> 01:11:34,822
Yeah, but your boy come in here
and go Hannibal Lecter on my ass,

1315
01:11:34,858 --> 01:11:37,383
I don't want no Jodie fucking Foster
coming through the door.

1316
01:11:37,427 --> 01:11:39,258
I want the goddamn
Marine Corps, man.

1317
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:42,924
#Since Color Me Badd was singing
"I wanna sex you up"...#

1318
01:11:46,436 --> 01:11:49,166
(footsteps)

1319
01:11:59,616 --> 01:12:01,641
(heart monitor beeping)

1320
01:12:11,961 --> 01:12:13,451
Evening, detective.

1321
01:12:13,496 --> 01:12:16,699
You want one? It's shit,
but it's better than nothing, right?

1322
01:12:16,699 --> 01:12:19,930
Turk's voice: As soon as I heard
the fucking Russian didn't die

1323
01:12:19,969 --> 01:12:22,233
I knew things would never
be the same.

1324
01:12:22,272 --> 01:12:24,433
I had to change the rules,

1325
01:12:24,474 --> 01:12:26,465
the strategy.

1326
01:12:26,509 --> 01:12:30,275
I had to be bold, do something
that could never be undone.

1327
01:12:38,121 --> 01:12:40,423
I went for the unforgivable.

1328
01:13:01,611 --> 01:13:03,602
(Karen grunting)

1329
01:13:07,517 --> 01:13:10,213
No. Please. No.

1330
01:13:12,355 --> 01:13:14,789
(crying)

1331
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:35,108
Karen over phone: Did you hear
anything I just said?

1332
01:13:36,279 --> 01:13:40,010
How exactly could I be
blowing this out of proportion?

1333
01:13:40,049 --> 01:13:42,210
That psycho just assaulted me.

1334
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:45,550
I am telling you
he is a classic sociopath.

1335
01:13:45,588 --> 01:13:47,715
Okay okay,
I'll look into it, all right?

1336
01:13:47,757 --> 01:13:49,247
I'll look into it.

1337
01:13:49,292 --> 01:13:51,453
You stay the hell away from here.
Understood?

1338
01:13:51,494 --> 01:13:53,291
Understood?

1339
01:13:55,365 --> 01:13:56,696
Fuck that.

1340
01:14:08,111 --> 01:14:10,409
Man: Check the ball,
check the ball.

1341
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:11,879
(players chattering)

1342
01:14:11,914 --> 01:14:15,145
I got the ball. I got the ball. I got the ball.
Stay on him. Stay on him.

1343
01:14:15,184 --> 01:14:17,118
Karen: Excuse me,
I'm Detective Corelli.

1344
01:14:17,153 --> 01:14:20,088
- I need to see your reservation book.
- Woman: Sure. Help yourself.

1345
01:14:27,530 --> 01:14:29,760
- Thank you.
- Anytime.

1346
01:14:29,799 --> 01:14:31,494
Yes, this is Detective Corelli.

1347
01:14:31,534 --> 01:14:33,968
I've been trying to reach
Detectives Perez and Riley

1348
01:14:34,003 --> 01:14:35,937
and I can't seem
to locate them.

1349
01:14:35,972 --> 01:14:38,964
- Perez: I like to party.
- That's nothing. I was into Kiss.

1350
01:14:39,008 --> 01:14:40,999
I used to run
around the house

1351
01:14:41,044 --> 01:14:43,171
with my tongue hanging out,
spitting fake blood.

1352
01:14:43,212 --> 01:14:44,509
I need to speak to them
urgently.

1353
01:14:44,547 --> 01:14:46,742
(police siren whooping)

1354
01:14:48,351 --> 01:14:51,752
Yes, I understand,
but I need the location, please.

1355
01:15:15,812 --> 01:15:17,109
(buzzes)

1356
01:15:20,316 --> 01:15:22,807
Hey, he's here.

1357
01:15:22,852 --> 01:15:24,046
Turk: Let me in.

1358
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:31,822
Thank God it's the police.

1359
01:15:31,861 --> 01:15:34,193
Yeah, so where do we go?

1360
01:15:34,230 --> 01:15:36,164
Follow me.

1361
01:15:36,199 --> 01:15:38,497
I used to play ball
a couple of blocks from here.

1362
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:39,762
Get the fuck out of here.

1363
01:15:39,802 --> 01:15:42,737
When I was a kid I wasn't afraid
to mix it up with guys like you.

1364
01:15:42,772 --> 01:15:44,069
You still ain't.

1365
01:15:44,107 --> 01:15:46,632
Yeah, nowadays
I carry a gun with me.

1366
01:15:46,676 --> 01:15:49,941
It's a bad neighborhood.

1367
01:15:49,979 --> 01:15:51,970
- It ain't bad for me.
- Yeah, well...

1368
01:15:52,014 --> 01:15:54,414
Yeah, he's inside.

1369
01:15:54,450 --> 01:15:56,008
Well, so far so good.

1370
01:15:56,052 --> 01:15:58,646
So now that we're done with
the pleasantries, what do you got for me?

1371
01:15:58,688 --> 01:15:59,916
Rooster: He's talking.

1372
01:15:59,956 --> 01:16:01,947
- What did you think he was gonna do?
- Spider: How about an apology?

1373
01:16:01,991 --> 01:16:04,755
Spider: The shit that happened to Stubby,
that wasn't supposed to happen.

1374
01:16:04,794 --> 01:16:08,321
- Rooster: Lieutenant, that's a crock of shit.
- I lost three fucking teeth that day.

1375
01:16:08,364 --> 01:16:10,628
He's not a civilian.
He's a fucking dealer.

1376
01:16:10,666 --> 01:16:12,725
- And I kept my mouth shut.
- So what?

1377
01:16:12,769 --> 01:16:16,068
You guys love those stupid gold teeth.
You should thank me.

1378
01:16:16,105 --> 01:16:18,938
Well, he's wearing a vest
and Starsky and Hutch here

1379
01:16:18,975 --> 01:16:22,001
are watching him like a couple
of hawks... gay hawks.

1380
01:16:22,044 --> 01:16:25,207
- Yeah, right there, buddy.
- (chuckles)

1381
01:16:25,248 --> 01:16:28,217
All right, enough bullshit.
So you know our poetry boy?

1382
01:16:28,251 --> 01:16:30,242
Just talk to me.
What do you got for me?

1383
01:16:30,286 --> 01:16:32,345
- All right, here we go.
- Here we go.

1384
01:16:32,388 --> 01:16:33,855
Would you please?

1385
01:16:33,890 --> 01:16:36,723
Just 'cause the guy's talking tough,
that don't mean shit.

1386
01:16:36,759 --> 01:16:38,556
Let me ask you something,
Copernicus.

1387
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:41,188
That gun on his belt...
do you think it's a service pistol?

1388
01:16:41,230 --> 01:16:43,892
I bet you we'll trace it back to Trager's.
What do you think about that?

1389
01:16:43,933 --> 01:16:45,662
- What do you want to bet?
- 500 bucks.

1390
01:16:45,701 --> 01:16:47,828
- You're on.
- I'm in for another five.

1391
01:16:47,870 --> 01:16:50,236
Oh, this is fun.

1392
01:16:50,273 --> 01:16:52,468
Look, I help you,
you reciprocate.

1393
01:16:52,508 --> 01:16:53,975
So help me.

1394
01:16:54,010 --> 01:16:56,308
All right, you might see
a little bit of a cell-phone video.

1395
01:16:56,345 --> 01:16:58,404
I got it in front of Trager's
the night he bought it.

1396
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:00,381
- You got what?
- I got a movie...

1397
01:17:00,416 --> 01:17:03,908
a couple of kids back from the prom,
preserving their special memories,

1398
01:17:03,953 --> 01:17:05,648
a positive ID of you, big time.

1399
01:17:05,688 --> 01:17:07,849
- Oh, yeah? Of me?
- Yeah.

1400
01:17:07,890 --> 01:17:09,619
Okay.

1401
01:17:09,659 --> 01:17:11,183
Now you know
what I'm talking about.

1402
01:17:11,227 --> 01:17:13,593
Yeah, now I got it.

1403
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:15,563
Yeah, well,
so how do I look?

1404
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:20,192
Like a poet?

1405
01:17:21,204 --> 01:17:22,865
'Cause that's what I am,
you know, a poet.

1406
01:17:22,905 --> 01:17:25,601
All right, come on, let's go.

1407
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:28,269
In fact, I wrote a poem for you, Spider.
Want to hear it?

1408
01:17:28,311 --> 01:17:30,245
Eh?

1409
01:17:30,279 --> 01:17:32,509
(cocks gun)

1410
01:17:32,548 --> 01:17:34,072
(door crashes open)

1411
01:17:34,116 --> 01:17:37,608
Drop your gun right now, motherfucker!
Drop to the ground right now!

1412
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:39,484
Oh! Oh! Grease me up and...

1413
01:17:39,522 --> 01:17:41,581
I mean, do they actually pay
you two morons?

1414
01:17:41,624 --> 01:17:44,889
- Put the fucking weapon on the ground.
- Gladly. Gladly. Right there.

1415
01:17:44,927 --> 01:17:46,895
Right there. There you go.

1416
01:17:48,064 --> 01:17:49,964
Hey, you want to read my poem?

1417
01:17:49,999 --> 01:17:51,432
Easy easy.

1418
01:17:51,467 --> 01:17:52,764
Here, read it.

1419
01:17:54,937 --> 01:17:57,201
"You tried to set me up, you fucks,

1420
01:17:57,240 --> 01:17:59,037
And this is how you do it?

1421
01:17:59,075 --> 01:18:01,805
You thought I'd get
my dick cut off,

1422
01:18:01,844 --> 01:18:04,404
Instead you only blew it."

1423
01:18:04,447 --> 01:18:06,472
- (both laugh)
- Great stuff.

1424
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:08,881
- What is that shit?
- Thank you.

1425
01:18:08,918 --> 01:18:11,352
That is poetry.

1426
01:18:11,387 --> 01:18:13,116
What are you doing here?

1427
01:18:13,155 --> 01:18:14,986
Well, don't look at me, partner,

1428
01:18:15,024 --> 01:18:17,515
but I tagged along
to protect your ass

1429
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:20,893
and to see the look on their faces.
It was worth it.

1430
01:18:20,930 --> 01:18:23,296
We're doing our jobs here, okay?
I'm not gonna apologize for that.

1431
01:18:23,332 --> 01:18:25,960
I never want you to apologize, Teddy.
There's a killer out there with a badge.

1432
01:18:26,002 --> 01:18:28,163
- What are you morons doing about it?
- What do you think we're doing here?

1433
01:18:28,204 --> 01:18:30,069
- That's not it.
- No, that's not it.

1434
01:18:30,106 --> 01:18:32,006
I just made 1000 bucks.

1435
01:18:32,041 --> 01:18:33,906
Where's the other gun?
Give it to me.

1436
01:18:33,943 --> 01:18:35,740
Why don't you frisk me, Sherlock?
Go ahead.

1437
01:18:35,778 --> 01:18:37,973
- Frisk me, go ahead. Go ahead.
- Yeah, I'm gonna frisk you.

1438
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:43,712
Ooh, nice touch, Mary.

1439
01:18:43,753 --> 01:18:45,914
What are you doing after work?
Unless you're committed.

1440
01:18:45,955 --> 01:18:48,185
I don't want to get
in the middle of anything.

1441
01:18:48,224 --> 01:18:51,455
What happened to your face?
Your mick friend give you a little love bite?

1442
01:18:51,494 --> 01:18:54,861
- Shut the fuck up. Shut your fucking face.
- Hey hey hey! Whoa!

1443
01:18:54,897 --> 01:18:57,627
I'll blow your brains out
if you don't get the fuck away.

1444
01:18:57,667 --> 01:18:59,828
- What's he talking about?
- (all yelling)

1445
01:18:59,869 --> 01:19:01,666
- What's he talking about?
- What he's talking about is,

1446
01:19:01,704 --> 01:19:04,036
just 'cause you didn't go for this
doesn't mean you're not our guy.

1447
01:19:04,073 --> 01:19:06,439
- Now we gotta break this shit up.
- Don't translate for me, man.

1448
01:19:06,475 --> 01:19:09,103
Rooster: Will you let this go?
You fucked up, okay?

1449
01:19:09,145 --> 01:19:11,670
- We fucked up 'cause you helped him.
- I'm gonna nail your ass.

1450
01:19:11,714 --> 01:19:14,080
I'm not through with you, man.
Make a mistake.

1451
01:19:14,116 --> 01:19:16,107
Rooster: I'm gonna
break this stuff down, okay?

1452
01:19:16,152 --> 01:19:18,382
You fucking dog.

1453
01:19:19,922 --> 01:19:22,686
Relax, Spider.

1454
01:19:22,725 --> 01:19:25,057
Come on, let's have a drink.

1455
01:19:25,094 --> 01:19:28,655
I saw what I think
is a refrigerator here.

1456
01:19:32,868 --> 01:19:34,529
I'll be back in a second.

1457
01:19:43,479 --> 01:19:44,969
Hey, muffinhead.

1458
01:19:48,184 --> 01:19:49,651
Is this the person
who shot you?

1459
01:19:50,653 --> 01:19:52,587
You're sure?

1460
01:19:56,292 --> 01:19:58,283
(chuckles)

1461
01:19:58,327 --> 01:20:00,352
No, you're the pumpkinhead.

1462
01:20:05,701 --> 01:20:07,692
(Spider chuckling)

1463
01:20:11,607 --> 01:20:13,575
You miss me?

1464
01:20:15,611 --> 01:20:17,943
"...of death and pain,

1465
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:20,141
Place oneself among the slain.

1466
01:20:20,182 --> 01:20:22,707
If one addiction goes unfed,

1467
01:20:22,752 --> 01:20:25,050
The world is better with him dead."

1468
01:20:43,639 --> 01:20:44,867
Take it easy.

1469
01:20:44,907 --> 01:20:46,670
It's okay.
It's gonna be all right.

1470
01:20:46,709 --> 01:20:48,939
Jesus Christ, Rooster.

1471
01:20:48,978 --> 01:20:51,845
Just move into the room. Here.

1472
01:20:51,881 --> 01:20:54,349
Sit down. Sit down.

1473
01:20:57,253 --> 01:20:59,244
Okay.

1474
01:20:59,288 --> 01:21:02,985
You gotta know about this,
Tom, from me.

1475
01:21:03,025 --> 01:21:06,119
Now just open that little book,
start reading.

1476
01:21:06,162 --> 01:21:08,630
Everything you want to know
is in there.

1477
01:21:10,666 --> 01:21:12,657
So go ahead.

1478
01:21:14,236 --> 01:21:16,227
Out loud.

1479
01:21:17,573 --> 01:21:19,666
For the record.

1480
01:21:19,708 --> 01:21:22,472
See the little video here?

1481
01:21:28,884 --> 01:21:32,251
"My name is David Fisk,
Detective First Grade.

1482
01:21:32,288 --> 01:21:36,349
I've been a cop in the NYPD
for nearly 30 years."

1483
01:21:37,460 --> 01:21:40,987
- Dave, Dave, Dave, Dave.
- Tom,

1484
01:21:41,030 --> 01:21:44,124
we've got a lot to cover
and not much time to do it in, so...

1485
01:21:47,403 --> 01:21:50,600
"My name is David Fisk,
Detective First Grade."

1486
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:53,164
My name is David Fisk.

1487
01:21:53,209 --> 01:21:56,235
"I've been a cop in the NYPD
for nearly 30 years."

1488
01:21:56,278 --> 01:21:59,145
I don't expect you
to remember me.

1489
01:21:59,181 --> 01:22:01,206
I mean, it's been a long time

1490
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:05,050
since you sat me on your lap
and told me you loved me.

1491
01:22:05,087 --> 01:22:08,147
"In that time

1492
01:22:08,190 --> 01:22:10,920
I've killed 14 people."

1493
01:22:12,027 --> 01:22:14,018
Rooster: But I guarantee

1494
01:22:14,063 --> 01:22:17,226
you're gonna remember the name
for the rest of your life.

1495
01:22:27,743 --> 01:22:31,338
"You don't become a cop
because you want to serve and protect.

1496
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:35,841
You join the force because they let you
carry a gun and a badge.

1497
01:22:35,885 --> 01:22:38,547
Most people respect the badge.

1498
01:22:38,587 --> 01:22:40,680
Everybody respects the gun."

1499
01:22:40,723 --> 01:22:43,556
I'm the killer.
I show up at your door.

1500
01:22:43,592 --> 01:22:46,425
Turk: What are you talking about?
It's not a fucking chess game.

1501
01:22:46,462 --> 01:22:49,556
Who knows? Maybe it is.
You're making all the wrong moves.

1502
01:22:49,598 --> 01:22:51,793
I'm gonna put two
through his fucking head

1503
01:22:51,834 --> 01:22:54,166
myself.

1504
01:22:54,203 --> 01:22:56,364
I know it to a moral certainty.

1505
01:22:56,405 --> 01:22:58,930
You sort of get numb to it.

1506
01:23:08,484 --> 01:23:11,214
"Tom Cowen was my role model.

1507
01:23:21,297 --> 01:23:23,595
The day I stopped trying to be him

1508
01:23:23,632 --> 01:23:25,964
was the greatest day of my life.

1509
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:33,304
Several years back I framed
a lowlife child killer

1510
01:23:33,342 --> 01:23:36,004
named Charles Randall.

1511
01:23:37,780 --> 01:23:40,180
I should have known
it would come back to haunt me."

1512
01:23:44,386 --> 01:23:46,752
What do you want me
to do with this?

1513
01:23:48,557 --> 01:23:50,991
Is that all you got to say?

1514
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:53,256
I owe you this explanation, pal.

1515
01:23:53,295 --> 01:23:55,320
Why are you telling me now?

1516
01:23:55,364 --> 01:23:59,698
Ivan the Terrible
is gonna wake up pretty soon

1517
01:23:59,735 --> 01:24:01,532
and he's gonna ID me.

1518
01:24:07,109 --> 01:24:08,940
Evening, detective.

1519
01:24:08,978 --> 01:24:11,947
You want one? It's shit,
but it's better than nothing, right?

1520
01:24:11,981 --> 01:24:16,145
I can just walk right in here.
Your partner's asleep. Step outside.

1521
01:24:16,185 --> 01:24:19,018
Did I ever pick
the wrong fucking Russki to shoot?

1522
01:24:28,397 --> 01:24:30,797
Now we're going off the record.

1523
01:24:33,335 --> 01:24:37,135
Uh, I'm going to take the rap
for the Randall gun thing.

1524
01:24:37,172 --> 01:24:39,003
You saw that.

1525
01:24:39,041 --> 01:24:42,204
I mean, considering
the circumstances, why not?

1526
01:24:42,244 --> 01:24:44,712
No need to thank me.

1527
01:24:45,914 --> 01:24:47,848
That business about not being me...

1528
01:24:47,883 --> 01:24:49,373
Yeah.

1529
01:24:49,418 --> 01:24:51,386
I don't get that.

1530
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:55,413
Well, you're a great cop, Tom.

1531
01:24:55,457 --> 01:24:57,448
I mean, you were the one

1532
01:24:57,493 --> 01:25:00,553
I aspired to all my life
and could never be.

1533
01:25:02,131 --> 01:25:04,531
Then you broke the law,

1534
01:25:04,566 --> 01:25:07,729
planted the gun on Randall,

1535
01:25:07,770 --> 01:25:11,035
let me down.

1536
01:25:12,775 --> 01:25:14,709
I lost my faith.

1537
01:25:16,278 --> 01:25:20,237
That's when it all started.

1538
01:25:20,282 --> 01:25:22,944
And once it did,

1539
01:25:22,985 --> 01:25:25,010
I couldn't stop.

1540
01:25:26,388 --> 01:25:30,085
Finally,

1541
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:32,616
I didn't want to.

1542
01:25:39,034 --> 01:25:42,595
So I did my own thing.

1543
01:25:42,638 --> 01:25:45,232
And you know what? In the end

1544
01:25:45,274 --> 01:25:47,572
it got done.

1545
01:25:47,609 --> 01:25:50,134
The scum went down.

1546
01:25:50,179 --> 01:25:52,044
And that's it. That's that.

1547
01:25:53,582 --> 01:25:55,880
I don't understand
a word you said,

1548
01:25:55,918 --> 01:25:58,079
- don't understand any of it.
- I know you don't, Tom.

1549
01:25:58,120 --> 01:26:00,816
As soon as I heard
the Russian didn't die

1550
01:26:00,856 --> 01:26:03,222
I knew I had to change the rules,

1551
01:26:03,258 --> 01:26:06,091
do something that could
never be undone.

1552
01:26:06,128 --> 01:26:08,187
I went for the unforgivable.

1553
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:13,424
No.

1554
01:26:14,903 --> 01:26:17,167
So what am I gonna do, my friend,

1555
01:26:17,206 --> 01:26:19,834
partner? Arrest you?

1556
01:26:19,875 --> 01:26:22,742
At some point I gotta call it in.

1557
01:26:22,778 --> 01:26:24,177
We're a team.

1558
01:26:24,213 --> 01:26:25,908
We were.

1559
01:26:25,948 --> 01:26:27,939
Yeah, we were, a great team.

1560
01:26:27,983 --> 01:26:30,474
That was yesterday, Dave.

1561
01:26:30,519 --> 01:26:31,645
Today...

1562
01:26:33,756 --> 01:26:36,725
today you're pointing a gun at me.

1563
01:26:41,163 --> 01:26:44,291
(cocks gun)
But it hasn't gone off yet.

1564
01:26:49,671 --> 01:26:51,161
Bye, Tom.

1565
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:53,299
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.

1566
01:26:53,342 --> 01:26:56,345
To hell, I suppose.

1567
01:27:43,025 --> 01:27:45,050
- Hey, Dave, Dave.
- Whoa.

1568
01:27:45,093 --> 01:27:47,653
Don't come closer!

1569
01:27:47,696 --> 01:27:50,028
- You wouldn't.
- You want to bet your life on it?

1570
01:27:50,065 --> 01:27:52,033
Come on, partner, I know you.
You wouldn't.

1571
01:27:52,067 --> 01:27:54,433
(Karen cocks gun)
But I would.

1572
01:27:54,470 --> 01:27:55,698
Oh.

1573
01:27:55,737 --> 01:27:57,728
Karen, just take it easy.

1574
01:27:57,773 --> 01:27:59,798
- Can't get me out of your mind?
- Shut up, Dave.

1575
01:27:59,842 --> 01:28:03,869
You're gonna defend
this lowlife piece of shit?

1576
01:28:03,912 --> 01:28:06,847
- Boy, I'm in your head.
- I'm not defending him. Take it easy.

1577
01:28:06,882 --> 01:28:10,045
Fuck you, Turk.
Put the gun down, Fisk.

1578
01:28:10,085 --> 01:28:11,552
- And if I don't?
- Dave.

1579
01:28:11,587 --> 01:28:14,351
- How about I blow your brains out?
- Ooh, I like the sound of that.

1580
01:28:14,389 --> 01:28:16,323
- Don't move.
- Karen.

1581
01:28:16,358 --> 01:28:18,758
You blow me away, Turk dies.
Is that your idea?

1582
01:28:18,794 --> 01:28:20,125
I said don't move, you prick.

1583
01:28:20,162 --> 01:28:22,460
Bye-bye!

1584
01:28:24,132 --> 01:28:25,724
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun.

1585
01:28:27,402 --> 01:28:29,097
Stay here.

1586
01:28:35,878 --> 01:28:37,277
Oh, man.

1587
01:28:38,614 --> 01:28:39,876
Fuck.

1588
01:28:41,416 --> 01:28:43,316
- (train passing)
- These old locks...

1589
01:28:43,352 --> 01:28:45,047
I mean, they're good.

1590
01:28:45,087 --> 01:28:47,055
Dave, you've got to end
this thing.

1591
01:28:47,089 --> 01:28:49,148
End it?

1592
01:28:49,191 --> 01:28:50,488
Put the gun down.

1593
01:28:50,526 --> 01:28:53,324
What's your plan?

1594
01:28:53,362 --> 01:28:55,660
Are you gonna arrest me?

1595
01:28:55,697 --> 01:28:58,530
Are you gonna take me down
to the precinct, book me,

1596
01:28:58,567 --> 01:29:02,230
fingerprint me,
body-cavity-search me?

1597
01:29:02,271 --> 01:29:04,136
What the fuck
are you gonna do?

1598
01:29:04,172 --> 01:29:07,107
Wheel me out on the "Geraldo" show,
a freak of the week?

1599
01:29:07,142 --> 01:29:11,841
Or better yet, an in-depth
psycho profile on "Oprah"?

1600
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:14,178
Are you ready for that?
It ain't gonna fly, man.

1601
01:29:14,216 --> 01:29:16,582
Dave, you give me no choice.

1602
01:29:16,618 --> 01:29:18,449
You got a choice... I escape.

1603
01:29:20,022 --> 01:29:22,286
Would you do that for me, Tom?

1604
01:29:23,392 --> 01:29:24,620
Would you let me escape?

1605
01:29:24,660 --> 01:29:26,184
Come on, don't do this.

1606
01:29:26,228 --> 01:29:28,560
I'm gonna make a run for it.

1607
01:29:28,597 --> 01:29:30,792
What do you think?

1608
01:29:30,832 --> 01:29:33,824
You gotta do the right thing.

1609
01:29:39,841 --> 01:29:41,900
That's a 10-10, partner...

1610
01:29:41,944 --> 01:29:45,311
shots fired, suspect fleeing.
Let's go!

1611
01:29:45,347 --> 01:29:46,974
Come on, don't go there.

1612
01:29:48,483 --> 01:29:51,543
Hey, partner, come on.
Shots fired.

1613
01:29:51,587 --> 01:29:54,021
- Don't do this.
- Suspect fleeing,

1614
01:29:54,056 --> 01:29:56,490
resisting arrest. Come on.

1615
01:30:05,901 --> 01:30:08,802
A righteous man

1616
01:30:08,837 --> 01:30:11,567
Before me stands,

1617
01:30:11,607 --> 01:30:15,976
A hero in these filthy lands.

1618
01:30:16,011 --> 01:30:19,412
A brother in arms,

1619
01:30:19,448 --> 01:30:22,906
In heart are you.

1620
01:30:22,951 --> 01:30:25,613
I was really hoping

1621
01:30:25,654 --> 01:30:28,316
You'd get it too.

1622
01:30:31,793 --> 01:30:34,353
- I do get it.
- No, you don't.

1623
01:30:34,396 --> 01:30:36,330
No, I get it.

1624
01:30:42,671 --> 01:30:45,936
You know, the only thing
in this life

1625
01:30:45,974 --> 01:30:48,807
that ever gave me
any satisfaction

1626
01:30:48,844 --> 01:30:50,744
was killing those fucks.

1627
01:30:52,681 --> 01:30:55,013
So this is for real.

1628
01:30:55,050 --> 01:30:57,416
I mean,

1629
01:30:57,452 --> 01:30:59,784
this one is bad.

1630
01:31:01,957 --> 01:31:03,584
10-13.

1631
01:31:04,593 --> 01:31:06,788
Officer down.

1632
01:31:06,828 --> 01:31:09,695
(train passing)

1633
01:31:30,419 --> 01:31:33,479
I ain't going anywhere, Tom.

1634
01:31:33,522 --> 01:31:35,820
I ain't going anywhere.

1635
01:31:36,958 --> 01:31:39,791
It's okay.

1636
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:47,830
3-4 squad, Central.
3-4 squad, Central.

1637
01:31:47,869 --> 01:31:50,360
10-13, officer down.
184th and St. Nick's.

1638
01:31:50,405 --> 01:31:53,135
Officer down, 10-13.
Hurry hurry hurry.

1639
01:31:53,175 --> 01:31:55,837
- Dispatcher: 10-4, 4 squad...
- Tom, don't. Don't.

1640
01:31:55,877 --> 01:31:59,438
- Officer down. ETA six minutes.
- Don't.

1641
01:31:59,481 --> 01:32:02,109
Don't.

1642
01:32:14,329 --> 01:32:16,354
Don't.

1643
01:32:24,806 --> 01:32:26,899
3-4 squad, Central.

1644
01:32:26,942 --> 01:32:29,536
Dispatcher: Central.
Go ahead, 4 squad.

1645
01:32:29,578 --> 01:32:32,103
That's a 10-55 on the bus.
Cancel the ambulance.

1646
01:32:32,147 --> 01:32:34,138
Dispatcher: 10-5?

1647
01:32:34,182 --> 01:32:37,242
Turk: Cancel the ambulance.
10-55 on the bus. Cancel the ambulance.

1648
01:32:37,285 --> 01:32:39,947
- You sure on that?
- Sure on that.

1649
01:32:49,097 --> 01:32:51,463
You did this, you know.

1650
01:32:53,034 --> 01:32:56,492
I know, partner, I know.

1651
01:32:59,641 --> 01:33:01,472
We did good, Tom.

1652
01:33:02,711 --> 01:33:05,145
Tom, Tommy.

1653
01:33:05,180 --> 01:33:08,911
We did good. We did good.

1654
01:33:10,619 --> 01:33:13,349
You're a good man, Tom.

1655
01:33:13,388 --> 01:33:15,822
You're a good man.

1656
01:33:17,192 --> 01:33:20,218
I wish you...

1657
01:33:20,262 --> 01:33:22,560
I wish you

1658
01:33:22,597 --> 01:33:25,691
continued success.

1659
01:34:07,409 --> 01:34:09,570
Some piece of work, your partner.

1660
01:34:09,611 --> 01:34:11,602
Lights.

1661
01:34:11,646 --> 01:34:13,443
Look, Cowen,

1662
01:34:13,481 --> 01:34:16,143
the way we see it,

1663
01:34:16,184 --> 01:34:19,153
Detective Fisk just closed the door
on the poetry boy.

1664
01:34:26,094 --> 01:34:29,257
Good. Whatever you say.

1665
01:34:32,100 --> 01:34:34,568
Are we done?

1666
01:34:34,603 --> 01:34:36,628
Yeah, we're done.

1667
01:34:42,477 --> 01:34:44,638
(children playing)

1668
01:34:58,727 --> 01:35:00,558
Turk's voice: My daughter called.

1669
01:35:00,595 --> 01:35:04,258
She was upset about Rooster
and worried about me.

1670
01:35:04,299 --> 01:35:07,860
She asked me if I was likely
to do something stupid

1671
01:35:07,903 --> 01:35:10,463
and I said, "Like what,

1672
01:35:10,505 --> 01:35:13,531
take anger management classes
or retire?"

1673
01:35:13,575 --> 01:35:16,840
I said I was gonna do
the same old thing I always do.

1674
01:35:16,878 --> 01:35:20,780
She said, "Good.
What else could you do?"

1675
01:35:20,815 --> 01:35:22,476
I said, "Right."

1676
01:35:22,517 --> 01:35:25,543
A real chip off the old block,
my daughter.

1677
01:35:25,587 --> 01:35:28,818
She said I was a cop
and a good one.

1678
01:35:28,857 --> 01:35:32,418
Funny... Rooster said
the same thing.

1679
01:35:35,530 --> 01:35:38,795
Turk: Okay, guys,
let's get ready to play ball.

1680
01:35:38,833 --> 01:35:42,667
On the count of three.
Everybody in?

1681
01:35:42,704 --> 01:35:46,265
One, two, three, explosion!

1682
01:35:58,954 --> 01:36:00,951
(instrumental music playing)
