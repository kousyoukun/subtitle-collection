1
00:01:21,434 --> 00:01:22,726
One

2
00:01:22,768 --> 00:01:24,228
between the eyes!

3
00:01:24,269 --> 00:01:26,396
Two

4
00:01:26,438 --> 00:01:28,523
between the eyes.

5
00:01:57,467 --> 00:01:59,302
- Out!
- What?

6
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,640
- She was safe.
- She was out.

7
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,600
She landed right there.
She's safe.

8
00:02:09,227 --> 00:02:10,896
Turk: Aw, come on.

9
00:02:10,937 --> 00:02:13,606
Umpire: That's enough.
I don't want to hear another word.

10
00:02:13,648 --> 00:02:15,900
- You're gone!
- Yeah, I'm gone.

11
00:02:23,407 --> 00:02:26,451
My grandmother used to take me
to Washington Square Park...

12
00:02:28,286 --> 00:02:30,747
to watch Bobby Fischer
play 10 games at the same time.

13
00:02:30,789 --> 00:02:32,832
Queen me.

14
00:02:32,874 --> 00:02:35,835
He was five-six moves ahead
on each table.

15
00:02:36,836 --> 00:02:39,297
Anyway, he became
the world champ, didn't he?

16
00:02:39,338 --> 00:02:41,382
Then he lost his fucking mind.

17
00:02:44,718 --> 00:02:47,346
He became a raving paranoid.

18
00:02:47,387 --> 00:02:49,139
Being attacked
from all directions,

19
00:02:49,181 --> 00:02:51,182
he couldn't see
what was in front of him.

20
00:02:58,314 --> 00:03:00,524
Mate. Mate!

21
00:03:20,418 --> 00:03:23,003
(both laugh)

22
00:03:30,886 --> 00:03:33,388
My name is david Fisk,

23
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,598
detective First Grade.

24
00:03:36,808 --> 00:03:39,685
I've been a cop in the NYPd
for over 30 years.

25
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,355
In that time...

26
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,442
I've killed 14 people.

27
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:51,321
Man: Run that by me
one more time.

28
00:03:52,322 --> 00:03:54,908
I've killed 14 people.

29
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:56,576
He's nuts.

30
00:03:59,078 --> 00:04:01,288
Turk's voice: When did
these things start?

31
00:04:05,417 --> 00:04:07,586
How did they start?

32
00:04:12,674 --> 00:04:15,969
Maybe this one started
with a guy named Charles Randall.

33
00:04:21,557 --> 00:04:24,476
Randall was a child killer.

34
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,647
He killed his girlfriend's daughter

35
00:04:28,689 --> 00:04:31,107
about four years ago.

36
00:04:32,442 --> 00:04:34,444
Randall: Fuck you, damn asshole.

37
00:04:35,737 --> 00:04:37,363
Turk's voice: He was tried
for the crime,

38
00:04:37,405 --> 00:04:39,865
but was acquitted
by a jury of his peers.

39
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:57,507
My partner and I
found this unacceptable.

40
00:05:01,302 --> 00:05:04,263
My partner is a good man.

41
00:05:25,282 --> 00:05:27,868
Are you really
gonna do this thing?

42
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:29,953
Do what?

43
00:05:29,995 --> 00:05:32,414
You're going to
take down Randall

44
00:05:32,455 --> 00:05:34,624
for a homicide
he didn't commit.

45
00:05:39,503 --> 00:05:41,839
What am I gonna do?

46
00:05:41,881 --> 00:05:43,882
You're my partner.

47
00:05:43,924 --> 00:05:46,301
- You're my role model.
- Right.

48
00:05:46,343 --> 00:05:48,345
What am I gonna do
without a role model?

49
00:05:51,765 --> 00:05:54,559
We didn't have
this conversation.

50
00:05:54,601 --> 00:05:57,061
What conversation?

51
00:06:16,204 --> 00:06:17,955
Turk's voice: It got done.

52
00:06:22,251 --> 00:06:25,295
Randall lost his freedom

53
00:06:25,337 --> 00:06:27,339
for the crime he didn't commit.

54
00:06:33,178 --> 00:06:35,263
Turk's voice: I lost my faith.

55
00:06:37,932 --> 00:06:40,476
- I'm gonna go.
- Okay.

56
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:50,569
You can take this
as a confession if you want.

57
00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:53,530
You can take this
as a confession if you want.

58
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:55,531
Whatever.

59
00:06:55,573 --> 00:06:58,367
A few weeks ago
things heated up.

60
00:06:58,409 --> 00:07:00,161
What do we got on him, Turk?

61
00:07:00,202 --> 00:07:04,623
Marcus Smith, AKA Spider...
big big dope deals,

62
00:07:04,665 --> 00:07:07,084
murders, extortion,
lots of nice things.

63
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:09,461
He converted
this old abandoned bank

64
00:07:09,503 --> 00:07:11,630
into Club 404 of Harlem.

65
00:07:11,671 --> 00:07:13,298
Maybe when he sees us
he'll confess.

66
00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:15,300
What, you don't believe
in miracles?

67
00:07:15,341 --> 00:07:16,926
When you pick up a check
one day...

68
00:07:16,968 --> 00:07:19,303
one day,
then I'll believe in miracles.

69
00:07:19,345 --> 00:07:22,473
- Let's go. I'm buying.
- Yeah, that's a miracle I want to see.

70
00:07:22,515 --> 00:07:25,350
(crowd chattering,
distant music playing)

71
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,146
(hip-hop music playing)
#We fly high, no lie #

72
00:07:29,187 --> 00:07:32,148
#You hear that?
You know this, balling #

73
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:35,151
#Foreign rides outside #

74
00:07:35,193 --> 00:07:37,236
#It's like showbiz,
we in the building #

75
00:07:37,278 --> 00:07:39,488
#We stay fly, no lie... #

76
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,282
Turk: This is where he launders
his money.

77
00:07:41,323 --> 00:07:45,285
Rooster: Oh, yeah,
cleaning green green green.

78
00:07:45,327 --> 00:07:47,537
Turk: He's all business.

79
00:07:48,955 --> 00:07:50,749
I gotta take a leak.

80
00:08:00,508 --> 00:08:02,676
Oh, I'll just be a sec.

81
00:08:02,718 --> 00:08:04,178
I'm not peeking.

82
00:08:04,219 --> 00:08:06,597
No problem.

83
00:08:11,142 --> 00:08:13,686
- You guys are so lucky.
- Why is that?

84
00:08:13,728 --> 00:08:16,022
No line to the bathroom and...

85
00:08:16,064 --> 00:08:17,940
(sniffs)

86
00:08:17,982 --> 00:08:20,192
You get to pee standing up.

87
00:08:20,234 --> 00:08:22,069
Unzip, psss, zip.

88
00:08:22,111 --> 00:08:24,363
Badda boom badda bing,
you're out of here.

89
00:08:24,405 --> 00:08:28,825
Yeah, the big guy really outdid himself
on this thing.

90
00:08:28,825 --> 00:08:30,202
You want a bump?

91
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:32,162
Where did you get that from?

92
00:08:32,203 --> 00:08:34,664
Spider. Supremo.

93
00:08:38,834 --> 00:08:41,295
(train whistle blows)

94
00:09:03,857 --> 00:09:05,818
(door closes)

95
00:09:18,788 --> 00:09:20,790
(muffled screams)

96
00:09:20,831 --> 00:09:23,334
(crash, thumping)

97
00:09:36,054 --> 00:09:38,055
(sighs)

98
00:09:43,102 --> 00:09:45,062
Not bad.

99
00:09:45,104 --> 00:09:48,398
Turk: Not bad?
What the fuck were you looking for?

100
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,817
Come on, Turk,

101
00:09:50,859 --> 00:09:52,861
you pulled my hair.

102
00:09:52,902 --> 00:09:56,072
Gee, my little sister used to
pull my hair harder than that.

103
00:09:56,114 --> 00:09:57,323
Whatever.

104
00:10:01,494 --> 00:10:03,579
I gotta go.

105
00:10:14,756 --> 00:10:17,049
- Where the fuck are you going?
- I'm tired.

106
00:10:17,091 --> 00:10:19,760
You're tired?
It's America, you whiny bitch.

107
00:10:19,802 --> 00:10:22,638
Why don't you fucking get in the cab
and do some honest work?

108
00:10:22,638 --> 00:10:25,516
Yeah, she's on her way.
She can't wait to see you.

109
00:10:25,557 --> 00:10:28,810
Rambo the Skateboard Pimp
was my 10th kill.

110
00:10:30,979 --> 00:10:34,649
- (muffled gunshot)
- Think of me as a street-sweeper.

111
00:10:34,691 --> 00:10:36,776
I cleaned up this worthless
piece of shit

112
00:10:36,818 --> 00:10:39,862
and left an obituary of sorts.
It rhymes.

113
00:10:48,745 --> 00:10:51,122
Rooster, we gotta find out
who did this.

114
00:10:51,164 --> 00:10:52,999
Give him a medal.

115
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:55,877
Hey, Rambo, you see
who did this?

116
00:10:55,918 --> 00:10:57,879
He ain't talking, eh?

117
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,131
Real name Robert Brady.

118
00:11:00,172 --> 00:11:02,132
Bobby Brady. Damn shame.

119
00:11:02,174 --> 00:11:04,009
What are you thinking?
Marcia? Greg?

120
00:11:04,051 --> 00:11:05,511
(both chuckle)

121
00:11:05,552 --> 00:11:07,512
You guys messing up
my crime scene again?

122
00:11:07,554 --> 00:11:09,681
You don't know
who Bobby Brady is?

123
00:11:09,723 --> 00:11:11,725
Yeah, we met about an hour ago.

124
00:11:11,766 --> 00:11:14,519
- It looks like close range.
- From the stippling around the wound

125
00:11:14,561 --> 00:11:16,187
I'd say two to three feet away.

126
00:11:16,229 --> 00:11:18,981
We'll be fishing fragments
out of his brains.

127
00:11:19,023 --> 00:11:21,067
- What?
- No, I just got that...

128
00:11:21,108 --> 00:11:23,193
"Marcia? Greg?"
That's a good one, Rooster.

129
00:11:23,235 --> 00:11:24,987
Well, that was quick.

130
00:11:25,028 --> 00:11:26,863
Just trying to keep pace with you.

131
00:11:31,034 --> 00:11:34,162
Turk: "He trades in sin,
distributes flesh.

132
00:11:34,204 --> 00:11:36,581
He picks the fruit
when it is fresh.

133
00:11:36,581 --> 00:11:39,709
Now someone else
must slap his whore.

134
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:44,505
His heart has stopped.
He breathes no more."

135
00:11:46,381 --> 00:11:48,383
What do you want to do
about this?

136
00:11:48,425 --> 00:11:51,219
I say let's make the best of it,

137
00:11:51,261 --> 00:11:54,389
canvass the hookers.
Maybe we'll meet one you like.

138
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:58,059
Please. I got all I can handle
from you-know-who.

139
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,935
No shit?

140
00:11:59,935 --> 00:12:03,063
She's got my sperm level so low
I gotta sit down to take a piss.

141
00:12:03,105 --> 00:12:04,732
Oh, thanks for that picture.

142
00:12:04,773 --> 00:12:07,067
- Hey, what can I tell you?
- (laughs)

143
00:12:07,109 --> 00:12:09,861
(Russian accent)
How can I help you, gentlemen?

144
00:12:09,903 --> 00:12:11,905
We'd like to talk to you
about your boss.

145
00:12:11,946 --> 00:12:14,240
He's upstairs.

146
00:12:14,282 --> 00:12:16,617
No, your other boss.

147
00:12:20,413 --> 00:12:22,414
Rambo.

148
00:12:22,456 --> 00:12:24,375
He is asshole.

149
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:27,586
Why "he is asshole"?

150
00:12:27,628 --> 00:12:30,005
Follow me, please.

151
00:12:34,801 --> 00:12:36,427
You know anybody
who'd want to kill him?

152
00:12:36,469 --> 00:12:38,137
Me.

153
00:12:38,137 --> 00:12:39,472
Anyone else?

154
00:12:39,472 --> 00:12:41,474
Why? He's dead?

155
00:12:41,515 --> 00:12:43,183
(chuckles)

156
00:12:43,225 --> 00:12:45,769
Hey, listen, you want to smarten up
and help us out

157
00:12:45,811 --> 00:12:47,479
or am I gonna have to call
somebody at ICE

158
00:12:47,521 --> 00:12:49,314
and have you on the next plane
to kielbasa-land?

159
00:12:49,356 --> 00:12:51,149
Go ahead.

160
00:12:51,191 --> 00:12:53,109
I am American citizen.

161
00:12:53,151 --> 00:12:55,194
Yeah.

162
00:12:55,236 --> 00:12:57,280
Lick my balls anytime.

163
00:12:57,363 --> 00:12:58,948
What?

164
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,950
Call us anytime, you know,

165
00:13:01,033 --> 00:13:03,410
if you hear something, anything.

166
00:13:05,788 --> 00:13:08,623
Rooster: I think we're looking
for a guy named Sam the Butcher.

167
00:13:08,665 --> 00:13:11,126
- Who?
- (laughs)

168
00:13:11,167 --> 00:13:13,419
Nah, he's kidding around.
But seriously, Lieutenant,

169
00:13:13,461 --> 00:13:15,505
how far do you want us to go
with this Rambo murder?

170
00:13:15,546 --> 00:13:18,007
I don't know, I was thinking maybe
you could investigate it a bit more,

171
00:13:18,049 --> 00:13:20,426
figure out who did it,
try to put him in jail.

172
00:13:20,468 --> 00:13:23,345
That is, if it doesn't get in the way
of your shuffleboard lessons.

173
00:13:23,387 --> 00:13:24,888
Yeah, no problem.

174
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,808
We're also working this dealer Spider
who's tied to these two stiffs

175
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:29,142
we found on Fresh Kills.

176
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:35,356
If we can nail him, who knows
how far up the ladder it will lead?

177
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:36,524
So what about it?

178
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,234
I popped this lawyer
with an ounce of blow.

179
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:40,653
She practically shoved it up my nose.
I got her to flip on him.

180
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,363
Lucky fuck, eh?

181
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:44,031
She scored it from him directly?

182
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,366
- Yeah, she did.
- Good.

183
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:50,078
Okay, well, get what you can out of her
and kick her loose.

184
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,580
I hate trying to prosecute
fucking lawyers.

185
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:55,416
(trains passing)

186
00:14:01,297 --> 00:14:03,549
- This isn't Spider's club.
- The back way in.

187
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:07,594
Rooster: Yeah, it's an abandoned
linen factory, Jessica.

188
00:14:07,636 --> 00:14:10,597
I guess I'm not your average...

189
00:14:10,597 --> 00:14:12,098
what do you call it?

190
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,142
- Rat?
- Stoolie?

191
00:14:14,184 --> 00:14:16,185
Thanks.

192
00:14:16,227 --> 00:14:19,939
I mean, I think usually
it's some poor African-American kid

193
00:14:19,939 --> 00:14:22,191
or a junkie or a prostitute.

194
00:14:22,233 --> 00:14:24,777
Well, normally 200-grand-a-year
corporate lawyers

195
00:14:24,818 --> 00:14:27,779
are much smarter than your average
African-American junkie whore...

196
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:30,448
normally, but sometimes
they only think they are.

197
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:33,326
Man over radio: It's all set
on this end.

198
00:14:33,368 --> 00:14:35,036
Are you guys sure
it's safe in there?

199
00:14:35,078 --> 00:14:38,122
Man: You tell your girlfriend
to grow a pair and let's go.

200
00:14:38,164 --> 00:14:41,250
What do you say, Counsel?
Are you ready to do this thing?

201
00:14:41,292 --> 00:14:43,961
Yeah, let's get it over with.

202
00:14:44,003 --> 00:14:46,964
Okay, remember what we said?
You go in there,

203
00:14:47,005 --> 00:14:50,383
you wait for him to ask you
for what you need, right?

204
00:14:50,425 --> 00:14:53,052
And then you don't come back here
with less than four ounces.

205
00:14:53,094 --> 00:14:54,554
- Four ounces?
- Yeah.

206
00:14:54,596 --> 00:14:57,265
Isn't that a lot? I, like, buy a couple
of balls at the club, that's it.

207
00:14:57,306 --> 00:15:00,267
You just say you're going skiing and
you need a week's worth of fresh powder.

208
00:15:00,309 --> 00:15:02,645
Yeah, you tell him you're going
on vacation.

209
00:15:05,522 --> 00:15:09,276
I do this thing
and my record's wiped clean?

210
00:15:09,317 --> 00:15:10,610
As a whistle.

211
00:15:10,652 --> 00:15:12,612
No one at my law firm will know
that I got busted, right?

212
00:15:12,654 --> 00:15:14,155
It never happened.

213
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:17,575
Look, Counsel, we all know you
better than this.

214
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:20,202
You just do this, you stop
shoving that shit up your nose,

215
00:15:20,244 --> 00:15:21,996
you go home, you get married,
you have kids,

216
00:15:22,037 --> 00:15:24,707
you never come back here,
and that's that.

217
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,543
Yeah.

218
00:15:28,585 --> 00:15:31,421
Officer: Everybody's in position.

219
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:33,923
- Turk: Okay, we're going.
- Officer: Yes, sir.

220
00:15:36,217 --> 00:15:38,886
Officer: Let's push the signal
back 50%.

221
00:15:39,887 --> 00:15:41,931
Rooster: Hey, Jessica.

222
00:15:41,972 --> 00:15:43,432
Break a leg.

223
00:15:43,474 --> 00:15:46,143
(radio chatter)

224
00:15:46,185 --> 00:15:48,186
It's two flights down.

225
00:15:48,228 --> 00:15:50,564
The door's on the left.
Ring the bell.

226
00:15:56,069 --> 00:15:57,570
(rings doorbell)

227
00:15:57,612 --> 00:16:00,072
Hey, Stubby, why don't you
go and escort our company up here?

228
00:16:01,907 --> 00:16:03,909
Go on, fat boy.

229
00:16:07,788 --> 00:16:09,331
Get it on.

230
00:16:16,963 --> 00:16:19,632
- Good afternoon.
- Hey, Spider.

231
00:16:19,674 --> 00:16:22,176
- I'll be downstairs.
- All right.

232
00:16:22,218 --> 00:16:24,219
- How are you?
- All right, baby,

233
00:16:24,303 --> 00:16:26,638
just checking out this wizard shit
before I let my kids watch it.

234
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,141
- You seen this?
- No.

235
00:16:29,182 --> 00:16:31,643
The guy is a stone dealer.
I let my little ones watch this...

236
00:16:31,685 --> 00:16:33,937
they'll all turn out junkies.
You know what I'm saying?

237
00:16:33,978 --> 00:16:35,480
He's got a point.

238
00:16:35,521 --> 00:16:37,732
- You remember Underdog?
- What about him?

239
00:16:37,773 --> 00:16:40,693
That fucking dog spawned
a generation of junkies.

240
00:16:40,735 --> 00:16:44,571
So you converted the bank
into a club and a recording studio?

241
00:16:44,613 --> 00:16:47,157
- Yeah. You like it?
- Yeah.

242
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,117
What are you talking about?

243
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:50,869
What did Underdog do
all the time?

244
00:16:50,911 --> 00:16:52,620
He was always shining shoes

245
00:16:52,662 --> 00:16:54,789
and whenever Sweet Polly Purebred
would call out to him,

246
00:16:54,831 --> 00:16:56,833
his dog ears would pick it up
and he'd rescue her.

247
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:59,335
Yeah, but what did he do
when he needed his super strength?

248
00:16:59,335 --> 00:17:01,504
He'd go to his ring, remember?

249
00:17:01,545 --> 00:17:03,422
Pull out a pill, pop it.

250
00:17:03,464 --> 00:17:06,967
Holy shit, you're right.
He was a little fucking speed freak.

251
00:17:07,009 --> 00:17:08,343
Spider: So what's the business?

252
00:17:08,343 --> 00:17:11,179
How about a QP?
You're good for a QP.

253
00:17:11,221 --> 00:17:12,889
The fuck you want with QP?

254
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:15,558
I'm going skiing with friends,

255
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,144
a lot of friends.

256
00:17:18,186 --> 00:17:20,646
- Where?
- Aspen, Colorado.

257
00:17:20,688 --> 00:17:23,399
Shit. I'm sure you can
score one in Aspen.

258
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,442
Not your primo brand.

259
00:17:26,443 --> 00:17:27,861
You ski?

260
00:17:27,903 --> 00:17:29,404
Sure. My whole life.

261
00:17:29,446 --> 00:17:32,574
Come on, I don't have all day.

262
00:17:32,615 --> 00:17:34,951
Why don't you put down your jacket,
stay a little while?

263
00:17:34,993 --> 00:17:36,160
What do you think?

264
00:17:36,202 --> 00:17:37,787
Jessica: Actually,
I've got to run.

265
00:17:37,829 --> 00:17:41,707
I have a major IPO
closing in an hour, so...

266
00:17:41,749 --> 00:17:44,501
You know, stress will kill you.
You gotta chill out.

267
00:17:45,878 --> 00:17:47,796
I'm as chill as I get.

268
00:17:47,838 --> 00:17:49,840
What do you want to do?

269
00:17:53,176 --> 00:17:55,553
You know, every once in a while...

270
00:17:57,763 --> 00:17:59,807
one of you Upper East Side bitches
gets popped,

271
00:17:59,849 --> 00:18:01,851
tries to to roll over
on a nigga like me.

272
00:18:01,892 --> 00:18:03,978
You're scared now.

273
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:07,189
(doorbell ringing)

274
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:11,234
Looks like the cavalry
come to rescue you.

275
00:18:11,276 --> 00:18:12,777
Can I help you, gentlemen?

276
00:18:12,819 --> 00:18:14,279
Yeah, let us in, Spider.

277
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:16,489
I'm sorry, there's no one here
by that name.

278
00:18:16,531 --> 00:18:19,450
- Let us in.
- We only want to talk to you.

279
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:22,077
(door buzzes)

280
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:25,038
See, I know how to look
and I know where to look.

281
00:18:30,961 --> 00:18:32,962
Come to papa.

282
00:18:34,631 --> 00:18:36,299
It always hurts the first time.

283
00:18:37,633 --> 00:18:38,926
Turk: You all right?

284
00:18:38,968 --> 00:18:40,761
Why wouldn't she be all right?
We're watching TV.

285
00:18:40,803 --> 00:18:42,471
How the fuck is she gonna get hurt
watching TV?

286
00:18:42,513 --> 00:18:45,099
She could have seen or heard
something that scared her.

287
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,059
- Like what?
- Like some big fucking mutt

288
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,602
shooting his bug fat
fucking mouth off.

289
00:18:48,643 --> 00:18:51,521
Wasn't nobody here fitting that description
till a minute ago.

290
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:53,481
I'm gonna show you ugly,
you fucking mother...

291
00:18:53,481 --> 00:18:55,984
- We've said enough.
- Oh, you finna bring your wife up in here?

292
00:18:55,984 --> 00:18:59,070
That's it. That's it.
Let's go. It's okay.

293
00:18:59,111 --> 00:19:01,822
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.

294
00:19:01,864 --> 00:19:03,824
You want your wire back?

295
00:19:05,451 --> 00:19:07,327
Firearm!

296
00:19:07,327 --> 00:19:08,453
No, Stubby, no!

297
00:19:17,211 --> 00:19:19,046
Get down.
Get the fuck down!

298
00:19:28,847 --> 00:19:30,307
Turk: Come on.

299
00:19:30,348 --> 00:19:33,143
The fat one's dead.

300
00:19:34,561 --> 00:19:37,355
(Jessica moaning)

301
00:19:42,234 --> 00:19:43,652
Well, that went well.

302
00:19:45,529 --> 00:19:47,406
Oh, shit, you're bleeding.

303
00:19:48,407 --> 00:19:51,534
3-4 squad, Central.
11-41, request ambulance.

304
00:19:51,576 --> 00:19:54,370
I need EMS. Subject shot,
184th and St. Nicholas.

305
00:19:54,412 --> 00:19:56,581
Really, I tried my best.

306
00:19:56,622 --> 00:19:59,917
You're doing just fine, Counsel.
You're doing just fine. Just relax.

307
00:19:59,959 --> 00:20:03,045
Hey, guys, if you ever
need a lawyer...

308
00:20:03,087 --> 00:20:05,839
Yeah, okay.

309
00:20:05,881 --> 00:20:08,341
You bet.

310
00:20:11,094 --> 00:20:13,304
In good old days
we used to

311
00:20:13,346 --> 00:20:16,057
let the perp bleed out
and call off the ambulance.

312
00:20:16,099 --> 00:20:18,059
- Calm calm calm.
- Fucking lowlife.

313
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,894
You made your point.
You made your point.

314
00:20:19,935 --> 00:20:22,229
Tough little bitch, ain't you,
kicking a man while he's handcuffed?

315
00:20:22,271 --> 00:20:24,732
Shut the fuck up,
you piece of shit.

316
00:20:24,773 --> 00:20:26,400
You think I won't blow
your fucking head off?

317
00:20:26,441 --> 00:20:28,235
I wouldn't think twice
about it.

318
00:20:28,276 --> 00:20:30,529
I'd go in there,
get the fat boy's gun,

319
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:34,240
come back here
and put two between your eyes.

320
00:20:34,282 --> 00:20:36,200
(rapid footsteps)

321
00:20:39,036 --> 00:20:41,038
Where's EMS?

322
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,249
Woman: This thing was a clusterfuck
to end all clusterfucks.

323
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:45,876
You got nothing.

324
00:20:45,918 --> 00:20:47,878
How about felony murder?

325
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,422
No drugs, right?
So no predicate felony,

326
00:20:50,463 --> 00:20:52,340
no conspiracy,
no nothing.

327
00:20:52,382 --> 00:20:54,425
No felony. No felony.
I can't believe this.

328
00:20:54,467 --> 00:20:56,177
No felony.
How do you spell felony?

329
00:20:56,219 --> 00:20:59,555
Homicide, racketeering, drugs...
I mean, what are we talking about?

330
00:20:59,597 --> 00:21:02,224
Hey, you're lucky
that white girl didn't die.

331
00:21:02,266 --> 00:21:04,143
IAB is gonna interview
both of you

332
00:21:04,184 --> 00:21:06,645
and do a preliminary report
over the next couple of weeks.

333
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:10,190
Now off the record
you actually didn't violate procedure

334
00:21:10,232 --> 00:21:12,650
because the victim had a firearm
aimed at you,

335
00:21:12,692 --> 00:21:14,944
so if you stick together
you should make it through this.

336
00:21:14,986 --> 00:21:16,946
Lieutenant: You'd better get
your story straight too,

337
00:21:17,029 --> 00:21:19,824
'cause I'm not going back to Far Rockaway
because you two fucked up.

338
00:21:19,865 --> 00:21:22,493
And you're gonna spend some couch time
with the rubber-gun squad.

339
00:21:22,535 --> 00:21:26,330
And you'd better take this shrink seriously
or you'll be off active duty.

340
00:21:26,371 --> 00:21:28,123
That fucking piece of shit
just walks.

341
00:21:28,165 --> 00:21:29,958
Knock it off, Turk.

342
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,088
Relax, partner.
He's gonna get his.

343
00:21:35,129 --> 00:21:37,632
Man: Gentlemen, your questions.

344
00:21:37,715 --> 00:21:40,092
- Who made the decision to enter?
- I did.

345
00:21:40,134 --> 00:21:42,136
- Whose decision was it to enter?
- Mine.

346
00:21:42,178 --> 00:21:44,471
Did you immediately identify yourselves
as police officers?

347
00:21:44,513 --> 00:21:46,807
- Yes, we did.
- Did you immediately identify yourselves?

348
00:21:46,848 --> 00:21:49,351
The informant's position
was becoming untenable.

349
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:51,645
- We were afraid she was in danger.
- Turns out you were right.

350
00:21:51,686 --> 00:21:54,189
- No fucking kidding, nine-to-fiver.
- Excuse me, detective?

351
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,607
Are you finished
with my client?

352
00:21:58,568 --> 00:22:02,530
- They're like Lennon and McCartney.
- Not an inch of daylight between them.

353
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:03,822
What do you think?

354
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,157
Nothing there.

355
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:08,076
They endangered the informant.
We can't make them wrong on that.

356
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:09,703
They saw a gun, they reacted.

357
00:22:09,744 --> 00:22:11,538
They beat the fuck
out of the suspect,

358
00:22:11,579 --> 00:22:13,665
but he's not filing charges.

359
00:22:13,706 --> 00:22:15,750
Let's see what the shrink says.

360
00:22:16,751 --> 00:22:19,170
So what are we gonna
do now, doc?

361
00:22:19,211 --> 00:22:21,380
Are we gonna find out
if I'm sane enough

362
00:22:21,422 --> 00:22:24,174
to carry a gun,
chase bad guys?

363
00:22:24,216 --> 00:22:26,802
Okay, why did you become a cop?

364
00:22:26,843 --> 00:22:29,596
Well, it was New Year's Eve.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

365
00:22:29,596 --> 00:22:33,516
I didn't have the same opportunities
you had, dr. Prosky.

366
00:22:33,558 --> 00:22:36,269
Where I come from
it was either a gun and a badge

367
00:22:36,269 --> 00:22:38,145
or a hard hat and a hammer.

368
00:22:38,187 --> 00:22:40,648
How do you feel
when you fire your weapon?

369
00:22:40,689 --> 00:22:43,442
It's like dirty Harry said...
"There's nothing wrong

370
00:22:43,442 --> 00:22:46,069
with a little shooting as long as
the right people get shot."

371
00:22:46,153 --> 00:22:48,071
Prosky: And when the wrong people
get shot?

372
00:22:48,113 --> 00:22:51,074
Turk: It sucks, but I'd rather be in it
that out of it.

373
00:22:51,116 --> 00:22:53,201
There's nothing worse
than being stuck on a bench.

374
00:22:53,243 --> 00:22:55,453
How do you feel when you see
innocent people get killed?

375
00:22:55,495 --> 00:22:57,747
You know...

376
00:22:59,498 --> 00:23:02,710
I sort of get numb to it.

377
00:23:02,751 --> 00:23:05,420
Here.

378
00:23:05,462 --> 00:23:06,922
I want you to take this.

379
00:23:07,005 --> 00:23:10,342
Use it to jot down your thoughts,
your questions,

380
00:23:10,383 --> 00:23:12,886
anything you may have noticed
about yourself,

381
00:23:12,927 --> 00:23:14,387
whatever.

382
00:23:14,429 --> 00:23:16,264
I won't ask for it.

383
00:23:16,305 --> 00:23:19,058
Just for you.

384
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,601
I want you to try it.

385
00:23:20,643 --> 00:23:22,645
Sounds like fun.

386
00:23:24,521 --> 00:23:28,108
(Karen panting)
Harder.

387
00:23:34,948 --> 00:23:37,241
(crowd cheering)

388
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:44,123
Go, Turk, go!

389
00:23:45,499 --> 00:23:48,543
You got third.
Go go!

390
00:23:48,585 --> 00:23:51,296
Yeah!
Look at that.

391
00:23:51,338 --> 00:23:53,715
You own it. You own it.

392
00:23:53,715 --> 00:23:55,591
No matter what they say
about you,

393
00:23:55,633 --> 00:23:57,718
you're tremendous!

394
00:23:59,804 --> 00:24:02,139
Go go, Turk, go!

395
00:24:03,974 --> 00:24:06,059
Safe.
You dropped the ball.

396
00:24:06,101 --> 00:24:08,437
- A fucking cheap shot, man.
- Get away from the bag.

397
00:24:08,478 --> 00:24:11,398
- Or what? Or what? Or what?
- Watch the bag.

398
00:24:11,439 --> 00:24:15,109
(all yelling)

399
00:24:23,075 --> 00:24:25,494
Turk's voice: The NYPd is bubbling
with frustration,

400
00:24:25,536 --> 00:24:27,120
hostility and testosterone,

401
00:24:27,162 --> 00:24:29,164
ready to erupt
at any moment.

402
00:24:29,206 --> 00:24:31,207
Think of me
as the release valve.

403
00:24:31,249 --> 00:24:34,085
One flick of the trigger
and the pressure goes down.

404
00:24:34,127 --> 00:24:36,212
You know why
you join the force?

405
00:24:36,295 --> 00:24:38,381
To get respect.

406
00:24:38,422 --> 00:24:40,132
Most people respect the badge.

407
00:24:40,174 --> 00:24:42,509
Everybody respects the gun.

408
00:24:47,973 --> 00:24:49,933
Hey, Riley, I was talking to Jd...

409
00:24:49,975 --> 00:24:53,061
you guys caught a stiff named
Phillip Trager, a gun-runner?

410
00:24:53,103 --> 00:24:55,313
Oh, yeah, a real piece of shit.

411
00:24:55,355 --> 00:24:57,315
- How did that go down?
- I don't know.

412
00:24:57,315 --> 00:24:59,608
Somebody gave him a taste
of his own medicine, I guess,

413
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:02,027
walked right into his apartment,
killed him with one of his own guns.

414
00:25:02,069 --> 00:25:04,321
Did the shooter leave a note
or anything?

415
00:25:04,363 --> 00:25:07,324
Yeah, actually,
the shooter left a poem.

416
00:25:10,452 --> 00:25:12,954
He did?
No shit.

417
00:25:12,996 --> 00:25:14,998
Yeah. Hey, Simon,

418
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,501
you remember that poem
from the Trager case?

419
00:25:20,503 --> 00:25:22,546
What are you doing, man?

420
00:25:22,588 --> 00:25:24,590
Turk's asking about it.

421
00:25:24,631 --> 00:25:27,092
What the hell are you doing?

422
00:25:27,134 --> 00:25:29,553
? Que mierda 'tas haciendo ahi, papa?

423
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:31,513
No le digas mierda a eso loco.

424
00:25:31,554 --> 00:25:35,183
Riley: Calmate. He wants to hear
about the poem.

425
00:25:35,224 --> 00:25:37,477
"Merchant of thieving class,

426
00:25:37,518 --> 00:25:40,646
I slit his throat
and capped his ass.

427
00:25:40,688 --> 00:25:42,147
I took his gun, I took his...

428
00:25:42,189 --> 00:25:45,150
I took his life, I took his gun,
But too bad he's not the only one."

429
00:25:45,192 --> 00:25:47,277
That's how it goes,
something like that.

430
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:49,613
It's not iambic pentameter,
but it rhymes.

431
00:25:49,654 --> 00:25:51,656
- Rooster.
- Yo.

432
00:25:52,657 --> 00:25:54,534
We're looking for the same guy.

433
00:25:54,576 --> 00:25:57,745
He knocked off a pimp named Rambo
a few weeks ago. When was yours?

434
00:25:57,787 --> 00:26:00,331
Last week. We're running ours with the ATF
because of the guns.

435
00:26:00,373 --> 00:26:03,417
We're back in business on the Rambo case.
Looks like the same guy knocked off

436
00:26:03,459 --> 00:26:05,878
- a gun dealer on the three-three last week.
- No shit.

437
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,880
- What do you mean? That's our case.
- That's our case. You're taking our case.

438
00:26:08,922 --> 00:26:11,383
Seniority, guys.
Tag along, you'll learn something.

439
00:26:11,424 --> 00:26:13,593
Oh, tell me the guy's name
is Greg Brady.

440
00:26:13,635 --> 00:26:15,595
Please. It is, isn't it?

441
00:26:15,637 --> 00:26:18,181
Oh, somebody's knocking off
the Brady Bunch.

442
00:26:18,222 --> 00:26:22,101
Gotta be the Partridge Family.
(laughs)

443
00:26:22,142 --> 00:26:25,187
Turk's voice: Trager,
a gun-runner bites the dust...

444
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:27,314
number 11.

445
00:26:35,697 --> 00:26:39,492
Karen: The bullet matched the.45
in Trager's apartment.

446
00:26:39,533 --> 00:26:41,994
That was no surprise.
So I ran it through ATF.

447
00:26:42,036 --> 00:26:45,080
It's one of a batch of six
that was stolen from a gun shop

448
00:26:45,122 --> 00:26:47,416
- in Virginia last month.
- Yeah, probably by Trager.

449
00:26:47,457 --> 00:26:50,126
That's what they think.
He matches the description they have.

450
00:26:50,168 --> 00:26:52,879
It still doesn't help us find the guy.
It just helps us tie him to the victims,

451
00:26:52,921 --> 00:26:55,381
which he's already doing
with his little fucking poems.

452
00:26:55,465 --> 00:26:58,509
- (phone ringing)
- Excuse me. Hello.

453
00:26:58,551 --> 00:27:01,762
Hey, Turk, don't forget
we got a court date later.

454
00:27:01,804 --> 00:27:04,973
So...

455
00:27:05,015 --> 00:27:08,643
I heard he kicked the shit
out of that dealer you guys took down.

456
00:27:08,685 --> 00:27:10,520
Spider.

457
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:11,730
So?

458
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:15,900
Did he?

459
00:27:18,736 --> 00:27:21,363
Yeah, he got him
down on the ground.

460
00:27:21,405 --> 00:27:23,824
The guy was handcuffed.

461
00:27:24,825 --> 00:27:27,911
And he just started
kicking him in the gut.

462
00:27:27,953 --> 00:27:30,330
And then

463
00:27:30,372 --> 00:27:32,707
he gets down on the guy's chest

464
00:27:32,749 --> 00:27:36,085
and he really starts smacking him

465
00:27:36,127 --> 00:27:39,046
hard in the face over and over

466
00:27:39,088 --> 00:27:41,090
and screaming at the top
of his lungs,

467
00:27:41,132 --> 00:27:43,384
"I'm gonna break
your fucking face,

468
00:27:43,425 --> 00:27:45,844
you little bitch!"

469
00:27:45,844 --> 00:27:48,180
Then his eyes really started
to fill up.

470
00:27:48,221 --> 00:27:50,223
I mean, they get dark...

471
00:27:50,265 --> 00:27:52,434
you know how he gets
the sort of rage in him.

472
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,229
I thought he was gonna
kill this guy.

473
00:27:57,605 --> 00:28:00,066
Really?

474
00:28:02,776 --> 00:28:05,195
You're a bad little girl.

475
00:28:05,237 --> 00:28:07,072
Hmm?

476
00:28:07,114 --> 00:28:10,158
- I got work to do.
- You bet.

477
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,538
Woman: Counselor,
my hands are tied here.

478
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,582
Without a secure
chain of custody,

479
00:28:17,623 --> 00:28:20,376
any evidence obtained
after the initial search

480
00:28:20,418 --> 00:28:22,878
- must be excluded.
- You gotta be fucking kidding me.

481
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,255
Therefore I am forced
to grant defense

482
00:28:25,297 --> 00:28:27,591
motion to dismiss
all charges

483
00:28:27,633 --> 00:28:29,843
of rape and assault
against Mr. Van Luytens.

484
00:28:29,885 --> 00:28:31,886
- Your Honor.
- Judge: You think I want this guy

485
00:28:31,928 --> 00:28:34,055
going anywhere
near my daughter,

486
00:28:34,097 --> 00:28:36,265
or anyone's daughter
for that matter?

487
00:28:36,307 --> 00:28:38,768
You messed up.
I am unleashing your client

488
00:28:38,809 --> 00:28:41,061
unto the world.
I'm sure we'll all be

489
00:28:41,103 --> 00:28:42,563
back here again very soon.

490
00:28:42,605 --> 00:28:45,566
Look at him.
Look at this motherfucker.

491
00:28:45,607 --> 00:28:49,236
Hey, it's gonna come back to you, mutt.
You're gonna get it.

492
00:28:49,277 --> 00:28:51,696
- When you walk outside watch your back.
- Easy, Turk.

493
00:28:51,738 --> 00:28:52,906
Order in my court.

494
00:28:52,947 --> 00:28:56,200
- Okay, mutt? You fucking mutt.
- Not here, not now.

495
00:28:56,242 --> 00:28:58,661
Not here, not now.
Will you get him out of here

496
00:28:58,703 --> 00:29:01,247
before somebody passes a sentence
on him you can't appeal?

497
00:29:01,288 --> 00:29:02,539
Order!

498
00:29:02,581 --> 00:29:05,709
- You know what I mean? Go go.
- Order, detective.

499
00:29:05,751 --> 00:29:09,713
Turk's voice: Dr. Prosky suggested
that I free-associate.

500
00:29:09,754 --> 00:29:12,132
So here I go.

501
00:29:12,173 --> 00:29:14,801
You know what I think about
when I pull a trigger?

502
00:29:14,842 --> 00:29:17,803
- I think about the Infield Fly Rule.
- (doorbell buzzes)

503
00:29:17,803 --> 00:29:20,848
I love that fucking rule.
It assumes the worst in everybody.

504
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:24,601
It says, "Sorry, batter, you're a schmuck
for popping up with runners on.

505
00:29:24,643 --> 00:29:27,020
And you, stupid-ass infielder,
you don't get to cheat

506
00:29:27,062 --> 00:29:29,481
and drop the ball just because
you caught a break."

507
00:29:29,523 --> 00:29:31,191
My favorite part...
the batter's out

508
00:29:31,232 --> 00:29:33,401
but the runners advance
at their own risk.

509
00:29:33,443 --> 00:29:35,695
Well, isn't this
a pleasant surprise?

510
00:29:35,737 --> 00:29:37,822
Turk's voice: That's the way
life should be.

511
00:29:37,864 --> 00:29:39,865
You can be a motherfucker
at your own risk.

512
00:29:39,907 --> 00:29:43,160
(muffled gunshots)

513
00:29:43,202 --> 00:29:46,997
Or not.
Van Luytens... one less rapist.

514
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:49,291
Who's gonna miss him?
Nobody.

515
00:29:49,332 --> 00:29:51,501
Number 12 and counting.

516
00:30:05,722 --> 00:30:07,641
Whoa whoa, hot coffee.

517
00:30:07,683 --> 00:30:09,351
- Good morning, detective Riley.
- Hey, good morning.

518
00:30:09,392 --> 00:30:11,394
- Door on your left.
- Any signs of forced entry?

519
00:30:11,394 --> 00:30:13,104
Doesn't look like it.
Detective Perez is in there.

520
00:30:13,146 --> 00:30:14,564
He's in there already?
All right.

521
00:30:14,564 --> 00:30:16,691
- Hey, how about those Mets last night?
- Yeah, how about 'em?

522
00:30:16,733 --> 00:30:18,818
Hey, Teddy, Teddy, come here,
check this out.

523
00:30:20,236 --> 00:30:22,571
Wow.

524
00:30:22,613 --> 00:30:23,864
Fuck.

525
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:26,700
- Oh my God.
- That's big.

526
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:28,702
And powerful.

527
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:31,621
- What, a plasma screen?
- LCd.

528
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,706
- That's plasma.
- No, it's got to be LCd.

529
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:36,084
- Perez: It wouldn't be that big.
- Hey, guys, guys.

530
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:39,545
He was shot at close range,
dropped right here.

531
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:42,339
The pussy doesn't look like he put up
much of a fight, does he, Karen?

532
00:30:42,381 --> 00:30:44,425
Nothing to indicate that

533
00:30:44,466 --> 00:30:48,011
in terms of struggle.
No forced entry, cuts, bruises.

534
00:30:48,053 --> 00:30:51,264
Hey, nobody wants to hear
about your private life, Officer Corelli.

535
00:30:51,306 --> 00:30:54,559
That's detective to you,
Officer Needledick.

536
00:30:54,601 --> 00:30:56,519
- Ooh.
- Perez: Ouch.

537
00:30:56,561 --> 00:30:58,896
- Looks like it's our guy again.
- Who did you get this time?

538
00:30:58,938 --> 00:31:00,564
This is Jonathan Van Luytens.

539
00:31:00,606 --> 00:31:02,566
He owns a couple
of car dealerships.

540
00:31:02,608 --> 00:31:04,943
- Oh, shit.
- He was up on rape charges,

541
00:31:04,943 --> 00:31:07,154
but they got tossed out
last week.

542
00:31:07,195 --> 00:31:09,197
Look at this.

543
00:31:09,239 --> 00:31:13,326
"A man devoid of all respect,
Of beauty, charm or intellect,

544
00:31:13,368 --> 00:31:15,787
He took what women
would not give.

545
00:31:15,828 --> 00:31:17,788
He didn't have
the right to live."

546
00:31:17,788 --> 00:31:20,166
That's our boy all right.

547
00:31:20,207 --> 00:31:23,377
Looks like he had a beef
with our old pal Jonny.

548
00:31:23,419 --> 00:31:24,503
You know him?

549
00:31:24,545 --> 00:31:26,421
Both: Yeah.

550
00:31:26,463 --> 00:31:28,757
He's one slippery
son of a bitch, let me tell you.

551
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,509
Turk: Yeah.

552
00:31:31,509 --> 00:31:34,637
Lieutenant: You guys know how much
fun it is to not catch a serial killer?

553
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:36,389
You got a point here, Lieutenant?

554
00:31:36,431 --> 00:31:38,182
The point is

555
00:31:38,224 --> 00:31:40,351
you'd better both
think seriously

556
00:31:40,393 --> 00:31:42,478
about whether or not
you want the lead on this case.

557
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:44,188
You don't think
we're up to this?

558
00:31:45,189 --> 00:31:48,400
Come on, you got what,

559
00:31:48,442 --> 00:31:51,152
about 110 years on the job
between the two of you?

560
00:31:51,194 --> 00:31:54,239
- 120.
- (laughs)

561
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,532
I'm telling you, you screw it up
badly enough,

562
00:31:56,574 --> 00:31:58,784
they may try to fuck you
out of your pension.

563
00:31:58,826 --> 00:32:00,036
You want to risk that?

564
00:32:00,077 --> 00:32:01,912
- Yeah.
- Fuck, yeah.

565
00:32:01,954 --> 00:32:06,917
406, Lieutenant. 406.

566
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:09,544
Okay, 406...
what does that mean?

567
00:32:09,586 --> 00:32:11,129
Ted Williams.

568
00:32:11,171 --> 00:32:14,215
Ted Williams, the last day of the season,
is batting 400.

569
00:32:14,257 --> 00:32:17,343
Sox manager wants to bench him,
protect his average, right?

570
00:32:17,385 --> 00:32:19,220
Williams plays
both games anyway,

571
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:21,222
goes six for eight,
ends up at 406...

572
00:32:21,222 --> 00:32:22,932
the last guy that ever hit
over 400.

573
00:32:22,973 --> 00:32:25,476
Okay, fine. It's all yours.

574
00:32:25,517 --> 00:32:28,520
Just don't go moaning to me
when some traffic cop

575
00:32:28,562 --> 00:32:30,897
pulls your serial killer over
for speeding

576
00:32:30,897 --> 00:32:33,525
and he grabs your
15 minutes of fame and you realize

577
00:32:33,566 --> 00:32:36,736
the asshole could have been
standing right there in front of you

578
00:32:36,778 --> 00:32:39,864
and it would have taken you
1000 light years to nail him.

579
00:32:39,905 --> 00:32:41,615
Not for nothing, Lieutenant,

580
00:32:41,657 --> 00:32:44,701
light years measures distance,
not time.

581
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,581
Well, thank you, detective.
I'll make a note of that.

582
00:32:49,623 --> 00:32:52,459
Ellis Lynde, 2003.

583
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,253
This guy had a history
of cruising gay bars,

584
00:32:55,295 --> 00:32:58,089
picking up twinkies,
beating the shit out of them.

585
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:01,050
Lynde was found shot dead
in his apartment.

586
00:33:01,091 --> 00:33:03,969
Whoever's doing this
gets up real close to the guys,

587
00:33:04,011 --> 00:33:06,680
blows their brains out
without any trouble,

588
00:33:06,722 --> 00:33:08,223
leaves no fingerprints

589
00:33:08,265 --> 00:33:10,058
and obviously
takes pride in his work.

590
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:14,395
Okay, what could be
murder number two back from '04,

591
00:33:14,437 --> 00:33:15,855
one Matthew Mitrella.

592
00:33:15,897 --> 00:33:17,815
(trails off)

593
00:33:20,818 --> 00:33:22,945
Turk's voice: I was shaking
the first couple of times

594
00:33:22,987 --> 00:33:25,823
I killed in cold blood.

595
00:33:25,864 --> 00:33:29,201
I kept thinking if I got caught
they'd kick me off the force.

596
00:33:29,242 --> 00:33:31,870
I wasn't worried about prison,
but losing the gun and the shield...

597
00:33:31,911 --> 00:33:33,121
that scared me.

598
00:33:33,163 --> 00:33:35,665
I went into work the next day
expecting to feel different.

599
00:33:35,707 --> 00:33:38,793
I thought everybody would look at me
the way cops look at civilians

600
00:33:38,834 --> 00:33:41,086
and know which ones are dirty.

601
00:33:48,051 --> 00:33:50,387
But they didn't.
That's when I knew

602
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:53,014
I could keep on
doing this forever.

603
00:33:56,184 --> 00:34:00,104
Turk's voice: So next stop... Spider.

604
00:34:00,146 --> 00:34:02,147
If we shut down his business,

605
00:34:02,189 --> 00:34:04,149
maybe he'd be a rat.

606
00:34:04,191 --> 00:34:06,193
We got a lawyer.

607
00:34:06,235 --> 00:34:10,030
We needed her to testify
that she bought coke from him.

608
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:12,615
She was a good lawyer.

609
00:34:12,657 --> 00:34:17,120
Me and my partner paid a visit
to Club 404 of Harlem.

610
00:34:17,161 --> 00:34:18,287
A word about him...

611
00:34:18,329 --> 00:34:21,415
Tom Cowen's been my partner
for almost 30 years.

612
00:34:21,457 --> 00:34:23,375
He's the best cop
I've ever seen.

613
00:34:25,294 --> 00:34:28,839
I'm always the one
following him through the door.

614
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,007
There's a bullet
that was meant for me

615
00:34:31,049 --> 00:34:34,636
that's lodged in his torso.

616
00:34:34,677 --> 00:34:36,721
He was my role model.

617
00:34:36,763 --> 00:34:39,140
The day I stopped
trying to be Tom Cowen

618
00:34:39,181 --> 00:34:41,642
was the greatest day
of my life.

619
00:34:55,488 --> 00:34:58,491
Hey, Rooster,

620
00:34:58,532 --> 00:35:01,535
I was going through the files
on poetry boy.

621
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:03,829
That's an interesting way
to pass your time.

622
00:35:03,871 --> 00:35:06,290
Okay, there was a gun

623
00:35:06,331 --> 00:35:08,500
found on Charles Randall
when he was arrested.

624
00:35:08,542 --> 00:35:09,751
Yeah.

625
00:35:09,793 --> 00:35:12,962
Now in all the other shootings
the gun was left at the scene,

626
00:35:13,004 --> 00:35:16,174
but there are a lot of similarities.
So I mentioned it to Perez and Riley.

627
00:35:16,215 --> 00:35:18,259
I think somebody should go
interview him in prison.

628
00:35:18,301 --> 00:35:20,928
I think there may be a connection.

629
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:24,431
That's a good idea,
but not Perez and Riley.

630
00:35:24,473 --> 00:35:26,934
I mean, not those guys.
They'll screw it up.

631
00:35:26,975 --> 00:35:29,102
This is too important.

632
00:35:29,144 --> 00:35:31,604
Turk and I will handle Randall, okay?

633
00:35:31,646 --> 00:35:33,189
Good work.

634
00:35:56,669 --> 00:35:58,671
(door buzzes)

635
00:36:04,635 --> 00:36:07,012
Detectives, Charles Randall.

636
00:36:08,847 --> 00:36:11,975
What the fuck
do you two scumbags want?

637
00:36:12,017 --> 00:36:14,686
What a greeting.

638
00:36:14,727 --> 00:36:17,813
You like poetry, Chuck?

639
00:36:17,855 --> 00:36:18,898
What?

640
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:22,151
Do you like poetry?

641
00:36:23,193 --> 00:36:26,863
Yeah.
Roses are red, violets are blue,

642
00:36:26,905 --> 00:36:29,866
I want to poke out your fucking eyes
with my dick, you fuck.

643
00:36:29,908 --> 00:36:31,868
How's that?

644
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:34,537
I thought you'd rhyme.
You didn't.

645
00:36:34,579 --> 00:36:36,748
Fuck you.
Fuck both of you.

646
00:36:36,789 --> 00:36:38,416
Get me out of here.

647
00:36:38,457 --> 00:36:41,377
(door buzzes)

648
00:36:41,418 --> 00:36:44,880
(siren wailing)

649
00:36:44,922 --> 00:36:48,383
(blues playing)

650
00:36:48,425 --> 00:36:50,719
Why the fuck did we even bother
going out there?

651
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,846
What would it look like
if we didn't go?

652
00:36:54,597 --> 00:36:56,766
Are you gonna relax?

653
00:36:56,808 --> 00:36:58,809
Relax.

654
00:36:58,851 --> 00:37:00,770
Yeah, I'll just take it out
on Karen later.

655
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:03,063
The more I'm with her,
the more abuse she wants.

656
00:37:03,105 --> 00:37:04,398
Sounds like fun.

657
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,024
Hey, you want to take her
off my hands?

658
00:37:06,066 --> 00:37:10,528
Be careful, partner, because I have
a very special effect on women.

659
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:11,738
Go wild.

660
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,198
Whatever.

661
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:16,242
I can't believe I had to face
that piece of shit and look like an idiot.

662
00:37:16,284 --> 00:37:19,578
Eh, fuck him.
He's where he belongs.

663
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,247
I'm sorry, partner,
I'm really sorry.

664
00:37:21,288 --> 00:37:24,208
Stop worrying about it.

665
00:37:26,043 --> 00:37:29,754
Whatever happens,
I'm not taking you down with me.

666
00:37:29,796 --> 00:37:32,757
Don't worry about me.
I'm all right, believe me.

667
00:37:32,799 --> 00:37:36,052
I don't know what I was thinking.
I just don't know what I was thinking.

668
00:37:36,094 --> 00:37:38,429
You know what you was thinking?
You were thinking

669
00:37:38,471 --> 00:37:41,098
about a 10-year-old girl
who had her skull crushed.

670
00:37:42,141 --> 00:37:44,601
Yeah, I tried to stop you,
but you know what?

671
00:37:44,643 --> 00:37:48,897
I admired you that day,
what you did.

672
00:37:48,939 --> 00:37:51,900
That was righteous.

673
00:37:51,941 --> 00:37:55,778
And you don't second-guess yourself
on something like that.

674
00:38:02,785 --> 00:38:04,787
Okay, I'm the killer.

675
00:38:04,828 --> 00:38:07,331
I'm the killer.
I show up at your door

676
00:38:07,372 --> 00:38:09,374
or your car window,

677
00:38:09,416 --> 00:38:11,710
and for some reason
you open your door,

678
00:38:11,751 --> 00:38:14,671
you roll down
your car window for me.

679
00:38:14,712 --> 00:38:16,923
So who am I?

680
00:38:16,964 --> 00:38:19,342
Someone I know.

681
00:38:19,383 --> 00:38:20,843
Maybe a nice set of tits.

682
00:38:20,885 --> 00:38:23,012
And the poems?
What about the poems?

683
00:38:23,053 --> 00:38:25,389
You have to compose the poem
before you got there, right?

684
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:27,432
Otherwise what, you're gonna
blow out the guy's brains,

685
00:38:27,474 --> 00:38:29,351
sit down and write a little sonnet
for yourself?

686
00:38:29,392 --> 00:38:30,769
No prints on the poems,

687
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:33,813
so probably
I wore gloves when I wrote it.

688
00:38:33,855 --> 00:38:36,899
You obviously know your victims.
Between that and the easy access,

689
00:38:36,941 --> 00:38:39,276
I guess that they know you too.
They must.

690
00:38:39,318 --> 00:38:41,737
These guys are all scumbags.
They're not gonna trust anyone,

691
00:38:41,779 --> 00:38:44,364
open the door for anyone,
especially if they don't know them.

692
00:38:44,406 --> 00:38:46,742
Yeah, but I more than know them.

693
00:38:46,742 --> 00:38:49,077
I know everything about them.
I know their moves,

694
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,996
their patterns,
I know their schedules.

695
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:53,831
Okay, so you're following them.
You're staking them out.

696
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:09,679
Anyone gonna say it?

697
00:39:09,721 --> 00:39:11,639
What?

698
00:39:14,142 --> 00:39:16,811
Fuck me.

699
00:39:18,479 --> 00:39:20,356
- He's right, it's a cop.
- No.

700
00:39:20,398 --> 00:39:22,691
Let's slow down, fellows.
We're getting way ahead of ourselves.

701
00:39:22,733 --> 00:39:26,320
- Come on, it's a cop, you know it.
- I don't know shit. Neither do you.

702
00:39:26,361 --> 00:39:29,239
I'm telling your right now,
it's a cop, it's a cop, it's a cop.

703
00:39:29,281 --> 00:39:30,949
What do you mean,
"It's a cop, it's a cop, it's a cop"?

704
00:39:30,991 --> 00:39:34,285
- Where do you come off saying it's a cop?
- Easy, partner, he's just saying it.

705
00:39:34,285 --> 00:39:36,913
- What are you talking about?
- He's just saying...

706
00:39:36,954 --> 00:39:40,291
I know, I know, I know
what he's saying.

707
00:39:41,959 --> 00:39:43,711
And I'm saying it's bullshit.

708
00:39:44,711 --> 00:39:47,673
Shoot me. What the fuck?
But don't say it's a cop.

709
00:39:51,801 --> 00:39:55,013
#You cast a spell on me #

710
00:39:55,054 --> 00:39:57,598
#I was blind and now I see #

711
00:39:57,682 --> 00:40:00,643
#You work your magic,
that's the key #

712
00:40:00,684 --> 00:40:03,270
#You wave your wand #

713
00:40:03,312 --> 00:40:06,857
#And cast a spell on me... #

714
00:40:06,898 --> 00:40:08,900
Turk: So what about dinner?

715
00:40:08,942 --> 00:40:10,527
You feel like going out?

716
00:40:10,569 --> 00:40:12,362
Where?

717
00:40:12,404 --> 00:40:14,280
I don't care.
You're the one going.

718
00:40:14,322 --> 00:40:16,157
What is your problem?

719
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:18,159
No problem.

720
00:40:18,201 --> 00:40:20,327
If you feel like hanging around,
be my guest.

721
00:40:20,369 --> 00:40:21,704
I don't feel like going out.

722
00:40:21,745 --> 00:40:24,915
Fine, just don't bug me.

723
00:40:24,957 --> 00:40:29,085
This is the best part of my day
and I don't need you fucking it up.

724
00:40:30,879 --> 00:40:33,882
So you only fuck cops?

725
00:40:33,923 --> 00:40:36,801
Once in a while
I do a fireman or an ex-con.

726
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:40,388
You lump us in together?

727
00:40:40,429 --> 00:40:42,556
Well, I have some respect
for firemen.

728
00:40:42,598 --> 00:40:44,391
Fuck you.

729
00:40:44,433 --> 00:40:46,393
You know why they take away
your nightstick

730
00:40:46,393 --> 00:40:48,645
- when you hang up your uniform?
- No.

731
00:40:48,687 --> 00:40:50,855
They don't trust you with it.

732
00:40:50,897 --> 00:40:53,066
Right now I wouldn't trust
myself with it either.

733
00:40:53,107 --> 00:40:55,151
Shit, you'd probably love that.

734
00:40:55,193 --> 00:40:56,861
Too bad you never met
Van Luytens.

735
00:40:56,903 --> 00:40:58,571
You two really would have
hit it off great.

736
00:40:58,613 --> 00:41:00,781
At least somebody finally
brought some justice down

737
00:41:00,823 --> 00:41:02,658
on that dickless little fuck.

738
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,993
Now that is who I'd like to meet.

739
00:41:05,035 --> 00:41:06,912
Well, maybe you'll get
your wish one day.

740
00:41:06,954 --> 00:41:08,789
They think it's a cop.

741
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:10,457
- Makes sense.
- Bullshit.

742
00:41:10,498 --> 00:41:12,500
It's just some fucking psychopath.

743
00:41:12,542 --> 00:41:14,877
Well, there's plenty of those
on the job.

744
00:41:23,302 --> 00:41:24,887
- Are you sleeping well?
- Not really.

745
00:41:24,928 --> 00:41:26,430
- Yep.
- Eating well?

746
00:41:26,471 --> 00:41:27,931
- No.
- Yeah.

747
00:41:27,973 --> 00:41:29,182
Any recurring nightmares?

748
00:41:29,224 --> 00:41:31,726
Yeah, that I'm stuck
in a room with you forever.

749
00:41:32,936 --> 00:41:34,270
Nope.

750
00:41:34,312 --> 00:41:36,105
Do you think you're fit
to return to duty?

751
00:41:36,147 --> 00:41:38,149
- Abso-fucking-lutely.
- Yeah.

752
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:41,318
- You ever think about retiring?
- You mean, death with benefits?

753
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,153
What's not to like?

754
00:41:43,195 --> 00:41:45,155
- You ever think about retiring?
- Not really.

755
00:41:45,197 --> 00:41:47,199
What have I got to look forward to?

756
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,451
Sailing my 26-footer
around Sheepshead Bay,

757
00:41:49,493 --> 00:41:50,910
umpiring cops' softball?

758
00:41:50,952 --> 00:41:53,037
- How about corporate security work?
- It's too dangerous.

759
00:41:53,079 --> 00:41:56,332
- So what are you gonna do?
- Maybe I'll buy a boat.

760
00:41:56,374 --> 00:41:57,416
Turk: All right, look,
I don't know if I believe this,

761
00:41:57,416 --> 00:41:58,459
Turk: All right, look,
I don't know if I believe this,

762
00:41:58,501 --> 00:42:00,294
but I'm just gonna
throw it out there.

763
00:42:00,336 --> 00:42:02,630
You guys say we're looking
for one of our own,

764
00:42:02,671 --> 00:42:06,633
but what if it was an ex-cop,
somebody with an axe to grind?

765
00:42:06,675 --> 00:42:08,343
You got one in mind?

766
00:42:08,385 --> 00:42:11,513
He's thinking about Martin Baum

767
00:42:11,554 --> 00:42:14,307
our old lieutenant.

768
00:42:14,349 --> 00:42:16,726
So what's the story with him?

769
00:42:16,768 --> 00:42:18,769
He got fired a few years ago.

770
00:42:18,811 --> 00:42:21,981
I'm not saying there's any motive,
but he knew all the victims.

771
00:42:22,022 --> 00:42:25,609
Yeah, but Turk,
I knew most of those guys.

772
00:42:25,651 --> 00:42:28,820
So did you, Riley, Perez.
Even Karen knew 'em.

773
00:42:28,862 --> 00:42:30,905
- I'm just throwing it out there.
- Well, maybe you killed 'em.

774
00:42:30,947 --> 00:42:34,242
Yeah, maybe I did.

775
00:42:34,284 --> 00:42:36,452
The poems and the placement
of the weapons

776
00:42:36,494 --> 00:42:38,287
are all we've got
linking the kills,

777
00:42:38,329 --> 00:42:41,040
which means what we gotta do now
is get humping on the forensics.

778
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,417
That shouldn't be
too much of a problem.

779
00:42:43,459 --> 00:42:45,460
We already got the girl
working on that.

780
00:42:45,502 --> 00:42:49,256
That's right, Karen's been
humping on it all week, as we speak.

781
00:42:49,297 --> 00:42:51,758
What did you say?

782
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,051
Here we go again.

783
00:42:53,092 --> 00:42:54,886
- You should watch your mouth.
- Oh, yeah?

784
00:42:54,886 --> 00:42:57,388
He didn't mean anything by it.
Karen and him are ancient history.

785
00:42:57,388 --> 00:42:59,557
- College boy can't speak for himself?
- Yeah, I can speak for myself.

786
00:42:59,598 --> 00:43:01,392
Let me speak for myself...
fuck you, Turk.

787
00:43:01,433 --> 00:43:03,394
Mutt, I'm gonna hit you
on the head with this barbell.

788
00:43:03,435 --> 00:43:05,521
I'm not better than you.
You're not better than me, man.

789
00:43:05,562 --> 00:43:07,272
You put your balls
in your pocket.

790
00:43:07,314 --> 00:43:08,982
And you, fellow officers,

791
00:43:09,024 --> 00:43:13,236
a little courtesy
for a fellow professional, you know?

792
00:43:13,278 --> 00:43:16,280
Please. Are we gonna move on
here now?

793
00:43:16,322 --> 00:43:18,324
What are we doing?
Where were we?

794
00:43:18,366 --> 00:43:21,911
Talking about Martin Baum.
What's his story?

795
00:43:21,952 --> 00:43:24,455
Some guys under him
got caught taking money.

796
00:43:24,496 --> 00:43:26,748
Baum stood up for them,
tried to cover it up.

797
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:29,209
He do time?

798
00:43:29,251 --> 00:43:32,087
Well, they pressed charges,
but he plead out and resigned.

799
00:43:32,128 --> 00:43:34,088
So what's his beef with you?

800
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:35,965
I could have lied to protect him,
but I didn't.

801
00:43:36,007 --> 00:43:39,010
Okay, but if he's got a beef with you,
why not go after you?

802
00:43:39,051 --> 00:43:41,554
Why not kill you? Why go around
acting like a serial killer,

803
00:43:41,595 --> 00:43:43,430
killing all these degenerates?
It doesn't make any sense.

804
00:43:43,472 --> 00:43:45,933
- I'm just telling you.
- I'm telling you it doesn't make sense.

805
00:43:45,974 --> 00:43:48,018
I'm throwing it out there.
I'm saying this is what it is.

806
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:50,145
You want to check him out or not?
I don't give a shit.

807
00:43:50,186 --> 00:43:52,730
- It doesn't make any sense.
- You're the ones that think it's a cop.

808
00:43:52,772 --> 00:43:54,691
I'm just saying here's a cop
with a chip on his shoulder.

809
00:43:54,732 --> 00:43:56,734
Check him out if you want.
I don't give a shit.

810
00:43:56,776 --> 00:44:00,112
Calm down and give a better reason
why Baum could be a suspect, okay?

811
00:44:00,154 --> 00:44:01,906
(door slams)

812
00:44:01,947 --> 00:44:04,366
PMS, gotta be.

813
00:44:11,164 --> 00:44:14,042
- Hey, guys.
- What's going on?

814
00:44:14,083 --> 00:44:16,502
I came over to bring you
the FBI report

815
00:44:16,502 --> 00:44:18,504
on the paper
and handwriting.

816
00:44:18,504 --> 00:44:20,631
You don't have a problem
with me looking over the evidence

817
00:44:20,673 --> 00:44:23,133
that I collected and processed
for you, do you?

818
00:44:23,175 --> 00:44:25,052
- No problem.
- Put it back, Karen.

819
00:44:25,093 --> 00:44:27,095
- This is fascinating.
- Let's go, come on.

820
00:44:27,137 --> 00:44:29,097
Come on, let's go, let's go.

821
00:44:29,139 --> 00:44:30,932
- What?
- Come on, let's go.

822
00:44:30,974 --> 00:44:32,976
Get your hands off me.

823
00:44:33,017 --> 00:44:35,269
I'll give you a little privacy.
I don't want to interrupt anything here.

824
00:44:35,311 --> 00:44:37,104
Are you afraid of me
looking at your old case files?

825
00:44:37,146 --> 00:44:39,607
- Is that it?
- Okay, I'm gone. Enjoy.

826
00:44:39,648 --> 00:44:41,650
- What?
- What is it with you?

827
00:44:41,692 --> 00:44:43,694
- What is it with you?
- (door slams)

828
00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:50,492
I'm sorry about last night, okay?

829
00:44:50,575 --> 00:44:53,203
I really am. It's a habit.

830
00:44:53,244 --> 00:44:56,164
Habits can be broken, right?

831
00:44:56,205 --> 00:44:57,582
That's bullshit.

832
00:44:57,623 --> 00:44:58,874
No.

833
00:44:58,916 --> 00:45:01,418
I'm totally serious, all right?

834
00:45:02,878 --> 00:45:05,172
It's not bullshit,

835
00:45:05,214 --> 00:45:07,174
really.

836
00:45:13,888 --> 00:45:16,349
Perez: Why do you think
Turk was so quick to take the lead

837
00:45:16,391 --> 00:45:19,268
on the poetry case, huh?
To keep us from finding the killer, man.

838
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:21,687
That's what I would do
if I was covering my tracks.

839
00:45:21,729 --> 00:45:24,648
He sticks us on this Baum stakeout
'cause it's more misdirection.

840
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:25,858
Makes sense.

841
00:45:25,899 --> 00:45:28,068
I hate that Turk, man.

842
00:45:34,782 --> 00:45:36,742
(buzzing)

843
00:45:56,761 --> 00:45:58,763
Hey, he's coming out.
He's coming out.

844
00:46:00,973 --> 00:46:03,309
Oh, at 2:45 in the morning.

845
00:46:06,603 --> 00:46:10,065
Is it killing time
or is he just killing time?

846
00:46:29,708 --> 00:46:32,168
Come on, Baum,
go kill someone already.

847
00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:34,754
Perez: Yeah, kill Turk, man.
He's the one setting you up.

848
00:46:34,796 --> 00:46:36,255
Do us all a favor.

849
00:46:41,385 --> 00:46:43,887
Hey, did you see Turk's
marksmanship scores?

850
00:46:43,929 --> 00:46:45,472
Did you see this?
It's ridiculous.

851
00:46:45,556 --> 00:46:47,432
Service... 99,
70 out of 100.

852
00:46:47,474 --> 00:46:50,894
Combat Association awards,
department commendations.

853
00:46:50,935 --> 00:46:53,354
This guy could take out your left nut
at 50 yards.

854
00:46:56,607 --> 00:46:58,651
Perez: Did you see the computer
trajectories, man?

855
00:46:58,693 --> 00:47:00,111
Not one stray slug.

856
00:47:00,152 --> 00:47:02,488
Even Berkowitz put a couple
in the Corinthian leather.

857
00:47:07,617 --> 00:47:10,078
Riley: What about Karen?
She come up with anything new?

858
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,996
Perez: No, not yet.

859
00:47:12,038 --> 00:47:13,998
If Baum kills somebody
I don't want us to be in the car

860
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,417
waiting when it happens, okay?

861
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:19,879
I'll go.

862
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,922
Attaboy, Teddy, attaboy.

863
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:23,340
I'm proud of you, son.

864
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,512
(lighter clicks)

865
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:36,727
(cocks gun)
You're Perez, right?

866
00:47:36,769 --> 00:47:38,104
Yeah.

867
00:47:38,104 --> 00:47:39,814
I'm Martin Baum.

868
00:47:43,442 --> 00:47:45,569
I got a permit for this.

869
00:47:45,611 --> 00:47:48,321
I work security
in the diamond district.

870
00:47:48,363 --> 00:47:51,157
So you figure it's a cop
doing the poetry killings?

871
00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:54,077
Someone says, "Check out Baum.
He thinks he got a raw deal."

872
00:47:54,118 --> 00:47:56,537
That's what passes
for police work these days?

873
00:47:56,579 --> 00:47:58,080
Do you think
you got a raw deal?

874
00:47:58,122 --> 00:47:59,957
Damn straight.

875
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:02,334
- Life sucks.
- Yeah.

876
00:48:02,376 --> 00:48:04,920
- Everything okay, Simon?
- Teddy, where the fuck were you, man?

877
00:48:04,962 --> 00:48:07,297
Anything else you want to tell us,
Lieutenant Baum?

878
00:48:07,297 --> 00:48:11,217
- I got something for you in my pocket.
- Huh-uh!

879
00:48:12,761 --> 00:48:17,473
A passport, credit card receipts,
boarding passes.

880
00:48:17,515 --> 00:48:19,517
The day Brady was killed

881
00:48:19,558 --> 00:48:21,727
I was escorting a client
to Brazil.

882
00:48:26,064 --> 00:48:29,151
Man: Judgment is
the dominion of the Lord.

883
00:48:29,192 --> 00:48:32,112
And if this person,
this worthless rapist

884
00:48:32,153 --> 00:48:34,656
or murderer,
as you describe him,

885
00:48:34,697 --> 00:48:38,117
if he is truly repentant
and seeks absolution,

886
00:48:38,159 --> 00:48:40,494
it must be granted to him.

887
00:48:40,536 --> 00:48:42,997
Your name doesn't ring a bell,

888
00:48:43,038 --> 00:48:47,292
but I've had so many
altar boys over the years.

889
00:48:47,334 --> 00:48:50,003
(muffled gunshot)

890
00:48:51,379 --> 00:48:53,381
Turk's voice: So many altar boys

891
00:48:53,423 --> 00:48:56,134
that it's hard to remember
their names.

892
00:48:56,175 --> 00:48:59,220
My name is david Fisk,
detective First Grade.

893
00:48:59,261 --> 00:49:01,514
You may not
remember me now,

894
00:49:01,555 --> 00:49:04,725
but I guarantee you'll remember my name
for the rest of your life.

895
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:08,645
Father Connell,
may he rot in hell.

896
00:49:08,687 --> 00:49:11,147
13 down, one to go.

897
00:49:11,189 --> 00:49:13,858
(bells tolling)

898
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:16,235
(police radio chatter)

899
00:49:19,572 --> 00:49:23,200
Karen: White underwear
below the knee.

900
00:49:23,242 --> 00:49:25,702
- (camera shutter clicking)
- Briefs-style.

901
00:49:25,744 --> 00:49:28,163
Large tweezers.

902
00:49:28,205 --> 00:49:31,666
I am removing a card that has been
inserted in the rectum of the deceased

903
00:49:31,708 --> 00:49:35,712
and placing it
in a plastic evidence bag.

904
00:49:38,422 --> 00:49:42,176
- I'll be right back.
- All right.

905
00:49:43,844 --> 00:49:46,471
Hey. It's another one,

906
00:49:46,513 --> 00:49:48,723
handwritten.

907
00:49:51,976 --> 00:49:54,771
"The old man
who the children trust,

908
00:49:54,812 --> 00:49:58,441
Unable to control his lust,

909
00:49:58,482 --> 00:50:01,360
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

910
00:50:01,402 --> 00:50:05,447
The church can't stop him.
Someone must."

911
00:50:06,823 --> 00:50:08,825
I'll see what else I can find.

912
00:50:14,414 --> 00:50:16,666
What's the matter with you?

913
00:50:16,707 --> 00:50:19,001
Father Connell gave me
my first communion

914
00:50:19,043 --> 00:50:21,795
back in Bensonhurst.

915
00:50:24,173 --> 00:50:26,675
Hey, guys.
Sorry we didn't get a chance to call.

916
00:50:26,717 --> 00:50:29,803
- Yeah, I bet you are.
- Go over there, take a look around.

917
00:50:29,844 --> 00:50:31,971
We'll compare notes later, okay?

918
00:50:32,013 --> 00:50:35,141
Looks like our friend just settled
an old score with the priest,

919
00:50:35,183 --> 00:50:37,143
left him with his pants down.

920
00:50:37,185 --> 00:50:38,811
- Come on.
- No, look.

921
00:50:38,853 --> 00:50:40,354
Come on, don't talk like that.

922
00:50:40,354 --> 00:50:42,356
- Hey, look for yourself.
- Have a little respect.

923
00:50:43,857 --> 00:50:47,069
Next thing they're gonna tell us
Lieutenant Baum was an altar boy here.

924
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:50,530
Tell me about it.
These two guys fucking stink.

925
00:50:50,572 --> 00:50:52,907
Look, doctor,
you read the poems.

926
00:50:52,949 --> 00:50:55,159
It is possible, right,
that this guy is a cop?

927
00:50:55,201 --> 00:50:57,578
I've never seen it.

928
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:00,414
I've never even heard
about a cop serial killer.

929
00:51:00,456 --> 00:51:02,625
Come on, girls,
let's go, let's go.

930
00:51:03,625 --> 00:51:07,587
Yeah. Go go go go go
go go go go!

931
00:51:07,629 --> 00:51:08,672
Safe.

932
00:51:08,713 --> 00:51:11,174
Doc, give us a tip.
How are we gonna catch this guy?

933
00:51:11,216 --> 00:51:13,176
You don't have to worry
about that.

934
00:51:13,218 --> 00:51:14,886
He wants to get caught.

935
00:51:17,221 --> 00:51:19,890
You don't have any better place
to have lunch?

936
00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:21,725
I wanted to thank you.

937
00:51:21,725 --> 00:51:23,477
What, about Spider?

938
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:25,187
Yeah.

939
00:51:25,229 --> 00:51:27,814
And for looking in on me
at the hospital

940
00:51:27,856 --> 00:51:29,357
and the encouragement.

941
00:51:29,441 --> 00:51:30,734
Why would he want that?

942
00:51:30,734 --> 00:51:33,319
After a while
getting away with it isn't enough.

943
00:51:33,361 --> 00:51:35,363
Jessica: So is your daughter
on the team?

944
00:51:35,405 --> 00:51:38,241
No, she used to play,
but now she's 25, living in California,

945
00:51:38,282 --> 00:51:40,951
five years sober
and working as a nurse.

946
00:51:40,993 --> 00:51:43,162
And her mother?

947
00:51:43,203 --> 00:51:45,205
Her mother died
when she was very young.

948
00:51:46,248 --> 00:51:49,167
Doctor: He wants everybody to know
that he got away with it,

949
00:51:49,209 --> 00:51:53,213
to show everybody
just how brilliant he is.

950
00:51:53,296 --> 00:51:56,424
Most of these killings were criminals
in Rooster's and his beat, right?

951
00:51:56,466 --> 00:51:58,342
And then he all but threatens
to kill Van Luytens

952
00:51:58,384 --> 00:52:00,344
in front of hundreds of witnesses.
And then he sends us

953
00:52:00,386 --> 00:52:03,430
on this crazy wild goose chase
after Lieutenant Baum, didn't he?

954
00:52:03,472 --> 00:52:05,474
- Yes, he did.
- Why would he do that? Why?

955
00:52:05,516 --> 00:52:08,060
You gotta show me more than that.
So far you got shit.

956
00:52:08,101 --> 00:52:09,686
- Give him more, man.
- You want more?

957
00:52:09,728 --> 00:52:12,355
- How about the church records?
- The very ones that Turk was

958
00:52:12,397 --> 00:52:14,315
so diligently pursuing.
How about that?

959
00:52:14,357 --> 00:52:17,276
It turns out our most recent victim,
the late Father Connell,

960
00:52:17,318 --> 00:52:20,029
was moved all over the place...
eight parishes in 20 years.

961
00:52:20,071 --> 00:52:22,573
Why would they do that
with a Catholic priest? It's obvious.

962
00:52:22,615 --> 00:52:25,117
He's giving the children
more than communion behind the altar.

963
00:52:25,159 --> 00:52:27,577
Now Turk already admits
to knowing this guy as a child.

964
00:52:27,619 --> 00:52:28,954
It's very plausible.

965
00:52:30,372 --> 00:52:33,541
Lieutenant: This priest,
this Father Connell,

966
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:35,293
he gave you your first
holy communion, eh?

967
00:52:35,335 --> 00:52:36,461
He did.

968
00:52:36,502 --> 00:52:39,714
Did he every try to do
anything inappropriate? I mean...

969
00:52:39,755 --> 00:52:41,757
I know what you mean.
No, never.

970
00:52:43,467 --> 00:52:45,469
Okay, fine.
Is there any reason

971
00:52:45,511 --> 00:52:47,721
why somebody out there
might think that he did?

972
00:52:47,763 --> 00:52:49,306
No.

973
00:52:49,347 --> 00:52:51,683
Am I a suspect here, Lieutenant?

974
00:52:52,725 --> 00:52:54,769
No,

975
00:52:54,811 --> 00:52:58,648
but these bodies
are starting to smell.

976
00:52:58,689 --> 00:53:01,275
A lot of it is drifting
in your direction.

977
00:53:01,317 --> 00:53:03,319
Drifting or being pushed?

978
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:05,445
What can I say?

979
00:53:05,487 --> 00:53:07,906
You got connections
to most of these victims.

980
00:53:07,948 --> 00:53:10,867
You're not exactly
Mother Teresa.

981
00:53:12,202 --> 00:53:15,079
I never had any problem
with that priest.

982
00:53:15,121 --> 00:53:18,040
Okay. Okay, fine.

983
00:53:18,082 --> 00:53:20,835
That settles it.

984
00:53:26,965 --> 00:53:29,050
I had a talk with Riley and Perez.

985
00:53:29,092 --> 00:53:30,635
Good cops.

986
00:53:30,677 --> 00:53:33,138
Don't fuck around, okay?
Just listen.

987
00:53:33,179 --> 00:53:34,430
I'm listening.

988
00:53:34,472 --> 00:53:36,891
They think
Turk might be our guy.

989
00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:43,022
Oh, man. I gotta tell you,

990
00:53:43,063 --> 00:53:45,732
from where I'm sitting
that is so fucking funny.

991
00:53:45,774 --> 00:53:47,859
You can't take that seriously.

992
00:53:47,901 --> 00:53:50,862
Everybody has pretty much
accepted the fact

993
00:53:50,904 --> 00:53:53,448
- that we're chasing one of our own.
- But it ain't Turk.

994
00:53:53,489 --> 00:53:55,241
Sure as I'm sitting here
he ain't the guy.

995
00:53:55,283 --> 00:53:56,909
- You know that?
- Yes, I do.

996
00:53:56,951 --> 00:53:59,453
- How do you know that?
- Because I know it.

997
00:53:59,453 --> 00:54:02,039
I know it to a moral certainty.

998
00:54:02,081 --> 00:54:03,540
Okay?

999
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:06,752
This priest,

1000
00:54:06,793 --> 00:54:09,379
this Father Connell...

1001
00:54:09,421 --> 00:54:11,715
he was Turk's priest
when he was a kid.

1002
00:54:11,756 --> 00:54:12,757
He told you that.

1003
00:54:12,799 --> 00:54:15,134
He didn't tell me this priest
was a child molester.

1004
00:54:15,134 --> 00:54:18,095
- I can't believe this bullshit.
- Believe it, all right?

1005
00:54:18,137 --> 00:54:20,681
- Turk's a good guy.
- You understand?

1006
00:54:20,723 --> 00:54:22,975
- He's the best cop you got.
- Don't you tell me what I gotta do.

1007
00:54:23,017 --> 00:54:25,102
Don't you say a goddamn word
to him about this either,

1008
00:54:25,144 --> 00:54:27,062
or you're finished.

1009
00:54:30,398 --> 00:54:33,902
(humming a tune)

1010
00:54:36,988 --> 00:54:38,990
Can I speak now?

1011
00:54:39,031 --> 00:54:40,825
Feel free.

1012
00:54:41,825 --> 00:54:45,662
He cares.
You know what I'm saying?

1013
00:54:45,704 --> 00:54:48,623
Turk cares about people.

1014
00:54:49,958 --> 00:54:52,961
I know he runs around
like a pit bull on crack sometimes.

1015
00:54:53,002 --> 00:54:55,588
It doesn't matter.

1016
00:54:55,630 --> 00:54:57,882
He cares about protecting people.

1017
00:54:57,924 --> 00:54:59,967
And if you don't back him,

1018
00:55:00,051 --> 00:55:03,887
you will regret it.

1019
00:55:23,405 --> 00:55:25,073
(bangs)

1020
00:55:25,115 --> 00:55:26,617
Jesus.

1021
00:55:26,658 --> 00:55:28,368
Sorry.

1022
00:55:28,410 --> 00:55:31,121
I just never rattled
anyone's cage before.

1023
00:55:31,162 --> 00:55:34,207
- Got a minute?
- Yeah, what's up?

1024
00:55:34,249 --> 00:55:37,668
You know me and Turk
are buddies, right?

1025
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:39,211
Of course.

1026
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:40,713
I'd do anything for him.

1027
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:43,173
He would do anything for you.

1028
00:55:43,215 --> 00:55:44,425
Would you?

1029
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:46,009
Would I what?

1030
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:48,053
Would you do anything for him?

1031
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:53,433
I don't know...
where is this going?

1032
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:55,476
He wants you
to have sex with me.

1033
00:55:57,603 --> 00:55:59,522
Really?

1034
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,275
He wouldn't mind.

1035
00:56:03,275 --> 00:56:05,986
But that's not why I'm here.

1036
00:56:06,028 --> 00:56:08,697
Okay, why are you here?

1037
00:56:08,738 --> 00:56:11,950
Where were you
the night Rambo was killed

1038
00:56:11,991 --> 00:56:14,952
and Trager?
Got an alibi for those nights?

1039
00:56:16,454 --> 00:56:19,707
I mean, did you know either one
those guys before they were murdered?

1040
00:56:19,749 --> 00:56:22,710
Makes you uncomfortable
when I talk like that.

1041
00:56:22,751 --> 00:56:25,546
You look like you're guilty.
You're not guilty.

1042
00:56:25,587 --> 00:56:27,672
I know that.
You didn't kill those guys, did you?

1043
00:56:31,343 --> 00:56:34,387
Now you know what Turk feels.

1044
00:56:38,432 --> 00:56:42,144
I need you to get me
some information

1045
00:56:42,186 --> 00:56:44,229
discreetly.

1046
00:56:45,856 --> 00:56:47,315
Can you do that for me?

1047
00:56:47,357 --> 00:56:49,609
You got it.

1048
00:56:49,651 --> 00:56:51,319
Absolutely.

1049
00:56:51,361 --> 00:56:53,321
Let's solve these fucking murders.

1050
00:56:55,531 --> 00:56:57,658
(phone rings)

1051
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:59,076
Oh.

1052
00:56:59,118 --> 00:57:01,203
- Rooster: Hey, boy genius.
- Perfect timing, buddy.

1053
00:57:01,245 --> 00:57:03,288
Listen, you really worked
on Hingis, didn't you?

1054
00:57:03,330 --> 00:57:04,998
He was all worked up
about my partner.

1055
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,959
Good. He should be.

1056
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,544
I think we should sit down,
see if we can square things, okay?

1057
00:57:09,586 --> 00:57:12,797
All right. Want to meet at Montrose
at 8:00 PM?

1058
00:57:12,839 --> 00:57:16,134
Could you make that 9:00?
I gotta meet an old friend.

1059
00:57:16,175 --> 00:57:17,802
Yeah, sure, whatever you want.

1060
00:57:20,346 --> 00:57:23,640
(blues playing)
#Baby's got issues #

1061
00:57:23,682 --> 00:57:27,144
#Baby's got pains... #

1062
00:57:27,185 --> 00:57:29,187
- Hey, fellows.
- Hey.

1063
00:57:29,229 --> 00:57:32,357
Thanks for coming.

1064
00:57:32,398 --> 00:57:35,026
- This here is Cheryl Brooks.
- Hello, Cheryl Brooks.

1065
00:57:35,068 --> 00:57:37,069
Cheryl's got something to tell you.

1066
00:57:38,237 --> 00:57:41,866
My daughter Lynn

1067
00:57:41,907 --> 00:57:44,451
died four years ago.

1068
00:57:44,493 --> 00:57:47,412
She was 10 years old.
She was raped and she was murdered.

1069
00:57:49,539 --> 00:57:53,668
The guy I was living with,
Charles...

1070
00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:54,877
Charles Randall.

1071
00:57:54,919 --> 00:57:58,005
Yeah, Charles Randall... he did it.

1072
00:57:58,047 --> 00:58:00,841
Why are you telling us this?

1073
00:58:00,883 --> 00:58:04,011
Because he got off for that.
He was acquitted at trial.

1074
00:58:04,053 --> 00:58:06,263
- Because?
- Because?

1075
00:58:08,056 --> 00:58:10,350
I testified for him.

1076
00:58:10,392 --> 00:58:13,228
- You did what?
- I said he was with me.

1077
00:58:14,771 --> 00:58:18,482
You see, Cheryl here is
a very forgiving person,

1078
00:58:18,524 --> 00:58:20,818
unlike us hard-asses.

1079
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:23,112
- He threatened to kill me.
- Okay, Cheryl.

1080
00:58:23,153 --> 00:58:26,615
Now you say goodbye
to the nice officers

1081
00:58:26,657 --> 00:58:30,493
and you go on back home.

1082
00:58:30,535 --> 00:58:33,329
Don't drink yourself to death.

1083
00:58:35,456 --> 00:58:37,959
Okay, so...

1084
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,377
eh?

1085
00:58:43,297 --> 00:58:46,008
I want to hear you say it.

1086
00:58:46,049 --> 00:58:48,635
Come on, say it.

1087
00:58:53,097 --> 00:58:57,101
We planted the gun
in Randall's apartment, okay?

1088
00:58:57,143 --> 00:58:59,478
I said it. Happy?

1089
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:01,105
- Thank you.
- Yes, I am.

1090
00:59:01,147 --> 00:59:03,899
I'd do it again if I had to
'cause that fucking maggot

1091
00:59:03,941 --> 00:59:07,736
could rot away for all eternity.
I'd sleep just fine.

1092
00:59:07,778 --> 00:59:09,196
So what do you want from us?

1093
00:59:09,196 --> 00:59:11,698
You guys think
my partner's a serial killer.

1094
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:13,533
You're way off.

1095
00:59:13,575 --> 00:59:16,661
You like Turk for this thing?
Go have your fun.

1096
00:59:16,702 --> 00:59:19,080
I'll go along with you.

1097
00:59:19,121 --> 00:59:21,665
I'll even help you.

1098
00:59:21,707 --> 00:59:25,377
But do not drag up Chuck Randall
and that fucking gun,

1099
00:59:25,419 --> 00:59:28,880
because if he walks out of jail
he's gonna end up dead.

1100
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,966
Excuse me?

1101
00:59:32,550 --> 00:59:35,970
I'll put two
through his fucking head

1102
00:59:36,012 --> 00:59:38,556
myself.

1103
00:59:38,598 --> 00:59:40,891
Done deal.

1104
00:59:40,891 --> 00:59:44,019
(soprano singing)

1105
00:59:53,903 --> 00:59:56,864
My grandmother loved opera.

1106
00:59:56,906 --> 00:59:58,908
She supported us by sewing.

1107
00:59:58,949 --> 01:00:02,036
I used to thread needles
for my grandmother.

1108
01:00:02,119 --> 01:00:04,413
- Gave all her money to church.
- You admired her?

1109
01:00:04,455 --> 01:00:06,581
I worshipped her.

1110
01:00:06,623 --> 01:00:09,417
Rooster? Yeah, he's religious,
goes to church.

1111
01:00:09,459 --> 01:00:11,127
Prosky: How about you?

1112
01:00:11,169 --> 01:00:14,756
Turk's voice: Our job is keeping
99% of the population safe

1113
01:00:14,797 --> 01:00:18,259
from the other 1%.

1114
01:00:18,301 --> 01:00:21,887
The problem is that we have to
spend half our lives with that 1%.

1115
01:00:21,929 --> 01:00:23,722
And the better we do that job,

1116
01:00:23,764 --> 01:00:26,308
the less the other 99% think
they need us.

1117
01:00:26,350 --> 01:00:28,977
They're clueless.

1118
01:00:29,019 --> 01:00:30,979
The only ones paying attention
on the street

1119
01:00:30,979 --> 01:00:33,398
are the cops and the criminals.
Everyone else is just

1120
01:00:33,439 --> 01:00:36,192
going somewhere
or shopping.

1121
01:00:41,822 --> 01:00:44,032
- Umpire: Out.
- Come on.

1122
01:00:44,074 --> 01:00:46,576
I got an order here placing you
on restricted duty.

1123
01:00:46,618 --> 01:00:49,120
Now in plain English that means
you'll work at your desk.

1124
01:00:49,162 --> 01:00:51,206
You might want to cooperate
with the shrink

1125
01:00:51,247 --> 01:00:54,000
next time you two meet,
and you will meet again.

1126
01:00:57,962 --> 01:01:00,881
Cool my fucking heels.
Cool my fucking heels, huh?

1127
01:01:00,923 --> 01:01:03,634
I'm gonna blow a fucking hole
in that motherfucker Perez

1128
01:01:03,675 --> 01:01:06,553
and blow right through his head
for putting me through this bullshit.

1129
01:01:06,595 --> 01:01:08,513
- Turk.
- Fuck, I'm gonna...

1130
01:01:08,513 --> 01:01:09,848
kill that motherfucker.

1131
01:01:09,848 --> 01:01:12,684
Calm down. What the hell is it?
You're making all the wrong moves.

1132
01:01:12,684 --> 01:01:14,519
What are you talking about?
This ain't a chess game, partner.

1133
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:17,021
Who knows? Maybe it is.
You go at Perez now...

1134
01:01:17,021 --> 01:01:19,523
you know what's gonna happen?
You're gonna walk right into a trap.

1135
01:01:19,565 --> 01:01:21,734
You are.
They're just waiting for you.

1136
01:01:21,775 --> 01:01:23,485
Fucking Hingis.

1137
01:01:23,527 --> 01:01:25,779
Fucking Hingis believes him.

1138
01:01:25,821 --> 01:01:28,824
He actually fucking believes
that motherfucking Perez.

1139
01:01:28,865 --> 01:01:30,325
Stay back. Wait.

1140
01:01:30,367 --> 01:01:33,828
Wait for the right time,
then fire away.

1141
01:01:33,870 --> 01:01:35,705
Not now. Now is not the right time.

1142
01:01:35,747 --> 01:01:38,040
Believe me.

1143
01:01:38,082 --> 01:01:40,418
You believe me?
Now is not the time.

1144
01:01:40,459 --> 01:01:41,544
Uh-huh.

1145
01:01:41,585 --> 01:01:43,712
- Please.
- Yeah.

1146
01:01:43,754 --> 01:01:47,549
Hey, Turk, I gotta skip tonight.
My class ran late.

1147
01:01:47,591 --> 01:01:49,968
(over phone) But I'll see you
tomorrow, all right?

1148
01:01:50,010 --> 01:01:52,887
And I'm sorry about what happened
with you and Lieutenant Hingis today.

1149
01:01:52,929 --> 01:01:55,056
It's gonna be fine.
It'll blow over.

1150
01:01:55,098 --> 01:01:58,059
People are just... everyone's crazy.
People are overreacting.

1151
01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:00,728
All right? Good night.

1152
01:02:06,984 --> 01:02:09,152
It's a cop, it's a cop, it's a cop.

1153
01:02:15,950 --> 01:02:18,244
(car engine starts)

1154
01:02:18,286 --> 01:02:20,704
What you got for me, good-looking?

1155
01:02:25,918 --> 01:02:28,962
Mark my words, there's a reason
Perez is gunning for me.

1156
01:02:29,004 --> 01:02:31,756
- (tenor singing)
- Perez is too smart to be that stupid.

1157
01:02:31,798 --> 01:02:34,425
For one thing, all that college-boy crap...
that's bullshit.

1158
01:02:34,467 --> 01:02:36,677
He did one year at SUNY,
only one year.

1159
01:02:36,719 --> 01:02:37,720
No kidding.

1160
01:02:37,762 --> 01:02:40,139
They threw him out...
disruptive influence.

1161
01:02:40,181 --> 01:02:42,891
And I hear from the 240 he mixed it up bad
with a captain over there.

1162
01:02:42,933 --> 01:02:45,143
The guy is a total
fucking asshole.

1163
01:02:45,185 --> 01:02:47,020
(man with Russian accent)
BMW 3 series,

1164
01:02:47,062 --> 01:02:49,397
Mercedes CLK... too light.

1165
01:02:49,439 --> 01:02:52,400
BMW 7 series...
the biggest engine.

1166
01:02:52,442 --> 01:02:55,111
That's what you have to get.
If they shoot at you,

1167
01:02:55,153 --> 01:02:57,947
you still want
to get the fuck out of there...

1168
01:02:57,989 --> 01:02:59,615
(men laughing)

1169
01:02:59,657 --> 01:03:01,492
(imitating)
Bentley... very good

1170
01:03:01,534 --> 01:03:04,328
because can fuck two prostitutes
in back seat

1171
01:03:04,328 --> 01:03:08,081
and mount flame-thrower
on the hood. Da?

1172
01:03:08,123 --> 01:03:09,457
Da.

1173
01:03:09,499 --> 01:03:11,835
- Man: What about a Cadillac?
- Russian: Come on,

1174
01:03:11,835 --> 01:03:15,338
the fucking car can't turn
fucking corner. Are you kidding me?

1175
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:17,215
You know either one of those
Neanderthals?

1176
01:03:17,256 --> 01:03:20,009
The wop is Joe Scianci from Bensonhurst.
He's a mid-level guy.

1177
01:03:20,050 --> 01:03:22,011
What about lvan?

1178
01:03:22,052 --> 01:03:23,846
Russian guy,
Yevgeny Magulat,

1179
01:03:23,887 --> 01:03:28,016
an enforcer for the Italians,
works with Gambinos a lot.

1180
01:03:29,226 --> 01:03:31,019
(speaking Russian)

1181
01:03:32,479 --> 01:03:35,148
That shit's getting to me.

1182
01:03:35,189 --> 01:03:37,191
I know it's getting to you.

1183
01:03:38,943 --> 01:03:41,403
Shit gets to me too, you know,

1184
01:03:41,403 --> 01:03:44,531
but I take it in, I let it out
on my own terms.

1185
01:03:46,116 --> 01:03:48,201
I bet you didn't write
one word down

1186
01:03:48,243 --> 01:03:50,120
in that little notebook
Prosky gave us.

1187
01:03:50,161 --> 01:03:52,705
Of course not. Did you?

1188
01:03:52,747 --> 01:03:55,083
Yeah, it's great.

1189
01:03:56,667 --> 01:03:59,045
It helps me put things in perspective.

1190
01:03:59,086 --> 01:04:03,048
You know what I'm saying?
Write it down, get it out.

1191
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:05,634
- You should try this.
- Let's have a look.

1192
01:04:05,676 --> 01:04:08,303
What, are you kidding me?
Oh, come on, come on.

1193
01:04:08,345 --> 01:04:10,805
This belongs to me... private.

1194
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:15,226
- You don't want to let me see?
- Close to my heart. No, sir.

1195
01:04:15,268 --> 01:04:17,436
I just got sick
of the whole fucking game...

1196
01:04:17,478 --> 01:04:19,939
run around looking for clues,
making arrests,

1197
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:22,524
write reports, testify, cut deals.

1198
01:04:22,566 --> 01:04:25,444
It was all just so much
fucking bullshit.

1199
01:04:25,485 --> 01:04:28,321
(man whistles)

1200
01:04:28,363 --> 01:04:29,531
Detective...

1201
01:04:29,573 --> 01:04:31,574
(muffled gunshots)

1202
01:04:35,286 --> 01:04:36,662
Then it all got real simple.

1203
01:04:36,704 --> 01:04:39,749
Yeah, detective Perez here.
Hey, brother, what's up?

1204
01:04:39,790 --> 01:04:42,710
I hate scumbags. I like shooting people.
What was I giving up?

1205
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:45,754
Perez: Hey, look, I set the meeting up
with Rooster first thing tomorrow.

1206
01:04:45,796 --> 01:04:49,174
Come on, you gotta be fast, man.
I don't want Turk getting wind of anything.

1207
01:04:49,216 --> 01:04:51,593
A retirement party and a gold watch?

1208
01:04:51,634 --> 01:04:54,429
A handshake from the mayor
and my name on some fucking plaque?

1209
01:04:54,470 --> 01:04:57,181
(speaking indistinctly)

1210
01:04:57,223 --> 01:05:00,643
(gunshots)

1211
01:05:00,684 --> 01:05:01,852
Big fucking deal.

1212
01:05:04,104 --> 01:05:05,105
It's better this way.

1213
01:05:06,940 --> 01:05:09,776
Now everybody knows
who I was and where I stood.

1214
01:05:49,813 --> 01:05:51,481
(dials)

1215
01:05:53,233 --> 01:05:55,234
Hey, it's me.

1216
01:05:56,736 --> 01:06:00,197
Listen, I think somebody
followed me here... home.

1217
01:06:00,239 --> 01:06:02,700
He's outside right now.

1218
01:06:02,741 --> 01:06:06,411
Can you come over or...?

1219
01:06:06,453 --> 01:06:09,539
Just call me back, okay?
All right.

1220
01:06:24,803 --> 01:06:27,264
(intercom buzzing)

1221
01:06:34,937 --> 01:06:36,939
(cocks gun)

1222
01:06:39,692 --> 01:06:42,069
Don't move.

1223
01:06:54,956 --> 01:06:57,959
- Come on, open up.
- Turk?

1224
01:07:03,213 --> 01:07:05,382
I just called you.

1225
01:07:05,424 --> 01:07:07,009
Put the gun down.

1226
01:07:07,050 --> 01:07:09,052
There's a car following me.

1227
01:07:09,094 --> 01:07:11,846
Put the gun down.
Put the gun down.

1228
01:07:15,767 --> 01:07:17,268
Have you got
something to tell me?

1229
01:07:17,310 --> 01:07:19,103
About what?

1230
01:07:19,145 --> 01:07:21,689
Trager, Randall.

1231
01:07:21,730 --> 01:07:23,732
Did you sneak
into my apartment?

1232
01:07:23,774 --> 01:07:25,776
What are they doing
on your computer?

1233
01:07:25,817 --> 01:07:28,028
I was checking
all the links in the case.

1234
01:07:31,364 --> 01:07:33,074
Are you hiding something
from me?

1235
01:07:36,327 --> 01:07:37,870
Huh?

1236
01:07:39,372 --> 01:07:42,249
I just received this... this poem.

1237
01:07:42,291 --> 01:07:44,877
A poem?
Not worth mentioning, huh?

1238
01:07:44,918 --> 01:07:47,462
The handwriting
doesn't even match.

1239
01:07:47,504 --> 01:07:49,673
It's a fake.

1240
01:07:49,714 --> 01:07:51,716
Did you write it?

1241
01:07:53,551 --> 01:07:56,137
Did you write it?

1242
01:08:00,349 --> 01:08:02,893
What the hell is going on here?

1243
01:08:02,935 --> 01:08:05,103
You're spending a lot of time
with Perez, aren't you?

1244
01:08:05,145 --> 01:08:07,022
Yeah, I've been working the case.

1245
01:08:07,064 --> 01:08:09,191
What, are you jealous?

1246
01:08:09,232 --> 01:08:12,026
Can I trust you?

1247
01:08:14,153 --> 01:08:16,906
- Yes.
- Okay.

1248
01:08:16,906 --> 01:08:19,367
Get me anything and everything
that you can find out

1249
01:08:19,408 --> 01:08:21,827
about Perez or Riley,
what they know about me.

1250
01:08:23,579 --> 01:08:25,414
Everything.

1251
01:08:25,455 --> 01:08:27,916
Karen, don't play me.

1252
01:08:29,167 --> 01:08:32,837
Hingis: I am leaning much further
into saying that it is a cop.

1253
01:08:32,879 --> 01:08:36,215
Perez: Tell you what... I'm moving
past the leaning stage

1254
01:08:36,257 --> 01:08:39,051
and I'm moving towards the
l-know-for-sure-it's-a-fucking-cop stage,

1255
01:08:39,093 --> 01:08:41,428
considering how expertly
he shot the shit out of my house.

1256
01:08:41,470 --> 01:08:43,722
Hingis: Oh my God.
Are you hurt?

1257
01:08:43,764 --> 01:08:45,849
Am I hurt? Am I hurt?
He wants to know if I'm hurt.

1258
01:08:45,891 --> 01:08:47,434
Actually, he's dead.

1259
01:08:47,434 --> 01:08:50,103
(sirens wailing)

1260
01:08:50,145 --> 01:08:53,439
- Rooster: His name is Magulat.
- Turk: The guy we saw at Salerno's.

1261
01:08:53,481 --> 01:08:56,567
Yeah, he's in intensive care
at St. Luke's.

1262
01:08:56,609 --> 01:08:58,611
They think he's the guy

1263
01:08:58,653 --> 01:09:01,113
- chopped off Yakov Pearlstein's head.
- What do you think?

1264
01:09:01,155 --> 01:09:03,365
You think he's a victim,
or could he be our suspect?

1265
01:09:03,407 --> 01:09:06,451
I don't know, but either way
I think it's gonna be fun.

1266
01:09:07,494 --> 01:09:10,372
Doctor, what's the story?

1267
01:09:10,413 --> 01:09:13,416
He's one of the toughest human beings
I've ever come into contact with.

1268
01:09:13,458 --> 01:09:15,209
We took six bullets
out of him.

1269
01:09:15,251 --> 01:09:17,128
Six? Whoo!

1270
01:09:17,170 --> 01:09:19,922
Three from the night he was wounded,
three from previous shootings.

1271
01:09:19,964 --> 01:09:21,840
The man is a tank.

1272
01:09:21,882 --> 01:09:23,967
Do you mind if I talk to him
a little bit?

1273
01:09:24,009 --> 01:09:26,637
His jaw's wired shut,
but go ahead.

1274
01:09:26,678 --> 01:09:29,556
That's okay. I'll ask the questions.
He can just grunt.

1275
01:09:29,598 --> 01:09:32,517
Hey, Yevgeny.

1276
01:09:32,559 --> 01:09:34,811
(snapping fingers)
Wake up.

1277
01:09:34,852 --> 01:09:39,523
That's it. Wake up,
you big fucking grizzly bear.

1278
01:09:39,565 --> 01:09:41,984
You don't speak Russian?

1279
01:09:42,026 --> 01:09:45,612
Swoboda. Swoboda. Swoboda.

1280
01:09:45,654 --> 01:09:48,156
Ron.

1281
01:09:50,742 --> 01:09:52,911
(moans)

1282
01:09:52,952 --> 01:09:56,205
I'm thinking this Russian killing machine
could be our first eyewitness.

1283
01:09:56,205 --> 01:09:58,916
(beeping more rapidly)

1284
01:09:58,958 --> 01:10:01,835
Wake up, gugumuck.
You can tell us who did this to you.

1285
01:10:06,089 --> 01:10:09,509
- (grunting)
- Detective, I think that's enough.

1286
01:10:09,551 --> 01:10:13,012
Then you could tell us where you put
Yakov Pearlstein's head.

1287
01:10:14,389 --> 01:10:16,349
(laughs)

1288
01:10:16,432 --> 01:10:19,310
4-3, 4-3, I need a round-the-clock
security detail

1289
01:10:19,352 --> 01:10:23,605
on a patient Magulat,
M-A-gulat,

1290
01:10:23,647 --> 01:10:25,857
St. Luke's in the ICU.

1291
01:10:27,692 --> 01:10:31,571
#I wake up in the morning... #

1292
01:10:31,613 --> 01:10:34,866
Is this the number to call
to report a case of police brutality?

1293
01:10:34,907 --> 01:10:38,369
- Cat got your tongue?
- Out on bail again?

1294
01:10:38,411 --> 01:10:40,663
What, you think you can scare me,
little bitch? What do you want?

1295
01:10:40,704 --> 01:10:43,040
Be careful, detective.
My taxes pay your salary.

1296
01:10:43,082 --> 01:10:45,667
You don't pay any fucking taxes,
you lowlife piece of shit.

1297
01:10:45,709 --> 01:10:48,086
- Get to the point, come on.
- One of your vics, Trager,

1298
01:10:48,128 --> 01:10:50,755
stole a whole lot of guns
down South.

1299
01:10:50,797 --> 01:10:52,882
Same guns are turning up
on your murder scenes.

1300
01:10:52,924 --> 01:10:54,217
So it's simple...

1301
01:10:54,259 --> 01:10:56,761
find stolen guns,
you got your guy.

1302
01:10:56,803 --> 01:10:58,638
So you know the guy?

1303
01:10:58,679 --> 01:11:01,473
Do you know if there's a cop out there
who might be a danger to the public?

1304
01:11:01,515 --> 01:11:04,268
I couldn't live with myself
if I just stood by and didn't say anything.

1305
01:11:04,309 --> 01:11:07,312
Look, I'm gonna give you
two seconds more. Give me yes or no.

1306
01:11:07,354 --> 01:11:10,315
Do you know the guy?
And when do I meet you to talk about it?

1307
01:11:10,315 --> 01:11:13,067
Friday, 9:00 PM, at my club.

1308
01:11:13,109 --> 01:11:14,277
I'll be there.

1309
01:11:14,319 --> 01:11:16,320
Man, there's dumb
and there's dumber,

1310
01:11:16,362 --> 01:11:18,823
but this is the motherfucking dumbest
right here, man.

1311
01:11:18,864 --> 01:11:21,033
Easy, son, easy.
It's gonna be easy for you.

1312
01:11:21,075 --> 01:11:24,661
All you gotta do is be bait, that's all.
Be a little sardine for us, all right?

1313
01:11:24,703 --> 01:11:27,372
You help us... we got you covered.
Your club doesn't get hassled

1314
01:11:27,414 --> 01:11:29,958
and you don't have a revolving door
in and out of jail.

1315
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,584
Do we have a deal or not?

1316
01:11:31,626 --> 01:11:35,004
Yeah, but your boy come in here
and go Hannibal Lecter on my ass,

1317
01:11:35,046 --> 01:11:37,590
I don't want no Jodie fucking Foster
coming through the door.

1318
01:11:37,632 --> 01:11:39,467
I want the goddamn
Marine Corps, man.

1319
01:11:39,508 --> 01:11:43,137
#Since Color Me Badd was singing
"I wanna sex you up"...#

1320
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:49,351
(footsteps)

1321
01:11:59,819 --> 01:12:01,820
(heart monitor beeping)

1322
01:12:12,163 --> 01:12:13,665
Evening, detective.

1323
01:12:13,706 --> 01:12:16,918
You want one? It's shit,
but it's better than nothing, right?

1324
01:12:16,918 --> 01:12:20,129
Turk's voice: As soon as I heard
the fucking Russian didn't die

1325
01:12:20,171 --> 01:12:22,423
I knew things would never
be the same.

1326
01:12:22,464 --> 01:12:24,633
I had to change the rules,

1327
01:12:24,675 --> 01:12:26,677
the strategy.

1328
01:12:26,718 --> 01:12:30,472
I had to be bold, do something
that could never be undone.

1329
01:12:38,312 --> 01:12:40,606
I went for the unforgivable.

1330
01:13:01,792 --> 01:13:03,794
(Karen grunting)

1331
01:13:07,714 --> 01:13:10,425
No. Please. No.

1332
01:13:12,552 --> 01:13:14,971
(crying)

1333
01:13:32,445 --> 01:13:35,323
Karen over phone: Did you hear
anything I just said?

1334
01:13:36,491 --> 01:13:40,202
How exactly could I be
blowing this out of proportion?

1335
01:13:40,244 --> 01:13:42,413
That psycho just assaulted me.

1336
01:13:42,454 --> 01:13:45,749
I am telling you
he is a classic sociopath.

1337
01:13:45,791 --> 01:13:47,918
Okay okay,
I'll look into it, all right?

1338
01:13:47,959 --> 01:13:49,461
I'll look into it.

1339
01:13:49,502 --> 01:13:51,671
You stay the hell away from here.
Understood?

1340
01:13:51,713 --> 01:13:53,506
Understood?

1341
01:13:55,550 --> 01:13:56,884
Fuck that.

1342
01:14:08,311 --> 01:14:10,605
Man: Check the ball,
check the ball.

1343
01:14:10,647 --> 01:14:12,065
(players chattering)

1344
01:14:12,107 --> 01:14:15,360
I got the ball. I got the ball. I got the ball.
Stay on him. Stay on him.

1345
01:14:15,401 --> 01:14:17,320
Karen: Excuse me,
I'm detective Corelli.

1346
01:14:17,361 --> 01:14:20,281
- I need to see your reservation book.
- Woman: Sure. Help yourself.

1347
01:14:27,746 --> 01:14:29,956
- Thank you.
- Anytime.

1348
01:14:29,998 --> 01:14:31,708
Yes, this is detective Corelli.

1349
01:14:31,750 --> 01:14:34,168
I've been trying to reach
detectives Perez and Riley

1350
01:14:34,210 --> 01:14:36,129
and I can't seem
to locate them.

1351
01:14:36,170 --> 01:14:39,173
- Perez: I like to party.
- That's nothing. I was into Kiss.

1352
01:14:39,215 --> 01:14:41,217
I used to run
around the house

1353
01:14:41,258 --> 01:14:43,385
with my tongue hanging out,
spitting fake blood.

1354
01:14:43,427 --> 01:14:44,720
I need to speak to them
urgently.

1355
01:14:44,761 --> 01:14:46,930
(police siren whooping)

1356
01:14:48,557 --> 01:14:51,935
Yes, I understand,
but I need the location, please.

1357
01:15:15,998 --> 01:15:17,291
(buzzes)

1358
01:15:20,503 --> 01:15:23,005
Hey, he's here.

1359
01:15:23,047 --> 01:15:24,256
Turk: Let me in.

1360
01:15:29,719 --> 01:15:29,803
Thank God it's the police.

1361
01:15:29,803 --> 01:15:32,013
Thank God it's the police.

1362
01:15:32,055 --> 01:15:34,390
Yeah, so where do we go?

1363
01:15:34,432 --> 01:15:36,350
Follow me.

1364
01:15:36,392 --> 01:15:38,686
I used to play ball
a couple of blocks from here.

1365
01:15:38,728 --> 01:15:39,979
Get the fuck out of here.

1366
01:15:40,020 --> 01:15:42,940
When I was a kid I wasn't afraid
to mix it up with guys like you.

1367
01:15:42,981 --> 01:15:44,274
You still ain't.

1368
01:15:44,316 --> 01:15:46,818
Yeah, nowadays
I carry a gun with me.

1369
01:15:46,860 --> 01:15:50,155
It's a bad neighborhood.

1370
01:15:50,196 --> 01:15:52,157
- It ain't bad for me.
- Yeah, well...

1371
01:15:52,198 --> 01:15:54,617
Yeah, he's inside.

1372
01:15:54,659 --> 01:15:56,202
Well, so far so good.

1373
01:15:56,244 --> 01:15:58,829
So now that we're done with
the pleasantries, what do you got for me?

1374
01:15:58,871 --> 01:16:00,122
Rooster: He's talking.

1375
01:16:00,164 --> 01:16:02,166
- What did you think he was gonna do?
- Spider: How about an apology?

1376
01:16:02,207 --> 01:16:04,960
Spider: The shit that happened to Stubby,
that wasn't supposed to happen.

1377
01:16:05,002 --> 01:16:08,505
- Rooster: Lieutenant, that's a crock of shit.
- I lost three fucking teeth that day.

1378
01:16:08,547 --> 01:16:10,840
He's not a civilian.
He's a fucking dealer.

1379
01:16:10,882 --> 01:16:12,926
- And I kept my mouth shut.
- So what?

1380
01:16:12,967 --> 01:16:16,262
You guys love those stupid gold teeth.
You should thank me.

1381
01:16:16,304 --> 01:16:19,140
Well, he's wearing a vest
and Starsky and Hutch here

1382
01:16:19,181 --> 01:16:22,184
are watching him like a couple
of hawks... gay hawks.

1383
01:16:22,226 --> 01:16:25,395
- Yeah, right there, buddy.
- (chuckles)

1384
01:16:25,437 --> 01:16:28,398
All right, enough bullshit.
So you know our poetry boy?

1385
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:30,442
Just talk to me.
What do you got for me?

1386
01:16:30,483 --> 01:16:32,527
- All right, here we go.
- Here we go.

1387
01:16:32,569 --> 01:16:34,070
Would you please?

1388
01:16:34,070 --> 01:16:36,906
Just 'cause the guy's talking tough,
that don't mean shit.

1389
01:16:36,948 --> 01:16:38,741
Let me ask you something,
Copernicus.

1390
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:41,368
That gun on his belt...
do you think it's a service pistol?

1391
01:16:41,410 --> 01:16:44,079
I bet you we'll trace it back to Trager's.
What do you think about that?

1392
01:16:44,121 --> 01:16:45,872
- What do you want to bet?
- 500 bucks.

1393
01:16:45,914 --> 01:16:48,041
- You're on.
- I'm in for another five.

1394
01:16:48,083 --> 01:16:50,418
Oh, this is fun.

1395
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:52,670
Look, I help you,
you reciprocate.

1396
01:16:52,712 --> 01:16:54,172
So help me.

1397
01:16:54,213 --> 01:16:56,507
All right, you might see
a little bit of a cell-phone video.

1398
01:16:56,549 --> 01:16:58,592
I got it in front of Trager's
the night he bought it.

1399
01:16:58,634 --> 01:17:00,594
- You got what?
- I got a movie...

1400
01:17:00,636 --> 01:17:04,098
a couple of kids back from the prom,
preserving their special memories,

1401
01:17:04,139 --> 01:17:05,849
a positive Id of you, big time.

1402
01:17:05,891 --> 01:17:08,059
- Oh, yeah? Of me?
- Yeah.

1403
01:17:08,101 --> 01:17:09,811
Okay.

1404
01:17:09,853 --> 01:17:11,396
Now you know
what I'm talking about.

1405
01:17:11,438 --> 01:17:13,773
Yeah, now I got it.

1406
01:17:13,815 --> 01:17:15,775
Yeah, well,
so how do I look?

1407
01:17:18,819 --> 01:17:20,404
Like a poet?

1408
01:17:21,405 --> 01:17:23,073
'Cause that's what I am,
you know, a poet.

1409
01:17:23,115 --> 01:17:25,784
All right, come on, let's go.

1410
01:17:25,826 --> 01:17:28,453
In fact, I wrote a poem for you, Spider.
Want to hear it?

1411
01:17:28,495 --> 01:17:30,455
Eh?

1412
01:17:30,497 --> 01:17:32,707
(cocks gun)

1413
01:17:32,749 --> 01:17:34,292
(door crashes open)

1414
01:17:34,334 --> 01:17:37,795
Drop your gun right now, motherfucker!
Drop to the ground right now!

1415
01:17:37,837 --> 01:17:39,672
Oh! Oh! Grease me up and...

1416
01:17:39,713 --> 01:17:41,799
I mean, do they actually pay
you two morons?

1417
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:45,093
- Put the fucking weapon on the ground.
- Gladly. Gladly. Right there.

1418
01:17:45,135 --> 01:17:47,095
Right there. There you go.

1419
01:17:48,263 --> 01:17:50,181
Hey, you want to read my poem?

1420
01:17:50,181 --> 01:17:51,641
Easy easy.

1421
01:17:51,683 --> 01:17:52,976
Here, read it.

1422
01:17:55,144 --> 01:17:57,396
"You tried to set me up, you fucks,

1423
01:17:57,438 --> 01:17:59,231
And this is how you do it?

1424
01:17:59,273 --> 01:18:02,026
You thought I'd get
my dick cut off,

1425
01:18:02,026 --> 01:18:04,611
Instead you only blew it."

1426
01:18:04,653 --> 01:18:06,655
- (both laugh)
- Great stuff.

1427
01:18:06,697 --> 01:18:09,074
- What is that shit?
- Thank you.

1428
01:18:09,115 --> 01:18:11,534
That is poetry.

1429
01:18:11,576 --> 01:18:13,328
What are you doing here?

1430
01:18:13,369 --> 01:18:15,204
Well, don't look at me, partner,

1431
01:18:15,204 --> 01:18:17,707
but I tagged along
to protect your ass

1432
01:18:17,748 --> 01:18:21,085
and to see the look on their faces.
It was worth it.

1433
01:18:21,126 --> 01:18:23,504
We're doing our jobs here, okay?
I'm not gonna apologize for that.

1434
01:18:23,545 --> 01:18:26,173
I never want you to apologize, Teddy.
There's a killer out there with a badge.

1435
01:18:26,214 --> 01:18:28,383
- What are you morons doing about it?
- What do you think we're doing here?

1436
01:18:28,425 --> 01:18:30,260
- That's not it.
- No, that's not it.

1437
01:18:30,302 --> 01:18:32,220
I just made 1000 bucks.

1438
01:18:32,262 --> 01:18:34,097
Where's the other gun?
Give it to me.

1439
01:18:34,138 --> 01:18:35,932
Why don't you frisk me, Sherlock?
Go ahead.

1440
01:18:35,973 --> 01:18:38,184
- Frisk me, go ahead. Go ahead.
- Yeah, I'm gonna frisk you.

1441
01:18:41,270 --> 01:18:43,897
Ooh, nice touch, Mary.

1442
01:18:43,939 --> 01:18:46,108
What are you doing after work?
Unless you're committed.

1443
01:18:46,149 --> 01:18:48,401
I don't want to get
in the middle of anything.

1444
01:18:48,443 --> 01:18:51,654
What happened to your face?
Your mick friend give you a little love bite?

1445
01:18:51,696 --> 01:18:55,074
- Shut the fuck up. Shut your fucking face.
- Hey hey hey! Whoa!

1446
01:18:55,116 --> 01:18:57,827
I'll blow your brains out
if you don't get the fuck away.

1447
01:18:57,868 --> 01:19:00,037
- What's he talking about?
- (all yelling)

1448
01:19:00,079 --> 01:19:01,872
- What's he talking about?
- What he's talking about is,

1449
01:19:01,914 --> 01:19:04,249
just 'cause you didn't go for this
doesn't mean you're not our guy.

1450
01:19:04,291 --> 01:19:06,626
- Now we gotta break this shit up.
- Don't translate for me, man.

1451
01:19:06,668 --> 01:19:09,296
Rooster: Will you let this go?
You fucked up, okay?

1452
01:19:09,337 --> 01:19:11,881
- We fucked up 'cause you helped him.
- I'm gonna nail your ass.

1453
01:19:11,923 --> 01:19:14,300
I'm not through with you, man.
Make a mistake.

1454
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:16,302
Rooster: I'm gonna
break this stuff down, okay?

1455
01:19:16,344 --> 01:19:18,596
You fucking dog.

1456
01:19:20,139 --> 01:19:22,891
Relax, Spider.

1457
01:19:22,933 --> 01:19:25,269
Come on, let's have a drink.

1458
01:19:25,310 --> 01:19:28,855
I saw what I think
is a refrigerator here.

1459
01:19:33,067 --> 01:19:34,736
I'll be back in a second.

1460
01:19:43,660 --> 01:19:45,162
Hey, muffinhead.

1461
01:19:48,373 --> 01:19:49,833
Is this the person
who shot you?

1462
01:19:50,834 --> 01:19:52,794
You're sure?

1463
01:19:56,506 --> 01:19:58,466
(chuckles)

1464
01:19:58,507 --> 01:20:00,551
No, you're the pumpkinhead.

1465
01:20:05,889 --> 01:20:07,891
(Spider chuckling)

1466
01:20:11,811 --> 01:20:13,771
You miss me?

1467
01:20:15,815 --> 01:20:18,150
"...of death and pain,

1468
01:20:18,192 --> 01:20:20,361
Place oneself among the slain.

1469
01:20:20,402 --> 01:20:22,905
If one addiction goes unfed,

1470
01:20:22,946 --> 01:20:25,240
The world is better with him dead."

1471
01:20:43,841 --> 01:20:45,050
Take it easy.

1472
01:20:45,092 --> 01:20:46,885
It's okay.
It's gonna be all right.

1473
01:20:46,927 --> 01:20:49,137
Jesus Christ, Rooster.

1474
01:20:49,179 --> 01:20:52,056
Just move into the room. Here.

1475
01:20:52,098 --> 01:20:54,559
Sit down. Sit down.

1476
01:20:57,436 --> 01:20:59,438
Okay.

1477
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:03,192
You gotta know about this,
Tom, from me.

1478
01:21:03,233 --> 01:21:06,320
Now just open that little book,
start reading.

1479
01:21:06,361 --> 01:21:08,822
Everything you want to know
is in there.

1480
01:21:10,865 --> 01:21:12,867
So go ahead.

1481
01:21:14,452 --> 01:21:16,412
Out loud.

1482
01:21:17,788 --> 01:21:19,874
For the record.

1483
01:21:19,915 --> 01:21:22,668
See the little video here?

1484
01:21:29,090 --> 01:21:32,469
"My name is david Fisk,
detective First Grade.

1485
01:21:32,469 --> 01:21:36,556
I've been a cop in the NYPd
for nearly 30 years."

1486
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:41,185
- Dave, dave, dave, dave.
- Tom,

1487
01:21:41,227 --> 01:21:44,313
we've got a lot to cover
and not much time to do it in, so...

1488
01:21:47,607 --> 01:21:50,819
"My name is david Fisk,
detective First Grade."

1489
01:21:50,819 --> 01:21:53,363
My name is david Fisk.

1490
01:21:53,404 --> 01:21:56,449
"I've been a cop in the NYPd
for nearly 30 years."

1491
01:21:56,491 --> 01:21:59,326
I don't expect you
to remember me.

1492
01:21:59,368 --> 01:22:01,412
I mean, it's been a long time

1493
01:22:01,453 --> 01:22:05,249
since you sat me on your lap
and told me you loved me.

1494
01:22:05,290 --> 01:22:08,335
"In that time

1495
01:22:08,376 --> 01:22:11,129
I've killed 14 people."

1496
01:22:12,213 --> 01:22:14,215
Rooster: But I guarantee

1497
01:22:14,257 --> 01:22:17,426
you're gonna remember the name
for the rest of your life.

1498
01:22:27,936 --> 01:22:31,523
"You don't become a cop
because you want to serve and protect.

1499
01:22:32,982 --> 01:22:36,027
You join the force because they let you
carry a gun and a badge.

1500
01:22:36,068 --> 01:22:38,738
Most people respect the badge.

1501
01:22:38,779 --> 01:22:40,865
Everybody respects the gun."

1502
01:22:40,906 --> 01:22:43,742
I'm the killer.
I show up at your door.

1503
01:22:43,784 --> 01:22:46,620
Turk: What are you talking about?
It's not a fucking chess game.

1504
01:22:46,662 --> 01:22:49,748
Who knows? Maybe it is.
You're making all the wrong moves.

1505
01:22:49,789 --> 01:22:52,000
I'm gonna put two
through his fucking head

1506
01:22:52,041 --> 01:22:54,377
myself.

1507
01:22:54,419 --> 01:22:56,546
I know it to a moral certainty.

1508
01:22:56,587 --> 01:22:59,131
You sort of get numb to it.

1509
01:23:08,682 --> 01:23:11,434
"Tom Cowen was my role model.

1510
01:23:21,485 --> 01:23:23,779
The day I stopped trying to be him

1511
01:23:23,821 --> 01:23:26,156
was the greatest day of my life.

1512
01:23:30,201 --> 01:23:33,496
Several years back I framed
a lowlife child killer

1513
01:23:33,538 --> 01:23:36,207
named Charles Randall.

1514
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,377
I should have known
it would come back to haunt me."

1515
01:23:44,590 --> 01:23:46,967
What do you want me
to do with this?

1516
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:51,179
Is that all you got to say?

1517
01:23:51,221 --> 01:23:53,473
I owe you this explanation, pal.

1518
01:23:53,514 --> 01:23:55,516
Why are you telling me now?

1519
01:23:55,558 --> 01:23:59,895
Lvan the Terrible
is gonna wake up pretty soon

1520
01:23:59,937 --> 01:24:01,730
and he's gonna Id me.

1521
01:24:07,319 --> 01:24:09,154
Evening, detective.

1522
01:24:09,196 --> 01:24:12,157
You want one? It's shit,
but it's better than nothing, right?

1523
01:24:12,198 --> 01:24:16,327
I can just walk right in here.
Your partner's asleep. Step outside.

1524
01:24:16,369 --> 01:24:19,205
Did I ever pick
the wrong fucking Russki to shoot?

1525
01:24:28,588 --> 01:24:31,007
Now we're going off the record.

1526
01:24:33,551 --> 01:24:37,346
Uh, I'm going to take the rap
for the Randall gun thing.

1527
01:24:37,388 --> 01:24:39,223
You saw that.

1528
01:24:39,223 --> 01:24:42,393
I mean, considering
the circumstances, why not?

1529
01:24:42,434 --> 01:24:44,895
No need to thank me.

1530
01:24:46,104 --> 01:24:48,064
That business about not being me...

1531
01:24:48,064 --> 01:24:49,566
Yeah.

1532
01:24:49,608 --> 01:24:51,568
I don't get that.

1533
01:24:51,609 --> 01:24:55,613
Well, you're a great cop, Tom.

1534
01:24:55,655 --> 01:24:57,657
I mean, you were the one

1535
01:24:57,698 --> 01:25:00,743
I aspired to all my life
and could never be.

1536
01:25:02,328 --> 01:25:04,746
Then you broke the law,

1537
01:25:04,746 --> 01:25:07,916
planted the gun on Randall,

1538
01:25:07,958 --> 01:25:11,252
let me down.

1539
01:25:12,962 --> 01:25:14,922
I lost my faith.

1540
01:25:16,466 --> 01:25:20,427
That's when it all started.

1541
01:25:20,469 --> 01:25:23,138
And once it did,

1542
01:25:23,180 --> 01:25:25,224
I couldn't stop.

1543
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:30,270
Finally,

1544
01:25:30,312 --> 01:25:32,814
I didn't want to.

1545
01:25:39,236 --> 01:25:42,781
So I did my own thing.

1546
01:25:42,823 --> 01:25:45,450
And you know what? In the end

1547
01:25:45,492 --> 01:25:47,786
it got done.

1548
01:25:47,828 --> 01:25:50,330
The scum went down.

1549
01:25:50,372 --> 01:25:52,248
And that's it. That's that.

1550
01:25:53,791 --> 01:25:56,085
I don't understand
a word you said,

1551
01:25:56,127 --> 01:25:58,296
- don't understand any of it.
- I know you don't, Tom.

1552
01:25:58,337 --> 01:26:01,006
As soon as I heard
the Russian didn't die

1553
01:26:01,048 --> 01:26:03,425
I knew I had to change the rules,

1554
01:26:03,467 --> 01:26:06,303
do something that could
never be undone.

1555
01:26:06,345 --> 01:26:08,388
I went for the unforgivable.

1556
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:13,643
No.

1557
01:26:15,103 --> 01:26:17,355
So what am I gonna do, my friend,

1558
01:26:17,396 --> 01:26:20,024
partner? Arrest you?

1559
01:26:20,065 --> 01:26:22,943
At some point I gotta call it in.

1560
01:26:22,985 --> 01:26:24,361
We're a team.

1561
01:26:24,403 --> 01:26:26,113
We were.

1562
01:26:26,154 --> 01:26:28,156
Yeah, we were, a great team.

1563
01:26:28,198 --> 01:26:30,659
That was yesterday, dave.

1564
01:26:30,700 --> 01:26:31,826
Today...

1565
01:26:33,953 --> 01:26:36,914
today you're pointing a gun at me.

1566
01:26:41,377 --> 01:26:44,505
(cocks gun)
But it hasn't gone off yet.

1567
01:26:49,884 --> 01:26:51,344
Bye, Tom.

1568
01:26:51,386 --> 01:26:53,513
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.

1569
01:26:53,555 --> 01:26:56,557
To hell, I suppose.

1570
01:27:43,225 --> 01:27:45,269
- Hey, dave, dave.
- Whoa.

1571
01:27:45,310 --> 01:27:47,854
Don't come closer!

1572
01:27:47,896 --> 01:27:50,231
- You wouldn't.
- You want to bet your life on it?

1573
01:27:50,273 --> 01:27:52,233
Come on, partner, I know you.
You wouldn't.

1574
01:27:52,275 --> 01:27:54,652
(Karen cocks gun)
But I would.

1575
01:27:54,652 --> 01:27:55,903
Oh.

1576
01:27:55,945 --> 01:27:57,947
Karen, just take it easy.

1577
01:27:57,989 --> 01:27:59,990
- Can't get me out of your mind?
- Shut up, dave.

1578
01:28:00,032 --> 01:28:04,077
You're gonna defend
this lowlife piece of shit?

1579
01:28:04,119 --> 01:28:07,039
- Boy, I'm in your head.
- I'm not defending him. Take it easy.

1580
01:28:07,080 --> 01:28:10,250
Fuck you, Turk.
Put the gun down, Fisk.

1581
01:28:10,292 --> 01:28:11,751
- And if I don't?
- Dave.

1582
01:28:11,793 --> 01:28:14,545
- How about I blow your brains out?
- Ooh, I like the sound of that.

1583
01:28:14,587 --> 01:28:16,506
- Don't move.
- Karen.

1584
01:28:16,547 --> 01:28:18,966
You blow me away, Turk dies.
Is that your idea?

1585
01:28:19,008 --> 01:28:20,342
I said don't move, you prick.

1586
01:28:20,342 --> 01:28:22,678
Bye-bye!

1587
01:28:24,346 --> 01:28:25,931
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun.

1588
01:28:27,599 --> 01:28:29,309
Stay here.

1589
01:28:36,065 --> 01:28:37,483
Oh, man.

1590
01:28:38,818 --> 01:28:40,069
Fuck.

1591
01:28:41,612 --> 01:28:43,530
- (train passing)
- These old locks...

1592
01:28:43,572 --> 01:28:45,240
I mean, they're good.

1593
01:28:45,282 --> 01:28:47,242
Dave, you've got to end
this thing.

1594
01:28:47,284 --> 01:28:49,327
End it?

1595
01:28:49,411 --> 01:28:50,704
Put the gun down.

1596
01:28:50,745 --> 01:28:53,539
What's your plan?

1597
01:28:53,581 --> 01:28:55,875
Are you gonna arrest me?

1598
01:28:55,917 --> 01:28:58,711
Are you gonna take me down
to the precinct, book me,

1599
01:28:58,753 --> 01:29:02,423
fingerprint me,
body-cavity-search me?

1600
01:29:02,464 --> 01:29:04,341
What the fuck
are you gonna do?

1601
01:29:04,383 --> 01:29:07,302
Wheel me out on the "Geraldo" show,
a freak of the week?

1602
01:29:07,344 --> 01:29:12,056
Or better yet, an in-depth
psycho profile on "Oprah"?

1603
01:29:12,098 --> 01:29:14,392
Are you ready for that?
It ain't gonna fly, man.

1604
01:29:14,434 --> 01:29:16,769
Dave, you give me no choice.

1605
01:29:16,811 --> 01:29:18,646
You got a choice... I escape.

1606
01:29:20,231 --> 01:29:22,483
Would you do that for me, Tom?

1607
01:29:23,609 --> 01:29:24,818
Would you let me escape?

1608
01:29:24,860 --> 01:29:26,403
Come on, don't do this.

1609
01:29:26,445 --> 01:29:28,780
I'm gonna make a run for it.

1610
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:30,990
What do you think?

1611
01:29:31,032 --> 01:29:34,035
You gotta do the right thing.

1612
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:42,084
That's a 10-10, partner...

1613
01:29:42,126 --> 01:29:45,504
shots fired, suspect fleeing.
Let's go!

1614
01:29:45,545 --> 01:29:47,172
Come on, don't go there.

1615
01:29:48,673 --> 01:29:51,760
Hey, partner, come on.
Shots fired.

1616
01:29:51,801 --> 01:29:54,220
- Don't do this.
- Suspect fleeing,

1617
01:29:54,262 --> 01:29:56,681
resisting arrest. Come on.

1618
01:30:06,106 --> 01:30:08,984
A righteous man

1619
01:30:09,025 --> 01:30:11,778
Before me stands,

1620
01:30:11,820 --> 01:30:16,157
A hero in these filthy lands.

1621
01:30:16,199 --> 01:30:19,618
A brother in arms,

1622
01:30:19,660 --> 01:30:23,122
In heart are you.

1623
01:30:23,163 --> 01:30:25,832
I was really hoping

1624
01:30:25,874 --> 01:30:28,502
You'd get it too.

1625
01:30:32,005 --> 01:30:34,549
- I do get it.
- No, you don't.

1626
01:30:34,590 --> 01:30:36,551
No, I get it.

1627
01:30:42,890 --> 01:30:46,143
You know, the only thing
in this life

1628
01:30:46,184 --> 01:30:49,020
that ever gave me
any satisfaction

1629
01:30:49,062 --> 01:30:50,939
was killing those fucks.

1630
01:30:52,899 --> 01:30:55,193
So this is for real.

1631
01:30:55,234 --> 01:30:57,612
I mean,

1632
01:30:57,653 --> 01:30:59,989
this one is bad.

1633
01:31:02,157 --> 01:31:03,784
10-13.

1634
01:31:04,785 --> 01:31:06,995
Officer down.

1635
01:31:07,037 --> 01:31:09,914
(train passing)

1636
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:33,686
I ain't going anywhere, Tom.

1637
01:31:33,728 --> 01:31:36,022
I ain't going anywhere.

1638
01:31:37,148 --> 01:31:39,984
It's okay.

1639
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:48,033
3-4 squad, Central.
3-4 squad, Central.

1640
01:31:48,074 --> 01:31:50,577
10-13, officer down.
184th and St. Nick's.

1641
01:31:50,618 --> 01:31:53,329
Officer down, 10-13.
Hurry hurry hurry.

1642
01:31:53,371 --> 01:31:56,040
- Dispatcher: 10-4, 4 squad...
- Tom, don't. Don't.

1643
01:31:56,082 --> 01:31:59,627
- Officer down. ETA six minutes.
- Don't.

1644
01:31:59,668 --> 01:32:02,296
Don't.

1645
01:32:14,515 --> 01:32:16,559
Don't.

1646
01:32:25,025 --> 01:32:27,110
3-4 squad, Central.

1647
01:32:27,152 --> 01:32:29,738
Dispatcher: Central.
Go ahead, 4 squad.

1648
01:32:29,779 --> 01:32:32,323
That's a 10-55 on the bus.
Cancel the ambulance.

1649
01:32:32,365 --> 01:32:34,325
Dispatcher: 10-5?

1650
01:32:34,367 --> 01:32:37,453
Turk: Cancel the ambulance.
10-55 on the bus. Cancel the ambulance.

1651
01:32:37,495 --> 01:32:40,164
- You sure on that?
- Sure on that.

1652
01:32:49,297 --> 01:32:51,674
You did this, you know.

1653
01:32:53,218 --> 01:32:56,679
I know, partner, I know.

1654
01:32:59,849 --> 01:33:01,684
We did good, Tom.

1655
01:33:02,893 --> 01:33:05,354
Tom, Tommy.

1656
01:33:05,395 --> 01:33:09,107
We did good. We did good.

1657
01:33:10,817 --> 01:33:13,570
You're a good man, Tom.

1658
01:33:13,570 --> 01:33:16,030
You're a good man.

1659
01:33:17,406 --> 01:33:20,409
I wish you...

1660
01:33:20,451 --> 01:33:22,745
I wish you

1661
01:33:22,786 --> 01:33:25,872
continued success.

1662
01:34:07,619 --> 01:34:09,788
Some piece of work, your partner.

1663
01:34:09,829 --> 01:34:11,790
Lights.

1664
01:34:11,831 --> 01:34:13,625
Look, Cowen,

1665
01:34:13,666 --> 01:34:16,335
the way we see it,

1666
01:34:16,377 --> 01:34:19,338
detective Fisk just closed the door
on the poetry boy.

1667
01:34:26,303 --> 01:34:29,472
Good. Whatever you say.

1668
01:34:32,308 --> 01:34:34,769
Are we done?

1669
01:34:34,811 --> 01:34:36,812
Yeah, we're done.

1670
01:34:42,693 --> 01:34:44,820
(children playing)

1671
01:34:58,916 --> 01:35:00,751
Turk's voice: My daughter called.

1672
01:35:00,793 --> 01:35:04,463
She was upset about Rooster
and worried about me.

1673
01:35:04,505 --> 01:35:08,049
She asked me if I was likely
to do something stupid

1674
01:35:08,091 --> 01:35:10,677
and I said, "Like what,

1675
01:35:10,719 --> 01:35:13,721
take anger management classes
or retire?"

1676
01:35:13,763 --> 01:35:17,058
I said I was gonna do
the same old thing I always do.

1677
01:35:17,058 --> 01:35:20,978
She said, "Good.
What else could you do?"

1678
01:35:21,020 --> 01:35:22,688
I said, "Right."

1679
01:35:22,730 --> 01:35:25,732
A real chip off the old block,
my daughter.

1680
01:35:25,774 --> 01:35:29,027
She said I was a cop
and a good one.

1681
01:35:29,069 --> 01:35:32,614
Funny... Rooster said
the same thing.

1682
01:35:35,741 --> 01:35:38,994
Turk: Okay, guys,
let's get ready to play ball.

1683
01:35:39,036 --> 01:35:42,873
On the count of three.
Everybody in?

1684
01:35:42,915 --> 01:35:46,460
One, two, three, explosion!

1685
01:35:59,138 --> 01:35:59,346
(instrumental music playing)

1686
01:35:59,346 --> 01:36:01,140
(instrumental music playing)
