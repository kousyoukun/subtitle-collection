0
00:01:22,295 --> 00:01:23,626
One

1
00:01:23,663 --> 00:01:25,096
between the eyes!

2
00:01:25,132 --> 00:01:27,259
Two

3
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,393
between the eyes.

4
00:01:58,365 --> 00:02:00,162
- Out!
- What?

5
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,504
- She was safe.
- She was out.

6
00:02:05,539 --> 00:02:07,473
She landed right there.
She's safe.

7
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,771
Turk: Aw, come on.

8
00:02:11,812 --> 00:02:14,474
Umpire: That's enough.
l don't want to hear another word.

9
00:02:14,514 --> 00:02:16,778
- You're gone!
- Yeah, l'm gone.

10
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:27,317
My grandmother used to take me
to Washington Square Park...

11
00:02:29,162 --> 00:02:31,630
to watch Bobby Fischer
play 10 games at the same time.

12
00:02:31,665 --> 00:02:33,724
Queen me.

13
00:02:33,767 --> 00:02:36,702
He was five-six moves ahead
on each table.

14
00:02:37,704 --> 00:02:40,195
Anyway, he became
the world champ, didn't he?

15
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,265
Then he lost his fucking mind.

16
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:48,241
He became a raving paranoid.

17
00:02:48,281 --> 00:02:50,010
Being attacked
from all directions,

18
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,075
he couldn't see
what was in front of him.

19
00:02:59,192 --> 00:03:01,387
Mate. Mate!

20
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:23,875
( both laugh )

21
00:03:31,758 --> 00:03:34,283
My name is David Fisk,

22
00:03:34,327 --> 00:03:36,488
Detective First Grade.

23
00:03:37,697 --> 00:03:40,564
l've been a cop in the NYPD
for over 30 years.

24
00:03:41,902 --> 00:03:44,234
ln that time...

25
00:03:45,839 --> 00:03:48,307
l've killed 14 people.

26
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:52,201
Man: Run that by me
one more time.

27
00:03:53,213 --> 00:03:55,773
l've killed 14 people.

28
00:03:55,815 --> 00:03:57,476
He's nuts.

29
00:03:59,953 --> 00:04:02,183
Turk's voice: When did
these things start?

30
00:04:06,293 --> 00:04:08,454
How did they start?

31
00:04:13,567 --> 00:04:16,832
Maybe this one started
with a guy named Charles Randall.

32
00:04:22,442 --> 00:04:25,377
Randall was a child killer.

33
00:04:27,147 --> 00:04:29,513
He killed his girlfriend's daughter

34
00:04:29,549 --> 00:04:31,983
about four years ago.

35
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,345
Randall: Fuck you, damn asshole.

36
00:04:36,623 --> 00:04:38,250
Turk's voice: He was tried
for the crime,

37
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,759
but was acquitted
by a jury of his peers.

38
00:04:55,275 --> 00:04:58,403
My partner and l
found this unacceptable.

39
00:05:02,182 --> 00:05:05,151
My partner is a good man.

40
00:05:26,172 --> 00:05:28,766
Are you really
gonna do this thing?

41
00:05:28,808 --> 00:05:30,833
Do what?

42
00:05:30,877 --> 00:05:33,311
You're going to
take down Randall

43
00:05:33,346 --> 00:05:35,507
for a homicide
he didn't commit.

44
00:05:40,387 --> 00:05:42,719
What am l gonna do?

45
00:05:42,756 --> 00:05:44,747
You're my partner.

46
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:47,191
- You're my role model.
- Right.

47
00:05:47,227 --> 00:05:49,218
What am l gonna do
without a role model?

48
00:05:52,632 --> 00:05:55,430
We didn't have
this conversation.

49
00:05:55,468 --> 00:05:57,959
What conversation?

50
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,853
Turk's voice: lt got done.

51
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:26,189
Randall lost his freedom

52
00:06:26,232 --> 00:06:28,200
for the crime he didn't commit.

53
00:06:34,074 --> 00:06:36,133
Turk's voice: l lost my faith.

54
00:06:38,812 --> 00:06:41,337
- l'm gonna go.
- Okay.

55
00:06:51,257 --> 00:06:51,458
You can take this
as a confession if you want.

56
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:54,393
You can take this
as a confession if you want.

57
00:06:54,427 --> 00:06:56,418
Whatever.

58
00:06:56,463 --> 00:06:59,261
A few weeks ago
things heated up.

59
00:06:59,299 --> 00:07:01,062
What do we got on him, Turk?

60
00:07:01,101 --> 00:07:05,504
Marcus Smith, AKA Spider--
big big dope deals,

61
00:07:05,538 --> 00:07:07,972
murders, extortion,
lots of nice things.

62
00:07:08,007 --> 00:07:10,339
He converted
this old abandoned bank

63
00:07:10,376 --> 00:07:12,503
into Club 404 of Harlem.

64
00:07:12,545 --> 00:07:14,172
Maybe when he sees us
he'll confess.

65
00:07:14,214 --> 00:07:16,182
What, you don't believe
in miracles?

66
00:07:16,216 --> 00:07:17,808
When you pick up a check
one day--

67
00:07:17,851 --> 00:07:20,183
one day,
then l'll believe in miracles.

68
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,348
- Let's go. l'm buying.
- Yeah, that's a miracle l want to see.

69
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:26,222
( crowd chattering,
distant music playing )

70
00:07:27,427 --> 00:07:30,021
( hip-hop music playing )
# We fly high, no lie #

71
00:07:30,063 --> 00:07:33,032
# You hear that?
You know this, balling #

72
00:07:33,066 --> 00:07:36,035
# Foreign rides outside #

73
00:07:36,069 --> 00:07:38,128
# lt's like showbiz,
we in the building #

74
00:07:38,171 --> 00:07:40,366
# We stay fly, no lie... #

75
00:07:40,406 --> 00:07:42,169
Turk: This is where he launders
his money.

76
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:46,167
Rooster: Oh, yeah,
cleaning green green green.

77
00:07:46,212 --> 00:07:48,407
Turk: He's all business.

78
00:07:49,816 --> 00:07:51,647
l gotta take a leak.

79
00:08:01,394 --> 00:08:03,555
Oh, l'll just be a sec.

80
00:08:03,596 --> 00:08:05,063
l'm not peeking.

81
00:08:05,098 --> 00:08:07,498
No problem.

82
00:08:12,038 --> 00:08:14,563
- You guys are so lucky.
- Why is that?

83
00:08:14,607 --> 00:08:16,905
No line to the bathroom and...

84
00:08:16,943 --> 00:08:18,808
( sniffs )

85
00:08:18,845 --> 00:08:21,075
you get to pee standing up.

86
00:08:21,114 --> 00:08:22,945
Unzip, psss, zip.

87
00:08:22,982 --> 00:08:25,246
Badda boom badda bing,
you're out of here.

88
00:08:25,285 --> 00:08:29,688
Yeah, the big guy really outdid himself
on this thing.

89
00:08:29,722 --> 00:08:31,087
You want a bump?

90
00:08:31,124 --> 00:08:33,058
Where did you get that from?

91
00:08:33,092 --> 00:08:35,526
Spider. Supremo.

92
00:08:39,732 --> 00:08:42,166
( train whistle blows )

93
00:09:04,724 --> 00:09:06,715
( door closes )

94
00:09:19,672 --> 00:09:21,663
( muffled screams )

95
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:24,199
( crash, thumping )

96
00:09:36,923 --> 00:09:38,948
( sighs )

97
00:09:43,963 --> 00:09:45,954
Not bad.

98
00:09:45,999 --> 00:09:49,264
Turk: Not bad?
What the fuck were you looking for?

99
00:09:49,302 --> 00:09:51,702
Come on, Turk,

100
00:09:51,738 --> 00:09:53,729
you pulled my hair.

101
00:09:53,773 --> 00:09:56,970
Gee, my little sister used to
pull my hair harder than that.

102
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,204
Whatever.

103
00:10:02,382 --> 00:10:04,475
l gotta go.

104
00:10:15,628 --> 00:10:17,926
- Where the fuck are you going?
- l'm tired.

105
00:10:17,964 --> 00:10:20,626
You're tired?
lt's America, you whiny bitch.

106
00:10:20,667 --> 00:10:23,500
Why don't you fucking get in the cab
and do some honest work?

107
00:10:23,536 --> 00:10:26,403
Yeah, she's on her way.
She can't wait to see you.

108
00:10:26,439 --> 00:10:29,704
Rambo the Skateboard Pimp
was my 10th kill.

109
00:10:31,844 --> 00:10:35,541
- ( muffled gunshot )
- Think of me as a street-sweeper.

110
00:10:35,581 --> 00:10:37,674
l cleaned up this worthless
piece of shit

111
00:10:37,717 --> 00:10:40,743
and left an obituary of sorts.
lt rhymes.

112
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:51,995
Rooster, we gotta find out
who did this.

113
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,896
Give him a medal.

114
00:10:53,933 --> 00:10:56,766
Hey, Rambo, you see
who did this?

115
00:10:56,803 --> 00:10:58,771
He ain't talking, eh?

116
00:10:58,805 --> 00:11:01,000
Real name Robert Brady.

117
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,031
Bobby Brady. Damn shame.

118
00:11:03,076 --> 00:11:04,907
What are you thinking?
Marcia? Greg?

119
00:11:04,944 --> 00:11:06,377
( both chuckle )

120
00:11:06,412 --> 00:11:08,403
You guys messing up
my crime scene again?

121
00:11:08,448 --> 00:11:10,575
You don't know
who Bobby Brady is?

122
00:11:10,616 --> 00:11:12,607
Yeah, we met about an hour ago.

123
00:11:12,652 --> 00:11:15,416
- lt looks like close range.
- From the stippling around the wound

124
00:11:15,455 --> 00:11:17,082
l'd say two to three feet away.

125
00:11:17,123 --> 00:11:19,853
We'll be fishing fragments
out of his brains.

126
00:11:19,892 --> 00:11:21,951
- What?
- No, l just got that--

127
00:11:21,995 --> 00:11:24,088
''Marcia? Greg?''
That's a good one, Rooster.

128
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:25,859
Well, that was quick.

129
00:11:25,898 --> 00:11:27,729
Just trying to keep pace with you.

130
00:11:31,904 --> 00:11:35,032
Turk: ''He trades in sin,
distributes flesh.

131
00:11:35,074 --> 00:11:37,440
He picks the fruit
when it is fresh.

132
00:11:37,477 --> 00:11:40,605
Now someone else
must slap his whore.

133
00:11:40,646 --> 00:11:45,379
His heart has stopped.
He breathes no more.''

134
00:11:47,253 --> 00:11:49,278
What do you want to do
about this?

135
00:11:49,322 --> 00:11:52,120
l say let's make the best of it,

136
00:11:52,158 --> 00:11:55,286
canvass the hookers.
Maybe we'll meet one you like.

137
00:11:55,328 --> 00:11:58,957
Please. l got all l can handle
from you-know-who.

138
00:11:58,998 --> 00:12:00,795
No shit?

139
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:03,927
She's got my sperm level so low
l gotta sit down to take a piss.

140
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,631
Oh, thanks for that picture.

141
00:12:05,671 --> 00:12:07,935
- Hey, what can l tell you?
- ( laughs )

142
00:12:07,974 --> 00:12:10,738
( Russian accent )
How can l help you, gentlemen?

143
00:12:10,777 --> 00:12:12,802
We'd like to talk to you
about your boss.

144
00:12:12,845 --> 00:12:15,109
He's upstairs.

145
00:12:15,148 --> 00:12:17,480
No, your other boss.

146
00:12:21,287 --> 00:12:23,278
Rambo.

147
00:12:23,322 --> 00:12:25,256
He is asshole.

148
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:28,454
Why ''he is asshole''?

149
00:12:28,494 --> 00:12:30,894
Follow me, please.

150
00:12:35,668 --> 00:12:37,295
You know anybody
who'd want to kill him?

151
00:12:37,336 --> 00:12:38,997
Me.

152
00:12:39,038 --> 00:12:40,335
Anyone else?

153
00:12:40,373 --> 00:12:42,364
Why? He's dead?

154
00:12:42,408 --> 00:12:44,069
( chuckles )

155
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:46,635
Hey, listen, you want to smarten up
and help us out

156
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:48,374
or am l gonna have to call
somebody at lCE

157
00:12:48,414 --> 00:12:50,177
and have you on the next plane
to kielbasa-land?

158
00:12:50,216 --> 00:12:52,047
Go ahead.

159
00:12:52,085 --> 00:12:53,985
l am American citizen.

160
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,079
Yeah.

161
00:12:56,122 --> 00:12:58,181
Lick my balls anytime.

162
00:12:58,224 --> 00:12:59,816
What?

163
00:12:59,859 --> 00:13:01,850
Call us anytime, you know,

164
00:13:01,894 --> 00:13:04,294
if you hear something, anything.

165
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:09,499
Rooster: l think we're looking
for a guy named Sam the Butcher.

166
00:13:09,535 --> 00:13:12,003
- Who?
- ( laughs )

167
00:13:12,038 --> 00:13:14,302
Nah, he's kidding around.
But seriously, Lieutenant,

168
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,365
how far do you want us to go
with this Rambo murder?

169
00:13:16,409 --> 00:13:18,877
l don't know, l was thinking maybe
you could investigate it a bit more,

170
00:13:18,911 --> 00:13:21,311
figure out who did it,
try to put him in jail.

171
00:13:21,347 --> 00:13:24,214
That is, if it doesn't get in the way
of your shuffleboard lessons.

172
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,774
Yeah, no problem.

173
00:13:25,818 --> 00:13:28,685
We're also working this dealer Spider
who's tied to these two stiffs

174
00:13:28,721 --> 00:13:30,018
we found on Fresh Kills.

175
00:13:33,326 --> 00:13:36,227
lf we can nail him, who knows
how far up the ladder it will lead?

176
00:13:36,262 --> 00:13:37,388
So what about it?

177
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:39,125
l popped this lawyer
with an ounce of blow.

178
00:13:39,165 --> 00:13:41,531
She practically shoved it up my nose.
l got her to flip on him.

179
00:13:41,567 --> 00:13:43,228
Lucky fuck, eh?

180
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:44,896
She scored it from him directly?

181
00:13:44,937 --> 00:13:47,235
- Yeah, she did.
- Good.

182
00:13:47,273 --> 00:13:50,970
Okay, well, get what you can out of her
and kick her loose.

183
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:53,446
l hate trying to prosecute
fucking lawyers.

184
00:13:53,446 --> 00:13:56,279
( trains passing )

185
00:14:02,188 --> 00:14:04,418
- This isn't Spider's club.
- The back way in.

186
00:14:04,457 --> 00:14:08,484
Rooster: Yeah, it's an abandoned
linen factory, Jessica.

187
00:14:08,528 --> 00:14:11,463
l guess l'm not your average--

188
00:14:11,497 --> 00:14:12,987
what do you call it?

189
00:14:13,032 --> 00:14:15,023
- Rat?
- Stoolie?

190
00:14:15,067 --> 00:14:17,058
Thanks.

191
00:14:17,103 --> 00:14:20,800
l mean, l think usually
it's some poor African-American kid

192
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,070
or a junkie or a prostitute.

193
00:14:23,109 --> 00:14:25,669
Well, normally 200-grand-a-year
corporate lawyers

194
00:14:25,711 --> 00:14:28,646
are much smarter than your average
African-American junkie whore--

195
00:14:28,681 --> 00:14:31,309
normally, but sometimes
they only think they are.

196
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:34,217
Man over radio: lt's all set
on this end.

197
00:14:34,253 --> 00:14:35,914
Are you guys sure
it's safe in there?

198
00:14:35,955 --> 00:14:39,015
Man: You tell your girlfriend
to grow a pair and let's go.

199
00:14:39,058 --> 00:14:42,118
What do you say, Counsel?
Are you ready to do this thing?

200
00:14:42,161 --> 00:14:44,823
Yeah, let's get it over with.

201
00:14:44,864 --> 00:14:47,833
Okay, remember what we said?
You go in there,

202
00:14:47,867 --> 00:14:51,268
you wait for him to ask you
for what you need, right?

203
00:14:51,304 --> 00:14:53,932
And then you don't come back here
with less than four ounces.

204
00:14:53,973 --> 00:14:55,440
- Four ounces?
- Yeah.

205
00:14:55,474 --> 00:14:58,136
lsn't that a lot? l, like, buy a couple
of balls at the club, that's it.

206
00:14:58,177 --> 00:15:01,146
You just say you're going skiing and
you need a week's worth of fresh powder.

207
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,512
Yeah, you tell him you're going
on vacation.

208
00:15:06,419 --> 00:15:10,150
l do this thing
and my record's wiped clean?

209
00:15:10,189 --> 00:15:11,486
As a whistle.

210
00:15:11,524 --> 00:15:13,492
No one at my law firm will know
that l got busted, right?

211
00:15:13,526 --> 00:15:15,050
lt never happened.

212
00:15:16,162 --> 00:15:18,460
Look, Counsel, we all know you
better than this.

213
00:15:18,497 --> 00:15:21,091
You just do this, you stop
shoving that shit up your nose,

214
00:15:21,133 --> 00:15:22,896
you go home, you get married,
you have kids,

215
00:15:22,935 --> 00:15:25,597
you never come back here,
and that's that.

216
00:15:27,106 --> 00:15:29,438
Yeah.

217
00:15:29,475 --> 00:15:32,308
Officer: Everybody's in position.

218
00:15:32,345 --> 00:15:34,813
- Turk: Okay, we're going.
- Officer: Yes, sir.

219
00:15:37,116 --> 00:15:39,778
Officer: Let's push the signal
back 50%.

220
00:15:40,786 --> 00:15:42,811
Rooster: Hey, Jessica.

221
00:15:42,855 --> 00:15:44,322
Break a leg.

222
00:15:44,357 --> 00:15:47,019
( radio chatter )

223
00:15:47,059 --> 00:15:49,050
lt's two flights down.

224
00:15:49,095 --> 00:15:51,461
The door's on the left.
Ring the bell.

225
00:15:56,936 --> 00:15:58,460
( rings doorbell )

226
00:15:58,504 --> 00:16:00,972
Hey, Stubby, why don't you
go and escort our company up here?

227
00:16:02,775 --> 00:16:04,800
Go on, fat boy.

228
00:16:08,681 --> 00:16:10,205
Get it on.

229
00:16:17,823 --> 00:16:20,519
- Good afternoon.
- Hey, Spider.

230
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:23,050
- l'll be downstairs.
- All right.

231
00:16:23,095 --> 00:16:25,120
- How are you?
- All right, baby,

232
00:16:25,164 --> 00:16:27,530
just checking out this wizard shit
before l let my kids watch it.

233
00:16:27,566 --> 00:16:30,034
- You seen this?
- No.

234
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:32,537
The guy is a stone dealer.
l let my little ones watch this--

235
00:16:32,571 --> 00:16:34,835
they'll all turn out junkies.
You know what l'm saying?

236
00:16:34,874 --> 00:16:36,364
He's got a point.

237
00:16:36,409 --> 00:16:38,604
- You remember Underdog?
- What about him?

238
00:16:38,644 --> 00:16:41,579
That fucking dog spawned
a generation of junkies.

239
00:16:41,614 --> 00:16:45,448
So you converted the bank
into a club and a recording studio?

240
00:16:45,484 --> 00:16:48,044
- Yeah. You like it?
- Yeah.

241
00:16:48,087 --> 00:16:49,987
What are you talking about?

242
00:16:50,022 --> 00:16:51,751
What did Underdog do
all the time?

243
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:53,486
He was always shining shoes

244
00:16:53,526 --> 00:16:55,687
and whenever Sweet Polly Purebred
would call out to him,

245
00:16:55,728 --> 00:16:57,696
his dog ears would pick it up
and he'd rescue her.

246
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:00,198
Yeah, but what did he do
when he needed his super strength?

247
00:17:00,232 --> 00:17:02,393
He'd go to his ring, remember?

248
00:17:02,435 --> 00:17:04,300
Pull out a pill, pop it.

249
00:17:04,337 --> 00:17:07,829
Holy shit, you're right.
He was a little fucking speed freak.

250
00:17:07,873 --> 00:17:09,204
Spider: So what's the business?

251
00:17:09,241 --> 00:17:12,074
How about a QP?
You're good for a QP.

252
00:17:12,111 --> 00:17:13,772
The fuck you want with QP?

253
00:17:13,813 --> 00:17:16,441
l'm going skiing with friends,

254
00:17:16,482 --> 00:17:19,042
a lot of friends.

255
00:17:19,085 --> 00:17:21,519
- Where?
- Aspen, Colorado.

256
00:17:21,554 --> 00:17:24,284
Shit. l'm sure you can
score one in Aspen.

257
00:17:24,323 --> 00:17:26,314
Not your primo brand.

258
00:17:27,326 --> 00:17:28,759
You ski?

259
00:17:28,794 --> 00:17:30,284
Sure. My whole life.

260
00:17:30,329 --> 00:17:33,457
Come on, l don't have all day.

261
00:17:33,499 --> 00:17:35,831
Why don't you put down your jacket,
stay a little while?

262
00:17:35,868 --> 00:17:37,062
What do you think?

263
00:17:37,103 --> 00:17:38,661
Jessica: Actually,
l've got to run.

264
00:17:38,704 --> 00:17:42,606
l have a major lPO
closing in an hour, so...

265
00:17:42,641 --> 00:17:45,371
You know, stress will kill you.
You gotta chill out.

266
00:17:46,746 --> 00:17:48,680
l'm as chill as l get.

267
00:17:48,714 --> 00:17:50,705
What do you want to do?

268
00:17:54,053 --> 00:17:56,453
You know, every once in a while...

269
00:17:58,624 --> 00:18:00,683
one of you Upper East Side bitches
gets popped,

270
00:18:00,726 --> 00:18:02,717
tries to to roll over
on a nigga like me.

271
00:18:02,762 --> 00:18:04,855
You're scared now.

272
00:18:04,897 --> 00:18:08,060
( doorbell ringing )

273
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:12,127
Looks like the cavalry
come to rescue you.

274
00:18:12,171 --> 00:18:13,661
Can l help you, gentlemen?

275
00:18:13,706 --> 00:18:15,139
Yeah, let us in, Spider.

276
00:18:15,174 --> 00:18:17,369
l'm sorry, there's no one here
by that name.

277
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:20,311
- Let us in.
- We only want to talk to you.

278
00:18:20,346 --> 00:18:22,974
( door buzzes )

279
00:18:23,015 --> 00:18:25,916
See, l know how to look
and l know where to look.

280
00:18:31,857 --> 00:18:33,825
Come to papa.

281
00:18:35,528 --> 00:18:37,189
lt always hurts the first time.

282
00:18:38,531 --> 00:18:39,828
Turk: You all right?

283
00:18:39,865 --> 00:18:41,662
Why wouldn't she be all right?
We're watching TV.

284
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,361
How the fuck is she gonna get hurt
watching TV?

285
00:18:43,402 --> 00:18:45,996
She could have seen or heard
something that scared her.

286
00:18:46,038 --> 00:18:47,938
- Like what?
- Like some big fucking mutt

287
00:18:47,973 --> 00:18:49,497
shooting his bug fat
fucking mouth off.

288
00:18:49,542 --> 00:18:52,409
Wasn't nobody here fitting that description
till a minute ago.

289
00:18:52,445 --> 00:18:54,345
l'm gonna show you ugly,
you fucking mother--

290
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,848
- We've said enough.
- Oh, you finna bring your wife up in here?

291
00:18:56,882 --> 00:18:59,942
That's it. That's it.
Let's go. lt's okay.

292
00:18:59,985 --> 00:19:02,715
- You okay?
- Yeah, l'm okay. l'm okay.

293
00:19:02,755 --> 00:19:04,723
You want your wire back?

294
00:19:06,325 --> 00:19:08,190
Firearm!

295
00:19:08,227 --> 00:19:09,319
No, Stubby, no!

296
00:19:18,103 --> 00:19:19,934
Get down.
Get the fuck down!

297
00:19:29,715 --> 00:19:31,182
Turk: Come on.

298
00:19:31,217 --> 00:19:34,015
The fat one's dead.

299
00:19:35,421 --> 00:19:38,219
( Jessica moaning )

300
00:19:43,128 --> 00:19:44,527
Well, that went well.

301
00:19:46,398 --> 00:19:48,298
Oh, shit, you're bleeding.

302
00:19:49,301 --> 00:19:52,395
3-4 squad, Central.
11-41, request ambulance.

303
00:19:52,438 --> 00:19:55,236
l need EMS. Subject shot,
184th and St. Nicholas.

304
00:19:55,274 --> 00:19:57,469
Really, l tried my best.

305
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:00,809
You're doing just fine, Counsel.
You're doing just fine. Just relax.

306
00:20:00,846 --> 00:20:03,940
Hey, guys, if you ever
need a lawyer...

307
00:20:03,983 --> 00:20:06,713
Yeah, okay.

308
00:20:06,752 --> 00:20:09,220
You bet.

309
00:20:11,957 --> 00:20:14,187
ln good old days
we used to

310
00:20:14,226 --> 00:20:16,956
let the perp bleed out
and call off the ambulance.

311
00:20:16,996 --> 00:20:18,930
- Calm calm calm.
- Fucking lowlife.

312
00:20:18,964 --> 00:20:20,761
You made your point.
You made your point.

313
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,097
Tough little bitch, ain't you,
kicking a man while he's handcuffed?

314
00:20:23,135 --> 00:20:25,626
Shut the fuck up,
you piece of shit.

315
00:20:25,671 --> 00:20:27,298
You think l won't blow
your fucking head off?

316
00:20:27,339 --> 00:20:29,102
l wouldn't think twice
about it.

317
00:20:29,141 --> 00:20:31,405
l'd go in there,
get the fat boy's gun,

318
00:20:31,443 --> 00:20:35,106
come back here
and put two between your eyes.

319
00:20:35,147 --> 00:20:37,081
( rapid footsteps )

320
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,910
Where's EMS?

321
00:20:41,954 --> 00:20:45,151
Woman: This thing was a clusterfuck
to end all clusterfucks.

322
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:46,748
You got nothing.

323
00:20:46,792 --> 00:20:48,760
How about felony murder?

324
00:20:48,794 --> 00:20:51,285
No drugs, right?
So no predicate felony,

325
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:53,230
no conspiracy,
no nothing.

326
00:20:53,265 --> 00:20:55,290
No felony. No felony.
l can't believe this.

327
00:20:55,334 --> 00:20:57,063
No felony.
How do you spell felony?

328
00:20:57,102 --> 00:21:00,435
Homicide, racketeering, drugs--
l mean, what are we talking about?

329
00:21:00,472 --> 00:21:03,100
Hey, you're lucky
that white girl didn't die.

330
00:21:03,142 --> 00:21:05,042
lAB is gonna interview
both of you

331
00:21:05,077 --> 00:21:07,545
and do a preliminary report
over the next couple of weeks.

332
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:11,072
Now off the record
you actually didn't violate procedure

333
00:21:11,116 --> 00:21:13,550
because the victim had a firearm
aimed at you,

334
00:21:13,586 --> 00:21:15,816
so if you stick together
you should make it through this.

335
00:21:15,854 --> 00:21:17,845
Lieutenant: You'd better get
your story straight too,

336
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:20,723
'cause l'm not going back to Far Rockaway
because you two fucked up.

337
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:23,353
And you're gonna spend some couch time
with the rubber-gun squad.

338
00:21:23,395 --> 00:21:27,195
And you'd better take this shrink seriously
or you'll be off active duty.

339
00:21:27,232 --> 00:21:28,995
That fucking piece of shit
just walks.

340
00:21:29,034 --> 00:21:30,831
Knock it off, Turk.

341
00:21:33,339 --> 00:21:35,967
Relax, partner.
He's gonna get his.

342
00:21:36,008 --> 00:21:38,533
Man: Gentlemen, your questions.

343
00:21:38,577 --> 00:21:40,977
- Who made the decision to enter?
- l did.

344
00:21:41,013 --> 00:21:43,004
- Whose decision was it to enter?
- Mine.

345
00:21:43,048 --> 00:21:45,346
Did you immediately identify yourselves
as police officers?

346
00:21:45,384 --> 00:21:47,682
- Yes, we did.
- Did you immediately identify yourselves?

347
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,211
The informant's position
was becoming untenable.

348
00:21:50,255 --> 00:21:52,519
- We were afraid she was in danger.
- Turns out you were right.

349
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:55,049
- No fucking kidding, nine-to-fiver.
- Excuse me, Detective?

350
00:21:55,094 --> 00:21:57,494
Are you finished
with my client?

351
00:21:59,465 --> 00:22:03,424
- They're like Lennon and McCartney.
- Not an inch of daylight between them.

352
00:22:03,469 --> 00:22:04,697
What do you think?

353
00:22:04,737 --> 00:22:06,034
Nothing there.

354
00:22:06,071 --> 00:22:08,938
They endangered the informant.
We can't make them wrong on that.

355
00:22:08,974 --> 00:22:10,601
They saw a gun, they reacted.

356
00:22:10,643 --> 00:22:12,406
They beat the fuck
out of the suspect,

357
00:22:12,444 --> 00:22:14,537
but he's not filing charges.

358
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,639
Let's see what the shrink says.

359
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:20,050
So what are we gonna
do now, Doc?

360
00:22:20,085 --> 00:22:22,280
Are we gonna find out
if l'm sane enough

361
00:22:22,321 --> 00:22:25,051
to carry a gun,
chase bad guys?

362
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:27,684
Okay, why did you become a cop?

363
00:22:27,726 --> 00:22:30,456
Well, it was New Year's Eve.
lt seemed like a good idea at the time.

364
00:22:30,496 --> 00:22:34,398
l didn't have the same opportunities
you had, Dr. Prosky.

365
00:22:34,433 --> 00:22:37,129
Where l come from
it was either a gun and a badge

366
00:22:37,169 --> 00:22:39,034
or a hard hat and a hammer.

367
00:22:39,071 --> 00:22:41,539
How do you feel
when you fire your weapon?

368
00:22:41,573 --> 00:22:44,303
lt's like Dirty Harry said--
''There's nothing wrong

369
00:22:44,343 --> 00:22:46,971
with a little shooting as long as
the right people get shot.''

370
00:22:47,012 --> 00:22:48,946
Prosky: And when the wrong people
get shot?

371
00:22:48,981 --> 00:22:51,950
Turk: lt sucks, but l'd rather be in it
that out of it.

372
00:22:51,984 --> 00:22:54,077
There's nothing worse
than being stuck on a bench.

373
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:56,349
How do you feel when you see
innocent people get killed?

374
00:22:56,388 --> 00:22:58,618
You know...

375
00:23:00,392 --> 00:23:03,589
l sort of get numb to it.

376
00:23:03,629 --> 00:23:06,291
Here.

377
00:23:06,331 --> 00:23:07,821
l want you to take this.

378
00:23:07,866 --> 00:23:11,233
Use it to jot down your thoughts,
your questions,

379
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:13,761
anything you may have noticed
about yourself,

380
00:23:13,806 --> 00:23:15,273
whatever.

381
00:23:15,307 --> 00:23:17,138
l won't ask for it.

382
00:23:17,176 --> 00:23:19,940
Just for you.

383
00:23:19,978 --> 00:23:21,468
l want you to try it.

384
00:23:21,513 --> 00:23:23,538
Sounds like fun.

385
00:23:25,417 --> 00:23:28,978
( Karen panting )
Harder.

386
00:23:35,828 --> 00:23:38,126
( crowd cheering )

387
00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:45,000
Go, Turk, go!

388
00:23:46,371 --> 00:23:49,431
You got third.
Go go!

389
00:23:49,475 --> 00:23:52,171
Yeah!
Look at that.

390
00:23:52,211 --> 00:23:54,577
You own it. You own it.

391
00:23:54,613 --> 00:23:56,478
No matter what they say
about you,

392
00:23:56,515 --> 00:23:58,608
you're tremendous!

393
00:24:00,686 --> 00:24:03,018
Go go, Turk, go!

394
00:24:04,857 --> 00:24:06,950
Safe.
You dropped the ball.

395
00:24:06,992 --> 00:24:09,324
- A fucking cheap shot, man.
- Get away from the bag.

396
00:24:09,361 --> 00:24:12,296
- Or what? Or what? Or what?
- Watch the bag.

397
00:24:12,331 --> 00:24:15,994
( all yelling )

398
00:24:23,942 --> 00:24:26,376
Turk's voice: The NYPD is bubbling
with frustration,

399
00:24:26,411 --> 00:24:28,003
hostility and testosterone,

400
00:24:28,046 --> 00:24:30,037
ready to erupt
at any moment.

401
00:24:30,082 --> 00:24:32,107
Think of me
as the release valve.

402
00:24:32,151 --> 00:24:34,984
One flick of the trigger
and the pressure goes down.

403
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:37,113
You know why
you join the force?

404
00:24:37,156 --> 00:24:39,249
To get respect.

405
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:41,020
Most people respect the badge.

406
00:24:41,059 --> 00:24:43,391
Everybody respects the gun.

407
00:24:48,834 --> 00:24:50,825
Hey, Riley, l was talking to JD--

408
00:24:50,869 --> 00:24:53,929
you guys caught a stiff named
Phillip Trager, a gun-runner?

409
00:24:53,972 --> 00:24:56,202
Oh, yeah, a real piece of shit.

410
00:24:56,241 --> 00:24:58,175
- How did that go down?
- l don't know.

411
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:00,474
Somebody gave him a taste
of his own medicine, l guess,

412
00:25:00,512 --> 00:25:02,912
walked right into his apartment,
killed him with one of his own guns.

413
00:25:02,948 --> 00:25:05,212
Did the shooter leave a note
or anything?

414
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:08,219
Yeah, actually,
the shooter left a poem.

415
00:25:11,323 --> 00:25:13,848
He did?
No shit.

416
00:25:13,892 --> 00:25:15,883
Yeah. Hey, Simon,

417
00:25:15,928 --> 00:25:19,364
you remember that poem
from the Trager case?

418
00:25:21,366 --> 00:25:23,425
What are you doing, man?

419
00:25:23,468 --> 00:25:25,459
Turk's asking about it.

420
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:27,972
What the hell are you doing?

421
00:25:28,006 --> 00:25:30,440
Que mierda 'tas haciendo ahi, papa?

422
00:25:30,475 --> 00:25:32,409
No le digas mierda a eso loco.

423
00:25:32,444 --> 00:25:36,073
Riley: Calmate. He wants to hear
about the poem.

424
00:25:36,114 --> 00:25:38,344
''Merchant of thieving class,

425
00:25:38,383 --> 00:25:41,511
l slit his throat
and capped his ass.

426
00:25:41,553 --> 00:25:43,020
l took his gun, l took his--

427
00:25:43,055 --> 00:25:46,047
l took his life, l took his gun,
But too bad he's not the only one.''

428
00:25:46,091 --> 00:25:48,150
That's how it goes,
something like that.

429
00:25:48,193 --> 00:25:50,491
lt's not iambic pentameter,
but it rhymes.

430
00:25:50,529 --> 00:25:52,520
- Rooster.
- Yo.

431
00:25:53,532 --> 00:25:55,432
We're looking for the same guy.

432
00:25:55,467 --> 00:25:58,630
He knocked off a pimp named Rambo
a few weeks ago. When was yours?

433
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:01,195
Last week. We're running ours with the ATF
because of the guns.

434
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,300
We're back in business on the Rambo case.
Looks like the same guy knocked off

435
00:26:04,343 --> 00:26:06,777
- a gun dealer on the three-three last week.
- No shit.

436
00:26:06,812 --> 00:26:09,781
- What do you mean? That's our case.
- That's our case. You're taking our case.

437
00:26:09,815 --> 00:26:12,283
Seniority, guys.
Tag along, you'll learn something.

438
00:26:12,317 --> 00:26:14,478
Oh, tell me the guy's name
is Greg Brady.

439
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:16,487
Please. lt is, isn't it?

440
00:26:16,521 --> 00:26:19,081
Oh, somebody's knocking off
the Brady Bunch.

441
00:26:19,124 --> 00:26:22,992
Gotta be the Partridge Family.
( laughs )

442
00:26:23,028 --> 00:26:26,088
Turk's voice: Trager,
a gun-runner bites the dust--

443
00:26:26,131 --> 00:26:28,190
number 11.

444
00:26:36,575 --> 00:26:40,375
Karen: The bullet matched the .45
in Trager's apartment.

445
00:26:40,412 --> 00:26:42,880
That was no surprise.
So l ran it through ATF.

446
00:26:42,915 --> 00:26:45,941
lt's one of a batch of six
that was stolen from a gun shop

447
00:26:45,984 --> 00:26:48,282
- in Virginia last month.
- Yeah, probably by Trager.

448
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,016
That's what they think.
He matches the description they have.

449
00:26:51,056 --> 00:26:53,752
lt still doesn't help us find the guy.
lt just helps us tie him to the victims,

450
00:26:53,792 --> 00:26:56,283
which he's already doing
with his little fucking poems.

451
00:26:56,328 --> 00:26:59,388
- ( phone ringing )
- Excuse me. Hello.

452
00:26:59,431 --> 00:27:02,662
Hey, Turk, don't forget
we got a court date later.

453
00:27:02,701 --> 00:27:05,864
So...

454
00:27:05,904 --> 00:27:09,533
l heard he kicked the shit
out of that dealer you guys took down.

455
00:27:09,574 --> 00:27:11,405
Spider.

456
00:27:11,443 --> 00:27:12,603
So?

457
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:16,770
Did he?

458
00:27:19,618 --> 00:27:22,246
Yeah, he got him
down on the ground.

459
00:27:22,287 --> 00:27:24,687
The guy was handcuffed.

460
00:27:25,691 --> 00:27:28,785
And he just started
kicking him in the gut.

461
00:27:28,827 --> 00:27:31,227
And then

462
00:27:31,263 --> 00:27:33,595
he gets down on the guy's chest

463
00:27:33,632 --> 00:27:36,965
and he really starts smacking him

464
00:27:37,002 --> 00:27:39,937
hard in the face over and over

465
00:27:39,972 --> 00:27:41,963
and screaming at the top
of his lungs,

466
00:27:42,007 --> 00:27:44,271
''l'm gonna break
your fucking face,

467
00:27:44,309 --> 00:27:46,709
you little bitch!''

468
00:27:46,745 --> 00:27:49,077
Then his eyes really started
to fill up.

469
00:27:49,114 --> 00:27:51,105
l mean, they get dark--

470
00:27:51,149 --> 00:27:53,310
you know how he gets
the sort of rage in him.

471
00:27:54,453 --> 00:27:57,115
l thought he was gonna
kill this guy.

472
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:00,958
Really?

473
00:28:03,662 --> 00:28:06,062
You're a bad little girl.

474
00:28:06,098 --> 00:28:07,963
Hmm?

475
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,060
- l got work to do.
- You bet.

476
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:16,439
Woman: Counselor,
my hands are tied here.

477
00:28:16,475 --> 00:28:18,466
Without a secure
chain of custody,

478
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:21,240
any evidence obtained
after the initial search

479
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,747
- must be excluded.
- You gotta be fucking kidding me.

480
00:28:23,782 --> 00:28:26,148
Therefore l am forced
to grant defense

481
00:28:26,184 --> 00:28:28,482
motion to dismiss
all charges

482
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,715
of rape and assault
against Mr. Van Luytens.

483
00:28:30,756 --> 00:28:32,747
- Your Honor.
- Judge: You think l want this guy

484
00:28:32,791 --> 00:28:34,952
going anywhere
near my daughter,

485
00:28:34,993 --> 00:28:37,154
or anyone's daughter
for that matter?

486
00:28:37,195 --> 00:28:39,663
You messed up.
l am unleashing your client

487
00:28:39,698 --> 00:28:41,962
unto the world.
l'm sure we'll all be

488
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,433
back here again very soon.

489
00:28:43,468 --> 00:28:46,460
Look at him.
Look at this motherfucker.

490
00:28:46,505 --> 00:28:50,100
Hey, it's gonna come back to you, mutt.
You're gonna get it.

491
00:28:50,142 --> 00:28:52,576
- When you walk outside watch your back.
- Easy, Turk.

492
00:28:52,611 --> 00:28:53,771
Order in my court.

493
00:28:53,812 --> 00:28:57,077
- Okay, mutt? You fucking mutt.
- Not here, not now.

494
00:28:57,115 --> 00:28:59,549
Not here, not now.
Will you get him out of here

495
00:28:59,584 --> 00:29:02,144
before somebody passes a sentence
on him you can't appeal?

496
00:29:02,187 --> 00:29:03,415
Order!

497
00:29:03,455 --> 00:29:06,583
- You know what l mean? Go go.
- Order, Detective.

498
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:10,584
Turk's voice: Dr. Prosky suggested
that l free-associate.

499
00:29:10,629 --> 00:29:13,029
So here l go.

500
00:29:13,065 --> 00:29:15,693
You know what l think about
when l pull a trigger?

501
00:29:15,734 --> 00:29:18,669
- l think about the lnfield Fly Rule.
- ( doorbell buzzes )

502
00:29:18,703 --> 00:29:21,729
l love that fucking rule.
lt assumes the worst in everybody.

503
00:29:21,773 --> 00:29:25,470
lt says, ''Sorry, batter, you're a schmuck
for popping up with runners on.

504
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:27,910
And you, stupid-ass infielder,
you don't get to cheat

505
00:29:27,946 --> 00:29:30,380
and drop the ball just because
you caught a break.''

506
00:29:30,415 --> 00:29:32,076
My favorite part--
the batter's out

507
00:29:32,117 --> 00:29:34,278
but the runners advance
at their own risk.

508
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:36,583
Well, isn't this
a pleasant surprise?

509
00:29:36,621 --> 00:29:38,714
Turk's voice: That's the way
life should be.

510
00:29:38,757 --> 00:29:40,748
You can be a motherfucker
at your own risk.

511
00:29:40,792 --> 00:29:44,023
( muffled gunshots )

512
00:29:44,062 --> 00:29:47,896
Or not.
Van Luytens-- one less rapist.

513
00:29:47,933 --> 00:29:50,163
Who's gonna miss him?
Nobody.

514
00:29:50,202 --> 00:29:52,363
Number 1 2 and counting.

515
00:30:06,618 --> 00:30:08,518
Whoa whoa, hot coffee.

516
00:30:08,553 --> 00:30:10,248
- Good morning, Detective Riley.
- Hey, good morning.

517
00:30:10,288 --> 00:30:12,256
- Door on your left.
- Any signs of forced entry?

518
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:13,985
Doesn't look like it.
Detective Perez is in there.

519
00:30:14,025 --> 00:30:15,424
He's in there already?
All right.

520
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:17,587
- Hey, how about those Mets last night?
- Yeah, how about 'em?

521
00:30:17,629 --> 00:30:19,688
Hey, Teddy, Teddy, come here,
check this out.

522
00:30:21,099 --> 00:30:23,465
Wow.

523
00:30:23,502 --> 00:30:24,730
Fuck.

524
00:30:24,769 --> 00:30:27,567
- Oh my God.
- That's big.

525
00:30:27,606 --> 00:30:29,597
And powerful.

526
00:30:29,641 --> 00:30:32,508
- What, a plasma screen?
- LCD.

527
00:30:32,544 --> 00:30:34,603
- That's plasma.
- No, it's got to be LCD.

528
00:30:34,646 --> 00:30:36,944
- Perez: lt wouldn't be that big.
- Hey, guys, guys.

529
00:30:36,982 --> 00:30:40,418
He was shot at close range,
dropped right here.

530
00:30:40,452 --> 00:30:43,216
The pussy doesn't look like he put up
much of a fight, does he, Karen?

531
00:30:43,255 --> 00:30:45,314
Nothing to indicate that

532
00:30:45,357 --> 00:30:48,884
in terms of struggle.
No forced entry, cuts, bruises.

533
00:30:48,927 --> 00:30:52,158
Hey, nobody wants to hear
about your private life, Officer Corelli.

534
00:30:52,197 --> 00:30:55,428
That's detective to you,
Officer Needledick.

535
00:30:55,467 --> 00:30:57,401
- Ooh.
- Perez: Ouch.

536
00:30:57,435 --> 00:30:59,767
- Looks like it's our guy again.
- Who did you get this time?

537
00:30:59,804 --> 00:31:01,465
This is Jonathan Van Luytens.

538
00:31:01,506 --> 00:31:03,440
He owns a couple
of car dealerships.

539
00:31:03,475 --> 00:31:05,807
- Oh, shit.
- He was up on rape charges,

540
00:31:05,844 --> 00:31:08,039
but they got tossed out
last week.

541
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:10,070
Look at this.

542
00:31:10,115 --> 00:31:14,211
''A man devoid of all respect,
Of beauty, charm or intellect,

543
00:31:14,252 --> 00:31:16,686
He took what women
would not give.

544
00:31:16,721 --> 00:31:18,655
He didn't have
the right to live.''

545
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:21,056
That's our boy all right.

546
00:31:21,092 --> 00:31:24,255
Looks like he had a beef
with our old pal Jonny.

547
00:31:24,296 --> 00:31:25,388
You know him?

548
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:27,295
Both: Yeah.

549
00:31:27,332 --> 00:31:29,630
He's one slippery
son of a bitch, let me tell you.

550
00:31:29,668 --> 00:31:32,370
Turk: Yeah.

551
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:35,498
Lieutenant: You guys know how much
fun it is to not catch a serial killer?

552
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:37,269
You got a point here, Lieutenant?

553
00:31:37,309 --> 00:31:39,072
The point is

554
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:41,237
you'd better both
think seriously

555
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,372
about whether or not
you want the lead on this case.

556
00:31:43,415 --> 00:31:45,076
You don't think
we're up to this?

557
00:31:46,084 --> 00:31:49,281
Come on, you got what,

558
00:31:49,321 --> 00:31:52,017
about 110 years on the job
between the two of you?

559
00:31:52,057 --> 00:31:55,117
- 1 20.
- ( laughs )

560
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,424
l'm telling you, you screw it up
badly enough,

561
00:31:57,462 --> 00:31:59,657
they may try to fuck you
out of your pension.

562
00:31:59,698 --> 00:32:00,926
You want to risk that?

563
00:32:00,966 --> 00:32:02,797
- Yeah.
- Fuck, yeah.

564
00:32:02,834 --> 00:32:07,794
406, Lieutenant. 406.

565
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:10,433
Okay, 406--
what does that mean?

566
00:32:10,475 --> 00:32:11,999
Ted Williams.

567
00:32:12,043 --> 00:32:15,103
Ted Williams, the last day of the season,
is batting 400.

568
00:32:15,146 --> 00:32:18,240
Sox manager wants to bench him,
protect his average, right?

569
00:32:18,283 --> 00:32:20,080
Williams plays
both games anyway,

570
00:32:20,118 --> 00:32:22,086
goes six for eight,
ends up at 406--

571
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,815
the last guy that ever hit
over 400.

572
00:32:23,855 --> 00:32:26,346
Okay, fine. lt's all yours.

573
00:32:26,391 --> 00:32:29,417
Just don't go moaning to me
when some traffic cop

574
00:32:29,461 --> 00:32:31,759
pulls your serial killer over
for speeding

575
00:32:31,796 --> 00:32:34,424
and he grabs your
15 minutes of fame and you realize

576
00:32:34,466 --> 00:32:37,629
the asshole could have been
standing right there in front of you

577
00:32:37,669 --> 00:32:40,729
and it would have taken you
1000 light years to nail him.

578
00:32:40,772 --> 00:32:42,501
Not for nothing, Lieutenant,

579
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:45,600
light years measures distance,
not time.

580
00:32:48,013 --> 00:32:50,481
Well, thank you, Detective.
l'll make a note of that.

581
00:32:50,515 --> 00:32:53,348
Ellis Lynde, 2003.

582
00:32:53,385 --> 00:32:56,149
This guy had a history
of cruising gay bars,

583
00:32:56,187 --> 00:32:58,985
picking up twinkies,
beating the shit out of them.

584
00:32:59,024 --> 00:33:01,925
Lynde was found shot dead
in his apartment.

585
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,861
Whoever's doing this
gets up real close to the guys,

586
00:33:04,896 --> 00:33:07,558
blows their brains out
without any trouble,

587
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:09,089
leaves no fingerprints

588
00:33:09,134 --> 00:33:10,931
and obviously
takes pride in his work.

589
00:33:10,969 --> 00:33:15,269
Okay, what could be
murder number two back from '04,

590
00:33:15,307 --> 00:33:16,740
one Matthew Mitrella.

591
00:33:16,775 --> 00:33:18,709
( trails off )

592
00:33:21,713 --> 00:33:23,840
Turk's voice: l was shaking
the first couple of times

593
00:33:23,882 --> 00:33:26,715
l killed in cold blood.

594
00:33:26,751 --> 00:33:30,084
l kept thinking if l got caught
they'd kick me off the force.

595
00:33:30,121 --> 00:33:32,749
l wasn't worried about prison,
but losing the gun and the shield--

596
00:33:32,791 --> 00:33:34,019
that scared me.

597
00:33:34,059 --> 00:33:36,550
l went into work the next day
expecting to feel different.

598
00:33:36,594 --> 00:33:39,688
l thought everybody would look at me
the way cops look at civilians

599
00:33:39,731 --> 00:33:41,961
and know which ones are dirty.

600
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,272
But they didn't.
That's when l knew

601
00:33:51,309 --> 00:33:53,903
l could keep on
doing this forever.

602
00:33:57,048 --> 00:34:00,984
Turk's voice: So next stop-- Spider.

603
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:03,010
lf we shut down his business,

604
00:34:03,054 --> 00:34:05,045
maybe he'd be a rat.

605
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:07,081
We got a lawyer.

606
00:34:07,125 --> 00:34:10,891
We needed her to testify
that she bought coke from him.

607
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:13,489
She was a good lawyer.

608
00:34:13,531 --> 00:34:17,991
Me and my partner paid a visit
to Club 404 of Harlem.

609
00:34:18,036 --> 00:34:19,162
A word about him--

610
00:34:19,204 --> 00:34:22,298
Tom Cowen's been my partner
for almost 30 years.

611
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:24,274
He's the best cop
l've ever seen.

612
00:34:26,177 --> 00:34:29,704
l'm always the one
following him through the door.

613
00:34:29,748 --> 00:34:31,909
There's a bullet
that was meant for me

614
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:35,511
that's lodged in his torso.

615
00:34:35,553 --> 00:34:37,612
He was my role model.

616
00:34:37,655 --> 00:34:40,021
The day l stopped
trying to be Tom Cowen

617
00:34:40,058 --> 00:34:42,526
was the greatest day
of my life.

618
00:34:56,374 --> 00:34:59,366
Hey, Rooster,

619
00:34:59,411 --> 00:35:02,437
l was going through the files
on poetry boy.

620
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,710
That's an interesting way
to pass your time.

621
00:35:04,749 --> 00:35:07,183
Okay, there was a gun

622
00:35:07,218 --> 00:35:09,379
found on Charles Randall
when he was arrested.

623
00:35:09,421 --> 00:35:10,649
Yeah.

624
00:35:10,688 --> 00:35:13,851
Now in all the other shootings
the gun was left at the scene,

625
00:35:13,892 --> 00:35:17,055
but there are a lot of similarities.
So l mentioned it to Perez and Riley.

626
00:35:17,095 --> 00:35:19,154
l think somebody should go
interview him in prison.

627
00:35:19,197 --> 00:35:21,825
l think there may be a connection.

628
00:35:21,866 --> 00:35:25,324
That's a good idea,
but not Perez and Riley.

629
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:27,804
l mean, not those guys.
They'll screw it up.

630
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:29,966
This is too important.

631
00:35:30,008 --> 00:35:32,476
Turk and l will handle Randall, okay?

632
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:34,068
Good work.

633
00:35:57,535 --> 00:35:59,560
( door buzzes )

634
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:07,876
Detectives, Charles Randall.

635
00:36:09,714 --> 00:36:12,842
What the fuck
do you two scumbags want?

636
00:36:12,884 --> 00:36:15,580
What a greeting.

637
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:18,680
You like poetry, Chuck?

638
00:36:18,723 --> 00:36:19,781
What?

639
00:36:19,824 --> 00:36:23,021
Do you like poetry?

640
00:36:24,062 --> 00:36:27,759
Yeah.
Roses are red, violets are blue,

641
00:36:27,799 --> 00:36:30,734
l want to poke out your fucking eyes
with my dick, you fuck.

642
00:36:30,768 --> 00:36:32,759
How's that?

643
00:36:32,804 --> 00:36:35,432
l thought you'd rhyme.
You didn't.

644
00:36:35,473 --> 00:36:37,634
Fuck you.
Fuck both of you.

645
00:36:37,675 --> 00:36:39,302
Get me out of here.

646
00:36:39,344 --> 00:36:42,245
( door buzzes )

647
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,772
( siren wailing )

648
00:36:45,817 --> 00:36:49,253
( blues playing )

649
00:36:49,287 --> 00:36:51,585
Why the fuck did we even bother
going out there?

650
00:36:51,623 --> 00:36:53,716
What would it look like
if we didn't go?

651
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,655
Are you gonna relax?

652
00:36:57,695 --> 00:36:59,686
Relax.

653
00:36:59,731 --> 00:37:01,631
Yeah, l'll just take it out
on Karen later.

654
00:37:01,666 --> 00:37:03,964
The more l'm with her,
the more abuse she wants.

655
00:37:04,002 --> 00:37:05,264
Sounds like fun.

656
00:37:05,303 --> 00:37:06,895
Hey, you want to take her
off my hands?

657
00:37:06,938 --> 00:37:11,398
Be careful, partner, because l have
a very special effect on women.

658
00:37:11,442 --> 00:37:12,636
Go wild.

659
00:37:12,677 --> 00:37:14,076
Whatever.

660
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:17,104
l can't believe l had to face
that piece of shit and look like an idiot.

661
00:37:17,148 --> 00:37:20,447
Eh, fuck him.
He's where he belongs.

662
00:37:20,485 --> 00:37:22,112
l'm sorry, partner,
l'm really sorry.

663
00:37:22,153 --> 00:37:25,088
Stop worrying about it.

664
00:37:26,925 --> 00:37:30,622
Whatever happens,
l'm not taking you down with me.

665
00:37:30,662 --> 00:37:33,631
Don't worry about me.
l'm all right, believe me.

666
00:37:33,665 --> 00:37:36,930
l don't know what l was thinking.
l just don't know what l was thinking.

667
00:37:36,968 --> 00:37:39,300
You know what you was thinking?
You were thinking

668
00:37:39,337 --> 00:37:41,999
about a 10-year-old girl
who had her skull crushed.

669
00:37:43,007 --> 00:37:45,475
Yeah, l tried to stop you,
but you know what?

670
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:49,776
l admired you that day,
what you did.

671
00:37:49,814 --> 00:37:52,783
That was righteous.

672
00:37:52,817 --> 00:37:56,651
And you don't second-guess yourself
on something like that.

673
00:38:03,661 --> 00:38:05,652
Okay, l'm the killer.

674
00:38:05,697 --> 00:38:08,222
l'm the killer.
l show up at your door

675
00:38:08,266 --> 00:38:10,257
or your car window,

676
00:38:10,301 --> 00:38:12,599
and for some reason
you open your door,

677
00:38:12,637 --> 00:38:15,572
you roll down
your car window for me.

678
00:38:15,607 --> 00:38:17,802
So who am l?

679
00:38:17,842 --> 00:38:20,208
Someone l know.

680
00:38:20,244 --> 00:38:21,734
Maybe a nice set of tits.

681
00:38:21,779 --> 00:38:23,872
And the poems?
What about the poems?

682
00:38:23,915 --> 00:38:26,281
You have to compose the poem
before you got there, right?

683
00:38:26,317 --> 00:38:28,308
Otherwise what, you're gonna
blow out the guy's brains,

684
00:38:28,353 --> 00:38:30,218
sit down and write a little sonnet
for yourself?

685
00:38:30,254 --> 00:38:31,653
No prints on the poems,

686
00:38:31,689 --> 00:38:34,681
so probably
l wore gloves when l wrote it.

687
00:38:34,726 --> 00:38:37,786
You obviously know your victims.
Between that and the easy access,

688
00:38:37,829 --> 00:38:40,161
l guess that they know you too.
They must.

689
00:38:40,198 --> 00:38:42,632
These guys are all scumbags.
They're not gonna trust anyone,

690
00:38:42,667 --> 00:38:45,227
open the door for anyone,
especially if they don't know them.

691
00:38:45,269 --> 00:38:47,601
Yeah, but l more than know them.

692
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:49,971
l know everything about them.
l know their moves,

693
00:38:50,008 --> 00:38:51,873
their patterns,
l know their schedules.

694
00:38:51,909 --> 00:38:54,707
Okay, so you're following them.
You're staking them out.

695
00:39:07,959 --> 00:39:10,553
Anyone gonna say it?

696
00:39:10,595 --> 00:39:12,529
What?

697
00:39:15,033 --> 00:39:17,695
Fuck me.

698
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:21,235
- He's right, it's a cop.
- No.

699
00:39:21,272 --> 00:39:23,570
Let's slow down, fellows.
We're getting way ahead of ourselves.

700
00:39:23,608 --> 00:39:27,203
- Come on, it's a cop, you know it.
- l don't know shit. Neither do you.

701
00:39:27,245 --> 00:39:30,112
l'm telling your right now,
it's a cop, it's a cop, it's a cop.

702
00:39:30,148 --> 00:39:31,843
What do you mean,
''lt's a cop, it's a cop, it's a cop''?

703
00:39:31,883 --> 00:39:35,148
- Where do you come off saying it's a cop?
- Easy, partner, he's just saying it.

704
00:39:35,186 --> 00:39:37,814
- What are you talking about?
- He's just saying--

705
00:39:37,855 --> 00:39:41,154
l know, l know, l know
what he's saying.

706
00:39:42,827 --> 00:39:44,590
And l'm saying it's bullshit.

707
00:39:45,596 --> 00:39:48,565
Shoot me. What the fuck?
But don't say it's a cop.

708
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:55,901
# You cast a spell on me #

709
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:58,500
# l was blind and now l see #

710
00:39:58,543 --> 00:40:01,535
# You work your magic,
that's the key #

711
00:40:01,579 --> 00:40:04,139
# You wave your wand #

712
00:40:04,182 --> 00:40:07,743
# And cast a spell on me... #

713
00:40:07,785 --> 00:40:09,776
Turk: So what about dinner?

714
00:40:09,821 --> 00:40:11,413
You feel like going out?

715
00:40:11,456 --> 00:40:13,253
Where?

716
00:40:13,291 --> 00:40:15,156
l don't care.
You're the one going.

717
00:40:15,193 --> 00:40:17,024
What is your problem?

718
00:40:17,061 --> 00:40:19,052
No problem.

719
00:40:19,097 --> 00:40:21,224
lf you feel like hanging around,
be my guest.

720
00:40:21,265 --> 00:40:22,596
l don't feel like going out.

721
00:40:22,633 --> 00:40:25,796
Fine, just don't bug me.

722
00:40:25,837 --> 00:40:29,967
This is the best part of my day
and l don't need you fucking it up.

723
00:40:31,776 --> 00:40:34,768
So you only fuck cops?

724
00:40:34,812 --> 00:40:37,679
Once in a while
l do a fireman or an ex-con.

725
00:40:39,617 --> 00:40:41,278
You lump us in together?

726
00:40:41,319 --> 00:40:43,446
Well, l have some respect
for firemen.

727
00:40:43,488 --> 00:40:45,285
Fuck you.

728
00:40:45,323 --> 00:40:47,257
You know why they take away
your nightstick

729
00:40:47,291 --> 00:40:49,521
- when you hang up your uniform?
- No.

730
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,755
They don't trust you with it.

731
00:40:51,796 --> 00:40:53,957
Right now l wouldn't trust
myself with it either.

732
00:40:53,998 --> 00:40:56,023
Shit, you'd probably love that.

733
00:40:56,067 --> 00:40:57,728
Too bad you never met
Van Luytens.

734
00:40:57,769 --> 00:40:59,464
You two really would have
hit it off great.

735
00:40:59,504 --> 00:41:01,665
At least somebody finally
brought some justice down

736
00:41:01,706 --> 00:41:03,537
on that dickless little fuck.

737
00:41:03,574 --> 00:41:05,872
Now that is who l'd like to meet.

738
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:07,810
Well, maybe you'll get
your wish one day.

739
00:41:07,845 --> 00:41:09,676
They think it's a cop.

740
00:41:09,714 --> 00:41:11,341
- Makes sense.
- Bullshit.

741
00:41:11,382 --> 00:41:13,373
lt's just some fucking psychopath.

742
00:41:13,417 --> 00:41:15,749
Well, there's plenty of those
on the job.

743
00:41:24,195 --> 00:41:25,753
- Are you sleeping well?
- Not really.

744
00:41:25,797 --> 00:41:27,321
- Yep.
- Eating well?

745
00:41:27,365 --> 00:41:28,832
- No.
- Yeah.

746
00:41:28,866 --> 00:41:30,060
Any recurring nightmares?

747
00:41:30,101 --> 00:41:32,592
Yeah, that l'm stuck
in a room with you forever.

748
00:41:33,805 --> 00:41:35,170
Nope.

749
00:41:35,206 --> 00:41:37,003
Do you think you're fit
to return to duty?

750
00:41:37,041 --> 00:41:39,032
- Abso-fucking-lutely.
- Yeah.

751
00:41:39,076 --> 00:41:42,204
- You ever think about retiring?
- You mean, death with benefits?

752
00:41:42,246 --> 00:41:44,043
What's not to like?

753
00:41:44,081 --> 00:41:46,049
- You ever think about retiring?
- Not really.

754
00:41:46,083 --> 00:41:48,074
What have l got to look forward to?

755
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:50,314
Sailing my 26-footer
around Sheepshead Bay,

756
00:41:50,354 --> 00:41:51,787
umpiring cops' softball?

757
00:41:51,823 --> 00:41:53,916
- How about corporate security work?
- lt's too dangerous.

758
00:41:53,958 --> 00:41:57,223
- So what are you gonna do?
- Maybe l'll buy a boat.

759
00:41:57,261 --> 00:41:58,296
Turk: All right, look,
l don't know if l believe this,

760
00:41:58,296 --> 00:41:59,354
Turk: All right, look,
l don't know if l believe this,

761
00:41:59,397 --> 00:42:01,160
but l'm just gonna
throw it out there.

762
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:03,531
You guys say we're looking
for one of our own,

763
00:42:03,568 --> 00:42:07,527
but what if it was an ex-cop,
somebody with an axe to grind?

764
00:42:07,572 --> 00:42:09,233
You got one in mind?

765
00:42:09,273 --> 00:42:12,401
He's thinking about Martin Baum

766
00:42:12,443 --> 00:42:15,207
our old lieutenant.

767
00:42:15,246 --> 00:42:17,612
So what's the story with him?

768
00:42:17,648 --> 00:42:19,639
He got fired a few years ago.

769
00:42:19,684 --> 00:42:22,881
l'm not saying there's any motive,
but he knew all the victims.

770
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:26,481
Yeah, but Turk,
l knew most of those guys.

771
00:42:26,524 --> 00:42:29,687
So did you, Riley, Perez.
Even Karen knew 'em.

772
00:42:29,727 --> 00:42:31,786
- l'm just throwing it out there.
- Well, maybe you killed 'em.

773
00:42:31,829 --> 00:42:35,128
Yeah, maybe l did.

774
00:42:35,166 --> 00:42:37,327
The poems and the placement
of the weapons

775
00:42:37,368 --> 00:42:39,165
are all we've got
linking the kills,

776
00:42:39,203 --> 00:42:41,899
which means what we gotta do now
is get humping on the forensics.

777
00:42:41,939 --> 00:42:44,305
That shouldn't be
too much of a problem.

778
00:42:44,342 --> 00:42:46,333
We already got the girl
working on that.

779
00:42:46,377 --> 00:42:50,143
That's right, Karen's been
humping on it all week, as we speak.

780
00:42:50,181 --> 00:42:52,649
What did you say?

781
00:42:52,683 --> 00:42:53,945
Here we go again.

782
00:42:53,985 --> 00:42:55,748
- You should watch your mouth.
- Oh, yeah?

783
00:42:55,786 --> 00:42:58,254
He didn't mean anything by it.
Karen and him are ancient history.

784
00:42:58,289 --> 00:43:00,450
- College boy can't speak for himself?
- Yeah, l can speak for myself.

785
00:43:00,491 --> 00:43:02,288
Let me speak for myself--
fuck you, Turk.

786
00:43:02,326 --> 00:43:04,294
Mutt, l'm gonna hit you
on the head with this barbell.

787
00:43:04,328 --> 00:43:06,421
l'm not better than you.
You're not better than me, man.

788
00:43:06,464 --> 00:43:08,159
You put your balls
in your pocket.

789
00:43:08,199 --> 00:43:09,860
And you, fellow officers,

790
00:43:09,901 --> 00:43:14,099
a little courtesy
for a fellow professional, you know?

791
00:43:14,138 --> 00:43:17,164
Please. Are we gonna move on
here now?

792
00:43:17,208 --> 00:43:19,199
What are we doing?
Where were we?

793
00:43:19,243 --> 00:43:22,804
Talking about Martin Baum.
What's his story?

794
00:43:22,847 --> 00:43:25,338
Some guys under him
got caught taking money.

795
00:43:25,383 --> 00:43:27,647
Baum stood up for them,
tried to cover it up.

796
00:43:27,685 --> 00:43:30,085
He do time?

797
00:43:30,121 --> 00:43:32,954
Well, they pressed charges,
but he plead out and resigned.

798
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:34,981
So what's his beef with you?

799
00:43:35,026 --> 00:43:36,857
l could have lied to protect him,
but l didn't.

800
00:43:36,894 --> 00:43:39,886
Okay, but if he's got a beef with you,
why not go after you?

801
00:43:39,931 --> 00:43:42,422
Why not kill you? Why go around
acting like a serial killer,

802
00:43:42,466 --> 00:43:44,331
killing all these degenerates?
lt doesn't make any sense.

803
00:43:44,368 --> 00:43:46,802
- l'm just telling you.
- l'm telling you it doesn't make sense.

804
00:43:46,837 --> 00:43:48,896
l'm throwing it out there.
l'm saying this is what it is.

805
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:51,033
You want to check him out or not?
l don't give a shit.

806
00:43:51,075 --> 00:43:53,600
- lt doesn't make any sense.
- You're the ones that think it's a cop.

807
00:43:53,644 --> 00:43:55,578
l'm just saying here's a cop
with a chip on his shoulder.

808
00:43:55,613 --> 00:43:57,604
Check him out if you want.
l don't give a shit.

809
00:43:57,648 --> 00:44:00,981
Calm down and give a better reason
why Baum could be a suspect, okay?

810
00:44:01,018 --> 00:44:02,781
( door slams )

811
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:05,254
PMS, gotta be.

812
00:44:12,029 --> 00:44:14,930
- Hey, guys.
- What's going on?

813
00:44:14,966 --> 00:44:17,366
l came over to bring you
the FBl report

814
00:44:17,401 --> 00:44:19,369
on the paper
and handwriting.

815
00:44:19,403 --> 00:44:21,530
You don't have a problem
with me looking over the evidence

816
00:44:21,572 --> 00:44:24,006
that l collected and processed
for you, do you?

817
00:44:24,041 --> 00:44:25,941
- No problem.
- Put it back, Karen.

818
00:44:25,977 --> 00:44:27,968
- This is fascinating.
- Let's go, come on.

819
00:44:28,012 --> 00:44:29,980
Come on, let's go, let's go.

820
00:44:30,014 --> 00:44:31,811
- What?
- Come on, let's go.

821
00:44:31,849 --> 00:44:33,874
Get your hands off me.

822
00:44:33,918 --> 00:44:36,148
l'll give you a little privacy.
l don't want to interrupt anything here.

823
00:44:36,187 --> 00:44:37,984
Are you afraid of me
looking at your old case files?

824
00:44:38,022 --> 00:44:40,490
- ls that it?
- Okay, l'm gone. Enjoy.

825
00:44:40,524 --> 00:44:42,515
- What?
- What is it with you?

826
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,585
- What is it with you?
- ( door slams )

827
00:44:47,932 --> 00:44:51,390
l'm sorry about last night, okay?

828
00:44:51,435 --> 00:44:54,097
l really am. lt's a habit.

829
00:44:54,138 --> 00:44:57,039
Habits can be broken, right?

830
00:44:57,074 --> 00:44:58,473
That's bullshit.

831
00:44:58,509 --> 00:44:59,771
No.

832
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:02,278
l'm totally serious, all right?

833
00:45:03,748 --> 00:45:06,046
lt's not bullshit,

834
00:45:06,083 --> 00:45:08,074
really.

835
00:45:14,759 --> 00:45:17,227
Perez: Why do you think
Turk was so quick to take the lead

836
00:45:17,261 --> 00:45:20,162
on the poetry case, huh?
To keep us from finding the killer, man.

837
00:45:20,197 --> 00:45:22,563
That's what l would do
if l was covering my tracks.

838
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:25,535
He sticks us on this Baum stakeout
'cause it's more misdirection.

839
00:45:25,569 --> 00:45:26,729
Makes sense.

840
00:45:26,771 --> 00:45:28,966
l hate that Turk, man.

841
00:45:35,646 --> 00:45:37,637
( buzzing )

842
00:45:57,635 --> 00:45:59,626
Hey, he's coming out.
He's coming out.

843
00:46:01,872 --> 00:46:04,204
Oh, at 2:45 in the morning.

844
00:46:07,478 --> 00:46:10,936
ls it killing time
or is he just killing time?

845
00:46:30,568 --> 00:46:33,059
Come on, Baum,
go kill someone already.

846
00:46:33,104 --> 00:46:35,629
Perez: Yeah, kill Turk, man.
He's the one setting you up.

847
00:46:35,673 --> 00:46:37,140
Do us all a favor.

848
00:46:42,279 --> 00:46:44,770
Hey, did you see Turk's
marksmanship scores?

849
00:46:44,815 --> 00:46:46,373
Did you see this?
lt's ridiculous.

850
00:46:46,417 --> 00:46:48,317
Service-- 99,
70 out of 100.

851
00:46:48,352 --> 00:46:51,788
Combat Association awards,
department commendations.

852
00:46:51,822 --> 00:46:54,222
This guy could take out your left nut
at 50 yards.

853
00:46:57,495 --> 00:46:59,520
Perez: Did you see the computer
trajectories, man?

854
00:46:59,563 --> 00:47:00,996
Not one stray slug.

855
00:47:01,031 --> 00:47:03,363
Even Berkowitz put a couple
in the Corinthian leather.

856
00:47:08,506 --> 00:47:10,974
Riley: What about Karen?
She come up with anything new?

857
00:47:11,008 --> 00:47:12,873
Perez: No, not yet.

858
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:14,878
lf Baum kills somebody
l don't want us to be in the car

859
00:47:14,912 --> 00:47:17,278
waiting when it happens, okay?

860
00:47:19,116 --> 00:47:20,777
l'll go.

861
00:47:20,818 --> 00:47:22,809
Attaboy, Teddy, attaboy.

862
00:47:22,853 --> 00:47:24,218
l'm proud of you, son.

863
00:47:27,391 --> 00:47:29,382
( lighter clicks )

864
00:47:35,432 --> 00:47:37,593
( cocks gun )
You're Perez, right?

865
00:47:37,635 --> 00:47:38,966
Yeah.

866
00:47:39,003 --> 00:47:40,698
l'm Martin Baum.

867
00:47:44,308 --> 00:47:46,435
l got a permit for this.

868
00:47:46,477 --> 00:47:49,207
l work security
in the diamond district.

869
00:47:49,246 --> 00:47:52,044
So you figure it's a cop
doing the poetry killings?

870
00:47:52,082 --> 00:47:54,949
Someone says, ''Check out Baum.
He thinks he got a raw deal.''

871
00:47:54,985 --> 00:47:57,419
That's what passes
for police work these days?

872
00:47:57,454 --> 00:47:58,944
Do you think
you got a raw deal?

873
00:47:58,989 --> 00:48:00,854
Damn straight.

874
00:48:00,891 --> 00:48:03,223
- Life sucks.
- Yeah.

875
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:05,820
- Everything okay, Simon?
- Teddy, where the fuck were you, man?

876
00:48:05,863 --> 00:48:08,161
Anything else you want to tell us,
Lieutenant Baum?

877
00:48:08,199 --> 00:48:12,101
- l got something for you in my pocket.
- Huh-uh!

878
00:48:13,637 --> 00:48:18,370
A passport, credit card receipts,
boarding passes.

879
00:48:18,409 --> 00:48:20,400
The day Brady was killed

880
00:48:20,444 --> 00:48:22,613
l was escorting a client
to Brazil.

881
00:48:26,951 --> 00:48:30,045
Man: Judgment is
the dominion of the Lord.

882
00:48:30,087 --> 00:48:32,988
And if this person,
this worthless rapist

883
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:35,548
or murderer,
as you describe him,

884
00:48:35,593 --> 00:48:38,994
if he is truly repentant
and seeks absolution,

885
00:48:39,029 --> 00:48:41,395
it must be granted to him.

886
00:48:41,432 --> 00:48:43,866
Your name doesn't ring a bell,

887
00:48:43,901 --> 00:48:48,167
but l've had so many
altar boys over the years.

888
00:48:48,205 --> 00:48:50,901
( muffled gunshot )

889
00:48:52,276 --> 00:48:54,267
Turk's voice: So many altar boys

890
00:48:54,311 --> 00:48:57,007
that it's hard to remember
their names.

891
00:48:57,047 --> 00:49:00,107
My name is David Fisk,
Detective First Grade.

892
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:02,414
You may not
remember me now,

893
00:49:02,453 --> 00:49:05,616
but l guarantee you'll remember my name
for the rest of your life.

894
00:49:05,656 --> 00:49:09,524
Father Connell,
may he rot in hell.

895
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:12,028
1 3 down, one to go.

896
00:49:12,062 --> 00:49:14,724
( bells tolling )

897
00:49:14,765 --> 00:49:17,131
( police radio chatter )

898
00:49:20,471 --> 00:49:24,066
Karen: White underwear
below the knee.

899
00:49:24,108 --> 00:49:26,576
- ( camera shutter clicking )
- Briefs-style.

900
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:29,044
Large tweezers.

901
00:49:29,079 --> 00:49:32,537
l am removing a card that has been
inserted in the rectum of the deceased

902
00:49:32,583 --> 00:49:36,610
and placing it
in a plastic evidence bag.

903
00:49:39,323 --> 00:49:43,054
- l'll be right back.
- All right.

904
00:49:44,728 --> 00:49:47,356
Hey. lt's another one,

905
00:49:47,398 --> 00:49:49,593
handwritten.

906
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:55,634
''The old man
who the children trust,

907
00:49:55,673 --> 00:49:59,302
Unable to control his lust,

908
00:49:59,343 --> 00:50:02,244
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

909
00:50:02,279 --> 00:50:06,340
The church can't stop him.
Someone must.''

910
00:50:07,718 --> 00:50:09,709
l'll see what else l can find.

911
00:50:15,292 --> 00:50:17,556
What's the matter with you?

912
00:50:17,594 --> 00:50:19,892
Father Connell gave me
my first communion

913
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:22,694
back in Bensonhurst.

914
00:50:25,069 --> 00:50:27,560
Hey, guys.
Sorry we didn't get a chance to call.

915
00:50:27,604 --> 00:50:30,664
- Yeah, l bet you are.
- Go over there, take a look around.

916
00:50:30,708 --> 00:50:32,835
We'll compare notes later, okay?

917
00:50:32,876 --> 00:50:36,004
Looks like our friend just settled
an old score with the priest,

918
00:50:36,046 --> 00:50:38,037
left him with his pants down.

919
00:50:38,082 --> 00:50:39,709
- Come on.
- No, look.

920
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:41,217
Come on, don't talk like that.

921
00:50:41,251 --> 00:50:43,219
- Hey, look for yourself.
- Have a little respect.

922
00:50:44,755 --> 00:50:47,952
Next thing they're gonna tell us
Lieutenant Baum was an altar boy here.

923
00:50:47,991 --> 00:50:51,427
Tell me about it.
These two guys fucking stink.

924
00:50:51,462 --> 00:50:53,794
Look, Doctor,
you read the poems.

925
00:50:53,831 --> 00:50:56,061
lt is possible, right,
that this guy is a cop?

926
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:58,466
l've never seen it.

927
00:50:58,502 --> 00:51:01,300
l've never even heard
about a cop serial killer.

928
00:51:01,338 --> 00:51:03,499
Come on, girls,
let's go, let's go.

929
00:51:04,508 --> 00:51:08,467
Yeah. Go go go go go
go go go go!

930
00:51:08,512 --> 00:51:09,536
Safe.

931
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:12,048
Doc, give us a tip.
How are we gonna catch this guy?

932
00:51:12,082 --> 00:51:14,073
You don't have to worry
about that.

933
00:51:14,118 --> 00:51:15,779
He wants to get caught.

934
00:51:18,088 --> 00:51:20,750
You don't have any better place
to have lunch?

935
00:51:20,791 --> 00:51:22,588
l wanted to thank you.

936
00:51:22,626 --> 00:51:24,355
What, about Spider?

937
00:51:24,395 --> 00:51:26,056
Yeah.

938
00:51:26,096 --> 00:51:28,690
And for looking in on me
at the hospital

939
00:51:28,732 --> 00:51:30,256
and the encouragement.

940
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:31,597
Why would he want that?

941
00:51:31,635 --> 00:51:34,195
After a while
getting away with it isn't enough.

942
00:51:34,238 --> 00:51:36,229
Jessica: So is your daughter
on the team?

943
00:51:36,273 --> 00:51:39,106
No, she used to play,
but now she's 25, living in California,

944
00:51:39,143 --> 00:51:41,839
five years sober
and working as a nurse.

945
00:51:41,879 --> 00:51:44,040
And her mother?

946
00:51:44,081 --> 00:51:46,106
Her mother died
when she was very young.

947
00:51:47,117 --> 00:51:50,052
Doctor: He wants everybody to know
that he got away with it,

948
00:51:50,087 --> 00:51:54,114
to show everybody
just how brilliant he is.

949
00:51:54,158 --> 00:51:57,321
Most of these killings were criminals
in Rooster's and his beat, right?

950
00:51:57,361 --> 00:51:59,226
And then he all but threatens
to kill Van Luytens

951
00:51:59,263 --> 00:52:01,231
in front of hundreds of witnesses.
And then he sends us

952
00:52:01,265 --> 00:52:04,325
on this crazy wild goose chase
after Lieutenant Baum, didn't he?

953
00:52:04,368 --> 00:52:06,359
- Yes, he did.
- Why would he do that? Why?

954
00:52:06,403 --> 00:52:08,928
You gotta show me more than that.
So far you got shit.

955
00:52:08,972 --> 00:52:10,564
- Give him more, man.
- You want more?

956
00:52:10,607 --> 00:52:13,235
- How about the church records?
- The very ones that Turk was

957
00:52:13,277 --> 00:52:15,211
so diligently pursuing.
How about that?

958
00:52:15,245 --> 00:52:18,146
lt turns out our most recent victim,
the late Father Connell,

959
00:52:18,182 --> 00:52:20,912
was moved all over the place--
eight parishes in 20 years.

960
00:52:20,951 --> 00:52:23,442
Why would they do that
with a Catholic priest? lt's obvious.

961
00:52:23,487 --> 00:52:25,978
He's giving the children
more than communion behind the altar.

962
00:52:26,023 --> 00:52:28,457
Now Turk already admits
to knowing this guy as a child.

963
00:52:28,492 --> 00:52:29,823
lt's very plausible.

964
00:52:31,261 --> 00:52:34,424
Lieutenant: This priest,
this Father Connell,

965
00:52:34,465 --> 00:52:36,160
he gave you your first
holy communion, eh?

966
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:37,326
He did.

967
00:52:37,367 --> 00:52:40,598
Did he every try to do
anything inappropriate? l mean...

968
00:52:40,637 --> 00:52:42,628
l know what you mean.
No, never.

969
00:52:44,341 --> 00:52:46,332
Okay, fine.
ls there any reason

970
00:52:46,376 --> 00:52:48,606
why somebody out there
might think that he did?

971
00:52:48,645 --> 00:52:50,203
No.

972
00:52:50,247 --> 00:52:52,579
Am l a suspect here, Lieutenant?

973
00:52:53,617 --> 00:52:55,642
No,

974
00:52:55,686 --> 00:52:59,520
but these bodies
are starting to smell.

975
00:52:59,556 --> 00:53:02,150
A lot of it is drifting
in your direction.

976
00:53:02,192 --> 00:53:04,183
Drifting or being pushed?

977
00:53:04,228 --> 00:53:06,321
What can l say?

978
00:53:06,363 --> 00:53:08,797
You got connections
to most of these victims.

979
00:53:08,832 --> 00:53:11,767
You're not exactly
Mother Teresa.

980
00:53:13,070 --> 00:53:15,971
l never had any problem
with that priest.

981
00:53:16,006 --> 00:53:18,941
Okay. Okay, fine.

982
00:53:18,976 --> 00:53:21,706
That settles it.

983
00:53:27,851 --> 00:53:29,944
l had a talk with Riley and Perez.

984
00:53:29,987 --> 00:53:31,511
Good cops.

985
00:53:31,555 --> 00:53:34,023
Don't fuck around, okay?
Just listen.

986
00:53:34,057 --> 00:53:35,319
l'm listening.

987
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:37,759
They think
Turk might be our guy.

988
00:53:41,665 --> 00:53:43,895
Oh, man. l gotta tell you,

989
00:53:43,934 --> 00:53:46,630
from where l'm sitting
that is so fucking funny.

990
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:48,729
You can't take that seriously.

991
00:53:48,772 --> 00:53:51,741
Everybody has pretty much
accepted the fact

992
00:53:51,775 --> 00:53:54,335
- that we're chasing one of our own.
- But it ain't Turk.

993
00:53:54,378 --> 00:53:56,141
Sure as l'm sitting here
he ain't the guy.

994
00:53:56,179 --> 00:53:57,806
- You know that?
- Yes, l do.

995
00:53:57,848 --> 00:54:00,316
- How do you know that?
- Because l know it.

996
00:54:00,350 --> 00:54:02,910
l know it to a moral certainty.

997
00:54:02,953 --> 00:54:04,420
Okay?

998
00:54:05,622 --> 00:54:07,613
This priest,

999
00:54:07,658 --> 00:54:10,252
this Father Connell--

1000
00:54:10,294 --> 00:54:12,592
he was Turk's priest
when he was a kid.

1001
00:54:12,629 --> 00:54:13,653
He told you that.

1002
00:54:13,697 --> 00:54:15,995
He didn't tell me this priest
was a child molester.

1003
00:54:16,033 --> 00:54:18,968
- l can't believe this bullshit.
- Believe it, all right?

1004
00:54:19,002 --> 00:54:21,562
- Turk's a good guy.
- You understand?

1005
00:54:21,605 --> 00:54:23,869
- He's the best cop you got.
- Don't you tell me what l gotta do.

1006
00:54:23,907 --> 00:54:25,966
Don't you say a goddamn word
to him about this either,

1007
00:54:26,009 --> 00:54:27,943
or you're finished.

1008
00:54:31,281 --> 00:54:34,773
( humming a tune )

1009
00:54:37,888 --> 00:54:39,879
Can l speak now?

1010
00:54:39,923 --> 00:54:41,720
Feel free.

1011
00:54:42,726 --> 00:54:46,560
He cares.
You know what l'm saying?

1012
00:54:46,597 --> 00:54:49,498
Turk cares about people.

1013
00:54:50,834 --> 00:54:53,826
l know he runs around
like a pit bull on crack sometimes.

1014
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:56,464
lt doesn't matter.

1015
00:54:56,506 --> 00:54:58,770
He cares about protecting people.

1016
00:54:58,809 --> 00:55:00,868
And if you don't back him,

1017
00:55:00,911 --> 00:55:04,781
you will regret it.

1018
00:55:24,301 --> 00:55:25,962
( bangs )

1019
00:55:26,003 --> 00:55:27,493
Jesus.

1020
00:55:27,537 --> 00:55:29,266
Sorry.

1021
00:55:29,306 --> 00:55:32,002
l just never rattled
anyone's cage before.

1022
00:55:32,042 --> 00:55:35,102
- Got a minute?
- Yeah, what's up?

1023
00:55:35,145 --> 00:55:38,546
You know me and Turk
are buddies, right?

1024
00:55:38,582 --> 00:55:40,072
Of course.

1025
00:55:40,117 --> 00:55:41,607
l'd do anything for him.

1026
00:55:41,652 --> 00:55:44,052
He would do anything for you.

1027
00:55:44,087 --> 00:55:45,315
Would you?

1028
00:55:45,355 --> 00:55:46,879
Would l what?

1029
00:55:46,923 --> 00:55:48,948
Would you do anything for him?

1030
00:55:52,496 --> 00:55:54,293
l don't know--
where is this going?

1031
00:55:54,331 --> 00:55:56,356
He wants you
to have sex with me.

1032
00:55:58,502 --> 00:56:00,402
Really?

1033
00:56:02,305 --> 00:56:04,136
He wouldn't mind.

1034
00:56:04,174 --> 00:56:06,870
But that's not why l'm here.

1035
00:56:06,910 --> 00:56:09,572
Okay, why are you here?

1036
00:56:09,613 --> 00:56:12,844
Where were you
the night Rambo was killed

1037
00:56:12,883 --> 00:56:15,852
and Trager?
Got an alibi for those nights?

1038
00:56:17,354 --> 00:56:20,585
l mean, did you know either one
those guys before they were murdered?

1039
00:56:20,624 --> 00:56:23,593
Makes you uncomfortable
when l talk like that.

1040
00:56:23,627 --> 00:56:26,425
You look like you're guilty.
You're not guilty.

1041
00:56:26,463 --> 00:56:28,556
l know that.
You didn't kill those guys, did you?

1042
00:56:32,235 --> 00:56:35,261
Now you know what Turk feels.

1043
00:56:39,309 --> 00:56:43,040
l need you to get me
some information

1044
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:45,105
discreetly.

1045
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:48,183
Can you do that for me?

1046
00:56:48,218 --> 00:56:50,482
You got it.

1047
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,181
Absolutely.

1048
00:56:52,222 --> 00:56:54,213
Let's solve these fucking murders.

1049
00:56:56,393 --> 00:56:58,554
( phone rings )

1050
00:56:58,595 --> 00:56:59,960
Oh.

1051
00:56:59,996 --> 00:57:02,089
- Rooster: Hey, boy genius.
- Perfect timing, buddy.

1052
00:57:02,132 --> 00:57:04,157
Listen, you really worked
on Hingis, didn't you?

1053
00:57:04,201 --> 00:57:05,896
He was all worked up
about my partner.

1054
00:57:05,936 --> 00:57:07,836
Good. He should be.

1055
00:57:07,871 --> 00:57:10,431
l think we should sit down,
see if we can square things, okay?

1056
00:57:10,474 --> 00:57:13,671
All right. Want to meet at Montrose
at 8:00 PM?

1057
00:57:13,710 --> 00:57:17,009
Could you make that 9:00?
l gotta meet an old friend.

1058
00:57:17,047 --> 00:57:18,674
Yeah, sure, whatever you want.

1059
00:57:21,218 --> 00:57:24,517
( blues playing )
# Baby's got issues #

1060
00:57:24,554 --> 00:57:28,012
# Baby's got pains... #

1061
00:57:28,058 --> 00:57:30,049
- Hey, fellows.
- Hey.

1062
00:57:30,093 --> 00:57:33,256
Thanks for coming.

1063
00:57:33,296 --> 00:57:35,924
- This here is Cheryl Brooks.
- Hello, Cheryl Brooks.

1064
00:57:35,966 --> 00:57:37,957
Cheryl's got something to tell you.

1065
00:57:39,136 --> 00:57:42,765
My daughter Lynn

1066
00:57:42,806 --> 00:57:45,331
died four years ago.

1067
00:57:45,375 --> 00:57:48,310
She was 10 years old.
She was raped and she was murdered.

1068
00:57:50,413 --> 00:57:54,543
The guy l was living with,
Charles--

1069
00:57:54,584 --> 00:57:55,744
Charles Randall.

1070
00:57:55,786 --> 00:57:58,880
Yeah, Charles Randall-- he did it.

1071
00:57:58,922 --> 00:58:01,720
Why are you telling us this?

1072
00:58:01,758 --> 00:58:04,886
Because he got off for that.
He was acquitted at trial.

1073
00:58:04,928 --> 00:58:07,158
- Because?
- Because?

1074
00:58:08,932 --> 00:58:11,230
l testified for him.

1075
00:58:11,268 --> 00:58:14,101
- You did what?
- l said he was with me.

1076
00:58:15,672 --> 00:58:19,369
You see, Cheryl here is
a very forgiving person,

1077
00:58:19,409 --> 00:58:21,707
unlike us hard-asses.

1078
00:58:21,745 --> 00:58:24,009
- He threatened to kill me.
- Okay, Cheryl.

1079
00:58:24,047 --> 00:58:27,505
Now you say goodbye
to the nice officers

1080
00:58:27,551 --> 00:58:31,385
and you go on back home.

1081
00:58:31,421 --> 00:58:34,219
Don't drink yourself to death.

1082
00:58:36,326 --> 00:58:38,851
Okay, so...

1083
00:58:38,895 --> 00:58:41,261
eh?

1084
00:58:44,167 --> 00:58:46,897
l want to hear you say it.

1085
00:58:46,937 --> 00:58:49,531
Come on, say it.

1086
00:58:53,977 --> 00:58:57,970
We planted the gun
in Randall's apartment, okay?

1087
00:58:58,014 --> 00:59:00,346
l said it. Happy?

1088
00:59:00,383 --> 00:59:01,975
- Thank you.
- Yes, l am.

1089
00:59:02,018 --> 00:59:04,782
l'd do it again if l had to
'cause that fucking maggot

1090
00:59:04,821 --> 00:59:08,621
could rot away for all eternity.
l'd sleep just fine.

1091
00:59:08,658 --> 00:59:10,057
So what do you want from us?

1092
00:59:10,093 --> 00:59:12,584
You guys think
my partner's a serial killer.

1093
00:59:12,629 --> 00:59:14,426
You're way off.

1094
00:59:14,464 --> 00:59:17,524
You like Turk for this thing?
Go have your fun.

1095
00:59:17,567 --> 00:59:19,967
l'll go along with you.

1096
00:59:20,003 --> 00:59:22,563
l'll even help you.

1097
00:59:22,606 --> 00:59:26,269
But do not drag up Chuck Randall
and that fucking gun,

1098
00:59:26,309 --> 00:59:29,745
because if he walks out of jail
he's gonna end up dead.

1099
00:59:29,779 --> 00:59:31,838
Excuse me?

1100
00:59:33,416 --> 00:59:36,852
l'll put two
through his fucking head

1101
00:59:36,887 --> 00:59:39,447
myself.

1102
00:59:39,489 --> 00:59:41,753
Done deal.

1103
00:59:41,791 --> 00:59:44,919
( soprano singing )

1104
00:59:54,804 --> 00:59:57,739
My grandmother loved opera.

1105
00:59:57,774 --> 00:59:59,799
She supported us by sewing.

1106
00:59:59,843 --> 01:00:02,937
l used to thread needles
for my grandmother.

1107
01:00:02,979 --> 01:00:05,277
- Gave all her money to church.
- You admired her?

1108
01:00:05,315 --> 01:00:07,442
l worshipped her.

1109
01:00:07,484 --> 01:00:10,282
Rooster? Yeah, he's religious,
goes to church.

1110
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:12,015
Prosky: How about you?

1111
01:00:12,055 --> 01:00:15,650
Turk's voice: Our job is keeping
99% of the population safe

1112
01:00:15,692 --> 01:00:19,128
from the other 1%.

1113
01:00:19,162 --> 01:00:22,757
The problem is that we have to
spend half our lives with that 1%.

1114
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:24,596
And the better we do that job,

1115
01:00:24,634 --> 01:00:27,194
the less the other 99% think
they need us.

1116
01:00:27,237 --> 01:00:29,865
They're clueless.

1117
01:00:29,906 --> 01:00:31,840
The only ones paying attention
on the street

1118
01:00:31,875 --> 01:00:34,275
are the cops and the criminals.
Everyone else is just

1119
01:00:34,311 --> 01:00:37,075
going somewhere
or shopping.

1120
01:00:42,719 --> 01:00:44,914
- Umpire: Out.
- Come on.

1121
01:00:44,955 --> 01:00:47,446
l got an order here placing you
on restricted duty.

1122
01:00:47,490 --> 01:00:49,981
Now in plain English that means
you'll work at your desk.

1123
01:00:50,026 --> 01:00:52,085
You might want to cooperate
with the shrink

1124
01:00:52,128 --> 01:00:54,892
next time you two meet,
and you will meet again.

1125
01:00:58,835 --> 01:01:01,770
Cool my fucking heels.
Cool my fucking heels, huh?

1126
01:01:01,805 --> 01:01:04,535
l'm gonna blow a fucking hole
in that motherfucker Perez

1127
01:01:04,574 --> 01:01:07,441
and blow right through his head
for putting me through this bullshit.

1128
01:01:07,477 --> 01:01:09,377
- Turk.
- Fuck, l'm gonna...

1129
01:01:09,412 --> 01:01:10,709
kill that motherfucker.

1130
01:01:10,747 --> 01:01:13,545
Calm down. What the hell is it?
You're making all the wrong moves.

1131
01:01:13,583 --> 01:01:15,414
What are you talking about?
This ain't a chess game, partner.

1132
01:01:15,452 --> 01:01:17,886
Who knows? Maybe it is.
You go at Perez now--

1133
01:01:17,921 --> 01:01:20,412
you know what's gonna happen?
You're gonna walk right into a trap.

1134
01:01:20,457 --> 01:01:22,618
You are.
They're just waiting for you.

1135
01:01:22,659 --> 01:01:24,354
Fucking Hingis.

1136
01:01:24,394 --> 01:01:26,658
Fucking Hingis believes him.

1137
01:01:26,696 --> 01:01:29,688
He actually fucking believes
that motherfucking Perez.

1138
01:01:29,733 --> 01:01:31,223
Stay back. Wait.

1139
01:01:31,267 --> 01:01:34,703
Wait for the right time,
then fire away.

1140
01:01:34,738 --> 01:01:36,603
Not now. Now is not the right time.

1141
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:38,937
Believe me.

1142
01:01:38,975 --> 01:01:41,307
You believe me?
Now is not the time.

1143
01:01:41,344 --> 01:01:42,436
Uh-huh.

1144
01:01:42,479 --> 01:01:44,606
- Please.
- Yeah.

1145
01:01:44,647 --> 01:01:48,413
Hey, Turk, l gotta skip tonight.
My class ran late.

1146
01:01:48,451 --> 01:01:50,851
( over phone ) But l'll see you
tomorrow, all right?

1147
01:01:50,887 --> 01:01:53,788
And l'm sorry about what happened
with you and Lieutenant Hingis today.

1148
01:01:53,823 --> 01:01:55,950
lt's gonna be fine.
lt'll blow over.

1149
01:01:55,992 --> 01:01:58,927
People are just-- everyone's crazy.
People are overreacting.

1150
01:01:58,962 --> 01:02:01,624
All right? Good night.

1151
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:10,032
lt's a cop, it's a cop, it's a cop.

1152
01:02:16,813 --> 01:02:19,145
( car engine starts )

1153
01:02:19,182 --> 01:02:21,582
What you got for me, good-looking?

1154
01:02:26,790 --> 01:02:29,850
Mark my words, there's a reason
Perez is gunning for me.

1155
01:02:29,893 --> 01:02:32,623
- ( tenor singing )
- Perez is too smart to be that stupid.

1156
01:02:32,662 --> 01:02:35,290
For one thing, all that college-boy crap--
that's bullshit.

1157
01:02:35,331 --> 01:02:37,561
He did one year at SUNY,
only one year.

1158
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:38,589
No kidding.

1159
01:02:38,635 --> 01:02:41,035
They threw him out--
disruptive influence.

1160
01:02:41,071 --> 01:02:43,767
And l hear from the 240 he mixed it up bad
with a captain over there.

1161
01:02:43,807 --> 01:02:46,037
The guy is a total
fucking asshole.

1162
01:02:46,076 --> 01:02:47,907
( man with Russian accent )
BMW 3 series,

1163
01:02:47,944 --> 01:02:50,276
Mercedes CLK-- too light.

1164
01:02:50,313 --> 01:02:53,282
BMW 7 series--
the biggest engine.

1165
01:02:53,316 --> 01:02:55,978
That's what you have to get.
lf they shoot at you,

1166
01:02:56,019 --> 01:02:58,817
you still want
to get the fuck out of there...

1167
01:02:58,855 --> 01:03:00,516
( men laughing )

1168
01:03:00,557 --> 01:03:02,388
( imitating )
Bentley-- very good

1169
01:03:02,425 --> 01:03:05,189
because can fuck two prostitutes
in back seat

1170
01:03:05,228 --> 01:03:08,959
and mount flame-thrower
on the hood. Da?

1171
01:03:08,998 --> 01:03:10,329
Da.

1172
01:03:10,366 --> 01:03:12,698
- Man: What about a Cadillac?
- Russian: Come on,

1173
01:03:12,735 --> 01:03:16,227
the fucking car can't turn
fucking corner. Are you kidding me?

1174
01:03:16,272 --> 01:03:18,103
You know either one of those
Neanderthals?

1175
01:03:18,141 --> 01:03:20,905
The wop is Joe Scianci from Bensonhurst.
He's a mid-level guy.

1176
01:03:20,944 --> 01:03:22,878
What about lvan?

1177
01:03:22,912 --> 01:03:24,743
Russian guy,
Yevgeny Magulat,

1178
01:03:24,781 --> 01:03:28,911
an enforcer for the ltalians,
works with Gambinos a lot.

1179
01:03:30,086 --> 01:03:31,917
( speaking Russian )

1180
01:03:33,356 --> 01:03:36,018
That shit's getting to me.

1181
01:03:36,059 --> 01:03:38,084
l know it's getting to you.

1182
01:03:39,829 --> 01:03:42,263
Shit gets to me too, you know,

1183
01:03:42,298 --> 01:03:45,392
but l take it in, l let it out
on my own terms.

1184
01:03:47,003 --> 01:03:49,062
l bet you didn't write
one word down

1185
01:03:49,105 --> 01:03:51,005
in that little notebook
Prosky gave us.

1186
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:53,600
Of course not. Did you?

1187
01:03:53,643 --> 01:03:55,975
Yeah, it's great.

1188
01:03:57,547 --> 01:03:59,913
lt helps me put things in perspective.

1189
01:03:59,949 --> 01:04:03,942
You know what l'm saying?
Write it down, get it out.

1190
01:04:03,987 --> 01:04:06,512
- You should try this.
- Let's have a look.

1191
01:04:06,556 --> 01:04:09,184
What, are you kidding me?
Oh, come on, come on.

1192
01:04:09,225 --> 01:04:11,693
This belongs to me-- private.

1193
01:04:11,728 --> 01:04:16,097
- You don't want to let me see?
- Close to my heart. No, sir.

1194
01:04:16,132 --> 01:04:18,327
l just got sick
of the whole fucking game--

1195
01:04:18,368 --> 01:04:20,836
run around looking for clues,
making arrests,

1196
01:04:20,870 --> 01:04:23,395
write reports, testify, cut deals.

1197
01:04:23,439 --> 01:04:26,340
lt was all just so much
fucking bullshit.

1198
01:04:26,376 --> 01:04:29,209
( man whistles )

1199
01:04:29,245 --> 01:04:30,405
Detective--

1200
01:04:30,446 --> 01:04:32,471
( muffled gunshots )

1201
01:04:36,152 --> 01:04:37,551
Then it all got real simple.

1202
01:04:37,587 --> 01:04:40,613
Yeah, Detective Perez here.
Hey, brother, what's up?

1203
01:04:40,657 --> 01:04:43,592
l hate scumbags. l like shooting people.
What was l giving up?

1204
01:04:43,626 --> 01:04:46,618
Perez: Hey, look, l set the meeting up
with Rooster first thing tomorrow.

1205
01:04:46,663 --> 01:04:50,064
Come on, you gotta be fast, man.
l don't want Turk getting wind of anything.

1206
01:04:50,099 --> 01:04:52,465
A retirement party and a gold watch?

1207
01:04:52,502 --> 01:04:55,300
A handshake from the mayor
and my name on some fucking plaque?

1208
01:04:55,338 --> 01:04:58,068
( speaking indistinctly )

1209
01:04:58,107 --> 01:05:01,508
( gunshots )

1210
01:05:01,544 --> 01:05:02,738
Big fucking deal.

1211
01:05:04,981 --> 01:05:06,005
lt's better this way.

1212
01:05:07,817 --> 01:05:10,650
Now everybody knows
who l was and where l stood.

1213
01:05:50,693 --> 01:05:52,354
( dials )

1214
01:05:54,130 --> 01:05:56,121
Hey, it's me.

1215
01:05:57,600 --> 01:06:01,058
Listen, l think somebody
followed me here-- home.

1216
01:06:01,104 --> 01:06:03,572
He's outside right now.

1217
01:06:03,606 --> 01:06:07,303
Can you come over or--?

1218
01:06:07,343 --> 01:06:10,403
Just call me back, okay?
All right.

1219
01:06:25,695 --> 01:06:28,129
( intercom buzzing )

1220
01:06:35,838 --> 01:06:37,829
( cocks gun )

1221
01:06:40,576 --> 01:06:42,942
Don't move.

1222
01:06:55,825 --> 01:06:58,851
- Come on, open up.
- Turk?

1223
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:06,261
l just called you.

1224
01:07:06,302 --> 01:07:07,894
Put the gun down.

1225
01:07:07,937 --> 01:07:09,928
There's a car following me.

1226
01:07:09,972 --> 01:07:12,736
Put the gun down.
Put the gun down.

1227
01:07:16,646 --> 01:07:18,136
Have you got
something to tell me?

1228
01:07:18,181 --> 01:07:19,978
About what?

1229
01:07:20,016 --> 01:07:22,576
Trager, Randall.

1230
01:07:22,618 --> 01:07:24,609
Did you sneak
into my apartment?

1231
01:07:24,654 --> 01:07:26,645
What are they doing
on your computer?

1232
01:07:26,689 --> 01:07:28,919
l was checking
all the links in the case.

1233
01:07:32,261 --> 01:07:33,956
Are you hiding something
from me?

1234
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:38,758
Huh?

1235
01:07:40,269 --> 01:07:43,136
l just received this-- this poem.

1236
01:07:43,172 --> 01:07:45,766
A poem?
Not worth mentioning, huh?

1237
01:07:45,808 --> 01:07:48,333
The handwriting
doesn't even match.

1238
01:07:48,378 --> 01:07:50,573
lt's a fake.

1239
01:07:50,613 --> 01:07:52,604
Did you write it?

1240
01:07:54,450 --> 01:07:57,010
Did you write it?

1241
01:08:01,224 --> 01:08:03,784
What the hell is going on here?

1242
01:08:03,826 --> 01:08:05,987
You're spending a lot of time
with Perez, aren't you?

1243
01:08:06,028 --> 01:08:07,893
Yeah, l've been working the case.

1244
01:08:07,930 --> 01:08:10,091
What, are you jealous?

1245
01:08:10,133 --> 01:08:12,897
Can l trust you?

1246
01:08:15,037 --> 01:08:17,767
- Yes.
- Okay.

1247
01:08:17,807 --> 01:08:20,241
Get me anything and everything
that you can find out

1248
01:08:20,276 --> 01:08:22,710
about Perez or Riley,
what they know about me.

1249
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:26,278
Everything.

1250
01:08:26,315 --> 01:08:28,783
Karen, don't play me.

1251
01:08:30,052 --> 01:08:33,715
Hingis: l am leaning much further
into saying that it is a cop.

1252
01:08:33,756 --> 01:08:37,089
Perez: Tell you what-- l'm moving
past the leaning stage

1253
01:08:37,126 --> 01:08:39,924
and l'm moving towards the
l-know-for-sure-it's-a-fucking-cop stage,

1254
01:08:39,962 --> 01:08:42,294
considering how expertly
he shot the shit out of my house.

1255
01:08:42,331 --> 01:08:44,595
Hingis: Oh my God.
Are you hurt?

1256
01:08:44,634 --> 01:08:46,727
Am l hurt? Am l hurt?
He wants to know if l'm hurt.

1257
01:08:46,769 --> 01:08:48,304
Actually, he's dead.

1258
01:08:48,304 --> 01:08:50,966
( sirens wailing )

1259
01:08:51,007 --> 01:08:54,340
- Rooster: His name is Magulat.
- Turk: The guy we saw at Salerno's.

1260
01:08:54,377 --> 01:08:57,437
Yeah, he's in intensive care
at St. Luke's.

1261
01:08:57,480 --> 01:08:59,471
They think he's the guy

1262
01:08:59,515 --> 01:09:01,983
- chopped off Yakov Pearlstein's head.
- What do you think?

1263
01:09:02,018 --> 01:09:04,248
You think he's a victim,
or could he be our suspect?

1264
01:09:04,287 --> 01:09:07,313
l don't know, but either way
l think it's gonna be fun.

1265
01:09:08,357 --> 01:09:11,258
Doctor, what's the story?

1266
01:09:11,294 --> 01:09:14,286
He's one of the toughest human beings
l've ever come into contact with.

1267
01:09:14,330 --> 01:09:16,093
We took six bullets
out of him.

1268
01:09:16,132 --> 01:09:17,997
Six? Whoo!

1269
01:09:18,034 --> 01:09:20,798
Three from the night he was wounded,
three from previous shootings.

1270
01:09:20,837 --> 01:09:22,737
The man is a tank.

1271
01:09:22,772 --> 01:09:24,831
Do you mind if l talk to him
a little bit?

1272
01:09:24,874 --> 01:09:27,502
His jaw's wired shut,
but go ahead.

1273
01:09:27,543 --> 01:09:30,444
That's okay. l'll ask the questions.
He can just grunt.

1274
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:33,415
Hey, Yevgeny.

1275
01:09:33,449 --> 01:09:35,679
( snapping fingers )
Wake up.

1276
01:09:35,718 --> 01:09:40,417
That's it. Wake up,
you big fucking grizzly bear.

1277
01:09:40,456 --> 01:09:42,856
You don't speak Russian?

1278
01:09:42,892 --> 01:09:46,487
Swoboda. Swoboda. Swoboda.

1279
01:09:46,529 --> 01:09:49,020
Ron.

1280
01:09:51,634 --> 01:09:53,795
( moans )

1281
01:09:53,836 --> 01:09:57,067
l'm thinking this Russian killing machine
could be our first eyewitness.

1282
01:09:57,106 --> 01:09:59,802
( beeping more rapidly )

1283
01:09:59,842 --> 01:10:02,709
Wake up, gugumuck.
You can tell us who did this to you.

1284
01:10:06,949 --> 01:10:10,385
- ( grunting )
- Detective, l think that's enough.

1285
01:10:10,419 --> 01:10:13,877
Then you could tell us where you put
Yakov Pearlstein's head.

1286
01:10:15,258 --> 01:10:17,249
( laughs )

1287
01:10:17,293 --> 01:10:20,194
4-3, 4-3, l need a round-the-clock
security detail

1288
01:10:20,229 --> 01:10:24,495
on a patient Magulat,
M-A-gulat,

1289
01:10:24,534 --> 01:10:26,729
St. Luke's in the lCU.

1290
01:10:28,571 --> 01:10:32,439
# l wake up in the morning... #

1291
01:10:32,475 --> 01:10:35,740
ls this the number to call
to report a case of police brutality?

1292
01:10:35,778 --> 01:10:39,236
- Cat got your tongue?
- Out on bail again?

1293
01:10:39,282 --> 01:10:41,546
What, you think you can scare me,
little bitch? What do you want?

1294
01:10:41,584 --> 01:10:43,916
Be careful, Detective.
My taxes pay your salary.

1295
01:10:43,953 --> 01:10:46,547
You don't pay any fucking taxes,
you lowlife piece of shit.

1296
01:10:46,589 --> 01:10:48,955
- Get to the point, come on.
- One of your vics, Trager,

1297
01:10:48,991 --> 01:10:51,619
stole a whole lot of guns
down South.

1298
01:10:51,661 --> 01:10:53,754
Same guns are turning up
on your murder scenes.

1299
01:10:53,796 --> 01:10:55,093
So it's simple--

1300
01:10:55,131 --> 01:10:57,656
find stolen guns,
you got your guy.

1301
01:10:57,700 --> 01:10:59,531
So you know the guy?

1302
01:10:59,569 --> 01:11:02,367
Do you know if there's a cop out there
who might be a danger to the public?

1303
01:11:02,405 --> 01:11:05,169
l couldn't live with myself
if l just stood by and didn't say anything.

1304
01:11:05,207 --> 01:11:08,199
Look, l'm gonna give you
two seconds more. Give me yes or no.

1305
01:11:08,244 --> 01:11:11,179
Do you know the guy?
And when do l meet you to talk about it?

1306
01:11:11,213 --> 01:11:13,943
Friday, 9:00 PM, at my club.

1307
01:11:13,983 --> 01:11:15,143
l'll be there.

1308
01:11:15,184 --> 01:11:17,209
Man, there's dumb
and there's dumber,

1309
01:11:17,253 --> 01:11:19,721
but this is the motherfucking dumbest
right here, man.

1310
01:11:19,755 --> 01:11:21,916
Easy, son, easy.
lt's gonna be easy for you.

1311
01:11:21,958 --> 01:11:25,553
All you gotta do is be bait, that's all.
Be a little sardine for us, all right?

1312
01:11:25,595 --> 01:11:28,257
You help us-- we got you covered.
Your club doesn't get hassled

1313
01:11:28,297 --> 01:11:30,822
and you don't have a revolving door
in and out of jail.

1314
01:11:30,866 --> 01:11:32,458
Do we have a deal or not?

1315
01:11:32,501 --> 01:11:35,902
Yeah, but your boy come in here
and go Hannibal Lecter on my ass,

1316
01:11:35,938 --> 01:11:38,463
l don't want no Jodie fucking Foster
coming through the door.

1317
01:11:38,507 --> 01:11:40,338
l want the goddamn
Marine Corps, man.

1318
01:11:40,376 --> 01:11:44,005
# Since Color Me Badd was singing
''l wanna sex you up''... #

1319
01:11:47,516 --> 01:11:50,246
( footsteps )

1320
01:12:00,696 --> 01:12:02,721
( heart monitor beeping )

1321
01:12:13,042 --> 01:12:14,532
Evening, Detective.

1322
01:12:14,577 --> 01:12:17,780
You want one? lt's shit,
but it's better than nothing, right?

1323
01:12:17,780 --> 01:12:21,011
Turk's voice: As soon as l heard
the fucking Russian didn't die

1324
01:12:21,050 --> 01:12:23,314
l knew things would never
be the same.

1325
01:12:23,352 --> 01:12:25,513
l had to change the rules,

1326
01:12:25,554 --> 01:12:27,545
the strategy.

1327
01:12:27,590 --> 01:12:31,356
l had to be bold, do something
that could never be undone.

1328
01:12:39,201 --> 01:12:41,504
l went for the unforgivable.

1329
01:13:02,692 --> 01:13:04,683
( Karen grunting )

1330
01:13:08,597 --> 01:13:11,293
No. Please. No.

1331
01:13:13,436 --> 01:13:15,870
( crying )

1332
01:13:33,322 --> 01:13:36,189
Karen over phone: Did you hear
anything l just said?

1333
01:13:37,359 --> 01:13:41,090
How exactly could l be
blowing this out of proportion?

1334
01:13:41,130 --> 01:13:43,291
That psycho just assaulted me.

1335
01:13:43,332 --> 01:13:46,631
l am telling you
he is a classic sociopath.

1336
01:13:46,669 --> 01:13:48,796
Okay okay,
l'll look into it, all right?

1337
01:13:48,838 --> 01:13:50,328
l'll look into it.

1338
01:13:50,372 --> 01:13:52,533
You stay the hell away from here.
Understood?

1339
01:13:52,575 --> 01:13:54,372
Understood?

1340
01:13:56,445 --> 01:13:57,776
Fuck that.

1341
01:14:09,191 --> 01:14:11,489
Man: Check the ball,
check the ball.

1342
01:14:11,527 --> 01:14:12,960
( players chattering )

1343
01:14:12,995 --> 01:14:16,226
l got the ball. l got the ball. l got the ball.
Stay on him. Stay on him.

1344
01:14:16,265 --> 01:14:18,199
Karen: Excuse me,
l'm Detective Corelli.

1345
01:14:18,234 --> 01:14:21,169
- l need to see your reservation book.
- Woman: Sure. Help yourself.

1346
01:14:28,611 --> 01:14:30,841
- Thank you.
- Anytime.

1347
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:32,575
Yes, this is Detective Corelli.

1348
01:14:32,615 --> 01:14:35,049
l've been trying to reach
Detectives Perez and Riley

1349
01:14:35,084 --> 01:14:37,018
and l can't seem
to locate them.

1350
01:14:37,052 --> 01:14:40,044
- Perez: l like to party.
- That's nothing. l was into Kiss.

1351
01:14:40,089 --> 01:14:42,080
l used to run
around the house

1352
01:14:42,124 --> 01:14:44,251
with my tongue hanging out,
spitting fake blood.

1353
01:14:44,293 --> 01:14:45,590
l need to speak to them
urgently.

1354
01:14:45,628 --> 01:14:47,823
( police siren whooping )

1355
01:14:49,431 --> 01:14:52,832
Yes, l understand,
but l need the location, please.

1356
01:15:16,892 --> 01:15:18,189
( buzzes )

1357
01:15:21,397 --> 01:15:23,888
Hey, he's here.

1358
01:15:23,933 --> 01:15:25,127
Turk: Let me in.

1359
01:15:30,606 --> 01:15:30,673
Thank God it's the police.

1360
01:15:30,673 --> 01:15:32,903
Thank God it's the police.

1361
01:15:32,942 --> 01:15:35,274
Yeah, so where do we go?

1362
01:15:35,311 --> 01:15:37,245
Follow me.

1363
01:15:37,279 --> 01:15:39,577
l used to play ball
a couple of blocks from here.

1364
01:15:39,615 --> 01:15:40,843
Get the fuck out of here.

1365
01:15:40,883 --> 01:15:43,818
When l was a kid l wasn't afraid
to mix it up with guys like you.

1366
01:15:43,853 --> 01:15:45,150
You still ain't.

1367
01:15:45,187 --> 01:15:47,712
Yeah, nowadays
l carry a gun with me.

1368
01:15:47,756 --> 01:15:51,021
lt's a bad neighborhood.

1369
01:15:51,060 --> 01:15:53,051
- lt ain't bad for me.
- Yeah, well...

1370
01:15:53,095 --> 01:15:55,495
Yeah, he's inside.

1371
01:15:55,531 --> 01:15:57,089
Well, so far so good.

1372
01:15:57,132 --> 01:15:59,726
So now that we're done with
the pleasantries, what do you got for me?

1373
01:15:59,768 --> 01:16:00,996
Rooster: He's talking.

1374
01:16:01,036 --> 01:16:03,027
- What did you think he was gonna do?
- Spider: How about an apology?

1375
01:16:03,072 --> 01:16:05,836
Spider: The shit that happened to Stubby,
that wasn't supposed to happen.

1376
01:16:05,875 --> 01:16:09,402
- Rooster: Lieutenant, that's a crock of shit.
- l lost three fucking teeth that day.

1377
01:16:09,445 --> 01:16:11,709
He's not a civilian.
He's a fucking dealer.

1378
01:16:11,747 --> 01:16:13,806
- And l kept my mouth shut.
- So what?

1379
01:16:13,849 --> 01:16:17,148
You guys love those stupid gold teeth.
You should thank me.

1380
01:16:17,186 --> 01:16:20,019
Well, he's wearing a vest
and Starsky and Hutch here

1381
01:16:20,055 --> 01:16:23,081
are watching him like a couple
of hawks-- gay hawks.

1382
01:16:23,125 --> 01:16:26,288
- Yeah, right there, buddy.
- ( chuckles )

1383
01:16:26,328 --> 01:16:29,297
All right, enough bullshit.
So you know our poetry boy?

1384
01:16:29,331 --> 01:16:31,322
Just talk to me.
What do you got for me?

1385
01:16:31,367 --> 01:16:33,426
- All right, here we go.
- Here we go.

1386
01:16:33,469 --> 01:16:34,936
Would you please?

1387
01:16:34,970 --> 01:16:37,803
Just 'cause the guy's talking tough,
that don't mean shit.

1388
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:39,637
Let me ask you something,
Copernicus.

1389
01:16:39,675 --> 01:16:42,269
That gun on his belt--
do you think it's a service pistol?

1390
01:16:42,311 --> 01:16:44,973
l bet you we'll trace it back to Trager's.
What do you think about that?

1391
01:16:45,014 --> 01:16:46,743
- What do you want to bet?
- 500 bucks.

1392
01:16:46,782 --> 01:16:48,909
- You're on.
- l'm in for another five.

1393
01:16:48,951 --> 01:16:51,317
Oh, this is fun.

1394
01:16:51,353 --> 01:16:53,548
Look, l help you,

1395
01:16:53,589 --> 01:16:55,056
So help me.

1396
01:16:55,090 --> 01:16:57,388
All right, you might see
a little bit of a cell-phone video.

1397
01:16:57,426 --> 01:16:59,485
l got it in front of Trager's
the night he bought it.

1398
01:16:59,528 --> 01:17:01,462
- You got what?
- l got a movie--

1399
01:17:01,497 --> 01:17:04,989
a couple of kids back from the prom,
preserving their special memories,

1400
01:17:05,034 --> 01:17:06,729
a positive lD of you, big time.

1401
01:17:06,769 --> 01:17:08,930
- Oh, yeah? Of me?
- Yeah.

1402
01:17:08,971 --> 01:17:10,700
Okay.

1403
01:17:10,739 --> 01:17:12,263
Now you know

1404
01:17:12,308 --> 01:17:14,674
Yeah, now l got it.

01:17:14,710 --> 01:17:16,644
Yeah, well,
so how do l look?

1406
01:17:19,715 --> 01:17:21,273
Like a poet?

1407
01:17:22,284 --> 01:17:23,945
'Cause that's what l am,
you know, a poet.

1408
01:17:23,986 --> 01:17:26,682
All right, come on, let's go.

1409
01:17:26,722 --> 01:17:29,350
ln fact, l wrote a poem for you, Spider.
Want to hear it?

1410
01:17:29,391 --> 01:17:31,325
Eh?

1411
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:33,590
( cocks gun )

1412
01:17:33,629 --> 01:17:35,153
( door crashes open )

1413
01:17:35,197 --> 01:17:38,689
Drop your gun right now, motherfucker!
Drop to the ground right now!

1414
01:17:38,734 --> 01:17:40,565
Oh! Oh! Grease me up and--

1415
01:17:40,602 --> 01:17:42,661
l mean, do they actually pay
you two morons?

1416
01:17:42,705 --> 01:17:45,970
- Put the fucking weapon on the ground.
- Gladly. Gladly. Right there.

1417
01:17:46,008 --> 01:17:47,976
Right there. There you go.

1418
01:17:49,144 --> 01:17:51,044
Hey, you want to read my poem?

1419
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:52,513
Easy easy.

1420
01:17:52,548 --> 01:17:53,845
Here, read it.

1421
01:17:56,018 --> 01:17:58,282
''You tried to set me up, you fucks,

1422
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:00,117
And this is how you do it?

1423
01:18:00,155 --> 01:18:02,885
You thought l'd get
my dick cut off,

1424
01:18:02,925 --> 01:18:05,485
lnstead you only blew it.''

1425
01:18:05,527 --> 01:18:07,552
- ( both laugh )
- Great stuff.

1426
01:18:07,596 --> 01:18:09,962
- What is that shit?
- Thank you.

1427
01:18:09,999 --> 01:18:12,433
That is poetry.

1428
01:18:12,468 --> 01:18:14,197
What are you doing here?

1429
01:18:14,236 --> 01:18:16,067
Well, don't look at me, partner,

1430
01:18:16,105 --> 01:18:18,596
but l tagged along
to protect your ass

1431
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:21,973
and to see the look on their faces.
lt was worth it.

1432
01:18:22,011 --> 01:18:24,377
We're doing our jobs here, okay?
l'm not gonna apologize for that.

1433
01:18:24,413 --> 01:18:27,041
l never want you to apologize, Teddy.
There's a killer out there with a badge.

1434
01:18:27,082 --> 01:18:29,243
- What are you morons doing about it?
- What do you think we're doing here?

1435
01:18:29,284 --> 01:18:31,149
- That's not it.
- No, that's not it.

1436
01:18:31,186 --> 01:18:33,086
l just made 1000 bucks.

1437
01:18:33,122 --> 01:18:34,987
Where's the other gun?
Give it to me.

1438
01:18:35,024 --> 01:18:36,821
Why don't you frisk me, Sherlock?
Go ahead.

1439
01:18:36,859 --> 01:18:39,054
- Frisk me, go ahead. Go ahead.
- Yeah, l'm gonna frisk you.

1440
01:18:42,131 --> 01:18:44,793
Ooh, nice touch, Mary.

1441
01:18:44,833 --> 01:18:46,994
What are you doing after work?
Unless you're committed.

1442
01:18:47,036 --> 01:18:49,266
l don't want to get
in the middle of anything.

1443
01:18:49,304 --> 01:18:52,535
What happened to your face?
Your mick friend give you a little love bite?

1444
01:18:52,574 --> 01:18:55,941
- Shut the fuck up. Shut your fucking face.
- Hey hey hey! Whoa!

1445
01:18:55,978 --> 01:18:58,708
l'll blow your brains out
if you don't get the fuck away.

1446
01:18:58,747 --> 01:19:00,908
- What's he talking about?
- ( all yelling )

1447
01:19:00,949 --> 01:19:02,746
- What's he talking about?
- What he's talking about is,

1448
01:19:02,785 --> 01:19:05,117
just 'cause you didn't go for this
doesn't mean you're not our guy.

1449
01:19:05,154 --> 01:19:07,520
- Now we gotta break this shit up.
- Don't translate for me, man.

1450
01:19:07,556 --> 01:19:10,184
Rooster: Will you let this go?
You fucked up, okay?

1451
01:19:10,225 --> 01:19:12,750
- We fucked up 'cause you helped him.
- l'm gonna nail your ass.

1452
01:19:12,795 --> 01:19:15,161
l'm not through with you, man.
Make a mistake.

1453
01:19:15,197 --> 01:19:17,188
Rooster: l'm gonna
break this stuff down, okay?

1454
01:19:17,232 --> 01:19:19,462
You fucking dog.

1455
01:19:21,003 --> 01:19:23,767
Relax, Spider.

1456
01:19:23,806 --> 01:19:26,138
Come on, let's have a drink.

1457
01:19:26,175 --> 01:19:29,736
l saw what l think
is a refrigerator here.

1458
01:19:33,949 --> 01:19:35,610
l'll be back in a second.

1459
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:46,050
Hey, muffinhead.

1460
01:19:49,264 --> 01:19:50,731
ls this the person
who shot you?

1461
01:19:51,733 --> 01:19:53,667
You're sure?

1462
01:19:57,372 --> 01:19:59,363
( chuckles )

1463
01:19:59,408 --> 01:20:01,433
No, you're the pumpkinhead.

1464
01:20:06,782 --> 01:20:08,773
( Spider chuckling )

1465
01:20:12,688 --> 01:20:14,656
You miss me?

1466
01:20:16,692 --> 01:20:19,024
''...of death and pain,

1467
01:20:19,061 --> 01:20:21,222
Place oneself among the slain.

1468
01:20:21,263 --> 01:20:23,788
lf one addiction goes unfed,

1469
01:20:23,832 --> 01:20:26,130
The world is better with him dead.''

1470
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:45,948
Take it easy.

1471
01:20:45,988 --> 01:20:47,751
lt's okay.
lt's gonna be all right.

1472
01:20:47,789 --> 01:20:50,019
Jesus Christ, Rooster.

1473
01:20:50,058 --> 01:20:52,925
Just move into the room. Here.

1474
01:20:52,961 --> 01:20:55,429
Sit down. Sit down.

1475
01:20:58,333 --> 01:21:00,324
Okay.

1476
01:21:00,369 --> 01:21:04,066
You gotta know about this,
Tom, from me.

1477
01:21:04,106 --> 01:21:07,200
Now just open that little book,
start reading.

1478
01:21:07,242 --> 01:21:09,710
Everything you want to know
is in there.

1479
01:21:11,747 --> 01:21:13,738
So go ahead.

1480
01:21:15,317 --> 01:21:17,308
Out loud.

1481
01:21:18,654 --> 01:21:20,747
For the record.

1482
01:21:20,789 --> 01:21:23,553
See the little video here?

1483
01:21:29,965 --> 01:21:33,332
''My name is David Fisk,
Detective First Grade.

1484
01:21:33,368 --> 01:21:37,429

for nearly 30 years.''

1485
01:21:38,540 --> 01:21:42,067
- Dave, Dave, Dave, Dave.
- Tom,

1486
01:21:42,110 --> 01:21:45,204
we've got a lot to cover
and not much time to do it in, so...

1487
01:21:48,483 --> 01:21:51,680
''My name is David Fisk,
Detective First Grade.''

1488
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:54,245
My name is David Fisk.

1489
01:21:54,289 --> 01:21:57,315
''l've been a cop in the NYPD
for nearly 30 years.''

1490
01:21:57,359 --> 01:22:00,226
l don't expect you
to remember me.

1491
01:22:00,262 --> 01:22:02,287
l mean, it's been a long time

1492
01:22:02,331 --> 01:22:06,131
since you sat me on your lap
and told me you loved me.

1493
01:22:06,168 --> 01:22:09,228
''ln that time

1494
01:22:09,271 --> 01:22:12,001
l've killed 14 people.''

1495
01:22:13,108 --> 01:22:15,099
Rooster: But l guarantee

1496
01:22:15,143 --> 01:22:18,306
you're gonna remember the name
for the rest of your life.

1497
01:22:28,824 --> 01:22:32,419
''You don't become a cop
because you want to serve and protect.

1498
01:22:33,862 --> 01:22:36,922
You join the force because they let you
carry a gun and a badge.

1499
01:22:36,965 --> 01:22:39,627
Most people respect the badge.

1500
01:22:39,668 --> 01:22:41,761
Everybody respects the gun.''

1501
01:22:41,803 --> 01:22:44,636
l'm the killer.
l show up at your door.

1502
01:22:44,673 --> 01:22:47,506
Turk: What are you talking about?
lt's not a fucking chess game.

1503
01:22:47,542 --> 01:22:50,636
Who knows? Maybe it is.
You're making all the wrong moves.

1504
01:22:50,679 --> 01:22:52,874
l'm gonna put two
through his fucking head

1505
01:22:52,914 --> 01:22:55,246
myself.

1506
01:22:55,284 --> 01:22:57,445
l know it to a moral certainty.

1507
01:22:57,486 --> 01:23:00,011
You sort of get numb to it.

1508
01:23:09,564 --> 01:23:12,294
''Tom Cowen was my role model.

1509
01:23:22,377 --> 01:23:24,675
The day l stopped trying to be him

1510
01:23:24,713 --> 01:23:27,045
was the greatest day of my life.

1511
01:23:31,086 --> 01:23:34,385
Several years back l framed
a lowlife child killer

1512
01:23:34,423 --> 01:23:37,085
named Charles Randall.

1513
01:23:38,860 --> 01:23:41,260
l should have known
it would come back to haunt me.''

1514
01:23:45,467 --> 01:23:47,833
What do you want me
to do with this?

1515
01:23:49,638 --> 01:23:52,072
ls that all you got to say?

1516
01:23:52,107 --> 01:23:54,337
l owe you this explanation, pal.

1517
01:23:54,376 --> 01:23:56,401
Why are you telling me now?

1518
01:23:56,445 --> 01:24:00,779
lvan the Terrible
is gonna wake up pretty soon

1519
01:24:00,816 --> 01:24:02,613
and he's gonna lD me.

1520
01:24:08,190 --> 01:24:10,021
Evening, Detective.

1521
01:24:10,058 --> 01:24:13,027
You want one? lt's shit,
but it's better than nothing, right?

1522
01:24:13,061 --> 01:24:17,225
l can just walk right in here.
Your partner's asleep. Step outside.

1523
01:24:17,265 --> 01:24:20,098
Did l ever pick
the wrong fucking Russki to shoot?

1524
01:24:29,478 --> 01:24:31,878
Now we're going off the record.

1525
01:24:34,416 --> 01:24:38,216
Uh, l'm going to take the rap
for the Randall gun thing.

1526
01:24:38,253 --> 01:24:40,084
You saw that.

1527
01:24:40,122 --> 01:24:43,285
l mean, considering
the circumstances, why not?

1528
01:24:43,325 --> 01:24:45,793
No need to thank me.

1529
01:24:46,995 --> 01:24:48,929
That business about not being me--

1530
01:24:48,964 --> 01:24:50,454
Yeah.

1531
01:24:50,499 --> 01:24:52,467
l don't get that.

1532
01:24:52,501 --> 01:24:56,494
Well, you're a great cop, Tom.

1533
01:24:56,538 --> 01:24:58,529
l mean, you were the one

1534
01:24:58,573 --> 01:25:01,633
l aspired to all my life
and could never be.

1535
01:25:03,211 --> 01:25:05,611
Then you broke the law,

1536
01:25:05,647 --> 01:25:08,810
planted the gun on Randall,

1537
01:25:08,850 --> 01:25:12,115
let me down.

1538
01:25:13,855 --> 01:25:15,789
l lost my faith.

1539
01:25:17,359 --> 01:25:21,318
That's when it all started.

1540
01:25:21,363 --> 01:25:24,025
And once it did,

1541
01:25:24,065 --> 01:25:26,090
l couldn't stop.

1542
01:25:27,469 --> 01:25:31,166
Finally,

1543
01:25:31,206 --> 01:25:33,697
l didn't want to.

1544
01:25:40,115 --> 01:25:43,676
So l did my own thing.

1545
01:25:43,718 --> 01:25:46,312
And you know what? ln the end

1546
01:25:46,354 --> 01:25:48,652
it got done.

1547
01:25:48,690 --> 01:25:51,215
The scum went down.

1548
01:25:51,259 --> 01:25:53,124
And that's it. That's that.

1549
01:25:54,663 --> 01:25:56,961
l don't understand
a word you said,

1550
01:25:56,998 --> 01:25:59,159
- don't understand any of it.
- l know you don't, Tom.

1551
01:25:59,201 --> 01:26:01,897
As soon as l heard
the Russian didn't die

1552
01:26:01,937 --> 01:26:04,303
l knew l had to change the rules,

1553
01:26:04,339 --> 01:26:07,172
do something that could
never be undone.

1554
01:26:07,209 --> 01:26:09,268
l went for the unforgivable.

1555
01:26:12,981 --> 01:26:14,505
No.

1556
01:26:15,984 --> 01:26:18,248
So what am l gonna do, my friend,

1557
01:26:18,286 --> 01:26:20,914
partner? Arrest you?

1558
01:26:20,956 --> 01:26:23,823
At some point l gotta call it in.

1559
01:26:23,859 --> 01:26:25,258
We're a team.

1560
01:26:25,293 --> 01:26:26,988
We were.

1561
01:26:27,028 --> 01:26:29,019
Yeah, we were, a great team.

1562
01:26:29,064 --> 01:26:31,555
That was yesterday, Dave.

1563
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:32,726
Today--

1564
01:26:34,836 --> 01:26:37,805
today you're pointing a gun at me.

1565
01:26:42,244 --> 01:26:45,372
( cocks gun )
But it hasn't gone off yet.

1566
01:26:50,752 --> 01:26:52,242
Bye, Tom.

1567
01:26:52,287 --> 01:26:54,380
- Where are you going?
- l don't know.

1568
01:26:54,422 --> 01:26:57,425
To hell, l suppose.

1569
01:27:44,105 --> 01:27:46,130
- Hey, Dave, Dave.
- Whoa.

1570
01:27:46,174 --> 01:27:48,734
Don't come closer!

1571
01:27:48,777 --> 01:27:51,109
- You wouldn't.
- You want to bet your life on it?

1572
01:27:51,146 --> 01:27:53,114
Come on, partner, l know you.
You wouldn't.

1573
01:27:53,148 --> 01:27:55,514
( Karen cocks gun )
But l would.

1574
01:27:55,550 --> 01:27:56,778
Oh.

1575
01:27:56,818 --> 01:27:58,809
Karen, just take it easy.

1576
01:27:58,853 --> 01:28:00,878
- Can't get me out of your mind?
- Shut up, Dave.

1577
01:28:00,922 --> 01:28:04,949
You're gonna defend
this lowlife piece of shit?

1578
01:28:04,993 --> 01:28:07,928
- Boy, l'm in your head.
- l'm not defending him. Take it easy.

1579
01:28:07,963 --> 01:28:11,126
Fuck you, Turk.
Put the gun down, Fisk.

1580
01:28:11,166 --> 01:28:12,633
- And if l don't?
- Dave.

1581
01:28:12,667 --> 01:28:15,431
- How about l blow your brains out?
- Ooh, l like the sound of that.

1582
01:28:15,470 --> 01:28:17,404
- Don't move.
- Karen.

1583
01:28:17,439 --> 01:28:19,839
You blow me away, Turk dies.
ls that your idea?

1584
01:28:19,874 --> 01:28:21,205
l said don't move, you prick.

1585
01:28:21,242 --> 01:28:23,540
Bye-bye!

1586
01:28:25,213 --> 01:28:26,805
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun.

1587
01:28:28,483 --> 01:28:30,178
Stay here.

1588
01:28:36,958 --> 01:28:38,357
Oh, man.

1589
01:28:39,694 --> 01:28:40,956
Fuck.

1590
01:28:42,497 --> 01:28:44,397
- ( train passing )
- These old locks--

1591
01:28:44,432 --> 01:28:46,127
l mean, they're good.

1592
01:28:46,167 --> 01:28:48,135
Dave, you've got to end
this thing.

1593
01:28:48,169 --> 01:28:50,228
End it?

1594
01:28:50,271 --> 01:28:51,568
Put the gun down.

1595
01:28:51,606 --> 01:28:54,404
What's your plan?

1596
01:28:54,442 --> 01:28:56,740
Are you gonna arrest me?

1597
01:28:56,778 --> 01:28:59,611
Are you gonna take me down
to the precinct, book me,

1598
01:28:59,648 --> 01:29:03,311
fingerprint me,
body-cavity-search me?

1599
01:29:03,351 --> 01:29:05,216
What the fuck
are you gonna do?

1600
01:29:05,253 --> 01:29:08,188
wheel me out on the ''Geraldo'' show,
a freak of the week?

1601
01:29:08,223 --> 01:29:12,922
Or better yet, an in-depth
psycho profile on ''Oprah''?

1602
01:29:12,961 --> 01:29:15,259
Are you ready for that?
lt ain't gonna fly, man.

1603
01:29:15,296 --> 01:29:17,662
Dave, you give me no choice.

1604
01:29:17,699 --> 01:29:19,530
You got a choice-- l escape.

1605
01:29:21,102 --> 01:29:23,366
Would you do that for me, Tom?

1606
01:29:24,472 --> 01:29:25,700
Would you let me escape?

1607
01:29:25,740 --> 01:29:27,264
Come on, don't do this.

1608
01:29:27,308 --> 01:29:29,640
l'm gonna make a run for it.

1609
01:29:29,678 --> 01:29:31,873
What do you think?

1610
01:29:31,913 --> 01:29:34,905
You gotta do the right thing.

1611
01:29:40,922 --> 01:29:42,981
That's a 10-10, partner--

1612
01:29:43,024 --> 01:29:46,391
shots fired, suspect fleeing.
Let's go!

1613
01:29:46,428 --> 01:29:48,055
Come on, don't go there.

1614
01:29:49,564 --> 01:29:52,624
Hey, partner, come on.
Shots fired.

1615
01:29:52,667 --> 01:29:55,101
- Don't do this.
- Suspect fleeing,

1616
01:29:55,136 --> 01:29:57,570
resisting arrest. Come on.

1617
01:30:06,981 --> 01:30:09,882
A righteous man

1618
01:30:09,918 --> 01:30:12,648
Before me stands,

1619
01:30:12,687 --> 01:30:17,056
A hero in these filthy lands.

1620
01:30:17,092 --> 01:30:20,493
A brother in arms,

1621
01:30:20,528 --> 01:30:23,986
ln heart are you.

1622
01:30:24,032 --> 01:30:26,694
l was really hoping

1623
01:30:26,735 --> 01:30:29,397
You'd get it too.

1624
01:30:32,874 --> 01:30:35,434
- l do get it.
- No, you don't.

1625
01:30:35,477 --> 01:30:37,411
No, l get it.

1626
01:30:43,752 --> 01:30:47,017
You know, the only thing
in this life

1627
01:30:47,055 --> 01:30:49,888
that ever gave me
any satisfaction

1628
01:30:49,924 --> 01:30:51,824

1629
01:30:53,762 --> 01:30:56,094
So this is for real.

1630
01:30:56,131 --> 01:30:58,497

1631
01:30:58,533 --> 01:31:00,865

- You sure on that?
- Sure on that.

1651
01:32:50,178 --> 01:32:52,544
You did this, you know.

l know, partner, l know.

1653
01:33:00,722 --> 01:33:02,553
We did good, Tom.

1654
01:33:03,791 --> 01:33:06,225
Tom, Tommy.

1655
01:33:06,261 --> 01:33:09,992
We did good. We did good.

1656
01:33:11,699 --> 01:33:14,429
You're a good man, Tom.

1657
01:33:14,469 --> 01:33:16,903
You're a good man.

1658

continued success.

1661
01:34:08,489 --> 01:34:10,650
Some piece of work, your partner.

1662
01:34:10,692 --> 01:34:12,683
Lights.

1663
01:34:12,727 --> 01:34:14,524
Look, Cowen,

1664
01:34:14,562 --> 01:34:17,224
the way we see it,

1665
01:34:17,265 --> 01:34:20,234
Detective Fisk just closed the door
on the poetry boy.

1666
01:34:27,175 --> 01:34:30,338
Good. Whatever you say.

1667
01:34:33,181 --> 01:34:35,649
Are we done?

1668
01:34:35,683 --> 01:34:37,708
Yeah, we're done.

1669
01:34:43,558 --> 01:34:45,719
( children playing )

1670
01:34:59,807 --> 01:35:01,638
Turk's voice: My daughter called.

1671
01:35:01,676 --> 01:35:05,339
She was upset about Rooster
and worried about me.

1672
01:35:05,380 --> 01:35:08,941
She asked me if l was likely
to do something stupid

1673
01:35:08,983 --> 01:35:11,543
and l said, ''Like what,

1674
01:35:11,586 --> 01:35:14,612
take anger management classes
or retire?''

1675
01:35:14,655 --> 01:35:17,920
l said l was gonna do
the same old thing l always do.

1676
01:35:17,959 --> 01:35:21,861
She said, ''Good.
What else could you do?''

1677
01:35:21,896 --> 01:35:23,557
l said, ''Right.''

1678
01:35:23,598 --> 01:35:26,624
A real chip off the old block,
my daughter.

1679
01:35:26,667 --> 01:35:29,898
She said l was a cop
and a good one.

1680
01:35:29,937 --> 01:35:33,498
Funny-- Rooster said
the same thing.

1681
01:35:36,611 --> 01:35:39,876
Turk: Okay, guys,
let's get ready to play ball.

1682
01:35:39,914 --> 01:35:43,748
On the count of three.
Everybody in?

1683
01:35:43,785 --> 01:35:47,346
One, two, three, explosion!

1684
01:36:00,034 --> 01:36:00,234
( instrumental music playing )
