1
00:01:21,334 --> 00:01:22,626
One

2
00:01:22,668 --> 00:01:24,128
between the eyes!

3
00:01:24,169 --> 00:01:26,296
Two

4
00:01:26,338 --> 00:01:28,423
between the eyes.

5
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,202
- Out!
- What?

6
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,540
- She was safe.
- She was out.

7
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,500
She landed right there.
She's safe.

8
00:02:09,127 --> 00:02:10,796
Turk: Aw, come on.

9
00:02:10,837 --> 00:02:13,506
Umpire: That's enough.
I don't want to hear another word.

10
00:02:13,548 --> 00:02:15,800
- You're gone!
- Yeah, I'm gone.

11
00:02:23,307 --> 00:02:26,351
My grandmother used to take me
to Washington Square Park...

12
00:02:28,186 --> 00:02:30,647
to watch Bobby Fischer
play 10 games at the same time.

13
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:32,732
Queen me.

14
00:02:32,774 --> 00:02:35,735
He was five-six moves ahead
on each table.

15
00:02:36,736 --> 00:02:39,197
Anyway, he became
the world champ, didn't he?

16
00:02:39,238 --> 00:02:41,282
Then he lost his fucking mind.

17
00:02:44,618 --> 00:02:47,246
He became a raving paranoid.

18
00:02:47,287 --> 00:02:49,039
Being attacked
from all directions,

19
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:51,082
he couldn't see
what was in front of him.

20
00:02:58,214 --> 00:03:00,424
Mate. Mate!

21
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:22,903
(both laugh)

22
00:03:30,786 --> 00:03:33,288
My name is david Fisk,

23
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,498
detective First Grade.

24
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:39,585
I've been a cop in the NYPd
for over 30 years.

25
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,255
In that time...

26
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,342
I've killed 14 people.

27
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:51,221
Man: Run that by me
one more time.

28
00:03:52,222 --> 00:03:54,808
I've killed 14 people.

29
00:03:54,849 --> 00:03:56,476
He's nuts.

30
00:03:58,978 --> 00:04:01,188
Turk's voice: When did
these things start?

31
00:04:05,317 --> 00:04:07,486
How did they start?

32
00:04:12,574 --> 00:04:15,869
Maybe this one started
with a guy named Charles Randall.

33
00:04:21,457 --> 00:04:24,376
Randall was a child killer.

34
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,547
He killed his girlfriend's daughter

35
00:04:28,589 --> 00:04:31,007
about four years ago.

36
00:04:32,342 --> 00:04:34,344
Randall: Fuck you, damn asshole.

37
00:04:35,637 --> 00:04:37,263
Turk's voice: He was tried
for the crime,

38
00:04:37,305 --> 00:04:39,765
but was acquitted
by a jury of his peers.

39
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:57,407
My partner and I
found this unacceptable.

40
00:05:01,202 --> 00:05:04,163
My partner is a good man.

41
00:05:25,182 --> 00:05:27,768
Are you really
gonna do this thing?

42
00:05:27,809 --> 00:05:29,853
Do what?

43
00:05:29,895 --> 00:05:32,314
You're going to
take down Randall

44
00:05:32,355 --> 00:05:34,524
for a homicide
he didn't commit.

45
00:05:39,403 --> 00:05:41,739
What am I gonna do?

46
00:05:41,781 --> 00:05:43,782
You're my partner.

47
00:05:43,824 --> 00:05:46,201
- You're my role model.
- Right.

48
00:05:46,243 --> 00:05:48,245
What am I gonna do
without a role model?

49
00:05:51,665 --> 00:05:54,459
We didn't have
this conversation.

50
00:05:54,501 --> 00:05:56,961
What conversation?

51
00:06:16,104 --> 00:06:17,855
Turk's voice: It got done.

52
00:06:22,151 --> 00:06:25,195
Randall lost his freedom

53
00:06:25,237 --> 00:06:27,239
for the crime he didn't commit.

54
00:06:33,078 --> 00:06:35,163
Turk's voice: I lost my faith.

55
00:06:37,832 --> 00:06:40,376
- I'm gonna go.
- Okay.

56
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:50,469
You can take this
as a confession if you want.

57
00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:53,430
You can take this
as a confession if you want.

58
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,431
Whatever.

59
00:06:55,473 --> 00:06:58,267
A few weeks ago
things heated up.

60
00:06:58,309 --> 00:07:00,061
What do we got on him, Turk?

61
00:07:00,102 --> 00:07:04,523
Marcus Smith, AKA Spider...
big big dope deals,

62
00:07:04,565 --> 00:07:06,984
murders, extortion,
lots of nice things.

63
00:07:07,025 --> 00:07:09,361
He converted
this old abandoned bank

64
00:07:09,403 --> 00:07:11,530
into Club 404 of Harlem.

65
00:07:11,571 --> 00:07:13,198
Maybe when he sees us
he'll confess.

66
00:07:13,239 --> 00:07:15,200
What, you don't believe
in miracles?

67
00:07:15,241 --> 00:07:16,826
When you pick up a check
one day...

68
00:07:16,868 --> 00:07:19,203
one day,
then I'll believe in miracles.

69
00:07:19,245 --> 00:07:22,373
- Let's go. I'm buying.
- Yeah, that's a miracle I want to see.

70
00:07:22,415 --> 00:07:25,250
(crowd chattering,
distant music playing)

71
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,046
(hip-hop music playing)
#We fly high, no lie #

72
00:07:29,087 --> 00:07:32,048
#You hear that?
You know this, balling #

73
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:35,051
#Foreign rides outside #

74
00:07:35,093 --> 00:07:37,136
#It's like showbiz,
we in the building #

75
00:07:37,178 --> 00:07:39,388
#We stay fly, no lie... #

76
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,182
Turk: This is where he launders
his money.

77
00:07:41,223 --> 00:07:45,185
Rooster: Oh, yeah,
cleaning green green green.

78
00:07:45,227 --> 00:07:47,437
Turk: He's all business.

79
00:07:48,855 --> 00:07:50,649
I gotta take a leak.

80
00:08:00,408 --> 00:08:02,576
Oh, I'll just be a sec.

81
00:08:02,618 --> 00:08:04,078
I'm not peeking.

82
00:08:04,119 --> 00:08:06,497
No problem.

83
00:08:11,042 --> 00:08:13,586
- You guys are so lucky.
- Why is that?

84
00:08:13,628 --> 00:08:15,922
No line to the bathroom and...

85
00:08:15,964 --> 00:08:17,840
(sniffs)

86
00:08:17,882 --> 00:08:20,092
You get to pee standing up.

87
00:08:20,134 --> 00:08:21,969
Unzip, psss, zip.

88
00:08:22,011 --> 00:08:24,263
Badda boom badda bing,
you're out of here.

89
00:08:24,305 --> 00:08:28,725
Yeah, the big guy really outdid himself
on this thing.

90
00:08:28,725 --> 00:08:30,102
You want a bump?

91
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:32,062
Where did you get that from?

92
00:08:32,103 --> 00:08:34,564
Spider. Supremo.

93
00:08:38,734 --> 00:08:41,195
(train whistle blows)

94
00:09:03,757 --> 00:09:05,718
(door closes)

95
00:09:18,688 --> 00:09:20,690
(muffled screams)

96
00:09:20,731 --> 00:09:23,234
(crash, thumping)

97
00:09:35,954 --> 00:09:37,955
(sighs)

98
00:09:43,002 --> 00:09:44,962
Not bad.

99
00:09:45,004 --> 00:09:48,298
Turk: Not bad?
What the fuck were you looking for?

100
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,717
Come on, Turk,

101
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:52,761
you pulled my hair.

102
00:09:52,802 --> 00:09:55,972
Gee, my little sister used to
pull my hair harder than that.

103
00:09:56,014 --> 00:09:57,223
Whatever.

104
00:10:01,394 --> 00:10:03,479
I gotta go.

105
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:16,949
- Where the fuck are you going?
- I'm tired.

106
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,660
You're tired?
It's America, you whiny bitch.

107
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:22,538
Why don't you fucking get in the cab
and do some honest work?

108
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:25,416
Yeah, she's on her way.
She can't wait to see you.

109
00:10:25,457 --> 00:10:28,710
Rambo the Skateboard Pimp
was my 10th kill.

110
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:34,549
- (muffled gunshot)
- Think of me as a street-sweeper.

111
00:10:34,591 --> 00:10:36,676
I cleaned up this worthless
piece of shit

112
00:10:36,718 --> 00:10:39,762
and left an obituary of sorts.
It rhymes.

113
00:10:48,645 --> 00:10:51,022
Rooster, we gotta find out
who did this.

114
00:10:51,064 --> 00:10:52,899
Give him a medal.

115
00:10:52,941 --> 00:10:55,777
Hey, Rambo, you see
who did this?

116
00:10:55,818 --> 00:10:57,779
He ain't talking, eh?

117
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,031
Real name Robert Brady.

118
00:11:00,072 --> 00:11:02,032
Bobby Brady. Damn shame.

119
00:11:02,074 --> 00:11:03,909
What are you thinking?
Marcia? Greg?

120
00:11:03,951 --> 00:11:05,411
(both chuckle)

121
00:11:05,452 --> 00:11:07,412
You guys messing up
my crime scene again?

122
00:11:07,454 --> 00:11:09,581
You don't know
who Bobby Brady is?

123
00:11:09,623 --> 00:11:11,625
Yeah, we met about an hour ago.

124
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:14,419
- It looks like close range.
- From the stippling around the wound

125
00:11:14,461 --> 00:11:16,087
I'd say two to three feet away.

126
00:11:16,129 --> 00:11:18,881
We'll be fishing fragments
out of his brains.

127
00:11:18,923 --> 00:11:20,967
- What?
- No, I just got that...

128
00:11:21,008 --> 00:11:23,093
"Marcia? Greg?"
That's a good one, Rooster.

129
00:11:23,135 --> 00:11:24,887
Well, that was quick.

130
00:11:24,928 --> 00:11:26,763
Just trying to keep pace with you.

131
00:11:30,934 --> 00:11:34,062
Turk: "He trades in sin,
distributes flesh.

132
00:11:34,104 --> 00:11:36,481
He picks the fruit
when it is fresh.

133
00:11:36,481 --> 00:11:39,609
Now someone else
must slap his whore.

134
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:44,405
His heart has stopped.
He breathes no more."

135
00:11:46,281 --> 00:11:48,283
What do you want to do
about this?

136
00:11:48,325 --> 00:11:51,119
I say let's make the best of it,

137
00:11:51,161 --> 00:11:54,289
canvass the hookers.
Maybe we'll meet one you like.

138
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:57,959
Please. I got all I can handle
from you-know-who.

139
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,835
No shit?

140
00:11:59,835 --> 00:12:02,963
She's got my sperm level so low
I gotta sit down to take a piss.

141
00:12:03,005 --> 00:12:04,632
Oh, thanks for that picture.

142
00:12:04,673 --> 00:12:06,967
- Hey, what can I tell you?
- (laughs)

143
00:12:07,009 --> 00:12:09,761
(Russian accent)
How can I help you, gentlemen?

144
00:12:09,803 --> 00:12:11,805
We'd like to talk to you
about your boss.

145
00:12:11,846 --> 00:12:14,140
He's upstairs.

146
00:12:14,182 --> 00:12:16,517
No, your other boss.

147
00:12:20,313 --> 00:12:22,314
Rambo.

148
00:12:22,356 --> 00:12:24,275
He is asshole.

149
00:12:24,316 --> 00:12:27,486
Why "he is asshole"?

150
00:12:27,528 --> 00:12:29,905
Follow me, please.

151
00:12:34,701 --> 00:12:36,327
You know anybody
who'd want to kill him?

152
00:12:36,369 --> 00:12:38,037
Me.

153
00:12:38,037 --> 00:12:39,372
Anyone else?

154
00:12:39,372 --> 00:12:41,374
Why? He's dead?

155
00:12:41,415 --> 00:12:43,083
(chuckles)

156
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,669
Hey, listen, you want to smarten up
and help us out

157
00:12:45,711 --> 00:12:47,379
or am I gonna have to call
somebody at ICE

158
00:12:47,421 --> 00:12:49,214
and have you on the next plane
to kielbasa-land?

159
00:12:49,256 --> 00:12:51,049
Go ahead.

160
00:12:51,091 --> 00:12:53,009
I am American citizen.

161
00:12:53,051 --> 00:12:55,094
Yeah.

162
00:12:55,136 --> 00:12:57,180
Lick my balls anytime.

163
00:12:57,263 --> 00:12:58,848
What?

164
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,850
Call us anytime, you know,

165
00:13:00,933 --> 00:13:03,310
if you hear something, anything.

166
00:13:05,688 --> 00:13:08,523
Rooster: I think we're looking
for a guy named Sam the Butcher.

167
00:13:08,565 --> 00:13:11,026
- Who?
- (laughs)

168
00:13:11,067 --> 00:13:13,319
Nah, he's kidding around.
But seriously, Lieutenant,

169
00:13:13,361 --> 00:13:15,405
how far do you want us to go
with this Rambo murder?

170
00:13:15,446 --> 00:13:17,907
I don't know, I was thinking maybe
you could investigate it a bit more,

171
00:13:17,949 --> 00:13:20,326
figure out who did it,
try to put him in jail.

172
00:13:20,368 --> 00:13:23,245
That is, if it doesn't get in the way
of your shuffleboard lessons.

173
00:13:23,287 --> 00:13:24,788
Yeah, no problem.

174
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:27,708
We're also working this dealer Spider
who's tied to these two stiffs

175
00:13:27,749 --> 00:13:29,042
we found on Fresh Kills.

176
00:13:32,337 --> 00:13:35,256
If we can nail him, who knows
how far up the ladder it will lead?

177
00:13:35,298 --> 00:13:36,424
So what about it?

178
00:13:36,466 --> 00:13:38,134
I popped this lawyer
with an ounce of blow.

179
00:13:38,176 --> 00:13:40,553
She practically shoved it up my nose.
I got her to flip on him.

180
00:13:40,594 --> 00:13:42,263
Lucky fuck, eh?

181
00:13:42,304 --> 00:13:43,931
She scored it from him directly?

182
00:13:43,973 --> 00:13:46,266
- Yeah, she did.
- Good.

183
00:13:46,308 --> 00:13:49,978
Okay, well, get what you can out of her
and kick her loose.

184
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,480
I hate trying to prosecute
fucking lawyers.

185
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,316
(trains passing)

186
00:14:01,197 --> 00:14:03,449
- This isn't Spider's club.
- The back way in.

187
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:07,494
Rooster: Yeah, it's an abandoned
linen factory, Jessica.

188
00:14:07,536 --> 00:14:10,497
I guess I'm not your average...

189
00:14:10,497 --> 00:14:11,998
what do you call it?

190
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,042
- Rat?
- Stoolie?

191
00:14:14,084 --> 00:14:16,085
Thanks.

192
00:14:16,127 --> 00:14:19,839
I mean, I think usually
it's some poor African-American kid

193
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,091
or a junkie or a prostitute.

194
00:14:22,133 --> 00:14:24,677
Well, normally 200-grand-a-year
corporate lawyers

195
00:14:24,718 --> 00:14:27,679
are much smarter than your average
African-American junkie whore...

196
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:30,348
normally, but sometimes
they only think they are.

197
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:33,226
Man over radio: It's all set
on this end.

198
00:14:33,268 --> 00:14:34,936
Are you guys sure
it's safe in there?

199
00:14:34,978 --> 00:14:38,022
Man: You tell your girlfriend
to grow a pair and let's go.

200
00:14:38,064 --> 00:14:41,150
What do you say, Counsel?
Are you ready to do this thing?

201
00:14:41,192 --> 00:14:43,861
Yeah, let's get it over with.

202
00:14:43,903 --> 00:14:46,864
Okay, remember what we said?
You go in there,

203
00:14:46,905 --> 00:14:50,283
you wait for him to ask you
for what you need, right?

204
00:14:50,325 --> 00:14:52,952
And then you don't come back here
with less than four ounces.

205
00:14:52,994 --> 00:14:54,454
- Four ounces?
- Yeah.

206
00:14:54,496 --> 00:14:57,165
Isn't that a lot? I, like, buy a couple
of balls at the club, that's it.

207
00:14:57,206 --> 00:15:00,167
You just say you're going skiing and
you need a week's worth of fresh powder.

208
00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:02,545
Yeah, you tell him you're going
on vacation.

209
00:15:05,422 --> 00:15:09,176
I do this thing
and my record's wiped clean?

210
00:15:09,217 --> 00:15:10,510
As a whistle.

211
00:15:10,552 --> 00:15:12,512
No one at my law firm will know
that I got busted, right?

212
00:15:12,554 --> 00:15:14,055
It never happened.

213
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:17,475
Look, Counsel, we all know you
better than this.

214
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:20,102
You just do this, you stop
shoving that shit up your nose,

215
00:15:20,144 --> 00:15:21,896
you go home, you get married,
you have kids,

216
00:15:21,937 --> 00:15:24,607
you never come back here,
and that's that.

217
00:15:26,108 --> 00:15:28,443
Yeah.

218
00:15:28,485 --> 00:15:31,321
Officer: Everybody's in position.

219
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:33,823
- Turk: Okay, we're going.
- Officer: Yes, sir.

220
00:15:36,117 --> 00:15:38,786
Officer: Let's push the signal
back 50%.

221
00:15:39,787 --> 00:15:41,831
Rooster: Hey, Jessica.

222
00:15:41,872 --> 00:15:43,332
Break a leg.

223
00:15:43,374 --> 00:15:46,043
(radio chatter)

224
00:15:46,085 --> 00:15:48,086
It's two flights down.

225
00:15:48,128 --> 00:15:50,464
The door's on the left.
Ring the bell.

226
00:15:55,969 --> 00:15:57,470
(rings doorbell)

227
00:15:57,512 --> 00:15:59,972
Hey, Stubby, why don't you
go and escort our company up here?

228
00:16:01,807 --> 00:16:03,809
Go on, fat boy.

229
00:16:07,688 --> 00:16:09,231
Get it on.

230
00:16:16,863 --> 00:16:19,532
- Good afternoon.
- Hey, Spider.

231
00:16:19,574 --> 00:16:22,076
- I'll be downstairs.
- All right.

232
00:16:22,118 --> 00:16:24,119
- How are you?
- All right, baby,

233
00:16:24,203 --> 00:16:26,538
just checking out this wizard shit
before I let my kids watch it.

234
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,041
- You seen this?
- No.

235
00:16:29,082 --> 00:16:31,543
The guy is a stone dealer.
I let my little ones watch this...

236
00:16:31,585 --> 00:16:33,837
they'll all turn out junkies.
You know what I'm saying?

237
00:16:33,878 --> 00:16:35,380
He's got a point.

238
00:16:35,421 --> 00:16:37,632
- You remember Underdog?
- What about him?

239
00:16:37,673 --> 00:16:40,593
That fucking dog spawned
a generation of junkies.

240
00:16:40,635 --> 00:16:44,471
So you converted the bank
into a club and a recording studio?

241
00:16:44,513 --> 00:16:47,057
- Yeah. You like it?
- Yeah.

242
00:16:47,099 --> 00:16:49,017
What are you talking about?

243
00:16:49,059 --> 00:16:50,769
What did Underdog do
all the time?

244
00:16:50,811 --> 00:16:52,520
He was always shining shoes

245
00:16:52,562 --> 00:16:54,689
and whenever Sweet Polly Purebred
would call out to him,

246
00:16:54,731 --> 00:16:56,733
his dog ears would pick it up
and he'd rescue her.

247
00:16:56,733 --> 00:16:59,235
Yeah, but what did he do
when he needed his super strength?

248
00:16:59,235 --> 00:17:01,404
He'd go to his ring, remember?

249
00:17:01,445 --> 00:17:03,322
Pull out a pill, pop it.

250
00:17:03,364 --> 00:17:06,867
Holy shit, you're right.
He was a little fucking speed freak.

251
00:17:06,909 --> 00:17:08,243
Spider: So what's the business?

252
00:17:08,243 --> 00:17:11,079
How about a QP?
You're good for a QP.

253
00:17:11,121 --> 00:17:12,789
The fuck you want with QP?

254
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:15,458
I'm going skiing with friends,

255
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,044
a lot of friends.

256
00:17:18,086 --> 00:17:20,546
- Where?
- Aspen, Colorado.

257
00:17:20,588 --> 00:17:23,299
Shit. I'm sure you can
score one in Aspen.

258
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,342
Not your primo brand.

259
00:17:26,343 --> 00:17:27,761
You ski?

260
00:17:27,803 --> 00:17:29,304
Sure. My whole life.

261
00:17:29,346 --> 00:17:32,474
Come on, I don't have all day.

262
00:17:32,515 --> 00:17:34,851
Why don't you put down your jacket,
stay a little while?

263
00:17:34,893 --> 00:17:36,060
What do you think?

264
00:17:36,102 --> 00:17:37,687
Jessica: Actually,
I've got to run.

265
00:17:37,729 --> 00:17:41,607
I have a major IPO
closing in an hour, so...

266
00:17:41,649 --> 00:17:44,401
You know, stress will kill you.
You gotta chill out.

267
00:17:45,778 --> 00:17:47,696
I'm as chill as I get.

268
00:17:47,738 --> 00:17:49,740
What do you want to do?

269
00:17:53,076 --> 00:17:55,453
You know, every once in a while...

270
00:17:57,663 --> 00:17:59,707
one of you Upper East Side bitches
gets popped,

271
00:17:59,749 --> 00:18:01,751
tries to to roll over
on a nigga like me.

272
00:18:01,792 --> 00:18:03,878
You're scared now.

273
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,089
(doorbell ringing)

274
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:11,134
Looks like the cavalry
come to rescue you.

275
00:18:11,176 --> 00:18:12,677
Can I help you, gentlemen?

276
00:18:12,719 --> 00:18:14,179
Yeah, let us in, Spider.

277
00:18:14,179 --> 00:18:16,389
I'm sorry, there's no one here
by that name.

278
00:18:16,431 --> 00:18:19,350
- Let us in.
- We only want to talk to you.

279
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,977
(door buzzes)

280
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:24,938
See, I know how to look
and I know where to look.

281
00:18:30,861 --> 00:18:32,862
Come to papa.

282
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:36,199
It always hurts the first time.

283
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:38,826
Turk: You all right?

284
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:40,661
Why wouldn't she be all right?
We're watching TV.

285
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:42,371
How the fuck is she gonna get hurt
watching TV?

286
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:44,999
She could have seen or heard
something that scared her.

287
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,959
- Like what?
- Like some big fucking mutt

288
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,502
shooting his bug fat
fucking mouth off.

289
00:18:48,543 --> 00:18:51,421
Wasn't nobody here fitting that description
till a minute ago.

290
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,381
I'm gonna show you ugly,
you fucking mother...

291
00:18:53,381 --> 00:18:55,884
- We've said enough.
- Oh, you finna bring your wife up in here?

292
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:58,970
That's it. That's it.
Let's go. It's okay.

293
00:18:59,011 --> 00:19:01,722
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.

294
00:19:01,764 --> 00:19:03,724
You want your wire back?

295
00:19:05,351 --> 00:19:07,227
Firearm!

296
00:19:07,227 --> 00:19:08,353
No, Stubby, no!

297
00:19:17,111 --> 00:19:18,946
Get down.
Get the fuck down!

298
00:19:28,747 --> 00:19:30,207
Turk: Come on.

299
00:19:30,248 --> 00:19:33,043
The fat one's dead.

300
00:19:34,461 --> 00:19:37,255
(Jessica moaning)

301
00:19:42,134 --> 00:19:43,552
Well, that went well.

302
00:19:45,429 --> 00:19:47,306
Oh, shit, you're bleeding.

303
00:19:48,307 --> 00:19:51,434
3-4 squad, Central.
11-41, request ambulance.

304
00:19:51,476 --> 00:19:54,270
I need EMS. Subject shot,
184th and St. Nicholas.

305
00:19:54,312 --> 00:19:56,481
Really, I tried my best.

306
00:19:56,522 --> 00:19:59,817
You're doing just fine, Counsel.
You're doing just fine. Just relax.

307
00:19:59,859 --> 00:20:02,945
Hey, guys, if you ever
need a lawyer...

308
00:20:02,987 --> 00:20:05,739
Yeah, okay.

309
00:20:05,781 --> 00:20:08,241
You bet.

310
00:20:10,994 --> 00:20:13,204
In good old days
we used to

311
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:15,957
let the perp bleed out
and call off the ambulance.

312
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,959
- Calm calm calm.
- Fucking lowlife.

313
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,794
You made your point.
You made your point.

314
00:20:19,835 --> 00:20:22,129
Tough little bitch, ain't you,
kicking a man while he's handcuffed?

315
00:20:22,171 --> 00:20:24,632
Shut the fuck up,
you piece of shit.

316
00:20:24,673 --> 00:20:26,300
You think I won't blow
your fucking head off?

317
00:20:26,341 --> 00:20:28,135
I wouldn't think twice
about it.

318
00:20:28,176 --> 00:20:30,429
I'd go in there,
get the fat boy's gun,

319
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:34,140
come back here
and put two between your eyes.

320
00:20:34,182 --> 00:20:36,100
(rapid footsteps)

321
00:20:38,936 --> 00:20:40,938
Where's EMS?

322
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:44,149
Woman: This thing was a clusterfuck
to end all clusterfucks.

323
00:20:44,191 --> 00:20:45,776
You got nothing.

324
00:20:45,818 --> 00:20:47,778
How about felony murder?

325
00:20:47,819 --> 00:20:50,322
No drugs, right?
So no predicate felony,

326
00:20:50,363 --> 00:20:52,240
no conspiracy,
no nothing.

327
00:20:52,282 --> 00:20:54,325
No felony. No felony.
I can't believe this.

328
00:20:54,367 --> 00:20:56,077
No felony.
How do you spell felony?

329
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:59,455
Homicide, racketeering, drugs...
I mean, what are we talking about?

330
00:20:59,497 --> 00:21:02,124
Hey, you're lucky
that white girl didn't die.

331
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,043
IAB is gonna interview
both of you

332
00:21:04,084 --> 00:21:06,545
and do a preliminary report
over the next couple of weeks.

333
00:21:06,587 --> 00:21:10,090
Now off the record
you actually didn't violate procedure

334
00:21:10,132 --> 00:21:12,550
because the victim had a firearm
aimed at you,

335
00:21:12,592 --> 00:21:14,844
so if you stick together
you should make it through this.

336
00:21:14,886 --> 00:21:16,846
Lieutenant: You'd better get
your story straight too,

337
00:21:16,929 --> 00:21:19,724
'cause I'm not going back to Far Rockaway
because you two fucked up.

338
00:21:19,765 --> 00:21:22,393
And you're gonna spend some couch time
with the rubber-gun squad.

339
00:21:22,435 --> 00:21:26,230
And you'd better take this shrink seriously
or you'll be off active duty.

340
00:21:26,271 --> 00:21:28,023
That fucking piece of shit
just walks.

341
00:21:28,065 --> 00:21:29,858
Knock it off, Turk.

342
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,988
Relax, partner.
He's gonna get his.

343
00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:37,532
Man: Gentlemen, your questions.

344
00:21:37,615 --> 00:21:39,992
- Who made the decision to enter?
- I did.

345
00:21:40,034 --> 00:21:42,036
- Whose decision was it to enter?
- Mine.

346
00:21:42,078 --> 00:21:44,371
Did you immediately identify yourselves
as police officers?

347
00:21:44,413 --> 00:21:46,707
- Yes, we did.
- Did you immediately identify yourselves?

348
00:21:46,748 --> 00:21:49,251
The informant's position
was becoming untenable.

349
00:21:49,292 --> 00:21:51,545
- We were afraid she was in danger.
- Turns out you were right.

350
00:21:51,586 --> 00:21:54,089
- No fucking kidding, nine-to-fiver.
- Excuse me, detective?

351
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:56,507
Are you finished
with my client?

352
00:21:58,468 --> 00:22:02,430
- They're like Lennon and McCartney.
- Not an inch of daylight between them.

353
00:22:02,471 --> 00:22:03,722
What do you think?

354
00:22:03,764 --> 00:22:05,057
Nothing there.

355
00:22:05,099 --> 00:22:07,976
They endangered the informant.
We can't make them wrong on that.

356
00:22:07,976 --> 00:22:09,603
They saw a gun, they reacted.

357
00:22:09,644 --> 00:22:11,438
They beat the fuck
out of the suspect,

358
00:22:11,479 --> 00:22:13,565
but he's not filing charges.

359
00:22:13,606 --> 00:22:15,650
Let's see what the shrink says.

360
00:22:16,651 --> 00:22:19,070
So what are we gonna
do now, doc?

361
00:22:19,111 --> 00:22:21,280
Are we gonna find out
if I'm sane enough

362
00:22:21,322 --> 00:22:24,074
to carry a gun,
chase bad guys?

363
00:22:24,116 --> 00:22:26,702
Okay, why did you become a cop?

364
00:22:26,743 --> 00:22:29,496
Well, it was New Year's Eve.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

365
00:22:29,496 --> 00:22:33,416
I didn't have the same opportunities
you had, dr. Prosky.

366
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:36,169
Where I come from
it was either a gun and a badge

367
00:22:36,169 --> 00:22:38,045
or a hard hat and a hammer.

368
00:22:38,087 --> 00:22:40,548
How do you feel
when you fire your weapon?

369
00:22:40,589 --> 00:22:43,342
It's like dirty Harry said...
"There's nothing wrong

370
00:22:43,342 --> 00:22:45,969
with a little shooting as long as
the right people get shot."

371
00:22:46,053 --> 00:22:47,971
Prosky: And when the wrong people
get shot?

372
00:22:48,013 --> 00:22:50,974
Turk: It sucks, but I'd rather be in it
that out of it.

373
00:22:51,016 --> 00:22:53,101
There's nothing worse
than being stuck on a bench.

374
00:22:53,143 --> 00:22:55,353
How do you feel when you see
innocent people get killed?

375
00:22:55,395 --> 00:22:57,647
You know...

376
00:22:59,398 --> 00:23:02,610
I sort of get numb to it.

377
00:23:02,651 --> 00:23:05,320
Here.

378
00:23:05,362 --> 00:23:06,822
I want you to take this.

379
00:23:06,905 --> 00:23:10,242
Use it to jot down your thoughts,
your questions,

380
00:23:10,283 --> 00:23:12,786
anything you may have noticed
about yourself,

381
00:23:12,827 --> 00:23:14,287
whatever.

382
00:23:14,329 --> 00:23:16,164
I won't ask for it.

383
00:23:16,205 --> 00:23:18,958
Just for you.

384
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,501
I want you to try it.

385
00:23:20,543 --> 00:23:22,545
Sounds like fun.

386
00:23:24,421 --> 00:23:28,008
(Karen panting)
Harder.

387
00:23:34,848 --> 00:23:37,141
(crowd cheering)

388
00:23:42,688 --> 00:23:44,023
Go, Turk, go!

389
00:23:45,399 --> 00:23:48,443
You got third.
Go go!

390
00:23:48,485 --> 00:23:51,196
Yeah!
Look at that.

391
00:23:51,238 --> 00:23:53,615
You own it. You own it.

392
00:23:53,615 --> 00:23:55,491
No matter what they say
about you,

393
00:23:55,533 --> 00:23:57,618
you're tremendous!

394
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:02,039
Go go, Turk, go!

395
00:24:03,874 --> 00:24:05,959
Safe.
You dropped the ball.

396
00:24:06,001 --> 00:24:08,337
- A fucking cheap shot, man.
- Get away from the bag.

397
00:24:08,378 --> 00:24:11,298
- Or what? Or what? Or what?
- Watch the bag.

398
00:24:11,339 --> 00:24:15,009
(all yelling)

399
00:24:22,975 --> 00:24:25,394
Turk's voice: The NYPd is bubbling
with frustration,

400
00:24:25,436 --> 00:24:27,020
hostility and testosterone,

401
00:24:27,062 --> 00:24:29,064
ready to erupt
at any moment.

402
00:24:29,106 --> 00:24:31,107
Think of me
as the release valve.

403
00:24:31,149 --> 00:24:33,985
One flick of the trigger
and the pressure goes down.

404
00:24:34,027 --> 00:24:36,112
You know why
you join the force?

405
00:24:36,195 --> 00:24:38,281
To get respect.

406
00:24:38,322 --> 00:24:40,032
Most people respect the badge.

407
00:24:40,074 --> 00:24:42,409
Everybody respects the gun.

408
00:24:47,873 --> 00:24:49,833
Hey, Riley, I was talking to Jd...

409
00:24:49,875 --> 00:24:52,961
you guys caught a stiff named
Phillip Trager, a gun-runner?

410
00:24:53,003 --> 00:24:55,213
Oh, yeah, a real piece of shit.

411
00:24:55,255 --> 00:24:57,215
- How did that go down?
- I don't know.

412
00:24:57,215 --> 00:24:59,508
Somebody gave him a taste
of his own medicine, I guess,

413
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:01,927
walked right into his apartment,
killed him with one of his own guns.

414
00:25:01,969 --> 00:25:04,221
Did the shooter leave a note
or anything?

415
00:25:04,263 --> 00:25:07,224
Yeah, actually,
the shooter left a poem.

416
00:25:10,352 --> 00:25:12,854
He did?
No shit.

417
00:25:12,896 --> 00:25:14,898
Yeah. Hey, Simon,

418
00:25:14,939 --> 00:25:18,401
you remember that poem
from the Trager case?

419
00:25:20,403 --> 00:25:22,446
What are you doing, man?

420
00:25:22,488 --> 00:25:24,490
Turk's asking about it.

421
00:25:24,531 --> 00:25:26,992
What the hell are you doing?

422
00:25:27,034 --> 00:25:29,453
? Que mierda 'tas haciendo ahi, papa?

423
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:31,413
No le digas mierda a eso loco.

424
00:25:31,454 --> 00:25:35,083
Riley: Calmate. He wants to hear
about the poem.

425
00:25:35,124 --> 00:25:37,377
"Merchant of thieving class,

426
00:25:37,418 --> 00:25:40,546
I slit his throat
and capped his ass.

427
00:25:40,588 --> 00:25:42,047
I took his gun, I took his...

428
00:25:42,089 --> 00:25:45,050
I took his life, I took his gun,
But too bad he's not the only one."

429
00:25:45,092 --> 00:25:47,177
That's how it goes,
something like that.

430
00:25:47,219 --> 00:25:49,513
It's not iambic pentameter,
but it rhymes.

431
00:25:49,554 --> 00:25:51,556
- Rooster.
- Yo.

432
00:25:52,557 --> 00:25:54,434
We're looking for the same guy.

433
00:25:54,476 --> 00:25:57,645
He knocked off a pimp named Rambo
a few weeks ago. When was yours?

434
00:25:57,687 --> 00:26:00,231
Last week. We're running ours with the ATF
because of the guns.

435
00:26:00,273 --> 00:26:03,317
We're back in business on the Rambo case.
Looks like the same guy knocked off

436
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:05,778
- a gun dealer on the three-three last week.
- No shit.

437
00:26:05,819 --> 00:26:08,780
- What do you mean? That's our case.
- That's our case. You're taking our case.

438
00:26:08,822 --> 00:26:11,283
Seniority, guys.
Tag along, you'll learn something.

439
00:26:11,324 --> 00:26:13,493
Oh, tell me the guy's name
is Greg Brady.

440
00:26:13,535 --> 00:26:15,495
Please. It is, isn't it?

441
00:26:15,537 --> 00:26:18,081
Oh, somebody's knocking off
the Brady Bunch.

442
00:26:18,122 --> 00:26:22,001
Gotta be the Partridge Family.
(laughs)

443
00:26:22,042 --> 00:26:25,087
Turk's voice: Trager,
a gun-runner bites the dust...

444
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:27,214
number 11.

445
00:26:35,597 --> 00:26:39,392
Karen: The bullet matched the.45
in Trager's apartment.

446
00:26:39,433 --> 00:26:41,894
That was no surprise.
So I ran it through ATF.

447
00:26:41,936 --> 00:26:44,980
It's one of a batch of six
that was stolen from a gun shop

448
00:26:45,022 --> 00:26:47,316
- in Virginia last month.
- Yeah, probably by Trager.

449
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:50,026
That's what they think.
He matches the description they have.

450
00:26:50,068 --> 00:26:52,779
It still doesn't help us find the guy.
It just helps us tie him to the victims,

451
00:26:52,821 --> 00:26:55,281
which he's already doing
with his little fucking poems.

452
00:26:55,365 --> 00:26:58,409
- (phone ringing)
- Excuse me. Hello.

453
00:26:58,451 --> 00:27:01,662
Hey, Turk, don't forget
we got a court date later.

454
00:27:01,704 --> 00:27:04,873
So...

455
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:08,543
I heard he kicked the shit
out of that dealer you guys took down.

456
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,420
Spider.

457
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:11,630
So?

458
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,800
Did he?

459
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:21,263
Yeah, he got him
down on the ground.

460
00:27:21,305 --> 00:27:23,724
The guy was handcuffed.

461
00:27:24,725 --> 00:27:27,811
And he just started
kicking him in the gut.

462
00:27:27,853 --> 00:27:30,230
And then

463
00:27:30,272 --> 00:27:32,607
he gets down on the guy's chest

464
00:27:32,649 --> 00:27:35,985
and he really starts smacking him

465
00:27:36,027 --> 00:27:38,946
hard in the face over and over

466
00:27:38,988 --> 00:27:40,990
and screaming at the top
of his lungs,

467
00:27:41,032 --> 00:27:43,284
"I'm gonna break
your fucking face,

468
00:27:43,325 --> 00:27:45,744
you little bitch!"

469
00:27:45,744 --> 00:27:48,080
Then his eyes really started
to fill up.

470
00:27:48,121 --> 00:27:50,123
I mean, they get dark...

471
00:27:50,165 --> 00:27:52,334
you know how he gets
the sort of rage in him.

472
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:56,129
I thought he was gonna
kill this guy.

473
00:27:57,505 --> 00:27:59,966
Really?

474
00:28:02,676 --> 00:28:05,095
You're a bad little girl.

475
00:28:05,137 --> 00:28:06,972
Hmm?

476
00:28:07,014 --> 00:28:10,058
- I got work to do.
- You bet.

477
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:15,438
Woman: Counselor,
my hands are tied here.

478
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,482
Without a secure
chain of custody,

479
00:28:17,523 --> 00:28:20,276
any evidence obtained
after the initial search

480
00:28:20,318 --> 00:28:22,778
- must be excluded.
- You gotta be fucking kidding me.

481
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,155
Therefore I am forced
to grant defense

482
00:28:25,197 --> 00:28:27,491
motion to dismiss
all charges

483
00:28:27,533 --> 00:28:29,743
of rape and assault
against Mr. Van Luytens.

484
00:28:29,785 --> 00:28:31,786
- Your Honor.
- Judge: You think I want this guy

485
00:28:31,828 --> 00:28:33,955
going anywhere
near my daughter,

486
00:28:33,997 --> 00:28:36,165
or anyone's daughter
for that matter?

487
00:28:36,207 --> 00:28:38,668
You messed up.
I am unleashing your client

488
00:28:38,709 --> 00:28:40,961
unto the world.
I'm sure we'll all be

489
00:28:41,003 --> 00:28:42,463
back here again very soon.

490
00:28:42,505 --> 00:28:45,466
Look at him.
Look at this motherfucker.

491
00:28:45,507 --> 00:28:49,136
Hey, it's gonna come back to you, mutt.
You're gonna get it.

492
00:28:49,177 --> 00:28:51,596
- When you walk outside watch your back.
- Easy, Turk.

493
00:28:51,638 --> 00:28:52,806
Order in my court.

494
00:28:52,847 --> 00:28:56,100
- Okay, mutt? You fucking mutt.
- Not here, not now.

495
00:28:56,142 --> 00:28:58,561
Not here, not now.
Will you get him out of here

496
00:28:58,603 --> 00:29:01,147
before somebody passes a sentence
on him you can't appeal?

497
00:29:01,188 --> 00:29:02,439
Order!

498
00:29:02,481 --> 00:29:05,609
- You know what I mean? Go go.
- Order, detective.

499
00:29:05,651 --> 00:29:09,613
Turk's voice: Dr. Prosky suggested
that I free-associate.

500
00:29:09,654 --> 00:29:12,032
So here I go.

501
00:29:12,073 --> 00:29:14,701
You know what I think about
when I pull a trigger?

502
00:29:14,742 --> 00:29:17,703
- I think about the Infield Fly Rule.
- (doorbell buzzes)

503
00:29:17,703 --> 00:29:20,748
I love that fucking rule.
It assumes the worst in everybody.

504
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:24,501
It says, "Sorry, batter, you're a schmuck
for popping up with runners on.

505
00:29:24,543 --> 00:29:26,920
And you, stupid-ass infielder,
you don't get to cheat

506
00:29:26,962 --> 00:29:29,381
and drop the ball just because
you caught a break."

507
00:29:29,423 --> 00:29:31,091
My favorite part...
the batter's out

508
00:29:31,132 --> 00:29:33,301
but the runners advance
at their own risk.

509
00:29:33,343 --> 00:29:35,595
Well, isn't this
a pleasant surprise?

510
00:29:35,637 --> 00:29:37,722
Turk's voice: That's the way
life should be.

511
00:29:37,764 --> 00:29:39,765
You can be a motherfucker
at your own risk.

512
00:29:39,807 --> 00:29:43,060
(muffled gunshots)

513
00:29:43,102 --> 00:29:46,897
Or not.
Van Luytens... one less rapist.

514
00:29:46,939 --> 00:29:49,191
Who's gonna miss him?
Nobody.

515
00:29:49,232 --> 00:29:51,401
Number 12 and counting.

516
00:30:05,622 --> 00:30:07,541
Whoa whoa, hot coffee.

517
00:30:07,583 --> 00:30:09,251
- Good morning, detective Riley.
- Hey, good morning.

518
00:30:09,292 --> 00:30:11,294
- Door on your left.
- Any signs of forced entry?

519
00:30:11,294 --> 00:30:13,004
Doesn't look like it.
Detective Perez is in there.

520
00:30:13,046 --> 00:30:14,464
He's in there already?
All right.

521
00:30:14,464 --> 00:30:16,591
- Hey, how about those Mets last night?
- Yeah, how about 'em?

522
00:30:16,633 --> 00:30:18,718
Hey, Teddy, Teddy, come here,
check this out.

523
00:30:20,136 --> 00:30:22,471
Wow.

524
00:30:22,513 --> 00:30:23,764
Fuck.

525
00:30:23,806 --> 00:30:26,600
- Oh my God.
- That's big.

526
00:30:26,642 --> 00:30:28,602
And powerful.

527
00:30:28,644 --> 00:30:31,521
- What, a plasma screen?
- LCd.

528
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:33,606
- That's plasma.
- No, it's got to be LCd.

529
00:30:33,648 --> 00:30:35,984
- Perez: It wouldn't be that big.
- Hey, guys, guys.

530
00:30:35,984 --> 00:30:39,445
He was shot at close range,
dropped right here.

531
00:30:39,487 --> 00:30:42,239
The pussy doesn't look like he put up
much of a fight, does he, Karen?

532
00:30:42,281 --> 00:30:44,325
Nothing to indicate that

533
00:30:44,366 --> 00:30:47,911
in terms of struggle.
No forced entry, cuts, bruises.

534
00:30:47,953 --> 00:30:51,164
Hey, nobody wants to hear
about your private life, Officer Corelli.

535
00:30:51,206 --> 00:30:54,459
That's detective to you,
Officer Needledick.

536
00:30:54,501 --> 00:30:56,419
- Ooh.
- Perez: Ouch.

537
00:30:56,461 --> 00:30:58,796
- Looks like it's our guy again.
- Who did you get this time?

538
00:30:58,838 --> 00:31:00,464
This is Jonathan Van Luytens.

539
00:31:00,506 --> 00:31:02,466
He owns a couple
of car dealerships.

540
00:31:02,508 --> 00:31:04,843
- Oh, shit.
- He was up on rape charges,

541
00:31:04,843 --> 00:31:07,054
but they got tossed out
last week.

542
00:31:07,095 --> 00:31:09,097
Look at this.

543
00:31:09,139 --> 00:31:13,226
"A man devoid of all respect,
Of beauty, charm or intellect,

544
00:31:13,268 --> 00:31:15,687
He took what women
would not give.

545
00:31:15,728 --> 00:31:17,688
He didn't have
the right to live."

546
00:31:17,688 --> 00:31:20,066
That's our boy all right.

547
00:31:20,107 --> 00:31:23,277
Looks like he had a beef
with our old pal Jonny.

548
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:24,403
You know him?

549
00:31:24,445 --> 00:31:26,321
Both: Yeah.

550
00:31:26,363 --> 00:31:28,657
He's one slippery
son of a bitch, let me tell you.

551
00:31:28,699 --> 00:31:31,409
Turk: Yeah.

552
00:31:31,409 --> 00:31:34,537
Lieutenant: You guys know how much
fun it is to not catch a serial killer?

553
00:31:34,579 --> 00:31:36,289
You got a point here, Lieutenant?

554
00:31:36,331 --> 00:31:38,082
The point is

555
00:31:38,124 --> 00:31:40,251
you'd better both
think seriously

556
00:31:40,293 --> 00:31:42,378
about whether or not
you want the lead on this case.

557
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:44,088
You don't think
we're up to this?

558
00:31:45,089 --> 00:31:48,300
Come on, you got what,

559
00:31:48,342 --> 00:31:51,052
about 110 years on the job
between the two of you?

560
00:31:51,094 --> 00:31:54,139
- 120.
- (laughs)

561
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:56,432
I'm telling you, you screw it up
badly enough,

562
00:31:56,474 --> 00:31:58,684
they may try to fuck you
out of your pension.

563
00:31:58,726 --> 00:31:59,936
You want to risk that?

564
00:31:59,977 --> 00:32:01,812
- Yeah.
- Fuck, yeah.

565
00:32:01,854 --> 00:32:06,817
406, Lieutenant. 406.

566
00:32:06,859 --> 00:32:09,444
Okay, 406...
what does that mean?

567
00:32:09,486 --> 00:32:11,029
Ted Williams.

568
00:32:11,071 --> 00:32:14,115
Ted Williams, the last day of the season,
is batting 400.

569
00:32:14,157 --> 00:32:17,243
Sox manager wants to bench him,
protect his average, right?

570
00:32:17,285 --> 00:32:19,120
Williams plays
both games anyway,

571
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,122
goes six for eight,
ends up at 406...

572
00:32:21,122 --> 00:32:22,832
the last guy that ever hit
over 400.

573
00:32:22,873 --> 00:32:25,376
Okay, fine. It's all yours.

574
00:32:25,417 --> 00:32:28,420
Just don't go moaning to me
when some traffic cop

575
00:32:28,462 --> 00:32:30,797
pulls your serial killer over
for speeding

576
00:32:30,797 --> 00:32:33,425
and he grabs your
15 minutes of fame and you realize

577
00:32:33,466 --> 00:32:36,636
the asshole could have been
standing right there in front of you

578
00:32:36,678 --> 00:32:39,764
and it would have taken you
1000 light years to nail him.

579
00:32:39,805 --> 00:32:41,515
Not for nothing, Lieutenant,

580
00:32:41,557 --> 00:32:44,601
light years measures distance,
not time.

581
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:49,481
Well, thank you, detective.
I'll make a note of that.

582
00:32:49,523 --> 00:32:52,359
Ellis Lynde, 2003.

583
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,153
This guy had a history
of cruising gay bars,

584
00:32:55,195 --> 00:32:57,989
picking up twinkies,
beating the shit out of them.

585
00:32:58,030 --> 00:33:00,950
Lynde was found shot dead
in his apartment.

586
00:33:00,991 --> 00:33:03,869
Whoever's doing this
gets up real close to the guys,

587
00:33:03,911 --> 00:33:06,580
blows their brains out
without any trouble,

588
00:33:06,622 --> 00:33:08,123
leaves no fingerprints

589
00:33:08,165 --> 00:33:09,958
and obviously
takes pride in his work.

590
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,295
Okay, what could be
murder number two back from '04,

591
00:33:14,337 --> 00:33:15,755
one Matthew Mitrella.

592
00:33:15,797 --> 00:33:17,715
(trails off)

593
00:33:20,718 --> 00:33:22,845
Turk's voice: I was shaking
the first couple of times

594
00:33:22,887 --> 00:33:25,723
I killed in cold blood.

595
00:33:25,764 --> 00:33:29,101
I kept thinking if I got caught
they'd kick me off the force.

596
00:33:29,142 --> 00:33:31,770
I wasn't worried about prison,
but losing the gun and the shield...

597
00:33:31,811 --> 00:33:33,021
that scared me.

598
00:33:33,063 --> 00:33:35,565
I went into work the next day
expecting to feel different.

599
00:33:35,607 --> 00:33:38,693
I thought everybody would look at me
the way cops look at civilians

600
00:33:38,734 --> 00:33:40,986
and know which ones are dirty.

601
00:33:47,951 --> 00:33:50,287
But they didn't.
That's when I knew

602
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:52,914
I could keep on
doing this forever.

603
00:33:56,084 --> 00:34:00,004
Turk's voice: So next stop... Spider.

604
00:34:00,046 --> 00:34:02,047
If we shut down his business,

605
00:34:02,089 --> 00:34:04,049
maybe he'd be a rat.

606
00:34:04,091 --> 00:34:06,093
We got a lawyer.

607
00:34:06,135 --> 00:34:09,930
We needed her to testify
that she bought coke from him.

608
00:34:09,930 --> 00:34:12,515
She was a good lawyer.

609
00:34:12,557 --> 00:34:17,020
Me and my partner paid a visit
to Club 404 of Harlem.

610
00:34:17,061 --> 00:34:18,187
A word about him...

611
00:34:18,229 --> 00:34:21,315
Tom Cowen's been my partner
for almost 30 years.

612
00:34:21,357 --> 00:34:23,275
He's the best cop
I've ever seen.

613
00:34:25,194 --> 00:34:28,739
I'm always the one
following him through the door.

614
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,907
There's a bullet
that was meant for me

615
00:34:30,949 --> 00:34:34,536
that's lodged in his torso.

616
00:34:34,577 --> 00:34:36,621
He was my role model.

617
00:34:36,663 --> 00:34:39,040
The day I stopped
trying to be Tom Cowen

618
00:34:39,081 --> 00:34:41,542
was the greatest day
of my life.

619
00:34:55,388 --> 00:34:58,391
Hey, Rooster,

620
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:01,435
I was going through the files
on poetry boy.

621
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:03,729
That's an interesting way
to pass your time.

622
00:35:03,771 --> 00:35:06,190
Okay, there was a gun

623
00:35:06,231 --> 00:35:08,400
found on Charles Randall
when he was arrested.

624
00:35:08,442 --> 00:35:09,651
Yeah.

625
00:35:09,693 --> 00:35:12,862
Now in all the other shootings
the gun was left at the scene,

626
00:35:12,904 --> 00:35:16,074
but there are a lot of similarities.
So I mentioned it to Perez and Riley.

627
00:35:16,115 --> 00:35:18,159
I think somebody should go
interview him in prison.

628
00:35:18,201 --> 00:35:20,828
I think there may be a connection.

629
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:24,331
That's a good idea,
but not Perez and Riley.

630
00:35:24,373 --> 00:35:26,834
I mean, not those guys.
They'll screw it up.

631
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:29,002
This is too important.

632
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:31,504
Turk and I will handle Randall, okay?

633
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,089
Good work.

634
00:35:56,569 --> 00:35:58,571
(door buzzes)

635
00:36:04,535 --> 00:36:06,912
Detectives, Charles Randall.

636
00:36:08,747 --> 00:36:11,875
What the fuck
do you two scumbags want?

637
00:36:11,917 --> 00:36:14,586
What a greeting.

638
00:36:14,627 --> 00:36:17,713
You like poetry, Chuck?

639
00:36:17,755 --> 00:36:18,798
What?

640
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:22,051
Do you like poetry?

641
00:36:23,093 --> 00:36:26,763
Yeah.
Roses are red, violets are blue,

642
00:36:26,805 --> 00:36:29,766
I want to poke out your fucking eyes
with my dick, you fuck.

643
00:36:29,808 --> 00:36:31,768
How's that?

644
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:34,437
I thought you'd rhyme.
You didn't.

645
00:36:34,479 --> 00:36:36,648
Fuck you.
Fuck both of you.

646
00:36:36,689 --> 00:36:38,316
Get me out of here.

647
00:36:38,357 --> 00:36:41,277
(door buzzes)

648
00:36:41,318 --> 00:36:44,780
(siren wailing)

649
00:36:44,822 --> 00:36:48,283
(blues playing)

650
00:36:48,325 --> 00:36:50,619
Why the fuck did we even bother
going out there?

651
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:52,746
What would it look like
if we didn't go?

652
00:36:54,497 --> 00:36:56,666
Are you gonna relax?

653
00:36:56,708 --> 00:36:58,709
Relax.

654
00:36:58,751 --> 00:37:00,670
Yeah, I'll just take it out
on Karen later.

655
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:02,963
The more I'm with her,
the more abuse she wants.

656
00:37:03,005 --> 00:37:04,298
Sounds like fun.

657
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,924
Hey, you want to take her
off my hands?

658
00:37:05,966 --> 00:37:10,428
Be careful, partner, because I have
a very special effect on women.

659
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:11,638
Go wild.

660
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,098
Whatever.

661
00:37:13,139 --> 00:37:16,142
I can't believe I had to face
that piece of shit and look like an idiot.

662
00:37:16,184 --> 00:37:19,478
Eh, fuck him.
He's where he belongs.

663
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,147
I'm sorry, partner,
I'm really sorry.

664
00:37:21,188 --> 00:37:24,108
Stop worrying about it.

665
00:37:25,943 --> 00:37:29,654
Whatever happens,
I'm not taking you down with me.

666
00:37:29,696 --> 00:37:32,657
Don't worry about me.
I'm all right, believe me.

667
00:37:32,699 --> 00:37:35,952
I don't know what I was thinking.
I just don't know what I was thinking.

668
00:37:35,994 --> 00:37:38,329
You know what you was thinking?
You were thinking

669
00:37:38,371 --> 00:37:40,998
about a 10-year-old girl
who had her skull crushed.

670
00:37:42,041 --> 00:37:44,501
Yeah, I tried to stop you,
but you know what?

671
00:37:44,543 --> 00:37:48,797
I admired you that day,
what you did.

672
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:51,800
That was righteous.

673
00:37:51,841 --> 00:37:55,678
And you don't second-guess yourself
on something like that.

674
00:38:02,685 --> 00:38:04,687
Okay, I'm the killer.

675
00:38:04,728 --> 00:38:07,231
I'm the killer.
I show up at your door

676
00:38:07,272 --> 00:38:09,274
or your car window,

677
00:38:09,316 --> 00:38:11,610
and for some reason
you open your door,

678
00:38:11,651 --> 00:38:14,571
you roll down
your car window for me.

679
00:38:14,612 --> 00:38:16,823
So who am I?

680
00:38:16,864 --> 00:38:19,242
Someone I know.

681
00:38:19,283 --> 00:38:20,743
Maybe a nice set of tits.

682
00:38:20,785 --> 00:38:22,912
And the poems?
What about the poems?

683
00:38:22,953 --> 00:38:25,289
You have to compose the poem
before you got there, right?

684
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:27,332
Otherwise what, you're gonna
blow out the guy's brains,

685
00:38:27,374 --> 00:38:29,251
sit down and write a little sonnet
for yourself?

686
00:38:29,292 --> 00:38:30,669
No prints on the poems,

687
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:33,713
so probably
I wore gloves when I wrote it.

688
00:38:33,755 --> 00:38:36,799
You obviously know your victims.
Between that and the easy access,

689
00:38:36,841 --> 00:38:39,176
I guess that they know you too.
They must.

690
00:38:39,218 --> 00:38:41,637
These guys are all scumbags.
They're not gonna trust anyone,

691
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:44,264
open the door for anyone,
especially if they don't know them.

692
00:38:44,306 --> 00:38:46,642
Yeah, but I more than know them.

693
00:38:46,642 --> 00:38:48,977
I know everything about them.
I know their moves,

694
00:38:49,019 --> 00:38:50,896
their patterns,
I know their schedules.

695
00:38:50,937 --> 00:38:53,731
Okay, so you're following them.
You're staking them out.

696
00:39:06,994 --> 00:39:09,579
Anyone gonna say it?

697
00:39:09,621 --> 00:39:11,539
What?

698
00:39:14,042 --> 00:39:16,711
Fuck me.

699
00:39:18,379 --> 00:39:20,256
- He's right, it's a cop.
- No.

700
00:39:20,298 --> 00:39:22,591
Let's slow down, fellows.
We're getting way ahead of ourselves.

701
00:39:22,633 --> 00:39:26,220
- Come on, it's a cop, you know it.
- I don't know shit. Neither do you.

702
00:39:26,261 --> 00:39:29,139
I'm telling your right now,
it's a cop, it's a cop, it's a cop.

703
00:39:29,181 --> 00:39:30,849
What do you mean,
"It's a cop, it's a cop, it's a cop"?

704
00:39:30,891 --> 00:39:34,185
- Where do you come off saying it's a cop?
- Easy, partner, he's just saying it.

705
00:39:34,185 --> 00:39:36,813
- What are you talking about?
- He's just saying...

706
00:39:36,854 --> 00:39:40,191
I know, I know, I know
what he's saying.

707
00:39:41,859 --> 00:39:43,611
And I'm saying it's bullshit.

708
00:39:44,611 --> 00:39:47,573
Shoot me. What the fuck?
But don't say it's a cop.

709
00:39:51,701 --> 00:39:54,913
#You cast a spell on me #

710
00:39:54,954 --> 00:39:57,498
#I was blind and now I see #

711
00:39:57,582 --> 00:40:00,543
#You work your magic,
that's the key #

712
00:40:00,584 --> 00:40:03,170
#You wave your wand #

713
00:40:03,212 --> 00:40:06,757
#And cast a spell on me... #

714
00:40:06,798 --> 00:40:08,800
Turk: So what about dinner?

715
00:40:08,842 --> 00:40:10,427
You feel like going out?

716
00:40:10,469 --> 00:40:12,262
Where?

717
00:40:12,304 --> 00:40:14,180
I don't care.
You're the one going.

718
00:40:14,222 --> 00:40:16,057
What is your problem?

719
00:40:16,099 --> 00:40:18,059
No problem.

720
00:40:18,101 --> 00:40:20,227
If you feel like hanging around,
be my guest.

721
00:40:20,269 --> 00:40:21,604
I don't feel like going out.

722
00:40:21,645 --> 00:40:24,815
Fine, just don't bug me.

723
00:40:24,857 --> 00:40:28,985
This is the best part of my day
and I don't need you fucking it up.

724
00:40:30,779 --> 00:40:33,782
So you only fuck cops?

725
00:40:33,823 --> 00:40:36,701
Once in a while
I do a fireman or an ex-con.

726
00:40:38,619 --> 00:40:40,288
You lump us in together?

727
00:40:40,329 --> 00:40:42,456
Well, I have some respect
for firemen.

728
00:40:42,498 --> 00:40:44,291
Fuck you.

729
00:40:44,333 --> 00:40:46,293
You know why they take away
your nightstick

730
00:40:46,293 --> 00:40:48,545
- when you hang up your uniform?
- No.

731
00:40:48,587 --> 00:40:50,755
They don't trust you with it.

732
00:40:50,797 --> 00:40:52,966
Right now I wouldn't trust
myself with it either.

733
00:40:53,007 --> 00:40:55,051
Shit, you'd probably love that.

734
00:40:55,093 --> 00:40:56,761
Too bad you never met
Van Luytens.

735
00:40:56,803 --> 00:40:58,471
You two really would have
hit it off great.

736
00:40:58,513 --> 00:41:00,681
At least somebody finally
brought some justice down

737
00:41:00,723 --> 00:41:02,558
on that dickless little fuck.

738
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,893
Now that is who I'd like to meet.

739
00:41:04,935 --> 00:41:06,812
Well, maybe you'll get
your wish one day.

740
00:41:06,854 --> 00:41:08,689
They think it's a cop.

741
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:10,357
- Makes sense.
- Bullshit.

742
00:41:10,398 --> 00:41:12,400
It's just some fucking psychopath.

743
00:41:12,442 --> 00:41:14,777
Well, there's plenty of those
on the job.

744
00:41:23,202 --> 00:41:24,787
- Are you sleeping well?
- Not really.

745
00:41:24,828 --> 00:41:26,330
- Yep.
- Eating well?

746
00:41:26,371 --> 00:41:27,831
- No.
- Yeah.

747
00:41:27,873 --> 00:41:29,082
Any recurring nightmares?

748
00:41:29,124 --> 00:41:31,626
Yeah, that I'm stuck
in a room with you forever.

749
00:41:32,836 --> 00:41:34,170
Nope.

750
00:41:34,212 --> 00:41:36,005
Do you think you're fit
to return to duty?

751
00:41:36,047 --> 00:41:38,049
- Abso-fucking-lutely.
- Yeah.

752
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:41,218
- You ever think about retiring?
- You mean, death with benefits?

753
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:43,053
What's not to like?

754
00:41:43,095 --> 00:41:45,055
- You ever think about retiring?
- Not really.

755
00:41:45,097 --> 00:41:47,099
What have I got to look forward to?

756
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:49,351
Sailing my 26-footer
around Sheepshead Bay,

757
00:41:49,393 --> 00:41:50,810
umpiring cops' softball?

758
00:41:50,852 --> 00:41:52,937
- How about corporate security work?
- It's too dangerous.

759
00:41:52,979 --> 00:41:56,232
- So what are you gonna do?
- Maybe I'll buy a boat.

760
00:41:56,274 --> 00:41:57,316
Turk: All right, look,
I don't know if I believe this,

761
00:41:57,316 --> 00:41:58,359
Turk: All right, look,
I don't know if I believe this,

762
00:41:58,401 --> 00:42:00,194
but I'm just gonna
throw it out there.

763
00:42:00,236 --> 00:42:02,530
You guys say we're looking
for one of our own,

764
00:42:02,571 --> 00:42:06,533
but what if it was an ex-cop,
somebody with an axe to grind?

765
00:42:06,575 --> 00:42:08,243
You got one in mind?

766
00:42:08,285 --> 00:42:11,413
He's thinking about Martin Baum

767
00:42:11,454 --> 00:42:14,207
our old lieutenant.

768
00:42:14,249 --> 00:42:16,626
So what's the story with him?

769
00:42:16,668 --> 00:42:18,669
He got fired a few years ago.

770
00:42:18,711 --> 00:42:21,881
I'm not saying there's any motive,
but he knew all the victims.

771
00:42:21,922 --> 00:42:25,509
Yeah, but Turk,
I knew most of those guys.

772
00:42:25,551 --> 00:42:28,720
So did you, Riley, Perez.
Even Karen knew 'em.

773
00:42:28,762 --> 00:42:30,805
- I'm just throwing it out there.
- Well, maybe you killed 'em.

774
00:42:30,847 --> 00:42:34,142
Yeah, maybe I did.

775
00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:36,352
The poems and the placement
of the weapons

776
00:42:36,394 --> 00:42:38,187
are all we've got
linking the kills,

777
00:42:38,229 --> 00:42:40,940
which means what we gotta do now
is get humping on the forensics.

778
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:43,317
That shouldn't be
too much of a problem.

779
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:45,360
We already got the girl
working on that.

780
00:42:45,402 --> 00:42:49,156
That's right, Karen's been
humping on it all week, as we speak.

781
00:42:49,197 --> 00:42:51,658
What did you say?

782
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:52,951
Here we go again.

783
00:42:52,992 --> 00:42:54,786
- You should watch your mouth.
- Oh, yeah?

784
00:42:54,786 --> 00:42:57,288
He didn't mean anything by it.
Karen and him are ancient history.

785
00:42:57,288 --> 00:42:59,457
- College boy can't speak for himself?
- Yeah, I can speak for myself.

786
00:42:59,498 --> 00:43:01,292
Let me speak for myself...
fuck you, Turk.

787
00:43:01,333 --> 00:43:03,294
Mutt, I'm gonna hit you
on the head with this barbell.

788
00:43:03,335 --> 00:43:05,421
I'm not better than you.
You're not better than me, man.

789
00:43:05,462 --> 00:43:07,172
You put your balls
in your pocket.

790
00:43:07,214 --> 00:43:08,882
And you, fellow officers,

791
00:43:08,924 --> 00:43:13,136
a little courtesy
for a fellow professional, you know?

792
00:43:13,178 --> 00:43:16,180
Please. Are we gonna move on
here now?

793
00:43:16,222 --> 00:43:18,224
What are we doing?
Where were we?

794
00:43:18,266 --> 00:43:21,811
Talking about Martin Baum.
What's his story?

795
00:43:21,852 --> 00:43:24,355
Some guys under him
got caught taking money.

796
00:43:24,396 --> 00:43:26,648
Baum stood up for them,
tried to cover it up.

797
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:29,109
He do time?

798
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:31,987
Well, they pressed charges,
but he plead out and resigned.

799
00:43:32,028 --> 00:43:33,988
So what's his beef with you?

800
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:35,865
I could have lied to protect him,
but I didn't.

801
00:43:35,907 --> 00:43:38,910
Okay, but if he's got a beef with you,
why not go after you?

802
00:43:38,951 --> 00:43:41,454
Why not kill you? Why go around
acting like a serial killer,

803
00:43:41,495 --> 00:43:43,330
killing all these degenerates?
It doesn't make any sense.

804
00:43:43,372 --> 00:43:45,833
- I'm just telling you.
- I'm telling you it doesn't make sense.

805
00:43:45,874 --> 00:43:47,918
I'm throwing it out there.
I'm saying this is what it is.

806
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,045
You want to check him out or not?
I don't give a shit.

807
00:43:50,086 --> 00:43:52,630
- It doesn't make any sense.
- You're the ones that think it's a cop.

808
00:43:52,672 --> 00:43:54,591
I'm just saying here's a cop
with a chip on his shoulder.

809
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,634
Check him out if you want.
I don't give a shit.

810
00:43:56,676 --> 00:44:00,012
Calm down and give a better reason
why Baum could be a suspect, okay?

811
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,806
(door slams)

812
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:04,266
PMS, gotta be.

813
00:44:11,064 --> 00:44:13,942
- Hey, guys.
- What's going on?

814
00:44:13,983 --> 00:44:16,402
I came over to bring you
the FBI report

815
00:44:16,402 --> 00:44:18,404
on the paper
and handwriting.

816
00:44:18,404 --> 00:44:20,531
You don't have a problem
with me looking over the evidence

817
00:44:20,573 --> 00:44:23,033
that I collected and processed
for you, do you?

818
00:44:23,075 --> 00:44:24,952
- No problem.
- Put it back, Karen.

819
00:44:24,993 --> 00:44:26,995
- This is fascinating.
- Let's go, come on.

820
00:44:27,037 --> 00:44:28,997
Come on, let's go, let's go.

821
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:30,832
- What?
- Come on, let's go.

822
00:44:30,874 --> 00:44:32,876
Get your hands off me.

823
00:44:32,917 --> 00:44:35,169
I'll give you a little privacy.
I don't want to interrupt anything here.

824
00:44:35,211 --> 00:44:37,004
Are you afraid of me
looking at your old case files?

825
00:44:37,046 --> 00:44:39,507
- Is that it?
- Okay, I'm gone. Enjoy.

826
00:44:39,548 --> 00:44:41,550
- What?
- What is it with you?

827
00:44:41,592 --> 00:44:43,594
- What is it with you?
- (door slams)

828
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:50,392
I'm sorry about last night, okay?

829
00:44:50,475 --> 00:44:53,103
I really am. It's a habit.

830
00:44:53,144 --> 00:44:56,064
Habits can be broken, right?

831
00:44:56,105 --> 00:44:57,482
That's bullshit.

832
00:44:57,523 --> 00:44:58,774
No.

833
00:44:58,816 --> 00:45:01,318
I'm totally serious, all right?

834
00:45:02,778 --> 00:45:05,072
It's not bullshit,

835
00:45:05,114 --> 00:45:07,074
really.

836
00:45:13,788 --> 00:45:16,249
Perez: Why do you think
Turk was so quick to take the lead

837
00:45:16,291 --> 00:45:19,168
on the poetry case, huh?
To keep us from finding the killer, man.

838
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:21,587
That's what I would do
if I was covering my tracks.

839
00:45:21,629 --> 00:45:24,548
He sticks us on this Baum stakeout
'cause it's more misdirection.

840
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:25,758
Makes sense.

841
00:45:25,799 --> 00:45:27,968
I hate that Turk, man.

842
00:45:34,682 --> 00:45:36,642
(buzzing)

843
00:45:56,661 --> 00:45:58,663
Hey, he's coming out.
He's coming out.

844
00:46:00,873 --> 00:46:03,209
Oh, at 2:45 in the morning.

845
00:46:06,503 --> 00:46:09,965
Is it killing time
or is he just killing time?

846
00:46:29,608 --> 00:46:32,068
Come on, Baum,
go kill someone already.

847
00:46:32,110 --> 00:46:34,654
Perez: Yeah, kill Turk, man.
He's the one setting you up.

848
00:46:34,696 --> 00:46:36,155
Do us all a favor.

849
00:46:41,285 --> 00:46:43,787
Hey, did you see Turk's
marksmanship scores?

850
00:46:43,829 --> 00:46:45,372
Did you see this?
It's ridiculous.

851
00:46:45,456 --> 00:46:47,332
Service... 99,
70 out of 100.

852
00:46:47,374 --> 00:46:50,794
Combat Association awards,
department commendations.

853
00:46:50,835 --> 00:46:53,254
This guy could take out your left nut
at 50 yards.

854
00:46:56,507 --> 00:46:58,551
Perez: Did you see the computer
trajectories, man?

855
00:46:58,593 --> 00:47:00,011
Not one stray slug.

856
00:47:00,052 --> 00:47:02,388
Even Berkowitz put a couple
in the Corinthian leather.

857
00:47:07,517 --> 00:47:09,978
Riley: What about Karen?
She come up with anything new?

858
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:11,896
Perez: No, not yet.

859
00:47:11,938 --> 00:47:13,898
If Baum kills somebody
I don't want us to be in the car

860
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:16,317
waiting when it happens, okay?

861
00:47:18,152 --> 00:47:19,779
I'll go.

862
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:21,822
Attaboy, Teddy, attaboy.

863
00:47:21,864 --> 00:47:23,240
I'm proud of you, son.

864
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:28,412
(lighter clicks)

865
00:47:34,459 --> 00:47:36,627
(cocks gun)
You're Perez, right?

866
00:47:36,669 --> 00:47:38,004
Yeah.

867
00:47:38,004 --> 00:47:39,714
I'm Martin Baum.

868
00:47:43,342 --> 00:47:45,469
I got a permit for this.

869
00:47:45,511 --> 00:47:48,221
I work security
in the diamond district.

870
00:47:48,263 --> 00:47:51,057
So you figure it's a cop
doing the poetry killings?

871
00:47:51,099 --> 00:47:53,977
Someone says, "Check out Baum.
He thinks he got a raw deal."

872
00:47:54,018 --> 00:47:56,437
That's what passes
for police work these days?

873
00:47:56,479 --> 00:47:57,980
Do you think
you got a raw deal?

874
00:47:58,022 --> 00:47:59,857
Damn straight.

875
00:47:59,899 --> 00:48:02,234
- Life sucks.
- Yeah.

876
00:48:02,276 --> 00:48:04,820
- Everything okay, Simon?
- Teddy, where the fuck were you, man?

877
00:48:04,862 --> 00:48:07,197
Anything else you want to tell us,
Lieutenant Baum?

878
00:48:07,197 --> 00:48:11,117
- I got something for you in my pocket.
- Huh-uh!

879
00:48:12,661 --> 00:48:17,373
A passport, credit card receipts,
boarding passes.

880
00:48:17,415 --> 00:48:19,417
The day Brady was killed

881
00:48:19,458 --> 00:48:21,627
I was escorting a client
to Brazil.

882
00:48:25,964 --> 00:48:29,051
Man: Judgment is
the dominion of the Lord.

883
00:48:29,092 --> 00:48:32,012
And if this person,
this worthless rapist

884
00:48:32,053 --> 00:48:34,556
or murderer,
as you describe him,

885
00:48:34,597 --> 00:48:38,017
if he is truly repentant
and seeks absolution,

886
00:48:38,059 --> 00:48:40,394
it must be granted to him.

887
00:48:40,436 --> 00:48:42,897
Your name doesn't ring a bell,

888
00:48:42,938 --> 00:48:47,192
but I've had so many
altar boys over the years.

889
00:48:47,234 --> 00:48:49,903
(muffled gunshot)

890
00:48:51,279 --> 00:48:53,281
Turk's voice: So many altar boys

891
00:48:53,323 --> 00:48:56,034
that it's hard to remember
their names.

892
00:48:56,075 --> 00:48:59,120
My name is david Fisk,
detective First Grade.

893
00:48:59,161 --> 00:49:01,414
You may not
remember me now,

894
00:49:01,455 --> 00:49:04,625
but I guarantee you'll remember my name
for the rest of your life.

895
00:49:04,667 --> 00:49:08,545
Father Connell,
may he rot in hell.

896
00:49:08,587 --> 00:49:11,047
13 down, one to go.

897
00:49:11,089 --> 00:49:13,758
(bells tolling)

898
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:16,135
(police radio chatter)

899
00:49:19,472 --> 00:49:23,100
Karen: White underwear
below the knee.

900
00:49:23,142 --> 00:49:25,602
- (camera shutter clicking)
- Briefs-style.

901
00:49:25,644 --> 00:49:28,063
Large tweezers.

902
00:49:28,105 --> 00:49:31,566
I am removing a card that has been
inserted in the rectum of the deceased

903
00:49:31,608 --> 00:49:35,612
and placing it
in a plastic evidence bag.

904
00:49:38,322 --> 00:49:42,076
- I'll be right back.
- All right.

905
00:49:43,744 --> 00:49:46,371
Hey. It's another one,

906
00:49:46,413 --> 00:49:48,623
handwritten.

907
00:49:51,876 --> 00:49:54,671
"The old man
who the children trust,

908
00:49:54,712 --> 00:49:58,341
Unable to control his lust,

909
00:49:58,382 --> 00:50:01,260
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

910
00:50:01,302 --> 00:50:05,347
The church can't stop him.
Someone must."

911
00:50:06,723 --> 00:50:08,725
I'll see what else I can find.

912
00:50:14,314 --> 00:50:16,566
What's the matter with you?

913
00:50:16,607 --> 00:50:18,901
Father Connell gave me
my first communion

914
00:50:18,943 --> 00:50:21,695
back in Bensonhurst.

915
00:50:24,073 --> 00:50:26,575
Hey, guys.
Sorry we didn't get a chance to call.

916
00:50:26,617 --> 00:50:29,703
- Yeah, I bet you are.
- Go over there, take a look around.

917
00:50:29,744 --> 00:50:31,871
We'll compare notes later, okay?

918
00:50:31,913 --> 00:50:35,041
Looks like our friend just settled
an old score with the priest,

919
00:50:35,083 --> 00:50:37,043
left him with his pants down.

920
00:50:37,085 --> 00:50:38,711
- Come on.
- No, look.

921
00:50:38,753 --> 00:50:40,254
Come on, don't talk like that.

922
00:50:40,254 --> 00:50:42,256
- Hey, look for yourself.
- Have a little respect.

923
00:50:43,757 --> 00:50:46,969
Next thing they're gonna tell us
Lieutenant Baum was an altar boy here.

924
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:50,430
Tell me about it.
These two guys fucking stink.

925
00:50:50,472 --> 00:50:52,807
Look, doctor,
you read the poems.

926
00:50:52,849 --> 00:50:55,059
It is possible, right,
that this guy is a cop?

927
00:50:55,101 --> 00:50:57,478
I've never seen it.

928
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:00,314
I've never even heard
about a cop serial killer.

929
00:51:00,356 --> 00:51:02,525
Come on, girls,
let's go, let's go.

930
00:51:03,525 --> 00:51:07,487
Yeah. Go go go go go
go go go go!

931
00:51:07,529 --> 00:51:08,572
Safe.

932
00:51:08,613 --> 00:51:11,074
Doc, give us a tip.
How are we gonna catch this guy?

933
00:51:11,116 --> 00:51:13,076
You don't have to worry
about that.

934
00:51:13,118 --> 00:51:14,786
He wants to get caught.

935
00:51:17,121 --> 00:51:19,790
You don't have any better place
to have lunch?

936
00:51:19,790 --> 00:51:21,625
I wanted to thank you.

937
00:51:21,625 --> 00:51:23,377
What, about Spider?

938
00:51:23,419 --> 00:51:25,087
Yeah.

939
00:51:25,129 --> 00:51:27,714
And for looking in on me
at the hospital

940
00:51:27,756 --> 00:51:29,257
and the encouragement.

941
00:51:29,341 --> 00:51:30,634
Why would he want that?

942
00:51:30,634 --> 00:51:33,219
After a while
getting away with it isn't enough.

943
00:51:33,261 --> 00:51:35,263
Jessica: So is your daughter
on the team?

944
00:51:35,305 --> 00:51:38,141
No, she used to play,
but now she's 25, living in California,

945
00:51:38,182 --> 00:51:40,851
five years sober
and working as a nurse.

946
00:51:40,893 --> 00:51:43,062
And her mother?

947
00:51:43,103 --> 00:51:45,105
Her mother died
when she was very young.

948
00:51:46,148 --> 00:51:49,067
Doctor: He wants everybody to know
that he got away with it,

949
00:51:49,109 --> 00:51:53,113
to show everybody
just how brilliant he is.

950
00:51:53,196 --> 00:51:56,324
Most of these killings were criminals
in Rooster's and his beat, right?

951
00:51:56,366 --> 00:51:58,242
And then he all but threatens
to kill Van Luytens

952
00:51:58,284 --> 00:52:00,244
in front of hundreds of witnesses.
And then he sends us

953
00:52:00,286 --> 00:52:03,330
on this crazy wild goose chase
after Lieutenant Baum, didn't he?

954
00:52:03,372 --> 00:52:05,374
- Yes, he did.
- Why would he do that? Why?

955
00:52:05,416 --> 00:52:07,960
You gotta show me more than that.
So far you got shit.

956
00:52:08,001 --> 00:52:09,586
- Give him more, man.
- You want more?

957
00:52:09,628 --> 00:52:12,255
- How about the church records?
- The very ones that Turk was

958
00:52:12,297 --> 00:52:14,215
so diligently pursuing.
How about that?

959
00:52:14,257 --> 00:52:17,176
It turns out our most recent victim,
the late Father Connell,

960
00:52:17,218 --> 00:52:19,929
was moved all over the place...
eight parishes in 20 years.

961
00:52:19,971 --> 00:52:22,473
Why would they do that
with a Catholic priest? It's obvious.

962
00:52:22,515 --> 00:52:25,017
He's giving the children
more than communion behind the altar.

963
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:27,477
Now Turk already admits
to knowing this guy as a child.

964
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,854
It's very plausible.

965
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:33,441
Lieutenant: This priest,
this Father Connell,

966
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:35,193
he gave you your first
holy communion, eh?

967
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:36,361
He did.

968
00:52:36,402 --> 00:52:39,614
Did he every try to do
anything inappropriate? I mean...

969
00:52:39,655 --> 00:52:41,657
I know what you mean.
No, never.

970
00:52:43,367 --> 00:52:45,369
Okay, fine.
Is there any reason

971
00:52:45,411 --> 00:52:47,621
why somebody out there
might think that he did?

972
00:52:47,663 --> 00:52:49,206
No.

973
00:52:49,247 --> 00:52:51,583
Am I a suspect here, Lieutenant?

974
00:52:52,625 --> 00:52:54,669
No,

975
00:52:54,711 --> 00:52:58,548
but these bodies
are starting to smell.

976
00:52:58,589 --> 00:53:01,175
A lot of it is drifting
in your direction.

977
00:53:01,217 --> 00:53:03,219
Drifting or being pushed?

978
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:05,345
What can I say?

979
00:53:05,387 --> 00:53:07,806
You got connections
to most of these victims.

980
00:53:07,848 --> 00:53:10,767
You're not exactly
Mother Teresa.

981
00:53:12,102 --> 00:53:14,979
I never had any problem
with that priest.

982
00:53:15,021 --> 00:53:17,940
Okay. Okay, fine.

983
00:53:17,982 --> 00:53:20,735
That settles it.

984
00:53:26,865 --> 00:53:28,950
I had a talk with Riley and Perez.

985
00:53:28,992 --> 00:53:30,535
Good cops.

986
00:53:30,577 --> 00:53:33,038
Don't fuck around, okay?
Just listen.

987
00:53:33,079 --> 00:53:34,330
I'm listening.

988
00:53:34,372 --> 00:53:36,791
They think
Turk might be our guy.

989
00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:42,922
Oh, man. I gotta tell you,

990
00:53:42,963 --> 00:53:45,632
from where I'm sitting
that is so fucking funny.

991
00:53:45,674 --> 00:53:47,759
You can't take that seriously.

992
00:53:47,801 --> 00:53:50,762
Everybody has pretty much
accepted the fact

993
00:53:50,804 --> 00:53:53,348
- that we're chasing one of our own.
- But it ain't Turk.

994
00:53:53,389 --> 00:53:55,141
Sure as I'm sitting here
he ain't the guy.

995
00:53:55,183 --> 00:53:56,809
- You know that?
- Yes, I do.

996
00:53:56,851 --> 00:53:59,353
- How do you know that?
- Because I know it.

997
00:53:59,353 --> 00:54:01,939
I know it to a moral certainty.

998
00:54:01,981 --> 00:54:03,440
Okay?

999
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:06,652
This priest,

1000
00:54:06,693 --> 00:54:09,279
this Father Connell...

1001
00:54:09,321 --> 00:54:11,615
he was Turk's priest
when he was a kid.

1002
00:54:11,656 --> 00:54:12,657
He told you that.

1003
00:54:12,699 --> 00:54:15,034
He didn't tell me this priest
was a child molester.

1004
00:54:15,034 --> 00:54:17,995
- I can't believe this bullshit.
- Believe it, all right?

1005
00:54:18,037 --> 00:54:20,581
- Turk's a good guy.
- You understand?

1006
00:54:20,623 --> 00:54:22,875
- He's the best cop you got.
- Don't you tell me what I gotta do.

1007
00:54:22,917 --> 00:54:25,002
Don't you say a goddamn word
to him about this either,

1008
00:54:25,044 --> 00:54:26,962
or you're finished.

1009
00:54:30,298 --> 00:54:33,802
(humming a tune)

1010
00:54:36,888 --> 00:54:38,890
Can I speak now?

1011
00:54:38,931 --> 00:54:40,725
Feel free.

1012
00:54:41,725 --> 00:54:45,562
He cares.
You know what I'm saying?

1013
00:54:45,604 --> 00:54:48,523
Turk cares about people.

1014
00:54:49,858 --> 00:54:52,861
I know he runs around
like a pit bull on crack sometimes.

1015
00:54:52,902 --> 00:54:55,488
It doesn't matter.

1016
00:54:55,530 --> 00:54:57,782
He cares about protecting people.

1017
00:54:57,824 --> 00:54:59,867
And if you don't back him,

1018
00:54:59,951 --> 00:55:03,787
you will regret it.

1019
00:55:23,305 --> 00:55:24,973
(bangs)

1020
00:55:25,015 --> 00:55:26,517
Jesus.

1021
00:55:26,558 --> 00:55:28,268
Sorry.

1022
00:55:28,310 --> 00:55:31,021
I just never rattled
anyone's cage before.

1023
00:55:31,062 --> 00:55:34,107
- Got a minute?
- Yeah, what's up?

1024
00:55:34,149 --> 00:55:37,568
You know me and Turk
are buddies, right?

1025
00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:39,111
Of course.

1026
00:55:39,153 --> 00:55:40,613
I'd do anything for him.

1027
00:55:40,654 --> 00:55:43,073
He would do anything for you.

1028
00:55:43,115 --> 00:55:44,325
Would you?

1029
00:55:44,366 --> 00:55:45,909
Would I what?

1030
00:55:45,951 --> 00:55:47,953
Would you do anything for him?

1031
00:55:51,498 --> 00:55:53,333
I don't know...
where is this going?

1032
00:55:53,333 --> 00:55:55,376
He wants you
to have sex with me.

1033
00:55:57,503 --> 00:55:59,422
Really?

1034
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:03,175
He wouldn't mind.

1035
00:56:03,175 --> 00:56:05,886
But that's not why I'm here.

1036
00:56:05,928 --> 00:56:08,597
Okay, why are you here?

1037
00:56:08,638 --> 00:56:11,850
Where were you
the night Rambo was killed

1038
00:56:11,891 --> 00:56:14,852
and Trager?
Got an alibi for those nights?

1039
00:56:16,354 --> 00:56:19,607
I mean, did you know either one
those guys before they were murdered?

1040
00:56:19,649 --> 00:56:22,610
Makes you uncomfortable
when I talk like that.

1041
00:56:22,651 --> 00:56:25,446
You look like you're guilty.
You're not guilty.

1042
00:56:25,487 --> 00:56:27,572
I know that.
You didn't kill those guys, did you?

1043
00:56:31,243 --> 00:56:34,287
Now you know what Turk feels.

1044
00:56:38,332 --> 00:56:42,044
I need you to get me
some information

1045
00:56:42,086 --> 00:56:44,129
discreetly.

1046
00:56:45,756 --> 00:56:47,215
Can you do that for me?

1047
00:56:47,257 --> 00:56:49,509
You got it.

1048
00:56:49,551 --> 00:56:51,219
Absolutely.

1049
00:56:51,261 --> 00:56:53,221
Let's solve these fucking murders.

1050
00:56:55,431 --> 00:56:57,558
(phone rings)

1051
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:58,976
Oh.

1052
00:56:59,018 --> 00:57:01,103
- Rooster: Hey, boy genius.
- Perfect timing, buddy.

1053
00:57:01,145 --> 00:57:03,188
Listen, you really worked
on Hingis, didn't you?

1054
00:57:03,230 --> 00:57:04,898
He was all worked up
about my partner.

1055
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:06,859
Good. He should be.

1056
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:09,444
I think we should sit down,
see if we can square things, okay?

1057
00:57:09,486 --> 00:57:12,697
All right. Want to meet at Montrose
at 8:00 PM?

1058
00:57:12,739 --> 00:57:16,034
Could you make that 9:00?
I gotta meet an old friend.

1059
00:57:16,075 --> 00:57:17,702
Yeah, sure, whatever you want.

1060
00:57:20,246 --> 00:57:23,540
(blues playing)
#Baby's got issues #

1061
00:57:23,582 --> 00:57:27,044
#Baby's got pains... #

1062
00:57:27,085 --> 00:57:29,087
- Hey, fellows.
- Hey.

1063
00:57:29,129 --> 00:57:32,257
Thanks for coming.

1064
00:57:32,298 --> 00:57:34,926
- This here is Cheryl Brooks.
- Hello, Cheryl Brooks.

1065
00:57:34,968 --> 00:57:36,969
Cheryl's got something to tell you.

1066
00:57:38,137 --> 00:57:41,766
My daughter Lynn

1067
00:57:41,807 --> 00:57:44,351
died four years ago.

1068
00:57:44,393 --> 00:57:47,312
She was 10 years old.
She was raped and she was murdered.

1069
00:57:49,439 --> 00:57:53,568
The guy I was living with,
Charles...

1070
00:57:53,610 --> 00:57:54,777
Charles Randall.

1071
00:57:54,819 --> 00:57:57,905
Yeah, Charles Randall... he did it.

1072
00:57:57,947 --> 00:58:00,741
Why are you telling us this?

1073
00:58:00,783 --> 00:58:03,911
Because he got off for that.
He was acquitted at trial.

1074
00:58:03,953 --> 00:58:06,163
- Because?
- Because?

1075
00:58:07,956 --> 00:58:10,250
I testified for him.

1076
00:58:10,292 --> 00:58:13,128
- You did what?
- I said he was with me.

1077
00:58:14,671 --> 00:58:18,382
You see, Cheryl here is
a very forgiving person,

1078
00:58:18,424 --> 00:58:20,718
unlike us hard-asses.

1079
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:23,012
- He threatened to kill me.
- Okay, Cheryl.

1080
00:58:23,053 --> 00:58:26,515
Now you say goodbye
to the nice officers

1081
00:58:26,557 --> 00:58:30,393
and you go on back home.

1082
00:58:30,435 --> 00:58:33,229
Don't drink yourself to death.

1083
00:58:35,356 --> 00:58:37,859
Okay, so...

1084
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:40,277
eh?

1085
00:58:43,197 --> 00:58:45,908
I want to hear you say it.

1086
00:58:45,949 --> 00:58:48,535
Come on, say it.

1087
00:58:52,997 --> 00:58:57,001
We planted the gun
in Randall's apartment, okay?

1088
00:58:57,043 --> 00:58:59,378
I said it. Happy?

1089
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:01,005
- Thank you.
- Yes, I am.

1090
00:59:01,047 --> 00:59:03,799
I'd do it again if I had to
'cause that fucking maggot

1091
00:59:03,841 --> 00:59:07,636
could rot away for all eternity.
I'd sleep just fine.

1092
00:59:07,678 --> 00:59:09,096
So what do you want from us?

1093
00:59:09,096 --> 00:59:11,598
You guys think
my partner's a serial killer.

1094
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:13,433
You're way off.

1095
00:59:13,475 --> 00:59:16,561
You like Turk for this thing?
Go have your fun.

1096
00:59:16,602 --> 00:59:18,980
I'll go along with you.

1097
00:59:19,021 --> 00:59:21,565
I'll even help you.

1098
00:59:21,607 --> 00:59:25,277
But do not drag up Chuck Randall
and that fucking gun,

1099
00:59:25,319 --> 00:59:28,780
because if he walks out of jail
he's gonna end up dead.

1100
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:30,866
Excuse me?

1101
00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:35,870
I'll put two
through his fucking head

1102
00:59:35,912 --> 00:59:38,456
myself.

1103
00:59:38,498 --> 00:59:40,791
Done deal.

1104
00:59:40,791 --> 00:59:43,919
(soprano singing)

1105
00:59:53,803 --> 00:59:56,764
My grandmother loved opera.

1106
00:59:56,806 --> 00:59:58,808
She supported us by sewing.

1107
00:59:58,849 --> 01:00:01,936
I used to thread needles
for my grandmother.

1108
01:00:02,019 --> 01:00:04,313
- Gave all her money to church.
- You admired her?

1109
01:00:04,355 --> 01:00:06,481
I worshipped her.

1110
01:00:06,523 --> 01:00:09,317
Rooster? Yeah, he's religious,
goes to church.

1111
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:11,027
Prosky: How about you?

1112
01:00:11,069 --> 01:00:14,656
Turk's voice: Our job is keeping
99% of the population safe

1113
01:00:14,697 --> 01:00:18,159
from the other 1%.

1114
01:00:18,201 --> 01:00:21,787
The problem is that we have to
spend half our lives with that 1%.

1115
01:00:21,829 --> 01:00:23,622
And the better we do that job,

1116
01:00:23,664 --> 01:00:26,208
the less the other 99% think
they need us.

1117
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:28,877
They're clueless.

1118
01:00:28,919 --> 01:00:30,879
The only ones paying attention
on the street

1119
01:00:30,879 --> 01:00:33,298
are the cops and the criminals.
Everyone else is just

1120
01:00:33,339 --> 01:00:36,092
going somewhere
or shopping.

1121
01:00:41,722 --> 01:00:43,932
- Umpire: Out.
- Come on.

1122
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:46,476
I got an order here placing you
on restricted duty.

1123
01:00:46,518 --> 01:00:49,020
Now in plain English that means
you'll work at your desk.

1124
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:51,106
You might want to cooperate
with the shrink

1125
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:53,900
next time you two meet,
and you will meet again.

1126
01:00:57,862 --> 01:01:00,781
Cool my fucking heels.
Cool my fucking heels, huh?

1127
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:03,534
I'm gonna blow a fucking hole
in that motherfucker Perez

1128
01:01:03,575 --> 01:01:06,453
and blow right through his head
for putting me through this bullshit.

1129
01:01:06,495 --> 01:01:08,413
- Turk.
- Fuck, I'm gonna...

1130
01:01:08,413 --> 01:01:09,748
kill that motherfucker.

1131
01:01:09,748 --> 01:01:12,584
Calm down. What the hell is it?
You're making all the wrong moves.

1132
01:01:12,584 --> 01:01:14,419
What are you talking about?
This ain't a chess game, partner.

1133
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:16,921
Who knows? Maybe it is.
You go at Perez now...

1134
01:01:16,921 --> 01:01:19,423
you know what's gonna happen?
You're gonna walk right into a trap.

1135
01:01:19,465 --> 01:01:21,634
You are.
They're just waiting for you.

1136
01:01:21,675 --> 01:01:23,385
Fucking Hingis.

1137
01:01:23,427 --> 01:01:25,679
Fucking Hingis believes him.

1138
01:01:25,721 --> 01:01:28,724
He actually fucking believes
that motherfucking Perez.

1139
01:01:28,765 --> 01:01:30,225
Stay back. Wait.

1140
01:01:30,267 --> 01:01:33,728
Wait for the right time,
then fire away.

1141
01:01:33,770 --> 01:01:35,605
Not now. Now is not the right time.

1142
01:01:35,647 --> 01:01:37,940
Believe me.

1143
01:01:37,982 --> 01:01:40,318
You believe me?
Now is not the time.

1144
01:01:40,359 --> 01:01:41,444
Uh-huh.

1145
01:01:41,485 --> 01:01:43,612
- Please.
- Yeah.

1146
01:01:43,654 --> 01:01:47,449
Hey, Turk, I gotta skip tonight.
My class ran late.

1147
01:01:47,491 --> 01:01:49,868
(over phone) But I'll see you
tomorrow, all right?

1148
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:52,787
And I'm sorry about what happened
with you and Lieutenant Hingis today.

1149
01:01:52,829 --> 01:01:54,956
It's gonna be fine.
It'll blow over.

1150
01:01:54,998 --> 01:01:57,959
People are just... everyone's crazy.
People are overreacting.

1151
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,628
All right? Good night.

1152
01:02:06,884 --> 01:02:09,052
It's a cop, it's a cop, it's a cop.

1153
01:02:15,850 --> 01:02:18,144
(car engine starts)

1154
01:02:18,186 --> 01:02:20,604
What you got for me, good-looking?

1155
01:02:25,818 --> 01:02:28,862
Mark my words, there's a reason
Perez is gunning for me.

1156
01:02:28,904 --> 01:02:31,656
- (tenor singing)
- Perez is too smart to be that stupid.

1157
01:02:31,698 --> 01:02:34,325
For one thing, all that college-boy crap...
that's bullshit.

1158
01:02:34,367 --> 01:02:36,577
He did one year at SUNY,
only one year.

1159
01:02:36,619 --> 01:02:37,620
No kidding.

1160
01:02:37,662 --> 01:02:40,039
They threw him out...
disruptive influence.

1161
01:02:40,081 --> 01:02:42,791
And I hear from the 240 he mixed it up bad
with a captain over there.

1162
01:02:42,833 --> 01:02:45,043
The guy is a total
fucking asshole.

1163
01:02:45,085 --> 01:02:46,920
(man with Russian accent)
BMW 3 series,

1164
01:02:46,962 --> 01:02:49,297
Mercedes CLK... too light.

1165
01:02:49,339 --> 01:02:52,300
BMW 7 series...
the biggest engine.

1166
01:02:52,342 --> 01:02:55,011
That's what you have to get.
If they shoot at you,

1167
01:02:55,053 --> 01:02:57,847
you still want
to get the fuck out of there...

1168
01:02:57,889 --> 01:02:59,515
(men laughing)

1169
01:02:59,557 --> 01:03:01,392
(imitating)
Bentley... very good

1170
01:03:01,434 --> 01:03:04,228
because can fuck two prostitutes
in back seat

1171
01:03:04,228 --> 01:03:07,981
and mount flame-thrower
on the hood. Da?

1172
01:03:08,023 --> 01:03:09,357
Da.

1173
01:03:09,399 --> 01:03:11,735
- Man: What about a Cadillac?
- Russian: Come on,

1174
01:03:11,735 --> 01:03:15,238
the fucking car can't turn
fucking corner. Are you kidding me?

1175
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:17,115
You know either one of those
Neanderthals?

1176
01:03:17,156 --> 01:03:19,909
The wop is Joe Scianci from Bensonhurst.
He's a mid-level guy.

1177
01:03:19,950 --> 01:03:21,911
What about lvan?

1178
01:03:21,952 --> 01:03:23,746
Russian guy,
Yevgeny Magulat,

1179
01:03:23,787 --> 01:03:27,916
an enforcer for the Italians,
works with Gambinos a lot.

1180
01:03:29,126 --> 01:03:30,919
(speaking Russian)

1181
01:03:32,379 --> 01:03:35,048
That shit's getting to me.

1182
01:03:35,089 --> 01:03:37,091
I know it's getting to you.

1183
01:03:38,843 --> 01:03:41,303
Shit gets to me too, you know,

1184
01:03:41,303 --> 01:03:44,431
but I take it in, I let it out
on my own terms.

1185
01:03:46,016 --> 01:03:48,101
I bet you didn't write
one word down

1186
01:03:48,143 --> 01:03:50,020
in that little notebook
Prosky gave us.

1187
01:03:50,061 --> 01:03:52,605
Of course not. Did you?

1188
01:03:52,647 --> 01:03:54,983
Yeah, it's great.

1189
01:03:56,567 --> 01:03:58,945
It helps me put things in perspective.

1190
01:03:58,986 --> 01:04:02,948
You know what I'm saying?
Write it down, get it out.

1191
01:04:02,990 --> 01:04:05,534
- You should try this.
- Let's have a look.

1192
01:04:05,576 --> 01:04:08,203
What, are you kidding me?
Oh, come on, come on.

1193
01:04:08,245 --> 01:04:10,705
This belongs to me... private.

1194
01:04:10,747 --> 01:04:15,126
- You don't want to let me see?
- Close to my heart. No, sir.

1195
01:04:15,168 --> 01:04:17,336
I just got sick
of the whole fucking game...

1196
01:04:17,378 --> 01:04:19,839
run around looking for clues,
making arrests,

1197
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:22,424
write reports, testify, cut deals.

1198
01:04:22,466 --> 01:04:25,344
It was all just so much
fucking bullshit.

1199
01:04:25,385 --> 01:04:28,221
(man whistles)

1200
01:04:28,263 --> 01:04:29,431
Detective...

1201
01:04:29,473 --> 01:04:31,474
(muffled gunshots)

1202
01:04:35,186 --> 01:04:36,562
Then it all got real simple.

1203
01:04:36,604 --> 01:04:39,649
Yeah, detective Perez here.
Hey, brother, what's up?

1204
01:04:39,690 --> 01:04:42,610
I hate scumbags. I like shooting people.
What was I giving up?

1205
01:04:42,651 --> 01:04:45,654
Perez: Hey, look, I set the meeting up
with Rooster first thing tomorrow.

1206
01:04:45,696 --> 01:04:49,074
Come on, you gotta be fast, man.
I don't want Turk getting wind of anything.

1207
01:04:49,116 --> 01:04:51,493
A retirement party and a gold watch?

1208
01:04:51,534 --> 01:04:54,329
A handshake from the mayor
and my name on some fucking plaque?

1209
01:04:54,370 --> 01:04:57,081
(speaking indistinctly)

1210
01:04:57,123 --> 01:05:00,543
(gunshots)

1211
01:05:00,584 --> 01:05:01,752
Big fucking deal.

1212
01:05:04,004 --> 01:05:05,005
It's better this way.

1213
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:09,676
Now everybody knows
who I was and where I stood.

1214
01:05:49,713 --> 01:05:51,381
(dials)

1215
01:05:53,133 --> 01:05:55,134
Hey, it's me.

1216
01:05:56,636 --> 01:06:00,097
Listen, I think somebody
followed me here... home.

1217
01:06:00,139 --> 01:06:02,600
He's outside right now.

1218
01:06:02,641 --> 01:06:06,311
Can you come over or...?

1219
01:06:06,353 --> 01:06:09,439
Just call me back, okay?
All right.

1220
01:06:24,703 --> 01:06:27,164
(intercom buzzing)

1221
01:06:34,837 --> 01:06:36,839
(cocks gun)

1222
01:06:39,592 --> 01:06:41,969
Don't move.

1223
01:06:54,856 --> 01:06:57,859
- Come on, open up.
- Turk?

1224
01:07:03,113 --> 01:07:05,282
I just called you.

1225
01:07:05,324 --> 01:07:06,909
Put the gun down.

1226
01:07:06,950 --> 01:07:08,952
There's a car following me.

1227
01:07:08,994 --> 01:07:11,746
Put the gun down.
Put the gun down.

1228
01:07:15,667 --> 01:07:17,168
Have you got
something to tell me?

1229
01:07:17,210 --> 01:07:19,003
About what?

1230
01:07:19,045 --> 01:07:21,589
Trager, Randall.

1231
01:07:21,630 --> 01:07:23,632
Did you sneak
into my apartment?

1232
01:07:23,674 --> 01:07:25,676
What are they doing
on your computer?

1233
01:07:25,717 --> 01:07:27,928
I was checking
all the links in the case.

1234
01:07:31,264 --> 01:07:32,974
Are you hiding something
from me?

1235
01:07:36,227 --> 01:07:37,770
Huh?

1236
01:07:39,272 --> 01:07:42,149
I just received this... this poem.

1237
01:07:42,191 --> 01:07:44,777
A poem?
Not worth mentioning, huh?

1238
01:07:44,818 --> 01:07:47,362
The handwriting
doesn't even match.

1239
01:07:47,404 --> 01:07:49,573
It's a fake.

1240
01:07:49,614 --> 01:07:51,616
Did you write it?

1241
01:07:53,451 --> 01:07:56,037
Did you write it?

1242
01:08:00,249 --> 01:08:02,793
What the hell is going on here?

1243
01:08:02,835 --> 01:08:05,003
You're spending a lot of time
with Perez, aren't you?

1244
01:08:05,045 --> 01:08:06,922
Yeah, I've been working the case.

1245
01:08:06,964 --> 01:08:09,091
What, are you jealous?

1246
01:08:09,132 --> 01:08:11,926
Can I trust you?

1247
01:08:14,053 --> 01:08:16,806
- Yes.
- Okay.

1248
01:08:16,806 --> 01:08:19,267
Get me anything and everything
that you can find out

1249
01:08:19,308 --> 01:08:21,727
about Perez or Riley,
what they know about me.

1250
01:08:23,479 --> 01:08:25,314
Everything.

1251
01:08:25,355 --> 01:08:27,816
Karen, don't play me.

1252
01:08:29,067 --> 01:08:32,737
Hingis: I am leaning much further
into saying that it is a cop.

1253
01:08:32,779 --> 01:08:36,115
Perez: Tell you what... I'm moving
past the leaning stage

1254
01:08:36,157 --> 01:08:38,951
and I'm moving towards the
l-know-for-sure-it's-a-fucking-cop stage,

1255
01:08:38,993 --> 01:08:41,328
considering how expertly
he shot the shit out of my house.

1256
01:08:41,370 --> 01:08:43,622
Hingis: Oh my God.
Are you hurt?

1257
01:08:43,664 --> 01:08:45,749
Am I hurt? Am I hurt?
He wants to know if I'm hurt.

1258
01:08:45,791 --> 01:08:47,334
Actually, he's dead.

1259
01:08:47,334 --> 01:08:50,003
(sirens wailing)

1260
01:08:50,045 --> 01:08:53,339
- Rooster: His name is Magulat.
- Turk: The guy we saw at Salerno's.

1261
01:08:53,381 --> 01:08:56,467
Yeah, he's in intensive care
at St. Luke's.

1262
01:08:56,509 --> 01:08:58,511
They think he's the guy

1263
01:08:58,553 --> 01:09:01,013
- chopped off Yakov Pearlstein's head.
- What do you think?

1264
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:03,265
You think he's a victim,
or could he be our suspect?

1265
01:09:03,307 --> 01:09:06,351
I don't know, but either way
I think it's gonna be fun.

1266
01:09:07,394 --> 01:09:10,272
Doctor, what's the story?

1267
01:09:10,313 --> 01:09:13,316
He's one of the toughest human beings
I've ever come into contact with.

1268
01:09:13,358 --> 01:09:15,109
We took six bullets
out of him.

1269
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:17,028
Six? Whoo!

1270
01:09:17,070 --> 01:09:19,822
Three from the night he was wounded,
three from previous shootings.

1271
01:09:19,864 --> 01:09:21,740
The man is a tank.

1272
01:09:21,782 --> 01:09:23,867
Do you mind if I talk to him
a little bit?

1273
01:09:23,909 --> 01:09:26,537
His jaw's wired shut,
but go ahead.

1274
01:09:26,578 --> 01:09:29,456
That's okay. I'll ask the questions.
He can just grunt.

1275
01:09:29,498 --> 01:09:32,417
Hey, Yevgeny.

1276
01:09:32,459 --> 01:09:34,711
(snapping fingers)
Wake up.

1277
01:09:34,752 --> 01:09:39,423
That's it. Wake up,
you big fucking grizzly bear.

1278
01:09:39,465 --> 01:09:41,884
You don't speak Russian?

1279
01:09:41,926 --> 01:09:45,512
Swoboda. Swoboda. Swoboda.

1280
01:09:45,554 --> 01:09:48,056
Ron.

1281
01:09:50,642 --> 01:09:52,811
(moans)

1282
01:09:52,852 --> 01:09:56,105
I'm thinking this Russian killing machine
could be our first eyewitness.

1283
01:09:56,105 --> 01:09:58,816
(beeping more rapidly)

1284
01:09:58,858 --> 01:10:01,735
Wake up, gugumuck.
You can tell us who did this to you.

1285
01:10:05,989 --> 01:10:09,409
- (grunting)
- Detective, I think that's enough.

1286
01:10:09,451 --> 01:10:12,912
Then you could tell us where you put
Yakov Pearlstein's head.

1287
01:10:14,289 --> 01:10:16,249
(laughs)

1288
01:10:16,332 --> 01:10:19,210
4-3, 4-3, I need a round-the-clock
security detail

1289
01:10:19,252 --> 01:10:23,505
on a patient Magulat,
M-A-gulat,

1290
01:10:23,547 --> 01:10:25,757
St. Luke's in the ICU.

1291
01:10:27,592 --> 01:10:31,471
#I wake up in the morning... #

1292
01:10:31,513 --> 01:10:34,766
Is this the number to call
to report a case of police brutality?

1293
01:10:34,807 --> 01:10:38,269
- Cat got your tongue?
- Out on bail again?

1294
01:10:38,311 --> 01:10:40,563
What, you think you can scare me,
little bitch? What do you want?

1295
01:10:40,604 --> 01:10:42,940
Be careful, detective.
My taxes pay your salary.

1296
01:10:42,982 --> 01:10:45,567
You don't pay any fucking taxes,
you lowlife piece of shit.

1297
01:10:45,609 --> 01:10:47,986
- Get to the point, come on.
- One of your vics, Trager,

1298
01:10:48,028 --> 01:10:50,655
stole a whole lot of guns
down South.

1299
01:10:50,697 --> 01:10:52,782
Same guns are turning up
on your murder scenes.

1300
01:10:52,824 --> 01:10:54,117
So it's simple...

1301
01:10:54,159 --> 01:10:56,661
find stolen guns,
you got your guy.

1302
01:10:56,703 --> 01:10:58,538
So you know the guy?

1303
01:10:58,579 --> 01:11:01,373
Do you know if there's a cop out there
who might be a danger to the public?

1304
01:11:01,415 --> 01:11:04,168
I couldn't live with myself
if I just stood by and didn't say anything.

1305
01:11:04,209 --> 01:11:07,212
Look, I'm gonna give you
two seconds more. Give me yes or no.

1306
01:11:07,254 --> 01:11:10,215
Do you know the guy?
And when do I meet you to talk about it?

1307
01:11:10,215 --> 01:11:12,967
Friday, 9:00 PM, at my club.

1308
01:11:13,009 --> 01:11:14,177
I'll be there.

1309
01:11:14,219 --> 01:11:16,220
Man, there's dumb
and there's dumber,

1310
01:11:16,262 --> 01:11:18,723
but this is the motherfucking dumbest
right here, man.

1311
01:11:18,764 --> 01:11:20,933
Easy, son, easy.
It's gonna be easy for you.

1312
01:11:20,975 --> 01:11:24,561
All you gotta do is be bait, that's all.
Be a little sardine for us, all right?

1313
01:11:24,603 --> 01:11:27,272
You help us... we got you covered.
Your club doesn't get hassled

1314
01:11:27,314 --> 01:11:29,858
and you don't have a revolving door
in and out of jail.

1315
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:31,484
Do we have a deal or not?

1316
01:11:31,526 --> 01:11:34,904
Yeah, but your boy come in here
and go Hannibal Lecter on my ass,

1317
01:11:34,946 --> 01:11:37,490
I don't want no Jodie fucking Foster
coming through the door.

1318
01:11:37,532 --> 01:11:39,367
I want the goddamn
Marine Corps, man.

1319
01:11:39,408 --> 01:11:43,037
#Since Color Me Badd was singing
"I wanna sex you up"...#

1320
01:11:46,540 --> 01:11:49,251
(footsteps)

1321
01:11:59,719 --> 01:12:01,720
(heart monitor beeping)

1322
01:12:12,063 --> 01:12:13,565
Evening, detective.

1323
01:12:13,606 --> 01:12:16,818
You want one? It's shit,
but it's better than nothing, right?

1324
01:12:16,818 --> 01:12:20,029
Turk's voice: As soon as I heard
the fucking Russian didn't die

1325
01:12:20,071 --> 01:12:22,323
I knew things would never
be the same.

1326
01:12:22,364 --> 01:12:24,533
I had to change the rules,

1327
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:26,577
the strategy.

1328
01:12:26,618 --> 01:12:30,372
I had to be bold, do something
that could never be undone.

1329
01:12:38,212 --> 01:12:40,506
I went for the unforgivable.

1330
01:13:01,692 --> 01:13:03,694
(Karen grunting)

1331
01:13:07,614 --> 01:13:10,325
No. Please. No.

1332
01:13:12,452 --> 01:13:14,871
(crying)

1333
01:13:32,345 --> 01:13:35,223
Karen over phone: Did you hear
anything I just said?

1334
01:13:36,391 --> 01:13:40,102
How exactly could I be
blowing this out of proportion?

1335
01:13:40,144 --> 01:13:42,313
That psycho just assaulted me.

1336
01:13:42,354 --> 01:13:45,649
I am telling you
he is a classic sociopath.

1337
01:13:45,691 --> 01:13:47,818
Okay okay,
I'll look into it, all right?

1338
01:13:47,859 --> 01:13:49,361
I'll look into it.

1339
01:13:49,402 --> 01:13:51,571
You stay the hell away from here.
Understood?

1340
01:13:51,613 --> 01:13:53,406
Understood?

1341
01:13:55,450 --> 01:13:56,784
Fuck that.

1342
01:14:08,211 --> 01:14:10,505
Man: Check the ball,
check the ball.

1343
01:14:10,547 --> 01:14:11,965
(players chattering)

1344
01:14:12,007 --> 01:14:15,260
I got the ball. I got the ball. I got the ball.
Stay on him. Stay on him.

1345
01:14:15,301 --> 01:14:17,220
Karen: Excuse me,
I'm detective Corelli.

1346
01:14:17,261 --> 01:14:20,181
- I need to see your reservation book.
- Woman: Sure. Help yourself.

1347
01:14:27,646 --> 01:14:29,856
- Thank you.
- Anytime.

1348
01:14:29,898 --> 01:14:31,608
Yes, this is detective Corelli.

1349
01:14:31,650 --> 01:14:34,068
I've been trying to reach
detectives Perez and Riley

1350
01:14:34,110 --> 01:14:36,029
and I can't seem
to locate them.

1351
01:14:36,070 --> 01:14:39,073
- Perez: I like to party.
- That's nothing. I was into Kiss.

1352
01:14:39,115 --> 01:14:41,117
I used to run
around the house

1353
01:14:41,158 --> 01:14:43,285
with my tongue hanging out,
spitting fake blood.

1354
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:44,620
I need to speak to them
urgently.

1355
01:14:44,661 --> 01:14:46,830
(police siren whooping)

1356
01:14:48,457 --> 01:14:51,835
Yes, I understand,
but I need the location, please.

1357
01:15:15,898 --> 01:15:17,191
(buzzes)

1358
01:15:20,403 --> 01:15:22,905
Hey, he's here.

1359
01:15:22,947 --> 01:15:24,156
Turk: Let me in.

1360
01:15:29,619 --> 01:15:29,703
Thank God it's the police.

1361
01:15:29,703 --> 01:15:31,913
Thank God it's the police.

1362
01:15:31,955 --> 01:15:34,290
Yeah, so where do we go?

1363
01:15:34,332 --> 01:15:36,250
Follow me.

1364
01:15:36,292 --> 01:15:38,586
I used to play ball
a couple of blocks from here.

1365
01:15:38,628 --> 01:15:39,879
Get the fuck out of here.

1366
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:42,840
When I was a kid I wasn't afraid
to mix it up with guys like you.

1367
01:15:42,881 --> 01:15:44,174
You still ain't.

1368
01:15:44,216 --> 01:15:46,718
Yeah, nowadays
I carry a gun with me.

1369
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:50,055
It's a bad neighborhood.

1370
01:15:50,096 --> 01:15:52,057
- It ain't bad for me.
- Yeah, well...

1371
01:15:52,098 --> 01:15:54,517
Yeah, he's inside.

1372
01:15:54,559 --> 01:15:56,102
Well, so far so good.

1373
01:15:56,144 --> 01:15:58,729
So now that we're done with
the pleasantries, what do you got for me?

1374
01:15:58,771 --> 01:16:00,022
Rooster: He's talking.

1375
01:16:00,064 --> 01:16:02,066
- What did you think he was gonna do?
- Spider: How about an apology?

1376
01:16:02,107 --> 01:16:04,860
Spider: The shit that happened to Stubby,
that wasn't supposed to happen.

1377
01:16:04,902 --> 01:16:08,405
- Rooster: Lieutenant, that's a crock of shit.
- I lost three fucking teeth that day.

1378
01:16:08,447 --> 01:16:10,740
He's not a civilian.
He's a fucking dealer.

1379
01:16:10,782 --> 01:16:12,826
- And I kept my mouth shut.
- So what?

1380
01:16:12,867 --> 01:16:16,162
You guys love those stupid gold teeth.
You should thank me.

1381
01:16:16,204 --> 01:16:19,040
Well, he's wearing a vest
and Starsky and Hutch here

1382
01:16:19,081 --> 01:16:22,084
are watching him like a couple
of hawks... gay hawks.

1383
01:16:22,126 --> 01:16:25,295
- Yeah, right there, buddy.
- (chuckles)

1384
01:16:25,337 --> 01:16:28,298
All right, enough bullshit.
So you know our poetry boy?

1385
01:16:28,340 --> 01:16:30,342
Just talk to me.
What do you got for me?

1386
01:16:30,383 --> 01:16:32,427
- All right, here we go.
- Here we go.

1387
01:16:32,469 --> 01:16:33,970
Would you please?

1388
01:16:33,970 --> 01:16:36,806
Just 'cause the guy's talking tough,
that don't mean shit.

1389
01:16:36,848 --> 01:16:38,641
Let me ask you something,
Copernicus.

1390
01:16:38,683 --> 01:16:41,268
That gun on his belt...
do you think it's a service pistol?

1391
01:16:41,310 --> 01:16:43,979
I bet you we'll trace it back to Trager's.
What do you think about that?

1392
01:16:44,021 --> 01:16:45,772
- What do you want to bet?
- 500 bucks.

1393
01:16:45,814 --> 01:16:47,941
- You're on.
- I'm in for another five.

1394
01:16:47,983 --> 01:16:50,318
Oh, this is fun.

1395
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:52,570
Look, I help you,
you reciprocate.

1396
01:16:52,612 --> 01:16:54,072
So help me.

1397
01:16:54,113 --> 01:16:56,407
All right, you might see
a little bit of a cell-phone video.

1398
01:16:56,449 --> 01:16:58,492
I got it in front of Trager's
the night he bought it.

1399
01:16:58,534 --> 01:17:00,494
- You got what?
- I got a movie...

1400
01:17:00,536 --> 01:17:03,998
a couple of kids back from the prom,
preserving their special memories,

1401
01:17:04,039 --> 01:17:05,749
a positive Id of you, big time.

1402
01:17:05,791 --> 01:17:07,959
- Oh, yeah? Of me?
- Yeah.

1403
01:17:08,001 --> 01:17:09,711
Okay.

1404
01:17:09,753 --> 01:17:11,296
Now you know
what I'm talking about.

1405
01:17:11,338 --> 01:17:13,673
Yeah, now I got it.

1406
01:17:13,715 --> 01:17:15,675
Yeah, well,
so how do I look?

1407
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:20,304
Like a poet?

1408
01:17:21,305 --> 01:17:22,973
'Cause that's what I am,
you know, a poet.

1409
01:17:23,015 --> 01:17:25,684
All right, come on, let's go.

1410
01:17:25,726 --> 01:17:28,353
In fact, I wrote a poem for you, Spider.
Want to hear it?

1411
01:17:28,395 --> 01:17:30,355
Eh?

1412
01:17:30,397 --> 01:17:32,607
(cocks gun)

1413
01:17:32,649 --> 01:17:34,192
(door crashes open)

1414
01:17:34,234 --> 01:17:37,695
Drop your gun right now, motherfucker!
Drop to the ground right now!

1415
01:17:37,737 --> 01:17:39,572
Oh! Oh! Grease me up and...

1416
01:17:39,613 --> 01:17:41,699
I mean, do they actually pay
you two morons?

1417
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:44,993
- Put the fucking weapon on the ground.
- Gladly. Gladly. Right there.

1418
01:17:45,035 --> 01:17:46,995
Right there. There you go.

1419
01:17:48,163 --> 01:17:50,081
Hey, you want to read my poem?

1420
01:17:50,081 --> 01:17:51,541
Easy easy.

1421
01:17:51,583 --> 01:17:52,876
Here, read it.

1422
01:17:55,044 --> 01:17:57,296
"You tried to set me up, you fucks,

1423
01:17:57,338 --> 01:17:59,131
And this is how you do it?

1424
01:17:59,173 --> 01:18:01,926
You thought I'd get
my dick cut off,

1425
01:18:01,926 --> 01:18:04,511
Instead you only blew it."

1426
01:18:04,553 --> 01:18:06,555
- (both laugh)
- Great stuff.

1427
01:18:06,597 --> 01:18:08,974
- What is that shit?
- Thank you.

1428
01:18:09,015 --> 01:18:11,434
That is poetry.

1429
01:18:11,476 --> 01:18:13,228
What are you doing here?

1430
01:18:13,269 --> 01:18:15,104
Well, don't look at me, partner,

1431
01:18:15,104 --> 01:18:17,607
but I tagged along
to protect your ass

1432
01:18:17,648 --> 01:18:20,985
and to see the look on their faces.
It was worth it.

1433
01:18:21,026 --> 01:18:23,404
We're doing our jobs here, okay?
I'm not gonna apologize for that.

1434
01:18:23,445 --> 01:18:26,073
I never want you to apologize, Teddy.
There's a killer out there with a badge.

1435
01:18:26,114 --> 01:18:28,283
- What are you morons doing about it?
- What do you think we're doing here?

1436
01:18:28,325 --> 01:18:30,160
- That's not it.
- No, that's not it.

1437
01:18:30,202 --> 01:18:32,120
I just made 1000 bucks.

1438
01:18:32,162 --> 01:18:33,997
Where's the other gun?
Give it to me.

1439
01:18:34,038 --> 01:18:35,832
Why don't you frisk me, Sherlock?
Go ahead.

1440
01:18:35,873 --> 01:18:38,084
- Frisk me, go ahead. Go ahead.
- Yeah, I'm gonna frisk you.

1441
01:18:41,170 --> 01:18:43,797
Ooh, nice touch, Mary.

1442
01:18:43,839 --> 01:18:46,008
What are you doing after work?
Unless you're committed.

1443
01:18:46,049 --> 01:18:48,301
I don't want to get
in the middle of anything.

1444
01:18:48,343 --> 01:18:51,554
What happened to your face?
Your mick friend give you a little love bite?

1445
01:18:51,596 --> 01:18:54,974
- Shut the fuck up. Shut your fucking face.
- Hey hey hey! Whoa!

1446
01:18:55,016 --> 01:18:57,727
I'll blow your brains out
if you don't get the fuck away.

1447
01:18:57,768 --> 01:18:59,937
- What's he talking about?
- (all yelling)

1448
01:18:59,979 --> 01:19:01,772
- What's he talking about?
- What he's talking about is,

1449
01:19:01,814 --> 01:19:04,149
just 'cause you didn't go for this
doesn't mean you're not our guy.

1450
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:06,526
- Now we gotta break this shit up.
- Don't translate for me, man.

1451
01:19:06,568 --> 01:19:09,196
Rooster: Will you let this go?
You fucked up, okay?

1452
01:19:09,237 --> 01:19:11,781
- We fucked up 'cause you helped him.
- I'm gonna nail your ass.

1453
01:19:11,823 --> 01:19:14,200
I'm not through with you, man.
Make a mistake.

1454
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:16,202
Rooster: I'm gonna
break this stuff down, okay?

1455
01:19:16,244 --> 01:19:18,496
You fucking dog.

1456
01:19:20,039 --> 01:19:22,791
Relax, Spider.

1457
01:19:22,833 --> 01:19:25,169
Come on, let's have a drink.

1458
01:19:25,210 --> 01:19:28,755
I saw what I think
is a refrigerator here.

1459
01:19:32,967 --> 01:19:34,636
I'll be back in a second.

1460
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:45,062
Hey, muffinhead.

1461
01:19:48,273 --> 01:19:49,733
Is this the person
who shot you?

1462
01:19:50,734 --> 01:19:52,694
You're sure?

1463
01:19:56,406 --> 01:19:58,366
(chuckles)

1464
01:19:58,407 --> 01:20:00,451
No, you're the pumpkinhead.

1465
01:20:05,789 --> 01:20:07,791
(Spider chuckling)

1466
01:20:11,711 --> 01:20:13,671
You miss me?

1467
01:20:15,715 --> 01:20:18,050
"...of death and pain,

1468
01:20:18,092 --> 01:20:20,261
Place oneself among the slain.

1469
01:20:20,302 --> 01:20:22,805
If one addiction goes unfed,

1470
01:20:22,846 --> 01:20:25,140
The world is better with him dead."

1471
01:20:43,741 --> 01:20:44,950
Take it easy.

1472
01:20:44,992 --> 01:20:46,785
It's okay.
It's gonna be all right.

1473
01:20:46,827 --> 01:20:49,037
Jesus Christ, Rooster.

1474
01:20:49,079 --> 01:20:51,956
Just move into the room. Here.

1475
01:20:51,998 --> 01:20:54,459
Sit down. Sit down.

1476
01:20:57,336 --> 01:20:59,338
Okay.

1477
01:20:59,380 --> 01:21:03,092
You gotta know about this,
Tom, from me.

1478
01:21:03,133 --> 01:21:06,220
Now just open that little book,
start reading.

1479
01:21:06,261 --> 01:21:08,722
Everything you want to know
is in there.

1480
01:21:10,765 --> 01:21:12,767
So go ahead.

1481
01:21:14,352 --> 01:21:16,312
Out loud.

1482
01:21:17,688 --> 01:21:19,774
For the record.

1483
01:21:19,815 --> 01:21:22,568
See the little video here?

1484
01:21:28,990 --> 01:21:32,369
"My name is david Fisk,
detective First Grade.

1485
01:21:32,369 --> 01:21:36,456
I've been a cop in the NYPd
for nearly 30 years."

1486
01:21:37,540 --> 01:21:41,085
- Dave, dave, dave, dave.
- Tom,

1487
01:21:41,127 --> 01:21:44,213
we've got a lot to cover
and not much time to do it in, so...

1488
01:21:47,507 --> 01:21:50,719
"My name is david Fisk,
detective First Grade."

1489
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:53,263
My name is david Fisk.

1490
01:21:53,304 --> 01:21:56,349
"I've been a cop in the NYPd
for nearly 30 years."

1491
01:21:56,391 --> 01:21:59,226
I don't expect you
to remember me.

1492
01:21:59,268 --> 01:22:01,312
I mean, it's been a long time

1493
01:22:01,353 --> 01:22:05,149
since you sat me on your lap
and told me you loved me.

1494
01:22:05,190 --> 01:22:08,235
"In that time

1495
01:22:08,276 --> 01:22:11,029
I've killed 14 people."

1496
01:22:12,113 --> 01:22:14,115
Rooster: But I guarantee

1497
01:22:14,157 --> 01:22:17,326
you're gonna remember the name
for the rest of your life.

1498
01:22:27,836 --> 01:22:31,423
"You don't become a cop
because you want to serve and protect.

1499
01:22:32,882 --> 01:22:35,927
You join the force because they let you
carry a gun and a badge.

1500
01:22:35,968 --> 01:22:38,638
Most people respect the badge.

1501
01:22:38,679 --> 01:22:40,765
Everybody respects the gun."

1502
01:22:40,806 --> 01:22:43,642
I'm the killer.
I show up at your door.

1503
01:22:43,684 --> 01:22:46,520
Turk: What are you talking about?
It's not a fucking chess game.

1504
01:22:46,562 --> 01:22:49,648
Who knows? Maybe it is.
You're making all the wrong moves.

1505
01:22:49,689 --> 01:22:51,900
I'm gonna put two
through his fucking head

1506
01:22:51,941 --> 01:22:54,277
myself.

1507
01:22:54,319 --> 01:22:56,446
I know it to a moral certainty.

1508
01:22:56,487 --> 01:22:59,031
You sort of get numb to it.

1509
01:23:08,582 --> 01:23:11,334
"Tom Cowen was my role model.

1510
01:23:21,385 --> 01:23:23,679
The day I stopped trying to be him

1511
01:23:23,721 --> 01:23:26,056
was the greatest day of my life.

1512
01:23:30,101 --> 01:23:33,396
Several years back I framed
a lowlife child killer

1513
01:23:33,438 --> 01:23:36,107
named Charles Randall.

1514
01:23:37,900 --> 01:23:40,277
I should have known
it would come back to haunt me."

1515
01:23:44,490 --> 01:23:46,867
What do you want me
to do with this?

1516
01:23:48,660 --> 01:23:51,079
Is that all you got to say?

1517
01:23:51,121 --> 01:23:53,373
I owe you this explanation, pal.

1518
01:23:53,414 --> 01:23:55,416
Why are you telling me now?

1519
01:23:55,458 --> 01:23:59,795
Lvan the Terrible
is gonna wake up pretty soon

1520
01:23:59,837 --> 01:24:01,630
and he's gonna Id me.

1521
01:24:07,219 --> 01:24:09,054
Evening, detective.

1522
01:24:09,096 --> 01:24:12,057
You want one? It's shit,
but it's better than nothing, right?

1523
01:24:12,098 --> 01:24:16,227
I can just walk right in here.
Your partner's asleep. Step outside.

1524
01:24:16,269 --> 01:24:19,105
Did I ever pick
the wrong fucking Russki to shoot?

1525
01:24:28,488 --> 01:24:30,907
Now we're going off the record.

1526
01:24:33,451 --> 01:24:37,246
Uh, I'm going to take the rap
for the Randall gun thing.

1527
01:24:37,288 --> 01:24:39,123
You saw that.

1528
01:24:39,123 --> 01:24:42,293
I mean, considering
the circumstances, why not?

1529
01:24:42,334 --> 01:24:44,795
No need to thank me.

1530
01:24:46,004 --> 01:24:47,964
That business about not being me...

1531
01:24:47,964 --> 01:24:49,466
Yeah.

1532
01:24:49,508 --> 01:24:51,468
I don't get that.

1533
01:24:51,509 --> 01:24:55,513
Well, you're a great cop, Tom.

1534
01:24:55,555 --> 01:24:57,557
I mean, you were the one

1535
01:24:57,598 --> 01:25:00,643
I aspired to all my life
and could never be.

1536
01:25:02,228 --> 01:25:04,646
Then you broke the law,

1537
01:25:04,646 --> 01:25:07,816
planted the gun on Randall,

1538
01:25:07,858 --> 01:25:11,152
let me down.

1539
01:25:12,862 --> 01:25:14,822
I lost my faith.

1540
01:25:16,366 --> 01:25:20,327
That's when it all started.

1541
01:25:20,369 --> 01:25:23,038
And once it did,

1542
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:25,124
I couldn't stop.

1543
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:30,170
Finally,

1544
01:25:30,212 --> 01:25:32,714
I didn't want to.

1545
01:25:39,136 --> 01:25:42,681
So I did my own thing.

1546
01:25:42,723 --> 01:25:45,350
And you know what? In the end

1547
01:25:45,392 --> 01:25:47,686
it got done.

1548
01:25:47,728 --> 01:25:50,230
The scum went down.

1549
01:25:50,272 --> 01:25:52,148
And that's it. That's that.

1550
01:25:53,691 --> 01:25:55,985
I don't understand
a word you said,

1551
01:25:56,027 --> 01:25:58,196
- don't understand any of it.
- I know you don't, Tom.

1552
01:25:58,237 --> 01:26:00,906
As soon as I heard
the Russian didn't die

1553
01:26:00,948 --> 01:26:03,325
I knew I had to change the rules,

1554
01:26:03,367 --> 01:26:06,203
do something that could
never be undone.

1555
01:26:06,245 --> 01:26:08,288
I went for the unforgivable.

1556
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,543
No.

1557
01:26:15,003 --> 01:26:17,255
So what am I gonna do, my friend,

1558
01:26:17,296 --> 01:26:19,924
partner? Arrest you?

1559
01:26:19,965 --> 01:26:22,843
At some point I gotta call it in.

1560
01:26:22,885 --> 01:26:24,261
We're a team.

1561
01:26:24,303 --> 01:26:26,013
We were.

1562
01:26:26,054 --> 01:26:28,056
Yeah, we were, a great team.

1563
01:26:28,098 --> 01:26:30,559
That was yesterday, dave.

1564
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:31,726
Today...

1565
01:26:33,853 --> 01:26:36,814
today you're pointing a gun at me.

1566
01:26:41,277 --> 01:26:44,405
(cocks gun)
But it hasn't gone off yet.

1567
01:26:49,784 --> 01:26:51,244
Bye, Tom.

1568
01:26:51,286 --> 01:26:53,413
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.

1569
01:26:53,455 --> 01:26:56,457
To hell, I suppose.

1570
01:27:43,125 --> 01:27:45,169
- Hey, dave, dave.
- Whoa.

1571
01:27:45,210 --> 01:27:47,754
Don't come closer!

1572
01:27:47,796 --> 01:27:50,131
- You wouldn't.
- You want to bet your life on it?

1573
01:27:50,173 --> 01:27:52,133
Come on, partner, I know you.
You wouldn't.

1574
01:27:52,175 --> 01:27:54,552
(Karen cocks gun)
But I would.

1575
01:27:54,552 --> 01:27:55,803
Oh.

1576
01:27:55,845 --> 01:27:57,847
Karen, just take it easy.

1577
01:27:57,889 --> 01:27:59,890
- Can't get me out of your mind?
- Shut up, dave.

1578
01:27:59,932 --> 01:28:03,977
You're gonna defend
this lowlife piece of shit?

1579
01:28:04,019 --> 01:28:06,939
- Boy, I'm in your head.
- I'm not defending him. Take it easy.

1580
01:28:06,980 --> 01:28:10,150
Fuck you, Turk.
Put the gun down, Fisk.

1581
01:28:10,192 --> 01:28:11,651
- And if I don't?
- Dave.

1582
01:28:11,693 --> 01:28:14,445
- How about I blow your brains out?
- Ooh, I like the sound of that.

1583
01:28:14,487 --> 01:28:16,406
- Don't move.
- Karen.

1584
01:28:16,447 --> 01:28:18,866
You blow me away, Turk dies.
Is that your idea?

1585
01:28:18,908 --> 01:28:20,242
I said don't move, you prick.

1586
01:28:20,242 --> 01:28:22,578
Bye-bye!

1587
01:28:24,246 --> 01:28:25,831
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun.

1588
01:28:27,499 --> 01:28:29,209
Stay here.

1589
01:28:35,965 --> 01:28:37,383
Oh, man.

1590
01:28:38,718 --> 01:28:39,969
Fuck.

1591
01:28:41,512 --> 01:28:43,430
- (train passing)
- These old locks...

1592
01:28:43,472 --> 01:28:45,140
I mean, they're good.

1593
01:28:45,182 --> 01:28:47,142
Dave, you've got to end
this thing.

1594
01:28:47,184 --> 01:28:49,227
End it?

1595
01:28:49,311 --> 01:28:50,604
Put the gun down.

1596
01:28:50,645 --> 01:28:53,439
What's your plan?

1597
01:28:53,481 --> 01:28:55,775
Are you gonna arrest me?

1598
01:28:55,817 --> 01:28:58,611
Are you gonna take me down
to the precinct, book me,

1599
01:28:58,653 --> 01:29:02,323
fingerprint me,
body-cavity-search me?

1600
01:29:02,364 --> 01:29:04,241
What the fuck
are you gonna do?

1601
01:29:04,283 --> 01:29:07,202
Wheel me out on the "Geraldo" show,
a freak of the week?

1602
01:29:07,244 --> 01:29:11,956
Or better yet, an in-depth
psycho profile on "Oprah"?

1603
01:29:11,998 --> 01:29:14,292
Are you ready for that?
It ain't gonna fly, man.

1604
01:29:14,334 --> 01:29:16,669
Dave, you give me no choice.

1605
01:29:16,711 --> 01:29:18,546
You got a choice... I escape.

1606
01:29:20,131 --> 01:29:22,383
Would you do that for me, Tom?

1607
01:29:23,509 --> 01:29:24,718
Would you let me escape?

1608
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:26,303
Come on, don't do this.

1609
01:29:26,345 --> 01:29:28,680
I'm gonna make a run for it.

1610
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:30,890
What do you think?

1611
01:29:30,932 --> 01:29:33,935
You gotta do the right thing.

1612
01:29:39,940 --> 01:29:41,984
That's a 10-10, partner...

1613
01:29:42,026 --> 01:29:45,404
shots fired, suspect fleeing.
Let's go!

1614
01:29:45,445 --> 01:29:47,072
Come on, don't go there.

1615
01:29:48,573 --> 01:29:51,660
Hey, partner, come on.
Shots fired.

1616
01:29:51,701 --> 01:29:54,120
- Don't do this.
- Suspect fleeing,

1617
01:29:54,162 --> 01:29:56,581
resisting arrest. Come on.

1618
01:30:06,006 --> 01:30:08,884
A righteous man

1619
01:30:08,925 --> 01:30:11,678
Before me stands,

1620
01:30:11,720 --> 01:30:16,057
A hero in these filthy lands.

1621
01:30:16,099 --> 01:30:19,518
A brother in arms,

1622
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:23,022
In heart are you.

1623
01:30:23,063 --> 01:30:25,732
I was really hoping

1624
01:30:25,774 --> 01:30:28,402
You'd get it too.

1625
01:30:31,905 --> 01:30:34,449
- I do get it.
- No, you don't.

1626
01:30:34,490 --> 01:30:36,451
No, I get it.

1627
01:30:42,790 --> 01:30:46,043
You know, the only thing
in this life

1628
01:30:46,084 --> 01:30:48,920
that ever gave me
any satisfaction

1629
01:30:48,962 --> 01:30:50,839
was killing those fucks.

1630
01:30:52,799 --> 01:30:55,093
So this is for real.

1631
01:30:55,134 --> 01:30:57,512
I mean,

1632
01:30:57,553 --> 01:30:59,889
this one is bad.

1633
01:31:02,057 --> 01:31:03,684
10-13.

1634
01:31:04,685 --> 01:31:06,895
Officer down.

1635
01:31:06,937 --> 01:31:09,814
(train passing)

1636
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:33,586
I ain't going anywhere, Tom.

1637
01:31:33,628 --> 01:31:35,922
I ain't going anywhere.

1638
01:31:37,048 --> 01:31:39,884
It's okay.

1639
01:31:45,180 --> 01:31:47,933
3-4 squad, Central.
3-4 squad, Central.

1640
01:31:47,974 --> 01:31:50,477
10-13, officer down.
184th and St. Nick's.

1641
01:31:50,518 --> 01:31:53,229
Officer down, 10-13.
Hurry hurry hurry.

1642
01:31:53,271 --> 01:31:55,940
- Dispatcher: 10-4, 4 squad...
- Tom, don't. Don't.

1643
01:31:55,982 --> 01:31:59,527
- Officer down. ETA six minutes.
- Don't.

1644
01:31:59,568 --> 01:32:02,196
Don't.

1645
01:32:14,415 --> 01:32:16,459
Don't.

1646
01:32:24,925 --> 01:32:27,010
3-4 squad, Central.

1647
01:32:27,052 --> 01:32:29,638
Dispatcher: Central.
Go ahead, 4 squad.

1648
01:32:29,679 --> 01:32:32,223
That's a 10-55 on the bus.
Cancel the ambulance.

1649
01:32:32,265 --> 01:32:34,225
Dispatcher: 10-5?

1650
01:32:34,267 --> 01:32:37,353
Turk: Cancel the ambulance.
10-55 on the bus. Cancel the ambulance.

1651
01:32:37,395 --> 01:32:40,064
- You sure on that?
- Sure on that.

1652
01:32:49,197 --> 01:32:51,574
You did this, you know.

1653
01:32:53,118 --> 01:32:56,579
I know, partner, I know.

1654
01:32:59,749 --> 01:33:01,584
We did good, Tom.

1655
01:33:02,793 --> 01:33:05,254
Tom, Tommy.

1656
01:33:05,295 --> 01:33:09,007
We did good. We did good.

1657
01:33:10,717 --> 01:33:13,470
You're a good man, Tom.

1658
01:33:13,470 --> 01:33:15,930
You're a good man.

1659
01:33:17,306 --> 01:33:20,309
I wish you...

1660
01:33:20,351 --> 01:33:22,645
I wish you

1661
01:33:22,686 --> 01:33:25,772
continued success.

1662
01:34:07,519 --> 01:34:09,688
Some piece of work, your partner.

1663
01:34:09,729 --> 01:34:11,690
Lights.

1664
01:34:11,731 --> 01:34:13,525
Look, Cowen,

1665
01:34:13,566 --> 01:34:16,235
the way we see it,

1666
01:34:16,277 --> 01:34:19,238
detective Fisk just closed the door
on the poetry boy.

1667
01:34:26,203 --> 01:34:29,372
Good. Whatever you say.

1668
01:34:32,208 --> 01:34:34,669
Are we done?

1669
01:34:34,711 --> 01:34:36,712
Yeah, we're done.

1670
01:34:42,593 --> 01:34:44,720
(children playing)

1671
01:34:58,816 --> 01:35:00,651
Turk's voice: My daughter called.

1672
01:35:00,693 --> 01:35:04,363
She was upset about Rooster
and worried about me.

1673
01:35:04,405 --> 01:35:07,949
She asked me if I was likely
to do something stupid

1674
01:35:07,991 --> 01:35:10,577
and I said, "Like what,

1675
01:35:10,619 --> 01:35:13,621
take anger management classes
or retire?"

1676
01:35:13,663 --> 01:35:16,958
I said I was gonna do
the same old thing I always do.

1677
01:35:16,958 --> 01:35:20,878
She said, "Good.
What else could you do?"

1678
01:35:20,920 --> 01:35:22,588
I said, "Right."

1679
01:35:22,630 --> 01:35:25,632
A real chip off the old block,
my daughter.

1680
01:35:25,674 --> 01:35:28,927
She said I was a cop
and a good one.

1681
01:35:28,969 --> 01:35:32,514
Funny... Rooster said
the same thing.

1682
01:35:35,641 --> 01:35:38,894
Turk: Okay, guys,
let's get ready to play ball.

1683
01:35:38,936 --> 01:35:42,773
On the count of three.
Everybody in?

1684
01:35:42,815 --> 01:35:46,360
One, two, three, explosion!

1685
01:35:59,038 --> 01:35:59,246
(instrumental music playing)

1686
01:35:59,246 --> 01:36:01,040
(instrumental music playing)
