1
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:23,346
One

2
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:24,816
between the eyes!

3
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:26,978
Two

4
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,113
between the eyes.

5
00:01:58,084 --> 00:01:59,881
- Out!
- What?

6
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,223
- She was safe.
- She was out.

7
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:07,192
She landed right there.
She's safe.

8
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:11,490
Aw, come on.

9
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:14,193
That's enough.
I don't want to hear another word.

10
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:16,498
- You're gone!
- Yeah, I'm gone.

11
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:27,007
My grandmother used to take
me to Washington Square Park...

12
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:31,350
to watch Bobby Fischer
play 10 games at the same time.

13
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:33,443
Queen me.

14
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,421
He was five-six moves ahead
on each table.

15
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:39,914
Anyway, he became
the world champ, didn't he?

16
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,984
Then he lost his fucking mind.

17
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:47,960
He became a raving paranoid.

18
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,730
Being attacked
from all directions,

19
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:51,794
he couldn't see
what was in front of him.

20
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:01,107
Mate. Mate!

21
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:34,002
My name is David Fisk,

22
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,208
Detective First Grade.

23
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:40,284
I've been a cop in the NYPD
for over 30 years.

24
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:43,953
In that time...

25
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:48,026
I've killed 14 people.

26
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:51,920
Run that by me
one more time.

27
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:55,492
I've killed 14 people.

28
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:57,196
He's nuts.

29
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:01,902
When did
these things start?

30
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:08,173
How did they start?

31
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:16,551
Maybe this one started
with a guy named Charles Randall.

32
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:25,096
Randall was a child killer.

33
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:29,232
He killed his girlfriend's daughter

34
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,703
about four years ago.

35
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:35,064
Fuck you, damn asshole.

36
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:37,969
He was tried
for the crime,

37
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:40,479
but was acquitted
by a jury of his peers.

38
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:58,122
My partner and I
found this unacceptable.

39
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:04,870
My partner is a good man.

40
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:28,486
Are you really
gonna do this thing?

41
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:30,553
Do what?

42
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:33,030
You're going to
take down Randall

43
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,227
for a homicide
he didn't commit.

44
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:42,438
What am I gonna do?

45
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:44,466
You're my partner.

46
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,910
- You're my role model.
- Right.

47
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:48,937
What am I gonna do
without a role model?

48
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,150
We didn't have
this conversation.

49
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,679
What conversation?

50
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:18,572
It got done.

51
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:25,909
Randall lost his freedom

52
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:27,920
for the crime he didn't commit.

53
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:35,852
I lost my faith.

54
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:41,056
- I'm gonna go.
- Okay.

55
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:54,112
You can take this
as a confession if you want.

56
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:56,138
Whatever.

57
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:58,980
A few weeks ago
things heated up.

58
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:00,781
What do we got on him, Turk?

59
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:05,223
Marcus Smith, AKA Spider...
big big dope deals,

60
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,692
murders, extortion,
lots of nice things.

61
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:10,059
He converted
this old abandoned bank

62
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,223
into Club 404 of Harlem.

63
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,892
Maybe when he sees us
he'll confess.

64
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,901
What, you don't believe
in miracles?

65
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,527
When you pick up a check
one day...

66
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,902
one day,
then I'll believe in miracles.

67
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:23,067
- Let's go. I'm buying.
- Yeah, that's a miracle I want to see.

68
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:29,740
#We fly high, no lie #

69
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:32,751
# You hear that?
You know this, balling #

70
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,754
# Foreign rides outside #

71
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,847
# It's like showbiz,
we in the building #

72
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,085
# We stay fly, no lie... #

73
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,889
This is where he launders
his money.

74
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:45,887
Oh, yeah,
cleaning green green green.

75
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:48,127
He's all business.

76
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:51,366
I gotta take a leak.

77
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:03,274
Oh, I'll just be a sec.

78
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,783
I'm not peeking.

79
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,217
No problem.

80
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:14,282
- You guys are so lucky.
- Why is that?

81
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,625
No line to the bathroom and...

82
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:20,794
you get to pee standing up.

83
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,664
Unzip, psss, zip.

84
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:24,966
Badda boom badda bing,
you're out of here.

85
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:29,407
Yeah, the big guy really outdid himself
on this thing.

86
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:30,807
You want a bump?

87
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,777
Where did you get that from?

88
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:35,246
Spider. Supremo.

89
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:45,674
Not bad.

90
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:48,983
Not bad?
What the fuck were you looking for?

91
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:51,421
Come on, Turk,

92
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:53,448
you pulled my hair.

93
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:56,689
Gee, my little sister used to
pull my hair harder than that.

94
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:57,923
Whatever.

95
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,194
I gotta go.

96
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:17,646
- Where the fuck are you going?
- I'm tired.

97
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:20,345
You're tired?
It's America, you whiny bitch.

98
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:23,219
Why don't you fucking get in the cab
and do some honest work?

99
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:26,122
Yeah, she's on her way.
She can't wait to see you.

100
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:29,423
Rambo the Skateboard Pimp
was my 10th kill.

101
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:35,261
Think of me as a street-sweeper.

102
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,394
I cleaned up this worthless
piece of shit

103
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:40,462
and left an obituary of sorts.
It rhymes.

104
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:51,714
Rooster, we gotta find out
who did this.

105
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,616
Give him a medal.

106
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,486
Hey, Rambo, you see
who did this?

107
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:58,490
He ain't talking, eh?

108
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:00,719
Real name Robert Brady.

109
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,751
Bobby Brady. Damn shame.

110
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:04,626
What are you thinking?
Marcia? Greg?

111
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:08,123
You guys messing up
my crime scene again?

112
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,294
You don't know
who Bobby Brady is?

113
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,327
Yeah, we met about an hour ago.

114
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:15,135
- It looks like close range.
- From the stippling around the wound

115
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,801
I'd say two to three feet away.

116
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:19,572
We'll be fishing fragments
out of his brains.

117
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:21,671
- What?
- No, I just got that...

118
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:23,807
"Marcia? Greg?"
That's a good one, Rooster.

119
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,578
Well, that was quick.

120
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,449
Just trying to keep pace with you.

121
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:34,752
"He trades in sin,
distributes flesh.

122
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:37,160
He picks the fruit
when it is fresh.

123
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:40,324
Now someone else
must slap his whore.

124
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:45,099
His heart has stopped.
He breathes no more."

125
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:48,997
What do you want to do
about this?

126
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,839
I say let's make the best of it,

127
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:55,005
canvass the hookers.
Maybe we'll meet one you like.

128
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:58,676
Please. I got all I can handle
from you-know-who.

129
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,515
No shit?

130
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,647
She's got my sperm level so low
I gotta sit down to take a piss.

131
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:05,350
Oh, thanks for that picture.

132
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,655
Hey, what can I tell you?

133
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:10,457
How can I help you, gentlemen?

134
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:12,521
We'd like to talk to you
about your boss.

135
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,829
He's upstairs.

136
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:17,199
No, your other boss.

137
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:22,997
Rambo.

138
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:24,976
He is asshole.

139
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:28,173
Why "he is asshole"?

140
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:30,614
Follow me, please.

141
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:37,014
You know anybody
who'd want to kill him?

142
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:38,717
Me.

143
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,055
Anyone else?

144
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,083
Why? He's dead?

145
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:46,354
Hey, listen, you want to smarten up
and help us out

146
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:48,093
or am I gonna have to call
somebody at ICE

147
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:49,897
and have you on the next plane
to kielbasa-land?

148
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,766
Go ahead.

149
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:53,704
I am American citizen.

150
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:55,798
Yeah.

151
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:57,900
Lick my balls anytime.

152
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,535
What?

153
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:01,569
Call us anytime, you know,

154
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,014
if you hear something, anything.

155
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:09,218
I think we're looking
for a guy named Sam the Butcher.

156
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:11,723
Who?

157
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:14,021
Nah, he's kidding around.
But seriously, Lieutenant,

158
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:16,084
how far do you want us to go
with this Rambo murder?

159
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,596
I don't know, I was thinking maybe
you could investigate it a bit more,

160
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,031
figure out who did it,
try to put him in jail.

161
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:23,933
That is, if it doesn't get in the way
of your shuffleboard lessons.

162
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,493
Yeah, no problem.

163
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:28,405
We're also working this dealer Spider
who's tied to these two stiffs

164
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,737
we found on Fresh Kills.

165
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:35,946
If we can nail him, who knows
how far up the ladder it will lead?

166
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,107
So what about it?

167
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,844
I popped this lawyer
with an ounce of blow.

168
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:41,250
She practically shoved it up my nose.
I got her to flip on him.

169
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:42,948
Lucky fuck, eh?

170
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,615
She scored it from him directly?

171
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,955
- Yeah, she did.
- Good.

172
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:50,689
Okay, well, get what you can out of her
and kick her loose.

173
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:53,165
I hate trying to prosecute
fucking lawyers.

174
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:04,137
- This isn't Spider's club.
- The back way in.

175
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:08,203
Yeah, it's an abandoned
linen factory, Jessica.

176
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:11,182
I guess I'm not your average...

177
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:12,707
what do you call it?

178
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:14,742
- Rat?
- Stoolie?

179
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:16,778
Thanks.

180
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:20,519
I mean, I think usually
it's some poor African-American kid

181
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,789
or a junkie or a prostitute.

182
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:25,388
Well, normally 200-grand-a-year
corporate lawyers

183
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:28,366
are much smarter than your average
African-American junkie whore...

184
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,028
normally, but sometimes
they only think they are.

185
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,937
It's all set
on this end.

186
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:35,634
Are you guys sure
it's safe in there?

187
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:38,734
You tell your girlfriend
to grow a pair and let's go.

188
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:41,837
What do you say, Counsel?
Are you ready to do this thing?

189
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,543
Yeah, let's get it over with.

190
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:47,552
Okay, remember what we said?
You go in there,

191
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:50,987
you wait for him to ask you
for what you need, right?

192
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:53,651
And then you don't come back here
with less than four ounces.

193
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:55,159
- Four ounces?
- Yeah.

194
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:57,856
Isn't that a lot? I, like, buy a couple
of balls at the club, that's it.

195
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,866
You just say you're going skiing and
you need a week's worth of fresh powder.

196
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,232
Yeah, you tell him you're going
on vacation.

197
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:09,869
I do this thing
and my record's wiped clean?

198
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,206
As a whistle.

199
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,211
No one at my law firm will know
that I got busted, right?

200
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,769
It never happened.

201
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:18,179
Look, Counsel, we all know you
better than this.

202
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:20,811
You just do this, you stop
shoving that shit up your nose,

203
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:22,616
you go home, you get married,
you have kids,

204
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:25,317
you never come back here,
and that's that.

205
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:29,157
Yeah.

206
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:32,027
Everybody's in position.

207
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:34,532
- Okay, we're going.
- Yes, sir.

208
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:39,497
Let's push the signal
back 50%.

209
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:42,531
Hey, Jessica.

210
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:44,041
Break a leg.

211
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,770
It's two flights down.

212
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:51,180
The door's on the left.
Ring the bell.

213
00:15:58,223 --> 00:16:00,691
Hey, Stubby, why don't you
go and escort our company up here?

214
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:04,519
Go on, fat boy.

215
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,924
Get it on.

216
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:20,239
- Good afternoon.
- Hey, Spider.

217
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,770
- I'll be downstairs.
- All right.

218
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,840
- How are you?
- All right, baby,

219
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:27,249
just checking out this wizard shit
before I let my kids watch it.

220
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:29,754
- You seen this?
- No.

221
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:32,256
The guy is a stone dealer.
I let my little ones watch this...

222
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,555
they'll all turn out junkies.
You know what I'm saying?

223
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:36,083
He's got a point.

224
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:38,323
- You remember Underdog?
- What about him?

225
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:41,299
That fucking dog spawned
a generation of junkies.

226
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:45,167
So you converted the bank
into a club and a recording studio?

227
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:47,764
- Yeah. You like it?
- Yeah.

228
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:49,706
What are you talking about?

229
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:51,471
What did Underdog do
all the time?

230
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,205
He was always shining shoes

231
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:55,406
and whenever Sweet Polly Purebred
would call out to him,

232
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:57,415
his dog ears would pick it up
and he'd rescue her.

233
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:59,917
Yeah, but what did he do
when he needed his super strength?

234
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:02,113
He'd go to his ring, remember?

235
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:04,019
Pull out a pill, pop it.

236
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:07,548
Holy shit, you're right.
He was a little fucking speed freak.

237
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:08,924
So what's the business?

238
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:11,794
How about a QP?
You're good for a QP.

239
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,491
The fuck you want with QP?

240
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:16,160
I'm going skiing with friends,

241
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,761
a lot of friends.

242
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:21,238
- Where?
- Aspen, Colorado.

243
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:24,003
Shit. I'm sure you can
score one in Aspen.

244
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,034
Not your primo brand.

245
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,479
You ski?

246
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:30,004
Sure. My whole life.

247
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,177
Come on, I don't have all day.

248
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,550
Why don't you put down your jacket,
stay a little while?

249
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:36,781
What do you think?

250
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:38,380
Actually,
I've got to run.

251
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:42,326
I have a major IPO
closing in an hour, so...

252
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:45,091
You know, stress will kill you.
You gotta chill out.

253
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:48,399
I'm as chill as I get.

254
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:50,425
What do you want to do?

255
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:56,172
You know, every once in a while...

256
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:00,402
one of you Upper East Side bitches
gets popped,

257
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:02,437
tries to to roll over
on a nigga like me.

258
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:04,574
You're scared now.

259
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:11,847
Looks like the cavalry
come to rescue you.

260
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,380
Can I help you, gentlemen?

261
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,858
Yeah, let us in, Spider.

262
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:17,088
I'm sorry, there's no one here
by that name.

263
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:20,030
- Let us in.
- We only want to talk to you.

264
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:25,635
See, I know how to look
and I know where to look.

265
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:33,545
Come to papa.

266
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:36,908
It always hurts the first time.

267
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,547
You all right?

268
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:41,382
Why wouldn't she be all right?
We're watching TV.

269
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,081
How the fuck is she gonna get hurt
watching TV?

270
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,716
She could have seen or heard
something that scared her.

271
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:47,657
- Like what?
- Like some big fucking mutt

272
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:49,217
shooting his bug fat
fucking mouth off.

273
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:52,128
Wasn't nobody here fitting that description
till a minute ago.

274
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:54,064
I'm gonna show you ugly,
you fucking mother...

275
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:56,567
- We've said enough.
- Oh, you finna bring your wife up in here?

276
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:59,662
That's it. That's it.
Let's go. It's okay.

277
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:02,435
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.

278
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,442
You want your wire back?

279
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:07,909
Firearm!

280
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:09,038
No, Stubby, no!

281
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,654
Get down.
Get the fuck down!

282
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:30,901
Come on.

283
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:33,734
The fat one's dead.

284
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,247
Well, that went well.

285
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:48,018
Oh, shit, you're bleeding.

286
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:52,115
3-4 squad, Central.
11-41, request ambulance.

287
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:54,955
I need EMS. Subject shot,
184th and St. Nicholas.

288
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:57,188
Really, I tried my best.

289
00:19:57,229 --> 00:20:00,528
You're doing just fine, Counsel.
You're doing just fine. Just relax.

290
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:03,660
Hey, guys, if you ever
need a lawyer...

291
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,432
Yeah, okay.

292
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:08,939
You bet.

293
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:13,907
In good old days
we used to

294
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:16,676
let the perp bleed out
and call off the ambulance.

295
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,649
- Calm calm calm.
- Fucking lowlife.

296
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:20,481
You made your point.
You made your point.

297
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,817
Tough little bitch, ain't you,
kicking a man while he's handcuffed?

298
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:25,345
Shut the fuck up,
you piece of shit.

299
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,017
You think I won't blow
your fucking head off?

300
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,822
I wouldn't think twice
about it.

301
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,124
I'd go in there,
get the fat boy's gun,

302
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:34,826
come back here
and put two between your eyes.

303
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:41,629
Where's EMS?

304
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:44,870
This thing was a clusterfuck
to end all clusterfucks.

305
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,468
You got nothing.

306
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:48,479
How about felony murder?

307
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:51,004
No drugs, right?
So no predicate felony,

308
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:52,949
no conspiracy,
no nothing.

309
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:55,010
No felony. No felony.
I can't believe this.

310
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:56,782
No felony.
How do you spell felony?

311
00:20:56,822 --> 00:21:00,155
Homicide, racketeering, drugs...
I mean, what are we talking about?

312
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:02,820
Hey, you're lucky
that white girl didn't die.

313
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:04,761
IAB is gonna interview
both of you

314
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:07,264
and do a preliminary report
over the next couple of weeks.

315
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:10,791
Now off the record
you actually didn't violate procedure

316
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:13,270
because the victim had a firearm
aimed at you,

317
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:15,535
so if you stick together
you should make it through this.

318
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:17,565
You'd better get
your story straight too,

319
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,442
'cause I'm not going back to Far Rockaway
because you two fucked up.

320
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:23,073
And you're gonna spend some couch time
with the rubber-gun squad.

321
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:26,915
And you'd better take this shrink seriously
or you'll be off active duty.

322
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,715
That fucking piece of shit
just walks.

323
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:30,551
Knock it off, Turk.

324
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:35,686
Relax, partner.
He's gonna get his.

325
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:38,252
Gentlemen, your questions.

326
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,697
- Who made the decision to enter?
- I did.

327
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:42,723
- Whose decision was it to enter?
- Mine.

328
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:45,066
Did you immediately identify yourselves
as police officers?

329
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:47,401
- Yes, we did.
- Did you immediately identify yourselves?

330
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:49,930
The informant's position
was becoming untenable.

331
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:52,239
- We were afraid she was in danger.
- Turns out you were right.

332
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:54,768
- No fucking kidding, nine-to-fiver.
- Excuse me, Detective?

333
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:57,213
Are you finished
with my client?

334
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:03,143
- They're like Lennon and McCartney.
- Not an inch of daylight between them.

335
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:04,416
What do you think?

336
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:05,753
Nothing there.

337
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:08,658
They endangered the informant.
We can't make them wrong on that.

338
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:10,321
They saw a gun, they reacted.

339
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:12,125
They beat the fuck
out of the suspect,

340
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,257
but he's not filing charges.

341
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:16,358
Let's see what the shrink says.

342
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:19,769
So what are we gonna
do now, Doc?

343
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:22,000
Are we gonna find out
if I'm sane enough

344
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,770
to carry a gun,
chase bad guys?

345
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:27,404
Okay, why did you become a cop?

346
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:30,176
Well, it was New Year's Eve.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

347
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:34,117
I didn't have the same opportunities
you had, Dr. Prosky.

348
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:36,848
Where I come from
it was either a gun and a badge

349
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:38,753
or a hard hat and a hammer.

350
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:41,258
How do you feel
when you fire your weapon?

351
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:44,023
It's like Dirty Harry said...
"There's nothing wrong

352
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:46,690
with a little shooting as long as
the right people get shot."

353
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:48,666
And when the wrong people
get shot?

354
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,669
It sucks, but I'd rather be in it
that out of it.

355
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,796
There's nothing worse
than being stuck on a bench.

356
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:56,069
How do you feel when you see
innocent people get killed?

357
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:58,338
You know...

358
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:03,309
I sort of get numb to it.

359
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:06,010
Here.

360
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,541
I want you to take this.

361
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:10,953
Use it to jot down your thoughts,
your questions,

362
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:13,480
anything you may have noticed
about yourself,

363
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:14,992
whatever.

364
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:16,857
I won't ask for it.

365
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,659
Just for you.

366
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:21,188
I want you to try it.

367
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,258
Sounds like fun.

368
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:28,698
Harder.

369
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:44,719
Go, Turk, go!

370
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:49,151
You got third.
Go go!

371
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:51,890
Yeah!
Look at that.

372
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,296
You own it. You own it.

373
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:56,197
No matter what they say
about you,

374
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:58,327
you're tremendous!

375
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:02,737
Go go, Turk, go!

376
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:06,669
Safe.
You dropped the ball.

377
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:09,043
- A fucking cheap shot, man.
- Get away from the bag.

378
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,015
- Or what? Or what? Or what?
- Watch the bag.

379
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:26,096
The NYPD is bubbling
with frustration,

380
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,723
hostility and testosterone,

381
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:29,757
ready to erupt
at any moment.

382
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,826
Think of me
as the release valve.

383
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:34,703
One flick of the trigger
and the pressure goes down.

384
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:36,832
You know why
you join the force?

385
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:38,968
To get respect.

386
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:40,739
Most people respect the badge.

387
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:43,111
Everybody respects the gun.

388
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:50,544
Hey, Riley, I was talking to JD...

389
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:53,649
you guys caught a stiff named
Phillip Trager, a gun-runner?

390
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:55,922
Oh, yeah, a real piece of shit.

391
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:57,895
- How did that go down?
- I don't know.

392
00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:00,193
Somebody gave him a taste
of his own medicine, I guess,

393
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:02,632
walked right into his apartment,
killed him with one of his own guns.

394
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,931
Did the shooter leave a note
or anything?

395
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,939
Yeah, actually,
the shooter left a poem.

396
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:13,567
He did?
No shit.

397
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:15,603
Yeah. Hey, Simon,

398
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:19,083
you remember that poem
from the Trager case?

399
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:23,145
What are you doing, man?

400
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:25,179
Turk's asking about it.

401
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:27,691
What the hell are you doing?

402
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:30,160
¿Qué mierda 'tas haciendo ahí, papá?

403
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,129
No le digas mierda a eso loco.

404
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:35,792
Cálmate. He wants to hear
about the poem.

405
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:38,064
"Merchant of thieving class,

406
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:41,231
I slit his throat
and capped his ass.

407
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:42,740
I took his gun, I took his...

408
00:25:42,774 --> 00:25:45,766
I took his life, I took his gun,
But too bad he's not the only one."

409
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,869
That's how it goes,
something like that.

410
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:50,211
It's not iambic pentameter,
but it rhymes.

411
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:52,239
- Rooster.
- Yo.

412
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:55,151
We're looking for the same guy.

413
00:25:55,186 --> 00:25:58,349
He knocked off a pimp named Rambo
a few weeks ago. When was yours?

414
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,915
Last week. We're running ours with the ATF
because of the guns.

415
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:04,019
We're back in business on the Rambo case.
Looks like the same guy knocked off

416
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:06,496
- a gun dealer on the three-three last week.
- No shit.

417
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:09,500
- What do you mean? That's our case.
- That's our case. You're taking our case.

418
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:12,002
Seniority, guys.
Tag along, you'll learn something.

419
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:14,198
Oh, tell me the guy's name
is Greg Brady.

420
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,207
Please. It is, isn't it?

421
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,801
Oh, somebody's knocking off
the Brady Bunch.

422
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:22,711
Gotta be the Partridge Family.

423
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:25,807
Trager,
a gun-runner bites the dust...

424
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,909
number 11.

425
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:40,094
The bullet matched the.45
in Trager's apartment.

426
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:42,599
That was no surprise.
So I ran it through ATF.

427
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:45,660
It's one of a batch of six
that was stolen from a gun shop

428
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:48,002
- in Virginia last month.
- Yeah, probably by Trager.

429
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:50,735
That's what they think.
He matches the description they have.

430
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:53,471
It still doesn't help us find the guy.
It just helps us tie him to the victims,

431
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:56,002
which he's already doing
with his little fucking poems.

432
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:59,107
Excuse me. Hello.

433
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:02,381
Hey, Turk, don't forget
we got a court date later.

434
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,583
So...

435
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:09,253
I heard he kicked the shit
out of that dealer you guys took down.

436
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,125
Spider.

437
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:12,322
So?

438
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:16,490
Did he?

439
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:21,965
Yeah, he got him
down on the ground.

440
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:24,407
The guy was handcuffed.

441
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:28,504
And he just started
kicking him in the gut.

442
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:30,946
And then

443
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:33,314
he gets down on the guy's chest

444
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:36,684
and he really starts smacking him

445
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:39,656
hard in the face over and over

446
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:41,682
and screaming at the top
of his lungs,

447
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:43,990
"I'm gonna break
your fucking face,

448
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:46,429
you little bitch!"

449
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:48,796
Then his eyes really started
to fill up.

450
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,824
I mean, they get dark...

451
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:53,030
you know how he gets
the sort of rage in him.

452
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,834
I thought he was gonna
kill this guy.

453
00:27:58,209 --> 00:28:00,677
Really?

454
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:05,781
You're a bad little girl.

455
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:07,682
Hmm?

456
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:10,779
- I got work to do.
- You bet.

457
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:16,158
Counselor,
my hands are tied here.

458
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,185
Without a secure
chain of custody,

459
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:20,959
any evidence obtained
after the initial search

460
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:23,467
- must be excluded.
- You gotta be fucking kidding me.

461
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:25,867
Therefore I am forced
to grant defense

462
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:28,202
motion to dismiss
all charges

463
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:30,434
of rape and assault
against Mr. Van Luytens.

464
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:32,466
- Your Honor.
- You think I want this guy

465
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,671
going anywhere
near my daughter,

466
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,874
or anyone's daughter
for that matter?

467
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:39,383
You messed up.
I am unleashing your client

468
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:41,681
unto the world.
I'm sure we'll all be

469
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,153
back here again very soon.

470
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:46,180
Look at him.
Look at this motherfucker.

471
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:49,819
Hey, it's gonna come back to you, mutt.
You're gonna get it.

472
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:52,295
- When you walk outside watch your back.
- Easy, Turk.

473
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,490
Order in my court.

474
00:28:53,531 --> 00:28:56,796
- Okay, mutt? You fucking mutt.
- Not here, not now.

475
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:59,269
Not here, not now.
Will you get him out of here

476
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:01,864
before somebody passes a sentence
on him you can't appeal?

477
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:03,134
Order!

478
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:06,302
- You know what I mean? Go go.
- Order, Detective.

479
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:10,303
Dr. Prosky suggested
that I free-associate.

480
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:12,748
So here I go.

481
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:15,412
You know what I think about
when I pull a trigger?

482
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:18,388
I think about the Infield Fly Rule.

483
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:21,449
I love that fucking rule.
It assumes the worst in everybody.

484
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:25,190
It says, "Sorry, batter, you're a schmuck
for popping up with runners on.

485
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,630
And you, stupid-ass infielder,
you don't get to cheat

486
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:30,099
and drop the ball just because
you caught a break."

487
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:31,796
My favorite part...
the batter's out

488
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:33,997
but the runners advance
at their own risk.

489
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:36,302
Well, isn't this
a pleasant surprise?

490
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:38,434
That's the way
life should be.

491
00:29:38,476 --> 00:29:40,467
You can be a motherfucker
at your own risk.

492
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:47,616
Or not.
Van Luytens... one less rapist.

493
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:49,882
Who's gonna miss him?
Nobody.

494
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:52,082
Number 12 and counting.

495
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:08,237
Whoa whoa, hot coffee.

496
00:30:08,273 --> 00:30:09,968
- Good morning, Detective Riley.
- Hey, good morning.

497
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:11,976
- Door on your left.
- Any signs of forced entry?

498
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,705
Doesn't look like it.
Detective Perez is in there.

499
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:15,144
He's in there already?
All right.

500
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,307
- Hey, how about those Mets last night?
- Yeah, how about 'em?

501
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:19,407
Hey, Teddy, Teddy, come here,
check this out.

502
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,185
Wow.

503
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:24,449
Fuck.

504
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:27,287
- Oh my God.
- That's big.

505
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,316
And powerful.

506
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,227
- What, a plasma screen?
- LCD.

507
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:34,322
- That's plasma.
- No, it's got to be LCD.

508
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:36,663
- It wouldn't be that big.
- Hey, guys, guys.

509
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:40,137
He was shot at close range,
dropped right here.

510
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,935
The pussy doesn't look like he put up
much of a fight, does he, Karen?

511
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:45,033
Nothing to indicate that

512
00:30:45,076 --> 00:30:48,603
in terms of struggle.
No forced entry, cuts, bruises.

513
00:30:48,646 --> 00:30:51,877
Hey, nobody wants to hear
about your private life, Officer Corelli.

514
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:55,147
That's detective to you,
Officer Needledick.

515
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:57,120
- Ooh.
- Ouch.

516
00:30:57,155 --> 00:30:59,487
- Looks like it's our guy again.
- Who did you get this time?

517
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,185
This is Jonathan Van Luytens.

518
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:03,160
He owns a couple
of car dealerships.

519
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:05,526
- Oh, shit.
- He was up on rape charges,

520
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:07,758
but they got tossed out
last week.

521
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,790
Look at this.

522
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:13,930
"A man devoid of all respect,
Of beauty, charm or intellect,

523
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:16,406
He took what women
would not give.

524
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:18,375
He didn't have
the right to live."

525
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:20,775
That's our boy all right.

526
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:23,975
Looks like he had a beef
with our old pal Jonny.

527
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:25,107
You know him?

528
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:27,014
Yeah.

529
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:29,349
He's one slippery
son of a bitch, let me tell you.

530
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:32,055
Yeah.

531
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:35,218
You guys know how much
fun it is to not catch a serial killer?

532
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,989
You got a point here, Lieutenant?

533
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:38,791
The point is

534
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,957
you'd better both
think seriously

535
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:43,092
about whether or not
you want the lead on this case.

536
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:44,795
You don't think
we're up to this?

537
00:31:45,803 --> 00:31:49,000
Come on, you got what,

538
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,736
about 110 years on the job
between the two of you?

539
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:54,836
120.

540
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:57,143
I'm telling you, you screw it up
badly enough,

541
00:31:57,181 --> 00:31:59,376
they may try to fuck you
out of your pension.

542
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,645
You want to risk that?

543
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:02,516
- Yeah.
- Fuck, yeah.

544
00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:07,513
406, Lieutenant. 406.

545
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:10,152
Okay, 406...
what does that mean?

546
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:11,718
Ted Williams.

547
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:14,823
Ted Williams, the last day of the season,
is batting 400.

548
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:17,960
Sox manager wants to bench him,
protect his average, right?

549
00:32:18,002 --> 00:32:19,799
Williams plays
both games anyway,

550
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:21,805
goes six for eight,
ends up at 406...

551
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:23,534
the last guy that ever hit
over 400.

552
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:26,065
Okay, fine. It's all yours.

553
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:29,136
Just don't go moaning to me
when some traffic cop

554
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,478
pulls your serial killer over
for speeding

555
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:34,144
and he grabs your
15 minutes of fame and you realize

556
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:37,348
the asshole could have been
standing right there in front of you

557
00:32:37,388 --> 00:32:40,448
and it would have taken you
1000 light years to nail him.

558
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:42,220
Not for nothing, Lieutenant,

559
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:45,320
light years measures distance,
not time.

560
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:50,200
Well, thank you, Detective.
I'll make a note of that.

561
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:53,067
Ellis Lynde, 2003.

562
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:55,868
This guy had a history
of cruising gay bars,

563
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:58,705
picking up twinkies,
beating the shit out of them.

564
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:01,644
Lynde was found shot dead
in his apartment.

565
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,580
Whoever's doing this
gets up real close to the guys,

566
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:07,277
blows their brains out
without any trouble,

567
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:08,808
leaves no fingerprints

568
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:10,650
and obviously
takes pride in his work.

569
00:33:10,688 --> 00:33:14,988
Okay, what could be
murder number two back from '04,

570
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:16,459
one Matthew Mitrella.

571
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:23,559
I was shaking
the first couple of times

572
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:26,434
I killed in cold blood.

573
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:29,804
I kept thinking if I got caught
they'd kick me off the force.

574
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:32,469
I wasn't worried about prison,
but losing the gun and the shield...

575
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,738
that scared me.

576
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:36,269
I went into work the next day
expecting to feel different.

577
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:39,408
I thought everybody would look at me
the way cops look at civilians

578
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,680
and know which ones are dirty.

579
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:50,991
But they didn't.
That's when I knew

580
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,623
I could keep on
doing this forever.

581
00:33:56,768 --> 00:34:00,704
So next stop... Spider.

582
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:02,729
If we shut down his business,

583
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:04,765
maybe he'd be a rat.

584
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:06,800
We got a lawyer.

585
00:34:06,844 --> 00:34:10,610
We needed her to testify
that she bought coke from him.

586
00:34:10,648 --> 00:34:13,208
She was a good lawyer.

587
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:17,711
Me and my partner paid a visit
to Club 404 of Harlem.

588
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:18,881
A word about him...

589
00:34:18,923 --> 00:34:22,017
Tom Cowen's been my partner
for almost 30 years.

590
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,994
He's the best cop
I've ever seen.

591
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:29,424
I'm always the one
following him through the door.

592
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:31,628
There's a bullet
that was meant for me

593
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:35,230
that's lodged in his torso.

594
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:37,332
He was my role model.

595
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:39,741
The day I stopped
trying to be Tom Cowen

596
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:42,245
was the greatest day
of my life.

597
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:59,086
Hey, Rooster,

598
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:02,156
I was going through the files
on poetry boy.

599
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,430
That's an interesting way
to pass your time.

600
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:06,903
Okay, there was a gun

601
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,099
found on Charles Randall
when he was arrested.

602
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,368
Yeah.

603
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:13,571
Now in all the other shootings
the gun was left at the scene,

604
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:16,774
but there are a lot of similarities.
So I mentioned it to Perez and Riley.

605
00:35:16,814 --> 00:35:18,873
I think somebody should go
interview him in prison.

606
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:21,544
I think there may be a connection.

607
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:25,044
That's a good idea,
but not Perez and Riley.

608
00:35:25,089 --> 00:35:27,523
I mean, not those guys.
They'll screw it up.

609
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:29,685
This is too important.

610
00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:32,195
Turk and I will handle Randall, okay?

611
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,788
Good work.

612
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:07,595
Detectives, Charles Randall.

613
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:12,561
What the fuck
do you two scumbags want?

614
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:15,299
What a greeting.

615
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:18,399
You like poetry, Chuck?

616
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:19,500
What?

617
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:22,741
Do you like poetry?

618
00:36:23,781 --> 00:36:27,478
Yeah.
Roses are red, violets are blue,

619
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:30,453
I want to poke out your fucking eyes
with my dick, you fuck.

620
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:32,479
How's that?

621
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:35,151
I thought you'd rhyme.
You didn't.

622
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,354
Fuck you.
Fuck both of you.

623
00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:39,022
Get me out of here.

624
00:36:49,006 --> 00:36:51,304
Why the fuck did we even bother
going out there?

625
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:53,435
What would it look like
if we didn't go?

626
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:57,374
Are you gonna relax?

627
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:59,406
Relax.

628
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:01,350
Yeah, I'll just take it out
on Karen later.

629
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:03,683
The more I'm with her,
the more abuse she wants.

630
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:04,983
Sounds like fun.

631
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:06,614
Hey, you want to take her
off my hands?

632
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:11,117
Be careful, partner, because I have
a very special effect on women.

633
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:12,356
Go wild.

634
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:13,795
Whatever.

635
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:16,823
I can't believe I had to face
that piece of shit and look like an idiot.

636
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:20,166
Eh, fuck him.
He's where he belongs.

637
00:37:20,204 --> 00:37:21,831
I'm sorry, partner,
I'm really sorry.

638
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:24,807
Stop worrying about it.

639
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:30,341
Whatever happens,
I'm not taking you down with me.

640
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:33,350
Don't worry about me.
I'm all right, believe me.

641
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:36,649
I don't know what I was thinking.
I just don't know what I was thinking.

642
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:39,019
You know what you was thinking?
You were thinking

643
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:41,718
about a 10-year-old girl
who had her skull crushed.

644
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:45,195
Yeah, I tried to stop you,
but you know what?

645
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:49,495
I admired you that day,
what you did.

646
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:52,502
That was righteous.

647
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:56,370
And you don't second-guess yourself
on something like that.

648
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:05,372
Okay, I'm the killer.

649
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:07,941
I'm the killer.
I show up at your door

650
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:09,976
or your car window,

651
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:12,319
and for some reason
you open your door,

652
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:15,291
you roll down
your car window for me.

653
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:17,521
So who am I?

654
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:19,927
Someone I know.

655
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,454
Maybe a nice set of tits.

656
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:23,592
And the poems?
What about the poems?

657
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:26,000
You have to compose the poem
before you got there, right?

658
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:28,028
Otherwise what, you're gonna
blow out the guy's brains,

659
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:29,937
sit down and write a little sonnet
for yourself?

660
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,373
No prints on the poems,

661
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:34,401
so probably
I wore gloves when I wrote it.

662
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:37,505
You obviously know your victims.
Between that and the easy access,

663
00:38:37,548 --> 00:38:39,880
I guess that they know you too.
They must.

664
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:42,351
These guys are all scumbags.
They're not gonna trust anyone,

665
00:38:42,386 --> 00:38:44,946
open the door for anyone,
especially if they don't know them.

666
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,321
Yeah, but I more than know them.

667
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:49,690
I know everything about them.
I know their moves,

668
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:51,592
their patterns,
I know their schedules.

669
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:54,427
Okay, so you're following them.
You're staking them out.

670
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:10,272
Anyone gonna say it?

671
00:39:10,314 --> 00:39:12,248
What?

672
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:17,414
Fuck me.

673
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:20,955
- He's right, it's a cop.
- No.

674
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:23,289
Let's slow down, fellows.
We're getting way ahead of ourselves.

675
00:39:23,327 --> 00:39:26,922
- Come on, it's a cop, you know it.
- I don't know shit. Neither do you.

676
00:39:26,964 --> 00:39:29,831
I'm telling your right now,
it's a cop, it's a cop, it's a cop.

677
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,562
What do you mean,
"It's a cop, it's a cop, it's a cop"?

678
00:39:31,602 --> 00:39:34,867
- Where do you come off saying it's a cop?
- Easy, partner, he's just saying it.

679
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:37,533
- What are you talking about?
- He's just saying...

680
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:40,874
I know, I know, I know
what he's saying.

681
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:44,309
And I'm saying it's bullshit.

682
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:48,285
Shoot me. What the fuck?
But don't say it's a cop.

683
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,621
# You cast a spell on me #

684
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:58,219
# I was blind and now I see #

685
00:39:58,262 --> 00:40:01,254
# You work your magic,
that's the key #

686
00:40:01,298 --> 00:40:03,858
# You wave your wand #

687
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:07,462
# And cast a spell on me... #

688
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:09,496
So what about dinner?

689
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,132
You feel like going out?

690
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:12,972
Where?

691
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:14,875
I don't care.
You're the one going.

692
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,743
What is your problem?

693
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:18,772
No problem.

694
00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:20,943
If you feel like hanging around,
be my guest.

695
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:22,316
I don't feel like going out.

696
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:25,516
Fine, just don't bug me.

697
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:29,686
This is the best part of my day
and I don't need you fucking it up.

698
00:40:31,495 --> 00:40:34,487
So you only fuck cops?

699
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:37,399
Once in a while
I do a fireman or an ex-con.

700
00:40:39,336 --> 00:40:40,997
You lump us in together?

701
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:43,165
Well, I have some respect
for firemen.

702
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:45,004
Fuck you.

703
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:46,976
You know why they take away
your nightstick

704
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:49,241
- when you hang up your uniform?
- No.

705
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,475
They don't trust you with it.

706
00:40:51,515 --> 00:40:53,676
Right now I wouldn't trust
myself with it either.

707
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:55,742
Shit, you'd probably love that.

708
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,447
Too bad you never met
Van Luytens.

709
00:40:57,488 --> 00:40:59,183
You two really would have
hit it off great.

710
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:01,384
At least somebody finally
brought some justice down

711
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:03,256
on that dickless little fuck.

712
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,592
Now that is who I'd like to meet.

713
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,529
Well, maybe you'll get
your wish one day.

714
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:09,396
They think it's a cop.

715
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:11,060
- Makes sense.
- Bullshit.

716
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:13,092
It's just some fucking psychopath.

717
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:15,469
Well, there's plenty of those
on the job.

718
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:25,472
- Are you sleeping well?
- Not really.

719
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:27,040
- Yep.
- Eating well?

720
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:28,551
- No.
- Yeah.

721
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:29,780
Any recurring nightmares?

722
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,311
Yeah, that I'm stuck
in a room with you forever.

723
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:34,889
Nope.

724
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:36,722
Do you think you're fit
to return to duty?

725
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,751
- Abso-fucking-lutely.
- Yeah.

726
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:41,924
- You ever think about retiring?
- You mean, death with benefits?

727
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:43,763
What's not to like?

728
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:45,769
- You ever think about retiring?
- Not really.

729
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:47,794
What have I got to look forward to?

730
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:50,033
Sailing my 26-footer
around Sheepshead Bay,

731
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:51,507
umpiring cops' softball?

732
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:53,635
- How about corporate security work?
- It's too dangerous.

733
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:56,942
- So what are you gonna do?
- Maybe I'll buy a boat.

734
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:59,073
All right, look,
I don't know if I believe this,

735
00:41:59,116 --> 00:42:00,879
but I'm just gonna
throw it out there.

736
00:42:00,918 --> 00:42:03,250
You guys say we're looking
for one of our own,

737
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:07,246
but what if it was an ex-cop,
somebody with an axe to grind?

738
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:08,952
You got one in mind?

739
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:12,121
He's thinking about Martin Baum

740
00:42:12,162 --> 00:42:14,926
our old lieutenant.

741
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:17,331
So what's the story with him?

742
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,359
He got fired a few years ago.

743
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:22,600
I'm not saying there's any motive,
but he knew all the victims.

744
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,201
Yeah, but Turk,
I knew most of those guys.

745
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:29,406
So did you, Riley, Perez.
Even Karen knew 'em.

746
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:31,505
- I'm just throwing it out there.
- Well, maybe you killed 'em.

747
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:34,848
Yeah, maybe I did.

748
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:37,046
The poems and the placement
of the weapons

749
00:42:37,087 --> 00:42:38,884
are all we've got
linking the kills,

750
00:42:38,923 --> 00:42:41,619
which means what we gotta do now
is get humping on the forensics.

751
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:44,025
That shouldn't be
too much of a problem.

752
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:46,052
We already got the girl
working on that.

753
00:42:46,096 --> 00:42:49,862
That's right, Karen's been
humping on it all week, as we speak.

754
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,368
What did you say?

755
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:53,665
Here we go again.

756
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:55,467
- You should watch your mouth.
- Oh, yeah?

757
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:57,974
He didn't mean anything by it.
Karen and him are ancient history.

758
00:42:58,008 --> 00:43:00,169
- College boy can't speak for himself?
- Yeah, I can speak for myself.

759
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:02,007
Let me speak for myself...
fuck you, Turk.

760
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:04,014
Mutt, I'm gonna hit you
on the head with this barbell.

761
00:43:04,048 --> 00:43:06,141
I'm not better than you.
You're not better than me, man.

762
00:43:06,183 --> 00:43:07,878
You put your balls
in your pocket.

763
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,579
And you, fellow officers,

764
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:13,818
a little courtesy
for a fellow professional, you know?

765
00:43:13,857 --> 00:43:16,883
Please. Are we gonna move on
here now?

766
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:18,918
What are we doing?
Where were we?

767
00:43:18,963 --> 00:43:22,524
Talking about Martin Baum.
What's his story?

768
00:43:22,566 --> 00:43:25,057
Some guys under him
got caught taking money.

769
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:27,366
Baum stood up for them,
tried to cover it up.

770
00:43:27,404 --> 00:43:29,804
He do time?

771
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,673
Well, they pressed charges,
but he plead out and resigned.

772
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:34,701
So what's his beef with you?

773
00:43:34,745 --> 00:43:36,576
I could have lied to protect him,
but I didn't.

774
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:39,606
Okay, but if he's got a beef with you,
why not go after you?

775
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:42,141
Why not kill you? Why go around
acting like a serial killer,

776
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:44,051
killing all these degenerates?
It doesn't make any sense.

777
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:46,522
- I'm just telling you.
- I'm telling you it doesn't make sense.

778
00:43:46,557 --> 00:43:48,616
I'm throwing it out there.
I'm saying this is what it is.

779
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:50,752
You want to check him out or not?
I don't give a shit.

780
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:53,319
- It doesn't make any sense.
- You're the ones that think it's a cop.

781
00:43:53,364 --> 00:43:55,298
I'm just saying here's a cop
with a chip on his shoulder.

782
00:43:55,332 --> 00:43:57,323
Check him out if you want.
I don't give a shit.

783
00:43:57,368 --> 00:44:00,701
Calm down and give a better reason
why Baum could be a suspect, okay?

784
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:04,973
PMS, gotta be.

785
00:44:11,749 --> 00:44:14,650
- Hey, guys.
- What's going on?

786
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:17,085
I came over to bring you
the FBI report

787
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:19,089
on the paper
and handwriting.

788
00:44:19,123 --> 00:44:21,250
You don't have a problem
with me looking over the evidence

789
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:23,725
that I collected and processed
for you, do you?

790
00:44:23,761 --> 00:44:25,661
- No problem.
- Put it back, Karen.

791
00:44:25,696 --> 00:44:27,687
- This is fascinating.
- Let's go, come on.

792
00:44:27,731 --> 00:44:29,699
Come on, let's go, let's go.

793
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:31,530
- What?
- Come on, let's go.

794
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:33,593
Get your hands off me.

795
00:44:33,637 --> 00:44:35,867
I'll give you a little privacy.
I don't want to interrupt anything here.

796
00:44:35,906 --> 00:44:37,703
Are you afraid of me
looking at your old case files?

797
00:44:37,741 --> 00:44:40,209
- Is that it?
- Okay, I'm gone. Enjoy.

798
00:44:40,244 --> 00:44:42,235
- What?
- What is it with you?

799
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:44,304
What is it with you?

800
00:44:47,651 --> 00:44:51,109
I'm sorry about last night, okay?

801
00:44:51,155 --> 00:44:53,817
I really am. It's a habit.

802
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:56,758
Habits can be broken, right?

803
00:44:56,794 --> 00:44:58,193
That's bullshit.

804
00:44:58,228 --> 00:44:59,490
No.

805
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,998
I'm totally serious, all right?

806
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:05,765
It's not bullshit,

807
00:45:05,803 --> 00:45:07,794
really.

808
00:45:14,478 --> 00:45:16,946
Why do you think
Turk was so quick to take the lead

809
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:19,881
on the poetry case, huh?
To keep us from finding the killer, man.

810
00:45:19,917 --> 00:45:22,283
That's what I would do
if I was covering my tracks.

811
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:25,254
He sticks us on this Baum stakeout
'cause it's more misdirection.

812
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:26,449
Makes sense.

813
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:28,685
I hate that Turk, man.

814
00:45:57,354 --> 00:45:59,345
Hey, he's coming out.
He's coming out.

815
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:03,924
Oh, at 2:45 in the morning.

816
00:46:07,197 --> 00:46:10,655
Is it killing time
or is he just killing time?

817
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:32,778
Come on, Baum,
go kill someone already.

818
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:35,348
Yeah, kill Turk, man.
He's the one setting you up.

819
00:46:35,392 --> 00:46:36,859
Do us all a favor.

820
00:46:41,999 --> 00:46:44,490
Hey, did you see Turk's
marksmanship scores?

821
00:46:44,535 --> 00:46:46,093
Did you see this?
It's ridiculous.

822
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:48,036
Service... 99,
70 out of 100.

823
00:46:48,071 --> 00:46:51,507
Combat Association awards,
department commendations.

824
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:53,942
This guy could take out your left nut
at 50 yards.

825
00:46:57,214 --> 00:46:59,239
Did you see the computer
trajectories, man?

826
00:46:59,283 --> 00:47:00,716
Not one stray slug.

827
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:03,083
Even Berkowitz put a couple
in the Corinthian leather.

828
00:47:08,225 --> 00:47:10,693
What about Karen?
She come up with anything new?

829
00:47:10,727 --> 00:47:12,592
No, not yet.

830
00:47:12,629 --> 00:47:14,597
If Baum kills somebody
I don't want us to be in the car

831
00:47:14,631 --> 00:47:16,997
waiting when it happens, okay?

832
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:20,497
I'll go.

833
00:47:20,537 --> 00:47:22,528
Attaboy, Teddy, attaboy.

834
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:23,938
I'm proud of you, son.

835
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:37,313
You're Perez, right?

836
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:38,685
Yeah.

837
00:47:38,722 --> 00:47:40,417
I'm Martin Baum.

838
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:46,154
I got a permit for this.

839
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:48,926
I work security
in the diamond district.

840
00:47:48,966 --> 00:47:51,764
So you figure it's a cop
doing the poetry killings?

841
00:47:51,802 --> 00:47:54,669
Someone says, "Check out Baum.
He thinks he got a raw deal."

842
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:57,139
That's what passes
for police work these days?

843
00:47:57,174 --> 00:47:58,664
Do you think
you got a raw deal?

844
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,574
Damn straight.

845
00:48:00,611 --> 00:48:02,943
- Life sucks.
- Yeah.

846
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:05,540
- Everything okay, Simon?
- Teddy, where the fuck were you, man?

847
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:07,880
Anything else you want to tell us,
Lieutenant Baum?

848
00:48:07,918 --> 00:48:11,820
- I got something for you in my pocket.
- Huh-uh!

849
00:48:13,357 --> 00:48:18,090
A passport, credit card receipts,
boarding passes.

850
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:20,119
The day Brady was killed

851
00:48:20,163 --> 00:48:22,332
I was escorting a client
to Brazil.

852
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:29,764
Judgment is
the dominion of the Lord.

853
00:48:29,806 --> 00:48:32,707
And if this person,
this worthless rapist

854
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:35,268
or murderer,
as you describe him,

855
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:38,713
if he is truly repentant
and seeks absolution,

856
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:41,115
it must be granted to him.

857
00:48:41,151 --> 00:48:43,585
Your name doesn't ring a bell,

858
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:47,886
but I've had so many
altar boys over the years.

859
00:48:51,995 --> 00:48:53,986
So many altar boys

860
00:48:54,031 --> 00:48:56,727
that it's hard to remember
their names.

861
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:59,827
My name is David Fisk,
Detective First Grade.

862
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:02,134
You may not
remember me now,

863
00:49:02,172 --> 00:49:05,335
but I guarantee you'll remember my name
for the rest of your life.

864
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:09,243
Father Connell,
may he rot in hell.

865
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:11,747
13 down, one to go.

866
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:23,785
White underwear
below the knee.

867
00:49:23,827 --> 00:49:26,295
Briefs-style.

868
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:28,764
Large tweezers.

869
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:32,257
I am removing a card that has been
inserted in the rectum of the deceased

870
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:36,329
and placing it
in a plastic evidence bag.

871
00:49:39,042 --> 00:49:42,773
- I'll be right back.
- All right.

872
00:49:44,448 --> 00:49:47,076
Hey. It's another one,

873
00:49:47,117 --> 00:49:49,312
handwritten.

874
00:49:52,589 --> 00:49:55,353
"The old man
who the children trust,

875
00:49:55,392 --> 00:49:59,021
Unable to control his lust,

876
00:49:59,062 --> 00:50:01,963
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

877
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:06,060
The church can't stop him.
Someone must."

878
00:50:07,437 --> 00:50:09,428
I'll see what else I can find.

879
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:17,276
What's the matter with you?

880
00:50:17,314 --> 00:50:19,612
Father Connell gave me
my first communion

881
00:50:19,649 --> 00:50:22,413
back in Bensonhurst.

882
00:50:24,788 --> 00:50:27,279
Hey, guys.
Sorry we didn't get a chance to call.

883
00:50:27,324 --> 00:50:30,384
- Yeah, I bet you are.
- Go over there, take a look around.

884
00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:32,554
We'll compare notes later, okay?

885
00:50:32,596 --> 00:50:35,724
Looks like our friend just settled
an old score with the priest,

886
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:37,757
left him with his pants down.

887
00:50:37,801 --> 00:50:39,428
- Come on.
- No, look.

888
00:50:39,469 --> 00:50:40,936
Come on, don't talk like that.

889
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:42,939
- Hey, look for yourself.
- Have a little respect.

890
00:50:44,474 --> 00:50:47,671
Next thing they're gonna tell us
Lieutenant Baum was an altar boy here.

891
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:51,147
Tell me about it.
These two guys fucking stink.

892
00:50:51,181 --> 00:50:53,513
Look, Doctor,
you read the poems.

893
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:55,780
It is possible, right,
that this guy is a cop?

894
00:50:55,819 --> 00:50:58,185
I've never seen it.

895
00:50:58,221 --> 00:51:01,019
I've never even heard
about a cop serial killer.

896
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:03,219
Come on, girls,
let's go, let's go.

897
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:08,186
Yeah. Go go go go go
go go go go!

898
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:09,255
Safe.

899
00:51:09,299 --> 00:51:11,767
Doc, give us a tip.
How are we gonna catch this guy?

900
00:51:11,802 --> 00:51:13,793
You don't have to worry
about that.

901
00:51:13,837 --> 00:51:15,498
He wants to get caught.

902
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:20,470
You don't have any better place
to have lunch?

903
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:22,307
I wanted to thank you.

904
00:51:22,345 --> 00:51:24,074
What, about Spider?

905
00:51:24,114 --> 00:51:25,775
Yeah.

906
00:51:25,816 --> 00:51:28,410
And for looking in on me
at the hospital

907
00:51:28,452 --> 00:51:29,976
and the encouragement.

908
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:31,317
Why would he want that?

909
00:51:31,354 --> 00:51:33,914
After a while
getting away with it isn't enough.

910
00:51:33,957 --> 00:51:35,948
So is your daughter
on the team?

911
00:51:35,992 --> 00:51:38,825
No, she used to play,
but now she's 25, living in California,

912
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:41,558
five years sober
and working as a nurse.

913
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:43,759
And her mother?

914
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,825
Her mother died
when she was very young.

915
00:51:46,837 --> 00:51:49,772
He wants everybody to know
that he got away with it,

916
00:51:49,806 --> 00:51:53,833
to show everybody
just how brilliant he is.

917
00:51:53,877 --> 00:51:57,040
Most of these killings were criminals
in Rooster's and his beat, right?

918
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,945
And then he all but threatens
to kill Van Luytens

919
00:51:58,982 --> 00:52:00,950
in front of hundreds of witnesses.
And then he sends us

920
00:52:00,984 --> 00:52:04,044
on this crazy wild goose chase
after Lieutenant Baum, didn't he?

921
00:52:04,087 --> 00:52:06,078
- Yes, he did.
- Why would he do that? Why?

922
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:08,648
You gotta show me more than that.
So far you got shit.

923
00:52:08,692 --> 00:52:10,284
- Give him more, man.
- You want more?

924
00:52:10,327 --> 00:52:12,955
- How about the church records?
- The very ones that Turk was

925
00:52:12,996 --> 00:52:14,930
so diligently pursuing.
How about that?

926
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:17,866
It turns out our most recent victim,
the late Father Connell,

927
00:52:17,901 --> 00:52:20,631
was moved all over the place...
eight parishes in 20 years.

928
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:23,161
Why would they do that
with a Catholic priest? It's obvious.

929
00:52:23,206 --> 00:52:25,697
He's giving the children
more than communion behind the altar.

930
00:52:25,742 --> 00:52:28,176
Now Turk already admits
to knowing this guy as a child.

931
00:52:28,211 --> 00:52:29,542
It's very plausible.

932
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:34,144
This priest,
this Father Connell,

933
00:52:34,184 --> 00:52:35,879
he gave you your first
holy communion, eh?

934
00:52:35,919 --> 00:52:37,045
He did.

935
00:52:37,087 --> 00:52:40,318
Did he every try to do
anything inappropriate? I mean...

936
00:52:40,357 --> 00:52:42,348
I know what you mean.
No, never.

937
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:46,051
Okay, fine.
Is there any reason

938
00:52:46,096 --> 00:52:48,326
why somebody out there
might think that he did?

939
00:52:48,365 --> 00:52:49,923
No.

940
00:52:49,966 --> 00:52:52,298
Am I a suspect here, Lieutenant?

941
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:55,361
No,

942
00:52:55,405 --> 00:52:59,239
but these bodies
are starting to smell.

943
00:52:59,276 --> 00:53:01,870
A lot of it is drifting
in your direction.

944
00:53:01,912 --> 00:53:03,903
Drifting or being pushed?

945
00:53:03,947 --> 00:53:06,040
What can I say?

946
00:53:06,082 --> 00:53:08,516
You got connections
to most of these victims.

947
00:53:08,552 --> 00:53:11,487
You're not exactly
Mother Teresa.

948
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:15,690
I never had any problem
with that priest.

949
00:53:15,725 --> 00:53:18,660
Okay. Okay, fine.

950
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:21,425
That settles it.

951
00:53:27,571 --> 00:53:29,664
I had a talk with Riley and Perez.

952
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:31,230
Good cops.

953
00:53:31,274 --> 00:53:33,742
Don't fuck around, okay?
Just listen.

954
00:53:33,777 --> 00:53:35,039
I'm listening.

955
00:53:35,078 --> 00:53:37,478
They think
Turk might be our guy.

956
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:43,614
Oh, man. I gotta tell you,

957
00:53:43,653 --> 00:53:46,349
from where I'm sitting
that is so fucking funny.

958
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:48,448
You can't take that seriously.

959
00:53:48,491 --> 00:53:51,460
Everybody has pretty much
accepted the fact

960
00:53:51,494 --> 00:53:54,054
- that we're chasing one of our own.
- But it ain't Turk.

961
00:53:54,097 --> 00:53:55,860
Sure as I'm sitting here
he ain't the guy.

962
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:57,526
- You know that?
- Yes, I do.

963
00:53:57,567 --> 00:54:00,035
- How do you know that?
- Because I know it.

964
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:02,630
I know it to a moral certainty.

965
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:04,139
Okay?

966
00:54:05,342 --> 00:54:07,333
This priest,

967
00:54:07,377 --> 00:54:09,971
this Father Connell...

968
00:54:10,013 --> 00:54:12,311
he was Turk's priest
when he was a kid.

969
00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:13,373
He told you that.

970
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:15,714
He didn't tell me this priest
was a child molester.

971
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:18,687
- I can't believe this bullshit.
- Believe it, all right?

972
00:54:18,722 --> 00:54:21,282
- Turk's a good guy.
- You understand?

973
00:54:21,324 --> 00:54:23,588
- He's the best cop you got.
- Don't you tell me what I gotta do.

974
00:54:23,627 --> 00:54:25,686
Don't you say a goddamn word
to him about this either,

975
00:54:25,729 --> 00:54:27,663
or you're finished.

976
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:39,598
Can I speak now?

977
00:54:39,643 --> 00:54:41,440
Feel free.

978
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:46,279
He cares.
You know what I'm saying?

979
00:54:46,316 --> 00:54:49,217
Turk cares about people.

980
00:54:50,553 --> 00:54:53,545
I know he runs around
like a pit bull on crack sometimes.

981
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:56,184
It doesn't matter.

982
00:54:56,226 --> 00:54:58,490
He cares about protecting people.

983
00:54:58,528 --> 00:55:00,587
And if you don't back him,

984
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:04,501
you will regret it.

985
00:55:25,722 --> 00:55:27,212
Jesus.

986
00:55:27,257 --> 00:55:28,986
Sorry.

987
00:55:29,025 --> 00:55:31,721
I just never rattled
anyone's cage before.

988
00:55:31,761 --> 00:55:34,821
- Got a minute?
- Yeah, what's up?

989
00:55:34,864 --> 00:55:38,265
You know me and Turk
are buddies, right?

990
00:55:38,301 --> 00:55:39,791
Of course.

991
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:41,326
I'd do anything for him.

992
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:43,771
He would do anything for you.

993
00:55:43,807 --> 00:55:45,035
Would you?

994
00:55:45,075 --> 00:55:46,599
Would I what?

995
00:55:46,643 --> 00:55:48,668
Would you do anything for him?

996
00:55:52,215 --> 00:55:54,012
I don't know...
where is this going?

997
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:56,075
He wants you
to have sex with me.

998
00:55:58,221 --> 00:56:00,121
Really?

999
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:03,856
He wouldn't mind.

1000
00:56:03,893 --> 00:56:06,589
But that's not why I'm here.

1001
00:56:06,629 --> 00:56:09,291
Okay, why are you here?

1002
00:56:09,332 --> 00:56:12,563
Where were you
the night Rambo was killed

1003
00:56:12,602 --> 00:56:15,571
and Trager?
Got an alibi for those nights?

1004
00:56:17,073 --> 00:56:20,304
I mean, did you know either one
those guys before they were murdered?

1005
00:56:20,343 --> 00:56:23,312
Makes you uncomfortable
when I talk like that.

1006
00:56:23,346 --> 00:56:26,144
You look like you're guilty.
You're not guilty.

1007
00:56:26,182 --> 00:56:28,275
I know that.
You didn't kill those guys, did you?

1008
00:56:31,955 --> 00:56:34,981
Now you know what Turk feels.

1009
00:56:39,028 --> 00:56:42,759
I need you to get me
some information

1010
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:44,824
discreetly.

1011
00:56:46,469 --> 00:56:47,902
Can you do that for me?

1012
00:56:47,937 --> 00:56:50,201
You got it.

1013
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,901
Absolutely.

1014
00:56:51,941 --> 00:56:53,932
Let's solve these fucking murders.

1015
00:56:58,314 --> 00:56:59,679
Oh.

1016
00:56:59,716 --> 00:57:01,809
- Hey, boy genius.
- Perfect timing, buddy.

1017
00:57:01,851 --> 00:57:03,876
Listen, you really worked
on Hingis, didn't you?

1018
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,615
He was all worked up
about my partner.

1019
00:57:05,655 --> 00:57:07,555
Good. He should be.

1020
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:10,150
I think we should sit down,
see if we can square things, okay?

1021
00:57:10,193 --> 00:57:13,390
All right. Want to meet at Montrose
at 8:00 PM?

1022
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:16,729
Could you make that 9:00?
I gotta meet an old friend.

1023
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:18,393
Yeah, sure, whatever you want.

1024
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:24,236
#Baby's got issues #

1025
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:27,732
# Baby's got pains... #

1026
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:29,768
- Hey, fellows.
- Hey.

1027
00:57:29,813 --> 00:57:32,976
Thanks for coming.

1028
00:57:33,016 --> 00:57:35,644
- This here is Cheryl Brooks.
- Hello, Cheryl Brooks.

1029
00:57:35,685 --> 00:57:37,676
Cheryl's got something to tell you.

1030
00:57:38,855 --> 00:57:42,484
My daughter Lynn

1031
00:57:42,525 --> 00:57:45,050
died four years ago.

1032
00:57:45,094 --> 00:57:48,029
She was 10 years old.
She was raped and she was murdered.

1033
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:54,263
The guy I was living with,
Charles...

1034
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:55,464
Charles Randall.

1035
00:57:55,505 --> 00:57:58,599
Yeah, Charles Randall... he did it.

1036
00:57:58,641 --> 00:58:01,439
Why are you telling us this?

1037
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:04,606
Because he got off for that.
He was acquitted at trial.

1038
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:06,877
- Because?
- Because?

1039
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:10,949
I testified for him.

1040
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:13,820
- You did what?
- I said he was with me.

1041
00:58:15,391 --> 00:58:19,088
You see, Cheryl here is
a very forgiving person,

1042
00:58:19,128 --> 00:58:21,426
unlike us hard-asses.

1043
00:58:21,464 --> 00:58:23,728
- He threatened to kill me.
- Okay, Cheryl.

1044
00:58:23,766 --> 00:58:27,224
Now you say goodbye
to the nice officers

1045
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:31,104
and you go on back home.

1046
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:33,938
Don't drink yourself to death.

1047
00:58:36,045 --> 00:58:38,570
Okay, so...

1048
00:58:38,615 --> 00:58:40,981
eh?

1049
00:58:43,887 --> 00:58:46,617
I want to hear you say it.

1050
00:58:46,656 --> 00:58:49,250
Come on, say it.

1051
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:57,689
We planted the gun
in Randall's apartment, okay?

1052
00:58:57,734 --> 00:59:00,066
I said it. Happy?

1053
00:59:00,103 --> 00:59:01,695
- Thank you.
- Yes, I am.

1054
00:59:01,738 --> 00:59:04,502
I'd do it again if I had to
'cause that fucking maggot

1055
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:08,341
could rot away for all eternity.
I'd sleep just fine.

1056
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:09,777
So what do you want from us?

1057
00:59:09,812 --> 00:59:12,303
You guys think
my partner's a serial killer.

1058
00:59:12,348 --> 00:59:14,145
You're way off.

1059
00:59:14,183 --> 00:59:17,243
You like Turk for this thing?
Go have your fun.

1060
00:59:17,287 --> 00:59:19,687
I'll go along with you.

1061
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:22,282
I'll even help you.

1062
00:59:22,325 --> 00:59:25,988
But do not drag up Chuck Randall
and that fucking gun,

1063
00:59:26,029 --> 00:59:29,465
because if he walks out of jail
he's gonna end up dead.

1064
00:59:29,499 --> 00:59:31,558
Excuse me?

1065
00:59:33,136 --> 00:59:36,572
I'll put two
through his fucking head

1066
00:59:36,606 --> 00:59:39,166
myself.

1067
00:59:39,208 --> 00:59:41,472
Done deal.

1068
00:59:54,524 --> 00:59:57,459
My grandmother loved opera.

1069
00:59:57,493 --> 00:59:59,518
She supported us by sewing.

1070
00:59:59,562 --> 01:00:02,656
I used to thread needles
for my grandmother.

1071
01:00:02,699 --> 01:00:04,997
- Gave all her money to church.
- You admired her?

1072
01:00:05,034 --> 01:00:07,161
I worshipped her.

1073
01:00:07,203 --> 01:00:10,001
Rooster? Yeah, he's religious,
goes to church.

1074
01:00:10,039 --> 01:00:11,734
How about you?

1075
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:15,369
Our job is keeping
99% of the population safe

1076
01:00:15,411 --> 01:00:18,847
from the other 1%.

1077
01:00:18,881 --> 01:00:22,476
The problem is that we have to
spend half our lives with that 1%.

1078
01:00:22,518 --> 01:00:24,315
And the better we do that job,

1079
01:00:24,354 --> 01:00:26,914
the less the other 99% think
they need us.

1080
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:29,584
They're clueless.

1081
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:31,560
The only ones paying attention
on the street

1082
01:00:31,594 --> 01:00:33,994
are the cops and the criminals.
Everyone else is just

1083
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:36,794
going somewhere
or shopping.

1084
01:00:42,438 --> 01:00:44,633
- Out.
- Come on.

1085
01:00:44,674 --> 01:00:47,165
I got an order here placing you
on restricted duty.

1086
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:49,701
Now in plain English that means
you'll work at your desk.

1087
01:00:49,746 --> 01:00:51,805
You might want to cooperate
with the shrink

1088
01:00:51,848 --> 01:00:54,612
next time you two meet,
and you will meet again.

1089
01:00:58,554 --> 01:01:01,489
Cool my fucking heels.
Cool my fucking heels, huh?

1090
01:01:01,524 --> 01:01:04,254
I'm gonna blow a fucking hole
in that motherfucker Perez

1091
01:01:04,293 --> 01:01:07,160
and blow right through his head
for putting me through this bullshit.

1092
01:01:07,196 --> 01:01:09,096
- Turk.
- Fuck, I'm gonna...

1093
01:01:09,132 --> 01:01:10,429
kill that motherfucker.

1094
01:01:10,466 --> 01:01:13,264
Calm down. What the hell is it?
You're making all the wrong moves.

1095
01:01:13,302 --> 01:01:15,133
What are you talking about?
This ain't a chess game, partner.

1096
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:17,605
Who knows? Maybe it is.
You go at Perez now...

1097
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:20,131
you know what's gonna happen?
You're gonna walk right into a trap.

1098
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:22,337
You are.
They're just waiting for you.

1099
01:01:22,378 --> 01:01:24,073
Fucking Hingis.

1100
01:01:24,113 --> 01:01:26,377
Fucking Hingis believes him.

1101
01:01:26,416 --> 01:01:29,408
He actually fucking believes
that motherfucking Perez.

1102
01:01:29,452 --> 01:01:30,942
Stay back. Wait.

1103
01:01:30,987 --> 01:01:34,423
Wait for the right time,
then fire away.

1104
01:01:34,457 --> 01:01:36,322
Not now. Now is not the right time.

1105
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:38,657
Believe me.

1106
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:41,027
You believe me?
Now is not the time.

1107
01:01:41,064 --> 01:01:42,156
Uh-huh.

1108
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:44,325
- Please.
- Yeah.

1109
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:48,133
Hey, Turk, I gotta skip tonight.
My class ran late.

1110
01:01:48,171 --> 01:01:50,571
But I'll see you
tomorrow, all right?

1111
01:01:50,606 --> 01:01:53,507
And I'm sorry about what happened
with you and Lieutenant Hingis today.

1112
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:55,670
It's gonna be fine.
It'll blow over.

1113
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:58,647
People are just... everyone's crazy.
People are overreacting.

1114
01:01:58,681 --> 01:02:01,343
All right? Good night.

1115
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:09,751
It's a cop, it's a cop, it's a cop.

1116
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:21,301
What you got for me, good-looking?

1117
01:02:26,509 --> 01:02:29,569
Mark my words, there's a reason
Perez is gunning for me.

1118
01:02:29,612 --> 01:02:32,342
Perez is too smart to be that stupid.

1119
01:02:32,381 --> 01:02:35,009
For one thing, all that college-boy crap...
that's bullshit.

1120
01:02:35,051 --> 01:02:37,281
He did one year at SUNY,
only one year.

1121
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:38,309
No kidding.

1122
01:02:38,354 --> 01:02:40,754
They threw him out...
disruptive influence.

1123
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:43,486
And I hear from the 240 he mixed it up bad
with a captain over there.

1124
01:02:43,526 --> 01:02:45,756
The guy is a total
fucking asshole.

1125
01:02:45,795 --> 01:02:47,626
BMW 3 series,

1126
01:02:47,663 --> 01:02:49,995
Mercedes CLK... too light.

1127
01:02:50,032 --> 01:02:53,001
BMW 7 series...
the biggest engine.

1128
01:02:53,035 --> 01:02:55,697
That's what you have to get.
If they shoot at you,

1129
01:02:55,738 --> 01:02:58,536
you still want
to get the fuck out of there...

1130
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:02,107
Bentley... very good

1131
01:03:02,145 --> 01:03:04,909
because can fuck two prostitutes
in back seat

1132
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:08,678
and mount flame-thrower
on the hood. Da?

1133
01:03:08,718 --> 01:03:10,049
Da.

1134
01:03:10,086 --> 01:03:12,418
- What about a Cadillac?
- Come on,

1135
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:15,947
the fucking car can't turn
fucking corner. Are you kidding me?

1136
01:03:15,992 --> 01:03:17,823
You know either one of those
Neanderthals?

1137
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:20,624
The wop is Joe Scianci from Bensonhurst.
He's a mid-level guy.

1138
01:03:20,663 --> 01:03:22,597
What about Ivan?

1139
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:24,463
Russian guy,
Yevgeny Magulat,

1140
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:28,630
an enforcer for the Italians,
works with Gambinos a lot.

1141
01:03:33,075 --> 01:03:35,737
That shit's getting to me.

1142
01:03:35,778 --> 01:03:37,803
I know it's getting to you.

1143
01:03:39,549 --> 01:03:41,983
Shit gets to me too, you know,

1144
01:03:42,018 --> 01:03:45,112
but I take it in, I let it out
on my own terms.

1145
01:03:46,722 --> 01:03:48,781
I bet you didn't write
one word down

1146
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:50,725
in that little notebook
Prosky gave us.

1147
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:53,320
Of course not. Did you?

1148
01:03:53,362 --> 01:03:55,694
Yeah, it's great.

1149
01:03:57,266 --> 01:03:59,632
It helps me put things in perspective.

1150
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:03,662
You know what I'm saying?
Write it down, get it out.

1151
01:04:03,706 --> 01:04:06,231
- You should try this.
- Let's have a look.

1152
01:04:06,275 --> 01:04:08,903
What, are you kidding me?
Oh, come on, come on.

1153
01:04:08,945 --> 01:04:11,413
This belongs to me... private.

1154
01:04:11,447 --> 01:04:15,816
- You don't want to let me see?
- Close to my heart. No, sir.

1155
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:18,047
I just got sick
of the whole fucking game...

1156
01:04:18,087 --> 01:04:20,555
run around looking for clues,
making arrests,

1157
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:23,115
write reports, testify, cut deals.

1158
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:26,060
It was all just so much
fucking bullshit.

1159
01:04:28,965 --> 01:04:30,125
Detective...

1160
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:37,271
Then it all got real simple.

1161
01:04:37,306 --> 01:04:40,332
Yeah, Detective Perez here.
Hey, brother, what's up?

1162
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:43,311
I hate scumbags. I like shooting people.
What was I giving up?

1163
01:04:43,346 --> 01:04:46,338
Hey, look, I set the meeting up
with Rooster first thing tomorrow.

1164
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:49,783
Come on, you gotta be fast, man.
I don't want Turk getting wind of anything.

1165
01:04:49,819 --> 01:04:52,185
A retirement party and a gold watch?

1166
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:55,019
A handshake from the mayor
and my name on some fucking plaque?

1167
01:05:01,264 --> 01:05:02,458
Big fucking deal.

1168
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:05,724
It's better this way.

1169
01:05:07,536 --> 01:05:10,369
Now everybody knows
who I was and where I stood.

1170
01:05:53,849 --> 01:05:55,840
Hey, it's me.

1171
01:05:57,320 --> 01:06:00,778
Listen, I think somebody
followed me here... home.

1172
01:06:00,823 --> 01:06:03,291
He's outside right now.

1173
01:06:03,326 --> 01:06:07,023
Can you come over or...?

1174
01:06:07,063 --> 01:06:10,123
Just call me back, okay?
All right.

1175
01:06:40,296 --> 01:06:42,662
Don't move.

1176
01:06:55,544 --> 01:06:58,570
- Come on, open up.
- Turk?

1177
01:07:03,819 --> 01:07:05,980
I just called you.

1178
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:07,614
Put the gun down.

1179
01:07:07,656 --> 01:07:09,647
There's a car following me.

1180
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:12,456
Put the gun down.
Put the gun down.

1181
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:17,855
Have you got
something to tell me?

1182
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:19,697
About what?

1183
01:07:19,735 --> 01:07:22,295
Trager, Randall.

1184
01:07:22,338 --> 01:07:24,329
Did you sneak
into my apartment?

1185
01:07:24,373 --> 01:07:26,364
What are they doing
on your computer?

1186
01:07:26,409 --> 01:07:28,639
I was checking
all the links in the case.

1187
01:07:31,981 --> 01:07:33,676
Are you hiding something
from me?

1188
01:07:36,919 --> 01:07:38,477
Huh?

1189
01:07:39,989 --> 01:07:42,856
I just received this... this poem.

1190
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:45,486
A poem?
Not worth mentioning, huh?

1191
01:07:45,528 --> 01:07:48,053
The handwriting
doesn't even match.

1192
01:07:48,097 --> 01:07:50,292
It's a fake.

1193
01:07:50,332 --> 01:07:52,323
Did you write it?

1194
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:56,730
Did you write it?

1195
01:08:00,943 --> 01:08:03,503
What the hell is going on here?

1196
01:08:03,546 --> 01:08:05,707
You're spending a lot of time
with Perez, aren't you?

1197
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:07,613
Yeah, I've been working the case.

1198
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:09,811
What, are you jealous?

1199
01:08:09,852 --> 01:08:12,616
Can I trust you?

1200
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:17,487
- Yes.
- Okay.

1201
01:08:17,526 --> 01:08:19,960
Get me anything and everything
that you can find out

1202
01:08:19,995 --> 01:08:22,429
about Perez or Riley,
what they know about me.

1203
01:08:24,166 --> 01:08:25,997
Everything.

1204
01:08:26,035 --> 01:08:28,503
Karen, don't play me.

1205
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:33,435
I am leaning much further
into saying that it is a cop.

1206
01:08:33,476 --> 01:08:36,809
Tell you what... I'm moving
past the leaning stage

1207
01:08:36,846 --> 01:08:39,644
and I'm moving towards the
l-know-for-sure-it's-a-fucking-cop stage,

1208
01:08:39,682 --> 01:08:42,014
considering how expertly
he shot the shit out of my house.

1209
01:08:42,051 --> 01:08:44,315
Oh my God.
Are you hurt?

1210
01:08:44,353 --> 01:08:46,446
Am I hurt? Am I hurt?
He wants to know if I'm hurt.

1211
01:08:46,489 --> 01:08:48,587
Actually, he's dead.

1212
01:08:50,726 --> 01:08:54,059
- His name is Magulat.
- The guy we saw at Salerno's.

1213
01:08:54,096 --> 01:08:57,156
Yeah, he's in intensive care
at St. Luke's.

1214
01:08:57,199 --> 01:08:59,190
They think he's the guy

1215
01:08:59,235 --> 01:09:01,703
- chopped off Yakov Pearlstein's head.
- What do you think?

1216
01:09:01,737 --> 01:09:03,967
You think he's a victim,
or could he be our suspect?

1217
01:09:04,006 --> 01:09:07,032
I don't know, but either way
I think it's gonna be fun.

1218
01:09:08,077 --> 01:09:10,978
Doctor, what's the story?

1219
01:09:11,013 --> 01:09:14,005
He's one of the toughest human beings
I've ever come into contact with.

1220
01:09:14,049 --> 01:09:15,812
We took six bullets
out of him.

1221
01:09:15,851 --> 01:09:17,716
Six? Whoo!

1222
01:09:17,753 --> 01:09:20,517
Three from the night he was wounded,
three from previous shootings.

1223
01:09:20,556 --> 01:09:22,456
The man is a tank.

1224
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:24,550
Do you mind if I talk to him
a little bit?

1225
01:09:24,593 --> 01:09:27,221
His jaw's wired shut,
but go ahead.

1226
01:09:27,263 --> 01:09:30,164
That's okay. I'll ask the questions.
He can just grunt.

1227
01:09:30,199 --> 01:09:33,134
Hey, Yevgeny.

1228
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:35,399
Wake up.

1229
01:09:35,437 --> 01:09:40,136
That's it. Wake up,
you big fucking grizzly bear.

1230
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:42,576
You don't speak Russian?

1231
01:09:42,611 --> 01:09:46,206
Swoboda. Swoboda. Swoboda.

1232
01:09:46,248 --> 01:09:48,739
Ron.

1233
01:09:53,556 --> 01:09:56,787
I'm thinking this Russian killing machine
could be our first eyewitness.

1234
01:09:59,562 --> 01:10:02,429
Wake up, gugumuck.
You can tell us who did this to you.

1235
01:10:06,669 --> 01:10:10,105
Detective, I think that's enough.

1236
01:10:10,139 --> 01:10:13,597
Then you could tell us where you put
Yakov Pearlstein's head.

1237
01:10:17,012 --> 01:10:19,913
4-3, 4-3, I need a round-the-clock
security detail

1238
01:10:19,949 --> 01:10:24,215
on a patient Magulat,
M-A-gulat,

1239
01:10:24,253 --> 01:10:26,448
St. Luke's in the ICU.

1240
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:32,158
# I wake up in the morning... #

1241
01:10:32,194 --> 01:10:35,459
Is this the number to call
to report a case of police brutality?

1242
01:10:35,497 --> 01:10:38,955
- Cat got your tongue?
- Out on bail again?

1243
01:10:39,001 --> 01:10:41,265
What, you think you can scare me,
little bitch? What do you want?

1244
01:10:41,303 --> 01:10:43,635
Be careful, Detective.
My taxes pay your salary.

1245
01:10:43,672 --> 01:10:46,266
You don't pay any fucking taxes,
you lowlife piece of shit.

1246
01:10:46,308 --> 01:10:48,674
- Get to the point, come on.
- One of your vics, Trager,

1247
01:10:48,711 --> 01:10:51,339
stole a whole lot of guns
down South.

1248
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:53,473
Same guns are turning up
on your murder scenes.

1249
01:10:53,515 --> 01:10:54,812
So it's simple...

1250
01:10:54,850 --> 01:10:57,375
find stolen guns,
you got your guy.

1251
01:10:57,419 --> 01:10:59,250
So you know the guy?

1252
01:10:59,288 --> 01:11:02,086
Do you know if there's a cop out there
who might be a danger to the public?

1253
01:11:02,124 --> 01:11:04,888
I couldn't live with myself
if I just stood by and didn't say anything.

1254
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:07,919
Look, I'm gonna give you
two seconds more. Give me yes or no.

1255
01:11:07,963 --> 01:11:10,898
Do you know the guy?
And when do I meet you to talk about it?

1256
01:11:10,933 --> 01:11:13,663
Friday, 9:00 PM, at my club.

1257
01:11:13,702 --> 01:11:14,862
I'll be there.

1258
01:11:14,903 --> 01:11:16,928
Man, there's dumb
and there's dumber,

1259
01:11:16,972 --> 01:11:19,440
but this is the motherfucking dumbest
right here, man.

1260
01:11:19,475 --> 01:11:21,636
Easy, son, easy.
It's gonna be easy for you.

1261
01:11:21,677 --> 01:11:25,272
All you gotta do is be bait, that's all.
Be a little sardine for us, all right?

1262
01:11:25,314 --> 01:11:27,976
You help us... we got you covered.
Your club doesn't get hassled

1263
01:11:28,017 --> 01:11:30,542
and you don't have a revolving door
in and out of jail.

1264
01:11:30,586 --> 01:11:32,178
Do we have a deal or not?

1265
01:11:32,221 --> 01:11:35,622
Yeah, but your boy come in here
and go Hannibal Lecter on my ass,

1266
01:11:35,658 --> 01:11:38,183
I don't want no Jodie fucking Foster
coming through the door.

1267
01:11:38,227 --> 01:11:40,058
I want the goddamn
Marine Corps, man.

1268
01:11:40,095 --> 01:11:43,724
# Since Color Me Badd was singing
"I wanna sex you up"...#

1269
01:12:12,761 --> 01:12:14,251
Evening, Detective.

1270
01:12:14,296 --> 01:12:17,513
You want one? It's shit,
but it's better than nothing, right?

1271
01:12:17,548 --> 01:12:20,730
As soon as I heard
the fucking Russian didn't die

1272
01:12:20,769 --> 01:12:23,033
I knew things would never
be the same.

1273
01:12:23,072 --> 01:12:25,233
I had to change the rules,

1274
01:12:25,274 --> 01:12:27,265
the strategy.

1275
01:12:27,309 --> 01:12:31,075
I had to be bold, do something
that could never be undone.

1276
01:12:38,921 --> 01:12:41,223
I went for the unforgivable.

1277
01:13:08,317 --> 01:13:11,013
No. Please. No.

1278
01:13:33,041 --> 01:13:35,908
Did you hear
anything I just said?

1279
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:40,810
How exactly could I be
blowing this out of proportion?

1280
01:13:40,849 --> 01:13:43,010
That psycho just assaulted me.

1281
01:13:43,051 --> 01:13:46,350
I am telling you
he is a classic sociopath.

1282
01:13:46,388 --> 01:13:48,515
Okay okay,
I'll look into it, all right?

1283
01:13:48,557 --> 01:13:50,047
I'll look into it.

1284
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:52,253
You stay the hell away from here.
Understood?

1285
01:13:52,294 --> 01:13:54,091
Understood?

1286
01:13:56,165 --> 01:13:57,496
Fuck that.

1287
01:14:08,911 --> 01:14:11,209
Check the ball,
check the ball.

1288
01:14:12,714 --> 01:14:14,329
I got the ball. I got the ball.
I got the ball.

1289
01:14:14,330 --> 01:14:15,945
Stay on him.
Stay on him.

1290
01:14:15,984 --> 01:14:17,918
Excuse me,
I'm Detective Corelli.

1291
01:14:17,953 --> 01:14:20,888
- I need to see your reservation book.
- Sure. Help yourself.

1292
01:14:28,330 --> 01:14:30,560
- Thank you.
- Anytime.

1293
01:14:30,599 --> 01:14:32,294
Yes, this is Detective Corelli.

1294
01:14:32,334 --> 01:14:34,768
I've been trying to reach
Detectives Perez and Riley

1295
01:14:34,803 --> 01:14:36,737
and I can't seem
to locate them.

1296
01:14:36,772 --> 01:14:39,764
- I like to party.
- That's nothing. I was into Kiss.

1297
01:14:39,808 --> 01:14:41,799
I used to run
around the house

1298
01:14:41,844 --> 01:14:43,971
with my tongue hanging out,
spitting fake blood.

1299
01:14:44,012 --> 01:14:45,309
I need to speak to them
urgently.

1300
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:52,552
Yes, I understand,
but I need the location, please.

1301
01:15:21,116 --> 01:15:23,607
Hey, he's here.

1302
01:15:23,652 --> 01:15:24,846
Let me in.

1303
01:15:30,325 --> 01:15:32,622
Thank God it's the police.

1304
01:15:32,661 --> 01:15:34,993
Yeah, so where do we go?

1305
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:36,964
Follow me.

1306
01:15:36,999 --> 01:15:39,297
I used to play ball
a couple of blocks from here.

1307
01:15:39,334 --> 01:15:40,562
Get the fuck out of here.

1308
01:15:40,602 --> 01:15:43,537
When I was a kid I wasn't afraid
to mix it up with guys like you.

1309
01:15:43,572 --> 01:15:44,869
You still ain't.

1310
01:15:44,907 --> 01:15:47,432
Yeah, nowadays
I carry a gun with me.

1311
01:15:47,476 --> 01:15:50,741
It's a bad neighborhood.

1312
01:15:50,779 --> 01:15:52,770
- It ain't bad for me.
- Yeah, well...

1313
01:15:52,814 --> 01:15:55,214
Yeah, he's inside.

1314
01:15:55,250 --> 01:15:56,808
Well, so far so good.

1315
01:15:56,852 --> 01:15:59,446
So now that we're done with
the pleasantries, what do you got for me?

1316
01:15:59,488 --> 01:16:00,716
He's talking.

1317
01:16:00,756 --> 01:16:02,747
- What did you think he was gonna do?
- How about an apology?

1318
01:16:02,791 --> 01:16:05,555
The shit that happened to Stubby,
that wasn't supposed to happen.

1319
01:16:05,594 --> 01:16:07,357
Lieutenant,
that's a crock of shit.

1320
01:16:07,358 --> 01:16:09,121
I lost three fucking teeth that day.

1321
01:16:09,164 --> 01:16:11,428
He's not a civilian.
He's a fucking dealer.

1322
01:16:11,466 --> 01:16:13,525
- And I kept my mouth shut.
- So what?

1323
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:16,868
You guys love those stupid gold teeth.
You should thank me.

1324
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:19,738
Well, he's wearing a vest
and Starsky and Hutch here

1325
01:16:19,775 --> 01:16:22,801
are watching him like a couple
of hawks... gay hawks.

1326
01:16:22,844 --> 01:16:26,007
Yeah, right there, buddy.

1327
01:16:26,048 --> 01:16:29,017
All right, enough bullshit.
So you know our poetry boy?

1328
01:16:29,051 --> 01:16:31,042
Just talk to me.
What do you got for me?

1329
01:16:31,086 --> 01:16:33,145
- All right, here we go.
- Here we go.

1330
01:16:33,188 --> 01:16:34,655
Would you please?

1331
01:16:34,690 --> 01:16:37,523
Just 'cause the guy's talking tough,
that don't mean shit.

1332
01:16:37,559 --> 01:16:39,356
Let me ask you something,
Copernicus.

1333
01:16:39,394 --> 01:16:41,988
That gun on his belt...
do you think it's a service pistol?

1334
01:16:42,030 --> 01:16:44,692
I bet you we'll trace it back to Trager's.
What do you think about that?

1335
01:16:44,733 --> 01:16:46,462
- What do you want to bet?
- 500 bucks.

1336
01:16:46,501 --> 01:16:48,628
- You're on.
- I'm in for another five.

1337
01:16:48,670 --> 01:16:51,036
Oh, this is fun.

1338
01:16:51,073 --> 01:16:53,268
Look, I help you,
you reciprocate.

1339
01:16:53,308 --> 01:16:54,775
So help me.

1340
01:16:54,810 --> 01:16:57,108
All right, you might see
a little bit of a cell-phone video.

1341
01:16:57,145 --> 01:16:59,204
I got it in front of Trager's
the night he bought it.

1342
01:16:59,247 --> 01:17:01,181
- You got what?
- I got a movie...

1343
01:17:01,216 --> 01:17:04,708
a couple of kids back from the prom,
preserving their special memories,

1344
01:17:04,753 --> 01:17:06,448
a positive ID of you, big time.

1345
01:17:06,488 --> 01:17:08,649
- Oh, yeah? Of me?
- Yeah.

1346
01:17:08,690 --> 01:17:10,419
Okay.

1347
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:11,983
Now you know
what I'm talking about.

1348
01:17:12,027 --> 01:17:14,393
Yeah, now I got it.

1349
01:17:14,429 --> 01:17:16,363
Yeah, well,
so how do I look?

1350
01:17:19,434 --> 01:17:20,992
Like a poet?

1351
01:17:22,004 --> 01:17:23,665
'Cause that's what I am,
you know, a poet.

1352
01:17:23,705 --> 01:17:26,401
All right, come on, let's go.

1353
01:17:26,441 --> 01:17:29,069
In fact, I wrote a poem for you, Spider.
Want to hear it?

1354
01:17:29,111 --> 01:17:31,045
Eh?

1355
01:17:34,916 --> 01:17:38,408
Drop your gun right now, motherfucker!
Drop to the ground right now!

1356
01:17:38,453 --> 01:17:40,284
Oh! Oh! Grease me up and...

1357
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:42,381
I mean, do they actually pay
you two morons?

1358
01:17:42,424 --> 01:17:45,689
- Put the fucking weapon on the ground.
- Gladly. Gladly. Right there.

1359
01:17:45,727 --> 01:17:47,695
Right there. There you go.

1360
01:17:48,864 --> 01:17:50,764
Hey, you want to read my poem?

1361
01:17:50,799 --> 01:17:52,232
Easy easy.

1362
01:17:52,267 --> 01:17:53,564
Here, read it.

1363
01:17:55,737 --> 01:17:58,001
"You tried to set me up, you fucks,

1364
01:17:58,040 --> 01:17:59,837
And this is how you do it?

1365
01:17:59,875 --> 01:18:02,605
You thought I'd get
my dick cut off,

1366
01:18:02,644 --> 01:18:05,204
Instead you only blew it."

1367
01:18:05,247 --> 01:18:07,272
Great stuff.

1368
01:18:07,315 --> 01:18:09,681
- What is that shit?
- Thank you.

1369
01:18:09,718 --> 01:18:12,152
That is poetry.

1370
01:18:12,187 --> 01:18:13,916
What are you doing here?

1371
01:18:13,955 --> 01:18:15,786
Well, don't look at me, partner,

1372
01:18:15,824 --> 01:18:18,315
but I tagged along
to protect your ass

1373
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:21,693
and to see the look on their faces.
It was worth it.

1374
01:18:21,730 --> 01:18:24,096
We're doing our jobs here, okay?
I'm not gonna apologize for that.

1375
01:18:24,132 --> 01:18:26,760
I never want you to apologize, Teddy.
There's a killer out there with a badge.

1376
01:18:26,802 --> 01:18:28,963
- What are you morons doing about it?
- What do you think we're doing here?

1377
01:18:29,004 --> 01:18:30,869
- That's not it.
- No, that's not it.

1378
01:18:30,906 --> 01:18:32,806
I just made 1000 bucks.

1379
01:18:32,841 --> 01:18:34,706
Where's the other gun?
Give it to me.

1380
01:18:34,743 --> 01:18:36,540
Why don't you frisk me, Sherlock?
Go ahead.

1381
01:18:36,578 --> 01:18:38,773
- Frisk me, go ahead. Go ahead.
- Yeah, I'm gonna frisk you.

1382
01:18:41,850 --> 01:18:44,512
Ooh, nice touch, Mary.

1383
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:46,714
What are you doing after work?
Unless you're committed.

1384
01:18:46,755 --> 01:18:48,985
I don't want to get
in the middle of anything.

1385
01:18:49,024 --> 01:18:50,639
What happened to your face?

1386
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:52,255
Your mick friend give
you a little love bite?

1387
01:18:52,294 --> 01:18:55,661
- Shut the fuck up. Shut your fucking face.
- Hey hey hey! Whoa!

1388
01:18:55,697 --> 01:18:58,427
I'll blow your brains out
if you don't get the fuck away.

1389
01:18:58,467 --> 01:19:00,628
What's he talking about?

1390
01:19:00,669 --> 01:19:02,466
- What's he talking about?
- What he's talking about is,

1391
01:19:02,504 --> 01:19:04,836
just 'cause you didn't go for this
doesn't mean you're not our guy.

1392
01:19:04,873 --> 01:19:07,239
- Now we gotta break this shit up.
- Don't translate for me, man.

1393
01:19:07,275 --> 01:19:09,903
Will you let this go?
You fucked up, okay?

1394
01:19:09,945 --> 01:19:12,470
- We fucked up 'cause you helped him.
- I'm gonna nail your ass.

1395
01:19:12,514 --> 01:19:14,880
I'm not through with you, man.
Make a mistake.

1396
01:19:14,916 --> 01:19:16,907
I'm gonna
break this stuff down, okay?

1397
01:19:16,952 --> 01:19:19,182
You fucking dog.

1398
01:19:20,722 --> 01:19:23,486
Relax, Spider.

1399
01:19:23,525 --> 01:19:25,857
Come on, let's have a drink.

1400
01:19:25,894 --> 01:19:29,455
I saw what I think
is a refrigerator here.

1401
01:19:33,668 --> 01:19:35,329
I'll be back in a second.

1402
01:19:44,279 --> 01:19:45,769
Hey, muffinhead.

1403
01:19:48,984 --> 01:19:50,451
Is this the person
who shot you?

1404
01:19:51,453 --> 01:19:53,387
You're sure?

1405
01:19:59,127 --> 01:20:01,152
No, you're the pumpkinhead.

1406
01:20:12,407 --> 01:20:14,375
You miss me?

1407
01:20:16,411 --> 01:20:18,743
"...of death and pain,

1408
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:20,941
Place oneself among the slain.

1409
01:20:20,982 --> 01:20:23,507
If one addiction goes unfed,

1410
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:25,850
The world is better with him dead."

1411
01:20:44,439 --> 01:20:45,667
Take it easy.

1412
01:20:45,707 --> 01:20:47,470
It's okay.
It's gonna be all right.

1413
01:20:47,509 --> 01:20:49,739
Jesus Christ, Rooster.

1414
01:20:49,778 --> 01:20:52,645
Just move into the room. Here.

1415
01:20:52,681 --> 01:20:55,149
Sit down. Sit down.

1416
01:20:58,053 --> 01:21:00,044
Okay.

1417
01:21:00,088 --> 01:21:03,785
You gotta know about this,
Tom, from me.

1418
01:21:03,825 --> 01:21:06,919
Now just open that little book,
start reading.

1419
01:21:06,962 --> 01:21:09,430
Everything you want to know
is in there.

1420
01:21:11,466 --> 01:21:13,457
So go ahead.

1421
01:21:15,036 --> 01:21:17,027
Out loud.

1422
01:21:18,373 --> 01:21:20,466
For the record.

1423
01:21:20,508 --> 01:21:23,272
See the little video here?

1424
01:21:29,684 --> 01:21:33,051
"My name is David Fisk,
Detective First Grade.

1425
01:21:33,088 --> 01:21:37,149
I've been a cop in the NYPD
for nearly 30 years."

1426
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:41,787
- Dave, Dave, Dave, Dave.
- Tom,

1427
01:21:41,830 --> 01:21:44,924
we've got a lot to cover
and not much time to do it in, so...

1428
01:21:48,203 --> 01:21:51,400
"My name is David Fisk,
Detective First Grade."

1429
01:21:51,439 --> 01:21:53,964
My name is David Fisk.

1430
01:21:54,009 --> 01:21:57,035
"I've been a cop in the NYPD
for nearly 30 years."

1431
01:21:57,078 --> 01:21:59,945
I don't expect you
to remember me.

1432
01:21:59,981 --> 01:22:02,006
I mean, it's been a long time

1433
01:22:02,050 --> 01:22:05,850
since you sat me on your lap
and told me you loved me.

1434
01:22:05,887 --> 01:22:08,947
"In that time

1435
01:22:08,990 --> 01:22:11,720
I've killed 14 people."

1436
01:22:12,827 --> 01:22:14,818
But I guarantee

1437
01:22:14,863 --> 01:22:18,026
you're gonna remember the name
for the rest of your life.

1438
01:22:28,543 --> 01:22:32,138
"You don't become a cop
because you want to serve and protect.

1439
01:22:33,581 --> 01:22:36,641
You join the force because they let you
carry a gun and a badge.

1440
01:22:36,685 --> 01:22:39,347
Most people respect the badge.

1441
01:22:39,387 --> 01:22:41,480
Everybody respects the gun."

1442
01:22:41,523 --> 01:22:44,356
I'm the killer.
I show up at your door.

1443
01:22:44,392 --> 01:22:47,225
What are you talking about?
It's not a fucking chess game.

1444
01:22:47,262 --> 01:22:50,356
Who knows? Maybe it is.
You're making all the wrong moves.

1445
01:22:50,398 --> 01:22:52,593
I'm gonna put two
through his fucking head

1446
01:22:52,634 --> 01:22:54,966
myself.

1447
01:22:55,003 --> 01:22:57,164
I know it to a moral certainty.

1448
01:22:57,205 --> 01:22:59,730
You sort of get numb to it.

1449
01:23:09,284 --> 01:23:12,014
"Tom Cowen was my role model.

1450
01:23:22,097 --> 01:23:24,395
The day I stopped trying to be him

1451
01:23:24,432 --> 01:23:26,764
was the greatest day of my life.

1452
01:23:30,805 --> 01:23:34,104
Several years back I framed
a lowlife child killer

1453
01:23:34,142 --> 01:23:36,804
named Charles Randall.

1454
01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:40,980
I should have known
it would come back to haunt me."

1455
01:23:45,186 --> 01:23:47,552
What do you want me
to do with this?

1456
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:51,791
Is that all you got to say?

1457
01:23:51,826 --> 01:23:54,056
I owe you this explanation, pal.

1458
01:23:54,095 --> 01:23:56,120
Why are you telling me now?

1459
01:23:56,164 --> 01:24:00,498
Ivan the Terrible
is gonna wake up pretty soon

1460
01:24:00,535 --> 01:24:02,332
and he's gonna ID me.

1461
01:24:07,909 --> 01:24:09,740
Evening, Detective.

1462
01:24:09,778 --> 01:24:12,747
You want one? It's shit,
but it's better than nothing, right?

1463
01:24:12,781 --> 01:24:16,945
I can just walk right in here.
Your partner's asleep. Step outside.

1464
01:24:16,985 --> 01:24:19,818
Did I ever pick
the wrong fucking Russki to shoot?

1465
01:24:29,197 --> 01:24:31,597
Now we're going off the record.

1466
01:24:34,135 --> 01:24:37,935
Uh, I'm going to take the rap
for the Randall gun thing.

1467
01:24:37,972 --> 01:24:39,803
You saw that.

1468
01:24:39,841 --> 01:24:43,004
I mean, considering
the circumstances, why not?

1469
01:24:43,044 --> 01:24:45,512
No need to thank me.

1470
01:24:46,714 --> 01:24:48,648
That business about not being me...

1471
01:24:48,683 --> 01:24:50,173
Yeah.

1472
01:24:50,218 --> 01:24:52,186
I don't get that.

1473
01:24:52,220 --> 01:24:56,213
Well, you're a great cop, Tom.

1474
01:24:56,257 --> 01:24:58,248
I mean, you were the one

1475
01:24:58,293 --> 01:25:01,353
I aspired to all my life
and could never be.

1476
01:25:02,931 --> 01:25:05,331
Then you broke the law,

1477
01:25:05,366 --> 01:25:08,529
planted the gun on Randall,

1478
01:25:08,570 --> 01:25:11,835
let me down.

1479
01:25:13,575 --> 01:25:15,509
I lost my faith.

1480
01:25:17,078 --> 01:25:21,037
That's when it all started.

1481
01:25:21,082 --> 01:25:23,744
And once it did,

1482
01:25:23,785 --> 01:25:25,810
I couldn't stop.

1483
01:25:27,188 --> 01:25:30,885
Finally,

1484
01:25:30,925 --> 01:25:33,416
I didn't want to.

1485
01:25:39,834 --> 01:25:43,395
So I did my own thing.

1486
01:25:43,438 --> 01:25:46,032
And you know what? In the end

1487
01:25:46,074 --> 01:25:48,372
it got done.

1488
01:25:48,409 --> 01:25:50,934
The scum went down.

1489
01:25:50,979 --> 01:25:52,844
And that's it. That's that.

1490
01:25:54,382 --> 01:25:56,680
I don't understand
a word you said,

1491
01:25:56,718 --> 01:25:58,879
- don't understand any of it.
- I know you don't, Tom.

1492
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:01,616
As soon as I heard
the Russian didn't die

1493
01:26:01,656 --> 01:26:04,022
I knew I had to change the rules,

1494
01:26:04,058 --> 01:26:06,891
do something that could
never be undone.

1495
01:26:06,928 --> 01:26:08,987
I went for the unforgivable.

1496
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:14,224
No.

1497
01:26:15,703 --> 01:26:17,967
So what am I gonna do, my friend,

1498
01:26:18,006 --> 01:26:20,634
partner? Arrest you?

1499
01:26:20,675 --> 01:26:23,542
At some point I gotta call it in.

1500
01:26:23,578 --> 01:26:24,977
We're a team.

1501
01:26:25,013 --> 01:26:26,708
We were.

1502
01:26:26,748 --> 01:26:28,739
Yeah, we were, a great team.

1503
01:26:28,783 --> 01:26:31,274
That was yesterday, Dave.

1504
01:26:31,319 --> 01:26:32,445
Today...

1505
01:26:34,556 --> 01:26:37,525
today you're pointing a gun at me.

1506
01:26:41,963 --> 01:26:45,091
But it hasn't gone off yet.

1507
01:26:50,471 --> 01:26:51,961
Bye, Tom.

1508
01:26:52,006 --> 01:26:54,099
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.

1509
01:26:54,142 --> 01:26:57,145
To hell, I suppose.

1510
01:27:43,825 --> 01:27:45,850
- Hey, Dave, Dave.
- Whoa.

1511
01:27:45,893 --> 01:27:48,453
Don't come closer!

1512
01:27:48,496 --> 01:27:50,828
- You wouldn't.
- You want to bet your life on it?

1513
01:27:50,865 --> 01:27:52,833
Come on, partner, I know you.
You wouldn't.

1514
01:27:52,867 --> 01:27:55,233
But I would.

1515
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:56,498
Oh.

1516
01:27:56,537 --> 01:27:58,528
Karen, just take it easy.

1517
01:27:58,573 --> 01:28:00,598
- Can't get me out of your mind?
- Shut up, Dave.

1518
01:28:00,642 --> 01:28:04,669
You're gonna defend
this lowlife piece of shit?

1519
01:28:04,712 --> 01:28:07,647
- Boy, I'm in your head.
- I'm not defending him. Take it easy.

1520
01:28:07,682 --> 01:28:10,845
Fuck you, Turk.
Put the gun down, Fisk.

1521
01:28:10,885 --> 01:28:12,352
- And if I don't?
- Dave.

1522
01:28:12,387 --> 01:28:15,151
- How about I blow your brains out?
- Ooh, I like the sound of that.

1523
01:28:15,189 --> 01:28:17,123
- Don't move.
- Karen.

1524
01:28:17,158 --> 01:28:19,558
You blow me away, Turk dies.
Is that your idea?

1525
01:28:19,594 --> 01:28:20,925
I said don't move, you prick.

1526
01:28:20,962 --> 01:28:23,260
Bye-bye!

1527
01:28:24,932 --> 01:28:26,524
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun.

1528
01:28:28,202 --> 01:28:29,897
Stay here.

1529
01:28:36,678 --> 01:28:38,077
Oh, man.

1530
01:28:39,414 --> 01:28:40,676
Fuck.

1531
01:28:42,216 --> 01:28:44,116
These old locks...

1532
01:28:44,152 --> 01:28:45,847
I mean, they're good.

1533
01:28:45,887 --> 01:28:47,855
Dave, you've got to end
this thing.

1534
01:28:47,889 --> 01:28:49,948
End it?

1535
01:28:49,991 --> 01:28:51,288
Put the gun down.

1536
01:28:51,326 --> 01:28:54,124
What's your plan?

1537
01:28:54,162 --> 01:28:56,460
Are you gonna arrest me?

1538
01:28:56,497 --> 01:28:59,330
Are you gonna take me down
to the precinct, book me,

1539
01:28:59,367 --> 01:29:03,030
fingerprint me,
body-cavity-search me?

1540
01:29:03,071 --> 01:29:04,936
What the fuck
are you gonna do?

1541
01:29:04,972 --> 01:29:07,907
wheel me out on the "Geraldo" show,
a freak of the week?

1542
01:29:07,942 --> 01:29:12,641
Or better yet, an in-depth
psycho profile on "Oprah"?

1543
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:14,978
Are you ready for that?
It ain't gonna fly, man.

1544
01:29:15,016 --> 01:29:17,382
Dave, you give me no choice.

1545
01:29:17,418 --> 01:29:19,249
You got a choice... I escape.

1546
01:29:20,822 --> 01:29:23,086
Would you do that for me, Tom?

1547
01:29:24,192 --> 01:29:25,420
Would you let me escape?

1548
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:26,984
Come on, don't do this.

1549
01:29:27,028 --> 01:29:29,360
I'm gonna make a run for it.

1550
01:29:29,397 --> 01:29:31,592
What do you think?

1551
01:29:31,632 --> 01:29:34,624
You gotta do the right thing.

1552
01:29:40,641 --> 01:29:42,700
That's a 10-10, partner...

1553
01:29:42,744 --> 01:29:46,111
shots fired, suspect fleeing.
Let's go!

1554
01:29:46,147 --> 01:29:47,774
Come on, don't go there.

1555
01:29:49,283 --> 01:29:52,343
Hey, partner, come on.
Shots fired.

1556
01:29:52,387 --> 01:29:54,821
- Don't do this.
- Suspect fleeing,

1557
01:29:54,856 --> 01:29:57,290
resisting arrest. Come on.

1558
01:30:06,701 --> 01:30:09,602
A righteous man

1559
01:30:09,637 --> 01:30:12,367
Before me stands,

1560
01:30:12,407 --> 01:30:16,776
A hero in these filthy lands.

1561
01:30:16,811 --> 01:30:20,212
A brother in arms,

1562
01:30:20,248 --> 01:30:23,706
In heart are you.

1563
01:30:23,751 --> 01:30:26,413
I was really hoping

1564
01:30:26,454 --> 01:30:29,116
You'd get it too.

1565
01:30:32,593 --> 01:30:35,153
- I do get it.
- No, you don't.

1566
01:30:35,196 --> 01:30:37,130
No, I get it.

1567
01:30:43,471 --> 01:30:46,736
You know, the only thing
in this life

1568
01:30:46,774 --> 01:30:49,607
that ever gave me
any satisfaction

1569
01:30:49,644 --> 01:30:51,544
was killing those fucks.

1570
01:30:53,481 --> 01:30:55,813
So this is for real.

1571
01:30:55,850 --> 01:30:58,216
I mean,

1572
01:30:58,252 --> 01:31:00,584
this one is bad.

1573
01:31:02,757 --> 01:31:04,384
10-13.

1574
01:31:05,393 --> 01:31:07,588
Officer down.

1575
01:31:31,219 --> 01:31:34,279
I ain't going anywhere, Tom.

1576
01:31:34,322 --> 01:31:36,620
I ain't going anywhere.

1577
01:31:37,758 --> 01:31:40,591
It's okay.

1578
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:48,630
3-4 squad, Central.
3-4 squad, Central.

1579
01:31:48,669 --> 01:31:51,160
10-13, officer down.
184th and St. Nick's.

1580
01:31:51,205 --> 01:31:53,935
Officer down, 10-13.
Hurry hurry hurry.

1581
01:31:53,975 --> 01:31:56,637
- 10-4, 4 squad...
- Tom, don't. Don't.

1582
01:31:56,677 --> 01:32:00,238
- Officer down. ETA six minutes.
- Don't.

1583
01:32:00,281 --> 01:32:02,909
Don't.

1584
01:32:15,129 --> 01:32:17,154
Don't.

1585
01:32:25,606 --> 01:32:27,699
3-4 squad, Central.

1586
01:32:27,742 --> 01:32:30,336
Central.
Go ahead, 4 squad.

1587
01:32:30,378 --> 01:32:32,903
That's a 10-55 on the bus.
Cancel the ambulance.

1588
01:32:32,947 --> 01:32:34,938
10-5?

1589
01:32:34,982 --> 01:32:38,042
Cancel the ambulance.
10-55 on the bus. Cancel the ambulance.

1590
01:32:38,085 --> 01:32:40,747
- You sure on that?
- Sure on that.

1591
01:32:49,897 --> 01:32:52,263
You did this, you know.

1592
01:32:53,834 --> 01:32:57,292
I know, partner, I know.

1593
01:33:00,441 --> 01:33:02,272
We did good, Tom.

1594
01:33:03,511 --> 01:33:05,945
Tom, Tommy.

1595
01:33:05,980 --> 01:33:09,711
We did good. We did good.

1596
01:33:11,419 --> 01:33:14,149
You're a good man, Tom.

1597
01:33:14,188 --> 01:33:16,622
You're a good man.

1598
01:33:17,992 --> 01:33:21,018
I wish you...

1599
01:33:21,062 --> 01:33:23,360
I wish you

1600
01:33:23,397 --> 01:33:26,491
continued success.

1601
01:34:08,209 --> 01:34:10,370
Some piece of work, your partner.

1602
01:34:10,411 --> 01:34:12,402
Lights.

1603
01:34:12,446 --> 01:34:14,243
Look, Cowen,

1604
01:34:14,281 --> 01:34:16,943
the way we see it,

1605
01:34:16,984 --> 01:34:19,953
Detective Fisk just closed the door
on the poetry boy.

1606
01:34:26,894 --> 01:34:30,057
Good. Whatever you say.

1607
01:34:32,900 --> 01:34:35,368
Are we done?

1608
01:34:35,403 --> 01:34:37,428
Yeah, we're done.

1609
01:34:59,527 --> 01:35:01,358
My daughter called.

1610
01:35:01,395 --> 01:35:05,058
She was upset about Rooster
and worried about me.

1611
01:35:05,099 --> 01:35:08,660
She asked me if I was likely
to do something stupid

1612
01:35:08,703 --> 01:35:11,263
and I said, "Like what,

1613
01:35:11,305 --> 01:35:14,331
take anger management classes
or retire?"

1614
01:35:14,375 --> 01:35:17,640
I said I was gonna do
the same old thing I always do.

1615
01:35:17,678 --> 01:35:21,580
She said, "Good.
What else could you do?"

1616
01:35:21,615 --> 01:35:23,276
I said, "Right."

1617
01:35:23,317 --> 01:35:26,343
A real chip off the old block,
my daughter.

1618
01:35:26,387 --> 01:35:29,618
She said I was a cop
and a good one.

1619
01:35:29,657 --> 01:35:33,218
Funny... Rooster said
the same thing.

1620
01:35:36,330 --> 01:35:39,595
Okay, guys,
let's get ready to play ball.

1621
01:35:39,633 --> 01:35:43,467
On the count of three.
Everybody in?

1622
01:35:43,504 --> 01:35:47,065
One, two, three, explosion!

1623
01:38:01,752 --> 01:38:02,753
