1
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,061
One!

2
00:01:22,251 --> 00:01:23,892
Three the eyes!

3
00:01:24,663 --> 00:01:26,227
Two!

4
00:01:26,332 --> 00:01:27,702
Between the eyes

5
00:01:57,836 --> 00:01:58,627
Out!

6
00:01:58,732 --> 00:01:59,358
What?!

7
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,359
- She's safe.
- She was out.

8
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,445
She landed right there, she's safe.

9
00:02:09,858 --> 00:02:12,604
Ah, come on. That's enough,
I don't wanna hear another word.

10
00:02:14,473 --> 00:02:15,730
- Foul OUT!
- Calm Down.

11
00:02:22,738 --> 00:02:25,574
My grandmother just takes me to the
Wash Square Park.

12
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,494
I watched Bobby Fischer played
ten games at the same time.

13
00:02:31,538 --> 00:02:32,581
Queen me

14
00:02:32,671 --> 00:02:35,262
He made five, six moves ahead on each table.

15
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,729
Anyway, he became World Champ, Didn't he?

16
00:02:40,025 --> 00:02:41,168
Then lost his fucking mind.

17
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:49,317
Became a revin paranoid,
being attacked on more direction.

18
00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:51,575
He couldn't see a reason for them.

19
00:02:58,286 --> 00:02:59,275
Mate!

20
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:02,016
Mate!

21
00:03:31,205 --> 00:03:33,308
My name is David Fisk.

22
00:03:33,969 --> 00:03:40,654
Detective 1st Grade
I've been a cop in NYPD for over 30 years.

23
00:03:41,348 --> 00:03:42,633
in that time

24
00:03:45,203 --> 00:03:47,155
I've killed fourteen people.

25
00:03:49,304 --> 00:03:50,998
Relive that one more time.

26
00:03:52,335 --> 00:03:54,107
I've killed fourteen people.

27
00:03:55,167 --> 00:03:56,100
He's nuts.

28
00:03:59,729 --> 00:04:01,359
When these things started...

29
00:04:05,747 --> 00:04:06,966
How did they start...

30
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:15,507
Maybe this one started with
this guy named Charles Randall.

31
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,072
Randall was a child killer.

32
00:04:26,121 --> 00:04:29,820
He killed his girlfriend's daughter
about four years ago.

33
00:04:32,388 --> 00:04:33,379
AssHole.

34
00:04:35,736 --> 00:04:39,166
He was tried for his crime but was
acquited by jury for his spouse.

35
00:04:54,777 --> 00:04:56,993
My partner and I found this unacceptable.

36
00:05:01,803 --> 00:05:03,924
My partner is a good man.

37
00:05:25,432 --> 00:05:27,336
Are you really going to do this thing?

38
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:29,836
Do what?

39
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:32,018
You're gonna take down Randall.

40
00:05:32,364 --> 00:05:34,930
For home society he didn't commit.

41
00:05:39,374 --> 00:05:41,293
What am I gonna do?

42
00:05:41,698 --> 00:05:43,702
You are my partner.

43
00:05:43,723 --> 00:05:45,514
You are my role model.

44
00:05:45,586 --> 00:05:47,833
- Right.
- What am I gonna do without role model?

45
00:05:51,586 --> 00:05:53,913
We didn't have this conversation.

46
00:05:54,885 --> 00:05:56,388
What conversation.

47
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:17,448
I got it done.

48
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,663
Randall lost his freedom.

49
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,581
For the crime he didn't commit.

50
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:35,673
I lost my faith.

51
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,941
- I wanna go.
- OK

52
00:06:50,668 --> 00:06:53,324
You can take this as a confession,
if you want.

53
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,794
Whatever.

54
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,346
A few weeks ago, things heated up.

55
00:06:58,410 --> 00:06:59,684
What we got on them, Turk?

56
00:07:00,684 --> 00:07:07,452
Mark Smith, As Known As "Spider"
big drug dealer, murders, extortion, lots of nice things.

57
00:07:07,501 --> 00:07:10,996
Converted this old Banner Bank
to a Club 404 Harlem.

58
00:07:11,953 --> 00:07:13,987
Maybe when he sees us so confess.

59
00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:15,551
What, You don't believe the miracles?

60
00:07:15,707 --> 00:07:19,418
You picked up a check one day, one day,
then I blelieve the miracles.

61
00:07:19,498 --> 00:07:22,808
- Let's go, I'm buying.
- Yeah, that's the miracle I want some.

62
00:07:39,808 --> 00:07:44,650
- This is where he launder his money.
- Oh yeah. Cleaning, Clean, Clean.

63
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:47,996
Clean all his mess.

64
00:07:49,175 --> 00:07:50,432
I gotta take a leak.

65
00:08:01,093 --> 00:08:04,656
I'll just be in a sec,
I'm not peeking.

66
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:05,728
No problem.

67
00:08:10,421 --> 00:08:12,089
You guys are so lucky.

68
00:08:12,874 --> 00:08:13,724
What is that?

69
00:08:13,829 --> 00:08:16,019
No line to the bathroom, and...

70
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,357
You guys pee standing up.

71
00:08:20,401 --> 00:08:24,259
And zip, ..., zip...
by the boom by the wing get out here.

72
00:08:25,848 --> 00:08:28,760
The big I really deal with myself on this thing.

73
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:30,387
You want a bump?

74
00:08:30,901 --> 00:08:32,001
Where's your that from?

75
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:35,154
Spider, it's prima.

76
00:09:43,568 --> 00:09:44,539
Not bad.

77
00:09:45,113 --> 00:09:46,452
Not bad?

78
00:09:46,598 --> 00:09:47,779
What fuck are you looking for?

79
00:09:49,569 --> 00:09:52,960
Come on, Turk, you pulled my hair.

80
00:09:53,669 --> 00:09:56,353
My little sister used to pull
my hair harder than that.

81
00:09:56,577 --> 00:09:57,655
Whatever.

82
00:10:02,256 --> 00:10:02,774
I gotta go.

83
00:10:14,818 --> 00:10:16,194
Where the fuck you going?

84
00:10:16,203 --> 00:10:17,236
I'm going to retire.

85
00:10:17,237 --> 00:10:17,967
Ritire?

86
00:10:18,177 --> 00:10:19,845
This is America. You winy bitch.

87
00:10:19,932 --> 00:10:22,415
You just fucking get into the cab,
and on your work.

88
00:10:22,783 --> 00:10:25,800
Yeah, she's on the way.
She cann't wait to see you.

89
00:10:26,051 --> 00:10:29,014
Rambo this skate boy pimp is
my tenth kill.

90
00:10:32,266 --> 00:10:34,630
Taking me as a street sweeper.

91
00:10:34,736 --> 00:10:38,503
I cleaned up this worthless piece of shit
and left him an obituary sols.

92
00:10:38,817 --> 00:10:41,007
It rhymes.

93
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,938
Rooster, we're gonna find out who did this.

94
00:10:51,313 --> 00:10:52,818
Give him a medal.

95
00:10:52,909 --> 00:10:55,378
Hey, Rambo, see who will do this?

96
00:10:56,003 --> 00:10:57,345
He ain't talk, aint he?

97
00:10:58,433 --> 00:11:00,515
- Real name, Robert Bridie

98
00:11:00,516 --> 00:11:02,601
Robert Bridie, Damn shame.

99
00:11:02,613 --> 00:11:05,397
What're you thinking?
Mash?Gray?

100
00:11:05,475 --> 00:11:07,188
You guys wanna mess my crime scene again?

101
00:11:07,296 --> 00:11:09,902
You don't who Bobby Bridie is ?

102
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,464
I have met him an hour ago.

103
00:11:11,998 --> 00:11:13,463
It looks like close french.

104
00:11:13,552 --> 00:11:16,064
Yeah, from the stippling on the wound,
that's two three feet away.

105
00:11:16,353 --> 00:11:17,896
There will be fish and flagon
out of his brains.

106
00:11:19,439 --> 00:11:21,435
- What?
- Well, I just got that.

107
00:11:21,678 --> 00:11:22,714
Mash Gray

108
00:11:23,152 --> 00:11:23,821
Good one, Rooster.

109
00:11:24,207 --> 00:11:25,046
That's quick.

110
00:11:25,239 --> 00:11:27,177
I just tried to keep pace with you.

111
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:34,633
HE TRADES IN SIN DISTRIBUTE FLESH

112
00:11:34,723 --> 00:11:36,931
HE PICKS THE FRUIT WHEN IT IS FRESH

113
00:11:37,086 --> 00:11:40,518
NOW SOMEONE ELSE MUST SLAP HIS WHORE

114
00:11:40,553 --> 00:11:43,209
HIS HEART HAS STOPPED,
HE BREATH NO MORE.

115
00:11:46,995 --> 00:11:48,175
What do you wanna do about this?

116
00:11:49,697 --> 00:11:51,526
I say let's make the best activity.

117
00:11:51,576 --> 00:11:54,991
Canvas the whores,
'cause maybe you will meet one you like.

118
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:58,535
Na, Please.
I got one to handle from you know who.

119
00:11:58,827 --> 00:12:00,131
Don't shade.

120
00:12:00,132 --> 00:12:03,260
She's gotten my phallus level slow,
so I gotta sit down to take a piece.

121
00:12:03,574 --> 00:12:06,013
- Oh, thank you for that picture.
- He, what can I tell you.

122
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,018
How can I help you, Gentleman?

123
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,305
We would like to talk about your boss.

124
00:12:13,068 --> 00:12:14,096
He's upstairs.

125
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:15,967
Your other boss.

126
00:12:20,452 --> 00:12:22,225
Rambo...

127
00:12:23,111 --> 00:12:24,709
He's asshole.

128
00:12:24,838 --> 00:12:26,462
Why he's asshole?

129
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:28,986
Follow me, please.

130
00:12:35,196 --> 00:12:36,528
You know anybody..., wanna kill him?

131
00:12:36,633 --> 00:12:37,571
Me.

132
00:12:38,664 --> 00:12:39,430
Anyone else?

133
00:12:39,723 --> 00:12:40,154
Why?

134
00:12:40,688 --> 00:12:42,506
He's dead?

135
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:47,524
Hey, Listen, you wanna smart and help us out,
or I'm gonna call somebody in ICE...

136
00:12:47,572 --> 00:12:49,923
and have you explain to pass the land.

137
00:12:50,307 --> 00:12:53,286
Go ahead, I'm an American citizen.

138
00:12:55,319 --> 00:12:57,363
You can lick my ball anytime.

139
00:12:57,937 --> 00:12:58,802
What?

140
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:03,628
Call us anytime, you know...
if you hear something, anything.

141
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:08,888
I think we are looking for a guy
named Sam the Butcher out.

142
00:13:09,098 --> 00:13:10,140
Who?

143
00:13:11,198 --> 00:13:12,349
Nice kidding around.

144
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:15,269
But seriously, Lieutenant, how far you want us
to go with this Rambo murder?

145
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:19,274
I don't know, I think maybe you investigate
a little more, figure out who did it...

146
00:13:19,484 --> 00:13:20,527
...try to put him into jail.

147
00:13:20,797 --> 00:13:23,143
As it doesn't get in the way of
your shuffle board lessons.

148
00:13:23,628 --> 00:13:24,275
Yeah, No problem.

149
00:13:25,044 --> 00:13:29,049
We are also working on this dealer "Spider" as
tight as two steps to find out the fresh kills.

150
00:13:32,488 --> 00:13:35,206
We can near him, who knows how far
of the lie riddle lead.

151
00:13:35,602 --> 00:13:36,250
So what about it?

152
00:13:36,897 --> 00:13:39,530
I poped a slit would annouce a blow,
she just showed up by nose.

153
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,095
I got the flip on him.

154
00:13:41,186 --> 00:13:42,227
Lucky fuck, ah?

155
00:13:42,966 --> 00:13:44,937
- So she got it from him directly?
- Yeah, she did.

156
00:13:45,797 --> 00:13:46,485
Good.

157
00:13:47,051 --> 00:13:49,640
OK, We get a way he cann't hang on,
then kick a loose.

158
00:13:50,409 --> 00:13:52,270
I hate trying to prosecute fucking laze.

159
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:02,505
This isn't Spider Club.

160
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,109
Backyard.

161
00:14:04,423 --> 00:14:07,342
Yeah, it's an abandoned linen Factory,
Jessica

162
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,322
I guess I'm at your role of...
What you call it?

163
00:14:11,687 --> 00:14:13,710
- Rat.
- Stoolie.

164
00:14:15,004 --> 00:14:15,611
Thanks.

165
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:21,521
I mean I think usually some poor
African-American caters, junk here, or prostitute.

166
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:24,921
There was a long way 200
and many years the club boys...

167
00:14:24,922 --> 00:14:27,946
...were smarter than
the African and American junky whore.

168
00:14:28,135 --> 00:14:30,498
Normally, but sometimes they only think they are.

169
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,001
It's all settled, Sir.

170
00:14:33,168 --> 00:14:35,191
You guys are sure safe in there?

171
00:14:35,514 --> 00:14:37,942
Tell your girlfriend to grow up here.
And let's go.

172
00:14:39,762 --> 00:14:41,219
What do you say, Counsellor? Ready to do this thing?

173
00:14:41,826 --> 00:14:43,929
Yeah, let's get over with it.

174
00:14:44,495 --> 00:14:49,309
OK, when all we set, you go in there,
you wait him for asking you for what you need.

175
00:14:50,564 --> 00:14:53,112
And you don't come back here with
less than four ounces.

176
00:14:53,355 --> 00:14:54,487
- Four aounces?
- Yeah.

177
00:14:54,771 --> 00:14:57,562
Isn't that a lot?
I just buy a little bit and that's it.

178
00:14:57,562 --> 00:15:00,192
Just say you're gonna ski for
weeks with fresh powder.

179
00:15:00,475 --> 00:15:01,850
Yeah, you tell him you are going on vacation.

180
00:15:05,813 --> 00:15:09,252
I do this thing and
my records wiped clean.

181
00:15:09,536 --> 00:15:10,386
As a whistle.

182
00:15:10,386 --> 00:15:12,368
No one in that loft room
and then I got busted, right?

183
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:13,823
That never happened.

184
00:15:15,806 --> 00:15:17,707
Counsellor, we all know you better than this.

185
00:15:17,707 --> 00:15:20,596
You just do this, you stop showing off
and shut up your nose, you go home...

186
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,455
You got married, you got kids, you never come back again, and that's that.

187
00:15:26,566 --> 00:15:27,214
Yeah.

188
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,121
Okay, we're going.

189
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:34,092
Yes, sir!

190
00:15:40,038 --> 00:15:40,888
Hey, Jessica.

191
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:42,991
Beak a leg.

192
00:15:46,915 --> 00:15:50,233
Two flats down, door is on the left,
ring the bell.

193
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:00,143
Hey, Stubby, why don't you just go down
get our company up here?

194
00:16:02,286 --> 00:16:03,136
Come on, fat boy.

195
00:16:07,857 --> 00:16:08,921
Get it on.

196
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:18,145
Good afternoon, Ya.

197
00:16:18,873 --> 00:16:19,520
Hey, Spider.

198
00:16:19,966 --> 00:16:21,220
- I'll be on the stairs.
- All right.

199
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,889
- How are you?
- I'm fine, baby.

200
00:16:24,698 --> 00:16:27,369
Checking out this video sheet before
my kids watching it. Have you seen this?

201
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:29,189
No.

202
00:16:29,553 --> 00:16:33,060
'Cause you just don't deal with them,
let them alone they stir to that junkie.

203
00:16:33,061 --> 00:16:33,895
You know what I'm saying?

204
00:16:33,963 --> 00:16:34,934
You know, he's gotten the point.

205
00:16:35,743 --> 00:16:37,740
- Remember Underdog?
- What dog?

206
00:16:38,008 --> 00:16:40,840
That fucking dog, spawn a generation
of junkies.

207
00:16:41,123 --> 00:16:44,683
So you converted the bank into a
club and recording studio?

208
00:16:44,926 --> 00:16:47,353
- Yeah, do you like it?
- Yeah.

209
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:48,486
What are you talking about?

210
00:16:49,497 --> 00:16:50,752
What did the underdog do all the time?

211
00:16:51,479 --> 00:16:52,370
It was shining shoes,

212
00:16:52,371 --> 00:16:57,167
and when Sweet Polly Purebred called out to him,
his dog's ears will pick it up and he will rescue her.

213
00:16:57,304 --> 00:17:01,471
And what's he doing when he needs super strength?
He goes to his ring, remember?

214
00:17:02,158 --> 00:17:03,251
Pull out a pill, pop it.

215
00:17:03,493 --> 00:17:04,909
Holly shit, you are right.

216
00:17:05,035 --> 00:17:06,672
He was a little fucking speak for you.

217
00:17:07,094 --> 00:17:08,186
So what's the business?

218
00:17:08,804 --> 00:17:09,966
How about QP?

219
00:17:10,081 --> 00:17:11,625
I think it good for QP.

220
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:12,757
Fuck how long with QP?

221
00:17:13,161 --> 00:17:15,589
I'm gonna ski, with friends.

222
00:17:16,641 --> 00:17:17,491
A lot of friends.

223
00:17:18,219 --> 00:17:18,866
Where?

224
00:17:19,096 --> 00:17:20,444
Aspen, Colorado.

225
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:23,315
Shit,
I'll show you some you're going ask us.

226
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:25,177
Now you prima grand.

227
00:17:27,078 --> 00:17:29,497
- Whisky?
- Sure, my whole life.

228
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,528
Come on, I mean I don't have all day.

229
00:17:32,989 --> 00:17:35,109
I want you to put off that jacket,
be still a little while.

230
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:36,724
What do you think?

231
00:17:36,828 --> 00:17:41,277
Actually, I gotta run. I have major IPO closing
in one hour, so...

232
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,636
That is just to scare you,
let you know.

233
00:17:46,409 --> 00:17:47,750
Absolutely I get...

234
00:17:48,216 --> 00:17:49,530
What do you want to do?

235
00:17:53,765 --> 00:17:55,627
You know where you hide the wire?

236
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:01,422
well you've been such a bitch, you pop chose
a wrong nigger like me.

237
00:18:02,277 --> 00:18:03,567
You're scared, now.

238
00:18:07,288 --> 00:18:09,230
Looks like your cowboy coming to rescue you.

239
00:18:11,831 --> 00:18:13,033
Can I help you, Gentlemen?

240
00:18:13,276 --> 00:18:14,692
Yeah, let us in, Spider.

241
00:18:14,935 --> 00:18:16,431
I'm sorry, but there's no one here
by that name.

242
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:18,979
- Let us in
- We only wanna talk to you.

243
00:18:22,823 --> 00:18:23,916
See, I know how to look,

244
00:18:24,112 --> 00:18:25,250
and I know where to look.

245
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,168
Come to Papa.

246
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:36,456
It always hurts for the firt time.

247
00:18:38,074 --> 00:18:38,641
Are you all right?

248
00:18:38,924 --> 00:18:40,704
Why would she be aid,
she's watching TV.

249
00:18:40,987 --> 00:18:42,767
As fuck as she got hurt for watching TV.

250
00:18:42,767 --> 00:18:45,824
- She could have seen, I heard,  something scared her.
- Like what?

251
00:18:46,044 --> 00:18:49,038
Like some big fuck machoist
big fat fucking mouth dog.

252
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,642
Well, nobody here fits that description
till a minute ago.

253
00:18:51,746 --> 00:18:53,526
I'm gonna show you, ugly fuck...

254
00:18:53,526 --> 00:18:56,203
- We said enough.
- If then, bring your wife up here.

255
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:59,150
That's enough, let's go, let's go.
It's okay.

256
00:18:59,785 --> 00:19:01,213
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

257
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:03,925
- I'm okay.
- You want your wire back?

258
00:19:06,108 --> 00:19:06,958
Fire!

259
00:19:07,376 --> 00:19:09,044
No, Stubby, No!

260
00:19:17,736 --> 00:19:19,094
Get down! Get the fuck down!

261
00:19:29,484 --> 00:19:30,421
Come on!

262
00:19:30,651 --> 00:19:31,959
Fat one is dead.

263
00:19:43,204 --> 00:19:44,256
That went well?

264
00:19:46,035 --> 00:19:47,249
Oh, shit, you're bleeding.

265
00:19:48,544 --> 00:19:51,740
3-4 squad to central
1141 request ambulance.

266
00:19:51,814 --> 00:19:54,652
I need the EMS(Emergency Medical Services),
subject shot at 184 St. Niklaas.

267
00:19:55,866 --> 00:19:58,989
- I've tried the best that I can...
- You're gonna be just fine, Concy, just fine.

268
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:00,721
Just relax.

269
00:20:01,085 --> 00:20:03,431
Hey, guys, if you ever need a lawyer...

270
00:20:11,371 --> 00:20:12,695
In good old days,

271
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:16,504
we left the criminal sleep down
before call for the ambulance.

272
00:20:16,513 --> 00:20:18,323
- Calm, calm, ...
- Fucking lowlife.

273
00:20:18,324 --> 00:20:19,679
Made your point, you made your point.

274
00:20:19,743 --> 00:20:22,350
Tough a little bit, ain't you?
Kick me when I'm handcuffed.

275
00:20:22,412 --> 00:20:25,061
Shut your fuck up, you piece of shit!

276
00:20:25,195 --> 00:20:26,691
You think I won't blow your fucking head off?

277
00:20:26,777 --> 00:20:28,593
I wouldn't think twice about it.

278
00:20:28,806 --> 00:20:31,767
I go in there, get the fat boy's gun.
Come back to you.

279
00:20:33,118 --> 00:20:34,297
Between your eyes.

280
00:20:38,959 --> 00:20:40,545
Where's EMS?

281
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:44,249
This thing was a cluster fucked
and all cluster fucks.

282
00:20:44,693 --> 00:20:45,422
You got nothing.

283
00:20:46,635 --> 00:20:47,768
What about finding the murder?

284
00:20:48,172 --> 00:20:52,380
No drugs, right? So...,
No preaddict felon and No conspiracy, No nothing.

285
00:20:52,986 --> 00:20:56,182
No felon, no felon, I can't believe
just no felon, how do you spell felon.

286
00:20:56,506 --> 00:20:59,985
Harlem site, racketeer, drugs.
I mean what are we talking about?

287
00:20:59,985 --> 00:21:01,967
Hey, you are lucky
that white girl didn't die!

288
00:21:02,534 --> 00:21:06,984
IAB is gonna interview both of you and do a preliminary report over the next couple of weeks.

289
00:21:07,226 --> 00:21:10,462
Now, off the record...
You actually didn't violate the procedure.

290
00:21:10,705 --> 00:21:13,051
Because the victim had a firearm
and did you.

291
00:21:13,051 --> 00:21:14,993
So if you stick together,
you should make through this.

292
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,813
You better get your story straight, dude.

293
00:21:17,097 --> 00:21:19,939
Because I'm not going back to Far Rockway,
because you two fucked up.

294
00:21:20,044 --> 00:21:22,761
And you gonna spend some couch time
with Rubber Gun Squad.

295
00:21:22,761 --> 00:21:26,685
You better take this shrink seriously.
Or you will be all out of duty.

296
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:28,073
That fucking piece of shit just walks.

297
00:21:28,282 --> 00:21:29,533
Knock it off, Turk!

298
00:21:32,652 --> 00:21:35,375
Relax, partner, he's gonna get gears.

299
00:21:35,618 --> 00:21:35,889
Gentlemen,

300
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,455
your questions.

301
00:21:37,628 --> 00:21:39,676
Who made the decision to enter at that time.

302
00:21:39,884 --> 00:21:40,346
I did.

303
00:21:40,398 --> 00:21:42,482
- Whoes decision was at the end of this crisis?
- Mine.

304
00:21:42,492 --> 00:21:45,322
- Did you immediately identify yourselves as police offiers?
- Yes, we did.

305
00:21:45,357 --> 00:21:47,285
Did you immediately identify
yourselves as police offiers?

306
00:21:47,286 --> 00:21:50,980
Informer's position was becoming untellable,
and we were afraid that she was in danger.

307
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:53,337
- Sounds like are right.
- You fucking kidding note farrow.

308
00:21:53,358 --> 00:21:55,469
- Excuse me, Detective?
- Are you finishing with my client?

309
00:21:58,987 --> 00:22:00,513
They are like Lennon and McCartney.

310
00:22:00,618 --> 00:22:02,293
Not an inch lies between them.

311
00:22:02,668 --> 00:22:03,652
What do you think?

312
00:22:03,756 --> 00:22:04,558
Nothing there.

313
00:22:05,419 --> 00:22:09,645
Endanger the informer, we can make them round that.
They saw gun, they reacted.

314
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,782
He beat the fuckhead suspect,
but he's not falling in charges.

315
00:22:13,389 --> 00:22:15,302
Let's see what the shrink says.

316
00:22:17,596 --> 00:22:20,630
So, ah..., What are we gonna do now?
Doc., we gonna find out define...

317
00:22:20,716 --> 00:22:24,816
Saying enough to carry a gun?
Chase bad guys?

318
00:22:24,953 --> 00:22:26,293
OK, Why did you become a cop?

319
00:22:26,657 --> 00:22:29,125
Well, it was New Year's Eve,
Seems a good idea at the time.

320
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:33,566
I don't have to say
my opportunity as you had, Dr. Prosky.

321
00:22:33,575 --> 00:22:36,042
Where I come from was either gun and badge...

322
00:22:36,406 --> 00:22:38,020
or hardhat and hammer.

323
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:40,568
How did you feel when you fired your weapon?

324
00:22:41,342 --> 00:22:42,703
It's like Dirty Harry said:

325
00:22:43,017 --> 00:22:45,937
It's nothing wrong with a little shooting,
as long as the right people get shot.

326
00:22:46,438 --> 00:22:48,582
When the wrong people got shot?
Sucks fuck.

327
00:22:49,432 --> 00:22:52,918
I'd rather be end in annihilable,
that's not the worst mean as you got a badge.

328
00:22:53,154 --> 00:22:55,055
How do you feel when you see innocent
people get killed?

329
00:22:56,754 --> 00:22:57,442
You know....

330
00:22:59,303 --> 00:23:00,597
sort of getting numb to it.

331
00:23:02,997 --> 00:23:03,727
Here.

332
00:23:05,655 --> 00:23:06,544
I want you to take this.

333
00:23:07,312 --> 00:23:12,531
Use this to jot down your thoughts, your questions, anything you may notice about yourself.

334
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:13,624
Wahtever.

335
00:23:14,433 --> 00:23:15,202
I won't ask for it.

336
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:17,548
Just for you.

337
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:20,298
You should try it.

338
00:23:21,471 --> 00:23:22,241
Sounds like a fun.

339
00:23:42,993 --> 00:23:43,923
Go, Turk, go!

340
00:23:45,784 --> 00:23:46,512
You got dirt!

341
00:23:47,078 --> 00:23:47,847
Go!Go!

342
00:23:48,615 --> 00:23:49,101
Yeah!

343
00:23:49,832 --> 00:23:51,188
Right there!

344
00:23:51,326 --> 00:23:51,933
You won it!

345
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:53,025
You won it!

346
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:55,303
Don't matter what they say about you!

347
00:23:55,777 --> 00:23:56,423
You're tremendous!

348
00:23:59,983 --> 00:24:01,035
Go, Turk!

349
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:01,803
Go!

350
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,637
Safe! You droped the ball!

351
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:08,358
- What a fucking cheap shot!
- That from the bat.

352
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,357
- Or what? Or what?...
- Go after the bat.

353
00:24:10,566 --> 00:24:11,713
Don't "or what"!

354
00:24:14,113 --> 00:24:15,781
I had the ball!!

355
00:24:19,953 --> 00:24:21,517
I had the ball!

356
00:24:22,515 --> 00:24:26,925
The NYPD is probably more frustrations, hostility and testosterone...

357
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,786
and ready to a rob at any moment.

358
00:24:29,716 --> 00:24:34,004
Take me as a released foul, one flicks the trigger
and the pressure goes down.

359
00:24:34,895 --> 00:24:36,108
You know why you enjoy the force?

360
00:24:36,796 --> 00:24:37,686
To get respect!

361
00:24:38,455 --> 00:24:39,910
Most people respect the badge.

362
00:24:40,315 --> 00:24:42,055
Everybody respects the gun!

363
00:24:47,597 --> 00:24:52,158
Hey, Riley, I was talking to JD, you guys caught
a stiff named Phillip Trager?

364
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:53,202
A gun runner?

365
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:56,379
- Oh, yeah, real piece of shit.
- How did that go down?

366
00:24:56,506 --> 00:24:59,208
I don't know. Somebody gave him a
taste of his own medicine I guess.

367
00:24:59,774 --> 00:25:02,120
A man intruded his apartement,
killed him with one of his own guns.

368
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:04,398
The shooter, you know anything about him?

369
00:25:05,154 --> 00:25:07,460
Yeah, actually the shootter left a poem.

370
00:25:11,101 --> 00:25:11,667
He did?

371
00:25:12,274 --> 00:25:12,840
Oh, shit it!

372
00:25:13,528 --> 00:25:16,563
Simon, you ah...remember that poem?

373
00:25:17,411 --> 00:25:18,220
The Trager case.

374
00:25:21,821 --> 00:25:24,005
- What are you doing, man?
- No, Turk asked about it.

375
00:25:24,632 --> 00:25:26,092
What hell are you doing?

376
00:25:31,306 --> 00:25:33,392
Hey..., he wants to hear about the poem.

377
00:25:35,788 --> 00:25:37,719
YOU MUCH IN THE DEALING CLASS,

378
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:40,753
I SLIT HIS DOOR TO CAP THIS ASS.

379
00:25:40,995 --> 00:25:42,129
HE TOOK HIS GUN AND TOOK HIS...

380
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:44,798
I TOOK HIS LIFE AND TOOK HIS GUN.
BUT TOO BETTER IS NOT THE ONLY ONE.

381
00:25:46,093 --> 00:25:49,289
That's all I got, something like that.
It's not ain't a bit of pantoum, but it rhymes.

382
00:25:50,219 --> 00:25:51,594
- Rooster!
- Yo!

383
00:25:53,617 --> 00:25:55,609
We're looking for the same guy.
He knocked off a pimp named Rambo.

384
00:25:55,713 --> 00:25:57,768
A few weeks ago at Bruce Prizer.
When was yours?

385
00:25:57,779 --> 00:26:00,779
Last week, we were on the roll with ATF
because of the guns.

386
00:26:01,061 --> 00:26:02,540
We are back in business
on the Rambo case.

387
00:26:02,645 --> 00:26:05,148
Looks like the same guy knocked off
a gun dealer on the three three last week.

388
00:26:05,149 --> 00:26:06,191
Oh, shit!

389
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:08,140
- What do you mean you are back in business?
- That's our case.

390
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:09,195
You're taking our case...

391
00:26:09,259 --> 00:26:11,539
Take it along, you're learning something.

392
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,847
Tell me the guy's name is Great Grady.

393
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:18,012
Please, it is, isn't it?
Oh, somebody is gonna knock off the Brady Bunch.

394
00:26:19,064 --> 00:26:20,358
Gonna be a pouch of scrambling.

395
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:26,344
Trager, gun runner, bites the dust
Number eleven.

396
00:26:35,786 --> 00:26:39,706
The bullet, matched the 45 in Trager's aparment.

397
00:26:39,707 --> 00:26:42,053
That was no surprise. So I went through ATF.

398
00:26:42,137 --> 00:26:46,214
It's one of the batch of six.
It's stolen from a gun shop by junior last month.

399
00:26:46,305 --> 00:26:47,631
Yeah, probably by Trager.

400
00:26:47,651 --> 00:26:49,790
That's what they think,
he matches the description they have.

401
00:26:49,895 --> 00:26:51,355
This still doesn't help about finding this guy,

402
00:26:51,461 --> 00:26:54,693
just helps the times to victims,
which he's already doing a little fucking poems.

403
00:26:57,387 --> 00:26:57,873
Hello.

404
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,209
Hey, Turk, don't forget
we got court date later.

405
00:27:02,324 --> 00:27:03,330
So, ah...

406
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:08,330
I heard he..., ah..., shot the dealer
you guys took down.

407
00:27:08,331 --> 00:27:09,373
Spider.

408
00:27:10,818 --> 00:27:11,466
So?

409
00:27:12,882 --> 00:27:13,771
Did he?

410
00:27:18,383 --> 00:27:20,841
Yeah, got him down on to the ground...

411
00:27:21,538 --> 00:27:22,954
the guy was handcuffed.

412
00:27:24,612 --> 00:27:26,832
He used to kick him when he got him.

413
00:27:29,232 --> 00:27:29,649
And then...

414
00:27:30,478 --> 00:27:32,611
He gets down to the guy's chest.

415
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:35,727
And he really started. Smacked him.

416
00:27:35,939 --> 00:27:38,966
High in the face..., over and over.

417
00:27:38,971 --> 00:27:44,622
Screaming at the stomach and the lung.
"I'm gonna break you fucking face you little bitch."

418
00:27:45,648 --> 00:27:48,925
Then his eyes really started to get filled up...
you know when he got...

419
00:27:48,926 --> 00:27:51,012
"balck", you know how we get so...

420
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:52,485
rage on him.

421
00:27:53,769 --> 00:27:55,873
I thought he was gonna kill this guy.

422
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:57,906
Really?

423
00:28:02,692 --> 00:28:04,917
You're a bad little girl.

424
00:28:06,755 --> 00:28:07,934
I gotta work to do.

425
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:08,789
You bad.

426
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:13,477
Counsellor.

427
00:28:13,841 --> 00:28:17,521
My hands are tight here,
without secure Chain of Custody.

428
00:28:17,845 --> 00:28:21,890
Any evidence obtained after the initial
search must be excluded.

429
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:23,103
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

430
00:28:23,103 --> 00:28:27,715
Therefore, I'm forced to grant defence motion
to dismiss all charges...

431
00:28:27,715 --> 00:28:29,819
of rape assault against Mr. Benlect

432
00:28:30,062 --> 00:28:30,790
Your honor.

433
00:28:31,113 --> 00:28:33,541
You think I want this guy going
anywhere near my daughter?

434
00:28:33,541 --> 00:28:35,968
Or anyone's daughter for that matter?

435
00:28:36,291 --> 00:28:42,724
I'm unleashing your client on to the world.
I'm sure we all will be back here again very soon.

436
00:28:43,142 --> 00:28:43,768
Look out.

437
00:28:43,769 --> 00:28:45,229
Look at this motherfucker...

438
00:28:46,567 --> 00:28:49,776
Hey, a short caveat for you,
come on, you're gonna get it.

439
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:51,826
When you walk outside,
watch your back.

440
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:53,080
Order in my court!

441
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:57,227
- You mother fuck...
- Not here, not now. Not here, not now.

442
00:28:57,619 --> 00:29:01,009
Would you get him out of here, before somebody
pissed nonsense on your son, and you can't be you.

443
00:29:01,778 --> 00:29:04,732
- Oder! Oder!
- You know what I mean. Go, go.

444
00:29:04,852 --> 00:29:06,170
Detective!

445
00:29:06,714 --> 00:29:09,667
Dr. Prosky suggested that I free associated.

446
00:29:10,355 --> 00:29:11,285
So, here I go.

447
00:29:13,064 --> 00:29:15,005
You know what I think about
when I pull a trigger?

448
00:29:15,774 --> 00:29:19,092
I think about the infield fly rule,
I love that fucking rule.

449
00:29:19,143 --> 00:29:21,033
It assumes the worst of everybody.

450
00:29:21,235 --> 00:29:24,634
It's "Sorry, batter, you're a shmuck for pop up",
but the runner is on.

451
00:29:24,634 --> 00:29:29,084
And you stupid ass infielder yelled "get the cheat",
drop the ball, just because you called the break.

452
00:29:29,327 --> 00:29:33,614
My favour part's the batter is out,
but the runner advanced at his own risk.

453
00:29:33,614 --> 00:29:35,921
Well, isn't this a unpleasant surprise?

454
00:29:36,203 --> 00:29:39,885
That's the way I should be,
you could be a motherfucker at your own risk...

455
00:29:43,768 --> 00:29:44,375
...or not.

456
00:29:44,504 --> 00:29:48,501
Van Luytens, one less rapist.
Who's gonna miss him.

457
00:29:49,028 --> 00:29:49,594
Nobody.

458
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,212
Number Twelve, and counting.

459
00:30:06,434 --> 00:30:07,556
Oh,.., hot coffee.

460
00:30:08,283 --> 00:30:09,698
- Morning, Detective
- Morning.

461
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:10,548
They are on the left.

462
00:30:10,791 --> 00:30:13,542
- force entry?
- It doesn't look like, Dectective Perez is in there.

463
00:30:13,542 --> 00:30:14,715
He's already there? All right

464
00:30:14,715 --> 00:30:16,374
- Hi, how about those matches last night?
- Yeah, no doubt.

465
00:30:17,547 --> 00:30:18,679
Hey, Teddy, Teddy, come here.
Check this out.

466
00:30:23,777 --> 00:30:24,303
Fuck.

467
00:30:26,204 --> 00:30:26,771
That's big.

468
00:30:27,498 --> 00:30:28,146
Powerful.

469
00:30:29,076 --> 00:30:31,706
- Plasma, must be?
- No, CT.

470
00:30:31,707 --> 00:30:34,418
- That's plasma.
- Na, it gotta be CT, look.

471
00:30:34,497 --> 00:30:35,231
-Hey guys.
- That won't be that big.

472
00:30:35,388 --> 00:30:36,803
Guys.

473
00:30:37,774 --> 00:30:39,352
He was shot at close range,
dropped right here.

474
00:30:40,161 --> 00:30:42,305
The pussy doesn't like him to put
much of fight, doesn't it, Karen?

475
00:30:42,669 --> 00:30:44,166
Nothing to indicate that.

476
00:30:44,651 --> 00:30:48,049
Too so fast for struggle,
no force entry, cuts, bruises.

477
00:30:48,454 --> 00:30:51,043
Hey, nobody wants to hear about
your private life, officer Corelli.

478
00:30:51,771 --> 00:30:54,846
That's a Decetive of you,
Officer NeedleDick.

479
00:30:57,071 --> 00:30:58,082
Looks like it's our guy again.

480
00:30:58,325 --> 00:30:59,094
Who did he get this time?

481
00:30:59,094 --> 00:31:03,220
It's Jon Van Luytens,
owns coupla car dealer ships.

482
00:31:03,463 --> 00:31:06,576
- Oh, shit.
- He's on a rape charge, but he got tossed off last week.

483
00:31:08,114 --> 00:31:08,720
Read this.

484
00:31:09,557 --> 00:31:11,707
THE MAN AVOID THE WAR,
RESPECT FOR BEAUTY.

485
00:31:11,846 --> 00:31:14,791
CHARMER INTO OLD INTO LATE
HE TOOK women...

486
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,863
...WOMEN WILL NOT GUILTY,
DID NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO LIVE.

487
00:31:19,239 --> 00:31:20,210
It's our boy, right?

488
00:31:20,694 --> 00:31:23,486
It's got a beat for old pal Johnny.

489
00:31:24,053 --> 00:31:24,740
You know him?

490
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:26,531
Yeah.

491
00:31:26,681 --> 00:31:28,751
He was sloppy son of bitch,
let me tell you.

492
00:31:31,646 --> 00:31:34,824
You guys know how much fun it is
that not catch the serial killer.

493
00:31:34,824 --> 00:31:36,189
You got a point, Lieutenant?

494
00:31:37,241 --> 00:31:38,050
The point is...

495
00:31:38,858 --> 00:31:42,742
You better both think seriously about
wheither or not you want to lead on this case.

496
00:31:42,945 --> 00:31:44,522
You don't think we are up to this?

497
00:31:46,134 --> 00:31:46,950
Come on.

498
00:31:48,527 --> 00:31:51,480
You got what? One hundred and ten years
on the job between you two of here?

499
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,412
A hundred and twenty.

500
00:31:54,675 --> 00:31:58,560
I'm telling you, you screw up dadly enough,
you may try to fuck out your pension.

501
00:31:58,986 --> 00:32:00,421
You want to risk that?

502
00:32:00,617 --> 00:32:01,998
- Yeah.
- Fuck yeah.

503
00:32:03,118 --> 00:32:04,708
406, Lieutenant

504
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:07,136
406.

505
00:32:07,932 --> 00:32:09,886
OK, 406, what does that mean?

506
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:10,898
Ted Williams.

507
00:32:11,707 --> 00:32:14,509
Ted Williams' last hit at season back to 400...

508
00:32:14,618 --> 00:32:17,624
Sox's manager wants him to pension
to protect his average, right?

509
00:32:17,729 --> 00:32:23,115
The man's playing both games anyway,
go six more ends up as 406 last guy ever hit over 400.

510
00:32:23,362 --> 00:32:25,784
OK, fine, it's all yours.

511
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:27,929
Just don't go moan and wail when some...

512
00:32:28,142 --> 00:32:32,859
...traffic cop pulls your series killer
over for speed, and he grab your 15 minutes of fame.

513
00:32:32,964 --> 00:32:37,233
And you realized..., the ass hole could stand
right there in front of you.

514
00:32:37,476 --> 00:32:40,429
And it will take you
a thousand light years to nail him.

515
00:32:40,429 --> 00:32:44,960
Not offensive, Lieutenant.
Light years measures distant, not time.

516
00:32:47,143 --> 00:32:49,733
Well thank you, Detective
I will make a note of that.

517
00:32:49,739 --> 00:32:52,301
Ellis Lynde ,2003

518
00:32:53,205 --> 00:32:58,001
This guy had a hisory of strolling gay bars.
Pick out a 20, beat shit out of them.

519
00:32:58,169 --> 00:33:00,372
Then he was found shot dead
in his apartment.

520
00:33:01,075 --> 00:33:04,377
The one was just doing this to get
real close to the guy.

521
00:33:05,105 --> 00:33:07,087
Blow his brains out,
without any trouble.

522
00:33:07,109 --> 00:33:08,746
Leaves no finger prints. And obviously...

523
00:33:09,232 --> 00:33:10,635
take his private room.

524
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:14,806
Okay, it could be murder number two,
back from 04(2004).

525
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:24,685
I was shaking at the first coupla times
that I killed in cold blood.

526
00:33:26,383 --> 00:33:28,975
Keep thinking if I got caught, they keep
you away of the force...

527
00:33:29,122 --> 00:33:32,563
I wasn't worrying about the prison,
but losing the gun and the shell, that's can't be.

528
00:33:33,098 --> 00:33:35,764
I went to work the next day
expect them feel different.

529
00:33:35,778 --> 00:33:41,708
I thought everybody will look at me the way
cops look at civilians knowing which one is dirty.

530
00:33:48,069 --> 00:33:48,903
And they didn't.

531
00:33:49,161 --> 00:33:51,770
That's when I knew
I can keep on doing this.

532
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:53,530
...foever.

533
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:00,123
So..., next stop, Spider.

534
00:34:00,219 --> 00:34:04,370
If we shut down his business,
maybe he'll be a rap.

535
00:34:04,982 --> 00:34:06,231
We got a lawyer.

536
00:34:06,797 --> 00:34:09,761
We need her to testify that
she bought coke from him.

537
00:34:11,275 --> 00:34:12,825
She was a good lawyer.

538
00:34:13,094 --> 00:34:16,951
Me and my partner paid a visit to
Club 404 Harlem

539
00:34:17,232 --> 00:34:18,180
I worried about him.

540
00:34:18,555 --> 00:34:21,632
Tom Cowan has been my partner for almost 30 years.

541
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:23,747
He's the best cop I've ever seen.

542
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:28,238
I'm always the one follows him into the door.

543
00:34:29,258 --> 00:34:33,659
There was a bullet that was meant for me
that slugged his torso.

544
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,397
He was my role model.

545
00:34:37,015 --> 00:34:41,592
The day I stopped trying to be Tom Cowan.
Was the greatest day of my life.

546
00:34:50,873 --> 00:34:52,750
EVIDENCE
Randall.

547
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:57,081
Hey.

548
00:34:57,254 --> 00:34:58,184
Rooster.

549
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:01,458
I was looking through the files on poetry boy.

550
00:35:01,893 --> 00:35:03,969
That's an interesting way to pass your time.

551
00:35:05,749 --> 00:35:08,221
There was a gun found on
Charles Randall when he was arrested.

552
00:35:09,369 --> 00:35:09,890
Yeah?

553
00:35:09,968 --> 00:35:12,753
I know in other shootings,
a gun was found at the scene

554
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:14,926
But there is a lot of similarities.

555
00:35:14,977 --> 00:35:18,866
So I mentioned it to Perez and Riley.
I think someone should go to interview the prisoner.

556
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:20,670
I think there may be a connection.

557
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:24,483
That's an good idea.
But not to Perez and Riley.

558
00:35:24,712 --> 00:35:27,109
I mean you know those guys
can make it just screwed it up.

559
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:28,228
This is too important.

560
00:35:29,372 --> 00:35:33,096
Turk and I will handle that Randall, okay?.
Good work.

561
00:36:05,857 --> 00:36:07,418
Detectives, Charles Randall.

562
00:36:09,727 --> 00:36:11,642
What fuck you two son of bitch want?

563
00:36:12,166 --> 00:36:13,873
What a greeting.

564
00:36:15,404 --> 00:36:17,282
Do you like poetry, Charles?

565
00:36:17,991 --> 00:36:18,749
What?

566
00:36:19,766 --> 00:36:21,564
Do you like poetry?

567
00:36:23,111 --> 00:36:23,951
Yeah.

568
00:36:24,817 --> 00:36:26,745
Roses are red, violets are blue.

569
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:30,500
I wanna poke out your fucking eyes
with my dick, you fuck.

570
00:36:31,058 --> 00:36:34,553
- How's that?
- I thought it would rhyme, but it didn't.

571
00:36:35,221 --> 00:36:37,792
Fuck you, fuck both of you.
Get me out of here.

572
00:36:48,735 --> 00:36:50,730
Why the fuck we wanna going up there?

573
00:36:51,054 --> 00:36:52,700
What we look like if we didn't go?

574
00:36:55,572 --> 00:36:56,502
Did you relax?

575
00:36:56,919 --> 00:36:57,722
Relax.

576
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:00,832
Yeah, I just take it out on Karen later.

577
00:37:01,369 --> 00:37:03,045
I more I'm willing it, the more impugn shot us.

578
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,114
Sounds like fun.

579
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,950
Hey, you wanna take over my hands?

580
00:37:05,978 --> 00:37:10,622
Be careful, partner.
Because I'm really special affected on women.

581
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:11,801
Go violent.

582
00:37:11,875 --> 00:37:12,806
Never.

583
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:16,082
You know, I can't look at the face
of that piece of shit, like an idiot.

584
00:37:17,053 --> 00:37:19,076
Fuck him, he's where he belongs.

585
00:37:19,723 --> 00:37:20,937
Sorry about him, I'm really sorry.

586
00:37:22,596 --> 00:37:23,567
Stop pulling about it.

587
00:37:26,463 --> 00:37:29,762
Whatever happens, I'm not gonna
take down with me.

588
00:37:29,797 --> 00:37:32,560
Don't worry about me, I'm all right.
Believe me.

589
00:37:32,952 --> 00:37:35,621
I don't know what I'm thinking,
I just don't know how to think it.

590
00:37:36,026 --> 00:37:37,124
You know what were you thinking?

591
00:37:37,656 --> 00:37:41,668
You were thinking about a ten year old girl...
had her skull crashed.

592
00:37:42,527 --> 00:37:46,226
Yeah, I tried to stop you...
But you know what? I admired you that day.

593
00:37:46,786 --> 00:37:47,474
What you did...

594
00:37:49,699 --> 00:37:51,081
...that was righteous.

595
00:37:52,102 --> 00:37:55,260
And you don't second guess yourself
or something like that.

596
00:38:02,806 --> 00:38:04,200
Okay, I'm the killer.

597
00:38:04,626 --> 00:38:07,083
I'm the killer, I showed up.
I shot the door.

598
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:11,823
Or your car window.
Having some reasons, you opened your door.

599
00:38:11,827 --> 00:38:14,348
You rolled down the car window...
for me.

600
00:38:14,954 --> 00:38:16,556
So? Who am I?

601
00:38:17,167 --> 00:38:18,248
Someone I know.

602
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,878
Maybe nice of the tits.

603
00:38:21,838 --> 00:38:23,005
The poems, what about the poems.

604
00:38:23,369 --> 00:38:25,183
You have to compose the poem
before you got there, right?

605
00:38:25,288 --> 00:38:28,657
Otherwise, well, you gonna blow the guy's brains,
and sit down and write down the sonata?

606
00:38:28,761 --> 00:38:30,437
There's no prints on the poems.

607
00:38:30,437 --> 00:38:33,649
So, probably I wore gloves when I wrote.

608
00:38:33,754 --> 00:38:36,690
You obviously know your victims,
be turned to an easy access,

609
00:38:36,795 --> 00:38:38,672
I guess they know you too, they must.

610
00:38:38,775 --> 00:38:41,720
These guys are all scoundrels.
They're not gonna trust anyone.

611
00:38:41,772 --> 00:38:44,388
They're not gonna open the door for anyone,
especially they don't know.

612
00:38:44,491 --> 00:38:45,768
Yeah, yeah, but I'm more than know them.

613
00:38:47,276 --> 00:38:50,692
I know everything about them, I know their moves, their patterns, I know their schedules.

614
00:38:50,807 --> 00:38:53,047
Okay, so you follow them, stick them out.

615
00:39:07,416 --> 00:39:09,116
Anyone gonna say it?

616
00:39:10,647 --> 00:39:11,382
What?

617
00:39:15,821 --> 00:39:16,909
Fuck me.

618
00:39:18,767 --> 00:39:20,730
- Right, it's a cop.
- It's not.

619
00:39:21,002 --> 00:39:22,828
Let's slow down before
we get away ahead our sight...

620
00:39:22,932 --> 00:39:25,997
- Come on! It's a cop. You know it.
- Na, not cop. I don't know shit.

621
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:29,276
I'm telling you now, it's a cop.
It's a cop, it's a cop.

622
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:32,533
It ain't no cop, it's a cop, it's a cop.
Why you keep always saying it's a cop, it's a cop...

623
00:39:32,637 --> 00:39:35,678
- Easy..., he's just saying that...
- What are you talking about?

624
00:39:36,892 --> 00:39:37,850
I know what he's saying!

625
00:39:42,311 --> 00:39:43,692
And I'm saying it's bullshit!

626
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:47,687
It should be, with the fuck...
but don't say it's a cop.

627
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:08,051
So, what about dinner?

628
00:40:09,439 --> 00:40:10,496
I'm feeling like going out.

629
00:40:11,595 --> 00:40:12,243
Where?

630
00:40:13,011 --> 00:40:14,219
I don't care, you're the one going.

631
00:40:15,328 --> 00:40:16,119
What is your problem?

632
00:40:16,808 --> 00:40:17,778
No problme.

633
00:40:18,604 --> 00:40:20,593
If you like hanging around, be my guest.

634
00:40:20,691 --> 00:40:21,824
I don't feel like going out.

635
00:40:21,898 --> 00:40:22,499
Fine.

636
00:40:23,371 --> 00:40:28,037
Just don't bug me, it's the part of my day
and I don't need your fucking help.

637
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,220
So, you only fuck cops?

638
00:40:34,421 --> 00:40:36,895
Once in a while,
do a fireman and an ex-con.

639
00:40:38,847 --> 00:40:40,357
Not one person you got, ha?

640
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:42,617
I love some respectful fireman.

641
00:40:42,618 --> 00:40:43,660
Fuck you.

642
00:40:44,616 --> 00:40:47,211
You know why they take away your
espantoon when hanging up your uniform?

643
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:47,910
No.

644
00:40:49,091 --> 00:40:50,352
They don't trust you with it.

645
00:40:50,993 --> 00:40:54,629
And now I wouldn't trus myself either,
sure you probably love that.

646
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,517
Too bad you never met Van Luytens,
you two really were ahead of great.

647
00:40:58,621 --> 00:41:02,547
That somebody finnal brought Jonathan(Luytens) down,
the dick little fuck.

648
00:41:03,137 --> 00:41:05,019
And that, that's what I like to meet.

649
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:06,692
Maybe you're gonna get your wish one day.

650
00:41:07,286 --> 00:41:08,640
They think it's a cop.

651
00:41:08,848 --> 00:41:12,590
- Make sense.
- Bullshit. That' just some fucking,  psychopath.

652
00:41:12,592 --> 00:41:14,260
Oh..
There is plenty of those on the job.

653
00:41:23,169 --> 00:41:24,302
You sleeping well?

654
00:41:24,302 --> 00:41:25,353
- Not really.
- Yeah.

655
00:41:25,353 --> 00:41:27,052
Eating well?

656
00:41:27,052 --> 00:41:28,063
- No.
- Yeah.

657
00:41:28,063 --> 00:41:32,315
- Any recuring nightmares?
- Yeah, then I'm stuck in a room with you forever.

658
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,453
Nope.

659
00:41:34,557 --> 00:41:36,233
You think it fit if return to the duty?

660
00:41:36,476 --> 00:41:38,234
- Abso-fucking-lutely.
- Yeah.

661
00:41:38,338 --> 00:41:39,974
- Have you thinked about retirement?
- You mean...

662
00:41:40,232 --> 00:41:41,787
death with benefits?

663
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,314
Or something like?

664
00:41:43,314 --> 00:41:44,487
Did you think about retirement?

665
00:41:44,591 --> 00:41:45,112
Not really.

666
00:41:45,738 --> 00:41:49,283
What do I look forward?
Sailing my 26 shipset in the bay?

667
00:41:49,595 --> 00:41:50,954
Umpire of cop softball?

668
00:41:51,093 --> 00:41:52,578
How about a cop security work?

669
00:41:52,788 --> 00:41:54,248
- Too dangerous.
- So what are you gonna do?

670
00:41:54,624 --> 00:41:55,917
Maybe I buy a boat.

671
00:41:56,823 --> 00:42:00,488
All right, look, I don't if I believe this,
but I'm gonna just throw this out that you guys say...

672
00:42:00,517 --> 00:42:02,800
We are looking for one of our own.

673
00:42:03,204 --> 00:42:04,742
But what if it was an ex-cop?

674
00:42:04,874 --> 00:42:06,642
Somebody wears an ex-uniform.

675
00:42:07,601 --> 00:42:08,827
You got one in your mind?

676
00:42:08,827 --> 00:42:11,902
He's thinking about Martin Baum.

677
00:42:12,946 --> 00:42:13,676
An old Lieutenant.

678
00:42:15,796 --> 00:42:17,039
So what' the doing with him?

679
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:18,772
He got fired a few years ago.

680
00:42:18,773 --> 00:42:22,120
I'm not saying there is a motive,
but he knows all the victims.

681
00:42:23,027 --> 00:42:25,574
Yeah, but Turk, I knew most of these guys.

682
00:42:26,181 --> 00:42:29,083
So and you, Riley, Perez, even Corelli.

683
00:42:29,128 --> 00:42:30,237
I just thew it out there.

684
00:42:30,341 --> 00:42:31,340
Maybe you killed them.

685
00:42:31,444 --> 00:42:33,341
Yeah, I did.

686
00:42:34,283 --> 00:42:37,832
Poems, and the place of the weapon,
is the all we got linked to the kills.

687
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,866
Which means what we gotta do now is
getting hope on the forensics.

688
00:42:41,496 --> 00:42:45,154
Let's deal with your poem,
We already got your girl working on that.

689
00:42:45,258 --> 00:42:49,321
That's right, Cowcen, we've been a long week,
that was big.

690
00:42:49,766 --> 00:42:50,332
What did you say?

691
00:42:52,032 --> 00:42:52,841
Ha, here we go again.

692
00:42:53,123 --> 00:42:54,094
Watch you mouth.

693
00:42:54,094 --> 00:42:57,088
Leave anything about it,
Karen and Simon are just history, don't woryy about it.

694
00:42:57,088 --> 00:42:58,504
Well, he's just speaking for himself?

695
00:42:58,504 --> 00:43:01,449
Yeah, I just speak for myself.
Let me speak for myself please. Fuck you! Turk!

696
00:43:01,458 --> 00:43:04,006
Well I'm gonna let you
have this fucking ball...

697
00:43:04,362 --> 00:43:06,959
- You better more than that.
- You, put your balls in your pocket.

698
00:43:07,566 --> 00:43:09,103
And you, fellow officers.

699
00:43:09,548 --> 00:43:11,733
You, curtsey for the fellow professional.

700
00:43:13,391 --> 00:43:13,998
Please!

701
00:43:15,049 --> 00:43:16,142
We're gonna move on here now?

702
00:43:17,113 --> 00:43:18,206
Here we are going, where were we?

703
00:43:18,691 --> 00:43:22,204
- Talking about Martin Baum.
- What's the story.

704
00:43:22,735 --> 00:43:26,659
Some guys I knew got caught taking money.
Baum stood off to them, tried to cover it up.

705
00:43:27,306 --> 00:43:27,995
He do time?

706
00:43:29,168 --> 00:43:31,959
Well they put charges on him,
then he plead and resigned.

707
00:43:32,444 --> 00:43:33,415
So what's the big for deal?

708
00:43:33,415 --> 00:43:35,964
I could have lied to protect him,
but I didin't.

709
00:43:36,328 --> 00:43:39,726
Okay, but there's gotta be for deal.
Why not go after you? Why not kill you?

710
00:43:39,726 --> 00:43:43,165
Why going out there like a serial killer?
It doesn't make sense.

711
00:43:43,165 --> 00:43:46,008
- How do I know, I'm just telling you.
- Well, I'm telling you, it doesn't make any sense.

712
00:43:46,008 --> 00:43:48,343
I'm throwing that out, I'm saying.

713
00:43:48,585 --> 00:43:51,174
- You wanna check that out, I won't give a shit.
- It doesn't make any sense.

714
00:43:51,174 --> 00:43:54,569
You are the one think he's a cop.
I'm just saying he's cop with a chip on his shoulder.

715
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:55,509
Check it out if you want...

716
00:43:55,601 --> 00:43:59,515
Just calm down, give us a better reason
that Baum could be a suspect, okay?

717
00:44:02,421 --> 00:44:04,248
PMS, gotta be.

718
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,170
Hey, guys.

719
00:44:13,141 --> 00:44:13,829
What's going on?

720
00:44:14,597 --> 00:44:17,672
Oh, I came over here bringing you the
FBI report in the paper and handwriting.

721
00:44:18,157 --> 00:44:20,691
You don't have any problem with me
looking around inside?

722
00:44:20,796 --> 00:44:22,882
Collect and process for your deal.

723
00:44:23,254 --> 00:44:23,982
No problem.

724
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:26,126
- Put them back.
- I mean, this is fascinating.

725
00:44:28,569 --> 00:44:30,652
Come on, come on.
Let's go, let's go. Come on, let's go.

726
00:44:30,697 --> 00:44:32,517
Hey, get your hands off me.

727
00:44:32,842 --> 00:44:35,258
Ah, I'll give you a little privacy.
I don't want to obstruct you.

728
00:44:35,372 --> 00:44:37,709
You are afraid of me looking at these files?
Ah? Is that it?

729
00:44:37,919 --> 00:44:39,483
Okay, I'm gone.
Enjoy it.

730
00:44:39,597 --> 00:44:42,187
What is it with you?
What is it with you?!

731
00:44:47,365 --> 00:44:49,265
I'm sorry about last night, okay?

732
00:44:50,439 --> 00:44:55,906
I really am, it's a habit.
Habits can be broken, all right?

733
00:44:56,709 --> 00:44:58,179
- Oh, that's bullshit.
- No.

734
00:44:59,177 --> 00:45:00,553
I'm totally serious, all right?

735
00:45:03,101 --> 00:45:04,558
It's not bullshit.

736
00:45:06,013 --> 00:45:06,823
Really.

737
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:17,502
Why you think Turk was so cool to
take the lead on the poetry boy case?

738
00:45:17,907 --> 00:45:21,750
To keep us from finding the killer man.
That's what I'll do if I'll cover my tracks.

739
00:45:22,033 --> 00:45:24,541
He takes us on this Baum state,
'cause he wants us to miss direction.

740
00:45:24,905 --> 00:45:25,674
Make sense.

741
00:45:25,876 --> 00:45:27,697
I hate that Turk man.

742
00:45:57,239 --> 00:45:58,847
Hey, it's coming here, coming here.

743
00:46:02,042 --> 00:46:03,296
It's 2:45 in the moring.

744
00:46:07,221 --> 00:46:09,364
It's the killing time?
I don't think it's the killing time.

745
00:46:30,259 --> 00:46:32,180
Come on, Baum, go to kill someone in there.

746
00:46:32,624 --> 00:46:35,658
Yeah, kill Turk, man, he's the one set you up.
Do us all the favour.

747
00:46:42,334 --> 00:46:44,582
Did you see Turk's full mark
scores record these years?

748
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:47,431
It's ridiculous.
Service in 99, 70 yard in 100.

749
00:46:47,997 --> 00:46:50,949
Combat association award,
department commedations.

750
00:46:51,157 --> 00:46:53,499
This guy can take your life in more than 50 yards.

751
00:46:56,821 --> 00:46:59,878
Through the computer to check this man,
a one straight look.

752
00:47:08,022 --> 00:47:11,581
- What about Corelli, she came up with anything new?
- No, not yet.

753
00:47:11,903 --> 00:47:15,829
If Baum kills somebody, I don't wanna speak
in the car and wait when it happens, okay?

754
00:47:19,139 --> 00:47:19,796
I'll go.

755
00:47:19,797 --> 00:47:23,655
Attaboy, Teddy, attaboy.
I'm proud of you, son.

756
00:47:35,696 --> 00:47:36,986
You are Perez, right?

757
00:47:37,112 --> 00:47:38,241
Yeah.

758
00:47:38,245 --> 00:47:39,771
I'm Martin Baum.

759
00:47:43,464 --> 00:47:45,199
I got a permit for this.

760
00:47:46,451 --> 00:47:48,328
I worked as security for the
Dimmer District.

761
00:47:49,059 --> 00:47:51,457
So, you figure it's a cop
doing the poetry killings?

762
00:47:51,667 --> 00:47:54,065
So, "let's check out Baum",
"I think he's gotten wrong deal".

763
00:47:54,587 --> 00:47:56,256
So that's sort of words he says?

764
00:47:57,299 --> 00:47:58,863
- Do you think he got the wrong deal?
- Damn straight.

765
00:48:00,324 --> 00:48:01,784
- Life sucks.
- Yeah.

766
00:48:02,306 --> 00:48:05,017
- Everything is okay? Simon?
- Teddy, what the fuck where you, man?

767
00:48:05,019 --> 00:48:07,208
- How are you doing?
- I think you want to tell us someting, Lieutenant Baum.

768
00:48:08,043 --> 00:48:09,607
I got something for you in my pocket.

769
00:48:12,841 --> 00:48:17,533
Passport, credit card receipts,
boarding passes...

770
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:21,705
The day he was killed,
I was escorting a client to Brazili.

771
00:48:34,219 --> 00:48:38,181
"If he is truelly penitent,
sincere absolution,"

772
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:40,901
"It must be granted to him."

773
00:48:40,936 --> 00:48:43,273
"Your name doesn't ring your bell."

774
00:48:43,483 --> 00:48:47,237
"But I had so many altar boys
over the years."

775
00:48:51,279 --> 00:48:56,176
So many altar boys that so hard
to remember their names.

776
00:48:56,348 --> 00:49:00,100
My name is Detective David Fisk,
Detective first grade.

777
00:49:00,383 --> 00:49:05,115
You may not remeber me now, but I guarantee you'll remeber my name for you rest of you life.

778
00:49:05,763 --> 00:49:08,999
Farther Connel, may him rot in hell.

779
00:49:09,097 --> 00:49:12,478
Thirteen down, one to go.

780
00:49:19,828 --> 00:49:22,306
White underwear, blue overknee.

781
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:27,895
Same style, where's the treaters?

782
00:49:28,417 --> 00:49:31,729
I am removing a card that has been inserted
into the rump of the deceased.

783
00:49:32,877 --> 00:49:35,380
And placing it into an plastic evidence bag.

784
00:49:39,582 --> 00:49:41,645
- I'll be right back.
- All right.

785
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:48,360
Hey. It's another one, handwritten.

786
00:49:52,365 --> 00:49:58,797
THE OLD MAN WHO THE CHILDREN TRUST.
UNABLE TO CONTROL HIS LUST.

787
00:49:58,797 --> 00:50:01,952
ASHES TO ASHES, DUST TO DUST.

788
00:50:02,154 --> 00:50:06,888
THE CHURCH CAN'T SOPT HIM
SOMEONE MUST.

789
00:50:07,124 --> 00:50:10,610
I'll see what else I can find.

790
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:16,961
What's my ringing?

791
00:50:17,406 --> 00:50:21,491
Farther Connel gave my first communion...
back in Benslus.

792
00:50:25,133 --> 00:50:28,450
- Hey, guys, sorry we didn't got a chance to call.
- Okay, I bet you are.

793
00:50:28,450 --> 00:50:31,888
Go over there, check and look around,
we compare notes later. Okay?

794
00:50:32,213 --> 00:50:35,481
Look like our friend settled an old score to Priest.

795
00:50:35,483 --> 00:50:37,672
- Left him pants down.
- Oh, come on.

796
00:50:37,673 --> 00:50:40,667
- Oh, look.
- Come on, don't talk like that.

797
00:50:40,667 --> 00:50:42,933
Hey, look at it yourself.

798
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:47,377
Listen, he's gonna tell us that
Lieutenat Baum was the altar boy here.

799
00:50:47,585 --> 00:50:50,740
Don't even buy it,
this two guys just fucking stink.

800
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:55,513
Look, Doctor, you got the poems,
it is possible, right?... that this guy is a cop.

801
00:50:55,836 --> 00:51:00,732
Na, I've never seen it. I've never even heard about a cop serial killer.

802
00:51:00,732 --> 00:51:03,442
Come on, girls. Let's go, let's go.

803
00:51:04,089 --> 00:51:07,972
Go, go, go...

804
00:51:09,186 --> 00:51:11,816
Doc., give us a tip.
How can we catch this guy?

805
00:51:12,018 --> 00:51:16,064
Not to worry about that.
He wants to get caught.

806
00:51:18,087 --> 00:51:20,312
You want any better place for lunch?

807
00:51:20,312 --> 00:51:23,912
- I want to thank you.
- About spider?

808
00:51:24,478 --> 00:51:29,980
Yeah, and for looking after me at the hospital.
And your encouragement.

809
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:33,459
- Why would he want that?
- After while getting away with it isn't enough.

810
00:51:33,782 --> 00:51:35,441
So, is your daughter in the team?

811
00:51:35,441 --> 00:51:39,689
No, she used to play, bu not she's 25 living in California.

812
00:51:40,134 --> 00:51:43,168
- Working as a nurse.
- And her mother?

813
00:51:43,613 --> 00:51:46,647
Her mother died when she was very young.

814
00:51:46,889 --> 00:51:50,126
He wants everybody to know
that he got away with it.

815
00:51:50,328 --> 00:51:53,002
Show everybody just how brilliant he is.

816
00:51:53,106 --> 00:51:56,457
Most of these killings acquitted
right front of Rooster and his face, right?

817
00:51:56,562 --> 00:51:59,583
And he also threatened to kill the lams in front of a hundred of witness,

818
00:51:59,867 --> 00:52:02,814
then he make this crazy bullshit sounds going after Lieutenant Baum.

819
00:52:02,919 --> 00:52:04,170
- Right? Did he?
- Yes, he did.

820
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:06,028
- Why?Why?...
- You, you, ...

821
00:52:06,133 --> 00:52:08,033
You gotta show me more than than that,
so far you got shit.

822
00:52:08,108 --> 00:52:11,485
- Give him more, man.
- You want more? How about the church records?

823
00:52:11,485 --> 00:52:14,196
There was that Turk so diligently pursuing.

824
00:52:14,519 --> 00:52:17,594
Now turns out, our most recently victim, the Farther Connel, has moved...

825
00:52:17,594 --> 00:52:21,841
... all over the places, eight parish in twenty years. Why would he do that as a Catholic priest?

826
00:52:22,084 --> 00:52:25,563
It's obviously. He's giving the children
more than communion behind the altar.

827
00:52:25,766 --> 00:52:28,880
Turk already even knows it when this guy
was a child. It's very plausible.

828
00:52:31,469 --> 00:52:35,474
So, this priest, Farther Connel, gave you the
first Holy Communion?

829
00:52:35,474 --> 00:52:39,641
- He did.
- Did he ever try to do anything in improper?

830
00:52:39,641 --> 00:52:42,757
- I mean...
- I know what you mean, no, never.

831
00:52:43,767 --> 00:52:48,298
Okay, fine. Is there any reason why somebody out there might think that he did.

832
00:52:48,298 --> 00:52:53,030
No, am I a suspect?
Lieutenant?

833
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:58,532
No, but these buddies are starting to smell...,

834
00:52:58,809 --> 00:53:02,011
a lof of it is drifting in your direction.

835
00:53:02,011 --> 00:53:05,814
- Drifting or being pushed?
- What can I say?

836
00:53:05,865 --> 00:53:10,835
You got connections with most of the victims.
You are not exactly Mother Teresa.

837
00:53:13,379 --> 00:53:17,627
- I never had any problem with that priest.
- Okay, okay, fine.

838
00:53:18,643 --> 00:53:19,987
Let's settle this.

839
00:53:27,184 --> 00:53:30,936
- I had a talk with Riley and Perez.
- Good cops.

840
00:53:30,936 --> 00:53:34,698
-Don't fuck around, okay? Just listen.
- I'm listening.

841
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:38,016
They think Turk maybe our guy.

842
00:53:41,738 --> 00:53:46,308
Oh, man, I gotta tell you from where I'm sitting
that is so fucking funny.

843
00:53:46,308 --> 00:53:48,654
You can't take that seriously? Right?

844
00:53:48,654 --> 00:53:52,579
Everybody has pretty much accepted that
that fact we are chasing one of our own.

845
00:53:52,781 --> 00:53:55,572
But it ain't Turk.
Sure as I'm sitting here ain't the guy.

846
00:53:55,572 --> 00:53:57,594
- You know that?
- Yes, I do.

847
00:53:57,796 --> 00:54:00,021
- How do you know that?
- Because I know it.

848
00:54:00,264 --> 00:54:03,865
I know it to a moral certainty. Okay?

849
00:54:05,362 --> 00:54:12,077
This priest, this father Connel, he was
Turk's priest when he was a kid.

850
00:54:12,077 --> 00:54:15,516
- He told you that.
- But he didn't tell me this priest was a child molester.

851
00:54:15,758 --> 00:54:17,349
- I can't believe it.
- Believe it.

852
00:54:18,497 --> 00:54:20,478
Turk is a good guy.
He is one of the best cops.

853
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:23,149
Don't tell me what I gotta do!

854
00:54:23,264 --> 00:54:28,137
Don't say a god damn word to him
about this either, or you're finished.

855
00:54:37,685 --> 00:54:40,839
- Can I speak now?
- Do pray.

856
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:46,058
He cares. You know what I'm saying?

857
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:50,103
Turk cares about people.

858
00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:54,634
I know he once around like pitbull on crack sometimes, it doesn't matter.

859
00:54:55,564 --> 00:54:58,396
He cares about protecting people.

860
00:54:58,639 --> 00:55:02,725
And if you don't back him,
you will regret it.

861
00:55:25,582 --> 00:55:28,656
- Oh, Jesus!
- I'm sorry.

862
00:55:28,725 --> 00:55:32,499
I never rattled anyone caged before.
You got a minute?

863
00:55:32,904 --> 00:55:35,291
Yeah, what's up?

864
00:55:36,059 --> 00:55:37,846
You know me and Turk are buddies, right?

865
00:55:38,264 --> 00:55:40,246
- Of course.
- I'll do anything for him.

866
00:55:41,398 --> 00:55:44,189
He will do anything for you.

867
00:55:44,189 --> 00:55:46,563
- Would you?
- Would I what?

868
00:55:46,668 --> 00:55:49,610
Would you do anything for him?

869
00:55:52,199 --> 00:55:54,545
I don't know,..., I..., where is this going?

870
00:55:54,545 --> 00:56:00,128
- He wants to have sex on me.
- Really?

871
00:56:02,798 --> 00:56:06,965
You wouldn't mind.
But that's not why I'm here.

872
00:56:07,289 --> 00:56:09,150
Okay, why are you here?

873
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:12,709
Where were you the night Rambo was killed?

874
00:56:12,709 --> 00:56:16,957
And Trager, any alibi for those nights?

875
00:56:17,564 --> 00:56:19,873
I mean did you even know these guys
before they were murdered?

876
00:56:20,187 --> 00:56:23,002
- Well, now I learned.
- You can't be comfortable when I talk like that.

877
00:56:23,349 --> 00:56:25,380
And you look like you are guilty while you are not guilty.

878
00:56:25,381 --> 00:56:28,510
I know that, you didn't kill those guys, didn't you?

879
00:56:31,676 --> 00:56:35,161
Now you know what Turk feels.

880
00:56:39,136 --> 00:56:44,303
I need you to get me some information...discreetly.

881
00:56:46,408 --> 00:56:48,064
Would you do that for me?

882
00:56:48,273 --> 00:56:54,741
- You got it, absolutely.
- Solve these fucking murders.

883
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:01,114
- Hey, boy genius.
- Pefect time, buddy.

884
00:57:01,316 --> 00:57:05,321
Listen, you really worked on Hingis, didn't you?
He was on work boubt my partner.

885
00:57:05,321 --> 00:57:06,697
Good, he should be.

886
00:57:06,697 --> 00:57:09,529
I think we should just sit down and
see what we can do to square things, okay?

887
00:57:09,731 --> 00:57:14,746
- All right, then we meet at Trails at eight pm.
- Can you make that nine?

888
00:57:14,989 --> 00:57:18,388
- I gotta meet an old friend.
- Yeah sure, whatever you want.

889
00:57:27,450 --> 00:57:29,230
Hey, fellows.

890
00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:31,858
Thanks for coming.

891
00:57:32,505 --> 00:57:34,932
- This is Cheryl Brooks.
- Helllo Cheryl Brooks.

892
00:57:34,932 --> 00:57:37,643
Cheryl got something to tell you.

893
00:57:39,666 --> 00:57:44,479
My daughter, Lynn, died four years ago.

894
00:57:44,479 --> 00:57:48,484
She was ten years old, she was raped,
and she was murdered.

895
00:57:49,455 --> 00:57:54,391
The guy was, living with me, name Charles.

896
00:57:54,391 --> 00:57:57,708
- Charles Randall.
- Yeah, Charles Randall, he did it.

897
00:57:59,529 --> 00:58:02,563
- So why are you telling us this?
- Because he got off for that.

898
00:58:02,563 --> 00:58:04,181
He was acquitted in trial.

899
00:58:04,181 --> 00:58:06,609
- Because...?
- Because...

900
00:58:08,873 --> 00:58:11,503
- I testified for him.
- You did what?

901
00:58:11,746 --> 00:58:13,476
I said he was with me.

902
00:58:15,458 --> 00:58:20,046
You see, Cheryl here is a very forgiving person...
unlike her hard asses.

903
00:58:20,727 --> 00:58:23,518
- He threatened to kill me.
- Okay, Cheryl, okay.

904
00:58:23,761 --> 00:58:27,077
You say "goodbye" to the nice officers.

905
00:58:27,077 --> 00:58:32,296
Here go on, back home,
and don't drink youself to dead.

906
00:58:35,532 --> 00:58:39,052
Okay, ..., so...

907
00:58:43,259 --> 00:58:48,396
I wanna hear you to say it.
Come on, say it.

908
00:58:53,008 --> 00:58:57,054
We planted the gun in Randall's apartment. Okay?

909
00:58:57,054 --> 00:59:00,290
- I said it. Happy?
- Thank you.

910
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:02,880
- Yes, I am.
- I'll do it again if I had to.

911
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:07,855
Because that fucking maggot could run away
for all eternity. I sleep just fine.

912
00:59:07,855 --> 00:59:09,109
So what you want from us?

913
00:59:09,352 --> 00:59:11,779
Well, you guys think
my partner is this serial killer.

914
00:59:12,102 --> 00:59:17,321
You are way off.
You like Turk for this thing? Go have your fun.

915
00:59:17,321 --> 00:59:21,164
I'll go along with you. I even help you.

916
00:59:22,176 --> 00:59:25,411
But do not drag off Charles Randall
at that fucking gun.

917
00:59:25,653 --> 00:59:30,144
Because if he walked out of jail,
he's gonna end of dead.

918
00:59:30,144 --> 00:59:32,531
Excuse me?

919
00:59:32,854 --> 00:59:35,597
I'll put tools to his fucking head...,

920
00:59:36,328 --> 00:59:37,370
...myself.

921
00:59:39,144 --> 00:59:40,009
Done deal.

922
00:59:54,012 --> 00:59:59,028
My grandmother loved opera...,
she supported us by sewing.

923
00:59:59,028 --> 01:00:01,978
I used to thread needles...,
for my grand mother.

924
01:00:01,979 --> 01:00:03,335
Devote all the money to church.

925
01:00:03,438 --> 01:00:06,553
- You admired her?
- I worshiped her.

926
01:00:06,755 --> 01:00:09,537
Rooster? Has religious, goes to church.

927
01:00:09,538 --> 01:00:10,581
How about you?

928
01:00:11,448 --> 01:00:16,303
"Our job is to keep 99% of the population
safe from the other 1%."

929
01:00:18,406 --> 01:00:21,844
"The problem is we have spent
half of our life with that 1%,"

930
01:00:22,046 --> 01:00:26,901
"and the better we do that job,
the less the other 99% think they need us."

931
01:00:27,103 --> 01:00:28,099
They clueless.

932
01:00:28,830 --> 01:00:31,937
"The only ones are paying attention on the street
are the cops and the criminals."

933
01:00:31,957 --> 01:00:36,246
"Everyone else just going somewhere...,
or shopping."

934
01:00:43,972 --> 01:00:47,128
I got an order here,
placing you on a more strict duty.

935
01:00:47,370 --> 01:00:51,045
That means you work at your desk.
You may want to cooperate with the shrink.

936
01:00:51,149 --> 01:00:55,340
Next time you want to meet,
And you two will meet again.

937
01:00:58,374 --> 01:01:01,529
Who my fucking heals...,
who my fucking heals?!

938
01:01:01,853 --> 01:01:06,789
I'm gonna fucking hole that mother fuck Perez a bullet right through his fucking head for puting through this bullshit.

939
01:01:07,112 --> 01:01:09,863
Fuck! I'm gonna kill that mother fucker.

940
01:01:09,863 --> 01:01:12,574
Calm down, what hell is it?
You are making all the wrong move.

941
01:01:12,574 --> 01:01:14,636
What are you talking about?
This ain't just a chess game, partner!

942
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:16,092
Who knows, maybe it is.

943
01:01:16,294 --> 01:01:19,409
You go after Perez now, you know who's gonna happy?
You're gonna walk right into his trap.

944
01:01:19,692 --> 01:01:22,484
You ARE!
He's just waiting for you.

945
01:01:22,686 --> 01:01:26,691
Fuck Hingis, fuck Hingls believe him.

946
01:01:26,974 --> 01:01:28,876
actually fucking believe that mother fucker Perez.

947
01:01:28,876 --> 01:01:32,719
Stay back, wait.
Wait for the right time...,

948
01:01:32,921 --> 01:01:36,076
...then fire away.
Not now, now is not the right time.

949
01:01:36,077 --> 01:01:37,120
Believe me.

950
01:01:37,935 --> 01:01:40,527
You believe me?
Now is not the time.

951
01:01:44,412 --> 01:01:47,551
Hey, Turk, I gotta skip tonight.
My class run late.

952
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:49,134
But I will see you tomorrow, right?

953
01:01:49,376 --> 01:01:52,410
And I'm sorry about what happened between
you and Lieutenant Hingis yesterday.

954
01:01:52,653 --> 01:01:57,184
It's gonna be fine, it will blow over.
People will just..., I know it's cary, people over reacting.

955
01:01:58,034 --> 01:02:01,351
All right? Good night.

956
01:02:07,217 --> 01:02:10,251
"It's a cop, it's a cop, it's a cop..."

957
01:02:18,624 --> 01:02:21,173
What you got for me, goodlooking?

958
01:02:25,946 --> 01:02:28,859
Mark my words, there is a reason
Perez coming for me.

959
01:02:29,142 --> 01:02:31,569
Perez is too smart to be that stupid.

960
01:02:31,812 --> 01:02:34,320
For one thing that college boy crapped?
That's bullshit.

961
01:02:34,522 --> 01:02:37,354
- He did one year, that's all, only one year.
- Okay.

962
01:02:37,597 --> 01:02:39,700
They threw him up, threw out the influence.

963
01:02:40,025 --> 01:02:44,798
And I hear from the 2-40 Mister Dabet and Captain Larry
the guy is totally fucking ass hole.

964
01:02:45,081 --> 01:02:49,337

(Talking about Car Wars Game)

965
01:02:49,338 --> 01:02:53,509
BMW 7th series, the biggest engine,
that's what I shut out begin.

966
01:02:53,698 --> 01:02:58,350
If they shoot at you,
you sure wanna get the fuck out there...

967
01:02:59,644 --> 01:03:01,749
Bentley is very good, because...

968
01:03:01,749 --> 01:03:04,499
... in fucked two prostitutes in the back seat.

969
01:03:04,499 --> 01:03:07,816
And mount flame thrower on hood.
Da. (Yeah?)

970
01:03:08,234 --> 01:03:08,860
Da.(Yeah.)

971
01:03:14,086 --> 01:03:15,085
Fuck..., fuck in the corner.
Are you kidding me?

972
01:03:15,086 --> 01:03:16,963
You know anyone of those neandertals?

973
01:03:16,997 --> 01:03:19,986
Yeah, the whuped is Johcey Ancey from Pansina,
a Gambino guy.

974
01:03:20,299 --> 01:03:21,238
And, what about Ivan?

975
01:03:21,489 --> 01:03:27,604
Russian guy, Yevgeny Mugalat,
enforce for Guyense, works for Gambino slogger.

976
01:03:32,614 --> 01:03:37,914
- She's against to me.
- I know she's against to you.

977
01:03:39,653 --> 01:03:44,629
She's against to me too, you know.
I take it in and let it out..., on my own terms.

978
01:03:46,045 --> 01:03:50,296
I bet you didn't write one word down on
that little notebook, Prosky gave us.

979
01:03:50,714 --> 01:03:51,757
Of course not, did you?

980
01:03:53,003 --> 01:03:56,158
Yeah, it's great.

981
01:03:56,442 --> 01:03:59,386
It helps me,
puts things in perspective.

982
01:03:59,596 --> 01:04:02,828
You know what I'm saying?
Write it down, get it out.

983
01:04:03,764 --> 01:04:06,396
- You should try this.
- Let me have a look.

984
01:04:08,091 --> 01:04:11,813
This belongs to me, private.

985
01:04:12,096 --> 01:04:15,454
- You won't let see it?
- It's my heart. No, sir.

986
01:04:15,454 --> 01:04:19,742
I just got sick of the whole fucking game.
Run around, looking for clues, making arrest.

987
01:04:19,742 --> 01:04:25,002
Write report, testify, got deals,
with all those so much fucking bullshit.

988
01:04:28,602 --> 01:04:30,384
Detective...

989
01:04:35,196 --> 01:04:36,652
Then it will get reall simple.

990
01:04:36,652 --> 01:04:39,524
Yeah, Detective Perez is here.
Hey, Riley, what's up?

991
01:04:39,727 --> 01:04:42,882
I hate scumbags, I like shooting people,
why was I giving up?

992
01:04:43,084 --> 01:04:46,199
Hey, look, I set for a meeting
with Rooster tomorrow.

993
01:04:46,564 --> 01:04:49,112
Yeah, fast.
I don't wanna Turk know anything.

994
01:04:49,435 --> 01:04:54,654
A retirement paryt? A gold watch? Handshake with mayor?
My name on some fucking plaque?

995
01:05:00,641 --> 01:05:05,455
What the fucking deal!
It's better this way.

996
01:05:06,789 --> 01:05:10,956
Now everybody knows who I was
and where I stood.

997
01:05:54,121 --> 01:05:56,589
Hey, it's me.

998
01:05:56,831 --> 01:06:00,795
Listen, I think somebody following me.
Here, home.

999
01:06:01,037 --> 01:06:03,505
He's outside right now. Can you..., ah...

1000
01:06:03,505 --> 01:06:08,158
...come over, just call me back, okay?

1001
01:06:08,158 --> 01:06:10,445
All right.

1002
01:06:55,073 --> 01:06:56,598
Come on, open the door.

1003
01:06:56,599 --> 01:06:57,642
Turk.

1004
01:07:04,429 --> 01:07:07,746
- I just called you.
- Put the gun down.

1005
01:07:08,110 --> 01:07:12,358
- There's car following me.
- Put the gun down! Put the gun down.

1006
01:07:16,281 --> 01:07:19,477
- Have you got something to tell me?
- About what?

1007
01:07:19,477 --> 01:07:23,887
- Trager, Randall...
- Did you sneak into my apartment...

1008
01:07:23,887 --> 01:07:26,435
What are you doing in your computer?

1009
01:07:26,435 --> 01:07:29,308
I was checking all the links in the case.

1010
01:07:31,776 --> 01:07:34,405
Are you hiding something from me?

1011
01:07:39,421 --> 01:07:42,334
Just received this, it's a poem.

1012
01:07:42,617 --> 01:07:45,369
A poem? That was mention, ha?

1013
01:07:45,571 --> 01:07:49,738
The handwriting, doesn't ever match.
It's a fake.

1014
01:07:50,829 --> 01:07:56,735
Well, did you write it?
Did you wite it?

1015
01:08:01,630 --> 01:08:02,906
What hell is this going on here?

1016
01:08:03,004 --> 01:08:05,259
You are spending a lot of time with Perez,
aren't you?

1017
01:08:05,260 --> 01:08:07,346
Yeah, but we are working on the case.

1018
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:11,945
- What..., are you jealous?
- Can I trust you?

1019
01:08:14,899 --> 01:08:16,072
- Yes.
- Okay.

1020
01:08:16,598 --> 01:08:20,672
Give me anything and everything that you can find out about Perez, Riley...

1021
01:08:20,770 --> 01:08:23,809
...and they know about me.

1022
01:08:24,052 --> 01:08:28,709
Everything, Karen, don't play me.

1023
01:08:29,316 --> 01:08:33,095
I am leaning much poor of you into saying
"that is a cop".

1024
01:08:33,095 --> 01:08:35,469
Well, tell you what,
I'm moving passed the leaning stage,

1025
01:08:35,470 --> 01:08:38,598
and moving towards the..., I know for sure,
to fucking cop stage.

1026
01:08:38,839 --> 01:08:41,671
...considering how your police
shot a shit out of my house.

1027
01:08:41,671 --> 01:08:43,255
Oh, my god, ..., are you hurt?

1028
01:08:43,464 --> 01:08:45,862
Am I hurt..., am I hurt,
he wants to know if am I hurt.

1029
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:48,427
Actually he's dead.

1030
01:08:50,045 --> 01:08:51,780
His name was Mugalat.

1031
01:08:51,781 --> 01:08:54,179
- The guy we saw at SALERNOS in the night.
- Yeah.

1032
01:08:54,333 --> 01:08:56,725
He's in the Intensive Case at St. Luke's.

1033
01:08:56,726 --> 01:08:59,959
They think he's the guy chopped off
Yakov Prosty's head.

1034
01:09:00,159 --> 01:09:02,910
So what do you think?
You think he's a victim or could be a suspect?

1035
01:09:03,152 --> 01:09:06,915
I don't know, but either way,
I think it's gonna be fun.

1036
01:09:07,602 --> 01:09:10,393
Doctor, what's the story?

1037
01:09:10,718 --> 01:09:13,440
The man is acest humanbeing
that I ever come into contact with.

1038
01:09:13,659 --> 01:09:16,503
- We took six bullets out of him.
- Six?!

1039
01:09:17,069 --> 01:09:20,265
Three for the night he was wounded,
three for previous shootings.

1040
01:09:20,265 --> 01:09:22,327
The was an ank(tank).

1041
01:09:22,570 --> 01:09:24,159
Do you mind if I talk to him a little bit?

1042
01:09:24,401 --> 01:09:27,587
- His jaws are very short. But go ahead.
- That's okay.

1043
01:09:27,789 --> 01:09:30,216
I'll ask questions, so he can just grunt.

1044
01:09:31,753 --> 01:09:38,509
Hey, wake up.
Wake up, you big fucking crazy man.

1045
01:09:39,399 --> 01:09:41,948
He wants me to speak Russian?

1046
01:09:53,315 --> 01:09:57,280
I think this Russian killing machine
could be our first eyewitness.

1047
01:09:58,615 --> 01:10:02,498
Wake up, Mugalat,
then you can tell us who did this to you.

1048
01:10:07,799 --> 01:10:09,781
Detective, I think that's enough.

1049
01:10:10,023 --> 01:10:14,514
Then you can tell us where you put
Yakov Prosty's head.

1050
01:10:16,455 --> 01:10:20,056
43, 43, I need the around the clock security
detail on a patient...

1051
01:10:20,056 --> 01:10:26,690
Magulat, M-A, gulat.
At St. Luke's ICU.

1052
01:10:31,505 --> 01:10:34,423
Is this the number I can call to report
the case of police brutality?

1053
01:10:35,884 --> 01:10:37,135
I can't get your tongue.

1054
01:10:37,168 --> 01:10:40,566
Come out on bail again? Well, you think you can scare me,
a little bitch, what you want?

1055
01:10:40,566 --> 01:10:43,231
Be careful, Detective, my taxes pay your salary.

1056
01:10:43,232 --> 01:10:45,526
You don't pay any fucking taxes,
you're only like a piece of shit.

1057
01:10:45,535 --> 01:10:46,722
Go to the point, come on.

1058
01:10:46,765 --> 01:10:50,831
One of your victims, Trager,
stolen a whole lot guns down in south.

1059
01:10:51,073 --> 01:10:53,220
Same guns turned up in your murder scenes.

1060
01:10:53,533 --> 01:10:57,260
So it' simple.
Find out who stolen the guns, you got your guy.

1061
01:10:57,365 --> 01:10:58,408
So you know the guy?

1062
01:10:58,609 --> 01:11:01,602
Yeah, you know, there's a cop I'll deal
who maybe a danger to the public.

1063
01:11:01,602 --> 01:11:04,353
I'm gonna live with myself,
I just don't buy any saying.

1064
01:11:04,637 --> 01:11:07,266
Look, I'm gonna give two seconds more,
give me a "Yes" or "No".

1065
01:11:07,508 --> 01:11:10,340
Do you know the guy?
And when do I meet you to talk about it?

1066
01:11:10,543 --> 01:11:14,427
- Firday, 9 pm, in my club.
- I'll be there.

1067
01:11:15,559 --> 01:11:18,796
It is dumb, dumb,
this is the mother fucker dumbest right here,man.

1068
01:11:18,796 --> 01:11:20,861
Easy son, easy,
this is gonna be easy for you.

1069
01:11:20,967 --> 01:11:24,230
All you got to do is being bait, that's all.
Be a little seduced for us, all right?

1070
01:11:24,499 --> 01:11:26,513
You helped us, we got you covered.

1071
01:11:26,514 --> 01:11:29,798
You club doesn't get harassed all day.
You don't have involved the door in and out of the jail.

1072
01:11:29,839 --> 01:11:31,418
Do we have the deal or not?

1073
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:35,209
Yeah, but your boy come in here and
got Hannibal Lecter on my ass,

1074
01:11:35,313 --> 01:11:37,580
I don't know if Jody fucking Foster
can come through the door.

1075
01:11:37,685 --> 01:11:39,458
When the god dam ring called, man.

1076
01:12:12,651 --> 01:12:14,541
Evening, Detective,
you want one?

1077
01:12:14,865 --> 01:12:17,171
It's a shit, but it's better that nothing, right?

1078
01:12:17,373 --> 01:12:20,246
"As soon I heard that fucking Russian didn't die,"

1079
01:12:20,528 --> 01:12:22,875
"I know things'll never be the same."

1080
01:12:23,199 --> 01:12:26,637
"I have to change the rules, the strategy."

1081
01:12:27,001 --> 01:12:31,209
"I have to be bold...,
do something that could never be undone."

1082
01:12:38,490 --> 01:12:42,051
"I went for the unforgivable."

1083
01:13:08,750 --> 01:13:11,663
Please, no...

1084
01:13:32,254 --> 01:13:35,895
Did you hear anything?!
I just said!!

1085
01:13:36,502 --> 01:13:40,507
How exactly could I be blowing
this out of proportion!?

1086
01:13:40,749 --> 01:13:43,056
That psychal just assaulted me!

1087
01:13:43,379 --> 01:13:45,968
I am telling he is a classic sociopath.

1088
01:13:46,251 --> 01:13:48,517
Okay, okay, I'll look into it.
All right? I'll look into it.

1089
01:13:49,528 --> 01:13:53,371
Now, you stay the hell away from there.
Understood? Understood?

1090
01:13:56,122 --> 01:13:58,306
Fuck that.

1091
01:14:15,753 --> 01:14:18,537
Excuse me, Ma'am, Detective Corelli,
Let me see your reservation.

1092
01:14:18,642 --> 01:14:19,581
Sure, help yourself.

1093
01:14:23,857 --> 01:14:25,525
"Mc Daved Fisk"

1094
01:14:28,283 --> 01:14:29,983
- Thank you.
- Any time.

1095
01:14:29,983 --> 01:14:31,369
Yes, this is Detective Corelli.

1096
01:14:31,370 --> 01:14:34,009
I've been trying to reach Dectective Perez and Riley.

1097
01:14:34,010 --> 01:14:36,095
And I can't locate them.

1098
01:14:36,941 --> 01:14:39,846
- I like to party
- I like to cuddle and kiss.

1099
01:14:41,431 --> 01:14:43,413
My tongue is hanging out,
spitting fake blood.

1100
01:14:43,414 --> 01:14:45,499
I need to speak to them urgently.

1101
01:14:48,747 --> 01:14:52,475
Yes, I understand, but can I...,
I need the location, please.

1102
01:15:20,231 --> 01:15:22,341
Hey, he's here.

1103
01:15:23,271 --> 01:15:24,849
Let me in.

1104
01:15:30,027 --> 01:15:32,252
Thank god, this is the police.

1105
01:15:32,495 --> 01:15:35,732
- Yeah, so..., where do we go?
- Follow me.

1106
01:15:36,702 --> 01:15:40,465
- Used to play ball coupla blocks from here.
- What the fuck out there...

1107
01:15:40,950 --> 01:15:42,820
When I was a kid,
I wasn't afraid of those guys like you.

1108
01:15:42,821 --> 01:15:44,489
Still ain't.

1109
01:15:45,238 --> 01:15:48,920
Now it's the Karen girl with me,
it's a bad neighborhood.

1110
01:15:50,214 --> 01:15:51,998
- Ain't bad for me.
- Yeah.

1111
01:15:51,999 --> 01:15:53,667
Yeah, he's inside.

1112
01:15:54,705 --> 01:15:56,553
Well, so far so good.

1113
01:15:56,877 --> 01:15:58,665
Stopped dallying the pleasant tree.

1114
01:15:58,666 --> 01:15:59,917
- What you got for me?
- Good, talk to him.

1115
01:16:01,015 --> 01:16:02,957
What do you think he's gonna do?

1116
01:16:04,547 --> 01:16:06,945
Oh, Christ, Lieutenant, this is a crack shit.

1117
01:16:07,003 --> 01:16:08,504
I lost three fucking teeth that day.

1118
01:16:08,851 --> 01:16:10,989
Well, he's not a civilian,
he's fucking dealer.

1119
01:16:12,221 --> 01:16:16,267
So what? You guys love those stupid gold teeth.
You should thank me.

1120
01:16:16,590 --> 01:16:21,282
Oh, he's wearing a vest. And Starsky and Hutch
are watching him, like a couple of hawks.

1121
01:16:21,566 --> 01:16:24,478
- Gay hawks.
- Yeah, right there, buddy.

1122
01:16:25,935 --> 01:16:26,980
All right, enough bullshit.

1123
01:16:26,981 --> 01:16:30,109
So you know about our poetry boy,
just talk to me. What you got for me?

1124
01:16:30,134 --> 01:16:33,177
- All right, here we go.
- "Here we go."

1125
01:16:33,309 --> 01:16:34,199
Would you please?

1126
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:37,015
Just caused the guy's talking tough,
that don't mean a shit.

1127
01:16:37,222 --> 01:16:38,678
Let me ask you something, Kopernik,

1128
01:16:38,679 --> 01:16:41,599
That gun in his belt...,
What do you think? It's a service pistol?

1129
01:16:41,915 --> 01:16:44,023
I bet you it traces back to Trager,
what do you think about that?

1130
01:16:44,024 --> 01:16:45,067
What do you want to bet?

1131
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:46,412
- Four hundred bucks.
- You are on.

1132
01:16:46,445 --> 01:16:50,613
- I'm in for another five.
- This is fun.

1133
01:16:50,855 --> 01:16:54,294
- Look, I help you, you reciprocate.
- So, help me.

1134
01:16:54,537 --> 01:16:58,785
All right, in my loaded cell phone video,
I got a recording of Trager the night you put him.

1135
01:16:58,795 --> 01:17:01,211
- You got what?
- I got a movie.

1136
01:17:01,413 --> 01:17:03,980
Coupla kids back from the prom,
reserving the special memories,

1137
01:17:03,981 --> 01:17:05,754
postive idea you Big Tom.

1138
01:17:06,066 --> 01:17:07,662
- Oh, yeah, me?
- Yeah.

1139
01:17:09,180 --> 01:17:10,556
Okay.

1140
01:17:10,557 --> 01:17:12,955
- Now you know what I'm talking about.
- Now I got it.

1141
01:17:14,763 --> 01:17:17,433
Yeah, well, so how do I look?

1142
01:17:19,740 --> 01:17:20,776
Like a poet?

1143
01:17:21,403 --> 01:17:25,053
- Because that's who I am, I'm a poet.
- All right, come on, let's go.

1144
01:17:26,334 --> 01:17:29,610
In fact, I've already wrote a poem for you, Spider.
You want to hear it?

1145
01:17:34,627 --> 01:17:37,216
Drop your gun, right now!
Father fucker, drop to ground!

1146
01:17:37,499 --> 01:17:38,834
- Right now!
- Oh, grace me...

1147
01:17:38,834 --> 01:17:42,192
I mean nation will pay you two more or what?

1148
01:17:42,192 --> 01:17:44,862
- Put the fuck weapon on the ground.
- Gladly, gladly, right there.

1149
01:17:44,863 --> 01:17:45,906
Right there.

1150
01:17:49,150 --> 01:17:51,281
- You wanna read my poem?
- Easy, easy.

1151
01:17:51,282 --> 01:17:52,325
There, read it.

1152
01:17:55,541 --> 01:17:59,661
YOU TRIED TO SET ME UP, YOU FUCKS.
AND THIS IS HOW YOU DO IT.

1153
01:17:59,759 --> 01:18:05,372
YOU THOUGHT I GET MY DICK CUT OFF,
INSTEAD YOU WANT TO BLOW IT.

1154
01:18:06,545 --> 01:18:08,689
- Great stuff.        - What is that shit?
- Thank you.

1155
01:18:09,418 --> 01:18:11,642
That is poetry.

1156
01:18:12,168 --> 01:18:14,312
What are you doing here?

1157
01:18:14,514 --> 01:18:18,156
Don't look at me, partner.
But I tagged along to protect your ass...

1158
01:18:18,156 --> 01:18:21,634
...and to see the look in their faces.
It was worth it.

1159
01:18:21,634 --> 01:18:23,981
Hey, we are doing our jobs, okay?
I'm not gonna apologize.

1160
01:18:24,184 --> 01:18:26,499
I don't want you to apologize, Teddy.
There's killer out there with the badge.

1161
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:27,335
What are you muddler doing here?

1162
01:18:27,439 --> 01:18:28,690
- What do you think we are doing here?
- That's a good question.

1163
01:18:28,716 --> 01:18:30,737
- It's not him.
- No, it's not him.

1164
01:18:30,980 --> 01:18:32,117
I just made a thousand bucks.

1165
01:18:32,223 --> 01:18:34,308
Where is the..., where's the other gun?
Come on. Give it to me. I know you got it.

1166
01:18:34,318 --> 01:18:36,026
Don't you frisk me, Sherlock,
go ahead, frisk me.

1167
01:18:36,027 --> 01:18:37,799
- Frisk me, go ahead.
- I don't want to frisk you.

1168
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:38,843
Go ahead.

1169
01:18:42,185 --> 01:18:45,785
Nice touch, Mary.
What are you doing after work?

1170
01:18:45,785 --> 01:18:48,415
Unless you're committed,
I mean I don't wanna get in the middle of anything.

1171
01:18:48,443 --> 01:18:51,999
What happened to your face?
your maid friend gave you a little love bite?

1172
01:18:52,103 --> 01:18:53,836
Shut the fuck up!
Shut your fucking face!

1173
01:18:55,822 --> 01:18:58,246
I will blow your face! You mother fucker.
Get the fuck away!...

1174
01:19:00,499 --> 01:19:01,265
What's he talking about?

1175
01:19:01,475 --> 01:19:04,186
What is he talking about is just 'cause you going for this
does mean you're are not our guy.

1176
01:19:04,293 --> 01:19:05,721
Now we need to break it down.
Come on.

1177
01:19:07,012 --> 01:19:10,903
- Don't let it just going fuck up.
- Okay, he wants to fuck up...

1178
01:19:11,042 --> 01:19:13,433
- Fuck your ass.
- How about through it, man?

1179
01:19:13,642 --> 01:19:16,249
- You made a mistake.
- I'm gonna break this fuck down.

1180
01:19:16,354 --> 01:19:17,814
You fucking dog.

1181
01:19:20,860 --> 01:19:25,148
Relax, Spider.
Come on, let's have a drink for it.

1182
01:19:26,564 --> 01:19:29,841
I saw what I think it's a refrigerator right here.

1183
01:19:33,805 --> 01:19:35,787
I'll be back in a second.

1184
01:19:44,068 --> 01:19:47,074
Hey, pumpkinhead.

1185
01:19:48,976 --> 01:19:50,401
Is this the person who shot you?

1186
01:19:51,549 --> 01:19:52,279
Are you sure?

1187
01:19:58,492 --> 01:20:01,394
No, you pumpkinhead.

1188
01:20:12,733 --> 01:20:14,070
Did you miss me?

1189
01:20:43,693 --> 01:20:47,634
- Take it easy.
- This okay, it's gonna be all right.

1190
01:20:47,634 --> 01:20:51,720
- Jesus Christ, Rooster...
- I just moved into the room. Yeah.

1191
01:20:52,569 --> 01:20:53,725
Sit down.

1192
01:20:53,934 --> 01:20:54,977
Sit down!

1193
01:21:00,579 --> 01:21:03,816
You get to know about this, Tom...,
from me.

1194
01:21:03,816 --> 01:21:07,578
Now, just open that little book.
Start reading.

1195
01:21:07,901 --> 01:21:11,300
Everything you wanna know is in there.

1196
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:12,460
So, read.

1197
01:21:14,547 --> 01:21:15,589
Out loud.

1198
01:21:18,245 --> 01:21:20,025
For the record.

1199
01:21:20,860 --> 01:21:22,111
See little video here.

1200
01:21:29,282 --> 01:21:32,785
My name is David Fisk,  Detective 1st Grade,

1201
01:21:33,097 --> 01:21:36,240
I've been a cop in NYPD for nearly 30 years.

1202
01:21:38,218 --> 01:21:40,919
- But, Dave, Dave,...
- Yeah, what?

1203
01:21:40,993 --> 01:21:42,807
Tom, we got a lot to cover.

1204
01:21:43,225 --> 01:21:45,206
And not much time to do it, so...

1205
01:21:48,348 --> 01:21:50,972
My name is David Fisk,  Detective 1st Grade,

1206
01:21:51,389 --> 01:21:53,594
My name is David Fisk,

1207
01:21:53,698 --> 01:21:56,588
I've been a cop in NYPD for nearly 30 years.

1208
01:21:56,797 --> 01:21:58,778
I don't expect you to remember me.

1209
01:21:59,831 --> 01:22:03,718
I mean it's been a long time,
since you set me on your lap.

1210
01:22:03,891 --> 01:22:05,417
...told me you love me.

1211
01:22:05,731 --> 01:22:06,878
In that time...,

1212
01:22:09,277 --> 01:22:10,529
I've killed fourteen people.

1213
01:22:12,708 --> 01:22:13,796
But I guarantee, ...

1214
01:22:14,110 --> 01:22:15,674
you will remember the name...

1215
01:22:15,988 --> 01:22:17,657
for the rest of your life.

1216
01:22:28,924 --> 01:22:31,877
You don't become a cop
because you want to serve or protect.

1217
01:22:33,091 --> 01:22:36,611
You enjoy the force because they let you
carry the gun and the badge.

1218
01:22:36,611 --> 01:22:40,453
Most people respect the badge,
everybody respects the gun.

1219
01:22:41,182 --> 01:22:44,378
I'm the killer, I show up.
I shot the door.

1220
01:22:44,378 --> 01:22:46,643
What are you talking about?!
This is not a fucking chess game!

1221
01:22:46,643 --> 01:22:50,082
Who knows!? Maybe it is.
You are making all the wrong moves.

1222
01:22:50,446 --> 01:22:53,521
I'll put tools to his fucking head...
myself.

1223
01:22:54,087 --> 01:22:56,433
I know it to a moral certainty.

1224
01:22:56,747 --> 01:22:59,562
Sort of getting numb to it,
sort of getting numb to it...

1225
01:23:08,974 --> 01:23:12,939
Tom Cowan, he was my role model.

1226
01:23:21,798 --> 01:23:25,480
The day I stopped trying to be him,
was the greatest day in my life.

1227
01:23:30,536 --> 01:23:35,027
Several years back, I framed a lowlife
child killer, named Charles Randall.

1228
01:23:38,182 --> 01:23:41,216
I should have known
it will come back to haunt me.

1229
01:23:44,817 --> 01:23:47,972
What,.., what do you want me to do with this?

1230
01:23:48,822 --> 01:23:50,913
Is that all you got to say?

1231
01:23:51,019 --> 01:23:53,730
I owe you this explation, pal.

1232
01:23:54,121 --> 01:23:56,346
Why are you telling me now?

1233
01:23:56,589 --> 01:24:00,086
Ivan The Terrible,
he's gonna wake up pretty soon.

1234
01:24:00,608 --> 01:24:02,173
And he's gonna ID me.

1235
01:24:07,350 --> 01:24:09,923
Evening, Detective, you want one?

1236
01:24:10,237 --> 01:24:12,218
It's a shit, but it's better than nothing, right?

1237
01:24:12,446 --> 01:24:16,007
I can just walk right in here,
your Prosky is asleep. Step outside, come on.

1238
01:24:16,412 --> 01:24:19,729
Did I have a pick the wrong fuck Russian to shoot.

1239
01:24:28,669 --> 01:24:31,703
Now we're going off the record.

1240
01:24:33,806 --> 01:24:38,338
Ah..., I want to take the rap
for the Randall gun think. You saw that.

1241
01:24:39,106 --> 01:24:43,839
I mean considering the circumstance, why not?
No need to thank me.

1242
01:24:46,226 --> 01:24:49,179
- So this is about not being me?
- Yeah.

1243
01:24:50,069 --> 01:24:52,295
I don't get that.

1244
01:24:53,104 --> 01:24:55,539
You are great cop, Tom.

1245
01:24:55,540 --> 01:25:00,963
I mean you are the one I respire to all my life,
it could never be.

1246
01:25:02,734 --> 01:25:04,147
Then you broke the law.

1247
01:25:04,460 --> 01:25:07,166
Planted the gun..., on Randall...,

1248
01:25:08,105 --> 01:25:09,773
...let me down.

1249
01:25:13,169 --> 01:25:15,677
I lost my faith.

1250
01:25:17,255 --> 01:25:19,884
That's when all started.

1251
01:25:20,612 --> 01:25:25,750
And once you did..., I couldn't stop.

1252
01:25:27,085 --> 01:25:32,546
Finally..., I didn't want to.

1253
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:44,197
So, I did my own thing, you know what?
In the end?

1254
01:25:45,128 --> 01:25:50,063
It got done. The scums down.

1255
01:25:50,063 --> 01:25:53,178
Then that's it, that's that.

1256
01:25:53,542 --> 01:25:56,657
I don't understand what you said,

1257
01:25:56,657 --> 01:25:58,477
- don't understand any words...
- I know you don't, Tom.

1258
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:00,783
As soon as I heard the Russian didn't die,

1259
01:26:00,783 --> 01:26:05,597
I knew I had to change the rules,
do something that could never be undone.

1260
01:26:05,597 --> 01:26:08,793
I went for the unforgivable.

1261
01:26:14,982 --> 01:26:19,271
So what am I gonna do?
My friend, partner, arrest you?

1262
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:22,993
Some point I gotta call them in.

1263
01:26:23,235 --> 01:26:25,865
- We are team.
- We were.

1264
01:26:25,866 --> 01:26:27,222
Yeah, we were.

1265
01:26:27,322 --> 01:26:30,193
- Great team.
- That was yesterday, Dave.

1266
01:26:30,436 --> 01:26:32,515
Today, ...

1267
01:26:34,601 --> 01:26:36,686
Today you pointed a gun at me.

1268
01:26:42,290 --> 01:26:44,488
Blasting gone off yet.

1269
01:26:49,692 --> 01:26:52,201
- Bye, Tom.
- Where are you going?

1270
01:26:52,444 --> 01:26:55,963
I don't know, to hell, I suppose.

1271
01:27:43,111 --> 01:27:45,157
Hey, Dave.

1272
01:27:45,471 --> 01:27:47,556
Don't come loser!

1273
01:27:48,046 --> 01:27:50,029
- You wouldn't.
- You want to bet your life on it?

1274
01:27:50,029 --> 01:27:52,375
Come on, partner.
I know you, you wouldn't.

1275
01:27:52,375 --> 01:27:55,166
But I would.

1276
01:27:56,784 --> 01:27:58,116
Karen, just take it easy.

1277
01:27:58,117 --> 01:27:59,785
- Can I get out of your mind.
- Shut up, Dave.

1278
01:27:59,888 --> 01:28:01,553
You..., you're gonna defand this...

1279
01:28:02,075 --> 01:28:03,848
...lowlife piece of shit!?

1280
01:28:03,985 --> 01:28:06,736
- Oh, I am in your head...
- I'm not defanding him.

1281
01:28:06,736 --> 01:28:10,013
- Just take it easy.
- Fuck you, Turk. Put the gun down fast.

1282
01:28:10,256 --> 01:28:11,671
- And if I don't?
- Dave.

1283
01:28:11,881 --> 01:28:15,113
How about I blow your brain down.

1284
01:28:15,291 --> 01:28:16,203
Don't move.

1285
01:28:16,301 --> 01:28:18,381
- Karen.
- You blow me away, Turk dies.

1286
01:28:18,381 --> 01:28:21,098
- Is that your idea?
- I said, don't move, you crap.

1287
01:28:24,820 --> 01:28:26,479
Give me the gun, give me the gun.

1288
01:28:27,813 --> 01:28:30,159
Stay here.

1289
01:28:36,551 --> 01:28:38,183
Oh, man!

1290
01:28:38,914 --> 01:28:39,748
Fuck!

1291
01:28:41,486 --> 01:28:43,429
These old locks.

1292
01:28:43,671 --> 01:28:47,220
- I mean that ain't good.
- Dave, we gotta end this thing.

1293
01:28:47,757 --> 01:28:50,508
- End it?
- Put the gun down.

1294
01:28:51,358 --> 01:28:55,524
What's your plan?
You're gonna arrest me?

1295
01:28:56,467 --> 01:28:59,650
You're gonna take me down to prison,
book me, fingerprint me.

1296
01:29:00,738 --> 01:29:03,530
Body care me, search me?
What the fuck are you going to do?

1297
01:29:03,898 --> 01:29:08,308
Roam me out of Heraldo,
show "Freak" a week? Or better yet...

1298
01:29:08,631 --> 01:29:11,930
"Depth Psychol Profile" on Oprah...,

1299
01:29:12,172 --> 01:29:14,632
Are you ready for that?
I ain't gonna fly, man.

1300
01:29:14,633 --> 01:29:16,301
Dave, you gave me no choice.

1301
01:29:16,561 --> 01:29:19,392
You got a choice, I escape.

1302
01:29:19,635 --> 01:29:22,426
Would you do that for me, Tom?

1303
01:29:23,033 --> 01:29:26,437
- Would you let me escape?
- Come on, don't do this.

1304
01:29:26,513 --> 01:29:30,557
I'm gonna make a run for it.
What do you think?

1305
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:34,037
You gotta do the right thing.

1306
01:29:39,498 --> 01:29:44,757
That's 10-10, partner.
Shots firing. Suspect's fleeing.

1307
01:29:45,202 --> 01:29:47,670
- Let's go!
- Come on, don't go in there.

1308
01:29:48,357 --> 01:29:51,958
Hey, partner, come on!
Shots firing.

1309
01:29:52,201 --> 01:29:56,085
- Don't do this.
- Suspect fleeing. Resisting arrest?

1310
01:29:56,086 --> 01:29:57,129
Come on!

1311
01:30:06,959 --> 01:30:11,497
A RIGHTEOUS MAN..., BEFORE ME STANDS.

1312
01:30:11,949 --> 01:30:15,745
A HERO IN THESE FILTHY LANDS.

1313
01:30:15,988 --> 01:30:22,218
A BROTHER IN ARMS IN HEART ARE YOU.

1314
01:30:22,987 --> 01:30:27,356
I was really hoping you get it too.

1315
01:30:32,444 --> 01:30:33,586
I do get it.

1316
01:30:33,788 --> 01:30:36,539
- No, you don't.
- No, I get it.

1317
01:30:43,228 --> 01:30:45,699
You know the only thing in this life...

1318
01:30:46,117 --> 01:30:48,724
having given me any satisfaction...

1319
01:30:49,458 --> 01:30:51,264
was killing those fucks.

1320
01:30:52,913 --> 01:30:54,621
So this is for real.

1321
01:30:55,866 --> 01:31:00,852
I mean..., this one is bad.

1322
01:31:02,501 --> 01:31:06,191
10-13, officer down.

1323
01:31:30,692 --> 01:31:36,617
I ain't go anywhere, Tom.
Ain't go anywhere.

1324
01:31:37,765 --> 01:31:39,746
It's okay.

1325
01:31:45,417 --> 01:31:48,560
34 squad to central, 34 squad to central.

1326
01:31:48,635 --> 01:31:52,873
10-13, officer down. 184 St. Niklaas
Officer down, 10-13. Hurry, huryy...

1327
01:31:53,382 --> 01:31:56,832
- 10-4, confirm called, 184 St. Niklaas, officer down.
- Tom, don't.

1328
01:31:56,906 --> 01:31:59,514
ETA six minutes.

1329
01:31:59,724 --> 01:32:01,601
Don't,...

1330
01:32:14,636 --> 01:32:16,200
Don't...

1331
01:32:25,143 --> 01:32:29,306
- 34 squad to central.
- Central, go ahead, 34 squad.

1332
01:32:29,592 --> 01:32:33,477
- It's a 10-55, cancle the ambulance.
- 10-5?

1333
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:37,400
Cancle the ambulance,
10-55, cancle the ambulance.

1334
01:32:37,643 --> 01:32:40,475
- Are you sure on that?
- Sure on that.

1335
01:32:49,335 --> 01:32:57,102
- You did this show.
- I know, partner. I know.

1336
01:32:59,894 --> 01:33:02,887
We did good, Tom.

1337
01:33:03,210 --> 01:33:04,020
Tom.

1338
01:33:04,542 --> 01:33:05,689
Tell me.

1339
01:33:05,794 --> 01:33:08,818
We did good, we did good.

1340
01:33:10,007 --> 01:33:12,662
You're a good man, Tom.

1341
01:33:14,957 --> 01:33:17,042
You're a good man.

1342
01:33:17,248 --> 01:33:18,573
I wish you...

1343
01:33:20,659 --> 01:33:23,057
I wish you...

1344
01:33:23,476 --> 01:33:26,187
magnificant successful.

1345
01:34:07,938 --> 01:34:11,052
- Some piece of work, your partner.
- Ligths.

1346
01:34:12,225 --> 01:34:19,710
Look, Cowan, as we see it,
Detective Fisk just closed the door on the poetry boy.

1347
01:34:25,859 --> 01:34:28,973
Good, whatever...,
whatever you say.

1348
01:34:32,412 --> 01:34:37,874
- Have we done?
- Yeah, we done.

1349
01:34:58,748 --> 01:35:03,926
My daughter called, she was upset about Rooster,
and worried about me.

1350
01:35:05,058 --> 01:35:08,659
She asked me if I was like him
to do something stupid.

1351
01:35:08,902 --> 01:35:10,866
Then I said, "like what?".

1352
01:35:10,972 --> 01:35:13,683
Take anger management classes? Or retire?

1353
01:35:13,959 --> 01:35:17,155
I said I was gonna
do the same old thing I always do.

1354
01:35:17,155 --> 01:35:20,633
She said "good", whatelse could you do.

1355
01:35:20,633 --> 01:35:25,367
I said
"right, a real chip off the old block, my daughter".

1356
01:35:25,367 --> 01:35:28,684
She said that I was a cop, and a good one.

1357
01:35:28,968 --> 01:35:33,539
Funny, Rooster said the same thing.

1358
01:35:35,642 --> 01:35:38,986
Hey, guys, let's really play ball.

1359
01:35:39,196 --> 01:35:40,134
Count to three...

1360
01:35:41,386 --> 01:35:42,950
Everyone in?

1361
01:35:43,088 --> 01:35:45,671
One, two, three.
Yes!
