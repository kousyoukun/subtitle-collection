1
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:28,580
遠古以前，一個遙遠的星系...

2
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,020
銀河參議會掀起一場騷動

3
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,090
數千個星系紛紛表達...

4
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:01,160
退出共和國的意圖

5
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,830
分離主義運動...

6
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:07,900
在神秘的杜酷伯爵帶領下...

7
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,970
逐漸脫離絕地武士的掌握

8
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,030
銀河的和平秩序面臨失控

9
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,510
艾米達拉參議員，前那卜女王

10
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:22,580
正趕往銀河參議會

11
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,650
為重大議案投下一票

12
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,720
決定是否建立共和軍

13
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:31,790
協助寡不敵眾的絕地武士

14
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,560
參議員，我們即將抵達科羅森
Senator, we're making our final approach into Coruscant.

15
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,100
很好，隊長
Very good, Lieutenant.

16
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,320
成功安全抵達
We made it.

17
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,460
看來是我錯了
I guess I was wrong.

18
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,260
似乎根本沒有危險
There was no danger at all.

19
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,270
柯笛...
Corde.

20
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,580
殿下...很抱歉
Milady, I'm so sorry.

21
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,310
我未能完成使命，參議員
I've failed you, Senator.

22
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:51,820
不
No.

23
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,560
殿下，此處尚有危險
Milady, you're still in danger here.

24
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,430
我根本不該回來
- I shouldn't have come back. - This vote is very important.

25
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:11,200
這次投票很重要，你盡忠職守 柯笛鞠躬盡瘁了，走吧
You did your duty. Corde did hers. Now, come.

26
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:15,040
艾米達拉議員，請
Senator Amidala, please.

27
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:30,460
我沒把握投票還能拖延多久
I don't know how much longer I can hold off the vote, my friends.

28
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:33,630
越來越多星系投入分離主義
More and more star systems are joining the separatists.

29
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,860
一旦他們脫離...
If they do break away--

30
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,130
我不會坐視共和國...
I will not let this Republic that has stood for a thousand years...

31
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,970
屹立千年之後竟一分為二
be split in two.

32
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:44,140
我的協商不會破裂
My negotiations will not fail.

33
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,440
萬一協商不成，你瞭解...
If they do, you must realize...

34
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,880
絕地武士不足以保護共和國
there aren't enough Jedi to protect the Republic.

35
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,520
我們是和平保護者，不是軍人
We're keepers of the peace, not soldiers.

36
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,820
尤達大師...
Master Yoda...

37
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,220
你認為真的會有戰爭嗎？
do you think it will really come to war?

38
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,730
黑暗勢力無孔不入
The dark side clouds everything.

39
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:10,200
無法看清未來之事
Impossible to see the future is.

40
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:15,200
皇家委員已抵達，閣下
The Loyalist Committee has arrived, Your Honor.

41
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,330
很好
Good.

42
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,180
請他們進來
Send them in.

43
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,880
此事稍後再討論
We will discuss this matter later.

44
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,020
艾米達拉參議員...
Senator Amidala, your tragedy on the landing platform--

45
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,130
登陸台上的悲劇讓人遺憾
terrible.

46
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,000
你的平安讓我十分寬心
Seeing you alive brings warm feelings to my heart.

47
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,820
你們知不知道是誰指使的？
Do you have any idea who was behind this attack?

48
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,430
我們的情報顯示是...
Our intelligence points to disgruntled

49
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,440
那卜星不滿的香料礦工所為
spice miners on the moons of Naboo.

50
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:48,470
我認為是杜酷伯爵策動的
I think that Count Dooku was behind it.

51
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:52,470
他是政治理想家，不是殺人魔
He is a political idealist, not a murderer.

52
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:55,550
殿下，杜酷伯爵曾是絕地武士
You know, milady, Count Dooku was once a Jedi.

53
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,240
他不可能從事暗殺
He couldn't assassinate anyone.

54
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,150
他的人格不允許他這麼做
It's not in his character.

55
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,810
確定的是，參議員...
But for certain, Senator...

56
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,820
你的處境極為危險
in grave danger you are.

57
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:10,660
絕地大師，容我建議安排...
MasterJedi, may I suggest...

58
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:14,060
參議員接受你們的保護
the senator be placed under the protection of your graces?

59
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,370
明智嗎？時局如此緊張之際
Do you really think that's a wise decision under these stressful times?

60
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,060
議長閣下，我不相信...
Chancellor, if I may comment, I do not believe--

61
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,400
...時局...真有如此嚴重
The situation is that serious?

62
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,430
不，但我認為，參議員...
No, but I do, Senator.

63
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:27,910
我瞭解額外的保全...
I realize all too well that additional security...

64
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:31,490
會對你造成困擾，但...
might be disruptive for you...

65
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:34,410
或許我能指派個熟人...
but perhaps someone you're familiar with.

66
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,420
老朋友，比如說肯諾比大師
An old friend, like Master Kenobi.

67
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,660
頗為可行
That's possible.

68
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,660
他剛調解完昂遜星的疆界糾紛
He's just returned from a border dispute on Ansion.

69
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,960
請給我個面子，殿下
Do it for me, milady. Please?

70
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,470
萬一失去你
The thought of losing you...

71
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,040
我將無法忍受
is unbearable.

72
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:56,780
我請歐比王立刻向你報到
I will have Obi-Wan report to you immediately, milady.

73
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,210
謝謝你，雲杜大師
Thank you, Master Windu.

74
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,520
你好像很緊張
- You seem a little on edge.

75
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,480
一點也不
- Not at all.

76
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,190
從誤陷鋼韃巢穴後...
I haven't felt you this tense since

77
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,890
沒看過你這麼緊張
we fell into that nest of gundarks.

78
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,930
是你深陷險境，師父
You fell into that nightmare, Master...

79
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:21,520
我救了你，記得嗎？
and I rescued you, remember?

80
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,970
對啦
Oh... yes.

81
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:33,610
你在冒汗，放輕鬆，深呼吸
You're sweating. Relax. Take a deep breath.

82
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,810
跟她已經十年不見了
I haven't seen her in ten years, Master.

83
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,370
歐比？歐比！好高興見到你！
Obi? Obi!- Mesa so smilen to seein yousa!

84
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:58,030
很高興又見面，恰恰
- Good to see you again,JarJar.

85
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,500
帕米參議員！
Senator Padme.

86
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:03,810
我朋友來了，你看，參議員
Mesa palos here! Lookie, lookie, Senator.

87
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,050
絕地武士到了
Desa Jedi arriven.

88
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,850
很榮幸再見面，殿下
It's a great pleasure to see you again, milady.

89
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,820
時光飛逝啊，肯諾比大師
It has been far too long, Master Kenobi.

90
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:18,580
安納？
Ani?

91
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:20,590
天啊，你長大了
- My goodness, you've grown.

92
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,030
你也是啊
- So have you.

93
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,530
我是說，你更漂亮了
Grown more beautiful, I mean.

94
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:27,330
以參議員的標準來說
Well, for a senator, I mean.

95
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,830
對我你永遠是塔圖印的小男孩
Ani, you'll always be that little boy I knew on Tatooine.

96
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:37,740
我承諾你不會感到我們的存在
Our presence here will be invisible, milady, I can assure you.

97
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,280
泰佛隊長，陛下的護衛
I'm Captain Typho of Her Majesty's security service.

98
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,610
亞蜜莉雅女王已得知這項指派
Queen Jamillia has been informed of your assignment.

99
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,780
很高興你能來
I am grateful you are here, Master Kenobi.

100
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:47,720
局勢比參議員所知的更險惡
The situation is more dangerous than the senator will admit.

101
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,550
我需要答案，不是加強警戒
I don't need more security. I need answers.

102
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,880
我要知道誰想殺我
I want to know who's trying to kill me.

103
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:56,790
我們是來保護你，不是來調查
We are here to protect you, Senator, not to start an investigation.

104
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:01,040
我們會查出誰想殺你，帕米...
We will find out who's trying to kill you, Padme. I promise you.

105
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,100
我們不會逾越職權，小徒弟
We will not exceed our mandate, my young Padawan learner.

106
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,110
我只是說盡力保護她，師父
I meant that in the interest of protecting her, Master, of course.

107
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,770
別再跟我爭辯，安納金
We will not go through this exercise again, Anakin...

108
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,940
多聽從我的教誨
and you will pay attention to my lead.

109
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:12,670
為什麼？
- Why?

110
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,050
什麼？
- What?

111
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,580
派我們來為什麼不調查兇手？
Why else do you think we were assigned to her if not to find the killer?

112
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,450
保護工作是本地警方的任務
Protection is a job

113
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,720
派絕地武士等於殺雞用牛刀
for local security, notJedi.

114
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,920
所以調查權隱含在我們職權內
It's overkill, Master. Investigation is implied in our mandate.

115
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:29,290
我們遵守議長的指示就是了
We will do exactly as the council has instructed.

116
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:34,800
學著恪遵本分，年輕人
And you will learn your place, young one.

117
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:43,410
你們的出現就顯得事有蹊蹺了
Perhaps with merely your presence... the mystery surrounding this threat will be revealed.

118
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:48,040
若不介意...容我告退
Now, if you'll excuse me... I will retire.

119
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,520
你們留在這裏讓我放心多了
I know I'll feel better having you here.

120
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,140
我會在每層樓都派駐軍官
I'll have an officer stationed on every floor...

121
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,250
我本人在樓下指揮中心
and I'll be in the control center downstairs.

122
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:00,620
真高興又見面了，安納
Mesa busten wit happiness seein yousa again, Ani.

123
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,500
她幾乎不認識我了，恰恰
She hardly even recognized me,JarJar.

124
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,490
她走後我天天思念她
I've thought about her every day since we parted and...

125
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,660
她卻把我忘得一乾二淨
she's forgotten me completely.

126
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:16,010
她很快樂，比以前還快樂
Shesa happy. Happier den mesa seein her in a longo time.

127
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:19,840
你盡往壞處想，當心你的思想
You're focusing on the negative, Anakin. Be mindful of your thoughts.

128
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,580
剛見面時她十分開心
She was pleased to see us.

129
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,710
去檢查一下安全措施
Now, let's check the security.

130
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,890
擊中了太空船，但他們用替身
I hit the ship, but they used a decoy.

131
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,290
要用更巧妙的手段，嬋姆
We'll have to try something more subtle this time, Zam.

132
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,370
我的客戶快失去耐性了
My client is getting impatient.

133
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,330
拿去，小心有毒
Take these. Be careful. They're very poisonous.

134
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,060
嬋姆，這次不能再出錯了
And, Zam, there can be no mistakes this time.

135
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:52,480
泰佛隊長派很多人駐紮樓下
Captain Typho has more than enough men downstairs.

136
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,010
刺客不會從那裏進來
No assassin would try that way.

137
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,450
上面有動靜嗎？
- Any activity up here?

138
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,180
一片死寂
- Quiet as a tomb.

139
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:02,410
我不喜歡枯等
I don't like just waiting here for something to happen to her.

140
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,720
怎麼回事？
- What's going on? - She covered the cameras.

141
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:08,630
攝影機遮住了，她不想讓我看
I don't think she liked me watching her.

142
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,360
她心裏在想什麼？
What is she thinking?

143
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:13,400
有入侵者R2會警告我們
She programmed R2 to warn us if there is an intruder.

144
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,390
刺殺參議員的方法不僅只如此
There are many other ways to kill a senator.

145
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:20,860
我知道，我們也想抓刺客吧？
I know, but we also want to catch this assassin, don't we, Master?

146
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,810
你把她當成餌？
You're using her as bait.

147
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:26,940
那是她的主意
It was her idea.

148
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,850
別擔心，她不會受到任何傷害
Don't worry. No harm will come to her.

149
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:33,280
我可以感覺她房內的一舉一動
I can sense everything going on in that room.

150
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,720
相信我
Trust me.

151
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,720
風險太高
It's too risky.

152
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:41,350
再說，你的感覺還不夠協調
Besides, your senses aren't that attuned, my young apprentice.

153
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,990
你的就夠協調？
And yours are?

154
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,130
可以這麼說
Possibly.

155
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,110
你很累了
You look tired.

156
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,610
我再也睡不安穩
I don't sleep well anymore.

157
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,850
因為你的母親？
Because of your mother?

158
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:16,660
不曉得為什麼一直夢見她
I don't know why I keep dreaming about her.

159
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,100
夢境隨時間消逝
Dreams pass in time.

160
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
我寧可夢見帕米
I'd much rather dream about Padme.

161
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:30,240
待在她身邊就令人臉紅心跳
Just being around her again is... intoxicating.

162
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,070
當心你的思緒，它會背叛你
Be mindful of your thoughts, Anakin. They betray you.

163
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:37,480
你承諾過要信守絕地武士誡律
You've made a commitment to theJedi order... a commitment not easily broken.

164
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,350
她是政治人物，不值得信賴
And don't forget, she's a politician. They're not to be trusted.

165
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:42,890
她跟其他議員不一樣
She's not like the others in the senate, Master.

166
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,980
根據我的經驗，議員們...
It is my experience that senators focus...

167
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:48,790
只討好贊助自己政治主張的人
only on pleasing those who fund their campaigns...

168
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:53,300
為獲得贊助往往不顧民主真義
and they're in no means scared of forgetting the niceties of democracy...

169
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,920
不要再說教了
- in order to get those funds. - Not another lecture.

170
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:57,900
至少不要談政客的黑金問題
At least not on the economics of politics.

171
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:56,390
而且你是以偏概全
And besides, you're generalizing.

172
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,520
議長不像個貪官感吏
The chancellor doesn't appear to be corrupt.

173
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,120
白卜庭是個政客
Palpatine is a politician.

174
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,670
他是個聰明人
I have observed that he is very clever...

175
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:06,070
深諳投各議員所好的巧妙手腕
in following the passions and the prejudices of the senators.

176
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,970
我認為他是個好人，師...
I think he's a good man--

177
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:10,940
我也感覺到了
I sense it too.

178
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,320
留在這裏！
Stay here!

179
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,460
您沒事吧？
Are you all right, milady?

180
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,170
搞什麼？
What the--

181
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:23,500
怎麼這麼慢？
- What took you so long? - Oh, you know, Master.

182
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:27,610
找不到中意的飛艇... 他在那裏
- I couldn't find a speeder I liked... - There he is.

183
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,050
...要敞蓬座艙，速度又要快
with the open cockpit and the right speed capabilities.

184
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,310
你要是多練光劍少練嘴皮子
If you spent as long practicing your saber techniques as you do your wit...

185
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,290
劍術大概可以直逼尤達大師了
you would rival Master Yoda as a swordsman.

186
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,580
我已經跟他不相上下了
I thought I already did.

187
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:40,420
別一廂情願，小徒弟
Only in your mind, my very young apprentice.

188
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:11,360
拉起來，安納金，拉起來！
Pull up, Anakin. Pull up!

189
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:20,400
我不喜歡你亂耍花招
You know I don't like it when you do that.

190
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,940
抱歉師父，忘了你不喜歡飛行
Sorry, Master. I forgot you don't like flying.

191
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,870
飛行還好，你剛剛是自殺！
I don't mind flying, but what you're doing is suicide!

192
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:58,130
跟你說過多少次...
Anakin! How many times have I told you...

193
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,470
不要穿越電藕火花
stay away from power couplings!

194
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,470
得到教訓了吧
That was good!

195
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,490
你要去哪？他往那邊去了！
Where are you going? He went that way.

196
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,860
繼續追下去，那怪胎會被燒焦
Master, if we keep this chase going any longer... that creep is gonna end up deep-fried...

197
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:31,130
我想查出他是誰？誰派來的？
and, personally, I'd like to find out who he is and who he's working for.

198
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,930
這是捷徑...我認為
This is a shortcut... I think.

199
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:03,070
好啦，跟丟了
Well, you've lost him.

200
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,100
非常抱歉，師父
I'm deeply sorry, Master.

201
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:10,280
好個捷徑，他根本往另一邊走
That was some shortcut, Anakin. He went completely the other way.

202
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,240
再一次證明你...
- Once again you've proved--

203
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,900
失陪一下
- If you'll excuse me.

204
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,140
可惡，他又來這套
I hate it when he does that.

205
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,070
安納金！
Anakin!

206
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,530
她逃進俱樂部裏了，師父
- She went into the club, Master. - Patience.

207
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,840
耐心，使用原力，思考
- Use the Force. Think.

208
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:54,800
對不起，師父
- Sorry, Master.

209
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,840
他是躲進去，不是從那逃走
- He went in there to hide, not to run.

210
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,240
是的，師父
- Yes, Master.

211
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,350
下次不要亂丟
- Next time, try not to lose it.

212
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:01,210
是的，師父
- Yes, Master.

213
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:02,840
這武器是你的生命
- This weapon is your life.

214
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,080
我盡量記住，師父
- I try, Master.

215
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,980
老感覺總有一天我會被你害死
Why do I get the feeling you're going to be the death of me?

216
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:12,020
別這麼說，我把你當成父親
Don't say that, Master. You're the closest thing I have to a father.

217
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,550
那你怎麼老是不聽話？
Then why don't you listen to me?

218
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,320
我正在努力
I am trying.

219
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,770
看到他了嗎？
Can you see him?

220
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,710
我認為他是個女的
I think he is a she...

221
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,580
而且她會變身
and I think she is a changeling.

222
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,340
這麼說，要格外小心
In that case, be extra careful.

223
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:40,710
去找她
- Go and find her.

224
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,250
你要去哪裏？
- Where are you going, Master?

225
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,850
喝一杯
For a drink.

226
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:55,600
謝謝
Thank you.

227
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,960
要不要買點銷魂棒？
-You wanna buy some death sticks?

228
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:00,540
不要向我兜售銷魂棒
-You don't want to sell me death sticks.

229
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,340
我不向你兜售銷魂棒
I don't want to sell you death sticks.

230
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,740
回家思考生命的意義
You want to go home and rethink your life.

231
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,180
我要回家思考生命的意義
I want to go home and rethink my life.

232
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,380
沒事
Easy.

233
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,190
絕地武士任務，繼續喝
Jedi business. Go back to your drinks.

234
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:07,770
你知道你刺殺的是誰嗎？
Do you know who it was you were trying to kill?

235
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:10,340
那卜星的參議員
It was a senator from Naboo.

236
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,970
誰雇你的？
- And who hired you?

237
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,140
只不過是出趟任務
- It was just a job.

238
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,710
誰雇你的？說
Who hired you? Tell us.

239
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,220
快說！
Tell us now!

240
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,020
一位賞金獵人，叫...
It was a bounty hunter called--

241
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,640
毒鏢
Toxic dart.

242
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:58,690
查出這個賞金獵人，歐比王
Track down this bounty hunter you must, Obi-Wan.

243
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:02,220
更重要的是查出誰在主使
Most importantly, find out who he's working for.

244
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:06,230
艾米達拉議員還需要保護嗎？
What about Senator Amidala? She will still need protecting.

245
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,790
你徒弟會去執行
Handle that your Padawan will.

246
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,670
安納金，保護參議員回那卜星
Anakin, escort the senator back to her home planet of Naboo.

247
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:16,240
她在那兒比較安全
She'll be safer there. And don't use registered transport.

248
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:20,640
別搭乘公共運輸，喬裝成難民
Travel as refugees.

249
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:22,280
身為反對陣營領袖
As the leader of the opposition, it will be very difficult...

250
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:26,120
她不太容易離開首都
to get Senator Amidala to leave the capital.

251
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:29,620
逮到殺手前...
Until caught this killer is...

252
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:33,320
她必須遵守我們的裁定
our judgment she must respect.

253
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:35,590
安納金，到參議院去
Anakin, go to the senate...

254
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:38,760
要求白卜庭議長找她談談
and ask Chancellor Palpatine to speak with her about this matter.

255
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:50,230
我跟她溝通，艾米達拉議員...
I will talk with her.

256
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,810
不會違抗我的命令
Senator Amidala will not refuse an executive order.

257
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:55,210
我跟她很熟，不會有問題
I know her well enough to assure you of that.

258
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,380
謝謝您，閣下
Thank you, Your Excellency.

259
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:01,320
他們終於派任務給你了
And so, they've finally given you an assignment.

260
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:03,980
你的耐心有了代價
Your patience has paid off.

261
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,450
你的指導功用更勝於我的耐心
Your guidance more than my patience.

262
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:10,360
你不需要人指導，安納金
You don't need guidance, Anakin.

263
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,500
你很快將學會相信自己的感覺
In time, you will learn to trust your feelings.

264
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:18,330
然後你就所向無敵了
Then you will be invincible.

265
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,500
我說過很多次
I have said it many times:

266
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:26,440
你是最有天賦的絕地武士
You are the most gifted Jedi I have ever met.

267
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:28,040
多謝褒獎，閣下
Thank you, Your Excellency.

268
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:31,950
你會成為最偉大的絕地武士
I see you becoming the greatest of all theJedi, Anakin...

269
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:35,320
力量更勝於尤達大師
even more powerful than Master Yoda.

270
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:41,680
我很替我徒弟擔心
I am concerned for my Padawan.

271
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,560
他還不適合接派任務
He is not ready to be given this assignment on his own yet.

272
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:47,930
議會對其決定有信心
The council is confident in its decision, Obi-Wan.

273
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,900
那男孩有過人的才能
The boy has exceptional skills.

274
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,490
但他還有很多要學
But he still has much to learn, Master.

275
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:56,040
他的能力使得他...傲慢自大
His abilities have made him, well, arrogant.

276
00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:01,350
對，絕地武士日益普遍的缺點
Yes. A flaw more and more common among Jedi.

277
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,710
太自以為是
Too sure of themselves they are.

278
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:09,350
甚至老一輩有經驗的也一樣
Even the older, more experienced ones.

279
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:13,120
記住，歐比王，若預言成真...
Remember, Obi-Wan, if the prophecy is true...

280
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:16,680
只有安納金能讓原力重歸和諧
your apprentice is the only one who can bring the Force back into balance.

281
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:23,630
我要請一段長假
I'm taking an extended leave of absence.

282
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:26,930
你得在參議院代理我的職務
It will be your responsibility to take my place in the senate.

283
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:29,940
冰克斯代表...全靠你啦
Representative Binks, I know I can count on you.

284
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,810
很榮幸擔此重任
Mesa honored to be taking on dissa heavy burden.

285
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:39,210
我十分謙虛的接受任務
Mesa accept this with muy, muy humility and--

286
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:42,320
恰恰，我不耽擱你的時間
JarJar, I don't wish to hold you up.

287
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,980
你還有很多工作要做
I'm sure you have a great deal to do.

288
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:47,780
那當然...殿下
Of course. Milady.

289
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:54,230
我不喜歡躲躲藏藏
I do not like this idea of hiding.

290
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,440
別擔心，議會已下令調查
Don't worry. Now that the council has ordered an investigation...

291
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,170
歐比王大師會找出那賞金獵人
it won't take Master Obi-Wan long to find this bounty hunter.

292
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:04,300
我努力一整年對抗建軍案
I haven't worked for a year to defeat the Military Creation Act...

293
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:06,670
事到臨頭竟無法投票
to not be here when its fate is decided.

294
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:10,920
有時得將自尊擺一邊聽命行事
Sometimes we must let go of our pride... and do what is requested of us.

295
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:14,510
安納金...你成熟多了
Anakin, you've grown up.

296
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,450
歐比王卻極力視而不見
Master Obi-Wan manages not to see it.

297
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:29,870
別誤會，歐比王是個好老師
Don't get me wrong. Obi-Wan is a great mentor.

298
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,400
他智慧可比尤達大師
As wise as Master Yoda and...

299
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,870
力量不輸雲杜大師
as powerful as Master Windu.

300
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:39,480
我很感激他收我為徒
I am truly thankful to be his apprentice.

301
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:45,310
但在某些方面...許多方面...
In some ways-- a lot of ways--

302
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,350
我已經青出於藍
I'm really ahead of him.

303
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,290
我已經準備好接受試驗
I'm ready for the trials...

304
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,990
但他覺得我難以捉摸
but he feels that I'm too unpredictable.

305
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:56,860
不讓我更上一層樓
He won't let me move on.

306
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,860
你一定感到很挫折 比挫折還糟！
- That must be frustrating. - It's worse.

307
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:02,530
他百般挑剔，從不聽我說
He's overly critical. He never listens.

308
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,600
他不瞭解我，這不公平！
He doesn't understand. It's not fair!

309
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:12,640
師父比我們更容易看清缺點
All mentors have a way of seeing more of our faults than we would like.

310
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,580
我們就是這樣成長的
It's the only way we grow.

311
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,880
我瞭解
I know.

312
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:26,050
安納金...不要急著長大
Anakin... don't try to grow up too fast.

313
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:28,120
但我已經長大了
But I am grown up.

314
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,960
你自己也這麼說過
You said it yourself.

315
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,400
不要這樣看我
Please don't look at me like that.

316
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:37,860
為什麼？
Why not?

317
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,100
看得我渾身不自在
It makes me feel uncomfortable.

318
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,810
對不起，殿下
Sorry, milady.

319
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:00,820
保重，殿下
- Be safe, milady.

320
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:02,260
謝謝你，隊長
- Thank you, Captain.

321
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,300
多照顧朵美，威脅轉向你們了
Take good care of Dorme. The threat's on you two now.

322
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:07,320
他跟我在一起很安全
He'll be safe with me.

323
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,460
你不會有事的
You'll be fine.

324
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:17,040
問題不在我，我擔心的是你
It's not me, milady. I worry about you.

325
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:19,200
萬一他們知道你離開首都呢？
What if they realize you've left the capital?

326
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:23,650
我的保護者就得秀出真本事了
Well, then myJedi protector will have to prove how good he is.

327
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,380
安納金，採取任何行動前...
Anakin...

328
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:28,890
先詢問我或議會的意見
don't do anything without first consulting either myself or the council.

329
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,720
是的，師父
Yes, Master.

330
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:34,860
我會查清楚這項陰謀
I'll get to the bottom of this plot quickly, milady.

331
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,660
你很快就可以再回來
You'll be back here in no time.

332
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,530
非常感謝你迅速查案
I'll be most grateful for your speed, MasterJedi.

333
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,060
該走了
- It's time to go.

334
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:41,960
我知道
- I know.

335
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:44,870
安納金，願原力與你同在
Anakin, may the Force be with you.

336
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:46,940
願原力與你同在，師父
May the Force be with you, Master.

337
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,880
我突然感到害怕
Suddenly I'm afraid.

338
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:02,350
這是我第一次單獨出任務
This is my first assignment on my own.

339
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,850
我也會害怕
I am too.

340
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:08,630
不用擔心，有R2在
Don't worry. We have R2 with us.

341
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,040
我希望他不會輕舉妄動
I do hope he doesn't try anything foolish.

342
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:21,130
我反而比較擔心她會輕舉妄動
I'd be more concerned about her doing something than him.

343
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:44,290
親愛的，有人來找你
Someone to see ya, honey!

344
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,420
看起來是個絕地武士
Jedi, by the looks of him.

345
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:49,030
歐比王！
Obi-Wan!

346
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:51,430
哈羅，德克斯
Hello, Dex.

347
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:54,130
坐一下，我馬上過來
Take a seat. I'll be right with ya.

348
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,010
來一杯夾哇果汁吧
- You wanna cup o'jawa juice?

349
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,850
好啊，謝謝
- Oh, yes. Thank you.

350
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,110
嘿...老哥！
Old buddy!

351
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,830
老朋友，我能幫什麼忙？
So, my friend, what can I do for ya?

352
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:20,630
這是什麼東西？
You can tell me what this is.

353
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:25,510
很久沒見到這玩意，自從...
Well, whattaya know!

354
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,970
在外星系外的薩特羅採礦之後
I ain't seen one of these since I was prospectin'...

355
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:31,540
在外星系外的薩特羅採礦之後
on Subterrel, beyond the outer rim.

356
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,610
它從哪裏來的？
Can you tell me where it came from?

357
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:36,810
這是複製人的東西
This baby belongs to them cloners.

358
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:41,220
這支是卡密諾星的劍鏢
What you got here is a Kamino saberdart.

359
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:44,320
檔案資料庫裏沒有這東西
I wonder why it didn't show up in the analysis archives.

360
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:47,560
看鏢身的特殊切割就知道
It's these funny little cuts on the side that give it away.

361
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:51,460
「分析機器人」只會看標誌
Those analysis droids only focus on symbols.

362
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,730
你們絕地武士應該多注重...
I should think that you Jedi would have more respect...

363
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:59,430
知識與智慧的區別
for the difference between knowledge and... wisdom.

364
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:03,700
機器人會思考，我們還混什麼
Well, if droids could think... there'd be none of us here, would there?

365
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,610
我不瞭解卡密諾星
Kamino. I'm not familiar with it.

366
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:06,800
它是共和國的一員嗎？
Is it in the Republic?

367
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:08,640
不，它在外星系之外
No, no. It's beyond the outer rim.

368
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:14,140
在厘希邁司外約12秒差的距離
I'd say about 1 2 parsecs outside the Rishi Maze.

369
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:18,350
連資料庫機器人都不難找到它
Should be easy to find, even for those droids in your archives.

370
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:24,560
卡密諾人...離群索居
These Kaminoans keep to themselves.

371
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:27,720
他們是複製人，非常優異
They're cloners. Damn good ones too.

372
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:30,330
這些複製人友善嗎？
- Cloners. Are they friendly?

373
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,670
視情況而定
- Depends.

374
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:34,300
視什麼情況，德克斯？
Depends on what, Dex?

375
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:37,210
視你的態度以及...
On how good your manners are...

376
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:42,410
你口袋裏的鈔票而定
and how big your... pocketbook is.

377
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,920
是你要求協助的嗎？
- Did you call for assistance?

378
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:55,120
是的
- Yes, I did.

379
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,400
有問題嗎，肯諾比大師？
Are you having a problem, Master Kenobi?

380
00:33:57,530 --> 00:34:00,930
我想找卡密諾行星系統... 卡密諾？
Yes, I'm looking for a planetary system called Kamino.

381
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,930
但不在檔案圖庫裏面
It doesn't show up on the archive charts.

382
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:07,400
我對卡密諾星系不熟
Kamino. It's not a system I'm familiar with.

383
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:10,030
你座標沒弄錯吧？
Are you sure you have the right coordinates?

384
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:13,010
根據資料，應該在這個象限里
According to my information, it should appear in this quadrant here...

385
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:15,010
緊臨厘希邁司南邊
just south of the Rishi Maze.

386
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:27,230
你尋找的星系似乎不存在
I hate to say it, but it looks like the system you're searching for... doesn't exist.

387
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:30,560
不可能，除非檔案資料不完整
Impossible. Perhaps the archives are incomplete.

388
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:36,560
檔案裏沒有就一定不存在
If an item does not appear in our records... it does not exist.

389
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,660
你！不招待機器人，出去！
Hey, you! No droids! Get outta here!

390
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:10,860
謝謝你，R2
Thank you, R2.

391
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,870
絕地武士的生活一定相當清苦
Must be difficult, having sworn your life to theJedi...

392
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:19,070
行動、行事都受到限制
not being able to visit the places you like or do the things you like.

393
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:21,240
也不能跟所愛的人在一起
Or be with the people that I love.

394
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,150
你可以愛人嗎？
Are you allowed to love?

395
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:26,180
我以為絕地武士是不准動情的
I thought that was forbidden for a Jedi.

396
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,550
不得愛戀
Attachment is forbidden.

397
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,490
不得擁有
Possession is forbidden.

398
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:39,400
慈悲心...我定義成無私的愛...
Compassion, which I would define as unconditional love...

399
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,930
是絕地武士的中心思想
is central to a Jedi's life.

400
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:48,300
所以可以解釋為...「愛心廣被」
So you might say that we are encouraged to love.

401
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:50,570
你變好多
You've changed so much.

402
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,740
你一點都沒變
You haven't changed a bit.

403
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:56,340
跟我夢中的你一模一樣
You're exactly the way I remember you in my dreams.

404
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:12,850
探索，感受週遭的原力
Reach out. Sense the Force around you.

405
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,200
一定要運用你的感覺
Use your feelings you must.

406
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:23,030
年輕人！年輕人！
Younglings. Younglings!

407
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,440
有客人來訪
A visitor we have.

408
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,610
哈羅，歐比王大師
Hello, Master Obi-Wan.

409
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,840
抱歉打擾，大師
Hello. I'm sorry to disturb you, Master.

410
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:35,580
有何指教，歐比王？
What help can I be, Obi-Wan?

411
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,590
我在找一個老朋友介紹的行星
I'm looking for a planet described to me by an old friend.

412
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:41,820
但該星系不在檔案地圖裏
I trust him, but the systems don't show on the archive maps.

413
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:46,430
歐比王找不到一顆行星，真糗
Lost a planet Master Obi-Wan has.

414
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:53,830
真糗啊！連恩，拉上窗簾
How embarrassing! Liam, the shades.

415
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,370
圍在地圖儀四周
Gather round the map reader.

416
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,600
清理你們的思緒
Clear your minds...

417
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:03,380
我們就會找到歐比王要的行星
and find Obi-Wan's wayward planet we will.

418
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:09,590
它應該在...這裏，但卻找不到
It ought to be here... but it isn't.

419
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:13,350
這區的重力將星球都吸往這點
Gravity is pulling all the stars in the area towards this spot.

420
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:20,100
重力作用存在，但所有星體...
Gravity's silhouette remains... but the star and all the planets...

421
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,070
卻消失無蹤
disappeared they have.

422
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:27,370
怎麼會這樣？想想看？
How can this be? A thought?

423
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,370
誰有答案？
Anyone.

424
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,000
大師
Master?

425
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:35,010
有人在記憶體裏將它清除掉
Because someone erased it from the archive memory.

426
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:42,780
這孩子果然聰明
Truly wonderful the mind of a child is.

427
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:47,360
這小徒弟說對了
The Padawan is right.

428
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,520
前往重力作用的中心點
Go to the center of gravity's pull...

429
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,690
你就會找到你要的行星
and find your planet you will.

430
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:02,840
資料一定是被刪除了
The data must have been erased.

431
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,380
可是，尤達大師
But who could empty information

432
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:07,710
誰做的？不太可能，不是嗎？
from the archives? Isn't that impossible?

433
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:11,210
的確是危機重重、疑雲密佈
Dangerous and disturbing this puzzle is.

434
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:15,550
刪除者必定是位絕地武士
Only a Jedi could have erased those files.

435
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:19,220
誰？為什麼？則更難回答
But who and why, harder to answer.

436
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,090
讓我好好沉思一番
Meditate on this I will.

437
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:50,090
我並非最年輕的民選女王
I wasn't the youngest queen ever elected...

438
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,490
但現在回想起來
but now that I think back on it, I'm not sure I was old enough.

439
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:55,960
可能真的太年輕，不夠有把握
I'm not sure I was ready.

440
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:59,160
你的同胞認為你很稱職
The people you served thought you did a good job.

441
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:03,200
為了讓你續任還企圖修訂憲法
I heard they even tried to amend the constitution... so you could stay in office.

442
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,930
兩任屆滿後終於得以退休
I was relieved when my two terms were up.

443
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:09,540
但繼任女王要我當參議員
But when the queen asked me to serve as senator...

444
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,270
我實在無法拒絕
I couldn't refuse her.

445
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:15,810
我贊同她，共和國需要你
I agree with her. I think the Republic needs you.

446
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:20,320
很高興你繼續為國服務
I'm glad that you chose to serve.

447
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:30,220
參議院若同意建軍會引發內戰
If the senate votes to create an army, it's sure to push us into a civil war.

448
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:32,260
不敢想像
It's unthinkable!

449
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,770
共和國成立後未曾有過戰爭
There hasn't been a full-scale war since the formation of the Republic.

450
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:40,600
和談不能挽回分離主義者嗎？
Do you see any way through negotiations... to bring the separatists back into the Republic?

451
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,730
除非感受到威脅不然不會同意
Not if they feel threatened.

452
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,780
我想他們會向貿易聯盟
They'll turn to the Trade Federations

453
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,210
或商業協會求救
or the Commerce Guilds for help.

454
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:50,850
可恥，最高法院已四度審判...
It's outrageous... but after four trials in the Supreme Court...

455
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,720
紐特甘雷仍穩坐貿易聯盟總督
Nute Gunray is still the viceroy of the Trade Federation.

456
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:58,850
恐怕參議院無力解決此次危機
I fear the senate is powerless to resolve this crisis.

457
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:03,230
對共和國要有信心
We must keep our faith in the Republic.

458
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:14,000
喪失民主信心就是失敗的到來
The day we stop believing democracy can work is the day we lose it.

459
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:16,800
希望這天永遠不會來
Let's pray that day never comes.

460
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:19,640
同時，我們也得顧慮你的安全
In the meantime, we must consider your own safety.

461
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:22,750
你有何建議，絕地大師？
What is your suggestion, MasterJedi?

462
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,570
安納金還不是絕地武士
Anakin's not a Jedi yet.

463
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,580
他還在學徒階段，我認為...
He's still a Padawan learner.

464
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:28,120
等一下
- But I was thinking-- - Hold on a minute.

465
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:32,060
抱歉，我想我該待在千湖區
Excuse me. I was thinking I would stay in the lake country.

466
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:34,050
那裏有些地方非常隱密
There are some places up there that are very isolated.

467
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,560
抱歉！安全問題由我負責
Excuse me. I'm in charge of security here, milady.

468
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:39,800
這裏是我的故鄉，我清楚
And this is my home. I know it very well.

469
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,330
這也是為什麼我們要回來
That is why we're here.

470
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:46,470
此事最好善用我的知識
I think it would be wise... if you took advantage of my knowledge in this instance.

471
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,200
對不起，殿下
Sorry, milady.

472
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:54,870
很好，就這麼決定
Perfect. It's settled, then.

473
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,090
在那兒，R4
There it is, R4, right where it should be.

474
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:13,230
正處於它失蹤的位置...卡密諾
Our missing planet Kamino.

475
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:53,240
絕地大師
MasterJedi.

476
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:56,700
首相恭候大駕光臨
The prime minister is expecting you.

477
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:59,140
等我？
- I'm expected?

478
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,300
當然
- Of course.

479
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:03,480
他急著見你呢
He is anxious to meet you.

480
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,780
經過這麼多年後...
After all these years...

481
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:12,150
我們以為你不會來了，這邊請
we were beginning to think you weren't coming. Now, please, this way.

482
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:26,960
容我引見拉瑪蘇
May I present Lama Su...

483
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:29,840
卡密諾的首相
prime minister of Kamino.

484
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:33,100
這位是絕地大師...
And this is MasterJedi--

485
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:35,180
歐比王肯諾比
Obi-Wan Kenobi.

486
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:38,610
希望你感到不虛此行
I trust you're going to enjoy your stay.

487
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:45,790
請坐，我們來談正事吧
Please. And now to business.

488
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:49,920
你一定很高興進度完全正常
You will be delighted to hear that we are on schedule.

489
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,960
已完成20萬單位
200,000 units are ready...

490
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,400
另有一百萬個正在生產中
with a million more well on the way.

491
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,430
真是...好消息
That's good news.

492
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:01,530
請轉告西佛迪雅大師...
Please tell your Master Sifo-Dyas...

493
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:05,170
他的訂單我們會準時交貨
that his order will be met on time.

494
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:07,270
對不起...哪位大師？
I'm sorry. Master--

495
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:10,410
絕地大師西佛迪雅還是...
Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas is still...

496
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:14,250
絕地議會的首席，不是嗎？
a leading member of theJedi Council, is he not?

497
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:18,150
西佛迪雅大師十年前就遇害了
Master Sifo-Dyas was killed almost ten years ago.

498
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:22,160
哦，我深感遺憾
I'm so sorry to hear that.

499
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:24,360
他一定會因為我為他...
But I'm sure he would have been proud of the army

500
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:26,490
建造的軍隊感到驕傲
we've built for him.

501
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,920
軍隊？
The army?

502
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,360
是的，複製人大軍
Yes, a clone army, and I must say...

503
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:35,070
可以說我們所造最精良的一批
one of the finest we've ever created.

504
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:39,750
我們大師訂製這支部隊時...
Tell me, Prime Minister... when my master first contacted you about the army...

505
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:41,800
曾說明用途嗎？
did he say who it was for?

506
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:43,810
當然有
Of course he did.

507
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,880
是要供共和國使用的
This army is for the Republic.

508
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:52,650
但你一定急著親自點閱
But you must be anxious to inspect the units for yourself.

509
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,890
正是我此行的目的
That's why I'm here.

510
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:18,410
學生時代常來此地靜修
We used to come here for school retreat.

511
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:22,110
每天游到那個小島
We would swim to that island every day.

512
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,850
我很喜歡這裏的水
I love the water.

513
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:33,100
躺在沙灘上作日光浴
We used to lie out on the sand and let the sun dry us...

514
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:36,870
猜愛唱歌鳥兒的名字
and try to guess the names of the birds singing.

515
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:41,370
我不喜歡沙子
I don't like sand.

516
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:46,380
又粗又亂使人過敏...
It's coarse and rough and irritating...

517
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,410
還沾得到處是
and it gets everywhere.

518
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:52,110
不像這裏
Not like here.

519
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:59,880
到處都很柔軟...光滑
Here, everything is soft... and smooth.

520
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:40,820
不行，我不該這麼做
No. I shouldn't have done that.

521
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:44,130
對不起
I'm sorry.

522
00:45:58,150 --> 00:45:59,210
真壯觀
Very impressive.

523
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:02,010
我想你會滿意
I'd hoped you would be pleased.

524
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:07,460
複製人具思考能力
Clones can think creatively.

525
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:12,090
你會發現他們比機器人好很多
You will find that they are immensely superior to droids.

526
00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:17,200
戰鬥教育和訓練課程...
We take great pride in our combat education

527
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:20,530
也令我們相當自傲
and training programs.

528
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:24,230
這一組是五年前開發出來的
This group was created about five years ago.

529
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:26,540
你剛提過加速成長
You mentioned growth acceleration.

530
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:28,670
那是必要的，不然...
Oh, yes, it's essential.

531
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:31,510
要等一輩子，複製人才能成熟
Otherwise, a mature clone would take a lifetime to grow.

532
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:34,310
現在只需要一半時間
Now we can do it in half the time.

533
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:35,780
我明白了
I see.

534
00:46:37,090 --> 00:46:41,830
絕對服從，絕不懷疑命令
They are totally obedient... taking any order without question.

535
00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:44,490
我們做了些基因改造...
We modified their genetic structure...

536
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:47,390
讓他們比母體較不具獨立性
to make them less independent than the original host.

537
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:49,830
他們的原始母體是誰？
And who was the original host?

538
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:52,230
賞金獵人強格費特
A bounty hunter called Jango Fett.

539
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:55,640
他現在在哪裏？
And where is this bounty hunter now?

540
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:59,110
我們將他留在此地
Oh, we keep him here.

541
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:03,670
除了巨額酬庸...
Apart from his pay, which is considerable...

542
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:06,150
費特只要求一件事
Fett demanded only one thing:

543
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:08,780
為他保留一個未改造的複製人
an unaltered clone for himself.

544
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:10,450
奇怪吧？
- Curious, isn't it?

545
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,520
未改造？
- ''Unaltered''?

546
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:14,120
純正基因的復製品
Pure genetic replication.

547
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:17,320
基因未曾馴化成較溫和
No tampering with the structure to make it more docile...

548
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:20,060
而且也不經加速成長處理
and no growth acceleration.

549
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:23,270
我想見見這位強格費特
I should very much like to meet this Jango Fett.

550
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:27,100
非常樂意為你安排
I would be very happy to arrange it for you.

551
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:47,890
壯觀吧？
Magnificent, aren't they?

552
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:54,830
我不知道
I don't know.

553
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,330
你當然知道，只是不跟我說
Sure you do. You just don't want to tell me.

554
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,870
你要用絕地念力控制我？
You gonna use one of your Jedi mind tricks on me?

555
00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:03,200
那只對心智虛弱者有效
They only work on the weak-minded.

556
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,610
好吧
All right.

557
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:08,510
我當時12歲，他叫帕羅
I was 1 2. His name was Palo.

558
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:11,080
我們參加青少年立法訓練營
We were both in the Legislative Youth Program.

559
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:14,150
他比我大幾歲，很可愛
He was a few years older than I. Very cute.

560
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:16,720
黑色卷髮，迷濛的眼神
Dark, curly hair. Dreamy eyes.

561
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:18,480
好，我有概念了
All right, I get the picture.

562
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,920
他後來怎麼了？
Whatever happened to him?

563
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:24,030
我從事公共服務，他當藝術家
I went into public service. He went on to become an artist.

564
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:25,960
或許他比較聰明
Maybe he was the smart one.

565
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:28,400
你真的不喜歡政治人物？
You really don't like politicians, do you?

566
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,730
有二、三個喜歡的...
I like two or three...

567
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:33,130
但有一個我還不太清楚
but I'm not really sure about one of them.

568
00:48:36,810 --> 00:48:38,940
我不覺得政府體系有任何功效
I don't think the system works.

569
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,840
你認為怎麼樣才有功效？
How would you have it work?

570
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:46,720
政治人物應該坐下來討論問題
We need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problem...

571
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:50,960
根據人民的最高福祉去做
agree what's in the best interest of all the people... and then do it.

572
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,620
這正是我們的做法
That's exactly what we do.

573
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,160
問題是，人民不會永遠同意
The trouble is that people don't always agree.

574
00:48:55,630 --> 00:48:57,150
應該說服他們
Well, then they should be made to.

575
00:48:57,660 --> 00:48:58,920
誰去說服？
- By whom? Who's gonna make them?

576
00:48:59,030 --> 00:49:00,620
我怎麼知道...某人
- I don't know. Someone.

577
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:01,360
你？
- You?

578
00:49:01,470 --> 00:49:02,560
當然不
- Of course not me.

579
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:03,690
但一定有某個人
- But someone.

580
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,390
某個有智慧的人
- Someone wise.

581
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:08,700
聽起來頗像獨裁政權
Sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me.

582
00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:13,880
只要是具有功效
Well, if it works.

583
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:21,480
你在開我玩笑
- You're making fun of me. - No.

584
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:24,850
我可不敢捉弄參議員大人
I'd be much too frightened to tease a senator.

585
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:06,420
安納？你還好吧？
Ani, are you all right?

586
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:45,770
波巴，你父親在嗎？
Boba, is your father here?

587
00:50:46,770 --> 00:50:47,760
在
Yep.

588
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:49,970
可以見他嗎？
May we see him?

589
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:51,710
當然
Sure.

590
00:50:54,350 --> 00:50:57,110
爸，道維來找你
Dad, Taun We's here.

591
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:12,390
強格，歡迎回來
Jango, welcome back.

592
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:14,490
這趟旅行收穫豐富嗎？
Was your trip productive?

593
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:16,030
還好
Fairly.

594
00:51:16,270 --> 00:51:20,470
這位是絕地大師歐比王肯諾比
This is Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi.

595
00:51:20,570 --> 00:51:23,560
他來視察進度的
He's come to check on our progress.

596
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:24,900
你的複製人很棒
Your clones are very impressive.

597
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:26,640
你一定感到相當驕傲
You must be very proud.

598
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:29,780
只是在宇宙中混口飯吃
I'm just a simple man trying to make my way in the universe.

599
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:33,540
你曾經到過科羅森嗎？
Ever made your way as far into the interior as Coruscant?

600
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:35,250
一、二次吧
- Once or twice.

601
00:51:35,390 --> 00:51:36,550
最近呢？
- Recently?

602
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:39,890
有可能
Possibly.

603
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:43,050
那你一定認識西佛迪雅大師
Then you must know Master Sifo-Dyas.

604
00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:49,160
波巴，把門關上
Boba, rood eht so-heeck.

605
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:51,900
哪位大師？
Master who?

606
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:55,330
西佛迪雅
Sifo-Dyas.

607
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:58,670
不是他聘雇你做這項工作嗎？
Is he not theJedi who hired you for this job?

608
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:03,500
沒聽說過他
Never heard of him.

609
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:07,510
真的？
Really?

610
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:12,620
柏格登衛星的提拉諾斯聘我的
I was recruited by a man called Tyranus on one of the moons of Bogden.

611
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,020
奇怪
Curious.

612
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:19,460
軍隊你還滿意嗎？
Do you like your army?

613
00:52:21,370 --> 00:52:23,390
我想看他們的戰鬥表現
I look forward to seeing them in action.

614
00:52:24,670 --> 00:52:28,040
驍勇善戰，我保證
They'll do their job well. I'll guarantee that.

615
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:30,680
多謝接見，強格
Thank you for your time,Jango.

616
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:34,170
我一向樂於接待絕地武士
Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi.

617
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:54,520
怎麼回事，爸？
What is it, Dad?

618
00:52:57,070 --> 00:52:59,090
收拾行李，我們得離開
Pack your things. We're leaving.

619
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:06,270
找到他們後，我們...
And when I got to them,

620
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:07,740
激烈的爭辯一番
we went into aggressive negotiations.

621
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:08,510
謝謝

622
00:53:08,610 --> 00:53:10,410
怎麼個「激烈的爭辯」？
''Aggressive negotiations''? What's that?

623
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:14,250
呃...用光劍爭辯
Well, negotiations with a lightsaber.

624
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:28,690
如果被歐比王看到我這樣做
If Master Obi-Wan caught me doing this,

625
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,500
他會抓狂
he'd be very grumpy.

626
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:02,230
自從與你相識...
From the moment I met you...

627
00:54:02,870 --> 00:54:04,630
...好多年以前的事了...
all those years ago...

628
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:08,170
我沒有一天不想你
not a day has gone by when I haven't thought of you.

629
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:13,410
今天再度與你相遇...
And now that I'm with you again...

630
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:15,940
我反而覺得很痛苦
I'm in agony.

631
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:23,020
越接近你就越痛苦
The closer I get to you, the worse it gets.

632
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:26,280
一想到不能跟你在一起...
The thought of not being with you--

633
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:28,890
連氣都快喘不過來
I can't breathe.

634
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:34,860
我仍被你的吻迷惑著
I'm haunted by the kiss...

635
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:37,830
你不該吻我的
that you should never have given me.

636
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:40,700
我內心惴惴不安...
My heart is beating...

637
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:43,910
希望它不會變成愛的傷痕
hoping that that kiss will not become a scar.

638
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:51,040
你在我靈魂深處，折磨著我
You are in my very soul... tormenting me.

639
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:54,910
我該怎麼辦呢？
What can I do?

640
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:57,850
只要你說，我一定照做
I will do anything that you ask.

641
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:09,260
如果你跟我一樣深受折磨...
If you are suffering as much as I am,

642
00:55:09,370 --> 00:55:11,200
請你說出來
please, tell me.

643
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:14,460
我不能說
I can't.

644
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:19,470
我們不能在一起，不可能的
We can't. It's...just not possible.

645
00:55:19,610 --> 00:55:22,550
什麼事都有可能，聽我說...
Anything is possible, Padme. Listen to me.

646
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:24,440
不，你聽我說
No, you listen.

647
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:29,050
我們活在現實世界，醒來吧
We live in a real world. Come back to it.

648
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:31,090
你專心學習當絕地武士...
You're studying to become a Jedi.

649
00:55:31,190 --> 00:55:32,710
我當我的參議員
I'm a senator.

650
00:55:34,890 --> 00:55:37,090
跟著你的感覺走下去的話...
If you follow your thoughts through to conclusion...

651
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,690
只會走到無法收拾的地步...
it'll take us to a place we cannot go...

652
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:43,170
不管我們對彼此有什麼感覺
regardless of the way we feel about each other.

653
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,300
這麼說，你也有感覺
Then you do feel something.

654
00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:48,370
我不會讓你為我放棄前途
I will not let you give up your future for me.

655
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:51,570
你要我保持理智
You are asking me to be rational.

656
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:54,110
這一點我做不到
That is something I know I cannot do.

657
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:59,120
但願我能忘卻這份感情...
Believe me, I wish that I could just wish away my feelings...

658
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:00,650
但我做不到
but I can't.

659
00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:04,220
我不會兒女情長的
I will not give in to this.

660
00:56:11,630 --> 00:56:13,060
你知道嗎...
Well, you know...

661
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,020
事情不一定非這樣不可
it wouldn't have to be that way.

662
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:19,600
我們可以偷偷相愛
We could keep it a secret.

663
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:23,270
那我們必須活在謊言中
We'd be living a lie...

664
00:56:23,370 --> 00:56:25,710
紙是包不住火的
one we couldn't keep even if we wanted to.

665
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:28,080
我不能這麼做
I couldn't do that.

666
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:31,410
你可以嗎？過那種日子？
Could you, Anakin? Could you live like that?

667
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:37,510
不可以，你說得對
No. You're right.

668
00:56:38,490 --> 00:56:40,510
我們會被毀了
It would destroy us.

669
00:56:48,270 --> 00:56:52,000
告訴議會，第一支軍隊備妥了
Tell your council that the first battalions are ready.

670
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:55,440
提醒他們，如果需要更多軍隊
And remind them, if they need more troops...

671
00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:58,670
將需要更多時間培育他們
it will take more time to grow them.

672
00:56:58,810 --> 00:57:00,710
謹記在心，多謝
I won't forget, and thank you.

673
00:57:00,810 --> 00:57:01,940
謝謝
Thank you.

674
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:19,460
R4！
R4!

675
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:22,460
用第5密碼加密傳訊到科羅森
Scramble code five to Coruscant,

676
00:57:22,570 --> 00:57:24,400
收件人寫「養老院」
care of the old folks' home!

677
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:34,200
我跟卡密諾首相碰過面
I have successfully made contact with the prime minister of Kamino.

678
00:57:34,610 --> 00:57:36,510
他們用賞金獵人強格費特...
They are using a bounty hunter named

679
00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:38,240
作為母體製造一支複製人大軍
Jango Fett to create a clone army.

680
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:43,080
我覺得這位賞金獵人就是刺客
I have a strong feeling that this bounty hunter... is the assassin we are looking for.

681
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:44,950
你認為訂製複製人的人...
Do you think these cloners are involved...

682
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:47,290
跟刺殺陰謀有關？
in the plot to assassinate Senator Amidala?

683
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:50,120
不，大師，似乎無此動機
No, Master. There appears to be no motive.

684
00:57:50,530 --> 00:57:53,290
不要假設，歐比王
Do not assume anything, Obi-Wan.

685
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:56,330
一定要先清除雜念...
Clear your mind must be...

686
00:57:56,430 --> 00:58:00,630
如果你想查出幕後的主謀
if you are to discover the real villains behind this plot.

687
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:02,840
是的，大師，他們說...
Yes, Master.

688
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:05,810
複製人是西佛迪雅大師訂製的
They say Master Sifo-Dyas placed an order for a clone army...

689
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:09,180
根據十年前參議院的要求
at the request of the senate almost ten years ago.

690
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:15,210
印象中，他在那之前已遇害
I was under the impression he was killed before that.

691
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:18,820
絕地議會有授權訂製複製人？
Did the council ever authorize the creation of a clone army?

692
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:20,580
沒有，不管訂製者是誰
No. Whoever placed that order...

693
00:58:20,690 --> 00:58:23,220
絕地議會並未授權
did not have the authorization of theJedi Council.

694
00:58:23,390 --> 00:58:27,560
帶他來，我們當面對質
Bring him here. Question him we will.

695
00:58:28,230 --> 00:58:31,260
是的，找到他後再行報告
Yes, Master. I will report back when I have him.

696
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:34,100
我們真是盲目啊...
Blind we are if creation of this clone army...

697
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:38,730
竟然不知複製人悄悄在生產
we could not see.

698
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:44,210
我們得通知參議院，我們...
I think it is time we informed the senate...

699
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:46,410
運用原力的能力已大為減弱
that our ability to use the Force has diminished.

700
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:49,550
只有西斯的黑暗大帝...
Only the dark lord of the Sith

701
00:58:49,650 --> 00:58:51,490
明明白我們的弱點
knows of our weakness.

702
00:58:51,590 --> 00:58:53,820
通知參議院...
If informed the senate is...

703
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:56,720
只會讓我們的處境更加窘迫
multiply our adversaries will.

704
00:58:58,260 --> 00:58:59,890
不
No.

705
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:07,190
媽...不...不要！
Mom, no.

706
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:34,960
不要走
Don't go.

707
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:39,700
我不想打擾你
I don't want to disturb you.

708
00:59:41,270 --> 00:59:43,470
你的出現有安撫作用
Your presence is soothing.

709
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:48,480
你昨晚又作惡夢了
You had another nightmare last night.

710
00:59:49,550 --> 00:59:51,570
絕地武士不會作惡夢
Jedi don't have nightmares.

711
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:53,780
我聽見了
I heard you.

712
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:00,980
我夢見我的母親
I saw my mother.

713
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:06,420
她正受著苦，帕米
She is suffering, Padme.

714
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:11,730
見到她跟見到你一樣清晰
I saw her as clearly as I see you now.

715
01:00:23,380 --> 01:00:24,940
她很痛苦
She is in pain.

716
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:30,510
我知道這會違抗保護你的命令
I know I'm disobeying my mandate to protect you, Senator...

717
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:32,590
但，我得去一趟
but I have to go.

718
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:37,090
我必須去救她
I have to help her.

719
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:40,700
我跟你一起去
I'll go with you.

720
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:43,790
很抱歉，我別無選擇
I'm sorry. I don't have a choice.

721
01:00:54,710 --> 01:00:56,480
爸！你看！
Dad, look!

722
01:00:57,550 --> 01:00:58,980
波巴，快上船！
Boba, get on board!

723
01:02:15,990 --> 01:02:16,760
不妙
Oh, not good.

724
01:04:27,460 --> 01:04:28,620
在這裏等著
Wait right there.

725
01:04:28,790 --> 01:04:30,780
好
Okey-okey.

726
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:34,790
你好，瓦頭
Chut-chut, Watto.

727
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:39,100
我來幫你忙
Let me help you with that.

728
01:04:39,970 --> 01:04:43,500
什麼？你想幹嘛？
What? What do you want?

729
01:04:43,740 --> 01:04:46,110
等等，你是絕地武士
Wait! You're a Jedi!

730
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:49,340
不管是什麼問題，不是我幹的
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.

731
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:57,250
我來找西蜜天行者
I'm looking for Shmi Skywalker.

732
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:05,420
安納？小安納？
Ani? Little Ani?

733
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:15,000
是安納！真的是你！
You are Ani! It is you!

734
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:19,070
長好高了
You sure sprouted, huh?

735
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:23,440
絕地武士！真是個驚喜
AJedi! Whattaya know!

736
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:29,990
或許可以幫我催收些爛帳
Maybe you could help with some deadbeats who owe me a lot of money.

737
01:05:30,250 --> 01:05:31,550
我母親呢？
My mother.

738
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:34,280
哦，對了，西蜜
Oh, yeah. Shmi.

739
01:05:35,930 --> 01:05:38,860
她不歸我了，我將她賣了
She's not mine-a no more-a. I sold her.

740
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:39,760
賣了？
- You sold her?

741
01:05:39,860 --> 01:05:41,260
很多年了
- Years ago.

742
01:05:41,430 --> 01:05:45,460
抱歉，安納，生意歸生意
Sorry, Ani, but you know, business is business.

743
01:05:45,570 --> 01:05:49,300
賣給個水氣收集農夫，叫拉斯
I sold her to a moisture farmer named Lars.

744
01:05:49,410 --> 01:05:51,310
我記得應該是拉斯
At least I think it was Lars.

745
01:05:51,410 --> 01:05:53,040
信不信由你，聽說...
Believe it or not, I heard

746
01:05:53,140 --> 01:05:55,140
他給她自由並跟她結婚了！
he freed her and married her!

747
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:57,650
想不到有這種好事吧
Can ya beat that, eh?

748
01:06:00,350 --> 01:06:01,820
知不知道他們現在在哪？
Do you know where they are now?

749
01:06:02,990 --> 01:06:04,980
離這兒很遠
Long way from here.

750
01:06:05,090 --> 01:06:09,550
應該在摩斯艾斯裏港的那頭吧
Someplace over on the other side of Mos Eisley, I think.

751
01:06:10,330 --> 01:06:11,790
我想知道
I'd like to know.

752
01:06:13,330 --> 01:06:16,230
沒問題，當然！
Sure. Absolutely!

753
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:20,400
去查查我的記錄
Let's go look at my records, huh?

754
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:50,790
爸！我們被盯梢了！
Dad! I think we're being tracked!

755
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:53,690
一定有追蹤器粘在我們船身上
He must have put a homing device on our hull.

756
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:56,730
坐好，我們將進入小行星群裏
Hang on, son. We'll move into the asteroid field...

757
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:59,820
讓他開開眼界
and we'll have a couple of surprises for him.

758
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:14,140
震碎炮待命
Seismic charges! Stand by.

759
01:07:39,540 --> 01:07:41,940
他好像還是不懂我的意思
He doesn't seem to take a hint, this guy.

760
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:01,960
小心！
Watch out!

761
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:23,350
幹掉他，爸！幹掉他！
Get him, Dad!

762
01:08:23,820 --> 01:08:24,440
發射！
Fire!

763
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:28,920
要命！我真恨飛行
Blast! This is why I hate flying!

764
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:50,440
打中了！
We got him!

765
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:52,580
再給他致命的一擊
We'll just have to finish him.

766
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:21,590
R4，準備拋棄備用零件
R4, prepare to jettison the spare part canisters.

767
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:26,800
拋射！
Fire them now!

768
01:09:40,310 --> 01:09:42,150
再也不會見面了
We won't be seeing him again.

769
01:10:17,650 --> 01:10:19,550
R4，我們等得夠久了
Well, R4, I think we've waited long enough.

770
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:44,040
聯盟船艦不尋常的在此集結
There's an unusual concentration of Federation ships over there, R4.

771
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:21,880
在此留守，R2
Stay with the ship, R2.

772
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:40,660
哈羅，需要效勞嗎？我是C...
Hello. How might I be of service? I am C--

773
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:41,960
3PO？
3PO?

774
01:11:44,970 --> 01:11:48,170
創造者！噢，安納主人！
The maker! Master Ani!

775
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:50,580
我就知道你會回來！
I knew you would return. I knew it!

776
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:53,310
還有帕米小姐，噢，天啊
And Miss Padme. Oh, my.

777
01:11:53,410 --> 01:11:54,570
哈羅，3PO
Hello, 3PO.

778
01:11:55,350 --> 01:11:58,580
上蒼保佑，真高興見到二位
Bless my circuits! I'm so pleased to see you both.

779
01:11:59,220 --> 01:12:00,690
我來找我母親的
I've come to see my mother.

780
01:12:00,820 --> 01:12:05,120
我們進去屋裏吧
I think perhaps we'd better go indoors.

781
01:12:07,390 --> 01:12:11,990
歐文主人，為你介紹兩位貴客
Master Owen, might I present two most important visitors.

782
01:12:12,170 --> 01:12:13,960
我是安納金天行者
I'm Anakin Skywalker.

783
01:12:15,970 --> 01:12:19,670
歐文拉斯，我女朋友蓓魯
Owen Lars. - This is my girlfriend, Beru. - Hello.

784
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:21,530
我叫帕米
I'm Padme.

785
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:24,410
我應該是你的同母異父弟弟吧
I guess I'm your stepbrother.

786
01:12:24,510 --> 01:12:26,740
我一直感覺有一天你會來
I had a feeling you might show up someday.

787
01:12:28,550 --> 01:12:30,240
我母親在嗎？
Is my mother here?

788
01:12:30,350 --> 01:12:31,820
不，她不在
No, she's not.

789
01:12:32,850 --> 01:12:36,910
克裏格拉斯，西蜜是我太太
Cliegg Lars. Shmi is my wife.

790
01:12:37,790 --> 01:12:39,160
我們進去
We should go inside.

791
01:12:39,530 --> 01:12:41,220
有很多事情該談談
We have a lot to talk about.

792
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:50,730
就在黎明前夕
It was just before dawn. They came out of nowhere.

793
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:55,240
突然冒出一群塔斯肯強盜
A hunting party ofTusken Raiders.

794
01:12:55,740 --> 01:12:57,510
你母親照例一大早起來...
Your mother had gone out early, like she always did...

795
01:12:57,610 --> 01:13:02,610
采收凝結器上的蘑菇
to pick mushrooms that grow on the vaporators.

796
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:07,120
從足跡看來，她回到半路上...
From the tracks, she was about halfway home...

797
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:08,380
卻被擄走了
when they took her.

798
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:12,190
塔斯肯族走路像人，可是...
Those Tuskens walk like men...

799
01:13:12,190 --> 01:13:16,790
他們很兇惡... 是冷酷的怪物
but they're vicious, mindless monsters.

800
01:13:18,470 --> 01:13:21,630
30人前去營救，只有4人回來
Thirty of us went out after her. Four of us came back.

801
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:26,700
我也想去，可是腿斷了後...
I'd be out there with them, but after I lost my leg...

802
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:29,910
無法駕駛
I just couldn't ride anymore

803
01:13:30,810 --> 01:13:32,470
只好等痊癒再想辦法
until I heal.

804
01:13:33,110 --> 01:13:35,310
我不會放棄搜救
I don't want to give up on her...

805
01:13:35,650 --> 01:13:37,510
只是她失蹤幾個月了
but she's been gone a month.

806
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:41,850
活存那麼久的機會不大
There's little hope she's lasted this long.

807
01:13:46,060 --> 01:13:47,390
你要去哪裏？
Where are you going?

808
01:13:48,730 --> 01:13:50,200
去找我母親
To find my mother.

809
01:13:51,770 --> 01:13:54,960
你母親死了，接受事實吧
Your mother's dead, son. Accept it.

810
01:14:16,820 --> 01:14:18,350
你留在這裏
You're gonna have to stay here.

811
01:14:19,930 --> 01:14:22,390
他們是好人，沒有危險
These are good people, Padme. You'll be safe.

812
01:14:23,230 --> 01:14:24,250
安納金...
Anakin

813
01:14:35,210 --> 01:14:36,570
我很快就回來
I won't be long.

814
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:30,820
商業協會和企業聯盟必須簽約
We must persuade the Commerce Guild... and the Corporate Alliance to sign the treaty.

815
01:16:30,990 --> 01:16:34,260
那卜星的參議員怎麼對付？
What about the senator from Naboo?

816
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:36,260
她還沒死嗎？
Is she dead yet?

817
01:16:36,860 --> 01:16:40,820
除非看到她的頭，否則我不簽
I am not signing your treaty until I have her head on my desk.

818
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:43,330
我以信譽保證，總督
I am a man of my word, Viceroy.

819
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:46,670
有了我們打造的戰鬥機器人...
With these new battle droids we've built for you...

820
01:16:46,770 --> 01:16:50,040
你擁有全銀河最精良的部隊
you'll have the finest army in the galaxy.

821
01:17:00,620 --> 01:17:02,180
正如我先前解釋過的...
As I explained to you earlier...

822
01:17:02,290 --> 01:17:06,020
又將有一萬多個星系...
I am quite convinced that 1 0,000 more systems...

823
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:07,290
加入我們的行動...
will rally to our cause

824
01:17:07,390 --> 01:17:08,920
只要你們肯支持
with your support, gentlemen.

825
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:12,790
你的提議可被視為叛國罪
What you are proposing could be construed as treason.

826
01:17:13,570 --> 01:17:16,030
科技聯邦的機器人...
The Techno Union army...

827
01:17:18,770 --> 01:17:21,400
...悉聽您的差遣，伯爵
is at your disposal, Count.

828
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:25,940
銀行公會願意簽署條約
The Banking Clan will sign your treaty.

829
01:17:26,050 --> 01:17:27,840
好，很好
Good. Very good.

830
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:32,540
貿易聯盟的朋友們已誓言支持
Our friends from the Trade Federation have pledged their support...

831
01:17:32,650 --> 01:17:35,380
他們的戰鬥機器人加上你們的
and when their battle droids are combined with yours...

832
01:17:35,490 --> 01:17:39,190
我們將擁有銀河最強大的軍隊
we shall have an army greater than any in the galaxy.

833
01:17:39,290 --> 01:17:42,490
絕地武士根本不是對手
TheJedi will be overwhelmed.

834
01:17:43,230 --> 01:17:47,190
共和國將任憑我們宰割
The Republic will agree to any demands we make.

835
01:18:47,860 --> 01:18:49,490
媽？媽？
Mom?

836
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:54,270
安納
Ani?

837
01:18:55,270 --> 01:19:00,200
安納...是你嗎？
Ani? Is it you?

838
01:19:00,210 --> 01:19:01,500
我來找你了，媽
I'm here, Mom.

839
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:04,140
你安全了
You're safe.

840
01:19:05,010 --> 01:19:09,510
安納？
Ani?

841
01:19:11,050 --> 01:19:13,180
你長得好帥
You look so handsome.

842
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:18,390
我的兒子...
My son.

843
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:21,720
我長大成人的兒子
My grown-up son.

844
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,360
我以你為榮，安納
I'm so proud of you, Ani.

845
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:27,160
我好想你
I missed you.

846
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:32,230
我死而無憾了
Now I am complete.

847
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:40,310
我愛你...
I love y--

848
01:19:42,380 --> 01:19:44,150
不要丟下我，媽
Stay with me, Mom.

849
01:19:44,820 --> 01:19:46,510
一切...
Everything--

850
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:50,450
我愛...
I love--

851
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:52,530
我...愛...
I love--

852
01:20:49,050 --> 01:20:50,980
安納金！安納金！
Anakin!

853
01:20:51,450 --> 01:20:52,980
不！
No!

854
01:21:13,970 --> 01:21:14,960
怎麼回事？
What is it?

855
01:21:15,910 --> 01:21:19,710
痛苦...掙扎...
Pain, suffering...

856
01:21:20,050 --> 01:21:22,110
...死亡，我感覺到了
death I feel.

857
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:30,320
恐怖的事發生了
Something terrible has happened.

858
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:35,520
年少天行者遭逢苦難
Young Skywalker is in pain...

859
01:21:35,630 --> 01:21:37,650
極大的痛苦
terrible pain.

860
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:45,730
傳輸器沒故障，但毫無回音
The transmitter is working, but we're not receiving a return signal.

861
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:48,710
科羅森太遠，能加強功率嗎？
Coruscant's too far. R4, can you boost the power?

862
01:21:50,180 --> 01:21:52,200
我們得另外想辦法
We'll have to try something else.

863
01:21:55,050 --> 01:21:58,350
嘗試連絡在那卜星的安納金
Maybe we can contact Anakin on Naboo.

864
01:21:58,450 --> 01:21:59,980
那兒近多了
It's much closer.

865
01:22:02,090 --> 01:22:04,320
安納金？聽得到嗎？
Anakin, do you copy?

866
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:07,220
我是歐比王，安納金？
This is Obi-Wan Kenobi. Anakin?

867
01:22:07,660 --> 01:22:09,590
他不在那卜星上，R4
He's not on Naboo, R4.

868
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:13,890
我試試加大頻寬
I'm going to try and widen the range.

869
01:22:17,140 --> 01:22:18,760
希望他沒出什麼亂子
I do hope nothing's happened to him.

870
01:22:26,350 --> 01:22:28,180
那是安納金的追蹤訊號
That's Anakin's tracking signal, all right...

871
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:31,020
但它來自塔圖印
but it's coming from Tatooine.

872
01:22:32,150 --> 01:22:34,810
他去那裏幹什麼？
What in the blazes is he doing there?

873
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:36,910
跟他說過好好待在那卜星
I told him to stay on Naboo.

874
01:22:40,490 --> 01:22:41,930
我們沒有什麼時間
We haven't got much time.

875
01:22:42,230 --> 01:22:46,560
安納金，聽到嗎？我是歐比王
Anakin, do you copy? This is Obi-Wan Kenobi.

876
01:22:54,810 --> 01:22:56,430
重新傳輸訊息
Retransmit this message--

877
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:01,040
安納金？聽得到嗎？安納金？
Anakin, do you copy?

878
01:23:01,550 --> 01:23:03,610
我的長程...故障
My long-range transmitter has been knocked out.

879
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:05,980
本將訊息轉傳至科羅森
Retransmit this message to Coruscant.

880
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:51,800
吃點東西嗎？
I brought you something.

881
01:23:53,130 --> 01:23:54,430
餓不餓？
Are you hungry?

882
01:23:56,500 --> 01:23:57,900
排檔桿壞了
The shifter broke.

883
01:24:00,470 --> 01:24:03,470
修東西時生活顯得單純多了
Life seems so much simpler when you're fixing things.

884
01:24:05,750 --> 01:24:07,710
我對修理東西很在行
I'm good at fixing things. Always was.

885
01:24:08,210 --> 01:24:13,490
一向如此，但我不能...
But I couldn't--

886
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:19,090
為什麼她非死不可？
Why'd she have to die?

887
01:24:22,860 --> 01:24:27,160
為什麼我救不了她？我可以的
Why couldn't I save her? I know I could have!

888
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:32,600
有時候天命難違
Sometimes there are things no one can fix.

889
01:24:34,070 --> 01:24:35,270
你無法擁有無上的力量，安納
- You're not all-powerful, Ani.

890
01:24:35,370 --> 01:24:36,810
我應該可以的
- Well, I should be!

891
01:24:39,580 --> 01:24:41,570
有一天我一定可以
Someday I will be.

892
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:45,010
我會成為史上最強的絕地武士
I will be the most powerfulJedi ever.

893
01:24:46,390 --> 01:24:48,150
我說到做到
I promise you.

894
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:51,390
甚至學會讓人長生不老
I will even learn to stop people from dying.

895
01:24:52,490 --> 01:24:53,580
安納金
Anakin

896
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:57,120
都是歐比王的錯
It's all Obi-Wan's fault!

897
01:24:57,900 --> 01:24:59,160
他嫉妒我！
He's jealous!

898
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:00,860
他阻礙我進步
He's holding me back!

899
01:25:05,540 --> 01:25:07,270
怎麼回事，安納金？
What's wrong, Ani?

900
01:25:18,350 --> 01:25:19,720
我殺了他們
I killed them.

901
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:23,620
我把他們全殺了
I killed them all.

902
01:25:25,630 --> 01:25:26,960
他們都死了
They're dead.

903
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:30,090
一個都不留活口
Every single one of them.

904
01:25:32,130 --> 01:25:33,690
不只是男人...
And not just the men...

905
01:25:36,070 --> 01:25:40,270
連婦女和小孩無一倖免
but the women... and the children too.

906
01:25:41,870 --> 01:25:43,240
他們跟野獸沒什麼兩樣！
They're like animals...

907
01:25:43,510 --> 01:25:45,880
我像殺野獸一樣宰了他們！
and I slaughtered them like animals!

908
01:25:47,450 --> 01:25:48,810
我恨他們！
I hate them!

909
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,090
你這麼憤怒是很正常的
To be angry is to be human.

910
01:26:09,900 --> 01:26:11,600
但我是絕地武士
I'm a Jedi.

911
01:26:12,270 --> 01:26:14,400
我知道我應該要看破一切
I know I'm better than this.

912
01:26:27,990 --> 01:26:30,510
我知道，不管你在哪裏...
I know wherever you are

913
01:26:30,620 --> 01:26:32,680
那個地方都會變得更美好
it's become a better place.

914
01:26:32,930 --> 01:26:34,720
你是男人一生中...
You were the most loving partner

915
01:26:35,490 --> 01:26:37,930
最難得的可愛伴侶
a man could ever have.

916
01:26:40,730 --> 01:26:42,700
再見了，親愛的妻子
Good-bye, my darling wife.

917
01:26:46,870 --> 01:26:48,200
也謝謝你
And thank you.

918
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,970
我不夠強，沒救到你，媽
I wasn't strong enough to save you, Mom.

919
01:27:21,410 --> 01:27:22,810
我還不夠強
I wasn't strong enough.

920
01:27:27,250 --> 01:27:28,740
但我發誓...
But I promise

921
01:27:29,380 --> 01:27:31,210
我以後不會再失敗
I won't fail again.

922
01:27:41,590 --> 01:27:47,060
我想你，我好想你
I miss you... so much.

923
01:27:54,440 --> 01:27:56,670
R2，有什麼事？
R2? What are you doing here?

924
01:27:59,510 --> 01:28:00,950
它好像收到一個叫...
It seems that he is carrying

925
01:28:01,080 --> 01:28:03,810
歐比王肯諾比傳來的訊息
a message from an Obi-Wan Kenobi.

926
01:28:04,650 --> 01:28:07,590
安納主人，聽過這名字嗎？
Master Ani, does that name mean anything to you?

927
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:12,750
長程傳輸器故障
Anakin, my long-range transmitter has been knocked out.

928
01:28:12,860 --> 01:28:14,880
我將訊息轉傳至科羅森
Retransmit this message to Coruscant.

929
01:28:19,330 --> 01:28:21,300
我跟隨賞金獵人強格費特...
I have tracked the bounty hunter, Jango Fett...

930
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:23,870
來到機器人生產地吉諾西斯
to the droid foundries on Geonosis.

931
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:27,500
貿易聯盟到此點收機器人軍隊
The Trade Federation is to take delivery of a droid army here...

932
01:28:27,610 --> 01:28:29,730
很明顯甘雷總督...
and it is clear that Viceroy Gunray...

933
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:33,310
是行刺艾米達拉議員的主謀
is behind the assassination attempts on Senator Amidala.

934
01:28:33,550 --> 01:28:35,540
商業協會和企業聯盟...
The Commerce Guilds and the Corporate Alliance...

935
01:28:35,650 --> 01:28:37,910
雙雙帶兵投靠杜酷伯爵
have both pledged their armies to Count Dooku and are forming--

936
01:28:38,020 --> 01:28:41,580
形成...等一下
Wait.

937
01:28:52,530 --> 01:28:55,400
吉諾西斯進行著的陰謀...
More happening on Geonosis, I feel,

938
01:28:55,500 --> 01:28:57,030
遠比我們所知的嚴重
than has been revealed.

939
01:28:57,240 --> 01:29:00,210
我同意，安納金...
I agree.

940
01:29:00,340 --> 01:29:02,500
我們會對付杜酷
We will deal with Count Dooku.

941
01:29:02,610 --> 01:29:05,810
你一定要留在目前的所在地
The most important thing for you is to stay where you are.

942
01:29:06,750 --> 01:29:09,080
盡全力保護參議員
Protect the senator at all costs.

943
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:12,140
這是你的首要之務
That is your first priority.

944
01:29:13,190 --> 01:29:15,090
我懂，大師
Understood, Master.

945
01:29:15,190 --> 01:29:16,550
他們無法及時趕過去
They'll never get there in time to save him.

946
01:29:16,660 --> 01:29:19,250
他們遠在銀河的另一邊
They have to come halfway across the galaxy.

947
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:23,090
你看，吉諾西斯...
Look.Geonosis

948
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:24,790
離我們不到一秒差的距離
is less than a parsec away.

949
01:29:25,430 --> 01:29:27,190
那是假設如果他還活著的話
If he's still alive.

950
01:29:28,700 --> 01:29:31,300
你就坐視他面臨死亡？
Are you just gonna sit here and let him die?

951
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:32,460
他是你朋友，你...
- He's your friend, your mentor.

952
01:29:32,570 --> 01:29:34,040
他有如我的父親！
- He's like my father!

953
01:29:35,370 --> 01:29:38,830
但雲杜大師命我留在此地！
But you heard Master Windu. He gave me strict orders to stay here.

954
01:29:39,610 --> 01:29:42,240
他命令你保護我
He gave you strict orders to protect me...

955
01:29:42,350 --> 01:29:44,320
而我要前去協助歐比王
and I'm going to help Obi-Wan.

956
01:29:45,820 --> 01:29:49,250
要保護我就跟我一起去
If you plan to protect me, you'll just have to come along.

957
01:29:53,330 --> 01:29:57,160
我不擔心，R2，只是我沒飛過
I'm not worried, R2. It's just I've never flown before.

958
01:30:07,110 --> 01:30:10,010
商業協會正在備戰
The Commerce Guilds are preparing for war. There can be no doubt of that.

959
01:30:10,110 --> 01:30:12,040
杜酷一定跟他們簽署了條約
Count Dooku must have made a treaty with them.

960
01:30:12,450 --> 01:30:15,140
辯論終結！
The debate is over.

961
01:30:15,250 --> 01:30:18,580
我們需要複製人軍隊
Now we need that clone army.

962
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:21,650
可惜，辯論還沒終結
Unfortunately, the debate is not over.

963
01:30:21,750 --> 01:30:24,250
分離主義者攻擊前...
The senate will never approve the use of clones...

964
01:30:24,390 --> 01:30:26,090
參議院不會同意使用複製人
before the separatists attack.

965
01:30:26,290 --> 01:30:28,280
這是重大危機！參議院應該...
This is a crisis.

966
01:30:28,390 --> 01:30:30,830
投票賦予議長緊急處分權
The senate must vote the chancellor emergency powers.

967
01:30:30,930 --> 01:30:34,630
然後他有權同意建軍
He can then approve the creation of an army.

968
01:30:34,730 --> 01:30:36,890
但哪位參議員有這個膽子...
But what senator would have the courage...

969
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,700
敢提出這種激進的修正案？
to propose such a radical amendment?

970
01:30:40,170 --> 01:30:44,270
如果艾米達拉議員在就好了
If only Senator Amidala were here.

971
01:31:05,130 --> 01:31:06,160
叛徒！
Traitor.

972
01:31:07,670 --> 01:31:10,930
不，我的朋友，你錯了
Oh, no, my friend. This is a mistake, a terrible mistake.

973
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:11,930
他們做得太過分了
They have gone too far.

974
01:31:12,040 --> 01:31:12,970
簡直是瘋狂
This is madness.

975
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:15,670
我以為你是這兒的領袖，杜酷
I thought you were the leader here, Dooku.

976
01:31:16,210 --> 01:31:18,400
這件事與我無關
This had nothing to do with me, I assure you.

977
01:31:18,980 --> 01:31:21,910
我會立刻申請釋放你
I will petition immediately to have you set free.

978
01:31:22,010 --> 01:31:25,710
希望快一點，我有任務在身
Well, I hope it doesn't take too long. I have work to do.

979
01:31:26,250 --> 01:31:29,620
容我請問為何絕地武士...
May I ask why a Jedi knight...

980
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:32,190
大老遠來到吉諾西斯？
is all the way out here on Geonosis?

981
01:31:32,790 --> 01:31:35,260
我追蹤賞金獵人強格費特到此
I've been tracking a bounty hunter named Jango Fett.

982
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:36,330
你認識他嗎？
Do you know him?

983
01:31:36,900 --> 01:31:39,630
此地沒有賞金獵人
There are no bounty hunters here that I am aware of.

984
01:31:39,730 --> 01:31:41,670
吉諾西斯人不信任他們
The Geonosians don't trust them.

985
01:31:41,770 --> 01:31:44,900
話是沒錯，但他確實在這裏
Who can blame them? But he is here, I can assure you.

986
01:31:45,940 --> 01:31:50,240
可惜我們未曾謀面，歐比王
It's a great pity our paths have never crossed before, Obi-Wan.

987
01:31:51,210 --> 01:31:53,580
金魁剛非常讚賞你
Qui-Gon always spoke very highly of you.

988
01:31:58,020 --> 01:32:00,490
真希望他還活在世上
I wish he were still alive.

989
01:32:01,790 --> 01:32:03,910
此刻正需要他的協助
I could use his help right now.

990
01:32:05,220 --> 01:32:07,890
金魁剛不會與你為伍
Qui-Gon Jinn would never join you.

991
01:32:09,460 --> 01:32:12,190
話不要說太滿，年輕絕地武士
Don't be so sure, my young Jedi.

992
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:15,130
他曾經是我的徒弟
You forget that he was once my apprentice...

993
01:32:15,230 --> 01:32:17,400
正如你是他的徒弟
just as you were once his.

994
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:20,200
他知道參議院的腐敗...
He knew all about the corruption in the senate...

995
01:32:20,310 --> 01:32:21,670
但如果他知道實情的話...
but he wouldn't have gone along with it

996
01:32:21,770 --> 01:32:23,610
他就不會坐視不管
if he had learned the truth as I have.

997
01:32:23,780 --> 01:32:24,540
實情？
- The truth?

998
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:26,340
是的，實情
- The truth.

999
01:32:32,790 --> 01:32:34,810
你相不相信，共和國根本...
What if I told you that the Republic was now under the control...

1000
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:37,960
在西斯黑暗大帝的掌握下？
of the dark lord of the Sith?

1001
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:41,290
不可能，絕地武士會知道
No, that's not possible. TheJedi would be aware of it.

1002
01:32:41,730 --> 01:32:45,750
黑暗勢力蒙蔽了他們，朋友
The dark side of the Force has clouded their vision, my friend.

1003
01:32:46,730 --> 01:32:49,500
數百位參議員已經在...
Hundreds of senators are now under the influence...

1004
01:32:49,500 --> 01:32:54,100
黑暗大帝達斯西帝的掌控中
of a Sith lord called Darth Sidious.

1005
01:32:54,910 --> 01:32:56,670
我不相信
I don't believe you.

1006
01:32:56,780 --> 01:32:58,740
貿易聯盟總督...
The viceroy of the Trade Federation...

1007
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:02,780
曾經跟達斯西帝結盟
was once in league with this Darth Sidious...

1008
01:33:03,650 --> 01:33:07,280
但十年前遭黑暗大帝背叛
but he was betrayed ten years ago by the dark lord.

1009
01:33:07,550 --> 01:33:10,490
他向我求助並說出實情
He came to me for help. He told me everything.

1010
01:33:12,360 --> 01:33:15,560
你一定要加入我，歐比王
You must join me, Obi-Wan...

1011
01:33:15,660 --> 01:33:19,720
合力打倒西斯！
and together we will destroy the Sith!

1012
01:33:21,400 --> 01:33:23,660
我絕不會加入你，杜酷
I will never join you, Dooku.

1013
01:33:33,110 --> 01:33:35,980
或許釋放你會有些困難
It may be difficult to secure your release.

1014
01:33:43,790 --> 01:33:45,480
顯然分離主義者...
It's-a clear desa separatists made a pact...

1015
01:33:45,590 --> 01:33:49,560
跟貿易聯盟已達成協定
wesa desa Federation du Trade.

1016
01:33:49,560 --> 01:33:53,960
參議員同事們
Senators, ''dellow felagates'':

1017
01:33:54,070 --> 01:33:58,130
為因應共和國的燃眉之急...
In response to this direct threat to the Republic...

1018
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:00,700
我向本議會提案...
mesa propose that the senate...

1019
01:34:00,810 --> 01:34:03,770
即刻將緊急處分權... 
give immediately emergency powers...

1020
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:08,570
賦予最高議會議長
to the supreme chancellor.

1021
01:34:10,420 --> 01:34:16,320
白卜庭！白卜庭！白卜庭！
Palpatine! Palpatine!

1022
01:34:17,990 --> 01:34:21,080
肅靜！保持肅靜！
Order! We shall have order!

1023
01:34:22,660 --> 01:34:25,990
我心中極為不願意...
It is with great reluctance...

1024
01:34:26,100 --> 01:34:29,400
同意此項授命
that I have agreed to this calling.

1025
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:31,870
我熱愛民主
I love democracy.

1026
01:34:31,970 --> 01:34:33,900
我愛共和國
I love the Republic.

1027
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:37,670
各位今日賦予我的權力...
The power you give me...

1028
01:34:37,780 --> 01:34:40,970
危機消除後我會立刻放棄
I will lay down when this crisis has abated.

1029
01:34:46,350 --> 01:34:50,580
我接受授權後的第一項法令...
And as my first act with this new authority...

1030
01:34:51,260 --> 01:34:55,120
即是為共和國建立強大的軍隊
I will create a grand army of the Republic...

1031
01:34:55,890 --> 01:34:59,300
抵禦日益強大的分離主義威脅
to counter the increasing threats of the separatists.

1032
01:35:00,330 --> 01:35:02,030
建軍已成定案
It is done, then.

1033
01:35:07,410 --> 01:35:08,900
我帶領全數絕地武士
I will take whatJedi we have left

1034
01:35:09,010 --> 01:35:11,030
前往吉諾西斯幫歐比王
and go to Geonosis and help Obi-Wan.

1035
01:35:11,580 --> 01:35:15,140
我將前往卡密諾星察看...
Visit I will the cloners on Kamino...

1036
01:35:16,420 --> 01:35:20,550
共和國所訂製的複製人大軍
and see this army they have created for the Republic.

1037
01:35:40,710 --> 01:35:42,670
看到那些排氣孔嗎？
See those columns of steam straight ahead?

1038
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:44,810
應該是某種廢氣
They're exhaust vents of some type.

1039
01:35:45,610 --> 01:35:47,270
那兒可以降落
That'll do.

1040
01:35:56,990 --> 01:35:59,820
不管發生什麼事都聽我的
Look, whatever happens out there, follow my lead.

1041
01:36:00,290 --> 01:36:02,230
我不想攪入戰局
I'm not interested in getting into a war here.

1042
01:36:02,330 --> 01:36:04,090
身為參議員，說不定我可以...
As a member of the senate...

1043
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:06,560
透過外交途徑解決目前的亂局
maybe I can find a diplomatic solution to this mess.

1044
01:36:07,470 --> 01:36:12,170
不用擔心，我不會再跟你爭辯
Don't worry. I've given up trying to argue with you.

1045
01:36:17,080 --> 01:36:20,170
笨小朋友，如果需要幫忙...
My obtuse little friend, if they had needed our help...

1046
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:22,080
他們自然會開口
they would have asked for it.

1047
01:36:22,250 --> 01:36:25,410
你要多學學人類的行為模式
You obviously have a great deal to learn about human behavior.

1048
01:36:51,410 --> 01:36:54,400
身為技工，你想太多了
For a mechanic, you seem to do an excessive amount of thinking.

1049
01:36:56,550 --> 01:36:59,070
我的專長程式正是瞭解人類！
I am programmed to understand humans!

1050
01:37:02,860 --> 01:37:07,450
「什麼意思？」意思是我是老大
''What does that mean?'' That means I am in charge here!

1051
01:37:07,630 --> 01:37:12,790
你做什麼？外面狀況不明 難道你都沒有感覺嗎？
Where are you going now? You don't know what's out there. Have you no sense at all?

1052
01:37:12,870 --> 01:37:14,230
白癡！
Idiot!

1053
01:37:16,940 --> 01:37:18,430
請等一下
Please wait.

1054
01:37:19,770 --> 01:37:21,470
你知不知道你要去哪裏？
Do you know where you're going?

1055
01:37:33,950 --> 01:37:34,920
等一下
Wait.

1056
01:37:44,160 --> 01:37:46,130
啊，天啊...噢！

1057
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:53,230
噢，老天啊！
Oh, my goodness!

1058
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:54,900
誰來幫我關機！
Shut me down!

1059
01:38:55,830 --> 01:38:58,000
機器正在製造機器
Machines making machines.

1060
01:38:58,870 --> 01:38:59,600
真變態
How perverse!

1061
01:39:00,910 --> 01:39:02,000
慢點，R2！
Calm down, R2!

1062
01:39:02,510 --> 01:39:04,200
我差點兒摔下去
I almost fell.

1063
01:39:04,680 --> 01:39:06,340
等一下會有機會，所以...
You'll get your chance--

1064
01:39:08,850 --> 01:39:10,180
我變成廢鐵了
I'm scrap.

1065
01:39:11,680 --> 01:39:14,120
惡夢一場！
It's a nightmare!

1066
01:39:15,890 --> 01:39:17,410
我要回家！
I want to go home!

1067
01:39:19,660 --> 01:39:21,130
我有做錯什麼事嗎？
What did I do to deserve this?

1068
01:40:00,830 --> 01:40:03,270
不曉得可憐的R2怎麼樣了？
I wonder what happened to poor little R2.

1069
01:40:03,570 --> 01:40:05,370
他老是惹麻煩
He's always getting himself into trouble.

1070
01:40:07,370 --> 01:40:08,460
哦，不要！
Oh, no!

1071
01:40:23,920 --> 01:40:25,390
我都弄糊塗了
I'm so confused.

1072
01:42:21,410 --> 01:42:25,440
又來了，歐比王這次會殺了我
Not again! Obi-Wan's gonna kill me.

1073
01:42:34,420 --> 01:42:37,610
別動，絕地武士！把他們帶走
Don't move,Jedi! Take him away.

1074
01:42:56,840 --> 01:42:58,310
不要怕
Don't be afraid.

1075
01:43:00,180 --> 01:43:01,910
我不怕死
I'm not afraid to die.

1076
01:43:06,890 --> 01:43:08,380
從你進到我的生命開始...
I've been dying a little bit each day

1077
01:43:08,490 --> 01:43:10,450
我就一天天逐漸枯萎
since you came back into my life.

1078
01:43:12,620 --> 01:43:14,320
你說這話是什麼意思？
What are you talking about?

1079
01:43:16,260 --> 01:43:17,420
我愛你
I love you.

1080
01:43:22,300 --> 01:43:23,630
你愛我？
You love me?

1081
01:43:28,740 --> 01:43:31,940
我以為我們決定不能相愛
I thought we had decided not to fall in love...

1082
01:43:34,150 --> 01:43:36,480
因為我們會被迫活在謊言中
that we would be forced to live a lie...

1083
01:43:37,720 --> 01:43:40,180
因為會摧毀我們的生活
and that it would destroy our lives.

1084
01:43:41,450 --> 01:43:44,320
反正我們的生活終歸會被摧毀
I think our lives are about to be destroyed anyway.

1085
01:43:48,760 --> 01:43:54,530
我真的深深的愛著你
I truly... deeply love you...

1086
01:43:55,800 --> 01:43:58,330
在我們死前，我要你知道
and before we die, I want you to know.

1087
01:44:55,460 --> 01:44:57,760
我正懷疑你是否收到我的訊息
I was beginning to wonder if you'd got my message.

1088
01:44:57,930 --> 01:45:01,190
我按照你的吩咐轉傳至科羅森
I retransmitted it just as you had requested, Master.

1089
01:45:03,400 --> 01:45:05,230
然後決定前來救你
Then we decided to come and rescue you.

1090
01:45:06,640 --> 01:45:07,700
幹得好
Good job.

1091
01:45:19,580 --> 01:45:23,080
稍安勿躁，稍安勿躁
Settle down. Settle down.

1092
01:45:27,390 --> 01:45:30,790
開始行刑
Let the executions begin.

1093
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:06,360
我有個很壞的預感
I've got a bad feeling about this.

1094
01:46:32,160 --> 01:46:33,250
放輕鬆，專注心思
-Just relax. Concentrate.

1095
01:46:33,530 --> 01:46:34,580
帕米怎麼辦？
- What about Padme?

1096
01:46:34,730 --> 01:46:36,390
看來她已經脫身了
She seems to be on top of things.

1097
01:47:39,890 --> 01:47:43,590
她犯規！射她，或想個辦法！
She can't do that! Shoot her... or something!

1098
01:49:02,970 --> 01:49:03,800
跳！
Jump!

1099
01:49:28,070 --> 01:49:31,500
狀況不對勁了！強格！
This isn't how it's supposed to be!

1100
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:33,230
把她幹掉！
Jango! Finish her off!

1101
01:49:33,740 --> 01:49:36,970
耐心，總督，她死定了
Patience, Viceroy, patience. She will die.

1102
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:08,870
雲杜大師...
Master Windu.

1103
01:50:09,310 --> 01:50:11,330
歡迎你也加入
How pleasant of you to join us.

1104
01:50:11,710 --> 01:50:13,140
鬧劇該收場了
This party's over.

1105
01:50:27,290 --> 01:50:31,790
勇敢...但愚蠢，老朋友
Brave... but foolish, my old Jedi friend.

1106
01:50:32,200 --> 01:50:33,690
你們人真是少得可憐
You're impossibly outnumbered.

1107
01:50:33,870 --> 01:50:36,200
我可不這麼認為
I don't think so.

1108
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:37,700
走著瞧
We'll see.

1109
01:51:16,240 --> 01:51:19,040
腿不能動，我需要保養了
My legs aren't moving. I must need maintenance.

1110
01:51:58,620 --> 01:52:01,240
怎麼這麼吵？打仗！
What's all this noise? A battle!

1111
01:52:01,420 --> 01:52:03,690
搞錯了！我的內建程式是禮賓
There's been some terrible mistake!I'm programmed for etiquette,

1112
01:52:03,690 --> 01:52:06,420
不是搞破壞！
not destruction!

1113
01:53:34,250 --> 01:53:36,150
去死，絕地狗雜種！
Die,Jedi dogs!

1114
01:53:36,250 --> 01:53:37,680
噢！我在說什麼？
Oh! What did I say?

1115
01:53:46,990 --> 01:53:50,020
天啊，真是抱歉到了極點
Oh, dear. I'm terribly sorry about all this.

1116
01:53:55,870 --> 01:53:58,600
抱歉，我被絆住了，起不來
Excuse me. I'm trapped. I can't get up.

1117
01:54:12,680 --> 01:54:14,310
你說這叫...外交解決途徑？
- You call this a diplomatic solution?

1118
01:54:14,420 --> 01:54:16,580
不...這叫激烈的爭辯
- No, I call it aggressive negotiations.

1119
01:54:22,090 --> 01:54:23,690
收到，收到
- Uh-oh. - Roger, roger.

1120
01:54:42,450 --> 01:54:44,140
R2，你在這做什麼？
R2, what are you doing here?

1121
01:54:47,620 --> 01:54:48,640
你在做什麼？
What are you doing?

1122
01:54:49,020 --> 01:54:53,320
住手！你會扯斷...我的脖子！
Stop that! You're going to strain something. My neck!

1123
01:54:55,190 --> 01:54:56,820
噢，你要帶我去哪裏？
Now where are you taking me?

1124
01:54:56,930 --> 01:54:58,620
不要拖那麼用力
This is such a drag!

1125
01:55:03,940 --> 01:55:05,700
我真是丈二金剛摸不著頭緒
I'm quite beside myself.

1126
01:55:14,580 --> 01:55:16,010
R2，拜託小心點
R2, please be careful!

1127
01:55:16,110 --> 01:55:17,910
我快短路了
You're singeing my circuits!

1128
01:55:19,120 --> 01:55:21,580
好！頭有接正嗎？
Yes, but is my head on straight?

1129
01:55:44,280 --> 01:55:45,970
雲杜大師...
Master Windu...

1130
01:55:46,310 --> 01:55:48,300
果然是一代豪俠
you have fought gallantly...

1131
01:55:49,480 --> 01:55:53,750
該當名留絕地聖殿
worthy of recognition in the archives of theJedi order.

1132
01:55:55,650 --> 01:56:00,190
現在...你的時候到了
Now... it is finished.

1133
01:56:00,490 --> 01:56:05,090
投降...我還可以饒你一命
Surrender... and your lives will be spared.

1134
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:09,260
我們不是用來交換條件的人質
We will not be hostages to be bartered, Dooku!

1135
01:56:09,570 --> 01:56:13,760
既然如此...抱歉啦，老朋友
Then... I'm sorry, old friend.

1136
01:56:25,180 --> 01:56:25,810
看！
Look!

1137
01:56:37,530 --> 01:56:41,790
生存者四周形成了個包圍陣地
Around the survivors a perimeter create.

1138
01:57:38,290 --> 01:57:41,380
我作了個非常奇怪的夢
I've had the most peculiar dream!

1139
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:53,970
萬一杜酷逃走...
If Dooku escapes...

1140
01:57:54,340 --> 01:57:57,830
他會號召更多星系叛變
rally more systems to his cause he will.

1141
01:58:02,580 --> 01:58:03,570
抓好！
Hold on!

1142
01:58:08,820 --> 01:58:10,680
瞄準能源供應器正上方！
Aim right above the fuel cells!

1143
01:58:17,630 --> 01:58:19,720
非常犀利，小徒弟
Good call, my young Padawan.

1144
01:58:33,310 --> 01:58:35,840
絕地武士召集了一支大軍
TheJedi have amassed a huge army.

1145
01:58:36,110 --> 01:58:38,170
怎麼可能
That doesn't seem possible.

1146
01:58:38,280 --> 01:58:40,750
這麼短的時間怎麼建軍？
How could theJedi come up with an army so quickly?

1147
01:58:40,850 --> 01:58:44,880
全部機器人都送上戰場
We must send all available droids into battle.

1148
01:58:44,990 --> 01:58:46,390
敵軍排山倒海而來
There are too many.

1149
01:58:47,090 --> 01:58:50,080
所有通訊都受到干擾不通
Our communications have been jammed.

1150
01:58:58,070 --> 01:59:01,230
飛行員，降落在集合區！
Pilot, land in that assembly area!

1151
01:59:01,370 --> 01:59:02,630
是的，長官
Yes, sir.

1152
01:59:10,780 --> 01:59:12,150
長官，我有五支突襲隊...
Sir...I have five special commando units

1153
01:59:12,150 --> 01:59:14,810
等待您下令，長官
awaiting your orders, sir.

1154
01:59:16,190 --> 01:59:19,250
帶我到前進指揮中心
To the forward command center take me.

1155
01:59:42,550 --> 01:59:45,140
攻擊聯盟戰艦，快！
Attack those Federation starships, quickly!

1156
01:59:56,160 --> 01:59:59,860
尤達大師，前線部隊不斷挺進
Master Yoda, all forward positions are advancing.

1157
02:00:00,430 --> 02:00:04,160
很好，非常好
Very good. Very good.

1158
02:00:32,330 --> 02:00:34,420
戰況越來越不利
This is not looking good at all!

1159
02:00:35,900 --> 02:00:39,340
我方戰艦要退回太空中
We must get the starships back into space.

1160
02:00:42,070 --> 02:00:45,940
非下令撤退不可
We have to order a retreat.

1161
02:00:46,440 --> 02:00:48,240
我師父不會輕鬆放過...
My master will never allow the Republic...

1162
02:00:48,350 --> 02:00:50,840
共和國這次的叛變行動
to get away with this treachery.

1163
02:00:50,950 --> 02:00:54,210
我要讓戰士們躲進地下墓穴
I'm sending my warriors to hide in the catacombs.

1164
02:00:54,650 --> 02:00:56,120
終極武器設計圖...
TheJedi must not find

1165
02:00:56,220 --> 02:00:58,650
絕不能讓絕地武士發現
our designs for the ultimate weapon.

1166
02:01:00,620 --> 02:01:06,060
計劃若曝光，我們就完了
If they find out what we are planning to build, we're doomed.

1167
02:01:09,130 --> 02:01:11,760
我帶設計圖到科羅森去
I will take the designs with me to Coruscant.

1168
02:01:12,640 --> 02:01:15,660
跟我師父在一起安全多了
They will be much safer there with my master.

1169
02:02:10,330 --> 02:02:14,730
將火力集中在最近的戰艦
Concentrate all your fire on the nearest starship.

1170
02:02:15,430 --> 02:02:16,400
是的，長官
Yes, sir.

1171
02:02:17,570 --> 02:02:20,260
所有象限儀調至5-1-5區
Move all quadrants to sector 51 5.

1172
02:03:00,910 --> 02:03:01,880
看那邊！
Look over there!

1173
02:03:05,450 --> 02:03:07,710
是杜酷，把他打下來！
It's Dooku! Shoot him down!

1174
02:03:08,450 --> 02:03:09,750
沒有飛彈了，長官
We're out of rockets, sir.

1175
02:03:09,890 --> 02:03:10,790
跟著他！
- Follow him!

1176
02:03:10,890 --> 02:03:12,790
我們需要援兵！
- We're gonna need some help!

1177
02:03:12,890 --> 02:03:14,320
沒有時間！
There isn't time!

1178
02:03:14,430 --> 02:03:16,520
安納金和我可以應付
Anakin and I can handle this!

1179
02:03:36,310 --> 02:03:37,340
帕米！

1180
02:03:40,780 --> 02:03:41,880
降落！
Put the ship down!

1181
02:03:41,990 --> 02:03:42,950
安納金！
Anakin

1182
02:03:43,120 --> 02:03:44,950
大敵當前怎能兒女情長！
Don't let your personal feelings get in the way!

1183
02:03:45,720 --> 02:03:46,850
跟緊那輛飛行機車！
Follow that speeder!

1184
02:03:52,930 --> 02:03:53,590
降下去！
- Lower the ship!

1185
02:03:53,700 --> 02:03:55,100
我一個人對付不了杜酷！
- I can't take Dooku alone!

1186
02:03:55,200 --> 02:03:56,290
我需要你幫忙
I need you! If we catch him,

1187
02:03:56,400 --> 02:03:59,030
逮到他，戰爭立刻就結束了！
we can end this war right now!

1188
02:03:59,140 --> 02:04:00,360
我們有要務在身！
- We have a job to do!

1189
02:04:00,470 --> 02:04:01,960
我管不了那麼多！降落！
- I don't care! Put the ship down!

1190
02:04:02,110 --> 02:04:04,440
你會被逐出絕地武士行列！
You will be expelled from theJedi order!

1191
02:04:04,540 --> 02:04:05,670
我不能丟下她
- I can't leave her!

1192
02:04:05,810 --> 02:04:07,540
冷靜想想
- Come to your senses!

1193
02:04:07,640 --> 02:04:10,440
如果帕米是你，她會怎麼做
What do you think Padme would do were she in your position?

1194
02:04:14,950 --> 02:04:16,650
她會盡她應盡的義務
She would do her duty.

1195
02:04:25,960 --> 02:04:28,020
機器人軍隊全面撤退了
The droid army is in full retreat.

1196
02:04:28,130 --> 02:04:29,860
很好，司令官
Well done, Commander.

1197
02:04:29,970 --> 02:04:31,370
找艘太空船給我
Bring me a ship.

1198
02:04:58,460 --> 02:04:59,950
該為你今天殺害的...
You're gonna pay for all theJedi

1199
02:05:00,060 --> 02:05:01,500
絕地武士償命了，杜酷
that you killed today, Dooku.

1200
02:05:01,770 --> 02:05:03,490
一起攻擊，你慢慢從...
We'll take him together.

1201
02:05:03,600 --> 02:05:05,400
不，我現在就殺了他！ 不，安納金！不！
- I'm taking him now! - No, Anakin! No!

1202
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:06,830
不要！
No!

1203
02:05:13,380 --> 02:05:16,900
看到了吧，我的力量遠超過你
As you see, myJedi powers are far beyond yours.

1204
02:05:17,010 --> 02:05:19,410
還不退下？
Now... back down.

1205
02:05:24,860 --> 02:05:26,350
礙難照辦
I don't think so.

1206
02:05:39,270 --> 02:05:42,260
肯諾比大師，你真叫我失望
Master Kenobi, you disappoint me.

1207
02:05:42,410 --> 02:05:45,380
枉費尤達那麼推崇你
Yoda holds you in such high esteem.

1208
02:05:47,880 --> 02:05:50,310
本事不過如此
Surely you can do better.

1209
02:06:01,360 --> 02:06:02,450
你還好吧？
Are you all right?

1210
02:06:03,260 --> 02:06:04,520
還好
Uh-huh.

1211
02:06:05,930 --> 02:06:07,920
趕快回前進指揮中心去
We'd better get back to the forward command center.

1212
02:06:08,070 --> 02:06:09,690
不，不
No.

1213
02:06:10,200 --> 02:06:11,430
集結你所有的部隊
Gather what troops you can.

1214
02:06:11,540 --> 02:06:13,200
我們得趕去那座停機中心
We've got to get to that hangar.

1215
02:06:13,300 --> 02:06:15,360
找艘運輸工具，快！
Get a transport. Hurry!

1216
02:06:15,470 --> 02:06:16,560
立刻照辦
Right away.

1217
02:06:42,400 --> 02:06:43,590
很勇敢哦，小男孩
Brave of you, boy.

1218
02:06:45,240 --> 02:06:47,100
但，我以為你學聰明了
But I would have thought you had learned your lesson.

1219
02:06:47,470 --> 02:06:48,800
我一向學得比較慢
I am a slow learner.

1220
02:06:48,940 --> 02:06:49,910
安納金！
Anakin

1221
02:07:51,600 --> 02:07:53,000
尤達大師
Master Yoda.

1222
02:07:53,500 --> 02:07:55,900
杜酷伯爵
Count Dooku.

1223
02:07:56,410 --> 02:07:59,860
這是你最後一次干涉我們的事
You have interfered with our affairs for the last time.

1224
02:08:30,810 --> 02:08:33,870
你的力量變強了，杜酷
Powerful you have become, Dooku.

1225
02:08:34,210 --> 02:08:37,480
我感覺到你體內的黑暗勢力
The dark side I sense in you.

1226
02:08:37,850 --> 02:08:40,650
我比任何絕地武士都強
I've become more powerful than anyJedi.

1227
02:08:42,220 --> 02:08:43,190
即使是你
Even you.

1228
02:08:58,300 --> 02:09:01,570
你該學的還多著呢
Much to learn you still have.

1229
02:09:02,310 --> 02:09:04,870
顯然，我們無法用...
It is obvious that this contest cannot be decided...

1230
02:09:04,980 --> 02:09:07,470
對原力的見解分高下
by our knowledge of the Force...

1231
02:09:09,180 --> 02:09:11,910
那只好用劍術決勝負了
but by our skills with a lightsaber.

1232
02:09:53,390 --> 02:09:56,880
技術還不錯，老徒弟
Fought well you have, my old Padawan.

1233
02:09:57,030 --> 02:09:58,790
才剛開始呢
This is just the beginning.

1234
02:12:31,820 --> 02:12:34,580
原力與我們同在，西帝大師
The Force is with us, Master Sidious.

1235
02:12:34,680 --> 02:12:37,150
歡迎歸來，提拉諾斯大公
Welcome home, Lord Tyranus.

1236
02:12:39,220 --> 02:12:41,160
做得非常好
You have done well.

1237
02:12:42,030 --> 02:12:44,150
我有個好消息，大帝
I have good news for you, my lord.

1238
02:12:45,730 --> 02:12:47,290
戰爭已經開始了
- The war has begun. - Excellent.

1239
02:12:47,400 --> 02:12:52,230
完美，一切按照計劃進行
Everything is going as planned.

1240
02:13:02,110 --> 02:13:03,940
你相信杜酷伯爵說的話嗎？
Do you believe what Count Dooku said

1241
02:13:04,050 --> 02:13:06,450
他說西帝已經掌控了參議院
about Sidious controlling the senate?

1242
02:13:06,550 --> 02:13:08,180
我總感覺不對勁
It doesn't feel right.

1243
02:13:08,750 --> 02:13:11,810
杜酷已經加入黑暗勢力
Joined the dark side Dooku has.

1244
02:13:13,460 --> 02:13:14,860
謊言，欺騙...
Lies, deceit...

1245
02:13:15,360 --> 02:13:19,060
製造猜忌是他的拿手好戲
creating mistrust are his ways now.

1246
02:13:19,160 --> 02:13:20,320
話雖如此...
Nevertheless..

1247
02:13:20,500 --> 02:13:23,300
我們最好還是多留意參議院
I feel we should keep a closer eye on the senate.

1248
02:13:23,400 --> 02:13:25,870
我同意
I agree.

1249
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:28,470
你徒弟呢？
Where is your apprentice?

1250
02:13:29,070 --> 02:13:32,770
護送艾米達拉議員回那卜星
On his way to Naboo, escorting Senator Amidala home.

1251
02:13:34,280 --> 02:13:37,800
沒有複製人，我們真的贏不了
I have to admit that without the clones, it would not have been a victory.

1252
02:13:37,910 --> 02:13:39,380
贏？
Victory?

1253
02:13:41,050 --> 02:13:43,590
你說贏嗎，歐比王大師？
Victory, you say?Master Obi-Wan,

1254
02:13:43,590 --> 02:13:47,420
這不是勝利
not victory.

1255
02:13:48,630 --> 02:13:52,250
黑暗勢力的裹屍布已被掀開
The shroud of the dark side has fallen.

1256
02:13:53,460 --> 02:13:57,560
複製人大戰才剛開始呢
Begun the Clone War has.
