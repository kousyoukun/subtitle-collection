1
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:58,552
"Orson, come into the light."

2
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:02,127
Never stand in the shadows.

3
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:04,457
You were made for the light.

4
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,498
Always remember that.

5
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:13,503
"Now, turn around"
and make a wish. Go on.

6
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:16,809
You must blow out your candles.

7
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:28,082
"One breath, now."

8
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:30,519
That's all you get.
One chance.

9
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:33,619
Are you ready?

10
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:37,760
Now.

11
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:42,495
He came to the town
of magic and dreams...

12
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:45,503
a flashing star blazing
through the firmament of illusion.

13
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:49,234
"He was 24 years old,"
and his name was orson welles.

14
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,275
"Sound the trumpets,"
"unfurl the banners, hollywood."

15
00:01:51,377 --> 00:01:53,368
The boy wonder has arrived.

16
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:55,447
"May 6, 1915."

17
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:59,211
The prodigy makes his debut on
"the world stage in kenosha, wisconsin."

18
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:03,186
"May 7. he speaks his first words,"
"and they are, "i am a genius."

19
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:06,292
Subsequent developments
confirm this opinion.

20
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:11,294
"At 18 he goes to new york,"
the cauldron of the world.

21
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:14,662
"Watch out, cauldron."
Orson has arrived.

22
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:16,496
Like hannibal over the alps...

23
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:21,131
the boy genius invades the great white
way with production after production.

24
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,276
And then he takes to the airwaves...

25
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:28,210
step two in his plan
for global domination.

26
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:32,409
This is the end now.
They're running toward the east river

27
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:36,285
"thousands of them,"
dropping in like rats.

28
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:38,213
The war of the worlds broadcast...

29
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,224
sends this nation into a frenzy.

30
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,261
"Yes, the boy wonder has fooled us all."

31
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,297
We had no idea
any of this was happening.

32
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,300
I feel just horrible.

33
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:51,233
Mr. Welles~ mr. Welles~

34
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:57,442
how long can it possibly be
before the sunny land of dreams.

35
00:02:57,544 --> 00:03:01,446
Tries to harness the combustible power
of this showman extraordinaire?

36
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:05,848
The winner in the welles derby is
"george schaefer, head of rko pictures."

37
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:09,353
With a contract unimaginable
before the days of orson...

38
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:12,890
"mr. Schaefer captures the whirlwind,"
snares the beast.

39
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:17,857
Eyebrows raise and jaws drop
when terms of the deal come forth.

40
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:21,331
"The boy wonder can write, direct"
and star in his own projects.

41
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:24,335
The studio?
"Well, they just pay the bills."

42
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:28,331
So cometh orson.

43
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:31,739
He met the biggest of the big
and charmed his way through the town.

44
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:35,648
From the brown derby
to the copacabana.

45
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,376
From louella parsons to hedda hopper...

46
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:39,849
those rival maidens
of hollywood gossip.

47
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:42,888
"And so today, almost a year"
after his arrival...

48
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:45,719
we leave the boy wonder
still hard at work...

49
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:48,550
developing his much-anticipated
first feature.

50
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:50,652
"We're waiting, orson."

51
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,492
Genius?

52
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:53,622
Who does that cocksucker
think he is?

53
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:57,793
"Word is glory boy's all finished,"
mr. Mayer. Can't come up with a movie.

54
00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:01,930
They're laying bets at rko this deal
ends up with him never doing a picture.

55
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:04,709
Back to new york he goes.

56
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:06,802
"After rko boots him,"
let's pick him up cheap.

57
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:09,574
Have him do that war of the worlds crap
as a feature.

58
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:13,880
It's money in the bank for us
"and, bingo, no more genius."

59
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:18,882
"This is hollywood, junior."
What did you expect?

60
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:22,621
And you keep coming up
with the same elitist crap.

61
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,423
"Enough, mank."

62
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:26,862
God~ i hear this from schaefer
and everyone else.

63
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:28,524
I don't need to hear it from you.

64
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:31,398
"Heart of darkness,"
million-dollar budget.

65
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:34,499
No one wants to see that
"that's nonsense, and you know it."

66
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:37,701
What do you think movies are about?
"Don't start this, please."

67
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:40,404
I'm interested.
What do you think movies are about?

68
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:43,481
Life's rich pageant.

69
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,575
"Life's rich pageant, my ass."

70
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,744
People are sick to death of life.

71
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:50,822
They want make-believe.

72
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:56,385
"They want tarzan and jane,"
not tristan and isolde.

73
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,430
You know what they want?

74
00:04:58,531 --> 00:04:59,657
Magic.

75
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:03,394
You know what your job is in hollywood?
Put butts in seats.

76
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:09,540
It's all about selling popcorn
and pepsi-colas.

77
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,405
Not for me it isn't.

78
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:13,739
Then you're about to become
the youngest never-was...

79
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:15,370
in the history of hollywood.

80
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:17,745
Better than the oldest has been.
Is it?

81
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:27,357
What are we going to write?
I don't know. You tell me.

82
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:28,585
You're the boy wonder.

83
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,556
Well?

84
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,798
Jesus christ. Come on.

85
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,065
The old man
doesn't cotton to lateness.

86
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,438
"Good evening, mr. Hearst."

87
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:47,473
My name is orson welles.

88
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,864
"So we set traps everywhere, right?"

89
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:11,528
"And every morning,"
the traps would be sprung...

90
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:13,730
but there would be no mice.

91
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,465
What?
So one night...

92
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:17,807
i noticed pops here
getting out of bed...

93
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,708
i've got it.
"'Sigmund freud, life and times."

94
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:24,010
That's a great idea. Just got
your ass kicked on joseph conrad

95
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:26,347
and now it's the id
and the superego.

96
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:28,750
I'll be goddamned if he
isn't springing the traps...

97
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,356
and leaving cheese
for the goddamn mice.

98
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,020
"You. You and that guy disney,"
in love with the damn rats.

99
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:38,687
"Okay, then, manolete."

100
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:40,355
Who?

101
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:43,367
"Manolete,"
the great spanish bullfighter.

102
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:45,801
Imagine clark here
in a glittering suit of lights...

103
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:47,872
on the andalusian plains.

104
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:50,532
Mr. Welles
is attempting semaphore.

105
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,372
"Bullfighting, miss davies."

106
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:55,513
Is dear mank your bull?

107
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:59,914
"My factotum,"
"comrade-in-arms, ally."

108
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:00,850
"Flunky, pimp."

109
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:02,713
Writer.
That too.

110
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:05,449
You fight many bulls in new york?

111
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:07,389
"No, when i was a tender lad..."

112
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:11,395
my father and i made a tour
of the grand boulevards of europe.

113
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:12,862
When we were in spain...

114
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:15,490
i had the good fortune
to sit at the knee of manolete...

115
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:18,570
the greatest bullfighter
of the age.

116
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:21,104
'What is the matador's
greatest enemy?" he asked me.

117
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:23,175
"Of course, i naively responded,"
"the bull."

118
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:25,739
"No, the bull"
is merely his adversary.

119
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:28,678
His greatest enemy
is his own fear.

120
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:32,410
"You see, to kill the bull,"
one must first learn to think like him."

121
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:37,612
"Having said that, he strode forth"
gallantly into the ring.

122
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:40,618
"He flourished, flourished again."
Suddenly the bull charged.

123
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:43,689
"It thundered towards him,"
its calamitous hooves...

124
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,060
shaking the earth
beneath manolete's feet...

125
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:48,929
"and as it was almost upon him,"
he stepped to the side...

126
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:50,935
flourished again and struck.

127
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:54,596
And when the dust cleared...

128
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:58,136
the sword was gone...

129
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:00,769
vanished in the bloody eye
of the beast.

130
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:06,751
That is barbaric.

131
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:10,622
Of all man's sadism...

132
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:14,124
none is more depraved
than his cruelty to animals.

133
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:21,762
"In spain, sir, the cruelty would be"
in denying the beast a fighting end

134
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:24,666
"as in your magnificent zoo,"
for instance.

135
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,507
"And who are you, sir?"
"Orson welles, sir."

136
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:33,943
"Ah, the actor."

137
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,610
And director.
I wish you luck.

138
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:43,518
"In hollywood, the bull"
and the matador are both slaughtered.

139
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:50,024
Why the crack about the zoo?
Why not just let it lie?

140
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:52,130
Because he's a hypocrite.
So what?

141
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:54,699
I like to come here.
I want to be asked back.

142
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:56,631
Why? You have no place here.

143
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:58,704
Because marion's my friend.

144
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:01,534
Did you hear what he said to me?

145
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,676
Preaching against man's cruelty
"to animals. I mean, come on~"

146
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:06,608
come here.
I want to show you something.

147
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:16,782
The old man owns the biggest
publishing empire in the world.

148
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:20,017
"When you have all that,"
you can preach whatever you want.

149
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:22,119
Like appeasing hitler.

150
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:26,254
A lot of people agree with him.
He tells them what they want to hear.

151
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,658
As if that was
something to be proud of.

152
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:30,063
Can't smoke here.

153
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:31,969
Of course.

154
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:33,971
How could i forget?

155
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:36,040
"No smoking, no drinking..."

156
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:38,143
no moral vices whatsoever.

157
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:42,046
I suppose keeping an alcoholic mistress
half your age...

158
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:43,672
is considered a virtue here.

159
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,681
The old man has his own way
of doing things.

160
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:49,916
I'll say.

161
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:02,692
"Oh, god,"
these parties are awful.

162
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:05,966
"You need to get out of here,"
rapunzel.

163
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:08,040
That's why he has the parties.

164
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,709
He says it's like
bringing the world to me.

165
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:17,680
But it's not so bad here. What girl
doesn't want to live in a castle?

166
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:22,084
Mr. Welles certainly is
"a caution, isn't he?"

167
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:26,056
"And attractive,"
in a hammy sort of way.

168
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,956
Listen. Why don't you come down
and stay with us for a few days?

169
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:32,997
Just tell the old man...

170
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,759
he needs me here.

171
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:43,300
How big is this monstrosity?
The estate?

172
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,009
Half the size of rhode island.
You're kidding.

173
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:49,706
No. It's the place god
would have built if he'd had the money.

174
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,749
Hello.
Manky.

175
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:54,982
Will you dance with me?

176
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:57,647
I'll dance with you.
"Oh, good. Thank you."

177
00:10:57,757 --> 00:11:00,055
You've been naughty.
Can you smell it?

178
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:03,650
"So, are you ever"
gonna do a picture?

179
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:05,321
"Not you too, carole."

180
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:09,094
"It's gonna be fine, orson."
You're gonna do just great.

181
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:13,096
You're just scared.

182
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,066
Am i?

183
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:21,679
"And what am i scared of, carole?"

184
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:22,814
Of being found out.

185
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,783
Of not being a genius.

186
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:29,649
"Goddamn it, pops."
You gotta do something.

187
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:31,950
There's no need for such language.
Goddamn it.

188
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:38,925
You missed the beat.

189
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:19,462
I've got it.
I know what we're going to do.

190
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:22,534
Imagine a man
who has shaped his time.

191
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:25,803
A titanic figure
of limitless ambition.

192
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:27,805
A man with an empire
at his feet...

193
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:29,898
controlling the perceptions
of everyone beneath him.

194
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,901
A modern feudal lord.

195
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,448
"The great american biography,"
a journey into the heart of the beast.

196
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:40,041
"Oh, no."
Don't you see it?

197
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:42,120
He's spent a lifetime
making entertainment...

198
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:44,916
"out of other people's lives,"
and now we turn the tables on him.

199
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:47,116
It's perfect.
It's perfectly suicidal.

200
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:49,160
How long have i been looking
for the answer...

201
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:51,229
when all this time it's been
right here under my nose?

202
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:53,263
"Every day in the newspapers,"
on the radio...

203
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:55,265
waiting for us
in that ridiculous castle~

204
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:56,493
"orson, stop."

205
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,430
I've talked to arnie.
He says it's all right.

206
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:02,473
He says he's a public figure who sought
"out that publicity, so legally..."

207
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:04,803
"listen to me, you child."

208
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:07,276
He doesn't worry about legalities.
Do you know why?

209
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:10,907
Because he has more power than you
could even begin to imagine.

210
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,849
- All the more reason to do it~
because he insulted you at a party?

211
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:17,411
Because he's a hypocrite.
Because he's a political turncoat.

212
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:19,285
He claims to care
about the common man...

213
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,222
when nothing could be
further from the truth.

214
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:24,057
He's a journalist.
He owns hollywood.

215
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:26,893
We're the shit on his shoes.

216
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,830
You better go back to broadway.
I expected more from you.

217
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:32,426
"Yeah, me too,"
but i got used to it.

218
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:36,029
"How does that feel,"
getting used to it?

219
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:38,910
"How does that feel, going up"
to the palace and amusing the lords

220
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:42,538
and ladies with the same stories
they've heard a hundred times before?

221
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:46,140
How does it feel being the ugly monkey
they keep around to amuse themselves?

222
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:50,016
"I remember a man who wrote, a writer who"
dazzled me with his wit and insight

223
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:52,287
who hasn't had a credit
in four years...

224
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:55,384
because he's been so busy
wasting himself amusing his keepers...

225
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:58,123
because he's a sycophant who's been
thrown out of every hollywood studio

226
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:00,198
and no one will hire him
because he's a drunk.

227
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:02,197
"I'm sorry, mank."
You must be thirsty.

228
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:05,634
Here. Have another. I wouldn't want
to stand in the way of progress.

229
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:08,998
Do you honestly expect me
to believe you care about me?

230
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:11,473
You don't give a fuck
about anyone but yourself.

231
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:15,205
Hearst was right about you.
You're just another goddamn actor.

232
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:22,017
I'm sorry.

233
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:24,884
"Orson, i don't have it"
in me anymore.

234
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:28,619
"I used to have dreams too,"
but that's over now.

235
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,259
It doesn't have to be.

236
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:33,490
No studio would hire me.
I'll hire you.

237
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:36,066
I just know this is the story.
Everything in my life...

238
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:38,669
"all the potential, all the promise"
has led to this moment...

239
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:40,232
to you and me.

240
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:44,103
"Orson, he will destroy us."

241
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:48,613
"Take my hand, mank."

242
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,407
We'll make history.

243
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:56,146
We'll scorch the earth.
We will astonish them all.

244
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:02,085
Notes for a novel.
My great modern tragedy.

245
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:05,960
On hearst.
You're joking.

246
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:09,067
I guess great minds think alike.

247
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:12,329
You've never told me about this before.
I haven't looked at it in ten years.

248
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:15,032
"More importantly,"
i never showed it to anyone else

249
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,404
you know why?
Because i wanna go living

250
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,307
time to let go
"of that ambition, old boy."

251
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:28,084
"Rosebud."

252
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:31,181
What?

253
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:35,125
"Marion told carole lombard...

254
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:39,186
that the old man's pet name for it
is 'rosebud."'

255
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:45,469
"My god, mank. He has a pet name"
for her pussy and you never told me?

256
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:49,735
"Orson, you can't do a picture"
where you have a pet name for a pussy.

257
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:53,408
"In fact, you can't do a picture"
where you have any name for a pussy.

258
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:55,672
"Oh, i think we can find a way."

259
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,483
"You just don't get it, do you?"

260
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,110
Why do you think
i scrapped all this stuff?

261
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:04,347
You can't scrap this.
It's too good. This is gold.

262
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,482
Gold. You want gold?
I'll give you some gold.

263
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:10,527
This is a story you won't find
written down in there or anywhere else.

264
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:12,620
It's 1924 or so...

265
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:18,169
and hearst is giving a birthday party
for an old hollywood producer...

266
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,498
called thomas ince...

267
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,537
on his yacht.

268
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:27,545
And all the usuals are there...
"charlie chaplin, louella, etcetera."

269
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:30,013
And at this time
marion was screwing everyone...

270
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:32,242
and so she slips off
with chaplin.

271
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:35,014
Hearst sees this.

272
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:38,316
He goes absolutely nuts.

273
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:40,585
He's there on the deck
with a revolver...

274
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,661
just blasting away
like tom mix...

275
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:47,197
and he hits thomas ince
"right in the chest, and he is dead."

276
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:48,596
Dead.

277
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:52,293
The empire snaps into action.

278
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:55,168
Ince is cremated lickety-split.

279
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:57,241
No police. No inquest.

280
00:17:57,376 --> 00:18:00,709
The hearst papers
cover it up nice and quiet.

281
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:05,580
"The next morning, hearst offers louella"
a lifetime contract...

282
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:07,618
to keep her all hush-hush.

283
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,688
Now you tell me.

284
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:13,724
You still want to take a shaft
to a man like that?

285
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:19,360
Are you kidding me?
More than ever.

286
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:21,466
It's supposed to be siam...

287
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:25,235
some kind of balinese temple.

288
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:28,802
Does it look like
a temple to you?

289
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:37,444
"Marion,"
i've spoken to millicent.

290
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,287
She said no... again.

291
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,384
She believes it would put
her soul in peril.

292
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,426
"Divorce is a very serious sin,"
evidently.

293
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:54,522
It's bullshit.

294
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:58,261
It's bullshit. She just cares
"about the money, you know?"

295
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:01,463
She thinks i'll make you
cut her out of the will.

296
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:03,837
I do wish you wouldn't
use that language.

297
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,338
"He's a monster,"
an unfeeling monster...

298
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:07,503
like all great men.

299
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,807
"Yeah, but how"
do we dramatize that?

300
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,242
Say we say there was a time
when he was innocent.

301
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:15,252
There was a time when he...
when he lost something.

302
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:18,615
Something he loved?

303
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,558
You're off there.
Men like hearst don't love.

304
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:27,426
"All men love, orson,"
or have loved.

305
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:29,125
What about marion?

306
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:33,236
She's just another piece
in his collection.

307
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,670
She's just like one
of the animals in his zoo.

308
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:39,538
"To hearst, that is love. "i love you."
I built you a beautiful cage."

309
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,316
Love on his own terms.

310
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:50,212
No?

311
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,695
Love on your own terms.

312
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,324
Those are the only terms
anybody ever knows.

313
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:12,843
There's your tragedy.

314
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:41,238
"Orson, i'm in."

315
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,274
What?
I'll write it.

316
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:48,236
"Mank, that is the sweetest thing"
you've ever said to me.

317
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,577
I'll call george. I'll get a secretary.
"No, i'll get two secretaries."

318
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:53,674
We can get houseman.
Don't sit there. Start writing~

319
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:56,310
i just wanna know
when i'm gonna see a script.

320
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:59,948
How about a month? Is that acceptable?
'Acceptable"? No.

321
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,386
Anything more than three weeks
is totally unacceptable.

322
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:03,760
What do you want me to do?

323
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:05,796
"I've got new york on the phone,"
a fiscal quarter...

324
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,865
mank and houseman are writing already.
Who?

325
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,595
Herman mankiewicz.
Mank? That'd be a goddamn miracle

326
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:16,865
"a toast, then, jedediah,"
to love on my own terms.

327
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:21,412
Because those are the only terms
"anybody has ever known, his own."

328
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:26,315
Telegram from the christ child.

329
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:27,475
"Schaefer loves the idea. Stop.

330
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:30,417
Keep writing. Stop.
Stop drinking. Stop.

331
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,358
Did you work on the jigsaw puzzles?
Question mark.

332
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,518
Don't stop. Stop.
"Love you madly, orson."

333
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,027
Asshole. Stop.

334
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,446
So gregg toland plunks his oscar down
for wuthering heights and says...

335
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:01,542
"mr. Welles,"
i want to shoot your picture."

336
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:04,622
"Mr. Toland," i said, "you are the"
finest cinematographer in hollywood.

337
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:08,318
Why would you want to work
with a stumbling neophyte?"

338
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,927
"Mr. Welles," he replied..."

339
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:11,586
"the only way
to learn anything new...

340
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,391
is to work with someone
who doesn't know a thing."

341
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:14,897
Priceless.

342
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:18,801
"The whole point, hedda,"
is to use the language of cinema

343
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:20,962
as though it's never
been spoken before...

344
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:22,573
to challenge the audience.

345
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:25,438
Why does anyone go
to the movies in the first place?

346
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:26,408
To see themselves.

347
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:29,471
"To see their own bizarre, complex,"
fascinating and paradoxical lives...

348
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:31,980
"orson, talk english, will you?"

349
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:35,419
The most powerful narrative tool
ever invented...

350
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:37,454
and it's fallen
into the hands of bankers.

351
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:40,719
"Come on, louella. There's got to be"
something more to movies than money.

352
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:42,384
What's your favorite picture?

353
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:44,860
"Gold diggers, 1933."

354
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:50,401
So the transition
is somehow less painful...

355
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:53,003
as the audience leaves the theater
and returns to reality.

356
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:55,732
They feel as if their own lives
have been touched upon...

357
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:58,672
"that they have been given, well,"
at least a rendition of the truth...

358
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:00,506
that finally
they have been treated with...

359
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:02,579
this is all terribly interesting...

360
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:05,581
but what's all this i hear
about you and dolores del rio?

361
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:16,826
"Now, orson, you know,"
i'm just dying to see your picture...

362
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,829
and i know
it's gonna be boffo.

363
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:22,457
But the story's about a publisher.
"You're not doing hearst, are you?"

364
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:24,628
"Good god, no."

365
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,738
Our character
"is more an amalgam, really..."

366
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:29,807
look into my eyes and tell me
you're not doing hearst.

367
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:37,071
I'm not doing hearst.

368
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:08,544
Well?

369
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:17,610
It's too long.

370
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:21,883
Talk to houseman.
He's the one who wanted wide margins.

371
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:24,086
The flashback scheme
isn't working...

372
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:26,129
and keep susan and leland
separate at the end...

373
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:27,755
or there's no sense
of time lapse.

374
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:30,629
"If you do that,"
then the logic breaks down.

375
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:33,602
"Look, mank."
It's a brilliant script.

376
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:36,037
No question.
Absolutely brilliant.

377
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:39,076
"It needs some shaping, that's all."
Yeah. Sure.

378
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:41,077
We should celebrate.
"Drinks, housey."

379
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:43,647
I still have three weeks left
on my contract.

380
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:46,580
"If you prepare some notes,"
i'll do the revisions.

381
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:48,949
I don't have three weeks.
Schaefer wants it yesterday.

382
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:51,022
I'll send you the revisions.
And we need to change the name.

383
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,818
What? The title?
"No, no."

384
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:55,859
It's a grand title.
"American."

385
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:57,895
I was thinking more
the character name.

386
00:24:58,029 --> 00:25:03,467
Charles foster craig doesn't have the
'knives-out" poetry i was looking for.

387
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:05,798
I was thinking of "kane."

388
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:08,665
As in "abel"?

389
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,598
K-a-n-e.

390
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:12,609
One strong syllable. Kane.

391
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:15,110
'Craig" is one syllable.
Yes...

392
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:16,737
but it's not a great syllable.

393
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:17,974
"Thanks, housey."

394
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:24,484
"No, i haven't been drinking"
since i started this.

395
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:32,930
To my invaluable comrades.

396
00:25:39,971 --> 00:25:41,632
Good-bye.

397
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:45,576
"American"?

398
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,907
"It's an awful title, of course,"
but i can't think of anything better.

399
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:53,710
Someone came up with
"a sea of upturned faces"...

400
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:57,549
"which has a nice,"
sort of operatic ring to it.

401
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:58,984
I thought
"of"john citizen, u.s.a."..."

402
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:02,184
but that struck me
as a bit warner brothers...

403
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:04,727
"or, god forbid, capra-esque."

404
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:08,625
Citizen.
What?

405
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:09,961
"Citizen kane."

406
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:12,034
That's your title.

407
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,797
"Citizen kane."

408
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:17,674
A "z" and a "k." wouldn't look half bad
"on a poster, would it?"

409
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:19,073
Don't get ahead of yourself.

410
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:21,610
These budget projections
i know.

411
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:25,079
I don't know what you want me to do.
I've cut the script down to the bone.

412
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:27,150
"Listen, and don't throw a fit."

413
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:32,747
I want you to seriously think
about doing war of the worlds.

414
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:35,819
"Oh, god, george, please, no."
Do war of the worlds as a feature

415
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:37,929
and everybody will be happy.

416
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:41,692
Don't ask me to do this.
You're a 24-year-old novice director.

417
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:44,999
"This is difficult material,"
maybe impossible.

418
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:47,833
And old man hearst is gonna
come down on us with all he's got.

419
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:51,275
Think of the free publicity.
"Oh, please~"

420
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,976
"look, george,"
every idea has its moment.

421
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:56,945
This one is right now.
If it's half as good as i think it is...

422
00:26:57,048 --> 00:27:00,017
it's not a matter of good or bad.
At the end of the day...

423
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:02,176
why did you got into
"this business, george?"

424
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,753
Why?

425
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:06,016
Wasn't there a time when making pictures
meant something to you...

426
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:07,749
that it mattered
just a little bit...

427
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:10,019
that they were worth
taking risks for?

428
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:15,322
If you look into my eyes right now and
tell me to go make war of the worlds

429
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:17,726
i will.

430
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:19,030
I'll make it.

431
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,628
"And, yes, it'll make you money,"
and i honestly...

432
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:26,601
i can't think of a reason why
you should let me make this picture

433
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:27,675
except that you should.

434
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:33,342
"You know, i'd do anything"
to get you the hell out of my office.

435
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:38,946
Here.
Go make the goddamn picture.

436
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:41,919
Tracking...

437
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:46,390
"medium shot, close-up."

438
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:47,857
Reverse.

439
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:49,763
Medium shot.

440
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:52,760
Reverse. What lens is that?
- 24

441
00:27:53,738 --> 00:27:54,898
open aperture.

442
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,974
We used it on long voyage.

443
00:27:58,743 --> 00:28:00,404
Could you run
"that reel again, frank."

444
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:14,119
That's the one there.

445
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:18,793
"I'm not sure, mr. Welles."
"I'll try. Yeah, mr. Welles."

446
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:56,900
You fuck.

447
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:58,969
You selfish fuck.

448
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:05,174
"A studio pal, if that's"
"not an oxymoron, sent it to me."

449
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:11,382
"I thought we did it together, orson,"
i thought it was the two of us...

450
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:17,250
"but, you see,"
citizen kane by orson welles.

451
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:21,189
You took my name
off the fucking script?

452
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:24,750
It's a mistake. Some steno girl
obviously made a mistake.

453
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:28,196
You took my name off the script?
You can't do that.

454
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:32,235
I fucking well can. I own your goddamn
"script, and i can do anything i want~"

455
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:34,396
don't forget for one minute
that i took...

456
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:37,770
your 350 pages of drunken rambling
and made a movie out of them.

457
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:41,743
And now i've got to shoot
"the son of a bitch, so thank you"

458
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,379
"thank you very much,"
but i have all i need.

459
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:45,005
And stop calling me.

460
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:55,522
Today...

461
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:03,862
today we are beginning
a great adventure.

462
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:08,863
"Together, we're going to tell a story"
that i think is of some importance.

463
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:13,774
"Now, i won't lie to you. I have"
absolutely no idea what i'm doing.

464
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:18,907
Every one of you has had more time
on a soundstage that i have.

465
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:21,042
Every one of you
knows your job...

466
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,780
"and i, of course,"
am still learning mine.

467
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:27,948
I ask for your patience
and your help.

468
00:30:30,895 --> 00:30:32,920
And i ask for one other thing:
That you...

469
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:36,824
allow yourselves
to get a little lost with me...

470
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:41,335
to travel into the dark wood
of uncertainty...

471
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:43,999
to take a few wrong turns.

472
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:47,241
"Because along the way, l..."

473
00:30:47,378 --> 00:30:50,905
i think we just might discover
something amazing together.

474
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:56,885
"That's swell, orson. Now, where"
do you want to put the camera?

475
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,331
It's a director's contract.
Why the hell did you sign this?

476
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:16,601
"This is a suicide note, george."
The bastard's got us by the balls~

477
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:17,971
"i trust him, harry, deep down."

478
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:21,476
- Have you seen 24?
- Yeah. I've never seen anythinglike 24

479
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:22,841
i don't believe it.

480
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:24,380
What?

481
00:31:24,515 --> 00:31:27,040
"He shot three scenes,"
two with dialogue...

482
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:29,146
when he was only supposed
to be doing camera tests.

483
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:32,017
"George, the man is obviously"
an anarchist.

484
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:33,350
Yeah.

485
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:35,986
Who's two days
ahead of schedule.

486
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:39,120
Son of a bitch~ 281.

487
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:45,533
Look right in the lens. Don't take
"your eyes off it till i yell, " cut."

488
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:49,232
"Thank you, darling. The lines aren't"
important right now. Sit right here.

489
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:52,343
See if you can get your...
she's fine~ thank you.

490
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:55,037
Look right into the camera and
you'll be fine. All right? Great.

491
00:31:57,415 --> 00:32:00,009
I still think we should under-crank
and play it backwards.

492
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:01,949
"When i want your opinion,"
i'll ask for it.

493
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,352
"Collaboration, orson."
"Make it fast, andy~"

494
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:05,650
"call it, kit~"
roll camera~

495
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,924
and action~

496
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:21,129
"thank you, ladies and gentlemen."
That was terrific.

497
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:24,037
"Wonderful, dot, really."
Really wonderful. Top-notch.

498
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:28,068
"On the next one, maybe you"
could close your mouth.

499
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:30,171
We can go for
a slightly more subtle version.

500
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:31,907
"Well done, though."

501
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:35,049
Right.

502
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:39,020
Obviously we need to go again.

503
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:43,224
I'll be in makeup.

504
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:52,192
"Orson, you cannot just"
"destroy a camera, for chrissakes."

505
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:54,396
You know what these things cost?

506
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,030
"I know, george."
I feel terrible about it.

507
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:59,142
What about this one?
Black tie.

508
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:01,245
We borrowed one from next door.
"Stole it, really."

509
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:03,347
I don't think
they'll notice till monday.

510
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,711
"Look, i need"
"perhaps this, mr. Welles?"

511
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:08,951
Try the other one. I'm sorry.
I need agnes for another day.

512
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:11,044
Do you think you could
fix it for me?

513
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:13,953
"Good. Thanks, george."
I've got to run.

514
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:19,094
What?

515
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:24,667
Action.

516
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:26,628
Rosebud?

517
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:30,666
I'll tell you about rosebud.

518
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,738
Cut. Let's go again.

519
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:36,435
Action.

520
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:38,412
Rosebud?

521
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:39,415
Keep rolling.

522
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:40,643
Rosebud?

523
00:33:43,254 --> 00:33:46,057
I'll tell you about rosebud.

524
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:48,491
Cut. Again.

525
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:57,758
"Orson, you cannot shoot"
56 takes of one line.

526
00:33:58,102 --> 00:34:00,070
It's the climax of the picture.

527
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:03,264
The audience has been waiting for
two hours to find out what rosebud is.

528
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,308
"If they don't believe they're about to,"
we've let them down.

529
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:07,310
The trick doesn't work.
The whole picture depends on it~

530
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:08,344
it's one line.

531
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:11,471
"Cut, print, end of story."

532
00:34:49,787 --> 00:34:51,755
Drunk. What do you care?

533
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,718
You don't care about anything
except you.

534
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:59,229
You just want to persuade people
that you love 'em so much...

535
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:01,355
that they ought
to love you back.

536
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:04,161
Only you want love
on your own terms.

537
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:17,339
Orson?

538
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:20,841
You want to cut?

539
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:22,516
"No, keep rolling."

540
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:24,746
"Right. Sorry, joe."

541
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:26,857
Anywhere in your speech.

542
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:31,655
Action.

543
00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:36,599
Drunk. What do you care?

544
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:39,602
"And i'm looking at them,"
and they're looking back at me

545
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:42,673
waiting for something brilliant.

546
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:46,142
"The only thing is, so am i."

547
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:49,213
Waiting for some moment of inspiration
that will finally convince them all

548
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:54,444
that i'm worth all the time and trouble
and money they've invested in me.

549
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,678
"But i'm not, am i, mank?"

550
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:04,258
I'm just a fraud who couldn't care less
about anyone except himself.

551
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:05,590
Isn't that right?

552
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:09,261
I don't know.
Is that what you think?

553
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:14,168
I don't know what i think.
That's the problem.

554
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:20,611
I just know
that i miss you and...

555
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:27,749
i was wondering if you
might consider coming back.

556
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:32,156
First you wanted me out.
I'm out.

557
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:42,627
I'm sorry.

558
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:47,462
This is the shooting script
we've been using every day.

559
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:49,766
I thought you'd like to see it.

560
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:04,311
Did i ever tell you
about my father?

561
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:08,786
"He was a drunk, my dad."

562
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:13,453
"When my mother died,"
i was obliged to accompany him

563
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:15,862
on his business trips...
"europe, china."

564
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:18,902
"I suppose, in one sense,"
it was a way of seeing the world.

565
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:22,297
Richard head welles
and his amazing boy genius.

566
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:26,376
"But he would drink,"
and it would get embarrassing and...

567
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:31,475
"well, i began to resent him because"
"i was so sparkling, you see."

568
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:34,346
So when we got home
and i went off to school...

569
00:37:35,786 --> 00:37:37,720
i decided to cut him off.

570
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:41,851
I turned my back on him
because...

571
00:37:44,328 --> 00:37:46,296
i couldn't have him
getting in the way of my genius.

572
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:51,335
He would write me letters
that i would never answer.

573
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:55,596
"He would call me,"
and i would ignore his calls.

574
00:37:57,642 --> 00:38:01,305
"When he eventually visited me at school,"
i would manage to find myself...

575
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,310
conveniently indisposed.

576
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:07,016
"When i finally did see him again,"
he was in a coffin.

577
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:09,580
I was 15.

578
00:38:12,323 --> 00:38:13,483
And...

579
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:16,957
"all of a sudden,"
he wasn't the...

580
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:19,886
the embarrassing drunk anymore.

581
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:24,567
He was my father.

582
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:29,906
He was the man
who showed me the world.

583
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:38,444
Have you shot
the beach scene yet?

584
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:44,453
Good. It occurred to me
the other day...

585
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:48,552
that we're starting that scene
completely incorrectly.

586
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,471
Closer.

587
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:06,740
Closer. Stop.

588
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:08,435
Can you see my shoes?

589
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:10,809
"Yeah, but we lose your head."

590
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:15,085
Joe. Do me a favor
"and stand in here, will you?"

591
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:29,087
"Look, gregg,"
it has to be lower.

592
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:31,924
This is the scene. We have
to look up at these two men...

593
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:34,003
as pillars soaring to the sky...

594
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:35,663
towering virtues in combat...

595
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:38,536
orson~
we've been through this.

596
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:41,839
"We can't get the camera any lower,"
so find another goddamn shot~

597
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:52,881
what the fuck are you doing?
Looks like he's tearing out the floor

598
00:40:17,782 --> 00:40:19,716
it's four in the goddamn morning.

599
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:22,011
"My favorite time of day, gregg."

600
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:25,782
I've set back the sacred cause
"of reform, is that it?"

601
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:30,153
All right.

602
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:35,396
If that's the way they want it.
People have made their choice.

603
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:37,899
It's obvious the people
prefer jim gettys to me.

604
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:41,562
You talk about the people
as though you own them...

605
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:43,937
as though they belong to you.

606
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:48,509
"Orson, i'm so goddamn tired."

607
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:50,580
"Keep rolling, gregg."
I can't remember the lines.

608
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:53,047
"Come on, joe. You're drunk,"
you're angry. Use it.

609
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:57,587
We're not all hopped up on benzedrine.
Some of us humans need sleep.

610
00:40:57,721 --> 00:41:00,554
That's good.
Now give me the goddamn line.

611
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:03,525
You've been waiting for weeks to say
something to me. Don't go soft now.

612
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:05,686
You don't care about anything
except you.

613
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:09,526
You just want to persuade people
that you love 'em so much...

614
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:11,601
that they ought
to love you back.

615
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:13,525
Only you want love
on your own terms.

616
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:15,696
"A toast, then, jedediah."

617
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:19,598
To love on my own terms.

618
00:41:19,743 --> 00:41:21,870
Those are the only terms
anybody ever knows.

619
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:24,144
His own.

620
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:27,081
Cut. Print.
"What's next, gregg?"

621
00:41:27,184 --> 00:41:28,617
That's it.
We're done.

622
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:29,610
What?

623
00:41:29,753 --> 00:41:31,084
We're done.

624
00:41:39,196 --> 00:41:40,788
"How 'bout a real drink, then?"

625
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:51,607
"Mr. Welles,"
compliments of mr. Schaefer.

626
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:56,612
Daylight. Hey.
