1
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:50,007
On Christmas Eve, many years ago...

2
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,635
...I lay quietly in my bed.

3
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:55,138
I did not rustle the sheets.

4
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:58,599
I breathed slowly and silently.

5
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:04,480
I was listening for a sound
I was afraid I'd never hear.

6
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:09,944
The ringing bells of Santa's sleigh.

7
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,577
All right. All right, Sarah,
you had your water.

8
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:43,788
Now let's get you upstairs
and into bed.

9
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:46,582
But... But... But, I have to...

10
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:52,046
He said Santa would have to
fly faster than light...

11
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:56,050
...to get to every house in one night.
And to hold everyone's presents...

12
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:58,928
...his sled would be bigger
than an ocean liner.

13
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:03,099
Your brother said that? He was just
kidding you. He knows there's a Santa.

14
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:06,936
He said he wasn't sure.
He wasn't sure if Santa was for real.

15
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:10,147
Of course Santa is real.
He's as real as Christmas itself.

16
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:13,943
But he won't come until you're
sound asleep, young lady.

17
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:16,779
Sweet dreams.

18
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:19,949
Santa will be here before you know it.

19
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:22,118
So go to sleep.

20
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,998
"Stark, barren.

21
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,712
Devoid of life. "

22
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:27,892
He's gotta be asleep by now.

23
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:32,104
He used to stay awake all night
waiting for Santa.

24
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:35,858
Think those days are just about over.

25
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:37,944
That would be sad if that were true.

26
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,614
Yeah, an end of the magic.

27
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:45,368
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

28
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,585
See, he's out like a light.

29
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:57,922
An express train
wouldn't wake him up now.

30
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:03,636
"End of the magic"?

31
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:26,195
All aboard!

32
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,559
Well? You coming?

33
00:07:57,853 --> 00:07:59,061
Where?

34
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:01,397
Why, to the North Pole, of course.

35
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:05,401
This is the Polar Express.

36
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:08,070
The North Pole?

37
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:11,198
I see.

38
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:12,741
Hold this, please.

39
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,869
Thank you.

40
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:17,496
Is this you?

41
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,125
- Yeah.
- Well, it says here...

42
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:25,963
...no photo with a department-store
Santa this year, no letter to Santa.

43
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:29,800
And you made your sister
put out the milk and cookies.

44
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:32,636
Sounds to me like
this is your crucial year.

45
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:37,183
If I were you, I would think
about climbing onboard.

46
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:44,440
Come on, come on.
I've got a schedule to keep.

47
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:49,486
Suit yourself.

48
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,509
'Cause that's the way things happen
On the Polar Express

49
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:56,679
Whoo, whoo, the whistle blows
That's the sound of her singing

50
00:09:56,846 --> 00:10:00,099
Ding, ding, the bell will ring
Golly, look at her go

51
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:03,686
You wonder if we'll get there soon
Anybody's guess

52
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:07,106
'Cause that's the way things happen
On the Polar Express

53
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:10,859
When we get there
We'll scream, "Yay!"

54
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,279
We'll arrive with
A bang, bang, bang

55
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,698
Boom, boom, boom
Laughing all the way

56
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:19,034
With a comfy seat and lots to eat
Boy, it's just the best

57
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:22,413
Wish it wouldn't ever have to end

58
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,374
With a little luck, we'll be on time
There's no need to stress

59
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:30,045
'Cause that's the way things happen
On the Polar Express

60
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:36,552
Hey. Hey, you. Yeah, you.
Do you know what kind of train this is?

61
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:41,223
Train. Do you know what kind of train
this is? Do you?

62
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:44,727
Of course.

63
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,062
It's a magic train.

64
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:50,524
- We're going to the North Pole.
- I know it's a magic train.

65
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:53,277
It's a Baldwin 2-8-4 S3-class
steam locomotive...

66
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:58,365
...built in 1931 at the Baldwin Locomotive
Works. It weighs 456,100 pounds and...

67
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,743
Are we really going to the North Pole?

68
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:03,245
- Hey, look!
- Isn't that wonderful?

69
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:07,041
Herpolsheimer's! Herpolsheimer's!

70
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:14,798
Wow, look at all those presents.
I want all of them.

71
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:19,053
It's so Christmassy and cozy
and beautiful!

72
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:26,477
Tickets.

73
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,063
Tickets, please.

74
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,814
Tickets.

75
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:35,235
Ticket, please.

76
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,780
Try your pocket.

77
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,789
Try your other pocket.

78
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,474
Thank you, sir.

79
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,069
Hey, watch out, there.

80
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,904
Thank you, sir.

81
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:23,283
That is a public-address microphone.
It is not a toy.

82
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,536
Boy, that guy sure likes to show off.

83
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:28,497
Look what that wise guy
punched on my ticket.

84
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:34,503
"L-E." What the heck does that mean?
- Next stop, 11344 Edbrooke.

85
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:38,215
We're heading for the other side
of the tracks.

86
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:56,942
Well? You coming?

87
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:58,861
It's just another pickup.

88
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:02,489
That's weird. I thought you were
supposed to be the last one.

89
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:04,867
Why, to the North Pole, of course.

90
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,870
This is the Polar Express.

91
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:13,041
Suit yourself.

92
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:45,157
Hey, that kid wants
to get on the train.

93
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,076
Come on!

94
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:52,080
Hurry up!

95
00:13:58,463 --> 00:13:59,922
We have to stop the train.

96
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,591
- I don't know how.
- Pull the emergency brake!

97
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,457
Who in the blazes applied
that emergency brake?!

98
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,042
He did.

99
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,961
You.

100
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:44,299
In case you didn't know, that cord
is for emergency purposes only.

101
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:49,221
And in case you weren't aware,
tonight is Christmas Eve.

102
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:53,475
And in case you hadn't noticed,
this train is on a very tight schedule.

103
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:57,604
Now, young man, Christmas
may not be important to some people...

104
00:14:57,772 --> 00:15:01,233
...but it is very important
to the rest of us!

105
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,901
But... But...

106
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:06,655
He was just trying to stop the train
so that kid could get on.

107
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:12,327
I see. Young man,
is that what happened?

108
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,792
Well...

109
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:22,754
Let me remind you we are
on a very tight schedule.

110
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,173
And I've never been late before...

111
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:28,093
...and I am certainly not
going to be late tonight.

112
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:32,264
Now, everybody, take your seats, please!

113
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,352
Thank you.

114
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,691
Your attention, please.

115
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:47,362
Are there any Polar Express passengers
in need of refreshment?

116
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:50,490
- Me! Me! Me!
- I thought so.

117
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:00,542
- Hot, hot
- Oh, we got it

118
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,669
- Hot, hot
- Hey, we got it

119
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:05,589
- Hot, hot
- Say, we got it

120
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:07,049
Hot chocolate
Hot, hot

121
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,967
- Oh, we got it
- Hot, hot

122
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,886
- So we got it
- Hot, hot

123
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:13,347
Yo, we got it

124
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:16,058
- Hot chocolate
- Here we've only got one rule

125
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,101
Never, ever let it cool

126
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:19,936
Keep it cooking in the pot

127
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,898
- Then you got
- Hot chocolate

128
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:29,738
- Hot, hot
- Oh, we got it

129
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:31,281
- Hot, hot
- Hey, we got it

130
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:33,742
- Hot, hot
- Say, we got it

131
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:35,827
Hot chocolate
Hot, hot

132
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,746
- Oh, we got it
- Hot, hot

133
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:39,706
- So we got it
- Hot, hot

134
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:42,000
Yo, we got it

135
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:44,753
- Hot chocolate
- Here we only got one rule

136
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:46,588
Here we only got one rule

137
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:50,592
Never, ever let it cool

138
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,511
Keep it cooking in the pot

139
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:55,722
Soon you got hot chocolate

140
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:58,183
- Hot, hot
- Hey, we got it

141
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,102
- Hot, hot
- Oh, we got it

142
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,062
- Hot, hot
- Yeah, we got it

143
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,897
- Hot, hot
- Oh, we got it

144
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:05,774
- Hot, hot
- Yeah, we got it

145
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,568
- Oh, we got it
- Hot, hot

146
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,946
Yeah, we got it

147
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:29,381
You know, Montezuma,
the king of the Aztecs...

148
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:33,135
...would drink 50 quarts
of hot chocolate every day.

149
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:36,972
It was thick as mud and red.
He put chili pepper in instead of sugar.

150
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:40,517
- Get it? Hot chocolate?
- How do you know? That's not true.

151
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:43,478
- Where you going with that?
- It's for him.

152
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:48,024
- I don't think we're to leave our seats.
- It's a violation of safety regulations...

153
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:51,319
...for a kid to cross moving cars
without a grown-up.

154
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:53,071
I think I'll be okay.

155
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,657
Are you sure?

156
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,628
What about this lad in the back?
Did he get any refreshment?

157
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,841
Well, let's take some to him,
by all means.

158
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:19,389
Watch your step, now. Watch your step.

159
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,519
She forgot her ticket.

160
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:27,063
It hasn't been punched.

161
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:31,067
What are you doing?
You're gonna get us in trouble!

162
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:05,180
Young lady, forgive me.

163
00:21:05,348 --> 00:21:08,892
I believe I have neglected
to punch your ticket.

164
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,894
May I?

165
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:15,857
I left my ticket right here on the seat.

166
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,360
- But it's gone.
- You mean...

167
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:20,779
...you have lost your ticket.

168
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:22,864
She didn't lose her ticket.

169
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,825
I did.

170
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:29,537
I was trying to return it to you.

171
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:32,540
But the wind blew it out of my hand.

172
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,420
You can have my ticket.

173
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:45,720
These tickets are not transferable.

174
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:47,722
Young lady...

175
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,976
...you will just have to
come along with me.

176
00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:04,447
You know what's gonna happen now?
He's gonna throw her off the train.

177
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:07,575
He's gonna probably throw her
off the rear platform.

178
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:11,287
Standard procedure. That way,
she won't get sucked under the wheels.

179
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:14,708
They may slow the train down,
but they're never gonna stop it.

180
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,084
Stop it?

181
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:19,087
That's it! I have to stop the train again.

182
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:21,506
No, please, don't do that again.

183
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:54,748
Where'd they go?

184
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:56,833
What happened to them?

185
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:59,961
Please, she's in big trouble.
You have to help me.

186
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:44,172
Hey!

187
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:48,051
I found your ticket! Wait!

188
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:52,013
Hey!

189
00:23:53,224 --> 00:23:54,516
Wait!

190
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:57,102
I have your ticket!

191
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,390
Is there something I can do for you?

192
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:37,559
I'm looking for a girl.

193
00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:39,769
A gi...?

194
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,152
Ain't we all?

195
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,821
I have her ticket.

196
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:53,491
Well, lookie. Lookie here. What is this?

197
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:58,246
This is an official, authentic,
genuine ticket to ride.

198
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:01,916
You better keep this
in a safe place, young man.

199
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:03,501
If I was you...

200
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:06,337
I keep all my valuables right here.

201
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,673
Right here in the old size 13.

202
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:11,092
Experience shows
this is the safest place.

203
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:14,596
Not that I have much use for those.

204
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,014
Tickets.

205
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:17,765
I ride for free.

206
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:22,770
Oh, yeah, yeah. I hop aboard this rattler
any time I feels like it.

207
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,981
I own this train. Oh, yeah.

208
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:29,611
It's like I'm the king of this train.
Yeah. The king of the Pol Ex.

209
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:35,867
In fact, I am the king
of the North Pole!

210
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,913
Oh, where's my manners? Sit, sit. Sit.

211
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,748
Take a load off.

212
00:25:41,916 --> 00:25:44,250
Hey, would you like some Joe?

213
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:49,964
Nice hot refreshment.
Perfect for a cold winter's night.

214
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,851
There. Bless you.

215
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:05,980
What about Santa?

216
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:09,817
- Santa?
- Isn't he the king of the North Pole?

217
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:13,196
You mean this guy?

218
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:33,007
What exactly is your persuasion
on the big man?

219
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:34,509
Since you brought him up.

220
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:38,846
Well, I...

221
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:41,140
I want to believe.

222
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:45,061
- But...
- But you don't wanna be bamboozled.

223
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:48,314
You don't wanna be
led down the primrose path.

224
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:52,694
You don't wanna be conned or duped,
have the wool pulled over your eyes.

225
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:56,990
Hoodwinked. You don't wanna be
taken for a ride, railroaded.

226
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:03,871
Seeing is believing.

227
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:05,832
Am I right?

228
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,335
But what about this train?

229
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:12,380
What about it?

230
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:15,508
We're all really going
to the North Pole...

231
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:16,884
...aren't we?

232
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:19,470
Aren't we?

233
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:24,851
Are you saying
that this is all just a dream?

234
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:28,646
You said it, kid. Not me.

235
00:27:32,735 --> 00:27:36,154
So let's go find that girl.

236
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:44,537
One other thing.

237
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,957
Do you believe in ghosts?

238
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,546
Interesting.

239
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,717
Wait.

240
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:09,896
Wait!

241
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,444
I have to wake up.

242
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:18,654
Yeah. I have to wake up.

243
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:22,241
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.

244
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:24,660
Wake up!

245
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,721
Kid!

246
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:46,099
Kid, get your head out of the clouds!

247
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:47,809
Wake up, kid!

248
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:51,771
There's no sleepwalking
on the Polar Express.

249
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,607
We gotta jump them knuckles.

250
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:59,278
Come on, kid. Flip my shoulders.

251
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:01,280
Grab my lily.

252
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:06,411
That skirt you're chasing
must have moved ahead.

253
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:10,998
- We gotta hightail it to the hog, pronto.
- To the hog?

254
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:15,169
The engine. The engine, you tenderfoot.

255
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:18,548
We gotta make the engine
before we hit Flat Top Tunnel.

256
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:20,383
How come?

257
00:29:20,551 --> 00:29:23,177
So many questions.

258
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:27,932
There is but one inch of clearance
between the roof of this rattler...

259
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,977
...and the roof of Flat Top Tunnel.

260
00:29:31,145 --> 00:29:33,020
Savvy?

261
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:39,193
It's just the run up to the hump, kid.

262
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,696
This will be interesting.

263
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:06,596
Get back on, kid. Hurry!

264
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:09,056
Grab my muck stick.

265
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,261
There's only one trick to this, kid.

266
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,931
When I say "jump"...

267
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:56,270
...you jump!

268
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:22,255
You. I thought you got thrown off, and...

269
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:25,466
- You're driving the train?
- They put me in charge.

270
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:29,053
- The engineer had to check the light.
- Here's the light. Careful.

271
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:30,888
All right, now.

272
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,517
I got it.

273
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:40,731
- How do you know how?
- It's easy. Come here, I'll show you.

274
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,359
This big lever here, that's the throttle.

275
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:45,653
This little one here, that's the brake.

276
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:48,698
And those are the pressure gauges.

277
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:51,450
And that rope is the whistle.

278
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,828
The whistle.

279
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:56,539
You wanna try it?

280
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:02,378
I've wanted to do that my whole life.

281
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:09,093
Hold still! Hold still! Don't move!

282
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:11,304
Look!

283
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:26,986
Stop the train! Stop the train!

284
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,864
Stop the train!

285
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:34,535
What?

286
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:37,371
They want us to stop the train.

287
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:39,999
- Which one is the brake?
- He told me this was.

288
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:41,876
- Who?
- The engineer.

289
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:46,672
- The engineer? This one looks like a brake.
- No, he said this was the brake.

290
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:50,676
Are you sure?

291
00:32:57,768 --> 00:33:00,478
Pull the brake!

292
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:02,563
Stop the train!

293
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:21,874
Caribou?

294
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:28,297
There can be no Christmas without
the Polar Express arriving on time.

295
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:31,759
Am I the only one who understands that?

296
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:34,720
You. I should have known.

297
00:33:34,888 --> 00:33:38,766
Are you bound and determined that
this train never reaches the North Pole?

298
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:40,518
But look.

299
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,437
Caribou crossing?!

300
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:48,025
I make that herd to be at least
100,000, maybe even a million.

301
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:51,278
It's gonna be hours
before they clear this track.

302
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:55,491
- A tough nut to crack.
- We are in some serious jelly.

303
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:58,119
- And a jam.
- Tight spot.

304
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,620
- Up a creek.
- Up a tree.

305
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:02,998
- Lost in the grass.
- I'll tell you what's grass: Our a...

306
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:49,837
Problem solved. All ahead, slow.

307
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:37,718
We're going pretty fast.

308
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:40,763
Tell the engineer to slow down.

309
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:47,728
Slow it down.

310
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:52,358
Watch the speed!

311
00:35:57,405 --> 00:36:00,449
Jumping jeepers,
the cotter pin sheared off.

312
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:01,909
- What?
- The pin.

313
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:04,245
- Where?
- There.

314
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:05,955
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

315
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,917
- They can't hear me.
- They can't?

316
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,840
I don't like the look of this.
Under the safety bar.

317
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:19,885
Is everything all right?
What should we do?

318
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:24,515
Considering we've lost communication
with the engineer...

319
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:27,852
...we are standing totally exposed
on the front of the locomotive...

320
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:31,188
...the train appears to be
accelerating uncontrollably...

321
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:35,192
...and we are rapidly
approaching Glacier Gulch...

322
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,863
...which happens to be the steepest
downhill grade in the world...

323
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,324
...I suggest we all hold on...

324
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:45,119
...tightly.

325
00:37:05,307 --> 00:37:07,141
- The pin.
- The pin.

326
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:30,539
Jiminy Christmas, the ice has frozen
over the tracks.

327
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:55,105
Hold on. Hold on. No, no.

328
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:58,150
Come on. Watch your step.

329
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:01,528
Come on, sweetie.
Up you go. Up you go.

330
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:06,450
Put your feet on here. On here.

331
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:10,287
Little adventure, huh?

332
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:12,873
Young man, quick thinking on your part.

333
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:36,730
Step to your left, please. To your left.

334
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:44,071
Well, that is more like it.

335
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:49,159
What in the name of Mike?

336
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:53,747
Look.

337
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:59,128
Get us the blazes out of here!

338
00:39:07,387 --> 00:39:08,971
Turn this sled around.

339
00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:28,866
Look there.

340
00:39:31,578 --> 00:39:32,911
Tracks.

341
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,496
Dead ahead.

342
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:41,462
Right.

343
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:48,302
Left.

344
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:54,808
Right.

345
00:39:58,688 --> 00:39:59,938
Hang a Louie.

346
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:04,443
Toss a Ritchie.

347
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,490
Port astern.

348
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,494
To the starboard.

349
00:40:14,788 --> 00:40:17,372
- My slipper.
- You're gonna lose your ticket.

350
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,416
It's not my ticket, it's yours.

351
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:21,418
- It's my ticket?
- Yes.

352
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:23,712
Right. Keep up with me. Left.

353
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:26,465
Right. Left.

354
00:40:30,512 --> 00:40:31,845
Right.

355
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,472
Left.

356
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,015
Right.

357
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:37,142
Left. Right.

358
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:42,147
- Oh, no!
- Oh, no!

359
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:46,193
Brace yourselves!

360
00:40:57,247 --> 00:40:59,164
Well, that's more like it.

361
00:41:01,543 --> 00:41:03,085
Thank you.

362
00:41:03,253 --> 00:41:06,547
Thank you. I can't believe
you found my ticket.

363
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:09,716
Did someone say they found a ticket?

364
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:15,139
Well, in that case... Tickets, please.

365
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:25,566
Thank you.

366
00:41:27,277 --> 00:41:31,196
- "L-E"?
- Just like that know-it-all kid.

367
00:41:46,129 --> 00:41:48,714
Watch your step.
Tricky walking up here.

368
00:41:48,882 --> 00:41:51,258
It's mighty slick.
Mighty slick, I tell you.

369
00:41:52,427 --> 00:41:54,970
There you go. What did I tell you?

370
00:41:55,138 --> 00:42:00,267
Years ago, on my first Christmas Eve run,
I was up on the roof making my rounds...

371
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:02,352
...when I slipped on the ice myself.

372
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,939
I reached out for a hand iron,
but it broke off. I slid and fell.

373
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:10,110
And yet, I did not fall off this train.

374
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:12,946
Someone saved you?

375
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:15,115
Or something.

376
00:42:17,994 --> 00:42:19,286
An angel.

377
00:42:20,205 --> 00:42:21,872
Maybe.

378
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,124
Wait. Wait.

379
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:28,128
What did he look like? Did you see him?

380
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:33,133
No, sir. But sometimes
seeing is believing.

381
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:38,639
And sometimes the most real things
in the world are the things we can't see.

382
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:46,813
The forsaken and the abandoned.

383
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:51,985
Mind your step, now.
These poor toys have suffered enough...

384
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:56,490
...being left to rust and decay in the
back alleys and vacant lots of the world.

385
00:42:56,991 --> 00:43:01,161
- What are they doing here?
- It's a new concept the boss came up with.

386
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:04,706
Instead of being thrown away,
they're collected. Refurbished.

387
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:10,504
He calls it "rebicycling. "
Something like that.

388
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:15,175
Makes me wanna cry...

389
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:18,512
...seeing toys that were
treated this way.

390
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:23,517
These hopelessly entangled
string puppets and marionettes...

391
00:43:23,685 --> 00:43:27,980
...pose a particular problem. We found
the nimble fingers of our work force...

392
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:32,484
...here at the North Pole are best
for working out those knots and tangles.

393
00:43:32,652 --> 00:43:35,195
Thank you. Double-locked here.

394
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:50,043
You are just like me, my friend.

395
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:52,587
A scrooge!

396
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:54,923
Ebenezer Scrooge.

397
00:43:55,091 --> 00:43:58,427
North Pole, Santa Claus, this train...

398
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:02,514
...it's all a bunch of humbug.
A bout of indigestion.

399
00:44:02,682 --> 00:44:05,267
Oh, yeah. I know what you are.

400
00:44:05,435 --> 00:44:08,061
You're a doubter.

401
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:10,772
A doubter. You don't believe!

402
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:14,109
You're a doubter! You don't believe!

403
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:34,129
You missed it.
We rode down some really sharp hills.

404
00:44:34,297 --> 00:44:38,675
We were on what looked like a frozen lake.
But I know it was just an optical illusion.

405
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:41,762
He said the train was on ice.
I said it's impossible...

406
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:44,639
You can't put a train track...
Where you going now?

407
00:44:59,155 --> 00:45:02,115
I'm wishing on a star

408
00:45:02,283 --> 00:45:05,452
And trying to believe

409
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:08,789
That even though it's far

410
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:11,792
He'll find me Christmas Eve

411
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:15,545
I guess that Santa's busy

412
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:18,715
'Cause he's never come around

413
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:24,971
I think of him
When Christmas comes to town

414
00:45:25,765 --> 00:45:28,934
The best time of the year

415
00:45:29,102 --> 00:45:32,312
When everyone comes home

416
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,649
With all this Christmas cheer

417
00:45:35,817 --> 00:45:39,361
It's hard to be alone

418
00:45:39,529 --> 00:45:45,575
Putting up the Christmas tree
With friends who come around

419
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:52,124
It's so much fun
When Christmas comes to town

420
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:59,005
Presents for the children
Wrapped in red and green

421
00:45:59,549 --> 00:46:05,345
All the things I've heard about
But never really seen

422
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,682
No one will be sleeping

423
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:11,935
On the night of Christmas Eve

424
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:19,192
Hoping Santa's on his way

425
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:22,446
When Santa's sleighbells ring

426
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:25,490
I listen all around

427
00:46:25,658 --> 00:46:28,869
The herald angels sing

428
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:32,038
I never hear a sound

429
00:46:32,582 --> 00:46:36,042
And all the dreams of children

430
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:39,004
Once lost will all be found

431
00:46:39,172 --> 00:46:56,146
That's all I want
When Christmas comes to town

432
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,117
Look.

433
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:13,788
The northern lights.

434
00:47:16,626 --> 00:47:18,668
Hey. You three.

435
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:21,671
We just crossed it.

436
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:27,260
Latitude 66°33'.
The Arctic Circle.

437
00:47:27,428 --> 00:47:30,764
And do you see?
Those lights in the distance.

438
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:36,144
They look like the lights of a strange
ocean liner sailing on a frozen sea.

439
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:39,439
There...

440
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:42,150
...is the North Pole.

441
00:47:47,156 --> 00:47:49,991
It's a magic carpet on a rail
It never takes a rest

442
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:53,328
Flying through
The mountains and the snow

443
00:47:53,496 --> 00:47:56,456
You can ride for free and join the fun
If you just say yes

444
00:47:56,624 --> 00:47:59,960
'Cause that's the way things happen
On the Polar Express

445
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:03,255
Whoo, whoo, the whistle blows
That's the sound of her singing

446
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:06,633
Ding, ding, the bell will ring
Golly, look at her go

447
00:48:06,801 --> 00:48:09,803
You wonder if you'll get there soon
Anybody's guess

448
00:48:09,971 --> 00:48:13,181
'Cause that's the way things happen
On the Polar Express

449
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:16,476
When we get there
We'll scream, "Yay!"

450
00:48:16,644 --> 00:48:18,979
We'll arrive with
A bang, bang, bang

451
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:22,148
Boom, boom, boom
Laughing all the way

452
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:30,073
We made it. With five minutes to spare.

453
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:32,117
We made it.

454
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,853
There should be elves.
Where are the elves?

455
00:49:00,021 --> 00:49:01,688
Yeah, where are the elves?

456
00:49:01,856 --> 00:49:04,190
They are gathering
in the center of the city.

457
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:08,153
That is where Santa will give
the first gift of Christmas.

458
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:11,489
Who gets the first gift of Christmas?

459
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:15,535
He will choose one of you.

460
00:49:18,748 --> 00:49:21,541
- Look.
- Elves!

461
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:54,741
All right. All right,
ladies and gentlemen.

462
00:49:54,909 --> 00:49:57,619
Two columns, if you please.

463
00:49:57,787 --> 00:50:00,580
Shorter in the front, taller in the rear.

464
00:50:01,082 --> 00:50:04,709
Even-numbered birthdays on the right,
odd-numbered on the left.

465
00:50:04,877 --> 00:50:07,796
No pushing. No pushing.
But let's not dilly-dally.

466
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:09,881
It's five minutes to midnight.

467
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:13,635
Hey, what gives? It was five minutes
till midnight four minutes ago.

468
00:50:14,095 --> 00:50:16,596
Exactly. Columns of two.

469
00:50:16,764 --> 00:50:18,890
- One, two.
- Excuse me.

470
00:50:19,058 --> 00:50:21,518
- Question.
- What about him?

471
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:26,981
No one is required to see Santa.

472
00:50:28,109 --> 00:50:31,319
Ladies and gentlemen,
you do not have to hold hands...

473
00:50:31,487 --> 00:50:34,948
- Come on.
... but please remain in your columns...

474
00:50:35,116 --> 00:50:37,492
...while we are in transit.

475
00:50:47,128 --> 00:50:50,630
- Look, you have to come with us.
- She's right.

476
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:57,011
Christmas just doesn't work out
for me. Never has.

477
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:59,806
But Christmas is such a wonderful,
beautiful time.

478
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:03,601
It's a time for giving and being thankful,
for friends and family.

479
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:08,565
People hang decorations and lights. Santa
leaves presents under our Christmas trees.

480
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:12,235
Christmas just...

481
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:14,696
...doesn't work out for me.

482
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:20,201
Look, I don't know if Christmas
is gonna work out for you or not...

483
00:51:20,369 --> 00:51:23,496
...but this is Christmas Eve.
Don't stay here by yourself.

484
00:51:25,166 --> 00:51:26,708
Yes, come with us.

485
00:51:27,251 --> 00:51:29,043
We'll go together.

486
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:42,766
Oh, no.

487
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:52,692
We're gonna be okay.

488
00:51:55,029 --> 00:51:57,155
Maybe not!

489
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:03,119
The emergency brake.

490
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:10,627
There's no brake. I can't find the brake!

491
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:19,719
Take a break, kid.

492
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:23,556
How about a nice, good hot cup of Joe?

493
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:53,253
We're gonna crash!

494
00:53:00,261 --> 00:53:02,178
We're spinning.

495
00:53:27,955 --> 00:53:29,914
You hear that?

496
00:53:30,499 --> 00:53:31,791
The bell.

497
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:35,545
- What bell?
- The sleighbell.

498
00:53:35,713 --> 00:53:38,131
- Sleighbell?
- Don't you hear it?

499
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:42,010
It's coming from that tunnel.

500
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:49,684
That's the way we should go.

501
00:53:58,152 --> 00:53:59,694
Come on.

502
00:54:31,894 --> 00:54:33,478
What?

503
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:36,648
- What?
- Come on.

504
00:54:48,661 --> 00:54:49,661
Come on.

505
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:01,255
We're lost.

506
00:55:11,225 --> 00:55:12,642
Yes.

507
00:55:13,894 --> 00:55:16,813
- Yes. I hear it.
- I hear it too.

508
00:55:16,981 --> 00:55:21,067
- I don't hear anything.
- Okay, it's down this way.

509
00:55:21,235 --> 00:55:22,443
Are you sure?

510
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:28,282
Absolutely.

511
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:36,582
Why can't I hear anything?

512
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:41,796
Get down and be quiet.

513
00:55:50,931 --> 00:55:52,265
Yeah.

514
00:55:55,269 --> 00:55:56,811
Okay.

515
00:55:57,730 --> 00:55:59,856
Well, that was the wrapping hall, chief.

516
00:56:00,024 --> 00:56:02,608
- Just finished the last one.
- How's it wrapped?

517
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:06,696
It's wrapped in candy-striped red
with a number-seven holly-green bow.

518
00:56:06,864 --> 00:56:10,158
A number-seven bow?
When we're this close to liftoff?

519
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:13,786
What are they thinking down there?
Are they meshuggener?

520
00:56:13,954 --> 00:56:16,205
- What's the routing?
- Going to the States.

521
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:18,583
Grand Rapids, Michigan.

522
00:56:19,126 --> 00:56:22,128
That's my town. I'm from Grand Rapids.

523
00:56:27,426 --> 00:56:30,470
We got a troublemaker now.
Just what we need.

524
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:33,556
Things aren't bad enough.
What's his 20?

525
00:56:33,724 --> 00:56:37,018
Apparently, some kid
from Maplewood, New Jersey...

526
00:56:37,186 --> 00:56:39,604
...stuck some gum in his sister's hair.

527
00:56:40,481 --> 00:56:43,524
New Jersey? Is that the same kid
that put the tack...

528
00:56:43,859 --> 00:56:48,696
...underneath his teacher's chair last year?
- No, sir. This kid's name is Steven.

529
00:56:49,865 --> 00:56:52,825
So, what do we do, chief?
Alert the big man?

530
00:56:52,993 --> 00:56:55,995
We talking nothing for Christmas here?

531
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:08,549
I didn't do it.

532
00:57:10,886 --> 00:57:13,346
Look, it's...
It's almost Christmas, huh?

533
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:15,681
We'll cut the kid a break.

534
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:18,142
But put him on the check-twice list
for next year.

535
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:20,978
All right, boys.

536
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:24,273
Let's shut it down.
That's it for this year. Come on.

537
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:28,986
- Hey, boss, are we taking the pneumatic?
- Of course we're taking the pneumatic.

538
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:32,323
It's the only way to get
to the square on time.

539
00:57:32,491 --> 00:57:35,743
- Let's go.
- And time is money.

540
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:39,122
Ready, and mount.

541
00:57:40,541 --> 00:57:43,209
Good. Close.

542
00:57:57,766 --> 00:57:59,600
All right, get in.

543
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:03,187
I don't know about this.

544
00:58:38,098 --> 00:58:40,933
I don't hear it. Do you?

545
00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:43,895
No.

546
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:48,024
I think we should follow those arrows.

547
00:59:02,289 --> 00:59:04,749
I thought there'd be a way out.

548
00:59:04,917 --> 00:59:07,126
We're gonna miss everything.

549
00:59:17,137 --> 00:59:18,763
Hey, look.

550
00:59:20,224 --> 00:59:21,766
A present.

551
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:29,106
It's going to my town.
To someone named Billy.

552
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:34,862
- My name is Billy.
- It's going to 11344 Edbrooke Avenue.

553
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:36,906
That's my address.

554
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:46,290
Come on.

555
01:00:46,393 --> 01:00:47,727
Look.

556
01:00:49,271 --> 01:00:52,732
It says, "Merry Christmas, Billy.
From Mr. C."

557
01:00:53,734 --> 01:00:58,112
I think I know what it is.
I wanted one of these my whole life.

558
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:01,407
Wait, wait. Stop. Look.

559
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:05,619
But I...

560
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:07,621
Those are the rules.

561
01:03:08,535 --> 01:03:10,202
Something's got me.

562
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:12,079
It's got my leg.

563
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:13,998
I can't hold him.

564
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:17,460
Give me your other hand.
Give me your other hand.

565
01:03:17,836 --> 01:03:20,171
- I can't.
- On three.

566
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:23,466
One, two, three.

567
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:26,218
- Look.
- It's still got me.

568
01:03:26,386 --> 01:03:29,722
On three again. One, two, three.

569
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:34,560
- You.
- You.

570
01:03:34,728 --> 01:03:36,770
- What are you doing here?
- Same as you.

571
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:40,524
Checking my presents. Making sure
I'm getting everything on my list.

572
01:03:40,692 --> 01:03:43,611
I found one present.
All it had was stupid underwear.

573
01:03:43,778 --> 01:03:45,404
Look.

574
01:03:53,955 --> 01:03:56,165
You may start your descent
any time now.

575
01:03:56,333 --> 01:03:58,584
At your convenience, of course.

576
01:04:10,764 --> 01:04:14,183
It's still five to.
I think we're gonna make it.

577
01:04:14,351 --> 01:04:16,977
Of course. It's been five to
for the last hour.

578
01:04:17,145 --> 01:04:20,731
We got plenty of time. We got nothing
but time. We got time to kill.

579
01:04:20,899 --> 01:04:24,652
You know what?
I don't think we're gonna make it.

580
01:04:27,072 --> 01:04:30,199
I may be just an old railroader...

581
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:33,160
...and know nothing about
lighter-than-air craft...

582
01:04:33,328 --> 01:04:38,832
...but from my layman's perspective,
you need more altitude!

583
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,460
More altitude!

584
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:45,130
Altitude, please. A bit more altitude, please.

585
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:48,300
Geronimo!

586
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:05,192
The Flying Elves.

587
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:08,153
They are specialists.
Do not try that at home, kids.

588
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:10,281
Do not try that at home.

589
01:05:10,448 --> 01:05:11,699
We're not gonna make it.

590
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:53,574
A well-oiled machine.

591
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:06,211
All right, you stowaways.

592
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:09,798
- Party's over.
- I was just following them.

593
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:11,884
We fell in here by mistake.

594
01:06:12,052 --> 01:06:15,763
Forget about it. We knew you
was in there the whole time.

595
01:06:17,682 --> 01:06:19,058
Come on, out you go.

596
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:22,936
Let's go, come on.
Step up, step up. There we go.

597
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:26,357
Not a problem. Come on.
Watch your step. There you go.

598
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:35,574
So nobody gets hurt, here's
how we're gonna get you guys down.

599
01:06:35,742 --> 01:06:39,078
- This is simple. Why, I know...
- What do you know?

600
01:06:39,412 --> 01:06:42,915
You're not supposed to be here
in the first place.

601
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:47,586
But since it's Christmas,
I'm gonna let you slide.

602
01:06:47,754 --> 01:06:48,754
Hey.

603
01:06:51,299 --> 01:06:52,633
Been looking for you.

604
01:06:55,762 --> 01:06:57,137
There you go.

605
01:06:57,305 --> 01:06:58,555
Watch your step.

606
01:06:58,723 --> 01:07:00,641
Careful.

607
01:07:00,809 --> 01:07:02,893
Beautiful form. Beautiful.

608
01:07:03,061 --> 01:07:05,437
Nice to see you again.

609
01:07:07,315 --> 01:07:10,067
Cutting it kind of close, aren't we?

610
01:07:10,235 --> 01:07:13,821
I'll take care of this.

611
01:07:13,988 --> 01:07:16,115
It's in good hands.

612
01:07:16,282 --> 01:07:18,951
Trust me.

613
01:07:47,355 --> 01:07:50,983
It's the spirit of the season

614
01:07:51,151 --> 01:07:54,695
You can feel it in the air

615
01:07:54,863 --> 01:07:58,615
You can hear it if you listen

616
01:07:58,783 --> 01:08:02,453
Everywhere
So much care

617
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:04,329
Like a prayer

618
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:08,167
Whatever it is
You need to share it

619
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:28,020
It's the spirit of the season

620
01:08:32,525 --> 01:08:36,904
You can feel it in the air

621
01:08:50,293 --> 01:08:53,420
Aren't those bells
the most beautiful sound?

622
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:11,164
He's here! He's here!

623
01:10:11,332 --> 01:10:12,583
Where?

624
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:15,127
I see him. He's over there.

625
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:38,984
I can't see him.

626
01:10:39,152 --> 01:10:41,945
I can't see him!

627
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:48,053
Doubter. Doubter.

628
01:11:51,641 --> 01:11:56,103
Okay.

629
01:11:58,606 --> 01:12:04,861
I believe.

630
01:12:33,975 --> 01:12:36,268
What was that you said?

631
01:12:40,565 --> 01:12:43,442
L... I believe.

632
01:12:47,739 --> 01:12:49,781
I believe.

633
01:12:51,659 --> 01:12:55,912
L... I believe that this is yours.

634
01:12:57,540 --> 01:12:59,124
Well...

635
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:02,210
Thank you.

636
01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:05,630
- Me, me. Pick me, Santa.
- What are you doing? Stop it.

637
01:13:05,798 --> 01:13:08,884
- Pick me, pick me. I want the first gift.
- Hush.

638
01:13:09,052 --> 01:13:11,011
Young man...

639
01:13:11,179 --> 01:13:13,013
...patience.

640
01:13:13,181 --> 01:13:17,851
And a smidgen of humility
might also serve you well.

641
01:13:18,019 --> 01:13:19,644
Yes, sir.

642
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:23,273
And you, young lady...

643
01:13:23,441 --> 01:13:25,150
A lady of decision.

644
01:13:25,318 --> 01:13:29,237
Full of confidence and spirit.

645
01:13:29,989 --> 01:13:31,615
Christmas spirit.

646
01:13:34,452 --> 01:13:35,994
Keep up the good work.

647
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:39,039
Thank you.

648
01:13:39,999 --> 01:13:41,625
And Billy.

649
01:13:43,127 --> 01:13:44,836
It is Billy?

650
01:13:46,672 --> 01:13:49,216
I see you've made some new friends.

651
01:13:51,928 --> 01:13:53,470
Yes, sir. I sure have.

652
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:55,889
That's a lucky lad.

653
01:13:56,057 --> 01:13:58,517
There's no greater gift than friendship.

654
01:14:01,521 --> 01:14:04,439
And speaking of gifts...

655
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:11,363
...let's have this young fellow
right here.

656
01:14:48,860 --> 01:14:50,443
Now...

657
01:14:50,611 --> 01:14:53,613
...what would you like for Christmas?

658
01:14:53,781 --> 01:14:55,657
Me.

659
01:14:55,825 --> 01:14:57,242
You.

660
01:15:11,757 --> 01:15:14,593
Yes. Indeed.

661
01:15:17,430 --> 01:15:19,931
Yes, indeed.

662
01:15:26,731 --> 01:15:30,525
The first gift of Christmas!

663
01:15:45,082 --> 01:15:48,835
This bell is a wonderful symbol
of the spirit of Christmas...

664
01:15:49,003 --> 01:15:51,546
...as am I.

665
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:54,883
Just remember...

666
01:15:55,051 --> 01:15:57,802
...the true spirit of Christmas...

667
01:15:57,970 --> 01:16:00,305
...lies in your heart.

668
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:13,652
Merry Christmas.

669
01:16:15,696 --> 01:16:18,531
Better keep that in a safe place.

670
01:16:38,427 --> 01:16:43,306
Hey, hey. Man alive, are you lucky.

671
01:17:05,538 --> 01:17:08,164
Pull, Comet. Pull, boy!

672
01:17:11,335 --> 01:17:13,545
Prancer, that's a girl.

673
01:17:18,175 --> 01:17:20,427
Good boy, Donder.

674
01:17:52,251 --> 01:17:56,546
Now, Dasher. Now, Prancer and Vixen.

675
01:18:05,389 --> 01:18:08,475
It's everything I dreamed it would be.

676
01:18:08,642 --> 01:18:10,435
Could all...?

677
01:18:10,603 --> 01:18:13,563
Could all this be nothing but a dream?

678
01:18:13,731 --> 01:18:15,273
No.

679
01:18:27,578 --> 01:18:29,996
To the top of the roof
To the top of the wall

680
01:18:30,164 --> 01:18:35,001
Now, dash away, dash away
Dash away all

681
01:19:07,493 --> 01:19:10,370
All aboard!

682
01:19:10,538 --> 01:19:12,455
One, two. One, two, three, go.

683
01:19:12,623 --> 01:19:16,501
Rockin' on top of the world
Rockin' on top of the world

684
01:19:16,669 --> 01:19:18,837
The place is hoppin'
There ain't no stoppin'

685
01:19:19,004 --> 01:19:22,882
Rockin' on top of the world
Lift your spirits, swing that girl

686
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:25,718
Rockin' on top of the world
Tonight, yeah

687
01:19:25,886 --> 01:19:28,221
Come on, shorty!

688
01:19:41,277 --> 01:19:43,695
Show your tickets.
Have your tickets ready.

689
01:19:43,863 --> 01:19:46,406
Remember to eat
the five basic food groups.

690
01:19:46,574 --> 01:19:48,366
Ticket, please.

691
01:19:48,534 --> 01:19:51,828
And please brush after every meal.

692
01:19:54,957 --> 01:19:57,375
Remember to duck and cover.

693
01:19:57,543 --> 01:19:59,169
All right, you. Ticket, please.

694
01:20:07,052 --> 01:20:09,637
"Lean. " Whatever that's
supposed to mean.

695
01:20:09,805 --> 01:20:12,098
"Lean" is spelled with four letters.

696
01:20:12,266 --> 01:20:14,517
I believed I punched five.

697
01:20:16,729 --> 01:20:19,564
Hey, are you saying
I don't know how to...?

698
01:20:19,732 --> 01:20:22,984
I'm sorry. It says "learn. " My mistake.

699
01:20:23,152 --> 01:20:25,069
Lesson learned.

700
01:20:25,237 --> 01:20:26,613
Ticket.

701
01:20:43,422 --> 01:20:44,923
That is some special ticket.

702
01:20:45,090 --> 01:20:46,591
Sure is.

703
01:20:46,759 --> 01:20:51,054
So can you count on us
to get you home safe and sound?

704
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:54,891
Absolutely.

705
01:20:55,059 --> 01:20:56,559
Me...

706
01:20:57,811 --> 01:20:59,854
...and my friends.

707
01:21:02,608 --> 01:21:03,816
Ticket.

708
01:21:12,368 --> 01:21:15,453
It says "lead. " Like "lead balloon. "

709
01:21:15,621 --> 01:21:18,289
I believe it also is pronounced "lead. "

710
01:21:18,457 --> 01:21:20,416
As in "leader," "leadership. "

711
01:21:20,584 --> 01:21:22,794
"Lead the way. "

712
01:21:22,962 --> 01:21:25,171
Follow you anywhere, ma'am.

713
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:29,342
Ah, yes.

714
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:32,470
Young man with all the questions.

715
01:21:32,972 --> 01:21:34,389
Ticket.

716
01:21:44,441 --> 01:21:46,651
It says...

717
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:48,528
It's nothing I need to know.

718
01:21:59,415 --> 01:22:01,791
- Come on, let's see the bell.
- Let's see it.

719
01:22:01,959 --> 01:22:04,669
- Come on, let's see the bell.
- Show us the bell.

720
01:22:04,837 --> 01:22:07,005
Yeah, let's see the bell.

721
01:22:14,305 --> 01:22:16,014
It's gone.

722
01:22:17,266 --> 01:22:20,101
- Where is it?
- I lost it.

723
01:22:20,269 --> 01:22:22,854
I lost the bell from Santa's sleigh.

724
01:22:23,022 --> 01:22:24,856
It's gone?

725
01:22:26,191 --> 01:22:27,525
Don't worry.

726
01:22:27,693 --> 01:22:30,111
- We'll... We'll find it.
- Yeah, we'll find it.

727
01:22:30,279 --> 01:22:32,614
Yeah, we'll help you. All of us.

728
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:35,617
Yeah, let's hurry out
and find it right now.

729
01:22:45,127 --> 01:22:46,878
It's too late.

730
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:50,882
Gee, that's really too bad.

731
01:22:51,884 --> 01:22:53,551
Really.

732
01:23:08,067 --> 01:23:09,901
I'm sorry.

733
01:23:40,766 --> 01:23:44,769
11344 Edbrooke.

734
01:23:44,937 --> 01:23:50,400
Next stop, 11344 Edbrooke.

735
01:23:57,700 --> 01:23:59,617
Hey, where you going?

736
01:24:00,619 --> 01:24:01,744
Home.

737
01:24:01,912 --> 01:24:05,498
Oh, okay. Merry Christmas.

738
01:24:10,546 --> 01:24:13,464
Thanks for stopping the train for me.

739
01:24:19,304 --> 01:24:20,930
Have a wonderful Christmas.

740
01:24:23,016 --> 01:24:25,518
Watch your step, please.

741
01:24:27,146 --> 01:24:29,147
And merry Christmas.

742
01:24:46,165 --> 01:24:47,457
Look.

743
01:24:50,127 --> 01:24:53,004
Santa got to Billy's house already.

744
01:24:55,799 --> 01:24:58,551
Look, look! Santa got here!

745
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:00,303
Isn't that amazing?

746
01:25:00,471 --> 01:25:11,397
It is amazing.

747
01:25:57,736 --> 01:26:00,029
I'm sorry about the bell.

748
01:26:00,614 --> 01:26:03,282
It was a really special present.

749
01:26:03,450 --> 01:26:05,201
Well, you know what they say.

750
01:26:05,369 --> 01:26:07,662
It's the thought that counts.

751
01:26:08,330 --> 01:26:09,789
Yeah.

752
01:26:10,958 --> 01:26:13,835
Well, see you.

753
01:26:16,421 --> 01:26:17,964
Well...

754
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:20,216
...see you.

755
01:26:21,093 --> 01:26:22,593
See you.

756
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:38,901
Watch your step, please.

757
01:26:40,153 --> 01:26:41,404
Thank you.

758
01:26:41,572 --> 01:26:44,115
No, thank you.

759
01:26:45,868 --> 01:26:47,660
One thing about trains:

760
01:26:47,828 --> 01:26:49,912
It doesn't matter where they're going.

761
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:54,125
What matters is deciding to get on.

762
01:27:11,101 --> 01:27:12,602
Merry Christmas!

763
01:27:16,315 --> 01:27:17,523
What?

764
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:23,195
Merry Christmas!

765
01:28:31,723 --> 01:28:36,102
Wake up. Wake up.
Santa's been here. Santa's been here.

766
01:28:36,269 --> 01:28:37,937
Hurry up. Hurry up!

767
01:28:38,105 --> 01:28:41,440
Mom, Dad, wake up. Wake up!

768
01:28:41,608 --> 01:28:44,610
Santa's been here! Santa's been here!

769
01:28:44,778 --> 01:28:48,698
Mom, Dad, look!
He brought us all kinds of stuff!

770
01:28:48,865 --> 01:28:51,409
Look, a train!

771
01:29:07,801 --> 01:29:13,305
This is the beautiful-est,
most wonderful-est Christmas ever.

772
01:29:13,473 --> 01:29:15,766
Wait. Look.

773
01:29:17,060 --> 01:29:18,936
Here's one more.

774
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:22,356
Has your name on it.

775
01:29:51,344 --> 01:29:53,846
Found this on the seat of my sleigh.

776
01:29:54,014 --> 01:29:56,682
Better fix that hole in your pocket.

777
01:29:56,850 --> 01:29:58,100
Mr. C.

778
01:30:08,153 --> 01:30:11,322
Oh, what a beautiful bell.
Who's it from?

779
01:30:11,490 --> 01:30:13,532
- Santa.
- Santa?

780
01:30:13,700 --> 01:30:15,326
Really?

781
01:30:16,369 --> 01:30:18,788
- Oh, that's too bad.
- What's this?

782
01:30:19,831 --> 01:30:21,332
Broken.

783
01:30:22,459 --> 01:30:24,627
Sorry about that, sport.

784
01:30:29,174 --> 01:30:32,301
Come on, kids. We don't wanna be late.

785
01:30:40,352 --> 01:30:43,854
At one time, most of my friends
could hear the bell.

786
01:30:44,022 --> 01:30:48,067
But as years passed,
it fell silent for all of them.

787
01:30:48,235 --> 01:30:53,531
Even Sarah found, one Christmas, that she
could no longer hear its sweet sound.

788
01:30:53,698 --> 01:30:55,366
Though I've grown old...

789
01:30:55,534 --> 01:30:57,910
...the bell still rings for me.

790
01:30:58,078 --> 01:31:02,164
As it does for all who truly believe.
