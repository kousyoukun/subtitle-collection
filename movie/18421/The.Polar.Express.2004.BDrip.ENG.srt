1
00:00:47,258 --> 00:00:50,178
<i>On Christmas Eve, many years ago...</i>

2
00:00:50,345 --> 00:00:52,805
<i>...I lay quietly in my bed.</i>

3
00:00:53,014 --> 00:00:55,308
<i>I did not rustle the sheets.</i>

4
00:00:55,516 --> 00:00:58,770
<i>I breathed slowly and silently.</i>

5
00:00:58,936 --> 00:01:04,650
<i>I was listening for a sound
I was afraid I'd never hear.</i>

6
00:01:05,026 --> 00:01:10,114
<i>The ringing bells of Santa's sleigh.</i>

7
00:02:38,118 --> 00:02:40,245
All right. All right, Sarah...

8
00:02:40,454 --> 00:02:41,747
...you had your water.

9
00:02:41,955 --> 00:02:43,957
Now let's get you upstairs
and into bed.

10
00:02:44,124 --> 00:02:46,752
But... But... But, I have to...

11
00:02:49,463 --> 00:02:52,215
He said Santa would have to
fly faster than the speed of light...

12
00:02:52,382 --> 00:02:56,219
...to get to every house in one night.
And to hold everyone's presents...

13
00:02:56,386 --> 00:02:59,097
...his sled would be bigger
than an ocean liner.

14
00:02:59,306 --> 00:03:03,268
Your brother said that? He was just
kidding you. He knows there's a Santa.

15
00:03:03,477 --> 00:03:07,105
He said he wasn't sure.
He wasn't sure if Santa was for real.

16
00:03:07,314 --> 00:03:10,317
Of course Santa's for real.
He's as real as Christmas itself.

17
00:03:10,483 --> 00:03:11,818
But he won't come...

18
00:03:11,985 --> 00:03:14,112
...until you're sound asleep,
young lady.

19
00:03:15,155 --> 00:03:16,948
Sweet dreams.

20
00:03:17,824 --> 00:03:20,118
Santa will be here before you know it.

21
00:03:20,327 --> 00:03:21,995
So go to sleep.

22
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:58,323
Mm-hm.

23
00:04:06,956 --> 00:04:09,167
"Stark, barren.

24
00:04:12,378 --> 00:04:14,881
Devoid of life. "

25
00:04:25,892 --> 00:04:28,144
He's gotta be asleep by now.

26
00:04:28,311 --> 00:04:30,021
He used to stay awake all night...

27
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:32,356
...waiting for Santa.

28
00:04:32,815 --> 00:04:36,110
Think those days are just about over.

29
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:38,195
That would be sad if that were true.

30
00:04:38,404 --> 00:04:41,866
Yeah, an end of the magic.

31
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:45,619
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

32
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:54,837
See, he's out like a light.

33
00:04:55,004 --> 00:04:58,174
An express train
wouldn't wake him up now.

34
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,637
<i>"End of the magic"?</i>

35
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:19,272
All aboard!

36
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:26,445
All aboard!

37
00:07:54,181 --> 00:07:56,851
Well? You coming?

38
00:07:58,102 --> 00:07:59,311
Where?

39
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,647
Why, to the North Pole, of course.

40
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:05,651
This is the Polar Express.

41
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,320
The North Pole?

42
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,448
I see.

43
00:08:11,615 --> 00:08:12,992
Hold this, please.

44
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,119
Thank you.

45
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:17,746
Is this you?

46
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,375
- Yeah.
- Well, it says here...

47
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:26,213
...no photo with a department-store
Santa this year, no letter to Santa.

48
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:30,050
And you made your sister
put out the milk and cookies. Mm-mm.

49
00:08:30,634 --> 00:08:32,886
Sounds to me like
this is your crucial year.

50
00:08:33,053 --> 00:08:37,432
If I were you, I would think
about climbing onboard.

51
00:08:40,227 --> 00:08:44,690
Come on, come on, come on.
I've got a schedule to keep... Oh.

52
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,736
Suit yourself.

53
00:09:50,088 --> 00:09:51,756
<i>'Cause that's the way things happen</i>

54
00:09:51,965 --> 00:09:53,758
<i>On the Polar Express</i>

55
00:09:53,967 --> 00:09:56,928
<i>Whoo, whoo, the whistle blows
That's the sound of her singing</i>

56
00:09:57,136 --> 00:10:00,348
<i>Ding, ding, the bell will ring
Golly, look at her go</i>

57
00:10:00,515 --> 00:10:03,935
<i>You wonder if we'll get there soon
Anybody's guess</i>

58
00:10:04,102 --> 00:10:07,355
<i>'Cause that's the way things happen
On the Polar Express</i>

59
00:10:07,563 --> 00:10:11,109
<i>When we get there
We'll scream, "Yay!"</i>

60
00:10:11,317 --> 00:10:13,528
<i>We'll arrive with
A bang, bang, bang</i>

61
00:10:13,736 --> 00:10:15,947
<i>Boom, boom, boom
Laughing all the way</i>

62
00:10:16,155 --> 00:10:19,283
<i>With a comfy seat and lots to eat
Boy, it's just the best</i>

63
00:10:19,492 --> 00:10:22,662
<i>Wish it wouldn't ever have to end</i>

64
00:10:22,829 --> 00:10:25,623
<i>With a little luck, we'll be on time
There's no need to stress</i>

65
00:10:25,832 --> 00:10:30,294
<i>'Cause that's the way things happen
On the Polar Express</i>

66
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:36,801
Hey. Hey, you. Yeah, you.
Do you know what kind of train this is?

67
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,095
- Huh?
- Train.

68
00:10:39,345 --> 00:10:41,472
Do you know what kind of train this is?
Well, do you?

69
00:10:42,431 --> 00:10:44,976
- Uh...
Of course.

70
00:10:45,184 --> 00:10:47,311
It's a magic train.

71
00:10:47,687 --> 00:10:50,773
- We're going to the North Pole.
I know it's a magic train.

72
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,526
Actually it's a Baldwin 2-8-4 S3-class
steam locomotive...

73
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:58,614
...built in 1931 at the Baldwin Locomotive
Works. It weighs 456,100 pounds and...

74
00:10:58,781 --> 00:11:00,991
Are we really going to the North Pole?

75
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,494
Hey, look, everybody!
- Mm-hm. Isn't that wonderful?

76
00:11:03,661 --> 00:11:05,996
Herpolsheimer's! Herpolsheimer's!

77
00:11:12,002 --> 00:11:15,047
Wow, look at all those presents.
I want all of them.

78
00:11:15,214 --> 00:11:19,301
It's so Christmassy and cozy
and beautiful!

79
00:11:25,391 --> 00:11:26,725
Tickets.

80
00:11:27,226 --> 00:11:29,311
Tickets, please.

81
00:11:29,478 --> 00:11:31,063
Tickets.

82
00:11:34,233 --> 00:11:35,484
Ticket, please.

83
00:11:36,151 --> 00:11:38,028
Try your pocket.

84
00:11:44,493 --> 00:11:47,037
Try your other pocket.

85
00:12:04,179 --> 00:12:05,722
Thank you, sir.

86
00:12:15,857 --> 00:12:17,234
Hey, watch out, there.

87
00:12:17,442 --> 00:12:19,069
Thank you, sir.

88
00:12:19,778 --> 00:12:23,448
Uh-uh-uh. That is a public-address
microphone. It is not a toy.

89
00:12:23,615 --> 00:12:25,700
Boy, that guy sure likes to show off.

90
00:12:25,867 --> 00:12:28,662
Look what that wise guy
punched on my ticket.

91
00:12:29,037 --> 00:12:35,168
- "L-E." What the heck does that mean?
- Next stop, 11344 Edbrooke.

92
00:12:35,877 --> 00:12:38,380
We're heading for the other side
of the tracks.

93
00:12:55,313 --> 00:12:57,190
Well? You coming?

94
00:12:57,732 --> 00:12:59,108
Ah, it's just another pickup.

95
00:12:59,317 --> 00:13:02,737
That's weird. I thought you were
supposed to be the last one.

96
00:13:02,904 --> 00:13:05,114
Why, to the North Pole, of course.

97
00:13:05,323 --> 00:13:08,117
This is the Polar Express.

98
00:13:11,329 --> 00:13:13,289
Suit yourself.

99
00:13:41,859 --> 00:13:45,404
Hey, that kid wants
to get on the train.

100
00:13:46,197 --> 00:13:48,324
Come on!

101
00:13:50,534 --> 00:13:52,328
Hurry up!

102
00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:00,169
We have to stop the train.

103
00:14:00,378 --> 00:14:02,838
I don't know how.
- Pull the emergency brake!

104
00:14:32,826 --> 00:14:35,704
Who in the blazes applied
that emergency brake?!

105
00:14:35,913 --> 00:14:37,289
He did.

106
00:14:37,498 --> 00:14:39,208
You.

107
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:44,546
In case you didn't know, that cord
is for emergency purposes only.

108
00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:49,468
And in case you weren't aware,
tonight is Christmas Eve.

109
00:14:49,676 --> 00:14:53,722
And in case you hadn't noticed,
this train is on a very tight schedule.

110
00:14:53,931 --> 00:14:57,851
Now, young man, Christmas
may not be important to some people...

111
00:14:58,018 --> 00:15:01,480
...but it is very important
to the rest of us!

112
00:15:01,688 --> 00:15:03,148
But... But...

113
00:15:03,357 --> 00:15:06,902
He was just trying to stop the train
so that kid could get on.

114
00:15:07,527 --> 00:15:09,112
Hmm.

115
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,574
I see. Young man,
is that what happened?

116
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,039
Well...

117
00:15:19,372 --> 00:15:23,001
Let me remind you we are
on a very tight schedule.

118
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:25,420
And I've never been late before...

119
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:28,340
...and I am certainly not
going to be late tonight.

120
00:15:28,548 --> 00:15:32,511
Now, everybody, take your seats, please!

121
00:15:35,555 --> 00:15:37,474
Thank you.

122
00:15:41,478 --> 00:15:42,938
Your attention, please.

123
00:15:43,146 --> 00:15:47,609
Are there any Polar Express passengers
in need of refreshment?

124
00:15:47,817 --> 00:15:50,737
Me! Me! Me!
- I thought so.

125

You know, Montezuma,
the king of the Aztecs...

157
00:17:29,835 --> 00:17:33,380
...would drink 50 quarts
of hot chocolate every day.

158
00:17:33,589 --> 00:17:37,217
It was thick as mud and red.
He put chili pepper in instead of sugar.

159
00:17:37,426 --> 00:17:40,763
- Get it? Hot chocolate?
How do you know? That's not true.

160
00:17:40,929 --> 00:17:43,724
Where you going with that?
- It's for him.

161
00:17:43,932 --> 00:17:48,270
- I don't think we're to leave our seats.
- It's a violation of safety regulations...

162
00:17:48,479 --> 00:17:51,565
...for a kid to cross moving cars
without a grown-up.

163
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,317
I think I'll be okay.

164
00:17:53,525 --> 00:17:55,903
Are you sure?

165
00:18:04,786 --> 00:18:08,790
What about this lad in the back?
Did he get any refreshment?

166
00:18:08,957 --> 00:18:10,292
Uh-uh.

167
00:18:10,876 --> 00:18:13,086
Well, let's take some to him,
by all means.

168
00:18:17,049 --> 00:18:19,634
Watch your step, now. Watch your step.

169
00:18:21,219 --> 00:18:23,096
Uh-oh.

170
00:18:23,263 --> 00:18:24,765
She forgot her ticket.

171
00:18:24,973 --> 00:18:27,309
It hasn't been punched.

172
00:18:28,643 --> 00:18:31,313
Hey, what are you doing?
You're gonna get us all in trouble!

173
00:21:02,546 --> 00:21:05,424
Young lady, forgive me.

174
00:21:05,632 --> 00:21:09,136
I believe I have neglected
to punch your ticket.

175
00:21:09,344 --> 00:21:11,138
May I?

176
00:21:13,098 --> 00:21:16,101
I left my ticket right here on the seat.

177
00:21:16,727 --> 00:21:18,604
- But it's gone.
- You mean...

178
00:21:19,146 --> 00:21:21,023
...you have lost your ticket.

179
00:21:21,231 --> 00:21:23,108
She didn't lose her ticket.

180
00:21:24,234 --> 00:21:26,069
I did.

181
00:21:26,737 --> 00:21:29,781
I was trying to return it to you.

182
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:32,784
But the wind blew it out of my hand.

183
00:21:36,455 --> 00:21:37,664
You can have my ticket.

184
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:45,964
These tickets are not transferable.

185
00:21:46,715 --> 00:21:47,966
Young lady...

186
00:21:48,174 --> 00:21:51,219
...you will just have to
come along with me.

187
00:22:00,937 --> 00:22:04,691
You know what's gonna happen now?
He's gonna throw her off the train.

188
00:22:04,858 --> 00:22:07,819
Yeah, he's gonna probably throw her
right off the rear platform.

189
00:22:08,027 --> 00:22:11,531
Standard procedure. That way,
she won't get sucked under the wheels.

190
00:22:11,698 --> 00:22:14,951
They may slow the train down,
but they're never gonna stop it.

191
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,327
Stop it?

192
00:22:16,536 --> 00:22:19,330
That's it! I have to stop the train again.

193
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:21,749
No, please, don't do that again.

194
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:54,991
Where'd they go?

195
00:22:55,408 --> 00:22:57,076
What happened to them?

196
00:22:57,243 --> 00:23:00,204
Please, she's in big trouble.
You have to help me.

197
00:23:37,867 --> 00:23:39,493
Hey!

198
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:44,415
Hey!

199
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:48,294
I found your ticket! Wait!

200
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:52,256
Hey!

201
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:54,758
Wait!

202
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:57,344
I have your ticket!

203
00:24:33,755 --> 00:24:35,632
Is there something I can do for you?

204
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:37,801
I'm looking for a girl.

205
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,803
A gi...?

206
00:24:45,433 --> 00:24:47,394
Ain't we all?

207
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:50,063
I have her ticket.

208
00:24:50,272 --> 00:24:53,733
Well, lookie. Lookie here. What is this?

209
00:24:53,942 --> 00:24:58,488
This is an official, authentic,
genuine ticket to ride.

210
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:02,158
Oh, you better keep this
in a safe place, young man.

211
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:03,743
If I was you...

212
00:25:03,952 --> 00:25:06,621
I keep all my valuables right here.

213
00:25:06,788 --> 00:25:08,915
Right here in the old size 13.

214
00:25:09,124 --> 00:25:11,334
Experience shows
this is the safest place.

215
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:14,838
Not that I have much use for those.

216
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:16,256
Tickets.

217
00:25:16,464 --> 00:25:18,007
I ride for free.

218
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:23,012
Oh, yeah, yeah. I hop aboard this rattler
any time I feels like it.

219
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:25,223
I own this train. Oh, yeah.

220
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:29,852
It's like I'm the king of this train.
Yeah. The king of the Pol Ex.

221
00:25:30,061 --> 00:25:36,109
In fact, I am the king
of the North Pole!

222
00:25:37,902 --> 00:25:40,154
Oh, where's my manners? Sit, sit. Sit.

223
00:25:40,321 --> 00:25:41,990
Take a load off.

224
00:25:42,156 --> 00:25:44,492
Hey, would you like some Joe?

225
00:25:44,659 --> 00:25:50,206
Nice hot refreshment.
Perfect for a cold winter's night.

226
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:02,093
There. Bless you.

227
00:26:03,928 --> 00:26:06,222
What about Santa?

228
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:10,059
- Santa?
- Isn't he the king of the North Pole?

229
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:13,437
You mean this guy? Huh?

230
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:18,275
Ho-ho-ho, ho-ho-ho.

231
00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:33,249
What exactly is your persuasion
on the big man?

232
00:26:33,457 --> 00:26:34,750
Since you brought him up.

233
00:26:37,044 --> 00:26:39,088
Well, I...

234
00:26:39,296 --> 00:26:41,382
I want to believe.

235
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:45,302
- But...
- But you don't wanna be bamboozled.

236
00:26:45,469 --> 00:26:48,555
You don't wanna be
led down the primrose path.

237
00:26:48,722 --> 00:26:52,935
You don't wanna be conned or duped,
have the wool pulled over your eyes.

238
00:26:53,143 --> 00:26:57,231
Hoodwinked. You don't wanna be
taken for a ride, railroaded.

239
00:27:01,068 --> 00:27:04,113
Seeing is believing.

240
00:27:04,655 --> 00:27:06,073
Am I right?

241
00:27:07,157 --> 00:27:09,576
But what about this train?

242
00:27:11,245 --> 00:27:12,621
What about it?

243
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:15,749
We're all really going
to the North Pole...

244
00:27:15,916 --> 00:27:17,125
...aren't we?

245
00:27:17,417 --> 00:27:19,711
Aren't we?

246
00:27:20,671 --> 00:27:25,092
Are you saying
that this is all just a dream?

247
00:27:25,342 --> 00:27:28,887
You said it, kid. Not me.

248
00:27:31,348 --> 00:27:32,808
Ah.

249
00:27:33,016 --> 00:27:36,395
So let's go find that girl.

250
00:27:42,692 --> 00:27:44,778
One other thing.

251
00:27:46,029 --> 00:27:48,198
Do you believe in ghosts?

252
00:27:51,952 --> 00:27:53,787
Interesting.

253
00:27:56,456 --> 00:27:57,958
Wait.

254
00:28:00,377 --> 00:28:01,628
Wait!

255
00:28:08,551 --> 00:28:10,136
Wait!

256
00:28:15,141 --> 00:28:16,685
I have to wake up.

257
00:28:16,893 --> 00:28:18,895
Yeah. I have to wake up.

258
00:28:19,229 --> 00:28:22,482
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.

259
00:28:22,732 --> 00:28:24,901
Wake up!

260
00:28:27,403 --> 00:28:31,658
Wake up, wake up.
Wake up, wake up!

261
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,962
Kid!

262
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:46,339
Kid, get your head out of the clouds!

263
00:28:46,506 --> 00:28:48,049
Wake up, kid!

264
00:28:48,257 --> 00:28:52,011
There's no sleepwalking
on the Polar Express.

265
00:28:53,012 --> 00:28:54,847
We gotta jump them knuckles.

266
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,519
Come on, kid. Flip my shoulders.

267
00:28:59,685 --> 00:29:01,521
Grab my lily.

268
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:06,651
That skirt you're chasing
must have moved on ahead.

269
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,239
- We gotta hightail it to the hog, pronto.
- To the hog?

270
00:29:12,114 --> 00:29:15,409
The engine. The engine, you tenderfoot.

271
00:29:15,618 --> 00:29:18,788
We gotta make the engine
before we hit Flat Top Tunnel.

272
00:29:18,955 --> 00:29:20,623
How come?

273
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:23,417
So many questions.

274
00:29:23,876 --> 00:29:28,172
There is but one inch of clearance
between the roof of this rattler...

275
00:29:28,381 --> 00:29:31,217
...and the roof of Flat Top Tunnel.

276
00:29:31,384 --> 00:29:33,260
Savvy?

277
00:29:36,388 --> 00:29:39,433
It's just the run up to the hump, kid.

278
00:29:40,309 --> 00:29:41,936
This will be interesting.

279
00:30:05,167 --> 00:30:06,835
Get back on, kid. Hurry!

280
00:30:07,002 --> 00:30:09,296
Grab my muck stick.

281
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,501
There's only one trick to this, kid.

282
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,170
When I say "jump"...

283
00:30:52,631 --> 00:30:56,510
...you jump!

284
00:30:56,718 --> 00:30:58,553
Ah!

285
00:31:19,324 --> 00:31:22,494
You. I thought you got thrown off, and...

286
00:31:22,911 --> 00:31:25,705
- You're driving the train?
- They put me in charge.

287
00:31:25,914 --> 00:31:29,292
- The engineer had to check the light.
Here's the light. Careful.

288
00:31:29,501 --> 00:31:31,127
All right, now.

289
00:31:31,419 --> 00:31:34,130
- Oh!
- Oh! I got it.

290
00:31:37,509 --> 00:31:40,970
- How do you know how?
- It's easy. Come here, I'll show you.

291
00:31:41,179 --> 00:31:43,598
This big lever here, that's the throttle.

292
00:31:43,765 --> 00:31:45,892
This little one here, that's the brake.

293
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,937
And those are the pressure gauges.

294
00:31:49,103 --> 00:31:51,689
And that rope is the whistle.

295
00:31:52,357 --> 00:31:54,692
- The whistle.
- Mm-hm.

296
00:31:54,859 --> 00:31:56,778
You wanna try it?

297
00:31:59,614 --> 00:32:01,991
I've wanted to do that my whole life.

298
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,332
Hold still! Hold still! Don't move!

299
00:32:10,541 --> 00:32:11,542
Look!

300
00:32:23,804 --> 00:32:27,224
Stop the train! Stop the train!

301
00:32:28,309 --> 00:32:30,102
Stop the train!

302
00:32:33,064 --> 00:32:34,774
What?

303
00:32:34,982 --> 00:32:36,400
They want us to stop the train.

304
00:32:38,069 --> 00:32:40,237
- Which one is the brake?
- He told me this was.

305
00:32:40,404 --> 00:32:42,114
- Who?
- The engineer.

306
00:32:42,323 --> 00:32:46,911
- The engineer? This one looks like a brake.
- No, he said this was the brake.

307
00:32:47,077 --> 00:32:48,120
Are you sure?

308
00:32:48,496 --> 00:32:50,915
- Uh...
- Are you sure?

309
00:32:58,005 --> 00:33:00,716
Pull the brake!

310
00:33:00,925 --> 00:33:02,801
Stop the train!

311
00:33:20,194 --> 00:33:22,112
Caribou?

312
00:33:24,031 --> 00:33:26,241
- Ugh.
There's no Christmas...

313
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:28,535
...without the Polar Express
arriving on time.

314
00:33:28,702 --> 00:33:31,997
Am I the only one who understands that?

315
00:33:32,206 --> 00:33:34,958
You. I should have known.

316
00:33:35,125 --> 00:33:39,004
Are you bound and determined that
this train never reaches the North Pole?

317
00:33:39,212 --> 00:33:40,756
But look.

318
00:33:42,049 --> 00:33:43,592
Caribou crossing?!

319
00:33:44,551 --> 00:33:48,263
I make that herd to be at least
100,000, maybe even a million.

320
00:33:48,472 --> 00:33:51,516
It's gonna be hours
before they clear this track.

321
00:33:51,725 --> 00:33:55,729
- A tough nut to crack.
- We are in some serious jelly.

322
00:33:55,896 --> 00:33:58,356
- And a jam.
- Tight spot.

323
00:33:58,565 --> 00:33:59,858
- Up a creek.
- Up a tree.

324
00:34:00,066 --> 00:34:05,030
- Lost in the grass.
- I'll tell you what's grass: Our a... Ow!

325
00:34:45,695 --> 00:34:50,074
Problem solved. All ahead, slow.

326
00:35:35,995 --> 00:35:37,872
We're going pretty fast.

327
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,916
Tell the engineer to slow down.

328
00:35:46,297 --> 00:35:47,882
Slow it down.

329
00:35:49,759 --> 00:35:52,511
Watch the speed!

330
00:35:56,932 --> 00:36:00,603
Ah! Jumping jeepers,
the cotter pin sheared off.

331
00:36:00,769 --> 00:36:02,062
- What?
- The pin.

332
00:36:02,271 --> 00:36:04,398
- Where?
- There.

333
00:36:04,565 --> 00:36:06,108
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

334
00:36:07,151 --> 00:36:10,946
- They can't hear me.
- They can't? Oh...

335
00:36:13,407 --> 00:36:15,909
I don't like the look
of this. Quick, under the safety bar.

336
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,372
Is everything all right?
What should we do?

337
00:36:23,208 --> 00:36:24,668
Considering we've
lost communication with the engineer...

338
00:36:24,877 --> 00:36:28,088
...we are standing totally exposed
on the front of the locomotive...

339
00:36:28,255 --> 00:36:31,425
...the train appears to be
accelerating uncontrollably...

340
00:36:31,633 --> 00:36:35,429
...and we are rapidly
approaching Glacier Gulch...

341
00:36:35,637 --> 00:36:39,099
...which just happens to be the steepest
downhill grade in the world...

342
00:36:39,308 --> 00:36:42,561
...I suggest we all hold on...

343
00:36:43,145 --> 00:36:44,605
...tightly!

344
00:37:05,542 --> 00:37:07,377
- The pin.
- The pin.

345
00:37:27,105 --> 00:37:30,775
Jiminy Christmas, the ice has frozen
over the tracks.

346
00:37:53,214 --> 00:37:55,341
Hold on. Hold on. No, no.

347
00:37:56,301 --> 00:37:58,386
Come on. Watch your step.

348
00:37:58,553 --> 00:38:01,764
Come on, sweetie.
Up you go. Up you go.

349
00:38:02,974 --> 00:38:06,686
- Shh.
- Put your feet on here. On here.

350
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:10,523
Little adventure, huh?

351
00:38:10,732 --> 00:38:13,109
Young man, quick thinking on your part.

352
00:38:34,255 --> 00:38:36,966
Step to your left, please. To your left.

353
00:38:39,343 --> 00:38:40,636
Oh!

354
00:38:40,845 --> 00:38:44,306
Well, that is more like it.

355
00:38:46,684 --> 00:38:48,728
What in the name of Mike?

356
00:38:52,523 --> 00:38:53,983
Look.

357
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:59,363
Get us the blazes out of here!

358
00:39:07,621 --> 00:39:09,206
Turn this sled around.

359
00:39:27,725 --> 00:39:29,101
Look there.

360
00:39:31,812 --> 00:39:33,147
Tracks.

361
00:39:33,355 --> 00:39:34,731
Dead ahead.

362
00:39:40,571 --> 00:39:41,697
Right.

363
00:39:47,494 --> 00:39:48,537
Left.

364
00:39:54,001 --> 00:39:55,043
Right.

365
00:39:58,922 --> 00:40:00,173
Hang a Louie.

366
00:40:03,343 --> 00:40:04,678
Toss a Ritchie.

367
00:40:08,098 --> 00:40:09,724
Port astern.

368
00:40:11,935 --> 00:40:13,728
To the starboard.

369
00:40:15,063 --> 00:40:17,607
My slipper.
- You're gonna lose your ticket.

370
00:40:17,774 --> 00:40:19,651
It's not my ticket, it's yours.

371
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,653
- It's my ticket?
- Yes.

372
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:23,947
Right. Keep up with me. Left.

373
00:40:24,281 --> 00:40:26,700
Right. Left.

374
00:40:30,787 --> 00:40:32,080
Right.

375
00:40:32,455 --> 00:40:33,707
Left.

376
00:40:33,873 --> 00:40:35,250
Right.

377
00:40:35,458 --> 00:40:37,377
Left. Right.

378
00:40:41,131 --> 00:40:42,382
- Oh, no!
- Oh, no!

379
00:40:44,634 --> 00:40:46,428
Brace yourselves!

380
00:40:57,397 --> 00:40:59,315
Well, that's more like it.

381
00:41:01,734 --> 00:41:03,236
Thank you.

382
00:41:03,403 --> 00:41:06,698
Thank you. I can't believe
you found my ticket.

383
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,867
Did someone say they found a ticket?

384
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:15,289
Well, in that case... Tickets, please.

385
00:41:24,173 --> 00:41:25,716
Thank you.

386
00:41:27,426 --> 00:41:31,347
"L-E"?
- Hey, just like that know-it-all kid.

387
00:41:46,362 --> 00:41:47,697
Watch your step.

388
00:41:47,863 --> 00:41:51,158
Tricky walking up here. It's mighty slick.
Mighty slick, I tell you.

389
00:41:51,367 --> 00:41:55,204
Oh, whoop... There you go.
What did I tell you?

390
00:41:55,413 --> 00:42:00,501
Years ago, on my first Christmas Eve run,
I was up on the roof making my rounds...

391
00:42:00,709 --> 00:42:02,586
...when I slipped on the ice myself.

392
00:42:02,795 --> 00:42:06,173
I reached out for a hand iron,
but it broke off. I slid and fell.

393
00:42:06,382 --> 00:42:10,344
And yet, I did not fall off this train.

394
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:13,180
Someone saved you?

395
00:42:13,389 --> 00:42:15,349
Or something.

396
00:42:18,227 --> 00:42:19,520
An angel.

397
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:22,106
Maybe.

398
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:24,358
Wait. Wait.

399
00:42:25,234 --> 00:42:28,362
What did he look like? Did you see him?

400
00:42:29,488 --> 00:42:33,367
No, sir. But sometimes
seeing is believing.

401
00:42:33,742 --> 00:42:38,872
And sometimes the most real things
in the world are the things we can't see.

402
00:42:44,169 --> 00:42:47,047
Ah, the forsaken and the abandoned.

403
00:42:48,257 --> 00:42:52,219
Mind your step, now.
These poor toys have suffered enough...

404
00:42:52,427 --> 00:42:56,723
...being left to rust and decay in the
back alleys and vacant lots of the world.

405
00:42:57,266 --> 00:42:59,017
What are they doing here?

406
00:42:59,184 --> 00:43:01,395
It's a new concept
the boss came up with.

407
00:43:01,603 --> 00:43:04,940
Instead of being thrown away,
they're collected. Refurbished.

408
00:43:05,691 --> 00:43:10,737
He calls it "rebicycling. "
Something like that.

409
00:43:13,031 --> 00:43:15,408
Makes me wanna cry...

410
00:43:15,617 --> 00:43:18,745
...seeing toys that were
treated this way.

411
00:43:19,538 --> 00:43:21,623
These hopelessly entangled...

412
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:23,750
...string puppets and marionettes...

413
00:43:23,959 --> 00:43:28,213
...pose a particular problem. We found
the nimble fingers of our work force...

414
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:32,717
...here at the North Pole are best
for working out those knots and tangles.

415
00:43:32,926 --> 00:43:35,428
Thank you. Uh-oh.
Double-locked here.

416
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:50,276
You are just like me, my friend.

417
00:43:50,485 --> 00:43:52,821
- A scrooge!
- Ah!

418
00:43:52,987 --> 00:43:55,156
Ebenezer Scrooge.

419
00:43:55,323 --> 00:43:58,660
North Pole, Santa Claus, this train...

420
00:43:58,827 --> 00:44:02,747
...it's all a bunch of humbug.
A bout of indigestion.

421
00:44:02,914 --> 00:44:05,500
Oh, yeah. I know what you are.

422
00:44:05,667 --> 00:44:08,294
You're a doubter.

423
00:44:08,503 --> 00:44:11,005
A doubter. You don't believe!

424
00:44:11,214 --> 00:44:14,342
You're a doubter! You don't believe!

425
00:44:31,442 --> 00:44:34,362
Hey, you missed it.
We rode down some really sharp hills.

426
00:44:34,529 --> 00:44:36,197
We were on what looked like
a frozen lake.

427
00:44:36,364 --> 00:44:38,908
But I know it was just an optical illusion
caused by moonlight.

428
00:44:39,116 --> 00:44:41,994
He said the train was on ice.
But I said that's impossible...

429
00:44:42,203 --> 00:44:44,872
You can't put a train track...
Hey, where you going now?

430
00:44:57,885 --> 00:44:59,220
Shh.

431
00:44:59,387 --> 00:45:02,348
<i>I'm wishing on a star</i>

432
00:45:02,556 --> 00:45:05,684
<i>And trying to believe</i>

433
00:45:05,893 --> 00:45:09,021
<i>That even though it's far</i>

434
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:12,024
<i>He'll find me Christmas Eve</i>

435
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:15,778
<i>I guess that Santa's busy</i>

436
00:45:15,986 --> 00:45:18,948
<i>'Cause he's never come around</i>

437
00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:25,204
<i>I think of him
When Christmas comes to town</i>

438
00:45:26,038 --> 00:45:29,166
<i>The best time of the year</i>

439
00:45:29,333 --> 00:45:32,544
<i>When everyone comes home</i>

440
00:45:32,753 --> 00:45:35,881
<i>With all this Christmas cheer</i>

441
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:39,593
<i>It's hard to be alone</i>

442
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:45,808
<i>Putting up the Christmas tree
With friends who come around</i>

443
00:45:46,016 --> 00:45:52,356
<i>It's so much fun
When Christmas comes to town</i>

444
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:59,238
<i>Presents for the children
Wrapped in red and green</i>

445
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:05,577
<i>All the things I've heard about
But never really seen</i>

446
00:46:06,453 --> 00:46:08,914
<i>No one will be sleeping</i>

447
00:46:09,122 --> 00:46:12,167
<i>On the night of Christmas Eve</i>

448
00:46:12,376 --> 00:46:19,424
<i>Hoping Santa's on his way</i>

449
00:46:19,633 --> 00:46:22,677
<i>When Santa's sleighbells ring</i>

450
00:46:22,886 --> 00:46:25,722
<i>I listen all around</i>

451
00:46:25,889 --> 00:46:29,100
<i>The herald angels sing</i>

452
00:46:29,309 --> 00:46:32,270
<i>I never hear a sound</i>

453
00:46:32,812 --> 00:46:36,274
<i>And all the dreams of children</i>

454
00:46:36,483 --> 00:46:39,235
<i>Once lost will all be found</i>

455
00:46:39,402 --> 00:46:45,325
<i>That's all I want
When Christmas comes to town</i>

456
00:46:47,744 --> 00:46:56,377
<i>That's all I want
When Christmas comes to town</i>

457
00:47:07,931 --> 00:47:09,349
Look.

458
00:47:12,018 --> 00:47:14,020
The northern lights.

459
00:47:16,856 --> 00:47:18,900
Hey. You three.

460
00:47:20,109 --> 00:47:21,903
We just crossed it.

461
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:27,492
Latitude 66°33'.
The Arctic Circle.

462
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:30,995
And do you see?
Those lights in the distance.

463
00:47:31,954 --> 00:47:36,375
They look like the lights of a strange
ocean liner sailing on a frozen sea.

464
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:39,670
There...

465
00:47:40,379 --> 00:47:42,381
...is the North Pole.

466
00:47:47,386 --> 00:47:50,223
<i>It's a magic carpet on a rail
It never takes a rest</i>

467
00:47:50,389 --> 00:47:53,559
<i>Flying through
The mountains and the snow</i>

468
00:47:53,726 --> 00:47:56,687
<i>You can ride for free and join the fun
If you just say yes</i>

469
00:47:56,896 --> 00:48:00,191
<i>'Cause that's the way things happen
On the Polar Express</i>

470
00:48:00,399 --> 00:48:03,486
<i>Whoo, whoo, the whistle blows
That's the sound of her singing</i>

471
00:48:03,652 --> 00:48:06,864
<i>Ding, ding, the bell will ring
Golly, look at her go</i>

472
00:48:07,073 --> 00:48:10,034
<i>You wonder if you'll get there soon
Anybody's guess</i>

473
00:48:10,242 --> 00:48:13,412
<i>'Cause that's the way things happen
On the Polar Express</i>

474
00:48:13,579 --> 00:48:16,707
<i>When we get there
We'll scream, "Yay!"</i>

475
00:48:16,916 --> 00:48:19,210
<i>We'll arrive with
A bang, bang, bang</i>

476
00:48:19,418 --> 00:48:22,379
<i>Boom, boom, boom
Laughing all the way</i>

477
00:48:27,426 --> 00:48:30,304
We made it. With five minutes to spare.

478
00:48:30,512 --> 00:48:31,847
We made it.

479
00:48:57,789 --> 00:49:00,083
There should be elves.
Where are the elves?

480
00:49:00,292 --> 00:49:01,919
Yeah, where are the elves?

481
00:49:02,127 --> 00:49:04,421
They are gathering
in the center of the city.

482
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:08,383
That is where Santa will give
the first gift of Christmas.

483
00:49:09,301 --> 00:49:11,720
Who gets the first gift of Christmas?

484
00:49:11,887 --> 00:49:15,766
He will choose one of you.

485
00:49:18,810 --> 00:49:21,772
- Look.
- Elves!

486
00:49:52,677 --> 00:49:54,971
All right. All right,
ladies and gentlemen.

487
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:57,849
Two columns, if you please.

488
00:49:58,016 --> 00:50:00,810
Shorter in the front, taller in the rear.

489
00:50:01,352 --> 00:50:04,939
Even-numbered birthdays on the right,
odd-numbered on the left.

490
00:50:05,106 --> 00:50:08,026
No pushing. No pushing.
But let's not dilly-dally.

491
00:50:08,193 --> 00:50:10,111
It's five minutes to midnight.

492
00:50:10,278 --> 00:50:13,865
Hey, what gives? It was five minutes
till midnight four minutes ago.

493
00:50:14,365 --> 00:50:16,826
Exactly. Columns of two.

494
00:50:17,035 --> 00:50:19,120
- One, two.
Excuse me.

495
00:50:19,287 --> 00:50:21,748
- Question.
- What about him?

496
00:50:24,542 --> 00:50:27,211
No one is required to see Santa.

497
00:50:28,379 --> 00:50:31,549
Ladies and gentlemen,
you do not have to hold hands...

498
00:50:31,716 --> 00:50:35,178
- Come on.
... but please remain in your columns...

499
00:50:35,386 --> 00:50:37,722
...while we are in transit.

500
00:50:47,398 --> 00:50:50,860
- Look, you have to come with us.
- She's right.

501
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:57,241
Christmas just doesn't work out
for me. Never has.

502
00:50:57,408 --> 00:51:00,036
But Christmas is such a wonderful,
beautiful time.

503
00:51:00,244 --> 00:51:03,831
It's a time for giving and being thankful,
for friends and family.

504
00:51:03,998 --> 00:51:08,794
People hang decorations and lights. Santa
leaves presents under our Christmas trees.

505
00:51:10,755 --> 00:51:12,465
Christmas just...

506
00:51:13,090 --> 00:51:14,925
...doesn't work out for me.

507
00:51:16,761 --> 00:51:20,431
Look, I don't know if Christmas
is gonna work out for you or not...

508
00:51:20,598 --> 00:51:23,726
...but this is Christmas Eve.
Don't stay here by yourself.

509
00:51:25,436 --> 00:51:26,937
Yes, come with us.

510
00:51:27,521 --> 00:51:29,273
We'll go together.

511
00:51:41,368 --> 00:51:42,995
Oh, no.
Uh-oh.

512
00:51:51,045 --> 00:51:52,921
We're gonna be okay.

513
00:51:55,299 --> 00:51:57,384
Maybe not!

514
00:51:59,303 --> 00:52:01,221
The emergency brake.

515
00:52:01,388 --> 00:52:03,348
The emergency brake.

516
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:10,856
There's no brake. I can't find the brake!

517
00:52:17,404 --> 00:52:19,948
Take a break, kid.

518
00:52:20,157 --> 00:52:23,785
How about a nice, good hot cup of Joe?

519
00:52:52,439 --> 00:52:53,481
We're gonna crash!

520
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:02,407
We're spinning.

521
00:53:26,723 --> 00:53:30,143
Shh. You hear that?

522
00:53:30,727 --> 00:53:32,020
The bell.

523
00:53:33,396 --> 00:53:35,773
What bell?
- The sleighbell.

524
00:53:35,982 --> 00:53:38,359
- Sleighbell?
- Don't you hear it?

525
00:53:39,736 --> 00:53:42,238
It's coming from that tunnel.

526
00:53:47,827 --> 00:53:49,912
That's the way we should go.

527
00:53:58,421 --> 00:53:59,922
Come on.

528
00:54:17,606 --> 00:54:20,025
Oh.

529
00:54:32,121 --> 00:54:33,706
What?

530
00:54:34,206 --> 00:54:36,625
- What?
- Come on.

531
00:54:48,887 --> 00:54:49,888
Come on.

532
00:54:59,731 --> 00:55:01,483
We're lost.

533
00:55:11,493 --> 00:55:12,870
Yes.

534
00:55:14,162 --> 00:55:17,040
- Yes. I hear it.
I hear it too.

535
00:55:17,249 --> 00:55:21,295
- I don't hear anything.
- Okay, it's down this way.

536
00:55:21,503 --> 00:55:22,671
Are you sure?

537
00:55:27,259 --> 00:55:28,593
Absolutely.

538
00:55:34,266 --> 00:55:36,726
- Why can't I hear anything?
- Shh.

539
00:55:39,354 --> 00:55:40,897
Get down and be quiet.

540
00:55:51,116 --> 00:55:55,245
Yeah. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

541
00:55:55,453 --> 00:55:56,955
Okay.

542
00:55:57,872 --> 00:56:00,000
Well, that was the wrapping hall, chief.

543
00:56:00,208 --> 00:56:02,752
- Just finished the last one.
How's it wrapped?

544
00:56:02,961 --> 00:56:06,840
It's wrapped in candy-striped red
with a number-seven holly-green bow.

545
00:56:07,048 --> 00:56:10,301
A number-seven bow?
When we're this close to liftoff?

546
00:56:10,468 --> 00:56:13,930
What are they thinking down there?
Are they meshuggener?

547
00:56:14,139 --> 00:56:16,349
- What's the routing?
- Going to the States.

548
00:56:16,558 --> 00:56:18,101
Grand Rapids, Michigan.

549
00:56:19,978 --> 00:56:21,980
That's my town. I'm from Grand Rapids.

550
00:56:27,569 --> 00:56:30,613
We got a troublemaker
now. Just what we need.

551
00:56:30,822 --> 00:56:33,700
Things aren't bad enough.
What's his 20?

552
00:56:33,908 --> 00:56:37,161
Apparently, some kid
from Maplewood, New Jersey...

553
00:56:37,328 --> 00:56:39,747
...stuck some gum in his sister's hair.

554
00:56:40,331 --> 00:56:43,418
New Jersey? Is that
the same kid that put the tack...

555
00:56:43,584 --> 00:56:45,712
...underneath his teacher's chair
last year?

556
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:49,507
- No, sir. This kid's name is Steven.
- Steven.

557
00:56:50,007 --> 00:56:52,969
So, what do we do, chief?
Alert the big man?

558
00:56:53,177 --> 00:56:56,139
We talking nothing for Christmas here?

559
00:57:05,106 --> 00:57:06,857
<i>I didn't do it.</i>

560
00:57:07,024 --> 00:57:08,776
<i>I didn't do it.</i>

561
00:57:11,112 --> 00:57:13,572
Look, it's...
It's almost Christmas, huh?

562
00:57:14,198 --> 00:57:16,075
We'll cut the kid a break.

563
00:57:16,283 --> 00:57:18,285
But put him on the check-twice list
for next year.

564
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:21,205
All right, boys.

565
00:57:21,455 --> 00:57:24,500
Let's shut it down, all right.
That's it for this year. Come on.

566
00:57:24,709 --> 00:57:29,213
- Hey, boss, are we taking the pneumatic?
- Of course we're taking the pneumatic.

567
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:32,550
It's the only way to get
to the square on time.

568
00:57:32,716 --> 00:57:35,970
- Let's go.
And time is money.

569
00:57:36,637 --> 00:57:39,348
Ready, and mount.

570
00:57:40,808 --> 00:57:43,477
Good. Close.

571
00:57:57,991 --> 00:57:59,827
All right, get in.

572
00:58:01,328 --> 00:58:03,414
I don't know about this.

573
00:58:38,365 --> 00:58:41,159
I don't hear it. Do you?

574
00:58:42,536 --> 00:58:44,121
No.

575
00:58:45,789 --> 00:58:48,250
I think we should follow those arrows.

576
00:59:02,555 --> 00:59:04,975
I thought there'd be a way out.

577
00:59:05,141 --> 00:59:06,726
We're gonna miss everything.

578
00:59:17,404 --> 00:59:18,988
Hey, look.

579
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:21,991
A present.

580
00:59:26,329 --> 00:59:29,332
It's going to my town.
To someone named Billy.

581
00:59:29,499 --> 00:59:35,088
- My name is Billy.
- It's going to 11344 Edbrooke Avenue.

582
00:59:35,255 --> 00:59:37,131
That's my address.

583
00:59:44,931 --> 00:59:46,516
Come on.

584
01:00:46,575 --> 01:00:48,035
Look.

585
01:00:49,411 --> 01:00:52,873
It says, "Merry Christmas, Billy.
From Mr. C."

586
01:00:53,916 --> 01:00:58,253
I think I know what it is.
I wanted one of these my whole life.

587
01:00:59,254 --> 01:01:01,548
Wait, wait. Stop. Look.

588
01:01:03,676 --> 01:01:05,761
But I...

589
01:01:05,928 --> 01:01:07,763
Those are the rules.

590
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:07,215
Ah!

591
01:03:08,716 --> 01:03:10,343
Something's got me.

592
01:03:10,551 --> 01:03:12,220
It's got my leg.

593
01:03:12,803 --> 01:03:14,138
I can't hold him.

594
01:03:14,722 --> 01:03:17,600
Give me your other hand.
Give me your other hand.

595
01:03:17,975 --> 01:03:20,311
- I can't.
- On three.

596
01:03:20,478 --> 01:03:23,606
One, two, three.

597
01:03:24,398 --> 01:03:26,359
- Look.
- It's still got me.

598
01:03:26,567 --> 01:03:29,862
On three again. One, two, three.

599
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:34,700
- You.
- You.

600
01:03:34,909 --> 01:03:36,911
- What are you doing here?
- Same as you.

601
01:03:37,078 --> 01:03:40,664
Checking out my presents. Making sure
I'm getting everything on my list.

602
01:03:40,831 --> 01:03:43,751
All I found was one present.
All it had was stupid underwear.

603
01:03:43,918 --> 01:03:45,544
Look.

604
01:03:54,094 --> 01:03:56,305
<i>You may start
your descent any time now.</i>

605
01:03:56,513 --> 01:03:58,724
<i>At your convenience, of course.</i>

606
01:04:10,944 --> 01:04:14,323
It's still five to.
I think we're gonna make it.

607
01:04:14,531 --> 01:04:17,117
Of course we will. It's been five to
for the last hour.

608
01:04:17,284 --> 01:04:20,871
We got plenty of time. We got nothing
but time. We got time to kill.

609
01:04:21,038 --> 01:04:24,791
You know what?
I don't think we're gonna make it.

610
01:04:27,211 --> 01:04:30,339
I may be just an old railroader...

611
01:04:30,547 --> 01:04:33,300
...and know nothing about
lighter-than-air craft...

612
01:04:33,467 --> 01:04:38,972
...but from my layman's perspective,
you need more altitude!

613
01:04:39,139 --> 01:04:41,600
More altitude!

614
01:04:42,309 --> 01:04:45,270
<i>Altitude, please.
A bit more altitude, please.</i>

615
01:04:46,313 --> 01:04:48,440
Geronimo!

616
01:05:03,830 --> 01:05:05,332
The Flying Elves.

617
01:05:05,498 --> 01:05:08,293
They are specialists.
Do not try that at home, kids.

618
01:05:08,501 --> 01:05:10,420
Do not try that at home.

619
01:05:10,587 --> 01:05:11,838
We're not gonna make it.

620
01:05:52,128 --> 01:05:53,713
A well-oiled machine.

621
01:05:54,297 --> 01:05:55,590
Whew.

622
01:06:03,556 --> 01:06:06,350
All right, you stowaways.

623
01:06:06,809 --> 01:06:09,937
- Party's over.
- I was just following them.

624
01:06:10,146 --> 01:06:12,023
We fell in here by mistake.

625
01:06:12,231 --> 01:06:15,902
Ah, forget about it. We knew you
was in there the whole time.

626
01:06:17,820 --> 01:06:19,197
Come on, out you go.

627
01:06:19,405 --> 01:06:23,075
Let's go, come on.
Step up, step up. There we go.

628
01:06:23,242 --> 01:06:26,495
Not a problem. Come on.
Watch your step. There you go.

629
01:06:32,418 --> 01:06:35,713
So nobody gets hurt, here's
how we're gonna get you guys down.

630
01:06:35,921 --> 01:06:39,216
- This is simple. Why, I know...
- What do you know?

631
01:06:39,592 --> 01:06:43,054
You're not supposed to be here
in the first place.

632
01:06:43,429 --> 01:06:47,683
But since it's Christmas,
I'm gonna let you slide.

633
01:06:47,850 --> 01:06:49,477
Hey. Ow.

634
01:06:51,437 --> 01:06:52,771
Been looking for you.

635
01:06:55,941 --> 01:06:57,276
There you go.

636
01:06:57,443 --> 01:06:58,694
Watch your step.

637
01:06:58,861 --> 01:07:00,779
Careful.

638
01:07:00,946 --> 01:07:03,032
Beautiful form. Beautiful.

639
01:07:03,198 --> 01:07:05,576
Nice to see you again.

640
01:07:07,453 --> 01:07:10,205
Cutting it kind of close, aren't we?

641
01:07:10,372 --> 01:07:13,959
- I'll take care of this.
- Uh-uh.

642
01:07:14,126 --> 01:07:16,253
It's in good hands.

643
01:07:16,462 --> 01:07:19,131
Trust me.

644
01:07:47,492 --> 01:07:51,121
<i>It's the spirit of the season</i>

645
01:07:51,330 --> 01:07:54,833
<i>You can feel it in the air</i>

646
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,754
<i>You can hear it if you listen</i>

647
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:02,591
<i>Everywhere
So much care</i>

648
01:08:02,757 --> 01:08:04,468
<i>Like a prayer</i>

649
01:08:04,676 --> 01:08:08,305
<i>Whatever it is
You need to share it</i>

650
01:08:08,513 --> 01:08:13,643
<i>It's the spirit of the season</i>

651
01:08:23,194 --> 01:08:28,158
<i>It's the spirit of the season</i>

652
01:08:32,704 --> 01:08:37,041
<i>You can feel it in the air</i>

653
01:08:50,471 --> 01:08:53,558
Aren't those bells
the most beautiful sound?

654
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:11,302
He's here! He's here!

655
01:10:11,468 --> 01:10:12,720
Where?

656
01:10:12,886 --> 01:10:15,264
I see him. He's over there.

657
01:10:15,472 --> 01:10:16,932
I can't see him.

658
01:10:37,161 --> 01:10:39,121
I can't see him.

659
01:10:39,329 --> 01:10:42,082
I can't see him!

660
01:11:44,727 --> 01:11:48,189
<i>Doubter. Doubter.</i>

661
01:11:51,818 --> 01:11:53,236
Okay.

662
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:56,239
Okay.

663
01:11:58,741 --> 01:12:00,952
I believe.

664
01:12:02,078 --> 01:12:04,998
I believe.

665
01:12:06,833 --> 01:12:09,127
I believe.

666
01:12:34,110 --> 01:12:36,404
What was that you said?

667
01:12:40,700 --> 01:12:43,577
I... I believe.

668
01:12:47,915 --> 01:12:49,917
I believe.

669
01:12:51,794 --> 01:12:55,965
I... I believe that this is yours.

670
01:12:57,716 --> 01:12:59,260
Well...

671
01:13:01,137 --> 01:13:02,346
Thank you.

672
01:13:02,513 --> 01:13:05,766
Me, me. Pick me, Santa.
What are you doing? Stop it.

673
01:13:05,975 --> 01:13:09,019
- Pick me, pick me. I want the first gift.
Hush.

674
01:13:09,228 --> 01:13:11,146
Young man...

675
01:13:11,355 --> 01:13:13,148
...patience.

676
01:13:13,315 --> 01:13:17,987
And a smidgen of humility
might also serve you well.

677
01:13:18,153 --> 01:13:19,780
Yes, sir.

678
01:13:21,156 --> 01:13:23,409
And you, young lady...

679
01:13:23,575 --> 01:13:25,285
A lady of decision.

680
01:13:25,452 --> 01:13:29,373
Full of confidence and spirit.

681
01:13:30,124 --> 01:13:31,750
Christmas spirit.

682
01:13:31,917 --> 01:13:34,420
Ho-ho-ho.

683
01:13:34,586 --> 01:13:36,130
Keep up the good work.

684
01:13:37,589 --> 01:13:39,174
Thank you.

685
01:13:40,175 --> 01:13:41,760
And Billy.

686
01:13:43,262 --> 01:13:44,972
It is Billy?

687
01:13:46,807 --> 01:13:49,351
I see you've made some new friends.

688
01:13:52,062 --> 01:13:53,605
Yes, sir. I sure have.

689
01:13:54,106 --> 01:13:56,024
That's a lucky lad.

690
01:13:56,191 --> 01:13:58,652
There's no greater gift than friendship.

691
01:14:01,697 --> 01:14:04,574
And speaking of gifts...

692
01:14:09,037 --> 01:14:10,872
...let's have this young fellow
right here.

693
01:14:48,993 --> 01:14:50,578
Now...

694
01:14:50,745 --> 01:14:53,748
...what would you like for Christmas?

695
01:14:53,915 --> 01:14:55,792
Me.

696
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,377
You.

697
01:15:11,933 --> 01:15:14,727
Yes. Indeed.

698
01:15:15,269 --> 01:15:17,397
Hm.

699
01:15:17,563 --> 01:15:20,066
Yes, indeed.

700
01:15:26,906 --> 01:15:30,660
The first gift of Christmas!

701
01:15:45,174 --> 01:15:48,970
This bell is a wonderful symbol
of the spirit of Christmas...

702
01:15:49,136 --> 01:15:51,055
...as am I.

703
01:15:53,516 --> 01:15:55,017
Just remember...

704
01:15:55,226 --> 01:15:57,937
...the true spirit of Christmas...

705
01:15:58,145 --> 01:16:00,439
...lies in your heart.

706
01:16:11,992 --> 01:16:13,786
Merry Christmas.

707
01:16:15,871 --> 01:16:18,666
Better keep that in a safe place.

708
01:16:34,348 --> 01:16:35,808
Oh.

709
01:16:38,602 --> 01:16:43,440
Hey, hey. Man alive, are you lucky.

710
01:16:54,368 --> 01:16:56,995
Ho-ho-ho.

711
01:17:05,712 --> 01:17:08,298
Pull, Comet. Pull, boy!

712
01:17:11,468 --> 01:17:13,678
Prancer, that's a girl.

713
01:17:18,308 --> 01:17:20,560
Good boy, Donder.

714
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:38,161
Oh, ho-ho-ho.

715
01:17:52,383 --> 01:17:56,679
Now, Dasher. Now, Prancer and Vixen.

716
01:18:05,522 --> 01:18:08,608
It's everything I dreamed it would be.

717
01:18:08,775 --> 01:18:10,568
Could all...?

718
01:18:10,777 --> 01:18:13,696
Could all this be nothing but a dream?

719
01:18:13,863 --> 01:18:15,406
No.

720
01:18:27,710 --> 01:18:30,129
<i>To the top of the roof
To the top of the wall</i>

721
01:18:30,296 --> 01:18:35,134
<i>Now, dash away, dash away
Dash away all</i>

722
01:19:07,666 --> 01:19:10,503
All aboard!

723
01:19:10,669 --> 01:19:12,588
One, two. One, two, three, go.

724
01:19:12,755 --> 01:19:16,634
<i>Rockin ' on top of the world
Rockin ' on top of the world</i>

725
01:19:16,842 --> 01:19:18,969
<i>The place is hoppin '
There ain't no stoppin '</i>

726
01:19:19,178 --> 01:19:23,015
<i>Rockin ' on top of the world
Lift your spirits, swing that girl</i>

727
01:19:23,182 --> 01:19:25,851
<i>Rockin ' on top of the world
Tonight, yeah</i>

728
01:19:26,018 --> 01:19:28,354
Come on, shorty!

729
01:19:41,450 --> 01:19:43,827
Show your tickets.
Have your tickets ready.

730
01:19:43,994 --> 01:19:46,538
Remember to eat
the five basic food groups.

731
01:19:46,705 --> 01:19:48,499
Ticket, please.

732
01:19:48,665 --> 01:19:51,960
And please brush after every meal.

733
01:19:55,047 --> 01:19:58,300
Remember to duck and
cover. All right, you. Ticket, please.

734
01:20:07,225 --> 01:20:09,770
"Lean. " Whatever that's
supposed to mean.

735
01:20:09,978 --> 01:20:12,230
"Lean" is spelled with four letters.

736
01:20:12,397 --> 01:20:14,649
I believed I punched five.

737
01:20:16,902 --> 01:20:19,696
Hey, are you saying
I don't know how to...?

738
01:20:19,905 --> 01:20:23,116
Oh, I'm sorry. It says "learn. "
My mistake.

739
01:20:23,325 --> 01:20:25,202
Lesson learned.

740
01:20:25,410 --> 01:20:26,745
Ticket.

741
01:20:43,511 --> 01:20:45,055
That is some special ticket.

742
01:20:45,263 --> 01:20:46,723
Sure is.

743
01:20:46,931 --> 01:20:51,186
So can you count on us
to get you home safe and sound?

744
01:20:53,271 --> 01:20:55,023
Absolutely.

745
01:20:55,190 --> 01:20:56,691
Me...

746
01:20:57,984 --> 01:20:59,986
...and my friends.

747
01:21:02,781 --> 01:21:03,948
Ticket.

748
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:15,585
It says "lead. " Like "lead balloon. "

749
01:21:15,752 --> 01:21:18,463
I believe it also is pronounced "lead. "

750
01:21:18,630 --> 01:21:20,548
As in "leader," "leadership. "

751
01:21:20,715 --> 01:21:22,925
"Lead the way. "

752
01:21:23,134 --> 01:21:25,303
Follow you anywhere, ma'am.

753
01:21:28,222 --> 01:21:29,474
Ah, yes.

754
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:32,602
Young man with all the questions.

755
01:21:33,144 --> 01:21:34,520
Ticket.

756
01:21:44,572 --> 01:21:46,782
- It says...
- Don't...

757
01:21:47,033 --> 01:21:48,659
It's nothing I need to know.

758
01:21:59,670 --> 01:22:02,006
- Come on, let's see the bell.
Let's see it.

759
01:22:02,173 --> 01:22:04,884
Come on, let's see the bell.
- Show us the bell.

760
01:22:05,092 --> 01:22:07,219
Yeah, let's see the bell.

761
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:16,228
It's gone.

762
01:22:17,521 --> 01:22:20,316
Where is it?
- I lost it.

763
01:22:20,524 --> 01:22:23,068
I lost the bell from Santa's sleigh.

764
01:22:23,277 --> 01:22:25,070
It's gone?

765
01:22:26,447 --> 01:22:27,740
Don't worry.

766
01:22:27,948 --> 01:22:30,326
- We'll... We'll find it.
Yeah, we'll find it.

767
01:22:30,534 --> 01:22:32,828
Yeah, we'll help you. All of us.

768
01:22:33,037 --> 01:22:35,831
Yeah, let's hurry out
and find it right now.

769
01:22:45,382 --> 01:22:47,092
It's too late.

770
01:22:48,635 --> 01:22:51,096
Gee, that's really too bad.

771
01:22:52,139 --> 01:22:53,766
Really.

772
01:23:08,322 --> 01:23:10,115
I'm sorry.

773
01:23:41,021 --> 01:23:44,983
<i>11344 Edbrooke.</i>

774
01:23:45,191 --> 01:23:50,614
Next stop, 11344 Edbrooke.

775
01:23:57,954 --> 01:23:59,831
Hey, where you going?

776
01:24:00,874 --> 01:24:01,958
Home.

777
01:24:02,125 --> 01:24:05,712
Oh, okay. Merry Christmas.

778
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:13,678
Thanks for stopping the train for me.

779
01:24:19,559 --> 01:24:21,144
Have a wonderful Christmas.

780
01:24:23,229 --> 01:24:25,732
Watch your step, please.

781
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:29,360
And merry Christmas.

782
01:24:46,377 --> 01:24:47,670
Look.

783
01:24:50,339 --> 01:24:53,217
Santa got to Billy's house already.

784
01:24:56,012 --> 01:24:58,764
Look, look! Santa got here!

785
01:24:58,931 --> 01:25:00,516
Isn't that amazing?

786
01:25:00,683 --> 01:25:02,101
It is amazing.

787
01:25:09,525 --> 01:25:11,610
It is amazing.

788
01:25:57,990 --> 01:26:00,242
I'm sorry about the bell.

789
01:26:00,868 --> 01:26:03,495
It was a really special present.

790
01:26:03,662 --> 01:26:05,414
Well, you know what they say.

791
01:26:05,581 --> 01:26:07,875
It's the thought that counts.

792
01:26:08,584 --> 01:26:10,002
Yeah.

793
01:26:11,169 --> 01:26:14,047
Well, see you.

794
01:26:16,675 --> 01:26:18,176
Well...

795
01:26:18,844 --> 01:26:20,429
...see you.

796
01:26:21,346 --> 01:26:22,806
See you.

797
01:26:36,611 --> 01:26:39,114
Watch your step, please.

798
01:26:40,365 --> 01:26:41,616
Thank you.

799
01:26:41,783 --> 01:26:44,327
No, thank you.

800
01:26:46,121 --> 01:26:47,873
One thing about trains:

801
01:26:48,039 --> 01:26:50,125
It doesn't matter where they're going.

802
01:26:50,292 --> 01:26:54,337
What matters is deciding to get on.

803
01:27:11,312 --> 01:27:12,814
Merry Christmas!

804
01:27:16,526 --> 01:27:17,735
What?

805
01:27:18,903 --> 01:27:23,408
Merry Christmas!

806
01:28:31,976 --> 01:28:36,313
Wake up. Wake up.
Santa's been here. Santa's been here.

807
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:38,148
Hurry up. Hurry up!

808
01:28:38,315 --> 01:28:41,652
Mom, Dad, wake up. Wake up!

809
01:28:41,819 --> 01:28:44,822
Santa's been here! Santa's been here!

810
01:28:44,989 --> 01:28:48,909
Mom, Dad, look!
He brought us all kinds of stuff!

811
01:28:49,076 --> 01:28:51,620
Look, a train!

812
01:29:08,053 --> 01:29:13,517
This is the most beautiful-est,
most wonderful-est Christmas ever.

813
01:29:13,725 --> 01:29:15,978
Wait. Look.

814
01:29:17,271 --> 01:29:19,147
Here's one more.

815
01:29:20,691 --> 01:29:22,567
Has your name on it.

816
01:29:51,471 --> 01:29:53,974
<i>Found this on the seat of my sleigh.</i>

817
01:29:54,140 --> 01:29:56,810
<i>Better fix that hole in your pocket.</i>

818
01:29:57,018 --> 01:29:58,228
<i>Mr. C.</i>

819
01:30:09,406 --> 01:30:11,533
Oh, what a beautiful bell.
Who's it from?

820
01:30:11,700 --> 01:30:13,743
- Santa.
- Santa?

821
01:30:13,910 --> 01:30:15,537
Really?

822
01:30:16,579 --> 01:30:18,998
- Oh, that's too bad.
What's this?

823
01:30:20,041 --> 01:30:22,502
Broken. Huh?

824
01:30:22,669 --> 01:30:24,838
Sorry about that, sport.

825
01:30:29,384 --> 01:30:32,512
Come on, kids.
We don't wanna be late.

826
01:30:40,603 --> 01:30:44,065
<i>At one time,
most of my friends could hear the bell.</i>

827
01:30:44,273 --> 01:30:48,277
<i>But as years passed,
it fell silent for all of them.</i>

828
01:30:48,444 --> 01:30:53,741
<i>Even Sarah found, one Christmas, that she
could no longer hear its sweet sound.</i>

829
01:30:53,908 --> 01:30:55,576
<i>Though I've grown old...</i>

830
01:30:55,785 --> 01:30:58,121
<i>...the bell still rings for me.</i>

831
01:30:58,287 --> 01:31:02,375
<i>As it does for all who truly believe.</i>
