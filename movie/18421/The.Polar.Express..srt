I did not rustle the sheets.

5

我p慢的呼吸著
I breathed slowly and silently.

6

He said Santa would have to
fly faster than light...

12
00:02:52,308 --> 00:02:56,306
才能在一晚上跑遍每人的家K
...to get to every house in one night.
And to hold everyone's presents...

13
00:02:56,312 --> 00:02:59,159
而且如果他要送Y物o大家
那他的雪橇一定要比大船要大
...his sled would be bigger
than an ocean liner.

14
00:02:59,215 --> 00:03:03,379
唉，那是哥哥在跟你_玩笑
