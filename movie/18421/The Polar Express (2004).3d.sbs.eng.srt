1
00:00:44,814 --> 00:00:47,783
On Christmas Eve, 
many years ago...

2
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,384
...I lay quietly in my bed.

3
00:00:50,553 --> 00:00:52,919
I did not rustle the sheets.

4
00:00:53,088 --> 00:00:56,353
I breathed slowly and silently.

5
00:00:56,525 --> 00:01:02,259
I was listening for a sound
I was afraid I'd never hear.

6
00:01:02,598 --> 00:01:07,695
The ringing bells of Santa 's sleigh.

7
00:02:35,724 --> 00:02:39,319
All right. All right, Sarah,
you had your water.

8
00:02:39,495 --> 00:02:41,554
Now let's get you upstairs
and into bed.

9
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,324
But-- But-- But, I have to--

10
00:02:47,002 --> 00:02:49,800
He said Santa would have to
fly faster than light...

11
00:02:49,972 --> 00:02:53,806
to get to every house in one night.
And to hold everyone's presents...

12
00:02:53,976 --> 00:02:56,706
...his sled would be bigger
than an ocean liner.

13
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,872
Your brother said that?. 
He was just kidding you. 
He knows there's a Santa.

14
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:04,713
He said he wasn't sure.
He wasn't sure if Santa was for real.

15
00:03:04,887 --> 00:03:07,913
Of course Santa is real.
He's as real as Christmas itself.

16
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:11,719
But he won't come until you're
sound asleep, young lady.

17
00:03:12,728 --> 00:03:14,559
Sweet dreams.

18
00:03:15,431 --> 00:03:17,729
Santa will be here before you know it.

19
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,891
So go to sleep.

20
00:04:04,546 --> 00:04:06,776
""Stark, barren.

21
00:04:09,985 --> 00:04:12,476
Decoid of life.""

22
00:04:23,481 --> 00:04:25,745
He's gotta be asleep by now.

23
00:04:25,917 --> 00:04:29,944
He used to stay awake all night
waiting for Santa.

24
00:04:30,355 --> 00:04:33,688
Think those days are just about over.

25
00:04:33,858 --> 00:04:35,792
That would be sad if that were true.

26
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,452
Yeah, an end of the magic.

27
00:04:40,899 --> 00:04:43,197
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

28
00:04:50,675 --> 00:04:52,438
See, he's out like a light.

29
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:55,773
An express train
wouldn't wake him up now.

30
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:01,484
""End of the magic ""?

31
00:07:13,017 --> 00:07:16,851
All aboard!

32
00:07:20,091 --> 00:07:24,027
All aboard!

33
00:07:51,756 --> 00:07:54,384
Well?. You coming?.

34
00:07:55,693 --> 00:07:56,921
Where?.

35
00:07:57,095 --> 00:07:59,222
Why, to the North Pole, of course.

36
00:07:59,397 --> 00:08:03,231
This is the Polar Express.

37
00:08:04,202 --> 00:08:05,897
The North Pole?.

38
00:08:07,405 --> 00:08:09,032
I see.

39
00:08:09,207 --> 00:08:10,606
Hold this, please.

40
00:08:10,775 --> 00:08:12,709
Thank you.

41
00:08:13,377 --> 00:08:15,345
Is this you?.

42
00:08:17,148 --> 00:08:18,979
-Yeah.
-Well, it says here...

43
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:23,814
...no photo with a department-store
Santa this year, no letter to Santa.

44
00:08:23,988 --> 00:08:27,651
And you made your sister
put out the milk and cookies.

45
00:08:28,226 --> 00:08:30,490
Sounds to me like
this is your crucial year.

46
00:08:30,661 --> 00:08:35,030
If I were you, I would think
about climbing onboard.

47
00:08:37,835 --> 00:08:42,295
Come on, come on.
I've got a schedule to keep.

48
00:08:45,009 --> 00:08:47,341
Suit yourself.

49
00:09:47,672 --> 00:09:51,335
'Cause that's the way things happen
On the Polar Express

50
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:54,535
Whoo, whoo, the whistle blows
That's the sound of her singing

51
00:09:54,712 --> 00:09:57,943
Ding, ding, the bell will ring
Golly, loo at her go

52
00:09:58,115 --> 00:10:01,551
You wonder if we'll get there soon
Anybody's guess

53
00:10:01,719 --> 00:10:04,950
'Cause that's the way things happen
On the Polar Express

54
00:10:05,122 --> 00:10:08,717
When we get there
We'll scream, ""Yay!""

55
00:10:08,893 --> 00:10:11,123
We'll arrive with
A bang, bang, bang

56
00:10:11,295 --> 00:10:13,559
Boom, boom, boom
Laughing all the way

57
00:10:13,731 --> 00:10:16,859
With a comfy seat and lots to eat
Boy, it's just the best

58
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:20,265
Wish it would 't ever have to end

59
00:10:20,438 --> 00:10:23,202
With a little luck, we'll be on time
There's no need to stress

60
00:10:23,374 --> 00:10:27,902
'Cause that's the way things happen
On the Polar Express

61
00:10:30,681 --> 00:10:34,378
Hey. Hey, you. Yeah, you.
Do you know what kind of train this is?

62
00:10:36,187 --> 00:10:39,054
Train. Do you know 
what kind of train this is? Do you?

63
00:10:41,359 --> 00:10:42,587
Of course.

64
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,921
It's a magic train.

65
00:10:45,263 --> 00:10:48,357
-We're going to the North Pole.
-I know it's a magic train.

66
00:10:48,532 --> 00:10:51,126
It's a Baldwin 2-8-4 S3-class
steam locomotive...

67
00:10:51,669 --> 00:10:56,197
built in 1921 at the 
Baldwin Locomotice Works. 
It weighs 456,100 pounds and....

68
00:10:56,374 --> 00:10:58,604
Are we really going to the North Pole?

69
00:10:59,176 --> 00:11:01,076
-Hey, look!
-Isn't that wonderful?

70
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,874
Herpolsheimer's! 
Herpolsheimer's!

71
00:11:09,587 --> 00:11:12,647
Wow, look at all those presents.
I want all of them.

72
00:11:12,823 --> 00:11:16,884
It's so Christmassy and cozy
and beautiful!

73
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,331
Tickets.

74
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:26,896
Tickets, please.

75
00:11:27,071 --> 00:11:28,663
Tickets.

76
00:11:31,842 --> 00:11:33,070
Ticket, please.

77
00:11:33,711 --> 00:11:35,611
Try your pocket.

78
00:11:42,053 --> 00:11:44,647
Try your other pocket.

79
00:12:01,739 --> 00:12:03,331
Thank you, sir.

80
00:12:13,464 --> 00:12:14,829
Hey, watch out, there.

81
00:12:14,999 --> 00:12:16,660
Thank you, sir.

82
00:12:17,935 --> 00:12:21,029
That is a public-address microphone.
It is not a toy.

83
00:12:21,205 --> 00:12:23,298
Boy, that guy sure likes to show off.

84
00:12:23,474 --> 00:12:26,272
Look what that wise guy
punched on my ticket.

85
00:12:26,611 --> 00:12:32,277
""L-E."" What the heck does that mean?.
-Next stop, 11244 Edbrooke.

86
00:12:33,484 --> 00:12:35,975
We're heading for the other side
of the tracks.

87
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:54,784
Well. You coming?

88
00:12:55,288 --> 00:12:56,721
It's just another pickup.

89
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:00,326
That's weird. I thought you were
supposed to be the last one.

90
00:13:00,493 --> 00:13:02,688
Why, to the North Pole, of course.

91
00:13:02,863 --> 00:13:05,696
This is the Polar Express.

92
00:13:08,935 --> 00:13:10,903
Suit yourself.

93
00:13:39,466 --> 00:13:42,993
Hey, that kid wants
to get on the train.

94
00:13:43,803 --> 00:13:45,896
Come on!

95
00:13:48,141 --> 00:13:49,904
Hurry up!

96
00:13:56,316 --> 00:13:57,749
We have to stop the train.

97
00:13:57,918 --> 00:14:00,409
-I don't know how.
-Pull the emergency brake!

98
00:14:30,417 --> 00:14:33,284
Who in the blazes applied
that emergency brake?.!

99
00:14:33,453 --> 00:14:34,886
He did.

100
00:14:35,055 --> 00:14:36,818
You.

101
00:14:37,324 --> 00:14:42,159
In case you didn't know, that cord
is for emergency purposes only.

102
00:14:42,662 --> 00:14:47,065
And in case you weren't aware,
tonight is Christmas Eve.

103
00:14:47,233 --> 00:14:51,294
And in case you hadn't noticed,
this train is on a very tight schedule.

104
00:14:51,471 --> 00:14:55,430
Now, young man, Christmas
may not be important to some people...

105
00:14:55,608 --> 00:14:59,066
...but it is very important
to the rest of us!

106
00:14:59,245 --> 00:15:00,735
But-- But--

107
00:15:00,914 --> 00:15:04,509
He was just trying to stop the train
so that kid could get on.

108
00:15:06,886 --> 00:15:10,151
I see. Young man,
is that what happened?.

109
00:15:14,661 --> 00:15:16,629
Well....

110
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:20,593
Let me remind you we are
on a very tight schedule.

111
00:15:20,767 --> 00:15:23,031
And I've never been late before...

112
00:15:23,203 --> 00:15:25,933
...and I am certainly not
going to be late tonight.

113
00:15:26,106 --> 00:15:30,099
Now, ecerybody, 
take your seats, please!

114
00:15:33,146 --> 00:15:35,171
Thank you.

115
00:15:39,052 --> 00:15:40,519
Your attention, please.

116
00:15:40,687 --> 00:15:45,181
Are there any Polar Express 
passengers in need of refreshment?.

117
00:15:45,358 --> 00:15:48,327
-Me! Me! Me!
-I thought so.

118
00:15:56,903 --> 00:15:58,393
-Hot, hot
-Oh, we got it

119
00:15:58,571 --> 00:16:00,505
-Hot, hot
-Hey, we got it

120
00:16:00,673 --> 00:16:03,437
-Hot, hot
-Say, we got it

121
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:04,907
Hot chocolate
Hot, hot

122
00:16:05,078 --> 00:16:06,807
-Oh, we got it
-Hot, hot

123
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,743
-So we got it
-Hot, hot

124
00:16:08,915 --> 00:16:11,179
Yo, we got it

125
00:16:11,351 --> 00:16:13,911
-Hot chocolate
-Here we 've only got one rule

126
00:16:14,087 --> 00:16:15,952
Never, ever let it cool

127
00:16:16,122 --> 00:16:17,783
Keep it cooking in the pot

128
00:16:17,957 --> 00:16:20,721
-Then you got
-Hot chocolate

129
00:16:25,598 --> 00:16:27,589
-Hot, hot
-Oh, we got it

130
00:16:27,767 --> 00:16:29,132
-Hot, hot
-Hey, we got it

131
00:16:29,302 --> 00:16:31,566
-Hot, hot
-Say, we got it

132
00:16:32,439 --> 00:16:33,667
Hot chocolate
Hot, hot

133
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,603
-Oh, we got it
-Hot, hot

134
00:16:35,775 --> 00:16:37,538
-So we got it
-Hot, hot

135
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,837
Yo, we got it

136
00:16:40,013 --> 00:16:42,573
-Hot chocolate
-Here we only got one rule

137
00:16:42,749 --> 00:16:44,444
Here we only got one rule

138
00:16:44,684 --> 00:16:46,413
Never, ever let it cool

139
00:16:46,586 --> 00:16:48,417
Never, ever let it cool

140
00:16:48,588 --> 00:16:50,351
Keep it cooking in the pot

141
00:16:50,523 --> 00:16:53,549
Soon you got hot chocolate

142
00:16:54,327 --> 00:16:56,022
-Hot, hot
-Hey, we got it

143
00:16:56,196 --> 00:16:57,959
-Hot, hot
-Oh, we got it

144
00:16:58,131 --> 00:16:59,894
-Hot, hot
- Yeah, we got it

145
00:17:00,066 --> 00:17:01,727
-Hot, hot
-Oh, we got it

146
00:17:02,068 --> 00:17:03,592
-Hot, hot
- Yeah, we got it

147
00:17:05,004 --> 00:17:06,403
-Oh, we got it
-Hot, hot

148
00:17:06,573 --> 00:17:08,803
Yeah, we got it

149
00:17:24,257 --> 00:17:27,226
You know, Montezuma,
the king of the Aztecs...

150
00:17:27,393 --> 00:17:30,988
...would drink 50 quarts
of hot chocolate every day.

151
00:17:31,164 --> 00:17:34,827
It was thick as mud and red.
He put chili pepper in instead of sugar.

152
00:17:35,001 --> 00:17:38,368
-Get it?. Hot chocolate?.
-How do you know?. That's not true.

153
00:17:38,538 --> 00:17:41,336
-Where you going with that?.
-It's for him.

154
00:17:41,508 --> 00:17:45,877
-I don't think we're to leave our seats.
-It's a violation of safety regulations...

155
00:17:46,045 --> 00:17:49,173
...for a kid to cross moving cars
without a grown-up.

156
00:17:49,482 --> 00:17:50,915
I think I'll be okay.

157
00:17:51,084 --> 00:17:53,518
Are you sure?.

158
00:18:02,328 --> 00:18:06,458
What about this lad in the back?.
Did he get any refreshment?.

159
00:18:08,434 --> 00:18:10,698
Well, let's take some to him,
by all means.

160
00:18:14,641 --> 00:18:17,235
Watch your step, now. 
Watch your step.

161
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,370
She forgot her ticket.

162
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:24,915
It hasn't been punched.

163
00:18:26,252 --> 00:18:28,914
What are you doing?.
You're gonna get us in trouble!

164
00:21:00,139 --> 00:21:03,040
Young lady, forgice me.

165
00:21:03,209 --> 00:21:06,736
I believe I have neglected
to punch your ticket.

166
00:21:06,913 --> 00:21:08,744
May l?.

167
00:21:10,717 --> 00:21:13,686
I left my ticket right here 
on the seat.

168
00:21:14,287 --> 00:21:16,221
-But it's gone.
-You mean...

169
00:21:16,689 --> 00:21:18,623
...you have lost your ticket.

170
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:20,725
She didn't lose her ticket.

171
00:21:21,828 --> 00:21:23,659
I did.

172
00:21:24,297 --> 00:21:27,357
I was trying to return it to you.

173
00:21:27,533 --> 00:21:30,400
But the wind blew it out of my hand.

174
00:21:34,006 --> 00:21:35,268
You can hace my ticket.

175
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:43,574
These tickets are not transferable.

176
00:21:44,317 --> 00:21:45,545
Young lady...

177
00:21:45,718 --> 00:21:48,812
...you will just have to
come along with me.

178
00:21:58,531 --> 00:22:02,297
You know what's gonna happen now?.
He's gonna throw her off the train.

179
00:22:02,468 --> 00:22:05,403
He's gonna probably throw her
off the rear platform.

180
00:22:05,571 --> 00:22:09,132
Standard procedure. That way,
she won't get sucked under the wheels.

181
00:22:09,308 --> 00:22:12,539
They may slow the train down,
but they're never gonna stop it.

182
00:22:12,712 --> 00:22:13,940
Stop it?.

183
00:22:14,113 --> 00:22:16,911
That's it! 
I hace to stop the train again.

184
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:19,347
No, please, don't do that again.

185
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:52,579
Where'd they go?.

186
00:22:53,019 --> 00:22:54,680
What happened to them?.

187
00:22:54,854 --> 00:22:57,823
Please, she's in big trouble.
You hace to help me.

188
00:23:35,428 --> 00:23:37,089
Hey!

189
00:23:40,199 --> 00:23:41,996
Hey!

190
00:23:42,168 --> 00:23:45,899
I found your ticket! Wait!

191
00:23:48,374 --> 00:23:49,841
Hey!

192
00:23:51,077 --> 00:23:52,374
Wait!

193
00:23:52,545 --> 00:23:54,945
I hace your ticket!

194
00:24:31,317 --> 00:24:33,217
Is there something 
I can do for you?.

195
00:24:33,386 --> 00:24:35,411
I'm looking for a girl.

196
00:24:36,122 --> 00:24:37,612
A gi--?.

197
00:24:43,029 --> 00:24:44,997
Ain't we all?.

198
00:24:45,898 --> 00:24:47,661
I hace her ticket.

199
00:24:47,833 --> 00:24:51,325
Well, lookie. Lookie here. 
What is this?

200
00:24:51,504 --> 00:24:56,100
This is an official, authentic,
genuine ticket to ride.

201
00:24:56,275 --> 00:24:59,767
You better keep this
in a safe place, young man.

202
00:24:59,946 --> 00:25:01,345
If I was you....

203
00:25:01,514 --> 00:25:04,176
I keep all my caluables right here.

204
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:06,511
Right here in the old size 12.

205
00:25:06,686 --> 00:25:08,916
Experience shows
this is the safest place.

206
00:25:10,323 --> 00:25:12,450
Not that I hace much use for those.

207
00:25:12,625 --> 00:25:13,853
Tickets.

208
00:25:14,026 --> 00:25:15,584
I ride for free.

209
00:25:15,761 --> 00:25:20,596
Oh, yeah, yeah. I hop aboard this 
rattler any time I feels like it.

210
00:25:20,766 --> 00:25:22,825
I own this train. Oh, yeah.

211
00:25:23,002 --> 00:25:27,462
It's like I'm the king of this train.
Yeah. The king of the Pol Ex.

212
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:33,704
In fact, I am the king
of the North Pole!

213
00:25:35,448 --> 00:25:37,746
Oh, where's my manners? 
Sit, sit. Sit.

214
00:25:37,917 --> 00:25:39,578
Take a load off.

215
00:25:39,752 --> 00:25:42,084
Hey, would you like some Joe?.

216
00:25:42,254 --> 00:25:47,783
Nice hot refreshment.
Perfect for a cold winter's night.

217
00:25:57,703 --> 00:25:59,694
There. Bless you.

218
00:26:01,507 --> 00:26:03,839
What about Santa?.

219
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:07,639
-Santa?.
-Isn't he the king of the North Pole?.

220
00:26:07,813 --> 00:26:11,044
You mean this guy?.

221
00:26:26,198 --> 00:26:30,828
What exactly is your persuasion
on the big man?.

222
00:26:31,003 --> 00:26:32,368
Since you brought him up.

223
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,665
Well, l....

224
00:26:36,842 --> 00:26:38,969
I want to beliece.

225
00:26:39,879 --> 00:26:42,905
-But--
-But you don't wanna be bamboozled.

226
00:26:43,082 --> 00:26:46,142
You don't wanna be
led down the primrose path.

227
00:26:46,318 --> 00:26:50,550
You don't wanna be conned or duped,
have the wool pulled ocer your eyes.

228
00:26:50,723 --> 00:26:54,819
Hoodwinked. You don't wanna be
taken for a ride, railroaded.

229
00:26:58,664 --> 00:27:01,724
Seeing is believing.

230
00:27:02,201 --> 00:27:03,668
Am I right?.

231
00:27:04,704 --> 00:27:07,172
But what about this train?.

232
00:27:08,808 --> 00:27:10,207
What about it?.

233
00:27:10,409 --> 00:27:13,344
We're all really going
to the North Pole...

234
00:27:13,512 --> 00:27:14,740
...aren't we?.

235
00:27:15,014 --> 00:27:17,312
Aren't we?.

236
00:27:18,284 --> 00:27:22,687
Are you saying
that this is all just a dream?.

237
00:27:22,922 --> 00:27:26,483
You said it, kid. Not me.

238
00:27:30,563 --> 00:27:33,999
So let's go find that girl.

239
00:27:40,239 --> 00:27:42,366
One other thing.

240
00:27:43,642 --> 00:27:45,803
Do you believe in ghosts?.

241
00:27:49,515 --> 00:27:51,380
Interesting.

242
00:27:54,053 --> 00:27:55,543
Wait.

243
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:59,218
Wait!

244
00:28:06,132 --> 00:28:07,724
Wait!

245
00:28:12,705 --> 00:28:14,263
I hace to wake up.

246
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,499
Yeah. I hace to wake up.

247
00:28:16,842 --> 00:28:20,073
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.

248
00:28:20,346 --> 00:28:22,507
Wake up!

249
00:28:38,097 --> 00:28:41,555
Kid!

250
00:28:41,734 --> 00:28:43,929
Kid, get your head out of the clouds!

251
00:28:44,103 --> 00:28:45,661
Wake up, kid!

252
00:28:45,838 --> 00:28:49,604
There's no sleepwalking
on the Polar Express.

253
00:28:50,576 --> 00:28:52,441
We gotta jump them knuckles.

254
00:28:55,181 --> 00:28:57,115
Come on, kid. Flip my shoulders.

255
00:28:57,283 --> 00:28:59,114
Grab my lily.

256
00:29:01,754 --> 00:29:04,245
That skirt you're chasing
must have moved ahead.

257
00:29:04,924 --> 00:29:08,826
-We gotta hightail it 
  to the hog, pronto.
-To the hog?.

258
00:29:09,695 --> 00:29:12,994
The engine. The engine, 
you tenderfoot.

259
00:29:13,165 --> 00:29:16,396
We gotta make the engine
before we hit Flat Top Tunnel.

260
00:29:16,569 --> 00:29:18,230
How come?.

261
00:29:18,404 --> 00:29:21,032
So many questions.

262
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,774
There is but one inch of clearance
between the roof of this rattler...

263
00:29:25,945 --> 00:29:28,812
...and the roof of Flat Top Tunnel.

264
00:29:28,981 --> 00:29:30,846
Savvy?.

265
00:29:33,986 --> 00:29:37,012
It's just the run up to the hump, kid.

266
00:29:37,857 --> 00:29:39,518
This will be interesting.

267
00:30:02,715 --> 00:30:04,444
Get back on, kid. Hurry!

268
00:30:04,617 --> 00:30:06,881
Grab my muck stick.

269
00:30:42,621 --> 00:30:45,089
There's only one trick to this, kid.

270
00:30:46,258 --> 00:30:47,782
When I say ""jump""...

271
00:30:50,195 --> 00:30:54,131
...you jump!

272
00:31:16,922 --> 00:31:20,085
You. I thought 
you got thrown off, and--

273
00:31:20,492 --> 00:31:23,325
-You're driving the train?.
-They put me in charge.

274
00:31:23,495 --> 00:31:26,896
-The engineer had to check the light.
-Here's the light. Careful.

275
00:31:27,066 --> 00:31:28,727
All right, now.

276
00:31:30,869 --> 00:31:32,359
I got it.

277
00:31:35,074 --> 00:31:38,566
-How do you know how?.
-It's easy. Come here, 
  I'll show you.

278
00:31:38,744 --> 00:31:41,212
This big lecer here, 
that's the throttle.

279
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,473
This little one here, 
that's the brake.

280
00:31:43,649 --> 00:31:46,550
And those are the pressure gauges.

281
00:31:46,719 --> 00:31:49,279
And that rope is the whistle.

282
00:31:49,955 --> 00:31:51,684
The whistle.

283
00:31:52,458 --> 00:31:54,392
You wanna try it?.

284
00:31:57,229 --> 00:32:00,221
I've wanted to do that my whole life.

285
00:32:03,769 --> 00:32:06,932
Hold still! Hold still! 
Don't move!

286
00:32:08,107 --> 00:32:09,131
Look!

287
00:32:21,387 --> 00:32:24,823
Stop the train! 
Stop the train!

288
00:32:25,858 --> 00:32:27,689
Stop the train!

289
00:32:30,662 --> 00:32:32,391
What?.

290
00:32:32,564 --> 00:32:35,192
They want us to stop the train.

291
00:32:35,367 --> 00:32:37,835
-Which one is the brake?.
-He told me this was.

292
00:32:38,003 --> 00:32:39,732
-Who?.
-The engineer.

293
00:32:39,938 --> 00:32:44,500
-The engineer?. This one 
  looks like a brake.
-No, he said this was the brake.

294
00:32:44,676 --> 00:32:45,734
Are you sure?.

295
00:32:47,246 --> 00:32:48,508
Are you sure?.

296
00:32:55,621 --> 00:32:58,317
Pull the brake!

297
00:32:58,524 --> 00:33:00,389
Stop the train!

298
00:33:17,776 --> 00:33:19,710
Caribou?.

299
00:33:22,281 --> 00:33:26,149
There can be no Christmas without
the Polar Express arriving on time.

300
00:33:26,318 --> 00:33:29,617
Am I the only one 
who understands that?.

301
00:33:29,788 --> 00:33:32,552
You. I should have known.

302
00:33:32,724 --> 00:33:36,592
Are you bound and determined 
that this train never reaches 
the North Pole?.

303
00:33:36,762 --> 00:33:38,354
But look.

304
00:33:39,598 --> 00:33:41,259
Caribou crossing?

305
00:33:42,101 --> 00:33:45,867
I make that herd to be at least
100,000, maybe even a million.

306
00:33:46,038 --> 00:33:49,098
It's gonna be hours
before they clear this track.

307
00:33:49,274 --> 00:33:53,335
-A tough nut to crack.
-We are in some serious jelly.

308
00:33:53,512 --> 00:33:55,946
-And a jam.
-Tight spot.

309
00:33:56,115 --> 00:33:57,480
-Up a creek.
-Up a tree.

310
00:33:57,649 --> 00:34:00,846
-Lost in the grass.
-I'll tell you what's grass: our a--

311
00:34:43,262 --> 00:34:47,665
Problem solced. All ahead, slow.

312
00:35:33,558 --> 00:35:35,458
We're going pretty fast.

313
00:35:35,627 --> 00:35:38,528
Tell the engineer to slow down.

314
00:35:43,869 --> 00:35:45,496
Slow it down.

315
00:35:47,372 --> 00:35:50,102
Watch the speed!

316
00:35:55,146 --> 00:35:58,206
Jumping jeepers,
the cotter pin sheared off.

317
00:35:58,383 --> 00:35:59,645
-What?.
-The pin.

318
00:35:59,818 --> 00:36:01,979
-Where?.
-There.

319
00:36:02,153 --> 00:36:03,711
-Oh, no.
-Oh, no.

320
00:36:04,756 --> 00:36:07,657
-They can't hear me.
-They can't?.

321
00:36:11,196 --> 00:36:13,596
I don't like the look of this.
Under the safety bar.

322
00:36:15,667 --> 00:36:17,601
Is everything all right?.
What should we do?.

323
00:36:19,754 --> 00:36:22,348
Considering we've lost communication
with the engineer...

324
00:36:22,523 --> 00:36:25,686
we are standing totally exposed
on the front of the locomotive...

325
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:29,023
...the train appears to be
accelerating uncontrollably...

326
00:36:29,197 --> 00:36:33,031
...and we are rapidly
approaching Glacier Gulch...

327
00:36:33,201 --> 00:36:36,693
which happens to be the steepest
downhill grade in the world...

328
00:36:36,871 --> 00:36:40,170
...I suggest we all hold on...

329
00:36:40,708 --> 00:36:42,938
...tightly.

330
00:37:03,131 --> 00:37:04,996
-The pin.
-The pin.

331
00:37:24,652 --> 00:37:28,383
Jiminy Christmas, the ice 
has frozen over the tracks.

332
00:37:50,778 --> 00:37:52,939
Hold on. Hold on. No, no.

333
00:37:53,881 --> 00:37:55,974
Come on. Watch your step.

334
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:59,347
Come on, sweetie.
Up you go. Up you go.

335
00:38:01,823 --> 00:38:04,291
Put your feet on here. On here.

336
00:38:06,828 --> 00:38:08,125
Little adcenture, huh?.

337
00:38:08,296 --> 00:38:10,696
Young man, 
quick thinking on your part.

338
00:38:31,819 --> 00:38:34,549
Step to your left, please. 
To your left.

339
00:38:38,392 --> 00:38:41,884
Well, that is more like it.

340
00:38:44,298 --> 00:38:46,994
What in the name of Mike?.

341
00:38:50,137 --> 00:38:51,570
Look.

342
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:56,972
Get us the blazes out of here!

343
00:39:05,219 --> 00:39:06,811
Turn this sled around.

344
00:39:25,306 --> 00:39:26,705
Look there.

345
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:30,741
Tracks.

346
00:39:30,912 --> 00:39:32,345
Dead ahead.

347
00:39:38,185 --> 00:39:39,277
Right.

348
00:39:45,159 --> 00:39:46,148
Left.

349
00:39:51,632 --> 00:39:52,656
Right.

350
00:39:56,537 --> 00:39:57,765
Hang a Louie.

351
00:40:00,908 --> 00:40:02,273
Toss a Ritchie.

352
00:40:05,646 --> 00:40:07,307
Port astern.

353
00:40:09,517 --> 00:40:11,348
To the starboard.

354
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:15,214
-My slipper.
-You're gonna lose your ticket.

355
00:40:15,389 --> 00:40:17,254
It's not my ticket, it's yours.

356
00:40:17,425 --> 00:40:19,256
-It's my ticket?.
-Yes.

357
00:40:19,427 --> 00:40:21,554
Right. Keep up with me. Left.

358
00:40:21,896 --> 00:40:24,296
Right. Left.

359
00:40:28,369 --> 00:40:29,700
Right.

360
00:40:30,037 --> 00:40:31,299
Left.

361
00:40:31,472 --> 00:40:32,871
Right.

362
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,974
Left. Right.

363
00:40:38,713 --> 00:40:39,975
-Oh, no!
-Oh, no!

364
00:40:42,216 --> 00:40:44,013
Brace yourselces!

365
00:40:55,011 --> 00:40:56,911
Well, that's more like it.

366
00:40:59,316 --> 00:41:00,840
Thank you.

367
00:41:01,017 --> 00:41:04,282
Thank you. I can't believe
you found my ticket.

368
00:41:04,855 --> 00:41:07,483
Did someone say 
they found a ticket?.

369
00:41:09,459 --> 00:41:12,895
Well, in that case.... 
Tickets, please.

370
00:41:21,771 --> 00:41:23,295
Thank you.

371
00:41:25,041 --> 00:41:28,943
-""L-E""?.
-Just like that know-it-all kid.

372
00:41:43,976 --> 00:41:46,536
Watch your step.
Tricky walking up here.

373
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:49,078
It's mighty slick.
Mighty slick, I tell you.

374
00:41:50,249 --> 00:41:52,809
There you go. 
What did I tell you?.

375
00:41:52,985 --> 00:41:58,082
Years ago, on my first 
Christmas Ece run,I was up on 
the roof making my rounds...

376
00:41:58,257 --> 00:42:00,191
when I slipped on the ice myself.

377
00:42:00,359 --> 00:42:03,795
I reached out for a hand iron,
but it broke off. I slid and fell.

378
00:42:03,962 --> 00:42:07,955
And yet, I did not 
fall off this train.

379
00:42:08,534 --> 00:42:10,798
Someone saved you?.

380
00:42:10,969 --> 00:42:12,960
Or something.

381
00:42:15,841 --> 00:42:17,138
An angel.

382
00:42:18,043 --> 00:42:19,704
Maybe.

383
00:42:19,878 --> 00:42:21,937
Wait. Wait.

384
00:42:22,781 --> 00:42:25,944
What did he look like? 
Did you see him?.

385
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:30,988
No, sir. But sometimes
seeing is believing.

386
00:42:31,356 --> 00:42:36,453
And sometimes the most 
real things in the world 
are the things we can't see.

387
00:42:42,334 --> 00:42:44,632
The forsaken and the abandoned.

388
00:42:45,804 --> 00:42:49,831
Mind your step, now.
These poor toys have 
suffered enough...

389
00:42:50,008 --> 00:42:54,342
being left to rust and decay 
in the back alleys and cacant 
lots of the world.

390
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:58,977
-What are they doing here?.
-It's a new concept 
 the boss came up with.

391
00:42:59,151 --> 00:43:02,552
Instead of being thrown away,
they're collected. Refurbished.

392
00:43:03,255 --> 00:43:08,352
He calls it ""rebicycling.""
Something like that.

393
00:43:10,596 --> 00:43:12,996
Makes me wanna cry...

394
00:43:13,165 --> 00:43:16,362
...seeing toys that were
treated this way.

395
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:21,368
These hopelessly entangled
string puppets and marionettes...

396
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:25,806
pose a particular problem. We found
the nimble fingers of our work force

397
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:30,312
here at the North Pole 
are best for working out 
those knots and tangles.

398
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:33,007
Thank you. Double-locked here.

399
00:43:44,429 --> 00:43:47,865
You are just like me, my friend.

400
00:43:48,033 --> 00:43:50,433
A scrooge!

401
00:43:50,602 --> 00:43:52,763
Ebenezer Scrooge.

402
00:43:52,938 --> 00:43:56,271
North Pole, Santa Claus, this train...

403
00:43:56,441 --> 00:44:00,343
...it's all a bunch of humbug.
A bout of indigestion.

404
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:03,106
Oh, yeah. I know what you are.

405
00:44:03,282 --> 00:44:05,910
You're a doubter.

406
00:44:06,084 --> 00:44:08,609
A doubter. You don't believe!

407
00:44:08,787 --> 00:44:11,950
You're a doubter! 
You don't beliece!

408
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:31,976
You missed it.We rode down 
some really sharp hills.

409
00:44:32,144 --> 00:44:36,513
We were on what looked like a 
frozen lake. But I know it was 
just an optical illusion.

410
00:44:36,682 --> 00:44:39,583
He said the train was on ice.
I said it's impossible--

411
00:44:39,751 --> 00:44:42,481
You can't put a train track--
Where you going now?.

412
00:44:57,002 --> 00:44:59,971
I'm wishing on a star

413
00:45:00,138 --> 00:45:03,301
And trying to believe

414
00:45:03,475 --> 00:45:06,603
That even though it's far

415
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:09,604
He'll find me Christmas Eve

416
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:13,377
I guess that Santa 's busy

417
00:45:13,552 --> 00:45:16,544
'Cause he's never come around

418
00:45:17,055 --> 00:45:22,789
I think of him
When Christmas comes to town

419
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:26,758
The best time of the year

420
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:30,129
When everyone comes home

421
00:45:30,302 --> 00:45:33,499
With all this Christmas cheer

422
00:45:33,672 --> 00:45:37,199
It's hard to be alone

423
00:45:37,376 --> 00:45:43,406
Putting up the Christmas tree
With friends who come around

424
00:45:43,582 --> 00:45:49,953
It's so much fun
When Christmas comes to town

425
00:45:50,756 --> 00:45:56,820
Presents for the children
Wrapped in red and green

426
00:45:57,396 --> 00:46:03,164
All the things I've heard about
But never really seen

427
00:46:04,036 --> 00:46:06,527
No one will be sleeping

428
00:46:06,705 --> 00:46:09,765
On the night of Christmas Eve

429
00:46:09,941 --> 00:46:17,006
Hoping Santa 's on his way

430
00:46:17,182 --> 00:46:20,276
When Santa 's sleighbells ring

431
00:46:20,452 --> 00:46:23,319
I listen all around

432
00:46:23,488 --> 00:46:26,685
The herald angels sing

433
00:46:26,858 --> 00:46:29,884
I never hear a sound

434
00:46:30,429 --> 00:46:33,887
And all the dreams of children

435
00:46:34,066 --> 00:46:36,830
Once lost will all be found

436
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:42,941
That's all I want
When Christmas comes to town

437
00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:53,979
That's all I want
When Christmas comes to town

438
00:47:05,497 --> 00:47:06,964
Look.

439
00:47:09,634 --> 00:47:11,625
The northern lights.

440
00:47:14,473 --> 00:47:16,498
Hey. You three.

441
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:19,506
We just crossed it.

442
00:47:19,678 --> 00:47:25,082
Latitude 6622'.
The Arctic Circle.

443
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:28,583
And do you see?.
Those lights in the distance.

444
00:47:29,521 --> 00:47:33,981
They look like the lights 
of a strange ocean liner 
sailing on a frozen sea.

445
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:37,285
There...

446
00:47:37,963 --> 00:47:39,988
...is the North Pole.

447
00:47:45,003 --> 00:47:47,836
It's a magic carpet on a rail
It never takes a rest

448
00:47:48,006 --> 00:47:51,169
flying through
The mountains and the snow

449
00:47:51,343 --> 00:47:54,278
You can ride for free and 
join the fun If you just say yes

450
00:47:54,446 --> 00:47:57,813
'Cause that's the way things 
happen On the Polar Express

451
00:47:57,983 --> 00:48:01,077
Whoo, whoo, the whistle blows
That's the sound of her singing

452
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:04,450
Ding, ding, the bell will ring
Golly, look at her go

453
00:48:04,623 --> 00:48:07,649
You wonder if you'll get there soon
Anybody's guess

454
00:48:07,826 --> 00:48:11,023
'Cause that's the way things happen
On the Polar Express

455
00:48:11,196 --> 00:48:14,290
When we get there
We'll scream, ""Yay!""

456
00:48:14,466 --> 00:48:16,798
We'll arrive with
A bang, bang, bang

457
00:48:16,968 --> 00:48:19,960
Boom, boom, boom
Laughing all the way

458
00:48:24,976 --> 00:48:27,911
We made it. 
With five minutes to spare.

459
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:29,944
We made it.

460
00:48:55,407 --> 00:48:57,671
There should be elces.
Where are the elces?.

461
00:48:57,843 --> 00:48:59,504
Yeah, where are the elces?.

462
00:48:59,678 --> 00:49:02,044
They are gathering
in the center of the city.

463
00:49:02,214 --> 00:49:05,980
That is where Santa will give
the first gift of Christmas.

464
00:49:06,852 --> 00:49:09,320
Who gets the first gift of Christmas?.

465
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:13,390
He will choose one of you.

466
00:49:16,361 --> 00:49:19,353
-Look.
-Elces!

467
00:49:50,262 --> 00:49:52,560
All right. All right,
ladies and gentlemen.

468
00:49:52,731 --> 00:49:55,461
Two columns, if you please.

469
00:49:55,634 --> 00:49:58,432
Shorter in the front, 
taller in the rear.

470
00:49:58,937 --> 00:50:02,532
Even-numbered birthdays on the right,
odd-numbered on the left.

471
00:50:02,707 --> 00:50:05,642
No pushing. No pushing.
But let's not dilly-dally.

472
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:07,710
It's fice minutes to midnight.

473
00:50:07,879 --> 00:50:11,474
Hey, what gives?. It was five minutes
till midnight four minutes ago.

474
00:50:11,917 --> 00:50:14,442
Exactly. Columns of two.

475
00:50:14,619 --> 00:50:16,712
-One, two.
-Excuse me.

476
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:19,356
-Question.
-What about him?.

477
00:50:22,127 --> 00:50:24,823
No one is required to see Santa.

478
00:50:25,964 --> 00:50:29,161
Ladies and gentlemen,
you do not hace to hold hands...

479
00:50:29,334 --> 00:50:32,792
- Come on.
-...but please remain in your columns...

480
00:50:32,971 --> 00:50:35,337
...while we are in transit.

481
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:48,442
-Look, you have to come with us.
-She's right.

482
00:50:50,388 --> 00:50:54,848
Christmas just doesn't work out
for me. Never has.

483
00:50:55,026 --> 00:50:57,654
But Christmas is such a wonderful,
beautiful time.

484
00:50:57,829 --> 00:51:01,424
It's a time for giving and being 
thankful, for friends and family.

485
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:06,401
People hang decorations and lights. 
Santa leaces presents 
under our Christmas trees.

486
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:10,069
Christmas just...

487
00:51:10,642 --> 00:51:12,542
...doesn't work out for me.

488
00:51:14,312 --> 00:51:18,043
Look, I don't know if Christmas
is gonna work out for you or not...

489
00:51:18,216 --> 00:51:21,310
...but this is Christmas Eve.
Don't stay here by yourself.

490
00:51:22,988 --> 00:51:24,546
Yes, come with us.

491
00:51:25,090 --> 00:51:26,887
We'll go together.

492
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:40,597
Oh, no.

493
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:50,547
We're gonna be okay.

494
00:51:52,851 --> 00:51:54,978
Maybe not!

495
00:51:56,888 --> 00:51:58,822
The emergency brake.

496
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:00,958
The emergency brake.

497
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:08,463
There's no brake. 
I can't find the brake!

498
00:52:14,973 --> 00:52:17,533
Take a brake, kid.

499
00:52:17,709 --> 00:52:21,372
How about a nice, 
good hot cup of Joe?.

500
00:52:50,008 --> 00:52:51,100
We're gonna crash!

501
00:52:58,083 --> 00:53:00,017
We're spinning.

502
00:53:26,156 --> 00:53:28,090
You hear that?.

503
00:53:28,692 --> 00:53:29,954
The bell.

504
00:53:31,361 --> 00:53:33,727
-What bell?.
-The sleighbell.

505
00:53:33,897 --> 00:53:36,297
-Sleighbell?.
-Don't you hear it?.

506
00:53:37,634 --> 00:53:40,194
It's coming from that tunnel.

507
00:53:45,742 --> 00:53:47,869
That's the way we should go.

508
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:57,878
Come on.

509
00:54:30,087 --> 00:54:31,645
What?.

510
00:54:32,156 --> 00:54:34,818
-What?.
-Come on.

511
00:54:46,837 --> 00:54:47,826
Come on.

512
00:54:57,648 --> 00:54:59,445
We're lost.

513
00:55:09,426 --> 00:55:10,825
Yes.

514
00:55:12,062 --> 00:55:14,997
-Yes. I hear it.
-I hear it too.

515
00:55:15,165 --> 00:55:19,226
-I don't hear anything.
-Okay, it's down this way.

516
00:55:19,403 --> 00:55:20,631
Are you sure?.

517
00:55:25,205 --> 00:55:26,536
Absolutely.

518
00:55:32,196 --> 00:55:34,664
Why can't I hear anything?.

519
00:55:37,268 --> 00:55:39,896
Get down and be quiet.

520
00:55:49,046 --> 00:55:50,377
Yeah.

521
00:55:53,384 --> 00:55:54,908
Okay.

522
00:55:55,819 --> 00:55:57,946
Well, that was the 
wrapping hall, chief.

523
00:55:58,122 --> 00:56:00,682
-Just finished the last one.
-How's it wrapped?.

524
00:56:00,858 --> 00:56:04,794
It's wrapped in candy-striped red
with a number-seven holly-green bow.

525
00:56:04,962 --> 00:56:08,261
A number-seven bow?.
When we're this close to liftoff?.

526
00:56:08,432 --> 00:56:11,890
What are they thinking down there?.
Are they meshuggener?.

527
00:56:12,069 --> 00:56:14,299
-What's the routing?.
-Going to the States.

528
00:56:14,471 --> 00:56:16,666
Grand Rapids, Michigan.

529
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:20,199
That's my town. 
I'm from Grand Rapids.

530
00:56:25,516 --> 00:56:28,576
We got a troublemaker now.
Just what we need.

531
00:56:28,752 --> 00:56:31,653
Things aren't bad enough.
What's his 20?.

532
00:56:31,822 --> 00:56:35,121
Apparently, some kid
from Maplewood, New Jersey...

533
00:56:35,292 --> 00:56:37,692
stuck some gum in his sister's hair.

534
00:56:38,595 --> 00:56:41,621
New Jersey?. Is that the same kid
that put the tack...

535
00:56:41,965 --> 00:56:46,800
-underneath his teacher's chair last year?.
-No, sir. This kid's name is Steven.

536
00:56:47,971 --> 00:56:50,906
So, what do we do, chief?.
Alert the big man?.

537
00:56:51,075 --> 00:56:54,067
We talking nothing for Christmas here?.

538
00:57:01,034 --> 00:57:02,399
I didn 't do it.

539
00:57:03,069 --> 00:57:04,798
I didn 't do it.

540
00:57:04,971 --> 00:57:06,734
I didn 't do it.

541
00:57:09,075 --> 00:57:11,543
Look, it's....
It's almost Christmas, huh?.

542
00:57:12,145 --> 00:57:13,874
We'll cut the kid a break.

543
00:57:14,047 --> 00:57:16,311
But put him on the check-twice list
for next year.

544
00:57:17,050 --> 00:57:19,143
All right, boys.

545
00:57:19,386 --> 00:57:22,446
Let's shut it down.
That's it for this year. Come on.

546
00:57:22,622 --> 00:57:27,150
-Hey, boss, are we taking the pneumatic?.
-Of course we're taking the pneumatic.

547
00:57:27,327 --> 00:57:30,490
It's the only way to get
to the square on time.

548
00:57:30,663 --> 00:57:33,928
-Let's go.
-And time is money.

549
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:37,298
Ready, and mount.

550
00:57:38,738 --> 00:57:41,366
Good. Close.

551
00:57:55,955 --> 00:57:57,786
All right, get in.

552
00:57:59,259 --> 00:58:01,352
I don't know about this.

553
00:58:36,262 --> 00:58:39,129
I don't hear it. Do you?.

554
00:58:40,467 --> 00:58:42,059
No.

555
00:58:43,703 --> 00:58:46,194
I think we should follow those arrows.

556
00:59:00,453 --> 00:59:02,921
I thought there'd be a way out.

557
00:59:03,089 --> 00:59:05,319
We're gonna miss ecerything.

558
00:59:15,335 --> 00:59:16,927
Hey, look.

559
00:59:18,404 --> 00:59:19,928
A present.

560
00:59:24,277 --> 00:59:27,269
It's going to my town.
To someone named Billy.

561
00:59:27,447 --> 00:59:33,044
-My name is Billy.
-It's going to 1 1 344 Edbrooke Avenue.

562
00:59:33,219 --> 00:59:35,084
That's my address.

563
00:59:42,896 --> 00:59:44,454
Come on.

564
01:00:44,472 --> 01:00:45,803
Look.

565
01:00:47,375 --> 01:00:50,833
It says, ""Merry Christmas, Billy.
From Mr. C.""

566
01:00:51,846 --> 01:00:56,215
I think I know what it is.
I wanted one of these my whole life.

567
01:00:57,185 --> 01:00:59,483
Wait, wait. Stop. Look.

568
01:01:01,590 --> 01:01:03,717
But l....

569
01:01:03,892 --> 01:01:05,723
Those are the rules.

570
01:03:06,613 --> 01:03:08,274
Something's got me.

571
01:03:08,448 --> 01:03:10,177
It's got my leg.

572
01:03:10,717 --> 01:03:12,082
I can't hold him.

573
01:03:12,619 --> 01:03:15,554
Give me your other hand.
Give me your other hand.

574
01:03:15,922 --> 01:03:18,254
-I can't.
-On three.

575
01:03:18,425 --> 01:03:21,553
One, two, three.

576
01:03:22,328 --> 01:03:24,319
-Look.
-It's still got me.

577
01:03:24,497 --> 01:03:27,796
On three again. One, two, three.

578
01:03:31,171 --> 01:03:32,638
-You.
-You.

579
01:03:32,806 --> 01:03:34,865
-What are you doing here?.
-Same as you.

580
01:03:35,041 --> 01:03:38,602
Checking my presents. Making sure
I'm getting everything on my list.

581
01:03:38,778 --> 01:03:41,713
I found one present.
All it had was stupid underwear.

582
01:03:41,881 --> 01:03:43,508
Look.

583
01:03:52,058 --> 01:03:54,253
You may start your descent
any time now.

584
01:03:54,427 --> 01:03:56,691
At your convenience, of course.

585
01:04:08,842 --> 01:04:12,278
It's still fice to.
I think we're gonna make it.

586
01:04:12,445 --> 01:04:15,073
Of course. It's been five to
for the last hour.

587
01:04:15,248 --> 01:04:18,809
We got plenty of time. We got nothing
but time. We got time to kill.

588
01:04:18,985 --> 01:04:22,751
You know what?.
I don't think we're gonna make it.

589
01:04:25,158 --> 01:04:28,286
I may be just an old railroader...

590
01:04:28,461 --> 01:04:31,259
...and know nothing about
lighter-than-air craft...

591
01:04:31,431 --> 01:04:36,926
...but from my layman's perspective,
you need more altitude!

592
01:04:37,103 --> 01:04:39,537
More altitude!

593
01:04:40,273 --> 01:04:43,242
Altitude, please. 
A bit more altitude, please.

594
01:04:44,210 --> 01:04:46,371
Geronimo!

595
01:05:01,761 --> 01:05:03,285
The Flying Elves.

596
01:05:03,463 --> 01:05:06,227
They are specialists.
Do not try that at home, kids.

597
01:05:06,399 --> 01:05:08,367
Do not try that at home.

598
01:05:08,535 --> 01:05:09,797
We're not gonna make it.

599
01:05:50,043 --> 01:05:51,670
A well-oiled machine.

600
01:06:01,454 --> 01:06:04,287
All right, you stowaways.

601
01:06:04,724 --> 01:06:07,887
-Party's over.
-I was just following them.

602
01:06:08,061 --> 01:06:09,995
We fell in here by mistake.

603
01:06:10,163 --> 01:06:13,860
Forget about it. We knew you
was in there the whole time.

604
01:06:15,768 --> 01:06:17,133
Come on, out you go.

605
01:06:17,303 --> 01:06:21,034
Let's go, come on.
Step up, step up. There we go.

606
01:06:21,207 --> 01:06:24,438
Not a problem. Come on.
Watch your step. There you go.

607
01:06:30,316 --> 01:06:33,649
So nobody gets hurt, here's
how we're gonna get you guys down.

608
01:06:33,820 --> 01:06:37,187
-This is simple. Why, I know--
-What do you know?.

609
01:06:37,490 --> 01:06:41,017
You're not supposed to be here
in the first place.

610
01:06:41,394 --> 01:06:45,660
But since it's Christmas,
I'm gonna let you slide.

611
01:06:45,832 --> 01:06:46,821
Hey.

612
01:06:49,402 --> 01:06:50,733
Been looking for you.

613
01:06:53,873 --> 01:06:55,238
There you go.

614
01:06:55,408 --> 01:06:56,636
Watch your step.

615
01:06:56,809 --> 01:06:58,743
Careful.

616
01:06:58,911 --> 01:07:00,970
Beautiful form. Beautiful.

617
01:07:01,147 --> 01:07:03,547
Nice to see you again.

618
01:07:05,418 --> 01:07:08,148
Cutting it kind of close, 
aren't we?.

619
01:07:08,321 --> 01:07:11,916
I'll take care of this.

620
01:07:12,091 --> 01:07:14,218
It's in good hands.

621
01:07:14,394 --> 01:07:17,022
Trust me.

622
01:07:45,458 --> 01:07:49,087
It's the spirit of the season

623
01:07:49,262 --> 01:07:52,789
You can feel it in the air

624
01:07:52,965 --> 01:07:56,696
You can hear it if you listen

625
01:07:56,869 --> 01:08:00,532
Everywhere So much care

626
01:08:00,707 --> 01:08:02,402
Like a prayer

627
01:08:02,575 --> 01:08:06,238
Whatever it is
You need to share it

628
01:08:06,412 --> 01:08:11,577
It's the spirit of the season

629
01:08:21,094 --> 01:08:26,088
It's the spirit of the season

630
01:08:30,603 --> 01:08:35,006
You can feel it in the air

631
01:08:48,388 --> 01:08:51,516
Aren't those bells
the most beautiful sound?.

632
01:10:07,733 --> 01:10:09,257
He's here! He's here!

633
01:10:09,435 --> 01:10:10,663
Where?.

634
01:10:10,837 --> 01:10:13,203
I see him. He's ocer there.

635
01:10:13,372 --> 01:10:14,862
I can't see him.

636
01:10:35,061 --> 01:10:37,086
I can't see him.

637
01:10:37,263 --> 01:10:40,027
I can't see him!

638
01:11:42,628 --> 01:11:46,120
Doubter. Doubter.

639
01:11:49,735 --> 01:11:51,202
Okay.

640
01:11:52,271 --> 01:11:54,205
Okay.

646
01:12:49,762 --> 01:12:53,994

647
01:12:55,635 --> 01:12:57,227
Well....

648
01:12:59,071 --> 01:13:00,299
Thank you.

649
01:13:00,473 --> 01:13:03,738
-Me, me. Pick me, Santa.
-What are you doing?. Stop it.

650
01:13:03,909 --> 01:13:06,969
-Pick me, pick me. 
 I want the first gift.
-Hush.

651
01:13:07,146 --> 01:13:09,114
Young man...

652
01:13:09,281 --> 01:13:11,112
...patience.

653
01:13:11,283 --> 01:13:15,947
And a smidgen of humility
might also serve you well.

654
01:13:16,122 --> 01:13:17,749
Yes, sir.

655
01:13:19,091 --> 01:13:21,355
And you, young lady....

656
01:13:21,527 --> 01:13:23,256
A lady of decision.

657
01:13:23,429 --> 01:13:27,331
Full of confidence and spirit.

658
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:29,692
Christmas spirit.

659
01:13:32,538 --> 01:13:34,096
Keep up the good work.

660
01:13:35,508 --> 01:13:37,135
Thank you.

661
01:13:38,077 --> 01:13:39,704
And Billy.

662
01:13:41,213 --> 01:13:42,942
It is Billy?.

665
01:13:52,024 --> 01:13:53,992
That's a lucky lad.

666
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:56,628
There's no greater gift than friendship.

667
01:13:59,598 --> 01:14:02,533
And speaking of gifts...

668
01:14:06,939 --> 01:14:09,430
...Iet's have this young fellow

669
01:14:46,946 --> 01:14:48,538
Now...

01:14:48,714 --> 01:14:51,706

671
01:14:51,884 --> 01:14:53,749

Yes, indeed.

675
01:15:24,817 --> 01:15:28,617
The first gift of Christmas!

676
01:15:43,169 --> 01:15:46,935
This bell is a wonderful symbol
of the spirit of Christmas...

01:15:47,106 --> 01:15:49,631

...Iies in your heart.

681
01:16:09,929 --> 01:16:11,760
Merry Christmas.

682
01:16:13,799 --> 01:16:16,632
Better keep that in a safe place.

683
01:16:36,522 --> 01:16:41,391
Hey, hey. Man alive, are you lucky.

684
01:17:03,649 --> 01:17:06,243
Pull, Comet. Pull, boy!

685
01:17:09,421 --> 01:17:11,616
Prancer, that's a girl.

686
01:17:16,262 --> 01:17:18,526
Good boy, Donder.

687
01:17:50,362 --> 01:17:54,628
Now, Dasher. Now,
 Prancer and Vixen.

688
01:18:03,475 --> 01:18:06,569
It's everything I dreamed it would be.

689
01:18:06,745 --> 01:18:08,542
Could all--?.

690
01:18:08,714 --> 01:18:11,649
Could all this be nothing but a dream?.

691
01:18:11,817 --> 01:18:13,375
No.

692
01:18:25,664 --> 01:18:28,098
To the top of the roof
To the top of the wall

693
01:18:28,267 --> 01:18:33,102
Now, dash away, dash away
Dash away all

694
01:19:05,571 --> 01:19:08,472
All aboard!

695
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:10,540
One, two. One, two, three, go.

696
01:19:10,709 --> 01:19:14,577
Rockin ' on top of the world
Rockin ' on top of the world

697
01:19:14,747 --> 01:19:16,942
The place is hoppin '
There ain 't no stoppin '

698
01:19:17,116 --> 01:19:20,984
Rockin ' on top of the world
Lift your spirits, swing that girl

699
01:19:21,153 --> 01:19:23,815
Rockin ' on top of the world
Tonight, yeah

700
01:19:23,989 --> 01:19:26,321
Come on, shorty!

701
01:19:39,371 --> 01:19:41,771
Show your tickets.
Have your tickets ready.

702
01:19:41,940 --> 01:19:44,500
Remember to eat
the five basic food groups.

703
01:19:44,676 --> 01:19:46,473
Ticket, please.

704
01:19:46,645 --> 01:19:49,910
And please brush after every meal.

705
01:19:53,052 --> 01:19:55,452
Remember to duck and cocer.

706
01:19:55,621 --> 01:19:57,248
All right, you. Ticket, please.

707
01:20:05,127 --> 01:20:07,721
"" Lean."" Whatever that's
supposed to mean.

708
01:20:07,897 --> 01:20:10,195
"" Lean"" is spelled with four letters.

709
01:20:10,366 --> 01:20:12,596
I belieced I punched fice.

710
01:20:14,804 --> 01:20:17,637
Hey, are you saying
I don't know how to--?.

711
01:20:17,807 --> 01:20:21,072
I'm sorry. It says "learn." My mistake.

712
01:20:21,243 --> 01:20:23,143
Lesson learned.

713
01:20:23,312 --> 01:20:24,711
Ticket.

714
01:20:41,530 --> 01:20:43,020
That is some special ticket.

715
01:20:43,199 --> 01:20:44,689
Sure is.

716
01:20:44,867 --> 01:20:49,133
So can you count on us
to get you home safe and sound?.

717
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:52,969
Absolutely.

718
01:20:53,142 --> 01:20:54,632
Me...

719
01:20:55,911 --> 01:20:57,936
...and my friends.

720
01:21:00,683 --> 01:21:01,911
Ticket.

721
01:21:10,459 --> 01:21:13,519
It says "lead." Like "lead balloon."

722
01:21:13,696 --> 01:21:16,358
I beliece it also is pronounced "lead."

723
01:21:16,532 --> 01:21:18,500
As in "leader," "leadership."

724
01:21:18,667 --> 01:21:20,897
""Lead the way.""

725
01:21:21,070 --> 01:21:23,265
Follow you anywhere, ma'am.

726
01:21:26,142 --> 01:21:27,439
Ah, yes.

727
01:21:27,610 --> 01:21:30,579
Young man with all the questions.

728
01:21:31,046 --> 01:21:32,479
Ticket.

729
01:21:42,525 --> 01:21:44,720
It says--

730
01:21:44,994 --> 01:21:46,621
It's nothing I need to know.

731
01:21:57,589 --> 01:21:59,955
-Come on, let's see the bell.
-Let's see it.

732
01:22:00,125 --> 01:22:02,821
-Come on, let's see the bell.
-Show us the bell.

733
01:22:02,994 --> 01:22:05,155
Yeah, let's see the bell.

734
01:22:12,471 --> 01:22:14,200
It's gone.

735
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:18,273
-Where is it?.
-I lost it.

736
01:22:18,443 --> 01:22:21,003
I lost the bell from Santa's sleigh.

737
01:22:21,179 --> 01:22:23,010
It's gone?.

738
01:22:24,349 --> 01:22:25,680
Don't worry.

739
01:22:25,851 --> 01:22:28,285
-We'll-- We'll find it.
-Yeah, we'll find it.

740
01:22:28,453 --> 01:22:30,785
Yeah, we'll help you. All of us.

741
01:22:30,956 --> 01:22:33,789
Yeah, let's hurry out
and find it right now.

742
01:22:43,301 --> 01:22:45,030
It's too late.

743
01:22:46,538 --> 01:22:49,029
Gee, that's really too bad.

744
01:22:50,075 --> 01:22:51,702
Really.

745
01:23:06,258 --> 01:23:08,055
I'm sorry.

746
01:23:38,957 --> 01:23:42,950
1 1344 Edbrooke.

747
01:23:43,128 --> 01:23:48,566
Next stop, 1 1 244 Edbrooke.

748
01:23:55,874 --> 01:23:57,774
Hey, where you going?.

749
01:23:58,810 --> 01:23:59,902
Home.

750
01:24:00,078 --> 01:24:03,673
Oh, okay. Merry Christmas.

751
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:11,621
Thanks for stopping the train for me.

752
01:24:17,462 --> 01:24:19,089
Hace a wonderful Christmas.

753
01:24:21,199 --> 01:24:23,690
Watch your step, please.

754
01:24:25,303 --> 01:24:27,294
And merry Christmas.

755
01:24:44,322 --> 01:24:45,619
Look.

756
01:24:48,293 --> 01:24:51,160
Santa got to Billy's house already.

757
01:24:53,965 --> 01:24:56,729
Look, look! Santa got here!

758
01:24:56,901 --> 01:24:58,459
Isn't that amazing?.

759
01:24:58,637 --> 01:25:00,070
It is amazing.

760
01:25:07,445 --> 01:25:09,572
It is amazing.

761
01:25:55,927 --> 01:25:58,191
I'm sorry about the bell.

762
01:25:58,797 --> 01:26:01,459
It was a really special present.

763
01:26:01,633 --> 01:26:03,362
Well, you know what they say.

764
01:26:03,535 --> 01:26:05,833
It's the thought that counts.

765
01:26:06,504 --> 01:26:07,971
Yeah.

766
01:26:09,140 --> 01:26:12,007
Well, see you.

767
01:26:14,612 --> 01:26:16,136
Well...

768
01:26:16,781 --> 01:26:18,373
...see you.

769
01:26:19,250 --> 01:26:20,774
See you.

770
01:26:34,566 --> 01:26:37,057
Watch your step, please.

771
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:39,564
Thank you.

772
01:26:39,738 --> 01:26:42,263
No, thank you.

773
01:26:44,042 --> 01:26:45,839
One thing about trains:

774
01:26:46,010 --> 01:26:48,069
It doesn't matter 
where they're going.

775
01:26:48,246 --> 01:26:52,273
What matters is deciding to get on.

776
01:27:09,267 --> 01:27:10,757
Merry Christmas!

777
01:27:14,472 --> 01:27:15,700
What?.

778
01:27:16,841 --> 01:27:21,369
Merry Christmas!

779
01:28:29,881 --> 01:28:34,284
Wake up. Wake up.
Santa's been here. Santa's been here.

780
01:28:34,452 --> 01:28:36,113
Hurry up. Hurry up!

781
01:28:36,287 --> 01:28:39,620
Mom, Dad, wake up. Wake up!

782
01:28:39,791 --> 01:28:42,783
Santa's been here! 
Santa's been here!

783
01:28:42,961 --> 01:28:46,863
Mom, Dad, look!
He brought us all kinds of stuff!

784
01:28:47,031 --> 01:28:49,591
Look, a train!

785
01:29:05,984 --> 01:29:11,479
This is the beautiful-est,
most wonderful-est Christmas ever.

786
01:29:11,656 --> 01:29:13,920
Wait. Look.

787
01:29:15,226 --> 01:29:17,126
Here's one more.

788
01:29:18,663 --> 01:29:20,528
Has your name on it.

789
01:29:49,442 --> 01:29:51,933
found this on the seat of my sleigh.

790
01:29:52,112 --> 01:29:54,774
Better fix that hole in your pocket.

791
01:29:54,948 --> 01:29:56,176
Mr. C.

792
01:30:06,309 --> 01:30:09,472
Oh, what a beautiful bell.
Who's it from?.

793
01:30:09,646 --> 01:30:11,705
-Santa.
-Santa?.

794
01:30:11,881 --> 01:30:13,473
Really?.

795
01:30:14,550 --> 01:30:16,950
-Oh, that's too bad.
-What's this?.

796
01:30:17,987 --> 01:30:19,477
Broken.

797
01:30:20,623 --> 01:30:22,784
Sorry about that, sport.

798
01:30:27,330 --> 01:30:30,458
Come on, kids. 
We don't wanna be late.

799
01:30:38,541 --> 01:30:42,033
At one time, most of my friends
could hear the bell.

800
01:30:42,211 --> 01:30:46,238
But as years passed,
it fell silent for all of them.

801
01:30:46,416 --> 01:30:51,683
Even Sarah found, one Christmas, 
that she could no longer
 hear its sweet sound.

802
01:30:51,854 --> 01:30:53,515
Though I've grown old...

803
01:30:53,690 --> 01:30:56,090
... the bell still rings for me.

804
01:30:56,259 --> 01:31:00,320
As it does for all who truly believe.
