1
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:50,008
<i>On Christmas Eve, many years ago...</i>

2
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,636
<i>...I lay quietly in my bed.</i>

3
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:55,138
<i>I did not rustle the sheets.</i>

4
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:58,600
<i>I breathed slowly and silently.</i>

5
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:04,481
<i>I was listening for a sound
I was afraid I'd never hear.</i>

6
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:09,945
<i>The ringing bells of Santa's sleigh.</i>

7
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:41,578
All right. All right, Sarah,
you had your water.

8
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:43,789
Now let's get you upstairs
and into bed.

9
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:46,583
But-- But-- But, I have to--

10
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:52,047
He said Santa would have to
fly faster than light...

11
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:56,051
...to get to every house in one night.
And to hold everyone's presents...

12
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:58,929
...his sled would be bigger
than an ocean liner.

13
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:03,100
Your brother said that? He was just
kidding you. He knows there's a Santa.

14
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:06,937
He said he wasn't sure.
He wasn't sure if Santa was for real.

15
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:10,148
Of course Santa is real.
He's as real as Christmas itself.

16
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:13,944
But he won't come until you're
sound asleep, young lady.

17
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:16,780
Sweet dreams.

18
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:19,950
Santa will be here before you know it.

19
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:22,119
So go to sleep.

20
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,999
"Stark, barren.

21
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,713
Devoid of life."

22
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,893
He's gotta be asleep by now.

23
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:32,105
He used to stay awake all night
waiting for Santa.

24
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:35,859
Think those days are just about over.

25
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:37,944
That would be sad if that were true.

26
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,615
Yeah, an end of the magic.

27
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:45,368
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

28
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,586
See, he's out like a light.

29
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:57,923
An express train
wouldn't wake him up now.

30
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:03,637
<i>"End of the magic"?</i>

31
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:19,022
All aboard!

32
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:26,196
All aboard!

33
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,559
Well? You coming?

34
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,062
Where?

35
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:01,398
Why, to the North Pole, of course.

36
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:05,402
This is the Polar Express.

37
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:08,071
The North Pole'?

38
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,199
I see.

39
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:12,742
Hold this, please.

40
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,869
Thank you.

41
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:17,497
Is this you?

42
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,126
- Yeah.
-Well, it says here...

43
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:25,964
...no photo with a department-store
Santa this year, no letter to Santa.

44
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:29,801
And you made your sister
put out the milk and cookies.

45
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:32,637
Sounds to me like
this is your crucial year.

46
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:37,183
If I were you, I would think
about climbing on board.

47
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:44,441
Come on, come on.
I've got a schedule to keep.

48
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:49,487
Suit yourself.

49
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,510
<i>'Cause that's the way things happen
On the Polar Express</i>

50
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,679
<i>Whoo, Whoo, the whistle blows
That's the sound of her singing</i>

51
00:09:56,846 --> 00:10:00,100
<i>Ding, ding, the bell will ring
Golly, look at her go</i>

52
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:03,686
<i>You wonder if we'll get there soon
Anybody's guess</i>

53
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:07,107
<i>'Cause that's the way things happen
On the Polar Express</i>

54
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:10,860
<i>When we get there
We'll scream, "Yay!"</i>

55
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,279
<i>We'll arrive with
A bang, bang, bang</i>

56
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,698
<i>Boom, boom, boom
Laughing all the way</i>

57
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:19,035
<i>With a comfy seat and lots to eat
Boy, it's just the best</i>

58
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:22,413
<i>Wish it wouldn't ever have to end</i>

59
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,375
<i>With a little luck, we'll be on time
There's no need to stress</i>

60
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:30,046
<i>'Cause that's the way things happen
On the Polar Express</i>

61
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:36,553
Hey. Hey, you. Yeah, you.
Do you know what kind of train this is?

62
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:41,224
Train. Do you know what kind of train
this is? Do you?

63
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:44,727
Of course.

64
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,063
It's a magic train.

65
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:50,525
- We're going to the North Pole.
-I know it's a magic train.

66
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:53,278
It's a Baldwin 2-8-4 S3-class
steam locomotive...

67
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:58,366
...built in 1931 at the Baldwin Locomotive
Works. It weighs 456,100 pounds and...

68
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,743
Are we really going to the North Pole?

69
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,246
- Hey, look!
-isn't that wonderful?

70
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:07,041
Herpolsheimer's! Herp0lsheimer's!

71
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:14,799
Wow, look at all those presents.
I want all of them.

72
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:19,053
It's so Christmassy and cozy
and beautiful!

73
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:26,477
Tickets.

74
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,063
Tickets, please.

75
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,815
Tickets.

76
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:35,236
Ticket, please.

77
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,780
Try your pocket.

78
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,789
Try your other pocket.

79
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,475
Thank you, sir.

80
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,070
Hey, watch out, there.

81
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,905
Thank you, sir.

82
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:23,284
That is a public-address microphone.
It is not a toy.

83
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,536
Boy, that guy sure likes to show off.

84
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:28,498
Look what that wise guy
punched on my ticket.

85
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:34,504
"L-E." What the heck does that mean?
-Next stop, 11344 Edbrooke.

86
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:38,216
We're heading for the other side
of the tracks.

87
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:56,943
Well? You coming?

88
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,861
It's just another pickup.

89
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:02,490
That's weird. I thought you were
supposed to be the last one.

90
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:04,867
Why, to the North Pole, of course.

91
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,870
This is the Polar Express.

92
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:13,042
Suit yourself.

93
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:45,158
Hey, that kid wants
to get on the train.

94
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,077
Come on!

95
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:52,081
Hurry UP!

96
00:13:58,463 --> 00:13:59,922
We have to stop the train.

97
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,592
- I don't know how.
-Pull the emergency brake!

98
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,458
Who in the blazes applied
that emergency brake?!

99
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,043
He did.

100
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,961
You.

101
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:44,300
In case you didn't know, that cord
is for emergency purposes only.

102
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:49,222
And in case you weren't aware,
tonight is Christmas Eve.

103
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:53,476
And in case you hadn't noticed,
this train is on a very tight schedule.

104
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:57,605
Now, young man, Christmas
may not be important to some people...

105
00:14:57,772 --> 00:15:01,234
...but it is very important
to the rest of us!

106
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,902
But-- But--

107
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:06,656
He was just trying to stop the train
so that kid could get on.

108
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:12,328
I see. Young man,
is that what happened?

109
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,793
Well...

110
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:22,755
Let me remind you we are
on a very tight schedule.

111
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,174
And I've never been late before...

112
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:28,094
...and I am certainly not
going to be late tonight.

113
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:32,265
Now, everybody, take your seats, please!

114
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,353
Thank you.

115
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,692
Your attention, please.

116
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:47,363
Are there any Polar Express passengers
in need of refreshment?

117
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:50,491
- Me! Me! Me!
-I thought so.

118
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,543

<i>Yeah, we got it</i>

149
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,382
You know, Montezuma,
the king of the Aztecs...

150
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:33,135
...would drink 50 quarts
of hot chocolate every day.

151
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:36,973
It was thick as mud and red.
He put chili pepper in instead of sugar.

152
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:40,518
- Get it? Hot chocolate?
-How do you know? That's not true.

153
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:43,479
- Where you going with that?
-it's for him.

154
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:48,025
- I don't think we're to leave our seats.
-it's a violation of safety regulations...

155
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:51,320
...for a kid to cross moving cars
without a grown-up.

156
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:53,072
I think I'll be Okay.

157
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,658
Are you sure?

158
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,629
What about this lad in the back?
Did he get any refreshment?

159
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,842
Well, let's take some to him,
by all means.

160
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:19,390
Watch your step, now. Watch your step.

161
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,520
She forgot her ticket.

162
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:27,064
It hasn't been punched.

163
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:31,068
What are you doing?
You're gonna get us in trouble!

164
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:05,181
Young lady, forgive me.

165
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:08,893
I believe I have neglected
to punch your ticket.

166
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,895
May I?

167
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:15,858
I left my ticket right here on the seat.

168
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,360
- But it's gone.
-You mean...

169
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:20,780
...you have lost your ticket.

170
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,865
She didn't lose her ticket.

171
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,826
I did.

172
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:29,538
I was trying to return it to you.

173
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:32,541
But the wind blew it out of my hand.

174
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,421
You can have my ticket.

175
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:45,721
These tickets are not transferable.

176
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:47,723
Young lady...

177
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,976
...you will just have to
come along with me.

178
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:04,448
You know what's gonna happen now?
He's gonna throw her off the train.

179
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:07,576
He's gonna probably throw her
off the rear platform.

180
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:11,288
Standard procedure. That way,
she won't get sucked under the wheels.

181
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:14,708
They may slow the train down,
but they're never gonna stop it.

182
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,085
Stop it?

183
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:19,088
That's it! I have to stop the train again.

184
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:21,507
No, please, don't do that again.

185
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:54,748
Where'd they go?

186
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:56,834
What happened to them?

187
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:59,962
Please, she's in big trouble.
You have to help me.

188
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,251
Hey!

189
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:44,173
Hey!

190
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:48,052
I found your ticket! Wait!

191
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:52,014
Hey!

192
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:54,516
Wait!

193
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:57,102
I have your ticket!

194
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,391
Is there something I can do for you?

195
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,559
I'm looking for a girl.

196
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:39,770
A 9i»?

197
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,152
Ain't we all?

198
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,822
I have her ticket.

199
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:53,492
Well, lookie. Lookie here. What is this?

200
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:58,247
This is an official, authentic,
genuine ticket to ride.

201
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:01,917
You better keep this
in a safe place, young man.

202
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:03,502
If I was you...

203
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:06,338
I keep all my valuables right here.

204
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,674
Right here in the old size 13.

205
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:11,093
Experience shows
this is the safest place.

206
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:14,596
Not that I have much use for those.

207
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,015
Tickets.

208
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,766
I ride for free.

209
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:22,771
Oh, yeah, yeah. I hop aboard this rattler
any time I feels like it.

210
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,982
I own this train. Oh, yeah.

211
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:29,611
It's like I'm the king of this train.
Yeah. The king of the Pol Ex.

212
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:35,868
In fact, I am the king
of the North Pole!

213
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,913
Oh, where's my manners? Sit, sit. Sit.

214
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,749
Take a load off.

215
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:44,251
Hey, would you like some Joe?

216
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:49,965
Nice hot refreshment.
Perfect for a cold winter's night.

217
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,852
There. Bless you.

218
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,981
What about Santa?

219
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:09,818
- Santa?
-isn't he the king of the North Pole?

220
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:13,197
You mean this guy?

221
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:33,008
What exactly is your persuasion
on the big man?

222
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:34,510
Since you brought him up.

223
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:38,847
Well, l...

224
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:41,141
I want to believe.

225
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:45,062
- But--
-But you don't wanna be bamboozled.

226
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:48,315
You don't wanna be
led down the primrose path.

227
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:52,694
You don't wanna be conned or duped,
have the wool pulled over your eyes.

228
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:56,990
Hoodwinked. You don't wanna be
taken for a ride, railroaded.

229
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:03,872
Seeing is believing.

230
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:05,833
Am I right?

231
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,336
But what about this train?

232
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:12,381
What about it?

233
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:15,509
We're all really going
to the North Pole...

234
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:16,885
...aren't we?

235
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:19,471
Aren't we?

236
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:24,852
Are you saying
that this is all just a dream?

237
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:28,647
You said it, kid. Not me.

238
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:36,155
So let's go find that girl.

239
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:44,538
One other thing.

240
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,958
Do you believe in ghosts?

241
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,547
Interesting.

242
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,718
Wait.

243
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:01,388
Wait!

244
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,897
Wait!

245
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,445
I have to wake up.

246
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:18,655
Yeah. I have to wake up.

247
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:22,242
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.

248
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:24,661
Wake up!

249
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,722
Kid!

250
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:46,099
Kid, get your head out of the clouds!

251
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:47,809
Wake up, kid!

252
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:51,772
There's no sleepwalking
on the Polar Express.

253
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,608
We gotta jump them knuckles.

254
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:59,279
Come on, kid. Flip my shoulders.

255
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:01,281
Grab my lily.

256
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:06,411
That skirt you're chasing
must have moved ahead.

257
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:10,999
- We gotta hightail it to the hog, pronto.
-To the hog?

258
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:15,170
The engine. The engine, you tenderfoot.

259
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:18,548
We gotta make the engine
before we hit Flat Top Tunnel.

260
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:20,384
How come?

261
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:23,178
So many questions.

262
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:27,933
There is but one inch of clearance
between the roof of this rattler...

263
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,978
...and the roof of Flat Top Tunnel.

264
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:33,021
Savvy?

265
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:39,194
It's just the run up to the hump, kid.

266
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,697
This will be interesting.

267
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,596
Get back on, kid. Hurry!

268
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:09,057
Grab my muck stick.

269
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,262
There's only one trick to this, kid.

270
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,931
When I say "jump"...

271
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:56,271
...you jump!

272
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:22,255
You. I thought you got thrown off, and--

273
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:25,467
- You're driving the train?
-They put me in charge.

274
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:29,054
- The engineer had to check the light.
-Here's the light. Careful.

275
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:30,889
All right, now.

276
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,518
I got it.

277
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:40,732
- How do you know how'?
-it's easy. Come here, I'll show you.

278
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,360
This big lever here, that's the throttle.

279
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:45,654
This little one here, that's the brake.

280
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:48,698
And those are the pressure gauges.

281
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:51,451
And that rope is the whistle.

282
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,829
The whistle.

283
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:56,540
You wanna try it?

284
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:02,379
I've wanted to do that my whole life.

285
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:09,094
Hold still! Hold still! Don't move!

286
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:11,304
Look!

287
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:26,987
Stop the train! Stop the train!

288
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:29,865
Stop the train!

289
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:34,536
What?

290
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:37,372
They want us to stop the train.

291
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:40,000
- Which one is the brake?
-He told me this was.

292
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:41,877
- Who?
-The engineer.

293
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:46,673
- The engineer? This one looks like a brake.
-No, he said this was the brake.

294
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,883
Are you sure?

295
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,677
Are you sure?

296
00:32:57,767 --> 00:33:00,479
Pull the brake!

297
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:02,564
Stop the train!

298
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:21,875
Caribou?

299
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:28,298
There can be no Christmas without
the Polar Express arriving on time.

300
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:31,760
Am I the only one who understands that?

301
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:34,721
You. I should have known.

302
00:33:34,888 --> 00:33:38,767
Are you bound and determined that
this train never reaches the North Pole?

303
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:40,519
But look.

304
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,438
Caribou crossing?!

305
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:48,026
I make that herd to be at least
100,000, maybe even a million.

306
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:51,279
It's gonna be hours
before they clear this track.

307
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:55,492
- A tough nut to crack.
-We are in some serious jelly.

308
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:58,119
- And a jam.
-Tight spot.

309
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,621
- Up a creek.
-Up a tree.

310
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:02,999
- Lost in the grass.
<i>- I'll</i> tell you what's grass: our a--

311
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:49,838
Problem solved. All ahead, slow.

312
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,719
We're going pretty fast.

313
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:40,764
Tell the engineer to slow down.

314
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:47,729
Slow it down.

315
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:52,359
Watch the speed!

316
00:35:57,405 --> 00:36:00,450
Jumping jeepers,
the cotter pin sheared off.

317
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:01,910
- What?
-The pin.

318
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:04,245
- Where?
-There.

319
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:05,955
- Oh, no.
-Oh, no.

320
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,918
- They can't hear me.
-They can't?

321
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,840
I don't like the look of this.
Under the safety bar.

322
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:19,886
Is everything all right?
What should we do?

323
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:24,516
Considering we've lost communication
with the engineer...

324
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:27,852
...we are standing totally exposed
on the front of the locomotive...

325
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:31,189
...the train appears to be
accelerating uncontrollably...

326
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:35,193
...and we are rapidly
approaching Glacier Gulch...

327
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,863
...which happens to be the steepest
downhill grade in the world...

328
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,325
...I suggest we all hold on...

329
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,120
...tigh'ily-

330
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,142
- The pin.
-The pin.

331
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:30,540
Jiminy Christmas, the ice has frozen
over the tracks.

332
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,106
Hold on. Hold on. No, no.

333
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:58,151
Come on. Watch your step.

334
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:01,529
Come on, sweetie.
Up you go. Up you go.

335
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:06,451
Put your feet on here. On here.

336
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:10,288
Little adventure, huh?

337
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:12,874
Young man, quick thinking on your part.

338
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:36,731
Step to your left, please. To your left.

339
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:44,072
Well, that is more like it.

340
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:49,160
What in the name of Mike?

341
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:53,748
Look.

342
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:59,128
Get us the blazes out of here!

343
00:39:07,387 --> 00:39:08,972
Turn this sled around.

344
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:28,867
Look there.

345
00:39:31,578 --> 00:39:32,912
Tracks.

346
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,497
Dead ahead.

347
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:41,462
Right.

348
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:48,303
Left.

349
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:54,809
Right.

350
00:39:58,688 --> 00:39:59,939
Hang a Louie.

351
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,444
Toss a Ritchie.

352
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,490
Port astern.

353
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,494
To the starboard.

354
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:17,373
- My slipper.
-You're gonna lose your ticket.

355
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,417
It's not my ticket, it's yours.

356
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:21,419
-It's my ticket?
-Yes.

357
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:23,713
Right. Keep up with me. Left.

358
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:26,466
Right. Left.

359
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:31,846
Right.

360
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,473
Left.

361
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,016
Right.

362
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:37,143
Left. Right.

363
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:42,148
- Oh, no!
-Oh, no!

364
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:46,194
Brace yourselves!

365
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:59,165
Well, that's more like it.

366
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:03,086
Thank you.

367
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:06,547
Thank you. I can't believe
you found my ticket.

368
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:09,717
Did someone say they found a ticket?

369
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:15,139
Well, in that case... Tickets, please.

370
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:25,566
Thank you.

371
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:31,197
_IIL_EII?
-Just like that know-it-all kid.

372
00:41:46,129 --> 00:41:48,715
Watch your step.
Tricky walking up here.

373
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:51,259
It's mighty slick.
Mighty slick, I tell you.

374
00:41:52,427 --> 00:41:54,971
There you go. What did I tell you?

375
00:41:55,138 --> 00:42:00,268
Years ago, on my first Christmas Eve run,
I was up on the roof making my rounds...

376
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:02,353
...when I slipped on the ice myself.

377
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,940
I reached out for a hand iron,
but it broke off. I slid and fell.

378
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:10,111
And yet, I did not fall off this train.

379
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:12,947
Someone saved you?

380
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:15,116
Or something.

381
00:42:17,994 --> 00:42:19,287
An angel.

382
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:21,873
Maybe.

383
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,125
Wait. Wait.

384
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:28,129
What did he look like? Did you see him?

385
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:33,134
No, sir. But sometimes
seeing is believing.

386
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:38,639
And sometimes the most real things
in the world are the things we can't see.

387
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:46,814
The forsaken and the abandoned.

388
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:51,986
Mind your step, now.
These poor toys have suffered enough...

389
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:56,491
...being left to rust and decay in the
back alleys and vacant lots of the world.

390
00:42:56,991 --> 00:43:01,162
- What are they doing here?
-it's a new concept the boss came up with.

391
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:04,707
Instead of being thrown away,
they're collected. Refurbished.

392
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:10,505
He calls it "rebicycling."
Something like that.

393
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:15,176
Makes me wanna cry...

394
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:18,513
...seeing toys that were
treated this way.

395
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:23,518
These hopelessly entangled
string puppets and marionettes...

396
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:27,980
...pose a particular problem. We found
the nimble fingers of our work force...

397
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:32,485
...here at the North Pole are best
for working out those knots and tangles.

398
00:43:32,652 --> 00:43:35,196
Thank you. Double-locked here.

399
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:50,044
You are just like me, my friend.

400
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:52,588
A scrooge!

401
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:54,924
Ebenezer Scrooge.

402
00:43:55,091 --> 00:43:58,427
North Pole, Santa Claus, this train...

403
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:02,515
...it's all a bunch of humbug.
A bout of indigestion.

404
00:44:02,682 --> 00:44:05,268
Oh, yeah. I know what you are.

405
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:08,062
You're a doubter.

406
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:10,773
A doubter. You don't believe!

407
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:14,110
You're a doubter! You don't believe!

408
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:34,130
You missed it.
We rode down some really sharp hills.

409
00:44:34,297 --> 00:44:38,676
We were on what looked like a frozen lake.
But I know it was just an optical illusion.

410
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:41,762
He said the train was on ice.
I said it's impossible--

411
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:44,640
You can't put a train track--
Where you going now?

412
00:44:59,155 --> 00:45:02,116
<i>I'm wishing on a star</i>

413
00:45:02,283 --> 00:45:05,453
<i>And trying to believe</i>

414
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:08,789
<i>That even though it's far</i>

415
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:11,792
<i>He'll find me Christmas Eve</i>

416
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:15,546
<i>I guess that Santa's busy</i>

417
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:18,716
<i>'Cause he's never come around</i>

418
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:24,972
<i>I think of him
When Christmas comes to town</i>

419
00:45:25,765 --> 00:45:28,935
<i>The best time of the year</i>

420
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:32,313
<i>When everyone comes home</i>

421
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,650
<i>With all this Christmas cheer</i>

422
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:39,362
<i>It's hard to be alone</i>

423
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:45,576
<i>Putting up the Christmas tree
With friends who come around</i>

424
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:52,124
<i>It's so much fun
When Christmas comes to town</i>

425
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:59,006
<i>Presents for the children
Wrapped in red and green</i>

426
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:05,346
<i>All the things I've heard about
But never really seen</i>

427
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,683
<i>No one will be sleeping</i>

428
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:11,936
<i>On the night of Christmas Eve</i>

429
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:19,193
<i>Hoping Santa's on his way</i>

430
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:22,446
<i>When Santa's sleighbells ring</i>

431
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:25,491
<i>I listen all around</i>

432
00:46:25,658 --> 00:46:28,869
<i>The herald angels sing</i>

433
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:32,039
<i>I never hear a sound</i>

434
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:36,043
<i>And all the dreams of children</i>

435
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:39,005
<i>Once lost will all be found</i>

436
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:45,094
<i>That's all I want
When Christmas comes to town</i>

437
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:56,147
<i>That's all I want
When Christmas comes to town</i>

438
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,118
Look.

439
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:13,789
The northern lights.

440
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:18,669
Hey. You three.

441
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:21,672
We just crossed it.

442
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:27,261
Latitude 66°33'.
The Arctic Circle.

443
00:47:27,428 --> 00:47:30,765
And do you see?
Those lights in the distance.

444
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:36,145
They look like the lights of a strange
ocean liner sailing on a frozen sea.

445
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:39,440
There...

446
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:42,151
...is the North Pole.

447
00:47:47,156 --> 00:47:49,992
<i>It's a magic carpet on a rail
It never takes a rest</i>

448
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:53,329
<i>Flying through
The mountains and the snow</i>

449
00:47:53,496 --> 00:47:56,457
<i>You can ride for free and join the fun
If you just say yes</i>

450
00:47:56,624 --> 00:47:59,960
<i>'Cause that's the way things happen
On the Polar Express</i>

451
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:03,255
<i>Whoo, Whoo, the whistle blows
That's the sound of her singing</i>

452
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:06,634
<i>Ding, ding, the bell will ring
Golly, look at her go</i>

453
00:48:06,801 --> 00:48:09,804
<i>You wonder if you'll get there soon
Anybody's guess</i>

454
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:13,182
<i>'Cause that's the way things happen
On the Polar Express</i>

455
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:16,477
<i>When we get there
We'll scream, "Yay!"</i>

456
00:48:16,644 --> 00:48:18,979
<i>We'll arrive with
A bang, bang, bang</i>

457
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:22,149
<i>Boom, boom, boom
Laughing all the way</i>

458
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:30,074
We made it. With five minutes to spare.

459
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:32,118
We made it.

460
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,854
There should be elves.
Where are the elves?

461
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,689
Yeah, where are the elves?

462
00:49:01,856 --> 00:49:04,191
They are gathering
in the center of the city.

463
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:08,154
That is where Santa will give
the first gift of Christmas.

464
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:11,490
Who gets the first gift of Christmas?

465
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:15,536
He will choose one of you.

466
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:21,542
- Look.
-Elves!

467
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:54,742
All right. All right,
ladies and gentlemen.

468
00:49:54,909 --> 00:49:57,620
Two columns, if you please.

469
00:49:57,786 --> 00:50:00,581
Shorter in the front, taller in the rear.

470
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:04,710
Even-numbered birthdays on the right,
odd-numbered on the left.

471
00:50:04,877 --> 00:50:07,796
No pushing. No pushing.
But let's not dilly-dally.

472
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:09,882
It's five minutes to midnight.

473
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:13,636
Hey, what gives? It was five minutes
till midnight four minutes ago.

474
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:16,597
Exactly. Columns of two.

475
00:50:16,764 --> 00:50:18,891
- One, two.
-Excuse me.

476
00:50:19,058 --> 00:50:21,519
- Question.
-What about him?

477
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:26,982
No one is required to see Santa.

478
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:31,320
Ladies and gentlemen,
you do not have to hold hands...

479
00:50:31,487 --> 00:50:34,949
- Come on.
-...but please remain in your columns...

480
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:37,493
...while we are in transit.

481
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:50,631
- Look, you have to come with us.
-She's right.

482
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:57,012
Christmas just doesn't work out
for me. Never has.

483
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:59,807
But Christmas is such a wonderful,
beautiful time.

484
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:03,602
It's a time for giving and being thankful,
for friends and family.

485
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:08,566
People hang decorations and lights. Santa
leaves presents under our Christmas trees.

486
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:12,236
Christmas just...

487
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:14,697
...doesn't work out for me.

488
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:20,202
Look, I don't know if Christmas
is gonna work out for you or not...

489
00:51:20,369 --> 00:51:23,497
...but this is Christmas Eve.
Don't stay here by yourself.

490
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:26,709
Yes, come with us.

491
00:51:27,251 --> 00:51:29,044
We'll go together.

492
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:42,766
Oh, no.

493
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:52,693
We're gonna be okay.

494
00:51:55,029 --> 00:51:57,156
Maybe not!

495
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:00,993
The emergency brake.

496
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,120
The emergency brake.

497
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:10,628
There's no brake. I can't find the brake!

498
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:19,720
Take a break, kid.

499
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:23,557
How about a nice, good hot cup of Joe?

500
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:53,253
We're gonna crash!

501
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,179
We're spinning.

502
00:53:27,955 --> 00:53:29,915
You hear that?

503
00:53:30,499 --> 00:53:31,792
The bell.

504
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:35,546
- What bell?
-The sleighbell.

505
00:53:35,713 --> 00:53:38,132
- Sleighbell?
-Don't you hear it?

506
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:42,010
It's coming from that tunnel.

507
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:49,685
That's the way we should go.

508
00:53:58,152 --> 00:53:59,695
Come on.

509
00:54:31,894 --> 00:54:33,479
What?

510
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:36,648
- What?
-Come on.

511
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:49,661
Come on.

512
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:01,256
We're lost.

513
00:55:11,225 --> 00:55:12,643
Yes.

514
00:55:13,894 --> 00:55:16,814
- Yes. I hear it.
-I hear it too.

515
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:21,068
- I don't hear anything.
-Okay, it's down this way.

516
00:55:21,235 --> 00:55:22,444
Are you sure?

517
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:28,283
Absolutely.

518
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:36,583
Why can't I hear anything?

519
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:41,797
Get down and be quiet.

520
00:55:50,931 --> 00:55:52,266
Yeah.

521
00:55:55,269 --> 00:55:56,812
0K8)'-

522
00:55:57,729 --> 00:55:59,857
Well, that was the wrapping hall, chief.

523
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:02,609
- Just finished the last one.
-How's it wrapped?

524
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:06,697
It's wrapped in candy-striped red
with a number-seven holly-green bow.

525
00:56:06,864 --> 00:56:10,158
A number-seven bow?
When we're this close to liftoff?

526
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:13,787
What are they thinking down there?
Are they meshuggener?

527
00:56:13,954 --> 00:56:16,206
- What's the routing?
-Going to the States.

528
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:18,584
Grand Rapids, Michigan.

529
00:56:19,126 --> 00:56:22,129
That's my town. I'm from Grand Rapids.

530
00:56:27,426 --> 00:56:30,470
We got a troublemaker now.
Just what we need.

531
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:33,557
Things aren't bad enough.
What's his 20?

532
00:56:33,724 --> 00:56:37,019
Apparently, some kid
from Maplewood, New Jersey...

533
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:39,605
...stuck some gum in his sister's hair.

534
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,525
New Jersey? Is that the same kid
that put the tack...

535
00:56:43,859 --> 00:56:48,697
...underneath his teacher's chair last year?
-No, sir. This kid's name is Steven.

536
00:56:49,865 --> 00:56:52,826
So, what do we do, chief?
Alert the big man?

537
00:56:52,993 --> 00:56:55,996
We talking nothing for Christmas here?

538
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:04,212
<i>I didn't do it.</i>

539
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,632
<i>I didn't do it.</i>

540
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:08,550
<i>I didn't do it.</i>

541
00:57:10,886 --> 00:57:13,347
Look, it's...
It's almost Christmas, huh?

542
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:15,682
We'll cut the kid a break.

543
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:18,143
But put him on the check-twice list
for next year.

544
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:20,979
All right, boys.

545
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:24,274
Let's shut it down.
That's it for this year. Come on.

546
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:28,987
- Hey, boss, are we taking the pneumatic?
-Of course we're taking the pneumatic.

547
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:32,324
It's the only way to get
to the square on time.

548
00:57:32,491 --> 00:57:35,744
- Let's go.
-And time is money.

549
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:39,122
Ready, and mount.

550
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:43,210
Good. Close.

551
00:57:57,766 --> 00:57:59,601
All right, get in.

552
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:03,188
I don't know about this.

553
00:58:38,098 --> 00:58:40,934
I don't hear it. Do you?

554
00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:43,895
No.

555
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:48,025
I think we should follow those arrows.

556
00:59:02,289 --> 00:59:04,750
I thought there'd be a way out.

557
00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:07,127
We're gonna miss everything.

558
00:59:17,137 --> 00:59:18,764
Hey, look.

559
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:21,767
A present.

560
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:29,107
It's going to my town.
To someone named Billy.

561
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:34,863
- My name is Billy.
-it's going to 11344 Edbrooke Avenue.

562
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:36,907
That's my address.

563
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:46,291
Come on.

564
01:00:46,393 --> 01:00:47,727
Look.

565
01:00:49,271 --> 01:00:52,732
It says, "Merry Christmas, Billy.
From Mr. C."

566
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:58,113
I think I know what it is.
I wanted one of these my whole life.

567
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:01,408
Wait, wait. Stop. Look.

568
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:05,620
But l...

569
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:07,622
Those are the rules.

570
01:03:08,535 --> 01:03:10,203
Something's got me.

571
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:12,080
It's got my leg-

572
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:13,999
I can't hold him.

573
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:17,460
Give me your other hand.
Give me your other hand.

574
01:03:17,836 --> 01:03:20,171
- I can't.
-On three.

575
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:23,466
One, two, three.

576
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:26,219
- Look.
-it's still got me.

577
01:03:26,386 --> 01:03:29,723
On three again. One, two, three.

578
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:34,561
- You.
-You.

579
01:03:34,728 --> 01:03:36,771
- What are you doing here?
-Same as you.

580
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:40,525
Checking my presents. Making sure
I'm getting everything on my list.

581
01:03:40,692 --> 01:03:43,611
I found one present.
All it had was stupid underwear.

582
01:03:43,778 --> 01:03:45,405
Look.

583
01:03:53,955 --> 01:03:56,166
<i>You may start your descent
any time now.</i>

584
01:03:56,333 --> 01:03:58,585
<i>At your convenience, of course.</i>

585
01:04:10,764 --> 01:04:14,184
It's still five to.
I think we're gonna make it.

586
01:04:14,351 --> 01:04:16,978
Of course. It's been five to
for the last hour.

587
01:04:17,145 --> 01:04:20,732
We got plenty of time. We got nothing
but time. We got time to kill.

588
01:04:20,899 --> 01:04:24,652
You know what?
I don't think we're gonna make it.

589
01:04:27,072 --> 01:04:30,200
I may be just an old railroader...

590
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:33,161
...and know nothing about
lighter-than-air craft...

591
01:04:33,328 --> 01:04:38,833
...but from my layman's perspective,
you need more altitude!

592
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,461
More altitude!

593
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:45,131
<i>Altitude, please. A bit more altitude, please.</i>

594
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:48,301
Geronimo!

595
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:05,193
The Flying Elves.

596
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:08,154
They are specialists.
Do not try that at home, kids.

597
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:10,281
Do not try that at home.

598
01:05:10,448 --> 01:05:11,699
We're not gonna make it.

599
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:53,575
A well-oiled machine.

600
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:06,212
All right, you stowaways.

601
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:09,799
- Party's over.
-I was just following them.

602
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:11,885
We fell in here by mistake.

603
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:15,763
Forget about it. We knew you
was in there the whole time.

604
01:06:17,682 --> 01:06:19,058
Come on, out you go.

605
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:22,937
Let's go, come on.
Step up, step up. There we go.

606
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:26,357
Not a problem. Come on.
Watch your step. There you go.

607
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:35,575
So nobody gets hurt, here's
how we're gonna get you guys down.

608
01:06:35,742 --> 01:06:39,078
- This is simple. Why, I know--
-What do you know?

609
01:06:39,412 --> 01:06:42,916
You're not supposed to be here
in the first place.

610
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:47,587
But since it's Christmas,
I'm gonna let you slide.

611
01:06:47,754 --> 01:06:48,755
H9)'-

612
01:06:51,299 --> 01:06:52,634
Been looking for you.

613
01:06:55,762 --> 01:06:57,138
There you go.

614
01:06:57,305 --> 01:06:58,556
Watch your step.

615
01:06:58,723 --> 01:07:00,642
Careful.

616
01:07:00,808 --> 01:07:02,894
Beautiful form. Beautiful.

617
01:07:03,061 --> 01:07:05,438
Nice to see you again.

618
01:07:07,315 --> 01:07:10,068
Cutting it kind of close, aren't we?

619
01:07:10,235 --> 01:07:13,821
I'll take care of this.

620
01:07:13,988 --> 01:07:16,115
It's in good hands.

621
01:07:16,282 --> 01:07:18,952
Trust me.

622
01:07:47,355 --> 01:07:50,984
<i>It's the spirit of the season</i>

623
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:54,696
<i>You can feel it in the air</i>

624
01:07:54,862 --> 01:07:58,616
<i>You can hear it if you listen</i>

625
01:07:58,783 --> 01:08:02,453
<i>Everywhere
So much care</i>

626
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:04,330
<i>Like a prayer</i>

627
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:08,167
<i>Whatever it is
You need to share it</i>

628
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:13,506
<i>It's the spirit of the season</i>

629
01:08:23,016 --> 01:08:28,021
<i>It's the spirit of the season</i>

630
01:08:32,525 --> 01:08:36,904
<i>You can feel it in the air</i>

631
01:08:50,293 --> 01:08:53,421
Aren't those bells
the most beautiful sound?

632
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:11,165
He's here! He's here!

633
01:10:11,332 --> 01:10:12,583
Where?

634
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:15,128
I see him. He's over there.

635
01:10:15,294 --> 01:10:16,796
I can't see him.

636
01:10:36,983 --> 01:10:38,985
I can't see him.

637
01:10:39,152 --> 01:10:41,946
I can't see him!

638

I believe.

643
01:12:33,975 --> 01:12:36,269
What was that you said?

644
01:12:40,565 --> 01:12:43,442
L-- I believe.

645
01:12:47,738 --> 01:12:49,782
I believe.

646
01:12:51,659 --> 01:12:55,913
L-- I believe that this is yours.

647
01:12:57,540 --> 01:12:59,125
Well...

648
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:02,211
Thank you.

649
01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:05,631
- Me, me. Pick me, Santa.
-What are you doing? Stop it.

650
01:13:05,798 --> 01:13:08,885
- Pick me, pick me. I want the first gift.
-Hush.

651
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:11,012
Young man...

652
01:13:11,178 --> 01:13:13,014
...patience.

653
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:17,852
And a smidgen of humility
might also serve you well.

654
01:13:18,019 --> 01:13:19,645
Yes, sir.

655
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:23,274
And you, young lady...

656
01:13:23,441 --> 01:13:25,151
A lady of decision.

657
01:13:25,318 --> 01:13:29,238
Full of confidence and spirit.

658
01:13:29,989 --> 01:13:31,616
Christmas spirit.

659
01:13:34,452 --> 01:13:35,995
Keep up the good work.

660
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:39,040
Thank you.

661
01:13:39,999 --> 01:13:41,626
And Billy.

662
01:13:43,127 --> 01:13:44,837
<i>N</i> is Billy?

663
01:13:46,672 --> 01:13:49,216
I see you've made some new friends.

664
01:13:51,928 --> 01:13:53,471
Yes, sir. I sure have.

665
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:55,890
That's a lucky lad.

666
01:13:56,057 --> 01:13:58,517
There's no greater gift than friendship.

667
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:04,440
And speaking of gifts...

668
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:11,364
...let's have this young fellow
right here.

669
01:14:48,859 --> 01:14:50,444
Now...

670
01:14:50,611 --> 01:14:53,614
...what would you like for Christmas?

671
01:14:53,781 --> 01:14:55,658
Me.

672
01:14:55,825 --> 01:14:57,243
You.

673
01:15:11,757 --> 01:15:14,593
Yes. Indeed.

674
01:15:17,430 --> 01:15:19,932
Yes, indeed.

675
01:15:26,731 --> 01:15:30,526
The first gift of Christmas!

676
01:15:45,082 --> 01:15:48,836
This bell is a wonderful symbol
of the spirit of Christmas...

677
01:15:49,003 --> 01:15:51,547
...as am I.

678
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:54,884
Just remember...

679
01:15:55,051 --> 01:15:57,803
...the true spirit of Christmas...

680
01:15:57,970 --> 01:16:00,306
...lies in your heart.

681
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:13,652
Merry Christmas.

682
01:16:15,696 --> 01:16:18,532
Better keep that in a safe place.

683
01:16:38,427 --> 01:16:43,307
Hey, hey. Man alive, are you lucky.

684
01:17:05,538 --> 01:17:08,165
Pull, Comet. Pull, boy!

685
01:17:11,335 --> 01:17:13,546
Prancer, that's a girl.

686
01:17:18,175 --> 01:17:20,427
Good boy, Donder.

687
01:17:52,251 --> 01:17:56,547
Now, Dasher. Now, Prancer and Vixen.

688
01:18:05,389 --> 01:18:08,475
It's everything I dreamed it would be.

689
01:18:08,642 --> 01:18:10,436
Could all--?

690
01:18:10,603 --> 01:18:13,564
Could all this be nothing but a dream?

691
01:18:13,731 --> 01:18:15,274
No.

692
01:18:27,578 --> 01:18:29,997
<i>To the top of the roof
To the top of the wall</i>

693
01:18:30,164 --> 01:18:35,002
<i>Now, dash away, dash away
Dash away all</i>

694
01:19:07,493 --> 01:19:10,371
All aboard!

695
01:19:10,537 --> 01:19:12,456
One, two. One, two, three, go.

696
01:19:12,623 --> 01:19:16,502
<i>Rockin' on top of the world
Rockin' on top of the world</i>

<i>Rockin' on top of the world

700
01:19:25,886 --> 01:19:28,222
Come on, shorty!

701
01:19:41,277 --> 01:19:43,696
Show your tickets.
Have your tickets ready.

702
01:19:43,862 --> 01:19:46,407
Remember to eat
the five basic food groups.

703
01:19:46,573 --> 01:19:48,367
Ticket, please.

704
01:19:48,534 --> 01:19:51,829
And please brush after every meal.

705
01:19:54,957 --> 01:19:57,376
Remember to duck and cover.

706
01:19:57,543 --> 01:19:59,169
All right, you. Ticket, please.

707
01:20:07,052 --> 01:20:09,638
"Lean." Whatever that's
supposed to mean.

708
01:20:09,805 --> 01:20:12,099
"Lean" is spelled with four letters.

709
01:20:12,266 --> 01:20:14,518
I believed I punched five.

710
01:20:16,729 --> 01:20:19,565
Hey, are you saying
I don't know how to--?

711
01:20:19,732 --> 01:20:22,985
I'm sorry. It says "learn." My mistake.

712
01:20:23,152 --> 01:20:25,070
Lesson learned.

713
01:20:25,237 --> 01:20:26,613
Ticket.

714
01:20:43,422 --> 01:20:44,923
That is some special ticket.

715
01:20:45,090 --> 01:20:46,592
Sure is.

716
01:20:46,759 --> 01:20:51,055
So can you count on us
to get you home safe and sound?

717
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:54,892
Absolutely.

718
01:20:55,059 --> 01:20:56,560
Me...

719
01:20:57,811 --> 01:20:59,855
...and my friends.

720
01:21:02,608 --> 01:21:03,817
Ticket.

721
01:21:12,368 --> 01:21:15,454
It says "lead." Like "lead balloon."

722
01:21:15,621 --> 01:21:18,290
I believe it also is pronounced "lead."

723
01:21:18,457 --> 01:21:20,417
As in "leader," "leadership."

724
01:21:20,584 --> 01:21:22,795
"Lead the way."

725
01:21:22,961 --> 01:21:25,172
Follow you anywhere, ma'am.

726
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:29,343
Ah, yes.

727
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:32,471
Young man with all the questions.

728
01:21:32,971 --> 01:21:34,390
Ticket.

729
01:21:44,441 --> 01:21:46,652
It says--

730
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:48,529
It's nothing I need to know.

731
01:21:59,415 --> 01:22:01,792
- Come on, let's see the bell.
-Let's see it.

732
01:22:01,959 --> 01:22:04,670
- Come on, let's see the bell.
-Show us the bell.

733
01:22:04,837 --> 01:22:07,005
Yeah, let's see the bell.

734
01:22:14,304 --> 01:22:16,014
It's gone.

735
01:22:17,266 --> 01:22:20,102
- Where is it?
-I lost it.

736
01:22:20,269 --> 01:22:22,855
I lost the bell from Santa's sleigh.

737
01:22:23,021 --> 01:22:24,857
L'I'S gone?

738
01:22:26,191 --> 01:22:27,526
Don't worry.

739
01:22:27,693 --> 01:22:30,112
- We'll-- We'll find it.
-Yeah, we'll find it.

740
01:22:30,279 --> 01:22:32,614
Yeah, we'll help you. All of us.

741
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:35,617
Yeah, let's hurry out
and find it right now.

742
01:22:45,127 --> 01:22:46,879
It's too late.

743
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:50,883
Gee, that's really too bad.

744
01:22:51,884 --> 01:22:53,552
Really.

745
01:23:08,066 --> 01:23:09,902

748
01:23:57,699 --> 01:23:59,618
Hey, where you going?

749
01:24:00,619 --> 01:24:01,745
Home.

750
01:24:01,912 --> 01:24:05,499
Oh, okay. Merry Christmas.

751
01:24:10,546 --> 01:24:13,465
Thanks for stopping the train for me.

752
01:24:19,304 --> 01:24:20,931
Have a wonderful Christmas.

753
01:24:23,016 --> 01:24:25,519
Watch your step, please.

754
01:24:27,145 --> 01:24:29,147
And merry Christmas.

755
01:24:46,164 --> 01:24:47,457
Look.

756
01:24:50,127 --> 01:24:53,005
Santa got to Billy's house already.

757
01:24:55,799 --> 01:24:58,552
Look, look! Santa got here!

758
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:00,304
Isn't that amazing?

759
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:01,888
It is amazing.

760
01:25:09,271 --> 01:25:11,398
It is amazing.

761
01:25:57,736 --> 01:26:00,030
I'm sorry about the bell.

762
01:26:00,614 --> 01:26:03,283
It was a really special present.

763
01:26:03,450 --> 01:26:05,202
Well, you know what they say.

764
01:26:05,369 --> 01:26:07,663
It's the thought that counts.

765
01:26:08,330 --> 01:26:09,790
Yeah.

766
01:26:10,957 --> 01:26:13,835
Well, see you.

767
01:26:16,421 --> 01:26:17,964
Well...

768
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:20,217
...see you.

769
01:26:21,093 --> 01:26:22,594
See you.

Watch your step, please.

771
01:26:40,153 --> 01:26:41,405
Thank you.

772
01:26:41,571 --> 01:26:44,116
No, thank you.

773
01:26:45,867 --> 01:26:47,661
One thing about trains:

774
01:26:47,828 --> 01:26:49,913
It doesn't matter where they're going.

775
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:54,126
What matters is deciding to get on.

776
01:27:11,101 --> 01:27:12,602
Merry Christmas!

777
01:27:16,314 --> 01:27:17,524
What?

778
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:23,196
Merry Christmas!

779
01:28:31,723 --> 01:28:36,102
Wake up. Wake up.
Santa's been here. Santa's been here.

01:28:36,269 --> 01:28:37,938
Hurry up. Hurry up!

781
01:28:38,104 --> 01:28:41,441
Mom, Dad, wake up. Wake up!

782
01:28:41,608 --> 01:28:44,611
Santa's been here! Santa's been here!

783
01:28:44,778 --> 01:28:48,698
Mom, Dad, look!
He brought us all kinds of stuff!

784
01:28:48,865 --> 01:28:51,409
Look, a train!

785
01:29:07,801 --> 01:29:13,306
This is the beautiful-est,
most wonderful-est Christmas ever.

786
01:29:13,473 --> 01:29:15,767
Wait. Look.

787
01:29:17,060 --> 01:29:18,937
Here's one more.

788
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:22,357
Has your name on it.

789
01:29:51,344 --> 01:29:53,847
<i>Found this on the seat of my sleigh.</i>

790
01:29:54,014 --> 01:29:56,683
<i>Better fix that hole in your pocket.</i>

791
01:29:56,850 --> 01:29:58,101
<i>Mr. C.</i>

792
01:30:08,153 --> 01:30:11,323
Oh, what a beautiful bell.
Who's it from?

793
01:30:11,489 --> 01:30:13,533
- Santa.
-Santa?

794
01:30:13,700 --> 01:30:15,327
Really?

795
01:30:16,369 --> 01:30:18,788
- Oh, that's too bad.
-What's this?

796
01:30:19,831 --> 01:30:21,333
Broken.

797
01:30:22,459 --> 01:30:24,628
Sorry about that, sport.

798
01:30:29,174 --> 01:30:32,302
Come on, kids. We don't wanna be late.

799
01:30:40,352 --> 01:30:43,855
<i>At one time, most of my friends
could hear the bell.</i>

800
01:30:44,022 --> 01:30:48,068
<i>But as years passed,
it fell silent for all of them.</i>

801
01:30:48,234 --> 01:30:53,531
<i>Even Sarah found, one Christmas, that she
could no longer hear its sweet sound.</i>
