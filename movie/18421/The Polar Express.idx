片名：北极特快

3
00:00:47,023 --> 00:00:49,985
多年以前的某个圣诞夜
On Christmas Eve, many years ago...

4
00:00:50,152 --> 00:00:52,612
我静静的躺在床上
...I lay quietly in my bed.

5
00:00:52,779 --> 00:00:55,115
我没有翻来覆去
I did not rustle the sheets.

6
00:00:55,282 --> 00:00:58,577
也没有心浮气燥
I breathed slowly and silently.

7
00:00:58,744 --> 00:01:04,458
我仔细听着
害怕再也听不到…
I was listening for a sound
I was afraid I'd never hear.

8
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:09,921
圣诞老人雪橇上的铃声
The ringing bells of Santa 's sleigh.

9
00:02:37,926 --> 00:02:41,555
好了，好了
你喝完了水，是吗?
All right. All right, Sarah,
you had your water.

10
00:02:41,722 --> 00:02:43,765
该上楼睡觉啦
Now let's get you upstairs
and into bed.

11
00:02:43,932 --> 00:02:46,560
但…但…我得…
But-- But-- But, I hace to--

12
00:02:49,229 --> 00:02:52,023
他说圣诞老人得飞的比光速还快…
He said Santa would have to
fly faster than light...

13
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:56,027
才能在一个晚上到每户人家去
他的雪橇也得和一艘货船一样大
...to get to every house in one night.
And to hold everyone's presents...

14
00:02:56,194 --> 00:02:58,905
才能装的下每个人的礼物
...his sled would be bigger
than an ocean liner.

15
00:02:59,072 --> 00:03:03,076
你哥哥是这么说的?
他是说笑,他知道圣诞老人是怎样的
Your brother said that?. He was just
kidding you. He knows there's a Santa.

16
00:03:03,243 --> 00:03:06,913
他说他不确定
是不是真的有圣诞老人
He said he wasn't sure.
He wasn't sure if Santa was for real.

17
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,125
当然有啦,就像圣诞节也是真的呀
Of course Santa is real.
He's as real as Christmas itself.

18
00:03:10,292 --> 00:03:13,920
但是如果不好好睡觉
圣诞老人就不会来
But he won't come until you're
sound asleep, young lady.

19
00:03:14,921 --> 00:03:16,757
祝好梦
Sweet dreams.

20
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,926
圣诞老人很快就会来
Santa will be here before you know it.

21
00:03:20,093 --> 00:03:22,095
快睡吧
So go to sleep.

22
00:04:06,765 --> 00:04:08,975
史塔克 和 拜伦(作者)
""Stark, barren.

23
00:04:12,187 --> 00:04:14,689
无生命迹象
Decoid of life.""

24
00:04:25,701 --> 00:04:27,953
大概已经睡着了
He's gotta be asleep by now.

25
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,165
他以前总是不睡,要等圣诞老人
He used to stay awake all night
waiting for Santa.

26
00:04:32,582 --> 00:04:35,919
以前的日子都过去了
Think those days are just about over.

27
00:04:36,086 --> 00:04:38,004
如果真是这样,那也真伤心
That would be sad if that were true.

28
00:04:38,171 --> 00:04:41,675
对呀,童真不再
Yeah, an end of the magic.

29
00:04:43,093 --> 00:04:45,429
圣诞快乐,甜心
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

30
00:04:52,894 --> 00:04:54,646
他睡的真熟
See, he's out like a light.

31
00:04:54,813 --> 00:04:57,983
就算火车来也吵不醒
An express train
wouldn't wake him up now.

32
00:05:01,278 --> 00:05:03,697
童真不再！
""End of the magic ""?

33
00:07:15,245 --> 00:07:19,082
上车咯!
All aboard!

34
00:07:22,294 --> 00:07:26,256
上车咯!
All aboard!

35
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,620
你…要上车吗?
Well?. You coming?.

36
00:07:57,913 --> 00:07:59,122
去哪儿?
Where?.

37
00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:01,458
当然是去北极啦!
Why, to the North Pole, of course.

38
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:05,462
这是极地特快
This is the Polar Express.

39
00:08:06,421 --> 00:08:08,131
北极?
The North Pole?.

40
00:08:09,633 --> 00:08:11,259
我明白了
I see.

41
00:08:11,426 --> 00:08:12,803
请替我拿一下
Hold this, please.

42
00:08:12,969 --> 00:08:14,930
谢谢
Thank you.

43
00:08:15,597 --> 00:08:17,557
这是你吗?
Is this you?.

44
00:08:19,351 --> 00:08:21,186
- 是的
- 这上说…
-Yeah.
-Well, it says here...

45
00:08:21,353 --> 00:08:26,024
今年没去商场和圣诞老人拍照
也没写信给他
...no photo with a department-store
Santa this year, no letter to Santa.

46
00:08:26,191 --> 00:08:29,861
还叫你妹妹也不要写…
And you made your sister
put out the milk and cookies.

47
00:08:30,445 --> 00:08:32,698
看来今年是你的关键年
Sounds to me like
this is your crucial year.

48
00:08:32,864 --> 00:08:37,244
如果我是你,就会立刻上车
If I were you, I would think
about climbing onboard.

49
00:08:40,038 --> 00:08:44,501
快,快,快,我赶时间…哇!
Come on, come on.
I've got a schedule to keep.

50
00:08:47,212 --> 00:08:49,548
随你吧
Suit yourself.

51
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:53,570
在极地特快上
事情就是这样子的
'Cause that's the way things happen
On the Polar Express

52
00:09:53,737 --> 00:09:56,740
呜~呜~汽笛响
是她唱歌的声音
Whoo, whoo, the whistle blows
That's the sound of her singing

53
00:09:56,907 --> 00:10:00,160
叮~叮~铃声响
天哪，看着她走
Ding, ding, the bell will ring
Golly, loo at her go

54
00:10:00,327 --> 00:10:03,747
你觉得如果我们很快到达
谁来猜一猜…
You wonder if we'll get there soon
Anybody's guess

55
00:10:03,914 --> 00:10:07,167
在极地特快上
事情就是这样子的
'Cause that's the way things happen
On the Polar Express

56
00:10:07,334 --> 00:10:10,921
当我们到那里
就会尖叫，“噢，耶”
When we get there
We'll scream, ""Yay!""

57
00:10:11,088 --> 00:10:13,340
我们到达那里
附和着邦~邦~邦
We'll arrive with
A bang, bang, bang

58
00:10:13,507 --> 00:10:15,759
还有噗~噗~噗
路上一直说笑着
Boom, boom, boom
Laughing all the way

59
00:10:15,926 --> 00:10:19,096
有个舒服的位子和很多吃的
天哪，这真是最好的
With a comfy seat and lots to eat
Boy, it's just the best

60
00:10:19,262 --> 00:10:22,474
希望永远不要结束
Wish it would 't ever have to end

61
00:10:22,641 --> 00:10:25,435
加上一点运气，我们会准时到的
没有必要有压力
With a little luck, we'll be on time
There's no need to stress

62
00:10:25,602 --> 00:10:30,107
在极地特快上
事情就是这样子的
'Cause that's the way things happen
On the Polar Express

63
00:10:32,901 --> 00:10:36,613
嗨,嗨,叫你呢
这是哪一种火车,你知道吗?
Hey. Hey, you. Yeah, you.
Do you know what kind of train this is?.

64
00:10:38,407 --> 00:10:41,284
火车，这是哪一种火车,你知道吗?
Train. Do you know what kind of train
this is?. Do you?.

65
00:10:43,578 --> 00:10:44,788
当然
Of course.

66

这是魔法火车
It's a magic train.

67
00:10:47,457 --> 00:10:50,585
- 我们要去北极
- 我当然知道是魔法火车!
-We're going to the North Pole.
-I know it's a magic train.

68
00:10:50,752 --> 00:10:53,338
这是鲍温284S3系列,蒸气动力火车
It's a Baldwin 2-8-4 S3-class
steam locomotive...

69
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:58,427

Wow, look at all those presents.

That is a public-address microphone.
It is not a toy.

我们正驶往铁路的另一端
We're heading for the other side
of the tracks.

89
00:12:55,127 --> 00:12:57,003
你…要来吗?
Well?. You coming?.

90
00:12:57,504 --> 00:12:58,922
只是停下来载人
It's just another pickup.

91
00:12:59,089 --> 00:13:02,551
奇怪! 我已为你是最后一位乘客
That's weird. I thought you were
supposed to be the last one.

92
00:13:02,718 --> 00:13:04,928
当然是去北极啦!
Why, to the North Pole, of course.

93

- 去拉紧急刹车
-I don't know how.
-Pull the emergency brake!

100
00:14:32,641 --> 00:14:35,519
是谁拉了紧急刹车?
Who in the blazes applied
that emergency brake?.!

101
00:14:35,685 --> 00:14:37,104
是他!
He did.

102
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:39,022
你!
You.

103
00:14:39,523 --> 00:14:44,361
如果你到现在还不知道
那是紧急时刻专用的刹车
In case you didn't know, that cord
is for emergency purposes only.

104
00:14:44,861 --> 00:14:49,282
你没有注意今晚是圣诞夜吧
And in case you weren't aware,
tonight is Christmas Eve.

105
00:14:49,449 --> 00:14:53,537
还有你难道没注意,我们正在赶时间
And in case you hadn't noticed,
this train is on a very tight schedule.

106
00:14:53,704 --> 00:14:57,666
小伙子,圣诞节对你来说或许不重要…
Now, young man, Christmas
may not be important to some people...

107
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:01,294
但是对我们来说很重要
...but it is very important
to the rest of us!

108
00:15:01,461 --> 00:15:02,963
但是…但是…
But-- But--

109
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:06,717
他只是想停住车,好让那个男孩儿上车
He was just trying to stop the train
so that kid could get on.

110
00:15:09,094 --> 00:15:12,389
我明白了
小伙子,是这样吗?
I see. Young man,
is that what happened?.

111
00:15:16,893 --> 00:15:18,854
好吧
Well....

112
00:15:19,146 --> 00:15:22,816
让我提醒你,现在时间很紧
Let me remind you we are
on a very tight schedule.

113
00:15:22,983 --> 00:15:25,235
以前从没迟到过…

114
00:15:25,402 --> 00:15:28,155
今晚也绝对不能
...and I am certainly not
going to be late tonight.

大家注意…
Your attention, please.

118
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:47,424
车上的人,有谁需要用点心?
Are there any Polar Express passengers
in need of refreshment?.

119
00:15:47,591 --> 00:15:50,552
- 我! 我! 我!

# 决不让食物凉了 #
Never, ever let it cool

129
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:19,998
# 一直在锅里热着 #
Keep it cooking in the pot

# 就有了热巧克力 #

00:29:28,161 --> 00:29:31,039
只有一英寸宽
...and the roof of Flat Top Tunnel.

266
00:29:31,206 --> 00:29:33,083
明白吗?
Savvy?.

267
00:29:36,211 --> 00:29:39,256
车要上坡了,孩子
It's just the run up to the hump, kid.

268
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:41,758
好玩的来了
This will be interesting.

269
00:30:04,948 --> 00:30:06,658
快上来,快呀
Get back on, kid. Hurry!

270
00:30:06,825 --> 00:30:09,119
抓住我的滑雪棍
Grab my muck stick.

271
00:30:44,821 --> 00:30:47,324
只有一个窍门
There's only one trick to this, kid.

272
00:30:48,492 --> 00:30:49,993
我说“跳”
When I say ""jump""...

273
00:30:52,412 --> 00:30:56,333
你就跳！
...you jump!

274
00:31:19,147 --> 00:31:22,317
我还以为你被扔下火车了
You. I thought you got thrown off, and--

275
00:31:22,693 --> 00:31:25,529
- 你在这儿开火车!
- 机师让我开
-You're driving the train?.
-They put me in charge.

276
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:29,116
- 他们要去检查车灯了
- 灯泡在这儿，小心
-The engineer had to check the light.
-Here's the light. Careful.

277
00:31:29,282 --> 00:31:30,951
现在好了
All right, now.

278
00:31:33,078 --> 00:31:34,579
我拿到了
I got it.

279
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:40,794
- 你怎么会开?
- 很简单,来,我告诉你
-How do you know how?.
-It's easy. Come here, I'll show you.

280
00:31:40,961 --> 00:31:43,422
那个大扳手是加速器
This big lecer here, that's the throttle.

281
00:31:43,588 --> 00:31:45,716
这个小的是刹车
This little one here, that's the brake.

282
00:31:45,882 --> 00:31:48,760
那些是压力表
And those are the pressure gauges.

283
00:31:48,927 --> 00:31:51,513
那跟绳子是鸣笛
And that rope is the whistle.

284
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,890
鸣笛
The whistle.

285
00:31:54,683 --> 00:31:56,601
想试试吗?
You wanna try it?.

286
00:31:59,438 --> 00:32:02,441
我一直梦想要拉一下
I'ce wanted to do that my whole life.

287
00:32:05,986 --> 00:32:09,156
别动…别动
Hold still! Hold still! Don't moce!

288
00:32:10,323 --> 00:32:11,366
快看!
Look!

289
00:32:23,587 --> 00:32:27,049
快停车!快停车!
Stop the train! Stop the train!

290
00:32:28,091 --> 00:32:29,926
快停车!
Stop the train!

291
00:32:32,888 --> 00:32:34,598
什么?
What?.

292
00:32:34,765 --> 00:32:37,434
他们要我们停车
They want us to stop the train.

293
00:32:37,601 --> 00:32:40,062
- 哪个是刹车?
- 他说是这个
-Which one is the brake?.
-He told me this was.

294
00:32:40,228 --> 00:32:41,938
- 谁说?
- 机师!
-Who?.
-The engineer.

295
00:32:42,147 --> 00:32:46,735
- 机师?这个看起来像是刹车
- 不是,不是,他说这是刹车
-The engineer?. This one looks like a brake.
-No, he said this was the brake.

296
00:32:46,902 --> 00:32:47,944
你确定?
Are you sure?.

297
00:32:49,446 --> 00:32:50,739
你确定?
Are you sure?.

298
00:32:57,829 --> 00:33:00,540
拉刹车
Pull the brake!

299
00:33:00,749 --> 00:33:02,626
停车
Stop the train!

300
00:33:19,976 --> 00:33:21,937
哈罗,鹿兄
Caribou?.

301
00:33:24,481 --> 00:33:28,360
极地特快到不了北极
圣诞节也泡汤了
There can be no Christmas without
the Polar Express arriving on time.

302
00:33:28,527 --> 00:33:31,822
难道只有我懂?
Am I the only one who understands that?.

303
00:33:31,988 --> 00:33:34,783
我早该猜到
You. I should hace known.

304
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:38,829
你是不是一心
想让车子到不了北极
Are you bound and determined that
this train never reaches the North Pole?.

305
00:33:38,995 --> 00:33:40,580
看!
But look.

306
00:33:41,915 --> 00:33:43,417
驯鹿过街!
Caribou crossing?.!

307
00:33:44,334 --> 00:33:48,088
我猜最少十万,或许百万
I make that herd to be at least
1 00,000, maybe even a million.

308
00:33:48,255 --> 00:33:51,341
要它们全部让路得要几个小时
It's gonna be hours
before they clear this track.

309
00:33:51,508 --> 00:33:55,554
- 麻烦的事情
- 我们这下麻烦大了
-A tough nut to crack.
-We are in some serious jelly.

310
00:33:55,721 --> 00:33:58,181
- 非常拥挤
- 紧要关头
-And a jam.
-Tight spot.

311
00:33:58,348 --> 00:33:59,683
- 小溪上去
- 树上去
-Up a creek.
-Up a tree.

312
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:03,061
- 在草地里迷失
- 我告诉你什么草地，我们…
-Lost in the grass.
-I'll tell you what's grass: our a--

313
00:34:45,479 --> 00:34:49,900
问题解决了
慢…速…前进
Problem solced. All ahead, slow.

314
00:35:35,779 --> 00:35:37,698
我们驶的很快耶
We're going pretty fast.

315
00:35:37,864 --> 00:35:40,742
去告诉机师们放慢速度
Tell the engineer to slow down.

316
00:35:46,081 --> 00:35:47,708
慢一点
Slow it down.

317
00:35:49,584 --> 00:35:52,337
小心速度太快
Watch the speed!

318
00:35:57,384 --> 00:36:00,429
跳开了,快把它抓住
Jumping jeepers,
the cotter pin sheared off.

319
00:36:00,595 --> 00:36:01,888
- 什么东西?
- 栓子!
-What?.
-The pin.

320
00:36:02,055 --> 00:36:04,224
- 哪里?
- 那里!
-Where?.
-There.

321
00:36:04,391 --> 00:36:05,934
- 不妙!
- 不妙!
-Oh, no.
-Oh, no.

322
00:36:06,977 --> 00:36:09,896
- 他们听不到我
- 听不到?
-They can't hear me.
-They can't?.

323
00:36:13,233 --> 00:36:15,736
不喜欢这个景象
在安全栏下面
I don't like the look of this.
Under the safety bar.

324
00:36:17,904 --> 00:36:20,198
不会有事儿吧?
我们该怎么办?
Is everything all right?.
What should we do?.

325
00:36:21,954 --> 00:36:24,548
照…目前的状况来看
我们无法连络机师…
Considering we've lost communication
with the engineer...

326
00:36:24,661 --> 00:36:27,914
我们在车头前,完全暴露在外
...we are standing totally exposed
on the front of the locomotive...

327
00:36:28,081 --> 00:36:31,251
车一直在加速，无法控制
...the train appears to be
accelerating uncontrollably...

328
00:36:31,418 --> 00:36:35,255
我们快速冲向前方的冰峡谷
...and we are rapidly
approaching Glacier Gulch...

329
00:36:35,422 --> 00:36:38,925
这是世上最陡峭的峡谷
...which happens to be the steepest
downhill grade in the world...

330
00:36:39,092 --> 00:36:42,387
我建议我们都得…
...I suggest we all hold on...

331
00:36:42,929 --> 00:36:45,182
抓～紧～栏～!
...tightly.

332
00:37:05,369 --> 00:37:07,204
- 栓子
- 栓子
-The pin.
-The pin.

333
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:30,602
糟糕…车轨已经被冰覆盖
Jiminy Christmas, the ice has frozen
over the tracks.

334
00:37:52,999 --> 00:37:55,168
不…不…抓紧…抓紧!
Hold on. Hold on. No, no.

335
00:37:56,086 --> 00:37:58,213
快!小心脚下…快…
Come on. Watch your step.

336
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:01,591
抓紧…快上来…快
Come on, sweetie.
Up you go. Up you go.

337
00:38:04,052 --> 00:38:06,513
脚放在这里，这里
Put your feet on here. On here.

338
00:38:09,057 --> 00:38:10,350
有点刺激，是吗?
Little adcenture, huh?.

339
00:38:10,517 --> 00:38:12,936
小伙子…反应满快的
Young man, quick thinking on your part.

340
00:38:34,041 --> 00:38:36,793
到左边去
Step to your left, please. To your left.

341
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:44,134
呵…这才像话
Well, that is more like it.

342
00:38:46,511 --> 00:38:49,222
你们搞啥?
What in the name of Mike?.

343
00:38:52,351 --> 00:38:53,810
看!
Look.

344
00:38:56,438 --> 00:38:59,191
快带我们火速离开
Get us the blazes out of here!

345
00:39:07,449 --> 00:39:09,034
让车滑开
Turn this sled around.

346
00:39:27,511 --> 00:39:28,929
看那里
Look there.

347
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,974
车轨
Tracks.

348
00:39:33,141 --> 00:39:34,559
正前方
Dead ahead.

349
00:39:40,399 --> 00:39:41,525
右
Right.

350
00:39:47,322 --> 00:39:48,365
左
Left.

351
00:39:53,829 --> 00:39:54,871
右
Right.

352
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:00,001
打直
Hang a Louie.

353
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:04,506
拉掣阀
Toss a Ritchie.

354
00:40:07,884 --> 00:40:09,553
拉手
Port astern.

355
00:40:11,722 --> 00:40:13,557
放慢
To the starboard.

356
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:17,436
- 我的拖鞋
- 你的车票要掉了
-My slipper.
-You're gonna lose your ticket.

357
00:40:17,602 --> 00:40:19,479
不是我的,是你的
It's not my ticket, it's yours.

358
00:40:19,646 --> 00:40:21,481
- 我的?
- 对!
-It's my ticket?.
-Yes.

359
00:40:21,648 --> 00:40:23,775
右…跟着我…左…
Right. Keep up with me. Left.

360
00:40:24,109 --> 00:40:26,528
右…左…
Right. Left.

361
00:40:30,574 --> 00:40:31,908
右…
Right.

362
00:40:32,242 --> 00:40:33,535
左…
Left.

363
00:40:33,702 --> 00:40:35,078
右…
Right.

364
00:40:35,245 --> 00:40:37,205
左…右
Left. Right.

365
00:40:40,917 --> 00:40:42,210
- 噢，糟糕！
- 噢，糟糕！
-Oh, no!
-Oh, no!

366
00:40:44,421 --> 00:40:46,256
抓紧了
Brace yourselces!

367
00:40:57,225 --> 00:40:59,144
呵…这才像话
Well, that's more like it.

368
00:41:01,521 --> 00:41:03,065
谢谢你
Thank you.

369
00:41:03,231 --> 00:41:06,526
谢谢你
真不敢相信,你帮我找到车票
Thank you. I can't believe
you found my ticket.

370
00:41:07,069 --> 00:41:09,696
谁说…找到…车票了?
Did someone say they found a ticket?.

371
00:41:11,698 --> 00:41:15,118
这么说…车票拿来吧
Well, in that case.... Tickets, please.

372
00:41:24,002 --> 00:41:25,545
谢谢
Thank you.

373
00:41:27,255 --> 00:41:31,176
-“L-E”?
- 和那个万事通的一样
-""L-E""?.
-Just like that know-it-all kid.

374
00:41:46,191 --> 00:41:48,777
走路小心
Watch your step.
Tricky walking up here.

375
00:41:48,944 --> 00:41:51,321
提醒你,上坡时,路很滑
It's mighty slick.
Mighty slick, I tell you.

376
00:41:52,489 --> 00:41:55,033
我刚说啥来着!?
There you go. What did I tell you?.

377
00:41:55,200 --> 00:42:00,330
很久以前
我首次圣诞夜之旅
我在车顶巡视…
Years ago, on my first Christmas Ece run,
I was up on the roof making my rounds...

378
00:42:00,497 --> 00:42:02,416
也踩到冰滑了一下
...when I slipped on the ice myself.

379
00:42:02,582 --> 00:42:06,002
我伸手去抓栏杆
但栏杆断了,就滑倒了
I reached out for a hand iron,
but it broke off. I slid and fell.

380
00:42:06,169 --> 00:42:10,173
但是没有掉下车去
And yet, I did not fall off this train.

381
00:42:10,757 --> 00:42:13,009
某人救了你?
Someone saved you?.

382
00:42:13,176 --> 00:42:15,178
也可能是某“物”
Or something.

383
00:42:18,056 --> 00:42:19,349
天使
An angel.

384
00:42:20,267 --> 00:42:21,935
或许
Maybe.

385
00:42:22,102 --> 00:42:24,187
等等…
Wait. Wait.

386
00:42:25,022 --> 00:42:28,191
他长的什么样子?
你看到他了吗?
What did he look like?. Did you see him?.

387
00:42:29,317 --> 00:42:33,196
没有,有时…眼见为实
No, sir. But sometimes
seeing is believing.

388
00:42:33,572 --> 00:42:38,702
有时…最真实的我们却看不见
And sometimes the most real things
in the world are the things we can't see.

389
00:42:44,541 --> 00:42:46,877
这些被遗弃的
The forsaken and the abandoned.

390
00:42:48,045 --> 00:42:52,049
小心走
这些可怜的玩具受了不少罪…
Mind your step, now.
These poor toys hace suffered enough...

391
00:42:52,215 --> 00:42:56,553
被世人到处抛弃,自生自灭
...being left to rust and decay in the
back alleys and cacant lots of the world.

392
00:42:57,054 --> 00:42:58,847
它们怎么会在这儿?
-What are they doing here?.
-It's a new concept the boss came up with.

393
00:42:59,014 --> 00:43:01,224
这是领导的新点子

394
00:43:01,391 --> 00:43:04,770
与其丢弃它们
不如收集起来修补一下
Instead of being thrown away,
they're collected. Refurbished.

395
00:43:05,479 --> 00:43:10,567
他说这是循环
反覆,再生什么的
He calls it ""rebicycling.""
Something like that.

396
00:43:12,819 --> 00:43:15,238
真令人伤心
Makes me wanna cry...

397
00:43:15,405 --> 00:43:18,575
看到它们这样被虐待
...seeing toys that were
treated this way.

398
00:43:19,368 --> 00:43:23,580
这些吊绳都打结的木偶问题才大
These hopelessly entangled
string puppets and marionettes...

399
00:43:23,747 --> 00:43:28,043
我们在北极处理这些玩具的人员…
...pose a particular problem. We found
the nimble fingers of our work force...

400
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:32,547
为了打开绳结,可费尽脑筋了…
...here at the North Pole are best
for working out those knots and tangles.

401
00:43:32,714 --> 00:43:35,258
谢谢你，这里双保险
Thank you. Double-locked here.

402
00:43:46,645 --> 00:43:50,107
朋友,你就像我一样…
You are just like me, my friend.

403
00:43:50,273 --> 00:43:52,651
一个捣蛋鬼
A scrooge!

404
00:43:52,818 --> 00:43:54,986
埃比尼泽捣蛋鬼
Ebenezer Scrooge.

405
00:43:55,153 --> 00:43:58,490
捣蛋鬼从来不信什么…
North Pole, Santa Claus, this train...

406
00:43:58,657 --> 00:44:02,577
圣诞节,北极,圣诞老人…等等
全是难以置信,骗人的玩意儿
...it's all a bunch of humbug.
A bout of indigestion.

407
00:44:02,744 --> 00:44:05,330
喔,我是到你是啥…
Oh, yeah. I know what you are.

408
00:44:05,497 --> 00:44:08,125
你是个“怀疑论”者
You're a doubter.

409
00:44:08,291 --> 00:44:10,836
你怀疑,你不相信…
A doubter. You don't believe!

410
00:44:11,002 --> 00:44:14,172
你是怀疑论者! 你不相信
You're a doubter! You don't beliece!

411
00:44:31,273 --> 00:44:34,192
你错过好戏啦
我们爬过陡坡
You missed it.
We rode down some really sharp hills.

412
00:44:34,359 --> 00:44:36,403
然后经过似乎结冰的湖面
We were on what looked like a frozen lake.
But I know it was just an optical illusion.

413
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:38,739
但是我说是视觉假像

414
00:44:38,905 --> 00:44:41,825
他说车子是走在冰上
我说这不可能…
He said the train was on ice.
I said it's impossible--

415
00:44:41,992 --> 00:44:44,661
因为车轨不可能…
你去哪里?
You can't put a train track--
Where you going now?.

416
00:44:59,217 --> 00:45:02,179
# 我对星星许愿 #
I'm wishing on a star

417
00:45:02,345 --> 00:45:05,515
# 试着去相信 #
And trying to believe

418
00:45:05,682 --> 00:45:08,852
# 虽然很遥远 #

419
00:45:09,311 --> 00:45:11,855
# 但确有圣诞夜 #
He'll find me Christmas Eve

420
00:45:12,481 --> 00:45:15,609
# 我猜圣诞老人很忙 #
I guess that Santa 's busy

421
00:45:15,776 --> 00:45:18,779
# 因为他从未来过 #
'Cause he's never come around

422
00:45:19,279 --> 00:45:25,035
# 圣诞节来临时,我就会想到他 #
I think of him
When Christmas comes to town

423
00:45:25,827 --> 00:45:28,997
# 那是一年中最好的时光 #
The best time of the year

424
00:45:29,164 --> 00:45:32,376
# 所有的人都回家了 #
When everyone comes home

425
00:45:32,542 --> 00:45:35,712
# 在圣诞节的气氛下 #
With all this Christmas cheer

426
00:45:35,879 --> 00:45:39,424
# 是不该独自渡过的 #
It's hard to be alone

427
00:45:39,591 --> 00:45:45,639
# 朋友们都聚在一起竖起了圣诞树 #
Putting up the Christmas tree
With friends who come around

428
00:45:45,806 --> 00:45:52,187
# 圣诞节来时,真是有趣 #
It's so much fun
When Christmas comes to town

429
00:45:52,979 --> 00:45:59,069
# 孩子们的礼物包五颜六色 #
Presents for the children
Wrapped in red and green

430
00:45:59,611 --> 00:46:05,409
# 这些我都听过,却没见过 #
All the things I've heard about
But never really seen

431
00:46:06,243 --> 00:46:08,745
# 圣诞夜没人会睡觉 #
No one will be sleeping

432
00:46:08,912 --> 00:46:11,998
# 圣诞夜的晚上 #
On the night of Christmas Eve

433
00:46:12,165 --> 00:46:19,256
# 翘首盼望圣诞老人降临 #
Hoping Santa 's on his way

434
00:46:19,423 --> 00:46:22,509
# 当他雪橇上的铃声响起 #
When Santa 's sleighbells ring

435
00:46:22,676 --> 00:46:25,554
# 我仔细听 #
I listen all around

436
00:46:25,721 --> 00:46:28,932
# 当天使唱起圣歌 #
The herald angels sing

437
00:46:29,099 --> 00:46:32,102
# 我却从来都听不见 #
I never hear a sound

438
00:46:32,644 --> 00:46:36,106
# 孩子们的其他梦想 #
And all the dreams of children

439
00:46:36,273 --> 00:46:39,067
# 曾逝去的会再寻回 #
Once lost will all be found

440
00:46:39,234 --> 00:46:45,157
# 当圣诞来时，这就是我所有的祈望 #
That's all I want
When Christmas comes to town

441
00:46:47,534 --> 00:46:56,209
# 当圣诞来时
这就是我所有的祈望 #
That's all I want
When Christmas comes to town

442
00:47:07,721 --> 00:47:09,181
看呀
Look.

443
00:47:11,850 --> 00:47:13,852
北极光
The northern lights.

444
00:47:16,688 --> 00:47:18,732
喂,你们叁个
Hey. You three.

445
00:47:19,941 --> 00:47:21,735
我们刚经过…
We just crossed it.

446
00:47:21,902 --> 00:47:27,324
北纬66度33分…北极圈
Latitude 6622'.
The Arctic Circle.

447
00:47:27,491 --> 00:47:30,827
你们看到远方的极光吗?
And do you see?.
Those lights in the distance.

448
00:47:31,745 --> 00:47:36,208
看起来像大货船航行在
结冰的海上所发出奇异的光芒
They look like the lights of a strange
ocean liner sailing on a frozen sea.

449
00:47:37,501 --> 00:47:39,503
那…
There...

450
00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:42,214
就是北极
...is the North Pole.

451
00:47:47,219 --> 00:47:50,055
地上有魔毯
从来没有休息过
It's a magic carpet on a rail
It never takes a rest

452
00:47:50,222 --> 00:47:53,392
飞过高山和白雪
flying through
The mountains and the snow

453
00:47:53,558 --> 00:47:56,520
只要你愿意
就可以免费加入，享受快乐
You can ride for free and join the fun
If you just say yes

454
00:47:56,687 --> 00:48:00,023
在极地特快上
事情就是这样子的
'Cause that's the way things happen
On the Polar Express

455
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:03,318
呜~呜~汽笛响
是她唱歌的声音
Whoo, whoo, the whistle blows
That's the sound of her singing

456
00:48:03,485 --> 00:48:06,697
叮~叮~铃声响
天哪，看着她走
Ding, ding, the bell will ring
Golly, look at her go

457
00:48:06,863 --> 00:48:09,866
你觉得如果我们很快到达
谁来猜一猜…
You wonder if you'll get there soon
Anybody's guess

458
00:48:10,033 --> 00:48:13,245
在极地特快上
事情就是这样子的
'Cause that's the way things happen
On the Polar Express

459
00:48:13,412 --> 00:48:16,540
当我们到那里
就会尖叫，“噢，耶”
When we get there
We'll scream, ""Yay!""

460
00:48:16,707 --> 00:48:19,042
我们到达那里
附和着邦~邦~邦
We'll arrive with
A bang, bang, bang

461
00:48:19,209 --> 00:48:22,212
还有噗~噗~噗
路上一直说笑着
Boom, boom, boom
Laughing all the way

462
00:48:27,217 --> 00:48:30,137
到了! 比预定时间
还早5分钟!
We made it. With fice minutes to spare.

464
00:48:57,622 --> 00:48:59,916
精灵呢? 他们在哪儿?
There should be elces.
Where are the elces?.

465
00:49:00,083 --> 00:49:01,752
对呀,精灵在哪儿?
Yeah, where are the elces?.

466
00:49:01,918 --> 00:49:04,254
他们都聚集在市中心
They are gathering
in the center of the city.

467
00:49:04,421 --> 00:49:08,216
圣诞老人就在那儿
给出圣诞节的第一个礼物
That is where Santa will give
the first gift of Christmas.

468
00:49:09,092 --> 00:49:11,553
谁会拿到圣诞节的第一个礼物?
Who gets the first gift of Christmas?.

469
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:15,599
他会在你们之中…选一个
He will choose one of you.

470
00:49:18,643 --> 00:49:21,605
- 看!
- 精灵!

471
00:49:52,469 --> 00:49:54,805
听好咯…听好咯…先生女士们
All right. All right,
ladies and gentlemen.

472
00:49:54,971 --> 00:49:57,683
请大家排成两队
Two columns, if you please.

473
00:49:57,849 --> 00:50:00,644
矮的排前面,高的排后面
Shorter in the front, taller in the rear.

474
00:50:01,144 --> 00:50:04,773
偶数生日在右边,奇数生日在左边
Even-numbered birthdays on the right,
odd-numbered on the left.

475
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:07,859
不可以推人,不要到处闲逛
No pushing. No pushing.
But let's not dilly-dally.

476
00:50:08,026 --> 00:50:09,945
还有5分钟才到午夜
It's fice minutes to midnight.

477
00:50:10,112 --> 00:50:13,699
怎么算的呀!
4分钟前也是剩5分钟!
Hey, what gives?. It was five minutes
till midnight four minutes ago.

478
00:50:14,157 --> 00:50:16,660
没错! 排成两排…
Exactly. Columns of two.

479
00:50:16,827 --> 00:50:18,954
- 一排…两排
- 对不起
-One, two.
-Excuse me.

480
00:50:19,121 --> 00:50:21,581
- 有问题吗?
- 他怎么办?
-Question.
-What about him?.

481
00:50:24,334 --> 00:50:27,045
没人会被强迫去见圣诞老人
No one is required to see Santa.

482
00:50:28,171 --> 00:50:31,383
先生女士们,你们不需要牵手
Ladies and gentlemen,
you do not hace to hold hands...

483
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:35,011

-Look, you have to come with us.
-She's right.

486
00:50:52,612 --> 00:50:57,075
我从来信不圣诞节
Christmas just doesn't work out
for me. Never has.

487
00:50:57,242 --> 00:50:59,870
但是圣诞节是多么美好的时光
But Christmas is such a wonderful,
beautiful time.

和朋友家人享受施与受的感恩
It's a time for giving and being thankful,
for friends and family.

圣诞老人也会把礼物留在树下
People hang decorations and lights. Santa
leaces presents under our Christmas trees.

490
00:51:10,547 --> 00:51:12,299
只是我…
Christmas just...

491
00:51:12,883 --> 00:51:14,760
从来信不圣诞节
...doesn't work out for me.

492
00:51:16,553 --> 00:51:20,265
听着…我不管你信不信圣诞节
Look, I don't know if Christmas
is gonna work out for you or not...

493
00:51:20,432 --> 00:51:23,560
今晚是圣诞夜,不要独自一人
...but this is Christmas Eve.
Don't stay here by yourself.

494
00:51:25,228 --> 00:51:26,772
对,跟我们走
Yes, come with us.

495
00:51:27,314 --> 00:51:29,107
我们一起去
We'll go together.

496
00:51:41,203 --> 00:51:42,829
不好
Oh, no.

497
00:51:50,879 --> 00:51:52,756
我们会平安无事
We're gonna be okay.

498
00:51:55,092 --> 00:51:57,219
或许不会!
Maybe not!

499
00:51:59,096 --> 00:52:01,056
紧急刹车!
The emergency brake.

500
00:52:01,223 --> 00:52:03,183
紧急刹车!
The emergency brake.

501
00:52:06,895 --> 00:52:10,691
没有刹车…我找不到刹车
There's no brake. I can't find the brake!

502
00:52:17,197 --> 00:52:19,783
休息会儿吧,孩子
Take a break, kid.

503
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:23,620
热巧克力咖啡怎么样?
How about a nice, good hot cup of Joe?.

504
00:52:52,232 --> 00:52:53,316
快要撞上了！
We're gonna crash!

505
00:53:00,323 --> 00:53:02,242
我们在转圈圈
We're spinning.

506
00:53:28,018 --> 00:53:29,978
嘘…你们听到了吗?
You hear that?.

507
00:53:30,562 --> 00:53:31,855
铃声
The bell.

508
00:53:33,231 --> 00:53:35,609
- 什么铃声?
- 雪橇上的铃声
-What bell?.
-The sleighbell.

509
00:53:35,776 --> 00:53:38,195
- 雪橇上的铃声?
- 听到了吗?
-Sleighbell?.
-Don't you hear it?.

510
00:53:39,529 --> 00:53:42,074
从隧道那边来的
It's coming from that tunnel.

511
00:53:47,621 --> 00:53:49,748
我们该朝那边去
That's the way we should go.

512
00:53:58,215 --> 00:53:59,758
快呀
Come on.

513
00:54:31,957 --> 00:54:33,542
怎么啦?
What?.

514
00:54:34,042 --> 00:54:36,712
- 怎么啦?
- 快点
-What?.
-Come on.

515
00:54:48,682 --> 00:54:49,725
快点
Come on.

516
00:54:59,526 --> 00:55:01,319
我们迷路了
We're lost.

517
00:55:11,288 --> 00:55:12,706
是的
Yes.

518
00:55:13,957 --> 00:55:16,877
- 是…我听到了
- 我也听到了
-Yes. I hear it.
-I hear it too.

519
00:55:17,044 --> 00:55:21,131
- 我什么也没听到
- 是那边来的声音
-I don't hear anything.
-Okay, it's down this way.

520
00:55:21,298 --> 00:55:22,507
你确定?
Are you sure?.

521
00:55:27,095 --> 00:55:28,430
非常确定
Absolutely.

522
00:55:34,061 --> 00:55:36,563
为什么我什么也听不到?
Why can't I hear anything?.

523
00:55:39,149 --> 00:55:41,777
下去…安静
Get down and be quiet.

524
00:55:50,911 --> 00:55:52,245
嗯…嗯…
Yeah.

525
00:55:55,248 --> 00:55:56,792
好的
Okay.

526
00:55:57,709 --> 00:55:59,836
报告,这里是礼物包装中心
Well, that was the wrapping hall, chief.

527
00:56:00,003 --> 00:56:02,589
- 最后一个我也包好了
- 怎么包的?
-Just finished the last one.
-How's it wrapped?.

528
00:56:02,756 --> 00:56:06,676
是用红色丝带和7号绿色花结
It's wrapped in candy-striped red
with a number-seven holly-green bow.

529
00:56:06,843 --> 00:56:10,138
7号花结!?
我们也成了有钱人?
A number-seven bow?.
When we're this close to liftoff?.

530
00:56:10,305 --> 00:56:13,767
他们在下面想什么?
是不是发疯了?
What are they thinking down there?.
Are they meshuggener?.

531
00:56:13,934 --> 00:56:16,186
- 路线是什么?
- 去美国
-What's the routing?.
-Going to the States.

532
00:56:16,353 --> 00:56:18,563
密西根州格兰拉比市
Grand Rapids, Michigan.

533
00:56:19,106 --> 00:56:22,109
是我家的城市
我从格兰拉比来的
That's my town. I'm from Grand Rapids.

534
00:56:27,406 --> 00:56:30,450
我们有麻烦了
还真是时候!
We got a troublemaker now.
Just what we need.

535
00:56:30,617 --> 00:56:33,537
事情还不至於最坏
他是不是20岁了?
Things aren't bad enough.
What's his 20?.

536
00:56:33,704 --> 00:56:36,998
显然是新泽西州枫树市来的一个孩子…
Apparently, some kid
from Maplewood, New Jersey...

537
00:56:37,165 --> 00:56:39,584
把泡泡糖粘到妹妹头上
...stuck some gum in his sister's hair.

538
00:56:40,168 --> 00:56:45,549
新泽西?是上次那个…
在老师身上贴了
一个标签的同一个男孩?
New Jersey?. Is that the same kid
that put the tack...

539
00:56:44,165 --> 00:56:49,000
-...underneath his teacher's chair last year?.
-No, sir. This kid's name is Stecen.

540
00:56:45,716 --> 00:56:49,344
- 不是,长官,这孩子叫斯帝芬
- 斯帝芬

541
00:56:49,845 --> 00:56:52,806
我们现在怎么办，首领?
通知圣诞老人?
So, what do we do, chief?.
Alert the big man?.

542
00:56:52,973 --> 00:56:55,976
圣诞夜不给他礼物?
We talking nothing for Christmas here?.

543
00:57:03,234 --> 00:57:04,599
I didn 't do it.

544
00:57:05,543 --> 00:57:07,295
我不做
I didn 't do it.

545
00:57:07,462 --> 00:57:09,213
我不做
I didn 't do it.

546
00:57:11,549 --> 00:57:14,010
听我说,圣诞节…
马上就到了,对吧?
Look, it's....
It's almost Christmas, huh?.

547
00:57:14,636 --> 00:57:16,512
原谅他一次
We'll cut the kid a break.

548
00:57:16,679 --> 00:57:18,723
但是,把他列入名单,明年复查两次
But put him on the check-twice list
for next year.

549
00:57:19,515 --> 00:57:21,643
好了，孩子们
All right, boys.

550
00:57:21,851 --> 00:57:24,937
现在关店
今年到这儿为止,走吧
Let's shut it down.
That's it for this year. Come on.

551
00:57:25,104 --> 00:57:29,651
- 首领,我们要乘子弹梭车吗?
- 当然要乘子弹梭车!
-Hey, boss, are we taking the pneumatic?.
-Of course we're taking the pneumatic.

552
00:57:29,817 --> 00:57:32,987
这是唯一能赶到广场的方法
It's the only way to get
to the square on time.

553
00:57:33,154 --> 00:57:36,407
- 咱们走
- 时间就是金钱
-Let's go.
-And time is money.

554
00:57:37,033 --> 00:57:39,786
准备…上车
Ready, and mount.

555
00:57:41,204 --> 00:57:43,873
好了，关门吧
Good. Close.

556
00:57:58,429 --> 00:58:00,264
上车吧
All right, get in.

557
00:58:01,724 --> 00:58:03,851
我不知道这个
I don't know about this.

558
00:58:38,256 --> 00:58:41,092
我没有听到,你呢?
I don't hear it. Do you?.

559
00:58:42,427 --> 00:58:44,053
也没听到
No.

560
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:48,182
我觉得该顺着箭头走
I think we should follow those arrows.

561
00:59:02,447 --> 00:59:04,907
我以为这儿会有出路
I thought there'd be a way out.

562
00:59:05,074 --> 00:59:07,285
我们恐怕会错过一切
We're gonna miss ecerything.

563
00:59:17,295 --> 00:59:18,921
喂～看呀
Hey, look.

564
00:59:20,381 --> 00:59:21,924
一个礼物
A present.

565
00:59:26,262 --> 00:59:29,265
要去我的城市
给一个叫比利的人
It's going to my town.
To someone named Billy.

566
00:59:29,432 --> 00:59:35,021
- 我叫比利
- 去艾布克街11344号
-My name is Billy.
-It's going to 1 1 344 Edbrooke Avenue.

567
00:59:35,188 --> 00:59:37,065
是我的地址
That's my address.

568
00:59:44,864 --> 00:59:46,449
快点
Come on.

569
01:00:46,509 --> 01:00:47,969
看呀
Look.

570
01:00:49,345 --> 01:00:52,807
上面说“比利,圣诞快乐…圣先生赠”
It says, ""Merry Christmas, Billy.
From Mr. C.""

571
01:00:53,808 --> 01:00:58,187
我想我知道是什么
是我这辈子最想要的
I think I know what it is.
I wanted one of these my whole life.

572
01:00:59,147 --> 01:01:01,482
等等…停…看
Wait, wait. Stop. Look.

573
01:01:03,568 --> 01:01:05,695
不过我…
But l....

574
01:01:05,862 --> 01:01:07,697
这是规矩
Those are the rules.

575
01:03:08,610 --> 01:03:10,278
有东西在拽我
Something's got me.

576
01:03:10,445 --> 01:03:12,155
抓住我的脚了
It's got my leg.

577
01:03:12,697 --> 01:03:14,073
我抓不住你
I can't hold him.

578
01:03:14,616 --> 01:03:17,535
另外一只手给我
另外一只手给我
Give me your other hand.
Give me your other hand.

579
01:03:17,910 --> 01:03:20,246
- 我不能
- 我数到叁
-I can't.
-On three.

580
01:03:20,413 --> 01:03:23,541
一,二,叁
One, two, three.

581
01:03:24,292 --> 01:03:26,294
- 看…
- 我还是被抓住了
-Look.
-It's still got me.

582
01:03:26,461 --> 01:03:29,797
我再数叁
一,二,叁
On three again. One, two, three.

583
01:03:33,134 --> 01:03:34,636
- 你!
- 你!
-You.
-You.

584
01:03:34,802 --> 01:03:36,846
- 你在这儿干嘛?
- 和你一样
-What are you doing here?.
-Same as you.

585
01:03:37,013 --> 01:03:40,600
我在检查我的礼物
确定我清单上的都有
Checking my presents. Making sure
I'm getting everything on my list.

586
01:03:40,767 --> 01:03:43,686
我只有一个像样的礼物
其他的全是内衣裤
I found one present.
All it had was stupid underwear.

587
01:03:43,853 --> 01:03:45,480
看
Look.

588
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:56,240
我们随时开始下降
You may start your descent
any time now.

589
01:03:56,407 --> 01:03:58,660
当然了，也要看你的方便
At your convenience, of course.

590
01:04:10,838 --> 01:04:14,258
还有五分钟
我们能赶得上
It's still fice to.
I think we're gonna make it.

591
01:04:14,425 --> 01:04:17,053
当然! 一个钟头前,就还有五分钟
Of course. It's been five to
for the last hour.

592
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:20,807
我们时间多了,我们什么都没有
就是有时间,我们还有时间来消磨
We got plenty of time. We got nothing
but time. We got time to kill.

593
01:04:20,974 --> 01:04:24,727
你知道吗?
我们可能无法平安降落
You know what?.
I don't think we're gonna make it.

594
01:04:27,146 --> 01:04:30,275
虽然我只是个火车长…
I may be just an old railroader...

595
01:04:30,441 --> 01:04:33,236
我不知道怎么飞热气球…
...and know nothing about
lighter-than-air craft...

596
01:04:33,403 --> 01:04:38,908
但是就我这外行来判断
你们需要再高一点才行
...but from my layman's perspective,
you need more altitude!

597
01:04:39,075 --> 01:04:41,536
再高一点!
More altitude!

598
01:04:42,245 --> 01:04:45,206
高度…我们需要多一点高度
Altitude, please. A bit more altitude, please.

599
01:04:46,207 --> 01:04:48,376
跳啊!
Geronimo!

600
01:05:03,725 --> 01:05:05,268
飞精灵
The Flying Elves.

601
01:05:05,435 --> 01:05:08,229
他们是专家
你们可不能在家模仿
They are specialists.
Do not try that at home, kids.

602
01:05:08,396 --> 01:05:10,356
孩子们,你们可不能在家模仿哦
Do not try that at home.

603
01:05:10,523 --> 01:05:11,774
我们恐怕过不去
We're not gonna make it.

604
01:05:52,023 --> 01:05:53,650
维修良好的机器
A well-oiled machine.

605
01:06:03,451 --> 01:06:06,287
好啦,你们这些偷渡客
All right, you stowaways.

606
01:06:06,704 --> 01:06:09,874
- 派对结束啦
- 我们只是跟着他们
-Party's over.
-I was just following them.

607
01:06:10,041 --> 01:06:11,960
我们是不小心闯进来的
We fell in here by mistake.

608
01:06:12,126 --> 01:06:15,838
少来,我们知道你们一直都在里面
Forget about it. We knew you
was in there the whole time.

609
01:06:17,757 --> 01:06:19,133
快,出来吧
Come on, out you go.

610
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:23,012
走,爬上来,爬上来
Let's go, come on.
Step up, step up. There we go.

611
01:06:23,179 --> 01:06:26,432
行啦…没问题…
慢走…好的很…
Not a problem. Come on.
Watch your step. There you go.

612
01:06:32,313 --> 01:06:35,650
为了确定你们的安全
我告诉你们怎么下去
So nobody gets hurt, here's
how we're gonna get you guys down.

613
01:06:35,817 --> 01:06:39,153
- 简单的很,我知道
- 你知道啥!?
-This is simple. Why, I know--
-What do you know?.

614
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:42,991
你们根本就不该在这儿
You're not supposed to be here
in the first place.

615
01:06:43,366 --> 01:06:47,620
但既然是圣诞节
我就让你溜过去
But since it's Christmas,
I'm gonna let you slide.

616
01:06:47,787 --> 01:06:48,830
嗨
Hey.

617
01:06:51,374 --> 01:06:52,709
我一直在找你
Been looking for you.

618
01:06:55,837 --> 01:06:57,213
该你了
There you go.

619
01:06:57,380 --> 01:06:58,631
小心点儿
Watch your step.

620
01:06:58,798 --> 01:07:00,717
小心
Careful.

621
01:07:00,883 --> 01:07:02,969
漂亮
Beautiful form. Beautiful.

622
01:07:03,136 --> 01:07:05,513
很高兴又见到你
Nice to see you again.

623
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:10,143
这次很惊险吧?
Cutting it kind of close, aren't we?.

624
01:07:10,310 --> 01:07:13,896
这个给我保管吧?
I'll take care of this.

625
01:07:14,063 --> 01:07:16,190
我会好好保管
It's in good hands.

626
01:07:16,357 --> 01:07:19,027
相信我
Trust me.

627
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:51,059
# 这个季节的灵魂 #
It's the spirit of the season

628
01:07:51,225 --> 01:07:54,771
# 你可以在空气中感觉到 #
You can feel it in the air

629
01:07:54,937 --> 01:07:58,691
# 如果注意听就能听到 #
You can hear it if you listen

630
01:07:58,858 --> 01:08:02,528
# 任何地方都有关爱 #
Everywhere
So much care

631
01:08:02,695 --> 01:08:04,405
# 就像祈祷者 #
Like a prayer

632
01:08:04,572 --> 01:08:08,242
# 不管是什么，都可以分享 #
Whatever it is
You need to share it

633
01:08:08,409 --> 01:08:13,581
# 这个季节的灵魂 #
It's the spirit of the season

634
01:08:23,091 --> 01:08:28,096
# 这个季节的灵魂 #
It's the spirit of the season

635
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:36,980
# 你可以在空气中感觉到 #
You can feel it in the air

636
01:08:50,368 --> 01:08:53,496
这铃声是最动听的声音?
Aren't those bells
the most beautiful sound?.

637
01:10:09,697 --> 01:10:11,240
圣诞老人就要进城了
He's here! He's here!

638
01:10:11,407 --> 01:10:12,659
在哪里?
Where?.

639
01:10:12,825 --> 01:10:15,203
我看到了，他在那里
I see him. He's ocer there.

640
01:10:15,370 --> 01:10:16,871
我看不到
I can't see him.

641
01:10:37,058 --> 01:10:39,060
我看不到
I can't see him.

642
01:10:39,227 --> 01:10:42,021
我看不到
I can't see him!

643
01:11:44,626 --> 01:11:48,129
怀疑者，怀疑者
Doubter. Doubter.

644
01:11:51,716 --> 01:11:53,176
好吧
Okay.

645
01:11:54,260 --> 01:11:56,179
好吧

谢谢
Thank you.

654
01:13:02,453 --> 01:13:05,707

-Me, me. Pick me, Santa.
-What are you doing?. Stop it.

655
01:13:05,873 --> 01:13:08,960

- 别这样
-Pick me, pick me. I want the first gift.

小伙子…
Young man...

657
01:13:11,254 --> 01:13:13,089
耐心点儿
...patience.

658
01:13:13,256 --> 01:13:17,927
还有,谦虚一点对你会比较好
And a smidgen of humility
might also serve you well.

659

很有自信和热诚
Full of confidence and spirit.

663

01:30:29,334 --> 01:30:32,462
孩子们快吧,我们不想迟到
Come on, kids. We don't wanna be late.

805
01:30:40,511 --> 01:30:44,015
曾几何时,我大部分的朋友
都能听到铃声
At one time, most of my friends
could hear the bell.

806
01:30:44,182 --> 01:30:48,227
但是大家过去的这些年头
都已悄悄逝去
But as years passed,
it fell silent for all of them.

807
01:30:48,394 --> 01:30:53,691
甚至某年莎拉也突然
再也听不见甜美的铃声
Even Sarah found, one Christmas, that she
could no longer hear its sweet sound.

808
01:30:53,858 --> 01:30:55,526
现在我长大了…
Though I've grown old...

809
01:30:55,693 --> 01:30:58,071
还是能听到铃声
... the bell still rings for me.

810
01:30:58,237 --> 01:31:02,325
就像所有相信圣诞节的人一样
As it does for all who truly believe.

811
01:31:05,828 --> 01:31:08,957
谢谢观赏
