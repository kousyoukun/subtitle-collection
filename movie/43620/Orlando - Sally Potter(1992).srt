1
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,356
A see the virgin rose.

2
00:00:12,557 --> 00:00:16,048
How sweetly she doth first peep forth with bashful modesty.

3
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:17,871
That fair her seems...

4
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:21,343
That fair her seems the less ye see her may.

5
00:00:22,215 --> 00:00:25,400
Lo see soon after how...

6
00:00:32,871 --> 00:00:34,617
Modesty.

7
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:36,295
There are things that she'll see!

8
00:00:36,717 --> 00:00:41,206
Lo see soon after how... more bold and free her bared bosom...

9
00:00:49,617 --> 00:00:53,070
A see the virgin rose... How sweetly she doth peep forth with bashful modesty.

10
00:00:53,118 --> 00:00:55,976
<i>There can be no doubt about his sex.</i>

11
00:00:56,216 --> 00:01:01,098
<i>Despite the feminine appearance that every young man at the time aspires to.</i>

12
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,416
<i>And there can be no doubt about his upbringing.</i>

13
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:05,836
<i>Good food.</i>

14
00:01:05,836 --> 00:01:07,111
<i>Education.</i>

15
00:01:07,111 --> 00:01:08,080
<i>A nanny.</i>

16
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,583
<i>Loneliness and isolation.</i>

17
00:01:11,686 --> 00:01:14,382
<i>And...because this is England...</i>

18
00:01:14,669 --> 00:01:18,918
<i>Orlando would therefore seem destined to have his portrait on the wall.</i>

19
00:01:19,177 --> 00:01:22,131
<i>And his name in the history books.</i>

20
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,232
<i>But when he...</i>

21
00:01:24,682 --> 00:01:25,824
That is...

22
00:01:25,824 --> 00:01:27,234
I

23
00:01:27,234 --> 00:01:29,392
<i>Came into the world.</i>

24
00:01:29,699 --> 00:01:31,962
<i>He was looking for something else.</i>

25
00:01:32,979 --> 00:01:37,189
<i>Though heir to a name that meant power, land and property...</i>

26
00:01:37,707 --> 00:01:40,230
<i>Surely when Orlando was born...</i>

27
00:01:40,374 --> 00:01:42,714
<i>it wasn't privilege he sought...</i>

28
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:45,102
<i>but company.</i>

29
00:02:27,927 --> 00:02:30,363
<i>♫ Eliza ♫</i>

30
00:02:30,555 --> 00:02:34,755
<i>♫ Eliza's eyes are blessed stars, ♫</i>

56
00:05:49,494 --> 00:05:53,235
DEATH

57
00:05:54,367 --> 00:05:56,352
More wine my lord?

58
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,677
A see the virgin rose.

59
00:06:27,677 --> 00:06:30,458
How sweetly she doth first peep forth

60
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,549
With bashful modesty.

61
00:06:33,019 --> 00:06:36,117
That fair her seems the less ye see her may.

62
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:38,927
Lo see soon after how..

63
00:06:38,927 --> 00:06:43,723
more bold and free her bared bosom she doth broad display

64
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:47,434
Lo see soon after how she fades...

65
00:06:48,067 --> 00:06:49,602
and falls away.

66
00:06:49,602 --> 00:06:51,520
so passeth in th..

67
00:06:51,942 --> 00:06:54,110
Is this a worthy topic?

68
00:06:54,187 --> 00:06:58,608
From one so clearly in the bloom of youth.

69
00:06:58,694 --> 00:07:01,773
To one who would desire it still?

70
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:06,070
Fair virgo gratious majesty,

71
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:09,561
Your bloom is legendary,

72
00:07:09,561 --> 00:07:13,283
and these were of course not the sentiments of our son,

73
00:07:13,283 --> 00:07:15,201
but of a poet.

74
00:07:15,383 --> 00:07:18,232
Now what would please you?

75
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:22,615
All that is mine is here for your pleasure.

76
00:07:22,663 --> 00:07:26,950
All you call yours is mine already.

77
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,607
Come.

78
00:08:03,809 --> 00:08:05,228
Your leg.

79
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:22,406
I want you here in England with me.

80
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:25,936
You will be the son of my old age

81
00:08:25,936 --> 00:08:29,024
and the limb of my infirmity.

82
00:08:29,283 --> 00:08:31,268
My favorite.

83
00:08:31,431 --> 00:08:33,378
My mascot.

84
00:08:43,017 --> 00:08:44,197
Come.

85
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,638
Aah, this is my victory.

86
00:10:12,292 --> 00:10:15,601
Come, your handsome leg.

87
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:33,047
For you and for your heirs Orlando.

88
00:10:33,393 --> 00:10:34,860
The house.

89
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,373
Your Majesty.

90
00:10:38,246 --> 00:10:39,751
I'm forever i...

91
00:10:39,751 --> 00:10:42,111
But on one condition.

92
00:10:42,773 --> 00:10:44,854
Do not fade.

93
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:47,981
Do not wither.

94
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:52,009
Do not grow old.

95
00:11:12,218 --> 00:11:14,443
Very interesting person.

96
00:11:58,859 --> 00:12:02,159
First the queen and now his father.

97
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:04,288
It is too sad.

98
00:12:04,451 --> 00:12:06,599
Mourning so becomes him.

99
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:09,304
One can quite see why he was the favorite.

100
00:12:09,304 --> 00:12:11,328
My dear friends how can you?

101
00:12:11,385 --> 00:12:13,582
In his time of grief.

102
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:52,752
LOVE

103
00:13:12,414 --> 00:13:14,131
That way.

104
00:13:44,487 --> 00:13:45,772
Sasha!

105
00:14:05,568 --> 00:14:06,988
Who's that?

106
00:14:07,362 --> 00:14:09,894
I believe she is the daughter of the muscovite ambassador.

107
00:14:11,332 --> 00:14:12,934
How the delightful.

108
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:15,869
If that's to your taste.

109
00:14:16,579 --> 00:14:18,209
What ever can you mean?

110
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:21,557
Oh, smearing themselves with candle wax to keep warm.

111
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,539
Wearing beards as they get older, that kind of thing.

112
00:14:24,846 --> 00:14:27,062
Perhaps in this you're mistaken, Moray.

113
00:14:27,062 --> 00:14:29,364
Told me on good authority by Lord Francis Vere.

114
00:14:29,412 --> 00:14:30,726
Does he travel to muscovite.

115
00:14:30,726 --> 00:14:32,404
He knows someone who did.

116
00:14:32,692 --> 00:14:33,737
Aah.

117
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:10,097
This is the Lady Euphrosyne.

118
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:12,265
The Lord Winchelsea.

119
00:15:13,569 --> 00:15:15,497
The Lord Orlando.

120
00:15:16,466 --> 00:15:17,674
The Earl of Moray.

121
00:15:17,674 --> 00:15:19,593
Moray....

122
00:15:20,283 --> 00:15:22,758
And I am Lord Lord Francis Vere.

123
00:15:22,854 --> 00:15:24,417
Ochin Liesna.

124
00:15:24,522 --> 00:15:26,335
- Sorry?
- Enchanté.

125
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,622
- Enchanted.
- Aah.

126
00:15:31,409 --> 00:15:34,286
And my name is Alexandra Menchikova.

127
00:15:34,382 --> 00:15:36,722
But my father calls me Sasha.

128
00:15:38,161 --> 00:15:39,552
Enchanté.

129
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:41,921
Here doing some quail.

130
00:15:41,921 --> 00:15:43,283
Spasiba.

131
00:15:43,436 --> 00:15:45,345
Do they have quail in Russia?

132
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:47,560
Do you speak French?

133
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:49,172
A little.

134
00:15:50,495 --> 00:15:55,617
But the most Englishmen can't, or do not want to speak other languages.

135
00:15:56,116 --> 00:15:59,137
How do they communicate with strangers then?

136
00:16:00,067 --> 00:16:01,880
They speak english louder.

137
00:16:02,427 --> 00:16:04,786
Please tell the ambassador that this,

138
00:16:04,786 --> 00:16:09,515
great frost is the most severe ever to have visited these islands.

139
00:16:10,157 --> 00:16:16,727
Erh, tell him that in Norfolk a young country woman was seen to turn visibly to powder

140
00:16:16,794 --> 00:16:21,331
and was blown away in a puff of dust in the icy blast.

141
00:16:22,395 --> 00:16:23,901
Most amusing.

142
00:17:21,371 --> 00:17:27,078
Don't worry my dear, this absurd affection will not last the season.

143
00:17:27,184 --> 00:17:28,805
After all..

144
00:17:28,901 --> 00:17:30,723
She's a foreigner.

145
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:20,012
My Lord Orlando, you're in danger of becoming a fool.

146
00:18:20,453 --> 00:18:23,906
You're ruining what could be the finest career in the land and for what?

147
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:26,620
I no longer care for a career, Moray.

148
00:18:26,783 --> 00:18:28,749
I'm only interested in love.

149
00:18:29,363 --> 00:18:34,447
Don't you see in courting a Cossack, you're humiliating not only your fiancé

150
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:37,401
but the entire female population of this country.

151
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:40,556
Besides which, they have nothing.

152
00:18:41,055 --> 00:18:42,944
Why do you think they're here?

153
00:19:23,074 --> 00:19:26,565
For your sake I would hunt wolf instead of rabbit drinking vodka instead of whiskey.

154
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:27,601
How generous.

155
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:31,648
As for marriage to the good Lady Euphrosyne the thing is so probably absurd that I scarcely give it a thought.

156
00:19:31,648 --> 00:19:32,684
How gallant.

157
00:19:32,684 --> 00:19:37,499
I feel as if I've been hooked through the nose and rushed through the waters painfully yet with my own consent.

158
00:19:38,141 --> 00:19:39,417
How brave.

159
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:48,107
My Lord, have you quite forgotten that we are betrothed?

160
00:19:48,212 --> 00:19:50,706
My Lady, I'm being constantly reminded.

161
00:19:50,783 --> 00:19:52,768
You speak so lightly of it.

162
00:19:53,161 --> 00:19:55,453
You've betrayed me.

163
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:57,947
The treachery of men.

164
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,781
It would never have worked.

165
00:20:07,634 --> 00:20:09,303
A man must follow his heart.

166
00:20:56,683 --> 00:20:58,314
There.

167
00:20:59,177 --> 00:21:00,414
Where you live?

168
00:21:00,414 --> 00:21:02,016
I do.

169
00:21:02,611 --> 00:21:04,423
By yourself?

170
00:21:05,709 --> 00:21:07,339
Well, yes.

171
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:10,025
At the moment.

172
00:21:15,856 --> 00:21:17,208
No brother?

173
00:21:17,439 --> 00:21:19,616
No sister?

174
00:21:22,167 --> 00:21:24,363
You Sasha?

175
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:28,171
If I had brother I wouldn't be here.

176
00:21:28,555 --> 00:21:30,799
My father only has me.

177
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:15,101
Nothing thicker than a knifes blade separates melancholy from happiness.

178
00:22:15,283 --> 00:22:17,642
Why are you sad?

179
00:22:19,043 --> 00:22:20,759
Because.

180
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,418
Because I can't bear this happiness to end.

181
00:22:26,725 --> 00:22:28,864
But we are together.

182
00:22:29,574 --> 00:22:31,396
Yes, now.

183
00:22:31,617 --> 00:22:33,381
But what about tomorrow?

184
00:22:33,496 --> 00:22:35,300
And the day after?

185
00:22:36,757 --> 00:22:38,244
Orlando.

186
00:22:38,484 --> 00:22:40,747
I think you suffer from a strange melancholy.

187
00:22:40,824 --> 00:22:43,375
Which is, you suffer in advance.

188
00:22:44,632 --> 00:22:47,020
Look at me. Look.

189
00:22:52,122 --> 00:22:54,386
You are too serious, Orlando.

190
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,858
And yet not serious enough.

191
00:23:58,321 --> 00:24:01,582
- Shadows, you saw shadows.
- You were in his arms!

192
00:24:01,582 --> 00:24:04,421
- It was illusion in light.
- Then what were you doing?

193
00:24:04,421 --> 00:24:07,586
- He was taking me across deck.
- But I saw you!

194
00:24:07,586 --> 00:24:12,046
May gods destroy me, if I family Menchikov would lie in arm of sailor.

195
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:16,045
Sasha.

196
00:24:16,323 --> 00:24:19,354
I can not think of a life without you.

197
00:24:19,728 --> 00:24:21,272
Stay with me.

198
00:24:21,378 --> 00:24:24,294
- Don't ever go.
- But it's impossible.

199
00:24:24,946 --> 00:24:26,346
But why?

200
00:24:26,346 --> 00:24:28,427
Because when ice breaks we must go.

201
00:24:28,427 --> 00:24:30,672
But we're linked.

202
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:33,722
Our destinies are linked.

203
00:24:35,304 --> 00:24:36,925
You're mine!

204
00:24:37,002 --> 00:24:38,210
Why?

205
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:41,634
Because I adore you.

206
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:45,106
Meet me at midnight at London bridge.

207
00:24:45,404 --> 00:24:48,406
We'll fly away as free as birds.

208
00:24:48,502 --> 00:24:51,695
Lot's of air, very fresh.

209
00:24:52,846 --> 00:24:54,266
There.

210
00:24:54,765 --> 00:24:57,297
It's decided.

211
00:25:01,852 --> 00:25:06,178
your lessons, speak now his now his a lot with peace within

212
00:25:06,178 --> 00:25:08,096
Speak of me as I am.

213
00:25:08,796 --> 00:25:13,381
Nothing extenuates nor sits down aught in malice.

214
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,689
Then speak of one.

215
00:25:20,689 --> 00:25:23,279
Who loved lord wisely but to well

216
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:26,617
But one whom not easily jealous

217
00:25:26,617 --> 00:25:29,475
But being wrought, perplexed in the extreme

218
00:25:29,897 --> 00:25:33,350
Of one whose hand, like the base indian

219
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:35,469
threw a pearl away.

220
00:25:35,565 --> 00:25:38,692
worth more than all his tribe.

221
00:25:42,989 --> 00:25:45,751
I kissed thee ear. I killed thee.

222
00:25:45,847 --> 00:25:47,909
No way but this.

223
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,403
By killing myself...

224
00:25:50,623 --> 00:25:53,769
To die upon a kiss.

225
00:25:57,596 --> 00:25:59,438
Terrific play.

226
00:26:38,579 --> 00:26:41,437
She will. She will be here.

227
00:27:40,538 --> 00:27:41,910
Help! Help!

228
00:28:12,544 --> 00:28:14,769
The treachery of women.

229
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,348
Ehm, ehm.

230
00:28:33,289 --> 00:28:34,172
Ehm!

231
00:28:52,453 --> 00:28:53,987
Good morning!

232
00:28:56,634 --> 00:28:59,521
It's now time to awake!

233
00:29:00,413 --> 00:29:03,588
To such a fine morning.

234
00:29:06,446 --> 00:29:09,909
From such a long refreshing sleep.

235
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:17,639
- Six days you say?
- Tomorrow will be the seventh.

236
00:29:23,125 --> 00:29:31,220
<i>♫ This pleasing shining wondrous day. ♫</i>

237
00:29:46,249 --> 00:29:47,928
The Lord Orlando...

238
00:29:47,928 --> 00:29:49,846
is sleeping.

239
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:02,727
I can find only three words to describe the female sex.

240
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:09,575
None of which are worth expressing.

241
00:30:13,795 --> 00:30:16,001
POETRY

242
00:30:16,001 --> 00:30:20,317
When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes.

243
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:25,046
I all alone beweep my outcast state.

244
00:30:26,465 --> 00:30:28,422
and trouble heaven

245
00:30:28,518 --> 00:30:31,098
with my bootless cries.

246
00:30:32,651 --> 00:30:34,809
and look upon myself

247
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:37,735
and curse my fate.

248
00:30:44,794 --> 00:30:45,858
Aah.

249
00:30:47,134 --> 00:30:48,275
Poetry.

250
00:31:09,702 --> 00:31:10,700
Get off!

251
00:31:11,668 --> 00:31:12,618
Get off!

252
00:31:12,618 --> 00:31:14,191
Off! Off!

253
00:31:31,819 --> 00:31:33,517
Thank you.

254
00:31:37,325 --> 00:31:39,713
I was thinking.

255
00:31:40,988 --> 00:31:43,895
Sitting here, as we are.

256
00:31:46,024 --> 00:31:49,755
It's odd. Considering how common the name of Greene is,

257
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:52,421
that the Greene family came over with the conquerer.

258
00:31:52,421 --> 00:31:54,339
And is in fact,

259
00:31:55,183 --> 00:31:57,763
from the highest nobility in France.
- Oh.

260
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,885
Oh, really?

261
00:32:03,336 --> 00:32:06,769
Unfortunately the Greens came down in the world and erm..

262
00:32:07,354 --> 00:32:10,472
We've little more than leave our name to the burrower of Greenwich.

263
00:32:12,025 --> 00:32:16,188
And now Mr. Greene to the subject closer to my heart and yours.

264
00:32:16,188 --> 00:32:18,336
The sacred subject of poetry.

265
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:19,267
Aah.

266
00:32:20,725 --> 00:32:26,086
You know, I once broke a lady's fan in my enthusiasm to find a rime.

267
00:32:26,585 --> 00:32:28,637
Enthusiasm can be dangerous.

268
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:33,289
As a youth I was often mocked for my love of poetry and solitude.

269
00:32:33,538 --> 00:32:35,207
Tragic.

270
00:32:35,898 --> 00:32:41,422
And of course Mr. Greene, your works hold pride of place in my library.

271
00:32:41,422 --> 00:32:42,324
Uh-uh.

272
00:32:42,372 --> 00:32:46,928
To me there is a certain glory about a man who can express in words

273
00:32:46,928 --> 00:32:50,879
those great emotions that others can only feel.

274
00:32:52,481 --> 00:32:53,382
Oh.

275
00:32:53,517 --> 00:32:57,603
You know I scarcely dared to ask to make your acquaintance

276
00:32:57,603 --> 00:33:00,796
for I feel that I can offer nothing in return.

277
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:04,997
I'm sure that any writer would be more than willing to except your hospitality.

278
00:33:05,093 --> 00:33:06,724
Oh, do you think so?

279
00:33:07,127 --> 00:33:09,256
If we would speak of poetry...

280
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:12,641
then let us first speak of poets lives.

281
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,406
Do you know how "Hamlet" was written?

282
00:33:14,483 --> 00:33:17,005
Written while bailiffs were pounding on Shakespeare's door.

283
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,005
No wonder so many of his plays were falsey too.

284
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,923
Aw, I'm sure you're right.

285
00:33:23,479 --> 00:33:26,875
How can a...How can a genius work when he cannot pay the bills?

286
00:33:27,757 --> 00:33:29,388
When I say work...

287
00:33:29,522 --> 00:33:32,246
Erm, work you see... is...

288
00:33:33,665 --> 00:33:36,284
people who haven't labored in this way don't understand

289
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,257
that real poetry neither easy nor easily produced.

290
00:33:39,401 --> 00:33:42,221
Then I feel that I can understand a little Mr. Greene.

291
00:33:42,221 --> 00:33:46,652
Because I have myself been so righteous to attempt to write some poems...

292
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:50,814
Did I hear a mouse's squeak?

293
00:33:52,109 --> 00:33:53,490
I must say I didn't hear any.

294
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,639
That's saying you're in good health.

295
00:33:55,687 --> 00:34:00,108
My own my lord have been so bad it's a marvel I'm still alive.

296
00:34:00,568 --> 00:34:04,491
I have an enlarged heart, a spleen and a diseased liver.

297
00:34:06,362 --> 00:34:10,256
Above all there are sensations in my spine which defy description.

298
00:34:10,332 --> 00:34:13,929
There is one nob about a third from the top which burns like fire.

299
00:34:14,092 --> 00:34:17,497
Second from the bottom...cold as ice.

300
00:34:17,545 --> 00:34:21,957
Sometimes I feel as if a thousand wax tapers were a lite.

301
00:34:22,024 --> 00:34:25,966
And people were throwing fireworks inside my brain and I...

302
00:34:26,043 --> 00:34:27,884
I'm so sensitive.

303
00:34:28,057 --> 00:34:31,222
I can feel a rose leaf through my mattress.

304
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:33,457
In short.

305
00:34:34,176 --> 00:34:36,698
I'm a piece of machinery so finely made

306
00:34:36,698 --> 00:34:39,317
and curiously put together

307
00:34:39,509 --> 00:34:41,475
that it confounds me to think

308
00:34:41,571 --> 00:34:44,774
That I've only sold 115 copies of my poem.

309
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:49,013
But it has to be said this is largely due to what can only be descried as a conspiracy against me.

310
00:34:49,196 --> 00:34:53,636
But Mr. Greene surely your work is widely admired by all the young poets?

311
00:34:53,713 --> 00:34:58,039
- Including dare I say it...
- All young writers will turn at any trash that will sell.

312
00:34:58,864 --> 00:35:00,427
It hurts me to say it.

313
00:35:00,475 --> 00:35:03,678
For I love literature, as I love life.

314
00:35:04,465 --> 00:35:07,409
But the art of poetry is dead in England.

315
00:35:09,001 --> 00:35:11,246
You think so?

316
00:35:11,332 --> 00:35:13,164
Of course... erhm...

317
00:35:13,797 --> 00:35:15,571
That I have pension...

318
00:35:15,638 --> 00:35:17,269
of...

319
00:35:17,451 --> 00:35:19,187
300 pounds a year?

320
00:35:19,628 --> 00:35:21,019
paid...

321
00:35:21,144 --> 00:35:22,813
quarterly...

322
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,731
I'd live for literature alone..

323
00:35:24,904 --> 00:35:27,215
I'd dedicate myself to fine writing.

324
00:35:28,443 --> 00:35:31,013
But...sadly...

325
00:35:31,013 --> 00:35:34,255
It's necessary to have a pension to do it.

326
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:36,998
About 300 pounds a year.

327
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:40,844
Paid quarterly.

328
00:35:41,631 --> 00:35:45,994
Mr. Greene, I wounder would you be so kind as to give me your opinion of my efforts?

329
00:35:45,994 --> 00:35:49,255
By all means... If I can find the time.

330
00:35:49,687 --> 00:35:51,452
For time is money.

331
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:53,581
And I must write to eat.

332
00:35:53,965 --> 00:35:58,281
- We're not in the pursuit of art.
- Of course I will arrange for the small matter of the 300 pounds.

333
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:01,053
To be paid...

334
00:36:01,053 --> 00:36:01,993
Quarterly?

335
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:04,899
- As you wish.
- My dear friend!

336
00:36:06,721 --> 00:36:09,435
"Death of a lover".

337
00:36:18,691 --> 00:36:23,333
Listen to this my friend. This is the great work

338
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:29,088
Of my gracious host, the soon to be, congratulate me friend, my pension

339
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:31,313
"His heart was broken"

340
00:36:31,457 --> 00:36:33,413
"cleft in two"

341
00:36:33,672 --> 00:36:36,348
"abandoned, lost"

342
00:36:36,482 --> 00:36:38,266
"what could he do?"

343
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:41,901
"And into this he retched cried"

344
00:36:42,016 --> 00:36:43,820
"She said she loved me"

345
00:36:44,146 --> 00:36:45,738
"But she lied"

346
00:36:45,824 --> 00:36:48,721
"And so betrayed"

347
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:51,703
"He fell and died".

348
00:37:04,373 --> 00:37:06,570
Try as he might.

349
00:37:06,714 --> 00:37:10,339
This gracious noble lord.

350
00:37:10,752 --> 00:37:12,948
Who lifts his pen.

351
00:37:13,082 --> 00:37:15,211
And thinks he then can write.

352
00:37:15,307 --> 00:37:19,489
Can not, for who can pen.

353
00:37:19,767 --> 00:37:22,088
When he is bored.

354
00:37:22,165 --> 00:37:27,881
The mind of leisure only can be trite.

355
00:37:28,466 --> 00:37:32,552
This pretty knight who feebly lifts his sword

356
00:37:32,619 --> 00:37:36,187
To make a witless thrust against his doom.

357
00:37:36,312 --> 00:37:39,400
Is foiled by what his noble birth affords

358
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:43,515
Dogs, dogs more dogs and far to many rooms.

359
00:37:43,937 --> 00:37:48,080
So fortune smiles on those that own the land

360
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:52,550
And frowns at the trivia from the dabblers hand.

361
00:38:00,347 --> 00:38:04,145
I would like you to drop this in the midst of the filthiest manure.

362
00:38:04,222 --> 00:38:06,275
And Mr. Greene's pension, sir?

363
00:38:07,071 --> 00:38:09,181
Pay it, quarterly.

364
00:38:20,729 --> 00:38:21,870
Abroad?

365
00:38:21,956 --> 00:38:23,903
As your ambassador, your majesty.

366
00:38:24,009 --> 00:38:25,572
Ambassador?

367
00:38:25,716 --> 00:38:29,898
I see, once the balance of power has been established here in Europe.

368
00:38:30,138 --> 00:38:33,984
We must certainly turn our attention to the east.

369
00:38:34,252 --> 00:38:35,902
Well Orlando.

370
00:38:37,245 --> 00:38:43,699
I fear you will be quite starved of conversation and amusement in such a remote corner of the world.

371
00:38:44,361 --> 00:38:49,224
However, I believe they have an interest in...

372
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:51,142
horticulture.

373
00:38:51,468 --> 00:38:57,204
I'd like you to bring them some tulips.

374
00:39:01,865 --> 00:39:05,970
POLITICS

375
00:40:32,377 --> 00:40:37,153
My dear sir, please accept my hospitality.

376
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:41,239
Feel that my home is your home.

377
00:40:41,575 --> 00:40:45,488
And call upon me as you would a brother, for any of your needs.

378
00:40:45,488 --> 00:40:47,761
You really are to kind.

379
00:40:49,842 --> 00:40:53,554
And I must say I'm most impressed by your command of the english language.

380
00:40:53,554 --> 00:40:56,201
I hadn't expect... I mean...

381
00:40:56,403 --> 00:40:58,119
I wasn't led to believe...

382
00:40:59,558 --> 00:41:01,889
Why...are you here?

383
00:41:02,148 --> 00:41:05,342
I'm here as a representative of his majesty's government.

384
00:41:05,409 --> 00:41:07,260
Yes?

385
00:41:08,487 --> 00:41:13,158
It has been said to me that the English make a habit of collecting...

386
00:41:13,887 --> 00:41:15,777
countries.

387
00:41:17,983 --> 00:41:22,040
Oh! We have no designs upon your sovereignty at all.

388
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,277
No none at all.

389
00:41:23,277 --> 00:41:25,569
You would assist us...

390
00:41:25,636 --> 00:41:28,686
in defense against mutual enemies?

391
00:41:45,318 --> 00:41:49,355
<i>So Orlando, I salute your country.</i>

392
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:53,566
To England, green and pleasant land.

393
00:42:24,401 --> 00:42:26,857
And...

394
00:42:28,986 --> 00:42:32,707
And I salute your country...

395
00:42:34,837 --> 00:42:36,563
So...

396
00:42:36,822 --> 00:42:38,481
spacious...

397
00:42:39,191 --> 00:42:40,985
And...

398
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:43,728
So... warm.

399
00:42:46,835 --> 00:42:48,638
Ah, yes.

400
00:42:48,849 --> 00:42:54,067
To the glorious sun which shines so brightly on this bountiful earth.

401
00:42:56,311 --> 00:42:57,875
Quite so.

402
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:00,052
Erm.

403
00:43:07,111 --> 00:43:08,703
Yes!

404
00:43:09,662 --> 00:43:10,890
Yes.

405
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:15,388
To beauty of nature.

406
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:18,083
And of course to the beauty of women.

407
00:43:18,189 --> 00:43:20,270
And the joys of love.

408
00:43:30,168 --> 00:43:31,856
I see.

409
00:43:32,105 --> 00:43:36,268
You're here as a casualty of love, my friend.

410
00:43:39,932 --> 00:43:42,886
They're not like us fellows.

411
00:43:46,329 --> 00:43:48,458
Women...

412
00:43:49,782 --> 00:43:51,959
it is said...

413
00:43:52,285 --> 00:43:54,127
man should...

414
00:43:54,482 --> 00:43:58,011
reverence his guarding lord who created them.

415
00:43:58,145 --> 00:44:03,459
And from from a single being created of like nature his mate.

416
00:44:04,437 --> 00:44:06,327
then from those two...

417
00:44:06,461 --> 00:44:08,542
scattered like seeds...

418
00:44:08,619 --> 00:44:10,460
countless men...

419
00:44:10,547 --> 00:44:12,379
and women.

420
00:44:15,966 --> 00:44:18,095
So Orlando...

421
00:44:23,293 --> 00:44:28,463
Let us now drink to brotherly love.

422
00:44:37,018 --> 00:44:39,877
To the manly virtues.

423
00:44:40,788 --> 00:44:42,543
Loyalty.

424
00:44:44,317 --> 00:44:46,188
Courage.

425
00:46:04,106 --> 00:46:06,792
<i>Take me to your master my dear fellow.</i>

426
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:12,470
<i>I said, take me to your master.</i>

427
00:46:13,534 --> 00:46:15,088
<i>Do you speak English?</i>

428
00:46:15,165 --> 00:46:17,294
<i>Do you speak English?</i>

429
00:46:18,416 --> 00:46:21,735
<i>Now look I can asure you he'll would want to see me.</i>

430
00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:24,890
<i>Just let me pass those, good now.</i>

431
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,928
Lord Ornaldo?

432
00:46:40,466 --> 00:46:41,876
I.. er...

433
00:46:43,746 --> 00:46:48,264
May I present myself, I am the archduke Harry.

434
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,765
Emissary from her majesty.

435
00:46:52,772 --> 00:46:56,455
I have come to inform you that your ten years here as ambassador...

436
00:46:56,762 --> 00:46:59,744
have been well appreciated by her majesty.

437
00:47:00,617 --> 00:47:03,389
would like to celebrate the new century...

438
00:47:03,523 --> 00:47:05,087
by raising you...

439
00:47:05,135 --> 00:47:07,005
to the highest rank...

440
00:47:07,043 --> 00:47:08,089
in the...

441
00:47:08,089 --> 00:47:09,499
peerage.

442
00:47:09,499 --> 00:47:10,736
Ahh.

443
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,546
There must be a party.

444
00:47:13,738 --> 00:47:16,538
well of course one must demonstrate the gravity of an investiture,

445
00:47:16,538 --> 00:47:20,557
A large party, food and entertainment.

446
00:47:20,701 --> 00:47:23,780
But of course you know that they call customs

447
00:47:23,933 --> 00:47:31,242
Exactly who you should invite, to the ball. Who's who.

448
00:48:15,687 --> 00:48:18,325
Strange.

449
00:48:18,545 --> 00:48:20,780
Most strange.

450
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:25,652
Perhaps they don't hold punctuality in high regard?

451
00:48:55,778 --> 00:48:59,375
As a representative of her majesty Queen Anne.

452
00:48:59,461 --> 00:49:01,293
I am pleased...

453
00:49:01,293 --> 00:49:03,211
and honored...

454
00:49:03,211 --> 00:49:07,048
to bestow the most noble Order of the Bath...

455
00:49:07,182 --> 00:49:09,570
upon this...

456
00:49:09,676 --> 00:49:12,074
loyal servant...

457
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:22,096
for ambassadorial services rendered...

458
00:49:22,096 --> 00:49:23,871
to the Crown...

459
00:49:23,871 --> 00:49:25,290
and...

460
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:28,120
for the glory of god.

461
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:53,498
- I'm sorry to arrive in this fashion but we must talk.
- But this is outrageous!

462
00:49:55,771 --> 00:50:00,212
I was expecting you as a guest at my party, I didn't realize you were entertaining hostilities.

463
00:50:00,682 --> 00:50:04,278
I was warned that Englishman would be dangerous for me.

464
00:50:04,576 --> 00:50:07,347
I would like to give you an opportunity to prove this wrong.

465
00:50:07,347 --> 00:50:10,839
Then let me introduce you, this is the archduke Harry from England.

466
00:50:10,982 --> 00:50:12,402
Delighted.

467
00:50:13,562 --> 00:50:15,001
Orlando.

468
00:50:15,327 --> 00:50:17,533
Our enemies are at the city wall.

469
00:50:19,586 --> 00:50:21,168
Will you help?

470
00:50:23,173 --> 00:50:25,916
You wish me to take arms?

471
00:50:26,031 --> 00:50:29,100
Truly Orlando you an Englishman are not afraid?

472
00:50:29,158 --> 00:50:30,635
Sir!

473
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:33,666
My Lord.

474
00:50:35,152 --> 00:50:38,154
Despite these appalling manners

475
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:41,559
we must keep our interests alive in this region.

476
00:50:42,307 --> 00:50:44,369
What do you recommend.

477
00:50:48,877 --> 00:50:51,294
- Harry, distribute your arms.
- But these fellows?

478
00:50:51,294 --> 00:50:53,606
- Do as I say!
- But sir!

479
00:51:14,744 --> 00:51:16,212
Follow me.

480
00:51:21,746 --> 00:51:23,213
Brother.

481
00:51:54,356 --> 00:51:56,188
Leave him.

482
00:51:57,041 --> 00:51:58,346
Leave him.

483
00:51:58,413 --> 00:52:00,686
This is a dying man.

484
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:03,487
He's not a man, he's the enemy.

485
00:54:53,567 --> 00:54:56,377
Same person.

486
00:54:56,463 --> 00:54:59,043
No difference at all.

487
00:55:02,697 --> 00:55:05,987
Just a different sex.

488
00:56:18,448 --> 00:56:21,882
Well, here I am again.

489
00:57:45,939 --> 00:57:49,843
SOCIETY

490
00:57:51,233 --> 00:57:54,398
Some more invitations my lady.

491
00:57:58,868 --> 00:58:02,052
Is not this the lady famed for her literary gatherings?

492
00:58:02,052 --> 00:58:06,752
Yes ma'am, but you could not possibly venture there. Alone.

493
00:58:06,876 --> 00:58:07,941
Why ever not?

494
00:58:07,941 --> 00:58:13,772
Society ma'am is full of dangerous individuals, which and... poets.

495
00:58:17,954 --> 00:58:26,011
<i>♫ Where you walk, call gale shall find the glade. ♫</i>

496
00:58:26,509 --> 00:58:29,320
And how is your leg now Mr. Swift?

497
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:34,739
I have to tell you that the gout have left my left leg and is traveled to my right.

498
00:58:34,739 --> 00:58:37,117
Aah, the conversation is of legs.

499
00:58:37,117 --> 00:58:38,460
Gout Mr. Pope.

500
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:40,455
You are an expert in this field?

501
00:58:40,522 --> 00:58:43,332
I believe I can say I have some knowledge.

502
00:58:43,524 --> 00:58:45,807
A little learning is a dangerous thing.

503
00:58:45,807 --> 00:58:50,612
Mr. Pope, I must write that down at once.

504
00:58:50,794 --> 00:58:53,048
I already have madam.

505
00:58:53,048 --> 00:58:57,431
If taken as a science the study of ailments can be quite fascinating.

506
00:58:57,585 --> 00:59:01,450
Indeed I believe science to be interesting than poetry.

507
00:59:05,382 --> 00:59:06,869
Do you?

508
00:59:08,375 --> 00:59:10,878
Appraise sir, Elaborate.

509
00:59:14,235 --> 00:59:18,992
We.. well the systematic study, exploration...

510
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:22,714
and taming of the material world...

511
00:59:22,771 --> 00:59:27,068
is surely a proper occupation for a man.

512
00:59:27,912 --> 00:59:29,667
Compared to which...

513
00:59:29,667 --> 00:59:33,676
the introvert art of scribbling...

514
00:59:46,538 --> 00:59:48,850
wishfully...

515
00:59:48,850 --> 00:59:52,417
the occupation of...of...

516
00:59:52,417 --> 00:59:54,336
a fool?

517
00:59:55,774 --> 00:59:59,371
So I admit a general rule that every poet is a fool.

518
00:59:59,477 --> 01:00:02,296
But you yourself may server to show it.

519
01:00:02,411 --> 01:00:05,222
That every fool is not a poet.

520
01:00:05,222 --> 01:00:10,094
Mr. Pope, you're pleased to be witty.

521
01:00:30,552 --> 01:00:35,674
They are all words and no breeding archduke.

522
01:00:35,769 --> 01:00:38,637
- But so amusing.
- Countess, forgive me.

523
01:00:38,637 --> 01:00:40,047
But the young lady who has joined us...

524
01:00:40,076 --> 01:00:43,711
...bears the extraordinary resemblance to...
- The Lady Orlando.

525
01:00:43,759 --> 01:00:45,696
Orlando.

526
01:00:48,104 --> 01:00:50,617
I were so proud of you Harry.

527
01:00:50,617 --> 01:00:52,535
The Order of the Bath.

528
01:00:52,535 --> 01:00:56,275
Marvelous. Cream?

529
01:01:26,977 --> 01:01:31,206
Well how pleasant it is I'd live to sip tea in the presence of a gracious lady.

530
01:01:31,302 --> 01:01:32,827
Do you Pestradus.

531
01:01:32,827 --> 01:01:39,829
As our good friend Dr. Johnson says Every man is or desires to be an... idler.

532
01:01:40,932 --> 01:01:43,867
Perhaps not every woman Mr. Swift.

533
01:01:44,672 --> 01:01:48,384
Women have no desires, only affectation.

534
01:01:48,384 --> 01:01:51,242
Indeed women are but children of larger growth.

535
01:01:51,242 --> 01:01:54,494
Aaa, but I consider woman to be a beautiful romantic animal.

536
01:01:54,551 --> 01:01:56,316
Who should be adorned in...

537
01:01:56,316 --> 01:01:59,289
Furs and feathers, pearls and diamonds.

538
01:01:59,289 --> 01:02:00,920
Apart from my wife of course.

539
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:03,452
Will insist upon attempting to learn greek.

540
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:08,199
It's so very unbecoming I can hardly tolerate her company at the breakfast table. Why do they do it?

541
01:02:08,228 --> 01:02:12,026
Oh, every woman is adverse to contradiction and frankly...

542
01:02:12,333 --> 01:02:14,741
most women have no characters at all.

543
01:02:15,105 --> 01:02:17,963
Present company accepted of course.

544
01:02:20,726 --> 01:02:23,603
Oh, the lady is aflame.

545
01:02:24,533 --> 01:02:26,154
And silent.

546
01:02:28,734 --> 01:02:30,288
Perfect.

547
01:02:34,527 --> 01:02:36,052
Gentlemen.

548
01:02:36,292 --> 01:02:38,258
I find it strange.

549
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:42,728
You are poets, each one of you and speak of your muse in the feminine.

550
01:02:42,881 --> 01:02:45,432
And yet you appear to feel neither tenderness...

551
01:02:45,490 --> 01:02:49,557
nor respect towards your wives nor towards females in general.

552
01:02:49,557 --> 01:02:55,503
Madam! I have only the highest regard and purest respect for females.

553
01:02:55,858 --> 01:02:58,994
I find no evidence of that sentiment in your conversation.

554
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:02,965
Conversation is a place where plays with ideas my dear lady.

555
01:03:03,186 --> 01:03:05,382
The one forges them quite alone.

556
01:03:05,430 --> 01:03:07,530
- Quite so.
- Quite. Quite.

557
01:03:07,808 --> 01:03:10,225
The intellect is a solitary place.

558
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:16,479
And therefore quite unsuitable a terrain for females who must discover their natures through the guidance of a father or husband.

559
01:03:18,013 --> 01:03:20,200
And if she has neither?

560
01:03:20,594 --> 01:03:22,118
Then...

561
01:03:22,205 --> 01:03:24,938
However charming she may be dear lady...

562
01:03:26,569 --> 01:03:28,276
She is lost.

563
01:03:35,498 --> 01:03:38,414
None of us knew what had happened.

564
01:03:38,788 --> 01:03:40,390
It is extraordinary.

565
01:03:40,390 --> 01:03:44,274
And to think we could have been so charmingly misled.

566
01:04:01,826 --> 01:04:05,624
Dear Lady! Orlando!

567
01:04:10,266 --> 01:04:11,820
The same.

568
01:04:12,338 --> 01:04:14,908
We wish to inform you.

569
01:04:15,954 --> 01:04:17,766
Madam.

570
01:04:18,169 --> 01:04:23,770
That you are a party to several major lawsuits that have been preferred against you concerning the property.

571
01:04:23,770 --> 01:04:25,900
The family seat.

572
01:04:26,983 --> 01:04:28,288
Pray continue.

573
01:04:28,518 --> 01:04:30,206
Erh heh.

574
01:04:31,616 --> 01:04:37,141
One: You are legally dead and therefore cannot hold any property whatsoever.

575
01:04:37,217 --> 01:04:38,311
Ah.

576
01:04:39,270 --> 01:04:40,229
Fine.

577
01:04:40,334 --> 01:04:46,060
Two: You are now female.
- Which amounts much the same thing.

578
01:04:46,127 --> 01:04:49,072
Pending the legal judgment however..

579
01:04:49,168 --> 01:04:52,717
You have the laws permission to reside in the property

580
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:58,548
- in a state of incognito.
- Or incognita as the case may be.

581
01:05:00,092 --> 01:05:04,082
- Harry!
- There is only one solution in your current predicament.

582
01:05:04,274 --> 01:05:05,569
Indeed.

583
01:05:05,684 --> 01:05:09,539
I can offer you a house to rival your own.

584
01:05:10,633 --> 01:05:12,330
I don't quite understand.

585
01:05:12,369 --> 01:05:13,961
I confess.

586
01:05:13,961 --> 01:05:18,689
Orlando, to me you were and always will be, weather male or female...

587
01:05:18,757 --> 01:05:23,130
The pink the pearl and the perfection of your ?seas?.

588
01:05:27,609 --> 01:05:30,093
I'm offering you my hand.

589
01:05:31,398 --> 01:05:34,390
Oh! Archduke.

590
01:05:34,448 --> 01:05:37,584
That is very kind of you, yes.

591
01:05:37,632 --> 01:05:39,502
I can't accept.

592
01:05:40,164 --> 01:05:41,526
But I...

593
01:05:42,236 --> 01:05:44,701
I, am England.

594
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:47,674
And you are mine.

595
01:05:47,751 --> 01:05:49,352
I see.

596
01:05:49,583 --> 01:05:51,453
On what grounds?

597
01:05:52,258 --> 01:05:54,244
That I adore you.

598
01:05:54,791 --> 01:05:57,831
And this means that I belong to you?

599
01:05:58,358 --> 01:06:01,447
- Are you refusing me?
- I am, I'm sorry.

600
01:06:01,850 --> 01:06:04,046
But Orlando.

601
01:06:04,238 --> 01:06:07,259
With your history quite frankly who else will have you?

602
01:06:07,710 --> 01:06:09,829
Do you realize what you're turning down?

603
01:06:10,098 --> 01:06:15,479
With your ambiguous sexuality which I am prepared to tolerate.

604
01:06:16,236 --> 01:06:19,545
This is your last chance of respectability.

605
01:06:19,545 --> 01:06:20,984
Can't breathe.

606
01:06:21,042 --> 01:06:25,147
You will die a spinster, dispossessed and alone.

607
01:06:35,985 --> 01:06:37,979
Spinster!

608
01:06:41,336 --> 01:06:42,986
Alone!

609
01:07:41,224 --> 01:07:47,870
Nature, nature, I'm your bride. Take me!

610
01:08:02,727 --> 01:08:06,976
SEX

611
01:08:25,103 --> 01:08:26,734
You're hurt ma'am?

612
01:08:26,916 --> 01:08:28,834
I'm dead, sir.

613
01:08:29,122 --> 01:08:31,874
Dead. That's serious. Can I help?

614
01:08:32,872 --> 01:08:34,627
Will you marry me?

615
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:41,398
Ma'am... I would gladly... um, I... but I fear my ankle is twisted.

616
01:08:55,891 --> 01:08:57,560
What's that?

617
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:59,478
The future.

618
01:09:23,149 --> 01:09:27,091
Some milk? My god I don't yet know your name, sir.

619
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:30,966
How strange, I feel as though I know everything about you.

620
01:09:31,071 --> 01:09:34,322
When like meets like. My name is Shelmerdine.

621
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:35,838
Orlando.

622
01:09:35,886 --> 01:09:39,885
So..it only remains to fill in such unimportant details as..

623
01:09:39,952 --> 01:09:41,976
What we do and so on.

624
01:09:42,283 --> 01:09:44,815
Well you can see for yourself what I was.

625
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:46,733
Was?

626
01:10:13,857 --> 01:10:16,926
You see, I'm about to loose everything.

627
01:10:19,382 --> 01:10:22,000
Then you can come with me.

628
01:10:23,947 --> 01:10:25,856
Where are you going?

629
01:10:26,354 --> 01:10:28,292
Back to America?

630
01:10:28,580 --> 01:10:31,131
When the wind changes to the south-west.

631
01:10:35,092 --> 01:10:37,288
America.

632
01:10:37,739 --> 01:10:39,446
I've been abroad.

633
01:10:39,562 --> 01:10:41,365
But east.

634
01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:44,424
Then you know as well as I, how good it is to travel.

635
01:10:46,889 --> 01:10:48,462
Like a free spirit.

636
01:10:48,587 --> 01:10:51,368
Unfeathered by position or possession.

637
01:10:55,982 --> 01:10:57,583
Unfeathered.

638
01:10:59,549 --> 01:11:01,103
Are you...

639
01:11:01,199 --> 01:11:04,364
An adventurer by profession?

640
01:11:07,328 --> 01:11:10,982
My profession, if you can call it that...

641
01:11:11,107 --> 01:11:13,159
it's the pursuit of liberty.

642
01:11:15,327 --> 01:11:19,653
The bright shade, of some immortal dream.

643
01:11:20,266 --> 01:11:23,767
Which walks when tempus sleeps.

644
01:11:24,007 --> 01:11:27,364
The wave of life's dark stream.

645
01:11:28,476 --> 01:11:31,114
You don't really want a husband.

646
01:11:31,843 --> 01:11:35,277
I suppose your journey is to be hazardous at times.

647
01:11:35,564 --> 01:11:38,221
Think, you want a lover.

648
01:11:38,835 --> 01:11:40,782
You've fought in battles?

649
01:11:40,878 --> 01:11:43,093
Like a man?

650
01:11:43,304 --> 01:11:45,271
I have fought.

651
01:11:45,673 --> 01:11:47,189
Blood?

652
01:11:47,467 --> 01:11:49,519
If necessary, yes.

653
01:11:49,788 --> 01:11:53,365
Freedom must be taken, if it must be won.

654
01:11:55,907 --> 01:11:58,123
If I were a man...

655
01:11:58,401 --> 01:11:59,935
You?

656
01:12:01,873 --> 01:12:06,726
I might choose not to risk my life for an uncertain cause.

657
01:12:07,388 --> 01:12:12,020
I might think that freedom won by death is not worth having.

658
01:12:13,852 --> 01:12:15,013
In fact...

659
01:12:15,109 --> 01:12:19,415
You might choose not to be a real man at all.

660
01:12:22,369 --> 01:12:24,364
Say, if I were a woman...

661
01:12:25,793 --> 01:12:27,328
You?

662
01:12:28,028 --> 01:12:33,159
I might choose not to sacrifice my life caring for my children,

663
01:12:33,370 --> 01:12:36,084
nor my children's children,

664
01:12:36,276 --> 01:12:40,487
nor to drown anonymously in the milk of female kindness,

665
01:12:41,005 --> 01:12:45,513
but instead, say, to go abroad.

666
01:12:46,980 --> 01:12:49,109
Would I then be...

667
01:12:51,334 --> 01:12:54,691
A real woman?

668
01:13:13,404 --> 01:13:20,060
I think I'm going to faint. I've never felt better in my life.

669
01:15:55,312 --> 01:15:59,283
Rise, from pains of thee.

670
01:16:00,395 --> 01:16:04,260
From first sweet sleep of night.

671
01:16:04,999 --> 01:16:08,471
Winds are breathing low.

672
01:16:08,807 --> 01:16:12,614
Heavens stars are shining bright.

673
01:16:22,512 --> 01:16:25,793
But it is day.

674
01:16:27,135 --> 01:16:30,425
Days are nice.

675
01:16:31,039 --> 01:16:34,885
Mingling are sweet embrace on end.

676
01:16:42,942 --> 01:16:44,073
Who's there?

677
01:16:44,073 --> 01:16:49,272
Excuse me my lady, there are two officers outside with a warrant from the queen.

678
01:16:49,329 --> 01:16:50,864
The queen?

679
01:16:50,912 --> 01:16:55,487
Victoria, ma'am. The gentlemen say they must speak to you in person.

680
01:16:57,664 --> 01:16:59,371
Oh.

681
01:16:59,889 --> 01:17:02,584
I'd almost forgotten.

682
01:17:07,706 --> 01:17:10,190
Her ladyship.

683
01:17:11,888 --> 01:17:14,103
The lawsuit is settled.

684
01:17:14,257 --> 01:17:20,232
My sex is pronounced indisputably and beyond shadow of a doubt... female...

685
01:17:20,414 --> 01:17:26,581
Therefore heirs made of my body will risk it taking as red. I loose everything unless I have a son!

686
01:17:34,264 --> 01:17:36,173
So you're free.

687
01:17:36,336 --> 01:17:40,220
I think the spirit of this century is finally taken me and broken me.

688
01:17:41,093 --> 01:17:43,519
I would be sad if it were true.

689
01:17:43,980 --> 01:17:45,505
But it is not.

690
01:17:45,716 --> 01:17:47,490
Come with me.

691
01:17:47,615 --> 01:17:49,648
I cannot.

692
01:17:49,945 --> 01:17:51,720
I can't just follow you.

693
01:17:51,835 --> 01:17:57,062
You can stay and stagnate in the past or leave and live for the future, the choice is yours.

694
01:17:57,302 --> 01:18:02,002
- As a man one has choices, Shelmerdine.
- Orlando, you can do whatever you want.

695
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:04,457
Would you like to have a child with me?

696
01:18:04,553 --> 01:18:06,615
So that you can keep your house?

697
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:10,854
No, not for the house Shelmerdine. Perhaps for love?

698
01:18:11,123 --> 01:18:14,010
These are the times that try men's souls.

699
01:18:14,096 --> 01:18:17,127
My love is for mankind, I must fight for liberty.

700
01:18:17,127 --> 01:18:20,359
- I must fight for a future.
- For a future?

701
01:18:20,484 --> 01:18:25,538
This future of yours Shelmerdine, when it's gonna begin... today?

702
01:18:25,586 --> 01:18:27,946
or is it always tomorrow?

703
01:18:28,224 --> 01:18:31,245
Touché Orlando.

704
01:18:38,074 --> 01:18:40,990
The wind!

705
01:18:41,364 --> 01:18:43,627
The wind.

706
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:46,677
The south-west wind.

707
01:19:12,487 --> 01:19:16,640
Good bye, Shelmerdine! Good luck!

708
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:18,865
Orlando!

709
01:20:58,325 --> 01:21:02,229
BIRTH

710
01:21:12,866 --> 01:21:15,503
It's really very good.

711
01:21:16,338 --> 01:21:20,068
Written from the heart.

712
01:21:21,181 --> 01:21:23,560
I think it'll sell.

713
01:21:24,289 --> 01:21:27,108
Provided you rewrite it. You know.

714
01:21:27,195 --> 01:21:31,175
Increase the love interest. Give it a happy ending.

715
01:21:31,683 --> 01:21:35,798
By the way, how long did this draft take you?

716
01:23:10,242 --> 01:23:12,103
Come on. Come on.

717
01:23:12,103 --> 01:23:13,570
<i>She.</i>

718
01:23:14,002 --> 01:23:17,272
<i>For there can be no doubt about her sex.</i>

719
01:23:17,416 --> 01:23:23,440
<i>Is visiting the house she finally lost for the first time in over a hundred years.</i>

720
01:23:23,823 --> 01:23:27,717
<i>She does still have certain natural advantages of course.</i>

721
01:23:27,871 --> 01:23:34,911
<i>She is tall and slim, with a slightly androgynous appearance that many females at the time aspire to.</i>

722
01:23:35,045 --> 01:23:37,558
<i>Then her upbringing,</i>

723
01:23:37,558 --> 01:23:42,603
<i>she's lived for four hundred years and hardly aged a day.</i>

724
01:23:43,063 --> 01:23:44,991
<i>And because this is England.</i>

725
01:23:45,039 --> 01:23:48,348
<i>Everyone pretends not to notice.</i>

726
01:23:48,914 --> 01:23:51,609
<i>But she has changed.</i>

727
01:23:51,896 --> 01:23:55,407
<i>She is no longer trapped by destiny.</i>

728
01:23:55,762 --> 01:24:00,087
<i>And... ever since she let go of the past...</i>

729
01:24:00,557 --> 01:24:03,847
<i>She found her life was beginning.</i>

730
01:24:33,167 --> 01:24:35,699
<i>♫ I am coming! I am coming! ♫</i>

731
01:24:35,718 --> 01:24:37,819

01:25:00,109 --> 01:25:02,344
Why are you sad?

738
01:25:02,439 --> 01:25:05,326
I'm not. I'm happy.

739
01:25:05,422 --> 01:25:08,137
Look. Look up there.

740
01:25:08,185 --> 01:25:10,707
<i>♫ Yes at last, at last ♫</i>
