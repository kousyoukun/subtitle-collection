1
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,300
That fair her seems...

2
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,830
That fair her seems the
less ye see her may.

3
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,860
Lo see soon after how...

4
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:44,370
Modesty.

5
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,560
There are things that she'll see.

6
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:51,340
Lo see soon after how... more
bold and free her bared bosom...

7
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,968
A see the virgin rose...
How sweetly she...

8
00:01:02,068 --> 00:01:03,660
...doth peep forth
with bashful modesty.

9
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,740
There can be no
doubt about his sex.

10
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,650
Despite the feminine
appearance that...

11
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,640
...every young man at
the time aspires to.

12
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:15,830
And there can be no doubt
about his upbringing.

13
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:16,920
Good food.

14
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,250
Education.

15
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,260
A nanny.

16
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,970
Loneliness and isolation.

17
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,930
And...because this is England...

18
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:28,701
Orlando would therefore
seem destined...

19
00:01:28,801 --> 00:01:30,830
...to have his
portrait on the wall.

20
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,010
And his name in the history books.

21
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,480
But when he...

22
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:37,760
That is...

23
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,230
I

24
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:41,580
Came into the world.

25
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,280
He was looking for something else.

26
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,710
Though heir to a name that meant
power, land and property...

27
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,880
Surely when Orlando was born...

28
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,480
...it wasn't privilege he sought...

29
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,960
...but company.

30
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,150
¶ Eliza ¶...

31
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:49,730
...¶ Eliza's eyes are
blessed stars, ¶...

32
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:54,980
...¶ Inducing peace,
subduing wars. ¶...

33
00:02:55,450 --> 00:03:00,430
...¶ O blessed be each
day and hour ¶...

34
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:06,470
...¶ Where sweet Eliza
builds her bower. ¶...

35
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:11,410
...¶ O blessed be each
day and hour ¶...

36
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:18,240
...¶ Where sweet Eliza
builds her bower. ¶...

37
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,260
...¶ Eliza ¶...

38
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,960
...¶ Eliza ¶...

39
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:29,420
...¶ Eliza is the
fairest queen ¶...

40
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:35,190
...¶ That ever trod
upon the green. ¶...

41
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,420
...¶ Eliza ¶...

42
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,580
...¶ Eliza's eyes are
blessed stars, ¶...

43
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:49,010
...¶ Inducing peace,
subduing wars. ¶...

44
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:54,250
...¶ O blessed be each
day and hour ¶...

45
00:03:54,250 --> 00:04:00,020
...¶ Where sweet Eliza
builds her bower. ¶...

46
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:05,190
...¶ O blessed be each
day and hour ¶...

47
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:11,800
...¶ Where sweet Eliza
builds her bower. ¶...

48
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,850
...¶ Eliza ¶...

00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,400

00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:29,410
...¶ That ever trod

52
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:33,490
...¶ Eliza ¶...

53
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:38,790
...¶ Eliza's breast is
that fair hill, ¶...

54
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:44,380
...¶ Where virtue dwells,
and sacred skill. ¶...

55
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:49,850
...¶ O blessed be each
day and hour ¶...

56
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:55,690
...¶ Where sweet Eliza
builds her bower. ¶

57
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,920
More wine my lord?

58
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,580
A see the virgin rose.

59
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,480
How sweetly she doth
first peep forth

60
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,660
With bashful modesty.

61
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:01,380
That fair her seems the
less ye see her may.

62
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,310
Lo see soon after how..

63
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:09,310
more bold and free her bared
bosom she doth broad display

64
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:13,180
Lo see soon after how she fades...

65
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,340
...and falls away.

66
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,440
so passeth in th..

67
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,140
Is this a worthy topic?

68
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:24,830
From one so clearly in
the bloom of youth.

69
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,130
To one who would desire it still?

70
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:32,610
Fair virgo gratious majesty,

71
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:36,250
Your bloom is legendary,

72
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:40,130
and these were of course not
the sentiments of our son,

73
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:42,130
but of a poet.

74
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,290
Now what would please you?

75
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:49,860
All that is mine is
here for your pleasure.

76
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:54,380
All you call yours is mine already.

77
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,710
Come.

78
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:34,810
Your leg.

79
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:52,200
I want you here in England with me.

80
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:55,880
You will be the son
of my old age...

81
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,100
...and the limb of my infirmity.

82
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,440
My favourite.

83
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,640
My mascot.

84
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,690
Come.

85
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,790
Aah, this is my victory.

86
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:50,220
Come, your handsome leg.

87
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:08,410
For you and for your heirs Orlando.

88
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,770
The house.

89
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,270
Your Majesty.

90
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,300
I'm forever i...

91
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,860
But on one condition.

92
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,720
Do not fade.

93
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,980
Do not wither.

94
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:28,180
Do not grow old.

95
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,570
Very interesting person.

96
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:41,320
First the queen and now his father.

97
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,540
It is too sad.

98
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,950
Mourning so becomes him.

99
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,670
One can quite see why
he was the favourite.

100
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:50,880
My dear friends how can you?

101
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,230
In his time of grief.

102
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,570
That way.

103
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:30,010
Sasha.

104
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,760
Who's that?

105
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:55,920
I believe she is the daughter
of the muscovite ambassador.

106
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
How the delightful.

107
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,080
If that's to your taste.

108
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,190
What ever can you mean?

109
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:07,000
Oh, smearing themselves with
candle wax to keep warm.

110
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:09,990
Wearing beards as they get
older, that kind of thing.

111
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:12,300
Perhaps in this you're
mistaken, Moray.

112
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,750
Told me on good authority
by Lord Francis Vere.

113
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,120
Does he travel to muscovite.

114
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,220
He knows someone who did.

115
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:20,270
Aah.

116
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,270
This is the Lady Euphrosyne.

117
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,710
The Lord Winchelsea.

118
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,900
The Lord Orlando.

119
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,070
The Earl of Moray.

120
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:07,170
Moray....

121
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:10,470
And I am Lord Francis Vere.

122
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,210
Ochin Liesna.

123
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:14,310
- Sorry?
- Enchanté.

124
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,670
- Enchanted.
- Aah.

125
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:22,490
And my name is
Alexandra Menchikova.

126
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:25,030
But my father calls me Sasha.

127
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:28,530
Enchanté.

128
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,350
Here doing some quail.

129
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:31,930
Spasiba.

130
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:34,060
Do they have quail in Russia?

131
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,390
Do you speak French?

132
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:38,490
A little.

133
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:42,193
But the most Englishmen
can't, or do...

134
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:44,883
...not want to speak
other languages.

135
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:48,400
How do they communicate
with strangers then?

136
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:51,370
They speak English louder.

137
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:54,190
Please tell the
ambassador that this,

138
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:59,220
great frost is the most severe ever
to have visited these islands.

139
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:03,453
Erh, tell him that in
Norfolk a young country...

140
00:17:03,553 --> 00:17:06,773
...woman was seen to turn
visibly to powder...

141
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:11,540
...and was blown away in a
puff of dust in the icy blast.

142
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,650
Most amusing.

143
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:20,090
Don't worry my dear, this absurd
affection will not last the season.

144
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,890
After all..

145
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:23,990
She's a foreigner.

146
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:15,640
My Lord Orlando, you're in
danger of becoming a fool.

147
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,932
You're ruining what
could be the finest...

148
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:19,690
...career in the land and for what?

149
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:22,310
I no longer care
for a career, Moray.

150
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,390
I'm only interested in love.

151
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,897
Don't you see in courting
a Cossack, you're...

152
00:19:27,997 --> 00:19:30,230
...humiliating not
only your fiancé...

153
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:33,970
...but the entire female
population of this country.

154
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,990
Besides which, they have nothing.

155
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,320
Why do you think they're here?

156
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,832
For your sake I would
hunt wolf instead of...

157
00:20:22,932 --> 00:20:24,570
...rabbit drinking vodka
instead of whiskey.

158
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:25,650
How generous.

159
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,870
As for marriage to the good
Lady Euphrosyne the thing is...

160
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:29,870
...so probably absurd that I
scarcely give it a thought.

161
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:30,950
How gallant.

162
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:33,968
I feel as if I've been hooked
through the nose and rushed...

163
00:20:34,068 --> 00:20:36,640
...through the waters painfully
yet with my own consent.

164
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,740
How brave.

165
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:47,240
My Lord, have you quite
forgotten that we are betrothed?

166
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,900
My Lady, I'm being
constantly reminded.

167
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,990
You speak so lightly of it.

168
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,790
You've betrayed me.

169
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:57,490
The treachery of men.

170
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,600
It would never have worked.

171
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:09,490
A man must follow his heart.

172
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:00,630
There.

173
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,420
Where you live?

174
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,520
I do.

175
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:06,810
By yourself?

176
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,040
Well, yes.

177
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,620
At the moment.

178
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,170
No brother?

179
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:22,540
No sister?

180
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,490
You Sasha?

181
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,460
If I had brother I
wouldn't be here.

182
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,200
My father only has me.

183
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,970
Nothing thicker than
a knifes blade...

184
00:23:18,018 --> 00:23:20,480
...separates melancholy
from happiness.

185
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:23,040
Why are you sad?

186
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,500
Because.

187
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,190
Because I can't bear
this happiness to end.

188
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,740
But we are together.

189
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,480
Yes, now.

190
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:39,470
But what about tomorrow?

191
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:41,570
And the day after?

192
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:44,670
Orlando.

193
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:47,110
I think you suffer from
a strange melancholy.

194
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:49,870
Which is, you suffer in advance.

195
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,670
Look at me. Look.

196
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:01,350
You are too serious, Orlando.

197
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,970
And yet not serious enough.

198
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:11,410
- Shadows, you saw shadows.
- You were in his arms.

199
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:14,270
- It was illusion in light.
- Then what were you doing?

200
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:17,670
- He was taking me across deck.
- But I saw you.

201
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:19,910
May gods destroy me, if I family

202
00:25:19,992 --> 00:25:22,582
Menchikov would lie
in arm of sailor.

203
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,620
Sasha.

204
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:29,940
I cannot think of
a life without you.

205
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:31,950
Stay with me.

206
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:35,090
- Don't ever go.
- But it's impossible.

207
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:37,130
But why?

208
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:39,300
Because when ice breaks we must go.

209
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,740
But we're linked.

210
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:44,920
Our destinies are linked.

211
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:48,240
You're mine.

212
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,340
Why?

213
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:53,170
Because I adore you.

214
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,790
Meet me at midnight
at London bridge.

215
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:00,230
We'll fly away as free as birds.

216
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:03,660
Lots of air, very fresh.

217
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,860
There.

218
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:09,500
It's decided.

219
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:18,760
your lessons, speak now his
now his a lot with peace within

220
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,760
Speak of me as I am.

221
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:26,270
Nothing extenuates nor
sits down aught in malice.

222
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,790
Then speak of one.

223
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:36,590
Who loved lord wisely but to well

224
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:40,070
But one whom not easily jealous

225
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:43,080
But being wrought,
perplexed in the extreme

226
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:47,090
Of one whose hand, like
the base Indian...

227
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:49,300
...threw a pearl away.

228
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,660
worth more than all his tribe.

229
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:00,020
I kissed thee ear. I killed thee.

230
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,270
No way but this.

231
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,980
By killing myself...

232
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:08,380
To die upon a kiss.

233
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:14,370
Terrific play.

234
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:58,080
She will. She will be here.

235
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,700
Help. Help.

236
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:35,390
The treachery of women.

237
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,400
Ehm, ehm.

238
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,700
Ehm.

239
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,680
Good morning.

240
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,050
It's now time to awake.

241
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:26,290
To such a fine morning.

242
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:32,880
From such a long refreshing sleep.

243
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:40,940
- Six days you say?
- Tomorrow will be the seventh.

244
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:55,100
¶ This pleasing
shining wondrous day. ¶

245
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:12,420
The Lord Orlando...

246
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,520
...is sleeping.

247
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:27,950
I can find only three words
to describe the female sex.

248
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,090
None of which are worth expressing.

249
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:46,290
When in disgrace with
fortune and men's eyes.

250
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:51,220
I all alone be weep
my outcast state.

251
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,740
and trouble heaven...

252
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,530
...with my bootless cries.

253
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:01,400
and look upon myself...

254
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:04,450
...and curse my fate.

255
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:13,810
Aah.

256
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:16,250
Poetry.

257
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,780
Get off.

258
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:40,720
Get off.

259
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,820
Off. Off.

260
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,840
Thank you.

261
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:09,070
I was thinking.

262
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,430
Sitting here, as we are.

263
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:19,540
It's odd. Considering how
common the name of Greene is,

264
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:22,220
that the Greene family came
over with the conquerer.

265
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,320
And is in fact,

266
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,970
from the highest
nobility in France.

267
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:29,070
Oh.

268
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,230
Oh, really?

269
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:37,690
Unfortunately the Greens came
down in the world and erm..

270
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:42,580
We've little more than leave our
name to the burrower of Greenwich.

271
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:47,100
And now Mr Greene to the subject
closer to my heart and yours.

272
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,340
The sacred subject of poetry.

273
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:51,340
Aah.

274
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:57,420
You know, I once broke a lady's fan
in my enthusiasm to find a rime.

275
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:00,080
Enthusiasm can be dangerous.

276
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:05,160
As a youth I was often mocked for
my love of poetry and solitude.

277
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:07,190
Tragic.

278
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:10,677
And of course Mr
Greene, your works...

279
00:34:10,777 --> 00:34:13,410
...hold pride of
place in my library.

280
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:14,300
Uh-uh.

281
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,869
To me there is a
certain glory about...

282
00:34:16,969 --> 00:34:19,050
...a man who can
express in words...

283
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:23,270
...those great emotions
that others can only feel.

284
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:25,920
Oh.

285
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:30,220
You know I scarcely dared to
ask to make your acquaintance...

286
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:33,710
...for I feel that I can
offer nothing in return.

287
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,851
I'm sure that any
writer would be more...

288
00:34:35,951 --> 00:34:37,990
...than willing to
except your hospitality.

289
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:40,090
Oh, do you think so?

290
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:42,430
If we would speak of poetry...

291
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:46,090
...then let us first
speak of poets lives.

292
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,780
Do you know how
'Hamlet' was written?

293
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:52,010
Written while bailiffs were
pounding on Shakespeare's door.

294
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:54,700
No wonder so many of his
plays were falsey too.

295
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,800
Aw, I'm sure you're right.

296
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:01,670
How can a...How can a genius work
when he cannot pay the bills?

297
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,460
When I say work...

298
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,400
Erm, work you see... is...

299
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,590
...people who haven't laboured
in this way don't understand...

300
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:13,760
...that real poetry neither
easy nor easily produced.

301
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:16,700
Then I feel that I can
understand a little Mr Greene.

302
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,670
Because I have myself
been so righteous...

303
00:35:19,712 --> 00:35:22,232
...to attempt to
write some poems...

304
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,760
Did I hear a mouse's squeak?

305
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:28,450
I must say I didn't hear any.

306
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:30,740
That's saying you're
in good health.

307
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:35,450
My own my lord have been so bad
it's a marvel I'm still alive.

308
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:40,020
I have an enlarged heart, a
spleen and a diseased liver.

309
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:46,010
Above all there are sensations in
my spine which defy description.

310
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:49,930
There is one nob about a third from
the top which burns like fire.

311
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:53,580
Second from the
bottom...cold as ice.

312
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:58,230
Sometimes I feel as if a
thousand wax tapers were alight.

313
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:02,430
And people were throwing
fireworks inside my brain and I...

314
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:04,490
I'm so sensitive.

315
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:07,890
I can feel a rose leaf
through my mattress.

316
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,870
In short.

317
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:13,500
I'm a piece of machinery
so finely made...

318
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,330
...and curiously put together...

319
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:18,580
...that it confounds me to think

320
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:22,020
That I've only sold
115 copies of my poem.

321
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:24,368
But it has to be said this
is largely due to what...

322
00:36:24,468 --> 00:36:26,530
...can only be descried as
a conspiracy against me.

323
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,854
But Mr Greene surely
your work is...

324
00:36:28,954 --> 00:36:31,240
...widely admired by
all the young poets?

325
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,961
Including dare I say it...

326
00:36:33,061 --> 00:36:36,610
All young writers will turn
at any trash that will sell.

327
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:38,290
It hurts me to say it.

328
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:41,730
For I love literature,
as I love life.

329
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:45,620
But the art of poetry
is dead in England.

330
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,620
You think so?

331
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:51,710
Of course... erhm...

332
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,100
That I have pension...

333
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,990
...of...

334
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:58,090
...300 pounds a year?

335
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,840
paid...

336
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,640
...quarterly...

337
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,760
I'd live for literature alone..

338
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:06,380
I'd dedicate myself
to fine writing.

339
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:10,230
But...sadly...

340
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:13,610
It's necessary to have
a pension to do it.

341
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:16,490
About 300 pounds a year.

342
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:20,610
Paid quarterly.

343
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,578
Mr Greene, I wonder
would you be so kind...

344
00:37:23,678 --> 00:37:25,750
...as to give me your
opinion of my efforts?

345
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:29,250
By all means... If
I can find the time.

346
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,560
For time is money.

347
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:33,760
And I must write to eat.

348
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,077
We're not in the pursuit of art.

349
00:37:36,177 --> 00:37:40,060
Of course I will arrange for the
small matter of the 300 pounds.

350
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,450
To be paid...

351
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,500
Quarterly?

352
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,560
- As you wish.
- My dear friend.

353
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:50,290
'Death of a lover'.

354
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:04,780
Listen to this my friend.
This is the great work

355
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:07,785
Of my gracious host,
the soon to be,

356
00:38:07,885 --> 00:38:10,780
congratulate me
friend, my pension...

357
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,100
'His heart was broken'

358
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:15,290
'cleft in two'

359
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:18,350
'abandoned, lost'

360
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:20,490
'what could he do?'

361
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:24,140
'And into this he retched cried'

362
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,260
'She said she loved me'

363
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,130
'But she lied'

364
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:31,250
'And so betrayed'

365
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:34,360
'He fell and died'.

366
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:49,860
Try as he might.

367
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:53,790
This gracious noble lord.

368
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:56,510
Who lifts his pen.

369
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:58,870
And thinks he then can write.

370
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:03,330
Cannot, for who can pen.

371
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:06,040
When he is bored.

372
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:12,080
The mind of leisure
only can be trite.

373
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:16,950
This pretty knight who
feebly lifts his sword

374
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:20,740
To make a witless thrust
against his doom.

375
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:24,090
Is foiled by what his
noble birth affords

376
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:28,380
Dogs, dogs more dogs
and far too many rooms.

377
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:33,140
So fortune smiles on
those that own the land

378
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:37,800
And frowns at the trivia
from the dabblers hand.

379
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:49,870
I would like you to drop this in
the midst of the filthiest manure.

380
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,110
And Mr Greene's pension, sir?

381
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:55,140
Pay it, quarterly.

382
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,360
Abroad?

383
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:10,500
As your ambassador, your majesty.

384
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,280
Ambassador?

385
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:14,553
I see, once the balance of power...

386
00:40:14,653 --> 00:40:16,890
...has been established
here in Europe.

387
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:21,000
We must certainly turn
our attention to the east.

388
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,280
Well Orlando.

389
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,900
I fear you will be quite
starved of conversation...

390
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:31,730
...and amusement in such a
remote corner of the world.

391
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:36,890
However, I believe they
have an interest in...

392
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:39,230
...horticulture.

393
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:45,210
I'd like you to bring
them some tulips.

394
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:54,350
POLITICS

395
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:29,420
My dear sir, please
accept my hospitality.

396
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:33,680
Feel that my home is your home.

397
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:38,010
And call upon me as you would a
brother, for any of your needs.

398
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:40,480
You really are to kind.

399
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:44,535
And I must say I'm
most impressed by...

400
00:42:44,635 --> 00:42:46,420
...your command of
the English language.

401
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:49,280
I hadn't expect... I mean...

402
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:51,490
I wasn't led to believe...

403
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:55,210
Why...are you here?

404
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,780
I'm here as a representative
of his majesty's government.

405
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,880
Yes?

406
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:04,260
It has been said to me that the

407
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,960
English make a habit
of collecting...

408
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,720
...countries.

409
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:16,220
Oh. We have no designs upon
your sovereignty at all.

410
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:17,410
No one at all.

411
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:19,900
You would assist us...

412
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:23,150
...in defence against
mutual enemies?

413
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:44,700
So Orlando, I salute your country.

414
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:49,090
To England, green
and pleasant land.

415
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,800
And...

416
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:29,900
And I salute your country...

417
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:34,120
So...

418
00:44:34,190 --> 00:44:36,190
...spacious...

419
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:38,660
And...

420
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:41,390
So... warm.

421
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:46,630
Ah, yes.

422
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:52,170
To the glorious sun which shines so
brightly on this bountiful earth.

423
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:56,510
Quite so.

424
00:44:57,470 --> 00:44:59,470
Erm.

425
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:07,770
Yes.

426
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:10,430
Yes.

427
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:14,570
To beauty of nature.

428
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:17,220
And of course to
the beauty of women.

429
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:19,490
And the joys of love.

430
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:31,810
I see.

431
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:36,170
You're here as a casualty
of love, my friend.

432
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:43,070
They're not like us fellows.

433
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,880
Women...

434
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:52,530
...it is said...

435
00:45:52,870 --> 00:45:54,870
...man should...

436
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:58,840
...reverence his guarding
lord who created them.

437
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:04,520
And from a single being
created of like nature his mate.

438
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:07,540
then from those two...

439
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:09,820
...scattered like seeds...

440
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,900
...countless men...

441
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:13,910
...and women.

442
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,780
So Orlando...

443
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:30,590
Let us now drink to brotherly love.

444
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:42,490
To the manly virtues.

445
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,440
Loyalty.

446
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,120
Courage.

447
00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:13,110
Take me to your master
my dear fellow.

448
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:19,030
I said, take me to your master.

449
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:21,740
Do you speak English?

450
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:24,060
Do you speak English?

451
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:28,710
Now look I can assure you
he'll would want to see me.

452
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:31,980
Just let me pass those, good now.

453
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:40,360
Lord Orlando?

454
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:50,220
I.. erh...

455
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:56,350
May I present myself, I
am the archduke Harry.

456
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:00,000
Emissary from her majesty.

457
00:49:01,050 --> 00:49:05,110
I have come to inform you that your
ten years here as ambassador...

458
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:08,360
...have been well
appreciated by her majesty.

459
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:12,170
would like to celebrate
the new century...

460
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:13,840
...by raising you...

461
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:15,830
...to the highest rank...

462
00:49:15,930 --> 00:49:16,920
...in the...

463
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:18,390
...peerage.

464
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:20,490
Ahh.

465
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:22,810
There must be a party.

466
00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:25,730
well of course one must demonstrate
the gravity of an investiture,

467
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:30,020
A large party, food
and entertainment.

468
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:33,380
But of course you know
that they call customs

469
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:41,160
Exactly who you should invite,
to the ball. Who's who.

470
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:30,250
Strange.

471
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,810
Most strange.

472
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:37,890
Perhaps they don't hold
punctuality in high regard?

473
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:13,050
As a representative of
her majesty Queen Anne.

474
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:14,950
I am pleased...

475
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:17,050
...and honoured...

476
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:21,050
...to bestow the most
noble Order of the Bath...

477
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:23,680
...upon this...

478
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:26,290
...loyal servant...

479
00:51:32,970 --> 00:51:36,740
...for ambassadorial
services rendered...

480
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:38,490
...to the Crown...

481
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:39,970
...and...

482
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:43,020
...for the glory of god.

483
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:08,288
I'm sorry to arrive in this
fashion but we must talk.

484
00:52:08,388 --> 00:52:10,388
But this is outrageous.

485
00:52:11,850 --> 00:52:14,284
I was expecting you as a
guest at my party, I...

486
00:52:14,384 --> 00:52:16,870
...didn't realize you were
entertaining hostilities.

487
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:20,820
I was warned that Englishman
would be dangerous for me.

488
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:23,820
I would like to give you an
opportunity to prove this wrong.

489
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:27,610
Then let me introduce you, this is
the archduke Harry from England.

490
00:52:27,710 --> 00:52:29,710
Delighted.

491
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,140
Orlando.

492
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,550
Our enemies are at the city wall.

493
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:38,680
Will you help?

494
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:43,280
You wish me to take arms?

495
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:46,620
Truly Orlando you an
Englishman are not afraid?

496
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:48,660
Sir.

497
00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:51,610
My Lord.

498
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:56,040
Despite these appalling manners...

499
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:59,710
...we must keep our interests
alive in this region.

500
00:53:00,370 --> 00:53:02,520
What do you recommend.

501
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:09,640
- Harry, distribute your arms.
- But these fellows?

502
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:12,150
- Do as I say.
- But sir.

503
00:53:34,190 --> 00:53:36,190
Follow me.

504
00:53:41,490 --> 00:53:43,490
Brother.

505
00:54:15,490 --> 00:54:17,490
Leave him.

506
00:54:18,290 --> 00:54:19,620
Leave him.

507
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:22,090
This is a dying man.

508
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:25,010
He's not a man, he's the enemy.

509
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:25,270
Same person.

510
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:28,050
No difference at all.

511
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:35,290
Just a different sex.

512
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:54,420
Well, here I am again.

513
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:30,880
Some more invitations my lady.

514
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:38,760
Is not this the lady famed
for her literary gatherings?

515
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:43,760
Yes ma'am, but you could not
possibly venture there. Alone.

516
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:44,900
Why ever not?

517
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:51,080
Society ma'am is full of dangerous
individuals, which and... poets.

518
01:00:55,440 --> 01:01:03,840
¶ Where you walk, call gale
shall find the glade. ¶

519
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:07,290
And how is your leg now Mr Swift?

520
01:01:07,290 --> 01:01:10,178
I have to tell you that
the gout have left...

521
01:01:10,278 --> 01:01:12,840
...my left leg and is
travelled to my right.

522
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:15,420
Aah, the conversation is of legs.

523
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:16,720
Gout Mr Pope.

524
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:18,870
You are an expert in this field?

525
01:01:18,970 --> 01:01:21,910
I believe I can say I
have some knowledge.

526
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:24,380
A little learning is
a dangerous thing.

527
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:29,490
Mr Pope, I must write
that down at once.

528
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:32,030
I already have madam.

529
01:01:32,030 --> 01:01:36,660
If taken as a science the study of
ailments can be quite fascinating.

530
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:40,790
Indeed I believe science to
be interesting than poetry.

531
01:01:44,890 --> 01:01:46,890
Do you?

532
01:01:48,010 --> 01:01:50,620
Appraise sir, Elaborate.

533
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:59,080
We.. well the systematic
study, exploration...

534
01:01:59,130 --> 01:02:02,960
...and taming of the
material world...

535
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:07,500
...is surely a proper
occupation for a man.

536
01:02:08,380 --> 01:02:10,110
Compared to which...

537
01:02:10,210 --> 01:02:14,390
...the introvert
art of scribbling...

538
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:30,210
...wishfully...

539
01:02:30,210 --> 01:02:33,930
...the occupation of...of...

540
01:02:33,930 --> 01:02:35,930
...a fool?

541
01:02:37,430 --> 01:02:41,180
So I admit a general rule
that every poet is a fool.

542
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:44,230
But you yourself may
server to show it.

543
01:02:44,350 --> 01:02:47,280
That every fool is not a poet.

544
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:52,360
Mr Pope, you're
pleased to be witty.

545
01:03:13,690 --> 01:03:19,030
They are all words and
no breeding archduke.

546
01:03:19,130 --> 01:03:22,120
- But so amusing.
- Countess, forgive me.

547
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:23,520
But the young lady
who has joined us...

548
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:26,268
...bears the extraordinary
resemblance to...

549
01:03:26,368 --> 01:03:27,360
The Lady Orlando.

550
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:29,480
Orlando.

551
01:03:31,990 --> 01:03:34,610
I were so proud of you Harry.

552
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:36,610
The Order of the Bath.

553
01:03:36,610 --> 01:03:40,510
Marvellous. Cream?

554
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:14,757
Well how pleasant it
is I'd live to sip...

555
01:04:14,857 --> 01:04:16,930
...tea in the presence
of a gracious lady.

556
01:04:17,030 --> 01:04:18,520
Do you Pestradus.

557
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:22,585
As our good friend Dr
Johnson says Every...

558
01:04:22,685 --> 01:04:25,920
...man is or desires
to be an... idler.

559
01:04:27,070 --> 01:04:30,130
Perhaps not every woman Mr Swift.

560
01:04:30,970 --> 01:04:34,840
Women have no desires,
only affectation.

561
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:37,720
Indeed women are but
children of larger growth.

562
01:04:37,820 --> 01:04:41,170
Aah, but I consider woman to be
a beautiful romantic animal.

563
01:04:41,270 --> 01:04:43,010
Who should be adorned in...

564
01:04:43,110 --> 01:04:46,210
Furs and feathers,
pearls and diamonds.

565
01:04:46,210 --> 01:04:47,810
Apart from my wife of course.

566
01:04:47,910 --> 01:04:50,520
Will insist upon
attempting to learn Greek.

567
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:53,022
It's so very unbecoming I
can hardly tolerate her...

568
01:04:53,122 --> 01:04:55,430
...company at the breakfast
table. Why do they do it?

569
01:04:55,530 --> 01:04:59,590
Oh, every woman is adverse to
contradiction and frankly...

570
01:04:59,810 --> 01:05:02,610
...most women have no
characters at all.

571
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:05,680
Present company accepted of course.

572
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:11,560
Oh, the lady is aflame.

573
01:05:12,530 --> 01:05:14,530
And silent.

574
01:05:16,910 --> 01:05:18,910
Perfect.

575
01:05:22,950 --> 01:05:24,690
Gentlemen.

576
01:05:24,790 --> 01:05:26,840
I find it strange.

577
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:31,560
You are poets, each one of you and
speak of your muse in the feminine.

578
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:34,280
And yet you appear to feel
neither tenderness...

579
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:38,520
...nor respect towards your wives
nor towards females in general.

580
01:05:38,620 --> 01:05:42,063
Madam. I have only
the highest regard...

581
01:05:42,163 --> 01:05:44,820
...and purest respect for females.

582
01:05:45,190 --> 01:05:48,440
I find no evidence of that
sentiment in your conversation.

583
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:52,740
Conversation is a place where
plays with ideas my dear lady.

584
01:05:52,830 --> 01:05:55,120
The one forges them quite alone.

585
01:05:55,170 --> 01:05:57,360
- Quite so.
- Quite. Quite.

586
01:05:57,650 --> 01:06:00,170
The intellect is a solitary place.

587
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:04,115
And therefore quite unsuitable a
terrain for females who must...

588
01:06:04,215 --> 01:06:06,153
...discover their
natures through...

589
01:06:06,253 --> 01:06:08,190
...the guidance of
a father or husband.

590
01:06:08,290 --> 01:06:10,570
And if she has neither?

591
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:12,560
Then...

592
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:15,510
However charming she
may be dear lady...

593
01:06:17,210 --> 01:06:19,210
She is lost.

594
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:29,560
None of us knew what had happened.

595
01:06:29,950 --> 01:06:31,520
It is extraordinary.

596
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:35,670
And to think we could have
been so charmingly misled.

597
01:06:53,970 --> 01:06:57,930
Dear Lady. Orlando.

598
01:07:02,770 --> 01:07:04,770
The same.

599
01:07:04,930 --> 01:07:07,610
We wish to inform you.

600
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:10,700
Madam.

601
01:07:11,010 --> 01:07:14,039
That you are a party to several
major lawsuits that have...

602
01:07:14,139 --> 01:07:16,750
...been preferred against
you concerning the property.

603
01:07:16,850 --> 01:07:19,070
The family seat.

604
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:21,700
Pray continue.

605
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:23,800
Erh heh.

606
01:07:25,030 --> 01:07:28,082
One: You are legally
dead and therefore...

607
01:07:28,182 --> 01:07:30,842
...cannot hold any
property whatsoever.

608
01:07:30,870 --> 01:07:32,870
Ah.

609
01:07:33,010 --> 01:07:34,020
Fine.

610
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:36,540
Two: You are now female.

611
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:40,090
Which amounts much the same thing.

612
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:43,230
Pending the legal
judgment however..

613
01:07:43,330 --> 01:07:47,320
You have the laws permission
to reside in the property...

614
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:53,110
- ...in a state of incognito.
- Or incognita as the case may be.

615
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:55,720
Harry.

616
01:07:55,820 --> 01:07:58,980
There is only one solution
in your current predicament.

617
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:00,450
Indeed.

618
01:08:00,550 --> 01:08:04,570
I can offer you a house
to rival your own.

619
01:08:05,710 --> 01:08:07,420
I don't quite understand.

620
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:09,080
I confess.

621
01:08:09,180 --> 01:08:14,110
Orlando, to me you were and always
will be, weather male or female...

622
01:08:14,180 --> 01:08:18,740
The pink the pearl and the
perfection of yourself?

623
01:08:23,410 --> 01:08:26,000
I'm offering you my hand.

624
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:30,480
Oh. Archduke.

625
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:33,810
That is very kind of you, yes.

626
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:35,860
I can't accept.

627
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:38,500
But I...

628
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:41,230
I, am England.

629
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:44,330
And you are mine.

630
01:08:44,410 --> 01:08:46,220
I see.

631
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:48,320
On what grounds?

632
01:08:49,110 --> 01:08:51,180
That I adore you.

633
01:08:51,750 --> 01:08:54,920
And this means that
I belong to you?

634
01:08:55,470 --> 01:08:58,690
- Are you refusing me?
- I am, I'm sorry.

635
01:08:59,110 --> 01:09:01,400
But Orlando.

636
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:05,120
With your history quite
frankly who else will have you?

637
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:07,610
Do you realize what
you're turning down?

638
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:13,320
With your ambiguous sexuality
which I am prepared to tolerate.

639
01:09:14,110 --> 01:09:17,560
This is your last chance
of respectability.

640
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:19,020
Can't breathe.

641
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:23,400
You will die a spinster,
dispossessed and alone.

642
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:36,780
Spinster.

643
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:42,280
Alone.

644
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:49,650
Nature, nature, I'm
your bride. Take me.

645
01:11:28,470 --> 01:11:30,260
You're hurt ma'am?

646
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:32,360
I'm dead, sir.

647
01:11:32,660 --> 01:11:35,530
Dead. That's serious. Can I help?

648
01:11:36,570 --> 01:11:38,570
Will you marry me?

649
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:45,460
Ma'am... I would gladly... um, I...
but I fear my ankle is twisted.

650
01:12:00,570 --> 01:12:02,210
What's that?

651
01:12:02,310 --> 01:12:04,310
The future.

652
01:12:28,990 --> 01:12:33,100
Some milk? My god I don't
yet know your name, sir.

653
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:37,240
How strange, I feel as though
I know everything about you.

654
01:12:37,250 --> 01:12:40,640
When like meets like.
My name is Shelmerdine.

655
01:12:40,690 --> 01:12:42,170
Orlando.

656
01:12:42,270 --> 01:12:46,470
So.. it only remains to fill in
such unimportant details as..

657
01:12:46,510 --> 01:12:48,620
What we do and so on.

658
01:12:48,940 --> 01:12:51,600
Well you can see for
yourself what I was.

659
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:53,700
Was?

660
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:25,060
You see, I'm about
to lose everything.

661
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:30,350
Then you can come with me.

662
01:13:32,380 --> 01:13:34,380
Where are you going?

663
01:13:34,890 --> 01:13:36,910
Back to America?

664
01:13:37,210 --> 01:13:40,010
When the wind changes
to the south-west.

665
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,290
America.

666
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:48,560
I've been abroad.

667
01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:50,550
But east.

668
01:13:50,650 --> 01:13:54,360
Then you know as well as I,
how good it is to travel.

669
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:57,970
Like a free spirit.

670
01:13:58,070 --> 01:14:00,970
Unfettered by position
or possession.

671
01:14:05,780 --> 01:14:07,780
Unfettered.

672
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:11,120
Are you...

673
01:14:11,220 --> 01:14:14,520
An adventurer by profession?

674
01:14:17,610 --> 01:14:21,420
My profession, if you
can call it that...

675
01:14:21,550 --> 01:14:23,720
...it's the pursuit of liberty.

676
01:14:25,950 --> 01:14:30,460
The bright shade, of
some immortal dream.

677
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:34,750
Which walks when tempus sleeps.

678
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:38,500
The wave of life's dark stream.

679
01:14:39,660 --> 01:14:42,410
You don't really want a husband.

680
01:14:43,170 --> 01:14:46,750
I suppose your journey is
to be hazardous at times.

681
01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:49,820
Think, you want a lover.

682
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:52,490
You've fought in battles?

683
01:14:52,590 --> 01:14:54,900
Like a man?

684
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:57,170
I have fought.

685
01:14:57,590 --> 01:14:59,360
Blood?

686
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:01,600
If necessary, yes.

687
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:05,610
Freedom must be taken,
if it must be won.

688
01:15:08,260 --> 01:15:10,570
If I were a man...

689
01:15:10,860 --> 01:15:12,860
You?

690
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:19,540
I might choose not to risk my
life for an uncertain cause.

691
01:15:20,230 --> 01:15:25,060
I might think that freedom won
by death is not worth having.

692
01:15:26,970 --> 01:15:28,180
In fact...

693
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:32,770
You might choose not to
be a real man at all.

694
01:15:35,850 --> 01:15:37,930
Say, if I were a woman...

695
01:15:39,420 --> 01:15:41,420
You?

696
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:47,100
I might choose not to sacrifice
my life caring for my children,

697
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:50,150
nor my children's children,

698
01:15:50,350 --> 01:15:54,740
nor to drown anonymously in
the milk of female kindness,

699
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:59,980
but instead, say, to go abroad.

700
01:16:01,510 --> 01:16:03,730
Would I then be...

701
01:16:06,050 --> 01:16:09,550
A real woman?

702
01:16:29,060 --> 01:16:36,000
I think I'm going to faint. I've
never felt better in my life.

703
01:19:17,870 --> 01:19:22,010
Rise, from pains of thee.

704
01:19:23,170 --> 01:19:27,200
From first sweet sleep of night.

705
01:19:27,970 --> 01:19:31,590
Winds are breathing low.

706
01:19:31,940 --> 01:19:35,910
Heavens stars are shining bright.

707
01:19:46,230 --> 01:19:49,650
But it is day.

708
01:19:51,050 --> 01:19:54,480
Days are nice.

709
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:59,130
Mingling are sweet embrace on end.

710
01:20:07,530 --> 01:20:08,610
Who's there?

711
01:20:08,710 --> 01:20:11,547
Excuse me my lady, there
are two officers...

712
01:20:11,647 --> 01:20:14,090
...outside with a
warrant from the queen.

713
01:20:14,190 --> 01:20:15,740
The queen?

714
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:20,610
Victoria, ma'am. The gentlemen say
they must speak to you in person.

715
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:24,880
Oh.

716
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:28,010
I'd almost forgotten.

717
01:20:33,350 --> 01:20:35,940
Her ladyship.

718
01:20:37,710 --> 01:20:40,020
The lawsuit is settled.

719
01:20:40,180 --> 01:20:43,366
My sex is pronounced
indisputably and...

720
01:20:43,466 --> 01:20:46,410
...beyond shadow of
a doubt... female...

721
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:50,310
Therefore heirs made of my
body will risk it taking...

722
01:20:50,355 --> 01:20:53,855
...as red. I lose everything
unless I have a son.

723
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:03,040
So you're free.

724
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:08,030
I think the spirit of this century
is finally taken me and broken me.

725
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:10,690
I would be sad if it were true.

726
01:21:11,170 --> 01:21:12,880
But it is not.

727
01:21:12,980 --> 01:21:14,860
Come with me.

728
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:17,080
I cannot.

729
01:21:17,390 --> 01:21:19,260
I can't just follow you.

730
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:22,229
You can stay and stagnate
in the past or leave...

731
01:21:22,329 --> 01:21:24,960
...and live for the future,
the choice is yours.

732
01:21:25,060 --> 01:21:27,545
As a man one has
choices, Shelmerdine.

733
01:21:27,645 --> 01:21:30,130
Orlando, you can do
whatever you want.

734
01:21:30,230 --> 01:21:32,520
Would you like to
have a child with me?

735
01:21:32,620 --> 01:21:34,740
So that you can keep your house?

736
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:39,190
No, not for the house
Shelmerdine. Perhaps for love?

737
01:21:39,470 --> 01:21:42,480
These are the times
that try men's souls.

738
01:21:42,570 --> 01:21:45,630
My love is for mankind,
I must fight for liberty.

739
01:21:45,730 --> 01:21:49,100
- I must fight for a future.
- For a future?

740
01:21:49,230 --> 01:21:54,500
This future of yours Shelmerdine,
when it's gonna begin... today?

741
01:21:54,550 --> 01:21:57,010
or is it always tomorrow?

742
01:21:57,300 --> 01:22:00,450
Touché Orlando.

743
01:22:07,570 --> 01:22:10,610
The wind.

744
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,360
The wind.

745
01:22:13,540 --> 01:22:16,540
The south-west wind.

746
01:22:43,450 --> 01:22:47,780
Good bye, Shelmerdine. Good luck.

747
01:22:48,030 --> 01:22:50,100
Orlando.

748
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:51,710
It's really very good.

749
01:24:52,580 --> 01:24:56,470
Written from the heart.

750
01:24:57,630 --> 01:25:00,110
I think it'll sell.

751
01:25:00,870 --> 01:25:03,810
Provided you rewrite it. You know.

752
01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:08,050
Increase the love interest.
Give it a happy ending.

753
01:25:08,580 --> 01:25:12,870
By the way, how long
did this draft take you?

754
01:26:51,340 --> 01:26:53,180
Come on. Come on.

755
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:55,160
She.

756
01:26:55,260 --> 01:26:58,670
For there can be no
doubt about her sex.

757
01:26:58,820 --> 01:27:02,134
Is visiting the house
she finally lost for...

758
01:27:02,234 --> 01:27:05,174
...the first time in
over a hundred years.

759
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:09,560
She does still have certain
natural advantages of course.

760
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:13,376
She is tall and slim, with
a slightly androgynous...

761
01:27:13,476 --> 01:27:17,186
...appearance that many
females at the time aspire to.

762
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:19,820
Then her upbringing,

763
01:27:19,820 --> 01:27:25,080
she's lived for four hundred
years and hardly aged a day.

764
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:27,570
And because this is England.

765
01:27:27,620 --> 01:27:31,070
Everyone pretends not to notice.

766
01:27:31,660 --> 01:27:34,470
But she has changed.

767
01:27:34,770 --> 01:27:38,430
She is no longer
trapped by destiny.

768
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:43,310
And... ever since she
let go of the past...

769
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:47,230
She found her life was beginning.

770
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:20,440
¶ I am coming. I am coming. ¶...

771
01:28:20,460 --> 01:28:22,550
...¶ I am coming through. ¶...

772
01:28:22,650 --> 01:28:26,990
...¶ Coming across
the divide to you ¶...

773
01:28:28,290 --> 01:28:31,300
...¶ In this moment
of unity ¶...

774
01:28:31,420 --> 01:28:33,710
...¶ feeling an ecstasy ¶...

775
01:28:33,710 --> 01:28:36,320
...¶ to be here, to be now ¶...

776
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:39,080
...¶ At last I am free ¶

777
01:28:45,890 --> 01:28:48,220
Why are you sad?

778
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:51,330
I'm not. I'm happy.

779
01:28:51,430 --> 01:28:54,260
Look. Look up there.

780
01:28:54,310 --> 01:28:56,940
¶ Yes at last, at last ¶...

781
01:28:56,940 --> 01:28:59,320
...¶ to be free of the past ¶...

782
01:28:59,340 --> 01:29:04,660
...¶ and of the future
that beckons me ¶...

783
01:29:04,810 --> 01:29:07,730
...¶ I am coming.
I am coming. ¶...

784
01:29:07,730 --> 01:29:09,610
...¶ Here I am. ¶...

785
01:29:09,710 --> 01:29:14,860
...¶ Neither a woman,
nor a man ¶...

786
01:29:15,270 --> 01:29:17,790
...¶ We are joined,
we are one ¶...

787
01:29:17,860 --> 01:29:20,490
...¶ With the human face ¶...

788
01:29:20,490 --> 01:29:23,010
...¶ We are joined,
we are one ¶...

789
01:29:23,060 --> 01:29:25,400
...¶ With the human face ¶...

790
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:27,220
...¶ I am on earth ¶...

791
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:30,520
...¶ And I am in
outer space ¶...

792
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:35,750
...¶ I'm being born
and I am dying ¶...

793
01:29:35,750 --> 01:29:37,790
...¶ I am on earth ¶...

794
01:29:37,790 --> 01:29:41,020
...¶ And I am in
outer space ¶...

795
01:29:41,020 --> 01:29:46,680
...¶ I'm being born

796
01:30:17,970 --> 01:30:20,630
...¶ I am coming.
I am coming. ¶...

797
01:30:20,630 --> 01:30:22,620
...¶ I am coming through. ¶...

798
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:27,700

the divide to you ¶...

799

803
01:30:49,230 --> 01:30:51,810
...¶ Yes at last, at last ¶...

804
01:30:51,810 --> 01:30:54,030
...¶ to be free of the past ¶...

805

...¶ and of the future
that beckons me ¶...

806
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:02,230

...¶ with the human face ¶...

814

...¶ Oh we are joined,

01:31:51,010 --> 01:31:57,000
