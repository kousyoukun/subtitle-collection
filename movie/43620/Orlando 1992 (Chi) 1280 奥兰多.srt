2
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,260
A see the virgin rose.

3
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:25,110
How sweetly she doth first
peep forth with bashful modesty.

4
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,010
That fair her seems...

5
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,630
That fair her seems
the less ye see her may.

6
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,860
Lo see soon after how...

7
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:44,469
Modesty.

8
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,220
There are things that she'll see!

9
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:51,340
Lo see soon after how... more
bold and free her bared bosom...

10
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:03,710
A see the virgin rose... How sweetly
she doth peep forth with bashful modesty.

11
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,740
<i>There can be no doubt about his sex.</i>

12
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:12,080
<i>Despite the feminine appearance that
every young man at the time aspires to.</i>

13
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:15,540
<i>And there can be no doubt
about his upbringing.</i>

14
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,020
<i>Good food.</i>

15
00:01:17,021 --> 00:01:18,349
<i>Education.</i>

16
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,360
<i>A nanny.</i>

17
00:01:19,361 --> 00:01:21,970
<i>Loneliness and isolation.</i>

18
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,930
<i>And... because this is England...</i>

19
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:30,660
<i>Orlando would therefore seem destined
to have his portrait on the wall.</i>

20
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,010
<i>And his name in the history books.</i>

21
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,200
<i>But when he...</i>

22
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:37,859
That is...

23
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,329
I...

24
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:41,580
<i>came into the world.</i>

25
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,260
<i>He was looking for something else.</i>

26
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,710
<i>Though heir to a name that
meant power, land and property...</i>

27
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,880
<i>Surely when Orlando was born...</i>

28
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,470
<i>it wasn't privilege he sought...</i>

29
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,960
<i>but company.</i>

30
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,150
<i>♫ Eliza ♫</i>

<i>♫ Eliza's eyes are blessed stars, ♫</i>

DEATH

58
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,920
More wine my lord?

59
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,579
A see the virgin rose.

60
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,479
How sweetly she doth first peep forth

61
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,660
With bashful modesty.

62
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:01,380
That fair her seems
the less ye see her may.

63
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,309
Lo see soon after how..

64
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:09,310
more bold and free her bared
bosom she doth broad display

65
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:13,180
Lo see soon after how she fades...

66
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,439
and falls away.

67
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,440
so passeth in th..

68
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,140
Is this a worthy topic?

69
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:24,830
From one so clearly
in the bloom of youth.

70
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,130
To one who would desire it still?

71
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:32,609
Fair virgo gratious majesty,

72
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:36,249
Your bloom is legendary,

73
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:40,129
and these were of course not
the sentiments of our son,

74
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:42,130
but of a poet.

75
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,290
Now what would please you?

76
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:49,860
All that is mine is
here for your pleasure.

77
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:54,380
All you call yours is mine already.

78
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,600
Come.

79
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:34,290
Your leg.

80
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:52,200
I want you here in England with me.

81
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:55,879
You will be the son of my old age

82
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,100
and the limb of my infirmity.

83
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,440
My favorite.

84
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,640
My mascot.

85
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:14,920
Come.

86
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,790
Aah, this is my victory.

87
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:50,220
Come, your handsome leg.

88
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:08,410
For you and for your heirs Orlando.

89
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,300
The house.

90
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,920
Your Majesty.

91
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,399
I'm forever i...

92
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,860
But on one condition.

93
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,720
Do not fade.

94
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,980
Do not wither.

95
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:28,180
Do not grow old.

96
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,570
Very interesting person.

97
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:41,320
First the queen and now his father.

98
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,540
It is too sad.

99
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,950
Mourning so becomes him.

100
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,769
One can quite see why
he was the favorite.

101
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:50,880
My dear friends how can you?

102
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,230
In his time of grief.

103
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:34,070
LOVE

104
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,360
That way.

105
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,350
Sasha!

106
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,470
Who's that?

107
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,500
I believe she is the daughter
of the muscovite ambassador.

108
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,670
How the delightful.

109
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,730
If that's to your taste.

110
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,170
What ever can you mean?

111
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:06,660
Oh, smearing themselves
with candle wax to keep warm.

112
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:09,770
Wearing beards as they get
older, that kind of thing.

113
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:12,399
Perhaps in this you're mistaken, Moray.

114
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,800
Told me on good authority
by Lord Francis Vere.

115
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,220
Does he travel to muscovite.

116
00:15:16,221 --> 00:15:17,970
He knows someone who did.

117
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,360
Aah.

118
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,270
This is the Lady Euphrosyne.

119
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,530
The Lord Winchelsea.

120
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,900
The Lord Orlando.

121
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,170
The Earl of Moray.

122
00:16:05,171 --> 00:16:07,170
Moray....

123
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:10,470
And I am Lord Lord Francis Vere.

124
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,200
Ochin Liesna.

125
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:14,200
- Sorry?
- Enchanté.

126
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,670
- Enchanted.
- Aah.

127
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:22,490
And my name is Alexandra Menchikova.

128
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:25,030
But my father calls me Sasha.

129
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:27,980
Enchanté.

130
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,449
Here doing some quail.

131
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:31,870
Spasiba.

132
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:34,020
Do they have quail in Russia?

133
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,330
Do you speak French?

134
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:38,010
A little.

135
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:44,730
But the most Englishmen can't, or
do not want to speak other languages.

136
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:48,400
How do they communicate
with strangers then?

137
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:51,260
They speak English louder.

138
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:54,289
Please tell the ambassador that this,

139
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:59,220
great frost is the most severe
ever to have visited these islands.

140
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:06,740
Erh, tell him that in Norfolk a young country
woman was seen to turn visibly to powder

141
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:11,540
and was blown away in a puff
of dust in the icy blast.

142
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,220
Most amusing.

143
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:20,090
Don't worry my dear, this absurd
affection will not last the season.

144
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,890
After all..

145
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:23,890
She's a foreigner.

146
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:15,280
My Lord Orlando, you're in
danger of becoming a fool.

147
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:19,340
You're ruining what could be the
finest career in the land and for what?

148
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:22,170
I no longer care for a career, Moray.

149
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,390
I'm only interested in love.

150
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:30,329
Don't you see in courting a Cossack,
you're humiliating not only your fiancé

151
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:33,410
but the entire female
population of this country.

152
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,700
Besides which, they have nothing.

153
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,190
Why do you think they're here?

154
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:24,669
For your sake I would hunt wolf instead of
rabbit drinking vodka instead of whiskey.

155
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:25,749
How generous.

156
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:29,969
As for marriage to the good Lady Euphrosyne the thing
is so probably absurd that I scarcely give it a thought.

157
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,049
How gallant.

158
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:36,070
I feel as if I've been hooked through the nose and rushed
through the waters painfully yet with my own consent.

159
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,070
How brave.

160
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:47,130
My Lord, have you quite
forgotten that we are betrothed?

161
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,840
My Lady, I'm being constantly reminded.

162
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,990
You speak so lightly of it.

163
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,790
You've betrayed me.

164
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:57,390
The treachery of men.

165
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,600
It would never have worked.

166
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:09,230
A man must follow his heart.

167
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:00,330
There.

168
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,520
Where you live?

169
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:04,190
I do.

170
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:06,700
By yourself?

171
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,740
Well, yes.

172
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,540
At the moment.

173
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,030
No brother?

174
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:22,540
No sister?

175
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,490
You Sasha?

176
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,460
If I had brother I wouldn't be here.

177
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,200
My father only has me.

178
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:20,390
Nothing thicker than a knifes blade
separates melancholy from happiness.

179
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:23,040
Why are you sad?

180
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,290
Because.

181
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,190
Because I can't bear
this happiness to end.

182
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,740
But we are together.

183
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,380
Yes, now.

184
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:39,450
But what about tomorrow?

185
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:41,450
And the day after?

186
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:44,520
Orlando.

187
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:47,130
I think you suffer from
a strange melancholy.

188
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:49,870
Which is, you suffer in advance.

189
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,670
Look at me. Look.

190
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:01,350
You are too serious, Orlando.

191
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,970
And yet not serious enough.

192
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:11,409
- Shadows, you saw shadows.
- You were in his arms!

193
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:14,369
- It was illusion in light.
- Then what were you doing?

194
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:17,669
- He was taking me across deck.
- But I saw you!

195
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:22,320
May gods destroy me, if I family
Menchikov would lie in arm of sailor.

196
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,490
Sasha.

197
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:29,940
I can not think of a life without you.

198
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:31,940
Stay with me.

199
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:35,090
- Don't ever go.
- But it's impossible.

200
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:37,229
But why?

201
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:39,399
Because when ice breaks we must go.

202
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,740
But we're linked.

203
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:44,920
Our destinies are linked.

204
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:48,260
You're mine!

205
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,600
Why?

206
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:53,170
Because I adore you.

207
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,790
Meet me at midnight at London bridge.

208
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:00,230
We'll fly away as free as birds.

209
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:03,660
Lot's of air, very fresh.

210
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,340
There.

211
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:09,500
It's decided.

212
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:18,759
your lessons, speak now his
now his a lot with peace within

213
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,760
Speak of me as I am.

214
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:26,270
Nothing extenuates nor
sits down aught in malice.

215
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,889
Then speak of one.

216
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:36,589
Who loved lord wisely but to well

217
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:40,069
But one whom not easily jealous

218
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:43,050
But being wrought,
perplexed in the extreme

219
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:47,090
Of one whose hand, like the base Indian

220
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:49,300
threw a pearl away.

221
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,660
worth more than all his tribe.

222
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:00,020
I kissed thee ear. I killed thee.

223
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,270
No way but this.

224
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,870
By killing myself...

225
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:08,380
To die upon a kiss.

226
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:14,290
Terrific play.

227
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:58,080
She will. She will be here.

228
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,130
Help! Help!

229
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:35,390
The treachery of women.

230
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,590
Ehm, ehm.

231
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:55,620
Ehm!

232
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,280
Good morning!

233
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,050
It's now time to awake!

234
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:26,290
To such a fine morning.

235
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:32,880
From such a long refreshing sleep.

236
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:40,940
- Six days you say?
- Tomorrow will be the seventh.

237
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:55,100
<i>♫ This pleasing shining wondrous day. ♫</i>

238
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:12,519
The Lord Orlando...

239
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,520
is sleeping.

240
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:27,950
I can find only three words
to describe the female sex.

241
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,090
None of which are worth expressing.

242
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:41,789
POETRY

243
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:46,290
When in disgrace with
fortune and men's eyes.

244
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:51,220
I all alone beweep my outcast state.

245
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,740
and trouble heaven

246
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,530
with my bootless cries.

247
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:01,400
and look upon myself

248
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:04,450
and curse my fate.

249
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:12,920
Aah.

250
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,440
Poetry.

251
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:38,820
Get off!

252
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:40,820
Get off!

253
00:32:40,821 --> 00:32:42,460
Off! Off!

254
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,610
Thank you.

255
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:09,070
I was thinking.

256
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,430
Sitting here, as we are.

257
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:19,540
It's odd. Considering how
common the name of Greene is,

258
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:22,319
that the Greene family came
over with the conquerer.

259
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,320
And is in fact,

260
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,890
from the highest nobility in France.
- Oh.

261
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,230
Oh, really?

262
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:37,280
Unfortunately the Greens came
down in the world and erm..

263
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:41,140
We've little more than leave our
name to the burrower of Greenwich.

264
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:47,099
And now Mr. Greene to the subject
closer to my heart and yours.

265
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,339
The sacred subject of poetry.

266
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,310
Aah.

267
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:57,420
You know, I once broke a lady's
fan in my enthusiasm to find a rime.

268
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:00,080
Enthusiasm can be dangerous.

269
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:04,930
As a youth I was often mocked for
my love of poetry and solitude.

270
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:06,930
Tragic.

271
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:13,409
And of course Mr. Greene, your works
hold pride of place in my library.

272
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:14,350
Uh-uh.

273
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:19,149
To me there is a certain glory
about a man who can express in words

274
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:23,270
those great emotions
that others can only feel.

275
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:25,880
Oh.

276
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:30,279
You know I scarcely dared to
ask to make your acquaintance

277
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:33,610
for I feel that I can
offer nothing in return.

278
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,990
I'm sure that any writer would be more
than willing to except your hospitality.

279
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:39,790
Oh, do you think so?

280
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:42,430
If we would speak of poetry...

281
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:45,960
then let us first speak of poets lives.

282
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,800
Do you know how "Hamlet" was written?

283
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,510
Written while bailiffs were
pounding on Shakespeare's door.

284
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:54,680
No wonder so many of his
plays were falsey too.

285
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,680
Aw, I'm sure you're right.

286
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:00,800
How can a... How can a genius
work when he cannot pay the bills?

287
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,420
When I say work...

288
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,400
Erm, work you see... is...

289
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,610
people who haven't labored
in this way don't understand

290
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:13,710
that real poetry neither
easy nor easily produced.

291
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:16,799
Then I feel that I can
understand a little Mr. Greene.

292
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:21,420
Because I have myself been so righteous
to attempt to write some poems...

293
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,760
Did I hear a mouse's squeak?

294
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:28,550
I must say I didn't hear any.

295
00:35:28,551 --> 00:35:30,790
That's saying you're in good health.

296
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:35,450
My own my lord have been so bad
it's a marvel I'm still alive.

297
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:40,020
I have an enlarged heart, a
spleen and a diseased liver.

298
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:46,030
Above all there are sensations in
my spine which defy description.

299
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:49,860
There is one nob about a third
from the top which burns like fire.

300
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:53,580
Second from the bottom... cold as ice.

301
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:58,230
Sometimes I feel as if a
thousand wax tapers were a lite.

302
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:02,410
And people were throwing
fireworks inside my brain and I...

303
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:04,410
I'm so sensitive.

304
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:07,890
I can feel a rose leaf
through my mattress.

305
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,220
In short.

306
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:13,599
I'm a piece of machinery so finely made

307
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,330
and curiously put together

308
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:18,580
that it confounds me to think

309
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:22,020
That I've only sold
115 copies of my poem.

310
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:26,440
But it has to be said this is largely due to what
can only be descried as a conspiracy against me.

311
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:31,260
But Mr. Greene surely your work is
widely admired by all the young poets?

312
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:35,850
- Including dare I say it...
- All young writers will turn at any trash that will sell.

313
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:38,340
It hurts me to say it.

314
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:41,730
For I love literature, as I love life.

315
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:45,620
But the art of poetry
is dead in England.

316
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,620
You think so?

317
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:51,620
Of course... erhm...

318
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,130
That I have pension...

319
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,900
of...

320
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:57,900
300 pounds a year?

321
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,810
paid...

322
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,680
quarterly...

323
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,680
I'd live for literature alone..

324
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:06,270
I'd dedicate myself to fine writing.

325
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:10,229
But... sadly...

326
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:13,610
It's necessary to have
a pension to do it.

327
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:16,470
About 300 pounds a year.

328
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:20,480
Paid quarterly.

329
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:25,849
Mr. Greene, I wounder would you be so kind
as to give me your opinion of my efforts?

330
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:29,250
By all means... If I can find the time.

331
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,540
For time is money.

332
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:33,760
And I must write to eat.

333
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:38,660
- We're not in the pursuit of art.
- Of course I will arrange for the small matter of the 300 pounds.

334
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,549
To be paid...

335
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,530
Quarterly?

336
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,560
- As you wish.
- My dear friend!

337
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:50,290
"Death of a lover".

338
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:04,780
Listen to this my friend.
This is the great work

339
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:10,780
Of my gracious host, the soon to be,
congratulate me friend, my pension

340
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,100
"His heart was broken"

341
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:15,290
"cleft in two"

342
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:18,350
"abandoned, lost"

343
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:20,350
"what could he do?"

344
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:24,140
"And into this he retched cried"

345
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,140
"She said she loved me"

346
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,140
"But she lied"

347
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:31,250
"And so betrayed"

348
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:34,360
"He fell and died".

349
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:49,860
Try as he might.

350
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:53,790
This gracious noble lord.

351
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:56,510
Who lifts his pen.

352
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:58,870
And thinks he then can write.

353
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:03,330
Can not, for who can pen.

354
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:06,040
When he is bored.

355
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:12,080
The mind of leisure only can be trite.

356
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:16,950
This pretty knight who
feebly lifts his sword

357
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:20,740
To make a witless
thrust against his doom.

358
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:24,090
Is foiled by what his
noble birth affords

359
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:28,380
Dogs, dogs more dogs
and far to many rooms.

360
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:33,140
So fortune smiles on
those that own the land

361
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:37,800
And frowns at the trivia
from the dabblers hand.

362
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:49,890
I would like you to drop this in
the midst of the filthiest manure.

363
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,110
And Mr. Greene's pension, sir?

364
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:55,140
Pay it, quarterly.

365
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,370
Abroad?

366
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:10,490
As your ambassador, your majesty.

367
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,230
Ambassador?

368
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:16,740
I see, once the balance of power
has been established here in Europe.

369
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:21,000
We must certainly turn
our attention to the east.

370
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,000
Well Orlando.

371
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:31,130
I fear you will be quite starved of conversation
and amusement in such a remote corner of the world.

372
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:36,890
However, I believe they
have an interest in...

373
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,890
horticulture.

374
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:45,210
I'd like you to bring them some tulips.

375
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:54,350
POLITICS

376
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:29,420
My dear sir, please
accept my hospitality.

377
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:33,680
Feel that my home is your home.

378
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:38,109
And call upon me as you would a
brother, for any of your needs.

379
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:40,480
You really are to kind.

380
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:46,519
And I must say I'm most impressed by
your command of the English language.

381
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:49,280
I hadn't expect... I mean...

382
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:51,280
I wasn't led to believe...

383
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:55,210
Why... are you here?

384
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,810
I'm here as a representative
of his majesty's government.

385
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,810
Yes?

386
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:06,960
It has been said to me that the
English make a habit of collecting...

387
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,690
countries.

388
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:16,219
Oh! We have no designs upon
your sovereignty at all.

389
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:17,510
No none at all.

390
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:19,900
You would assist us...

391
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:23,150
in defense against mutual enemies?

392
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:44,700
<i>So Orlando, I salute your country.</i>

393
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:49,090
To England, green and pleasant land.

394
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,800
And...

395
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:29,900
And I salute your country...

396
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,920
So...

397
00:44:34,190 --> 00:44:35,920
spacious...

398
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:38,530
And...

399
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:41,390
So... warm.

400
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:46,510
Ah, yes.

401
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:52,170
To the glorious sun which shines
so brightly on this bountiful earth.

402
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:56,140
Quite so.

403
00:44:57,470 --> 00:44:58,410
Erm.

404
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:07,430
Yes!

405
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:09,710
Yes.

406
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:14,400
To beauty of nature.

407
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:17,210
And of course to the beauty of women.

408
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:19,490
And the joys of love.

409
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:31,570
I see.

410
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:36,170
You're here as a casualty
of love, my friend.

411
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:43,070
They're not like us fellows.

412
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,880
Women...

413
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:52,530
it is said...

414
00:45:52,870 --> 00:45:54,790
man should...

415
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:58,840
reverence his guarding
lord who created them.

416
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:04,520
And from from a single being
created of like nature his mate.

417
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:07,510
then from those two...

418
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:09,820
scattered like seeds...

419
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,820
countless men...

420
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:13,820
and women.

421
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,780
So Orlando...

422
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:30,590
Let us now drink to brotherly love.

423
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:42,490
To the manly virtues.

424
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,270
Loyalty.

425
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,070
Courage.

426
00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:13,110
<i>Take me to your master my dear fellow.</i>

427
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:19,030
<i>I said, take me to your master.</i>

428
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:21,760
<i>Do you speak English?</i>

429
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:24,060
<i>Do you speak English?</i>

430
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:28,690
<i>Now look I can assure you
he'll would want to see me.</i>

431
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:31,980
<i>Just let me pass those, good now.</i>

432
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:40,360
Lord Orlando?

433
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:49,690
I.. er...

434
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:56,350
May I present myself,
I am the archduke Harry.

435
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:00,000
Emissary from her majesty.

436
00:49:01,050 --> 00:49:04,890
I have come to inform you that
your ten years here as ambassador...

437
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:08,320
have been well
appreciated by her majesty.

438
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:12,120
would like to celebrate
the new century...

439
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:13,890
by raising you...

440
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:15,890
to the highest rank...

441
00:49:15,930 --> 00:49:17,019
in the...

442
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:18,489
peerage.

443
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:19,780
Ahh.

444
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:22,710
There must be a party.

445
00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:25,829
well of course one must demonstrate
the gravity of an investiture,

446
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:30,020
A large party, food and entertainment.

447
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:33,380
But of course you know
that they call customs

448
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:41,160
Exactly who you should
invite, to the ball. Who's who.

449
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:30,250
Strange.

450
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,810
Most strange.

451
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:37,890
Perhaps they don't hold
punctuality in high regard?

452
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:13,050
As a representative of
her majesty Queen Anne.

453
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:15,049
I am pleased...

454
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:17,049
and honored...

455
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:21,050
to bestow the most noble
Order of the Bath...

456
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:23,680
upon this...

457
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:26,290
loyal servant...

458
00:51:32,970 --> 00:51:36,739
for ambassadorial services rendered...

459
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:38,589
to the Crown...

460
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:40,069
and...

461
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:43,020
for the glory of god.

462
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:09,480
- I'm sorry to arrive in this fashion but we must talk.
- But this is outrageous!

463
00:52:11,850 --> 00:52:16,480
I was expecting you as a guest at my party, I
didn't realize you were entertaining hostilities.

464
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:20,720
I was warned that Englishman
would be dangerous for me.

465
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:23,919
I would like to give you an
opportunity to prove this wrong.

466
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:27,560
Then let me introduce you, this
is the archduke Harry from England.

467
00:52:27,710 --> 00:52:29,190
Delighted.

468
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:31,900
Orlando.

469
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,540
Our enemies are at the city wall.

470
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:38,330
Will you help?

471
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:43,280
You wish me to take arms?

472
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:46,600
Truly Orlando you an
Englishman are not afraid?

473
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:48,200
Sir!

474
00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:51,360
My Lord.

475
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:56,040
Despite these appalling manners

476
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:59,590
we must keep our interests
alive in this region.

477
00:53:00,370 --> 00:53:02,520
What do you recommend.

478
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:09,739
- Harry, distribute your arms.
- But these fellows?

479
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:12,150
- Do as I say!
- But sir!

480
00:53:34,190 --> 00:53:35,720
Follow me.

481
00:53:41,490 --> 00:53:43,020
Brother.

482
00:54:15,490 --> 00:54:17,400
Leave him.

483
00:54:18,290 --> 00:54:19,650
Leave him.

484
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:22,090
This is a dying man.

485
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:25,010
He's not a man, he's the enemy.

486
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:25,270
Same person.

487
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:28,050
No difference at all.

488
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:35,290
Just a different sex.

489
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:54,420
Well, here I am again.

490
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:26,130
SOCIETY

491
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:30,880
Some more invitations my lady.

492
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:38,859
Is not this the lady famed
for her literary gatherings?

493
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:43,760
Yes ma'am, but you could not
possibly venture there. Alone.

494
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:44,999
Why ever not?

495
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:51,080
Society ma'am is full of dangerous
individuals, which and... poets.

496
01:00:55,440 --> 01:01:03,840
<i>♫ Where you walk, call
gale shall find the glade. ♫</i>

497
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:07,289
And how is your leg now Mr. Swift?

498
01:01:07,290 --> 01:01:12,939
I have to tell you that the gout have left
my left leg and is traveled to my right.

499
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:15,419
Aah, the conversation is of legs.

500
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:16,819
Gout Mr. Pope.

501
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:18,900
You are an expert in this field?

502
01:01:18,970 --> 01:01:21,900
I believe I can say
I have some knowledge.

503
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:24,479
A little learning is a dangerous thing.

504
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:29,490
Mr. Pope, I must write
that down at once.

505
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:32,029
I already have madam.

506
01:01:32,030 --> 01:01:36,600
If taken as a science the study of
ailments can be quite fascinating.

507
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:40,790
Indeed I believe science to
be interesting than poetry.

508
01:01:44,890 --> 01:01:46,440
Do you?

509
01:01:48,010 --> 01:01:50,620
Appraise sir, Elaborate.

510
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:59,080
We.. well the systematic
study, exploration...

511
01:01:59,130 --> 01:02:02,960
and taming of the material world...

512
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:07,500
is surely a proper occupation for a man.

513
01:02:08,380 --> 01:02:10,209
Compared to which...

514
01:02:10,210 --> 01:02:14,390
the introvert art of scribbling...

515
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:30,209
wishfully...

516
01:02:30,210 --> 01:02:33,929
the occupation of... of...

517
01:02:33,930 --> 01:02:35,930
a fool?

518
01:02:37,430 --> 01:02:41,180
So I admit a general rule
that every poet is a fool.

519
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:44,230
But you yourself may server to show it.

520
01:02:44,350 --> 01:02:47,279
That every fool is not a poet.

521
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:52,360
Mr. Pope, you're pleased to be witty.

522
01:03:13,690 --> 01:03:19,030
They are all words and
no breeding archduke.

523
01:03:19,130 --> 01:03:22,119
- But so amusing.
- Countess, forgive me.

524
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:23,590
But the young lady who has joined us...

525
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:27,410
...bears the extraordinary resemblance to...
- The Lady Orlando.

526
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:29,480
Orlando.

527
01:03:31,990 --> 01:03:34,609
I were so proud of you Harry.

528
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:36,609
The Order of the Bath.

529
01:03:36,610 --> 01:03:40,510
Marvelous. Cream?

530
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:16,930
Well how pleasant it is I'd live to sip
tea in the presence of a gracious lady.

531
01:04:17,030 --> 01:04:18,619
Do you Pestradus.

532
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:25,920
As our good friend Dr. Johnson says
Every man is or desires to be an... idler.

533
01:04:27,070 --> 01:04:30,130
Perhaps not every woman Mr. Swift.

534
01:04:30,970 --> 01:04:34,839
Women have no desires, only affectation.

535
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:37,819
Indeed women are but
children of larger growth.

536
01:04:37,820 --> 01:04:41,210
Aaa, but I consider woman to
be a beautiful romantic animal.

537
01:04:41,270 --> 01:04:43,109
Who should be adorned in...

538
01:04:43,110 --> 01:04:46,209
Furs and feathers, pearls and diamonds.

539
01:04:46,210 --> 01:04:47,909
Apart from my wife of course.

540
01:04:47,910 --> 01:04:50,550
Will insist upon
attempting to learn Greek.

541
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:55,500
It's so very unbecoming I can hardly tolerate her
company at the breakfast table. Why do they do it?

542
01:04:55,530 --> 01:04:59,490
Oh, every woman is adverse to
contradiction and frankly...

543
01:04:59,810 --> 01:05:02,320
most women have no characters at all.

544
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:05,680
Present company accepted of course.

545
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:11,560
Oh, the lady is aflame.

546
01:05:12,530 --> 01:05:14,220
And silent.

547
01:05:16,910 --> 01:05:18,530
Perfect.

548
01:05:22,950 --> 01:05:24,540
Gentlemen.

549
01:05:24,790 --> 01:05:26,840
I find it strange.

550
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:31,500
You are poets, each one of you and
speak of your muse in the feminine.

551
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:34,320
And yet you appear to
feel neither tenderness...

552
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:38,619
nor respect towards your wives
nor towards females in general.

553
01:05:38,620 --> 01:05:44,820
Madam! I have only the highest
regard and purest respect for females.

554
01:05:45,190 --> 01:05:48,460
I find no evidence of that
sentiment in your conversation.

555
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:52,600
Conversation is a place where
plays with ideas my dear lady.

556
01:05:52,830 --> 01:05:55,120
The one forges them quite alone.

557
01:05:55,170 --> 01:05:57,360
- Quite so.
- Quite. Quite.

558
01:05:57,650 --> 01:06:00,170
The intellect is a solitary place.

559
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:06,690
And therefore quite unsuitable a terrain for females who must
discover their natures through the guidance of a father or husband.

560
01:06:08,290 --> 01:06:10,570
And if she has neither?

561
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:12,570
Then...

562
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:15,510
However charming she may be dear lady...

563
01:06:17,210 --> 01:06:18,990
She is lost.

564
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:29,560
None of us knew what had happened.

565
01:06:29,950 --> 01:06:31,619
It is extraordinary.

566
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:35,670
And to think we could have
been so charmingly misled.

567
01:06:53,970 --> 01:06:57,930
Dear Lady! Orlando!

568
01:07:02,770 --> 01:07:04,390
The same.

569
01:07:04,930 --> 01:07:07,610
We wish to inform you.

570
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:10,590
Madam.

571
01:07:11,010 --> 01:07:16,849
That you are a party to several major lawsuits that
have been preferred against you concerning the property.

572
01:07:16,850 --> 01:07:19,070
The family seat.

573
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:21,560
Pray continue.

574
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:23,560
Erh heh.

575
01:07:25,030 --> 01:07:30,790
One: You are legally dead and therefore
cannot hold any property whatsoever.

576
01:07:30,870 --> 01:07:32,010
Ah.

577
01:07:33,010 --> 01:07:34,010
Fine.

578
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:40,090
Two: You are now female.
- Which amounts much the same thing.

579
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:43,230
Pending the legal judgment however..

580
01:07:43,330 --> 01:07:47,030
You have the laws permission
to reside in the property

581
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:53,110
- in a state of incognito.
- Or incognita as the case may be.

582
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:58,880
- Harry!
- There is only one solution in your current predicament.

583
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:00,430
Indeed.

584
01:08:00,550 --> 01:08:04,570
I can offer you a
house to rival your own.

585
01:08:05,710 --> 01:08:07,480
I don't quite understand.

586
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:09,179
I confess.

587
01:08:09,180 --> 01:08:14,110
Orlando, to me you were and always
will be, weather male or female...

588
01:08:14,180 --> 01:08:18,740
The pink the pearl and the
perfection of your? seas?

589
01:08:23,410 --> 01:08:26,000
I'm offering you my hand.

590
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:30,480
Oh! Archduke.

591
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:33,810
That is very kind of you, yes.

592
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:35,810
I can't accept.

593
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:37,920
But I...

594
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:41,230
I, am England.

595
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:44,330
And you are mine.

596
01:08:44,410 --> 01:08:46,080
I see.

597
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:48,270
On what grounds?

598
01:08:49,110 --> 01:08:51,180
That I adore you.

599
01:08:51,750 --> 01:08:54,920
And this means that I belong to you?

600
01:08:55,470 --> 01:08:58,690
- Are you refusing me?
- I am, I'm sorry.

601
01:08:59,110 --> 01:09:01,400
But Orlando.

602
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:04,750
With your history quite
frankly who else will have you?

603
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:07,430
Do you realize what you're turning down?

604
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:13,320
With your ambiguous sexuality
which I am prepared to tolerate.

605
01:09:14,110 --> 01:09:17,559
This is your last
chance of respectability.

606
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:19,060
Can't breathe.

607
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:23,400
You will die a spinster,
dispossessed and alone.

608
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:36,780
Spinster!

609
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:42,000
Alone!

610
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:49,650
Nature, nature, I'm your bride. Take me!

611
01:11:05,140 --> 01:11:09,570
SEX

612
01:11:28,470 --> 01:11:30,170
You're hurt ma'am?

613
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:32,360
I'm dead, sir.

614
01:11:32,660 --> 01:11:35,530
Dead. That's serious. Can I help?

615
01:11:36,570 --> 01:11:38,400
Will you marry me?

616
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:45,460
Ma'am... I would gladly... um,
I... but I fear my ankle is twisted.

617
01:12:00,570 --> 01:12:02,309
What's that?

618
01:12:02,310 --> 01:12:04,310
The future.

619
01:12:28,990 --> 01:12:33,100
Some milk? My god I don't
yet know your name, sir.

620
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:37,140
How strange, I feel as though
I know everything about you.

621
01:12:37,250 --> 01:12:40,640
When like meets like.
My name is Shelmerdine.

622
01:12:40,690 --> 01:12:42,220
Orlando.

623
01:12:42,270 --> 01:12:46,440
So..it only remains to fill in
such unimportant details as..

624
01:12:46,510 --> 01:12:48,620
What we do and so on.

625
01:12:48,940 --> 01:12:51,580
Well you can see for
yourself what I was.

626
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:53,580
Was?

627
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:25,060
You see, I'm about to loose everything.

628
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:30,350
Then you can come with me.

629
01:13:32,380 --> 01:13:34,370
Where are you going?

630
01:13:34,890 --> 01:13:36,910
Back to America?

631
01:13:37,210 --> 01:13:39,870
When the wind changes
to the south-west.

632
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,290
America.

633
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:48,540
I've been abroad.

634
01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:50,540
But east.

635
01:13:50,650 --> 01:13:53,730
Then you know as well as
I, how good it is to travel.

636
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:57,940
Like a free spirit.

637
01:13:58,070 --> 01:14:00,970
Unfeathered by position or possession.

638
01:14:05,780 --> 01:14:07,450
Unfeathered.

639
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:11,120
Are you...

640
01:14:11,220 --> 01:14:14,520
An adventurer by profession?

641
01:14:17,610 --> 01:14:21,420
My profession, if you
can call it that...

642
01:14:21,550 --> 01:14:23,690
it's the pursuit of liberty.

643
01:14:25,950 --> 01:14:30,460
The bright shade, of
some immortal dream.

644
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:34,750
Which walks when tempus sleeps.

645
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:38,500
The wave of life's dark stream.

646
01:14:39,660 --> 01:14:42,410
You don't really want a husband.

647
01:14:43,170 --> 01:14:46,750
I suppose your journey is
to be hazardous at times.

648
01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:49,820
Think, you want a lover.

649
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:52,490
You've fought in battles?

650
01:14:52,590 --> 01:14:54,900
Like a man?

651
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:57,170
I have fought.

652
01:14:57,590 --> 01:14:59,170
Blood?

653
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:01,600
If necessary, yes.

654
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:05,610
Freedom must be taken,
if it must be won.

655
01:15:08,260 --> 01:15:10,570
If I were a man...

656
01:15:10,860 --> 01:15:12,460
You?

657
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:19,540
I might choose not to risk my
life for an uncertain cause.

658
01:15:20,230 --> 01:15:25,060
I might think that freedom won
by death is not worth having.

659
01:15:26,970 --> 01:15:28,180
In fact...

660
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:32,770
You might choose not
to be a real man at all.

661
01:15:35,850 --> 01:15:37,930
Say, if I were a woman...

662
01:15:39,420 --> 01:15:41,020
You?

663
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:47,100
I might choose not to sacrifice
my life caring for my children,

664
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:50,150
nor my children's children,

665
01:15:50,350 --> 01:15:54,740
nor to drown anonymously in
the milk of female kindness,

666
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:59,980
but instead, say, to go abroad.

667
01:16:01,510 --> 01:16:03,730
Would I then be...

668
01:16:06,050 --> 01:16:09,550
A real woman?

669
01:16:29,060 --> 01:16:36,000
I think I'm going to faint. I've
never felt better in my life.

670
01:19:17,870 --> 01:19:22,010
Rise, from pains of thee.

671
01:19:23,170 --> 01:19:27,200
From first sweet sleep of night.

672
01:19:27,970 --> 01:19:31,590
Winds are breathing low.

673
01:19:31,940 --> 01:19:35,910
Heavens stars are shining bright.

674
01:19:46,230 --> 01:19:49,650
But it is day.

675
01:19:51,050 --> 01:19:54,480
Days are nice.

676
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:59,130
Mingling are sweet embrace on end.

677
01:20:07,530 --> 01:20:08,709
Who's there?

678
01:20:08,710 --> 01:20:14,130
Excuse me my lady, there are two officers
outside with a warrant from the queen.

679
01:20:14,190 --> 01:20:15,790
The queen?

680
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:20,610
Victoria, ma'am. The gentlemen say
they must speak to you in person.

681
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:24,660
Oh.

682
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:28,010
I'd almost forgotten.

683
01:20:33,350 --> 01:20:35,940
Her ladyship.

684
01:20:37,710 --> 01:20:40,020
The lawsuit is settled.

685
01:20:40,180 --> 01:20:46,410
My sex is pronounced indisputably and
beyond shadow of a doubt... female...

686
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:53,030
Therefore heirs made of my body will risk it taking
as red. I loose everything unless I have a son!

687
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:03,030
So you're free.

688
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:07,250
I think the spirit of this century
is finally taken me and broken me.

689
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:10,690
I would be sad if it were true.

690
01:21:11,170 --> 01:21:12,760
But it is not.

691
01:21:12,980 --> 01:21:14,830
Come with me.

692
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:17,080
I cannot.

693
01:21:17,390 --> 01:21:19,240
I can't just follow you.

694
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:24,810
You can stay and stagnate in the past or leave
and live for the future, the choice is yours.

695
01:21:25,060 --> 01:21:29,960
- As a man one has choices, Shelmerdine.
- Orlando, you can do whatever you want.

696
01:21:30,230 --> 01:21:32,520
Would you like to have a child with me?

697
01:21:32,620 --> 01:21:34,770
So that you can keep your house?

698
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:39,190
No, not for the house
Shelmerdine. Perhaps for love?

699
01:21:39,470 --> 01:21:42,480
These are the times
that try men's souls.

700
01:21:42,570 --> 01:21:45,729
My love is for mankind,
I must fight for liberty.

701
01:21:45,730 --> 01:21:49,100
- I must fight for a future.
- For a future?

702
01:21:49,230 --> 01:21:54,500
This future of yours Shelmerdine,
when it's gonna begin... today?

703
01:21:54,550 --> 01:21:57,010
or is it always tomorrow?

704
01:21:57,300 --> 01:22:00,450
Touché Orlando.

705
01:22:07,570 --> 01:22:10,610
The wind!

706
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,360
The wind.

707
01:22:13,540 --> 01:22:16,540
The south-west wind.

708
01:22:43,450 --> 01:22:47,780
Good bye, Shelmerdine! Good luck!

709
01:22:48,030 --> 01:22:50,100
Orlando!

710
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:37,870
BIRTH

711
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:51,710
It's really very good.

712
01:24:52,580 --> 01:24:56,470
Written from the heart.

713
01:24:57,630 --> 01:25:00,110
I think it'll sell.

714
01:25:00,870 --> 01:25:03,810
Provided you rewrite it. You know.

715
01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:08,050
Increase the love interest.
Give it a happy ending.

716
01:25:08,580 --> 01:25:12,870
By the way, how long
did this draft take you?

717
01:26:51,340 --> 01:26:53,279
Come on. Come on.

718
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:54,810
<i>She.</i>

719
01:26:55,260 --> 01:26:58,670
<i>For there can be no doubt about her sex.</i>

720
01:26:58,820 --> 01:27:05,100
<i>Is visiting the house she finally lost
for the first time in over a hundred years.</i>

721
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:09,560
<i>She does still have certain
natural advantages of course.</i>

722
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:17,060
<i>She is tall and slim, with a slightly androgynous
appearance that many females at the time aspire to.</i>

723
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:19,819
<i>Then her upbringing,</i>

724
01:27:19,820 --> 01:27:25,080
<i>she's lived for four hundred
years and hardly aged a day.</i>

725
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:27,570
<i>And because this is England.</i>

726
01:27:27,620 --> 01:27:31,070
<i>Everyone pretends not to notice.</i>

727
01:27:31,660 --> 01:27:34,470
<i>But she has changed.</i>

728
01:27:34,770 --> 01:27:38,430
<i>She is no longer trapped by destiny.</i>

729
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:43,310
<i>And... ever since she
let go of the past...</i>

730
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:47,230
<i>She found her life was beginning.</i>

731
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:20,440
<i>♫ I am coming! I am coming! ♫</i>

732
01:28:20,460 --> 01:28:22,649
<i>♫ I am coming through! ♫</i>

733
01:28:22,650 --> 01:28:26,990
<i>♫ Coming across the divide to you ♫</i>

734
01:28:28,290 --> 01:28:31,300
<i>♫ In this moment of unity ♫</i>

735
01:28:31,420 --> 01:28:33,709
<i>♫ feeling an ecstasy ♫</i>

736
01:28:33,710 --> 01:28:36,320

<i>♫ At last I am free ♫</i>

738
01:28:45,890 --> 01:28:48,220
Why are you sad?

739
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:51,330
I'm not. I'm happy.

740
01:28:51,430 --> 01:28:54,260
Look. Look up there.

741
01:28:54,310 --> 01:28:56,939
<i>♫ Yes at last, at last ♫</i>

742
01:28:56,940 --> 01:28:59,339
<i>♫ to be free of the past ♫</i>
