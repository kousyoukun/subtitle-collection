There's an approaching storm
and he will be

a week of work to be here.

164
00:11:58,786 --> 00:12:01,922
Forget almost.
I was on a story in Valdosta.

165
00:12:01,956 --> 00:12:05,359
You know how long it takes
to get from Georgia,
to New York, to here?

166
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:06,427
Of course you don't.

167
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,362
Well, five hours by rail
to Atlanta

168
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:10,364
and five hours by plane
to New York.

169
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,333
Yeah, okay. Alright.

170
00:12:12,366 --> 00:12:15,369
You will have
the appropriate audience
with Lord Findley, my dear.

171
00:12:16,303 --> 00:12:18,038
I can assure you of that.

172
00:12:18,072 --> 00:12:21,442
Well, if you'll allow me
to show you to your quarters.

173
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:25,479
Uh, Sean and Katherine
will bring your belongings
shortly.

174
00:12:25,513 --> 00:12:28,782
Quarters. I've never
stayed in quarters before.

175
00:12:28,816 --> 00:12:30,117
It's a room.

176
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,819
Welcome, my dear.

177
00:12:32,987 --> 00:12:34,488
Lord Findley has instructed us

178
00:12:34,522 --> 00:12:37,157
to proceed with
the weekend as planned.

179
00:12:37,191 --> 00:12:39,960
As such, there will be
cocktails in the lounge,

180
00:12:39,994 --> 00:12:41,395
once you've settled in.

181
00:12:43,264 --> 00:12:45,899
Welcome to the east wing.

182
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:48,235
If you'll follow me
to your individual quarters,

183
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:51,272
the east wing houses
Lord Findley's guests.

184
00:12:51,305 --> 00:12:52,540
Mr. Walker.

185
00:12:55,476 --> 00:12:58,078
I think you'll find
your accommodations--

186
00:13:00,615 --> 00:13:03,884
Ms. Blanco, Ms. Wang,
and Mr. Armstrong.

187
00:13:11,358 --> 00:13:14,395
I think you'll find
your accommodations
more than satisfactory.

188
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,398
I think this will suffice.

189
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,471
Follow me.

190
00:13:24,506 --> 00:13:25,507
Oh.

191
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:31,979
Mr. Kane. Ms. Green.

192
00:13:34,516 --> 00:13:37,451
Oh, uh, promise me
you'll keep it down, dear.

193
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,053
I'm a bit of a light sleeper.

194
00:13:39,086 --> 00:13:41,155
Only if you guarantee the same.

195
00:13:41,188 --> 00:13:42,356
Hm.

196
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:45,359
Don't fret, Miss Green,

197
00:13:45,392 --> 00:13:48,228
Lord Findley knows
his guests value their privacy.

198
00:13:48,262 --> 00:13:51,332
The rooms
have been soundproofed.

199
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:19,319
[Phillip]
I still find it funny.

200
00:15:19,353 --> 00:15:20,421
Thank you.

201
00:15:20,454 --> 00:15:24,191
[indistinct chatter]

202
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:26,628
[Phillip] My, my. My, my.
[indistinct]

203
00:15:26,661 --> 00:15:30,632
- I had not seen that...
- No, well, I think...

204
00:15:30,665 --> 00:15:34,669
Ah, Miss Green,
what a pleasure it is
to have you join us.

205
00:15:34,702 --> 00:15:36,538
Would you care
for a refreshment?

206
00:15:36,571 --> 00:15:38,673
He makes a splendid Manhattan.

207
00:15:38,706 --> 00:15:43,444
Well, the master
also has a stocked cellar
from his private vineyard.

208
00:15:43,477 --> 00:15:45,412
That would be splendid.

209
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:50,552
A vintage the master
was particularly fond of.

210
00:15:50,585 --> 00:15:51,619
Was?

211
00:15:51,653 --> 00:15:54,421
Hmm?
Oh, my apologies of course.

212
00:15:54,455 --> 00:15:58,125
No, the master simply had a...
well, a change of taste.

213
00:15:58,158 --> 00:16:00,461
Well, it's certainly better
than what I'm used to.

214
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:03,531
Not much of a drinker, are you?

215
00:16:03,565 --> 00:16:06,768
I prefer to keep a clear head
in unfamiliar surroundings.

216
00:16:06,801 --> 00:16:09,069
Eh, that's smart.
I got this, thanks.

217
00:16:09,637 --> 00:16:11,205
Oh, Mr. Walker!

218
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:14,341
What? The old man won't miss it.
Will he?

219
00:16:15,677 --> 00:16:17,110
Of course not, sir.

220
00:16:18,813 --> 00:16:20,013
Hmm.

221
00:16:21,415 --> 00:16:23,150
A toast, shall we?

222
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:24,719
Since we're all
finally here together.

223
00:16:24,752 --> 00:16:27,354
What a lovely idea.
Come on, come on, come on.

224
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:28,756
Gather around.

225
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:31,291
You too, Walker,
you can brood later.

226
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:32,760
- Up, up, up.
- [laughter]

227
00:16:32,794 --> 00:16:34,662
[Lawrence clears throat]

228
00:16:34,696 --> 00:16:36,396
What shall we toast to?

229
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,432
To our generous host?

230
00:16:38,465 --> 00:16:41,235
To the workers
he used and discarded.

231
00:16:41,268 --> 00:16:44,338
- Oh.
- Why don't we toast
to new friends?

232
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:48,308
Whatever the reason
and wherever the location,
we're all here together.

233
00:16:48,342 --> 00:16:51,411
In this world,
it's a small miracle.

234
00:16:51,445 --> 00:16:52,446
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

235
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,480
- Cheers.
- [loud bang]

236
00:16:53,515 --> 00:16:57,117
- Oh.
- [record skipping]

237
00:16:57,819 --> 00:16:59,386
Terribly sorry.

238
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:01,221
[Lawrence] Oh, bloody hell.
[chuckles]

239
00:17:01,255 --> 00:17:02,657
- [clears throat]
- [Phillip]
Quite bit of a fight.

240
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,325
Why don't we all get to
know each other a little better?

241
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,561
- Ooh.
- Ah.

242
00:17:06,594 --> 00:17:08,061
Shall we play a game?

243
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,797
A delightful idea.

244
00:17:09,831 --> 00:17:13,835
I assume we all know
how to play
Two Truths and a Lie.

245
00:17:13,868 --> 00:17:15,369
- Nope.
- Oh, God.

246
00:17:15,402 --> 00:17:17,639
Oh, stop it you two.
This is going to be fun.

247
00:17:17,672 --> 00:17:19,406
- [Donald] Mm.
- I shall go first.

248
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,307
[chuckles]

249
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:23,443
- I am from Seville, Spain.
- Mm-hmm.

250
00:17:23,477 --> 00:17:25,547
I am a waitress
at my father's restaurant.

251
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,781
- Hmm.
- Lie.

252
00:17:26,814 --> 00:17:28,148
Huh.

253
00:17:28,181 --> 00:17:30,484
Your bag looked
to be secondhand,

254
00:17:30,518 --> 00:17:35,088
and your coat,
it was a child size,
English in origin.

255
00:17:35,122 --> 00:17:36,524
But if your father
owned a restaurant,

256
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:38,492
it would stand to reason
you would be able to afford

257
00:17:38,526 --> 00:17:39,861
at least one of the two, so...

258
00:17:39,894 --> 00:17:42,462
That's remarkable.
Is that true?

259
00:17:42,496 --> 00:17:46,768
Yes.
I-I never knew my father.

260
00:17:47,635 --> 00:17:49,102
Oh, Carmen.

261
00:17:49,871 --> 00:17:52,205
Dear,
I'm-I'm so sorry. I didn't--

262
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:55,375
Hey, it is alright.
Good guess.

263
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:57,377
Yeah, but it's not a guess,
is it?

264
00:17:57,411 --> 00:18:00,180
How did you do that?

265
00:18:00,915 --> 00:18:02,684
I just pay attention.

266
00:18:03,685 --> 00:18:05,319
I have a good memory,
I suppose.

267
00:18:05,352 --> 00:18:08,155
No, I have a-a good memory,
this is--

268
00:18:08,188 --> 00:18:09,624
this is something else entirely.

269
00:18:09,657 --> 00:18:12,727
Now, this is getting good.
You go, Doc.

270
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,495
- I don't--
- No. No, we're doin' this.

271
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:17,665
Come on, kid,
two truths one lie, go.

272
00:18:17,699 --> 00:18:22,235
Very well.
Um, I graduated from Oxford,

273
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:23,838
my father
also graduated from--

274
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,205
Lie.

275
00:18:25,673 --> 00:18:27,675
You don't know
your father either, do you?

276
00:18:29,711 --> 00:18:31,311
He's dead, isn't he?

277
00:18:31,345 --> 00:18:32,647
Come on, how?

278
00:18:33,081 --> 00:18:36,450
[exhales] Well, his shoes
weren't properly polished,

279
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:39,520
and on the train,
when he spoke of his family,

280
00:18:39,554 --> 00:18:42,155
he skipped from mother to uncle.
So, it stands to reason--

281
00:18:42,189 --> 00:18:43,758
Stands to reason.

282
00:18:44,592 --> 00:18:46,360
My father passed, too,

283
00:18:46,393 --> 00:18:47,595
if it's any consolation.

284
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:53,768
It appears we have
our first commonality.

285
00:18:54,102 --> 00:19:00,340
No, my father is alive
and well in Guangzhou.

286
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:04,512
Um, and you, Lawrence?

287
00:19:05,513 --> 00:19:06,814
Buckinghamshire.

288
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:09,651
Mr. Walker?

289
00:19:09,684 --> 00:19:11,318
- I'll play next.
- No, I didn't--

290
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:13,621
One, I'm a reporter
for <i>The Daily Truth.</i>

291
00:19:13,655 --> 00:19:14,889
Two, my mother's dead.

292
00:19:14,922 --> 00:19:17,558
And three,
I've never killed a man before.

293
00:19:17,592 --> 00:19:19,661
Three's the lie.
Game over.

294
00:19:21,763 --> 00:19:24,464
Asking the wrong questions
can get you hurt.

295
00:19:26,466 --> 00:19:27,467
[sighs]

296
00:19:50,825 --> 00:19:55,663
[bell tolling]

297
00:20:03,538 --> 00:20:08,241
I would suggest
you not wander too far.

298
00:20:08,275 --> 00:20:09,911
The house is easy
to get lost in.

299
00:20:09,944 --> 00:20:12,747
Oh, I have an excellent
sense of direction,

300
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,750
but thank you
for your concern, Gordon.

301
00:20:18,986 --> 00:20:21,254
[mysterious music playing]

302
00:20:49,784 --> 00:20:54,789
The master's dog, Blunder,
passed some weeks back.

303
00:20:57,357 --> 00:21:00,695
Then why keep the water fresh?

304
00:21:00,728 --> 00:21:05,432
Well, the master
was very fond of his dog,

305
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:09,637
and I should think
he rather enjoyed the ritual
of tending to him.

306
00:21:11,606 --> 00:21:13,641
Now, if you'll follow me,
please.

307
00:21:13,674 --> 00:21:14,909
Dinner will be served shortly.

308
00:21:14,942 --> 00:21:15,977
Oh, I can make my own--

309
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:19,781
I must insist,
Miss Green, hmm?

310
00:21:19,814 --> 00:21:21,582
This is not your house.

311
00:21:30,658 --> 00:21:31,959
[laughing]

312

00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,530
Oh, my!

314
00:21:35,563 --> 00:21:37,799
This must be
the old man's study.

Adams.

316

My name is Armstrong.

317
00:21:51,145 --> 00:21:54,048
Do not correct me, Adams,

318
00:21:54,081 --> 00:21:58,986
I am your boss, Lewis Findley!

319
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,655
[clears throat]

320
00:22:00,688 --> 00:22:02,790
Yes, sir.

321
00:22:02,824 --> 00:22:07,728
I want you to buy me Seville.

322
00:22:07,762 --> 00:22:09,362
The whole city?

323
00:22:09,396 --> 00:22:10,865
The whole city!

324
00:22:10,898 --> 00:22:13,768
Very well. Done and done.

325
00:22:13,801 --> 00:22:16,369
And what should we do
with your new city, sir?

326
00:22:18,706 --> 00:22:20,473
Burn it to the ground.

327
00:22:21,943 --> 00:22:25,079
It is a place
where dreams go to die.

328
00:22:31,686 --> 00:22:35,823
Perhaps... there is something
else to be done.

329
00:22:37,525 --> 00:22:40,728
Because I know of a girl
who lives there,

330
00:22:40,761 --> 00:22:44,966
who is beautiful and kind.

331
00:22:46,901 --> 00:22:49,737
Maybe we can give her the city,

332
00:22:50,504 --> 00:22:53,841
so she can care for its people
in the manner they deserve.

333
00:23:02,817 --> 00:23:03,918
Hmm.

334
00:23:07,188 --> 00:23:09,523
- Oh, my Lord.
- Mm.

335
00:23:09,557 --> 00:23:10,758
Look at that.

336
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,161
[Carmen] It's beautiful.

337
00:23:14,195 --> 00:23:16,764
It's, uh,
it's called a "katar."

338
00:23:16,797 --> 00:23:18,599
- Hmm.
- It's an ancient Tamil weapon.

339
00:23:19,667 --> 00:23:20,902
Hmm.

340
00:23:22,036 --> 00:23:23,771
Stunning, isn't it?

341
00:23:24,739 --> 00:23:25,806
Yes.

342
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:29,409
[bell jingling]

343
00:23:31,579 --> 00:23:33,014
Uh, right.
[chuckles]

344
00:23:33,047 --> 00:23:34,582
After you, sir.

345
00:23:34,615 --> 00:23:36,617
Oh, why, thank you.
[clears throat]

346
00:23:36,651 --> 00:23:40,655
The man shows up
at his hearing with one shoe.

347
00:23:40,688 --> 00:23:42,723
Well, I-I take one look at him
and I realize

348
00:23:42,757 --> 00:23:46,060
that this is an opportunity
to get the case thrown out.

349
00:23:46,093 --> 00:23:50,463
So, I tell the judge,
"Take a look at his feet."

350
00:23:50,497 --> 00:23:51,732
- I-I--
- [laughs]

351
00:23:51,766 --> 00:23:54,568
You know, I literally hold
the man's foot up--

352
00:23:54,602 --> 00:23:57,470
[coughs, mutters]

353
00:23:57,505 --> 00:23:59,472
- Shoe up and put--
- Come on, offer him water.

354
00:23:59,507 --> 00:24:02,810
- Oh!
- [coughing continues]

355
00:24:05,146 --> 00:24:07,447
Oh, my goodness,
I'm terribly sorry, sir!

356
00:24:08,582 --> 00:24:09,717
[Lawrence] Oh...
[chuckles]

357
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:12,987
It's, uh...
quite all right, dear.

358
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,989
- Now, um, where was I?
- [clears throat]

359
00:24:15,022 --> 00:24:16,691
Uh, Katherine was it?

360
00:24:16,724 --> 00:24:18,526
Would you care to tell us
a bit about yourself?

361
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:21,028
- [exhales] No...
- Or your time
working for Mr. Findley?

362
00:24:21,062 --> 00:24:22,096
Oh, thank Christ.

363
00:24:22,129 --> 00:24:25,166
Um... um...

364
00:24:27,935 --> 00:24:29,637
Oh, well, they can share, too.

365
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:32,773
What a wonderful idea.
Please share, Katherine.

366
00:24:32,807 --> 00:24:35,643
Yeah, Katherine, share.

367
00:24:35,676 --> 00:24:39,513
I wanna hear how
he treats his people.

368
00:24:39,547 --> 00:24:42,216
Hopefully better
than you treated this pork loin.

369
00:24:44,785 --> 00:24:49,991
Mister-- Lord Findley
is kind to us.

370
00:24:50,024 --> 00:24:51,926
He treats us like family.

371
00:25:06,907 --> 00:25:09,543
[footsteps retreating]

372
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:13,848
Was it something I said?

373
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:17,618
[soft chuckle]

374
00:25:21,622 --> 00:25:22,890
[energy powering down]

375
00:25:22,923 --> 00:25:25,292
[woman screaming in distance]

376
00:25:34,068 --> 00:25:36,637
- [gasps]
- Was that you? Screaming?

377
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:39,740
No. What is going on?

378
00:25:39,774 --> 00:25:41,675
It's probably nothing.

379
00:25:41,709 --> 00:25:43,244
Stay in your room
while I check it out.

380
00:25:54,155 --> 00:25:56,223
[inhales sharply]
What are you doing here?

381
00:25:58,692 --> 00:26:00,261
Same thing as you.

382
00:26:00,294 --> 00:26:02,830
Trying to figure out
what's going on here.

383
00:26:06,133 --> 00:26:10,905
Huh, Gordon. I was setting
for an explanation
for the power loss.

384
00:26:10,938 --> 00:26:13,140
Please, follow me.

385
00:26:18,913 --> 00:26:20,281
[energy powers up]

386
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:30,191
Ladies and gentlemen,
there is no cause for alarm.

387
00:26:30,224 --> 00:26:31,725
Well, why did the power go out?

388
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:34,295
It appears the main switch
was flipped,

389
00:26:34,328 --> 00:26:36,630
but there is no reason
for alarm.

390
00:26:36,664 --> 00:26:38,999
There is no one else
on the island, I assure you.

391
00:26:42,136 --> 00:26:43,604
It was likely an animal.

392
00:26:46,073 --> 00:26:48,242
Regardless, I have fixed it,

393
00:26:48,275 --> 00:26:52,079
so there'll be no more
trouble or incidents tonight.

394
00:26:52,113 --> 00:26:54,148
Now, if you'll please
retire to your rooms.

395
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,122
[Lawrence] Hm.

396
00:27:03,824 --> 00:27:05,359
Miss Green, if you please.

397
00:27:05,392 --> 00:27:07,328
Gordon, has there been
any construction

398
00:27:07,361 --> 00:27:09,029
in this hallway recently?

399
00:27:09,063 --> 00:27:10,931
Not that I know of,
why do you ask?

400
00:27:10,965 --> 00:27:13,868
When the power went out,
I heard a woman scream.

401
00:27:13,901 --> 00:27:18,139
Well, your room
is not far from Miss Blanco.

402
00:27:18,172 --> 00:27:19,840
I should think
she had quite a start.

403
00:27:19,874 --> 00:27:22,676
You said the rooms
were soundproof.

404
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:25,012
I suppose her window was open.

405
00:27:26,247 --> 00:27:27,848
Now, there'll be
no more questions.

406
00:27:27,882 --> 00:27:30,284
Would you please return
to your quarters?

407
00:27:30,317 --> 00:27:33,053
I won't leave the hall,
but I don't feel like
going back in there yet.

408
00:27:34,822 --> 00:27:36,724
Very good, miss.

409
00:27:43,864 --> 00:27:45,833
[mysterious music playing]

410
00:28:09,223 --> 00:28:11,425
- [door closes]
- [dogs barking in distance]

411
00:28:28,275 --> 00:28:29,810
[gasps]

412
00:29:08,148 --> 00:29:10,351
[birds chirping]

413
00:29:12,353 --> 00:29:15,089
[clock ticking]

414
00:29:23,063 --> 00:29:25,567
[indistinct chattering]

415
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,368
[Carmen laughing]

416
00:29:27,401 --> 00:29:29,436
- You, too.
- Good morning.

417
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:33,240
Good morning.

418
00:29:33,941 --> 00:29:35,109
Ah...

419
00:29:38,312 --> 00:29:41,415
I was about to go for a walk,
it's a lovely day out.

420
00:29:42,383 --> 00:29:43,384
Oh.

421
00:29:56,463 --> 00:29:58,265
Oh, God, yeah.

422
00:29:58,299 --> 00:29:59,867
I was actually just about
to go for a walk,

423
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,536
if you'd care to join me.

424
00:30:03,404 --> 00:30:06,040
Or if you prefer to stay.

425
00:30:06,073 --> 00:30:09,209
Uh, yeah, I'm, uh,

426
00:30:09,243 --> 00:30:11,945
not much
of a breakfast guy.

427
00:30:11,979 --> 00:30:15,115
More of a coffee
and cigarettes for me.

428
00:30:15,149 --> 00:30:18,919
- Can we smoke in here?
- I'm... not sure.

429
00:30:21,589 --> 00:30:23,891
Right. Well, shall we?

430
00:30:23,924 --> 00:30:24,958
Please.

431
00:30:37,404 --> 00:30:38,839
[Donald]
So, what's your deal?

432
00:30:39,907 --> 00:30:42,042
I'm a florist from London.

433
00:30:42,076 --> 00:30:47,615
No, that's what you do,
or at least what
you say you do.

434
00:30:47,649 --> 00:30:49,584
What's your deal?

435
00:30:49,617 --> 00:30:53,387
I've been watchin' you.
You're smart.

436
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:57,291
Not like that putz doctor,
the real kind.

437
00:30:57,324 --> 00:30:59,293
I see the things
other people miss.

438
00:30:59,326 --> 00:31:02,296
No, it's more than that.

439
00:31:03,163 --> 00:31:07,201
You put things together
in a way I've never seen before.

440
00:31:07,234 --> 00:31:09,136
At least not from a civilian.

441
00:31:09,169 --> 00:31:10,938
And yet that's all I am.

442
00:31:10,971 --> 00:31:14,308
Well, why not put your
detective skills to better use?

443
00:31:14,341 --> 00:31:17,344
Oh, it's just not a fitting
profession for a lady.

444
00:31:17,378 --> 00:31:19,647
There's not a place
at Scotland Yard for me.

445
00:31:19,681 --> 00:31:21,382
So, go private.

446
00:31:22,684 --> 00:31:25,919
You know, I knew a lady gumshoe
in California.

447
00:31:25,953 --> 00:31:28,623
She couldn't have been
more than 20 years old.

448
00:31:28,656 --> 00:31:31,559
Pretty little slip
of a thing, too.

449
00:31:31,593 --> 00:31:33,695
She was the best I've ever seen.

450
00:31:33,728 --> 00:31:36,598
I should like to have
your experiences, Mr. Walker.

451
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:42,369
Trust me, you...
you don't want those.

452
00:31:43,036 --> 00:31:47,609
Speaking of experiences,
is it true you killed a man?

453
00:31:49,644 --> 00:31:54,148
You know, I thought you'd
have gotten to that sooner.

454
00:31:55,349 --> 00:31:57,451
Yeah, it's true.

455
00:31:57,484 --> 00:31:59,654
Look, I'm not proud of it.

456
00:32:00,555 --> 00:32:02,524
What happened?

457
00:32:02,557 --> 00:32:04,324
He was a, uh...

458
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:10,264
he was a hotshot boxing
promoter out of Boston,

459
00:32:10,297 --> 00:32:14,569
and I was doin' a story
on the Irish mob

460
00:32:14,602 --> 00:32:17,572
and their connections
around the city.

461
00:32:17,605 --> 00:32:18,606
One night...

462
00:32:20,742 --> 00:32:23,545
One night, I see him,
and he's with his wife...

463
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:29,049
and he starts beatin' on her,
somethin' fierce.

464
00:32:31,351 --> 00:32:34,321
And then he slipped,
hit his head.

465
00:32:37,024 --> 00:32:41,028
Cost me a hell of a story,
he would have killed her.

466
00:32:42,229 --> 00:32:43,631
I remember that story.

467
00:32:44,532 --> 00:32:46,467
Of course you do.

468
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:50,304
You were let off
because none of the witnesses
would come forward.

469
00:32:50,337 --> 00:32:54,776
Yeah, well, like I said,
he slipped and hit his head,

470
00:32:54,809 --> 00:32:57,144
ten or so times.

471
00:33:01,248 --> 00:33:05,118
I think you're not
the terrifying brute
you try to present.

472
00:33:05,152 --> 00:33:09,423
Still, I would like
to avoid such situations.
[sighs]

473
00:33:09,456 --> 00:33:15,195
Listen, you gotta
get down into the muck
if you wanna find the truth.

474
00:33:15,229 --> 00:33:18,700
You can't have any fear
or limits

475
00:33:18,733 --> 00:33:21,168
to what you'll do
to find your answers.

476
00:33:23,538 --> 00:33:27,174
What I said to you yesterday,
that-that wasn't a threat.

477
00:33:27,207 --> 00:33:28,208
Then what was it?

478
00:33:29,309 --> 00:33:31,746
Call it a
"professional courtesy."

479
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:36,383
Guys like Findley,
they-they got secrets

480
00:33:36,416 --> 00:33:38,620
they won't hesitate to protect.

481
00:33:38,653 --> 00:33:40,487
You don't care
for our host, do you?

482
00:33:41,623 --> 00:33:43,357
I've never met the man.

483
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:44,559
Ah, just when I thought

484
00:33:44,592 --> 00:33:47,227
you were starting to show me
a little respect.

485
00:33:47,261 --> 00:33:49,396
You know,
the comments, the rants...

486
00:33:49,429 --> 00:33:51,431
you have an issue
with Lewis Findley

487
00:33:51,465 --> 00:33:53,701
that doesn't even
require his presence.

488
00:33:55,402 --> 00:33:56,771
You caught me.

489
00:33:56,804 --> 00:33:59,072
Then why come?

490
00:33:59,106 --> 00:34:02,042
Same as you.
I-I've got questions.

491
00:34:03,611 --> 00:34:06,179
I think we may not
find many answers.

492
00:34:07,247 --> 00:34:08,482
Maybe not.

493
00:34:10,752 --> 00:34:12,452
But guys like Findley,

494
00:34:12,486 --> 00:34:14,756
they don't do anything
without an angle.

495
00:34:15,422 --> 00:34:17,859
Hopefully, I can at least
figure that out.

496
00:34:17,892 --> 00:34:21,729
I know it has something
to do with us, but...

497
00:34:22,864 --> 00:34:24,064
Yeah.

498
00:34:25,833 --> 00:34:27,267
Me neither.

499
00:34:27,301 --> 00:34:28,435
Hmm.

500
00:34:31,906 --> 00:34:34,809
You know, yesterday,
I didn't mean to--

501
00:34:34,842 --> 00:34:35,877
Look!

502
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:38,245
[foreboding music playing]

503
00:34:52,459 --> 00:34:53,695
[Donald] What the hell?

504
00:34:54,796 --> 00:34:57,230
[Lu] There's one extra rabbit.

505
00:34:57,264 --> 00:34:59,567
Jesus. And?

506
00:35:01,769 --> 00:35:03,136
Oh, no, you don't.

507
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:04,872
No, you're not
doin' that again.

508
00:35:04,906 --> 00:35:06,373
You can't dumb me up now.

509
00:35:06,406 --> 00:35:08,175
You know somethin',
I wanna hear what it is.

510
00:35:08,208 --> 00:35:10,177
You're gonna tell me.
Where are you going?

511
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:11,579
Come on!

512
00:35:14,314 --> 00:35:15,750
Unbelievable.

513
00:35:16,951 --> 00:35:20,253
Alright,
what the hell is this?

514
00:35:20,287 --> 00:35:22,924
[Miranda]
I think it means there's
someone here who doesn't belong.

515
00:35:22,957 --> 00:35:24,458
Yeah, well, I got my guess.

516
00:35:24,491 --> 00:35:26,259
Oh, she doesn't know anything.

517
00:35:26,293 --> 00:35:27,762
At least I don't think
she does.

518
00:35:27,795 --> 00:35:29,396
Explain that.

519
00:35:29,429 --> 00:35:32,165
Well, she could just as easily
be one of the five.

520
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:36,638
All this does is confirm
that there's someone here
who's not who they say they are.

521
00:35:36,671 --> 00:35:40,708
It's games on top of games,
on top of games.

522
00:35:40,742 --> 00:35:42,644
And we're going to have
to play them all.

523
00:35:45,345 --> 00:35:46,413
[knocking on door]

524
00:35:54,756 --> 00:35:56,624
How may I help you,
Mr. Armstrong?

525
00:35:57,525 --> 00:35:59,694
I think you can call me
"Phillip" at this point.

526
00:35:59,727 --> 00:36:02,362
Oh, no,
I am just a poor waitress

527
00:36:02,396 --> 00:36:04,464
and you a successful doctor.

528
00:36:04,498 --> 00:36:06,834
I know my place, Mr. Armstrong.

529
00:36:06,868 --> 00:36:08,670
I'm hardly rich.

530
00:36:08,703 --> 00:36:12,339
Hmm, you belong in this house
more so than I do, no?

531
00:36:12,372 --> 00:36:16,611
Now, chip-chop, what is it
that you are bothering me for?

532
00:36:16,644 --> 00:36:19,547
I was just about
to take a little nap
before lunch.

533
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,983
It's, um, it's "chop-chop,"
not "chip-chop."

534
00:36:22,016 --> 00:36:25,920
Ah, so you've come
to insult my English.

535
00:36:35,328 --> 00:36:36,496
[moans]

536
00:36:38,032 --> 00:36:41,869
Well, if that is all,
I'd like to take my siesta now.

537
00:36:45,907 --> 00:36:47,575
Right.
[sighs]

538
00:36:50,678 --> 00:36:52,446
I think I'll have a walk.

539
00:36:53,781 --> 00:36:55,516
Yes, I'll have a walk.

540
00:36:56,851 --> 00:36:58,920
[indistinct chattering]

541
00:37:07,628 --> 00:37:09,496
Alright, trust me.

542
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:10,865
This is a bit strange.

543
00:37:10,898 --> 00:37:13,333
[Donald]
If he shows up, I'll eat a bug.

544
00:37:13,366 --> 00:37:14,736
[laughing]

545
00:37:14,769 --> 00:37:17,437
[clears throat]
Alright, what's going on here?

546
00:37:18,472 --> 00:37:23,611
Last night, you couldn't
get enough to eat or drink,

547
00:37:23,644 --> 00:37:28,583
and now you're sharing secrets
and barely eating, hmm?

548
00:37:28,616 --> 00:37:29,717
[Gordon clears throat]

549
00:37:29,751 --> 00:37:31,384
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

550
00:37:32,954 --> 00:37:34,655
Lord Findley is still grounded

551
00:37:34,689 --> 00:37:38,025
and weather conditions
have not improved as expected.

552
00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:41,495
As a result,
he will not be joining us today.

553
00:37:41,529 --> 00:37:42,797
Huh!

554
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:44,031
[sighs]

555
00:37:45,365 --> 00:37:46,433
[chuckles]

556
00:37:47,735 --> 00:37:48,736
[shrieks]

557
00:37:49,937 --> 00:37:51,672
What the bloody hell
are you doing?

558
00:37:52,206 --> 00:37:53,908
Whatever I want, Larry.

559
00:37:54,542 --> 00:37:57,044
Findley's not here
to stop me, is he?

560
00:37:58,445 --> 00:38:00,915
You're mad. He's mad.

561
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:15,763
[Lawrence clears throat,
coughs]

562
00:38:20,101 --> 00:38:22,870
[mysterious music playing]

563
00:38:51,032 --> 00:38:53,534
[muted dialogue]

564
00:39:27,702 --> 00:39:29,704
[bell jingling]

565
00:39:38,145 --> 00:39:40,781
[panting]

566
00:39:44,552 --> 00:39:45,987
Something's happened.

567
00:39:50,858 --> 00:39:51,993
What's goin' on?

568
00:40:00,801 --> 00:40:03,571
[tense music playing]

569
00:40:04,071 --> 00:40:06,707
[panting]

570
00:40:09,076 --> 00:40:10,711
- Is that--
- It's Lawrence.

571
00:40:11,646 --> 00:40:13,648
Kane. Kane.

572
00:40:16,217 --> 00:40:18,886
- [Katherine] Oh, my God.
- How?

573
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,822
Well, gee, let me guess.
He was stabbed.

574
00:40:21,856 --> 00:40:23,423
Kid, go and get the help.

575
00:40:25,492 --> 00:40:27,161
Why put the knife
in the tree?

576
00:40:27,194 --> 00:40:28,930
[Carmen]
Maybe it was a message.

577
00:40:28,963 --> 00:40:30,932
Who could do such a thing?

578
00:40:30,965 --> 00:40:32,667
Someone very determined.

579
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,969
And someone very strong.

580
00:40:35,002 --> 00:40:37,004
Miranda, where are you--
Oh, hell.

581
00:41:10,805 --> 00:41:13,140
[breathing deeply]

582
00:41:28,255 --> 00:41:29,857
You gonna swim for it?

583
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,528
You know, you don't strike me
as the type of person

584
00:41:34,562 --> 00:41:37,131
to go sightseeing
while the rest of us get hunted.

585
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:40,901
This is a nightmare.
The rabbits.

586
00:41:40,935 --> 00:41:41,969
I saw.

587
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:44,071
What do we do?

588
00:41:46,807 --> 00:41:47,842
Use this, sweetheart.

589
00:41:48,709 --> 00:41:50,144
It's not enough, Donald.

590
00:41:50,177 --> 00:41:53,080
Yeah, well, the world's
full of disappointments.

591
00:41:53,114 --> 00:41:55,549
Look, I've been around.

592
00:41:55,583 --> 00:42:00,121
One thing I've learned
is you do what you gotta do
with what you got.

593
00:42:02,023 --> 00:42:03,791
What if I can't?

594
00:42:04,492 --> 00:42:07,261
Well, then we probably all die.

595
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:28,616
We should gather in the lounge.

596
00:42:29,617 --> 00:42:30,851
Is that really a good idea?

597
00:42:30,885 --> 00:42:33,187
Yes, and it wasn't a request.

598
00:42:36,624 --> 00:42:37,958
[clears throat]

599
00:42:44,765 --> 00:42:46,033
Follow.

600
00:42:57,745 --> 00:42:59,847
Let me try once more
from the top.

601
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:00,815
[tense music playing]

602
00:43:00,848 --> 00:43:04,318
Phillip and Carmen
were in the east wing hall,

603
00:43:04,351 --> 00:43:09,123
Lu was in her room,
I was in the study,
Donald was outside,

604
00:43:09,156 --> 00:43:11,058
and the staff is still
all unaccounted for

605
00:43:11,092 --> 00:43:12,793
during the period
where the late Mr. Kane

606
00:43:12,827 --> 00:43:15,362
was being brutally murdered.

607
00:43:15,396 --> 00:43:18,232
As such, I have concluded
that we must treat everyone,

608
00:43:18,265 --> 00:43:20,000
myself included, as a suspect.

609
00:43:20,034 --> 00:43:22,870
- Now, hold on a second. You--
- No one has a valid alibi,

610
00:43:22,903 --> 00:43:24,738
it is the only logical
starting point.

611
00:43:24,772 --> 00:43:26,740
Phillip and I already said

612
00:43:26,774 --> 00:43:28,209
that we were together
in the hall.

613
00:43:28,242 --> 00:43:29,944
Did anyone else
verify this encounter?

614
00:43:29,977 --> 00:43:31,645
I'm sorry.
Is our word no good?

615
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:33,848
Given the fondness
you two have for one another,

616
00:43:33,881 --> 00:43:36,250
it is equally as plausible
you would cover for each other

617
00:43:36,283 --> 00:43:38,986
as it is that you were together
in the east wing hall.

618
00:43:39,019 --> 00:43:41,856
Huh, she's got you there,
kiddies.

619
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:44,859
And what of you and the Yank?

620
00:43:44,892 --> 00:43:47,228
Don't think we haven't
all witnessed your conspiring?

621
00:43:47,261 --> 00:43:49,930
Which is why Mr. Walker
is atop my list of suspects.

622
00:43:49,964 --> 00:43:53,434
Wait, what?
You ungrateful--

623
00:43:53,467 --> 00:43:55,336
You were the closest
to the body.

624
00:43:55,369 --> 00:43:57,972
You are also
the most physically able
to overpower Lawrence.

625
00:43:58,005 --> 00:43:59,140
I barely knew the guy!

626
00:43:59,173 --> 00:44:02,209
Exactly.
We barely know each other,

627
00:44:02,243 --> 00:44:04,111
and you barely knew
the deceased.

628
00:44:04,145 --> 00:44:06,147
We must try to figure out
what connects us

629
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:08,082
to understand
who has a true motive.

630
00:44:08,115 --> 00:44:12,419
Right now,
this is just conjecture
and baseless speculation.

631
00:44:12,453 --> 00:44:14,088
It would help
if we knew anything

632
00:44:14,121 --> 00:44:17,691
about the late Mr. Kane
as a start, anything at all.

633
00:44:21,929 --> 00:44:23,764
- Sean?
- Ma'am.

634
00:44:23,797 --> 00:44:26,300
Can you go look at the body?
Check his pockets.

635
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:28,969
See if there's anything
that might help us know him
a little better.

636
00:44:30,271 --> 00:44:32,373
Yes, of course, ma'am.

637
00:44:34,308 --> 00:44:37,678
Wait, someone
should go with him.

638
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:42,049
- I'll accompany Sean.
- Thank you, sir.

639
00:44:42,082 --> 00:44:44,852
Maybe someone not on the staff.

640
00:45:03,771 --> 00:45:04,772
I will go.

641
00:45:08,909 --> 00:45:10,277
Thank you, my dear.

642
00:45:12,813 --> 00:45:14,148
Well, alright.

643
00:45:15,416 --> 00:45:18,819
Now, sweetheart,
this should be good.

644
00:45:20,187 --> 00:45:24,758
What's the baseless
speculation about you?

645
00:45:24,792 --> 00:45:27,261
Ah, a delightful exercise.

646
00:45:27,294 --> 00:45:31,165
Well, I found
the deceased boorish.

647
00:45:31,198 --> 00:45:33,033
And I was the last person
in the study,

648
00:45:33,067 --> 00:45:35,269
where the dagger
resided on Findley's desk.

649
00:45:35,302 --> 00:45:39,473
Right now, we all have
conceivable opportunity
and equally likely motives,

650
00:45:39,507 --> 00:45:42,209
which is why
we can't rule anyone out.

651
00:45:43,578 --> 00:45:44,845
Including you.

652
00:45:55,489 --> 00:45:59,093
Miss Green,
I hardly think that's
an appropriate accusation.

653
00:45:59,126 --> 00:46:01,495
If we know little
about each other,
we know even less about them.

654
00:46:01,529 --> 00:46:03,163
And it was one of us killed!

655
00:46:03,197 --> 00:46:05,132
We mustn't resort
to tribal suspicions.

656
00:46:05,165 --> 00:46:08,235
I am merely asserting
that anyone of us
can be a suspect

657
00:46:08,269 --> 00:46:09,870
until we can gather
more information

658
00:46:09,903 --> 00:46:12,072
and begin
ruling individuals out.

659
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:14,908
- The body is gone!
- What?

660
00:46:14,942 --> 00:46:16,944
Mr. Kane's body is missing.

661
00:46:16,977 --> 00:46:18,145
I think we all understood
the first time,

662
00:46:18,178 --> 00:46:20,214
but just to reiterate, what?

663
00:46:20,247 --> 00:46:22,416
Bodies do not just get up
and walk away.

664
00:46:22,449 --> 00:46:25,452
No, dear, they do not.
And I know from experience.

665
00:46:25,486 --> 00:46:27,388
I need to see this for myself.

666
00:46:34,061 --> 00:46:37,565
Okay. What did you do?

667
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:39,500
What's going on?
Is the body there or not?

668
00:46:39,534 --> 00:46:41,368
- No.
- That's impossible.

669
00:46:41,402 --> 00:46:43,170
Not if she
and the old man moved it.

670
00:46:43,203 --> 00:46:46,340
Why and how would I
accomplish that, Mr. Walker?

671
00:46:46,373 --> 00:46:48,042
One mystery at a time.

672
00:46:48,075 --> 00:46:49,977
I still think they
had something to do with it.

673
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:52,547
We must watch our insinuations
and accusations.

674
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:56,150
Oh, now, we should
watch our insinuations?

675
00:46:56,183 --> 00:46:59,086
I'd like to know
where all of you were
at the time Kane was killed,

676
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:01,589
and it would be
in your best interest
to tell us now.

677
00:47:01,623 --> 00:47:04,626
- Is that a threat, sir?
- I don't know, Jeeves, is it?

678
00:47:04,659 --> 00:47:06,260
Now, hold on,
this is ridiculous.

679
00:47:06,293 --> 00:47:09,229
We must not to let our emotions
get the best of us.

680
00:47:09,263 --> 00:47:11,298
May I make a suggestion?

681
00:47:11,332 --> 00:47:13,233
You haven't needed
permission thus far.

682
00:47:14,034 --> 00:47:16,504
Why don't we take
to our rooms until dinner?

683
00:47:16,538 --> 00:47:19,641
It's 5:00 now,
that's two and a half hours.

684
00:47:19,674 --> 00:47:22,409
That's plenty of time
for tempers to subside

685
00:47:22,443 --> 00:47:24,011
and then we can start
a conversation

686
00:47:24,044 --> 00:47:26,914
that's based on facts
and provable truths.

687
00:47:26,947 --> 00:47:28,882
What about us?

688
00:47:28,916 --> 00:47:31,085
Who is supposed
to prepare the meal?

689
00:47:31,118 --> 00:47:33,020
I don't feel safe
in the kitchen alone.

690
00:47:33,053 --> 00:47:36,223
Why don't we take heed
to travel in pairs or groups?

691
00:47:36,256 --> 00:47:39,159
- This is a good idea.
- Fine by me.

692
00:47:47,267 --> 00:47:49,103
Lock your doors!

693
00:47:49,136 --> 00:47:50,204
I need a drink.

694
00:47:50,237 --> 00:47:52,306
Refreshments can be
brought up, sir.

695
00:47:52,339 --> 00:47:54,375
- Yeah, I got it. Thanks.
- Of course.

696
00:47:54,408 --> 00:47:56,009
My dear, shall we?

697
00:48:00,047 --> 00:48:01,583
Well, that was a mistake.

698
00:48:01,616 --> 00:48:05,152
I don't remember you
asking for my loyalty.

699
00:48:05,185 --> 00:48:08,288
And, more importantly,
I don't remember
giving you mine.

700
00:48:08,322 --> 00:48:14,461
Yeah, well,
now you got no one
to watch your back, sweetheart.

00:48:17,732 --> 00:48:19,333
[sighs]

702
00:48:26,306 --> 00:48:28,543
When the others
lock their doors,

703
00:48:28,576 --> 00:48:31,679
please come to my room.
I don't wanna be alone.

704
00:48:31,713 --> 00:48:35,249
Of course,
but we must be careful

705
00:48:35,282 --> 00:48:36,984
until we get off this island.

706
00:48:40,622 --> 00:48:42,624
Come on.

I'm so scared.

711
00:49:45,452 --> 00:49:47,187
Findley will be here
in the morning,

712
00:49:47,221 --> 00:49:48,723
and we'll get to
the bottom of all this.

713
00:49:48,756 --> 00:49:50,390
There's nothing to fear.

714
00:49:50,424 --> 00:49:52,226
And what of us?

715
00:49:52,259 --> 00:49:55,597
We can leave and be together.

716
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:57,297
You can visit me in London.

717
00:49:57,331 --> 00:49:59,333
London is dreary.

718
00:50:00,467 --> 00:50:02,202
Then I shall come to Seville.

719
00:50:03,337 --> 00:50:05,405
I hate Seville.

720
00:50:06,206 --> 00:50:09,276
Then we can go anywhere
in the world that you desire.

721
00:50:09,309 --> 00:50:13,515
And if you can't pick one place,
we'll go everywhere.

722
00:50:13,548 --> 00:50:16,751
It doesn't matter
so long as we're together.

723
00:50:17,819 --> 00:50:19,787
What a beautiful dream.

724
00:50:19,821 --> 00:50:21,556
Then let's make it real.

725
00:50:24,692 --> 00:50:28,195
Sometimes I forget
how young you are,

726
00:50:29,229 --> 00:50:31,298
how simple your life has been.

727

What does that mean?

728
00:50:37,805 --> 00:50:40,240
Nothing, darling.

about your beautiful dream.

as anticipated.

To whom does this belong?

- Miss Wang, please follow me.
- Where are we going?

754

You'll be spending
the rest of the night
locked in your room,

755
00:55:24,525 --> 00:55:26,928
and in the morning
you'll be turned over
to the proper authorities.

I did not kill this man!

don't make this any harder

Sean was an old man.

The killer did incapacitate him
by knocking him with the door.

It's not outside the realm

That's your big reveal? A coat?

799
00:58:10,124 --> 00:58:12,727
No, that's just a taste.

800
00:58:18,232 --> 00:58:19,700
[door creaks open]

801
00:58:19,734 --> 00:58:21,669
Watch your step,
careful now.

802
00:58:31,846 --> 00:58:35,750
Alright, you got us
all packed in here. Now, what?

803
00:58:35,783 --> 00:58:39,153
Right, well, in the hour
or so before dinner--

804
00:58:39,186 --> 00:58:40,855
You mean when we were
supposed to be cloistered.

805
00:58:40,888 --> 00:58:43,758
Oh, where's the fun in that,
Mr. Walker?

806
00:58:43,791 --> 00:58:47,094
I took the liberty
of taking a tour of the house
without a guide.

807
00:58:47,128 --> 00:58:52,133
It really is
an expansive property,
full of nooks and crannies.

808
00:58:52,166 --> 00:58:55,102
Plenty of places
to hide secrets.

809
00:58:55,136 --> 00:58:57,872
And that's when
I came upon this room.

810
00:58:57,905 --> 00:58:59,040
Now, I don't know
if you've noticed,

811
00:58:59,073 --> 00:59:02,309
but there are no photographs
or portraits in the house.

812
00:59:02,343 --> 00:59:05,613
Lewis Findley was apparently
a recluse of the highest order,

813
00:59:05,646 --> 00:59:08,749
who abhorred having his likeness
taken in any way.

814
00:59:08,783 --> 00:59:12,053
I'm sure that's what sparked
your interest, right,
Mr. Walker?

815
00:59:12,086 --> 00:59:14,755
Um, yeah.
Yeah, 'cause the old man,

816
00:59:14,789 --> 00:59:20,094
he was always using
an interme... intermediary.

817
00:59:20,127 --> 00:59:21,128
You.

818
00:59:21,962 --> 00:59:24,598
I knew--
I knew you from somewhere.

819
00:59:24,632 --> 00:59:29,270
This guy-- you were his stand in
at the meeting with Carnegie
in New York, weren't you?

820
00:59:29,303 --> 00:59:31,105
[laughs]

821
00:59:31,138 --> 00:59:32,873
Which time?

822
00:59:32,907 --> 00:59:35,876
Mr. Carnegie was very fond
of his little events.

823
00:59:35,910 --> 00:59:39,713
There was always a banquet
or a dedication
that we mustn't miss.

824
00:59:39,747 --> 00:59:41,148
This is getting
a bit off topic.

825
00:59:41,182 --> 00:59:42,950
There'll be time enough
for that later.

826
00:59:42,983 --> 00:59:46,720
At the moment, we must continue
with the task at hand.

827
00:59:46,754 --> 00:59:50,658
His perceived aversion
to photographs
was not entirely accurate.

828
00:59:54,395 --> 00:59:58,032
Wow, the old man
really liked the mutt.

829
00:59:58,065 --> 01:00:01,702
Which is why he hid Blunder
in a small,

830
01:00:01,735 --> 01:00:03,771
though surprisingly
comfortable shack

831
01:00:03,804 --> 01:00:05,906
on the northernmost point
of the island.

832
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:08,209
I saw it on my way
to the cliffs.

833
01:00:08,242 --> 01:00:11,712
Poor Blunder, he just
couldn't uphold the ruse.

834
01:00:11,745 --> 01:00:14,982
And that brings me
to my last surprise.

835
01:00:15,015 --> 01:00:17,218
If you'll all follow me
to the lounge.

836
01:00:17,251 --> 01:00:20,087
This behavior
seems a bit ghoulish
given the circumstances.

837
01:00:20,121 --> 01:00:21,956
I rather like it.

838
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:27,294
Gettin' a little sick
of your games, old man.

839
01:00:33,767 --> 01:00:36,137
Alright, all settled?

840
01:00:36,170 --> 01:00:38,005
This better be good,
sweetheart.

841
01:00:38,038 --> 01:00:42,209
Miranda, please,
there have been two murders.

842
01:00:42,243 --> 01:00:43,944
We are very afraid.

843
01:00:43,978 --> 01:00:47,815
No, you're right.
I have been a bit glib.

844
01:00:47,848 --> 01:00:50,751
The truth is a man has died,

845
01:00:50,784 --> 01:00:55,422
and it's a somber occasion,
traumatic even.

846
01:00:55,456 --> 01:00:58,025
But you are wrong on one count.

847
01:00:58,058 --> 01:00:59,460
You may come in.

848
01:00:59,493 --> 01:01:02,229
[footsteps approaching]

849
01:01:09,737 --> 01:01:10,771
Hello all.

850
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:15,476
Uh, terribly sorry
about the morbid theatrics.
[chuckles]

851
01:01:15,510 --> 01:01:19,280
- I'm gonna kill you,
you no good son--
- Oh!

852
01:01:19,313 --> 01:01:20,481
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
- [Donald] Let go!

853
01:01:20,515 --> 01:01:22,349
- [Gordon] Mr. Walker.
- [Phillip] No, no!

854
01:01:22,383 --> 01:01:26,187
What a big, twisted-- damn you--
I got it, I'm fine. I'm fine.

855
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:27,888
Alright, let go. Alright.

856
01:01:29,290 --> 01:01:30,824
But you're gonna
answer some questions

857
01:01:30,858 --> 01:01:32,359
if you wanna
get off this island alive.

858
01:01:32,393 --> 01:01:35,296
That is, uh, more than fair,
all being all things considered,

859
01:01:35,329 --> 01:01:38,065
but if you'll allow me
to explain,

860
01:01:38,098 --> 01:01:41,468
you may find that I am not
completely deserving
of execution.

861
01:01:50,844 --> 01:01:54,281
Would anyone else care for one
before we begin?

862
01:01:54,315 --> 01:01:57,818
Yeah. I'll have one.

863
01:02:01,222 --> 01:02:03,057
[drink pours]

864
01:02:03,090 --> 01:02:04,792
[bottle clanging]

865
01:02:18,472 --> 01:02:19,773
[exhales]

866
01:02:21,208 --> 01:02:23,410
Right, on with the show.

867
01:02:25,012 --> 01:02:28,516
Many months ago I was approached
by Lord Findley here

868
01:02:28,550 --> 01:02:32,353
with a rather strange
proposition

869
01:02:32,386 --> 01:02:35,055
and an even stranger scheme.

870
01:02:36,290 --> 01:02:38,425
<i>Lord Findley valued his privacy</i>

871
01:02:38,459 --> 01:02:42,096
<i>above nearly all else,</i>
<i>that much is true.</i>

872
01:02:42,129 --> 01:02:44,566
<i>He never took a family,</i>

873
01:02:44,599 --> 01:02:47,868
<i>but that is not to suggest</i>
<i>he didn't seek</i>

874
01:02:47,901 --> 01:02:52,339
intimate companionship
in his day.

875
01:02:52,373 --> 01:02:57,411
In point of fact, Mr. Findley
was a bit of a lothario,
and believed himself

876
01:02:57,444 --> 01:03:00,414
<i>to have sired</i>
<i>a number of children,</i>

877
01:03:00,447 --> 01:03:04,451
<i>all of whom</i>
<i>could serve as his heirs</i>
<i>when the time came.</i>

878
01:03:05,853 --> 01:03:08,889
<i>And the hour</i>
<i>was approaching fast.</i>

879
01:03:10,525 --> 01:03:12,560
Lord Findley
was unwilling, however,

880
01:03:12,594 --> 01:03:16,196
to turn his immense fortune
over to a complete stranger,

881
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:22,236
much less so to, as he put it,
an undeserving lout.

882
01:03:23,538 --> 01:03:27,308
The man really seemed
most invested

883
01:03:27,341 --> 01:03:30,077
<i>in what would happen</i>
<i>to his holdings</i>
<i>and his business.</i>

884
01:03:31,312 --> 01:03:35,416
<i>He made it very clear,</i>
<i>"One heir".</i>

885
01:03:35,449 --> 01:03:38,252
To the rest, well... phew.

886
01:03:39,219 --> 01:03:40,387
So, off I went.

887
01:03:44,925 --> 01:03:45,959
[muted dialogue]

888
01:03:47,629 --> 01:03:52,966
Five children deemed most fit
to inherit the immense fortune.

889
01:03:53,967 --> 01:03:56,403
Five invitations.

890
01:04:12,587 --> 01:04:17,057
But that was only the beginning,
for how was Findley to choose?

891
01:04:17,091 --> 01:04:18,359
[chuckles]

892
01:04:18,392 --> 01:04:21,261
Give the old man
credit for creativity.

893
01:04:21,295 --> 01:04:23,964
He hired a pair of actors,

894
01:04:23,997 --> 01:04:26,200
that he used from time to time
as surrogates,

895
01:04:26,233 --> 01:04:29,336
to play his staff
alongside himself,

896
01:04:29,370 --> 01:04:33,608
<i>as he would adopt the role</i>
<i>of the venerable butler Sean.</i>

897
01:04:35,309 --> 01:04:38,513
But how to provoke a person,

898
01:04:38,546 --> 01:04:41,949
to reveal their true nature
in but a short weekend,

899
01:04:41,982 --> 01:04:45,620
which Findley insisted
was all he needed
to choose an heir?

900
01:04:46,621 --> 01:04:50,658
<i>I suppose a murder</i>
<i>was as good a way as any.</i>

901
01:05:00,401 --> 01:05:04,171
The rest, the lights, and such,

902
01:05:04,204 --> 01:05:08,208
were all meant to invoke
tension and unease.

903
01:05:10,244 --> 01:05:13,380
And the rabbits?

904
01:05:15,282 --> 01:05:16,483
Rabbits?

905
01:05:16,518 --> 01:05:18,952
In the woods,
there's a small shack

906
01:05:18,986 --> 01:05:21,221
with five live rabbits,
one dead.

907
01:05:21,255 --> 01:05:22,724
They looked to represent us.

908
01:05:22,757 --> 01:05:26,561
Oh, I believe they were
just meant as fresh meat
for the dog.

909
01:05:27,261 --> 01:05:31,298
Sorry it isn't
a saucier reason, my dear.
[chuckles]

910
01:05:31,331 --> 01:05:34,468
My employer was eccentric,
not insane.

911
01:05:34,501 --> 01:05:36,203
Yeah,
I don't see the difference.

912
01:05:37,171 --> 01:05:38,673
He wanted to test you.

913
01:05:40,307 --> 01:05:44,311
This, however,
wasn't part of the plan.

914
01:05:47,314 --> 01:05:52,019
Lord Findley
had fully intended to reveal
his selection tomorrow.

915
01:05:54,656 --> 01:05:58,560
I'm sorry, I truly am.

916
01:06:04,298 --> 01:06:07,134
Where are Gordon and Katherine?

917
01:06:07,167 --> 01:06:08,368
Who cares?

918
01:06:09,804 --> 01:06:11,271
They can't leave.

919
01:06:13,575 --> 01:06:15,108
About that.

920
01:06:15,142 --> 01:06:16,176
Hurry, dear!

921
01:06:16,210 --> 01:06:17,679
I'm trying!

922
01:06:17,712 --> 01:06:19,112
We must launch!

923
01:06:23,183 --> 01:06:24,351
[gasps]

924
01:06:24,384 --> 01:06:25,787
[choking]

925
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:29,122
Let him up, we'll come quietly!
Oh, do something!

926
01:06:29,156 --> 01:06:31,158
- He's going to kill him!
- Donald!

927
01:06:31,191 --> 01:06:33,193
Where were you going, huh?

928
01:06:33,227 --> 01:06:34,629
Donald, let him up right now,

929
01:06:34,662 --> 01:06:37,164
or I'll make sure you spend
the rest of your life in jail!

930
01:06:37,197 --> 01:06:39,066
[panting]

931
01:06:42,169 --> 01:06:43,538
[Miranda] Why run?

932
01:06:43,571 --> 01:06:46,641
Look, miss, it was a gig,

933
01:06:46,674 --> 01:06:48,710
and a bloody good one
at that, huh?

934
01:06:50,177 --> 01:06:51,746
Findley was a bit
of an odd fellow,

935
01:06:51,779 --> 01:06:54,749
bit cold as well,
but he took care of us,

936
01:06:54,782 --> 01:06:57,050
paid us well.

937
01:06:57,084 --> 01:07:00,187
We're not exactly
West End regulars.

938
01:07:00,220 --> 01:07:03,558
Acting gigs in London,
not exactly stable work,

939
01:07:03,591 --> 01:07:05,392
and we're not exactly
spring chickens.

940
01:07:05,425 --> 01:07:08,061
[Katherine] This isn't where
we thought we would end up,

941
01:07:08,095 --> 01:07:11,666
playing his staff,
being his emissaries.

942
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:14,802
But it's been so hard.

943
01:07:14,836 --> 01:07:17,739
We've been married for 15 years
and what do we have
to show for it?

944
01:07:17,772 --> 01:07:21,843
No children,
nary a leading role between us,

945
01:07:21,876 --> 01:07:24,144
but these past few years,
working for Mr. Findley

946
01:07:24,177 --> 01:07:25,780
allowed us to buy a house
and start--

947
01:07:25,813 --> 01:07:27,515
You're not answering
the question.

948
01:07:27,549 --> 01:07:30,652
Yeah, because they don't
have an answer to the question,

949
01:07:30,685 --> 01:07:32,486
'cause they killed the old man.

950
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:34,856
Trust me, I've seen plenty
of guilty people,

951
01:07:34,889 --> 01:07:37,124
and these two are guilty as sin.

952
01:07:37,157 --> 01:07:38,091
We didn't kill him!

953
01:07:38,125 --> 01:07:41,596
Look, let me explain.
This gig was different.

954
01:07:41,629 --> 01:07:44,464
Findley was very clear
that we should make no mistakes.

955
01:07:44,498 --> 01:07:48,736
He needed us to get the absolute
most out of each of you.

956
01:07:48,770 --> 01:07:52,306
We needed to poke, and prod,
and instigate

957
01:07:52,339 --> 01:07:55,710
as much as possible
without givin' up the game.

958
01:07:55,743 --> 01:07:59,781
And he was always there.
It was a lot of pressure.

959
01:07:59,814 --> 01:08:02,684
And then when the old man
turned up dead--

960
01:08:02,717 --> 01:08:04,151
You panicked.

961
01:08:04,184 --> 01:08:06,521
How were we going to
keep the house without...

962
01:08:08,690 --> 01:08:10,223
Oh, I'm sorry.

963
01:08:11,559 --> 01:08:13,861
You found and lost
a father today.

964
01:08:15,495 --> 01:08:16,764
It hardly compares.

965
01:08:20,467 --> 01:08:22,135
My father is Shen Wang,

966
01:08:23,337 --> 01:08:26,173
and he is alive and well
in China.

967
01:08:27,642 --> 01:08:31,144
Lewis Findley
may have known my mother,

968
01:08:31,178 --> 01:08:33,480
but he was not my father.

969
01:08:34,782 --> 01:08:36,784
Nor was he a father
to any of us.

970
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:40,521
Not a real father, anyway.

971
01:08:46,493 --> 01:08:47,829
Thank you.

972
01:08:47,862 --> 01:08:50,330
Yeah, I don't buy it.

973
01:08:50,364 --> 01:08:52,533
So-so, let me get
this straight.

974
01:08:53,568 --> 01:08:55,502
The old man croaks,

975
01:08:55,536 --> 01:08:58,271
and the two of you decide
to take off in the boat,

976
01:08:58,305 --> 01:09:03,377
leave us stuck here
on the island, all 'cause
you got panicked, huh?

977
01:09:03,410 --> 01:09:05,212
I don't buy it. Not one bit.

978
01:09:06,547 --> 01:09:08,616
I haven't forgot
about you either, missy.

979
01:09:08,650 --> 01:09:09,884
You've been skulkin'
around the house

980
01:09:09,917 --> 01:09:12,319
since you got here
like you got somethin' to hide.

981
01:09:12,352 --> 01:09:13,655
And all of a sudden,
out of the blue,

982
01:09:13,688 --> 01:09:15,188
your scarf turns up

983
01:09:15,222 --> 01:09:16,924
wrapped around
a dead guy's neck!

984
01:09:16,958 --> 01:09:18,392
This is outlandish!

985
01:09:27,401 --> 01:09:31,405
Miss Green,
talk some sense into him.

986
01:09:31,438 --> 01:09:34,509
It is hard to understand
why you would come
all the way from China

987
01:09:34,542 --> 01:09:35,910
on little more
than an invitation.

988
01:09:35,943 --> 01:09:37,879
There you go. Thank you.

989
01:09:39,847 --> 01:09:41,649
You're not off the hook either,
sweetheart.

990
01:09:41,683 --> 01:09:44,752
You're always walkin' around,
readin' your little
mystery books.

991
01:09:44,786 --> 01:09:47,555
Dreamin' of becomin'
a real detective one day.

992
01:09:47,588 --> 01:09:51,491
Then your dreams come true
and you get to solve
a real murder.

993
01:09:51,526 --> 01:09:52,560
Maybe you thought
the only thing

994
01:09:52,593 --> 01:09:55,963
better than solvin' one murder
is solvin' two, huh?

995
01:09:55,997 --> 01:09:58,900
Maybe that meant enough for you
to kill the old man yourself.

996
01:09:58,933 --> 01:10:01,736
Alright, this is
a reasonable enough theory.

997
01:10:01,769 --> 01:10:03,671
But there's more
connecting you to the murder.

998
01:10:03,705 --> 01:10:06,641
- Like what?
- You despise
the trappings of wealth,

999
01:10:06,674 --> 01:10:08,776
and we've already seen
the ferocity of your rage.

1000
01:10:08,810 --> 01:10:10,845
Oh, there it is.

1001
01:10:10,878 --> 01:10:13,313
Soon as chips are down,
you come after me every time.

1002
01:10:13,346 --> 01:10:15,616
This is getting ridiculous.

1003
01:10:15,650 --> 01:10:17,785
We know that someone
killed Mr. Findley.

1004
01:10:17,819 --> 01:10:20,888
The impostors are suspects,
as well as Mr. Walker,

1005
01:10:20,922 --> 01:10:23,958
Miss Green, and Miss Wang,
but we are talking in circles.

1006
01:10:23,991 --> 01:10:27,729
I'd say that list
is a bit short, don't you?

1007
01:10:27,762 --> 01:10:30,965
What are you implying,
Mr. Kane?

1008
01:10:30,998 --> 01:10:33,568
I could never harm anyone.

1009
01:10:40,074 --> 01:10:41,642
Phillip, tell them.

1010
01:10:41,676 --> 01:10:44,444
It's unlikely.

1011
01:10:44,478 --> 01:10:46,881
But you would do anything
to avoid returning to Seville.

1012
01:10:48,983 --> 01:10:51,786
And what of you?
Are you not above suspicion?

1013
01:10:51,819 --> 01:10:53,386
That's outrageous!

1014
01:10:53,420 --> 01:10:55,388
I am a doctor.
My job is to help and heal.

1015
01:10:55,422 --> 01:10:57,759
As though no doctor
has ever committed
nefarious deeds?

1016
01:10:57,792 --> 01:10:59,694
What of your Jack the Ripper?

1017
01:10:59,727 --> 01:11:01,662
Are there no theories
that he is a doctor?

1018
01:11:01,696 --> 01:11:04,999
One baseless theory
implicates all doctors.
Brilliant. Well done.

1019
01:11:05,032 --> 01:11:07,735
- What about H.H. Holmes?
- And Hawley Crippen.

1020
01:11:07,769 --> 01:11:10,805
Burke and Hare sold bodies
to medical schools.

1021
01:11:10,838 --> 01:11:12,740
Bodies that they stole
and murdered.

1022
01:11:12,774 --> 01:11:13,875
Morality lessons from a lawyer,

1023
01:11:13,908 --> 01:11:15,877
and a lawyer that took part
in this charade no less.

1024
01:11:15,910 --> 01:11:17,545
That's very rich
coming from you, old boy.

1025
01:11:17,578 --> 01:11:18,980
I suppose this was inevitable.

1026
01:11:19,013 --> 01:11:21,582
But since we're all passing
blame around tonight,

1027
01:11:21,616 --> 01:11:25,352
humor me, why would I kill
my employer, hmm?

1028
01:11:25,385 --> 01:11:28,488
Maybe because
you're the only one
with access to the will.

1029
01:11:28,523 --> 01:11:30,892
- What?
- If you could add one of us,

1030
01:11:30,925 --> 01:11:32,860
you could just as easily
add yourself.

1031
01:11:32,894 --> 01:11:34,294
You wouldn't even have
to take the whole fortune.

1032
01:11:34,327 --> 01:11:37,397
You could just carve off
a little piece of the estate
for yourself.

1033
01:11:37,430 --> 01:11:41,702
Well, considering I currently
don't have access to the will,
I'd say that's a faulty theory.

1034
01:11:41,736 --> 01:11:43,704
How dare you?
You are the lawyer!

1035
01:11:43,738 --> 01:11:46,707
[overlapping chatter]

1036
01:11:46,741 --> 01:11:48,509
Enough!

1037
01:11:48,543 --> 01:11:50,377
This isn't getting us anywhere.

1038
01:11:50,410 --> 01:11:53,446
We need to rest.
We'll call the police.

1039
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:55,348
They will handle this
in the morning.

1040
01:11:55,382 --> 01:11:57,317
Good idea.
[clears throat]

1041
01:12:11,866 --> 01:12:15,502
[crying]

1042

[knocking on door]

1043
01:13:30,011 --> 01:13:31,112
What?

1044
01:13:31,145 --> 01:13:32,246
I need you to come with me.

1045
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:34,815
I think that would be a bit daft
given the circumstances.

1046
01:13:34,849 --> 01:13:37,518
Wouldn't you agree,
whatever your name is?

1047
01:13:37,551 --> 01:13:39,186
Still Gordon.
That much is true.

1048
01:13:39,820 --> 01:13:42,790
If I wanted you dead,
I could force my way in.
[chuckles]

1049
01:13:47,929 --> 01:13:49,630
I need to show you something.

1050
01:13:53,668 --> 01:13:55,502
And why would I want to see it?

1051
01:13:55,536 --> 01:13:57,638
Because I think
you can find the killer.

1052
01:14:02,910 --> 01:14:07,114
You know, you had me worried
when we first met.

1053
01:14:09,250 --> 01:14:12,186
Yeah, you seemed very skilled
at detecting a lie.

1054
01:14:13,721 --> 01:14:16,557
But I suppose we all
have our parts to play.

1055
01:14:20,995 --> 01:14:23,831
And there's only one thing
left to do at this point.

1056
01:14:26,934 --> 01:14:30,470
[bell tolling]

1057
01:14:32,239 --> 01:14:33,908
Where is Miranda?

1058
01:14:35,576 --> 01:14:37,144
Where's Gordon?

1059
01:14:37,178 --> 01:14:40,581
He left in the night.

1060
01:14:40,614 --> 01:14:42,950
He said he had to take care
of something in the study.

1061
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:46,153
Oh, no.

1062
01:14:46,187 --> 01:14:48,122
[tense music playing]

1063
01:14:50,324 --> 01:14:51,959
[exhales] Friends!

1064
01:14:51,993 --> 01:14:54,695
Or should I say
brothers and sisters?

1065
01:14:54,729 --> 01:14:55,930
Where's my husband?

1066
01:14:55,963 --> 01:14:57,965
He's preparing the boat
for our departure.

1067
01:14:57,999 --> 01:15:00,901
He took it a few hours ago
to fetch Detective Church here.

1068
01:15:00,935 --> 01:15:04,305
Detective Harold Church,
Dartmouth constabulary.
Pleasure.

1069
01:15:04,338 --> 01:15:08,976
We have much to discuss.
There's a murderer in our midst.

1070
01:15:09,010 --> 01:15:10,244
Aren't you being
a little cavalier?

1071
01:15:10,277 --> 01:15:11,979
No reason for alarm, sir.

1072
01:15:17,685 --> 01:15:20,588
Alright then, shall we?

1073
01:15:22,356 --> 01:15:24,792
[lock rattling]

[Carmen] It is me.

1076
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:55,256
I can't be older than 14 here.

1077
01:15:55,289 --> 01:16:00,227
He was watching us
all this time.

1078
01:16:00,261 --> 01:16:03,097
That's just the tip
of the iceberg, I'm afraid.

1079
01:16:17,078 --> 01:16:19,046
Gordon and Katherine
weren't lying

1080
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:21,015
when they said they were
keeping an eye on us.

1081

[static buzzing]

1082
01:16:22,149 --> 01:16:24,085
So, what in the hell
am I lookin' at?

1083
01:16:27,354 --> 01:16:31,225
Cameras,
and expensive ones at that.

1084
01:16:31,258 --> 01:16:34,261
Completely state-of-the-art,
in every room,

1085
01:16:34,295 --> 01:16:36,630
with this nifty little feature
that logs footage

1086
01:16:36,664 --> 01:16:39,166
- and replays it.
- Impossible.

1087
01:16:43,104 --> 01:16:47,108
[Gordon] <i>Findley had connections</i>
<i>with both the American</i>
<i>and British military,</i>

1088
01:16:47,141 --> 01:16:48,375

1089
01:16:48,409 --> 01:16:51,812
<i>One day the whole apparatus</i>

<i>He showed me how to operate it,</i>

1092
01:16:57,418 --> 01:17:00,721
<i>but he never said where</i>
<i>he obtained such technology.</i>

1093
01:17:06,093 --> 01:17:08,095
I first suspected
something was off

1094
01:17:08,129 --> 01:17:10,898
when I could hear Carmen
scream through the walls.

1095
01:17:10,931 --> 01:17:14,902
Even if the claims
of soundproofing
were a lie meant to scare,

1096
01:17:14,935 --> 01:17:18,105
a house as sturdy as this
should dampen the sound
a bit better,

1097
01:17:18,139 --> 01:17:21,775
but Findley had a whole network
of hallways behind these walls.

1098
01:17:21,809 --> 01:17:24,411
So, you saw the killer?

1099
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:28,282
This is ridiculous.
I'm leavin'.

1100
01:17:28,315 --> 01:17:30,417
I'm afraid I can't let you
do that, my good man.

1101
01:17:30,451 --> 01:17:31,852
I'm sure you understand.

1102

[Miranda]
The surveillance yielded

1103
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:35,322
a treasure trove of information,

1104
01:17:35,356 --> 01:17:38,092
but I'm sure
you'd all like some context.

1105
01:17:41,762 --> 01:17:46,267
You know, working with roses,
one becomes desensitized
to such wounds,

1106
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:49,937
which I'm sure is something
that you have experienced,
Mr. Kane.

1107
01:17:56,143 --> 01:17:57,878
Hazards of the job.

1108
01:17:57,912 --> 01:18:03,150
And, Findley insisted on
rehearsing multiple scenarios

1109
01:18:03,184 --> 01:18:06,854
before choosing exactly
how I was to be murdered.

1110
01:18:08,122 --> 01:18:10,324
Your father's hands
weren't terribly steady.

1111
01:18:14,428 --> 01:18:16,931
How could he
treat his friends so poorly?

1112
01:18:16,964 --> 01:18:18,899
Men that rich
don't mix with staff.

1113
01:18:18,933 --> 01:18:22,970
I should take offense,
but spot on, old boy.

1114
01:18:24,438 --> 01:18:26,907
As I'm sure you know our father
was quite the traveler,

1115
01:18:26,941 --> 01:18:29,743
and he made sure
to document his adventures,

1116
01:18:29,777 --> 01:18:33,047
even his dalliances.
Liu Chan.

1117
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:34,782
My mother.

1118
01:18:34,815 --> 01:18:36,217
Esme Blanco.

1119
01:18:36,917 --> 01:18:37,952
And mine.

1120
01:18:39,987 --> 01:18:41,088
Please don't.

1121
01:18:43,224 --> 01:18:46,060
Naturally, my mother was here.

1122
01:18:46,093 --> 01:18:47,928
But one name was missing.

1123
01:18:47,962 --> 01:18:52,032
No Walkers, no Americans,
nothing of the sort.

1124
01:18:52,066 --> 01:18:56,136
But there was one name
that appears again and again:
Shelby.

1125
01:18:56,170 --> 01:19:00,441
She was the first,
a maid who worked on the estate,

1126
01:19:00,474 --> 01:19:03,545
and apparently she left
quite an impact on Findley.

1127
01:19:03,578 --> 01:19:07,481
The first few pages
are documented meticulously,

1128
01:19:07,515 --> 01:19:09,817
and with a romantic fervor
that Findley

1129
01:19:09,850 --> 01:19:12,953
seemed unable to access
for anything else in his life.

1130
01:19:14,221 --> 01:19:17,791
Shelby and her child.

1131
01:19:17,825 --> 01:19:23,897
For you see, the maid
had a child, a boy.

1132
01:19:38,012 --> 01:19:40,381
Detective, will you check
his breast pocket?

1133
01:19:41,482 --> 01:19:43,217
Steady now, big fellow.

1134
01:20:02,436 --> 01:20:06,373
Yes. Shelby Walker
and Lewis Findley.

1135
01:20:08,275 --> 01:20:10,411
I'm afraid
this doesn't prove much.

1136
01:20:10,444 --> 01:20:12,413
Just wait.

1137
01:20:22,256 --> 01:20:24,124
[Donald]
He said he'd marry her.

1138
01:20:26,126 --> 01:20:27,828
Over and over and over.

1139
01:20:30,130 --> 01:20:36,403
So, she waited, and waited
for him to tell his parents.

1140
01:20:37,371 --> 01:20:40,007
She was young, she had time.

1141
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:41,942
But then she got pregnant...

1142
01:20:45,012 --> 01:20:46,880
and that changed everything.

1143
01:20:49,249 --> 01:20:53,087
Said he had no choice
but to fire her.

1144
01:20:55,523 --> 01:20:58,425
And she got-- she got nothing...

1145
01:21:00,662 --> 01:21:03,997
because payouts raise questions.

1146
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:10,037
So, she had-- [sniffles]
she had nowhere to go.

1147
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:15,142
Her own family
wouldn't let her in,

1148
01:21:15,175 --> 01:21:20,515
because she was unmarried
and carrying a...

1149
01:21:21,982 --> 01:21:25,653
a bastard son.

1150
01:21:25,687 --> 01:21:29,657
So, she moved to the States.

1151
01:21:31,992 --> 01:21:33,561
She had me on the boat.

1152
01:21:35,162 --> 01:21:36,997
She always clung to this hope

1153
01:21:37,030 --> 01:21:42,035
that... that one-day Findley
would come for her.

1154
01:21:43,605 --> 01:21:46,407
We would live
in the lap of luxury.

1155
01:21:47,975 --> 01:21:51,445
She refused to find
any permanent work,

1156
01:21:51,478 --> 01:21:56,984
because she was sure
that any day now,
her prince would come.

1157
01:21:57,017 --> 01:22:00,020
She'd say,
"Daddy will come save us."

1158
01:22:03,290 --> 01:22:04,526
Daddy.

1159
01:22:07,762 --> 01:22:09,363
Then she got sick.

1160
01:22:12,534 --> 01:22:16,671
So sick that she swallowed
her pride and she...

1161
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:23,410
she wrote Findley a letter,
begging for help.

1162
01:22:26,714 --> 01:22:28,949
Not a word.

1163
01:22:31,084 --> 01:22:32,687
And she made sure
that I knew the truth

1164
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:36,423
about Findley before she died.

1165
01:22:36,457 --> 01:22:39,126
And when her day came...

1166
01:22:40,728 --> 01:22:43,130
that was there
that I vowed that...

1167
01:22:45,265 --> 01:22:47,769
I would come after Findley

1168
01:22:47,802 --> 01:22:51,004
and everyone like him
for the rest of my life.

1169
01:22:54,208 --> 01:22:56,043
[sniffles]
See, the rich and powerful,

1170
01:22:56,076 --> 01:23:01,549
they know that information
can do more harm

1171
01:23:01,583 --> 01:23:06,086
than any-any knife or pistol.

1172
01:23:06,119 --> 01:23:09,189
So, I became
a hunter of secrets.

1173
01:23:11,158 --> 01:23:14,094
I would find their sins
and I would drag 'em out

1174
01:23:14,127 --> 01:23:17,699
into the cold light of day
for everyone to see.

1175
01:23:17,732 --> 01:23:20,067
He watched your every move.

1176
01:23:27,474 --> 01:23:28,610
[Donald] Those...

1177
01:23:32,179 --> 01:23:33,681
those are my stories.

1178
01:23:33,715 --> 01:23:37,050
It's all in the journal.
He was terribly proud of you.

1179
01:23:38,352 --> 01:23:40,387
He didn't care much
for your politics,

1180
01:23:40,420 --> 01:23:42,757
but your drive,
your relentlessness.

1181
01:23:42,790 --> 01:23:45,425
You were everything
he wanted in an heir,

1182
01:23:45,459 --> 01:23:47,127
'cause you were just like him.

1183
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:49,429
I was nothing like him!

1184
01:23:49,463 --> 01:23:51,131
I mean, look around.

1185
01:23:51,164 --> 01:23:55,302
He just left us all
to struggle and survive,

1186
01:23:55,335 --> 01:23:58,071
while he watched us
from his gilded towers.

1187
01:23:58,105 --> 01:24:02,209
And at any time, he could have
eased our suffering, but, nope.

1188
01:24:03,745 --> 01:24:06,046
He has let us twist
in the wind.

1189
01:24:07,447 --> 01:24:11,184
And then when that time
came in his life

1190
01:24:11,218 --> 01:24:13,555
to do the right thing
and let us in...

1191
01:24:17,291 --> 01:24:18,560
more games.

1192
01:24:22,329 --> 01:24:27,301
So, I did the one thing
that that man, that--

1193
01:24:27,334 --> 01:24:31,773
that coward didn't have
the decency to do.

1194
01:24:31,806 --> 01:24:33,373
I stopped the game.

1195
01:24:34,709 --> 01:24:36,276
By killing him?

1196
01:24:36,310 --> 01:24:38,178
By doing what was necessary.

1197
01:24:38,211 --> 01:24:39,413
By framing me.

1198
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:43,618
By blaming Gordon, then Miranda,
and when that didn't work,

1199
01:24:43,651 --> 01:24:45,753
making sure we blamed
one another,

1200
01:24:45,787 --> 01:24:47,722
so that you could slip away.

1201
01:24:50,190 --> 01:24:53,293
You are the real coward!

1202
01:24:53,327 --> 01:24:54,461
Well...

1203
01:24:55,863 --> 01:24:59,299
I guess I got a bit
of the old man in me after all.

1204
01:25:04,204 --> 01:25:06,340
But y'all should be thanking me.

1205
01:25:07,775 --> 01:25:10,712
I set you free.
That money is cursed.

1206
01:25:10,745 --> 01:25:13,280
For four of us,
there is the utter degradation

1207
01:25:13,313 --> 01:25:15,550
of being told to our face
by Findley

1208
01:25:15,583 --> 01:25:16,818
that we're just not good enough.

1209
01:25:19,219 --> 01:25:22,790
And then for
the one lucky winner...

1210
01:25:24,926 --> 01:25:29,229
it's a worse fate
to be locked in a cage

1211
01:25:29,262 --> 01:25:33,233
and turned into a cheap
facsimile of him.

1212
01:25:33,266 --> 01:25:35,168
[Miranda]
That's not exactly true.

1213
01:25:35,202 --> 01:25:37,437
This was never a game
of choosing.

1214
01:25:38,740 --> 01:25:40,675
This was due diligence.

1215
01:25:40,708 --> 01:25:42,677
It was always
going to be you, Donald.

1216
01:25:43,711 --> 01:25:46,380
This was just a test to vet you.

1217
01:25:46,413 --> 01:25:48,516
We were never serious options.

1218
01:25:48,549 --> 01:25:51,485
And now, it will be no one.

1219
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:55,623
The inheritance
should be divided equally

1220
01:25:55,657 --> 01:25:57,625
amongst his children.
Is that not the law?

1221
01:25:57,659 --> 01:26:01,228
Possibly, but the will
was very specific

1222
01:26:01,261 --> 01:26:03,463
that should an heir
not be chosen,

1223
01:26:03,497 --> 01:26:06,333
all assets would be returned
to Findley Industries

1224
01:26:06,366 --> 01:26:08,936
and a successor
be appointed by the board.

1225
01:26:08,970 --> 01:26:15,710
If an heir were chosen, however,
all would be well taken care of.

1226
01:26:15,743 --> 01:26:18,780
Though you'd be forced to
relinquish your names,

1227
01:26:18,813 --> 01:26:21,983
sworn to secrecy under threat
of losing your buyouts.

1228
01:26:22,016 --> 01:26:24,418
Games on top of games.

1229
01:26:25,452 --> 01:26:27,254
Take him away, Detective.

1230
01:26:50,978 --> 01:26:52,814
I'm terribly sorry.

1231
01:26:52,847 --> 01:26:56,249
Had I known the depths
of his sadism,

1232
01:26:56,283 --> 01:26:58,853
I never would have partook.

1233
01:26:58,886 --> 01:27:00,922
He would have found
someone else.

1234
01:27:05,727 --> 01:27:08,428
Our father
does not define our worth,

1235
01:27:08,462 --> 01:27:10,031
nor does our station.

1236
01:27:10,064 --> 01:27:13,000
We are the masters
of our own fate.

1237
01:27:15,036 --> 01:27:19,640
- We don't need him.
- Or his money.

1238
01:27:19,674 --> 01:27:21,509
Because we have each other.

1239
01:27:23,310 --> 01:27:24,579
[chuckles]

1240
01:27:30,651 --> 01:27:32,787
[birds squawking]

1241
01:27:41,461 --> 01:27:43,064
What's going to happen to him?

1242
01:27:43,097 --> 01:27:44,932
It should be
an open and shut case.

1243
01:27:44,966 --> 01:27:47,001
He'll spend the rest
of his life in a cell.

1244
01:27:47,034 --> 01:27:48,502
What a waste.

1245
01:27:48,536 --> 01:27:51,873
Oh, you're too kind.

1246
01:27:51,906 --> 01:27:54,742
And that's why you'll never be
a detective, sweetheart.

1247
01:27:54,776 --> 01:27:57,612
That compassion
is why I caught you,

1248
01:27:57,645 --> 01:27:59,647
and it's why
I'll catch more like you.

1249
01:28:00,648 --> 01:28:02,382
And don't call me "sweetheart."

1250
01:28:02,415 --> 01:28:04,417
Be seein' you, sis.

1251
01:28:06,353 --> 01:28:10,725
Miss, wait.
You've got a gift for this.

1252
01:28:10,758 --> 01:28:12,459
If you ever need a hand
getting started,

1253
01:28:12,492 --> 01:28:14,028
I have mates at Scotland Yard.

1254
01:28:14,061 --> 01:28:16,664
Oh, thank you.

1255
01:28:16,697 --> 01:28:19,534
But I think my services
are better utilized on my own.

1256
01:28:19,567 --> 01:28:21,769
Oh, like a private detective?
Uh, the money--

1257
01:28:21,803 --> 01:28:24,504
Oh, I've never had
much use for money,

1258
01:28:24,539 --> 01:28:28,576
but I would like to be
of service to people
who truly need it.

1259
01:28:28,609 --> 01:28:30,511
Still, I'll take this.

1260
01:28:30,545 --> 01:28:32,780
Even a good detective
needs help from time to time.

1261
01:28:32,814 --> 01:28:34,347
[chuckles]
Right you are, miss.

1262
01:28:34,381 --> 01:28:35,616
And I'll make sure
the world knows

1263
01:28:35,650 --> 01:28:37,685
that the woman who found
Lewis Findley's killer

1264
01:28:37,718 --> 01:28:38,853
is open for business.

1265
01:28:38,886 --> 01:28:40,655
Thank you, sir.

1266
01:28:44,058 --> 01:28:46,694
I was thinking about us.

1267
01:28:47,128 --> 01:28:48,663
As was I.

1268
01:28:49,897 --> 01:28:52,066
Just because
we can't be together,

1269
01:28:52,099 --> 01:28:54,635
doesn't mean we can't be
in each other's lives.

1270
01:28:56,904 --> 01:28:59,372
I've never had
a little brother before.

1271
01:28:59,406 --> 01:29:02,442
- I'm not that young.
- [chuckles]

1272
01:29:02,475 --> 01:29:05,012
Darling, it's a joke.

1273
01:29:09,482 --> 01:29:10,918
[barking]

1274
01:29:12,653 --> 01:29:14,421
[whimpering]

1275
01:29:14,454 --> 01:29:16,423
I suppose he abandoned you, too.

1276
01:29:18,192 --> 01:29:21,596
Well, why don't you join
our collection of lost things?

1277
01:29:21,629 --> 01:29:23,363
We need to look out
for each other.

1278
01:29:26,667 --> 01:29:28,501
