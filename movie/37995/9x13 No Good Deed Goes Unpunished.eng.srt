1
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:04,414
E. R.

2
00:00:04,515 --> 00:00:06,137
Previously on E. R.

3
00:00:07,281 --> 00:00:09,693
Could you please slow down?
Luka!

4
00:00:09,894 --> 00:00:11,722
- You need structure and stability.
- Let go.

5
00:00:11,723 --> 00:00:15,328
- Someone you can rely on and trust.
- That's not you anymore, okay?

6
00:00:15,429 --> 00:00:18,483
Syphilis is not a word
the voters love to hear.

7
00:00:18,584 --> 00:00:20,996
Any way we can keep it
out of my medical record?

8
00:00:21,197 --> 00:00:23,856
- The alderman? Did we ever get his labs back?
- They' re negative.

9
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:27,428
- He could have untreated syphilis.
- He's fine. Let it go.

10
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:29,588
Looks like you could use
new equipment around here.

11
00:00:29,889 --> 00:00:32,615
- What's this? White liberal guilt?
- Probably.

12
00:00:33,637 --> 00:00:35,280
No thanks.

13
00:00:35,381 --> 00:00:38,274
He survived a 9 mm bullet to the brain.

14
00:00:38,475 --> 00:00:40,497
His IQ dropped about 40 points.

15
00:00:40,698 --> 00:00:43,371
What were you doing with those boys?
Didn't they hurt you?

16
00:00:43,472 --> 00:00:45,136
Hey, let me talk to you for a minute.

17
00:00:45,137 --> 00:00:48,229
Stay away from him. You understand that?

18
00:00:49,006 --> 00:00:50,251
9x13 "NO GOOD DEED GOES
UNPUNISHED"

19
00:00:50,424 --> 00:00:52,962
He tried climbing a giant ficus
in our living room.

20
00:00:53,135 --> 00:00:54,760
Sit back.

21
00:00:55,179 --> 00:00:57,883
No biting. Bad monkey.

22
00:00:58,057 --> 00:01:00,927
His psychiatrist says letting
Zavery act out his impulses...

23
00:01:01,101 --> 00:01:03,936
- ... allows him to express himself.
- Is he on any medication?

24
00:01:04,104 --> 00:01:07,556
He has an asthma inhaler he hasn't
been using in the last couple of days...

25
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:09,975
...since he entered
his simian role-playing phase.

26
00:01:10,152 --> 00:01:13,272
Could you help me?
Six-foot fall, possible corneal abrasion.

27
00:01:13,447 --> 00:01:16,116
Yeah, put him in Exam 2.
I'll be there in a minute.

28
00:01:17,367 --> 00:01:20,701
How are you doing, Aidan? You know
that opening goes in the back, right?

29
00:01:20,871 --> 00:01:22,330
Right.

30
00:01:22,623 --> 00:01:25,659
- Oh, you' re a wrestler.
- Yeah.

31
00:01:25,834 --> 00:01:29,120
- Seems to be working for you.
- Thanks.

32
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:33,132
- What do you do?
- I'm a doctor.

33
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,877
No, I mean to stay in shape.

34
00:01:35,052 --> 00:01:37,293
Oh, I- I do these:

35
00:01:37,471 --> 00:01:39,962
Bicep curls? How much?

36
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,548
Sometimes I can lift
a whole pitcher of margaritas.

37
00:01:42,726 --> 00:01:47,139
- Bastards. From the cigarettes, isn't it?
- Probably.

38
00:01:47,314 --> 00:01:50,019
The biopsy reveals
small-cell carcinoma.

39
00:01:50,192 --> 00:01:53,395
The x-rays show metastatic spread.

40
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,646
I need you to write me up
a full disclosure...

41
00:01:55,822 --> 00:01:58,823
...so I can file a lawsuit
against tobacco companies.

42
00:01:58,992 --> 00:02:02,527
Mr. Carmichael, you've been smoking
cigarettes since you were a teenager.

43
00:02:02,704 --> 00:02:03,949
So?

44
00:02:04,122 --> 00:02:06,696
So you need to take
some responsibility for that.

45
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:08,867
Instead of looking
for someone to blame...

46
00:02:09,044 --> 00:02:11,617
...you should be concentrating
on managing your disease.

47
00:02:11,796 --> 00:02:14,963
- Make the most of the time you have.
- I get it.

48
00:02:15,133 --> 00:02:18,668
This is just the HMOs and big business
covering each other's asses.

49
00:02:18,845 --> 00:02:21,632
Well, screw you, pal.
I'll see you in court.

50
00:02:21,806 --> 00:02:23,764
- No, you won't.
- Oh, yeah?

51
00:02:23,933 --> 00:02:28,062
- You don't think I won't sue you too?
- You're not gonna live that long.

52
00:02:29,022 --> 00:02:31,264
- What's that all about?
- Stupidity.

53
00:02:31,441 --> 00:02:34,477
- On whose part? His or yours?
- What is it with this country?

54
00:02:34,652 --> 00:02:38,401
Nobody takes responsibility for anything.
Always looking for someone to blame...

55
00:02:38,573 --> 00:02:41,907
- ... someone to sue.
- You don't like it, go back to Croatia.

56
00:02:42,076 --> 00:02:45,528
Not near as many lawyers.
Lot more landmines though.

57
00:02:45,705 --> 00:02:48,955
Twenty-two-year-old female,
hand injury. BP, 90/60, pulse, 110.

58
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,584
- What's her name?
- Brenda Walton.

59
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:55,046
- Weaver!
- Hey, don't start, Robert. I got a full-

60
00:02:56,216 --> 00:02:59,631
Who knew you were such a conniving,
manipulative seductress? Well, I did.

61
00:02:59,802 --> 00:03:02,210
- You outdid yourself.
- What are you talking about?

62
00:03:02,388 --> 00:03:05,722
We were just allotted $2.4 million
in new funding.

63
00:03:05,892 --> 00:03:07,386
- What?
- Remember Alderman Bright?

64
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,431
He was here a couple of weeks ago.
Somehow your team managed...

65
00:03:10,605 --> 00:03:12,763
...to not kill him.
I'm as surprised as you are.

66
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,732
He must have been impressed
with County.

67
00:03:14,901 --> 00:03:18,067
Either that or the prostate massage.
He's coming by this afternoon-

68
00:03:18,237 --> 00:03:19,482
This afternoon?

69
00:03:19,655 --> 00:03:22,360
For a photo op. So make sure
you groom these degenerates...

70
00:03:22,533 --> 00:03:24,490
- ... before he gets here.
- These patients...

71
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,745
- ... are why we' re getting this funding.
- Don't ruin this for me.

72
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,707
Open up, G! Open up!

73
00:03:33,169 --> 00:03:34,414
Use your key.

74
00:03:34,629 --> 00:03:37,795
I don't have it! Come on,
it's an emergency!

75
00:03:37,965 --> 00:03:41,548
- All right, all right. Stop pounding! Stop!
- G!

76
00:03:43,221 --> 00:03:45,676
- What?
- Get your doctor's stuff. Biz hurt.

77
00:03:45,848 --> 00:03:47,757
- He's hurt bad.
- What happened to him?

78
00:03:47,934 --> 00:03:49,048
I got shot, man.

79
00:03:49,226 --> 00:03:52,097
- Who shot him?
- I don't know. It happened so fast.

80
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:55,806
- Fix him up, G. Like you fixed me.
- I can't. He has a chest wound.

81
00:03:55,983 --> 00:03:58,272
I have to get him to the hospital
and call 911.

82
00:03:58,486 --> 00:04:01,652
- Yo, no hospitals. They'll be looking.
- Who, the police?

83
00:04:01,822 --> 00:04:04,230
- What the hell happened, Leon?
- It was an accident.

84
00:04:04,408 --> 00:04:07,030
We were gonna take beer and stuff
from the liquor store.

85
00:04:07,203 --> 00:04:10,038
- This was a robbery?
- But the security guard showed up...

86
00:04:10,206 --> 00:04:13,207
- ... and people just started shooting.
- Go inside, close the door.

87
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,285
Don't come out.
Don't look out the window.

88
00:04:15,461 --> 00:04:19,790
Anybody comes by, don't answer
the door. Do you understand me? Leon?!

89
00:05:11,892 --> 00:05:14,217
I like to see med students
hitting the books.

90
00:05:14,394 --> 00:05:18,344
- What are you reading?
- Tintinalli. Acute abdominal pain.

91
00:05:18,565 --> 00:05:22,266
Tintinalli? Read Zachary Cope's
Early Diagnosis of the Acute Abdomen.

92
00:05:22,444 --> 00:05:25,480
He wrote it 80 years ago,
and nothing has changed.

93
00:05:28,325 --> 00:05:29,700
Damn it.

94
00:05:30,827 --> 00:05:32,405
You-? You okay, sir?

95
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:35,497
Yeah, I'm fine. No, I got it. I got it.

96
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:39,244
All right, I'll- I'll get Housekeeping
to mop it up.

97
00:05:46,551 --> 00:05:50,929
- Please, just get it off.
- We will. Just try and relax, Brenda.

98
00:05:51,097 --> 00:05:55,142
Okay, let's start with 10 of morphine
and a gram of Ancef.

99
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,727
She was demonstrating the cruelty
of fur trapping at the university.

100
00:05:58,897 --> 00:06:01,684
- Good thing you didn't try to chew it off.
- Was that a joke?

101
00:06:01,858 --> 00:06:05,642
Do you know how many animals suffer
needless, painful deaths every year...

102
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,647
...in the name of the fur trade?

103
00:06:07,947 --> 00:06:10,439
- Will you help me open this?
- Sure.

104
00:06:12,327 --> 00:06:16,111
So, what's it gonna be?
Chechnya or the Congo?

105
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:19,826
Still thinking about it.

106
00:06:20,543 --> 00:06:22,832
- Thinking about what?
- Carter's going away...

107
00:06:23,004 --> 00:06:25,625
...with the Alliance
de Médicine Internationale.

108
00:06:26,132 --> 00:06:27,840
Really?

109
00:06:29,427 --> 00:06:32,214
- I'm thinking of doing it for the spring.
- No, he's going.

110
00:06:32,388 --> 00:06:36,256
I've done it three times.
It makes what we do here look like-

111
00:06:36,434 --> 00:06:37,762
- I don't know-
- Got this?

112
00:06:38,269 --> 00:06:40,178
Yeah, thanks.

113
00:06:43,816 --> 00:06:45,524
I'll be right back.

114
00:06:46,653 --> 00:06:49,856
I've been doing P.T. every day
since I came out of surgery.

115
00:06:50,031 --> 00:06:51,525
Recovery ebbs and flows.

116
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:54,700
Patience and attitude
can be just as important during rehab-

117
00:06:54,869 --> 00:06:57,538
Don't give me that crap.
I'm losing the strength I had.

118
00:06:57,705 --> 00:07:00,576
- And sensory function is non-existent.
- What do you want?

119
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,374
Your limb was severed.

120
00:07:02,543 --> 00:07:05,330
I'm not some schmuck
worried about how to hold his beer...

121
00:07:05,505 --> 00:07:08,209
...while he whacks away
watching TV. I want my arm back.

122
00:07:08,382 --> 00:07:11,502
It's a miracle of modern medicine
that you have what you do.

123
00:07:13,346 --> 00:07:15,006
Chechnya?

124
00:07:15,181 --> 00:07:17,886
Yeah, we talked about this.

125
00:07:18,226 --> 00:07:20,551
- No, we didn't.
- Remember when I said I thought...

126
00:07:20,728 --> 00:07:22,886
- ... I'd like to practice medicine abroad?
- Yeah.

127
00:07:23,064 --> 00:07:25,306
- Well...
- I thought you meant Paris or something.

128
00:07:25,483 --> 00:07:27,974
- Well they desperately need doctors.
- So do we.

129
00:07:28,152 --> 00:07:29,860
What's that stink?

130
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:32,734
Dr. Lewis got hit with flying feces.

131
00:07:32,907 --> 00:07:36,358
You know, I find a clipboard
is a good shield for projectile body fluid.

132
00:07:36,535 --> 00:07:38,777
Thanks for the tip and for the sweater.

133
00:07:38,954 --> 00:07:42,454
Abby, can you set up a Wood's lamp
for my monkey boy's corneal abrasion?

134
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:45,460
- He's still armed and dangerous?
- I think he's out of ammo.

135
00:07:45,628 --> 00:07:48,748
- Dr. Carter, your doctor friend's in triage.
- McNulty?

136
00:07:48,923 --> 00:07:51,924
- Must have wandered in. Seems altered.
- Doreen Brant, 32...

137
00:07:52,093 --> 00:07:53,966
...took a header down a flight of stairs.

138
00:07:54,136 --> 00:07:56,592
Abby, can you give this to Luka?
I have to change.

139
00:07:56,764 --> 00:07:59,931
- Sure. Curtain 3.
- BP, 124/72, pulse, 96.

140
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,259
- Is he here?
- Who?

141
00:08:02,436 --> 00:08:05,188
Sutter, one of our guys.
Was shot during a robbery attempt.

142
00:08:05,356 --> 00:08:07,432
- They said they'd bring him here.
- Frank?

143
00:08:07,608 --> 00:08:11,024
Got a shooting victim en route.
Nobody said he was a cop.

144
00:08:11,195 --> 00:08:12,938
Maybe they brought him
in a squad car.

145
00:08:13,113 --> 00:08:14,773
- Can you check Dispatch?
- I'm on it.

146
00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:16,775
Who summoned a surgical consult?

147
00:08:16,951 --> 00:08:18,196
You' re here for a consult?

148
00:08:18,369 --> 00:08:21,738
No, I heard Weaver was teaching a
Jazzercise class in the ambulance bay.

149
00:08:21,914 --> 00:08:25,746
I didn't know you were doing this again.
You don't have to jump all over me.

150
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:29,868
- Wouldn't think of it.
- Aidan Fenwick, this is Dr. Romano.

151
00:08:30,047 --> 00:08:33,332
Aidan developed a gluteal abscess
on his right buttock.

152
00:08:35,677 --> 00:08:37,469
I'll say. Been using steroids?

153
00:08:38,097 --> 00:08:39,591
- I was.
- He stopped.

154
00:08:39,765 --> 00:08:43,715
Not soon enough. If you like having testicles
bigger than raisins, don't restart.

155
00:08:43,894 --> 00:08:46,978
I was going to drain it, but I felt
a deep perirectal component.

156
00:08:47,147 --> 00:08:49,555
We know what a pain
in the ass that is. Good call.

157
00:08:49,733 --> 00:08:52,141
Your infection has spread up
along your rectum...

158
00:08:52,319 --> 00:08:54,608
...so we' re gonna be taking you
up to the O. R.

159
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:57,105
- I need surgery?
- We gotta clean out the infection.

160
00:08:57,282 --> 00:08:58,313
We can't do it here.

161
00:08:58,492 --> 00:09:00,615
- Do you want me to get Corday?
- No, I got this.

162
00:09:00,786 --> 00:09:04,451
- Who's gonna do the actual surgery?
- I will supervise one of my Residents.

163
00:09:04,623 --> 00:09:06,865
- Give me a hand.
- Yeah, that's why I was worried.

164
00:09:07,042 --> 00:09:10,043
Officer Jason Sutter, 39.
BP's holding at 100/74 after two liters.

165
00:09:10,212 --> 00:09:12,500
- How many times was he hit?
- Two that I can see.

166
00:09:12,673 --> 00:09:16,504
I heard four shots, felt two hits,
. 22,. 25 caliber.

167
00:09:16,676 --> 00:09:20,128
- Hurts all the way down my leg.
- Pulse is 106. Gave him eight of MS.

168
00:09:20,305 --> 00:09:24,054
- Any pain in your chest or head?
- No. Hey, somebody call Jenny.

169
00:09:24,226 --> 00:09:26,633
You can call in a few minutes.
Hang in there, Hoss.

170
00:09:26,812 --> 00:09:29,100
Hey, Susan, page Corday.

171
00:09:29,773 --> 00:09:32,524
- He's oriented times two.
- Dr. McNulty?

172
00:09:32,692 --> 00:09:36,227
- Hey, Mac, do you know where you are?
- I got patients.

173
00:09:36,404 --> 00:09:37,815
He might be in DKA.

174
00:09:37,989 --> 00:09:41,572
Let's bolus a liter of saline.
CBC, Chem-7, serum ketones and UA.

175
00:09:41,743 --> 00:09:44,744
- He's got a pulse, 130, BP, 90/60.
- Mac, have you been vomiting?

176
00:09:44,913 --> 00:09:46,573
- Do you have a fever?
- Just a cold.

177
00:09:46,748 --> 00:09:48,954
- Another hot GSW rolling in.
- Be right there.

178
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:51,248
- Accu-Chek is over 400.
- Damn it.

179
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:55,417
Okay, you have to stop jumping around,
Zavery. Zavery. Za-

180
00:09:56,216 --> 00:09:59,086
- Where's Mom?
- She had to make a phone call.

181
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:02,712
Yeah, to the adoption agency
if she's smart.

182
00:10:03,098 --> 00:10:04,889
Proparacaine drops are in. Zavery?

183
00:10:05,266 --> 00:10:07,473
Would you please come out now?

184
00:10:08,269 --> 00:10:11,270
Forget it. I can't use the "gorilla-scope"
if he won't come out.

185
00:10:11,439 --> 00:10:13,099
Oh, right.

186
00:10:13,274 --> 00:10:15,600
We'll have to bring it back to the zoo.

187
00:10:16,528 --> 00:10:19,943
Zavery, can you lie still while
we look in your eye?

188
00:10:20,406 --> 00:10:21,438
Okay.

189
00:10:22,116 --> 00:10:23,445
Okay.

190
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:28,286
I'm going to put some yellow banana
medicine in your eye...

191
00:10:28,539 --> 00:10:32,407
- ... and see if you scratched it.
- Okay, now blink your eye.

192
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:34,793
All right.

193
00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:38,544
No corneal abrasions.

194
00:10:38,716 --> 00:10:40,508
No signs of scratching.

195
00:10:40,677 --> 00:10:42,254
- Susan?
- What?

196
00:10:42,428 --> 00:10:44,220
Your sweater.

197
00:10:44,472 --> 00:10:45,883
Oh, my God.

198
00:10:46,474 --> 00:10:49,594
- Is that semen?
- This isn't my sweater.

199
00:10:51,479 --> 00:10:53,353
Oh, gross.

200
00:10:54,315 --> 00:10:58,479
Twenty-two-year-old African-American
male, gunshot wound to the left chest.

201
00:11:00,071 --> 00:11:03,570
Parasternal GSW to the third left
intercostal space. Tubed for resps.

202
00:11:03,741 --> 00:11:05,947
- What are you doing with this?
- I found him.

203
00:11:06,118 --> 00:11:09,570
I'm being a Good Samaritan.
You got a problem with that?

204
00:11:09,747 --> 00:11:13,792
Pulse is up to 110 with two liters.
He needs a chest tube.

205
00:11:15,127 --> 00:11:17,583
- This guy a friend of yours?
- We' re not all related.

206
00:11:17,755 --> 00:11:22,298
He's tachy at 120. Let's type and cross
4 units and get two units of O-neg going.

207
00:11:23,427 --> 00:11:26,547
All right, sterile gloves, prep
the left side. I need a Thora-Seal.

208
00:11:26,722 --> 00:11:28,216
Pulse ox, 95 on 100 percent.

209
00:11:28,391 --> 00:11:31,345
Pupils are four millimeters and reactive.
What's his name?

210
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,057
- I don't know. Cop's got his wallet.
- Biz Cummins.

211
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,890
Biz, can you hear me?

212
00:11:36,107 --> 00:11:38,479
- What's with all the boys in blue?
- Cop got shot.

213
00:11:38,651 --> 00:11:42,862
- Might have been this guy right here.
- Neck veins flat. No signs of tamponade.

214
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,946
- I'll do the lines. Seven and a half.
- I've two criticals coming.

215
00:11:51,121 --> 00:11:52,995
I'll need someone
from vascular surgery.

216
00:11:53,165 --> 00:11:55,122
Did you get a look at the guy
who shot you?

217
00:11:55,292 --> 00:11:57,783
There were three.
I don't know who pulled the trigger.

218
00:11:57,962 --> 00:12:00,535
How long is that gonna take?
No. No, that's unacceptable.

219
00:12:00,714 --> 00:12:03,881
- Someone take this bloody phone.
- What about the guy next door?

220
00:12:04,051 --> 00:12:06,803
- Doc, can you move for a second?
- Can't you see I'm busy...

221
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:09,722
- ... trying to save the guy?
- He may have shot this officer.

222
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:13,341
- He's not going anywhere. Dori?
- But his two buddies are on the loose.

223
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,306
Blood in the paracolic gutters
and Morrison's. Pack him up.

224
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,022
No DP pulse.

225
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:21,310
- Does your leg tingle?
- Yeah, like it's asleep.

226
00:12:21,485 --> 00:12:24,486
- Liter up. First HemoCue, 12.
- What's this?

227
00:12:24,655 --> 00:12:27,110
- Metal fragments.
- He's embolized a bullet fragment...

228
00:12:27,282 --> 00:12:30,319
...or the hematoma's compressing
the artery. The clock's ticking.

229
00:12:30,494 --> 00:12:32,617
Okay, line's in.
Let's hook up the blood.

230
00:12:32,788 --> 00:12:35,077
Let's run the O-neg
through the central line.

231
00:12:35,249 --> 00:12:37,740
There's only one O. R. free
and one anesthesiologist.

232
00:12:37,918 --> 00:12:40,753
My policeman's borderline hypotensive.
I need to take him up.

233
00:12:40,921 --> 00:12:42,201
What's the output like?

234
00:12:42,381 --> 00:12:44,836
Pretty brisk. Five hundred cc's
and counting.

235
00:12:45,008 --> 00:12:47,048
He could have a hemothorax.
He needs surgery.

236
00:12:47,219 --> 00:12:50,422
- We' re not there yet.
- What indicates immediate thoracotomy?

237
00:12:50,597 --> 00:12:54,262
Twelve hundred cc's immediate output.
He's at 900, but he's slowing down.

238
00:12:54,476 --> 00:12:56,682
You' re not taking
this lowlife first, are you?

239
00:12:56,853 --> 00:12:58,929
It's about who's in
the worst medical shape.

240
00:12:59,106 --> 00:13:00,386
The guy in there's a cop.

241
00:13:00,565 --> 00:13:02,891
It'll be 30 minutes before
another O.R.'s ready.

242
00:13:03,068 --> 00:13:06,188
Well, can you keep transfusing
and just give me five minutes?

243
00:13:06,363 --> 00:13:08,154
You've got three.

244
00:13:08,323 --> 00:13:10,731
- O silk and OpSite.
- First unit in.

245
00:13:10,909 --> 00:13:13,744
- Five hundred hanging from the cell saver.
- It's slowing down.

246
00:13:13,912 --> 00:13:16,664
- How much?
- A little above 920.

247
00:13:16,832 --> 00:13:18,990
Pressure's up to 110, systolic.

248
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:21,456
Good. We clotted off the bleeder.
Send up the cop.

249
00:13:21,628 --> 00:13:23,667
- Hold on.
- Nine hundred fifty cc's...

250
00:13:23,838 --> 00:13:27,089
- ... and that's it for now.
- Watch pressure and chest tube output.

251
00:13:27,259 --> 00:13:32,134
- BP's 118/78. Heart rate's 92.
- This guy is rock stable.

252
00:13:32,305 --> 00:13:34,761
Another 1000 cc's in the next
two hours, he goes up.

253
00:13:34,933 --> 00:13:38,053
- Pressure's dropping, 96/74.
- Our guy's good. Take this one up.

254
00:13:38,228 --> 00:13:41,679
Thank you, Dr. Pratt.
You heard him. Let's roll.

255
00:13:46,194 --> 00:13:51,189
- When will he be able to answer?
- I'll let you know.

256
00:13:56,454 --> 00:14:00,368
- I keep feeling like I'm gonna puke.
- Any chance you could be pregnant?

257
00:14:00,542 --> 00:14:04,207
I don't even talk to guys
unless I have to.

258
00:14:04,712 --> 00:14:07,962
Helen is complaining of intermittent
right-side abdominal pain.

259
00:14:08,132 --> 00:14:10,291
- She has no fever and a loss of appetite.
- Okay.

260
00:14:10,468 --> 00:14:11,843
I think it's a tumor.

261
00:14:12,178 --> 00:14:14,171
I doubt it.

262
00:14:16,724 --> 00:14:18,633
You gonna say anything?

263
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:22,392
What am I supposed to say?
It's gotta be something else.

264
00:14:22,563 --> 00:14:25,897
Really? What else do you know of that
luminesces under a Wood's lamp?

265
00:14:26,067 --> 00:14:28,605
It's just so wrong.

266
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:31,608
Okay. Take a deep breath.

267
00:14:33,241 --> 00:14:35,150
Do you have any history of gallstones?

268
00:14:35,326 --> 00:14:37,651
- Parents, aunts, uncles?
- No.

269
00:14:37,954 --> 00:14:41,038
- Can I die from gallstones?
- No.

270
00:14:41,207 --> 00:14:47,541
Okay. Let's get LFTs and a right upper
quadrant ultrasound for gallstones.

271
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,083
You know, the real question is...

272
00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:54,176
...who does it belong to? Pratt?

273
00:14:54,345 --> 00:14:55,543
Frank?

274
00:14:55,721 --> 00:14:58,343
- Jerry?
- Stop it, you' re creeping me out.

275
00:14:59,475 --> 00:15:02,048
- This guy reeks.
- The copper and Clorox aroma...

276
00:15:02,228 --> 00:15:05,229
...of a vigorous mixed-bacterial
infection. Smells like surgery.

277
00:15:05,398 --> 00:15:07,770
Come on. Get in there
and break up those loculations.

278
00:15:07,942 --> 00:15:10,349
If you didn't have to dig,
I'd let the ER guys do it.

279
00:15:10,528 --> 00:15:12,070
Irrigation.

280
00:15:12,363 --> 00:15:14,402
- A little bleeder there. Bovie.
- Where?

281
00:15:14,573 --> 00:15:16,981
Just at the inferior edge
of the piriformis.

282
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:19,366
- Up on the Bovie. More suction.
- No, no, no!

283
00:15:19,537 --> 00:15:22,538
Not up on the Bovie.
Vascular clamp and 3-O silk.

284
00:15:22,706 --> 00:15:24,035
Pressure, 110/70.

285
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:27,624
Alcock's canal? Inferior gluteal artery?
Ever heard of those?

286
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,921
- I'm having a hard-
- Stick-tie that before he bleeds to death.

287
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:32,501
All right, give me that.

288
00:15:32,841 --> 00:15:34,336
Turn that thing off.

289
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,467
Hold that up.

290
00:15:39,306 --> 00:15:41,976
All right, no, more that-
Back this way.

291
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:44,514
Stop.

292
00:15:44,687 --> 00:15:46,763
- Do you want me to get Corday?
- No.

293
00:15:46,939 --> 00:15:48,350
- Dr. Romano-
- No!

294
00:15:48,774 --> 00:15:51,395
- Did you page Vascular?
- Twice. Dr. Dorset is on his way.

295
00:15:51,568 --> 00:15:53,360
- Who?
- The new guy.

296
00:15:53,529 --> 00:15:56,280
Laps. Pack around the mesentery.

297
00:15:57,408 --> 00:15:59,281
Oh, damn.

298
00:15:59,451 --> 00:16:01,859
- Tachy at 110.
- Another vascular clamp.

299
00:16:02,037 --> 00:16:04,955
SMA repair looks good.

300
00:16:05,207 --> 00:16:07,745
It's nice of you
to finally join us, Dr. Dorset.

301
00:16:07,918 --> 00:16:10,789
This gentleman has a bullet fragment
in the femoral artery.

302
00:16:10,963 --> 00:16:14,830
He's gonna need a graft or a bypass.
You' re in for a long night.

303
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:18,093
Really? You know they call me
Fast Eddie for a reason?

304
00:16:18,262 --> 00:16:19,542
Several, in fact.

305
00:16:22,432 --> 00:16:23,808
Ten blade, please.

306
00:16:23,976 --> 00:16:25,968
Stand by with a number four
French catheter.

307
00:16:26,144 --> 00:16:29,763
- Have a three-cc heparinized saline ready.
- You' re doing a Fogarty embolectomy?

308
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,971
Clamp.

309
00:16:31,149 --> 00:16:34,435
Well, I prefer to call it the
"Dorset Bulletectomy."

310
00:16:36,655 --> 00:16:38,315
Heparin flush.

311
00:16:40,117 --> 00:16:43,367
- There's no backflow. Totally occluded.
- Yep. Fogarty.

312
00:16:43,912 --> 00:16:45,786
- Okay, give me a hand here.
- Excuse me?

313
00:16:45,956 --> 00:16:47,616
Remove the wire.

314
00:16:49,793 --> 00:16:51,417
Got it.

315
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:01,673
Hey, somebody's glad to see me.

316
00:17:03,348 --> 00:17:04,759
Clamp off.

317
00:17:05,809 --> 00:17:08,264
Feeding the catheter.

318
00:17:09,854 --> 00:17:12,180
- Pressure and pulse are steady.
- Give me your hand.

319
00:17:12,357 --> 00:17:14,480
- Excuse me?
- Your hand.

320
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:21,482
He's got healthy arterial walls. Any
resistance you feel against that balloon...

321
00:17:21,658 --> 00:17:24,908
...is the wall itself.
Do you feel that right-?

322
00:17:25,286 --> 00:17:27,612
Right there?

323
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:32,834
Okay, remember it.
Any harder, you can rupture the wall.

324
00:17:33,002 --> 00:17:35,920
It'll feel hard. Suddenly
the balloon will inflate too easily...

325
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:37,998
...meaning you blew through the wall.

326
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:40,383
- All right.
- Okay.

327
00:17:40,552 --> 00:17:42,877
Bowel's fine. He's a lucky man.

328
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:47,381
Nothing in my hand,
nothing up my sleeve, and...

329
00:17:50,395 --> 00:17:52,019
Good popliteal pulse.

330
00:17:55,149 --> 00:17:57,391
- His leg's pinking up.
- Thank you very much.

331
00:17:57,568 --> 00:18:01,649
I'll be here all week,
and don't forget to tip your waitress.

332
00:18:02,991 --> 00:18:04,568
Driver.

333
00:18:06,035 --> 00:18:10,115
I still have a little physio left,
but there's no permanent damage.

334
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:12,780
- You look good.
- I feel better.

335
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:15,794
- Okay, it's official.
- Thanks.

336
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:19,165
Gallant, could you help Dr. Chen
with the thoracentesis on Mr. Adkins?

337
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,131
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

338
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,874
- Thoracentesis, huh?
- Shaw's, 8:00?

339
00:18:24,053 --> 00:18:25,251
- I'll be there.
- All right.

340
00:18:25,429 --> 00:18:26,840
Thanks.

341
00:18:27,223 --> 00:18:28,598
Hey.

342
00:18:29,725 --> 00:18:31,136
Hey.

343
00:18:31,769 --> 00:18:33,643
Feeling better?

344
00:18:34,063 --> 00:18:36,388
Compared to the last time
you saw me, yeah.

345
00:18:36,566 --> 00:18:39,021
- I was gonna-
- Actually, I need your signature.

346
00:18:39,193 --> 00:18:42,562
- Resident review.
- Yeah, sure.

347
00:18:43,948 --> 00:18:45,739
So, what's next?

348
00:18:46,701 --> 00:18:49,370
I mean your next rotation.

349
00:18:50,579 --> 00:18:52,406
Pediatrics.

350
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:55,665
- Okay, thanks.
- Hey, Erin?

351
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:58,408
- You know, I really have to get going.
- I know. I just-

352
00:18:58,587 --> 00:19:01,588
- I never got to talk to you.
- I was in the hospital three weeks.

353
00:19:01,757 --> 00:19:03,631
I'm sorry.

354
00:19:05,886 --> 00:19:09,836
I was having a bad time.
I never meant to hurt you.

355
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:12,889
Then you should've slowed down.

356
00:19:17,982 --> 00:19:21,814
Leon, pick up the phone, I need
to talk to you. It's me. Don't wor-

357
00:19:22,236 --> 00:19:23,979
I'll call you back.

358
00:19:24,154 --> 00:19:26,028
What's the word on Officer Sutter?

359
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:28,321
Last I heard he was still in surgery.

360
00:19:28,492 --> 00:19:31,161
- The guy you brought in, he have a gun?
- I don't know.

361
00:19:31,328 --> 00:19:34,163
- You just found this guy on the street?
- Yeah.

362
00:19:34,331 --> 00:19:36,039
- You see anybody else with him?
- No.

363
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,664
- Did you hear gunshots?
- No.

364
00:19:38,836 --> 00:19:41,208
Hey, Pratt.
Your boy's losing his pressure, man.

365
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,953
- What's in the Thora-Seal?
- Nine-fifty cc's, like it was.

366
00:19:44,133 --> 00:19:46,209
He's bleeding somewhere.
Maybe it's the belly.

367
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:49,469
- Can't get pressure through the dynamap.
- I'll go get Carter.

368
00:19:49,638 --> 00:19:52,094
Get two more units on the infuser.

369
00:19:59,022 --> 00:20:01,810
- So when are you leaving me?
- What?

370
00:20:01,984 --> 00:20:05,898
When are you planning
on running off to the jungle?

371
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:10,024
Well, I haven't really decided
if that's something I'm gonna do yet.

372
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,406
Really? Luka made it
sound like you had.

373
00:20:12,577 --> 00:20:14,866
Luka's a big advocate of the program.

374
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:18,988
- You thought it was cool when he went.
- Luka went home to his own country.

375
00:20:19,167 --> 00:20:21,243
He didn't have a girlfriend
asking him not to.

376
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,255
- Come with me.
- I have enough drama in my life.

377
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:28,467
Well, well, if it ain't the Ken
and Barbie of the medical world.

378
00:20:28,635 --> 00:20:30,877
- You look better.
- I am better.

379
00:20:31,054 --> 00:20:32,881
- Hello, beautiful.
- Hello.

380
00:20:33,223 --> 00:20:36,888
His blood sugar level was over 600,
but his serum ketone levels are negative.

381
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:41,058
I could have told you that. Type-two
diabetics don't get ketoacidosis.

382
00:20:41,231 --> 00:20:44,849
No, it was a hyperosmolar coma.
You needed insulin and IV fluids.

383
00:20:45,026 --> 00:20:48,858
Both of which could have been avoided
if you'd take your medication as directed.

384
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:52,482
I gave it to a patient of mine.
He couldn't afford his own.

385
00:20:52,659 --> 00:20:54,568
Carter. Pratt needs you.

386
00:20:54,744 --> 00:20:56,404
- Should've paged me.
- Get ultrasound.

387
00:20:56,579 --> 00:20:59,071
- When did he crash?
- Just now. Nothing out the chest.

388
00:20:59,249 --> 00:21:03,626
- I guess the bullet tracked to the belly.
- From the third intercostal space? Milk it.

389
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:06,037
- What?
- Pressure's only 50 palp.

390
00:21:06,214 --> 00:21:07,494
Clots.

391
00:21:07,674 --> 00:21:09,999
When there's no drainage,
you milk the chest tube.

392
00:21:10,176 --> 00:21:12,335
- Okay, he's in V-tach.
- Starting compressions.

393
00:21:12,512 --> 00:21:15,881
- Charge to 200.
- At least another liter in there.

394
00:21:16,641 --> 00:21:18,135
And clear.

395
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,389
- V-fib.
- Thoracotomy tray. Go.

396
00:21:20,562 --> 00:21:22,222
- Splash the chest.
- Pratt.

397
00:21:22,397 --> 00:21:25,600
Get that rib spreader ready.
All right, come on, Pratt.

398
00:21:25,775 --> 00:21:27,400
What are you doing here, Leon?

399
00:21:27,569 --> 00:21:30,238
I wanted to see you.
What are you doing to him?

400
00:21:30,405 --> 00:21:33,571
He got shot. Satinsky.
Get those internal paddles ready.

401
00:21:33,741 --> 00:21:35,734
You shouldn't be here.
Get him out of here.

402
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:38,947
- I need to talk to you, G.
- Could you put him in the Suture Room?

403
00:21:39,289 --> 00:21:41,080
- What for?
- He's here for a wound check.

404
00:21:41,249 --> 00:21:43,918
- Make sure you put him in a gown.
- Is he gonna die, G?

405
00:21:44,085 --> 00:21:46,208
Just shut the hell up
and get out of here! Go!

406
00:21:46,379 --> 00:21:49,000
Okay, we are clamped. Start pumping.
He needs more blood.

407
00:21:49,173 --> 00:21:52,008
- How many units?
- Four units. His heart is empty.

408
00:21:57,801 --> 00:21:59,922
Charge to 30. Clear.

409
00:22:00,093 --> 00:22:02,382
- Still in V-fib.
- Another amp of epi.

410
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:06,254
- Thirty again. How long's he been down?
- Thirty-five minutes.

411
00:22:06,432 --> 00:22:08,139
Clear.

412
00:22:08,475 --> 00:22:10,051
Asystole.

413
00:22:11,769 --> 00:22:13,227
You ready to call this?

414
00:22:13,395 --> 00:22:16,146
- We could try more epi.
- I don't think so.

415
00:22:16,522 --> 00:22:19,558
- He's young.
- He's been down too long.

416
00:22:22,151 --> 00:22:23,811
Call it.

417
00:22:24,402 --> 00:22:27,024
Time of death, 1445.

418
00:22:27,197 --> 00:22:29,983
- Is his family here?
- I don't know.

419
00:22:35,327 --> 00:22:37,616
No, no...

420
00:22:42,749 --> 00:22:46,283
Move any slower, Jensen, this guy's
gonna heal before we can sew him up.

421
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:49,294
- One of your inspirational speeches?
- Elizabeth.

422
00:22:49,462 --> 00:22:52,497
I thought you were doing an
atrial caval shunt. Another lap to me?

423
00:22:52,964 --> 00:22:54,340
I take it he died?

424
00:22:54,508 --> 00:22:57,294
On the contrary, I'm finished.
The patient's in Recovery.

425
00:22:57,468 --> 00:22:59,590
I heard you were having
some difficulty though.

426
00:22:59,761 --> 00:23:02,547
- You were misinformed.
- Apparently.

427
00:23:03,263 --> 00:23:05,470
I didn't realize you were
on surgical rotation.

428
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:07,301
Just assisting Jensen.

429
00:23:09,184 --> 00:23:12,387
So how are we doing, Jensen?

430
00:23:12,561 --> 00:23:15,432
Fine, thank you. Good hemostasis.
No leak.

431
00:23:15,939 --> 00:23:19,982
The posterior cutaneous nerve runs
next to the artery. It's easy to cut both.

432
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:23,228
And the head bone's
connected to the what again?

433
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:27,647
Would you like me to scrub in
to check?

434
00:23:27,822 --> 00:23:29,198
No.

435
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:32,481
It would be a shame for him
to come for an abscess...

436
00:23:32,659 --> 00:23:35,280
...and have a dropped foot
from a severed sciatic nerve.

437
00:23:35,453 --> 00:23:38,785
You' re right. Look, I just figured
out a way you can help me. Leave.

438
00:23:48,086 --> 00:23:50,660
Labs are back. This is
Sydney's friend Fiona.

439
00:23:51,422 --> 00:23:52,620
What did she take?

440
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:55,751
- She didn't.
- Tox screen's negative for everything.

441
00:23:55,925 --> 00:23:58,083
- Did you find any pill fragments?
- No.

442
00:23:59,845 --> 00:24:03,758
Looks like nuts and cherries, maybe.

443
00:24:04,723 --> 00:24:06,929
I smell chocolate.

444
00:24:07,601 --> 00:24:10,470
Her boyfriend cheated on her.
She went on a banana-split spree.

445
00:24:10,978 --> 00:24:12,602
So you called 911?

446
00:24:12,771 --> 00:24:15,854
I didn't. She did. She wanted
to get her stomach pumped.

447
00:24:16,023 --> 00:24:18,062
She must have ate,
like, 50,000 calories.

448
00:24:18,233 --> 00:24:21,067
- Sometimes she binges and purges.
- Sometimes?

449
00:24:21,235 --> 00:24:24,935
She's lost her gag reflex from sticking
a finger down her throat so many times.

450
00:24:25,113 --> 00:24:29,109
- Obviously she has an eating disorder.
- I'll tell you what an eating disorder is.

451
00:24:29,282 --> 00:24:31,156
When a mother hasn't eaten
in six days...

452
00:24:31,326 --> 00:24:34,279
...because she's giving what
food she has to her three children.

453
00:24:34,453 --> 00:24:36,610
She just cost the hospital $3000,
and for what?

454
00:24:36,787 --> 00:24:39,076
So she doesn't put on a pound?

455
00:24:39,248 --> 00:24:40,528
Luka...

456
00:24:40,957 --> 00:24:42,701
It's cheaper than liposuction.

457
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:47,743
Did you know him?
Was he a friend of yours?

458
00:24:48,963 --> 00:24:52,378
- What are you doing in here?
- Came to check in on Leon.

459
00:24:52,549 --> 00:24:54,588
- Couldn't find his chart.
- I'm working on it.

460
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:56,169
- Need any help?
- No.

461
00:24:56,343 --> 00:24:59,047
I don't mind. He seems
kind of shaken up about Biz.

462
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:02,136
That was your friend's name,
right? Biz?

463
00:25:02,306 --> 00:25:05,471
Could you excuse us, please?
This is between me and my patient.

464
00:25:05,641 --> 00:25:08,641
Yeah. Why don't you come
find me when you' re done?

465
00:25:14,148 --> 00:25:15,558
Did you tell him you knew Biz?

466
00:25:15,732 --> 00:25:17,356
No.

467
00:25:17,525 --> 00:25:21,023
- If I did, it was an accident.
- An accident?

468
00:25:21,193 --> 00:25:23,435
It's always an accident
with you, isn't it, Leon?

469
00:25:23,613 --> 00:25:24,940
I'm telling you the truth, G.

470
00:25:25,113 --> 00:25:27,189
You told me a security guard shot him.

471
00:25:27,365 --> 00:25:29,820
It wasn't a security guard.
It was a cop.

472
00:25:30,326 --> 00:25:33,279
- I didn't look. It happened really fast.
- Did you have a gun?

473
00:25:33,453 --> 00:25:35,740
- It was Biz's idea.
- Did you shoot at the police?

474
00:25:35,912 --> 00:25:40,289
I don't know! I don't- Maybe.
I don't remember, G.

475
00:25:40,458 --> 00:25:42,449
Everybody just started shooting.

476
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:46,032
I'm sorry, G.
Please, I don't wanna go to jail!

477
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:51,922
Don't let them put me in jail, G.
I'm sorry, G. I don't wanna go to jail.

478
00:25:52,841 --> 00:25:56,339
I'm going to go out on a limb here
and guess that you're having a bad day?

479
00:25:56,510 --> 00:26:00,293
I'm tired of treating patients
who think ice cream is an emergency.

480
00:26:00,471 --> 00:26:02,179
I'm just tired of it.

481
00:26:04,433 --> 00:26:07,516
I think maybe you should talk to him.
He seems a little depressed.

482
00:26:07,685 --> 00:26:09,808
He's European. That's his baseline.

483
00:26:10,979 --> 00:26:15,355
I'm still mad at him for putting that
"adventure doctor" idea into Carter's head.

484
00:26:15,524 --> 00:26:19,651
- Mr. Hennesey in Exam 1 can go home.
- Oh, thanks. How's the cop?

485
00:26:19,819 --> 00:26:21,692
Good. He's gonna be fine.

486
00:26:22,237 --> 00:26:25,937
So this is where you hide out.
Hi. Dr. Corday, right?

487
00:26:26,115 --> 00:26:27,941
- Dr. Dorset?
- Yes.

488
00:26:28,408 --> 00:26:30,282
Is something wrong with Mr. Sutter?

489
00:26:30,452 --> 00:26:35,242
He's fine. I was wondering if you wanted
to grab some coffee or something.

490
00:26:39,833 --> 00:26:44,209
I appreciate the offer.
To be honest, I'm swamped...

491
00:26:44,378 --> 00:26:46,037
- ...at the moment, so...
- Right.

492
00:26:46,212 --> 00:26:48,418
Perhaps some other time.

493
00:26:48,797 --> 00:26:50,790
I'm gonna hold you to that.

494
00:26:54,552 --> 00:26:57,884
- I like coffee.
- He's cute.

495
00:26:59,263 --> 00:27:02,465
- Was I rude?
- No.

496
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:05,473
Look, the problem is that...

497
00:27:05,642 --> 00:27:10,932
...I go home half expecting Mark to be
playing with Ella in the backyard.

498
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:18,815
It's been a long time since I,
you know, talked to another man.

499
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:26,527
I think I overreacted.
It was only coffee.

500
00:27:26,699 --> 00:27:29,534
I think Mark would want you
to get on with your life.

501
00:27:31,911 --> 00:27:34,745
I also think if a good-looking guy
is interested in you...

502
00:27:34,913 --> 00:27:36,739
...and you' re not interested in him...

503
00:27:36,914 --> 00:27:39,239
...the least you can do is introduce me.

504
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,913
Thank you.

505
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:48,289
I'm not kidding.

506
00:27:52,551 --> 00:27:56,001
Mrs. Hughes? Where you going?

507
00:27:56,178 --> 00:27:59,593
Let's get you back this way, okay?

508
00:27:59,764 --> 00:28:03,713
- Now, you' re supposed to be...
- Looks like you've got your hands full.

509
00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:08,184
- Hi.
- Hello. John Bright.

510
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:11,271
- She has Alzheimer's.
- Oh, poor thing.

511
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,597
Mrs. Hughes, let's get
you back in bed, okay?

512
00:28:13,774 --> 00:28:16,644
Your daughter will be here
in a minute. Could you please...?

513
00:28:18,735 --> 00:28:21,820
I guess I owe you
a very big thank-you.

514
00:28:21,988 --> 00:28:25,403
You provide an invaluable service.
It's the least I could do.

515
00:28:25,574 --> 00:28:29,950
I just hope that we earned the allocation
based on merit as a healthcare provider...

516
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:31,399
...for the community.

517
00:28:31,579 --> 00:28:33,617
Had I not been brought here,
Dr. Weaver...

518
00:28:33,788 --> 00:28:37,654
...I probably would not have pushed
for County to get the additional funding.

519
00:28:38,625 --> 00:28:40,368
Did you give me special treatment?

520
00:28:40,543 --> 00:28:42,666
- Well, I-
- Of course, you did.

521
00:28:43,086 --> 00:28:46,999
From what I've seen, you give
everyone special treatment.

522
00:28:47,172 --> 00:28:50,872
And that kind of dedication
deserves to be rewarded.

523
00:28:53,218 --> 00:28:55,294
Oh, I'm sorry. Gotta go.

524
00:28:58,264 --> 00:29:01,632
Somebody dropped this off, made me
promise to give it to you personally.

525
00:29:01,808 --> 00:29:04,808
- I'm thinking nude blackmail photos.
- Not again.

526
00:29:05,769 --> 00:29:08,140
- Is this because of McNulty?
- What?

527
00:29:09,021 --> 00:29:13,148
You leaving, going to a foreign land
to bring medicine to the natives.

528
00:29:13,316 --> 00:29:15,474
Because he lives in the back
of a free clinic...

529
00:29:15,651 --> 00:29:18,651
- ... you don't do enough?
- Maybe it's got something to do with it.

530
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,647
Why didn't you talk to me
about this?

531
00:29:20,822 --> 00:29:23,359
- I'm not going right now.
- You talked to Luka about it.

532
00:29:23,532 --> 00:29:27,149
- Even if I was, it's for two weeks.
- Some of these places are dangerous.

533
00:29:27,326 --> 00:29:30,030
- I thought you forgot me.
- You need to go back on insulin.

534
00:29:30,203 --> 00:29:31,661
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

535
00:29:31,829 --> 00:29:34,994
Thirty NPH in the morning, 15
in the evening, same as before.

536
00:29:35,164 --> 00:29:37,869
And you need to check your sugars
four times a day.

537
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:41,410
I'd be lucky to find four times
during the week to do that.

538
00:29:42,086 --> 00:29:45,999
Maybe you can hire an assistant.
Or find the time to remind yourself.

539
00:29:47,048 --> 00:29:48,756
- What's this?
- Check.

540
00:29:48,924 --> 00:29:53,466
- I can see that. But I can't take it.
- Why not?

541
00:29:53,636 --> 00:29:56,968
Well, for one thing,
it's got too many zeros.

542
00:29:57,138 --> 00:30:00,091
Get some new equipment.
Hire a nurse.

543
00:30:00,307 --> 00:30:04,090
- Hire a physician's assistant.
- I don't have to name the place...

544
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:06,390
- ... after you, do I?
- No.

545
00:30:06,561 --> 00:30:10,060
Although "The Carter Family Clinic"
does have kind of a nice ring to it.

546
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:12,850
- Thank you, John.
- You're welcome.

547
00:30:13,316 --> 00:30:16,021
How'd you like to come work
for me, beautiful?

548
00:30:16,194 --> 00:30:17,391
Do you have a dental plan?

549
00:30:17,569 --> 00:30:20,190
- No, I'm not giving you any time off.
- I have sick days.

550
00:30:20,363 --> 00:30:23,032
Are you kidding? You' re lucky
you still have a job.

551
00:30:23,199 --> 00:30:24,692
I need time to sort things out.

552
00:30:24,866 --> 00:30:27,902
Yeah, I agree, and you need to do it
on your own time.

553
00:30:28,077 --> 00:30:30,781
Wait. Hey. Where you going?

554
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:33,409
- Dr. Kovac, can I get some help?
- No.

555
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:36,700
Steven Rafferty, 65, with chest pain,
partially relieved by nitro.

556
00:30:36,875 --> 00:30:39,033
Get a 12-lead titrate,
10 of morphine. Go.

557
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:43,041
Sir, can you tell me on a scale
of 1 to 10 what your pain level is?

558
00:30:47,466 --> 00:30:48,876
Luka.

559
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:52,551
He seems pissed.

560
00:30:55,721 --> 00:30:59,884
Been here almost two hours. I figured you
couldn't go that long without a cigarette.

561
00:31:03,185 --> 00:31:04,928
What are you doing here?

562
00:31:07,897 --> 00:31:09,271
Thank you.

563
00:31:10,607 --> 00:31:13,642
- Sure you don't want something to eat?
- I'm fine, thanks.

564
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,398
Good, I need the gas money.

565
00:31:21,281 --> 00:31:23,736
- How's Carter?
- He's good.

566
00:31:23,908 --> 00:31:26,398
- I like him.
- Me too.

567
00:31:36,708 --> 00:31:38,084
It was the disease.

568
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:42,913
I was scared.

569
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,169
I was afraid that I was gonna
end up like Mom.

570
00:31:47,466 --> 00:31:51,048
I didn't want you to see
me like that. Like Maggie.

571
00:31:53,262 --> 00:31:57,721
I never meant to hurt you. If it wasn't
for you, I don't know where I'd be.

572
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:00,013
It wasn't your fault.
You couldn't help it.

573
00:32:00,309 --> 00:32:02,466
It's just...

574
00:32:04,645 --> 00:32:09,519
You protected me for so long.
I felt like I'd let you down.

575
00:32:10,566 --> 00:32:12,641
That's not true.

576
00:32:13,902 --> 00:32:15,360
That could never be true.

577
00:32:16,403 --> 00:32:19,652
I just wish sometimes
I was 8 years old again.

578
00:32:21,074 --> 00:32:23,314
Because even when things got bad...

579
00:32:24,284 --> 00:32:28,909
...and they got bad,
I knew you'd always be there.

580
00:32:31,748 --> 00:32:33,704
And I always will be.

581
00:32:34,875 --> 00:32:37,330
Yeah, but no one's ever there for you.

582
00:32:38,044 --> 00:32:41,791
And I turned my back on you...

583
00:32:42,922 --> 00:32:44,914
...after everything
that you did for me...

584
00:32:47,092 --> 00:32:48,716
...and for Mom.

585
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:52,544
It was a really crappy thing to do.

586
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:55,715
- I'm sorry.
- You don't have to apologize.

587
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:58,843
I do. I want to.

588
00:33:02,895 --> 00:33:04,721
I love you, Abby.

589
00:33:13,694 --> 00:33:16,398
You deserve a better family.

590
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,110
And I just wanted you to know that...

591
00:33:24,451 --> 00:33:26,159
...I'm okay.

592
00:33:27,245 --> 00:33:29,486
Unfortunately...

593
00:33:29,914 --> 00:33:34,870
...I had to get bad before I got better.

594
00:33:41,631 --> 00:33:43,669
It's not over, you know.

595
00:33:47,468 --> 00:33:48,961
Yeah, I know.

596
00:33:50,845 --> 00:33:52,920
Wanna see a picture
of my new girlfriend?

597
00:33:56,015 --> 00:33:57,343
Sure.

598
00:33:59,684 --> 00:34:01,095
What do you think?

599
00:34:03,937 --> 00:34:05,562
It's a plane.

600
00:34:05,731 --> 00:34:10,058
Yeah, I bought it. Sold my car,
my bike, just about everything.

601
00:34:10,567 --> 00:34:14,350
I'm gonna run hunting and
fishing charters in Wisconsin.

602
00:34:14,528 --> 00:34:16,355
You' re going to be a bush pilot?

603
00:34:18,448 --> 00:34:19,728
Pretty cool, huh?

604
00:34:19,948 --> 00:34:23,152
It's probably just a mild virus
that'll go away on its own.

605
00:34:23,576 --> 00:34:26,245
I'm going to send off
some more blood work...

606
00:34:26,412 --> 00:34:29,745
...so you'll need to follow up
with your family doctor, okay?

607
00:34:29,915 --> 00:34:31,787
Hey, Susan, you up for dinner?

608
00:34:31,957 --> 00:34:35,041
No, I am going home, and
I'm going to take a three-hour bath.

609
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:37,001
Come on, you can do that after dinner.

610
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:40,585
- I know this great new Thai place.
- Oh, Jing-Mei, thank you.

611
00:34:40,756 --> 00:34:43,625
Oh, sure. So?

612
00:34:46,801 --> 00:34:49,042
I was using the Wood's lamp today...

613
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:54,461
...when I was wearing your sweater.
And some stuff showed up on it.

614
00:34:54,973 --> 00:34:56,633
Like what?

615
00:34:57,017 --> 00:35:00,848
Stains on your sweater. It's none
of my business. I thought you might...

616
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:03,640
- ... just want to get it dry-cleaned.
- It was club soda.

617
00:35:03,855 --> 00:35:06,475
- What?
- Yeah, Susan.

618
00:35:06,648 --> 00:35:09,317
I opened up a can this morning,
and it sprayed all over me.

619
00:35:09,484 --> 00:35:12,437
That's why I had to take off
the sweater, to let it dry.

620
00:35:12,986 --> 00:35:14,266
- Oh.
- Oh.

621
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:16,153
- Club soda.
- Yeah.

622
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:19,322
Soda water glows under black lights,
remember?

623
00:35:20,158 --> 00:35:23,193
Good. I just thought- I don't know...

624
00:35:23,368 --> 00:35:28,325
What, you thought that I'm this ER
slut with spunk all over her sweater?

625
00:35:28,497 --> 00:35:32,031
No, no. Jing-Mei...

626
00:35:48,178 --> 00:35:50,418
Somebody claim that body?

627
00:35:50,804 --> 00:35:52,049
No.

628
00:35:53,724 --> 00:35:55,514
I heard the cop's gonna be okay.

629
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:58,223
- Good.
- Pratt.

630
00:35:58,393 --> 00:36:00,018
What do you want from me?

631
00:36:00,187 --> 00:36:02,759
I just wanna help you. Or at least...

632
00:36:03,189 --> 00:36:05,476
...prevent you from getting yourself
into trouble.

633
00:36:05,648 --> 00:36:07,226
I'm not in trouble.

634
00:36:08,317 --> 00:36:09,894
What about Leon?

635
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:15,653
- I don't know.
- Well, he seemed pretty scared today.

636
00:36:16,823 --> 00:36:19,574
Yeah. He's a scared little kid.

637
00:36:20,284 --> 00:36:22,322
Except he's not a little kid.

638
00:36:23,619 --> 00:36:27,865
He's 27, and he was probably involved
in a robbery that left a cop shot...

639
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,699
...and somebody else dead.

640
00:36:32,417 --> 00:36:35,371
I think the cops are probably
gonna blame this on Biz.

641
00:36:37,212 --> 00:36:39,418
If Leon went away for a while...

642
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:42,712
...I doubt anybody would
go looking for him.

643
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:53,177
You know what? I try to keep him
out of trouble.

644
00:36:53,348 --> 00:36:57,131
But he wants to have his own friends.
He wants to be cool.

645
00:36:57,768 --> 00:37:00,175
And they talk him into doing stuff.

646
00:37:00,353 --> 00:37:04,516
I can't watch him every minute
of the day. I can't.

647
00:37:06,483 --> 00:37:08,522
You gotta learn to let go.

648
00:37:10,485 --> 00:37:12,727
Stop blaming yourself.

649
00:37:14,613 --> 00:37:18,527
Tell Leon I said goodbye.

650
00:37:30,292 --> 00:37:34,454
Gallant. I need you to do me a favor.

651
00:37:41,216 --> 00:37:45,259
What do you say we go to dinner tonight?
Someplace nice, someplace romantic.

652
00:37:46,094 --> 00:37:49,094
I can't. Eric's picking me up.

653
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,803
Eric, your brother?

654
00:37:52,807 --> 00:37:56,507
- He's here. And he's on his meds.
- He's picking you up to do what?

655
00:37:57,269 --> 00:37:59,095
He's taking me to see his airplane.

656
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:01,476
- He bought an airplane?
- Yes.

657
00:38:01,647 --> 00:38:03,105
- You want me to go with you?
- No.

658
00:38:03,273 --> 00:38:06,937
I think it'll be okay.
He seems really, really good.

659
00:38:07,443 --> 00:38:09,897
- Are you gonna go flying with him?
- No.

660
00:38:10,069 --> 00:38:13,271
- I'm supportive, not stupid.
- I have to go by McNulty's clinic anyway.

661
00:38:13,447 --> 00:38:15,854
He forgot his prescription.
I'll call you after that.

662
00:38:16,032 --> 00:38:17,063
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

663
00:38:17,241 --> 00:38:18,901
Don't go flying with him.

664
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,616
Don't go to Chechnya.

665
00:38:25,414 --> 00:38:29,113
- What are you doing?
- Your Resident asked for a curbside.

666
00:38:29,959 --> 00:38:31,203
And?

667
00:38:34,044 --> 00:38:37,543
There's an area of sensory loss
on the posterior aspect of the thigh.

668
00:38:38,089 --> 00:38:41,706
Jensen bagged the
posterior femoral cutaneous.

669
00:38:41,883 --> 00:38:45,832
But there's no foot drop. Sciatic, tibial,
and peroneal are completely intact...

670
00:38:46,012 --> 00:38:49,794
...although he'll probably be left
with some numbness in his thigh.

671
00:38:49,973 --> 00:38:51,964
Well, I guess he got lucky then.

672
00:38:52,391 --> 00:38:54,218
Yes, he did.

673
00:38:59,354 --> 00:39:02,188
- Where's Jensen?
- He said he was going up to the roof.

674
00:39:02,356 --> 00:39:04,847
- To get a patient?
- To jump.

675
00:39:08,403 --> 00:39:10,608
Final boarding call for...

676
00:39:10,821 --> 00:39:14,319
There you go. Got some snacks
for you for the trip.

677
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:19,190
- How far is Baltimore?
- You should get there tomorrow night.

678
00:39:19,743 --> 00:39:21,072
- Really?
- Yeah.

679
00:39:21,245 --> 00:39:22,524
That's cool.

680
00:39:22,954 --> 00:39:25,789
So you got the phone number
for Greg's Aunt Rose?

681
00:39:26,832 --> 00:39:29,404
- Yep.
- Let's get you on the bus then.

682
00:39:29,583 --> 00:39:30,828
But what about Greg?

683
00:39:32,086 --> 00:39:34,837
- Well, he's gonna call you in a few days.
- He's not coming?

684
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:40,540
No. Listen to me, you're supposed to go
visit his Aunt Rose for a while, okay?

685
00:39:40,717 --> 00:39:43,919
Yeah, right, but is he gonna
at least say goodbye?

686
00:39:44,803 --> 00:39:48,301
Look. He's working at the hospital.

687
00:39:50,223 --> 00:39:51,468
He's mad at me.

688
00:39:51,641 --> 00:39:55,009
No, no. Leon, look, he's just-
He's just really busy, man.

689
00:39:55,185 --> 00:39:58,019
- He's just really busy.
- He sent me away because I messed up.

690
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:01,021
- I'm so stupid!
- No. Leon- Leon, that is not true.

691
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,185
I need to talk to him.

692
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:05,309
Leon, you gotta get on that bus.

693
00:40:05,484 --> 00:40:07,606
- I don't want to do this.
- Leon, listen to me.

694
00:40:07,777 --> 00:40:09,770
You have to get on that bus.

695
00:40:10,989 --> 00:40:13,525
All right, come on, then. Come on.

696
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:20,153
Come on.

697
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:24,954
You have a good trip, okay?

698
00:40:28,834 --> 00:40:30,411
Be safe.

699
00:40:43,803 --> 00:40:47,930
Don't do it, Jensen.
My car's down there.

700
00:40:49,557 --> 00:40:53,221
Your patient's going to be fine.
The leg should be fully functional.

701
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:55,050
There was nerve damage.

702
00:40:55,228 --> 00:40:57,018
Yeah. But it was minimal.

703
00:40:59,064 --> 00:41:00,687
Hey, you'll do better next time.

704
00:41:02,692 --> 00:41:06,901
You're right. Because I won't
go into surgery with you.

705
00:41:57,397 --> 00:41:59,020
Hey, Dr. McNulty!

706
00:42:00,399 --> 00:42:01,857
You in there?

707
00:42:03,943 --> 00:42:05,520
Hey.

708
00:42:11,448 --> 00:42:13,191
Dr. McNulty?

709
00:42:13,449 --> 00:42:16,698
- One-David-twenty...
- Mac, you in there? It's John.

710
00:42:17,953 --> 00:42:19,328
Is there a problem there, sir?

711
00:42:19,496 --> 00:42:22,745
No, no, I'm an ER doc from County,
and one of my patients lives here.

712
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:26,247
- I think he might be in a bit of trouble.
- Did you try calling him?

713
00:42:26,417 --> 00:42:28,742
Yeah, nobody's answering.
He's a stubborn old guy.

714
00:42:29,294 --> 00:42:32,543
I treated him with insulin. I'm worried
that if he didn't eat dinner...

715
00:42:32,713 --> 00:42:34,705
...he might be in a coma
from low blood sugar.

716
00:42:34,881 --> 00:42:37,453
- Okay, you want an ambulance?
- I just need to get inside.

717
00:42:38,926 --> 00:42:40,420
Hey, Mac.

718
00:42:49,683 --> 00:42:51,342
It doesn't look like he's here, sir.

719
00:42:51,518 --> 00:42:53,427
This is his clinic. This is...

720
00:42:53,603 --> 00:42:57,137
This has been his clinic for 20 years.
He lives back there.

721
00:42:57,731 --> 00:42:59,723
I've been working this beat
since ' 95, sir.

722
00:42:59,899 --> 00:43:05,104
This clinic was only here a few weeks.
It used to be a Christian bookstore.

723
00:43:05,277 --> 00:43:07,947
And a tanning parlor before that so...

724
00:43:08,113 --> 00:43:09,856
I was here three days ago.

725
00:43:10,031 --> 00:43:14,906
You know, these clinics, they come
and go. Some are legit, but lots aren't.

726
00:43:15,576 --> 00:43:17,865
Was that guy even a real doctor?

727
00:43:20,455 --> 00:43:22,246
I don't know.

728
00:44:16,909 --> 00:44:19,957
