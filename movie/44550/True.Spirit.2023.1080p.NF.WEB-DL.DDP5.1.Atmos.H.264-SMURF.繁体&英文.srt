00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,080
‎我在澳大利亞的陽光海岸長大
I grew up on the Sunshine Coast in Australia,

2
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,290
‎也就是說 ‎我和我的家人從未遠離過大海
which means my family and I were never far from the ocean.

3
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:20,750
‎我們不是在海里 就是在海上
If we weren't in it, we were on it.

4
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,660
‎我們其實就住在船上 它叫船屋號
We practically lived on our boat, Home Abroad.

5
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:28,160
‎雖然爸爸媽媽和我們四個孩子 ‎蝸居在里面有點擁擠
It was a tight fit, Mum, Dad, and the four of us kids,

6
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,750
‎但只要一家人在一起就很開心
but we were happy because we were together.

7
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,830
‎到了晚上 媽媽會給我們講 ‎天上的外星人的故事
At night, Mum would tell us stories about a starman in the sky,

8
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:39,200
‎還有海浪聲伴我們入眠
then the waves would rock us to sleep.

9
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,750
‎我永遠不會忘記 ‎第一次獨自開船的經歷
I'll never forget the first time I sailed by myself,

10
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:48,250
‎忘不了當風鼓動船帆時 ‎那油然而生的興奮
the rush of excitement when my sail caught the wind,

11
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,500
‎和大海的神奇魅力
the magic and the allure of the sea.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,330
‎我當上了船長 ‎整個世界展現在我眼前
I was the captain and the whole world was in front of me,

13
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:56,450
‎等待著被發現
just waiting to be discovered.

14
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,660
‎我能聽到大海在呼喚我的名字
I could hear the ocean calling my name.

15
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,040
‎12歲的我 為之深深著迷
By the time I was 12, I was obsessed.

16
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,040
‎四年來 我一直在研究海洋和海浪
For four years, I studied the ocean, the waves,

17
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,700
‎學習一切關于帆船的知識
and learnt everything I could about sailing boats.

18
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,870
‎我做了三份兼職攢錢
I worked three part-time jobs and saved money,

19
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:17,040
‎夢想著有朝一日能駕帆船周游世界
because I dreamed that one day I would sail around the world.

20
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:24,540
‎逐夢大海

‎杰絲 試航進展如何
Jess, how's the practice run going?

25
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,790
‎剛被一艘突然出現的貨船撞了
Cargo ship hit me. Came out of nowhere.

26
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:11,910
‎船進水了嗎
You taking on water?

27
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,620
‎沒有 看上去沒漏水 但桅桿斷了
No. No, doesn't look like it, but I've been dismasted.

28
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,080
‎為什么警報沒響
Why didn't the alarm go off?

29
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,790
‎把你的坐標給我
Okay, give me your coordinates.

30
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:25,540
‎南緯26度 25…
Uh, we're at 26 degrees, 25…

31
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,620
‎杰絲 穩住呼吸
Jess, breathe.

‎集中精神
Focus.

33

‎天啊 出什么事了
Oh, my God, what happened?

34
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,370
‎她沒事 跟一艘貨船撞了
She's okay. Collided with a cargo ship.

35
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,830
‎她被貨船撞了
She was hit by a cargo ship?

36
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:05,950
‎酷啊
Cool.

37
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,200
‎一點也不酷 湯姆
Not cool, Tom.

38
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,200
‎她不會有事吧
Is she gonna be all right?

39
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:12,120
‎-她一定不會有事的 回去睡覺 ‎-想得美
-I'm sure she'll be fine. Go back to bed. -As if.

40
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,620
‎杰絲 你受傷了嗎
Jess, are you hurt?

41
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,330
‎沒有 媽媽 我沒事
No, Mum, I'm fine.

42
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,080
‎真的 我保證
Really, I promise.

43
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,000
‎我們說好了的 不能撞上任何東西
Thought we agreed, no collisions.

44
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,290
‎我也不想啊
I couldn't help myself.

45
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,450
‎我能跟杰絲說話嗎 我想跟杰絲聊
Can I talk to Jess? I want to talk to Jess!

46
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,540
‎-讓我說幾句吧  ‎-等漢娜說完
-Oh, can I talk to her? -I haven't talked to her.

47
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,700
‎-那是海盜船嗎  ‎-她把坐標報錯了
-Jess, was it a pirate ship? -She's getting her coordinates wrong.

48
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,370
‎我要呼叫海岸警衛隊
Okay, come on. That's it. -I'm calling the Coast Guard.

49
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:42,040
‎別 會有一堆記者涌過來的
-Don't. Reporters will be lining the docks.

50
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,580
‎他們都等著看她失敗呢 ‎她不能一瘸一拐地回來
They are waiting for her to fail. She cannot come limping back in.

51
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,370
‎-你確定她的船還適合航海嗎  ‎-她認為可以
-Do we know if the boat's seaworthy? -She reckons it is.

52
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:52,790
‎-那個16歲的姑娘… ‎-杰絲需要確認她能獨立完成行程
-Oh, well, as long as the 16-year-old-- -Jess needs to know she can do this alone.

53
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,580
‎她離海岸只有32公里
She's only 20 miles from the shore.

54
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:00,450
‎想象一下 如果這時候 ‎她離最近的港口也有3200公里呢
Now imagine if she does this, and she's 2,000 miles from the nearest port.

55
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,200
‎我們會在碼頭等你 ‎也許情況沒那么糟
We'll be at the marina to meet you. It's probably not that bad in daylight.

56
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:05,540
‎謝謝你 艾米莉
Thanks, Em.

57
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,080
‎杰絲
Jess!

58
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,160
‎好了 聽到我說“迎風轉向”
Okay, so when I say tack,

59
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,950
‎我們就把帆轉向另一邊
we're gonna switch the sail to the other side.

60
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,080
‎準備好贏了嗎
You ready to win?

61
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,540
‎好了 我們開始吧
All right, guys, let's get started!

62
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,870
‎-嘿 杰絲 怎么了  ‎-我還沒準備好
Hey! Jess, what's wrong? -I'm not ready.

63
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,330
‎-沒有嗎  ‎-親愛的
-No? -Oh, sweetheart.

64
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,540
‎-你不想去了  ‎-還沒做好心理準備
-Don't want to go, kiddo? I think we're still finding our sea legs.

65
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,580
‎-好吧 ‎-我聽說你是奪冠熱門呢
-Fair enough. -Well, I heard you're the favorite to win.

66
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,290
‎是啊 也許吧
Yeah. Maybe.

67
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,330
‎來呀 杰絲
Come on, Jess!

68
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:57,120
‎不試試怎么知道 ‎海上是怎樣的景象呢
You won't know what's out there unless you try.

69
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,910
‎別跑太遠
No, no, not too far.

70
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,250
‎等等 艾米莉
Wait, Emily, wait!

71
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,540
‎快來 杰絲
Quick, Jess!

72
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,950
‎過來 好了
Come here. There you go.

73
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:23,410
‎杰西卡沃森唯一的試航提早結束 ‎證明反對她此行的人…
Jessica Watson's only sea trial has been cut short, proving her critics…

74
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,830
‎阿瑟頓 嘿 阿瑟頓
Atherton! Hey, Atherton!

75
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:31,410
‎他怎么就能過去
How come he's allowed down there?

76
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,160
‎-阿瑟頓 ‎-本
-Atherton. -Ben.

77
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,750
‎你們這幫人來這里干什么
Don't know what you lot think you're doing here.

78
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:42,120
‎我們來是因為…
Well, I guess we're here because…

79
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,080
‎（警察-粉紅號）

80
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,660
‎…居然有人要讓一個孩子 ‎開著一艘那么小的船出海
that boat is a shockingly tiny thing to send a child out to sea in.

81
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,950
‎-不光小 還很脆弱 ‎-別理他了
-It's pretty flimsy too. -Leave it.

82
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,580
‎趁火打劫的家伙
Vultures.

83
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,450
‎那就別讓他們得逞
Then don't feed them.

84
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,870
‎為什么不讓得逞
Why aren't we feeding vultures?

85
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,620
‎你姐姐嘗試做的事
It's not every day that someone

86
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,580
‎很少有像她這么年輕的人會去做
as young as your sister tries to do what she's doing.

87
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,330
‎這是一件大事 人們會有疑問
It's a big deal. People have questions, that's all.

88
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:04,790
‎這令她成了關注的焦點
Plus, it makes her a target.

89
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:08,290
‎成功了 就把她捧成英雄 ‎失敗了 悲劇故事也能大賣
If she succeeds, she's a hero. If she fails, well, tragedy sells.

90
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:10,500
‎她才十歲啊
She's ten.

91
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,750
‎他們在尋找弱點 別讓他們輕慢了你
They're looking for weakness. Don't let 'em treat you any different.

92
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,500
‎你是一名船長 明白嗎
You're a captain, got it?

93
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:36,660
‎好的 我是杰西卡的顧問 本布萊恩特
All right, I'm Ben Bryant, Jessica's advisor.

‎我計劃成為全世界最年輕的獨自完成
And, uh, I… I'm planning on being the youngest person

97
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:49,080
‎無間斷環球航海之旅的人
to sail around the world nonstop and unassisted.

98
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,620
‎昨晚發生了什么事
Jessica, what happened last night?

99
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,830
‎-發生了碰撞 ‎-是你的錯嗎
-There was a collision. -Were you at fault?

100
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,790
‎一艘貨船偏離了它的航道
A cargo ship detoured from its route.

101
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:58,830
‎杰西卡 ‎這是你唯一一次試航的第一夜
Jessica, this was night one of your only test run.

102
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:02,450
‎你無法平安在兩個港口之間往返 ‎又如何環游世界呢
How are you gonna make it around the world if you can't make it between two ports?

103
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,700
‎本 我們不是來聽你說話的 謝謝
Uh, and we're not here for you. Thanks, Ben.

104
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:07,330
‎我相信我可以
I believe I can.

105
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,120
‎你明白你要做的是什么嗎
You understand what you're in for?

106
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,540
‎那可是汪洋大海啊 ‎海浪有公寓樓那么高
Uh, we're talking open ocean, waves the size of apartment buildings,

107
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,750
‎風速130公里每小時
70-knot winds.

108
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:18,580
‎這就是航海界的珠穆朗瑪峰
I mean, this is the Mount Everest of sailing.

109
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,450
‎對 航線確實頗有挑戰性
Well, yes, the-- the route is challenging,

110
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,750
‎但我半輩子都在航海 所以我…
but, uh, I've sailed half my life, so I--

111
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,040
‎也就是只有幾年嘍
So a couple years then?

112
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,330
‎我已經完成了 ‎18520公里的里程數 我有資格
I've done the 10,000 nautical miles. I'm qualified.

113
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,120
‎而且我們做足了準備
And we've prepared.

114
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,080
‎她怎么能想到 ‎會有貨船連航海雷達都不看
How could she prepare for a cargo ship that ignores its radar?

115
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,830
‎那為什么在撞擊之前 ‎你的感應警報器沒向你示警
So why didn't your proximity alarms alert you before the crash?

116
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,500
‎我忘記把它打開了
-I forgot to turn them on.

117
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:47,660
‎沃森先生 沃森太太 ‎你們想必無法認同此種行為吧
Mr. and Mrs. Watson, surely you have reservations hearing that?

118
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:52,200
‎她犯了一個錯誤 我相信她不會再犯
She made a mistake. It's one I'm certain she won't make again.

119
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:54,160
‎你們不認為16歲太年輕了嗎
So you don't think 16 is too young?

120
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,750
‎我們憑什么否定她的夢想
Who are we to deny her her dreams?

121
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,750
‎她一直為之努力奮斗 ‎也證明了她有這個實力
She's worked hard and proven she can do this every step of the way.

122
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:02,160
‎那么 新的啟航日定在哪一天
So when is the new departure day?

123
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,660
‎我想應該在十月中旬之前出發吧
Uh, well, I guess we just have to leave by mid-October.

124
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:09,330
‎也就是兩周后 很樂觀啊 不是嗎
So two weeks. Hmm, optimistic, no?

125
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:12,950
‎那是南冰洋布滿冰山之前的 ‎最后一個窗口期
Well, it's the last window before the Southern Ocean's filled with icebergs.

126
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:13,950
‎杰西卡
Jessica!

127
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,410
‎如果官方讓你取消計劃呢
Well, what about calls by authorities to cancel altogether?

128
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,040
‎本 你有能力 ‎讓這個女孩平安回家嗎
Ben, are you the right person to bring this girl home?

129
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,410
‎我有經驗
Got a bit of experience.

130
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,620
‎但你在千禧杯比賽擔任船長時 ‎就曾失去一名船員

132

133
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,830
‎-請讓我說完… ‎-不 我們聽夠了
-Well, let me finish-- -Nah. We're done here.

134
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:36,450
‎四年的努力換來這滿目瘡痍
Four years of hard work boils down to this.

135
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,330
‎我有查看航海雷達 但沒看見那艘船
Ben, I looked at the radar and I didn't see the ship.

136
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:41,830
‎我就是打了個盹兒 沒想到…
And it was just a short nap. So I didn't think that--

137
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:44,830
‎不 你根本沒有思考 ‎這是不負責任的行為 杰絲
No, you didn't think. It was irresponsible, Jess.

138
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,450
‎而且你老是報錯坐標
You know you kept getting your coordinates wrong too?

139
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:51,580
‎你的精神狀態至關重要
It's your state of mind that matters out there.

140
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:55,410
‎如果被閱讀障礙影響了判斷 ‎你會在大海中迷失的
If dyslexia takes over, you are lost in the middle of the ocean, mate.

141
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,410
‎好了 我們明白了
All right. All right, we get it.

142
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,580
‎你覺得我們能修好它嗎
Do you reckon we can fix it?

143
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,450
‎雖然狀況有點慘烈 但沒問題
Bit of a dog's breakfast, but… -Yeah,

144
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,370
‎它還有得救
there's some life left in her yet.

145
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,750
‎不過 修繕它是個大工程
I mean, these aren't small repairs, though.

146
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,700
‎我們既沒錢又沒人力 ‎也沒有合適的維修地點
We've got no money, no manpower, no location to even fix it.

147
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,620
‎不能找我的贊助人出資嗎
Yeah, but won't my sponsors help?

148
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,080
‎之前就換過一次桅桿 ‎不知道這回他們還愿不愿買單
Not sure they'll want to pay for a new mast twice over.

149
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:25,160
‎很多地方可以發揮一下主觀能動性 ‎比如給這張帆打個補丁 重復利用
We can get creative with a lot of it. You know, reuse this rig, patch where possible.

150
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,790
‎絕對不行 ‎必須從頭到腳修復到最佳狀態
Not a chance. We do it right, down to the smallest bolt.

151
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:30,620
‎-沒有資金怎么辦  ‎-那你就來年再去
But what if we can't get the money? -Then you wait another year.

152
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,330
‎-爸爸  ‎-安全最重要
-Dad! Your safety is the only thing that matters.

153
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:36,620
‎若沒有萬全的準備 ‎我很樂意取消這次航行
And I have no problem calling this off if things aren't done properly.

154
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:41,290
‎其實 也許我們就該干脆取消算了 ‎這次失敗算是敲響了警鐘
You know… maybe we should regardless. This has been quite the wake-up call.

155
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:44,500
‎-那是意外… ‎-別急著現在做決定
-No. It was an accident-- -Hey, no one's making any decisions now.

156
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,660
‎我們先等等看贊助人怎么說 ‎對吧 杰絲
Let's wait and see what the sponsors have to say first. Right, Jess?

157
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,540
‎對 是的
Yeah. Yeah, right.

Don't think anything new's gonna appear in there, Tom.

166
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,580
‎很好 你會把自己轉暈的
-Very good. -You're gonna make yourself dizzy.

167
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,830
‎我知道
-I know!

168
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,700
‎-打到你嘍  ‎-喂 別胡鬧
-Got you! -Oi! Cut it out!

169
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:30,290
‎-我接受采訪的話 有錢賺嗎  ‎-不夠多
-Would they pay me for interviews? -Not enough for repairs.

170
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:33,000
‎-杰西卡沃森的冒險就在她的家人… ‎-看
-Jessica Watson's adventure… -Jess, look!

When she read solo sailor Jesse Martin's book,

‎便萌生了環球航海的念頭
she was inspired to circumnavigate the globe.

with infamous sailor Ben Bryant, and worked rigorously to pursue her dream.

176
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:56,330
‎但她的夢想是否演變成了噩夢
But has that dream turned into a nightmare?

177
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:57,580
‎劇情大反轉啊

You'd think they'd have something bloody better to talk about.

‎他們就不能消停一天嗎

‎阻止杰西卡的呼聲越來越高
And calls to stop Jessica only grow.

Rog! Man, how are you feeling about Jess's collision?

263
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:24,370
‎任何青少年出了這種事 ‎都會讓人擔心吧
Well, uh, you know, any teen crashing their vehicle doesn't exactly fill you with confidence, does it?

264
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,540
‎-說好的不回應媒體呢  ‎-我就是開個玩笑
What happened to not talking to the media? It was a joke.

265
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:33,580
‎-在國家電視臺上開的玩笑 ‎-他斷章取義了 知道嗎
That you made on national TV. Uh, he took it out of context, you know?

‎-你覺得我做不到嗎  ‎-什么
-Do you think I can't do it? -What?

267

我不知道
‎I don't know.

268
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:44,540
‎其實我之前以為 ‎你只是一時頭腦發熱 過一個月
To be honest, I thought this would be something you'd fixate on for a month

269
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,910
‎-就會拋諸腦后呢 ‎-別說了
and then you'd get over it. Rog, stop.

270
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,950
‎對不起
I'm sorry.

271
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,830

‎你知道他不是那個意思 ‎他只是害怕了
You know he doesn't mean it. He's just scared.

283
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,580
‎不 也許那些記者是對的
Maybe the journo's right, No.

284
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:48,500
‎也許我就該知難而退 ‎溜出去派對狂歡
maybe I should just… quit, and sneak out to parties.

285
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,500
‎相信我 ‎老爸絕對也不喜歡你干那種事
Dad definitely doesn't like that either. Trust me.

286
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:57,120
‎要知道 總會有人評頭論足

287
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,250
‎談論你該做什么 不該做什么的

-What? -Don't worry. I'll run it.

‎但沒人給我機會
but no one's giving me a chance to.

389
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:07,120
‎那就自己創造機會
So? Make your own chance.

390
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:13,540
‎嗨 我是杰絲
Hi, I'm Jess.

391
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,040
‎歡迎觀看我的視頻日志
Welcome to my video log!

392
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,870
‎傳統的做法是 水手們會寫日志
Traditionally, sailors keep log books,

393
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:19,580
‎但我可不要被剝奪半年的螢幕時間
but you can't deprive me of screen time for half a year.

394
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:22,660
‎不過 大概只有我媽會看這個吧
I'm sure it'll just be my mum watching, though.

395
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,160
‎嗨 媽媽
‎Hi, Mum!

396
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,750
‎我帶你參觀一下我未來七個月的家吧
I thought I'd give you a tour of my home for the next seven months,

397
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:29,450
‎那么…
so…

398
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:33,040
‎這是我的廚房 我會在這兒做飯
Here's my kitchen where I'll be cooking.

399
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:37,750
‎這是導航臺 ‎我在這里操控所有電器和通訊設備
And here is the nav table where I control all the electrics and communication.

400
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:40,410
‎我的床鋪 我在這兒睡覺
Uh, my berth, where I'll sleep.

401
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:43,410
‎廁所
Dunny.

402
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,160
‎這里是存放食物的地方
Uh, and this is where all my food is.

403
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,500
‎比如…
For example…

404
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,200
‎天吶 凍干西蘭花
Oh, my God, freeze-dried broccoli.

405
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:56,120
‎（巧克力 ‎吃過西蘭花才能吃 ）

406
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:58,160
‎干得漂亮 爸爸
Nice one, Dad.

407
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:01,620
‎我會獨自駕船連續行駛
So I'll be sailing unassisted and nonstop.

408
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,950
‎如果停靠港口 就會被取消資格
So if I pull into port, I'm disqualified.

409
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:07,540
‎我必須航行穿過所有經線 ‎繞過全部四個海岬
And I have to cross all lines of longitude and round all four capes

410
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:10,120
‎才能算真正完成了環球航海
for it to count as a true circumnavigation.

411
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,370
‎這是我的預計航線
Here's what I'll be doing.

412
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:14,040
‎這里是悉尼
Okay, here's Sydney.

413
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,330
‎往東北走 越過赤道
Going northeast, up past the equator,

414
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:19,700
‎然后南下 繞過智利南端的合恩角
then back down south to round Cape Horn at the tip of Chile,

415
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:25,080
‎繼而橫渡大西洋 前往南非的好望角
then across the Atlantic Ocean to the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa,

416
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:31,000
‎接著穿過印度洋 ‎到澳洲西部的露紋角
then over the Indian Ocean to Cape Leeuwin in Western Australia,

417
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:35,040
‎繼續行至塔斯馬尼亞島的東南角
then down around the South East Cape in Tasmania,

418
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,910
‎最后回到悉尼港
and back up to Sydney Harbor.

419
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:39,290
‎所以 其實不算太難啦
So not so much really.

420
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,040
‎跟我來
Come on!

421
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:47,830
‎好了 這是開船用的舵柄
All right, so this is the tiller to steer,

422
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:50,040
‎但目前處于自動駕駛模式
but it's on autopilot at the moment.

423
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,160
‎這下面是救生艇
Uh, the lifeboat is under here,

424
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:54,450
‎這里面是浮錨
and in here is the drogue.

425
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:56,950
‎它類似于船錨 不過是軟的
It's like a soft anchor.

426
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:00,500
‎它能讓船在風暴中減速和保持穩定
It slows the boat down during storms and keeps it stable.

427
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:04,000
‎這是我的淋浴用品
Here's my shower,

428
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,870
‎但我好像把梳子落家里了
although I have discovered that I left my hairbrush at home.

429
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:11,120
‎所以接下來的200天 只好用這個代替
So I'll just have to use this for 200 days.

430
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,410
‎至少后院的景致值回票價了
At least the backyard makes up for it, though.

431
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:34,500
‎餓了嗎 科比
Hungry, Kobi?

432
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:46,910
‎-杰絲 ‎-嘿
-Jess. -Hey.

433
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
‎船舶偵測警報運作正常 ‎有一艘船剛從我的西北邊駛過
Uh, ship detection alarms work. Uh, one just went past northwest of me.

434
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,370
‎好的 在這之后的很長一段時間 ‎你都不會再看到其他船只
Good to know. Well, that'll be the last ship you see for a while now.

435
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:58,330
‎你怎么知道
How do you know?

436
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:05,080
‎聽著 你要從那次撞船中 ‎吸取教訓 好嗎
Listen, let that crash be a lesson to you, eh?

437
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,410
‎你現在知道該怎么處理了
You know how to handle it now.

438
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:14,910
‎-你會覺得孤單嗎  ‎-有時候會
-Did you ever get lonely? -Oh, sometimes.

439
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:18,790
‎-但我知道該怎么克服 ‎-怎么克服
-But I know how to get over it. -How?

440
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,540
‎唱歌
-Sing.

441
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,080
‎唱歌 你會唱歌
-Sing? You-- You sang?

442
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,450
‎我們是水手 當然要唱歌
We're sailors. That's what we're supposed to do.

443
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:29,410
‎去睡會兒吧 好嗎
Try to get some sleep, eh?

444
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:33,540
‎你只是在航程第一周有點緊張罷了 ‎喔 有魚上鉤了
You've just got the first-week jitters, that's all. Oh! Fish are calling.

445
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,580
‎-我得先掛了 ‎-好
-Gotta go. -Okay.

446
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,620
‎來吧
Come on.

447
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,120
‎可惡
Oh, bugger!

448
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:49,750
‎（第12天 太平洋水域 臨近斐濟）

before moving onto a boat when Jessica was nine.

‎如今 七年后 杰西卡即將跨越 ‎人生中的第一個重要里程碑
the first major milestone in her attempt to be the youngest person… Now, seven years later, Jessica is about to cross

00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:40,000
‎挑戰單人環球航海 ‎成為完成此舉的最年輕人士
…to sail solo around the world. There we go.

454
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:44,160
‎謝謝你 蘇西 ‎真正的危險在印度洋和南冰洋海域
Thanks, Susie. The real danger, of course, will be the Indian and Southern Oceans, where dozens of sailors,

455
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:48,200
‎在那里 數十位比杰西卡沃森 ‎更為經驗豐富的水手
who are far more experienced than young Jessica Watson,

456
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:50,620
‎都曾接二連三地經歷了翻船
have endured knockdown after knockdown.

457
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,000
‎沒必要給我們聽這個
Didn't need to hear that.

458

‎嘗試環球航行的獨自航海人 ‎要忍受數月的…
-Solo sailors looking to circumnavigate the globe endure many months…

459
00:34:57,790 --> 00:35:01,870
‎穿越赤道對水手來說是一件大事
Okay, so crossing the equator is a big deal for sailors.

460
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:03,500
‎你由此證明自己的航海實力
You've proven your seaworthiness and must be initiated

461
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:06,040
‎被正式接納為水手團體的一員
into the Fraternity of Mariners.

462
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,250

Okay, so…

‎赤道以南 20米 15米 ‎十 五 零
South, twenty, fifteen, ten, five, zero!

464

‎我們從南半球進入北半球啦
We crossed from the Southern Hemisphere into the Northern Hemisphere!

465
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,750
‎好的 作為我的入團儀式…
Okay, for the initiation ceremony…

‎好清爽啊
Quite refreshing, actually.

-To Jess. -To Jess! Cheers!

470
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:51,830
‎真不敢相信 ‎她已經穿越了赤道 太酷了
I can't believe she's crossed the equator. So cool.

471

Red sky at night, sailor's delight. Red sky in the morning, sailor's warning.

473
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,830
‎看天氣預報了嗎
See the forecast?

474
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:19,410
‎嗯 天象已經說明了一切
Yeah, sky says it all.

475
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:24,910
‎對 杰絲 這會是一場大風暴 ‎我們來商量對策吧
Yeah. Jess, this is gonna be a big one. Let's talk game, eh?

476
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,080
‎我會改變航向
I'll change course.

477
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:32,370
‎我的建議是拋出浮錨 抗過去
I think you should launch the drogue. Weather it.

478
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:35,870
‎穿過風暴
Go through the storm?

479
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:39,290
‎風暴的移動速度很快 ‎你不可能繞過去的
Well, it's moving fast. There's no way you're gonna outrun it.

480
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:42,500
‎-但只要抗住 它很快就過去了 ‎-謝天謝地
But that also means it's gonna pass quickly. -Thank God.

481
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:45,660
‎慢著 我們說好了安全至上的
-W-- Hang on, hang on. We agreed to do whatever's safest.

482
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:48,750
‎風暴在這個區域并不常見 ‎爸爸 很難判斷的
Storms in this region aren't common, Dad. It's hard to judge.

483
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:51,620
‎浮錨就像船錨一樣
It's like an anchor.

484
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:54,830
‎會幫助她保持穩定 她不會有事的
The drogue will keep her stable. She'll be okay.

485
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,830
‎我認為這是最好的選擇 ‎杰絲 你決定吧
I think it's our best option, Jess. It's your call.

486
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:05,660
‎好吧
Okay.

487
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:10,160
‎跟我說說
-Talk to me.

488
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:12,580
‎操作流程 對 我們分解研究一下
Protocols. Yeah, let's break it down.

489
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,870
‎我不知道 我不喜歡這計劃
I don't know. I don't-- I don't like this.

490
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:19,660
‎不管你怎么想 本是專業的 杰絲也是
Ben knows his stuff, whatever you think of him. What's more, so does Jess.

491
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:24,330
‎你知道該怎么做
-You know the drill.

492
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:25,290
‎對
-Yeah.

493
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:00,910
‎來吧 浮錨
Come on, drogue!

494
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:17,950
‎我有話跟你們說 ‎我想獨自駕船環球航行
I have something to tell you. I want to circumnavigate the world solo.

495
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:21,120
‎并打破達成這一成就的最小年齡紀錄
And I'm gonna be the youngest person to do it.

496
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,080
杰絲…
Uh, Jess…

497
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,500
‎什么
What?

498
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:29,410
‎杰西馬丁17歲就做到了 ‎他是個跟我一樣的普通小孩
Jesse Martin did it when he was 17. He was an ordinary kid, so am I.

499
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,660
‎我已經計劃好了
Don't worry, I've got a plan.

500
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:36,450
‎我要找個老師 拿到資格證
I'll get a teacher, qualifications.

501
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:41,370
‎這上面列出了所有我需要做的事 ‎還有一開始要上的安全課
Here's a list of all the things I'll need and the safety courses I'll do to start.

502
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:47,830
‎我會通過打工掙錢和拉贊助 ‎來支付重大開銷
I'll get jobs to earn money, and find sponsors to cover the big costs,

503
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:52,200
‎每航海一個小時 ‎我都會相應地做一小時閱讀
and for every hour I sail, I'll still do an hour of reading.

504
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,700
‎那閱讀量可不小呢
-Now, that's a good amount of reading!

505
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:56,580
‎-她很了解自己的聽眾 ‎-是啊
-She knows her audience. -Yeah.

506
00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:00,250
‎那你就開始實施這些計劃吧
Well, uh, you'd better start working through that list, then. Thoroughly.

507
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:03,660
‎只要你下定決心的事 一定能辦到
I think you can do anything you set your mind to, honey.

508
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:25,830
‎杰絲 你沒事吧
-Jess! You okay?

509
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:29,540
‎-我沒事 ‎-出什么事了 你怎么沒來電話
-Yeah, I'm fine. -What happened? Why didn't you call?

510
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,700
‎我被東西砸暈了 但我沒事
Well, I got knocked out, but I'm fine.

511
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:36,370
‎-什么  ‎-砸暈了 你還好嗎
-What? -Knocked out? Are you okay?

512
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:38,370
‎-有腦震蕩嗎  ‎-帥啊
-Do you have a concussion? -Sick.

513
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:41,620
‎-你需要醫生  ‎-船上沒有

I'm gonna sail around the world and I'm hiring you as my coach.

646
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:30,750
‎告訴你爸媽 航海學校有一大堆教練
Tell your parents there's plenty of coaches at the sailing school.

647
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:33,660
‎-我知道 但我想跟你學 ‎-可是…
Well… I know, but I want you to do it.

648
00:52:35,950 --> 00:52:37,540
‎我已經不再航海了
I don't sail anymore.

649
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:39,950
‎因為千禧杯的事 我知道
Because of the Millennium Cup, I know.

650
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:45,540
‎但如果你的學生 ‎成為了歷史上最年輕的
But if you help the youngest person in history

651
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,700
‎獨自完成環球航海的人
sail solo around the world,

652
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:50,750
‎人們就不會揪著馬特特納的事不放了
people will let go of what happened with Matt Turner.

653
00:52:50,830 --> 00:52:52,790
‎他們也許會放下 但我不會
They might, but I won't.

654
00:52:56,290 --> 00:52:58,330
‎話說回來 你為什么想干這個
Hey, why-- why do you want to do this, anyway?

655
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:03,200
‎因為這年頭沒有人再去探險了
‎'Cause… no one explores anymore.

656
00:53:03,950 --> 00:53:08,080
‎登上太空的人比環球航海的人還多
You know, there have been more people in space than have sailed around the world.

657
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:12,830
‎我之前甚至不知道有環球航海這回事 ‎但它確實存在 而我想去做
I didn't even know it was something you can do, but you can, and I want to.

658
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:16,290
‎因為我是個探險家
'Cause I'm an adventurer.

659
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:19,410
‎你喜歡航海
You like sailing.

660
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:23,410
‎但環球航行完全是另一回事
Circumnavigating the globe is a whole different thing, mate.

661
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:26,200
‎我想自己去尋找答案
Well, that's what I want to find out for myself.

662
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:32,160
‎無論我說什么 ‎都無法動搖你的決心 對嗎
You're gonna do this no matter what I say, aren't you?

663
00:53:34,330 --> 00:53:38,200
‎如果我答應了 ‎我可是不會給你特別待遇的
If I was going to agree to this, I'm not gonna treat you special,

664
00:53:38,870 --> 00:53:40,950
‎因為大海對所有人一視同仁
'cause it doesn't matter out there.

665
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,700
‎我只會像對待自己一樣嚴格要求你
I'll only treat you how I treat myself.

666
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,910
第一條規則 別抱我
First rule… don't do that.

667
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,120
‎嚇死我了
It freaks me out.

668

‎（保持堅強 爸爸）

670
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,200
‎-就是這樣 來吧 ‎-好
-That's it. Come on. -Okay.

671
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:23,660
‎本 你都好幾天沒睡了 休息一下吧
-Ben, you've barely slept in days, mate. -Take a break.

672
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:25,580
‎什么 不用 我沒事
-Oh, nah. No, no. I'm good.

673
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:29,000
‎只是在等日志更新
Just, um, waiting on these logs.

674
00:54:29,950 --> 00:54:31,910
‎杰絲在干什么
What is Jess doing?

675
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:44,370
‎（第117天 無風的第五天）

676
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,080
‎杰絲
Jess?

677
00:55:18,870 --> 00:55:21,120
‎你已經反方向行駛幾個小時了
You've been going backwards for hours, mate.

678
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,620
‎對 我之前睡著了
Yeah, I was asleep.

679
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:25,950
‎你沒設置警報嗎
So you didn't set the alarms?

680
00:55:26,830 --> 00:55:29,450
‎一周都沒怎么挪動 ‎我怎么知道船會倒著走
Well, barely moved in a week, how would I know we're going backwards?

681
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:32,000
‎所以才要設置警報啊
Again, that's why you set the alarms, mate!

682
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,620
‎對 好吧 冷靜點
Yeah, okay, chill out.

683
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:37,040
‎“冷靜” 這樣很危險 好吧
"Chill out"? Hey, this is dangerous, okay?

684
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:39,750
‎就是這種時候會出差錯 會有人受傷
This is when things go wrong, when people get hurt,

685
00:55:39,830 --> 00:55:42,000
‎因為某些人的玩忽職守
when people neglect their responsibilities!

686
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:45,500
‎再這樣下去 你會害死自己的
And you, if you keep on like this, you're gonna get yourself killed!

687
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:47,910
‎是嗎 這種事你最清楚了
Yeah? Well, you'd know!

688
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:50,950
‎喂 什么情況
Oi! What's going on?

689
00:55:52,290 --> 00:55:53,370
‎我…
I, uh…

690
00:55:56,540 --> 00:55:57,660
‎你說得對 杰絲
You're right, Jess.

691
00:55:58,290 --> 00:55:59,160
‎對
Yeah.

692
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,200
‎我需要冷靜一下
I need to chill out.

693
00:56:08,790 --> 00:56:09,620
‎杰絲
Jess?

694
00:56:18,870 --> 00:56:22,080
‎這里沒有風 沒有浪
There's no wind, and there's no waves,

695
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,330
‎現在連本也不理我了
and now there's no Ben.

696
00:56:25,790 --> 00:56:28,330
‎只剩我一個人
And it's just me.

697
00:56:30,290 --> 00:56:34,120
‎而我無法擺脫我自己
And I-- I can't get away from myself.

698
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,830
‎（第119天 無風的第七天）

699
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:53,250
‎我還是停在原地
I still haven't moved.

700
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:58,120
‎謝天謝地 你終于接電話了  ‎出什么事了 杰絲
Oh, thank God you picked up! What's going on, Jess?

701
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:00,450
‎媽媽
Mum.

702
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:03,870
‎怎么啦
What is it?

703
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:10,700
‎沒事了 我在呢
It's okay. I'm here.

704
00:57:12,410 --> 00:57:13,410
‎說吧
Get it out.

705
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:19,160
‎我太孤單了
I'm so alone.

706
00:57:22,370 --> 00:57:23,290
‎不 你不是一個人
No, you're not.

707
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:29,750
‎我知道孤單的感覺有多可怕
I know how awful it is to feel like this.

708
00:57:30,410 --> 00:57:33,500
‎但不會一直這樣下去的
But… it won't last forever.

709
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:38,500
‎我沒法告訴你何時會起風
I can't tell you when the wind will pick up,

710
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:41,410
但我知道只要你堅持下去
‎but… I know that if you keep going,

711
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:43,250
‎風一定會來的
it will.

712
00:57:45,950 --> 00:57:47,370
‎就像你的每一位
Just as it has done

713
00:57:47,870 --> 00:57:50,580
‎水手前輩都經歷過的那樣
for every sailor before you.

714
00:57:57,160 --> 00:58:00,000
‎還記得我以前常給你唱的那首歌嗎
Do you remember the song I used to sing to you at night?

715
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:01,410
‎嗯
Yeah.

716
00:58:03,290 --> 00:58:06,700
‎我要你去找夜空中最明亮的那顆星
I want you to search for the brightest star in the sky.

717
00:58:08,790 --> 00:58:10,620
‎每當你凝望它的時候
And every time you look at it,

718
00:58:11,410 --> 00:58:14,370
‎要知道遠在家中的我…
at home… know that I'm here,

719
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,330
‎也凝望著同一顆星辰
staring at that same star.

720
00:58:23,790 --> 00:58:24,790
‎我與你同在
I'm with you.

721
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:28,910
‎知道嗎
Okay?

722
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:30,870
‎嗯 好
Yeah, okay.

723
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:38,700
‎我愛你 杰絲
I love you, Jess.

724
00:58:38,790 --> 00:58:40,250
‎我也愛你
I love you too.

725
00:58:55,040 --> 00:59:00,160
‎有一個外星人在天上等待

726
00:59:00,790 --> 00:59:02,790
‎他想過來見我們

727
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:05,250
‎但害怕嚇到我們

728
00:59:05,330 --> 00:59:10,160
‎有一個外星人在天上等待

729
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:46,660
‎嗨
Hi.

730
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:50,410
‎抱歉 我最近沒怎么錄視頻
Sorry I haven't been here much.

731
00:59:52,410 --> 00:59:55,040
‎我在逃避
I've been avoiding a lot.

732
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:03,160
‎老實說 實現夢想的過程很艱難
Mmm, the truth is that living your dream is hard.

733
01:00:04,410 --> 01:00:06,700
‎而現在異常艱辛
And right now it's really hard.

734
01:00:08,410 --> 01:00:10,410
‎我哭了好幾個小時
I've been crying for hours.

735
01:00:11,410 --> 01:00:12,660
‎我很疲憊
I'm tired.

736
01:00:13,950 --> 01:00:15,040
‎我全身酸痛
I'm sore.

737
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,200
‎連腿都伸展不開
I can't properly stretch my legs.

738
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:23,870
‎我想念我的家人
I miss my family.

739
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,330
‎很想很想
I miss them a lot.

740
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:34,750
‎我也想我那個愛發脾氣的顧問…
And I miss my grouchy advisor…

741
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,000
‎他也是我最好的朋友
…who's also my best friend.

742
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,290
‎一直以來
Ah, but through it all,

743
01:00:46,370 --> 01:00:50,450
‎我都在努力做一個堅韌不拔的探險家
I've tried to be this-- this tough, stoic explorer.

744
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:54,910
‎但那不是真的我 知道嗎
And… that's not me, you know?

745
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:01,790
‎我并不總是樂觀向上 ‎內心強大 無所畏懼的
I'm not always fine, or strong, or fearless.

746
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:06,200
‎無所畏懼…我經常會害怕
Phew! "Fearless." I'm often terrified!

747
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,000
‎會懷疑自己
And I doubt myself.

748
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:11,040
‎而且…
And…

749
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:15,000
‎經常會想要放棄
I think a lot about giving up.

750
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:21,540
‎但沒關系
But that's okay.

751
01:01:22,950 --> 01:01:24,000
‎沒關系的
It's okay.

752
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:29,580
‎因為堅持做自己 ‎這件事本身會給人力量
'Cause there's-- there's strength in being yourself.

753
01:01:30,870 --> 01:01:31,870
‎我覺得
You know, I think…

754
01:01:32,870 --> 01:01:35,700
‎這就像攀登山峰一樣艱難
that's as hard as climbing any mountain.

755
01:01:39,450 --> 01:01:41,950
‎承認自己的脆弱
You know, I think there's bravery

756
01:01:43,660 --> 01:01:45,750
‎需要極大的勇氣
in admitting that you're not okay.

757
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:50,370
‎天吶 這真的很嚇人
Oh, God, it's scary.

758
01:01:50,910 --> 01:01:55,580
‎就像在風暴中被掀翻下船一樣可怕
It's as scary as… almost being swept overboard in the middle of a storm.

‎并不是說我有掉下船過哦 爸媽

01:05:59,950 --> 01:06:01,910
‎他在他的船上追蹤你
He's tracking you from his boat.

783
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:04,120
‎他沒事
He's okay.

784
01:06:04,870 --> 01:06:06,080
‎他只是需要點時間
He just needs a minute, love.

785
01:06:07,450 --> 01:06:08,950
‎這要不是無間斷航海
If this weren't nonstop,

786
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:12,120
‎我和小粉一定會入港維修 毫無疑問
we would be pulling into port for repairs, no question.

787
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:15,120
‎船漏水這情況可不是喜聞樂見的
I mean, leaking on a boat is not what you want.

788
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:19,000
‎但只要視野清晰海況好
But as long as we've got a clear shot and an easy run back home,

789
01:06:19,950 --> 01:06:20,950
‎小粉應該能堅持住
it should hold.

790
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:24,500
‎小粉的設計是 ‎哪怕翻倒過去也能自行回正的
Pink's designed to correct herself if we roll over,

791
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:26,370
‎只要在沒有漏水的情況下
as long as there are no leaks.

792
01:06:26,450 --> 01:06:28,500
‎本應該也會這么說
That's what Ben would say too, I reckon.

793
01:06:29,290 --> 01:06:31,790
‎今天有很多離岸流 ‎知道該怎么做嗎
A lot of rips out there today. Know what you're doing?

794
01:06:32,370 --> 01:06:33,450
‎順應水勢
-Go with 'em.

‎不要與之對抗
‎-Don't fight it.

‎大海永遠比你 ‎比任何其他生物都要強大
The ocean'll always be stronger than you and every other being.

797
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:44,290
‎若你想航海 ‎最好學會與大自然和諧相處
If you wanna sail, better learn to get along with Mother Nature.

798
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:46,830
‎它沒有絲毫惡意
She doesn't mean you any harm,

799
01:06:46,910 --> 01:06:49,660
‎只是在做它該做的事情 ‎但有時候人類擅自闖入了
she's just doing her thing and sometimes we get in the way.

800
01:06:50,870 --> 01:06:51,870
‎來吧
Come on then.

801
01:06:52,620 --> 01:06:53,750
‎我們下海
Let's get in there.

‎嘿 湯姆 怎么啦
Hey, Tom. What's up?

807
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:38,830
‎總理一直提起你
To be fair, the prime minister has been talking about you.

-Oh, God. I don't know if I want that. -Well, then brace yourself.

I'm not sure you're gonna have an option here. Let me check the sky.

828
01:08:56,040 --> 01:09:01,370
‎你為什么要這么對我  ‎就不能放我一馬嗎
Why-- Why are you doing this to me? Why couldn't you just give me a break?

829
01:09:13,830 --> 01:09:15,660
‎風暴前緣已經帶來了
The front's already generating gale force winds

So will Jessica pull into port but get disqualified in the process,

832
01:09:24,290 --> 01:09:25,330
‎還是會繼續前進

‎她能借此抵擋惡劣天氣
It's an option, and could shield her from the worst of the weather.

‎-以錯過第四個海岬為代價 ‎-但她能保住命 蘇西
Though she'd miss the fourth cape. But she'll live, Susie.

836
01:09:36,750 --> 01:09:40,250
‎這是我們現在討論的重點 她的生存
That's what we're talking about here, isn't it? Her survival.

837
01:09:40,330 --> 01:09:44,660
‎澳大利亞青年水手 ‎杰西卡沃森的環球航海嘗試

‎風暴要來了 記得嗎
Uh, storm incoming, remember?

881
01:13:11,750 --> 01:13:15,290
‎對 最猛烈的風暴會在72小時后抵達
Yeah. So the worst of the storms are gonna hit in 72 hours,

882
01:13:15,370 --> 01:13:17,080
‎如果我能穿過去呢
so what if I go through them?

883
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:19,540
‎這不是你能硬抗的風暴
What? These are not the kind of storms you weather.

884
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:23,450
‎我沒想硬抗 我想不用浮錨 順應風勢
No, I don't want to weather them, I want to move with them by not using the drogue.

885
01:13:23,540 --> 01:13:27,200
‎杰絲 浮錨是用來 ‎保持船身穩定的 不能不用
Jess, you have to. The drogue's what keeps the boat stable.

886
01:13:27,290 --> 01:13:30,540
‎對 但在太平洋風暴群里 ‎浮錨會拖慢我的速度
Yeah, but in the Pacific storms, it slowed us down like an anchor.

887
01:13:30,620 --> 01:13:32,160
‎對 要的就是慢
Yeah, that's the point!

888
01:13:32,250 --> 01:13:35,870
‎但小粉在上次對抗風暴時 ‎就被海浪沖擊得遍體鱗傷了
Yeah, but then we were battered by these waves 'cause Pink fought them.

889
01:13:37,910 --> 01:13:40,830
‎你說過我們不該與大自然對抗
I mean, you said we shouldn't fight Mother Nature.

890
01:13:41,950 --> 01:13:43,330
‎那我們就跟它合作
So let's work with her.

891
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:46,120
‎讓小粉去沖浪吧
Let Pink surf.

892
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:48,370
‎等等 她說得對
Wait, she's right.

893
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:51,660
‎如果站在海浪前 你會被擊倒
If you stand in front of the wave, it knocks you down,

894
01:13:51,750 --> 01:13:54,080
‎但如果你去沖浪 就能踏浪而行
but if you surf with them, it doesn't.

895
01:13:54,620 --> 01:13:55,620
‎大部分時候是這樣
Most of the time.

896
01:13:55,700 --> 01:13:57,790
‎對 聽著 不使用浮錨
Yeah, look, without the drogue,

897
01:13:57,870 --> 01:14:00,580
‎你要面對的是18米高的巨浪 杰絲
you're gonna be up against 60-foot waves, Jess.

898
01:14:00,660 --> 01:14:03,000
‎所以不要被海浪沖擊
Yeah, so instead of getting battered by 'em, 

899
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:04,330
‎而是乘浪而上
we'd ride over them.

900
01:14:04,410 --> 01:14:06,080
‎小粉體型嬌小 正好是優勢
Pink being small would actually help.

901
01:14:06,790 --> 01:14:08,450
‎小粉能撐得住嗎
Is Pink up to this?

902
01:14:08,540 --> 01:14:11,450
‎你才剛補好艙壁上的裂縫 ‎它能堅持嗎
You only just patched that crack in the bulkhead. Will it hold?

903
01:14:11,950 --> 01:14:15,620
‎況且你也筋疲力盡了 ‎而那風暴聽起來就像場馬拉松
You're also exhausted, Jessy, and the storm sounds like a marathon.

904
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:17,450
‎我不想功虧一簣
I'm so close.

905
01:14:17,540 --> 01:14:19,330
‎嘿 別關心成敗了
Hey, don't worry about that.

906
01:14:19,410 --> 01:14:22,250
‎現在活著回家更重要
Making it home alive is more important right now.

907
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:24,450
‎你必須靠岸
You're gonna have to pull in.

908
01:14:28,700 --> 01:14:30,660
‎我同意本的說法 安全第一
