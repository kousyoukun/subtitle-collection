1
00:00:41,142 --> 00:00:42,442
Hey!

2
00:00:44,145 --> 00:00:45,712
Make a wish, hon.

3
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:48,381
Yuck.

4
00:00:58,592 --> 00:00:59,426
You can do better than that, come on!

5
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:00,995
Let's see what you got, Mighty Mouse!

6
00:01:02,997 --> 00:01:05,032
Oh, someone's been doing her pushups, I can tell.

7
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:06,133
50 a day.

8
00:01:06,167 --> 00:01:07,134
That a girl.

9
00:01:07,168 --> 00:01:10,137
Now, I want 50 miles an hour.

10
00:01:10,171 --> 00:01:11,939
You got it.

11
00:01:11,973 --> 00:01:13,373
Nice!

12
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:16,143
We gotta go in soon.

13
00:01:16,177 --> 00:01:18,145
Mom's got dinner on the table.

14
00:01:18,179 --> 00:01:20,123
And Coach said that there'll be college scouts there.

15
00:01:20,147 --> 00:01:22,682
So that's why we gotta win to make it into the playoffs.

16
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:26,921
Well, it's great to see such commitment,

17
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:29,900
but your mother and I, we're not sure

18
00:01:29,924 --> 00:01:32,126
you should be putting softball first.

19
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,171
But, Dad, I'm on honor roll.

20
00:01:34,195 --> 00:01:35,096
I know.

21
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:36,173
You don't have to worry about me.

22
00:01:36,197 --> 00:01:38,933
You can play, but you're getting a real degree.

23
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:42,169
I'm gonna play, and we're gonna win, so.

24
00:02:09,864 --> 00:02:12,833
That's what you get for fucking me over.

25
00:02:31,185 --> 00:02:33,120
I got this.

26
00:02:33,154 --> 00:02:34,654
You sure you got this?

27
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:35,890
He's ready.

28
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:45,665
Make me proud.

29
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:52,839
Now get out.

30
00:03:07,922 --> 00:03:09,556
Woo!

31
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:10,589
We did it!

32
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:13,227
You guys were in the zone!

33
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,962
I know.

34
00:03:14,996 --> 00:03:16,831
Amazing game, Kat, I'm super proud.

35
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:21,168
Wanna go get tacos?

36
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:22,103
Hell yeah.

37
00:03:22,136 --> 00:03:23,170
You got it.

38
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:24,204
Great game, Coach!

39
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:47,995
I told you we were gonna win.

40
00:03:48,029 --> 00:03:49,096
I didn't doubt you.

41
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:53,167
You were amazing out there.

42
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,702
Coach said all the scouts were very impressed.

43
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,171
He did?

44
00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:59,572
Professional softball player and a lawyer?

45
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:03,911
I don't know, Kat, I'm not sure you can do both.

46
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:06,947
You can, technically, but you just want me to be a lawyer.

47
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:09,658
I just want you to have a regular source of income.

48
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:10,682
That's what I want.

49
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:15,156
If I get a scholarship, I am saving you money.

50
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:16,891
You should be happy about that.

51
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:21,228
You make a very good argument there,

52
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:23,197
but it's not me you gotta convince.

53
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:25,765
It's your mother.

54
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:27,168
You always say that.

55
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:29,270
I always say it
'cause it's true.

56
00:04:29,303 --> 00:04:31,005
We only want the best for you.

57
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:34,241
But you totally nailed it today.

58
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:35,275
Thanks.

59
00:04:52,226 --> 00:04:53,226
Be right back.

60
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:55,734
Don't be taking off on me.

61
00:05:00,201 --> 00:05:02,103
Hey, you know what you should be?

62
00:05:03,204 --> 00:05:04,805
A comedian.

63
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:07,174
If I left you here, what would I eat for dinner?

64
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:08,708
Your mother's leftovers.

65
00:05:09,844 --> 00:05:12,313
I ain't going nowhere, I swear.

66
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,359
- Hey, Juana.
- Hey.

67
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:26,193
I've come to pick up.

68
00:05:26,227 --> 00:05:28,429
Taco Tuesday.

69
00:05:58,359 --> 00:06:00,361
Get out of the fucking car now, get out!

70
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:04,198
No, Dad, Dad!

71
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:05,798
Bitch, I'll fucking shoot you.

72
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:06,433
Dad!

73
00:06:06,467 --> 00:06:07,334
Shut the fuck up.

74
00:06:07,368 --> 00:06:08,035
Dad!

75
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,172
Don't look at me!

76
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:12,173
Dad!

77
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:28,422
What do you want from me?

78
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:30,433
Please, I don't have any money, I don't have anything.

79
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:32,126
Money?

80
00:06:35,196 --> 00:06:38,332
I don't want your money, little girl.

81
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:40,201
I want your soul.

82
00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:50,244
It's what Father wants.

83
00:06:51,312 --> 00:06:54,215
To become one of us, to become it.

84
00:06:57,784 --> 00:07:00,354
Great, got the extra salsa and guac?

85
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:02,323
Show me you want it.

86
00:07:02,356 --> 00:07:04,024
Show me.

87
00:07:05,226 --> 00:07:07,361
No, no, no, no, no!

88
00:07:07,394 --> 00:07:09,196
No!

89
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:22,568
It's done.

90
00:07:24,245 --> 00:07:26,013
Kat!

91
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:27,157
We gotta go, brother.

92
00:07:27,181 --> 00:07:28,515
Now.
- Kat!

93
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,147
On the ground!

94
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:02,950
Kat!

95
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:17,196
Help me!

96
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:29,576
William!

97
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,610
Jen.

98
00:08:34,148 --> 00:08:35,282
What happened?

99
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:39,186
They hurt her.

100
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:44,091
Are you okay?

101
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:53,233
No, no, no, no, no.

102
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:58,405
No, no.

103
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:04,178
No, no.

104
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:06,313
Oh, please, no, no, no.

105
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:13,220
The Eatonton Journal emailed, asking for an interview.

106
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:18,192
William, did you hear me?

107
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:25,099
I have to go meet with the prosecuting attorney.

108
00:09:25,132 --> 00:09:26,367
What do they want?

109
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:34,617
In the interest of getting this thug

110
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:36,977
off the streets as soon as possible,

111
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,355
his attorneys agreed to plead guilty

112
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:40,147
to assaulting an officer,

113
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,224
possession with the intent to distribute,

114
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:44,151
and resisting arrest, and that's all in addition

115
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:46,153
to his parole violations.

116
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:47,621
We're looking at five to seven.

117
00:09:50,391 --> 00:09:51,358
Years, that's it?

118
00:09:51,392 --> 00:09:53,427
If he keeps clean, he could be out in three,

119
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,396
but, yes, that's what it's looking like.

120
00:09:57,197 --> 00:09:59,066
This kid murdered my daughter.

121
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:05,305
He should be executed or life in jail, no parole.

122
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:09,176
Mr. Duncan, we've got no video, no photos,

123
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,179
no eyewitnesses except you.

124
00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:14,214
You got a concussion during the struggle.

125
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:17,618
You want everything riding on an eye test,

126
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:19,186
some optometrist they put on the stand

127
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:21,989
who's gonna say you were in shock and hallucinating?

128
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,158
I know what I saw.

129
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:26,160
Your biggest problem is that there's no gun.

130
00:10:26,193 --> 00:10:28,128
Well, they took it.

131
00:10:28,162 --> 00:10:29,162
Who's they?

132
00:10:30,364 --> 00:10:32,166
I'm just saying what they're gonna say.

133
00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:34,101
Look, if you wanna try to convince the DA

134
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,170
to take this to trial, you're welcome to.

135
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:37,380
But this case is so paper thin,

136
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:39,106
the judge is probably gonna throw it out,

137
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:42,176
and Danny Fetter is gonna be back on the streets.

138
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:45,078
At least this way, he's off for a good few years.

139
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:46,523
Basically, it's your word against his.

140
00:10:46,547 --> 00:10:48,649
It's bullshit is what it is.

141
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:50,184
It's bullshit, and you know it!

142
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:52,419
I'm not disagreeing with you, Mr. Duncan,

143
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,222
but I gotta be honest, I had to schmooze

144
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:57,424
the judge to agree to half those charges.

145
00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:00,427
The plea deal makes the most sense, trust me.

146
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:06,166
And that night, outside the Mexican restaurant

147
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,001
that you and your daughter visited,

148
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:09,646
can you point out the attacker that you saw

149
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,205
and physically fought with?

150
00:11:21,615 --> 00:11:23,016
No.

151
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:24,684
Settle.

152
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:28,489
Not sure I can confidently identify

153
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:31,425
that man as the attacker, Your Honor.

154
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:33,794
What the fuck are you doing?

155
00:11:33,828 --> 00:11:37,197
Mr. Duncan, are you absolutely sure

156
00:11:37,231 --> 00:11:40,234
that you cannot confidently point out the attacker?

157
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:46,673
Yes, Your Honor, I'm 100% sure.

158
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:49,176
Mr. Fetter, you are free to go.

159
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:53,180
I see no reason to further waste this court's time.

160
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:56,683
Case dismissed.

161
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:23,210
I'm so fucking proud of you.

162
00:12:23,978 --> 00:12:26,380
You can do anything in this life, you know that?

163
00:12:29,316 --> 00:12:31,184
You can do anything.

164
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:35,187
I love you.

165
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:37,356
Come on.

166
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:57,544
You did good.

167
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:01,615
You can run this world, the streets, everything.

168
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:05,118
It can be yours.

169
00:13:05,152 --> 00:13:07,855
If anybody tells you otherwise, you know what to do.

170
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:12,292
You're a man now.

171
00:13:13,527 --> 00:13:14,527
Thanks, Dad.

172
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:16,762
Get in the truck.

173
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:44,767
Go see what that guy wants, all right?

174
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:45,592
Right.

175
00:13:45,626 --> 00:13:48,228
Come on now.

176
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:49,396
Hurry the fuck up, bitch.

177
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:50,631
All right, whatever.

178
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,543
You look like you could use some fun, baby.

179
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:06,779
I'm fine, thanks.

180
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:10,549
Missing out.

181
00:14:14,788 --> 00:14:15,722
All right, let's get outta here now.

182
00:14:15,756 --> 00:14:18,291
All right, man, I'm coming, yeah.

183
00:14:18,325 --> 00:14:19,803
Don't fuck up with that other one, too, baby.

184
00:14:19,827 --> 00:14:20,627
Got it.

185
00:14:20,661 --> 00:14:22,229
Get your ass moving, come on.

186
00:15:00,434 --> 00:15:02,937
Oh, motherfucker!

187
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:05,807
My leg is broke.

188
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:09,508
You.

189
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:13,014
You're that girl's pops.

190
00:15:13,047 --> 00:15:14,448
Yep.

191
00:15:16,017 --> 00:15:17,017
Her pops.

192
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,254
And you're here to kill me, huh?

193
00:15:28,395 --> 00:15:29,030
What?

194
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:40,007
If you do this, there's no going back for you, asshole.

195
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:41,441
You killed my little girl.

196
00:15:44,045 --> 00:15:45,046
She was innocent.

197
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:47,581
Yeah, sure about about that, huh?

198
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:52,285
She looked pretty good to me.

199
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:52,173
Oh, wait, look there.

200
00:17:52,206 --> 00:17:54,075
What's?

201
00:18:00,714 --> 00:18:02,154
Looks like that was just yesterday.

202
00:18:05,152 --> 00:18:06,854
Why are you all zippered up?

203
00:18:08,122 --> 00:18:09,123
I was cold.

204
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,861
William, are you okay?

205
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:16,898
Yeah, I'm good.

206
00:18:20,101 --> 00:18:22,769
I'm just gonna go take a shower.

207
00:19:26,033 --> 00:19:27,868
Your heart's racing.

208
00:19:30,938 --> 00:19:32,006
Are you okay?

209
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:37,710
I just...

210
00:19:40,714 --> 00:19:44,051
It just keeps running around in circles.

211
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:47,088
If we hadn't stopped for takeout,

212
00:19:47,121 --> 00:19:49,890
if we'd taken a different route,

213
00:19:49,924 --> 00:19:53,961
if the game had finished 15 minutes later, just she...

214
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,098
She'd still be here.

215
00:19:58,966 --> 00:20:00,800
You can't do that to yourself.

216
00:20:06,073 --> 00:20:08,075
Last time you were like this

217
00:20:08,109 --> 00:20:12,913
was when you got off that plane.

218
00:21:00,261 --> 00:21:01,128
Be right back.

219
00:21:21,415 --> 00:21:22,715
You're fucking late.

220
00:21:24,852 --> 00:21:25,852
Five minutes.

221
00:21:26,854 --> 00:21:30,623
A lot can happen in five minutes.

222
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:32,625
I can cut your fucking dick off

223
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:36,097
in five fucking minutes,

224
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:37,797
and shove it up your ass.

225
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:39,798
Sure.

226
00:21:48,342 --> 00:21:49,410
What the fuck is this?

227
00:21:49,443 --> 00:21:51,045
It's dead out there.

228
00:21:51,078 --> 00:21:53,713
You don't think that I know this town?

229
00:21:53,746 --> 00:21:55,015
Where's the rest of it?

230
00:21:56,783 --> 00:21:57,783
That's it.

231
00:22:01,155 --> 00:22:02,156
Shit, man.

232
00:22:08,162 --> 00:22:09,130
What?

233
00:22:13,334 --> 00:22:15,102
Danny's dead.

234
00:22:17,471 --> 00:22:19,006
What the fuck?

235
00:22:20,341 --> 00:22:24,378
I give you and your friends full access.

236
00:22:25,712 --> 00:22:27,081
You disrespect me.

237
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,384
Whatever.

238
00:22:30,417 --> 00:22:31,852
You fucking high?

239
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:35,022
You're high right now, aren't you?

240
00:22:35,055 --> 00:22:37,158
Yeah, I'm the one that's high.

241
00:22:38,392 --> 00:22:39,792
Fucking tweaker.

242
00:22:40,494 --> 00:22:44,899
You come up short like this again, I won't be forgiving.

243
00:22:47,501 --> 00:22:49,170
Now get the fuck outta here.

244
00:22:51,172 --> 00:22:52,172
A pleasure.

245
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,040
Junkie.

246
00:23:01,148 --> 00:23:02,016
Shit.

247
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,860
What?

248
00:23:14,828 --> 00:23:15,930
It's Danny.

249
00:23:18,499 --> 00:23:20,134
What about my brother?

250
00:23:30,177 --> 00:23:31,744
Yo, yo, yo, I can't let you in.

251
00:23:31,778 --> 00:23:33,156
Can't let you in.
- That's my brother.

252
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,224
I said I need you to step back.

253
00:23:34,248 --> 00:23:35,216
I just told you that that's my little brother.

254
00:23:35,249 --> 00:23:37,318
And I just told you I need you to step back.

255
00:23:37,351 --> 00:23:39,053
I'm not gonna ask you again.

256
00:23:40,154 --> 00:23:41,154
Who did this?

257
00:23:42,957 --> 00:23:44,467
That's what we're trying to find out.

258
00:23:44,491 --> 00:23:46,160
Rory.

259
00:23:49,129 --> 00:23:50,130
Hey, man.

260
00:23:53,067 --> 00:23:54,067
Not right now.

261
00:23:55,836 --> 00:23:56,836
I know.

262
00:24:08,282 --> 00:24:10,117
Put your goddamn weapon away.

263
00:24:14,922 --> 00:24:16,123
Who the hell is that guy?

264
00:24:16,957 --> 00:24:18,101
That's Rory Fetter.

265
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:19,125
Donnie's boy?

266
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,363
Yeah.

267
00:24:22,396 --> 00:24:27,401
Shit.

268
00:24:47,154 --> 00:24:48,522
Can I help you?

269
00:24:48,555 --> 00:24:49,890
Detective Neil Chen.

270
00:24:54,895 --> 00:24:56,297
Are you William Duncan?
- Yeah.

271
00:24:57,898 --> 00:24:59,099
What's going on?

272
00:24:59,133 --> 00:25:00,067
I came here to inform you

273
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,740
that Danny Fetter was murdered last night.

274
00:25:02,936 --> 00:25:03,936
Oh.

275
00:25:06,206 --> 00:25:09,076
Well, how did it happen?

276
00:25:09,109 --> 00:25:10,109
Not sure yet.

277
00:25:10,744 --> 00:25:12,913
What were you doing last night, Mr. Duncan?

278
00:25:14,081 --> 00:25:15,081
I was here.

279
00:25:15,683 --> 00:25:19,153
I mean, I went for a walk, but I was here.

280
00:25:19,186 --> 00:25:21,155
Yeah, he was here.

281
00:25:22,189 --> 00:25:23,390
Am I a suspect, Detective?

282
00:25:24,625 --> 00:25:26,093
At this point, I can't say.

283
00:25:26,126 --> 00:25:27,628
I didn't kill him.

284
00:25:27,661 --> 00:25:29,430
Sure, I understand what you're saying.

285
00:25:31,398 --> 00:25:33,367
You have any idea who did?

286
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:37,037
No, but all of those Fetter boys

287
00:25:37,071 --> 00:25:39,440
run in some dicey circles, so we got a few leads.

288
00:25:42,142 --> 00:25:46,480
Well, I wish we could help.

289
00:25:47,648 --> 00:25:49,116
As you can imagine, my wife and I

290
00:25:49,149 --> 00:25:52,152
are going through our own grief right now, so.

291
00:25:52,953 --> 00:25:55,122
Well, I'll let you know if there is.

292
00:25:55,155 --> 00:25:56,155
Here.

293
00:25:57,157 --> 00:25:59,593
Give me a call if you think of anything

294
00:25:59,626 --> 00:26:01,495
that might be helpful,

295
00:26:01,528 --> 00:26:04,531
and don't leave town without letting me know, okay?

296
00:26:04,565 --> 00:26:06,633
Might have a few more questions.

297
00:26:06,667 --> 00:26:07,667
Sure.

298
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:20,681
You okay?

299
00:26:20,714 --> 00:26:21,714
Yeah.

300
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,521
Where were you last night?

301
00:26:29,156 --> 00:26:30,367
I just said, I went for a walk.

302
00:26:30,391 --> 00:26:32,459
You never just go for a walk.

303
00:26:34,161 --> 00:26:37,164
Well, I've also never had my only child murdered before.

304
00:26:38,532 --> 00:26:41,034
I don't want you to go back to how you were.

305
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:44,638
What does that mean?

306
00:26:44,671 --> 00:26:46,349
You mean when I had bullets flying around my head

307
00:26:46,373 --> 00:26:49,009
and my best friends were dying all around me?

308
00:26:49,042 --> 00:26:50,042
Is that what you meant?

309
00:26:51,178 --> 00:26:52,178
This is different.

310
00:26:54,615 --> 00:26:55,615
It's our daughter.

311
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:04,390
You know what?

312
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,995
I can't believe you'd even say that.

313
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:17,738
To Danny.

314
00:27:17,771 --> 00:27:18,572
Danny.

315
00:27:19,473 --> 00:27:20,574
Salut.

316
00:27:20,607 --> 00:27:22,443
He was good fucking man.

317
00:27:27,481 --> 00:27:29,483
I wanna find the person that did this.

318
00:27:32,753 --> 00:27:34,321
I don't just wanna take their life.

319
00:27:34,354 --> 00:27:36,590
I want him to suffer indescribably.

320
00:27:36,623 --> 00:27:38,392
Don't trip, boss.

321
00:27:38,425 --> 00:27:39,425
We gonna find him.

322
00:27:41,195 --> 00:27:43,030
We gonna find him.

323
00:27:43,063 --> 00:27:44,063
Will we?

324
00:27:46,366 --> 00:27:47,534
Where will we find him?

325
00:27:48,168 --> 00:27:51,138
Is he in your bottle that you're drinking?

326
00:27:51,171 --> 00:27:52,439
Is he under this table?

327
00:27:53,307 --> 00:27:54,708
Huh, are you him?

328
00:27:55,576 --> 00:27:59,046
Do you plan on finding him while you're sitting

329
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:00,647
on your fat fucking ass, drinking?

330
00:28:01,381 --> 00:28:03,150
The girls was out all night last night.

331
00:28:03,183 --> 00:28:04,718
Maybe they saw something.

332
00:28:04,751 --> 00:28:07,020
You know what I'm saying?

333
00:28:09,189 --> 00:28:10,189
Ask 'em.

334
00:28:11,658 --> 00:28:12,658
Yeah, now.

335
00:28:14,194 --> 00:28:15,162
Yeah.

336
00:28:20,167 --> 00:28:23,370
Yo, yo, girls, get off the fucking pole!

337
00:28:23,403 --> 00:28:24,403
Come here!

338
00:28:25,372 --> 00:28:26,773
Hurry up, come on now!

339
00:28:28,709 --> 00:28:29,709
Come on.

340
00:28:30,444 --> 00:28:31,645
Shit.

341
00:28:35,148 --> 00:28:38,418
Y'all see anything strange out here last night?

342
00:28:38,452 --> 00:28:39,452
Huh?

343
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,221
Yeah, I saw a guy.

344
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:44,124
Oh, yeah?

345
00:28:44,157 --> 00:28:45,425
Yeah.

346
00:28:45,459 --> 00:28:46,760
Seemed kinda out of place.

347
00:28:48,095 --> 00:28:49,429
Really?

348
00:28:49,463 --> 00:28:51,131
Come with me.

349
00:28:51,164 --> 00:28:52,533
Come on!

350
00:28:52,566 --> 00:28:53,700
Come on, shit.

351
00:28:55,502 --> 00:28:58,472
Tell him, tell him what you told me.

352
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:14,555
There was this one white guy, dressed real well,

353
00:29:14,588 --> 00:29:18,125
like a businessman, just waiting in his car.

354
00:29:18,158 --> 00:29:22,062
I went up to him, but he wasn't there to party.

355
00:29:23,397 --> 00:29:27,869
Looked kinda nervous, actually, real intense.

356
00:29:27,902 --> 00:29:28,902
Hmm.

357
00:29:31,705 --> 00:29:32,705
Hold that.

358
00:29:40,848 --> 00:29:43,350
Is that him, is that the man you almost serviced?

359
00:29:44,418 --> 00:29:47,187
That's him, definitely.

360
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,628
William Duncan.

361
00:29:58,165 --> 00:29:59,199
It's the dad.

362
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:05,505
It's the father of the little girl that Danny did.

363
00:30:11,178 --> 00:30:14,147
Get everyone, everyone.

364
00:30:15,582 --> 00:30:17,517
I want to go hunting.

365
00:30:51,218 --> 00:30:54,221
I spy with my little eye a dead guy.

366
00:30:55,789 --> 00:30:56,789
Gotcha.

367
00:31:32,994 --> 00:31:33,995
Get up.

368
00:32:03,057 --> 00:32:05,659
That was exciting, William Duncan.

369
00:32:06,994 --> 00:32:08,996
That's right, I know your name.

370
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:11,966
I know everything about you.

371
00:32:15,002 --> 00:32:16,971
What do you want?

372
00:32:17,004 --> 00:32:17,939
What do I want?

373
00:32:17,972 --> 00:32:20,474
I want you to not exist anymore.

374
00:32:22,676 --> 00:32:23,777
I wanna watch you die.

375
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,981
You killed my brother.

376
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:29,850
I want revenge.

377
00:32:47,334 --> 00:32:48,970
Please, please.

378
00:32:49,003 --> 00:32:51,404
Please, please, please.

379
00:33:09,991 --> 00:33:11,324
Hey!

380
00:33:11,358 --> 00:33:12,592
There's a shooter!

381
00:33:12,626 --> 00:33:13,794
There's a shooter!

382
00:33:14,694 --> 00:33:15,328
There's a shooter!

383
00:33:15,362 --> 00:33:16,563
There's a guy on the ground!

384
00:33:16,596 --> 00:33:17,664
I think he got shot!

385
00:33:24,806 --> 00:33:26,339
Right there, right there.

386
00:33:35,149 --> 00:33:36,583
Are you at home?

387
00:33:36,616 --> 00:33:38,451
Lock all the doors and windows.

388
00:33:38,485 --> 00:33:39,719
Just do it!

389
00:33:39,753 --> 00:33:41,989
I'll explain it all when I get home.

390
00:33:51,032 --> 00:33:51,999
Get back inside the house!
- What's going on?

391
00:33:52,033 --> 00:33:52,834
Why, what?

392
00:33:52,867 --> 00:33:53,667
Inside!

393
00:34:01,741 --> 00:34:03,010
What the hell is going on?

394
00:34:04,011 --> 00:34:05,679
Some people tried to kill me.

395
00:34:06,746 --> 00:34:07,982
What, why?

396
00:34:08,015 --> 00:34:09,951
Does it matter?

397
00:34:11,451 --> 00:34:13,120
You need to call that detective.

398
00:34:17,524 --> 00:34:18,725
Call.

399
00:34:29,536 --> 00:34:30,972
Well, the prints came back.

400
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:35,408
The vic is a Jason Ditman, aka Henley.

401
00:34:37,111 --> 00:34:38,645
Henley.

402
00:34:38,678 --> 00:34:40,014
How do I know that name?

403
00:34:40,047 --> 00:34:41,648
He's one of Rory Fetter's boys.

404
00:34:43,583 --> 00:34:45,019
What the hell is going on?

405
00:34:51,458 --> 00:34:52,458
This is Neil Chen.

406
00:34:53,727 --> 00:34:56,030
Detective, it's William Duncan.

407
00:34:57,965 --> 00:34:59,200
William Duncan.

408
00:34:59,233 --> 00:35:01,168
I was just thinking about you.

409
00:35:01,202 --> 00:35:02,202
What's up?

410
00:35:03,104 --> 00:35:05,605
I need you to come to the house.

411
00:35:08,042 --> 00:35:09,643
Yeah, I'll be right there.

412
00:35:13,647 --> 00:35:14,748
Excuse me.

413
00:35:14,781 --> 00:35:15,950
You can try to spin this,

414
00:35:15,983 --> 00:35:17,784
but I know you killed Danny Fetter.

415
00:35:19,987 --> 00:35:21,055
I know why you did it.

416
00:35:21,989 --> 00:35:23,590
I honestly don't even blame you.

417
00:35:26,027 --> 00:35:26,994
I'm pretty sure that it'll shake out

418
00:35:27,028 --> 00:35:28,148
that you killed Henley, too.

419
00:35:28,829 --> 00:35:31,832
That dead guy, from like an hour ago?

420
00:35:35,236 --> 00:35:38,039
You can give me the silent treatment all you want.

421
00:35:38,072 --> 00:35:40,207
There is no other reason why Rory Fetter

422
00:35:40,241 --> 00:35:42,009
would be so gung-ho to kill you.

423
00:35:42,043 --> 00:35:43,677
You know damn well you started a war.

424
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:44,979
Now you want me to help you.

425
00:35:45,012 --> 00:35:46,047
I don't know if I can.

426
00:35:47,982 --> 00:35:49,050
Why should I help you?

427
00:35:51,953 --> 00:35:53,263
I don't want my wife to get hurt.

428
00:35:53,287 --> 00:35:54,889
You should've thought about that before

429
00:35:54,922 --> 00:35:57,024
you went and got your revenge.

430
00:35:57,058 --> 00:35:58,758
What'd you think was gonna happen?

431
00:36:05,299 --> 00:36:09,502
Marine Corps Commendation Medal, Iraq, Afghanistan.

432
00:36:11,172 --> 00:36:13,506
Looks like you know how to handle yourself.

433
00:36:15,608 --> 00:36:16,944
That was a long time ago.

434
00:36:17,945 --> 00:36:19,246
This is where it's at now.

435
00:36:21,048 --> 00:36:23,616
You picked a hell of a crew to start a fight with.

436
00:36:29,156 --> 00:36:31,826
Got a squad car outside all night.

437
00:36:31,859 --> 00:36:33,626
You'll be safe.

438
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,062
This is far from over.

439
00:36:36,696 --> 00:36:37,874
I'll be back tomorrow with a lot more questions,

440
00:36:37,898 --> 00:36:39,934
and I want answers.

441
00:36:39,967 --> 00:36:41,634
You're gonna have to start talking to me,

442
00:36:41,668 --> 00:36:42,769
or to a judge.

443
00:37:17,071 --> 00:37:20,074
Nice wheels, goddamn!

444
00:37:20,774 --> 00:37:22,609
Well, I figured you'd pay me extra for it.

445
00:37:22,642 --> 00:37:24,879
You're funny, you're very funny.

446
00:37:24,912 --> 00:37:25,989
No, I'm serious.

447
00:37:26,013 --> 00:37:28,615
I'm just so glad you made it, right on time, man.

448
00:37:28,648 --> 00:37:32,619
The boat to Sierra Leone is leaving in about 15 minutes.

449
00:37:32,652 --> 00:37:34,021
Well, break me off, man.

450
00:37:34,055 --> 00:37:36,023
That thing's worth at least 20.

451
00:37:36,057 --> 00:37:37,992
Shit, the sticker says 70.

452
00:37:38,025 --> 00:37:39,960
I get paid when the boat leaves.

453
00:37:39,994 --> 00:37:42,029
I don't get paid, all right.

454
00:37:42,063 --> 00:37:43,030
You can still pay me, man.

455
00:37:43,064 --> 00:37:44,231
I know you got it.

456
00:37:44,265 --> 00:37:47,068
I don't get paid til the fucking car's in the container.

457
00:37:47,101 --> 00:37:48,635
- Fuck that.
- Come on.

458
00:37:48,668 --> 00:37:50,304
I'm not gonna Uber home with nothing.

459
00:37:50,337 --> 00:37:51,806
You know what, put some plates on it.

460
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:53,083
I'll drive this fucking thing home.

461
00:37:53,107 --> 00:37:54,942
Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.

462
00:37:55,608 --> 00:37:57,577
You're not going home with nothing.

463
00:37:58,279 --> 00:38:00,147
See, you're not going home with nothing.

464
00:38:00,181 --> 00:38:01,181
What's this?

465
00:38:03,084 --> 00:38:05,052
What it look like?

466
00:38:05,086 --> 00:38:06,126
It looks like an insult.

467
00:38:07,321 --> 00:38:09,323
Oh, okay, okay.

468
00:38:14,061 --> 00:38:15,830
I'll take that Mercedes.

469
00:38:15,863 --> 00:38:17,697
It belongs to somebody.

470
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:18,899
So did that.

471
00:38:18,933 --> 00:38:20,493
I'm sure that belonged to somebody, too.

472
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:24,238
Please, indulge.

473
00:38:30,244 --> 00:38:32,679
That's a lot of fucking money on the street.

474
00:38:37,451 --> 00:38:38,451
Looks Chinese.

475
00:38:40,054 --> 00:38:42,755
- That's a better market.
- Yeah.

476
00:38:42,789 --> 00:38:43,789
Fuck.

477
00:38:47,428 --> 00:38:48,428
You owe me, man.

478
00:38:49,964 --> 00:38:51,899
I know, I know, I know.

479
00:38:51,932 --> 00:38:52,932
Thank you very much.

480
00:38:53,934 --> 00:38:55,768
You owe me!

481
00:39:20,261 --> 00:39:22,062
You're drinking?

482
00:39:22,096 --> 00:39:23,096
Yep.

483
00:39:24,465 --> 00:39:26,367
You need to tell me what's going on.

484
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:34,208
If you knew, you wouldn't look at me the same way again.

485
00:39:35,342 --> 00:39:39,079
William, hey, I love you.

486
00:39:41,048 --> 00:39:43,918
You are my husband, and whatever's going on,

487
00:39:43,951 --> 00:39:45,052
we are in it together.

488
00:39:48,822 --> 00:39:51,292
I feel like I'm right back in the Middle East

489
00:39:51,325 --> 00:39:52,426
in a fucking war zone.

490
00:39:53,127 --> 00:39:55,029
What are you talking about?

491
00:39:55,062 --> 00:39:57,464
You don't wanna know, Jen, you don't.

492
00:39:58,465 --> 00:40:00,034
I do.

493
00:40:06,507 --> 00:40:07,507
I killed him.

494
00:40:10,077 --> 00:40:12,947
I killed Danny Fetter.

495
00:40:17,952 --> 00:40:19,853
He took our baby away.

496
00:40:19,887 --> 00:40:23,490
He was gonna go away for five to seven years, maximum.

497
00:40:24,525 --> 00:40:26,026
It wasn't fair.

498
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:26,961
- William-
- It wasn't fair!

499
00:40:26,994 --> 00:40:28,594
William, I don't know what you.

500
00:40:33,467 --> 00:40:35,336
And now the rest of them want my head.

501
00:40:35,369 --> 00:40:36,837
Well, do we need to leave?

502
00:40:38,072 --> 00:40:39,139
Where are we gonna go?

503
00:40:39,173 --> 00:40:41,117
Yeah, well, we can't stay here if it's not safe.

504
00:40:41,141 --> 00:40:42,409
There's a squad car outside.

505
00:40:42,443 --> 00:40:46,046
We'll be fine, but first thing in the morning,

506
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,082
go to your folks, at least for tonight.

507
00:40:54,088 --> 00:40:55,198
And I take it back to the store,

508
00:40:55,222 --> 00:40:58,025
and I tell this moron kid like, "Hey, broke again."

509
00:40:58,726 --> 00:41:01,395
And this dummy kid says I didn't install it properly

510
00:41:01,428 --> 00:41:04,031
and because I, oh shit!

511
00:41:04,064 --> 00:41:05,299
No fucking way!

512
00:41:06,934 --> 00:41:09,036
That prick threw the fucking bottle at us.

513
00:41:18,412 --> 00:41:19,480
Why did they leave?

514
00:41:23,884 --> 00:41:25,953
Hello, hello.

515
00:41:34,295 --> 00:41:35,929
Don't make that phone call.

516
00:41:36,864 --> 00:41:37,864
Give me the phones.

517
00:41:39,066 --> 00:41:40,567
Give me the phone!

518
00:41:41,869 --> 00:41:42,869
Both of you.

519
00:41:43,604 --> 00:41:44,604
Yours.

520
00:41:46,106 --> 00:41:47,106
Thank you.

521
00:41:48,075 --> 00:41:49,910
Can I call you Bill?

522
00:41:49,943 --> 00:41:50,943
William?

523
00:41:51,412 --> 00:41:53,047
How about Willy?

524
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,482
I don't know, Donnie, whatever you prefer.

525
00:41:57,484 --> 00:41:58,484
I like Willy.

526
00:41:59,386 --> 00:42:01,055
Yeah.

527
00:42:01,088 --> 00:42:02,088
Rory.

528
00:42:04,491 --> 00:42:06,927
Don't believe everything you read.

529
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,862
I'm a very nice guy.

530
00:42:08,896 --> 00:42:11,165
Listen, this is just between you and me.

531
00:42:12,433 --> 00:42:13,834
Leave my wife out of it.

532
00:42:14,902 --> 00:42:18,072
Jen, go, go-
- No, no, no.

533
00:42:18,105 --> 00:42:23,077
It's about quality time with family, right, Jennifer?

534
00:42:23,544 --> 00:42:25,579
Or Jenny, Jen?

535
00:42:28,515 --> 00:42:33,253
Did you know that your husband killed my son?

536
00:42:33,287 --> 00:42:36,123
Only because your son killed my daughter.

537
00:42:36,156 --> 00:42:37,624
Well, he was my son.

538
00:42:40,027 --> 00:42:43,030
Why do you look so angry, William, huh?

539
00:42:44,498 --> 00:42:46,100
You're the one who did the killing.

540
00:42:47,101 --> 00:42:48,235
Don't be angry.

541
00:42:48,268 --> 00:42:49,403
It'll all be over soon.

542
00:42:54,541 --> 00:42:57,544
You got the good shit, fancy.

543
00:42:58,512 --> 00:43:00,214
We drink cheap shit.

544
00:43:01,115 --> 00:43:03,050
I like the gasoline taste.

545
00:43:04,184 --> 00:43:05,686
But that's just me.

546
00:43:11,091 --> 00:43:13,127
No, goddamn!

547
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:17,631
No, no, no, no, no, sit down.

548
00:43:17,664 --> 00:43:21,568
Get down, no, no, no, no, Willy, down on your knees.

549
00:43:21,602 --> 00:43:22,236
She had nothing to do with it.

550
00:43:22,269 --> 00:43:24,471
Beg for your fucking life.

551
00:43:24,505 --> 00:43:25,639
Say hello to my son.

552
00:43:48,362 --> 00:43:50,397
Do you see the light, Willy?

553
00:43:50,431 --> 00:43:55,436
Is it everything they say it is, huh, huh?

554
00:43:57,104 --> 00:43:59,573
I can't wait to celebrate death.

555
00:44:01,542 --> 00:44:05,546
For now, I act as its executioner.

556
00:44:07,047 --> 00:44:08,115
Fuck you.

557
00:44:08,148 --> 00:44:10,451
Mm, that's what you wanna use as your last words?

558
00:44:12,219 --> 00:44:13,454
You should enjoy this.

559
00:45:14,114 --> 00:45:16,350
911,
what's your emergency?

560
00:45:17,317 --> 00:45:20,053
Hello?
- Help.

561
00:45:20,087 --> 00:45:20,922
- Sir?
- Help.

562
00:45:20,955 --> 00:45:23,090
Sir, are you all right?

563
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:41,843
Mr. Duncan, oh, God, Mr. Duncan!

564
00:45:41,876 --> 00:45:43,410
You're gonna injure yourself.

565
00:45:43,443 --> 00:45:44,478
Here, come on.

566
00:45:44,511 --> 00:45:47,614
Let's get up, let's get you back in bed, come on.

567
00:45:47,648 --> 00:45:51,084
Help, help, help, help, I need some help in here!

568
00:45:51,118 --> 00:45:52,252
Oh, easy.

569
00:45:52,286 --> 00:45:54,087
Help!
- It's okay.

570
00:45:54,121 --> 00:45:54,755
Calm down,

571
00:45:54,788 --> 00:45:56,123
calm down.
- Why?

572
00:45:56,156 --> 00:45:58,225
Doctor, Doctor!

573
00:45:58,258 --> 00:46:01,094
It's okay, easy, easy.

574
00:46:01,128 --> 00:46:02,596
Okay, help me strap him in.

575
00:46:02,629 --> 00:46:04,097
He's having a manic episode.

576
00:46:04,131 --> 00:46:05,131
Come on, sir.

577
00:46:05,833 --> 00:46:08,135
10 milligrams Haloperidol.

578
00:46:09,503 --> 00:46:11,371
- Got it!
- And get some Ketamine.

579
00:46:11,405 --> 00:46:13,507
Breathe with me, come on, sir.

580
00:46:15,442 --> 00:46:17,544
It's gonna make you feel better, calm down.

581
00:46:20,815 --> 00:46:22,182
I don't wanna be alive.

582
00:46:22,215 --> 00:46:23,450
You are alive.

583
00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:27,154
I don't wanna be.

584
00:46:41,234 --> 00:46:42,904
Look at the miracle man.

585
00:46:42,937 --> 00:46:43,937
Miracle?

586
00:46:44,906 --> 00:46:46,139
You're still alive.

587
00:46:48,208 --> 00:46:49,208
Yeah.

588
00:46:50,711 --> 00:46:52,145
So, is it over?

589
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,681
Okay, let's give this a try, okay?

590
00:46:55,616 --> 00:46:58,151
Come on, take it slow, no rush.

591
00:46:58,953 --> 00:46:59,953
Good start.

592
00:47:03,925 --> 00:47:04,892
Sure.

593
00:47:04,926 --> 00:47:07,794
One step at a time, there you go.

594
00:47:07,829 --> 00:47:08,896
Baby steps, no rush.

595
00:47:10,965 --> 00:47:11,933
Good.

596
00:47:11,966 --> 00:47:13,667
Somehow, I don't believe you.

597
00:47:16,938 --> 00:47:18,672
I don't even think you believe you.

598
00:47:22,242 --> 00:47:26,146
There's gonna be a photo with you dead

599
00:47:27,949 --> 00:47:29,149
if you keep going.

600
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:31,785
Yeah.

601
00:47:32,854 --> 00:47:33,921
There you go.

602
00:47:34,922 --> 00:47:36,790
One step at a time.

603
00:47:36,824 --> 00:47:38,492
We both know that.

604
00:47:41,929 --> 00:47:43,697
It's your choice.

605
00:47:58,946 --> 00:48:02,884
Okay, looking good.

606
00:48:02,917 --> 00:48:04,886
Looking really good, Will.

607
00:48:04,919 --> 00:48:05,853
You don't have to lie to me.

608
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:08,890
I'm not lying to you, you're doing great.

609
00:48:08,923 --> 00:48:11,425
You're gonna be outta here before you know it.

610
00:48:14,862 --> 00:48:17,230
Yeah, that's the plan.

611
00:49:55,362 --> 00:49:56,429
That's fucked, man.

612
00:49:57,899 --> 00:49:59,566
Somebody's luggage and shit.

613
00:51:10,004 --> 00:51:11,806
Hey, yo!

614
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:14,175
Who are you?

615
00:51:14,208 --> 00:51:16,878
Hey!

616
00:51:16,911 --> 00:51:18,179
Who are you?

617
00:51:18,212 --> 00:51:18,846
Hey!

618
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:20,948
I asked you a question, man.

619
00:51:20,982 --> 00:51:21,916
I don't want any trouble.

620
00:51:21,949 --> 00:51:23,050
I'm nobody.

621
00:51:23,084 --> 00:51:25,052
Motherfucker, why you lying?

622
00:51:25,086 --> 00:51:26,988
Shit, you think I'm stupid?

623
00:51:27,021 --> 00:51:28,823
Come here, hey!

624
00:51:28,856 --> 00:51:29,856
Check this out.

625
00:51:31,225 --> 00:51:32,225
That's you.

626
00:51:35,963 --> 00:51:36,964
What are you doing here?

627
00:51:38,199 --> 00:51:38,798
It's been a long day.

628
00:51:38,833 --> 00:51:40,134
I don't want any trouble.

629
00:51:40,167 --> 00:51:41,735
Oh, looks like you got it, man.

630
00:51:41,768 --> 00:51:43,804
Plenty of trouble from what I can see.

631
00:51:43,838 --> 00:51:46,007
You in hot water with them Fetter boys, huh?

632
00:51:47,909 --> 00:51:49,977
Yeah, maybe I can help you.

633
00:51:52,013 --> 00:51:53,680
I don't need any help, either.

634
00:51:53,713 --> 00:51:55,415
Okay, Willy, all right.

635
00:51:56,951 --> 00:51:57,951
You do you.

636
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:04,959
You know what?

637
00:52:06,093 --> 00:52:10,164
You know where I can get a gun?

638
00:52:13,968 --> 00:52:16,469
Motherfucker, step into my office.

639
00:52:16,503 --> 00:52:20,674
Yeah, I had a little run-in myself with them Fetter boys.

640
00:52:20,707 --> 00:52:22,810
Yeah, you know what I'm talking about.

641
00:52:22,843 --> 00:52:24,946
Rory, yeah.

642
00:52:24,979 --> 00:52:30,117
Motherfucker shot me, yeah, right here, in the shoulder.

643
00:52:30,151 --> 00:52:31,218
Three years ago.

644
00:52:33,988 --> 00:52:35,056
Motherfucking asshole.

645
00:52:35,089 --> 00:52:36,958
Then he killed my fucking cousin.

646
00:52:37,992 --> 00:52:40,161
Fuck, man, hate them guys.

647
00:52:42,997 --> 00:52:46,901
Yeah, it all comes down to pain and pleasure, my man.

648
00:52:48,169 --> 00:52:49,236
Pain and pleasure?

649
00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:50,237
Yeah.

650
00:52:50,271 --> 00:52:52,974
How much pain you wanna inflict on that fucker,

651
00:52:53,773 --> 00:52:56,143
and how much pleasure you want to derive

652
00:52:56,177 --> 00:52:57,777
from inflicting said pain.

653
00:53:00,915 --> 00:53:02,984
Yeah, be my motherfucking guest.

654
00:53:05,286 --> 00:53:06,954
That's a Glock Nine.

655
00:53:06,988 --> 00:53:08,755
You can tell by the sound.

656
00:53:08,788 --> 00:53:11,558
That's one of the most reliable stingers on the street.

657
00:53:11,591 --> 00:53:13,894
Most cops carry that exact same model right there.

658
00:53:13,928 --> 00:53:15,172
That gun's so reliable you could drop

659
00:53:15,196 --> 00:53:16,964
that in a pan of pancake batter,

660
00:53:16,998 --> 00:53:18,933
lift it up, it'll still bang bang.

661
00:53:19,799 --> 00:53:22,003
Not that I would recommend doing that.

662
00:53:25,272 --> 00:53:27,942
Yeah, you look like you know what you're doing.

663
00:53:27,975 --> 00:53:29,977
Cop, cop, you ain't a cop.

664
00:53:30,011 --> 00:53:31,812
You a cop?

665
00:53:31,846 --> 00:53:34,015
No, served, long time ago.

666
00:53:35,983 --> 00:53:36,984
You kill anybody?

667
00:53:37,985 --> 00:53:38,953
I was a marine.

668
00:53:38,986 --> 00:53:39,986
So you killed people.

669
00:53:41,989 --> 00:53:45,960
I know, shit, you ain't fucking around, huh?

670
00:53:45,993 --> 00:53:48,295
No, sir, I am not fucking around.

671
00:53:49,796 --> 00:53:52,967
Willy, you can call me Dante.

672
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,970
Okay, Dante, I would like to purchase

673
00:53:56,003 --> 00:53:57,972
all of your guns and munitions.

674
00:53:58,005 --> 00:53:59,306
How much would that cost?

675
00:54:00,041 --> 00:54:02,742
Yeah, you're gonna need 'em, man,

676
00:54:02,776 --> 00:54:05,813
going up against the Fetter gang.

677
00:54:05,846 --> 00:54:08,115
Yeah, they some bad apples, man.

678
00:54:08,149 --> 00:54:12,619
So many guns, they have many guns.

679
00:54:13,988 --> 00:54:15,856
All right, I'm gonna hook you up.

680
00:54:15,890 --> 00:54:16,857
What's that saying?

681
00:54:16,891 --> 00:54:18,826
The enemy of my enemy is my friend's enemy,

682
00:54:18,859 --> 00:54:20,127
or some shit like that.

683
00:54:20,161 --> 00:54:21,961
All right, give me 10 grand for the whole lot.

684
00:54:26,834 --> 00:54:27,968
There's 10 right there.

685
00:54:28,002 --> 00:54:30,237
Wait a second.

686
00:54:31,638 --> 00:54:32,638
Let me see that.

687
00:54:37,011 --> 00:54:38,012
Shit!

688
00:54:39,712 --> 00:54:41,614
I should've asked for more money, man.

689
00:54:43,017 --> 00:54:45,618
Man, anything else I can get you, rich boy?

690
00:54:45,652 --> 00:54:48,055
Nope, not unless you can get me a car.

691
00:54:48,089 --> 00:54:50,858
Let me guess, you want one of them

692
00:54:50,891 --> 00:54:52,102
cars with no name on it, right?

693
00:54:52,126 --> 00:54:53,793
You wanna keep it clean.

694
00:54:53,828 --> 00:54:55,229
That would be preferable.

695
00:54:55,262 --> 00:54:56,230
Shit, man, I got you covered.

696
00:54:56,263 --> 00:54:58,966
You want a sandwich with that, too?

697
00:54:58,999 --> 00:55:00,359
How about the car and the jacket.

698
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:05,306
Man, I love that jacket, man.

699
00:55:05,339 --> 00:55:07,374
This jacket right here, this has been

700
00:55:07,408 --> 00:55:09,009
in my family for three generations.

701
00:55:09,043 --> 00:55:11,312
My grandfather wore this jacket.

702
00:55:58,192 --> 00:55:59,960
Open or closed?

703
00:56:18,946 --> 00:56:19,946
Open

704
00:56:21,015 --> 00:56:22,149
or closed?

705
00:56:27,988 --> 00:56:31,425
Open or closed?

706
00:56:35,095 --> 00:56:36,964
Open or closed!

707
00:56:42,102 --> 00:56:43,370
Open or closed?

708
00:57:20,541 --> 00:57:21,976
The fuck is this?

709
00:57:24,011 --> 00:57:25,879
You're light again.

710
00:57:25,913 --> 00:57:27,848
No, it's not light.

711
00:57:27,881 --> 00:57:29,149
A shame about Danny.

712
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:33,820
He had potential.

713
00:57:35,889 --> 00:57:40,127
Danny was pure, but too much like me.

714
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,963
Well, Danny's dead, Pop.

715
00:57:50,204 --> 00:57:51,905
And whose fault is that?

716
00:57:53,841 --> 00:57:56,043
You were supposed to watch his back.

717
00:57:56,076 --> 00:57:57,244
It should've been you.

718
00:57:58,178 --> 00:58:00,314
Yeah, maybe it should've been.

719
00:58:01,382 --> 00:58:03,450
Maybe it should've been you, too.

720
00:58:03,484 --> 00:58:05,019
Get the fuck outta my face.

721
01:00:20,587 --> 01:00:22,156
What the?

722
01:00:45,112 --> 01:00:47,014
You come into my home, motherfucker?

723
01:00:47,047 --> 01:00:48,148
I'll fucking kill you!

724
01:00:59,059 --> 01:01:00,661
I'm gonna fuck you!

725
01:01:24,451 --> 01:01:26,587
Oh, you motherfucker, come here!

726
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:35,295
Oh, fuck, why'd you shoot me?

727
01:01:38,265 --> 01:01:42,269
Oh, fuck.

728
01:01:42,302 --> 01:01:46,340
Oh, oh, fuck, oh, goddamn.

729
01:01:46,373 --> 01:01:51,345
Oh, fuck, oh, goddamn, oh, fuck, you hit me good.

730
01:01:51,545 --> 01:01:53,680
Oh, shit, I need an ambulance.

731
01:01:53,714 --> 01:01:55,115
Oh, I need an ambulance.

732
01:01:55,148 --> 01:01:57,050
You fucking shot me twice!

733
01:01:59,353 --> 01:02:00,630
I need you to tell me where he is.

734
01:02:00,654 --> 01:02:02,089
Fuck you, I need an ambulance!

735
01:02:02,122 --> 01:02:05,425
Oh, God!

736
01:02:05,459 --> 01:02:07,261
Where is Rory?

737
01:02:07,294 --> 01:02:09,096
Okay, okay, all right.

738
01:02:10,597 --> 01:02:13,667
If I tell you, you promise you'll call an ambulance?

739
01:02:14,568 --> 01:02:15,669
I won't die like this.

740
01:02:17,504 --> 01:02:20,207
Yes, Zachary, I can do that.

741
01:02:22,543 --> 01:02:23,710
You promise?

742
01:02:27,882 --> 01:02:28,816
He's probably at the club.

743
01:02:28,850 --> 01:02:30,117
He's always fucking there.

744
01:02:31,351 --> 01:02:32,386
Club?

745
01:02:32,419 --> 01:02:34,822
Fuck, fuck, it's their club, man!

746
01:02:34,856 --> 01:02:37,357
What?

747
01:02:44,665 --> 01:02:45,665
Thanks.

748
01:02:46,868 --> 01:02:49,236
Okay, okay, make the call.

749
01:02:49,269 --> 01:02:49,871
Make the call.

750
01:02:49,904 --> 01:02:51,438
Where's my phone?

751
01:02:51,471 --> 01:02:53,841
Fuck.

752
01:02:53,875 --> 01:02:55,175
Come on, come on.

753
01:02:55,208 --> 01:02:57,244
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

754
01:02:57,277 --> 01:02:59,112
We had a fucking deal, man.

755
01:02:59,146 --> 01:03:01,114
Please, you don't have to do this.

756
01:03:01,148 --> 01:03:02,850
You don't, please.

757
01:03:02,884 --> 01:03:04,484
I have a daughter.

758
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:11,124
Fuck.

759
01:03:11,158 --> 01:03:12,225
Thank you.

760
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:20,868
Open or closed?

761
01:03:22,870 --> 01:03:23,870
What?

762
01:03:25,272 --> 01:03:26,306
Your casket.

763
01:03:27,875 --> 01:03:30,177
You want it open or closed?

764
01:04:28,769 --> 01:04:30,905
Another one of Fetter's boys.

765
01:04:30,938 --> 01:04:32,205
Yep.

766
01:04:34,708 --> 01:04:35,776
Pardon me.

767
01:04:44,584 --> 01:04:45,987
Detective Neil Chen.

768
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:47,421
Are you Donald Fetter?

769
01:04:49,991 --> 01:04:51,458
What are you here for?

770
01:04:51,491 --> 01:04:53,493
It seems your son Rory and his friends

771
01:04:53,527 --> 01:04:54,938
are in the middle of a little conflict

772
01:04:54,962 --> 01:04:57,631
with a gentleman by the name of William Duncan.

773
01:05:01,568 --> 01:05:02,904
I know all about William.

774
01:05:03,905 --> 01:05:05,305
He killed my son.

775
01:05:06,974 --> 01:05:08,742
I thought he died.

776
01:05:08,775 --> 01:05:10,878
No, he's very much alive.

777
01:05:10,912 --> 01:05:13,915
I think he just killed another one of your son's friends.

778
01:05:15,515 --> 01:05:16,316
I'll be blunt.

779
01:05:16,349 --> 01:05:17,819
I'm here on a mission of goodwill

780
01:05:17,852 --> 01:05:20,420
to end this war, both sides.

781
01:05:20,454 --> 01:05:21,688
I just want it to stop.

782
01:05:22,489 --> 01:05:27,461
Whatever my son has done, that's his business.

783
01:05:27,494 --> 01:05:29,496
I'm not sure I can help.

784
01:05:30,164 --> 01:05:30,965
You can see yourself out.

785
01:05:30,998 --> 01:05:34,234
Sir, I need to speak with your son.

786
01:05:37,004 --> 01:05:38,371
I'm not here to arrest him.

787
01:05:38,405 --> 01:05:40,674
If I were, I wouldn't be here alone.

788
01:05:40,707 --> 01:05:41,876
Why should I trust you?

789
01:05:41,909 --> 01:05:43,310
I know who you are, Donnie.

790
01:05:43,343 --> 01:05:44,879
I know all about you.

791
01:05:44,912 --> 01:05:45,913
Every cop does.

792
01:05:48,015 --> 01:05:52,920
And I know that we allow you to do what you do,

793
01:05:53,855 --> 01:05:55,455
and I know that that can change.

794
01:05:56,523 --> 01:05:57,859
Do you want that to change?

795
01:06:07,434 --> 01:06:08,735
Get your ass in here.

796
01:06:08,769 --> 01:06:09,871
Sure.

797
01:06:11,772 --> 01:06:12,773
He'll be right in.

798
01:06:24,451 --> 01:06:26,686
Who the fuck is this guy?

799
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:28,823
Rory Fetter, Detective Chen.

800
01:06:31,358 --> 01:06:32,359
The fuck do you want?

801
01:06:32,392 --> 01:06:34,427
I know all about your war with William Duncan.

802
01:06:34,461 --> 01:06:35,461
My war?

803
01:06:36,898 --> 01:06:40,835
If I read the papers correctly, William Duncan is deceased.

804
01:06:40,868 --> 01:06:43,737
Oh, no, he's not.

805
01:06:43,770 --> 01:06:45,772
In fact, he just killed your buddy Zach.

806
01:06:48,075 --> 01:06:49,877
- Zach's dead?
- Yeah.

807
01:06:50,644 --> 01:06:53,413
Shot three times today, just now, in fact.

808
01:06:53,446 --> 01:06:54,347
Then why are you here?

809
01:06:54,381 --> 01:06:57,450
Why aren't you out chasing this murderer?

810
01:06:57,484 --> 01:06:58,552
Don't know where he is.

811
01:06:58,585 --> 01:06:59,954
He escaped the hospital.

812
01:06:59,987 --> 01:07:03,356
The one that you sent him to when you shot him,

813
01:07:03,390 --> 01:07:04,859
murdered his wife.

814
01:07:04,892 --> 01:07:05,893
Allegedly.

815
01:07:07,995 --> 01:07:10,865
So, you felt that it was a good idea

816
01:07:10,898 --> 01:07:14,869
to come to our place of business

817
01:07:14,902 --> 01:07:17,972
and tell us that this fuck-face

818
01:07:18,005 --> 01:07:20,674
who killed one of my friends is on the loose

819
01:07:20,707 --> 01:07:21,843
and you can't catch him?

820
01:07:21,876 --> 01:07:24,846
Listen, I'm actually here on a mission of goodwill,

821
01:07:24,879 --> 01:07:26,646
'cause I want this all to end.

822
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:27,849
He's not gonna stop.

823
01:07:27,882 --> 01:07:29,482
So I'm here to tell you that maybe you

824
01:07:29,516 --> 01:07:30,885
should disappear for a while.

825
01:07:35,488 --> 01:07:36,488
Is that all?

826
01:07:38,893 --> 01:07:41,028
Yeah, that's all.

827
01:07:44,098 --> 01:07:45,098
Enjoy your day.

828
01:07:51,806 --> 01:07:52,439
The fuck is this?

829
01:07:52,472 --> 01:07:53,908
This guy trying to scare us?

830
01:07:56,143 --> 01:07:58,045
I want you to kill that prick.

831
01:08:02,049 --> 01:08:03,683
Get it over with.

832
01:08:03,717 --> 01:08:04,852
Go.

833
01:08:06,486 --> 01:08:07,754
Right.

834
01:08:08,923 --> 01:08:10,757
'Cause I fucking do everything.

835
01:08:10,790 --> 01:08:12,159
Right, yeah.

836
01:08:56,170 --> 01:08:57,604
Evening, Detective.

837
01:08:59,941 --> 01:09:01,675
Gun wasn't cheap.

838
01:09:02,642 --> 01:09:03,844
You're telling me.

839
01:09:15,923 --> 01:09:18,059
What the hell are you doing here?

840
01:09:18,092 --> 01:09:20,027
You working for them?

841
01:09:20,061 --> 01:09:21,494
What?

842
01:09:21,528 --> 01:09:22,728
You a crooked cop?

843
01:09:23,496 --> 01:09:25,799
No, man, I'm trying to fucking help you.

844
01:09:26,867 --> 01:09:29,769
I want this to stop, I want all of this to stop.

845
01:09:29,803 --> 01:09:32,772
I saw you at the club.

846
01:09:32,807 --> 01:09:34,809
I went to tell them about Zach.

847
01:09:35,475 --> 01:09:37,211
They deserve to know what happened.

848
01:09:39,646 --> 01:09:41,781
How far are you gonna take this?

849
01:09:41,816 --> 01:09:43,550
However far it goes, it goes.

850
01:09:44,218 --> 01:09:46,753
They took everything from me,

851
01:09:46,786 --> 01:09:47,898
and it's only a matter of time

852
01:09:47,922 --> 01:09:49,622
before they do it to somebody else.

853
01:09:49,656 --> 01:09:51,158
You gotta let this go.

854
01:09:55,762 --> 01:09:56,762
Yeah.

855
01:09:57,932 --> 01:09:59,910
You know what, I didn't think of that, you're right.

856
01:09:59,934 --> 01:10:01,135
I should fucking let it go.

857
01:10:02,103 --> 01:10:05,239
Are you even fucking listening to anything I'm saying?

858
01:10:08,641 --> 01:10:09,641
Let it go?

859
01:10:10,277 --> 01:10:11,912
You know what these people do!

860
01:10:15,715 --> 01:10:18,152
- I know.
- Yeah, you know.

861
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:21,055
In fact, there have been other initiation murders

862
01:10:21,088 --> 01:10:24,058
just like this, and I knew it was them,

863
01:10:24,091 --> 01:10:26,861
but nothing ever fucking sticks with these guys.

864
01:10:31,664 --> 01:10:33,134
Well, well done, Barney Fife.

865
01:10:34,068 --> 01:10:38,139
Doing such a great job of protecting my community!

866
01:10:41,942 --> 01:10:43,944
I cannot let you keep going like this.

867
01:10:45,146 --> 01:10:46,180
You know that.

868
01:10:46,213 --> 01:10:47,213
I'll stop.

869
01:10:49,984 --> 01:10:51,318
It'll all be over very soon.

870
01:10:53,220 --> 01:10:54,597
But I'm telling you now, if you get in my way,

871
01:10:54,621 --> 01:10:55,890
I will fucking kill you.

872
01:10:57,091 --> 01:10:58,091
You understand me?

873
01:10:59,692 --> 01:11:00,794
Yeah, I understand.

874
01:11:03,831 --> 01:11:04,932
Good.

875
01:11:04,965 --> 01:11:07,935
Now I don't wanna see you again until this is over.

876
01:11:08,735 --> 01:11:10,703
Then I'll turn myself in, I'll go to jail.

877
01:11:10,737 --> 01:11:11,915
You can give me the lethal injection.

878
01:11:11,939 --> 01:11:13,007
I don't fucking care.

879
01:11:14,408 --> 01:11:18,012
But right now, you need to do one thing.

880
01:11:18,045 --> 01:11:19,180
You look the other way.

881
01:11:27,988 --> 01:11:28,988
All right.

882
01:11:31,892 --> 01:11:33,227
Go and get this over with.

883
01:11:34,895 --> 01:11:35,996
Quick.

884
01:11:57,852 --> 01:11:58,852
Get in here.

885
01:12:02,923 --> 01:12:03,923
Sit down.

886
01:12:07,228 --> 01:12:08,795
Why are you still here?

887
01:12:10,931 --> 01:12:11,698
What?

888
01:12:11,731 --> 01:12:12,500
You just asked me to come in here.

889
01:12:12,533 --> 01:12:15,269
Go take care of William Duncan.

890
01:12:15,302 --> 01:12:16,871
Don't worry about it.

891
01:12:16,904 --> 01:12:17,872
I'll take care of him.

892
01:12:17,905 --> 01:12:19,106
Just kill him.

893
01:12:20,107 --> 01:12:21,876
What the fuck's wrong with you?

894
01:12:21,909 --> 01:12:22,910
He's one man.

895
01:12:23,911 --> 01:12:25,045
I'll take care of it.

896
01:12:28,249 --> 01:12:29,350
Just fucking bounce.

897
01:12:32,253 --> 01:12:33,253
Kill the prick.

898
01:12:34,922 --> 01:12:38,658
You're my son, goddamn it, act like it for once.

899
01:12:41,761 --> 01:12:42,761
I'm your son.

900
01:12:45,966 --> 01:12:47,434
Pussy.

901
01:13:10,958 --> 01:13:12,759
Hey, my brother!

902
01:13:12,792 --> 01:13:14,895
You gotta let me in there!

903
01:13:14,929 --> 01:13:16,363
My girl is in there!

904
01:13:16,397 --> 01:13:17,998
Hell, all my girls.

905
01:13:18,032 --> 01:13:19,766
I'm VIP!

906
01:13:19,799 --> 01:13:20,935
Oh, let me in, man.

907
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:00,940
Shit.

908
01:14:08,949 --> 01:14:09,950
You got me.

909
01:14:11,819 --> 01:14:13,020
Looks that way.

910
01:14:16,090 --> 01:14:17,858
Get it over with.

911
01:14:24,198 --> 01:14:26,200
I don't feel anything.

912
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:34,942
I'm serious, Donnie.

913
01:14:37,211 --> 01:14:38,211
Nothing.

914
01:14:41,048 --> 01:14:43,350
You know, they say the first time is the hardest.

915
01:14:46,287 --> 01:14:49,857
When I killed your son Danny, I was emotional.

916
01:14:53,394 --> 01:14:54,828
It felt...

917
01:14:56,964 --> 01:14:59,799
...I think the word is visceral.

918
01:15:02,236 --> 01:15:03,904
Cathartic.

919
01:15:03,937 --> 01:15:04,937
Yes.

920
01:15:05,472 --> 01:15:08,108
But now I'm sitting here in front of you.

921
01:15:10,577 --> 01:15:11,577
Nothing.

922
01:15:15,949 --> 01:15:17,418
Not even a shake.

923
01:15:17,451 --> 01:15:18,485
Is this what happens?

924
01:15:19,953 --> 01:15:20,954
Is this normal?

925
01:15:22,256 --> 01:15:23,256
You tell me.

926
01:15:25,959 --> 01:15:27,561
How many people you killed?

927
01:15:27,594 --> 01:15:29,897
Hmm, do you remember?

928
01:15:32,666 --> 01:15:34,935
How'd it feel when you killed my wife?

929
01:15:34,968 --> 01:15:36,937
Enough of this shit.

930
01:15:36,970 --> 01:15:37,971
You feel numb then?

931
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:44,411
'Cause I feel numb at the prospect of killing you.

932
01:15:50,951 --> 01:15:54,221
You know, I feel a little disappointed.

933
01:15:56,223 --> 01:15:57,925
Just kill me.

934
01:16:05,966 --> 01:16:07,334
- Hell no!
- Shit, man!

935
01:16:07,368 --> 01:16:08,635
Go, go, go, go, go!

936
01:16:08,669 --> 01:16:09,636
Go, go!

937
01:16:16,977 --> 01:16:17,644
Nothing.

938
01:16:53,714 --> 01:16:55,215
Hey.

939
01:16:55,249 --> 01:16:56,609
Hello, Rory.

940
01:16:58,185 --> 01:16:59,720
Who's this?

941
01:16:59,753 --> 01:17:00,753
Who do you think?

942
01:17:06,026 --> 01:17:07,628
Did you kill him?

943
01:17:08,762 --> 01:17:09,762
Yep.

944
01:17:11,765 --> 01:17:14,234
Well, then I'm talking to a fucking dead man.

945
01:17:14,268 --> 01:17:15,708
You can't kill what's already dead.

946
01:17:25,245 --> 01:17:26,246
Change of plans.

947
01:17:28,449 --> 01:17:29,516
Get back to the club.

948
01:17:31,752 --> 01:17:32,586
My man.

949
01:18:10,190 --> 01:18:11,190
Oh, fuck!

950
01:18:32,847 --> 01:18:33,847
Sorry, brother.

951
01:18:35,850 --> 01:18:37,284
What are you sorry for?

952
01:18:40,787 --> 01:18:45,792
He was a shit father and a despicable human being.

953
01:18:49,796 --> 01:18:51,131
But that's not the point.

954
01:18:52,766 --> 01:18:53,367
You can't kill

955
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:55,569
what's already dead, Rory.

956
01:19:09,884 --> 01:19:11,285
Find him!

957
01:19:11,318 --> 01:19:14,087
Yeah, let's roll, let's roll.

958
01:20:15,850 --> 01:20:17,784
Fuck, motherfucker!

959
01:20:17,819 --> 01:20:19,219
Get off me!

960
01:20:19,252 --> 01:20:20,763
I'm walking out with him, Rory!

961
01:20:20,787 --> 01:20:23,724
The fuck off me, motherfucker!

962
01:20:23,757 --> 01:20:24,791
You're fucking dead.

963
01:20:29,396 --> 01:20:30,797
I'll fucking kill him!

964
01:20:32,633 --> 01:20:33,633
So will I.

965
01:21:58,585 --> 01:22:00,955
Rory, I saw that guy again.

966
01:22:07,527 --> 01:22:09,296
Yo, it's me.

967
01:22:09,329 --> 01:22:10,329
Come in!

968
01:22:13,835 --> 01:22:15,635
You got shot.

969
01:22:15,669 --> 01:22:16,669
No shit.

970
01:22:17,939 --> 01:22:19,306
Where'd they get ya?

971
01:22:19,339 --> 01:22:21,541
Shoulder, I can't reach it.

972
01:22:21,575 --> 01:22:23,978
Wow, little bit of a problem, huh?

973
01:22:24,011 --> 01:22:25,555
Yeah, when you get shot in the back like that,

974
01:22:25,579 --> 01:22:26,824
like, hell, what are you gonna do?

975
01:22:26,848 --> 01:22:28,582
Come on, stand up.

976
01:22:29,449 --> 01:22:30,818
Okay, sorry.

977
01:22:30,852 --> 01:22:32,552
Can I take a look?

978
01:22:33,988 --> 01:22:34,822
Oh, man.

979
01:22:34,856 --> 01:22:36,523
Man, that's in there deep.

980
01:22:37,859 --> 01:22:41,896
You think you can get it out with these?

981
01:22:41,929 --> 01:22:43,363
I ain't no doctor, man.

982
01:22:43,396 --> 01:22:44,798
I don't care, just try.

983
01:22:44,832 --> 01:22:45,799
Just do it.

984
01:23:27,008 --> 01:23:27,809
Anything?

985
01:23:27,842 --> 01:23:29,543
It's empty.

986
01:23:40,922 --> 01:23:43,557
That's the best I can do under the circumstances.

987
01:23:54,168 --> 01:23:55,937
How are you today, sir?

988
01:23:55,970 --> 01:23:59,372
Do you by any chance know who owns that brown car out there?

989
01:24:00,975 --> 01:24:03,677
What is the license plate?

990
01:24:06,546 --> 01:24:09,416
4-4-0-6-2.

991
01:24:13,855 --> 01:24:17,624
I don't know, it's not in the system.

992
01:24:17,657 --> 01:24:18,658
That's okay.

993
01:24:18,692 --> 01:24:21,695
Thank you.

994
01:24:21,728 --> 01:24:22,864
Yo, what the fuck, man?

995
01:24:24,764 --> 01:24:25,764
He didn't know.

996
01:24:36,878 --> 01:24:37,879
Look at that shit.

997
01:24:39,947 --> 01:24:40,848
Can I keep this?

998
01:24:51,691 --> 01:24:53,727
Willy!

999
01:24:57,098 --> 01:25:00,835
Oh, Willy, Willy boy!

1000
01:25:00,868 --> 01:25:01,869
Who the fuck is that?

1001
01:25:02,870 --> 01:25:03,871
It's them.

1002
01:25:04,872 --> 01:25:05,973
They must've followed me.

1003
01:25:07,875 --> 01:25:09,076
Yeah.

1004
01:25:09,110 --> 01:25:10,477
Oh, Willy!

1005
01:25:10,510 --> 01:25:12,479
Looks like they brought company, bro.

1006
01:25:13,881 --> 01:25:14,881
Fucking hell.

1007
01:25:16,817 --> 01:25:21,454
You're the next contestant on "It's Time to Fucking Die!"

1008
01:25:25,192 --> 01:25:25,993
You ready?

1009
01:25:26,027 --> 01:25:26,827
Yep.

1010
01:25:26,861 --> 01:25:27,828
All right, here we go.

1011
01:25:34,969 --> 01:25:36,137
Oh, shit!

1012
01:25:40,808 --> 01:25:41,474
Move out!

1013
01:25:51,152 --> 01:25:52,619
Damn it.

1014
01:25:52,652 --> 01:25:53,553
Move out!

1015
01:25:54,221 --> 01:25:56,023
Shit, fuck!

1016
01:25:56,057 --> 01:25:56,857
Go.

1017
01:26:04,065 --> 01:26:05,532
Stay down, stay down!

1018
01:26:17,178 --> 01:26:18,012
Come on!

1019
01:26:27,922 --> 01:26:28,823
Shit!

1020
01:26:45,239 --> 01:26:46,706
Fucking hell, man.

1021
01:26:57,318 --> 01:26:59,220
Fuck, go, go, go, go!

1022
01:27:00,587 --> 01:27:01,822
Go, go, go!

1023
01:27:04,291 --> 01:27:06,827
Better not try to shoot out my tires or some shit.

1024
01:27:06,861 --> 01:27:08,195
You know how much tires are, man?

1025
01:27:11,232 --> 01:27:13,067
Come on, Willy, come on, Willy!

1026
01:27:13,100 --> 01:27:14,144
They're fucking expensive,

1027
01:27:14,168 --> 01:27:17,071
and I know they're 800-fucking-dollars per tire!

1028
01:27:17,104 --> 01:27:20,207
Let's go, let's fucking do it, let's go!

1029
01:27:22,877 --> 01:27:25,112
I should've fucking seen her.

1030
01:27:27,848 --> 01:27:29,749
Fuck you, you're right on him, bro.

1031
01:27:29,783 --> 01:27:30,784
Come on.

1032
01:27:30,818 --> 01:27:31,718
Fuck!

1033
01:27:31,751 --> 01:27:32,796
Come on, get close,

1034
01:27:32,820 --> 01:27:33,964
get close, get close, get close!

1035
01:27:34,822 --> 01:27:35,789
Go!

1036
01:27:47,234 --> 01:27:48,601
Fucking hell, man.

1037
01:27:51,305 --> 01:27:53,040
Go, fuck this bitch!

1038
01:27:53,074 --> 01:27:54,707
Fuck, get those motherfuckers!

1039
01:28:02,383 --> 01:28:04,819
Come on, man, pick up, pick up, pick up.

1040
01:28:04,852 --> 01:28:06,921
Yo, what's up, what's good, my dude?

1041
01:28:06,954 --> 01:28:08,823
Roach, man, I need your help!

1042
01:28:09,689 --> 01:28:10,623
Get those motherfuckers!

1043
01:28:10,657 --> 01:28:12,135
Yo, man, you bringing me some noise, man?

1044
01:28:12,159 --> 01:28:13,793
Got no choice, man!

1045
01:28:13,828 --> 01:28:14,794
They trying to kill my ass!

1046
01:28:14,829 --> 01:28:15,996
Now, here?

1047
01:28:16,030 --> 01:28:16,831
Really, man?

1048
01:28:16,864 --> 01:28:19,233
I'm coming in hot, bro.

1049
01:28:19,266 --> 01:28:21,801
I got you, don't worry about it.

1050
01:28:22,802 --> 01:28:23,636
What the fuck is up?

1051
01:28:23,670 --> 01:28:24,839
That's an old friend.

1052
01:28:24,872 --> 01:28:26,807
He's gonna take care of us.

1053
01:28:26,841 --> 01:28:27,842
If we can get there.

1054
01:28:29,210 --> 01:28:31,812
Listen up, everyone, incoming.

1055
01:28:31,846 --> 01:28:32,745
Load up.

1056
01:28:32,779 --> 01:28:34,681
In a few hot seconds, some real bad guys

1057
01:28:34,714 --> 01:28:35,682
are gonna come up here, so keep

1058
01:28:35,715 --> 01:28:38,819
your fucking head on a swivel, and stay frosty

1059
01:28:38,853 --> 01:28:41,255
'cause a bunch of shit is about to pop the fuck off.

1060
01:29:00,975 --> 01:29:02,810
Woo, come on!

1061
01:29:05,045 --> 01:29:07,982
Fucking A, man, we're doing it!

1062
01:29:08,015 --> 01:29:08,781
Did we lose them?

1063
01:29:08,816 --> 01:29:11,152
Oh, fuck me, shit, my ass, damn it!

1064
01:29:18,859 --> 01:29:20,103
Come on, come on!

1065
01:29:27,767 --> 01:29:28,903
Back up, back up!

1066
01:29:37,011 --> 01:29:41,015
Woo, my man, you saved my ass, man.

1067
01:29:41,048 --> 01:29:42,816
You're my best parts supplier.

1068
01:29:42,850 --> 01:29:43,994
You know I'm not gonna let you die, brother.

1069
01:29:44,018 --> 01:29:46,153
Fucking A, bro, thank you.

1070
01:29:46,187 --> 01:29:47,421
Who the fuck is he?

1071
01:29:47,454 --> 01:29:49,823
Man, that's the guy they're after.

1072
01:29:49,857 --> 01:29:51,192
What the fuck did you do?

1073
01:29:52,326 --> 01:29:53,326
It's a long story.

1074
01:29:54,361 --> 01:29:55,829
Man, you that crazy motherfucker

1075
01:29:55,863 --> 01:29:58,232
that's killing all these fucks on TV, man.

1076
01:29:58,265 --> 01:29:59,732
I don't watch the news.

1077
01:29:59,766 --> 01:30:00,911
Well, I'm crazy, and you better be happy

1078
01:30:00,935 --> 01:30:02,102
that I am.

1079
01:30:09,109 --> 01:30:10,344
Get back, get back!

1080
01:30:24,692 --> 01:30:26,227
Going to hell in smoke, motherfucker.

1081
01:30:26,260 --> 01:30:27,760
Say hello to God.

1082
01:30:29,897 --> 01:30:30,831
Got ya.

1083
01:30:35,869 --> 01:30:36,869
I'm out!

1084
01:30:39,139 --> 01:30:40,441
I got you!

1085
01:30:41,976 --> 01:30:42,643
Go!

1086
01:31:09,436 --> 01:31:11,472
Help, please.

1087
01:31:19,079 --> 01:31:20,079
Willy.

1088
01:31:23,350 --> 01:31:24,885
Willy!

1089
01:31:27,054 --> 01:31:28,322
Oh, William!

1090
01:31:31,392 --> 01:31:32,392
Willy!

1091
01:31:35,629 --> 01:31:37,464
How many people have to die, Will?

1092
01:31:42,870 --> 01:31:45,839
You killed my father, Willy,

1093
01:31:45,873 --> 01:31:49,009
which I don't really blame you.

1094
01:31:53,080 --> 01:31:54,315
But Danny...

1095
01:31:57,885 --> 01:31:59,853
Danny I didn't want to die.

1096
01:32:03,257 --> 01:32:04,925
I fucking loved him.

1097
01:32:06,927 --> 01:32:11,098
He wasn't made for this world like you and I.

1098
01:32:11,131 --> 01:32:12,131
No, no.

1099
01:32:14,435 --> 01:32:17,137
No, you have to stop.

1100
01:32:19,406 --> 01:32:22,009
It's over now.

1101
01:32:22,042 --> 01:32:23,042
It's over, Willy.

1102
01:32:23,677 --> 01:32:27,881
I told you I would get you,

1103
01:32:30,517 --> 01:32:31,652
and I got you.

1104
01:32:35,322 --> 01:32:36,657
And I got you.

1105
01:33:15,696 --> 01:33:17,431
Got you.

1106
01:33:55,369 --> 01:33:57,137
All right, everybody move!

1107
01:33:57,171 --> 01:33:58,472
You two go around back!

1108
01:34:02,609 --> 01:34:03,610
Go!
- Go!

1109
01:34:10,617 --> 01:34:11,518
Hey, hurry up.

1110
01:34:22,029 --> 01:34:23,697
Welcome to the party, fellas.

1111
01:34:29,703 --> 01:34:30,703
Got your guy.

1112
01:34:33,707 --> 01:34:34,708
Yeah.

1113
01:34:36,109 --> 01:34:37,711
Wanna go get a drink?

1114
01:34:40,747 --> 01:34:42,683
Can't have you die on me.

1115
01:34:42,716 --> 01:34:44,151
You caused a lot of damage.

1116
01:34:49,723 --> 01:34:54,728
You better arrest me.

1117
01:35:05,506 --> 01:35:07,274
I hope it was worth it.
