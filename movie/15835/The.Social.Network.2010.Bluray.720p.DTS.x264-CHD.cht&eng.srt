2
00:00:16,603 --> 00:00:18,933
你知不知道 中國的天才
You know there are more people with genius IQ living in China

3
00:00:18,933 --> 00:00:20,996
比美國人口還要多
than they're people of any kind living in United States.

4
00:00:20,996 --> 00:00:22,815
- 這不可能 - 真的
- That can't be possible be true. - That is.

5
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:23,735
為什麼呢？
What would account for that?

6
00:00:23,735 --> 00:00:25,272
首先 中國的人口多
First, awful lot people living in China.

7
00:00:25,272 --> 00:00:27,032
但我的問題是
But, here's my question.

8
00:00:27,203 --> 00:00:31,285
在那些SAT考滿分的人中 你如何讓自己與別不同呢？
How do you distinguish yourself than population of people who all got 1600 under SAT's?

9
00:00:31,285 --> 00:00:33,081
- 中國不考SAT吧 - 沒錯
- I didn't know they take SAT's in China. - They don't.

10
00:00:33,081 --> 00:00:35,203
但我說的不是中國 是我自己
I wasn't talkin' about China anymore. I was talkin' about me.

11
00:00:35,203 --> 00:00:36,782
- 你考了滿分？ - 對
- You got 1600? - Yes.

12
00:00:36,782 --> 00:00:38,944
我本可以去合唱團的 但我不會唱歌
I can sing in a Capella group, but I can't sing.

13
00:00:38,944 --> 00:00:40,331
也就是你SAT一道題都沒錯
Does that mean you actually got nothing wrong?

14
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:42,159
我可以劃賽艇 也可以發明25美元的電腦
I could row crew or invent a 25 dollar PC.

15
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:43,894
或者加入終極俱樂部？
Or you get into the "Final Club"?

16
00:00:43,894 --> 00:00:45,425
對 也可以加入終極俱樂部
Or I get into the "Final Club".

17
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:48,761
從女人的角度來看 男人不加入是件好事
You know, from women perspective sometimes, not seeing a man in is a good thing.

18
00:00:48,761 --> 00:00:50,915
- 我沒開玩笑 - 不過我還挺喜歡男生劃賽艇的
- This is serious. - On the other hand, I do like a row crew.

19
00:00:51,448 --> 00:00:53,304
呃 那玩意我弄不來
Well, I can't do that.

20
00:00:53,304 --> 00:00:55,948
- 我開玩笑的 - 我SAT一道題都沒錯
- I was kidding. - Yes, I got nothing wrong in test.

21
00:00:56,132 --> 00:00:57,108
那你有試過嗎？
Have you ever tried?

22
00:00:57,108 --> 00:00:58,835
- 我正嘗試著呢 - 嘗試加入賽艇隊？
- I'm trying right now. - To row crew?

23
00:00:58,835 --> 00:01:02,479
是終極俱樂部 怎麼會是賽艇隊 才不 你是不是誤會了
Gettin' into "Final Club". To row crew? No! Are you like... whatever, delusional?

24
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,350
可能吧 有時候你兩件事一塊說
Maybe, sometimes you said 2 things at once,

25
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:05,877
我就抓不住你的重點了…
I'm not sure which one I suppose to be aiming at...

26
00:01:05,877 --> 00:01:08,343
不過你見過劃賽艇的人 對吧
But you seen guys who row crew, right?

27
00:01:08,606 --> 00:01:10,153
- 沒啊 - 好吧 他們比我壯
- No. - Ok, well, they bigger than me.

28
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,173
都是世界級的運動員
They world class athlete.

29
00:01:11,173 --> 00:01:12,935
你剛剛還說喜歡劃賽艇的
Like a second ago you said you like guys who row crew.

30
00:01:12,935 --> 00:01:13,855
所以我想你該見過
So I assumed you've met one.

31
00:01:13,855 --> 00:01:17,916
我就是那意思 就像女孩都喜歡牛仔一樣
I guess, I just meant like the idea of it, you know the way a girl likes cowboys.

32
00:01:18,642 --> 00:01:19,618
好吧
Ok.

33
00:01:20,156 --> 00:01:20,933
我們是不是應該點些吃的
Should we get something to eat?

34
00:01:20,933 --> 00:01:23,043
你想不想談點別的
Would you like to talk about something else?

35
00:01:23,043 --> 00:01:26,808
不 只是從討論終極俱樂部開始
No, it just that since the beginning of the conversation about the "Finals Club"

36
00:01:26,808 --> 00:01:28,543
我就覺得時間過得很快
I think I may have miss a birthday.

37
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:32,388
中國天才真的比美國的總人口…
There are really more people in China with genius IQ's than entire...

38
00:01:32,388 --> 00:01:35,775
鳳凰俱樂部最多元化 還有福萊俱樂部 羅斯福加的是坡客
"Phoenix" is the most diverse. The "Fry Club", Roosevelt punched the porc.

39
00:01:35,775 --> 00:01:36,403
哪個羅斯福？
Which one?

40
00:01:36,403 --> 00:01:38,326
坡斯廉俱樂部 也叫坡客 是最頂尖的
"The Porcellian, the Porc, it's the best of the best"

41
00:01:38,326 --> 00:01:39,302
我是問哪個羅斯福？
Which Roosevelt?

42
00:01:39,302 --> 00:01:40,603
西奧多.羅斯福
Theodore

43
00:01:41,562 --> 00:01:43,835
是不是他們真用大巴去接…
Is it true they send a bus around to pick up the girls?

44
00:01:43,835 --> 00:01:45,587
想和下任鳳凰俱樂部主席開派對的姑娘啊
Who wanna party with next phoenix chairman.

45
00:01:45,587 --> 00:01:47,467
你懂為什麼我想去那了吧
So you can see why it's so important to get in.

46
00:01:47,467 --> 00:01:49,953
好吧 哪個是最容易加的
Well, which is the easiest to get into?

47
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:53,447
你為什麼問我這個
Why would you ask me that?

48
00:01:53,701 --> 00:01:54,990
就隨便問問
I was just asking.

49
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,941
沒有容易的  這才是關鍵
None of them. That's the point.

50
00:01:57,346 --> 00:02:00,350
我朋友愛德華多 去年夏天 靠投機石油期貨賺了三十萬
My friend, Eduardo made $300.000 betting oil futures one summer.

51
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,817
可他想進去還差得遠呢
And Eduardo won't comes close to get in.

52
00:02:01,817 --> 00:02:03,978
這堛漱H根本不看重掙錢的能力
The ability to make money doesn't impress anybody around here.

53
00:02:03,978 --> 00:02:07,323
他一定很厲害 一夏天掙了三十萬啊
Must be nice. He made $300.000 in a summer.

54
00:02:07,523 --> 00:02:09,715
- 他喜歡氣象學 - 你剛才不是還說石油期貨嗎
- He likes meteorology. - You said it was oil futures.

55
00:02:09,715 --> 00:02:11,751
你要是能預知天氣 你就能預測燃油的價格
You can read the weather, you can predict the price of heating oil.

56
00:02:11,751 --> 00:02:15,273
你剛才那麼問我 是不是覺得 只有最容易進的終極俱樂部
I think you ask me that because you think the "Final Club" that's easiest to get into is the one,

57
00:02:15,273 --> 00:02:16,765
我才有希望啊
where I'll have the best chance...

58
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:18,290
什麼
What?

59
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,244
你問我哪個是最容易進的
You ask me which one is the easiest to get into

60
00:02:20,244 --> 00:02:22,839
因為你覺得我進那個的可能性最大
Because you think that the one, where I have the best chance.

61
00:02:22,839 --> 00:02:24,646
你容易進
The one that the easiest is to get into,

62
00:02:24,646 --> 00:02:26,893
別人也容易進啊
Would be the one where anybody has the best chance.

63
00:02:26,893 --> 00:02:28,379
你問的不是哪個是最好的
You didn't ask me which one was the best one.

64
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:30,005
你問我哪個是最容易進的
You ask me which one was the easiest one.

65
00:02:30,005 --> 00:02:31,698
我就那麼一問 好吧
I was honestly just asking, ok...

66
00:02:31,698 --> 00:02:33,402
就那麼一問…
I was just asking to ask...

67
00:02:33,402 --> 00:02:36,196
- 馬克 我沒別的意思 - 艾瑞卡
- Mark, I'm not speaking in code. - Erika,

68
00:02:36,386 --> 00:02:38,522
你已經沉迷在終極俱樂部了
You obsesses with "Finals Clubs"

69
00:02:38,522 --> 00:02:40,924
你得了終極俱樂部強迫癥 你得找個醫生看看
You have "Finals Clubs" - OCD  You need to see someone about it.

70
00:02:40,924 --> 00:02:42,803
讓他給你開點藥
who'll prescribe you some sort of medication

71
00:02:42,803 --> 00:02:45,076
反正你也不在乎副作用會不會讓你失明
You don't care if the side effect may include blindness.

72
00:02:45,076 --> 00:02:48,311
是終極俱樂部 不是決賽俱樂部
"Final Clubs" not "Finals Clubs"

73
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:51,725
而且沉湎其中和積極進取是不一樣的
And there's a difference between being obsessed than being motivated.

74
00:02:51,725 --> 00:02:54,505
沒錯 是不一樣
Yes, there is.

75
00:02:54,505 --> 00:02:56,765
你就是這樣 你剛剛就是話埵雩
Well, you do that, it's was cryptic, so you do speaking code.

76
00:02:56,765 --> 00:02:57,661
我沒想說別的
I didn't mean to be cryptic.

77
00:02:57,661 --> 00:03:01,542
我所要說的就是我需要做點大事 好讓他們注意到我
I'm just saying I need to do something substantial in order to get the attention of the club.

78
00:03:01,542 --> 00:03:02,156
為什麼
Why?

79
00:03:02,156 --> 00:03:04,635
因為那地方獨一無二 樂趣橫生
Because they're exclusive and fun.

80
00:03:04,635 --> 00:03:05,771
而且能讓我過的更好
And they lead to the better life.

81
00:03:05,771 --> 00:03:07,758
泰迪羅斯福選上美國總統
Teddy Roosevelt didn't get elected for the president

82
00:03:07,758 --> 00:03:11,803
- 也不是因為他是鳳凰俱樂部的啊 - 就是這個原因 還有 他是坡斯廉的
- because he was member from "Phoenix" Club? - He was a member of The Porcellian, and yes he did.

83
00:03:11,896 --> 00:03:15,969
你怎麼不集中精力做你最好的自己呢
Why don't you just concentrate on being the best you, you can be.

84
00:03:16,053 --> 00:03:16,887
你真這麼覺得
Did you really just said that?

85
00:03:16,887 --> 00:03:18,089
開玩笑的
I was kidding.

86
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:21,319
- 我就是陳述事實 一點也不過分 - 我就和你直說吧
- *** - I wanna try to be straight forward

87
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:24,045
我覺得你應該支持我
*** You might wanna be a little more supportive.

88
00:03:24,111 --> 00:03:26,680
如果我進了俱樂部 我就能帶你去參加各種聚會活動
If I get in I will be taking you to the events

89
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,974
還可以介紹很多你平時見不到的人物認識
and the gatherings and will be meeting a lot of people you won't normally get to meet.

90
00:03:31,851 --> 00:03:33,703
你真打算這樣嗎
You would do that for me?

91
00:03:33,884 --> 00:03:34,654
你是我女朋友啊
We're dating.

92
00:03:35,693 --> 00:03:36,822
好吧 
Ok,

93
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:42,007
那我也和你直說吧 咱倆完了
well I wanna try and be straight forward even let you know that we're not anymore.

94
00:03:42,007 --> 00:03:43,017
你什麼意思
What you mean?

95
00:03:43,017 --> 00:03:44,563
我們不再是男女朋友了 對不起
We're not dating anymore. I'm sorry.

96
00:03:44,563 --> 00:03:46,817
- 開玩笑的吧 - 我認真的
- This is a joke? - No, it's not.

97
00:03:46,817 --> 00:03:47,663
你要跟我分手
You're breaking up with me?

98
00:03:47,663 --> 00:03:51,018
你要介紹我認識一些我平時見不到的人物
You gonna introduce me the people I wouldn't normally have the chance to meet.

99
00:03:51,018 --> 00:03:51,687
這他媽…
What the f...

100
00:03:51,687 --> 00:03:53,443
- 這到底什麼意思啊？ - 淡定點
- What is that supposed to mean? - Wait, settle down.

101
00:03:53,443 --> 00:03:54,384
我什麼意思？
What is it supposed to mean?

102
00:03:54,384 --> 00:03:56,043
艾瑞卡 我們之所以坐在這喝一杯
Erica, the reason we're able to sit and drink right now,

103
00:03:56,043 --> 00:03:57,613
是因為你過去和看門那傢伙上過床
because you used to sleep with the door guy.

104
00:03:59,256 --> 00:04:00,943
他叫鮑比
"The door guy" his name is Bobby.

105
00:04:00,943 --> 00:04:02,721
我沒跟他上過床
I have not slept with "the door guy".

106
00:04:02,721 --> 00:04:04,181
他是我的一個朋友
"The door guy" is a friend of mine.

107
00:04:04,181 --> 00:04:06,542
而且他是個好人
And he's the perfectly good class of people.

108
00:04:07,402 --> 00:04:10,087
你就出身名門嗎？
And what part of Long Island you from? Wimbledon?

109
00:04:10,087 --> 00:04:12,825
- 別別 你真生氣了 - 我回去了
- Wait,Wait, wait is this real? - I'm going back to my dormy.

110
00:04:12,825 --> 00:04:14,979
- 是的 - 那好吧 我道歉還不行
- Yes. - Ok, than wait, I apologize, ok...

111
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:15,915
- 我要去看書了 - 艾瑞卡…
- I have to go study. - Erika...

112
00:04:15,915 --> 00:04:18,084
- 怎麼 - 我真心的道歉
- Yes? - I'm sorry, I meant it.

113
00:04:18,084 --> 00:04:19,571
我很滿意 但我真得回去學習了
I appreciate that but I have to go study.

114
00:04:19,571 --> 00:04:20,399
別這樣 你回去也不學習  
Come on. You don't have to study.

115
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,784
何必回去呢 我們談談吧
You don't have to study. Let just talk.

116
00:04:21,784 --> 00:04:22,870
- 不行 - 為什麼
- I can't - Why?

117
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,923
因為我累了 跟你約會 就像和跑步機約會一樣
Because it is exhausting. Dating you is like dating a stairmaster.

118
00:04:25,923 --> 00:04:27,275
我就是說 你現在用不著…
All I meant is that you not likely to...

119
00:04:27,812 --> 00:04:29,676
我不是說你爸媽
Currently, I wasn't making a comment on you're parents.

120
00:04:29,676 --> 00:04:30,764
我就是說你去的是波士頓大學
I was saying that you go to B.U. *Boston University*

121
00:04:30,764 --> 00:04:31,741
我就是陳述事實 就這樣  
I was studying a fact. That's all.

122
00:04:31,741 --> 00:04:32,953
如果你認為我太粗魯 我還是會道歉的
If it's seem rude, than of course I've to apologize.

123
00:04:32,953 --> 00:04:34,523
- 我要去看書了 - 你不用看的
- I have to go study. - You don't have to study.

124
00:04:34,523 --> 00:04:37,230
- 你為什麼總說我不用學習啊 - 因為你就念個波士頓大學而已
- Why you keep saying that I don't need to study. - Because you go to B.U.

125
00:04:39,719 --> 00:04:40,991
想吃點什麼嗎
Wanna get some food?

126
00:04:42,035 --> 00:04:45,087
非常抱歉我的教育程度沒能讓您滿意
I'm sorry you're not sufficiently impressed with my educations.

127
00:04:45,087 --> 00:04:46,529
我也很抱歉 因為我沒有賽艇
I'm sorry, I don't have a row boat.

128
00:04:46,529 --> 00:04:48,490
- 那我們扯平了 - 我想我們還是做朋友吧
- So we're even. - I think we should just be friend.

129
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:49,778
我不缺朋友
I don't want friends.

130
00:04:49,973 --> 00:04:52,472
我也就是客氣下 我一點也不想和你做朋友
I was just being polite. I have no intention of being friends with you...

131
00:04:52,472 --> 00:04:54,391
操作系統課讓我壓力很大
I'm under some pressure right now from my OS class.

132
00:04:54,391 --> 00:04:56,083
點些吃的吧 或許我們就能…
If could just order some food. I think we should...

133
00:04:57,131 --> 00:05:00,996
或許你以後在電腦行業會大有作為
Look, you will probably going to be very successful computer person.

134
00:05:02,422 --> 00:05:04,641
你一輩子都會覺得
You gonna go thru life thinking that girls don't like you,

135
00:05:04,641 --> 00:05:06,525
女孩子不喜歡你是因為你是書獃子
Because you're a nerd...

136
00:05:07,202 --> 00:05:10,546
但我真心的說 你錯了
I want you know, from the bottom of my heart that won't be true.

137
00:05:11,922 --> 00:05:14,742
那是因為你是個混蛋
It would be because you are an asshole.

138
00:05:26,053 --> 00:05:28,739

社交網絡
The Social Network

141
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:45,477
哈佛大學 秋天 2003年
Harvard University, Fall 2003

142
00:07:49,234 --> 00:07:50,815
科克蘭公寓
Kirkland House

143
00:08:09,653 --> 00:08:11,627
晚上8點13分
8:13 PM

144
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,618
艾瑞卡·奧布萊特就是個賤貨
Erika Albright's a bitch

145
00:08:18,618 --> 00:08:21,221
你這麼說 是因為她家之前姓奧布萊希特
You think that's because her family changed their name from Albrecht?

146
00:08:21,221 --> 00:08:23,873
還是你覺得所有波士頓大學的女生都是婊子呢
Or do you think because all B.U. girls are bitches?

147
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,918
鄭重聲明 她也許看著有34C
For the record, she may look like a 34C.

148
00:08:30,918 --> 00:08:33,604
但那全是豐胸內衣的功勞
but she's getting all kind of help from our friends at "Victoria's Secret"

149
00:08:33,604 --> 00:08:36,420
她只有34B 而且堶探N像飛機場一樣
She's a 34B, as in barely anything there.

150
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,017
虛假廣告害死人
False Advertising.

151
00:08:39,714 --> 00:08:41,597
晚上 9點48分
9:48 PM

152
00:08:41,818 --> 00:08:43,694
事實上她臉蛋還不錯
The truth is she has a nice face.

153
00:08:43,694 --> 00:08:45,763
我得幹點什麼轉移注意力
I need to do something to take my mind of her.

154
00:08:45,763 --> 00:08:47,915
說著容易 但我得先有個辦法
Easy enough, except I need an idea.

155
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:56,983
我有點喝醉了 我不會撒謊的
I'm a little intoxicated. I'm not gonna lie.

156
00:08:56,983 --> 00:08:59,511
就算是無聊的週二 還沒到十點 又有什麼關係呢
So, what if it's not even 10pm and it's a Tuesday night?

157
00:09:00,168 --> 00:09:01,864
科克蘭的Facebook開在我桌面上
The Kirkland's facebook is open on my desktop

158
00:09:01,864 --> 00:09:04,289
有人上傳了不少雷人的照片
And somebody of these people with pretty horrendous facebook pics.

159
00:09:05,588 --> 00:09:07,286
坐在那的比利·奧羅森出了個主意
Billy Olsen's sitting here had the idea,

160
00:09:07,286 --> 00:09:09,306
說把這些照片和家禽家畜放在一起
putting some of the picture next to picture of farm animal,

161
00:09:09,306 --> 00:09:11,351
然後讓大家投票看哪個更火
and have people vote who's hotter.

162
00:09:11,795 --> 00:09:13,335
這主意不錯啊 奧羅森先生
Good call, Mr. Olsen!

163
00:09:20,038 --> 00:09:21,603
好的 開始
Yeah, it's on.

164
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:24,565
我不想和家禽家畜比 但我覺得拿兩個人比不錯
I'm not gonna do the farm animal but I like the idea of comparing two people together.

165
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:28,334
因為這比Hotornot.com上 給性感程度直接打分的方式更含蓄
It gives the whole thing a very "Turing" feel since people's rating of the picture is more implicit...

166
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:32,391
給人一種"圖靈機"的感覺 (存儲量沒有限制的理論計算機)
Than say, choosing a number to represent each person's hotness like they do on hotornot. com

167
00:09:32,857 --> 00:09:34,910
首先我們需要許多照片
The first thing we're going to need is a lot of picture

168
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,411
不幸的是哈佛沒有統一公開的照片庫
Unfortunately, Harvard doesn't keep a public centralized facebook,

169
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:40,415
所以我將從各自宿舍電腦盜取他們照片
So I'm going to get all the images from the individual houses that people are in,

170
00:09:42,158 --> 00:09:43,626
黑客登場
Let the hacking begin!

171
00:09:59,337 --> 00:10:03,555
從科克蘭開始 這堛漱@切都是公開的 還允許在Apache系統中奡﹞J目錄
First up is Kirkland, they keep everything open and allow indexes in their Apache configuration,

172
00:10:03,555 --> 00:10:08,031
所以用個WGET就能下載 科克蘭全部的照片庫圖片了
So a little wget magic is all that's necessary to download the entire Kirkland facebook.

173
00:10:08,031 --> 00:10:09,157
易如反掌
Kid's stuff.

174
00:10:26,688 --> 00:10:29,844
下來是伊利爾特 他們也是公開的 但在Apache上加不了目錄
Next is Eliot. They're also open, but with no indexes in Apache.

175
00:10:29,844 --> 00:10:33,456
我進行一個空白搜索 接著數據庫堛漫狾章洃驦N會顯示出來
I can run an empty search and it returns all of the images in the database in a single page.

176
00:10:33,456 --> 00:10:36,712
然後我保存網頁 火狐就會幫我存好照片
Then I can save the page and Mozilla will save all the images for me.

177
00:10:36,915 --> 00:10:39,098
不錯 進展順利
Excellent. Moving right along.

178
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:41,165
請注意
Excuse me, everybody...

179
00:10:41,165 --> 00:10:47,729
你們現在所在的是 全世界最古老最有特色俱樂部
You're in one of the oldest, one of the most exclusive club, not just Harvard but in the world.

180
00:10:47,729 --> 00:10:52,302
現在我宣佈鳳凰俱樂部秋季學期首場派對開始
Now, I wanna welcome you all, The Phoenix Club First Party of the fall semester.

181
00:10:59,548 --> 00:11:02,453
洛厄爾有安全防護 需要用戶名和密碼
Lowell has some security they require username/password combo.

182
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:05,423
我可以直接進入 而且說他們沒有FAS用戶權限
I'm gonna go ahead and says the don't have an access to main fas user database

183
00:11:05,423 --> 00:11:07,425
所以他們看不到這次入侵
So they have no worry detecting an intrusion.

184
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:11,670
亞當斯沒有安全系統 且每頁只能顯示20個結果
Adams has no security but limit the number of result to 20 of pages,

185
00:11:11,818 --> 00:11:15,206
我再用一次對付洛厄爾的辦法就能搞定
All I need to do is to break up some script I use on Lowell and reset.

186
00:11:16,369 --> 00:11:18,737
昆西都沒有在線的Facebook 真寒磣
Quincy has no online facebook, what a shame!

187
00:11:18,801 --> 00:11:20,537
這我也沒辦法
Nothing I can do about that.

188
00:11:21,239 --> 00:11:25,184
頓斯特不太好弄 他們不是沒公共目錄 他們壓根就沒目錄
Dunster is intense not only there's no public directory but there's no directory at all.

189
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:28,892
你必須進行搜索 而且每次超過二十個結果 就什麼都不會顯示
You have to do searches. And if you're search return more than 20 matches, nothing's get return.

190
00:11:28,892 --> 00:11:31,301
一旦有個結果 也不會直接連接到圖片
Once you do get result, they don't link directly to images.

191
00:11:31,301 --> 00:11:33,353
而是連接到個人網頁或別的什麼
They link to PHP that redirect to something.

192
00:11:33,353 --> 00:11:35,525
很奇怪 估計不太容易 我一會再弄
Weird! That's maybe difficult, I'll come back later.

193
00:11:35,525 --> 00:11:37,277
- 馬克 謝爾頓醒了 - 怎麼了
- Hei, Mark! - What?

194
00:11:38,056 --> 00:11:39,982
- 做的好 魚很不錯 - 謝了
- Great one. Beautiful fish. - Thanks.

195
00:11:39,982 --> 00:11:41,995
埃弗雷特稍好點 雖然還是要搜索
Leverett is a little better. They still make you search.

196
00:11:41,995 --> 00:11:45,259
空白搜索會鏈接到有每個學生照片的網頁上
But you can do an empty search and get links to pages with every students pictures

197
00:11:45,259 --> 00:11:47,772
噁心的是 每次只能打開一張
I slightly obnoxious that they only let you view one picture at a time...

198
00:11:47,772 --> 00:11:50,833
我不可能打開五百個網頁 下載一百次照片
There's no way I'm gonna go to 500 pages to download pics one at a time

199
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:54,095
所以有必要退出EMACS 修改Perl代碼
So it's definitely necessary to break out emacs and modify that Perl script.

200
00:12:00,455 --> 00:12:02,410
凌晨 2點08分
***

201
00:12:11,437 --> 00:12:12,344
搞定
Done.

202
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:14,271
怎樣了
Hey, what's goin' on?

203
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:15,741
時機正好 愛德華多來了
Perfect timing.

204
00:12:15,741 --> 00:12:18,776
他有我最需要的東西
Eduardo is here and he is going to have the key ingredients

205
00:12:18,776 --> 00:12:20,165
- 馬克 - 愛德華多…
- Hey Mark, - Eduardo...

206
00:12:20,165 --> 00:12:21,927
你和艾瑞卡分手了？
You and Erica split up?

207
00:12:22,768 --> 00:12:23,657
你怎麼知道的
How did you know that?

208
00:12:23,657 --> 00:12:25,458
你博客上都寫著呢
It's on your blog.

209
00:12:25,986 --> 00:12:27,802
- 好吧 - 你還好吧
- Yeah. - Are you alright?

210
00:12:27,802 --> 00:12:29,855
- 我要你幫忙 - 我就是幹這個來的
- I need you. - I'm here for you.

211
00:12:30,192 --> 00:12:32,304
不是要你安慰我 我需要你投機石油時用的公式
No, I need the algorithm you use to rank chess players.

212
00:12:32,304 --> 00:12:33,371
你沒事兒吧
Are you ok?

213
00:12:33,568 --> 00:12:34,965
我們在給女孩打分
We're ranking girls.

214
00:12:36,988 --> 00:12:39,110
- 你說女學生嗎 - 對
- You mean others student. -Yup.

215
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,787
你覺得這是個好主意嗎
You think this such a good idea?

216
00:12:40,864 --> 00:12:43,774
我需要那個運算公式
I need the algorithm, alright. I need the algorithm.

217
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:47,726
每個女生有1400的基礎分
Each girl base rating 1400.

218
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:52,232
在某一時刻女孩A得到R-a的評分 女孩B得到R-b的評分
At any given time "Girl A" has a rating R-a and "Girl B" has a rating R-b.

219
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:53,742
當對任意兩個女孩進行評比時
When any 2 girls are matched up,

220
00:12:53,742 --> 00:12:56,563
會根據已有的分數進行的評測
there's an expectation of which will win based on their current rating, right?

221
00:12:56,563 --> 00:12:59,986
沒錯 這些評測方法寫出來就是這樣
yeah.And all those expectations are express this way.

222
00:13:00,342 --> 00:13:01,299
把這些寫成程序吧
Let's write it.

223
00:13:16,703 --> 00:13:17,967
左邊的
The one on the left.

224
00:13:18,689 --> 00:13:19,827
右邊的
The right.

225
00:13:20,134 --> 00:13:21,702
右邊的
***

226
00:13:21,702 --> 00:13:23,354
- 搞定了 - 我們該先傳給誰呢
- It works. - Who should we send it first?

227
00:13:23,354 --> 00:13:24,805
- 德懷恩 - 尼爾
- Dwyer - Neal

228
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:26,156
你想傳給誰
Who will you send it to?

229
00:13:26,156 --> 00:13:27,792
唉 就那麼幾個人唄
Just to couple of people.

230
00:13:27,792 --> 00:13:31,270
問題是 他們會傳給誰
Question is: who are they gonna send it to?

231
00:14:00,721 --> 00:14:02,225
哥幾個 快過來看看
Hey, guys check this out.

232
00:14:04,528 --> 00:14:06,314
這倆姑娘 左邊還是右邊
Right or left.

233
00:14:06,314 --> 00:14:07,526
左邊那個
***

234
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:08,810
右邊還是左邊
Right or left.

235
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:11,098
左邊那個
*****

236
00:14:12,533 --> 00:14:13,621
右邊還是左邊
Right or left.

237
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:15,606
那是我室友
She's my room mate.

238
00:14:19,751 --> 00:14:21,178
悲劇啊
This is pathetic.

239
00:14:21,178 --> 00:14:23,071
奧爾布賴特
Albright?

240
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:32,181
他寫了和你有關的博客
He blog about you.

241
00:14:32,686 --> 00:14:34,533
你一定不想看到的
You don't wanna read it.

242
00:14:38,475 --> 00:14:39,598
左邊的
***

243
00:14:40,235 --> 00:14:41,095
還真是
*********

244
00:14:41,095 --> 00:14:46,495
艾瑞卡 這是你的內衣嗎？ 我們從新生那堸膘茠
Erika, is this yours? ***

245
00:14:46,495 --> 00:14:48,212
給我滾出去
***

246
00:14:59,618 --> 00:15:01,559
流量真大啊
Awful lot of traffic.

247
00:15:02,923 --> 00:15:06,156
你說我們是不是在它出事前收手啊
You think maybe we should shut it down before get into trouble.

248
00:15:15,144 --> 00:15:15,982
喂
Hello?

249
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,953
慢點說 什麼事
Wa-wait... what?

250
00:15:21,704 --> 00:15:22,735
在凌晨四點？
At 4 in the morning?

251
00:15:22,735 --> 00:15:25,738
有個流量異常網站
Well, this very an usual amount of traffic to the switch of Kirkland.

252
00:15:25,738 --> 00:15:28,282
不正常是說凌晨四點不該有那個流量嗎
You're saying it's unusual for 4 in the morning?

253
00:15:28,282 --> 00:15:31,294
不 就算是在超級碗比賽中場休息時 這個流量也不正常
No, this should be unusual for half time at the superbowl.

254
00:15:32,105 --> 00:15:33,239
好吧
Alright.

255
00:15:36,524 --> 00:15:37,518
我有點急事
I'm gonna go in.

256
00:15:38,423 --> 00:15:39,836
怎麼了？
What's goin' on?

257
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:42,614
哈佛的網絡要癱瘓了
Harvard network is about to crash.

258
00:15:49,018 --> 00:15:50,362
你說不會是…
You don't think...

259
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:52,998
沒錯
I do...

260
00:15:54,055 --> 00:15:55,509
看看別人的吧
Go to see if it's everybody...

261
00:16:01,871 --> 00:16:02,935
都連不上
I can't comin'

262
00:16:04,415 --> 00:16:05,729
網絡癱瘓了
The network's down.

263
00:16:06,453 --> 00:16:08,758
如果不是巧合 我覺得這就是我們幹的
Unless, it's coincidence, I think this is us.

264
00:16:08,758 --> 00:16:10,478
這不是巧合
It's not a coincidence.

265
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:12,713
媽的
Holy shit...

266
00:16:16,567 --> 00:16:18,126
你就這樣被校委會叫去談話
So you were called in front of the Ad Board.

267
00:16:18,126 --> 00:16:19,286
不是那樣的
That's not what happen.

268
00:16:19,286 --> 00:16:21,481
你沒被校委會叫去啊
You weren't called in front of the Administrator Board?

269
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:24,742
我是說 在之前 我和艾瑞卡在酒吧那一晚
No, back, I mean... that's, back at the bar with Erica Albright.

270
00:16:24,742 --> 00:16:25,803
- 她那麼說嗎 - 馬克
- She said all that? - Mark.

271
00:16:25,803 --> 00:16:27,113
我跟她說了那樣的話嗎
That I said that stuff to her.

272
00:16:27,113 --> 00:16:29,324
我就是在讀她的證詞啊
I was reading from the transcript for the deposition.

273
00:16:29,324 --> 00:16:30,717
你們究竟為什麼要她作證啊？
Why we do even need to depose her?

274
00:16:30,717 --> 00:16:32,384
這是我們的事
That really for us to decide.

275
00:16:32,384 --> 00:16:34,361
你覺得如果她把我說的像個混蛋
Miss, You think if I know she can make me look like a jerk.

276
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:35,821
- 我就會妥協的話 你錯了 - 馬克…
- I'll be more likely to settle. - Mark...

277
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:38,099
我們休息一下 可以嗎
Why don't we stretch our legs for a minute, can we do that?

278
00:16:38,099 --> 00:16:39,699
都連著3個小時了
It's been almost 3 hours.

279
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:41,826
老實說你浪費了那麼多時間
And frankly you did spend awful lot of the time...

280
00:16:41,826 --> 00:16:44,673
就想用一個女孩在酒吧的證詞 讓扎克伯格先生難堪嗎？
Embarrassing Mr. Zuckerberg with the girl's testimony from the bar.

281
00:16:44,673 --> 00:16:46,617
我沒覺得難堪 只是她說了很多假話
I'm not embarrassed. She just made a lot that up.

282
00:16:46,617 --> 00:16:47,678
她發過誓的
She was under oath.

283
00:16:47,678 --> 00:16:50,373
我猜她不是第一個發了誓以後做偽證的吧
I guess there would be the first time somebody's lies under oath.

284
00:17:01,381 --> 00:17:04,295
兩個小時內點擊率就有兩千兩百多嗎
You got 22 hundred hits within 2 hours?

285
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:06,372
- 萬 - 什麼
- Thousands. - What?

286
00:17:07,922 --> 00:17:09,848
兩萬兩千次
Twenty-two *thousands*.

287
00:17:30,312 --> 00:17:32,388
他們真快啊
These guys are pretty fast.

288
00:17:37,937 --> 00:17:40,005
有人能讓這比賽公平點嗎？
Sure anybody make this a fair fight?

289
00:17:40,824 --> 00:17:42,276
咱們跳進水 游過去
Jump up and swim.

290
00:17:43,018 --> 00:17:44,954
跳進去我們就淹死了
I think we'd have to jump up and drowned.

291
00:17:45,378 --> 00:17:48,007
要不你向前劃 我向後
Or you could row forward, I could row backward.

292
00:17:48,481 --> 00:17:51,576
我們是雙胞胎  科學上來說我們應該一樣啊
We're genetically identical, science says we'd stay in the one place.

293
00:17:51,635 --> 00:17:53,270
老實划船吧
Just row the damn boat.

294
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:02,612
- 你聽說了嗎 - 什麼
- You guys here about this? - What?

295
00:18:02,841 --> 00:18:06,566
兩天前的晚上 一名科克蘭的大二學生 用他的筆記本電腦弄癱了網絡
Two nights ago, a sophomore shut network from laptop at Kirkland.

296
00:18:06,566 --> 00:18:08,577
- 真的 - 還是在凌晨四點
- *** - At 4AM.

297
00:18:08,577 --> 00:18:09,222
他怎麼做到的
How?

298
00:18:09,222 --> 00:18:12,632
他建了個評選最性感在校女生的網站
He set up a website, where you vote on the hotness female undergrads.

299
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,017
當時我們在幹嘛 怎麼沒聽說這事
What were we doing that none of us heard about this?

300
00:18:15,017 --> 00:18:17,931
忘了 好像是早飯前三個小時皮艇訓練
*** Three hours rows before breakfast.

301
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:22,011
然後就去看書學習了
For course... Studying. ***

302
00:18:22,012 --> 00:18:23,350
之後在泳池泡了三個小時 又繼續學習 也不知道怎麼就錯過了
***

303
00:18:23,842 --> 00:18:25,069
那網站受歡迎嗎？
How much activity was on those thing?

304
00:18:25,069 --> 00:18:27,673
兩萬兩千的流量
Twenty two thousands pages request.

305
00:18:27,698 --> 00:18:28,945
兩萬兩千次？
***

306
00:18:28,945 --> 00:18:31,264
這哥們黑了七棟樓的照片庫
This guy hack the facebook from 7 houses.

307
00:18:31,556 --> 00:18:34,201
一晚上就建起了網站 當時他還喝醉了
He set up the whole site in 1 night. And he did it while he was drunk.

308
00:18:34,201 --> 00:18:35,493
兩萬兩千
Twenty two thousands?

309
00:18:36,227 --> 00:18:37,038
你怎麼知道他醉了
How do you know his drunk?

310
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:40,215
他一邊做網站 還一邊寫博客
He was blogging simultaneously,

311
00:18:40,215 --> 00:18:42,635
- 你知道我怎麼想的嗎 - 說啊
- You know what I think? - I'm way ahead of you

312
00:18:42,892 --> 00:18:44,205
我們應該把他拉進來
This is our guy.

313
00:18:45,235 --> 00:18:51,212
卡梅隆·溫克艾沃斯 W-i-n-k-I-e-v-o-s-s 卡梅隆是普通拼法
Cameron Winklevoss, W-i-n-k-I-e-v-o-s-s, Cameron spell the usual way.

Mr. Zuckerberg, This in an Administration board hearing.

316
00:19:00,312 --> 00:19:04,890
在建造www.facemash.com網站的過程中
You're being accused of intentionally breaching security, violating copyrights,

317
00:19:04,948 --> 00:19:10,389

Violating individual privacy by creating the website www.facemash.com.

You're also charge with being in violation university policy on distribution of digitized imaging.

319
00:19:15,494 --> 00:19:20,042

Before we begin with our questioning you're allowed to make a statement, would you like to do so?

320
00:19:20,734 --> 00:19:27,597

I've, You know, I've already apologize to the Crimson, to the ABHW...

321
00:19:27,597 --> 00:19:33,220

To Fuerza Latina, and to any women in Harvard may have been insulted as I take it that they were.

322

As for any charges stemming from the breach from the security,

323
00:19:37,123 --> 00:19:40,201

I believe I deserve some recognition from this board.

324
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:43,428
你說什麼

325
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,453
沒錯
Yes.

326
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:47,289
- 我不懂 - 哪堣懂
- I don't understand... - Which part?

327
00:19:47,948 --> 00:19:49,668
你憑什麼值得認可
You deserve recognition?

328
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:52,543
我發現了你們安全系統中許多嚴重的漏洞
I believe, I pointed out some pretty gaping holes on your system...

329
00:19:52,543 --> 00:19:55,231

Mr. Zuckerberg. I'm in charge of security for all computer on the Harvard network.

331

我可以向你保證網絡的高端性能
And I can assure you of its sophistication.

332
00:20:03,129 --> 00:20:07,091
正是因為它優異的性能 我們在4個小時內就找到了你
In fact it was that level of sophistification that led us to you in for less than 4 hours.

333
00:20:07,091 --> 00:20:08,633
- 4個小時 - 沒錯
- Four hours? - Yes, sir.

334
00:20:08,633 --> 00:20:11,087

That would be impressive except if you had know what you lookin' for,

335
00:20:11,087 --> 00:20:13,089
那還算挺快的
You would've seen it written on my dorm room window.

336
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:21,640
- 那結果是 - 留校察看六個月
- So? - Six month academic probation.

337
00:20:22,164 --> 00:20:25,717
- 他們是想殺雞儆猴 - 他們查了我的博客
- Well, they making an example out of you. - They have my blog.

338
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,296
真不該寫家畜那些東西的 真傻
I shouldn't have write nothing about the farm animals. That was stupid.

339
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:32,116
不過我不就開個玩笑麼 現在的人怎麼一點幽默感都沒有
But, I was kidding, for god sake. Doesn't anybody have some sense of humour?

340
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:34,000
當時告訴你停下的
But I tried to stop you.

341
00:20:34,352 --> 00:20:35,228
我知道
***

342
00:20:35,286 --> 00:20:38,631
你怎麼做的 讓所有女生都討厭我們了
How do you do these thing, How you manage to get all girls to hate us.

343
00:20:38,631 --> 00:20:40,532
- 我當時怎麼就沒管住你 - 我知道
- Why do I let you... - I know.

344
00:20:40,729 --> 00:20:43,277
- 你不能那麼做 - 愛德華多 夠了
- Can't do that... - Eduardo, I said enough.

345
00:20:43,277 --> 00:20:44,986
讓我們看一個例子
Ok, let's look at a sample problem...

346
00:20:45,496 --> 00:20:51,686
假設我們有一台電腦 16比特的虛擬地址 256字節的頁面大小
Suppose we're given a computer with a 16-bit virtual address and a page size of 256 bytes.

347
00:20:52,173 --> 00:20:56,957
系統使用單級分頁 列表起始地址是0x400
The system uses one-level page tables, which start at address 0x400.

348
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:00,234
可能16位系統有直接內存訪問功能 無所謂 （你個混蛋）
Maybe you want to have DMA on your 16-bit system, who knows?

349
00:21:00,685 --> 00:21:03,871
前幾個頁面文件用於保存硬體標識等信息
The first few pages are reserved for hardware flags, etc.

350
00:21:03,885 --> 00:21:07,344
假定分頁表頭有八個狀態位
Assume page table entries have eight status bits.

351
00:21:07,418 --> 00:21:10,931
這八個狀態位是…有人知道嗎？
The eight status bits would then be... Anybody?

352
00:21:13,207 --> 00:21:15,034
我看到第一個退出的人了
And I see we have our first surrender.

353
00:21:15,514 --> 00:21:18,796
沒關係 扎克伯格先生 很多比你聰明的人也過不了這課
Don't worry, Mr. Zuckerberg, brighter men than you have tried and failed at this class.

354
00:21:18,796 --> 00:21:23,367
一個有效位 一個修改位 一個參考位  五個允許位
One valid bit, 1 modify bit, 1 reference bit and 5 permission bits.

355
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:27,270
答對了
That is correct.

356
00:21:27,718 --> 00:21:29,728
有人知道他怎麼算的嗎
***

357
00:21:35,455 --> 00:21:36,258

你是馬克·扎克伯格嗎？
Are you Mark Zuckerberg?

359
00:21:38,736 --> 00:21:39,679
是我
Yeah.

360
00:21:40,042 --> 00:21:42,245

361
00:21:42,245 --> 00:21:43,489

362
00:21:43,489 --> 00:21:44,781
你倆有什麼關係嗎
Are you guys related?

363
00:21:45,057 --> 00:21:46,109
- 不錯 - 真有趣
- It's good. - Funny.

364
00:21:46,109 --> 00:21:47,402
第一次有人這麼問
We never heard that before.

365
00:21:48,044 --> 00:21:50,123
找我有什麼事 我冒犯你們的女朋友了嗎
So what can I do for you? Did I insult your girlfriends?

366
00:21:50,123 --> 00:21:52,201
不 沒有 說實話 我還真不知道
No, we didn't, Actually... I don't know.

367
00:21:52,201 --> 00:21:53,896
- 我們還沒問過 - 或許是該問問了
- We never asked. - Maybe we should do that...

368
00:21:54,144 --> 00:21:57,423
我們有個想法想和你談談
** We have an idea we want to talk you about.

369
00:21:58,794 --> 00:21:59,481
有時間嗎？
Do you have a minute?

370
00:21:59,481 --> 00:22:01,943
你們看起來好像經常去健身
You guys look like you spend some time at a gym.

371
00:22:02,663 --> 00:22:04,528
- 沒辦法 - 為什麼
- We have to. - ***

372
00:22:04,528 --> 00:22:05,654
我們是賽艇隊的
We row crew.

373
00:22:07,274 --> 00:22:09,386
- 那我應該有時間了 - 很好
- Yeah, I've got a minute. - ***

- So you ever been in The Porcellian? - No

375
00:22:15,733 --> 00:22:18,619

Allright we gonna stay, we can't take you past the bike room 'cause you're not a member.

376
00:22:18,619 --> 00:22:19,703
我聽說了
I've heard.

377
00:22:23,115 --> 00:22:24,450
來點三明治什麼的嗎
Wanna sandwich or something?

378
00:22:25,137 --> 00:22:25,906
好的
ok.

379
00:22:25,906 --> 00:22:27,492
- 你就是馬克 - 對

- 馬克 這是迪維亞·納蘭德亞 我們的搭檔 - 你好
- Mark, this is Divya Narendra, our partner. - Hi.

加勒比海之夜
It was Caribbean night.

447
00:25:24,329 --> 00:25:27,060
雖然我們這種人對亞洲女孩沒什麼吸引力
It's not that guys like me are generally attracted to Asian girls.

448
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,662
但我們卻迷上了亞洲女孩
It's that Asian girls are generally attracted to guys like me.

449

我在研究一種算法 確定猶太人和亞洲姑娘的關係
I'm developing an algorithm to define the connection between Jewish guys and Asian girls.

I don't think it's that complicated. They're hot, They're smart,

00:25:40,263 --> 00:25:42,683
- 馬克來了 - 馬克

453
00:25:46,494 --> 00:25:47,504
失陪下
***

454
00:25:55,467 --> 00:25:56,354
我想到個點子

455
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:58,521
等等 我和你說個不可思議的事
Hang on, I've gotta tell you something you're not going to believe.

- 開玩笑吧 - 真的
- Are You kidding? - No.

458
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,812
只是四步程序的第一步
I mean it's just the first of the 4 step process,

459
00:26:06,812 --> 00:26:09,441
他們週一把邀請函塞到我門縫
But they slipped the invitation under my door tonight.

460
00:26:09,441 --> 00:26:11,710
明天我就要第一次參加派對了
I go to the first punch party tomorrow.

461
00:26:13,492 --> 00:26:15,059
鳳凰俱樂部邀請你了？
You got punch by The Phoenix.

462
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:18,361
沒錯 它可能真是個多元化的俱樂部
Yeah, probably, it was just a diversity thing.

463
00:26:18,621 --> 00:26:20,958
沒錯 就是 我還會這樣特立獨行下去
It was just a diversity thing. I'll just ride that horse until...

464
00:26:20,958 --> 00:26:22,401
你要跟我說什麼來著
What did you want to talk about?

465
00:26:23,027 --> 00:26:24,205
- 馬克 - 怎麼
- Mark? - Yeah.

466
00:26:24,205 --> 00:26:25,338
你說你找我有事
You said you've come up with something.

467
00:26:25,338 --> 00:26:27,792
沒錯 出來說
Yeah, I think I've come up with something. Come outside.

468
00:26:27,792 --> 00:26:29,360
外面才20度
It's 20 degrees outside.

469
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:33,873
我受不了那個尼亞加拉大瀑布 它和加勒比海有什麼關係啊
I can't stare to that loop of Niagara falls which has absolutely nothing to do with the Caribbean.

470
00:26:45,531 --> 00:26:47,562
人們會爭著上Facemash的對吧
People came to Facemash in a stampede, right?

471
00:26:47,562 --> 00:26:48,089
沒錯
Yeah.

472
00:26:48,089 --> 00:26:49,957
但這並不是因為他們想看美女
But it wasn't because the saw pictures of hot girls.

473
00:26:49,957 --> 00:26:51,949
因為在網上美女的照片到處都是
You can go any around on the internet and see pictures of hot girls.

474
00:26:51,949 --> 00:26:52,470
沒錯
Yeah.

475
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:55,347
這是因為他們能看到認識女生的照片
That was because they saw pictures of girls that they knew.

476
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,350
大家想上網看看他們的朋友
People wanna go on the internet and check out their friends,

477
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,811
為什麼我們不創建這樣一個網站呢
So why not build the website that offers that?

478
00:26:59,811 --> 00:27:03,683
你可以隨意瀏覽朋友照片 簡介之類的信息
Friends, pictures, profiles, whatever you can visit, browse around.

479
00:27:03,683 --> 00:27:07,269
甚至能訪問你在派對剛認識的女孩 我說的不是那種交友網站
Maybe its someone you just met at a party. But I'm not talkin' about a dating site.

480
00:27:07,269 --> 00:27:12,916
我指的是 將整個大學的社交網絡弄到網上去
I'm talkin' about taking the entire social experience of college and putting it online.

481
00:27:13,086 --> 00:27:14,030
我腿沒感覺了
I can't feel my legs

482
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:17,329
這太讓人興奮了 愛德華多
I know, I'm totally psyched about this. But Wardo...

483
00:27:17,329 --> 00:27:20,424
- 好 - 它是獨一無二的
- Yeah... - It would be exclusive.

484
00:27:20,457 --> 00:27:23,449
你必須認識網上那個人 才會同意他訪問你的頁面
You would've to know the people on the site to get pass thru on page.

485
00:27:23,449 --> 00:27:27,050
- 就像收到邀請一樣 - 不錯
- Like getting punched. - That's good

486
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:29,451
這就像終極俱樂部一樣 不同的是我們是主席
Wardo, it's like a Final Clubs except we're the president.

487
00:27:30,002 --> 00:27:32,069
我跟他說了 這是個好主意
I told him i thought it sounded great.

488
00:27:33,541 --> 00:27:34,787
這是個偉大的想法
It was a great idea.

489
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,040
用不著去偷
There's nothing to hack.

490
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:39,029
人們會上傳自己的照片 填寫自己的資料
People were gonna provide their own pictures, their own information.

491
00:27:39,029 --> 00:27:44,251
還可以選擇否邀請自己的好友加入這個網絡
And people had the ability to invite or not invite their friends to join.

492
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:47,485
就像一個完全由社會網絡構成的東西
See, in the world were the social structure was everything.

493
00:27:48,742 --> 00:27:50,340
它就是那樣一個東西
That was the "THING".

494
00:27:50,747 --> 00:27:52,140
這是個大工程
It was a big project.

495
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:55,234
他要為此編寫成千上萬行代碼
And he was going to have to write ten of thousands of lines of code.

496
00:27:55,234 --> 00:27:57,854
我當時還想 為什麼是他 而不是他室友來找我
So I wonder, why he was coming to me and not to his room mate.

497
00:27:57,854 --> 00:28:00,840
達斯汀·摩斯克維茨 和克奡窗P休斯都是程序員
Dustin Moskowitz and Chris Hughes they're programmers.

498
00:28:01,003 --> 00:28:04,246
我們當時需要一點資金 租個服務器傳到網上去
We're gonna need a little start-up cash to rent the servers and get it online.

499
00:28:05,468 --> 00:28:06,271
那就是原因
So that was why.

500
00:28:06,271 --> 00:28:08,357
- 他提條件了嗎 - 當然
- Did he offers terms? - Yes.

501
00:28:08,357 --> 00:28:10,175
我們分成 三七開
We'll split it. 70-30

502
00:28:10,175 --> 00:28:12,927
我拿七成 你拿三成 你負責投資上千的美金
Seventy for me, Thirty for you for you, putting up a thousands dollar.

503
00:28:12,927 --> 00:28:15,212
還有處理一切生意上的事情 你做首席財務官
And for handling everything on the business end. You're CFO

504
00:28:15,397 --> 00:28:17,794
- 你怎麼說 - 我說 大展身手吧
- And you said? - I said "Let's do it"

505
00:28:17,794 --> 00:28:21,556
- 好的 他還說了什麼沒有 - 有
- Ok, did he add anything else? - Yes.

506
00:28:24,955 --> 00:28:27,315
也許是個多元的俱樂部
It probably was a diversity thing

507
00:28:28,929 --> 00:28:29,985
但又如何呢
but so what?

508
00:28:30,301 --> 00:28:31,449
你覺得他為什麼要這麼說
Why do you think he said that?

509
00:28:31,449 --> 00:28:33,801
格雷琴 抱歉打斷你 但這又是誰的發現呢
Gretchen, excuse me for interrupting, But whose discovery it is?

510
00:28:33,801 --> 00:28:36,289
- 塞 如果你讓我繼續問下去的話… - 你又想暗示什麼
- Sy, if you let me continue with my line of question... - What do you suggesting?

511
00:28:36,289 --> 00:28:39,168
他們在暗示我嫉妒愛德華多 被鳳凰俱樂部邀請了
They're suggesting I was jealous of Eduardo for getting punched by Phoenix.

512
00:28:39,168 --> 00:28:41,888
於是決定設計把他排擠出 一個我還沒設立的公司
and began a plan to screw him out of the company I haven't even invented yet.

513
00:28:41,888 --> 00:28:42,700
- 不是嗎 - 格雷琴…
- Were you? - Gretchen...

514
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,944
我嫉妒愛德華多？
Jealous of Eduardo?

515
00:28:43,944 --> 00:28:45,296
哦 別記下來 這話不用記錄
Oh, stop typing, we're off the record.

516
00:28:45,296 --> 00:28:46,348
女士 我知道你好好調查了一番
Maam, I know you've done your home work.

517
00:28:46,348 --> 00:28:48,239
所以說你肯定知道錢並非是我生活的重心
And so you know that money isn't a big part of my life,

518
00:28:48,239 --> 00:28:50,052
但現在我可以買下整條奧本大街
But at the moment I could buy I could buy Mt. Auburn Street,

519
00:28:50,052 --> 00:28:53,106
買下鳳凰俱樂部 再把它變成我的乒乓室
Take the Phoenix Club and turn it into my pingpong room.

520
00:28:57,647 --> 00:28:59,352
回頭告訴你派對的情況
I'll let you know how the party is,

521
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:10,472
我們發現您在涉及Facebook的案件中 一起是原告 一起是證人
We recognize that you're a plaintiff in one suit involving Facebook and a witness in another.

522
00:29:10,472 --> 00:29:12,724
- 是的 先生 - 在馬克告訴你他的想法
- Yes, Sir. - At any time In the weeks,

523
00:29:12,724 --> 00:29:14,259
之前的幾周內
prior to Mark telling you his idea,

524
00:29:14,259 --> 00:29:19,480
他有沒有提起過泰勒和卡梅隆·溫克艾沃斯 迪維亞·納蘭德拉或者是"哈佛關係網"？
Did he mention Tyler Winklevoss, Cameron Winklevoss, Divya Narendra or HarvardConnection?

525
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:22,301
有 他說他們邀請他去建設他們的網站
Yes. He said they'd asked him to work on their site.

526
00:29:22,433 --> 00:29:25,824
但是他一看到他們的成果後 就覺得不值得他花時間去做
But that he'd looked at what they had and decided it wasn't worth his time.

527
00:29:26,358 --> 00:29:31,743
他說哪怕是他最爛的朋友都比這些人要懂得如何使一個網站吸引人
He said even his most pathetic friends knew more about getting people interested in a website than these guys.

528
00:29:31,912 --> 00:29:33,749
"這些人" 指的是我的客戶們
"These guys" meaning my clients.

529
00:29:33,749 --> 00:29:37,520
對 他很討厭 馬克很討厭他們 就是你的客戶們
Yes. He resented, Mark resented that they, that your clients,

530
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,714
覺得他在經歷了Facemash事件後 需要恢復形象
thought that he need to rehabilitate his image after the Facemash thing

531
00:29:40,714 --> 00:29:42,233
但其實馬克什麼都不想恢復
but Mark didn't want to rehabilitate anything.

532
00:29:42,233 --> 00:29:46,946
他用Facemash黑了哈佛的電腦系統 進入了董事會的系統內
With Facemash he'd hack into Harvard computers, he dumps his nose to the Ad Board.

533
00:29:46,946 --> 00:29:50,500
聲譽滿載 Facemash成就了 他夢寐以求的一切
He got a lot of honorarity. Facemash did exactly what he wanted it to do.

534
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,422
您是否知道 在建設Facebook的同時
Were you aware that while Mr. Zuckerberg was building the Facebook,

535
00:29:53,422 --> 00:29:55,349
扎克伯格先生在同原告接觸？
He was also communicating with the plaintiffs?

536
00:29:55,349 --> 00:29:57,901
那時候我還不知道 但是…
Not at the time I wasn't. But...

537
00:29:59,503 --> 00:30:02,289
我知道他沒有忙著搞 溫克艾沃斯兄弟的交友網站
It really didn't have much to do with The Winkelvoss dating site.

538
00:30:02,289 --> 00:30:04,490
你怎麼知道的 你都沒有…
How would you know? You' weren't even...

539
00:30:04,923 --> 00:30:07,927
您是否知道 扎克伯格先生 在建設Facebook的同時
Were you aware that while Mr. Zuckerberg was building TheFacebook,

540
00:30:07,927 --> 00:30:11,249
他誤導原告使之相信 他是在建設"哈佛關係網"？
He was leading the plaintiffs to believe he was building HarvardConnection?

541
00:30:11,249 --> 00:30:13,186
你這是沒有證據 臆推結論
You're offering a conclusion not found an evidence.

542
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:15,248
現在我就給你看證據…
We are about to finding an evidence...

543
00:30:16,328 --> 00:30:20,562
這封是馬克·扎克伯格於2003年11月30日發給泰勒·溫克艾沃斯的郵件
From Mark Zuckerberg to Tyler Winklevoss November 30, 2003

544

I read over all the stuff you sent me re-HarvardConnection,

545
00:30:23,547 --> 00:30:26,183
看上去不需要花很多時間就能完成了
and it seems like it shouldn't take too long to implement,

546
00:30:26,183 --> 00:30:30,763
等我明晚準備好所有基礎設備 我們再仔細談談"
so we can talk about it after I get all the basic functionality up tomorrow night.

547
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:35,686

"This week has been pretty busy thus far with classes and work"

552
00:30:49,909 --> 00:30:52,497
所以我覺得還是推遲會面吧"
"So I think it's probably best to postpone the meeting."

553
00:30:52,497 --> 00:30:55,235
"明天我也很忙"
"I'm also really busy tomorrow"

554
00:30:55,398 --> 00:30:58,214
好吧 大夥兒有沒有覺得這傢伙有點奇怪？
***

555
00:30:58,952 --> 00:31:03,158
告訴他可以 但是我們必須 在休假前碰一次面
Tell him okay but we do have to make sure that we meet up before we all head off for break.

556
00:31:03,371 --> 00:31:05,618
我知道 我知道 好的 回見
***

557
00:31:37,436 --> 00:31:38,107
- 嗨 馬克 - 嗨
- Hi Mark, - Hi,

我需要一台Linux專用的主機來運作Apache系統 後台要MySQL的
I need a dedicated Linux box running Apache with a mySQL back-end.

559
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,873
這要花多點小錢
It's gonna cost a little more money.

560
00:31:42,873 --> 00:31:44,866
- 大概要多多少？ - 大概要多200
- How much more? - About 200 more.

561
00:31:45,454 --> 00:31:48,361

562
00:31:51,099 --> 00:31:52,640
- 那買吧 - 我已經買好了
- Do it. - I already did.

563
00:31:57,575 --> 00:31:58,819
嘿 你猜怎麼著
Hey guess what...

564
00:32:00,259 --> 00:32:01,665
我進了第二輪了
I'm in the 2nd cut.

565
00:32:02,577 --> 00:32:04,711
很好啊 你該自豪了
That's good. You should be proud of that right there,

566
00:32:04,711 --> 00:32:06,729
要是沒晉級千萬別難過
Don't worry if you don't make it any further.

567
00:32:12,298 --> 00:32:13,571
我這就走
I'll get out of here.

568

還有迪維亞·納蘭德拉的郵件
December 15, 2003.

570
00:32:19,635 --> 00:32:22,295
我有個代碼段出了問題 我這才著手解決
I have a cs problem set that I'm just getting started with,

571
00:32:22,295 --> 00:32:25,591
大概要編15個小時的程 所以明晚我很忙
And It should be about 15 hours of coding so I'll be busy tomorrow night,

00:32:25,591 --> 00:32:29,145
要到下個禮拜三下午我才有空會面
I won't really be free to meet until next Wednesday afternoon.

573

禮拜三下午我也不能來了
I have to cancel Wednesday afternoon.

574
00:32:31,539 --> 00:32:34,516
這段時間我一直混在實驗室 而且…
I've basically been in the lab this whole time and also...

575
00:32:34,516 --> 00:32:39,318

Won't be able to do it Saturday as I have to meet up with my parents...

576
00:32:43,303 --> 00:32:48,095
石板上寫著 這位是約翰·哈佛 他於1638年創建了哈佛大學
As the plaque reads, this is John Harvard, founder of Harvard University in 1638.

577
00:32:48,204 --> 00:32:50,749
這也被稱為三大謊言雕像
It's also called The Statue of Three Lies.

578
00:32:51,201 --> 00:32:53,752
那三大謊言是什麼呢
What are the three lies?

579
00:32:53,823 --> 00:32:55,119
道得先生
Mr. Dowd.

580
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:56,405
三大謊言
The three lies,

581
00:32:56,405 --> 00:32:58,576
一…該死
First... Shit!

582
00:32:58,576 --> 00:33:00,720
- 把褲子脫了 - 我早知道
- Take your pants off. - I know.

583
00:33:01,738 --> 00:33:03,089
薩佛林先生
Mr. Saverin.

584
00:33:03,089 --> 00:33:06,668
一 哈佛於1636年創建 而非1638
1) Harvard was founded in 1636 not 1638.

585
00:33:06,668 --> 00:33:09,247
二 哈佛的創始人並非約翰·哈佛
2) Harvard was not founded by John Harvard

586
00:33:09,247 --> 00:33:10,630
還有 這不是約翰·哈佛的雕像
and 3) That's not John Harvard.

587
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:11,882
那他又是誰？
Who is it?

588
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:16,611
雕…雕塑家的好友 丹尼爾…切斯特
F-friend of the sculptor, Daniel... Chester.

589
00:33:17,532 --> 00:33:18,662
把外套穿上吧
Keep you jacket on.

590
00:33:22,253 --> 00:33:25,847
繼與我客戶們的首次見面的39天之後
39 days after Mr. Zuckerberg's initial meeting with my clients

591
00:33:25,847 --> 00:33:29,192
扎克伯格先生依然沒有完成 建設"哈佛關係網"的工作
And he still hadn't completed work on HarvardConnection.

592
00:33:29,192 --> 00:33:32,220
但是在2004年1月11日
But On January 11, 2004

593
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:39,094
扎克伯格先生在Network Solution上註冊了Facebook的域名
Mr. Zuckerberg registered the domain name the facebook by Network Solution.

594
00:33:40,147 --> 00:33:43,859
請問您是否知道 他到底有沒有 著手建設"哈佛關係網"？
To the best of your knowledge, had he even begun work on HarvardConnection?

595
00:33:45,021 --> 00:33:47,479
據我所知 沒有
Not to my knowledge. No.

596
00:33:54,730 --> 00:34:00,179
嗨 卡梅隆 "我依然懷疑 我們網站的功能夠不夠吸引
Hi Cameroon, "I'm still a little skeptical that we have enough functionality in the site to really draw the attention

597
00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:03,817
並獲得維繫網站的評論關注"
And gain the critical mass necessary to get a site like this to run"

598
00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:06,353
我們來日再談？
We'll speak soon?

599
00:34:08,576 --> 00:34:11,374
這是否為第一次他提出困難？
This is the first time he mentioned any problem?

600
00:34:11,374 --> 00:34:12,002
是的
Yes, he was

601
00:34:12,002 --> 00:34:16,882
你們共給扎克伯格先生發了36封電郵 收到了16封回復
You'd sent 36 e-mails to Mr. Zuckerberg and received 16 e-mails in return,

602
00:34:16,882 --> 00:34:19,660
而這是第一次他提到自己不太樂意
And this was the first time he indicated that he's not happy.

603
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:20,563
沒錯
That's correct!

604
00:34:20,563 --> 00:34:23,408
他花了42天來研究我們的系統 然後捷足先登
He had 42 days to study our system and get out ahead...

605
00:34:23,408 --> 00:34:25,079
你看到Facebook上有一條你的代碼嗎
Do you see any of your code on Facebook?

606
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:27,263
- 塞 - 我用了你們的代碼嗎
- *** - Did I use any of your code?

607
00:34:27,263 --> 00:34:29,070
你偷的他媽的是我們整個創意
You stole our whole god damn idea.

608
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,080
夥計們
Fellas,

609
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,974
- 哈佛人上的交友網站啊 - 我能繼續讀證據材料嗎
- What a match-dot-com for Harvard guys! - Can I continue with my deposition

610
00:34:32,974 --> 00:34:35,813
你們真的不必請一個鑒證組來調查
You know you really don't need a forensic team to get to bottom of this

611
00:34:35,813 --> 00:34:40,434
如果你們覺得自己是Facebook的創建者 你們得創造出一個Facebook來
If you guys were the inventors of Facebook you'd have invented Facebook.

612
00:34:41,601 --> 00:34:44,957
我真等不及踩扁你 等你賠償了
I can't wait to stand over your shoulder while you write us a check.

613
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:46,141
才怪
No Shit.

614
00:34:47,641 --> 00:34:48,886
繼續吧
Let's continue.

615
00:34:50,465 --> 00:34:53,581
2004年2月4日
February 4, 2004

616
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:59,304
馬克… 馬克…
Mark... Mark...

617
00:34:59,729 --> 00:35:03,303
你藝術史課上有個女生 叫斯蒂芬妮·艾提絲
There is a girl in your art history class name Stephanie Attis.

618
00:35:03,303 --> 00:35:05,387
你知不知道她有沒有男朋友啊
Do you happen to know if she has a boyfriend?

619
00:35:07,034 --> 00:35:09,267
你有沒有看到過她跟別人在一起？
Have you ever seen her with anyone.

620
00:35:10,793 --> 00:35:15,234
要是沒有的話 你知不知道 她想不想找一個男朋友？
And if not, do you happen to know if she's looking to go out with anyone?

621
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:20,372
人們又不在胸口掛牌 告訴別人…
People don't walk around with a sign on them that says some...

622
00:35:25,235 --> 00:35:26,114
馬克？
***

623
00:35:52,991 --> 00:35:54,197
我們該9點碰頭的
We were supposed to meet at 9

624
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:57,458
- 你有睡過覺麼 - 我要加點東西上去
- Have you slept yet? - I've to add something.

625
00:35:58,197 --> 00:35:58,942
什麼
What?

626
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:12,378
哇 這看上去不錯 這看上去真的不錯
Shit that's look good, That's look really good.

627
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:15,932
簡單了當 不花哨
It's clean and simple, no disneyland...

628
00:36:15,932 --> 00:36:16,965
但是看著
But watch...

629
00:36:18,326 --> 00:36:19,311
你寫了什麼
What'd you write?

630
00:36:20,098 --> 00:36:22,972
感情狀態 對某人感興趣

現在 拿出你的筆記本

為什麼要我的筆記本

Good point, 'cause Cole Porter and Irving Berlin never wrote any love songs.

671
00:38:30,479 --> 00:38:32,507

歡迎來到Facebook

"Everyone's been talking a lot about a universal facebook within Harvard"

695
00:40:06,702 --> 00:40:08,300
"他"就是馬克
***

696
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:11,543
"我覺得大學這麼多年 還沒搞出來是挺傻的"
I think it's kind of silly that it would take the University a couple of years to get around to it.

697
00:40:11,543 --> 00:40:14,190
"我做得這麼精妙 而他們不行 而且我只用了一個禮拜的時間"
I can do it in class jobs than they can't and I did it in a week.

698
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:17,186
- 告訴他 迪維亞·納蘭德拉打電話來過 感激不盡 - 這就是我們說的
- Tell him, Divya Narendra called, I appreciate it. - That's how we talks.

699
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:23,583

Divya was just reading that 650 students signed up on the first day

702
00:40:30,591 --> 00:40:34,955
要是我是個毒販子 一天也能向650個人派免費毒品
If I was I drug dealer I could give free drugs to 650 people in one day.

703
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:38,508

- This guy doesn't have 3 friends to rob... - Guys, please, come on...

704
00:40:38,799 --> 00:40:41,769
好的 我們會辦到的 霍奇基斯先生 我們整理好資料 然後電郵給你
Alright that's what we'll do, Mr. Hotchkiss ** Then we e-mail it to you.

705
00:40:42,478 --> 00:40:44,806
你自己上不了那個網站
You won't be able to get on the website yourself.

706
00:40:44,806 --> 00:40:47,394
因為你沒有哈佛的 呃
Because you don't have a harvard... uhm..

707
00:40:47,394 --> 00:40:49,571
還是我們電郵給你比較方便
you know what it would be easy for us to e-mail it to you.

708
00:40:50,247 --> 00:40:51,647
我相信你說的沒錯 他是個好人
I'm sure you right... He's a good guy,

709
00:40:51,647 --> 00:40:56,310
他很聰明 我知道 他並非故意…這麼做的
And he's very bright and I'm sure he didn't mean to... do what he did.

710
00:40:56,893 --> 00:40:58,080
好的 非常感謝
Alright, thank you very much...

711
00:40:58,163 --> 00:41:00,407
爸爸 我們也愛你

712
00:41:00,407 --> 00:41:01,775
他是個好人？
He good guy?

713
00:41:01,775 --> 00:41:03,010
我們不知道他是不是個壞人
We don't know that he's not a good guy.

714
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:04,295
我們知道他偷了我們的想法
We know he Stole our idea

715
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,155
我們知道他當著我們的面 騙了我們一個半月
We know that he lied to our faces for a month and half

716
00:41:06,155 --> 00:41:06,871
他從沒當著我們的面
He never lie to our face

717
00:41:06,871 --> 00:41:09,626
他是從見著我們的面 但他用郵件扯謊了
He never saw our faces! Fine, he lied to our e-mail accounts.

718
00:41:09,626 --> 00:41:11,618
然後領先了我們42天
So he got himself 42-days head start

719
00:41:11,618 --> 00:41:15,505
因為他知道的你不知道 那就是先發制人才有勝算
He knows what apparently you don't which is that getting there first is everything.

720
00:41:15,505 --> 00:41:16,859
我有的是競爭意識 迪夫
I'm a competitive racer, Div,

721
00:41:16,859 --> 00:41:19,953
你沒必要對我嘮叨 搶佔先機的重要性 謝謝
I don't think you need to school me on the importance of getting there first. Thank you.

722
00:41:19,953 --> 00:41:21,654
好吧 剛那是你爸的律師？
Alright, that's was your father's lawyer?

723
00:41:21,654 --> 00:41:22,540
對 是他的法律顧問
Yeah, well his in-house counsel.

724
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:25,570
他會來查看資料 如果覺得合適的話 他去函要求他罷手
He's gonna look at all this if he thinks it's appropriate he'll send a cease and desist letter.

725
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:26,378
這有什麼用
***

726
00:41:26,378 --> 00:41:28,213
這麼 你還想要請一位 知識產權律師來起訴他麼
What, do you wanna hire an IP lawyer and sue him?

727
00:41:28,213 --> 00:41:31,350
不 我想請黑幫用錘子好好地揍他一頓
No, I wanna hire the Sopranos to beat the shit out of him with a hammer!

728
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:32,809
- 我們不必這麼做 - 沒錯
- We don't have to do that. - That's right.

729
00:41:32,809 --> 00:41:34,011
我們可以自己下手
We can do that ourself.

730
00:41:34,011 --> 00:41:36,791
- 我6尺5寸 220磅 而且我們還是兩個人 - 我同意他的觀點
I'm six-five, 220lbs, and there's two of me. I'm with this guy.

731
00:41:36,791 --> 00:41:39,686
好吧 我只能說我們得冷靜一下 再來看看該怎麼處理
Whatever, I'm saying let's calm down until we know what we're talking about.

732
00:41:39,686 --> 00:41:41,905
你還要等多少資料
how much more information are you waiting for.

733
00:41:41,905 --> 00:41:46,226
我們見過馬克三次 互發了52封電郵 我們可以證明他偷看了我們的代碼
We met with Mark 3 times, exchanged 52 e-mails, we can prove that he looked at the code...

734
00:41:46,226 --> 00:41:47,936
這頁面下面寫的什麼
what is that on the bottom of page

735
00:41:47,936 --> 00:41:49,111
寫著"馬克·扎克伯格出品"
It's "A Mark Zuckerberg production"

736
00:41:49,111 --> 00:41:52,007
- 主頁上嗎 - 每一頁都有
- On the homepage? - On every pages.

737
00:41:52,173 --> 00:41:54,828
該死 幹得太漂亮了
Shit. I need to let the classiness waft over me.

738
00:41:54,828 --> 00:41:55,728
好吧 聽著
Ok, look...

739
00:41:55,728 --> 00:41:58,040
上面寫著"扎克伯格說希望 這些保密性的選擇
They wrote, "Zuckerberg said that he hoped the privacy options...

740
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:02,777
能為他挽回聲譽 Facemash.com的事情他犯了眾怒"
...would help to restore his reputation following student outrage over Facemash.com"

741
00:42:02,777 --> 00:42:06,515
這正是我們對他說的話 他這是挑釁我們
That's exactly what we said to him. He's giving us "the finger" in the Crimson

742
00:42:07,378 --> 00:42:10,477
我們這麼乾坐著等老爸的律師來處理 我們至少該寫點什麼反駁…
While we're waiting for dad's lawyer to look this stuff over, we can at least...

743
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:11,994
- 不 - 讓大家知道…
- No... - ***

744
00:42:11,994 --> 00:42:13,238
這沒什麼好爭的!
***

745
00:42:13,238 --> 00:42:16,925
我們不能跟他打筆仗 也不能起訴他
We're not starting a knife fight in the Crimson and we're not suing anybody.

746
00:42:16,925 --> 00:42:18,119
為什麼
Why not?

747
00:42:20,217 --> 00:42:21,823
我不明白 為什麼不能
***

748
00:42:23,254 --> 00:42:24,734
他會說我蠢的
He's gonna say it's stupid.

749
00:42:25,544 --> 00:42:26,410
什麼 誰 我嗎
What, who? Me?

750
00:42:26,819 --> 00:42:28,221
說呀 為什麼不
Say it why not?

751
00:42:29,322 --> 00:42:31,501
因為我們是哈佛的紳士
Because we're gentlemen of Harvard.

752
00:42:31,501 --> 00:42:36,071
這堿O哈佛 不能說別人壞話 也不能起訴別人
This is Harvard. Where you don't plant stories and you don't sue people.

753
00:42:36,673 --> 00:42:39,358
你覺得就他會說你蠢嗎
You thought he was going to be the only one who thought that was stupid?

754
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:42,617
當時你說自己有這個想法
During the time when you say you had this idea,

755
00:42:42,617 --> 00:42:46,269
你是否知道泰勒和卡梅隆出身名門？
Did you know Tyler and Cameron came from a family of means?

756
00:42:47,045 --> 00:42:48,349
名門？
A family of means?

757
00:42:48,349 --> 00:42:50,166
你是否知道他們的父親很有錢
Did you know that his father was wealthy.

758
00:42:51,484 --> 00:42:52,861
我不知道你為什麼要問我這個
I'm not sure why you're asking me that.

759
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:54,990
這不重要 你肯定知道我為什麼要問你
It's not important that you be sure why I'm asking you.

760
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:56,036
對你是不重要
It's not important to you.

761
00:42:56,036 --> 00:42:57,329
塞…
Sy...

762
00:42:58,262 --> 00:43:00,055
你知不知道他們家很有錢
Did you know that they came from money?

763
00:43:00,206 --> 00:43:02,134
我不知道他們家有沒有錢
I had no idea whether they came from money or not.

764
00:43:02,134 --> 00:43:07,648
在一封你給納蘭德拉先生的電郵 你提到了一家叫泰特·溫克艾沃斯的投資顧問公司
In one of your e-mails to Mr. Narendra you reference Tate Winklevoss consulting firm.

765
00:43:07,648 --> 00:43:08,695
你說有就有了
If you say so.

766
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:12,649
霍華德·溫克艾沃斯創建了這家公司 市值上億
Howard Winklevoss founded the firm and its assets are in the hundreds of millions.

767
00:43:12,683 --> 00:43:17,646
你還知道泰勒及卡梅隆是 哈佛終極俱樂部坡斯廉的成員
You also knew that Tyler and Cameron were members of a Harvard Final club called the Porcellian.

768
00:43:17,646 --> 00:43:20,257
- 他們對我說過了 - 抱歉我們邀請你了
- They pointed that out? - Excuse us for inviting you in.

769
00:43:20,257 --> 00:43:21,583
請我去停車庫
To the bike room...

770
00:43:22,197 --> 00:43:25,328
所以說 可以認為 你是知道我的客戶們很有錢了
So it's safe to say you were aware that my clients had money?

771
00:43:27,172 --> 00:43:29,126
- 是的 - 我來告訴你為什麼要這麼問
- Yes. - Let me tell you why I'm asking.

772
00:43:29,126 --> 00:43:30,254
我在想
I'm wondering why...

773
00:43:30,254 --> 00:43:34,458
當你的互聯網生意需要1000美金投資時 你為什麼沒有問我的客戶們要
If you needed a $1000 for an internet venture you didn't ask my clients for it.

774
00:43:34,458 --> 00:43:37,142
他們會告訴你其中的利弊…
They'd demonstrated to you an interest in this kind of thing...

775
00:43:37,142 --> 00:43:40,030
我去問我的朋友要錢投資是因為我想讓他成為我的合夥人
I went to my friend for the money because that he's who I wanted to be partners with...

776
00:43:40,238 --> 00:43:44,534
愛德華多是哈佛投資者協會的主席 同時也是我的摯交好友
Eduardo was presidents of the Harvard Inverstors Association and he was also my best friend.

777
00:43:45,693 --> 00:43:49,572
你的摯交好友正起訴你 問你要6億美金呢
Your best friend is suing you for 600 million dollars.

778
00:43:49,572 --> 00:43:51,557
我不知道 你來告訴我吧
I didn't know that. tell me more!

779
00:43:51,557 --> 00:43:54,237
愛德華多 首次發佈之後情況如何
Eduardo, what happen after the initial lunch?

780
00:43:54,237 --> 00:43:56,681
塞 能否稱呼我的客戶為薩佛林先生
Sy would you mind addressing as Mr. Saverin

781
00:43:56,681 --> 00:43:58,603
- 格雷琴 他們是摯交好友 - 不再是了
- Gretchen, they're best friend - Not anymore

782
00:43:58,603 --> 00:44:00,014
我之前就已經…
I already went through this on the...

783
00:44:00,068 --> 00:44:01,622
算了 薩佛林先生…
Nevermind, Mr. Saverin...

784
00:44:01,622 --> 00:44:03,481
首次發佈之後情況如何
***

785
00:44:03,481 --> 00:44:06,483
簡直就和爆炸一樣 校園堜狾酗H都在用
It's exploded, everybody on campus was using it

786
00:44:06,483 --> 00:44:10,299
兩個禮拜之後 大家見面就說 "上Facebook加我"
"Facebook-me" was the common expression after two weeks.

787
00:44:10,299 --> 00:44:11,962
而馬克呢
and Mark...

788
00:44:11,962 --> 00:44:16,107
馬克成了校園堻怜{亮的人物 一舉擊敗了19位諾貝爾獲獎者
And Mark was biggest thing on a campus that included 19 Nobel Laureates,

789
00:44:16,107 --> 00:44:19,795
15位普利策獎獲得者 兩位未來的奧林匹克冠軍
15 Pulitzer Prize Winners, two future Olympians

790
00:44:19,795 --> 00:44:20,912
和一位電影明星
and a movie star.

791
00:44:20,912 --> 00:44:22,165
電影明星是誰
Who's the movie star?

792
00:44:22,616 --> 00:44:23,608
有關係嗎
Does it matter?

793
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:24,900
沒有
No.

794
00:44:33,739 --> 00:44:36,291
那天天氣很好 我去了位於拉德克利夫的宿舍
Beautiful day. And I was up in my Radcliffe dorm.

795
00:44:36,291 --> 00:44:38,068
他帶了那本雜誌給我看
He brought that magazine up and he saw it to me

796
00:44:38,068 --> 00:44:41,863
他說"看 再不動手就輪不到我們了"
And he said, "Look, it's gonna happen without us. We've got to start now."

797
00:44:42,488 --> 00:44:43,540
我說 "好吧"
And I said... "Okay."

798
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:46,000
我們去買基礎硬體
Let's get basic hardware.

799
00:44:46,299 --> 00:44:48,929
許多人都以為自己知道後續的事情 但其實並非如此
Most of you think you know the rest of story that you may not.

800
00:44:48,929 --> 00:44:51,389
開始挺寒酸的
The beginning of the industry were very humble...

801
00:44:51,483 --> 00:44:55,700
那台雜誌封面上的組裝機上 搭載的是8080處理器
That kit computer on the cover of that magazine, had an 8080 processor in it.

802
00:44:55,700 --> 00:45:00,065
除非你再加錢買一個1K內存擴展板 不然的話只有256比特的儲存空間
Unless you paid extra for 1K memory board 256bits,

803
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:04,807
所以我們的挑戰並非是 運行一台4K比特的電腦
so the challenges *** but,

804
00:45:04,807 --> 00:45:09,128
而是要留下運行程序的空間
****

805
00:45:10,326 --> 00:45:13,300
你的朋友 是叫馬克·扎克伯格嗎
*** Isn't that Mark Zuckerberg?

806
00:45:13,479 --> 00:45:14,175
對
Yeah

807
00:45:14,175 --> 00:45:16,743
- 他創造了Facebook？ - 對
- He made facebook? - Yeah.

808
00:45:16,743 --> 00:45:21,000
我是說我們倆創造了 對 我們… 對
I mean both of us. Yeah, we... yes.

809
00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:24,395
酷 我叫克奡絡式P李 這位是愛麗絲
Cool. I'm Christy Lee. This is Alice.

810
00:45:24,395 --> 00:45:25,455
嗨
hi.

811
00:45:25,949 --> 00:45:27,807
很高興見到你們
Nice to meet you

812
00:45:28,198 --> 00:45:31,386
回家後上Facebook加我 我們出去喝一杯
Facebook-me when you get home We can all go out and grab a drink.

813
00:45:31,819 --> 00:45:34,522
當然了 我一定會的
Certainly, absolutely will do that.

814
00:45:41,449 --> 00:45:44,806
她說"上Facebook加我" 還有我們出去喝一杯
She said "Facebook-me" and we can all go for a drink later.

815
00:45:44,806 --> 00:45:46,597
有兩個理由 為什麼這句話太棒了
Which is stunningly great for two reasons.

816
00:45:46,597 --> 00:45:49,234
首先 她說"上Facebook加我" 對麼？ 然後…
One she said "Facebook-me". Right? And the other...

817
00:45:49,234 --> 00:45:50,238
- 她們想要出去喝杯 - 對
- They wanna have drinks later. - Yes

818
00:45:50,238 --> 00:45:53,533
你有聽到過一句話 有這麼多好事兒嗎
Have you ever heard so many different good things packed into one regular-sized sentence?

819
00:45:53,533 --> 00:45:54,850
抱歉 馬克？
Excuse me. Mark?

820
00:45:55,798 --> 00:45:56,460
對
Yeah

821
00:45:57,111 --> 00:45:59,473
我是斯圖爾特·辛格 我在你的操作系統實驗室
I'm Stuart Singer. I'm in your O.S. lab.

822
00:45:59,473 --> 00:46:00,505
對
Sure.

823
00:46:01,007 --> 00:46:03,393
- Facebook搞得真棒 - 太棒了
- Awesome job with theFacebook. - Awesome Job.

824
00:46:03,547 --> 00:46:05,240
- 謝謝 - 我叫鮑勃
- Thanks. - I'm Bob.

825
00:46:05,544 --> 00:46:06,972
- 你好 - 你知道 我發誓
- How are you doin'. - You know, I could swear..

826
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:10,468
他說這房間埵酗U一位比爾蓋茨 當時他就看著你
he was looking at you when he said The next Bill Gates could be right in this room.

827
00:46:10,925 --> 00:46:12,102
不一定吧
I doubt it

828
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:14,728
我來晚了 我都不知道發言人是誰
I showed up late, I don't even know who the speaker was.

829
00:46:16,372 --> 00:46:17,664
就是比爾蓋茨
It was Bill Gates.

830
00:46:19,029 --> 00:46:20,692
該死 這就說得通了
Shit... that's make sense.

831
00:46:21,869 --> 00:46:23,654
好吧 謝謝各位了
Alright, thanks guys.

832
00:46:26,755 --> 00:46:28,300
你傻了還是你腦殘了？
Are you moron? Are you medically stupid?

833
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:30,319
比爾蓋茨在你眼前 晃了一個小時你都沒認出來？
You can't recognize Bill Gates in front of you for an hour?

834
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:32,298
現在馬克·扎克伯格會覺得我們是拿了殘奧會獎學金進的哈佛…
Mark Zuckerberg now thinks we got into Harvard on a dimwit scholarship.

835
00:46:32,298 --> 00:46:34,033
我要去找把格洛克斃了你
I'm gonna get a Glock...

836
00:46:36,063 --> 00:46:37,561
我們得把這東西套現了
It's time to monetize the thing.

837
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:38,795
他們是從哪兒來的
What are their natives?

838
00:46:39,186 --> 00:46:40,589
- 你聽到我說的話了嗎 - 什麼話
- Did you heard what I just said? - When?

839
00:46:41,015 --> 00:46:43,172
我說是時候把網站套現了
I said it's times to monetize the site

840
00:46:43,976 --> 00:46:45,046
什麼意思
What is that mean?

841
00:46:45,046 --> 00:46:47,908
意思說該讓網站開始盈利了
It means time for the website generating the revenue.

842
00:46:47,908 --> 00:46:50,661
不 我知道那個詞什麼意思 我是問你要這麼做
No, I know what the word means. I'm asking how do you want to do it?

843
00:46:51,652 --> 00:46:52,687
- 廣告 - 不
- Advertising. - No.

844
00:46:54,826 --> 00:46:57,258
- 我們有4000個成員 - 因為Facebook很酷
- We've got 4000 members. - 'Cause theFacebook is cool.

845
00:46:57,258 --> 00:47:00,119
要是我們開始彈百事的小廣告 那就不酷了
And if we start selling pop-ups for Mountain Dew it's not gonna be cool.

846
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:01,997
我倒是沒有想到百事廣告 不過…
Well I wasn't thinking it would be Mountain Dew but at some point,

847
00:47:01,997 --> 00:47:04,506
既然是我要處理生意上的業務 那網站…
And I'm talkin' as the business end of the company, the site...

848
00:47:04,506 --> 00:47:08,045
我們都不知道這到底什麼 我們不知道現在是什麼
We don't even know what it is yet, we don't what it is...

849
00:47:08,175 --> 00:47:08,994
也不知道它會變成什麼
We don't know what it can be.

850
00:47:08,994 --> 00:47:11,438
也不知道未來它會是什麼 我們只知道它很酷
We don't know what it will be. We know that it's cool,

851
00:47:12,657 --> 00:47:14,385
這就是一個無價之寶 我不能放棄這點
That's a priceless asset and I'm not giving it up.

852
00:47:14,385 --> 00:47:16,598
- 所以說不會玩完咯 - 不會玩完
- So it won't be finish? - It won't be finish.

853
00:47:16,598 --> 00:47:18,375
這就是關鍵 時尚的東西永遠不會玩完
That's the point, the way fashion never finish

854
00:47:18,375 --> 00:47:20,394
- 什麼 - 時尚 時尚永遠不會玩完
- What? - Fashion, fashion is never finish.

855
00:47:20,394 --> 00:47:22,261
你在討論時尚 真的嗎 這是你嗎
You talkin' about fashion, really you?

856
00:47:22,261 --> 00:47:24,832
我在說那個想法 我在說它不會玩完
I'm talkin' about the idea I'm sayin' that never finish

857
00:47:24,832 --> 00:47:28,700
好吧 但他們至少用時尚賺錢了 賣賣褲子什麼的
Ok, but they manage to make money, sellin' pants

858
00:47:29,738 --> 00:47:31,160
馬克 這是什麼
Mark what is this?

859
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,680
- 什麼什麼 - 這個
- What? - this.

860
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:35,052
這叫最後通牒 她們叫什麼來著
It's called the cease and desist letter. What were their names?

861
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:36,037
- 誰 - 剛剛的姑娘們
- Who? - The girls.

862
00:47:36,037 --> 00:47:37,182
你什麼時候收到的
When did you get this?

863
00:47:37,182 --> 00:47:39,563
大概10天前 就在我們發佈網站之後
About ten days ago. Right after we launched the site

864
00:47:39,563 --> 00:47:40,580
我的天
***

865
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:41,841
嘿 那倆姑娘 她們叫什麼來著
Hey, the girls what were their names?

866
00:47:41,841 --> 00:47:44,836
上面寫…溫克艾沃斯兄弟說你偷了他們的創意
They're sayin'... the Winklevoss twins are sayin' that you stole their idea.

867
00:47:44,836 --> 00:47:47,164
我覺得這有點小煩人
I find that to be mildly annoying.

868
00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:49,850
他們覺得這是竊取知識產權
They find it to be Intelectual Property Theft.

869
00:47:50,647 --> 00:47:52,116
- 你瞧… - 你為什麼沒那給我看？
- Look... - Why don't you show it to me?

870
00:47:52,116 --> 00:47:53,617
收信人寫的是我
It was addressed to me

871
00:47:53,617 --> 00:47:56,837
上面說我們的Facebook是竊取了迪維亞·納蘭德拉和溫克艾沃斯兄弟的創意
They're sayin' that we stole theFacebook from Divya Narendra and the Winklevoss...

872
00:47:56,837 --> 00:47:58,045
- 我知道上面寫了什麼 - 真的嗎
- I know what it says. - Did we?

873
00:47:58,981 --> 00:48:01,100
- 什麼真的 - 現在別和我打岔
- Did we what? - Don't screw around with me now.

874
00:48:01,133 --> 00:48:02,204
看著我
Look at me

875
00:48:02,204 --> 00:48:03,930
這封信表示我們可能會面臨起訴
The letter says we could face legal action.

876
00:48:03,930 --> 00:48:07,094
- 不 它表示我可能會面臨起訴 - 這封信是律師發來的 馬克
- No, it says I could face legal action - This is from lawyer, Mark.

877
00:48:07,094 --> 00:48:08,312
他們一定是有什麼原因才會…
They must feel they have some grounds for...

878
00:48:08,312 --> 00:48:10,423
那律師是他們爸爸的法律顧問
The lawyer is their father's house counsel.

879
00:48:10,423 --> 00:48:11,281
他們有什麼原因嗎
Do they have grounds?

880
00:48:11,281 --> 00:48:14,259
原因就是我們的東西很酷很流行 而哈佛關係網很爛很俗套
The grounds are our thing is cool and popular and HarvardConnection is lame.

881
00:48:14,259 --> 00:48:17,454
瓦爾多 我沒用他們的代碼 我發誓 我一條都沒用
Wardo, I didn't use any of their code, I promise, I didn't use anything.

882
00:48:17,454 --> 00:48:21,307
不是造了個漂亮的椅子就等於欠了所有造過椅子的人的錢
Look, a guy who builds a really nice chair doesn't owe money to everyone who's ever built a chair.

883
00:48:21,307 --> 00:48:23,468
是的 他們告訴我他們有個想法 但是我有了個更好的想法
Ok, they came to me with an idea. I had a better one.

884
00:48:23,468 --> 00:48:24,429
你為什麼沒給我看這封信
Why didn't you show me this letter

885
00:48:24,429 --> 00:48:25,746
我覺得沒什麼大不了的
I didn't think it was a big deal

886
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:35,473
要是出了什麼事 要是出了隨便什麼事
If there's something wrong, if there's ever anything wrong,

887
00:48:35,724 --> 00:48:36,519
你都能和我說的
You can tell me.

888
00:48:36,519 --> 00:48:38,061
我想幫忙
I'm the guy that wants to help.

889
00:48:38,061 --> 00:48:38,971
這是我們倆的事業
This is our thing.

890
00:48:38,971 --> 00:48:43,325
現在 你還有什麼要告訴我的
Now, is there anything that you need to tell me

891
00:48:43,325 --> 00:48:44,353
沒了
No.

892
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,258
我們該怎麼辦
What are we doing about this?

893
00:48:49,258 --> 00:48:52,621
我去了學生法務中心找了個律師 他跟我說回一封信
I went to a 3-L at Student Legal Services and he told me to write them back.

894
00:48:52,621 --> 00:48:53,688
然後你怎麼說
And what did you say?

895
00:48:53,688 --> 00:48:57,051
我們在一月份見面的時候 我就提及了網站的問題
When we met in January, I express my doubts about the site,

896
00:48:57,051 --> 00:49:00,753
還配了圖表 解釋了多少程序我是沒有參與的
where it stood with graphic, how much programming was left that I had not anticipated...

897
00:49:00,753 --> 00:49:03,389
以及網站運作上硬體的缺失
...the lack of hardware we had to deal with the site use,

898
00:49:03,389 --> 00:49:06,583
還有在發佈網站前缺少推廣
the lack of promotion that we go on to successfully launch the website...

899
00:49:06,583 --> 00:49:10,554
這是你第一次提及這些顧慮 對嗎
This was the first time you raised any of those concern, right?

900
00:49:10,554 --> 00:49:11,865
我之前就提到過
I'd raised concerns before.

901
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:13,827
- 瞎說 不是對我們提 - 先生們
- Bullshit Not to us - Gentlemen.

902
00:49:13,827 --> 00:49:17,655
我在說的是這封信奡ㄗ鴘 一月份的那次見面
I'm talkin about at the meeting in January to which this letter is referring.

903
00:49:17,655 --> 00:49:18,416
對
Yeah.

904
00:49:18,723 --> 00:49:20,235
我重新遣詞造句一下
Let me re-phrase this.

905
00:49:20,992 --> 00:49:25,580
你給我的客戶寫了16封電郵 在前15封中你沒有提到任何顧慮
You sent my client 16 e-mails. In the first 15, you did't raise any concerns

906
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:26,566
這算個問題嗎
Is that a question?

907
00:49:26,566 --> 00:49:30,336
而在第16封 你提到了關於網站性能的問題
In the 16th e-mail you raised concerns about the site functionality.

908
00:49:30,452 --> 00:49:33,106
- 你是否欺騙了他們6個禮拜 - 沒有
- Were you leading them on for six weeks? - No.

909
00:49:33,106 --> 00:49:36,165
之前你為什麼沒有提到任何顧慮
Why didn't you raise any of these concern before?

910
00:49:36,165 --> 00:49:38,200
- 下雨了 - 抱歉？
- It's raining. - I'm sorry?

911
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,469
開始下雨了
It's just started raining.

912
00:49:39,469 --> 00:49:42,546
扎克伯格先生 您在聽我說話嗎
Mr. Zuckerberg, do I have your full attention?

913
00:49:43,626 --> 00:49:44,373
沒
No.

914
00:49:46,008 --> 00:49:47,358
你覺得你該麼
Do you think I deserve it?

915
00:49:47,822 --> 00:49:50,944
- 什麼 - 你覺得你該聽我說話麼
- What? - Do you think I deserve your full attention?

916
00:49:51,978 --> 00:49:55,240
在質證之前我發過誓 我也不想作假證
I had to swear an oath before we began this deposition, and I don't want to perjure myself,

917
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,451
所以我有法律上的義務說不
So I have a legal obligation to say no.

918
00:49:57,451 --> 00:49:58,847
好吧 不
Okay - no.

919
00:49:59,490 --> 00:50:01,128
你覺得自己沒必要聽我說話
You don't think I deserve your attention.

920
00:50:01,128 --> 00:50:04,251
我覺得如果你的客戶們 想坐在我的肩膀上自稱為巨人
I think if your clients want to sit on my shoulders and call themselves tall,

921
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:05,438
他們未嘗不可一試
They have the right to give it a try,

922
00:50:05,438 --> 00:50:08,683
但並不意味著我應該坐在這媗尼A們扯謊
But there's no requirement that I enjoy sitting here listening to people lie.

923
00:50:10,033 --> 00:50:12,502
我可以聽一部分 最小的一部分
You have part of my attention. you have the minimum amount.

924
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:15,796
而我其他的注意力全都回到了 Facebook的辦公室
The rest of my attention is back at the offices of theFacebook,

925
00:50:15,796 --> 00:50:18,225
在那 我的同事和我所做的事情
Where my colleagues and I are doing things that no one in this room,

926
00:50:18,225 --> 00:50:22,205
是這堜狾酗H 特別是你的客戶們在智力上無法勝任的工作
Including and especially your clients, are intellectually or creatively capable of doing.

927
00:50:23,981 --> 00:50:26,499
我是否充分地回答了你紆尊降貴的問題
Did I adequately answer your condescending question?

928
00:50:34,215 --> 00:50:38,261
現在12點45分了 是不是該吃飯去了 
I have 12:45, why don't we say that's lunch.

929
00:50:39,333 --> 00:50:40,623
兩點半回來
Back at 02:30.

930
00:50:41,785 --> 00:50:43,687
她們叫什麼
So what were their names?

931
00:50:45,418 --> 00:50:47,828
她們叫克奡絡扣M愛麗絲
Their names are Christy and Alice.

932
00:50:49,945 --> 00:50:53,232
她們今晚就想喝一杯
And They wanna have drinks tonight

933
00:51:19,709 --> 00:51:21,218
我才不管呢
I don't care.

934
00:51:43,371 --> 00:51:47,336
嘿 兄弟 抱歉 呃 有兩個姑娘在堶掛蓁邥O
Hey man, sorry, uhmm, couple of girls refreshing up in there.

935
00:51:48,684 --> 00:51:49,822
真貼心
Sweet...

936
00:51:54,372 --> 00:51:55,562
我們真是好搭檔
We have groupies.

937
00:52:04,601 --> 00:52:06,883
- 我馬上回來 - 嘿 你要去哪兒
- I'll be right back - Hey, where you goin'?

938
00:52:07,412 --> 00:52:08,100
馬克…
Mark...

939
00:52:12,833 --> 00:52:13,779
艾瑞卡
Erica

940
00:52:16,134 --> 00:52:16,752
嘿
Hey

941
00:52:16,752 --> 00:52:17,714
我看到你從那邊來的
I saw you from over there

942
00:52:17,714 --> 00:52:20,436
- 我都不知道你經常來這家俱樂部 - 是第一次
- I don't know you came to this club a lot. - First time.

943
00:52:20,436 --> 00:52:21,338
我也是
Mine too.

944
00:52:22,076 --> 00:52:23,730
我們能單獨談談麼
Can I talk you alone for a second?

945
00:52:24,901 --> 00:52:26,375
我覺得我就留在這兒好了
I think I'm good right here

946
00:52:26,375 --> 00:52:28,920
只是…我想和你單獨談談
I just... I'd love to talk you alone

947
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:31,323
- 我們能找個地方麼 - 這兒就好了
- *** - Right here is fine

948
00:52:32,583 --> 00:52:34,201
我不知道你有沒有聽說 我新上線的一個網站
I don't know if you heard about this new website I launched.

949
00:52:34,201 --> 00:52:35,911
沒聽說
No.

950
00:52:36,181 --> 00:52:38,777
- 那Facebook呢？ - 你在網上罵我是個婊子 馬克
- TheFacebook? - You called me a bitch on internet, Mark.

951
00:52:38,777 --> 00:52:40,429
所以我想和你談談
That's why, I wanna talk to you...

952
00:52:40,429 --> 00:52:43,108
- 在網上啊 - 如果你能夠 所以我來…
- On the internet... - If you could just...That's why I came over

953
00:52:43,108 --> 00:52:45,080
把女人比作家畜嗎
Comparing women to farm animals?

954
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:46,705
我最終並沒有這麼做
I didn't end up doing that.

955
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:48,382
但你還是寫了這樣的句子
It didn't stop you from writing it.

956
00:52:48,382 --> 00:52:53,521
好像你腦的想法都這麼聰明 不分享倒成了罪過了
As if every thought that tumbles through your head is so clever, it would be a crime for it not to be share.

957
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:57,706
網上的東西可不是能擦掉的 馬克 寫了就永遠擺在那兒了
The internet's not written in pencil, Mark, it's written in ink,

958
00:52:57,706 --> 00:53:00,470
而你說艾瑞卡·奧布萊特是個婊子
And you published that Erica Albright was a bitch.

959
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:05,051
然後又誇誇其談侮辱了我的姓氏 還有我的胸圍尺寸
Right before you made some ignorant crack about my family's name, my bra size...

960
00:53:05,051 --> 00:53:07,279
然後根據女人的熱辣程度 來給她們排名次
And then rated women based on their hotness.

961
00:53:07,738 --> 00:53:10,364
- 艾瑞卡 出了什麼事麼 - 不 沒事
- Erica, is there a problem? - No, there's no problem.

962
00:53:11,573 --> 00:53:15,995
你坐在陰暗的小房間媬堥諤 因為這年頭就流行這麼發洩怒火
You write your snide bullshit from a dark room because that's what the angry do nowadays.

963
00:53:17,029 --> 00:53:19,440
我對你挺好的 別這樣折騰我
I was nice to you don't torture me for it.

964
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,100
如果我們找個地方好好談談…
If we could just go somewhere for a minute...

965
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:23,210
我不想得罪我的朋友
I don't want to be rude to my friends,

966
00:53:23,743 --> 00:53:26,054
- 好吧 - 好吧
- Okay. - Okay.

967
00:53:27,893 --> 00:53:30,007
祝你的遊戲好運
Good luck with your video game.

968
00:53:30,383 --> 00:53:31,303
兄弟 這樣很好
Dude, that's was great...

969
00:53:31,303 --> 00:53:33,732
道歉是件好事 不是麼
That was right thing to do, you apologize, right?

970
00:53:37,001 --> 00:53:39,569
- 我們得擴展 - 什麼 馬克？
- We have to expand. - ***

971
00:53:41,993 --> 00:53:43,331
他生氣了嗎
Is he mad about something?

972
00:53:44,858 --> 00:53:47,135
好的 擴展到耶魯和哥倫比亞大學
Okay, we're expanding to Yale and Columbia.

973
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:48,702
達斯丁 我想讓你和我一起編寫代碼
Dustin, I want you to share the coding work with me.

974
00:53:48,702 --> 00:53:50,872
克奡 你負責公關事務和業務拓展
Chris, you're gonna be in charge of publicity and outreach.

975
00:53:50,872 --> 00:53:53,432
你可以去BU學生報上登一篇文章 作為溝通的橋樑
You can start by gettin' a story in B.U student newspaper. It's the bridge.

976
00:53:53,432 --> 00:53:55,310
他們討厭有關哈佛的報道
They hate doing stories about Harvard.

977
00:53:55,310 --> 00:53:57,402
報紙編輯堛眯w有人是計算機專業的
Somebody at the newspaper will be a computer science major.

978
00:53:57,402 --> 00:54:00,131
告訴他們馬克·扎克伯格願意 給他們寫十個小時的程序
Tell 'em Mark Zuckerberg will do 10 hours of free programming for them.

979
00:54:00,131 --> 00:54:02,050
- 你為什麼要在BU報上登？ - 因為我想
- Why do you want a story in the B.U. newspaper... - Because I do.

980
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:05,085

Dustin's Vice President and Head of Programming and his 5% of the company will come from my end.

克奡筋O公關主任 他的報酬視其業務效果而定
Chris is Director of Publicity and his compensation will depend on the amount of work he ends up doing.

983
00:54:13,688 --> 00:54:15,081
- 還有問題嗎 - 這些姑娘是誰
- Any questions? - Who the girls?

984
00:54:15,441 --> 00:54:17,884
抱歉 呃 她們是克奡絡扣M愛麗絲
Sorry, uhmm... they are Christy and Alice.

985
00:54:17,884 --> 00:54:20,210
- 嗨 - 嗨  你好
- Hi... - Hi. Hello.

986
00:54:21,470 --> 00:54:22,855
我們能幫上忙嗎
Is there anything we can do?

987
00:54:22,855 --> 00:54:23,925
不 就這樣了
No, that's it.

988
00:54:23,925 --> 00:54:25,244
耶魯和哥倫比亞 開始吧
Yale and Columbia, let's go.

989
00:54:25,244 --> 00:54:27,373
- 還有斯坦福 - 什麼
- And Stanford... - What?

990
00:54:27,373 --> 00:54:31,573
斯坦福 該讓身處帕羅奧多的人 也見識下這個了
Standford. It's time for them to see this in Palo Alto.

991
00:54:37,285 --> 00:54:39,383
- 你不吃午飯 - 不了
- You don't want any lunch? - No.

不 謝了
No, thank you.

994
00:54:49,842 --> 00:54:51,281
這對你肯定很艱難
This must be hard.

995
00:54:52,749 --> 00:54:53,599
你是誰
Who are you?

996
00:54:53,938 --> 00:54:57,819
- 我叫瑪麗琳·德爾皮 早上自我介紹過 - 我是說 你是幹什麼的
- I'm Marylin Delpy, I introduced myself this morning. - I mean, what do you do?

我在事務所堣u作了兩年
I'm a second year associate at the firm.

998
00:55:00,245 --> 00:55:03,000
老闆讓我在質證的時候坐在桌子邊
My boss wanted me to sit in on the deposition phase.

999
00:55:04,465 --> 00:55:05,360
你在做什麼
What are you doin'?

1000
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:08,464
看看波斯尼亞的情況如何
Checking in to see how it's going in Bosnia.

1001
00:55:08,851 --> 00:55:09,741
波斯尼亞？
Bosnia?

1002
00:55:10,199 --> 00:55:12,530
他們沒有公路卻有Facebook？
They don't have roads but they have Facebook.

1003
00:55:18,304 --> 00:55:21,648
你一定很討厭溫克艾沃斯家的雙胞胎
You must really hate the Winklevoss.

1004
00:55:21,946 --> 00:55:23,349
我誰也不討厭
I don't hate anybody.

1005
00:55:24,408 --> 00:55:27,698
溫克艾沃斯倆不是因我竊取知識產權而告我
The Winklevii aren't suing me for intellectual property theft.

1006
00:55:27,698 --> 00:55:30,134
他們告我是因為他們人生中第一次
They're suing me because for the first time in their lives,

1007
00:55:30,134 --> 00:55:33,221
事情沒有按照他們想的那樣發展
Things didn't work at the way they were supposed to for them.

1008
00:55:40,498 --> 00:55:42,870
- 他要拓展業務 - 什麼
- He's expanding. - What?

1009
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:46,074
他要把網站拓展到耶魯 哥大和斯坦福 明天這就會出現在校報上
He's expanding to Yale, Columbia and Stanford, it's gonna be in the Crimson tomorrow.

1010
00:55:46,093 --> 00:55:47,349
- 真的嗎 - 對
- Really? - Yeah.

1011
00:55:47,349 --> 00:55:50,563
看來禁止真把他嚇住了哈
Well, it's look like that Cease and desist letter really scared the shit out of him, huh?

1012
00:55:50,563 --> 00:55:53,690
我想請個律師起草一份指令性文件 強迫他關閉網站
I want to hire a lawyer to file for injunctive relief and get this website taken down now!

1013
00:55:53,768 --> 00:55:56,762
這網站存在得越久 "哈佛關係網"就越不值錢
Every minute, the site's up, Harvard Connection become less valuable.

1014
00:55:56,762 --> 00:56:00,657
我要讓他關網站 我要破壞 我要嚴厲的懲罰 我要讓他去死
I want an injunction, I want damages, punitive relief and I want him dead.

1015
00:56:00,657 --> 00:56:01,750
我也一樣
I want those things too!

1016
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:04,770
那為什麼我們什麼都不做 就因為我們是"哈佛紳士"？
Then why aren't we doing anything about it?! Because we're gentlemen of Harvard?!

1017
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:06,115
因為你沒有想過那看起來像什麼
Because you're not thinking about how it's gonna look.

1018
00:56:06,115 --> 00:56:07,231
像什麼
How's it gonna look?

1019
00:56:07,231 --> 00:56:11,160
就像我們穿著骨骼裝追著 小屁孩在高中體育館娷集曊]
Like my brother and I are in skeleton costumes chasing the Karate Kid around a high school gym.

1020
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:14,840
Cam 他已經觸犯了馬薩諸塞州法律
Cam, he violated Massachusetts state law.

1021
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:18,209
如果他拓展到康涅狄格 紐約 加州 那他就會觸犯聯邦法律
When he goes to Connecticut, New York and California he'll have violated federal law.

1022
00:56:18,209 --> 00:56:20,437
同時他還觸犯了哈佛法律
And by the way, he's in violation of Harvard law.

1023
00:56:20,437 --> 00:56:22,021
哪來的什麼哈佛法律
There's no such thing as Harvard law.

1024
00:56:22,021 --> 00:56:25,433
等等 有的
Wait, Yes, there is.

1025
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:30,955
哈佛學生手冊
Harvard student handbook.

1026
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:34,034
新生人手一本 書埵陪茼a方說…
Every freshman is issued one of this. Somewhere in this book says...

1027
00:56:34,034 --> 00:56:35,635
不能偷竊其他學生的東西
You can't steal from another student.

1028
00:56:37,578 --> 00:56:38,565
正是我們需要的
This is what we needed.

1029
00:56:38,565 --> 00:56:39,348
我要去找薩默斯
****

1030
00:56:39,348 --> 00:56:41,659
你沒法見到拉堙P薩默斯
You can't get a meeting with Larry Summers.

1031
00:56:41,749 --> 00:56:45,220
我們兩兄弟交昂貴的學費 績點3.9
My brother and I pay tuition at this school, we carry a 3.9 GPA at this school,

1032
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:48,882
我們給學校贏獎盃 還代表學校參加奧運划艇比賽
We've won trophies for this school and We'll be rowing in the Olympics for this school.

1033
00:56:48,982 --> 00:56:51,542
而我現在要去見這學校的校長
I want a meeting with the goddamn president of this school.

1034
00:56:52,857 --> 00:56:53,818
為什麼要選斯坦福
Why Stanford?

1035
00:56:54,445 --> 00:56:56,088
你以為呢
W- Why do you think?

1036
00:57:00,546 --> 00:57:03,653
不好意思 我的生化課要遲到了
I'm sorry, I'm late for Bio Chem..

1037
00:57:05,017 --> 00:57:05,730
好吧
Okay.

1038
00:57:08,704 --> 00:57:10,460
你還不知道我的名字吧
You don't know my name, do you?

1039
00:57:10,893 --> 00:57:12,404
斯坦福嗎
Is it Stanford?

1040
00:57:12,404 --> 00:57:14,466
我真應該海扁你一頓

Amelia Ritter, but you prefer Amy. You're from Orinda

我說我是個企業家

That's just their own stupidity, I should have been there.

黑暗是因為缺少了光 而他們愚蠢就是因為缺少了我
Darkness is the absence of light and stupidity in that instance was the absence of me.

Well, we came up with an idea for a website called HarvardConnection...

1122
01:01:07,067 --> 01:01:09,336
現在改名叫"聯結你我"
That we've since changed the name to ConnectU,

1123

- 但馬克·扎克伯格剽竊了我們的創意 - 我懂了
- And Mark Zuckerberg stole that idea... - I'm understand.

1124
01:01:12,190 --> 01:01:14,151
我想知道你們要我幹什麼
I'm asking what you want me to do about it?

1125
01:01:14,151 --> 01:01:18,663

Under the heading "Standards of Conduct in the Harvard Community"

1127
01:01:21,375 --> 01:01:23,994
寫道 學校希望所有的學生
It says, The College expects that all students to be honest...

1128
01:01:23,994 --> 01:01:27,247
誠實守信以及行為正直
And forthcoming in their dealings with members in this community.

1129
01:01:27,247 --> 01:01:30,384
要求學生尊重公眾和私人物品
Students are required to respect public and private ownership.

1130
01:01:30,384 --> 01:01:32,323
偷竊行為 侵吞財產或是…
Instances of theft, misappropriation or...

1131
01:01:32,323 --> 01:01:33,800
- 安 - 在
- Ann... - Yes Sir.

1132
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:36,538
打醒我吧 繼續
Punch me in the face... Go ahead.

1133
01:01:38,934 --> 01:01:42,932
或是未授權的盜用都要受處分
Or unauthorized use will result in disciplinary action,

1134
01:01:42,932 --> 01:01:44,990
甚至可能被退學
Including the requirement to withdraw from the College.

1135
01:01:44,990 --> 01:01:47,159
記憶力不錯 然後呢
You memorize that instead of doing, what?

1136
01:01:47,234 --> 01:01:51,020
我們兩兄弟今天來 是想問問您…
What my brother and I come, here today, to ask you, respectfully of course...

1137
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:53,815
竊取其他學生的成果是違反校規的 就這麼簡單
Sir, it's against University rules to steal from another student, plain and simple.

1138
01:01:53,815 --> 01:01:55,216
你和你們的宿管談過了？
You've spoken to your House-master.

1139
01:01:55,216 --> 01:01:59,597
是的 先生 宿管讓我們找行政委員會 但行政委員會不睬我們
Yes Sir, and the House-master made a recommendation to the Ad Board but the Ad Board won't hear us.

1140
01:01:59,597 --> 01:02:01,240
你們有沒有直接和那個學生談過
Have you tried dealing with the other student directly?

1141
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:05,252
扎克伯格先生過去兩周都沒有回復過我們的任何郵件或電話
Mr. Zuckerberg hasn't been responding to any of our e-mails or phone calls for the last two weeks.

1142
01:02:05,252 --> 01:02:07,454
我們去敲他宿舍的門他都不應
He doesn't answer when we knock on his door at Kirkland.

1143
01:02:07,454 --> 01:02:10,490
我最近一次當面見到他還是在庭院
And the closest I've come to dealing with him face to face is when I saw him on the quad,

1144
01:02:10,490 --> 01:02:11,884
然後我追著他跑了整個哈佛操場
And I chased him through Harvard Square.

1145
01:02:11,884 --> 01:02:12,519
你追逐他？
You chased him?

1146
01:02:12,519 --> 01:02:15,790
我看見他了 而且我知道他也看見我了 然後過了幾分鐘他就消失了
I- I saw him and I know he saw me and after a minutes he disappeared.

1147
01:02:16,090 --> 01:02:18,142
我不覺得這是學校的事
I don't see this as the university issue.

1148
01:02:18,142 --> 01:02:19,978
這顯然是學校的事
Of course this is a university issue.

1149
01:02:19,978 --> 01:02:21,882
學校有關於道德和榮譽的準則 而他將兩者都打破了
There's a code of ethics and an honor code and he violated them both.

1150
01:02:21,882 --> 01:02:26,049
你們和學校之間有道德契約 但彼此間沒有
You entered into a code of ethics with the university, not with each other.

1151
01:02:26,285 --> 01:02:29,973
很抱歉Summers校長 你說的完全沒道理
I'm sorry President Summers, but what you just said makes no sense to me at all.

1152
01:02:29,973 --> 01:02:31,093
我很震驚
I'm devastated by that.

1153
01:02:31,093 --> 01:02:33,787
我弟弟是想說 如果馬克·扎克伯格闖進了我們宿舍
What my brother means is if Mark Zuckerberg breaking into our dorm room

1154
01:02:33,787 --> 01:02:36,224
偷走了我們的電腦 那就是學校的事了
And stole our computer, that would be university issue.

1155
01:02:36,224 --> 01:02:38,476
我不知道校長辦公室還要管小偷竊
I don't know this office doesn't handle petty larceny.

1156
01:02:38,476 --> 01:02:42,136
這不是小偷竊 這是價值百萬美金的創意
This isn't petty larceny. This idea potentially worth millions of dollars.

1157
01:02:42,154 --> 01:02:43,214
- 百萬美金 - 對
- Millions? - Yes.

1158
01:02:43,214 --> 01:02:45,617
你們想像力太豐富了
You might just be letting your imaginations run away with you.

1159
01:02:45,617 --> 01:02:48,855
先生 我不覺得你有資格這樣說
Sir, I actually don't think you're in any position to make that call.

1160
01:02:48,855 --> 01:02:52,916
我是美國財政秘書 我有資格這樣說
I was the U.S. Treasury Secretary, I'm in some position to make that call

1161
01:02:52,916 --> 01:02:57,094
讓我們充分發揮想像力正是你在新生入學典禮演講時說的啊
Letting our imaginations run away with us is exactly what we were told us to do in your freshmen address.

1162
01:02:57,094 --> 01:03:01,342
我建議你們在想新項目時發揮想像力
I would suggest that you let your imaginations run away with you on a new project.

1163
01:03:01,342 --> 01:03:04,264
- 是嗎 - 當然 哈佛堥C個人都在發明新東西
- You would? - Yes, everyone at Harvard is eventing something.

1164
01:03:04,264 --> 01:03:08,886
哈佛的本科生相信創造工作比找工作更好
Harvard Undergraduates believe that inventing a job is better than finding a job.

1165
01:03:08,886 --> 01:03:12,689
所以我再次建議你們倆想個新項目
So I suggest again that the two of you come up with a new, new project.

1166
01:03:12,689 --> 01:03:14,132
不好意思 但那不是重點 先生
I'm sorry, but that's not the point, Sir.

1167
01:03:14,132 --> 01:03:15,817
那重點是什麼
Please what's the point.

1168
01:03:15,817 --> 01:03:19,453
要辨別是非不需要是這方面的專家
You don't have to be an intellectual property expert to understand the difference between right and wrong.

1169
01:03:19,453 --> 01:03:20,754
你是說我不能辨別是非
And you're saying that I don't.

1170
01:03:20,754 --> 01:03:22,291
我絕無此意
Of course I'm not saying that.

1171
01:03:22,291 --> 01:03:23,377
我正有此意
I'm saying that.

1172
01:03:23,377 --> 01:03:24,854
- 是嗎 - 先生
- Really? - Sir...

1173
01:03:24,854 --> 01:03:27,013
安 他們怎麼得到預約的
Ann... How do they get this appointment?

1174
01:03:27,013 --> 01:03:28,566
他們父親的同事
Colleagues of their father...

1175
01:03:30,633 --> 01:03:35,071
我來說清楚 兩位溫克艾沃斯先生 既然你們要討論是非
Let me tell you something Mr. Winklevoss, Mr. Winklevoss, since you under subject of right and wrong.

1176
01:03:35,539 --> 01:03:39,918
你們這種行為 到這堥茖ㄖ痟N是錯的
This action, this meeting, the two of you being here is wrong.

1177
01:03:39,918 --> 01:03:43,288
這不是哈佛學生該做的事 也不是哈佛的精神
Is not worthy of Harvard, Is not what Harvard saw in you...

1178
01:03:43,288 --> 01:03:45,816
沒有特殊對待
You don't get special treatment!

1179
01:03:45,816 --> 01:03:46,632
我們沒有要求特殊對待
We never ask for it...

1180
01:03:46,632 --> 01:03:50,445
只是想新項目嗎 就像科研課上做模型一樣？
Just start another project? Like we're making a diorama for the science fair?

1181
01:03:50,445 --> 01:03:53,514
- 如果你有什麼問題 溫克艾沃斯先生 - 我們從沒要求特殊對待
- If you have problems with that Mr. Winklevoss - We never ask for special treatment.

1182
01:03:53,514 --> 01:03:55,300
法庭隨時向你們敞開
The court are always at your disposal...

1183
01:03:55,874 --> 01:03:57,229
還有什麼我能幫到你們的嗎
Is there anything else, I could do for you?

1184
01:03:57,230 --> 01:03:59,726
- !@#$%^&… - 閉嘴
- *** - *****

1185
01:04:00,483 --> 01:04:01,918
感謝您抽出寶貴的時間 先生
Thank you very much for your time, Sir.

1186
01:04:07,967 --> 01:04:11,277
哎呀 弄壞了你們335年歷史的門把手
Ups, broke 335 years old your door knob.

1187
01:04:13,547 --> 01:04:16,517
愛德華多 春假期間 你和扎克伯格先生去了趟紐約
Eduardo, spring break, you and Mr. Zuckerberg took a trip to New York.

1188
01:04:16,517 --> 01:04:18,662
- 對 - 此行的目的是什麼
- yes. - What was the purpose of the trip?

1189
01:04:19,254 --> 01:04:23,777
作為財務總監 我要去和潛在廣告商洽談
Well, as CFO, I'd set up some meetings with potential advertisers.

1190
01:04:23,836 --> 01:04:24,779
你們去是誰出的錢
Who paid for the trip?

1191
01:04:24,779 --> 01:04:27,918
來自我幾個月前存的一千美金
It was paid for out of the thousand dollar account I'd set up a few months earlier.

1192
01:04:27,918 --> 01:04:32,027
在那時你的一千美金是公司唯一資金
At this point your thousand dollars was the only money that had been put into the company.

1193
01:04:32,027 --> 01:04:34,149
- 對 - 洽談進行得如何
- Yes. - How did you feel the meetings went?

1194
01:04:35,419 --> 01:04:37,208
- 很糟糕 - 為什麼
- It went terribly. - Why?

1195
01:04:37,618 --> 01:04:40,245
- 馬克睡著了 - 我沒睡著
- Mark was asleep. - I was not asleep.

1196
01:04:40,587 --> 01:04:41,859
我能重新說一遍嗎
Can I re-phrase my answer?

1197
01:04:41,859 --> 01:04:44,193
我倒是希望他睡了
I wish he'd been asleep.

1198
01:04:46,864 --> 01:04:50,784
我們現在覆蓋29個學校 有75000多個會員
So we're at 29 schools now with over 75.000 members.

1199
01:04:51,209 --> 01:04:54,863
人們上the Facebook的時間比其他網站都長
People who go on theFacebook tend to stay on longer than almost any other website.

1200
01:04:54,863 --> 01:04:59,734
最驚人的數據是 61%初始用戶都會成為回頭客
Now here's the most impressive statistic, 61% of people who try it once, will come back...

1201
01:04:59,734 --> 01:05:01,752
- 如果你能讓我… - 抱歉 等一下
- Now if you'll allow me... - Excuse me, one second...

1202
01:05:01,752 --> 01:05:04,556
他發出的是什麼聲音 是"切"嗎
What sound that he's making? Is that like a tsk...

1203
01:05:07,095 --> 01:05:10,775
不是"切" 是…
It wasn't tsk...

1204
01:05:11,138 --> 01:05:12,801
像火雞叫
Like a glottal stop.

1205
01:05:13,427 --> 01:05:15,474
喉嚨塞住了似的
Almost a gag reflex.

1206
01:05:16,956 --> 01:05:18,269
你們這是什麼意思
Guys, what is this?

1207
01:05:18,911 --> 01:05:21,355
紐約之行還有一次會面
There was one more meeting scheduled for the New York trip.

1208
01:05:21,355 --> 01:05:22,727
對 是頓晚餐
Yes, it was a dinner.

1209
01:05:22,727 --> 01:05:24,469
那時是我女朋友安排的
It was set up through my girlfriend at the time.

1210
01:05:24,469 --> 01:05:27,113
你覺得馬克對這次會面很期待嗎
Would you say that Mark was excited about this meeting?

1211
01:05:27,698 --> 01:05:30,225
是的 十分期待
Yes, very.

1212
01:05:30,225 --> 01:05:32,168
- 他們不會把我們丟出去的 - 說不定呢
- Look, they're not gonna card us... - They might.

1213
01:05:32,168 --> 01:05:33,920
- 看看四周 - 這很尷尬
- I mean look around. - It'll be embarrassing.

1214
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:35,807
告訴他我們不會被丟出去
Tell him they're not gonna card us.

1215
01:05:35,998 --> 01:05:37,384
- 他們不會丟我們出去 - 馬克
- They're not gonna card us. - Mark...

1216
01:05:37,384 --> 01:05:39,111
你又想說廣告的事嗎
Are you gonna talk about ads again?

1217
01:05:39,111 --> 01:05:42,797
除非是想做哈特福德芭蕾劇場 不然做生意就是要盈利的
Unless you're the Ballet Theatre of Hartford, the purpose of a business is to make a profit.

1218
01:05:42,797 --> 01:05:44,107
這還不是生意
This isn't a business, yet.

1219
01:05:44,107 --> 01:05:48,452
那我怎麼辦 我的工作就是…算了
That's tough for me because my job... Nevermind.

1220
01:05:50,977 --> 01:05:52,472
他晚了25分鐘
He's 25 mins late.

1221
01:05:52,472 --> 01:05:55,061
他19歲就創辦了Napster 他可以放人鴿子
He founded Napster when he was 19, he can be late.

1222
01:05:55,061 --> 01:05:56,920
- 他又不是神 - 那他是什麼
- He's not a God. - Then what is he?

1223
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:58,638
他是遲到25分鐘的人
He's 25 minutes late.

1224
01:05:58,638 --> 01:05:59,708
我覺得瓦爾多嫉妒了
I think Wardo's jealous.

1225
01:05:59,708 --> 01:06:03,272
我絕對不是在嫉妒 我是緊張
I honestly wasn't jealous. I was nervous.

1226
01:06:03,471 --> 01:06:04,324
為什麼
Why?

1227
01:06:04,324 --> 01:06:07,911
我完全不認識他 但我據我的瞭解
I didn't know him at all but I had done a search and asked around...

1228
01:06:07,911 --> 01:06:14,708
他給我的印象是個很麻煩的人
He struck me as kind of a wild card.

1229
01:06:14,919 --> 01:06:15,565
為什麼
Why?

1230
01:06:15,565 --> 01:06:19,276
他整垮了兩家很牛的互聯網公司
He crashed out of two pretty big internet companies in spectacular fashion,

1231
01:06:19,276 --> 01:06:22,069
- 他還是個癮君子 - 但那些公司也是他創辦的
- He's had a reputation with drugs. - He also founded the companies.

1232
01:06:22,069 --> 01:06:23,871
我們不需要他
We don't need him.

1233
01:06:24,868 --> 01:06:25,605
他來了
He's here.

1234
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:30,084
不不 沒事 吃你們的
No, no, take your time.

1235
01:06:30,084 --> 01:06:31,945
他戴表了
And he does own a watch.

1236
01:06:31,945 --> 01:06:33,014
別說了
Stop it.

1237
01:06:34,566 --> 01:06:35,893
- 我是肖恩·帕克 - 你好
- I'm Sean Parker. - How do you do.

1238
01:06:35,893 --> 01:06:39,356
你們一定是愛德華多 克奡絡扣M馬克 見到你們真高興
You must be Eduardo and Christy and Mark, great to meet you.

1239
01:06:39,356 --> 01:06:40,541
見到你很高興
Great to meet you.

1240
01:06:41,099 --> 01:06:42,900
你們還沒點東西吃呢
You guys don't have anything in front of you.

1241
01:06:43,154 --> 01:06:44,775
- 托 - 我們一直在等…
- Tori... - We were waiting...

1242
01:06:44,775 --> 01:06:46,976
- 行了 - 你能不能給我們來點
- Hey baby boy. - Could you bring out some things?

1243
01:06:46,976 --> 01:06:51,972
帶薑汁的豬肉 金槍魚 還有龍蝦之類的開胃菜
The lacquered pork with that ginger confit, tuna tartar, and the lobster claws, that'll get us started.

1244
01:06:51,972 --> 01:06:54,425
克奡絡 想喝點什麼
Christy what do you like to drink?

1245
01:06:55,569 --> 01:06:56,736
蘋果馬蒂尼
An appletini

1246
01:06:56,736 --> 01:06:58,962
不錯 來四杯吧
Great. Four of those.

1247
01:06:59,704 --> 01:07:01,998
那之後就是他的個人秀了
From that point on it was a Sean-a-thon.

1248
01:07:11,075 --> 01:07:13,694
問題在於你們談了什麼
The question was what did you talk about?

1249
01:07:25,492 --> 01:07:27,445
他滔滔不絕地說Napster
He took us through his episode with Napster.

1250
01:07:27,445 --> 01:07:30,641
我不想把我的二十歲年華浪費在辯護上
I didn't want to spend my twenty as a professional defendant

1251
01:07:30,641 --> 01:07:33,402
誰知道音樂行業沒點幽默感
Who knew the music industry doesn't have a sense of humor.

1252
01:07:33,964 --> 01:07:37,256
我們打算賣掉公司來償還 欠他們所謂的三千五百萬版稅
We tried to sell the company to pay the 35 millions they said we owed in royalties,

1253
01:07:37,256 --> 01:07:42,427
不過我想對他們來說 這有點像用偷來的卡付偷來的汽油的錢
But I guess to them that was a little like selling a stolen card to pay for the stolen gas.

1254
01:07:42,451 --> 01:07:44,899
所以我們就說 去你媽的 然後就宣佈了破產
So we said, screw it, we declare bankruptcy.

1255
01:07:44,899 --> 01:07:47,714
- 你一舉成名了 - 而你的飲料喝完了
- You made a name for yourself. - And you are dry.

1256
01:07:47,714 --> 01:07:49,200
- 托 - 不 不用了
- Tory... - No, no, I'm good.

1257
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:53,515
然後他又開始講他第二次冒險 網絡通訊錄
And then he went to his second business venture which was an online rolodex.

1258
01:07:53,515 --> 01:07:55,775
他被"追逐平等"網站給踢出來了
which was an online Rolodex that he got thrown out of by Case Equity.

1259
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:59,732
這次我想 要好好幹 我繫了領帶 把皮鞋擦得珵亮
And I want to do it nice this time, I put on a tie, i shine my shoes.

1260
01:07:59,732 --> 01:08:01,717
但沒人願意接小孩子的訂單
But nobody want to take orders from a kid.

1261
01:08:01,717 --> 01:08:04,849
讓我告訴你們接下來發生了什麼
So let me tell you what happen...

1262
01:08:04,849 --> 01:08:07,934
- 我不是精神科醫生 但是… - 我知道你不是
- I'm not psychiatrist, but - I'm glad with got that on record.

1263
01:08:07,934 --> 01:08:09,935
你不是精神科醫生 然後呢
You're not a psychiatrist, but what...

1264
01:08:09,935 --> 01:08:12,980
精神科醫生會說他得了妄想癥
A psychiatrist would say that he was paranoid.

1265
01:08:12,980 --> 01:08:15,750
他們請了私人偵探 日夜跟蹤我
They hire private detectives, who follow you day and night.

1266
01:08:15,750 --> 01:08:18,280
你是專業偵探的目標
You are target for hi press-escort.

1267
01:08:18,412 --> 01:08:20,241
我沒有證據 但我知道他們竊聽了我的電話
I can't prove it but I know they tap my phone.

1268
01:08:20,241 --> 01:08:22,944
只要能找到任何整垮我的證據
Whatever it is that's gonna trip you up, you're done already.

1269
01:08:22,944 --> 01:08:25,480
隨著時間推移 做事要越來越小心
Private behaviour is really cover time gone by...

1270
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:28,784
然後不知怎麼的 你就過上了達賴喇嘛一樣的生活
And then somehow and someway you've manage to live your life like a Dalai lama

1271
01:08:28,784 --> 01:08:29,771
別搞錯了
Don't mixed it up.

1272
01:08:29,771 --> 01:08:32,740
他們想要的不是你 是你的創意
Because they don't want you, they want your idea.

1273
01:08:32,740 --> 01:08:34,911
而且他們想讓你說謝謝
And they want you to say thank you while you,

1274
01:08:34,933 --> 01:08:37,437
就是…在被他們扇了一耳光之後
Excuse me... wipe your chin and walk away.

1275
01:08:37,437 --> 01:08:38,679
這是發生在你身上的事？
That's what happen to you?

1276
01:08:38,679 --> 01:08:40,416
絕對的妄想
And delusional.

1277
01:08:40,795 --> 01:08:41,749
對
Yes,

1278
01:08:41,749 --> 01:08:43,303
但 他們總有一天要還的
But... they'll be pay back.

1279
01:08:43,303 --> 01:08:47,290
我曾經用Napster打垮唱片公司 這次也是一樣
In case I brought down the record company with Napster and I left the company since then too.

1280
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:50,889
抱歉 你沒有整垮唱片公司 是他們贏了
Sorry, you didn't bring down the record companies. They won.

1281
01:08:50,889 --> 01:08:52,621
- 在法庭上 - 對
- In court. - Yeah.

1282
01:08:53,114 --> 01:08:55,442
你現在還想買唱片嗎 愛德華多
You wanna buy a Tower record, Eduardo?

1283
01:08:58,461 --> 01:09:02,017
然後他不停地說他在硅谷的生活
And he told story after story about life in Silicon Valley,

1284
01:09:02,017 --> 01:09:05,836
斯坦福的派對 還有在洛杉磯的百萬富翁朋友
Parties at Stanford and down in LA, friends who'd become millionaires,

1285
01:09:05,836 --> 01:09:11,234
不過主要是為什麼馬克一定要… 一定要去加州
But mostly how Mark had to, he had to come to California.

1286
01:09:11,234 --> 01:09:13,844
然後他終於說到the Facebook
And then he cut around to theFacebook.

1287
01:09:13,844 --> 01:09:16,230
跟我說說你們的進展吧
So tell me about your progress.

1288
01:09:16,230 --> 01:09:20,618
我們覆蓋了29所大學 已經有75000多個會員
Well, we're in 29 schools now, we got over 75 thousands members...

1289
01:09:20,618 --> 01:09:21,619
說說你們的戰略
Tell me about the strategy.

1290
01:09:21,619 --> 01:09:26,040
好吧 比如 我們想入駐德州的貝勒大學 但貝勒大學已經有了一個校園社交網絡
Ok, for instance, we wanted Baylor in Texas but Baylor already had a social network on campus

1291
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:29,985
所以我們並不直接去找他們 而是列出了他們周圍所有學校
So instead of going right after them, we made a list of every school within a hundred miles

1292
01:09:29,985 --> 01:09:31,445
然後先讓the Facebook入駐這些校園
And put theFacebook on those campuses first.

1293
01:09:31,445 --> 01:09:33,337
不久之後所有貝勒大學的學生就會在我們的網站上找到他們的朋友
Pretty soon all the Baylor kids were seeing their friends on our site.

1294
01:09:33,337 --> 01:09:34,699
- 我們就成功入駐了 - 小餌釣大魚
- We were in. - Its called a little bait for a big one.

1295
01:09:34,699 --> 01:09:36,194
- 很聰明啊 馬克 - 謝謝 那是我的主意
- That's smart, Mark. - Thanks that's was mine.

1296
01:09:36,194 --> 01:09:36,833
放鬆點
Easy.

1297
01:09:36,833 --> 01:09:38,485
不如你來說說看
Hey you know what, settle an argument for us,

1298
01:09:38,485 --> 01:09:40,938
我覺得the Facebook是時候開始盈利了
I say it's time to start making money from theFacebook

1299
01:09:40,938 --> 01:09:43,310
但馬克不想要廣告 你覺得誰對
But Mark doesn't want advertising. Who's right?

1300
01:09:44,770 --> 01:09:46,113
你們都不對
Neither of you yet.

1301
01:09:46,113 --> 01:09:47,450
the Facebook很酷
TheFacebook is cool,

1302
01:09:47,450 --> 01:09:49,010
- 這應該長久保持 - 對
- That's what it's got going for it. - Yeah.

1303
01:09:49,010 --> 01:09:50,271
你想用廣告毀了它
You don't want to ruin it with ads

1304
01:09:50,271 --> 01:09:51,764
- 因為廣告不酷 - 正是
- Because ads aren't cool. - Exactly.

1305
01:09:51,764 --> 01:09:53,712
這就像你們在校園媟d一場盛大的派對
It's like you're throwing the greatest party on campus.

1306
01:09:53,712 --> 01:09:55,654
但有人說 十一點必須結束
And someone's saying, it's gotta be over by 11:00.

1307
01:09:55,654 --> 01:09:56,604
正是如此
That's exactly right.

1308
01:09:56,604 --> 01:09:58,490
你們還不知道這到底是什麼呢
You don't even know what the thing is yet.

1309
01:09:58,490 --> 01:10:00,542
能做多大 能走多遠
How big it can get and how far it can go.

1310
01:10:00,542 --> 01:10:02,726
這還不該是停手的時候
This is no time to take your chips down.

1311
01:10:02,726 --> 01:10:04,613
一百萬美元不夠酷 你們知道什麼才叫酷嗎
A million dollars isn't cool. You know what's cool?

1312
01:10:04,613 --> 01:10:05,514
你？
You?

1313
01:10:08,257 --> 01:10:10,726
十億美元
A billion dollars.

1314
01:10:13,461 --> 01:10:15,137
然後大家就都安靜了
And that shut everybody up.

1315
01:10:15,137 --> 01:10:18,543
這才是你們的目標 十億美金的價值
And that's where you're headed. A billion dollar valuation.

1316
01:10:19,405 --> 01:10:24,064
除非你們聽了壞建議 雖然那樣你們仍能做成功的連鎖酸奶店
Unless you take bad advice in which case you might as well come up with a chain of very successful yogurt shop.

1317
01:10:24,068 --> 01:10:27,879
去釣魚時 你可以釣很多小魚 也可以只釣一隻大魚
When you go fishing you can catch a lot of fish or you can catch a big fish.

1318
01:10:27,930 --> 01:10:31,043
你會走進一個人房間 看到他和14磅鱒魚的合影嗎
You ever walk into a guy's den and see a picture of him standing next to fourteen trout?

1319
01:10:31,043 --> 01:10:32,670
不 他一定是抱著3000磅的槍魚
No he's holding an 3000 pound marlin.

1320
01:10:32,670 --> 01:10:33,970
- 對 - 好比喻
- Yup. - That's a good announce.

1321
01:10:33,970 --> 01:10:36,956
但我們都知道槍魚不可能有3000磅重不是嗎
But we all know, that marlin won't weight 3000 pounds, right?

1322
01:10:36,956 --> 01:10:38,408
- 我見過差不多那麼大的 - 我從沒見過
- I've seen a big one at close - No, I haven't.

1323
01:10:38,408 --> 01:10:40,895
但那傢伙要抱著像路虎那麼大的魚
But I don't think the guy holdings a marlin at size of a range rover.

1324
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:43,716
那得是多大的魚 多壯的人啊
That would really big fish or a very strong guy.

1325
01:10:43,716 --> 01:10:45,294
你沒搞清楚重點吧
You think I might be getting away from the point?

1326
01:10:45,294 --> 01:10:47,102
我不是來惹麻煩的
I don't have a dog in this fight.

1327
01:10:47,102 --> 01:10:49,296
我只是個粉絲 過來打聲招呼
I'm just a fan who came to say hi.

1328
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:52,039
他那晚之後就完全抓住了馬克的心
He owned Mark after that dinner.

1329
01:10:52,587 --> 01:10:56,001
他告訴馬克很快會再談 拿起賬單 然後就走了
He picked up the check, He told Mark they'd talk again soon and he was gone.

1330
01:10:56,001 --> 01:10:59,980
不過臨走他還做了對公司的一次重大貢獻
But not before he made his biggest contribution to the company.

1331
01:11:02,291 --> 01:11:05,435
把"the"去掉 只留Facebook
Drop the "the". Just Facebook.

1332
01:11:05,435 --> 01:11:06,287
更簡潔
It's cleaner.

1333
01:11:09,931 --> 01:11:10,956
靠
Shit.

1334
01:11:21,033 --> 01:11:24,031
那都可以破說話速度的世界紀錄了
That's gotta be some kind of land speed record for talking.

1335
01:11:24,031 --> 01:11:25,557
你想讓派對在十一點結束嗎
You want to end the party at eleven?

1336
01:11:27,010 --> 01:11:27,972
我要為派對付錢
I'm trying to pay for the party.

1337
01:11:27,972 --> 01:11:30,290
如果不酷的話就根本不叫派對了
There won't be a party unless it's cool.

1338
01:11:31,576 --> 01:11:32,600
你覺得呢
What'd you think?

1339
01:11:33,101 --> 01:11:34,461
是啊 好吧 把"the"去掉
Yes, sure, let's drop the "the"

1340
01:11:34,461 --> 01:11:39,199
我是說丟掉14磅鱒魚 去抓槍魚 這聽起來不是很棒嗎
I meant catching the marlin instead of the 14 trouts. Doesn't that sound good?

1341
01:11:39,199 --> 01:11:40,432
鱒魚才這麼覺得
If you're a trout.

1342
01:11:41,222 --> 01:11:42,661
我要把這些加入記錄
I'm going to enter this into the record.

1343
01:11:42,661 --> 01:11:46,631
Facebook的合併文件 以及在佛羅里達註冊的有限公司
Incorporation papers for Facebook, and LLC registered in Florida,

1344
01:11:46,631 --> 01:11:48,641
- 為什麼在佛羅里達註冊 - 我家在那
- Why Florida? - That's where my family lives.

1345
01:11:48,641 --> 01:11:52,762
文件中對合併後股權分配說明如下
And ask the respondent to stipulate that the documents of incorporation state the ownership as follows,

1346
01:11:52,762 --> 01:11:55,031
65%歸馬克·扎克伯格所有
Sixty-five percent for Mark Zuckerberg,

1347
01:11:55,031 --> 01:11:58,534
30%歸愛德華多·薩佛林 5%歸屬達斯丁·莫斯克維茨
30 percent for Eduardo Saverin and 5 percent for Dustin Moskowitz.

1348
01:11:58,534 --> 01:12:01,779
- 是做出了規定 - 是在2004年4月13日簽的
- We stipulate. - And that was April 13th 2004.

1349
01:12:01,779 --> 01:12:02,733
你可以標一下
You can mark it.

1350
01:12:02,733 --> 01:12:03,849
還有什麼問題嗎
Do you have anything here?

1351
01:12:03,849 --> 01:12:06,828
是的 謝謝 薩佛林先生
Yes, thank you. Mr. Saverin,

1352
01:12:06,828 --> 01:12:11,817
你做過什麼可以合法終止合同的事嗎
Have you ever done anything that might be considered legitimate ground for termination?

1353
01:12:13,269 --> 01:12:13,944
沒有
No.

1354
01:12:13,944 --> 01:12:18,441
你從沒做過使公司名譽受損 或者危及公司的事嗎
You never did anything to embarrass the company or even seriously jeopardize it?

1355
01:12:19,181 --> 01:12:19,924
沒有
No.

1356
01:12:19,924 --> 01:12:20,867
沒有？
No?

1357
01:12:24,583 --> 01:12:27,391
- 沒有 - 你曾經被控虐待動物
- No. - You were accused of animal cruelty.

1358
01:12:29,141 --> 01:12:30,151
等一下
Wait.

1359
01:12:30,952 --> 01:12:33,509
- 你沒有嗎 - 這…這不是事實
- You weren't? - T- this not happening.

1360
01:12:33,509 --> 01:12:35,775
我這有篇校報的報道
I have here an article from The Crimson...

1361
01:12:35,775 --> 01:12:37,904
上帝啊
Jesus Christ...

1362
01:12:37,904 --> 01:12:38,898
我完全不能接受 瓦爾多
I can't have this, Wardo.

1363
01:12:38,898 --> 01:12:42,676
拜託 這是狗屎 這只是社團的惡作劇
Come on, man this is bullshit, this is another clubs playing a prank.

1364
01:12:43,736 --> 01:12:48,165
我即將加入鳳凰社 而作為加入的考驗
I'd gotten into the Phoenix. I'd been accepted and as part of my initiation,

1365
01:12:48,165 --> 01:12:52,528
我必須一整個星期隨身攜帶並照顧一隻雞
I had to, for one week, carry with me all the times and take care of a chicken.

1366
01:12:52,528 --> 01:12:56,949
他們將你作為the Facebook創始人之一 "小愛德華多·薩佛林"
They identify you as one of the founders of theFacebook, "Junior Eduardo Saverin,"

1367
01:12:57,074 --> 01:13:00,412
我雖然不是專家 但也知道被扯上虐待動物對我們的事業不利
I'm not the expert but being connected to torturing animals is probably bad for business.

1368
01:13:00,412 --> 01:13:05,313
我沒有虐待那隻雞 我不虐雞 你們瘋了嗎
I did not torture the chicken, I don't torture chickens, are you crazy?

1369
01:13:05,313 --> 01:13:07,150
不 冷靜點
No, and settle down, please.

1370
01:13:07,150 --> 01:13:09,259
我這埵魚g校報的報道
I have here, an article from The Crimson...

1371
01:13:09,376 --> 01:13:11,138
- 這真尖刻 - 956
- This is scathing. - Nine-hundred-fifty-six.

1372
01:13:11,138 --> 01:13:14,300
我當時和馬克在宿舍食堂吃飯
I was having dinner in the Kirkland Dining Hall with Mark,

1373
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:19,263
我帶著那隻雞是因為我必須時刻帶著它 這就是大學生活
And I had the chicken with me because I had to have the chicken with me at all times. This was college.

1374
01:13:19,263 --> 01:13:20,723
總得有人出來澄清一下啊
Somebody gonna have to answer for this.

1375
01:13:20,723 --> 01:13:21,633
九百六十九
Nine-hundred-sixty-nine.

1376
01:13:21,633 --> 01:13:25,563
食堂用雞做菜 而我要餵我的雞
Dining hall was serving chicken for dinner and I had to feed my chicken.

1377
01:13:25,563 --> 01:13:30,034
所以我只好餵了點雞肉給雞吃
So I took... Little pieces of chicken and gave it to the chicken.

1378
01:13:30,101 --> 01:13:34,038
肯定是有人看見了 因為我接下來就被指控逼迫同類相食了
Someone must have seen me because the next thing I knew I was being accused of forced cannibalism.

1379
01:13:34,629 --> 01:13:39,435
我不知道這是不允許的 我和好多動物權益組織聯繫過
I didn't know you could't do that. I dealt with the various animal rights groups,

1380
01:13:39,435 --> 01:13:43,940
我也和聯合院長討論過 問題都解決了
I dealt with the Associate Dean of the College, this was all resolved.

1381
01:13:43,940 --> 01:13:45,104
九百八十八
Nine-hundred-eighty-eight.

1382
01:13:45,104 --> 01:13:47,379
肯定是坡客或福萊的人打了小報告
Someone from the Porc or the Fly must have reported it.

1383
01:13:47,379 --> 01:13:48,963
我覺得肯定是溫克艾沃斯
For all I know it was the Winklevoss...

1384
01:13:48,963 --> 01:13:50,867
好吧 忘掉它吧
Alright, let's just forget about it.

1385
01:13:50,867 --> 01:13:55,513
這太可笑了 我被指控虐待動物 還不如被指控成戀屍癖呢
This is absurd, I'm being accused of animal cruelty. Better to be accused of Necrophilia.

1386
01:13:55,513 --> 01:13:57,139
確實還不如被指控戀屍癖啊
It is better to be accused of Necrophilia.

1387
01:13:57,139 --> 01:13:58,465
我得向我父親解釋這件事
I have to explain this to my father,

1388
01:13:58,465 --> 01:14:02,244
我得向所有人解釋這件事 我要…你在幹什麼
I'm gonna explain this to everybody, I'm gonna... what is happening on that?

1389
01:14:02,244 --> 01:14:04,397
我的"戰後時期及當代藝術"馬上要期末考
I have my final coming up for "Postwar and Contemporary Art".

1390
01:14:04,397 --> 01:14:07,175
我還沒去上過課呢 我要寫關於這四幅畫的論文
And I haven't been to class. I'm supposed to write about those four paintings.

1391
01:14:07,175 --> 01:14:08,295
那是個Facebook的頁面嗎
Is that a facebook page?

1392
01:14:08,295 --> 01:14:11,425
對 我用馬甲把畫傳上去 然後讓大家在下面評論
Yeah, I opened it under an alias. I posted the paintings and asked people to comment.

1393
01:14:11,425 --> 01:14:14,409
時不時我再上去攪和一下 保持討論氣氛
Every once in a while, I hop on and stir the pot to get a good debate going.

1394
01:14:14,409 --> 01:14:17,087
扎克伯格先生在期末考時作弊？
Mr. Zuckerberg was cheating on his final exam?

1395
01:14:17,087 --> 01:14:18,493
我不想回答那個 格雷琴
I'd rather not answer that, Gretchen.

1396
01:14:18,493 --> 01:14:19,461
為什麼
Then why not?

1397
01:14:19,461 --> 01:14:23,957
我不會指控他考試作弊 因為那不是朋友幹的事
Because I'm not suing him for cheating on his final exam and so that's not what friends do.

1398
01:14:23,957 --> 01:14:25,974
但你剛剛告訴我們他作弊了
Well you just told us he was cheating.

1399
01:14:29,862 --> 01:14:32,200
你告訴你的律師我虐待動物了？
You told your lawyers I was torturing animals?!

1400
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:33,719
不 他什麼也沒告訴我們
No, he didn't tell us about it at all.

1401
01:14:33,719 --> 01:14:36,671
我們的訴訟律師有能力找到校報文章
Our litigators are capable of finding Crimson article.

1402
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:39,133
事實上我們跟他說這件事時 他還為你辯護
In fact when we raised the subject with him he defended you.

1403
01:14:42,699 --> 01:14:45,629
993 就差一點了
Nine-ninety-three, we are so close.

1404
01:14:45,962 --> 01:14:49,550
噢 我想起來了 我們還需要點錢 瓦爾多
Oh yeah, that reminds me, We're gonna need more money, Wardo.

1405
01:14:49,550 --> 01:14:51,461
我知道 更多服務器 更多應用…
I agree. More servers, more apps...

1406
01:14:51,461 --> 01:14:54,430
我要面試兩個實習生 我們要付他們報酬
I'm interviewing two interns to come to Palo Alto and we're gonna have to pay them something.

1407
01:14:54,430 --> 01:14:55,105
抱歉 你說什麼
Sorry what?

1408
01:14:55,105 --> 01:14:58,226
我已經在距離斯坦福 兩個街區的地方找到了出租的房子
I already found a house for rent on a street two blocks from the Stanford campus.

1409
01:14:58,226 --> 01:14:59,629
非常完美 而且還帶游泳池
It is perfect and it's got a pool.

1410
01:14:59,629 --> 01:15:01,673
你什麼時候決定暑假要去加州的
When did you decide to go to California for the summer?

1411
01:15:01,673 --> 01:15:02,898
你是問我什麼時候確定的嗎
You mean when did I actually decide?

1412
01:15:02,898 --> 01:15:05,542
"肖恩·帕克個人秀"的時候？
Somewhere in the middle of The Sean Parker Variety Hour?

1413
01:15:06,736 --> 01:15:08,781
他說得對 我們就該去加州
He was right. California's the place we've gotta be.

1414
01:15:08,781 --> 01:15:10,199
你是加德·克拉皮特嗎 (下面所說的節目主角]
Is you Jed Clampett?

1415
01:15:10,199 --> 01:15:12,158
你們在巴西也能看到"豪門新人類"？ (美國電影)
You guys got The Beverly Hillbillies in Brazil...

1416
01:15:12,158 --> 01:15:14,394
是啊 在巴西也看得到 很好看
Yes, we got the show in Brazil, it was genius.

1417
01:15:14,394 --> 01:15:15,903
你到底對肖恩有什麼意見
What is your problem with Sean?

1418
01:15:16,205 --> 01:15:17,590
他根本沒有什麼上得了檯面的東西
He doesn't bring anything to the table.

1419
01:15:17,590 --> 01:15:19,852
他沒錢 達斯丁編程都比他好
He doesn't have money, Dustin's a better programmer...

1420
01:15:19,852 --> 01:15:21,546
他認識風投的人
He's got connections to the VCs.

1421
01:15:21,546 --> 01:15:24,973
我們不需要風投 我們需要廣告商 而且我也認識風投的人啊
We don't need VCs, we need advertisers and I've got connections to the VCs.

1422
01:15:24,973 --> 01:15:25,985
- 他有經驗而且… - 聽著
- The real players and... - Look

1423
01:15:25,985 --> 01:15:28,165
作為一個剛讓公司顏面受損的人
As someone who's really embarrassed the company in a bad way...

1424
01:15:28,165 --> 01:15:29,533
那是溫克艾沃斯倆幹的好事 馬克
It was the Winklevosses, Mark!

1425
01:15:29,533 --> 01:15:31,677
等一下 點刷新
Hang on. Hit refresh.

1426
01:15:32,802 --> 01:15:35,933
十五萬零四
150.004

1427
01:15:35,933 --> 01:15:38,372
150000個會員 瓦爾多
150.000 members, Wardo.

1428
01:15:38,372 --> 01:15:40,224
- 恭喜你 兄弟 - 恭喜
- Congratulations, dude. - Congratulations.

1429
01:15:40,790 --> 01:15:44,745
你不覺得很奇怪嗎 還被私人偵探跟蹤
You don't think it was strange? That he was followed by private detectives?

1430
01:15:44,745 --> 01:15:45,979
誰人無錯
Who came up with nothing.

1431
01:15:45,979 --> 01:15:48,464
但已經錯到讓他離開公司了 毒品 泡妞…
Enough to get him out of the company. The drugs, the girls...

1432
01:15:48,464 --> 01:15:49,649
我們又不知道那些是不是真的
We don't know any of that's true.

1433
01:15:49,649 --> 01:15:50,410
你可以去查查看
You can read about it.

1434
01:15:50,410 --> 01:15:52,771
我查得到你虐待動物
I can read about your torturing birds. Since when reading something about...

1435
01:15:52,771 --> 01:15:56,233
魚就不吃魚了嗎？! 槍魚和鱒魚？
Don't fish eat other fish?! The marlins and the trout?!

1436
01:15:58,701 --> 01:15:59,394
他在說什麼
What's he talkin' about?

1437
01:15:59,394 --> 01:16:01,972
我明晚十點要去實驗室面試實習生
I'm interviewing interns at 10 tomorrow night in the CS lab.

1438
01:16:02,216 --> 01:16:05,865
隨便你怎麼樣 我無語了
Get on board with this man, you know... I don't really know what else to say.

1439
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:41,958
這是在幹什麼
What's goin' on?

1440
01:16:41,958 --> 01:16:44,559
他們有十分鐘入侵Python服務器
They have 10 mins to get root access to a Python web server,

1441
01:16:44,559 --> 01:16:47,838
破解SSL加密 在安全端口攔截所有流量
Expose its SSL encryption and then intercept all traffic over its secure port.

1442
01:16:47,838 --> 01:16:48,729
他們是在黑別人
They're hacking.

1443
01:16:48,729 --> 01:16:50,865
都是在Pix防火牆模擬器上 但這正是有趣之處
All behind a Pix Firewall Emulator. But here's the beauty.

1444
01:16:50,865 --> 01:16:52,784
你知道我完全聽不懂你在說什麼吧
You know I didn't understand anything you just said, right?

1445
01:16:52,784 --> 01:16:53,960
- 我知道 - 所以好玩之處在哪
- I do know that. - So what's the beauty?

1446
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:56,196
每寫十行代碼 就要喝一杯
Every 10th line of code written, they have to take a shot.

1447
01:16:56,196 --> 01:16:57,273
而且黑客應該隱蔽
And hacking's supposed to be stealth,

1448
01:16:57,273 --> 01:17:00,827
所以服務器每檢測到一次入侵 負責的那個人也要喝一杯
So anytime the server detects an intrusion, the candidate responsible has to take a shot.

1449
01:17:00,827 --> 01:17:04,693
我還有個時不時就同時 在五台電腦上跳出窗口的程序
I also have a program running that has a pop-up window appear simultaneously on all five computers...

1450
01:17:04,693 --> 01:17:06,636
最後一個點窗口的人也得喝一杯
The last candidate to hit the window has to take a shot.

1451
01:17:06,636 --> 01:17:08,870
另外每三分鐘他們也都得喝一杯
Plus every three minutes they all have to take a shot.

1452
01:17:08,870 --> 01:17:10,114
三分鐘到
Three minutes.

1453
01:17:11,858 --> 01:17:15,629
我能問問實習生工作堶 有什麼部分是需要喝醉的嗎
Can I ask, what part of the interns jobs will they need to be able to do drunk?

1454
01:17:15,629 --> 01:17:19,182
對 更應該做的測試是 他們能不能養一個禮拜的雞
You're right. A more relevant test would be seeing if they can keep a chicken alive for a week.

1455
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:22,444
我很刻薄
That was mean.

1456
01:17:22,444 --> 01:17:23,260
看
Here...

1457
01:17:23,866 --> 01:17:24,603
這是什麼
What is this.

1458
01:17:24,603 --> 01:17:27,456
我開了個新賬戶 存進去18000美金
I opened a new account and put $18.000 in it.

1459
01:17:29,378 --> 01:17:30,667
那夠暑假用嗎
Will that get you through the summer?

1460
01:17:38,963 --> 01:17:40,093
歡迎加入Facebook
Welcome to Facebook.

1461
01:17:50,178 --> 01:17:51,912
- 18000美元 - 對
- $18.000 - Yes.

1462
01:17:51,912 --> 01:17:54,709
- 外加你已經投入的1000美元 - 對
- In addition to the $1000 you'd already put up. - Yes.

1463
01:17:54,709 --> 01:17:56,717
總共是19000美元
A total of $19.000 now.

1464
01:17:56,717 --> 01:17:58,236
- 對 - 等等
- Yes. - Hang on.

1465
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:01,784
我只是檢查一下計算
I'm just checking your math on that.

1466
01:18:01,784 --> 01:18:04,861
對 我也得到了同樣的結果
Yes, I got the same thing.

1467
01:18:04,970 --> 01:18:06,263
我能繼續了嗎
May I continue?

1468
01:18:06,571 --> 01:18:11,486
在表達了對扎克伯格先生暑假把公司搬到加州去的憂慮後
After expressing misgivings about Mr. Zuckerberg taking the company and moving it to California for the summer,

1469
01:18:11,486 --> 01:18:14,797
你為什麼改變心意給他18000美元
Why did you turn around and put $18.000 in an account for his use?

1470
01:18:14,797 --> 01:18:18,208
我覺得我們是夥伴 我們是團隊
I figured we were partners. I wanted to be a team player.

1471
01:18:18,442 --> 01:18:21,712
我覺得馬克 達斯丁還有新的實習生
I figured Mark, Dustin and the new interns could work on the site.

1472
01:18:21,712 --> 01:18:24,232
在我去紐約尋求商機的期間 可以做好網站的工作
While I was on generating advertiser interest in New York.

1473
01:18:24,264 --> 01:18:29,036
不過我更多是覺得 就三個月能出什麼事
But mostly I figured, how much could possibly go wrong in three months?

1474
01:18:30,695 --> 01:18:32,059
上上上
go.go...

1475
01:18:37,177 --> 01:18:37,830
我沒死
I didn't die.

1476
01:18:37,830 --> 01:18:38,648
我知道
I know.

1477
01:18:38,648 --> 01:18:40,126
- 我做到了 - 確實
- I made it. - You did.

1478
01:18:42,005 --> 01:18:44,526
我跳了八米遠
That was like an 8.

1479
01:18:44,526 --> 01:18:45,604
最多兩米
That was like a 2.

1480
01:18:45,604 --> 01:18:47,835
- 不是吧 - 沒錯
- It was better than that. - Yeah.

1481
01:18:56,781 --> 01:18:58,394
- 我沒事 - 你確定？
- I'm ok. - You sure...

1482
01:18:58,575 --> 01:18:59,280
對
yeah.

1483
01:18:59,776 --> 01:19:00,782
呀
Yikes.

1484
01:19:02,334 --> 01:19:03,334
門鈴響了
That's the doorbell

1485
01:19:03,785 --> 01:19:04,939
我不知道我們還有門鈴
I don't know we had a door bell.

1486
01:19:04,939 --> 01:19:07,108
- 安德魯 去開門 - 他才不會去開呢
- Andrew get the door. - No, he's wired in.

1487
01:19:07,917 --> 01:19:09,848
我們的安全押金要沒了
That's gonna cut into the security deposit.

1488
01:19:11,717 --> 01:19:13,706
- 安德魯 不錯 - 現在不行
- Andrew... Not now. - Good boy

1489
01:19:18,581 --> 01:19:19,886
- 肖恩 - 馬克
- Sean - Mark.

1490
01:19:19,886 --> 01:19:22,725
- 你住這兒？ - 是啊 你也是？
- Do you live here? - Yeah. Do you?

1491
01:19:22,725 --> 01:19:24,368
我們就住對門 我們看見煙囪
We were right across the street, we saw the chimney...

1492
01:19:24,368 --> 01:19:25,511

What do you mean?

1524
01:21:17,228 --> 01:21:20,623
有個斯坦福的工商碩士叫羅伊·雷蒙 想給他老婆買內衣
A Stanford MBA named Roy Raymond wants to buy his wife some lingerie.

But he's too embarrassed to shop for it at a department store.

And after five years he sells the company to Leslie Wexner and the Limited for four million dollars.

1531

大團圓結局 對吧
Happy ending, right?

1532
01:21:46,977 --> 01:21:51,181
只不過兩年之後 那家公司就值五億美金
Except two years later, the company's worth 500 million dollars.

那是個寓言
Was that a parable?

1536
01:22:04,082 --> 01:22:07,469
跟我在一起的姑娘是維多利亞秘密的模特 所以你才覺得她眼熟
My date is a Victoria Secret model. That's why she looks familiar to you.

1537
01:22:08,245 --> 01:22:10,957

所以我決定做點大事

1544
01:22:25,215 --> 01:22:26,001
這我倒沒聽說過
I didn't know that.

1545
01:22:26,001 --> 01:22:31,224
Napster不是個滑鐵盧 我永遠地改進了音樂行業
Napster wasn't the faillure... I changed the music industry for better and for always.

1546
01:22:31,224 --> 01:22:35,462
也許它沒掙什麼錢 但把不少人氣個半死
They might not have been a good business but it piss a lot of people off.

What the VCs wanna to say, good idea kid, grown up so we could take it from here.

不過這次不是 這是我們的時代
But not this time, this is our time.

在這個時代你可以給他們一張名片 然後說"我是首席執行官 婊子"
This time you gonna hand them a business card that says I'm a CEO... bitch.

1552
01:22:55,310 --> 01:22:56,841

I don't mind that we loss by the Dutch by less than a second.

我們找過行政委員會 也找過了校長
We tried the Ad Board, and we tried talking to the president of the University.

1632
01:28:29,790 --> 01:28:32,052
現在我問你 最後問一次
Now I'm asking you. For the last time.

1633
01:28:32,052 --> 01:28:37,575
讓我們用確鑿的證據 把他告到聯邦法庭上去
Let's take the considerable resources at our disposal and sue him in a federal court.

1634
01:28:37,849 --> 01:28:38,875
拜託
Come on...

1635

是不是有人敲門啊
Is anybody hear that banging?

1649
01:29:28,656 --> 01:29:30,444
你什麼也沒聽見 你在寫代碼
You don't hear anything, you are writing code.

1650
01:29:31,094 --> 01:29:32,429
兄弟 真的有人敲門
Dude, somebody's at the door.

1651
01:29:32,430 --> 01:29:37,980
這不是…
It's not a dish best served cold. It's best served immediately and relentlessly.

1652
01:29:41,450 --> 01:29:43,358
我一會兒再打給你
I'm gonna call you back.

1653

我一直在打他手機
I've been calling his cell.

He was on a 36 hour coding tear so he took a nap for a couple of hours.

1657
01:30:03,927 --> 01:30:04,936
這媯o生了什麼
What happened here?

1658
01:30:04,936 --> 01:30:07,332
不是發生了 是正在發生

1664
01:30:16,059 --> 01:30:18,095
我是說…
I mean the more wasted that I get...

1665

她們多大了 肖恩
How old are they, Sean?

1667
01:30:23,318 --> 01:30:24,504
問這個不禮貌
It's not polite to ask.

1668
01:30:24,504 --> 01:30:25,939
她們多大了
How old are they?

你當然不知道了
No reason you should.

1681

他只不過是擁有價值20億美元的避險基金公司 叫"科拉堮次窶"
He just run a two billion dollar hedge fund called Clarium Capital.

1682
01:31:01,852 --> 01:31:03,187
為什麼他在安排會面
Why's he setting up meetings?

1683

提爾也許願意做個天使般的投資
Thiel may want to make an angel investment.

1684

我不管他是不是天使 為什麼他在安排會面
I don't care if he's an actual angel, why's he setting up business meetings?

馬克 上帝 我退出了實習
Mark, Jesus, I quit the internship.

We've talked about this on the phone, we... I quit on my first day.

我記得你說過了
I do remember you saying that.

1703
01:32:09,796 --> 01:32:10,980
那克奡絡托蝏羆
So, how's Christy?

1704
01:32:12,038 --> 01:32:13,207
她瘋了
She's crazy.

1705
01:32:13,778 --> 01:32:14,630
好笑嗎
Is that fun?

1706
01:32:14,630 --> 01:32:18,968
不 她確實很神經質 超級愛吃醋
No. She's actually psychotic. She's insanely jealous,

1707
01:32:18,968 --> 01:32:22,605
她不理智 我有點被嚇到
She's irrational and I'm frightening of her.

1708
01:32:22,605 --> 01:32:24,417
不過有女朋友還是挺好的
Still, it's nice to have a girlfriend.

01:34:12,580 --> 01:34:14,660
我們會在特拉華州註冊一個集團
We'll file as a Corporation in Delaware

1743
01:34:14,660 --> 01:34:17,354
然後建構新的股份結構 以便讓新的投資者加入
and come up With a stock structure to allow for new investors in.

1744
01:34:17,863 --> 01:34:19,939
現在我要問你一些問題
Now lemme ask you something.

1745
01:34:20,441 --> 01:34:22,183
愛德華多·薩佛林是誰
Who's Eduardo Saverin?

1746
01:34:42,659 --> 01:34:44,188
上帝
Jesus chris...

1747
01:34:47,380 --> 01:34:49,912
- 你什麼時候回來的 - 你嚇死我了 以後要敲門
- When did you get back? - You scared me. I need you to knock.

1748
01:34:49,912 --> 01:34:52,228
你 什麼時候回來的
When-did-you-get-back?

1749
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:56,059
- 今天下午回來的 - 那你打算什麼時候打電話給我
- I got back this afternoon. - And when you gonna call me?

1750
01:34:56,467 --> 01:34:59,663
克麗絲 旅途很辛苦 我很累…
Chris... it was kind of a rough trip and I was tired and...

1751
01:34:59,663 --> 01:35:03,343
或者回我發的47條短信的一條 你知道我發了47條短信嗎
Or answer one of my 47 texts? Did you know I sent 47 texts?

1752
01:35:03,343 --> 01:35:07,004
我知道 我覺得那算是正常現象
I did and I thought that was incredibly normal behavior.

1753
01:35:07,004 --> 01:35:08,738
你是在諷刺我嗎
Are you mocking me?

1754
01:35:08,738 --> 01:35:10,724
我給你帶了個禮物
I brought you a present.

1755
01:35:12,012 --> 01:35:14,786
為什麼你的Facebook主頁上狀態是"單身"
Why does your status say "single" on your Facebook page?

1756
01:35:14,786 --> 01:35:15,778
什麼？
What?

1757
01:35:16,078 --> 01:35:20,189
為什麼你Facebook主頁上 情感狀態寫的是"單身"
Why does your relationship status say "single" on your Facebook page?

1758
01:35:20,189 --> 01:35:21,774
我建那個主頁時我確實是單身
I was single when I set up the page.

1759
01:35:21,774 --> 01:35:23,217
而你都懶得去改一下？
And you just never bothered to change it?

1760
01:35:23,217 --> 01:35:24,360
- 我… - 說啊
- I... - What?!

1761
01:35:25,295 --> 01:35:26,379
我不知道怎麼改
I don't know how.

1762
01:35:26,809 --> 01:35:28,716
你是不是覺得我很傻
Do I look stupid to you?

1763
01:35:28,716 --> 01:35:29,867
不 冷靜點
No. Calm down.

1764
01:35:29,867 --> 01:35:32,452
你是讓我相信Facebook的財務總監
You're asking me to believe that the CFO of Facebook,

1765
01:35:32,452 --> 01:35:35,264
竟然不會改他Facebook主頁上的情感狀態？
Doesn't know how to change his relationship status on Facebook?

1766
01:35:35,264 --> 01:35:38,142
這很尷尬 所以你應該認為我不會拿這撒謊
It's a little embarrassing so you should take it as as sign of trust that I would tell you that.

1767
01:35:38,142 --> 01:35:39,529
- 去死吧 - 別激動
- Go to hell. - Take it easy.

1768
01:35:39,529 --> 01:35:43,858
你沒改是因為那樣你每次去看馬克時 就可以跟那些硅谷的蕩婦亂搞了
You didn't change it so you could screw those Silicon Valley slut every time you go out to see Mark.

1769
01:35:43,858 --> 01:35:45,594
這完全不是事實 我可以保證
That is not ever remotely true and I can promise you...

1770
01:35:45,594 --> 01:35:50,075
那些硅谷蕩婦才不管你Facebook上的情感狀態
That the Silicon Valley Slut don't care what anyone's relationship status is on Facebook.

1771
01:35:50,075 --> 01:35:53,203
- 拜託你拆禮物吧 - 你的電話還能用嘛
- Please open your present. - Your phone does work.

1772
01:35:54,670 --> 01:35:55,514
是馬克
It's Mark.

1773
01:35:55,514 --> 01:35:59,768
好吧 這真棘手 拆禮物吧 是條絲巾
Okay, this is gonna be tricky. Open your present. It's a silk scarf.

1774
01:36:00,608 --> 01:36:03,770
- 你看我圍過圍巾嗎 - 都會有第一次的
- Have you ever seen me wear a scarf? - This'll be your first.

1775
01:36:04,795 --> 01:36:06,325
- 喂 - 你凍結了我們的賬戶？
- yeah. - You froze our account?

1776
01:36:06,325 --> 01:36:08,003
- 沒錯 - 你凍結了賬戶
- I did. - You froze the account.

1777
01:36:08,003 --> 01:36:09,372
我要引起你的重視 馬克
I had to get your attention, Mark.

1778
01:36:09,372 --> 01:36:11,189
你意識到你這是危及整個公司的嗎
Do you realize that you jeopardized the entire company?

1779
01:36:11,189 --> 01:36:13,934
你意識到你的行為 可能會把我所有的努力毀於一旦嗎
Do you realize that your actions could've permanently destroyed everything I've been working on?

1780
01:36:13,934 --> 01:36:14,790
是我們的努力
WE've been working on.

1781
01:36:14,790 --> 01:36:16,534
沒有錢 網站就無法運作
Without money, the site can't function.

1782
01:36:16,534 --> 01:36:20,004
讓我告訴你Facebook和其他網站的區別吧 那就是它永遠不會崩潰
Ok let me tell you the different between Facebook and everybody else, we don't crash ever.

1783
01:36:20,004 --> 01:36:23,933
只要服務器哪怕崩潰一天 我們的名聲就全毀了
If the servers are down for even a day, our entire reputation is irreversibly destroy.

1784
01:36:23,933 --> 01:36:26,020
- 聽著 - 真的 Friendster的失敗就證明了這一點
- Look... - Seriously, I think Friendster prove that!

1785
01:36:26,020 --> 01:36:29,007
就算是很少的人離開 也會對整個用戶群造成巨大的影響
Even a few people leaving would reverberate through the entire user base.

1786
01:36:29,007 --> 01:36:31,058
用戶是互相連通的 這是關鍵
The users are interconnected, that's the whole point!

1787
01:36:31,058 --> 01:36:33,318
大學生在線是因為他們的朋友在線
College kids are online because their friends are online.

1788
01:36:33,318 --> 01:36:35,470
這就像多米諾骨牌效應 你明白了嗎
And if one domino goes, the other dominoes go!

1789
01:36:35,470 --> 01:36:38,849
我再也不想去什麼 猶太兄弟會的"加勒比之夜"了
I'm not going back to the Carribean Night at A-E-Pi.

1790
01:36:40,324 --> 01:36:42,527
老天爺啊
Holy shit...!

1791
01:36:44,920 --> 01:36:47,154
- 你搞什麼飛機 - 你喜歡被人無視嗎
- What's wrong with you! - Did you like being nobody?!

1792
01:36:47,287 --> 01:36:49,191
你喜歡被當作笑話嗎 你想回到那種生活嗎
Did you like being a joke? Do you wanna go back to that?!

1793
01:36:49,191 --> 01:36:50,382
等一下 等一下
Hang on, hang on...

1794
01:36:50,382 --> 01:36:54,111
那是幼稚的行為 不是個成熟男人的作為 而且肯定不是一個朋友的作為
That was the act of a child, not a decent man. And it truly wasn't the act of a friend.

1795
01:36:54,111 --> 01:36:56,355
你知道我今天去取錢的時候有多難堪嗎
You know how embarrassed I was when I tried to cash a check today?

1796
01:36:56,355 --> 01:36:58,651
我不要回到那種生活了 也許你很沮喪
I'm not going back to that life. Maybe you were frustrated.

1797
01:36:58,651 --> 01:36:59,444
對
yeah.

1798
01:37:00,093 --> 01:37:02,112
- 也許你很生氣 - 我確實很生氣
- Maybe you were angry, - I was.

1799
01:37:02,831 --> 01:37:07,584
不過我不介意讓一切都隨風而去 因為我有好消息要告訴你
But I'm willing to let bygones be bygones because I've got a good news.

1800
01:37:07,584 --> 01:37:12,156
我很抱歉 我當時很生氣 可能也太幼稚了
Look, I'm sorry. I was angry and maybe it was childish.

1801
01:37:12,156 --> 01:37:13,734
但我想引起你的注意
But I had to get your attention.

1802
01:37:13,734 --> 01:37:16,877
愛德華多 我說我有好消息要告訴你
Eduardo, I said I've got some good news.

1803
01:37:17,445 --> 01:37:18,149
什麼好消息
What is it?

1804
01:37:18,149 --> 01:37:20,492
彼得·提爾決定給我們五十萬美金的天使投資
Peter Thiel just made an angel investment of a half million dollars.

1805
01:37:20,492 --> 01:37:23,369
- 什麼 - 五十萬美元
- What? - half million dollars

1806
01:37:23,710 --> 01:37:25,980
而且他會給我們辦公室
And he's setting us up in an office.

1807
01:37:26,555 --> 01:37:28,149
他們要重組公司
They want to re-incorporate the company,

1808
01:37:28,149 --> 01:37:30,812
他們想見你 而且需要你簽一些文件
They want to meet you and they need your signature on some documents.

1809
01:37:30,812 --> 01:37:35,029
所以快點做第一班航班到舊金山來 我需要我的財務總監
So get your ass on the first flight back to San Fransisco. I need my CFO.

1810
01:37:40,247 --> 01:37:41,093
我馬上就到
I'm on my way.

1811
01:37:41,093 --> 01:37:42,520
- 瓦爾多 - 在
- Wardo. - Yeah.

1812
01:37:42,969 --> 01:37:43,795
這是我們的成果
We did it.

1813
01:37:47,562 --> 01:37:48,265
瓦爾多
Wardo,

1814
01:37:49,505 --> 01:37:51,237
你已經要回去了嗎
You're going back there already?

1815
01:37:51,345 --> 01:37:52,323
對
Yes.

1816
01:37:54,534 --> 01:37:56,511
還有 我要跟你分手
And also I'm breaking up with you.

1817
01:38:04,590 --> 01:38:07,759
四份文件 頭兩份是股份收購協議
Four documents. These first two are common stock purchase agreements,

1818
01:38:07,759 --> 01:38:10,871
可以讓你購買重組後的Facebook的股份
Allowing you to buy stock in the newly re-incorporated Facebook

1819
01:38:10,871 --> 01:38:13,883
也就是說舊的股份現在已經沒有價值了
as supposed the old share which is now worthless.

1820
01:38:14,416 --> 01:38:15,678
第三份是交換協議
The third is the exchange agreement,

1821
01:38:15,678 --> 01:38:20,739
你可以用舊股份換新股份 最後一份是股東投票協議
Allowing you to exchanges the old shares for new shares and then finally voter holding agreement.

1822
01:38:20,739 --> 01:38:23,183
我會有多少股份？
How many shares of stock will I own?

1823
01:38:23,183 --> 01:38:27,556
- 1,328,334美元 - 上帝啊
- 1.328.334 - Jesus Christ.

1824
01:38:27,556 --> 01:38:30,650
大概是34.4%的股份
That's a 34,4% ownership share.

1825
01:38:30,759 --> 01:38:33,303
為什麼他們在原有的30%上增加了
Why they increase from the original 30%?

1826
01:38:33,303 --> 01:38:36,006
因為你們可能會稀釋原有股份 以用股份吸引新的投資者
Because you may need to dilute it to award shares to new investors.

1827
01:38:36,723 --> 01:38:38,953
- 我真喜歡跟學商的人合作 - 是啊
- I love working with business majors. -

1828
01:38:38,953 --> 01:38:40,262
- 學經濟的 - 對
- Economics. - right.

1829
01:38:40,262 --> 01:38:45,759
你應該知道馬克的股份已經從60%降到51%了
You should know that Mark's already taken his percentage from 60 down to 51.

1830
01:38:46,484 --> 01:38:49,344
馬克不在乎錢 而且他需要保護
Well, Mark doesn't care about money and he needs to be protected.

1831
01:38:51,747 --> 01:38:57,445
達斯丁·莫斯克維茨擁有6.81% 肖恩·帕克有6.47%
Dustin Moskowitz owns 6,81%, Sean Parker 6,47%

1832
01:38:59,488 --> 01:39:02,415
可以接受 還有彼得·提爾占7%
I can live with that. And Peter Theil 7%

1833
01:39:05,925 --> 01:39:08,429
要用我的筆嗎
Would you like to use my pen?

1834
01:39:09,135 --> 01:39:10,173
愛德華多？
Eduardo?

1835
01:39:11,573 --> 01:39:12,547
愛德華多？
Eduardo?

1836
01:39:13,857 --> 01:39:15,068
你能重複一遍問題嗎
Can you please repeat the question?

1837
01:39:15,068 --> 01:39:17,203
不 那種尖銳的問題問一次都是可恥的
No. It was an outrageously leading question, the first time.

1838
01:39:17,203 --> 01:39:18,589
而你現在還想再聽一次？
Now you want to hear it twice?

1839
01:39:18,589 --> 01:39:20,199
你能重複一遍嗎
Would you re-read that please?

1840
01:39:20,882 --> 01:39:21,526
問吧
Go ahead.

1841
01:39:21,526 --> 01:39:23,502
你在簽署這些文件時
And when you signed these documents,

1842
01:39:23,502 --> 01:39:26,315
有沒有意識到你是在簽下自己的死亡證明
Were you aware that you were signing your own death certificate?

1843
01:39:26,315 --> 01:39:27,083
沒有
No.

1844
01:39:31,721 --> 01:39:36,333
當時我沒有請律師來檢查一遍那些文件 我真是太愚蠢了
It was insanely stupid of me not to have my own lawyer look over all the... uh,

1845
01:39:36,333 --> 01:39:39,402
說實話我當時就覺得他們是我的律師
In all honesty I thought they were my lawyers.

1846
01:39:42,565 --> 01:39:47,712
我是你唯一的朋友 你只有一個朋友
I was your only friend. You had one friend.

1847
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:53,761
- 我父親都不再理我了 - 愛德華多
- My father won't even look at me. - Okay. Eduardo.

1848
01:39:53,761 --> 01:39:58,149
扎克伯格先生在你簽文件後說了什麼嗎
Did Mr. Zuckerberg saying anything to you after you signed the papers?

1849
01:39:58,382 --> 01:40:01,494
當時不停握手 祝賀之類的
There was a lot of handshaking and a lot of congratulations.

1850
01:40:02,638 --> 01:40:06,457
他告訴了我 他至少有一學期不能回學校
He'd already told me he wouldn't be coming back to school for at least a semester.

1851
01:40:07,216 --> 01:40:09,477
所以我們還道了一下別
So we were saying goodbye for a while.

1852
01:40:10,811 --> 01:40:13,322
- 然後在我走之前 他說… - 但你必須回來
- And then before I left, he said... - But you gotta come back.

1853
01:40:13,322 --> 01:40:15,689
十一月末十二月初的時候
Somewhere around the end of November or early December.

1854
01:40:15,777 --> 01:40:18,371
彼得想等我們用戶突破百萬時 搞個盛大的慶功宴
Peter wanna throw us an amazing party when we hit a million members,

1855
01:40:18,371 --> 01:40:20,415
絕對是空前的 你一定要回來參加
It's gonna be out of control. You gotta come back for it.

1856
01:40:20,415 --> 01:40:21,599
一百萬用戶
A million members.

1857
01:40:21,599 --> 01:40:22,459
對
Yeah.

1858
01:40:23,427 --> 01:40:26,621
還記得宿舍窗上的運算法則嗎
The algorithm on the window at Kirkland?

1859
01:40:27,547 --> 01:40:28,139
是的
Yeah.

1860
01:40:32,377 --> 01:40:33,511
是的 我會來參加的
Yeah, I'll be here.

1861
01:40:38,700 --> 01:40:40,870
- 你確定我要這麼做嗎？ - 你遲到了20分鐘
- You sure about this? - You're 20 mins late.

1862
01:40:40,870 --> 01:40:43,672
你要進去 說你睡過頭了 沒時間整理著裝
You're gonna walk in there and say you overslept and you didn't have time to get dressed.

1863
01:40:43,672 --> 01:40:44,376
他們會央求你的
They're gonna pitch you.

1864
01:40:44,376 --> 01:40:47,520
"追逐平等"會央求你收下他們的錢
Chase equity is going to pitch you. They're gonna beg you to take their money.

1865
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:50,672
你就點頭 點頭 點頭 然後說
You're gonna nod, you're gonna nod, you're gonna nod and then you're gonna say,

1866
01:40:50,672 --> 01:40:52,593
"你們誰是拉爾夫"
"Which one of you is Ralph"

1867
01:40:52,593 --> 01:40:55,438
不 不是拉爾夫… 是馬寧漢姆 你們誰是米切爾·馬寧漢姆
No, not Ralph... No Manningham. Which one of you, Michael Manningham?

1868
01:40:55,438 --> 01:40:56,483
然後他會說 "是我"
And he'll say I am.

1869
01:40:56,483 --> 01:41:01,148
然後你就說 肖恩·帕克說"草泥馬" 然後你就走出來
Then you'll say, Sean Parker says "Fuck You." Walk out.

1870
01:41:01,693 --> 01:41:02,422
好
Okay.

1871
01:41:15,991 --> 01:41:19,922
十一月下旬我收到馬克的郵件 讓我去參加百萬用戶慶功宴
In late November I got the e-mail from Mark telling me to come out for the millionth member party.

1872
01:41:19,922 --> 01:41:21,660
那封郵件還說什麼了？
What else did e-mail say?

1873
01:41:21,660 --> 01:41:24,086
還說我們要開個工作會議
It said that we had to have a business meeting.

1874
01:41:24,754 --> 01:41:28,274
馬克和肖恩對Chase Equity 玩了某種報復小把戲
That Mark and Sean had playing some kind of revenge stunt to Chase Equity.

1875
01:41:28,758 --> 01:41:33,478
馬寧漢姆印象深刻 所以他開出了難以拒絕的條件
Manningham was so impressed that he was makin' an investment offer that was hard to turn down.

1876
01:41:34,464 --> 01:41:38,200
於是我就去了加州 直接去了新公司
I went out to California and I went straight to the New Offices.

1877
01:41:38,717 --> 01:41:44,363
我不知道該打扮成去參加派對 還是去開會 所以我就摻雜了兩者
I didn't know whether to dress for the party or the business meeting so I kinda dressed for both.

1878
01:41:45,724 --> 01:41:46,733
不過這不重要
But it didn't matter.

1879
01:41:46,920 --> 01:41:47,572
為什麼
Why not?

1880
01:41:47,572 --> 01:41:49,925
因為我不是因這兩個原因被叫去的
Because I wasn't called out there for either one...

1881
01:41:49,925 --> 01:41:51,739
你是為什麼被叫去的呢
What were you called out there for?

1882
01:41:55,324 --> 01:41:56,684
伏擊
An ambush.

1883
01:41:56,912 --> 01:41:58,599
薩佛林先生 你好
Mr. Saverin. Hi...

1884
01:41:58,599 --> 01:41:59,699
過來這邊
Hey. Right over here.

1885
01:42:11,215 --> 01:42:15,049
起初我以為他是開玩笑 要給我簽更多的合同
At first I thought he was joking, giving me more contracts to sign.

1886
01:42:19,070 --> 01:42:20,813
但之後我開始看條款
But then I started reading.

1887
01:42:24,004 --> 01:42:25,250
這是什麼
What is this?

1888
01:42:26,343 --> 01:42:29,422
你知道我們有一些新的投資者
Well, as you know we had some new investor that...

1889
01:42:29,422 --> 01:42:30,823
這是什麼
What is this?

1890
01:42:42,863 --> 01:42:44,148
薩佛林先生
Mr. Saverin.

1892
01:42:49,379 --> 01:42:50,173
馬克!
MARK...!

1893
01:42:50,173 --> 01:42:51,302
- 他很忙 - 是嗎
- He's wired in. - Sorry

1894
01:42:51,302 --> 01:42:51,962
他很忙
He's wired in.

1895
01:42:51,962 --> 01:42:53,346
- 是嗎 - 是的
- Is he? - Yes.

1896
01:42:54,876 --> 01:42:56,222
那現在呢 你還忙嗎
How about now, you still wired in?

1897
01:42:56,222 --> 01:42:57,331
叫保安
Call security!

1898
01:42:57,331 --> 01:43:01,151
你發行了兩千四百萬新股票
You issued over 24-million new shares of stock.

1899
01:43:01,151 --> 01:43:03,015
之前告訴過你如果有新的投資者…
You were told that if new investors came along...

1900
01:43:03,015 --> 01:43:05,343
你的股份會被稀釋多少？ 他的呢？
How much your shares are diluted? How much are his?!

1901
01:43:05,843 --> 01:43:09,136
扎克伯格先生的股份稀釋到了多少
What was Mr. Zuckerberg's ownership share diluted down to?

1902
01:43:10,513 --> 01:43:11,139
沒有稀釋
It wasn't.

沒有稀釋
It wasn't.

1909
01:43:24,312 --> 01:43:27,965
你的股份稀釋到了多少
What was your ownership share diluted down to?

1910
01:43:28,566 --> 01:43:31,403
百分之零點三
Point-zero-three-percent.

1911
01:43:38,806 --> 01:43:41,193
- 你簽了那些文件 - 你給我下了套
- You signed the papers. - You set me up.

1912
01:43:41,193 --> 01:43:43,864
你是因為你是這公司的財務總監
You blame me because you were the business head of the company,

1913
01:43:43,864 --> 01:43:45,940
卻把自己的財務搞砸了才來怪我嗎
And you made a bad business deal with your own company?!

1914
01:43:45,940 --> 01:43:47,532
這就好像我不是Facebook的一份子
It's gonna be like I'm not part of Facebook.

1915
01:43:47,532 --> 01:43:50,122
不會好像你不是Facebook的一份子 你確實不是Facebook的一份子
It won't be like you're not a part of Facebook, You're not part of Facebook.

1916
01:43:50,122 --> 01:43:51,230
我的名字在首頁上
My name's on the masthead.

1917
01:43:51,230 --> 01:43:52,715
你可以再看看
You may wanna check again.

1918
01:43:52,715 --> 01:43:53,900
是因為我凍結了賬戶嗎
This is because I froze the account?

1919
01:43:53,900 --> 01:43:56,227
你覺得我們會讓你 穿著可笑的西裝招搖過市
You think we were gonna let you parade around in your ridiculous suits,

1920
01:43:56,227 --> 01:43:57,496
假裝你在運營這家公司嗎
Pretending you were running this company?

1921
01:43:57,496 --> 01:43:59,722
真不好意思啊 我的普拉達還在乾洗店
Sorry, my Prada is at the cleaners,

1922
01:43:59,722 --> 01:44:04,218
和我的風衣還有'草泥馬'人字拖一起 你們這些虛偽的孬種!
Along with my hoodie and my 'Fuck You' Flip-Flops, you pretentious douche bag!

1923
01:44:04,218 --> 01:44:06,896
- 保安來了 你最好離開這 - 我不會簽那些文件的
- Security is here. You'll be leaving now. - I'm not signing those papers.

1924
01:44:06,896 --> 01:44:08,574
我們會拿到你的簽名的
We will get your signature.

1925
01:44:09,224 --> 01:44:11,334
告訴我這不是因為我進了鳳凰社
Tell me this isn't about me getting into the Phoenix.

1926
01:44:13,871 --> 01:44:18,067
是你幹的 我就知道是你幹的 那隻雞是你設計我害我的
You... you did it. I knew you did it. You planted the story about the chicken.

1927
01:44:18,067 --> 01:44:19,669
我沒有用雞來設計害你
I didn't planted the story about the chicken.

1928
01:44:19,669 --> 01:44:21,605
- 他在說什麼 - 你指控我虐待動物
- What he talking about? - 

1929
01:44:21,605 --> 01:44:23,040
真的 這雞是怎麼回事
Seriously, what the hell with the chicken?

1930
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:25,417
我相信你最痛恨的
And I'll bet what you hated the most,

1931
01:44:25,417 --> 01:44:28,928
就是他們還把我寫成Facebook的創始人之一
They said they identified me as a co-founder of Facebook.

1932
01:44:28,928 --> 01:44:31,730
而我正是 你最好快點請律師 渾蛋
Which I am! You better lawyer-up, asshole,

1933
01:44:31,730 --> 01:44:37,637
因為我不會為了30%回來 我要拿走我應得的一切
'Cause I'm not comin' back for 30% I'm comin' back for everything!

1934
01:44:43,025 --> 01:44:45,045
- 把他帶出去 - 沒事 我自己走
- Get him outta here. - It's okay. I'm going.

1935
01:44:47,911 --> 01:44:48,624
等等
Hang on...

1936
01:44:51,523 --> 01:44:52,620
差點忘記了
Almost forgot.

1937
01:44:54,041 --> 01:44:55,320
這是你的19000美元
Here's your $19.000.

1938
01:44:55,320 --> 01:44:57,895
但我沒法兌現它 因為賬戶被你凍結了
I wouldn't cash it though. I drew it on the account you froze.

1939
01:45:03,338 --> 01:45:05,478
我很喜歡站在你旁邊 肖恩
I like standing next to you, Sean.

1940
01:45:07,075 --> 01:45:08,931
顯得我特別爺們兒
It makes me look so tough.

1941
01:45:24,051 --> 01:45:26,382
今晚的表演到此結束 各位
That's it. That's our show for tonight, people.

1942
01:45:27,086 --> 01:45:29,308
我想看到大家盡情享受派對
Look, I want to see everybody here get geared up for a party.

1943
01:45:29,308 --> 01:45:31,670
我們要像梅西百貨感恩節遊行一樣 走進那家酒吧
We're gonna walk down to the club like it's the Macy's Parade.

1944
01:45:31,670 --> 01:45:35,005
瑪奇 放大屏幕 我們馬上就要破百萬了
Mackey, put it up on the big screen, we've gotta almost be there.

1945
01:45:38,033 --> 01:45:39,719
- 你還好吧 - 嗯
- You alright? - Yeah.

1946
01:45:41,247 --> 01:45:42,337
你有點過分了
You were kinda rough on him.

1947
01:45:42,755 --> 01:45:44,123
這就是現實的人生
That's life in the NFL.

1948
01:45:44,973 --> 01:45:47,276
- 你知道你可以不用那麼過分的 - 聽著 馬克 我只是…
- No. You didn't have to be that rough on him.

1949
01:45:47,276 --> 01:45:48,253
肖恩
Sean...

1950
01:45:50,113 --> 01:45:53,318
- 你可以不用那麼過分的 - 他差點毀了公司
- You didn't have to be that rough on him. - He almost killed it!

1951
01:45:56,357 --> 01:45:57,571
我會給他送花道歉的
I'll send flowers.

1952
01:45:57,571 --> 01:46:03,872
說到花 今天的派對結束後 女生那邊還要搞個派對
Speaking of flowers, I'm putting together a party after the party at Kappa Eta Sigma.

1953
01:46:03,872 --> 01:46:05,353
艾斯麗是其中之一
Ashleigh there's a sister.

1954
01:46:05,353 --> 01:46:06,336
艾斯麗？
Ashleigh.

1955
01:46:06,336 --> 01:46:07,254
- 實習生 - 對
- The Intern. - yeah.

1956
01:46:07,847 --> 01:46:09,249
我知道她是誰
I know who she is.

1957
01:46:09,549 --> 01:46:10,502
你是不是…
Are you guys?

1958
01:46:10,801 --> 01:46:14,017
艾斯麗和我？ 沒有 好吧 有一點…
Ashleigh and me... no... A little bit.

1959
01:46:15,174 --> 01:46:15,766
怎麼了
Why?

1960
01:46:16,188 --> 01:46:17,398
打擾一下 馬克
Excuse me, Mark.

1961
01:46:17,923 --> 01:46:19,496
我們正說到你呢
We were just talkin' about you,

1962
01:46:19,496 --> 01:46:21,106
你工作做得很出色
You're doing a really good job.

1963
01:46:21,639 --> 01:46:23,998
謝謝 我很榮幸
Thanks. I appreciate that.

1964
01:46:24,918 --> 01:46:26,376
這是給你的
This came in for you.

1965
01:46:26,718 --> 01:46:27,845
放我桌上吧
Put on my desk.

1966
01:46:34,727 --> 01:46:36,055
這包裹是什麼
What's the package.

1967
01:46:37,051 --> 01:46:37,781
沒什麼
Nothing.

1968
01:46:40,621 --> 01:46:41,367
瑪奇
Mackey...

1969
01:46:41,565 --> 01:46:42,134
是
Yes, Sir.

1970
01:46:42,134 --> 01:46:43,468
刷新
Refresh!

1971
01:46:51,540 --> 01:46:54,462
我知道你不喜歡擁抱
And you need a hugger, I know.

1972
01:46:57,531 --> 01:46:59,043
一百萬
1 millions, 

1973
01:47:00,854 --> 01:47:02,415
誰有香檳
who's got champagne?

1974
01:47:26,398 --> 01:47:29,862
下一步計劃是做一個照片分享的應用
...A pic sharing application.

1975
01:47:29,862 --> 01:47:32,956
一個可以在社交圈堣嬤伢茪貜漲a方
A place where you view pictures that coincide with your social life.

1976
01:47:32,956 --> 01:47:36,369
是你生活的數字化真實寫照
It is the true digitalization of your life.

1977
01:47:36,369 --> 01:47:38,540
- 看到了嗎 - 看看我美不美
- You can use a CD. - You can do it off of me.

1978
01:47:38,698 --> 01:47:42,264
你不需要去參加派對 你可以用相機參加派對
You don't just go to a party anymore, you go to a party with your digital camera,

1979
01:47:42,264 --> 01:47:44,423
而你的朋友就可以在網上重現派對
And then your friends re-live the party online.

1980
01:47:44,423 --> 01:47:45,974
還可以加標籤 這創意…
And tagging. The idea...

1981
01:47:45,974 --> 01:47:47,895
把罩罩脫了會不會更方便
Would this be easier without the bra?

1982
01:47:47,895 --> 01:47:49,622
可以試試看
It's worth finding out.

1983
01:47:57,088 --> 01:47:58,867
關掉音樂 立刻!
Stop the music, now!

1984
01:48:03,603 --> 01:48:05,904
我花了很多時間研究人們登錄後都做什麼
I've spent hours... watching what people do when they log on

1985
01:48:05,904 --> 01:48:07,730
他們怎麼查看好友的狀態更新
They check friends status update,

1986
01:48:07,730 --> 01:48:09,357
好奇怪 音樂怎麼沒了
That's weird, why the music off...

1987
01:48:09,357 --> 01:48:12,385
查看那些好友修改了資料 換了照片以及…
Checked to see which of their friends had changed their profiles, changed their photos and mostly...

1988
01:48:12,385 --> 01:48:13,672
說真的 音樂怎麼了
Seriously, what happen with the music

1989
01:48:13,672 --> 01:48:18,007
我們在農場生活過 後來生活在城市 而我們現在要生活在互聯網絡上
We lived on farms, and then we lived in cities and now we're going to live on internet

1990
01:48:18,007 --> 01:48:21,369
肖恩 打住 我覺得樓下有什麼事
Sean. Stop, I think something's goin' on downstairs.

1991
01:48:31,965 --> 01:48:33,674
注意一下
Please...

1992
01:48:33,674 --> 01:48:35,116
各回各家吧
