1
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,140
Did you know there are more people with genius IQ living in China

2
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,880
than there are people of any kind living in the United States?

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,130
That can't possibly be true.

4
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:23,900
It is true.

5
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:24,800
What would account for that?

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,540
Well first of all, a lot of people live in China.

7
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:26,910
But here's my question:

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,870
How do you distinguish yourself

9
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,050
in a population of people who all got 1600 on their SAT's?

10
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:32,860
I didn't know they take SAT in China.

11
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:35,190
They dont,I wasn't talking about China anymore, I was talking about me.

12
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,510
You got 1600?

13
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,500
Yes. I can sing in a Acapella group. But I cant sing.

14
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:40,890
Does that mean that you actually got nothing wrong?

15
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,700
Or you row crew or you invent a 25 dollar PC.

16
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:43,950
Or you get into a final club.

17
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,200
Or you get into a final club, exactly.

18
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,670
You know from a woman's perspective

19
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,140
sometimes not being in an Accapella group can be a good thing.

20
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:49,760
This is serious.

21
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,960
Well I am admitting I do like guys who row crew.

22
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,470
Well I cant do that.

23
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:54,350
I was kidding.

24
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:55,990
Yes. I got nothing wrong on the test.

25
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:57,910
Have you ever tried?

26
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:58,750
I'm trying now.

27
00:00:58,870 --> 00:00:59,790
To row crew?

28
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,460
To get into a final club. To row crew?

29
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,060
No. Are you, like-whatever-delusional?

30
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:04,070
Maybe just sometimes.

31
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,070
Sometimes, you say two things at once

32
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:05,940
and I'm not sure which one we're aiming at.

33
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,720
But you've seen guys who row crew, right?

34
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,420
No.

35
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,480
Okay, well, they are bigger than me.

36
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,640
They're the world class athletes.

37
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,930
And a second ago you said you like guys who row crew

38
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:14,300
so I assumed you'd met one.

39
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,630
I guess I meant I liked the idea of it.

40
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,650
The way a girl likes cowboys.

41
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:19,550
Okay.

42
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,220
Should we get something to eat?

43
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,240
Would you rather talk about something else?

44
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,380
No, it's just that since the beginning of the

45
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,470
conversation about finals clubs I think I may have missed a birthday.

46
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,610
There are more people in China with genius iQ than the entire population of...?

47
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:34,800
The Phoenix is the most diverse.

48
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,160
The Fly Club, Roosevelt punched the Porc.

49
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,170
Which one?

50
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,080
The Porcelain, the Porc, it's the best of the best.

51
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,240
Which Roosevelt.

52
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,040
Theodore.

53
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,590
Is it true they send a bus around

54
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,900
to pick up girls who want to party with the next chairman?

55
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:47,830
You can see why it's so important to get in.

56
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,940
Okay, well, which is the easiest one to get into?

57
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,020
Why would you ask me that?

58
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,500
I was just asking.

59
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,210
None of them. That's the point.

60
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,310
Our freind Eduardo made $300,000

61
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,130
betting on oil future last summer and

62
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,500
Eduardo won't come close to getting in.

63
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,560
The ability to make money doesn't impress anybody around here.

64
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,250
Must be nice.

65
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,090
He made $300,000 in a summer?

66
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,890
He likes Meteorology.

67
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:09,890
I thought it was oil futures.

68
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:10,600
You can read the weather,

69
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,610
you can predict the price of heating oil.

70
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,950
I think you asked me that because you think the final

71
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,090
club that's easiest to get into is the one where I'll have the best chance.

72
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,550
I...what?

73
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,590
You asked me which one was the easiest to

74
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:23,200
get into because you think that's where I have the best chance.

75
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:27,230
The one that's easiest to get into would be the one where anybody had the best chance.

76
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,970
You didnt ask which one was the best one,

77
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,520
you asked me which one was the easiest.

78
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,870
I was honestly just asking. Okay? I was asking just to ask.

79
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,030
Mark, I'm not speaking in code.

80
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:36,690
Erica

81
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:37,300
You're obsessed with the finals clubs.

82
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:37,880
You have finals clubs OCD and you need to see someone about this

83
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,560
who'll prescribe some sort of medication.

84
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,390
You don't care if side effects may include blindness,

85
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,090
Final clubs,

86
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:48,510
not finals clubs.

87
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,390
And there's a difference between being obsessed and being motivated.

88
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,230
Yes. There is.

89
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,440
Well, what you do, that was cryptic, so you do speak in code.

90
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,330
I didn't mean to be cryptic.

91
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:59,820
All I'm saying I need to do something

92
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,820
substantial in order to get the attention of the clubs.

93
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:02,480
Why?

94
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,380
Because they are exclusive.

95
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,390
And fun and they lead me to a better life.

96
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,230
You think Teddy Roosevelt got elected

97
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,880
president because he was a member of the Phoenix Club?

98
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,730
He was a member of the Porcellian and yes he did.

99
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:16,230
Well why dont you concentrate on being the best you, you can be.

100
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:17,610
Did you really just say that

101
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,520
I was kidding

102
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,210
I'm just stating the fact and that doesn't make it any less true.

103
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,170
I want to be straight forward and tell you that

104
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:24,290
I think you should be a lot more supportive.

105
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:27,410
If I get in i'll be taking you to the events and the gatherings

106
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:30,360
and you'll be meeting people that you wouldn't normally get to meet .

107
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,820
You would do that for me?

108
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,830
Indeed.

109
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:39,440
Okay I want to try and be straight forward with you

110
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,840
and let you know that were not anymore.

111
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,520
What do you mean?

112
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,670
We were not dating anymore, I'm sorry.

113
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,280
Is this a joke?

114
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,540
No, it's not.

115
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,700
You're breaking up with me?

116
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,800
You're going to introduce me to people I wouldn't normally get to meet?

117
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,530
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

118
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,340
Settle down.

119
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,200
What was it supposed to mean?

120
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,810
Erica, the reason we're able to sit here and drink is

121
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:57,890
that you used to sleep with the door guy.

122
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,480
The door guy, his name is Bobby.

123
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,280
I haven't slept with the door guy, the door guy's a friend of mine.

124
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,000
He's a perfectly good class of people

125
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,160
and what part of Long-Island are you from?

126
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,590
Wimbledon?

127
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,120
Wait.

128
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,660
I'm going back to my dorm.

129
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,260
Wait wait.

130
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:13,870
Is this real?

131
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:14,540
Yes.

132
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,370
Then wait, I apologize, okay?

133
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:16,300
I have to go...

134
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,230
Erica

135
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:17,870
Yes?

136
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:18,450
I'm sorry and I mean it..

137
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:20,090
I appreciate that but I have to study

138
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:21,170
Come on. You don't have to study.

139
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,000
You don't have to study. Let's just talk.

140
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,740
I can't.

141
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,520
Why?

142
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:24,990
Because it's exhausting.

143
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,460
Dating you is like dating a stairmaster.

144
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,340
All I meant is that you're not likely to...currently

145
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,290
I wasn't making an coment on your parents.

146
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,500
I was saying you go to B.U.

147
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,130
I was stating a fact. That's all.

148
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:32,640
If you think I'm rude...

149
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:34,270
I have to go study.

150
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,530
You don't have to study.

151
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,680
Why do you keep saying I dont have to study?

152
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,300
Because you go to B.U.!

153
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,190
Do you want to get some food?

154
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:45,680
I'm sorry you're not sufficiently impressed with my education.

155
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,820
And I'm sorry I don't have a rowboat.

156
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:47,830
So were even.

157
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,350
I think we should just be friends.

158
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:50,590
I don't want friends.

159
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,890
I was being polite, I had no intention of being friends with you.

160
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,130
I'm under some pressure right now from my O.S. class.

161
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:56,250
If we could just order some food, I think we should...

162
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:00,930
Listen, you're probably going to be a very succesful computer person.

163
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:05,440
But you're going to go through life thinking that girls don't

164
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,410
like you because you're a nerd.

165
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:12,150
And I want you to know, from the bottom of my heart, that won't be true.

166
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:15,040
It'll be because you're an asshole.

167
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,430
Erica Albright is a bitch.

168
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,270
Do you think that's because her family changed

169
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:23,910
their name from Albrecht or do you think it's because all B.U. Girls are bitches?

170
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:33,840
For the record, she may look like a 34C

171
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,210
but she's getting all kinds of help from our friends at Victoria's Secret.

172
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:37,840
She's a 34B, as in barely anything there.

173
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,730
False advertising.

174
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:44,080
The truth is she has a nice face.

175
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,160
I need to do something to take my mind off her.

176
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,980
Easy enough, except I need an idea.

177
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,180
I'm a little intoxicated, I'm not gonna lie.

178
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:00,050
So what if it's not even 10PM and it's a Tuesday night?

179
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:02,310
The Kirkland facehook is open on my desktop

180
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,990
and some of these people have pretty horrendous facebook pics.

181
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,380
Billy Olson's sitting here and had the idea of putting some of

182
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,790
the pictures next to pictures of farm animals

183
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,320
and have people vote on who's hotter.

184
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,560
Good call, Mr.Olson

185
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:21,840
Yeah, it's on.

186
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,890
I'm not gonna do the farm animals

187
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,720
but I like the idea of comparing two people together.

188
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,590
It gives the whole thing a very

189
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,690
"Turing"

190
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:32,910
feel since people's ratings of the pictures will be more implicit than, say, choosing a number to represent each person's hotness like they do on hotornot.com.

191
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,990
The first thing we're going to need is a lot of pictures.

192
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:37,560
Unfortunately, Harvard doesn't keep a public centralized facebook

193
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,650
so I'm going to get all the images from the individual houses that people are in.

194
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,560
Let the hacking begin.

195
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,190
First up is Kirkland.

196
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,440
They keep everything open

197
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,310
and allow indexes in their Apache configuration,

198
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,980
so a little WGET magic

199
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:08,380
is all that's necessary to download the entire Kirkland facebook.

200
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,470
Kids stuff.

201
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,140
Next is Elliot.

202
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,970
They're also open but with no indexes on Apache.

203
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:31,180
I can run an empty search

204
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,850
and it returns all of the images in the database in a single page.

205
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:35,940
Then I can save the page and Mozilla

206
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:36,630
will save all the images for me.

207
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:37,850
Excellent.

208
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,070
Moving right along.

209
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:40,680
Excuse me, everybody.

210
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,460
You are in one of the oldest,

211
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,670
one of the most exclusive clubs, not just in Havard, in the world.

212
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,070
Now I would welcome you to Phoenix first party of the falls emester

213
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,220
Lowell has some security.

214
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,700
They require a username/password combo,

215
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,700
and I'm going to go ahead and say they don't have access to main FAS user database,

216
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,420
so they have no way of detecting an intrusion

217
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:08,930
Adams has no security

218
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,210
but limits the number of results to 20 a page.

219
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:12,030
All I have to is break up the same script I used on Lowell and it's set.

220
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,650
Quincy has no online Facebook,

221
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:19,290
what a sham.

222
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:20,570
Nothing I can do about that.

223
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:22,580
Dunster is intense.

224
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:25,900
Not only is there no public directory but there's no directory at all.

225
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:26,870
You have to do searches and

226
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:29,430
every search returns more than 20 matches nothing is returned.

227
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:32,100
Once you do get results they don't link directly to the images,

228
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,230
they link to a PHP that redirects or something. Weird.

229
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,100
This maybe diffucult, I'll come back later.

230
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,100
- Hey, Sheldon's up. - What?

231
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,100
- Great wine, beautiful fish. - Thanks.

232
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,630
Leverett is a little better.

233
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:42,640
It's still make you search but you

234
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,410
can do an empty search and gets links to pages with every student's picture.

235
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:48,180
It's slightly obnoxious that they let you view one picture at a time.

236
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,140
And there's no way I am gonna go to 500 hundred pages,

237
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,330
to download pictures one hundred times.

238
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:52,670
So its definitely necessary to break out the EMACS

239
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,340
and modify that Perl script.

240
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:12,490
Done.

241
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:14,660
What's going on?

242
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:16,740
Perfect timing. Eduardo's here

243
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,720
and he's going to have the key ingredient.

244
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,350
- Mark -What up?

245
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:21,560
You and Erica split up?

246
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:23,880
How did you know that?

247
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,240
It's on your blog.

248
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:27,270
Oh yeah.

249
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:27,990
Are you alright?

250
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:28,830
I need you.

251
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,210
I'm here for you.

252
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,810
No, I need the algorithm you used for the oil futures.

253
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:33,580
Are you okay?

254
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:34,960
We're ranking girls.

255
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,610
You mean other students.

256
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:39,310
Yeah.

257
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:40,970
You think that's such a good idea?

258
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,690
I need the algorithm.

259
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:44,220
I need the algorithm.

260
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:48,390
Give each girl a base rating of 1400.

261
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,670
At any time "Girl A" has a rating R-a

262
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,510
and "Girl B" has e rating R-b.

263
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:54,680
When any two girls are matched up there's

264
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,690
an expectation of which will win based on their current rating.

265
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:57,310
Yeah.

266
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,440
And Those expectations are expressed this way.

267
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:01,780
Let's write it.

268
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:17,680
The one on the left.

269
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:19,850
On the right.

270
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:21,710
The right.

271
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:22,290
It works.

272
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:23,820
Who should we send it to first?

273
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,110
- Dwyer. - Neal.

274
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,250
Who are you gonna send it to?

275
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:31,220
Just a Couple of people. The question is, who are they gonna send it to?

276
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,030
Hey guys, check this out.

277
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:05,760
The one on the left.

278
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:09,320
These girls, right or Left?

279
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:09,950
Left.

280
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:13,920
Right or Left?

281
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,450
That's my roommate.

282
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:18,820
Oh my God. On the left.

283
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,280
This is pathetic.

284
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,300
Right.

285
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:23,640
Left.

286
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:25,550
Left.

287
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,550
Shit!

288
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:32,310
Albright, he blogged about you.

289
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,890
You don't want to read this.

290
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:44,550
Erica, is this yours?

291
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:47,130
I stole it from a trainee.

292
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,500
Get the hell out of here.

293
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,920
Thats an awful lot of traffic.

294
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:06,140
You think maybe we should shut it down before we get into trouble.

295
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,160
Hello?

296
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,720
Wait wait wait...

297
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:22,870
At 4 in the morning?

298
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:26,190
Well there is an unusual amount of traffic which occured.

299
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:28,620
Your saying its unusal for 4 in the morning?

300
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,250
No, this would be unusuall

301
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,410
for half time at the superbowl.

302
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:33,460
Alright.

303
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,120
I gotta go in.

304
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,290
What's going on?

305
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:42,610
The Harvard network is about to crash.

306
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:50,470
You dont think...

307
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,290
I do.

308
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,080
God saves us everybody.

309
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,240
Can't connect.

310
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,840
The network is down.

311
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:09,360
Unless this is a coincidence I would think this is us.

312
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,430
It's not a coincidence.

313
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,670
Oh shit.

314
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,550
So you're called in front of the ad. board.

315
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,600
That's not what happened.

316
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,910
You weren't called in front of the administartive board.

317
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,240
No, back, let's back at the bar

318
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,800
with Erica Albright.

319
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,520
She said all that? That I said that stuff to her.

320
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,670
I was reading from the transcript of her deposition.

321
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,150
Why wold you even need to depose her?

322
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,580
That's really for us to decide.

323
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,790
You think if I know she could make me look like a jerk,

324
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,540
I'll be more likely to settle.

325
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,190
Mark don't.

326
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:38,670
Why dont we stretch our legs for a minute, can we do that?

327
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,350
It's been almost 3 hours and frankly you did spend an awful lot of time

328
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:41,600
embarassing Mr.Zuckerburg

329
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,290
with the girls testimony from the bar.

330
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:47,150
I am not embarassed, she just made a lot of that up.

331
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,130
She was under Oath.

332
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,590
I guess that would be the first time someone lied under Oath.

333
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:04,590
They got 2200 hits within 2 hours.

334
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:06,380
- Thousands. - What?

335
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,710
22 thousand.

336
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,130
Those guys are really fast.

337
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,140
Is there anyway to make this a fair fight?

338
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:42,310
Jump out and swim.

339
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,950
We'd have to jump out and drown.

340
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:45,950
Or you can row forward and I can row backward.

341
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,940
We are genectically identical, science says we would stay in one place.

342
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,280
Just row the damn boat.

343
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,330
You hear about this?

344
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:02,920
What?

345
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,720
Two nights ago, a sophomore

346
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,010
choked the network with a laptop from Kirkland.

347
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,490
- Reanlly? - At four a.m..

348
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,890
He set up a website we vote the hotness of female undergrads.

349
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,520
What were we doing, that none of us heard about this.

350
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:18,360
I do not know, three-hour low-technical row before breakfast,

351
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,280
full course load studying.

352
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,800
Another three hours in the tank then studying.

353
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:23,480
I'm not sure how we missed it.

354
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,790
How much activity was on this thing?

355
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:27,420
Twenty-two thousand page requests.

356
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:29,170
Twenty-two thousand?

357
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:31,570
This guy hacked Facebook, seven houses.

358
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,090
He developed the site in one night

359
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:34,730
and he did it while he was drunk.

360
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:35,680
Twenty-two thousand.

361
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,730
How do you know he was drunk?

362
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:39,260
He was blogging, while doing this.

363
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,540
Know what I think?

364
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,790
Way ahead of you.

365
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,430
This is our guy.

366
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,930
Cameron Winklevoss,

367
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:50,380
W-I-N-K-L-E-V-O-S-S

368
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,900
Cameron spelt the usuall way.

369
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,640
Taylor Winklevoss, Taylor spelt the usuall way.

370
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,880
My last name's the same as my brother's.

371
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,670
Mr. Zuckerberg, this is an administrative board hearing.

372
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,200
violating copyright, violating individual privacy

373
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:11,070
by creating the website www.facemash.com.

374
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:13,720
You also charged with being in violation of universty policy

375
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:16,030
on distribution of digitised images.

376
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,730
Before we begin with our questioning,

377
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:20,210
your allowed to make a statement, would you like to do so?

378
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:24,190
I've...you know

379
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,390
I have already apologised in the Crimson, to the AVHW

380
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:30,550
to Harvard's Latina

381
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:33,480
and to any women at Harvard who might have been insulted, as I take it that they were'

382
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,400
As for any charges stemming from the breach of security

383
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,940
I believe I deserve some recognition from this board.

384
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,480
- I'm sorry?  - Yes.

385
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,620
I don't understand.

386
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,190
Which part?

387
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,610
You deserve recognition.

388
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,900
I believe I pointed out some pretty gaping holes in your system.

389
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,570
- Excuse me, may I? - Yes.

390
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,090
Mr. Zuckerberg, I'm in charge of security

391
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:01,060
for all computers on the Harvard network.

392
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,510
I can assure you of its sophistication

393
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,630
in fact it was that level of sophistication,

394
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,440
that led us to you in less then four hours.

395
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:08,260
Four hours?

396
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,020
Yes sir.

397
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,040
That would be impressive except if you'd known

398
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,650
what you are looking for you would seen it written on my dorm room window.

399
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:22,650
So six months academic probation.

400
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:25,310
Wow,they had to make an example out of you.

401
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,070
They had my blog.

402
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:28,500
I should have written nothing about the farm animals,

403
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:29,230
that was stupid.

404
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,500
I was kidding for gods sake doesn't anybody have a sense of humor?

405
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,260
I tried to stop you.

406
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:35,470
I know.

407
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:36,960
How do you do this thing

408
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,030
when you manage to get all girls to hate us?

409
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,230
Why do I love China? I can't do that.

410
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,190
Suppose we were given a computer

411
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:51,920
with a 16 bit virtual address, and a page size of 256 bytes.

412
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,410
The system uses a one level page table

413
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:56,970
that starts at address 0x0400.

414
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:00,450
Maybe you want DMA on your 16-bit system, who knows.

415
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,240
The first few pages are reserved for the hardware flag etc..

416
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,180
assume page-table entries have eight status bits.

417
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,650
The eight status bits will then be...

418
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:15,210
I see we have our first surrender.

419
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,810
Don't worry, Mr. Zuckerberg,

420
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,940
brighter men then you have tried and failed this class.

421
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,080
One valid bit, one modified bit,

422
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,290
one reference bit, five permission bit.

423
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,330
That is correct.

424
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,840
Does everybody see how he got there.

425
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,380
Mark?

426
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,050
You Mark Zuckerberg?

427
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:39,530
Yes.

428
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:41,400
I'm Cameron Winklevoss.

429
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:43,640
Taylor Winklevoss.

430
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,000
You guys related?

431
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,020
Good, funny never heard that before.

432
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:49,430
What can I do for you?

433
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,620
Did I insult your girlfriends?

434
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:52,640
Actually, I don't know.

435
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,590
We never asked.

436
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:54,170
We should.

437
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:55,120
Now,

438
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,640
we have an idea we want to talk to you about.

439
00:21:59,220 --> 00:21:59,910
You got a minute?

440
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:01,990
You guys look like you spent some time at the gym.

441
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:03,950
We have to.

442
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:04,540
Why?

443
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,800
We row crew.

444
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:08,840
Yeah, I've gotta minute.

445
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,270
Great.

446
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,890
Have you ever been inside the PORCILE?

447
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:16,310
No.

448
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:18,890
We can not take you passed cause your not a member.

449
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:19,730
That hurt.

450
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,490
Sandwich or something?

451
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:26,180
Uh... OK.

452
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,110
Mark, right?

453
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:27,810
Yeah.

454
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,990
Mark, this is Deweiya Narendra, our partner.

455
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:32,000
We were really impressed with "Facemash".

456
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:34,760
We checked you out. You also built "CourseMatch".

457
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,700
What is "CourseMatch"?

458
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,970
You go online and see what courses your freinds are taking.

459
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,280
Really smartness.

460
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:42,980
Mark?

461
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:43,570
Yeah?

462
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:44,930
We were talking about "CourseMatch".

463
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:48,300
Kind of a no-brainer.

464
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:50,550
You invented something in high school, right?

465
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:54,190
An apply for MP3 player, that recognises your taste in music.

466
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,720
Anybody try to buy it?

467
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,530
Microsoft.

468
00:22:59,150 --> 00:22:59,740
How much?

469
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:02,580
For free?

470
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:02,870
Yeah.

471
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:04,260
Why?

472
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:09,390
OK. Well, we have something we have been working on for a while.

473
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:11,970
We think it's great. It is called the "Harvard Connection"

474
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,770
You can create your own page, interests, bios, freinds, pics...

475
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:16,480
Then people can go online and see your bio.

476
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,700
requests...

477
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:20,210
Yeah how is that different from "My Space" and "Freindster"?

478
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,430
harvard.edu

479
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,990
harvard.edu is the most prestigious e-mail address in the country.

480
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:30,040
And all concepts based on the idea that girls...

481
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,740
Not a pretty thing, thus...

482
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,820
Girls want to only go out with guys who go to Harvard.

483
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:36,320
Me and my brother don't have trouble putting thing.

484
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,720
Main different district while we were talking about is Myspcae,

485
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,460
Friendster any of those other social networking sites.

486
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,640
It's exclusivity.

487
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:44,380
Right.

488
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:45,790
Right.

489
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:47,550
Yeah we'd love for you to work with us, Mark.

490
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,560
We need a programmer who is creative.

491
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,300
And we know who can take the initiative.

492
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:54,210
Women's groups are ready to declare a fatwa, but you know...

493
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:57,230
This could help rehabilitate your image.

494
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:59,770
Wow, you would do that for me.

495
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,770
We'd like to work with you.

496
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:06,650
Our first programmer graduated and went to work for Google.

497
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:09,210
Our second programer is got overwhelmed with school work.

498
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:11,100
We would need you to build the site,

499
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,810
write the code, we will provide...

500
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:13,170
I'm in.

501
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:15,890
What?

502
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:18,320
I'm in.

503
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:19,890
Awsome.

504
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:21,490
That's what you said?

505
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,710
It was three or four years ago, I don't know what I said.

506
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,520
When did you come to Eduardo?

507
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,300
I don't understand that question.

508
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,170
You remeber answering in the affirmative?

509
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:31,970
The affirmative.

510
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:34,670
When did you come to Eduardo with the idea for Facebook.

511
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:36,550
It was called "The Facebook" then.

512
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:38,460
This doesn't need to be that diffucult.

513
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,220
I'm currently in the middle of two different lawsuits.

514
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,490
Did you answer affirmatively?

515
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:44,290
When Taylor and Cameron Winklevoss

516
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:47,000
did in November ask you to build, "Harvard Connection,"

517
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,970
Did you say yes?

518
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,230
I said I'd help.

519
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:54,780
When did you approach Mr. Savarin with the idea for the Facebook?

520
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,350
I wouldn't say I approached him.

521
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:57,040
Sy?

522
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,600
You can answer the question.

523
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,040
At a party at Alpha Epsilon PI.

524
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,080
What's that?

525
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:03,940
Jewish Fraternity.

526
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,740
It was Caribbean night.

527
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:27,300
It's not the guys like me generally attracted to Asian girls

528
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,570
but Asian girls are generally attracted to guys like me?

529
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:32,920
I don't know if an algorithm could find the connection of you and these Asian girls.

530
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,800
I don't think it's that complicated, they're hot,

531
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,080
they're smart, they are not Jewish, they can't dance.

532
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,470
Hey Mark is here!

533
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:42,520
Mark!

534
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:57,000
I think I've come up with something...

535
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,770
Hang on, I have to tell you something you're not going to believe.

536
00:25:59,070 --> 00:25:59,600
Come on.

537
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,680
I got punched by the Phoenix.

538
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,410
- Are you kidding? - No.

539
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:07,210
It's just the first step before the process.

540
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:08,810
They send the invitation on Monday,

541
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:09,970
by door tonight.

542
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,960
That's my first punched party tommorow.

543
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,690
- You got punched by the Phoenix. - Yeah.

544
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:22,170
What did you want to talk to me about.

545
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,420
- Mark? - Yeah.

546
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,640
You said you come up with something.

547
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:28,210
Yeah I think I've came up with something. Come outside.

548
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:29,220
It's 20 degrees outside.

549
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:31,880
I can't stair at that thing Niagra Falls,

550
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,060
it has absolutely nothing to do with the Carribean.

551
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,940
- People came to "Facemash" to step in, right? - Yeah.

552
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:50,380
It wasn't because they saw pictures of hot girls,

553
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,100
you can go anywhere on the internet

554
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,290
- and see pictures of hot girls.  - Yeah.

555
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:55,670
Because they saw pictures of girls that they knew.

556
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:58,380
People want to go on the internet and check out their friends

557
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:01,490
so why not build a web site that offers them freinds, pictures, profiles

558
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:03,630
whatever you can visit browse around,

559
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:05,420
maybe someone you just met at a party.

560
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,660
I'm not talking about a dating site.

561
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:11,560
I'm talking about taking the entire social experience of college,

562
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,180
and putting it online.

563
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,550
Can't feel my legs.

564
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:15,050
I know.

565
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:17,340
- I'm totally psyched about this, Eduardo. - Yeah.

566
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:20,240
"It would be exclusive."

567
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,130
You would have to know the people on the site

568
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,310
to get past your own page, like...

569
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:25,660
getting punched.

570
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,200
That's good.

571
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,900
It's like "Final Club", except we're the president.

572
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:32,090
I told him I thought it sounded great,

573
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:34,840
It was a great idea.

574
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:37,010
There was nothing to hack,

575
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:39,360
people were gonna provide their own pictures, their own information.

576
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:41,580
And people would have the ability

577
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:44,360
to invite or not invite their friends to join.

578
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,140
In a world where social structure was everything?

579
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,540
That was the thing.

580
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:52,310
It was a big project,

581
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:55,670
and he was going to have to write tens of thousands lines of code.

582
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:58,400
So I was wondering why he was coming to me and not his roommates.

583
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,970
Dustin Moscovitz, Chris Hughes, they were programmers.

584
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,400
We're gonna need a little start up cash

585
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,680
to rent a server to get it online.

586
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,520
So that was why.

587
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,870
- Did he offer terms. - Yes.

588
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,410
We'll split it 70/30.

589
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:12,220
70 for me 30 for you for putting up the

590
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:14,690
1000 dollars and for handling everything on the business end.

591
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:15,480
You're CFO.

592
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,760
And you said...

593
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,800
I said, "Let's do it".

594
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,670
OK, did he add anything else?

595
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:21,590
Yes.

596
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,190
It probably wasn't a diversity thing.

597
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:29,940
So what.

598
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:31,940
Why you think he said that?

599
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,270
Gretchen, excuse me for interupting, whose discovery is this.

600
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:36,910
Sy, if you let me continue with my line of questioning.

601
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:39,470
They are suggesting that I was jealous of Eduardo for getting punched

602
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:42,270
by the Phoenix and began a plan to screw him out of a company that I hadn't even invent yet.

603
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:42,860
Were you?

604
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:43,150
Gretchen!

605
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:44,210
Jealous of Eduardo?

606
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:45,490
Stop typing we're all...

607
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:46,830
I know you've done your homework

608
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,500
and know money is not a big part of my life.

609
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,640
But at the moment I could buy all Auburn street,

610
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,950
take the Phoenix club and turn it into my ping-pong room.

611
00:28:57,490 --> 00:28:59,730
I'll let you know how the party is.

612
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:09,190
We recognise that you're a plaintiff in one suit involving Facebook

613
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,780
and a witness in another.

614
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:11,600
Yes, sir.

615
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,700
At any time in the weeks prior to Mark telling you his idea,

616
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,700
did he mention Tyler Winklevoss, Cameron Winklevoss,

617
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,680
Dedre Revedra or Harvard Connection?

618
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:20,350
Yes,

619
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:22,450
he said they asked him to work on their site.

620
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:23,940
But that he looked at what they had

621
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,320
and decided it wasn't worth his time.

622
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,550
He said even his most pathetic friends

623
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:30,490
knew about getting people interested

624
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:32,070
in the website than these guys.

625
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:34,040
These guys means my clients?

626
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:34,680
Yes.

627
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,030
He resented, Mark resented that they...

628
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,580
your clients thought

629
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,950
that he needed to rehabilitate his image after Facemash.

630
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,720
Mark didn't want to rehabilitate anything with Facemash.

631
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:45,810
Hacked into the Harvard computers,

632
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,220
he blew his nose at the add-board.

633
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,590
He got a lot of notoriety.

634
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:50,790
Facemash did exactly what he wanted to do.

635
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:53,820
Were you aware that while Mr. Zuckerberg was buliding the"The Facebook"

636
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,680
he was also communictaing with the plaintiffs?

637
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,410
Not at the time I wasn't, but...

638
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:02,490
It really did not have much to do with the Winklevoss dating site.

639
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:03,980
How would you know, you weren't even there.

640
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:06,520
Were you aware that while Mr. Zuckerberg

641
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,250
was building the "The Facebook",

642
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:09,420
he was leading the plaintiffs

643
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:11,250
to believe he was building the Harvard Connection.

644
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:13,260
Conclusion not found in evidence.

645
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,460
We are about to find the evidence.

646
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:19,080
Friendster  Myspace

647
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:19,860
From Mark Zujerburg to Tylor Winklevoss, November 30, 2003,

648
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:24,190
I read over all the stuff you send me related to Harvard Connection,

649
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:26,450
and it seems like it shouldn't take to long to implement,

650
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:27,570
so we can talk about it

651
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:31,100
after I get all the basic functionality up tommorrow night.

652
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:36,050
From Mark Zujerburg to Tylor Winklevoss December 1, 2003.

653
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:37,790
Sorry I was unreachable tonight.

654
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:39,700
I just got about three of your missed calls,

655
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:42,020
I was working on a problem setted for my system collapsed.

656
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:46,970
From Mark Zujerburg to Tylor and Cameron Winklevoss December 10, 2003.

657
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:48,350
this week has been pretty busy

658
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:50,260
This week has been pretty busy,between HARVARD, classes and work."

659
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,660
So I think its probably best to postpone the meeting.

660
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,070
I'm also really busy tommorow

661
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:58,310
OK anybody else feel like there is somethin up with this guy?

662
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,140
Tell him OK.

663
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:03,180
But we do have to make sure we all meet up before we go off for break.

664
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,980
I know, I know.

665
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:05,680
Yeah watch out.

666
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,310
Hey Mark...

667
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:41,650
I need a dedicated LINUX box running APACHE with------backend

668
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:43,150
Its gonna cost a little more money.

669
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:43,820
How much more.

670
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:44,930
About 200 hundred more

671
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,330
Do we need it.

672
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,620
Its gotta handle the traffic.

673
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:51,970
Do it.

674
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:52,800
I already did.

675
00:31:57,810 --> 00:31:58,730
Hey guess what

676
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:01,660
I made the secound cut.

677
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:03,650
That's good.

678
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:05,360
You should be proud of that right there,

679
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,720
dont worry if you dont make it any further.

680
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:13,600
I'll get out of here.

681
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:16,490
From Mark Zuckerburg to Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss

682
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:17,760
and Divya Narendra

683
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,810
Dec 15 2003

684
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:22,450
I have a CS problem set that I am just getting started with

685
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:26,250
And it should be about 15 hours of coding so I'll be busy tommorow night.

686
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:29,300
I wont really be free to meet until next wednesday afternoon.

687
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,870
I have to cancel Wednesday afternoon.

688
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:34,050
I've basically been in the lab this whole time.

689
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:36,080
And I also wont be able to do staurday

690
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,120
As I have to meet up with my parents.

691
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,430
As the plaque reads "John Harvard"

692
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:48,330
Founder of HARVARD UNIVERSITY in 1638.

693
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:50,330
Some call this the statue of 3 lies.

694
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,400
What are the 3 lies?

695
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,210
MR.Dowd

696
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:57,500
3 lies, first.

697
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,080
Shit

698
00:32:59,200 --> 00:32:59,920
Take yor pants off.

699
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,630
I know.

700
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:03,060
AH Mr.Savarin

701
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,700
1 - Harvard was founded in 1636.

702
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:06,790
Not 1638

703
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:09,450
2 - Hravard was not founded by John Harvard.

704
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:10,960
3 - That is not John Harvard.

705
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:11,800
Who is it.

706
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:16,610
Freind of the scupture Daniel Chester.

707
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:18,670
Keep your jacket on.

708
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:26,120
39 days after Mr.Zucermans initial meeting with my clients.

709
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,920
And he still has'nt completed work on HARVARD CONNECTION.

710
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:32,420
But on Jan 11 2004

711
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,390
Mr.Zuckerburg registered the

712
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:39,080
domain name the FACEBOOK, by network solutions.

713
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,740
To the best of your Knowledge

714
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:43,970
had he even begun work on HARVARD CONNECTION.

715
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,770
Not to my knowledge.

716
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:47,300
No

717
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,320
Hey Cameron Im still a little sceptical that we

718
00:33:57,330 --> 00:34:00,400
have enough fuctionality in the site to really draw the attention

719
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:03,790
and to gain the critical mass neccessary to get a site like this to run.

720
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:06,710
Will speak soon.

721
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,550
This is the 1st time he mentioned any problems.

722
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:12,250
Yes it was.

723
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:15,260
You sent 36 e-mails to Mr.Zuckberg

724
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:17,220
And received 16 e-mails in return

725
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:20,010
And this is the 1st time he indicated he was not happy.

726
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:20,820
That's correct.

727
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:23,700
He had 42 days to study our system and get out ahead ...

728
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,530
Do you see any of your code on Facebook,

729
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:27,580
Did I use any of your code?

730
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,630
You stole our whole godamn idea!

731
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:30,060
Fellas

732
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:33,340
- How's dot com for Harvard dize.... - Can I continue with my deposition?

733
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,780
You know you really dont need

734
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,980
a forensic team to get to the bottom of this

735
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,200
If you guys were the inventors of Facebook,

736
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,700
you invented FACEBOOK

737
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:42,980
I cant wait to stand over

738
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,730
your shoulder and watch you write us a check

739
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:45,940
Bullshit

740
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:48,990
Let's continue

741
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:53,580
February 4, 2004

742
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,360
Mark?

743
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,150
Mark?

744
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:03,370
There is a girl in your art history class named Stephanie Attis,

745
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:05,330
do you happen to know if she has a boyfreind

746
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:09,330
Have you ever seen her with anyone?

747
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:14,480
and if not, do you happen to know if she's going to go out...

748
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,180

749
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,160

754
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:12,980
Shit,it's done it it's really good

755
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,150
Clean and simple

756
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,980
No disneyland, no Live New Girls.

757
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:16,980
Watch.

758
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,430

Are you having sex or are'nt you

763
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,950
Its like people take certain classes, sit where they sit

764
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:31,710
Do what they do ... want to have some center... you know

765
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,830

00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:36,650
They're going to log on because after all the cake and watermelon there is a chance

767
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:38,100

00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:38,010
I don't know.

823
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:40,370
But I'm really hoping it's cats that looks like Hitler.

824
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:41,790
I could never get enough of that

825
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:44,790
No, it's not.

826
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:49,930
Here?

827
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,550
What?

828
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:02,800
Hey what is wrong

829
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,580
It's fine.

830
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,460
Not now

831
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,360
Need 20 minutes

832
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:33,200
OK, I just want to let you know that Zuckerberg stole our website

833
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:38,180
Mark Zuckerberg he stole our web site

834
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:41,590
It's been live for more then 36 hours

835
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:46,970
Mr. Hotchkiss

836
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:48,600
lawyer, from dad

837
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:51,780
Im here with my brother Tylor and business partner

838
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:52,690
Welcome to the "TheFacebook"

839
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,690
"TheFacebook" is an online directory

840
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:56,010
to connect with different social networks

841
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:58,920
Must have an Harvard .EDU adress to register

842
00:39:59,040 --> 00:39:59,710
That's right , yes sir

843
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:01,960
I called earlier. Im looking for Mark Zuckerberg

844
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,340
Yes, sir he actually quoted in

845
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:04,680
I read it to you

846
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,480
Everyone is talking alot about Universal FACEBOOK within HARVARD

847
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,070
I think it's kind of silly that it would

848
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:12,060
take the university a couple of years to get around to it

849
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,950
I can do a classier job then they can

850
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:14,720
and I did it.

851
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:18,100
- Tell him it's Divya Narendra called. - I don't know. That's how he talked.

852
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,550
As of yesterday evening, Zuckerberg said

853
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:24,180
that over 650 students registered to use the Facebook.Com,

854
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:27,420
He said that he anticipated 900 would join by this morning

855
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,380
Yes,he was just reading that

856
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:30,970
650 students signed up for it on the 1st day

857
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:32,560
God If I was a drug dealer,

858
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,290
I could not give free drugs to 650 people in a day

859
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:38,500
This guy doesn't have 3 freinds to rub together to make a fourth

860
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,690
All right yes thts what well do Mr.Hotchkiss

861
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:42,370
we'll put it all together and well e-mail it to you

862
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:44,370
You wont be able to go on the web site yourself

863
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:47,820
Because you dont have a ... Harvard ...

864
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,860
You know it would just be easier for us to email it to you

865
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:51,870
I'm sure You're right, he is a good guy

866
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:54,250
And hes very bright and Im sure he didnt mean to...

867
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:56,600
What he did

868
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,990
Well thank you very much and dad...

869
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:00,910
I love too.

870
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:01,900
This is a good guy?

871
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,230
We don't know that hes not a good guy

872
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:04,470
We know he stole our idea

873
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:06,290
We know he lied to our faces for a month and a half

874
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:07,420
NO.He never lied to our face

875
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:08,640
OK he never saw our faces fine.

876
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,890
He lied through our e-mail accounts

877
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:12,050
And he gave himself a 42 day head start

878
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:14,080
Because he knows and apparently you dont

879
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,870
Which is that getting there first is everything

880
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,520
I'm a competitve racer Dave I dont think you

881
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,730
need to school me on the importance of getting there first

882
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:20,190
Thank-you

883
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:20,700
All right

884
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,050
That was your father's lawyer?

885
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:22,920
He is our counsel

886
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,220
He is going to look at all this and if he

887
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:26,140
thinks its appropriate, hes going to send a cease and desist letter

888
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:26,690
Whats that gonna do

889
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:28,620
What you want to hire an IP lawyer and sue him?

890
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:31,940
No, I want to hire the SOPRANOS to beat the shit out of him with a hammer

891
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:32,680
We dont have to do that

892
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,480
Thats right

893
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,280
We can do that ourselves

894
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,500
I m 6.5 220 and theres 2 of me

895
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,620
Well whatever Im saying lets

896
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:40,070
calm down until we know what were talking about

897
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:42,290
How much more information are you waiting for

898
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:45,140
We met with Mark 3 times, we exchanged 52 e-mails

899
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:48,400
we can prove that he looked at the code what is that on the bottom of the page

900
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,580
That's Mark Zuckerberg production

901
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:50,770
On the home page?

902
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:51,770
On every page.

903
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:55,760
Shit, I need a second to let the ...

904
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,840
They wrote Zuckerberg said he hoped the privacy option would help

905
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:03,170
restore his reputation following student out rage over Facemash.Com

906
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:04,590
Exactly what we said to him

907
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:06,820
He's giving us the finger in the Crimson

908
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:08,880
While we are waiting for dads lawyer to

909
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,930
look this stuff over we can get something going in the paper

910
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:11,480
No

911
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,570
People know that this is in dispute

912
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:15,410
We're not starting a knife fight in the Crimson

913
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:17,010
We're not suing anybody.

914
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:18,410
Why not

915
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:21,900
I don't understand. Why not

916
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,650
He's gonna say stupid

917
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:26,600
Me?

918
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,220
Say it, why not?

919
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:31,680
Because we are gentlemen of Harvard

920
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,430
This is Harvard, were you

921
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:36,240
dont plant stories, and you dont sue people

922
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:39,620
You thought he was gonna be the only one that thought that was stupid?

923
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:43,070
During the time when you say you had this idea

924
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:46,620
Did you know Tylor and Cameron, came for a family of means?

925
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:48,630
A Family of means?

926
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:50,310
Did you know their father was wealthy?

927
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:53,060
I not sure why your asking me that

928
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:55,340
It's not important that you be sure why I am asking

929
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:56,320
Not important to you

930
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,310
Sy.

931
00:42:58,510 --> 00:43:00,060
Did you know that they came from money?

932
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:02,560
I had no idea weather they came from money or not

933
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,990
In one of your e-mails to Mr. Narendra,

934
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:07,940
you referenced Howard Winklevoss consulting firm

935
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:08,770
If you say so

936
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:12,830
Howard Winklevoss founded a firm whose assets are of hundreds of millions

937
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:14,940
You also knew Tyler and Cameron were

938
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:17,920
members of the Harvard final club called The Porcellian

939
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,060
You pointed that out

940
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:20,450
Excuse us for inviting you in

941
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:21,420
To the bike room

942
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:25,510
So its safe to say that you were aware that my clients had money

943
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:27,960
Yes

944
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,520
Let me tell you why I am asking,

945
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,130
I'm wondering why if you knew you needed a thousand dollars

946
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:34,710
for an internet venture you didnt ask my clients for

947
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:37,510
they had demonstrated an interest in that kind of thing.

948
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:38,550
I asked my best friend for the

949
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:40,360
money because thats who I wanted to be partners with

950
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,410
Eduardo was the President of the Harvard

951
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:44,970
Investers Association, and he was also my best friend

952
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:49,500
Your best friendis suing you for six hundred million dollars

953
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:50,940
I didnt know that tell me more

954
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:54,540
Eduardo,what happened after the initial launch?

955
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:57,230
Im Sorry Sy, would you mind adrssing him as Mr. Savarin?

956
00:43:57,230 --> 00:43:58,280
Gretchen they're best freinds

957
00:43:58,300 --> 00:43:58,950
Not anymore

958
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:00,970
We already went through this never mind ...

959
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:03,780
Mr. Savarin, what happened after the initial launch

960
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:04,760
It exploded

961
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,400
Every body on Campus was using it.

962
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,220
Facebook me,

963
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:09,730
it was a common expression after two weeks.

964
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:12,380
And Mark?

965
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:14,480
And Mark was the biggest thing on the campus?

966
00:44:14,490 --> 00:44:16,700
That included 19 Nobel laureates

967
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:17,650
and 15 Pulitzer Prize winners,

968
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:20,990
two future Olympians and a movie star.

969
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:22,360
Who is the movie star?

970
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:23,720
Does it matter?

971
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:24,720
No.

972
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,290
It was a beautiful day, and I was in my Radcliffe dorm room.

973
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,210
He brought that magzine up and he showed it to me,

974
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:40,450
and he said,"Look, it's not gonna happen without us."

975
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:42,250
We've gotta start now.

976
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:43,380
And I said,"OK."

977
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:46,120
Let's be basic out there.

978
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,980
Now most of you may be thinking the rest of the story.

979
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:49,970
Believe it or not,

980
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:51,690
At the beginning of this industry, we were very humble.

981
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:54,020
The kit computer on the cover of that magazine...

982
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:55,970
had an 8080 processor in it.

983
00:44:55,970 --> 00:44:58,750
Once you paid an extra for a 1 ? memory board,

984
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:00,370
you've got 256 Bytes.

985
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:03,250
So the challenge when I wrote Basic,

986
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:05,510
it wasn't just to run it at 4K bytes,

987
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:07,320
but, I always have to leave the room for the users

988
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,850
to run the programms, at 4K bytes.

989
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:13,120
Your friend, is that Mark Zuckerberg?

990
00:45:13,810 --> 00:45:14,390
Yeah.

991
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:15,640
He made the "Facebook"?

992
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:16,550
Yeah.

993
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:21,470
I mean, it's both of us. It's our...we're...Yeah. We...yes.

994
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:24,420
Cool. I am Christy Lee, this is Alice.

995
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:27,720
Very nice to meet you.

996
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:30,060
Facebook me when you get home.

997
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,050
Maybe we can go and grab a drink.

998
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,470
Yeah. Certainly. Absolutely.

999
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:43,680
She said, Facebook me.

1000
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,110
Then the next second is that we can all go out for a drink.

1001
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:46,260
This is so great.

1002
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:46,880
For 2 reasons.

1003
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,590
First because she said Facebook,

1004
00:45:48,590 --> 00:45:49,090
and the other,

1005
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:50,490
They want to have drinks later.

1006
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:51,770
Have you ever heard so many

1007
00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:53,900
good things packed into one regular sized sentence.

1008
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:54,830
Excuse me, Mark?

1009
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:56,600
Yeah.

1010
00:45:57,410 --> 00:45:58,730
I am Stewart Singer.

1011
00:45:58,730 --> 00:45:59,460
I'm in your OS class.

1012
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:00,580
Sure.

1013
00:46:01,330 --> 00:46:02,610
Awsome job with the Facebook.

1014
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:03,280
Awsome job.

1015
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:04,300
Thanks.

1016
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:05,180
I'm Bob.

1017
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:06,840
How are you doing?

1018
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,100
You know, I can swear he was looking at you.

1019
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:10,440
When he said "The next Bill Gates could be right in this room",

1020
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,200
I doubt it.

1021
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:14,720
I showed up late I didnt even know who the speaker was

1022
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:17,630
It was Bill Gates.

1023
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:20,530
Sure, that makes sense.

1024
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:23,570
Alright, thanks guys.

1025
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:28,150
Are you a moron?

1026
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:38,030
Time to monetize the thing.

1027
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:39,110
What were their names?

1028
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,280
You hear what I just said?

1029
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,280
What?

1030
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:43,280
I said it's time to monetize the site.

1031
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:45,380
What does that mean?

1032
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:48,320
It means, its time for the web site to start generate revenue.

1033
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,370
I know the word, I am asking how you want to do it.

1034
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:52,600
Advertising.

1035
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:53,680
No.

1036
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:56,580
Well we got 4000 members.

1037
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:57,800
Because Facebook is a cool,

1038
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,130
And if we start selling pop-ups for Mountain Dew...

1039
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:01,600
Well I wasn't thinking Mountain Dew,

1040
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:04,640
but at some point I am talking as the business end of the company.

1041
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:07,390
We don't even know what it is yet.

1042
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:08,360
We don't know what it is.

1043
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,590
We dont know what it can be,

1044
00:47:09,590 --> 00:47:11,830
We don't know what it will be, we know that it's just cool.

1045
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:14,790
that is a priceless assets I'm not giving up.

1046
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:15,840
So when will it be finished?

1047
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:16,850
It won't be finished.

1048
00:47:16,970 --> 00:47:19,130
That's the point, the way fashions never finishes.

1049
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:19,740
Fashion,

1050
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:20,940
fashion is never finished.

1051
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:22,730
You're talking about fashion? Really, you...

1052
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:25,410
I'm talking about the idea and I'm saying that it's never finished.

1053
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:28,510
OK, they manage to make money selling pants.

1054
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:31,300
Mark, what is this?

1055
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:32,280
A what?

1056
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:33,040
This.

1057
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:34,880
It's called a Cease and Desist letter.

1058
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:35,580
What were their names?

1059
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:35,980
Who?

1060
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:36,510
The girls.

1061
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:37,530
When did you get this?

1062
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:40,000
About ten days ago, right after we launched the site.

1063
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:40,980
Jesus Christ!

1064
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:41,660
Hey, the girls,

1065
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:42,300
what were their names?

1066
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:43,380
They're saying the Winklevoss twins,

1067
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:45,490
are saying that you stole their ideas.

1068
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:47,650
I find that to be a little more than mildly annoying.

1069
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:50,060
They find it to be intellectual property theft.

1070
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:52,600
Why didn't you show this to me?

1071
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:53,960
It was adressed to me.

1072
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:55,110
They're saying that we stole the

1073
00:47:55,110 --> 00:47:57,460
Facebook from David Neandra and the Winklevoss twins.

1074
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:58,060
I know what it says.

1075
00:47:58,180 --> 00:47:58,730
Did we?

1076
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:00,390
Did we what?

1077
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:01,340
Don't screw around with me now.

1078
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:02,260
Look at me.

1079
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,410
The letter says we could face legal action.

1080
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:06,170
No, it says I could face legal action.

1081
00:48:06,170 --> 00:48:07,590
This is from a lawyer, Mark,

1082
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:08,580
they must feel they have some grounds.

1083
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:10,800
The lawyer is their father's house counsel.

1084
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:11,360
Do they have grounds?

1085
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:12,750
The grounds are our thing is cool and popular,

1086
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:14,560
and "Harvard Connection" is lame.

1087
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,380
Eduardo I didn't use any of their code,

1088
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:18,240
I promise I didn't use anything.

1089
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,530
Look, a guy who builds a nice chair,

1090
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:21,570
doesn't owe money to everyone who has ever built a chair.

1091
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:22,960
Look, they came to me with an idea...

1092
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:23,810
I had a better one.

1093
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:24,960
Why didn't you show me this letter?

1094
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,120
I didn't think it was a big deal.

1095
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,430
Is there something wrong?

1096
00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:35,740
If there's ever anything wrong,

1097
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:37,040
you can tell me.

1098
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:38,410
I'm the guy that wants to help.

1099
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:39,610
This is our thing.

1100
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:43,350
Now is there anything that you need to tell me?

1101
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:44,150
No.

1102
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:49,650
What are we doing about this?

1103
00:48:49,650 --> 00:48:51,410
I went to 3L Student Legal Services,

1104
00:48:51,410 --> 00:48:53,130
and they told me to write them back.

1105
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:54,080
And what did you say?

1106
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,900
When we met in January,

1107
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:57,450
I expressed my doubts about the site.

1108
00:48:57,450 --> 00:48:58,850
Where it stood with graphics.

1109
00:48:58,850 --> 00:49:01,160
How much programming was left that I had not anticipated.

1110
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,480
Lack of hardware, we had website use and promotion,

1111
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:06,800
and the to go on to successfuly launch the web site.

1112
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:10,680
This is your first time, you raised any of those concerns, right?

1113
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,150
I raised concerns before.

1114
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:13,140
Bullshit.

1115
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:14,390
That's all gentlemen.

1116
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:15,850
I'm talking about the meeting in January

1117
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:18,080
to which this letter is refering.

1118
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:18,630
Yeah.

1119
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:20,350
Let me rephrase this,

1120
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:23,120
you sent my client sent 16 e-mails.

1121
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:25,880
The first 15, you didn't raise any concerns.

1122
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,020
Is that a question?

1123
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:30,600
In the 16th email you raised concerns about site functionality.

1124
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,100
Were you leading them on for six weeks?

1125
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:33,470
No.

1126
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:36,440
Then why didn't you raise any of these concerns before ...

1127
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:37,660
It's raining.

1128
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:38,490
I'm sorry.

1129
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:39,510
It just started raining.

1130
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:42,790
Mr. Zuckerberg, do I have your full attention?

1131
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:44,630
No.

1132
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:47,450
Do you think I deserve it?

1133
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:48,560
What?

1134
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:50,960
Do you think I deserve your full attention?

1135
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:53,620
I had to swear an oath before I began this deposition

1136
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:55,740
and I don't want to perjure myself.

1137
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:57,540
So I have a legal obligation to say no.

1138
00:49:58,090 --> 00:49:58,690
OK no.

1139
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:01,600
You don't think I deserve your attention.

1140
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:03,420
I think if your clients want to sit on my shoulders

1141
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,440
and call themselves tall, they have a right to.

1142
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,680
But there is no requirement

1143
00:50:06,690 --> 00:50:09,040
that I enjoy sitting here, listening to people lie.

1144
00:50:09,470 --> 00:50:12,860
You have part of my attention, you have the minimum amount.

1145
00:50:13,590 --> 00:50:16,170
The rest of my attention is back at the offices of Facebook.

1146
00:50:16,290 --> 00:50:17,710
When my colleagues and I were doing things,

1147
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:19,920
that no one in this room including and especially your clients,

1148
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,400
are intellectually or creatively capable of doing.

1149
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:27,490
Does that adequately answer your condescending question?

1150
00:50:34,530 --> 00:50:38,070
I have 12:45, why don't we say that's lunch.

1151
00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:40,820
Back at two thirty.

1152
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:43,800
So, what were their names?

1153
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:48,030
Their names were Christy and Alice.

1154
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,310
And they want to have drinks tonight.

1155
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:21,720
I don't care.

1156
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:48,120
Hey man sorry, a couple of girls are freshening up in there.

1157
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:50,030
Ok.

1158
00:51:54,870 --> 00:51:56,020
We have groupies.

1159
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:06,060
I'll be right back.

1160
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:07,030
Where are you going?

1161
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:13,980
Erika?

1162
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:17,100
Hi.

1163
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:19,240
I saw you from over there, I didn't know you came to this pub.

1164
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:20,970
First time.

1165
00:52:20,970 --> 00:52:23,830
Mine too, can I talk to you alone for a second?

1166
00:52:25,110 --> 00:52:26,560
I think I'm good right here.

1167
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,180
I just...

1168
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:29,550
I love to talk to you alone.

1169
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:30,370
If we could talk outside...

1170
00:52:30,490 --> 00:52:31,290
Right here is fine.

1171
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,510
I don't know if you heard about this new website I launched?

1172
00:52:34,630 --> 00:52:35,480
No.

1173
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:36,920
The Facebook?

1174
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,010
You called me bitch on the internet, Mark.

1175
00:52:39,010 --> 00:52:40,800
That's why I wanted to talk to you.

1176
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:41,780
On the internet

1177
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:43,360
That is why I came over.

1178
00:52:43,370 --> 00:52:45,100
Comparing women to farm animals?

1179
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:46,760
I didn't end up doing that.

1180
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,540
Didn't stop you from writing it.

1181
00:52:48,850 --> 00:52:49,890
It's as if every thought

1182
00:52:49,890 --> 00:52:51,850
that tumbles through your head is so clever,

1183
00:52:51,850 --> 00:52:53,740
it would be a crime for it not to be shared.

1184
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:57,220
The internets not written in pencil, Mark.

1185
00:52:57,220 --> 00:52:58,060
It's written in ink.

1186
00:52:58,060 --> 00:53:00,910
And you published that "Erika Albright" is a bitch.

1187
00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:04,070
Right before you made an ignorant crack about my families name,

1188
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:07,370
and bra size, and then rated women based on their hotness.

1189
00:53:07,490 --> 00:53:09,470
Erika, is there a problem?

1190
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:10,580
No, there's no problem.

1191
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:13,830
You write your snide bullshit from a dark room,

1192
00:53:13,950 --> 00:53:16,030
because of what's the angry doing nowadays.

1193
00:53:17,370 --> 00:53:18,470
I was nice to you.

1194
00:53:18,810 --> 00:53:20,140
Don't torture me for it.

1195
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:21,720
If we could just go somewhere for a minute.

1196
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:23,020
I do not want to be rude to my friends.

1197
00:53:25,810 --> 00:53:26,430
Ok.

1198
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:30,260
Good luck with your video games.

1199
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:31,940
Yeah, that was great.

1200
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:33,950
That was the right thing to do to apologize, right?

1201
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:38,340
We have to expand,

1202
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:39,620
Tommorow.

1203
00:53:42,070 --> 00:53:43,480
Is he mad about something?

1204
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,560
OK, we are expanding to Yale and Columbia.

1205
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:49,500
Dustin, I want you to share the coding work with me.

1206
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:50,940
Chris, you are in charge of publicity and outreach,

1207
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:52,030
and you can start by getting us a story

1208
00:53:52,030 --> 00:53:53,130
in the B.U. Student Newspaper.

1209
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:53,820
The Bridge.

1210
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:55,800
They hate doing stories about Harvard.

1211
00:53:55,810 --> 00:53:56,650
Somebody at the newspaper

1212
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:58,050
will be a computer science major, tell him

1213
00:53:58,050 --> 00:53:59,960
Mark Zuckerberg will do ten hours of free programming.

1214
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,820
Why do you want a story in the BU newspaper?

1215
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:02,570
Because I do.

1216
00:54:02,570 --> 00:54:03,360
Now here's the arrangement.

1217
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:05,450
Eduardo is CFO, owns 30% of the company.

1218
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:07,420
Dustin is a vice president and head of programming,

1219
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:09,310
and his 5% of the company will come from my end.

1220
00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:11,300
Chris is director of publicity, and his compensation

1221
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:13,710
will depend on the amount of work he ends up doing.

1222
00:54:14,130 --> 00:54:14,700
Any questions?

1223
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:15,330
Who are these girls?

1224
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:18,080
Sorry, they are Christy and Alice.

1225
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:18,930
Hi.

1226
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:19,550
Hi.

1227
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:20,230
Hello.

1228
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:20,780
Hi.

1229
00:54:21,770 --> 00:54:22,700
Is there anything we can do?

1230
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:23,700
No.

1231
00:54:23,710 --> 00:54:24,350
Nothing.

1232
00:54:24,350 --> 00:54:25,330
Yale and Columbia.

1233
00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:26,570
And Stanford.

1234
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:27,900
What?

1235
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:28,570
Stanford.

1236
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:31,400
It is time for them to see us from Palo Alto.

1237
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:38,750
You don't want any lunch?

1238
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:39,460
No.

1239
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:42,330
You're welcome to some salad.

1240
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:43,060
No, thank you.

1241
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:51,500
This must be hard.

1242
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:53,750
Who are you?

1243
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,790
I'm Marilyn Delpei,

1244
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:56,590
I introduced myself...

1245
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:58,170
I mean what do you do?

1246
00:54:58,290 --> 00:55:00,610
I am a secoud-year associate at the firm.

1247
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:02,800
My boss wanted me to sit in on the deposition case.

1248
00:55:04,910 --> 00:55:05,650
What are you doing?

1249
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:08,670
Checking to see how its going in Bosnia.

1250
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,090
Bosnia.

1251
00:55:10,670 --> 00:55:12,320
Ther don't have roads but they have Facebook?

1252
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:21,910
You must really hate the Winklevoss's?

1253
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,480
I don't hate anybody.

1254
00:55:24,790 --> 00:55:28,040
The Winklevoss are sueing me for intellectual property theft.

1255
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:30,380
They're sueing me because for the first time in their lives,

1256
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:32,940
things didn't work out the way they were supposed to for them.

1257
00:55:40,930 --> 00:55:42,140
He is expanding.

1258
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:43,430
What?

1259
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:45,160
He is expanding to Yale, Columbia and Stanford,

1260
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:46,030
it's gonna be in the Crimson tommorow.

1261
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:47,080
Really?

1262
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:47,880
Yeah.

1263
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:49,140
Well, it looked like the Cease and Desist order

1264
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:51,000
really scared the shit out of him, huh.

1265
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:52,160
I want to hire a lawyer

1266
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:53,980
to file for injuctive relief, the site taken down now.

1267
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:55,200
Every minute the site is up,

1268
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,180
Harvard Connection becomes less valuable.

1269
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:59,320
I want an injuction, I want damages,

1270
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:00,130
I want punitive release.

1271
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:01,030
I want him dead.

1272
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:02,160
Yeah I want those things, too.

1273
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:03,760
Then why aren't we doing anything about it.

1274
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,170
Because we are gentlemen at Harvard?

1275
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:06,510
Because you're not thinking about how it's gonna look.

1276
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:07,480
How's it gonna look?

1277
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:09,130
Like my brother and I are in skeleton costumes

1278
00:56:09,130 --> 00:56:11,630
chasing the karate kid around a high school gym.

1279
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:13,280
Cam.

1280
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:15,420
He has violated Massachusets state law.

1281
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:16,700
He goes to Connecticut, New York,

1282
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:18,540
and to California, he will have violated Federal Law.

1283
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:20,930
By the way he's in violation of Harvard law.

1284
00:56:21,350 --> 00:56:22,840
There's no such thing as Harvard law.

1285
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:23,890
Yeah.

1286
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:25,750
There is.

1287
00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:31,070
Harvard student hand book.

1288
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:33,020
Every freshman is issued one of these.

1289
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:34,080
Some where in this book,

1290
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:35,850
it says you can't steal from another student.

1291
00:56:37,970 --> 00:56:38,800
This is what we need.

1292
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:39,800
We're going to Summers.

1293
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:42,070
You can't get a meeting with Larry Summers.

1294
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:43,660
My brother and I, we pay tuition at this school.

1295
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:45,660
We carry a 3.9 GPA in this school.

1296
00:56:45,890 --> 00:56:46,900
We won trophys for this school,

1297
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:49,210
and will be rowing in the Olympics for this school.

1298
00:56:49,330 --> 00:56:51,490
I want a meeting with the godamn president of this school.

1299
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:53,940
Why Stanford?

1300
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:56,250
Why do you think...

1301
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,180
Sorry,

1302
00:57:02,190 --> 00:57:03,540
I'm late for Bio-Chem.

1303
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:05,830
Ok.

1304
00:57:09,130 --> 00:57:10,380
You don't know my name, do you?

1305
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,310
Is it Stanford?

1306
00:57:13,010 --> 00:57:14,650
I should just kick your ass.

1307
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:16,410
How do you go to a party?

1308
00:57:16,530 --> 00:57:17,990
Amelia Ritter.

1309
00:57:18,110 --> 00:57:19,460
but you prefer Amy

1310
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:20,770
You from Olinda

1311
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:23,870
Your fathers in commercial real estate and your mothers never sober.

1312
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:25,230
What's my major?

1313
00:57:25,930 --> 00:57:26,890
Trombone.

1314
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:27,640
Really.

1315
00:57:27,930 --> 00:57:30,150
I don't know there's something about a trombone.

1316
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:34,550
French.

1317
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:36,310
Your major's French.

1318
00:57:37,210 --> 00:57:38,790
Mine?  I don't have one.

1319
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:40,230
Not picking a major?

1320
00:57:41,690 --> 00:57:42,690
I don't go to school.

1321
00:57:42,950 --> 00:57:43,530
You kidding

1322
00:57:43,650 --> 00:57:44,210
No.

1323
00:57:45,810 --> 00:57:46,990
Where did you go to school?

1324
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:48,880
William Taft Elementary.

1325
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:49,730
For a little while.

1326
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:50,660
Seriously.

1327
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:53,710
You're not like 15 years old or anything are you?

1328
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,470
You're not like 15 are you?

1329
00:57:57,590 --> 00:57:58,050
No.

1330
00:58:00,070 --> 00:58:00,710
So what do you do?

1331
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:03,720
I am an entrepreneur

1332
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:05,830
Your unemployed.

1333
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:06,800
I wouldn't say that

1334
00:58:07,130 --> 00:58:07,920
What would you say

1335
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:09,310
That I'm an entrepreneur.

1336
00:58:09,550 --> 00:58:11,180
Well, then what was your entrepreneur?

1337
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:13,050
Well I founded an Interent company.

1338
00:58:13,050 --> 00:58:15,580
that lets folks download and share music for free

1339
00:58:16,050 --> 00:58:17,000
Kind of like Napster?

1340
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:18,680
Exactly like Napster.

1341
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:19,610
What do you mean?

1342
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:21,930
I founded Napster.

1343
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:24,050
Sean Parker founded Napster.

1344
00:58:24,170 --> 00:58:25,210
Nice to meet you.

1345
00:58:25,910 --> 00:58:26,890
You're Sean Parker?

1346
00:58:26,890 --> 00:58:29,050
UH HUH you see the shoes on the other.

1347
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:29,910
foot.

1348
00:58:30,030 --> 00:58:30,450
table.

1349
00:58:32,850 --> 00:58:34,170
I just slept with Sean Parker?

1350
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:36,290
You just slept on Sean Parker?

1351
00:58:36,610 --> 00:58:37,720
You're a billionaire

1352
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:38,760
Not technically.

1353
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:39,510
What are you?

1354
00:58:40,810 --> 00:58:41,550
Broke.

1355
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:43,320
There's not a lot of money in free music

1356
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:45,760
and even less if your being sued by anyone whos won a grammy.

1357
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:47,720
This is blowing my mind.

1358
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:48,870
I appreciate that.

1359
00:58:48,870 --> 00:58:50,770
I gotta hop in the shower and get ready for class

1360
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:54,630
Even though your a french major whose name is Amy.

1361
00:58:54,630 --> 00:58:55,730
You passed.

1362
00:58:56,340 --> 00:58:57,370
I'm a hard worker.

1363
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,740
There's juice there's anything else you can find, help yourself

1364
00:59:03,270 --> 00:59:04,280
Mind if I check my e-mail

1365
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:05,630
Yeah go ahead

1366
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:21,180
Amy Amy

1367
00:59:21,990 --> 00:59:24,870
- Can you come out here?  - Just a second.

1368
00:59:28,270 --> 00:59:30,060
There's a snake in here, Amy.

1369
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:34,210
What? Where

1370
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:35,920
OK there is no snake but I need to ask you something.

1371
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:38,390
Are you kidding me I could have been killed.

1372
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:38,930
How

1373
00:59:39,050 --> 00:59:43,480
By running too fast and getting twisted in the curtain.

1374
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:44,600
What do you need to ask me?

1375
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:45,660
I went to check my e-mail

1376
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:47,430
and theres a website open on your computer

1377
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:52,690
Yeah after you passed out last night I went on the Facebook for a bit.

1378
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:53,220
What's that?

1379
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:54,220
The Facebook?

1380
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:57,330
Stanford'S had it for like 2 weeks now

1381
00:59:57,330 --> 01:00:00,710
It's really awsome, freakishly addictive.

1382
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:03,440
Seriously I'm on the thing like 5 times a day.

1383
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,830
Mind if I send myself an e-mail

1384
01:00:04,830 --> 01:00:06,470
Yeah is everything okay

1385
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:07,590
Everything's great

1386
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:13,670
I just need to find you Mark Zuckerberg

1387
01:00:17,210 --> 01:00:18,720
Ever been in this building before

1388
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:21,760
This buildings a hundred years older then the country its in.

1389
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:23,300
So do be careful

1390
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:26,220
Were sitting in chairs.

1391
01:00:27,150 --> 01:00:27,600
Yes

1392
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:29,810
Very good

1393
01:00:30,230 --> 01:00:31,840
You can go in now

1394
01:00:43,330 --> 01:00:45,240
Catherine, I've got students now,

1395
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:47,510
students undergraduates

1396
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:49,480
don't know,from the looks of

1397
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:51,660
it they want to sell me a Brooks Brothers suit.

1398
01:00:53,890 --> 01:00:54,360
Good morning

1399
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:55,050
Good morning, sir

1400
01:00:55,050 --> 01:00:56,820
I'm Cameron Winklevoss, this is my brother Tyle.

1401
01:00:56,830 --> 01:00:58,880
Are you here because?

1402
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:03,090
I'm sorry sir, I thought you were reading the letter.

1403
01:01:03,090 --> 01:01:04,000
Read the letter.

1404
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:06,310
Well, we came up with an idea

1405
01:01:06,310 --> 01:01:07,630
for a website called "Harvard Connection"

1406
01:01:07,630 --> 01:01:09,810
we've since changed the name to CONNECTU.

1407
01:01:09,930 --> 01:01:11,480
And Mark Zuckerberg stole that idea and

1408
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:12,090
I understand

1409
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:14,500
and I'm asking what you want me to do about it?

1410
01:01:14,890 --> 01:01:15,590
Well, sir

1411
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:19,130
In the HARVARD student handbook which is distributed to each freshman

1412
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:21,810
Under the heading standars of conduct in the HARVARD community

1413
01:01:21,930 --> 01:01:24,500
it says the college expects all the students to be honest

1414
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:27,220
and forthcoming in their dealings with members in the community

1415
01:01:27,690 --> 01:01:30,810
stundents are required to respect public and private ownership

1416
01:01:30,930 --> 01:01:33,050
and instances of theft, missappropriation...

1417
01:01:33,050 --> 01:01:33,540
Anne?

1418
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:34,350
Yes sir?

1419
01:01:34,470 --> 01:01:36,240
Punch me in the face, go ahead.

1420
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:39,980
or

1421
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:43,380
or unauthorised use will result in disciplinary action

1422
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:45,450
including required withdrawl from the college.

1423
01:01:45,450 --> 01:01:47,580
You memorised that instead of doing what

1424
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:50,980
What my brother came and I came here to ask you respectfully

1425
01:01:50,990 --> 01:01:53,700
Sir its against university rules to steal from other students

1426
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:54,530
plain and simple

1427
01:01:54,530 --> 01:01:55,580
Have you spoken to your housemaster?

1428
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:56,300
Yes sir.

1429
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:59,900
And the housemaster made a recommendation to the AD BOARD but the AD BOARD wont hear us.

1430
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:01,560
Have you tried dealing with the other student directly?

1431
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:04,140
Mr. Zuckerburg hasn't been responding

1432
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:05,820
to any of our e-mails and phone calls for the last 2 weeks.

1433
01:02:05,830 --> 01:02:07,890
he doesnt answer when we knock on his door at KIRKLAND

1434
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:09,670
and the closest I've come to dealing with him face to face

1435
01:02:09,670 --> 01:02:12,110
when I saw him on the quad and chased him through HARVARD SQUARE.

1436
01:02:12,110 --> 01:02:12,610
chased him?

1437
01:02:12,610 --> 01:02:14,550
I I I saw him and I know he saw me,

1438
01:02:14,550 --> 01:02:15,040
I went after him

1439
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:16,220
and he disapeaared.

1440
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:18,480
I don't see this as a universty issue.

1441
01:02:18,490 --> 01:02:20,110
Of course it's a a universty issue.

1442
01:02:20,230 --> 01:02:21,060
There's a code of ethics

1443
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:22,610
and an honor code and he violated them both.

1444
01:02:22,610 --> 01:02:24,780
you entered into a code of ethics with the university.

1445
01:02:25,090 --> 01:02:26,250
not with each other.

1446
01:02:26,370 --> 01:02:27,860
I'm sorry President Summers.

1447
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:30,510
What you just said makes no sense to me at all.

1448
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:31,310
I'm devestated by that.

1449
01:02:31,310 --> 01:02:32,600
What my brother means is

1450
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:35,300
Mark Zuckerburg walked into our dorm room and stole our computer.

1451
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:36,770
That would be a universty issue.

1452
01:02:36,770 --> 01:02:38,990
I don't know, this office doesn't handle petty larceny.

1453
01:02:38,990 --> 01:02:40,150
This isnt petty larceny.

1454
01:02:40,150 --> 01:02:42,480
This idea is potentialy worth millions of dollars.

1455
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:43,080
Millions?

1456
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:43,730
Yes.

1457
01:02:43,730 --> 01:02:46,080
You might just be letting your imaginations run away with you.

1458
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:46,670
Sir

1459
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:49,240
I honestly don't think your in any position to make that call

1460
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:51,150
I was the US Treasury Secretary.

1461
01:02:51,270 --> 01:02:53,090
I'm in some position to make that call.

1462
01:02:53,090 --> 01:02:55,230
"Letting our imagnations run away with us "

1463
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:57,370
Is exactly what we were told to do in your Freshaman address?

1464
01:02:57,380 --> 01:03:00,040
well then I would suggest that you let your imaginations

1465
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:01,580
run away with you on a new project.

1466
01:03:01,590 --> 01:03:02,060
You would?

1467
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:04,450
everyone at HARVARD is inventing something

1468
01:03:04,570 --> 01:03:06,520
HARVARD undergarduates believe that inventing

1469
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:09,260
a job is better then finding a job.

1470
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:10,500
So I suggest again that

1471
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:12,820
the 2 of you come up with a new new project.

1472
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:14,620
I'm sorry, sir. But thats not the point

1473
01:03:14,620 --> 01:03:15,090
Please

1474
01:03:15,090 --> 01:03:16,180
come right at the point.

1475
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:18,180
You don't have to be a intellectual property expert

1476
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:19,870
to understand the difference between right and wrong.

1477
01:03:19,990 --> 01:03:21,220
You're saying that I don't?

1478
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:22,570
Of course I am not saying that sir.

1479
01:03:22,690 --> 01:03:23,180
I'm saying that.

1480
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:24,490
Really?

1481
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:26,010
Ann

1482
01:03:26,130 --> 01:03:27,430
How did I get this appointment?

1483
01:03:27,430 --> 01:03:28,790
Colleagues of their father

1484
01:03:30,870 --> 01:03:33,420
Let me tell you something, Mr. Winklevoss, Mr. Winklevoss.

1485
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:35,490
Since your on the subject of right and wrong

1486
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:37,430
This action, this meeting

1487
01:03:37,430 --> 01:03:40,170
The 2 of you being here, is wrong

1488
01:03:40,290 --> 01:03:41,610
It's not worthy of Harvard,

1489
01:03:41,730 --> 01:03:43,730
it's not what Harvard saw in you.

1490
01:03:43,730 --> 01:03:46,020
You don't get special treatment.

1491
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:47,090
We never asked ...

1492
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:48,660
Wai ...Wai..Start another project

1493
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:51,100
Like were amking a diorama for a science fair

1494
01:03:51,110 --> 01:03:52,010
If you have a problem with that Mr WinkleVoss

1495
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:53,750
We never asked for special treatment.

1496
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:55,770
The courts allways at your disposal.

1497
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:57,600
Is there anything else I can do for you.

1498
01:03:58,950 --> 01:03:59,490
Ty.

1499
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:01,990
Thank you very much for your time.

1500
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:11,240
I broke a 335 year old door knob.

1501
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:14,890
Eduardo, spring break you

1502
01:04:14,890 --> 01:04:16,850
and Mr. Zuckerburg took a trip to New York.

1503
01:04:16,970 --> 01:04:17,350
Yes.

1504
01:04:17,470 --> 01:04:18,690
What was the purpose of the trip?

1505
01:04:19,620 --> 01:04:24,010
Well, as CFO I set up some meetings with potential advertisers.

1506
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:25,260
Who paid for the trip?

1507
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:28,480
It was paid for out of the thousand dollar account I set up a few months earlier.

1508
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:30,400
At this point your thousand dollars

1509
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,330
was the only money that had been put into the company.

1510
01:04:32,330 --> 01:04:32,960
Yes.

1511
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:34,320
How did you feel the meetings went?

1512
01:04:35,890 --> 01:04:36,600
Went terribly.

1513
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:37,370
Why?

1514
01:04:37,820 --> 01:04:38,820
Mark was asleep.

1515
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:40,230
I was not asleep.

1516
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:42,240
Can I repharse my answer?

1517
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:43,970
I wish he was asleep.

1518
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,820
So were at 29 schools now with over 75000 members.

1519
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:53,630
People who go on the Facebook tend to stay on longer

1520
01:04:53,630 --> 01:04:55,580
than almost any other web site.

1521
01:04:55,580 --> 01:04:56,840
Now heres the most impressive statistc.

1522
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:59,150
91% of the people who try it once

1523
01:04:59,150 --> 01:05:00,900
come back. Now if you'll allow me

1524
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:01,880
Excuse me one second

1525
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:04,130
What sound is he making, is that like a tick?

1526
01:05:07,450 --> 01:05:08,750
Was'nt a tick

1527
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:09,980
Was

1528
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:12,780
Like throttle sound.

1529
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:15,390
Almost a gag reflex

1530
01:05:17,350 --> 01:05:18,260
What is this ...

1531
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:21,580
There was 1 more meeting scheduled for the New York.

1532
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:23,110
Yes, it was a dinner.

1533
01:05:23,230 --> 01:05:24,780
It was set up through my girlfriend at the time.

1534
01:05:24,790 --> 01:05:27,380
Would you say that Mark was excited about this meeting

1535
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:28,680
Yes.

1536
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:30,220
Very.

1537
01:05:30,220 --> 01:05:32,220
Their not gonna card us here right

1538
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:32,930
Look around

1539
01:05:33,050 --> 01:05:33,780
Don't be embarrassed

1540
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:35,870
Tell him their not gonna card us.

1541
01:05:35,990 --> 01:05:37,350
Their not gonna card us.

1542
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:37,730
Mark

1543
01:05:37,730 --> 01:05:39,150
Are you gonna talk about adds again.

1544
01:05:39,150 --> 01:05:41,130
Unless your the BALLET THEATRE of HARTFORD,

1545
01:05:41,130 --> 01:05:43,110
the purpose of business is to make a profit.

1546
01:05:43,110 --> 01:05:44,380
It isn't a business yet.

1547
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:46,910
That's...that's tough for me , Its my job.

1548
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:48,310
Never mind

1549
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:52,560
25 minutes late.

1550
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:54,660
He started Napster, when he was 19.

1551
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:55,360
He can be late.

1552
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:56,140
He is not a God.

1553
01:05:56,140 --> 01:05:57,030
What is he?

1554
01:05:57,030 --> 01:05:58,630
He's 25 minutes late.

1555
01:05:58,630 --> 01:06:00,060
I think you're not jealous

1556
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:01,880
I honestly wasn't jealous.

1557
01:06:02,490 --> 01:06:03,520
I was nervous.

1558
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:04,300
Why?

1559
01:06:04,590 --> 01:06:05,660
I didn't know him at all.

1560
01:06:05,780 --> 01:06:09,370
But I had done a search and asked around and he

1561
01:06:09,490 --> 01:06:12,050
He struck me as a kind of an....

1562
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:14,850
Wildcard.

1563
01:06:14,970 --> 01:06:15,840
Why?

1564
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:18,290
He crashed out of 2 pretty big Internet companies

1565
01:06:18,290 --> 01:06:21,060
in spectacular fashion and hes got a reputation with drugs.

1566
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:22,500
He also founded the companies.

1567
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:23,800
We don't need him.

1568
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:25,860
He's here.

1569
01:06:35,010 --> 01:06:35,860
I'm Sean Parker.

1570
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:36,410
How do you do.

1571
01:06:36,410 --> 01:06:37,090
You must be Eduardo.

1572
01:06:37,090 --> 01:06:39,050
and Christy, and Mark.

1573
01:06:39,050 --> 01:06:39,590
Great to meet you.

1574
01:06:41,370 --> 01:06:42,790
You guys don't have anything in front of you.

1575
01:06:42,910 --> 01:06:43,260
No.

1576
01:06:43,580 --> 01:06:44,140
Tori

1577
01:06:45,010 --> 01:06:45,640
Hee, baby boy.

1578
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:47,190
Could you bring out somethings.

1579
01:06:47,190 --> 01:06:49,300
The laquered pork with that ginger confit

1580
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:52,280
Tuna tartar , and the lobster claws, that'll get us started.

1581
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:53,010
Christy

1582
01:06:53,010 --> 01:06:54,010
What do you like to drink?

1583
01:06:55,850 --> 01:06:56,620
An Appletini.

1584
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:57,750
Great.

1585
01:06:58,050 --> 01:06:59,320
4 of those.

1586
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:02,450
From that point on it was a show of Sean.

1587
01:07:11,030 --> 01:07:13,700
The question was what did you talk about.

1588
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:27,850
He took through his episode with NAPSTER.

1589
01:07:27,850 --> 01:07:30,700
I didn't want to spend my 20's as a professinal defender.

1590
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:33,610
Who knew that in the begining of 2003--

1591
01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:36,130
They tried to sell the company to pay the 35 million

1592
01:07:36,130 --> 01:07:37,890
they said we owed in royalties

1593
01:07:37,890 --> 01:07:39,490
but I guess to them that was a little like

1594
01:07:40,110 --> 01:07:42,440
Selling a stolen car to pay for the stolen gas.

1595
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:44,180
So we said screw it

1596
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:45,250
and declared bankruptcy.

1597
01:07:45,250 --> 01:07:46,300
You made a name for yourself.

1598
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:47,850
And you are dry.

1599
01:07:47,970 --> 01:07:49,010
Tory

1600
01:07:49,430 --> 01:07:52,230
And then he went on to his secound business venture

1601
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:53,820
which was an online rolodex

1602
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:55,990
that he got thrown out of by his equity

1603
01:07:56,110 --> 01:07:58,460
And I wanted to do it nicely, I put on a tie

1604
01:07:58,460 --> 01:08:01,880
and shined my shoes, but nobody wanted to take orders from a kid.

1605
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:02,830
So let me tell you what

1606
01:08:02,830 --> 01:08:03,720
what happened through a 20 year old

1607
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:04,800
to the top of that dot-com.

1608
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:06,490
I'm not a psychiatrist,but...

1609
01:08:06,610 --> 01:08:08,060
We got that on the record.

1610
01:08:08,180 --> 01:08:10,120
You're not a psychiatrist, but what?

1611
01:08:10,430 --> 01:08:13,260
A psychiatrist would say that he was paranoid.

1612
01:08:13,270 --> 01:08:15,790
They hired private detectives who followed you day and night.

1613
01:08:15,790 --> 01:08:18,060
You were target for high priced escorts.

1614
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:20,520
I can't prove it but I know they tapped my phone,

1615
01:08:20,530 --> 01:08:23,120
so whatever it is I'm gonna trip you up. You've done already.

1616
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:25,980
Private behaviour is a relic of a time gone by,

1617
01:08:25,980 --> 01:08:27,020
and somehow,someway you've

1618
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:28,930
managed to live your life like the DALI LAMA

1619
01:08:28,930 --> 01:08:30,310
though make shit up because

1620
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:32,520
they don't want you, they want your idea,

1621
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:35,080
and they want you to say thank you while you

1622
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:35,940
"excuse me",

1623
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:37,640
wipe your chin and walk away.

1624
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:38,860
That's what happened to you?

1625
01:08:38,980 --> 01:08:40,310
And delusional.

1626
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:41,700
Yes.

1627
01:08:42,710 --> 01:08:43,680
But there'll be payback in case.

1628
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:45,360
I brought down

1629
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:46,420
the record companies with Napster

1630
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:47,600
and cases of their suffer seems too...

1631
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:50,110
Sorry, you didn't bring down the record companies,

1632
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:51,060
They won.

1633
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:52,030
In court.

1634
01:08:53,490 --> 01:08:54,700
You want to buy

1635
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:55,500
a Tower record, Eduardo?

1636
01:08:58,450 --> 01:09:00,620
And he told story after story about

1637
01:09:00,620 --> 01:09:03,320
life in silicon valley, parties at Stanford,

1638
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:06,030
down in LA, freinds who become millionaires,

1639
01:09:06,030 --> 01:09:10,910
but mostly how Mark had to, he had to come to California...

1640
01:09:11,030 --> 01:09:14,120
and then he cut around to Facebook.

1641
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:16,330
So tell me about your progress.

1642
01:09:16,330 --> 01:09:18,850
Well, we're in 29 schools now,

1643
01:09:18,970 --> 01:09:20,730
we got over 75000 members.

1644
01:09:20,730 --> 01:09:21,950
Tell me about the strategy you're using.

1645
01:09:21,950 --> 01:09:23,950
- Ok. - For intance we wanted Baylor in Texas,

1646
01:09:23,950 --> 01:09:26,320
but Baylor already had a social network on campus so

1647
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:27,740
instead of going right after them,

1648
01:09:27,740 --> 01:09:30,010
we made a list of every school within a hundred miles.

1649
01:09:30,130 --> 01:09:31,650
Put the Facebook on those campuses first.

1650
01:09:31,660 --> 01:09:32,550
Pretty soon all the Baylor kids

1651
01:09:32,550 --> 01:09:33,060
were seeing their freinds

1652
01:09:33,060 --> 01:09:34,060
on our site and we were in.

1653
01:09:34,060 --> 01:09:35,520
It's called the little big horn, it's smart, Mark.

1654
01:09:35,530 --> 01:09:36,530
Thanks. That was mine.

1655
01:09:36,550 --> 01:09:38,880
- Easy. - Hey, you know what settle an arguement for us.

1656
01:09:38,890 --> 01:09:40,490
I say it's time to start

1657
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:41,140
making money through the Facebook,

1658
01:09:41,140 --> 01:09:42,410
Mark doesn't want to advertise.

1659
01:09:42,410 --> 01:09:43,060
Who's right?

1660
01:09:44,540 --> 01:09:46,080
Neither of you yet.

1661
01:09:46,470 --> 01:09:48,800
The Facebook is cool. That's what's that going for.

1662
01:09:49,430 --> 01:09:51,480
You don't want to ruin it with ads, because ads aren't cool.

1663
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:52,000
Exactly.

1664
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:53,750
It's like you're throwing the greatest party on campus,

1665
01:09:53,750 --> 01:09:55,780
and someone saying it's gotta be over by 11.

1666
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:56,800
That's exactly.

1667
01:09:56,830 --> 01:09:58,120
You don't even know what the thing is yet...

1668
01:09:58,120 --> 01:09:58,810
That's exactly.

1669
01:09:58,930 --> 01:10:00,780
how big it can get, how far it can go.

1670
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:02,740
This is no time to put your chips down

1671
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:04,730
A million dollars isn't cool, you know what's cool?

1672
01:10:04,730 --> 01:10:05,240
You?

1673
01:10:08,510 --> 01:10:10,340
A Billion dollars.

1674
01:10:13,790 --> 01:10:14,780
It shut everybody up.

1675
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:16,680
and that's what you're headed,

1676
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:18,480
a billion dollar evaluation.

1677
01:10:19,410 --> 01:10:21,570
Unless you take bad advice in which case you might

1678
01:10:21,570 --> 01:10:24,320
as well have come up with a chain of very succesful yogurt shops.

1679
01:10:24,330 --> 01:10:26,420
When you go fishing, you can catch a lot of fish,

1680
01:10:26,430 --> 01:10:27,930
or you can catch a big fish.

1681
01:10:27,930 --> 01:10:29,280
You ever walk into a guy's tendency of

1682
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:31,500
a picture of him standing next to 14 trout?

1683
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:33,070
No, he likes a 3000 pound marlin.

1684
01:10:33,310 --> 01:10:34,330
That's a good analogy.

1685
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:35,600
OK. We all know that

1686
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:37,150
marlins don't really weigh 3000 pounds, right?

1687
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:38,180
Have you seen the big ones up close?

1688
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:39,190
No I haven't, but I don't think

1689
01:10:39,190 --> 01:10:41,010
the guy holding a marlin the size of a Range Rover,

1690
01:10:41,020 --> 01:10:43,760
that would be a really big fish and a very strong guy.

1691
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:45,460
I think you might be getting away from the point.

1692
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:47,050
I don't have a dog in this fight,

1693
01:10:47,050 --> 01:10:49,230
I'm just a fan and came to say hi.

1694
01:10:49,980 --> 01:10:52,280
He owned Mark after that dinner.

1695
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:53,310
He picked up the check and

1696
01:10:53,310 --> 01:10:55,160
he told Mark that they would talk together soon,

1697
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:57,070
and he was gone,but not before

1698
01:10:57,070 --> 01:11:00,050
he made his biggest contribution to the company.

1699
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:03,350
Drop the "The",

1700
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:05,030
just "Facebook". That's cool.

1701
01:11:10,450 --> 01:11:11,160
Shit.

1702
01:11:21,460 --> 01:11:23,990
That's gotta be some kind of land-speed record for talking.

1703
01:11:24,390 --> 01:11:25,600
You want to end the party at 11.

1704
01:11:27,130 --> 01:11:28,180
I'm trying to pay for the party.

1705
01:11:28,180 --> 01:11:29,070
There won't be a party,

1706
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:30,300
unless it's cool.

1707
01:11:31,990 --> 01:11:32,780
What do you think?

1708
01:11:33,220 --> 01:11:34,840
Yeah, sure. Let's drop the "The".

1709
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:36,410
I meant catching the marlin

1710
01:11:36,410 --> 01:11:37,380
instead of 14 trout.

1711
01:11:38,010 --> 01:11:38,920
Doesn't that sound good?

1712
01:11:39,450 --> 01:11:40,390
If you're a trout.

1713
01:11:41,310 --> 01:11:43,210
I'm going to enter this into the record: incorporation papers

1714
01:11:43,210 --> 01:11:46,610
for Facebook and the analysis registered in Florida.

1715
01:11:46,860 --> 01:11:47,660
Why Florida?

1716
01:11:47,780 --> 01:11:48,870
That's where my familiy lives.

1717
01:11:48,990 --> 01:11:50,530
And ask the respondents to stipulate that

1718
01:11:50,530 --> 01:11:52,770
the articles of incorporation state the ownership as follows:

1719
01:11:52,790 --> 01:11:54,930
65% for Mark Zuckerberg, 30%

1720
01:11:54,930 --> 01:11:56,950
for Edurdo Severin

1721
01:11:56,950 --> 01:11:58,870
and 5% for Dustin Moskovitz.

1722
01:11:59,120 --> 01:11:59,860
I'll stipulate.

1723
01:11:59,860 --> 01:12:02,070
And that was April 13th, 2004.

1724
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:02,750
You can mark it.

1725
01:12:02,870 --> 01:12:04,050
Do you have anything here?

1726
01:12:04,290 --> 01:12:05,590
Yes, thank you.

1727
01:12:05,870 --> 01:12:08,190
Mr. Saverin, have you ever done anything

1728
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:10,900
that might be considered as legitimate grounds

1729
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:13,900
- for termination? - No.

1730
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:15,840
You never did anything to

1731
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:18,810
embarass the company or even seriously jeopardise it?

1732
01:12:19,590 --> 01:12:20,490
- No. - No?

1733
01:12:25,030 --> 01:12:27,330
- No. - You were accused of animal cruelty.

1734
01:12:31,330 --> 01:12:31,890
- Wait. - You weren't?

1735
01:12:32,930 --> 01:12:33,810
This is not happenning.

1736
01:12:33,810 --> 01:12:36,110
Well, I have here an article from the Crimson.

1737
01:12:36,110 --> 01:12:37,590
Jesus christ.

1738
01:12:37,710 --> 01:12:39,130
I can't have this, Eduardo.

1739
01:12:39,130 --> 01:12:41,220
Oh, come on man, this is bull shit.

1740
01:12:41,230 --> 01:12:42,580
This is another club playing a prank.

1741
01:12:43,950 --> 01:12:45,790
I'd gotten into the Phoenix,

1742
01:12:46,250 --> 01:12:48,970
and been accepted as part of my initiation I had to for one

1743
01:12:48,970 --> 01:12:52,790
week carry with me at all times, and take care of a chicken.

1744
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:54,330
They identified you as one

1745
01:12:54,330 --> 01:12:55,240
of the founders of Facebook,

1746
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:57,050
Jr Eduardo Severin?

1747
01:12:57,050 --> 01:12:58,230
I'm not the expert but being

1748
01:12:58,230 --> 01:13:00,480
acted like torturing animals was probably bad for business.

1749
01:13:00,490 --> 01:13:04,840
I did not torture the chicken,I don't torture chickens.

1750
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:05,910
Are you crazy?

1751
01:13:05,910 --> 01:13:07,250
No, and settle down please.

1752
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:09,530
I have here an article from the Crimson.

1753
01:13:09,530 --> 01:13:10,370
This is scathing.

1754
01:13:10,370 --> 01:13:11,140
956.

1755
01:13:11,260 --> 01:13:14,470
I was having dinner at the Kirkland dining hall, with Mark and

1756
01:13:14,470 --> 01:13:18,560
I had the chicken with me, because I had to have the chicken with me at all times.

1757
01:13:18,570 --> 01:13:19,440
This was college.

1758
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:20,940
Somebody is going to have to answer for this.

1759
01:13:20,940 --> 01:13:21,750
969.

1760
01:13:21,750 --> 01:13:23,630
The dining hall was serving chicken for dinner,

1761
01:13:23,630 --> 01:13:26,330
so...and I had to feed my chicken,

1762
01:13:26,330 --> 01:13:30,430
so wha..I took little pieces of chicken and I gave it to the chicken.

1763
01:13:30,430 --> 01:13:32,730
Someone must have seen me because the next thing I knew,

1764
01:13:32,730 --> 01:13:34,310
I was being accused of forced cannibalism.

1765
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:35,970
I didn't know.

1766
01:13:36,090 --> 01:13:37,160
You couldn't do that.

1767
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:39,890
I dealt with various animal rights groups.

1768
01:13:39,890 --> 01:13:42,300
I dealt with the associate dean of the college.

1769
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:44,000
This was all resolved.

1770
01:13:44,270 --> 01:13:45,100
988.

1771
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:46,540
Someone from the Porc or the Fly

1772
01:13:46,540 --> 01:13:47,850
must have reported it,

1773
01:13:47,850 --> 01:13:49,750
for all I know it was the WinkleVosses.

1774
01:13:49,750 --> 01:13:51,050
Alright. Let's just forget about it.

1775
01:13:51,050 --> 01:13:52,070
This is absurd.

1776
01:13:52,190 --> 01:13:54,310
I'm being accused of animal cruelty,

1777
01:13:54,310 --> 01:13:56,020
it's better to be accused of necrophilia.

1778
01:13:56,020 --> 01:13:57,290
It is better to be accused of necrophelia.

1779
01:13:57,290 --> 01:13:58,960
I'm gonna have to explain this to my father,

1780
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:00,700
I'm gonna have to explain this to everybody.

1781
01:14:01,250 --> 01:14:02,610
What is happenning on that?

1782
01:14:02,610 --> 01:14:03,760
I have my final coming up for "Post

1783
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:05,460
War and Contemporary Art", and I haven't been to class.

1784
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:07,340
I'm supposed to write about those 4 paintings.

1785
01:14:07,340 --> 01:14:08,700
That's a Facebook page.

1786
01:14:08,930 --> 01:14:09,960
I put it under an alias

1787
01:14:09,980 --> 01:14:11,840
I posted the paintings and asked people to comment.

1788
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:14,430
Every once in a while I hop and stir the pot to get a good debate going.

1789
01:14:14,430 --> 01:14:16,010
Was Mr. Zuckerberg

1790
01:14:16,010 --> 01:14:17,190
cheating on his final exam?

1791
01:14:17,190 --> 01:14:18,850
I'd rather not answer that question.

1792
01:14:18,860 --> 01:14:19,670
And why not?

1793
01:14:19,670 --> 01:14:22,440
'Cause I'm not suing him for cheating on his final exam.

1794
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:24,330
That's not what freinds do.

1795
01:14:24,450 --> 01:14:26,250
Well, you just told us he was cheating.

1796
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:32,500
You told your lawyers I was torturing animals?

1797
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:34,200
No, he didn't tell us about it at all.

1798
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:36,800
Our litigators are capable of finding a Crimson article.

1799
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:39,320
In fact, when we raised the subject what maybe defended you.

1800
01:14:42,810 --> 01:14:45,950
993. We are so close.

1801
01:14:46,070 --> 01:14:47,870
Oh, yeah, that reminds me....

1802
01:14:48,540 --> 01:14:49,690
we're gonna need more money, Eduardo.

1803
01:14:49,810 --> 01:14:51,290
Yeah, I aggree. More servers, more apps.

1804
01:14:51,410 --> 01:14:52,720
I'm interviewing two interns to come to

1805
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:54,780
Palo Alto and we are going to have to pay them something.

1806
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:55,520
Sorry, what?

1807
01:14:55,530 --> 01:14:57,250
I've already found a house for rent on a street

1808
01:14:57,250 --> 01:14:59,760
two blocks from the Stanford Campus. It's perfect and it's got a pool.

1809
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:01,740
When did you decide to go to Califrnia for the summer?

1810
01:15:01,740 --> 01:15:03,320
You mean when did I actually decide?

1811
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:05,930
Somewhere in the middle of the Sean Parker variety hour?

1812
01:15:06,830 --> 01:15:09,210
He was right. California is the place we gotta be.

1813
01:15:09,210 --> 01:15:10,720
What? You're Jed Clampett?

1814
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:12,930
You got the Beverly Hillbillies in Brazil?

1815
01:15:13,220 --> 01:15:14,690
Shows in Brazil. Jesus.

1816
01:15:14,710 --> 01:15:16,150
What is your problem with Sean?

1817
01:15:16,270 --> 01:15:18,040
He doesn't bring anything to the table,

1818
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:20,200
doesn't have money, Dustin's a better programmer.

1819
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:21,050
He's got connections to VCs.

1820
01:15:21,050 --> 01:15:21,880
To VCs?

1821
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:24,780
If we need advertisers, I have connections to VCs.

1822
01:15:24,780 --> 01:15:26,160
He's a real player.

1823
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:28,460
And as someone who's just really embarrased the company in a bad way.

1824
01:15:28,460 --> 01:15:29,180
It was the

1825
01:15:29,180 --> 01:15:29,790
WinkleVosses, Mark.

1826
01:15:29,790 --> 01:15:30,320
Hang on.

1827
01:15:30,830 --> 01:15:31,580
Here we refresh.

1828
01:15:32,730 --> 01:15:35,030
150,004.

1829
01:15:36,130 --> 01:15:38,200
150,000 members, Eduardo.

1830
01:15:38,890 --> 01:15:40,040
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

1831
01:15:40,970 --> 01:15:42,600
You don't think it was strange

1832
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:44,980
that he was followed by private detectives?

1833
01:15:44,980 --> 01:15:46,260
Who came up with nothing?

1834
01:15:46,260 --> 01:15:47,860
Enough to get him out of the company,

1835
01:15:47,860 --> 01:15:48,770
the drugs the girls?

1836
01:15:48,770 --> 01:15:49,960
We don't know if any of that is true.

1837
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:50,590
We can read about it.

1838
01:15:50,590 --> 01:15:51,760
I can read about you torturing birds,

1839
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:52,960
since we're reading about something...

1840
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:55,630
Eat no fish! Eat no fish?

1841
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:56,470
The marlins and the trout.

1842
01:15:58,950 --> 01:15:59,700
What's he talking about?

1843
01:15:59,700 --> 01:16:01,610
I'm interviewing interns at 10 tommorow

1844
01:16:01,610 --> 01:16:04,380
night in the CS lab. Get on board with these men, you know.

1845
01:16:04,740 --> 01:16:05,860
I don't really know what else to say.

1846
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:37,900
Eduardo!

1847
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:42,130
What's going on?

1848
01:16:42,130 --> 01:16:43,460
They have 10 minutes to

1849
01:16:43,460 --> 01:16:44,910
get root access to a python web server,

1850
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:48,190
expose its SSL encryption, and then intercept all traffic over its secure port.

1851
01:16:48,190 --> 01:16:48,990
They are hacking.

1852
01:16:48,990 --> 01:16:50,300
Yes. All behind a PIX Firewall Emulator,

1853
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:51,140
but here is the beauty.

1854
01:16:51,150 --> 01:16:53,020
You know I didn't understand anything you just said, right?

1855
01:16:53,020 --> 01:16:53,640
I do know that.

1856
01:16:53,650 --> 01:16:54,270
So what's the beauty?

1857
01:16:54,270 --> 01:16:56,300
Every 10th line of code written they have to take a shot,

1858
01:16:56,310 --> 01:16:58,250
and hacking supposed to be stealth, so anytime the

1859
01:16:58,250 --> 01:17:01,140
server detects an intrusion, the candidate responsible has to take a shot.

1860
01:17:01,140 --> 01:17:02,670
I also have a program running that has

1861
01:17:02,670 --> 01:17:04,970
a pop-up window appear simultaneously on all 5 computers.

1862
01:17:04,970 --> 01:17:06,770
The last candidate to hit the window has to take a shot.

1863
01:17:06,770 --> 01:17:09,040
Plus every 3 minutes they all have to take a shot.

1864
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:10,500
Three minutes!

1865
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:13,200
Can I ask what part of the

1866
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:15,150
interns' job will they need to be able to do drunk?

1867
01:17:15,790 --> 01:17:17,230
You're right. A more relavant test would

1868
01:17:17,230 --> 01:17:19,290
be seeing if they can keep a chicken alive for a week.

1869
01:17:21,590 --> 01:17:22,500
That was mean.

1870
01:17:23,150 --> 01:17:23,720
Here.

1871
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:24,800
What is this?

1872
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:27,770
I opened a new acount and put 18000 dollars in it.

1873
01:17:29,380 --> 01:17:30,720
Will that get you through the summer?

1874
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:40,030
Welcome to Facebook.

1875
01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:52,090
- 18000 dollars? - Yes.

1876
01:17:52,210 --> 01:17:55,030
- In addition to the 1000 dollars you already put up. - Yes.

1877
01:17:55,150 --> 01:17:57,600
A total of 19,000 dollars now.

1878
01:17:57,720 --> 01:17:58,240
Yes.

1879
01:18:00,660 --> 01:18:01,980
Hang on. Just checking your math on that.

1880
01:18:02,350 --> 01:18:03,050
Yes.

1881
01:18:03,910 --> 01:18:04,790
I got the same thing.

1882
01:18:05,450 --> 01:18:06,430
May I continue?

1883
01:18:06,870 --> 01:18:08,550
After expressing missgivings about Mr.

1884
01:18:08,550 --> 01:18:11,120
Zuckerburg taking the company and moving it to California

1885
01:18:11,130 --> 01:18:12,580
for the summer, why did you

1886
01:18:12,580 --> 01:18:15,040
put 18000 dollars in the account for his use?

1887
01:18:15,050 --> 01:18:16,550
I figured we were partners.

1888
01:18:16,930 --> 01:18:18,520
I wanted to be a team player.

1889
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:20,140
I figured Mark, Dustin

1890
01:18:20,140 --> 01:18:20,990
and the new interns could

1891
01:18:20,990 --> 01:18:24,450
work on the site while I was generating advertiser interest in New York.

1892
01:18:24,570 --> 01:18:25,790
But mostly I figured,

1893
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:29,080
how much could possibly go wrong in 3 months?

1894
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:38,770
- I didn't die. - I know.

1895
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:40,080
- I made it. - You did.

1896
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:43,690
OK. Ready?

1897
01:18:43,810 --> 01:18:44,470
Davo's like an egg.

1898
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:45,680
That was like a tooth.

1899
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:46,900
He's better than that.

1900
01:18:57,030 --> 01:18:57,650
I'm ok.

1901
01:18:58,040 --> 01:19:00,910
- You're sure? - Nice.

1902
01:19:02,460 --> 01:19:03,950
That's the doorbell.

1903
01:19:04,070 --> 01:19:05,330
I didn't know we had a doorbell.

1904
01:19:05,450 --> 01:19:06,600
Andrew, get the door.

1905
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:07,620
No, he's wired in.

1906
01:19:07,740 --> 01:19:10,090
That's gonna cut into the security deposit.

1907
01:19:12,380 --> 01:19:13,940
- Andrew. - I'm knocked down. - Good boy.

1908
01:19:19,350 --> 01:19:19,850
- Sean?  - Mark.

1909
01:19:20,210 --> 01:19:21,330
Do you live here?

1910
01:19:22,810 --> 01:19:24,910
We live right across the street, we saw the chimney...

1911
01:19:25,230 --> 01:19:25,810
Is anbody hurt?

1912
01:19:25,830 --> 01:19:26,430
You look...

1913
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:27,330
We live across the street.

1914
01:19:29,010 --> 01:19:30,100
I'm Sharon.

1915
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:32,240
This is my...Sharon.

1916
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:32,990
She lives across the street.

1917
01:19:32,990 --> 01:19:34,250
I was helping her move out, we saw the chimney...

1918
01:19:34,370 --> 01:19:36,350
Yeah. We had a little accident by the pool.

1919
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:39,440
You came to California.

1920
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:42,850
You made the right choice.

1921
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:54,680
- There you go. - Sharon.

1922
01:19:58,150 --> 01:19:59,840
- I'm so sorry. - No problem.

1923
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:00,510
- I didnt know you are gonna... - There you go.

1924
01:20:00,980 --> 01:20:01,480
No, wait!

1925
01:20:04,090 --> 01:20:08,330
This house and this team are great exactly what it should be.

1926
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:09,900
I'm Sean Parker.

1927
01:20:10,370 --> 01:20:11,350
Oh, he's wired in.

1928
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:13,340
That's what I'm talking about.

1929
01:20:15,110 --> 01:20:16,270
Where's Eduardo?

1930
01:20:16,390 --> 01:20:18,700
He got an internship in New York.

1931
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:20,760
Eduardo didn't come out?

1932
01:20:41,620 --> 01:20:45,180
I was crashing there for a little bit while I am taking care of somethings.

1933
01:20:45,180 --> 01:20:48,890
But she's done for the summer so she's back at her parents palce.

1934
01:20:48,890 --> 01:20:50,350
The homeless rock star at Palo Alto.

1935
01:20:50,700 --> 01:20:51,330
Alright.

1936
01:20:51,730 --> 01:20:53,040
What's your plan for the summer?

1937
01:20:57,370 --> 01:20:58,900
Im sorry I was looking at the architecture.

1938
01:21:00,550 --> 01:21:01,690
I asked what your plans were.

1939
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:03,270
Honour school till the end of the summer.

1940
01:21:03,690 --> 01:21:05,270
- We are going to the washroom.  - OK.

1941
01:21:10,450 --> 01:21:12,690
Your date looks so familiar to me.

1942
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:13,980
She looks familiar to a lot of people.

1943
01:21:13,980 --> 01:21:15,200
What do you mean?

1944
01:21:17,980 --> 01:21:19,200
My statment is that Roy Raymond

1945
01:21:19,510 --> 01:21:20,940
wants to buy his wife some lingerie.

1946
01:21:20,940 --> 01:21:22,190
But he's to embarased to shop

1947
01:21:22,190 --> 01:21:23,260
for it in a department store,

1948
01:21:23,260 --> 01:21:25,010
comes up with an idea for a high end place

1949
01:21:25,010 --> 01:21:27,800
that doesn't make you feel like a pervert.

1950
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:29,380
He gets a 40.000 dolar bank,

1951
01:21:29,380 --> 01:21:32,300
loan borrows another 40.00 thosand from his in-laws.

1952
01:21:32,310 --> 01:21:35,280
Opens a store and calls it Victoria Secret.

1953
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:37,950
Makes half million dollars the first year.

1954
01:21:37,950 --> 01:21:40,910
So the guy catalogued 3 more stores and after 5 years,

1955
01:21:40,910 --> 01:21:41,830
he sells the company

1956
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:45,180
to Leslie Wester Unlimited for 4 million dollars.

1957
01:21:45,730 --> 01:21:46,910
Happy ending right.

1958
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:48,930
Besides, 2 years later,

1959
01:21:48,940 --> 01:21:51,130
the company is worth 500 million dollars.

1960
01:21:51,130 --> 01:21:54,520
And Roy Raymond jumps off the Golden Gate Bridge.

1961
01:21:56,470 --> 01:22:00,680
The poor guy just want to buy back wife that he has.

1962
01:22:02,470 --> 01:22:03,680
Was that a parable?

1963
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:05,400
I date Victoria Secret models.

1964
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:07,320
That's why she looks familiar to you.

1965
01:22:08,620 --> 01:22:11,470
Don't be impressed by all this. I read your Blog

1966
01:22:11,770 --> 01:22:13,070
Oh, you know that was for white pretty

1967
01:22:13,770 --> 01:22:15,490
You know why I started Napster?

1968
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:18,190
The girl loved in high school

1969
01:22:18,190 --> 01:22:21,060
was with the co-captain of the varsity lacross team.

1970
01:22:21,060 --> 01:22:23,140
And I wanted to take her from him.

1971
01:22:23,140 --> 01:22:25,390
So I decided to come up with the next big thing.

1972
01:22:25,390 --> 01:22:26,320
I didnt know that.

1973
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:28,600
Napster wasn't a failure.

1974
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:31,700
I changed the music industry for better and for allways.

1975
01:22:31,700 --> 01:22:33,210
It may not have been good business.

1976
01:22:33,210 --> 01:22:35,670
And it pissed a lot of people off.

1977
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:38,570
And isn't that what your Facemash was about?

1978
01:22:38,570 --> 01:22:40,470
Their sacred of me pal.

1979
01:22:40,470 --> 01:22:41,680
And their gonna be sacred of you.

1980
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:43,140
And the business wanna say, good idea kid.

1981
01:22:43,140 --> 01:22:45,920
Grown-ups are gonna take it from here.

1982
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:49,160
But not this time. This is our time.

1983
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:51,130
This time you goona hand over a business card

1984
01:22:51,130 --> 01:22:54,670
that says Im CEO, bitch.

1985
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:57,330
That's what I want from you.

1986
01:22:58,780 --> 01:23:00,240
So were the hell is Eduardo?

1987
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:02,220
He's in New York.

1988
01:23:02,340 --> 01:23:03,430
Sucking up to Ad Execs.

1989
01:23:04,580 --> 01:23:05,610
He's got a internship.

1990
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:10,690
The companies here, a billion dollar companies here.

1991
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:13,260
- Do you ever read Facebook.  - Yes.

1992
01:23:13,580 --> 01:23:14,490
I know you do.

1993
01:23:14,610 --> 01:23:15,720
Eduardo wants to be a business manager.

1994
01:23:15,730 --> 01:23:18,040
And for all I know he'll be a good one,

1995
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:19,310
but he shoud'nt be in New York

1996
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:20,950
kissing Madison Avenues ass.

1997
01:23:22,230 --> 01:23:25,670
This is a once in a generation holy shit idea.

1998
01:23:25,670 --> 01:23:30,060
And the water under the Golden Gate is freezing cold.

1999
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:32,520
Look at my face

2000
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:35,080
and tell me I dont know what Im talking about.

2001
01:23:37,790 --> 01:23:39,040
You ever think about that girl?

2002
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:39,580
What girl?

2003
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:42,120
The the girl from high school

2004
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:43,570
who was with the Lacross thing.

2005
01:23:45,780 --> 01:23:46,150
No.

2006
01:23:46,410 --> 01:23:48,680
Did any of your guys talk about that MS?

2007
01:23:49,410 --> 01:23:50,680
- All you got is till the end of the summer?  - Yeah.

2008
01:23:51,740 --> 01:23:54,120
Tell you what, just think with your feet,

2009
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:55,960
When you get into honour school,

2010
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:57,550
I'll put you on 2 continents.

2011
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:00,550
2 continents.

2012
01:24:05,170 --> 01:24:06,560
You don't have a place to crash

2013
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:08,710
I think you shouls definitely come live with us.

2014
01:24:09,890 --> 01:24:11,210
Let's line up some shots.

2015
01:24:11,900 --> 01:24:12,270
Excuse me.

2016
01:24:14,250 --> 01:24:17,170
You can take this away and bring back the 1922.

2017
01:24:17,290 --> 01:24:19,150
Absoloutely Mr.Parker.

2018
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:14,980
Tyler

2019
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:16,580
Thank you.

2020
01:26:17,050 --> 01:26:18,760
Oh and this is my brother Cameron?

2021
01:26:20,310 --> 01:26:21,960
His Royal highness Prince Albert.

2022
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:24,520
Your highness this is Taylor and Cameron WinkleVoss.

2023
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:26,260
Of course brilliant race.

2024
01:26:26,270 --> 01:26:27,880
- I've never seen a race that close.  - Yes, sure.

2025
01:26:28,310 --> 01:26:30,790
My grandfather Jack Kelly was one of the premiere rowers.

2026
01:26:31,770 --> 01:26:33,280
I've been coming to HENLEY for 30 years.

2027
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:35,620
And I've never seen a race that close.

2028
01:26:35,630 --> 01:26:37,420
Have you have you seen a race that close?

2029
01:26:38,630 --> 01:26:38,420
No, your highness.

2030
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:39,600
Mile and a half races

2031
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:41,170
are more commonly won by a boat length or two.

2032
01:26:41,170 --> 01:26:43,030
Yes, that's absloutely right.

2033
01:26:43,030 --> 01:26:44,090
Brutally close.

2034
01:26:44,090 --> 01:26:45,130
May I introduce my teamate...

2035
01:26:45,130 --> 01:26:47,170
I'm sorry. You have to excuse us.

2036
01:26:52,060 --> 01:26:53,930
We flew all the way out here to do that?

2037
01:26:53,930 --> 01:26:55,050
Would'nt of missed it, brother.

2038
01:26:55,050 --> 01:26:56,030
Hows the royalty?

2039
01:26:56,030 --> 01:26:57,080
Ah, he just wanted to tell me a couple of times

2040
01:26:57,080 --> 01:26:58,900
how close the race was.

2041
01:26:58,900 --> 01:27:01,570
Just brutally, brutally excruciating.

2042
01:27:01,580 --> 01:27:03,500
Cam, the guys the prince of a country

2043
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:04,780
the size of Nantucket. Relax, fine.

2044
01:27:04,780 --> 01:27:05,780
Boys.

2045
01:27:06,700 --> 01:27:07,300
Mr.WinkleVoss.

2046
01:27:07,980 --> 01:27:08,600
That was a tough beat.

2047
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:09,870
Im sorry dad you and Mom had to fly all this way

2048
01:27:09,870 --> 01:27:10,360
to see this.

2049
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:11,280
No, son.

2050
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:12,980
Don't apologise to me for loosing a race like that.

2051
01:27:12,980 --> 01:27:14,270
I'd never apologise to anyone

2052
01:27:14,270 --> 01:27:15,730
for loosing a race like that.

2053
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:17,040
Boys.

2054
01:27:17,130 --> 01:27:17,540
Mister Kenright.

2055
01:27:18,030 --> 01:27:19,980
Dad this Mister Kenright,

2056
01:27:19,980 --> 01:27:21,060
part of our host family this week

2057
01:27:21,180 --> 01:27:22,610
-Pleasuer to meet you.  - Pleasure to meet you.

2058
01:27:22,730 --> 01:27:24,880
I had a chat with my daughter.

2059
01:27:24,890 --> 01:27:25,810
She told me that she and her freinds

2060
01:27:25,810 --> 01:27:27,470
allready talking about the race

2061
01:27:27,470 --> 01:27:29,490
which they've just seen via their computers.

2062
01:27:29,490 --> 01:27:31,250
A new website called Facebook,

2063
01:27:31,250 --> 01:27:33,070
Do you have this in America?

2064
01:27:35,150 --> 01:27:35,970
I'm gonna find your mother.

2065
01:27:39,150 --> 01:27:40,350
Did I say something wrong?

2066
01:27:40,350 --> 01:27:41,760
Your daughter does'nt go to school in the States?

2067
01:27:41,780 --> 01:27:44,740
No. No. Cambridge. Majoring in french literature.

2068
01:27:44,740 --> 01:27:46,200
Though I was'nt aware there was such a thing.

2069
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:47,340
They have Facebook at Cambridge?

2070
01:27:47,340 --> 01:27:49,810
And apparently Oxford and the London School of Economics

2071
01:27:49,810 --> 01:27:50,840
for the present.

2072
01:27:50,910 --> 01:27:51,840
Disaster.

2073
01:27:52,980 --> 01:27:56,460
Good race boys, live to fight another day.

2074
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:00,120
Somebody watch my stuff.

2075
01:28:04,850 --> 01:28:05,560
Someone I want to see it  -stop it

2076
01:28:07,850 --> 01:28:08,560
Stop, Cam.

2077
01:28:09,850 --> 01:28:10,460
Knock it off.

2078
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:12,770
I don't mind that we

2079
01:28:12,770 --> 01:28:14,510
lost to the Dutch by less then a secound.

2080
01:28:14,510 --> 01:28:15,490
That was a good race.

2081
01:28:15,490 --> 01:28:18,100
And that was a fair race, that was good race.

2082
01:28:18,100 --> 01:28:20,790
what I mind and you should mind

2083
01:28:20,790 --> 01:28:23,610
showing up on Monday for a race that was run on Sunday

2084
01:28:24,450 --> 01:28:25,800
We tried talking to him ourselves,

2085
01:28:25,810 --> 01:28:26,620
we tried writing a letter,

2086
01:28:26,620 --> 01:28:28,210
we'd tried the add board,

2087
01:28:28,210 --> 01:28:29,530
and we tried talking to the president of the university.

2088
01:28:30,030 --> 01:28:32,250
Now I am asking you for the last time.

2089
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:35,170
Let's take the considerable resources at our disposal.

2090
01:28:35,170 --> 01:28:37,530
And sew him in Federal court.

2091
01:28:38,390 --> 01:28:39,070
Come on.

2092
01:28:40,940 --> 01:28:41,900
I need a real drink.

2093
01:28:49,980 --> 01:28:50,480
Screw it.

2094
01:28:51,990 --> 01:28:53,990
Let's gut the friggin nerd.

2095
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:02,460
Check it out, I saw him today.

2096
01:29:02,830 --> 01:29:04,840
Manningham, Mitchel Manningham.

2097
01:29:06,450 --> 01:29:08,480
Are you guys the Wallhacks or Aimbots?

2098
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:10,230
We don't know were just shooting at each other.

2099
01:29:10,230 --> 01:29:11,610
Use the kamikaze.

2100
01:29:11,730 --> 01:29:13,390
Like we know what that is.

2101
01:29:14,090 --> 01:29:16,630
I saw him getting into his Turbo Carrera,

2102
01:29:16,630 --> 01:29:17,520
and he saw me too.

2103
01:29:17,860 --> 01:29:19,080
I know he did.

2104
01:29:21,740 --> 01:29:24,780
Don't. Don't sweety. I want to go on-line.

2105
01:29:27,370 --> 01:29:28,800
Does any of you get banging?

2106
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:30,540
You can't hear anything your writing code.

2107
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:32,440
Hey, somebody's at the door.

2108
01:29:32,940 --> 01:29:36,440
It's not...

2109
01:29:41,890 --> 01:29:43,230
I'm gonnna call you back.

2110
01:29:45,810 --> 01:29:46,510
What's up?

2111
01:29:46,630 --> 01:29:47,280
What's up?

2112
01:29:50,090 --> 01:29:50,880
Mark was supposed to pick me up

2113
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:51,240
at the airport an hour ago,

2114
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:53,140
I've been calling his cell.

2115
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:55,570
He was on a 36 hour coding tear,

2116
01:29:55,570 --> 01:29:57,100
so he took a nap for a few hours.

2117
01:30:04,420 --> 01:30:05,290
What happened here?

2118
01:30:05,410 --> 01:30:07,450
Not happened, happening.

2119
01:30:07,570 --> 01:30:08,990
Next big thing.

2120
01:30:09,110 --> 01:30:10,080
Eduardo.

2121
01:30:10,580 --> 01:30:12,200
- Hey man.  - Back to work.

2122
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:15,830
Sorry about it, its the more wasted I get.

2123
01:30:16,250 --> 01:30:17,700
I meant the more...

2124
01:30:17,930 --> 01:30:19,340
We understand.

2125
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:23,130
How old are they, Sean?

2126
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:24,930
It's not polite to ask.

2127
01:30:25,050 --> 01:30:25,700
Sean, how old are they?

2128
01:30:27,690 --> 01:30:28,990
You think you know me, right?

2129
01:30:29,010 --> 01:30:29,770
I've read enough.

2130
01:30:29,890 --> 01:30:31,790
You know how much I've read about you?

2131
01:30:38,510 --> 01:30:39,020
-Eduardo.  -Hey, man.

2132
01:30:39,020 --> 01:30:41,970
I waited an hour for you from the airport.

2133
01:30:41,970 --> 01:30:43,450
What time is it?

2134
01:30:43,450 --> 01:30:45,890
Midnight, it was 3am in New York where I just came from.

2135
01:30:47,130 --> 01:30:49,000
You got to see some of the new stuff we got.

2136
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,770
Dustin show him the wall.

2137
01:30:50,770 --> 01:30:51,600
I'm just calling it the wall.

2138
01:30:51,610 --> 01:30:52,700
Forget about the wall,

2139
01:30:52,700 --> 01:30:54,080
tell him about the meeting I got setup.

2140
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:55,590
You know Peter Thiel?

2141
01:30:56,030 --> 01:30:56,680
Nope

2142
01:30:56,680 --> 01:30:58,280
No reason you should.

2143
01:30:58,280 --> 01:30:59,360
He runs funded a 2 billion dollar hedge fund

2144
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:00,690
called Clarium Capital.

2145
01:31:02,170 --> 01:31:03,530
Why's he setting up meetings for you?

2146
01:31:03,540 --> 01:31:04,700
Thiel may want to make an angel investment.

2147
01:31:04,700 --> 01:31:06,080
I don't care if hes an actual angel.

2148
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:07,570
Why is he setting up business meetings?

2149
01:31:08,100 --> 01:31:08,820
You've had a long flight.

2150
01:31:08,820 --> 01:31:10,390
No. I had a long wait at Tarmac at JFK,

2151
01:31:10,390 --> 01:31:11,720
then a long wait at the

2152
01:31:11,720 --> 01:31:13,190
passenger loading and unloading zone at SFO,

2153
01:31:13,190 --> 01:31:14,820
and in between there was a long flight.

2154
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:16,790
I'm the business end of this company.

2155
01:31:17,750 --> 01:31:20,140
And he is a house guest living here rent free

2156
01:31:20,140 --> 01:31:22,730
with a very generous grant

2157
01:31:22,730 --> 01:31:23,410
from the Eduardo Severin Foundation.

2158
01:31:23,410 --> 01:31:24,510
I heard about your big ticket

2159
01:31:24,510 --> 01:31:26,390
add buys "Jerry's Tuxedos"

2160
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:26,790
Hey man.

2161
01:31:26,790 --> 01:31:28,780
The Harvard Bartending Course course.

2162
01:31:28,780 --> 01:31:30,170
Your just one small step away

2163
01:31:30,170 --> 01:31:31,320
from bagging Snookies Cookies.

2164
01:31:40,550 --> 01:31:42,030
Can I talk to you alone for a minute?

2165
01:31:42,030 --> 01:31:42,420
Sure.

2166
01:31:47,370 --> 01:31:48,770
Bong hit.

2167
01:31:48,890 --> 01:31:50,400
I'm so high.

2168
01:31:52,070 --> 01:31:55,460
Hows it going, Hows the internship, Hows Christy?

2169
01:31:57,430 --> 01:31:58,480
Hows the internship?

2170
01:32:01,290 --> 01:32:03,190
Mark, jesus, I quit the internship.

2171
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:04,940
We talked abou this on the phone,

2172
01:32:04,940 --> 01:32:06,010
I quit on my first day.

2173
01:32:07,570 --> 01:32:09,250
I do rememebr you saying that.

2174
01:32:10,010 --> 01:32:10,520
Sounds real.

2175
01:32:12,250 --> 01:32:13,280
Christy's crazy.

2176
01:32:14,070 --> 01:32:14,960
Is that fun?

2177
01:32:14,970 --> 01:32:15,380
No.

2178
01:32:15,950 --> 01:32:20,430
Psychotic, she's insanely jealous, she's irrational.

2179
01:32:20,430 --> 01:32:22,640
And I'm frightened of her.

2180
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:24,790
Still it's nice you have a girlfreind.

2181
01:32:27,270 --> 01:32:29,380
I do not want that guy.

2182
01:32:30,110 --> 01:32:32,120
Representing himself as part of this company.

2183
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:33,680
You got move out here, Eduardo

2184
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:34,200
this is where it all happening.

2185
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:34,610
Did you hear what I just said?

2186
01:32:34,620 --> 01:32:36,270
The connections is the energy.

2187
01:32:36,270 --> 01:32:36,840
Mark, Mark, come on

2188
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:38,520
I'm afraid if you don't come out here

2189
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:39,600
your going to be left behind.

2190
01:32:39,720 --> 01:32:41,610
I want I want I mean you

2191
01:32:43,590 --> 01:32:44,460
What did you just say?

2192
01:32:44,580 --> 01:32:46,820
It's growing faster then any of us imagined it be.

2193
01:32:46,820 --> 01:32:49,310
It's moving fast and Sean thinks that we should...

2194
01:32:49,310 --> 01:32:50,210
Sean's not part of this company.

2195
01:32:50,210 --> 01:32:51,420
We have over 300 thousand memebers

2196
01:32:51,420 --> 01:32:52,620
were in 160 schools.

2197
01:32:52,620 --> 01:32:52,940
I'm aware.

2198
01:32:53,060 --> 01:32:54,170
Including 5 in Europe.

2199
01:32:54,180 --> 01:32:55,160
I'm aware of that, Mark.

2200
01:32:55,160 --> 01:32:56,890
Mark, I'm the CFO.

2201
01:32:56,900 --> 01:32:58,890
We need more programmers and we need more money,

2202
01:32:58,890 --> 01:32:59,630
and he setup the Thiel meeting.

2203
01:32:59,630 --> 01:33:00,950
Hes setup meetings all over town.

2204
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:02,280
Setup other meetings?

2205
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:02,530
Yes.

2206
01:33:02,650 --> 01:33:04,030
Without me knowing anything about it.

2207
01:33:04,030 --> 01:33:04,420
Your were in New York.

2208
01:33:04,430 --> 01:33:05,760
Im in New York riding subways 14 hours a day.

2209
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:08,420
Try explaining that to me.

2210
01:33:08,420 --> 01:33:09,630
Yeah. And hows it going so far?

2211
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:16,100
What did you mean get left behind.

2212
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:22,500
Can I help you?

2213
01:33:22,690 --> 01:33:25,100
I'd like to freeze this bank account,

2214
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:28,460
and cancel all existing checks and lines of credit.

2215
01:33:29,540 --> 01:33:30,770
May I see some ID please?

2216
01:33:30,770 --> 01:33:31,550
Yeah, sure.

2217
01:33:38,990 --> 01:33:41,240
Sean, he'll be right with you.

2218
01:33:43,830 --> 01:33:46,570
You know this where they filmed The Towering Inferno.

2219
01:33:49,790 --> 01:33:51,390
Hey guys, come on back.

2220
01:33:52,890 --> 01:33:53,950
Did she offer you some water

2221
01:33:53,950 --> 01:33:55,200
Oh yeah, were cool.

2222
01:33:57,410 --> 01:33:58,570
You must be Mark.

2223
01:34:01,780 --> 01:34:05,310
We took a look at everything and congratulations.

2224
01:34:05,310 --> 01:34:07,090
We're gonna start you off with a

2225
01:34:07,090 --> 01:34:09,080
500 thousand dollar investment.

2226
01:34:09,080 --> 01:34:11,220
Maurice is going to talk to you about

2227
01:34:11,220 --> 01:34:12,290
some corporate restructurng.

2228
01:34:13,110 --> 01:34:14,950
Well file as a corporation in Delaware.

2229
01:34:14,950 --> 01:34:15,960
We've come up with a

2230
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:17,130
sound structure that will allow us to invest.

2231
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:20,230
Now let me ask you something.

2232
01:34:20,680 --> 01:34:22,740
Who's Eduardo Severin?

2233
01:34:42,740 --> 01:34:43,740
Jesus.

2234
01:34:47,810 --> 01:34:48,460
When did you get back?

2235
01:34:48,460 --> 01:34:50,070
You scared me, I need you to knock.

2236
01:34:50,070 --> 01:34:52,230
When did you get back?

2237
01:34:53,410 --> 01:34:54,930
I got back this afternoon.

2238
01:34:55,050 --> 01:34:56,030
and when are you gonna call me?

2239
01:34:56,660 --> 01:34:58,450
Jesus, it was kind of a bad trip.

2240
01:34:58,750 --> 01:34:59,850
And I was tired.

2241
01:34:59,850 --> 01:35:01,950
or answer 1 of my 47 texts,

2242
01:35:01,950 --> 01:35:03,480
did you know I sent 47 texts.

2243
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:04,420
I did.

2244
01:35:04,430 --> 01:35:07,460
And I thought that was incredibly normal behaviour.

2245
01:35:07,580 --> 01:35:08,810
Are you mocking me?

2246
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:10,360
I bought you a present.

2247
01:35:12,280 --> 01:35:14,450
Why does your status say single on your Facebook page?

2248
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:17,880
Why does your relationship

2249
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:20,400
status say single on your Facebook page?

2250
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:22,130
I was single when I set up the page.

2251
01:35:22,130 --> 01:35:23,770
And you never bothered to change it?

2252
01:35:24,180 --> 01:35:24,520
What?

2253
01:35:25,580 --> 01:35:26,130
I dont know.

2254
01:35:27,020 --> 01:35:28,510
Do I look stupid to you?

2255
01:35:29,100 --> 01:35:30,230
No, calm down.

2256
01:35:30,230 --> 01:35:32,530
Your asking me to believe that the CFO of Facebook

2257
01:35:32,530 --> 01:35:33,480
does'nt know how to change

2258
01:35:33,480 --> 01:35:35,380
his relationship status on Facebook?

2259
01:35:35,380 --> 01:35:36,100
A little embarassing.

2260
01:35:36,100 --> 01:35:37,160
You should take it as a sign of trust

2261
01:35:37,170 --> 01:35:38,440
that I would tell you that.

2262
01:35:38,440 --> 01:35:39,040
Go to hell.

2263
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:39,780
Take it easy.

2264
01:35:39,780 --> 01:35:41,000
You did'nt change it

2265
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,030
so you could SCREW those little Silicon Valley sluts.

2266
01:35:43,030 --> 01:35:44,550
That's not even remotely true.

2267
01:35:44,550 --> 01:35:46,070
And I can promise you that

2268
01:35:46,070 --> 01:35:47,600
the Silicon Valley sluts don't care about

2269
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:50,040
anybodys relationship status on Facebook.

2270
01:35:50,040 --> 01:35:51,930
Please open your present.

2271
01:35:51,930 --> 01:35:53,070
Your phone does work.

2272
01:35:54,460 --> 01:35:55,440
It's Mark.

2273
01:35:57,140 --> 01:35:58,540
Uh, open you present.

2274
01:35:58,840 --> 01:35:59,980
It's a scarf.

2275
01:36:00,780 --> 01:36:02,780
Have you ever seen me wear a scarf?

2276
01:36:02,780 --> 01:36:04,060
This'll be your first.

2277
01:36:05,070 --> 01:36:05,510
Yeah.

2278
01:36:05,820 --> 01:36:06,620
You froze our accounts?

2279
01:36:06,740 --> 01:36:07,180
I did.

2280
01:36:07,300 --> 01:36:08,250
You froze the accounts!

2281
01:36:08,370 --> 01:36:09,560
I had to get you attention Mark.

2282
01:36:09,560 --> 01:36:11,650
Do you realise that you jeapordised the entire company?

2283
01:36:11,650 --> 01:36:12,690
Do you realise that your actions

2284
01:36:12,690 --> 01:36:13,560
could have permanetly destroyed

2285
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:14,110
everything I've been working on?

2286
01:36:14,110 --> 01:36:15,080
We've have been working on.

2287
01:36:15,080 --> 01:36:16,830
Without money the site cant function.

2288
01:36:16,830 --> 01:36:17,650
OK, let me tell you the

2289
01:36:17,650 --> 01:36:19,280
difference between Facebook and everone else.

2290
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:20,450
We dont crash ever.

2291
01:36:20,450 --> 01:36:21,730
If the servers are down for even a day,

2292
01:36:21,730 --> 01:36:24,160
our reputation is irreversibly destroyed.

2293
01:36:24,160 --> 01:36:24,420
Look,

2294
01:36:25,420 --> 01:36:26,320
They have their friends and crews there.

2295
01:36:26,330 --> 01:36:28,380
Even a few people leaving would reverberate, through.

2296
01:36:28,380 --> 01:36:29,760
The whole user database.

2297
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:31,290
The users are interconnected, thats the whole point.

2298
01:36:31,290 --> 01:36:33,160
College kids are line cause their freinds are online.

2299
01:36:33,160 --> 01:36:34,850
And if one domino goes,

2300
01:36:34,850 --> 01:36:35,710
the other domino goes dont you get that.

2301
01:36:35,710 --> 01:36:36,020
Don't you get that?

2302
01:36:36,020 --> 01:36:38,550
I am not going back to the Carribean night of 85.

2303
01:36:40,750 --> 01:36:41,770
Holy shit.

2304
01:36:44,950 --> 01:36:45,970
What's wrong with you?

2305
01:36:45,970 --> 01:36:47,040
Did you like being nobody?

2306
01:36:47,050 --> 01:36:48,210
Did you like being a joke?

2307
01:36:48,210 --> 01:36:49,280
Do you want to go back to that?

2308
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:49,580
Hang on. Hang on.

2309
01:36:49,580 --> 01:36:52,270
That was the act of a child not a businessman

2310
01:36:52,270 --> 01:36:53,990
certainly not the act of a freind

2311
01:36:53,990 --> 01:36:55,330
You know how embarssed I was to cash a check today.

2312
01:36:55,330 --> 01:36:57,530
I am not going back to that life.

2313
01:36:57,530 --> 01:36:59,450
Maybe you were frustrated.

2314
01:36:59,450 --> 01:37:01,270
Maybe you were angry.

2315
01:37:01,270 --> 01:37:01,880
I was.

2316
01:37:02,440 --> 01:37:04,500
But I am willing to let by gones

2317
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:08,160
be bygones because Eduardo I've got some good news.

2318
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:12,260
I'm sorry I was angry and maybe it was childish.

2319
01:37:12,260 --> 01:37:13,800
But I had to get your attention.

2320
01:37:15,460 --> 01:37:16,850
Eduardo I said I've got some good news.

2321
01:37:17,560 --> 01:37:18,120
What is it?

2322
01:37:18,130 --> 01:37:19,090
Peter Thiel has made an

2323
01:37:19,090 --> 01:37:20,850
angel investment of half a million dollars.

2324
01:37:20,850 --> 01:37:21,850
What?

2325
01:37:22,110 --> 01:37:23,200
Half a million dollars.

2326
01:37:23,660 --> 01:37:26,220
And he's setting us up in an office.

2327
01:37:26,740 --> 01:37:28,340
They want to re-incorporate the company.

2328
01:37:28,460 --> 01:37:31,490
They want to meet you they need your signature on some documents,

2329
01:37:31,490 --> 01:37:34,850
you got get your ass on the first flight back to San Francisco,

2330
01:37:34,850 --> 01:37:35,080
I need my CFO.

2331
01:37:40,610 --> 01:37:41,340
I'm on my way.

2332
01:37:41,340 --> 01:37:41,670
Eduardo.

2333
01:37:43,070 --> 01:37:43,570
We did it.

2334
01:37:48,050 --> 01:37:48,770
Eduardo.

2335
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:50,940
You're going back there already.

2336
01:37:50,940 --> 01:37:51,940
Yes.

2337
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:56,760
And also I'm breaking up with you.

2338
01:38:04,780 --> 01:38:06,370
4 documents.

2339
01:38:06,370 --> 01:38:09,090
The first 2 are common stock purchase agreements allowing you to buy

2340
01:38:09,090 --> 01:38:12,070
stock in the newly re-incorporated Facebook

2341
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:14,240
instead of the old shares which are now worthless.

2342
01:38:14,240 --> 01:38:15,980
The third is an exchange agreement,

2343
01:38:15,990 --> 01:38:18,550
allowing you to exchange old shares for new shares.

2344
01:38:18,550 --> 01:38:20,910
And finally the voter holding agreement.

2345
01:38:20,910 --> 01:38:22,870
How many shares of stock will I own

2346
01:38:22,990 --> 01:38:26,670
1,328,334

2347
01:38:26,790 --> 01:38:30,690
That represents 34.4% ownership share.

2348
01:38:30,690 --> 01:38:33,380
Why the increase from the original 30%.

2349
01:38:33,380 --> 01:38:35,850
Because you may dilute to award shares to new investors.

2350
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:39,720
I love working with business majors, don't you?

2351
01:38:40,340 --> 01:38:42,650
You should know that Mark has already

2352
01:38:42,650 --> 01:38:45,130
taken his 60 down to 51.

2353
01:38:46,630 --> 01:38:47,550
Well, Mark doesn't care about the money

2354
01:38:47,550 --> 01:38:49,380
and he needs to be protected.

2355
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:54,860
Dustin Markowitz down to 6.81%.

2356
01:38:54,860 --> 01:38:57,060
Sean Parker 6.47%.

2357
01:38:59,630 --> 01:39:00,430
I can live with that.

2358
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:02,250
And Peter Thiel 7%.

2359
01:39:07,200 --> 01:39:08,270
Would you like to use my pen?

2360
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:10,280
Eduardo.

2361
01:39:11,790 --> 01:39:12,400
Eduardo.

2362
01:39:13,950 --> 01:39:15,270
Can you please repeat the question?

2363
01:39:15,270 --> 01:39:15,960
No, it was an outrageously leading question

2364
01:39:15,960 --> 01:39:16,360
the first time

2365
01:39:16,370 --> 01:39:18,150
and now you want hear it twice.

2366
01:39:18,150 --> 01:39:20,270
Yes, will you read it back please?

2367
01:39:21,110 --> 01:39:21,590
Go ahead.

2368
01:39:21,710 --> 01:39:24,050
Counsel and were you aware that when you were signing

2369
01:39:24,050 --> 01:39:26,870
these documents that you were signing your own death certificate.

2370
01:39:26,870 --> 01:39:27,870
No.

2371
01:39:32,010 --> 01:39:33,420
It was insanely stupid of

2372
01:39:33,420 --> 01:39:35,940
me not to have lawyers look at all this stuff.

2373
01:39:36,060 --> 01:39:38,860
In all honesty I thought they were my lawyers.

2374
01:39:42,830 --> 01:39:43,760
I was your only freind.

2375
01:39:46,100 --> 01:39:47,200
You had one freind.

2376
01:39:52,240 --> 01:39:53,150
My father won't even look at me.

2377
01:39:53,150 --> 01:39:55,040
OK. Eduardo, did Mr Zuckerberg say

2378
01:39:55,050 --> 01:39:57,820
anything to you after you had signed the papers?

2379
01:39:58,600 --> 01:40:01,320
There was a lot of hand shaking a lot of congratulations.

2380
01:40:02,790 --> 01:40:04,360
He already told me that he wouldn't

2381
01:40:04,360 --> 01:40:06,520
be coming back to school for at least a semester.

2382
01:40:07,360 --> 01:40:09,330
So we were saying good bye for a while.

2383
01:40:11,020 --> 01:40:13,080
- And before I left he said. - You gotta come back

2384
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:15,740
Some time around the end of November, early December,

2385
01:40:16,110 --> 01:40:18,530
Peter wants to throw as an amazing party when we hit a million members.

2386
01:40:18,530 --> 01:40:20,400
Its gonna be out of control you gotta come back for it.

2387
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:21,270
A million members.

2388
01:40:23,450 --> 01:40:24,900
Remember the algorithm

2389
01:40:24,900 --> 01:40:26,450
on the window at Kirkland.

2390
01:40:32,450 --> 01:40:33,650
Yeah, I'll be here.

2391
01:40:38,760 --> 01:40:39,920
You sure about this

2392
01:40:40,040 --> 01:40:41,230
You're 20 minutes late.

2393
01:40:41,350 --> 01:40:42,370
You're gonna walk in there and say you

2394
01:40:42,370 --> 01:40:43,970
overslept and you didn't have time to get dressed.

2395
01:40:43,980 --> 01:40:45,370
They're gonna pitch you case equities.

2396
01:40:45,380 --> 01:40:47,760
They're gonna pitch you. They're gonna beg you to take their money.

2397
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:50,090
You're gonna nod, you're gonna nod and then you're

2398
01:40:50,370 --> 01:40:52,540
gonna say which one of you is Roth?

2399
01:40:52,540 --> 01:40:54,360
No, not Roth. Manningham.

2400
01:40:54,360 --> 01:40:56,500
Which one of you is Mitchel Manningham?

2401
01:40:56,500 --> 01:40:57,650
And he'll say I am

2402
01:40:57,650 --> 01:40:59,980
and you say Sean Parker says fuck you.

2403
01:40:59,980 --> 01:41:00,190
Walk out.

2404
01:41:00,190 --> 01:41:02,560
Ok.

2405
01:41:15,560 --> 01:41:17,460
In late November I got the e-mail from Mark

2406
01:41:17,460 --> 01:41:20,140
telling me to come out to the late million member party.

2407
01:41:20,260 --> 01:41:21,910
What else did the e-mail say?

2408
01:41:21,910 --> 01:41:24,370
It said that we had to have a business meeting

2409
01:41:24,910 --> 01:41:26,060
that Mark and Sean had

2410
01:41:26,060 --> 01:41:28,560
played some kind of revenge stunt on case equity.

2411
01:41:29,120 --> 01:41:30,860
And Manningham was so impressed that he

2412
01:41:30,860 --> 01:41:33,520
was now making an investment offer that was hard to turn down.

2413
01:41:34,610 --> 01:41:37,920
So I went to California and I went straight to the new offices.

2414
01:41:38,910 --> 01:41:40,220
I did'nt know whether to

2415
01:41:40,220 --> 01:41:42,570
dress for the party or the business meeting.

2416
01:41:42,690 --> 01:41:44,030
So I kind of dressed for both.

2417
01:41:45,880 --> 01:41:46,820
But it didn't matter.

2418
01:41:47,070 --> 01:41:47,760
Why not?

2419
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:49,910
Because I wasn't called out there for either one.

2420
01:41:50,030 --> 01:41:51,490
What were you called out there for?

2421
01:41:55,590 --> 01:41:56,590
An ambush.

2422
01:41:57,150 --> 01:41:58,570
Mr Severin, right over here.

2423
01:42:10,270 --> 01:42:13,050
At first I thought he was joking

2424
01:42:13,270 --> 01:42:14,980
giving me more contrcts to sign.

2425
01:42:19,140 --> 01:42:20,820
But then I started reading

2426
01:42:24,190 --> 01:42:26,010
Wait. What is this?

2427
01:42:26,460 --> 01:42:29,930
Well, as you know we had some new investors that...

2428
01:42:29,940 --> 01:42:30,930
What is this?

2429
01:42:42,790 --> 01:42:43,860
Severin.

2430
01:42:47,340 --> 01:42:47,870
Mark.

2431
01:42:49,740 --> 01:42:50,330
Mark.

2432
01:42:50,450 --> 01:42:51,740
- He's wired in. - Sorry.

2433
01:42:51,740 --> 01:42:52,590
- He's wired in. - Is he?

2434
01:42:52,590 --> 01:42:53,590
Yes.

2435
01:42:55,200 --> 01:42:57,010
How about now are you still wired in?

2436
01:42:57,010 --> 01:42:58,010
Security.

2437
01:42:57,730 --> 01:43:00,110
You issued 24 million new shares of stock.

2438
01:43:01,390 --> 01:43:03,290
You were told that if new investors came along

2439
01:43:03,290 --> 01:43:05,420
How much were your shares diluted, how much were his

2440
01:43:06,020 --> 01:43:08,920
What were Mr Zuckerberg's ownership shares dilutes down to?

2441
01:43:10,780 --> 01:43:11,250
It wasn't.

2442
01:43:11,480 --> 01:43:14,490
What were Mr Moscovtz's shares shares dilutes down to?

2443
01:43:15,220 --> 01:43:15,660
It wasn't.

2444
01:43:16,040 --> 01:43:18,790
What were Sean Parker's shares shares dilutes down to?

2445
01:43:19,630 --> 01:43:20,260
It wasn't.

2446
01:43:20,630 --> 01:43:23,320
What were Peter Thiel's shares shares dilutes down to?

2447
01:43:23,710 --> 01:43:24,270
It wasn't.

2448
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:27,580
And what were your ownership shares diluted down to?

2449
01:43:28,760 --> 01:43:30,760
.03 percent.

2450
01:43:39,130 --> 01:43:40,110
You signed the papers.

2451
01:43:40,580 --> 01:43:41,520
You set me up.

2452
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:43,420
You're gonna blame me because you were the business head

2453
01:43:43,420 --> 01:43:46,080
of the company and you made a bad business deal with your own company.

2454
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:47,880
It's gonna be like im not a part of Facebook.

2455
01:43:47,880 --> 01:43:49,250
Won't be like your not a part of Facebook,

2456
01:43:49,250 --> 01:43:50,120
you're not a part of Facebook.

2457
01:43:50,120 --> 01:43:51,260
My name's on the masthead.

2458
01:43:51,380 --> 01:43:52,450
You may want to check again.

2459
01:43:52,750 --> 01:43:54,160
Is because I froze the account?

2460
01:43:54,170 --> 01:43:55,720
You think we were gonna let you parade around in

2461
01:43:55,720 --> 01:43:57,830
your ridiculous suit and pretending you were running this company.

2462
01:43:57,830 --> 01:43:59,980
Sorry my Prada's at the cleaners,

2463
01:43:59,980 --> 01:44:02,440
along with my hoodie and fuck-you flip flops.

2464
01:44:02,440 --> 01:44:04,610
You pretentious douche bag.

2465
01:44:04,610 --> 01:44:05,960
Securty's here and you'll be leaving now.

2466
01:44:05,960 --> 01:44:06,990
I'm not signing those papers.

2467
01:44:06,990 --> 01:44:08,640
We will get your signature.

2468
01:44:08,890 --> 01:44:11,880
Tell me this isn't about me getting into the Phoenix.

2469
01:44:15,540 --> 01:44:17,180
You..You did it. I knew you did it,

2470
01:44:17,180 --> 01:44:18,340
you planted that story about the chicken.

2471
01:44:18,340 --> 01:44:20,050
I didn't plant that story about the chicken.

2472
01:44:20,050 --> 01:44:20,680
What's he talking about?

2473
01:44:20,690 --> 01:44:22,180
You had me accused of animal cruelty.

2474
01:44:22,180 --> 01:44:23,380
Seriously, what the hells the chicken?

2475
01:44:23,380 --> 01:44:25,520
And I bet what you hated most was that

2476
01:44:25,530 --> 01:44:29,050
they identified me as a co-founder of Facebook

2477
01:44:29,050 --> 01:44:30,030
which I am.

2478
01:44:30,030 --> 01:44:31,870
You better lawyer up asshole.

2479
01:44:31,870 --> 01:44:35,340
Cause I'm not coming back for 30%,

2480
01:44:35,340 --> 01:44:37,290
I'm coming back for everything.

2481
01:44:43,190 --> 01:44:45,430
- Get him out of here. - It's ok. I'm going.

2482
01:44:48,170 --> 01:44:48,590
Hang on.

2483
01:44:51,670 --> 01:44:52,520
I almost forgot.

2484
01:44:54,130 --> 01:44:55,460
Here's your 19 thousand dollars.

2485
01:44:55,460 --> 01:44:57,190
I wouldn't cash it

2486
01:44:57,190 --> 01:44:57,880
though I drew it on the account you froze.

2487
01:45:03,370 --> 01:45:05,270
I like sitting next to you Sean.

2488
01:45:07,340 --> 01:45:08,460
It makes me look so tough.

2489
01:45:24,350 --> 01:45:26,280
That's it. That's our show for tonight people.

2490
01:45:27,310 --> 01:45:28,920
I want to see everybody here geared

2491
01:45:28,920 --> 01:45:31,120
up for a party were going to walk into that club

2492
01:45:31,120 --> 01:45:32,610
like its Macy's parade,

2493
01:45:32,610 --> 01:45:34,760
Mackie, put it up on the screen, we've gotta almost be there.

2494
01:45:38,410 --> 01:45:39,270
You alright.

2495
01:45:41,470 --> 01:45:42,280
You were kind of rough with him.

2496
01:45:42,890 --> 01:45:44,070
That's life in the NFL.

2497
01:45:45,170 --> 01:45:46,780
You know you didn't have to be that rough on him.

2498
01:45:46,780 --> 01:45:47,950
Listen. I'm putting together a party.

2499
01:45:47,950 --> 01:45:48,510
Sean.

2500
01:45:50,230 --> 01:45:52,250
You didn't have to be that rough on him.

2501
01:45:52,250 --> 01:45:53,650
He almost killed it.

2502
01:45:56,440 --> 01:45:57,380
I'll send flowers.

2503
01:45:59,420 --> 01:46:00,240
Speaking of flowers

2504
01:46:00,250 --> 01:46:02,710
I'm putting together a party after the party

2505
01:46:02,710 --> 01:46:03,340
at Cappa the Sigma.

2506
01:46:04,090 --> 01:46:05,230
Ashley's sister.

2507
01:46:05,620 --> 01:46:06,220
- Ashley. - Intern.

2508
01:46:08,090 --> 01:46:09,130
Yep. I know who she is.

2509
01:46:09,680 --> 01:46:10,380
Are you guys...

2510
01:46:10,940 --> 01:46:11,900
Ashley and me? No.

2511
01:46:12,650 --> 01:46:13,930
I won't go to the party.

2512
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:15,760
Why?

2513
01:46:16,410 --> 01:46:17,350
Excuse me, Mark.

2514
01:46:18,020 --> 01:46:19,450
We were just talking about you.

2515
01:46:19,690 --> 01:46:21,010
Just you're doing a really good job.

2516
01:46:22,010 --> 01:46:23,760
Thanks. I appreciate that.

2517
01:46:25,190 --> 01:46:26,590
These came in for you.

2518
01:46:26,930 --> 01:46:27,920
Put it on my desk.

2519
01:46:35,090 --> 01:46:36,130
What's the package?

2520
01:46:37,380 --> 01:46:37,740
Nothing.

2521
01:46:40,830 --> 01:46:41,380
Mackie.

2522
01:46:41,810 --> 01:46:42,650
Yes, sir.

2523
01:46:42,650 --> 01:46:43,380
Refresh.

2524
01:46:51,780 --> 01:46:53,080
You gotta hugger.

2525
01:46:54,250 --> 01:46:54,790
I know.

2526
01:46:58,090 --> 01:46:59,150
1 million

2527
01:47:01,180 --> 01:47:02,150
Who's got champagne?

2528
01:47:04,440 --> 01:47:06,160
I've got champagne.

2529
01:47:26,590 --> 01:47:29,140
The next transformative, development of picture sharing application,

2530
01:47:29,140 --> 01:47:32,930
a place where you view pictures that coincide with your social life.

2531
01:47:32,930 --> 01:47:36,190
It is the true, the elevation of your life

2532
01:47:36,190 --> 01:47:37,190
- CD? - Good enough for me.

2533
01:47:39,190 --> 01:47:40,350
You don't just go to a party anymore.

2534
01:47:40,370 --> 01:47:41,900
You go to a party with a

2535
01:47:41,910 --> 01:47:44,640
digital camera and your freinds re-live the party online.

2536
01:47:44,640 --> 01:47:46,420
and tagging the idea

2537
01:47:46,420 --> 01:47:47,580
Would it be easier without the bra?

2538
01:47:47,580 --> 01:47:48,580
Guys, we'll find it out.

2539
01:47:57,350 --> 01:47:58,720
Shut the music down. Everybody go.

2540
01:48:03,650 --> 01:48:05,350
I spend hours watching what people do when they login on

2541
01:48:05,350 --> 01:48:08,100
Have they check their freinds status update?

2542
01:48:08,100 --> 01:48:09,100
Wait. That's wired. Why did the music stop?

2543
01:48:09,580 --> 01:48:11,490
They can see when their freinds change their profile

2544
01:48:11,490 --> 01:48:12,830
change their photos and mostly

2545
01:48:12,830 --> 01:48:13,830
Seriously, what happen to the music?

2546
01:48:14,040 --> 01:48:14,940
We lived on farms.

2547
01:48:14,950 --> 01:48:16,930
And now we live in cities

2548
01:48:16,930 --> 01:48:18,190
and now were going to live on the interent.

2549
01:48:18,190 --> 01:48:18,620
Sean, stop.

2550
01:48:18,620 --> 01:48:21,320
I think something's going on downstairs.

2551
01:48:32,670 --> 01:48:33,760
Attention, please. Party is over.

2552
01:48:41,210 --> 01:48:42,100
It's the cops.

2553
01:48:47,670 --> 01:48:49,000
Good to see you, officer.

2554
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:49,890
What can I do for you?

2555
01:48:51,660 --> 01:48:52,210
What's going on?

2556
01:48:52,540 --> 01:48:54,870
Was the music to loud? We were having a celebration.

2557
01:48:54,870 --> 01:48:56,270
Miss, I need you to button your blouse.

2558
01:48:56,390 --> 01:48:58,190
I can tell them to turn the music down.

2559
01:49:03,250 --> 01:49:03,940
That's not mine.

2560
01:49:04,700 --> 01:49:06,520
Ok, we're going to need identification.

2561
01:49:06,520 --> 01:49:08,020
Keep your hands where we can see them.

2562
01:49:08,020 --> 01:49:08,900
Oh my god.

2563
01:49:09,200 --> 01:49:10,120
You got anything else in your pockets I should know about

2564
01:49:10,120 --> 01:49:11,810
No. No, sir.

2565
01:49:11,930 --> 01:49:14,440
Don't be stupid now. I don't. I don't.

2566
01:49:19,610 --> 01:49:20,100
What's this?

2567
01:49:21,270 --> 01:49:22,100
That's an inhaler pump.

2568
01:49:24,080 --> 01:49:25,530
- And this. - It's an inhaler.

2569
01:49:27,280 --> 01:49:27,790
How old are you?

2570
01:49:29,440 --> 01:49:30,080
21.

2571
01:49:31,500 --> 01:49:31,990
21.

2572
01:49:32,380 --> 01:49:33,160
21.

2573
01:49:33,160 --> 01:49:33,930
I'm 21.

2574
01:49:33,930 --> 01:49:35,280
Lying makes it worse.

2575
01:49:36,850 --> 01:49:38,490
I'm sorry I shouldn't have lied.

2576
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:54,180
Listen, something has happened.

2577
01:50:02,520 --> 01:50:04,620
It's alright. We're gonna be alright.

2578
01:50:04,620 --> 01:50:06,160
I've posted a bond.

2579
01:50:06,160 --> 01:50:09,070
I wasn't doing anything, I mean I got allergies.

2580
01:50:13,620 --> 01:50:14,330
Interns.

2581
01:50:14,450 --> 01:50:16,540
It was just a party.

2582
01:50:18,940 --> 01:50:21,970
This is gonna be news. Sean, Its gonna be online in a second.

2583
01:50:24,290 --> 01:50:25,190
I know.

2584
01:50:25,200 --> 01:50:26,400
You know with an intern.

2585
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:28,670
It's cool. I have it under control.

2586
01:50:28,670 --> 01:50:29,620
I will get it under control.

2587
01:50:30,500 --> 01:50:32,600
I will call someone and see what our next move is,

2588
01:50:32,610 --> 01:50:33,870
but this is gonna be news now.

2589
01:50:35,290 --> 01:50:37,250
You don't think Eduardo was involved, do you?

2590
01:50:38,220 --> 01:50:39,400
- You think - No.

2591
01:50:40,070 --> 01:50:42,170
Or Mannie one of them..Somebody

2592
01:50:42,170 --> 01:50:45,150
Somebody sent the cocaine because it got in there

2593
01:50:45,150 --> 01:50:46,830
You believe me. This gotta be find.

2594
01:50:48,020 --> 01:50:52,530
Right?

2595
01:50:56,220 --> 01:50:57,540
Go home, Sean.

2596
01:51:13,110 --> 01:51:13,920
Mark.

2597
01:51:16,530 --> 01:51:17,190
Mark.

2598
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:21,540
We're done for the day.

2599
01:51:22,940 --> 01:51:24,280
Yeah I was just---

2600
01:51:27,760 --> 01:51:28,850
What happened to Sean?

2601
01:51:30,110 --> 01:51:32,330
He still owns 7% of the company.

2602
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:39,890
All you had all day was that salad, you want get something to eat.

2603
01:51:40,940 --> 01:51:42,300
I can't.

2604
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:50,960
I'm not a bad guy.

2605
01:51:51,590 --> 01:51:52,220
I know that.

2606
01:51:53,190 --> 01:51:54,330
In emotional testimony

2607
01:51:54,330 --> 01:51:57,010
I assume 85% of it is exaggeration.

2608
01:51:57,130 --> 01:51:58,040
And the other 15.

2609
01:51:58,280 --> 01:51:58,790
Perjury.

2610
01:51:59,870 --> 01:52:01,410
Creation mess me to devil.

2611
01:52:05,090 --> 01:52:06,060
What happens now?

2612
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:11,790
Sean and the others are having a steak on university avenue.

2613
01:52:12,370 --> 01:52:13,930
Then they'll come back to the

2614
01:52:13,930 --> 01:52:16,500
office and work on a settlement deal without you.

2615
01:52:17,290 --> 01:52:18,760
- They're gonna settle...- Oh, yeah.

2616
01:52:19,670 --> 01:52:21,540
And your gonna have to pay a little extra.

2617
01:52:21,660 --> 01:52:22,050
Why?

2618
01:52:22,420 --> 01:52:25,100
So that these guys sign a non-disclosure aggrement,

2619
01:52:25,100 --> 01:52:26,770
They say one unflatering word about you in public

2620
01:52:26,770 --> 01:52:28,070
and you own their wife and kids.

2621
01:52:28,070 --> 01:52:29,270
I invented Facebook.

2622
01:52:29,270 --> 01:52:30,970
I'm talking about a jury.

2623
01:52:31,600 --> 01:52:34,230
I specialise in voire-dire jury selection.

2624
01:52:34,230 --> 01:52:36,600
What a jury sees when they look at a defendant.

2625
01:52:36,720 --> 01:52:40,230
Clothes, hair, speaking style, likability.

2626
01:52:40,230 --> 01:52:40,280
Likability?

2627
01:52:40,280 --> 01:52:43,790
I've been licenced to pratice law for all of 20 months,

2628
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:45,300
and I could get a jury to believe

2629
01:52:45,300 --> 01:52:47,590
you planted the story about Eduardo and the chicken.

2630
01:52:47,900 --> 01:52:48,640
Watch what else.

2631
01:52:49,410 --> 01:52:51,620
Why weren't you at Sean's sorority party that night?

2632
01:52:52,350 --> 01:52:53,900
You think I'm the one who called the police.

2633
01:52:53,900 --> 01:52:54,510
It does'nt matter.

2634
01:52:54,510 --> 01:52:56,620
I asked the question and now everybody is thinking about it.

2635
01:52:56,620 --> 01:52:58,610
You've lost your jury in the first 10 minutes.

2636
01:53:03,860 --> 01:53:06,520
I was drunk and angry and stupid

2637
01:53:06,530 --> 01:53:07,390
And bloging.

2638
01:53:07,390 --> 01:53:07,990
And bloging.

2639
01:53:09,930 --> 01:53:10,570
Pay them.

2640
01:53:11,420 --> 01:53:14,210
In the scheme of things just beat them ticket.

2641
01:53:16,510 --> 01:53:17,820
That's what Sean will tell you tomorrow

2642
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:20,000
You think anybody would mind

2643
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:21,650
if I stayed and used the computer for a minute?

2644
01:53:21,650 --> 01:53:23,530
I can't imagine it will be a problem.

2645
01:53:23,530 --> 01:53:25,120
Thanks.

2646
01:53:26,460 --> 01:53:27,670
I appreciate your help today.

2647
01:53:31,770 --> 01:53:33,280
You're not an asshole, Mark.

2648
01:53:35,340 --> 01:53:37,010
You're just trying so hard to be.

2649
01:53:58,070 --> 01:53:59,240
