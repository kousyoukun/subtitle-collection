2
00:00:16,603 --> 00:00:18,933
你知不知道 中国的天才
You know there are more people with genius IQ living in China

3
00:00:18,933 --> 00:00:20,996
比美国人口还要多
than they're people of any kind living in United States.

4
00:00:20,996 --> 00:00:22,815
- 这不可能 - 真的
- That can't be possible be true. - That is.

5
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:23,735
为什么呢？
What would account for that?

6
00:00:23,735 --> 00:00:25,272
首先 中国的人口多
First, awful lot people living in China.

7
00:00:25,272 --> 00:00:27,032
但我的问题是
But, here's my question.

8
00:00:27,203 --> 00:00:31,285
在那些SAT考满分的人中 你如何让自己与别不同呢？
How do you distinguish yourself than population of people who all got 1600 under SAT's?

9
00:00:31,285 --> 00:00:33,081
- 中国不考SAT吧 - 没错
- I didn't know they take SAT's in China. - They don't.

10
00:00:33,081 --> 00:00:35,203
但我说的不是中国 是我自己
I wasn't talkin' about China anymore. I was talkin' about me.

11
00:00:35,203 --> 00:00:36,782
- 你考了满分？ - 对
- You got 1600? - Yes.

12
00:00:36,782 --> 00:00:38,944
我本可以去合唱团的 但我不会唱歌
I can sing in a Capella group, but I can't sing.

13
00:00:38,944 --> 00:00:40,331
也就是你SAT一道题都没错
Does that mean you actually got nothing wrong?

14
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:42,159
我可以划赛艇 也可以发明25美元的电脑
I could row crew or invent a 25 dollar PC.

15
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:43,894
或者加入终极俱乐部？
Or you get into the "Final Club"?

16
00:00:43,894 --> 00:00:45,425
对 也可以加入终极俱乐部
Or I get into the "Final Club".

17
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:48,761
从女人的角度来看 男人不加入是件好事
You know, from women perspective sometimes, not seeing a man in is a good thing.

18
00:00:48,761 --> 00:00:50,915
- 我没开玩笑 - 不过我还挺喜欢男生划赛艇的
- This is serious. - On the other hand, I do like a row crew.

19
00:00:51,448 --> 00:00:53,304
呃 那玩意我弄不来
Well, I can't do that.

20
00:00:53,304 --> 00:00:55,948
- 我开玩笑的 - 我SAT一道题都没错
- I was kidding. - Yes, I got nothing wrong in test.

21
00:00:56,132 --> 00:00:57,108
那你有试过吗？
Have you ever tried?

22
00:00:57,108 --> 00:00:58,835
- 我正尝试着呢 - 尝试加入赛艇队？
- I'm trying right now. - To row crew?

23
00:00:58,835 --> 00:01:02,479
是终极俱乐部 怎么会是赛艇队 才不 你是不是误会了
Gettin' into "Final Club". To row crew? No! Are you like... whatever, delusional?

24
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,350
可能吧 有时候你两件事一块说
Maybe, sometimes you said 2 things at once,

25
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:05,877
我就抓不住你的重点了…
I'm not sure which one I suppose to be aiming at...

26
00:01:05,877 --> 00:01:08,343
不过你见过划赛艇的人 对吧
But you seen guys who row crew, right?

27
00:01:08,606 --> 00:01:10,153
- 没啊 - 好吧 他们比我壮
- No. - Ok, well, they bigger than me.

28
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,173
都是世界级的运动员
They world class athlete.

29
00:01:11,173 --> 00:01:12,935
你刚刚还说喜欢划赛艇的
Like a second ago you said you like guys who row crew.

30
00:01:12,935 --> 00:01:13,855
所以我想你该见过
So I assumed you've met one.

31
00:01:13,855 --> 00:01:17,916
我就是那意思 就像女孩都喜欢牛仔一样
I guess, I just meant like the idea of it, you know the way a girl likes cowboys.

32
00:01:18,642 --> 00:01:19,618
好吧
Ok.

33
00:01:20,156 --> 00:01:20,933
我们是不是应该点些吃的
Should we get something to eat?

34
00:01:20,933 --> 00:01:23,043
你想不想谈点别的
Would you like to talk about something else?

35
00:01:23,043 --> 00:01:26,808
不 只是从讨论终极俱乐部开始
No, it just that since the beginning of the conversation about the "Finals Club"

36
00:01:26,808 --> 00:01:28,543
我就觉得时间过得很快
I think I may have miss a birthday.

37
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:32,388
中国天才真的比美国的总人口…
There are really more people in China with genius IQ's than entire...

38
00:01:32,388 --> 00:01:35,775
凤凰俱乐部最多元化 还有福莱俱乐部 罗斯福加的是坡客
"Phoenix" is the most diverse. The "Fry Club", Roosevelt punched the porc.

39
00:01:35,775 --> 00:01:36,403
哪个罗斯福？
Which one?

40
00:01:36,403 --> 00:01:38,326
坡斯廉俱乐部 也叫坡客 是最顶尖的
"The Porcellian, the Porc, it's the best of the best"

41
00:01:38,326 --> 00:01:39,302
我是问哪个罗斯福？
Which Roosevelt?

42
00:01:39,302 --> 00:01:40,603
西奥多.罗斯福
Theodore

43
00:01:41,562 --> 00:01:43,835
是不是他们真用大巴去接…
Is it true they send a bus around to pick up the girls?

44
00:01:43,835 --> 00:01:45,587
想和下任凤凰俱乐部主席开派对的姑娘啊
Who wanna party with next phoenix chairman.

45
00:01:45,587 --> 00:01:47,467
你懂为什么我想去那了吧
So you can see why it's so important to get in.

46
00:01:47,467 --> 00:01:49,953
好吧 哪个是最容易加的
Well, which is the easiest to get into?

47
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:53,447
你为什么问我这个
Why would you ask me that?

48
00:01:53,701 --> 00:01:54,990
就随便问问
I was just asking.

49
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,941
没有容易的  这才是关键
None of them. That's the point.

50
00:01:57,346 --> 00:02:00,350
我朋友爱德华多 去年夏天 靠投机石油期货赚了三十万
My friend, Eduardo made $300.000 betting oil futures one summer.

51
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,817
可他想进去还差得远呢
And Eduardo won't comes close to get in.

52
00:02:01,817 --> 00:02:03,978
这里的人根本不看重挣钱的能力
The ability to make money doesn't impress anybody around here.

53
00:02:03,978 --> 00:02:07,323
他一定很厉害 一夏天挣了三十万啊
Must be nice. He made $300.000 in a summer.

54
00:02:07,523 --> 00:02:09,715
- 他喜欢气象学 - 你刚才不是还说石油期货吗
- He likes meteorology. - You said it was oil futures.

55
00:02:09,715 --> 00:02:11,751
你要是能预知天气 你就能预测燃油的价格
You can read the weather, you can predict the price of heating oil.

56
00:02:11,751 --> 00:02:15,273
你刚才那么问我 是不是觉得 只有最容易进的终极俱乐部
I think you ask me that because you think the "Final Club" that's easiest to get into is the one,

57
00:02:15,273 --> 00:02:16,765
我才有希望啊
where I'll have the best chance...

58
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:18,290
什么
What?

59
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,244
你问我哪个是最容易进的
You ask me which one is the easiest to get into

60
00:02:20,244 --> 00:02:22,839
因为你觉得我进那个的可能性最大
Because you think that the one, where I have the best chance.

61
00:02:22,839 --> 00:02:24,646
你容易进
The one that the easiest is to get into,

62
00:02:24,646 --> 00:02:26,893
别人也容易进啊
Would be the one where anybody has the best chance.

63
00:02:26,893 --> 00:02:28,379
你问的不是哪个是最好的
You didn't ask me which one was the best one.

64
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:30,005
你问我哪个是最容易进的
You ask me which one was the easiest one.

65
00:02:30,005 --> 00:02:31,698
我就那么一问 好吧
I was honestly just asking, ok...

66
00:02:31,698 --> 00:02:33,402
就那么一问…
I was just asking to ask...

67
00:02:33,402 --> 00:02:36,196
- 马克 我没别的意思 - 艾瑞卡
- Mark, I'm not speaking in code. - Erika,

68
00:02:36,386 --> 00:02:38,522
你已经沉迷在终极俱乐部了
You obsesses with "Finals Clubs"

69
00:02:38,522 --> 00:02:40,924
你得了终极俱乐部强迫症 你得找个医生看看
You have "Finals Clubs" - OCD  You need to see someone about it.

70
00:02:40,924 --> 00:02:42,803
让他给你开点药
who'll prescribe you some sort of medication

71
00:02:42,803 --> 00:02:45,076
反正你也不在乎副作用会不会让你失明
You don't care if the side effect may include blindness.

72
00:02:45,076 --> 00:02:48,311
是终极俱乐部 不是决赛俱乐部
"Final Clubs" not "Finals Clubs"

73
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:51,725
而且沉湎其中和积极进取是不一样的
And there's a difference between being obsessed than being motivated.

74
00:02:51,725 --> 00:02:54,505
没错 是不一样
Yes, there is.

75
00:02:54,505 --> 00:02:56,765
你就是这样 你刚刚就是话里有话
Well, you do that, it's was cryptic, so you do speaking code.

76
00:02:56,765 --> 00:02:57,661
我没想说别的
I didn't mean to be cryptic.

77
00:02:57,661 --> 00:03:01,542
我所要说的就是我需要做点大事 好让他们注意到我
I'm just saying I need to do something substantial in order to get the attention of the club.

78
00:03:01,542 --> 00:03:02,156
为什么
Why?

79
00:03:02,156 --> 00:03:04,635
因为那地方独一无二 乐趣横生
Because they're exclusive and fun.

80
00:03:04,635 --> 00:03:05,771
而且能让我过的更好
And they lead to the better life.

81
00:03:05,771 --> 00:03:07,758
泰迪罗斯福选上美国总统
Teddy Roosevelt didn't get elected for the president

82
00:03:07,758 --> 00:03:11,803
- 也不是因为他是凤凰俱乐部的啊 - 就是这个原因 还有 他是坡斯廉的
- because he was member from "Phoenix" Club? - He was a member of The Porcellian, and yes he did.

83
00:03:11,896 --> 00:03:15,969
你怎么不集中精力做你最好的自己呢
Why don't you just concentrate on being the best you, you can be.

84
00:03:16,053 --> 00:03:16,887
你真这么觉得
Did you really just said that?

85
00:03:16,887 --> 00:03:18,089
开玩笑的
I was kidding.

86
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:21,319
- 我就是陈述事实 一点也不过分 - 我就和你直说吧
- *** - I wanna try to be straight forward

87
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:24,045
我觉得你应该支持我
*** You might wanna be a little more supportive.

88
00:03:24,111 --> 00:03:26,680
如果我进了俱乐部 我就能带你去参加各种聚会活动
If I get in I will be taking you to the events

89
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,974
还可以介绍很多你平时见不到的人物认识
and the gatherings and will be meeting a lot of people you won't normally get to meet.

90
00:03:31,851 --> 00:03:33,703
你真打算这样吗
You would do that for me?

91
00:03:33,884 --> 00:03:34,654
你是我女朋友啊
We're dating.

92
00:03:35,693 --> 00:03:36,822
好吧 
Ok,

93
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:42,007
那我也和你直说吧 咱俩完了
well I wanna try and be straight forward even let you know that we're not anymore.

94
00:03:42,007 --> 00:03:43,017
你什么意思
What you mean?

95
00:03:43,017 --> 00:03:44,563
我们不再是男女朋友了 对不起
We're not dating anymore. I'm sorry.

96
00:03:44,563 --> 00:03:46,817
- 开玩笑的吧 - 我认真的
- This is a joke? - No, it's not.

97
00:03:46,817 --> 00:03:47,663
你要跟我分手
You're breaking up with me?

98
00:03:47,663 --> 00:03:51,018
你要介绍我认识一些我平时见不到的人物
You gonna introduce me the people I wouldn't normally have the chance to meet.

99
00:03:51,018 --> 00:03:51,687
这他妈…
What the f...

100
00:03:51,687 --> 00:03:53,443
- 这到底什么意思啊？ - 淡定点
- What is that supposed to mean? - Wait, settle down.

101
00:03:53,443 --> 00:03:54,384
我什么意思？
What is it supposed to mean?

102
00:03:54,384 --> 00:03:56,043
艾瑞卡 我们之所以坐在这喝一杯
Erica, the reason we're able to sit and drink right now,

103
00:03:56,043 --> 00:03:57,613
是因为你过去和看门那家伙上过床
because you used to sleep with the door guy.

104
00:03:59,256 --> 00:04:00,943
他叫鲍比
"The door guy" his name is Bobby.

105
00:04:00,943 --> 00:04:02,721
我没跟他上过床
I have not slept with "the door guy".

106
00:04:02,721 --> 00:04:04,181
他是我的一个朋友
"The door guy" is a friend of mine.

107
00:04:04,181 --> 00:04:06,542
而且他是个好人
And he's the perfectly good class of people.

108
00:04:07,402 --> 00:04:10,087
你就出身名门吗？
And what part of Long Island you from? Wimbledon?

109
00:04:10,087 --> 00:04:12,825
- 别别 你真生气了 - 我回去了
- Wait,Wait, wait is this real? - I'm going back to my dormy.

110
00:04:12,825 --> 00:04:14,979
- 是的 - 那好吧 我道歉还不行
- Yes. - Ok, than wait, I apologize, ok...

111
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:15,915
- 我要去看书了 - 艾瑞卡…
- I have to go study. - Erika...

112
00:04:15,915 --> 00:04:18,084
- 怎么 - 我真心的道歉
- Yes? - I'm sorry, I meant it.

113
00:04:18,084 --> 00:04:19,571
我很满意 但我真得回去学习了
I appreciate that but I have to go study.

114
00:04:19,571 --> 00:04:20,399
别这样 你回去也不学习  
Come on. You don't have to study.

115
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,784
何必回去呢 我们谈谈吧
You don't have to study. Let just talk.

116
00:04:21,784 --> 00:04:22,870
- 不行 - 为什么
- I can't - Why?

117
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,923
因为我累了 跟你约会 就像和跑步机约会一样
Because it is exhausting. Dating you is like dating a stairmaster.

118
00:04:25,923 --> 00:04:27,275
我就是说 你现在用不着…
All I meant is that you not likely to...

119
00:04:27,812 --> 00:04:29,676
我不是说你爸妈
Currently, I wasn't making a comment on you're parents.

120
00:04:29,676 --> 00:04:30,764
我就是说你去的是波士顿大学
I was saying that you go to B.U. *Boston University*

121
00:04:30,764 --> 00:04:31,741
我就是陈述事实 就这样  
I was studying a fact. That's all.

122
00:04:31,741 --> 00:04:32,953
如果你认为我太粗鲁 我还是会道歉的
If it's seem rude, than of course I've to apologize.

123
00:04:32,953 --> 00:04:34,523
- 我要去看书了 - 你不用看的
- I have to go study. - You don't have to study.

124
00:04:34,523 --> 00:04:37,230
- 你为什么总说我不用学习啊 - 因为你就念个波士顿大学而已
- Why you keep saying that I don't need to study. - Because you go to B.U.

125
00:04:39,719 --> 00:04:40,991
想吃点什么吗
Wanna get some food?

126
00:04:42,035 --> 00:04:45,087
非常抱歉我的教育程度没能让您满意
I'm sorry you're not sufficiently impressed with my educations.

127
00:04:45,087 --> 00:04:46,529
我也很抱歉 因为我没有赛艇
I'm sorry, I don't have a row boat.

128
00:04:46,529 --> 00:04:48,490
- 那我们扯平了 - 我想我们还是做朋友吧
- So we're even. - I think we should just be friend.

129
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:49,778
我不缺朋友
I don't want friends.

130
00:04:49,973 --> 00:04:52,472
我也就是客气下 我一点也不想和你做朋友
I was just being polite. I have no intention of being friends with you...

131
00:04:52,472 --> 00:04:54,391
操作系统课让我压力很大
I'm under some pressure right now from my OS class.

132
00:04:54,391 --> 00:04:56,083
点些吃的吧 或许我们就能…
If could just order some food. I think we should...

133
00:04:57,131 --> 00:05:00,996
或许你以后在电脑行业会大有作为
Look, you will probably going to be very successful computer person.

134
00:05:02,422 --> 00:05:04,641
你一辈子都会觉得
You gonna go thru life thinking that girls don't like you,

135
00:05:04,641 --> 00:05:06,525
女孩子不喜欢你是因为你是书呆子
Because you're a nerd...

136
00:05:07,202 --> 00:05:10,546
但我真心的说 你错了
I want you know, from the bottom of my heart that won't be true.

137
00:05:11,922 --> 00:05:14,742
那是因为你是个混蛋
It would be because you are an asshole.

138
00:05:26,053 --> 00:05:28,739

社交网络
The Social Network

141
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:45,477
哈佛大学 秋天 2003年
Harvard University, Fall 2003

142
00:07:49,234 --> 00:07:50,815
科克兰公寓
Kirkland House

143
00:08:09,653 --> 00:08:11,627
晚上8点13分
8:13 PM

144
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,618
艾瑞卡?奥布莱特就是个贱货
Erika Albright's a bitch

145
00:08:18,618 --> 00:08:21,221
你这么说 是因为她家之前姓奥布莱希特
You think that's because her family changed their name from Albrecht?

146
00:08:21,221 --> 00:08:23,873
还是你觉得所有波士顿大学的女生都是婊子呢
Or do you think because all B.U. girls are bitches?

147
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,918
郑重声明 她也许看着有34C
For the record, she may look like a 34C.

148
00:08:30,918 --> 00:08:33,604
但那全是丰胸内衣的功劳
but she's getting all kind of help from our friends at "Victoria's Secret"

149
00:08:33,604 --> 00:08:36,420
她只有34B 而且里面就像飞机场一样
She's a 34B, as in barely anything there.

150
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,017
虚假广告害死人
False Advertising.

151
00:08:39,714 --> 00:08:41,597
晚上 9点48分
9:48 PM

152
00:08:41,818 --> 00:08:43,694
事实上她脸蛋还不错
The truth is she has a nice face.

153
00:08:43,694 --> 00:08:45,763
我得干点什么转移注意力
I need to do something to take my mind of her.

154
00:08:45,763 --> 00:08:47,915
说着容易 但我得先有个办法
Easy enough, except I need an idea.

155
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:56,983
我有点喝醉了 我不会撒谎的
I'm a little intoxicated. I'm not gonna lie.

156
00:08:56,983 --> 00:08:59,511
就算是无聊的周二 还没到十点 又有什么关系呢
So, what if it's not even 10pm and it's a Tuesday night?

157
00:09:00,168 --> 00:09:01,864
科克兰的Facebook开在我桌面上
The Kirkland's facebook is open on my desktop

158
00:09:01,864 --> 00:09:04,289
有人上传了不少雷人的照片
And somebody of these people with pretty horrendous facebook pics.

159
00:09:05,588 --> 00:09:07,286
坐在那的比利?奥罗森出了个主意
Billy Olsen's sitting here had the idea,

160
00:09:07,286 --> 00:09:09,306
说把这些照片和家禽家畜放在一起
putting some of the picture next to picture of farm animal,

161
00:09:09,306 --> 00:09:11,351
然后让大家投票看哪个更火
and have people vote who's hotter.

162
00:09:11,795 --> 00:09:13,335
这主意不错啊 奥罗森先生
Good call, Mr. Olsen!

163
00:09:20,038 --> 00:09:21,603
好的 开始
Yeah, it's on.

164
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:24,565
我不想和家禽家畜比 但我觉得拿两个人比不错
I'm not gonna do the farm animal but I like the idea of comparing two people together.

165
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:28,334
因为这比Hotornot.com上 给性感程度直接打分的方式更含蓄
It gives the whole thing a very "Turing" feel since people's rating of the picture is more implicit...

166
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:32,391
给人一种"图灵机"的感觉 (存储量没有限制的理论计算机)
Than say, choosing a number to represent each person's hotness like they do on hotornot. com

167
00:09:32,857 --> 00:09:34,910
首先我们需要许多照片
The first thing we're going to need is a lot of picture

168
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,411
不幸的是哈佛没有统一公开的照片库
Unfortunately, Harvard doesn't keep a public centralized facebook,

169
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:40,415
所以我将从各自宿舍电脑盗取他们照片
So I'm going to get all the images from the individual houses that people are in,

170
00:09:42,158 --> 00:09:43,626
黑客登场
Let the hacking begin!

171
00:09:59,337 --> 00:10:03,555
从科克兰开始 这里的一切都是公开的 还允许在Apache系统中里插入目录
First up is Kirkland, they keep everything open and allow indexes in their Apache configuration,

172
00:10:03,555 --> 00:10:08,031
所以用个WGET就能下载 科克兰全部的照片库图片了
So a little wget magic is all that's necessary to download the entire Kirkland facebook.

173
00:10:08,031 --> 00:10:09,157
易如反掌
Kid's stuff.

174
00:10:26,688 --> 00:10:29,844
下来是伊利尔特 他们也是公开的 但在Apache上加不了目录
Next is Eliot. They're also open, but with no indexes in Apache.

175
00:10:29,844 --> 00:10:33,456
我进行一个空白搜索 接着数据库里的所有图片就会显示出来
I can run an empty search and it returns all of the images in the database in a single page.

176
00:10:33,456 --> 00:10:36,712
然后我保存网页 火狐就会帮我存好照片
Then I can save the page and Mozilla will save all the images for me.

177
00:10:36,915 --> 00:10:39,098
不错 进展顺利
Excellent. Moving right along.

178
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:41,165
请注意
Excuse me, everybody...

179
00:10:41,165 --> 00:10:47,729
你们现在所在的是 全世界最古老最有特色俱乐部
You're in one of the oldest, one of the most exclusive club, not just Harvard but in the world.

180
00:10:47,729 --> 00:10:52,302
现在我宣布凤凰俱乐部秋季学期首场派对开始
Now, I wanna welcome you all, The Phoenix Club First Party of the fall semester.

181
00:10:59,548 --> 00:11:02,453
洛厄尔有安全防护 需要用户名和密码
Lowell has some security they require username/password combo.

182
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:05,423
我可以直接进入 而且说他们没有FAS用户权限
I'm gonna go ahead and says the don't have an access to main fas user database

183
00:11:05,423 --> 00:11:07,425
所以他们看不到这次入侵
So they have no worry detecting an intrusion.

184
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:11,670
亚当斯没有安全系统 且每页只能显示20个结果
Adams has no security but limit the number of result to 20 of pages,

185
00:11:11,818 --> 00:11:15,206
我再用一次对付洛厄尔的办法就能搞定
All I need to do is to break up some script I use on Lowell and reset.

186
00:11:16,369 --> 00:11:18,737
昆西都没有在线的Facebook 真寒碜
Quincy has no online facebook, what a shame!

187
00:11:18,801 --> 00:11:20,537
这我也没办法
Nothing I can do about that.

188
00:11:21,239 --> 00:11:25,184
顿斯特不太好弄 他们不是没公共目录 他们压根就没目录
Dunster is intense not only there's no public directory but there's no directory at all.

189
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:28,892
你必须进行搜索 而且每次超过二十个结果 就什么都不会显示
You have to do searches. And if you're search return more than 20 matches, nothing's get return.

190
00:11:28,892 --> 00:11:31,301
一旦有个结果 也不会直接连接到图片
Once you do get result, they don't link directly to images.

191
00:11:31,301 --> 00:11:33,353
而是连接到个人网页或别的什么
They link to PHP that redirect to something.

192
00:11:33,353 --> 00:11:35,525
很奇怪 估计不太容易 我一会再弄
Weird! That's maybe difficult, I'll come back later.

193
00:11:35,525 --> 00:11:37,277
- 马克 谢尔顿醒了 - 怎么了
- Hei, Mark! - What?

194
00:11:38,056 --> 00:11:39,982
- 做的好 鱼很不错 - 谢了
- Great one. Beautiful fish. - Thanks.

195
00:11:39,982 --> 00:11:41,995
埃弗雷特稍好点 虽然还是要搜索
Leverett is a little better. They still make you search.

196
00:11:41,995 --> 00:11:45,259
空白搜索会链接到有每个学生照片的网页上
But you can do an empty search and get links to pages with every students pictures

197
00:11:45,259 --> 00:11:47,772
恶心的是 每次只能打开一张
I slightly obnoxious that they only let you view one picture at a time...

198
00:11:47,772 --> 00:11:50,833
我不可能打开五百个网页 下载一百次照片
There's no way I'm gonna go to 500 pages to download pics one at a time

199
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:54,095
所以有必要退出EMACS 修改Perl代码
So it's definitely necessary to break out emacs and modify that Perl script.

200
00:12:00,455 --> 00:12:02,410
凌晨 2点08分
***

201
00:12:11,437 --> 00:12:12,344
搞定
Done.

202
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:14,271
怎样了
Hey, what's goin' on?

203
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:15,741
时机正好 爱德华多来了
Perfect timing.

204
00:12:15,741 --> 00:12:18,776
他有我最需要的东西
Eduardo is here and he is going to have the key ingredients

205
00:12:18,776 --> 00:12:20,165
- 马克 - 爱德华多…
- Hey Mark, - Eduardo...

206
00:12:20,165 --> 00:12:21,927
你和艾瑞卡分手了？
You and Erica split up?

207
00:12:22,768 --> 00:12:23,657
你怎么知道的
How did you know that?

208
00:12:23,657 --> 00:12:25,458
你博客上都写着呢
It's on your blog.

209
00:12:25,986 --> 00:12:27,802
- 好吧 - 你还好吧
- Yeah. - Are you alright?

210
00:12:27,802 --> 00:12:29,855
- 我要你帮忙 - 我就是干这个来的
- I need you. - I'm here for you.

211
00:12:30,192 --> 00:12:32,304
不是要你安慰我 我需要你投机石油时用的公式
No, I need the algorithm you use to rank chess players.

212
00:12:32,304 --> 00:12:33,371
你没事儿吧
Are you ok?

213
00:12:33,568 --> 00:12:34,965
我们在给女孩打分
We're ranking girls.

214
00:12:36,988 --> 00:12:39,110
- 你说女学生吗 - 对
- You mean others student. -Yup.

215
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,787
你觉得这是个好主意吗
You think this such a good idea?

216
00:12:40,864 --> 00:12:43,774
我需要那个运算公式
I need the algorithm, alright. I need the algorithm.

217
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:47,726
每个女生有1400的基础分
Each girl base rating 1400.

218
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:52,232
在某一时刻女孩A得到R-a的评分 女孩B得到R-b的评分
At any given time "Girl A" has a rating R-a and "Girl B" has a rating R-b.

219
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:53,742
当对任意两个女孩进行评比时
When any 2 girls are matched up,

220
00:12:53,742 --> 00:12:56,563
会根据已有的分数进行的评测
there's an expectation of which will win based on their current rating, right?

221
00:12:56,563 --> 00:12:59,986
没错 这些评测方法写出来就是这样
yeah.And all those expectations are express this way.

222
00:13:00,342 --> 00:13:01,299
把这些写成程序吧
Let's write it.

223
00:13:16,703 --> 00:13:17,967
左边的
The one on the left.

224
00:13:18,689 --> 00:13:19,827
右边的
The right.

225
00:13:20,134 --> 00:13:21,702
右边的
***

226
00:13:21,702 --> 00:13:23,354
- 搞定了 - 我们该先传给谁呢
- It works. - Who should we send it first?

227
00:13:23,354 --> 00:13:24,805
- 德怀恩 - 尼尔
- Dwyer - Neal

228
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:26,156
你想传给谁
Who will you send it to?

229
00:13:26,156 --> 00:13:27,792
唉 就那么几个人呗
Just to couple of people.

230
00:13:27,792 --> 00:13:31,270
问题是 他们会传给谁
Question is: who are they gonna send it to?

231
00:14:00,721 --> 00:14:02,225
哥几个 快过来看看
Hey, guys check this out.

232
00:14:04,528 --> 00:14:06,314
这俩姑娘 左边还是右边
Right or left.

233
00:14:06,314 --> 00:14:07,526
左边那个
***

234
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:08,810
右边还是左边
Right or left.

235
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:11,098
左边那个
*****

236
00:14:12,533 --> 00:14:13,621
右边还是左边
Right or left.

237
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:15,606
那是我室友
She's my room mate.

238
00:14:19,751 --> 00:14:21,178
悲剧啊
This is pathetic.

239
00:14:21,178 --> 00:14:23,071
奥尔布赖特
Albright?

240
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:32,181
他写了和你有关的博客
He blog about you.

241
00:14:32,686 --> 00:14:34,533
你一定不想看到的
You don't wanna read it.

242
00:14:38,475 --> 00:14:39,598
左边的
***

243
00:14:40,235 --> 00:14:41,095
还真是
*********

244
00:14:41,095 --> 00:14:46,495
艾瑞卡 这是你的内衣吗？ 我们从新生那里偷来的
Erika, is this yours? ***

245
00:14:46,495 --> 00:14:48,212
给我滚出去
***

246
00:14:59,618 --> 00:15:01,559
流量真大啊
Awful lot of traffic.

247
00:15:02,923 --> 00:15:06,156
你说我们是不是在它出事前收手啊
You think maybe we should shut it down before get into trouble.

248
00:15:15,144 --> 00:15:15,982
喂
Hello?

249
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,953
慢点说 什么事
Wa-wait... what?

250
00:15:21,704 --> 00:15:22,735
在凌晨四点？
At 4 in the morning?

251
00:15:22,735 --> 00:15:25,738
有个流量异常网站
Well, this very an usual amount of traffic to the switch of Kirkland.

252
00:15:25,738 --> 00:15:28,282
不正常是说凌晨四点不该有那个流量吗
You're saying it's unusual for 4 in the morning?

253
00:15:28,282 --> 00:15:31,294
不 就算是在超级碗比赛中场休息时 这个流量也不正常
No, this should be unusual for half time at the superbowl.

254
00:15:32,105 --> 00:15:33,239
好吧
Alright.

255
00:15:36,524 --> 00:15:37,518
我有点急事
I'm gonna go in.

256
00:15:38,423 --> 00:15:39,836
怎么了？
What's goin' on?

257
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:42,614
哈佛的网络要瘫痪了
Harvard network is about to crash.

258
00:15:49,018 --> 00:15:50,362
你说不会是…
You don't think...

259
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:52,998
没错
I do...

260
00:15:54,055 --> 00:15:55,509
看看别人的吧
Go to see if it's everybody...

261
00:16:01,871 --> 00:16:02,935
都连不上
I can't comin'

262
00:16:04,415 --> 00:16:05,729
网络瘫痪了
The network's down.

263
00:16:06,453 --> 00:16:08,758
如果不是巧合 我觉得这就是我们干的
Unless, it's coincidence, I think this is us.

264
00:16:08,758 --> 00:16:10,478
这不是巧合
It's not a coincidence.

265
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:12,713
妈的
Holy shit...

266
00:16:16,567 --> 00:16:18,126
你就这样被校委会叫去谈话
So you were called in front of the Ad Board.

267
00:16:18,126 --> 00:16:19,286
不是那样的
That's not what happen.

268
00:16:19,286 --> 00:16:21,481
你没被校委会叫去啊
You weren't called in front of the Administrator Board?

269
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:24,742
我是说 在之前 我和艾瑞卡在酒吧那一晚
No, back, I mean... that's, back at the bar with Erica Albright.

270
00:16:24,742 --> 00:16:25,803
- 她那么说吗 - 马克
- She said all that? - Mark.

271
00:16:25,803 --> 00:16:27,113
我跟她说了那样的话吗
That I said that stuff to her.

272
00:16:27,113 --> 00:16:29,324
我就是在读她的证词啊
I was reading from the transcript for the deposition.

273
00:16:29,324 --> 00:16:30,717
你们究竟为什么要她作证啊？
Why we do even need to depose her?

274
00:16:30,717 --> 00:16:32,384
这是我们的事
That really for us to decide.

275
00:16:32,384 --> 00:16:34,361
你觉得如果她把我说的像个混蛋
Miss, You think if I know she can make me look like a jerk.

276
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:35,821
- 我就会妥协的话 你错了 - 马克…
- I'll be more likely to settle. - Mark...

277
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:38,099
我们休息一下 可以吗
Why don't we stretch our legs for a minute, can we do that?

278
00:16:38,099 --> 00:16:39,699
都连着3个小时了
It's been almost 3 hours.

279
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:41,826
老实说你浪费了那么多时间
And frankly you did spend awful lot of the time...

280
00:16:41,826 --> 00:16:44,673
就想用一个女孩在酒吧的证词 让扎克伯格先生难堪吗？
Embarrassing Mr. Zuckerberg with the girl's testimony from the bar.

281
00:16:44,673 --> 00:16:46,617
我没觉得难堪 只是她说了很多假话
I'm not embarrassed. She just made a lot that up.

282
00:16:46,617 --> 00:16:47,678
她发过誓的
She was under oath.

283
00:16:47,678 --> 00:16:50,373
我猜她不是第一个发了誓以后做伪证的吧
I guess there would be the first time somebody's lies under oath.

284
00:17:01,381 --> 00:17:04,295
两个小时内点击率就有两千两百多吗
You got 22 hundred hits within 2 hours?

285
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:06,372
- 万 - 什么
- Thousands. - What?

286
00:17:07,922 --> 00:17:09,848
两万两千次
Twenty-two *thousands*.

287
00:17:30,312 --> 00:17:32,388
他们真快啊
These guys are pretty fast.

288
00:17:37,937 --> 00:17:40,005
有人能让这比赛公平点吗？
Sure anybody make this a fair fight?

289
00:17:40,824 --> 00:17:42,276
咱们跳进水里 游过去
Jump up and swim.

290
00:17:43,018 --> 00:17:44,954
跳进去我们就淹死了
I think we'd have to jump up and drowned.

291
00:17:45,378 --> 00:17:48,007
要不你向前划 我向后
Or you could row forward, I could row backward.

292
00:17:48,481 --> 00:17:51,576
我们是双胞胎  科学上来说我们应该一样啊
We're genetically identical, science says we'd stay in the one place.

293
00:17:51,635 --> 00:17:53,270
老实划船吧
Just row the damn boat.

294
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:02,612
- 你听说了吗 - 什么
- You guys here about this? - What?

295
00:18:02,841 --> 00:18:06,566
两天前的晚上 一名科克兰的大二学生 用他的笔记本电脑弄瘫了网络
Two nights ago, a sophomore shut network from laptop at Kirkland.

296

297
00:18:08,577 --> 00:18:09,222

He set up a website, where you vote on the hotness female undergrads.

What were we doing that none of us heard about this?

300
00:18:15,017 --> 00:18:17,931
忘了 好像是早饭前三个小时皮艇训练
*** Three hours rows before breakfast.

301
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:22,011
然后就去看书学习了
For course... Studying. ***

302
00:18:22,012 --> 00:18:23,350
之后在泳池泡了三个小时 又继续学习 也不知道怎么就错过了
***

303
00:18:23,842 --> 00:18:25,069
那网站受欢迎吗？
How much activity was on those thing?

304
00:18:25,069 --> 00:18:27,673
两万两千的流量
Twenty two thousands pages request.

305
00:18:27,698 --> 00:18:28,945
两万两千次？

这哥们黑了七栋楼的照片库
This guy hack the facebook from 7 houses.

307
00:18:31,556 --> 00:18:34,201
一晚上就建起了网站 当时他还喝醉了
He set up the whole site in 1 night. And he did it while he was drunk.

308
00:18:34,201 --> 00:18:35,493
两万两千
Twenty two thousands?

309
00:18:36,227 --> 00:18:37,038
你怎么知道他醉了
How do you know his drunk?

310
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:40,215
他一边做网站 还一边写博客
He was blogging simultaneously,

311
00:18:40,215 --> 00:18:42,635
- 你知道我怎么想的吗 - 说啊
- You know what I think? - I'm way ahead of you

312
00:18:42,892 --> 00:18:44,205
我们应该把他拉进来
This is our guy.

313
00:18:45,235 --> 00:18:51,212

Before we begin with our questioning you're allowed to make a statement, would you like to do so?

320
00:19:20,734 --> 00:19:27,597

I've, You know, I've already apologize to the Crimson, to the ABHW...

我觉得委员会应该给予我一些认可才对
I believe I deserve some recognition from this board.

324

325
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,453
没错
Yes.

326
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:47,289
- 我不懂 - 哪里不懂
- I don't understand... - Which part?

327
00:19:47,948 --> 00:19:49,668
你凭什么值得认可

328
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:52,543
我发现了你们安全系统中许多严重的漏洞

And I can assure you of its sophistication.

332
00:20:03,129 --> 00:20:07,091
正是因为它优异的性能 我们在4个小时内就找到了你
In fact it was that level of sophistification that led us to you in for less than 4 hours.

333
00:20:07,091 --> 00:20:08,633
- 4个小时 - 没错

335
00:20:11,087 --> 00:20:13,089
那还算挺快的
You would've seen it written on my dorm room window.

336
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:21,640
- 那结果是 - 留校察看六个月
- So? - Six month academic probation.

337
00:20:22,164 --> 00:20:25,717

- Well, they making an example out of you. - They have my blog.

338
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,296

I shouldn't have write nothing about the farm animals. That was stupid.

339
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:32,116
不过我不就开个玩笑么 现在的人怎么一点幽默感都没有
But, I was kidding, for god sake. Doesn't anybody have some sense of humour?

340
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:34,000
当时告诉你停下的
But I tried to stop you.

341
00:20:34,352 --> 00:20:35,228
我知道
***

00:20:35,286 --> 00:20:38,631
你怎么做的 让所有女生都讨厌我们了
How do you do these thing, How you manage to get all girls to hate us.

343
00:20:38,631 --> 00:20:40,532
- 我当时怎么就没管住你 - 我知道
- Why do I let you... - I know.

344
00:20:40,729 --> 00:20:43,277
- 你不能那么做 - 爱德华多 够了
- Can't do that... - Eduardo, I said enough.

345
00:20:43,277 --> 00:20:44,986
让我们看一个例子
Ok, let's look at a sample problem...

346
00:20:45,496 --> 00:20:51,686
假设我们有一台电脑 16比特的虚拟地址 256字节的页面大小
Suppose we're given a computer with a 16-bit virtual address and a page size of 256 bytes.

347
00:20:52,173 --> 00:20:56,957
系统使用单级分页 列表起始地址是0x400
The system uses one-level page tables, which start at address 0x400.

348
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:00,234
可能16位系统有直接内存访问功能 无所谓 （你个混蛋）
Maybe you want to have DMA on your 16-bit system, who knows?

349
00:21:00,685 --> 00:21:03,871
前几个页面文件用于保存硬体标识等信息
The first few pages are reserved for hardware flags, etc.

350
00:21:03,885 --> 00:21:07,344
假定分页表头有八个状态位
Assume page table entries have eight status bits.

351
00:21:07,418 --> 00:21:10,931
这八个状态位是…有人知道吗？
The eight status bits would then be... Anybody?

352
00:21:13,207 --> 00:21:15,034
我看到第一个退出的人了
And I see we have our first surrender.

353
00:21:15,514 --> 00:21:18,796
没关系 扎克伯格先生 很多比你聪明的人也过不了这课
Don't worry, Mr. Zuckerberg, brighter men than you have tried and failed at this class.

354
00:21:18,796 --> 00:21:23,367
一个有效位 一个修改位 一个参考位  五个允许位
One valid bit, 1 modify bit, 1 reference bit and 5 permission bits.

355
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:27,270
答对了
That is correct.

356
00:21:27,718 --> 00:21:29,728
有人知道他怎么算的吗
***

357
00:21:35,455 --> 00:21:36,258
马克
Mark?

358
00:21:37,565 --> 00:21:38,736
你是马克?扎克伯格吗？
Are you Mark Zuckerberg?

359
00:21:38,736 --> 00:21:39,679
是我
Yeah.

360
00:21:40,042 --> 00:21:42,245

Are you guys related?

363
00:21:45,057 --> 00:21:46,109
- 不错 - 真有趣
- It's good. - Funny.

364
00:21:46,109 --> 00:21:47,402
第一次有人这么问
We never heard that before.

365
00:21:48,044 --> 00:21:50,123
找我有什么事 我冒犯你们的女朋友了吗
So what can I do for you? Did I insult your girlfriends?

366
00:21:50,123 --> 00:21:52,201
不 没有 说实话 我还真不知道
No, we didn't, Actually... I don't know.

367
00:21:52,201 --> 00:21:53,896
- 我们还没问过 - 或许是该问问了
- We never asked. - Maybe we should do that...

368
00:21:54,144 --> 00:21:57,423
我们有个想法想和你谈谈
** We have an idea we want to talk you about.

369
00:21:58,794 --> 00:21:59,481
有时间吗？
Do you have a minute?

370
00:21:59,481 --> 00:22:01,943
你们看起来好像经常去健身
You guys look like you spend some time at a gym.

371
00:22:02,663 --> 00:22:04,528
- 没办法 - 为什么
- We have to. - ***

372
00:22:04,528 --> 00:22:05,654
我们是赛艇队的
We row crew.

373
00:22:07,274 --> 00:22:09,386
- 那我应该有时间了 - 很好
- Yeah, I've got a minute. - ***

374
00:22:13,879 --> 00:22:15,733
- 你去过坡斯廉俱乐部吗？ - 没
- So you ever been in The Porcellian? - No

375
00:22:15,733 --> 00:22:18,619
好吧 那我们就在这吧 不是会员的话进不去的
Allright we gonna stay, we can't take you past the bike room 'cause you're not a member.

376
00:22:18,619 --> 00:22:19,703
我听说了
I've heard.

377
00:22:23,115 --> 00:22:24,450
来点三明治什么的吗
Wanna sandwich or something?

378
00:22:25,137 --> 00:22:25,906
好的
ok.

379
00:22:25,906 --> 00:22:27,492
- 你就是马克 - 对
- Mark, right? - yeah.

380
00:22:27,797 --> 00:22:29,810
- 马克 这是迪维亚?纳兰德亚 我们的搭档 - 你好
- Mark, this is Divya Narendra, our partner. - Hi.

381
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:31,819
你的Facemash让我们印象深刻
We were really impressed with facemash.

382
00:22:31,819 --> 00:22:34,413
我们查了下 你还创建了CourseMatch
And then we checked you out and you also built CourseMatch.

383
00:22:34,413 --> 00:22:35,273
我不知道什么CourseMatch
I don't know CourseMatch.

384
00:22:35,273 --> 00:22:37,642

428
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:27,901

It's not that guys like me are generally attracted to Asian girls.

但我们却迷上了亚洲女孩
It's that Asian girls are generally attracted to guys like me.

453
00:25:46,494 --> 00:25:47,504
失陪下
***

454
00:25:55,467 --> 00:25:56,354
我想到个点子

只是四步程序的第一步
I mean it's just the first of the 4 step process,

459
00:26:06,812 --> 00:26:09,441
他们周一把邀请函塞到我门缝里
But they slipped the invitation under my door tonight.

460
00:26:09,441 --> 00:26:11,710
明天我就要第一次参加派对了
I go to the first punch party tomorrow.

461
00:26:13,492 --> 00:26:15,059
凤凰俱乐部邀请你了？
You got punch by The Phoenix.

462
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:18,361
没错 它可能真是个多元化的俱乐部
Yeah, probably, it was just a diversity thing.

463
00:26:18,621 --> 00:26:20,958
没错 就是 我还会这样特立独行下去
It was just a diversity thing. I'll just ride that horse until...

464
00:26:20,958 --> 00:26:22,401
你要跟我说什么来着
What did you want to talk about?

465
00:26:23,027 --> 00:26:24,205
- 马克 - 怎么

468
00:26:27,792 --> 00:26:29,360
外面才20度
It's 20 degrees outside.

469
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:33,873
我受不了那个尼亚加拉大瀑布 它和加勒比海有什么关系啊
I can't stare to that loop of Niagara falls which has absolutely nothing to do with the Caribbean.

470
00:26:45,531 --> 00:26:47,562
人们会争着上Facemash的对吧
People came to Facemash in a stampede, right?

471
00:26:47,562 --> 00:26:48,089
没错
Yeah.

472
00:26:48,089 --> 00:26:49,957
但这并不是因为他们想看美女
But it wasn't because the saw pictures of hot girls.

473
00:26:49,957 --> 00:26:51,949
因为在网上美女的照片到处都是
You can go any around on the internet and see pictures of hot girls.

474
00:26:51,949 --> 00:26:52,470
没错
Yeah.

475
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:55,347
这是因为他们能看到认识女生的照片
That was because they saw pictures of girls that they knew.

476
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,350
大家想上网看看他们的朋友
People wanna go on the internet and check out their friends,

477
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,811
为什么我们不创建这样一个网站呢
So why not build the website that offers that?

478
00:26:59,811 --> 00:27:03,683
你可以随意浏览朋友照片 简介之类的信息
Friends, pictures, profiles, whatever you can visit, browse around.

479
00:27:03,683 --> 00:27:07,269
甚至能访问你在派对刚认识的女孩 我说的不是那种交友网站
Maybe its someone you just met at a party. But I'm not talkin' about a dating site.

480
00:27:07,269 --> 00:27:12,916
我指的是 将整个大学的社交网络弄到网上去
I'm talkin' about taking the entire social experience of college and putting it online.

481
00:27:13,086 --> 00:27:14,030
我腿没感觉了
I can't feel my legs

482
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:17,329
这太让人兴奋了 爱德华多
I know, I'm totally psyched about this. But Wardo...

483
00:27:17,329 --> 00:27:20,424
- 好 - 它是独一无二的
- Yeah... - It would be exclusive.

484
00:27:20,457 --> 00:27:23,449
你必须认识网上那个人 才会同意他访问你的页面
You would've to know the people on the site to get pass thru on page.

485
00:27:23,449 --> 00:27:27,050
- 就像收到邀请一样 - 不错
- Like getting punched. - That's good

486
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:29,451
这就像终极俱乐部一样 不同的是我们是主席
Wardo, it's like a Final Clubs except we're the president.

487
00:27:30,002 --> 00:27:32,069
我跟他说了 这是个好主意
I told him i thought it sounded great.

488
00:27:33,541 --> 00:27:34,787
这是个伟大的想法
It was a great idea.

489
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,040
用不着去偷
There's nothing to hack.

490
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:39,029
人们会上传自己的照片 填写自己的资料
People were gonna provide their own pictures, their own information.

491
00:27:39,029 --> 00:27:44,251
还可以选择否邀请自己的好友加入这个网络
And people had the ability to invite or not invite their friends to join.

492
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:47,485
就像一个完全由社会网络构成的东西
See, in the world were the social structure was everything.

493
00:27:48,742 --> 00:27:50,340
它就是那样一个东西
That was the "THING".

494
00:27:50,747 --> 00:27:52,140
这是个大工程
It was a big project.

495
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:55,234
他要为此编写成千上万行代码
And he was going to have to write ten of thousands of lines of code.

496
00:27:55,234 --> 00:27:57,854
我当时还想 为什么是他 而不是他室友来找我
So I wonder, why he was coming to me and not to his room mate.

497
00:27:57,854 --> 00:28:00,840
达斯汀?摩斯克维茨 和克里斯?休斯都是程序员
Dustin Moskowitz and Chris Hughes they're programmers.

498
00:28:01,003 --> 00:28:04,246
我们当时需要一点资金 租个服务器传到网上去
We're gonna need a little start-up cash to rent the servers and get it online.

499
00:28:05,468 --> 00:28:06,271
那就是原因
So that was why.

500
00:28:06,271 --> 00:28:08,357
- 他提条件了吗 - 当然
- Did he offers terms? - Yes.

501
00:28:08,357 --> 00:28:10,175
我们分成 三七开
We'll split it. 70-30

502
00:28:10,175 --> 00:28:12,927
我拿七成 你拿三成 你负责投资上千的美金
Seventy for me, Thirty for you for you, putting up a thousands dollar.

503
00:28:12,927 --> 00:28:15,212
还有处理一切生意上的事情 你做首席财务官
And for handling everything on the business end. You're CFO

504
00:28:15,397 --> 00:28:17,794
- 你怎么说 - 我说 大展身手吧
- And you said? - I said "Let's do it"

505
00:28:17,794 --> 00:28:21,556
- 好的 他还说了什么没有 - 有
- Ok, did he add anything else? - Yes.

506
00:28:24,955 --> 00:28:27,315
也许是个多元的俱乐部
It probably was a diversity thing

507
00:28:28,929 --> 00:28:29,985
但又如何呢
but so what?

508
00:28:30,301 --> 00:28:31,449
你觉得他为什么要这么说
Why do you think he said that?

509
00:28:31,449 --> 00:28:33,801
格雷琴 抱歉打断你 但这又是谁的发现呢
Gretchen, excuse me for interrupting, But whose discovery it is?

510
00:28:33,801 --> 00:28:36,289
- 塞 如果你让我继续问下去的话… - 你又想暗示什么
- Sy, if you let me continue with my line of question... - What do you suggesting?

511
00:28:36,289 --> 00:28:39,168
他们在暗示我嫉妒爱德华多 被凤凰俱乐部邀请了
They're suggesting I was jealous of Eduardo for getting punched by Phoenix.

512
00:28:39,168 --> 00:28:41,888
于是决定设计把他排挤出 一个我还没设立的公司
and began a plan to screw him out of the company I haven't even invented yet.

513
00:28:41,888 --> 00:28:42,700
- 不是吗 - 格雷琴…
- Were you? - Gretchen...

514
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,944
我嫉妒爱德华多？
Jealous of Eduardo?

515
00:28:43,944 --> 00:28:45,296
哦 别记下来 这话不用记录
Oh, stop typing, we're off the record.

516
00:28:45,296 --> 00:28:46,348
女士 我知道你好好调查了一番
Maam, I know you've done your home work.

517
00:28:46,348 --> 00:28:48,239
所以说你肯定知道钱并非是我生活的重心
And so you know that money isn't a big part of my life,

518
00:28:48,239 --> 00:28:50,052
但现在我可以买下整条奥本大街
But at the moment I could buy I could buy Mt. Auburn Street,

519
00:28:50,052 --> 00:28:53,106
买下凤凰俱乐部 再把它变成我的乒乓室
Take the Phoenix Club and turn it into my pingpong room.

520
00:28:57,647 --> 00:28:59,352
回头告诉你派对的情况
I'll let you know how the party is,

521
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:10,472
我们发现您在涉及Facebook的案件中 一起是原告 一起是证人
We recognize that you're a plaintiff in one suit involving Facebook and a witness in another.

522
00:29:10,472 --> 00:29:12,724
- 是的 先生 - 在马克告诉你他的想法
- Yes, Sir. - At any time In the weeks,

523
00:29:12,724 --> 00:29:14,259
之前的几周内
prior to Mark telling you his idea,

524
00:29:14,259 --> 00:29:19,480
他有没有提起过泰勒和卡梅隆?温克艾沃斯 迪维亚?纳兰德拉或者是"哈佛关系网"？
Did he mention Tyler Winklevoss, Cameron Winklevoss, Divya Narendra or HarvardConnection?

525
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:22,301
有 他说他们邀请他去建设他们的网站
Yes. He said they'd asked him to work on their site.

526
00:29:22,433 --> 00:29:25,824
但是他一看到他们的成果后 就觉得不值得他花时间去做
But that he'd looked at what they had and decided it wasn't worth his time.

527
00:29:26,358 --> 00:29:31,743
他说哪怕是他最烂的朋友都比这些人要懂得如何使一个网站吸引人
He said even his most pathetic friends knew more about getting people interested in a website than these guys.

528
00:29:31,912 --> 00:29:33,749
"这些人" 指的是我的客户们
"These guys" meaning my clients.

529
00:29:33,749 --> 00:29:37,520
对 他很讨厌 马克很讨厌他们 就是你的客户们
Yes. He resented, Mark resented that they, that your clients,

530
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,714
觉得他在经历了Facemash事件后 需要恢复形象
thought that he need to rehabilitate his image after the Facemash thing

531
00:29:40,714 --> 00:29:42,233
但其实马克什么都不想恢复
but Mark didn't want to rehabilitate anything.

532
00:29:42,233 --> 00:29:46,946
他用Facemash黑了哈佛的电脑系统 进入了董事会的系统内
With Facemash he'd hack into Harvard computers, he dumps his nose to the Ad Board.

533
00:29:46,946 --> 00:29:50,500
声誉满载 Facemash成就了 他梦寐以求的一切
He got a lot of honorarity. Facemash did exactly what he wanted it to do.

534
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,422
您是否知道 在建设Facebook的同时
Were you aware that while Mr. Zuckerberg was building the Facebook,

535
00:29:53,422 --> 00:29:55,349
扎克伯格先生在同原告接触？
He was also communicating with the plaintiffs?

536
00:29:55,349 --> 00:29:57,901
那时候我还不知道 但是…
Not at the time I wasn't. But...

537
00:29:59,503 --> 00:30:02,289
我知道他没有忙着搞 温克艾沃斯兄弟的交友网站
It really didn't have much to do with The Winkelvoss dating site.

538
00:30:02,289 --> 00:30:04,490
你怎么知道的 你都没有…
How would you know? You' weren't even...

539
00:30:04,923 --> 00:30:07,927
您是否知道 扎克伯格先生 在建设Facebook的同时
Were you aware that while Mr. Zuckerberg was building TheFacebook,

540
00:30:07,927 --> 00:30:11,249
他误导原告使之相信 他是在建设"哈佛关系网"？
He was leading the plaintiffs to believe he was building HarvardConnection?

541
00:30:11,249 --> 00:30:13,186
你这是没有证据 臆推结论
You're offering a conclusion not found an evidence.

542
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:15,248
现在我就给你看证据…
We are about to finding an evidence...

543
00:30:16,328 --> 00:30:20,562
这封是马克?扎克伯格于2003年11月30日发给泰勒?温克艾沃斯的邮件

I read over all the stuff you sent me re-HarvardConnection,

545
00:30:23,547 --> 00:30:26,183
看上去不需要花很多时间就能完成了
and it seems like it shouldn't take too long to implement,

546
00:30:26,183 --> 00:30:30,763
等我明晚准备好所有基础设备 我们再仔细谈谈"

"This week has been pretty busy thus far with classes and work"

552
00:30:49,909 --> 00:30:52,497
所以我觉得还是推迟会面吧"
"So I think it's probably best to postpone the meeting."

553
00:30:52,497 --> 00:30:55,235
"明天我也很忙"
"I'm also really busy tomorrow"

554
00:30:55,398 --> 00:30:58,214
好吧 大伙儿有没有觉得这家伙有点奇怪？
***

555
00:30:58,952 --> 00:31:03,158
告诉他可以 但是我们必须 在休假前碰一次面
Tell him okay but we do have to make sure that we meet up before we all head off for break.

556
00:31:03,371 --> 00:31:05,618

I need a dedicated Linux box running Apache with a mySQL back-end.

559
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,873
这要花多点小钱
It's gonna cost a little more money.

560
00:31:42,873 --> 00:31:44,866
- 大概要多多少？ - 大概要多200
- How much more? - About 200 more.

561
00:31:45,454 --> 00:31:48,361

- Do we need it? - Gotta handle the traffic.

562
00:31:51,099 --> 00:31:52,640

563
00:31:57,575 --> 00:31:58,819
嘿 你猜怎么着
Hey guess what...

564
00:32:00,259 --> 00:32:01,665
我进了第二轮了
I'm in the 2nd cut.

565
00:32:02,577 --> 00:32:04,711
很好啊 你该自豪了
That's good. You should be proud of that right there,

566
00:32:04,711 --> 00:32:06,729
要是没晋级千万别难过
Don't worry if you don't make it any further.

567
00:32:12,298 --> 00:32:13,571
我这就走
I'll get out of here.

568

December 15, 2003.

570
00:32:19,635 --> 00:32:22,295
我有个代码段出了问题 我这才着手解决
I have a cs problem set that I'm just getting started with,

571
00:32:22,295 --> 00:32:25,591

礼拜三下午我也不能来了
I have to cancel Wednesday afternoon.

574
00:32:31,539 --> 00:32:34,516
这段时间我一直混在实验室里 而且…
I've basically been in the lab this whole time and also...

575
00:32:34,516 --> 00:32:39,318
礼拜六也不行 我要去见我爹娘
Won't be able to do it Saturday as I have to meet up with my parents...

576
00:32:43,303 --> 00:32:48,095
石板上写着 这位是约翰?哈佛 他于1638年创建了哈佛大学
As the plaque reads, this is John Harvard, founder of Harvard University in 1638.

577
00:32:48,204 --> 00:32:50,749
这也被称为三大谎言雕像
It's also called The Statue of Three Lies.

578
00:32:51,201 --> 00:32:53,752
那三大谎言是什么呢
What are the three lies?

579
00:32:53,823 --> 00:32:55,119
道得先生
Mr. Dowd.

580
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:56,405
三大谎言
The three lies,

581
00:32:56,405 --> 00:32:58,576
一…该死
First... Shit!

582
00:32:58,576 --> 00:33:00,720
- 把裤子脱了 - 我早知道
- Take your pants off. - I know.

583
00:33:01,738 --> 00:33:03,089
萨佛林先生
Mr. Saverin.

584
00:33:03,089 --> 00:33:06,668
一 哈佛于1636年创建 而非1638
1) Harvard was founded in 1636 not 1638.

585
00:33:06,668 --> 00:33:09,247
二 哈佛的创始人并非约翰?哈佛
2) Harvard was not founded by John Harvard

586
00:33:09,247 --> 00:33:10,630
还有 这不是约翰?哈佛的雕像
and 3) That's not John Harvard.

587
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:11,882
那他又是谁？
Who is it?

588
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:16,611
雕…雕塑家的好友 丹尼尔…切斯特
F-friend of the sculptor, Daniel... Chester.

589
00:33:17,532 --> 00:33:18,662
把外套穿上吧
Keep you jacket on.

590
00:33:22,253 --> 00:33:25,847
继与我客户们的首次见面的39天之后
39 days after Mr. Zuckerberg's initial meeting with my clients

591
00:33:25,847 --> 00:33:29,192
扎克伯格先生依然没有完成 建设"哈佛关系网"的工作
And he still hadn't completed work on HarvardConnection.

592
00:33:29,192 --> 00:33:32,220
但是在2004年1月11日
But On January 11, 2004

593
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:39,094
扎克伯格先生在Network Solution上注册了Facebook的域名
Mr. Zuckerberg registered the domain name the facebook by Network Solution.

594
00:33:40,147 --> 00:33:43,859
请问您是否知道 他到底有没有 着手建设"哈佛关系网"？
To the best of your knowledge, had he even begun work on HarvardConnection?

595
00:33:45,021 --> 00:33:47,479
据我所知 没有
Not to my knowledge. No.

596
00:33:54,730 --> 00:34:00,179
嗨 卡梅隆 "我依然怀疑 我们网站的功能够不够吸引
Hi Cameroon, "I'm still a little skeptical that we have enough functionality in the site to really draw the attention

597
00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:03,817
并获得维系网站的评论关注"
And gain the critical mass necessary to get a site like this to run"

598
00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:06,353
我们来日再谈？
We'll speak soon?

599
00:34:08,576 --> 00:34:11,374
这是否为第一次他提出困难？
This is the first time he mentioned any problem?

600
00:34:11,374 --> 00:34:12,002
是的
Yes, he was

601
00:34:12,002 --> 00:34:16,882
你们共给扎克伯格先生发了36封电邮 收到了16封回复
You'd sent 36 e-mails to Mr. Zuckerberg and received 16 e-mails in return,

602
00:34:16,882 --> 00:34:19,660
而这是第一次他提到自己不太乐意
And this was the first time he indicated that he's not happy.

603
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:20,563
没错
That's correct!

604
00:34:20,563 --> 00:34:23,408
他花了42天来研究我们的系统 然后捷足先登
He had 42 days to study our system and get out ahead...

605
00:34:23,408 --> 00:34:25,079
你看到Facebook上有一条你的代码吗
Do you see any of your code on Facebook?

606
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:27,263
- 塞 - 我用了你们的代码吗
- *** - Did I use any of your code?

607
00:34:27,263 --> 00:34:29,070
你偷的他妈的是我们整个创意
You stole our whole god damn idea.

608
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,080
伙计们
Fellas,

609
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,974
- 哈佛人上的交友网站啊 - 我能继续读证据材料吗
- What a match-dot-com for Harvard guys! - Can I continue with my deposition

610
00:34:32,974 --> 00:34:35,813
你们真的不必请一个鉴证组来调查
You know you really don't need a forensic team to get to bottom of this

611
00:34:35,813 --> 00:34:40,434
如果你们觉得自己是Facebook的创建者 你们得创造出一个Facebook来
If you guys were the inventors of Facebook you'd have invented Facebook.

612
00:34:41,601 --> 00:34:44,957
我真等不及踩扁你 等你赔偿了
I can't wait to stand over your shoulder while you write us a check.

613
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:46,141
才怪
No Shit.

614
00:34:47,641 --> 00:34:48,886
继续吧
Let's continue.

615
00:34:50,465 --> 00:34:53,581
2004年2月4日
February 4, 2004

616
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:59,304
马克… 马克…
Mark... Mark...

617
00:34:59,729 --> 00:35:03,303
你艺术史课上有个女生 叫斯蒂芬妮?艾提丝
There is a girl in your art history class name Stephanie Attis.

618
00:35:03,303 --> 00:35:05,387
你知不知道她有没有男朋友啊
Do you happen to know if she has a boyfriend?

619
00:35:07,034 --> 00:35:09,267
你有没有看到过她跟别人在一起？
Have you ever seen her with anyone.

620
00:35:10,793 --> 00:35:15,234
要是没有的话 你知不知道 她想不想找一个男朋友？
And if not, do you happen to know if she's looking to go out with anyone?

621
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:20,372
人们又不在胸口挂牌 告诉别人…
People don't walk around with a sign on them that says some...

622
00:35:25,235 --> 00:35:26,114
马克？
***

623
00:35:52,991 --> 00:35:54,197
我们该9点碰头的
We were supposed to meet at 9

624
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:57,458
- 你有睡过觉么 - 我要加点东西上去
- Have you slept yet? - I've to add something.

625
00:35:58,197 --> 00:35:58,942
什么
What?

626
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:12,378
哇 这看上去不错 这看上去真的不错
Shit that's look good, That's look really good.

627
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:15,932
简单了当 不花哨
It's clean and simple, no disneyland...

628
00:36:15,932 --> 00:36:16,965
但是看着
But watch...

629
00:36:18,326 --> 00:36:19,311
你写了什么
What'd you write?

630
00:36:20,098 --> 00:36:22,972
感情状态 对某人感兴趣
Relationship status, Interested in,

631
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:26,151
这就是大学生活的动力所在 你是否在与人上床
This is what drives live in college. Are you having sex or aren't you

632
00:36:26,151 --> 00:36:28,712
有的人上某些课 只是为了坐在那个位置上
It's why people take certain classes. And sit where they sit.

633
00:36:28,712 --> 00:36:31,366
做他们所做的事情 这才是重点 你懂的
And do what they do, and it's um, centre, you know,

634
00:36:31,366 --> 00:36:33,453
Facebook就是要做这样的事情
That what's thefacebook is gonna be about...

635
00:36:33,453 --> 00:36:34,304
大家来登录
People gonna log on...

636
00:36:34,304 --> 00:36:36,807
除了那些好看的噱头 这里还包含着潜在实际的
Because after all the cake and watermelon, there's a chance they're actually gonna...

637
00:36:36,807 --> 00:36:39,295
- 上床机会… - 泡个妞 对
- Get laid... - Meet a girl. Yes.

638
00:36:39,295 --> 00:36:41,974

He knows what apparently you don't which is that getting there first is everything.

He's gonna look at all this if he thinks it's appropriate he'll send a cease and desist letter.

725
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:26,378

Whatever, I'm saying let's calm down until we know what we're talking about.

732
00:41:39,686 --> 00:41:41,905
你还要等多少资料
how much more information are you waiting for.

好吧 听着
Ok, look...

739
00:41:55,728 --> 00:41:58,040

...would help to restore his reputation following student outrage over Facemash.com"

That's exactly what we said to him. He's giving us "the finger" in the Crimson

742
00:42:07,378 --> 00:42:10,477
我们这么干坐着等老爸的律师来处理 我们至少该写点什么反驳…
While we're waiting for dad's lawyer to look this stuff over, we can at least...

743
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:11,994

这没什么好争的!
***

745
00:42:13,238 --> 00:42:16,925
我们不能跟他打笔仗 也不能起诉他
We're not starting a knife fight in the Crimson and we're not suing anybody.

746
00:42:16,925 --> 00:42:18,119
为什么
Why not?

747
00:42:20,217 --> 00:42:21,823
我不明白 为什么不能
***

748
00:42:23,254 --> 00:42:24,734
他会说我蠢的

因为我们是哈佛的绅士
Because we're gentlemen of Harvard.

这里是哈佛 不能说别人坏话 也不能起诉别人
This is Harvard. Where you don't plant stories and you don't sue people.

753
00:42:36,673 --> 00:42:39,358

You thought he was going to be the only one who thought that was stupid?

754
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:42,617
当时你说自己有这个想法
During the time when you say you had this idea,

00:43:00,206 --> 00:43:02,134
我不知道他们家有没有钱
I had no idea whether they came from money or not.

764
00:43:02,134 --> 00:43:07,648
在一封你给纳兰德拉先生的电邮里 你提到了一家叫泰特?温克艾沃斯的投资顾问公司
In one of your e-mails to Mr. Narendra you reference Tate Winklevoss consulting firm.

765
00:43:07,648 --> 00:43:08,695
你说有就有了
If you say so.

766
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:12,649
霍华德?温克艾沃斯创建了这家公司 市值上亿
Howard Winklevoss founded the firm and its assets are in the hundreds of millions.

767
00:43:12,683 --> 00:43:17,646
你还知道泰勒及卡梅隆是 哈佛终极俱乐部坡斯廉的成员
You also knew that Tyler and Cameron were members of a Harvard Final club called the Porcellian.

768
00:43:17,646 --> 00:43:20,257
- 他们对我说过了 - 抱歉我们邀请你了
- They pointed that out? - Excuse us for inviting you in.

769
00:43:20,257 --> 00:43:21,583
请我去停车库
To the bike room...

770
00:43:22,197 --> 00:43:25,328
所以说 可以认为 你是知道我的客户们很有钱了
So it's safe to say you were aware that my clients had money?

771
00:43:27,172 --> 00:43:29,126
- 是的 - 我来告诉你为什么要这么问
- Yes. - Let me tell you why I'm asking.

772
00:43:29,126 --> 00:43:30,254
我在想
I'm wondering why...

773
00:43:30,254 --> 00:43:34,458
当你的互联网生意需要1000美金投资时 你为什么没有问我的客户们要
If you needed a $1000 for an internet venture you didn't ask my clients for it.

774
00:43:34,458 --> 00:43:37,142
他们会告诉你其中的利弊…
They'd demonstrated to you an interest in this kind of thing...

775
00:43:37,142 --> 00:43:40,030
我去问我的朋友要钱投资是因为我想让他成为我的合伙人
I went to my friend for the money because that he's who I wanted to be partners with...

776
00:43:40,238 --> 00:43:44,534
爱德华多是哈佛投资者协会的主席 同时也是我的挚交好友
Eduardo was presidents of the Harvard Inverstors Association and he was also my best friend.

777
00:43:45,693 --> 00:43:49,572
你的挚交好友正起诉你 问你要6亿美金呢
Your best friend is suing you for 600 million dollars.

778
00:43:49,572 --> 00:43:51,557
我不知道 你来告诉我吧
I didn't know that. tell me more!

779
00:43:51,557 --> 00:43:54,237
爱德华多 首次发布之后情况如何
Eduardo, what happen after the initial lunch?

780
00:43:54,237 --> 00:43:56,681
塞 能否称呼我的客户为萨佛林先生
Sy would you mind addressing as Mr. Saverin

781
00:43:56,681 --> 00:43:58,603
- 格雷琴 他们是挚交好友 - 不再是了
- Gretchen, they're best friend - Not anymore

782
00:43:58,603 --> 00:44:00,014
我之前就已经…
I already went through this on the...

783
00:44:00,068 --> 00:44:01,622
算了 萨佛林先生…
Nevermind, Mr. Saverin...

784
00:44:01,622 --> 00:44:03,481
首次发布之后情况如何
***

785
00:44:03,481 --> 00:44:06,483
简直就和爆炸一样 校园里所有人都在用
It's exploded, everybody on campus was using it

786
00:44:06,483 --> 00:44:10,299
两个礼拜之后 大家见面就说 "上Facebook加我"
"Facebook-me" was the common expression after two weeks.

787
00:44:10,299 --> 00:44:11,962
而马克呢
and Mark...

788
00:44:11,962 --> 00:44:16,107
马克成了校园里最闪亮的人物 一举击败了19位诺贝尔获奖者
And Mark was biggest thing on a campus that included 19 Nobel Laureates,

789
00:44:16,107 --> 00:44:19,795
15位普利策奖获得者 两位未来的奥林匹克冠军
15 Pulitzer Prize Winners, two future Olympians

790
00:44:19,795 --> 00:44:20,912
和一位电影明星
and a movie star.

791
00:44:20,912 --> 00:44:22,165
电影明星是谁
Who's the movie star?

792
00:44:22,616 --> 00:44:23,608
有关系吗
Does it matter?

793
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:24,900
没有
No.

794
00:44:33,739 --> 00:44:36,291
那天天气很好 我去了位于拉德克利夫的宿舍
Beautiful day. And I was up in my Radcliffe dorm.

795
00:44:36,291 --> 00:44:38,068
他带了那本杂志给我看
He brought that magazine up and he saw it to me

796
00:44:38,068 --> 00:44:41,863
他说"看 再不动手就轮不到我们了"
And he said, "Look, it's gonna happen without us. We've got to start now."

797
00:44:42,488 --> 00:44:43,540
我说 "好吧"
And I said... "Okay."

798
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:46,000
我们去买基础硬体
Let's get basic hardware.

799
00:44:46,299 --> 00:44:48,929
许多人都以为自己知道后续的事情 但其实并非如此
Most of you think you know the rest of story that you may not.

800
00:44:48,929 --> 00:44:51,389
开始挺寒酸的
The beginning of the industry were very humble...

801
00:44:51,483 --> 00:44:55,700
那台杂志封面上的组装机上 搭载的是8080处理器
That kit computer on the cover of that magazine, had an 8080 processor in it.

802
00:44:55,700 --> 00:45:00,065
除非你再加钱买一个1K内存扩展板 不然的话只有256比特的储存空间
Unless you paid extra for 1K memory board 256bits,

803
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:04,807
所以我们的挑战并非是 运行一台4K比特的电脑
so the challenges *** but,

804
00:45:04,807 --> 00:45:09,128
而是要留下运行程序的空间
****

805
00:45:10,326 --> 00:45:13,300
你的朋友 是叫马克?扎克伯格吗
*** Isn't that Mark Zuckerberg?

806
00:45:13,479 --> 00:45:14,175
对
Yeah

807
00:45:14,175 --> 00:45:16,743
- 他创造了Facebook？ - 对
- He made facebook? - Yeah.

808
00:45:16,743 --> 00:45:21,000
我是说我们俩创造了 对 我们… 对
I mean both of us. Yeah, we... yes.

809
00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:24,395
酷 我叫克里斯蒂?李 这位是爱丽丝
Cool. I'm Christy Lee. This is Alice.

810
00:45:24,395 --> 00:45:25,455
嗨
hi.

811
00:45:25,949 --> 00:45:27,807
很高兴见到你们
Nice to meet you

812
00:45:28,198 --> 00:45:31,386
回家后上Facebook加我 我们出去喝一杯
Facebook-me when you get home We can all go out and grab a drink.

813
00:45:31,819 --> 00:45:34,522
当然了 我一定会的
Certainly, absolutely will do that.

814
00:45:41,449 --> 00:45:44,806
她说"上Facebook加我" 还有我们出去喝一杯
She said "Facebook-me" and we can all go for a drink later.

815
00:45:44,806 --> 00:45:46,597
有两个理由 为什么这句话太棒了
Which is stunningly great for two reasons.

816
00:45:46,597 --> 00:45:49,234
首先 她说"上Facebook加我" 对么？ 然后…
One she said "Facebook-me". Right? And the other...

817
00:45:49,234 --> 00:45:50,238
- 她们想要出去喝杯 - 对
- They wanna have drinks later. - Yes

818
00:45:50,238 --> 00:45:53,533
你有听到过一句话里 有这么多好事儿吗
Have you ever heard so many different good things packed into one regular-sized sentence?

819
00:45:53,533 --> 00:45:54,850
抱歉 马克？
Excuse me. Mark?

820
00:45:55,798 --> 00:45:56,460
对
Yeah

821
00:45:57,111 --> 00:45:59,473
我是斯图尔特?辛格 我在你的操作系统实验室里
I'm Stuart Singer. I'm in your O.S. lab.

822
00:45:59,473 --> 00:46:00,505
对
Sure.

823
00:46:01,007 --> 00:46:03,393
- Facebook搞得真棒 - 太棒了
- Awesome job with theFacebook. - Awesome Job.

824
00:46:03,547 --> 00:46:05,240
- 谢谢 - 我叫鲍勃
- Thanks. - I'm Bob.

825
00:46:05,544 --> 00:46:06,972
- 你好 - 你知道 我发誓
- How are you doin'. - You know, I could swear..

826
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:10,468
他说这房间里有下一位比尔盖茨 当时他就看着你
he was looking at you when he said The next Bill Gates could be right in this room.

827
00:46:10,925 --> 00:46:12,102
不一定吧
I doubt it

828
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:14,728
我来晚了 我都不知道发言人是谁
I showed up late, I don't even know who the speaker was.

829
00:46:16,372 --> 00:46:17,664
就是比尔盖茨
It was Bill Gates.

830
00:46:19,029 --> 00:46:20,692
该死 这就说得通了
Shit... that's make sense.

831
00:46:21,869 --> 00:46:23,654
好吧 谢谢各位了
Alright, thanks guys.

832
00:46:26,755 --> 00:46:28,300
你傻了还是你脑残了？
Are you moron? Are you medically stupid?

833
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:30,319
比尔盖茨在你眼前 晃了一个小时你都没认出来？
You can't recognize Bill Gates in front of you for an hour?

834
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:32,298
现在马克?扎克伯格会觉得我们是拿了残奥会奖学金进的哈佛…
Mark Zuckerberg now thinks we got into Harvard on a dimwit scholarship.

835
00:46:32,298 --> 00:46:34,033
我要去找把格洛克毙了你
I'm gonna get a Glock...

836
00:46:36,063 --> 00:46:37,561
我们得把这东西套现了
It's time to monetize the thing.

837
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:38,795
他们是从哪儿来的
What are their natives?

838
00:46:39,186 --> 00:46:40,589
- 你听到我说的话了吗 - 什么话
- Did you heard what I just said? - When?

839
00:46:41,015 --> 00:46:43,172
我说是时候把网站套现了
I said it's times to monetize the site

840
00:46:43,976 --> 00:46:45,046
什么意思
What is that mean?

841
00:46:45,046 --> 00:46:47,908
意思说该让网站开始盈利了
It means time for the website generating the revenue.

842
00:46:47,908 --> 00:46:50,661
不 我知道那个词什么意思 我是问你要这么做
No, I know what the word means. I'm asking how do you want to do it?

843
00:46:51,652 --> 00:46:52,687
- 广告 - 不
- Advertising. - No.

844
00:46:54,826 --> 00:46:57,258
- 我们有4000个成员 - 因为Facebook很酷
- We've got 4000 members. - 'Cause theFacebook is cool.

845
00:46:57,258 --> 00:47:00,119
要是我们开始弹百事的小广告 那就不酷了
And if we start selling pop-ups for Mountain Dew it's not gonna be cool.

846
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:01,997
我倒是没有想到百事广告 不过…
Well I wasn't thinking it would be Mountain Dew but at some point,

847
00:47:01,997 --> 00:47:04,506
既然是我要处理生意上的业务 那网站…
And I'm talkin' as the business end of the company, the site...

848
00:47:04,506 --> 00:47:08,045
我们都不知道这到底什么 我们不知道现在是什么
We don't even know what it is yet, we don't what it is...

849
00:47:08,175 --> 00:47:08,994
也不知道它会变成什么
We don't know what it can be.

850
00:47:08,994 --> 00:47:11,438
也不知道未来它会是什么 我们只知道它很酷
We don't know what it will be. We know that it's cool,

851
00:47:12,657 --> 00:47:14,385
这就是一个无价之宝 我不能放弃这点
That's a priceless asset and I'm not giving it up.

852
00:47:14,385 --> 00:47:16,598
- 所以说不会玩完咯 - 不会玩完
- So it won't be finish? - It won't be finish.

853
00:47:16,598 --> 00:47:18,375
这就是关键 时尚的东西永远不会玩完
That's the point, the way fashion never finish

854
00:47:18,375 --> 00:47:20,394
- 什么 - 时尚 时尚永远不会玩完
- What? - Fashion, fashion is never finish.

855
00:47:20,394 --> 00:47:22,261
你在讨论时尚 真的吗 这是你吗
You talkin' about fashion, really you?

856
00:47:22,261 --> 00:47:24,832
我在说那个想法 我在说它不会玩完
I'm talkin' about the idea I'm sayin' that never finish

857
00:47:24,832 --> 00:47:28,700
好吧 但他们至少用时尚赚钱了 卖卖裤子什么的
Ok, but they manage to make money, sellin' pants

858
00:47:29,738 --> 00:47:31,160
马克 这是什么
Mark what is this?

859
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,680
- 什么什么 - 这个
- What? - this.

860
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:35,052
这叫最后通牒 她们叫什么来着
It's called the cease and desist letter. What were their names?

861
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:36,037
- 谁 - 刚刚的姑娘们
- Who? - The girls.

862
00:47:36,037 --> 00:47:37,182
你什么时候收到的
When did you get this?

863
00:47:37,182 --> 00:47:39,563
大概10天前 就在我们发布网站之后
About ten days ago. Right after we launched the site

864
00:47:39,563 --> 00:47:40,580
我的天
***

865
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:41,841
嘿 那俩姑娘 她们叫什么来着
Hey, the girls what were their names?

866
00:47:41,841 --> 00:47:44,836
上面写…温克艾沃斯兄弟说你偷了他们的创意
They're sayin'... the Winklevoss twins are sayin' that you stole their idea.

867
00:47:44,836 --> 00:47:47,164
我觉得这有点小烦人
I find that to be mildly annoying.

868
00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:49,850
他们觉得这是窃取知识产权
They find it to be Intelectual Property Theft.

869
00:47:50,647 --> 00:47:52,116
- 你瞧… - 你为什么没那给我看？
- Look... - Why don't you show it to me?

870
00:47:52,116 --> 00:47:53,617
收信人写的是我
It was addressed to me

871
00:47:53,617 --> 00:47:56,837
上面说我们的Facebook是窃取了迪维亚?纳兰德拉和温克艾沃斯兄弟的创意
They're sayin' that we stole theFacebook from Divya Narendra and the Winklevoss...

872
00:47:56,837 --> 00:47:58,045
- 我知道上面写了什么 - 真的吗
- I know what it says. - Did we?

873
00:47:58,981 --> 00:48:01,100
- 什么真的 - 现在别和我打岔
- Did we what? - Don't screw around with me now.

874
00:48:01,133 --> 00:48:02,204
看着我
Look at me

875
00:48:02,204 --> 00:48:03,930
这封信表示我们可能会面临起诉
The letter says we could face legal action.

876
00:48:03,930 --> 00:48:07,094
- 不 它表示我可能会面临起诉 - 这封信是律师发来的 马克
- No, it says I could face legal action - This is from lawyer, Mark.

877
00:48:07,094 --> 00:48:08,312
他们一定是有什么原因才会…
They must feel they have some grounds for...

878
00:48:08,312 --> 00:48:10,423
那律师是他们爸爸的法律顾问
The lawyer is their father's house counsel.

879
00:48:10,423 --> 00:48:11,281
他们有什么原因吗
Do they have grounds?

880
00:48:11,281 --> 00:48:14,259
原因就是我们的东西很酷很流行 而哈佛关系网很烂很俗套
The grounds are our thing is cool and popular and HarvardConnection is lame.

881
00:48:14,259 --> 00:48:17,454
瓦尔多 我没用他们的代码 我发誓 我一条都没用
Wardo, I didn't use any of their code, I promise, I didn't use anything.

882
00:48:17,454 --> 00:48:21,307
不是造了个漂亮的椅子就等于欠了所有造过椅子的人的钱
Look, a guy who builds a really nice chair doesn't owe money to everyone who's ever built a chair.

883
00:48:21,307 --> 00:48:23,468
是的 他们告诉我他们有个想法 但是我有了个更好的想法
Ok, they came to me with an idea. I had a better one.

884
00:48:23,468 --> 00:48:24,429
你为什么没给我看这封信
Why didn't you show me this letter

885
00:48:24,429 --> 00:48:25,746
我觉得没什么大不了的
I didn't think it was a big deal

886
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:35,473
要是出了什么事 要是出了随便什么事
If there's something wrong, if there's ever anything wrong,

887
00:48:35,724 --> 00:48:36,519
你都能和我说的
You can tell me.

888
00:48:36,519 --> 00:48:38,061
我想帮忙
I'm the guy that wants to help.

889
00:48:38,061 --> 00:48:38,971
这是我们俩的事业
This is our thing.

890
00:48:38,971 --> 00:48:43,325
现在 你还有什么要告诉我的
Now, is there anything that you need to tell me

891
00:48:43,325 --> 00:48:44,353
没了
No.

892
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,258
我们该怎么办
What are we doing about this?

893
00:48:49,258 --> 00:48:52,621
我去了学生法务中心找了个律师 他跟我说回一封信
I went to a 3-L at Student Legal Services and he told me to write them back.

894
00:48:52,621 --> 00:48:53,688
然后你怎么说
And what did you say?

895
00:48:53,688 --> 00:48:57,051
我们在一月份见面的时候 我就提及了网站的问题
When we met in January, I express my doubts about the site,

896
00:48:57,051 --> 00:49:00,753
还配了图表 解释了多少程序我是没有参与的
where it stood with graphic, how much programming was left that I had not anticipated...

897
00:49:00,753 --> 00:49:03,389
以及网站运作上硬体的缺失
...the lack of hardware we had to deal with the site use,

898
00:49:03,389 --> 00:49:06,583
还有在发布网站前缺少推广
the lack of promotion that we go on to successfully launch the website...

899
00:49:06,583 --> 00:49:10,554
这是你第一次提及这些顾虑 对吗
This was the first time you raised any of those concern, right?

900
00:49:10,554 --> 00:49:11,865
我之前就提到过
I'd raised concerns before.

901
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:13,827
- 瞎说 不是对我们提 - 先生们
- Bullshit Not to us - Gentlemen.

902
00:49:13,827 --> 00:49:17,655
我在说的是这封信里提到的 一月份的那次见面
I'm talkin about at the meeting in January to which this letter is referring.

903
00:49:17,655 --> 00:49:18,416
对
Yeah.

904
00:49:18,723 --> 00:49:20,235
我重新遣词造句一下
Let me re-phrase this.

905
00:49:20,992 --> 00:49:25,580
你给我的客户写了16封电邮 在前15封中你没有提到任何顾虑
You sent my client 16 e-mails. In the first 15, you did't raise any concerns

906
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:26,566
这算个问题吗
Is that a question?

907
00:49:26,566 --> 00:49:30,336
而在第16封里 你提到了关于网站性能的问题
In the 16th e-mail you raised concerns about the site functionality.

908
00:49:30,452 --> 00:49:33,106
- 你是否欺骗了他们6个礼拜 - 没有
- Were you leading them on for six weeks? - No.

909
00:49:33,106 --> 00:49:36,165
之前你为什么没有提到任何顾虑
Why didn't you raise any of these concern before?

910
00:49:36,165 --> 00:49:38,200
- 下雨了 - 抱歉？
- It's raining. - I'm sorry?

911
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,469
开始下雨了
It's just started raining.

912
00:49:39,469 --> 00:49:42,546
扎克伯格先生 您在听我说话吗
Mr. Zuckerberg, do I have your full attention?

913
00:49:43,626 --> 00:49:44,373
没
No.

914
00:49:46,008 --> 00:49:47,358
你觉得你该么
Do you think I deserve it?

915
00:49:47,822 --> 00:49:50,944
- 什么 - 你觉得你该听我说话么
- What? - Do you think I deserve your full attention?

916
00:49:51,978 --> 00:49:55,240
在质证之前我发过誓 我也不想作假证
I had to swear an oath before we began this deposition, and I don't want to perjure myself,

917
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,451
所以我有法律上的义务说不
So I have a legal obligation to say no.

918
00:49:57,451 --> 00:49:58,847
好吧 不
Okay - no.

919
00:49:59,490 --> 00:50:01,128
你觉得自己没必要听我说话
You don't think I deserve your attention.

920
00:50:01,128 --> 00:50:04,251
我觉得如果你的客户们 想坐在我的肩膀上自称为巨人
I think if your clients want to sit on my shoulders and call themselves tall,

921
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:05,438
他们未尝不可一试
They have the right to give it a try,

922
00:50:05,438 --> 00:50:08,683
但并不意味着我应该坐在这里听你们扯谎
But there's no requirement that I enjoy sitting here listening to people lie.

923
00:50:10,033 --> 00:50:12,502
我可以听一部分 最小的一部分
You have part of my attention. you have the minimum amount.

924
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:15,796
而我其他的注意力全都回到了 Facebook的办公室里
The rest of my attention is back at the offices of theFacebook,

925
00:50:15,796 --> 00:50:18,225
在那里 我的同事和我所做的事情
Where my colleagues and I are doing things that no one in this room,

926
00:50:18,225 --> 00:50:22,205
是这里所有人 特别是你的客户们在智力上无法胜任的工作
Including and especially your clients, are intellectually or creatively capable of doing.

927
00:50:23,981 --> 00:50:26,499
我是否充分地回答了你纡尊降贵的问题
Did I adequately answer your condescending question?

928
00:50:34,215 --> 00:50:38,261
现在12点45分了 是不是该吃饭去了 
I have 12:45, why don't we say that's lunch.

929
00:50:39,333 --> 00:50:40,623
两点半回来
Back at 02:30.

930
00:50:41,785 --> 00:50:43,687
她们叫什么
So what were their names?

931
00:50:45,418 --> 00:50:47,828
她们叫克里斯蒂和爱丽丝
Their names are Christy and Alice.

932
00:50:49,945 --> 00:50:53,232
她们今晚就想喝一杯
And They wanna have drinks tonight

933
00:51:19,709 --> 00:51:21,218
我才不管呢
I don't care.

934
00:51:43,371 --> 00:51:47,336
嘿 兄弟 抱歉 呃 有两个姑娘在里面整装呢
Hey man, sorry, uhmm, couple of girls refreshing up in there.

935
00:51:48,684 --> 00:51:49,822
真贴心
Sweet...

936
00:51:54,372 --> 00:51:55,562
我们真是好搭档
We have groupies.

937
00:52:04,601 --> 00:52:06,883
- 我马上回来 - 嘿 你要去哪儿
- I'll be right back - Hey, where you goin'?

938
00:52:07,412 --> 00:52:08,100
马克…
Mark...

939
00:52:12,833 --> 00:52:13,779
艾瑞卡
Erica

940
00:52:16,134 --> 00:52:16,752
嘿
Hey

941
00:52:16,752 --> 00:52:17,714
我看到你从那边来的
I saw you from over there

942
00:52:17,714 --> 00:52:20,436
- 我都不知道你经常来这家俱乐部 - 是第一次
- I don't know you came to this club a lot. - First time.

943
00:52:20,436 --> 00:52:21,338
我也是
Mine too.

944
00:52:22,076 --> 00:52:23,730
我们能单独谈谈么
Can I talk you alone for a second?

945
00:52:24,901 --> 00:52:26,375
我觉得我就留在这儿好了
I think I'm good right here

946
00:52:26,375 --> 00:52:28,920
只是…我想和你单独谈谈
I just... I'd love to talk you alone

947
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:31,323
- 我们能找个地方么 - 这儿就好了
- *** - Right here is fine

948
00:52:32,583 --> 00:52:34,201
我不知道你有没有听说 我新上线的一个网站
I don't know if you heard about this new website I launched.

949
00:52:34,201 --> 00:52:35,911
没听说
No.

950
00:52:36,181 --> 00:52:38,777
- 那Facebook呢？ - 你在网上骂我是个婊子 马克
- TheFacebook? - You called me a bitch on internet, Mark.

951
00:52:38,777 --> 00:52:40,429
所以我想和你谈谈
That's why, I wanna talk to you...

952
00:52:40,429 --> 00:52:43,108
- 在网上啊 - 如果你能够 所以我来…
- On the internet... - If you could just...That's why I came over

953
00:52:43,108 --> 00:52:45,080
把女人比作家畜吗
Comparing women to farm animals?

954
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:46,705
我最终并没有这么做
I didn't end up doing that.

955
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:48,382
但你还是写了这样的句子
It didn't stop you from writing it.

956
00:52:48,382 --> 00:52:53,521
好像你脑的想法都这么聪明 不分享倒成了罪过了
As if every thought that tumbles through your head is so clever, it would be a crime for it not to be share.

957
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:57,706
网上的东西可不是能擦掉的 马克 写了就永远摆在那儿了
The internet's not written in pencil, Mark, it's written in ink,

958
00:52:57,706 --> 00:53:00,470
而你说艾瑞卡?奥布莱特是个婊子
And you published that Erica Albright was a bitch.

959
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:05,051
然后又夸夸其谈侮辱了我的姓氏 还有我的胸围尺寸
Right before you made some ignorant crack about my family's name, my bra size...

960
00:53:05,051 --> 00:53:07,279
然后根据女人的热辣程度 来给她们排名次
And then rated women based on their hotness.

961
00:53:07,738 --> 00:53:10,364
- 艾瑞卡 出了什么事么 - 不 没事
- Erica, is there a problem? - No, there's no problem.

962
00:53:11,573 --> 00:53:15,995
你坐在阴暗的小房间里讽刺我 因为这年头就流行这么发泄怒火
You write your snide bullshit from a dark room because that's what the angry do nowadays.

963
00:53:17,029 --> 00:53:19,440
我对你挺好的 别这样折腾我
I was nice to you don't torture me for it.

964
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,100
如果我们找个地方好好谈谈…
If we could just go somewhere for a minute...

965
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:23,210
我不想得罪我的朋友
I don't want to be rude to my friends,

966
00:53:23,743 --> 00:53:26,054
- 好吧 - 好吧
- Okay. - Okay.

967
00:53:27,893 --> 00:53:30,007
祝你的游戏好运
Good luck with your video game.

968
00:53:30,383 --> 00:53:31,303
兄弟 这样很好
Dude, that's was great...

969
00:53:31,303 --> 00:53:33,732
道歉是件好事 不是么
That was right thing to do, you apologize, right?

970
00:53:37,001 --> 00:53:39,569
- 我们得扩展 - 什么 马克？
- We have to expand. - ***

971
00:53:41,993 --> 00:53:43,331
他生气了吗
Is he mad about something?

972
00:53:44,858 --> 00:53:47,135
好的 扩展到耶鲁和哥伦比亚大学
Okay, we're expanding to Yale and Columbia.

973
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:48,702
达斯丁 我想让你和我一起编写代码
Dustin, I want you to share the coding work with me.

974
00:53:48,702 --> 00:53:50,872
克里斯 你负责公关事务和业务拓展
Chris, you're gonna be in charge of publicity and outreach.

975
00:53:50,872 --> 00:53:53,432
你可以去BU学生报上登一篇文章 作为沟通的桥梁
You can start by gettin' a story in B.U student newspaper. It's the bridge.

976
00:53:53,432 --> 00:53:55,310
他们讨厌有关哈佛的报道
They hate doing stories about Harvard.

977
00:53:55,310 --> 00:53:57,402
报纸编辑里肯定有人是计算机专业的
Somebody at the newspaper will be a computer science major.

978
00:53:57,402 --> 00:54:00,131
告诉他们马克?扎克伯格愿意 给他们写十个小时的程序
Tell 'em Mark Zuckerberg will do 10 hours of free programming for them.

979
00:54:00,131 --> 00:54:02,050
- 你为什么要在BU报上登？ - 因为我想
- Why do you want a story in the B.U. newspaper... - Because I do.

980
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:05,085

Dustin's Vice President and Head of Programming and his 5% of the company will come from my end.

00:54:09,673 --> 00:54:13,653
克里斯是公关主任 他的报酬视其业务效果而定
Chris is Director of Publicity and his compensation will depend on the amount of work he ends up doing.

983
00:54:13,688 --> 00:54:15,081
- 还有问题吗 - 这些姑娘是谁
- Any questions? - Who the girls?

984
00:54:15,441 --> 00:54:17,884
抱歉 呃 她们是克里斯蒂和爱丽丝
Sorry, uhmm... they are Christy and Alice.

985
00:54:17,884 --> 00:54:20,210
- 嗨 - 嗨  你好
- Hi... - Hi. Hello.

986
00:54:21,470 --> 00:54:22,855
我们能帮上忙吗
Is there anything we can do?

987
00:54:22,855 --> 00:54:23,925
不 就这样了
No, that's it.

988
00:54:23,925 --> 00:54:25,244
耶鲁和哥伦比亚 开始吧
Yale and Columbia, let's go.

989
00:54:25,244 --> 00:54:27,373
- 还有斯坦福 - 什么
- And Stanford... - What?

990
00:54:27,373 --> 00:54:31,573
斯坦福 该让身处帕罗奥多的人 也见识下这个了
Standford. It's time for them to see this in Palo Alto.

991
00:54:37,285 --> 00:54:39,383
- 你不吃午饭 - 不了
- You don't want any lunch? - No.

992
00:54:40,269 --> 00:54:41,763
我的沙拉可以分你一点
You're welcome to some salad.

993
00:54:41,763 --> 00:54:42,897
不 谢了
No, thank you.

994
00:54:49,842 --> 00:54:51,281
这对你肯定很艰难
This must be hard.

995
00:54:52,749 --> 00:54:53,599
你是谁
Who are you?

996
00:54:53,938 --> 00:54:57,819
- 我叫玛丽琳?德尔皮 早上自我介绍过 - 我是说 你是干什么的
- I'm Marylin Delpy, I introduced myself this morning. - I mean, what do you do?

997
00:54:57,819 --> 00:55:00,181
我在事务所里工作了两年
I'm a second year associate at the firm.

998
00:55:00,245 --> 00:55:03,000
老板让我在质证的时候坐在桌子边
My boss wanted me to sit in on the deposition phase.

999
00:55:04,465 --> 00:55:05,360
你在做什么
What are you doin'?

1000
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:08,464
看看波斯尼亚的情况如何
Checking in to see how it's going in Bosnia.

1001
00:55:08,851 --> 00:55:09,741
波斯尼亚？
Bosnia?

1002
00:55:10,199 --> 00:55:12,530
他们没有公路却有Facebook？
They don't have roads but they have Facebook.

1003
00:55:18,304 --> 00:55:21,648
你一定很讨厌温克艾沃斯家的双胞胎
You must really hate the Winklevoss.

1004
00:55:21,946 --> 00:55:23,349
我谁也不讨厌
I don't hate anybody.

1005
00:55:24,408 --> 00:55:27,698
温克艾沃斯俩不是因我窃取知识产权而告我
The Winklevii aren't suing me for intellectual property theft.

1006
00:55:27,698 --> 00:55:30,134
他们告我是因为他们人生中第一次
They're suing me because for the first time in their lives,

1007
00:55:30,134 --> 00:55:33,221
事情没有按照他们想的那样发展
Things didn't work at the way they were supposed to for them.

1008
00:55:40,498 --> 00:55:42,870
- 他要拓展业务 - 什么
- He's expanding. - What?

1009
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:46,074
他要把网站拓展到耶鲁 哥大和斯坦福 明天这就会出现在校报上
He's expanding to Yale, Columbia and Stanford, it's gonna be in the Crimson tomorrow.

1010
00:55:46,093 --> 00:55:47,349
- 真的吗 - 对
- Really? - Yeah.

1011
00:55:47,349 --> 00:55:50,563
看来禁止真把他吓住了哈
Well, it's look like that Cease and desist letter really scared the shit out of him, huh?

1012
00:55:50,563 --> 00:55:53,690
我想请个律师起草一份指令性文件 强迫他关闭网站
I want to hire a lawyer to file for injunctive relief and get this website taken down now!

1013
00:55:53,768 --> 00:55:56,762
这网站存在得越久 "哈佛关系网"就越不值钱
Every minute, the site's up, Harvard Connection become less valuable.

1014

I want an injunction, I want damages, punitive relief and I want him dead.

我也一样
I want those things too!

1016
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:04,770
那为什么我们什么都不做 就因为我们是"哈佛绅士"？
Then why aren't we doing anything about it?! Because we're gentlemen of Harvard?!

1017
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:06,115
因为你没有想过那看起来像什么
Because you're not thinking about how it's gonna look.

1018
00:56:06,115 --> 00:56:07,231
像什么
How's it gonna look?

1019
00:56:07,231 --> 00:56:11,160
就像我们穿着骨胳装追着 小屁孩在高中体育馆里绕圈跑
Like my brother and I are in skeleton costumes chasing the Karate Kid around a high school gym.

1023
00:56:20,437 --> 00:56:22,021
哪来的什么哈佛法律
There's no such thing as Harvard law.

1024

你还不知道我的名字吧
You don't know my name, do you?

1039

甚至可能被退学

1135

是的 先生 宿管让我们找行政委员会 但行政委员会不睬我们
Yes Sir, and the House-master made a recommendation to the Ad Board but the Ad Board won't hear us.

1140
01:01:59,597 --> 01:02:01,240
你们有没有直接和那个学生谈过
Have you tried dealing with the other student directly?

1141
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:05,252
扎克伯格先生过去两周都没有回复过我们的任何邮件或电话
Mr. Zuckerberg hasn't been responding to any of our e-mails or phone calls for the last two weeks.

1142
01:02:05,252 --> 01:02:07,454
我们去敲他宿舍的门他都不应
He doesn't answer when we knock on his door at Kirkland.

1143
01:02:07,454 --> 01:02:10,490
我最近一次当面见到他还是在庭院里
And the closest I've come to dealing with him face to face is when I saw him on the quad,

1144
01:02:10,490 --> 01:02:11,884
然后我追着他跑了整个哈佛操场
And I chased him through Harvard Square.

1145
01:02:11,884 --> 01:02:12,519
你追逐他？
You chased him?

1146
01:02:12,519 --> 01:02:15,790
我看见他了 而且我知道他也看见我了 然后过了几分钟他就消失了
I- I saw him and I know he saw me and after a minutes he disappeared.

1147
01:02:16,090 --> 01:02:18,142
我不觉得这是学校的事
I don't see this as the university issue.

1148
01:02:18,142 --> 01:02:19,978
这显然是学校的事
Of course this is a university issue.

1149
01:02:19,978 --> 01:02:21,882
学校有关于道德和荣誉的准则 而他将两者都打破了
There's a code of ethics and an honor code and he violated them both.

1150
01:02:21,882 --> 01:02:26,049
你们和学校之间有道德契约 但彼此间没有
You entered into a code of ethics with the university, not with each other.

1151
01:02:26,285 --> 01:02:29,973
很抱歉Summers校长 你说的完全没道理
I'm sorry President Summers, but what you just said makes no sense to me at all.

1152
01:02:29,973 --> 01:02:31,093
我很震惊
I'm devastated by that.

1153
01:02:31,093 --> 01:02:33,787
我弟弟是想说 如果马克?扎克伯格闯进了我们宿舍
What my brother means is if Mark Zuckerberg breaking into our dorm room

1154
01:02:33,787 --> 01:02:36,224
偷走了我们的电脑 那就是学校的事了
And stole our computer, that would be university issue.

1155
01:02:36,224 --> 01:02:38,476
我不知道校长办公室还要管小偷窃
I don't know this office doesn't handle petty larceny.

1156
01:02:38,476 --> 01:02:42,136
这不是小偷窃 这是价值百万美金的创意
This isn't petty larceny. This idea potentially worth millions of dollars.

1157
01:02:42,154 --> 01:02:43,214
- 百万美金 - 对
- Millions? - Yes.

1158
01:02:43,214 --> 01:02:45,617
你们想象力太丰富了
You might just be letting your imaginations run away with you.

1159
01:02:45,617 --> 01:02:48,855
先生 我不觉得你有资格这样说
Sir, I actually don't think you're in any position to make that call.

1160
01:02:48,855 --> 01:02:52,916
我是美国财政秘书 我有资格这样说
I was the U.S. Treasury Secretary, I'm in some position to make that call

1161
01:02:52,916 --> 01:02:57,094
让我们充分发挥想象力正是你在新生入学典礼演讲时说的啊
Letting our imaginations run away with us is exactly what we were told us to do in your freshmen address.

1162
01:02:57,094 --> 01:03:01,342
我建议你们在想新项目时发挥想象力
I would suggest that you let your imaginations run away with you on a new project.

1163
01:03:01,342 --> 01:03:04,264
- 是吗 - 当然 哈佛里每个人都在发明新东西
- You would? - Yes, everyone at Harvard is eventing something.

1164
01:03:04,264 --> 01:03:08,886
哈佛的本科生相信创造工作比找工作更好
Harvard Undergraduates believe that inventing a job is better than finding a job.

1165
01:03:08,886 --> 01:03:12,689
所以我再次建议你们俩想个新项目
So I suggest again that the two of you come up with a new, new project.

1166
01:03:12,689 --> 01:03:14,132
不好意思 但那不是重点 先生
I'm sorry, but that's not the point, Sir.

1167
01:03:14,132 --> 01:03:15,817
那重点是什么
Please what's the point.

1168
01:03:15,817 --> 01:03:19,453
要辨别是非不需要是这方面的专家
You don't have to be an intellectual property expert to understand the difference between right and wrong.

1169
01:03:19,453 --> 01:03:20,754
你是说我不能辨别是非
And you're saying that I don't.

1170
01:03:20,754 --> 01:03:22,291
我绝无此意
Of course I'm not saying that.

1171
01:03:22,291 --> 01:03:23,377
我正有此意
I'm saying that.

1172
01:03:23,377 --> 01:03:24,854
- 是吗 - 先生
- Really? - Sir...

1173
01:03:24,854 --> 01:03:27,013
安 他们怎么得到预约的
Ann... How do they get this appointment?

1174
01:03:27,013 --> 01:03:28,566
他们父亲的同事
Colleagues of their father...

1175
01:03:30,633 --> 01:03:35,071
我来说清楚 两位温克艾沃斯先生 既然你们要讨论是非
Let me tell you something Mr. Winklevoss, Mr. Winklevoss, since you under subject of right and wrong.

1176
01:03:35,539 --> 01:03:39,918
你们这种行为 到这里来见我就是错的
This action, this meeting, the two of you being here is wrong.

1177
01:03:39,918 --> 01:03:43,288
这不是哈佛学生该做的事 也不是哈佛的精神
Is not worthy of Harvard, Is not what Harvard saw in you...

1178
01:03:43,288 --> 01:03:45,816
没有特殊对待
You don't get special treatment!

1179
01:03:45,816 --> 01:03:46,632
我们没有要求特殊对待
We never ask for it...

1180
01:03:46,632 --> 01:03:50,445
只是想新项目吗 就像科研课上做模型一样？
Just start another project? Like we're making a diorama for the science fair?

1181
01:03:50,445 --> 01:03:53,514
- 如果你有什么问题 温克艾沃斯先生 - 我们从没要求特殊对待
- If you have problems with that Mr. Winklevoss - We never ask for special treatment.

1182
01:03:53,514 --> 01:03:55,300
法庭随时向你们敞开
The court are always at your disposal...

1183
01:03:55,874 --> 01:03:57,229
还有什么我能帮到你们的吗
Is there anything else, I could do for you?

1184
01:03:57,230 --> 01:03:59,726
- !@#$%^&… - 闭嘴
- *** - *****

1185
01:04:00,483 --> 01:04:01,918
感谢您抽出宝贵的时间 先生
Thank you very much for your time, Sir.

1186
01:04:07,967 --> 01:04:11,277
哎呀 弄坏了你们335年历史的门把手
Ups, broke 335 years old your door knob.

1187
01:04:13,547 --> 01:04:16,517
爱德华多 春假期间 你和扎克伯格先生去了趟纽约
Eduardo, spring break, you and Mr. Zuckerberg took a trip to New York.

1188
01:04:16,517 --> 01:04:18,662
- 对 - 此行的目的是什么
- yes. - What was the purpose of the trip?

1189
01:04:19,254 --> 01:04:23,777
作为财务总监 我要去和潜在广告商洽谈
Well, as CFO, I'd set up some meetings with potential advertisers.

1190
01:04:23,836 --> 01:04:24,779
你们去是谁出的钱
Who paid for the trip?

1191
01:04:24,779 --> 01:04:27,918
来自我几个月前存的一千美金
It was paid for out of the thousand dollar account I'd set up a few months earlier.

1192
01:04:27,918 --> 01:04:32,027
在那时你的一千美金是公司唯一资金
At this point your thousand dollars was the only money that had been put into the company.

1193
01:04:32,027 --> 01:04:34,149
- 对 - 洽谈进行得如何
- Yes. - How did you feel the meetings went?

1194
01:04:35,419 --> 01:04:37,208
- 很糟糕 - 为什么
- It went terribly. - Why?

1195
01:04:37,618 --> 01:04:40,245
- 马克睡着了 - 我没睡着
- Mark was asleep. - I was not asleep.

1196
01:04:40,587 --> 01:04:41,859
我能重新说一遍吗
Can I re-phrase my answer?

1197
01:04:41,859 --> 01:04:44,193
我倒是希望他睡了
I wish he'd been asleep.

1198
01:04:46,864 --> 01:04:50,784
我们现在覆盖29个学校 有75000多个会员
So we're at 29 schools now with over 75.000 members.

1199
01:04:51,209 --> 01:04:54,863
人们上the Facebook的时间比其他网站都长
People who go on theFacebook tend to stay on longer than almost any other website.

1200
01:04:54,863 --> 01:04:59,734
最惊人的数据是 61%初始用户都会成为回头客
Now here's the most impressive statistic, 61% of people who try it once, will come back...

1201
01:04:59,734 --> 01:05:01,752
- 如果你能让我… - 抱歉 等一下
- Now if you'll allow me... - Excuse me, one second...

1202
01:05:01,752 --> 01:05:04,556
他发出的是什么声音 是"切"吗
What sound that he's making? Is that like a tsk...

1203
01:05:07,095 --> 01:05:10,775
不是"切" 是…
It wasn't tsk...

1204
01:05:11,138 --> 01:05:12,801
像火鸡叫
Like a glottal stop.

1205
01:05:13,427 --> 01:05:15,474
喉咙塞住了似的
Almost a gag reflex.

1206
01:05:16,956 --> 01:05:18,269
你们这是什么意思
Guys, what is this?

1207
01:05:18,911 --> 01:05:21,355
纽约之行还有一次会面
There was one more meeting scheduled for the New York trip.

1208
01:05:21,355 --> 01:05:22,727
对 是顿晚餐
Yes, it was a dinner.

1209
01:05:22,727 --> 01:05:24,469
那时是我女朋友安排的
It was set up through my girlfriend at the time.

1210
01:05:24,469 --> 01:05:27,113
你觉得马克对这次会面很期待吗
Would you say that Mark was excited about this meeting?

1211
01:05:27,698 --> 01:05:30,225
是的 十分期待
Yes, very.

1212
01:05:30,225 --> 01:05:32,168
- 他们不会把我们丢出去的 - 说不定呢
- Look, they're not gonna card us... - They might.

1213
01:05:32,168 --> 01:05:33,920
- 看看四周 - 这很尴尬
- I mean look around. - It'll be embarrassing.

1214
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:35,807
告诉他我们不会被丢出去
Tell him they're not gonna card us.

1215
01:05:35,998 --> 01:05:37,384
- 他们不会丢我们出去 - 马克
- They're not gonna card us. - Mark...

1216
01:05:37,384 --> 01:05:39,111
你又想说广告的事吗
Are you gonna talk about ads again?

1217
01:05:39,111 --> 01:05:42,797
除非是想做哈特福德芭蕾剧场 不然做生意就是要盈利的
Unless you're the Ballet Theatre of Hartford, the purpose of a business is to make a profit.

1218
01:05:42,797 --> 01:05:44,107
这还不是生意
This isn't a business, yet.

1219
01:05:44,107 --> 01:05:48,452
那我怎么办 我的工作就是…算了
That's tough for me because my job... Nevermind.

1220
01:05:50,977 --> 01:05:52,472
他晚了25分钟
He's 25 mins late.

1221
01:05:52,472 --> 01:05:55,061
他19岁就创办了Napster 他可以放人鸽子
He founded Napster when he was 19, he can be late.

1222
01:05:55,061 --> 01:05:56,920
- 他又不是神 - 那他是什么
- He's not a God. - Then what is he?

1223
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:58,638
他是迟到25分钟的人
He's 25 minutes late.

1224
01:05:58,638 --> 01:05:59,708
我觉得瓦尔多嫉妒了
I think Wardo's jealous.

1225
01:05:59,708 --> 01:06:03,272
我绝对不是在嫉妒 我是紧张
I honestly wasn't jealous. I was nervous.

1226
01:06:03,471 --> 01:06:04,324
为什么
Why?

1227
01:06:04,324 --> 01:06:07,911
我完全不认识他 但我据我的了解
I didn't know him at all but I had done a search and asked around...

1228
01:06:07,911 --> 01:06:14,708
他给我的印象是个很麻烦的人
He struck me as kind of a wild card.

1229
01:06:14,919 --> 01:06:15,565
为什么
Why?

1230
01:06:15,565 --> 01:06:19,276
他整垮了两家很牛的互联网公司
He crashed out of two pretty big internet companies in spectacular fashion,

1231
01:06:19,276 --> 01:06:22,069
- 他还是个瘾君子 - 但那些公司也是他创办的
- He's had a reputation with drugs. - He also founded the companies.

1232
01:06:22,069 --> 01:06:23,871
我们不需要他
We don't need him.

1233
01:06:24,868 --> 01:06:25,605
他来了
He's here.

1234
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:30,084
不不 没事 吃你们的
No, no, take your time.

1235
01:06:30,084 --> 01:06:31,945
他戴表了
And he does own a watch.

1236
01:06:31,945 --> 01:06:33,014
别说了
Stop it.

1237
01:06:34,566 --> 01:06:35,893
- 我是肖恩?帕克 - 你好
- I'm Sean Parker. - How do you do.

1238
01:06:35,893 --> 01:06:39,356
你们一定是爱德华多 克里斯蒂和马克 见到你们真高兴
You must be Eduardo and Christy and Mark, great to meet you.

1239
01:06:39,356 --> 01:06:40,541
见到你很高兴
Great to meet you.

1240
01:06:41,099 --> 01:06:42,900
你们还没点东西吃呢
You guys don't have anything in front of you.

1241
01:06:43,154 --> 01:06:44,775
- 托里 - 我们一直在等…
- Tori... - We were waiting...

1242
01:06:44,775 --> 01:06:46,976
- 行了 - 你能不能给我们来点
- Hey baby boy. - Could you bring out some things?

1243
01:06:46,976 --> 01:06:51,972
带姜汁的猪肉 金枪鱼 还有龙虾之类的开胃菜
The lacquered pork with that ginger confit, tuna tartar, and the lobster claws, that'll get us started.

1244
01:06:51,972 --> 01:06:54,425
克里斯蒂 想喝点什么
Christy what do you like to drink?

1245
01:06:55,569 --> 01:06:56,736
苹果马蒂尼
An appletini

1246
01:06:56,736 --> 01:06:58,962
不错 来四杯吧
Great. Four of those.

1247
01:06:59,704 --> 01:07:01,998
那之后就是他的个人秀了
From that point on it was a Sean-a-thon.

1248
01:07:11,075 --> 01:07:13,694
问题在于你们谈了什么
The question was what did you talk about?

1249
01:07:25,492 --> 01:07:27,445
他滔滔不绝地说Napster
He took us through his episode with Napster.

1250
01:07:27,445 --> 01:07:30,641
我不想把我的二十岁年华浪费在辩护上
I didn't want to spend my twenty as a professional defendant

1251
01:07:30,641 --> 01:07:33,402
谁知道音乐行业没点幽默感
Who knew the music industry doesn't have a sense of humor.

1252
01:07:33,964 --> 01:07:37,256
我们打算卖掉公司来偿还 欠他们所谓的三千五百万版税
We tried to sell the company to pay the 35 millions they said we owed in royalties,

1253
01:07:37,256 --> 01:07:42,427
不过我想对他们来说 这有点像用偷来的卡付偷来的汽油的钱
But I guess to them that was a little like selling a stolen card to pay for the stolen gas.

1254
01:07:42,451 --> 01:07:44,899
所以我们就说 去你妈的 然后就宣布了破产
So we said, screw it, we declare bankruptcy.

1255
01:07:44,899 --> 01:07:47,714
- 你一举成名了 - 而你的饮料喝完了
- You made a name for yourself. - And you are dry.

1256
01:07:47,714 --> 01:07:49,200
- 托里 - 不 不用了
- Tory... - No, no, I'm good.

1257
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:53,515
然后他又开始讲他第二次冒险 网络通讯录
And then he went to his second business venture which was an online rolodex.

1258
01:07:53,515 --> 01:07:55,775
他被"追逐平等"网站给踢出来了
which was an online Rolodex that he got thrown out of by Case Equity.

1259
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:59,732
这次我想 要好好干 我系了领带 把皮鞋擦得亮
And I want to do it nice this time, I put on a tie, i shine my shoes.

1260
01:07:59,732 --> 01:08:01,717
但没人愿意接小孩子的订单
But nobody want to take orders from a kid.

1261
01:08:01,717 --> 01:08:04,849
让我告诉你们接下来发生了什么
So let me tell you what happen...

1262
01:08:04,849 --> 01:08:07,934
- 我不是精神科医生 但是… - 我知道你不是
- I'm not psychiatrist, but - I'm glad with got that on record.

1263
01:08:07,934 --> 01:08:09,935
你不是精神科医生 然后呢
You're not a psychiatrist, but what...

1264
01:08:09,935 --> 01:08:12,980
精神科医生会说他得了妄想症
A psychiatrist would say that he was paranoid.

1265
01:08:12,980 --> 01:08:15,750
他们请了私人侦探 日夜跟踪我
They hire private detectives, who follow you day and night.

1266
01:08:15,750 --> 01:08:18,280
你是专业侦探的目标
You are target for hi press-escort.

1267
01:08:18,412 --> 01:08:20,241
我没有证据 但我知道他们窃听了我的电话
I can't prove it but I know they tap my phone.

1268
01:08:20,241 --> 01:08:22,944
只要能找到任何整垮我的证据
Whatever it is that's gonna trip you up, you're done already.

1269
01:08:22,944 --> 01:08:25,480
随着时间推移 做事要越来越小心
Private behaviour is really cover time gone by...

1270
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:28,784
然后不知怎么的 你就过上了达赖喇嘛一样的生活
And then somehow and someway you've manage to live your life like a Dalai lama

1271
01:08:28,784 --> 01:08:29,771
别搞错了
Don't mixed it up.

1272
01:08:29,771 --> 01:08:32,740
他们想要的不是你 是你的创意
Because they don't want you, they want your idea.

1273
01:08:32,740 --> 01:08:34,911
而且他们想让你说谢谢
And they want you to say thank you while you,

1274
01:08:34,933 --> 01:08:37,437
就是…在被他们扇了一耳光之后
Excuse me... wipe your chin and walk away.

1275
01:08:37,437 --> 01:08:38,679
这是发生在你身上的事？
That's what happen to you?

1276
01:08:38,679 --> 01:08:40,416
绝对的妄想
And delusional.

1277
01:08:40,795 --> 01:08:41,749
对
Yes,

1278
01:08:41,749 --> 01:08:43,303
但 他们总有一天要还的
But... they'll be pay back.

1279
01:08:43,303 --> 01:08:47,290
我曾经用Napster打垮唱片公司 这次也是一样
In case I brought down the record company with Napster and I left the company since then too.

1280
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:50,889
抱歉 你没有整垮唱片公司 是他们赢了
Sorry, you didn't bring down the record companies. They won.

1281
01:08:50,889 --> 01:08:52,621
- 在法庭上 - 对
- In court. - Yeah.

1282
01:08:53,114 --> 01:08:55,442
你现在还想买唱片吗 爱德华多
You wanna buy a Tower record, Eduardo?

1283
01:08:58,461 --> 01:09:02,017
然后他不停地说他在硅谷的生活
And he told story after story about life in Silicon Valley,

1284
01:09:02,017 --> 01:09:05,836
斯坦福的派对 还有在洛杉矶的百万富翁朋友
Parties at Stanford and down in LA, friends who'd become millionaires,

1285
01:09:05,836 --> 01:09:11,234
不过主要是为什么马克一定要… 一定要去加州
But mostly how Mark had to, he had to come to California.

1286
01:09:11,234 --> 01:09:13,844
然后他终于说到the Facebook
And then he cut around to theFacebook.

1287
01:09:13,844 --> 01:09:16,230
跟我说说你们的进展吧
So tell me about your progress.

1288
01:09:16,230 --> 01:09:20,618
我们覆盖了29所大学 已经有75000多个会员
Well, we're in 29 schools now, we got over 75 thousands members...

1289
01:09:20,618 --> 01:09:21,619
说说你们的战略
Tell me about the strategy.

1290
01:09:21,619 --> 01:09:26,040
好吧 比如 我们想入驻德州的贝勒大学 但贝勒大学已经有了一个校园社交网络
Ok, for instance, we wanted Baylor in Texas but Baylor already had a social network on campus

1291
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:29,985
所以我们并不直接去找他们 而是列出了他们周围所有学校
So instead of going right after them, we made a list of every school within a hundred miles

1292
01:09:29,985 --> 01:09:31,445
然后先让the Facebook入驻这些校园
And put theFacebook on those campuses first.

1293
01:09:31,445 --> 01:09:33,337
不久之后所有贝勒大学的学生就会在我们的网站上找到他们的朋友
Pretty soon all the Baylor kids were seeing their friends on our site.

1294
01:09:33,337 --> 01:09:34,699
- 我们就成功入驻了 - 小饵钓大鱼
- We were in. - Its called a little bait for a big one.

1295
01:09:34,699 --> 01:09:36,194
- 很聪明啊 马克 - 谢谢 那是我的主意
- That's smart, Mark. - Thanks that's was mine.

1296
01:09:36,194 --> 01:09:36,833
放松点
Easy.

1297
01:09:36,833 --> 01:09:38,485
不如你来说说看
Hey you know what, settle an argument for us,

1298
01:09:38,485 --> 01:09:40,938
我觉得the Facebook是时候开始盈利了
I say it's time to start making money from theFacebook

1299
01:09:40,938 --> 01:09:43,310
但马克不想要广告 你觉得谁对
But Mark doesn't want advertising. Who's right?

1300
01:09:44,770 --> 01:09:46,113
你们都不对
Neither of you yet.

1301
01:09:46,113 --> 01:09:47,450
the Facebook很酷
TheFacebook is cool,

1302
01:09:47,450 --> 01:09:49,010
- 这应该长久保持 - 对
- That's what it's got going for it. - Yeah.

1303
01:09:49,010 --> 01:09:50,271
你想用广告毁了它
You don't want to ruin it with ads

1304
01:09:50,271 --> 01:09:51,764
- 因为广告不酷 - 正是
- Because ads aren't cool. - Exactly.

1305
01:09:51,764 --> 01:09:53,712
这就像你们在校园里搞一场盛大的派对
It's like you're throwing the greatest party on campus.

1306
01:09:53,712 --> 01:09:55,654
但有人说 十一点必须结束
And someone's saying, it's gotta be over by 11:00.

1307
01:09:55,654 --> 01:09:56,604
正是如此
That's exactly right.

1308
01:09:56,604 --> 01:09:58,490
你们还不知道这到底是什么呢
You don't even know what the thing is yet.

1309
01:09:58,490 --> 01:10:00,542
能做多大 能走多远
How big it can get and how far it can go.

1310
01:10:00,542 --> 01:10:02,726
这还不该是停手的时候
This is no time to take your chips down.

1311
01:10:02,726 --> 01:10:04,613
一百万美元不够酷 你们知道什么才叫酷吗
A million dollars isn't cool. You know what's cool?

1312
01:10:04,613 --> 01:10:05,514
你？
You?

1313
01:10:08,257 --> 01:10:10,726
十亿美元
A billion dollars.

1314
01:10:13,461 --> 01:10:15,137
然后大家就都安静了
And that shut everybody up.

1315
01:10:15,137 --> 01:10:18,543
这才是你们的目标 十亿美金的价值
And that's where you're headed. A billion dollar valuation.

1316
01:10:19,405 --> 01:10:24,064
除非你们听了坏建议 虽然那样你们仍能做成功的连锁酸奶店
Unless you take bad advice in which case you might as well come up with a chain of very successful yogurt shop.

1317
01:10:24,068 --> 01:10:27,879
去钓鱼时 你可以钓很多小鱼 也可以只钓一只大鱼
When you go fishing you can catch a lot of fish or you can catch a big fish.

1318
01:10:27,930 --> 01:10:31,043
你会走进一个人房间里 看到他和14磅鳟鱼的合影吗
You ever walk into a guy's den and see a picture of him standing next to fourteen trout?

1319
01:10:31,043 --> 01:10:32,670
不 他一定是抱着3000磅的枪鱼
No he's holding an 3000 pound marlin.

1320
01:10:32,670 --> 01:10:33,970
- 对 - 好比喻
- Yup. - That's a good announce.

1321
01:10:33,970 --> 01:10:36,956
但我们都知道枪鱼不可能有3000磅重不是吗
But we all know, that marlin won't weight 3000 pounds, right?

1322
01:10:36,956 --> 01:10:38,408
- 我见过差不多那么大的 - 我从没见过
- I've seen a big one at close - No, I haven't.

1323
01:10:38,408 --> 01:10:40,895
但那家伙要抱着像路虎那么大的鱼
But I don't think the guy holdings a marlin at size of a range rover.

1324
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:43,716
那得是多大的鱼 多壮的人啊
That would really big fish or a very strong guy.

1325
01:10:43,716 --> 01:10:45,294
你没搞清楚重点吧
You think I might be getting away from the point?

1326
01:10:45,294 --> 01:10:47,102
我不是来惹麻烦的
I don't have a dog in this fight.

1327
01:10:47,102 --> 01:10:49,296
我只是个粉丝 过来打声招呼
I'm just a fan who came to say hi.

1328
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:52,039
他那晚之后就完全抓住了马克的心
He owned Mark after that dinner.

1329
01:10:52,587 --> 01:10:56,001
他告诉马克很快会再谈 拿起账单 然后就走了
He picked up the check, He told Mark they'd talk again soon and he was gone.

1330
01:10:56,001 --> 01:10:59,980
不过临走他还做了对公司的一次重大贡献
But not before he made his biggest contribution to the company.

1331
01:11:02,291 --> 01:11:05,435
把"the"去掉 只留Facebook
Drop the "the". Just Facebook.

1332
01:11:05,435 --> 01:11:06,287
更简洁
It's cleaner.

1333
01:11:09,931 --> 01:11:10,956
靠
Shit.

1334
01:11:21,033 --> 01:11:24,031
那都可以破说话速度的世界纪录了
That's gotta be some kind of land speed record for talking.

1335
01:11:24,031 --> 01:11:25,557
你想让派对在十一点结束吗
You want to end the party at eleven?

1336
01:11:27,010 --> 01:11:27,972
我要为派对付钱
I'm trying to pay for the party.

1337
01:11:27,972 --> 01:11:30,290
如果不酷的话就根本不叫派对了
There won't be a party unless it's cool.

1338
01:11:31,576 --> 01:11:32,600
你觉得呢
What'd you think?

1339
01:11:33,101 --> 01:11:34,461
是啊 好吧 把"the"去掉
Yes, sure, let's drop the "the"

1340
01:11:34,461 --> 01:11:39,199
我是说丢掉14磅鳟鱼 去抓枪鱼 这听起来不是很棒吗
I meant catching the marlin instead of the 14 trouts. Doesn't that sound good?

1341
01:11:39,199 --> 01:11:40,432
鳟鱼才这么觉得
If you're a trout.

1342
01:11:41,222 --> 01:11:42,661
我要把这些加入记录里
I'm going to enter this into the record.

1343
01:11:42,661 --> 01:11:46,631
Facebook的合并文件 以及在佛罗里达注册的有限公司
Incorporation papers for Facebook, and LLC registered in Florida,

1344
01:11:46,631 --> 01:11:48,641
- 为什么在佛罗里达注册 - 我家在那
- Why Florida? - That's where my family lives.

1345
01:11:48,641 --> 01:11:52,762
文件中对合并后股权分配说明如下
And ask the respondent to stipulate that the documents of incorporation state the ownership as follows,

1346
01:11:52,762 --> 01:11:55,031
65%归马克?扎克伯格所有
Sixty-five percent for Mark Zuckerberg,

1347
01:11:55,031 --> 01:11:58,534
30%归爱德华多?萨佛林 5%归属达斯丁?莫斯克维茨
30 percent for Eduardo Saverin and 5 percent for Dustin Moskowitz.

1348
01:11:58,534 --> 01:12:01,779
- 是做出了规定 - 是在2004年4月13日签的
- We stipulate. - And that was April 13th 2004.

1349
01:12:01,779 --> 01:12:02,733
你可以标一下
You can mark it.

1350
01:12:02,733 --> 01:12:03,849
还有什么问题吗
Do you have anything here?

1351
01:12:03,849 --> 01:12:06,828
是的 谢谢 萨佛林先生
Yes, thank you. Mr. Saverin,

1352
01:12:06,828 --> 01:12:11,817
你做过什么可以合法终止合同的事吗
Have you ever done anything that might be considered legitimate ground for termination?

1353
01:12:13,269 --> 01:12:13,944
没有
No.

1354
01:12:13,944 --> 01:12:18,441
你从没做过使公司名誉受损 或者危及公司的事吗
You never did anything to embarrass the company or even seriously jeopardize it?

1355
01:12:19,181 --> 01:12:19,924
没有
No.

1356
01:12:19,924 --> 01:12:20,867
没有？
No?

1357
01:12:24,583 --> 01:12:27,391
- 没有 - 你曾经被控虐待动物
- No. - You were accused of animal cruelty.

1358
01:12:29,141 --> 01:12:30,151
等一下
Wait.

1359
01:12:30,952 --> 01:12:33,509
- 你没有吗 - 这…这不是事实
- You weren't? - T- this not happening.

1360
01:12:33,509 --> 01:12:35,775
我这有篇校报的报道
I have here an article from The Crimson...

1361
01:12:35,775 --> 01:12:37,904
上帝啊
Jesus Christ...

1362
01:12:37,904 --> 01:12:38,898
我完全不能接受 瓦尔多
I can't have this, Wardo.

1363
01:12:38,898 --> 01:12:42,676
拜托 这是狗屎 这只是社团的恶作剧
Come on, man this is bullshit, this is another clubs playing a prank.

1364
01:12:43,736 --> 01:12:48,165
我即将加入凤凰社 而作为加入的考验
I'd gotten into the Phoenix. I'd been accepted and as part of my initiation,

1365
01:12:48,165 --> 01:12:52,528
我必须一整个星期随身携带并照顾一只鸡
I had to, for one week, carry with me all the times and take care of a chicken.

1366
01:12:52,528 --> 01:12:56,949
他们将你作为the Facebook创始人之一 "小爱德华多?萨佛林"
They identify you as one of the founders of theFacebook, "Junior Eduardo Saverin,"

1367
01:12:57,074 --> 01:13:00,412
我虽然不是专家 但也知道被扯上虐待动物对我们的事业不利
I'm not the expert but being connected to torturing animals is probably bad for business.

1368
01:13:00,412 --> 01:13:05,313
我没有虐待那只鸡 我不虐鸡 你们疯了吗
I did not torture the chicken, I don't torture chickens, are you crazy?

1369
01:13:05,313 --> 01:13:07,150
不 冷静点
No, and settle down, please.

1370
01:13:07,150 --> 01:13:09,259
我这里有篇校报的报道
I have here, an article from The Crimson...

1371
01:13:09,376 --> 01:13:11,138
- 这真尖刻 - 956
- This is scathing. - Nine-hundred-fifty-six.

1372
01:13:11,138 --> 01:13:14,300
我当时和马克在宿舍食堂吃饭
I was having dinner in the Kirkland Dining Hall with Mark,

1373
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:19,263
我带着那只鸡是因为我必须时刻带着它 这就是大学生活
And I had the chicken with me because I had to have the chicken with me at all times. This was college.

1374
01:13:19,263 --> 01:13:20,723
总得有人出来澄清一下啊
Somebody gonna have to answer for this.

1375
01:13:20,723 --> 01:13:21,633
九百六十九
Nine-hundred-sixty-nine.

1376
01:13:21,633 --> 01:13:25,563
食堂用鸡做菜 而我要喂我的鸡
Dining hall was serving chicken for dinner and I had to feed my chicken.

1377
01:13:25,563 --> 01:13:30,034
所以我只好喂了点鸡肉给鸡吃
So I took... Little pieces of chicken and gave it to the chicken.

1378
01:13:30,101 --> 01:13:34,038
肯定是有人看见了 因为我接下来就被指控逼迫同类相食了
Someone must have seen me because the next thing I knew I was being accused of forced cannibalism.

1379
01:13:34,629 --> 01:13:39,435
我不知道这是不允许的 我和好多动物权益组织联系过
I didn't know you could't do that. I dealt with the various animal rights groups,

1380
01:13:39,435 --> 01:13:43,940
我也和联合院长讨论过 问题都解决了
I dealt with the Associate Dean of the College, this was all resolved.

1381
01:13:43,940 --> 01:13:45,104
九百八十八
Nine-hundred-eighty-eight.

1382
01:13:45,104 --> 01:13:47,379
肯定是坡客或福莱的人打了小报告
Someone from the Porc or the Fly must have reported it.

1383
01:13:47,379 --> 01:13:48,963
我觉得肯定是温克艾沃斯
For all I know it was the Winklevoss...

1384
01:13:48,963 --> 01:13:50,867
好吧 忘掉它吧
Alright, let's just forget about it.

1385
01:13:50,867 --> 01:13:55,513
这太可笑了 我被指控虐待动物 还不如被指控成恋尸癖呢
This is absurd, I'm being accused of animal cruelty. Better to be accused of Necrophilia.

1386
01:13:55,513 --> 01:13:57,139
确实还不如被指控恋尸癖啊
It is better to be accused of Necrophilia.

1387
01:13:57,139 --> 01:13:58,465
我得向我父亲解释这件事
I have to explain this to my father,

1388
01:13:58,465 --> 01:14:02,244
我得向所有人解释这件事 我要…你在干什么
I'm gonna explain this to everybody, I'm gonna... what is happening on that?

1389
01:14:02,244 --> 01:14:04,397
我的"战后时期及当代艺术"马上要期末考
I have my final coming up for "Postwar and Contemporary Art".

1390
01:14:04,397 --> 01:14:07,175
我还没去上过课呢 我要写关于这四幅画的论文
And I haven't been to class. I'm supposed to write about those four paintings.

1391
01:14:07,175 --> 01:14:08,295
那是个Facebook的页面吗
Is that a facebook page?

1392
01:14:08,295 --> 01:14:11,425
对 我用马甲把画传上去 然后让大家在下面评论
Yeah, I opened it under an alias. I posted the paintings and asked people to comment.

1393
01:14:11,425 --> 01:14:14,409
时不时我再上去搅和一下 保持讨论气氛
Every once in a while, I hop on and stir the pot to get a good debate going.

1394
01:14:14,409 --> 01:14:17,087
扎克伯格先生在期末考时作弊？
Mr. Zuckerberg was cheating on his final exam?

1395
01:14:17,087 --> 01:14:18,493
我不想回答那个 格雷琴
I'd rather not answer that, Gretchen.

1396
01:14:18,493 --> 01:14:19,461
为什么
Then why not?

1397
01:14:19,461 --> 01:14:23,957
我不会指控他考试作弊 因为那不是朋友干的事
Because I'm not suing him for cheating on his final exam and so that's not what friends do.

1398
01:14:23,957 --> 01:14:25,974
但你刚刚告诉我们他作弊了
Well you just told us he was cheating.

1399
01:14:29,862 --> 01:14:32,200
你告诉你的律师我虐待动物了？
You told your lawyers I was torturing animals?!

1400
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:33,719
不 他什么也没告诉我们
No, he didn't tell us about it at all.

1401
01:14:33,719 --> 01:14:36,671
我们的诉讼律师有能力找到校报文章
Our litigators are capable of finding Crimson article.

1402
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:39,133
事实上我们跟他说这件事时 他还为你辩护
In fact when we raised the subject with him he defended you.

1403
01:14:42,699 --> 01:14:45,629
993 就差一点了
Nine-ninety-three, we are so close.

1404
01:14:45,962 --> 01:14:49,550
噢 我想起来了 我们还需要点钱 瓦尔多
Oh yeah, that reminds me, We're gonna need more money, Wardo.

1405
01:14:49,550 --> 01:14:51,461
我知道 更多服务器 更多应用…
I agree. More servers, more apps...

1406
01:14:51,461 --> 01:14:54,430
我要面试两个实习生 我们要付他们报酬
I'm interviewing two interns to come to Palo Alto and we're gonna have to pay them something.

1407
01:14:54,430 --> 01:14:55,105
抱歉 你说什么
Sorry what?

1408
01:14:55,105 --> 01:14:58,226
我已经在距离斯坦福 两个街区的地方找到了出租的房子
I already found a house for rent on a street two blocks from the Stanford campus.

1409
01:14:58,226 --> 01:14:59,629
非常完美 而且还带游泳池
It is perfect and it's got a pool.

1410
01:14:59,629 --> 01:15:01,673
你什么时候决定暑假要去加州的
When did you decide to go to California for the summer?

1411
01:15:01,673 --> 01:15:02,898
你是问我什么时候确定的吗
You mean when did I actually decide?

1412
01:15:02,898 --> 01:15:05,542
"肖恩?帕克个人秀"的时候？
Somewhere in the middle of The Sean Parker Variety Hour?

1413
01:15:06,736 --> 01:15:08,781
他说得对 我们就该去加州
He was right. California's the place we've gotta be.

1414
01:15:08,781 --> 01:15:10,199
你是加德?克拉皮特吗 (下面所说的节目主角]
Is you Jed Clampett?

1415
01:15:10,199 --> 01:15:12,158
你们在巴西也能看到"豪门新人类"？ (美国电影)
You guys got The Beverly Hillbillies in Brazil...

1416
01:15:12,158 --> 01:15:14,394
是啊 在巴西也看得到 很好看
Yes, we got the show in Brazil, it was genius.

1417
01:15:14,394 --> 01:15:15,903
你到底对肖恩有什么意见
What is your problem with Sean?

1418
01:15:16,205 --> 01:15:17,590
他根本没有什么上得了台面的东西
He doesn't bring anything to the table.

1419
01:15:17,590 --> 01:15:19,852
他没钱 达斯丁编程都比他好
He doesn't have money, Dustin's a better programmer...

1420
01:15:19,852 --> 01:15:21,546
他认识风投的人
He's got connections to the VCs.

1421
01:15:21,546 --> 01:15:24,973
我们不需要风投 我们需要广告商 而且我也认识风投的人啊
We don't need VCs, we need advertisers and I've got connections to the VCs.

1422
01:15:24,973 --> 01:15:25,985
- 他有经验而且… - 听着
- The real players and... - Look

1423
01:15:25,985 --> 01:15:28,165
作为一个刚让公司颜面受损的人
As someone who's really embarrassed the company in a bad way...

1424
01:15:28,165 --> 01:15:29,533
那是温克艾沃斯俩干的好事 马克
It was the Winklevosses, Mark!

1425
01:15:29,533 --> 01:15:31,677
等一下 点刷新
Hang on. Hit refresh.

1426
01:15:32,802 --> 01:15:35,933
十五万零四
150.004

1427
01:15:35,933 --> 01:15:38,372
150000个会员 瓦尔多
150.000 members, Wardo.

1428
01:15:38,372 --> 01:15:40,224
- 恭喜你 兄弟 - 恭喜
- Congratulations, dude. - Congratulations.

1429
01:15:40,790 --> 01:15:44,745
你不觉得很奇怪吗 还被私人侦探跟踪
You don't think it was strange? That he was followed by private detectives?

1430
01:15:44,745 --> 01:15:45,979
谁人无错
Who came up with nothing.

1431
01:15:45,979 --> 01:15:48,464
但已经错到让他离开公司了 毒品 泡妞…
Enough to get him out of the company. The drugs, the girls...

1432
01:15:48,464 --> 01:15:49,649
我们又不知道那些是不是真的
We don't know any of that's true.

1433
01:15:49,649 --> 01:15:50,410
你可以去查查看
You can read about it.

1434
01:15:50,410 --> 01:15:52,771
我查得到你虐待动物
I can read about your torturing birds. Since when reading something about...

1435
01:15:52,771 --> 01:15:56,233
鱼就不吃鱼了吗？! 枪鱼和鳟鱼？
Don't fish eat other fish?! The marlins and the trout?!

1436
01:15:58,701 --> 01:15:59,394
他在说什么
What's he talkin' about?

1437
01:15:59,394 --> 01:16:01,972
我明晚十点要去实验室面试实习生
I'm interviewing interns at 10 tomorrow night in the CS lab.

1438
01:16:02,216 --> 01:16:05,865
随便你怎么样 我无语了
Get on board with this man, you know... I don't really know what else to say.

1439
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:41,958
这是在干什么
What's goin' on?

1440
01:16:41,958 --> 01:16:44,559
他们有十分钟入侵Python服务器
They have 10 mins to get root access to a Python web server,

1441
01:16:44,559 --> 01:16:47,838
破解SSL加密 在安全端口拦截所有流量
Expose its SSL encryption and then intercept all traffic over its secure port.

1442
01:16:47,838 --> 01:16:48,729
他们是在黑别人
They're hacking.

1443
01:16:48,729 --> 01:16:50,865
都是在Pix防火墙模拟器上 但这正是有趣之处
All behind a Pix Firewall Emulator. But here's the beauty.

1444
01:16:50,865 --> 01:16:52,784
你知道我完全听不懂你在说什么吧
You know I didn't understand anything you just said, right?

1445
01:16:52,784 --> 01:16:53,960
- 我知道 - 所以好玩之处在哪
- I do know that. - So what's the beauty?

1446
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:56,196
每写十行代码 就要喝一杯
Every 10th line of code written, they have to take a shot.

1447
01:16:56,196 --> 01:16:57,273
而且黑客应该隐蔽
And hacking's supposed to be stealth,

1448
01:16:57,273 --> 01:17:00,827
所以服务器每检测到一次入侵 负责的那个人也要喝一杯
So anytime the server detects an intrusion, the candidate responsible has to take a shot.

1449
01:17:00,827 --> 01:17:04,693
我还有个时不时就同时 在五台电脑上跳出窗口的程序
I also have a program running that has a pop-up window appear simultaneously on all five computers...

1450
01:17:04,693 --> 01:17:06,636
最后一个点窗口的人也得喝一杯
The last candidate to hit the window has to take a shot.

1451
01:17:06,636 --> 01:17:08,870
另外每三分钟他们也都得喝一杯
Plus every three minutes they all have to take a shot.

1452
01:17:08,870 --> 01:17:10,114
三分钟到
Three minutes.

1453
01:17:11,858 --> 01:17:15,629
我能问问实习生工作里面 有什么部分是需要喝醉的吗
Can I ask, what part of the interns jobs will they need to be able to do drunk?

1454
01:17:15,629 --> 01:17:19,182
对 更应该做的测试是 他们能不能养一个礼拜的鸡
You're right. A more relevant test would be seeing if they can keep a chicken alive for a week.

1455
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:22,444
我很刻薄
That was mean.

1456
01:17:22,444 --> 01:17:23,260
看
Here...

1457
01:17:23,866 --> 01:17:24,603
这是什么
What is this.

1458
01:17:24,603 --> 01:17:27,456
我开了个新账户 存进去18000美金
I opened a new account and put $18.000 in it.

1459
01:17:29,378 --> 01:17:30,667
那够暑假用吗
Will that get you through the summer?

1460
01:17:38,963 --> 01:17:40,093
欢迎加入Facebook
Welcome to Facebook.

1461
01:17:50,178 --> 01:17:51,912
- 18000美元 - 对
- $18.000 - Yes.

1462
01:17:51,912 --> 01:17:54,709
- 外加你已经投入的1000美元 - 对
- In addition to the $1000 you'd already put up. - Yes.

1463
01:17:54,709 --> 01:17:56,717

A total of $19.000 now.

1464
01:17:56,717 --> 01:17:58,236
- 对 - 等等
- Yes. - Hang on.

1465
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:01,784
我只是检查一下计算
I'm just checking your math on that.

1466
01:18:01,784 --> 01:18:04,861
对 我也得到了同样的结果
Yes, I got the same thing.

1467
01:18:04,970 --> 01:18:06,263
我能继续了吗
May I continue?

1468
01:18:06,571 --> 01:18:11,486
在表达了对扎克伯格先生暑假把公司搬到加州去的忧虑后
After expressing misgivings about Mr. Zuckerberg taking the company and moving it to California for the summer,

1469
01:18:11,486 --> 01:18:14,797
你为什么改变心意给他18000美元
Why did you turn around and put $18.000 in an account for his use?

1470
01:18:14,797 --> 01:18:18,208
我觉得我们是伙伴 我们是团队
I figured we were partners. I wanted to be a team player.

1471
01:18:18,442 --> 01:18:21,712
我觉得马克 达斯丁还有新的实习生
I figured Mark, Dustin and the new interns could work on the site.

1472
01:18:21,712 --> 01:18:24,232
在我去纽约寻求商机的期间 可以做好网站的工作
While I was on generating advertiser interest in New York.

1473
01:18:24,264 --> 01:18:29,036
不过我更多是觉得 就三个月能出什么事
But mostly I figured, how much could possibly go wrong in three months?

1474
01:18:30,695 --> 01:18:32,059
上上上
go.go...

1475
01:18:37,177 --> 01:18:37,830
我没死
I didn't die.

1476
01:18:37,830 --> 01:18:38,648
我知道
I know.

1477
01:18:38,648 --> 01:18:40,126
- 我做到了 - 确实
- I made it. - You did.

1478
01:18:42,005 --> 01:18:44,526
我跳了八米远
That was like an 8.

1479
01:18:44,526 --> 01:18:45,604
最多两米
That was like a 2.

1480
01:18:45,604 --> 01:18:47,835
- 不是吧 - 没错
- It was better than that. - Yeah.

1481
01:18:56,781 --> 01:18:58,394
- 我没事 - 你确定？
- I'm ok. - You sure...

1482
01:18:58,575 --> 01:18:59,280
对

1483
01:18:59,776 --> 01:19:00,782
呀
Yikes.

1484
01:19:02,334 --> 01:19:03,334
门铃响了
That's the doorbell

1485
01:19:03,785 --> 01:19:04,939
我不知道我们还有门铃
I don't know we had a door bell.

1486
01:19:04,939 --> 01:19:07,108
- 安德鲁 去开门 - 他才不会去开呢
- Andrew get the door. - No, he's wired in.

1487
01:19:07,917 --> 01:19:09,848
我们的安全押金要没了
That's gonna cut into the security deposit.

1488
01:19:11,717 --> 01:19:13,706
- 安德鲁 不错 - 现在不行
- Andrew... Not now. - Good boy

1489
01:19:18,581 --> 01:19:19,886
- 肖恩 - 马克
- Sean - Mark.

1490
01:19:19,886 --> 01:19:22,725
- 你住这儿？ - 是啊 你也是？
- Do you live here? - Yeah. Do you?

1491
01:19:22,725 --> 01:19:24,368
我们就住对门 我们看见烟囱
We were right across the street, we saw the chimney...

1492
01:19:24,368 --> 01:19:25,511
- 是的 - 有人受伤吗
- Yeah - Is anybody hurt?

1493
01:19:25,511 --> 01:19:27,646
没有 你住街对面？
No. You live across the street.

1494
01:19:28,832 --> 01:19:30,074
我叫莎伦
I'm Sharon.

1495

这是我的…莎伦 她也住街对面 我正要帮她搬家 然后就看到烟囱
This is my... Sharon. She lives across the street and I was helping her move out when we saw the chimney...

1496
01:19:34,003 --> 01:19:36,045
对 我们做了个滑索通往泳池

01:35:29,867 --> 01:35:32,452
你是让我相信Facebook的财务总监
You're asking me to believe that the CFO of Facebook,

1765
01:35:32,452 --> 01:35:35,264
竟然不会改他Facebook主页上的情感状态？
Doesn't know how to change his relationship status on Facebook?

1766
01:35:35,264 --> 01:35:38,142
这很尴尬 所以你应该认为我不会拿这撒谎
It's a little embarrassing so you should take it as as sign of trust that I would tell you that.

1767
01:35:38,142 --> 01:35:39,529
- 去死吧 - 别激动
- Go to hell. - Take it easy.

1768
01:35:39,529 --> 01:35:43,858
你没改是因为那样你每次去看马克时 就可以跟那些硅谷的荡妇乱搞了
You didn't change it so you could screw those Silicon Valley slut every time you go out to see Mark.

1769
01:35:43,858 --> 01:35:45,594
这完全不是事实 我可以保证
That is not ever remotely true and I can promise you...

1770
01:35:45,594 --> 01:35:50,075
那些硅谷荡妇才不管你Facebook上的情感状态
That the Silicon Valley Slut don't care what anyone's relationship status is on Facebook.

1771
01:35:50,075 --> 01:35:53,203
- 拜托你拆礼物吧 - 你的电话还能用嘛
- Please open your present. - Your phone does work.

1772
01:35:54,670 --> 01:35:55,514
是马克
It's Mark.

1773
01:35:55,514 --> 01:35:59,768
好吧 这真棘手 拆礼物吧 是条丝巾
Okay, this is gonna be tricky. Open your present. It's a silk scarf.

1774
01:36:00,608 --> 01:36:03,770
- 你看我围过围巾吗 - 都会有第一次的
- Have you ever seen me wear a scarf? - This'll be your first.

1775
01:36:04,795 --> 01:36:06,325
- 喂 - 你冻结了我们的账户？
- yeah. - You froze our account?

1776
01:36:06,325 --> 01:36:08,003
- 没错 - 你冻结了账户
- I did. - You froze the account.

1777
01:36:08,003 --> 01:36:09,372
我要引起你的重视 马克
I had to get your attention, Mark.

1778
01:36:09,372 --> 01:36:11,189
你意识到你这是危及整个公司的吗
Do you realize that you jeopardized the entire company?

1779
01:36:11,189 --> 01:36:13,934
你意识到你的行为 可能会把我所有的努力毁于一旦吗
Do you realize that your actions could've permanently destroyed everything I've been working on?

1780
01:36:13,934 --> 01:36:14,790
是我们的努力
WE've been working on.

1781
01:36:14,790 --> 01:36:16,534
没有钱 网站就无法运作
Without money, the site can't function.

1782
01:36:16,534 --> 01:36:20,004
让我告诉你Facebook和其他网站的区别吧 那就是它永远不会崩溃
Ok let me tell you the different between Facebook and everybody else, we don't crash ever.

1783
01:36:20,004 --> 01:36:23,933
只要服务器哪怕崩溃一天 我们的名声就全毁了
If the servers are down for even a day, our entire reputation is irreversibly destroy.

1784
01:36:23,933 --> 01:36:26,020
- 听着 - 真的 Friendster的失败就证明了这一点
- Look... - Seriously, I think Friendster prove that!

1785
01:36:26,020 --> 01:36:29,007
就算是很少的人离开 也会对整个用户群造成巨大的影响
Even a few people leaving would reverberate through the entire user base.

1786
01:36:29,007 --> 01:36:31,058
用户是互相连通的 这是关键
The users are interconnected, that's the whole point!

1787
01:36:31,058 --> 01:36:33,318
大学生在线是因为他们的朋友在线
College kids are online because their friends are online.

1788
01:36:33,318 --> 01:36:35,470
这就像多米诺骨牌效应 你明白了吗
And if one domino goes, the other dominoes go!

1789
01:36:35,470 --> 01:36:38,849
我再也不想去什么 犹太兄弟会的"加勒比之夜"了
I'm not going back to the Carribean Night at A-E-Pi.

1790
01:36:40,324 --> 01:36:42,527
老天爷啊
Holy shit...!

1791
01:36:44,920 --> 01:36:47,154
- 你搞什么飞机 - 你喜欢被人无视吗
- What's wrong with you! - Did you like being nobody?!

1792
01:36:47,287 --> 01:36:49,191
你喜欢被当作笑话吗 你想回到那种生活吗
Did you like being a joke? Do you wanna go back to that?!

1793
01:36:49,191 --> 01:36:50,382
等一下 等一下
Hang on, hang on...

1794
01:36:50,382 --> 01:36:54,111
那是幼稚的行为 不是个成熟男人的作为 而且肯定不是一个朋友的作为
That was the act of a child, not a decent man. And it truly wasn't the act of a friend.

1795
01:36:54,111 --> 01:36:56,355
你知道我今天去取钱的时候有多难堪吗
You know how embarrassed I was when I tried to cash a check today?

1796
01:36:56,355 --> 01:36:58,651
我不要回到那种生活了 也许你很沮丧
I'm not going back to that life. Maybe you were frustrated.

1797
01:36:58,651 --> 01:36:59,444
对
yeah.

1798
01:37:00,093 --> 01:37:02,112
- 也许你很生气 - 我确实很生气
- Maybe you were angry, - I was.

1799
01:37:02,831 --> 01:37:07,584
不过我不介意让一切都随风而去 因为我有好消息要告诉你
But I'm willing to let bygones be bygones because I've got a good news.

1800
01:37:07,584 --> 01:37:12,156
我很抱歉 我当时很生气 可能也太幼稚了
Look, I'm sorry. I was angry and maybe it was childish.

1801
01:37:12,156 --> 01:37:13,734
但我想引起你的注意
But I had to get your attention.

1802
01:37:13,734 --> 01:37:16,877
爱德华多 我说我有好消息要告诉你
Eduardo, I said I've got some good news.

1803
01:37:17,445 --> 01:37:18,149
什么好消息
What is it?

1804
01:37:18,149 --> 01:37:20,492
彼得?提尔决定给我们五十万美金的天使投资
Peter Thiel just made an angel investment of a half million dollars.

1805
01:37:20,492 --> 01:37:23,369
- 什么 - 五十万美元
- What? - half million dollars

1806
01:37:23,710 --> 01:37:25,980
而且他会给我们办公室
And he's setting us up in an office.

1807
01:37:26,555 --> 01:37:28,149
他们要重组公司
They want to re-incorporate the company,

1808
01:37:28,149 --> 01:37:30,812
他们想见你 而且需要你签一些文件
They want to meet you and they need your signature on some documents.

1809
01:37:30,812 --> 01:37:35,029
所以快点做第一班航班到旧金山来 我需要我的财务总监
So get your ass on the first flight back to San Fransisco. I need my CFO.

1810
01:37:40,247 --> 01:37:41,093
我马上就到
I'm on my way.

1811
01:37:41,093 --> 01:37:42,520
- 瓦尔多 - 在
- Wardo. - Yeah.

1812
01:37:42,969 --> 01:37:43,795
这是我们的成果
We did it.

1813
01:37:47,562 --> 01:37:48,265
瓦尔多
Wardo,

1814
01:37:49,505 --> 01:37:51,237
你已经要回去了吗
You're going back there already?

1815
01:37:51,345 --> 01:37:52,323
对
Yes.

1816
01:37:54,534 --> 01:37:56,511
还有 我要跟你分手
And also I'm breaking up with you.

1817
01:38:04,590 --> 01:38:07,759
四份文件 头两份是股份收购协议
Four documents. These first two are common stock purchase agreements,

1818
01:38:07,759 --> 01:38:10,871
可以让你购买重组后的Facebook的股份
Allowing you to buy stock in the newly re-incorporated Facebook

1819
01:38:10,871 --> 01:38:13,883
也就是说旧的股份现在已经没有价值了
as supposed the old share which is now worthless.

1820
01:38:14,416 --> 01:38:15,678
第三份是交换协议
The third is the exchange agreement,

1821
01:38:15,678 --> 01:38:20,739
你可以用旧股份换新股份 最后一份是股东投票协议
Allowing you to exchanges the old shares for new shares and then finally voter holding agreement.

1822
01:38:20,739 --> 01:38:23,183
我会有多少股份？
How many shares of stock will I own?

1823
01:38:23,183 --> 01:38:27,556
- 1,328,334美元 - 上帝啊
- 1.328.334 - Jesus Christ.

1824
01:38:27,556 --> 01:38:30,650
大概是34.4%的股份
That's a 34,4% ownership share.

1825
01:38:30,759 --> 01:38:33,303
为什么他们在原有的30%上增加了
Why they increase from the original 30%?

1826
01:38:33,303 --> 01:38:36,006
因为你们可能会稀释原有股份 以用股份吸引新的投资者
Because you may need to dilute it to award shares to new investors.

1827
01:38:36,723 --> 01:38:38,953
- 我真喜欢跟学商的人合作 - 是啊
- I love working with business majors. -

1828
01:38:38,953 --> 01:38:40,262
- 学经济的 - 对
- Economics. - right.

1829
01:38:40,262 --> 01:38:45,759
你应该知道马克的股份已经从60%降到51%了
You should know that Mark's already taken his percentage from 60 down to 51.

1830
01:38:46,484 --> 01:38:49,344
马克不在乎钱 而且他需要保护
Well, Mark doesn't care about money and he needs to be protected.

1831
01:38:51,747 --> 01:38:57,445
达斯丁?莫斯克维茨拥有6.81% 肖恩?帕克有6.47%
Dustin Moskowitz owns 6,81%, Sean Parker 6,47%

1832
01:38:59,488 --> 01:39:02,415
可以接受 还有彼得?提尔占7%
I can live with that. And Peter Theil 7%

1833
01:39:05,925 --> 01:39:08,429
要用我的笔吗
Would you like to use my pen?

1834
01:39:09,135 --> 01:39:10,173
爱德华多？
Eduardo?

1835
01:39:11,573 --> 01:39:12,547
爱德华多？
Eduardo?

1836
01:39:13,857 --> 01:39:15,068
你能重复一遍问题吗
Can you please repeat the question?

1837
01:39:15,068 --> 01:39:17,203
不 那种尖锐的问题问一次都是可耻的
No. It was an outrageously leading question, the first time.

1838
01:39:17,203 --> 01:39:18,589
而你现在还想再听一次？
Now you want to hear it twice?

1839
01:39:18,589 --> 01:39:20,199
你能重复一遍吗
Would you re-read that please?

1840
01:39:20,882 --> 01:39:21,526
问吧
Go ahead.

1841
01:39:21,526 --> 01:39:23,502
你在签署这些文件时
And when you signed these documents,

1842
01:39:23,502 --> 01:39:26,315
有没有意识到你是在签下自己的死亡证明
Were you aware that you were signing your own death certificate?

1843
01:39:26,315 --> 01:39:27,083
没有
No.

1844
01:39:31,721 --> 01:39:36,333
当时我没有请律师来检查一遍那些文件 我真是太愚蠢了
It was insanely stupid of me not to have my own lawyer look over all the... uh,

1845
01:39:36,333 --> 01:39:39,402
说实话我当时就觉得他们是我的律师
In all honesty I thought they were my lawyers.

1846
01:39:42,565 --> 01:39:47,712
我是你唯一的朋友 你只有一个朋友
I was your only friend. You had one friend.

1847
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:53,761
- 我父亲都不再理我了 - 爱德华多
- My father won't even look at me. - Okay. Eduardo.

1848
01:39:53,761 --> 01:39:58,149
扎克伯格先生在你签文件后说了什么吗
Did Mr. Zuckerberg saying anything to you after you signed the papers?

1849
01:39:58,382 --> 01:40:01,494
当时不停握手 祝贺之类的
There was a lot of handshaking and a lot of congratulations.

1850
01:40:02,638 --> 01:40:06,457
他告诉了我 他至少有一学期不能回学校
He'd already told me he wouldn't be coming back to school for at least a semester.

1851
01:40:07,216 --> 01:40:09,477
所以我们还道了一下别
So we were saying goodbye for a while.

1852
01:40:10,811 --> 01:40:13,322
- 然后在我走之前 他说… - 但你必须回来
- And then before I left, he said... - But you gotta come back.

1853
01:40:13,322 --> 01:40:15,689
十一月末十二月初的时候
Somewhere around the end of November or early December.

1854
01:40:15,777 --> 01:40:18,371
彼得想等我们用户突破百万时 搞个盛大的庆功宴
Peter wanna throw us an amazing party when we hit a million members,

1855
01:40:18,371 --> 01:40:20,415
绝对是空前的 你一定要回来参加
It's gonna be out of control. You gotta come back for it.

1856
01:40:20,415 --> 01:40:21,599
一百万用户
A million members.

1857
01:40:21,599 --> 01:40:22,459
对
Yeah.

1858
01:40:23,427 --> 01:40:26,621
还记得宿舍窗上的运算法则吗
The algorithm on the window at Kirkland?

1859
01:40:27,547 --> 01:40:28,139
是的
Yeah.

1860
01:40:32,377 --> 01:40:33,511
是的 我会来参加的
Yeah, I'll be here.

1861
01:40:38,700 --> 01:40:40,870
- 你确定我要这么做吗？ - 你迟到了20分钟
- You sure about this? - You're 20 mins late.

1862
01:40:40,870 --> 01:40:43,672
你要进去 说你睡过头了 没时间整理着装
You're gonna walk in there and say you overslept and you didn't have time to get dressed.

1863
01:40:43,672 --> 01:40:44,376
他们会央求你的
They're gonna pitch you.

1864
01:40:44,376 --> 01:40:47,520
"追逐平等"会央求你收下他们的钱
Chase equity is going to pitch you. They're gonna beg you to take their money.

1865
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:50,672
你就点头 点头 点头 然后说
You're gonna nod, you're gonna nod, you're gonna nod and then you're gonna say,

1866
01:40:50,672 --> 01:40:52,593
"你们谁是拉尔夫"
"Which one of you is Ralph"

1867
01:40:52,593 --> 01:40:55,438
不 不是拉尔夫… 是马宁汉姆 你们谁是米切尔?马宁汉姆
No, not Ralph... No Manningham. Which one of you, Michael Manningham?

1868
01:40:55,438 --> 01:40:56,483
然后他会说 "是我"
And he'll say I am.

1869
01:40:56,483 --> 01:41:01,148
然后你就说 肖恩?帕克说"草泥马" 然后你就走出来
Then you'll say, Sean Parker says "Fuck You." Walk out.

1870
01:41:01,693 --> 01:41:02,422
好
Okay.

1871
01:41:15,991 --> 01:41:19,922
十一月下旬我收到马克的邮件 让我去参加百万用户庆功宴
In late November I got the e-mail from Mark telling me to come out for the millionth member party.

1872
01:41:19,922 --> 01:41:21,660
那封邮件还说什么了？
What else did e-mail say?

1873
01:41:21,660 --> 01:41:24,086
还说我们要开个工作会议
It said that we had to have a business meeting.

1874
01:41:24,754 --> 01:41:28,274
马克和肖恩对Chase Equity 玩了某种报复小把戏
That Mark and Sean had playing some kind of revenge stunt to Chase Equity.

1875
01:41:28,758 --> 01:41:33,478
马宁汉姆印象深刻 所以他开出了难以拒绝的条件
Manningham was so impressed that he was makin' an investment offer that was hard to turn down.

1876
01:41:34,464 --> 01:41:38,200
于是我就去了加州 直接去了新公司
I went out to California and I went straight to the New Offices.

1877
01:41:38,717 --> 01:41:44,363
我不知道该打扮成去参加派对 还是去开会 所以我就掺杂了两者
I didn't know whether to dress for the party or the business meeting so I kinda dressed for both.

1878
01:41:45,724 --> 01:41:46,733
不过这不重要
But it didn't matter.

1879
01:41:46,920 --> 01:41:47,572
为什么
Why not?

1880
01:41:47,572 --> 01:41:49,925
因为我不是因这两个原因被叫去的
Because I wasn't called out there for either one...

1881
01:41:49,925 --> 01:41:51,739
你是为什么被叫去的呢
What were you called out there for?

1882
01:41:55,324 --> 01:41:56,684
伏击
An ambush.

1883
01:41:56,912 --> 01:41:58,599
萨佛林先生 你好
Mr. Saverin. Hi...

1884
01:41:58,599 --> 01:41:59,699
过来这边
Hey. Right over here.

1885
01:42:11,215 --> 01:42:15,049
起初我以为他是开玩笑 要给我签更多的合同
At first I thought he was joking, giving me more contracts to sign.

1886
01:42:19,070 --> 01:42:20,813
但之后我开始看条款
But then I started reading.

1887

And you made a bad business deal with your own company?!

1914
01:43:45,940 --> 01:43:47,532

It's gonna be like I'm not part of Facebook.

是你干的 我就知道是你干的 那只鸡是你设计我害我的
You... you did it. I knew you did it. You planted the story about the chicken.

1927
01:44:18,067 --> 01:44:19,669
我没有用鸡来设计害你
I didn't planted the story about the chicken.

1928
01:44:19,669 --> 01:44:21,605
- 他在说什么 - 你指控我虐待动物

1929
01:44:21,605 --> 01:44:23,040
真的 这鸡是怎么回事
Seriously, what the hell with the chicken?

1930
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:25,417
我相信你最痛恨的
And I'll bet what you hated the most,

1931
01:44:25,417 --> 01:44:28,928
就是他们还把我写成Facebook的创始人之一
They said they identified me as a co-founder of Facebook.

1932
01:44:28,928 --> 01:44:31,730
而我正是 你最好快点请律师 浑蛋
Which I am! You better lawyer-up, asshole,

1933
01:44:31,730 --> 01:44:37,637
因为我不会为了30%回来 我要拿走我应得的一切
'Cause I'm not comin' back for 30% I'm comin' back for everything!

1934
01:44:43,025 --> 01:44:45,045
- 把他带出去 - 没事 我自己走
- Get him outta here. - It's okay. I'm going.

1935
01:44:47,911 --> 01:44:48,624

I wouldn't cash it though. I drew it on the account you froze.

1939

我很喜欢站在你旁边 肖恩

We're gonna walk down to the club like it's the Macy's Parade.

1944
01:45:31,670 --> 01:45:35,005
玛奇 放大屏幕 我们马上就要破百万了
Mackey, put it up on the big screen, we've gotta almost be there.

你有点过分了
You were kinda rough on him.

1948
01:45:44,973 --> 01:45:47,276
- 你知道你可以不用那么过分的 - 听着 马克 我只是…
- No. You didn't have to be that rough on him.

1949
01:45:47,276 --> 01:45:48,253
肖恩
Sean...

1950
01:45:50,113 --> 01:45:53,318
- 你可以不用那么过分的 - 他差点毁了公司
- You didn't have to be that rough on him. - He almost killed it!

Speaking of flowers, I'm putting together a party after the party at Kappa Eta Sigma.

1960
01:46:16,188 --> 01:46:17,398
打扰一下 马克
Excuse me, Mark.

1961
01:46:17,923 --> 01:46:19,496
我们正说到你呢
We were just talkin' about you,

1962
01:46:19,496 --> 01:46:21,106
你工作做得很出色

1963
01:46:21,639 --> 01:46:23,998

Put on my desk.

1966

Nothing.

1968
01:46:40,621 --> 01:46:41,367

1970
01:46:42,134 --> 01:46:43,468
刷新
Refresh!

1971
01:46:51,540 --> 01:46:54,462
我知道你不喜欢拥抱
And you need a hugger, I know.

1972
01:46:57,531 --> 01:46:59,043
一百万
1 millions, 

1973
01:47:00,854 --> 01:47:02,415
谁有香槟
who's got champagne?

1974
01:47:26,398 --> 01:47:29,862
下一步计划是做一个照片分享的应用
...A pic sharing application.

1975
01:47:29,862 --> 01:47:32,956
一个可以在社交圈里分享照片的地方
A place where you view pictures that coincide with your social life.

1976
01:47:32,956 --> 01:47:36,369
是你生活的数字化真实写照
It is the true digitalization of your life.

1977
01:47:36,369 --> 01:47:38,540
- 看到了吗 - 看看我美不美
- You can use a CD. - You can do it off of me.

1978
01:47:38,698 --> 01:47:42,264
你不需要去参加派对 你可以用相机参加派对
You don't just go to a party anymore, you go to a party with your digital camera,

1979
01:47:42,264 --> 01:47:44,423
而你的朋友就可以在网上重现派对
And then your friends re-live the party online.

1980
01:47:44,423 --> 01:47:45,974
还可以加标签 这创意…
And tagging. The idea...

1981
01:47:45,974 --> 01:47:47,895
把罩罩脱了会不会更方便
Would this be easier without the bra?

1982
01:47:47,895 --> 01:47:49,622
可以试试看
It's worth finding out.

1983
01:47:57,088 --> 01:47:58,867
关掉音乐 立刻!
Stop the music, now!

1984
01:48:03,603 --> 01:48:05,904
我花了很多时间研究人们登录后都做什么
I've spent hours... watching what people do when they log on

1985
01:48:05,904 --> 01:48:07,730
他们怎么查看好友的状态更新
They check friends status update,

1986
01:48:07,730 --> 01:48:09,357
好奇怪 音乐怎么没了
That's weird, why the music off...

1987
01:48:09,357 --> 01:48:12,385
查看那些好友修改了资料 换了照片以及…
Checked to see which of their friends had changed their profiles, changed their photos and mostly...

1988
01:48:12,385 --> 01:48:13,672
说真的 音乐怎么了
Seriously, what happen with the music

1989
01:48:13,672 --> 01:48:18,007
我们在农场生活过 后来生活在城市 而我们现在要生活在互联网络上
We lived on farms, and then we lived in cities and now we're going to live on internet

1990
01:48:18,007 --> 01:48:21,369
肖恩 打住 我觉得楼下有什么事
Sean. Stop, I think something's goin' on downstairs.

1991
01:48:31,965 --> 01:48:33,674
注意一下
Please...

1992
01:48:33,674 --> 01:48:35,116
各回各家吧
Time to go home!

1993
01:48:35,116 --> 01:48:37,028
派对结束了
Party is over.

1994
01:48:40,748 --> 01:48:42,498
- 警察 - 靠
- It's the cops! - Shit.

1995
01:48:47,656 --> 01:48:49,880
很高兴见到你 警官 有什么能帮到你们的吗
Good to see you officer... What can I do for you.

1996
01:48:51,419 --> 01:48:52,082
发生了什么事
What's goin' on?

1997
01:48:52,082 --> 01:48:54,470
是因为音乐太吵了吗 我们正在庆祝
Was the music too loud? We were havin' celebration.

1998
01:48:54,470 --> 01:48:56,139
小姐 请扣上衬衫扣子
Miss, I need you to button your blouse.

1999
01:48:56,139 --> 01:48:58,074
我可以让他们把音乐关小点
I can tell them to turn the music down...

2000
01:49:02,954 --> 01:49:04,061
那不是我的
That's not mine.

2001
01:49:04,422 --> 01:49:07,404
我们需要查验身份 把手放在看得见的地方
Ok, we gonna need identification, keep your hand where we can see 'em

2002
01:49:07,405 --> 01:49:08,734
噢 天啊
Oh, my God.

2003
01:49:09,013 --> 01:49:10,642
你口袋里有没有藏什么东西
Anything else in your pocket, I should know about?

2004
01:49:10,642 --> 01:49:11,544
没有 长官 没有

2008
01:49:23,868 --> 01:49:25,800
- 这个呢 - 是我的吸入器
- And this? - That's my inhaler.

2009
01:49:26,920 --> 01:49:27,985

How old are you?

2010
01:49:29,115 --> 01:49:30,293
21岁
I'm 21

2011

我21岁了
I'm 21

2013
01:49:33,605 --> 01:49:35,832
说谎只会更糟
Lying only would make it worst!

2014
01:49:36,809 --> 01:49:38,739
对不起 我不该撒谎的
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have lied.

2015
01:49:50,485 --> 01:49:54,502
- 喂 - 听着 出事了…
- Hello? - Listen, something's happen...

2016
01:50:01,501 --> 01:50:02,335

Shit.

2017
01:50:02,335 --> 01:50:05,320
没事的 没事的 我已经保释了
It's alright, it's gonna be alright. I've posted bond.

2018
01:50:05,320 --> 01:50:08,790
