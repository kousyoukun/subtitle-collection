1
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:38,416
<i>I remember Mom named me Chaladlert</i>

2
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,416
<i>because I was born on the same date</i>
<i>as Thomas Alva Edison.</i>

3
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:45,250
<i>It means intelligent.</i>
<i>Mom wanted me to be as bright as him.</i>

4
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,458
<i>I was raised to be observant.</i>

5
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:49,083
<i>I'm curious about everything.</i>

6
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:52,333
<i>And, sometimes,</i>
<i>that curiosity leads me to strange things.</i>

7
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:53,625
<i>It's quite unusual.</i>

8
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:58,166
<i>Yeah.</i>

9
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:00,625
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

10
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:02,666
A STUDY INTO ANIMAL BREEDING

11
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:07,500
<i>And when I find bizarre stuff</i>
<i>I don't understand,</i>

12
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:10,583
<i>I always rely on the most experienced</i>
<i>member in the family.</i>

13
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:14,458
What the hell. Can't hear nothing.

14
00:01:15,416 --> 00:01:18,833
It's broken again. I'm so done with this.

15
00:01:18,916 --> 00:01:20,916
Grandpa!

16
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:27,166
There's something wrong with a woman
in the VCD. She makes weird sounds.

17
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:31,958
She sounds like that, Grandpa.

18
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:33,916
Aiya!

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,291
I can't hear anything, Chaladlert.

20
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:38,000
Can you speak up?

21
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:41,083
-Louder!
-Oh, my God!

22
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:46,458
One more time. Louder!

23
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:47,875
More!

24
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:49,291
-Come on.
-Bang me!

25
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:50,500
Don't stop.

26
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:56,541
Bang me!

27
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:03,500
<i>Then my parents passed away.</i>

28
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:08,000
<i>I mean, two years after that.</i>

29
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:11,750
<i>Since then, Aunt Balloon has stepped in</i>

30
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:13,208
<i>to take care of the house.</i>

31
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:17,541
<i>Aunt Balloon is single.</i>

32
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:22,083
<i>Since she's taking care of me and Grandpa,</i>

33
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:24,708
<i>I haven't seen her going out with anyone.</i>

34
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,666
<i>She takes care of me like my mom.</i>

35
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:32,375
<i>So I'm very close to her.</i>

36
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:36,083
<i>I tell her and Grandpa everything.</i>
<i>And I mean, everything...</i>

37
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:37,333
<i>even...</i>

38
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:39,375
It's here!

39
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:41,083
Aunt Balloon! Grandpa!

40
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:44,333
It's here!

41
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,583
Aiya!

42
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:51,583
You got your pubes!

43
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:56,541
15+ IQ Krachoot

44
00:02:56,666 --> 00:03:00,625
<i>Grandpa once told me,</i>
<i>"Life doesn't begin at a certain age.</i>

45
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:03,541
<i>It begins whenever you realize it."</i>

46
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:05,625
<i>I never really got it</i>

47
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:07,125
<i>until I'm 15.</i>

48
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:10,833
<i>But you know what</i>
<i>most 15-year-old kids care about?</i>

49
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:19,916
Hey, what do you guys think it's like
when a penis penetrates a vagina?

50
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,333
O-Beu, no need to use those fancy terms.

51
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,291
Just say cock and pussy.

52
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:28,666
O-Yong, you don't get it.
I use them to avoid obscenity.

53
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,458
It's a scientific question.

54
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,416
Scientific?

55
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,750
Hey, hold on, I'm studying it.

56
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:43,375
And why do you need to
use my elbow as a pussy?

57
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:47,208
Because O-Yong's elbow
doesn't fit in the experiment.

58
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,208
<i>Your elbow is perfect, Chaladlert.</i>

59
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:53,083
It's fair and smooth.

60
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,541
It's the ideal pussy.

61
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,625
It provides realistic touch.

62
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,750
Chaladlert, don't be so hard on O-Yong.

63
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:06,125
I read a study paper.

64
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:09,541
It said that men think about sex
every 52 seconds.

65
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,458
O-Yong's just a man. It's totally normal

66
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:15,041
for him to be this horny.

67
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,625
<i>As you can see,</i>

68
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:20,333
<i>there are many things</i>
<i>a 15-year-old's interested in.</i>

69
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,250
<i>But for O-Yong and O-Beu,</i>

70
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:24,000
<i>the only thing they wanna do</i>

71
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:27,041
<i>is obsessing over sex.</i>

72
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:30,041
<i>They often use their brains</i>
<i>to gain sexual benefits.</i>

73
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:32,708
<i>You can say they're horny nerds.</i>

74
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:36,041
-Are you tired or hungry?
-It slipped out of my hands, Miss.

75
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:38,375
Let me help.

76
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:40,333
<i>Sorry, Miss.</i>

77
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:43,833
Don't worry.

78
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,250
<i>-Are you okay?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

79
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:48,750
Pomelos.

80
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,333
Janejira's are pomelos.

81
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,708
-Watermelons.
-Watermelons.

82
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:04,375
Cotton's are watermelons.

83
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,208
Eggs.

84
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,208
-Steamed buns.
-Steamed buns.

85
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:31,791
If you two don't stop messing around,
you'll lose to Sudarat.

86
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:33,875
Stop saying her name.

87
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,333
I'm sick of seeing her face
on the board every day.

88
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:41,708
CONGRATULATIONS TO
SUDARAT CHALARDYEUNYONG

89
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:45,708
In the study paper I read,

90
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,583
women think about sex once a day.

91
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:51,541
I think Sudarat probably
thinks about sex three times a day.

92
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,083
What? When?

93
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:56,250
At noon, for example.

94
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:59,000
<i>She watches the seniors play basketball.</i>

95
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:02,125
<i>I think she's there for the smell.</i>

96
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:06,083
<i>The smell of the sweat arouses her deeply.</i>

97
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:07,333
<i>Apart from that,</i>

98
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:11,791
<i>Sudarat must be thinking about sex</i>
<i>when she's licking an ice cream cone.</i>

99
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:14,541
<i>A virgin like Sudarat</i>

100
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:18,666
<i>must be wondering what a penis feels like.</i>

101
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:23,333
<i>And the moment Sudarat thinks</i>
<i>about sex the most is when she wakes up.</i>

102
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:26,625
What? Why is that?

103
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:30,125
Well, normally when men wake up,
they have an erection.

104
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:31,666
Women have that, too!

105
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,916
But women don't have penises.
Where can they get an erection?

106
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:41,458
<i>Nipples!</i>

107
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:47,041
<i>You can see their nipples erect</i>
<i>through their pajamas in the morning.</i>

108
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:53,833
You're talking nonsense, right?

109
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:55,916
I'll go study now.

110
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:01,916
Sudarat!

111
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:21,625
What's on your arm?

112
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:24,833
Nothing.

113
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:26,833
SUDARAT CHALARDYEUNYONG

114
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:30,916
You're always messing around.

115
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:33,625
That's why you never succeed in anything.

116
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,125
-Was that a dig at us?
-Not at me.

117
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,875
<i>Sudarat...</i>

118
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:45,458
<i>is someone who's always</i>
<i>the best in everything she does.</i>

119
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:48,000
<i>Well, she really lives up to her name.</i>

120
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:50,916
<i>Because Sudarat means a perfect lady.</i>

121
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:53,875
<i>But it's also this perfection</i>

122
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:56,125
<i>that makes people dislike Sudarat.</i>

123
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:58,041
<i>And to make the matter worse,</i>

124
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:01,500
<i>teachers use Sudarat as a standard</i>
<i>for skirt length measurement.</i>

125
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:02,416
Inappropriate.

126
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:05,166
<i>Shorter or longer than hers</i>
<i>means inappropriate.</i>

127
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,958
Too long. Inappropriate.

128
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:18,125
<i>Sudarat is considered a good student,</i>
<i>praised by every teacher.</i>

129
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,250
<i>Especially,...</i>

130
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,166
Miss Janya's here.

131
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:32,375
Attention, please.

132
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:38,166
-Good morning, Miss.
-Sit down.

133
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,250
Do you know?

134
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:49,333
When doctors make a mistake,
a patient dies.

135
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:54,291
When pilots makes a mistake,
all passengers die.

136
00:08:56,041 --> 00:09:00,750
But when teachers make a mistake,
the future of a country's gone.

137
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,083
Every one of you is the nation's future.

138
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:07,166
Therefore, I have the responsibility
to improve you.

139
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:10,416
I'd like you all to know

140
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,916
that getting to wear
the uniform of this school

141
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,708
is a great honor.

142
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:21,958
That's why you must keep improving.

143
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:27,666
The last thing I want to talk about
during this homeroom...

144
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,625
is this year's
Science Project Competition.

145
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:36,041
The team behind the selected project

146
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:39,625
will get a chance to participate
in a seminar in Japan.

147
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:41,958
Wow, Japan!

148
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:43,958
Silence!

149
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,625
And this year's topic is...

150
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:52,166
an invention when you're 30.

151
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:56,375
This topic aims to make you
understand how adults think,

152
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,791
to urge you to learn to think like adults.

153
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,458
We don't want student projects anymore.

154
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:08,166
But we're still 15-16 years old.

155
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,958
How can we understand a 30-year-old?

156
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,000
Well, that's the objective.

157
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:15,916
We want you to grow up, Chaladlert.

158
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,041
O-Beu, let's go grab a bite.

159
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,375
Suchada.

160
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,125
<i>-I'll tell you a secret.</i>
-I'm hungry.

161
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:40,041
-Let's go eat something.
<i>-Actually,</i>

162
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:42,875
<i>I have a crush on one of my classmates.</i>

163
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:46,833
<i>She's the reason why I try</i>
<i>to excel at school</i>

164
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:49,958
<i>so that I get to be</i>
<i>in the same class as her.</i>

165
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:56,958
<i>But last semester,</i>

166
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,125
LAST SEMESTER

167
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:27,916
Sorry, I didn't mean to do that.

168
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:33,125
Anyway, do you want this book?

169
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:41,333
Oh, no problem. You can have it.

170
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,958
I read it so many times.

171
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:45,750
You like science fiction?

172
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:49,125
Yes. I love sci-fi movies as well.

173
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,500
Especially Spielberg's and Nolan's.

174
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:55,125
I love Spielberg, too.
What's your favorite?

175
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,166
E.T.?

176
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:00,500
I really love it.

177
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:04,125
Yes! I love it, too.

178
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:07,958
I'm so obsessed with aliens.
That's why I love it.

179
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:10,833
And you, Chaladlert,
you think aliens are real?

180
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:14,500
You know my name?

181
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:17,208
Yeah, of course.

182
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:19,500
We're classmates.

183
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:22,708
That's true.

184
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,916
And do you even know my name?

185
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:28,375
Of course! Cherry Suchada Ngamkanokwan!

186
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,291
Wow, you know my full name.

187
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:35,833
Nickname, first name and last name.

188
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:42,666
I think it must be so beautiful on Saturn.

189
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,791
It's probably orange...

190
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:49,291
I think it'd be cool if we have a lot
of alien friends. You ever wanna go there?

191
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:52,875
<i>Although Cherry looks more</i>
<i>like a half-Caucasian.</i>

192
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:56,333
<i>she has this weird provincial accent.</i>

193
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:58,583
<i>But that's the reason</i>

194
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,750
<i>why everyone likes her,</i>

195
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,833
<i>including me.</i>

196
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,000
Hey!

197
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:33,500
What's the matter?

198
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,583
No, nothing.

199
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:43,208
Hey, Cherry.

200
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:47,541
Do you feel a bit cold?

201
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,833
Not really, it's actually kinda hot.

202
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,916
Oh, I got it.

203
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:09,750
Hey, have you watched
2001: A Space Odyssey?

204
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,291
This one.

205
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:17,083
Oh, the best sci-fi movie of all time?

206
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,625
Yeah.

207
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:23,000
It's such a complex story.

208
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,750
I don't really understand it.

209
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:29,041
Especially the part where there's
this black and long thing.

210
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,291
Do you understand it?

211
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,750
Oh.

212
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,500
The black and long...

213
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:41,166
you mean the black monolith?

214
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,958
<i>It's a feeling I'd never known before.</i>

215
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:07,375
<i>The texture feels like an orange,</i>
<i>a potato fruit or a tomato.</i>

216
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:11,375
<i>It's like a new territory for me.</i>

217
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:15,541
You pervert!

218
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:23,541
<i>Even now, I still ask myself, why didn't I</i>
<i>just ask Cherry to pick up that pen?</i>

219
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:27,708
<i>I don't know how my brains</i>
<i>told me to do that to Cherry.</i>

220
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:38,083
<i>Since then, I haven't had</i>
<i>any guts to talk to her.</i>

221
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:42,083
<i>It feels like my high school life's over.</i>

222
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:50,541
Chaladlert.

223
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:53,500
We only have one-hour lunch break.

224
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:57,583
You should go do something useful
rather than sitting here.

225
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,083
I'm saying this as your class rep.

226
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,833
Umm...

227
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,625
-What?
-All right.

228
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,833
Hey, for this year's science project,

229
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:20,666
if we copy the idea in this book,
we'll get to go to Japan for sure.

230
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:54,916
Wanna microspore to ovule?

231
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:58,583
No, Top.

232
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,333
<i>That's Top.</i>

233
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:26,000
<i>The most handsome senior in the school.</i>

234
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:30,208
Every girl says that he's even
more handsome than some superstars.

235
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,750
<i>Goddamn hot.</i>

236
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:35,750
<i>You can tell even from behind.</i>

237
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,166
He's the school's treasure.

238
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:43,750
The senior girls rules that he must be
a public figure for everyone to share.

239
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:50,791
That means no one can go out with him
because he's a public treasure.

240
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,583
Top!

241
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:04,541
Top!

242
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,500
When will he finish washing?
He's a mermaid or what?

243
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:09,583
Suchada.

244
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,541
I'll take the trash out, okay?

245
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:13,666
Okay, got it.

246
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:25,291
Cherry, please stop.

247
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:28,875
I saw you today at the library.

248
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:41,750
You can't go out with Top.

249
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:44,000
He's a public figure.

250
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,458
He can't love you.

251
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:48,666
It's my business. Mind your own.

252
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,000
But I like you, Cherry.

253
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,291
<i>I really like you.</i>

254
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,375
I like you a lot.

255
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:09,291
Thank you.

256
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,583
But I like older men.

257
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:17,125
I like someone who's smarter.
You seem like a good guy.

258
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:21,416
But you're really not my type.

259
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:34,791
What if I won
the Science Project Competition?

260
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:39,208
Will you give me a chance then?

261
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,833
It's irrelevant.

262
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:45,625
It will be a proof that I'm more mature

263
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,666
and smarter like Top.

264
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:51,500
So you stop getting involved
with a public figure.

265
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:55,250
If you wanna beat me
in the Science Project Competition,

266
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:59,583
you need to beat Sudarat as well.

267
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:02,666
Because we're on the same team.

268
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:16,583
O-Beu, what size is the biggest boob size?

269
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:18,458
I did some research. It's Cup E.

270
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:21,291
You wanna know why?

271
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,666
O-Beu. O-Yong.

272
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,458
Let's submit a science project.

273
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,000
I think we'll nail it.

274
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:31,500
We used to build a rocket. Remember?

275
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:32,958
You mean Chuwit No.7?

276
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:37,958
Don't you remember what happened to that?

277
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:48,333
TRIAMPARINYA

278
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:06,541
Launch the rocket.

279
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,000
Standby for the launch.

280
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,916
Five. Four.

281
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:42,083
Three. Two. One.

282
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:46,750
There it goes. Yeah! Yeah!

283
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:48,541
It's up there!

284
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:51,416
Wow, it worked.

285
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:55,916
The rocket! Watch out!

286
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,291
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

287
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:02,875
Hey! Don't come back to Daddy!

288
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:11,333
Spread your legs, Miss!

289
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:27,416
It's coming back!

290
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:34,083
Chuwit, you've done well!

291
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:35,541
Move!

292
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:48,708
Hold on, that's not what happened.

293
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:54,541
Damn, I really thought
you were good, O-Yong.

294
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:56,666
You're good with rockets.

295
00:22:56,916 --> 00:22:59,041
I'm good with rockets.

296
00:22:59,416 --> 00:23:02,083
But I mean cock rocket.

297
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:04,708
Not funny?

298
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:08,000
Damn, Chaladlert.

299
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:10,708
We can never beat Sudarat anyway.

300
00:23:11,416 --> 00:23:13,583
We're not as smart as her.

301
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:22,583
Since we can't beat Sudarat,
why don't we steal her brains?

302
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:24,416
<i>Steal her invention plan.</i>

303
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:27,666
Make it ours and beat her in the end.

304
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:28,791
<i>Well, I think...</i>

305
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:31,416
that's probably not a good idea.

306
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:36,291
But my plan is not only to steal her idea,

307
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:38,958
but to also ruin her academically.

308
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:40,958
Have you ever been warned by adults?

309
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:44,083
Don't fall in love while in school
because it'll ruin your future.

310
00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:47,125
I think this theory's perfect.

311
00:23:47,291 --> 00:23:49,125
Sudarat has never been in love.

312
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:50,875
And if you make her fall for you...

313
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:56,041
She won't be able to focus at school
because she's obsessed with him?

314
00:23:56,708 --> 00:23:58,166
But she's not into anyone.

315
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,333
How could you know?
She likes you, Chaladlert.

316
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:11,958
O-Yong, have you seen
my Chemistry notebook?

317
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:13,458
No.

318
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:16,375
Oh, I totally forgot, Chaladlert.

319
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:19,208
Sudarat kept the notebook for you.

320
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:26,666
Can I have my notebook?

321
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:28,416
You probably haven't noticed

322
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,208
but I've seen it for a while.

323
00:24:31,458 --> 00:24:35,208
Chaladlert is the only guy in school
that Sudarat keep things for.

324
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:40,708
She's just keeping things for me.
That doesn't mean she likes me.

325
00:24:40,791 --> 00:24:42,583
Besides, I don't know how to flirt.

326
00:24:42,875 --> 00:24:45,666
Yeah, Sudarat looks kinda dull.

327
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:47,750
Probably hard to flirt with.

328
00:24:48,125 --> 00:24:50,125
I figured that out.

329
00:24:50,208 --> 00:24:51,791
Smart girls' problem is...

330
00:24:51,916 --> 00:24:54,125
Small boobs because
they overuse their brains.

331
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:56,000
So the boobs shrink.

332
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:57,125
Shrink my ass.

333
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:02,583
A problem with Sudarat is that
she has low estrogen levels.

334
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:06,208
Low estrogen levels in women
result in low sex drive.

335
00:25:06,416 --> 00:25:08,000
Sudarat has low estrogen levels.

336
00:25:08,333 --> 00:25:10,000
Hence, low sex drive.

337
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:13,666
I see. So if Sudarat
has higher estrogen levels,

338
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,583
she'll have normal levels of sex drive.

339
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:20,083
Your plan is so sick and evil.
That's how I like it.

340
00:25:20,208 --> 00:25:21,250
You can count me out.

341
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:28,875
-What's wrong with him?
-No idea.

342
00:25:30,958 --> 00:25:32,416
Yes.

343
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:35,291
Yes. I'm almost there.

344
00:25:36,041 --> 00:25:37,333
Okay.

345
00:25:39,833 --> 00:25:41,375
Vice.

346
00:25:44,208 --> 00:25:47,583
70 percent of 15-year-old boys
that come home this late

347
00:25:47,666 --> 00:25:49,208
engage in some vice.

348
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:53,916
Not me.

349
00:25:54,541 --> 00:25:55,708
Really?

350
00:25:56,916 --> 00:25:58,541
What about that Cherry thing?

351
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:02,250
CHALADLERT 0 SUDARAT 1

352
00:26:03,291 --> 00:26:05,416
It's not like what you think.

353
00:26:05,916 --> 00:26:07,291
I know you didn't mean it.

354
00:26:07,416 --> 00:26:10,625
It's me who told Cherry
that it was just an accident.

355
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:13,416
Naive boys like you
don't have dirty thoughts.

356
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:16,666
CHALADLERT 0 SUDARAT 2

357
00:26:20,833 --> 00:26:22,708
I heard you're submitting a project.

358
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,375
Why's that?

359
00:26:28,541 --> 00:26:29,791
Cherry told you?

360
00:26:29,916 --> 00:26:31,416
I know everything.

361
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,333
So, about Top...

362
00:26:34,875 --> 00:26:36,125
Top?

363
00:26:39,916 --> 00:26:40,958
What about him?

364
00:26:42,125 --> 00:26:47,208
That means you don't really know
everything that's going on at school.

365
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,583
CHALADLERT 1 SUDARAT 2

366
00:26:58,291 --> 00:27:01,458
Yeah. I'm not a nosy type.

367
00:27:03,541 --> 00:27:05,666
CHALADLERT 1 SUDARAT 100

368
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:08,958
But, this year, I'll beat you!

369
00:27:32,208 --> 00:27:34,750
<i>Wanna microspore to ovule?</i>

370
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,166
<i>Wanna microspore to ovule?</i>

371
00:27:40,833 --> 00:27:43,625
CHERRY: DID YOU SAY
SOMETHING TO SUDARAT?

372
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:49,083
CHALADLERT: NO, I DIDN'T.

373
00:27:49,166 --> 00:27:52,416
CHERRY: SHE'S PRESSING ME ABOUT TOP.

374
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,750
CHERRY: PLEASE LEAVE ME ALONE.

375
00:27:54,833 --> 00:27:56,500
CHERRY: IT'S MY BUSINESS.

376
00:27:58,291 --> 00:28:00,333
CHALADLERT:
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

377
00:28:02,208 --> 00:28:03,666
CHERRY: THIS USER'S BLOCKED YOU.

378
00:28:10,875 --> 00:28:12,750
Hold on a minute.

379
00:28:13,416 --> 00:28:16,291
What is microspore to ovule?

380
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,083
SEARCH OR PASTE URL

381
00:28:19,416 --> 00:28:21,708
MICROSPORE TO OVULE

382
00:28:27,958 --> 00:28:32,583
<i>Microspore to ovule, put simply,</i>
<i>is sexual reproduction in cherry blossoms.</i>

383
00:28:33,875 --> 00:28:38,208
No!

384
00:28:44,916 --> 00:28:48,416
<i>To prevent Cherry from</i>
<i>"microspore to ovule" with Top,</i>

385
00:28:48,708 --> 00:28:52,250
<i>I really need to win this year's</i>
<i>Science Project Competition.</i>

386
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:54,833
Sympathetic activity.

387
00:28:56,333 --> 00:28:58,125
What does that mean?

388
00:29:01,083 --> 00:29:05,041
Lately, have you been experiencing
increased heart rate?

389
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:09,208
When you get your heart broken,

390
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:11,166
you feel the pain in your heart

391
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:14,333
because the brains induce
sympathetic activity,

392
00:29:16,833 --> 00:29:18,791
sending your heart into overdrive.

393
00:29:22,125 --> 00:29:23,500
You mean about Cherry?

394
00:29:24,166 --> 00:29:25,791
Don't worry.

395
00:29:25,875 --> 00:29:28,458
You'll adjust in three-four days.

396
00:29:28,541 --> 00:29:31,250
The symptoms of sympathetic activity
will subside.

397
00:29:32,833 --> 00:29:38,041
And about winning
the competition to prove yourself...

398
00:29:38,333 --> 00:29:40,708
let me tell you, that's nuts.

399
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:43,625
What do you mean? I don't get it.

400
00:29:44,541 --> 00:29:47,750
Nuts also means insanely stupid.

401
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:51,041
I think that's stupid of you.

402
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,208
So you're nuts.

403
00:30:02,458 --> 00:30:04,666
Just you wait, Sudarat. This year,...

404
00:30:05,458 --> 00:30:08,541
my friends and I will win the competition!

405
00:30:25,083 --> 00:30:27,791
Aunt Balloon.

406
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,583
Aunt Balloon.

407
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,250
Aunt Balloon.

408
00:30:37,875 --> 00:30:38,791
Shit!

409
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:40,375
Hey, help me!

410
00:30:40,958 --> 00:30:43,666
-Come on!
-Damn.

411
00:30:45,125 --> 00:30:47,708
Hey, piggy!

412
00:30:48,041 --> 00:30:49,375
Oh, my God.

413
00:30:51,375 --> 00:30:52,666
Are you okay, piggy?

414
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:58,958
It's alright. I'm okay.

415
00:31:03,958 --> 00:31:06,833
So can I help you with anything?

416
00:31:07,375 --> 00:31:09,000
Here's the thing, Aunt.

417
00:31:09,083 --> 00:31:12,083
Our project's topic is
"an invention when you're 30."

418
00:31:12,416 --> 00:31:13,791
So we think

419
00:31:13,875 --> 00:31:16,291
the only way to win the competition

420
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:19,583
is to find out how a 30-year-old thinks.

421
00:31:20,333 --> 00:31:23,833
And you happen to be of that age.

422
00:31:24,041 --> 00:31:25,708
So my friends think that...

423
00:31:25,791 --> 00:31:28,500
You can probably help us
understand adults.

424
00:31:28,583 --> 00:31:31,500
If it was you, how would you think?
What would you do?

425
00:31:31,916 --> 00:31:33,666
It'd be our starting point.

426
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:38,333
Oh, give me a minute, okay?

427
00:31:57,583 --> 00:31:58,958
Take as long as you want.

428
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,333
This is nice.

429
00:32:06,916 --> 00:32:09,291
Hey, I got something!

430
00:32:09,375 --> 00:32:14,333
So people in their 30s
often worry about their figures,

431
00:32:14,458 --> 00:32:15,958
and appearances.

432
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:20,958
Their skin's not as good as
when they were in their 20s.

433
00:32:21,208 --> 00:32:26,416
I think you guys should invent
some kind of a facial device.

434
00:32:26,541 --> 00:32:27,791
For anti-aging.

435
00:32:28,083 --> 00:32:31,375
Rewind a 30-year-old back to 20.

436
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,166
Isn't it cool?

437
00:32:34,125 --> 00:32:35,208
How about that?

438
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:42,250
So what's now?

439
00:32:44,458 --> 00:32:46,416
Scientists must have plan Bs.

440
00:32:50,375 --> 00:32:52,375
Since the interview didn't work,

441
00:32:52,458 --> 00:32:56,666
we're forced to use our eyes
to gather information about a 30-year-old.

442
00:32:58,458 --> 00:33:01,416
Are you two studying her behavior or what?

443
00:33:02,291 --> 00:33:05,416
Very thoroughly.

444
00:33:16,416 --> 00:33:19,291
O-Yong, imagine with some censor blur on.

445
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:21,916
Everything looks dirty with censor blur.

446
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:01,833
Can you stop with the dirty looks?

447
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:04,333
Your vision will be blurry.

448
00:34:10,375 --> 00:34:11,708
I wanna eat that durian.

449
00:34:17,875 --> 00:34:21,416
<i>Later on, everyone at school</i>
<i>started their science projects.</i>

450
00:34:22,291 --> 00:34:24,125
<i>However, I'm still wondering</i>

451
00:34:24,208 --> 00:34:28,666
<i>whether their ideas could really be</i>
<i>considered as an invention when we're 30.</i>

452
00:34:38,583 --> 00:34:39,666
Why staring at the spoon?

453
00:34:42,666 --> 00:34:43,750
<i>Theoretically,</i>

454
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,083
human beings only use
the left brain for logic and analysis.

455
00:34:47,416 --> 00:34:50,875
<i>So I came up with an idea</i>
<i>to cut down the use of my left brain</i>

456
00:34:50,958 --> 00:34:52,958
<i>and use the right brain more</i>

457
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:54,916
<i>for intuition and creativity.</i>

458
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,541
<i>It would increase balance in your brain</i>

459
00:34:57,666 --> 00:35:00,750
and turn a "Homo Simple"
into a "Homo Excellent."

460
00:35:02,791 --> 00:35:04,208
"Homo Excellent"?

461
00:35:04,791 --> 00:35:07,791
That's your big man's invention, Pratya?

462
00:35:08,708 --> 00:35:10,583
Awesome, right? This year...

463
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:13,041
you can forget about Sudarat.

464
00:35:19,708 --> 00:35:21,916
You could improve your brain much more,

465
00:35:22,208 --> 00:35:23,708
just stare at something else.

466
00:35:25,625 --> 00:35:27,000
What?

467
00:35:30,166 --> 00:35:33,833
<i>You must use your brain</i>
<i>to channel the energy to lift the skirts</i>

468
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
<i>of intern teachers.</i>

469
00:35:35,708 --> 00:35:36,875
<i>If you think like this,</i>

470
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,166
<i>your right brain will work harder</i>
<i>and your left brain'll be less active.</i>

471
00:35:41,291 --> 00:35:43,708
<i>And your brain'll develop much faster.</i>

472
00:35:43,833 --> 00:35:46,291
Damn, O-Beu, you're a genius!

473
00:35:59,125 --> 00:36:01,583
See? He could come up with something

474
00:36:01,708 --> 00:36:03,208
even though it's nonsense.

475
00:36:04,875 --> 00:36:07,750
You can come up with something
but it's not a winning idea!

476
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:09,875
If his idea wins,

477
00:36:09,958 --> 00:36:12,541
it's the doom of our nation.

478
00:36:14,375 --> 00:36:17,125
So what do you guys wanna do?

479
00:36:18,458 --> 00:36:19,458
A band-aid?

480
00:36:20,125 --> 00:36:21,833
It's not just a normal band-aid.

481
00:36:22,041 --> 00:36:24,958
In the US, there are band-aids
with microneedle patch

482
00:36:25,208 --> 00:36:27,041
as an alternative to needles.

483
00:36:27,416 --> 00:36:30,208
-You imported it for this cause?
-No, I made it myself.

484
00:36:31,375 --> 00:36:33,875
I put some estrogen liquid on it.

485
00:36:34,791 --> 00:36:37,958
We just need to make a cut on Sudarat
and put the band-aid on.

486
00:36:38,375 --> 00:36:41,416
Her estrogen levels will go up.
So will her sex drive.

487
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:44,333
Such a simple but badass plan!

488
00:36:45,291 --> 00:36:46,791
I like that.

489
00:36:48,291 --> 00:36:51,333
But how can we make a cut on Sudarat?

490
00:36:56,541 --> 00:37:01,333
Lower the body, feet together,
lift the leg, arm's out, crimp fingers.

491
00:37:01,833 --> 00:37:03,291
Sword next to ear.

492
00:37:03,375 --> 00:37:06,041
This semester,
Miss Janya teaches Thai sword dance.

493
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,041
-Next to ear.
-Go near her.

494
00:37:08,625 --> 00:37:10,833
-Accidently hurt her.
-Lower the body.

495
00:37:11,791 --> 00:37:14,208
-Lift and attack.
-Chaladlert, go distract her.

496
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:16,208
You must impress her.

497
00:37:16,708 --> 00:37:17,916
Just move closer to her.

498
00:37:18,458 --> 00:37:21,458
-Crimp fingers, sword next to ear.
-Accidently hurt her.

499
00:37:21,583 --> 00:37:25,000
Chaladlert'd pretend to help her
by putting the band-aid on.

500
00:37:26,458 --> 00:37:27,500
What do I do?

501
00:37:27,708 --> 00:37:29,416
You go and practice the dance.

502
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,166
Show her how cool you are.

503
00:37:33,708 --> 00:37:36,875
-I'll go to the bathroom, okay?
-All right.

504
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:41,250
You can do it!

505
00:37:43,291 --> 00:37:44,166
But...

506
00:37:44,333 --> 00:37:46,708
-Chaladlert, you can do it.
-Chaladlert, you can do it.

507
00:37:46,916 --> 00:37:48,125
-You can do it.
-You can do it.

508
00:37:48,208 --> 00:37:49,458
-You can do it.
-You can do it.

509
00:37:49,791 --> 00:37:52,083
-You can do it.
-You can do it.

510
00:37:52,416 --> 00:37:53,625
-You can do it.
-You can do it.

511
00:37:59,958 --> 00:38:01,125
Damn it!

512
00:38:05,041 --> 00:38:08,583
Feet together, lift the leg, attack,

513
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,666
sword next to ear.

514
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:13,500
Left the leg, attack.

515
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,791
Lift the leg, feet together.

516
00:38:15,916 --> 00:38:16,750
Lift the leg,

517
00:38:16,833 --> 00:38:20,083
lower the body, feet together,
lift the leg, attack.

518
00:38:26,958 --> 00:38:28,750
What the hell are you doing?

519
00:38:29,416 --> 00:38:32,416
I'm practicing my sword dance.

520
00:38:32,958 --> 00:38:33,916
Isn't that cool?

521
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,916
Sudarat. Umm...

522
00:38:47,166 --> 00:38:50,750
I wanna thank you for...

523
00:38:50,833 --> 00:38:53,833
always keeping my notebook for me.

524
00:39:00,916 --> 00:39:02,541
That's it?

525
00:39:04,666 --> 00:39:06,375
If that's all then you can go now.

526
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,125
I'm gonna practice.

527
00:39:13,666 --> 00:39:15,625
Umm... Sudarat...

528
00:39:16,208 --> 00:39:18,416
I don't know how to flirt...

529
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,708
Can you help me with that?

530
00:39:34,458 --> 00:39:36,416
What do you mean?

531
00:39:39,916 --> 00:39:40,750
Well, the flirt...

532
00:39:41,708 --> 00:39:42,916
as in this dance move.

533
00:39:48,875 --> 00:39:50,125
What the...

534
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:56,250
Oh!

535
00:40:00,208 --> 00:40:01,708
-Move!
-All right.

536
00:40:01,833 --> 00:40:03,000
Here's the attack!

537
00:40:13,791 --> 00:40:16,375
May the Force be with you.

538
00:40:33,583 --> 00:40:37,000
You're attacking my friend?
You'll regret it!

539
00:40:56,583 --> 00:40:58,416
-Shit, blood!
-You deserved it.

540
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:00,875
You attacked me first.

541
00:41:01,291 --> 00:41:02,625
Where's my backup?

542
00:41:04,458 --> 00:41:05,916
Shit!

543
00:41:07,458 --> 00:41:09,250
Oh, you got a band-aid.

544
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,708
Put it on your friend.

545
00:41:11,916 --> 00:41:13,083
I'm fine. Never mind.

546
00:41:15,791 --> 00:41:17,000
Wait!

547
00:41:19,875 --> 00:41:21,833
-Whoa!
-Shit! Why is he here?

548
00:41:23,708 --> 00:41:26,166
No need to thank me. You're welcome.

549
00:41:26,958 --> 00:41:28,583
But I'm screwed.

550
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:35,083
Well,...

551
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,291
Cherry, let's go.

552
00:41:39,041 --> 00:41:40,666
Just leave them here.

553
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,583
I gotta go.

554
00:41:53,833 --> 00:41:56,458
-O-Beu, when will it work?
-<i>Don't worry.</i>

555
00:41:56,791 --> 00:41:59,166
I used a small amount of it.
Don't worry, O-Yong.

556
00:42:08,208 --> 00:42:10,500
O-Beu!

557
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,416
-O-Beu!
-This is not good, Chaladlert.

558
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,750
We must turn O-Yong off.

559
00:42:22,791 --> 00:42:25,416
-O-Beu!
-Chaladlert, attack the target.

560
00:42:27,458 --> 00:42:28,291
Hey, hold on!

561
00:42:32,291 --> 00:42:33,125
Stop, assholes!

562
00:42:34,458 --> 00:42:35,666
I was just kidding!

563
00:42:36,041 --> 00:42:37,916
Why are you beating me up?

564
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,625
The low amount can't affect me!

565
00:42:40,208 --> 00:42:41,291
Be realistic!

566
00:42:41,541 --> 00:42:44,708
Yeah, I know that.
I just wanna beat you up.

567
00:42:46,833 --> 00:42:48,708
I'm glad you're okay, O-Yong.

568
00:42:51,916 --> 00:42:56,166
O-Beu, now that our plan failed,
what do we do next?

569
00:42:59,625 --> 00:43:02,416
Scientists must have plan Bs.

570
00:43:11,416 --> 00:43:13,750
It's always beautiful up here.

571
00:43:14,125 --> 00:43:16,083
I haven't been here in a while.

572
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:23,583
Cherry.

573
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:26,833
I...

574
00:43:27,291 --> 00:43:29,583
I wanna ask about you and Top again.

575
00:43:29,958 --> 00:43:32,000
Me and Top?

576
00:43:32,375 --> 00:43:34,500
I already explained that.

577
00:43:38,666 --> 00:43:42,208
I still don't get it.

578
00:43:44,458 --> 00:43:48,333
I tried to come up
with reasons why you'd do it.

579
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,500
But it doesn't really help.

580
00:43:53,625 --> 00:43:56,000
-And...
-Just cut to the chase.

581
00:44:00,125 --> 00:44:02,208
Why did you do that kinda thing with Top?

582
00:44:03,583 --> 00:44:04,916
You must know in your heart

583
00:44:05,375 --> 00:44:06,916
that Top is a public figure

584
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,125
and one day...

585
00:44:11,458 --> 00:44:13,166
he may dump you.

586
00:44:15,125 --> 00:44:16,833
Thanks for your concern.

587
00:44:18,416 --> 00:44:23,208
But, sometimes, there are things
you can't really understand

588
00:44:23,291 --> 00:44:25,541
no matter how hard you try.

589
00:44:25,625 --> 00:44:28,333
Especially when it comes to love.

590
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:30,666
I don't really know

591
00:44:30,791 --> 00:44:35,458
how it will be between Top and me.

592
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,791
But I just follow my feelings.

593
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:44,541
I don't get you at all.

594
00:44:45,875 --> 00:44:49,875
You know, even if you read Romance
of the Three Kingdoms for ten times,

595
00:44:50,166 --> 00:44:52,291
you'll never understand love.

596
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:59,000
-But...
-Forget it.

597
00:44:59,708 --> 00:45:04,333
Even if you finish the novel, it's nothing
compared to being in love yourself.

598
00:45:24,125 --> 00:45:25,625
This is for you.

599
00:45:28,375 --> 00:45:31,041
That's perfect. I'm really sleepy. Thanks!

600
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,541
You're welcome. Goodbye.

601
00:45:54,458 --> 00:45:56,416
It's so sharp.

602
00:46:01,041 --> 00:46:07,125
I told you my plan would work.
Fruits with citric acid boost sex drive.

603
00:46:07,791 --> 00:46:10,208
But I think...

604
00:46:10,291 --> 00:46:13,500
-it's not a good idea, guys.
-If you're still not sure,

605
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:18,708
we can do the experiment
on people with slowest reactions first.

606
00:46:23,166 --> 00:46:26,333
-Hey, this is for you.
-Thanks.

607
00:46:26,916 --> 00:46:28,375
Oh, I'm too late.

608
00:46:51,083 --> 00:46:53,125
So sharp.

609
00:46:56,791 --> 00:47:00,333
Fruits with citric acid
surely boost sex drive.

610
00:48:21,666 --> 00:48:23,708
I have another plan up my sleeves.

611
00:48:23,791 --> 00:48:27,000
Chaladlert, you have to pretend
that you like Sudarat

612
00:48:27,083 --> 00:48:28,958
and bring her some snacks.

613
00:48:29,208 --> 00:48:31,291
When her crush brings her snacks,

614
00:48:31,416 --> 00:48:34,916
surely, she'll be delighted
and feeling hopeful for love.

615
00:48:38,666 --> 00:48:41,708
Just because of these
sex-drive boosting citrus fruits?

616
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:49,333
Sudarat.

617
00:48:51,916 --> 00:48:54,250
I bought it for you.

618
00:49:02,541 --> 00:49:04,083
I'm not Cherry.

619
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:05,708
Don't play nice to me.

620
00:49:08,208 --> 00:49:13,000
But I really meant
to buy you these citrus fruits.

621
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:18,125
But I like red beans, corns,

622
00:49:18,625 --> 00:49:19,458
pumpkins

623
00:49:20,083 --> 00:49:21,375
with unsaturated fat

624
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:25,083
like linoleic acid and oleic acid.

625
00:49:25,291 --> 00:49:28,125
They also contain serotonin
that helps you relax.

626
00:49:29,166 --> 00:49:33,416
But these fruits also contain Vitamin C.

627
00:49:33,625 --> 00:49:35,125
Do you know?

628
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:38,125
Reading a historical novel
really makes you smart

629
00:49:38,416 --> 00:49:40,208
and see through cheap tricks.

630
00:49:40,333 --> 00:49:41,666
What's your agenda?

631
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:45,625
I really don't have an agenda.

632
00:49:50,083 --> 00:49:53,583
If you don't believe me,
I can taste it for you.

633
00:50:42,958 --> 00:50:44,875
Hey, it's getting dark soon.

634
00:50:45,291 --> 00:50:46,666
You guys are not going home?

635
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:50,250
Why don't you go home together?
You're going the same way.

636
00:50:54,041 --> 00:50:57,166
Chaladlert, let's go home.

637
00:51:01,125 --> 00:51:02,541
Sorry.

638
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:10,875
Plot twist, O-Yong.

639
00:51:10,958 --> 00:51:13,000
Chaladlert did it!

640
00:51:13,916 --> 00:51:17,541
And what's your secret plan, you jackass?

641
00:51:46,125 --> 00:51:47,291
<i>Sudarat.</i>

642
00:51:47,708 --> 00:51:50,041
<i>I remember that she was so cute back then.</i>

643
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:53,000
<i>But she's changed a lot.</i>

644
00:51:53,083 --> 00:51:55,416
<i>Although we live in the same neighborhood</i>

645
00:51:55,833 --> 00:51:57,625
<i>and I often run into her,</i>

646
00:51:57,708 --> 00:52:01,333
<i>she's still somewhat unpredictable to me.</i>

647
00:52:01,833 --> 00:52:03,333
Hurry up.

648
00:52:04,166 --> 00:52:05,416
Okay.

649
00:52:14,416 --> 00:52:18,208
Why did you ask me
to join you on the way home?

650
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
I wanna walk quietly. Can we not talk?

651
00:52:22,166 --> 00:52:23,833
Here. Hold these for me.

652
00:52:25,583 --> 00:52:27,041
Sorry.

653
00:52:43,541 --> 00:52:47,083
So how is it going with your project?

654
00:52:47,916 --> 00:52:49,000
Oh,...

655
00:52:52,416 --> 00:52:55,958
I haven't come up with anything yet.

656
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:57,541
Okay.

657
00:52:57,625 --> 00:53:00,250
What about yours?

658
00:53:03,166 --> 00:53:05,500
It's about the origin of life.

659
00:53:08,625 --> 00:53:12,708
Why did you choose that topic?

660
00:53:13,291 --> 00:53:16,916
I believe in a theory
that life came to Earth on a meteorite.

661
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,666
Meteorites are like buses in the universe.

662
00:53:20,375 --> 00:53:23,333
Ingredients for life might've been
on those meteorites.

663
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:27,666
Life might've started
after meteorites crashed to Earth.

664
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:29,375
From unicellular organism,

665
00:53:29,458 --> 00:53:32,541
over many million years,
it evolved into us.

666
00:53:32,625 --> 00:53:34,583
As well as other beautiful things.

667
00:53:37,041 --> 00:53:39,250
Life is fascinating, don't you think?

668
00:53:39,625 --> 00:53:41,000
That's why I chose it.

669
00:53:52,208 --> 00:53:53,208
Wanna hang with me?

670
00:53:53,625 --> 00:53:54,750
What?

671
00:53:58,375 --> 00:54:00,250
My mom's not at home.

672
00:54:00,791 --> 00:54:05,291
And I'm doing some experiment.
I want your input.

673
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:09,833
All right.

674
00:54:45,083 --> 00:54:48,750
You brought me to your bedroom...

675
00:54:49,708 --> 00:54:51,333
I don't think it's a good idea.

676
00:54:52,583 --> 00:54:56,250
-I like that it's private.
-What? Private?

677
00:54:56,333 --> 00:54:57,708
Yeah.

678
00:55:09,625 --> 00:55:11,000
Hey, sit down.

679
00:55:11,291 --> 00:55:14,166
-Yeah.
-Hey. Why did you sit there?

680
00:55:14,458 --> 00:55:15,625
Come here.

681
00:55:16,958 --> 00:55:18,125
All right.

682
00:55:26,333 --> 00:55:29,750
You're so nervous.
Not cool and calm like your name suggests.

683
00:55:31,041 --> 00:55:32,750
I'm sorry.

684
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:38,416
Anyway, speaking of names,

685
00:55:38,708 --> 00:55:42,416
we're quite weird, right?
Both of us don't have nicknames.

686
00:55:44,583 --> 00:55:46,583
My mom refused to give me one.

687
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:49,708
She even told me not to have a nickname.

688
00:55:54,791 --> 00:55:59,250
Your mom probably wants you
to be a perfect lady like your name.

689
00:56:08,333 --> 00:56:11,125
Well, that kinda makes sense.

690
00:56:11,958 --> 00:56:13,500
How did you come up with that?

691
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:19,541
When my mom was still around,
she told me the same thing.

692
00:56:20,708 --> 00:56:23,166
She wanted me to be intelligent.

693
00:56:27,875 --> 00:56:31,208
Now it's more like the opposite of that.

694
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:37,125
Not as cool as when you were five.

695
00:56:39,625 --> 00:56:41,583
I was cool when I was five?

696
00:57:06,583 --> 00:57:10,750
You still remember these pants?

697
00:57:13,708 --> 00:57:17,125
<i>When I saw those pants,</i>
<i>I recognized them right away.</i>

698
00:57:17,208 --> 00:57:21,583
<i>I recalled that day</i>
<i>at the playground when I was five.</i>

699
00:57:21,666 --> 00:57:23,333
You peed yourself.

700
00:57:24,291 --> 00:57:28,333
You peed yourself.

701
00:57:29,791 --> 00:57:34,625
You peed yourself.

702
00:57:34,958 --> 00:57:38,708
You peed yourself.

703
00:57:38,958 --> 00:57:42,625
You peed yourself.

704
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:45,541
You peed yourself.

705
00:58:44,958 --> 00:58:47,166
You were my hero at that time.

706
00:58:51,666 --> 00:58:52,791
So...

707
00:58:53,791 --> 00:58:56,833
what's that experiment you talked about?

708
00:59:29,375 --> 00:59:31,333
AN INVENTION WHEN YOU'RE 30 YEARS OLD

709
00:59:36,958 --> 00:59:39,458
So what are we doing now?

710
00:59:41,291 --> 00:59:44,166
I'm dissecting a squid
to study its genitals.

711
00:59:47,541 --> 00:59:49,583
When squids mate,

712
00:59:49,708 --> 00:59:52,125
a male'd release
a capsule of sperm into a female.

713
00:59:53,291 --> 00:59:55,000
<i>And I wonder</i>

714
00:59:55,125 --> 00:59:58,875
where the genitals could be
on this flat squid.

715
00:59:59,666 --> 01:00:01,583
So I'm dissecting it.

716
01:00:01,791 --> 01:00:03,166
But I haven't found it.

717
01:00:05,416 --> 01:00:07,666
And why do you wanna know this?

718
01:00:10,291 --> 01:00:13,125
Because since I saw yours
when you were five,

719
01:00:13,208 --> 01:00:16,083
I've been wondering about male genitals.

720
01:00:19,208 --> 01:00:21,291
I haven't had any chance to see any since.

721
01:00:23,208 --> 01:00:25,666
That's why I study on animals instead.

722
01:00:28,208 --> 01:00:31,666
But now that you're here,
let me study you, okay?

723
01:00:34,916 --> 01:00:36,083
Sudarat!

724
01:00:39,666 --> 01:00:40,625
Suda...

725
01:00:40,916 --> 01:00:43,458
Don't be alarmed. I'm just studying it.

726
01:00:44,416 --> 01:00:45,958
What is this part called?

727
01:00:46,875 --> 01:00:47,708
Sudarat!

728
01:00:48,833 --> 01:00:49,666
Suda...

729
01:00:50,708 --> 01:00:51,750
rat.

730
01:00:51,833 --> 01:00:53,416
That's too tight.

731
01:01:12,583 --> 01:01:15,541
This Sunday, come and help me
write the Biology report here.

732
01:01:18,416 --> 01:01:19,500
I have to come again?

733
01:01:24,458 --> 01:01:26,000
All right.

734
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:54,583
Hey, how come mine is smaller?

735
01:01:54,958 --> 01:01:57,750
Your dildo is based on Thai standard size.

736
01:01:57,833 --> 01:02:01,166
-It's as good as it gets.
-Fine.

737
01:02:01,333 --> 01:02:04,208
I'll prove that sizes don't matter.

738
01:02:12,666 --> 01:02:14,125
Sudarat touched me!

739
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:24,708
-Sudarat touched my dick!
-What?

740
01:02:24,833 --> 01:02:28,916
She even forced me to help her
with her homework at home this Sunday.

741
01:02:30,791 --> 01:02:33,666
You know what?
You need to learn about sex.

742
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,875
What? Where can I do that?

743
01:02:39,458 --> 01:02:43,000
Scientists must have top secret plans.

744
01:02:48,041 --> 01:02:50,041
GOING TO THE DOCTOR. SEE YOU TONIGHT.

745
01:02:50,125 --> 01:02:52,750
<i>To clear the way so I can learn about sex,</i>

746
01:02:52,833 --> 01:02:54,875
<i>I had to destroy Grandpa's hearing aid</i>

747
01:02:54,958 --> 01:02:57,166
<i>to get my aunt and him</i>
<i>out of the the house.</i>

748
01:02:57,250 --> 01:03:01,000
<i>Now we can start our mission. However,...</i>

749
01:03:01,083 --> 01:03:04,125
Chaladlert, do we really
need to dress like this?

750
01:03:04,791 --> 01:03:06,875
O-Beu said, "Wear your dads' clothes."

751
01:03:06,958 --> 01:03:08,625
So we look more mature.

752
01:03:08,708 --> 01:03:10,791
We lied about our age.

753
01:03:10,875 --> 01:03:13,625
Yeah, I know.
But look at what that jerk's wearing.

754
01:03:19,208 --> 01:03:22,125
O-Beu, you told me
to wear my dad's clothes.

755
01:03:22,208 --> 01:03:23,958
Why a t-shirt with your mom's face?

756
01:03:24,541 --> 01:03:26,666
Well, this is my dad's t-shirt.

757
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:29,375
He owns a collection.
My parents are madly in love.

758
01:03:29,666 --> 01:03:32,333
Yeah? I thought that's a funeral pic.

759
01:03:35,708 --> 01:03:38,791
Hey, is this really a good idea?

760
01:03:38,875 --> 01:03:40,458
To do this in broad daylight?

761
01:03:43,625 --> 01:03:45,541
Dude, she's here.

762
01:03:47,833 --> 01:03:50,166
The door's not locked. Come in.

763
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:17,458
I normally take clients at night.

764
01:04:17,541 --> 01:04:20,000
But I saw that you guys are just kids.

765
01:04:20,083 --> 01:04:21,708
You shouldn't go to bed late.

766
01:04:24,125 --> 01:04:27,291
We're old enough
to have sexual intercourse,

767
01:04:27,375 --> 01:04:28,875
have a family and children.

768
01:04:29,041 --> 01:04:31,041
I'm not a kid anymore.

769
01:04:32,875 --> 01:04:35,125
Yeah, I believe you.

770
01:04:35,708 --> 01:04:39,166
So do we do it one by one

771
01:04:39,291 --> 01:04:42,666
or all together at the same time?

772
01:04:42,916 --> 01:04:44,666
-All together.
-All together.

773
01:04:46,958 --> 01:04:47,958
O-Yong!

774
01:04:50,666 --> 01:04:53,791
-My little piggy!
-Can you moan in a deep voice?

775
01:04:53,875 --> 01:04:56,666
O-Beu!

776
01:04:56,833 --> 01:04:58,583
Deep enough for you?

777
01:04:58,791 --> 01:05:01,083
I'm tired now. Please move to Chaladlert.

778
01:05:01,208 --> 01:05:03,083
Chaladlert!

779
01:05:04,583 --> 01:05:06,041
O-Yong!

780
01:05:06,291 --> 01:05:07,666
My name's O-Yong!

781
01:05:07,916 --> 01:05:09,958
Oh, yeah! Chaladlert!

782
01:05:10,166 --> 01:05:11,041
O-Beu!

783
01:05:11,166 --> 01:05:12,291
O-Yong!

784
01:05:16,958 --> 01:05:18,750
I've been watching videos.

785
01:05:18,833 --> 01:05:21,000
I finally got to see the real thing.

786
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:22,875
Please moan my name.

787
01:05:23,708 --> 01:05:25,125
O-Yong!

788
01:05:25,416 --> 01:05:28,458
O-Yong!

789
01:05:28,541 --> 01:05:32,000
Oh, yeah! O-Yong!

790
01:05:32,291 --> 01:05:34,000
Next step.

791
01:05:34,083 --> 01:05:35,833
This is a VR headset.

792
01:05:35,916 --> 01:05:38,958
You'll discover porn in 3D.
In all its glory.

793
01:05:39,291 --> 01:05:42,208
You'll get to experience it
like you're having sex yourself.

794
01:05:42,750 --> 01:05:43,875
Seriously?

795
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:46,625
This is how you learn about sex?

796
01:05:47,333 --> 01:05:49,958
I wanna know why we're doing all of this.

797
01:05:50,916 --> 01:05:52,750
It has nothing to do with stealing.

798
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,750
You must distract her

799
01:05:55,125 --> 01:05:58,208
by flirting with and seducing her
before stealing the plan.

800
01:05:58,500 --> 01:05:59,833
<i>If you succeed,</i>

801
01:05:59,916 --> 01:06:02,541
you could even make her

802
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:04,833
come up with another project!

803
01:06:05,125 --> 01:06:08,333
It's a win-win. You can never lose.

804
01:06:10,916 --> 01:06:14,375
Just put it on
and it'll feel like the real thing?

805
01:06:38,541 --> 01:06:39,583
Come here, boy.

806
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:47,291
I feel so hot.

807
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:50,458
Unbutton me, will you?

808
01:06:53,666 --> 01:06:54,875
My hands are full.

809
01:07:09,208 --> 01:07:10,500
That's better.

810
01:07:11,291 --> 01:07:12,875
Thank you.

811
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,166
So what is the last stop of this bus?

812
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:20,250
Oh, Makkasan.

813
01:07:27,125 --> 01:07:28,166
Where am I?

814
01:07:29,166 --> 01:07:30,916
You're in Makkasan.

815
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,833
And what are we doing here?

816
01:07:33,916 --> 01:07:35,458
Makkasan.

817
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:41,583
Makkasan is for making love.

818
01:07:41,666 --> 01:07:43,125
Is that right?

819
01:07:45,166 --> 01:07:46,250
Hey, bro.

820
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:47,875
Yeah?

821
01:07:48,916 --> 01:07:51,000
Can you help me?

822
01:07:51,708 --> 01:07:53,708
I want you to decide

823
01:07:53,875 --> 01:07:55,875
whether to untie me

824
01:07:56,916 --> 01:08:01,541
or help look if there's something
under my skirt.

825
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:03,875
All right.

826
01:08:15,791 --> 01:08:16,875
See anything?

827
01:08:20,833 --> 01:08:22,541
Help me!

828
01:08:23,416 --> 01:08:25,708
How can I help you?

829
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,291
We're all worried
we may have breast cancer.

830
01:08:31,375 --> 01:08:33,208
Can you check our breasts?

831
01:08:33,291 --> 01:08:35,000
Shouldn't you go to the doctor?

832
01:08:35,083 --> 01:08:38,833
There's no one here. Only you can help us.

833
01:08:38,916 --> 01:08:39,958
-Really?
-Please?

834
01:08:40,041 --> 01:08:41,333
-Please!
-Please!

835
01:08:41,416 --> 01:08:44,833
-Please!
-I'm not sure I can.

836
01:08:45,333 --> 01:08:47,458
-Umm...
-Please!

837
01:08:47,541 --> 01:08:49,583
-Please help me.
-Please.

838
01:08:50,083 --> 01:08:51,416
It's so realistic, guys.

839
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:55,500
Me again?

840
01:08:56,833 --> 01:08:57,916
It's always me!

841
01:09:03,541 --> 01:09:06,291
Keep thrusting! Keep thrusting!

842
01:09:09,208 --> 01:09:12,208
Keep thrusting! Keep thrusting!

843
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Keep thrusting!

844
01:09:25,583 --> 01:09:27,791
What the hell are you guys doing?

845
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,875
I think I'm scared of Sudarat.

846
01:09:42,541 --> 01:09:45,833
Why should you be?
She's stalking you like this.

847
01:09:46,125 --> 01:09:48,250
It means she likes you.

848
01:09:48,541 --> 01:09:53,791
I think her hormones
are all over the place.

849
01:09:54,958 --> 01:09:59,083
But are liking someone
and sexual feelings the same thing?

850
01:09:59,166 --> 01:10:01,708
It's a chain reaction.

851
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,625
But how can I be aroused
if I don't like Sudarat?

852
01:10:08,291 --> 01:10:09,583
-Right.
-Right.

853
01:10:10,458 --> 01:10:13,250
<i>And if I really like her?</i>

854
01:10:54,958 --> 01:10:56,875
-Wanna do it?
-What?

855
01:10:58,208 --> 01:10:59,416
What are we doing?

856
01:11:01,041 --> 01:11:02,250
The Biology paper.

857
01:11:03,958 --> 01:11:06,416
Have you finished your Physics paper?

858
01:11:07,208 --> 01:11:11,333
Oh, yeah. We can start now.

859
01:11:12,333 --> 01:11:13,750
Okay.

860
01:11:17,875 --> 01:11:19,958
Reproduction and development.

861
01:11:22,666 --> 01:11:26,375
I wanna add some facts about animals.
You think it's a good idea?

862
01:11:26,875 --> 01:11:27,875
Yeah.

863
01:11:29,458 --> 01:11:30,750
Oh, I read it somewhere

864
01:11:30,833 --> 01:11:36,041
that when flatworms mate,
they do this "penis fencing."

865
01:11:37,041 --> 01:11:40,333
-Flatworms, right?
-Okay.

866
01:11:41,333 --> 01:11:44,541
Oh, pandas, as well

867
01:11:45,041 --> 01:11:48,875
The zoo staff must show pandas
some panda porn to arouse them.

868
01:11:49,416 --> 01:11:50,250
What?

869
01:11:51,250 --> 01:11:54,500
But why do they do that?

870
01:11:55,708 --> 01:11:59,500
Because pandas only
think about sex 24-72 hours a year.

871
01:11:59,583 --> 01:12:02,541
To prevent extinction,
they must be aroused to reproduce.

872
01:12:03,458 --> 01:12:04,458
Isn't that funny?

873
01:12:38,458 --> 01:12:40,166
<i>I don't know what happened.</i>

874
01:12:40,583 --> 01:12:42,583
<i>Everything's blurry.</i>

875
01:12:43,625 --> 01:12:45,500
<i>I can't remember anything.</i>

876
01:12:46,041 --> 01:12:47,708
<i>Next thing I know,...</i>

877
01:12:47,791 --> 01:12:51,750
<i>I've lost my virginity to Sudarat.</i>

878
01:12:56,291 --> 01:12:58,416
There's no blood at all.

879
01:12:58,916 --> 01:13:02,000
<i>How can I know for sure</i>
<i>that I lost my virginity?</i>

880
01:13:03,625 --> 01:13:06,291
No idea.

881
01:13:16,166 --> 01:13:17,541
Sudarat.

882
01:13:19,041 --> 01:13:20,208
Umm...

883
01:13:20,625 --> 01:13:22,583
can I ask you something?

884
01:13:24,875 --> 01:13:28,458
I mean why...

885
01:13:29,958 --> 01:13:31,291
did we...

886
01:13:31,416 --> 01:13:33,166
Ever since I was little...

887
01:13:35,083 --> 01:13:36,916
I never really understand

888
01:13:38,375 --> 01:13:39,916
why my dad left my mom and me.

889
01:13:43,583 --> 01:13:45,708
So I never believe in relationships.

890
01:13:47,750 --> 01:13:49,833
I put all my energy into studying.

891
01:13:53,541 --> 01:13:55,166
But now...

892
01:13:57,625 --> 01:13:59,458
I started to feel something...

893
01:14:03,541 --> 01:14:06,041
when I'm close to you.

894
01:14:08,083 --> 01:14:10,916
I wanna believe in relationships again.

895
01:14:46,041 --> 01:14:48,958
O-YONG: YOU GOT THE PLAN?

896
01:15:14,541 --> 01:15:17,250
AN INVENTION WHEN YOU'RE 30 YEARS OLD

897
01:15:17,333 --> 01:15:19,958
WHAT DO PEOPLE WANT AT 30?

898
01:15:55,916 --> 01:15:58,666
<i>Even though I got Sudarat's plan,</i>

899
01:15:59,083 --> 01:16:03,583
<i>my feelings somehow prevent me</i>
<i>from following up with my plan.</i>

900
01:16:03,666 --> 01:16:07,041
<i>I don't know whether I feel guilty</i>
<i>or feel something about Sudarat.</i>

901
01:16:07,125 --> 01:16:09,125
<i>I'm not sure what's wrong with me.</i>

902
01:16:17,625 --> 01:16:19,791
I got the plan.

903
01:16:23,125 --> 01:16:25,583
Hey, you guys.

904
01:16:26,333 --> 01:16:27,166
I think...

905
01:16:27,291 --> 01:16:28,916
Apart from the plan,

906
01:16:29,625 --> 01:16:34,250
you also got something else, right?

907
01:16:34,375 --> 01:16:37,041
Yeah, I got the Biology paper done.

908
01:16:37,166 --> 01:16:39,208
Just the Biology paper?

909
01:16:39,625 --> 01:16:41,666
Didn't you also work on Physiology?

910
01:16:41,833 --> 01:16:43,541
Explain it to me in details.

911
01:16:43,875 --> 01:16:47,583
What steps did you take?

912
01:16:48,416 --> 01:16:49,291
What steps?

913
01:16:49,416 --> 01:16:50,958
Steps to sexual intercourse!

914
01:16:51,166 --> 01:16:53,000
What? Hold on.

915
01:16:54,333 --> 01:16:55,458
That's not the point.

916
01:16:56,333 --> 01:16:58,375
What about the science project?

917
01:16:58,875 --> 01:17:00,833
That's a sub topic.

918
01:17:00,916 --> 01:17:02,916
Sexual intercourse is the main topic.

919
01:17:03,541 --> 01:17:05,166
So we have to discuss

920
01:17:05,250 --> 01:17:07,750
about methods of sexual intercourse

921
01:17:07,833 --> 01:17:09,833
and every step in details.

922
01:17:09,916 --> 01:17:13,750
So you asked me to go steal
Sudarat's plan for what?

923
01:17:13,833 --> 01:17:16,458
To troll her, Chaladlert.

924
01:17:17,541 --> 01:17:19,625
But I never thought

925
01:17:20,250 --> 01:17:22,458
that it would come this far.

926
01:17:22,541 --> 01:17:24,416
You're the man, Chaladlert!

927
01:17:24,666 --> 01:17:28,833
So when you lost your virginity to her...

928
01:17:29,791 --> 01:17:31,208
what did it feel like?

929
01:17:34,166 --> 01:17:35,250
Sudarat!

930
01:17:42,541 --> 01:17:44,208
Sudarat, let me go!

931
01:17:56,625 --> 01:17:58,166
I...

932
01:18:00,666 --> 01:18:01,541
I...

933
01:18:02,250 --> 01:18:03,166
I...

934
01:18:05,458 --> 01:18:07,083
I won't say anything.

935
01:18:08,916 --> 01:18:10,500
I'm on to your stupid game.

936
01:18:10,875 --> 01:18:12,791
I know that you wanted to steal my plan

937
01:18:13,916 --> 01:18:15,291
but I just wanted to see

938
01:18:15,375 --> 01:18:17,583
if you're that kind of guy. So I let you.

939
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,416
I also wanted to see
if I could put up with it.

940
01:18:22,541 --> 01:18:24,041
Now I know!

941
01:18:31,125 --> 01:18:32,000
Sudarat!

942
01:18:32,416 --> 01:18:34,166
Let me explain, Sudarat!

943
01:18:48,583 --> 01:18:51,500
Sudarat got me every time!

944
01:18:51,916 --> 01:18:55,750
-O-Beu, you have to come up with plan B.
-Don't worry.

945
01:18:56,458 --> 01:18:59,541
Scientists must have...

946
01:18:59,791 --> 01:19:01,166
What?

947
01:19:02,666 --> 01:19:04,958
Do you feel something, too?

948
01:19:09,666 --> 01:19:11,750
I'm not done with you guys yet!

949
01:19:13,666 --> 01:19:16,875
<i>No...</i>

950
01:19:24,833 --> 01:19:28,291
<i>Since that day,</i>
<i>I haven't talked to Sudarat at all.</i>

951
01:19:29,833 --> 01:19:31,666
<i>I know she's mad.</i>

952
01:19:32,083 --> 01:19:34,125
<i>I feel bad myself.</i>

953
01:19:34,208 --> 01:19:36,416
<i>But I don't know what to do.</i>

954
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:40,208
I...

955
01:19:51,583 --> 01:19:53,791
BIOLOGY

956
01:20:01,875 --> 01:20:08,166
ONE MONTH LATER

957
01:20:08,958 --> 01:20:10,250
Hey.

958
01:20:12,666 --> 01:20:15,250
You have any problems with Sudarat?

959
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:24,583
You know that Sudarat likes you, right?

960
01:20:27,791 --> 01:20:30,458
What do you really think about her?

961
01:20:32,416 --> 01:20:34,291
You know full well who I like.

962
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,541
But now...

963
01:20:42,666 --> 01:20:44,500
I'm not sure anymore.

964
01:20:46,958 --> 01:20:50,625
And I don't really know how I feel.

965
01:20:51,041 --> 01:20:55,041
Whatever you decide,
just do it before it's too late.

966
01:20:55,916 --> 01:20:57,458
Don't worry.

967
01:20:58,250 --> 01:21:00,791
Scientists always have plan Bs.

968
01:21:01,125 --> 01:21:03,458
What plan Bs are you talking about?

969
01:21:28,875 --> 01:21:30,583
NA

970
01:21:31,708 --> 01:21:35,333
CI

971
01:21:35,416 --> 01:21:37,125
You know what it means, right?

972
01:21:39,541 --> 01:21:40,958
So what?

973
01:21:41,375 --> 01:21:43,250
You're sodium.

974
01:21:43,666 --> 01:21:45,416
I'm chlorine.

975
01:21:46,333 --> 01:21:47,916
Together, it's sodium chloride.

976
01:21:48,750 --> 01:21:50,625
It's essential for life.

977
01:21:51,625 --> 01:21:53,458
I need you in my life, Sudarat.

978
01:21:55,708 --> 01:21:57,458
I'm sorry.

979
01:22:01,541 --> 01:22:04,833
CI

980
01:22:05,583 --> 01:22:07,958
You still know about embryo?

981
01:22:09,541 --> 01:22:13,083
Oh, it's the early developmental stage
of animals or plants.

982
01:22:13,166 --> 01:22:14,875
I'm pregnant.

983
01:22:15,750 --> 01:22:19,791
CI

984
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:25,416
But don't worry, I have a plan B.

985
01:22:27,541 --> 01:22:29,083
But...

986
01:22:29,916 --> 01:22:31,625
how is that possible?

987
01:22:33,333 --> 01:22:36,625
Hey, snap out of it.

988
01:22:37,333 --> 01:22:40,708
Tell my mom first
and then your family, okay?

989
01:22:41,083 --> 01:22:41,916
Wait.

990
01:22:43,666 --> 01:22:47,375
This is such a big deal.

991
01:22:50,083 --> 01:22:51,708
I'm too afraid to tell them.

992
01:22:51,791 --> 01:22:54,166
You know, Mom has high hope for me.

993
01:22:55,083 --> 01:22:57,250
But then something like this happened.

994
01:22:57,791 --> 01:22:59,166
What do you think she'd say?

995
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:06,291
You and your friends
planned to ruin my life.

996
01:23:07,625 --> 01:23:09,125
And now...

997
01:23:10,875 --> 01:23:12,500
you're really ruining it.

998
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,125
SUDARAT CHALARDYEUNYONG

999
01:23:32,291 --> 01:23:33,833
SUDARAT CHALARDYEUNYONG

1000
01:23:33,916 --> 01:23:35,666
Will you answer me now?

1001
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:40,458
Why did this happen to you?

1002
01:23:42,625 --> 01:23:45,125
I had such high hope for you.

1003
01:23:46,625 --> 01:23:49,875
BUTTON YOUR UNIFORM PROPERLY
LIKE SUDARAT

1004
01:23:51,958 --> 01:23:54,083
Why is Miss Janya late today?

1005
01:24:00,208 --> 01:24:01,666
Can you reach her?

1006
01:24:02,458 --> 01:24:03,625
Not yet.

1007
01:24:14,791 --> 01:24:17,708
Attention, please!

1008
01:24:21,625 --> 01:24:23,750
-Good morning, Miss.
-Good morning, Miss.

1009
01:24:28,833 --> 01:24:31,250
I have an announcement to make.

1010
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,750
Sudarat, your class representative,

1011
01:24:34,916 --> 01:24:36,708
asked for a semester leave.

1012
01:24:39,958 --> 01:24:43,750
Therefore, Suchada will become
the project leader instead.

1013
01:24:48,458 --> 01:24:50,666
Take your book out. Let's begin.

1014
01:24:57,875 --> 01:25:00,125
10TH GRADE, CLASS 1

1015
01:25:06,041 --> 01:25:07,583
Chaladlert.

1016
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:10,166
What's wrong with Sudarat?

1017
01:25:12,208 --> 01:25:15,375
We haven't even submitted any plans.

1018
01:25:15,458 --> 01:25:17,500
I'm scared of her now.

1019
01:25:20,833 --> 01:25:22,250
Chaladlert!

1020
01:25:23,708 --> 01:25:26,291
Hey, Chaladlert.

1021
01:26:25,416 --> 01:26:26,958
Umm...

1022
01:26:27,041 --> 01:26:29,333
I would like to...

1023
01:26:31,625 --> 01:26:37,583
Well, we discussed it at home.
We talked about what happened.

1024
01:26:37,916 --> 01:26:40,541
And we'd like to take care of the baby.

1025
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:44,291
What baby? There's no baby here.

1026
01:26:51,625 --> 01:26:53,416
What does that mean?

1027
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:58,333
I'm begging you.

1028
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,208
You can't do that.

1029
01:27:04,166 --> 01:27:05,916
Please.

1030
01:27:20,750 --> 01:27:22,500
You guys should leave.

1031
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:29,666
-We decided to have an abortion.
-No, Sudarat!

1032
01:27:30,750 --> 01:27:32,500
That's a human being!

1033
01:27:36,583 --> 01:27:37,625
Don't be so naive!

1034
01:27:38,833 --> 01:27:41,333
In science, it's just a cell.

1035
01:27:41,416 --> 01:27:43,333
It's just a tissue even.

1036
01:27:47,541 --> 01:27:49,166
Are we done now?

1037
01:27:51,333 --> 01:27:52,958
See yourself out.

1038
01:28:03,250 --> 01:28:04,916
I can't believe this.

1039
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,708
How could did happen, Chaladlert?

1040
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:12,916
If your parents knew,
they would be very disappointed in me.

1041
01:28:15,208 --> 01:28:18,791
Balloon, don't blame yourself like that.

1042
01:28:19,291 --> 01:28:22,083
We must not blame anyone.

1043
01:28:22,166 --> 01:28:25,166
It's not really anyone's fault.

1044
01:28:25,291 --> 01:28:27,416
The most important thing is,

1045
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:31,250
Chaladlert, what are you going to do now?

1046
01:28:34,583 --> 01:28:36,375
I'm feeling hurt.

1047
01:28:38,291 --> 01:28:40,125
Hurt inside, Grandpa.

1048
01:28:41,375 --> 01:28:42,833
But I don't know what it is.

1049
01:28:44,750 --> 01:28:46,375
I just know that...

1050
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:48,958
I'm responsible for this.

1051
01:29:01,750 --> 01:29:04,875
CENTER OF MASS

1052
01:29:04,958 --> 01:29:09,458
<i>So, what is it like to be an adult?</i>

1053
01:29:10,916 --> 01:29:12,791
If you ask me,

1054
01:29:12,875 --> 01:29:17,500
I think life is just like
a scientific experiment.

1055
01:29:17,708 --> 01:29:21,625
You need to experiment time and again.

1056
01:29:21,708 --> 01:29:25,458
Sometimes, you succeed.
Sometimes, you fail.

1057
01:29:25,541 --> 01:29:27,250
No matter how many times you fail,

1058
01:29:27,875 --> 01:29:29,875
<i>you must go on.</i>

1059
01:29:30,416 --> 01:29:34,208
I've been experimenting for 60-70 years.

1060
01:29:34,291 --> 01:29:39,208
Yet, I still don't know
whether I'm a good adult.

1061
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:43,000
WHEN YOU'RE 30?

1062
01:30:05,958 --> 01:30:07,666
What's on your mind?

1063
01:30:08,125 --> 01:30:09,916
Hey, you can tell us anything.

1064
01:30:10,541 --> 01:30:12,666
Your aunt's worried about you.

1065
01:30:15,208 --> 01:30:17,916
If you wanna create that adult invention,

1066
01:30:18,791 --> 01:30:20,583
what would you do?

1067
01:30:22,708 --> 01:30:27,000
I think the topic of the project
is too complicated for me to understand.

1068
01:30:27,416 --> 01:30:30,250
If it was me, I'd do what I like.

1069
01:30:30,583 --> 01:30:34,666
To be honest,
I don't really get that topic anyway.

1070
01:30:34,750 --> 01:30:37,916
But that's not the big problem anymore.

1071
01:30:39,875 --> 01:30:41,416
You're right, O-Beu.

1072
01:30:41,875 --> 01:30:44,000
The science project's not the problem

1073
01:30:45,291 --> 01:30:48,250
but it may be the question
that leads to my answer.

1074
01:30:50,125 --> 01:30:53,583
I really need to know
what our adult invention is.

1075
01:30:54,416 --> 01:30:55,791
-What do we do?
-What do we do?

1076
01:31:00,166 --> 01:31:03,125
Scientists must always have plan Bs.

1077
01:31:03,916 --> 01:31:05,833
AN INVENTION WHEN YOU'RE 30?

1078
01:31:05,916 --> 01:31:06,875
What if...

1079
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:13,583
there wasn't anything that represented
what we'd invent when we're 30?

1080
01:31:14,250 --> 01:31:15,708
Therefore,...

1081
01:31:16,541 --> 01:31:20,000
the definition of being an adult

1082
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:22,375
may not really exist.

1083
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:26,541
It may be just a theory
that people came up with.

1084
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:31,333
What are you talking about, dude?
I don't get it.

1085
01:31:31,583 --> 01:31:35,625
I know now what my adult invention is.

1086
01:31:37,208 --> 01:31:39,916
All right. Just tell me what you wanna do.

1087
01:31:41,708 --> 01:31:45,041
Yeah, I don't dare to offer
any ideas anymore.

1088
01:31:46,375 --> 01:31:49,208
So what is it?
The invention when we're 30.

1089
01:31:49,291 --> 01:31:50,708
What do we have to do?

1090
01:31:52,166 --> 01:31:53,958
Let's do something we do best.

1091
01:31:56,208 --> 01:31:58,833
AN INVENTION WHEN YOU'RE 30?

1092
01:32:03,333 --> 01:32:08,000
Sudarat, if you hear me, I wanna tell you

1093
01:32:08,458 --> 01:32:11,875
I know what my invention when I'm 30 is.

1094
01:32:12,958 --> 01:32:14,291
Sudarat!

1095
01:32:14,791 --> 01:32:15,916
Sudarat!

1096
01:32:18,458 --> 01:32:20,791
Take your goddamn rocket out of my house!

1097
01:32:22,500 --> 01:32:26,041
Chaladlert, don't waste time.
Let's launch the rocket.

1098
01:32:26,125 --> 01:32:27,916
SUDARAT 8

1099
01:32:35,916 --> 01:32:37,500
Ready, Chaladlert?

1100
01:32:39,458 --> 01:32:41,083
Five. Four. Three. Two. One.

1101
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,750
That's it. That's what we do best.

1102
01:32:50,416 --> 01:32:52,708
-Being a loser!
-Chaladlert, go!

1103
01:32:53,458 --> 01:32:54,875
-Come on!
-Come on!

1104
01:32:59,041 --> 01:33:00,416
Stop!

1105
01:33:00,500 --> 01:33:03,000
-Miss!
-Hold on.

1106
01:33:09,708 --> 01:33:11,000
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

1107
01:33:12,333 --> 01:33:13,291
Hey!

1108
01:33:13,750 --> 01:33:16,875
When will you stop with these shenanigans?

1109
01:33:24,083 --> 01:33:24,958
I'm sorry.

1110
01:33:25,750 --> 01:33:27,000
I...

1111
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:31,458
I just wanna show you my invention plan.

1112
01:33:59,416 --> 01:34:01,333
It's empty.

1113
01:34:01,875 --> 01:34:05,125
Yes, it's an empty plan.

1114
01:34:06,541 --> 01:34:10,458
Because the invention
is still in your womb.

1115
01:34:14,541 --> 01:34:16,625
If we turn 30...

1116
01:34:17,625 --> 01:34:22,083
the cell in your womb
would be 15 years old like us now.

1117
01:34:23,916 --> 01:34:25,458
This 15-year-old...

1118
01:34:26,666 --> 01:34:28,708
is the invention when we're 30.

1119
01:34:38,333 --> 01:34:39,750
Sudarat!

1120
01:34:40,833 --> 01:34:42,333
What will you do?

1121
01:35:01,958 --> 01:35:03,375
Mom.

1122
01:35:06,291 --> 01:35:08,458
I can't really destroy...

1123
01:35:10,166 --> 01:35:12,041
my own invention.

1124
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,166
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

1125
01:35:39,291 --> 01:35:41,541
Hey, the rocket worked!

1126
01:35:45,208 --> 01:35:47,041
<i>Grandpa once told me,</i>

1127
01:35:47,333 --> 01:35:50,833
<i>"Life doesn't begin at a certain age.</i>

1128
01:35:50,916 --> 01:35:53,791
<i>It begins whenever you realize it."</i>

1129
01:35:54,583 --> 01:35:57,500
<i>I never really got it</i>

1130
01:35:57,583 --> 01:36:01,208
<i>but now I think I kinda get it.</i>

1131
01:36:24,625 --> 01:36:26,666
Why are you so late?

1132
01:36:28,166 --> 01:36:30,916
I was browsing the library shelves.

1133
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:32,666
I don't know what to read.

1134
01:36:33,666 --> 01:36:36,708
What are you reading, by the way?

1135
01:36:38,625 --> 01:36:39,958
Sit down.

1136
01:36:43,041 --> 01:36:45,916
The book says that,
during the first three months,

1137
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:50,125
the baby's weight will increase
700-800 grams on average per month.

1138
01:36:50,208 --> 01:36:53,000
It could be more or less than that.

1139
01:36:53,083 --> 01:36:55,500
And, during the second trimester,

1140
01:36:55,583 --> 01:36:58,375
it increases 500-600 grams per month.

1141
01:36:59,583 --> 01:37:02,291
The older it grows,
the less the weight increase.

1142
01:37:02,375 --> 01:37:07,125
The baby's growth may slow
due to teeth development.

1143
01:37:07,875 --> 01:37:10,500
There may be decrease in appetite.

1144
01:37:22,875 --> 01:37:25,625
Hey, Pratya won the Science Project award?

1145
01:37:26,333 --> 01:37:28,708
I think our nation is doomed.

1146
01:37:33,125 --> 01:37:35,375
Why are they so crazy about Top?

1147
01:37:35,458 --> 01:37:37,333
I wanna see what he looks like.

1148
01:37:44,666 --> 01:37:47,833
They're going crazy for Pratya
who looks like that?

1149
01:37:48,250 --> 01:37:50,708
Should we try staring at spoons like him?

1150
01:40:59,125 --> 01:41:01,125
