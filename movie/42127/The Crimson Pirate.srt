1
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,760
Man the yards! Quick on all canvas!

2
00:00:22,706 --> 00:00:24,901
Gather round, lads and lasses.
Gather round.

3
00:00:25,075 --> 00:00:28,511
You've been shanghaied aboard
for the last cruise of the Crimson Pirate...

4
00:00:28,578 --> 00:00:31,342
a long, long time ago
in the far, far Caribbean.

5
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:35,214
Remember, in a pirate ship,
in pirate waters, in a pirate world...

6
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:38,415
ask no questions.
Believe only what you see.

7
00:00:45,061 --> 00:00:47,825
No. Believe half of what you see.

8
00:00:49,699 --> 00:00:52,327
Man the capstan! Up anchor!

9
00:00:52,869 --> 00:00:54,769
Move, you lubbers!

10
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,991
Ship to starboard!

11
00:02:36,606 --> 00:02:37,732
Attention!

12
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,718
A scurvy ship, Your Excellency.

13
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:57,359
You can tell by the position of the limbs.
Scurvy's killed the whole crew.

14
00:03:02,298 --> 00:03:04,926
A trim little ship, Captain Rodríguez.

15
00:03:05,301 --> 00:03:08,361
We'll take her in tow.
She'll bring a tidy sum.

16
00:03:09,205 --> 00:03:12,697
Put an officer and two men aboard her,
and have her in tow by nightfall.

17
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,037
Aye, aye, sir.

18
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,901
- Only evil can come from a death ship.
- Aye.

19
00:04:17,573 --> 00:04:19,598
Sanctus, one of them touched me!

20
00:04:20,777 --> 00:04:22,768
What happened to those two?

21
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:24,775
Follow me.

22
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:03,017
My humble apologies.

23
00:07:06,142 --> 00:07:07,074
Bored?

24
00:07:07,143 --> 00:07:10,738
lf only there was something
to break the monotony of this voyage.

25
00:07:11,881 --> 00:07:13,678
Hands aloft, please.

26
00:07:20,823 --> 00:07:23,656
You're the prisoners of Captain Vallo
and his scurvy crew.

27
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,337
You may be overconfident, Captain Vallo.

28
00:07:43,412 --> 00:07:46,040
Two hundred of the King's marines
are aboard this vessel.

29
00:07:46,115 --> 00:07:49,175
And only 20 pirates.
That puts the odds slightly in my favor.

30
00:07:49,252 --> 00:07:52,449
- Better surrender the ship.
- l am merely a passenger.

31
00:07:53,089 --> 00:07:54,989
- Who is he?
- Baron Gruda.

32
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:57,287
Special envoy to His Majesty.

33
00:07:58,995 --> 00:08:01,793
Well, this is a pleasure.

34
00:08:02,198 --> 00:08:05,565
- You hanged most of my friends.
- For murdering most of mine.

35
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:12,401
Seems you have
only 199 marines now, Baron.

36
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:17,443
198. Better persuade the Captain
to surrender.

37
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,343
The Captain is not the type to...

38
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,607
197.

39
00:08:22,685 --> 00:08:25,779
However, if you'll permit me
to speak to him...

40
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,518
Ojo, pass the word for the Captain.

41
00:08:38,167 --> 00:08:40,897
Bring down the Captain!

42
00:08:41,671 --> 00:08:43,901
Send down the Captain!

43
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,431
Save the Captain!

44
00:08:46,509 --> 00:08:48,534
Send down the Captain!

45
00:08:52,582 --> 00:08:54,846
Did you ask for the Captain, sir?

46
00:08:54,917 --> 00:08:57,818
Aye. Pay him my compliments
and show him in.

47
00:09:27,516 --> 00:09:29,541
Gather round, lads. Gather round.

48
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:35,248
We're in luck.

49
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:38,191
All hands will soon be digging into
a fat divvy.

50
00:09:39,595 --> 00:09:42,826
We're heading for the biggest
and the best pirate days ever.

51
00:09:42,898 --> 00:09:45,799
And here's the rich tally in round numbers.

52
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,497
"Muskets: 3,000.

53
00:09:49,272 --> 00:09:51,263
"Powder kegs: 1,500.

54
00:09:51,941 --> 00:09:54,933
"Rounds of musket shot: 65,000.

55
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:59,375
- "Rounds of cannon shot..."
- Begging thy pardon for interrupting...

56
00:09:59,782 --> 00:10:01,977
but when will thee get into the gold?

57
00:10:05,488 --> 00:10:07,115
Listen, fellows, listen.

58
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:10,886
There are islands in these waters
steaming with rebellion against the King...

59
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,020
and kept from boiling over
only for lack of guns.

60
00:10:14,096 --> 00:10:16,860
lslands where guns
are worth more than gold.

61
00:10:16,932 --> 00:10:19,230
- More than diamonds.
- Gunrunning?

62
00:10:19,302 --> 00:10:22,499
But that's not piracy, Skipper.
That's business.

63
00:10:22,571 --> 00:10:26,302
- That means working ashore.
- We're doing poorly enough afloat.

64
00:10:26,842 --> 00:10:30,300
lf we're going to try this new caper,
let's make it a good one.

65
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:35,282
This cargo will bring 50,000 gold florin
from any rebels worth the name.

66
00:10:35,351 --> 00:10:38,787
- 50,000 florin?
- That's a pretty good take.

67
00:10:38,854 --> 00:10:41,186
Let's put it to the vote. All those in favor...

68
00:10:41,257 --> 00:10:44,021
lf you'll forgive my interrupting, Skipper...

69
00:10:44,093 --> 00:10:46,687
l'd like to think before l vote.

70
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:50,362
Meantime, we got
regular pirate business to settle.

71
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:54,202
We got the plank, the culprit,
and the verdict.

72
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:57,933
All we need's a trial
and execution of a sentence.

73
00:10:58,007 --> 00:10:59,235
He's guilty!

74
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:02,408
So much for the trial. Now for execution.

75
00:11:03,446 --> 00:11:05,414
Come on. Kill me, you fools.

76
00:11:05,481 --> 00:11:09,918
The King's Navy will scour the Seven Seas
till every one of you is hung high and dry.

77
00:11:09,985 --> 00:11:12,886
- To the plank with him!
- Avast!

78
00:11:21,063 --> 00:11:23,031
There'll be no plank-walking for him.

79
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,499
Forgive my slow-wittedness, Skipper...

80
00:11:25,568 --> 00:11:29,504
but are thee asking us to spare
this sweet-smelling toad?

81
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:32,505
Begging Thy Excellency's pardon.

82
00:11:32,575 --> 00:11:35,738
Your captain's got more brains
than all of you put together.

83
00:11:35,811 --> 00:11:38,006
No doubt you intend
to hold me for ransom.

84
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,572
No, my fine-feathered friend.
l'm setting you free.

85
00:11:42,585 --> 00:11:46,248
l say, if there's no profit in the monkey
we'll have our pleasure.

86
00:11:46,322 --> 00:11:48,415
l say there is profit in him. Alive.

87
00:11:48,491 --> 00:11:50,823
- How much profit?
- Now hear me out.

88
00:11:53,195 --> 00:11:56,460
l said 50,000 gold florin
from the rebels for the guns...

89
00:11:56,532 --> 00:12:00,662
and here, by special commission,
is the King's chief rebel-catcher.

90
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:04,068
So why not another 50,000
from him and his king...

91
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,904
for telling them which rebels
we sell all the guns to.

92
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,102
Eh, Baron?

93
00:12:08,177 --> 00:12:10,941
A brilliant scheme, Captain.
My congratulations.

94
00:12:11,013 --> 00:12:12,776
Thy congratulations.

95
00:12:13,582 --> 00:12:17,018
lf thou art for it,
it is not for the good of pirates.

96
00:12:17,086 --> 00:12:19,077
Good? Gentlemen, it's magnificent.

97
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:23,854
l'm bound for the lsland of Cobra to catch
a man, El Libre, and smash his rebellion.

98
00:12:24,126 --> 00:12:28,222
lf you'll take the guns there, lure him
out of his hole and into my hands...

99
00:12:28,297 --> 00:12:30,822
l'll raise the purse another 50,000.

100
00:12:31,734 --> 00:12:35,830
There it is, lads, in round figures:
150,000 florin.

101
00:12:39,108 --> 00:12:41,838
What do you say now,
Mr. Humble Bellows?

102
00:12:42,411 --> 00:12:45,244
Thy humble servant will believe it...

103
00:12:45,314 --> 00:12:47,612
when thy humble servant sees it.

104
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:50,817
l take it we have a deal, Captain.

105
00:13:22,751 --> 00:13:25,686
This change of ship, Captain,
most uncomfortable.

106
00:13:25,821 --> 00:13:29,052
My men won't transfer cargo.
Too much like honest work.

107
00:13:29,124 --> 00:13:32,616
Captain Vallo, your men have only left me
headsail and topsail.

108
00:13:32,695 --> 00:13:35,357
They're enough to get you to Cobra
sooner or later.

109
00:13:35,431 --> 00:13:37,592
My ship is faster than this barge.

110
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:41,329
l don't want you making port
before l've got El Libre ready for delivery...

111
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,462
or putting a shot in my backside.

112
00:13:43,539 --> 00:13:46,975
l hope El Libre is not as careful
as you are, Captain.

113
00:13:58,721 --> 00:14:00,712
Cast off helm!

114
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,786
Cast off stern!

115
00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:10,959
- Mr. Bellows, make sail!
- Aye, aye, sir!

116
00:14:36,191 --> 00:14:37,988
Haul up, full and by.

117
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:42,021
Nor' nor' east.
We're heading for the lsle of Cobra.

118
00:14:42,598 --> 00:14:44,657
Come on, you lubbers, move!

119
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,870
Hear ye, hear ye!

120
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:27,302
The King's vessel is now at anchor...

121
00:15:27,376 --> 00:15:30,834
in the port of Cobra
with Baron Gruda aboard.

122
00:15:30,913 --> 00:15:35,714
Any demonstration
will be regarded as high treason.

123
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,747
The people seem very quiet, don't they?

124
00:15:39,822 --> 00:15:43,349
l don't think they intend to demonstrate
against Baron Gruda after all.

125
00:15:43,425 --> 00:15:46,121
- Apparently not, Governor.
- What a pity.

126
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,789
Our troops could've cut them down
like wheat.

127
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,598
Couldn't we shoot a few
on general principles?

128
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:53,066
Might impress the Baron.

129
00:15:53,135 --> 00:15:55,501
He might feel
you are merely provoking trouble.

130
00:15:55,571 --> 00:15:58,836
Most exasperating.
Fire the salute to Baron Gruda.

131
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:02,975
Attention!

132
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:19,789
Give the word and l'll dose
those backstabbers with a broadside.

133
00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:22,461
They're not firing at us,
you powder-brained ape.

134
00:16:22,531 --> 00:16:26,729
They're giving us a 15-gun salute.
We're flying the flag of Gruda.

135
00:16:26,802 --> 00:16:29,999
Slimey, bring out the flags
and run up that message l gave you.

136
00:16:30,806 --> 00:16:33,468
And, Slimey,
give the Governor my compliments.

137
00:16:33,542 --> 00:16:35,066
The Crimson Pirate's?

138
00:16:35,144 --> 00:16:37,635
No, you oyster-head, Baron Gruda's.

139
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:42,009
Mr. Bellows, keep the rest of these
half-masted monkeys below deck.

140
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,381
Aye, aye, Skipper.

141
00:16:43,452 --> 00:16:46,512
Keep a sharp lookout, lads.
l'll be back with El Libre tonight.

142
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:48,112
Let's go, Ojo.

143
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:59,630
There goes a good pirate,
to sell his wares like a fish peddler.

144
00:17:00,169 --> 00:17:02,660
Meaning no disrespect to the Skipper,
of course.

145
00:17:02,738 --> 00:17:04,535
Us with a price on our heads...

146
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:08,838
holed, too, in one of His Majesty's ports
like sitting ducks.

147
00:17:09,578 --> 00:17:13,981
But if the Skipper pulls us through again,
we'd be the ducks with the golden eggs.

148
00:17:14,049 --> 00:17:17,541
You're thinking of geese,
if you'll pardon the correction, Poison Paul.

149
00:17:17,986 --> 00:17:20,887
Geese on a wild-goose chase.

150
00:17:32,234 --> 00:17:33,701
What do they say, Joseph?

151
00:17:33,769 --> 00:17:37,102
They've got the plague onboard,
and they're quarantining themselves...

152
00:17:37,172 --> 00:17:39,231
until the victims are killed or cured.

153
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:43,440
We must signal my profound condolences
to Baron Gruda.

154
00:17:43,512 --> 00:17:46,379
- Very well, Governor.
- Maybe it's all for the best, Joseph.

155
00:17:46,448 --> 00:17:48,814
El Libre's followers
may yet show their hands...

156
00:17:48,884 --> 00:17:51,717
and give me a chance to impress
the Baron. Order my carriage.

157
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:56,116
Disperse the crowd. Change the guard,
and double your patrols in the street.

158
00:17:57,392 --> 00:17:59,326
Come on, my popsy-wopsy-wopsies.

159
00:18:10,239 --> 00:18:14,300
Plague, is it? May it take all of them.
Baron Gruda first.

160
00:18:14,743 --> 00:18:17,371
Aye, and if the plague don't, we will.

161
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:22,575
- Who are you?
- Simple fisher folk like yourselves.

162
00:18:22,651 --> 00:18:26,644
Put in for a tankard of ale, a friendly word,
and a chance to fight the King.

163
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:31,048
Why choose us?

164
00:18:35,831 --> 00:18:37,628
You look and talk like a fighter.

165
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,533
lt takes one to know one.

166
00:18:39,601 --> 00:18:42,331
You may have us marked, all right.
Maybe not.

167
00:18:42,404 --> 00:18:44,395
But we haven't marked you yet.

168
00:18:44,473 --> 00:18:46,907
- We're asking no questions.
- We are.

169
00:18:47,843 --> 00:18:50,437
What l've heard about El Libre
is good enough for me.

170
00:18:50,512 --> 00:18:52,036
Tell us how to contact him.

171
00:18:52,114 --> 00:18:55,675
A man like him would be pleased to have
two more strong-armed lads aboard.

172
00:19:02,991 --> 00:19:04,959
Not very trusting souls, are they?

173
00:19:16,705 --> 00:19:19,970
l guess we'll have to prove
our high regard for El Libre.

174
00:19:32,855 --> 00:19:35,483
Ojo, you took the words
right out of my mouth.

175
00:19:35,557 --> 00:19:37,855
A brawl with the King's men. Let's go.

176
00:19:43,332 --> 00:19:47,291
Left, right. Left. Mark time!

177
00:19:50,172 --> 00:19:51,571
Right turn.

178
00:19:53,542 --> 00:19:54,600
Halt!

179
00:19:56,979 --> 00:20:00,881
Quick march! Forward! Halt! Turn!

180
00:20:09,992 --> 00:20:12,085
Right wheel!

181
00:20:17,232 --> 00:20:19,325
March!

182
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:22,763
Halt!

183
00:20:24,706 --> 00:20:26,537
Present arms!

184
00:20:57,072 --> 00:20:58,596
Long live the republic!

185
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,539
Rebels! Get them!

186
00:21:15,924 --> 00:21:17,391
Long live El Libre!

187
00:21:17,459 --> 00:21:18,858
After them!

188
00:22:01,436 --> 00:22:02,698
There they are!

189
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:05,706
Don't let them get away!

190
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,570
Men! Come on!

191
00:23:44,372 --> 00:23:46,237
Come on! Quick, in that corner.

192
00:23:47,442 --> 00:23:48,932
There they go!

193
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,551
Hurry up. ln back.

194
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,557
This way!

195
00:24:11,233 --> 00:24:12,222
Go ahead.

196
00:24:20,675 --> 00:24:21,835
Pierce the canvas.

197
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:36,782
Fire!

198
00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:45,459
Ready? Fire!

199
00:24:56,278 --> 00:24:59,247
Pick it up! Lift it up!
Come on. Lift it up! Fire!

200
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:04,779
Take us away.

201
00:25:07,155 --> 00:25:08,952
They're getting away!

202
00:25:27,242 --> 00:25:29,767
Latch the cellars! Block the alley!

203
00:25:45,594 --> 00:25:46,754
Look out. Soldiers.

204
00:25:52,934 --> 00:25:54,128
Just a minute.

205
00:26:04,379 --> 00:26:05,744
Search the place.

206
00:27:05,173 --> 00:27:08,108
- The stink would drive away a pig.
- Which it did.

207
00:27:09,678 --> 00:27:11,373
Watch that door.

208
00:27:17,786 --> 00:27:19,947
You've saved us, lad, you've saved us.

209
00:27:20,021 --> 00:27:21,852
We're among our own kind.

210
00:27:23,191 --> 00:27:24,419
Rebels.

211
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:27,194
Wouldn't surprise me
if you were El Libre himself.

212
00:27:27,429 --> 00:27:30,921
- You look like a born leader of men.
- The name's Pablo Murphy.

213
00:27:30,999 --> 00:27:34,799
And l got enough lrish from me father
to know blarney when l hear it.

214
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:37,701
We'd have slit your throats
for snooping spies by now...

215
00:27:37,772 --> 00:27:39,603
only for what you did to them soldiers.

216
00:27:39,674 --> 00:27:41,767
- Who are they?
- Who knows?

217
00:27:41,843 --> 00:27:44,334
This one can't talk
and this one can't keep quiet.

218
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:47,848
All right, let's get to the point.
l'm Captain Vallo at your service.

219
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,645
And this is Lieutenant Ojo.

220
00:27:52,887 --> 00:27:55,151
Vallo? The pirate?

221
00:27:55,223 --> 00:27:56,781
The Crimson Pirate?

222
00:27:56,858 --> 00:27:59,952
That's right, sweet mother,
with a bargain for El Libre...

223
00:28:00,028 --> 00:28:02,189
a shipload of powder shot and musketry.

224
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:04,663
- Baron Gruda's ship.
- Baron Gruda's ship?

225
00:28:04,733 --> 00:28:07,133
Aye. Baron Gruda's own 30-gunner.

226
00:28:07,669 --> 00:28:10,661
We took her as easy as you'd take
a mackerel, fine fishermen.

227
00:28:10,739 --> 00:28:13,003
Easier. For we used dead bait.

228
00:28:13,541 --> 00:28:15,532
You killed Baron Gruda?

229
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:19,770
lf l did that you wouldn't need the guns
l want to sell you.

230
00:28:19,848 --> 00:28:22,214
l'm a pirate, not a dog killer.

231
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:24,808
But l like you lads. l like your style.

232
00:28:24,886 --> 00:28:26,786
So gather round and get this:

233
00:28:26,855 --> 00:28:30,791
The Baron will arrive in port
aboard my own ship in a matter of days.

234
00:28:30,859 --> 00:28:34,795
So how about taking me to El Libre
so we can close the deal for the guns?

235
00:28:34,863 --> 00:28:36,763
Time and tide, you know.

236
00:28:57,552 --> 00:28:59,645
Wash the stink off them
and take them below.

237
00:28:59,721 --> 00:29:01,120
Pass the word along.

238
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:25,502
When it's dark,
we'll take them to the small boat...

239
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,810
and row them out to their ship.
Come with me.

240
00:29:40,795 --> 00:29:42,490
Now, you know what the plan is.

241
00:29:42,564 --> 00:29:44,930
The rest will join my lads
at the fishing boats...

242
00:29:44,999 --> 00:29:47,593
and stand by the pirate vessel
to receive the guns.

243
00:29:47,669 --> 00:29:49,830
Suppose the pirates
refuse to give them up?

244
00:29:49,904 --> 00:29:52,702
l'll keep my knife at Captain Vallo's throat.

245
00:29:52,774 --> 00:29:55,538
Either he'll give the order
to hand over the guns...

246
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:57,737
or he'll never give another order.

247
00:29:57,812 --> 00:30:01,009
You're cutting our throats,
Pablo Murphy, not his.

248
00:30:04,586 --> 00:30:07,180
l like your nerve, Pablo, but not your plan.

249
00:30:07,255 --> 00:30:11,385
l say we've got to get the guns and take
the palace before Baron Gruda gets here.

250
00:30:11,459 --> 00:30:15,122
And l say we need more than guns.
We need El Libre to lead us.

251
00:30:15,196 --> 00:30:17,994
You women won't face facts.
El Libre's been captured.

252
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,966
The way to face facts is to rescue him.

253
00:30:20,034 --> 00:30:22,594
Rescue him?
From the King's prison? lmpossible.

254
00:30:24,305 --> 00:30:28,469
Not for a desperate man
with a 30-gunner and a fighting crew.

255
00:30:28,977 --> 00:30:31,207
A pirate rescue for El Libre?

256
00:30:31,479 --> 00:30:34,880
That'd be taking him from the frying pan
and throwing him into the fire.

257
00:30:34,949 --> 00:30:37,417
- We'll handle this our own way.
- About face!

258
00:30:37,485 --> 00:30:38,645
Get over here.

259
00:31:21,396 --> 00:31:23,193
There's a meeting! The door, quick!

260
00:31:39,781 --> 00:31:41,248
Out! The other door!

261
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:05,064
lf l release you, can l count on your help?

262
00:32:06,774 --> 00:32:08,366
You'll be well paid.

263
00:32:26,661 --> 00:32:28,526
You misjudged our men.

264
00:32:28,997 --> 00:32:30,828
Don't misjudge our women.

265
00:32:32,333 --> 00:32:33,960
- Another door here.
- Where?

266
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,400
Follow me.

267
00:33:19,847 --> 00:33:23,374
- What's all the shooting?
- The Skipper coming back from market.

268
00:33:23,451 --> 00:33:26,215
l have a feeling we'll be putting out to sea.

269
00:33:26,287 --> 00:33:30,121
Hoist anchor. Man all canvas. Look lively!

270
00:33:30,291 --> 00:33:32,282
Man the yards!

271
00:33:36,864 --> 00:33:38,161
Prepare to fire!

272
00:33:43,371 --> 00:33:44,668
Fire one!

273
00:33:53,748 --> 00:33:55,045
Fire two!

274
00:34:10,264 --> 00:34:14,894
Signal Baron Gruda's ship for a broadside.
One of us can knock her out of the water.

275
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:39,718
Shore battery's asking for a broadside
against them, Mr. Bellows.

276
00:34:39,794 --> 00:34:42,285
What are you waiting for, drooling idiot?

277
00:34:42,363 --> 00:34:45,855
- Give 'em a broadside!
- Aye, aye, sir! One broadside coming up!

278
00:35:04,786 --> 00:35:06,777
Good shooting, lads. Well aimed.

279
00:35:07,288 --> 00:35:09,813
Skipper, be that
what thou bought at market?

280
00:35:11,592 --> 00:35:13,924
Take the lady below
and make her comfortable.

281
00:35:17,665 --> 00:35:19,394
Thank you, Captain.

282
00:35:22,236 --> 00:35:24,329
The gallant Captain Vallo, eh, lads?

283
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:32,274
Be that bit of fluff El Libre?

284
00:35:32,346 --> 00:35:34,541
That's the bit of fluff
that's taking us to him.

285
00:35:34,615 --> 00:35:38,779
He's being held on the lsland of San Perot,
only a day's sailing from here.

286
00:35:40,154 --> 00:35:42,281
Who's holding him for us, Skipper?

287
00:35:42,356 --> 00:35:46,918
The King's troop. ln the military prison.
Now, what could be sweeter, lads?

288
00:35:46,994 --> 00:35:50,828
We'll steal him from the King's men,
and sell him back to a king's man.

289
00:35:51,933 --> 00:35:55,767
- But be thou seriously planning to...
- Walk us into a king's prison?

290
00:35:55,837 --> 00:35:58,772
Why, not at all, Humble Bellows, not at all.

291
00:35:59,173 --> 00:36:01,368
Gather round, lads, gather round!

292
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:52,818
- My, my, what a pretty knife.
- Would you like a closer look?

293
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:55,585
Let's keep this pot
looking like a ship of the line!

294
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,720
Come up here.

295
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:04,332
Hop to it!

296
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,979
l came up to talk about El Libre.

297
00:37:20,121 --> 00:37:23,249
- Go ahead. l'm listening.
- You have a plan to save him?

298
00:37:23,858 --> 00:37:26,986
A plan and a price.
Guns alone will cost 50,000.

299
00:37:27,061 --> 00:37:30,963
That's a great deal of money for guns.
How much are you asking for El Libre?

300
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:33,660
Oh, yes, El Libre.

301
00:37:34,435 --> 00:37:36,027
l'll throw him in for nothing.

302
00:37:37,538 --> 00:37:39,062
Very well, Captain.

303
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:41,608
l'll see that the money
is arranged with him.

304
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:44,201
You may be sure
that he'll honor the agreement.

305
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:46,512
What's your plan?

306
00:37:51,218 --> 00:37:53,482
Why did you bolt
your cabin door last night?

307
00:37:53,754 --> 00:37:56,484
lf you know it was bolted,
you must've tried it.

308
00:37:56,624 --> 00:37:59,115
And if you tried it,
you know why it was bolted.

309
00:38:02,163 --> 00:38:04,188
How do you propose to get El Libre?

310
00:38:04,765 --> 00:38:06,756
ls your door open only to him?

311
00:38:08,069 --> 00:38:09,263
What do you mean?

312
00:38:09,337 --> 00:38:12,966
So much concern about one man
can't be entirely political.

313
00:38:13,507 --> 00:38:15,099
He's your lover.

314
00:38:15,609 --> 00:38:16,667
No.

315
00:38:17,411 --> 00:38:18,969
He's my father.

316
00:38:20,748 --> 00:38:22,045
Captain!

317
00:38:26,587 --> 00:38:28,054
Land ho!

318
00:38:44,438 --> 00:38:46,929
On your feet, lads. Attention!

319
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,242
You're supposed to be king's men,
not bard slabs.

320
00:38:55,449 --> 00:38:57,644
Look like you belong in those uniforms.

321
00:39:10,498 --> 00:39:13,729
Ojo, signal to the garrison
that Baron Gruda has arrived...

322
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:15,796
to take El Libre into custody.

323
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:31,475
- What about my father?
- l ordered you to stay below.

324
00:39:33,854 --> 00:39:35,822
What are they signaling?

325
00:39:37,758 --> 00:39:41,250
The garrison commander wishes
to give a dinner in honor of Baron Gruda.

326
00:39:42,196 --> 00:39:44,164
What are we going to do?

327
00:39:45,433 --> 00:39:47,833
We're going to accept, of course.

328
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,538
Baron Gruda and his bit of fluff...

329
00:40:27,608 --> 00:40:30,805
left enough clothes onboard
to fool the King himself.

330
00:40:30,878 --> 00:40:32,470
lf anyone recognizes us...

331
00:40:32,546 --> 00:40:35,709
we'll be stripping for action
and taking El Libre the hard way.

332
00:40:43,557 --> 00:40:46,651
A fine body of men, Captain.
A fine body of men.

333
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:24,220
His Excellency Baron Gruda and party.

334
00:41:40,948 --> 00:41:42,813
Welcome, Your Excellency.

335
00:41:42,883 --> 00:41:46,319
lt is a great honor for all of us
to meet you at last.

336
00:41:46,387 --> 00:41:49,413
lt gives us great pleasure
that you accept our hospitality.

337
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:52,357
On the contrary, my dear Colonel,
it is l who am accepted.

338
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:55,361
Oh, no, Your Excellency.
l am the lucky one.

339
00:41:56,197 --> 00:42:00,634
l had instructions from the Governor
of Cobra to execute El Libre.

340
00:42:01,402 --> 00:42:04,428
l was on the verge of doing so
when l got your message.

341
00:42:04,505 --> 00:42:07,406
The Governor is an idiot!
l may replace him...

342
00:42:08,709 --> 00:42:10,040
with a military man.

343
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:13,804
- My dear Baron.
- My dear Colonel.

344
00:42:19,386 --> 00:42:22,583
- May l introduce you to our guests?
- By all means.

345
00:42:33,734 --> 00:42:36,168
- Your Excellency.
- Your Excellency.

346
00:43:03,197 --> 00:43:06,689
But l have so much trouble
collecting the King's taxes here.

347
00:43:06,767 --> 00:43:09,793
Tell me, Count.
How do the people pay at home?

348
00:43:13,207 --> 00:43:15,971
Through the nose!
They pay through the nose!

349
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:19,509
That's really very good!

350
00:43:23,717 --> 00:43:25,947
How long do we have to play this game?

351
00:43:27,921 --> 00:43:30,515
Till the Colonel decides
to hand over El Libre.

352
00:43:30,591 --> 00:43:32,183
l am frightened.

353
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:59,079
The Count must be
a constant delight to you.

354
00:43:59,153 --> 00:44:01,451
He's really too funny for words.

355
00:44:01,522 --> 00:44:02,716
lndeed he is.

356
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:04,155
Do tell us, Count.

357
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:07,625
What does the Queen wear
when she goes out these days?

358
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:12,799
The Count always says
the Queen wears the King out.

359
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,100
You are the wittiest man!

360
00:44:18,339 --> 00:44:22,002
Ladies and gentlemen,
may l have your attention, please.

361
00:44:23,277 --> 00:44:27,304
To commemorate the honor
Baron Gruda has done us by his visit...

362
00:44:27,781 --> 00:44:32,480
the officers of the Saint Theo garrison
have arranged a little gift for him.

363
00:44:33,721 --> 00:44:36,281
Will everyone come this way, please?

364
00:44:50,971 --> 00:44:52,097
On the left...

365
00:44:52,172 --> 00:44:56,836
you have that great lover of democracy
and the people, El Libre.

366
00:44:57,311 --> 00:45:00,508
And on the right,
that distinguished scientist...

367
00:45:00,581 --> 00:45:02,606
Professor Prudence.

368
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:05,717
Both caught like rats in a trap...

369
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:10,117
conspiring against the greater glory
of His Majesty.

370
00:45:10,891 --> 00:45:14,190
But thanks to statesmen
like Baron Gruda...

371
00:45:14,728 --> 00:45:19,222
such men and such ideas
will soon be destroyed.

372
00:45:20,167 --> 00:45:21,896
As a distinguished scientist...

373
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:26,429
l can assure you an idea has no physical
properties which can be destroyed.

374
00:45:26,507 --> 00:45:29,442
As a lover of democracy and the people,
l can assure you...

375
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:31,910
both will survive your puny efforts.

376
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:36,775
As a statesman, l can assure you
that no one can foretell the future.

377
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:40,411
However, your fate at present
is as clear to me...

378
00:45:41,021 --> 00:45:43,615
as the face of this beautiful lady
at my side.

379
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:45,123
Bravo!

380
00:45:45,192 --> 00:45:47,922
Thank you, Your Excellency.

381
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:55,491
Yes. She is very beautiful.

382
00:45:57,037 --> 00:45:58,902
His Excellency has a point.

383
00:45:58,972 --> 00:46:03,033
lt's foolish to quarrel with fate
when ours is so clearly in his hands.

384
00:46:04,611 --> 00:46:08,604
Take them outside and hold them
for Baron Gruda's pleasure.

385
00:46:13,454 --> 00:46:16,946
My dear Colonel, thank you
for a most rewarding evening.

386
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:20,016
- And now we must go.
- lt is by no means over.

387
00:46:20,127 --> 00:46:22,823
l've arranged
a very special entertainment...

388
00:46:22,896 --> 00:46:24,989
for this very special occasion.

389
00:46:47,588 --> 00:46:49,749
lt's that dame we held for ransom.

390
00:47:00,767 --> 00:47:01,893
Abandon ship.

391
00:47:01,969 --> 00:47:04,995
- Thank you, my dear Colonel.
- Your Excellency!

392
00:47:05,539 --> 00:47:09,134
- But, my dear Baron!
- Wonderful evening, Colonel.

393
00:47:09,209 --> 00:47:10,335
Vallo!

394
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:17,678
But, Your Excellency.

395
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:21,448
Unexpected international affairs.
Happens to us diplomats all the time.

396
00:47:25,726 --> 00:47:28,194
- Put the prisoners in my carriage.
- Aye, aye, sir.

397
00:47:35,869 --> 00:47:38,997
l do hope the King will hear about this,
Your Excellency.

398
00:47:39,072 --> 00:47:40,437
Don't worry, he will.

399
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:44,877
Unclutch me, you polluted shrimp.

400
00:47:47,714 --> 00:47:49,511
Stop him, you fools!

401
00:47:49,917 --> 00:47:52,078
He's the Crimson Pirate!

402
00:47:52,152 --> 00:47:53,881
The Crimson Pirate?

403
00:48:02,029 --> 00:48:04,793
The Crimson Pirate!

404
00:48:06,867 --> 00:48:08,892
Take the Colonel to safety. Quick, man.

405
00:48:10,871 --> 00:48:14,204
- Take the Colonel to safety!
- Let me go, you fools!

406
00:48:15,409 --> 00:48:18,139
Don't worry, Colonel.
l'll take care of everything!

407
00:48:18,211 --> 00:48:21,305
- Citizen Ravel, save the Count!
- Save the Count!

408
00:48:30,357 --> 00:48:32,917
- Sire! Sire!
- Good work, Captain.

409
00:48:33,193 --> 00:48:35,855
Stop him! There's the Crimson Pirate!

410
00:48:36,463 --> 00:48:37,725
Captain!

411
00:48:39,433 --> 00:48:41,663
The officers are mutinying. Crush them!

412
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:44,733
Crush them! Come on!

413
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,705
Sound the attack!

414
00:48:51,378 --> 00:48:54,541
Hold the fort. Don't give an inch.
Protect the women and children.

415
00:48:54,615 --> 00:48:57,584
Reinforcements are on the way.
Lock the gates! Let no one out.

416
00:48:57,651 --> 00:48:59,642
Lock the gates! Let no one out!

417
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:03,019
Long live the King!

418
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:09,922
l don't think we've met.
My name is Prudence.

419
00:49:09,997 --> 00:49:12,227
Captain Vallo, at your service.

420
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:15,699
Thank you.

421
00:49:48,101 --> 00:49:50,092
What are you grinning at?

422
00:49:55,175 --> 00:49:58,269
So, l'm getting a halo.
You're afraid l'm getting soft.

423
00:49:59,112 --> 00:50:00,841
Yeah, you're wrong.

424
00:50:02,482 --> 00:50:06,680
lt's just that this is a new kind of caper.
These people are getting on my nerves.

425
00:50:07,287 --> 00:50:09,653
El Libre and his daughter
are strictly business.

426
00:50:11,291 --> 00:50:14,590
They haven't got me chained.
l've got them chained.

427
00:50:15,295 --> 00:50:17,422
l'll be rid of them soon enough.

428
00:50:17,497 --> 00:50:20,295
Tomorrow, l'm delivering them
to Baron Gruda personally.

429
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:23,330
What are you talking about?

430
00:50:49,262 --> 00:50:50,559
The girl?

431
00:50:55,168 --> 00:50:56,499
What about the girl?

432
00:51:00,574 --> 00:51:02,269
She's getting under my skin.

433
00:51:03,410 --> 00:51:05,469
She's putting crazy ideas in my head.

434
00:51:06,246 --> 00:51:10,410
She's unlocked my heart.
She's getting too close to me.

435
00:51:11,918 --> 00:51:13,351
She's got me hooked.

436
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:16,888
She's blind.

437
00:51:18,058 --> 00:51:20,083
l'm blind. You're blind.

438
00:51:21,027 --> 00:51:22,358
Who's blind?

439
00:51:25,699 --> 00:51:27,360
Oh! Love is blind.

440
00:51:29,236 --> 00:51:30,863
l am not in love!

441
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:19,283
Avast there!

442
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:24,387
l told you not to make so much noise.
Now the Skipper will get her.

443
00:52:24,457 --> 00:52:26,584
- He always does.
- Nobody will get her.

444
00:52:33,867 --> 00:52:35,528
Untie the others. Move!

445
00:52:35,602 --> 00:52:37,399
What's up? l'm having a little fun.

446
00:52:37,470 --> 00:52:40,962
- Come on, Skipper. Let us have some fun.
- You want her all to yourself?

447
00:52:41,041 --> 00:52:44,238
- Why don't you join the fun?
- Why don't you try yourself?

448
00:52:44,311 --> 00:52:47,974
- You always tell that you couldn't make it.
- Always work and no fun.

449
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:04,655
Mr. Bellows, take all three below
and bring me the cabin keys.

450
00:53:04,798 --> 00:53:07,392
lf you'll forgive
my pointing it out, Skipper...

451
00:53:07,467 --> 00:53:10,834
we can't leave a pretty woman
unmolested aboard ship.

452
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:13,569
lt will give piracy a bad name.

453
00:53:13,707 --> 00:53:15,538
Are you challenging my orders?

454
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:19,472
l'd never do that, Skipper...

455
00:53:19,746 --> 00:53:23,705
but seeing thou is selling these pigeons
to Baron Gruda anyway...

456
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:27,583
l thought there could be no harm
to sport with them a bit first.

457
00:53:29,256 --> 00:53:31,019
No offense, Skipper.

458
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:49,135
l'm putting you ashore tomorrow at Cobra
and giving you the guns.

459
00:53:50,243 --> 00:53:51,608
All of you.

460
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:55,076
Just don't thank me.

461
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,348
Skipper.

462
00:54:44,464 --> 00:54:47,627
Yes, there's our ship.
With Baron Gruda waiting.

463
00:54:48,101 --> 00:54:50,035
Won't he hate paying for El Libre...

464
00:54:50,103 --> 00:54:53,834
when he finds out we stole him
out of one of the King's own prisons?

465
00:54:56,943 --> 00:55:00,743
- We'll heave to onto the point till nightfall.
- Aye, aye, Skipper.

466
00:55:05,752 --> 00:55:06,946
Slimey.

467
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:21,329
- Let's see thee swim to yonder island.
- Aye, and back again.

468
00:55:21,801 --> 00:55:25,601
lf my plan works,
Baron Gruda himself will escort thee back.

469
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:28,131
l've a message for thee to give to him.

470
00:55:28,541 --> 00:55:31,203
Do it, and when l am skipper...

471
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:33,140
thou wilt be first mate.

472
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:38,073
Mr. Bellows...

473
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:43,248
- what about sharks?
- They never attack a man.

474
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:46,118
Unless he attacks them first.

475
00:55:56,936 --> 00:55:58,699
- Governor.
- Baron?

476
00:55:59,406 --> 00:56:03,035
- Send him to the kitchen and feed him.
- Kitchen. Feed him.

477
00:56:06,246 --> 00:56:08,771
You'll have the 100,000 gold florin
ready for them.

478
00:56:08,848 --> 00:56:11,112
Whatever Your Excellency orders.

479
00:56:11,184 --> 00:56:14,950
- But this is sheer piracy.
- l assure you...

480
00:56:15,088 --> 00:56:18,751
l shall have El Libre, his daughter,
his distinguished conspirator...

481
00:56:18,825 --> 00:56:23,228
our ship, our guns, the pirates,
and Captain Vallo, without paying a sou.

482
00:56:23,496 --> 00:56:26,659
- Then why 100,000?
- Have the money ready, l said.

483
00:56:28,535 --> 00:56:32,471
The first mate thinks he can undo Vallo,
but his plan may fail.

484
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:36,901
Even if we have to pay, such a haul
would be cheap at double the price.

485
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:38,443
By the way...

486
00:56:38,945 --> 00:56:42,210
l shall want a barrel of this, well drugged.

487
00:56:50,590 --> 00:56:52,683
- You disposed of Captain Vallo?
- No.

488
00:56:52,759 --> 00:56:55,853
lt will be necessary to expose him
to the crew first.

489
00:56:55,929 --> 00:56:59,922
Which l'll be doing soon enough,
if thou has followed my instructions.

490
00:56:59,999 --> 00:57:01,489
To the letter.

491
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:04,736
And the money?
lf you'll forgive my impatience.

492
00:57:04,804 --> 00:57:06,965
lt will be waiting for you in the morning.

493
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:10,305
Meanwhile, l place myself in your hands
as security for it.

494
00:57:10,376 --> 00:57:11,741
Very well.

495
00:57:11,811 --> 00:57:15,406
But l remind thee, they be murderous
hands when they're empty.

496
00:57:17,117 --> 00:57:19,085
Hide His Excellency below.

497
00:57:50,483 --> 00:57:54,419
As soon as it's clear topside,
Ojo will stand by below with a small boat.

498
00:57:54,487 --> 00:57:57,479
lt's a short pull to shore. Call your father.

499
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:33,524
Come with us. Join us.

500
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:36,619
No.

501
00:58:38,464 --> 00:58:41,365
But you want to. l know you want to.

502
00:58:42,535 --> 00:58:44,002
You're wrong.

503
00:58:44,871 --> 00:58:47,863
There's nothing in it for me.
Get your father.

504
00:58:52,645 --> 00:58:54,704
Then why are you setting us free?

505
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:58,182
- l keep my promises, even foolish ones.
- You made no promise.

506
00:58:58,251 --> 00:59:01,345
You made a deal to sell us,
and you can't do it.

507
00:59:01,654 --> 00:59:05,488
All right, then. l'm doing it for you.
Let's leave it at that.

508
00:59:06,492 --> 00:59:09,359
No, Vallo. We can't leave it at that.

509
00:59:10,096 --> 00:59:12,428
You're a fighter. Fight with us.

510
00:59:12,999 --> 00:59:15,433
- Fight for something decent.
- Not l.

511
00:59:16,035 --> 00:59:20,131
All my life l've watched injustice
and dishonesty fly the flag of decency.

512
00:59:20,206 --> 00:59:23,073
- l don't trust them.
- Don't you trust me?

513
00:59:26,112 --> 00:59:29,013
Don't you trust what we have
for each other?

514
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:32,413
What we have for each other
we'll have to get over.

515
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:36,015
Can we?

516
00:59:54,374 --> 00:59:56,774
You're right. l won't let you go.

517
00:59:57,744 --> 01:00:01,578
We belong together here,
aboard my ship. We'll find a way.

518
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:05,249
But that's not possible.

519
01:00:06,486 --> 01:00:10,616
- l can't stay here. Don't you see?
- Yes, l see.

520
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:14,357
And now, at last, you see it, too.

521
01:00:15,228 --> 01:00:18,026
You've got your world, and l've got mine.

522
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:25,166
All right, gentlemen.

523
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:29,970
Sit down.

524
01:00:32,011 --> 01:00:34,878
Professor, you'll go ashore later
with Pablo Murphy and the guns.

525
01:00:34,947 --> 01:00:37,745
- Right.
- Keep talking to yourself, loudly.

526
01:00:37,850 --> 01:00:40,318
l want my men to think
you're all still here.

527
01:00:40,386 --> 01:00:42,377
That's no problem for me.

528
01:00:42,588 --> 01:00:45,318
Now, remember, this is a dangerous game.

529
01:00:45,458 --> 01:00:48,985
lf my men tumble to it,
they'll slit your throats, and mine, too.

530
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:51,030
l don't like it, Captain.

531
01:00:51,497 --> 01:00:54,989
We can't leave you to face them alone.
Come with us.

532
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:57,331
Father...

533
01:00:57,870 --> 01:00:58,894
don't.

534
01:01:45,818 --> 01:01:47,581
Avast! Man the guns!

535
01:01:55,361 --> 01:01:57,090
Topside, you swabs!

536
01:02:11,511 --> 01:02:12,637
Help!

537
01:02:18,251 --> 01:02:21,618
Not so fast, Skipper,
if you'll pardon the intrusion.

538
01:02:42,074 --> 01:02:45,601
You've sold me, Humble Bellows,
and to a king's flunky.

539
01:02:45,678 --> 01:02:46,736
Aye.

540
01:02:47,246 --> 01:02:50,943
'Tis my modest opinion
that no man can fly pirate's colors...

541
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:55,044
who's not willing to sell his friend,
his sweetheart, or his mother.

542
01:02:55,121 --> 01:02:58,113
- Well spoken, Mr. Bellows.
- Foul spoken it is.

543
01:02:58,491 --> 01:03:01,051
You've turned your hand
against your Captain's back.

544
01:03:01,127 --> 01:03:03,220
Yellow was never a pirate's color.

545
01:03:03,329 --> 01:03:06,162
Nor rescuing a fair maiden a pirate caper.

546
01:03:06,966 --> 01:03:08,024
Aye.

547
01:03:08,835 --> 01:03:11,599
lt's true. l sailed beyond my depth...

548
01:03:13,105 --> 01:03:15,972
but only to sound out new waters
for the lot of us.

549
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:20,274
lf we'd have starved to death,
l'd have never sold a man jack of you.

550
01:03:22,648 --> 01:03:26,584
Gather round, lads.
This isn't the last of the pirate capers.

551
01:03:26,652 --> 01:03:29,450
'Tis the last of thee and of thy capers...

552
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:34,189
for 'twas put to the vote whilst thee
was trying to deprive us of our loot.

553
01:03:34,293 --> 01:03:38,320
Ye violated the pirate code
by letting a fat fish off the hook.

554
01:03:39,632 --> 01:03:42,567
By vote of all,
ye are deprived of command...

555
01:03:42,969 --> 01:03:47,235
and sentenced under piratical law
to be cast adrift in a small boat...

556
01:03:47,907 --> 01:03:49,772
without food or water.

557
01:03:52,411 --> 01:03:56,472
A splendid decision, Mr. Bellows.
Quick justice and certain death.

558
01:03:57,316 --> 01:04:01,650
Perhaps you'd save the King the expense
of hanging this learned fool...

559
01:04:01,821 --> 01:04:03,812
and let him keep Captain Vallo company.

560
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:07,218
Thou hast a generous choice.

561
01:04:07,527 --> 01:04:09,427
The gallows or the sea.

562
01:04:17,803 --> 01:04:19,668
lf it won't crowd you.

563
01:04:21,641 --> 01:04:25,270
l'd rather you weren't coming,
but l don't want to seem inhospitable.

564
01:04:27,013 --> 01:04:28,503
As for thee...

565
01:04:29,882 --> 01:04:33,682
since l have no voice to raise against
thy Captain's misdemeanors...

566
01:04:33,753 --> 01:04:37,484
thee will be pardoned by giving thy hand
to thy new skipper.

567
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:41,089
What say thee? Shall we loose thy bonds?

568
01:04:52,772 --> 01:04:54,262
Cut him loose.

569
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:32,910
lt's done, Skipper. We set them adrift.

570
01:05:33,412 --> 01:05:36,245
The morning tide
will take them out to sea.

571
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:49,624
Wait! This calls for a celebration,
eh, Mr. Bellows?

572
01:05:50,029 --> 01:05:54,022
l've a keg of rum aboard my boat.
Straight from the Governor's own cellar.

573
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:55,362
What say?

574
01:05:56,969 --> 01:05:58,027
Aye.

575
01:05:58,437 --> 01:05:59,927
l could use a drink.

576
01:06:00,339 --> 01:06:02,773
Come on, lads! Get the rum aboard.

577
01:06:06,245 --> 01:06:08,679
Bring mine to the Captain's cabin.

578
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:17,712
There's the end of land.
The end of our world.

579
01:06:17,857 --> 01:06:20,587
From now on, it's starve, thirst,
and finally capsize.

580
01:06:21,193 --> 01:06:23,627
l've been meditating on just that.

581
01:06:24,030 --> 01:06:28,194
Capsizing is the solution of our problem.
There's no doubt about it.

582
01:06:29,368 --> 01:06:32,030
- lf you'll follow me, please.
- Sit down, you fool!

583
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:36,875
Sit down, you...

584
01:07:08,574 --> 01:07:09,836
lt works.

585
01:07:11,544 --> 01:07:13,273
Good old Aristotle.

586
01:07:13,345 --> 01:07:15,711
Over 2,000 years ago, he wrote:

587
01:07:15,781 --> 01:07:19,649
"A metallic vessel will retain air
underwater without filling."

588
01:07:19,719 --> 01:07:22,415
But l myself have done some research
on the subject...

589
01:07:22,488 --> 01:07:25,924
while designing a craft
which l call an undersea boat.

590
01:07:25,991 --> 01:07:29,825
- How did you know this was airtight?
- ln science, my son...

591
01:07:30,396 --> 01:07:33,126
one knows nothing until one experiments.

592
01:07:34,366 --> 01:07:37,199
We may now conclude
that we are breathing.

593
01:07:37,369 --> 01:07:39,837
Let us walk ashore as quickly as possible.

594
01:07:39,905 --> 01:07:43,397
l compute there's sufficient air
to last us several minutes.

595
01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:46,377
Providing we don't waste
our oxygen talking, of course.

596
01:07:46,445 --> 01:07:48,970
- All right, then. Shut up!
- Quite so.

597
01:09:56,675 --> 01:10:00,736
You needn't have brought out
the whole garrison. l did the job myself.

598
01:10:00,813 --> 01:10:03,543
They won't be so playful
when they wake up this time.

599
01:10:03,616 --> 01:10:05,584
All right. Wake them up.

600
01:10:05,851 --> 01:10:08,046
Sober them up
and take them to the pirate ship.

601
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:09,883
Over the side with them!

602
01:10:38,717 --> 01:10:41,686
Sorry l be for this, mates.
And l humbly apologize.

603
01:10:41,754 --> 01:10:44,552
'Twould never have happened
with Vallo as skipper.

604
01:10:44,857 --> 01:10:47,849
He violated a pirate code
and he had to go.

605
01:10:48,260 --> 01:10:51,525
But he went like a pirate.
We're going like fish.

606
01:10:51,597 --> 01:10:54,259
l can't forgive myself for that.

607
01:10:55,567 --> 01:10:58,832
King's flunky made a monkey
of Humble Bellows.

608
01:10:59,204 --> 01:11:02,037
- Pirate of the old school.
- Enough of that!

609
01:11:02,107 --> 01:11:03,472
Hoist them!

610
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:12,177
Put a crew aboard this ship
and have her re-canvased.

611
01:11:12,251 --> 01:11:14,879
l want her ready to sail when l leave.

612
01:11:15,154 --> 01:11:18,715
Give them just enough bread
and water to keep them alive.

613
01:11:18,791 --> 01:11:21,624
They'll fetch a good bounty from the King.

614
01:11:56,695 --> 01:11:58,424
Ahoy. Pablo Murphy.

615
01:12:00,065 --> 01:12:02,465
- Well, l'll be...
- Get us out of these chains.

616
01:12:02,534 --> 01:12:05,731
After all you got us into,
you lying blabbermouth?

617
01:12:05,804 --> 01:12:07,704
Get yourself out of it.

618
01:12:20,519 --> 01:12:23,716
- Pablo Murphy.
- For the last time, get away from us.

619
01:12:24,223 --> 01:12:26,817
Get it through that head of yours,
l didn't sell El Libre.

620
01:12:26,892 --> 01:12:29,759
- Let me assure...
- We can see for ourselves what he's done.

621
01:12:29,828 --> 01:12:32,558
lf we'd gone my way,
El Libre wouldn't be dead.

622
01:12:32,631 --> 01:12:34,895
Consuelo wouldn't be held captive
in the palace...

623
01:12:34,967 --> 01:12:37,936
and we'd have guns to stop Gruda's men
from crushing us.

624
01:12:38,003 --> 01:12:40,198
Hold it, gentlemen. Soldiers.

625
01:12:49,314 --> 01:12:53,683
By order of Baron Gruda, all fishing
will be done under armed escort.

626
01:12:53,919 --> 01:12:56,319
The entire catch to be turned over
to the Governor.

627
01:12:56,388 --> 01:12:58,618
- What'll be left for us?
- The bait.

628
01:12:58,957 --> 01:13:00,822
ln that case, we'll do no fishing.

629
01:13:02,995 --> 01:13:04,758
Any more objections?

630
01:13:05,964 --> 01:13:09,092
The rest of you proceed
to the Governor's dock. Get moving!

631
01:13:10,536 --> 01:13:12,527
Take him to the fortress.

632
01:13:27,386 --> 01:13:28,648
This way.

633
01:14:11,296 --> 01:14:14,356
- Hey, there, back in line.
- Follow those boats.

634
01:14:49,034 --> 01:14:50,399
After them!

635
01:16:12,184 --> 01:16:13,446
Let's go.

636
01:16:45,917 --> 01:16:49,182
- ls everything arranged?
- Just as you ordered, Excellency.

637
01:16:49,254 --> 01:16:52,746
You've broken the back of the rebellion
overnight. The King owes you much.

638
01:16:52,824 --> 01:16:56,954
He will pay it. l may even be able to collect
the full bounty on Captain Vallo...

639
01:16:57,029 --> 01:17:00,931
for he was killed by his own men
while trying to save El Libre.

640
01:17:05,070 --> 01:17:07,038
Don't be upset, my dear.

641
01:17:07,406 --> 01:17:11,103
You'll form new attachments here.
You're to marry the Governor.

642
01:17:11,176 --> 01:17:13,940
After l'm gone,
you'll rule through her, Governor.

643
01:17:14,012 --> 01:17:17,175
You'll order your people to till their fields
and fish their seas...

644
01:17:17,249 --> 01:17:19,046
for the greater glory of the King.

645
01:17:19,117 --> 01:17:21,847
- l'd die first.
- No, you'll die last.

646
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:25,212
First you'll watch your people go
one by one.

647
01:17:43,775 --> 01:17:45,640
Someday l'll kill you.

648
01:17:47,245 --> 01:17:48,473
Officer!

649
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:56,779
These methods will bring her round soon.

650
01:17:56,855 --> 01:17:59,619
l shouldn't like her to kill herself
before she marries.

651
01:17:59,691 --> 01:18:03,718
She's not the type. She'll marry you
and wait for a chance to poison you.

652
01:18:03,795 --> 01:18:07,253
lt doesn't sound like an ideal marriage.
Couldn't we dispense with that?

653
01:18:07,332 --> 01:18:09,630
Too much of it upsets my liver.

654
01:18:11,603 --> 01:18:15,437
lt's not your liver. lt's your heart.
lt's much too soft.

655
01:18:18,710 --> 01:18:21,144
Tonight the people bury El Libre.

656
01:18:21,413 --> 01:18:24,746
l want a proclamation posted
in the path of the funeral procession...

657
01:18:24,816 --> 01:18:27,376
announcing your marriage
to the daughter of El Libre.

658
01:18:27,452 --> 01:18:28,783
Excellency!

659
01:18:29,488 --> 01:18:33,185
People will be required to attend
and provide entertainment...

660
01:18:33,358 --> 01:18:35,121
to make it a day of rejoicing.

661
01:18:35,193 --> 01:18:37,491
We'll have them fill
the royal grain warehouse...

662
01:18:37,562 --> 01:18:39,894
with 10,000 sacks of grain as a present.

663
01:18:40,399 --> 01:18:42,196
You're learning fast.

664
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:46,862
After the ceremony, l'll leave you
my troops and my blessings, and depart.

665
01:18:48,707 --> 01:18:53,201
Except for the late, lamented Vallo,
this has been a most boring assignment.

666
01:19:03,955 --> 01:19:07,618
On your way, pig! Amnesty
has been declared for all prisoners.

667
01:19:07,692 --> 01:19:11,253
Baron Gruda will give you a chance
to show allegiance at the wedding.

668
01:19:12,397 --> 01:19:13,591
Gruda.

669
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:17,860
Gruda, someday l'll kill you.

670
01:19:18,870 --> 01:19:20,360
l'll kill you!

671
01:19:22,541 --> 01:19:26,102
- So it's a marriage now, is it?
- Consuelo will never do it.

672
01:19:26,178 --> 01:19:29,011
Look! 10,000 sacks of grain
for the Governor.

673
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:30,342
Not mine!

674
01:19:30,749 --> 01:19:32,683
So we're to rejoice, are we?

675
01:19:46,631 --> 01:19:49,725
Baron Gruda has made
the defacing of public property...

676
01:19:49,801 --> 01:19:52,065
an offense punishable by death...

677
01:19:52,137 --> 01:19:54,970
both for the culprit and the accomplices.

678
01:19:55,307 --> 01:19:57,639
Sergeant, round up these people.

679
01:20:27,105 --> 01:20:30,404
- What are you going to do about it?
- lt's no concern of mine.

680
01:20:38,950 --> 01:20:42,249
- What are you going to do about her?
- Get her out of it, somehow.

681
01:20:42,687 --> 01:20:45,087
Alone, against 1,000 troops?

682
01:20:45,657 --> 01:20:47,852
- There must be a way.
- There is.

683
01:20:47,926 --> 01:20:51,020
lt's a question of simple logic.
We need allies.

684
01:20:51,429 --> 01:20:54,057
These people need freedom.
Let's help them get it.

685
01:20:54,132 --> 01:20:56,657
The only freedom
l'm interested in is Consuelo's.

686
01:20:56,735 --> 01:20:59,932
She'll never consent to be free
until her people are free.

687
01:21:00,005 --> 01:21:01,370
lmpossible.

688
01:21:01,973 --> 01:21:04,635
They don't have a chance
against Gruda's crack troops.

689
01:21:04,709 --> 01:21:07,769
Science has learned
that nothing is impossible.

690
01:21:07,846 --> 01:21:11,748
Not long ago, l saw a ship
sailing through the skies of France...

691
01:21:11,816 --> 01:21:15,980
supported by a great bag filled with air
that was lighter than air.

692
01:21:16,621 --> 01:21:20,853
A friend of mine has invented a liquid
that can blast away mountains.

693
01:21:21,293 --> 01:21:25,525
l have completed plans for a boat
that can sail underneath the water.

694
01:21:26,197 --> 01:21:27,926
Who knows what we may accomplish...

695
01:21:27,999 --> 01:21:31,162
against the outdated Baron Gruda
and his outdated world?

696
01:21:31,236 --> 01:21:33,500
All we need is the help of these people...

697
01:21:33,605 --> 01:21:38,474
a little imagination, and deft fingers
with which to steal a few basic materials.

698
01:22:04,636 --> 01:22:06,399
The Baron thinks we're finished.

699
01:22:06,471 --> 01:22:09,031
We're going to let him go on thinking so.

700
01:22:09,107 --> 01:22:11,837
We'll fill the royal grain warehouse
as ordered.

701
01:22:11,910 --> 01:22:14,208
But with the seeds
of the Professor's genius.

702
01:22:14,279 --> 01:22:17,578
- l beg your pardon?
- The Baron has the most weapons.

703
01:22:17,649 --> 01:22:19,139
But we'll have the newest.

704
01:22:19,217 --> 01:22:22,414
An explosive that moves mountains.
A ship that flies through the air.

705
01:22:22,487 --> 01:22:26,287
A ship that flies through the air
by next Sunday? lmpossible.

706
01:22:26,825 --> 01:22:28,656
A great man once said to me:

707
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:31,251
"Science has learned
that nothing is impossible."

708
01:22:34,633 --> 01:22:36,863
Gather round, lads and lasses.

709
01:22:37,335 --> 01:22:41,738
We'll show your fighters and workers
new ways to get rid of old enemies.

710
01:23:35,326 --> 01:23:37,226
lt doesn't smell right.

711
01:23:38,830 --> 01:23:41,560
10,000 sacks of grain have been brought
into the warehouse.

712
01:23:41,633 --> 01:23:43,726
The tunnel to smuggle them out
is complete.

713
01:23:43,802 --> 01:23:47,169
The island is making headway
with the modern weapons to smuggle in...

714
01:23:47,238 --> 01:23:49,502
and still you stand and stir...

715
01:23:49,574 --> 01:23:51,542
that stew with no result.

716
01:23:51,609 --> 01:23:54,407
My friend sent me no formula to go on...

717
01:23:54,479 --> 01:23:58,074
simply the ingredients.
Principally nitrogen and glycerin.

718
01:23:58,149 --> 01:24:00,674
Anyway, l'm not really sure
l want to discover it.

719
01:24:00,752 --> 01:24:04,483
lf it can remove a mountain,
how do l know it won't remove an island?

720
01:24:04,556 --> 01:24:07,650
"ln science, one knows nothing
unless one experiments."

721
01:24:07,726 --> 01:24:09,921
l wish you'd stop quoting me.

722
01:24:16,868 --> 01:24:18,665
That's it.

723
01:24:26,544 --> 01:24:27,806
Soldiers!

724
01:24:31,015 --> 01:24:33,040
Don't fall down with that.

725
01:24:33,284 --> 01:24:35,184
Even if they shoot you.

726
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:08,251
Be careful you don't over-inflate this
in the morning.

727
01:25:08,586 --> 01:25:11,077
We've cut the wall braces
to the breaking point.

728
01:25:11,156 --> 01:25:14,387
But we don't want them to collapse
before the signal.

729
01:25:14,459 --> 01:25:15,585
Remember...

730
01:25:15,660 --> 01:25:19,619
there'll be no signal given till Consuelo's
gotten safely away from Baron Gruda.

731
01:25:26,337 --> 01:25:27,565
Careful.

732
01:25:34,412 --> 01:25:36,209
The liquid explosive.

733
01:25:37,849 --> 01:25:41,546
- ls that all that's left?
- l've improved a bit on the formula.

734
01:25:41,619 --> 01:25:44,110
This is concentrated 1,000 times.

735
01:25:54,632 --> 01:25:55,860
Please.

736
01:26:36,374 --> 01:26:40,003
The royal grain warehouse is reported
full to capacity, Your Excellency.

737
01:26:40,078 --> 01:26:42,979
Amazing how you brought them
to their knees.

738
01:26:43,047 --> 01:26:47,381
Spare the rod and spoil the child.
Never forget that, my dear Governor.

739
01:26:48,052 --> 01:26:50,213
Let's get on with the wedding ceremony.

740
01:26:52,924 --> 01:26:57,623
First, a floral offering for the bride
from the unmarried girls of the island.

741
01:26:57,695 --> 01:27:00,220
A local custom for celebrating weddings.

742
01:27:00,298 --> 01:27:02,095
- Proceed.
- Music.

743
01:27:38,369 --> 01:27:40,701
Watch it. Your beard is showing.

744
01:27:41,339 --> 01:27:42,704
Here we go.

745
01:27:48,146 --> 01:27:50,808
These peasant shapes are not to my taste.

746
01:28:02,961 --> 01:28:04,326
Death to Gruda!

747
01:28:16,140 --> 01:28:17,471
Kill them!

748
01:28:48,439 --> 01:28:50,532
Port side battery. Fire!

749
01:28:59,150 --> 01:29:01,380
No, l mean left. Left!

750
01:29:01,452 --> 01:29:03,750
No. Right. No, left a bit.

751
01:29:05,256 --> 01:29:06,848
What's the matter with you?

752
01:29:06,924 --> 01:29:09,051
Don't you know where you're going?

753
01:29:34,619 --> 01:29:35,711
Fire!

754
01:29:46,664 --> 01:29:48,393
We're going after the girl.

755
01:30:18,830 --> 01:30:20,229
Let's strip for action.

756
01:30:28,306 --> 01:30:29,398
Halt!

757
01:30:32,410 --> 01:30:35,208
We'll cut her to pieces. Man your cannons.

758
01:30:36,647 --> 01:30:37,841
Come on, now.

759
01:30:46,157 --> 01:30:48,182
The high explosive. Quick.

760
01:31:25,696 --> 01:31:28,130
- Get underway!
- Aye, aye, sir.

761
01:31:30,601 --> 01:31:32,193
Man the capstan!

762
01:31:37,141 --> 01:31:38,631
Get her below.

763
01:31:40,311 --> 01:31:42,506
Don't waste time. Slit the cable!

764
01:31:47,084 --> 01:31:50,144
We've got to gain altitude.
Unload the ballast.

765
01:31:58,162 --> 01:31:59,993
Come on. Get rid of something.

766
01:32:10,975 --> 01:32:13,671
- What is it?
- lt is the wrath of heaven!

767
01:32:13,744 --> 01:32:15,678
lt has destroyed the fortress!

768
01:32:18,015 --> 01:32:20,711
Our ship and our lads.
We're heading straight for them.

769
01:32:22,119 --> 01:32:23,609
Make it close.

770
01:32:25,856 --> 01:32:27,323
But not too close.

771
01:32:27,391 --> 01:32:30,588
We'll need our ship and our lads
to catch Gruda.

772
01:32:36,133 --> 01:32:38,624
They're going to blow us up!
Jump for your lives!

773
01:33:12,737 --> 01:33:15,001
- lt's our own skipper!
- We knew you'd come.

774
01:33:15,072 --> 01:33:17,165
Get us off this ship.

775
01:33:17,241 --> 01:33:19,937
- Cut the rope down.
- Get us out of here!

776
01:33:36,594 --> 01:33:39,620
Pack out all canvas,
you fairy-tale sea snakes!

777
01:33:39,697 --> 01:33:41,062
Go get 'em!

778
01:33:46,404 --> 01:33:47,666
Move them!

779
01:33:47,905 --> 01:33:48,894
Move!

780
01:34:18,469 --> 01:34:21,563
l really think he plans to do battle with us.

781
01:34:24,375 --> 01:34:27,173
Captain Vallo's lost his head
as well as his heart.

782
01:34:41,859 --> 01:34:43,121
Haul that jib.

783
01:34:46,197 --> 01:34:48,097
Trim those top gallows.

784
01:34:48,899 --> 01:34:50,423
Two points starboard.

785
01:35:02,947 --> 01:35:05,040
Hold your fire for a broadside.

786
01:35:05,116 --> 01:35:07,243
Shall we fire?

787
01:35:07,318 --> 01:35:10,981
There'll be no firing with the girl
on the ship. We're going to board her.

788
01:35:20,164 --> 01:35:22,291
Below decks, the lot of you.

789
01:35:22,433 --> 01:35:23,923
On the double.

790
01:35:31,809 --> 01:35:33,572
Coming, Mr. Bellows?

791
01:35:35,479 --> 01:35:38,175
The fools are going
to trade broadsides with us.

792
01:35:45,523 --> 01:35:46,854
ln you go.

793
01:35:50,628 --> 01:35:53,461
With nobody at the wheel to steer,
we'll not get alongside.

794
01:35:53,531 --> 01:35:56,398
Too late to worry about it.
We'll have to take our chances.

795
01:35:56,467 --> 01:35:58,492
As ye wish. We'll go.

796
01:36:05,509 --> 01:36:07,374
My humble apologies.

797
01:36:07,445 --> 01:36:10,642
But if l can't live like a pirate,
l'll die like one.

798
01:36:10,714 --> 01:36:13,547
l'll stand by the wheel
and bring her alongside.

799
01:36:13,617 --> 01:36:16,085
Skipper! Do them the dirty!

800
01:37:07,037 --> 01:37:08,664
Stand by to fire!

801
01:37:18,816 --> 01:37:19,714
Fire!

802
01:41:12,382 --> 01:41:14,373
We're lost! Get the girl!

803
01:43:42,165 --> 01:43:44,497
Hold it, Professor! We've won!

804
01:43:44,768 --> 01:43:46,633
Get rid of that stuff.

805
01:44:25,776 --> 01:44:26,765
English
