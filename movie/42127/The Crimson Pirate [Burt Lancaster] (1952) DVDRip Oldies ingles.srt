1
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,655
Man the yards! Quick on all canvas!

2
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,586
Gather round, lads and lasses.
Gather round.

3
00:00:22,752 --> 00:00:26,048
You've been shanghaied aboard
for the last cruise of the Crimson Pirate...

4
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:28,763
a long, long time ago
in the far, far Caribbean.

5
00:00:28,864 --> 00:00:32,476
Remember, in a pirate ship,
in pirate waters, in a pirate world...

6
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,546
ask no questions.
Believe only what you see.

7
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,570
No. Believe half of what you see.

8
00:00:46,368 --> 00:00:48,888
Man the capstan! Up anchor!

9
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:51,230
Move, you lubbers!

10
00:02:15,455 --> 00:02:16,797
Ship to starboard!

11
00:02:28,895 --> 00:02:29,975
Attention!

12
00:02:42,143 --> 00:02:44,347
A scurvy ship, Your Excellency.

13
00:02:45,023 --> 00:02:48,798
You can tell by the position of the limbs.
Scurvy's killed the whole crew.

14
00:02:53,535 --> 00:02:56,055
A trim little ship, Captain Rodríguez.

15
00:02:56,415 --> 00:02:59,349
We'll take her in tow.
She'll bring a tidy sum.

16
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,508
Put an officer and two men aboard her,
and have her in tow by nightfall.

17
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:04,793
Aye, aye, sir.

18
00:04:01,983 --> 00:04:05,082
- Only evil can come from a death ship.
- Aye.

19
00:04:05,726 --> 00:04:07,668
Sanctus, one of them touched me!

20
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,708
What happened to those two?

21
00:04:11,423 --> 00:04:12,633
Follow me.

22
00:04:46,974 --> 00:04:49,309
My humble apologies.

23
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,284
Bored?

24
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:51,797
lf only there was something
to break the monotony of this voyage.

25
00:06:52,894 --> 00:06:54,617
Hands aloft, please.

26
00:07:01,469 --> 00:07:04,186
You're the prisoners of Captain Vallo
and his scurvy crew.

27
00:07:21,021 --> 00:07:23,061
You may be overconfident, Captain Vallo.

28
00:07:23,133 --> 00:07:25,653
Two hundred of the King's marines
are aboard this vessel.

29
00:07:25,725 --> 00:07:28,660
And only 20 pirates.
That puts the odds slightly in my favor.

30
00:07:28,734 --> 00:07:31,800
- Better surrender the ship.
- l am merely a passenger.

31
00:07:32,414 --> 00:07:34,236
- Who is he?
- Baron Gruda.

32
00:07:34,301 --> 00:07:36,440
Special envoy to His Majesty.

33
00:07:38,078 --> 00:07:40,761
Well, this is a pleasure.

34
00:07:41,149 --> 00:07:44,378
- You hanged most of my friends.
- For murdering most of mine.

35
00:07:48,381 --> 00:07:50,934
Seems you have
only 199 marines now, Baron.

36
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:55,770
198. Better persuade the Captain
to surrender.

37
00:07:55,901 --> 00:07:57,592
The Captain is not the type to...

38
00:07:59,261 --> 00:08:00,722
197.

39
00:08:00,797 --> 00:08:03,764
However, if you'll permit me
to speak to him...

40
00:08:07,261 --> 00:08:09,268
Ojo, pass the word for the Captain.

41
00:08:15,645 --> 00:08:18,263
Bring down the Captain!

42
00:08:19,005 --> 00:08:21,144
Send down the Captain!

43
00:08:21,661 --> 00:08:23,570
Save the Captain!

44
00:08:23,645 --> 00:08:25,587
Send down the Captain!

45
00:08:29,469 --> 00:08:31,641
Did you ask for the Captain, sir?

46
00:08:31,709 --> 00:08:34,491
Aye. Pay him my compliments
and show him in.

47
00:09:02,972 --> 00:09:04,914
Gather round, lads. Gather round.

48
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,388
We're in luck.

49
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,210
All hands will soon be digging into
a fat divvy.

50
00:09:14,556 --> 00:09:17,655
We're heading for the biggest
and the best pirate days ever.

51
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,506
And here's the rich tally in round numbers.

52
00:09:21,501 --> 00:09:23,094
"Muskets: 3,000.

53
00:09:23,837 --> 00:09:25,747
"Powder kegs: 1,500.

54
00:09:26,397 --> 00:09:29,266
"Rounds of musket shot: 65,000.

55
00:09:29,981 --> 00:09:33,526
- "Rounds of cannon shot..."
- Begging thy pardon for interrupting...

56
00:09:33,917 --> 00:09:36,022
but when will thee get into the gold?

57
00:09:39,389 --> 00:09:40,949
Listen, fellows, listen.

58
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:44,566
There are islands in these waters
steaming with rebellion against the King...

59
00:09:44,637 --> 00:09:47,571
and kept from boiling over
only for lack of guns.

60
00:09:47,644 --> 00:09:50,295
lslands where guns
are worth more than gold.

61
00:09:50,364 --> 00:09:52,568
- More than diamonds.
- Gunrunning?

62
00:09:52,637 --> 00:09:55,703
But that's not piracy, Skipper.
That's business.

63
00:09:55,772 --> 00:09:59,350
- That means working ashore.
- We're doing poorly enough afloat.

64
00:09:59,868 --> 00:10:03,184
lf we're going to try this new caper,
let's make it a good one.

65
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:07,962
This cargo will bring 50,000 gold florin
from any rebels worth the name.

66
00:10:08,028 --> 00:10:11,324
- 50,000 florin?
- That's a pretty good take.

67
00:10:11,388 --> 00:10:13,624
Let's put it to the vote. All those in favor...

68
00:10:13,693 --> 00:10:16,343
lf you'll forgive my interrupting, Skipper...

69
00:10:16,412 --> 00:10:18,900
l'd like to think before l vote.

70
00:10:19,261 --> 00:10:22,425
Meantime, we got
regular pirate business to settle.

71
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:26,107
We got the plank, the culprit,
and the verdict.

72
00:10:26,172 --> 00:10:29,685
All we need's a trial
and execution of a sentence.

73
00:10:29,756 --> 00:10:30,934
He's guilty!

74
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,977
So much for the trial. Now for execution.

75
00:10:34,973 --> 00:10:36,860
Come on. Kill me, you fools.

76
00:10:36,924 --> 00:10:41,179
The King's Navy will scour the Seven Seas
till every one of you is hung high and dry.

77
00:10:41,244 --> 00:10:44,026
- To the plank with him!
- Avast!

78
00:10:51,868 --> 00:10:53,755
There'll be no plank-walking for him.

79
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,122
Forgive my slow-wittedness, Skipper...

80
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:59,963
but are thee asking us to spare
this sweet-smelling toad?

81
00:11:00,572 --> 00:11:02,841
Begging Thy Excellency's pardon.

82
00:11:02,908 --> 00:11:05,942
Your captain's got more brains
than all of you put together.

83
00:11:06,012 --> 00:11:08,117
No doubt you intend
to hold me for ransom.

84
00:11:08,188 --> 00:11:11,537
No, my fine-feathered friend.
l'm setting you free.

85
00:11:12,508 --> 00:11:16,021
l say, if there's no profit in the monkey
we'll have our pleasure.

86
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,099
l say there is profit in him. Alive.

87
00:11:18,172 --> 00:11:20,409
- How much profit?
- Now hear me out.

88
00:11:22,684 --> 00:11:25,815
l said 50,000 gold florin
from the rebels for the guns...

89
00:11:25,884 --> 00:11:29,845
and here, by special commission,
is the King's chief rebel-catcher.

90
00:11:30,428 --> 00:11:33,111
So why not another 50,000
from him and his king...

91
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,831
for telling them which rebels
we sell all the guns to.

92
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,980
Eh, Baron?

93
00:11:37,052 --> 00:11:39,703
A brilliant scheme, Captain.
My congratulations.

94
00:11:39,772 --> 00:11:41,462
Thy congratulations.

95
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:45,531
lf thou art for it,
it is not for the good of pirates.

96
00:11:45,596 --> 00:11:47,505
Good? Gentlemen, it's magnificent.

97
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:52,087
l'm bound for the lsland of Cobra to catch
a man, El Libre, and smash his rebellion.

98
00:11:52,347 --> 00:11:56,276
lf you'll take the guns there, lure him
out of his hole and into my hands...

99
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:58,769
l'll raise the purse another 50,000.

100
00:11:59,644 --> 00:12:03,572
There it is, lads, in round figures:
150,000 florin.

101
00:12:06,716 --> 00:12:09,334
What do you say now,
Mr. Humble Bellows?

102
00:12:09,883 --> 00:12:12,600
Thy humble servant will believe it...

103
00:12:12,668 --> 00:12:14,871
when thy humble servant sees it.

104
00:12:15,643 --> 00:12:17,945
l take it we have a deal, Captain.

105
00:12:48,571 --> 00:12:51,386
This change of ship, Captain,
most uncomfortable.

106
00:12:51,515 --> 00:12:54,614
My men won't transfer cargo.
Too much like honest work.

107
00:12:54,683 --> 00:12:58,032
Captain Vallo, your men have only left me
headsail and topsail.

108
00:12:58,108 --> 00:13:00,661
They're enough to get you to Cobra
sooner or later.

109
00:13:00,731 --> 00:13:02,804
My ship is faster than this barge.

110
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:06,388
l don't want you making port
before l've got El Libre ready for delivery...

111
00:13:06,459 --> 00:13:08,433
or putting a shot in my backside.

112
00:13:08,507 --> 00:13:11,803
l hope El Libre is not as careful
as you are, Captain.

113
00:13:23,067 --> 00:13:24,977
Cast off helm!

114
00:13:26,811 --> 00:13:28,884
Cast off stern!

115
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:34,804
- Mr. Bellows, make sail!
- Aye, aye, sir!

116
00:13:59,002 --> 00:14:00,726
Haul up, full and by.

117
00:14:01,178 --> 00:14:04,594
Nor' nor' east.
We're heading for the lsle of Cobra.

118
00:14:05,147 --> 00:14:07,122
Come on, you lubbers, move!

119
00:14:41,979 --> 00:14:44,728
Hear ye, hear ye!

120
00:14:44,986 --> 00:14:48,020
The King's vessel is now at anchor...

121
00:14:48,091 --> 00:14:51,407
in the port of Cobra
with Baron Gruda aboard.

122
00:14:51,483 --> 00:14:56,087
Any demonstration
will be regarded as high treason.

123
00:14:57,915 --> 00:14:59,955
The people seem very quiet, don't they?

124
00:15:00,027 --> 00:15:03,409
l don't think they intend to demonstrate
against Baron Gruda after all.

125
00:15:03,482 --> 00:15:06,068
- Apparently not, Governor.
- What a pity.

126
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:08,626
Our troops could've cut them down
like wheat.

127
00:15:09,019 --> 00:15:11,320
Couldn't we shoot a few
on general principles?

128
00:15:11,387 --> 00:15:12,728
Might impress the Baron.

129
00:15:12,794 --> 00:15:15,064
He might feel
you are merely provoking trouble.

130
00:15:15,131 --> 00:15:18,262
Most exasperating.
Fire the salute to Baron Gruda.

131
00:15:20,922 --> 00:15:22,231
Attention!

132
00:15:34,298 --> 00:15:38,357
Give the word and l'll dose
those backstabbers with a broadside.

133
00:15:38,683 --> 00:15:40,919
They're not firing at us,
you powder-brained ape.

134
00:15:40,986 --> 00:15:45,012
They're giving us a 15-gun salute.
We're flying the flag of Gruda.

135
00:15:45,082 --> 00:15:48,148
Slimey, bring out the flags
and run up that message l gave you.

136
00:15:48,922 --> 00:15:51,475
And, Slimey,
give the Governor my compliments.

137
00:15:51,546 --> 00:15:53,008
The Crimson Pirate's?

138
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,471
No, you oyster-head, Baron Gruda's.

139
00:15:56,186 --> 00:15:59,666
Mr. Bellows, keep the rest of these
half-masted monkeys below deck.

140
00:15:59,738 --> 00:16:00,982
Aye, aye, Skipper.

141
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:03,985
Keep a sharp lookout, lads.
l'll be back with El Libre tonight.

142
00:16:04,058 --> 00:16:05,519
Let's go, Ojo.

143
00:16:12,442 --> 00:16:16,565
There goes a good pirate,
to sell his wares like a fish peddler.

144
00:16:17,082 --> 00:16:19,471
Meaning no disrespect to the Skipper,
of course.

145
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:21,270
Us with a price on our heads...

146
00:16:21,338 --> 00:16:25,396
holed, too, in one of His Majesty's ports
like sitting ducks.

147
00:16:26,106 --> 00:16:30,329
But if the Skipper pulls us through again,
we'd be the ducks with the golden eggs.

148
00:16:30,394 --> 00:16:33,743
You're thinking of geese,
if you'll pardon the correction, Poison Paul.

149
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:36,952
Geese on a wild-goose chase.

150
00:16:47,834 --> 00:16:49,241
What do they say, Joseph?

151
00:16:49,306 --> 00:16:52,502
They've got the plague onboard,
and they're quarantining themselves...

152
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,544
until the victims are killed or cured.

153
00:16:55,897 --> 00:16:58,581
We must signal my profound condolences
to Baron Gruda.

154
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:01,399
- Very well, Governor.
- Maybe it's all for the best, Joseph.

155
00:17:01,466 --> 00:17:03,735
El Libre's followers
may yet show their hands...

156
00:17:03,802 --> 00:17:06,519
and give me a chance to impress
the Baron. Order my carriage.

157
00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:10,738
Disperse the crowd. Change the guard,
and double your patrols in the street.

158
00:17:11,961 --> 00:17:13,816
Come on, my popsy-wopsy-wopsies.

159
00:17:24,282 --> 00:17:28,177
Plague, is it? May it take all of them.
Baron Gruda first.

160
00:17:28,601 --> 00:17:31,122
Aye, and if the plague don't, we will.

161
00:17:33,657 --> 00:17:36,113
- Who are you?
- Simple fisher folk like yourselves.

162
00:17:36,186 --> 00:17:40,015
Put in for a tankard of ale, a friendly word,
and a chance to fight the King.

163
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:44,239
Why choose us?

164
00:17:48,826 --> 00:17:50,549
You look and talk like a fighter.

165
00:17:51,002 --> 00:17:52,376
lt takes one to know one.

166
00:17:52,441 --> 00:17:55,059
You may have us marked, all right.
Maybe not.

167
00:17:55,129 --> 00:17:57,039
But we haven't marked you yet.

168
00:17:57,114 --> 00:17:59,448
- We're asking no questions.
- We are.

169
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:02,833
What l've heard about El Libre
is good enough for me.

170
00:18:02,905 --> 00:18:04,367
Tell us how to contact him.

171
00:18:04,442 --> 00:18:07,857
A man like him would be pleased to have
two more strong-armed lads aboard.

172
00:18:14,873 --> 00:18:16,760
Not very trusting souls, are they?

173
00:18:28,025 --> 00:18:31,156
l guess we'll have to prove
our high regard for El Libre.

174
00:18:43,514 --> 00:18:46,034
Ojo, you took the words
right out of my mouth.

175
00:18:46,105 --> 00:18:48,309
A brawl with the King's men. Let's go.

176
00:18:53,561 --> 00:18:57,358
Left, right. Left. Mark time!

177
00:19:00,121 --> 00:19:01,463
Right turn.

178
00:19:03,353 --> 00:19:04,368
Halt!

179
00:19:06,649 --> 00:19:10,392
Quick march! Forward! Halt! Turn!

180
00:19:19,129 --> 00:19:21,137
Right wheel!

181
00:19:26,073 --> 00:19:28,080
March!

182
00:19:30,297 --> 00:19:31,377
Halt!

183
00:19:33,241 --> 00:19:34,997
Present arms!

184
00:20:04,281 --> 00:20:05,742
Long live the republic!

185
00:20:05,817 --> 00:20:07,606
Rebels! Get them!

186
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,767
Long live El Libre!

187
00:20:23,832 --> 00:20:25,174
After them!

188
00:21:06,008 --> 00:21:07,218
There they are!

189
00:21:08,696 --> 00:21:10,103
Don't let them get away!

190
00:21:36,856 --> 00:21:38,744
Men! Come on!

191
00:22:44,727 --> 00:22:46,516
Come on! Quick, in that corner.

192
00:22:47,671 --> 00:22:49,100
There they go!

193
00:23:00,536 --> 00:23:02,162
Hurry up. ln back.

194
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,003
This way!

195
00:23:10,488 --> 00:23:11,436
Go ahead.

196
00:23:19,543 --> 00:23:20,656
Pierce the canvas.

197
00:23:33,943 --> 00:23:34,990
Fire!

198
00:23:42,199 --> 00:23:43,312
Ready? Fire!

199
00:23:53,688 --> 00:23:56,535
Pick it up! Lift it up!
Come on. Lift it up! Fire!

200
00:24:00,695 --> 00:24:01,840
Take us away.

201
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:05,842
They're getting away!

202
00:24:23,383 --> 00:24:25,805
Latch the cellars! Block the alley!

203
00:24:40,983 --> 00:24:42,096
Look out. Soldiers.

204
00:24:48,023 --> 00:24:49,168
Just a minute.

205
00:24:58,999 --> 00:25:00,308
Search the place.

206
00:25:57,302 --> 00:26:00,117
- The stink would drive away a pig.
- Which it did.

207
00:26:01,623 --> 00:26:03,248
Watch that door.

208
00:26:09,399 --> 00:26:11,471
You've saved us, lad, you've saved us.

209
00:26:11,542 --> 00:26:13,298
We're among our own kind.

210
00:26:14,582 --> 00:26:15,760
Rebels.

211
00:26:16,054 --> 00:26:18,421
Wouldn't surprise me
if you were El Libre himself.

212
00:26:18,647 --> 00:26:21,996
- You look like a born leader of men.
- The name's Pablo Murphy.

213
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:25,715
And l got enough lrish from me father
to know blarney when l hear it.

214
00:26:25,815 --> 00:26:28,498
We'd have slit your throats
for snooping spies by now...

215
00:26:28,566 --> 00:26:30,322
only for what you did to them soldiers.

216
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:32,397
- Who are they?
- Who knows?

217
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:34,859
This one can't talk
and this one can't keep quiet.

218
00:26:34,934 --> 00:26:38,229
All right, let's get to the point.
l'm Captain Vallo at your service.

219
00:26:38,294 --> 00:26:39,953
And this is Lieutenant Ojo.

220
00:26:43,062 --> 00:26:45,233
Vallo? The pirate?

221
00:26:45,302 --> 00:26:46,796
The Crimson Pirate?

222
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:49,837
That's right, sweet mother,
with a bargain for El Libre...

223
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:51,983
a shipload of powder shot and musketry.

224
00:26:52,054 --> 00:26:54,355
- Baron Gruda's ship.
- Baron Gruda's ship?

225
00:26:54,423 --> 00:26:56,724
Aye. Baron Gruda's own 30-gunner.

226
00:26:57,238 --> 00:27:00,108
We took her as easy as you'd take
a mackerel, fine fishermen.

227
00:27:00,182 --> 00:27:02,354
Easier. For we used dead bait.

228
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:04,779
You killed Baron Gruda?

229
00:27:05,974 --> 00:27:08,844
lf l did that you wouldn't need the guns
l want to sell you.

230
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:11,187
l'm a pirate, not a dog killer.

231
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:13,675
But l like you lads. l like your style.

232
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,572
So gather round and get this:

233
00:27:15,638 --> 00:27:19,413
The Baron will arrive in port
aboard my own ship in a matter of days.

234
00:27:19,478 --> 00:27:23,253
So how about taking me to El Libre
so we can close the deal for the guns?

235
00:27:23,318 --> 00:27:25,140
Time and tide, you know.

236
00:27:45,078 --> 00:27:47,085
Wash the stink off them
and take them below.

237
00:27:47,158 --> 00:27:48,500
Pass the word along.

238
00:28:09,013 --> 00:28:11,883
When it's dark,
we'll take them to the small boat...

239
00:28:11,958 --> 00:28:14,096
and row them out to their ship.
Come with me.

240
00:28:26,549 --> 00:28:28,175
Now, you know what the plan is.

241
00:28:28,246 --> 00:28:30,515
The rest will join my lads
at the fishing boats...

242
00:28:30,581 --> 00:28:33,069
and stand by the pirate vessel
to receive the guns.

243
00:28:33,142 --> 00:28:35,214
Suppose the pirates
refuse to give them up?

244
00:28:35,285 --> 00:28:37,969
l'll keep my knife at Captain Vallo's throat.

245
00:28:38,038 --> 00:28:40,688
Either he'll give the order
to hand over the guns...

246
00:28:40,757 --> 00:28:42,797
or he'll never give another order.

247
00:28:42,869 --> 00:28:45,935
You're cutting our throats,
Pablo Murphy, not his.

248
00:28:49,366 --> 00:28:51,853
l like your nerve, Pablo, but not your plan.

249
00:28:51,925 --> 00:28:55,886
l say we've got to get the guns and take
the palace before Baron Gruda gets here.

250
00:28:55,957 --> 00:28:59,470
And l say we need more than guns.
We need El Libre to lead us.

251
00:28:59,541 --> 00:29:02,224
You women won't face facts.
El Libre's been captured.

252
00:29:02,294 --> 00:29:04,116
The way to face facts is to rescue him.

253
00:29:04,181 --> 00:29:06,636
Rescue him?
From the King's prison? lmpossible.

254
00:29:08,277 --> 00:29:12,270
Not for a desperate man
with a 30-gunner and a fighting crew.

255
00:29:12,758 --> 00:29:14,896
A pirate rescue for El Libre?

256
00:29:15,157 --> 00:29:18,419
That'd be taking him from the frying pan
and throwing him into the fire.

257
00:29:18,485 --> 00:29:20,852
- We'll handle this our own way.
- About face!

258
00:29:20,917 --> 00:29:22,030
Get over here.

259
00:30:03,029 --> 00:30:04,753
There's a meeting! The door, quick!

260
00:30:20,661 --> 00:30:22,068
Out! The other door!

261
00:30:42,421 --> 00:30:44,908
lf l release you, can l count on your help?

262
00:30:46,548 --> 00:30:48,075
You'll be well paid.

263
00:31:05,621 --> 00:31:07,409
You misjudged our men.

264
00:31:07,861 --> 00:31:09,617
Don't misjudge our women.

265
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,621
- Another door here.
- Where?

266
00:31:12,693 --> 00:31:14,002
Follow me.

267
00:31:56,628 --> 00:32:00,010
- What's all the shooting?
- The Skipper coming back from market.

268
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:02,735
l have a feeling we'll be putting out to sea.

269
00:32:02,804 --> 00:32:06,481
Hoist anchor. Man all canvas. Look lively!

270
00:32:06,644 --> 00:32:08,553
Man the yards!

271
00:32:12,948 --> 00:32:14,192
Prepare to fire!

272
00:32:19,188 --> 00:32:20,432
Fire one!

273
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,384
Fire two!

274
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:49,420
Signal Baron Gruda's ship for a broadside.
One of us can knock her out of the water.

275
00:33:09,812 --> 00:33:13,227
Shore battery's asking for a broadside
against them, Mr. Bellows.

276
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,689
What are you waiting for, drooling idiot?

277
00:33:15,764 --> 00:33:19,113
- Give 'em a broadside!
- Aye, aye, sir! One broadside coming up!

278
00:33:37,268 --> 00:33:39,177
Good shooting, lads. Well aimed.

279
00:33:39,668 --> 00:33:42,089
Skipper, be that
what thou bought at market?

280
00:33:43,795 --> 00:33:46,032
Take the lady below
and make her comfortable.

281
00:33:49,619 --> 00:33:51,278
Thank you, Captain.

282
00:33:54,003 --> 00:33:56,010
The gallant Captain Vallo, eh, lads?

283
00:34:01,491 --> 00:34:03,630
Be that bit of fluff El Libre?

284
00:34:03,699 --> 00:34:05,804
That's the bit of fluff
that's taking us to him.

285
00:34:05,875 --> 00:34:09,869
He's being held on the lsland of San Perot,
only a day's sailing from here.

286
00:34:11,187 --> 00:34:13,227
Who's holding him for us, Skipper?

287
00:34:13,299 --> 00:34:17,674
The King's troop. ln the military prison.
Now, what could be sweeter, lads?

288
00:34:17,747 --> 00:34:21,424
We'll steal him from the King's men,
and sell him back to a king's man.

289
00:34:22,484 --> 00:34:26,161
- But be thou seriously planning to...
- Walk us into a king's prison?

290
00:34:26,228 --> 00:34:29,043
Why, not at all, Humble Bellows, not at all.

291
00:34:29,427 --> 00:34:31,532
Gather round, lads, gather round!

292
00:35:16,499 --> 00:35:20,875
- My, my, what a pretty knife.
- Would you like a closer look?

293
00:35:21,107 --> 00:35:23,528
Let's keep this pot
looking like a ship of the line!

294
00:35:24,147 --> 00:35:25,576
Come up here.

295
00:35:30,739 --> 00:35:31,917
Hop to it!

296
00:35:39,891 --> 00:35:42,128
l came up to talk about El Libre.

297
00:35:47,059 --> 00:35:50,059
- Go ahead. l'm listening.
- You have a plan to save him?

298
00:35:50,643 --> 00:35:53,643
A plan and a price.
Guns alone will cost 50,000.

299
00:35:53,715 --> 00:35:57,457
That's a great deal of money for guns.
How much are you asking for El Libre?

300
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:00,043
Oh, yes, El Libre.

301
00:36:00,787 --> 00:36:02,313
l'll throw him in for nothing.

302
00:36:03,763 --> 00:36:05,224
Very well, Captain.

303
00:36:05,299 --> 00:36:07,666
l'll see that the money
is arranged with him.

304
00:36:07,731 --> 00:36:10,153
You may be sure
that he'll honor the agreement.

305
00:36:10,995 --> 00:36:12,369
What's your plan?

306
00:36:16,882 --> 00:36:19,053
Why did you bolt
your cabin door last night?

307
00:36:19,314 --> 00:36:21,932
lf you know it was bolted,
you must've tried it.

308
00:36:22,067 --> 00:36:24,456
And if you tried it,
you know why it was bolted.

309
00:36:27,379 --> 00:36:29,321
How do you propose to get El Libre?

310
00:36:29,874 --> 00:36:31,784
ls your door open only to him?

311
00:36:33,043 --> 00:36:34,188
What do you mean?

312
00:36:34,259 --> 00:36:37,739
So much concern about one man
can't be entirely political.

313
00:36:38,258 --> 00:36:39,785
He's your lover.

314
00:36:40,274 --> 00:36:41,289
No.

315
00:36:42,002 --> 00:36:43,496
He's my father.

316
00:36:45,202 --> 00:36:46,446
Captain!

317
00:36:50,802 --> 00:36:52,209
Land ho!

318
00:37:07,922 --> 00:37:10,311
On your feet, lads. Attention!

319
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:18,283
You're supposed to be king's men,
not bard slabs.

320
00:37:18,482 --> 00:37:20,587
Look like you belong in those uniforms.

321
00:37:32,914 --> 00:37:36,013
Ojo, signal to the garrison
that Baron Gruda has arrived...

322
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:37,995
to take El Libre into custody.

323
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:53,032
- What about my father?
- l ordered you to stay below.

324
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:57,201
What are they signaling?

325
00:37:59,058 --> 00:38:02,407
The garrison commander wishes
to give a dinner in honor of Baron Gruda.

326
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:05,201
What are we going to do?

327
00:38:06,418 --> 00:38:08,720
We're going to accept, of course.

328
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:46,799
Baron Gruda and his bit of fluff...

329
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:49,932
left enough clothes onboard
to fool the King himself.

330
00:38:50,002 --> 00:38:51,528
lf anyone recognizes us...

331
00:38:51,601 --> 00:38:54,635
we'll be stripping for action
and taking El Libre the hard way.

332
00:39:02,161 --> 00:39:05,129
A fine body of men, Captain.
A fine body of men.

333
00:39:37,329 --> 00:39:41,159
His Excellency Baron Gruda and party.

334
00:39:57,201 --> 00:39:58,990
Welcome, Your Excellency.

335
00:39:59,057 --> 00:40:02,352
lt is a great honor for all of us
to meet you at last.

336
00:40:02,417 --> 00:40:05,320
lt gives us great pleasure
that you accept our hospitality.

337
00:40:05,393 --> 00:40:08,143
On the contrary, my dear Colonel,
it is l who am accepted.

338
00:40:08,209 --> 00:40:11,024
Oh, no, Your Excellency.
l am the lucky one.

339
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:16,081
l had instructions from the Governor
of Cobra to execute El Libre.

340
00:40:16,817 --> 00:40:19,719
l was on the verge of doing so
when l got your message.

341
00:40:19,793 --> 00:40:22,575
The Governor is an idiot!
l may replace him...

342
00:40:23,825 --> 00:40:25,102
with a military man.

343
00:40:25,809 --> 00:40:28,711
- My dear Baron.
- My dear Colonel.

344
00:40:34,065 --> 00:40:37,131
- May l introduce you to our guests?
- By all means.

345
00:40:47,825 --> 00:40:50,159
- Your Excellency.
- Your Excellency.

346
00:41:16,081 --> 00:41:19,430
But l have so much trouble
collecting the King's taxes here.

347
00:41:19,505 --> 00:41:22,407
Tell me, Count.
How do the people pay at home?

348
00:41:25,681 --> 00:41:28,332
Through the nose!
They pay through the nose!

349
00:41:29,969 --> 00:41:31,725
That's really very good!

350
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,899
How long do we have to play this game?

351
00:41:39,792 --> 00:41:42,280
Till the Colonel decides
to hand over El Libre.

352
00:41:42,353 --> 00:41:43,880
l am frightened.

353
00:42:07,569 --> 00:42:09,674
The Count must be
a constant delight to you.

354
00:42:09,745 --> 00:42:11,949
He's really too funny for words.

355
00:42:12,017 --> 00:42:13,162
lndeed he is.

356
00:42:13,233 --> 00:42:14,542
Do tell us, Count.

357
00:42:14,608 --> 00:42:17,870
What does the Queen wear
when she goes out these days?

358
00:42:19,984 --> 00:42:22,832
The Count always says
the Queen wears the King out.

359
00:42:23,216 --> 00:42:25,038
You are the wittiest man!

360
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:31,658
Ladies and gentlemen,
may l have your attention, please.

361
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,742
To commemorate the honor
Baron Gruda has done us by his visit...

362
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:41,706
the officers of the Saint Theo garrison
have arranged a little gift for him.

363
00:42:42,897 --> 00:42:45,352
Will everyone come this way, please?

364
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,520
On the left...

365
00:43:00,592 --> 00:43:05,065
you have that great lover of democracy
and the people, El Libre.

366
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,586
And on the right,
that distinguished scientist...

367
00:43:08,656 --> 00:43:10,598
Professor Prudence.

368
00:43:11,248 --> 00:43:13,582
Both caught like rats in a trap...

369
00:43:13,776 --> 00:43:17,802
conspiring against the greater glory
of His Majesty.

370
00:43:18,544 --> 00:43:21,708
But thanks to statesmen
like Baron Gruda...

371
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:26,534
such men and such ideas
will soon be destroyed.

372
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,098
As a distinguished scientist...

373
00:43:29,168 --> 00:43:33,445
l can assure you an idea has no physical
properties which can be destroyed.

374
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,335
As a lover of democracy and the people,
l can assure you...

375
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,702
both will survive your puny efforts.

376
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,368
As a statesman, l can assure you
that no one can foretell the future.

377
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,855
However, your fate at present
is as clear to me...

378
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,927
as the face of this beautiful lady
at my side.

379
00:43:49,999 --> 00:43:51,374
Bravo!

380
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,058
Thank you, Your Excellency.

381
00:43:58,447 --> 00:44:01,317
Yes. She is very beautiful.

382
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,588
His Excellency has a point.

383
00:44:04,655 --> 00:44:08,550
lt's foolish to quarrel with fate
when ours is so clearly in his hands.

384
00:44:10,063 --> 00:44:13,893
Take them outside and hold them
for Baron Gruda's pleasure.

385
00:44:18,544 --> 00:44:21,893
My dear Colonel, thank you
for a most rewarding evening.

386
00:44:21,968 --> 00:44:24,837
- And now we must go.
- lt is by no means over.

387
00:44:24,944 --> 00:44:27,529
l've arranged
a very special entertainment...

388
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:29,607
for this very special occasion.

389
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,352
lt's that dame we held for ransom.

390
00:45:03,919 --> 00:45:04,999
Abandon ship.

391
00:45:05,072 --> 00:45:07,974
- Thank you, my dear Colonel.
- Your Excellency!

392
00:45:08,495 --> 00:45:11,943
- But, my dear Baron!
- Wonderful evening, Colonel.

393
00:45:12,015 --> 00:45:13,095
Vallo!

394
00:45:18,959 --> 00:45:20,137
But, Your Excellency.

395
00:45:20,207 --> 00:45:23,753
Unexpected international affairs.
Happens to us diplomats all the time.

396
00:45:27,855 --> 00:45:30,222
- Put the prisoners in my carriage.
- Aye, aye, sir.

397
00:45:37,583 --> 00:45:40,583
l do hope the King will hear about this,
Your Excellency.

398
00:45:40,655 --> 00:45:41,964
Don't worry, he will.

399
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:46,222
Unclutch me, you polluted shrimp.

400
00:45:48,943 --> 00:45:50,666
Stop him, you fools!

401
00:45:51,055 --> 00:45:53,128
He's the Crimson Pirate!

402
00:45:53,199 --> 00:45:54,857
The Crimson Pirate?

403
00:46:02,671 --> 00:46:05,322
The Crimson Pirate!

404
00:46:07,311 --> 00:46:09,253
Take the Colonel to safety. Quick, man.

405
00:46:11,151 --> 00:46:14,348
- Take the Colonel to safety!
- Let me go, you fools!

406
00:46:15,503 --> 00:46:18,121
Don't worry, Colonel.
l'll take care of everything!

407
00:46:18,190 --> 00:46:21,158
- Citizen Ravel, save the Count!
- Save the Count!

408
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:32,294
- Sire! Sire!
- Good work, Captain.

409
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:35,112
Stop him! There's the Crimson Pirate!

410
00:46:35,695 --> 00:46:36,905
Captain!

411
00:46:38,543 --> 00:46:40,682
The officers are mutinying. Crush them!

412
00:46:41,935 --> 00:46:43,626
Crush them! Come on!

413
00:46:45,167 --> 00:46:46,476
Sound the attack!

414
00:46:49,999 --> 00:46:53,032
Hold the fort. Don't give an inch.
Protect the women and children.

415
00:46:53,103 --> 00:46:55,950
Reinforcements are on the way.
Lock the gates! Let no one out.

416
00:46:56,015 --> 00:46:57,924
Lock the gates! Let no one out!

417
00:46:57,999 --> 00:47:01,163
Long live the King!

418
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:07,783
l don't think we've met.
My name is Prudence.

419
00:47:07,855 --> 00:47:09,994
Captain Vallo, at your service.

420
00:47:12,047 --> 00:47:13,323
Thank you.

421
00:47:44,398 --> 00:47:46,307
What are you grinning at?

422
00:47:51,182 --> 00:47:54,150
So, l'm getting a halo.
You're afraid l'm getting soft.

423
00:47:54,958 --> 00:47:56,616
Yeah, you're wrong.

424
00:47:58,190 --> 00:48:02,216
lt's just that this is a new kind of caper.
These people are getting on my nerves.

425
00:48:02,798 --> 00:48:05,067
El Libre and his daughter
are strictly business.

426
00:48:06,638 --> 00:48:09,802
They haven't got me chained.
l've got them chained.

427
00:48:10,478 --> 00:48:12,518
l'll be rid of them soon enough.

428
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:15,273
Tomorrow, l'm delivering them
to Baron Gruda personally.

429
00:48:16,526 --> 00:48:18,184
What are you talking about?

430
00:48:43,054 --> 00:48:44,297
The girl?

431
00:48:48,718 --> 00:48:49,994
What about the girl?

432
00:48:53,902 --> 00:48:55,528
She's getting under my skin.

433
00:48:56,622 --> 00:48:58,597
She's putting crazy ideas in my head.

434
00:48:59,342 --> 00:49:03,335
She's unlocked my heart.
She's getting too close to me.

435
00:49:04,781 --> 00:49:06,156
She's got me hooked.

436
00:49:08,206 --> 00:49:09,548
She's blind.

437
00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:12,612
l'm blind. You're blind.

438
00:49:13,517 --> 00:49:14,794
Who's blind?

439
00:49:17,998 --> 00:49:19,591
Oh! Love is blind.

440
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:22,950
l am not in love!

441
00:50:08,045 --> 00:50:09,387
Avast there!

442
00:50:11,085 --> 00:50:14,282
l told you not to make so much noise.
Now the Skipper will get her.

443
00:50:14,349 --> 00:50:16,389
- He always does.
- Nobody will get her.

444
00:50:23,373 --> 00:50:24,966
Untie the others. Move!

445
00:50:25,037 --> 00:50:26,761
What's up? l'm having a little fun.

446
00:50:26,829 --> 00:50:30,178
- Come on, Skipper. Let us have some fun.
- You want her all to yourself?

447
00:50:30,254 --> 00:50:33,320
- Why don't you join the fun?
- Why don't you try yourself?

448
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:36,903
- You always tell that you couldn't make it.
- Always work and no fun.

449
00:50:49,485 --> 00:50:52,900
Mr. Bellows, take all three below
and bring me the cabin keys.

450
00:50:53,037 --> 00:50:55,525
lf you'll forgive
my pointing it out, Skipper...

451
00:50:55,597 --> 00:50:58,826
we can't leave a pretty woman
unmolested aboard ship.

452
00:50:59,245 --> 00:51:01,449
lt will give piracy a bad name.

453
00:51:01,581 --> 00:51:03,337
Are you challenging my orders?

454
00:51:05,005 --> 00:51:07,110
l'd never do that, Skipper...

455
00:51:07,373 --> 00:51:11,170
but seeing thou is selling these pigeons
to Baron Gruda anyway...

456
00:51:11,245 --> 00:51:14,889
l thought there could be no harm
to sport with them a bit first.

457
00:51:16,493 --> 00:51:18,184
No offense, Skipper.

458
00:51:32,525 --> 00:51:35,558
l'm putting you ashore tomorrow at Cobra
and giving you the guns.

459
00:51:36,621 --> 00:51:37,930
All of you.

460
00:51:39,565 --> 00:51:41,256
Just don't thank me.

461
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:19,878
Skipper.

462
00:52:28,621 --> 00:52:31,654
Yes, there's our ship.
With Baron Gruda waiting.

463
00:52:32,109 --> 00:52:33,963
Won't he hate paying for El Libre...

464
00:52:34,029 --> 00:52:37,607
when he finds out we stole him
out of one of the King's own prisons?

465
00:52:40,588 --> 00:52:44,233
- We'll heave to onto the point till nightfall.
- Aye, aye, Skipper.

466
00:52:49,036 --> 00:52:50,182
Slimey.

467
00:52:59,884 --> 00:53:03,975
- Let's see thee swim to yonder island.
- Aye, and back again.

468
00:53:04,428 --> 00:53:08,072
lf my plan works,
Baron Gruda himself will escort thee back.

469
00:53:08,524 --> 00:53:10,499
l've a message for thee to give to him.

470
00:53:10,892 --> 00:53:13,445
Do it, and when l am skipper...

471
00:53:13,644 --> 00:53:15,303
thou wilt be first mate.

472
00:53:18,604 --> 00:53:20,033
Mr. Bellows...

473
00:53:21,997 --> 00:53:24,996
- what about sharks?
- They never attack a man.

474
00:53:25,644 --> 00:53:27,749
Unless he attacks them first.

475
00:53:38,124 --> 00:53:39,815
- Governor.
- Baron?

476
00:53:40,493 --> 00:53:43,973
- Send him to the kitchen and feed him.
- Kitchen. Feed him.

477
00:53:47,052 --> 00:53:49,474
You'll have the 100,000 gold florin
ready for them.

478
00:53:49,548 --> 00:53:51,719
Whatever Your Excellency orders.

479
00:53:51,788 --> 00:53:55,400
- But this is sheer piracy.
- l assure you...

480
00:53:55,532 --> 00:53:59,045
l shall have El Libre, his daughter,
his distinguished conspirator...

481
00:53:59,116 --> 00:54:03,339
our ship, our guns, the pirates,
and Captain Vallo, without paying a sou.

482
00:54:03,596 --> 00:54:06,629
- Then why 100,000?
- Have the money ready, l said.

483
00:54:08,428 --> 00:54:12,203
The first mate thinks he can undo Vallo,
but his plan may fail.

484
00:54:13,004 --> 00:54:16,452
Even if we have to pay, such a haul
would be cheap at double the price.

485
00:54:16,523 --> 00:54:17,930
By the way...

486
00:54:18,412 --> 00:54:21,543
l shall want a barrel of this, well drugged.

487
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:31,587
- You disposed of Captain Vallo?
- No.

488
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:34,627
lt will be necessary to expose him
to the crew first.

489
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:38,530
Which l'll be doing soon enough,
if thou has followed my instructions.

490
00:54:38,603 --> 00:54:40,032
To the letter.

491
00:54:40,364 --> 00:54:43,146
And the money?
lf you'll forgive my impatience.

492
00:54:43,212 --> 00:54:45,284
lt will be waiting for you in the morning.

493
00:54:45,356 --> 00:54:48,487
Meanwhile, l place myself in your hands
as security for it.

494
00:54:48,555 --> 00:54:49,864
Very well.

495
00:54:49,931 --> 00:54:53,379
But l remind thee, they be murderous
hands when they're empty.

496
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:56,907
Hide His Excellency below.

497
00:55:27,019 --> 00:55:30,794
As soon as it's clear topside,
Ojo will stand by below with a small boat.

498
00:55:30,859 --> 00:55:33,729
lt's a short pull to shore. Call your father.

499
00:56:05,963 --> 00:56:08,297
Come with us. Join us.

500
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:11,265
No.

501
00:56:13,035 --> 00:56:15,817
But you want to. l know you want to.

502
00:56:16,939 --> 00:56:18,346
You're wrong.

503
00:56:19,179 --> 00:56:22,049
There's nothing in it for me.
Get your father.

504
00:56:26,635 --> 00:56:28,609
Then why are you setting us free?

505
00:56:28,683 --> 00:56:31,945
- l keep my promises, even foolish ones.
- You made no promise.

506
00:56:32,011 --> 00:56:34,978
You made a deal to sell us,
and you can't do it.

507
00:56:35,275 --> 00:56:38,952
All right, then. l'm doing it for you.
Let's leave it at that.

508
00:56:39,915 --> 00:56:42,664
No, Vallo. We can't leave it at that.

509
00:56:43,371 --> 00:56:45,607
You're a fighter. Fight with us.

510
00:56:46,155 --> 00:56:48,489
- Fight for something decent.
- Not l.

511
00:56:49,067 --> 00:56:52,995
All my life l've watched injustice
and dishonesty fly the flag of decency.

512
00:56:53,067 --> 00:56:55,816
- l don't trust them.
- Don't you trust me?

513
00:56:58,731 --> 00:57:01,513
Don't you trust what we have
for each other?

514
00:57:01,642 --> 00:57:04,774
What we have for each other
we'll have to get over.

515
00:57:07,083 --> 00:57:08,228
Can we?

516
00:57:25,835 --> 00:57:28,137
You're right. l won't let you go.

517
00:57:29,067 --> 00:57:32,744
We belong together here,
aboard my ship. We'll find a way.

518
00:57:34,923 --> 00:57:36,265
But that's not possible.

519
00:57:37,451 --> 00:57:41,412
- l can't stay here. Don't you see?
- Yes, l see.

520
00:57:42,763 --> 00:57:44,999
And now, at last, you see it, too.

521
00:57:45,835 --> 00:57:48,518
You've got your world, and l've got mine.

522
00:57:53,642 --> 00:57:55,366
All right, gentlemen.

523
00:57:58,763 --> 00:57:59,973
Sit down.

524
00:58:01,930 --> 00:58:04,680
Professor, you'll go ashore later
with Pablo Murphy and the guns.

525
00:58:04,746 --> 00:58:07,429
- Right.
- Keep talking to yourself, loudly.

526
00:58:07,530 --> 00:58:09,897
l want my men to think
you're all still here.

527
00:58:09,962 --> 00:58:11,872
That's no problem for me.

528
00:58:12,074 --> 00:58:14,692
Now, remember, this is a dangerous game.

529
00:58:14,826 --> 00:58:18,209
lf my men tumble to it,
they'll slit your throats, and mine, too.

530
00:58:18,283 --> 00:58:20,170
l don't like it, Captain.

531
00:58:20,618 --> 00:58:23,967
We can't leave you to face them alone.
Come with us.

532
00:58:25,003 --> 00:58:26,213
Father...

533
00:58:26,730 --> 00:58:27,712
don't.

534
00:59:12,714 --> 00:59:14,405
Avast! Man the guns!

535
00:59:21,866 --> 00:59:23,524
Topside, you swabs!

536
00:59:37,354 --> 00:59:38,434
Help!

537
00:59:43,818 --> 00:59:47,047
Not so fast, Skipper,
if you'll pardon the intrusion.

538
01:00:06,665 --> 01:00:10,048
You've sold me, Humble Bellows,
and to a king's flunky.

539
01:00:10,122 --> 01:00:11,136
Aye.

540
01:00:11,625 --> 01:00:15,171
'Tis my modest opinion
that no man can fly pirate's colors...

541
01:00:15,242 --> 01:00:19,104
who's not willing to sell his friend,
his sweetheart, or his mother.

542
01:00:19,178 --> 01:00:22,047
- Well spoken, Mr. Bellows.
- Foul spoken it is.

543
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:24,865
You've turned your hand
against your Captain's back.

544
01:00:24,938 --> 01:00:26,945
Yellow was never a pirate's color.

545
01:00:27,050 --> 01:00:29,766
Nor rescuing a fair maiden a pirate caper.

546
01:00:30,538 --> 01:00:31,552
Aye.

547
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:34,981
lt's true. l sailed beyond my depth...

548
01:00:36,425 --> 01:00:39,175
but only to sound out new waters
for the lot of us.

549
01:00:39,242 --> 01:00:43,300
lf we'd have starved to death,
l'd have never sold a man jack of you.

550
01:00:45,577 --> 01:00:49,352
Gather round, lads.
This isn't the last of the pirate capers.

551
01:00:49,417 --> 01:00:52,100
'Tis the last of thee and of thy capers...

552
01:00:52,522 --> 01:00:56,645
for 'twas put to the vote whilst thee
was trying to deprive us of our loot.

553
01:00:56,745 --> 01:01:00,607
Ye violated the pirate code
by letting a fat fish off the hook.

554
01:01:01,865 --> 01:01:04,680
By vote of all,
ye are deprived of command...

555
01:01:05,066 --> 01:01:09,157
and sentenced under piratical law
to be cast adrift in a small boat...

556
01:01:09,801 --> 01:01:11,590
without food or water.

557
01:01:14,121 --> 01:01:18,016
A splendid decision, Mr. Bellows.
Quick justice and certain death.

558
01:01:18,825 --> 01:01:22,981
Perhaps you'd save the King the expense
of hanging this learned fool...

559
01:01:23,145 --> 01:01:25,055
and let him keep Captain Vallo company.

560
01:01:26,281 --> 01:01:28,321
Thou hast a generous choice.

561
01:01:28,618 --> 01:01:30,440
The gallows or the sea.

562
01:01:38,473 --> 01:01:40,261
lf it won't crowd you.

563
01:01:42,153 --> 01:01:45,634
l'd rather you weren't coming,
but l don't want to seem inhospitable.

564
01:01:47,305 --> 01:01:48,734
As for thee...

565
01:01:50,057 --> 01:01:53,701
since l have no voice to raise against
thy Captain's misdemeanors...

566
01:01:53,769 --> 01:01:57,347
thee will be pardoned by giving thy hand
to thy new skipper.

567
01:01:57,641 --> 01:02:00,805
What say thee? Shall we loose thy bonds?

568
01:02:12,009 --> 01:02:13,438
Cut him loose.

569
01:02:47,721 --> 01:02:50,503
lt's done, Skipper. We set them adrift.

570
01:02:50,984 --> 01:02:53,701
The morning tide
will take them out to sea.

571
01:03:03,401 --> 01:03:06,532
Wait! This calls for a celebration,
eh, Mr. Bellows?

572
01:03:06,921 --> 01:03:10,750
l've a keg of rum aboard my boat.
Straight from the Governor's own cellar.

573
01:03:10,825 --> 01:03:12,035
What say?

574
01:03:13,576 --> 01:03:14,591
Aye.

575
01:03:14,984 --> 01:03:16,413
l could use a drink.

576
01:03:16,808 --> 01:03:19,143
Come on, lads! Get the rum aboard.

577
01:03:22,472 --> 01:03:24,807
Bring mine to the Captain's cabin.

578
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:33,470
There's the end of land.
The end of our world.

579
01:03:33,609 --> 01:03:36,227
From now on, it's starve, thirst,
and finally capsize.

580
01:03:36,808 --> 01:03:39,142
l've been meditating on just that.

581
01:03:39,529 --> 01:03:43,522
Capsizing is the solution of our problem.
There's no doubt about it.

582
01:03:44,648 --> 01:03:47,201
- lf you'll follow me, please.
- Sit down, you fool!

583
01:03:50,441 --> 01:03:51,848
Sit down, you...

584
01:04:22,248 --> 01:04:23,458
lt works.

585
01:04:25,096 --> 01:04:26,755
Good old Aristotle.

586
01:04:26,824 --> 01:04:29,093
Over 2,000 years ago, he wrote:

587
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:32,869
"A metallic vessel will retain air
underwater without filling."

588
01:04:32,937 --> 01:04:35,522
But l myself have done some research
on the subject...

589
01:04:35,592 --> 01:04:38,887
while designing a craft
which l call an undersea boat.

590
01:04:38,952 --> 01:04:42,629
- How did you know this was airtight?
- ln science, my son...

591
01:04:43,176 --> 01:04:45,794
one knows nothing until one experiments.

592
01:04:46,984 --> 01:04:49,700
We may now conclude
that we are breathing.

593
01:04:49,863 --> 01:04:52,230
Let us walk ashore as quickly as possible.

594
01:04:52,296 --> 01:04:55,645
l compute there's sufficient air
to last us several minutes.

595
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:58,502
Providing we don't waste
our oxygen talking, of course.

596
01:04:58,568 --> 01:05:00,989
- All right, then. Shut up!
- Quite so.

597
01:07:03,463 --> 01:07:07,357
You needn't have brought out
the whole garrison. l did the job myself.

598
01:07:07,431 --> 01:07:10,049
They won't be so playful
when they wake up this time.

599
01:07:10,119 --> 01:07:12,007
All right. Wake them up.

600
01:07:12,263 --> 01:07:14,368
Sober them up
and take them to the pirate ship.

601
01:07:14,439 --> 01:07:16,130
Over the side with them!

602
01:07:43,783 --> 01:07:46,630
Sorry l be for this, mates.
And l humbly apologize.

603
01:07:46,695 --> 01:07:49,379
'Twould never have happened
with Vallo as skipper.

604
01:07:49,671 --> 01:07:52,540
He violated a pirate code
and he had to go.

605
01:07:52,935 --> 01:07:56,066
But he went like a pirate.
We're going like fish.

606
01:07:56,135 --> 01:07:58,688
l can't forgive myself for that.

607
01:07:59,942 --> 01:08:03,074
King's flunky made a monkey
of Humble Bellows.

608
01:08:03,430 --> 01:08:06,147
- Pirate of the old school.
- Enough of that!

609
01:08:06,214 --> 01:08:07,523
Hoist them!

610
01:08:13,319 --> 01:08:15,872
Put a crew aboard this ship
and have her re-canvased.

611
01:08:15,943 --> 01:08:18,463
l want her ready to sail when l leave.

612
01:08:18,727 --> 01:08:22,142
Give them just enough bread
and water to keep them alive.

613
01:08:22,215 --> 01:08:24,932
They'll fetch a good bounty from the King.

614
01:08:58,566 --> 01:09:00,224
Ahoy. Pablo Murphy.

615
01:09:01,798 --> 01:09:04,100
- Well, l'll be...
- Get us out of these chains.

616
01:09:04,166 --> 01:09:07,232
After all you got us into,
you lying blabbermouth?

617
01:09:07,302 --> 01:09:09,124
Get yourself out of it.

618
01:09:21,414 --> 01:09:24,480
- Pablo Murphy.
- For the last time, get away from us.

619
01:09:24,967 --> 01:09:27,454
Get it through that head of yours,
l didn't sell El Libre.

620
01:09:27,526 --> 01:09:30,276
- Let me assure...
- We can see for ourselves what he's done.

621
01:09:30,342 --> 01:09:32,960
lf we'd gone my way,
El Libre wouldn't be dead.

622
01:09:33,030 --> 01:09:35,201
Consuelo wouldn't be held captive
in the palace...

623
01:09:35,270 --> 01:09:38,118
and we'd have guns to stop Gruda's men
from crushing us.

624
01:09:38,182 --> 01:09:40,287
Hold it, gentlemen. Soldiers.

625
01:09:49,030 --> 01:09:53,220
By order of Baron Gruda, all fishing
will be done under armed escort.

626
01:09:53,446 --> 01:09:55,748
The entire catch to be turned over
to the Governor.

627
01:09:55,814 --> 01:09:57,953
- What'll be left for us?
- The bait.

628
01:09:58,278 --> 01:10:00,066
ln that case, we'll do no fishing.

629
01:10:02,150 --> 01:10:03,841
Any more objections?

630
01:10:04,998 --> 01:10:07,997
The rest of you proceed
to the Governor's dock. Get moving!

631
01:10:09,382 --> 01:10:11,292
Take him to the fortress.

632
01:10:25,542 --> 01:10:26,752
This way.

633
01:11:07,653 --> 01:11:10,588
- Hey, there, back in line.
- Follow those boats.

634
01:11:43,845 --> 01:11:45,154
After them!

635
01:13:03,589 --> 01:13:04,799
Let's go.

636
01:13:35,940 --> 01:13:39,071
- ls everything arranged?
- Just as you ordered, Excellency.

637
01:13:39,141 --> 01:13:42,489
You've broken the back of the rebellion
overnight. The King owes you much.

638
01:13:42,564 --> 01:13:46,525
He will pay it. l may even be able to collect
the full bounty on Captain Vallo...

639
01:13:46,597 --> 01:13:50,339
for he was killed by his own men
while trying to save El Libre.

640
01:13:54,309 --> 01:13:56,196
Don't be upset, my dear.

641
01:13:56,549 --> 01:14:00,094
You'll form new attachments here.
You're to marry the Governor.

642
01:14:00,164 --> 01:14:02,815
After l'm gone,
you'll rule through her, Governor.

643
01:14:02,884 --> 01:14:05,918
You'll order your people to till their fields
and fish their seas...

644
01:14:05,989 --> 01:14:07,712
for the greater glory of the King.

645
01:14:07,780 --> 01:14:10,398
- l'd die first.
- No, you'll die last.

646
01:14:10,756 --> 01:14:13,626
First you'll watch your people go
one by one.

647
01:14:31,428 --> 01:14:33,217
Someday l'll kill you.

648
01:14:34,756 --> 01:14:35,934
Officer!

649
01:14:41,925 --> 01:14:43,899
These methods will bring her round soon.

650
01:14:43,972 --> 01:14:46,623
l shouldn't like her to kill herself
before she marries.

651
01:14:46,692 --> 01:14:50,554
She's not the type. She'll marry you
and wait for a chance to poison you.

652
01:14:50,628 --> 01:14:53,944
lt doesn't sound like an ideal marriage.
Couldn't we dispense with that?

653
01:14:54,020 --> 01:14:56,224
Too much of it upsets my liver.

654
01:14:58,116 --> 01:15:01,793
lt's not your liver. lt's your heart.
lt's much too soft.

655
01:15:04,932 --> 01:15:07,266
Tonight the people bury El Libre.

656
01:15:07,524 --> 01:15:10,721
l want a proclamation posted
in the path of the funeral procession...

657
01:15:10,788 --> 01:15:13,243
announcing your marriage
to the daughter of El Libre.

658
01:15:13,316 --> 01:15:14,592
Excellency!

659
01:15:15,268 --> 01:15:18,814
People will be required to attend
and provide entertainment...

660
01:15:18,980 --> 01:15:20,671
to make it a day of rejoicing.

661
01:15:20,740 --> 01:15:22,944
We'll have them fill
the royal grain warehouse...

662
01:15:23,012 --> 01:15:25,248
with 10,000 sacks of grain as a present.

663
01:15:25,732 --> 01:15:27,456
You're learning fast.

664
01:15:27,556 --> 01:15:31,931
After the ceremony, l'll leave you
my troops and my blessings, and depart.

665
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:38,010
Except for the late, lamented Vallo,
this has been a most boring assignment.

666
01:15:48,323 --> 01:15:51,836
On your way, pig! Amnesty
has been declared for all prisoners.

667
01:15:51,907 --> 01:15:55,323
Baron Gruda will give you a chance
to show allegiance at the wedding.

668
01:15:56,420 --> 01:15:57,565
Gruda.

669
01:15:59,204 --> 01:16:01,659
Gruda, someday l'll kill you.

670
01:16:02,628 --> 01:16:04,056
l'll kill you!

671
01:16:06,148 --> 01:16:09,563
- So it's a marriage now, is it?
- Consuelo will never do it.

672
01:16:09,636 --> 01:16:12,353
Look! 10,000 sacks of grain
for the Governor.

673
01:16:12,419 --> 01:16:13,630
Not mine!

674
01:16:14,020 --> 01:16:15,875
So we're to rejoice, are we?

675
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:32,219
Baron Gruda has made
the defacing of public property...

676
01:16:32,291 --> 01:16:34,463
an offense punishable by death...

677
01:16:34,532 --> 01:16:37,249
both for the culprit and the accomplices.

678
01:16:37,572 --> 01:16:39,808
Sergeant, round up these people.

679
01:17:08,067 --> 01:17:11,231
- What are you going to do about it?
- lt's no concern of mine.

680
01:17:19,427 --> 01:17:22,591
- What are you going to do about her?
- Get her out of it, somehow.

681
01:17:23,011 --> 01:17:25,313
Alone, against 1,000 troops?

682
01:17:25,859 --> 01:17:27,964
- There must be a way.
- There is.

683
01:17:28,035 --> 01:17:31,003
lt's a question of simple logic.
We need allies.

684
01:17:31,395 --> 01:17:33,915
These people need freedom.
Let's help them get it.

685
01:17:33,987 --> 01:17:36,409
The only freedom
l'm interested in is Consuelo's.

686
01:17:36,483 --> 01:17:39,550
She'll never consent to be free
until her people are free.

687
01:17:39,620 --> 01:17:40,929
lmpossible.

688
01:17:41,507 --> 01:17:44,060
They don't have a chance
against Gruda's crack troops.

689
01:17:44,131 --> 01:17:47,065
Science has learned
that nothing is impossible.

690
01:17:47,139 --> 01:17:50,881
Not long ago, l saw a ship
sailing through the skies of France...

691
01:17:50,947 --> 01:17:54,940
supported by a great bag filled with air
that was lighter than air.

692
01:17:55,555 --> 01:17:59,613
A friend of mine has invented a liquid
that can blast away mountains.

693
01:18:00,035 --> 01:18:04,094
l have completed plans for a boat
that can sail underneath the water.

694
01:18:04,739 --> 01:18:06,397
Who knows what we may accomplish...

695
01:18:06,467 --> 01:18:09,500
against the outdated Baron Gruda
and his outdated world?

696
01:18:09,571 --> 01:18:11,742
All we need is the help of these people...

697
01:18:11,843 --> 01:18:16,513
a little imagination, and deft fingers
with which to steal a few basic materials.

698
01:18:41,603 --> 01:18:43,294
The Baron thinks we're finished.

699
01:18:43,363 --> 01:18:45,818
We're going to let him go on thinking so.

700
01:18:45,891 --> 01:18:48,509
We'll fill the royal grain warehouse
as ordered.

701
01:18:48,579 --> 01:18:50,783
But with the seeds
of the Professor's genius.

702
01:18:50,851 --> 01:18:54,015
- l beg your pardon?
- The Baron has the most weapons.

703
01:18:54,083 --> 01:18:55,512
But we'll have the newest.

704
01:18:55,587 --> 01:18:58,653
An explosive that moves mountains.
A ship that flies through the air.

705
01:18:58,723 --> 01:19:02,367
A ship that flies through the air
by next Sunday? lmpossible.

706
01:19:02,883 --> 01:19:04,639
A great man once said to me:

707
01:19:04,739 --> 01:19:07,128
"Science has learned
that nothing is impossible."

708
01:19:10,371 --> 01:19:12,510
Gather round, lads and lasses.

709
01:19:12,962 --> 01:19:17,185
We'll show your fighters and workers
new ways to get rid of old enemies.

710
01:20:08,578 --> 01:20:10,400
lt doesn't smell right.

711
01:20:11,938 --> 01:20:14,556
10,000 sacks of grain have been brought
into the warehouse.

712
01:20:14,626 --> 01:20:16,634
The tunnel to smuggle them out
is complete.

713
01:20:16,707 --> 01:20:19,936
The island is making headway
with the modern weapons to smuggle in...

714
01:20:20,002 --> 01:20:22,173
and still you stand and stir...

715
01:20:22,242 --> 01:20:24,129
that stew with no result.

716
01:20:24,194 --> 01:20:26,877
My friend sent me no formula to go on...

717
01:20:26,946 --> 01:20:30,394
simply the ingredients.
Principally nitrogen and glycerin.

718
01:20:30,466 --> 01:20:32,887
Anyway, l'm not really sure
l want to discover it.

719
01:20:32,962 --> 01:20:36,540
lf it can remove a mountain,
how do l know it won't remove an island?

720
01:20:36,610 --> 01:20:39,578
"ln science, one knows nothing
unless one experiments."

721
01:20:39,651 --> 01:20:41,756
l wish you'd stop quoting me.

722
01:20:48,418 --> 01:20:50,141
That's it.

723
01:20:57,698 --> 01:20:58,908
Soldiers!

724
01:21:01,985 --> 01:21:03,928
Don't fall down with that.

725
01:21:04,162 --> 01:21:05,984
Even if they shoot you.

726
01:21:34,914 --> 01:21:37,696
Be careful you don't over-inflate this
in the morning.

727
01:21:38,017 --> 01:21:40,406
We've cut the wall braces
to the breaking point.

728
01:21:40,482 --> 01:21:43,581
But we don't want them to collapse
before the signal.

729
01:21:43,650 --> 01:21:44,730
Remember...

730
01:21:44,802 --> 01:21:48,598
there'll be no signal given till Consuelo's
gotten safely away from Baron Gruda.

731
01:21:55,041 --> 01:21:56,219
Careful.

732
01:22:02,785 --> 01:22:04,509
The liquid explosive.

733
01:22:06,082 --> 01:22:09,627
- ls that all that's left?
- l've improved a bit on the formula.

734
01:22:09,697 --> 01:22:12,086
This is concentrated 1,000 times.

735
01:22:22,177 --> 01:22:23,355
Please.

736
01:23:02,209 --> 01:23:05,689
The royal grain warehouse is reported
full to capacity, Your Excellency.

737
01:23:05,761 --> 01:23:08,544
Amazing how you brought them
to their knees.

738
01:23:08,609 --> 01:23:12,765
Spare the rod and spoil the child.
Never forget that, my dear Governor.

739
01:23:13,409 --> 01:23:15,481
Let's get on with the wedding ceremony.

740
01:23:18,081 --> 01:23:22,588
First, a floral offering for the bride
from the unmarried girls of the island.

741
01:23:22,657 --> 01:23:25,078
A local custom for celebrating weddings.

742
01:23:25,153 --> 01:23:26,876
- Proceed.
- Music.

743
01:24:01,665 --> 01:24:03,901
Watch it. Your beard is showing.

744
01:24:04,513 --> 01:24:05,822
Here we go.

745
01:24:11,041 --> 01:24:13,594
These peasant shapes are not to my taste.

746
01:24:25,249 --> 01:24:26,558
Death to Gruda!

747
01:24:37,888 --> 01:24:39,165
Kill them!

748
01:25:08,864 --> 01:25:10,871
Port side battery. Fire!

749
01:25:19,136 --> 01:25:21,275
No, l mean left. Left!

750
01:25:21,344 --> 01:25:23,548
No. Right. No, left a bit.

751
01:25:24,992 --> 01:25:26,519
What's the matter with you?

752
01:25:26,592 --> 01:25:28,632
Don't you know where you're going?

753
01:25:53,152 --> 01:25:54,200
Fire!

754
01:26:04,704 --> 01:26:06,362
We're going after the girl.

755
01:26:35,552 --> 01:26:36,894
Let's strip for action.

756
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:45,687
Halt!

757
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:51,259
We'll cut her to pieces. Man your cannons.

758
01:26:52,639 --> 01:26:53,784
Come on, now.

759
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:03,702
The high explosive. Quick.

760
01:27:39,679 --> 01:27:42,013
- Get underway!
- Aye, aye, sir.

761
01:27:44,383 --> 01:27:45,910
Man the capstan!

762
01:27:50,655 --> 01:27:52,084
Get her below.

763
01:27:53,695 --> 01:27:55,800
Don't waste time. Slit the cable!

764
01:28:00,191 --> 01:28:03,126
We've got to gain altitude.
Unload the ballast.

765
01:28:10,815 --> 01:28:12,571
Come on. Get rid of something.

766
01:28:23,103 --> 01:28:25,689
- What is it?
- lt is the wrath of heaven!

767
01:28:25,759 --> 01:28:27,614
lt has destroyed the fortress!

768
01:28:29,855 --> 01:28:32,440
Our ship and our lads.
We're heading straight for them.

769
01:28:33,791 --> 01:28:35,220
Make it close.

770
01:28:37,375 --> 01:28:38,782
But not too close.

771
01:28:38,847 --> 01:28:41,913
We'll need our ship and our lads
to catch Gruda.

772
01:28:47,231 --> 01:28:49,620
They're going to blow us up!
Jump for your lives!

773
01:29:22,335 --> 01:29:24,506
- lt's our own skipper!
- We knew you'd come.

774
01:29:24,574 --> 01:29:26,582
Get us off this ship.

775
01:29:26,655 --> 01:29:29,240
- Cut the rope down.
- Get us out of here!

776
01:29:45,215 --> 01:29:48,117
Pack out all canvas,
you fairy-tale sea snakes!

777
01:29:48,191 --> 01:29:49,500
Go get 'em!

778
01:29:54,623 --> 01:29:55,833
Move them!

779
01:29:56,062 --> 01:29:57,011
Move!

780
01:30:25,374 --> 01:30:28,342
l really think he plans to do battle with us.

781
01:30:31,038 --> 01:30:33,722
Captain Vallo's lost his head
as well as his heart.

782
01:30:47,806 --> 01:30:49,017
Haul that jib.

783
01:30:51,967 --> 01:30:53,789
Trim those top gallows.

784
01:30:54,558 --> 01:30:56,019
Two points starboard.

785
01:31:08,030 --> 01:31:10,038
Hold your fire for a broadside.

786
01:31:10,111 --> 01:31:12,150
Shall we fire?

787
01:31:12,222 --> 01:31:15,735
There'll be no firing with the girl
on the ship. We're going to board her.

788
01:31:24,542 --> 01:31:26,582
Below decks, the lot of you.

789
01:31:26,718 --> 01:31:28,147
On the double.

790
01:31:35,710 --> 01:31:37,401
Coming, Mr. Bellows?

791
01:31:39,230 --> 01:31:41,815
The fools are going
to trade broadsides with us.

792
01:31:48,862 --> 01:31:50,139
ln you go.

793
01:31:53,758 --> 01:31:56,475
With nobody at the wheel to steer,
we'll not get alongside.

794
01:31:56,542 --> 01:31:59,292
Too late to worry about it.
We'll have to take our chances.

795
01:31:59,358 --> 01:32:01,300
As ye wish. We'll go.

796
01:32:08,030 --> 01:32:09,818
My humble apologies.

797
01:32:09,886 --> 01:32:12,952
But if l can't live like a pirate,
l'll die like one.

798
01:32:13,021 --> 01:32:15,738
l'll stand by the wheel
and bring her alongside.

799
01:32:15,805 --> 01:32:18,172
Skipper! Do them the dirty!

800
01:33:07,037 --> 01:33:08,597
Stand by to fire!

801
01:33:18,334 --> 01:33:19,195
Fire!

802
01:37:02,331 --> 01:37:04,241
We're lost! Get the girl!

803
01:39:25,979 --> 01:39:28,215
Hold it, Professor! We've won!

804
01:39:28,475 --> 01:39:30,264
Get rid of that stuff.
