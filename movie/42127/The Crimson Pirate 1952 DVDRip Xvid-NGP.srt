1
00:00:17,329 --> 00:00:19,889
Man the yards! Quick on all canvas!

2
00:00:22,834 --> 00:00:25,029
Gather round, lads and lasses.
Gather round.

3
00:00:25,203 --> 00:00:28,639
You've been shanghaied aboard for 
the last cruise of the Crimson Pirate...

4
00:00:28,707 --> 00:00:31,471
a long, long time ago
in the far, far Caribbean.

5
00:00:31,577 --> 00:00:35,343
Remember, in a pirate ship,
in pirate waters, in a pirate world...

6
00:00:35,847 --> 00:00:38,543
ask no questions.
Believe only what you see.

7
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:47,954
No. Believe half of what you see.

8
00:00:49,828 --> 00:00:52,456
Man the capstan! Up anchor!

9
00:00:52,998 --> 00:00:54,898
Move, you lubbers!

10
00:02:22,721 --> 00:02:24,120
Ship to starboard!

11
00:02:36,735 --> 00:02:37,861
Attention!

12
00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:52,847
A scurvy ship, Your Excellency.

13
00:02:53,552 --> 00:02:57,488
You can tell by the position of the limbs.
Scurvy's killed the whole crew.

14
00:03:02,427 --> 00:03:05,055
A trim little ship, Captain Rodríguez.

15
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:08,490
We'll take her in tow.
She'll bring a tidy sum.

16
00:03:09,334 --> 00:03:12,826
Put an officer and two men aboard her,
and have her in tow by nightfall.

17
00:03:12,904 --> 00:03:14,166
Aye, aye, sir.

18
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:17,030
- Only evil can come from a death ship.
- Aye.

19
00:04:17,702 --> 00:04:19,727
Sanctus, one of them touched me!

20
00:04:20,906 --> 00:04:22,897
What happened to those two?

21
00:04:23,642 --> 00:04:24,904
Follow me.

22
00:05:00,712 --> 00:05:03,146
My humble apologies.

23
00:07:06,271 --> 00:07:07,203
Bored?

24
00:07:07,272 --> 00:07:10,867
If only there was something to 
break the monotony of this voyage.

25
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,807
Hands aloft, please.

26
00:07:20,952 --> 00:07:23,785
You're the prisoners of Captain Vallo
and his scurvy crew.

27
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:43,466
You may be overconfident, Captain Vallo.

28
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:46,169
Two hundred of the King's marines
are aboard this vessel.

29
00:07:46,244 --> 00:07:49,304
And only 20 pirates.
That puts the odds slightly in my favor.

30
00:07:49,381 --> 00:07:52,578
- Better surrender the ship.
- I am merely a passenger.

31
00:07:53,218 --> 00:07:55,118
- Who is he?
- Baron Gruda.

32
00:07:55,186 --> 00:07:57,416
Special envoy to His Majesty.

33
00:07:59,124 --> 00:08:01,922
Well, this is a pleasure.

34
00:08:02,327 --> 00:08:05,694
- You hanged most of my friends.
- For murdering most of mine.

35
00:08:09,868 --> 00:08:12,530
Seems you have
only 199 marines now, Baron.

36
00:08:14,205 --> 00:08:17,572
198. Better persuade the Captain
to surrender.

37
00:08:17,709 --> 00:08:19,472
The Captain is not the type to...

38
00:08:21,212 --> 00:08:22,736
197.

39
00:08:22,814 --> 00:08:25,908
However, if you'll permit me
to speak to him...

40
00:08:29,554 --> 00:08:31,647
Ojo, pass the word for the Captain.

41
00:08:38,296 --> 00:08:41,026
Bring down the Captain!

42
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,030
Send down the Captain!

43
00:08:44,569 --> 00:08:46,560
Save the Captain!

44
00:08:46,638 --> 00:08:48,663
Send down the Captain!

45
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:54,974
Did you ask for the Captain, sir?

46
00:08:55,046 --> 00:08:57,947
Aye. Pay him my compliments
and show him in.

47
00:09:27,645 --> 00:09:29,670
Gather round, lads. Gather round.

48
00:09:34,285 --> 00:09:35,377
We're in luck.

49
00:09:35,453 --> 00:09:38,320
All hands will soon be digging 
into a fat divvy.

50
00:09:39,724 --> 00:09:42,955
We're heading for the biggest
and the best pirate days ever.

51
00:09:43,027 --> 00:09:45,928
And here's the rich tally in round numbers.

52
00:09:46,965 --> 00:09:48,626
"Muskets: 3,000.

53
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,391
"Powder kegs: 1,500.

54
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:55,062
"Rounds of musket shot: 65,000.

55
00:09:55,807 --> 00:09:59,504
- "Rounds of cannon shot..."
- Begging thy pardon for interrupting...

56
00:09:59,911 --> 00:10:02,106
but when will thee get into the gold?

57
00:10:05,617 --> 00:10:07,244
Listen, fellows, listen.

58
00:10:07,318 --> 00:10:11,015
There are islands in these waters
steaming with rebellion against the King...

59
00:10:11,089 --> 00:10:14,149
and kept from boiling over
only for lack of guns.

60
00:10:14,225 --> 00:10:16,989
Islands where guns
are worth more than gold.

61
00:10:17,061 --> 00:10:19,359
- More than diamonds.
- Gunrunning?

62
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:22,627
But that's not piracy, Skipper.
That's business.

63
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:26,431
- That means working ashore.
- We're doing poorly enough afloat.

64
00:10:26,971 --> 00:10:30,429
If we're going to try this new caper,
let's make it a good one.

65
00:10:30,508 --> 00:10:35,411
This cargo will bring 50,000 gold florin
from any rebels worth the name.

66
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,916
- 50,000 florin?
- That's a pretty good take.

67
00:10:38,983 --> 00:10:41,315
Let's put it to the vote. All those in favor...

68
00:10:41,386 --> 00:10:44,150
If you'll forgive my interrupting, Skipper...

69
00:10:44,222 --> 00:10:46,816
I'd like to think before I vote.

70
00:10:47,192 --> 00:10:50,491
Meantime, we got
regular pirate business to settle.

71
00:10:51,362 --> 00:10:54,331
We got the plank, the culprit,
and the verdict.

72
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,062
All we need's a trial
and execution of a sentence.

73
00:10:58,136 --> 00:10:59,364
He's guilty!

74
00:10:59,704 --> 00:11:02,537
So much for the trial. Now for execution.

75
00:11:03,575 --> 00:11:05,543
Come on. Kill me, you fools.

76
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:10,047
The King's Navy will scour the Seven Seas
till every one of you is hung high and dry.

77
00:11:10,114 --> 00:11:13,015
- To the plank with him!
- Avast!

78
00:11:21,192 --> 00:11:23,160
There'll be no plank-walking for him.

79
00:11:23,228 --> 00:11:25,628
Forgive my slow-wittedness, Skipper...

80
00:11:25,697 --> 00:11:29,633
but are thee asking us to spare
this sweet-smelling toad?

81
00:11:30,268 --> 00:11:32,634
Begging Thy Excellency's pardon.

82
00:11:32,704 --> 00:11:35,867
Your captain's got more brains
than all of you put together.

83
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,135
No doubt you intend
to hold me for ransom.

84
00:11:38,209 --> 00:11:41,701
No, my fine-feathered friend.
I'm setting you free.

85
00:11:42,714 --> 00:11:46,377
I say, if there's no profit in the monkey
we'll have our pleasure.

86
00:11:46,451 --> 00:11:48,544
I say there is profit in him. Alive.

87
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,952
- How much profit?
- Now hear me out.

88
00:11:53,324 --> 00:11:56,589
I said 50,000 gold florin
from the rebels for the guns...

89
00:11:56,661 --> 00:12:00,791
and here, by special commission,
is the King's chief rebel-catcher.

90
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:04,197
So why not another 50,000
from him and his king...

91
00:12:04,269 --> 00:12:07,033
for telling them which rebels
we sell all the guns to.

92
00:12:07,105 --> 00:12:08,231
Eh, Baron?

93
00:12:08,306 --> 00:12:11,070
A brilliant scheme, Captain.
My congratulations.

94
00:12:11,142 --> 00:12:12,905
Thy congratulations.

95
00:12:13,711 --> 00:12:17,147
If thou art for it,
it is not for the good of pirates.

96
00:12:17,215 --> 00:12:19,206
Good? Gentlemen, it's magnificent.

97
00:12:19,284 --> 00:12:23,983
I'm bound for the Island of Cobra to catch
a man, El Libre, and smash his rebellion.

98
00:12:24,255 --> 00:12:28,351
If you'll take the guns there, lure him
out of his hole and into my hands...

99
00:12:28,426 --> 00:12:30,951
I'll raise the purse another 50,000.

100
00:12:31,863 --> 00:12:35,959
There it is, lads, in round figures:
150,000 florin.

101
00:12:39,237 --> 00:12:41,967
What do you say now,
Mr. Humble Bellows?

102
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,373
Thy humble servant will believe it...

103
00:12:45,443 --> 00:12:47,741
when thy humble servant sees it.

104
00:12:48,546 --> 00:12:50,946
I take it we have a deal, Captain.

105
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,815
This change of ship, Captain,
most uncomfortable.

106
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:29,181
My men won't transfer cargo.
Too much like honest work.

107
00:13:29,253 --> 00:13:32,745
Captain Vallo, your men have only left me
headsail and topsail.

108
00:13:32,824 --> 00:13:35,486
They're enough to get you to Cobra
sooner or later.

109
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,721
My ship is faster than this barge.

110
00:13:37,795 --> 00:13:41,458
I don't want you making port
before I've got El Libre ready for delivery...

111
00:13:41,532 --> 00:13:43,591
or putting a shot in my backside.

112
00:13:43,668 --> 00:13:47,104
I hope El Libre is not as careful
as you are, Captain.

113
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:00,841
Cast off helm!

114
00:14:02,754 --> 00:14:04,915
Cast off stern!

115
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:11,088
- Mr. Bellows, make sail!
- Aye, aye, sir!

116
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,117
Haul up, full and by.

117
00:14:38,589 --> 00:14:42,150
Nor' nor' east.
We're heading for the Isle of Cobra.

118
00:14:42,727 --> 00:14:44,786
Come on, you lubbers, move!

119
00:15:21,132 --> 00:15:23,999
Hear ye, hear ye!

120
00:15:24,268 --> 00:15:27,431
The King's vessel is now at anchor...

121
00:15:27,505 --> 00:15:30,963
in the port of Cobra
with Baron Gruda aboard.

122
00:15:31,042 --> 00:15:35,843
Any demonstration
will be regarded as high treason.

123
00:15:37,748 --> 00:15:39,875
The people seem very quiet, don't they?

124
00:15:39,951 --> 00:15:43,478
I don't think they intend to demonstrate
against Baron Gruda after all.

125
00:15:43,554 --> 00:15:46,250
- Apparently not, Governor.
- What a pity.

126
00:15:46,324 --> 00:15:48,918
Our troops could've cut them down
like wheat.

127
00:15:49,327 --> 00:15:51,727
Couldn't we shoot a few
on general principles?

128
00:15:51,796 --> 00:15:53,195
Might impress the Baron.

129
00:15:53,264 --> 00:15:55,630
He might feel
you are merely provoking trouble.

130
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,965
Most exasperating.
Fire the salute to Baron Gruda.

131
00:16:01,739 --> 00:16:03,104
Attention!

132
00:16:15,686 --> 00:16:19,918
Give the word and I'll dose
those backstabbers with a broadside.

133
00:16:20,258 --> 00:16:22,590
They're not firing at us,
you powder-brained ape.

134
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:26,858
They're giving us a 15-gun salute.
We're flying the flag of Gruda.

135
00:16:26,931 --> 00:16:30,128
Slimey, bring out the flags
and run up that message I gave you.

136
00:16:30,935 --> 00:16:33,597
And, Slimey,
give the Governor my compliments.

137
00:16:33,671 --> 00:16:35,195
The Crimson Pirate's?

138
00:16:35,273 --> 00:16:37,764
No, you oyster-head, Baron Gruda's.

139
00:16:38,509 --> 00:16:42,138
Mr. Bellows, keep the rest of these
half-masted monkeys below deck.

140
00:16:42,213 --> 00:16:43,510
Aye, aye, Skipper.

141
00:16:43,581 --> 00:16:46,641
Keep a sharp lookout, lads.
I'll be back with El Libre tonight.

142
00:16:46,717 --> 00:16:48,241
Let's go, Ojo.

143
00:16:55,459 --> 00:16:59,759
There goes a good pirate,
to sell his wares like a fish peddler.

144
00:17:00,298 --> 00:17:02,789
Meaning no disrespect to the Skipper,
of course.

145
00:17:02,867 --> 00:17:04,664
Us with a price on our heads...

146
00:17:04,735 --> 00:17:08,967
holed, too, in one of His Majesty's ports
like sitting ducks.

147
00:17:09,707 --> 00:17:14,110
But if the Skipper pulls us through again,
we'd be the ducks with the golden eggs.

148
00:17:14,178 --> 00:17:17,670
You're thinking of geese,
if you'll pardon the correction, Poison Paul.

149
00:17:18,115 --> 00:17:21,016
Geese on a wild-goose chase.

150
00:17:32,363 --> 00:17:33,830
What do they say, Joseph?

151
00:17:33,898 --> 00:17:37,231
They've got the plague onboard,
and they're quarantining themselves...

152
00:17:37,301 --> 00:17:39,360
until the victims are killed or cured.

153
00:17:40,771 --> 00:17:43,569
We must signal my profound condolences
to Baron Gruda.

154
00:17:43,641 --> 00:17:46,508
- Very well, Governor.
- Maybe it's all for the best, Joseph.

155
00:17:46,577 --> 00:17:48,943
El Libre's followers
may yet show their hands...

156
00:17:49,013 --> 00:17:51,846
and give me a chance to impress
the Baron. Order my carriage.

157
00:17:52,149 --> 00:17:56,245
Disperse the crowd. Change the guard,
and double your patrols in the street.

158
00:17:57,521 --> 00:17:59,455
Come on, my popsy-wopsy-wopsies.

159
00:18:10,368 --> 00:18:14,429
Plague, is it? May it take all of them.
Baron Gruda first.

160
00:18:14,872 --> 00:18:17,500
Aye, and if the plague don't, we will.

161
00:18:20,144 --> 00:18:22,704
- Who are you?
- Simple fisher folk like yourselves.

162
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:26,773
Put in for a tankard of ale, a friendly word,
and a chance to fight the King.

163
00:18:29,687 --> 00:18:31,177
Why choose us?

164
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,757
You look and talk like a fighter.

165
00:18:38,229 --> 00:18:39,662
It takes one to know one.

166
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:42,460
You may have us marked, all right.
Maybe not.

167
00:18:42,533 --> 00:18:44,524
But we haven't marked you yet.

168
00:18:44,602 --> 00:18:47,036
- We're asking no questions.
- We are.

169
00:18:47,972 --> 00:18:50,566
What I've heard about El Libre
is good enough for me.

170
00:18:50,641 --> 00:18:52,165
Tell us how to contact him.

171
00:18:52,243 --> 00:18:55,804
A man like him would be pleased to have
two more strong-armed lads aboard.

172
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,088
Not very trusting souls, are they?

173
00:19:16,834 --> 00:19:20,099
I guess we'll have to prove
our high regard for El Libre.

174
00:19:32,983 --> 00:19:35,611
Ojo, you took the words
right out of my mouth.

175
00:19:35,686 --> 00:19:37,984
A brawl with the King's men. Let's go.

176
00:19:43,461 --> 00:19:47,420
Left, right. Left. Mark time!

177
00:19:50,301 --> 00:19:51,700
Right turn.

178
00:19:53,671 --> 00:19:54,729
Halt!

179
00:19:57,108 --> 00:20:01,010
Quick march! Forward! Halt! Turn!

180
00:20:10,121 --> 00:20:12,214
Right wheel!

181
00:20:17,361 --> 00:20:19,454
March!

182
00:20:21,766 --> 00:20:22,892
Halt!

183
00:20:24,835 --> 00:20:26,666
Present arms!

184
00:20:57,201 --> 00:20:58,725
Long live the republic!

185
00:20:58,803 --> 00:21:00,668
Rebels! Get them!

186
00:21:16,053 --> 00:21:17,520
Long live El Libre!

187
00:21:17,588 --> 00:21:18,987
After them!

188
00:22:01,565 --> 00:22:02,827
There they are!

189
00:22:04,368 --> 00:22:05,835
Don't let them get away!

190
00:22:33,731 --> 00:22:35,699
Men! Come on!

191
00:23:44,501 --> 00:23:46,366
Come on! Quick, in that corner.

192
00:23:47,571 --> 00:23:49,061
There they go!

193
00:24:00,985 --> 00:24:02,680
Hurry up. In back.

194
00:24:05,389 --> 00:24:06,686
This way!

195
00:24:11,362 --> 00:24:12,351
Go ahead.

196
00:24:20,804 --> 00:24:21,964
Pierce the canvas.

197
00:24:35,819 --> 00:24:36,911
Fire!

198
00:24:44,428 --> 00:24:45,588
Ready? Fire!

199
00:24:56,407 --> 00:24:59,376
Pick it up! Lift it up!
Come on. Lift it up! Fire!

200
00:25:03,714 --> 00:25:04,908
Take us away.

201
00:25:07,284 --> 00:25:09,081
They're getting away!

202
00:25:27,371 --> 00:25:29,896
Latch the cellars! Block the alley!

203
00:25:45,722 --> 00:25:46,882
Look out. Soldiers.

204
00:25:53,063 --> 00:25:54,257
Just a minute.

205
00:26:04,508 --> 00:26:05,873
Search the place.

206
00:27:05,302 --> 00:27:08,237
- The stink would drive away a pig.
- Which it did.

207
00:27:09,806 --> 00:27:11,501
Watch that door.

208
00:27:17,915 --> 00:27:20,076
You've saved us, lad, you've saved us.

209
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:21,981
We're among our own kind.

210
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,548
Rebels.

211
00:27:24,855 --> 00:27:27,323
Wouldn't surprise me
if you were El Libre himself.

212
00:27:27,558 --> 00:27:31,050
- You look like a born leader of men.
- The name's Pablo Murphy.

213
00:27:31,128 --> 00:27:34,928
And I got enough Irish from me father
to know blarney when I hear it.

214
00:27:35,032 --> 00:27:37,830
We'd have slit your throats
for snooping spies by now...

215
00:27:37,901 --> 00:27:39,732
only for what you did to them soldiers.

216
00:27:39,803 --> 00:27:41,896
- Who are they?
- Who knows?

217
00:27:41,972 --> 00:27:44,463
This one can't talk
and this one can't keep quiet.

218
00:27:44,541 --> 00:27:47,977
All right, let's get to the point.
I'm Captain Vallo at your service.

219
00:27:48,045 --> 00:27:49,774
And this is Lieutenant Ojo.

220
00:27:53,016 --> 00:27:55,280
Vallo? The pirate?

221
00:27:55,352 --> 00:27:56,910
The Crimson Pirate?

222
00:27:56,987 --> 00:28:00,081
That's right, sweet mother,
with a bargain for El Libre...

223
00:28:00,157 --> 00:28:02,318
a shipload of powder shot and musketry.

224
00:28:02,392 --> 00:28:04,792
- Baron Gruda's ship.
- Baron Gruda's ship?

225
00:28:04,861 --> 00:28:07,261
Aye. Baron Gruda's own 30-gunner.

226
00:28:07,798 --> 00:28:10,790
We took her as easy as you'd take
a mackerel, fine fishermen.

227
00:28:10,867 --> 00:28:13,131
Easier. For we used dead bait.

228
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:15,661
You killed Baron Gruda?

229
00:28:16,907 --> 00:28:19,899
If I did that you wouldn't need the guns
I want to sell you.

230
00:28:19,977 --> 00:28:22,343
I'm a pirate, not a dog killer.

231
00:28:22,412 --> 00:28:24,937
But I like you lads. I like your style.

232
00:28:25,015 --> 00:28:26,915
So gather round and get this:

233
00:28:26,984 --> 00:28:30,920
The Baron will arrive in port
aboard my own ship in a matter of days.

234
00:28:30,988 --> 00:28:34,924
So how about taking me to El Libre
so we can close the deal for the guns?

235
00:28:34,992 --> 00:28:36,892
Time and tide, you know.

236
00:28:57,681 --> 00:28:59,774
Wash the stink off them
and take them below.

237
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:01,249
Pass the word along.

238
00:29:22,639 --> 00:29:25,631
When it's dark,
we'll take them to the small boat...

239
00:29:25,709 --> 00:29:27,939
and row them out to their ship.
Come with me.

240
00:29:40,924 --> 00:29:42,619
Now, you know what the plan is.

241
00:29:42,693 --> 00:29:45,059
The rest will join my lads
at the fishing boats...

242
00:29:45,128 --> 00:29:47,722
and stand by the pirate vessel
to receive the guns.

243
00:29:47,798 --> 00:29:49,959
Suppose the pirates
refuse to give them up?

244
00:29:50,033 --> 00:29:52,831
I'll keep my knife at Captain Vallo's throat.

245
00:29:52,903 --> 00:29:55,667
Either he'll give the order
to hand over the guns...

246
00:29:55,739 --> 00:29:57,866
or he'll never give another order.

247
00:29:57,941 --> 00:30:01,138
You're cutting our throats,
Pablo Murphy, not his.

248
00:30:04,715 --> 00:30:07,309
I like your nerve, Pablo, but not your plan.

249
00:30:07,384 --> 00:30:11,514
I say we've got to get the guns and take
the palace before Baron Gruda gets here.

250
00:30:11,588 --> 00:30:15,251
And I say we need more than guns.
We need El Libre to lead us.

251
00:30:15,325 --> 00:30:18,123
You women won't face facts.
El Libre's been captured.

252
00:30:18,195 --> 00:30:20,095
The way to face facts is to rescue him.

253
00:30:20,163 --> 00:30:22,723
Rescue him?
From the King's prison? lmpossible.

254
00:30:24,434 --> 00:30:28,598
Not for a desperate man
with a 30-gunner and a fighting crew.

255
00:30:29,106 --> 00:30:31,336
A pirate rescue for El Libre?

256
00:30:31,608 --> 00:30:35,009
That'd be taking him from the frying pan
and throwing him into the fire.

257
00:30:35,078 --> 00:30:37,546
- We'll handle this our own way.
- About face!

258
00:30:37,614 --> 00:30:38,774
Get over here.

259
00:31:21,525 --> 00:31:23,322
There's a meeting! The door, quick!

260
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:41,377
Out! The other door!

261
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:05,193
If I release you, can I count on your help?

262
00:32:06,903 --> 00:32:08,495
You'll be well paid.

263
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:28,655
You misjudged our men.

264
00:32:29,125 --> 00:32:30,956
Don't misjudge our women.

265
00:32:32,462 --> 00:32:34,089
- Another door here.
- Where?

266
00:32:34,164 --> 00:32:35,529
Follow me.

267
00:33:19,976 --> 00:33:23,503
- What's all the shooting?
- The Skipper coming back from market.

268
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:26,344
I have a feeling we'll be putting out to sea.

269
00:33:26,416 --> 00:33:30,250
Hoist anchor. Man all canvas. Look lively!

270
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,411
Man the yards!

271
00:33:36,993 --> 00:33:38,290
Prepare to fire!

272
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,797
Fire one!

273
00:33:53,877 --> 00:33:55,174
Fire two!

274
00:34:10,393 --> 00:34:15,023
Signal Baron Gruda's ship for a broadside.
One of us can knock her out of the water.

275
00:34:36,286 --> 00:34:39,847
Shore battery's asking for a broadside
against them, Mr. Bellows.

276
00:34:39,923 --> 00:34:42,414
What are you waiting for, drooling idiot?

277
00:34:42,492 --> 00:34:45,984
- Give 'em a broadside!
- Aye, aye, sir! One broadside coming up!

278
00:35:04,914 --> 00:35:06,905
Good shooting, lads. Well aimed.

279
00:35:07,417 --> 00:35:09,942
Skipper, be that
what thou bought at market?

280
00:35:11,721 --> 00:35:14,053
Take the lady below
and make her comfortable.

281
00:35:17,794 --> 00:35:19,523
Thank you, Captain.

282
00:35:22,365 --> 00:35:24,458
The gallant Captain Vallo, eh, lads?

283
00:35:30,173 --> 00:35:32,403
Be that bit of fluff El Libre?

284
00:35:32,475 --> 00:35:34,670
That's the bit of fluff
that's taking us to him.

285
00:35:34,744 --> 00:35:38,908
He's being held on the Island of San Perot,
only a day's sailing from here.

286
00:35:40,283 --> 00:35:42,410
Who's holding him for us, Skipper?

287
00:35:42,485 --> 00:35:47,047
The King's troop. In the military prison.
Now, what could be sweeter, lads?

288
00:35:47,123 --> 00:35:50,957
We'll steal him from the King's men,
and sell him back to a king's man.

289
00:35:52,062 --> 00:35:55,896
- But be thou seriously planning to...
- Walk us into a king's prison?

290
00:35:55,965 --> 00:35:58,900
Why, not at all, Humble Bellows, not at all.

291
00:35:59,302 --> 00:36:01,497
Gather round, lads, gather round!

292
00:36:48,384 --> 00:36:52,946
- My, my, what a pretty knife.
- Would you like a closer look?

293
00:36:53,189 --> 00:36:55,714
Let's keep this pot
looking like a ship of the line!

294
00:36:56,359 --> 00:36:57,849
Come up here.

295
00:37:03,233 --> 00:37:04,461
Hop to it!

296
00:37:12,776 --> 00:37:15,108
I came up to talk about El Libre.

297
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:23,378
- Go ahead. I'm listening.
- You have a plan to save him?

298
00:37:23,987 --> 00:37:27,115
A plan and a price.
Guns alone will cost 50,000.

299
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:31,092
That's a great deal of money for guns.
How much are you asking for El Libre?

300
00:37:32,128 --> 00:37:33,789
Oh, yes, El Libre.

301
00:37:34,564 --> 00:37:36,156
I'll throw him in for nothing.

302
00:37:37,667 --> 00:37:39,191
Very well, Captain.

303
00:37:39,269 --> 00:37:41,737
I'll see that the money
is arranged with him.

304
00:37:41,805 --> 00:37:44,330
You may be sure
that he'll honor the agreement.

305
00:37:45,208 --> 00:37:46,641
What's your plan?

306
00:37:51,347 --> 00:37:53,611
Why did you bolt
your cabin door last night?

307
00:37:53,883 --> 00:37:56,613
If you know it was bolted,
you must've tried it.

308
00:37:56,753 --> 00:37:59,244
And if you tried it,
you know why it was bolted.

309
00:38:02,292 --> 00:38:04,317
How do you propose to get El Libre?

310
00:38:04,894 --> 00:38:06,885
Is your door open only to him?

311
00:38:08,198 --> 00:38:09,392
What do you mean?

312
00:38:09,465 --> 00:38:13,094
So much concern about one man
can't be entirely political.

313
00:38:13,636 --> 00:38:15,228
He's your lover.

314
00:38:15,738 --> 00:38:16,796
No.

315
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,098
He's my father.

316
00:38:20,877 --> 00:38:22,174
Captain!

317
00:38:26,716 --> 00:38:28,183
Land ho!

318
00:38:44,567 --> 00:38:47,058
On your feet, lads. Attention!

319
00:38:52,709 --> 00:38:55,371
You're supposed to be king's men,
not bard slabs.

320
00:38:55,578 --> 00:38:57,773
Look like you belong in those uniforms.

321
00:39:10,627 --> 00:39:13,858
Ojo, signal to the garrison
that Baron Gruda has arrived...

322
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,925
to take El Libre into custody.

323
00:39:28,578 --> 00:39:31,604
- What about my father?
- I ordered you to stay below.

324
00:39:33,983 --> 00:39:35,951
What are they signaling?

325
00:39:37,887 --> 00:39:41,379
The garrison commander wishes
to give a dinner in honor of Baron Gruda.

326
00:39:42,325 --> 00:39:44,293
What are we going to do?

327
00:39:45,561 --> 00:39:47,961
We're going to accept, of course.

328
00:40:25,802 --> 00:40:27,667
Baron Gruda and his bit of fluff...

329
00:40:27,737 --> 00:40:30,934
left enough clothes onboard
to fool the King himself.

330
00:40:31,007 --> 00:40:32,599
If anyone recognizes us...

331
00:40:32,675 --> 00:40:35,838
we'll be stripping for action
and taking El Libre the hard way.

332
00:40:43,686 --> 00:40:46,780
A fine body of men, Captain.
A fine body of men.

333
00:41:20,356 --> 00:41:24,349
His Excellency Baron Gruda and party.

334
00:41:41,077 --> 00:41:42,942
Welcome, Your Excellency.

335
00:41:43,012 --> 00:41:46,448
It is a great honor for all of us
to meet you at last.

336
00:41:46,516 --> 00:41:49,542
It gives us great pleasure
that you accept our hospitality.

337
00:41:49,619 --> 00:41:52,486
On the contrary, my dear Colonel,
it is I who am accepted.

338
00:41:52,555 --> 00:41:55,490
Oh, no, Your Excellency.
I am the lucky one.

339
00:41:56,325 --> 00:42:00,762
I had instructions from the Governor
of Cobra to execute El Libre.

340
00:42:01,531 --> 00:42:04,557
I was on the verge of doing so
when I got your message.

341
00:42:04,634 --> 00:42:07,535
The Governor is an idiot!
I may replace him...

342
00:42:08,838 --> 00:42:10,169
with a military man.

343
00:42:10,907 --> 00:42:13,933
- My dear Baron.
- My dear Colonel.

344
00:42:19,515 --> 00:42:22,712
- May I introduce you to our guests?
- By all means.

345
00:42:33,863 --> 00:42:36,297
- Your Excellency.
- Your Excellency.

346
00:43:03,326 --> 00:43:06,818
But I have so much trouble
collecting the King's taxes here.

347
00:43:06,896 --> 00:43:09,922
Tell me, Count.
How do the people pay at home?

348
00:43:13,336 --> 00:43:16,100
Through the nose!
They pay through the nose!

349
00:43:17,807 --> 00:43:19,638
That's really very good!

350
00:43:23,846 --> 00:43:26,076
How long do we have to play this game?

351
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:30,644
Till the Colonel decides
to hand over El Libre.

352
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,312
I am frightened.

353
00:43:57,013 --> 00:43:59,208
The Count must be
a constant delight to you.

354
00:43:59,282 --> 00:44:01,580
He's really too funny for words.

355
00:44:01,651 --> 00:44:02,845
Indeed he is.

356
00:44:02,919 --> 00:44:04,284
Do tell us, Count.

357
00:44:04,353 --> 00:44:07,754
What does the Queen wear
when she goes out these days?

358
00:44:09,959 --> 00:44:12,928
The Count always says
the Queen wears the King out.

359
00:44:13,329 --> 00:44:15,229
You are the wittiest man!

360
00:44:18,467 --> 00:44:22,130
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention, please.

361
00:44:23,406 --> 00:44:27,433
To commemorate the honor
Baron Gruda has done us by his visit...

362
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:32,609
the officers of the Saint Theo garrison
have arranged a little gift for him.

363
00:44:33,849 --> 00:44:36,409
Will everyone come this way, please?

364
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:52,226
On the left...

365
00:44:52,301 --> 00:44:56,965
you have that great lover of democracy
and the people, El Libre.

366
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,637
And on the right,
that distinguished scientist...

367
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:02,735
Professor Prudence.

368
00:45:03,412 --> 00:45:05,846
Both caught like rats in a trap...

369
00:45:06,048 --> 00:45:10,246
conspiring against the greater glory
of His Majesty.

370
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:14,319
But thanks to statesmen
like Baron Gruda...

371
00:45:14,857 --> 00:45:19,351
such men and such ideas
will soon be destroyed.

372
00:45:20,296 --> 00:45:22,025
As a distinguished scientist...

373
00:45:22,098 --> 00:45:26,558
I can assure you an idea has no physical
properties which can be destroyed.

374
00:45:26,636 --> 00:45:29,571
As a lover of democracy and the people,
I can assure you...

375
00:45:29,639 --> 00:45:32,039
both will survive your puny efforts.

376
00:45:33,309 --> 00:45:36,904
As a statesman, I can assure you
that no one can foretell the future.

377
00:45:36,979 --> 00:45:40,540
However, your fate at present
is as clear to me...

378
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:43,744
as the face of this beautiful lady
at my side.

379
00:45:43,819 --> 00:45:45,252
Bravo!

380
00:45:45,321 --> 00:45:48,051
Thank you, Your Excellency.

381
00:45:52,628 --> 00:45:55,620
Yes. She is very beautiful.

382
00:45:57,166 --> 00:45:59,031
His Excellency has a point.

383
00:45:59,101 --> 00:46:03,162
It's foolish to quarrel with fate
when ours is so clearly in his hands.

384
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:08,733
Take them outside and hold them
for Baron Gruda's pleasure.

385
00:46:13,582 --> 00:46:17,074
My dear Colonel, thank you
for a most rewarding evening.

386
00:46:17,153 --> 00:46:20,145
- And now we must go.
- It is by no means over.

387
00:46:20,256 --> 00:46:22,952
I've arranged
a very special entertainment...

388
00:46:23,025 --> 00:46:25,118
for this very special occasion.

389
00:46:47,717 --> 00:46:49,878
It's that dame we held for ransom.

390
00:47:00,896 --> 00:47:02,022
Abandon ship.

391
00:47:02,098 --> 00:47:05,124
- Thank you, my dear Colonel.
- Your Excellency!

392
00:47:05,668 --> 00:47:09,263
- But, my dear Baron!
- Wonderful evening, Colonel.

393
00:47:09,338 --> 00:47:10,464
Vallo!

394
00:47:16,579 --> 00:47:17,807
But, Your Excellency.

395
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:21,577
Unexpected international affairs.
Happens to us diplomats all the time.

396
00:47:25,855 --> 00:47:28,323
- Put the prisoners in my carriage.
- Aye, aye, sir.

397
00:47:35,998 --> 00:47:39,126
I do hope the King will hear about this,
Your Excellency.

398
00:47:39,201 --> 00:47:40,566
Don't worry, he will.

399
00:47:42,071 --> 00:47:45,006
Unclutch me, you polluted shrimp.

400
00:47:47,843 --> 00:47:49,640
Stop him, you fools!

401
00:47:50,045 --> 00:47:52,206
He's the Crimson Pirate!

402
00:47:52,281 --> 00:47:54,010
The Crimson Pirate?

403
00:48:02,158 --> 00:48:04,922
The Crimson Pirate!

404
00:48:06,996 --> 00:48:09,021
Take the Colonel to safety. Quick, man.

405
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,333
- Take the Colonel to safety!
- Let me go, you fools!

406
00:48:15,538 --> 00:48:18,268
Don't worry, Colonel.
I'll take care of everything!

407
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:21,434
- Citizen Ravel, save the Count!
- Save the Count!

408
00:48:30,486 --> 00:48:33,046
- Sire! Sire!
- Good work, Captain.

409
00:48:33,322 --> 00:48:35,984
Stop him! There's the Crimson Pirate!

410
00:48:36,592 --> 00:48:37,854
Captain!

411
00:48:39,562 --> 00:48:41,792
The officers are mutinying. Crush them!

412
00:48:43,098 --> 00:48:44,861
Crush them! Come on!

413
00:48:46,469 --> 00:48:47,834
Sound the attack!

414
00:48:51,507 --> 00:48:54,670
Hold the fort. Don't give an inch.
Protect the women and children.

415
00:48:54,743 --> 00:48:57,712
Reinforcements are on the way.
Lock the gates! Let no one out.

416
00:48:57,780 --> 00:48:59,771
Lock the gates! Let no one out!

417
00:48:59,849 --> 00:49:03,148
Long live the King!

418
00:49:07,389 --> 00:49:10,051
I don't think we've met.
My name is Prudence.

419
00:49:10,125 --> 00:49:12,355
Captain Vallo, at your service.

420
00:49:14,497 --> 00:49:15,828
Thank you.

421
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:50,221
What are you grinning at?

422
00:49:55,304 --> 00:49:58,398
So, I'm getting a halo.
You're afraid I'm getting soft.

423
00:49:59,241 --> 00:50:00,970
Yeah, you're wrong.

424
00:50:02,611 --> 00:50:06,809
It's just that this is a new kind of caper.
These people are getting on my nerves.

425
00:50:07,416 --> 00:50:09,782
El Libre and his daughter
are strictly business.

426
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:14,719
They haven't got me chained.
I've got them chained.

427
00:50:15,424 --> 00:50:17,551
I'll be rid of them soon enough.

428
00:50:17,626 --> 00:50:20,424
Tomorrow, I'm delivering them
to Baron Gruda personally.

429
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:23,459
What are you talking about?

430
00:50:49,391 --> 00:50:50,688
The girl?

431
00:50:55,297 --> 00:50:56,628
What about the girl?

432
00:51:00,703 --> 00:51:02,398
She's getting under my skin.

433
00:51:03,539 --> 00:51:05,598
She's putting crazy ideas in my head.

434
00:51:06,375 --> 00:51:10,539
She's unlocked my heart.
She's getting too close to me.

435
00:51:12,047 --> 00:51:13,480
She's got me hooked.

436
00:51:15,618 --> 00:51:17,017
She's blind.

437
00:51:18,187 --> 00:51:20,212
I'm blind. You're blind.

438
00:51:21,156 --> 00:51:22,487
Who's blind?

439
00:51:25,828 --> 00:51:27,489
Oh! Love is blind.

440
00:51:29,365 --> 00:51:30,992
I am not in love!

441
00:52:18,013 --> 00:52:19,412
Avast there!

442
00:52:21,183 --> 00:52:24,516
I told you not to make so much noise.
Now the Skipper will get her.

443
00:52:24,586 --> 00:52:26,713
- He always does.
- Nobody will get her.

444
00:52:33,996 --> 00:52:35,657
Untie the others. Move!

445
00:52:35,731 --> 00:52:37,528
What's up? I'm having a little fun.

446
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:41,091
- Come on, Skipper. Let us have some fun.
- You want her all to yoursel<u>f?</u>.

447
00:52:41,170 --> 00:52:44,367
- Why don't you join the fun?
- Why don't you try yoursel<u>f?</u>.

448
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:48,103
- You always tell that you couldn't make it.
- Always work and no fun.

449
00:53:01,223 --> 00:53:04,784
Mr. Bellows, take all three below
and bring me the cabin keys.

450
00:53:04,927 --> 00:53:07,521
If you'll forgive
my pointing it out, Skipper...

451
00:53:07,596 --> 00:53:10,963
we can't leave a pretty woman
unmolested aboard ship.

452
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,698
It will give piracy a bad name.

453
00:53:13,836 --> 00:53:15,667
Are you challenging my orders?

454
00:53:17,406 --> 00:53:19,601
I'd never do that, Skipper...

455
00:53:19,875 --> 00:53:23,834
but seeing thou is selling these pigeons
to Baron Gruda anyway...

456
00:53:23,912 --> 00:53:27,712
I thought there could be no harm
to sport with them a bit first.

457
00:53:29,384 --> 00:53:31,147
No offense, Skipper.

458
00:53:46,101 --> 00:53:49,264
I'm putting you ashore tomorrow at Cobra
and giving you the guns.

459
00:53:50,372 --> 00:53:51,737
All of you.

460
00:53:53,442 --> 00:53:55,205
Just don't thank me.

461
00:54:34,249 --> 00:54:35,477
Skipper.

462
00:54:44,593 --> 00:54:47,756
Yes, there's our ship.
With Baron Gruda waiting.

463
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:50,164
Won't he hate paying for El Libre...

464
00:54:50,232 --> 00:54:53,963
when he finds out we stole him
out of one of the King's own prisons?

465
00:54:57,072 --> 00:55:00,872
- We'll heave to onto the point till nightfall.
- Aye, aye, Skipper.

466
00:55:05,881 --> 00:55:07,075
Slimey.

467
00:55:17,192 --> 00:55:21,458
- Let's see thee swim to yonder island.
- Aye, and back again.

468
00:55:21,930 --> 00:55:25,730
If my plan works,
Baron Gruda himself will escort thee back.

469
00:55:26,201 --> 00:55:28,260
I've a message for thee to give to him.

470
00:55:28,670 --> 00:55:31,332
Do it, and when I am skipper...

471
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:33,269
thou wilt be first mate.

472
00:55:36,712 --> 00:55:38,202
Mr. Bellows...

473
00:55:40,249 --> 00:55:43,377
- what about sharks?
- They never attack a man.

474
00:55:44,052 --> 00:55:46,247
Unless he attacks them first.

475
00:55:57,065 --> 00:55:58,828
- Governor.
- Baron?

476
00:55:59,534 --> 00:56:03,163
- Send him to the kitchen and feed him.
- Kitchen. Feed him.

477
00:56:06,375 --> 00:56:08,900
You'll have the 100,000 gold florin
ready for them.

478
00:56:08,977 --> 00:56:11,241
Whatever Your Excellency orders.

479
00:56:11,313 --> 00:56:15,079
- But this is sheer piracy.
- I assure you...

480
00:56:15,217 --> 00:56:18,880
I shall have El Libre, his daughter,
his distinguished conspirator...

481
00:56:18,954 --> 00:56:23,357
our ship, our guns, the pirates,
and Captain Vallo, without paying a sou.

482
00:56:23,625 --> 00:56:26,788
- Then why 100,000?
- Have the money ready, I said.

483
00:56:28,664 --> 00:56:32,600
The first mate thinks he can undo Vallo,
but his plan may fail.

484
00:56:33,435 --> 00:56:37,030
Even if we have to pay, such a haul
would be cheap at double the price.

485
00:56:37,105 --> 00:56:38,572
By the way...

486
00:56:39,074 --> 00:56:42,339
I shall want a barrel of this, well drugged.

487
00:56:50,719 --> 00:56:52,812
- You disposed of Captain Vallo?
- No.

488
00:56:52,888 --> 00:56:55,982
It will be necessary to expose him
to the crew first.

489
00:56:56,058 --> 00:57:00,051
Which I'll be doing soon enough,
if thou has followed my instructions.

490
00:57:00,128 --> 00:57:01,618
To the letter.

491
00:57:01,964 --> 00:57:04,865
And the money?
If you'll forgive my impatience.

492
00:57:04,933 --> 00:57:07,094
It will be waiting for you in the morning.

493
00:57:07,169 --> 00:57:10,434
Meanwhile, I place myself in your hands
as security for it.

494
00:57:10,505 --> 00:57:11,870
Very well.

495
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:15,535
But I remind thee, they be murderous
hands when they're empty.

496
00:57:17,245 --> 00:57:19,213
Hide His Excellency below.

497
00:57:50,612 --> 00:57:54,548
As soon as it's clear topside,
Ojo will stand by below with a small boat.

498
00:57:54,616 --> 00:57:57,608
It's a short pull to shore. Call your father.

499
00:58:31,219 --> 00:58:33,653
Come with us. Join us.

500
00:58:35,724 --> 00:58:36,748
No.

501
00:58:38,593 --> 00:58:41,494
But you want to. I know you want to.

502
00:58:42,664 --> 00:58:44,131
You're wrong.

503
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,992
There's nothing in it for me.
Get your father.

504
00:58:52,774 --> 00:58:54,833
Then why are you setting us free?

505
00:58:54,910 --> 00:58:58,311
- I keep my promises, even foolish ones.
- You made no promise.

506
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:01,474
You made a deal to sell us,
and you can't do it.

507
00:59:01,783 --> 00:59:05,617
All right, then. I'm doing it for you.
Let's leave it at that.

508
00:59:06,621 --> 00:59:09,488
No, Vallo. We can't leave it at that.

509
00:59:10,225 --> 00:59:12,557
You're a fighter. Fight with us.

510
00:59:13,128 --> 00:59:15,562
- Fight for something decent.
- Not I.

511
00:59:16,164 --> 00:59:20,260
All my life I've watched injustice
and dishonesty fly the flag of decency.

512
00:59:20,335 --> 00:59:23,202
- I don't trust them.
- Don't you trust me?

513
00:59:26,241 --> 00:59:29,142
Don't you trust what we have
for each other?

514
00:59:29,277 --> 00:59:32,542
What we have for each other
we'll have to get over.

515
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:36,144
Can we?

516
00:59:54,503 --> 00:59:56,903
You're right. I won't let you go.

517
00:59:57,873 --> 01:00:01,707
We belong together here,
aboard my ship. We'll find a way.

518
01:00:03,979 --> 01:00:05,378
But that's not possible.

519
01:00:06,615 --> 01:00:10,745
- I can't stay here. Don't you see?
- Yes, I see.

520
01:00:12,154 --> 01:00:14,486
And now, at last, you see it, too.

521
01:00:15,357 --> 01:00:18,155
You've got your world, and I've got mine.

522
01:00:23,498 --> 01:00:25,295
All right, gentlemen.

523
01:00:28,837 --> 01:00:30,099
Sit down.

524
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:35,007
Professor, you'll go ashore later
with Pablo Murphy and the guns.

525
01:00:35,076 --> 01:00:37,874
- Right.
- Keep talking to yourself, loudly.

526
01:00:37,979 --> 01:00:40,447
I want my men to think
you're all still here.

527
01:00:40,515 --> 01:00:42,506
That's no problem for me.

528
01:00:42,717 --> 01:00:45,447
Now, remember, this is a dangerous game.

529
01:00:45,587 --> 01:00:49,114
If my men tumble to it,
they'll slit your throats, and mine, too.

530
01:00:49,191 --> 01:00:51,159
I don't like it, Captain.

531
01:00:51,626 --> 01:00:55,118
We can't leave you to face them alone.
Come with us.

532
01:00:56,198 --> 01:00:57,460
Father...

533
01:00:57,999 --> 01:00:59,023
don't.

534
01:01:45,947 --> 01:01:47,710
Avast! Man the guns!

535
01:01:55,490 --> 01:01:57,219
Topside, you swabs!

536
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:12,766
Help!

537
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:21,747
Not so fast, Skipper,
if you'll pardon the intrusion.

538
01:02:42,203 --> 01:02:45,730
You've sold me, Humble Bellows,
and to a king's flunky.

539
01:02:45,807 --> 01:02:46,865
Aye.

540
01:02:47,375 --> 01:02:51,072
'Tis my modest opinion
that no man can fly pirate's colors...

541
01:02:51,146 --> 01:02:55,173
who's not willing to sell his friend,
his sweetheart, or his mother.

542
01:02:55,250 --> 01:02:58,242
- Well spoken, Mr. Bellows.
- Foul spoken it is.

543
01:02:58,620 --> 01:03:01,180
You've turned your hand
against your Captain's back.

544
01:03:01,256 --> 01:03:03,349
Yellow was never a pirate's color.

545
01:03:03,458 --> 01:03:06,291
Nor rescuing a fair maiden a pirate caper.

546
01:03:07,095 --> 01:03:08,153
Aye.

547
01:03:08,963 --> 01:03:11,727
It's true. I sailed beyond my depth...

548
01:03:13,234 --> 01:03:16,101
but only to sound out new waters
for the lot of us.

549
01:03:16,171 --> 01:03:20,403
If we'd have starved to death,
I'd have never sold a man jack of you.

550
01:03:22,777 --> 01:03:26,713
Gather round, lads.
This isn't the last of the pirate capers.

551
01:03:26,781 --> 01:03:29,579
'Tis the last of thee and of thy capers...

552
01:03:30,018 --> 01:03:34,318
for 'twas put to the vote whilst thee
was trying to deprive us of our loot.

553
01:03:34,422 --> 01:03:38,449
Ye violated the pirate code
by letting a fat fish off the hook.

554
01:03:39,761 --> 01:03:42,696
By vote of all,
ye are deprived of command...

555
01:03:43,098 --> 01:03:47,364
and sentenced under piratical law
to be cast adrift in a small boat...

556
01:03:48,036 --> 01:03:49,901
without food or water.

557
01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:56,601
A splendid decision, Mr. Bellows.
Quick justice and certain death.

558
01:03:57,445 --> 01:04:01,779
Perhaps you'd save the King the expense
of hanging this learned fool...

559
01:04:01,950 --> 01:04:03,941
and let him keep Captain Vallo company.

560
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:07,347
Thou hast a generous choice.

561
01:04:07,655 --> 01:04:09,555
The gallows or the sea.

562
01:04:17,932 --> 01:04:19,797
If it won't crowd you.

563
01:04:21,770 --> 01:04:25,399
I'd rather you weren't coming,
but I don't want to seem inhospitable.

564
01:04:27,142 --> 01:04:28,632
As for thee...

565
01:04:30,011 --> 01:04:33,811
since I have no voice to raise against
thy Captain's misdemeanors...

566
01:04:33,882 --> 01:04:37,613
thee will be pardoned by giving thy hand
to thy new skipper.

567
01:04:37,919 --> 01:04:41,218
What say thee? Shall we loose thy bonds?

568
01:04:52,901 --> 01:04:54,391
Cut him loose.

569
01:05:30,138 --> 01:05:33,039
It's done, Skipper. We set them adrift.

570
01:05:33,541 --> 01:05:36,374
The morning tide
will take them out to sea.

571
01:05:46,488 --> 01:05:49,753
Wait! This calls for a celebration,
eh, Mr. Bellows?

572
01:05:50,158 --> 01:05:54,151
I've a keg of rum aboard my boat.
Straight from the Governor's own cellar.

573
01:05:54,229 --> 01:05:55,491
What say?

574
01:05:57,098 --> 01:05:58,156
Aye.

575
01:05:58,566 --> 01:06:00,056
I could use a drink.

576
01:06:00,468 --> 01:06:02,902
Come on, lads! Get the rum aboard.

577
01:06:06,374 --> 01:06:08,808
Bring mine to the Captain's cabin.

578
01:06:14,849 --> 01:06:17,841
There's the end of land.
The end of our world.

579
01:06:17,986 --> 01:06:20,716
From now on, it's starve, thirst,
and finally capsize.

580
01:06:21,322 --> 01:06:23,756
I've been meditating on just that.

581
01:06:24,158 --> 01:06:28,322
Capsizing is the solution of our problem.
There's no doubt about it.

582
01:06:29,497 --> 01:06:32,159
- lf you'll follow me, please.
- Sit down, you fool!

583
01:06:35,537 --> 01:06:37,004
Sit down, you...

584
01:07:08,703 --> 01:07:09,965
It works.

585
01:07:11,673 --> 01:07:13,402
Good old Aristotle.

586
01:07:13,474 --> 01:07:15,840
Over 2,000 years ago, he wrote:

587
01:07:15,910 --> 01:07:19,778
"A metallic vessel will retain air
underwater without filling."

588
01:07:19,847 --> 01:07:22,543
But I myself have done some research
on the subject...

589
01:07:22,617 --> 01:07:26,053
while designing a craft
which I call an undersea boat.

590
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:29,954
- How did you know this was airtight?
- In science, my son...

591
01:07:30,525 --> 01:07:33,255
one knows nothing until one experiments.

592
01:07:34,495 --> 01:07:37,328
We may now conclude
that we are breathing.

593
01:07:37,498 --> 01:07:39,966
Let us walk ashore as quickly as possible.

594
01:07:40,034 --> 01:07:43,526
I compute there's sufficient air
to last us several minutes.

595
01:07:43,605 --> 01:07:46,506
Providing we don't waste
our oxygen talking, of course.

596
01:07:46,574 --> 01:07:49,099
- All right, then. Shut up!
- Quite so.

597
01:09:56,804 --> 01:10:00,865
You needn't have brought out
the whole garrison. I did the job myself.

598
01:10:00,942 --> 01:10:03,672
They won't be so playful
when they wake up this time.

599
01:10:03,745 --> 01:10:05,713
All right. Wake them up.

600
01:10:05,980 --> 01:10:08,175
Sober them up
and take them to the pirate ship.

601
01:10:08,249 --> 01:10:10,012
Over the side with them!

602
01:10:38,846 --> 01:10:41,815
Sorry I be for this, mates.
And I humbly apologize.

603
01:10:41,883 --> 01:10:44,681
'Twould never have happened
with Vallo as skipper.

604
01:10:44,986 --> 01:10:47,978
He violated a pirate code
and he had to go.

605
01:10:48,389 --> 01:10:51,654
But he went like a pirate.
We're going like fish.

606
01:10:51,726 --> 01:10:54,388
I can't forgive myself for that.

607
01:10:55,696 --> 01:10:58,961
King's flunky made a monkey
of Humble Bellows.

608
01:10:59,333 --> 01:11:02,166
- Pirate of the old school.
- Enough of that!

609
01:11:02,236 --> 01:11:03,601
Hoist them!

610
01:11:09,644 --> 01:11:12,306
Put a crew aboard this ship
and have her re-canvased.

611
01:11:12,380 --> 01:11:15,008
I want her ready to sail when I leave.

612
01:11:15,283 --> 01:11:18,844
Give them just enough bread
and water to keep them alive.

613
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:21,753
They'll fetch a good bounty from the King.

614
01:11:56,824 --> 01:11:58,553
Ahoy. Pablo Murphy.

615
01:12:00,194 --> 01:12:02,594
- Well, I'll be...
- Get us out of these chains.

616
01:12:02,663 --> 01:12:05,860
After all you got us into,
you lying blabbermouth?

617
01:12:05,933 --> 01:12:07,833
Get yourself out of it.

618
01:12:20,648 --> 01:12:23,845
- Pablo Murphy.
- For the last time, get away from us.

619
01:12:24,352 --> 01:12:26,946
Get it through that head of yours,
I didn't sell El Libre.

620
01:12:27,021 --> 01:12:29,888
- Let me assure...
- We can see for ourselves what he's done.

621
01:12:29,957 --> 01:12:32,687
If we'd gone my way,
El Libre wouldn't be dead.

622
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:35,024
Consuelo wouldn't be held captive
in the palace...

623
01:12:35,096 --> 01:12:38,065
and we'd have guns to stop Gruda's men
from crushing us.

624
01:12:38,132 --> 01:12:40,327
Hold it, gentlemen. Soldiers.

625
01:12:49,443 --> 01:12:53,812
By order of Baron Gruda, all fishing
will be done under armed escort.

626
01:12:54,048 --> 01:12:56,448
The entire catch to be turned over
to the Governor.

627
01:12:56,517 --> 01:12:58,747
- What'll be left for us?
- The bait.

628
01:12:59,086 --> 01:13:00,951
In that case, we'll do no fishing.

629
01:13:03,124 --> 01:13:04,887
Any more objections?

630
01:13:06,093 --> 01:13:09,221
The rest of you proceed
to the Governor's dock. Get moving!

631
01:13:10,665 --> 01:13:12,656
Take him to the fortress.

632
01:13:27,515 --> 01:13:28,777
This way.

633
01:14:11,425 --> 01:14:14,485
- Hey, there, back in line.
- Follow those boats.

634
01:14:49,163 --> 01:14:50,528
After them!

635
01:16:12,313 --> 01:16:13,575
Let's go.

636
01:16:46,046 --> 01:16:49,311
- Is everything arranged?
- Just as you ordered, Excellency.

637
01:16:49,383 --> 01:16:52,875
You've broken the back of the rebellion
overnight. The King owes you much.

638
01:16:52,953 --> 01:16:57,083
He will pay it. I may even be able to collect
the full bounty on Captain Vallo...

639
01:16:57,158 --> 01:17:01,060
for he was killed by his own men
while trying to save El Libre.

640
01:17:05,199 --> 01:17:07,167
Don't be upset, my dear.

641
01:17:07,535 --> 01:17:11,232
You'll form new attachments here.
You're to marry the Governor.

642
01:17:11,305 --> 01:17:14,069
After I'm gone,
you'll rule through her, Governor.

643
01:17:14,141 --> 01:17:17,304
You'll order your people to till their fields
and fish their seas...

644
01:17:17,378 --> 01:17:19,175
for the greater glory of the King.

645
01:17:19,246 --> 01:17:21,976
- I'd die first.
- No, you'll die last.

646
01:17:22,349 --> 01:17:25,341
First you'll watch your people go
one by one.

647
01:17:43,904 --> 01:17:45,769
Someday I'll kill you.

648
01:17:47,374 --> 01:17:48,602
Officer!

649
01:17:54,848 --> 01:17:56,907
These methods will bring her round soon.

650
01:17:56,984 --> 01:17:59,748
I shouldn't like her to kill herself
before she marries.

651
01:17:59,820 --> 01:18:03,847
She's not the type. She'll marry you
and wait for a chance to poison you.

652
01:18:03,924 --> 01:18:07,382
It doesn't sound like an ideal marriage.
Couldn't we dispense with that?

653
01:18:07,461 --> 01:18:09,759
Too much of it upsets my liver.

654
01:18:11,732 --> 01:18:15,566
It's not your liver. It's your heart.
It's much too soft.

655
01:18:18,839 --> 01:18:21,273
Tonight the people bury El Libre.

656
01:18:21,542 --> 01:18:24,875
I want a proclamation posted
in the path of the funeral procession...

657
01:18:24,945 --> 01:18:27,505
announcing your marriage
to the daughter of El Libre.

658
01:18:27,581 --> 01:18:28,912
Excellency!

659
01:18:29,617 --> 01:18:33,314
People will be required to attend
and provide entertainment...

660
01:18:33,487 --> 01:18:35,250
to make it a day of rejoicing.

661
01:18:35,322 --> 01:18:37,620
We'll have them fill
the royal grain warehouse...

662
01:18:37,691 --> 01:18:40,023
with 10,000 sacks of grain as a present.

663
01:18:40,527 --> 01:18:42,324
You're learning fast.

664
01:18:42,429 --> 01:18:46,991
After the ceremony, I'll leave you
my troops and my blessings, and depart.

665
01:18:48,836 --> 01:18:53,330
Except for the late, lamented Vallo,
this has been a most boring assignment.

666
01:19:04,084 --> 01:19:07,747
On your way, pig! Amnesty
has been declared for all prisoners.

667
01:19:07,821 --> 01:19:11,382
Baron Gruda will give you a chance
to show allegiance at the wedding.

668
01:19:12,526 --> 01:19:13,720
Gruda.

669
01:19:15,429 --> 01:19:17,989
Gruda, someday I'll kill you.

670
01:19:18,999 --> 01:19:20,489
I'll kill you!

671
01:19:22,670 --> 01:19:26,231
- So it's a marriage now, is it?
- Consuelo will never do it.

672
01:19:26,307 --> 01:19:29,140
Look! 10,000 sacks of grain
for the Governor.

673
01:19:29,209 --> 01:19:30,471
Not mine!

674
01:19:30,878 --> 01:19:32,812
So we're to rejoice, are we?

675
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:49,854
Baron Gruda has made
the defacing of public property...

676
01:19:49,930 --> 01:19:52,194
an offense punishable by death...

677
01:19:52,266 --> 01:19:55,099
both for the culprit and the accomplices.

678
01:19:55,436 --> 01:19:57,768
Sergeant, round up these people.

679
01:20:27,234 --> 01:20:30,533
- What are you going to do about it?
- It's no concern of mine.

680
01:20:39,079 --> 01:20:42,378
- What are you going to do about her?
- Get her out of it, somehow.

681
01:20:42,816 --> 01:20:45,216
Alone, against 1,000 troops?

682
01:20:45,786 --> 01:20:47,981
- There must be a way.
- There is.

683
01:20:48,055 --> 01:20:51,149
It's a question of simple logic.
We need allies.

684
01:20:51,558 --> 01:20:54,186
These people need freedom.
Let's help them get it.

685
01:20:54,261 --> 01:20:56,786
The only freedom
I'm interested in is Consuelo's.

686
01:20:56,864 --> 01:21:00,061
She'll never consent to be free
until her people are free.

687
01:21:00,134 --> 01:21:01,499
Impossible.

688
01:21:02,102 --> 01:21:04,764
They don't have a chance
against Gruda's crack troops.

689
01:21:04,838 --> 01:21:07,898
Science has learned
that nothing is impossible.

690
01:21:07,975 --> 01:21:11,877
Not long ago, I saw a ship
sailing through the skies of France...

691
01:21:11,945 --> 01:21:16,109
supported by a great bag filled with air
that was lighter than air.

692
01:21:16,750 --> 01:21:20,982
A friend of mine has invented a liquid
that can blast away mountains.

693
01:21:21,422 --> 01:21:25,654
I have completed plans for a boat
that can sail underneath the water.

694
01:21:26,326 --> 01:21:28,055
Who knows what we may accomplish...

695
01:21:28,128 --> 01:21:31,291
against the outdated Baron Gruda
and his outdated world?

696
01:21:31,365 --> 01:21:33,629
All we need is the help of these people...

697
01:21:33,734 --> 01:21:38,603
a little imagination, and deft fingers
with which to steal a few basic materials.

698
01:22:04,765 --> 01:22:06,528
The Baron thinks we're finished.

699
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:09,160
We're going to let him go on thinking so.

700
01:22:09,236 --> 01:22:11,966
We'll fill the royal grain warehouse
as ordered.

701
01:22:12,039 --> 01:22:14,337
But with the seeds
of the Professor's genius.

702
01:22:14,408 --> 01:22:17,707
- I beg your pardon?
- The Baron has the most weapons.

703
01:22:17,778 --> 01:22:19,268
But we'll have the newest.

704
01:22:19,346 --> 01:22:22,543
An explosive that moves mountains.
A ship that flies through the air.

705
01:22:22,616 --> 01:22:26,416
A ship that flies through the air
by next Sunday? lmpossible.

706
01:22:26,954 --> 01:22:28,785
A great man once said to me:

707
01:22:28,889 --> 01:22:31,380
"Science has learned
that nothing is impossible."

708
01:22:34,761 --> 01:22:36,991
Gather round, lads and lasses.

709
01:22:37,464 --> 01:22:41,867
We'll show your fighters and workers
new ways to get rid of old enemies.

710
01:23:35,455 --> 01:23:37,355
It doesn't smell right.

711
01:23:38,959 --> 01:23:41,689
10,000 sacks of grain have been brought
into the warehouse.

712
01:23:41,762 --> 01:23:43,855
The tunnel to smuggle them out
is complete.

713
01:23:43,931 --> 01:23:47,298
The island is making headway
with the modern weapons to smuggle in...

714
01:23:47,367 --> 01:23:49,631
and still you stand and stir...

715
01:23:49,703 --> 01:23:51,671
that stew with no result.

716
01:23:51,738 --> 01:23:54,536
My friend sent me no formula to go on...

717
01:23:54,608 --> 01:23:58,203
simply the ingredients.
Principally nitrogen and glycerin.

718
01:23:58,278 --> 01:24:00,803
Anyway, I'm not really sure
I want to discover it.

719
01:24:00,881 --> 01:24:04,612
If it can remove a mountain,
how do I know it won't remove an island?

720
01:24:04,685 --> 01:24:07,779
"In science, one knows nothing
unless one experiments."

721
01:24:07,854 --> 01:24:10,049
I wish you'd stop quoting me.

722
01:24:16,997 --> 01:24:18,794
That's it.

723
01:24:26,673 --> 01:24:27,935
Soldiers!

724
01:24:31,144 --> 01:24:33,169
Don't fall down with that.

725
01:24:33,413 --> 01:24:35,313
Even if they shoot you.

726
01:25:05,479 --> 01:25:08,380
Be careful you don't over-inflate this
in the morning.

727
01:25:08,715 --> 01:25:11,206
We've cut the wall braces
to the breaking point.

728
01:25:11,284 --> 01:25:14,515
But we don't want them to collapse
before the signal.

729
01:25:14,588 --> 01:25:15,714
Remember...

730
01:25:15,789 --> 01:25:19,748
there'll be no signal given till Consuelo's
gotten safely away from Baron Gruda.

731
01:25:26,466 --> 01:25:27,694
Careful.

732
01:25:34,541 --> 01:25:36,338
The liquid explosive.

733
01:25:37,978 --> 01:25:41,675
- Is that all that's left?
- I've improved a bit on the formula.

734
01:25:41,748 --> 01:25:44,239
This is concentrated 1,000 times.

735
01:25:54,761 --> 01:25:55,989
Please.

736
01:26:36,503 --> 01:26:40,132
The royal grain warehouse is reported
full to capacity, Your Excellency.

737
01:26:40,207 --> 01:26:43,108
Amazing how you brought them
to their knees.

738
01:26:43,176 --> 01:26:47,510
Spare the rod and spoil the child.
Never forget that, my dear Governor.

739
01:26:48,181 --> 01:26:50,342
Let's get on with the wedding ceremony.

740
01:26:53,053 --> 01:26:57,752
First, a floral offering for the bride
from the unmarried girls of the island.

741
01:26:57,824 --> 01:27:00,349
A local custom for celebrating weddings.

742
01:27:00,427 --> 01:27:02,224
- Proceed.
- Music.

743
01:27:38,498 --> 01:27:40,830
Watch it. Your beard is showing.

744
01:27:41,468 --> 01:27:42,833
Here we go.

745
01:27:48,275 --> 01:27:50,937
These peasant shapes are not to my taste.

746
01:28:03,089 --> 01:28:04,454
Death to Gruda!

747
01:28:16,269 --> 01:28:17,600
Kill them!

748
01:28:48,568 --> 01:28:50,661
Port side battery. Fire!

749
01:28:59,279 --> 01:29:01,509
No, I mean left. Left!

750
01:29:01,581 --> 01:29:03,879
No. Right. No, left a bit.

751
01:29:05,385 --> 01:29:06,977
What's the matter with you?

752
01:29:07,053 --> 01:29:09,180
Don't you know where you're going?

753
01:29:34,748 --> 01:29:35,840
Fire!

754
01:29:46,793 --> 01:29:48,522
We're going after the girl.

755
01:30:18,959 --> 01:30:20,358
Let's strip for action.

756
01:30:28,435 --> 01:30:29,527
Halt!

757
01:30:32,539 --> 01:30:35,337
We'll cut her to pieces. Man your cannons.

758
01:30:36,776 --> 01:30:37,970
Come on, now.

759
01:30:46,286 --> 01:30:48,311
The high explosive. Quick.

760
01:31:25,825 --> 01:31:28,259
- Get underway!
- Aye, aye, sir.

761
01:31:30,730 --> 01:31:32,322
Man the capstan!

762
01:31:37,270 --> 01:31:38,760
Get her below.

763
01:31:40,440 --> 01:31:42,635
Don't waste time. Slit the cable!

764
01:31:47,213 --> 01:31:50,273
We've got to gain altitude.
Unload the ballast.

765
01:31:58,291 --> 01:32:00,122
Come on. Get rid of something.

766
01:32:11,104 --> 01:32:13,800
- What is it?
- It is the wrath of heaven!

767
01:32:13,873 --> 01:32:15,807
It has destroyed the fortress!

768
01:32:18,144 --> 01:32:20,840
Our ship and our lads.
We're heading straight for them.

769
01:32:22,248 --> 01:32:23,738
Make it close.

770
01:32:25,985 --> 01:32:27,452
But not too close.

771
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:30,717
We'll need our ship and our lads
to catch Gruda.

772
01:32:36,262 --> 01:32:38,753
They're going to blow us up!
Jump for your lives!

773
01:33:12,866 --> 01:33:15,130
- It's our own skipper!
- We knew you'd come.

774
01:33:15,201 --> 01:33:17,294
Get us off this ship.

775
01:33:17,370 --> 01:33:20,066
- Cut the rope down.
- Get us out of here!

776
01:33:36,723 --> 01:33:39,749
Pack out all canvas,
you fairy-tale sea snakes!

777
01:33:39,826 --> 01:33:41,191
Go get 'em!

778
01:33:46,533 --> 01:33:47,795
Move them!

779
01:33:48,034 --> 01:33:49,023
Move!

780
01:34:18,598 --> 01:34:21,692
I really think he plans to do battle with us.

781
01:34:24,504 --> 01:34:27,302
Captain Vallo's lost his head
as well as his heart.

782
01:34:41,988 --> 01:34:43,250
Haul that jib.

783
01:34:46,326 --> 01:34:48,226
Trim those top gallows.

784
01:34:49,028 --> 01:34:50,552
Two points starboard.

785
01:35:03,076 --> 01:35:05,169
Hold your fire for a broadside.

786
01:35:05,245 --> 01:35:07,372
Shall we fire?

787
01:35:07,447 --> 01:35:11,110
There'll be no firing with the girl
on the ship. We're going to board her.

788
01:35:20,293 --> 01:35:22,420
Below decks, the lot of you.

789
01:35:22,562 --> 01:35:24,052
On the double.

790
01:35:31,938 --> 01:35:33,701
Coming, Mr. Bellows?

791
01:35:35,608 --> 01:35:38,304
The fools are going
to trade broadsides with us.

792
01:35:45,652 --> 01:35:46,983
In you go.

793
01:35:50,757 --> 01:35:53,590
With nobody at the wheel to steer,
we'll not get alongside.

794
01:35:53,660 --> 01:35:56,527
Too late to worry about it.
We'll have to take our chances.

795
01:35:56,596 --> 01:35:58,621
As ye wish. We'll go.

796
01:36:05,638 --> 01:36:07,503
My humble apologies.

797
01:36:07,573 --> 01:36:10,770
But if I can't live like a pirate,
I'll die like one.

798
01:36:10,843 --> 01:36:13,676
I'll stand by the wheel
and bring her alongside.

799
01:36:13,746 --> 01:36:16,214
Skipper! Do them the dirty!

800
01:37:07,166 --> 01:37:08,793
Stand by to fire!

801
01:37:18,945 --> 01:37:19,843
Fire!

802
01:41:12,511 --> 01:41:14,502
We're lost! Get the girl!

803
01:43:42,294 --> 01:43:44,626
Hold it, Professor! We've won!

804
01:43:44,897 --> 01:43:46,762
Get rid of that stuff.

805
01:44:25,905 --> 01:44:26,894
English
