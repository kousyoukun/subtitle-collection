1
00:00:12,673 --> 00:00:15,128
Man the yards! Quick on all canvas!

2
00:00:17,955 --> 00:00:20,060
Gather round, lads and lasses.
Gather round.

3
00:00:20,227 --> 00:00:23,525
You've been shanghaied aboard
for the last cruise of the Crimson Pirate...

4
00:00:23,589 --> 00:00:26,240
a long, long time ago
in the far, far Caribbean.

5
00:00:26,342 --> 00:00:29,956
Remember, in a pirate ship,
in pirate waters, in a pirate world...

6
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,027
ask no questions.
Believe only what you see.

7
00:00:39,405 --> 00:00:42,056
No. Believe half of what you see.

8
00:00:43,854 --> 00:00:46,376
Man the capstan! Up anchor!

9
00:00:46,895 --> 00:00:48,719
Move, you lubbers!

10
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,323
Ship to starboard!

11
00:02:26,427 --> 00:02:27,507
Attention!

12
00:02:39,681 --> 00:02:41,886
A scurvy ship, Your Excellency.

13
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:46,338
You can tell by the position of the limbs.
Scurvy's killed the whole crew.

14
00:02:51,078 --> 00:02:53,598
A trim little ship, Captain Rodríguez.

15
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:56,895
We'll take her in tow.
She'll bring a tidy sum.

16
00:02:57,704 --> 00:03:01,055
Put an officer and two men aboard her,
and have her in tow by nightfall.

17
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:02,340
Aye, aye, sir.

18
00:03:59,557 --> 00:04:02,657
- Only evil can come from a death ship.
- Aye.

19
00:04:03,302 --> 00:04:05,244
Sanctus, one of them touched me!

20
00:04:06,376 --> 00:04:08,285
What happened to those two?

21
00:04:09,001 --> 00:04:10,211
Follow me.

22
00:04:44,568 --> 00:04:46,904
My humble apologies.

23
00:06:45,036 --> 00:06:45,931
Bored?

24
00:06:45,997 --> 00:06:49,447
lf only there was something
to break the monotony of this voyage.

25
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:52,267
Hands aloft, please.

26
00:06:59,122 --> 00:07:01,841
You're the prisoners of Captain Vallo
and his scurvy crew.

27
00:07:18,683 --> 00:07:20,724
You may be overconfident, Captain Vallo.

28
00:07:20,796 --> 00:07:23,318
Two hundred of the King's marines
are aboard this vessel.

29
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:26,326
And only 20 pirates.
That puts the odds slightly in my favor.

30
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,467
- Better surrender the ship.
- l am merely a passenger.

31
00:07:30,081 --> 00:07:31,903
- Who is he?
- Baron Gruda.

32
00:07:31,969 --> 00:07:34,108
Special envoy to His Majesty.

33
00:07:35,748 --> 00:07:38,431
Well, this is a pleasure.

34
00:07:38,821 --> 00:07:42,051
- You hanged most of my friends.
- For murdering most of mine.

35
00:07:46,056 --> 00:07:48,610
Seems you have
only 199 marines now, Baron.

36
00:07:50,216 --> 00:07:53,447
198. Better persuade the Captain
to surrender.

37
00:07:53,578 --> 00:07:55,271
The Captain is not the type to...

38
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,403
197.

39
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,446
However, if you'll permit me
to speak to him...

40
00:08:04,944 --> 00:08:06,953
Ojo, pass the word for the Captain.

41
00:08:13,332 --> 00:08:15,950
Bring down the Captain!

42
00:08:16,694 --> 00:08:18,833
Send down the Captain!

43
00:08:19,351 --> 00:08:21,260
Save the Captain!

44
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:23,278
Send down the Captain!

45
00:08:27,162 --> 00:08:29,334
Did you ask for the Captain, sir?

46
00:08:29,403 --> 00:08:32,186
Aye. Pay him my compliments
and show him in.

47
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,623
Gather round, lads. Gather round.

48
00:09:07,051 --> 00:09:08,098
We're in luck.

49
00:09:08,171 --> 00:09:10,922
All hands will soon be digging into
a fat divvy.

50
00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:15,369
We're heading for the biggest
and the best pirate days ever.

51
00:09:15,438 --> 00:09:18,221
And here's the rich tally in round numbers.

52
00:09:19,217 --> 00:09:20,810
"Muskets: 3,000.

53
00:09:21,553 --> 00:09:23,464
"Powder kegs: 1,500.

54
00:09:24,114 --> 00:09:26,985
"Rounds of musket shot: 65,000.

55
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,249
- "Rounds of cannon shot..."
- Begging thy pardon for interrupting...

56
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:33,744
but when will thee get into the gold?

57
00:09:37,113 --> 00:09:38,674
Listen, fellows, listen.

58
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:42,292
There are islands in these waters
steaming with rebellion against the King...

59
00:09:42,363 --> 00:09:45,299
and kept from boiling over
only for lack of guns.

60
00:09:45,372 --> 00:09:48,024
lslands where guns
are worth more than gold.

61
00:09:48,093 --> 00:09:50,298
- More than diamonds.
- Gunrunning?

62
00:09:50,367 --> 00:09:53,435
But that's not piracy, Skipper.
That's business.

63
00:09:53,504 --> 00:09:57,083
- That means working ashore.
- We're doing poorly enough afloat.

64
00:09:57,601 --> 00:10:00,919
lf we're going to try this new caper,
let's make it a good one.

65
00:10:00,995 --> 00:10:05,699
This cargo will bring 50,000 gold florin
from any rebels worth the name.

66
00:10:05,765 --> 00:10:09,062
- 50,000 florin?
- That's a pretty good take.

67
00:10:09,126 --> 00:10:11,363
Let's put it to the vote. All those in favor...

68
00:10:11,431 --> 00:10:14,083
lf you'll forgive my interrupting, Skipper...

69
00:10:14,152 --> 00:10:16,641
l'd like to think before l vote.

70
00:10:17,002 --> 00:10:20,168
Meantime, we got
regular pirate business to settle.

71
00:10:21,003 --> 00:10:23,852
We got the plank, the culprit,
and the verdict.

72
00:10:23,917 --> 00:10:27,432
All we need's a trial
and execution of a sentence.

73
00:10:27,503 --> 00:10:28,682
He's guilty!

74
00:10:29,008 --> 00:10:31,726
So much for the trial. Now for execution.

75
00:10:32,721 --> 00:10:34,610
Come on. Kill me, you fools.

76
00:10:34,674 --> 00:10:38,931
The King's Navy will scour the Seven Seas
till every one of you is hung high and dry.

77
00:10:38,995 --> 00:10:41,779
- To the plank with him!
- Avast!

78
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,512
There'll be no plank-walking for him.

79
00:10:51,577 --> 00:10:53,880
Forgive my slow-wittedness, Skipper...

80
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:57,723
but are thee asking us to spare
this sweet-smelling toad?

81
00:10:58,332 --> 00:11:00,602
Begging Thy Excellency's pardon.

82
00:11:00,669 --> 00:11:03,704
Your captain's got more brains
than all of you put together.

83
00:11:03,774 --> 00:11:05,880
No doubt you intend
to hold me for ransom.

84
00:11:05,951 --> 00:11:09,302
No, my fine-feathered friend.
l'm setting you free.

85
00:11:10,274 --> 00:11:13,788
l say, if there's no profit in the monkey
we'll have our pleasure.

86
00:11:13,859 --> 00:11:15,868
l say there is profit in him. Alive.

87
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:18,178
- How much profit?
- Now hear me out.

88
00:11:20,454 --> 00:11:23,586
l said 50,000 gold florin
from the rebels for the guns...

89
00:11:23,655 --> 00:11:27,618
and here, by special commission,
is the King's chief rebel-catcher.

90
00:11:28,202 --> 00:11:30,886
So why not another 50,000
from him and his king...

91
00:11:30,955 --> 00:11:33,607
for telling them which rebels
we sell all the guns to.

92
00:11:33,676 --> 00:11:34,756
Eh, Baron?

93
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:37,480
A brilliant scheme, Captain.
My congratulations.

94
00:11:37,549 --> 00:11:39,240
Thy congratulations.

95
00:11:40,014 --> 00:11:43,311
lf thou art for it,
it is not for the good of pirates.

96
00:11:43,376 --> 00:11:45,286
Good? Gentlemen, it's magnificent.

97
00:11:45,361 --> 00:11:49,870
l'm bound for the lsland of Cobra to catch
a man, El Libre, and smash his rebellion.

98
00:11:50,131 --> 00:11:54,060
lf you'll take the guns there, lure him
out of his hole and into my hands...

99
00:11:54,132 --> 00:11:56,556
l'll raise the purse another 50,000.

100
00:11:57,431 --> 00:12:01,360
There it is, lads, in round figures:
150,000 florin.

101
00:12:04,505 --> 00:12:07,125
What do you say now,
Mr. Humble Bellows?

102
00:12:07,674 --> 00:12:10,393
Thy humble servant will believe it...

103
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,665
when thy humble servant sees it.

104
00:12:13,437 --> 00:12:15,740
l take it we have a deal, Captain.

105
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,196
This change of ship, Captain,
most uncomfortable.

106
00:12:49,326 --> 00:12:52,426
My men won't transfer cargo.
Too much like honest work.

107
00:12:52,495 --> 00:12:55,845
Captain Vallo, your men have only left me
headsail and topsail.

108
00:12:55,921 --> 00:12:58,475
They're enough to get you to Cobra
sooner or later.

109
00:12:58,546 --> 00:13:00,619
My ship is faster than this barge.

110
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:04,205
l don't want you making port
before l've got El Libre ready for delivery...

111
00:13:04,276 --> 00:13:06,251
or putting a shot in my backside.

112
00:13:06,325 --> 00:13:09,621
l hope El Libre is not as careful
as you are, Captain.

113
00:13:20,891 --> 00:13:22,801
Cast off helm!

114
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,710
Cast off stern!

115
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:32,633
- Mr. Bellows, make sail!
- Aye, aye, sir!

116
00:13:56,842 --> 00:13:58,567
Haul up, full and by.

117
00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:02,436
Nor' nor' east.
We're heading for the lsle of Cobra.

118
00:14:02,989 --> 00:14:04,965
Come on, you lubbers, move!

119
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:42,589
Hear ye, hear ye!

120
00:14:42,847 --> 00:14:45,881
The King's vessel is now at anchor...

121
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:49,270
in the port of Cobra
with Baron Gruda aboard.

122
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:53,953
Any demonstration
will be regarded as high treason.

123
00:14:55,781 --> 00:14:57,822
The people seem very quiet, don't they?

124
00:14:57,894 --> 00:15:01,278
l don't think they intend to demonstrate
against Baron Gruda after all.

125
00:15:01,351 --> 00:15:03,937
- Apparently not, Governor.
- What a pity.

126
00:15:04,008 --> 00:15:06,497
Our troops could've cut them down
like wheat.

127
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:09,192
Couldn't we shoot a few
on general principles?

128
00:15:09,259 --> 00:15:10,602
Might impress the Baron.

129
00:15:10,668 --> 00:15:12,938
He might feel
you are merely provoking trouble.

130
00:15:13,005 --> 00:15:16,138
Most exasperating.
Fire the salute to Baron Gruda.

131
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,109
Attention!

132
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:36,241
Give the word and l'll dose
those backstabbers with a broadside.

133
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:38,805
They're not firing at us,
you powder-brained ape.

134
00:15:38,872 --> 00:15:42,899
They're giving us a 15-gun salute.
We're flying the flag of Gruda.

135
00:15:42,969 --> 00:15:46,036
Slimey, bring out the flags
and run up that message l gave you.

136
00:15:46,811 --> 00:15:49,365
And, Slimey,
give the Governor my compliments.

137
00:15:49,436 --> 00:15:50,898
The Crimson Pirate's?

138
00:15:50,973 --> 00:15:53,363
No, you oyster-head, Baron Gruda's.

139
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:57,560
Mr. Bellows, keep the rest of these
half-masted monkeys below deck.

140
00:15:57,632 --> 00:15:58,877
Aye, aye, Skipper.

141
00:15:58,945 --> 00:16:01,881
Keep a sharp lookout, lads.
l'll be back with El Libre tonight.

142
00:16:01,954 --> 00:16:03,416
Let's go, Ojo.

143
00:16:10,341 --> 00:16:14,467
There goes a good pirate,
to sell his wares like a fish peddler.

144
00:16:14,985 --> 00:16:17,374
Meaning no disrespect to the Skipper,
of course.

145
00:16:17,449 --> 00:16:19,173
Us with a price on our heads...

146
00:16:19,241 --> 00:16:23,301
holed, too, in one of His Majesty's ports
like sitting ducks.

147
00:16:24,011 --> 00:16:28,236
But if the Skipper pulls us through again,
we'd be the ducks with the golden eggs.

148
00:16:28,301 --> 00:16:31,652
You're thinking of geese,
if you'll pardon the correction, Poison Paul.

149
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,862
Geese on a wild-goose chase.

150
00:16:45,748 --> 00:16:47,157
What do they say, Joseph?

151
00:16:47,223 --> 00:16:50,420
They've got the plague onboard,
and they're quarantining themselves...

152
00:16:50,488 --> 00:16:52,462
until the victims are killed or cured.

153
00:16:53,817 --> 00:16:56,501
We must signal my profound condolences
to Baron Gruda.

154
00:16:56,571 --> 00:16:59,321
- Very well, Governor.
- Maybe it's all for the best, Joseph.

155
00:16:59,388 --> 00:17:01,657
El Libre's followers
may yet show their hands...

156
00:17:01,724 --> 00:17:04,442
and give me a chance to impress
the Baron. Order my carriage.

157
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:08,663
Disperse the crowd. Change the guard,
and double your patrols in the street.

158
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,743
Come on, my popsy-wopsy-wopsies.

159
00:17:22,213 --> 00:17:26,109
Plague, is it? May it take all of them.
Baron Gruda first.

160
00:17:26,534 --> 00:17:29,056
Aye, and if the plague don't, we will.

161
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:34,049
- Who are you?
- Simple fisher folk like yourselves.

162
00:17:34,122 --> 00:17:37,954
Put in for a tankard of ale, a friendly word,
and a chance to fight the King.

163
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,179
Why choose us?

164
00:17:46,769 --> 00:17:48,492
You look and talk like a fighter.

165
00:17:48,946 --> 00:17:50,320
lt takes one to know one.

166
00:17:50,386 --> 00:17:53,005
You may have us marked, all right.
Maybe not.

167
00:17:53,075 --> 00:17:54,985
But we haven't marked you yet.

168
00:17:55,059 --> 00:17:57,395
- We're asking no questions.
- We are.

169
00:17:58,294 --> 00:18:00,782
What l've heard about El Libre
is good enough for me.

170
00:18:00,854 --> 00:18:02,316
Tell us how to contact him.

171
00:18:02,391 --> 00:18:05,808
A man like him would be pleased to have
two more strong-armed lads aboard.

172
00:18:12,827 --> 00:18:14,715
Not very trusting souls, are they?

173
00:18:25,985 --> 00:18:29,118
l guess we'll have to prove
our high regard for El Libre.

174
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,002
Ojo, you took the words
right out of my mouth.

175
00:18:44,073 --> 00:18:46,278
A brawl with the King's men. Let's go.

176
00:18:51,533 --> 00:18:55,332
Left, right. Left. Mark time!

177
00:18:58,096 --> 00:18:59,438
Right turn.

178
00:19:01,329 --> 00:19:02,344
Halt!

179
00:19:04,627 --> 00:19:08,370
Quick march! Forward! Halt! Turn!

180
00:19:17,113 --> 00:19:19,120
Right wheel!

181
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:26,068
March!

182
00:19:28,285 --> 00:19:29,366
Halt!

183
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,987
Present arms!

184
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,747
Long live the republic!

185
00:20:03,822 --> 00:20:05,610
Rebels! Get them!

186
00:20:20,372 --> 00:20:21,779
Long live El Libre!

187
00:20:21,844 --> 00:20:23,187
After them!

188
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:05,249
There they are!

189
00:21:06,728 --> 00:21:08,135
Don't let them get away!

190
00:21:34,901 --> 00:21:36,788
Men! Come on!

191
00:22:42,802 --> 00:22:44,591
Come on! Quick, in that corner.

192
00:22:45,747 --> 00:22:47,177
There they go!

193
00:22:58,617 --> 00:23:00,244
Hurry up. ln back.

194
00:23:02,843 --> 00:23:04,087
This way!

195
00:23:08,574 --> 00:23:09,523
Go ahead.

196
00:23:17,634 --> 00:23:18,747
Pierce the canvas.

197
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,087
Fire!

198
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,412
Ready? Fire!

199
00:23:51,792 --> 00:23:54,641
Pick it up! Lift it up!
Come on. Lift it up! Fire!

200
00:23:58,804 --> 00:23:59,949
Take us away.

201
00:24:02,229 --> 00:24:03,954
They're getting away!

202
00:24:21,502 --> 00:24:23,925
Latch the cellars! Block the alley!

203
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,223
Look out. Soldiers.

204
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:47,297
Just a minute.

205
00:24:57,134 --> 00:24:58,444
Search the place.

206
00:25:55,463 --> 00:25:58,279
- The stink would drive away a pig.
- Which it did.

207
00:25:59,785 --> 00:26:01,412
Watch that door.

208
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:09,638
You've saved us, lad, you've saved us.

209
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:11,466
We're among our own kind.

210
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:13,929
Rebels.

211
00:26:14,223 --> 00:26:16,592
Wouldn't surprise me
if you were El Libre himself.

212
00:26:16,817 --> 00:26:20,167
- You look like a born leader of men.
- The name's Pablo Murphy.

213
00:26:20,242 --> 00:26:23,888
And l got enough lrish from me father
to know blarney when l hear it.

214
00:26:23,988 --> 00:26:26,672
We'd have slit your throats
for snooping spies by now...

215
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,498
only for what you did to them soldiers.

216
00:26:28,567 --> 00:26:30,574
- Who are they?
- Who knows?

217
00:26:30,647 --> 00:26:33,037
This one can't talk
and this one can't keep quiet.

218
00:26:33,112 --> 00:26:36,409
All right, let's get to the point.
l'm Captain Vallo at your service.

219
00:26:36,474 --> 00:26:38,133
And this is Lieutenant Ojo.

220
00:26:41,244 --> 00:26:43,415
Vallo? The pirate?

221
00:26:43,484 --> 00:26:44,980
The Crimson Pirate?

222
00:26:45,053 --> 00:26:48,022
That's right, sweet mother,
with a bargain for El Libre...

223
00:26:48,095 --> 00:26:50,168
a shipload of powder shot and musketry.

224
00:26:50,238 --> 00:26:52,541
- Baron Gruda's ship.
- Baron Gruda's ship?

225
00:26:52,609 --> 00:26:54,911
Aye. Baron Gruda's own 30-gunner.

226
00:26:55,426 --> 00:26:58,296
We took her as easy as you'd take
a mackerel, fine fishermen.

227
00:26:58,371 --> 00:27:00,544
Easier. For we used dead bait.

228
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,970
You killed Baron Gruda?

229
00:27:04,165 --> 00:27:07,036
lf l did that you wouldn't need the guns
l want to sell you.

230
00:27:07,111 --> 00:27:09,381
l'm a pirate, not a dog killer.

231
00:27:09,447 --> 00:27:11,869
But l like you lads. l like your style.

232
00:27:11,944 --> 00:27:13,767
So gather round and get this:

233
00:27:13,834 --> 00:27:17,611
The Baron will arrive in port
aboard my own ship in a matter of days.

234
00:27:17,676 --> 00:27:21,452
So how about taking me to El Libre
so we can close the deal for the guns?

235
00:27:21,517 --> 00:27:23,341
Time and tide, you know.

236
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:45,295
Wash the stink off them
and take them below.

237
00:27:45,368 --> 00:27:46,710
Pass the word along.

238
00:28:07,233 --> 00:28:10,104
When it's dark,
we'll take them to the small boat...

239
00:28:10,179 --> 00:28:12,319
and row them out to their ship.
Come with me.

240
00:28:24,777 --> 00:28:26,403
Now, you know what the plan is.

241
00:28:26,474 --> 00:28:28,744
The rest will join my lads
at the fishing boats...

242
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:31,299
and stand by the pirate vessel
to receive the guns.

243
00:28:31,372 --> 00:28:33,445
Suppose the pirates
refuse to give them up?

244
00:28:33,516 --> 00:28:36,201
l'll keep my knife at Captain Vallo's throat.

245
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:38,922
Either he'll give the order
to hand over the guns...

246
00:28:38,991 --> 00:28:41,032
or he'll never give another order.

247
00:28:41,104 --> 00:28:44,171
You're cutting our throats,
Pablo Murphy, not his.

248
00:28:47,603 --> 00:28:50,092
l like your nerve, Pablo, but not your plan.

249
00:28:50,164 --> 00:28:54,127
l say we've got to get the guns and take
the palace before Baron Gruda gets here.

250
00:28:54,198 --> 00:28:57,712
And l say we need more than guns.
We need El Libre to lead us.

251
00:28:57,783 --> 00:29:00,468
You women won't face facts.
El Libre's been captured.

252
00:29:00,537 --> 00:29:02,361
The way to face facts is to rescue him.

253
00:29:02,426 --> 00:29:04,881
Rescue him?
From the King's prison? lmpossible.

254
00:29:06,523 --> 00:29:10,518
Not for a desperate man
with a 30-gunner and a fighting crew.

255
00:29:11,005 --> 00:29:13,145
A pirate rescue for El Libre?

256
00:29:13,406 --> 00:29:16,669
That'd be taking him from the frying pan
and throwing him into the fire.

257
00:29:16,735 --> 00:29:19,103
- We'll handle this our own way.
- About face!

258
00:29:19,169 --> 00:29:20,281
Get over here.

259
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,024
There's a meeting! The door, quick!

260
00:30:18,939 --> 00:30:20,347
Out! The other door!

261
00:30:40,709 --> 00:30:43,198
lf l release you, can l count on your help?

262
00:30:44,838 --> 00:30:46,366
You'll be well paid.

263
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:05,708
You misjudged our men.

264
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,917
Don't misjudge our women.

265
00:31:09,361 --> 00:31:10,922
- Another door here.
- Where?

266
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,303
Follow me.

267
00:31:54,949 --> 00:31:58,333
- What's all the shooting?
- The Skipper coming back from market.

268
00:31:58,407 --> 00:32:01,059
l have a feeling we'll be putting out to sea.

269
00:32:01,128 --> 00:32:04,806
Hoist anchor. Man all canvas. Look lively!

270
00:32:04,969 --> 00:32:06,881
Man the yards!

271
00:32:11,277 --> 00:32:12,521
Prepare to fire!

272
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,764
Fire one!

273
00:32:27,476 --> 00:32:28,721
Fire two!

274
00:32:43,322 --> 00:32:47,765
Signal Baron Gruda's ship for a broadside.
One of us can knock her out of the water.

275
00:33:08,166 --> 00:33:11,582
Shore battery's asking for a broadside
against them, Mr. Bellows.

276
00:33:11,655 --> 00:33:14,045
What are you waiting for, drooling idiot?

277
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:17,471
- Give 'em a broadside!
- Aye, aye, sir! One broadside coming up!

278
00:33:35,634 --> 00:33:37,545
Good shooting, lads. Well aimed.

279
00:33:38,035 --> 00:33:40,458
Skipper, be that
what thou bought at market?

280
00:33:42,164 --> 00:33:44,403
Take the lady below
and make her comfortable.

281
00:33:47,992 --> 00:33:49,650
Thank you, Captain.

282
00:33:52,377 --> 00:33:54,385
The gallant Captain Vallo, eh, lads?

283
00:33:59,869 --> 00:34:02,008
Be that bit of fluff El Libre?

284
00:34:02,077 --> 00:34:04,183
That's the bit of fluff
that's taking us to him.

285
00:34:04,254 --> 00:34:08,249
He's being held on the lsland of San Perot,
only a day's sailing from here.

286
00:34:09,569 --> 00:34:11,609
Who's holding him for us, Skipper?

287
00:34:11,682 --> 00:34:16,058
The King's troop. ln the military prison.
Now, what could be sweeter, lads?

288
00:34:16,131 --> 00:34:19,810
We'll steal him from the King's men,
and sell him back to a king's man.

289
00:34:20,869 --> 00:34:24,549
- But be thou seriously planning to...
- Walk us into a king's prison?

290
00:34:24,616 --> 00:34:27,432
Why, not at all, Humble Bellows, not at all.

291
00:34:27,817 --> 00:34:29,922
Gather round, lads, gather round!

292
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:19,286
- My, my, what a pretty knife.
- Would you like a closer look?

293
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:21,942
Let's keep this pot
looking like a ship of the line!

294
00:35:22,561 --> 00:35:23,991
Come up here.

295
00:35:29,156 --> 00:35:30,335
Hop to it!

296
00:35:38,312 --> 00:35:40,550
l came up to talk about El Libre.

297
00:35:45,483 --> 00:35:48,484
- Go ahead. l'm listening.
- You have a plan to save him?

298
00:35:49,069 --> 00:35:52,070
A plan and a price.
Guns alone will cost 50,000.

299
00:35:52,142 --> 00:35:55,886
That's a great deal of money for guns.
How much are you asking for El Libre?

300
00:35:56,879 --> 00:35:58,473
Oh, yes, El Libre.

301
00:35:59,217 --> 00:36:00,744
l'll throw him in for nothing.

302
00:36:02,194 --> 00:36:03,656
Very well, Captain.

303
00:36:03,731 --> 00:36:06,099
l'll see that the money
is arranged with him.

304
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,588
You may be sure
that he'll honor the agreement.

305
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:10,805
What's your plan?

306
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,492
Why did you bolt
your cabin door last night?

307
00:36:17,753 --> 00:36:20,373
lf you know it was bolted,
you must've tried it.

308
00:36:20,507 --> 00:36:22,896
And if you tried it,
you know why it was bolted.

309
00:36:25,821 --> 00:36:27,764
How do you propose to get El Libre?

310
00:36:28,317 --> 00:36:30,228
ls your door open only to him?

311
00:36:31,487 --> 00:36:32,634
What do you mean?

312
00:36:32,705 --> 00:36:36,186
So much concern about one man
can't be entirely political.

313
00:36:36,705 --> 00:36:38,232
He's your lover.

314
00:36:38,721 --> 00:36:39,737
No.

315
00:36:40,451 --> 00:36:41,946
He's my father.

316
00:36:43,652 --> 00:36:44,896
Captain!

317
00:36:49,255 --> 00:36:50,662
Land ho!

318
00:37:06,382 --> 00:37:08,772
On your feet, lads. Attention!

319
00:37:14,195 --> 00:37:16,749
You're supposed to be king's men,
not bard slabs.

320
00:37:16,947 --> 00:37:19,053
Look like you belong in those uniforms.

321
00:37:31,385 --> 00:37:34,485
Ojo, signal to the garrison
that Baron Gruda has arrived...

322
00:37:34,842 --> 00:37:36,469
to take El Libre into custody.

323
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:51,513
- What about my father?
- l ordered you to stay below.

324
00:37:53,795 --> 00:37:55,684
What are they signaling?

325
00:37:57,541 --> 00:38:00,892
The garrison commander wishes
to give a dinner in honor of Baron Gruda.

326
00:38:01,799 --> 00:38:03,688
What are we going to do?

327
00:38:04,905 --> 00:38:07,208
We're going to accept, of course.

328
00:38:43,514 --> 00:38:45,303
Baron Gruda and his bit of fluff...

329
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:48,438
left enough clothes onboard
to fool the King himself.

330
00:38:48,508 --> 00:38:50,035
lf anyone recognizes us...

331
00:38:50,108 --> 00:38:53,142
we'll be stripping for action
and taking El Libre the hard way.

332
00:39:00,673 --> 00:39:03,641
A fine body of men, Captain.
A fine body of men.

333
00:39:35,856 --> 00:39:39,687
His Excellency Baron Gruda and party.

334
00:39:55,737 --> 00:39:57,526
Welcome, Your Excellency.

335
00:39:57,593 --> 00:40:00,890
lt is a great honor for all of us
to meet you at last.

336
00:40:00,955 --> 00:40:03,859
lt gives us great pleasure
that you accept our hospitality.

337
00:40:03,932 --> 00:40:06,683
On the contrary, my dear Colonel,
it is l who am accepted.

338
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:09,566
Oh, no, Your Excellency.
l am the lucky one.

339
00:40:10,367 --> 00:40:14,625
l had instructions from the Governor
of Cobra to execute El Libre.

340
00:40:15,363 --> 00:40:18,266
l was on the verge of doing so
when l got your message.

341
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:21,123
The Governor is an idiot!
l may replace him...

342
00:40:22,373 --> 00:40:23,650
with a military man.

343
00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:27,262
- My dear Baron.
- My dear Colonel.

344
00:40:32,617 --> 00:40:35,684
- May l introduce you to our guests?
- By all means.

345
00:40:46,384 --> 00:40:48,718
- Your Excellency.
- Your Excellency.

346
00:41:14,653 --> 00:41:18,003
But l have so much trouble
collecting the King's taxes here.

347
00:41:18,078 --> 00:41:20,981
Tell me, Count.
How do the people pay at home?

348
00:41:24,257 --> 00:41:26,909
Through the nose!
They pay through the nose!

349
00:41:28,546 --> 00:41:30,303
That's really very good!

350
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:36,480
How long do we have to play this game?

351
00:41:38,373 --> 00:41:40,862
Till the Colonel decides
to hand over El Libre.

352
00:41:40,935 --> 00:41:42,463
l am frightened.

353
00:42:06,163 --> 00:42:08,269
The Count must be
a constant delight to you.

354
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,545
He's really too funny for words.

355
00:42:10,613 --> 00:42:11,758
lndeed he is.

356
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:13,139
Do tell us, Count.

357
00:42:13,205 --> 00:42:16,468
What does the Queen wear
when she goes out these days?

358
00:42:18,584 --> 00:42:21,432
The Count always says
the Queen wears the King out.

359
00:42:21,817 --> 00:42:23,640
You are the wittiest man!

360
00:42:26,748 --> 00:42:30,262
Ladies and gentlemen,
may l have your attention, please.

361
00:42:31,485 --> 00:42:35,349
To commemorate the honor
Baron Gruda has done us by his visit...

362
00:42:35,808 --> 00:42:40,316
the officers of the Saint Theo garrison
have arranged a little gift for him.

363
00:42:41,507 --> 00:42:43,963
Will everyone come this way, please?

364
00:42:58,058 --> 00:42:59,138
On the left...

365
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:03,684
you have that great lover of democracy
and the people, El Libre.

366
00:43:04,141 --> 00:43:07,208
And on the right,
that distinguished scientist...

367
00:43:07,278 --> 00:43:09,220
Professor Prudence.

368
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:12,205
Both caught like rats in a trap...

369
00:43:12,399 --> 00:43:16,427
conspiring against the greater glory
of His Majesty.

370
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:20,335
But thanks to statesmen
like Baron Gruda...

371
00:43:20,851 --> 00:43:25,163
such men and such ideas
will soon be destroyed.

372
00:43:26,071 --> 00:43:27,729
As a distinguished scientist...

373
00:43:27,799 --> 00:43:32,079
l can assure you an idea has no physical
properties which can be destroyed.

374
00:43:32,154 --> 00:43:34,969
As a lover of democracy and the people,
l can assure you...

375
00:43:35,035 --> 00:43:37,337
both will survive your puny efforts.

376
00:43:38,556 --> 00:43:42,005
As a statesman, l can assure you
that no one can foretell the future.

377
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:45,493
However, your fate at present
is as clear to me...

378
00:43:46,078 --> 00:43:48,567
as the face of this beautiful lady
at my side.

379
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:50,014
Bravo!

380
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:52,699
Thank you, Your Excellency.

381
00:43:57,091 --> 00:43:59,961
Yes. She is very beautiful.

382
00:44:01,445 --> 00:44:03,235
His Excellency has a point.

383
00:44:03,302 --> 00:44:07,198
lt's foolish to quarrel with fate
when ours is so clearly in his hands.

384
00:44:08,711 --> 00:44:12,543
Take them outside and hold them
for Baron Gruda's pleasure.

385
00:44:17,197 --> 00:44:20,547
My dear Colonel, thank you
for a most rewarding evening.

386
00:44:20,622 --> 00:44:23,493
- And now we must go.
- lt is by no means over.

387
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:26,186
l've arranged
a very special entertainment...

388
00:44:26,256 --> 00:44:28,265
for this very special occasion.

389
00:44:49,946 --> 00:44:52,020
lt's that dame we held for ransom.

390
00:45:02,592 --> 00:45:03,673
Abandon ship.

391
00:45:03,746 --> 00:45:06,649
- Thank you, my dear Colonel.
- Your Excellency!

392
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:10,620
- But, my dear Baron!
- Wonderful evening, Colonel.

393
00:45:10,692 --> 00:45:11,772
Vallo!

394
00:45:17,639 --> 00:45:18,818
But, Your Excellency.

395
00:45:18,888 --> 00:45:22,435
Unexpected international affairs.
Happens to us diplomats all the time.

396
00:45:26,539 --> 00:45:28,907
- Put the prisoners in my carriage.
- Aye, aye, sir.

397
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:39,272
l do hope the King will hear about this,
Your Excellency.

398
00:45:39,344 --> 00:45:40,654
Don't worry, he will.

399
00:45:42,097 --> 00:45:44,913
Unclutch me, you polluted shrimp.

400
00:45:47,635 --> 00:45:49,360
Stop him, you fools!

401
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:51,823
He's the Crimson Pirate!

402
00:45:51,894 --> 00:45:53,553
The Crimson Pirate?

403
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:04,022
The Crimson Pirate!

404
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:07,955
Take the Colonel to safety. Quick, man.

405
00:46:09,854 --> 00:46:13,052
- Take the Colonel to safety!
- Let me go, you fools!

406
00:46:14,208 --> 00:46:16,827
Don't worry, Colonel.
l'll take care of everything!

407
00:46:16,896 --> 00:46:19,865
- Citizen Ravel, save the Count!
- Save the Count!

408
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:31,006
- Sire! Sire!
- Good work, Captain.

409
00:46:31,271 --> 00:46:33,825
Stop him! There's the Crimson Pirate!

410
00:46:34,408 --> 00:46:35,619
Captain!

411
00:46:37,258 --> 00:46:39,398
The officers are mutinying. Crush them!

412
00:46:40,652 --> 00:46:42,343
Crush them! Come on!

413
00:46:43,886 --> 00:46:45,195
Sound the attack!

414
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:51,754
Hold the fort. Don't give an inch.
Protect the women and children.

415
00:46:51,825 --> 00:46:54,673
Reinforcements are on the way.
Lock the gates! Let no one out.

416
00:46:54,738 --> 00:46:56,648
Lock the gates! Let no one out!

417
00:46:56,723 --> 00:46:59,888
Long live the King!

418
00:47:03,957 --> 00:47:06,511
l don't think we've met.
My name is Prudence.

419
00:47:06,583 --> 00:47:08,723
Captain Vallo, at your service.

420
00:47:10,776 --> 00:47:12,054
Thank you.

421
00:47:43,143 --> 00:47:45,053
What are you grinning at?

422
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:52,899
So, l'm getting a halo.
You're afraid l'm getting soft.

423
00:47:53,707 --> 00:47:55,366
Yeah, you're wrong.

424
00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:00,968
lt's just that this is a new kind of caper.
These people are getting on my nerves.

425
00:48:01,551 --> 00:48:03,820
El Libre and his daughter
are strictly business.

426
00:48:05,392 --> 00:48:08,558
They haven't got me chained.
l've got them chained.

427
00:48:09,234 --> 00:48:11,275
l'll be rid of them soon enough.

428
00:48:11,347 --> 00:48:14,031
Tomorrow, l'm delivering them
to Baron Gruda personally.

429
00:48:15,285 --> 00:48:16,944
What are you talking about?

430
00:48:41,825 --> 00:48:43,069
The girl?

431
00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:48,768
What about the girl?

432
00:48:52,678 --> 00:48:54,304
She's getting under my skin.

433
00:48:55,399 --> 00:48:57,374
She's putting crazy ideas in my head.

434
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:02,115
She's unlocked my heart.
She's getting too close to me.

435
00:49:03,562 --> 00:49:04,937
She's got me hooked.

436
00:49:06,989 --> 00:49:08,331
She's blind.

437
00:49:09,453 --> 00:49:11,396
l'm blind. You're blind.

438
00:49:12,302 --> 00:49:13,579
Who's blind?

439
00:49:16,785 --> 00:49:18,378
Oh! Love is blind.

440
00:49:20,178 --> 00:49:21,739
l am not in love!

441
00:50:06,854 --> 00:50:08,196
Avast there!

442
00:50:09,896 --> 00:50:13,094
l told you not to make so much noise.
Now the Skipper will get her.

443
00:50:13,161 --> 00:50:15,201
- He always does.
- Nobody will get her.

444
00:50:22,189 --> 00:50:23,782
Untie the others. Move!

445
00:50:23,853 --> 00:50:25,578
What's up? l'm having a little fun.

446
00:50:25,646 --> 00:50:28,996
- Come on, Skipper. Let us have some fun.
- You want her all to yourself?

447
00:50:29,072 --> 00:50:32,140
- Why don't you join the fun?
- Why don't you try yourself?

448
00:50:32,210 --> 00:50:35,724
- You always tell that you couldn't make it.
- Always work and no fun.

449
00:50:48,313 --> 00:50:51,729
Mr. Bellows, take all three below
and bring me the cabin keys.

450
00:50:51,866 --> 00:50:54,355
lf you'll forgive
my pointing it out, Skipper...

451
00:50:54,427 --> 00:50:57,658
we can't leave a pretty woman
unmolested aboard ship.

452
00:50:58,077 --> 00:51:00,282
lt will give piracy a bad name.

453
00:51:00,414 --> 00:51:02,170
Are you challenging my orders?

454
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:05,946
l'd never do that, Skipper...

455
00:51:06,209 --> 00:51:10,007
but seeing thou is selling these pigeons
to Baron Gruda anyway...

456
00:51:10,082 --> 00:51:13,727
l thought there could be no harm
to sport with them a bit first.

457
00:51:15,333 --> 00:51:17,024
No offense, Skipper.

458
00:51:31,372 --> 00:51:34,407
l'm putting you ashore tomorrow at Cobra
and giving you the guns.

459
00:51:35,469 --> 00:51:36,779
All of you.

460
00:51:38,415 --> 00:51:40,106
Just don't thank me.

461
00:52:17,567 --> 00:52:18,746
Skipper.

462
00:52:27,493 --> 00:52:30,527
Yes, there's our ship.
With Baron Gruda waiting.

463
00:52:30,982 --> 00:52:32,837
Won't he hate paying for El Libre...

464
00:52:32,902 --> 00:52:36,483
when he finds out we stole him
out of one of the King's own prisons?

465
00:52:39,465 --> 00:52:43,112
- We'll heave to onto the point till nightfall.
- Aye, aye, Skipper.

466
00:52:47,917 --> 00:52:49,063
Slimey.

467
00:52:58,770 --> 00:53:02,862
- Let's see thee swim to yonder island.
- Aye, and back again.

468
00:53:03,315 --> 00:53:06,962
lf my plan works,
Baron Gruda himself will escort thee back.

469
00:53:07,413 --> 00:53:09,389
l've a message for thee to give to him.

470
00:53:09,783 --> 00:53:12,337
Do it, and when l am skipper...

471
00:53:12,536 --> 00:53:14,196
thou wilt be first mate.

472
00:53:17,499 --> 00:53:18,928
Mr. Bellows...

473
00:53:20,892 --> 00:53:23,894
- what about sharks?
- They never attack a man.

474
00:53:24,541 --> 00:53:26,647
Unless he attacks them first.

475
00:53:37,026 --> 00:53:38,717
- Governor.
- Baron?

476
00:53:39,396 --> 00:53:42,878
- Send him to the kitchen and feed him.
- Kitchen. Feed him.

477
00:53:45,959 --> 00:53:48,381
You'll have the 100,000 gold florin
ready for them.

478
00:53:48,456 --> 00:53:50,627
Whatever Your Excellency orders.

479
00:53:50,696 --> 00:53:54,310
- But this is sheer piracy.
- l assure you...

480
00:53:54,443 --> 00:53:57,958
l shall have El Libre, his daughter,
his distinguished conspirator...

481
00:53:58,029 --> 00:54:02,253
our ship, our guns, the pirates,
and Captain Vallo, without paying a sou.

482
00:54:02,510 --> 00:54:05,545
- Then why 100,000?
- Have the money ready, l said.

483
00:54:07,345 --> 00:54:11,121
The first mate thinks he can undo Vallo,
but his plan may fail.

484
00:54:11,922 --> 00:54:15,371
Even if we have to pay, such a haul
would be cheap at double the price.

485
00:54:15,443 --> 00:54:16,851
By the way...

486
00:54:17,333 --> 00:54:20,465
l shall want a barrel of this, well drugged.

487
00:54:28,505 --> 00:54:30,513
- You disposed of Captain Vallo?
- No.

488
00:54:30,586 --> 00:54:33,555
lt will be necessary to expose him
to the crew first.

489
00:54:33,628 --> 00:54:37,458
Which l'll be doing soon enough,
if thou has followed my instructions.

490
00:54:37,532 --> 00:54:38,962
To the letter.

491
00:54:39,294 --> 00:54:42,079
And the money?
lf you'll forgive my impatience.

492
00:54:42,144 --> 00:54:44,217
lt will be waiting for you in the morning.

493
00:54:44,289 --> 00:54:47,421
Meanwhile, l place myself in your hands
as security for it.

494
00:54:47,489 --> 00:54:48,800
Very well.

495
00:54:48,867 --> 00:54:52,316
But l remind thee, they be murderous
hands when they're empty.

496
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:55,845
Hide His Excellency below.

497
00:55:25,970 --> 00:55:29,747
As soon as it's clear topside,
Ojo will stand by below with a small boat.

498
00:55:29,812 --> 00:55:32,684
lt's a short pull to shore. Call your father.

499
00:56:04,931 --> 00:56:07,267
Come with us. Join us.

500
00:56:09,253 --> 00:56:10,236
No.

501
00:56:12,006 --> 00:56:14,789
But you want to. l know you want to.

502
00:56:15,912 --> 00:56:17,319
You're wrong.

503
00:56:18,153 --> 00:56:21,025
There's nothing in it for me.
Get your father.

504
00:56:25,613 --> 00:56:27,588
Then why are you setting us free?

505
00:56:27,662 --> 00:56:30,925
- l keep my promises, even foolish ones.
- You made no promise.

506
00:56:30,991 --> 00:56:33,960
You made a deal to sell us,
and you can't do it.

507
00:56:34,256 --> 00:56:37,935
All right, then. l'm doing it for you.
Let's leave it at that.

508
00:56:38,898 --> 00:56:41,649
No, Vallo. We can't leave it at that.

509
00:56:42,356 --> 00:56:44,594
You're a fighter. Fight with us.

510
00:56:45,142 --> 00:56:47,477
- Fight for something decent.
- Not l.

511
00:56:48,055 --> 00:56:51,984
All my life l've watched injustice
and dishonesty fly the flag of decency.

512
00:56:52,056 --> 00:56:54,807
- l don't trust them.
- Don't you trust me?

513
00:56:57,723 --> 00:57:00,506
Don't you trust what we have
for each other?

514
00:57:00,636 --> 00:57:03,768
What we have for each other
we'll have to get over.

515
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:07,225
Can we?

516
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:27,142
You're right. l won't let you go.

517
00:57:28,073 --> 00:57:31,751
We belong together here,
aboard my ship. We'll find a way.

518
00:57:33,932 --> 00:57:35,273
But that's not possible.

519
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:40,423
- l can't stay here. Don't you see?
- Yes, l see.

520
00:57:41,775 --> 00:57:44,012
And now, at last, you see it, too.

521
00:57:44,848 --> 00:57:47,532
You've got your world, and l've got mine.

522
00:57:52,659 --> 00:57:54,383
All right, gentlemen.

523
00:57:57,782 --> 00:57:58,993
Sit down.

524
00:58:00,951 --> 00:58:03,702
Professor, you'll go ashore later
with Pablo Murphy and the guns.

525
00:58:03,768 --> 00:58:06,453
- Right.
- Keep talking to yourself, loudly.

526
00:58:06,553 --> 00:58:08,921
l want my men to think
you're all still here.

527
00:58:08,987 --> 00:58:10,896
That's no problem for me.

528
00:58:11,099 --> 00:58:13,718
Now, remember, this is a dangerous game.

529
00:58:13,852 --> 00:58:17,236
lf my men tumble to it,
they'll slit your throats, and mine, too.

530
00:58:17,310 --> 00:58:19,199
l don't like it, Captain.

531
00:58:19,647 --> 00:58:22,997
We can't leave you to face them alone.
Come with us.

532
00:58:24,034 --> 00:58:25,244
Father...

533
00:58:25,761 --> 00:58:26,743
don't.

534
00:59:11,766 --> 00:59:13,457
Avast! Man the guns!

535
00:59:20,922 --> 00:59:22,580
Topside, you swabs!

536
00:59:36,418 --> 00:59:37,498
Help!

537
00:59:42,885 --> 00:59:46,115
Not so fast, Skipper,
if you'll pardon the intrusion.

538
01:00:05,741 --> 01:00:09,125
You've sold me, Humble Bellows,
and to a king's flunky.

539
01:00:09,199 --> 01:00:10,214
Aye.

540
01:00:10,704 --> 01:00:14,251
'Tis my modest opinion
that no man can fly pirate's colors...

541
01:00:14,322 --> 01:00:18,185
who's not willing to sell his friend,
his sweetheart, or his mother.

542
01:00:18,259 --> 01:00:21,131
- Well spoken, Mr. Bellows.
- Foul spoken it is.

543
01:00:21,493 --> 01:00:23,950
You've turned your hand
against your Captain's back.

544
01:00:24,023 --> 01:00:26,031
Yellow was never a pirate's color.

545
01:00:26,136 --> 01:00:28,853
Nor rescuing a fair maiden a pirate caper.

546
01:00:29,625 --> 01:00:30,640
Aye.

547
01:00:31,418 --> 01:00:34,070
lt's true. l sailed beyond my depth...

548
01:00:35,515 --> 01:00:38,265
but only to sound out new waters
for the lot of us.

549
01:00:38,332 --> 01:00:42,393
lf we'd have starved to death,
l'd have never sold a man jack of you.

550
01:00:44,670 --> 01:00:48,447
Gather round, lads.
This isn't the last of the pirate capers.

551
01:00:48,513 --> 01:00:51,197
'Tis the last of thee and of thy capers...

552
01:00:51,618 --> 01:00:55,744
for 'twas put to the vote whilst thee
was trying to deprive us of our loot.

553
01:00:55,843 --> 01:00:59,707
Ye violated the pirate code
by letting a fat fish off the hook.

554
01:01:00,966 --> 01:01:03,782
By vote of all,
ye are deprived of command...

555
01:01:04,168 --> 01:01:08,260
and sentenced under piratical law
to be cast adrift in a small boat...

556
01:01:08,905 --> 01:01:10,696
without food or water.

557
01:01:13,228 --> 01:01:17,124
A splendid decision, Mr. Bellows.
Quick justice and certain death.

558
01:01:17,934 --> 01:01:22,091
Perhaps you'd save the King the expense
of hanging this learned fool...

559
01:01:22,255 --> 01:01:24,166
and let him keep Captain Vallo company.

560
01:01:25,393 --> 01:01:27,434
Thou hast a generous choice.

561
01:01:27,730 --> 01:01:29,554
The gallows or the sea.

562
01:01:37,589 --> 01:01:39,379
lf it won't crowd you.

563
01:01:41,273 --> 01:01:44,754
l'd rather you weren't coming,
but l don't want to seem inhospitable.

564
01:01:46,426 --> 01:01:47,856
As for thee...

565
01:01:49,179 --> 01:01:52,824
since l have no voice to raise against
thy Captain's misdemeanors...

566
01:01:52,893 --> 01:01:56,472
thee will be pardoned by giving thy hand
to thy new skipper.

567
01:01:56,767 --> 01:01:59,933
What say thee? Shall we loose thy bonds?

568
01:02:11,141 --> 01:02:12,572
Cut him loose.

569
01:02:46,870 --> 01:02:49,652
lt's done, Skipper. We set them adrift.

570
01:02:50,135 --> 01:02:52,852
The morning tide
will take them out to sea.

571
01:03:02,557 --> 01:03:05,689
Wait! This calls for a celebration,
eh, Mr. Bellows?

572
01:03:06,078 --> 01:03:09,909
l've a keg of rum aboard my boat.
Straight from the Governor's own cellar.

573
01:03:09,983 --> 01:03:11,194
What say?

574
01:03:12,736 --> 01:03:13,751
Aye.

575
01:03:14,144 --> 01:03:15,574
l could use a drink.

576
01:03:15,969 --> 01:03:18,305
Come on, lads! Get the rum aboard.

577
01:03:21,636 --> 01:03:23,971
Bring mine to the Captain's cabin.

578
01:03:29,767 --> 01:03:32,638
There's the end of land.
The end of our world.

579
01:03:32,777 --> 01:03:35,397
From now on, it's starve, thirst,
and finally capsize.

580
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:38,314
l've been meditating on just that.

581
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:42,695
Capsizing is the solution of our problem.
There's no doubt about it.

582
01:03:43,822 --> 01:03:46,376
- lf you'll follow me, please.
- Sit down, you fool!

583
01:03:49,617 --> 01:03:51,024
Sit down, you...

584
01:04:21,438 --> 01:04:22,649
lt works.

585
01:04:24,289 --> 01:04:25,947
Good old Aristotle.

586
01:04:26,016 --> 01:04:28,286
Over 2,000 years ago, he wrote:

587
01:04:28,354 --> 01:04:32,065
"A metallic vessel will retain air
underwater without filling."

588
01:04:32,132 --> 01:04:34,719
But l myself have done some research
on the subject...

589
01:04:34,789 --> 01:04:38,085
while designing a craft
which l call an undersea boat.

590
01:04:38,149 --> 01:04:41,828
- How did you know this was airtight?
- ln science, my son...

591
01:04:42,375 --> 01:04:44,995
one knows nothing until one experiments.

592
01:04:46,185 --> 01:04:48,903
We may now conclude
that we are breathing.

593
01:04:49,066 --> 01:04:51,434
Let us walk ashore as quickly as possible.

594
01:04:51,499 --> 01:04:54,849
l compute there's sufficient air
to last us several minutes.

595
01:04:54,925 --> 01:04:57,708
Providing we don't waste
our oxygen talking, of course.

596
01:04:57,774 --> 01:05:00,196
- All right, then. Shut up!
- Quite so.

597
01:07:02,725 --> 01:07:06,622
You needn't have brought out
the whole garrison. l did the job myself.

598
01:07:06,696 --> 01:07:09,314
They won't be so playful
when they wake up this time.

599
01:07:09,384 --> 01:07:11,273
All right. Wake them up.

600
01:07:11,529 --> 01:07:13,635
Sober them up
and take them to the pirate ship.

601
01:07:13,706 --> 01:07:15,397
Over the side with them!

602
01:07:43,063 --> 01:07:45,912
Sorry l be for this, mates.
And l humbly apologize.

603
01:07:45,977 --> 01:07:48,662
'Twould never have happened
with Vallo as skipper.

604
01:07:48,954 --> 01:07:51,825
He violated a pirate code
and he had to go.

605
01:07:52,219 --> 01:07:55,352
But he went like a pirate.
We're going like fish.

606
01:07:55,421 --> 01:07:57,975
l can't forgive myself for that.

607
01:07:59,230 --> 01:08:02,362
King's flunky made a monkey
of Humble Bellows.

608
01:08:02,719 --> 01:08:05,437
- Pirate of the old school.
- Enough of that!

609
01:08:05,504 --> 01:08:06,814
Hoist them!

610
01:08:12,613 --> 01:08:15,166
Put a crew aboard this ship
and have her re-canvased.

611
01:08:15,237 --> 01:08:17,758
l want her ready to sail when l leave.

612
01:08:18,022 --> 01:08:21,439
Give them just enough bread
and water to keep them alive.

613
01:08:21,512 --> 01:08:24,230
They'll fetch a good bounty from the King.

614
01:08:57,880 --> 01:08:59,539
Ahoy. Pablo Murphy.

615
01:09:01,113 --> 01:09:03,416
- Well, l'll be...
- Get us out of these chains.

616
01:09:03,482 --> 01:09:06,549
After all you got us into,
you lying blabbermouth?

617
01:09:06,619 --> 01:09:08,442
Get yourself out of it.

618
01:09:20,738 --> 01:09:23,805
- Pablo Murphy.
- For the last time, get away from us.

619
01:09:24,293 --> 01:09:26,781
Get it through that head of yours,
l didn't sell El Libre.

620
01:09:26,853 --> 01:09:29,604
- Let me assure...
- We can see for ourselves what he's done.

621
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:32,289
lf we'd gone my way,
El Libre wouldn't be dead.

622
01:09:32,359 --> 01:09:34,532
Consuelo wouldn't be held captive
in the palace...

623
01:09:34,601 --> 01:09:37,449
and we'd have guns to stop Gruda's men
from crushing us.

624
01:09:37,514 --> 01:09:39,619
Hold it, gentlemen. Soldiers.

625
01:09:48,365 --> 01:09:52,558
By order of Baron Gruda, all fishing
will be done under armed escort.

626
01:09:52,784 --> 01:09:55,086
The entire catch to be turned over
to the Governor.

627
01:09:55,152 --> 01:09:57,292
- What'll be left for us?
- The bait.

628
01:09:57,617 --> 01:09:59,407
ln that case, we'll do no fishing.

629
01:10:01,491 --> 01:10:03,184
Any more objections?

630
01:10:04,341 --> 01:10:07,342
The rest of you proceed
to the Governor's dock. Get moving!

631
01:10:08,728 --> 01:10:10,638
Take him to the fortress.

632
01:10:24,895 --> 01:10:26,105
This way.

633
01:11:07,024 --> 01:11:09,960
- Hey, there, back in line.
- Follow those boats.

634
01:11:43,233 --> 01:11:44,543
After them!

635
01:13:03,012 --> 01:13:04,223
Let's go.

636
01:13:35,378 --> 01:13:38,511
- ls everything arranged?
- Just as you ordered, Excellency.

637
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:41,930
You've broken the back of the rebellion
overnight. The King owes you much.

638
01:13:42,005 --> 01:13:45,967
He will pay it. l may even be able to collect
the full bounty on Captain Vallo...

639
01:13:46,039 --> 01:13:49,783
for he was killed by his own men
while trying to save El Libre.

640
01:13:53,754 --> 01:13:55,642
Don't be upset, my dear.

641
01:13:55,995 --> 01:13:59,542
You'll form new attachments here.
You're to marry the Governor.

642
01:13:59,612 --> 01:14:02,264
After l'm gone,
you'll rule through her, Governor.

643
01:14:02,333 --> 01:14:05,369
You'll order your people to till their fields
and fish their seas...

644
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:07,164
for the greater glory of the King.

645
01:14:07,232 --> 01:14:09,852
- l'd die first.
- No, you'll die last.

646
01:14:10,210 --> 01:14:13,080
First you'll watch your people go
one by one.

647
01:14:30,890 --> 01:14:32,680
Someday l'll kill you.

648
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:35,398
Officer!

649
01:14:41,392 --> 01:14:43,367
These methods will bring her round soon.

650
01:14:43,439 --> 01:14:46,091
l shouldn't like her to kill herself
before she marries.

651
01:14:46,161 --> 01:14:50,025
She's not the type. She'll marry you
and wait for a chance to poison you.

652
01:14:50,099 --> 01:14:53,418
lt doesn't sound like an ideal marriage.
Couldn't we dispense with that?

653
01:14:53,493 --> 01:14:55,697
Too much of it upsets my liver.

654
01:14:57,591 --> 01:15:01,269
lt's not your liver. lt's your heart.
lt's much too soft.

655
01:15:04,409 --> 01:15:06,745
Tonight the people bury El Libre.

656
01:15:07,003 --> 01:15:10,201
l want a proclamation posted
in the path of the funeral procession...

657
01:15:10,268 --> 01:15:12,724
announcing your marriage
to the daughter of El Libre.

658
01:15:12,797 --> 01:15:14,074
Excellency!

659
01:15:14,750 --> 01:15:18,298
People will be required to attend
and provide entertainment...

660
01:15:18,464 --> 01:15:20,155
to make it a day of rejoicing.

661
01:15:20,224 --> 01:15:22,429
We'll have them fill
the royal grain warehouse...

662
01:15:22,497 --> 01:15:24,735
with 10,000 sacks of grain as a present.

663
01:15:25,219 --> 01:15:26,943
You're learning fast.

664
01:15:27,042 --> 01:15:31,420
After the ceremony, l'll leave you
my troops and my blessings, and depart.

665
01:15:33,190 --> 01:15:37,502
Except for the late, lamented Vallo,
this has been a most boring assignment.

666
01:15:47,820 --> 01:15:51,335
On your way, pig! Amnesty
has been declared for all prisoners.

667
01:15:51,406 --> 01:15:54,822
Baron Gruda will give you a chance
to show allegiance at the wedding.

668
01:15:55,921 --> 01:15:57,066
Gruda.

669
01:15:58,706 --> 01:16:01,161
Gruda, someday l'll kill you.

670
01:16:02,131 --> 01:16:03,560
l'll kill you!

671
01:16:05,653 --> 01:16:09,070
- So it's a marriage now, is it?
- Consuelo will never do it.

672
01:16:09,142 --> 01:16:11,861
Look! 10,000 sacks of grain
for the Governor.

673
01:16:11,927 --> 01:16:13,137
Not mine!

674
01:16:13,528 --> 01:16:15,384
So we're to rejoice, are we?

675
01:16:28,766 --> 01:16:31,735
Baron Gruda has made
the defacing of public property...

676
01:16:31,808 --> 01:16:33,981
an offense punishable by death...

677
01:16:34,050 --> 01:16:36,768
both for the culprit and the accomplices.

678
01:16:37,091 --> 01:16:39,329
Sergeant, round up these people.

679
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:10,765
- What are you going to do about it?
- lt's no concern of mine.

680
01:17:18,965 --> 01:17:22,130
- What are you going to do about her?
- Get her out of it, somehow.

681
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:24,853
Alone, against 1,000 troops?

682
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:27,506
- There must be a way.
- There is.

683
01:17:27,577 --> 01:17:30,545
lt's a question of simple logic.
We need allies.

684
01:17:30,938 --> 01:17:33,459
These people need freedom.
Let's help them get it.

685
01:17:33,531 --> 01:17:35,954
The only freedom
l'm interested in is Consuelo's.

686
01:17:36,029 --> 01:17:39,096
She'll never consent to be free
until her people are free.

687
01:17:39,166 --> 01:17:40,476
lmpossible.

688
01:17:41,054 --> 01:17:43,608
They don't have a chance
against Gruda's crack troops.

689
01:17:43,679 --> 01:17:46,615
Science has learned
that nothing is impossible.

690
01:17:46,689 --> 01:17:50,432
Not long ago, l saw a ship
sailing through the skies of France...

691
01:17:50,498 --> 01:17:54,494
supported by a great bag filled with air
that was lighter than air.

692
01:17:55,108 --> 01:17:59,168
A friend of mine has invented a liquid
that can blast away mountains.

693
01:17:59,590 --> 01:18:03,651
l have completed plans for a boat
that can sail underneath the water.

694
01:18:04,296 --> 01:18:05,955
Who knows what we may accomplish...

695
01:18:06,025 --> 01:18:09,060
against the outdated Baron Gruda
and his outdated world?

696
01:18:09,131 --> 01:18:11,304
All we need is the help of these people...

697
01:18:11,404 --> 01:18:16,075
a little imagination, and deft fingers
with which to steal a few basic materials.

698
01:18:41,176 --> 01:18:42,868
The Baron thinks we're finished.

699
01:18:42,937 --> 01:18:45,394
We're going to let him go on thinking so.

700
01:18:45,467 --> 01:18:48,086
We'll fill the royal grain warehouse
as ordered.

701
01:18:48,156 --> 01:18:50,360
But with the seeds
of the Professor's genius.

702
01:18:50,428 --> 01:18:53,593
- l beg your pardon?
- The Baron has the most weapons.

703
01:18:53,662 --> 01:18:55,093
But we'll have the newest.

704
01:18:55,168 --> 01:18:58,235
An explosive that moves mountains.
A ship that flies through the air.

705
01:18:58,305 --> 01:19:01,951
A ship that flies through the air
by next Sunday? lmpossible.

706
01:19:02,467 --> 01:19:04,224
A great man once said to me:

707
01:19:04,324 --> 01:19:06,714
"Science has learned
that nothing is impossible."

708
01:19:09,959 --> 01:19:12,097
Gather round, lads and lasses.

709
01:19:12,550 --> 01:19:16,775
We'll show your fighters and workers
new ways to get rid of old enemies.

710
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:10,014
lt doesn't smell right.

711
01:20:11,552 --> 01:20:14,172
10,000 sacks of grain have been brought
into the warehouse.

712
01:20:14,242 --> 01:20:16,250
The tunnel to smuggle them out
is complete.

713
01:20:16,323 --> 01:20:19,554
The island is making headway
with the modern weapons to smuggle in...

714
01:20:19,620 --> 01:20:21,792
and still you stand and stir...

715
01:20:21,861 --> 01:20:23,749
that stew with no result.

716
01:20:23,813 --> 01:20:26,498
My friend sent me no formula to go on...

717
01:20:26,567 --> 01:20:30,016
simply the ingredients.
Principally nitrogen and glycerin.

718
01:20:30,088 --> 01:20:32,512
Anyway, l'm not really sure
l want to discover it.

719
01:20:32,586 --> 01:20:36,166
lf it can remove a mountain,
how do l know it won't remove an island?

720
01:20:36,236 --> 01:20:39,205
"ln science, one knows nothing
unless one experiments."

721
01:20:39,277 --> 01:20:41,384
l wish you'd stop quoting me.

722
01:20:48,049 --> 01:20:49,773
That's it.

723
01:20:57,333 --> 01:20:58,543
Soldiers!

724
01:21:01,622 --> 01:21:03,565
Don't fall down with that.

725
01:21:03,799 --> 01:21:05,622
Even if they shoot you.

726
01:21:34,566 --> 01:21:37,349
Be careful you don't over-inflate this
in the morning.

727
01:21:37,671 --> 01:21:40,061
We've cut the wall braces
to the breaking point.

728
01:21:40,137 --> 01:21:43,237
But we don't want them to collapse
before the signal.

729
01:21:43,306 --> 01:21:44,386
Remember...

730
01:21:44,458 --> 01:21:48,256
there'll be no signal given till Consuelo's
gotten safely away from Baron Gruda.

731
01:21:54,701 --> 01:21:55,880
Careful.

732
01:22:02,449 --> 01:22:04,173
The liquid explosive.

733
01:22:05,747 --> 01:22:09,295
- ls that all that's left?
- l've improved a bit on the formula.

734
01:22:09,365 --> 01:22:11,755
This is concentrated 1,000 times.

735
01:22:21,850 --> 01:22:23,028
Please.

736
01:23:01,900 --> 01:23:05,382
The royal grain warehouse is reported
full to capacity, Your Excellency.

737
01:23:05,454 --> 01:23:08,237
Amazing how you brought them
to their knees.

738
01:23:08,303 --> 01:23:12,461
Spare the rod and spoil the child.
Never forget that, my dear Governor.

739
01:23:13,104 --> 01:23:15,178
Let's get on with the wedding ceremony.

740
01:23:17,779 --> 01:23:22,287
First, a floral offering for the bride
from the unmarried girls of the island.

741
01:23:22,356 --> 01:23:24,779
A local custom for celebrating weddings.

742
01:23:24,854 --> 01:23:26,578
- Proceed.
- Music.

743
01:24:01,382 --> 01:24:03,619
Watch it. Your beard is showing.

744
01:24:04,232 --> 01:24:05,541
Here we go.

745
01:24:10,762 --> 01:24:13,317
These peasant shapes are not to my taste.

746
01:24:24,976 --> 01:24:26,286
Death to Gruda!

747
01:24:37,622 --> 01:24:38,899
Kill them!

748
01:25:08,611 --> 01:25:10,619
Port side battery. Fire!

749
01:25:18,888 --> 01:25:21,027
No, l mean left. Left!

750
01:25:21,096 --> 01:25:23,302
No. Right. No, left a bit.

751
01:25:24,747 --> 01:25:26,274
What's the matter with you?

752
01:25:26,347 --> 01:25:28,388
Don't you know where you're going?

753
01:25:52,919 --> 01:25:53,967
Fire!

754
01:26:04,475 --> 01:26:06,135
We're going after the girl.

755
01:26:35,338 --> 01:26:36,680
Let's strip for action.

756
01:26:44,430 --> 01:26:45,477
Halt!

757
01:26:48,367 --> 01:26:51,052
We'll cut her to pieces. Man your cannons.

758
01:26:52,432 --> 01:26:53,578
Come on, now.

759
01:27:01,557 --> 01:27:03,501
The high explosive. Quick.

760
01:27:39,493 --> 01:27:41,828
- Get underway!
- Aye, aye, sir.

761
01:27:44,199 --> 01:27:45,726
Man the capstan!

762
01:27:50,475 --> 01:27:51,904
Get her below.

763
01:27:53,517 --> 01:27:55,623
Don't waste time. Slit the cable!

764
01:28:00,015 --> 01:28:02,951
We've got to gain altitude.
Unload the ballast.

765
01:28:10,643 --> 01:28:12,400
Come on. Get rid of something.

766
01:28:22,936 --> 01:28:25,523
- What is it?
- lt is the wrath of heaven!

767
01:28:25,593 --> 01:28:27,449
lt has destroyed the fortress!

768
01:28:29,691 --> 01:28:32,278
Our ship and our lads.
We're heading straight for them.

769
01:28:33,629 --> 01:28:35,058
Make it close.

770
01:28:37,215 --> 01:28:38,622
But not too close.

771
01:28:38,688 --> 01:28:41,755
We'll need our ship and our lads
to catch Gruda.

772
01:28:47,075 --> 01:28:49,466
They're going to blow us up!
Jump for your lives!

773
01:29:22,195 --> 01:29:24,368
- lt's our own skipper!
- We knew you'd come.

774
01:29:24,436 --> 01:29:26,445
Get us off this ship.

775
01:29:26,518 --> 01:29:29,103
- Cut the rope down.
- Get us out of here!

776
01:29:45,086 --> 01:29:47,988
Pack out all canvas,
you fairy-tale sea snakes!

777
01:29:48,063 --> 01:29:49,372
Go get 'em!

778
01:29:54,498 --> 01:29:55,708
Move them!

779
01:29:55,938 --> 01:29:56,886
Move!

780
01:30:25,263 --> 01:30:28,231
l really think he plans to do battle with us.

781
01:30:30,929 --> 01:30:33,614
Captain Vallo's lost his head
as well as his heart.

782
01:30:47,705 --> 01:30:48,915
Haul that jib.

783
01:30:51,867 --> 01:30:53,689
Trim those top gallows.

784
01:30:54,459 --> 01:30:55,921
Two points starboard.

785
01:31:07,938 --> 01:31:09,947
Hold your fire for a broadside.

786
01:31:10,020 --> 01:31:12,060
Shall we fire?

787
01:31:12,132 --> 01:31:15,646
There'll be no firing with the girl
on the ship. We're going to board her.

788
01:31:24,457 --> 01:31:26,498
Below decks, the lot of you.

789
01:31:26,634 --> 01:31:28,063
On the double.

790
01:31:35,630 --> 01:31:37,321
Coming, Mr. Bellows?

791
01:31:39,151 --> 01:31:41,738
The fools are going
to trade broadsides with us.

792
01:31:48,788 --> 01:31:50,065
ln you go.

793
01:31:53,687 --> 01:31:56,405
With nobody at the wheel to steer,
we'll not get alongside.

794
01:31:56,472 --> 01:31:59,222
Too late to worry about it.
We'll have to take our chances.

795
01:31:59,288 --> 01:32:01,231
As ye wish. We'll go.

796
01:32:07,964 --> 01:32:09,754
My humble apologies.

797
01:32:09,822 --> 01:32:12,889
But if l can't live like a pirate,
l'll die like one.

798
01:32:12,958 --> 01:32:15,676
l'll stand by the wheel
and bring her alongside.

799
01:32:15,743 --> 01:32:18,111
Skipper! Do them the dirty!

800
01:33:06,997 --> 01:33:08,559
Stand by to fire!

801
01:33:18,299 --> 01:33:19,160
Fire!

802
01:37:02,397 --> 01:37:04,308
We're lost! Get the girl!

803
01:39:26,598 --> 01:39:28,155
Hold it, Professor! We've won!

804
01:39:28,606 --> 01:39:31,712
Get rid of that stuff.
