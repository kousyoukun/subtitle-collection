1
00:00:16,222 --> 00:00:18,808
{\fs14}升桅礼！快上所有横桁！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Man the yards! Quick on all canvas!{\r}

2
00:00:21,728 --> 00:00:23,938
{\fs14}集合，小伙子们，小娘儿们，集合{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Gather round, lads and lasses. Gather round.{\r}

3
00:00:24,105 --> 00:00:27,567
{\fs14}你们登上最后一次巡航的红海盗号...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}You've been shanghaied aboard for the last cruise of the Crimson Pirate...{\r}

4
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:30,361
{\fs14}是在很久很久以前，在遥远的加勒比海{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}a long, long time ago in the far, far Caribbean.{\r}

5
00:00:30,486 --> 00:00:34,240
{\fs14}记住，在海盗船上，在海盗水域，在海盗世界...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Remember, in a pirate ship, in pirate waters, in a pirate world...{\r}

6
00:00:34,741 --> 00:00:37,452
{\fs14}不要提问，只相信你看到的{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}ask no questions. Believe only what you see.{\r}

7
00:00:44,084 --> 00:00:46,878
{\fs14}不，即使看到，也要半信半疑{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}No. Believe half of what you see.{\r}

8
00:00:48,755 --> 00:00:51,383
{\fs14}操纵绞盘！起锚！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Man the capstan! Up anchor!{\r}

9
00:00:51,925 --> 00:00:53,802
{\fs14}快点动起来，你们这些笨蛋！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Move, you lubbers!{\r}

10
00:00:59,641 --> 00:01:05,017
红海盗
The Crimson Pirate

11
00:02:01,641 --> 00:02:13,017
18世纪末，一艘皇家海军的舰船，携带30门大炮在加勒比海执行任务

12
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,017
{\fs14}右舷！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Ship to starboard!{\r}

13
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:36,781
{\fs14}注意！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Attention!{\r}

14
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:51,755
{\fs14}一艘坏血病船，阁下{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}A scurvy ship, Your Excellency.{\r}

15
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:56,384
{\fs14}从他们的肢体判断，坏血病杀死了所有船员{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}You can tell by the position of the limbs. Scurvy's killed the whole crew.{\r}

16
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,975
{\fs14}小船很完整，罗德里格斯船长{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}A trim little ship, Captain Rodríguez.{\r}

17
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:07,395
{\fs14}我们把这艘船拖走，可以大赚一笔{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}We'll take her in tow. She'll bring a tidy sum.{\r}

18
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,733
{\fs14}派一名军官和两名士兵上船，天黑前把她拖过来{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Put an officer and two men aboard her, and have her in tow by nightfall.{\r}

19
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:13,068
{\fs14}是，是，先生{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Aye, aye, sir.{\r}

20
00:04:12,712 --> 00:04:15,923
{\fs14}- 死亡船上唯一有的是邪恶   - 是啊{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- Only evil can come from a death ship.
- Aye.{\r}

21
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:18,634
{\fs14}天哪，他们中有一个碰到我！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Sanctus, one of them touched me!{\r}

22
00:04:19,802 --> 00:04:21,804
{\fs14}横桁上面那两个呢？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}What happened to those two?{\r}

23
00:04:22,555 --> 00:04:23,806
{\fs14}跟我来{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Follow me.{\r}

24
00:04:59,634 --> 00:05:02,053
{\fs14}我谦卑地向你道歉{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}My humble apologies.{\r}

25
00:07:05,178 --> 00:07:06,137
{\fs14}无聊？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Bored?{\r}

26
00:07:06,179 --> 00:07:09,766
{\fs14}要是有什么东西能打发这次航行的单调乏味就好了{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}If only there was something to break the monotony of this voyage.{\r}

27
00:07:10,934 --> 00:07:12,727
{\fs14}请举起手来{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Hands aloft, please.{\r}

28
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,696
{\fs14}你们已经是瓦洛船长和他的坏血病船员的俘虏了{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}You're the prisoners of Captain Vallo and his scurvy crew.{\r}

29
00:07:40,255 --> 00:07:42,382
{\fs14}你可能过于自信了，瓦洛船长{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}You may be overconfident, Captain Vallo.{\r}

30
00:07:42,466 --> 00:07:45,094
{\fs14}这艘船上有两百名皇家海军陆战队士兵{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Two hundred of the King's marines are aboard this vessel.{\r}

31
00:07:45,177 --> 00:07:48,222
{\fs14}海盗只有二十个，但优势在我{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}And only 20 pirates. That puts the odds slightly in my favor.{\r}

32
00:07:48,305 --> 00:07:51,475
{\fs14}- 你最好放弃这艘船   - 我只是个乘客{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- Better surrender the ship.
- I am merely a passenger.{\r}

33
00:07:52,142 --> 00:07:54,019
{\fs14}- 他是谁？  - 格鲁达男爵{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- Who is he?
- Baron Gruda.{\r}

34
00:07:54,103 --> 00:07:56,313
{\fs14}国王陛下的特使{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Special envoy to His Majesty.{\r}

35
00:07:58,023 --> 00:08:00,818
{\fs14}哦，很高兴见到你{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Well, this is a pleasure.{\r}

36
00:08:01,235 --> 00:08:04,613
{\fs14}- 你绞死了我的很多朋友   - 他们谋杀了我很多人{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- You hanged most of my friends.
- For murdering most of mine.{\r}

37
00:08:08,784 --> 00:08:11,454
{\fs14}看来你现在只有199名海军陆战队士兵了，男爵{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Seems you have only 199 marines now, Baron.{\r}

38
00:08:13,122 --> 00:08:16,500
{\fs14}198，你最好说服船长投降{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}198. Better persuade the Captain to surrender.{\r}

39
00:08:16,626 --> 00:08:18,377
{\fs14}船长不是那种...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}The Captain is not the type to...{\r}

40
00:08:20,129 --> 00:08:21,672
{\fs14}197{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}197.{\r}

41
00:08:21,714 --> 00:08:24,842
{\fs14}不过，如果你允许我和他说话...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}However, if you'll permit me to speak to him...{\r}

42
00:08:28,471 --> 00:08:30,556
{\fs14}奥约，给船长传个话{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Ojo, pass the word for the Captain.{\r}

43
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:39,941
{\fs14}把船长打倒！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Bring down the Captain!{\r}

44
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:42,944
{\fs14}把船长送下去！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Send down the Captain!{\r}

45
00:08:43,486 --> 00:08:45,488
{\fs14}救救船长！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Save the Captain!{\r}

46
00:08:45,572 --> 00:08:47,574
{\fs14}把船长送下去！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Send down the Captain!{\r}

47
00:08:51,619 --> 00:08:53,872
{\fs14}先生，你要找船长吗？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Did you ask for the Captain, sir?{\r}

48
00:08:53,955 --> 00:08:56,875
{\fs14}是的，向他致意，带他进来{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Aye. Pay him my compliments and show him in.{\r}

49
00:09:26,571 --> 00:09:28,573
{\fs14}集合，小伙子们，集合{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Gather round, lads. Gather round.{\r}

50
00:09:33,203 --> 00:09:34,288
{\fs14}我们真走运{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}We're in luck.{\r}

51
00:09:34,371 --> 00:09:37,249
{\fs14}所有人都会有一笔丰厚的分红{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}All hands will soon be digging into a fat divvy.{\r}

52
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:41,879
{\fs14}我们正走向有史以来最大、最好的海盗时代{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}We're heading for the biggest and the best pirate days ever.{\r}

53
00:09:41,962 --> 00:09:44,840
{\fs14}这是一份大概的收获清单{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}And here's the rich tally in round numbers.{\r}

54
00:09:45,883 --> 00:09:47,551
{\fs14}“步枪：3000支{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}"Muskets: 3,000.{\r}

55
00:09:48,302 --> 00:09:50,304
{\fs14}“火药桶：1500个{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}"Powder kegs: 1,500.{\r}

56
00:09:50,971 --> 00:09:53,974
{\fs14}“步枪子弹：65000发{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}"Rounds of musket shot: 65,000.{\r}

57
00:09:54,725 --> 00:09:58,437
{\fs14}- “加农炮弹...”   - 请原谅我打断你...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- "Rounds of cannon shot... "
- Begging thy pardon for interrupting...{\r}

58
00:09:58,812 --> 00:10:01,023
{\fs14}你什么时候才能说到金子啊？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}but when will thee get into the gold?{\r}

59
00:10:04,527 --> 00:10:06,153
{\fs14}听着，伙计们，听着{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Listen, fellows, listen.{\r}

60
00:10:06,237 --> 00:10:09,949
{\fs14}在这个水域里有些岛屿正爆发反抗国王的浪潮...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}There are islands in these waters steaming with rebellion against the King...{\r}

61
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:13,077
{\fs14}但因为没有枪支弹药而遇到阻滞{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}and kept from boiling over only for lack of guns.{\r}

62
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,913
{\fs14}在那些岛屿，枪支比黄金还贵{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Islands where guns are worth more than gold.{\r}

63
00:10:15,996 --> 00:10:18,290
{\fs14}- 比钻石还贵   - 咱们卖军火？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- More than diamonds.
- Gunrunning?{\r}

64
00:10:18,332 --> 00:10:21,544
{\fs14}那不是海盗所为啊，船长，那是生意{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}But that's not piracy, Skipper. That's business.{\r}

65
00:10:21,627 --> 00:10:25,339
{\fs14}- 那意味着在岸上干活    - 我们在海上做得不够好{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- That means working ashore.
- We're doing poorly enough afloat.{\r}

66
00:10:25,882 --> 00:10:29,343
{\fs14}如果要尝试这种新把戏，我们就要让它成为一个好把戏{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}If we're going to try this new caper, let's make it a good one.{\r}

67
00:10:29,427 --> 00:10:34,348
{\fs14}这批货物可以从任何名副其实的叛军手中换来5万金弗罗林{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}This cargo will bring 50,000 gold florin from any rebels worth the name.{\r}

68
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:37,852
{\fs14}- 5万弗罗林？  - 这是个不错的选择{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- 50,000 florin?
- That's a pretty good take.{\r}

69
00:10:37,894 --> 00:10:40,229
{\fs14}让我们投票表决吧，所有赞成的人...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Let's put it to the vote. All those in favor...{\r}

70
00:10:40,313 --> 00:10:43,066
{\fs14}请原谅我插句嘴，船长...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}If you'll forgive my interrupting, Skipper...{\r}

71
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:45,735
{\fs14}我想在投票前考虑一下{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I'd like to think before I vote.{\r}

72
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:49,405
{\fs14}与此同时，我们照常做海盗勾当{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Meantime, we got regular pirate business to settle.{\r}

73
00:10:50,281 --> 00:10:53,243
{\fs14}我们有木板、罪犯和判决{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}We got the plank, the culprit, and the verdict.{\r}

74
00:10:53,326 --> 00:10:56,996
{\fs14}我们需要的是进行审判和执行判决{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}All we need's a trial and execution of a sentence.{\r}

75
00:10:57,038 --> 00:10:58,289
{\fs14}他有罪！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}He's guilty!{\r}

76
00:10:58,623 --> 00:11:01,459
{\fs14}审判到此为止，现在执行死刑{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}So much for the trial. Now for execution.{\r}

77
00:11:02,502 --> 00:11:04,462
{\fs14}来吧，杀了我，你们这些蠢货{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Come on. Kill me, you fools.{\r}

78
00:11:04,546 --> 00:11:08,967
{\fs14}皇家海军将扫荡七海，直到干净彻底地把你们每个人都吊死{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}The King's Navy will scour the Seven Seas till every one of you is hung high and dry.{\r}

79
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:11,928
{\fs14}- 把他带上木板！  - 打住！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- To the plank with him!
- Avast!{\r}

80
00:11:20,103 --> 00:11:22,063
{\fs14}对他来说，不会有走木板{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}There'll be no plank-walking for him.{\r}

81
00:11:22,147 --> 00:11:24,566
{\fs14}请原谅我的迟钝，船长...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Forgive my slow-wittedness, Skipper...{\r}

82
00:11:24,608 --> 00:11:28,570
{\fs14}你是在请求我们放过这只香喷喷的癞蛤蟆吗？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}but are thee asking us to spare this sweet-smelling toad?{\r}

83
00:11:29,196 --> 00:11:31,531
{\fs14}恳请阁下原谅{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Begging Thy Excellency's pardon.{\r}

84
00:11:31,615 --> 00:11:34,785
{\fs14}你们的船长比你们所有人加起来都聪明{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Your captain's got more brains than all of you put together.{\r}

85
00:11:34,868 --> 00:11:37,037
{\fs14}毫无疑问，你打算拿我换赎金{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}No doubt you intend to hold me for ransom.{\r}

86
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,624
{\fs14}不，我的好朋友，我让你自由{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}No, my fine-feathered friend. I'm setting you free.{\r}

87
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:45,295
{\fs14}我说，这只让我们取乐的猴子并不能给我们带来好处{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I say, if there's no profit in the monkey we'll have our pleasure.{\r}

88
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:47,464
{\fs14}我说，他活着对我们有利{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I say there is profit in him. Alive.{\r}

89
00:11:47,548 --> 00:11:49,883
{\fs14}- 有多少利润？  - 现在听我说完{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- How much profit?
- Now hear me out.{\r}

90
00:11:52,261 --> 00:11:55,514
{\fs14}我说过，可以从与叛军的军火交易中获得5万金弗罗林...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I said 50,000 gold florin from the rebels for the guns...{\r}

91
00:11:55,597 --> 00:11:59,727
{\fs14}而这位是由国王特别委任的镇压叛军的头领{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}and here, by special commission, is the King's chief rebel-catcher.{\r}

92
00:12:00,311 --> 00:12:03,105
{\fs14}那么，为什么不通过告诉他和他的国王...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}So why not another 50,000 from him and his king...{\r}

93
00:12:03,188 --> 00:12:05,941
{\fs14}我们把枪卖给了哪支叛军而再得5万呢{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}for telling them which rebels we sell all the guns to.{\r}

94
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:07,151
{\fs14}嗯，男爵？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Eh, Baron?{\r}

95
00:12:07,234 --> 00:12:09,987
{\fs14}一个绝妙的计划，船长，祝贺你{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}A brilliant scheme, Captain. My congratulations.{\r}

96
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,822
{\fs14}你的祝贺{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Thy congratulations.{\r}

97
00:12:12,615 --> 00:12:16,077
{\fs14}如果得到这家伙的祝贺，那就不符合海盗的利益{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}If thou art for it, it is not for the good of pirates.{\r}

98
00:12:16,118 --> 00:12:18,120
{\fs14}很好？先生们，太棒了{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Good? Gentlemen, it's magnificent.{\r}

99
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:22,917
{\fs14}我要到眼镜蛇岛去抓一个人，埃尔·利布勒，粉碎他的叛乱{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I'm bound for the Island of Cobra to catch a man, El Libre, and smash his rebellion.{\r}

100
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:27,255
{\fs14}如果你用这些军火，把他从洞里引到我手里...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}If you'll take the guns there, lure him out of his hole and into my hands...{\r}

101
00:12:27,338 --> 00:12:29,882
{\fs14}我可以给你们再加5万{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I'll raise the purse another 50,000.{\r}

102
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,887
{\fs14}伙计们，这样就是：15万弗洛林{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}There it is, lads, in round figures: 150,000 florin.{\r}

103
00:12:38,141 --> 00:12:40,893
{\fs14}你现在还有什么要说，谦卑的贝罗斯先生？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}What do you say now, Mr. Humble Bellows?{\r}

104
00:12:41,477 --> 00:12:44,272
{\fs14}你谦卑的仆人会相信的...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Thy humble servant will believe it...{\r}

105
00:12:44,355 --> 00:12:46,649
{\fs14}当你谦卑的仆人看得到时{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}when thy humble servant sees it.{\r}

106
00:12:47,483 --> 00:12:49,861
{\fs14}我想我们成交了，船长{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I take it we have a deal, Captain.{\r}

107
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:24,729
{\fs14}这次换船，船长，让人很不愉快{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}This change of ship, Captain, most uncomfortable.{\r}

108
00:13:24,855 --> 00:13:28,108
{\fs14}我的人不会转移货物，这种活太实在了{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}My men won't transfer cargo. Too much like honest work.{\r}

109
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:31,653
{\fs14}瓦洛船长，你的人只给我留了艏斜帆和上桅帆{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Captain Vallo, your men have only left me headsail and topsail.{\r}

110
00:13:31,737 --> 00:13:34,406
{\fs14}它们早晚会把你送到眼镜蛇岛的{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}They're enough to get you to Cobra sooner or later.{\r}

111
00:13:34,489 --> 00:13:36,658
{\fs14}我的船比这艘驳船快{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}My ship is faster than this barge.{\r}

112
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:40,370
{\fs14}我不能让你在我完成与埃尔·利布勒的交易之前到港{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I don't want you making port before I've got El Libre ready for delivery...{\r}

113
00:13:40,454 --> 00:13:42,497
{\fs14}或者在我背后开枪{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}or putting a shot in my backside.{\r}

114
00:13:42,581 --> 00:13:46,043
{\fs14}希望埃尔·利布勒不像你这么小心，船长{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I hope El Libre is not as careful as you are, Captain.{\r}

115
00:13:57,763 --> 00:13:59,765
{\fs14}放开舵！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Cast off helm!{\r}

116
00:14:01,684 --> 00:14:03,852
{\fs14}放开船尾！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Cast off stern!{\r}

117
00:14:05,896 --> 00:14:10,025
{\fs14}- 贝洛斯先生，起航！  - 是，是的，先生！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- Mr. Bellows, make sail!
- Aye, aye, sir!{\r}

118
00:14:35,259 --> 00:14:37,053
{\fs14}拉起来，满帆{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Haul up, full and by.{\r}

119
00:14:37,512 --> 00:14:41,057
{\fs14}北北东，我们要去眼镜蛇岛{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Nor' nor' east. We're heading for the Isle of Cobra.{\r}

120
00:14:41,641 --> 00:14:43,726
{\fs14}快点，你们这些笨蛋，动起来！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Come on, you lubbers, move!{\r}

121
00:15:20,055 --> 00:15:22,933
{\fs14}听，听！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Hear ye, hear ye!{\r}

122
00:15:23,183 --> 00:15:26,353
{\fs14}国王的船现在抛锚了...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}The King's vessel is now at anchor...{\r}

123
00:15:26,436 --> 00:15:29,898
{\fs14}在眼镜蛇港，格鲁达男爵乘坐此船{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}in the port of Cobra with Baron Gruda aboard.{\r}

124
00:15:29,981 --> 00:15:34,778
{\fs14}任何示威都将被视为叛国罪{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Any demonstration will be regarded as high treason.{\r}

125
00:15:36,655 --> 00:15:38,782
{\fs14}人们看起来很安静，不是吗？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}The people seem very quiet, don't they?{\r}

126
00:15:38,865 --> 00:15:42,411
{\fs14}我认为他们根本没打算向格鲁达男爵示威抗议{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I don't think they intend to demonstrate against Baron Gruda after all.{\r}

127
00:15:42,494 --> 00:15:45,163
{\fs14}- 显然没有，总督   - 真遗憾{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- Apparently not, Governor.
- What a pity.{\r}

128
00:15:45,247 --> 00:15:47,833
{\fs14}我们的军队本可以像割小麦一样把他们砍倒{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Our troops could've cut them down like wheat.{\r}

129
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,669
{\fs14}我们不能按照一般原则杀一些吗？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Couldn't we shoot a few on general principles?{\r}

130
00:15:50,711 --> 00:15:52,129
{\fs14}这样也许能给男爵留下好印象{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Might impress the Baron.{\r}

131
00:15:52,171 --> 00:15:54,548
{\fs14}也有可能他会觉得你只是在惹麻烦{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}He might feel you are merely provoking trouble.{\r}

132
00:15:54,631 --> 00:15:57,885
{\fs14}真令人恼火，向格鲁达男爵敬礼{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Most exasperating. Fire the salute to Baron Gruda.{\r}

133
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:02,014
{\fs14}注意！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Attention!{\r}

134
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:18,823
{\fs14}给句话，我去给那些背刺者猛烈一击{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Give the word and I'll dose those backstabbers with a broadside.{\r}

135
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:21,492
{\fs14}他们不是在向我们开火，你这个白痴{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}They're not firing at us, you powder-brained ape.{\r}

136
00:16:21,575 --> 00:16:25,788
{\fs14}他们对我们放礼炮15响，因为我们悬挂的是格鲁达的旗帜{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}They're giving us a 15-gun salute. We're flying the flag of Gruda.{\r}

137
00:16:25,871 --> 00:16:29,041
{\fs14}斯莱米，把旗子拿出来，把我给你的那封信拿出来{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Slimey, bring out the flags and run up that message I gave you.{\r}

138
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:32,503
{\fs14}还有，斯莱米，代我向总督致意{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}And, Slimey, give the Governor my compliments.{\r}

139
00:16:32,586 --> 00:16:34,130
{\fs14}红海盗的致意？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}The Crimson Pirate's?{\r}

140
00:16:34,213 --> 00:16:36,674
{\fs14}不，你这个牡蛎头，是格鲁达男爵的致意{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}No, you oyster-head, Baron Gruda's.{\r}

141
00:16:37,425 --> 00:16:41,053
{\fs14}贝洛斯先生，让剩下的喽啰留在甲板下面{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Mr. Bellows, keep the rest of these half-masted monkeys below deck.{\r}

142
00:16:41,137 --> 00:16:42,430
{\fs14}是，是的，船长{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Aye, aye, Skipper.{\r}

143
00:16:42,513 --> 00:16:45,558
{\fs14}小心点，伙计们，我今晚会和埃尔·利布勒一起回来{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Keep a sharp lookout, lads. I'll be back with El Libre tonight.{\r}

144
00:16:45,641 --> 00:16:47,143
{\fs14}我们走，奥约{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Let's go, Ojo.{\r}

145
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,696
{\fs14}那里有一个好海盗，像卖鱼小贩一样贩卖他的货{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}There goes a good pirate, to sell his wares like a fish peddler.{\r}

146
00:16:59,238 --> 00:17:01,699
{\fs14}当然，这并不意味着对船长的不尊重{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Meaning no disrespect to the Skipper, of course.{\r}

147
00:17:01,783 --> 00:17:03,576
{\fs14}我们的脑袋都有悬赏...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Us with a price on our heads...{\r}

148
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:07,872
{\fs14}像鸭子一样藏在国王陛下的某个港口{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}holed, too, in one of His Majesty's ports like sitting ducks.{\r}

149
00:17:08,623 --> 00:17:13,044
{\fs14}但如果船长再拉我们一把，我们就会成有金蛋的鸭子{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}But if the Skipper pulls us through again, we'd be the ducks with the golden eggs.{\r}

150
00:17:13,086 --> 00:17:16,589
{\fs14}你想的是母鹅，原谅我的纠正，毒保罗{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}You're thinking of geese, if you'll pardon the correction, Poison Paul.{\r}

151
00:17:17,048 --> 00:17:19,926
{\fs14}雁行之鹅{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Geese on a wild-goose chase.{\r}

152
00:17:31,271 --> 00:17:32,772
{\fs14}他们的旗语怎么说，约瑟夫？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}What do they say, Joseph?{\r}

153
00:17:32,814 --> 00:17:36,151
{\fs14}他们在船上发现了瘟疫，他们正在隔离自己...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}They've got the plague onboard, and they're quarantining themselves...{\r}

154
00:17:36,234 --> 00:17:38,278
{\fs14}直到染病者被杀死或治愈{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}until the victims are killed or cured.{\r}

155
00:17:39,696 --> 00:17:42,491
{\fs14}我们必须向格鲁达男爵表示深切哀悼{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}We must signal my profound condolences to Baron Gruda.{\r}

156
00:17:42,574 --> 00:17:45,452
{\fs14}- 很好，总督   - 也许这是最好的，约瑟夫{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- Very well, Governor.
- Maybe it's all for the best, Joseph.{\r}

157
00:17:45,494 --> 00:17:47,871
{\fs14}埃尔·利布勒的追随者可能会举起他们的手...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}El Libre's followers may yet show their hands...{\r}

158
00:17:47,955 --> 00:17:50,749
{\fs14}给我一个让男爵印象深刻的机会，叫我的马车{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}and give me a chance to impress the Baron. Order my carriage.{\r}

159
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:55,170
{\fs14}驱散人群，更换警卫，在街上加倍巡逻{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Disperse the crowd. Change the guard, and double your patrols in the street.{\r}

160
00:17:56,463 --> 00:17:58,382
{\fs14}来吧，我的美人们{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Come on, my popsy-wopsy-wopsies.{\r}

161
00:18:09,309 --> 00:18:13,355
{\fs14}瘟疫是吗？希望他们都能接受，格鲁达男爵先来{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Plague, is it? May it take all of them. Baron Gruda first.{\r}

162
00:18:13,814 --> 00:18:16,442
{\fs14}是的，如果瘟疫没弄死他们，我们也会弄死他们{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Aye, and if the plague don't, we will.{\r}

163
00:18:19,069 --> 00:18:21,614
{\fs14}- 你是谁？  - 跟你们一样的普通渔民{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- Who are you?
- Simple fisher folk like yourselves.{\r}

164
00:18:21,697 --> 00:18:25,701
{\fs14}给我们一大罐啤酒，一句友好的话，以及一个与国王战斗的机会{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Put in for a tankard of ale, a friendly word, and a chance to fight the King.{\r}

165
00:18:28,621 --> 00:18:30,081
{\fs14}为什么选择我们？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Why choose us?{\r}

166
00:18:34,877 --> 00:18:36,671
{\fs14}你的言行举止像个战士{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}You look and talk like a fighter.{\r}

167
00:18:37,171 --> 00:18:38,589
{\fs14}惺惺相惜吧{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}It takes one to know one.{\r}

168
00:18:38,673 --> 00:18:41,384
{\fs14}你也许认为我们是同类，好吧，也许不是{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}You may have us marked, all right. Maybe not.{\r}

169
00:18:41,467 --> 00:18:43,427
{\fs14}但我们并没有认同你{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}But we haven't marked you yet.{\r}

170
00:18:43,511 --> 00:18:45,972
{\fs14}- 我们不会问任何问题   - 我们也不会{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- We're asking no questions.
- We are.{\r}

171
00:18:46,889 --> 00:18:49,475
{\fs14}我听到的关于埃尔·利布勒的消息，对我来说已经足够了{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}What I've heard about El Libre is good enough for me.{\r}

172
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:51,102
{\fs14}告诉我们怎么联系他{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Tell us how to contact him.{\r}

173
00:18:51,185 --> 00:18:54,731
{\fs14}像他那样的汉子肯定很乐意船上多两个全副武装的小伙子{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}A man like him would be pleased to have two more strong-armed lads aboard.{\r}

174
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,032
{\fs14}他们不轻易相信人，对吗？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Not very trusting souls, are they?{\r}

175
00:19:15,752 --> 00:19:19,005
{\fs14}我想我们必须证明我们对埃尔·利布勒的高度敬仰{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I guess we'll have to prove our high regard for El Libre.{\r}

176
00:19:31,893 --> 00:19:34,521
{\fs14}奥约，你说出了我想说的{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Ojo, you took the words right out of my mouth.{\r}

177
00:19:34,604 --> 00:19:36,898
{\fs14}跟国王的手下打一架，走{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}A brawl with the King's men. Let's go.{\r}

178
00:19:42,404 --> 00:19:46,324
{\fs14}左，右，左，原地踏步！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Left, right. Left. Mark time!{\r}

179
00:19:49,244 --> 00:19:50,620
{\fs14}向右转{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Right turn.{\r}

180
00:19:52,581 --> 00:19:53,665
{\fs14}立定！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Halt!{\r}

181
00:19:56,043 --> 00:19:59,922
{\fs14}快步走！向前！立定！向左转！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Quick march! Forward! Halt! Turn!{\r}

182
00:20:09,056 --> 00:20:11,141
{\fs14}向右转！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Right wheel!{\r}

183
00:20:16,271 --> 00:20:18,399
{\fs14}齐步走！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}March!{\r}

184
00:20:20,693 --> 00:20:21,819
{\fs14}立定！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Halt!{\r}

185
00:20:23,779 --> 00:20:25,573
{\fs14}持刀敬礼！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Present arms!{\r}

186
00:20:56,145 --> 00:20:57,647
{\fs14}共和国万岁！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Long live the republic!{\r}

187
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:59,607
{\fs14}叛军！抓住他们！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Rebels! Get them!{\r}

188
00:21:14,998 --> 00:21:16,457
{\fs14}埃尔·利布勒万岁！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Long live El Libre!{\r}

189
00:21:16,499 --> 00:21:17,917
{\fs14}追他们！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}After them!{\r}

190
00:22:00,502 --> 00:22:01,753
{\fs14}他们来了！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}There they are!{\r}

191
00:22:03,297 --> 00:22:04,756
{\fs14}别让他们跑了！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Don't let them get away!{\r}

192
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,620
{\fs14}伙计们！快来！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Men! Come on!{\r}

193
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,275
{\fs14}快点！快，到那个角落{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Come on! Quick, in that corner.{\r}

194
00:23:46,485 --> 00:23:47,986
{\fs14}他们来了！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}There they go!{\r}

195
00:23:59,915 --> 00:24:01,625
{\fs14}快点，到后面{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Hurry up. In back.{\r}

196
00:24:04,336 --> 00:24:05,629
{\fs14}这边走！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}This way!{\r}

197
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,260
{\fs14}往前跑{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Go ahead.{\r}

198
00:24:19,727 --> 00:24:20,894
{\fs14}刺穿帆布{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Pierce the canvas.{\r}

199
00:24:34,742 --> 00:24:35,826
{\fs14}开火！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Fire!{\r}

200
00:24:43,376 --> 00:24:44,502
{\fs14}准备，开火！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Ready? Fire!{\r}

201
00:24:55,346 --> 00:24:58,307
{\fs14}抬起来！举起来！快点，举起来！开火！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Pick it up! Lift it up! Come on. Lift it up! Fire!{\r}

202
00:25:02,645 --> 00:25:03,855
{\fs14}带我们走{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Take us away.{\r}

203
00:25:06,232 --> 00:25:08,025
{\fs14}他们逃走了！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}They're getting away!{\r}

204
00:25:26,294 --> 00:25:28,838
{\fs14}锁上地窖！堵住小巷！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Latch the cellars! Block the alley!{\r}

205
00:25:44,646 --> 00:25:45,814
{\fs14}留神，士兵{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Look out. Soldiers.{\r}

206
00:25:51,987 --> 00:25:53,196
{\fs14}等一下{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Just a minute.{\r}

207
00:26:03,457 --> 00:26:04,791
{\fs14}搜查这里{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Search the place.{\r}

208
00:27:04,227 --> 00:27:07,188
{\fs14}- 臭味能把猪熏跑   - 已经熏跑了{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- The stink would drive away a pig.
- Which it did.{\r}

209
00:27:08,731 --> 00:27:10,441
{\fs14}看好门{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Watch that door.{\r}

210
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:18,992
{\fs14}你们救了我们，小伙子，你们救了我们{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}You've saved us, lad, you've saved us.{\r}

211
00:27:19,075 --> 00:27:20,910
{\fs14}我们是自己人{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}We're among our own kind.{\r}

212
00:27:22,245 --> 00:27:23,496
{\fs14}叛军{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Rebels.{\r}

213
00:27:23,788 --> 00:27:26,249
{\fs14}如果你是埃尔·利布勒本人，我也不会感到惊讶{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Wouldn't surprise me if you were El Libre himself.{\r}

214
00:27:26,499 --> 00:27:29,961
{\fs14}- 你看起来像天生的领袖   - 我叫帕布罗·墨菲{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- You look like a born leader of men.
- The name's Pablo Murphy.{\r}

215
00:27:30,044 --> 00:27:33,840
{\fs14}我父亲教给我足够多的爱尔兰语，我一听就知道你在花言巧语{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}And I got enough Irish from me father to know blarney when I hear it.{\r}

216
00:27:33,965 --> 00:27:36,760
{\fs14}要不是看在你们对付那些士兵的份上，我们早就将你们割喉了...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}We'd have slit your throats for snooping spies by now...{\r}

217
00:27:36,843 --> 00:27:38,678
{\fs14}因为你们像奸细一样窥探打听{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}only for what you did to them soldiers.{\r}

218
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,847
{\fs14}- 他们是谁？  - 谁知道呢？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- Who are they?
- Who knows?{\r}

219
00:27:40,889 --> 00:27:43,391
{\fs14}这个是哑巴，而这个是话痨{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}This one can't talk and this one can't keep quiet.{\r}

220
00:27:43,475 --> 00:27:46,895
{\fs14}好吧，让我们开门见山，我是乐意为你效劳的瓦洛船长{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}All right, let's get to the point. I'm Captain Vallo at your service.{\r}

221
00:27:46,978 --> 00:27:48,688
{\fs14}这是奥约副官{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}And this is Lieutenant Ojo.{\r}

222
00:27:51,942 --> 00:27:54,194
{\fs14}瓦洛？海盗？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Vallo? The pirate?{\r}

223
00:27:54,277 --> 00:27:55,862
{\fs14}红海盗？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}The Crimson Pirate?{\r}

224
00:27:55,904 --> 00:27:59,032
{\fs14}是的，甜妈，我要跟埃尔·利布勒做笔交易...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}That's right, sweet mother, with a bargain for El Libre...{\r}

225
00:27:59,074 --> 00:28:01,243
{\fs14}整整一船枪支弹药{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}a shipload of powder shot and musketry.{\r}

226
00:28:01,326 --> 00:28:03,704
{\fs14}- 格鲁达男爵的船   - 格鲁达男爵的船？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- Baron Gruda's ship.
- Baron Gruda's ship?{\r}

227
00:28:03,787 --> 00:28:06,206
{\fs14}是的，格鲁达男爵拥有30门大炮{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Aye. Baron Gruda's own 30-gunner.{\r}

228
00:28:06,748 --> 00:28:09,710
{\fs14}我们对付她轻而易举，就像你对付鲭鱼一样，好渔夫{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}We took her as easy as you'd take a mackerel, fine fishermen.{\r}

229
00:28:09,793 --> 00:28:12,045
{\fs14}再容易不过了，因为我们用了死饵{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Easier. For we used dead bait.{\r}

230
00:28:12,588 --> 00:28:14,590
{\fs14}你们杀了格鲁达男爵？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}You killed Baron Gruda?{\r}

231
00:28:15,841 --> 00:28:18,844
{\fs14}如果我那样做了，你就不会想买我的枪了{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}If I did that you wouldn't need the guns I want to sell you.{\r}

232
00:28:18,927 --> 00:28:21,263
{\fs14}我是个海盗，不是杀狗的{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I'm a pirate, not a dog killer.{\r}

233
00:28:21,346 --> 00:28:23,849
{\fs14}但我喜欢你们，喜欢你们的风格{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}But I like you lads. I like your style.{\r}

234
00:28:23,932 --> 00:28:25,851
{\fs14}所以大家注意听了：{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}So gather round and get this:{\r}

235
00:28:25,934 --> 00:28:29,855
{\fs14}男爵将在几天后乘我自己的船抵达港口{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}The Baron will arrive in port aboard my own ship in a matter of days.{\r}

236
00:28:29,938 --> 00:28:33,859
{\fs14}带我去见埃尔·利布勒怎么样？这样我们就可以完成军火交易了{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}So how about taking me to El Libre so we can close the deal for the guns?{\r}

237
00:28:33,943 --> 00:28:35,819
{\fs14}机不可失，你们懂的{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Time and tide, you know.{\r}

238
00:28:56,632 --> 00:28:58,718
{\fs14}把他们的臭味冲刷掉，带到下面{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Wash the stink off them and take them below.{\r}

239
00:28:58,801 --> 00:29:00,177
{\fs14}传话下去{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Pass the word along.{\r}

240
00:29:21,574 --> 00:29:24,577
{\fs14}等天黑，我们把他们带到小船上...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}When it's dark, we'll take them to the small boat...{\r}

241
00:29:24,661 --> 00:29:26,871
{\fs14}把他们送回他们的船    - 跟我来{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}and row them out to their ship.   - Come with me.{\r}

242
00:29:39,843 --> 00:29:41,553
{\fs14}现在，你们知道计划是什么了{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Now, you know what the plan is.{\r}

243
00:29:41,636 --> 00:29:43,972
{\fs14}剩下的人将跟我的小伙子们上渔船...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}The rest will join my lads at the fishing boats...{\r}

244
00:29:44,055 --> 00:29:46,641
{\fs14}停在海盗船旁接收军火{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}and stand by the pirate vessel to receive the guns.{\r}

245
00:29:46,725 --> 00:29:48,893
{\fs14}如果海盗们拒绝赎回他们呢？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Suppose the pirates refuse to give them up?{\r}

246
00:29:48,977 --> 00:29:51,771
{\fs14}我会把刀子插在瓦洛船长的喉咙里{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I'll keep my knife at Captain Vallo's throat.{\r}

247
00:29:51,855 --> 00:29:54,608
{\fs14}要么他下令交出军火...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Either he'll give the order to hand over the guns...{\r}

248
00:29:54,691 --> 00:29:56,818
{\fs14}要么他永远下不了命令{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}or he'll never give another order.{\r}

249
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:00,071
{\fs14}帕布罗·墨菲，你是在割我们的喉，而不是他的{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}You're cutting our throats, Pablo Murphy, not his.{\r}

250
00:30:03,658 --> 00:30:06,244
{\fs14}我喜欢你的勇气，帕布罗，但不喜欢你的计划{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I like your nerve, Pablo, but not your plan.{\r}

251
00:30:06,328 --> 00:30:10,457
{\fs14}我说我们必须在格鲁达男爵到来之前拿到军火并夺取宫殿{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I say we've got to get the guns and take the palace before Baron Gruda gets here.{\r}

252
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:14,169
{\fs14}我还说我们需要的不仅仅是枪，我们需要埃尔·利布勒来领导我们{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}And I say we need more than guns. We need El Libre to lead us.{\r}

253
00:30:14,253 --> 00:30:17,047
{\fs14}你们这些女人总是不愿面对事实，埃尔·利布勒被抓了{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}You women won't face facts. El Libre's been captured.{\r}

254
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:19,049
{\fs14}面对事实的方法就是去救他{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}The way to face facts is to rescue him.{\r}

255
00:30:19,091 --> 00:30:21,677
{\fs14}救他？从国王的监狱？不可能{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Rescue him? From the King's prison? Impossible.{\r}

256
00:30:23,387 --> 00:30:27,516
{\fs14}这个疯子有30门大炮和一船海盗{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Not for a desperate man with a 30-gunner and a fighting crew.{\r}

257
00:30:28,058 --> 00:30:30,269
{\fs14}让海盗去救埃尔·利布勒？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}A pirate rescue for El Libre?{\r}

258
00:30:30,561 --> 00:30:33,939
{\fs14}那就是把他从煎锅里拿出来又扔进火里{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}That'd be taking him from the frying pan and throwing him into the fire.{\r}

259
00:30:34,023 --> 00:30:36,483
{\fs14}- 我们要按自己的方式处理    - 隐蔽！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- We'll handle this our own way.
- About face!{\r}

260
00:30:36,567 --> 00:30:37,693
{\fs14}过来{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Get over here.{\r}

261
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:22,238
{\fs14}这里有人聚会！打开门，快！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}There's a meeting! The door, quick!{\r}

262
00:31:38,838 --> 00:31:40,298
{\fs14}出去！另一个门！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Out! The other door!{\r}

263
00:32:01,528 --> 00:32:04,114
{\fs14}如果我放了你，我能指望你们的帮助吗？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}If I release you, can I count on your help?{\r}

264
00:32:05,824 --> 00:32:07,451
{\fs14}你们会得到满意的报酬{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}You'll be well paid.{\r}

265
00:32:25,719 --> 00:32:27,596
{\fs14}你错看了我们的男人{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}You misjudged our men.{\r}

266
00:32:28,055 --> 00:32:29,890
{\fs14}不会错看我们的女人{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Don't misjudge our women.{\r}

267
00:32:31,391 --> 00:32:33,018
{\fs14}- 这里有一个门   - 哪里？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- Another door here.
- Where?{\r}

268
00:32:33,102 --> 00:32:34,478
{\fs14}跟我来{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Follow me.{\r}

269
00:33:18,898 --> 00:33:22,443
{\fs14}- 那里打枪是怎么回事？  - 船长从市场回来了{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- What's all the shooting?
- The Skipper coming back from market.{\r}

270
00:33:22,527 --> 00:33:25,279
{\fs14}我有一种感觉，我们要出海了{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I have a feeling we'll be putting out to sea.{\r}

271
00:33:25,363 --> 00:33:29,200
{\fs14}起锚，满帆，看起来还活着！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Hoist anchor. Man all canvas. Look lively!{\r}

272
00:33:29,367 --> 00:33:31,327
{\fs14}升桅礼！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Man the yards!{\r}

273
00:33:35,915 --> 00:33:37,208
{\fs14}准备开火！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Prepare to fire!{\r}

274
00:33:42,422 --> 00:33:43,715
{\fs14}一号开火！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Fire one!{\r}

275
00:33:52,807 --> 00:33:54,100
{\fs14}二号开火！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Fire two!{\r}

276
00:34:09,324 --> 00:34:13,954
{\fs14}给格鲁达男爵的船打信号，叫她靠边行驶，我们的炮可能会打到她{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Signal Baron Gruda's ship for a broadside. One of us can knock her out of the water.{\r}

277
00:34:35,225 --> 00:34:38,771
{\fs14}海岸炮台要求对他们进行侧击，贝洛斯先生{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Shore battery's asking for a broadside against them, Mr. Bellows.{\r}

278
00:34:38,854 --> 00:34:41,357
{\fs14}那你还等什么，流口水的白痴？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}What are you waiting for, drooling idiot?{\r}

279
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,902
{\fs14}- 给他们一个侧击！  - 是，是的，先生！侧击！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- Give 'em a broadside!
- Aye, aye, sir! One broadside coming up!{\r}

280
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:05,840
{\fs14}瞄得很准，小伙子们，目标明确{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Good shooting, lads. Well aimed.{\r}

281
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,884
{\fs14}船长，这是你在市场上买的吗？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Skipper, be that what thou bought at market?{\r}

282
00:35:10,678 --> 00:35:12,972
{\fs14}把这位女士带到下面，让她舒服些{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Take the lady below and make her comfortable.{\r}

283
00:35:16,726 --> 00:35:18,477
{\fs14}谢谢，船长{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Thank you, Captain.{\r}

284
00:35:21,314 --> 00:35:23,399
{\fs14}英勇的瓦洛船长回来了，嗯，小伙子们？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}The gallant Captain Vallo, eh, lads?{\r}

285
00:35:29,113 --> 00:35:31,324
{\fs14}那是埃尔·利布勒小妞吗？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Be that bit of fluff El Libre?{\r}

286
00:35:31,407 --> 00:35:33,618
{\fs14}那是带我们去见埃尔·利布勒的小妞{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}That's the bit of fluff that's taking us to him.{\r}

287
00:35:33,701 --> 00:35:37,830
{\fs14}埃尔·利布勒被关押在圣佩罗岛，离这里只有一天的航程{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}He's being held on the Island of San Perot, only a day's sailing from here.{\r}

288
00:35:39,207 --> 00:35:41,334
{\fs14}谁在替我们抱着他，船长？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Who's holding him for us, Skipper?{\r}

289
00:35:41,417 --> 00:35:46,005
{\fs14}国王的军队，在军事监狱里，伙计们，还有什么比这更甜蜜的呢？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}The King's troop. In the military prison. Now, what could be sweeter, lads?{\r}

290
00:35:46,047 --> 00:35:49,884
{\fs14}我们要从国王的手下把他偷走，再卖给国王的手下{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}We'll steal him from the King's men, and sell him back to a king's man.{\r}

291
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:54,848
{\fs14}- 但你真的打算...    - 带我们进国王的监狱？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- But be thou seriously planning to...
- Walk us into a king's prison?{\r}

292
00:35:54,889 --> 00:35:57,851
{\fs14}怕什么，没什么的，谦卑的贝洛斯，没啥大不了的{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Why, not at all, Humble Bellows, not at all.{\r}

293
00:35:58,226 --> 00:36:00,437
{\fs14}集合，小伙子们，集合{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Gather round, lads, gather round!{\r}

294
00:36:47,318 --> 00:36:51,905
{\fs14}- 心肝儿 ，心肝儿 ，多么漂亮的小刀啊   - 你想仔细看看吗？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- My, my, what a pretty knife.
- Would you like a closer look?{\r}

295
00:36:52,114 --> 00:36:54,658
{\fs14}大家规矩点！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Let's keep this pot looking like a ship of the line!{\r}

296
00:36:55,284 --> 00:36:56,785
{\fs14}上来{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Come up here.{\r}

297
00:37:02,166 --> 00:37:03,417
{\fs14}跳过去！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Hop to it!{\r}

298
00:37:11,717 --> 00:37:14,053
{\fs14}我来谈谈埃尔·利布勒{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I came up to talk about El Libre.{\r}

299
00:37:19,183 --> 00:37:22,311
{\fs14}- 继续，我在听   - 你有救他的计划吗？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- Go ahead. I'm listening.
- You have a plan to save him?{\r}

300
00:37:22,937 --> 00:37:26,065
{\fs14}计划和价格，光是军火就值5万{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}A plan and a price. Guns alone will cost 50,000.{\r}

301
00:37:26,149 --> 00:37:30,027
{\fs14}那是一大笔军火费，你打算向埃尔·利布勒开多少价？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}That's a great deal of money for guns. How much are you asking for El Libre?{\r}

302
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:32,739
{\fs14}嗯，对，埃尔·利布勒{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, yes, El Libre.{\r}

303
00:37:33,489 --> 00:37:35,116
{\fs14}救他就算顺带吧{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I'll throw him in for nothing.{\r}

304
00:37:36,617 --> 00:37:38,119
{\fs14}很好，船长{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Very well, Captain.{\r}

305
00:37:38,202 --> 00:37:40,663
{\fs14}我会把钱和他一起安排的{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I'll see that the money is arranged with him.{\r}

306
00:37:40,747 --> 00:37:43,249
{\fs14}你可以确信他会遵守协议的{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}You may be sure that he'll honor the agreement.{\r}

307
00:37:44,167 --> 00:37:45,585
{\fs14}你的计划是什么？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}What's your plan?{\r}

308
00:37:50,298 --> 00:37:52,550
{\fs14}你昨晚为什么把舱门闩上？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Why did you bolt your cabin door last night?{\r}

309
00:37:52,842 --> 00:37:55,553
{\fs14}如果你知道那是用螺栓固定的，那说明你一定试过打开门{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}If you know it was bolted, you must've tried it.{\r}

310
00:37:55,678 --> 00:37:58,181
{\fs14}如果你试过打开门，那你就知道为什么要锁上门了{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}And if you tried it, you know why it was bolted.{\r}

311
00:38:01,226 --> 00:38:03,269
{\fs14}你打算怎么救埃尔·利布勒？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}How do you propose to get El Libre?{\r}

312
00:38:03,853 --> 00:38:05,814
{\fs14}你的门只对他开吗？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Is your door open only to him?{\r}

313
00:38:07,148 --> 00:38:08,316
{\fs14}什么意思？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}What do you mean?{\r}

314
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,028
{\fs14}对一个人如此关心，不可能完全因为政治{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}So much concern about one man can't be entirely political.{\r}

315
00:38:12,571 --> 00:38:14,156
{\fs14}他是你的情人{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}He's your lover.{\r}

316
00:38:14,698 --> 00:38:15,740
{\fs14}不{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}No.{\r}

317
00:38:16,491 --> 00:38:18,034
{\fs14}他是我的父亲{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}He's my father.{\r}

318
00:38:19,828 --> 00:38:21,121
{\fs14}船长！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Captain!{\r}

319
00:38:25,667 --> 00:38:27,127
{\fs14}陆地！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Land ho!{\r}

320
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:45,979
{\fs14}站起来，小伙子们，注意！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}On your feet, lads. Attention!{\r}

321
00:38:51,652 --> 00:38:54,321
{\fs14}你们应该是国王的手下，而不是吟游诗人{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}You're supposed to be king's men, not bard slabs.{\r}

322
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:56,699
{\fs14}穿制服要像模像样{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Look like you belong in those uniforms.{\r}

323
00:39:09,587 --> 00:39:12,798
{\fs14}奥约，向驻军发信号，说格鲁达男爵已经到达...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Ojo, signal to the garrison that Baron Gruda has arrived...{\r}

324
00:39:13,174 --> 00:39:14,884
{\fs14}叫他们把埃尔·利布勒押过来{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}to take El Libre into custody.{\r}

325
00:39:27,522 --> 00:39:30,525
{\fs14}- 我父亲怎么样了？  - 我命令你待在下面{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- What about my father?
- I ordered you to stay below.{\r}

326
00:39:32,944 --> 00:39:34,904
{\fs14}他们在发什么信号？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}What are they signaling?{\r}

327
00:39:36,823 --> 00:39:40,326
{\fs14}驻军指挥官希望为格鲁达男爵举行晚宴以表敬意{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}The garrison commander wishes to give a dinner in honor of Baron Gruda.{\r}

328
00:39:41,285 --> 00:39:43,246
{\fs14}我们该怎么办？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}What are we going to do?{\r}

329
00:39:44,497 --> 00:39:46,916
{\fs14}我们当然接受{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}We're going to accept, of course.{\r}

330
00:40:24,746 --> 00:40:26,623
{\fs14}格鲁达男爵和他的小妞...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Baron Gruda and his bit of fluff...{\r}

331
00:40:26,665 --> 00:40:29,876
{\fs14}在船上留下了足够的衣服来愚弄国王本人{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}left enough clothes onboard to fool the King himself.{\r}

332
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,545
{\fs14}如果有人认出我们...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}If anyone recognizes us...{\r}

333
00:40:31,628 --> 00:40:34,798
{\fs14}我们要脱光这些衣服以便行动，把埃尔·利布勒强行带走{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}we'll be stripping for action and taking El Libre the hard way.{\r}

334
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:45,726
{\fs14}一群精英，上尉，一群精英{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}A fine body of men, Captain. A fine body of men.{\r}

335
00:41:19,301 --> 00:41:23,306
{\fs14}格鲁达男爵阁下莅临{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}His Excellency Baron Gruda and party.{\r}

336
00:41:40,031 --> 00:41:41,866
{\fs14}欢迎光临，阁下{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Welcome, Your Excellency.{\r}

337
00:41:41,949 --> 00:41:45,411
{\fs14}我们大家很荣幸终于见到你{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}It is a great honor for all of us to meet you at last.{\r}

338
00:41:45,453 --> 00:41:48,498
{\fs14}很高兴你能接受我们的盛情款待{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}It gives us great pleasure that you accept our hospitality.{\r}

339
00:41:48,581 --> 00:41:51,417
{\fs14}恰恰相反，亲爱的上校，感到荣幸的是我{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}On the contrary, my dear Colonel, it is I who am accepted.{\r}

340
00:41:51,501 --> 00:41:54,420
{\fs14}噢，不，阁下，我是幸运的{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, no, Your Excellency. I am the lucky one.{\r}

341
00:41:55,255 --> 00:41:59,717
{\fs14}我接到眼镜蛇岛总督的指示，要我处决埃尔·利布勒{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I had instructions from the Governor of Cobra to execute El Libre.{\r}

342
00:42:00,468 --> 00:42:03,513
{\fs14}我收到你的信息那会儿，正准备执行呢{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I was on the verge of doing so when I got your message.{\r}

343
00:42:03,596 --> 00:42:06,474
{\fs14}总督是个白痴！我要撤掉他...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}The Governor is an idiot! I may replace him...{\r}

344
00:42:07,767 --> 00:42:09,102
{\fs14}换成一位军方人士{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}with a military man.{\r}

345
00:42:09,853 --> 00:42:12,856
{\fs14}- 亲爱的侯爵   - 亲爱的上校{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- My dear Baron.
- My dear Colonel.{\r}

346
00:42:18,445 --> 00:42:21,656
{\fs14}- 我可以把你介绍给我们的客人吗？   - 悉听尊便{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- May I introduce you to our guests?
- By all means.{\r}

347
00:42:32,793 --> 00:42:35,253
{\fs14}- 阁下   - 阁下{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- Your Excellency.
- Your Excellency.{\r}

348
00:43:02,281 --> 00:43:05,743
{\fs14}但我在这里很难为国王征税{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}But I have so much trouble collecting the King's taxes here.{\r}

349
00:43:05,826 --> 00:43:08,871
{\fs14}告诉我，伯爵，人们待在家里怎么付钱？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Tell me, Count. How do the people pay at home?{\r}

350
00:43:12,291 --> 00:43:15,044
{\fs14}牵着鼻子！牵着他们的鼻子付钱！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Through the nose! They pay through the nose!{\r}

351
00:43:16,754 --> 00:43:18,589
{\fs14}真是太好了！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}That's really very good!{\r}

352
00:43:22,802 --> 00:43:25,012
{\fs14}这个游戏我们还要玩多久？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}How long do we have to play this game?{\r}

353
00:43:27,014 --> 00:43:29,600
{\fs14}直到上校决定移交埃尔·利布勒{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Till the Colonel decides to hand over El Libre.{\r}

354
00:43:29,684 --> 00:43:31,269
{\fs14}我很害怕{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I am frightened.{\r}

355
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:58,171
{\fs14}伯爵一定让你笑口常开{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}The Count must be a constant delight to you.{\r}

356
00:43:58,213 --> 00:44:00,507
{\fs14}他真是太搞笑了{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}He's really too funny for words.{\r}

357
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:01,799
{\fs14}的确如此{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Indeed he is.{\r}

358
00:44:01,883 --> 00:44:03,218
{\fs14}一定要告诉我们，伯爵{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Do tell us, Count.{\r}

359
00:44:03,301 --> 00:44:06,679
{\fs14}王后这几天外出时穿什么？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}What does the Queen wear when she goes out these days?{\r}

360
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:11,893
{\fs14}伯爵总是说王后使国王疲惫不堪{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}The Count always says the Queen wears the King out.{\r}

361
00:44:12,268 --> 00:44:14,187
{\fs14}你真是个妙人！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}You are the wittiest man!{\r}

362
00:44:17,399 --> 00:44:21,069
{\fs14}女士们，先生们，大家请注意{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please.{\r}

363
00:44:22,362 --> 00:44:26,366
{\fs14}为了纪念格鲁达男爵的来访给我们带来的荣誉...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}To commemorate the honor Baron Gruda has done us by his visit...{\r}

364
00:44:26,867 --> 00:44:31,538
{\fs14}圣西奥驻军的军官们为他安排了一件小礼物{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}the officers of the Saint Theo garrison have arranged a little gift for him.{\r}

365
00:44:32,789 --> 00:44:35,375
{\fs14}请大家都到这边来好吗？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Will everyone come this way, please?{\r}

366
00:44:50,057 --> 00:44:51,183
{\fs14}左边...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}On the left...{\r}

367
00:44:51,266 --> 00:44:55,896
{\fs14}是热爱民主和人民的伟人，埃尔·利布勒{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}you have that great lover of democracy and the people, El Libre.{\r}

368
00:44:56,396 --> 00:44:59,566
{\fs14}而右边，是杰出的科学家...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}And on the right, that distinguished scientist...{\r}

369
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:01,694
{\fs14}普鲁登斯教授{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Professor Prudence.{\r}

370
00:45:02,361 --> 00:45:04,780
{\fs14}他俩都像被困在陷阱里的老鼠...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Both caught like rats in a trap...{\r}

371
00:45:04,989 --> 00:45:09,201
{\fs14}阴谋反对国王陛下的伟大荣耀{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}conspiring against the greater glory of His Majesty.{\r}

372
00:45:09,952 --> 00:45:13,247
{\fs14}但多亏了格鲁达男爵这样的政治家...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}But thanks to statesmen like Baron Gruda...{\r}

373
00:45:13,789 --> 00:45:18,294
{\fs14}这些人，这些思想，很快就会被摧毁{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}such men and such ideas will soon be destroyed.{\r}

374
00:45:19,253 --> 00:45:20,963
{\fs14}作为一个杰出的科学家...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}As a distinguished scientist...{\r}

375
00:45:21,046 --> 00:45:25,509
{\fs14}我可以向你们保证，思想是没有可被摧毁的物理性质的{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I can assure you an idea has no physical properties which can be destroyed.{\r}

376
00:45:25,593 --> 00:45:28,512
{\fs14}作为一个热爱民主和人民的人，我可以向你们保证...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}As a lover of democracy and the people, I can assure you...{\r}

377
00:45:28,596 --> 00:45:30,973
{\fs14}两者都能在你们可怜的阻挠下继续存在{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}both will survive your puny efforts.{\r}

378
00:45:32,266 --> 00:45:35,853
{\fs14}作为一个政治家，我可以向你们保证，没有人能预言未来{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}As a statesman, I can assure you that no one can foretell the future.{\r}

379
00:45:35,937 --> 00:45:39,482
{\fs14}但是，你们现在的命运对我来说是很清楚的...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}However, your fate at present is as clear to me...{\r}

380
00:45:40,107 --> 00:45:42,693
{\fs14}就好像这个美丽的女士在我身边{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}as the face of this beautiful lady at my side.{\r}

381
00:45:42,777 --> 00:45:44,195
{\fs14}好极了！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Bravo!{\r}

382
00:45:44,278 --> 00:45:46,989
{\fs14}谢谢，阁下{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Thank you, Your Excellency.{\r}

383
00:45:51,577 --> 00:45:54,580
{\fs14}是的，她很美丽{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Yes. She is very beautiful.{\r}

384
00:45:56,124 --> 00:45:57,959
{\fs14}阁下言之有理{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}His Excellency has a point.{\r}

385
00:45:58,042 --> 00:46:02,088
{\fs14}当我们的命运如此明显地掌握在他手中时，与命运争吵是愚蠢的{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}It's foolish to quarrel with fate when ours is so clearly in his hands.{\r}

386
00:46:03,673 --> 00:46:07,677
{\fs14}把他们带出去，让他们取悦格鲁达男爵{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Take them outside and hold them for Baron Gruda's pleasure.{\r}

387
00:46:12,515 --> 00:46:16,019
{\fs14}亲爱的上校，谢谢你给了我一个非常有意义的夜晚{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}My dear Colonel, thank you for a most rewarding evening.{\r}

388
00:46:16,102 --> 00:46:19,105
{\fs14}- 现在我们必须走了   - 还远远没有结束呢{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- And now we must go.
- It is by no means over.{\r}

389
00:46:19,189 --> 00:46:21,900
{\fs14}我为这个非常特别的场合...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I've arranged a very special entertainment...{\r}

390
00:46:21,983 --> 00:46:24,069
{\fs14}安排了一个非常特别的娱乐活动{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}for this very special occasion.{\r}

391
00:46:46,675 --> 00:46:48,844
{\fs14}是我们为了赎金而抓的那个女人{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}It's that dame we held for ransom.{\r}

392
00:46:59,855 --> 00:47:00,981
{\fs14}开溜{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Abandon ship.{\r}

393
00:47:01,064 --> 00:47:04,068
{\fs14}- 谢谢，亲爱的上校    - 阁下{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- Thank you, my dear Colonel.
- Your Excellency!{\r}

394
00:47:04,610 --> 00:47:08,197
{\fs14}- 但是，亲爱的侯爵！  - 美好的夜晚，上校{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- But, my dear Baron!
- Wonderful evening, Colonel.{\r}

395
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,406
{\fs14}瓦洛！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Vallo!{\r}

396
00:47:15,537 --> 00:47:16,747
{\fs14}但是，阁下{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}But, Your Excellency.{\r}

397
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:20,543
{\fs14}意想不到的国际事务，总是发生在我们外交官身上{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Unexpected international affairs. Happens to us diplomats all the time.{\r}

398
00:47:24,797 --> 00:47:27,258
{\fs14}- 把犯人带到我的车厢里   - 是，是，先生{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- Put the prisoners in my carriage.
- Aye, aye, sir.{\r}

399
00:47:34,932 --> 00:47:38,060
{\fs14}我真希望国王能听到这件事，阁下{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I do hope the King will hear about this, Your Excellency.{\r}

400
00:47:38,144 --> 00:47:39,520
{\fs14}别担心，他会听到的{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Don't worry, he will.{\r}

401
00:47:41,022 --> 00:47:43,941
{\fs14}放开我，你这只臭虾{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Unclutch me, you polluted shrimp.{\r}

402
00:47:46,777 --> 00:47:48,571
{\fs14}阻止他，你们这些蠢货！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Stop him, you fools!{\r}

403
00:47:48,988 --> 00:47:51,157
{\fs14}他是红海盗！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}He's the Crimson Pirate!{\r}

404
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:52,950
{\fs14}红海盗？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}The Crimson Pirate?{\r}

405
00:48:01,125 --> 00:48:03,878
{\fs14}红海盗！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}The Crimson Pirate!{\r}

406
00:48:05,964 --> 00:48:07,966
{\fs14}把上校带到安全的地方，快点，伙计{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Take the Colonel to safety. Quick, man.{\r}

407
00:48:09,968 --> 00:48:13,263
{\fs14}- 把上校带到安全的地方！   - 放开我，你们这些蠢货！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- Take the Colonel to safety!
- Let me go, you fools!{\r}

408
00:48:14,472 --> 00:48:17,225
{\fs14}别担心，上校，我会照顾好一切的！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Don't worry, Colonel. I'll take care of everything!{\r}

409
00:48:17,308 --> 00:48:20,395
{\fs14}- 拉威尔公民，去救伯爵！   - 去救伯爵！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- Citizen Ravel, save the Count!
- Save the Count!{\r}

410
00:48:29,446 --> 00:48:31,990
{\fs14}- 大人！大人！  - 干得好，上尉{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- Sire! Sire!
- Good work, Captain.{\r}

411
00:48:32,282 --> 00:48:34,951
{\fs14}阻止他！有红海盗！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Stop him! There's the Crimson Pirate!{\r}

412
00:48:35,535 --> 00:48:36,787
{\fs14}上尉！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Captain!{\r}

413
00:48:38,497 --> 00:48:40,749
{\fs14}军官们哗变，粉碎他们！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}The officers are mutinying. Crush them!{\r}

414
00:48:42,042 --> 00:48:43,794
{\fs14}粉碎他们！快！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Crush them! Come on!{\r}

415
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:46,797
{\fs14}吹进攻号！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Sound the attack!{\r}

416
00:48:50,467 --> 00:48:53,637
{\fs14}守住城堡，寸土不让，保护妇女和儿童{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Hold the fort. Don't give an inch. Protect the women and children.{\r}

417
00:48:53,679 --> 00:48:56,682
{\fs14}增援部队正在赶来，锁上门！不让任何人出去{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Reinforcements are on the way. Lock the gates! Let no one out.{\r}

418
00:48:56,723 --> 00:48:58,725
{\fs14}锁上门！不许让任何人出去！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Lock the gates! Let no one out!{\r}

419
00:48:58,809 --> 00:49:02,104
{\fs14}国王万岁！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Long live the King!{\r}

420
00:49:06,358 --> 00:49:08,986
{\fs14}我想我们还没见过面，我叫普鲁登斯{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I don't think we've met. My name is Prudence.{\r}

421
00:49:09,069 --> 00:49:11,322
{\fs14}瓦洛船长，为你效劳{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Captain Vallo, at your service.{\r}

422
00:49:13,449 --> 00:49:14,783
{\fs14}谢谢{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Thank you.{\r}

423
00:49:47,191 --> 00:49:49,152
{\fs14}你龇着牙笑什么？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}What are you grinning at?{\r}

424
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:57,326
{\fs14}这样，我得到一个光环，你怕我变软了{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}So, I'm getting a halo. You're afraid I'm getting soft.{\r}

425
00:49:58,202 --> 00:49:59,912
{\fs14}是的，你错了{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah, you're wrong.{\r}

426
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:05,752
{\fs14}这只是一种新的把戏，这些人让我心烦意乱{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}It's just that this is a new kind of caper. These people are getting on my nerves.{\r}

427
00:50:06,377 --> 00:50:08,713
{\fs14}埃尔·利布勒和他的女儿是规矩的生意人{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}El Libre and his daughter are strictly business.{\r}

428
00:50:10,381 --> 00:50:13,676
{\fs14}他们没有缠住我，是我把他们缠住了{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}They haven't got me chained. I've got them chained.{\r}

429
00:50:14,385 --> 00:50:16,513
{\fs14}我很快就会摆脱他们{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I'll be rid of them soon enough.{\r}

430
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:19,390
{\fs14}明天，我会亲自把他们送给格鲁达男爵{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Tomorrow, I'm delivering them to Baron Gruda personally.{\r}

431
00:50:20,683 --> 00:50:22,394
{\fs14}你在说什么？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}What are you talking about?{\r}

432
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:49,629
{\fs14}姑娘？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}The girl?{\r}

433
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:55,594
{\fs14}姑娘怎么了？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}What about the girl?{\r}

434
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,350
{\fs14}她在我的眼皮底下{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}She's getting under my skin.{\r}

435
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:04,561
{\fs14}她把疯狂的想法灌输给我{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}She's putting crazy ideas in my head.{\r}

436
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:09,483
{\fs14}她打开了我的心扉，她离我很近{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}She's unlocked my heart. She's getting too close to me.{\r}

437
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:12,444
{\fs14}她让我着迷{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}She's got me hooked.{\r}

438
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:15,948
{\fs14}她瞎了{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}She's blind.{\r}

439
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:19,159
{\fs14}我瞎了，你瞎了{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I'm blind. You're blind.{\r}

440
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:21,453
{\fs14}谁瞎了？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Who's blind?{\r}

441
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:26,458
{\fs14}啊！爱是盲目的{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Oh! Love is blind.{\r}

442
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:29,962
{\fs14}我没有堕入爱河！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I am not in love!{\r}

443
00:52:16,968 --> 00:52:18,344
{\fs14}停下！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Avast there!{\r}

444
00:52:20,138 --> 00:52:23,475
{\fs14}我告诉过你们不要那么吵，现在船长要得到她了{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I told you not to make so much noise. Now the Skipper will get her.{\r}

445
00:52:23,558 --> 00:52:25,643
{\fs14}- 他总是这样   - 没人能得到她{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- He always does.
- Nobody will get her.{\r}

446
00:52:32,942 --> 00:52:34,611
{\fs14}把其他的解开，快去！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Untie the others. Move!{\r}

447
00:52:34,694 --> 00:52:36,488
{\fs14}怎么了？我玩得很开心{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}What's up? I'm having a little fun.{\r}

448
00:52:36,571 --> 00:52:40,033
{\fs14}- 来吧，船长，让我们玩得开心点   - 你想吃独食？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- Come on, Skipper. Let us have some fun.
- You want her all to yourself?{\r}

449
00:52:40,116 --> 00:52:43,328
{\fs14}- 你为什么不参加这个活动呢？   - 你为什么不自己试试呢？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- Why don't you join the fun?
- Why don't you try yourself?{\r}

450
00:52:43,411 --> 00:52:47,040
{\fs14}- 你总是说你做不到    - 总是工作，没有乐趣{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- You always tell that you couldn't make it.
- Always work and no fun.{\r}

451
00:53:00,178 --> 00:53:03,724
{\fs14}贝洛斯先生，把这三个都带到下面船舱，然后把船舱钥匙给我{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Mr. Bellows, take all three below and bring me the cabin keys.{\r}

452
00:53:03,891 --> 00:53:06,476
{\fs14}原谅我指出一点，船长...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}If you'll forgive my pointing it out, Skipper...{\r}

453
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:09,897
{\fs14}我们不能让一个漂亮的女人在船上不被骚扰{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}we can't leave a pretty woman unmolested aboard ship.{\r}

454
00:53:10,355 --> 00:53:12,649
{\fs14}这会败坏我们海盗的名声{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}It will give piracy a bad name.{\r}

455
00:53:12,775 --> 00:53:14,610
{\fs14}你在挑战我的命令吗？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Are you challenging my orders?{\r}

456
00:53:16,361 --> 00:53:18,572
{\fs14}我永远不会那样做的，船长…{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I'd never do that, Skipper...{\r}

457
00:53:18,822 --> 00:53:22,785
{\fs14}但既然你要把这些鸽子卖给格鲁达男爵...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}but seeing thou is selling these pigeons to Baron Gruda anyway...{\r}

458
00:53:22,868 --> 00:53:26,664
{\fs14}我想先和他们一起运动运动不会有什么坏处{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I thought there could be no harm to sport with them a bit first.{\r}

459
00:53:28,332 --> 00:53:30,084
{\fs14}不是冒犯，船长{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}No offense, Skipper.{\r}

460
00:53:45,057 --> 00:53:48,227
{\fs14}我明天会把你放在科布拉上岸，并把军火给你{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I'm putting you ashore tomorrow at Cobra and giving you the guns.{\r}

461
00:53:49,312 --> 00:53:50,688
{\fs14}你们所有人{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}All of you.{\r}

462
00:53:52,398 --> 00:53:54,150
{\fs14}不要谢我{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Just don't thank me.{\r}

463
00:54:33,189 --> 00:54:34,441
{\fs14}船长{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Skipper.{\r}

464
00:54:43,533 --> 00:54:46,703
{\fs14}是的，那是我们的船，格鲁达男爵在等你{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Yes, there's our ship. With Baron Gruda waiting.{\r}

465
00:54:47,204 --> 00:54:49,122
{\fs14}难道他不愿意为埃尔·利布勒付钱...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Won't he hate paying for El Libre...{\r}

466
00:54:49,206 --> 00:54:52,918
{\fs14}如果他知道我们已经把埃尔·利布勒从国王的监狱里偷走？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}when he finds out we stole him out of one of the King's own prisons?{\r}

467
00:54:56,046 --> 00:54:59,841
{\fs14}- 我们要顶风停船面向他们直到天黑   - 是，是，船长{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- We'll heave to onto the point till nightfall.
- Aye, aye, Skipper.{\r}

468
00:55:04,846 --> 00:55:06,014
{\fs14}斯莱米{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Slimey.{\r}

469
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:20,404
{\fs14}- 让我们看着你游到那边岛上   -好，然后再回来{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- Let's see thee swim to yonder island.
- Aye, and back again.{\r}

470
00:55:20,904 --> 00:55:24,700
{\fs14}如果我的计划成功，格鲁达男爵会亲自护送你回来{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}If my plan works, Baron Gruda himself will escort thee back.{\r}

471
00:55:25,159 --> 00:55:27,202
{\fs14}我要你给他捎封信{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I've a message for thee to give to him.{\r}

472
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:30,289
{\fs14}去做吧，等我当上船长...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Do it, and when I am skipper...{\r}

473
00:55:30,497 --> 00:55:32,208
{\fs14}你将是大副{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}thou wilt be first mate.{\r}

474
00:55:35,669 --> 00:55:37,171
{\fs14}贝洛斯先生...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Mr. Bellows...{\r}

475
00:55:39,215 --> 00:55:42,343
{\fs14}- 遇到鲨鱼怎么办？  - 它们从不攻击人{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- what about sharks?
- They never attack a man.{\r}

476
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:45,221
{\fs14}除非人先攻击它们{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Unless he attacks them first.{\r}

477
00:55:56,023 --> 00:55:57,775
{\fs14}- 总督   - 男爵，什么事？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- Governor.
- Baron?{\r}

478
00:55:58,484 --> 00:56:02,113
{\fs14}- 把他送到厨房，喂饱他    - 厨房，喂饱他{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- Send him to the kitchen and feed him.
- Kitchen. Feed him.{\r}

479
00:56:05,324 --> 00:56:07,869
{\fs14}你要准备好10万金弗罗林给他们{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}You'll have the 100,000 gold florin ready for them.{\r}

480
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:10,204
{\fs14}悉听阁下吩咐{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Whatever Your Excellency orders.{\r}

481
00:56:10,288 --> 00:56:14,042
{\fs14}- 但这是彻头彻尾的海盗   - 我向你保证...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- But this is sheer piracy.
- I assure you...{\r}

482
00:56:14,167 --> 00:56:17,837
{\fs14}我会得到埃尔·利布勒，他的女儿，他杰出的同谋...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I shall have El Libre, his daughter, his distinguished conspirator...{\r}

483
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:22,300
{\fs14}我们的船，我们的军火，海盗，还有瓦洛船长，不用付一分钱{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}our ship, our guns, the pirates, and Captain Vallo, without paying a sou.{\r}

484
00:56:22,592 --> 00:56:25,762
{\fs14}- 那为什么还要准备10万金弗罗林？  - 我说过，把钱准备好{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- Then why 100,000?
- Have the money ready, I said.{\r}

485
00:56:27,639 --> 00:56:31,559
{\fs14}大副认为他可以推翻瓦洛，但他的计划可能失败{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}The first mate thinks he can undo Vallo, but his plan may fail.{\r}

486
00:56:32,393 --> 00:56:35,980
{\fs14}即使我们必须支付，这样的价格也会便宜一倍{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Even if we have to pay, such a haul would be cheap at double the price.{\r}

487
00:56:36,064 --> 00:56:37,524
{\fs14}顺便说一句...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}By the way...{\r}

488
00:56:38,024 --> 00:56:41,277
{\fs14}我要一桶这种药，彻底麻醉{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I shall want a barrel of this, well drugged.{\r}

489
00:56:49,661 --> 00:56:51,746
{\fs14}- 你处理瓦洛船长了？  - 没有{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- You disposed of Captain Vallo?
- No.{\r}

490
00:56:51,830 --> 00:56:54,916
{\fs14}在全体船员面前揭发他是必要的{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}It will be necessary to expose him to the crew first.{\r}

491
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:59,004
{\fs14}如果你听从我的建议，我很快就会做的{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Which I'll be doing soon enough, if thou has followed my instructions.{\r}

492
00:56:59,087 --> 00:57:00,589
{\fs14}一言为定{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}To the letter.{\r}

493
00:57:00,922 --> 00:57:03,800
{\fs14}钱呢？请原谅我的急躁{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}And the money? If you'll forgive my impatience.{\r}

494
00:57:03,884 --> 00:57:06,053
{\fs14}那些钱会在明天早上等着你{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}It will be waiting for you in the morning.{\r}

495
00:57:06,136 --> 00:57:09,389
{\fs14}并且，我把自己放在你手里作为保证{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Meanwhile, I place myself in your hands as security for it.{\r}

496
00:57:09,473 --> 00:57:10,807
{\fs14}很好{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Very well.{\r}

497
00:57:10,891 --> 00:57:14,478
{\fs14}但我还是得提醒你，如果我的手空着，它们会十分凶残{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}But I remind thee, they be murderous hands when they're empty.{\r}

498
00:57:16,188 --> 00:57:18,190
{\fs14}把大人藏在下面{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Hide His Excellency below.{\r}

499
00:57:49,555 --> 00:57:53,517
{\fs14}一旦甲板清理干净，奥约将带着一艘小船在下面待命{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}As soon as it's clear topside, Ojo will stand by below with a small boat.{\r}

500
00:57:53,559 --> 00:57:56,562
{\fs14}离海岸很近了，去叫你父亲{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}It's a short pull to shore. Call your father.{\r}

501
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:32,599
{\fs14}瓦洛，跟我们一起走，加入我们{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Come with us. Join us.{\r}

502
00:58:34,684 --> 00:58:35,685
{\fs14}不{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}No.{\r}

503
00:58:37,562 --> 00:58:40,440
{\fs14}但你想这样做，我知道你想这样做{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}But you want to. I know you want to.{\r}

504
00:58:41,608 --> 00:58:43,068
{\fs14}你错了{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}You're wrong.{\r}

505
00:58:43,943 --> 00:58:46,947
{\fs14}我毫无兴趣，去找你父亲{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}There's nothing in it for me. Get your father.{\r}

506
00:58:51,743 --> 00:58:53,787
{\fs14}那你为什么要放我们自由？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Then why are you setting us free?{\r}

507
00:58:53,870 --> 00:58:57,249
{\fs14}- 我信守诺言，即便是愚蠢的诺言   - 你并没有许诺{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- I keep my promises, even foolish ones.
- You made no promise.{\r}

508
00:58:57,332 --> 00:59:00,419
{\fs14}你有一个出卖我们的交易，但你完不成这个交易了{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}You made a deal to sell us, and you can't do it.{\r}

509
00:59:00,752 --> 00:59:04,589
{\fs14}那好吧，我是为你才这么做的，就这样吧{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}All right, then. I'm doing it for you. Let's leave it at that.{\r}

510
00:59:05,590 --> 00:59:08,427
{\fs14}不，瓦洛，我们不能就这样离开{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}No, Vallo. We can't leave it at that.{\r}

511
00:59:09,177 --> 00:59:11,513
{\fs14}你是一个战士，和我们一起战斗吧{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}You're a fighter. Fight with us.{\r}

512
00:59:12,097 --> 00:59:14,516
{\fs14}- 为公平正义而奋斗   - 我不{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- Fight for something decent.
- Not I.{\r}

513
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:19,229
{\fs14}我一生中看到都是公平正义旗帜下不公正和不诚实的行为{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}All my life I've watched injustice and dishonesty fly the flag of decency.{\r}

514
00:59:19,271 --> 00:59:22,149
{\fs14}- 我不相信什么公平正义   - 你相信我吗？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- I don't trust them.
- Don't you trust me?{\r}

515
00:59:25,194 --> 00:59:28,113
{\fs14}难道你不相信我们彼此拥有的东西吗？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Don't you trust what we have for each other?{\r}

516
00:59:28,238 --> 00:59:31,492
{\fs14}我们必须忘掉我们彼此拥有的东西{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}What we have for each other we'll have to get over.{\r}

517
00:59:33,911 --> 00:59:35,120
{\fs14}我们能做到吗？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Can we?{\r}

518
00:59:53,472 --> 00:59:55,850
{\fs14}你说得对，我不会让你走的{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}You're right. I won't let you go.{\r}

519
00:59:56,851 --> 01:00:00,646
{\fs14}我们属于这里，在我的船上，我们会找到办法的{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}We belong together here, aboard my ship. We'll find a way.{\r}

520
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:04,317
{\fs14}但那是不可能的{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}But that's not possible.{\r}

521
01:00:05,568 --> 01:00:09,697
{\fs14}- 我不能待在这里，你想不明白吗？  -是的，我明白{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- I can't stay here. Don't you see?
- Yes, I see.{\r}

522
01:00:11,115 --> 01:00:13,451
{\fs14}现在，你终于也明白了{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}And now, at last, you see it, too.{\r}

523
01:00:14,327 --> 01:00:17,121
{\fs14}你拥有你的世界，我拥有我的世界{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}You've got your world, and I've got mine.{\r}

524
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:24,253
{\fs14}好了，先生们{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}All right, gentlemen.{\r}

525
01:00:27,799 --> 01:00:29,050
{\fs14}坐下{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Sit down.{\r}

526
01:00:31,094 --> 01:00:33,972
{\fs14}教授，你稍后上岸，与帕布罗·墨菲和军火一道{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Professor, you'll go ashore later with Pablo Murphy and the guns.{\r}

527
01:00:34,013 --> 01:00:36,850
{\fs14}- 行   - 继续大声自言自语{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- Right.
- Keep talking to yourself, loudly.{\r}

528
01:00:36,933 --> 01:00:39,394
{\fs14}我想让我的人以为你们还在这里{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I want my men to think you're all still here.{\r}

529
01:00:39,477 --> 01:00:41,479
{\fs14}这对我来说没问题{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}That's no problem for me.{\r}

530
01:00:41,688 --> 01:00:44,399
{\fs14}现在，记住，这是一个危险的游戏{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Now, remember, this is a dangerous game.{\r}

531
01:00:44,566 --> 01:00:48,069
{\fs14}如果我的人发现被坑，他们会割断你们的喉咙，对我也一样{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}If my men tumble to it, they'll slit your throats, and mine, too.{\r}

532
01:00:48,153 --> 01:00:50,113
{\fs14}我不喜欢这样，船长{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I don't like it, Captain.{\r}

533
01:00:50,572 --> 01:00:54,075
{\fs14}我们不能让你独自面对他们，跟我们走吧{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}We can't leave you to face them alone. Come with us.{\r}

534
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:56,411
{\fs14}父亲{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Father...{\r}

535
01:00:56,953 --> 01:00:57,996
{\fs14}不要劝了{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}don't.{\r}

536
01:01:44,919 --> 01:01:46,670
{\fs14}停下！操炮！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Avast! Man the guns!{\r}

537
01:01:54,428 --> 01:01:56,180
{\fs14}外舷，观测！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Topside, you swabs!{\r}

538
01:02:10,611 --> 01:02:11,737
{\fs14}救命！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Help!{\r}

539
01:02:17,326 --> 01:02:20,705
{\fs14}别忙乎了，船长，原谅我打搅{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Not so fast, Skipper, if you'll pardon the intrusion.{\r}

540
01:02:41,142 --> 01:02:44,687
{\fs14}你出卖我，谦卑的贝洛斯，把我卖给国王的奴才{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}You've sold me, Humble Bellows, and to a king's flunky.{\r}

541
01:02:44,771 --> 01:02:45,814
{\fs14}是的{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Aye.{\r}

542
01:02:46,314 --> 01:02:50,026
{\fs14}我谦虚地认为，没有人能像海盗那样色彩斑斓...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}'Tis my modest opinion that no man can fly pirate's colors...{\r}

543
01:02:50,110 --> 01:02:54,114
{\fs14}谁也不愿意卖他的朋友，他的心上人，或者他的母亲{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}who's not willing to sell his friend, his sweetheart, or his mother.{\r}

544
01:02:54,197 --> 01:02:57,200
{\fs14}- 说得好，贝洛斯先生   - 满嘴喷粪{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- Well spoken, Mr. Bellows.
- Foul spoken it is.{\r}

545
01:02:57,576 --> 01:03:00,120
{\fs14}你已经把手放在船长背上了{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}You've turned your hand against your Captain's back.{\r}

546
01:03:00,203 --> 01:03:02,289
{\fs14}黄色永远不是海盗的颜色{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Yellow was never a pirate's color.{\r}

547
01:03:02,414 --> 01:03:05,250
{\fs14}也挽救不了一个美丽少女一个海盗的把戏{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Nor rescuing a fair maiden a pirate caper.{\r}

548
01:03:06,042 --> 01:03:07,127
{\fs14}是的{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Aye.{\r}

549
01:03:07,919 --> 01:03:10,672
{\fs14}这是真的，我驶向了我的深渊…{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}It's true. I sailed beyond my depth...{\r}

550
01:03:12,174 --> 01:03:15,052
{\fs14}但只是为我们许多人开辟新的水域{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}but only to sound out new waters for the lot of us.{\r}

551
01:03:15,135 --> 01:03:19,348
{\fs14}即便是我们快要饿死了，我也不会出卖你们{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}If we'd have starved to death, I'd have never sold a man jack of you.{\r}

552
01:03:21,725 --> 01:03:25,687
{\fs14}集合，小伙子们，这并不是海盗最后一次胡闹{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Gather round, lads. This isn't the last of the pirate capers.{\r}

553
01:03:25,729 --> 01:03:28,524
{\fs14}这是你和你的跟班的末日...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}'Tis the last of thee and of thy capers...{\r}

554
01:03:28,982 --> 01:03:33,278
{\fs14}当你试图剥夺我们的战利品时，他们就被迫投票了{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}for 'twas put to the vote whilst thee was trying to deprive us of our loot.{\r}

555
01:03:33,362 --> 01:03:37,408
{\fs14}你放过一条肥鱼，违反了海盗守则{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Ye violated the pirate code by letting a fat fish off the hook.{\r}

556
01:03:38,701 --> 01:03:41,662
{\fs14}通过投票，你们被剥夺了指挥权...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}By vote of all, ye are deprived of command...{\r}

557
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:46,333
{\fs14}并且，根据海盗法判处你们乘坐一艘小船漂流...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}and sentenced under piratical law to be cast adrift in a small boat...{\r}

558
01:03:47,001 --> 01:03:48,878
{\fs14}不给食物和水{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}without food or water.{\r}

559
01:03:51,505 --> 01:03:55,551
{\fs14}很好的决定，贝洛斯先生，迅速的正义和必定的死亡{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}A splendid decision, Mr. Bellows. Quick justice and certain death.{\r}

560
01:03:56,385 --> 01:04:00,723
{\fs14}也许你可以帮国王节省绞死这个有学问的傻瓜的费用...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Perhaps you'd save the King the expense of hanging this learned fool...{\r}

561
01:04:00,890 --> 01:04:02,892
{\fs14}让他与瓦洛船长作伴吧{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}and let him keep Captain Vallo company.{\r}

562
01:04:04,185 --> 01:04:06,312
{\fs14}你做了一个慷慨的选择{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Thou hast a generous choice.{\r}

563
01:04:06,604 --> 01:04:08,522
{\fs14}绞架或大海{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}The gallows or the sea.{\r}

564
01:04:16,906 --> 01:04:18,741
{\fs14}你不会嫌拥挤吧{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}If it won't crowd you.{\r}

565
01:04:20,743 --> 01:04:24,372
{\fs14}我宁愿你不来，但我不想显得不友好{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I'd rather you weren't coming, but I don't want to seem inhospitable.{\r}

566
01:04:26,124 --> 01:04:27,583
{\fs14}至于你...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}As for thee...{\r}

567
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:32,755
{\fs14}既然你没有发出声音加重你的船长的罪行...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}since I have no voice to raise against thy Captain's misdemeanors...{\r}

568
01:04:32,839 --> 01:04:36,593
{\fs14}那么，把你的手交给你的新船长，你将得到宽恕{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}thee will be pardoned by giving thy hand to thy new skipper.{\r}

569
01:04:36,884 --> 01:04:40,179
{\fs14}你说什么？要我们解开你的捆绑？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}What say thee? Shall we loose thy bonds?{\r}

570
01:04:51,858 --> 01:04:53,360
{\fs14}把他放开{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Cut him loose.{\r}

571
01:05:29,104 --> 01:05:31,982
{\fs14}完毕，船长，我们让他们漂流{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}It's done, Skipper. We set them adrift.{\r}

572
01:05:32,483 --> 01:05:35,319
{\fs14}早潮会把他们带到海上{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}The morning tide will take them out to sea.{\r}

573
01:05:45,454 --> 01:05:48,707
{\fs14}等等！这要庆祝啊，是不是，贝洛斯先生？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Wait! This calls for a celebration, eh, Mr. Bellows?{\r}

574
01:05:49,124 --> 01:05:53,128
{\fs14}我船上有一桶朗姆酒，直接从总督私地窖中拿来的{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I've a keg of rum aboard my boat. Straight from the Governor's own cellar.{\r}

575
01:05:53,212 --> 01:05:54,463
{\fs14}怎么说？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}What say?{\r}

576
01:05:56,048 --> 01:05:57,132
{\fs14}好{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Aye.{\r}

577
01:05:57,508 --> 01:05:59,009
{\fs14}我要喝一杯{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I could use a drink.{\r}

578
01:05:59,426 --> 01:06:01,846
{\fs14}来吧，小伙子们！把朗姆酒送上船{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Come on, lads! Get the rum aboard.{\r}

579
01:06:05,349 --> 01:06:07,768
{\fs14}把我的带到船长舱{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Bring mine to the Captain's cabin.{\r}

580
01:06:13,816 --> 01:06:16,819
{\fs14}陆地的尽头，我们的世界末日{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}There's the end of land. The end of our world.{\r}

581
01:06:16,944 --> 01:06:19,697
{\fs14}从现在开始，饥饿，干渴，最后翻船{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}From now on, it's starve, thirst, and finally capsize.{\r}

582
01:06:20,281 --> 01:06:22,700
{\fs14}我一直在思考这个问题{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I've been meditating on just that.{\r}

583
01:06:23,117 --> 01:06:27,288
{\fs14}翻船是我们问题的解决办法，毫无疑问{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Capsizing is the solution of our problem. There's no doubt about it.{\r}

584
01:06:28,456 --> 01:06:31,125
{\fs14}- 请跟我来   - 坐下，你这个傻瓜！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- If you'll follow me, please.
- Sit down, you fool!{\r}

585
01:06:34,504 --> 01:06:35,964
{\fs14}坐下，你...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Sit down, you...{\r}

586
01:07:07,662 --> 01:07:08,914
{\fs14}起作用了{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}It works.{\r}

587
01:07:10,624 --> 01:07:12,375
{\fs14}老亚里士多德真棒{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Good old Aristotle.{\r}

588
01:07:12,417 --> 01:07:14,795
{\fs14}2000年以前，他写道：{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Over 2,000 years ago, he wrote:{\r}

589
01:07:14,878 --> 01:07:18,757
{\fs14}“金属容器在没有充气的情况下能保持水下的空气”{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}"A metallic vessel will retain air underwater without filling. "{\r}

590
01:07:18,799 --> 01:07:21,510
{\fs14}但我自己也对这个问题做了一些研究...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}But I myself have done some research on the subject...{\r}

591
01:07:21,593 --> 01:07:25,013
{\fs14}在我设计一艘我称之为海底船的船时{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}while designing a craft which I call an undersea boat.{\r}

592
01:07:25,097 --> 01:07:28,934
{\fs14}- 你怎么知道这船是密封的？  - 在科学方面，孩子...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- How did you know this was airtight?
- In science, my son...{\r}

593
01:07:29,476 --> 01:07:32,229
{\fs14}只有实验才能出真知{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}one knows nothing until one experiments.{\r}

594
01:07:33,438 --> 01:07:36,275
{\fs14}我们现在可以得出结论，我们在呼吸{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}We may now conclude that we are breathing.{\r}

595
01:07:36,441 --> 01:07:38,944
{\fs14}让我们尽快步行上岸{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Let us walk ashore as quickly as possible.{\r}

596
01:07:38,986 --> 01:07:42,489
{\fs14}我估计有足够的空气维持我们几分钟{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I compute there's sufficient air to last us several minutes.{\r}

597
01:07:42,573 --> 01:07:45,451
{\fs14}当然，前提是我们不浪费氧气{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Providing we don't waste our oxygen talking, of course.{\r}

598
01:07:45,534 --> 01:07:48,078
{\fs14}- 那好吧，闭嘴！  - 很好{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- All right, then. Shut up!
- Quite so.{\r}

599
01:09:55,749 --> 01:09:59,837
{\fs14}我亲自出马，你用不着把全部驻军都带来{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}You needn't have brought out the whole garrison. I did the job myself.{\r}

600
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:02,631
{\fs14}当他们醒来的时候，就不会那么顽皮了{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}They won't be so playful when they wake up this time.{\r}

601
01:10:02,715 --> 01:10:04,675
{\fs14}好了，把他们弄醒{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}All right. Wake them up.{\r}

602
01:10:04,925 --> 01:10:07,136
{\fs14}让他们清醒，然后把他们带上那艘海盗船{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Sober them up and take them to the pirate ship.{\r}

603
01:10:07,219 --> 01:10:08,971
{\fs14}丢在他们旁边！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Over the side with them!{\r}

604
01:10:37,792 --> 01:10:40,795
{\fs14}对不起，伙计们，我谦卑地道歉{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Sorry I be for this, mates. And I humbly apologize.{\r}

605
01:10:40,837 --> 01:10:43,631
{\fs14}瓦洛当船长的时候，这两件事根本不可能发生{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}'Twould never have happened with Vallo as skipper.{\r}

606
01:10:43,965 --> 01:10:46,926
{\fs14}他违反了海盗守则，不得不走{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}He violated a pirate code and he had to go.{\r}

607
01:10:47,343 --> 01:10:50,638
{\fs14}但他走得像个海盗，我们走得像死鱼{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}But he went like a pirate. We're going like fish.{\r}

608
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:53,349
{\fs14}我不能原谅我自己{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I can't forgive myself for that.{\r}

609
01:10:54,642 --> 01:10:57,937
{\fs14}国王的奴才把谦卑的贝洛斯当猴耍{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}King's flunky made a monkey of Humble Bellows.{\r}

610
01:10:58,313 --> 01:11:01,149
{\fs14}- 老派海盗   - 够了{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- Pirate of the old school.
- Enough of that!{\r}

611
01:11:01,191 --> 01:11:02,567
{\fs14}把他们提起来！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Hoist them!{\r}

612
01:11:08,615 --> 01:11:11,284
{\fs14}让一名船员登上这艘船，让她重新航行{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Put a crew aboard this ship and have her re-canvased.{\r}

613
01:11:11,326 --> 01:11:13,954
{\fs14}我希望她在我离开的时候准备启航{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I want her ready to sail when I leave.{\r}

614
01:11:14,246 --> 01:11:17,791
{\fs14}给他们足够的面包和水来维持他们的生命{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Give them just enough bread and water to keep them alive.{\r}

615
01:11:17,874 --> 01:11:20,710
{\fs14}他们将从国王那里得到一大笔赏金{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}They'll fetch a good bounty from the King.{\r}

616
01:11:55,788 --> 01:11:57,539
{\fs14}你好，帕布罗·墨菲{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Ahoy. Pablo Murphy.{\r}

617
01:11:59,166 --> 01:12:01,543
{\fs14}- 嗯，我...   - 把我们的锁链弄开{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- Well, I'll be...
- Get us out of these chains.{\r}

618
01:12:01,627 --> 01:12:04,838
{\fs14}在你把我们牵扯进来之后，你还要撒谎？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}After all you got us into, you lying blabbermouth?{\r}

619
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:06,799
{\fs14}你自己解开吧{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Get yourself out of it.{\r}

620
01:12:19,603 --> 01:12:22,815
{\fs14}- 帕布罗·墨菲   - 说最后一次，离我们远点{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- Pablo Murphy.
- For the last time, get away from us.{\r}

621
01:12:23,316 --> 01:12:25,901
{\fs14}用你的脑子想想，我没有出卖埃尔·利布勒{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Get it through that head of yours, I didn't sell El Libre.{\r}

622
01:12:25,985 --> 01:12:28,863
{\fs14}- 让我保证...   - 我们可亲眼看到他做了什么{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- Let me assure...
- We can see for ourselves what he's done.{\r}

623
01:12:28,905 --> 01:12:31,657
{\fs14}如果我们用我的办法，埃尔·利布勒就不会死{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}If we'd gone my way, El Libre wouldn't be dead.{\r}

624
01:12:31,741 --> 01:12:33,993
{\fs14}康苏埃洛也不会被囚禁在宫里...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Consuelo wouldn't be held captive in the palace...{\r}

625
01:12:34,076 --> 01:12:37,038
{\fs14}而我们会有武器阻止格鲁达的人打压我们{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}and we'd have guns to stop Gruda's men from crushing us.{\r}

626
01:12:37,079 --> 01:12:39,290
{\fs14}等等，先生们，士兵{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Hold it, gentlemen. Soldiers.{\r}

627
01:12:48,424 --> 01:12:52,762
{\fs14}根据格鲁达男爵的命令，所有捕鱼作业都将在武装护卫下进行{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}By order of Baron Gruda, all fishing will be done under armed escort.{\r}

628
01:12:53,012 --> 01:12:55,431
{\fs14}全部捕获物都要交给总督{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}The entire catch to be turned over to the Governor.{\r}

629
01:12:55,473 --> 01:12:57,725
{\fs14}- 我们还剩下什么？  - 诱饵{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- What'll be left for us?
- The bait.{\r}

630
01:12:58,059 --> 01:12:59,936
{\fs14}那样的话，我们就不捕鱼了{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}In that case, we'll do no fishing.{\r}

631
01:13:02,105 --> 01:13:03,857
{\fs14}还有反对意见吗？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Any more objections?{\r}

632
01:13:05,066 --> 01:13:08,194
{\fs14}剩下的人去总督码头，快走！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}The rest of you proceed to the Governor's dock. Get moving!{\r}

633
01:13:09,612 --> 01:13:11,614
{\fs14}把他带去城堡{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Take him to the fortress.{\r}

634
01:13:26,463 --> 01:13:27,756
{\fs14}这边{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}This way.{\r}

635
01:14:10,382 --> 01:14:13,469
{\fs14}- 嘿，这里，排队   - 跟着那些船{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- Hey, there, back in line.
- Follow those boats.{\r}

636
01:14:48,129 --> 01:14:49,505
{\fs14}抓住他们！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}After them!{\r}

637
01:16:11,297 --> 01:16:12,548
{\fs14}我们走{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Let's go.{\r}

638
01:16:44,997 --> 01:16:48,292
{\fs14}- 一切都安排好了吗？  - 正如您所吩咐的，阁下{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- Is everything arranged?
- Just as you ordered, Excellency.{\r}

639
01:16:48,334 --> 01:16:51,838
{\fs14}你一夜之间就平定了叛乱，国王定有重赏{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}You've broken the back of the rebellion overnight. The King owes you much.{\r}

640
01:16:51,921 --> 01:16:56,050
{\fs14}他会奖赏的，我甚至可以得到瓦洛船长的全部赏金...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}He will pay it. I may even be able to collect the full bounty on Captain Vallo...{\r}

641
01:16:56,134 --> 01:17:00,013
{\fs14}因为他是在救埃尔·利布勒的时候被自己人杀死{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}for he was killed by his own men while trying to save El Libre.{\r}

642
01:17:04,183 --> 01:17:06,144
{\fs14}别难过，亲爱的{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Don't be upset, my dear.{\r}

643
01:17:06,519 --> 01:17:10,190
{\fs14}你将在这里获得新欢，你要嫁给总督{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}You'll form new attachments here. You're to marry the Governor.{\r}

644
01:17:10,273 --> 01:17:13,026
{\fs14}我走后，你要利用她实行统治，总督{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}After I'm gone, you'll rule through her, Governor.{\r}

645
01:17:13,109 --> 01:17:16,279
{\fs14}你要命令你的人耕种土地，下海捕鱼...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}You'll order your people to till their fields and fish their seas...{\r}

646
01:17:16,362 --> 01:17:18,156
{\fs14}为了国王的荣耀{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}for the greater glory of the King.{\r}

647
01:17:18,198 --> 01:17:20,950
{\fs14}- 我会先死    - 不，你会死到最后{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- I'd die first.
- No, you'll die last.{\r}

648
01:17:21,326 --> 01:17:24,329
{\fs14}首先你会看着你的人一个接一个地离开{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}First you'll watch your people go one by one.{\r}

649
01:17:42,889 --> 01:17:44,725
{\fs14}总有一天我会杀了你{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Someday I'll kill you.{\r}

650
01:17:46,351 --> 01:17:47,561
{\fs14}军官！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Officer!{\r}

651
01:17:53,817 --> 01:17:55,861
{\fs14}这些方法很快就会使她恢复正常{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}These methods will bring her round soon.{\r}

652
01:17:55,944 --> 01:17:58,739
{\fs14}我不希望她在结婚前自杀{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I shouldn't like her to kill herself before she marries.{\r}

653
01:17:58,780 --> 01:18:02,826
{\fs14}她不是那种人，她会嫁给你，等待机会毒死你{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}She's not the type. She'll marry you and wait for a chance to poison you.{\r}

654
01:18:02,910 --> 01:18:06,372
{\fs14}听起来不像是理想的婚姻，我们不能省掉这事吗？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}It doesn't sound like an ideal marriage. Couldn't we dispense with that?{\r}

655
01:18:06,413 --> 01:18:08,749
{\fs14}太多了会刺激我的肝脏{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Too much of it upsets my liver.{\r}

656
01:18:10,709 --> 01:18:14,546
{\fs14}不是你的肝脏，是你的心太软了{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}It's not your liver. It's your heart. It's much too soft.{\r}

657
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:20,261
{\fs14}今晚人们埋葬埃尔·利布勒{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Tonight the people bury El Libre.{\r}

658
01:18:20,511 --> 01:18:23,848
{\fs14}我要在送葬队伍途经的路上张贴一个公告...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I want a proclamation posted in the path of the funeral procession...{\r}

659
01:18:23,931 --> 01:18:26,475
{\fs14}宣布你和埃尔·利布勒的女儿结婚{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}announcing your marriage to the daughter of El Libre.{\r}

660
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:27,893
{\fs14}阁下！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Excellency!{\r}

661
01:18:28,602 --> 01:18:32,273
{\fs14}要求人们参加并提供娱乐节目...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}People will be required to attend and provide entertainment...{\r}

662
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:34,233
{\fs14}使之成为欢乐的一天{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}to make it a day of rejoicing.{\r}

663
01:18:34,275 --> 01:18:36,610
{\fs14}我们要让他们填满皇家粮仓...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}We'll have them fill the royal grain warehouse...{\r}

664
01:18:36,652 --> 01:18:38,988
{\fs14}用一万袋粮食作为礼物{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}with 10,000 sacks of grain as a present.{\r}

665
01:18:39,488 --> 01:18:41,282
{\fs14}你学得很快{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}You're learning fast.{\r}

666
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:45,953
{\fs14}仪式结束后，我会把我的军队和祝福留给你，然后离开{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}After the ceremony, I'll leave you my troops and my blessings, and depart.{\r}

667
01:18:47,788 --> 01:18:52,293
{\fs14}最近倒是有些怀念瓦洛了，这些事真无聊{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Except for the late, lamented Vallo, this has been a most boring assignment.{\r}

668
01:19:03,054 --> 01:19:06,724
{\fs14}上路吧，猪！已宣布对所有囚犯实行大赦{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}On your way, pig! Amnesty has been declared for all prisoners.{\r}

669
01:19:06,808 --> 01:19:10,353
{\fs14}格鲁达男爵将给你一个在婚礼上表示效忠的机会{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Baron Gruda will give you a chance to show allegiance at the wedding.{\r}

670
01:19:11,479 --> 01:19:12,689
{\fs14}格鲁达{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Gruda.{\r}

671
01:19:14,399 --> 01:19:16,943
{\fs14}格鲁达，总有一天我要杀了你{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Gruda, someday I'll kill you.{\r}

672
01:19:17,986 --> 01:19:19,446
{\fs14}我要杀了你！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I'll kill you!{\r}

673
01:19:21,656 --> 01:19:25,201
{\fs14}- 所以现在要举行婚礼，是吗？  - 康苏埃洛永远不会这么做{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- So it's a marriage now, is it?
- Consuelo will never do it.{\r}

674
01:19:25,285 --> 01:19:28,121
{\fs14}看！要给总督一万袋粮食{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Look! 10,000 sacks of grain for the Governor.{\r}

675
01:19:28,163 --> 01:19:29,456
{\fs14}我才不给！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Not mine!{\r}

676
01:19:29,831 --> 01:19:31,791
{\fs14}所以我们要高兴，是吗？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}So we're to rejoice, are we?{\r}

677
01:19:45,722 --> 01:19:48,809
{\fs14}格鲁达男爵下令，对毁坏公物的罪行...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Baron Gruda has made the defacing of public property...{\r}

678
01:19:48,892 --> 01:19:51,186
{\fs14}判处死刑...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}an offense punishable by death...{\r}

679
01:19:51,228 --> 01:19:54,064
{\fs14}无论是对主犯还是同谋{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}both for the culprit and the accomplices.{\r}

680
01:19:54,398 --> 01:19:56,733
{\fs14}中士，围捕这些人{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Sergeant, round up these people.{\r}

681
01:20:26,222 --> 01:20:29,517
{\fs14}- 你打算怎么办？  - 与我无关{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- What are you going to do about it?
- It's no concern of mine.{\r}

682
01:20:38,067 --> 01:20:41,362
{\fs14}- 你打算为她做些什么？   - 无论如何，把她救出来{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- What are you going to do about her?
- Get her out of it, somehow.{\r}

683
01:20:41,779 --> 01:20:44,198
{\fs14}一个人单挑1000名士兵？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Alone, against 1,000 troops?{\r}

684
01:20:44,740 --> 01:20:46,951
{\fs14}- 一定有办法的      - 办法是有{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- There must be a way.
- There is.{\r}

685
01:20:47,034 --> 01:20:50,121
{\fs14}这是一个简单的逻辑问题，我们需要盟友{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}It's a question of simple logic. We need allies.{\r}

686
01:20:50,538 --> 01:20:53,166
{\fs14}人民需要自由，让我们帮他们得到自由{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}These people need freedom. Let's help them get it.{\r}

687
01:20:53,249 --> 01:20:55,751
{\fs14}我唯一感兴趣的是康苏埃洛的自由{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}The only freedom I'm interested in is Consuelo's.{\r}

688
01:20:55,835 --> 01:20:59,047
{\fs14}除非她的人民自由，否则她决不会答应独自逃生{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}She'll never consent to be free until her people are free.{\r}

689
01:20:59,088 --> 01:21:00,465
{\fs14}不可能{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Impossible.{\r}

690
01:21:01,090 --> 01:21:03,718
{\fs14}他们没有机会战胜格鲁达的精锐部队{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}They don't have a chance against Gruda's crack troops.{\r}

691
01:21:03,801 --> 01:21:06,888
{\fs14}科学证明，没有什么是不可能的{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Science has learned that nothing is impossible.{\r}

692
01:21:06,929 --> 01:21:10,850
{\fs14}不久前，我看见一艘船在法国的天空中航行...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Not long ago, I saw a ship sailing through the skies of France...{\r}

693
01:21:10,934 --> 01:21:15,063
{\fs14}用一个装满比空气轻的气体的大袋子支撑{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}supported by a great bag filled with air that was lighter than air.{\r}

694
01:21:15,730 --> 01:21:19,943
{\fs14}我的一个朋友发明了一种能炸山的液体{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}A friend of mine has invented a liquid that can blast away mountains.{\r}

695
01:21:20,401 --> 01:21:24,614
{\fs14}我制造了一艘能在水下航行的船{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I have completed plans for a boat that can sail underneath the water.{\r}

696
01:21:25,281 --> 01:21:27,033
{\fs14}谁能肯定我们不能...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Who knows what we may accomplish...{\r}

697
01:21:27,117 --> 01:21:30,245
{\fs14}战胜落后的格鲁达男爵和他落后的世界？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}against the outdated Baron Gruda and his outdated world?{\r}

698
01:21:30,328 --> 01:21:32,622
{\fs14}我们所需要的就是人民的帮助…{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}All we need is the help of these people...{\r}

699
01:21:32,706 --> 01:21:37,586
{\fs14}些许想象力，加上灵巧的手指，去偷一些基本的材料{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}a little imagination, and deft fingers with which to steal a few basic materials.{\r}

700
01:22:03,737 --> 01:22:05,489
{\fs14}男爵认为我们已经完蛋了{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}The Baron thinks we're finished.{\r}

701
01:22:05,572 --> 01:22:08,117
{\fs14}我们要让他继续这样认为{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}We're going to let him go on thinking so.{\r}

702
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:10,953
{\fs14}我们会按命令填满皇家粮仓{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}We'll fill the royal grain warehouse as ordered.{\r}

703
01:22:10,994 --> 01:22:13,330
{\fs14}但是用包含了教授才能的种子{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}But with the seeds of the Professor's genius.{\r}

704
01:22:13,372 --> 01:22:16,667
{\fs14}- 请再说一遍？  - 男爵拥有最多的武器{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- I beg your pardon?
- The Baron has the most weapons.{\r}

705
01:22:16,750 --> 01:22:18,252
{\fs14}但我们将拥有最新的武器{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}But we'll have the newest.{\r}

706
01:22:18,335 --> 01:22:21,505
{\fs14}开山裂地的炸药，空中飞行的船只{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}An explosive that moves mountains. A ship that flies through the air.{\r}

707
01:22:21,588 --> 01:22:25,384
{\fs14}下个星期天就有空中飞行的船？不可能{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}A ship that flies through the air by next Sunday? Impossible.{\r}

708
01:22:25,926 --> 01:22:27,761
{\fs14}一位伟人曾经告诉我：{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}A great man once said to me:{\r}

709
01:22:27,845 --> 01:22:30,347
{\fs14}“科学证明，没有什么是不可能的”{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}"Science has learned that nothing is impossible. "{\r}

710
01:22:33,726 --> 01:22:35,978
{\fs14}小伙子们，小娘儿们，集合{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Gather round, lads and lasses.{\r}

711
01:22:36,437 --> 01:22:40,858
{\fs14}我们将向你们这些战士和工人展示赶走宿敌的新方法{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}We'll show your fighters and workers new ways to get rid of old enemies.{\r}

712
01:23:34,412 --> 01:23:36,331
{\fs14}闻起来不对劲{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}It doesn't smell right.{\r}

713
01:23:37,916 --> 01:23:40,669
{\fs14}一万袋粮食已运到仓库里去了{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}10,000 sacks of grain have been brought into the warehouse.{\r}

714
01:23:40,752 --> 01:23:42,837
{\fs14}把它们偷运出去的地道也已经完工{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}The tunnel to smuggle them out is complete.{\r}

715
01:23:42,921 --> 01:23:46,258
{\fs14}这个岛正在偷偷发展现代武器...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}The island is making headway with the modern weapons to smuggle in...{\r}

716
01:23:46,341 --> 01:23:48,593
{\fs14}而你仍然站在那里搅动...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}and still you stand and stir...{\r}

717
01:23:48,677 --> 01:23:50,637
{\fs14}没有结果的炖菜{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}that stew with no result.{\r}

718
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:53,515
{\fs14}我的朋友没有把公式给我...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}My friend sent me no formula to go on...{\r}

719
01:23:53,598 --> 01:23:57,185
{\fs14}成分简单，主要是氮和甘油{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}simply the ingredients. Principally nitrogen and glycerin.{\r}

720
01:23:57,269 --> 01:23:59,771
{\fs14}不管怎样，我不确定我是否真的想去发现它{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Anyway, I'm not really sure I want to discover it.{\r}

721
01:23:59,855 --> 01:24:03,609
{\fs14}如果它能炸掉一座山，我怎么知道它不会炸掉一座岛？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}If it can remove a mountain, how do I know it won't remove an island?{\r}

722
01:24:03,650 --> 01:24:06,737
{\fs14}“在科学中，只有实验才能出真知”{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}"In science, one knows nothing unless one experiments. "{\r}

723
01:24:06,820 --> 01:24:09,031
{\fs14}我希望你不要再引用我的话了{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I wish you'd stop quoting me.{\r}

724
01:24:15,954 --> 01:24:17,790
{\fs14}就这样{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}That's it.{\r}

725
01:24:25,631 --> 01:24:26,924
{\fs14}士兵！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Soldiers!{\r}

726
01:24:30,135 --> 01:24:32,137
{\fs14}千万别倒出来{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Don't fall down with that.{\r}

727
01:24:32,388 --> 01:24:34,306
{\fs14}即使他们开枪打死你{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Even if they shoot you.{\r}

728
01:25:04,462 --> 01:25:07,340
{\fs14}早上注意别把这个充气过度了{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Be careful you don't over-inflate this in the morning.{\r}

729
01:25:07,673 --> 01:25:10,176
{\fs14}我们已经把墙的支架剪到了断裂点{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}We've cut the wall braces to the breaking point.{\r}

730
01:25:10,259 --> 01:25:13,513
{\fs14}但愿它们不会在信号发出之前倒塌{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}But we don't want them to collapse before the signal.{\r}

731
01:25:13,554 --> 01:25:14,681
{\fs14}记住...{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Remember...{\r}

732
01:25:14,764 --> 01:25:18,726
{\fs14}除非康苏埃洛安全离开格鲁达男爵，否则不会有信号{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}there'll be no signal given till Consuelo's gotten safely away from Baron Gruda.{\r}

733
01:25:25,441 --> 01:25:26,651
{\fs14}小心{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Careful.{\r}

734
01:25:33,533 --> 01:25:35,326
{\fs14}液体炸药{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}The liquid explosive.{\r}

735
01:25:36,953 --> 01:25:40,665
{\fs14}- 就剩下这些了？  - 我在公式上作了一点改进{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- Is that all that's left?
- I've improved a bit on the formula.{\r}

736
01:25:40,707 --> 01:25:43,209
{\fs14}浓缩1000倍{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}This is concentrated 1,000 times.{\r}

737
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:54,971
{\fs14}拜托{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Please.{\r}

738
01:26:35,471 --> 01:26:39,099
{\fs14}据报，皇家粮仓已满，阁下{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}The royal grain warehouse is reported full to capacity, Your Excellency.{\r}

739
01:26:39,183 --> 01:26:42,102
{\fs14}你居然让他们屈服了{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Amazing how you brought them to their knees.{\r}

740
01:26:42,144 --> 01:26:46,482
{\fs14}不打不成器，别忘了这点，亲爱的总督{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Spare the rod and spoil the child. Never forget that, my dear Governor.{\r}

741
01:26:47,149 --> 01:26:49,318
{\fs14}让我们继续举行婚礼{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Let's get on with the wedding ceremony.{\r}

742
01:26:52,029 --> 01:26:56,742
{\fs14}首先，岛上未婚女子为新娘献上鲜花{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}First, a floral offering for the bride from the unmarried girls of the island.{\r}

743
01:26:56,784 --> 01:26:59,328
{\fs14}本地庆祝婚礼的习俗{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}A local custom for celebrating weddings.{\r}

744
01:26:59,412 --> 01:27:01,205
{\fs14}- 继续   - 音乐{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- Proceed.
- Music.{\r}

745
01:27:37,492 --> 01:27:39,828
{\fs14}当心，你的胡子露出来了{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Watch it. Your beard is showing.{\r}

746
01:27:40,453 --> 01:27:41,830
{\fs14}我们走{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Here we go.{\r}

747
01:27:47,252 --> 01:27:49,921
{\fs14}这些农民的样貌不合我的口味{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}These peasant shapes are not to my taste.{\r}

748
01:28:02,059 --> 01:28:03,435
{\fs14}格鲁达去死吧！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Death to Gruda!{\r}

749
01:28:15,239 --> 01:28:16,573
{\fs14}杀了他们！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Kill them!{\r}

750
01:28:47,563 --> 01:28:49,648
{\fs14}左舷排炮，开火！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Port side battery. Fire!{\r}

751
01:28:58,240 --> 01:29:00,493
{\fs14}不，我是说左边，向左！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}No, I mean left. Left!{\r}

752
01:29:00,576 --> 01:29:02,870
{\fs14}不，右边，不，左一点{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}No. Right. No, left a bit.{\r}

753
01:29:04,372 --> 01:29:05,957
{\fs14}你们怎么了？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}What's the matter with you?{\r}

754
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:08,167
{\fs14}你们不知道要往哪边吗？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Don't you know where you're going?{\r}

755
01:29:33,735 --> 01:29:34,819
{\fs14}开火！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Fire!{\r}

756
01:29:45,789 --> 01:29:47,499
{\fs14}我们去追那个女孩{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}We're going after the girl.{\r}

757
01:30:17,946 --> 01:30:19,323
{\fs14}让我们脱掉这身衣服干吧{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Let's strip for action.{\r}

758
01:30:27,414 --> 01:30:28,499
{\fs14}立定！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Halt!{\r}

759
01:30:31,502 --> 01:30:34,338
{\fs14}我们要把他们切成碎片，去操好你们的大炮{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}We'll cut her to pieces. Man your cannons.{\r}

760
01:30:35,756 --> 01:30:36,966
{\fs14}快点，现在{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Come on, now.{\r}

761
01:30:45,266 --> 01:30:47,309
{\fs14}炸药，快{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}The high explosive. Quick.{\r}

762
01:31:24,806 --> 01:31:27,225
{\fs14}- 快走！  -是，是，先生{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- Get underway!
- Aye, aye, sir.{\r}

763
01:31:29,727 --> 01:31:31,312
{\fs14}操动绞盘！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Man the capstan!{\r}

764
01:31:36,234 --> 01:31:37,735
{\fs14}把她带到下面{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Get her below.{\r}

765
01:31:39,404 --> 01:31:41,614
{\fs14}不要浪费时间，割断缆绳！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Don't waste time. Slit the cable!{\r}

766
01:31:46,202 --> 01:31:49,247
{\fs14}我们得提升高度，卸下压舱物{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}We've got to gain altitude. Unload the ballast.{\r}

767
01:31:57,255 --> 01:31:59,090
{\fs14}快，扔掉一些东西{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Come on. Get rid of something.{\r}

768
01:32:10,102 --> 01:32:12,771
{\fs14}- 这是什么？  - 这是天国的愤怒！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- What is it?
- It is the wrath of heaven!{\r}

769
01:32:12,854 --> 01:32:14,773
{\fs14}它摧毁了城堡！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}It has destroyed the fortress!{\r}

770
01:32:17,109 --> 01:32:19,820
{\fs14}我们的船，我们的小伙子，我们直奔他们{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Our ship and our lads. We're heading straight for them.{\r}

771
01:32:21,238 --> 01:32:22,739
{\fs14}靠近{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Make it close.{\r}

772
01:32:24,950 --> 01:32:26,451
{\fs14}但不要太近{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}But not too close.{\r}

773
01:32:26,493 --> 01:32:29,705
{\fs14}我们要用我们的船和我们的人去抓格鲁达{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}We'll need our ship and our lads to catch Gruda.{\r}

774
01:32:35,252 --> 01:32:37,755
{\fs14}他们要炸掉我们！跳船逃命吧！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}They're going to blow us up! Jump for your lives!{\r}

775
01:33:11,831 --> 01:33:14,125
{\fs14}- 我们的船长！   - 我们就知道你会来{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- It's our own skipper!
- We knew you'd come.{\r}

776
01:33:14,166 --> 01:33:16,294
{\fs14}让我们离开这艘船{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Get us off this ship.{\r}

777
01:33:16,335 --> 01:33:19,046
{\fs14}- 把绳子剪断   - 把我们弄出去！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}- Cut the rope down.
- Get us out of here!{\r}

778
01:33:35,688 --> 01:33:38,733
{\fs14}打开所有的帆，你们这些童话中的海蛇！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Pack out all canvas, you fairy-tale sea snakes!{\r}

779
01:33:38,816 --> 01:33:40,193
{\fs14}去抓住他们！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Go get 'em!{\r}

780
01:33:45,532 --> 01:33:46,783
{\fs14}动起来！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Move them!{\r}

781
01:33:47,033 --> 01:33:47,992
{\fs14}快！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Move!{\r}

782
01:34:17,564 --> 01:34:20,692
{\fs14}我真的认为他打算和我们作战{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I really think he plans to do battle with us.{\r}

783
01:34:23,487 --> 01:34:26,281
{\fs14}瓦洛船长失去了理智和勇气{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Captain Vallo's lost his head as well as his heart.{\r}

784
01:34:40,963 --> 01:34:42,256
{\fs14}曳三角帆{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Haul that jib.{\r}

785
01:34:45,301 --> 01:34:47,219
{\fs14}修一下上面的绞架{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Trim those top gallows.{\r}

786
01:34:48,012 --> 01:34:49,555
{\fs14}右舷两点{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Two points starboard.{\r}

787
01:35:02,068 --> 01:35:04,153
{\fs14}保持侧舷火力{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Hold your fire for a broadside.{\r}

788
01:35:04,236 --> 01:35:06,364
{\fs14}我们开火吗？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Shall we fire?{\r}

789
01:35:06,447 --> 01:35:10,076
{\fs14}那个女孩在船上，不要开火，我们去登船{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}There'll be no firing with the girl on the ship. We're going to board her.{\r}

790
01:35:19,293 --> 01:35:21,420
{\fs14}你们都下甲板{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Below decks, the lot of you.{\r}

791
01:35:21,546 --> 01:35:23,047
{\fs14}赶快{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}On the double.{\r}

792
01:35:30,930 --> 01:35:32,682
{\fs14}来吧，贝洛斯先生？{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Coming, Mr. Bellows?{\r}

793
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:37,270
{\fs14}这些笨蛋要跟我们交换火力{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}The fools are going to trade broadsides with us.{\r}

794
01:35:44,652 --> 01:35:45,987
{\fs14}你走吧{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}In you go.{\r}

795
01:35:49,741 --> 01:35:52,577
{\fs14}没人掌舵，我们就无法与他们并肩而行{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}With nobody at the wheel to steer, we'll not get alongside.{\r}

796
01:35:52,660 --> 01:35:55,497
{\fs14}已经晚了，我们必须抓住机会{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Too late to worry about it. We'll have to take our chances.{\r}

797
01:35:55,580 --> 01:35:57,624
{\fs14}如你所愿，我们走{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}As ye wish. We'll go.{\r}

798
01:36:04,631 --> 01:36:06,508
{\fs14}我谦卑地道歉{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}My humble apologies.{\r}

799
01:36:06,550 --> 01:36:09,761
{\fs14}如果我不能像海盗一样生，那么我会像海盗一样死{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}But if I can't live like a pirate, I'll die like one.{\r}

800
01:36:09,845 --> 01:36:12,681
{\fs14}我会站在舵盘边把她带到旁边{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}I'll stand by the wheel and bring her alongside.{\r}

801
01:36:12,722 --> 01:36:15,183
{\fs14}船长！把他们弄脏！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Skipper! Do them the dirty!{\r}

802
01:37:06,152 --> 01:37:07,778
{\fs14}准备开火！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Stand by to fire!{\r}

803
01:37:17,914 --> 01:37:18,831
{\fs14}开火{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Fire!{\r}

804
01:41:11,484 --> 01:41:13,486
{\fs14}我们失败了！抓住那个女孩！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}We're lost! Get the girl!{\r}

805
01:43:41,302 --> 01:43:43,638
{\fs14}等一下，教授！我们赢了！{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Hold it, Professor! We've won!{\r}

806
01:43:43,888 --> 01:43:45,765
{\fs14}扔掉那玩意儿{\r}
{\fs12\1c&H00FFFF&\b0\i1}Get rid of that stuff.{\r}

807
01:44:16,888 --> 01:44:23,765
剧终
