1
00:00:15,275 --> 00:00:17,861
全速前进!
Man the yards! Quick on all canvas!

2
00:00:20,782 --> 00:00:22,992
小伙子们，姑娘们，围过来
Gather round, lads and lasses. Gather round.

3
00:00:23,159 --> 00:00:29,416
被绑架上船，准备“深红海盗”号的最后一次巡航…很久很久以前，在遥远的加勒比海。
You've been shanghaied aboard for the last cruise of the Crimson Pirate... a long, long time ago in the far, far Caribbean.

4
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:36,508
记住，在海盗船里，在海盗水域里，在海盗世界里……不要问问题。只相信你所看到的。
Remember, in a pirate ship, in pirate waters, in a pirate world... ask no questions. Believe only what you see.

5
00:00:43,141 --> 00:00:45,936
不。相信你所看到的一半。
No. Believe half of what you see.

6
00:00:47,813 --> 00:00:50,442
操纵绞盘! 起锚!
Man the capstan! Up anchor!

7
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:52,861
快走，你们这些笨蛋!
Move, you lubbers!

8
00:02:20,715 --> 00:02:22,091
右舷有船!
Ship to starboard!

9
00:02:34,731 --> 00:02:35,857
注意!
Attention!

10
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,834
一艘坏血病船，阁下。
A scurvy ship, Your Excellency.

11
00:02:51,543 --> 00:02:55,464
你可以通过四肢的位置来判断。坏血病害死了所有船员。
You can tell by the position of the limbs. Scurvy's killed the whole crew.

12
00:03:00,429 --> 00:03:03,056
漂亮的小船，船长Rodríguez。
A trim little ship, Captain Rodríguez.

13
00:03:03,432 --> 00:03:06,477
我们把她拖走。她会带来一大笔钱。
We'll take her in tow. She'll bring a tidy sum.

14
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:10,815
派一名军官和两名船员上船，天黑前把船拖过来。
Put an officer and two men aboard her, and have her in tow by nightfall.

15
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,151
是,是,先生。
Aye, aye, sir.

16
00:04:11,805 --> 00:04:15,016
只有恶魔才能从死亡之船上来——啊。
- Only evil can come from a death ship. - Aye.

17
00:04:15,725 --> 00:04:17,728
Sanctus，他们中的一个碰了我!
Sanctus, one of them touched me!

18
00:04:18,896 --> 00:04:20,898
他们俩后来怎么样了?
What happened to those two?

19
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:22,900
跟我来。
Follow me.

20
00:04:58,735 --> 00:05:01,154
我诚挚的歉意。
My humble apologies.

21
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,259
无聊?
Bored?

22
00:07:05,301 --> 00:07:08,888
要是有什么东西能打破这次航行的单调就好了。
If only there was something to break the monotony of this voyage.

23
00:07:10,057 --> 00:07:11,850
请的手在空中。
Hands aloft, please.

24
00:07:18,984 --> 00:07:21,821
你们是瓦洛船长和他的卑鄙船员的俘虏。
You're the prisoners of Captain Vallo and his scurvy crew.

25
00:07:39,383 --> 00:07:41,510
你可能太自信了，瓦洛船长。
You may be overconfident, Captain Vallo.

26
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:44,222
这艘船上有两百名海军陆战队员。
Two hundred of the King's marines are aboard this vessel.

27
00:07:44,305 --> 00:07:47,351
只有20个海盗。这让我的胜算稍微大一些。
And only 20 pirates. That puts the odds slightly in my favor.

28
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:50,604
-最好交出船。-我只是个过客。
- Better surrender the ship. - I am merely a passenger.

29
00:07:51,272 --> 00:07:53,149
-他是谁?——Gruda男爵。
- Who is he? - Baron Gruda.

30
00:07:53,233 --> 00:07:55,443
觐见陛下的特使。
Special envoy to His Majesty.

31
00:07:57,154 --> 00:07:59,949
这是我的荣幸。
Well, this is a pleasure.

32
00:08:00,366 --> 00:08:03,745
-你绞死了我的大部分朋友。-因为你杀了我的大部分人。
- You hanged most of my friends. - For murdering most of mine.

33
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:10,587
看来你现在只有199名陆战队员，男爵。
Seems you have only 199 marines now, Baron.

34
00:08:12,255 --> 00:08:15,634
198. 最好说服上尉投降。
198. Better persuade the Captain to surrender.

35
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:20,807
船长不是那种…197.
The Captain is not the type to... 197.

36
00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:23,977
不过，如果你允许我跟他谈谈……
However, if you'll permit me to speak to him...

37
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:29,692
奥乔，给队长传个话。
Ojo, pass the word for the Captain.

38
00:08:36,367 --> 00:08:39,079
打倒船长!
Bring down the Captain!

39
00:08:39,871 --> 00:08:42,082
叫舰长下来!
Send down the Captain!

40
00:08:42,624 --> 00:08:44,627
保存船长!
Save the Captain!

41
00:08:44,711 --> 00:08:46,713
叫舰长下来!
Send down the Captain!

42
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:53,012
你找船长了吗，先生?
Did you ask for the Captain, sir?

43
00:08:53,095 --> 00:08:56,015
看不见你。向他致意，请他进来。
Aye. Pay him my compliments and show him in.

44
00:09:25,717 --> 00:09:27,719
聚集,小伙子。聚集。
Gather round, lads. Gather round.

45
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,435
我们很幸运。
We're in luck.

46
00:09:33,518 --> 00:09:36,396
大家很快就会大开杀身之祸了。
All hands will soon be digging into a fat divvy.

47
00:09:37,773 --> 00:09:41,027
我们即将迎来史上最盛大最精彩的海盗时代。
We're heading for the biggest and the best pirate days ever.

48
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:43,989
这是一个大概的数字。
And here's the rich tally in round numbers.

49
00:09:45,032 --> 00:09:46,700
“火枪:3000。
"Muskets: 3,000.

50
00:09:47,451 --> 00:09:49,454
“粉桶:1500。
"Powder kegs: 1,500.

51
00:09:50,121 --> 00:09:53,124
“步枪发射了65000发。
"Rounds of musket shot: 65,000.

52
00:09:53,875 --> 00:10:00,174
-“炮弹……“——请原谅我打断你……可是你什么时候才能挖到金子呢?
- "Rounds of cannon shot... " - Begging thy pardon for interrupting... but when will thee get into the gold?

53
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:05,305
听着,伙伴,倾听。
Listen, fellows, listen.

54
00:10:05,389 --> 00:10:12,230
这片海域有许多岛屿正冒着反抗国王的浪潮……只是因为没有枪才没发火。
There are islands in these waters steaming with rebellion against the King... and kept from boiling over only for lack of guns.

55
00:10:12,313 --> 00:10:15,067
在这些岛屿上，枪比金子还值钱。
Islands where guns are worth more than gold.

56
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:17,444
-不仅仅是钻石。——军火走私?
- More than diamonds. - Gunrunning?

57
00:10:17,486 --> 00:10:20,699
但那不是海盗，船长。这是生意。
But that's not piracy, Skipper. That's business.

58
00:10:20,782 --> 00:10:24,494
-意思是在岸上工作。-我们的浮力很差。
- That means working ashore. - We're doing poorly enough afloat.

59
00:10:25,037 --> 00:10:28,499
如果我们要尝试这种新手法，那就好好干。
If we're going to try this new caper, let's make it a good one.

60
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:33,505
这批货能从任何有价值的叛军那里带来五万金币弗罗林。
This cargo will bring 50,000 gold florin from any rebels worth the name.

61
00:10:33,547 --> 00:10:37,010
- 50000弗罗林?-拍得不错。
- 50,000 florin? - That's a pretty good take.

62
00:10:37,052 --> 00:10:44,894
让我们投票表决吧。所有赞成……如果你不介意我打断你的话，船长……我想在投票前好好想想。
Let's put it to the vote. All those in favor... If you'll forgive my interrupting, Skipper... I'd like to think before I vote.

63
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:48,564
与此同时，我们还有普通的海盗生意要解决。
Meantime, we got regular pirate business to settle.

64
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:52,403
我们得到了木板，罪犯和判决。
We got the plank, the culprit, and the verdict.

65
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:56,157
我们只需要审判和执行一个判决。
All we need's a trial and execution of a sentence.

66
00:10:56,199 --> 00:10:57,450
他是有罪的!
He's guilty!

67
00:10:57,784 --> 00:11:00,620
审判到此为止。现在执行。
So much for the trial. Now for execution.

68
00:11:01,664 --> 00:11:03,624
来吧。杀了我，你们这些傻瓜。
Come on. Kill me, you fools.

69
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:08,130
国王的海军会搜遍七大洋直到你们每个人都被绞死。
The King's Navy will scour the Seven Seas till every one of you is hung high and dry.

70
00:11:08,213 --> 00:11:11,091
-跟他一起到木板上去!——停住!
- To the plank with him! - Avast!

71
00:11:19,268 --> 00:11:21,228
他不会走木板路的。
There'll be no plank-walking for him.

72
00:11:21,312 --> 00:11:27,736
原谅我的迟钝，船长……但你是在要求我们放过这只可爱的蟾蜍吗?
Forgive my slow-wittedness, Skipper... but are thee asking us to spare this sweet-smelling toad?

73
00:11:28,362 --> 00:11:30,698
请大人原谅。
Begging Thy Excellency's pardon.

74
00:11:30,782 --> 00:11:33,952
你们队长比你们所有人加起来都聪明。
Your captain's got more brains than all of you put together.

75
00:11:34,035 --> 00:11:36,204
你肯定是想拿我来勒索赎金。
No doubt you intend to hold me for ransom.

76
00:11:36,288 --> 00:11:39,792
不，我的羽毛漂亮的朋友。我给你自由。
No, my fine-feathered friend. I'm setting you free.

77
00:11:40,793 --> 00:11:44,464
我说，如果猴子对我们没有好处，我们就享受我们的乐趣。
I say, if there's no profit in the monkey we'll have our pleasure.

78
00:11:44,548 --> 00:11:46,633
我说他是有好处的。活着。
I say there is profit in him. Alive.

79
00:11:46,717 --> 00:11:49,053
-多少利润?-现在听我说完。
- How much profit? - Now hear me out.

80
00:11:51,431 --> 00:11:58,898
我说叛军给我五万弗罗林买枪…而在这里，由特别委员会负责的，就是国王的首席反叛军捕手。
I said 50,000 gold florin from the rebels for the guns... and here, by special commission, is the King's chief rebel-catcher.

81
00:11:59,482 --> 00:12:05,113
所以为什么不从他和他的国王那里再得到5万美元呢?告诉他们我们把枪都卖给了哪个叛军。
So why not another 50,000 from him and his king... for telling them which rebels we sell all the guns to.

82
00:12:05,197 --> 00:12:06,324
呃,男爵?
Eh, Baron?

83
00:12:06,407 --> 00:12:09,160
好主意，上尉。我的祝贺。
A brilliant scheme, Captain. My congratulations.

84
00:12:09,243 --> 00:12:10,995
你的祝贺。
Thy congratulations.

85
00:12:11,788 --> 00:12:15,251
如果你是为了它，它就不是为了海盗的利益。
If thou art for it, it is not for the good of pirates.

86
00:12:15,292 --> 00:12:17,294
好吗?先生们,这是宏伟的。
Good? Gentlemen, it's magnificent.

87
00:12:17,378 --> 00:12:22,092
我要去眼镜蛇岛抓一个叫El Libre的人，粉碎他的叛乱。
I'm bound for the Island of Cobra to catch a man, El Libre, and smash his rebellion.

88
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:29,058
如果你把枪带到那里，把他从洞里引到我手里……我再给你加5万。
If you'll take the guns there, lure him out of his hole and into my hands... I'll raise the purse another 50,000.

89
00:12:29,977 --> 00:12:34,064
这就是，伙计们，大概的数字:15万弗罗林。
There it is, lads, in round figures: 150,000 florin.

90
00:12:37,319 --> 00:12:40,071
现在你觉得怎么样，Humble Bellows先生?
What do you say now, Mr. Humble Bellows?

91
00:12:40,655 --> 00:12:45,828
你卑微的仆人会相信的……当你卑微的仆人看见它。
Thy humble servant will believe it... when thy humble servant sees it.

92
00:12:46,662 --> 00:12:49,041
我想我们达成协议了，上尉。
I take it we have a deal, Captain.

93
00:13:20,995 --> 00:13:23,915
船长，这次换船，真不舒服。
This change of ship, Captain, most uncomfortable.

94
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:27,294
我的人不会转移货物的。太像诚实的工作了。
My men won't transfer cargo. Too much like honest work.

95
00:13:27,377 --> 00:13:30,840
瓦洛船长，你的人只给我留了头帆和上帆。
Captain Vallo, your men have only left me headsail and topsail.

96
00:13:30,924 --> 00:13:33,593
它们足以让你迟早找到眼镜蛇。
They're enough to get you to Cobra sooner or later.

97
00:13:33,676 --> 00:13:35,846
我的船比这艘驳船快。
My ship is faster than this barge.

98
00:13:35,888 --> 00:13:41,686
我不希望你在我把El Libre准备好交付之前进港……或者在我背后开一枪。
I don't want you making port before I've got El Libre ready for delivery... or putting a shot in my backside.

99
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:45,232
我希望El Libre不像你这么小心，上尉。
I hope El Libre is not as careful as you are, Captain.

100
00:13:56,954 --> 00:13:58,957
摆脱舵!
Cast off helm!

101
00:14:00,876 --> 00:14:03,044
摆脱严厉!
Cast off stern!

102
00:14:05,089 --> 00:14:09,218
-贝洛斯先生，开船!-是，是，先生!
- Mr. Bellows, make sail! - Aye, aye, sir!

103
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:36,251
把车拉上来，全速前进。
Haul up, full and by.

104
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:40,256
也没有”和“东方。我们正前往眼镜蛇岛。
Nor' nor' east. We're heading for the Isle of Cobra.

105
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,925
来吧，你们这些笨蛋，快走!
Come on, you lubbers, move!

106
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,139
你们听，你们听!
Hear ye, hear ye!

107
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:29,105
国王的船现在抛锚了……在眼镜蛇港，格鲁达男爵在船上。
The King's vessel is now at anchor... in the port of Cobra with Baron Gruda aboard.

108
00:15:29,188 --> 00:15:33,986
任何示威都将被视为叛国罪。
Any demonstration will be regarded as high treason.

109
00:15:35,863 --> 00:15:37,990
人们看起来很安静，不是吗?
The people seem very quiet, don't they?

110
00:15:38,073 --> 00:15:41,620
我不认为他们打算示威反对格鲁达男爵。
I don't think they intend to demonstrate against Baron Gruda after all.

111
00:15:41,703 --> 00:15:44,372
-显然不是，州长-太遗憾了。
- Apparently not, Governor. - What a pity.

112
00:15:44,456 --> 00:15:47,043
我们的军队可以像砍麦子一样砍倒他们。
Our troops could've cut them down like wheat.

113
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,879
我们就不能照一般原则拍几部吗?
Couldn't we shoot a few on general principles?

114
00:15:49,921 --> 00:15:51,339
也许能打动男爵。
Might impress the Baron.

115
00:15:51,381 --> 00:15:53,759
他可能觉得你只是在找麻烦。
He might feel you are merely provoking trouble.

116
00:15:53,842 --> 00:15:57,096
最令人恼火。向格鲁达男爵敬礼。
Most exasperating. Fire the salute to Baron Gruda.

117
00:15:59,891 --> 00:16:01,226
注意!
Attention!

118
00:16:13,824 --> 00:16:18,038
你一声令下，我就给那些背后捅刀子的人来一枪。
Give the word and I'll dose those backstabbers with a broadside.

119
00:16:18,413 --> 00:16:20,707
他们没朝我们开火，你个脑残猿。
They're not firing at us, you powder-brained ape.

120
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:25,004
他们要给我们放15响礼炮。我们要高举格鲁达的旗帜。
They're giving us a 15-gun salute. We're flying the flag of Gruda.

121
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:28,258
Slimey，把旗子拿出来，把我给你的信息拿出来。
Slimey, bring out the flags and run up that message I gave you.

122
00:16:29,092 --> 00:16:31,720
Slimey，代我向州长问好。
And, Slimey, give the Governor my compliments.

123
00:16:31,803 --> 00:16:33,348
深红色的海盗的吗?
The Crimson Pirate's?

124
00:16:33,431 --> 00:16:35,892
不，你这个牡蛎头，格鲁达男爵。
No, you oyster-head, Baron Gruda's.

125
00:16:36,643 --> 00:16:40,272
贝洛斯先生，把这些半桅杆的猴子留在甲板下面。
Mr. Bellows, keep the rest of these half-masted monkeys below deck.

126
00:16:40,356 --> 00:16:41,649
是,是,队长。
Aye, aye, Skipper.

127
00:16:41,732 --> 00:16:44,777
小伙子们，请密切注意。我今晚会和El Libre一起回来。
Keep a sharp lookout, lads. I'll be back with El Libre tonight.

128
00:16:44,861 --> 00:16:46,363
我们走吧,处。
Let's go, Ojo.

129
00:16:53,621 --> 00:16:57,918
有一个好海盗，像卖鱼的一样卖他的货物。
There goes a good pirate, to sell his wares like a fish peddler.

130
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,921
当然，这不是对船长的不尊重。
Meaning no disrespect to the Skipper, of course.

131
00:17:01,005 --> 00:17:07,095
有人悬赏我们的人头…也像活靶子一样在国王陛下的港口挖了个洞
Us with a price on our heads... holed, too, in one of His Majesty's ports like sitting ducks.

132
00:17:07,846 --> 00:17:12,268
但如果船长能让我们再渡过难关，我们就成了有金蛋的鸭子。
But if the Skipper pulls us through again, we'd be the ducks with the golden eggs.

133
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:15,814
你想的是鹅，请原谅我的纠正，毒药保罗。
You're thinking of geese, if you'll pardon the correction, Poison Paul.

134
00:17:16,273 --> 00:17:19,151
大雁在徒劳地追逐。
Geese on a wild-goose chase.

135
00:17:30,498 --> 00:17:31,999
他们说什么，约瑟夫?
What do they say, Joseph?

136
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:37,506
他们把瘟疫带上船了，他们在隔离自己…直到受害者被杀死或治愈。
They've got the plague onboard, and they're quarantining themselves... until the victims are killed or cured.

137
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:41,720
我们必须向格鲁达男爵表示深切的哀悼。
We must signal my profound condolences to Baron Gruda.

138
00:17:41,803 --> 00:17:44,682
-很好，州长。-也许这样最好，约瑟夫
- Very well, Governor. - Maybe it's all for the best, Joseph.

139
00:17:44,724 --> 00:17:49,979
El Libre的追随者们可能会出手给我一个机会让男爵刮目相看 叫我的马车
El Libre's followers may yet show their hands... and give me a chance to impress the Baron. Order my carriage.

140
00:17:50,314 --> 00:17:54,401
驱散人群。换掉守卫，在街上加倍巡逻。
Disperse the crowd. Change the guard, and double your patrols in the street.

141
00:17:55,694 --> 00:17:57,614
来吧，我的小妹妹。
Come on, my popsy-wopsy-wopsies.

142
00:18:08,543 --> 00:18:12,589
瘟疫,是吗?愿它带走所有的人。男爵Gruda第一。
Plague, is it? May it take all of them. Baron Gruda first.

143
00:18:13,048 --> 00:18:15,677
是啊，就算瘟疫没来，我们也得去。
Aye, and if the plague don't, we will.

144
00:18:18,304 --> 00:18:20,850
-你是谁?-像你们这样单纯的渔民。
- Who are you? - Simple fisher folk like yourselves.

145
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:24,937
请他给我一杯麦芽酒，说句友好的话，再给我个机会跟国王决斗。
Put in for a tankard of ale, a friendly word, and a chance to fight the King.

146
00:18:27,858 --> 00:18:29,318
为什么选择我们?
Why choose us?

147
00:18:34,115 --> 00:18:35,909
你看起来和说话都像个斗士。
You look and talk like a fighter.

148
00:18:36,409 --> 00:18:37,828
同类相知。
It takes one to know one.

149
00:18:37,912 --> 00:18:40,623
你可能已经盯上我们了。也许不是。
You may have us marked, all right. Maybe not.

150
00:18:40,706 --> 00:18:42,666
但我们还没有给你做标记。
But we haven't marked you yet.

151
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,212
-我们不会问任何问题——我们。
- We're asking no questions. - We are.

152
00:18:46,129 --> 00:18:48,715
我对El Libre的了解已经足够了。
What I've heard about El Libre is good enough for me.

153
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,343
告诉我们怎么联系他。
Tell us how to contact him.

154
00:18:50,426 --> 00:18:53,972
像他这样的人，要是船上有两个强壮的小伙子，一定会很高兴的。
A man like him would be pleased to have two more strong-armed lads aboard.

155
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,275
他们不太相信别人，对吧?
Not very trusting souls, are they?

156
00:19:14,997 --> 00:19:18,250
我想我们得证明我们对El Libre的高度尊重。
I guess we'll have to prove our high regard for El Libre.

157
00:19:31,141 --> 00:19:33,769
奥乔，你说出了我想说的话。
Ojo, you took the words right out of my mouth.

158
00:19:33,852 --> 00:19:36,146
和国王的人打架。我们走吧。
A brawl with the King's men. Let's go.

159
00:19:41,653 --> 00:19:45,574
左,右。离开了。马克的时间!
Left, right. Left. Mark time!

160
00:19:48,494 --> 00:19:49,871
右转。
Right turn.

161
00:19:51,832 --> 00:19:52,916
停止!
Halt!

162
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:59,174
齐步走! 前进! 停下! 转弯！
Quick march! Forward! Halt! Turn!

163
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,395
右转!
Right wheel!

164
00:20:15,526 --> 00:20:17,654
前进!
March!

165
00:20:19,949 --> 00:20:21,075
停!
Halt!

166
00:20:23,035 --> 00:20:24,830
举枪致敬!
Present arms!

167
00:20:55,407 --> 00:20:56,909
共和国万岁!
Long live the republic!

168
00:20:56,992 --> 00:20:58,869
叛军!抓住他们!
Rebels! Get them!

169
00:21:14,263 --> 00:21:15,722
El Libre 万岁!
Long live El Libre!

170
00:21:15,764 --> 00:21:17,182
之后他们!
After them!

171
00:21:59,775 --> 00:22:01,026
他们在那!
There they are!

172
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:04,029
别让他们跑了!
Don't let them get away!

173
00:22:31,938 --> 00:22:33,898
男人!来吧!
Men! Come on!

174
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:44,565
来吧!快去那个角落。
Come on! Quick, in that corner.

175
00:23:45,775 --> 00:23:47,277
他们走了!
There they go!

176
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:00,918
快点，到后面去。
Hurry up. In back.

177
00:24:03,629 --> 00:24:04,923
这里!
This way!

178
00:24:09,594 --> 00:24:10,555
去做吧。
Go ahead.

179
00:24:19,023 --> 00:24:20,190
皮尔斯画布上。
Pierce the canvas.

180
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:35,125
火!
Fire!

181
00:24:42,676 --> 00:24:43,802
准备好了吗?火!
Ready? Fire!

182
00:24:54,648 --> 00:24:57,610
把它捡起来!提升起来!来吧。提升起来!火!
Pick it up! Lift it up! Come on. Lift it up! Fire!

183
00:25:01,948 --> 00:25:03,158
把我们带走。
Take us away.

184
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:07,329
他们得到了!
They're getting away!

185
00:25:25,601 --> 00:25:28,146
门闩酒窖!块小巷!
Latch the cellars! Block the alley!

186
00:25:43,956 --> 00:25:45,125
看出来。士兵。
Look out. Soldiers.

187
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:52,508
只是一分钟。
Just a minute.

188
00:26:02,771 --> 00:26:04,105
搜索的地方。
Search the place.

189
00:27:03,551 --> 00:27:06,512
-这臭味能把猪赶跑。-确实如此。
- The stink would drive away a pig. - Which it did.

190
00:27:08,056 --> 00:27:09,766
看那扇门。
Watch that door.

191
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:18,318
你救了我们，孩子，你救了我们。
You've saved us, lad, you've saved us.

192
00:27:18,401 --> 00:27:20,237
我们是自己人。
We're among our own kind.

193
00:27:21,572 --> 00:27:22,823
叛军。
Rebels.

194
00:27:23,115 --> 00:27:25,576
如果你是El Libre我也不会惊讶。
Wouldn't surprise me if you were El Libre himself.

195
00:27:25,827 --> 00:27:29,289
-你看起来像天生的领袖。-我叫巴勃罗·墨菲
- You look like a born leader of men. - The name's Pablo Murphy.

196
00:27:29,372 --> 00:27:33,169
我从我父亲那里学到了很多爱尔兰语，所以我一听就知道什么是巧言。
And I got enough Irish from me father to know blarney when I hear it.

197
00:27:33,294 --> 00:27:38,008
我们早就因为你窥探间谍而割了你的喉咙了……只因为你对那些士兵所做的。
We'd have slit your throats for snooping spies by now... only for what you did to them soldiers.

198
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:40,177
-他们是谁?——谁知道呢?
- Who are they? - Who knows?

199
00:27:40,219 --> 00:27:42,721
这个不能说话，这个不能保持安静。
This one can't talk and this one can't keep quiet.

200
00:27:42,805 --> 00:27:46,226
好吧，我们有话直说。我是瓦洛船长，愿为您效劳。
All right, let's get to the point. I'm Captain Vallo at your service.

201
00:27:46,309 --> 00:27:48,019
这位是奥乔中尉。
And this is Lieutenant Ojo.

202
00:27:51,274 --> 00:27:53,526
法洛?海盗?
Vallo? The pirate?

203
00:27:53,609 --> 00:27:55,194
深红色的海盗?
The Crimson Pirate?

204
00:27:55,236 --> 00:28:00,576
没错，我的好妈妈，我们为El Libre做了笔交易…一船火药和步枪
That's right, sweet mother, with a bargain for El Libre... a shipload of powder shot and musketry.

205
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:03,038
-格鲁达男爵的船。-格鲁达男爵的船?
- Baron Gruda's ship. - Baron Gruda's ship?

206
00:28:03,121 --> 00:28:05,540
看不见你。格鲁达男爵自己的30枪手。
Aye. Baron Gruda's own 30-gunner.

207
00:28:06,082 --> 00:28:09,045
我们轻而易举地就拿下了她，好渔夫。
We took her as easy as you'd take a mackerel, fine fishermen.

208
00:28:09,128 --> 00:28:11,380
更容易。因为我们用的是死诱饵。
Easier. For we used dead bait.

209
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:13,926
你杀了巴伦·格鲁达?
You killed Baron Gruda?

210
00:28:15,177 --> 00:28:18,180
如果我这么做了，你就不需要我卖给你的枪了。
If I did that you wouldn't need the guns I want to sell you.

211
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:20,600
我是海盗，不是杀狗人。
I'm a pirate, not a dog killer.

212
00:28:20,683 --> 00:28:23,186
但我喜欢你们。我喜欢你的风格。
But I like you lads. I like your style.

213
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:25,189
所以，聚集在一起，看看这个:
So gather round and get this:

214
00:28:25,272 --> 00:28:29,193
男爵将乘坐我的船在几天内到达港口。
The Baron will arrive in port aboard my own ship in a matter of days.

215
00:28:29,276 --> 00:28:33,198
不如带我去El Libre这样我们就能把枪卖了?
So how about taking me to El Libre so we can close the deal for the guns?

216
00:28:33,282 --> 00:28:35,158
时间和潮汐，你知道的。
Time and tide, you know.

217
00:28:55,975 --> 00:28:58,061
把臭味洗掉，带到下面去。
Wash the stink off them and take them below.

218
00:28:58,144 --> 00:28:59,520
把这个消息传下去。
Pass the word along.

219
00:29:20,921 --> 00:29:26,219
天黑的时候，我们把他们带到小船上……然后把他们送到船上。跟我来。
When it's dark, we'll take them to the small boat... and row them out to their ship. Come with me.

220
00:29:39,193 --> 00:29:40,903
现在，你知道计划是什么了。
Now, you know what the plan is.

221
00:29:40,986 --> 00:29:45,992
剩下的会和我的弟兄们一起去捕鱼…站在海盗船旁边接受武器。
The rest will join my lads at the fishing boats... and stand by the pirate vessel to receive the guns.

222
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:48,245
如果海盗拒绝交出他们呢?
Suppose the pirates refuse to give them up?

223
00:29:48,329 --> 00:29:51,123
我会用刀指着瓦洛船长的喉咙。
I'll keep my knife at Captain Vallo's throat.

224
00:29:51,207 --> 00:29:56,171
要么他会下令交出枪支…否则他再也不会下命令了。
Either he'll give the order to hand over the guns... or he'll never give another order.

225
00:29:56,213 --> 00:29:59,424
你是在割我们的喉咙，巴勃罗·墨菲，不是他的。
You're cutting our throats, Pablo Murphy, not his.

226
00:30:03,012 --> 00:30:05,598
我喜欢你的勇气，巴勃罗，但不喜欢你的计划。
I like your nerve, Pablo, but not your plan.

227
00:30:05,682 --> 00:30:09,812
要我说，我们得在格鲁达男爵来之前拿到枪，占领宫殿。
I say we've got to get the guns and take the palace before Baron Gruda gets here.

228
00:30:09,895 --> 00:30:13,525
我觉得我们需要的不仅仅是枪。我们需要El Libre来领导我们。
And I say we need more than guns. We need El Libre to lead us.

229
00:30:13,609 --> 00:30:16,403
你们女人不会面对现实。El Libre被捕了。
You women won't face facts. El Libre's been captured.

230
00:30:16,486 --> 00:30:18,406
面对事实的方法就是拯救他。
The way to face facts is to rescue him.

231
00:30:18,448 --> 00:30:21,034
救他?从国王的监狱里?不可能的。
Rescue him? From the King's prison? Impossible.

232
00:30:22,744 --> 00:30:26,874
对于一个带着三十名机枪手和战斗人员的绝望之人来说是不可能的。
Not for a desperate man with a 30-gunner and a fighting crew.

233
00:30:27,416 --> 00:30:29,628
海盗营救El Libre?
A pirate rescue for El Libre?

234
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,298
那就是把他从油锅里捞出来扔进火里。
That'd be taking him from the frying pan and throwing him into the fire.

235
00:30:33,382 --> 00:30:35,843
-我们会用自己的方式处理。——脸!
- We'll handle this our own way. - About face!

236
00:30:35,927 --> 00:30:37,053
在这里。
Get over here.

237
00:31:19,812 --> 00:31:21,605
有一个会议!门,快!
There's a meeting! The door, quick!

238
00:31:38,208 --> 00:31:39,668
出去!另一扇门!
Out! The other door!

239
00:32:00,902 --> 00:32:03,488
如果我放了你，你能帮我吗?
If I release you, can I count on your help?

240
00:32:05,199 --> 00:32:06,826
你的薪水会很高的。
You'll be well paid.

241
00:32:25,097 --> 00:32:26,974
你错判了我们的人。
You misjudged our men.

242
00:32:27,433 --> 00:32:29,269
不要误判我们的女人。
Don't misjudge our women.

243
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:32,397
-这里还有一扇门。——在哪里?
- Another door here. - Where?

244
00:32:32,481 --> 00:32:33,857
跟我来。
Follow me.

245
00:33:18,285 --> 00:33:21,831
-怎么回事?-从市场回来的船长。
- What's all the shooting? - The Skipper coming back from market.

246
00:33:21,915 --> 00:33:24,667
我有预感我们要出海了。
I have a feeling we'll be putting out to sea.

247
00:33:24,751 --> 00:33:28,589
起重机锚。人所有的画布。看起来活泼!
Hoist anchor. Man all canvas. Look lively!

248
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:30,716
男人的码!
Man the yards!

249
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:36,598
准备火!
Prepare to fire!

250
00:33:41,813 --> 00:33:43,106
火!
Fire one!

251
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,493
火两个!
Fire two!

252
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:13,350
给格鲁达男爵的船发信号，让他开舷。我们中的一个可以把她从水里弄出来。
Signal Baron Gruda's ship for a broadside. One of us can knock her out of the water.

253
00:34:34,625 --> 00:34:38,171
海岸炮台要求对他们进行舷侧攻击，贝洛斯先生。
Shore battery's asking for a broadside against them, Mr. Bellows.

254
00:34:38,254 --> 00:34:40,758
你还在等什么，流口水的白痴?
What are you waiting for, drooling idiot?

255
00:34:40,841 --> 00:34:44,303
-给他们开舷炮!-是，是，先生!舷侧有一条船过来了!
- Give 'em a broadside! - Aye, aye, sir! One broadside coming up!

256
00:35:03,243 --> 00:35:05,245
拍摄好,小伙子。的目的。
Good shooting, lads. Well aimed.

257
00:35:05,745 --> 00:35:08,289
船长，这是你在市场上买的吗?
Skipper, be that what thou bought at market?

258
00:35:10,084 --> 00:35:12,378
带这位女士下去，让她舒服点。
Take the lady below and make her comfortable.

259
00:35:16,133 --> 00:35:17,884
谢谢你,队长。
Thank you, Captain.

260
00:35:20,722 --> 00:35:22,807
英勇的瓦洛船长，是吗，小伙子们?
The gallant Captain Vallo, eh, lads?

261
00:35:28,522 --> 00:35:30,733
是El Libre吗?
Be that bit of fluff El Libre?

262
00:35:30,816 --> 00:35:33,028
这是我们找到他的线索。
That's the bit of fluff that's taking us to him.

263
00:35:33,111 --> 00:35:37,240
他被关在圣佩罗岛上，离这里只有一天的航程。
He's being held on the Island of San Perot, only a day's sailing from here.

264
00:35:38,618 --> 00:35:40,745
谁在帮我们抓他，船长?
Who's holding him for us, Skipper?

265
00:35:40,828 --> 00:35:45,417
国王的军队。在军事监狱里。现在，还有什么比这更甜蜜的呢?
The King's troop. In the military prison. Now, what could be sweeter, lads?

266
00:35:45,459 --> 00:35:49,296
我们把他从国王的手下偷走，再卖回给国王的手下。
We'll steal him from the King's men, and sell him back to a king's man.

267
00:35:50,423 --> 00:35:54,261
-但你当真打算……-把我们送进国王的监狱?
- But be thou seriously planning to... - Walk us into a king's prison?

268
00:35:54,302 --> 00:35:57,265
当然不是，卑微的风箱，当然不是。
Why, not at all, Humble Bellows, not at all.

269
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,851
围过来，小伙子们，围过来!
Gather round, lads, gather round!

270
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:51,328
-我的，我的，好漂亮的一把刀。-你想仔细看看吗?
- My, my, what a pretty knife. - Would you like a closer look?

271
00:36:51,537 --> 00:36:54,081
让我们让这个锅看起来像一条线上的船!
Let's keep this pot looking like a ship of the line!

272
00:36:54,707 --> 00:36:56,209
来这里。
Come up here.

273
00:37:01,591 --> 00:37:02,842
开始干吧!
Hop to it!

274
00:37:11,143 --> 00:37:13,480
我是来谈El Libre的。
I came up to talk about El Libre.

275
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:21,739
——继续。我在听。-你有办法救他吗?
- Go ahead. I'm listening. - You have a plan to save him?

276
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:25,494
一个计划和一个价格。仅枪支就需要5万美元。
A plan and a price. Guns alone will cost 50,000.

277
00:37:25,578 --> 00:37:29,456
这对买枪来说可是一大笔钱。El Libre你要价多少?
That's a great deal of money for guns. How much are you asking for El Libre?

278
00:37:30,499 --> 00:37:32,169
哦，是的， El Libre
Oh, yes, El Libre.

279
00:37:32,919 --> 00:37:34,546
我会白白把他扔进去的。
I'll throw him in for nothing.

280
00:37:36,047 --> 00:37:37,550
很好,队长。
Very well, Captain.

281
00:37:37,633 --> 00:37:40,094
我将设法与他安排这笔钱。
I'll see that the money is arranged with him.

282
00:37:40,178 --> 00:37:42,680
你可以相信他会遵守协议的。
You may be sure that he'll honor the agreement.

283
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:45,017
你的计划是什么?
What's your plan?

284
00:37:49,731 --> 00:37:51,983
你昨晚为什么闩上小屋的门?
Why did you bolt your cabin door last night?

285
00:37:52,275 --> 00:37:54,987
如果你知道它是栓的，你一定试过。
If you know it was bolted, you must've tried it.

286
00:37:55,112 --> 00:37:57,615
如果你试过，你就知道为什么它是闩上的。
And if you tried it, you know why it was bolted.

287
00:38:00,661 --> 00:38:02,704
你打算怎么得到El Libre?
How do you propose to get El Libre?

288
00:38:03,288 --> 00:38:05,249
你的门只对他敞开吗?
Is your door open only to him?

289
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:07,752
你是什么意思?
What do you mean?

290
00:38:07,836 --> 00:38:11,464
这么多对一个人的关注不可能完全是政治性的。
So much concern about one man can't be entirely political.

291
00:38:12,007 --> 00:38:13,593
他是你的爱人。
He's your lover.

292
00:38:14,135 --> 00:38:15,177
不。
No.

293
00:38:15,928 --> 00:38:17,471
他是我的父亲。
He's my father.

294
00:38:19,266 --> 00:38:20,559
船长!
Captain!

295
00:38:25,106 --> 00:38:26,566
土地!
Land ho!

296
00:38:42,961 --> 00:38:45,421
站起来，小伙子们。注意!
On your feet, lads. Attention!

297
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:53,764
你们应该是国王的臣民，而不是吟游诗人。
You're supposed to be king's men, not bard slabs.

298
00:38:53,974 --> 00:38:56,143
看起来你就该穿制服。
Look like you belong in those uniforms.

299
00:39:09,033 --> 00:39:14,331
奥霍，通知守军格鲁达男爵已经来逮捕El Libre了。
Ojo, signal to the garrison that Baron Gruda has arrived... to take El Libre into custody.

300
00:39:26,971 --> 00:39:29,975
-那我父亲呢?-我命令你待在下面。
- What about my father? - I ordered you to stay below.

301
00:39:32,394 --> 00:39:34,354
它们在发出什么信号?
What are they signaling?

302
00:39:36,274 --> 00:39:39,777
卫戍指挥官希望设宴款待格鲁达男爵。
The garrison commander wishes to give a dinner in honor of Baron Gruda.

303
00:39:40,736 --> 00:39:42,698
我们该怎么办?
What are we going to do?

304
00:39:43,949 --> 00:39:46,368
当然，我们会接受。
We're going to accept, of course.

305
00:40:24,205 --> 00:40:29,336
格鲁达男爵和他的小宝贝…船上留下的衣服足够骗过国王了
Baron Gruda and his bit of fluff... left enough clothes onboard to fool the King himself.

306
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:34,258
如果有人认出我们…我们会跳脱衣舞，让El Libre吃点苦头。
If anyone recognizes us... we'll be stripping for action and taking El Libre the hard way.

307
00:40:42,101 --> 00:40:45,188
好多人啊，上尉。一群好男人。
A fine body of men, Captain. A fine body of men.

308
00:41:18,769 --> 00:41:22,775
格鲁达男爵阁下和他的政党。
His Excellency Baron Gruda and party.

309
00:41:39,502 --> 00:41:41,338
欢迎,阁下。
Welcome, Your Excellency.

310
00:41:41,421 --> 00:41:44,883
我们大家都很荣幸终于见到您了。
It is a great honor for all of us to meet you at last.

311
00:41:44,925 --> 00:41:47,971
你能接受我们的款待，我们感到非常高兴。
It gives us great pleasure that you accept our hospitality.

312
00:41:48,054 --> 00:41:50,890
恰恰相反，亲爱的上校，是我被录取了。
On the contrary, my dear Colonel, it is I who am accepted.

313
00:41:50,974 --> 00:41:53,894
哦，不，阁下。我是幸运的。
Oh, no, Your Excellency. I am the lucky one.

314
00:41:54,729 --> 00:41:59,192
眼镜蛇总督指示我处决El Libre
I had instructions from the Governor of Cobra to execute El Libre.

315
00:41:59,943 --> 00:42:02,988
当我收到你的信息时，我正准备这么做。
I was on the verge of doing so when I got your message.

316
00:42:03,071 --> 00:42:08,578
州长是个白痴!我可能会取代他……和一个军人。
The Governor is an idiot! I may replace him... with a military man.

317
00:42:09,329 --> 00:42:12,333
-我亲爱的男爵。-亲爱的上校。
- My dear Baron. - My dear Colonel.

318
00:42:17,923 --> 00:42:21,134
我可以把你介绍给我们的客人吗?-当然可以。
- May I introduce you to our guests? - By all means.

319
00:42:32,273 --> 00:42:34,734
——阁下。——阁下。
- Your Excellency. - Your Excellency.

320
00:43:01,766 --> 00:43:05,229
但我在这里收国王的税太难了。
But I have so much trouble collecting the King's taxes here.

321
00:43:05,312 --> 00:43:08,357
告诉我,计数。人们在家里怎么付款?
Tell me, Count. How do the people pay at home?

322
00:43:11,778 --> 00:43:14,531
通过鼻子!他们花了大价钱!
Through the nose! They pay through the nose!

323
00:43:16,242 --> 00:43:18,077
真是太好了!
That's really very good!

324
00:43:22,291 --> 00:43:24,501
这个游戏我们还要玩多久?
How long do we have to play this game?

325
00:43:26,503 --> 00:43:29,090
直到上校决定交出El Libre
Till the Colonel decides to hand over El Libre.

326
00:43:29,174 --> 00:43:30,759
我害怕。
I am frightened.

327
00:43:55,454 --> 00:43:57,666
伯爵一定是你的心头好。
The Count must be a constant delight to you.

328
00:43:57,708 --> 00:44:00,002
他真是太有趣了。
He's really too funny for words.

329
00:44:00,085 --> 00:44:01,294
事实上他是。
Indeed he is.

330
00:44:01,378 --> 00:44:02,714
请告诉我们，伯爵。
Do tell us, Count.

331
00:44:02,797 --> 00:44:06,175
最近女王出门都穿什么?
What does the Queen wear when she goes out these days?

332
00:44:08,387 --> 00:44:11,390
伯爵总说王后把国王累坏了。
The Count always says the Queen wears the King out.

333
00:44:11,765 --> 00:44:13,684
你是最聪明的人!
You are the wittiest man!

334
00:44:16,897 --> 00:44:20,568
女士们先生们，请注意。
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please.

335
00:44:21,861 --> 00:44:31,038
为了纪念格鲁达男爵的来访……圣西奥驻军的军官们为他准备了一份小礼物。
To commemorate the honor Baron Gruda has done us by his visit... the officers of the Saint Theo garrison have arranged a little gift for him.

336
00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:34,876
请大家到这边来好吗?
Will everyone come this way, please?

337
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:55,400
在左边……有热爱民主和人民的El Libre
On the left... you have that great lover of democracy and the people, El Libre.

338
00:44:55,901 --> 00:45:01,199
而在右边，那位杰出的科学家…教授审慎。
And on the right, that distinguished scientist... Professor Prudence.

339
00:45:01,867 --> 00:45:08,708
两个人都像老鼠被夹子夹住了一样……密谋破坏陛下的荣耀。
Both caught like rats in a trap... conspiring against the greater glory of His Majesty.

340
00:45:09,459 --> 00:45:17,802
但是多亏了像格鲁达男爵这样的政治家…这样的人和这样的思想很快就会被摧毁。
But thanks to statesmen like Baron Gruda... such men and such ideas will soon be destroyed.

341
00:45:18,761 --> 00:45:25,018
作为一位杰出的科学家……我可以向你保证，一个想法没有可以被摧毁的物理性质。
As a distinguished scientist... I can assure you an idea has no physical properties which can be destroyed.

342
00:45:25,102 --> 00:45:30,483
作为一个热爱民主和人民的人，我可以向你保证……它们都能挺过你微不足道的努力。
As a lover of democracy and the people, I can assure you... both will survive your puny efforts.

343
00:45:31,777 --> 00:45:35,364
作为一名政治家，我可以向你保证，没有人能预知未来。
As a statesman, I can assure you that no one can foretell the future.

344
00:45:35,448 --> 00:45:42,205
然而，你现在的命运对我来说很清楚…作为我身边这位美丽女士的脸。
However, your fate at present is as clear to me... as the face of this beautiful lady at my side.

345
00:45:42,289 --> 00:45:43,708
万岁!
Bravo!

346
00:45:43,791 --> 00:45:46,502
谢谢您，阁下。
Thank you, Your Excellency.

347
00:45:51,091 --> 00:45:54,094
是的。她很漂亮。
Yes. She is very beautiful.

348
00:45:55,639 --> 00:45:57,474
阁下说得有道理。
His Excellency has a point.

349
00:45:57,557 --> 00:46:01,604
明明我们的命运就掌握在他手里，还跟命运吵架真是愚蠢。
It's foolish to quarrel with fate when ours is so clearly in his hands.

350
00:46:03,189 --> 00:46:07,194
带他们出去，让格鲁达男爵满意。
Take them outside and hold them for Baron Gruda's pleasure.

351
00:46:12,032 --> 00:46:15,537
亲爱的上校，谢谢你今晚的款待。
My dear Colonel, thank you for a most rewarding evening.

352
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:18,623
-现在我们必须走了。-这绝不是结束。
- And now we must go. - It is by no means over.

353
00:46:18,707 --> 00:46:23,588
我安排了一场特别的娱乐活动…为了这个特别的时刻。
I've arranged a very special entertainment... for this very special occasion.

354
00:46:46,198 --> 00:46:48,367
是那个被我们绑架勒索的女人。
It's that dame we held for ransom.

355
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:00,507
弃船。
Abandon ship.

356
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:03,594
-谢谢你，亲爱的上校。——阁下!
- Thank you, my dear Colonel. - Your Excellency!

357
00:47:04,136 --> 00:47:07,724
-可是，我亲爱的男爵!-愉快的夜晚，上校。
- But, my dear Baron! - Wonderful evening, Colonel.

358
00:47:07,807 --> 00:47:08,933
法洛!
Vallo!

359
00:47:15,065 --> 00:47:16,275
但是,阁下。
But, Your Excellency.

360
00:47:16,358 --> 00:47:20,072
意想不到的国际事务。我们外交官也经常遇到这种事。
Unexpected international affairs. Happens to us diplomats all the time.

361
00:47:24,327 --> 00:47:26,788
-把犯人放到我的马车里。-是，是，先生。
- Put the prisoners in my carriage. - Aye, aye, sir.

362
00:47:34,463 --> 00:47:37,592
我真希望国王能听到，大人。
I do hope the King will hear about this, Your Excellency.

363
00:47:37,676 --> 00:47:39,052
别担心，他会的。
Don't worry, he will.

364
00:47:40,554 --> 00:47:43,474
放开我，你们这些污染的虾。
Unclutch me, you polluted shrimp.

365
00:47:46,310 --> 00:47:48,105
阻止他，你们这些傻瓜!
Stop him, you fools!

366
00:47:48,522 --> 00:47:50,691
他是深红海盗!
He's the Crimson Pirate!

367
00:47:50,774 --> 00:47:52,484
深红色的海盗?
The Crimson Pirate?

368
00:48:00,661 --> 00:48:03,414
深红色的海盗!
The Crimson Pirate!

369
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:07,503
把上校带到安全的地方。快,男人。
Take the Colonel to safety. Quick, man.

370
00:48:09,505 --> 00:48:12,801
-带上校去安全的地方!-放开我，你们这些蠢货!
- Take the Colonel to safety! - Let me go, you fools!

371
00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:16,763
别担心,上校。我会处理好一切的!
Don't worry, Colonel. I'll take care of everything!

372
00:48:16,846 --> 00:48:19,934
拉威尔公民，救救伯爵!-救救伯爵!
- Citizen Ravel, save the Count! - Save the Count!

373
00:48:28,986 --> 00:48:31,531
——陛下!陛下!-干得好，上尉。
- Sire! Sire! - Good work, Captain.

374
00:48:31,823 --> 00:48:34,492
阻止他!那是深红海盗!
Stop him! There's the Crimson Pirate!

375
00:48:35,076 --> 00:48:36,329
船长!
Captain!

376
00:48:38,039 --> 00:48:40,291
军官们在造反。摧毁他们!
The officers are mutinying. Crush them!

377
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:43,337
摧毁他们!来吧!
Crush them! Come on!

378
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:46,340
声音的攻击!
Sound the attack!

379
00:48:50,011 --> 00:48:53,181
代管。不要让步。保护妇女和儿童。
Hold the fort. Don't give an inch. Protect the women and children.

380
00:48:53,224 --> 00:48:56,227
援军马上就到。锁的大门!不要让任何人出去。
Reinforcements are on the way. Lock the gates! Let no one out.

381
00:48:56,268 --> 00:48:58,270
锁的大门!不要让任何人出去!
Lock the gates! Let no one out!

382
00:48:58,354 --> 00:49:01,650
国王万岁!
Long live the King!

383
00:49:05,905 --> 00:49:08,533
我想我们以前没见过面。我叫普律当丝。
I don't think we've met. My name is Prudence.

384
00:49:08,616 --> 00:49:10,869
瓦洛船长，愿为您效劳。
Captain Vallo, at your service.

385
00:49:12,997 --> 00:49:14,331
谢谢你！
Thank you.

386
00:49:46,745 --> 00:49:48,706
你笑什么?
What are you grinning at?

387
00:49:53,795 --> 00:49:56,881
所以，我有一个光环。你怕我变得心软。
So, I'm getting a halo. You're afraid I'm getting soft.

388
00:49:57,757 --> 00:49:59,468
是的,你错了。
Yeah, you're wrong.

389
00:50:01,137 --> 00:50:05,309
只是这是一种新的雀跃。这些人真让我心烦。
It's just that this is a new kind of caper. These people are getting on my nerves.

390
00:50:05,934 --> 00:50:08,270
El Libre和他女儿纯粹是公事公办。
El Libre and his daughter are strictly business.

391
00:50:09,938 --> 00:50:13,234
他们没有把我锁起来。我把他们锁起来了。
They haven't got me chained. I've got them chained.

392
00:50:13,943 --> 00:50:16,071
我很快就能摆脱他们了。
I'll be rid of them soon enough.

393
00:50:16,154 --> 00:50:18,949
明天，我会亲自交给格鲁达男爵。
Tomorrow, I'm delivering them to Baron Gruda personally.

394
00:50:20,242 --> 00:50:21,953
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

395
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:49,193
这个女孩吗?
The girl?

396
00:50:53,824 --> 00:50:55,159
那女孩呢?
What about the girl?

397
00:50:59,206 --> 00:51:00,916
她让我很生气。
She's getting under my skin.

398
00:51:02,042 --> 00:51:04,128
她给我灌输了很多疯狂的想法。
She's putting crazy ideas in my head.

399
00:51:04,879 --> 00:51:09,050
她打开了我的心。她离我太近了。
She's unlocked my heart. She's getting too close to me.

400
00:51:10,552 --> 00:51:12,012
她让我着迷了。
She's got me hooked.

401
00:51:14,139 --> 00:51:15,516
她是盲目的。
She's blind.

402
00:51:16,726 --> 00:51:18,728
我是盲目的。你是盲目的。
I'm blind. You're blind.

403
00:51:19,688 --> 00:51:21,022
盲人是谁?
Who's blind?

404
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:26,028
哦!爱情是盲目的。
Oh! Love is blind.

405
00:51:27,906 --> 00:51:29,533
我没有恋爱!
I am not in love!

406
00:52:16,547 --> 00:52:17,923
停住!
Avast there!

407
00:52:19,717 --> 00:52:23,055
我告诉过你不要这么吵。现在船长会抓到她的。
I told you not to make so much noise. Now the Skipper will get her.

408
00:52:23,138 --> 00:52:25,223
-他总是这样。-没人能得到她。
- He always does. - Nobody will get her.

409
00:52:32,523 --> 00:52:34,193
解开。动!
Untie the others. Move!

410
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:36,070
有什么事吗?我在找点乐子。
What's up? I'm having a little fun.

411
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:39,616
-拜托，船长。让我们找点乐子吧。-你想独享她吗?
- Come on, Skipper. Let us have some fun. - You want her all to yourself?

412
00:52:39,699 --> 00:52:42,911
-你为什么不加入呢?-你为什么不自己试试?
- Why don't you join the fun? - Why don't you try yourself?

413
00:52:42,994 --> 00:52:46,624
-你总是说你去不了。-总是工作，没有乐趣。
- You always tell that you couldn't make it. - Always work and no fun.

414
00:52:59,764 --> 00:53:03,311
贝洛斯先生，把三个都带下去，把舱室钥匙给我。
Mr. Bellows, take all three below and bring me the cabin keys.

415
00:53:03,478 --> 00:53:09,485
如果你能原谅我指出来的话，船长…我们不能把一个漂亮女人留在船上不受骚扰。
If you'll forgive my pointing it out, Skipper... we can't leave a pretty woman unmolested aboard ship.

416
00:53:09,943 --> 00:53:12,237
这会给盗版带来坏名声。
It will give piracy a bad name.

417
00:53:12,363 --> 00:53:14,198
你在挑战我的命令吗?
Are you challenging my orders?

418
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:26,255
我绝不会那么做的，船长…但你还是要把这些鸽子卖给格鲁达男爵……我想先跟他们玩玩也无妨。
I'd never do that, Skipper... but seeing thou is selling these pigeons to Baron Gruda anyway... I thought there could be no harm to sport with them a bit first.

419
00:53:27,923 --> 00:53:29,675
没有进攻,队长。
No offense, Skipper.

420
00:53:44,651 --> 00:53:47,821
我明天就让你在眼镜蛇号上岸，把枪给你。
I'm putting you ashore tomorrow at Cobra and giving you the guns.

421
00:53:48,906 --> 00:53:50,283
你们所有的人。
All of you.

422
00:53:51,993 --> 00:53:53,745
别谢我就行。
Just don't thank me.

423
00:54:32,791 --> 00:54:34,043
队长。
Skipper.

424
00:54:43,136 --> 00:54:46,307
是的，那是我们的船。格鲁达男爵在等着。
Yes, there's our ship. With Baron Gruda waiting.

425
00:54:46,808 --> 00:54:52,523
难道他不讨厌为El Libre付钱吗?当他发现我们把他从国王的监狱里偷出来
Won't he hate paying for El Libre... when he finds out we stole him out of one of the King's own prisons?

426
00:54:55,652 --> 00:54:59,447
-我们将坚持到天黑。-是，是，船长。
- We'll heave to onto the point till nightfall. - Aye, aye, Skipper.

427
00:55:04,453 --> 00:55:05,621
Slimey。
Slimey.

428
00:55:15,759 --> 00:55:20,014
让我们看你游到那边的岛上去。-是的，然后又回来了。
- Let's see thee swim to yonder island. - Aye, and back again.

429
00:55:20,514 --> 00:55:24,310
如果我的计划成功，格鲁达男爵会亲自护送你回去。
If my plan works, Baron Gruda himself will escort thee back.

430
00:55:24,769 --> 00:55:26,813
我要你带个口信给他。
I've a message for thee to give to him.

431
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:31,820
照做，等我当上船长…你将成为大副。
Do it, and when I am skipper... thou wilt be first mate.

432
00:55:35,281 --> 00:55:36,784
波纹管先生……
Mr. Bellows...

433
00:55:38,828 --> 00:55:41,956
-鲨鱼呢?-他们从不攻击人。
- what about sharks? - They never attack a man.

434
00:55:42,624 --> 00:55:44,835
除非他先攻击他们。
Unless he attacks them first.

435
00:55:55,639 --> 00:55:57,391
——州长。——男爵?
- Governor. - Baron?

436
00:55:58,100 --> 00:56:01,730
-让他去厨房喂他。——厨房。喂他。
- Send him to the kitchen and feed him. - Kitchen. Feed him.

437
00:56:04,941 --> 00:56:07,487
你会为他们准备好10万金币弗罗林。
You'll have the 100,000 gold florin ready for them.

438
00:56:07,528 --> 00:56:09,822
只要阁下下令。
Whatever Your Excellency orders.

439
00:56:09,906 --> 00:56:21,920
-但这纯粹是盗版。我向你保证…我要让他的女儿埃尔·利布雷，他杰出的同谋者……我们的船，我们的枪，那些海盗，还有瓦洛船长，连一个苏都没付。
- But this is sheer piracy. - I assure you... I shall have El Libre, his daughter, his distinguished conspirator... our ship, our guns, the pirates, and Captain Vallo, without paying a sou.

440
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:25,383
-那为什么是10万?我说，把钱准备好。
- Then why 100,000? - Have the money ready, I said.

441
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:31,181
大副认为他能毁掉瓦洛，但他的计划可能会失败。
The first mate thinks he can undo Vallo, but his plan may fail.

442
00:56:32,015 --> 00:56:35,602
即使我们要付钱，这样的运货价格翻倍也算便宜了。
Even if we have to pay, such a haul would be cheap at double the price.

443
00:56:35,686 --> 00:56:40,900
顺便说一下…我要一桶这个，好好下药。
By the way... I shall want a barrel of this, well drugged.

444
00:56:49,286 --> 00:56:51,371
-你干掉了瓦洛船长?——没有。
- You disposed of Captain Vallo? - No.

445
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:54,542
有必要先让船员们知道他的情况。
It will be necessary to expose him to the crew first.

446
00:56:54,626 --> 00:56:58,630
如果你听从了我的指示，我很快就会这么做的。
Which I'll be doing soon enough, if thou has followed my instructions.

447
00:56:58,713 --> 00:57:00,216
这封信。
To the letter.

448
00:57:00,549 --> 00:57:03,427
和钱吗?请原谅我的急躁。
And the money? If you'll forgive my impatience.

449
00:57:03,511 --> 00:57:05,681
明天早上它会等着你的。
It will be waiting for you in the morning.

450
00:57:05,764 --> 00:57:09,017
与此同时，我把自己交给你作为担保。
Meanwhile, I place myself in your hands as security for it.

451
00:57:09,101 --> 00:57:10,435
很好。
Very well.

452
00:57:10,519 --> 00:57:14,107
但我提醒你，他们两手空空的时候是杀人的。
But I remind thee, they be murderous hands when they're empty.

453
00:57:15,817 --> 00:57:17,820
把大人藏在下面。
Hide His Excellency below.

454
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:53,153
一旦上层安全了，奥乔就会带着小船在下面待命。
As soon as it's clear topside, Ojo will stand by below with a small boat.

455
00:57:53,195 --> 00:57:56,198
靠岸很短。打电话给你的父亲。
It's a short pull to shore. Call your father.

456
00:58:29,822 --> 00:58:32,241
加入我们吧。加入我们的行列。
Come with us. Join us.

457
00:58:34,326 --> 00:58:35,328
不。
No.

458
00:58:37,205 --> 00:58:40,083
但是你想要。我知道你想。
But you want to. I know you want to.

459
00:58:41,252 --> 00:58:42,712
你错了。
You're wrong.

460
00:58:43,587 --> 00:58:46,592
对我没有任何好处。让你的父亲。
There's nothing in it for me. Get your father.

461
00:58:51,388 --> 00:58:53,433
那你为什么放我们自由?
Then why are you setting us free?

462
00:58:53,516 --> 00:58:56,895
-我信守诺言，即使是愚蠢的诺言。-你没有承诺。
- I keep my promises, even foolish ones. - You made no promise.

463
00:58:56,978 --> 00:59:00,066
你说要把我们卖了，你不能这么做。
You made a deal to sell us, and you can't do it.

464
00:59:00,399 --> 00:59:04,236
好吧,。我这么做是为了你。我们就到这里吧。
All right, then. I'm doing it for you. Let's leave it at that.

465
00:59:05,238 --> 00:59:08,075
不,法洛。我们不能就这么算了。
No, Vallo. We can't leave it at that.

466
00:59:08,825 --> 00:59:11,162
你是一个战士。与我们战斗。
You're a fighter. Fight with us.

467
00:59:11,746 --> 00:59:14,165
-争取一些体面的东西。——而不是我。
- Fight for something decent. - Not I.

468
00:59:14,749 --> 00:59:18,879
在我的一生中，我看到不公正和不诚实打着体面的旗号。
All my life I've watched injustice and dishonesty fly the flag of decency.

469
00:59:18,921 --> 00:59:21,799
-我不信任他们。-你不信任我吗?
- I don't trust them. - Don't you trust me?

470
00:59:24,845 --> 00:59:27,764
你不相信我们之间的感情吗?
Don't you trust what we have for each other?

471
00:59:27,889 --> 00:59:31,144
我们对彼此的感情我们必须克服。
What we have for each other we'll have to get over.

472
00:59:33,563 --> 00:59:34,773
我们可以吗?
Can we?

473
00:59:53,128 --> 00:59:55,506
你是对的。我不会让你走的。
You're right. I won't let you go.

474
00:59:56,507 --> 01:00:00,303
在我的船上，我们是属于一起的。我们会找到办法的。
We belong together here, aboard my ship. We'll find a way.

475
01:00:02,597 --> 01:00:03,975
但这是不可能的。
But that's not possible.

476
01:00:05,226 --> 01:00:09,355
-我不能待在这里。你没有看见吗?-我明白了。
- I can't stay here. Don't you see? - Yes, I see.

477
01:00:10,774 --> 01:00:13,110
现在，你终于也看到了。
And now, at last, you see it, too.

478
01:00:13,986 --> 01:00:16,781
你有你的世界，我有我的。
You've got your world, and I've got mine.

479
01:00:22,121 --> 01:00:23,914
好吧,先生们。
All right, gentlemen.

480
01:00:27,461 --> 01:00:28,712
坐下来。
Sit down.

481
01:00:30,756 --> 01:00:33,635
教授，你稍后带着巴勃罗·墨菲和枪上岸。
Professor, you'll go ashore later with Pablo Murphy and the guns.

482
01:00:33,676 --> 01:00:36,513
——正确的。-继续自言自语，大声说。
- Right. - Keep talking to yourself, loudly.

483
01:00:36,596 --> 01:00:39,057
我想让我的人以为你们还在这里。
I want my men to think you're all still here.

484
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:41,143
这对我来说不是问题。
That's no problem for me.

485
01:00:41,352 --> 01:00:44,063
记住，这是个危险的游戏。
Now, remember, this is a dangerous game.

486
01:00:44,230 --> 01:00:47,734
如果我的人屈服了，他们会割了你的喉咙，还有我的。
If my men tumble to it, they'll slit your throats, and mine, too.

487
01:00:47,818 --> 01:00:49,778
我不喜欢这样，上尉。
I don't like it, Captain.

488
01:00:50,237 --> 01:00:53,741
我们不能让你独自面对他们。加入我们吧。
We can't leave you to face them alone. Come with us.

489
01:00:54,826 --> 01:00:57,663
父亲……不喜欢。
Father... don't.

490
01:01:44,594 --> 01:01:46,345
停住!人的枪!
Avast! Man the guns!

491
01:01:54,104 --> 01:01:55,856
在甲板上,你拭子!
Topside, you swabs!

492
01:02:10,290 --> 01:02:11,416
的帮助!
Help!

493
01:02:17,006 --> 01:02:20,386
别急，船长，恕我冒昧。
Not so fast, Skipper, if you'll pardon the intrusion.

494
01:02:40,826 --> 01:02:44,372
你把我卖给了一个国王的仆从，卑微的风箱。
You've sold me, Humble Bellows, and to a king's flunky.

495
01:02:44,456 --> 01:02:45,499
看不见你。
Aye.

496
01:02:45,999 --> 01:02:53,800
我谦虚地认为，没有人能像海盗一样飞翔……不愿意出卖自己的朋友，爱人和母亲的人。
'Tis my modest opinion that no man can fly pirate's colors... who's not willing to sell his friend, his sweetheart, or his mother.

497
01:02:53,883 --> 01:02:56,887
-说得好，贝洛斯先生。-说得难听。
- Well spoken, Mr. Bellows. - Foul spoken it is.

498
01:02:57,263 --> 01:02:59,807
你的手碰到了队长的背。
You've turned your hand against your Captain's back.

499
01:02:59,890 --> 01:03:01,977
黄色从来不是海盗的颜色。
Yellow was never a pirate's color.

500
01:03:02,102 --> 01:03:04,938
拯救一个美丽的少女也不是海盗的行为。
Nor rescuing a fair maiden a pirate caper.

501
01:03:05,730 --> 01:03:06,815
看不见你。
Aye.

502
01:03:07,607 --> 01:03:14,742
这是真的。我驶出了我的纵深……但只是为了为我们大家探索新的领域。
It's true. I sailed beyond my depth... but only to sound out new waters for the lot of us.

503
01:03:14,825 --> 01:03:19,038
如果我们都饿死了，我就不会把你卖了。
If we'd have starved to death, I'd have never sold a man jack of you.

504
01:03:21,416 --> 01:03:25,378
聚集,小伙子。这不是最后一次海盗活动。
Gather round, lads. This isn't the last of the pirate capers.

505
01:03:25,421 --> 01:03:32,971
这是最后的你和你的刺山柑……因为当你试图剥夺我们的战利品时，它已经被付诸表决了。
'Tis the last of thee and of thy capers... for 'twas put to the vote whilst thee was trying to deprive us of our loot.

506
01:03:33,055 --> 01:03:37,101
叶违反了海盗守则，放了一条肥鱼。
Ye violated the pirate code by letting a fat fish off the hook.

507
01:03:38,395 --> 01:03:48,573
全体投票决定，你被剥夺指挥权……并根据海盗法被判乘小船漂流没有食物和水。
By vote of all, ye are deprived of command... and sentenced under piratical law to be cast adrift in a small boat... without food or water.

508
01:03:51,201 --> 01:03:55,248
一个绝妙的决定，贝洛斯先生。快判死刑
A splendid decision, Mr. Bellows. Quick justice and certain death.

509
01:03:56,082 --> 01:04:02,590
也许你可以省下国王绞死这个博学的傻瓜的代价……让他和瓦洛船长作伴。
Perhaps you'd save the King the expense of hanging this learned fool... and let him keep Captain Vallo company.

510
01:04:03,883 --> 01:04:06,010
你有慷慨的选择。
Thou hast a generous choice.

511
01:04:06,302 --> 01:04:08,221
绞刑架或大海。
The gallows or the sea.

512
01:04:16,606 --> 01:04:18,441
如果它不挤你的话。
If it won't crowd you.

513
01:04:20,444 --> 01:04:24,073
我宁愿你不来，但我也不想显得不好客。
I'd rather you weren't coming, but I don't want to seem inhospitable.

514
01:04:25,826 --> 01:04:36,296
至于你…既然我没有声音反对你们船长的轻罪……把你的手交给你的新船长，你就会得到宽恕。
As for thee... since I have no voice to raise against thy Captain's misdemeanors... thee will be pardoned by giving thy hand to thy new skipper.

515
01:04:36,587 --> 01:04:39,883
说你什么?我们可以解开你的绳索吗?
What say thee? Shall we loose thy bonds?

516
01:04:51,564 --> 01:04:53,066
抑制他的嚣张气焰。
Cut him loose.

517
01:05:28,816 --> 01:05:31,695
这是完成,队长。我们让他们漂流。
It's done, Skipper. We set them adrift.

518
01:05:32,196 --> 01:05:35,032
早潮将带他们出海。
The morning tide will take them out to sea.

519
01:05:45,169 --> 01:05:48,423
等等!这需要庆祝一下，对吧，贝洛斯先生?
Wait! This calls for a celebration, eh, Mr. Bellows?

520
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:52,844
我的船上有一桶朗姆酒。直接从总督的酒窖里拿的。
I've a keg of rum aboard my boat. Straight from the Governor's own cellar.

521
01:05:52,928 --> 01:05:54,180
说什么?
What say?

522
01:05:55,765 --> 01:05:56,849
看不见你。
Aye.

523
01:05:57,225 --> 01:05:58,726
我想喝一杯。
I could use a drink.

524
01:05:59,143 --> 01:06:01,564
来吧,小伙子们!把朗姆酒弄上船。
Come on, lads! Get the rum aboard.

525
01:06:05,067 --> 01:06:07,487
把我的拿去船长的舱房。
Bring mine to the Captain's cabin.

526
01:06:13,536 --> 01:06:16,539
这是陆地的尽头。我们世界的末日。
There's the end of land. The end of our world.

527
01:06:16,664 --> 01:06:19,418
从现在开始，饥饿，干渴，最终倾覆。
From now on, it's starve, thirst, and finally capsize.

528
01:06:20,002 --> 01:06:22,421
我一直在思考这个问题。
I've been meditating on just that.

529
01:06:22,838 --> 01:06:27,010
倾覆是解决问题的办法。这是毫无疑问的。
Capsizing is the solution of our problem. There's no doubt about it.

530
01:06:28,178 --> 01:06:30,848
-请跟我来。-坐下，你这个傻瓜!
- If you'll follow me, please. - Sit down, you fool!

531
01:06:34,227 --> 01:06:35,688
坐下来,你……
Sit down, you...

532
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:08,643
它的工作原理。
It works.

533
01:07:10,353 --> 01:07:12,105
美好的亚里士多德。
Good old Aristotle.

534
01:07:12,147 --> 01:07:14,525
2000多年前，他写道:
Over 2,000 years ago, he wrote:

535
01:07:14,608 --> 01:07:18,488
金属容器可以在水下保持空气，而不用填充。
"A metallic vessel will retain air underwater without filling. "

536
01:07:18,530 --> 01:07:24,745
但我自己对此做了一些研究……同时设计一艘我称之为“海底船”的船。
But I myself have done some research on the subject... while designing a craft which I call an undersea boat.

537
01:07:24,829 --> 01:07:31,962
-你怎么知道这是无懈可击的?-在科学方面，我的儿子…一个人不做实验就什么都不知道。
- How did you know this was airtight? - In science, my son... one knows nothing until one experiments.

538
01:07:33,171 --> 01:07:36,009
我们现在可以断定我们是在呼吸。
We may now conclude that we are breathing.

539
01:07:36,175 --> 01:07:38,678
让我们尽快上岸吧。
Let us walk ashore as quickly as possible.

540
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:42,224
我估计这里的空气足够我们呼吸几分钟。
I compute there's sufficient air to last us several minutes.

541
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:45,186
当然，前提是我们不浪费氧气说话。
Providing we don't waste our oxygen talking, of course.

542
01:07:45,269 --> 01:07:47,814
-那好吧。闭嘴!——如此。
- All right, then. Shut up! - Quite so.

543
01:09:55,506 --> 01:09:59,595
你没必要把整个守军都带出来。我自己干的。
You needn't have brought out the whole garrison. I did the job myself.

544
01:09:59,678 --> 01:10:02,389
他们这次醒来就不会那么爱玩了。
They won't be so playful when they wake up this time.

545
01:10:02,473 --> 01:10:04,434
好吧。叫醒他们。
All right. Wake them up.

546
01:10:04,684 --> 01:10:06,895
让他们清醒，然后带他们去海盗船。
Sober them up and take them to the pirate ship.

547
01:10:06,978 --> 01:10:08,730
跟他们一起翻到一边去!
Over the side with them!

548
01:10:37,556 --> 01:10:40,560
我很抱歉，伙计们。我谦卑地道歉。
Sorry I be for this, mates. And I humbly apologize.

549
01:10:40,602 --> 01:10:43,396
如果瓦洛当船长就不会发生这种事。
'Twould never have happened with Vallo as skipper.

550
01:10:43,730 --> 01:10:46,692
他违反了海盗守则，必须离开。
He violated a pirate code and he had to go.

551
01:10:47,109 --> 01:10:50,404
但是他像海盗一样去了。我们像鱼一样前进。
But he went like a pirate. We're going like fish.

552
01:10:50,447 --> 01:10:53,116
我不能原谅我自己。
I can't forgive myself for that.

553
01:10:54,409 --> 01:10:57,705
国王的走狗把谦卑的风箱变成了猴子。
King's flunky made a monkey of Humble Bellows.

554
01:10:58,081 --> 01:11:00,917
-老派海盗。-够了!
- Pirate of the old school. - Enough of that!

555
01:11:00,959 --> 01:11:02,336
提升他们!
Hoist them!

556
01:11:08,385 --> 01:11:11,054
派一组船员上船，重新排查。
Put a crew aboard this ship and have her re-canvased.

557
01:11:11,096 --> 01:11:13,724
我要她在我离开时准备好起航。
I want her ready to sail when I leave.

558
01:11:14,016 --> 01:11:17,562
给他们足够的面包和水让他们活下去。
Give them just enough bread and water to keep them alive.

559
01:11:17,645 --> 01:11:20,482
他们会从国王那里得到一大笔赏金。
They'll fetch a good bounty from the King.

560
01:11:55,565 --> 01:11:57,317
喂。巴勃罗·墨菲。
Ahoy. Pablo Murphy.

561
01:11:58,944 --> 01:12:01,321
-嗯，我会…-把我们从铁链上弄下来。
- Well, I'll be... - Get us out of these chains.

562
01:12:01,405 --> 01:12:04,617
你让我们卷入了这么多，你这个谎话连篇的大嘴巴?
After all you got us into, you lying blabbermouth?

563
01:12:04,659 --> 01:12:06,578
让你自己摆脱它。
Get yourself out of it.

564
01:12:19,384 --> 01:12:22,597
——巴勃罗·墨菲。-最后说一次，离我们远点
- Pablo Murphy. - For the last time, get away from us.

565
01:12:23,098 --> 01:12:25,684
用你的脑子想想，我没有出卖El Libre
Get it through that head of yours, I didn't sell El Libre.

566
01:12:25,768 --> 01:12:28,646
-我向你保证…-我们可以亲眼看到他做了什么。
- Let me assure... - We can see for ourselves what he's done.

567
01:12:28,688 --> 01:12:31,441
如果我们走我的路，El Libre就不会死。
If we'd gone my way, El Libre wouldn't be dead.

568
01:12:31,525 --> 01:12:36,822
康斯韦洛不会被囚禁在宫殿里……我们就有枪来阻止格鲁达的人碾压我们。
Consuelo wouldn't be held captive in the palace... and we'd have guns to stop Gruda's men from crushing us.

569
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:39,075
抓住它,先生们。士兵。
Hold it, gentlemen. Soldiers.

570
01:12:48,210 --> 01:12:52,549
格鲁达男爵下令，所有捕鱼活动都将在武装护卫下进行。
By order of Baron Gruda, all fishing will be done under armed escort.

571
01:12:52,799 --> 01:12:55,219
所有的鱼都要交给总督。
The entire catch to be turned over to the Governor.

572
01:12:55,261 --> 01:12:57,513
-我们还剩下什么?——这是诱饵。
- What'll be left for us? - The bait.

573
01:12:57,847 --> 01:12:59,724
那样的话，我们就不钓鱼了。
In that case, we'll do no fishing.

574
01:13:01,894 --> 01:13:03,646
任何更多的反对意见?
Any more objections?

575
01:13:04,855 --> 01:13:07,984
剩下的人去州长的码头。行动起来!
The rest of you proceed to the Governor's dock. Get moving!

576
01:13:09,402 --> 01:13:11,404
带他去堡垒。
Take him to the fortress.

577
01:13:26,256 --> 01:13:27,549
这种方式。
This way.

578
01:14:10,182 --> 01:14:13,270
-嘿，回来排队。-跟着那些船。
- Hey, there, back in line. - Follow those boats.

579
01:14:47,936 --> 01:14:49,312
之后他们!
After them!

580
01:16:11,118 --> 01:16:12,369
我们走吧。
Let's go.

581
01:16:44,823 --> 01:16:48,119
-都安排好了吗?-遵命，阁下。
- Is everything arranged? - Just as you ordered, Excellency.

582
01:16:48,161 --> 01:16:51,665
你一夜之间就打垮了叛军。国王欠你太多了。
You've broken the back of the rebellion overnight. The King owes you much.

583
01:16:51,748 --> 01:16:59,842
他会付出代价的。我甚至可以在干掉瓦洛船长时拿到全部赏金…因为他在试图拯救El Libre的时候被自己的人杀死了。
He will pay it. I may even be able to collect the full bounty on Captain Vallo... for he was killed by his own men while trying to save El Libre.

584
01:17:04,012 --> 01:17:05,974
别难过，亲爱的。
Don't be upset, my dear.

585
01:17:06,349 --> 01:17:10,020
您将在这里形成新的附件。你要嫁给总督。
You'll form new attachments here. You're to marry the Governor.

586
01:17:10,103 --> 01:17:12,857
我死后，你将通过她来统治，州长。
After I'm gone, you'll rule through her, Governor.

587
01:17:12,940 --> 01:17:17,988
你会命令你的人民耕种他们的土地，捕鱼他们的海洋…为了国王更大的荣耀。
You'll order your people to till their fields and fish their seas... for the greater glory of the King.

588
01:17:18,030 --> 01:17:20,782
-我宁愿死。-不，你是最后一个死的。
- I'd die first. - No, you'll die last.

589
01:17:21,158 --> 01:17:24,162
首先你要看着你的人一个接一个离开。
First you'll watch your people go one by one.

590
01:17:42,725 --> 01:17:44,561
总有一天我会杀了你。
Someday I'll kill you.

591
01:17:46,188 --> 01:17:47,398
官!
Officer!

592
01:17:53,655 --> 01:17:55,699
这些方法很快就会使她苏醒过来。
These methods will bring her round soon.

593
01:17:55,782 --> 01:17:58,578
我不希望她在结婚前自杀。
I shouldn't like her to kill herself before she marries.

594
01:17:58,619 --> 01:18:02,665
她不是那种人。她会嫁给你，伺机毒死你。
She's not the type. She'll marry you and wait for a chance to poison you.

595
01:18:02,749 --> 01:18:06,212
听起来不像是理想的婚姻。难道我们不能放弃它吗?
It doesn't sound like an ideal marriage. Couldn't we dispense with that?

596
01:18:06,253 --> 01:18:08,589
吃太多会让我的肝脏不舒服。
Too much of it upsets my liver.

597
01:18:10,550 --> 01:18:14,387
不是你的肝脏。这是你的的心。太软了。
It's not your liver. It's your heart. It's much too soft.

598
01:18:17,642 --> 01:18:20,103
今晚，人民将埋葬El Libre
Tonight the people bury El Libre.

599
01:18:20,353 --> 01:18:26,318
我要一张布告贴在送葬队伍行进的路上。宣布你与El Libre的女儿结婚。
I want a proclamation posted in the path of the funeral procession... announcing your marriage to the daughter of El Libre.

600
01:18:26,402 --> 01:18:27,737
阁下!
Excellency!

601
01:18:28,446 --> 01:18:34,078
人们将被要求参加并提供娱乐。让它成为一个欢乐的日子。
People will be required to attend and provide entertainment... to make it a day of rejoicing.

602
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:38,833
我们会让他们填满皇家粮仓…带着一万袋粮食作为礼物。
We'll have them fill the royal grain warehouse... with 10,000 sacks of grain as a present.

603
01:18:39,334 --> 01:18:41,128
你学习得很快。
You're learning fast.

604
01:18:41,253 --> 01:18:45,800
仪式结束后，我将把我的部队和祝福留给你们，然后离开。
After the ceremony, I'll leave you my troops and my blessings, and depart.

605
01:18:47,635 --> 01:18:52,141
除了已故的瓦洛，这是一项最无聊的任务。
Except for the late, lamented Vallo, this has been a most boring assignment.

606
01:19:02,903 --> 01:19:06,574
上路吧，猪!已宣布大赦所有囚犯。
On your way, pig! Amnesty has been declared for all prisoners.

607
01:19:06,658 --> 01:19:10,204
格鲁达男爵会给你一个在婚礼上表达忠诚的机会。
Baron Gruda will give you a chance to show allegiance at the wedding.

608
01:19:11,330 --> 01:19:12,540
Gruda。
Gruda.

609
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:16,795
格鲁达，总有一天我会杀了你。
Gruda, someday I'll kill you.

610
01:19:17,838 --> 01:19:19,298
我要杀了你!
I'll kill you!

611
01:19:21,509 --> 01:19:25,054
-所以现在是婚姻了，是吗?-康丝埃洛不会这么做的。
- So it's a marriage now, is it? - Consuelo will never do it.

612
01:19:25,138 --> 01:19:27,975
看!一万袋粮食给总督。
Look! 10,000 sacks of grain for the Governor.

613
01:19:28,017 --> 01:19:29,310
不是我的!
Not mine!

614
01:19:29,685 --> 01:19:31,645
所以我们应该庆幸，是吗?
So we're to rejoice, are we?

615
01:19:45,579 --> 01:19:53,922
格鲁达男爵破坏了公共财产…可判处死刑的罪行无论是罪犯还是同谋。
Baron Gruda has made the defacing of public property... an offense punishable by death... both for the culprit and the accomplices.

616
01:19:54,256 --> 01:19:56,592
中士，把这些人集合起来。
Sergeant, round up these people.

617
01:20:26,086 --> 01:20:29,381
-你打算怎么做?-这不关我的事
- What are you going to do about it? - It's no concern of mine.

618
01:20:37,933 --> 01:20:41,228
-你要拿她怎么办?-想办法把她弄出来
- What are you going to do about her? - Get her out of it, somehow.

619
01:20:41,645 --> 01:20:44,065
一个人对抗一千名士兵?
Alone, against 1,000 troops?

620
01:20:44,607 --> 01:20:46,818
-一定有办法的。——有。
- There must be a way. - There is.

621
01:20:46,901 --> 01:20:49,989
这是一个简单的逻辑问题。我们需要盟国。
It's a question of simple logic. We need allies.

622
01:20:50,406 --> 01:20:53,034
这些人需要自由。让我们帮助他们得到它。
These people need freedom. Let's help them get it.

623
01:20:53,117 --> 01:20:55,619
我唯一感兴趣的是康丝薇洛的自由。
The only freedom I'm interested in is Consuelo's.

624
01:20:55,704 --> 01:20:58,916
在她的人民获得自由之前她是不会同意获得自由的。
She'll never consent to be free until her people are free.

625
01:20:58,957 --> 01:21:00,334
不可能的。
Impossible.

626
01:21:00,959 --> 01:21:03,588
他们对付不了格鲁达的精锐部队。
They don't have a chance against Gruda's crack troops.

627
01:21:03,671 --> 01:21:06,758
科学告诉我们，没有什么是不可能的。
Science has learned that nothing is impossible.

628
01:21:06,799 --> 01:21:14,935
不久前，我看到一艘船在法国的天空中航行……被一个充满空气的大袋子支撑着它比空气还轻。
Not long ago, I saw a ship sailing through the skies of France... supported by a great bag filled with air that was lighter than air.

629
01:21:15,602 --> 01:21:19,816
我的一个朋友发明了一种可以炸开高山的液体。
A friend of mine has invented a liquid that can blast away mountains.

630
01:21:20,274 --> 01:21:24,487
我已经完成了一艘能在水下航行的船的计划。
I have completed plans for a boat that can sail underneath the water.

631
01:21:25,154 --> 01:21:30,119
谁知道我们会完成什么……反对过时的格鲁达男爵和他过时的世界?
Who knows what we may accomplish... against the outdated Baron Gruda and his outdated world?

632
01:21:30,202 --> 01:21:37,462
我们只需要这些人的帮助…一点想象力，和灵巧的手指偷一些基本的材料。
All we need is the help of these people... a little imagination, and deft fingers with which to steal a few basic materials.

633
01:22:03,617 --> 01:22:05,369
男爵认为我们完蛋了。
The Baron thinks we're finished.

634
01:22:05,452 --> 01:22:07,998
我们要让他继续这么想。
We're going to let him go on thinking so.

635
01:22:08,081 --> 01:22:10,834
我们会按订单填满皇家粮仓。
We'll fill the royal grain warehouse as ordered.

636
01:22:10,875 --> 01:22:13,212
但有了教授的天才种子。
But with the seeds of the Professor's genius.

637
01:22:13,254 --> 01:22:16,549
-你说什么?男爵拥有最多的武器。
- I beg your pardon? - The Baron has the most weapons.

638
01:22:16,632 --> 01:22:18,134
但我们会有最新的。
But we'll have the newest.

639
01:22:18,217 --> 01:22:21,388
可以移动山脉的炸药。船:在空中飞行的船
An explosive that moves mountains. A ship that flies through the air.

640
01:22:21,471 --> 01:22:25,268
下周日就能飞起来的船?不可能的。
A ship that flies through the air by next Sunday? Impossible.

641
01:22:25,810 --> 01:22:27,645
一位伟人曾对我说:
A great man once said to me:

642
01:22:27,729 --> 01:22:30,231
“科学已经知道，没有什么是不可能的。”
"Science has learned that nothing is impossible. "

643
01:22:33,611 --> 01:22:35,863
小伙子们，姑娘们，围过来。
Gather round, lads and lasses.

644
01:22:36,322 --> 01:22:40,744
我们将向你们的战士和工人展示摆脱旧敌人的新方法。
We'll show your fighters and workers new ways to get rid of old enemies.

645
01:23:34,307 --> 01:23:36,227
闻起来不对劲。
It doesn't smell right.

646
01:23:37,812 --> 01:23:40,565
一万袋粮食已运进仓库。
10,000 sacks of grain have been brought into the warehouse.

647
01:23:40,648 --> 01:23:42,734
把他们偷运出去的隧道已经打通了。
The tunnel to smuggle them out is complete.

648
01:23:42,818 --> 01:23:50,535
这个岛屿在走私现代化武器方面取得了进展。而你依然站在那里，动弹不得……炖菜没有结果。
The island is making headway with the modern weapons to smuggle in... and still you stand and stir... that stew with no result.

649
01:23:50,618 --> 01:23:57,084
我的朋友没有给我配方……简单的成分。主要是氮和甘油。
My friend sent me no formula to go on... simply the ingredients. Principally nitrogen and glycerin.

650
01:23:57,168 --> 01:23:59,671
不管怎样，我不确定我是否想去发现它。
Anyway, I'm not really sure I want to discover it.

651
01:23:59,755 --> 01:24:03,509
如果它能移走一座山，我怎么知道它不会移走一座岛?
If it can remove a mountain, how do I know it won't remove an island?

652
01:24:03,550 --> 01:24:06,638
“在科学上，不做实验什么都不知道。”
"In science, one knows nothing unless one experiments. "

653
01:24:06,721 --> 01:24:08,932
我希望你别再引用我的话了。
I wish you'd stop quoting me.

654
01:24:15,856 --> 01:24:17,693
就是这样。
That's it.

655
01:24:25,535 --> 01:24:26,828
士兵们!
Soldiers!

656
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:32,042
别被那件事打倒。
Don't fall down with that.

657
01:24:32,293 --> 01:24:34,211
即使他们朝你开枪。
Even if they shoot you.

658
01:25:04,372 --> 01:25:07,251
早上小心别充气过度。
Be careful you don't over-inflate this in the morning.

659
01:25:07,584 --> 01:25:10,087
我们已经把墙上的支架切到了极限。
We've cut the wall braces to the breaking point.

660
01:25:10,170 --> 01:25:13,425
但我们不希望它们在信号发出前崩溃。
But we don't want them to collapse before the signal.

661
01:25:13,466 --> 01:25:18,639
记得……在康苏埃洛安全离开格鲁达男爵之前不会发出信号。
Remember... there'll be no signal given till Consuelo's gotten safely away from Baron Gruda.

662
01:25:25,355 --> 01:25:26,565
小心。
Careful.

663
01:25:33,448 --> 01:25:35,242
液体炸药。
The liquid explosive.

664
01:25:36,869 --> 01:25:40,582
-就剩下这些了吗?-我改进了一下公式。
- Is that all that's left? - I've improved a bit on the formula.

665
01:25:40,624 --> 01:25:43,126
浓缩了1000倍。
This is concentrated 1,000 times.

666
01:25:53,639 --> 01:25:54,890
请。
Please.

667
01:26:35,397 --> 01:26:39,025
据报道，皇家粮仓已经满仓了，阁下。
The royal grain warehouse is reported full to capacity, Your Excellency.

668
01:26:39,109 --> 01:26:42,029
你怎么能让他们屈服。
Amazing how you brought them to their knees.

669
01:26:42,071 --> 01:26:46,410
孩子不打不成器。永远不要忘记，我亲爱的州长。
Spare the rod and spoil the child. Never forget that, my dear Governor.

670
01:26:47,077 --> 01:26:49,246
我们继续举行婚礼吧。
Let's get on with the wedding ceremony.

671
01:26:51,958 --> 01:26:56,671
首先，岛上的未婚女孩为新娘献上鲜花。
First, a floral offering for the bride from the unmarried girls of the island.

672
01:26:56,713 --> 01:26:59,258
当地庆祝婚礼的习俗
A local custom for celebrating weddings.

673
01:26:59,342 --> 01:27:01,135
——继续。——音乐。
- Proceed. - Music.

674
01:27:37,428 --> 01:27:39,765
看。你的胡子露出来了。
Watch it. Your beard is showing.

675
01:27:40,390 --> 01:27:41,767
我们开始吧。
Here we go.

676
01:27:47,190 --> 01:27:49,859
这些乡下人的模样不合我的口味。
These peasant shapes are not to my taste.

677
01:28:01,999 --> 01:28:03,376
死亡Gruda !
Death to Gruda!

678
01:28:15,182 --> 01:28:16,516
杀了他们!
Kill them!

679
01:28:47,511 --> 01:28:49,596
左舷电池。火!
Port side battery. Fire!

680
01:28:58,190 --> 01:29:00,443
不，我是说左边。离开了!
No, I mean left. Left!

681
01:29:00,526 --> 01:29:02,821
不。正确的。不，留了一点。
No. Right. No, left a bit.

682
01:29:04,323 --> 01:29:05,908
你怎么了?
What's the matter with you?

683
01:29:05,991 --> 01:29:08,118
你不知道你要去哪里吗?
Don't you know where you're going?

684
01:29:33,691 --> 01:29:34,775
火!
Fire!

685
01:29:45,747 --> 01:29:47,457
我们去追那个女孩。
We're going after the girl.

686
01:30:17,909 --> 01:30:19,286
让我们脱光吧。
Let's strip for action.

687
01:30:27,379 --> 01:30:28,464
停止!
Halt!

688
01:30:31,468 --> 01:30:34,304
我们要把她碎尸万段。男人你的大炮。
We'll cut her to pieces. Man your cannons.

689
01:30:35,722 --> 01:30:36,932
来吧,现在。
Come on, now.

690
01:30:45,234 --> 01:30:47,277
高爆炸药。快。
The high explosive. Quick.

691
01:31:24,781 --> 01:31:27,200
——开始!-是，是，先生。
- Get underway! - Aye, aye, sir.

692
01:31:29,702 --> 01:31:31,288
男人的绞盘!
Man the capstan!

693
01:31:36,210 --> 01:31:37,712
让她下面。
Get her below.

694
01:31:39,381 --> 01:31:41,591
不要浪费时间。狭缝的电缆!
Don't waste time. Slit the cable!

695
01:31:46,180 --> 01:31:49,226
我们得提高高度。卸压舱物。
We've got to gain altitude. Unload the ballast.

696
01:31:57,235 --> 01:31:59,070
来吧。摆脱某物
Come on. Get rid of something.

697
01:32:10,084 --> 01:32:12,754
-这是什么?这是上天的愤怒!
- What is it? - It is the wrath of heaven!

698
01:32:12,837 --> 01:32:14,756
它摧毁了堡垒!
It has destroyed the fortress!

699
01:32:17,092 --> 01:32:19,804
我们的船和我们的人。我们正朝他们冲去。
Our ship and our lads. We're heading straight for them.

700
01:32:21,222 --> 01:32:22,723
使它关闭。
Make it close.

701
01:32:24,935 --> 01:32:26,436
但不要太近。
But not too close.

702
01:32:26,478 --> 01:32:29,690
我们需要我们的船和我们的人去抓格鲁达。
We'll need our ship and our lads to catch Gruda.

703
01:32:35,238 --> 01:32:37,742
他们要把我们炸飞!快逃命!
They're going to blow us up! Jump for your lives!

704
01:33:11,824 --> 01:33:14,118
-是我们自己的船长!-我们知道你会来。
- It's our own skipper! - We knew you'd come.

705
01:33:14,159 --> 01:33:16,287
让我们离开这艘船。
Get us off this ship.

706
01:33:16,328 --> 01:33:19,040
-把绳子割断。-带我们离开这里!
- Cut the rope down. - Get us out of here!

707
01:33:35,685 --> 01:33:38,730
把所有的帆布都带上，你们这些童话般的海蛇!
Pack out all canvas, you fairy-tale sea snakes!

708
01:33:38,813 --> 01:33:40,190
去找他们!
Go get 'em!

709
01:33:45,530 --> 01:33:46,781
移动它们!
Move them!

710
01:33:47,032 --> 01:33:47,991
动!
Move!

711
01:34:17,568 --> 01:34:20,696
我真的觉得他打算和我们开战。
I really think he plans to do battle with us.

712
01:34:23,492 --> 01:34:26,286
瓦洛船长不仅失去了理智，还失去了心脏。
Captain Vallo's lost his head as well as his heart.

713
01:34:40,971 --> 01:34:42,264
拉臂。
Haul that jib.

714
01:34:45,309 --> 01:34:47,228
修剪顶端的绞架。
Trim those top gallows.

715
01:34:48,021 --> 01:34:49,564
两个点右舷。
Two points starboard.

716
01:35:02,079 --> 01:35:04,165
不要开火，以备舷侧攻击。
Hold your fire for a broadside.

717
01:35:04,248 --> 01:35:06,376
我们要火吗?
Shall we fire?

718
01:35:06,459 --> 01:35:10,089
有那个女孩在船上就不能开火。我们要让她寄宿。
There'll be no firing with the girl on the ship. We're going to board her.

719
01:35:19,307 --> 01:35:21,434
你们都到甲板下面去。
Below decks, the lot of you.

720
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:23,062
在双。
On the double.

721
01:35:30,946 --> 01:35:32,698
未来,波纹管先生?
Coming, Mr. Bellows?

722
01:35:34,617 --> 01:35:37,287
那些傻瓜要和我们交换武器。
The fools are going to trade broadsides with us.

723
01:35:44,670 --> 01:35:46,006
在你去。
In you go.

724
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:52,597
没有人掌舵，我们无法靠边。
With nobody at the wheel to steer, we'll not get alongside.

725
01:35:52,680 --> 01:35:55,517
现在担心已经来不及了。我们只能碰碰运气了。
Too late to worry about it. We'll have to take our chances.

726
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:57,645
你们的愿望。我们就去。
As ye wish. We'll go.

727
01:36:04,653 --> 01:36:06,530
我诚挚的歉意。
My humble apologies.

728
01:36:06,572 --> 01:36:09,784
但如果我不能像海盗一样活着，我也会像海盗一样死去。
But if I can't live like a pirate, I'll die like one.

729
01:36:09,868 --> 01:36:12,704
我会站在船边，把船开过来。
I'll stand by the wheel and bring her alongside.

730
01:36:12,745 --> 01:36:15,206
队长!给他们点颜色看看!
Skipper! Do them the dirty!

731
01:37:06,184 --> 01:37:07,810
准备开火!
Stand by to fire!

732
01:37:17,948 --> 01:37:18,865
开火!
Fire!

733
01:41:11,557 --> 01:41:13,560
我们迷路了!女孩!
We're lost! Get the girl!

734
01:43:41,401 --> 01:43:43,737
等等，教授!我们赢了!
Hold it, Professor! We've won!

735
01:43:43,987 --> 01:43:45,864
扔掉那些东西。
Get rid of that stuff.
