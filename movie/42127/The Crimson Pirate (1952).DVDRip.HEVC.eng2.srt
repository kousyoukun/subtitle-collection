1
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:19,900
Man the yards! Quick on all canvas!

2
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,891
Gather round, lads and lasses.
Gather round.

3
00:00:25,054 --> 00:00:28,422
You've been shanghaied aboard
for the last cruise of the Crimson Pirate...

4
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:31,140
a long, long time ago
in the far, far Caribbean.

5
00:00:31,262 --> 00:00:34,914
Remember, in a pirate ship,
in pirate waters, in a pirate world...

6
00:00:35,401 --> 00:00:38,038
ask no questions.
Believe only what you see.

7
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:47,210
No. Believe half of what you see.

8
00:00:49,035 --> 00:00:51,592
Man the capstan! Up anchor!

9
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:53,945
Move, you lubbers!

10
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:20,743
Ship to starboard!

11
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:34,135
Attention!

12
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,702
A scurvy ship, Your Excellency.

13
00:02:49,392 --> 00:02:53,207
You can tell by the position of the limbs.
Scurvy's killed the whole crew.

14
00:02:58,035 --> 00:03:00,592
A trim little ship, Captain Rodríguez.

15
00:03:00,957 --> 00:03:03,920
We'll take her in tow.
She'll bring a tidy sum.

16
00:03:04,731 --> 00:03:08,140
Put an officer and two men aboard her,
and have her in tow by nightfall.

17
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:09,438
Aye, aye, sir.

18
00:04:07,466 --> 00:04:10,591
- Only evil can come from a death ship.
- Aye.

19
00:04:11,281 --> 00:04:13,228
Sanctus, one of them touched me!

20
00:04:14,365 --> 00:04:16,312
What happened to those two?

21
00:04:17,043 --> 00:04:18,260
Follow me.

22
00:04:53,117 --> 00:04:55,470
My humble apologies.

23
00:06:53,059 --> 00:06:53,993
Bored?

24
00:06:54,033 --> 00:06:57,523
lf only there was something
to break the monotony of this voyage.

25
00:06:58,659 --> 00:07:00,405
Hands aloft, please.

26
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:10,103
You're the prisoners of Captain Vallo
and his scurvy crew.

27
00:07:27,186 --> 00:07:29,256
You may be overconfident, Captain Vallo.

28
00:07:29,337 --> 00:07:31,893
Two hundred of the King's marines
are aboard this vessel.

29
00:07:31,975 --> 00:07:34,938
And only 20 pirates.
That puts the odds slightly in my favor.

30
00:07:35,018 --> 00:07:37,802
- Better surrender the ship.
- l am merely a passenger.

31
00:07:37,951 --> 00:07:39,878
- Who is he?
- Baron Gruda.

32
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:42,809
Special envoy to His Majesty.

33
00:07:44,473 --> 00:07:46,391
Well, this is a pleasure.

34
00:07:46,698 --> 00:07:50,885
- You hanged most of my friends.
- For murdering most of mine.

35
00:07:54,043 --> 00:07:56,639
Seems you have
only 199 marines now, Baron.

36
00:07:58,262 --> 00:08:01,550
198. Better persuade the Captain
to surrender.

37
00:08:01,671 --> 00:08:03,376
The Captain is not the type to...

38
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:06,582
197.

39
00:08:06,622 --> 00:08:09,665
However, if you'll permit me
to speak to him...

40
00:08:13,196 --> 00:08:15,225
Ojo, pass the word for the Captain.

41
00:08:21,717 --> 00:08:24,355
Bring down the Captain!

42
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:27,277
Send down the Captain!

43
00:08:27,804 --> 00:08:29,752
Save the Captain!

44
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,781
Send down the Captain!

45
00:08:35,717 --> 00:08:37,908
Did you ask for the Captain, sir?

46
00:08:37,989 --> 00:08:40,829
Aye. Pay him my compliments
and show him in.

47
00:09:08,642 --> 00:09:10,590
Gather round, lads. Gather round.

48
00:09:15,094 --> 00:09:16,133
We're in luck.

49
00:09:16,213 --> 00:09:18,972
All hands will soon be digging into
a fat divvy.

50
00:09:20,292 --> 00:09:23,410
We're heading for the biggest
and the best pirate days ever.

51
00:09:23,489 --> 00:09:26,247
And here's the rich tally in round numbers.

52
00:09:27,248 --> 00:09:28,847
"Muskets: 3,000.

53
00:09:29,567 --> 00:09:31,485
"Powder kegs: 1,500.

54
00:09:32,124 --> 00:09:35,003
"Rounds of musket shot: 65,000.

55
00:09:35,723 --> 00:09:39,281
- "Rounds of cannon shot..."
- Begging thy pardon for interrupting...

56
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,760
but when will thee get into the gold?

57
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:46,676
Listen, fellows, listen.

58
00:09:46,757 --> 00:09:50,315
There are islands in these waters
steaming with rebellion against the King...

59
00:09:50,354 --> 00:09:53,314
and kept from boiling over
only for lack of guns.

60
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:56,032
lslands where guns
are worth more than gold.

61
00:09:56,111 --> 00:09:58,311
- More than diamonds.
- Gunrunning?

62
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:01,429
But that's not piracy, Skipper.
That's business.

63
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:05,068
- That means working ashore.
- We're doing poorly enough afloat.

64
00:10:05,587 --> 00:10:08,904
lf we're going to try this new caper,
let's make it a good one.

65
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:13,703
This cargo will bring 50,000 gold florin
from any rebels worth the name.

66
00:10:13,743 --> 00:10:17,061
- 50,000 florin?
- That's a pretty good take.

67
00:10:17,101 --> 00:10:19,339
Let's put it to the vote. All those in favor...

68
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:22,058
lf you'll forgive my interrupting, Skipper...

69
00:10:22,137 --> 00:10:24,616
l'd like to think before l vote.

70
00:10:24,976 --> 00:10:28,135
Meantime, we got
regular pirate business to settle.

71
00:10:28,974 --> 00:10:31,812
We got the plank, the culprit,
and the verdict.

72
00:10:31,892 --> 00:10:35,411
All we need's a trial
and execution of a sentence.

73
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:36,650
He's guilty!

74
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,689
So much for the trial. Now for execution.

75
00:10:40,687 --> 00:10:42,566
Come on. Kill me, you fools.

76
00:10:42,647 --> 00:10:46,884
The King's Navy will scour the Seven Seas
till every one of you is hung high and dry.

77
00:10:46,964 --> 00:10:49,723
- To the plank with him!
- Avast!

78
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:59,438
There'll be no plank-walking for him.

79
00:10:59,518 --> 00:11:01,837
Forgive my slow-wittedness, Skipper...

80
00:11:01,877 --> 00:11:05,674
but are thee asking us to spare
this sweet-smelling toad?

81
00:11:06,273 --> 00:11:08,512
Begging Thy Excellency's pardon.

82
00:11:08,593 --> 00:11:11,631
Your captain's got more brains
than all of you put together.

83
00:11:11,711 --> 00:11:13,790
No doubt you intend
to hold me for ransom.

84
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:17,228
No, my fine-feathered friend.
l'm setting you free.

85
00:11:18,188 --> 00:11:21,705
l say, if there's no profit in the monkey
we'll have our pleasure.

86
00:11:21,785 --> 00:11:23,785
l say there is profit in him. Alive.

87
00:11:23,864 --> 00:11:26,103
- How much profit?
- Now hear me out.

88
00:11:28,382 --> 00:11:31,500
l said 50,000 gold florin
from the rebels for the guns...

89
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:35,539
and here, by special commission,
is the King's chief rebel-catcher.

90
00:11:36,098 --> 00:11:38,775
So why not another 50,000
from him and his king...

91
00:11:38,856 --> 00:11:41,495
for telling them which rebels
we sell all the guns to.

92
00:11:41,574 --> 00:11:42,654
Eh, Baron?

93
00:11:42,734 --> 00:11:45,373
A brilliant scheme, Captain.
My congratulations.

94
00:11:45,453 --> 00:11:47,132
Thy congratulations.

95
00:11:47,892 --> 00:11:51,210
lf thou art for it,
it is not for the good of pirates.

96
00:11:51,249 --> 00:11:53,167
Good? Gentlemen, it's magnificent.

97
00:11:53,248 --> 00:11:57,767
l'm bound for the lsland of Cobra to catch
a man, El Libre, and smash his rebellion.

98
00:11:58,006 --> 00:12:01,924
lf you'll take the guns there, lure him
out of his hole and into my hands...

99
00:12:02,003 --> 00:12:04,442
l'll raise the purse another 50,000.

100
00:12:05,322 --> 00:12:09,239
There it is, lads, in round figures:
150,000 florin.

101
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,996
What do you say now,
Mr. Humble Bellows?

102
00:12:15,556 --> 00:12:18,235
Thy humble servant will believe it...

103
00:12:18,315 --> 00:12:20,514
when thy humble servant sees it.

104
00:12:21,313 --> 00:12:23,591
l take it we have a deal, Captain.

105
00:12:54,216 --> 00:12:57,014
This change of ship, Captain,
most uncomfortable.

106
00:12:57,133 --> 00:13:00,252
My men won't transfer cargo.
Too much like honest work.

107
00:13:00,331 --> 00:13:03,650
Captain Vallo, your men have only left me
headsail and topsail.

108
00:13:03,731 --> 00:13:06,289
They're enough to get you to Cobra
sooner or later.

109
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:08,447
My ship is faster than this barge.

110
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:12,005
l don't want you making port
before l've got El Libre ready for delivery...

111
00:13:12,086 --> 00:13:14,044
or putting a shot in my backside.

112
00:13:14,124 --> 00:13:17,443
l hope El Libre is not as careful
as you are, Captain.

113
00:13:28,677 --> 00:13:30,595
Cast off helm!

114
00:13:32,434 --> 00:13:34,513
Cast off stern!

115
00:13:36,473 --> 00:13:40,431
- Mr. Bellows, make sail!
- Aye, aye, sir!

116
00:14:04,617 --> 00:14:06,336
Haul up, full and by.

117
00:14:06,776 --> 00:14:10,174
Nor' nor' east.
We're heading for the lsle of Cobra.

118
00:14:10,734 --> 00:14:12,732
Come on, you lubbers, move!

119
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:50,312
Hear ye, hear ye!

120
00:14:50,551 --> 00:14:53,590
The King's vessel is now at anchor...

121
00:14:53,671 --> 00:14:56,989
in the port of Cobra
with Baron Gruda aboard.

122
00:14:57,069 --> 00:15:01,665
Any demonstration
will be regarded as high treason.

123
00:15:03,465 --> 00:15:05,503
The people seem very quiet, don't they?

124
00:15:05,584 --> 00:15:08,982
l don't think they intend to demonstrate
against Baron Gruda after all.

125
00:15:09,062 --> 00:15:11,622
- Apparently not, Governor.
- What a pity.

126
00:15:11,701 --> 00:15:14,179
Our troops could've cut them down
like wheat.

127
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:16,898
Couldn't we shoot a few
on general principles?

128
00:15:16,937 --> 00:15:18,297
Might impress the Baron.

129
00:15:18,337 --> 00:15:20,615
He might feel
you are merely provoking trouble.

130
00:15:20,696 --> 00:15:23,815
Most exasperating.
Fire the salute to Baron Gruda.

131
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:27,772
Attention!

132
00:15:39,845 --> 00:15:43,883
Give the word and l'll dose
those backstabbers with a broadside.

133
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:46,443
They're not firing at us,
you powder-brained ape.

134
00:15:46,523 --> 00:15:50,559
They're giving us a 15-gun salute.
We're flying the flag of Gruda.

135
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,678
Slimey, bring out the flags
and run up that message l gave you.

136
00:15:54,478 --> 00:15:56,997
And, Slimey,
give the Governor my compliments.

137
00:15:57,076 --> 00:15:58,555
The Crimson Pirate's?

138
00:15:58,635 --> 00:16:00,994
No, you oyster-head, Baron Gruda's.

139
00:16:01,713 --> 00:16:05,192
Mr. Bellows, keep the rest of these
half-masted monkeys below deck.

140
00:16:05,272 --> 00:16:06,511
Aye, aye, Skipper.

141
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:09,509
Keep a sharp lookout, lads.
l'll be back with El Libre tonight.

142
00:16:09,589 --> 00:16:11,028
Let's go, Ojo.

143
00:16:17,986 --> 00:16:22,102
There goes a good pirate,
to sell his wares like a fish peddler.

144
00:16:22,622 --> 00:16:24,981
Meaning no disrespect to the Skipper,
of course.

145
00:16:25,061 --> 00:16:26,780
Us with a price on our heads...

146
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:30,898
holed, too, in one of His Majesty's ports
like sitting ducks.

147
00:16:31,617 --> 00:16:35,855
But if the Skipper pulls us through again,
we'd be the ducks with the golden eggs.

148
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:39,254
You're thinking of geese,
if you'll pardon the correction, Poison Paul.

149
00:16:39,692 --> 00:16:42,451
Geese on a wild-goose chase.

150
00:16:53,326 --> 00:16:54,763
What do they say, Joseph?

151
00:16:54,804 --> 00:16:58,003
They've got the plague onboard,
and they're quarantining themselves...

152
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,042
until the victims are killed or cured.

153
00:17:01,401 --> 00:17:04,079
We must signal my profound condolences
to Baron Gruda.

154
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,918
- Very well, Governor.
- Maybe it's all for the best, Joseph.

155
00:17:06,957 --> 00:17:09,237
El Libre's followers
may yet show their hands...

156
00:17:09,316 --> 00:17:11,996
and give me a chance to impress
the Baron. Order my carriage.

157
00:17:12,315 --> 00:17:16,234
Disperse the crowd. Change the guard,
and double your patrols in the street.

158
00:17:17,472 --> 00:17:19,311
Come on, my popsy-wopsy-wopsies.

159
00:17:29,785 --> 00:17:33,663
Plague, is it? May it take all of them.
Baron Gruda first.

160
00:17:34,103 --> 00:17:36,622
Aye, and if the plague don't, we will.

161
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:41,579
- Who are you?
- Simple fisher folk like yourselves.

162
00:17:41,659 --> 00:17:45,497
Put in for a tankard of ale, a friendly word,
and a chance to fight the King.

163
00:17:48,296 --> 00:17:49,696
Why choose us?

164
00:17:54,292 --> 00:17:56,012
You look and talk like a fighter.

165
00:17:56,491 --> 00:17:57,850
lt takes one to know one.

166
00:17:57,931 --> 00:18:00,529
You may have us marked, all right.
Maybe not.

167
00:18:00,609 --> 00:18:02,488
But we haven't marked you yet.

168
00:18:02,569 --> 00:18:04,927
- We're asking no questions.
- We are.

169
00:18:05,805 --> 00:18:08,284
What l've heard about El Libre
is good enough for me.

170
00:18:08,365 --> 00:18:09,844
Tell us how to contact him.

171
00:18:09,924 --> 00:18:13,322
A man like him would be pleased to have
two more strong-armed lads aboard.

172
00:18:20,318 --> 00:18:22,237
Not very trusting souls, are they?

173
00:18:33,471 --> 00:18:36,591
l guess we'll have to prove
our high regard for El Libre.

174
00:18:48,943 --> 00:18:51,461
Ojo, you took the words
right out of my mouth.

175
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:53,741
A brawl with the King's men. Let's go.

176
00:18:59,018 --> 00:19:02,776
Left, right. Left. Mark time!

177
00:19:05,574 --> 00:19:06,893
Right turn.

178
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:09,812
Halt!

179
00:19:12,091 --> 00:19:15,809
Quick march! Forward! Halt! Turn!

180
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:26,562
Right wheel!

181
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,518
March!

182
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:36,797
Halt!

183
00:19:38,676 --> 00:19:40,395
Present arms!

184
00:20:09,698 --> 00:20:11,138
Long live the republic!

185
00:20:11,218 --> 00:20:13,017
Rebels! Get them!

186
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:29,169
Long live El Libre!

187
00:20:29,209 --> 00:20:30,567
After them!

188
00:21:11,385 --> 00:21:12,585
There they are!

189
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,464
Don't let them get away!

190
00:21:42,209 --> 00:21:44,088
Men! Come on!

191
00:22:50,053 --> 00:22:51,811
Come on! Quick, in that corner.

192
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:54,410
There they go!

193
00:23:05,844 --> 00:23:07,483
Hurry up. ln back.

194
00:23:10,081 --> 00:23:11,321
This way!

195
00:23:15,798 --> 00:23:16,717
Go ahead.

196
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:25,952
Pierce the canvas.

197
00:23:39,225 --> 00:23:40,265
Fire!

198
00:23:47,501 --> 00:23:48,581
Ready? Fire!

199
00:23:58,974 --> 00:24:01,813
Pick it up! Lift it up!
Come on. Lift it up! Fire!

200
00:24:05,971 --> 00:24:07,130
Take us away.

201
00:24:09,409 --> 00:24:11,128
They're getting away!

202
00:24:28,638 --> 00:24:31,077
Latch the cellars! Block the alley!

203
00:24:46,229 --> 00:24:47,349
Look out. Soldiers.

204
00:24:53,265 --> 00:24:54,424
Just a minute.

205
00:25:04,259 --> 00:25:05,538
Search the place.

206
00:26:02,508 --> 00:26:05,346
- The stink would drive away a pig.
- Which it did.

207
00:26:06,825 --> 00:26:08,465
Watch that door.

208
00:26:14,621 --> 00:26:16,660
You've saved us, lad, you've saved us.

209
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,499
We're among our own kind.

210
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:20,978
Rebels.

211
00:26:21,258 --> 00:26:23,616
Wouldn't surprise me
if you were El Libre himself.

212
00:26:23,856 --> 00:26:27,174
- You look like a born leader of men.
- The name's Pablo Murphy.

213
00:26:27,254 --> 00:26:30,893
And l got enough lrish from me father
to know blarney when l hear it.

214
00:26:31,013 --> 00:26:33,690
We'd have slit your throats
for snooping spies by now...

215
00:26:33,771 --> 00:26:35,529
only for what you did to them soldiers.

216
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:37,608
- Who are they?
- Who knows?

217
00:26:37,649 --> 00:26:40,047
This one can't talk
and this one can't keep quiet.

218
00:26:40,127 --> 00:26:43,407
All right, let's get to the point.
l'm Captain Vallo at your service.

219
00:26:43,486 --> 00:26:45,124
And this is Lieutenant Ojo.

220
00:26:48,243 --> 00:26:50,401
Vallo? The pirate?

221
00:26:50,482 --> 00:26:52,001
The Crimson Pirate?

222
00:26:52,042 --> 00:26:55,040
That's right, sweet mother,
with a bargain for El Libre...

223
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:57,157
a shipload of powder shot and musketry.

224
00:26:57,238 --> 00:26:59,516
- Baron Gruda's ship.
- Baron Gruda's ship?

225
00:26:59,596 --> 00:27:01,915
Aye. Baron Gruda's own 30-gunner.

226
00:27:02,436 --> 00:27:05,274
We took her as easy as you'd take
a mackerel, fine fishermen.

227
00:27:05,353 --> 00:27:07,512
Easier. For we used dead bait.

228
00:27:08,032 --> 00:27:09,951
You killed Baron Gruda?

229
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:14,028
lf l did that you wouldn't need the guns
l want to sell you.

230
00:27:14,109 --> 00:27:16,348
l'm a pirate, not a dog killer.

231
00:27:16,429 --> 00:27:18,826
But l like you lads. l like your style.

232
00:27:18,907 --> 00:27:20,745
So gather round and get this:

233
00:27:20,825 --> 00:27:24,583
The Baron will arrive in port
aboard my own ship in a matter of days.

234
00:27:24,664 --> 00:27:28,422
So how about taking me to El Libre
so we can close the deal for the guns?

235
00:27:28,501 --> 00:27:30,299
Time and tide, you know.

236
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:52,249
Wash the stink off them
and take them below.

237
00:27:52,328 --> 00:27:53,647
Pass the word along.

238
00:28:14,157 --> 00:28:17,035
When it's dark,
we'll take them to the small boat...

239
00:28:17,114 --> 00:28:19,233
and row them out to their ship.
Come with me.

240
00:28:31,667 --> 00:28:33,307
Now, you know what the plan is.

241
00:28:33,385 --> 00:28:35,625
The rest will join my lads
at the fishing boats...

242
00:28:35,705 --> 00:28:38,183
and stand by the pirate vessel
to receive the guns.

243
00:28:38,263 --> 00:28:40,342
Suppose the pirates
refuse to give them up?

244
00:28:40,421 --> 00:28:43,100
l'll keep my knife at Captain Vallo's throat.

245
00:28:43,181 --> 00:28:45,820
Either he'll give the order
to hand over the guns...

246
00:28:45,899 --> 00:28:47,938
or he'll never give another order.

247
00:28:47,978 --> 00:28:51,055
You're cutting our throats,
Pablo Murphy, not his.

248
00:28:54,494 --> 00:28:56,973
l like your nerve, Pablo, but not your plan.

249
00:28:57,054 --> 00:29:01,011
l say we've got to get the guns and take
the palace before Baron Gruda gets here.

250
00:29:01,091 --> 00:29:04,569
And l say we need more than guns.
We need El Libre to lead us.

251
00:29:04,648 --> 00:29:07,327
You women won't face facts.
El Libre's been captured.

252
00:29:07,407 --> 00:29:09,247
The way to face facts is to rescue him.

253
00:29:09,286 --> 00:29:11,765
Rescue him?
From the King's prison? lmpossible.

254
00:29:13,404 --> 00:29:17,362
Not for a desperate man
with a 30-gunner and a fighting crew.

255
00:29:17,882 --> 00:29:20,000
A pirate rescue for El Libre?

256
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:23,519
That'd be taking him from the frying pan
and throwing him into the fire.

257
00:29:23,598 --> 00:29:25,957
- We'll handle this our own way.
- About face!

258
00:29:26,037 --> 00:29:27,116
Get over here.

259
00:30:08,094 --> 00:30:09,813
There's a meeting! The door, quick!

260
00:30:25,725 --> 00:30:27,125
Out! The other door!

261
00:30:47,473 --> 00:30:49,952
lf l release you, can l count on your help?

262
00:30:51,591 --> 00:30:53,151
You'll be well paid.

263
00:31:10,661 --> 00:31:12,460
You misjudged our men.

264
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,659
Don't misjudge our women.

265
00:31:16,097 --> 00:31:17,656
- Another door here.
- Where?

266
00:31:17,736 --> 00:31:19,056
Follow me.

267
00:32:01,633 --> 00:32:05,031
- What's all the shooting?
- The Skipper coming back from market.

268
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:07,750
l have a feeling we'll be putting out to sea.

269
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:11,508
Hoist anchor. Man all canvas. Look lively!

270
00:32:11,668 --> 00:32:13,547
Man the yards!

271
00:32:17,944 --> 00:32:19,183
Prepare to fire!

272
00:32:24,182 --> 00:32:25,420
Fire one!

273
00:32:34,135 --> 00:32:35,375
Fire two!

274
00:32:49,967 --> 00:32:54,404
Signal Baron Gruda's ship for a broadside.
One of us can knock her out of the water.

275
00:33:14,794 --> 00:33:18,192
Shore battery's asking for a broadside
against them, Mr. Bellows.

276
00:33:18,271 --> 00:33:20,671
What are you waiting for, drooling idiot?

277
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:24,068
- Give 'em a broadside!
- Aye, aye, sir! One broadside coming up!

278
00:33:42,218 --> 00:33:44,138
Good shooting, lads. Well aimed.

279
00:33:44,616 --> 00:33:47,055
Skipper, be that
what thou bought at market?

280
00:33:48,775 --> 00:33:50,974
Take the lady below
and make her comfortable.

281
00:33:54,572 --> 00:33:56,250
Thank you, Captain.

282
00:33:58,969 --> 00:34:00,968
The gallant Captain Vallo, eh, lads?

283
00:34:06,446 --> 00:34:08,563
Be that bit of fluff El Libre?

284
00:34:08,644 --> 00:34:10,762
That's the bit of fluff
that's taking us to him.

285
00:34:10,843 --> 00:34:14,801
He's being held on the lsland of San Perot,
only a day's sailing from here.

286
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,159
Who's holding him for us, Skipper?

287
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:22,637
The King's troop. ln the military prison.
Now, what could be sweeter, lads?

288
00:34:22,676 --> 00:34:26,354
We'll steal him from the King's men,
and sell him back to a king's man.

289
00:34:27,434 --> 00:34:31,111
- But be thou seriously planning to...
- Walk us into a king's prison?

290
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:33,990
Why, not at all, Humble Bellows, not at all.

291
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:36,469
Gather round, lads, gather round!

292
00:35:21,405 --> 00:35:25,802
- My, my, what a pretty knife.
- Would you like a closer look?

293
00:35:26,002 --> 00:35:28,441
Let's keep this pot
looking like a ship of the line!

294
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,480
Come up here.

295
00:35:35,637 --> 00:35:36,837
Hop to it!

296
00:35:44,792 --> 00:35:47,031
l came up to talk about El Libre.

297
00:35:51,948 --> 00:35:54,946
- Go ahead. l'm listening.
- You have a plan to save him?

298
00:35:55,546 --> 00:35:58,544
A plan and a price.
Guns alone will cost 50,000.

299
00:35:58,624 --> 00:36:02,342
That's a great deal of money for guns.
How much are you asking for El Libre?

300
00:36:03,342 --> 00:36:04,941
Oh, yes, El Libre.

301
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,220
l'll throw him in for nothing.

302
00:36:08,658 --> 00:36:10,099
Very well, Captain.

303
00:36:10,179 --> 00:36:12,536
l'll see that the money
is arranged with him.

304
00:36:12,616 --> 00:36:15,015
You may be sure
that he'll honor the agreement.

305
00:36:15,894 --> 00:36:17,255
What's your plan?

306
00:36:21,773 --> 00:36:23,930
Why did you bolt
your cabin door last night?

307
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:26,809
lf you know it was bolted,
you must've tried it.

308
00:36:26,929 --> 00:36:29,328
And if you tried it,
you know why it was bolted.

309
00:36:32,246 --> 00:36:34,206
How do you propose to get El Libre?

310
00:36:34,765 --> 00:36:36,643
ls your door open only to him?

311
00:36:37,923 --> 00:36:39,043
What do you mean?

312
00:36:39,122 --> 00:36:42,601
So much concern about one man
can't be entirely political.

313
00:36:43,121 --> 00:36:44,640
He's your lover.

314
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:46,158
No.

315
00:36:46,878 --> 00:36:48,358
He's my father.

316
00:36:50,076 --> 00:36:51,315
Captain!

317
00:36:55,673 --> 00:36:57,073
Land ho!

318
00:37:12,784 --> 00:37:15,143
On your feet, lads. Attention!

319
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:23,138
You're supposed to be king's men,
not bard slabs.

320
00:37:23,338 --> 00:37:25,417
Look like you belong in those uniforms.

321
00:37:37,771 --> 00:37:40,850
Ojo, signal to the garrison
that Baron Gruda has arrived...

322
00:37:41,209 --> 00:37:42,847
to take El Libre into custody.

323
00:37:54,961 --> 00:37:57,840
- What about my father?
- l ordered you to stay below.

324
00:38:00,158 --> 00:38:02,037
What are they signaling?

325
00:38:03,877 --> 00:38:07,234
The garrison commander wishes
to give a dinner in honor of Baron Gruda.

326
00:38:08,154 --> 00:38:10,033
What are we going to do?

327
00:38:11,232 --> 00:38:13,551
We're going to accept, of course.

328
00:38:49,812 --> 00:38:51,611
Baron Gruda and his bit of fluff...

329
00:38:51,649 --> 00:38:54,728
left enough clothes onboard
to fool the King himself.

330
00:38:54,808 --> 00:38:56,327
lf anyone recognizes us...

331
00:38:56,408 --> 00:38:59,446
we'll be stripping for action
and taking El Libre the hard way.

332
00:39:06,963 --> 00:39:09,920
A fine body of men, Captain.
A fine body of men.

333
00:39:42,103 --> 00:39:45,942
His Excellency Baron Gruda and party.

334
00:40:01,972 --> 00:40:03,731
Welcome, Your Excellency.

335
00:40:03,812 --> 00:40:07,130
lt is a great honor for all of us
to meet you at last.

336
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:10,088
lt gives us great pleasure
that you accept our hospitality.

337
00:40:10,169 --> 00:40:12,886
On the contrary, my dear Colonel,
it is l who am accepted.

338
00:40:12,966 --> 00:40:15,765
Oh, no, Your Excellency.
l am the lucky one.

339
00:40:16,564 --> 00:40:20,842
l had instructions from the Governor
of Cobra to execute El Libre.

340
00:40:21,562 --> 00:40:24,480
l was on the verge of doing so
when l got your message.

341
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,319
The Governor is an idiot!
l may replace him...

342
00:40:28,558 --> 00:40:29,837
with a military man.

343
00:40:30,557 --> 00:40:33,435
- My dear Baron.
- My dear Colonel.

344
00:40:38,792 --> 00:40:41,870
- May l introduce you to our guests?
- By all means.

345
00:40:52,545 --> 00:40:54,904
- Your Excellency.
- Your Excellency.

346
00:41:20,809 --> 00:41:24,127
But l have so much trouble
collecting the King's taxes here.

347
00:41:24,207 --> 00:41:27,126
Tell me, Count.
How do the people pay at home?

348
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:33,043
Through the nose!
They pay through the nose!

349
00:41:34,682 --> 00:41:36,441
That's really very good!

350
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,597
How long do we have to play this game?

351
00:41:44,516 --> 00:41:46,995
Till the Colonel decides
to hand over El Libre.

352
00:41:47,076 --> 00:41:48,595
l am frightened.

353
00:42:12,262 --> 00:42:14,381
The Count must be
a constant delight to you.

354
00:42:14,421 --> 00:42:16,618
He's really too funny for words.

355
00:42:16,699 --> 00:42:17,858
lndeed he is.

356
00:42:17,938 --> 00:42:19,218
Do tell us, Count.

357
00:42:19,298 --> 00:42:22,536
What does the Queen wear
when she goes out these days?

358
00:42:24,655 --> 00:42:27,533
The Count always says
the Queen wears the King out.

359
00:42:27,893 --> 00:42:29,732
You are the wittiest man!

360
00:42:32,811 --> 00:42:36,329
Ladies and gentlemen,
may l have your attention, please.

361
00:42:37,569 --> 00:42:41,405
To commemorate the honor
Baron Gruda has done us by his visit...

362
00:42:41,886 --> 00:42:46,363
the officers of the Saint Theo garrison
have arranged a little gift for him.

363
00:42:47,562 --> 00:42:50,040
Will everyone come this way, please?

364
00:43:04,114 --> 00:43:05,193
On the left...

365
00:43:05,273 --> 00:43:09,711
you have that great lover of democracy
and the people, El Libre.

366
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:13,228
And on the right,
that distinguished scientist...

367
00:43:13,309 --> 00:43:15,267
Professor Prudence.

368
00:43:15,907 --> 00:43:18,226
Both caught like rats in a trap...

369
00:43:18,425 --> 00:43:22,464
conspiring against the greater glory
of His Majesty.

370
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:26,342
But thanks to statesmen
like Baron Gruda...

371
00:43:26,861 --> 00:43:31,179
such men and such ideas
will soon be destroyed.

372
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:33,739
As a distinguished scientist...

373
00:43:33,818 --> 00:43:38,096
l can assure you an idea has no physical
properties which can be destroyed.

374
00:43:38,174 --> 00:43:40,974
As a lover of democracy and the people,
l can assure you...

375
00:43:41,053 --> 00:43:43,333
both will survive your puny efforts.

376
00:43:44,573 --> 00:43:48,009
As a statesman, l can assure you
that no one can foretell the future.

377
00:43:48,089 --> 00:43:51,488
However, your fate at present
is as clear to me...

378
00:43:52,088 --> 00:43:54,567
as the face of this beautiful lady
at my side.

379
00:43:54,646 --> 00:43:56,005
Bravo!

380
00:43:56,086 --> 00:43:58,684
Thank you, Your Excellency.

381
00:44:03,082 --> 00:44:05,960
Yes. She is very beautiful.

382
00:44:07,439 --> 00:44:09,198
His Excellency has a point.

383
00:44:09,278 --> 00:44:13,156
lt's foolish to quarrel with fate
when ours is so clearly in his hands.

384
00:44:14,675 --> 00:44:18,514
Take them outside and hold them
for Baron Gruda's pleasure.

385
00:44:23,151 --> 00:44:26,510
My dear Colonel, thank you
for a most rewarding evening.

386
00:44:26,588 --> 00:44:29,467
- And now we must go.
- lt is by no means over.

387
00:44:29,547 --> 00:44:32,145
l've arranged
a very special entertainment...

388
00:44:32,225 --> 00:44:34,224
for this very special occasion.

389
00:44:55,892 --> 00:44:57,972
lt's that dame we held for ransom.

390
00:45:08,526 --> 00:45:09,605
Abandon ship.

391
00:45:09,686 --> 00:45:12,564
- Thank you, my dear Colonel.
- Your Excellency!

392
00:45:13,084 --> 00:45:16,523
- But, my dear Baron!
- Wonderful evening, Colonel.

393
00:45:16,601 --> 00:45:17,680
Vallo!

394
00:45:23,558 --> 00:45:24,717
But, Your Excellency.

395
00:45:24,797 --> 00:45:28,354
Unexpected international affairs.
Happens to us diplomats all the time.

396
00:45:32,433 --> 00:45:34,792
- Put the prisoners in my carriage.
- Aye, aye, sir.

397
00:45:42,148 --> 00:45:45,146
l do hope the King will hear about this,
Your Excellency.

398
00:45:45,226 --> 00:45:46,545
Don't worry, he will.

399
00:45:47,985 --> 00:45:50,783
Unclutch me, you polluted shrimp.

400
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:55,221
Stop him, you fools!

401
00:45:55,621 --> 00:45:57,699
He's the Crimson Pirate!

402
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:59,419
The Crimson Pirate?

403
00:46:07,254 --> 00:46:09,893
The Crimson Pirate!

404
00:46:11,892 --> 00:46:13,810
Take the Colonel to safety. Quick, man.

405
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:18,888
- Take the Colonel to safety!
- Let me go, you fools!

406
00:46:20,047 --> 00:46:22,686
Don't worry, Colonel.
l'll take care of everything!

407
00:46:22,766 --> 00:46:25,723
- Citizen Ravel, save the Count!
- Save the Count!

408
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,837
- Sire! Sire!
- Good work, Captain.

409
00:46:37,118 --> 00:46:39,676
Stop him! There's the Crimson Pirate!

410
00:46:40,236 --> 00:46:41,436
Captain!

411
00:46:43,074 --> 00:46:45,234
The officers are mutinying. Crush them!

412
00:46:46,473 --> 00:46:48,151
Crush them! Come on!

413
00:46:49,711 --> 00:46:51,030
Sound the attack!

414
00:46:54,549 --> 00:46:57,587
Hold the fort. Don't give an inch.
Protect the women and children.

415
00:46:57,627 --> 00:47:00,505
Reinforcements are on the way.
Lock the gates! Let no one out.

416
00:47:00,545 --> 00:47:02,464
Lock the gates! Let no one out!

417
00:47:02,543 --> 00:47:05,702
Long live the King!

418
00:47:09,781 --> 00:47:12,299
l don't think we've met.
My name is Prudence.

419
00:47:12,379 --> 00:47:14,537
Captain Vallo, at your service.

420
00:47:16,577 --> 00:47:17,857
Thank you.

421
00:47:48,919 --> 00:47:50,798
What are you grinning at?

422
00:47:55,675 --> 00:47:58,634
So, l'm getting a halo.
You're afraid l'm getting soft.

423
00:47:59,473 --> 00:48:01,112
Yeah, you're wrong.

424
00:48:02,712 --> 00:48:06,709
lt's just that this is a new kind of caper.
These people are getting on my nerves.

425
00:48:07,308 --> 00:48:09,548
El Libre and his daughter
are strictly business.

426
00:48:11,147 --> 00:48:14,306
They haven't got me chained.
l've got them chained.

427
00:48:14,986 --> 00:48:17,024
l'll be rid of them soon enough.

428
00:48:17,105 --> 00:48:19,782
Tomorrow, l'm delivering them
to Baron Gruda personally.

429
00:48:21,021 --> 00:48:22,661
What are you talking about?

430
00:48:47,528 --> 00:48:48,767
The girl?

431
00:48:53,204 --> 00:48:54,484
What about the girl?

432
00:48:58,362 --> 00:49:00,001
She's getting under my skin.

433
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:03,079
She's putting crazy ideas in my head.

434
00:49:03,798 --> 00:49:07,796
She's unlocked my heart.
She's getting too close to me.

435
00:49:09,235 --> 00:49:10,635
She's got me hooked.

436
00:49:12,674 --> 00:49:13,993
She's blind.

437
00:49:15,152 --> 00:49:17,070
l'm blind. You're blind.

438
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:19,270
Who's blind?

439
00:49:22,469 --> 00:49:24,068
Oh! Love is blind.

440
00:49:25,867 --> 00:49:27,426
l am not in love!

441
00:50:12,481 --> 00:50:13,800
Avast there!

442
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,718
l told you not to make so much noise.
Now the Skipper will get her.

443
00:50:18,798 --> 00:50:20,797
- He always does.
- Nobody will get her.

444
00:50:27,792 --> 00:50:29,392
Untie the others. Move!

445
00:50:29,472 --> 00:50:31,191
What's up? l'm having a little fun.

446
00:50:31,271 --> 00:50:34,589
- Come on, Skipper. Let us have some fun.
- You want her all to yourself?

447
00:50:34,669 --> 00:50:37,748
- Why don't you join the fun?
- Why don't you try yourself?

448
00:50:37,827 --> 00:50:41,306
- You always tell that you couldn't make it.
- Always work and no fun.

449
00:50:53,899 --> 00:50:57,297
Mr. Bellows, take all three below
and bring me the cabin keys.

450
00:50:57,456 --> 00:50:59,935
lf you'll forgive
my pointing it out, Skipper...

451
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:03,214
we can't leave a pretty woman
unmolested aboard ship.

452
00:51:03,654 --> 00:51:05,853
lt will give piracy a bad name.

453
00:51:05,973 --> 00:51:07,732
Are you challenging my orders?

454
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:11,529
l'd never do that, Skipper...

455
00:51:11,769 --> 00:51:15,568
but seeing thou is selling these pigeons
to Baron Gruda anyway...

456
00:51:15,647 --> 00:51:19,285
l thought there could be no harm
to sport with them a bit first.

457
00:51:20,883 --> 00:51:22,563
No offense, Skipper.

458
00:51:36,915 --> 00:51:39,955
l'm putting you ashore tomorrow at Cobra
and giving you the guns.

459
00:51:40,993 --> 00:51:42,313
All of you.

460
00:51:43,952 --> 00:51:45,630
Just don't thank me.

461
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:24,250
Skipper.

462
00:52:32,965 --> 00:52:36,004
Yes, there's our ship.
With Baron Gruda waiting.

463
00:52:36,482 --> 00:52:38,322
Won't he hate paying for El Libre...

464
00:52:38,402 --> 00:52:41,961
when he finds out we stole him
out of one of the King's own prisons?

465
00:52:44,959 --> 00:52:48,597
- We'll heave to onto the point till nightfall.
- Aye, aye, Skipper.

466
00:52:53,394 --> 00:52:54,513
Slimey.

467
00:53:04,228 --> 00:53:08,305
- Let's see thee swim to yonder island.
- Aye, and back again.

468
00:53:08,786 --> 00:53:12,424
lf my plan works,
Baron Gruda himself will escort thee back.

469
00:53:12,864 --> 00:53:14,822
l've a message for thee to give to him.

470
00:53:15,222 --> 00:53:17,781
Do it, and when l am skipper...

471
00:53:17,981 --> 00:53:19,620
thou wilt be first mate.

472
00:53:22,939 --> 00:53:24,377
Mr. Bellows...

473
00:53:26,336 --> 00:53:29,334
- what about sharks?
- They never attack a man.

474
00:53:29,974 --> 00:53:32,093
Unless he attacks them first.

475
00:53:42,447 --> 00:53:44,126
- Governor.
- Baron?

476
00:53:44,806 --> 00:53:48,284
- Send him to the kitchen and feed him.
- Kitchen. Feed him.

477
00:53:51,362 --> 00:53:53,801
You'll have the 100,000 gold florin
ready for them.

478
00:53:53,841 --> 00:53:56,040
Whatever Your Excellency orders.

479
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:59,717
- But this is sheer piracy.
- l assure you...

480
00:53:59,837 --> 00:54:03,356
l shall have El Libre, his daughter,
his distinguished conspirator...

481
00:54:03,436 --> 00:54:07,634
our ship, our guns, the pirates,
and Captain Vallo, without paying a sou.

482
00:54:07,914 --> 00:54:10,951
- Then why 100,000?
- Have the money ready, l said.

483
00:54:12,751 --> 00:54:16,509
The first mate thinks he can undo Vallo,
but his plan may fail.

484
00:54:17,309 --> 00:54:20,747
Even if we have to pay, such a haul
would be cheap at double the price.

485
00:54:20,826 --> 00:54:22,225
By the way...

486
00:54:22,705 --> 00:54:25,824
l shall want a barrel of this, well drugged.

487
00:54:33,859 --> 00:54:35,859
- You disposed of Captain Vallo?
- No.

488
00:54:35,938 --> 00:54:38,897
lt will be necessary to expose him
to the crew first.

489
00:54:38,977 --> 00:54:42,815
Which l'll be doing soon enough,
if thou has followed my instructions.

490
00:54:42,895 --> 00:54:44,333
To the letter.

491
00:54:44,653 --> 00:54:47,411
And the money?
lf you'll forgive my impatience.

492
00:54:47,492 --> 00:54:49,571
lt will be waiting for you in the morning.

493
00:54:49,651 --> 00:54:52,769
Meanwhile, l place myself in your hands
as security for it.

494
00:54:52,850 --> 00:54:54,129
Very well.

495
00:54:54,209 --> 00:54:57,646
But l remind thee, they be murderous
hands when they're empty.

496
00:54:59,286 --> 00:55:01,205
Hide His Excellency below.

497
00:55:31,267 --> 00:55:35,067
As soon as it's clear topside,
Ojo will stand by below with a small boat.

498
00:55:35,106 --> 00:55:37,985
lt's a short pull to shore. Call your father.

499
00:56:10,207 --> 00:56:12,527
Come with us. Join us.

500
00:56:14,525 --> 00:56:15,484
No.

501
00:56:17,283 --> 00:56:20,042
But you want to. l know you want to.

502
00:56:21,162 --> 00:56:22,560
You're wrong.

503
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:26,278
There's nothing in it for me.
Get your father.

504
00:56:30,876 --> 00:56:32,835
Then why are you setting us free?

505
00:56:32,916 --> 00:56:36,153
- l keep my promises, even foolish ones.
- You made no promise.

506
00:56:36,234 --> 00:56:39,191
You made a deal to sell us,
and you can't do it.

507
00:56:39,511 --> 00:56:43,189
All right, then. l'm doing it for you.
Let's leave it at that.

508
00:56:44,149 --> 00:56:46,867
No, Vallo. We can't leave it at that.

509
00:56:47,588 --> 00:56:49,825
You're a fighter. Fight with us.

510
00:56:50,385 --> 00:56:52,703
- Fight for something decent.
- Not l.

511
00:56:53,264 --> 00:56:57,223
All my life l've watched injustice
and dishonesty fly the flag of decency.

512
00:56:57,262 --> 00:57:00,021
- l don't trust them.
- Don't you trust me?

513
00:57:02,938 --> 00:57:05,736
Don't you trust what we have
for each other?

514
00:57:05,858 --> 00:57:08,976
What we have for each other
we'll have to get over.

515
00:57:11,295 --> 00:57:12,452
Can we?

516
00:57:30,044 --> 00:57:32,322
You're right. l won't let you go.

517
00:57:33,282 --> 00:57:36,920
We belong together here,
aboard my ship. We'll find a way.

518
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:40,438
But that's not possible.

519
00:57:41,638 --> 00:57:45,595
- l can't stay here. Don't you see?
- Yes, l see.

520
00:57:46,955 --> 00:57:49,193
And now, at last, you see it, too.

521
00:57:50,033 --> 00:57:52,712
You've got your world, and l've got mine.

522
00:57:57,828 --> 00:57:59,548
All right, gentlemen.

523
00:58:02,946 --> 00:58:04,145
Sit down.

524
00:58:06,105 --> 00:58:08,863
Professor, you'll go ashore later
with Pablo Murphy and the guns.

525
00:58:08,903 --> 00:58:11,622
- Right.
- Keep talking to yourself, loudly.

526
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:14,060
l want my men to think
you're all still here.

527
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:16,058
That's no problem for me.

528
00:58:16,259 --> 00:58:18,858
Now, remember, this is a dangerous game.

529
00:58:19,018 --> 00:58:22,375
lf my men tumble to it,
they'll slit your throats, and mine, too.

530
00:58:22,456 --> 00:58:24,335
l don't like it, Captain.

531
00:58:24,774 --> 00:58:28,132
We can't leave you to face them alone.
Come with us.

532
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,372
Father...

533
00:58:30,890 --> 00:58:31,890
don't.

534
00:59:16,865 --> 00:59:18,545
Avast! Man the guns!

535
00:59:25,981 --> 00:59:27,659
Topside, you swabs!

536
00:59:41,492 --> 00:59:42,571
Help!

537
00:59:47,929 --> 00:59:51,167
Not so fast, Skipper,
if you'll pardon the intrusion.

538
01:00:10,757 --> 01:00:14,155
You've sold me, Humble Bellows,
and to a king's flunky.

539
01:00:14,235 --> 01:00:15,234
Aye.

540
01:00:15,714 --> 01:00:19,272
'Tis my modest opinion
that no man can fly pirate's colors...

541
01:00:19,352 --> 01:00:23,191
who's not willing to sell his friend,
his sweetheart, or his mother.

542
01:00:23,270 --> 01:00:26,148
- Well spoken, Mr. Bellows.
- Foul spoken it is.

543
01:00:26,508 --> 01:00:28,947
You've turned your hand
against your Captain's back.

544
01:00:29,027 --> 01:00:31,026
Yellow was never a pirate's color.

545
01:00:31,146 --> 01:00:33,864
Nor rescuing a fair maiden a pirate caper.

546
01:00:34,624 --> 01:00:35,663
Aye.

547
01:00:36,423 --> 01:00:39,061
lt's true. l sailed beyond my depth...

548
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:43,260
but only to sound out new waters
for the lot of us.

549
01:00:43,339 --> 01:00:47,377
lf we'd have starved to death,
l'd have never sold a man jack of you.

550
01:00:49,656 --> 01:00:53,454
Gather round, lads.
This isn't the last of the pirate capers.

551
01:00:53,493 --> 01:00:56,172
'Tis the last of thee and of thy capers...

552
01:00:56,612 --> 01:01:00,729
for 'twas put to the vote whilst thee
was trying to deprive us of our loot.

553
01:01:00,810 --> 01:01:04,687
Ye violated the pirate code
by letting a fat fish off the hook.

554
01:01:05,927 --> 01:01:08,766
By vote of all,
ye are deprived of command...

555
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:13,242
and sentenced under piratical law
to be cast adrift in a small boat...

556
01:01:13,882 --> 01:01:15,681
without food or water.

557
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:22,077
A splendid decision, Mr. Bellows.
Quick justice and certain death.

558
01:01:22,877 --> 01:01:27,035
Perhaps you'd save the King the expense
of hanging this learned fool...

559
01:01:27,195 --> 01:01:29,114
and let him keep Captain Vallo company.

560
01:01:30,354 --> 01:01:32,391
Thou hast a generous choice.

561
01:01:32,671 --> 01:01:34,511
The gallows or the sea.

562
01:01:42,547 --> 01:01:44,305
lf it won't crowd you.

563
01:01:46,225 --> 01:01:49,703
l'd rather you weren't coming,
but l don't want to seem inhospitable.

564
01:01:51,383 --> 01:01:52,782
As for thee...

565
01:01:54,101 --> 01:01:57,738
since l have no voice to raise against
thy Captain's misdemeanors...

566
01:01:57,819 --> 01:02:01,417
thee will be pardoned by giving thy hand
to thy new skipper.

567
01:02:01,696 --> 01:02:04,855
What say thee? Shall we loose thy bonds?

568
01:02:16,049 --> 01:02:17,488
Cut him loose.

569
01:02:51,749 --> 01:02:54,507
lt's done, Skipper. We set them adrift.

570
01:02:54,988 --> 01:02:57,706
The morning tide
will take them out to sea.

571
01:03:07,421 --> 01:03:10,539
Wait! This calls for a celebration,
eh, Mr. Bellows?

572
01:03:10,939 --> 01:03:14,776
l've a keg of rum aboard my boat.
Straight from the Governor's own cellar.

573
01:03:14,856 --> 01:03:16,056
What say?

574
01:03:17,576 --> 01:03:18,614
Aye.

575
01:03:18,975 --> 01:03:20,413
l could use a drink.

576
01:03:20,813 --> 01:03:23,133
Come on, lads! Get the rum aboard.

577
01:03:26,490 --> 01:03:28,809
Bring mine to the Captain's cabin.

578
01:03:34,606 --> 01:03:37,484
There's the end of land.
The end of our world.

579
01:03:37,604 --> 01:03:40,243
From now on, it's starve, thirst,
and finally capsize.

580
01:03:40,803 --> 01:03:43,122
l've been meditating on just that.

581
01:03:43,522 --> 01:03:47,520
Capsizing is the solution of our problem.
There's no doubt about it.

582
01:03:48,638 --> 01:03:51,197
- lf you'll follow me, please.
- Sit down, you fool!

583
01:03:54,435 --> 01:03:55,835
Sit down, you...

584
01:04:26,217 --> 01:04:27,418
lt works.

585
01:04:29,057 --> 01:04:30,736
Good old Aristotle.

586
01:04:30,775 --> 01:04:33,054
Over 2,000 years ago, he wrote:

587
01:04:33,135 --> 01:04:36,853
"A metallic vessel will retain air
underwater without filling."

588
01:04:36,892 --> 01:04:39,490
But l myself have done some research
on the subject...

589
01:04:39,571 --> 01:04:42,849
while designing a craft
which l call an undersea boat.

590
01:04:42,929 --> 01:04:46,607
- How did you know this was airtight?
- ln science, my son...

591
01:04:47,127 --> 01:04:49,765
one knows nothing until one experiments.

592
01:04:50,924 --> 01:04:53,643
We may now conclude
that we are breathing.

593
01:04:53,803 --> 01:04:56,203
Let us walk ashore as quickly as possible.

594
01:04:56,242 --> 01:04:59,600
l compute there's sufficient air
to last us several minutes.

595
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:02,439
Providing we don't waste
our oxygen talking, of course.

596
01:05:02,518 --> 01:05:04,958
- All right, then. Shut up!
- Quite so.

597
01:07:07,330 --> 01:07:11,249
You needn't have brought out
the whole garrison. l did the job myself.

598
01:07:11,329 --> 01:07:13,927
They won't be so playful
when they wake up this time.

599
01:07:14,007 --> 01:07:15,887
All right. Wake them up.

600
01:07:16,126 --> 01:07:18,244
Sober them up
and take them to the pirate ship.

601
01:07:18,325 --> 01:07:20,004
Over the side with them!

602
01:07:47,629 --> 01:07:50,507
Sorry l be for this, mates.
And l humbly apologize.

603
01:07:50,547 --> 01:07:53,226
'Twould never have happened
with Vallo as skipper.

604
01:07:53,546 --> 01:07:56,384
He violated a pirate code
and he had to go.

605
01:07:56,784 --> 01:07:59,942
But he went like a pirate.
We're going like fish.

606
01:07:59,982 --> 01:08:02,540
l can't forgive myself for that.

607
01:08:03,779 --> 01:08:06,938
King's flunky made a monkey
of Humble Bellows.

608
01:08:07,299 --> 01:08:10,016
- Pirate of the old school.
- Enough of that!

609
01:08:10,056 --> 01:08:11,376
Hoist them!

610
01:08:17,173 --> 01:08:19,732
Put a crew aboard this ship
and have her re-canvased.

611
01:08:19,773 --> 01:08:22,290
l want her ready to sail when l leave.

612
01:08:22,570 --> 01:08:25,968
Give them just enough bread
and water to keep them alive.

613
01:08:26,048 --> 01:08:28,767
They'll fetch a good bounty from the King.

614
01:09:02,389 --> 01:09:04,067
Ahoy. Pablo Murphy.

615
01:09:05,627 --> 01:09:07,905
- Well, l'll be...
- Get us out of these chains.

616
01:09:07,985 --> 01:09:11,064
After all you got us into,
you lying blabbermouth?

617
01:09:11,103 --> 01:09:12,943
Get yourself out of it.

618
01:09:25,216 --> 01:09:28,295
- Pablo Murphy.
- For the last time, get away from us.

619
01:09:28,774 --> 01:09:31,252
Get it through that head of yours,
l didn't sell El Libre.

620
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:34,091
- Let me assure...
- We can see for ourselves what he's done.

621
01:09:34,131 --> 01:09:36,770
lf we'd gone my way,
El Libre wouldn't be dead.

622
01:09:36,850 --> 01:09:39,009
Consuelo wouldn't be held captive
in the palace...

623
01:09:39,089 --> 01:09:41,927
and we'd have guns to stop Gruda's men
from crushing us.

624
01:09:41,966 --> 01:09:44,086
Hold it, gentlemen. Soldiers.

625
01:09:52,841 --> 01:09:56,999
By order of Baron Gruda, all fishing
will be done under armed escort.

626
01:09:57,239 --> 01:09:59,557
The entire catch to be turned over
to the Governor.

627
01:09:59,597 --> 01:10:01,757
- What'll be left for us?
- The bait.

628
01:10:02,076 --> 01:10:03,874
ln that case, we'll do no fishing.

629
01:10:05,954 --> 01:10:07,633
Any more objections?

630
01:10:08,793 --> 01:10:11,791
The rest of you proceed
to the Governor's dock. Get moving!

631
01:10:13,150 --> 01:10:15,069
Take him to the fortress.

632
01:10:29,301 --> 01:10:30,541
This way.

633
01:11:11,399 --> 01:11:14,356
- Hey, there, back in line.
- Follow those boats.

634
01:11:47,578 --> 01:11:48,898
After them!

635
01:13:07,295 --> 01:13:08,494
Let's go.

636
01:13:39,598 --> 01:13:42,756
- ls everything arranged?
- Just as you ordered, Excellency.

637
01:13:42,796 --> 01:13:46,154
You've broken the back of the rebellion
overnight. The King owes you much.

638
01:13:46,234 --> 01:13:50,191
He will pay it. l may even be able to collect
the full bounty on Captain Vallo...

639
01:13:50,272 --> 01:13:53,990
for he was killed by his own men
while trying to save El Libre.

640
01:13:57,988 --> 01:13:59,868
Don't be upset, my dear.

641
01:14:00,227 --> 01:14:03,744
You'll form new attachments here.
You're to marry the Governor.

642
01:14:03,825 --> 01:14:06,464
After l'm gone,
you'll rule through her, Governor.

643
01:14:06,543 --> 01:14:09,582
You'll order your people to till their fields
and fish their seas...

644
01:14:09,661 --> 01:14:11,382
for the greater glory of the King.

645
01:14:11,421 --> 01:14:14,059
- l'd die first.
- No, you'll die last.

646
01:14:14,419 --> 01:14:17,297
First you'll watch your people go
one by one.

647
01:14:35,089 --> 01:14:36,846
Someday l'll kill you.

648
01:14:38,406 --> 01:14:39,565
Officer!

649
01:14:45,562 --> 01:14:47,521
These methods will bring her round soon.

650
01:14:47,601 --> 01:14:50,280
l shouldn't like her to kill herself
before she marries.

651
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:54,197
She's not the type. She'll marry you
and wait for a chance to poison you.

652
01:14:54,278 --> 01:14:57,597
lt doesn't sound like an ideal marriage.
Couldn't we dispense with that?

653
01:14:57,636 --> 01:14:59,875
Too much of it upsets my liver.

654
01:15:01,753 --> 01:15:05,432
lt's not your liver. lt's your heart.
lt's much too soft.

655
01:15:08,550 --> 01:15:10,909
Tonight the people bury El Libre.

656
01:15:11,148 --> 01:15:14,346
l want a proclamation posted
in the path of the funeral procession...

657
01:15:14,426 --> 01:15:16,866
announcing your marriage
to the daughter of El Libre.

658
01:15:16,945 --> 01:15:18,225
Excellency!

659
01:15:18,904 --> 01:15:22,422
People will be required to attend
and provide entertainment...

660
01:15:22,581 --> 01:15:24,301
to make it a day of rejoicing.

661
01:15:24,341 --> 01:15:26,580
We'll have them fill
the royal grain warehouse...

662
01:15:26,620 --> 01:15:28,860
with 10,000 sacks of grain as a present.

663
01:15:29,339 --> 01:15:31,059
You're learning fast.

664
01:15:31,178 --> 01:15:35,535
After the ceremony, l'll leave you
my troops and my blessings, and depart.

665
01:15:37,294 --> 01:15:41,612
Except for the late, lamented Vallo,
this has been a most boring assignment.

666
01:15:51,926 --> 01:15:55,445
On your way, pig! Amnesty
has been declared for all prisoners.

667
01:15:55,524 --> 01:15:58,922
Baron Gruda will give you a chance
to show allegiance at the wedding.

668
01:16:00,002 --> 01:16:01,161
Gruda.

669
01:16:02,801 --> 01:16:05,239
Gruda, someday l'll kill you.

670
01:16:06,238 --> 01:16:07,638
l'll kill you!

671
01:16:09,756 --> 01:16:13,154
- So it's a marriage now, is it?
- Consuelo will never do it.

672
01:16:13,235 --> 01:16:15,953
Look! 10,000 sacks of grain
for the Governor.

673
01:16:15,994 --> 01:16:17,233
Not mine!

674
01:16:17,592 --> 01:16:19,471
So we're to rejoice, are we?

675
01:16:32,823 --> 01:16:35,782
Baron Gruda has made
the defacing of public property...

676
01:16:35,863 --> 01:16:38,061
an offense punishable by death...

677
01:16:38,101 --> 01:16:40,820
both for the culprit and the accomplices.

678
01:16:41,139 --> 01:16:43,378
Sergeant, round up these people.

679
01:17:11,644 --> 01:17:14,801
- What are you going to do about it?
- lt's no concern of mine.

680
01:17:22,997 --> 01:17:26,155
- What are you going to do about her?
- Get her out of it, somehow.

681
01:17:26,554 --> 01:17:28,873
Alone, against 1,000 troops?

682
01:17:29,393 --> 01:17:31,512
- There must be a way.
- There is.

683
01:17:31,592 --> 01:17:34,551
lt's a question of simple logic.
We need allies.

684
01:17:34,951 --> 01:17:37,468
These people need freedom.
Let's help them get it.

685
01:17:37,549 --> 01:17:39,947
The only freedom
l'm interested in is Consuelo's.

686
01:17:40,028 --> 01:17:43,106
She'll never consent to be free
until her people are free.

687
01:17:43,146 --> 01:17:44,465
lmpossible.

688
01:17:45,065 --> 01:17:47,584
They don't have a chance
against Gruda's crack troops.

689
01:17:47,664 --> 01:17:50,621
Science has learned
that nothing is impossible.

690
01:17:50,661 --> 01:17:54,420
Not long ago, l saw a ship
sailing through the skies of France...

691
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:58,458
supported by a great bag filled with air
that was lighter than air.

692
01:17:59,098 --> 01:18:03,135
A friend of mine has invented a liquid
that can blast away mountains.

693
01:18:03,574 --> 01:18:07,613
l have completed plans for a boat
that can sail underneath the water.

694
01:18:08,252 --> 01:18:09,932
Who knows what we may accomplish...

695
01:18:10,012 --> 01:18:13,009
against the outdated Baron Gruda
and his outdated world?

696
01:18:13,090 --> 01:18:15,288
All we need is the help of these people...

697
01:18:15,368 --> 01:18:20,046
a little imagination, and deft fingers
with which to steal a few basic materials.

698
01:18:45,112 --> 01:18:46,791
The Baron thinks we're finished.

699
01:18:46,871 --> 01:18:49,309
We're going to let him go on thinking so.

700
01:18:49,390 --> 01:18:52,029
We'll fill the royal grain warehouse
as ordered.

701
01:18:52,068 --> 01:18:54,308
But with the seeds
of the Professor's genius.

702
01:18:54,348 --> 01:18:57,506
- l beg your pardon?
- The Baron has the most weapons.

703
01:18:57,585 --> 01:18:59,025
But we'll have the newest.

704
01:18:59,105 --> 01:19:02,144
An explosive that moves mountains.
A ship that flies through the air.

705
01:19:02,222 --> 01:19:05,862
A ship that flies through the air
by next Sunday? lmpossible.

706
01:19:06,381 --> 01:19:08,139
A great man once said to me:

707
01:19:08,219 --> 01:19:10,618
"Science has learned
that nothing is impossible."

708
01:19:13,857 --> 01:19:16,016
Gather round, lads and lasses.

709
01:19:16,455 --> 01:19:20,693
We'll show your fighters and workers
new ways to get rid of old enemies.

710
01:20:12,025 --> 01:20:13,865
lt doesn't smell right.

711
01:20:15,384 --> 01:20:18,021
10,000 sacks of grain have been brought
into the warehouse.

712
01:20:18,102 --> 01:20:20,100
The tunnel to smuggle them out
is complete.

713
01:20:20,181 --> 01:20:23,379
The island is making headway
with the modern weapons to smuggle in...

714
01:20:23,459 --> 01:20:25,618
and still you stand and stir...

715
01:20:25,698 --> 01:20:27,577
that stew with no result.

716
01:20:27,657 --> 01:20:30,335
My friend sent me no formula to go on...

717
01:20:30,415 --> 01:20:33,854
simply the ingredients.
Principally nitrogen and glycerin.

718
01:20:33,933 --> 01:20:36,333
Anyway, l'm not really sure
l want to discover it.

719
01:20:36,412 --> 01:20:40,010
lf it can remove a mountain,
how do l know it won't remove an island?

720
01:20:40,050 --> 01:20:43,008
"ln science, one knows nothing
unless one experiments."

721
01:20:43,088 --> 01:20:45,207
l wish you'd stop quoting me.

722
01:20:51,843 --> 01:20:53,603
That's it.

723
01:21:01,118 --> 01:21:02,357
Soldiers!

724
01:21:05,435 --> 01:21:07,355
Don't fall down with that.

725
01:21:07,595 --> 01:21:09,434
Even if they shoot you.

726
01:21:38,338 --> 01:21:41,097
Be careful you don't over-inflate this
in the morning.

727
01:21:41,417 --> 01:21:43,815
We've cut the wall braces
to the breaking point.

728
01:21:43,896 --> 01:21:47,013
But we don't want them to collapse
before the signal.

729
01:21:47,053 --> 01:21:48,133
Remember...

730
01:21:48,213 --> 01:21:52,011
there'll be no signal given till Consuelo's
gotten safely away from Baron Gruda.

731
01:21:58,448 --> 01:21:59,606
Careful.

732
01:22:06,203 --> 01:22:07,923
The liquid explosive.

733
01:22:09,481 --> 01:22:13,039
- ls that all that's left?
- l've improved a bit on the formula.

734
01:22:13,079 --> 01:22:15,477
This is concentrated 1,000 times.

735
01:22:25,553 --> 01:22:26,752
Please.

736
01:23:05,571 --> 01:23:09,049
The royal grain warehouse is reported
full to capacity, Your Excellency.

737
01:23:09,129 --> 01:23:11,928
Amazing how you brought them
to their knees.

738
01:23:11,967 --> 01:23:16,126
Spare the rod and spoil the child.
Never forget that, my dear Governor.

739
01:23:16,765 --> 01:23:18,843
Let's get on with the wedding ceremony.

740
01:23:21,442 --> 01:23:25,960
First, a floral offering for the bride
from the unmarried girls of the island.

741
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,439
A local custom for celebrating weddings.

742
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:30,237
- Proceed.
- Music.

743
01:24:05,019 --> 01:24:07,257
Watch it. Your beard is showing.

744
01:24:07,857 --> 01:24:09,176
Here we go.

745
01:24:14,373 --> 01:24:16,933
These peasant shapes are not to my taste.

746
01:24:28,566 --> 01:24:29,885
Death to Gruda!

747
01:24:41,198 --> 01:24:42,478
Kill them!

748
01:25:12,182 --> 01:25:14,182
Port side battery. Fire!

749
01:25:22,417 --> 01:25:24,575
No, l mean left. Left!

750
01:25:24,656 --> 01:25:26,853
No. Right. No, left a bit.

751
01:25:28,294 --> 01:25:29,813
What's the matter with you?

752
01:25:29,893 --> 01:25:31,932
Don't you know where you're going?

753
01:25:56,439 --> 01:25:57,477
Fire!

754
01:26:07,991 --> 01:26:09,631
We're going after the girl.

755
01:26:38,816 --> 01:26:40,135
Let's strip for action.

756
01:26:47,890 --> 01:26:48,931
Halt!

757
01:26:51,809 --> 01:26:54,526
We'll cut her to pieces. Man your cannons.

758
01:26:55,886 --> 01:26:57,046
Come on, now.

759
01:27:05,002 --> 01:27:06,959
The high explosive. Quick.

760
01:27:42,901 --> 01:27:45,219
- Get underway!
- Aye, aye, sir.

761
01:27:47,618 --> 01:27:49,139
Man the capstan!

762
01:27:53,854 --> 01:27:55,295
Get her below.

763
01:27:56,893 --> 01:27:59,013
Don't waste time. Slit the cable!

764
01:28:03,408 --> 01:28:06,328
We've got to gain altitude.
Unload the ballast.

765
01:28:14,003 --> 01:28:15,762
Come on. Get rid of something.

766
01:28:26,316 --> 01:28:28,876
- What is it?
- lt is the wrath of heaven!

767
01:28:28,956 --> 01:28:30,795
lt has destroyed the fortress!

768
01:28:33,033 --> 01:28:35,631
Our ship and our lads.
We're heading straight for them.

769
01:28:36,991 --> 01:28:38,430
Make it close.

770
01:28:40,550 --> 01:28:41,988
But not too close.

771
01:28:42,029 --> 01:28:45,107
We'll need our ship and our lads
to catch Gruda.

772
01:28:50,424 --> 01:28:52,823
They're going to blow us up!
Jump for your lives!

773
01:29:25,485 --> 01:29:27,684
- lt's our own skipper!
- We knew you'd come.

774
01:29:27,723 --> 01:29:29,764
Get us off this ship.

775
01:29:29,802 --> 01:29:32,400
- Cut the rope down.
- Get us out of here!

776
01:29:48,352 --> 01:29:51,272
Pack out all canvas,
you fairy-tale sea snakes!

777
01:29:51,351 --> 01:29:52,670
Go get 'em!

778
01:29:57,787 --> 01:29:58,986
Move them!

779
01:29:59,227 --> 01:30:00,146
Move!

780
01:30:28,490 --> 01:30:31,489
l really think he plans to do battle with us.

781
01:30:34,168 --> 01:30:36,846
Captain Vallo's lost his head
as well as his heart.

782
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:52,158
Haul that jib.

783
01:30:55,076 --> 01:30:56,915
Trim those top gallows.

784
01:30:57,675 --> 01:30:59,154
Two points starboard.

785
01:31:11,148 --> 01:31:13,147
Hold your fire for a broadside.

786
01:31:13,227 --> 01:31:15,265
Shall we fire?

787
01:31:15,345 --> 01:31:18,823
There'll be no firing with the girl
on the ship. We're going to board her.

788
01:31:27,659 --> 01:31:29,698
Below decks, the lot of you.

789
01:31:29,818 --> 01:31:31,257
On the double.

790
01:31:38,813 --> 01:31:40,492
Coming, Mr. Bellows?

791
01:31:42,331 --> 01:31:44,890
The fools are going
to trade broadsides with us.

792
01:31:51,965 --> 01:31:53,245
ln you go.

793
01:31:56,843 --> 01:31:59,561
With nobody at the wheel to steer,
we'll not get alongside.

794
01:31:59,641 --> 01:32:02,359
Too late to worry about it.
We'll have to take our chances.

795
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:04,400
As ye wish. We'll go.

796
01:32:11,115 --> 01:32:12,913
My humble apologies.

797
01:32:12,954 --> 01:32:16,033
But if l can't live like a pirate,
l'll die like one.

798
01:32:16,113 --> 01:32:18,831
l'll stand by the wheel
and bring her alongside.

799
01:32:18,871 --> 01:32:21,230
Skipper! Do them the dirty!

800
01:33:10,083 --> 01:33:11,642
Stand by to fire!

801
01:33:21,356 --> 01:33:22,236
Fire!

802
01:37:05,236 --> 01:37:07,154
We're lost! Get the girl!

803
01:39:28,838 --> 01:39:31,077
Hold it, Professor! We've won!

804
01:39:31,316 --> 01:39:33,115
Get rid of that stuff.

805
01:40:10,616 --> 01:40:11,574
yeah +++++
