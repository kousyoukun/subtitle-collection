1
00:00:15,895 --> 00:00:18,397
Man the yards! Quick on all canvas!

2
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,528
Gather round, lads and lasses.
Gather round.

3
00:00:23,819 --> 00:00:27,073
You've been shanghaied aboard
for the last cruise of the Crimson Pirate...

4
00:00:27,365 --> 00:00:29,909
a long, long time ago
in the far, far Caribbean.

5
00:00:30,201 --> 00:00:33,829
Remember, in a pirate ship,
in pirate waters, in a pirate world...

6
00:00:34,413 --> 00:00:37,041
ask no questions.
Believe only what you see.

7
00:00:43,756 --> 00:00:46,467
No. Believe half of what you see.

8
00:00:48,427 --> 00:00:50,972
Man the capstan! Up anchor!

9
00:00:51,597 --> 00:00:53,391
Move, you lubbers!

10
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,605
Ship to starboard!

11
00:02:35,326 --> 00:02:36,369
Attention!

12
00:02:49,131 --> 00:02:51,342
A scurvy ship, Your Excellency.

13
00:02:52,134 --> 00:02:55,971
You can tell by the position of the limbs.
Scurvy's killed the whole crew.

14
00:03:01,018 --> 00:03:03,562
A trim little ship, Captain Rodriguez.

15
00:03:04,021 --> 00:03:06,982
We'll take her in tow.
She'll bring a tidy sum.

16
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,278
Put an officer and two men aboard her,
and have her in tow by nightfall.

17
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:12,655
Aye, aye, sir.

18
00:04:12,381 --> 00:04:15,509
- Only evil can come from a death ship.
- Aye.

19
00:04:16,302 --> 00:04:18,220
Sanctus, one of them touched me!

20
00:04:19,472 --> 00:04:21,390
What happened to those two?

21
00:04:22,224 --> 00:04:23,392
Follow me.

22
00:04:59,303 --> 00:05:01,639
My humble apologies.

23
00:07:04,845 --> 00:07:05,638
Bored?

24
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:09,350
If only there was something
to break the monotony of this voyage.

25
00:07:10,601 --> 00:07:12,311
Hands aloft, please.

26
00:07:19,526 --> 00:07:22,279
You're the prisoners of Captain Vallo
and his scurvy crew.

27
00:07:39,922 --> 00:07:41,924
You may be overconfident, Captain Vallo.

28
00:07:42,216 --> 00:07:44,635
Two hundred of the King's marines
are aboard this vessel.

29
00:07:44,927 --> 00:07:47,763
And only 20 pirates.
That puts the odds slightly in my favor.

30
00:07:48,055 --> 00:07:51,058
- Better surrender the ship.
- I am merely a passenger.

31
00:07:51,809 --> 00:07:53,560
- Who is he?
- Baron Gruda.

32
00:07:53,852 --> 00:07:55,896
Special envoy to His Majesty.

33
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:00,401
Well, this is a pleasure.

34
00:08:00,901 --> 00:08:04,196
- You hanged most of my friends.
- For murdering most of mine.

35
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:11,036
Seems you have
only 199 marines now, Baron.

36
00:08:12,788 --> 00:08:16,041
198. Better persuade the Captain
to surrender.

37
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:17,960
The Captain is not the type to...

38
00:08:19,795 --> 00:08:21,171
197.

39
00:08:21,463 --> 00:08:24,425
However, if you'll permit me
to speak to him...

40
00:08:28,137 --> 00:08:30,139
Ojo, pass the word for the Captain.

41
00:08:36,895 --> 00:08:39,523
Bring down the Captain!

42
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,526
Send down the Captain!

43
00:08:43,152 --> 00:08:45,029
Save the Captain!

44
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,156
Send down the Captain!

45
00:08:51,285 --> 00:08:53,412
Did you ask for the Captain, sir?

46
00:08:53,704 --> 00:08:56,457
Aye. Pay him my compliments
and show him in.

47
00:09:26,236 --> 00:09:28,155
Gather round, lads. Gather round.

48
00:09:32,868 --> 00:09:33,827
We're in luck.

49
00:09:34,119 --> 00:09:36,830
All hands will soon be digging into
a fat divvy.

50
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:41,418
We're heading for the biggest
and the best pirate days ever.

51
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:44,421
And here's the rich tally in round numbers.

52
00:09:45,547 --> 00:09:47,132
"Muskets: 3,000.

53
00:09:47,966 --> 00:09:49,885
"Powder kegs: 1,500.

54
00:09:50,636 --> 00:09:53,555
"Rounds of musket shot: 65,000.

55
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:58,018
- "Rounds of cannon shot..."
- Begging thy pardon for interrupting...

56
00:09:58,477 --> 00:10:00,604
but when will thee get into the gold?

57
00:10:04,191 --> 00:10:05,692
Listen, fellows, listen.

58
00:10:05,984 --> 00:10:09,446
There are islands in these waters
steaming with rebellion against the King...

59
00:10:09,738 --> 00:10:12,616
and kept from boiling over
only for lack of guns.

60
00:10:12,908 --> 00:10:15,452
Islands where guns
are worth more than gold.

61
00:10:15,744 --> 00:10:17,788
- More than diamonds.
- Gunrunning?

62
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,083
But that's not piracy, Skipper.
That's business.

63
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:24,920
- That means working ashore.
- We're doing poorly enough afloat.

64
00:10:25,546 --> 00:10:28,882
If we're going to try this new caper,
let's make it a good one.

65
00:10:29,174 --> 00:10:33,846
This cargo will bring 50,000 gold florin
from any rebels worth the name.

66
00:10:34,138 --> 00:10:37,349
- 50,000 florin?
- That's a pretty good take.

67
00:10:37,641 --> 00:10:39,768
Let's put it to the vote.
All those in favor...

68
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,604
If you'll forgive
my interrupting, Skipper...

69
00:10:42,896 --> 00:10:45,315
I'd like to think before I vote.

70
00:10:45,774 --> 00:10:48,986
Meantime, we got
regular pirate business to settle.

71
00:10:49,945 --> 00:10:51,664
We got the plank, the culprit,

72
00:10:51,864 --> 00:10:52,781
and the verdict.

73
00:10:53,073 --> 00:10:56,493
All we need's a trial
and execution of a sentence.

74
00:10:56,785 --> 00:10:57,870
He's guilty!

75
00:10:58,287 --> 00:11:01,039
So much for the trial. Now for execution.

76
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:04,001
Come on. Kill me, you fools.

77
00:11:04,293 --> 00:11:08,505
The King's Navy will scour the Seven Seas
till every one of you is hung high and dry.

78
00:11:08,797 --> 00:11:11,508
- To the plank with him!
- Avast!

79
00:11:19,766 --> 00:11:21,602
There'll be no plank-walking for him.

80
00:11:21,894 --> 00:11:24,062
Forgive my slow-wittedness, Skipper...

81
00:11:24,354 --> 00:11:28,150
but are thee asking us to spare
this sweet-smelling toad?

82
00:11:28,859 --> 00:11:31,069
Begging Thy Excellency's pardon.

83
00:11:31,361 --> 00:11:34,323
Your captain's got more brains
than all of you put together.

84
00:11:34,615 --> 00:11:36,575
No doubt you intend
to hold me for ransom.

85
00:11:36,867 --> 00:11:40,204
No, my fine-feathered friend.
I'm setting you free.

86
00:11:41,288 --> 00:11:44,833
I say, if there's no profit in the monkey
we'll have our pleasure.

87
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:47,002
I say there is profit in him. Alive.

88
00:11:47,294 --> 00:11:49,463
- How much profit?
- Now hear me out.

89
00:11:51,924 --> 00:11:55,052
I said 50,000 gold florin
from the rebels for the guns...

90
00:11:55,344 --> 00:11:59,306
and here, by special commission,
is the King's chief rebel-catcher.

91
00:11:59,973 --> 00:12:02,643
So why not another 50,000
from him and his king...

92
00:12:02,935 --> 00:12:05,479
for telling them which rebels
we sell all the guns to.

93
00:12:05,771 --> 00:12:06,688
Eh, Baron?

94
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,524
A brilliant scheme, Captain.
My congratulations.

95
00:12:09,816 --> 00:12:11,401
Thy congratulations.

96
00:12:12,277 --> 00:12:15,572
If thou art for it,
it is not for the good of pirates.

97
00:12:15,864 --> 00:12:17,658
Good? Gentlemen, it's magnificent.

98
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:22,496
I'm bound for the Island of Cobra to catch
a man, El Libre, and smash his rebellion.

99
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:26,792
If you'll take the guns there, lure him
out of his hole and into my hands...

100
00:12:27,084 --> 00:12:29,461
I'll raise the purse another 50,000.

101
00:12:30,462 --> 00:12:34,466
There it is, lads, in round figures:

102
00:12:37,803 --> 00:12:40,472
What do you say now,
Mr. Humble Bellows?

103
00:12:41,139 --> 00:12:43,809
Thy humble servant will believe it...

104
00:12:44,101 --> 00:12:46,228
when thy humble servant sees it.

105
00:12:47,145 --> 00:12:49,439
I take it we have a deal, Captain.

106
00:13:21,471 --> 00:13:24,266
This change of ship, Captain,
most uncomfortable.

107
00:13:24,558 --> 00:13:27,644
My men won't transfer cargo.
Too much like honest work.

108
00:13:27,936 --> 00:13:31,189
Captain Vallo, your men have only left me
headsail and topsail.

109
00:13:31,481 --> 00:13:33,942
They're enough to get you to Cobra
sooner or later.

110
00:13:34,234 --> 00:13:36,153
My ship is faster than this barge.

111
00:13:36,445 --> 00:13:37,679
I don't want you making port

112
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:39,906
before I've got El Libre
ready for delivery...

113
00:13:40,198 --> 00:13:42,034
or putting a shot in my backside.

114
00:13:42,326 --> 00:13:45,620
I hope El Libre is not as careful
as you are, Captain.

115
00:13:57,424 --> 00:13:59,343
Cast off helm!

116
00:14:01,345 --> 00:14:03,430
Cast off stern!

117
00:14:05,557 --> 00:14:09,603
- Mr. Bellows, make sail!
- Aye, aye, sir!

118
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,630
Haul up, full and by.

119
00:14:37,172 --> 00:14:40,634
Nor' nor' east.
We're heading for the Isle of Cobra.

120
00:14:41,301 --> 00:14:43,303
Come on, you lubbers, move!

121
00:15:19,714 --> 00:15:22,509
Hear ye, hear ye!

122
00:15:22,843 --> 00:15:25,887
The King's vessel is now at anchor...

123
00:15:26,179 --> 00:15:29,433
in the port of Cobra
with Baron Gruda aboard.

124
00:15:29,724 --> 00:15:34,354
Any demonstration
will be regarded as high treason.

125
00:15:36,314 --> 00:15:38,316
The people seem very quiet, don't they?

126
00:15:38,608 --> 00:15:41,945
I don't think they intend to demonstrate
against Baron Gruda after all.

127
00:15:42,237 --> 00:15:44,698
- Apparently not, Governor.
- What a pity.

128
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:47,409
Our troops could've cut them down
like wheat.

129
00:15:47,909 --> 00:15:50,162
Couldn't we shoot a few
on general principles?

130
00:15:50,454 --> 00:15:51,621
Might impress the Baron.

131
00:15:51,913 --> 00:15:54,082
He might feel
you are merely provoking trouble.

132
00:15:54,374 --> 00:15:57,461
Most exasperating.
Fire the salute to Baron Gruda.

133
00:16:00,338 --> 00:16:01,590
Attention!

134
00:16:14,269 --> 00:16:18,398
Give the word and I'll dose
those backstabbers with a broadside.

135
00:16:18,857 --> 00:16:21,026
They're not firing at us,
you powder-brained ape.

136
00:16:21,318 --> 00:16:25,322
They're giving us a 15-gun salute.
We're flying the flag of Gruda.

137
00:16:25,614 --> 00:16:28,617
Slimey, bring out the flags
and run up that message I gave you.

138
00:16:29,534 --> 00:16:32,037
And, Slimey,
give the Governor my compliments.

139
00:16:32,329 --> 00:16:33,663
The Crimson Pirate's?

140
00:16:33,955 --> 00:16:36,249
No, you oyster-head, Baron Gruda's.

141
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:40,587
Mr. Bellows, keep the rest of these
half-masted monkeys below deck.

142
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:41,963
Aye, aye, Skipper.

143
00:16:42,255 --> 00:16:45,091
Keep a sharp lookout, lads.
I'll be back with El Libre tonight.

144
00:16:45,383 --> 00:16:46,718
Let's go, Ojo.

145
00:16:54,059 --> 00:16:58,271
There goes a good pirate,
to sell his wares like a fish peddler.

146
00:16:58,897 --> 00:17:01,233
Meaning no disrespect to the Skipper,
of course.

147
00:17:01,525 --> 00:17:03,109
Us with a price on our heads...

148
00:17:03,401 --> 00:17:07,447
holed, too, in one of His Majesty's ports
like sitting ducks.

149
00:17:08,281 --> 00:17:12,536
But if the Skipper pulls us through again,
we'd be the ducks with the golden eggs.

150
00:17:12,827 --> 00:17:13,947
You're thinking of geese,

151
00:17:14,147 --> 00:17:16,164
if you'll pardon the
correction, Poison Paul.

152
00:17:16,706 --> 00:17:19,501
Geese on a wild-goose chase.

153
00:17:30,929 --> 00:17:32,264
What do they say, Joseph?

154
00:17:32,556 --> 00:17:35,684
They've got the plague on board,
and they're quarantining themselves...

155
00:17:35,976 --> 00:17:37,852
until the victims are killed or cured.

156
00:17:39,354 --> 00:17:42,023
We must signal my profound condolences
to Baron Gruda.

157
00:17:42,315 --> 00:17:44,943
- Very well, Governor.
- Maybe it's all for the best, Joseph.

158
00:17:45,235 --> 00:17:47,404
El Libre's followers
may yet show their hands...

159
00:17:47,696 --> 00:17:50,323
and give me a chance to impress
the Baron. Order my carriage.

160
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:54,744
Disperse the crowd. Change the guard,
and double your patrols in the street.

161
00:17:56,121 --> 00:17:57,956
Come on, my popsy-wopsy-wopsies.

162
00:18:08,967 --> 00:18:12,929
Plague, is it? May it take all of them.
Baron Gruda first.

163
00:18:13,471 --> 00:18:16,016
Aye, and if the plague don't, we will.

164
00:18:18,727 --> 00:18:21,146
- Who are you?
- Simple fisher folk like yourselves.

165
00:18:21,438 --> 00:18:23,544
Put in for a tankard of
ale, a friendly word,

166
00:18:23,744 --> 00:18:25,275
and a chance to fight the King.

167
00:18:28,278 --> 00:18:29,654
Why choose us?

168
00:18:34,534 --> 00:18:36,244
You look and talk like a fighter.

169
00:18:36,828 --> 00:18:38,121
It takes one to know one.

170
00:18:38,413 --> 00:18:40,915
You may have us marked, all right.
Maybe not.

171
00:18:41,207 --> 00:18:42,959
But we haven't marked you yet.

172
00:18:43,251 --> 00:18:45,545
- We're asking no questions.
- We are.

173
00:18:46,546 --> 00:18:49,007
What I've heard about El Libre
is good enough for me.

174
00:18:49,299 --> 00:18:50,634
Tell us how to contact him.

175
00:18:50,925 --> 00:18:54,304
A man like him would be pleased to have
two more strong-armed lads aboard.

176
00:19:01,686 --> 00:19:03,605
Not very trusting souls, are they?

177
00:19:15,408 --> 00:19:18,578
I guess we'll have to prove
our high regard for El Libre.

178
00:19:31,549 --> 00:19:34,052
Ojo, you took the words
right out of my mouth.

179
00:19:34,344 --> 00:19:36,471
A brawl with the King's men. Let's go.

180
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:45,897
Left, right. Left. Mark time!

181
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,193
Right turn.

182
00:19:52,237 --> 00:19:53,238
Halt!

183
00:19:55,699 --> 00:19:59,494
Quick march! Forward! Halt! Turn!

184
00:20:08,712 --> 00:20:10,714
Right wheel!

185
00:20:15,927 --> 00:20:17,971
March!

186
00:20:20,348 --> 00:20:21,391
Halt!

187
00:20:23,435 --> 00:20:25,145
Present arms!

188
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,177
Long live the republic!

189
00:20:57,469 --> 00:20:59,179
Rebels! Get them!

190
00:21:14,652 --> 00:21:15,945
Long live El Libre!

191
00:21:16,237 --> 00:21:17,489
After them!

192
00:22:00,156 --> 00:22:01,324
There they are!

193
00:22:02,951 --> 00:22:04,327
Don't let them get away!

194
00:22:32,313 --> 00:22:34,190
Men! Come on!

195
00:23:43,092 --> 00:23:44,844
Come on! Quick, in that corner.

196
00:23:46,137 --> 00:23:47,555
There they go!

197
00:23:59,567 --> 00:24:01,194
Hurry up. In back.

198
00:24:03,988 --> 00:24:05,198
This way!

199
00:24:09,953 --> 00:24:10,828
Go ahead.

200
00:24:19,379 --> 00:24:20,463
Pierce the canvas.

201
00:24:34,394 --> 00:24:35,395
Fire!

202
00:24:43,027 --> 00:24:44,070
Ready? Fire!

203
00:24:54,998 --> 00:24:57,875
Pick it up! Lift it up!
Come on. Lift it up! Fire!

204
00:25:02,296 --> 00:25:03,423
Take us away.

205
00:25:05,883 --> 00:25:07,593
They're getting away!

206
00:25:25,945 --> 00:25:28,406
Latch the cellars! Block the alley!

207
00:25:44,297 --> 00:25:45,381
Look out. Soldiers.

208
00:25:51,637 --> 00:25:52,764
Just a minute.

209
00:26:03,107 --> 00:26:04,358
Search the place.

210
00:27:03,876 --> 00:27:06,754
- The stink would drive away a pig.
- Which it did.

211
00:27:08,381 --> 00:27:10,007
Watch that door.

212
00:27:16,514 --> 00:27:18,558
You've saved us, lad, you've saved us.

213
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:20,518
We're among our own kind.

214
00:27:21,894 --> 00:27:23,062
Rebels.

215
00:27:23,479 --> 00:27:25,815
Wouldn't surprise me
if you were El Libre himself.

216
00:27:26,149 --> 00:27:29,527
- You look like a born leader of men.
- The name's Pablo Murphy.

217
00:27:29,819 --> 00:27:33,406
And I got enough Irish from me father
to know blarney when I hear it.

218
00:27:33,698 --> 00:27:36,325
We'd have slit your throats
for snooping spies by now...

219
00:27:36,617 --> 00:27:38,202
only for what you did to them soldiers.

220
00:27:38,494 --> 00:27:40,371
- Who are they?
- Who knows?

221
00:27:40,663 --> 00:27:42,915
This one can't talk
and this one can't keep quiet.

222
00:27:43,207 --> 00:27:46,460
All right, let's get to the point.
I'm Captain Vallo at your service.

223
00:27:46,752 --> 00:27:48,296
And this is Lieutenant Ojo.

224
00:27:51,632 --> 00:27:53,718
Vallo? The pirate?

225
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:55,386
The Crimson Pirate?

226
00:27:55,678 --> 00:27:58,556
That's right, sweet mother,
with a bargain for El Libre...

227
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:00,808
a shipload of powder shot and musketry.

228
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,269
- Baron Gruda's ship.
- Baron Gruda's ship?

229
00:28:03,561 --> 00:28:05,813
Aye. Baron Gruda's own 30-gunner.

230
00:28:06,439 --> 00:28:09,275
We took her as easy as you'd take
a mackerel, fine fishermen.

231
00:28:09,567 --> 00:28:11,652
Easier. For we used dead bait.

232
00:28:12,278 --> 00:28:14,197
You killed Baron Gruda?

233
00:28:15,531 --> 00:28:18,409
If I did that you wouldn't need the guns
I want to sell you.

234
00:28:18,701 --> 00:28:20,828
I'm a pirate, not a dog killer.

235
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,414
But I like you lads. I like your style.

236
00:28:23,706 --> 00:28:25,416
So gather round and get this:

237
00:28:25,708 --> 00:28:29,420
The Baron will arrive in port
aboard my own ship in a matter of days.

238
00:28:29,712 --> 00:28:33,424
So how about taking me to El Libre
so we can close the deal for the guns?

239
00:28:33,716 --> 00:28:35,426
Time and tide, you know.

240
00:28:56,322 --> 00:28:58,282
Wash the stink off them
and take them below.

241
00:28:58,574 --> 00:28:59,784
Pass the word along.

242
00:29:21,264 --> 00:29:24,141
When it's dark,
we'll take them to the small boat...

243
00:29:24,433 --> 00:29:26,477
and row them out to their ship.
Come with me.

244
00:29:39,532 --> 00:29:41,117
Now, you know what the plan is.

245
00:29:41,409 --> 00:29:43,536
The rest will join my lads
at the fishing boats...

246
00:29:43,828 --> 00:29:46,205
and stand by the pirate vessel
to receive the guns.

247
00:29:46,497 --> 00:29:48,457
Suppose the pirates
refuse to give them up?

248
00:29:48,749 --> 00:29:51,335
I'll keep my knife
at Captain Vallo's throat.

249
00:29:51,627 --> 00:29:54,171
Either he'll give the order
to hand over the guns...

250
00:29:54,463 --> 00:29:56,340
or he'll never give another order.

251
00:29:56,632 --> 00:29:59,677
You're cutting our throats,
Pablo Murphy, not his.

252
00:30:03,347 --> 00:30:05,808
I like your nerve, Pablo, but not your plan.

253
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:10,021
I say we've got to get the guns and take
the palace before Baron Gruda gets here.

254
00:30:10,313 --> 00:30:13,733
And I say we need more than guns.
We need El Libre to lead us.

255
00:30:14,025 --> 00:30:16,610
You women won't face facts.
El Libre's been captured.

256
00:30:16,902 --> 00:30:18,571
The way to face facts is to rescue him.

257
00:30:18,863 --> 00:30:21,282
Rescue him?
From the King's prison? Impossible.

258
00:30:23,075 --> 00:30:27,121
Not for a desperate man
with a 30-gunner and a fighting crew.

259
00:30:27,747 --> 00:30:29,874
A pirate rescue for El Libre?

260
00:30:30,249 --> 00:30:33,502
That'd be taking him from the frying pan
and throwing him into the fire.

261
00:30:33,794 --> 00:30:36,047
- We'll handle this our own way.
- About face!

262
00:30:36,339 --> 00:30:37,298
Get over here.

263
00:31:20,132 --> 00:31:21,842
There's a meeting! The door, quick!

264
00:31:38,526 --> 00:31:39,902
Out! The other door!

265
00:32:01,215 --> 00:32:03,717
If I release you, can I count on your help?

266
00:32:05,511 --> 00:32:07,054
You'll be well paid.

267
00:32:25,406 --> 00:32:27,199
You misjudged our men.

268
00:32:27,741 --> 00:32:29,493
Don't misjudge our women.

269
00:32:31,078 --> 00:32:32,580
- Another door here.
- Where?

270
00:32:32,872 --> 00:32:34,081
Follow me.

271
00:33:18,584 --> 00:33:22,004
- What's all the shooting?
- The Skipper coming back from market.

272
00:33:22,296 --> 00:33:24,840
I have a feeling
we'll be putting out to sea.

273
00:33:25,132 --> 00:33:28,802
Hoist anchor. Man all canvas. Look lively!

274
00:33:29,094 --> 00:33:30,930
Man the yards!

275
00:33:35,601 --> 00:33:36,810
Prepare to fire!

276
00:33:42,107 --> 00:33:43,317
Fire one!

277
00:33:52,493 --> 00:33:53,702
Fire two!

278
00:34:09,009 --> 00:34:13,556
Signal Baron Gruda's ship for a broadside.
One of us can knock her out of the water.

279
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:38,330
Shore battery's asking for a broadside
against them, Mr. Bellows.

280
00:34:38,622 --> 00:34:40,916
What are you waiting for, drooling idiot?

281
00:34:41,208 --> 00:34:44,503
- Give 'em a broadside!
- Aye, aye, sir! One broadside coming up!

282
00:35:03,522 --> 00:35:05,441
Good shooting, lads. Well aimed.

283
00:35:06,025 --> 00:35:08,485
Skipper, be that
what thou bought at market?

284
00:35:10,362 --> 00:35:12,573
Take the lady below
and make her comfortable.

285
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:18,078
Thank you, Captain.

286
00:35:20,998 --> 00:35:23,000
The gallant Captain Vallo, eh, lads?

287
00:35:28,797 --> 00:35:30,883
Be that bit of fluff El Libre?

288
00:35:31,175 --> 00:35:33,177
That's the bit of fluff
that's taking us to him.

289
00:35:33,469 --> 00:35:37,431
He's being held on the Island of San Perot,
only a day's sailing from here.

290
00:35:38,891 --> 00:35:40,893
Who's holding him for us, Skipper?

291
00:35:41,185 --> 00:35:45,522
The King's troop. In the military prison.
Now, what could be sweeter, lads?

292
00:35:45,814 --> 00:35:49,485
We'll steal him from the King's men,
and sell him back to a king's man.

293
00:35:50,694 --> 00:35:54,365
- But be thou seriously planning to...
- Walk us into a king's prison?

294
00:35:54,657 --> 00:35:57,451
Why, not at all, Humble Bellows, not at all.

295
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:00,037
Gather round, lads, gather round!

296
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,505
- My, my, what a pretty knife.
- Would you like a closer look?

297
00:36:51,797 --> 00:36:54,258
Let's keep this pot
looking like a ship of the line!

298
00:36:54,967 --> 00:36:56,385
Come up here.

299
00:37:01,849 --> 00:37:03,016
Hop to it!

300
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,652
I came up to talk about El Libre.

301
00:37:18,866 --> 00:37:21,910
- Go ahead. I'm listening.
- You have a plan to save him?

302
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:25,622
A plan and a price.
Guns alone will cost 50,000.

303
00:37:25,914 --> 00:37:29,626
That's a great deal of money for guns.
How much are you asking for El Libre?

304
00:37:30,753 --> 00:37:32,337
Oh, yes, El Libre.

305
00:37:33,172 --> 00:37:34,715
I'll throw him in for nothing.

306
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,676
Very well, Captain.

307
00:37:37,968 --> 00:37:40,220
I'll see that the money
is arranged with him.

308
00:37:40,512 --> 00:37:42,848
You may be sure
that he'll honor the agreement.

309
00:37:43,849 --> 00:37:45,184
What's your plan?

310
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:52,149
Why did you bolt
your cabin door last night?

311
00:37:52,524 --> 00:37:55,110
If you know it was bolted,
you must've tried it.

312
00:37:55,402 --> 00:37:57,780
And if you tried it,
you know why it was bolted.

313
00:38:00,908 --> 00:38:02,868
How do you propose to get El Libre?

314
00:38:03,535 --> 00:38:05,412
Is your door open only to him?

315
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:07,873
What do you mean?

316
00:38:08,165 --> 00:38:11,627
So much concern about one man
can't be entirely political.

317
00:38:12,252 --> 00:38:13,754
He's your lover.

318
00:38:14,379 --> 00:38:15,339
No.

319
00:38:16,173 --> 00:38:17,633
He's my father.

320
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:20,719
Captain!

321
00:38:25,349 --> 00:38:26,725
Land ho!

322
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,577
On your feet, lads. Attention!

323
00:38:51,333 --> 00:38:53,919
You're supposed to be king's men,
not bard slabs.

324
00:38:54,211 --> 00:38:56,296
Look like you belong in those uniforms.

325
00:39:09,268 --> 00:39:12,396
Ojo, signal to the garrison
that Baron Gruda has arrived...

326
00:39:12,855 --> 00:39:14,481
to take El Libre into custody.

327
00:39:27,202 --> 00:39:30,122
- What about my father?
- I ordered you to stay below.

328
00:39:32,624 --> 00:39:34,501
What are they signaling?

329
00:39:36,503 --> 00:39:39,923
The garrison commander wishes
to give a dinner in honor of Baron Gruda.

330
00:39:40,966 --> 00:39:42,843
What are we going to do?

331
00:39:44,177 --> 00:39:46,513
We're going to accept, of course.

332
00:40:24,426 --> 00:40:26,136
Baron Gruda and his bit of fluff...

333
00:40:26,428 --> 00:40:29,431
left enough clothes on board
to fool the King himself.

334
00:40:29,723 --> 00:40:31,099
If anyone recognizes us...

335
00:40:31,391 --> 00:40:34,394
we'll be stripping for action
and taking El Libre the hard way.

336
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:45,322
A fine body of men, Captain.
A fine body of men.

337
00:41:18,981 --> 00:41:22,901
His Excellency Baron Gruda and party.

338
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:41,420
Welcome, Your Excellency.

339
00:41:41,712 --> 00:41:44,923
It is a great honor for all of us
to meet you at last.

340
00:41:45,215 --> 00:41:48,051
It gives us great pleasure
that you accept our hospitality.

341
00:41:48,343 --> 00:41:50,971
On the contrary, my dear Colonel,
it is I who am accepted.

342
00:41:51,263 --> 00:41:54,016
Oh, no, Your Excellency.
I am the lucky one.

343
00:41:54,933 --> 00:41:59,312
I had instructions from the Governor
of Cobra to execute El Libre.

344
00:42:00,147 --> 00:42:03,066
I was on the verge of doing so
when I got your message.

345
00:42:03,358 --> 00:42:06,069
The Governor is an idiot!
I may replace him...

346
00:42:07,446 --> 00:42:08,697
with a military man.

347
00:42:09,531 --> 00:42:12,451
- My dear Baron.
- My dear Colonel.

348
00:42:18,123 --> 00:42:21,251
- May I introduce you to our guests?
- By all means.

349
00:42:32,471 --> 00:42:34,848
- Your Excellency.
- Your Excellency.

350
00:43:01,958 --> 00:43:05,295
But I have so much trouble
collecting the King's taxes here.

351
00:43:05,587 --> 00:43:08,465
Tell me, Count.
How do the people pay at home?

352
00:43:11,968 --> 00:43:14,638
Through the nose!
They pay through the nose!

353
00:43:16,431 --> 00:43:18,183
That's really very good!

354
00:43:22,479 --> 00:43:24,606
How long do we have to play this game?

355
00:43:26,691 --> 00:43:29,152
Till the Colonel decides
to hand over El Libre.

356
00:43:29,444 --> 00:43:30,862
I am frightened.

357
00:43:55,637 --> 00:43:57,681
The Count must be
a constant delight to you.

358
00:43:57,973 --> 00:44:00,058
He's really too funny for words.

359
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:01,351
Indeed he is.

360
00:44:01,643 --> 00:44:02,769
Do tell us, Count.

361
00:44:03,061 --> 00:44:06,273
What does the Queen wear
when she goes out these days?

362
00:44:08,567 --> 00:44:11,486
The Count always says
the Queen wears the King out.

363
00:44:11,945 --> 00:44:13,780
You are the wittiest man!

364
00:44:17,075 --> 00:44:20,662
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention, please.

365
00:44:22,038 --> 00:44:25,959
To commemorate the honor
Baron Gruda has done us by his visit...

366
00:44:26,543 --> 00:44:31,131
the officers of the Saint Theo garrison
have arranged a little gift for him.

367
00:44:32,465 --> 00:44:34,968
Will everyone come this way, please?

368
00:44:49,733 --> 00:44:50,734
On the left...

369
00:44:51,026 --> 00:44:55,488
you have that great lover of democracy
and the people, El Libre.

370
00:44:56,072 --> 00:44:59,117
And on the right,
that distinguished scientist...

371
00:44:59,409 --> 00:45:01,286
Professor Prudence.

372
00:45:02,037 --> 00:45:04,372
Both caught like rats in a trap...

373
00:45:04,664 --> 00:45:08,793
conspiring against the greater glory
of His Majesty.

374
00:45:09,628 --> 00:45:12,839
But thanks to statesmen
like Baron Gruda...

375
00:45:13,465 --> 00:45:17,886
such men and such ideas
will soon be destroyed.

376
00:45:18,929 --> 00:45:20,513
As a distinguished scientist...

377
00:45:20,805 --> 00:45:25,060
I can assure you an idea has no physical
properties which can be destroyed.

378
00:45:25,352 --> 00:45:28,063
As a lover of democracy and the people,
I can assure you...

379
00:45:28,355 --> 00:45:30,565
both will survive your puny efforts.

380
00:45:31,942 --> 00:45:35,403
As a statesman, I can assure you
that no one can foretell the future.

381
00:45:35,695 --> 00:45:39,074
However, your fate at present
is as clear to me...

382
00:45:39,783 --> 00:45:42,244
as the face of this beautiful lady
at my side.

383
00:45:42,535 --> 00:45:43,745
Bravo!

384
00:45:44,037 --> 00:45:46,581
Thank you, Your Excellency.

385
00:45:51,253 --> 00:45:54,172
Yes. She is very beautiful.

386
00:45:55,799 --> 00:45:57,509
His Excellency has a point.

387
00:45:57,801 --> 00:46:01,680
It's foolish to quarrel with fate
when ours is so clearly in his hands.

388
00:46:03,348 --> 00:46:07,269
Take them outside and hold them
for Baron Gruda's pleasure.

389
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:15,568
My dear Colonel, thank you
for a most rewarding evening.

390
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:18,655
- And now we must go.
- It is by no means over.

391
00:46:18,947 --> 00:46:21,449
I've arranged
a very special entertainment...

392
00:46:21,741 --> 00:46:23,660
for this very special occasion.

393
00:46:46,349 --> 00:46:48,435
It's that dame we held for ransom.

394
00:46:59,529 --> 00:47:00,530
Abandon ship.

395
00:47:00,822 --> 00:47:03,658
- Thank you, my dear Colonel.
- Your Excellency!

396
00:47:04,284 --> 00:47:07,746
- But, my dear Baron!
- Wonderful evening, Colonel.

397
00:47:08,038 --> 00:47:08,997
Vallo!

398
00:47:15,211 --> 00:47:16,296
But, Your Excellency.

399
00:47:16,588 --> 00:47:20,133
Unexpected international affairs.
Happens to us diplomats all the time.

400
00:47:24,471 --> 00:47:26,848
- Put the prisoners in my carriage.
- Aye, aye, sir.

401
00:47:34,606 --> 00:47:37,609
I do hope the King will hear about this,
Your Excellency.

402
00:47:37,901 --> 00:47:39,110
Don't worry, he will.

403
00:47:40,695 --> 00:47:43,531
Unclutch me, you polluted shrimp.

404
00:47:46,451 --> 00:47:48,161
Stop him, you fools!

405
00:47:48,661 --> 00:47:50,705
He's the Crimson Pirate!

406
00:47:50,997 --> 00:47:52,540
The Crimson Pirate?

407
00:48:00,799 --> 00:48:03,468
The Crimson Pirate!

408
00:48:05,637 --> 00:48:07,555
Take the Colonel to safety. Quick, man.

409
00:48:09,641 --> 00:48:12,852
- Take the Colonel to safety!
- Let me go, you fools!

410
00:48:14,145 --> 00:48:16,773
Don't worry, Colonel.
I'll take care of everything!

411
00:48:17,065 --> 00:48:19,984
- Citizen Ravel, save the Count!
- Save the Count!

412
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:31,579
- Sire! Sire!
- Good work, Captain.

413
00:48:31,955 --> 00:48:34,541
Stop him! There's the Crimson Pirate!

414
00:48:35,208 --> 00:48:36,376
Captain!

415
00:48:38,169 --> 00:48:40,338
The officers are mutinying. Crush them!

416
00:48:41,714 --> 00:48:43,383
Crush them! Come on!

417
00:48:45,093 --> 00:48:46,386
Sound the attack!

418
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:53,143
Hold the fort. Don't give an inch.
Protect the women and children.

419
00:48:53,435 --> 00:48:56,187
Reinforcements are on the way.
Lock the gates! Let no one out.

420
00:48:56,479 --> 00:48:58,273
Lock the gates! Let no one out!

421
00:48:58,565 --> 00:49:01,693
Long live the King!

422
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:08,533
I don't think we've met.
My name is Prudence.

423
00:49:08,825 --> 00:49:10,910
Captain Vallo, at your service.

424
00:49:13,121 --> 00:49:14,372
Thank you.

425
00:49:46,863 --> 00:49:48,740
What are you grinning at?

426
00:49:53,912 --> 00:49:56,915
So, I'm getting a halo.
You're afraid I'm getting soft.

427
00:49:57,874 --> 00:49:59,501
Yeah, you're wrong.

428
00:50:01,252 --> 00:50:05,340
It's just that this is a new kind of caper.
These people are getting on my nerves.

429
00:50:06,049 --> 00:50:08,301
El Libre and his daughter
are strictly business.

430
00:50:10,053 --> 00:50:13,264
They haven't got me chained.
I've got them chained.

431
00:50:14,057 --> 00:50:16,059
I'll be rid of them soon enough.

432
00:50:16,351 --> 00:50:18,978
Tomorrow, I'm delivering them
to Baron Gruda personally.

433
00:50:20,355 --> 00:50:21,981
What are you talking about?

434
00:50:48,007 --> 00:50:49,217
The girl?

435
00:50:53,930 --> 00:50:55,181
What about the girl?

436
00:50:59,310 --> 00:51:00,937
She's getting under my skin.

437
00:51:02,146 --> 00:51:04,148
She's putting crazy ideas in my head.

438
00:51:04,983 --> 00:51:09,070
She's unlocked my heart.
She's getting too close to me.

439
00:51:10,655 --> 00:51:12,031
She's got me hooked.

440
00:51:14,242 --> 00:51:15,535
She's blind.

441
00:51:16,828 --> 00:51:18,746
I'm blind. You're blind.

442
00:51:19,789 --> 00:51:21,040
Who's blind?

443
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:26,045
Oh! Love is blind.

444
00:51:28,006 --> 00:51:29,549
I am not in love!

445
00:52:16,638 --> 00:52:17,930
Avast there!

446
00:52:19,807 --> 00:52:23,019
I told you not to make so much noise.
Now the Skipper will get her.

447
00:52:23,311 --> 00:52:25,229
- He always does.
- Nobody will get her.

448
00:52:32,612 --> 00:52:34,155
Untie the others. Move!

449
00:52:34,447 --> 00:52:36,032
What's up? I'm having a little fun.

450
00:52:36,324 --> 00:52:39,577
- Come on, Skipper. Let us have some fun.
- You want her all to yourself?

451
00:52:39,869 --> 00:52:42,872
- Why don't you join the fun?
- Why don't you try yourself?

452
00:52:43,164 --> 00:52:46,626
- You always tell that you couldn't make it.
- Always work and no fun.

453
00:52:59,847 --> 00:53:03,309
Mr. Bellows, take all three below
and bring me the cabin keys.

454
00:53:03,601 --> 00:53:06,020
If you'll forgive
my pointing it out, Skipper...

455
00:53:06,312 --> 00:53:09,482
we can't leave a pretty woman
unmolested aboard ship.

456
00:53:10,024 --> 00:53:12,193
It will give piracy a bad name.

457
00:53:12,485 --> 00:53:14,195
Are you challenging my orders?

458
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:18,157
I'd never do that, Skipper...

459
00:53:18,491 --> 00:53:22,328
but seeing thou is selling these pigeons
to Baron Gruda anyway...

460
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:26,249
I thought there could be no harm
to sport with them a bit first.

461
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,669
No offense, Skipper.

462
00:53:44,726 --> 00:53:47,812
I'm putting you ashore tomorrow at Cobra
and giving you the guns.

463
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:50,273
All of you.

464
00:53:52,066 --> 00:53:53,735
Just don't thank me.

465
00:54:32,857 --> 00:54:34,025
Skipper.

466
00:54:43,201 --> 00:54:46,287
Yes, there's our ship.
With Baron Gruda waiting.

467
00:54:46,871 --> 00:54:48,664
Won't he hate paying for El Libre...

468
00:54:48,956 --> 00:54:52,502
when he finds out we stole him
out of one of the King's own prisons?

469
00:54:55,713 --> 00:54:58,019
We'll heave to onto the
point till nightfall.

470
00:54:58,219 --> 00:54:59,425
Aye, aye, Skipper.

471
00:55:04,514 --> 00:55:05,598
Slimey.

472
00:55:15,817 --> 00:55:19,987
- Let's see thee swim to yonder island.
- Aye, and back again.

473
00:55:20,571 --> 00:55:24,283
If my plan works,
Baron Gruda himself will escort thee back.

474
00:55:24,826 --> 00:55:26,786
I've a message for thee to give to him.

475
00:55:27,286 --> 00:55:29,872
Do it, and when I am skipper...

476
00:55:30,164 --> 00:55:31,791
thou wilt be first mate.

477
00:55:35,336 --> 00:55:36,754
Mr. Bellows...

478
00:55:38,881 --> 00:55:41,926
- what about sharks?
- They never attack a man.

479
00:55:42,677 --> 00:55:44,804
Unless he attacks them first.

480
00:55:55,690 --> 00:55:57,358
- Governor.
- Baron?

481
00:55:58,150 --> 00:56:01,696
- Send him to the kitchen and feed him.
- Kitchen. Feed him.

482
00:56:04,991 --> 00:56:07,368
You'll have the 100,000 gold florin
ready for them.

483
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:09,745
Whatever Your Excellency orders.

484
00:56:10,037 --> 00:56:13,583
- But this is sheer piracy.
- I assure you...

485
00:56:13,875 --> 00:56:17,378
I shall have El Libre, his daughter,
his distinguished conspirator...

486
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:21,883
our ship, our guns, the pirates,
and Captain Vallo, without paying a sou.

487
00:56:22,258 --> 00:56:25,344
- Then why 100,000?
- Have the money ready, I said.

488
00:56:27,305 --> 00:56:31,142
The first mate thinks he can undo Vallo,
but his plan may fail.

489
00:56:32,059 --> 00:56:35,521
Even if we have to pay, such a haul
would be cheap at double the price.

490
00:56:35,813 --> 00:56:37,106
By the way...

491
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:40,860
I shall want a barrel of this, well drugged.

492
00:56:49,327 --> 00:56:51,287
- You disposed of Captain Vallo?
- No.

493
00:56:51,579 --> 00:56:54,457
It will be necessary to expose him
to the crew first.

494
00:56:54,749 --> 00:56:58,544
Which I'll be doing soon enough,
if thou has followed my instructions.

495
00:56:58,836 --> 00:57:00,171
To the letter.

496
00:57:00,588 --> 00:57:03,341
And the money?
If you'll forgive my impatience.

497
00:57:03,633 --> 00:57:05,593
It will be waiting for you in the morning.

498
00:57:05,885 --> 00:57:08,930
Meanwhile, I place myself in your hands
as security for it.

499
00:57:09,221 --> 00:57:10,348
Very well.

500
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:14,060
But I remind thee, they be murderous
hands when they're empty.

501
00:57:15,853 --> 00:57:17,772
Hide His Excellency below.

502
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:53,015
As soon as it's clear topside,
Ojo will stand by below with a small boat.

503
00:57:53,307 --> 00:57:56,143
It's a short pull to shore.
Call your father.

504
00:58:29,844 --> 00:58:32,179
Come with us. Join us.

505
00:58:34,348 --> 00:58:35,266
No.

506
00:58:37,226 --> 00:58:40,021
But you want to. I know you want to.

507
00:58:41,272 --> 00:58:42,648
You're wrong.

508
00:58:43,607 --> 00:58:46,527
There's nothing in it for me.
Get your father.

509
00:58:51,407 --> 00:58:53,325
Then why are you setting us free?

510
00:58:53,617 --> 00:58:56,787
- I keep my promises, even foolish ones.
- You made no promise.

511
00:58:57,079 --> 00:58:59,999
You made a deal to sell us,
and you can't do it.

512
00:59:00,416 --> 00:59:04,170
All right, then. I'm doing it for you.
Let's leave it at that.

513
00:59:05,254 --> 00:59:08,007
No, Vallo. We can't leave it at that.

514
00:59:08,841 --> 00:59:11,093
You're a fighter. Fight with us.

515
00:59:11,761 --> 00:59:14,096
- Fight for something decent.
- Not I.

516
00:59:14,764 --> 00:59:18,726
All my life I've watched injustice
and dishonesty fly the flag of decency.

517
00:59:19,018 --> 00:59:21,729
- I don't trust them.
- Don't you trust me?

518
00:59:24,857 --> 00:59:27,651
Don't you trust what we have
for each other?

519
00:59:27,943 --> 00:59:31,072
What we have for each other
we'll have to get over.

520
00:59:33,574 --> 00:59:34,700
Can we?

521
00:59:53,135 --> 00:59:55,429
You're right. I won't let you go.

522
00:59:56,514 --> 01:00:00,226
We belong together here,
aboard my ship. We'll find a way.

523
01:00:02,603 --> 01:00:03,896
But that's not possible.

524
01:00:05,231 --> 01:00:09,276
- I can't stay here. Don't you see?
- Yes, I see.

525
01:00:10,778 --> 01:00:13,030
And now, at last, you see it, too.

526
01:00:13,989 --> 01:00:16,700
You've got your world, and I've got mine.

527
01:00:22,123 --> 01:00:23,833
All right, gentlemen.

528
01:00:27,461 --> 01:00:28,629
Sit down.

529
01:00:30,756 --> 01:00:33,467
Professor, you'll go ashore later
with Pablo Murphy and the guns.

530
01:00:33,759 --> 01:00:36,387
- Right.
- Keep talking to yourself, loudly.

531
01:00:36,679 --> 01:00:38,931
I want my men to think
you're all still here.

532
01:00:39,223 --> 01:00:41,058
That's no problem for me.

533
01:00:41,350 --> 01:00:43,978
Now, remember, this is a dangerous game.

534
01:00:44,270 --> 01:00:47,606
If my men tumble to it,
they'll slit your throats, and mine, too.

535
01:00:47,898 --> 01:00:49,692
I don't like it, Captain.

536
01:00:50,234 --> 01:00:53,654
We can't leave you to face them alone.
Come with us.

537
01:00:54,822 --> 01:00:55,990
Father...

538
01:00:56,615 --> 01:00:57,575
don't.

539
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:46,248
Avast! Man the guns!

540
01:01:54,089 --> 01:01:55,758
Topside, you swabs!

541
01:02:10,272 --> 01:02:11,315
Help!

542
01:02:16,987 --> 01:02:20,282
Not so fast, Skipper,
if you'll pardon the intrusion.

543
01:02:40,803 --> 01:02:44,223
You've sold me, Humble Bellows,
and to a king's flunky.

544
01:02:44,515 --> 01:02:45,391
Aye.

545
01:02:45,975 --> 01:02:49,561
'Tis my modest opinion
that no man can fly pirate's colors...

546
01:02:49,853 --> 01:02:53,649
who's not willing to sell his friend,
his sweetheart, or his mother.

547
01:02:53,941 --> 01:02:56,777
- Well spoken, Mr. Bellows.
- Foul spoken it is.

548
01:02:57,236 --> 01:02:59,655
You've turned your hand
against your Captain's back.

549
01:02:59,947 --> 01:03:01,824
Yellow was never a pirate's color.

550
01:03:02,116 --> 01:03:04,827
Nor rescuing a fair maiden a pirate caper.

551
01:03:05,703 --> 01:03:06,704
Aye.

552
01:03:07,579 --> 01:03:10,249
It's true. I sailed beyond my depth...

553
01:03:11,834 --> 01:03:14,586
but only to sound out new waters
for the lot of us.

554
01:03:14,878 --> 01:03:18,924
If we'd have starved to death,
I'd have never sold a man jack of you.

555
01:03:21,385 --> 01:03:25,180
Gather round, lads.
This isn't the last of the pirate capers.

556
01:03:25,472 --> 01:03:28,100
'Tis the last of thee and of thy capers...

557
01:03:28,642 --> 01:03:32,813
for 'twas put to the vote whilst thee
was trying to deprive us of our loot.

558
01:03:33,105 --> 01:03:36,984
Ye violated the pirate code
by letting a fat fish off the hook.

559
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:41,238
By vote of all,
ye are deprived of command...

560
01:03:41,739 --> 01:03:45,909
and sentenced under piratical law
to be cast adrift in a small boat...

561
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:48,454
without food or water.

562
01:03:51,165 --> 01:03:55,127
A splendid decision, Mr. Bellows.
Quick justice and certain death.

563
01:03:56,045 --> 01:04:00,299
Perhaps you'd save the King the expense
of hanging this learned fool...

564
01:04:00,591 --> 01:04:02,468
and let him keep Captain Vallo company.

565
01:04:03,844 --> 01:04:05,888
Thou hast a generous choice.

566
01:04:06,263 --> 01:04:08,098
The gallows or the sea.

567
01:04:16,565 --> 01:04:18,317
If it won't crowd you.

568
01:04:20,402 --> 01:04:23,947
I'd rather you weren't coming,
but I don't want to seem inhospitable.

569
01:04:25,783 --> 01:04:27,159
As for thee...

570
01:04:28,619 --> 01:04:32,289
since I have no voice to raise against
thy Captain's misdemeanors...

571
01:04:32,581 --> 01:04:36,168
thee will be pardoned by giving thy hand
to thy new skipper.

572
01:04:36,543 --> 01:04:39,755
What say thee? Shall we loose thy bonds?

573
01:04:51,517 --> 01:04:52,935
Cut him loose.

574
01:05:28,762 --> 01:05:31,557
It's done, Skipper. We set them adrift.

575
01:05:32,141 --> 01:05:34,893
The morning tide
will take them out to sea.

576
01:05:45,112 --> 01:05:48,282
Wait! This calls for a celebration,
eh, Mr. Bellows?

577
01:05:48,782 --> 01:05:52,661
I've a keg of rum aboard my boat.
Straight from the Governor's own cellar.

578
01:05:52,953 --> 01:05:54,037
What say?

579
01:05:55,706 --> 01:05:56,707
Aye.

580
01:05:57,166 --> 01:05:58,584
I could use a drink.

581
01:05:59,084 --> 01:06:01,420
Come on, lads! Get the rum aboard.

582
01:06:05,007 --> 01:06:07,342
Bring mine to the Captain's cabin.

583
01:06:13,474 --> 01:06:16,351
There's the end of land.
The end of our world.

584
01:06:16,643 --> 01:06:19,271
From now on, it's starve, thirst,
and finally capsize.

585
01:06:19,938 --> 01:06:22,274
I've been meditating on just that.

586
01:06:22,774 --> 01:06:26,862
Capsizing is the solution of our problem.
There's no doubt about it.

587
01:06:28,113 --> 01:06:30,699
- If you'll follow me, please.
- Sit down, you fool!

588
01:06:34,161 --> 01:06:35,537
Sit down, you...

589
01:07:07,319 --> 01:07:08,487
It works.

590
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:11,865
Good old Aristotle.

591
01:07:12,157 --> 01:07:14,326
Over 2,000 years ago, he wrote:

592
01:07:14,618 --> 01:07:18,247
"A metallic vessel will retain air
underwater without filling."

593
01:07:18,539 --> 01:07:21,041
But I myself have done some research
on the subject...

594
01:07:21,333 --> 01:07:24,545
while designing a craft
which I call an undersea boat.

595
01:07:24,836 --> 01:07:28,507
- How did you know this was airtight?
- In science, my son...

596
01:07:29,132 --> 01:07:31,802
one knows nothing until one experiments.

597
01:07:33,095 --> 01:07:35,847
We may now conclude
that we are breathing.

598
01:07:36,139 --> 01:07:38,433
Let us walk ashore as quickly as possible.

599
01:07:38,725 --> 01:07:42,020
I compute there's sufficient air
to last us several minutes.

600
01:07:42,312 --> 01:07:44,982
Providing we don't waste
our oxygen talking, of course.

601
01:07:45,274 --> 01:07:47,651
- All right, then. Shut up!
- Quite so.

602
01:09:55,404 --> 01:09:59,366
You needn't have brought out
the whole garrison. I did the job myself.

603
01:09:59,658 --> 01:10:02,160
They won't be so playful
when they wake up this time.

604
01:10:02,452 --> 01:10:04,246
All right. Wake them up.

605
01:10:04,579 --> 01:10:06,665
Sober them up
and take them to the pirate ship.

606
01:10:06,957 --> 01:10:08,542
Over the side with them!

607
01:10:37,446 --> 01:10:40,282
Sorry I be for this, mates.
And I humbly apologize.

608
01:10:40,574 --> 01:10:43,201
'Twould never have happened
with Vallo as skipper.

609
01:10:43,618 --> 01:10:46,496
He violated a pirate code
and he had to go.

610
01:10:46,997 --> 01:10:50,125
But he went like a pirate.
We're going like fish.

611
01:10:50,417 --> 01:10:52,919
I can't forgive myself for that.

612
01:10:54,296 --> 01:10:57,507
King's flunky made a monkey
of Humble Bellows.

613
01:10:57,966 --> 01:11:00,635
- Pirate of the old school.
- Enough of that!

614
01:11:00,927 --> 01:11:02,137
Hoist them!

615
01:11:08,268 --> 01:11:10,771
Put a crew aboard this ship
and have her re-canvased.

616
01:11:11,062 --> 01:11:13,523
I want her ready to sail when I leave.

617
01:11:13,899 --> 01:11:17,319
Give them just enough bread
and water to keep them alive.

618
01:11:17,611 --> 01:11:20,280
They'll fetch a good bounty from the King.

619
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:57,108
Ahoy. Pablo Murphy.

620
01:11:58,819 --> 01:12:01,071
- Well, I'll be...
- Get us out of these chains.

621
01:12:01,363 --> 01:12:04,324
After all you got us into,
you lying blabbermouth?

622
01:12:04,616 --> 01:12:06,368
Get yourself out of it.

623
01:12:19,256 --> 01:12:22,384
- Pablo Murphy.
- For the last time, get away from us.

624
01:12:22,968 --> 01:12:25,428
Get it through that head of yours,
I didn't sell El Libre.

625
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:28,348
- Let me assure...
- We can see for ourselves what he's done.

626
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:31,184
If we'd gone my way,
El Libre wouldn't be dead.

627
01:12:31,476 --> 01:12:33,520
Consuelo wouldn't be held captive
in the palace...

628
01:12:33,812 --> 01:12:36,523
and we'd have guns to stop Gruda's men
from crushing us.

629
01:12:36,815 --> 01:12:38,859
Hold it, gentlemen. Soldiers.

630
01:12:48,076 --> 01:12:52,330
By order of Baron Gruda, all fishing
will be done under armed escort.

631
01:12:52,664 --> 01:12:54,916
The entire catch to be turned over
to the Governor.

632
01:12:55,208 --> 01:12:57,294
- What'll be left for us?
- The bait.

633
01:12:57,711 --> 01:12:59,504
In that case, we'll do no fishing.

634
01:13:01,756 --> 01:13:03,425
Any more objections?

635
01:13:04,718 --> 01:13:07,762
The rest of you proceed
to the Governor's dock. Get moving!

636
01:13:09,264 --> 01:13:11,182
Take him to the fortress.

637
01:13:26,114 --> 01:13:27,324
This way.

638
01:14:10,033 --> 01:14:13,036
- Hey, there, back in line.
- Follow those boats.

639
01:14:47,779 --> 01:14:49,072
After them!

640
01:16:10,987 --> 01:16:12,155
Let's go.

641
01:16:44,687 --> 01:16:47,816
- Is everything arranged?
- Just as you ordered, Excellency.

642
01:16:48,108 --> 01:16:51,402
You've broken the back of the rebellion
overnight. The King owes you much.

643
01:16:51,694 --> 01:16:53,741
He will pay it. I may
even be able to collect

644
01:16:53,941 --> 01:16:55,615
the full bounty on Captain Vallo...

645
01:16:55,907 --> 01:16:59,619
for he was killed by his own men
while trying to save El Libre.

646
01:17:03,873 --> 01:17:05,750
Don't be upset, my dear.

647
01:17:06,209 --> 01:17:09,754
You'll form new attachments here.
You're to marry the Governor.

648
01:17:10,046 --> 01:17:12,590
After I'm gone,
you'll rule through her, Governor.

649
01:17:12,882 --> 01:17:14,696
You'll order your people
to till their fields

650
01:17:14,896 --> 01:17:15,844
and fish their seas...

651
01:17:16,136 --> 01:17:17,679
for the greater glory of the King.

652
01:17:17,971 --> 01:17:20,557
- I'd die first.
- No, you'll die last.

653
01:17:21,015 --> 01:17:23,935
First you'll watch your people go
one by one.

654
01:17:42,579 --> 01:17:44,330
Someday I'll kill you.

655
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:47,167
Officer!

656
01:17:53,506 --> 01:17:55,425
These methods will bring her round soon.

657
01:17:55,717 --> 01:17:58,261
I shouldn't like her to kill herself
before she marries.

658
01:17:58,553 --> 01:18:02,390
She's not the type. She'll marry you
and wait for a chance to poison you.

659
01:18:02,682 --> 01:18:05,894
It doesn't sound like an ideal marriage.
Couldn't we dispense with that?

660
01:18:06,186 --> 01:18:08,354
Too much of it upsets my liver.

661
01:18:10,398 --> 01:18:14,152
It's not your liver. It's your heart.
It's much too soft.

662
01:18:17,488 --> 01:18:19,866
Tonight the people bury El Libre.

663
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:23,411
I want a proclamation posted
in the path of the funeral procession...

664
01:18:23,703 --> 01:18:26,039
announcing your marriage
to the daughter of El Libre.

665
01:18:26,331 --> 01:18:27,498
Excellency!

666
01:18:28,291 --> 01:18:31,878
People will be required to attend
and provide entertainment...

667
01:18:32,170 --> 01:18:33,755
to make it a day of rejoicing.

668
01:18:34,047 --> 01:18:36,132
We'll have them fill
the royal grain warehouse...

669
01:18:36,424 --> 01:18:38,593
with 10,000 sacks of grain as a present.

670
01:18:39,177 --> 01:18:40,845
You're learning fast.

671
01:18:41,137 --> 01:18:45,558
After the ceremony, I'll leave you
my troops and my blessings, and depart.

672
01:18:47,477 --> 01:18:51,898
Except for the late, lamented Vallo,
this has been a most boring assignment.

673
01:19:02,742 --> 01:19:06,287
On your way, pig! Amnesty
has been declared for all prisoners.

674
01:19:06,579 --> 01:19:09,958
Baron Gruda will give you a chance
to show allegiance at the wedding.

675
01:19:11,167 --> 01:19:12,293
Gruda.

676
01:19:14,087 --> 01:19:16,547
Gruda, someday I'll kill you.

677
01:19:17,674 --> 01:19:19,050
I'll kill you!

678
01:19:21,344 --> 01:19:24,764
- So it's a marriage now, is it?
- Consuelo will never do it.

679
01:19:25,056 --> 01:19:27,642
Look! 10,000 sacks of grain
for the Governor.

680
01:19:27,934 --> 01:19:29,060
Not mine!

681
01:19:29,519 --> 01:19:31,396
So we're to rejoice, are we?

682
01:19:45,410 --> 01:19:48,371
Baron Gruda has made
the defacing of public property...

683
01:19:48,663 --> 01:19:50,707
an offense punishable by death...

684
01:19:50,999 --> 01:19:53,668
both for the culprit and the accomplices.

685
01:19:54,085 --> 01:19:56,337
Sergeant, round up these people.

686
01:20:25,908 --> 01:20:29,120
- What are you going to do about it?
- It's no concern of mine.

687
01:20:37,754 --> 01:20:40,965
- What are you going to do about her?
- Get her out of it, somehow.

688
01:20:41,466 --> 01:20:43,801
Alone, against 1,000 troops?

689
01:20:44,427 --> 01:20:46,512
- There must be a way.
- There is.

690
01:20:46,804 --> 01:20:49,724
It's a question of simple logic.
We need allies.

691
01:20:50,224 --> 01:20:52,727
These people need freedom.
Let's help them get it.

692
01:20:53,019 --> 01:20:55,313
The only freedom
I'm interested in is Consuelo's.

693
01:20:55,605 --> 01:20:58,566
She'll never consent to be free
until her people are free.

694
01:20:58,858 --> 01:21:00,068
Impossible.

695
01:21:00,777 --> 01:21:03,279
They don't have a chance
against Gruda's crack troops.

696
01:21:03,571 --> 01:21:06,407
Science has learned
that nothing is impossible.

697
01:21:06,699 --> 01:21:10,411
Not long ago, I saw a ship
sailing through the skies of France...

698
01:21:10,703 --> 01:21:14,665
supported by a great bag filled with air
that was lighter than air.

699
01:21:15,416 --> 01:21:19,545
A friend of mine has invented a liquid
that can blast away mountains.

700
01:21:20,088 --> 01:21:24,217
I have completed plans for a boat
that can sail underneath the water.

701
01:21:24,967 --> 01:21:26,594
Who knows what we may accomplish...

702
01:21:26,886 --> 01:21:29,806
against the outdated Baron Gruda
and his outdated world?

703
01:21:30,098 --> 01:21:32,183
All we need is the help of these people...

704
01:21:32,475 --> 01:21:37,188
a little imagination, and deft fingers
with which to steal a few basic materials.

705
01:22:03,423 --> 01:22:05,049
The Baron thinks we're finished.

706
01:22:05,341 --> 01:22:07,677
We're going to let him go on thinking so.

707
01:22:07,969 --> 01:22:10,471
We'll fill the royal grain warehouse
as ordered.

708
01:22:10,763 --> 01:22:12,849
But with the seeds
of the Professor's genius.

709
01:22:13,141 --> 01:22:16,227
- I beg your pardon?
- The Baron has the most weapons.

710
01:22:16,519 --> 01:22:17,812
But we'll have the newest.

711
01:22:18,104 --> 01:22:21,065
An explosive that moves mountains.
A ship that flies through the air.

712
01:22:21,357 --> 01:22:24,986
A ship that flies through the air
by next Sunday? Impossible.

713
01:22:25,611 --> 01:22:27,321
A great man once said to me:

714
01:22:27,613 --> 01:22:29,949
"Science has learned
that nothing is impossible."

715
01:22:33,411 --> 01:22:35,580
Gather round, lads and lasses.

716
01:22:36,122 --> 01:22:40,460
We'll show your fighters and workers
new ways to get rid of old enemies.

717
01:23:34,096 --> 01:23:35,932
It doesn't smell right.

718
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:40,228
10,000 sacks of grain have been brought
into the warehouse.

719
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:42,396
The tunnel to smuggle them out
is complete.

720
01:23:42,688 --> 01:23:45,816
The island is making headway
with the modern weapons to smuggle in...

721
01:23:46,108 --> 01:23:48,152
and still you stand and stir...

722
01:23:48,444 --> 01:23:50,196
that stew with no result.

723
01:23:50,488 --> 01:23:53,074
My friend sent me no formula to go on...

724
01:23:53,366 --> 01:23:56,744
simply the ingredients.
Principally nitrogen and glycerin.

725
01:23:57,036 --> 01:23:59,330
Anyway, I'm not really sure
I want to discover it.

726
01:23:59,622 --> 01:24:03,125
If it can remove a mountain,
how do I know it won't remove an island?

727
01:24:03,417 --> 01:24:06,295
"In science, one knows nothing
unless one experiments."

728
01:24:06,587 --> 01:24:08,631
I wish you'd stop quoting me.

729
01:24:15,638 --> 01:24:17,390
That's it.

730
01:24:25,314 --> 01:24:26,524
Soldiers!

731
01:24:29,819 --> 01:24:31,737
Don't fall down with that.

732
01:24:32,071 --> 01:24:33,906
Even if they shoot you.

733
01:25:04,145 --> 01:25:06,939
Be careful you don't over-inflate this
in the morning.

734
01:25:07,356 --> 01:25:09,734
We've cut the wall braces
to the breaking point.

735
01:25:10,026 --> 01:25:13,029
But we don't want them to collapse
before the signal.

736
01:25:13,321 --> 01:25:14,238
Remember...

737
01:25:14,530 --> 01:25:18,326
there'll be no signal given till Consuelo's
gotten safely away from Baron Gruda.

738
01:25:25,124 --> 01:25:26,250
Careful.

739
01:25:33,215 --> 01:25:34,925
The liquid explosive.

740
01:25:36,636 --> 01:25:40,181
- Is that all that's left?
- I've improved a bit on the formula.

741
01:25:40,473 --> 01:25:42,808
This is concentrated 1,000 times.

742
01:25:53,402 --> 01:25:54,570
Please.

743
01:26:35,152 --> 01:26:38,656
The royal grain warehouse is reported
full to capacity, Your Excellency.

744
01:26:38,948 --> 01:26:41,617
Amazing how you brought them
to their knees.

745
01:26:41,909 --> 01:26:46,080
Spare the rod and spoil the child.
Never forget that, my dear Governor.

746
01:26:46,831 --> 01:26:48,916
Let's get on with the wedding ceremony.

747
01:26:51,711 --> 01:26:56,257
First, a floral offering for the bride
from the unmarried girls of the island.

748
01:26:56,549 --> 01:26:58,884
A local custom for celebrating weddings.

749
01:26:59,176 --> 01:27:00,803
- Proceed.
- Music.

750
01:27:37,173 --> 01:27:39,425
Watch it. Your beard is showing.

751
01:27:40,134 --> 01:27:41,427
Here we go.

752
01:27:46,932 --> 01:27:49,518
These peasant shapes are not to my taste.

753
01:28:01,739 --> 01:28:03,032
Death to Gruda!

754
01:28:14,919 --> 01:28:16,170
Kill them!

755
01:28:47,243 --> 01:28:49,245
Port side battery. Fire!

756
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:00,047
No, I mean left. Left!

757
01:29:00,339 --> 01:29:02,466
No. Right. No, left a bit.

758
01:29:04,051 --> 01:29:05,511
What's the matter with you?

759
01:29:05,803 --> 01:29:07,763
Don't you know where you're going?

760
01:29:33,414 --> 01:29:34,415
Fire!

761
01:29:45,467 --> 01:29:47,094
We're going after the girl.

762
01:30:17,625 --> 01:30:18,918
Let's strip for action.

763
01:30:27,092 --> 01:30:28,093
Halt!

764
01:30:31,180 --> 01:30:33,933
We'll cut her to pieces. Man your cannons.

765
01:30:35,434 --> 01:30:36,560
Come on, now.

766
01:30:44,944 --> 01:30:46,904
The high explosive. Quick.

767
01:31:24,483 --> 01:31:26,819
- Get underway!
- Aye, aye, sir.

768
01:31:29,405 --> 01:31:30,906
Man the capstan!

769
01:31:35,911 --> 01:31:37,329
Get her below.

770
01:31:39,081 --> 01:31:41,208
Don't waste time. Slit the cable!

771
01:31:45,879 --> 01:31:48,841
We've got to gain altitude.
Unload the ballast.

772
01:31:56,932 --> 01:31:58,684
Come on. Get rid of something.

773
01:32:09,778 --> 01:32:12,322
- What is it?
- It is the wrath of heaven!

774
01:32:12,614 --> 01:32:14,366
It has destroyed the fortress!

775
01:32:16,785 --> 01:32:19,413
Our ship and our lads.
We're heading straight for them.

776
01:32:20,914 --> 01:32:22,332
Make it close.

777
01:32:24,626 --> 01:32:25,961
But not too close.

778
01:32:26,253 --> 01:32:29,298
We'll need our ship and our lads
to catch Gruda.

779
01:32:34,928 --> 01:32:37,347
They're going to blow us up!
Jump for your lives!

780
01:33:11,507 --> 01:33:13,634
- It's our own skipper!
- We knew you'd come.

781
01:33:13,926 --> 01:33:15,803
Get us off this ship.

782
01:33:16,095 --> 01:33:18,639
- Cut the rope down.
- Get us out of here!

783
01:33:35,364 --> 01:33:38,283
Pack out all canvas,
you fairy-tale sea snakes!

784
01:33:38,575 --> 01:33:39,785
Go get 'em!

785
01:33:45,207 --> 01:33:46,375
Move them!

786
01:33:46,708 --> 01:33:47,584
Move!

787
01:34:17,239 --> 01:34:20,284
I really think he plans
to do battle with us.

788
01:34:23,162 --> 01:34:25,873
Captain Vallo's lost his head
as well as his heart.

789
01:34:40,637 --> 01:34:41,847
Haul that jib.

790
01:34:44,975 --> 01:34:46,810
Trim those top gallows.

791
01:34:47,686 --> 01:34:49,146
Two points starboard.

792
01:35:01,742 --> 01:35:03,702
Hold your fire for a broadside.

793
01:35:03,994 --> 01:35:05,913
Shall we fire?

794
01:35:06,205 --> 01:35:09,666
There'll be no firing with the girl
on the ship. We're going to board her.

795
01:35:18,967 --> 01:35:20,969
Below decks, the lot of you.

796
01:35:21,261 --> 01:35:22,638
On the double.

797
01:35:30,604 --> 01:35:32,272
Coming, Mr. Bellows?

798
01:35:34,274 --> 01:35:36,860
The fools are going
to trade broadsides with us.

799
01:35:44,326 --> 01:35:45,577
In you go.

800
01:35:49,414 --> 01:35:52,125
With nobody at the wheel to steer,
we'll not get alongside.

801
01:35:52,417 --> 01:35:55,045
Too late to worry about it.
We'll have to take our chances.

802
01:35:55,337 --> 01:35:57,214
As ye wish. We'll go.

803
01:36:04,304 --> 01:36:06,014
My humble apologies.

804
01:36:06,306 --> 01:36:09,309
But if I can't live like a pirate,
I'll die like one.

805
01:36:09,601 --> 01:36:12,187
I'll stand by the wheel
and bring her alongside.

806
01:36:12,479 --> 01:36:14,773
Skipper! Do them the dirty!

807
01:37:05,824 --> 01:37:07,367
Stand by to fire!

808
01:37:17,586 --> 01:37:18,420
Fire!

809
01:41:11,152 --> 01:41:13,071
We're lost! Get the girl!

810
01:43:40,969 --> 01:43:43,221
Hold it, Professor! We've won!

811
01:43:43,555 --> 01:43:45,348
Get rid of that stuff.
