1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000

4
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,000


5
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,500


6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000

7
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,720
你在胡说八道
You're not saying things that mean anything.

8
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,930
这算是讨论问题? 我告诉你  这辆车就是更好
It's not even a debate. It's a better automobile!

9
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,400
别对我胡说什么林肯比凯迪拉克好
Ain't no way you can say to me a Lincoln is better than a Cadillac.

10
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,540
-林肯就是更好  -得了吧
-A Lincoln is better. It's a better automobile. -Forget about it.

11
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,440
卡迪拉克的提速快  马力也更足
A Cadillac's got more acceleration. It's got more power.

12
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,980
操控性也更好
It's got better handling.

13
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,520
空间也很大  它的马力也更足
It's got more legroom for your legs. It's got more power.

14
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,850
-这点你已经说过了  -不错
-You just said that. -Bingo.

15
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,440
-怎么了? -你已经说过马力更足了
-What? -You just said, "More power."

16
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,280
-你在开始重复你自己的话了  -我是那样说的吗?
-You're starting to repeat yourself. -I said that?

17
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:52,120
-你是老了  -那可要怪他
-You're getting senile. -He got me so fucking aggravated.

18
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,860
要我说  梅塞德斯比它们都要好
I'll tell you one thing, Mercedes got it all over both of them.

19
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,950
梅塞德斯奔驰?
A Mercedes?

20
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,030
开林肯的感觉就像在开一个该死的水床
A Lincoln's like driving a fucking water bed, for Christ's sakes.

21
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:02,430
-奔驰  -是啊  奔驰是好车
-A Mercedes. -Yeah. It's a good car.

22
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:12,380
让我告诉你  伙计  不要怀疑  林肯更长些
I'll tell you one thing, my friend. Undisputable. The Lincoln is longer.

23
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,740
它更长? 比谁更长? 比我下面更长?
It's longer? Longer like what? Longer like my dick is longer?

24
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,680
不不不  我们不是在说大众
No, no, no. We're not talking about a Volkswagen.

25
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,510
什么? 大众
What do you mean? Yeah, Volkswagen.

26
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,560
更长  一英寸长也是更长
Longer. Like longer. Like in inches it's longer.

27
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,220
-你在胡说八道什么  -这车更长
-You don't make no fucking sense. -It's a longer car.

28
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,510
两辆他妈的小车  好吧?
Two fucking cars, right?

29
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,890
这是一辆  这是一辆  对吧?
This is a car, this is a car, right?

30
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,020
在这里好不好?
Right here, okay?

31
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:32,260
如果所有条件都一样  那更长的会先达到目的
All things being equal, the one's longer gonna get there first.

32
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,860
这点不需要爱因斯坦般的智慧就能理解吧
You don't have to be fucking Einstein to understand this.

33
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:35,700
你知道当你达到以后会发生什么?
You know what happens when you get there, don't you?

34
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,000
-不  -那你还是去开那该死的林肯吧
-No. -You're still driving a fucking Lincoln.

35
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,580
我要给你看一张示意图
I'll show you a fucking picture.

36
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,540
是两辆车  更长的那辆先到达目的
Two cars. The one's longer gets there first.

37
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,940
这是客观事实  这辆更长
That's a scientific fact. It's a longer car.

38
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,950
-我能问一些事吗? -问什么?
-Can I ask you guys something? -What?

39
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:49,040
你们是那种聪明的家伙吗?
Are you guys, you know, wise guys?

40
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,750
聪明的家伙? 什么是聪明的家伙?
Wise guys? What are wise guys?

41
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,650
-你知道是什么  -为什么觉得我们是头目?
-You know... -What makes you think we're wise guys?

42
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,390
我们可能是警察
We could be cops.

43
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,190
确实
Yeah.

44
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,630
-你觉得我  便衣? -不  我没有
-You believed me. Undercover what? -No, I didn't.

45
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,200
-你相信过我  -不  只是...
-You believed me. -No, it's just...

46
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,600
-那人是谁? -哪个?
-Who's that over there? -Who?

47
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,370
吧台那边  留个小胡子的
The guy by the bar with the mustache.

48
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,970
那是唐  珠宝商  基利带来的
That's Don, Don the Jeweler. Jilly brought him here.

49
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,910
基利? 那个四眼?
What Jilly? Jilly "Four-eyes"?

50
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,950
不是四眼基利  他是从昆士来的
Not that fucking hump Jilly "Four-eyes." Jilly, you know, from Queens.

51
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:28,080
-你觉得他聪明吗? -不  他只是跑腿的
-You think he's a wise guy? -No, he's a connected guy.

52
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:32,990
跑腿? 那要是我脱手  他能帮我吗?
Connected? If I had a thing to lay off, he could lay it off for me?

53
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:36,100
-你怎么想不干了? -不是这个意思
-You got something you gotta lay off? -Ain't the question.

54
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,220
-你有东西要卖? -不管你的事
-You got something you gotta lay off? -Ain't the question.

55
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:41,390
我只是说  他是否能从我这收货  只是假设
I'm just saying if I had a thing, he could lay it off. That's all.

56
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,350
你欠这么多债
All that fucking money you owe downtown,

57
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,130
想退休你得先去劫辆运钞车
you'd have to lay off a fucking Brink's truck.

58
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,940
-桑尼有伴了  -我看有伴了的是"左撇子"老左吧
-Sonny's in love. -I think fucking Lefty's in love.

59
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,710

I'll see you.

60
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,450

Were you asleep?

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,820
-你还好吗? 宝贝  -我没事
-Are you okay, honey? -Yeah, I'm okay.

62

Okay. I'm sorry. I gotta go back to sleep. I'm so tired.

65
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,490
-好的  -好的
-All right. -All right.

66
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,500
-喂  -嗯?

67
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:53,760

把电话放在枕边
Put the phone on your pillow.

69
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,070
我要听你的呼吸声
I want to listen to you breathe.

70
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,740
你是珠宝商唐吗?
You Don the Jeweler?

71
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,330
这儿有些上等货色
There. That's some beautiful thing.

72
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,780
干嘛不给你老婆?
Why don't you give it to your wife?

73
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,320
我老婆? 我怎么能给我老婆?
My wife? How am I gonna give it to my wife?

74
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,550
-我没结婚  -女朋友呢?
-I ain't married. -Got a girlfriend?

75
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:49,020
-有个女友  -那就娶了她
-Yeah, I got a girlfriend. -So marry her.

76
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,370
你是认真的吗?
Hey, you for real?

77
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:56,360
我想请你看看中间那颗钻石
I'm asking you to middle a diamond for me here.

78
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,770
-看看它值不值八千块  -我建议...
-All I want from my end is $8,000. -And I'm saying to you

79
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,330
你最好把它送给不懂的人
is you should give it to somebody that don't know better,

80
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:05,170
这是A货
because that's a fugazy.

81
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,610
好吗?
All right?

82
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,810
它是A货? 你怎么知道?
That's a fugazy? How do you know it's a fugazy?

83
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,050
-你就看了一眼  -怎么? 是假货
-You looked at it for two seconds. -What? It's a fake.

84
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,190
我知道A货是什么意思
I know what a fugazy is.

85
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,860
老兄  想开开眼吗?
Hey, pal, you want to see something?

86

00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,600
你看  不错吧? 你看多漂亮
There you go. Ain't that something? That's a beautiful thing.

88
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:32,560
是漂亮  可惜不是我的
Yeah, that is a beautiful thing, but it's not my thing.

89
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:34,000
我这个呢?
What about this?

90
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:37,170
我说什么好呢? 想法脱手吧
What do you want me to say? Go ahead, try and sell it,

91
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,470
够爷们的话就把它打碎了
you want to be a dumbsky. Give it a shot.

92
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:42,610
够爷们? 你要我够爷们?
Dumbsky? You calling me a dumbsky?

93
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,640
知道你在跟谁说话吗?
You know who you're talking to, my friend?

94
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,910
老左  来啊  来喝一杯汽酒
Hey, Left. Come on, have a spritzer.

95
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:49,560
你不会是想拿着这东西去丢人吧
You want to go embarrass yourself with this thing...

96
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:53,590
丢人? 我的家人  我的孩子
Embarrass myself? My family, my children...

97
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:56,790
我的母亲  她们走在附近任何街上的时候
My mother can hold her head up in any neighborhood in this city

98
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,530
都能抬头挺胸? 明白吗?
when she walks down the block, see?

99
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:01,930
全部的五个区的人  都认识我  这可以不提了
In all the five boroughs, I'm known. Forget about it.

100
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,040
全世界的人都他妈认识我
I'm known all over the fucking world.

101
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:11,640
谁不认识我老左  去慕伯尼街问问
Anybody, ask anybody about Lefty from Mulberry Street.

102
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:16,680
-你惹了不该惹的人物了  -我并非想冒犯你
-You're pissing up the wrong fucking tree. -I didn't mean no disrespect.

103
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:20,020
-这是一个误会  -你去哪儿? 你坐下
-It's a misunderstanding. -Where you going? Sit down there.

104
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,030
你想甩开我吗?
You're gonna walk out on me?

105
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:29,490
只能我甩开你  你甩不开我
You don't walk out on me. I walk out on you.

106
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,230
-你有车吗? -有车

Take care.

109
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,720
把窗关上  我被吹的不爽
Put that window up. I'm gonna catch a draft.

110
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,050
我他妈要在这里得上癌症了
I'm getting fucking cancer over here.

111
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,360
-你会没事的  -我们要去哪儿?
-You'll be all right. -Where we going?

112
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:03,360
你是警察吗? 别他妈问来问去的
You a cop? Don't ask so many fucking questions.

113
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,030
好吧  我得教教你  伙计  我得教教你
Well, well, I've got to school you, my friend. I've got to school you.

114
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,330
搞什么? 你为基利工作  他从没教你?
What's the matter? You work for Jilly, he never school you?

115
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,770
教我什么?
School me in what?

116
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:18,470
我说话时别插嘴
You don't talk until I talk to you.

117
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,150
A货
Fugazy.

118
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:27,880
你说那个戒指是A货  你他妈就是一文盲
You call that ring a fugazy. You don't know word fucking one, my friend.

119
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:30,220
我知道什么是文盲  看着你我就知道了
I know. I look at you and I know.

120
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:33,490
你这家伙就不能闭上你的嘴
You a guy can't keep his fucking mouth shut.

121
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,130
我正说你呢
Hey, I'm talking to you now.

122
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,390
我做珠宝生意五年了
Look, I've been in jewels five years.

123
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,590
你说我要是连他妈锆石和钻石都分不出来
How do you figure I'm gonna earn the kind of money I do

124
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,500
我还赚屁个钱啊
if I can't tell a fucking zircon?

125
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,600
-这行有钱可赚? -什么?
-There's good money in it? -What?

126
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,170

-什么? 珠宝业? -谢谢
-What, jewels? -Thank you.

128
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:54,040
是啊  如果你懂行的话  有赚头
Yeah. If you know what you're doing, there is.

129
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:00,040
我们去23大街8号吧  看看你是不是有两把刷子
Let's go to 23rd and 8th. Then we'll find out if you know what you're doing.

130
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,090
你欠我八千块
You owe me $8,000.

131
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,330
不  等等  我给你钻石
No, hold on. Wait. I gave you the diamond.

132
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,620
老左  这人是谁?
Left, who's this guy?

133
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,330
-他说这是A的  -什么是A的?
-He says it's a fugazy. -What's a fugazy?

134
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:21,540
-钻石是A的  -A是什么?
-Your diamond's a fugazy. -What is a fugazy?

135
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,470
-得了  你知道的  -不要告诉我该知道什么
-Come on, you know. -Don't you tell me what I know.

136
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,910
-你心里有数伙计  -你们中有一个弄错了
-You know what you did, pal. -One of you has got to be wrong.

137
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,780
那是一颗蒂梵尼的钻石
That's a Tiffany fucking diamond.

138
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,650
老左  那是我老婆的钻戒
Left, that is my wife's fucking diamond ring.

139
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,910
可惜是A货的  老左
It's a fugazy, Left.

140
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,120
你拿走你老婆的戒指?
You took away your wife's ring?

141
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,750
听着  你带着戒指去第47大道去问问
Look, you bring that ring to any kike on 47th Street,

142
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,620
他会告诉你那是顶级的钻石
he's gonna tell you that that is primo.

143
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:45,890
你要拿你老婆的戒指去赌运气?
You took away your wife's ring to go bet on the Giants?

144
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,400
听着  你已经不想要它了  把它还给我  好吧?
Hey, look, you don't want it. Give it back to me, okay?

145
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,870
-老左  给我  -8000元
-Hey, Left, come on... -$8,000.

146
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,060
让我跟这混蛋单独谈谈
Let me talk to this fucking guy for a second.

147
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,570
就半秒  可以吧?
Just give me half a second, would you?

148
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,080
8000元
$8,000.

149
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,080
干嘛不去吧台喝一杯?
Why don't you go to the bar and have a drink?

150
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,710
我跟他谈几句  去吧
Let me talk to the guy for a minute. Come on.

151
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,320
我他妈可是黑带...你
Hey, I got a fucking black belt, pal. So you...

152
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,550
靠
Shit!

153
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:20,260
他会宰了你  懂吗?
This guy is going to fucking kill you. You understand what I'm saying?

154
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:22,490
我们只有两分钟的时间
We got about two minutes to figure a way out of this thing.

155
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,500
-对不起  -对不起? 你给我住嘴
-I'm sorry. -You're sorry? Shut the fuck up.

156
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:28,130
-说对不起有屁用  -我不想死
-Sorry ain't gonna do it. -I don't want to die.

157
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,640
是吗?
Yeah?

158
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,940
-你开的什么车? -保时捷
-What kind of car do you drive? -A Porsche.

159
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,480
把钥匙给我
Give me the keys.

160
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,980
拿去
All right.

161
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,650
-现在它是谁的? -是老左的
-Whose car is it now? -It's Lefty's.

162
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,720
它归老左了  对
Lefty's stuff. All right, good.

163
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,330
伙计  拿去喝一杯
That's for the fucking drinks, pal.

164
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:04,270
你干嘛给他钱  唐? 聪明人不会这样的
Why'd you pay for that drink, Don? A wise guy never pays for a drink.

165
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:07,710
-我不知道  -总是别人买单?
-I didn't know that. -Always on the arm.

166
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,940
好吧
All right.

167
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,020
你还是把他吓坏了
You scared that guy, though.

168
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,720
真是笑死我了
That cracks me up.

169
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:21,250
我一共做过26个人  可他们居然怕的是你
I got 26 fucking hits under my belt, and you're the one he's scared of.

170
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,690
-靠边  -什么?
-Pull over. -What?

171
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,160
靠边  我要拿些东西
Pull over. I've got to do something.

172
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,660
-这里吗? -是的  这里  靠边
-Right here? -Yeah. Right here, pull over.

173
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:27,260
好吧  我有点冷了
All right. I'm cool.

174
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:31,800
来  帮一下我  把这个拉出来  拉
Come on, give me a hand with this. Pull this out, pull it.

175
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,830
你把东西都拆散了
You're taking the whole fucking thing apart.

176
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:36,100
你没听到仪表盘下有声音?
You didn't hear nothing under the dash?

177
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:39,240
-我什么都没听到  -是这儿
-No, I didn't hear a fucking thing. -There it is.

178
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,670
我能装回去的
I can go right up the back.

179
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,310
你在搞什么鬼?
What the fuck are you doing down there?

180
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:47,820
-这里有点问题  -你认为有窃听器吗?
-Just feeling around here. -You think I got a wire in my car?

181
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,980
-干  -当我是傻瓜吗?
-Fuck! -You think I'm fucking stupid?

182
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:52,290
我说过吗? 我说了你有窃听器的吗?
Did I say that? Did I say you got a wire?

183
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,360
那你当着我面这样做
Say it to my face, if you're gonna do this.

184
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:57,090
算了  不过你得向我道歉
Nothing for nothing, but I think you owe me an apology.

185
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,290
这倒不是问题  问题是我掉了把螺丝刀在里
Ain't the question. I lost a screwdriver here.

186
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,070
-什么? -螺丝刀掉下去了
-You lost a what? -The screwdriver fell down there.

187
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:05,800
天啊  你掉把螺丝刀掉在我音响里面?
Come on. You lost a screwdriver in my fucking stereo?

188
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,840
你记得把它取出来  就在下面
You'll find it again. It's down there.

189
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:12,470
-你喜欢凯迪拉克Deville? -得了吧
-So you like the DeVille? -Forget about it.

190
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:15,410
我有个凯迪拉克Fleetwood Brougham
Yeah. I got the Fleetwood Brougham.

191
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,350
-是吗? 有丝织坐垫的吗? -得了吧
-Is that right? With the velour? -Forget about it.

192
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,950
-结婚了吗? -没
-Are you married? -No.

193
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,620
-我有个女友在加州  -真好
-I got a girl out there in California. -That's good.

194
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,560
她应该呆在那儿
She should stay in California.

195
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,420
就不会整天监视着你裤裆了
Keep your eye out for your balls.

196
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:35,330
-对  说得对  -我一向是对的
-Yeah, you're right. -I'm always right.

197
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:39,240
聪明人总是对的  什么时候都是
A wise guy's always right. Even when he's wrong, he's right.

198
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,220
道上的说法是
All the way up the line,

199
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,340
跑腿的先做头目  然后做心腹  最后做老大
connected guy to wise guy to skipper to boss.

200
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,010
-是的  我懂  -你懂?
-Yeah, I know that. -You know?

201
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,950
-是啊  -你懂什么?
-Yeah. -What do you know?

202
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:52,020
就像军队里的军衔关系
It's kind of like the army, like a chain of command.

203
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,110
军队? 一点都不像军队
The army? It ain't nothing like the army.

204
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,890
军队里是一帮你全都不了解的家伙
The army is some guy you don't know

205
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:02,450
要你干掉另一帮你不了解的家伙  这才是军队
sends you out to whack some other guy you don't know. Army.

206
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:10,390
-明天跟我去看看吗? -好  好的
-You want to check in with me tomorrow? -Yeah, all right.

207
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:17,710
不知你是怎样看出那戒指真假的
I don't know how the fuck you knew that ring was a fugazy.

208
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,080
-明天见  -好  再见
-I'll see you tomorrow. -Yeah, so long.

209
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:04,320
珠宝商唐是个好商人  但不会赚大钱
Don the Jeweler is a good earner. He ain't a leech.

210
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:08,390
他很本份  只是个珠宝商
He keeps to himself. He's a jewel guy.

211
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,430
-他从哪儿来的  基利? -佛罗里达
-Where's he from, Jilly? -Florida.

212
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:14,020
-佛罗里达  -是个珠宝商
-Florida. -He's a jewel guy.

213
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:18,260
-具体是哪里? 是海边吗? -不  不是海边
-But Florida where? The beach? -No, not the beach.

214
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:22,900
我...我也太不清楚
I don't know.

215
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:25,210
不知道是不是道格春训的地方
Wherever the fuck the Dodgers have spring training.

216
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,340
靠得住吗?
He's a stand-up guy?

217
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:29,380
我只是认识他  老左  又没和他上过床
I said I knew him, Left. I didn't say I fucked him.

218
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:35,210
你  过来
Hey, you. Come here!

219
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,480
过来
Come here.

220
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,890
你说什么  基利? 什么事?
What do you say, Jilly? How you doing?

221
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,460
我朋友老左问起你  别丢我的脸  知道?
My friend Lefty's asking about you. Don't embarrass me, capisce?

222
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:49,560
我不会的  你知道的  基利
I wouldn't do that to you. You know that, Jilly.

223
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:52,330
对  不然的话我们就把你给做了
Because if you do, one of us is gonna whack you out.

224
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,910
那可不怎么好啊
That's not good.

225
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:56,310
基利  坐回去吧
All right, Jilly. Go back to your bath.

226
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,600
-保重  孩子  -你也保重
-Take care, kid. -Good to see you.

227
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,780
好了  我介绍你时
When I introduce you, I'm gonna say,

228
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:12,820
我会说"你是我的一个朋友"意思就是说你是我小弟
"This is a friend of mine." That means you're a connected guy.

229
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,690
如我改称你为"我们的朋友"
If I said instead, "This is a friend of ours,"

230
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,750
意思是说你是有点来头的
that would mean you're a made guy.

231
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:18,960
懂了么?
Capisce?

232
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:21,530
我的朋友  我们的朋友
Yeah, "friend of mine." "Friend of ours."

233
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,020
那我怎称呼你呢? 我们的朋友? 还是...
What do I call you? "Friend of ours," or...

234
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:24,870
你别提起我
You keep your mouth shut about me.

235
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:27,100
懂了吗? 唐
Know what I'm saying? Hey, Don.

236
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,170
你带钱了吗?
You got a couple of fazools?

237
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:33,140
-我有点事情  急用  -了解
-I got some things I got to take care of. -Yeah.

238
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,840
需要多少  一百?
What do you want? $100?

239
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,770
这算什么?
What are you doing?

240
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,250
聪明人是不这样放钱的
A wise guy don't carry his money in a wallet.

241
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:43,410
他会把钱卷起来  像这样
A wise guy carries money in a roll. Like this. See?

242
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,320
正面朝外  就这样  走吧
Beaner on the outside. Like that. Come on.

243
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,790
你那胡须
That mustache.

244
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:54,130
去剃了吧  那是不允许的
You got to get rid of that mustache, 'cause that's against the rules.

245
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:57,360
去买条裤子  别跟牛仔似的
And get a pair of pants, will you? This ain't a fucking rodeo.

246
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:00,840
要穿得像我一样  这是我家
Dress like I dress. This is my family.

247
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,840
-比我自己家更像我家  -这样可以吗?
-More even than my own family. -Is that right?

248
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,440
-我没有家  -你没有家?
-I don't got a family. -You don't got a family?

249
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:12,080
我是孤儿  我在孤儿院长大的
No, I'm an orphan. I grew up in an orphanage.

250
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,150
别担心  没事  就把它当自己家
Ain't the question, even if you had a family.

251
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:19,250
你觉得它是你家  它就是你的家了
If this is your family, then this is your family.

252
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,380
-懂我意思吗? -懂
-You know what I'm saying? -Yeah.

253
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,660
我蛋蛋都快冻掉了
I'm freezing my balls off.

254
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,890
这么冷整天呆在外面干嘛?
What do we got to be standing outside all day in the cold for?

255
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,030
-我们当标志杆  -南极的标志杆

安妮特这种女人  我对不住她  我身上什么都拿不出
A woman like Annette, I can't do right by her. I ain't got $3 in my pocket.

342
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,940
我喝了三杯汽酒才平静下来
I got to have three spritzers afterward just to calm down after I see her.

343

老二长了瘤  听不懂吗?
It's cancer of the prick. You didn't know that?

-I'd like to put a dent in that guy's head. -No, you don't do that, Donnie.

351
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:50,350
-你别动他  -我知道  我是说我想
-You don't touch him. -I know. I'm saying I wish I could.

352
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,980
你想?
You wish?

353
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:55,050
那人可不是你这样的人惹得起的
A guy like you doesn't touch a made guy.

354
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,760
你知道我昨天怎么样吗?

I went in front of all the skippers. That cocksucker Sonny Red, all of them.

356

我想让人记得你  明白我意思吗?
I went on the record with you. You know what that means?

357
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:12,700
我想是吧
I think I do.

358
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:15,570
你明白? 你明白个屁
You do? You ain't got no fucking idea, my friend.

359
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:19,880
现在没人敢碰你  你是我的人
Nobody can touch you now. I'm your man.

360
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:23,850
耶稣基督也不能碰你  因为我罩着你
Jesus Christ couldn't touch you, because I represent you.

361
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:27,810

遵守规则  然后谁知道呢
follow the rules, and who knows,

363
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,650
哪天要是有机会  你就扶摇直上了

别忘了到时候先介绍自己

387
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:35,840
免得她们把你认成推销员

-because you don't tell me, remember? -Because it's for your own protection.

390
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,190
总是说的是为了我一样
As if any of this is for me.

-不是一无是处  -对  不是也不是个好丈夫
-'Cause it's not nothing. -It's not nothing, but it's not a husband.

00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:03,470
多数女性不会这么想的
A lot of women would disagree with you.

395
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:08,750
你在外面就是干这个?
Is that what you do with all your time?

396
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,010
-让你的女人们填调查问卷? -我不想把自己说得太好

402
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:27,970

-It would be easier if you tell me... -Just give me a break.

408
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:44,810
你究竟在做什么?
...what goes on with these guys, what you do.

409

你就突然上帝一样的出现然后发号施令?
You can drop out of the sky like God and bark orders?

436
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,700
我把事情都交给你
You know that I wouldn't do this to you

437
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,660
是因为我信任你
if I didn't think you could handle it.

438
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,900
我不是在担心我自己  乔

Can you believe this? The boss gets whacked. The fucking boss.

461
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:31,120
也只有他被人做的消息我能知道
You never hear from the boss until he gets whacked

462
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:34,320
-然后你的生活却被改变了  -我们要去哪?
-and then your life gets turned around. -Want to tell me where we're going?

463
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:36,990
-我被请去干活  -那是什么意思?
-I got sent for. -So what does that mean?

464
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,430
-我被请去干活  -那是什么意思呢?
-You got sent for. -What does that mean?

465
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:41,420
你以为是什么意思?
What do you think it means?

466
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:44,200
你不想去? 你要我回去? 那我就回去
You don't wanna go? You want me to turn around? I'll turn around.

467
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,770
你想干什么? 在桥上掉头吗?
What are you gonna do? Take a left off the fucking bridge?

-不是这里  过了桥那边  -不  我也要去
-Not here, I'm saying after the bridge. -No, I gotta go.

You get sent for, you go. Sonny sent for me.

470
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,610
我真是受够了
I'm sick of this.

471
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:58,740
-红桑请你去吗? -我说是红桑吗?
-You got sent for by Sonny Red? -Did I say Sonny Red?

472
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:01,880
不是红桑是黑桑
Not Sonny Red. Sonny Black.

473
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,990
唐尼  你想干什么? 关上...
Donnie, what are you doing? Put the fuck...

474
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:07,530
你想用那冷风冻死我吗?
Donnie, you wanna kill me with that draft?

475
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,960
黑桑不是你朋友么? 有什么不可以吗?
Left, Sonny Black is your friend. What's the big deal?

476
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:16,130
对  我们比较熟  但绝对算不上朋友
Right. We're friendly. Ain't the question, "friend."

477
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,870
黑桑在监狱的时候
The whole time Sonny Black's in the can, the whole time...

478
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:22,740
他已成家  可他还有一个情妇
He's got a family, he's got a mistress.

479
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,070
还有情妇的情妇
He's got a mistress for the mistress.

480
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:28,310
他们都是我照顾的  只有我
I watched out for them, all of them. Me, I was the only one.

481
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:30,080
别人谁都不给一个子儿
Nobody else gave a fuck.

482
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,340
每周给两百块  一周接一周的给
Two hundred fazools, week in, week out.

483
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:36,580
你很会为黑桑着想  那你有什么可担心的呢?
So you took care of Sonny Black. What are you worried about, then?

484
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:40,790
有时候我会想  是不是你在孤儿院时把脑袋摔坏了
Sometimes I think, in that orphanage, they dropped you on your fucking head.

485
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:42,690
你不解释我怎么知道?
How am I supposed to know if you don't explain it?

486
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,920
但我知道那里头的滋味
You think I don't know how a hit gets set up?

487
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,020
你以为我不知道吗?
You think I don't know that?

488
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:48,000
我都知道
You know, what I know.

489
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:51,400
知道我进去过多少次吗?
How many times have I been on the other end of that fucking phone?

490
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,990
-二十六次  -厉害
-Twenty-six times. -Great.

491
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:55,160
你这不就在说黑桑和你是你朋友
You just got done saying you and Sonny Black are friends.

492
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:57,400
唐尼  人家请我了
Donnie, I got sent for.

493
00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:01,950
我们这行  被人要了  就是替人卖命  替人吃枪子
In our thing, you get sent for, you go in alive, you come out dead

494
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:03,780
而且常常就是你最好的朋友开的枪
and it's your best friend that does it.

495
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:25,840
我现在不安全  若出什么事一定要把车留给安妮特
Anything should happen to me, make sure Annette gets the car.

-Spritzer, Left? -Later, maybe.

497
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,920
你瞧那手  根本就不像是手
Look at this hand. This ain't a hand.

498
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:57,430
长得就像我见过的那种湖怪一样
This is a fucking deformed Creature from the Black Lagoon's claw I got here.

499
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,160
老左
Hey, Left.

500
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,230
-你把那些都押了? -我不知道
-You throwing that down? -I don't know.

Gin.

502
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:31,640
好运突然爆发是不奇怪的
Love on the rocks ain't no surprise

503
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:37,340
-鲍利  那不是炸  -那也不奇怪
-Paulie, that ain't gin. -Ain't no fucking surprise, neither.

504
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,470
赢了
It's gin.

505
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,040
你说什么? 你有对7
What are you talking? You got two sevens.

506
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,510
我是三条7
I had three sevens.

507
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:44,110
-鲍利  -尼克  我有三张七
-Paulie. -Nicky, I had three sevens.

508
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,550
我知道我有三张7  别瞎搞
I know I had three sevens. Don't start this shit now.

509
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:49,140
你知道你有三张7? 你没有三张7
You know you had three sevens? You don't have three sevens.

510
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,480

Let's go for a ride. I got a new car.

515
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:13,240
开这车去兜风无比拉风啊
Can you believe the ride on this car?

516
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:16,510
我真不明白那些德国人怎么输掉了战争
I can't understand how they lost a war, them Germans.

517
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,880

The one from the calendar. Miss Pennzoil Air Filter of 1978.

519
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:27,150

-What's he doing looking in the mirror? -What're you doing over there, Left?

520
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:29,160
我觉得我是在干吗?
What's it look like I'm doing?

521
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:31,520
我看我的唇膏
I'm checking my lipstick.

522
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:34,960
没有你我们要怎么办? 老左?
What would I do without you, Left? What would I do?

523
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:38,530
你呢  唐尼? 你会怎么办?
What about you, Donnie? What would you do?

524
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,900
给自己另找个老大  是不是?
Have to find yourself a new goombah, wouldn't you?

525
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,740
我们老板出了点事

526

出来混都要还的

什么? 你提升了吗
What, you got upped?

544
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:11,530
是鲁斯提在狱中安排的
Rusty's gonna run the whole thing from the can.

那你请我来干什么?
That's why you sent for me?

547
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:23,100
是啊  你说呢? 以为我们要干掉你?
Yeah, why? What did you think, you was gonna get whacked?

548
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:26,040
左兄以为他要被干掉了

552
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,960
这个我要怎么养?
What am I gonna do with this?

553
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,430
他认为它们会很臭
He thinks they smell fear.

554
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:21,830
真麻烦
I'm sick of this.

555
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:25,500
你和黑桑是朋友
You and Sonny Black are friends.

556
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,630
我说过了别提黑桑
I got told to shut my mouth about Sonny Black.

557
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:32,370
为了他有多少次我勇敢的反对老板  那个混蛋
How many times I stood up to the boss himself, that cocksucker.

558
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,640
愿他安息
May he rest in peace.

559
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:45,260
你必须要...你必须要...
You're gonna have to... You're gonna have to...

560
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:46,960
我去...

561
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:49,420
我要40个汉堡

562
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:51,890
不要洋葱
Hold the onions.

563
00:42:55,270 --> 00:42:58,360
黑桑混上去了  我也不傻
Sonny Black, they make skipper. I ain't a mutt.

564
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:01,840
三十年辛辛苦苦  得到什么?
Thirty years busting my hump. For what?

565
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:03,500
一头狮子  就是你
A lion.

566
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:06,480
五个小时前  你还觉得可能会被干掉
Five hours ago, you thought you was gonna get whacked.

567
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:10,680
-唐尼  我说过我要被干掉了吗? -没说这么细
-Donnie, did I say I was gonna get whacked? -Not in so many words.

568
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:14,240
我不懂  我到底说的多细了?
I don't understand you. How many words does it take?

569
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:18,090
你是对的  是我误会了
You're right. I misunderstood.

570
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:22,460
辛苦了三十年  大小事都叫我出面
Thirty years I'm earning. Any work to be done, call Lefty.

571
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:26,620
我从没抱怨过  少说也干掉了26个家伙
I never complained. Twenty-six guys I clipped.

572
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,160
提升过我吗? 从没轮到我
Do I get upped? No, they pass me by.

573
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:36,070
黑桑高升了  而我却没有
Sonny Black gets upped. I don't get fucking upped.

574
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,780
做掉老板这件事桑尼可能也有份
Sonny was probably in on whacking the boss.

575
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,510
当然有份
Of course he was in on whacking the boss.

576
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:47,110
除掉老板  这也瞒着我
Whacking the boss. Another thing I get left out of.

577
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:51,990
这些人  你知道  很官僚
It's like one of those, whatchamacallit, you know, bureaucracy.

578
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:56,290
什么官僚? 不是官僚了  你在说什么? 官僚?
What bureaucracy? Ain't no bureaucracy. What you talking about, bureaucracy?

579
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,860
你怎么想出来的? 官僚论
Where the fuck do you get your ideas? Bureaucracy.

580
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,260
我意思是  我在说他们不懂欣赏你
All I'm saying, I'm saying they don't appreciate you, is what I'm saying.

581
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:04,500
欣赏? 那他们欣赏你?
Appreciate? They appreciate you?

582
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,140
-干嘛  老左  我是你这边的  -你站在我这边?
-Come on, Left, I'm on your side. -You're on my side?

583
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,970
我说你是我这边的  你就是我这边的
You're on my side because I say you're on my side.

584
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,200
听着  唐尼
Hey, look. Donnie!

585
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:13,840
不要自以为是  唐尼
Don't get on your fucking high horse, Donnie.

586
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:16,140
我不喜欢那样
I don't like that.

587
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,260
但是  告诉你
But tell you what.

588
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:31,790
看那个
Look at that.

589
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:35,460
我想再搞条伯伦特型的船
I wish I had that boat again, that Bertram.

590
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:39,730
我希望我拥有条船
I wish I had that boat.

591
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:43,940
我带上安妮特车开这车  开到码头
I'd get in my car with Annette, I'd drive down to the pier

592
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,140
想去哪儿就去哪儿
I'd get on that boat and I'd go.

593
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:47,230
我要离开
I'd go.

594
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:50,800
天涯海角  没人能找到我
East, west, north, south, nobody'd ever find me.

595
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,790
你看现在  真他妈丢人
Look at this thing. It's a fucking insult.

596
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:28,050
走吧  快  快
Let's go! Come on.

597
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:21,190
我把这个给他
I gave it to him!

598
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:25,430
-不  桑尼  算了  -天呐
-Come on, Sonny! -Jesus!

599
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:28,060
-不  桑尼  不  -他拿到钱了
-No, Sonny! Please. -He's got the money.

600
00:47:57,370 --> 00:48:00,400
-他是我的朋友  -光天化日下  我简直不能相信
-He was a friend of mine. -Broad daylight. I can't believe it.

601
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:02,060
谁能光天化日之下
What kind of people are gonna take another man's property

602
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:04,270
在街上拿走别人的东西
right off the street?

603
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:06,040
算了吧
Forget about it.

604
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,840
整个社会都堕落到地铁里了
The whole society's going down the tubes.

605
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:11,210
尼克松在任的时候我们从来没有这种问题
We never had this kind of a problem when Nixon was around.

606
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:14,840
尼克松? 尼克松? 尼克松得了吧  尼克松
Nixon? Nixon? Forget about Nixon. Nixon.

607
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:17,580
全世界都尊重我们
We had respect all over the world.

608
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:19,020
我们有权利
We stood for something.

609
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:21,120
在街区里我们说了算
We had law and order in the street.

610
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:23,460
我们有过一些不同的故事
We had a little different story.

611
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,030
真可惜他不是西西里人
Too bad he wasn't Sicilian.

612
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:26,300
他是西西里人
He was Sicilian.

613
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:29,930
你知道  昨晚我看见罗杰・格雷上新闻了
You know, last night I'm watching Roger Grimsby on the news

614
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,630
那些穆斯林小丑们又在街上游行
and those Ayatollah cockamamie people are marching through the streets,

615
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:34,600
他们相互鞭打背脊
and they're whipping each other on the back with whips.

616
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:36,110
胡说八道  我从没听说过
Get out of here. I never heard of that.

617
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:37,440
-唐尼  我还好吗? -什么?
-Donnie, am I right? -What?

618
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:39,430
他妈的狂想家
Fucking fanatics over there.

619
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:42,530
你为什么问他?
What're you asking him for? What're you asking him for?

620
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,940
这算什么  唱双簧? 我在问他问题
What was it, a ventriloquist act? I asked him a question...

621
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,630
但和我说干嘛  你问他去
But you're talking to me. You're asking him.

622
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:48,770
他读...你什么意思  为什么我问他?
He reads... What do you mean, why am I asking him?

623
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,680
去他妈的读报  你问我  你在问他什么?
Fuck if he reads. You ask me. What're you asking him?

624
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:53,550
-你看报了? -我在这里  再和你说话
-Did you see it? -I'm here. You're talking to me.

625
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:56,220
你在和我说话  那你和他说话干嘛?
You're talking to me. What are you talking to him for?

626
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:59,080
我先和你说  然后我和他说  我和每个人都说
I talk to you, then I talk to him. I talk to everybody.

627
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:00,420
好吧  好吧
All right, all right, all right.

628
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:26,280
桑尼  过来  波比
Sonny, come here. Bobby.

629
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:32,180
见到你真高兴
Good seeing you.

630
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:37,250
波比  给桑尼找个好座  开一瓶最好的酒  我买单
Bobby, give Sonny a good table and a bottle of your best, on me.

631
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:41,650
你该给他配个裁缝才是
Why don't you get him a tailor while you're at it?

632
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:19,790
-你好吗? 克特  -最近怎么样?
-What do you say, Curley? -How's it going?

633
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:22,620
这是华盛顿来的迪恩 布兰福
This is Dean Blanford, he's from Washington.

634
00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:24,220
-乔  -唐尼

635
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:26,630
叫我唐尼吧  我不想惹麻烦
Call me Donnie. I don't want to get confused.

636

假如你替里奇担保...
If you vouch for Richie Gazzo...

653

我不会替我不认识的人担保
I ain't vouching for nobody I don't know.

654
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,890

I was hoping we'd get off on the right foot here.

I grew up in an orphanage because my old man was killed in Okinawa.

762
00:59:56,610 --> 01:00:00,950
好了  听我说  唐尼  我都不知道我要对谁发誓
Yeah, well... Listen to me, Donnie, I don't know what to swear on.

763
01:00:01,050 --> 01:00:03,750
对我死去的父亲  我爱的妈妈还是我的孩子
My dead father, my mother who I love, my children.

764
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:08,920
我向你发誓  唐尼  有些事是你不知道的
I swear to you, Donnie, something is going on you don't know about.

765
01:00:09,030 --> 01:00:12,150
-我和他说了点话  -能说会道的家伙
-I was making conversation with the guy. -Mr. Smart Conversation,

766
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:15,130
告诉我你们说了些什么
you tell me what happens

767
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:18,070
如果黑桑决定去佛州
if Sonny Black decides he wants to go to Florida?

768
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:21,100
谁说他去了佛州?
Who said he's going to go to Florida?

769
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:25,300
唐尼  你别以为你能瞒得了我
Donnie, don't think you can pull the wool over my eyes.

770
01:00:25,410 --> 01:00:27,970
我知道你在讨好桑尼
I see you siding up to Sonny Black.

771
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:30,380
我亲眼看见你这样做了
With my eyes, I'm looking at you. You're doing it.

772
01:00:30,510 --> 01:00:33,920
-得了吧  -我没有讨好桑尼
-Come on. -I ain't siding up to Sonny Black.

773
01:00:34,050 --> 01:00:37,080
他要去了佛州  出什么事你得负责
He goes to Florida, you're responsible.

774
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:39,480
我也要负责  因为我要代表你
And I'm responsible because I represent you.

775
01:00:39,590 --> 01:00:41,390
老左  好了  我只是随便说说
Come on. I was just bullshitting around.

776
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:48,920
黑桑是条又长又肥的蛇...
Sonny Black is one big, fat, fucking snake in the...

777
01:00:49,470 --> 01:00:52,490
-草原  草原上的蛇  -现在还不能这样说
-Grass. Snake in the grass. -You can't say that now.

778
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:55,670
现在是他当家  别乱讲他
Sonny Black is a skipper. You don't open your mouth about him.

779
01:00:55,770 --> 01:00:59,670
老左  是里奇的电话  他说
Lefty, this fucking guy Richie calls me up. He says,

780
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:04,040
他正在和一群麻烦的家伙谈条件
"I'm getting hassled by a couple of half-assed wise guys."

781
01:01:04,150 --> 01:01:07,450
他被那些家伙烦得不行了  所以想找人跟他合伙
He's looking for a partner to give him a little peace of mind.

782
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:09,810
-他有一家夜总会  -夜总会?
-He's got this nightclub to run down there. -A nightclub?

783
01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:12,480
对  一家单身酒吧  靠海边
Got a singles bar. It's near the beach.

784
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:14,610
我到家里拿2个手榴弹
I got two grenades in my house.

785
01:01:14,830 --> 01:01:18,120
我宁可把整个姆巴里街炸飞我也不会离开你
I'd blow up all Mulberry Street before I'd give you up. You understand?

786
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:20,820
我不知道你要干傻事的话我会做些什么
I don't know what I would do if you did something wrong.

787
01:01:20,930 --> 01:01:24,090
我会和你共生共死  懂吗?
You understand? I'd die with you.

788
01:02:03,610 --> 01:02:04,970
快跑
Come on!

789
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:08,510
快跑  四号
Come on, Four!

790
01:02:09,450 --> 01:02:10,850
四号
Four!

791
01:02:19,660 --> 01:02:21,560
妈的  界内
-Shit. -That was in.

792
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:23,690
胡说
Bullshit. Knocked me so far...

793
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:27,120
别惹我
Don't push me!

794
01:02:28,670 --> 01:02:30,460
我会打爆你的头
I'll break your fucking head.

795
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:41,800
-糟了  他醒了  -你们这帮...
-Shit! He lives! -What the fuck are you...

796
01:02:44,350 --> 01:02:45,370
操
Fuck!

797
01:02:48,690 --> 01:02:50,050
天哪
Jesus Christ.

798
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:54,490
半小时了
Half hour.

799
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:57,920
-那人在哪儿? -我也不知道
-Where is this guy? -I don't know, Left.

800
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:07,940
-是不是他? -对  就是他
-Is that him? -Yeah, that's him.

801
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:17,340
唐  你带了贵客前来
Don, you brought the cavalry.

802
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:18,810
里奇 伽佐
Richie Gazzo.

803
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:22,010
-你好吗? -你好吗?
-How you doing? -How you doing?

804
01:03:22,890 --> 01:03:24,050
我迟到了
I'm late!

805
01:03:24,990 --> 01:03:28,520
我想你们能好好享受日光浴了
You guys got a chance to work on your suntans out here.

806
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:43,190
它叫王庭  这儿每个人都是国王
Kings Court. Where every man is a king.

807
01:03:43,970 --> 01:03:47,740
在有你自己的宴会厅前还得等待要学会安于现状
Wait until you get a load of the banquet room. You're gonna plotz.

808
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:53,150
问问这干嘛跟他妈垃圾场似的?
Ask him why this place is such a fucking dump.

809
01:03:54,750 --> 01:03:57,410
他想知道怎么会是这样  里奇
He wants to know why it's such a dump, Richie.

810
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:00,580
我被迫关门
I had to shut the doors.

811
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,950
混混们像吸血似的
The way these bums had their hands in my pockets.

812
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:05,760
这个两百  那个三百...
You know, $200 for this, $300 for that.

813
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:08,560
我老婆还要干那事  懂我意思吗?
I got a wife who does that, you know what I mean?

814
01:04:10,970 --> 01:04:12,700
叫他走  唐尼
Ask him to leave, Donnie.

815
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:17,770
-里奇  出去看看车好吗? -好的
-Richie, step outside, take a look at the car. -Sure. Great.

816
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:24,480
居然有这种家伙吗? 我看他连自己老婆都养不起
What kind of a man has a Malvole? He won't provide for his own wife.

817
01:04:24,810 --> 01:04:28,110
-听我说  这家伙没事  -你敢担保吗?
-I'm telling you, this guy's all right. -You vouch for him?

818
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:31,540
我是说  以前认识他  他还算...
When I knew him before, he was all right...

819
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:32,510
你替这家伙担保吗?
You vouch for the guy?

820
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:34,540
只是引荐一下
I'm just making an introduction.

821
01:04:34,540 --> 01:04:36,650
联营的事由你说了算
You got to make the decision about the joint.

822
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:42,460
说不定能行的
This would be something, you know,

823
01:04:43,070 --> 01:04:46,470
你我在这儿有自己的小天地
if we had my own lounge down here, me and you.

824
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:49,270
-想过吗? -桑尼会怎么想?
-You know? -What about Sonny?

825
01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:54,210
唐尼  不用你教
Donnie, don't tell me what to do, Donnie.

826
01:04:54,310 --> 01:04:56,140
我来问个问题
I'm asking a question.

827
01:04:56,710 --> 01:04:59,050
唐尼  黑桑只是在这里度假
Donnie, Sonny's down here for a vacation.

828
01:04:59,150 --> 01:05:01,120
他那也许还要享受一会儿
He ain't once gotten out of that chaise longue.

829
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:03,410
或许就像躺在他妈的吊床上
He lies there like he's in fucking traction.

830
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:07,420
是  我知道  可我也记得他曾说要开展业务什么的
Yeah, I know, but he did mention that he might wanna get something going.

831
01:05:08,830 --> 01:05:12,420
如果他要插手  那会怎么样?
Imagine Sonny Black operating down here. The way he is?

832
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:16,130
得了  黑桑属于布鲁克林区
Come on. Sonny Black belongs in Brooklyn.

833
01:05:16,270 --> 01:05:19,330
如果我们这里做得好
I guess if everything worked out

834
01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:22,570
我们要给他送点钱去吗?
we could send a few fazools up there, no?

835
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:30,510
拼搏了三十年  我得到了什么?
Thirty years I'm busting my hump. What do I got?

836
01:05:32,250 --> 01:05:34,980
就算是一条狗也有自己路边那一小块领土
Even a dog gets a warm piece of the sidewalk.

837
01:05:37,490 --> 01:05:39,610
这些年我不能白干
I ought to show something for what I did.

838
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:41,850
-你知道我意思吧? -当然
-You know what I mean? -Definitely.

839
01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:44,830
这儿不是纽约
This ain't New York down here.

840
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:49,450
没有政治  牢骚和争斗
New York with the politics, all the old beefs and the grudges.

841
01:05:50,770 --> 01:05:55,640
在这儿  我这种人能跟老板们坐在一起
Down here, a guy like me could sit down with the boss.

842
01:05:57,740 --> 01:05:59,470
明白我的意思吗?
You know what I'm saying?

843
01:05:59,610 --> 01:06:02,980
不再寄人篱下  自由自在
Get out from under, be a free agent again.

844
01:06:04,450 --> 01:06:07,880
唐尼  非常棒
I'm telling you, Donnie, nothing but right.

845
01:06:46,790 --> 01:06:50,520
老左想要得到桑托的认可
Lefty wants to ask Santo Trafficante for permission to operate down here.

846
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:53,490
-你得为我准备条船  -我们可没这么多钱
-You got to give me a boat. -We can't afford that kind of money.

847
01:06:53,630 --> 01:06:56,290
-什么样的船? -什么样我也不知道  70尺长的
-What kind of a boat? -I don't know. Like a 70-footer.

848
01:06:56,400 --> 01:07:00,100
-我只借用一天  -那一天可得花六千元  乔
-I want to take him out for the day. -You're talking $6,000 a day here, Joe.

849
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:02,500
桑托是的佛罗里达大老板
Santo Trafficante is the boss of Florida.

850
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:05,200
-他有权发号施令  知道吗? -我知道
-He sits on the Commission. Did you know? -I knew that.

851
01:07:05,340 --> 01:07:07,780
-一条70尺长的船  -都有80尺了
-A 70-foot boat? -It's up to 80, actually.

852
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:10,970
我们窃听到老左正跟桑托的人谈这个
We just picked up Lefty on a wiretap talking to one of Trafficante's guys.

853
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:14,640
如果要起诉放高利贷的话  还有一些东西要看
A few things to go over to make a loan-sharking indictment.

854
01:07:14,820 --> 01:07:16,340
可那非常重要
This is important!

855
01:07:16,990 --> 01:07:18,210
九十  是的
Ninety, actually.

856
01:07:18,350 --> 01:07:21,020
我已经照你说的提这个家伙担保了
I did what you asked. I came here and vouched for this guy.

857
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:24,290
然后呢  要我带桑托去玩橡皮鸭子吗?
So what, I'm gonna take Santo Trafficante out in a rubber ducky or what?

858
01:07:24,390 --> 01:07:26,330
伙计  看来我们要清洁下你的嘴了
We're gonna have to wash your mouth out, bud.

859
01:07:26,430 --> 01:07:29,420
沙利上头是尼克  还是尼克 西格?
Does Sally Paintglass report to Nicky or Nicky Cigars?

860
01:07:29,570 --> 01:07:31,730
-尼克 格拉斯  -尼克 格拉斯?
-Nicky Glasses. -Nicky Glasses?

861
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:36,930
我是说我们想用RICO对付桑尼
As I was saying, we've got to fold Sonny into the RICO...

862
01:07:37,070 --> 01:07:38,820
我他妈要的是船
I need a boat for this fucking sit-down!

863
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:41,270
我是摩门教徒  说话干净点
I'm a Mormon, mister. Now clean it up.

864
01:07:41,410 --> 01:07:42,970
乔  你的录音机有毛病了
Joe, I think you got a malfunction on your tape recorder.

865
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:45,510
给我一艘船  好吗? 什么?
Get me a fucking boat, would you? What?

866
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:47,580
我什么都听不见
I'm not getting anything here.

867
01:08:13,310 --> 01:08:15,640
我很担心  他陷的太深了
I'm worried. He's getting strung-out.

868
01:08:16,810 --> 01:08:21,010
我们会搞到证据的  干他妈的
We're getting what we want. Fuck him.

869
01:08:23,150 --> 01:08:24,310
全都在这儿
There it is.

870
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:30,990
只需慢慢拿走它
Just moving behind, nice and slow.

871
01:08:32,630 --> 01:08:34,600
干嘛不数数呢? 伙计  数呀
Why don't you count it, my friend? Go ahead.

872
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,860
都在这里了  不会有错的
It's all there. No bullshit.

873
01:08:39,190 --> 01:08:40,630
我们是好人吧?
We're bueno?

874
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:45,000
很高兴跟你们做生意
Pleasure doing business with you caballeros.

875
01:08:47,010 --> 01:08:49,480
哥伦比亚  海上的明珠
Oh, Columbia, the gem of the ocean

876
01:08:50,050 --> 01:08:52,310
勇敢和自由的家园
The home of the brave and the free

877
01:09:00,090 --> 01:09:01,990
-干  -干
-Fuck. -Fuck!

878
01:09:04,830 --> 01:09:08,560
你在干什么? 你想把我扔进池子里去?
What are you doing? You want to throw me in the pool? You got the balls?

879
01:09:08,870 --> 01:09:10,800
他还没想好呢
He hasn't made a pick yet.

880
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:12,890
忘了这些狗
Forget those dogs.

881
01:09:13,370 --> 01:09:16,430
如果你现在量我血压
Hey, you know, if you took my blood pressure right now,

882
01:09:17,130 --> 01:09:19,530
肯定完全正常了
it'd be down 100%.

883
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:23,440
还好鲁斯提在坐牢
Rusty's locked up in the can with his fucking sinuses.

884
01:09:23,550 --> 01:09:25,740
要是他发现你们在佛罗里达
He finds out you're down in Florida...

885
01:09:28,650 --> 01:09:30,850
我才不鸟他
I don't punch a clock for Rusty.

886
01:09:31,450 --> 01:09:33,450
在这里要像爷们一样
Live your life like a man down here.

887
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:35,250
算了吧  桑尼  到了明天
Forget about it, Sonny. By tomorrow,

888
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:37,850
你就会为吃不到纽约的面包而哭了
you're gonna be crying you miss the New York bread.

889
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:40,050
纽约的面包象蛋糕
New York bread is like cake.

890
01:09:41,330 --> 01:09:44,130
两周了你还穿着同样的衬衣
Hey, two weeks you're wearing the same fucking shirt.

891
01:09:44,230 --> 01:09:45,760
什么意思?
What does that mean?

892
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:50,200
什么意思?
What does that mean?

893
01:09:52,540 --> 01:09:55,310
我又不着急赶回纽约去
I'm not in a big hurry to go back to New York.

894
01:09:55,410 --> 01:09:58,180
是啊  别担心这个  再过一天
Yeah, don't worry about it. One more day,

895
01:09:58,510 --> 01:10:01,350
那衬衣就会自己跑回纽约去了
that fucking shirt's gonna go back to New York on its own.

896
01:10:01,450 --> 01:10:03,080
那是我不要联合服务的原因了
That's why we don't get service in this joint.

897
01:10:03,190 --> 01:10:05,020
他们肯定会说
They see you in that fucking shirt, they say,

898
01:10:05,020 --> 01:10:06,620
太脏了  拒绝服务
"There's Joe Faccia Di Culo," in that shirt.

899
01:10:09,990 --> 01:10:11,220
够了
That's enough.

900
01:10:11,860 --> 01:10:15,060
够了? 够了是什么意思?
"That's enough?" What does that mean, "that's enough"?

901
01:10:17,030 --> 01:10:19,520
看看  他生气了
Look at him, look at him. He's mad.

902
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:23,440
-唐尼  我们去走走  -去哪儿?
-Hey, Donnie, let's go for a walk. -Where?

903
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:26,600
-走  我们去酒吧  -好
-Come on, I'm gonna get a candy bar. -All right.

904
01:10:26,810 --> 01:10:29,840
看他  那件衬衣本来是黄色的
Look at him, that was once yellow, that shirt.

905
01:10:33,250 --> 01:10:36,310
我们现在得怎么称呼他? 佛罗里达的桑尼
What are we supposed to call him now? Sonny Florida.

906
01:10:36,510 --> 01:10:39,270
小心  别真把他惹火了
Watch out, you're gonna put him on the warpath again.

907
01:10:40,180 --> 01:10:41,150
是的
Yeah.

908
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:45,070
那件衬衣  简直就是理发师给你绑的破布
That shirt. That's the shirt the barber gives you to put over your shirt.

909
01:10:52,370 --> 01:10:54,770
我想知你干什么去了
I want to know what you're up to.

910
01:10:55,070 --> 01:10:57,600
-什么意思? -昨天
-What do you mean? -Yesterday.

911
01:10:59,950 --> 01:11:01,310
昨晚?
Last night?

912
01:11:01,780 --> 01:11:03,770
昨晚你在干什么?
What were you doing last night?

913
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:07,440
我说昨天什么时候? 昨晚什么时候?
No, I'm saying, when yesterday? What time yesterday?

914
01:11:07,550 --> 01:11:11,960
到这里来  想糊弄我
Come here. Don't mess around with me. Yesterday fucking afternoon.

915
01:11:13,330 --> 01:11:14,550
什么也没做
Nothing.

916
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:17,530
为什么左撇子这么希望我回纽约?
Why has Lefty got such a hard-on to send me back to New York?

917
01:11:17,630 --> 01:11:20,460
得了  桑尼  那家伙在耍你玩呢
Oh, come on, Sonny. That guy's busting your balls down there.

918
01:11:20,570 --> 01:11:22,060
我想知道
I wanna know.

919
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:27,600
我想知道你们到底在这里搞什么
I wanna know what you got going on down here.

920
01:11:27,710 --> 01:11:28,760
我不懂  桑尼
I don't understand, Sonny.

921
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:30,660
我们赚点说不出口的零钱你都要一一过问吗?
You wanna know about every half-assed scam that'll amount to nothing?

922
01:11:31,210 --> 01:11:32,640
没错
That's right.

923
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:36,870
听着
Look.

924
01:11:38,380 --> 01:11:40,220
我没有任何冒犯的意思
I don't mean any disrespect.

925
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:42,220
我的意思是  我知道你是大哥  而我微不足道
I mean, I know you're a skipper and I'm a nobody,

926
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:45,550
但是我不能把老左卖了
but I can't do that to Lefty.

927
01:11:45,660 --> 01:11:48,820
听着  鸟人  小心我做了你
Listen to me, you cocksucker, I'll eat your fucking balls for breakfast.

928
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:51,800
你明白吗? 你们每一个人
You understand me? Every fucking one of you.

929
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:56,060
这是性命攸关的事  不是什么该死的游戏
This is life or death. Not a fucking game, Donnie.

930
01:11:56,400 --> 01:12:00,030
这是我说的这样  现在  你告诉我
This is my say-so. Now, you tell me.

931
01:12:02,810 --> 01:12:04,440
我做不到  桑尼
I can't do it, Sonny.

932
01:12:04,540 --> 01:12:07,810
要是我现在就做了你
How about if I fucking whack you right here and now?

933
01:12:10,250 --> 01:12:12,440
你想怎么样就怎么样吧
Do what you have to do, Sonny.

934
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:14,690
我不能出卖老左
I can't do that to Lefty.

935
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:49,210
-妈妈  帮帮我好吗? -你好?
-Mommy, I need some help. -Hello?

936
01:12:49,390 --> 01:12:50,380
--嗨
-Hey. -Hey.

937
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:52,510
-太紧了  -我来了  宝贝
-It's too tight. -Here, sweetie.

938
01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:55,190
-我在佛罗里达  -你在佛罗里达干嘛?
-I'm in Florida. -What are you doing in Florida?

939
01:12:55,290 --> 01:12:57,590
我也不知道  算是钓海龟吧
I don't know. I'm hunting for turtles.

940
01:12:57,730 --> 01:13:00,390
你以为我在干什么? 我是在工作
What do you think I'm doing in Florida? Honey, I'm working.

941
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:03,800
今天只有12度  把外套给我穿上
It's 12 degrees here. Excuse me, you're wearing this coat!

942
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:06,680
年轻的小姐  你得把外套穿上
Young lady, you are wearing this coat.

943
01:13:07,310 --> 01:13:09,040
-婊子  -你说什么?
-Bitch. -What did you call me?

944
01:13:09,140 --> 01:13:10,800
-家里还好吧? -你刚才说什么?
-Is everything all right? -What did you...

945
01:13:10,940 --> 01:13:12,970
我要是说不好又怎样? 会有什么不同吗?
What if I said no, Joe? Would it make any difference?

946
01:13:13,110 --> 01:13:15,740
-恐怕不会? -那就别问了  过来  起来
-I guess not. -So don't ask me. Come on, stand up.

947
01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:19,910
约翰・伟恩死了  举国哀掉
"John Wayne dead. Nation mourns."

948
01:13:24,490 --> 01:13:26,460
他怎么会死呢?
How can John Wayne die?

949
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:30,220
跟印第安人有关吧
The fucking Indians got him.

950
01:13:31,530 --> 01:13:35,630
他是个保守专制的男人
"Old-fashioned family man. Ruled with an iron hand."

951
01:13:36,140 --> 01:13:37,300
你看
Look at that.

952
01:13:46,180 --> 01:13:48,670
让我跟凯莉谈谈圣餐礼的事吧
Let me talk to Kerry. I want to talk about the Communion.

953
01:13:49,010 --> 01:13:51,140
拜托  她都不想参加了
My God, Joe. She doesn't want to do it.

954
01:13:51,250 --> 01:13:53,480
你说什么? 她不能说不去就不去
What do you mean? She ain't got no choice.

955
01:13:53,590 --> 01:13:56,180
-快把外套穿好  -把电话给她  玛吉
-You are wearing this coat! -Put her on the phone, Maggie.

956
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:59,880
我不知道几时再能给你电话  她不知道怎么吃圣餐?
I don't know when I can call again. Does she know not to bite the wafer?

957
01:14:00,030 --> 01:14:01,990
我不知道  但是她已经决定了
I don't know. She's acting out or something.

958
01:14:02,090 --> 01:14:03,990
-我下周回来一趟  -多谢
-I'll be back next week. -Thank you.

959
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:06,620
我答应你一定回来带她去圣餐礼
Maggie, I promise I'll get back for her Communion.

960
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:09,990
-你那件看来也不行  -别和你妹妹闹
-Yours doesn't look any better. -Don't start it with your sister.

961
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:12,040
-乔  我要出去了  -什么?
-Joe, I got to go. -What?

962
01:14:12,570 --> 01:14:14,040
我爱你  真是的
I love you. Shit.

963
01:14:15,210 --> 01:14:18,510
-给谁打电话? 里奇吗? -不是  桑尼说什么啦?
-Who's that on the phone? Richie? -No. What did Sonny say?

964
01:14:20,710 --> 01:14:24,080
-跟桑尼说酒吧的事啦? -没有  我还以为你说了
-You told Sonny about the club? -No, I thought you did.

965
01:14:24,250 --> 01:14:27,880
-别提起就是了  打电话给里奇吧  -好的
-Just shut up about it. Call Richie. -All right.

966
01:14:42,670 --> 01:14:46,100
像桑托那些人物
Big guy like Santo Trafficante, he's been around

967
01:14:46,510 --> 01:14:48,600
自从小胡子比兹之后就是老板
since the Mustache Petes.

968
01:14:48,810 --> 01:14:50,740
你要尊敬他
You gotta respect the man.

969
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:53,400
-唐尼  你弄到船了吗? -没  我正在想办法
-Donnie, you get that boat yet? -No, I'm working on it.

970
01:14:53,610 --> 01:14:56,210
别说不行  你要想办法搞定
Don't tell me no. You got to get that boat.

971
01:14:57,820 --> 01:15:01,620
我已找过他们了  他手下人说他很喜欢船
I reached out already. His man says, "Lefty, he loves boats."

972
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:04,150
我跟他说是一百尺的大船
I told him a 100-foot boat. I'm on the clothesline now.

973
01:15:04,290 --> 01:15:05,980
我知道  我正在想办法
I told you, I'm working on it.

974
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:11,160
-你可别让我失望  -我让你失望过吗?
-Don't disappoint me again, please. -Again? Since when did I disappoint you?

975
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:13,200
得了吧  这是什么?
Forget about it. What's this?

976
01:15:13,730 --> 01:15:16,200
你看  我们可以互相寄送
Look at that. Same thing we call each other.

977
01:15:16,370 --> 01:15:19,030
对  我的朋友  我们的朋友  对
Friend of mine, friend of ours. Good.

978
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:21,660
它是双关语  你知道吗?
But there's the double meaning. You get it?

979
01:15:22,340 --> 01:15:23,540
-懂我的意思吗? -是的
-Know what I mean? -Yeah.

980
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:26,220
-做老板的会喜欢的  -是的
-A boss appreciates a thing like that. -Yeah.

981
01:15:27,010 --> 01:15:29,710
-很有讽刺意味  -是的
-The irony of it. -Yeah, irony.

982
01:15:30,150 --> 01:15:33,050
别提了  再放个小礼物进去
Forget about it. Put a beaner inside here,

983
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:34,710
这样他就知道我们都是好样的
then he knows these are men of men.

984
01:15:35,250 --> 01:15:37,850
如果我在想办法的时候
You see, if I work out the strategy right,

985
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:40,220
你也要提出你的意见
you got to hold up your end now.

986
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:42,050
-懂我的意思吗? -是的
-You know what I'm saying? -Yeah, I know.

987
01:15:42,190 --> 01:15:44,860
懂我的意思吗?
You got to hold up your end now. You know what I'm saying?

988
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:47,930
这个多少钱? 唐尼  你要吗?
How much is this? Donnie, you got something on you?

989
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:51,000
-你在干什么? -5元怎么样?
-What are you doing there? -How about here's $5?

990
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:56,330
-你干的很棒  -什么?
-You're doing an amazing job, you know. -What?

991
01:15:56,940 --> 01:16:00,380
-我们都是这样想的  -是的  绝对是
-I mean, we all think so. -Yeah. Absolutely.

992
01:16:02,750 --> 01:16:04,840
真想大叫几声
For crying out loud. Fuck.

993
01:16:07,820 --> 01:16:09,720
-能问你一个问题吗? -什么问题?
-Can I ask you something? -What?

994
01:16:09,820 --> 01:16:13,220
什么是"得了吧"? 什么意思?
What's "forget about it"? What is that?

995
01:16:14,430 --> 01:16:16,620
"得了吧"  就是说...
"Forget about it" is like

996
01:16:18,260 --> 01:16:20,130
如果你认同别人说...
if you agree with someone.

997
01:16:21,030 --> 01:16:24,760
象拉古是个大傻瓜  你就说得了吧
Like, "Raquel Welch is one great piece of ass." "Forget about it."

998
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:28,600
有时别人说林肯比卡迪拉克好
But then, if you disagree, like, "A Lincoln is better than a Cadillac?

999
01:16:28,710 --> 01:16:30,140
你不同意时你就说得了吧
"Forget about it."

1000
01:16:31,180 --> 01:16:34,080
又比如对世界上最棒的东西
It's also like if something is the greatest thing in the world.

1001
01:16:34,180 --> 01:16:37,150
这胡椒  得了吧  懂了吗?
Like "Minghia, those peppers! Forget about it!" You know?

1002
01:16:38,650 --> 01:16:41,020
有时它跟说见鬼去吧差不多
It's also like saying, "Go to hell," too.

1003
01:16:41,890 --> 01:16:45,030
比如说  鲍利  你那东西只有一寸长
Like, "Paulie, you got a one-inch pecker."

1004
01:16:45,030 --> 01:16:46,760
鲍利就可以说  得了吧
And Paulie says, "Forget about it."

1005
01:16:47,130 --> 01:16:50,120
得了吧  鲍利  得了吧
Forget about it. "Paulie, forget about it."

1006
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:56,630
有时它就是指忘了这事吧
Sometimes it just means, forget about it.

1007
01:16:58,070 --> 01:17:00,830
好了  太感谢了  我懂了
All right. Thank you very much. I got it.

1008
01:17:01,210 --> 01:17:04,640
告诉你们  要是我还没给老左弄到船
Let me tell you something. I don't get this boat for Lefty...

1009
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:08,300
-什么? 又得了吧  -真他妈得了吧?
-Forget about it? -Fucking forget about it.

1010
01:17:08,450 --> 01:17:12,350
你知道那个行动吗? 叫什么来着?
You know that sting operation? What do you call it?

1011
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:16,710
就是穿的像阿拉伯人去行贿议员?
Where the agents dress up like Arabs and try to bribe congressmen?

1012
01:17:19,390 --> 01:17:21,150
-他们有条船在这儿  -什么?
-They got a boat down here. -What?

1013
01:17:21,260 --> 01:17:24,200
-"阿拉伯人贿赂号"  -太好了  就是阿巴斯康号
-Abscam. -That's right. It's Abscam.

1014
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:26,660
是吗? 我们能弄到它?

Maintenance. I'm not gonna call a maintenance guy. What are you, crazy?

1033

Janitor, come on. I don't want him touching it.

I got news for you, Donnie. You won't see me tomorrow.

1069
01:19:52,340 --> 01:19:54,840
明天是母亲节
Tomorrow is Mother's Day,

1070
01:19:54,950 --> 01:19:57,920
而聪明的家伙母亲节是不工作的
and wise guys don't work on Mother's Day!

1071
01:19:58,020 --> 01:19:59,640
你个鸟人

等一等  我马上就来
Wait a minute. I'll be there.

1080

桑托先生  这是老左  我们的朋友
Mr. Trafficante, this is Lefty, a friend of ours.

1081
01:20:51,540 --> 01:20:53,230
我不知道该怎么说

这是我专为你准备的  桑托先生
That's the boat I arranged for you, Mr. Trafficante.

It's got everything. Got a full bar, any kind of music you want.

1086
01:21:06,380 --> 01:21:09,180
想打个电话吗? 上面有
You want to make a telephone, it's got telephones.

1087
01:21:09,350 --> 01:21:12,190
-还有什么问题吗  -桑尼在哪儿?
-Any questions, you ask me. -Where's Sonny Black?

姬丽安在哪里?
Where's Gilligan?

1094
01:21:34,110 --> 01:21:35,770
这才是我想要的那种船
Now, that's what I call a boat.

1095
01:21:35,910 --> 01:21:37,910
是的  呃...是

Here.

1097
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:23,860
你要在这里经营  你得知道点规矩
Sure, you can operate here. You got to show a little respect.

1098
01:22:48,590 --> 01:22:50,110
这边
Hey! Over here.

1099
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:06,090
我实在不想看到你
I don't even want to look at you.

1100
01:23:06,340 --> 01:23:10,040
-你知道什么是两面派? -我又怎么了?
-You know what the bow is? -What did I do now?

1101
01:23:10,180 --> 01:23:12,470
你是个阴险的小人
You stabbed the wrong guy in the back, my friend.

1102
01:23:12,610 --> 01:23:15,810
什么? 你以为我告诉黑桑的?
What are you talking about? You think I said something to Sonny?

1103
01:23:15,950 --> 01:23:17,780
到船头去吧  我就呆在这儿
Go to the bow. I'm gonna stay in the stern.

1104
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:19,980
过去吧  去啊
Go to the bow. Stay there.

1105
01:23:21,550 --> 01:23:23,750
我很讨厌你  懂吗?
I'm so disgusted with you, you know that?

1106
01:23:23,860 --> 01:23:26,790
-是的  刚说过这话  -就是如此

-在这儿做什么? -桑托先生和你想的不同

-是个不错的老头  是吗? -得了吧
-Is that right? Is he a good old guy? -Forget about it.

1109
01:23:47,350 --> 01:23:50,640
那老家伙已经经营了50多年
That motherfucker had this all to himself for 50 fucking years

1110
01:23:50,750 --> 01:23:52,840
可这里还是像个农村
and it's still a cow town.

1111
01:23:53,390 --> 01:23:55,950
这里本该发达的像拉斯维加斯了
This could be like Vegas down here.

1112
01:23:56,860 --> 01:23:59,790
去他妈的红桑和泽西
Forget about Sonny Red and his trucks in Jersey.

1113
01:23:59,890 --> 01:24:02,090
佛罗里达才是我想要的
This is all I want. Florida.

1114
01:24:02,290 --> 01:24:06,590
我告诉你  红桑现在肯定蛋都冻硬了
Tell you something. Sonny Red is freezing his nuts off right now.

1115
01:24:09,270 --> 01:24:11,100
那是
That's for sure.

1116
01:24:12,570 --> 01:24:15,230
我只要路斯提给我一点经费
All I need is the start-up money from Rusty

1117
01:24:15,370 --> 01:24:16,400
等我们有钱了  你想怎样呢?
and then we all get rich.

1118
01:24:16,540 --> 01:24:18,600
等我们有钱了  我们要回纽约吗?
Are we heading back to New York pretty soon?

1119
01:24:18,740 --> 01:24:22,270
你就不用了  我要你在这里管事
Not you. I want you to represent me down here, Donnie.

1120
01:24:22,910 --> 01:24:25,440
我要让你在这儿为我做事
I want you to be my man in Florida.

1121
01:24:25,820 --> 01:24:28,750
去掌管那酒吧  就是那个"王庭"
Get that club going. You know, Kings Court.

1122
01:24:38,130 --> 01:24:40,720
你在想我怎会知道的  是吗?
You didn't think I knew about that, did you?

1123
01:24:42,130 --> 01:24:44,830
我想我会把狮子交给你
I think I'll send the lion down here with you.

1124
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:47,440
把它养在停车场里
Keep that big pussy in the parking lot.

1125
01:24:49,470 --> 01:24:52,600
你知道的桑尼  我真的很感激你的好意...
You know, Sonny, I really appreciate the offer and everything,

1126
01:24:52,710 --> 01:24:55,310
但我在纽约还有些事要处理
but I got a lot of things going on in New York.

1127
01:24:55,450 --> 01:24:59,510
-我还要回去  -你也知道老左  很厚道一个人
-I'd like to keep them... -Lefty's a dynamite guy. No doubt about it.

1128
01:24:59,650 --> 01:25:02,120
我在狱中时他照顾过我
He looked after me when I was in the can.

1129
01:25:02,390 --> 01:25:04,410
那些事我不会忘的
That's something I don't forget,

1130
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:07,010
有些甚至终身难忘
something that I will never ever forget.

1131
01:25:07,230 --> 01:25:11,030
他很讲义气  他真的很关心你
He's a stand-up guy. He really cares about you, too.

1132
01:25:11,460 --> 01:25:13,360
我知道的
Yeah, I know he does.

1133
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:18,000
但...问题是你认为他在帮你
The problem is that you think that he's helping you,

1134
01:25:18,140 --> 01:25:19,970
实际他也在拖你后腿
but he's hurting you.

1135
01:25:21,140 --> 01:25:23,610
他有时候搞不清状况
He gets those two or three wines in him...

1136
01:25:23,980 --> 01:25:26,140
知道我的意思吗?
You know what I'm saying.

1137
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:32,510
我不想踩着别人往上爬  不会的
I don't want to be stepping on nobody's toes.

1138
01:25:32,620 --> 01:25:35,310
-如果不是因为老左  我...  -那是的
-If it wasn't for Left, I... -That's it. Look.

1139
01:25:38,260 --> 01:25:40,090
你现在是我的人了
You belong to me now.

1140
01:25:42,590 --> 01:25:43,750
就这样了
That's it.

1141
01:25:53,910 --> 01:25:56,030
桑托要走了
Mr. Trafficante's leaving.

1142
01:25:59,410 --> 01:26:02,040
-你说呢? -天哪  他们笑死人了
-You believe that? -Ulcers, Christ, they're killing me.

1143
01:26:02,150 --> 01:26:03,510
过来
Come here.

1144
01:26:04,620 --> 01:26:06,110
桑托  这是唐尼
Santo, this is Donnie.

1145
01:26:06,250 --> 01:26:09,350
-我们的朋友  -见到你很高兴
-He's a friend of ours. -Hi, Donnie. Nice to meet you.

1146
01:26:11,290 --> 01:26:13,620
-这是唐尼  -你好吗
-This is Donnie. -Hi, how you doing?

1147
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:26,630
-替我向乔问好  -我会的
-Give my best to Joe, will you? -I will.

1148
01:26:26,770 --> 01:26:29,500
他被雪困住了  你能想象吗?
Snowed in. Can you believe him?

1149
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:33,830
过分  女儿的第一次圣餐礼他都不回家
Right. His daughter's First Communion, and he gets stuck at an airport.

1150
01:26:34,550 --> 01:26:37,670
雪太大  不安全  再见  好吗?
That's for his own protection. I'll see you later. Okay?

1151
01:26:37,820 --> 01:26:40,680
-我讨厌坐飞机  -路上小心
-I hate flying. -I know you do. Be safe.

1152
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:45,110
心肝
Oh, sweetheart.

1153
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:51,490
宝贝
Honey.

1154
01:26:53,300 --> 01:26:57,290
你爸爸为你骄傲
Your father is so proud of you.

1155
01:27:00,770 --> 01:27:02,540
我上楼了
I'm going upstairs.

1156
01:27:11,380 --> 01:27:13,010
该死的  乔
God damn it, Joe.

1157
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:21,180
该号码已经变更
The number you have dialed has been changed.

1158
01:27:21,430 --> 01:27:24,830
该用户要求不提供新号码
The new number is unpublished at the subscriber's request.

1159
01:27:51,020 --> 01:27:53,920
老左  去办下手续好吗?
Hey, Left, get us checked in over there, will you?

1160
01:27:59,190 --> 01:28:01,880
-别走开  我去买张报纸  -好的
-Stick around. I'm going to get a paper. -All right.

1161
01:28:07,770 --> 01:28:11,570
天哪  霍兹曼律师走过来了
Jesus, Joe. That's Hollman, US Attorney, coming at us.

1162
01:28:11,710 --> 01:28:14,740
正向这边来了  怎么办?
The guy on the right. Christ, Joe, what are we going to do?

1163
01:28:15,680 --> 01:28:18,240
你干嘛不闭嘴? 我会搞定的
Why don't you just shut the fuck up? I'll take care of it.

1164
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:26,310
有任何事
Anything goes wrong down there,

1165
01:28:26,420 --> 01:28:30,020
让他们找纽约的人搞定
you have their people call your people in New York, understand?

1166
01:28:30,190 --> 01:28:33,030
不要芝麻大的事情都让我出面
I don't want to come down here and iron anything out.

1167
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:35,660
-你的机票呢? -乔 皮斯顿
-You got your plane tickets? -Joe Pistone.

1168
01:28:37,870 --> 01:28:40,030
你不记得我吗? 从南部来的...
Remember me? Southern District...

1169
01:28:40,170 --> 01:28:42,660
你他妈的找死吗?
What kind of fucking shit...

1170
01:28:44,280 --> 01:28:45,970
-你在干什么? -这他妈神经病
-What are you doing? -Grabbed my cock.

1171
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:47,070
我操
What the fuck!

1172
01:28:47,210 --> 01:28:50,650
别出声  他在执行任务
Shut up. He's working. Keep your mouth shut.

1173
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:54,140
变态杂种  敢来碰我
Fucking degenerate bastard. What a sick fuck. Grabbed my cock.

1174
01:28:54,250 --> 01:28:57,520
我要去酒吧经营的好些  久点也没关系
I want that club up and running. I don't care how long it takes.

1175
01:28:57,620 --> 01:28:59,890
有警察来了  快走
Here comes a fucking cop. Get the hell out of here.

1176
01:29:00,020 --> 01:29:03,080
小心点  票和东西拿好了吗?
Have a safe trip. You have the tickets and everything?

1177
01:29:05,530 --> 01:29:06,690
听我说
Listen to me.

1178
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:10,260
去打个电话  我要乘下班飞机回来  明白?
Get on the phone. Get me on the next flight back. Understand?

1179
01:29:10,940 --> 01:29:13,730
再叫我乔我会割断你的喉咙  明白吗?
Don't call me Joe again. I'll cut your fucking throat, understand?

1180
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:15,570
这个杂种
You piece of shit.

1181
01:29:49,570 --> 01:29:52,540
-爸爸? -宝贝
-Daddy? -Hi, baby.

1182
01:29:58,650 --> 01:30:00,710
-谁创造了你? -上帝创造了我
-Who made you? -God made me.

1183
01:30:01,420 --> 01:30:04,820
-上帝为什么创造你? -上帝为了显示他的仁慈
-Why did God make you? -God made me to show his goodness

1184
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:07,120
他给我欢乐
to make me happy with him in heaven.

1185
01:30:07,230 --> 01:30:09,820
-上帝在哪? -上帝无处不在
-Where is God? -God is everywhere.

1186
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:18,630
做个美梦吧  我的天使
Sweet dreams, angel.

1187
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:02,240
我要离婚
I want a divorce.

1188
01:31:05,850 --> 01:31:07,550
他总是不回家
He comes home at all hours of the night

1189
01:31:07,650 --> 01:31:11,320
三个月来  他去了哪儿  在做什么我一概不知
without announcing when, why, or where he's been for the last three months.

1190
01:31:13,160 --> 01:31:16,460
你知道他做什么? 他重新整理橱柜
And you know what he does? He rearranges the cabinets.

1191
01:31:17,700 --> 01:31:19,960
他重新铺床  用吸尘器清理房间
He remakes the bed. He vacuums the entire house.

1192
01:31:20,060 --> 01:31:23,190
见过有男人用吸尘器的吗? 那是不正常的
Do you know another man that vacuums? It's abnormal.

1193
01:31:23,330 --> 01:31:25,630
-太不正常了  -那你改电话号码...
-It's abnormal behavior. -Well, you know,

1194
01:31:25,740 --> 01:31:29,040
却不告诉丈夫却是正常的吗?
changing the phone number and not telling your husband is pretty normal.

1195
01:31:29,170 --> 01:31:32,270
-我不见你  你也别见我  -现在我知道什么感觉了
-I don't exist, you don't exist. -So now I know how it feels.

1196
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:36,380
不  我告诉你  我现在感觉好极了
No, now I know how you feel. I'll tell you something. It felt good.

1197
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:40,210
我现在知道控制着别人是什么感觉
Now I do know how it feels to be so in control.

1198
01:31:40,850 --> 01:31:43,150
我知道强势是什么感觉
Now I know how it feels to be strong.

1199
01:31:45,320 --> 01:31:47,310
-你喜换控制别人吗? -天哪
-You love control, don't you? -Oh, my God.

1200
01:31:47,430 --> 01:31:48,820
请你听着乔
Please, Joe, just listen.

1201
01:31:48,900 --> 01:31:51,680
让她先说  不然没完没了了
Otherwise you just play out the old pathology.

1202
01:31:54,230 --> 01:31:56,360
玛吉  你说乔常不在家
Maggie, you were saying Joe leaves.

1203
01:31:57,370 --> 01:31:58,890
是这样的
Yes, he leaves.

1204
01:32:00,470 --> 01:32:03,670
他把房子扔给我  替我和孩子付账
He leaves me with the house

1205
01:32:03,780 --> 01:32:07,340
可是这样并不是一个丈夫
and the kids and the bills, but not a husband.

1206
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:11,780
我需要的是丈夫
I want my husband.

1207
01:32:17,050 --> 01:32:19,750
你是在逃避什么?
What do you think you're running from?

1208
01:32:24,100 --> 01:32:27,530
-我没逃避什么  -没逃避什么?
-I ain't running from nothing. -"I ain't running from nothing."

1209
01:32:27,630 --> 01:32:30,760
听到了吗? 好歹你也读过大学
You hear yourself? The man I married was a college man.

1210
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:35,560
距离迫使玛吉开始充当追逐者的角色
Being the distancer forces Maggie into the role of the pursuer.

1211
01:32:36,010 --> 01:32:38,530
她开始觉得拥有权力
This gives you a feeling of power.

1212
01:32:38,910 --> 01:32:41,780
而你  却又开始反感
Simultaneously, you resent Maggie

1213
01:32:42,010 --> 01:32:44,060
玛吉的生理需要
for fulfilling her intimacy needs...

1214
01:32:44,060 --> 01:32:46,510
我是FBI密探  医生
I'm an undercover agent for the FBI, Doctor.

1215
01:32:47,820 --> 01:32:50,190
你跟黑手党的家伙狼狈为奸
You and your Mafia faggots can go screw each other.

1216
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:51,950
我不管了
I'm not gonna do it anymore.

1217
01:32:52,060 --> 01:32:53,610
我真希望你能帮她
I really hope that you can help her out

1218
01:32:53,720 --> 01:32:55,750
明明是她有问题  她才需要治疗
because obviously she's very sick. You can see that.

1219
01:32:55,860 --> 01:32:58,690
对  是我有病
Obviously, I'm the sick one.

1220
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:01,130
-你  -这样吧
-You. -Now,

1221
01:33:01,530 --> 01:33:06,090
星期一  三  五是你的亲切请求日
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday are Joe's intimacy days.

1222
01:33:06,740 --> 01:33:09,760
二  四  六是玛吉的
Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday are Maggie's.

1223
01:33:10,010 --> 01:33:13,640
你们要在自己的日期向对方亲切的请求
Now, on your day, you make an intimacy request.

1224
01:33:13,770 --> 01:33:15,560
比如帮我按摩一下了,或者别的什么
"Rub my back," or

1225
01:33:16,810 --> 01:33:19,980
孩子们真麻烦  能协助我吗?
"I have a problem with the kids. Could you help me out?"

1226
01:33:21,490 --> 01:33:23,780
你无忧无虑住在安全的屋子里
You sit around in your safe little fucking house

1227
01:33:23,890 --> 01:33:27,820
坐着安全的小车  和你那些狗屁朋友
with your safe little fucking station wagon, and your safe little friends.

1228
01:33:27,930 --> 01:33:30,420
一百一百的拿钱
You dream up the next $100 head fuck.

1229
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:34,000
-什么帮我按摩? -你这没良心的
-"Will you rub my back?" -You're an animal, do you know that?

1230
01:33:34,130 --> 01:33:37,430
-快上车去吧  -你知道吗?
-Just get in the fucking car. -Do you know that?

1231
01:33:38,470 --> 01:33:41,030
知道我想怎么提出亲切的请求?
You know what my intimacy request is for that guy?

1232
01:33:41,140 --> 01:33:42,330
非常亲切
It's very intimate.

1233
01:33:42,440 --> 01:33:45,170
我要把他给我的账单塞他屁眼里
He can take the bill he's gonna send me and shove it up his ass.

1234
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:47,180
你知道我们为什么要找他吗?
You want to know why we went to him?

1235
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:50,840
我希望他有个可以让我不离开的理由
I was hoping he could come up with one good reason for me not to leave you

1236
01:33:50,950 --> 01:33:53,080
因为我找不到
because I don't have one anymore.

1237
01:33:56,750 --> 01:33:59,020
什么? 你想离开我?
What? You gonna leave me?

1238
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:02,960
你想离开我  玛吉? 你别离开我
You gonna leave me, Maggie? You don't leave me.

1239
01:34:10,230 --> 01:34:11,670
-喂  -喂  安妮特
-Hello. -Hey, Annette.

1240
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:13,500
唐尼
Donnie.

1241
01:34:13,670 --> 01:34:15,800
-什么事? -你在哪儿?
-What's the matter? -Where are you?

1242
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:23,310
我在纽约  我不得不回来  怎么了?
I'm in New York. I had to come back. Why?

1243
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:27,180
-汤米...  -怎么? 出什么事了?
-It's Tommy. -Why, what's going on? What happened?

1244
01:34:27,820 --> 01:34:30,650
给你妹妹夹点蔬菜好吗? 谢谢
Can you give your sister some vegetables, honey? Thank you.

1245
01:34:30,790 --> 01:34:34,520
别用手  宝贝  还要什么吗?
Not with your fingers, sweetie. What else do you need?

1246
01:34:39,700 --> 01:34:42,600
我们今天上课学分数  知道吗?
We did fractions with Miss Greenberg today in class, you know?

1247
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:44,970
是吗? 分数?
Did you? Fractions?

1248
01:34:45,170 --> 01:34:49,440
-我测验得了95分  -好样的
-I got my test back and I got a 95. -Of course you did.

1249
01:34:56,340 --> 01:34:59,400
-出什么事了? -你来这做什么?
-What's going on? -Donnie, what are you doing here?

1250
01:34:59,510 --> 01:35:01,230
你不是应该在佛罗里达了么
You belong in Florida.

1251
01:35:01,340 --> 01:35:03,710
我听安妮特说了
I checked in with Annette and she said something...

1252
01:35:03,810 --> 01:35:05,790
你从佛罗里达打电话给她的吗?
You called her from Florida?

1253
01:35:05,790 --> 01:35:07,400
就在这儿  我有些事要办
I was up here. I had a few things to care of.

1254
01:35:07,810 --> 01:35:09,940
唐尼  你得回去
You got to go back. Come on.

1255
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:12,740
他没事吧? 他还好吧?
What happened to him? Is he gonna be all right?

1256
01:35:12,850 --> 01:35:14,220
我不清楚?
Do I know?

1257
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:17,350
他们挂了十二张图在墙上
They got 12 fucking diplomas on the wall,

1258
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:19,160
却他妈的什么也不说
and they can't tell you a fucking thing.

1259
01:35:19,860 --> 01:35:22,450
得了吧  就算汤米能出院
Forget about it. Tommy gets out of this fucking Bellevue,

1260
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:24,580
立刻又得回去
he's going right back to fucking up.

1261
01:35:24,690 --> 01:35:28,030
-他究竟怎么了? 嗑药过量? -不是这样
-What did he do? Did he overdose? -That ain't the question.

1262
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,190
嘴上插着塑料管
A plastic pipe in his mouth.

1263
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:37,030
无数根管子  还要靠机器呼吸
About five million tubes. They have a machine breathing for him.

1264
01:35:37,170 --> 01:35:41,040
医生在哪儿? 要我帮你找那些家伙谈谈吗?
Where's the fucking doctor? You want me to go talk to this guy for you?

1265
01:35:41,180 --> 01:35:43,340
找医生又能怎样? 打断他的腿吗?
Talk to the doctor? You gonna break his legs?

1266

-You're my man. I'm here for you. -I don't want you here, Donnie.

1271
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:04,160
你和汤米一样  都不愿听别人的话
You and Tommy is both peas in a fucking pod. You don't listen.

1272
01:36:05,070 --> 01:36:06,970
你们自己主意很大
You got your own ideas.

1273
01:36:07,170 --> 01:36:11,070
你们总是自以为是  什么都不当回事
You do what you want to do up on your high horses. Everything's a joke.

1274
01:36:16,280 --> 01:36:18,510
你还是回...
You go to La Guardia and you get back.

-你得了吧  -快滚
-Forget about it. -Go on!

1277
01:36:26,420 --> 01:36:29,480
我要留下陪你  你想教训我吗?
I'm gonna stay here with you. You want to kick the shit out of me?

1278
01:36:29,590 --> 01:36:31,790
我就坐在这儿  怎么样?
I'm gonna be right here. All right?

1279
01:36:45,810 --> 01:36:47,570
二十八年
Twenty eight years.

1280
01:36:48,610 --> 01:36:51,240
出生证上都写着
You can read it on his birth certificate.

1281
01:36:51,350 --> 01:36:54,940
贝尔维尤医院出生  现在要从这儿...回去了
Bellevue Hospital. Now he's back, in there.

1282
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:58,790
我现在担心的要死
And I'm out here, worried to my fucking death.

1283
01:36:59,290 --> 01:37:02,450
他现在躺在那儿  又跟二十八年前一样混沌未开了
And he's asleep in there, same as 28 years ago

1284
01:37:03,460 --> 01:37:05,360
还是一样
with the same expression.

1285
01:37:07,060 --> 01:37:08,620
一点没变化
He's made no progress.

1286
01:37:10,070 --> 01:37:12,060
这小子一点不知道上进
He ain't got no fucking respect.

1287
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:15,770
他是我儿子
He's my son.

1288
01:37:20,810 --> 01:37:24,440
他的心脏像手表一样停止了跳动
His heart stopped like a watch.

1289
01:37:25,770 --> 01:37:28,360
医生说的  就像手表一样
That's what the doctor said. Just like a watch.

1290
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:30,380
他们用尽所有方法把他救活
They had to wind it back up.

1291
01:37:31,670 --> 01:37:33,940
谁知道呢? 也许下一次
Who knows? Maybe next time,

1292
01:37:36,330 --> 01:37:37,720
就救不了了
they can't.

1293
01:38:01,650 --> 01:38:04,680
他会好起来的  他会好起来的
He's gonna be all right. He'll be all right.

1294
01:38:10,230 --> 01:38:11,720
我爱你  唐尼
I love you, Donnie.

I'm not talking to the Bureau. There is no Bureau.

1314

只有一群税务局混蛋和其他的混蛋
There's a bunch of assholes and the I.R.S. Is another bunch of assholes.

You tell this fucking auditor that I'm coming to D.C.

通常警察是蠢到...
Usually the cops are so fucking dumb.

1366
01:45:29,670 --> 01:45:32,930
事情过了三个月他们才会得到消息
It takes them three months just to get wind something's going on.

1367

-我们才刚开张...  -你觉得呢?
-We just opened the fucking doors. -What are you saying?

1373
01:45:51,250 --> 01:45:53,240
一定是有人卧底
There's got to be a snitch here.

1374
01:46:04,830 --> 01:46:06,130
是的
All right.

1375

1388
01:47:02,220 --> 01:47:04,780
-好  那我们稍后再谈  -好
-All right, look, I'll talk to you later. -Okay.

五百?
$500 scoot?

1400
01:47:59,350 --> 01:48:01,480
在佛罗里达  一小时就有五百进账
Down in Florida, it's $500 an hour.

1401
01:48:01,580 --> 01:48:04,420

1402
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:07,320

-What do you got there, Bullfrog? -Dime on the vig.

1403
01:48:07,890 --> 01:48:10,860
我们已经尽力了  桑尼

我以为我不能谈佛州的事
I thought we weren't supposed to talk about Florida.

1408
01:48:25,810 --> 01:48:27,300
你什么都没干?
So you never got nothing going on?

1409
01:48:27,410 --> 01:48:30,810

No. Nothing ever panned out for me, Sonny. I couldn't catch a break.

1410
01:48:30,910 --> 01:48:34,370
-你什么都做不来  -我那样说了吗?
-You never got nothing going on? -What did I just say?

我要那个有什么用?
What the fuck am I gonna do with razor blades?

1414
01:48:53,300 --> 01:48:55,770
你知道一辆车上能装多少刀片吗?
You know how many razor blades fit in a truck?

1415
01:48:55,870 --> 01:48:58,570

鲍利  我们用你的车
Paulie, we'll take your car.

1424
01:49:39,750 --> 01:49:43,710
红桑尼那老不死的在佛罗里达让我难堪
That cocksucker Sonny Red, he rubbed my nose in Florida

1425
01:49:43,850 --> 01:49:45,180
就因为有内鬼
because of a fucking rat!

1426
01:49:45,290 --> 01:49:46,620
得了吧
Forget about it.

唐尼  你坐前面

So where we headed, Sonny? Little Italy?

也许在跟一些比他还丑的婆娘上床
In bed with some broad with more hair on her lip than he's got on his head.

1440
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:13,230
-是你儿子  -别提这个
-He's your kid. -Don't remind me. Come on.

1441

你认为很好笑是吗? 我不觉得
You think that's funny? I don't think that's so funny.

1442
01:52:16,040 --> 01:52:17,160

Shit, the bulb is out. Watch your step, guys.

1447

别冒出个蜘蛛把我吓死才好
Big fucking surprise from a fucking spider.

1448
01:52:33,990 --> 01:52:36,690
对  黑桑那家伙灯会要被吓死了
Yeah, nothing like the surprise Sonny Black is gonna get.

1449
01:52:36,790 --> 01:52:39,230
-完全正确  -这里一枪
-You can say that again. -Put one right here.

1450
01:52:39,330 --> 01:52:41,190
他做梦也想不到
He'll never know what hit him.

1451
01:52:41,300 --> 01:52:43,730
-一点不错  -他绝对不知道谁打了他
-Goddamn right. -He's never gonna know what hit him.

1452
01:52:43,830 --> 01:52:46,430
-我会打他脑子打出来  -天哪  不
-I'll blow his brains right there. -Jesus! No!

1453
01:53:06,720 --> 01:53:08,380
布诺
Bruno!

1454

1456
01:53:39,490 --> 01:53:41,350
抓住我的手
Take my arm. Take my hand.

1457
01:53:43,430 --> 01:53:45,390
天哪
Jesus Christ.

1458
01:53:47,630 --> 01:53:50,500
鲍利  去叫唐尼
Paulie, go get Donnie.

1459

01:54:58,330 --> 01:55:00,030
下去
Get down there.

1464
01:55:01,500 --> 01:55:04,870
想要称王还轮不到他们
The meek want to inherit the earth, they're gonna have to get in fucking line.

1465
01:55:18,820 --> 01:55:20,250
看这是什么
Look what I found.

1466
01:55:21,120 --> 01:55:22,850
不是他们就是我们
Them or us.

1467
01:55:23,860 --> 01:55:25,790
尼克  你去锯大的
Nicky, you got Big Trin.

1468
01:55:25,960 --> 01:55:28,930
-我? 我要岔气的  -你闭嘴
-Trin? I'll get a hernia. -Shut the fuck up.

1469
01:55:29,200 --> 01:55:31,430
唐尼会帮你
Donnie's gonna help you.

1470
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:36,600
过来  唐尼
Come on, Donnie.

1471
01:55:36,770 --> 01:55:39,070
帮我锯这肥猪
Help me fillet this fat fuck.

1472
01:55:55,320 --> 01:55:57,590
好了  好了
All right, all right. Come on.

1473
01:55:58,030 --> 01:55:59,620
动手吧
We got work to do.

1474
01:56:46,040 --> 01:56:48,770
佛罗里达有人告密  唐尼
There was a rat in Florida, Donnie.

1475
01:56:51,210 --> 01:56:52,940
不是尼克
Nicky wasn't a rat.

1476
01:56:53,350 --> 01:56:55,780
别提名字
You don't mention his name, all right?

1477
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:59,090
谈事情的时候别提名字
That's what we said. We don't mention his name.

1478
01:56:59,720 --> 01:57:02,620
你怎么说都行  老左
Yeah. Tell yourself whatever you have to, Left.

1479
01:57:02,870 --> 01:57:04,640
我不是在跟自己说
I'm not telling myself.

1480
01:57:04,790 --> 01:57:07,890
-你也在  你也看到了  -杀了认识二十年的人
-You was down there. You have eyes. -Twenty years you know a guy.

1481
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:11,300
你还能悠闲的坐在这里
You fuck him, whack him out, just like that? Over a lounge?

1482
01:57:11,600 --> 01:57:14,130
-你真行啊  -他私下
-That's beautiful. -The man held out.

1483
01:57:15,040 --> 01:57:16,300
背着老板搞鬼
He held out on a coke deal.

1484
01:57:16,400 --> 01:57:18,570
这是两码事
What does one thing got to do with the other?

1485
01:57:18,670 --> 01:57:21,840
这点也足够让他被做了
He could have got whacked out just for that, for your information.

1486
01:57:21,940 --> 01:57:24,170
-佛州没有内鬼  -有
-There wasn't a rat in Florida. -There was a rat.

1487
01:57:24,280 --> 01:57:28,010
里基搞砸是因为他没有打通关系
There was not a rat in Florida. Richie fucked up paying off the cops.

1488
01:57:28,870 --> 01:57:30,390
你凭什么说是里基搞砸的
What do you mean Richie fucked up?

1489
01:57:30,520 --> 01:57:34,350
这就是为什么酒吧被捣  因为里基没有摆平该死的警察
That's why the club got busted. Richie didn't pay off the fucking cops.

1490
01:57:35,690 --> 01:57:37,950
尼克和这事无关
Nicky didn't have anything to do with it.

1491
01:57:38,060 --> 01:57:41,090
叫你别提名字  这是规矩
You don't mention his name. That's the rules.

1492
01:57:41,230 --> 01:57:44,200
-操他妈的规矩  -这可是行规  唐尼
-Fuck the rules. -That's the rules, Donnie.

1493
01:57:47,270 --> 01:57:48,430
说他的名字
Say his name.

1494
01:57:48,970 --> 01:57:50,670
-来啊  -说出他的名字
-Come on. -Say his name.

1495
01:57:50,770 --> 01:57:52,830
说啊
Come on. Nicky.

1496
01:57:53,540 --> 01:57:55,270
说尼克
Say Nicky.

1497
01:57:55,440 --> 01:57:58,210
你不敢说是因为我是对的
You can't say his name because you know that I'm fucking right.

1498
01:57:58,310 --> 01:58:00,250
说啊  说尼克
Say it! Say Nicky!

1499
01:58:01,650 --> 01:58:03,410
说他妈的名字
Say his fucking name!

1500
01:58:03,690 --> 01:58:08,090
尼克是内鬼  因为黑桑说他是
Nicky was a rat because Sonny Black says he was a rat.

1501
01:58:12,330 --> 01:58:13,990
我他妈是谁?
Who the fuck am I?

1502
01:58:16,670 --> 01:58:18,660
我是谁? 我就像...
Who am I?

1503
01:58:21,540 --> 01:58:23,970
轮子的刹车片
I'm a spoke on a wheel.

1504
01:58:25,040 --> 01:58:28,480
他也是  你也是
And so was he, and so are you.

1505
01:58:32,350 --> 01:58:34,610
别老踩着刹车了
Quit riding the fucking brake.

1506
01:58:57,370 --> 01:58:59,570
老板  老板
You the boss. You the boss, Boss.

1507
01:59:00,540 --> 01:59:03,070
-他看起来不错  -黑桑
-He looks good, huh? -Sonny Black.

1508
01:59:09,380 --> 01:59:12,410
恭喜你  桑尼
Congratulations, Sonny!

1509
01:59:12,590 --> 01:59:13,750
老板
Boss!

1510
01:59:17,190 --> 01:59:20,750
-桑尼  恭喜  -恭喜
-Sonny. Congratulations, Sonny. -Congratulations.

1511
01:59:30,610 --> 01:59:33,130
-天哪  -没事  玛吉
-Oh, God! -No, everything's okay, Maggie.

1512
01:59:34,140 --> 01:59:37,910
是吗? 没事你们来干什么?
Yeah? If everything's okay, what are you doing here?

1513
01:59:38,010 --> 01:59:40,380
介意我进去谈吗  皮斯顿太太?
Mind if we come inside, Mrs. Pistone?

1514
01:59:40,580 --> 01:59:42,480
我不知道  看情况了
I'm not sure. That depends.

1515
01:59:42,920 --> 01:59:45,110
从那时起  他变得疯疯癫癫了
At that point, he became hysterical.

1516
01:59:45,320 --> 01:59:48,120
他觉得局子对他被查税负有责任
As if the Bureau were responsible for this audit.

1517
01:59:48,210 --> 01:59:51,440
-其实也差不太多...  -你们想没想过给他加薪?
-Whereas, well, self-evidently... -Did you ever think of giving him a raise?

1518
01:59:51,540 --> 01:59:53,980
唯一给他加薪的办法是升职
The only way to give him a raise would be to upgrade him.

1519
01:59:54,100 --> 01:59:55,260
是
Yeah.

1520
01:59:55,430 --> 01:59:58,060
GS-14是主管级别  玛姬
GS-14 is a supervisor, Maggie.

1521
01:59:58,670 --> 02:00:00,160
原来他是主管了
So he's a supervisor.

1522
02:00:01,400 --> 02:00:04,770
但是他是卧底工作  手下没有人
But he's undercover. He's not supervising anyone.

1523
02:00:04,870 --> 02:00:07,470
问题在于  那是最后一次联系到他时的状况
The point is, that's the last time we heard from him.

1524
02:00:07,580 --> 02:00:10,910
标准程序是他每天要向我们汇报
Standard procedure is that he is to check in with us every day.

1525
02:00:11,010 --> 02:00:13,780
若是中断一两天也没事...
Maybe he might miss a day or two here and there, but...

1526
02:00:13,880 --> 02:00:16,680
-但这已经是三个星期了  -你告诉我
-It was three weeks ago. -I want you to tell me

1527
02:00:17,050 --> 02:00:18,950
我丈夫在哪儿
where my husband is.

1528
02:00:21,890 --> 02:00:23,950
我有权要你们告诉我
I demand that you tell me where my husband is!

1529
02:00:24,060 --> 02:00:26,790
-我们也不知道  -若他跟你联系
-We can't tell you because we don't know. -If he gets in touch with you,

1530
02:00:26,900 --> 02:00:29,490
请你跟他讲明
you have got to try to talk sense into him.

1531
02:00:29,600 --> 02:00:32,400
皮斯顿太太  请你协助我们
Mrs. Pistone, please help us here.

1532
02:00:32,530 --> 02:00:34,730
-你要我协助你们? -是的
-You want me to help you out? -Yes.

1533
02:00:35,300 --> 02:00:39,400
要我协助榨干了我丈夫的联邦调查局?
You want me to help out the FBI that used my husband and sucked him dry,

1534
02:00:39,540 --> 02:00:42,170
帮你们的领导升官
so that a bunch of supervisors could become SACs

1535
02:00:42,280 --> 02:00:45,410
也让检察官升为法官
and prosecutors could become judges and assholes like you

1536
02:00:45,750 --> 02:00:48,510
然后你们这些混蛋就可以升为主管?
could get promoted to GS-16?

1537
02:00:48,750 --> 02:00:51,010
玛姬  别这样  不是那个意思
Maggie, come on. You don't mean that.

1538
02:00:53,220 --> 02:00:55,780
我来告诉你  我希望他反叛
Let me tell you something. I hope he crossed over.

1539
02:00:55,890 --> 02:00:58,670
皮斯顿女士  乔打入的黑手党
Mrs. Pistone, there is a war going on in the Mafia family

1540
02:00:58,670 --> 02:01:00,050
发生了家族内战
where Joe is undercover.

1541
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:02,760
内战中三个敌对的头目被杀
Three leaders of a rival faction have been murdered.

1542
02:01:02,860 --> 02:01:05,730
他参与了火拼  不是以探员的身份
He's right in the line of fire. Not because he's one of us,

1543
02:01:05,830 --> 02:01:06,960
而是以黑帮的身份
because he's one of them.

1544
02:01:07,070 --> 02:01:11,000
并且成为他们的头目之一
Who he's with and who he's close to, they're all the top dogs now.

1545
02:01:13,170 --> 02:01:15,300
这是我们始料不及的
It's just not a problem we anticipated.

1546
02:01:15,410 --> 02:01:17,210
我们要把他挽救出来
We have got to pull him out.

1547
02:01:17,350 --> 02:01:21,150
你要跟他谈谈  他会听你的
You have got to talk to him. He'll listen to you.

1548
02:01:21,520 --> 02:01:22,680
你们是这样想的吗?
You think so?

1549
02:01:26,720 --> 02:01:28,660
他一周前回来过
He was here a week ago.

1550
02:01:31,030 --> 02:01:33,860
他悄悄摸进来时我已经睡了
He snuck into the house after I was asleep.

1551
02:01:36,230 --> 02:01:39,460
他没有惊醒我  连句好也没问
And he didn't even wake me up, didn't even say hello to me.

1552
02:01:44,210 --> 02:01:46,500
他拿了件运动服就走了
He came to get his sport coat.

1553
02:02:01,390 --> 02:02:04,220
-我们出去走走  -好的
-Let's take a walk. -All right.

1554
02:02:08,260 --> 02:02:10,030
老左  去哪儿?
Left, what are we doing?

1555
02:02:10,130 --> 02:02:13,400
边走边谈吧  附近人多眼杂
We're gonna walk and talk. We got too many eyes around here.

1556
02:02:16,800 --> 02:02:21,070
是这样  唐尼  红桑的儿子布诺不见了
Here it is, Donnie. Sonny Red's kid, Bruno. He's disappeared.

1557
02:02:21,440 --> 02:02:24,900
一天不把他找回来
Now, as long as he's on the loose,

1558
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:26,620
我们就一天不安全
ain't none of us safe.

1559
02:02:27,280 --> 02:02:29,080
-懂吗? -是的
-Right? -Yeah.

1560
02:02:29,180 --> 02:02:31,620
没有那家伙的消息吗?
You got no idea where the guy is?

1561
02:02:31,820 --> 02:02:35,850
那家伙是个瘾君子  总会露面的
He's got a nickel-a-day coke habit. He's gonna turn up somewhere.

1562
02:02:36,860 --> 02:02:40,660
好在  我们接了这事
Anyway, we got the contract.

1563
02:02:44,470 --> 02:02:46,960
这事如果干的好
Now, this thing gets done right,

1564
02:02:47,070 --> 02:02:50,700
下次有位置我就的推举你
when the books open up, I'm proposing you for membership.

1565
02:02:51,210 --> 02:02:54,330
-懂我意思吗? -懂
-You know what that means? -Yeah.

1566
02:02:54,480 --> 02:02:56,170
真的? 说说看?
Yeah? What?

1567
02:02:56,310 --> 02:03:00,510
-你希望我不能有闪失  -你总算明白了
-It means I can't fuck it up. -You read my mind.

1568
02:03:01,420 --> 02:03:05,650
-你总算懂了  千万别搞砸  -我不会的
-You read my mind. You can't fuck it up. -No, I won't fuck it up.

1569
02:03:11,090 --> 02:03:13,220
你会有出息的  唐尼
You're gonna be a made guy, Donnie.

1570
02:03:13,510 --> 02:03:14,710
明白吗?
Capisce?

1571
02:03:15,800 --> 02:03:18,060
是的
Yeah. All right.

1572
02:03:18,800 --> 02:03:20,430
是的
Yeah. All right.

1573
02:03:21,140 --> 02:03:24,040
来  我们回里面去
Come on. Let's go back inside!

1574
02:03:28,110 --> 02:03:30,200
-老左  -什么事?
-Left. -Yeah, what?

1575
02:03:33,480 --> 02:03:36,010
什么事? 冻死我了
What? I'm freezing here!

1576
02:03:39,790 --> 02:03:42,590
你还记得那条伯伦特游船吗?
You know that boat you used to have, that Bertram?

1577
02:03:43,730 --> 02:03:45,560
-船? 船怎么了? -是的
-Boat? What about it? -Yeah, boat.

1578
02:03:45,660 --> 02:03:49,890
你看看那要多少钱?
How much is it? A boat like that? How much? What do you think?

1579
02:03:51,070 --> 02:03:54,030
买条那种二手船大概三十万吧
You could get a sports fisherman for maybe 300, used.

1580
02:03:54,140 --> 02:03:56,470
你问这个干嘛  唐尼?
Why are you asking me about boats, Donnie?

1581
02:03:56,570 --> 02:03:58,700
我只是好奇  我一直这样的
I was just wondering. I was curious, you know.

1582
02:03:58,810 --> 02:04:00,500
-你对船好奇吗? -是的
-You're curious about boats? -Yeah.

1583
02:04:00,610 --> 02:04:02,770
外面只有10度  我快冻死了
It's 10 degrees out here. I'm freezing.

1584
02:04:02,880 --> 02:04:05,870
我刚和你说这么严肃的话题  你现在就只想问船的事?
You're asking me about boats, after what we just said?

1585
02:04:06,180 --> 02:04:08,840
你糊涂了还是怎么的?
You losing your marbles on me or what?

1586
02:04:08,980 --> 02:04:11,780
-不  我很好  -那就别这样问
-No, I'm all right. -So don't ask questions like that.

1587
02:04:11,890 --> 02:04:14,010
-那样很疯狂  不是吗? -好吧
-That's crazy, okay? -Yeah.

1588
02:04:14,160 --> 02:04:17,680
你做了这混蛋然后把他扔在街上  来吧
You hit this cocksucker, and you leave him in the street. Come on.

1589
02:05:20,760 --> 02:05:23,820
-能告诉我你在干什么吗? -不  回去睡吧
-You want to tell me what's going on? -Nothing. Go back to bed.

1590
02:05:23,930 --> 02:05:26,950
我找点东西  好吗? 一会就好
I'm looking for something, all right? I'll be right in.

1591
02:05:27,730 --> 02:05:30,360
这样不是办法
That's not gonna work anymore.

1592
02:05:32,670 --> 02:05:33,690
包在哪儿?
Where is it?

1593
02:05:33,800 --> 02:05:36,130
包里有三十万
There's $300,000 in that bag.

1594
02:05:37,770 --> 02:05:40,740
你怎会知道包里东西的?
How do you know what's in that bag?

1595
02:05:41,510 --> 02:05:42,600
我数过了
I counted it.

1596
02:05:42,710 --> 02:05:43,730
-是吗? -是的
-Yeah? -Yeah.

1597
02:05:43,850 --> 02:05:45,470
-数出来? -是的
-You counted it? -Yeah.

1598
02:05:45,610 --> 02:05:48,410
你说数了是什么意思? 那和你没关
What do you mean, you counted it? It's none of your business.

1599
02:05:48,520 --> 02:05:51,950
不是我的生意? 这是我的房子  谁说不关我的事?
Not my business? It's in my house. Who'd ever believe it wasn't my business?

1600
02:05:52,050 --> 02:05:54,020
玛吉  给我那该死的包
I want that fucking bag, Maggie.

1601
02:05:54,160 --> 02:05:58,320
拿不到那包里的30万元FBI的人不会走的
FBI men do not walk around with $300,000 in a bag.

1602
02:05:58,990 --> 02:06:01,030
乔  你会被抓去会坐牢的
Joe, you could go to jail for this.

1603
02:06:01,030 --> 02:06:02,390
闭嘴  没人会坐牢
Shut the fuck up. Nobody's going to jail.

1604
02:06:02,500 --> 02:06:04,970
你不为你孩子想想吗?
Did you think about your children for a second?

1605
02:06:05,070 --> 02:06:07,630
-你不懂怎么回事  -我不懂?
-You have no idea what you're talking about. -I don't?

1606
02:06:07,740 --> 02:06:10,500
-那包是别人的  -是吗? 谁的?
-The bag belongs to somebody else. -Does it? Who?

1607
02:06:10,810 --> 02:06:13,540
-这包是谁的? -我的最好的一个倒霉伙计
-Whose bag is it, Joe? -One of my best... Just some fucked-up guy.

1608
02:06:13,640 --> 02:06:17,670
-哪个倒霉蛋会要三十万? -那包在哪儿?
-A fucked-up guy needs $300,000? -Yeah, right. Where's the goddamn bag?

1609
02:06:19,550 --> 02:06:22,210
你像他们一样了  你知道吗?
You're becoming like them, you know that?

1610
02:07:00,790 --> 02:07:04,120
你知道我是怎么过日子的吗?
Did you ever once ask yourself how I make it through my days?

1611
02:07:04,930 --> 02:07:07,090
我当我自己是寡妇...
I pretend I'm a widow

1612
02:07:07,460 --> 02:07:10,560
抱着奖章和回忆过日子
with medals and scrapbooks and memories.

1613
02:07:12,830 --> 02:07:14,390
我当你已经死了
I pretend you're dead.

1614
02:07:14,800 --> 02:07:17,330
那就是我的生活
That's how my life makes sense to me.

1615
02:07:18,340 --> 02:07:20,470
你走吧  离我远点
Just go away. Stay away.

1616
02:07:36,160 --> 02:07:39,350
天  我这样爱你  你却如此恨我?
God, why do you hate me when I love you so much?

1617
02:07:45,330 --> 02:07:47,160
你以为我恨你?
You think I hate you?

1618
02:07:48,340 --> 02:07:50,100
我不恨你
I don't hate you.

1619
02:07:56,540 --> 02:07:58,540
是这份工作逼我这样
This job is eating me alive.

1620
02:07:59,480 --> 02:08:01,210
没有丝毫的喘息
I can't breathe anymore.

1621
02:08:04,750 --> 02:08:07,080
如果我不出现  老左就没命了
And if I come out, this guy Lefty dies.

1622
02:08:09,790 --> 02:08:12,990
他们会杀了他  因为是他担保的我
They're gonna kill him, because he vouched for me,

1623
02:08:13,090 --> 02:08:14,860
是他在护着我
because he stood up for me.

1624
02:08:16,530 --> 02:08:18,360
我天天跟他在一起
I live with that every day.

1625
02:08:20,600 --> 02:08:23,700
我要不管等于亲手杀了他  懂吗?
That's the same thing as if I put the bullet in his head myself, understand?

1626
02:08:26,390 --> 02:08:29,020
我花了这么多年想做回一个好人
I spent all these years trying to be the good guy.

1627
02:08:29,140 --> 02:08:31,740
清白干净的人
You know, the man in the white fucking hat.

1628
02:08:32,610 --> 02:08:33,840
为了什么?
For what?

1629
02:08:36,820 --> 02:08:38,010
什么都不为
For nothing.

1630
02:08:43,220 --> 02:08:46,190
我不是变得像他们  玛姬  我根本就是他们
I'm not becoming like them, Maggie. I am them.

1631
02:09:24,870 --> 02:09:26,800
老左? 唐尼
Left? Donnie.

1632
02:09:26,900 --> 02:09:28,600
是唐尼  你在哪儿  唐尼?
Donnie? Where you been?

1633
02:09:28,700 --> 02:09:30,530
你听着
Yeah, look...

1634
02:09:31,010 --> 02:09:33,700
-我要见你  -正好  你快来
-I gotta see you. -You're right, you gotta see me.

1635
02:09:33,810 --> 02:09:35,800
-我们发现红桑的儿子了  -布诺?
-We found Sonny Red's kid. -Bruno?

1636
02:09:35,910 --> 02:09:38,640
是的  他在斯顿岛的一条小船上
Yeah, he's on a boat on Staten Island.

1637
02:09:38,750 --> 02:09:41,310
-我来接你  -没时间了  唐尼
-I'll pick you up. -We don't have time, Donnie.

1638
02:09:41,420 --> 02:09:42,710
-我们到那儿见  -好的
-You meet me there. -Okay.

1639
02:10:06,870 --> 02:10:09,780
布诺在那儿  他就在码头的那头
Bruno's here. He's down the end of the pier.

1640
02:10:11,280 --> 02:10:14,210
我们要等一会儿  等他开始享受
We'll wait here a minute while he has his drink.

1641
02:10:14,980 --> 02:10:17,210
等他困了
Let him get a little sleepy.

1642
02:10:18,550 --> 02:10:22,010
-我也困了  -他的船在哪儿?
-I'm getting a little sleepy myself. -How's his boat?

1643
02:10:22,720 --> 02:10:24,520
-船? -是的
-The boat? -Yeah.

1644
02:10:25,330 --> 02:10:26,620
好了
Nice.

1645
02:10:27,600 --> 02:10:31,460
得了吧  我最了解船
Forget about it. One thing I know is boats.

1646
02:10:32,030 --> 02:10:35,830
我想揍他一顿  把他扔到水里  把船抢过来
I'd like to pop him, throw him in the water, take the fucking boat.

1647
02:10:38,210 --> 02:10:42,730
以前你怎么说的? 再有机会弄到那船...
Remember you said a couple of times how if you had that Bertram again,

1648
02:10:43,440 --> 02:10:47,310
你会带安妮特去码头  上船就走
you'd drive down to the pier with Annette and just go?

1649
02:10:47,520 --> 02:10:51,210
还记得吗? 到天涯海角  谁也找不到
Remember you said that? North, south, east, west, nobody'd ever find you.

1650
02:10:51,320 --> 02:10:54,520
那是以前了  别提以前的事
That was before. Don't remind me about that now.

1651
02:10:54,660 --> 02:10:57,680
-我只是想说...  -我不愿意再去想那事
-Yeah, but I'm just saying... -I don't want to think about that.

1652
02:10:57,790 --> 02:10:59,280
那你想过吗?
Did you mean it?

1653
02:11:00,390 --> 02:11:01,520
想?
Mean it?

1654
02:11:01,900 --> 02:11:04,560
我是洛克菲勒吗? 我要买一艘船?
Who am I? Rockefeller? I'm gonna go buy a boat?

1655
02:11:05,070 --> 02:11:07,500
-假如行呢  老左? -什么假如
-I'm saying, what if, Left? -What if.

1656
02:11:07,640 --> 02:11:08,930
假如...
What if...

1657
02:11:09,470 --> 02:11:13,600
我是说假如我手上有些东西  一些珠宝
I mean, I got a couple of things going on the side. A couple of jewel things.

1658
02:11:14,840 --> 02:11:17,640
也许我就能帮你搞到钱
Maybe I could get that kind of money for you.

1659
02:11:20,580 --> 02:11:22,670
你想挣钱替我买条船?
You're gonna find money for me to get a boat?

1660
02:11:22,780 --> 02:11:25,150
-也许  -也许?
-Maybe. -Yeah?

1661
02:11:26,050 --> 02:11:28,320
那说明你很慷慨  唐尼
That would be real generous of you, Donnie.

1662
02:11:28,420 --> 02:11:32,590
那我现在就把一袋钱给你呢?
What if I could hand you a bagful of money right now?

1663
02:11:33,860 --> 02:11:35,760
知道我在说什么吗?
You know what I'm saying?

1664
02:11:37,730 --> 02:11:39,830
你可以脱离这种生活
You could leave this life.

1665
02:11:40,330 --> 02:11:42,390
你自己说过  老左  假如你不能跳出来
You said it yourself, if you don't move up,

1666
02:11:42,500 --> 02:11:44,470
每天都会有同样的压力
every day you're looking over your shoulder.

1667
02:11:44,570 --> 02:11:45,940
你不知道会发生什么?
You don't know what's gonna happen.

1668
02:11:46,040 --> 02:11:47,670
-唐尼  你听我说  -少废话
-Donnie, listen to me. -No more bullshit.

1669
02:11:47,780 --> 02:11:49,470
我说该结束这种生活了  老左
Get out of this life is what I'm saying, Left.

1670
02:11:49,580 --> 02:11:52,100
-我想给你看一些东西  唐尼  -什么东西
-I'm gonna show you something, Donnie. -What?

1671
02:11:52,210 --> 02:11:55,050
我要你非常仔细的看
I want you to look at it very carefully.

1672
02:11:56,280 --> 02:11:59,740
然后再认真想想
And then I want you to think very carefully

1673
02:12:01,090 --> 02:12:03,420
你曾对我说的话
about what you say to me.

1674
02:12:07,430 --> 02:12:09,730
这是一艘FBI的船  唐尼
That's a Federal boat, Donnie.

1675
02:12:20,040 --> 02:12:22,630
-我不认为那是同一条船  -那是同一条船
-I really don't think that's the same boat... -That's the same boat.

1676
02:12:22,740 --> 02:12:25,370
我名字就在上面  "左撇子"
It's got the name on it, The Left Hand.

1677
02:12:25,480 --> 02:12:27,470
我名字一样
It's like my name.

1678
02:12:28,850 --> 02:12:31,110
就是那条阿巴斯康
That's that Abscam boat.

1679
02:12:33,190 --> 02:12:35,780
你认为我知那是FBI的船?
You think I knew that was a Federal boat?

1680
02:12:37,360 --> 02:12:39,620
你认为我是卧底?
You think I'm a fucking rat?

1681
02:12:39,990 --> 02:12:43,490
我让你去我家多少次了?
How many times I have you into my own house?

1682
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:47,730
至少每周两次  怎么了?
Twice a week, at least. Why?

1683
02:12:47,840 --> 02:12:50,240
说得对  "至少"
There it is, "At least."

1684
02:12:52,240 --> 02:12:54,000
-我弄给你吃  -是的
-I cook for you. -Yeah.

1685
02:12:55,240 --> 02:12:57,570
有钱的时候  分给你用...
If ever I had any money, I'd give you.

1686
02:12:58,410 --> 02:13:01,310
虽然我穷...但我有钱的时候...
I never had any money. But if ever I had...

1687
02:13:01,420 --> 02:13:05,180
我有一百  会分你五十  对吧?
$100 in my pocket, I gave you $50, right?

1688
02:13:06,450 --> 02:13:08,980
-算  是吧  -如果你是卧底...
-Yeah, you did. -If you're a rat...

1689
02:13:19,970 --> 02:13:21,740
如果你真是卧底
If you're a rat,

1690
02:13:21,740 --> 02:13:24,400
我就是黑帮史上最大的傻瓜
then I'm the biggest fucking mutt in the history of the Mafia.

1691
02:13:25,210 --> 02:13:28,000
老左  如果那真是FBI的船
Even if this thing is a Federal boat, Left,

1692
02:13:29,610 --> 02:13:33,010
也是他们搞了其他人
they scam all these other people. They didn't scam us.

1693
02:13:33,110 --> 02:13:34,910
你明白我的意思吗?
You know what I'm saying?

1694
02:13:36,450 --> 02:13:38,920
我们去了  玩爽了  而且我们也脱身了
We went. We had a great party. We walked away from it.

1695
02:13:42,360 --> 02:13:45,590
你怎么知道我们真的脱身了
How do you know that we walked away from it?

1696
02:13:45,760 --> 02:13:47,780
我们不是正坐在这儿吗?
We're sitting here, right?

1697
02:13:48,530 --> 02:13:51,590
他们想算计我们  但是被我们耍了
So they tried to outsmart us, but we outsmarted them.

1698
02:13:53,270 --> 02:13:55,170
我们打败了那些探员
We beat the agents.

1699
02:13:59,110 --> 02:14:00,800
你应该相信我
You gotta believe me.

1700
02:14:11,620 --> 02:14:12,780
那好
Okay.

1701
02:14:15,890 --> 02:14:17,590
咱们去做事吧
Let's go do this work.

1702
02:14:18,860 --> 02:14:20,830
先做完再说
Get this over with.

1703
02:14:27,100 --> 02:14:29,430
用两个手指按在这里  就像按按钮
Two in back of the ear. Like pushing a button.

1704
02:14:29,540 --> 02:14:31,060
叭  叭  就这样
Bing, bing. That's it.

1705
02:14:31,210 --> 02:14:32,900
-好的  -别缩手缩脚
-Yeah. -Don't freeze up.

1706
02:14:33,540 --> 02:14:35,170
-别缩手缩脚好吗? -不会的
-You gonna freeze up? -No.

1707
02:14:35,280 --> 02:14:37,970
-很多人会这样  -我没问题的
-A lot of guys freeze up. -I'll be all right.

1708
02:14:38,080 --> 02:14:41,100
我说了你是卧底吗? 我不敢相信你居然提这事
Did I say you was a rat? I can't believe you brought that up.

1709
02:14:41,220 --> 02:14:42,980
得了吧  老左
Come on. Forget about it, Left.

1710
02:14:43,080 --> 02:14:45,350
我从没说你是卧底
I never said you was a rat.

1711
02:14:45,590 --> 02:14:47,140
我是你的好朋友
I'm your best friend.

1712
02:14:49,420 --> 02:14:51,550
来吧  咱们动手吧
Come on. Let's go do this thing.

1713
02:15:32,470 --> 02:15:34,830
快动手啊  唐尼
Come on, Donnie. Come on.

1714
02:15:36,370 --> 02:15:38,270
快下手  唐尼
Gotta do it, Don.

1715
02:15:40,240 --> 02:15:41,870
快  唐尼
Come on, Don.

1716
02:15:42,480 --> 02:15:43,530
快点
Now!

1717
02:15:44,480 --> 02:15:46,210
动手啊
Come on.

1718
02:15:47,650 --> 02:15:50,140
FBI  都别动
FBI! Freeze!

1719
02:15:51,420 --> 02:15:52,510
妈的
Shit!

1720
02:15:56,760 --> 02:15:59,730
别说  什么也别说  唐尼  什么也别说  唐尼
Don't say nothing, Donnie. Don't say nothing to them.

1721
02:16:02,730 --> 02:16:04,600
什么也别说  唐尼
Don't tell them nothing, Donnie!

1722
02:16:04,700 --> 02:16:06,390
什么也别说  唐尼
Donnie, don't say nothing!

1723
02:16:06,530 --> 02:16:10,230
-结束了 -滚  还没有
-It's over. -Fuck you, it's not over. I'm not coming out.

1724
02:16:10,370 --> 02:16:14,030
在那里呆上二十四小时就没事了
There'll be a mouthpiece there in 24 hours! Donnie, you're all right!

1725
02:16:14,140 --> 02:16:15,900
-操  -小子  你完了
-Shit! -It's over, man!

1726
02:16:16,040 --> 02:16:18,410
什么也别说  唐尼
Don't say nothing to them, Donnie!

1727
02:16:18,650 --> 02:16:20,550
结束了  乔
It's over, Joe.

1728
02:17:02,690 --> 02:17:06,750
你们认识的这个唐尼 布拉斯科  那不是他的真名
You've known this guy as Donnie Brasco. That's not his real name.

1729
02:17:08,860 --> 02:17:11,920
其实  他是FBI探员
Truth is, he's been an FBI agent all along.

1730
02:17:15,200 --> 02:17:18,540
有什么想说的话  就来找我吧
You can contact me here if you want to talk.

1731
02:18:08,620 --> 02:18:11,020
你们相信这些家伙的话吗?
Can you believe those fucking guys?

1732
02:18:11,930 --> 02:18:14,020
唐尼不可能是特工
There's no way Donnie's an agent.

1733
02:18:15,600 --> 02:18:17,760
真是一派胡言  是吗?
It's a nice fucking bluff, huh?

1734
02:18:18,400 --> 02:18:21,230
那条船是个圈套  他们安排好的
That boat was a set-up. They set the boat up.

1735
02:18:21,600 --> 02:18:23,760
是吗? 想让我们以为他是卧底
See? Then we think Donnie's a rat.

1736
02:18:29,010 --> 02:18:31,410
差点让我上当
Almost had me going,

1737
02:18:32,410 --> 02:18:34,110
如果你不了解唐尼的话
if you didn't know Donnie.

1738
02:18:36,580 --> 02:18:38,740
是的  如果你不了解唐尼的话
Right, if I didn't know Donnie.

1739
02:19:01,840 --> 02:19:04,210
鬣狗杀害了很多年幼的猎豹
Hyenas kill many young cheetahs

1740
02:19:04,340 --> 02:19:08,180
数量众多的鬣狗甚至能打败雌豹并攻击幼崽
and more than one could overpower the mother and turn on the cubs.

1741
02:19:19,860 --> 02:19:20,990
喂?
Yeah?

1742
02:19:22,860 --> 02:19:24,660
好吧
Yeah. All right.

1743
02:19:26,070 --> 02:19:27,530
好吧  就这样
All right. Okay.

1744
02:19:35,580 --> 02:19:37,670
是我的吗?
Was that for me?

1745
02:19:38,380 --> 02:19:42,340
不是  要去看望一个朋友
No. It was a guy I got to go see.

1746
02:19:42,780 --> 02:19:45,840
-这么晚还要出去吗? -没办法
-So late? -What am I gonna do?

1747
02:19:47,720 --> 02:19:49,350
谁知道是这些人怎么回事?
Who knows with these people?

1748
02:19:49,460 --> 02:19:51,390
-宝贝  不用等我  -不等吗?
-Honey, don't wait up for me tonight. -No?

1749
02:19:51,490 --> 02:19:53,520
我不知道要去多久
I don't know how long I'm gonna be.

1750
02:19:53,630 --> 02:19:55,460
你听着
And listen to me.

1751
02:20:00,830 --> 02:20:02,730
如果唐尼打电话来
If Donnie calls

1752
02:20:03,840 --> 02:20:05,400
你告诉他...
tell him

1753
02:20:10,740 --> 02:20:12,910
如果确有其人的话
if it was going to be anyone,

1754
02:20:14,280 --> 02:20:17,270
我很高兴是他  好吗?
I'm glad it was him, all right?

1755
02:20:17,650 --> 02:20:19,620
你看上去真迷人
Look how beautiful you look.

1756
02:20:20,150 --> 02:20:22,310
-再见  -再见  本
-Goodbye. -Bye, Ben.

1757
02:22:09,830 --> 02:22:11,660
对不起  皮斯顿太太
Excuse me, Mrs. Pistone.

1758
02:22:12,470 --> 02:22:14,090
请坐
Have a seat.

1759
02:22:19,010 --> 02:22:22,200
-为表彰探员乔...  -只有三十秒
-"To Special Agent Joseph..." -Thirty seconds, sir.

1760
02:22:22,910 --> 02:22:27,510
乔瑟夫・D・皮斯顿所作出的突出贡献
"Joseph D. Pistone, in grateful recognition for meritorious service."

1761
02:22:27,680 --> 02:22:32,310
请允许我特颁发奖章和五百元奖金
Allow me to present you with this medal and this check for $500.

1762
02:22:32,420 --> 02:22:33,850
支票举高点
Hold the check up.

1763
02:22:34,920 --> 02:22:38,190
-恭喜你  孩子  -恭喜你  乔
-Congratulations again, son. -Congratulations, Joe.

1764
02:22:39,490 --> 02:22:42,520
-太太  请你照顾好他  -我会的
-Ma'am, take good care of him. -I will.

1765
02:22:42,900 --> 02:22:44,360
皮斯顿太太
Mrs. Pistone.

1766
02:23:23,400 --> 02:23:24,960
都过去了
It's over.

1767
02:23:26,670 --> 02:23:28,730
来吧  宝贝  回家吧
Come on, honey. Come home.
