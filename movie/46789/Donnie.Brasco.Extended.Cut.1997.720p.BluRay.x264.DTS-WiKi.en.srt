ÖÒ¼éÈË

1
00:03:21,656 --> 00:03:24,147
You're not saying things
that mean anything.

2
00:03:24,392 --> 00:03:27,361
It's not even a debate.
It's a better automobile!

3
00:03:27,462 --> 00:03:30,829
Ain't no way you can say to me
a Lincoln is better than a Cadillac.

4
00:03:31,232 --> 00:03:34,963
- A Lincoln is better. It's a better automobile.
- Forget about it.

5
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:39,870
A Cadillac's got more acceleration.
It's got more power.

6
00:03:39,974 --> 00:03:41,407
It's got better handling.

7
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:44,944
It's got more legroom for your legs.
It's got more power.

8
00:03:45,045 --> 00:03:46,273
- You just said that.
- Bingo.

9
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,870
- What?
- You just said, "More power."

10
00:03:47,981 --> 00:03:49,710
- You're starting to repeat yourself.
- I said that?

11
00:03:49,816 --> 00:03:52,546
- You're getting senile.
- He got me so fucking aggravated.

12
00:03:52,653 --> 00:03:55,281
I'll tell you one thing,
Mercedes got it all over both of them.

13
00:03:55,389 --> 00:03:56,378
A Mercedes?

14
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:59,459
A Lincoln's like driving a fucking water bed,
for Christ's sakes.

15
00:03:59,559 --> 00:04:02,858
- A Mercedes.
- Yeah. It's a good car.

16
00:04:08,435 --> 00:04:12,790
I'll tell you one thing, my friend.
Undisputable. The Lincoln is longer.

17
00:04:13,559 --> 00:04:16,153
It's longer? Longer like what?
Longer like my dick is longer?

18
00:04:16,262 --> 00:04:18,093
No, no, no. We're not talking about
a Volkswagen.

19
00:04:18,197 --> 00:04:19,926
What do you mean? Yeah, Volkswagen.

20
00:04:20,033 --> 00:04:22,968
Longer. Like longer.
Like in inches it's longer.

21
00:04:23,069 --> 00:04:24,627
- You don't make no fucking sense.
- It's a longer car.

22
00:04:24,737 --> 00:04:27,296
Two fucking cars, right?
This is a car, this is a car, right?

23
00:04:27,406 --> 00:04:28,430
Right here, okay?

24
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:32,670
All things being equal,
the one's longer gonna get there first.

25
00:04:32,778 --> 00:04:34,268
You don't have to be fucking Einstein
to understand this.

26
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:36,108
You know what happens
when you get there, don't you?

27
00:04:36,214 --> 00:04:38,409
- No.
- You're still driving a fucking Lincoln.

28
00:04:38,517 --> 00:04:41,953
I'll show you a fucking picture.
Two cars. The one's longer gets there first.

29
00:04:42,054 --> 00:04:44,352
That's a scientific fact. It's a longer car.

30
00:04:44,456 --> 00:04:46,356
- Can I ask you guys something?
- What?

31
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:49,450
Are you guys, you know, wise guys?

32
00:04:50,762 --> 00:04:53,162
Wise guys? What are wise guys?

33
00:04:54,232 --> 00:04:57,065
- You know...
- What makes you think we're wise guys?

34
00:04:57,469 --> 00:04:58,800
We could be cops.

35
00:04:59,638 --> 00:05:00,605
Yeah.

36
00:05:04,276 --> 00:05:07,040
- You believed me. Undercover what?
- No, I didn't.

37
00:05:08,413 --> 00:05:10,607
- You believed me.
- No, it's just...

38
00:05:11,215 --> 00:05:13,012
- Who's that over there?
- Who?

39
00:05:13,551 --> 00:05:15,781
The guy by the bar with the mustache.

40
00:05:16,253 --> 00:05:19,381
That's Don, Don the Jeweler.
Jilly brought him here.

41
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,321
What Jilly? Jilly "Four-eyes"?

42
00:05:21,425 --> 00:05:25,361
Not that fucking hump Jilly "Four-eyes."
Jilly, you know, from Queens.

43
00:05:25,496 --> 00:05:28,488
- You think he's a wise guy?
- No, he's a connected guy.

44
00:05:29,233 --> 00:05:33,397
Connected? If I had a thing to lay off,
he could lay it off for me?

45
00:05:34,038 --> 00:05:36,506
- You got something you gotta lay off?
- Ain't the question.

46
00:05:36,607 --> 00:05:38,632
- You got something you gotta lay off?
- Ain't the question.

47
00:05:38,743 --> 00:05:41,803
I'm just saying if I had a thing,
he could lay it off. That's all.

48
00:05:41,912 --> 00:05:46,542
All that fucking money you owe downtown,
you'd have to lay off a fucking Brink's truck.

49
00:05:47,985 --> 00:05:51,338
- Sonny's in love.
- I think fucking Lefty's in love.

50
00:05:51,908 --> 00:05:53,102
I'll see you.

51
00:06:28,511 --> 00:06:29,842
Were you asleep?

52
00:06:31,914 --> 00:06:36,214
- Are you okay, honey?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

53
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,754
Go back to sleep. I'll call you tomorrow.

54
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,855
That's good, babe.

55
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:48,218
Okay. I'm sorry. I gotta go back to sleep.
I'm so tired.

56
00:06:48,329 --> 00:06:49,887
- All right.
- All right.

57
00:06:50,498 --> 00:06:51,897
- Hey.
- Yeah.

58
00:06:53,168 --> 00:06:54,157
What?

59
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:58,231
Put the phone on your pillow.

60
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,467
I want to listen to you breathe.

61
00:07:23,297 --> 00:07:25,128
You Don the Jeweler?

62
00:07:28,235 --> 00:07:31,713
There. That's some beautiful thing.

63
00:07:39,032 --> 00:07:41,159
Why don't you give it to your wife?

64
00:07:41,801 --> 00:07:43,701
My wife? How am I gonna give it to my wife?

65
00:07:43,803 --> 00:07:45,930
- I ain't married.
- Got a girlfriend?

66
00:07:46,206 --> 00:07:49,403
- Yeah, I got a girlfriend.
- So marry her.

67
00:07:51,277 --> 00:07:52,744
Hey, you for real?

68
00:07:53,613 --> 00:07:56,741
I'm asking you
to middle a diamond for me here.

69
00:07:57,417 --> 00:08:01,148
- All I want from my end is $8,000.
- And I'm saying to you

70
00:08:01,955 --> 00:08:05,549
is you should give it to somebody that
don't know better, because that's a fugazy.

71
00:08:05,657 --> 00:08:06,988
All right?

72
00:08:08,527 --> 00:08:11,189
That's a fugazy?
How do you know it's a fugazy?

73
00:08:11,296 --> 00:08:14,424
- You looked at it for two seconds.
- What? It's a fake.

74
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,565
I know what a fugazy is.

75
00:08:18,537 --> 00:08:21,228
Hey, pal, you want to see something?

76
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:25,669
I'm gonna show you something.

77
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:29,973
There you go. Ain't that something?
That's a beautiful thing.

78
00:08:30,444 --> 00:08:32,935
Yeah, that is a beautiful thing,
but it's not my thing.

79
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:34,377
What about this?

80
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:37,545
What do you want me to say?
Go ahead, try and sell it,

81
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:39,846
you want to be a dumbsky. Give it a shot.

82
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:42,979
Dumbsky? You calling me a dumbsky?

83
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,013
You know who you're talking to, my friend?

84
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,285
Hey, Left. Come on, have a spritzer.

85
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,928
You want to go embarrass yourself
with this thing...

86
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:53,965
Embarrass myself? My family, my children...

87
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:57,160
My mother can hold her head up
in any neighborhood in this city

88
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,897
when she walks down the block, see?

89
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:02,304
In all the five boroughs, I'm known.
Forget about it.

90
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:05,408
I'm known all over the fucking world.

91
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:12,001
Anybody, ask anybody about Lefty
from Mulberry Street.

92
00:09:13,372 --> 00:09:17,035
- You're pissing up the wrong fucking tree.
- I didn't mean no disrespect.

93
00:09:17,142 --> 00:09:20,373
- It's a misunderstanding.
- Where you going? Sit down there.

94
00:09:23,415 --> 00:09:25,383
You're gonna walk out on me?

95
00:09:26,652 --> 00:09:29,849
You don't walk out on me.
I walk out on you.

96
00:09:30,955 --> 00:09:32,582
- You got a car?
- I got a car.

97
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:35,090
Let's go get your car. Come on.

98
00:09:38,729 --> 00:09:39,889
Take care.

99
00:09:53,144 --> 00:09:55,078
Put that window up.
I'm gonna catch a draft.

100
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:57,409
I'm getting fucking cancer over here.

101
00:09:57,915 --> 00:10:00,713
- You'll be all right.
- Where we going?

102
00:10:00,818 --> 00:10:03,719
You a cop?
Don't ask so many fucking questions.

103
00:10:04,155 --> 00:10:08,387
Well, well, I've got to school you, my friend.
I've got to school you.

104
00:10:10,161 --> 00:10:12,686
What's the matter? You work for Jilly,
he never school you?

105
00:10:12,797 --> 00:10:14,127
School me in what?

106
00:10:15,565 --> 00:10:18,830
You don't talk until I talk to you.

107
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:23,506
Fugazy.

108
00:10:24,975 --> 00:10:28,240
You call that ring a fugazy. You don't know
word fucking one, my friend.

109
00:10:28,345 --> 00:10:30,575
I know. I look at you and I know.

110
00:10:31,147 --> 00:10:33,843
You a guy
can't keep his fucking mouth shut.

111
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:37,482
Hey, I'm talking to you now.

112
00:10:38,521 --> 00:10:39,749
Look, I've been in jewels five years.

113
00:10:39,856 --> 00:10:41,949
How do you figure
I'm gonna earn the kind of money I do

114
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,855
if I can't tell a fucking zircon?

115
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,951
- There's good money in it?
- What?

116
00:10:46,363 --> 00:10:47,523
What?

117
00:10:48,465 --> 00:10:50,749
- What, jewels?
- Thank you.

118
00:10:51,754 --> 00:10:54,382
Yeah. If you know what you're doing,
there is.

119
00:10:56,325 --> 00:11:00,385
Let's go to 23rd and 8th. Then we'll find out
if you know what you're doing.

120
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,434
You owe me $8,000.

121
00:11:09,404 --> 00:11:12,669
No, hold on. Wait. I gave you the diamond.

122
00:11:13,441 --> 00:11:14,965
Left, who's this guy?

123
00:11:15,076 --> 00:11:17,670
- He says it's a fugazy.
- What's a fugazy?

124
00:11:18,013 --> 00:11:21,881
- Your diamond's a fugazy.
- What is a fugazy?

125
00:11:22,317 --> 00:11:24,808
- Come on, you know.
- Don't you tell me what I know.

126
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:28,252
- You know what you did, pal.
- One of you has got to be wrong.

127
00:11:28,923 --> 00:11:31,118
That's a Tiffany fucking diamond.

128
00:11:31,826 --> 00:11:33,987
Left, that is my wife's fucking diamond ring.

129
00:11:34,095 --> 00:11:35,255
It's a fugazy, Left.

130
00:11:35,363 --> 00:11:37,456
You took away your wife's ring?

131
00:11:37,565 --> 00:11:40,089
Look, you bring that ring to any kike
on 47th Street,

132
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,963
he's gonna tell you that that is primo.

133
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:46,233
You took away your wife's ring
to go bet on the Giants?

134
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:50,742
Hey, look, you don't want it.
Give it back to me, okay?

135
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:53,210
- Hey, Left, come on...
- $8,000.

136
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:57,908
Let me talk to this fucking guy for a second.
Just give me half a second, would you?

137
00:11:58,018 --> 00:11:59,417
$8,000.

138
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,420
Why don't you go to the bar
and have a drink?

139
00:12:01,522 --> 00:12:04,047
Let me talk to the guy for a minute.
Come on.

140
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:10,657
Hey, I got a fucking black belt, pal. So you...

141
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:12,888
Shit!

142
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:20,601
This guy is going to fucking kill you.
You understand what I'm saying?

143
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:22,834
We got about two minutes
to figure a way out of this thing.

144
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:25,843
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry? Shut the fuck up.

145
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:28,470
- Sorry ain't gonna do it.
- I don't want to die.

146
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,980
Yeah?

147
00:12:30,077 --> 00:12:32,264
- What kind of car do you drive?
- A Porsche.

148
00:12:32,371 --> 00:12:33,804
Give me the keys.

149
00:12:35,107 --> 00:12:36,301
All right.

150
00:12:39,878 --> 00:12:41,971
- Whose car is it now?
- It's Lefty's.

151
00:12:42,081 --> 00:12:44,049
Lefty's stuff. All right, good.

152
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,650
That's for the fucking drinks, pal.

153
00:13:00,866 --> 00:13:04,597
Why'd you pay for that drink, Don?
A wise guy never pays for a drink.

154
00:13:05,137 --> 00:13:08,037
- I didn't know that.
- Always on the arm.

155
00:13:08,206 --> 00:13:09,264
All right.

156
00:13:10,441 --> 00:13:12,341
You scared that guy, though.

157
00:13:14,712 --> 00:13:16,043
That cracks me up.

158
00:13:17,515 --> 00:13:21,576
I got 26 fucking hits under my belt,
and you're the one he's scared of. Fuck.

159
00:13:21,686 --> 00:13:23,017
- Pull over.
- What?

160
00:13:23,221 --> 00:13:24,483
Pull over. I've got to do something.

161
00:13:24,589 --> 00:13:25,988
- Right here?
- Yeah. Right here, pull over.

162
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:27,580
All right. I'm cool.

163
00:13:29,594 --> 00:13:32,119
Come on, give me a hand with this.
Pull this out, pull it.

164
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:36,428
- You're taking the whole fucking thing apart.
- You didn't hear nothing under the dash?

165
00:13:36,534 --> 00:13:39,560
- No, I didn't hear a fucking thing.
- There it is.

166
00:13:41,506 --> 00:13:42,996
I can go right up the back.

167
00:13:43,107 --> 00:13:44,631
What the fuck are you doing down there?

168
00:13:44,742 --> 00:13:48,143
- Just feeling around here.
- You think I got a wire in my car?

169
00:13:48,246 --> 00:13:50,304
- Fuck!
- You think I'm fucking stupid?

170
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:52,608
Did I say that? Did I say you got a wire?

171
00:13:52,716 --> 00:13:54,684
Say it to my face, if you're gonna do this.

172
00:13:54,784 --> 00:13:57,412
Nothing for nothing,
but I think you owe me an apology.

173
00:13:57,521 --> 00:14:00,615
Ain't the question. I lost a screwdriver here.

174
00:14:01,158 --> 00:14:03,388
- You lost a what?
- The screwdriver fell down there.

175
00:14:03,493 --> 00:14:06,121
Come on. You lost a screwdriver
in my fucking stereo?

176
00:14:06,229 --> 00:14:08,163
You'll find it again. It's down there.

177
00:14:10,061 --> 00:14:12,782
- So you like the DeVille?
- Forget about it.

178
00:14:13,422 --> 00:14:15,720
Yeah. I got the Fleetwood Brougham.

179
00:14:15,825 --> 00:14:18,658
- Is that right? With the velour?
- Forget about it.

180
00:14:21,063 --> 00:14:23,258
- Are you married?
- No.

181
00:14:24,066 --> 00:14:26,933
- I got a girl out there in California.
- That's good.

182
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,870
She should stay in California.

183
00:14:30,673 --> 00:14:32,732
Keep your eye out for your balls.

184
00:14:33,075 --> 00:14:35,634
- Yeah, you're right.
- I'm always right.

185
00:14:36,278 --> 00:14:39,543
A wise guy's always right.
Even when he's wrong, he's right.

186
00:14:40,482 --> 00:14:44,646
All the way up the line, connected guy
to wise guy to skipper to boss.

187
00:14:45,487 --> 00:14:47,318
- Yeah, I know that.
- You know?

188
00:14:47,422 --> 00:14:49,253
- Yeah.
- What do you know?

189
00:14:49,357 --> 00:14:52,326
It's kind of like the army,
like a chain of command.

190
00:14:52,427 --> 00:14:56,420
The army? It ain't nothing like the army.

191
00:14:57,332 --> 00:14:59,197
The army is some guy you don't know

192
00:14:59,301 --> 00:15:02,759
sends you out to whack
some other guy you don't know. Army.

193
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:10,701
- You want to check in with me tomorrow?
- Yeah, all right.

194
00:15:14,082 --> 00:15:18,017
I don't know how the fuck you knew
that ring was a fugazy.

195
00:15:21,055 --> 00:15:23,387
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah, so long.

196
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:04,611
Don the Jeweler is a good earner.
He ain't a leech.

197
00:16:05,317 --> 00:16:08,684
He keeps to himself. He's a jewel guy.

198
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:12,721
- Where's he from, Jilly?
- Florida.

199
00:16:12,825 --> 00:16:14,315
- Florida.
- He's a jewel guy.

200
00:16:14,426 --> 00:16:18,556
- But Florida where? The beach?
- No, not the beach.

201
00:16:22,001 --> 00:16:23,195
I don't know.

202
00:16:23,302 --> 00:16:25,497
Wherever the fuck
the Dodgers have spring training.

203
00:16:25,604 --> 00:16:26,628
He's a stand-up guy?

204
00:16:26,739 --> 00:16:29,674
I said I knew him, Left.
I didn't say I fucked him.

205
00:16:33,379 --> 00:16:35,506
Hey, you. Come here!

206
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,774
Come here.

207
00:16:41,053 --> 00:16:43,179
What do you say, Jilly? How you doing?

208
00:16:43,288 --> 00:16:47,748
My friend Lefty's asking about you.
Don't embarrass me, capisce?

209
00:16:47,859 --> 00:16:49,850
I wouldn't do that to you.
You know that, Jilly.

210
00:16:49,961 --> 00:16:52,623
Because if you do,
one of us is gonna whack you out.

211
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:54,197
That's not good.

212
00:16:54,299 --> 00:16:56,597
All right, Jilly. Go back to your bath.

213
00:16:57,835 --> 00:16:59,894
- Take care, kid.
- Good to see you.

214
00:17:06,444 --> 00:17:09,072
When I introduce you, I'm gonna say,

215
00:17:09,747 --> 00:17:13,114
"This is a friend of mine."
That means you're a connected guy.

216
00:17:13,551 --> 00:17:18,045
If I said instead, "This is a friend of ours,"
that would mean you're a made guy.

217
00:17:18,156 --> 00:17:19,248
Capisce?

218
00:17:19,357 --> 00:17:21,825
Yeah, "friend of mine." "Friend of ours."

219
00:17:21,926 --> 00:17:25,157
- What do I call you? "Friend of ours," or...
- You keep your mouth shut about me.

220
00:17:25,263 --> 00:17:27,389
Know what I'm saying? Hey, Don.

221
00:17:28,665 --> 00:17:30,448
You got a couple of fazools?

222
00:17:30,787 --> 00:17:33,415
- I got some things I got to take care of.
- Yeah.

223
00:17:33,523 --> 00:17:35,115
What do you want? $100?

224
00:17:36,025 --> 00:17:38,050
What are you doing?

225
00:17:38,161 --> 00:17:40,527
A wise guy don't carry his money
in a wallet.

226
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:43,690
A wise guy carries money in a roll.
Like this. See?

227
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,598
Beaner on the outside. Like that. Come on.

228
00:17:48,771 --> 00:17:50,068
That mustache.

229
00:17:50,773 --> 00:17:54,402
You got to get rid of that mustache,
'cause that's against the rules.

230
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:57,638
And get a pair of pants, will you?
This ain't a fucking rodeo.

231
00:17:57,747 --> 00:18:01,114
Dress like I dress. This is my family.

232
00:18:02,251 --> 00:18:05,118
- More even than my own family.
- Is that right?

233
00:18:06,489 --> 00:18:09,720
- I don't got a family.
- You don't got a family?

234
00:18:09,825 --> 00:18:12,350
No, I'm an orphan.
I grew up in an orphanage.

235
00:18:12,794 --> 00:18:15,422
Ain't the question, even if you had a family.

236
00:18:16,765 --> 00:18:19,529
If this is your family,
then this is your family.

237
00:18:19,668 --> 00:18:21,659
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah.

238
00:18:22,237 --> 00:18:23,932
I'm freezing my balls off.

239
00:18:25,073 --> 00:18:28,167
What do we got to be standing outside
all day in the cold for?

240
00:18:28,276 --> 00:18:31,302
- Got to show the flag.
- The flag of fucking Antarctica.

241
00:18:31,613 --> 00:18:33,171
- What's going on?
- Hey, Lefty.

242
00:18:33,281 --> 00:18:36,114
- Lefty, what do you say?
- This is Donnie, a friend of mine.

243
00:18:36,218 --> 00:18:37,378
How you doing?

244
00:18:37,486 --> 00:18:39,954
The good news is
my dick is now a popsicle.

245
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,327
- Hi, Sonny.
- Hey, Sonny, how you doing?

246
00:18:48,563 --> 00:18:49,791
Sonny Red.

247
00:18:52,067 --> 00:18:54,899
- Who's this guy?
- This is Donnie, a friend of mine.

248
00:18:57,238 --> 00:18:59,729
Just stand there and look dangerous, friend.

249
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,865
He does look dangerous, don't he?

250
00:19:01,976 --> 00:19:04,570
You gonna make this week's vig? I hope so.

251
00:19:05,112 --> 00:19:08,639
'Cause I don't want to have to come
looking for you. You hear me?

252
00:19:12,072 --> 00:19:15,838
- Come on, Bruno.
- I just shit in my pants, right?

253
00:19:17,144 --> 00:19:19,078
It's the boss, Donnie.

254
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,981
Okay, Joe,
the Bureau wants your autograph.

255
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:00,415
- What's that, you want me to sign it?
- Forget about it.

256
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:01,781
"Forget about it" is right.

257
00:20:01,887 --> 00:20:06,119
Listen, by the way, they want you to shave
the mustache. Regulations.

258
00:20:06,225 --> 00:20:08,659
How did they even know
about the mustache?

259
00:20:09,829 --> 00:20:12,593
- Did you rat me out?
- I didn't rat you out.

260
00:20:14,099 --> 00:20:17,796
- Show and tell.
- Yeah. Nice.

261
00:20:19,705 --> 00:20:22,571
- What?
- So does he. He wants me to shave.

262
00:20:22,674 --> 00:20:24,403
- Who? Ruggiero?
- Yeah.

263
00:20:26,611 --> 00:20:28,670
Regulations. Here.

264
00:20:31,049 --> 00:20:32,710
You know something?

265
00:20:32,817 --> 00:20:35,786
I got him. I got my hooks in the guy.

266
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,352
Cloaked by the high grasses
of the African Savannah,

267
00:20:45,663 --> 00:20:48,894
the stalking cheetah moves stealthily
towards his prey.

268
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:58,756
- How you doing?
- You're here for my dad?

269
00:20:58,863 --> 00:21:01,195
Yeah. I'm Donnie.

270
00:21:01,298 --> 00:21:03,027
- Tommy. How are you?
- Good.

271
00:21:03,132 --> 00:21:05,396
- Merry Christmas. Come on in.
- Thanks.

272
00:21:05,502 --> 00:21:08,835
- Benny's watching TV. You met Tommy?
- Yes, we met. Thank you.

273
00:21:08,972 --> 00:21:11,770
Separated from the herd,
the gazelle senses danger.

274
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:13,433
Benny, Donnie's here.

275
00:21:13,977 --> 00:21:15,911
Too late. The cheetah springs.

276
00:21:17,113 --> 00:21:18,580
Benny loves animals.

277
00:21:21,651 --> 00:21:24,745
- You see that?
- I'll be in the kitchen if you need me.

278
00:21:26,523 --> 00:21:28,252
- Hunter and hunted.
- Look at that.

279
00:21:28,358 --> 00:21:31,919
Predator and prey.
The endless cycle of nature repeated.

280
00:21:32,028 --> 00:21:34,963
I brought this by for you.
It's a little Christmas present.

281
00:21:35,064 --> 00:21:37,055
Yeah, wait a minute. Here.

282
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:48,241
I'm sorry, Left, but I'm in
a little bit of a rush here, you know? So...

283
00:21:49,444 --> 00:21:50,968
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.

284
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:52,910
That's really nice of you.

285
00:21:55,217 --> 00:21:57,811
Wow. Look at this.

286
00:21:59,154 --> 00:22:03,056
Very generous of you, Donnie.
Thank you. Good boy.

287
00:22:03,158 --> 00:22:05,922
- All right. So, happy holidays.
- Where you going?

288
00:22:06,461 --> 00:22:09,396
- I thought you was an orphan.
- Yeah.

289
00:22:09,965 --> 00:22:12,331
- So what are you gonna do?
- Left, I don't want to spoil your day.

290
00:22:12,434 --> 00:22:13,628
Come on.

291
00:22:14,336 --> 00:22:17,362
No man of mine is gonna be alone
on Christmas. Come on in here.

292
00:22:17,472 --> 00:22:18,439
Come on.

293
00:22:18,941 --> 00:22:21,637
You think I cook
like them goombahs in Brooklyn?

294
00:22:21,843 --> 00:22:25,609
All they know is manicotti.
A hundred years, they'll be eating manicotti.

295
00:22:25,714 --> 00:22:27,909
- You never ate coq au vin?
- No.

296
00:22:29,585 --> 00:22:30,969
There we are.

297
00:22:31,071 --> 00:22:34,063
Can of collagen, can of tomatoes.

298
00:22:36,209 --> 00:22:38,575
- Punch of salt.
- "Punch"?

299
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:42,546
- Punch. Punch of salt?
- "Punch" or "pinch"?

300
00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:44,617
"Punch," not "pinch."

301
00:22:44,718 --> 00:22:47,414
- Did I say "pinch"?
- No, you said "punch."

302
00:22:47,888 --> 00:22:50,686
Sometimes you don't make
no fucking sense, Donnie.

303
00:22:52,292 --> 00:22:55,887
- You got all this, Annette?
- I can't cook special like Benny.

304
00:22:55,996 --> 00:22:58,089
Shut up, Annette. Forget about it.

305
00:22:59,366 --> 00:23:01,698
Wherever you go, the best cooks are men.

306
00:23:01,802 --> 00:23:04,896
On Mars, the best cooks are gonna be men.
That's a fact.

307
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:09,101
Wait till you taste this coq au vin.

308
00:23:09,409 --> 00:23:12,378
It's gonna melt in your mouth,
like Holy Communion.

309
00:23:13,512 --> 00:23:16,174
What the fuck is that? Annette, get that.

310
00:23:21,821 --> 00:23:23,186
- Thank you.
- Sure.

311
00:23:23,289 --> 00:23:25,189
- Thanks, Annette.
- Sure, Benny.

312
00:23:25,291 --> 00:23:27,088
She's a good woman, Annette.

313
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,821
One broad, that's enough for anyone.

314
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:33,492
Pop, I'm going out
for a couple of hours, okay?

315
00:23:36,602 --> 00:23:39,196
Merry Christmas. Donnie, take care.

316
00:23:39,305 --> 00:23:41,136
Yeah, you, too. Take it easy.

317
00:23:45,578 --> 00:23:48,376
My own fucking son's a junkie.
Can you believe it?

318
00:23:48,881 --> 00:23:50,439
What are you gonna do?

319
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:52,645
Give him a smack in the mouth
once in a while.

320
00:23:52,752 --> 00:23:54,481
I got bruises on my hands.

321
00:23:57,355 --> 00:23:59,789
You don't know the worries I got, Donnie.

322
00:23:59,991 --> 00:24:04,018
A woman like Annette, I can't do right
by her. I ain't got $3 in my pocket.

323
00:24:04,195 --> 00:24:07,392
I put a bet on a horse, that horse don't do
what it's supposed to do,

324
00:24:07,499 --> 00:24:11,182
like every fucking thing else in my life.
I got cancer of the prick.

325
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:14,390
My ex-wife lives in this building.

326
00:24:14,492 --> 00:24:17,017
Can you believe it?
I run into her in the elevator.

327
00:24:17,128 --> 00:24:20,154
I got to have three spritzers afterward
just to calm down after I see her.

328
00:24:20,264 --> 00:24:22,960
What are you talking about,
cancer of the prick?

329
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,098
It's cancer of the prick.
You didn't know that?

330
00:24:27,505 --> 00:24:29,598
I'm in the medical books for that.

331
00:24:30,841 --> 00:24:34,777
I got this boat, too, this Bertram.
50-foot Bertram with twin Chryslers.

332
00:24:34,879 --> 00:24:37,313
I had to get rid of it
for money I owe Sonny Red.

333
00:24:37,415 --> 00:24:39,610
The vig alone is $3,000 a week.

334
00:24:39,716 --> 00:24:42,913
- Who's that guy with him?
- Bruno? That's his son.

335
00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:47,046
- I'd like to put a dent in that guy's head.
- No, you don't do that, Donnie.

336
00:24:47,223 --> 00:24:50,556
- You don't touch him.
- I know. I'm saying I wish I could.

337
00:24:50,894 --> 00:24:52,191
You wish?

338
00:24:52,896 --> 00:24:55,262
A guy like you doesn't touch a made guy.

339
00:24:58,068 --> 00:24:59,968
You know what I did yesterday?

340
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,061
I went in front of all the skippers.
That cocksucker Sonny Red, all of them.

341
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:10,836
I went on the record with you.
You know what that means?

342
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:12,902
I think I do.

343
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:15,775
You do? You ain't got no fucking idea,
my friend.

344
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:20,082
Nobody can touch you now. I'm your man.

345
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:24,049
Jesus Christ couldn't touch you,
because I represent you.

346
00:25:24,354 --> 00:25:28,017
So keep your nose clean, be a good earner,

347
00:25:29,059 --> 00:25:31,050
follow the rules, and who knows,

348
00:25:31,161 --> 00:25:34,858
maybe one day when they open the books,
you get straightened out.

349
00:25:36,467 --> 00:25:38,196
Become a wise guy.

350
00:25:38,902 --> 00:25:42,497
A made guy. Come on, lift your glass.

351
00:25:45,676 --> 00:25:50,068
I'd die with you, Donnie.
Anything happens, I'm responsible.

352
00:25:51,367 --> 00:25:52,391
- All right?
- All right.

353
00:25:52,502 --> 00:25:53,594
- Salute.
- Salute.

354
00:25:54,671 --> 00:25:55,695
All right, Don.

355
00:25:55,805 --> 00:25:59,502
- Thanks a lot. It was excellent.
- Could you spot me a couple hundred?

356
00:25:59,609 --> 00:26:03,306
- Yeah, okay.
- I'll get it back to you. You got it here.

357
00:26:03,713 --> 00:26:05,044
Here you go.

358
00:26:07,382 --> 00:26:08,542
- I'll get back to you on this.
- Yeah.

359
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,278
- Believe me. Call me tomorrow.
- All right.

360
00:26:43,552 --> 00:26:44,780
Hello.

361
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,635
- Look what the reindeer dragged in.
- Merry Christmas.

362
00:27:06,874 --> 00:27:09,342
I was working. Nothing I could do.

363
00:27:10,778 --> 00:27:12,040
Working?

364
00:27:12,446 --> 00:27:14,607
- Who works Christmas Day, Joe?
- I do.

365
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:19,448
- Where's the kids?
- They couldn't wait anymore.

366
00:27:21,455 --> 00:27:22,888
Well, that's nice.

367
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:25,590
Christmas, they can't wait up
for their father.

368
00:27:25,693 --> 00:27:29,060
- Is that your way of saying you're sorry?
- You know I'm sorry.

369
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:31,783
I don't need to know.
The girls need to know.

370
00:27:31,885 --> 00:27:34,011
Only be sure to introduce yourself.

371
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,015
They might think
you're the Fuller brush man.

372
00:27:36,122 --> 00:27:39,990
- If you knew what I was doing today...
- I don't have an idea

373
00:27:41,294 --> 00:27:45,355
- because you don't tell me, remember?
- Because it's for your own protection.

374
00:27:48,568 --> 00:27:50,365
As if any of this is for me.

375
00:27:53,206 --> 00:27:55,265
You're getting the checks, right?

376
00:27:55,641 --> 00:27:58,542
- I'm getting the checks.
- Good. Then don't say it like it's nothing.

377
00:27:58,644 --> 00:28:01,204
- 'Cause it's not nothing.
- It's not nothing, but it's not a husband.

378
00:28:01,314 --> 00:28:03,646
A lot of women would disagree with you.

379
00:28:06,586 --> 00:28:08,918
Is that what you do with all your time?

380
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:12,182
- Conduct polls with all your women?
- I'm not even gonna dignify that.

381
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:16,317
Seven days a week, I'm out there busting
my ass, and this is the shit I come home to.

382
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:19,022
You said it was gonna be three months.
It's going on two years.

383
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:22,429
How do you find anything in here?
You got cereal on three shelves.

384
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,593
You got cereals over here.

385
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:28,138
Put stuff away for once. It's my job.

386
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,606
- Quit my job?
- What about my job, Joe?

387
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:35,644
Christmas Day you don't show up,
so Mommy puts on the Santa suit.

388
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:38,307
Mommy hangs the lights.
Mommy carves the roast.

389
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:40,475
- You just leave it alone.
- Joseph.

390
00:28:41,253 --> 00:28:43,619
- It would be easier if you tell me...
- Just give me a break.

391
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:44,984
...what goes on with these guys,
what you do.

392
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:47,422
Just shut up, please. Leave me alone.

393
00:28:57,002 --> 00:29:00,732
Terry and Kerry are at my mother's.
Why don't you go pick them up?

394
00:29:01,538 --> 00:29:02,800
Where's Sherry?

395
00:29:05,709 --> 00:29:08,269
Sherry is with her boyfriend.

396
00:29:09,146 --> 00:29:11,225
- What?
- She's at her boyfriend's.

397
00:29:12,836 --> 00:29:15,634
- Since when does she have a boyfriend?
- She's 12, Joe.

398
00:29:15,739 --> 00:29:18,299
- I didn't okay this, Maggie.
- Okay it? What do you think?

399
00:29:18,408 --> 00:29:20,876
You can drop out of the sky like God
and bark orders?

400
00:29:20,977 --> 00:29:23,207
I am the husband and the father!
I put food on that table!

401
00:29:23,313 --> 00:29:24,871
- Undercover husband!
- What do I get for Christmas?

402
00:29:24,981 --> 00:29:26,915
Empty fucking house!

403
00:29:28,685 --> 00:29:29,947
I'm here.

404
00:29:33,189 --> 00:29:34,816
I wanted to be alone with you.

405
00:29:36,927 --> 00:29:38,053
Oh, God.

406
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:03,617
What happened to your 'stache?

407
00:30:05,354 --> 00:30:07,686
The B, they made me shave it off.
Can you believe that?

408
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:09,189
- They didn't.
- Yeah.

409
00:30:10,492 --> 00:30:13,086
It was the only thing I liked about this job.

410
00:30:13,629 --> 00:30:16,655
- So, Sherry got a boyfriend?
- Yeah, she does.

411
00:30:18,434 --> 00:30:20,231
Nice kid. He's so nice.

412
00:30:22,638 --> 00:30:24,401
He's on the wrestling team.

413
00:30:26,108 --> 00:30:27,904
I'll bet he's on the wrestling team.

414
00:30:28,009 --> 00:30:30,739
Kerry's doing the catechism. So sweet.

415
00:30:32,447 --> 00:30:33,914
And they're swimming.

416
00:30:34,282 --> 00:30:36,773
Coach says he's never seen nothing like it.

417
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:42,082
There's a meet Saturday.

418
00:30:50,351 --> 00:30:52,546
What am I gonna do? We'll see.

419
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,797
You know that I wouldn't do this to you
if I didn't think you could handle it.

420
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:16,040
I'm not worried about me, Joe.

421
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:59,074
All right, what's going on, kids?

422
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:02,546
Am I getting the silent treatment?

423
00:32:07,526 --> 00:32:09,221
I'll make a bet with you.

424
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,261
I'll bet you $20

425
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:17,866
that you can't get through this entire meal
without saying three words.

426
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,464
All right?

427
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:22,136
You lose.

428
00:32:28,847 --> 00:32:30,164
What did she say?

429
00:32:33,671 --> 00:32:35,002
What did she say?

430
00:33:43,639 --> 00:33:46,972
Girls, come here a second.
Come here, Terry, Kerry.

431
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:51,441
Come on. Sorry, sweetie.
Come on. Let's go see your sister.

432
00:33:51,647 --> 00:33:53,171
Come on upstairs.

433
00:33:56,519 --> 00:33:58,817
Let's just, let's read a book.

434
00:34:20,628 --> 00:34:21,993
Do what you're told.

435
00:34:30,337 --> 00:34:32,737
Left, it's Donnie. I'm checking in.

436
00:34:37,111 --> 00:34:39,579
Yeah, that's what I said. I'm checking in.

437
00:34:40,848 --> 00:34:43,339
No. I've been out all day. What's going on?

438
00:34:53,993 --> 00:34:55,722
All right. So long.

439
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:17,110
You didn't see the paper?
How come you didn't see the paper?

440
00:35:17,217 --> 00:35:21,244
Every morning you're reading the paper.
What were you reading this morning?

441
00:35:21,921 --> 00:35:22,945
Look at this.

442
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:28,021
Can you believe this?
The boss gets whacked. The fucking boss.

443
00:35:28,795 --> 00:35:31,228
You never hear from the boss
until he gets whacked

444
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:34,424
- and then your life gets turned around.
- Want to tell me where we're going?

445
00:35:34,533 --> 00:35:37,093
- I got sent for.
- So what does that mean?

446
00:35:37,202 --> 00:35:39,534
- You got sent for.
- What does that mean?

447
00:35:40,038 --> 00:35:41,528
What do you think it means?

448
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,302
You don't wanna go? You want me
to turn around? I'll turn around.

449
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:46,877
What are you gonna do?
Take a left off the fucking bridge?

450
00:35:46,979 --> 00:35:49,573
- Not here, I'm saying after the bridge.
- No, I gotta go.

451
00:35:49,681 --> 00:35:52,636
You get sent for, you go. Sonny sent for me.

452
00:35:53,371 --> 00:35:54,702
I'm sick of this.

453
00:35:55,306 --> 00:35:58,833
- You got sent for by Sonny Red?
- Did I say Sonny Red?

454
00:35:58,943 --> 00:36:01,969
Not Sonny Red. Sonny Black.

455
00:36:02,847 --> 00:36:05,077
Donnie, what are you doing? Put the fuck...

456
00:36:05,183 --> 00:36:07,617
Donnie, you wanna kill me
with that draft?

457
00:36:10,888 --> 00:36:13,048
Left, Sonny Black is your friend.
What's the big deal?

458
00:36:13,156 --> 00:36:16,216
Right. We're friendly.
Ain't the question, "friend."

459
00:36:16,994 --> 00:36:19,963
The whole time Sonny Black's in the can,
the whole time...

460
00:36:20,063 --> 00:36:22,827
He's got a family, he's got a mistress.

461
00:36:22,933 --> 00:36:25,163
He's got a mistress for the mistress.

462
00:36:25,302 --> 00:36:28,396
I watched out for them, all of them.
Me, I was the only one.

463
00:36:28,505 --> 00:36:30,166
Nobody else gave a fuck.

464
00:36:30,807 --> 00:36:33,435
Two hundred fazools, week in, week out.

465
00:36:34,077 --> 00:36:36,671
So you took care of Sonny Black.
What are you worried about, then?

466
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:40,876
Sometimes I think, in that orphanage,
they dropped you on your fucking head.

467
00:36:40,984 --> 00:36:42,781
How am I supposed to know
if you don't explain it?

468
00:36:42,886 --> 00:36:45,013
You think I don't know
how a hit gets set up?

469
00:36:45,122 --> 00:36:46,111
You think I don't know that?

470
00:36:46,223 --> 00:36:48,088
You know, what I know.

471
00:36:48,191 --> 00:36:51,490
How many times have I been
on the other end of that fucking phone?

472
00:36:51,595 --> 00:36:53,085
- Twenty-six times.
- Great.

473
00:36:53,196 --> 00:36:55,255
You just got done saying
you and Sonny Black are friends.

474
00:36:55,365 --> 00:36:57,491
Donnie, I got sent for.

475
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:02,037
In our thing, you get sent for,
you go in alive, you come out dead

476
00:37:02,138 --> 00:37:03,867
and it's your best friend that does it.

477
00:37:21,524 --> 00:37:25,927
Anything should happen to me,
make sure Annette gets the car.

478
00:37:47,301 --> 00:37:49,360
- Spritzer, Left?
- Later, maybe.

479
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:51,995
Look at this hand. This ain't a hand.

480
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:57,509
This is a fucking deformed Creature
from the Black Lagoon's claw I got here.

481
00:37:57,611 --> 00:37:59,238
Hey, Left.

482
00:38:22,036 --> 00:38:24,299
- You throwing that down?
- I don't know.

483
00:38:26,206 --> 00:38:27,366
Gin.

484
00:38:28,742 --> 00:38:31,711
Love on the rocks ain't no surprise

485
00:38:34,214 --> 00:38:37,411
- Paulie, that ain't gin.
- Ain't no fucking surprise, neither.

486
00:38:37,517 --> 00:38:38,541
It's gin.

487
00:38:38,651 --> 00:38:40,118
What are you talking? You got two sevens.

488
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,585
I had three sevens.

489
00:38:41,688 --> 00:38:44,179
- Paulie.
- Nicky, I had three sevens.

490
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:46,622
I know I had three sevens.
Don't start this shit now.

491
00:38:46,726 --> 00:38:49,217
You know you had three sevens?
You don't have three sevens.

492
00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:50,557
I had three sevens.

493
00:38:50,663 --> 00:38:54,565
From now on, I'll deal out the cards,
you say "gin" whenever you feel like it.

494
00:38:54,667 --> 00:38:58,433
Fucking booths. $200 in action
and what we have we got, five?

495
00:38:58,538 --> 00:39:00,938
We're taking a beating again
this week, Sonny.

496
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,975
Let's go for a ride. I got a new car.

497
00:39:11,069 --> 00:39:13,299
Can you believe the ride on this car?

498
00:39:13,638 --> 00:39:16,573
I can't understand how they lost a war,
them Germans.

499
00:39:16,674 --> 00:39:18,938
- I got a date out in Jersey tonight.
- Which broad is this?

500
00:39:19,043 --> 00:39:22,570
The one from the calendar.
Miss Pennzoil Air Filter of 1978.

501
00:39:23,148 --> 00:39:27,209
- What's he doing looking in the mirror?
- What're you doing over there, Left?

502
00:39:27,318 --> 00:39:29,218
What's it look like I'm doing?

503
00:39:29,888 --> 00:39:31,583
I'm checking my lipstick.

504
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:35,023
What would I do without you, Left?
What would I do?

505
00:39:35,527 --> 00:39:38,587
What about you, Donnie?
What would you do?

506
00:39:38,963 --> 00:39:41,955
Have to find yourself a new goombah,
wouldn't you?

507
00:39:43,501 --> 00:39:45,799
That was something about the boss, huh?

508
00:39:45,904 --> 00:39:47,838
We all gotta go sometime.

509
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:59,044
What are we doing here, Sonny?
We glomming something, or what?

510
00:39:59,149 --> 00:40:01,049
- No.
- You, wait in the car.

511
00:40:01,151 --> 00:40:03,085
- What?
- Watch the car.

512
00:40:26,977 --> 00:40:28,171
Oh, fuck!

513
00:40:28,645 --> 00:40:29,771
Shit!

514
00:40:31,515 --> 00:40:34,347
Christ, I think I shit my pants. What is this?

515
00:40:35,651 --> 00:40:38,484
He's supposed to go
to an animal trainer somewhere.

516
00:40:38,855 --> 00:40:41,085
- Fuck him.
- Left, I think he likes you.

517
00:40:41,657 --> 00:40:44,922
- Either that or he's just hungry.
- What's he got to do with me?

518
00:40:45,027 --> 00:40:47,689
- Sonny, what is this?
- It's for you.

519
00:40:47,797 --> 00:40:49,025
For me?

520
00:40:49,532 --> 00:40:51,679
I know how you feel about animals.

521
00:40:51,787 --> 00:40:53,584
It's a gift from me.

522
00:40:54,056 --> 00:40:55,921
- It's for me?
- Yeah.

523
00:40:57,926 --> 00:41:00,360
I got the power. Now you're under me.

524
00:41:00,929 --> 00:41:04,763
- What do you mean, you got the power?
- Sonny got upped.

525
00:41:05,934 --> 00:41:07,799
What, you got upped?

526
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:11,571
Rusty's gonna run the whole thing
from the can.

527
00:41:11,707 --> 00:41:14,505
Sonny Red's got Little Italy. I got Brooklyn.

528
00:41:15,577 --> 00:41:17,339
That's why you sent for me?

529
00:41:19,947 --> 00:41:23,144
Yeah, why? What did you think,
you was gonna get whacked?

530
00:41:23,618 --> 00:41:26,086
Lefty thought he was gonna get whacked.

531
00:41:28,055 --> 00:41:30,046
Congratulations. Come here.

532
00:41:33,427 --> 00:41:34,826
Good stuff.

533
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:42,525
Grab the pussy. Let's go.

534
00:41:43,132 --> 00:41:44,997
What am I gonna do with this?

535
00:41:50,373 --> 00:41:52,466
He thinks they smell fear.

536
00:42:20,535 --> 00:42:21,866
I'm sick of this.

537
00:42:23,305 --> 00:42:25,535
You and Sonny Black are friends.

538
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,665
I got told to shut my mouth
about Sonny Black.

539
00:42:27,776 --> 00:42:32,392
How many times I stood up
to the boss himself, that cocksucker.

540
00:42:33,167 --> 00:42:34,657
May he rest in peace.

541
00:42:42,343 --> 00:42:45,277
You're gonna have to...
You're gonna have to...

542
00:42:46,012 --> 00:42:46,979
I got...

543
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:49,441
I'm gonna need 40 of those burgers.

544
00:42:50,684 --> 00:42:51,912
Hold the onions.

545
00:42:55,288 --> 00:42:58,382
Sonny Black, they make skipper.
I ain't a mutt.

546
00:42:59,392 --> 00:43:01,860
Thirty years busting my hump. For what?

547
00:43:02,529 --> 00:43:03,518
A lion.

548
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:06,497
Five hours ago, you thought
you was gonna get whacked.

549
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:10,696
- Donnie, did I say I was gonna get whacked?
- Not in so many words.

550
00:43:11,204 --> 00:43:14,264
I don't understand you.
How many words does it take?

551
00:43:16,209 --> 00:43:18,109
You're right. I misunderstood.

552
00:43:18,612 --> 00:43:22,480
Thirty years I'm earning.
Any work to be done, call Lefty.

553
00:43:23,083 --> 00:43:26,643
I never complained.
Twenty-six guys I clipped.

554
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:31,183
Do I get upped? No, they pass me by.

555
00:43:32,224 --> 00:43:36,092
Sonny Black gets upped.
I don't get fucking upped.

556
00:43:36,395 --> 00:43:38,795
Sonny was probably in
on whacking the boss.

557
00:43:38,897 --> 00:43:41,525
Of course he was in on whacking the boss.

558
00:43:43,535 --> 00:43:47,130
Whacking the boss.
Another thing I get left out of.

559
00:43:48,173 --> 00:43:52,007
It's like one of those, whatchamacallit,
you know, bureaucracy.

560
00:43:53,045 --> 00:43:56,310
What bureaucracy? Ain't no bureaucracy.
What you talking about, bureaucracy?

561
00:43:56,415 --> 00:43:58,883
Where the fuck do you get your ideas?
Bureaucracy.

562
00:43:58,984 --> 00:44:02,283
All I'm saying, I'm saying they
don't appreciate you, is what I'm saying.

563
00:44:02,388 --> 00:44:04,515
Appreciate? They appreciate you?

564
00:44:05,824 --> 00:44:08,156
- Come on, Left, I'm on your side.
- You're on my side?

565
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:09,978
You're on my side
because I say you're on my side.

566
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,206
Hey, look. Donnie!

567
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:13,840
Don't get
on your fucking high horse, Donnie.

568
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:16,149
I don't like that.

569
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:29,264
But tell you what.

570
00:44:30,567 --> 00:44:31,795
Look at that.

571
00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:35,461
I wish I had that boat again, that Bertram.

572
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:39,734
I wish I had that boat.

573
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:43,944
I'd get in my car with Annette,
I'd drive down to the pier

574
00:44:44,048 --> 00:44:46,141
I'd get on that boat and I'd go.

575
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:47,239
I'd go.

576
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:50,809
East, west, north, south,
nobody'd ever find me.

577
00:44:53,322 --> 00:44:55,790
Look at this thing. It's a fucking insult.

578
00:45:25,455 --> 00:45:28,049
Let's go! Come on.

579
00:47:19,118 --> 00:47:21,177
I gave it to him!

580
00:47:23,689 --> 00:47:25,418
- Come on, Sonny!
- Jesus!

581
00:47:25,524 --> 00:47:28,049
- No, Sonny! Please.
- He's got the money.

582
00:47:57,341 --> 00:48:00,367
- He was a friend of mine.
- Broad daylight. I can't believe it.

583
00:48:00,477 --> 00:48:04,243
What kind of people are gonna take
another man's property right off the street?

584
00:48:04,348 --> 00:48:06,009
Forget about it.

585
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:08,811
The whole society's going down the tubes.

586
00:48:08,919 --> 00:48:11,183
We never had this kind of a problem
when Nixon was around.

587
00:48:11,288 --> 00:48:14,815
Nixon? Nixon? Forget about Nixon. Nixon.

588
00:48:14,925 --> 00:48:17,553
We had respect all over the world.

589
00:48:17,661 --> 00:48:18,992
We stood for something.

590
00:48:19,096 --> 00:48:21,087
We had law and order in the street.

591
00:48:21,198 --> 00:48:23,428
We had a little different story.

592
00:48:23,534 --> 00:48:25,001
Too bad he wasn't Sicilian.

593
00:48:25,636 --> 00:48:26,762
He was Sicilian.

594
00:48:26,871 --> 00:48:29,896
You know, last night
I'm watching Roger Grimsby on the news

595
00:48:30,006 --> 00:48:32,600
and those Ayatollah cockamamie people
are marching through the streets,

596
00:48:32,709 --> 00:48:34,574
and they're whipping each other on the back
with whips.

597
00:48:34,677 --> 00:48:36,076
Get out of here. I never heard of that.

598
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:37,407
- Donnie, am I right?
- What?

599
00:48:37,614 --> 00:48:38,603
Fucking fanatics over there.

600
00:48:38,715 --> 00:48:41,707
What're you asking him for?
What're you asking him for?

601
00:48:41,818 --> 00:48:44,116
What was it, a ventriloquist act?
I asked him a question...

602
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:45,812
But you're talking to me. You're asking him.

603
00:48:45,922 --> 00:48:47,947
He reads... What do you mean,
why am I asking him?

604
00:48:48,057 --> 00:48:49,854
Fuck if he reads. You ask me.
What're you asking him?

605
00:48:49,959 --> 00:48:52,723
- Did you see it?
- I'm here. You're talking to me.

606
00:48:53,563 --> 00:48:55,394
You're talking to me.
What are you talking to him for?

607
00:48:55,498 --> 00:48:58,262
I talk to you, then I talk to him.
I talk to everybody.

608
00:48:58,368 --> 00:48:59,596
All right, all right, all right.

609
00:50:23,503 --> 00:50:25,437
Sonny, come here. Bobby.

610
00:50:30,177 --> 00:50:31,337
Good seeing you.

611
00:50:32,212 --> 00:50:36,410
Bobby, give Sonny a good table
and a bottle of your best, on me.

612
00:50:38,151 --> 00:50:40,812
Why don't you get him a tailor
while you're at it?

613
00:51:17,376 --> 00:51:18,934
- What do you say, Curley?
- How's it going?

614
00:51:19,644 --> 00:51:21,771
This is Dean Blanford,
he's from Washington.

615
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,369
- Joe.
- Donnie.

616
00:51:23,481 --> 00:51:25,779
Call me Donnie.
I don't want to get confused.

617
00:51:26,283 --> 00:51:29,377
I know what you mean, pal.
Sometimes you get so busy,

618
00:51:29,487 --> 00:51:32,251
- even I forget my own name.
- Yeah, is that right?

619
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:34,449
Is it hard to cash checks?

620
00:51:35,793 --> 00:51:37,556
Dean's up from Washington.

621
00:51:39,597 --> 00:51:42,998
Yeah, you said that part already.
What's next?

622
00:51:43,667 --> 00:51:47,228
Now that the operation
is beginning to bear fruit

623
00:51:47,371 --> 00:51:51,671
headquarters decided to transfer me
up to Sin City here.

624
00:51:51,809 --> 00:51:54,004
- What for? You want to keep an eye on me?
- No.

625
00:51:54,145 --> 00:51:56,511
To make sure you receive
the proper support.

626
00:51:56,647 --> 00:52:00,583
- The proper support.
- And to make sure, in all the hubbub,

627
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:05,148
- there are no missed opportunities.
- Missed opportunities? Like what?

628
00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:08,689
We have an agent in Miami,
goes by the name of Richie Gazzo.

629
00:52:08,825 --> 00:52:11,692
- Miami?
- His operation is potentially very sweet.

630
00:52:11,828 --> 00:52:15,320
Problem is, it's starting to languish
right now and needs jump-starting.

631
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:17,831
The Bureau would like you
to go down there

632
00:52:17,967 --> 00:52:20,993
and see if you could interest
some of your mob friends.

633
00:52:21,104 --> 00:52:25,131
- If you vouch for Richie Gazzo...
- I ain't vouching for nobody I don't know.

634
00:52:25,909 --> 00:52:28,036
I was hoping
we'd get off on the right foot here.

635
00:52:28,178 --> 00:52:31,292
What's the big deal?
You just go down and vouch for the guy.

636
00:52:31,534 --> 00:52:32,626
Sit in the sun for a week.

637
00:52:32,735 --> 00:52:35,704
- If I vouch for the guy, I could wind up dead.
- So could he.

638
00:52:35,838 --> 00:52:39,069
You're not the only one out there
risking your life, bud.

639
00:52:42,578 --> 00:52:44,671
I'll let you know.

640
00:52:45,114 --> 00:52:46,672
I'll get back to you.

641
00:52:50,585 --> 00:52:52,018
He'll let us know?

642
00:52:55,523 --> 00:52:57,491
- Good evening. How many?
- Five.

643
00:52:58,026 --> 00:53:01,518
My wife says it's very in, Japanese.
She read about it in Parade magazine.

644
00:53:01,629 --> 00:53:03,529
Very big now.

645
00:53:06,468 --> 00:53:10,063
Have seat. Take off shoes. Please.

646
00:53:10,171 --> 00:53:12,639
- What kind of food is this?
- It's fish.

647
00:53:13,141 --> 00:53:15,939
- Please, take off shoes.
- Are you kidding me?

648
00:53:16,111 --> 00:53:18,773
Take off your pants. What's that?

649
00:53:19,414 --> 00:53:20,881
I'm afraid it's necessary.

650
00:53:20,982 --> 00:53:23,712
- It's Japanese tradition.
- Is that right?

651
00:53:23,985 --> 00:53:27,045
- Forget about it, I ain't doing it.
- I'm afraid it's necessary.

652
00:53:27,155 --> 00:53:29,953
Forget it, I ain't taking my fucking shoes off.

653
00:53:30,492 --> 00:53:31,652
- Hey, Donnie.
- What?

654
00:53:31,793 --> 00:53:33,589
When in Rome...

655
00:53:34,361 --> 00:53:37,262
Nicky, who won the fucking war?

656
00:53:39,333 --> 00:53:43,030
- War? What war?
- We did. Do you want to fight it again?

657
00:53:43,203 --> 00:53:45,763
- Take off your shoes.
- I ain't gonna do it.

658
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:48,672
- Take your shoes off.
- I ain't taking my shoes off.

659
00:53:48,809 --> 00:53:50,936
I want to eat sometime tonight.

660
00:53:51,145 --> 00:53:54,546
Take off your shoes,
or I'm gonna chop off your fucking feet.

661
00:53:54,715 --> 00:53:56,444
What do you want me to do?

662
00:53:56,550 --> 00:53:58,643
You want me to take orders
from a fucking Jap?

663
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:03,217
I grew up in an orphanage because
my old man was killed in Okinawa.

664
00:54:03,357 --> 00:54:06,121
You think I'm taking my shoes off
for this fucking prick?

665
00:54:06,226 --> 00:54:08,126
No, I ain't doing it.

666
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:14,619
I'm afraid it's necessary.

667
00:54:16,755 --> 00:54:20,122
Listen, my friend's not gonna
take off his shoes there, Mr. Moto.

668
00:54:20,225 --> 00:54:21,783
I'm afraid it's necessary.

669
00:54:21,894 --> 00:54:25,330
Neither are the rest of us.
So give us a table before I smack you.

670
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:27,523
You must take off your shoes.

671
00:54:38,477 --> 00:54:40,877
- You like shoes, you fuck?
- Get him down!

672
00:54:40,979 --> 00:54:42,537
You like shoes?

673
00:54:43,815 --> 00:54:45,009
Let me get in there.

674
00:54:55,627 --> 00:54:57,925
Slant-eyed motherfucker!

675
00:55:04,168 --> 00:55:06,762
- Come on. Let's go.
- Son of a bitch!

676
00:55:08,139 --> 00:55:12,041
- Watch him, Donnie!
- Stupid fuck!

677
00:55:13,344 --> 00:55:16,609
Kick the shit out of him, Donnie! Kick him!

678
00:55:16,847 --> 00:55:18,508
Use those fucking boots!

679
00:55:19,217 --> 00:55:22,345
Don't you move, you fuck.
Don't you fucking move.

680
00:55:43,707 --> 00:55:45,174
You like shoes, you fuck?

681
00:55:49,645 --> 00:55:51,896
Slant-eyed motherfucker!

682
00:55:57,607 --> 00:56:00,440
- Come on. Let's go.
- Son of a bitch!

683
00:56:01,777 --> 00:56:03,335
Watch him, Donnie!

684
00:56:04,914 --> 00:56:06,575
Stupid fuck!

685
00:56:07,049 --> 00:56:10,041
Kick the shit out of him, Donnie! Kick him!

686
00:56:18,594 --> 00:56:20,186
Mind your own business.

687
00:56:20,296 --> 00:56:22,093
Just go home! Go home!

688
00:56:28,903 --> 00:56:31,098
Go home, you miserable bitch.

689
00:56:32,173 --> 00:56:34,471
What you doing?
Sonny's ready to start.

690
00:56:34,609 --> 00:56:37,874
He's not done yet. You want him to piss
all over the fucking floor?

691
00:56:50,125 --> 00:56:53,959
...not sharing the cigars.
Up the block, they sell for $50 a box.

692
00:56:54,062 --> 00:56:55,529
We could sell them for $25.

693
00:56:55,630 --> 00:56:59,396
You give two or three of those to a broad,
she'll do anything you want.

694
00:56:59,501 --> 00:57:01,799
Give three Quaaludes to Brenda.
Maybe she'd cook.

695
00:57:01,903 --> 00:57:02,995
I doubt it.

696
00:57:03,104 --> 00:57:05,664
I got a guy that's in the middle
of this load of Sergio Valentes.

697
00:57:05,774 --> 00:57:08,436
A dime on the vig.

698
00:57:08,543 --> 00:57:11,170
- So, what do you got on the street?
- $100,000.

699
00:57:11,278 --> 00:57:13,803
That should be $250,000
by the end of the year.

700
00:57:15,616 --> 00:57:18,585
I can get these real cheap
and I got a guy who can move them.

701
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:20,816
Will you fucking stop that?

702
00:57:22,589 --> 00:57:24,819
How else am I supposed to open this?

703
00:57:25,893 --> 00:57:27,520
Open sesame!

704
00:57:27,761 --> 00:57:28,819
A score's a score.

705
00:57:28,929 --> 00:57:31,383
Boss, look what I got here. It's 100 pairs.

706
00:57:33,853 --> 00:57:37,152
Sonny Red's got $1 million a month
with his trucks in Jersey.

707
00:57:37,257 --> 00:57:39,657
What do I get?
Steak knives and parking meters.

708
00:57:39,759 --> 00:57:42,922
We ought to hijack an oil tanker.
There's a lot of money in oil.

709
00:57:43,063 --> 00:57:44,462
You know something?

710
00:57:44,931 --> 00:57:48,697
There's a guy I know down in Florida.
He says it's wide open down there.

711
00:57:50,136 --> 00:57:53,400
- Where in Florida?
- Florida. The beach.

712
00:57:54,707 --> 00:57:57,699
The whole economy's moving down there.
They call it the Sun Belt.

713
00:57:57,810 --> 00:58:00,108
The economy's got to be good
for us to make any real money.

714
00:58:00,245 --> 00:58:02,372
You don't think they got
their own wise guys in Florida?

715
00:58:02,481 --> 00:58:05,678
Florida and Arizona
because of the energy crisis.

716
00:58:05,784 --> 00:58:09,117
I heard a whole conversation
on the Long John Neville Show.

717
00:58:09,488 --> 00:58:13,390
Problem up here, you got 3,000 wise guys
all chasing the same fucking nickel.

718
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:16,955
You're from down there, Florida, Donnie?

719
00:58:17,563 --> 00:58:19,895
Lot of parking meters down in Florida.

720
00:58:29,703 --> 00:58:31,830
You guys think this is funny?

721
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:37,000
I'm the skipper now. I gotta answer!

722
00:58:38,077 --> 00:58:42,275
$50,000 a month, I kick up to Rusty.
Every month!

723
00:58:42,782 --> 00:58:44,579
One day, I'm gonna die.

724
00:58:44,684 --> 00:58:49,781
I'm gonna be here in this same room
with all these same fucking guys

725
00:58:50,356 --> 00:58:53,416
talking about the same fucking scams

726
00:58:54,127 --> 00:58:56,027
that never amount to nothing!

727
00:59:02,468 --> 00:59:05,460
That's how I'll know
that I've been sent to fucking hell.

728
00:59:05,671 --> 00:59:09,198
Joe, give these humps another drink.
It's all they're good for.

729
00:59:17,503 --> 00:59:21,836
I tell you right now, we better start earning
or somebody's gonna get clipped.

730
00:59:27,145 --> 00:59:29,375
Why did you inject that, Donnie,
with Florida?

731
00:59:30,014 --> 00:59:31,709
What are you talking about?
I didn't inject nothing.

732
00:59:31,816 --> 00:59:33,716
You injected that. Don't tell me no.

733
00:59:34,018 --> 00:59:36,919
I know you. You don't say nothing
unless there's a reason for it.

734
00:59:37,021 --> 00:59:39,990
Now, who is this fucking guy in Florida?

735
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:44,988
Nobody. He's a guy I knew
when I lived down there, that's all.

736
00:59:45,830 --> 00:59:47,058
You vouch for this guy?

737
00:59:47,165 --> 00:59:49,133
Hey, come on. That was bullshitting around.

738
00:59:49,233 --> 00:59:52,202
Bullshitting around? What, you think
Sonny Black is just bullshitting around?

739
00:59:52,303 --> 00:59:55,568
What do I know? I don't... You know...
You think he wasn't?

740
00:59:55,673 --> 01:00:00,007
Yeah, well... Listen to me, Donnie,
I don't know what to swear on.

741
01:00:00,111 --> 01:00:02,806
My dead father, my mother who I love,
my children.

742
01:00:02,913 --> 01:00:07,976
I swear to you, Donnie, something
is going on you don't know about.

743
01:00:08,084 --> 01:00:11,212
- I was making conversation with the guy.
- Mr. Smart Conversation,

744
01:00:11,354 --> 01:00:14,187
you tell me what happens

745
01:00:14,291 --> 01:00:17,124
if Sonny Black decides
he wants to go to Florida?

746
01:00:17,594 --> 01:00:20,154
Who said he's going to go to Florida?

747
01:00:20,263 --> 01:00:24,359
Donnie, don't think
you can pull the wool over my eyes.

748
01:00:24,468 --> 01:00:27,028
I see you siding up to Sonny Black.

749
01:00:27,137 --> 01:00:29,435
With my eyes, I'm looking at you.
You're doing it.

750
01:00:29,573 --> 01:00:32,974
- Come on.
- I ain't siding up to Sonny Black.

751
01:00:33,109 --> 01:00:36,135
He goes to Florida, you're responsible.

752
01:00:36,313 --> 01:00:38,543
And I'm responsible
because I represent you.

753
01:00:38,648 --> 01:00:40,445
Come on. I was just bullshitting around.

754
01:00:40,584 --> 01:00:43,781
You think you can trust Sonny Black.
You can't trust Sonny Black.

755
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:47,980
Sonny Black is one big, fat,
fucking snake in the...

756
01:00:48,524 --> 01:00:51,536
- Grass. Snake in the grass.
- You can't say that now.

757
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:54,715
Sonny Black is a skipper.
You don't open your mouth about him.

758
01:00:54,816 --> 01:00:58,718
Lefty, this fucking guy Richie calls me up.
He says,

759
01:00:59,988 --> 01:01:03,082
"I'm getting hassled
by a couple of half-assed wise guys."

760
01:01:03,191 --> 01:01:06,490
He's looking for a partner
to give him a little peace of mind.

761
01:01:06,628 --> 01:01:08,858
- He's got this nightclub to run down there.
- A nightclub?

762
01:01:08,997 --> 01:01:11,522
Got a singles bar. It's near the beach.

763
01:01:11,666 --> 01:01:13,657
I got two grenades in my house.

764
01:01:13,869 --> 01:01:17,168
I'd blow up all Mulberry Street
before I'd give you up. You understand?

765
01:01:17,305 --> 01:01:19,865
I don't know what I would do
if you did something wrong.

766
01:01:19,975 --> 01:01:23,138
You understand? I'd die with you.

767
01:02:02,650 --> 01:02:04,015
Come on!

768
01:02:05,786 --> 01:02:07,549
Come on, Four!

769
01:02:08,489 --> 01:02:09,888
Four!

770
01:02:18,698 --> 01:02:20,598
- Shit.
- That was in.

771
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:22,734
Bullshit. Knocked me so far...

772
01:02:24,938 --> 01:02:26,166
Don't push me!

773
01:02:27,707 --> 01:02:29,504
I'll break your fucking head.

774
01:02:38,203 --> 01:02:40,831
- Shit! He lives!
- What the fuck are you...

775
01:02:43,375 --> 01:02:44,399
Fuck!

776
01:02:47,713 --> 01:02:49,078
Jesus Christ.

777
01:02:52,184 --> 01:02:53,515
Half hour.

778
01:02:54,386 --> 01:02:56,945
- Where is this guy?
- I don't know, Left.

779
01:03:04,562 --> 01:03:06,962
- Is that him?
- Yeah, that's him.

780
01:03:13,304 --> 01:03:16,364
Don, you brought the cavalry.

781
01:03:16,608 --> 01:03:17,836
Richie Gazzo.

782
01:03:19,243 --> 01:03:21,040
- How you doing?
- How you doing?

783
01:03:21,913 --> 01:03:23,073
I'm late!

784
01:03:24,015 --> 01:03:27,542
You guys got a chance
to work on your suntans out here.

785
01:03:38,763 --> 01:03:42,220
Kings Court. Where every man is a king.

786
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:46,766
Wait until you get a load
of the banquet room. You're gonna plotz.

787
01:03:49,806 --> 01:03:52,172
Ask him why this place
is such a fucking dump.

788
01:03:53,777 --> 01:03:56,439
He wants to know
why it's such a dump, Richie.

789
01:03:57,948 --> 01:03:59,609
I had to shut the doors.

790
01:03:59,950 --> 01:04:01,975
The way these bums had their hands
in my pockets.

791
01:04:02,119 --> 01:04:04,781
You know, $200 for this, $300 for that.

792
01:04:04,921 --> 01:04:07,583
I got a wife who does that,
you know what I mean?

793
01:04:09,981 --> 01:04:11,708
Ask him to leave, Donnie.

794
01:04:12,615 --> 01:04:16,779
- Richie, step outside, take a look at the car.
- Sure. Great.

795
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:23,488
What kind of a man has a Malvole?
He won't provide for his own wife.

796
01:04:23,825 --> 01:04:27,124
- I'm telling you, this guy's all right.
- You vouch for him?

797
01:04:28,497 --> 01:04:31,523
- When I knew him before, he was all right...
- You vouch for the guy?

798
01:04:31,667 --> 01:04:35,660
I'm just making an introduction. You got
to make the decision about the joint.

799
01:04:39,174 --> 01:04:41,472
This would be something, you know,

800
01:04:42,077 --> 01:04:45,478
if we had my own lounge down here,
me and you.

801
01:04:46,048 --> 01:04:48,278
- You know?
- What about Sonny?

802
01:04:50,752 --> 01:04:53,220
Donnie, don't tell me what to do, Donnie.

803
01:04:53,321 --> 01:04:55,152
I'm asking a question.

804
01:04:55,724 --> 01:04:58,056
Donnie, Sonny's down here for a vacation.

805
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:00,128
He ain't once gotten out
of that chaise longue.

806
01:05:00,228 --> 01:05:02,423
He lies there like he's in fucking traction.

807
01:05:02,531 --> 01:05:06,432
Yeah, I know, but he did mention
that he might wanna get something going.

808
01:05:07,835 --> 01:05:11,430
Imagine Sonny Black operating down here.
The way he is?

809
01:05:12,306 --> 01:05:15,139
Come on. Sonny Black belongs in Brooklyn.

810
01:05:15,276 --> 01:05:18,336
I guess if everything worked out

811
01:05:19,313 --> 01:05:21,577
we could send a few fazools up there, no?

812
01:05:26,253 --> 01:05:29,518
Thirty years I'm busting my hump.
What do I got?

813
01:05:31,258 --> 01:05:33,988
Even a dog
gets a warm piece of the sidewalk.

814
01:05:36,497 --> 01:05:38,624
I ought to show something for what I did.

815
01:05:38,733 --> 01:05:40,860
- You know what I mean?
- Definitely.

816
01:05:41,869 --> 01:05:43,837
This ain't New York down here.

817
01:05:44,505 --> 01:05:48,464
New York with the politics,
all the old beefs and the grudges.

818
01:05:49,770 --> 01:05:54,631
Down here, a guy like me could sit down
with the boss.

819
01:05:56,736 --> 01:05:58,465
You know what I'm saying?

820
01:05:58,604 --> 01:06:01,971
Get out from under, be a free agent again.

821
01:06:03,442 --> 01:06:06,878
I'm telling you, Donnie, nothing but right.

822
01:06:45,784 --> 01:06:49,515
Lefty wants to ask Santo Trafficante
for permission to operate down here.

823
01:06:49,654 --> 01:06:52,487
- You got to give me a boat.
- We can't afford that kind of money.

824
01:06:52,624 --> 01:06:55,286
- What kind of a boat?
- I don't know. Like a 70-footer.

825
01:06:55,393 --> 01:06:59,090
- I want to take him out for the day.
- You're talking $6,000 a day here, Joe.

826
01:06:59,197 --> 01:07:01,495
Santo Trafficante is the boss of Florida.

827
01:07:01,633 --> 01:07:04,193
- He sits on the Commission. Did you know?
- I knew that.

828
01:07:04,335 --> 01:07:06,769
- A 70-foot boat?
- It's up to 80, actually.

829
01:07:06,871 --> 01:07:09,965
We just picked up Lefty on a wiretap
talking to one of Trafficante's guys.

830
01:07:10,074 --> 01:07:13,635
A few things to go over
to make a loan-sharking indictment.

831
01:07:13,812 --> 01:07:15,336
This is important!

832
01:07:15,979 --> 01:07:17,207
Ninety, actually.

833
01:07:17,347 --> 01:07:20,009
I did what you asked.
I came here and vouched for this guy.

834
01:07:20,150 --> 01:07:23,278
So what, I'm gonna take Santo Trafficante
out in a rubber ducky or what?

835
01:07:23,387 --> 01:07:25,321
We're gonna have to
wash your mouth out, bud.

836
01:07:25,422 --> 01:07:28,414
Does Sally Paintglass report to Nicky
or Nicky Cigars?

837
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:30,706
- Nicky Glasses.
- Nicky Glasses?

838
01:07:32,682 --> 01:07:35,913
As I was saying,
we've got to fold Sonny into the RICO...

839
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:40,250
- I need a boat for this fucking sit-down!
- I'm a Mormon, mister. Now clean it up.

840
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:41,948
Joe, I think you got a malfunction
on your tape recorder.

841
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:44,492
Get me a fucking boat, would you? What?

842
01:07:44,594 --> 01:07:46,562
I'm not getting anything here.

843
01:08:12,287 --> 01:08:14,619
I'm worried. He's getting strung-out.

844
01:08:15,791 --> 01:08:19,989
We're getting what we want. Fuck him.

845
01:08:22,130 --> 01:08:23,290
There it is.

846
01:08:27,302 --> 01:08:29,964
Just moving behind, nice and slow.

847
01:08:31,607 --> 01:08:33,575
Why don't you count it, my friend?
Go ahead.

848
01:08:33,976 --> 01:08:35,841
It's all there. No bullshit.

849
01:08:38,146 --> 01:08:39,579
We're bueno?

850
01:08:41,383 --> 01:08:43,976
Pleasure doing business
with you caballeros.

851
01:08:45,987 --> 01:08:48,455
Oh, Columbia, the gem of the ocean

852
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:51,287
The home of the brave and the free

853
01:08:59,066 --> 01:09:00,966
- Fuck.
- Fuck!

854
01:09:03,804 --> 01:09:07,535
What are you doing? You want to
throw me in the pool? You got the balls?

855
01:09:07,842 --> 01:09:09,769
He hasn't made a pick yet.

856
01:09:09,868 --> 01:09:11,854
Forget those dogs.

857
01:09:12,332 --> 01:09:15,392
Hey, you know,
if you took my blood pressure right now,

858
01:09:16,069 --> 01:09:18,469
it'd be down 100%.

859
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:22,406
Rusty's locked up in the can
with his fucking sinuses.

860
01:09:22,509 --> 01:09:24,704
He finds out you're down in Florida...

861
01:09:27,613 --> 01:09:29,808
I don't punch a clock for Rusty.

862
01:09:30,416 --> 01:09:32,407
Live your life like a man down here.

863
01:09:32,518 --> 01:09:34,213
Forget about it, Sonny. By tomorrow,

864
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:36,811
you're gonna be crying
you miss the New York bread.

865
01:09:36,923 --> 01:09:39,016
New York bread is like cake.

866
01:09:40,293 --> 01:09:43,091
Hey, two weeks you're wearing
the same fucking shirt.

867
01:09:43,195 --> 01:09:44,719
What does that mean?

868
01:09:47,466 --> 01:09:49,161
What does that mean?

869
01:09:51,504 --> 01:09:54,268
I'm not in a big hurry
to go back to New York.

870
01:09:54,373 --> 01:09:57,137
Yeah, don't worry about it. One more day,

871
01:09:57,476 --> 01:10:00,309
that fucking shirt's gonna go back
to New York on its own.

872
01:10:00,413 --> 01:10:02,040
That's why we don't get service in this joint.

873
01:10:02,148 --> 01:10:05,584
They see you in that fucking shirt, they say,
"There's Joe Faccia Di Culo," in that shirt.

874
01:10:08,954 --> 01:10:10,182
That's enough.

875
01:10:10,822 --> 01:10:14,019
"That's enough?"
What does that mean, "that's enough"?

876
01:10:15,994 --> 01:10:18,485
Look at him, look at him. He's mad.

877
01:10:19,998 --> 01:10:22,398
- Hey, Donnie, let's go for a walk.
- Where?

878
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:25,560
- Come on, I'm gonna get a candy bar.
- All right.

879
01:10:25,770 --> 01:10:28,796
Look at him, that was once yellow,
that shirt.

880
01:10:32,210 --> 01:10:35,270
What are we supposed to call him now?
Sonny Florida.

881
01:10:36,730 --> 01:10:39,494
Watch out, you're gonna put him
on the warpath again.

882
01:10:39,599 --> 01:10:40,566
Yeah.

883
01:10:41,301 --> 01:10:45,294
That shirt. That's the shirt the barber
gives you to put over your shirt.

884
01:10:52,131 --> 01:10:54,530
I want to know what you're up to.

885
01:10:54,833 --> 01:10:57,358
- What do you mean?
- Yesterday.

886
01:10:59,704 --> 01:11:01,069
Last night?

887
01:11:01,539 --> 01:11:03,530
What were you doing last night?

888
01:11:03,675 --> 01:11:07,202
No, I'm saying, when yesterday?
What time yesterday?

889
01:11:07,312 --> 01:11:11,715
Come here. Don't mess around with me.
Yesterday fucking afternoon.

890
01:11:13,084 --> 01:11:14,312
Nothing.

891
01:11:14,919 --> 01:11:17,285
Why has Lefty got such a hard-on
to send me back to New York?

892
01:11:17,389 --> 01:11:20,222
Oh, come on, Sonny.
That guy's busting your balls down there.

893
01:11:20,325 --> 01:11:21,815
I wanna know.

894
01:11:24,996 --> 01:11:27,362
I wanna know what you got
going on down here.

895
01:11:27,465 --> 01:11:28,523
I don't understand, Sonny.

896
01:11:28,633 --> 01:11:30,863
You wanna know about every
half-assed scam that'll amount to nothing?

897
01:11:30,969 --> 01:11:32,402
That's right.

898
01:11:35,507 --> 01:11:36,632
Look.

899
01:11:38,142 --> 01:11:39,973
I don't mean any disrespect.

900
01:11:40,077 --> 01:11:41,977
I mean, I know you're a skipper
and I'm a nobody,

901
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:45,310
but I can't do that to Lefty.

902
01:11:45,416 --> 01:11:48,579
Listen to me, you cocksucker,
I'll eat your fucking balls for breakfast.

903
01:11:48,686 --> 01:11:51,553
You understand me?
Every fucking one of you.

904
01:11:52,556 --> 01:11:55,821
This is life or death.
Not a fucking game, Donnie.

905
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:59,789
This is my say-so. Now, you tell me.

906
01:12:02,566 --> 01:12:04,193
I can't do it, Sonny.

907
01:12:04,301 --> 01:12:07,566
How about if I fucking whack you
right here and now?

908
01:12:10,007 --> 01:12:12,202
Do what you have to do, Sonny.

909
01:12:12,476 --> 01:12:14,444
I can't do that to Lefty.

910
01:12:46,962 --> 01:12:48,953
- Mommy, I need some help.
- Hello?

911
01:12:49,131 --> 01:12:50,120
- Hey.
- Hey.

912
01:12:50,265 --> 01:12:52,256
- It's too tight.
- Here, sweetie.

913
01:12:52,601 --> 01:12:54,933
- I'm in Florida.
- What are you doing in Florida?

914
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:57,335
I don't know. I'm hunting for turtles.

915
01:12:57,473 --> 01:13:00,135
What do you think I'm doing in Florida?
Honey, I'm working.

916
01:13:00,242 --> 01:13:03,540
It's 12 degrees here.
Excuse me, you're wearing this coat!

917
01:13:04,345 --> 01:13:06,870
Young lady, you are wearing this coat.

918
01:13:07,048 --> 01:13:08,777
- Bitch.
- What did you call me?

919
01:13:08,883 --> 01:13:10,544
- Is everything all right?
- What did you...

920
01:13:10,685 --> 01:13:12,710
What if I said no, Joe?
Would it make any difference?

921
01:13:12,854 --> 01:13:15,482
- I guess not.
- So don't ask me. Come on, stand up.

922
01:13:16,591 --> 01:13:19,651
"John Wayne dead. Nation mourns."

923
01:13:24,232 --> 01:13:26,200
How can John Wayne die?

924
01:13:27,902 --> 01:13:29,961
The fucking Indians got him.

925
01:13:31,272 --> 01:13:35,368
"Old-fashioned family man.
Ruled with an iron hand."

926
01:13:35,877 --> 01:13:37,037
Look at that.

927
01:13:45,919 --> 01:13:48,410
Let me talk to Kerry.
I want to talk about the Communion.

928
01:13:48,755 --> 01:13:50,882
My God, Joe. She doesn't want to do it.

929
01:13:50,991 --> 01:13:53,221
What do you mean? She ain't got no choice.

930
01:13:53,326 --> 01:13:55,920
- You are wearing this coat!
- Put her on the phone, Maggie.

931
01:13:56,062 --> 01:13:59,623
I don't know when I can call again.
Does she know not to bite the wafer?

932
01:13:59,766 --> 01:14:01,734
I don't know. She's acting out or something.

933
01:14:01,835 --> 01:14:03,735
- I'll be back next week.
- Thank you.

934
01:14:03,837 --> 01:14:06,362
Maggie, I promise I'll get back
for her Communion.

935
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:09,727
- Yours doesn't look any better.
- Don't start it with your sister.

936
01:14:09,834 --> 01:14:11,763
- Joe, I got to go.
- What?

937
01:14:12,298 --> 01:14:13,765
I love you. Shit.

938
01:14:14,934 --> 01:14:18,233
- Who's that on the phone? Richie?
- No. What did Sonny say?

939
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:23,807
- You told Sonny about the club?
- No, I thought you did.

940
01:14:23,976 --> 01:14:27,605
- Just shut up about it. Call Richie.
- All right.

941
01:14:42,394 --> 01:14:45,830
Big guy like Santo Trafficante,
he's been around

942
01:14:46,231 --> 01:14:48,324
since the Mustache Petes.

943
01:14:48,533 --> 01:14:50,467
You gotta respect the man.

944
01:14:50,569 --> 01:14:53,129
- Donnie, you get that boat yet?
- No, I'm working on it.

945
01:14:53,338 --> 01:14:55,932
Don't tell me no. You got to get that boat.

946
01:14:57,542 --> 01:15:01,337
I reached out already.
His man says, "Lefty, he loves boats."

947
01:15:01,441 --> 01:15:03,875
I told him a 100-foot boat.
I'm on the clothesline now.

948
01:15:04,010 --> 01:15:05,705
I told you, I'm working on it.

949
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:10,878
- Don't disappoint me again, please.
- Again? Since when did I disappoint you?

950
01:15:11,017 --> 01:15:12,916
Forget about it. What's this?

951
01:15:13,452 --> 01:15:15,920
Look at that. Same thing we call each other.

952
01:15:16,088 --> 01:15:18,750
Friend of mine, friend of ours. Good.

953
01:15:18,858 --> 01:15:21,383
But there's the double meaning. You get it?

954
01:15:22,061 --> 01:15:23,255
- Know what I mean?
- Yeah.

955
01:15:23,395 --> 01:15:26,387
- A boss appreciates a thing like that.
- Yeah.

956
01:15:26,732 --> 01:15:29,428
- The irony of it.
- Yeah, irony.

957
01:15:29,869 --> 01:15:32,770
Forget about it. Put a beaner inside here,

958
01:15:32,905 --> 01:15:34,873
then he knows these are men of men.

959
01:15:34,974 --> 01:15:37,568
You see, if I work out the strategy right,

960
01:15:37,877 --> 01:15:39,936
you got to hold up your end now.

961
01:15:40,079 --> 01:15:41,774
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah, I know.

962
01:15:41,914 --> 01:15:44,576
You got to hold up your end now.
You know what I'm saying?

963
01:15:44,683 --> 01:15:47,652
How much is this?
Donnie, you got something on you?

964
01:15:48,020 --> 01:15:50,702
- What are you doing there?
- How about here's $5?

965
01:15:52,944 --> 01:15:56,037
- You're doing an amazing job, you know.
- What?

966
01:15:56,647 --> 01:16:00,083
- I mean, we all think so.
- Yeah. Absolutely.

967
01:16:02,453 --> 01:16:04,546
For crying out loud. Fuck.

968
01:16:07,525 --> 01:16:09,425
- Can I ask you something?
- What?

969
01:16:09,527 --> 01:16:12,928
What's "forget about it"? What is that?

970
01:16:14,131 --> 01:16:16,326
"Forget about it" is like

971
01:16:17,968 --> 01:16:19,833
if you agree with someone.

972
01:16:20,738 --> 01:16:24,469
Like, "Raquel Welch is one great
piece of ass." "Forget about it."

973
01:16:24,742 --> 01:16:28,303
But then, if you disagree, like,
"A Lincoln is better than a Cadillac?

974
01:16:28,412 --> 01:16:29,845
"Forget about it."

975
01:16:30,881 --> 01:16:33,782
It's also like if something
is the greatest thing in the world.

976
01:16:33,884 --> 01:16:36,853
Like "Minghia, those peppers!
Forget about it!" You know?

977
01:16:38,355 --> 01:16:40,720
It's also like saying, "Go to hell," too.

978
01:16:41,591 --> 01:16:46,460
Like, "Paulie, you got a one-inch pecker."
And Paulie says, "Forget about it."

979
01:16:46,829 --> 01:16:49,821
Forget about it. "Paulie, forget about it."

980
01:16:52,402 --> 01:16:56,338
Sometimes it just means, forget about it.

981
01:16:57,774 --> 01:17:00,538
All right. Thank you very much. I got it.

982
01:17:00,910 --> 01:17:04,346
Let me tell you something.
I don't get this boat for Lefty...

983
01:17:04,948 --> 01:17:08,008
- Forget about it?
- Fucking forget about it.

984
01:17:08,151 --> 01:17:12,053
You know that sting operation?
What do you call it?

985
01:17:12,956 --> 01:17:16,414
Where the agents dress up like Arabs
and try to bribe congressmen?

986
01:17:19,095 --> 01:17:20,858
- They got a boat down here.
- What?

987
01:17:20,964 --> 01:17:23,898
- Abscam.
- That's right. It's Abscam.

988
01:17:24,499 --> 01:17:26,364
Yeah? Could we get it?

989
01:17:28,203 --> 01:17:29,531
Forget about it.

990
01:17:36,965 --> 01:17:38,592
Son of a bitch!

991
01:17:39,033 --> 01:17:41,024
Come on, son of...

992
01:17:41,402 --> 01:17:43,336
Fucking Donnie.

993
01:17:43,438 --> 01:17:47,135
Hey, Lefty,
you're not gonna fucking believe this.

994
01:17:47,308 --> 01:17:49,299
- You think this is some joke, huh?
- What?

995
01:17:49,410 --> 01:17:51,742
- You think this is funny, huh?
- What are you talking about?

996
01:17:51,846 --> 01:17:53,746
It's fucking cold. Why is it so cold in here?

997
01:17:53,848 --> 01:17:58,251
Hey, Donnie. Listen to me, Donnie.
I know you know, all right?

998
01:17:58,486 --> 01:18:01,216
And I know you know I know you know.

999
01:18:01,756 --> 01:18:03,018
- Right.
- Right.

1000
01:18:03,124 --> 01:18:04,421
What the fuck are you talking about?

1001
01:18:04,525 --> 01:18:07,823
I'm telling you, I'm freezing
to my fucking death, Donnie.

1002
01:18:07,928 --> 01:18:10,829
Yeah, fucking Greenland in here.

1003
01:18:11,098 --> 01:18:12,360
There's no knob. Where's the knob?

1004
01:18:12,466 --> 01:18:13,694
Thank you.

1005
01:18:14,301 --> 01:18:16,462
Well, did you call the maintenance guy?
They gotta have a...

1006
01:18:16,570 --> 01:18:18,902
Maintenance. I'm not gonna call
a maintenance guy. What are you, crazy?

1007
01:18:19,006 --> 01:18:21,668
Who knows a maintenance guy comes in,
what if he's an agent? Come on.

1008
01:18:21,775 --> 01:18:23,709
Come on, he's not an agent.
He's a fucking janitor.

1009
01:18:23,810 --> 01:18:25,402
Janitor, come on.
I don't want him touching it.

1010
01:18:25,512 --> 01:18:28,106
Put his hands on it. Who knows what
he puts in the goddamn air-conditioner.

1011
01:18:28,215 --> 01:18:31,309
Here, look at this. Here, look, look.
I got it up to 120, here. Come on.

1012
01:18:31,418 --> 01:18:34,546
Ain't no fucking...
I'm not gonna have anyone going in here.

1013
01:18:34,655 --> 01:18:37,886
You know something?
That's a fucking practical joke.

1014
01:18:37,991 --> 01:18:39,390
- That's what that is.
- It's a joke?

1015
01:18:39,493 --> 01:18:41,324
- Yeah.
- Where's the joke? I don't see the joke.

1016
01:18:41,428 --> 01:18:43,919
Come on, you know Sonny's
sense of humor. It's Sonny fucking around.

1017
01:18:44,031 --> 01:18:45,225
- You think this is Sonny?
- Yeah.

1018
01:18:45,332 --> 01:18:46,765
- Sonny?
- Yeah.

1019
01:18:46,867 --> 01:18:50,427
Sonny did this to me?
This is not Sonny Black, my friend.

1020
01:18:51,003 --> 01:18:54,962
No. This is you, Donnie.
You fucking cocksucker, it's you!

1021
01:18:55,074 --> 01:18:57,065
Whoa, you don't fucking call me that, Lefty.

1022
01:18:57,176 --> 01:18:59,667
- Don't call you what?
- Don't you fucking call me cocksucker.

1023
01:18:59,779 --> 01:19:02,145
Cocksucker. I'll call you anything I want.
I'll call you cocksucker.

1024
01:19:02,248 --> 01:19:04,239
Yeah, I'll call you cocksucker.
I'll call you motherfucker!

1025
01:19:04,350 --> 01:19:06,511
Yeah, you're a fucking cocksucker.

1026
01:19:07,853 --> 01:19:10,831
- You calling me a cocksucker?
- Yeah, you like that?

1027
01:19:11,243 --> 01:19:12,904
- I'm a what?
- Cocksucker.

1028
01:19:13,011 --> 01:19:15,275
- I'm a cocksucker?
- You're a cocksucker.

1029
01:19:18,717 --> 01:19:21,151
What are you gonna do?
You're gonna kill me over a fucking draft?

1030
01:19:21,253 --> 01:19:22,618
- Yeah.
- Let me tell you something.

1031
01:19:22,721 --> 01:19:23,688
You'd better fucking kill me.

1032
01:19:23,789 --> 01:19:25,723
Because you don't kill me tonight,
I'm gonna come in here,

1033
01:19:25,824 --> 01:19:28,315
I'm gonna chop you up and then...
I'll sneak in here and fucking kill you.

1034
01:19:28,427 --> 01:19:29,724
Oh yeah, you don't call me cocksucker.

1035
01:19:29,828 --> 01:19:31,796
Here.

1036
01:19:33,497 --> 01:19:35,226
Oh, yeah, go ahead.

1037
01:19:35,499 --> 01:19:38,059
- Cocksucker.
- Go ahead. Take it back.

1038
01:19:38,803 --> 01:19:40,168
- Kill me.
- Take it back, Donnie.

1039
01:19:40,271 --> 01:19:42,102
Fuck you, I'm getting my own room.

1040
01:19:42,239 --> 01:19:43,934
I'll see you tomorrow.

1041
01:19:44,275 --> 01:19:47,540
You're not gonna see me tomorrow,
for your information.

1042
01:19:47,645 --> 01:19:51,604
I got news for you, Donnie.
You won't see me tomorrow.

1043
01:19:52,016 --> 01:19:54,507
Tomorrow is Mother's Day,

1044
01:19:54,618 --> 01:19:57,587
and wise guys don't work on Mother's Day!

1045
01:19:57,688 --> 01:19:59,315
You're a cocksucker.

1046
01:20:03,294 --> 01:20:04,556
Go ahead!

1047
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:10,726
No!

1048
01:20:12,136 --> 01:20:14,570
Give me a break! No!

1049
01:20:15,206 --> 01:20:18,003
Are you trying to get me killed
with that fucking suit?

1050
01:20:18,141 --> 01:20:20,405
Fucking car. That purple, fucking car.

1051
01:20:20,510 --> 01:20:23,138
Don't say the word "plotz."
You understand?

1052
01:20:25,482 --> 01:20:27,109
Get in the back.

1053
01:20:39,229 --> 01:20:41,561
Wait a minute. I'll be there.

1054
01:20:48,772 --> 01:20:51,056
Mr. Trafficante, this is Lefty,
a friend of ours.

1055
01:20:51,193 --> 01:20:52,888
I don't know what to say.

1056
01:20:53,229 --> 01:20:55,789
To me, this is like a great moment in my life.

1057
01:20:56,365 --> 01:20:58,356
It's like meeting Mickey Mantle.

1058
01:20:59,267 --> 01:21:01,667
That's the boat I arranged for you,
Mr. Trafficante.

1059
01:21:01,770 --> 01:21:05,900
It's got everything.
Got a full bar, any kind of music you want.

1060
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:08,838
You want to make a telephone,
it's got telephones.

1061
01:21:09,010 --> 01:21:11,843
- Any questions, you ask me.
- Where's Sonny Black?

1062
01:21:13,081 --> 01:21:14,844
- Sonny Black?
- Yeah.

1063
01:21:16,117 --> 01:21:18,551
Everybody, out. Come on, baby.

1064
01:21:18,653 --> 01:21:20,951
- It's beautiful!
- What did I tell you?

1065
01:21:25,226 --> 01:21:28,627
You brought the family.
Hey, Paul, what do you know?

1066
01:21:28,763 --> 01:21:30,094
- Nice boat.
- What do you say, Paulie?

1067
01:21:30,231 --> 01:21:31,926
Where's Gilligan?

1068
01:21:33,768 --> 01:21:35,429
Now, that's what I call a boat.

1069
01:21:35,570 --> 01:21:37,561
Yeah, I would be... Yeah.

1070
01:21:38,807 --> 01:21:39,967
Here.

1071
01:22:19,813 --> 01:22:23,510
Sure, you can operate here.
You got to show a little respect.

1072
01:22:48,227 --> 01:22:49,751
Hey! Over here.

1073
01:23:03,742 --> 01:23:05,733
I don't even want to look at you.

1074
01:23:05,978 --> 01:23:09,674
- You know what the bow is?
- What did I do now?

1075
01:23:09,814 --> 01:23:12,112
You stabbed the wrong guy
in the back, my friend.

1076
01:23:12,250 --> 01:23:15,447
What are you talking about?
You think I said something to Sonny?

1077
01:23:15,586 --> 01:23:17,417
Go to the bow. I'm gonna stay in the stern.

1078
01:23:17,521 --> 01:23:19,614
Go to the bow. Stay there.

1079
01:23:21,192 --> 01:23:23,387
I'm so disgusted with you, you know that?

1080
01:23:23,494 --> 01:23:26,429
- You just said it.
- Just so you know.

1081
01:23:39,377 --> 01:23:42,403
- How you doing?
- That Trafficante is something else.

1082
01:23:42,513 --> 01:23:46,847
- Is that right? Is he a good old guy?
- Forget about it.

1083
01:23:46,984 --> 01:23:50,283
That motherfucker had this all to himself
for 50 fucking years

1084
01:23:50,388 --> 01:23:52,480
and it's still a cow town.

1085
01:23:53,023 --> 01:23:55,583
This could be like Vegas down here.

1086
01:23:56,493 --> 01:23:59,428
Forget about Sonny Red
and his trucks in Jersey.

1087
01:23:59,529 --> 01:24:01,724
This is all I want. Florida.

1088
01:24:01,932 --> 01:24:06,232
Tell you something. Sonny Red
is freezing his nuts off right now.

1089
01:24:08,905 --> 01:24:10,722
That's for sure.

1090
01:24:12,194 --> 01:24:14,856
All I need is the start-up money from Rusty

1091
01:24:14,997 --> 01:24:16,021
and then we all get rich.

1092
01:24:16,165 --> 01:24:18,224
Are we heading
back to New York pretty soon?

1093
01:24:18,367 --> 01:24:21,894
Not you. I want you to represent me
down here, Donnie.

1094
01:24:22,538 --> 01:24:25,063
I want you to be my man in Florida.

1095
01:24:25,441 --> 01:24:28,376
Get that club going. You know, Kings Court.

1096
01:24:37,752 --> 01:24:40,346
You didn't think I knew about that, did you?

1097
01:24:41,756 --> 01:24:44,452
I think I'll send the lion down here with you.

1098
01:24:44,659 --> 01:24:47,059
Keep that big pussy in the parking lot.

1099
01:24:49,097 --> 01:24:52,225
You know, Sonny, I really appreciate
the offer and everything,

1100
01:24:52,334 --> 01:24:54,928
but I got a lot of things going on
in New York.

1101
01:24:55,070 --> 01:24:59,131
- I'd like to keep them...
- Lefty's a dynamite guy. No doubt about it.

1102
01:24:59,274 --> 01:25:01,742
He looked after me when I was in the can.

1103
01:25:02,010 --> 01:25:04,035
That's something I don't forget,

1104
01:25:04,145 --> 01:25:06,636
something that I will never ever forget.

1105
01:25:06,848 --> 01:25:10,648
He's a stand-up guy.
He really cares about you, too.

1106
01:25:11,086 --> 01:25:12,986
Yeah, I know he does.

1107
01:25:14,422 --> 01:25:17,619
The problem is that
you think that he's helping you,

1108
01:25:17,759 --> 01:25:19,589
but he's hurting you.

1109
01:25:20,761 --> 01:25:23,229
He gets those two or three wines in him...

1110
01:25:23,597 --> 01:25:25,758
You know what I'm saying.

1111
01:25:30,137 --> 01:25:32,128
I don't want to be
stepping on nobody's toes.

1112
01:25:32,239 --> 01:25:34,935
- If it wasn't for Left, I...
- That's it. Look.

1113
01:25:37,878 --> 01:25:39,709
You belong to me now.

1114
01:25:42,216 --> 01:25:43,376
That's it.

1115
01:25:53,513 --> 01:25:55,640
Mr. Trafficante's leaving.

1116
01:25:59,019 --> 01:26:01,647
- You believe that?
- Ulcers, Christ, they're killing me.

1117
01:26:01,755 --> 01:26:03,119
Come here.

1118
01:26:04,223 --> 01:26:05,713
Santo, this is Donnie.

1119
01:26:05,858 --> 01:26:08,952
- He's a friend of ours.
- Hi, Donnie. Nice to meet you.

1120
01:26:10,896 --> 01:26:13,228
- This is Donnie.
- Hi, how you doing?

1121
01:26:24,443 --> 01:26:26,240
- Give my best to Joe, will you?
- I will.

1122
01:26:26,378 --> 01:26:29,108
Snowed in. Can you believe him?

1123
01:26:29,448 --> 01:26:33,441
Right. His daughter's First Communion,
and he gets stuck at an airport.

1124
01:26:34,153 --> 01:26:37,281
That's for his own protection.
I'll see you later. Okay?

1125
01:26:37,423 --> 01:26:40,290
- I hate flying.
- I know you do. Be safe.

1126
01:26:43,162 --> 01:26:44,720
Oh, sweetheart.

1127
01:26:49,934 --> 01:26:51,094
Honey.

1128
01:26:52,904 --> 01:26:56,897
Your father is so proud of you.

1129
01:27:00,378 --> 01:27:02,141
I'm going upstairs.

1130
01:27:10,988 --> 01:27:12,615
God damn it, Joe.

1131
01:27:18,162 --> 01:27:20,790
The number you have dialed
has been changed.

1132
01:27:21,032 --> 01:27:24,433
The new number is unpublished
at the subscriber's request.

1133
01:27:50,613 --> 01:27:53,514
Hey, Left, get us checked in over there,
will you?

1134
01:27:59,222 --> 01:28:01,918
- Stick around. I'm going to get a paper.
- All right.

1135
01:28:07,363 --> 01:28:11,163
Jesus, Joe. That's Hollman, US Attorney,
coming at us.

1136
01:28:11,300 --> 01:28:14,325
The guy on the right.
Christ, Joe, what are we going to do?

1137
01:28:15,270 --> 01:28:17,830
Why don't you just shut the fuck up?
I'll take care of it.

1138
01:28:23,912 --> 01:28:25,903
Anything goes wrong down there,

1139
01:28:26,014 --> 01:28:29,609
you have their people call your people
in New York, understand?

1140
01:28:29,784 --> 01:28:32,617
I don't want to come down here
and iron anything out.

1141
01:28:32,754 --> 01:28:35,245
- You got your plane tickets?
- Joe Pistone.

1142
01:28:37,459 --> 01:28:39,620
Remember me? Southern District...

1143
01:28:39,761 --> 01:28:42,252
What kind of fucking shit...

1144
01:28:43,865 --> 01:28:45,560
- What are you doing?
- Grabbed my cock.

1145
01:28:45,667 --> 01:28:46,656
What the fuck!

1146
01:28:46,801 --> 01:28:50,237
Shut up. He's working.
Keep your mouth shut.

1147
01:28:50,705 --> 01:28:53,731
Fucking degenerate bastard.
What a sick fuck. Grabbed my cock.

1148
01:28:53,842 --> 01:28:57,106
I want that club up and running.
I don't care how long it takes.

1149
01:28:57,211 --> 01:28:59,475
Here comes a fucking cop.
Get the hell out of here.

1150
01:28:59,613 --> 01:29:02,673
Have a safe trip.
You have the tickets and everything?

1151
01:29:05,119 --> 01:29:06,279
Listen to me.

1152
01:29:06,387 --> 01:29:09,835
Get on the phone.
Get me on the next flight back. Understand?

1153
01:29:10,510 --> 01:29:13,308
Don't call me Joe again.
I'll cut your fucking throat, understand?

1154
01:29:13,413 --> 01:29:15,142
You piece of shit.

1155
01:29:49,148 --> 01:29:52,117
- Daddy?
- Hi, baby.

1156
01:29:58,224 --> 01:30:00,283
- Who made you?
- God made me.

1157
01:30:00,993 --> 01:30:04,394
- Why did God make you?
- God made me to show his goodness

1158
01:30:04,496 --> 01:30:06,691
to make me happy with him in heaven.

1159
01:30:06,799 --> 01:30:09,393
- Where is God?
- God is everywhere.

1160
01:30:16,675 --> 01:30:18,199
Sweet dreams, angel.

1161
01:31:00,137 --> 01:31:01,798
I want a divorce.

1162
01:31:05,408 --> 01:31:07,103
He comes home at all hours of the night

1163
01:31:07,210 --> 01:31:10,873
without announcing when, why, or where
he's been for the last three months.

1164
01:31:12,715 --> 01:31:16,014
And you know what he does?
He rearranges the cabinets.

1165
01:31:17,253 --> 01:31:19,517
He remakes the bed.
He vacuums the entire house.

1166
01:31:19,622 --> 01:31:22,750
Do you know another man that vacuums?
It's abnormal.

1167
01:31:22,892 --> 01:31:25,190
- It's abnormal behavior.
- Well, you know,

1168
01:31:25,295 --> 01:31:28,594
changing the phone number and
not telling your husband is pretty normal.

1169
01:31:28,731 --> 01:31:31,825
- I don't exist, you don't exist.
- So now I know how it feels.

1170
01:31:32,035 --> 01:31:35,937
No, now I know how you feel.
I'll tell you something. It felt good.

1171
01:31:36,639 --> 01:31:39,767
Now I do know how it feels
to be so in control.

1172
01:31:40,405 --> 01:31:42,703
Now I know how it feels to be strong.

1173
01:31:44,876 --> 01:31:46,867
- You love control, don't you?
- Oh, my God.

1174
01:31:46,978 --> 01:31:48,377
Please, Joe, just listen.

1175
01:31:48,479 --> 01:31:51,675
Otherwise you just play out
the old pathology.

1176
01:31:53,784 --> 01:31:55,911
Maggie, you were saying Joe leaves.

1177
01:31:56,920 --> 01:31:58,444
Yes, he leaves.

1178
01:32:00,023 --> 01:32:03,220
He leaves me with the house

1179
01:32:03,327 --> 01:32:06,888
and the kids and the bills,
but not a husband.

1180
01:32:09,633 --> 01:32:11,328
I want my husband.

1181
01:32:16,606 --> 01:32:19,302
What do you think you're running from?

1182
01:32:23,647 --> 01:32:27,083
- I ain't running from nothing.
- "I ain't running from nothing."

1183
01:32:27,184 --> 01:32:30,298
You hear yourself?
The man I married was a college man.

1184
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:35,100
Being the distancer
forces Maggie into the role of the pursuer.

1185
01:32:35,544 --> 01:32:38,069
This gives you a feeling of power.

1186
01:32:38,447 --> 01:32:41,314
Simultaneously, you resent Maggie

1187
01:32:41,550 --> 01:32:46,044
- for fulfilling her intimacy needs...
- I'm an undercover agent for the FBI, Doctor.

1188
01:32:47,356 --> 01:32:49,722
You and your Mafia faggots
can go screw each other.

1189
01:32:49,858 --> 01:32:51,485
I'm not gonna do it anymore.

1190
01:32:51,593 --> 01:32:53,151
I really hope that you can help her out

1191
01:32:53,261 --> 01:32:55,286
because obviously she's very sick.
You can see that.

1192
01:32:55,397 --> 01:32:58,230
Obviously, I'm the sick one.

1193
01:32:58,900 --> 01:33:00,663
- You.
- Now,

1194
01:33:01,069 --> 01:33:05,631
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday
are Joe's intimacy days.

1195
01:33:06,274 --> 01:33:09,300
Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday
are Maggie's.

1196
01:33:09,544 --> 01:33:13,173
Now, on your day,
you make an intimacy request.

1197
01:33:13,749 --> 01:33:15,545
"Rub my back," or

1198
01:33:16,350 --> 01:33:19,513
"I have a problem with the kids.
Could you help me out?"

1199
01:33:21,021 --> 01:33:23,319
You sit around in
your safe little fucking house

1200
01:33:23,424 --> 01:33:27,360
with your safe little fucking station wagon,
and your safe little friends.

1201
01:33:27,461 --> 01:33:29,952
You dream up the next $100 head fuck.

1202
01:33:30,097 --> 01:33:33,533
- "Will you rub my back?"
- You're an animal, do you know that?

1203
01:33:33,667 --> 01:33:36,966
- Just get in the fucking car.
- Do you know that?

1204
01:33:38,005 --> 01:33:40,565
You know what my intimacy request is
for that guy?

1205
01:33:40,674 --> 01:33:41,868
It's very intimate.

1206
01:33:41,976 --> 01:33:44,706
He can take the bill he's gonna send me
and shove it up his ass.

1207
01:33:44,812 --> 01:33:46,712
You want to know why we went to him?

1208
01:33:46,814 --> 01:33:50,375
I was hoping he could come up with
one good reason for me not to leave you

1209
01:33:50,484 --> 01:33:52,611
because I don't have one anymore.

1210
01:33:56,290 --> 01:33:58,554
What? You gonna leave me?

1211
01:33:58,658 --> 01:34:02,492
You gonna leave me, Maggie?
You don't leave me.

1212
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:11,188
- Hello.
- Hey, Annette.

1213
01:34:11,323 --> 01:34:13,018
Donnie.

1214
01:34:13,192 --> 01:34:15,319
- What's the matter?
- Where are you?

1215
01:34:19,999 --> 01:34:22,832
I'm in New York. I had to come back. Why?

1216
01:34:23,836 --> 01:34:26,703
- It's Tommy.
- Why, what's going on? What happened?

1217
01:34:27,339 --> 01:34:30,172
Can you give your sister
some vegetables, honey? Thank you.

1218
01:34:30,309 --> 01:34:34,040
Not with your fingers, sweetie.
What else do you need?

1219
01:34:39,218 --> 01:34:42,118
We did fractions with Miss Greenberg today
in class, you know?

1220
01:34:43,021 --> 01:34:44,488
Did you? Fractions?

1221
01:34:44,589 --> 01:34:48,855
- I got my test back and I got a 95.
- Of course you did.

1222
01:34:56,301 --> 01:34:59,361
- What's going on?
- Donnie, what are you doing here?

1223
01:34:59,471 --> 01:35:01,200
You belong in Florida.

1224
01:35:01,306 --> 01:35:03,672
I checked in with Annette
and she said something...

1225
01:35:03,775 --> 01:35:07,370
- You called her from Florida?
- I was up here. I had a few things to care of.

1226
01:35:07,779 --> 01:35:09,906
You got to go back. Come on.

1227
01:35:10,048 --> 01:35:12,710
What happened to him?
Is he gonna be all right?

1228
01:35:12,817 --> 01:35:14,182
Do I know?

1229
01:35:14,719 --> 01:35:19,122
They got 12 fucking diplomas on the wall,
and they can't tell you a fucking thing.

1230
01:35:19,791 --> 01:35:22,385
Forget about it.
Tommy gets out of this fucking Bellevue,

1231
01:35:22,494 --> 01:35:24,519
he's going right back to fucking up.

1232
01:35:24,629 --> 01:35:27,961
- What did he do? Did he overdose?
- That ain't the question.

1233
01:35:28,932 --> 01:35:31,127
A plastic pipe in his mouth.

1234
01:35:32,769 --> 01:35:36,967
About five million tubes.
They have a machine breathing for him.

1235
01:35:37,107 --> 01:35:40,975
Where's the fucking doctor?
You want me to go talk to this guy for you?

1236
01:35:41,111 --> 01:35:43,272
Talk to the doctor?
You gonna break his legs?

1237
01:35:43,380 --> 01:35:45,974
I'm saying, you want me to do something?
I'm here.

1238
01:35:46,116 --> 01:35:48,812
I want you to go back down to Florida.

1239
01:35:50,507 --> 01:35:52,839
You belong to Sonny now. Believe me.

1240
01:35:52,976 --> 01:35:55,137
I came here to be with you.
I want to help you out.

1241
01:35:55,278 --> 01:35:58,611
- You're my man. I'm here for you.
- I don't want you here, Donnie.

1242
01:36:00,517 --> 01:36:04,078
You and Tommy is both
peas in a fucking pod. You don't listen.

1243
01:36:04,988 --> 01:36:06,888
You got your own ideas.

1244
01:36:07,090 --> 01:36:10,991
You do what you want to do
up on your high horses. Everything's a joke.

1245
01:36:16,198 --> 01:36:18,428
You go to La Guardia and you get back.

1246
01:36:18,534 --> 01:36:21,128
- Get back to Florida. Get on a plane.
- I ain't going.

1247
01:36:21,236 --> 01:36:23,363
- Forget about it.
- Go on!

1248
01:36:26,341 --> 01:36:29,401
I'm gonna stay here with you.
You want to kick the shit out of me?

1249
01:36:29,511 --> 01:36:31,706
I'm gonna be right here. All right?

1250
01:36:45,727 --> 01:36:47,490
Twenty eight years.

1251
01:36:48,530 --> 01:36:51,158
You can read it on his birth certificate.

1252
01:36:51,266 --> 01:36:54,860
Bellevue Hospital. Now he's back, in there.

1253
01:36:55,836 --> 01:36:58,703
And I'm out here,
worried to my fucking death.

1254
01:36:59,206 --> 01:37:02,369
And he's asleep in there,
same as 28 years ago

1255
01:37:03,377 --> 01:37:05,277
with the same expression.

1256
01:37:06,981 --> 01:37:08,539
He's made no progress.

1257
01:37:09,984 --> 01:37:11,975
He ain't got no fucking respect.

1258
01:37:14,322 --> 01:37:15,687
He's my son.

1259
01:37:20,728 --> 01:37:24,357
His heart stopped like a watch.

1260
01:37:25,700 --> 01:37:28,294
That's what the doctor said.
Just like a watch.

1261
01:37:28,402 --> 01:37:30,288
They had to wind it back up.

1262
01:37:31,592 --> 01:37:33,856
Who knows? Maybe next time,

1263
01:37:36,228 --> 01:37:37,627
they can't.

1264
01:38:01,554 --> 01:38:04,580
He's gonna be all right. He'll be all right.

1265
01:38:10,129 --> 01:38:11,619
I love you, Donnie.

1266
01:38:53,672 --> 01:38:54,969
Hey, Joe.

1267
01:38:55,073 --> 01:38:56,267
What?

1268
01:38:57,208 --> 01:38:59,073
You know the U.S. Government?

1269
01:38:59,177 --> 01:39:00,166
Yeah.

1270
01:39:00,278 --> 01:39:04,475
The U.S. Government you swore an oath
and dedicated your life to?

1271
01:39:04,948 --> 01:39:06,245
Yeah. Why?

1272
01:39:07,818 --> 01:39:09,217
We got audited.

1273
01:39:34,264 --> 01:39:35,891
Hey, let's make a toast to Sonny, huh?

1274
01:39:35,999 --> 01:39:38,263
To Sonny and our new Florida business.

1275
01:39:51,747 --> 01:39:54,375
Hey, Sonny, how you doing?

1276
01:39:54,483 --> 01:39:56,917
- What's going on, Red?
- You know the boys.

1277
01:40:03,058 --> 01:40:04,650
I hear you was in Florida.

1278
01:40:04,760 --> 01:40:07,786
Yeah, it's nice down there. Take the sun.

1279
01:40:08,230 --> 01:40:09,993
You got friends down there?

1280
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:13,830
Everybody's nice down there.

1281
01:40:14,002 --> 01:40:17,062
The people, they're very friendly down there.

1282
01:40:18,173 --> 01:40:19,538
Nice color.

1283
01:40:22,644 --> 01:40:23,941
Thank you.

1284
01:40:30,384 --> 01:40:33,319
I'm not talking to the Bureau.
There is no Bureau.

1285
01:40:33,421 --> 01:40:36,584
There's a bunch of assholes
and the I.R.S. Is another bunch of assholes.

1286
01:40:36,691 --> 01:40:39,524
So what I'm asking you to do
is to place a phone call, asshole to asshole.

1287
01:40:39,627 --> 01:40:42,152
- Please calm down.
- You want me to calm down?

1288
01:40:45,733 --> 01:40:48,634
You tell this fucking auditor
that I'm coming to D.C.

1289
01:40:48,736 --> 01:40:51,418
And I'm gonna whip the shit out of him
with his calculator, you understand?

1290
01:41:03,337 --> 01:41:05,237
Let's face it, bud,
they don't audit you for...

1291
01:41:05,339 --> 01:41:06,465
Okay, I'm gonna hang up now.

1292
01:41:06,573 --> 01:41:08,473
Wait, I'm a GS-15. You can't...

1293
01:41:08,809 --> 01:41:10,003
Fucking cocksucker.

1294
01:41:13,579 --> 01:41:14,910
All right!

1295
01:41:16,816 --> 01:41:18,647
How you doing, Nicky?

1296
01:41:20,419 --> 01:41:21,784
Hey, Sonny!

1297
01:41:21,954 --> 01:41:25,048
Look at this place. It's unbelievable.

1298
01:41:25,958 --> 01:41:27,687
- Beautiful.
- I feel lucky tonight.

1299
01:41:27,794 --> 01:41:29,591
Look at it. Opening night.

1300
01:41:29,695 --> 01:41:31,959
This place is a goddamn palace,
for Christ's sake.

1301
01:41:42,041 --> 01:41:44,168
Terrific, Sonny. I love it.

1302
01:41:45,978 --> 01:41:48,503
- It's a fucking palace!
- How you doing?

1303
01:41:48,648 --> 01:41:50,912
How you doing? Having fun?

1304
01:41:54,987 --> 01:41:58,080
Let's try another one. Again.

1305
01:42:18,176 --> 01:42:19,507
I like it.

1306
01:42:19,711 --> 01:42:21,406
I like it bigtime.

1307
01:42:26,918 --> 01:42:30,863
- I need a steak, medium rare.
- Couple bowls of chili, extra hot.

1308
01:42:33,711 --> 01:42:35,906
Okay, Donnie, this is the take.

1309
01:42:36,047 --> 01:42:38,277
- Put this bag someplace safe.
- All right.

1310
01:42:38,382 --> 01:42:39,871
Chicken taco.

1311
01:42:53,463 --> 01:42:55,397
Just turn real slow.

1312
01:42:58,702 --> 01:43:00,431
Is there a problem, Officer?

1313
01:43:00,537 --> 01:43:03,836
- What's your name, boy?
- Donnie Brasco. What's yours?

1314
01:43:03,974 --> 01:43:06,943
What are all you New York guineas
doing down here?

1315
01:43:07,043 --> 01:43:08,806
Your missus invited us.

1316
01:43:13,550 --> 01:43:16,280
Gentlemen, we're running
a charity event here.

1317
01:43:16,386 --> 01:43:19,082
- We have a permit.
- You got a permit for the lion?

1318
01:43:27,730 --> 01:43:29,755
Break it up! Break it up!

1319
01:43:41,577 --> 01:43:43,636
You fucking pigs!

1320
01:43:54,957 --> 01:43:59,018
I guess you didn't ever think
of paying these guys off, did you?

1321
01:43:59,194 --> 01:44:02,493
Where the hell am I gonna get money to go
bribing cops? Nobody authorized that.

1322
01:44:27,207 --> 01:44:29,869
You know how fucking embarrassed I am?

1323
01:44:31,278 --> 01:44:33,269
The old man's people down here.

1324
01:44:34,949 --> 01:44:38,407
A year now, I got to be in my house
with the shades drawn.

1325
01:44:44,425 --> 01:44:46,450
Where's that bag?

1326
01:44:46,994 --> 01:44:49,757
They got it. They got everything.

1327
01:44:56,703 --> 01:44:58,967
That's Rusty's money.

1328
01:45:02,709 --> 01:45:04,836
- Sonny, I'm sorry...
- Shut up.

1329
01:45:05,511 --> 01:45:07,342
You shut up. Sit down.

1330
01:45:07,547 --> 01:45:09,412
Shut the fuck up.

1331
01:45:13,853 --> 01:45:16,481
Like this, I got to go back to New York.

1332
01:45:17,090 --> 01:45:19,456
Make this right with Rusty.

1333
01:45:21,060 --> 01:45:23,620
Face that cocksucker Sonny Red.

1334
01:45:23,830 --> 01:45:26,458
You know, I got to say something.

1335
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,366
Usually the cops are so fucking dumb.

1336
01:45:29,502 --> 01:45:32,766
It takes them three months
just to get wind something's going on.

1337
01:45:32,871 --> 01:45:35,305
Then they got to go get a warrant.

1338
01:45:35,407 --> 01:45:38,467
They got to go through them pictures.
What are they?

1339
01:45:38,577 --> 01:45:41,171
- Surveillance.
- They go to surveillance.

1340
01:45:42,180 --> 01:45:44,011
Three months taking pictures.

1341
01:45:44,116 --> 01:45:47,711
All this time,
how do these cops know so much?

1342
01:45:48,220 --> 01:45:50,970
- We just opened the fucking doors.
- What are you saying?

1343
01:45:51,075 --> 01:45:53,066
There's got to be a snitch here.

1344
01:46:04,655 --> 01:46:05,952
All right.

1345
01:46:06,591 --> 01:46:08,718
So there's a snitch.

1346
01:46:09,227 --> 01:46:12,025
We find him. We cut his prick off.

1347
01:46:12,130 --> 01:46:15,064
Leave it in his mouth.
Leave him on the street.

1348
01:46:16,333 --> 01:46:17,459
Okay?

1349
01:46:23,907 --> 01:46:26,501
What are you,
a silent partner all of a sudden?

1350
01:46:32,582 --> 01:46:35,574
- Get me the fuck out of here!
- Hey, knock it off in there!

1351
01:46:35,685 --> 01:46:37,880
Shut up! Fuck you!

1352
01:46:44,194 --> 01:46:46,856
Keep it up, boy,
I'll send you out of here in a box.

1353
01:46:46,963 --> 01:46:49,932
- Did you bust it up good?
- Yeah, we busted it up.

1354
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:52,834
He's out of business. You understand?

1355
01:46:52,936 --> 01:46:54,403
Yeah, I'm listening.

1356
01:46:55,105 --> 01:46:58,302
That punk is finished down here. That's it.

1357
01:46:59,341 --> 01:47:01,935
That's great. I can't believe it.

1358
01:47:02,044 --> 01:47:04,604
- All right, look, I'll talk to you later.
- Okay.

1359
01:47:04,713 --> 01:47:06,340
Give me some of that cheese
with that salami, please?

1360
01:47:06,449 --> 01:47:08,349
- He busted up the club.
- Good.

1361
01:47:08,451 --> 01:47:11,011
- Take this taste out of my mouth.
- There you go.

1362
01:47:11,120 --> 01:47:13,452
Now he has to answer for what happened.

1363
01:47:13,722 --> 01:47:15,553
You gonna send for him?

1364
01:47:16,025 --> 01:47:17,492
He sits down with us.

1365
01:47:17,593 --> 01:47:19,823
Bing-bada-boom, it's done.

1366
01:47:20,196 --> 01:47:22,630
The whole fucking crew. All of them.

1367
01:47:22,731 --> 01:47:23,959
I'll dust off the guns.

1368
01:47:54,215 --> 01:47:56,979
Napkins and tablecloths, $500 scoot.

1369
01:47:57,551 --> 01:47:59,018
$500 scoot?

1370
01:47:59,153 --> 01:48:01,280
Down in Florida, it's $500 an hour.

1371
01:48:01,388 --> 01:48:04,221
You like it down there so much,
why don't you go buy some oranges?

1372
01:48:04,325 --> 01:48:07,123
- What do you got there, Bullfrog?
- Dime on the vig.

1373
01:48:07,695 --> 01:48:10,664
I'm doing the best I can, Sonny.

1374
01:48:11,098 --> 01:48:12,395
What do you got, Nicky?

1375
01:48:12,500 --> 01:48:16,402
I got a guy boosted 30 tickets
to Chaka Khan at the Garden.

1376
01:48:18,172 --> 01:48:19,605
What about Florida?

1377
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:22,702
I thought we weren't supposed to talk
about Florida.

1378
01:48:25,607 --> 01:48:27,097
So you never got nothing going on?

1379
01:48:27,208 --> 01:48:30,609
No. Nothing ever panned out for me, Sonny.
I couldn't catch a break.

1380
01:48:30,712 --> 01:48:34,170
- You never got nothing going on?
- What did I just say?

1381
01:48:34,716 --> 01:48:36,013
Sonny.

1382
01:48:48,396 --> 01:48:50,523
Paulie, I got a truckload of razor blades.

1383
01:48:50,632 --> 01:48:52,998
What the fuck am I gonna do
with razor blades?

1384
01:48:53,101 --> 01:48:55,569
You know how many razor blades
fit in a truck?

1385
01:48:55,670 --> 01:48:58,366
I got a guy on the inside,
works in a warehouse.

1386
01:48:58,473 --> 01:49:00,304
Has the art collection of the Shah of Iran.

1387
01:49:02,410 --> 01:49:04,207
A sit-down where?

1388
01:49:05,947 --> 01:49:07,141
Yeah.

1389
01:49:15,275 --> 01:49:17,140
That was Sonny Red's guy.

1390
01:49:17,644 --> 01:49:20,112
Wants to have a sit-down in Little Italy.

1391
01:49:20,446 --> 01:49:21,879
I got sent for.

1392
01:49:25,485 --> 01:49:27,316
Donnie, come on.

1393
01:49:37,530 --> 01:49:39,293
Paulie, we'll take your car.

1394
01:49:39,532 --> 01:49:43,491
That cocksucker Sonny Red,
he rubbed my nose in Florida

1395
01:49:43,636 --> 01:49:44,967
because of a fucking rat!

1396
01:49:45,071 --> 01:49:46,402
Forget about it.

1397
01:49:46,573 --> 01:49:48,973
Donnie, you ride up front.

1398
01:49:49,809 --> 01:49:52,072
You know what to do
when you find that rat, right, Left?

1399
01:49:52,177 --> 01:49:54,145
Could be I found him already.

1400
01:50:01,053 --> 01:50:03,681
So where we headed, Sonny? Little Italy?

1401
01:50:03,822 --> 01:50:08,486
Our guy says they got a little stop
to make first. You know what I mean?

1402
01:50:49,789 --> 01:50:51,378
Let's go.

1403
01:50:59,062 --> 01:51:02,520
Where are you going? Wait in the car.

1404
01:51:55,351 --> 01:51:56,841
All right. Come on.

1405
01:51:56,986 --> 01:51:58,385
We still got to get downtown.

1406
01:51:58,487 --> 01:52:02,081
- How long is this gonna take?
- I got them in the drain in the laundry room.

1407
01:52:02,190 --> 01:52:04,522
- The.22s?
- Bruno said you want the 9mm.

1408
01:52:04,626 --> 01:52:06,617
- Meanwhile, where the fuck is he?
- Yeah.

1409
01:52:06,728 --> 01:52:10,061
In bed with some broad with more hair
on her lip than he's got on his head.

1410
01:52:10,165 --> 01:52:12,998
- He's your kid.
- Don't remind me. Come on.

1411
01:52:13,101 --> 01:52:15,695
You think that's funny?
I don't think that's so funny.

1412
01:52:15,804 --> 01:52:16,930
All right.

1413
01:52:20,942 --> 01:52:22,933
- You don't want to listen.
- I don't think that's funny.

1414
01:52:23,044 --> 01:52:27,242
- A son should respect his father, capisce?
- Answer me. You think that's funny?

1415
01:52:27,982 --> 01:52:30,869
Shit, the bulb is out. Watch your step, guys.

1416
01:52:31,072 --> 01:52:33,597
Big fucking surprise from a fucking spider.

1417
01:52:33,741 --> 01:52:36,437
Yeah, nothing like the surprise
Sonny Black is gonna get.

1418
01:52:36,544 --> 01:52:38,978
- You can say that again.
- Put one right here.

1419
01:52:39,080 --> 01:52:40,945
He'll never know what hit him.

1420
01:52:41,048 --> 01:52:43,482
- Goddamn right.
- He's never gonna know what hit him.

1421
01:52:43,584 --> 01:52:46,177
- I'll blow his brains right there.
- Jesus! No!

1422
01:53:06,473 --> 01:53:08,134
Bruno!

1423
01:53:33,232 --> 01:53:37,635
Okay, come on! Get him off!

1424
01:53:37,736 --> 01:53:39,135
- Sonny!
- Get him off of me!

1425
01:53:39,238 --> 01:53:41,103
Take my arm. Take my hand.

1426
01:53:43,175 --> 01:53:45,143
Jesus Christ.

1427
01:53:47,379 --> 01:53:50,246
Paulie, go get Donnie.

1428
01:54:09,528 --> 01:54:10,818
What's going on?

1429
01:54:16,660 --> 01:54:19,356
- Is everything all right?
- What?

1430
01:54:21,632 --> 01:54:23,293
Is everything all right?

1431
01:54:30,040 --> 01:54:31,132
Get out.

1432
01:54:58,067 --> 01:54:59,762
Get down there.

1433
01:55:01,237 --> 01:55:04,604
The meek want to inherit the earth,
they're gonna have to get in fucking line.

1434
01:55:18,554 --> 01:55:19,987
Look what I found.

1435
01:55:20,857 --> 01:55:22,586
Them or us.

1436
01:55:23,593 --> 01:55:25,527
Nicky, you got Big Trin.

1437
01:55:25,695 --> 01:55:28,664
- Trin? I'll get a hernia.
- Shut the fuck up.

1438
01:55:28,931 --> 01:55:31,161
Donnie's gonna help you.

1439
01:55:34,737 --> 01:55:36,329
Come on, Donnie.

1440
01:55:36,506 --> 01:55:38,803
Help me fillet this fat fuck.

1441
01:55:55,042 --> 01:55:57,306
All right, all right. Come on.

1442
01:55:57,745 --> 01:55:59,337
We got work to do.

1443
01:56:45,759 --> 01:56:48,489
There was a rat in Florida, Donnie.

1444
01:56:50,931 --> 01:56:52,660
Nicky wasn't a rat.

1445
01:56:53,066 --> 01:56:55,500
You don't mention his name, all right?

1446
01:56:55,735 --> 01:56:58,829
That's what we said.
We don't mention his name.

1447
01:56:59,439 --> 01:57:02,340
Yeah. Tell yourself
whatever you have to, Left.

1448
01:57:02,609 --> 01:57:04,372
I'm not telling myself.

1449
01:57:04,511 --> 01:57:07,604
- You was down there. You have eyes.
- Twenty years you know a guy.

1450
01:57:07,713 --> 01:57:11,012
You fuck him, whack him out,
just like that? Over a lounge?

1451
01:57:11,317 --> 01:57:13,842
- That's beautiful.
- The man held out.

1452
01:57:14,753 --> 01:57:16,015
He held out on a coke deal.

1453
01:57:16,121 --> 01:57:18,282
What does one thing
got to do with the other?

1454
01:57:18,390 --> 01:57:21,553
He could have got whacked out just for that,
for your information.

1455
01:57:21,660 --> 01:57:23,890
- There wasn't a rat in Florida.
- There was a rat.

1456
01:57:23,996 --> 01:57:27,727
There was not a rat in Florida.
Richie fucked up paying off the cops.

1457
01:57:28,601 --> 01:57:30,111
What do you mean Richie fucked up?

1458
01:57:30,221 --> 01:57:34,055
That's why the club got busted.
Richie didn't pay off the fucking cops.

1459
01:57:35,393 --> 01:57:37,657
Nicky didn't have anything to do with it.

1460
01:57:37,762 --> 01:57:40,788
You don't mention his name.
That's the rules.

1461
01:57:40,932 --> 01:57:43,901
- Fuck the rules.
- That's the rules, Donnie.

1462
01:57:46,972 --> 01:57:48,132
Say his name.

1463
01:57:48,672 --> 01:57:50,367
- Come on.
- Say his name.

1464
01:57:50,474 --> 01:57:52,533
Come on. Nicky.

1465
01:57:53,243 --> 01:57:54,972
Say Nicky.

1466
01:57:55,145 --> 01:57:57,909
You can't say his name
because you know that I'm fucking right.

1467
01:57:58,015 --> 01:57:59,949
Say it! Say Nicky!

1468
01:58:01,352 --> 01:58:03,115
Say his fucking name!

1469
01:58:03,387 --> 01:58:07,790
Nicky was a rat because
Sonny Black says he was a rat.

1470
01:58:12,029 --> 01:58:13,690
Who the fuck am I?

1471
01:58:16,367 --> 01:58:18,358
Who am I?

1472
01:58:21,238 --> 01:58:23,672
I'm a spoke on a wheel.

1473
01:58:24,742 --> 01:58:28,178
And so was he, and so are you.

1474
01:58:32,048 --> 01:58:34,312
Quit riding the fucking brake.

1475
01:58:57,073 --> 01:58:59,268
You the boss. You the boss, Boss.

1476
01:59:00,243 --> 01:59:02,768
- He looks good, huh?
- Sonny Black.

1477
01:59:09,084 --> 01:59:12,097
Congratulations, Sonny!

1478
01:59:12,274 --> 01:59:13,434
Boss!

1479
01:59:16,878 --> 01:59:20,439
- Sonny. Congratulations, Sonny.
- Congratulations.

1480
01:59:30,291 --> 01:59:32,816
- Oh, God!
- No, everything's okay, Maggie.

1481
01:59:33,828 --> 01:59:37,594
Yeah? If everything's okay,
what are you doing here?

1482
01:59:37,699 --> 01:59:40,065
Mind if we come inside, Mrs. Pistone?

1483
01:59:40,268 --> 01:59:42,168
I'm not sure. That depends.

1484
01:59:42,603 --> 01:59:44,798
At that point, he became hysterical.

1485
01:59:45,006 --> 01:59:47,804
As if the Bureau were responsible
for this audit.

1486
01:59:47,909 --> 01:59:51,140
- Whereas, well, self-evidently...
- Did you ever think of giving him a raise?

1487
01:59:51,245 --> 01:59:53,679
The only way to give him a raise
would be to upgrade him.

1488
01:59:53,781 --> 01:59:54,941
Yeah.

1489
01:59:55,116 --> 01:59:57,744
GS-14 is a supervisor, Maggie.

1490
01:59:58,351 --> 01:59:59,841
So he's a supervisor.

1491
02:00:01,088 --> 02:00:04,455
But he's undercover.
He's not supervising anyone.

1492
02:00:04,558 --> 02:00:07,152
The point is,
that's the last time we heard from him.

1493
02:00:07,260 --> 02:00:10,593
Standard procedure is that
he is to check in with us every day.

1494
02:00:10,697 --> 02:00:13,461
Maybe he might miss a day or two
here and there, but...

1495
02:00:13,567 --> 02:00:16,365
- It was three weeks ago.
- I want you to tell me

1496
02:00:16,737 --> 02:00:18,637
where my husband is.

1497
02:00:21,575 --> 02:00:23,634
I demand that
you tell me where my husband is!

1498
02:00:23,744 --> 02:00:26,474
- We can't tell you because we don't know.
- If he gets in touch with you,

1499
02:00:26,580 --> 02:00:29,174
you have got to try to talk sense into him.

1500
02:00:29,282 --> 02:00:32,080
Mrs. Pistone, please help us here.

1501
02:00:32,219 --> 02:00:34,414
- You want me to help you out?
- Yes.

1502
02:00:34,988 --> 02:00:39,084
You want me to help out the FBI
that used my husband and sucked him dry,

1503
02:00:39,226 --> 02:00:41,853
so that a bunch of supervisors
could become SACs

1504
02:00:41,961 --> 02:00:45,089
and prosecutors could become judges
and assholes like you

1505
02:00:45,431 --> 02:00:48,195
could get promoted to GS-16?

1506
02:00:48,434 --> 02:00:50,684
Maggie, come on. You don't mean that.

1507
02:00:52,891 --> 02:00:55,451
Let me tell you something.
I hope he crossed over.

1508
02:00:55,560 --> 02:00:59,724
Mrs. Pistone, there is a war going on
in the Mafia family where Joe is undercover.

1509
02:00:59,831 --> 02:01:02,425
Three leaders of a rival faction
have been murdered.

1510
02:01:02,534 --> 02:01:05,401
He's right in the line of fire.
Not because he's one of us,

1511
02:01:05,504 --> 02:01:06,630
because he's one of them.

1512
02:01:06,738 --> 02:01:10,674
Who he's with and who he's close to,
they're all the top dogs now.

1513
02:01:12,844 --> 02:01:14,971
It's just not a problem we anticipated.

1514
02:01:15,080 --> 02:01:16,877
We have got to pull him out.

1515
02:01:17,015 --> 02:01:20,815
You have got to talk to him.
He'll listen to you.

1516
02:01:21,186 --> 02:01:22,346
You think so?

1517
02:01:26,390 --> 02:01:28,324
He was here a week ago.

1518
02:01:30,694 --> 02:01:33,527
He snuck into the house after I was asleep.

1519
02:01:35,900 --> 02:01:39,131
And he didn't even wake me up,
didn't even say hello to me.

1520
02:01:43,874 --> 02:01:46,172
He came to get his sport coat.

1521
02:02:01,058 --> 02:02:03,891
- Let's take a walk.
- All right.

1522
02:02:07,932 --> 02:02:09,694
Left, what are we doing?

1523
02:02:09,799 --> 02:02:13,064
We're gonna walk and talk.
We got too many eyes around here.

1524
02:02:16,472 --> 02:02:20,738
Here it is, Donnie.
Sonny Red's kid, Bruno. He's disappeared.

1525
02:02:21,110 --> 02:02:24,568
Now, as long as he's on the loose,

1526
02:02:24,681 --> 02:02:26,308
ain't none of us safe.

1527
02:02:26,950 --> 02:02:28,747
- Right?
- Yeah.

1528
02:02:28,852 --> 02:02:31,272
You got no idea where the guy is?

1529
02:02:31,473 --> 02:02:35,500
He's got a nickel-a-day coke habit.
He's gonna turn up somewhere.

1530
02:02:36,512 --> 02:02:40,312
Anyway, we got the contract.

1531
02:02:44,119 --> 02:02:46,610
Now, this thing gets done right,

1532
02:02:46,722 --> 02:02:50,351
when the books open up,
I'm proposing you for membership.

1533
02:02:50,860 --> 02:02:53,987
- You know what that means?
- Yeah.

1534
02:02:54,128 --> 02:02:55,823
Yeah? What?

1535
02:02:55,964 --> 02:03:00,162
- It means I can't fuck it up.
- You read my mind.

1536
02:03:01,069 --> 02:03:05,301
- You read my mind. You can't fuck it up.
- No, I won't fuck it up.

1537
02:03:10,745 --> 02:03:12,872
You're gonna be a made guy, Donnie.

1538
02:03:13,181 --> 02:03:14,375
Capisce?

1539
02:03:15,450 --> 02:03:17,714
Yeah. All right.

1540
02:03:18,453 --> 02:03:20,080
Yeah. All right.

1541
02:03:20,788 --> 02:03:23,689
Come on. Let's go back inside!

1542
02:03:27,762 --> 02:03:29,855
- Left.
- Yeah, what?

1543
02:03:33,134 --> 02:03:35,658
What? I'm freezing here!

1544
02:03:39,439 --> 02:03:42,237
You know that boat you used to have,
that Bertram?

1545
02:03:43,377 --> 02:03:45,208
- Boat? What about it?
- Yeah, boat.

1546
02:03:45,312 --> 02:03:49,544
How much is it? A boat like that?
How much? What do you think?

1547
02:03:50,717 --> 02:03:53,686
You could get a sports fisherman
for maybe 300, used.

1548
02:03:53,787 --> 02:03:56,119
Why are you asking me
about boats, Donnie?

1549
02:03:56,223 --> 02:03:58,350
I was just wondering.
I was curious, you know.

1550
02:03:58,458 --> 02:04:00,153
- You're curious about boats?
- Yeah.

1551
02:04:00,260 --> 02:04:02,421
It's 10 degrees out here. I'm freezing.

1552
02:04:02,529 --> 02:04:05,521
You're asking me about boats,
after what we just said?

1553
02:04:05,832 --> 02:04:08,494
You losing your marbles on me or what?

1554
02:04:08,635 --> 02:04:11,419
- No, I'm all right.
- So don't ask questions like that.

1555
02:04:11,524 --> 02:04:13,651
- That's crazy, okay?
- Yeah.

1556
02:04:13,793 --> 02:04:17,320
You hit this cocksucker,
and you leave him in the street. Come on.

1557
02:05:20,386 --> 02:05:23,446
- You want to tell me what's going on?
- Nothing. Go back to bed.

1558
02:05:23,556 --> 02:05:26,582
I'm looking for something, all right?
I'll be right in.

1559
02:05:27,360 --> 02:05:29,988
That's not gonna work anymore.

1560
02:05:32,298 --> 02:05:33,322
Where is it?

1561
02:05:33,432 --> 02:05:35,764
There's $300,000 in that bag.

1562
02:05:37,403 --> 02:05:40,372
How do you know what's in that bag?

1563
02:05:41,140 --> 02:05:42,232
I counted it.

1564
02:05:42,341 --> 02:05:43,365
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1565
02:05:43,476 --> 02:05:45,102
- You counted it?
- Yeah.

1566
02:05:45,243 --> 02:05:48,041
What do you mean, you counted it?
It's none of your business.

1567
02:05:48,146 --> 02:05:51,568
Not my business? It's in my house.
Who'd ever believe it wasn't my business?

1568
02:05:51,669 --> 02:05:53,637
I want that fucking bag, Maggie.

1569
02:05:53,771 --> 02:05:57,935
FBI men do not walk around
with $300,000 in a bag.

1570
02:05:58,609 --> 02:06:02,010
- Joe, you could go to jail for this.
- Shut the fuck up. Nobody's going to jail.

1571
02:06:02,113 --> 02:06:04,581
Did you think about your children
for a second?

1572
02:06:04,682 --> 02:06:07,242
- You have no idea what you're talking about.
- I don't?

1573
02:06:07,351 --> 02:06:10,115
- The bag belongs to somebody else.
- Does it? Who?

1574
02:06:10,421 --> 02:06:13,151
- Whose bag is it, Joe?
- One of my best... Just some fucked-up guy.

1575
02:06:13,257 --> 02:06:17,284
- A fucked-up guy needs $300,000?
- Yeah, right. Where's the goddamn bag?

1576
02:06:19,163 --> 02:06:21,825
You're becoming like them, you know that?

1577
02:07:00,403 --> 02:07:03,736
Did you ever once ask yourself
how I make it through my days?

1578
02:07:04,541 --> 02:07:06,702
I pretend I'm a widow

1579
02:07:07,077 --> 02:07:10,171
with medals and scrapbooks and memories.

1580
02:07:12,448 --> 02:07:14,006
I pretend you're dead.

1581
02:07:14,416 --> 02:07:16,941
That's how my life makes sense to me.

1582
02:07:17,953 --> 02:07:20,080
Just go away. Stay away.

1583
02:07:35,757 --> 02:07:38,954
God, why do you hate me
when I love you so much?

1584
02:07:44,933 --> 02:07:46,764
You think I hate you?

1585
02:07:47,936 --> 02:07:49,699
I don't hate you.

1586
02:07:56,143 --> 02:07:58,134
This job is eating me alive.

1587
02:07:59,079 --> 02:08:00,808
I can't breathe anymore.

1588
02:08:04,351 --> 02:08:06,683
And if I come out, this guy Lefty dies.

1589
02:08:09,389 --> 02:08:12,586
They're gonna kill him,
because he vouched for me,

1590
02:08:12,693 --> 02:08:14,456
because he stood up for me.

1591
02:08:16,130 --> 02:08:17,961
I live with that every day.

1592
02:08:20,200 --> 02:08:23,294
That's the same thing as if I put the bullet
in his head myself, you understand?

1593
02:08:26,006 --> 02:08:28,634
I spent all these years
trying to be the good guy.

1594
02:08:28,742 --> 02:08:31,336
You know, the man in the white fucking hat.

1595
02:08:32,212 --> 02:08:33,440
For what?

1596
02:08:36,416 --> 02:08:37,610
For nothing.

1597
02:08:42,822 --> 02:08:45,791
I'm not becoming like them, Maggie.
I am them.

1598
02:09:24,448 --> 02:09:26,382
Left? Donnie.

1599
02:09:26,484 --> 02:09:28,179
Donnie? Where you been?

1600
02:09:28,286 --> 02:09:30,117
Yeah, look...

1601
02:09:30,588 --> 02:09:33,284
- I gotta see you.
- You're right, you gotta see me.

1602
02:09:33,391 --> 02:09:35,382
- We found Sonny Red's kid.
- Bruno?

1603
02:09:35,493 --> 02:09:38,223
Yeah, he's on a boat on Staten Island.

1604
02:09:38,329 --> 02:09:40,889
- I'll pick you up.
- We don't have time, Donnie.

1605
02:09:40,998 --> 02:09:42,295
- You meet me there.
- Okay.

1606
02:10:06,456 --> 02:10:09,357
Bruno's here. He's down the end of the pier.

1607
02:10:10,860 --> 02:10:13,795
We'll wait here a minute
while he has his drink.

1608
02:10:14,564 --> 02:10:16,794
Let him get a little sleepy.

1609
02:10:18,134 --> 02:10:21,592
- I'm getting a little sleepy myself.
- How's his boat?

1610
02:10:22,305 --> 02:10:24,102
- The boat?
- Yeah.

1611
02:10:24,908 --> 02:10:26,205
Nice.

1612
02:10:27,177 --> 02:10:31,045
Forget about it. One thing I know is boats.

1613
02:10:31,615 --> 02:10:35,415
I'd like to pop him, throw him in the water,
take the fucking boat.

1614
02:10:37,787 --> 02:10:42,315
Remember you said a couple of times
how if you had that Bertram again,

1615
02:10:43,026 --> 02:10:46,894
you'd drive down to the pier with Annette
and just go?

1616
02:10:47,097 --> 02:10:50,779
Remember you said that? North, south,
east, west, nobody'd ever find you.

1617
02:10:50,885 --> 02:10:54,082
That was before.
Don't remind me about that now.

1618
02:10:54,222 --> 02:10:57,248
- Yeah, but I'm just saying...
- I don't want to think about that.

1619
02:10:57,359 --> 02:10:58,849
Did you mean it?

1620
02:10:59,961 --> 02:11:01,087
Mean it?

1621
02:11:01,463 --> 02:11:04,125
Who am I? Rockefeller?
I'm gonna go buy a boat?

1622
02:11:04,633 --> 02:11:07,067
- I'm saying, what if, Left?
- What if.

1623
02:11:07,202 --> 02:11:08,499
What if...

1624
02:11:09,037 --> 02:11:13,167
I mean, I got a couple of things
going on the side. A couple of jewel things.

1625
02:11:14,409 --> 02:11:17,207
Maybe I could get that kind of money
for you.

1626
02:11:20,148 --> 02:11:22,241
You're gonna find money
for me to get a boat?

1627
02:11:22,350 --> 02:11:24,716
- Maybe.
- Yeah?

1628
02:11:25,620 --> 02:11:27,884
That would be real generous of you, Donnie.

1629
02:11:27,989 --> 02:11:32,152
What if I could hand you
a bagful of money right now?

1630
02:11:33,427 --> 02:11:35,327
You know what I'm saying?

1631
02:11:37,298 --> 02:11:39,391
You could leave this life.

1632
02:11:39,900 --> 02:11:41,959
You said it yourself, if you don't move up,

1633
02:11:42,069 --> 02:11:44,037
every day you're looking
over your shoulder.

1634
02:11:44,138 --> 02:11:45,503
You don't know what's gonna happen.

1635
02:11:45,606 --> 02:11:47,233
- Donnie, listen to me.
- No more bullshit.

1636
02:11:47,341 --> 02:11:49,036
Get out of this life is what I'm saying, Left.

1637
02:11:49,143 --> 02:11:51,668
- I'm gonna show you something, Donnie.
- What?

1638
02:11:51,779 --> 02:11:54,612
I want you to look at it very carefully.

1639
02:11:55,849 --> 02:11:59,307
And then I want you to think very carefully

1640
02:12:00,654 --> 02:12:02,986
about what you say to me.

1641
02:12:06,994 --> 02:12:09,292
That's a Federal boat, Donnie.

1642
02:12:19,605 --> 02:12:22,199
- I really don't think that's the same boat...
- That's the same boat.

1643
02:12:22,308 --> 02:12:24,936
It's got the name on it, The Left Hand.

1644
02:12:25,044 --> 02:12:27,035
It's like my name.

1645
02:12:28,414 --> 02:12:30,664
That's that Abscam boat.

1646
02:12:32,738 --> 02:12:35,332
You think I knew that was a Federal boat?

1647
02:12:36,909 --> 02:12:39,173
You think I'm a fucking rat?

1648
02:12:39,545 --> 02:12:43,037
How many times I have you
into my own house?

1649
02:12:45,551 --> 02:12:47,280
Twice a week, at least. Why?

1650
02:12:47,386 --> 02:12:49,786
There it is, "At least."

1651
02:12:51,790 --> 02:12:53,553
- I cook for you.
- Yeah.

1652
02:12:54,793 --> 02:12:57,125
If ever I had any money, I'd give you.

1653
02:12:57,962 --> 02:13:00,863
I never had any money. But if ever I had...

1654
02:13:00,965 --> 02:13:04,731
$100 in my pocket, I gave you $50, right?

1655
02:13:06,003 --> 02:13:08,528
- Yeah, you did.
- If you're a rat...

1656
02:13:19,517 --> 02:13:23,954
If you're a rat, then I'm the biggest
fucking mutt in the history of the Mafia.

1657
02:13:24,756 --> 02:13:27,554
Even if this thing is a Federal boat, Left,

1658
02:13:29,160 --> 02:13:32,561
they scam all these other people.
They didn't scam us.

1659
02:13:32,663 --> 02:13:34,460
You know what I'm saying?

1660
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,468
We went. We had a great party.
We walked away from it.

1661
02:13:41,905 --> 02:13:45,136
How do you know
that we walked away from it?

1662
02:13:45,308 --> 02:13:47,333
We're sitting here, right?

1663
02:13:48,078 --> 02:13:51,138
So they tried to outsmart us,
but we outsmarted them.

1664
02:13:52,816 --> 02:13:54,716
We beat the agents.

1665
02:13:58,655 --> 02:14:00,350
You gotta believe me.

1666
02:14:11,154 --> 02:14:12,314
Okay.

1667
02:14:15,425 --> 02:14:17,120
Let's go do this work.

1668
02:14:18,394 --> 02:14:20,362
Get this over with.

1669
02:14:26,635 --> 02:14:28,967
Two in back of the ear.
Like pushing a button.

1670
02:14:29,070 --> 02:14:30,594
Bing, bing. That's it.

1671
02:14:30,739 --> 02:14:32,434
- Yeah.
- Don't freeze up.

1672
02:14:33,074 --> 02:14:34,701
- You gonna freeze up?
- No.

1673
02:14:34,810 --> 02:14:37,506
- A lot of guys freeze up.
- I'll be all right.

1674
02:14:37,612 --> 02:14:40,638
Did I say you was a rat?
I can't believe you brought that up.

1675
02:14:40,749 --> 02:14:42,512
Come on. Forget about it, Left.

1676
02:14:42,617 --> 02:14:44,881
I never said you was a rat.

1677
02:14:45,120 --> 02:14:46,678
I'm your best friend.

1678
02:14:48,957 --> 02:14:51,084
Come on. Let's go do this thing.

1679
02:15:31,999 --> 02:15:34,365
Come on, Donnie. Come on.

1680
02:15:35,903 --> 02:15:37,803
Gotta do it, Don.

1681
02:15:39,773 --> 02:15:41,400
Come on, Don.

1682
02:15:42,009 --> 02:15:43,067
Now!

1683
02:15:44,011 --> 02:15:45,740
Come on.

1684
02:15:47,181 --> 02:15:49,662
FBI! Freeze!

1685
02:15:50,937 --> 02:15:52,028
Shit!

1686
02:15:56,275 --> 02:15:59,244
Don't say nothing, Donnie.
Don't say nothing to them.

1687
02:16:02,248 --> 02:16:04,113
Don't tell them nothing, Donnie!

1688
02:16:04,216 --> 02:16:05,911
Donnie, don't say nothing!

1689
02:16:06,051 --> 02:16:09,748
- It's over.
- Fuck you, it's not over. I'm not coming out.

1690
02:16:09,889 --> 02:16:13,552
There'll be a mouthpiece there in 24 hours!
Donnie, you're all right!

1691
02:16:13,659 --> 02:16:15,422
- Shit!
- It's over, man!

1692
02:16:15,561 --> 02:16:17,927
Don't say nothing to them, Donnie!

1693
02:16:18,163 --> 02:16:20,063
It's over, Joe.

1694
02:17:02,206 --> 02:17:06,267
You've known this guy as Donnie Brasco.
That's not his real name.

1695
02:17:08,379 --> 02:17:11,439
Truth is, he's been an FBI agent all along.

1696
02:17:14,719 --> 02:17:18,051
You can contact me here if you want to talk.

1697
02:18:08,123 --> 02:18:10,523
Can you believe those fucking guys?

1698
02:18:11,426 --> 02:18:13,519
There's no way Donnie's an agent.

1699
02:18:15,097 --> 02:18:17,258
It's a nice fucking bluff, huh?

1700
02:18:17,899 --> 02:18:20,732
That boat was a set-up.
They set the boat up.

1701
02:18:21,103 --> 02:18:23,264
See? Then we think Donnie's a rat.

1702
02:18:28,510 --> 02:18:30,910
Almost had me going,

1703
02:18:31,913 --> 02:18:33,608
if you didn't know Donnie.

1704
02:18:36,084 --> 02:18:38,245
Right, if I didn't know Donnie.

1705
02:19:01,342 --> 02:19:03,708
Hyenas kill many young cheetahs

1706
02:19:03,844 --> 02:19:07,678
and more than one could overpower
the mother and turn on the cubs.

1707
02:19:19,346 --> 02:19:20,472
Yeah?

1708
02:19:22,349 --> 02:19:24,146
Yeah. All right.

1709
02:19:25,552 --> 02:19:27,019
All right. Okay.

1710
02:19:35,061 --> 02:19:37,154
Was that for me?

1711
02:19:37,863 --> 02:19:41,822
No. It was a guy I got to go see.

1712
02:19:42,268 --> 02:19:45,328
- So late?
- What am I gonna do?

1713
02:19:47,206 --> 02:19:48,833
Who knows with these people?

1714
02:19:48,941 --> 02:19:50,875
- Honey, don't wait up for me tonight.
- No?

1715
02:19:50,976 --> 02:19:53,001
I don't know how long I'm gonna be.

1716
02:19:53,112 --> 02:19:54,943
And listen to me.

1717
02:20:00,319 --> 02:20:02,219
If Donnie calls

1718
02:20:03,322 --> 02:20:04,880
tell him

1719
02:20:10,229 --> 02:20:12,389
if it was going to be anyone,

1720
02:20:13,765 --> 02:20:16,757
I'm glad it was him, all right?

1721
02:20:17,135 --> 02:20:19,103
Look how beautiful you look.

1722
02:20:19,637 --> 02:20:21,798
- Goodbye.
- Bye, Ben.

1723
02:22:09,293 --> 02:22:11,124
Excuse me, Mrs. Pistone.

1724
02:22:11,929 --> 02:22:13,556
Have a seat.

1725
02:22:18,468 --> 02:22:21,664
- "To Special Agent Joseph..."
- Thirty seconds, sir.

1726
02:22:22,371 --> 02:22:26,967
"Joseph D. Pistone, in grateful recognition
for meritorious service."

1727
02:22:27,143 --> 02:22:31,759
Allow me to present you with this medal
and this check for $500.

1728
02:22:31,867 --> 02:22:33,300
Hold the check up.

1729
02:22:34,369 --> 02:22:37,634
- Congratulations again, son.
- Congratulations, Joe.

1730
02:22:38,941 --> 02:22:41,967
- Ma'am, take good care of him.
- I will.

1731
02:22:42,344 --> 02:22:43,811
Mrs. Pistone.

1732
02:23:22,850 --> 02:23:24,408
It's over.

1733
02:23:26,120 --> 02:23:28,179
Come on, honey. Come home.
