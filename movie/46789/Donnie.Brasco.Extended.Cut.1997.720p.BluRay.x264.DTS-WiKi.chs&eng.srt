You're not saying things
that mean anything.
别瞎感觉了，你说什么？

00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,939
It's not even a debate.
It's a better automobile!
你还要说什么？那确是辆好车

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,407
Ain't no way you can say to me
a Lincoln is better than a Cadillac.
林肯车怎会好过卡迪拉克？

9
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,541
- A Lincoln is better. It's a better automobile.
- Forget about it.
林肯确实更好,林肯车它就是好嘛
算了吧

00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:39,448
A Cadillac's got more acceleration.
It's got more power.

- You just said that.
- Bingo.
你就知道那一点!

14
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,449
- What?
- You just said. "More power."
什么？
你就只会说"动力更好".

15
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,289
- You're starting to repeat yourself.
- I said that?
你在开始重复你自己的话了.
我那样说的吗?

16
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:52,125

A Mercedes?
梅塞德斯?

19
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:59,038
A Lincoln's like driving a fucking water bed.
For Christ's sakes.
开林肯就像在水床上一样.

20
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:02,437
- A Mercedes.
- Yeah. It's a good car.
-奔驰.
-是辆好车.

Undisputable. The Lincoln is longer.
我告诉你一件事,朋友.
无可置疑的,林肯更长.

22

Longer like my dick is longer?
它更长吗?长在哪里?

23
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,519
What do you mean? Yeah. Volkswagen.
什么意思?对,大众.

24
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:22,561
Longer. Like longer.
Like in inches it's longer.
更长,像更长的
像英寸一样更长.

25
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:24,220
- You don't make no fucking sense.
- It's a longer car.
- 你别没该死的感觉
- 它是一辆更长的车

Two fucking cars. Right?
This is a car. This is a car. Right?
两辆他妈的小车.好吧?
这是一辆小车,这是一辆小车.对吗?

27
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,024
Right here. Okay?
在这里.好不?

28
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:32,264
All things being equal.
The one's longer gonna get there first.
所有的事都是平等的.
那更长的首先达到目的.

29
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:33,862
You don't have to be fucking Einstein
to understand this.
你不必上爱因斯坦来明白这个.

30
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:35,702
You know what happens when you get there. Don't you?
你知道当你达到目的时候会发生什么?你不知道吗?

31
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:38,003
- No.
- You're still driving a fucking Lincoln.
- 不.
- 你还是去开那该死的林肯去.

32
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,547
I'll show you a fucking picture.
Two cars. The one's longer gets there first.
我给你看一张照片.
两辆车,一辆更长的先达到目的.

33
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:43,946
That's a scientific fact. It's a longer car.
这是客观事实.这辆更长.

34
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,950
- Can I ask you guys something?
- What?
- 我能问你这家伙一些事吗?

Are you guys. You know. Wise guys?

Wise guys? What are wise guys?

37
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:56,659
- You know...
- What makes you think we're wise guys?

39
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:00,199

The guy by the bar with the mustache.
吧台那边，留小胡子的

44

噢，那是东尼，珠宝商.

不是四眼基利，是从昆士来的

47
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:28,083

- 你说他很聪明吗？
- 他是跑腿的

48
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:32,992
Connected? If I had a thing to lay off.
He could lay it off for me?
跑腿？对,我想脱身.
他能行吗？

49
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:36,101
- You got something you gotta lay off?
- Ain't the question.
- 你出什么事了？，

我只不过说说而已.
他能帮我脱手,是那样吧.

piece of ass." "Forget about it."
象“拉古是个大傻瓜，你就说得了吧

有时它跟说见鬼去吧差不多

979

and then we all get rich.
等我们有钱了，你想怎样呢？

Are we heading
back to New York pretty soon?
等我们有钱了，你想怎样呢？

1094
01:24:18,308 --> 01:24:21,835
Not you. I want you to represent me
down here, Donnie.
你就不用了，我要你在这里发展

1095
01:24:22,479 --> 01:24:25,004
I want you to be my man in Florida.

Get that club going. You know, Kings Court.
去掌管那酒吧，就是你知道的“王朝”

你在想我怎会知道的，是吗？

in New York.
但我在纽约还有些事要处理

- 我喜欢跟大家呆在一起

01:24:59,216 --> 01:25:01,684
He looked after me when I was in the can.

Yeah, I know he does.
我知道的

1108
01:25:14,364 --> 01:25:17,561
The problem is that you think that he's helping you,

01:25:17,701 --> 01:25:19,532
but he's hurting you.

01:25:53,470 --> 01:25:55,597
Mr. Trafficante's leaving.
桑托要走了

- I will.
- 替我照顾好一点，

1123
01:26:26,336 --> 01:26:29,066
Snowed in. Can you believe him?
下雪了，你不信？

1124

Right. His daughter's First Communion,
and he gets stuck at an airport.
女儿的第一次圣餐礼他都不回家

I'm going upstairs.

1131
01:27:10,947 --> 01:27:12,574
God damn it, Joe.

The number you have dialed has been changed.

Christ, Joe, what are we going to do?
正向这边来了，怎么办？

1138
01:28:15,245 --> 01:28:17,805
Why don't you just shut the fuck up?
I'll take care of it.
你干嘛不闭嘴？我会搞定的

1139
01:28:23,887 --> 01:28:25,878
Anything goes wrong down there,
有任何事，

1140
01:28:25,989 --> 01:28:29,584
you have their people call your people
in New York, understand?
让他们找纽约人说

Keep your mouth shut.
别出声！他在执行任务

Listen to me.

Get on the phone.
Get me on the next flight back. Understand?
打个电话，我乘下班飞机回来，明白？

1154
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:13,298
Don't call me Joe again.
I'll cut your fucking throat, understand?
再叫我乔我会卡断你的脖子，明白吗？

1155
01:29:13,403 --> 01:29:15,132
You piece of shit.
这个杂种！

1156
01:29:49,139 --> 01:29:52,108
- Daddy?
- Hi, baby.

01:31:07,217 --> 01:31:10,880
without announcing when, why, or where
he's been for the last three months.

not telling your husband is pretty normal.
却不告诉丈夫也是正常的吗？

1170

- 我不在，你也不在
- 好了，我知道是怎么回事了

不，现在我知道你的感受，我会告诉你的，感觉好极了

Now I do know how it feels
to be so in control.

- 你想怎样就怎样吧，

Please, Joe, just listen.
请你听着乔，你有些常见的病症

1176
01:31:48,491 --> 01:31:51,688
Otherwise you just play out
the old pathology.

1177
01:31:53,797 --> 01:31:55,924
Maggie, you were saying Joe leaves.
玛吉，你说乔离开你了

1178

The man I married was a college man.
听到了吗？我嫁了个傻瓜

1185
01:32:31,067 --> 01:32:35,128
Being the distancer
forces Maggie into the role of the pursuer.
依我看这是长时间分居

1186
01:32:35,572 --> 01:32:38,097
This gives you a feeling of power.

I'm not gonna do it anymore.
我能把你怎样？

1191
01:32:51,621 --> 01:32:53,179
I really hope that you can help her out
我真希望你能帮我

1192
01:32:53,289 --> 01:32:55,314

You can see that.
明明是她有问题，她才需要治疗

1193
01:32:55,425 --> 01:32:58,258
Obviously, I'm the sick one.

1194
01:32:58,928 --> 01:33:00,691
- You.

你们要在自己的日期暗示对方

1198
01:33:13,777 --> 01:33:15,574
"Rub my back," or

1199
01:33:16,379 --> 01:33:19,542
"I have a problem with the kids.
Could you help me out?"
我还要跟孩子谈谈，能协助我吗？

1200
01:33:21,050 --> 01:33:23,348
You sit around in your safe little fucking house
你知什么？呆在家有什么不好？

1201
01:33:23,453 --> 01:33:27,389
with your safe little fucking station wagon,
and your safe little friends.
为了你和孩子的安全专门为你和孩子买了这车

1202
01:33:27,490 --> 01:33:29,981
You dream up the next $100 head fuck.
那钱是一百一百从天而降吗？

1203
01:33:30,126 --> 01:33:33,562

1204
01:33:33,696 --> 01:33:36,995
- Just get in the fucking car.
- Do you know that?
- 快坐上去吧，
- 你知道吗？嗯？

1205
01:33:38,034 --> 01:33:40,594
You know what my intimacy request is
for that guy?
知道我和他是怎么回事吗？

1206
01:33:40,703 --> 01:33:41,897
It's very intimate.
非常密切

1207
01:33:42,005 --> 01:33:44,735
He can take the bill he's gonna send me
and shove it up his ass.
他能勒紧肚子替我买单

1208
01:33:44,841 --> 01:33:46,741
You want to know why we went to him?
你知道我们干嘛看医生吗？

1209
01:33:46,843 --> 01:33:50,404
I was hoping he could come up with
one good reason for me not to leave you

你想…你想离开我，玛吉？你休想离开我

1213
01:34:09,799 --> 01:34:11,232
- Hello.
- Hey, Annette.
－喂
－喂，安莉塔，

1214
01:34:11,367 --> 01:34:13,062
Donnie.
东尼！

1215

they can't.
他的灵魂已经飞走

Say his fucking name!

1468
01:58:03,665 --> 01:58:08,068
Nicky was a rat because
Sonny Black says he was a rat.
里基是奸细是因为黑桑说他是

1469
01:58:12,307 --> 01:58:13,968

1470

Who am I?
我是谁？我就像…

1471
01:58:21,516 --> 01:58:23,950
I'm a spoke on a wheel.
轮子的刹车片

1472
01:58:25,020 --> 01:58:28,456
And so was he, and so are you.
你和他脚下的

1473

Quit riding the fucking brake.

1474
01:58:57,352 --> 01:58:59,547
You the boss. You the boss, Boss.
老板！老板！

1475
01:59:00,522 --> 01:59:03,047
- He looks good, huh?
- Sonny Black.

- No, everything's okay, Maggie.
天哪，没事，玛吉

1480
01:59:34,122 --> 01:59:37,888
Yeah? If everything's okay,
what are you doing here?
是吗？没事你们来干什么？

1481
01:59:37,993 --> 01:59:40,359
Mind if we come inside, Mrs. Pistone?
进去谈好吗，皮斯顿太太？

1482
01:59:40,562 --> 01:59:42,462
I'm not sure. That depends.
我不相信，看情况

1483
01:59:42,897 --> 01:59:45,092
At that point, he became hysterical.
在那点上，他变得歇斯底里了

1484
01:59:45,300 --> 01:59:48,098
As if the Bureau were responsible
for this audit.
作为局里有义务审计

1485
01:59:48,203 --> 01:59:51,434
- Whereas, well, self-evidently...
- Did you ever think of giving him a raise?

1486
01:59:51,539 --> 01:59:53,973
The only way to give him a raise
would be to upgrade him.

1487
01:59:54,075 --> 01:59:55,235
Yeah.
是

1488
01:59:55,410 --> 01:59:58,038
GS-14 is a supervisor, Maggie.
GS-14是监督人，玛姬

1489
01:59:58,646 --> 02:00:00,136
So he's a supervisor.
那么，他是监督人了。

1490
02:00:01,383 --> 02:00:04,750
But he's undercover.
He's not supervising anyone.
但是他是从事间谍工作，他不能作监督人

1491
02:00:04,853 --> 02:00:07,447
The point is,
that's the last time we heard from him.
这是指那是我们最后一次听说他的情况

1492
02:00:07,555 --> 02:00:10,888
Standard procedure is that
he is to check in with us every day.
标准程序是他每天要向我们汇报

1493
02:00:10,992 --> 02:00:13,756
Maybe he might miss a day or two
here and there, but...
若是一两天…

1494
02:00:13,862 --> 02:00:16,660
- It was three weeks ago.
- I want you to tell me
- 但这已经是三个星期了
- 你们要告诉我

1495
02:00:17,032 --> 02:00:18,932
where my husband is.

I demand that you tell me where my husband is!
我有权要你们告诉我

1497
02:00:24,039 --> 02:00:26,769
- We can't tell you because we don't know.
- If he gets in touch with you,
- 我们也没办法问答你
- 若他跟你联系，

1498
02:00:26,875 --> 02:00:29,469
you have got to try to talk sense into him.
请你跟他讲明

1499
02:00:29,577 --> 02:00:32,375
Mrs. Pistone, please help us here.
皮斯太太，请你协助我们

1500
02:00:32,514 --> 02:00:34,709
- You want me to help you out?
- Yes.
- 你要我协助你们？
- 是的

1501
02:00:35,283 --> 02:00:39,379
You want me to help out the FBI
that used my husband and sucked him dry,
要我帮助抢走我丈夫的FBI？

1502
02:00:39,521 --> 02:00:42,149
so that a bunch of supervisors
could become SACs
他是死是活，你们关心过吗？

1503
02:00:42,257 --> 02:00:45,385
and prosecutors could become judges
and assholes like you
你要他遵守你们的规定

1504
02:00:45,727 --> 02:00:48,491
could get promoted to GS-16?
你们就可以掩盖你们的丑事？

1505
02:00:48,730 --> 02:00:50,994
Maggie, come on. You don't mean that.
玛姬，别这样，你不是那个意思。

1506
02:00:53,201 --> 02:00:55,761
Let me tell you something.
I hope he crossed over.
我来告诉你，我希望他能挺过来

1507
02:00:55,870 --> 02:01:00,034
Mrs. Pistone, there is a war going on
in the Mafia family where Joe is undercover.
皮斯顿小姐，乔打入的黑手党发生了家族内战

have been murdered.
内战中三个头目被杀

1509
02:01:02,844 --> 02:01:05,711
He's right in the line of fire.
Not because he's one of us,
他很危险，不是因他是我们的人

1510
02:01:05,814 --> 02:01:06,940
because he's one of them.
是因为他成了他们的人

1511
02:01:07,048 --> 02:01:10,984
Who he's with and who he's close to,
they're all the top dogs now.
成了他们中间少数头目之一

1512
02:01:13,154 --> 02:01:15,281
It's just not a problem we anticipated.
这是我们始料不及的

1513
02:01:15,390 --> 02:01:17,187
We have got to pull him out.
我们要把他挽救出来

1514

You have got to talk to him.
He'll listen to you.
你要跟他谈谈，他会听你的

1515
02:01:21,496 --> 02:01:22,656
You think so?

He was here a week ago.

1518
02:01:36,211 --> 02:01:39,442

didn't even say hello to me.
他没有惊醒我，连句好都没问

1519
02:01:44,185 --> 02:01:46,483
He came to get his sport coat.
他拿了件运动衫就走了

1520
02:02:01,369 --> 02:02:04,202
- Let's take a walk.
- All right.
- 我们出去走走
- 好的

1521
02:02:08,243 --> 02:02:10,006
Left, what are we doing?
嘿，老左，去哪儿？

1522
02:02:10,111 --> 02:02:13,376
We're gonna walk and talk.
We got too many eyes around here.
边走边谈吧，附近有人盯梢

1523
02:02:16,784 --> 02:02:21,050
Here it is, Donnie.
Sonny Red's kid, Bruno. He's disappeared.
就在这儿吧，东尼，红桑的儿子布诺跑掉了

1524

他是不会放过任何人的

1525
02:02:24,993 --> 02:02:26,620
ain't none of us safe.

1526
02:02:27,262 --> 02:02:29,059
- Right?

懂吗？是的

1527
02:02:29,164 --> 02:02:31,598
You got no idea where the guy is?
没有那家伙的消息吗？

1528

He's got a nickel-a-day coke habit.
He's gonna turn up somewhere.
那家伙是个可怕的瘾君子，他会四处活动

1529
02:02:36,838 --> 02:02:40,638
Anyway, we got the contract.

1530
02:02:44,445 --> 02:02:46,936
Now, this thing gets done right,
现在，事情还没过去

1531
02:02:47,048 --> 02:02:50,677
when the books open up,
I'm proposing you for membership.
等它告一段落我会全力举荐你

1532
02:02:51,186 --> 02:02:54,314

1533
02:02:54,455 --> 02:02:56,150
Yeah? What?
真的？说说看？

1534
02:02:56,291 --> 02:03:00,489

- You read my mind.
- 你希望我不能有闪失
- 嘿，你总算明白了，是吗？

1535
02:03:01,396 --> 02:03:05,628

- No, I won't fuck it up.
- 你总算懂了，千万别出事

1541
02:03:28,089 --> 02:03:30,182

What? I'm freezing here!

How much? What do you think?
以你看能值多少钱

You could get a sports fisherman
for maybe 300, used.
买条那种二手船大概三十万吧

1547
02:03:54,115 --> 02:03:56,447

1559
02:05:32,647 --> 02:05:33,671
Where is it?

There's $300,000 in that bag.

你是说你能推算出来？那是轮到你做的吗？

Who'd ever believe it wasn't my business?
不是我的生意？这是我的房子，谁说不关我的事？

- 那包是别人的
- 是吗？谁的？反正是别人的

1573
02:06:10,785 --> 02:06:13,515

- One of my best... Just some fucked-up guy.
- 反正是别人的

1574
02:06:13,621 --> 02:06:17,648

1591
02:08:20,581 --> 02:08:23,675
That's the same thing as if I put the bullet
in his head myself, you understand?
害死他等于自杀，明白吗？

1592
02:08:26,387 --> 02:08:29,015
I spent all these years
trying to be the good guy.

1593
02:08:29,123 --> 02:08:31,717
You know, the man in the white fucking hat.
我花了这么多年想混出头

1594
02:08:32,593 --> 02:08:33,821
For what?
为了什么？

1595
02:08:36,797 --> 02:08:37,991
For nothing.
什么都不为

1596
02:08:43,204 --> 02:08:46,173
I'm not becoming like them, Maggie.
I am them.
我不是像他们，玛姬，根本就是他们！

1597
02:09:24,845 --> 02:09:26,779
Left? Donnie.
老左？东尼

1598
02:09:26,881 --> 02:09:28,576
Donnie? Where you been?
是东尼，你在哪儿，东尼？

1599
02:09:28,683 --> 02:09:30,514
Yeah, look...
你听着，

1600
02:09:30,985 --> 02:09:33,681
- I gotta see you.
- You're right, you gotta see me.
- 我要见你
- 你搞快点，来见我

1601
02:09:33,788 --> 02:09:35,779
- We found Sonny Red's kid.
- Bruno?
- 我们发现红桑的儿子了
- 布诺？

1602
02:09:35,890 --> 02:09:38,620
Yeah, he's on a boat on Staten Island.
是的，他在斯顿岛的一条小船上

1603
02:09:38,726 --> 02:09:41,286
- I'll pick you up.
- We don't have time, Donnie.
- 我来接你，
- 没时间了，东尼

1604
02:09:41,395 --> 02:09:42,692
- You meet me there.
- Okay.
- 我们到那儿见，
- 好的

1605
02:10:06,854 --> 02:10:09,755
Bruno's here. He's down the end of the pier.
布诺在那儿？可以从那边下去

1606
02:10:11,258 --> 02:10:14,193
We'll wait here a minute
while he has his drink.
我们要等一会儿，他正在喝酒

1607
02:10:14,962 --> 02:10:17,192
Let him get a little sleepy.
等他困了，我也困了

1608
02:10:18,532 --> 02:10:21,990
- I'm getting a little sleepy myself.
- How's his boat?
- 我也困了
- 他的船在哪儿？

1609
02:10:22,703 --> 02:10:24,500
- The boat?
- Yeah.
- 船？
- 是的

1610
02:10:25,306 --> 02:10:26,603
Nice.
好了

1611
02:10:27,575 --> 02:10:31,443
Forget about it. One thing I know is boats.
得了吧，我知道的一件事就是船

1612
02:10:32,013 --> 02:10:35,813
I'd like to pop him, throw him in the water,
take the fucking boat.
我想揍他一顿，把他扔到水里，把船抢过来

1613
02:10:38,185 --> 02:10:42,713
Remember you said a couple of times
how if you had that Bertram again,
以前你怎么说的？再有机会…

1614
02:10:43,424 --> 02:10:47,292
you'd drive down to the pier with Annette
and just go?
你会带安莉塔和…他到码头去

1615
02:10:47,495 --> 02:10:51,192
Remember you said that? North, south,
east, west, nobody'd ever find you.
不记得了？到天南海北，谁也找不到

1616
02:10:51,298 --> 02:10:54,495
That was before.Don't remind me about that now.
那是以前了，别提以前的事

1617
02:10:54,635 --> 02:10:57,661
- Yeah, but I'm just saying...
- I don't want to think about that.
- 我只是想说…
- 别想那些事了

1618
02:10:57,772 --> 02:10:59,262
Did you mean it?
那你想过吗？

1619
02:11:00,374 --> 02:11:01,500
Mean it?
想？

1620
02:11:01,876 --> 02:11:04,538
Who am I? Rockefeller?
I'm gonna go buy a boat?
我是谁？洛克菲勒？我要买一艘船？

1621
02:11:05,046 --> 02:11:07,480
- I'm saying, what if, Left?
- What if.
我是说假如行呢，老左？假如？

1622
02:11:07,615 --> 02:11:08,912
What if...
假如...

1623
02:11:09,450 --> 02:11:13,580
I mean, I got a couple of things
going on the side. A couple of jewel things.
我是说假如我手上有些东西…

1624
02:11:14,822 --> 02:11:17,620
Maybe I could get that kind of money
for you.
比如珠宝…也许能帮你搞到钱

1625
02:11:20,561 --> 02:11:22,654
You're gonna find money
for me to get a boat?
你想挣钱替我买条船？也许吧

1626
02:11:22,763 --> 02:11:25,129
- Maybe.
- Yeah?
- 也许
- 也许？

1627
02:11:26,033 --> 02:11:28,297
That would be real generous of you, Donnie.
那说明你很'慷慨，东尼

1628
02:11:28,402 --> 02:11:32,566
What if I could hand you
a bagful of money right now?
那我现在就把一袋钱给你呢？

1629
02:11:33,841 --> 02:11:35,741
You know what I'm saying?

You could leave this life.
你可以脱离这种生活

1631
02:11:40,314 --> 02:11:42,373
You said it yourself, if you don't move up,
你自己说过，老左，假如你不能跳出来

1632
02:11:42,483 --> 02:11:44,451
every day you're looking over your shoulder.
每天都会有同样的压力

1633
02:11:44,552 --> 02:11:45,917
You don't know what's gonna happen.
你不知道会发生什么？

1634
02:11:46,020 --> 02:11:47,647
- Donnie, listen to me.
- No more bullshit.
- 东尼，你听我说，
- 少废话！

1635
02:11:47,755 --> 02:11:49,450
Get out of this life is what I'm saying, Left.
我说该结束这种生活了，老左

1636
02:11:49,557 --> 02:11:52,082

- What?
- 我想给你看一些东西，东尼
- 什么东西

1637
02:11:52,193 --> 02:11:55,026
I want you to look at it very carefully.
我要你非常细心的看完

1638
02:11:56,263 --> 02:11:59,721
And then I want you to think very carefully

1639
02:12:01,068 --> 02:12:03,400
about what you say to me.
你刚才对我说的话

1640
02:12:07,408 --> 02:12:09,706
That's a Federal boat, Donnie.
这是一艘FBI的船，东尼

1641
02:12:20,020 --> 02:12:22,614
- I really don't think that's the same boat...
- That's the same boat.
- 我真的不认为那是同一条船
- 那是同一条船

1642
02:12:22,723 --> 02:12:25,351
It's got the name on it, The Left Hand.
名字就在上面，在左舷

1643
02:12:25,459 --> 02:12:27,450
It's like my name.
像我名字一样

1644
02:12:28,829 --> 02:12:31,093
That's that Abscam boat.
就是那条阿巴斯康

1645
02:12:33,167 --> 02:12:35,761
You think I knew that was a Federal boat?

1646
02:12:37,338 --> 02:12:39,602
You think I'm a fucking rat?
你认为我是卧底？

1647
02:12:39,974 --> 02:12:43,466
How many times I have you into my own house?

Twice a week, at least. Why?

There it is, "At least."

1650

- I cook for you.
- Yeah.
- 我弄给你吃，

1651
02:12:55,222 --> 02:12:57,554
If ever I had any money, I'd give you.
有钱的时候，分给你用…

1652

I never had any money. But if ever I had...
虽然我穷…但我有钱的时候…

1653
02:13:01,395 --> 02:13:05,161
$100 in my pocket, I gave you $50, right?
我有一百，会分你五十，对吧？

02:13:06,433 --> 02:13:08,958
- Yeah, you did.

- 是的，我承认
- 如果你是卧底…

1655

If you're a rat, then I'm the biggest
fucking mutt in the history of the Mafia.
如果你真是卧底,我就是黑手党历史上最大的傻瓜

1656
02:13:25,186 --> 02:13:27,984
Even if this thing is a Federal boat, Left,
老左，如果那真是FBI的船

1657
02:13:29,590 --> 02:13:32,991
they scam all these other people.
They didn't scam us.
那也是他们从别处敲诈来的,他们并没敲诈我们

1658
02:13:33,093 --> 02:13:34,890
You know what I'm saying?
你明白我的意思吗？

We went. We had a great party.
We walked away from it.
我们去了，而且我们也走掉了

1660
02:13:42,336 --> 02:13:45,567
How do you know that we walked away from it?
你怎么知道我们真的走掉了

1661
02:13:45,739 --> 02:13:47,764
We're sitting here, right?
我们不是正坐在这儿吗？

1662
02:13:48,509 --> 02:13:51,569
So they tried to outsmart us,
but we outsmarted them.
也许他们是想做掉我们,但是我们赢了

1663
02:13:53,247 --> 02:13:55,147
We beat the agents.

1665
02:14:11,599 --> 02:14:12,759

Get this over with.

1668
02:14:27,081 --> 02:14:29,413
Two in back of the ear.
Like pushing a button.
黑暗中只听得见心跳

1669
02:14:29,516 --> 02:14:31,040
Bing, bing. That's it.
叭，叭，就这样

1670
02:14:31,185 --> 02:14:32,880
- Yeah.
- Don't freeze up.
- 是的，

- I'll be all right.
- 很多人会这样，
- 我还好

I can't believe you brought that up.
我说了你是卧底吗？我不能相信你是

1674
02:14:41,195 --> 02:14:42,958
Come on. Forget about it, Left.
来吧，得了吧，老左

I never said you was a rat.

I'm your best friend.

Shit!
妈的！

Don't say nothing, Donnie.
Don't say nothing to them.
别说！什么也别说！东尼！

- 你们完蛋了！
- 我操！我不会说！

There'll be a mouthpiece there in 24 hours!
Donnie, you're all right!
在那里呆上二十四小时就没事了

该认得东尼布拉斯科这家伙吧,那不是他的真名

That boat was a set-up.They set the boat up.
那条船是个圈套，他们安排好的

1700

1707
02:19:22,843 --> 02:19:24,640
Yeah. All right.
好吧

1708
02:19:26,046 --> 02:19:27,513
All right. Okay.
好吧，就这样

1709
02:19:35,556 --> 02:19:37,649
Was that for me?
是我的吗？

- 宝贝，不用等我，是吗

I don't know how long I'm gonna be.
