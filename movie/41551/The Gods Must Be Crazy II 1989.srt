00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,312
Sazu489...

1
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:16,976
<i>Anyone else would die of thirst</i>
<i>in a few days. In this arid desert...</i>

2
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:20,813
<i>... that looks like a paradise,</i>
<i>there's no surface water.</i>

3
00:00:20,987 --> 00:00:24,479
<i>But the slender, graceful</i>
<i>Bushmen of the Kalahari...</i>

4
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:29,788
<i>... live here contentedly and in complete</i>
<i>harmony with their environment.</i>

5
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:51,511
<i>They have lived undisturbed for</i>
<i>20,000 years because they are...</i>

6
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:56,553
<i>... the only people in the world who know</i>
<i>how to live without surface water.</i>

7
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:03,891
<i>When ivory poachers in high-tech</i>
<i>vehicles intrude into this thirst-land...</i>

8
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:08,467
<i>... to hunt elephant, they have to drag</i>
<i>reservoirs of water with them.</i>

9
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:14,705
<i>And when the water runs low they have</i>
<i>to hightail it out of the Kalahari again.</i>

10
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:22,074
<i>So the Bushmen work and play</i>
<i>in peaceful isolation unaware...</i>

11
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:25,581
<i>... of the crowded, hectic</i>
<i>world outside their domain...</i>

12
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:31,088
<i>... and even of the wars that are fought</i>
<i>on the very fringes of the Kalahari.</i>

13
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:36,986
<i>Sometimes Xixo tells about the time</i>
<i>he looked for the end of the Earth...</i>

14
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:40,064
<i>... and about the strange,</i>
<i>heavy people he met...</i>

15
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:44,397
<i>... but it's difficult to describe</i>
<i>those who live outside the Kalahari.</i>

16
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:48,632
<i>He always ends by saying the heavy</i>
<i>people know some magic...</i>

17
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:53,268
<i>... that can make things move</i>
<i>and even fly, but they're not bright...</i>

18
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:57,644
<i>... because they can't survive without</i>
<i>their magic contrivances.</i>

19
00:01:57,817 --> 00:01:59,751
<i>In the mornings, they like</i>
<i>to read the news.</i>

20
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:03,444
<i>They can read that</i>
<i>the hyena has a new girlfriend...</i>

21
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:08,526
<i>... the cheetah has lost a baby,</i>
<i>and the oryx is migrating to the west.</i>

22
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:13,928
<i>Older children teach younger ones how</i>
<i>to read the gossip about the animals...</i>

23
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:19,333
<i>... because everything that happens in</i>
<i>the Kalahari gets printed in the sand.</i>

24
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:25,977
It's all printed out here. This is where
they started infringing on the patent.

25
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,546
Give it to me there.

26
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:35,510
Now, that I can present in court.
Go back to frame A.

27
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:37,653
And give me sales.

28
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:42,721
Cathy, will you take this?
Take him off.

29
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,891
Now, cost per unit.
And a printout on that.

30
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:51,503
Mr. Geoffrey says he has to go to
Hong Kong about the takeover.

31
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:55,630
- Tell him, "Have a good flight."
- He won't make the ECACL conference.

32
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:59,539
- He can't do that to me.
- He'd like you to read the paper.

33
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:02,681
You did the research,
so you deserve the honor.

34
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,943
I have to take this case
to court on Wednesday.

35
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:09,519
- Says you'll be back before Wednesday.
- Oh, boy.

36
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:13,749
<i>That morning,</i>
<i>Xabe came with the news that...</i>

37
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,488
<i>... the animals are moving towards</i>
<i>the marula groves in the north.</i>

38
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:22,658
<i>He shouted, "The marulas are ripe.</i>
<i>Let's go collect some. "</i>

39
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:27,363
<i>Xisa and little Xiri ran up</i>
<i>and said, "Can we come too?"</i>

40
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:33,342
<i>Xixo said, "Let's see if you're big</i>
<i>enough. If you're taller than my bow...</i>

41
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:39,712
<i>... the hyena will be afraid and stay</i>
<i>away. If you're shorter, he'll take you. "</i>

42
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:43,885
<i>But Xiri said, "Please let me come too."</i>

43
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:47,925
<i>And Xisa said,</i>
<i>"I promise I'll always stay close to him."</i>

44
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:52,053
- Where is the conference this year?
- In Okakarara.

45
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:54,926
- Where's that, Nebraska?
- No, Africa.

46
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:57,296
Oh, boy.

47
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:07,905
<i>They gathered a lot of marulas</i>
<i>and on the way home they found...</i>

48
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,914
<i>... the spoor of a wounded elephant.</i>

49
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:21,491
<i>Xixo said, "This elephant is</i>
<i>very weak. It's going to die. "</i>

50
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:24,755
<i>He said to Xisa,</i>
<i>"You and Xiri can go on home.</i>

51
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:29,425
<i>Tell your mother we will come</i>
<i>when we've found the sick elephant. "</i>

52
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:58,191
<i>There was a very strange</i>
<i>and beautiful pattern on the ground.</i>

53
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:03,063
<i>Xisa couldn't read it. She'd never</i>
<i>seen anything like it in her life.</i>

54
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:06,399
<i>There was another</i>
<i>as beautiful as the first.</i>

55
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:11,509
<i>She wondered how anything could</i>
<i>make such a long, unbroken track.</i>

56
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:20,876
<i>She followed the track and saw</i>
<i>a very strange-looking thing.</i>

57
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:44,474
<i>She said,</i>
<i>"This thing went round and round...</i>

58
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:48,944
<i>... and that's how it made such a long</i>
<i>pattern without footprints. "</i>

59
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:02,926
<i>Xiri saw a beautiful dewdrop grow,</i>
<i>and when it dropped...</i>

60
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:06,361
<i>... another one began to grow</i>
<i>in its place.</i>

61
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:16,172
<i>They knew the gods put</i>
<i>dewdrops on plants in the night.</i>

62
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:20,438
<i>But here they could see</i>
<i>a dewdrop form in broad daylight.</i>

63
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:27,114
<i>Xisa said,</i>
<i>"I think this thing is making the water."</i>

64
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,047
<i>Xiri had never seen</i>
<i>so much water in his life.</i>

65
00:06:57,216 --> 00:07:00,617
<i>He didn't know there was</i>
<i>so much water in the whole world.</i>

66
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:42,187
<i>They found the elephant and saw</i>
<i>the tiny wounds that had made it die.</i>

67
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:45,626
<i>The tracks told Xixo the</i>
<i>heavy people had been there...</i>

68
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:50,258
<i>... but wondered why they took the</i>
<i>useless tusks and left the meat to rot.</i>

69
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:53,061
<i>He said,</i>
<i>"The heavy people are strange."</i>

70
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:56,640
<i>Bo said, "I'll call Xabo's family</i>
<i>to help us eat it.</i>

71
00:07:56,809 --> 00:08:00,108
<i>If I run all day and night</i>
<i>I can find them by tomorrow. "</i>

72
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:03,112
<i>Xixo said, "We'll go call our family."</i>

73
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:45,350
<i>There were many tusks. It takes the</i>
<i>gods more than a man's lifetime...</i>

74
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:51,464
<i>... to make a full-grown elephant, and it</i>
<i>horrified them to see so many had died.</i>

75
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:05,504
<i>Xixo and Xabe found the place where</i>
<i>Xisa and Xiri's tracks suddenly stopped.</i>

76
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:11,446
<i>Xixo said, "Xisa climbed onto the thing.</i>
<i>Xiri went up too, and it took them away. "</i>

77
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:16,316
<i>He said, "Tell our family they must</i>
<i>start eating the dead elephant.</i>

78
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:18,320
<i>I'll fetch Xisa and Xiri. "</i>

79
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,800
Sorry about the short notice,
but we're honored to have you.

80
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:35,566
Thank you. I would've
liked the safari tour...

81
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:38,972
...but I have to prepare my presentation.
- You'll be all right?

82
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:42,410
- I'll be fine, thank you.
- Good. I'll leave you to it.

83
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:52,721
- You know where Stephen's working?
- I think I've got a rough idea.

84
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:57,591
- You may have to search around a bit.
- Right.

85
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,560
- And Jack?
- Yeah?

86
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:04,192
Tell Stephen we'll send the rest
of the stuff out to him later.

87
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:10,436
What's a nice girl like you
doing in a place like this?

88
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,238
- Oh, boy.
- You don't buy it.

89
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:16,074
Okay, I'll try again.

90
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:23,021
- Hi. Like to come fly with me?
- I have to work. That's why no safari trip.

91
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:27,418
Trip's three hours.
I could show you Africa in half an hour.

92
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,594
I have to present this at 3:30.

93
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:37,161
- Only half an hour?
- Yes, doctor.

94
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:44,870
- So, what are you, a doctor of medicine?
- No, corporate law.

95
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:49,504
- What a tiny plane.
- We got a smaller one but can't find it.

96
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:52,977
- Can it fly?
- In you go.

97
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,038
- What are those?
- Buffalo.

98
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:27,543
Look, no hands. Flies by itself.
Safest plane in the world.

99
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:39,555
- Coffee.
- Morning, boss.

100
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:45,765
- You only done 80 miles.
- Yeah, I slept a little bit.

101
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:50,340
- You stopped.
- I was bushed. So I pulled up and...

102
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:53,876
- You slept more than four hours.
- I was real pooped.

103
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:57,106
- I told you we're late.
- I was really pooped, boss.

104
00:11:57,516 --> 00:12:00,280
- Move over.
- It's okay, boss. I'm fresh now.

105
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:02,180
Jeez, boss.

106
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:11,758
Lazy bastard.

107
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:21,529
- Get back to sleep.
- I'm wide-awake now.

108
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:24,699
- Sleep.
- Yes, boss.

109
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:58,407
I'll be right back.

110
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,930
- Hi, Stephen.
- Hi. Thanks.

111
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:23,090
You're cutting it fine.
There's a hell of a cumulus building up.

112
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:27,797
One of those thermals grabs you,
it's gonna whip you right to 20,000 feet.

113
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:31,306
- See you later.
<i>- Stephen, is Geoff there yet? Over.</i>

114
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,968
Hi, Bob. Yes, he's here. Over.

115
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,171
<i>Can you fly back in with him?</i>

116
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:41,149
<i>We found a sick baby giraffe.</i>
<i>We need your advice. Over.</i>

117
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,845
Okay. Out.

118
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:55,156
- You can't cart your floozies around.
- She's not a floozy.

119
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:57,460
- Hi.
- Morning.

120
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:12,311
Do you do some kind
of work around here?

121
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:28,055
<i>Hello, Stephen. Come in. Over.</i>

122
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:31,567
<i>Stephen, are you there? Over.</i>

123
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:36,030
<i>- Stephen, come in. Over.</i>
- Hi, Bob. This is Jack. Over.

124
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:42,703
<i>Jack, don't take off yet. There's</i>
<i>a freak storm moving in very fast. Over.</i>

125
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:48,950
- Bob, they've just taken off. Over.
<i>- They? Someone is with him? Over.</i>

126
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:52,612
- Yes. Over.
<i>- Who? Over.</i>

127
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:57,854
- There was this young lady. Over.
<i>- Was she with you? Over.</i>

128
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:03,969
- Sort of. Over.
<i>- Boy, you're in trouble. Over.</i>

129
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:06,399
Over.

130
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:14,110
<i>Xixo's old friend Waka was looking</i>
<i>at the tracks the heavy people made.</i>

131
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:19,946
<i>Xixo greeted him and said his children</i>
<i>were in the thing that made the tracks.</i>

132
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:24,488
<i>Waka greeted him back and said,</i>
<i>"I'll come with you to find your children."</i>

133
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:28,126
<i>But Xixo said,</i>
<i>"There's a dead elephant back there.</i>

134
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:31,422
<i>Go with your family</i>
<i>to help my family eat it. "</i>

135
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,404
They stopped.

136
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,412
- There's whiskey under your seat.
- I'm okay.

137
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:02,145
- Give it to me.
- You gonna start drinking?

138
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:04,289
Give me.

139
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:18,302
Can this thing fly on Scotch?

140
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,795
George.

141
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:50,525
Boss?

142
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:52,932
Take over.

143
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:01,869
<i>Xisa said,</i>
<i>"When this thing gets tired it will rest.</i>

144
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:05,244
<i>Then we can follow the tracks</i>
<i>back home. "</i>

145
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,097
Running out of Scotch.

146
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:29,004
This any good?

147
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:41,280
We're flying backwards.

148
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:01,591
I have to read my paper at 3:30.

149
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:10,508
How do I get back? We have to find
a road so I can hitch a ride.

150
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,846
So which way to the nearest road?

151
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:20,780
- This is baobab country.
- It can speak.

152
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:23,921
- We're at least 300 miles from base.
- Oh, boy.

153
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:25,579
Maybe more.

154
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:38,429
- I'm sorry.
- Any time.

155
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:44,099
- I have to get to a phone.
- I don't even know what country we're in.

156
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:46,037
Hey!

157
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:49,872
- What?
- They're not scared of me.

158
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:52,209
- So?
- They don't know about people.

159
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:54,750
- We're in the deep Kalahari.
- Will they find us?

160
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,784
- Eventually.
- How long is eventually?

161
00:20:57,956 --> 00:21:00,823
Maybe a day, maybe a week.

162
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:03,961
I have to be back in New York
on Wednesday.

163
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:07,326
- You're from New York?
- I have to survive here for a week?

164
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,466
Anyone who can survive
in New York can survive here.

165
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:14,572
- We'll starve to death.
- There's enough food around here.

166
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:19,607
Our problem will be water.
All we have is that six-pack up there.

167
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:32,420
<i>They were getting thirsty, but they knew</i>
<i>where there was plenty of water.</i>

168
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:22,799
<i>She said,</i>
<i>"No, I'm too heavy to pull up.</i>

169
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:26,876
<i>Come down here so you can push</i>
<i>me up. Then I can pull you up. "</i>

170
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:39,252
<i>Xiri had never been in water in his life...</i>

171
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:42,825
<i>... but soon got used to it</i>
<i>and quite enjoyed it.</i>

172
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:47,861
Is that water?

173
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,524
- Petrol. Gas.
- So?

174
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:53,636
If I can get this down, we can fly out.

175
00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:55,372
Today?

176
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,873
I have to take it apart,
bring it down, assemble it again.

177
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:03,911
- Eventually.
- Maybe by tomorrow, the next day.

178
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:06,779
Was that a lion?

179
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:12,245
- I can hear them.
- Let down the rope. I want to get up.

180
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:15,056
- They won't bother us.
- You're okay.

181
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:20,062
- They're bothering me down here.
- They're not coming this way.

182
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:21,765
What about eventually?

183
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:25,465
Don't bother them,
they won't bother you.

184
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:30,572
- And if they're hungry?
- They're far from here.

185
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:39,416
It's swarming with wild animals here.

186
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,609
Don't bother them,
they won't bother you.

187
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:44,219
I'm not bothering them.

188
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:50,891
This one is drooling at me.

189
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:55,123
- It's a hyena. They're always drooling.
- So?

190
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,963
Ignore him. Don't smile at him.
He sees your teeth...

191
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:03,005
...he might think you're threatening him.
- Let me get up.

192
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:13,644
- You're enjoying this.
- Yeah.

193
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:16,788
- Why don't you relax and enjoy it too?
- Enjoy?

194
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:21,789
- Wild animals, no food, no water.
- No room service.

195
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:25,326
Yeah, no plumbing.
What I need is plumbing. Now.

196
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:29,533
- Go behind that thicket.
- Alone? The lions are that way.

197
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:35,172
- They're very far. If you don't bother...
- They won't bother me. I know, I know.

198
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:42,944
- How do I get down?
- How'd you get up there?

199
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:45,844
- The lion was roaring.
- Wasn't a lion.

200
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:48,349
It was a hyena sounding off.

201
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:53,183
Right.

202
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,651
Now, just a minute. Turn your back.

203
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:00,858
- Pull me up.
- I can't. Friction.

204
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:02,522
Then let me down.

205
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:04,962
- Stop.
- What do you want me to do?

206
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:08,333
- Don't look at me.
- I'm not. What do you want me to do?

207
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,997
Let me down.

208
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:23,313
What's so funny?

209
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:40,497
Okay, I won't bother you, see?
So don't you bother me.

210
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:45,438
- Watch it!
- Go away!

211
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,804
Run, run, run, run, run, run.
Get up a tree!

212
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:55,614
You okay?

213
00:25:56,721 --> 00:26:01,681
- You said if I didn't bother them...
- I see there's a baby rhino.

214
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,294
Maybe the mother thought you
were molesting it.

215
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:07,727
I only talked to it.
I didn't even smile at it.

216
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:10,628
- They're going away.
- I'm not coming down...

217
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:15,204
...before you can fly me out of here.
- There's no plumbing up there.

218
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:38,329
- You thirsty?
- Yes.

219
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:41,761
- Right, you can have half a beer.
- Great.

220
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,128
- Don't open it yet.
- Sorry. Oh, my goodness.

221
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:53,943
Sorry. What did I do wrong?

222
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:58,439
Well, it's warm. Drink it now.

223
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:05,116
Right. It's getting late.

224
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:10,822
We have to find food before it gets dark.
I saw an ostrich nest.

225
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:40,655
- Do they bite?
- No, they kick. But they aren't bright.

226
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:45,319
You lie down flat, he can't see you.
That's the male. He guards the eggs.

227
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:50,694
- But if you can distract him...
- How do I distract a male ostrich?

228
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:52,726
Lie down flat!

229
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:55,684
<i>Xixo thought he saw</i>
<i>his children's footprints...</i>

230
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,693
<i>... but it was only a baboon</i>
<i>that had walked past.</i>

231
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:43,835
- So, what went wrong?
- Nothing. We got the egg.

232
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:47,307
You mean that was standard procedure?

233
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:49,840
Got a match?

234
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:52,344
The thing came back. I'm sorry.

235
00:30:53,651 --> 00:30:57,178
- You got a match?
- I got a lighter.

236
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:25,712
<i>Big Ben calling Ramjee. Big Ben</i>
<i>calling Ramjee. Do you read me?</i>

237
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:28,885
Ramjee, come in. Big Ben calling.

238
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:34,286
- Come in, Ramjee. Still out of range.
- Maybe they're not there yet.

239
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:37,917
He said he'd meet us on the ninth.
That's yesterday.

240
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:40,596
Sorry, boss.

241
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:55,710
<i>- 10,000 people will attend the opening.</i>
<i>Although nine helicopters...</i>

242
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:02,046
<i>... and four planes are taking part,</i>
<i>no sign of Dr. Marshall and Dr. Taylor.</i>

243
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,120
- Was that us?
- I suppose so.

244
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:06,052
- Doctor of what?
- Zoology.

245
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:08,118
- You?
- Law.

246
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,611
- We have to watch that guy.
- Hyena?

247
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:38,119
He's a coward. If you're taller
than him, he'll keep his distance.

248
00:32:38,356 --> 00:32:41,757
But if you lie down he'll sneak up
and take a chunk out of your leg.

249
00:32:41,926 --> 00:32:45,589
Take first watch.
Call me when the moon gets there...

250
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:49,927
...I'll take it to there,
then you take it to first light.

251
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:33,977
Coming down.

252
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:42,215
- I'm ready.
- For what?

253
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:49,720
You only jumped 25 centimeters.
What happened to standard procedure?

254
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:51,191
Maybe next time.

255
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:58,028
- Where we gonna take off from?
- There's a saltpan three miles from here.

256
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,931
How many blocks is that?

257
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:14,080
Keep the sun over your right shoulder.
Stay clear of low branches.

258
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,189
- What?
- It's that damn rhino.

259
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:26,626
It's a male. It's harmless.
Why are you always climbing up trees?

260
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:30,766
I'm not a doctor of zoology. How do
I know about males and females?

261
00:34:30,935 --> 00:34:33,870
Damn near wrecked the nose wheel.

262
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:36,370
Give me slack.

263
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:51,415
- You only jumped 124 centimeters.
- These things are dangerous.

264
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:53,479
It's very small.

265
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:57,416
- When it grabs hold it never lets go.
- Kind of cute.

266
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,962
Hey. No!

267
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:08,470
- Now we've got a flat.
- What do I do with this?

268
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:12,632
- Why don't you throw it away?
- It'll just come right back.

269
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:17,473
Can you change the tire?

270
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:19,673
- Can you undo my boot?
- Why?

271
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:25,186
It's the one that stepped on him. If I
give it to him, he can have his revenge.

272
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:16,231
- Is there enough gas to take us back?
- lf we get it off the ground.

273
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:27,741
- No, it won't work.
- Can't you fix it?

274
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:29,510
No pump.

275
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:50,169
You wanna be the wheel.
You're crazy.

276
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:53,902
You see that stick?
When I shout, bring it this way.

277
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:57,775
- I can't fly.
- It'll lift your side, then center up.

278
00:36:57,982 --> 00:37:00,007
When I shout again, pull back.

279
00:37:00,184 --> 00:37:02,482
Bring it over, center, pull back.

280
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:04,621
- Then what?
- I'll take over.

281
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:08,782
But I can't even drive a manual.
Do you wanna kill us both?

282
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:11,894
You're nuts. I can't fly.
Do you hear me?

283
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,588
- I can't fly a plane.
- Throttles.

284
00:37:14,765 --> 00:37:17,290
- What?
- Shiny ones, push them forward.

285
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:18,934
Here we go.

286
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:24,598
- Come on. Stick it back. Center up.
- I told you I can't fly.

287
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:26,242
Right now, pull back.

288
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,945
- You said pull back.
- Not way back.

289
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:36,576
- Pull it, pull it, pull it.
- Will you make up your mind?

290
00:37:38,155 --> 00:37:41,921
- Bring her down, bring her down.
- What?

291
00:37:42,126 --> 00:37:46,290
- We go that way.
- You said you were gonna take over.

292
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:56,236
- You should have gone that way. Shit.
- Shit.

293
00:37:56,641 --> 00:38:00,270
Trust a woman to do anything,
and she buggers it up.

294
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:06,681
So she buggered it up.

295
00:39:00,237 --> 00:39:04,469
Look down and read. It says, "on<i>l</i>off."
Switch it off, then glide.

296
00:39:26,063 --> 00:39:28,861
I told you I can't fly.

297
00:39:29,633 --> 00:39:32,227
It says, "Ballistic parachute." Clearly.

298
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:35,566
Read it. Press the button.
You'll be okay.

299
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:44,571
I told you I can't even drive a manual.

300
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:52,521
It's easy. Bring it over, center it up,
pull back. Get it right!

301
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:57,753
I showed you so nicely. I said,
"Bring it over." Not, "Bring it over!"

302
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,723
You'll break your neck.

303
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:05,297
You don't explain properly.
I could have broken my neck.

304
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:14,606
How am I going to find you
with only one boot?

305
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:16,940
Better find my boot.

306
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,257
Shoo. Go away.

307
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,038
Shit.

308
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:35,749
Wait!

309
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:42,458
Hi. Do you want to sell me your bike?

310
00:41:44,568 --> 00:41:48,470
Look. I'll give you money.

311
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:51,906
I give you money,
you give me the bike.

312
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:58,274
I have to go that way. There's a man.
I'll pay you, you take me that way.

313
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:02,382
Here.

314
00:42:02,586 --> 00:42:08,650
Please, I insist. Okay.
Pay you when we get there. There?

315
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,930
Well, why don't we try
something else?

316
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,768
Yeah, sure.

317
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:03,613
All right.

318
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:05,738
Good thinking.

319
00:43:18,996 --> 00:43:21,089
Are you gonna hang in there forever?

320
00:43:30,507 --> 00:43:33,670
There. Lunch. Go on, try it.

321
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:48,185
Okay, try that.

322
00:45:21,485 --> 00:45:24,511
Look, I'm really sorry.
Please, take this.

323
00:45:25,522 --> 00:45:27,217
No, come on.

324
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:32,259
Bye.

325
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:38,061
Well, thanks. Bye.
Gotta find somebody.

326
00:46:07,731 --> 00:46:10,063
You said you were tired.

327
00:46:47,104 --> 00:46:49,072
Hey, go home.

328
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,005
Go back to your family.

329
00:46:58,882 --> 00:47:00,816
Go on, get.

330
00:47:01,118 --> 00:47:04,019
Get. Shoo. Go.

331
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:27,489
English?

332
00:50:28,325 --> 00:50:29,849
Okay.

333
00:50:30,227 --> 00:50:31,717
Get up.

334
00:50:34,598 --> 00:50:36,361
- Move.
- Which way?

335
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:38,057
To my jeep.

336
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:42,665
Stop. Where are you going?

337
00:50:43,907 --> 00:50:46,171
Where is your jeep?

338
00:50:47,944 --> 00:50:50,435
We go to your jeep.

339
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:00,822
Stop.

340
00:51:09,533 --> 00:51:12,366
- March.
- Which way?

341
00:51:14,438 --> 00:51:16,633
Know why a compass
is a mirror on back?

342
00:51:19,876 --> 00:51:22,401
- Why?
- So you can see who's lost.

343
00:51:24,448 --> 00:51:28,350
Okay. We go northwest.
That way. March.

344
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:23,833
How far did you fly, for Pete's sake?

345
00:52:24,908 --> 00:52:27,001
How am I going to find you?

346
00:53:47,924 --> 00:53:49,289
Damn.

347
00:54:16,886 --> 00:54:18,319
Hey.

348
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:22,558
Hey, you, get away. Leave it alone.

349
00:54:26,463 --> 00:54:28,522
Get out of here.

350
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:34,835
Give me back my can. Scumbag.

351
00:54:36,573 --> 00:54:38,268
You mugger.

352
00:54:44,047 --> 00:54:45,537
Thank you.

353
00:54:52,756 --> 00:54:54,621
You keep away.

354
00:54:58,695 --> 00:55:00,287
Stay there.

355
00:55:02,832 --> 00:55:06,825
See these? You dare...

356
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:10,671
Don't even think about it.

357
00:55:13,777 --> 00:55:15,608
You'll be sorry.

358
00:55:24,187 --> 00:55:25,950
Go away.

359
00:55:30,727 --> 00:55:34,026
Okay. You can have this one
and no more.

360
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:38,395
Leave the can. Do you hear me?

361
00:55:39,469 --> 00:55:42,802
Leave my can alone and go away.

362
00:55:50,246 --> 00:55:51,907
No, don't bring a friend.

363
00:55:53,483 --> 00:55:58,216
I'm not gonna water you, your friends
and your relatives, and I'm not...

364
00:56:39,295 --> 00:56:42,628
- Excerpts from the Geneva Convention.
- Forget it.

365
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:45,768
How a prisoner of war
ought to be treated.

366
00:56:45,935 --> 00:56:49,632
"No prisoner shall be subjected
to inhumane treatment.

367
00:56:49,806 --> 00:56:52,741
- No outrage shall be committed."
- Stop.

368
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:56,310
- You can rest for three minutes.
- What's your hurry?

369
00:56:56,479 --> 00:56:58,470
None of your business.

370
00:57:06,189 --> 00:57:07,622
Three minutes.

371
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:10,456
I'm pooped, man.

372
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:22,068
Don't do that. Come back. I'm going to
report you to the Geneva Convention!

373
00:57:22,305 --> 00:57:25,502
Come back. You're my prisoner.
Come back!

374
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:34,083
Come out of there
and be my prisoner!

375
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:44,115
- You mustn't do that!
- March.

376
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:53,660
If you're so smart, how come you
don't even know what country you're in?

377
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:57,773
So which way did they go?

378
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:04,138
I'll just have to wait till
they come back.

379
00:58:10,887 --> 00:58:14,118
<i>Xixo saw a heavy person</i>
<i>dressed in funny clothes...</i>

380
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:19,318
<i>... talking to herself. She looked</i>
<i>like a woman, but had a man's voice.</i>

381
00:58:26,202 --> 00:58:27,635
Hey.

382
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:35,778
It's your way of greeting.
We do it this way.

383
00:58:37,881 --> 00:58:39,371
Sorry.

384
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:42,040
Okay. I'll do it your way.

385
00:58:42,819 --> 00:58:45,287
Hello. I'm very glad to meet you.

386
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:52,157
<i>He said, "Where is your family?"</i>

387
00:58:52,729 --> 00:58:56,426
<i>He looked at her tracks and said,</i>
<i>"How did you get here?</i>

388
00:58:56,599 --> 00:59:00,933
<i>I have to find my children, but</i>
<i>two people are playing some game.</i>

389
00:59:01,104 --> 00:59:03,334
<i>They went that way. I hear them.</i>

390
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:07,067
<i>- Perhaps they'll let you play. "</i>
- You want me to go?

391
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:27,363
<i>He showed her the tracks where he met</i>
<i>the two heavy men.</i>

392
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:29,862
<i>He said,</i>
<i>"This is where they turned back.</i>

393
00:59:30,133 --> 00:59:34,126
<i>This one was angry because</i>
<i>the tired one grabbed the stick.</i>

394
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:37,237
<i>And then he had to run.</i>
<i>It was very funny. "</i>

395
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:41,742
<i>She couldn't understand.</i>
<i>She was also quite illiterate.</i>

396
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:45,278
<i>She couldn't read the signs</i>
<i>and tracks at all.</i>

397
00:59:55,124 --> 00:59:57,115
We're waiting for a bus?

398
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:04,460
Well, what do you know.

399
01:00:15,745 --> 01:00:19,613
Go away. Bugger off.
I don't want to see you. Stop!

400
01:00:19,816 --> 01:00:21,443
Who are you?

401
01:00:28,091 --> 01:00:31,527
<i>Xixo couldn't understand what</i>
<i>they were playing.</i>

402
01:00:31,694 --> 01:00:33,525
This thing penetrates.

403
01:00:33,696 --> 01:00:36,392
You wouldn't shoot a lady.

404
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:39,124
<i>He said, "I have to find my children."</i>

405
01:00:39,335 --> 01:00:42,702
<i>The men had bad manners,</i>
<i>so he didn't say goodbye.</i>

406
01:00:42,905 --> 01:00:46,204
I don't want to be involved.
I'm American.

407
01:00:46,409 --> 01:00:47,706
Okay.

408
01:00:50,013 --> 01:00:54,473
Hey, you can't leave me here.
You want me to die?

409
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,515
Get away from me.

410
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:04,417
Get away.

411
01:01:05,728 --> 01:01:07,662
Try again, huh?

412
01:01:15,371 --> 01:01:18,033
It's not fair. You can't both use me.

413
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:22,166
Let me go! Let me go. Let me go!

414
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:26,505
Okay, drop it.

415
01:01:26,983 --> 01:01:29,645
- Drop it.
- Yes, drop it.

416
01:01:32,889 --> 01:01:36,188
- Now, drop it.
- Yes, drop it, drop it, drop it!

417
01:01:40,463 --> 01:01:42,021
Can't we negotiate?

418
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:47,226
I wanna go home. If I don't get back
to Biera, I'll miss my plane to Cuba.

419
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:52,237
- I'll spend another six months here.
- I've got to take you to my base!

420
01:01:52,475 --> 01:01:56,969
- I must be in New York on Wednesday.
- Sit down. And stay clear of the Cuban.

421
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:59,374
I'll stay clear of goddamn both of you.

422
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:02,484
I resent being used as a hostage object.

423
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:04,986
Gotta be in New York on Wednesday.

424
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:10,591
You should have stayed there.
I didn't ask you to come out here.

425
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:13,024
I have to walk my arse off to find you.

426
01:02:16,032 --> 01:02:18,296
Well, good.

427
01:02:21,771 --> 01:02:23,136
What's so funny?

428
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:33,715
Switch it on.

429
01:02:35,017 --> 01:02:38,418
Big Ben calling Ramjee.
Big Ben calling Ramjee.

430
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:40,488
- What are you doing?
- What am I doing?

431
01:02:40,656 --> 01:02:42,988
Look at the sun.
You're going the wrong way.

432
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:45,320
Boss, I'm driving on the compass.

433
01:02:45,528 --> 01:02:49,464
This thing is made of steel.
You left it there.

434
01:02:49,632 --> 01:02:51,293
Look at the needle.

435
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:54,334
You buggered the compass,
you stupid bastard.

436
01:02:54,537 --> 01:02:58,337
- Jeez, boss, I wasn't thinking. I'm real...
- Stop the bloody truck.

437
01:03:16,192 --> 01:03:17,819
So when did you put it there?

438
01:03:17,994 --> 01:03:22,260
Well, I drank some coffee
just at sunrise, boss.

439
01:03:22,431 --> 01:03:27,198
Five hours. Forty degrees off.
Stupid bastard.

440
01:03:29,205 --> 01:03:33,141
Big Ben calling Ramjee.
Do you read me, for chrissakes?

441
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:37,935
- Ramjee, come in.
<i>- Big Ben, where the hell are you?</i>

442
01:03:39,382 --> 01:03:42,146
Look, I'm sorry.
This idiot bugged the compass.

443
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:45,981
<i>I've been waiting three bloody days!</i>
<i>Where the bloody hell are you?</i>

444
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:48,817
We could have been there,
but we're way off course.

445
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:53,018
Now we have to backtrack for
at least five hours to find our bearings.

446
01:04:09,111 --> 01:04:12,512
We're going back in our tracks,
so we'll be out of range again.

447
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:15,879
I'll contact you
when we come back into range.

448
01:04:32,068 --> 01:04:34,832
<i>Little Xiri saw hyena tracks.</i>

449
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:41,736
<i>The spoor was very fresh</i>
<i>so he knew the hyena must be close.</i>

450
01:04:43,179 --> 01:04:46,740
<i>And it was downwind,</i>
<i>so it was sure to smell him.</i>

451
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:09,735
<i>He remembered</i>
<i>his father had said:</i>

452
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:13,535
<i>"If you're taller than the hyena,</i>
<i>it will keep its distance. "</i>

453
01:05:19,482 --> 01:05:23,578
<i>It couldn't understand how this small</i>
<i>creature had grown tall so suddenly.</i>

454
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:42,127
<i>Perhaps the hyena hoped that Xiri</i>
<i>would get small again, so it followed...</i>

455
01:05:42,305 --> 01:05:44,068
<i>... at a respectful distance.</i>

456
01:05:54,517 --> 01:05:57,748
Well, we got flown here
in a kind of a plane...

457
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:00,354
...and then I kind of lost Dr. Marshall.

458
01:06:01,857 --> 01:06:04,826
Get in the jeep. Move.

459
01:06:08,431 --> 01:06:09,830
Wait there.

460
01:06:12,234 --> 01:06:14,259
- Okay, but leave your bag.
- Why?

461
01:06:14,437 --> 01:06:16,928
- You swat people.
- No, I won't. I promise.

462
01:06:17,106 --> 01:06:20,439
- Look, I'll take out the rocks.
- You got rocks in there?

463
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:24,112
You drive.

464
01:06:27,516 --> 01:06:28,778
In there.

465
01:06:33,289 --> 01:06:35,018
Start her up.

466
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:38,324
That way.

467
01:06:51,574 --> 01:06:54,737
<i>Xixo saw another track made</i>
<i>by a heavy person...</i>

468
01:06:54,910 --> 01:06:58,141
<i>... and the footprints told of a man</i>
<i>who was in a bad way.</i>

469
01:06:58,314 --> 01:06:59,747
<i>He spoke to the track:</i>

470
01:06:59,915 --> 01:07:03,316
<i>"I can see you need help</i>
<i>but I must find my children. "</i>

471
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,065
Turn right.

472
01:07:20,569 --> 01:07:21,695
Stop.

473
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:23,600
Hey, that's my jeep.

474
01:07:23,906 --> 01:07:25,396
I know, I knew it.

475
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:29,878
- Go siphon.
- Gas?

476
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:32,014
But my tank was almost empty.

477
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:34,846
Oh, boy.

478
01:07:54,236 --> 01:07:55,396
Hi.

479
01:07:59,608 --> 01:08:01,974
<i>Xixo said, "I don't know what to do.</i>

480
01:08:02,144 --> 01:08:06,376
<i>You need someone to find water for</i>
<i>you, but I'm worried about my children.</i>

481
01:08:06,549 --> 01:08:09,985
<i>I've been running for two days,</i>
<i>and I haven't found them.</i>

482
01:08:10,152 --> 01:08:12,712
<i>I think they're very far. "</i>

483
01:08:22,731 --> 01:08:24,358
What have you got?

484
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:26,390
About two liters.

485
01:08:26,569 --> 01:08:28,764
Fourteen, 15 kilometers.

486
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:31,566
- How much have you got in here?
- 20 kilometers.

487
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:34,436
- And how far is your base?
- Sixty, 65.

488
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:35,736
Oh, my God.

489
01:08:35,911 --> 01:08:38,106
- My base is only 20 kilometers.
- Shut up.

490
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:39,941
Get up.

491
01:08:42,318 --> 01:08:43,376
Watch it!

492
01:08:45,387 --> 01:08:46,513
Stop it!

493
01:08:49,492 --> 01:08:51,483
I said, stop it!

494
01:08:55,264 --> 01:08:56,822
Stop it right now!

495
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:08,337
Lady, be careful with that thing.

496
01:09:08,511 --> 01:09:10,001
- Give it to me.
- I won't.

497
01:09:10,179 --> 01:09:12,773
But I'm the good guy here.
He's a bloody Cuban.

498
01:09:12,948 --> 01:09:14,006
Give it to me.

499
01:09:14,683 --> 01:09:16,207
Jeez, lady.

500
01:09:16,418 --> 01:09:19,046
Yes, make my day.

501
01:09:19,455 --> 01:09:23,221
Okay, <i>señorita</i>. My base
is only 20 kilometers away.

502
01:09:23,425 --> 01:09:25,655
There gonna be a plane
to Cuba tomorrow.

503
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:29,161
- I'll take you there.
- This guy doesn't know where he is.

504
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:33,734
- How are you going to find your base?
- You can find it. You're so smart.

505
01:09:33,936 --> 01:09:35,995
- We're going to my base.
- Who says?

506
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:37,696
- I says!
- Stop it!

507
01:09:43,712 --> 01:09:46,237
You, get behind the wheel.

508
01:09:46,448 --> 01:09:47,574
No.

509
01:09:48,317 --> 01:09:51,844
No, get back. You gotta stay together.

510
01:09:53,956 --> 01:09:55,583
Take his hand.

511
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:01,095
I said hold hands!

512
01:10:06,101 --> 01:10:07,466
Okay, get in.

513
01:10:13,676 --> 01:10:15,906
You go around that way.

514
01:10:24,019 --> 01:10:25,281
Okay.

515
01:10:26,355 --> 01:10:29,791
- Now, can either of you fly a plane?
- Yeah, I can.

516
01:10:30,192 --> 01:10:32,786
Good. Drive back to where we started.

517
01:10:52,514 --> 01:10:53,947
Watch it, boss!

518
01:10:58,787 --> 01:11:00,812
Jeez, boss, we killed a little kid.

519
01:11:01,023 --> 01:11:05,016
- Sit down. We've got to get out of here.
- But, boss, it was a little kid.

520
01:11:12,601 --> 01:11:14,034
He's okay.

521
01:12:39,521 --> 01:12:41,648
- Jeez, there's another one.
- Bugger.

522
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:47,185
Xiri! Xiri!

523
01:12:48,831 --> 01:12:51,527
Xiri! Xiri!

524
01:12:51,934 --> 01:12:54,095
<i>Now Xisa didn't know which way to go.</i>

525
01:12:54,269 --> 01:12:57,204
<i>What if her little brother</i>
<i>had been left back there?</i>

526
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:16,455
Stop here.

527
01:13:18,293 --> 01:13:20,022
This is where the Bushman found me.

528
01:13:20,195 --> 01:13:24,097
That means the plane must be...

529
01:13:29,872 --> 01:13:31,703
That guy's only bad news.

530
01:13:39,948 --> 01:13:41,609
- Follow him.
- We're low on gas.

531
01:13:41,784 --> 01:13:43,274
- Follow him.
- We low on gas.

532
01:13:43,452 --> 01:13:44,919
Follow him.

533
01:14:45,013 --> 01:14:46,241
Hi.

534
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:49,949
Hold hands.

535
01:14:53,355 --> 01:14:54,982
Get out that side.

536
01:14:57,826 --> 01:14:59,350
Go that way.

537
01:15:01,563 --> 01:15:02,894
Stop.

538
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:08,697
Goodbye, thank you.

539
01:15:09,638 --> 01:15:11,037
What happened?

540
01:15:11,206 --> 01:15:14,835
It's nothing, just kind of dehydrated.

541
01:15:22,417 --> 01:15:26,285
- Does W stand for water?
- I don't have to tell you.

542
01:15:37,099 --> 01:15:39,158
Okay, open your mouth.

543
01:15:47,609 --> 01:15:49,543
Who's the little guy
who gave me that stuff?

544
01:15:49,711 --> 01:15:53,704
I don't know. He just keeps on
appearing and disappearing.

545
01:15:57,419 --> 01:16:00,217
- Who are they?
- They're soldiers.

546
01:16:01,056 --> 01:16:04,082
They look very affectionate.

547
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:06,359
No.

548
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:10,357
- Are they your prisoners?
- Kind of.

549
01:16:10,532 --> 01:16:14,059
We're hostages. She hijacked
my jeep and she kidnapped us.

550
01:16:14,236 --> 01:16:17,967
You did it to me first! Both of them.
He did it and then he did it.

551
01:16:18,206 --> 01:16:20,367
- She hit me first.
- You hit him?

552
01:16:21,443 --> 01:16:24,708
- Yeah.
- She hit me too. Damn near killed me.

553
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:26,279
You hit them?

554
01:16:26,448 --> 01:16:29,474
- Took them prisoner with a gun?
- Yeah.

555
01:16:44,132 --> 01:16:45,724
No, we're still backtracking.

556
01:16:53,075 --> 01:16:55,066
- Keep going.
- Yes, boss.

557
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:22,831
We nearly knocked over
another crazy Bushman.

558
01:17:23,005 --> 01:17:26,441
<i>- You still in Bushmen country?</i>
- It beats me where they come from.

559
01:17:26,608 --> 01:17:30,009
<i>- You said nobody would see you.</i>
- Bushmen don't count.

560
01:17:36,218 --> 01:17:40,018
- Oh, my God.
<i>- Ben, what happened?</i>

561
01:17:40,188 --> 01:17:44,648
- Bloody Bushman was crawling all over.
<i>- What do you mean?</i>

562
01:17:45,794 --> 01:17:49,958
What are you doing? Hey, you okay?
What are you doing?

563
01:17:52,467 --> 01:17:54,196
What are you doing?

564
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:57,131
What were you doing up there?

565
01:17:57,339 --> 01:18:00,172
<i>- Did he see the ivory?</i>
- I don't know. He must have.

566
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:02,674
<i>- Then you can't let him go.</i>
- That's right.

567
01:18:04,146 --> 01:18:05,204
You a game warden?

568
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:08,343
Get him in here.

569
01:18:08,517 --> 01:18:11,350
You come with us. You get in there.

570
01:18:13,722 --> 01:18:14,848
Here.

571
01:18:15,824 --> 01:18:18,224
- Boss?
- Make him get in.

572
01:18:18,393 --> 01:18:21,021
You come with us. You get in there.

573
01:18:21,196 --> 01:18:23,221
You get in there!

574
01:18:23,965 --> 01:18:26,024
You mustn't do that. Get in there.

575
01:18:26,201 --> 01:18:28,101
Can't you do anything right?

576
01:18:29,171 --> 01:18:32,004
- Jeez, boss.
- Get me a tie-down.

577
01:18:34,476 --> 01:18:35,943
What are you gonna do, boss?

578
01:18:36,111 --> 01:18:38,409
So what if it's illegal,
they did it to me.

579
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:41,071
He wants to go that way,
he wants to go that way.

580
01:18:41,249 --> 01:18:43,012
The one with the gun gets to say.

581
01:18:43,185 --> 01:18:46,177
And I've got the gun,
and I say we go to the plane.

582
01:18:46,621 --> 01:18:48,088
Okay.

583
01:18:50,926 --> 01:18:52,188
In the jeep.

584
01:18:53,995 --> 01:18:56,429
When we get there,
you can have your jeep back.

585
01:18:56,598 --> 01:18:58,862
- And my gun.
- We'll see about that.

586
01:19:04,306 --> 01:19:07,639
- What do you think you're doing?
- It's his, boss.

587
01:19:12,881 --> 01:19:14,280
Stop.

588
01:19:15,150 --> 01:19:17,084
Here are those tracks again.

589
01:19:17,819 --> 01:19:19,411
The plane must be that way.

590
01:19:19,588 --> 01:19:22,819
- I'm not gonna be the wheel again.
- Now we can fix it.

591
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:26,588
- I don't see a pump.
- Don't! You've got to watch them.

592
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:34,497
- One of yours?
- No.

593
01:19:34,669 --> 01:19:35,727
Game rangers.

594
01:19:35,904 --> 01:19:39,067
- What are we gonna do?
- Don't let him see the ivory.

595
01:19:39,241 --> 01:19:41,072
Maybe they've got a pump.

596
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:49,740
Could you lend us a pump?

597
01:19:49,918 --> 01:19:51,078
What?

598
01:19:52,687 --> 01:19:54,621
Could we borrow a pump with a...?

599
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:56,087
Oh, no!

600
01:19:58,260 --> 01:19:59,750
What have you done to him?

601
01:20:05,367 --> 01:20:06,561
Drop that!

602
01:20:07,669 --> 01:20:09,296
Throw it away!

603
01:20:12,707 --> 01:20:14,072
George.

604
01:20:14,609 --> 01:20:16,133
Get the gun.

605
01:20:22,884 --> 01:20:25,079
What do we do now, boss?

606
01:20:28,323 --> 01:20:30,154
- Tie them up.
- Boss?

607
01:20:30,325 --> 01:20:31,656
Give me that.

608
01:20:35,530 --> 01:20:37,998
- Get the tie-downs.
- Yes, boss.

609
01:20:38,166 --> 01:20:40,327
- What's this about?
- I don't like game rangers.

610
01:20:40,502 --> 01:20:42,493
- I'm not a game ranger.
- Me too.

611
01:20:43,638 --> 01:20:47,335
- This is all I've got, boss.
- Tie them two by two.

612
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:07,091
What are we gonna do now, boss?

613
01:21:07,262 --> 01:21:09,127
I gotta talk to Ramjee.

614
01:21:16,238 --> 01:21:19,696
Big Ben calling Ramjee.
Do you read me?

615
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:21,866
Ramjee, do you read me?

616
01:21:22,277 --> 01:21:24,336
Out of range again.

617
01:21:24,546 --> 01:21:26,013
George, you see that dome?

618
01:21:27,182 --> 01:21:29,241
I'm gonna go up there to get range.

619
01:21:29,417 --> 01:21:31,749
Got to talk to Ramjee about this.

620
01:21:36,291 --> 01:21:40,193
I'm leaving you in charge.
You watch these people.

621
01:21:56,244 --> 01:22:00,271
Okay, now, you people.
You behave, nobody gets hurt.

622
01:22:16,564 --> 01:22:17,758
Get the gun!

623
01:22:20,969 --> 01:22:24,268
Hey, you mustn't do that.
My boss will kill you!

624
01:22:24,806 --> 01:22:27,639
- Got it.
- Okay, let's go.

625
01:22:29,244 --> 01:22:31,712
- Get in.
- What do you mean, "Get in"?

626
01:22:35,984 --> 01:22:37,349
Move it.

627
01:22:39,087 --> 01:22:40,782
Mister, come with us.

628
01:22:42,157 --> 01:22:45,991
- I'm gonna come too. He's gonna kill me.
- You, give me first gear.

629
01:22:46,928 --> 01:22:48,020
Hurry.

630
01:22:55,136 --> 01:22:59,038
- I told you we're low on gas.
- Let's get out of here.

631
01:23:04,879 --> 01:23:06,471
Move your ass, man.

632
01:23:09,451 --> 01:23:12,284
What a day. Game rangers,
two soldiers and a woman.

633
01:23:12,454 --> 01:23:15,355
<i>- What did you do with them?</i>
- I tied them up.

634
01:23:15,523 --> 01:23:16,751
What the hell?

635
01:23:20,495 --> 01:23:21,792
George!

636
01:23:22,263 --> 01:23:23,753
Yes, boss?

637
01:23:40,582 --> 01:23:41,844
Your turn!

638
01:23:45,186 --> 01:23:46,483
- Your turn!
- No, it's not!

639
01:23:46,654 --> 01:23:48,144
- It is!
- No, it's not!

640
01:23:54,796 --> 01:23:56,423
I'll get the bastard!

641
01:24:27,462 --> 01:24:29,225
No, get up. Untie me.

642
01:24:40,208 --> 01:24:41,436
Come on.

643
01:25:58,353 --> 01:25:59,479
Hey!

644
01:26:04,459 --> 01:26:05,483
Oh, man.

645
01:26:05,860 --> 01:26:08,351
Wait a minute.
He's not so crazy.

646
01:26:09,364 --> 01:26:11,195
He knows what he's doing.

647
01:26:19,674 --> 01:26:22,165
He's making a firebreak.
Clever little bugger.

648
01:26:54,242 --> 01:26:56,403
It'll burn out now.

649
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:03,210
That's it.

650
01:27:07,355 --> 01:27:08,583
They're your kids?

651
01:27:08,756 --> 01:27:12,351
We passed them back there.
There's a tiny one and the other one.

652
01:27:13,361 --> 01:27:14,760
That way.

653
01:27:23,071 --> 01:27:25,130
- Why are you crying?
- He lost his kids.

654
01:27:25,306 --> 01:27:28,036
I told him where to find them.

655
01:27:28,543 --> 01:27:30,875
So you have to disappear again.

656
01:27:34,048 --> 01:27:35,310
Goodbye...

657
01:27:37,719 --> 01:27:39,448
...and thank you.

658
01:27:41,155 --> 01:27:43,123
Goodbye and thank you.

659
01:28:30,104 --> 01:28:32,265
Watch it! He's got a gun!

660
01:28:35,476 --> 01:28:37,603
Out of my way!

661
01:28:41,649 --> 01:28:43,674
- I want you guys to do that again.
- Do what?!

662
01:28:43,851 --> 01:28:45,580
- What you just did.
- What the hell for?

663
01:28:45,787 --> 01:28:48,119
It's a telescopic sight.
He can't hit a moving target.

664
01:28:48,323 --> 01:28:50,018
- No!
- When I say go...

665
01:28:50,191 --> 01:28:52,159
...you run around like crazy. All right?

666
01:28:53,161 --> 01:28:54,856
Go!

667
01:29:05,807 --> 01:29:07,866
Stand still, you bastards.

668
01:29:23,157 --> 01:29:25,125
Throw it away.

669
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:43,367
Okay. Okay. Okay.
I'm your goddamn prisoner.

670
01:29:44,912 --> 01:29:48,370
I don't want you.
You're a shitty prisoner.

671
01:30:05,199 --> 01:30:06,427
Xiri!

672
01:32:24,939 --> 01:32:28,705
- Okay, thank you.
- Okay, goodbye.

673
01:32:40,922 --> 01:32:44,255
Bugger off to Cuba and don't get lost.

674
01:32:48,095 --> 01:32:49,528
See that hill over there?

675
01:32:49,697 --> 01:32:52,222
You head straight for it,
and you'll find your jeep.

676
01:32:57,471 --> 01:32:59,530
Goodbye.

677
01:33:07,982 --> 01:33:10,416
Okay, out.

678
01:33:12,887 --> 01:33:14,548
You drive the jeep.

679
01:33:16,424 --> 01:33:18,949
- Where we going, boss?
- To my base.

680
01:33:19,126 --> 01:33:20,218
How long will we get?

681
01:33:20,394 --> 01:33:25,798
Maybe you'll get a year, but this
bastard's gonna sit for a long time.

682
01:33:36,944 --> 01:33:39,435
There are 12 planes
and 9 helicopters searching...

683
01:33:39,614 --> 01:33:43,914
...in a radius of 400 kilometers.

684
01:33:44,085 --> 01:33:47,111
So we are covering an area of 20,000...

685
01:34:21,689 --> 01:34:23,623
- Isn't this where we kiss?
- Yes.

686
01:34:25,426 --> 01:34:27,860
Pull me up! Pull me up!

687
01:34:28,629 --> 01:34:30,927
You're tearing my dress! Let me down.

688
01:34:31,132 --> 01:34:33,157
No, pull me up.

689
01:34:33,367 --> 01:34:35,198
Don't bother.

690
01:34:35,369 --> 01:34:37,997
I can't see!

691
01:34:40,074 --> 01:34:42,304
Oh, boy.

692
01:34:43,044 --> 01:34:44,443
Now can you do it right?

693
01:34:44,443 --> 01:38:00,000
