3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,464
這個看似樂園的地方 任何人來此...
<i>Anyone else would die of thirst in a few days. In this arid desert...</i>

4
00:00:17,637 --> 00:00:21,300
都會因干渴而死 因為此地沒有地表水
<i>... that looks like a paradise, there's no surface water.</i>

5
00:00:21,474 --> 00:00:24,966
然而瘦長優雅的卡拉哈里土人...
<i>But the slender, graceful Bushmen of the Kalahari...</i>

6
00:00:25,144 --> 00:00:30,275
卻滿足而自在地生活在其中
<i>... live here contentedly and in complete harmony with their environment.</i>

7
00:00:47,832 --> 00:00:51,996
2萬年來過著與世隔絕的生活...
<i>They have lived undisturbed for 20,000 years because they are...</i>

8
00:00:52,169 --> 00:00:57,038
他們是世界上唯一不需要地表的水 而可以生活的人
<i>... the only people in the world who know how to live without surface water.</i>

9
00:00:59,676 --> 00:01:04,375
當外地那些獵象牙的人來這里...
<i>When ivory poachers in high-tech vehicles intrude into this thirst-land...</i>

10
00:01:04,548 --> 00:01:08,951
都得自己帶著飲水來
<i>... to hunt elephant, they have to drag reservoirs of water with them.</i>

11
00:01:09,818 --> 00:01:15,188
當水喝光時便只好開車 離開卡拉哈里沙漠
<i>And when the water runs low they have to hightail it out of the Kalahari again.</i>

12
00:01:18,927 --> 00:01:22,556
土人在自己的世界中 隔絕地生活與嬉戲...
<i>So the Bushmen work and play in peaceful isolation unaware...</i>

13
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:26,063
對外界的汲汲與繁忙一無所知...
<i>... of the crowded, hectic world outside their domain...</i>

14
00:01:26,234 --> 00:01:31,570
即使戰爭也只是在 卡拉哈里的邊緣進行
<i>... and even of the wars that are fought on the very fringes of the Kalahari.</i>

15
00:01:32,973 --> 00:01:37,467
有時奇哥談他出外探險...
<i>Sometimes Xixo tells about the time he looked for the end of the Earth...</i>

16
00:01:37,644 --> 00:01:40,545
遇見的一些奇人異事...
<i>... and about the strange, heavy people he met...</i>

17
00:01:40,714 --> 00:01:44,878
但他很難描述外界的人
<i>... but it's difficult to describe those who live outside the Kalahari.</i>

18
00:01:45,051 --> 00:01:49,112
最后只好說外界的人會變魔術...
<i>He always ends by saying the heavy people know some magic...</i>

19
00:01:49,288 --> 00:01:53,748
讓東西跑或飛，但他們不聰明...
<i>... that can make things move and even fly, but they're not bright...</i>

20
00:01:53,926 --> 00:01:58,124
因為缺了那些東西之后 他們便無法生存
<i>... because they can't survive without their magic contrivances.</i>

21
00:01:58,296 --> 00:02:00,230
他們喜歡在早上閱讀新聞
<i>In the mornings, they like to read the news.</i>

22
00:02:00,465 --> 00:02:03,923
他們知道土狼 有了新的女朋友...
<i>They can read that the hyena has a new girlfriend...</i>

23
00:02:04,102 --> 00:02:09,005
印度豹的孩子不見了 而羚羊又開始向西遷移了
<i>... the cheetah has lost a baby, and the oryx is migrating to the west.</i>

24
00:02:09,174 --> 00:02:14,407
大孩子教小孩子如何去解讀 動物及鄰居的閑話...
<i>Older children teach younger ones how to read the gossip about the animals...</i>

25
00:02:14,578 --> 00:02:19,811
卡拉哈里發生的所有事情 都會印在沙上面
<i>... because everything that happens in the Kalahari gets printed in the sand.</i>

26
00:02:21,085 --> 00:02:26,455
全都印在上面了 你委托人的專利權受到侵犯了
It's all printed out here. This is where they started infringing on the patent.

27
00:02:26,623 --> 00:02:29,023
幫我找出來
Give it to me there.

28
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:35,987
我可以在法庭上提出來 再退回畫面A
Now, that I can present in court. Go back to frame A.

29
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:38,130
看一下銷售圖
And give me sales.

30
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,131
嗨！安，這是杰夫！...

31
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:43,197
凱西，你去處理一下？ 拿掉吧
Cathy, will you take this? Take him off.

32
00:02:44,306 --> 00:02:48,367
單位成本并列表
Now, cost per unit. And a printout on that.

33
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:51,979
杰夫先生說要去香港 處理接收的事
Mr. Geoffrey says he has to go to Hong Kong about the takeover.

34
00:02:52,146 --> 00:02:56,105
- 好的，祝他"旅途愉快" - 他不能參加ECACL的會議
- Tell him, "Have a good flight." - He won't make the ECACI conference.

35
00:02:56,283 --> 00:03:00,014
- 他不能這樣對我 - 他說要你看一下報紙
- He can't do that to me. - He'd like you to read the paper.

36
00:03:00,187 --> 00:03:03,156
說大多數是你研究的 你該得到這份榮幸的
You did the research, so you deserve the honor.

37
00:03:03,324 --> 00:03:06,418
我要在星期三出庭
I have to take this case to court on Wednesday.

38
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,993
- 他說周三前會回來的 - 老天！
- Says you'll be back before Wednesday. - Oh, boy.

39
00:03:11,197 --> 00:03:14,223
當天早上卡比由叢林回來...
<i>That morning, Xabe came with the news that...</i>

40
00:03:14,434 --> 00:03:18,962
說有些動物開始向北遷移
<i>... the animals are moving towards the marula groves in the north.</i>

41
00:03:19,138 --> 00:03:23,131
他對爸爸說："這些野果子 已成熟了，我們去摘吧"
<i>He shouted, "The marulas are ripe. Let's go collect some."</i>

42
00:03:23,308 --> 00:03:27,836
奇沙和奇爾跑過來說： "我們也可以去嗎？"
<i>Xisa and little Xiri ran up and said, "Can we come too?"</i>

43
00:03:29,048 --> 00:03:33,815
奇哥說："我看看你夠不夠大 如果你比我的弓高...
<i>Xixo said, "Let's see if you're big enough. If you're taller than my bow...</i>

44
00:03:34,052 --> 00:03:40,184
土狼就會怕你而遠離你 如果你不夠高，它就會咬你"
<i>... the hyena will be afraid and stay away. If you're shorter, he'll take you."</i>

45
00:03:40,591 --> 00:03:44,357
但奇爾說： "求你也讓我去吧！"
<i>But Xiri said, "Please let me come too."</i>

46
00:03:44,528 --> 00:03:48,396
奇沙說： "我保證一定好好看著他"
<i>And Xisa said, "I promise I'll always stay close to him."</i>

47
00:03:48,565 --> 00:03:52,524
- 今年在哪開會？ - 在艾爾卡卡克拉
- Where is the conference this year? - In Okakarara.

48
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:55,397
- 是尼布拉斯加嗎？ - 不是，是非洲
- Where's that, Nebraska? - No, Africa.

49
00:03:55,572 --> 00:03:57,767
老天！
Oh, boy.

50
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,375
他們摘了好多野果子回來 回家途中看到...
<i>They gathered a lot of marulas and on the way home they found...</i>

51
00:04:08,551 --> 00:04:11,384
一只受傷的大象足跡
<i>... the spoor of a wounded elephant.</i>

52
00:04:18,126 --> 00:04:21,960
奇哥說："這只大象太衰弱了 它會死掉"
<i>Xixo said, "This elephant is very weak. It's going to die."</i>

53
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:25,224
他對奇沙說："你和奇爾回家
<i>He said to Xisa, "You and Xiri can go on home.</i>

54
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:29,893
告訴你媽我找到大象后就回家"
<i>Tell your mother we will come when we've found the sick elephant."</i>

55
00:04:54,493 --> 00:04:58,657
地上有個形狀很奇怪又美麗
<i>There was a very strange and beautiful pattern on the ground.</i>

56
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:03,529
奇沙看不懂 她一輩子也沒看過這種東西
<i>Xisa couldn't read it. She'd never seen anything like it in her life.</i>

57
00:05:03,701 --> 00:05:06,864
還有一個，跟剛才的一樣美
<i>There was another as beautiful as the first.</i>

58
00:05:07,037 --> 00:05:11,974
她想不出是什么東西會有 這種持續的印子
<i>She wondered how anything could make such a long, unbroken track.</i>

59
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,340
她跟著印子走 看見一個很奇怪的東西
<i>She followed the track and saw a very strange-looking thing.</i>

60
00:05:42,103 --> 00:05:44,936
她說： "那個東西一直在轉...
<i>She said, "This thing went round and round...</i>

61
00:05:45,106 --> 00:05:49,406
所以才 造成了這么長的圖案"
<i>... and that's how it made such a long pattern without footprints."</i>

62
00:05:59,553 --> 00:06:03,387
奇爾看到一顆露珠正在凝聚...
<i>Xiri saw a beautiful dewdrop grow, and when it dropped...</i>

63
00:06:03,557 --> 00:06:06,822
掉了一顆，另一顆又快出現了
<i>... another one began to grow in its place.</i>

64
00:06:12,832 --> 00:06:16,632
他們知道上帝在晚上把 露珠放在樹上
<i>They knew the gods put dewdrops on plants in the night.</i>

65
00:06:16,802 --> 00:06:20,898
但現在卻在白天看到露珠
<i>But here they could see a dewdrop form in broad daylight.</i>

66
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:27,573
奇沙說： "水一定是這個東西做的"
<i>Xisa said, "I think this thing is making the water."</i>

67
00:06:54,637 --> 00:06:57,504
奇爾這輩子沒看過這么多水
<i>Xiri had never seen so much water in his life.</i>

68
00:06:57,673 --> 00:07:01,074
他不知道世界上居然有這么多水
<i>He didn't know there was so much water in the whole world.</i>

69
00:07:37,977 --> 00:07:42,641
終于找到大象了 他們看到讓大象死的小傷口
<i>They found the elephant and saw the tiny wounds that had made it die.</i>

70
00:07:42,814 --> 00:07:46,079
這些痕跡讓奇哥知道 是外界的人做的...
<i>The tracks told Xixo the heavy people had been there...</i>

71
00:07:46,251 --> 00:07:50,711
卻納悶他們為何把沒用的象牙 拿走卻把珍貴的肉留下任其腐爛
<i>... but wondered why they took the useless tusks and left the meat to rot.</i>

72
00:07:50,989 --> 00:07:53,514
他說："他們真奇怪"
<i>He said, "The heavy people are strange."</i>

73
00:07:53,691 --> 00:07:57,092
波說："我去叫自己家人來吃肉
<i>Bo said, "I'll call Xabo's family to help us eat it.</i>

74
00:07:57,261 --> 00:08:00,560
即使跑一天一夜 也可在明天找到他們"
<i>If I run all day and night I can find them by tomorrow."</i>

75
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:03,564
奇哥說："我們去叫自己的家人來"
<i>Xixo said, "We'll go call our family."</i>

76
00:08:41,703 --> 00:08:45,799
有好多象牙，上帝需要比人的壽命 還長的時間才能...
<i>There were many tusks. It takes the gods more than a man's lifetime...</i>

77
00:08:45,973 --> 00:08:51,912
讓成象長好，看到這么多 象死掉，讓他們害怕無比
<i>... to make a full-grown elephant, and it horrified them to see so many had died.</i>

78
00:09:00,786 --> 00:09:05,951
奇哥和奇比找到奇沙和奇爾 腳印中斷的地方
<i>Xixo and Xabe found the place where Xisa and Xiri's tracks suddenly stopped.</i>

79
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:11,893
奇哥說："你看，奇沙和 奇爾爬上去被帶走了"
<i>Xixo said, "Xisa climbed onto the thing. Xiri went up too, and it took them away."</i>

80
00:09:12,063 --> 00:09:16,762
他說："回去告訴家人快去吃死象"
<i>He said, "Tell our family they must start eating the dead elephant.</i>

81
00:09:16,935 --> 00:09:18,766
我去找奇沙和奇爾
<i>I'll fetch Xisa and Xiri."</i>

82
00:09:20,705 --> 00:09:24,641
ECACL會議

83
00:09:30,014 --> 00:09:33,245
抱歉臨時通知 不過，很榮幸有你們光臨
Sorry about the short notice, but we're honored to have you.

84
00:09:33,417 --> 00:09:36,011
謝謝你 我也很想去狩獵之旅
Thank you. I would've liked the safari tour...

85
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:39,417
- 可是我要準備報告 - 你當真沒事？
...but I have to prepare my presentation. - You'll be all right?

86
00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:42,854
- 沒事，謝謝你 - 好，那就不打擾了
- I'll be fine, thank you. - Good. I'll leave you to it.

87
00:09:48,831 --> 00:09:53,165
- 史帝芬現在在哪兒？ - 我多少有點概念
- You know where Stephen's working? - I think I've got a rough idea.

88
00:09:53,335 --> 00:09:58,034
- 你得去找一番了 - 對
- You may have to search around a bit. - Right.

89
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,003
- 杰克 - 是的
- And Jack? - Yeah?

90
00:10:00,175 --> 00:10:04,635
跟史帝芬說我們會把 其他東西送去給他
Tell Stephen we'll send the rest of the stuff out to him later.

91
00:10:07,181 --> 00:10:10,878
像你這么好的小姐 怎么會來這里的？
What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?

92
00:10:11,052 --> 00:10:13,680
- 老天 - 你不吃這套？
- Oh, boy. - You don't buy it.

93
00:10:13,854 --> 00:10:16,516
好，我再試一次
Okay, I'll try again.

94
00:10:18,525 --> 00:10:23,462
- 嗨，想不想陪我去飛行？ - 我為了準備這個才拒絕去狩獵的
- Hi. Like to come fly with me? - I have to work. That's why no safari trip.

95
00:10:23,763 --> 00:10:27,859
這一趟要三小時 我半小時內就可以讓你看完非洲
Trip's three hours. I could show you Africa in half an hour.

96
00:10:28,101 --> 00:10:30,035
我三點半要報告的
I have to present this at 3:30.

97
00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:31,736
研討會主講：安泰勒博士

98
00:10:34,973 --> 00:10:37,601
- 只要半小時？ - 是的，博士
- Only half an hour? - Yes, doctor.

99
00:10:40,145 --> 00:10:45,310
- 你是醫學博士？ - 不是，公司法
- So, what are you, a doctor of medicine? - No, corporate law.

100
00:10:45,483 --> 00:10:49,943
- 好小的飛機啊 - 還有更小的，可惜找不到
- What a tiny plane. - We got a smaller one but can't find it.

101
00:10:50,288 --> 00:10:53,416
- 可以飛嗎？ - 進去吧！
- Can it fly? - In you go.

102
00:11:13,109 --> 00:11:15,475
- 那是什么？ - 水牛啊
- What are those? - Buffalo.

103
00:11:23,918 --> 00:11:27,979
看，手可以放掉，自動在飛 最安全的飛機
Look, no hands. Flies by itself. Safest plane in the world.

104
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,990
- 咖啡 - 早安，老板
- Coffee. - Morning, boss.

105
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:46,200
- 才開80哩 - 對呀，我睡了一會

106
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:50,775
- 你停過 - 我太累了，所以停了一會....
- You stopped. - I was bushed. So I pulled up and...

107
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:54,310
- 你睡了四個多小時 - 真的累壞了
- You slept more than four hours. - I was real pooped.

108
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,540
- 我早說過快遲到了 - 我真的好累，老板
- I told you we're late. - I was really pooped, boss.

109
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,714
- 過去點 - 沒關系，精神來了
- Move over. - It's okay, boss. I'm fresh now.

110
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,614
哎呀，老板
Jeez, boss.

111
00:12:10,462 --> 00:12:12,191
懶骨頭
Lazy bastard.

112
00:12:19,436 --> 00:12:21,961
- 回去睡吧 - 我現在清醒的很呢
- Get back to sleep. - I'm wide-awake now.

113
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:25,131
- 睡吧 - 是的，老板
- Sleep. - Yes, boss.

114
00:12:56,504 --> 00:12:58,836
我馬上回來
I'll be right back.

115
00:13:17,424 --> 00:13:19,358
- 嗨！史帝芬 - 嗨！謝謝！
- Hi, Stephen. - Hi. Thanks.

116
00:13:20,026 --> 00:13:23,518
你飛的很好 只是云層會越來越多
You're cutting it fine. There's a hell of a cumulus building up.

117
00:13:23,696 --> 00:13:28,224
萬一被碰上 你就會從2萬英尺摔下來
One of those thermals grabs you, it's gonna whip you right to 20,000 feet.

118

<i>Jack, don't take off yet. There's a freak storm moving in very fast. Over.</i>

130
00:14:43,569 --> 00:14:49,371
- 巴伯，他們剛走，完畢 - 他們？還有別人跟他一起？完畢
<i>- Bob, they've just taken off. Over. - They? Someone is with him? Over.</i>

00:15:09,694 --> 00:15:14,529
奇哥的朋友瓦卡站在那看 外人留下的印子
<i>Xixo's old friend Waka was looking at the tracks the heavy people made.</i>

136
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:20,365

<i>Xixo greeted him and said his children were in the thing that made the tracks.</i>

<i>Waka greeted him back and said, "I'll come with you to find your children."</i>

138
00:15:25,108 --> 00:15:28,544
但奇哥說："那兒有只死大象
<i>But Xixo said, "There's a dead elephant back there.</i>

139
00:15:28,712 --> 00:15:31,840
讓你的家人幫我家人去吃象肉吧"
<i>Go with your family to help my family eat it."</i>

140
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:21,926
高度24987英英尺

141
00:16:22,094 --> 00:16:23,288
高度24991英英尺

142
00:16:29,167 --> 00:16:30,725

143
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:56,815
停了
They stopped.

144
00:16:57,093 --> 00:16:59,823
- 你座位底下有威士忌 - 我沒事
- There's whiskey under your seat. - I'm okay.

145
00:16:59,996 --> 00:17:02,556
- 拿給我喝 - 你要喝酒？
- Give it to me. - You gonna start drinking?

146
00:17:02,732 --> 00:17:04,700
給我！
Give me.

147
00:17:15,777 --> 00:17:18,712
這玩意喝了酒能飛？
Can this thing fly on Scotch?

148
00:17:47,473 --> 00:17:49,202
喬治
George.

149
00:17:49,374 --> 00:17:50,932
老板？
Boss?

150

151
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:02,275

<i>Xisa said, "When this thing gets tired it will rest.</i>

我們可以跟著印子回家"
<i>Then we can follow the tracks back home."</i>

153
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,501
威士忌沒有了
Running out of Scotch.

154
00:18:28,077 --> 00:18:29,408
這有用嗎？
This any good?

155
00:18:39,988 --> 00:18:41,683
我們在倒飛
We're flying backwards.

156
00:19:58,393 --> 00:20:01,988
我三點半要做報告
I have to read my paper at 3:30.

157
00:20:05,467 --> 00:20:10,905
我怎么回去？ 得找路搭便車
How do I get back? We have to find a road so I can hitch a ride.

158
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:18,242
朝哪走最接近公路？
So which way to the nearest road?

159
00:20:18,412 --> 00:20:21,176
- 這里是野蠻區 - 我看得出來
- This is baobab country. - It can speak.

160
00:20:21,381 --> 00:20:24,316
- 距離機場至少3百哩 - 老天！
- We're at least 300 miles from base. - Oh, boy.

161
00:20:24,484 --> 00:20:25,974
可能不止
Maybe more.

162
00:20:36,662 --> 00:20:38,823
- 抱歉 - 隨時候教
- I'm sorry. - Any time.

163
00:20:38,998 --> 00:20:44,493
- 我得去打個電話 - 我連在哪兒都不知道
- I have to get to a phone. - I don't even know what country we're in.

164
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:46,431
嘿！
Hey!

165
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:50,265
- 什么！ - 他們不怕我
- What? - They're not scared of me.

166
00:20:50,441 --> 00:20:52,602
- 如何？ - 他們不知道人這種東西
- So? - They don't know about people.

167
00:20:52,777 --> 00:20:55,143
- 我們在卡拉哈里內部 - 他們會找到我們嗎？
- We're in the deep Kalahari. - Will they find us?

168
00:20:55,413 --> 00:20:58,177
- 遲早的事 - 究竟要多久？
- Eventually. - How long is eventually?

169
00:20:58,349 --> 00:21:01,216
也許是一天，也許是一星期
Maybe a day, maybe a week.

170
00:21:01,418 --> 00:21:04,353
一星期？我周三要回紐約
I have to be back in New York on Wednesday.

171
00:21:04,521 --> 00:21:07,718
- 你從紐約來？ - 你要我在這過一星期？
- You're from New York? - I have to survive here for a week?

172
00:21:07,991 --> 00:21:10,858
能在紐約活在這就死不了
Anyone who can survive in New York can survive here.

173
00:21:11,028 --> 00:21:14,964
- 我們會餓死 - 這兒有吃不完的食物
- We'll starve to death. - There's enough food around here.

174
00:21:15,197 --> 00:21:19,998
水才是問題 我們只有那些啤酒
Our problem will be water. All we have is that six-pack up there.

175
00:21:28,043 --> 00:21:32,810
他們很渴 但知道那兒有水
<i>They were getting thirsty, but they knew where there was plenty of water.</i>

176
00:22:20,591 --> 00:22:23,185
她說："我太重了拉不上來
<i>She said, "No, I'm too heavy to pull up.</i>

177
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,262
你下來推我好了 然后我再拉你上來"
<i>Come down here so you can push me up. Then I can pull you up."</i>

178
00:22:36,873 --> 00:22:39,637
奇爾一輩子沒下過水...
<i>Xiri had never been in water in his life...</i>

179
00:22:39,809 --> 00:22:43,210
但很快就習慣而喜歡上
<i>... but soon got used to it and quite enjoyed it.</i>

180
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:48,245
是水嗎？
Is that water?

181
00:22:48,417 --> 00:22:50,908
- 汽油，燃料 - 怎么樣？
- Petrol. Gas. - So?

182
00:22:51,153 --> 00:22:54,020
如果能把飛機弄下來 就可以開了
If I can get this down, we can fly out.

183
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:55,756
今天？
Today?

184
00:22:55,924 --> 00:22:59,257
我得拆開拿下來再裝配好
I have to take it apart, bring it down, assemble it again.

185
00:22:59,527 --> 00:23:04,294
- 終于！ - 可能明天會好或后天
- Eventually. - Maybe by tomorrow, the next day.

186
00:23:05,399 --> 00:23:07,162
是獅子嗎？
Was that a lion?

187
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:12,628
- 我聽到了 - 繩子放下，我要上去
- I can hear them. - Let down the rope. I want to get up.

188
00:23:13,106 --> 00:23:15,438
- 它們不會來的 - 你沒關系
- They won't bother us. - You're okay.

189
00:23:15,609 --> 00:23:20,444
- 我在下面呀 - 它們不會過來的
- They're bothering me down here. - They're not coming this way.

190
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,147
萬一呢？
What about eventually?

191
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:25,847
你不惹它們，它們就不惹你
Don't bother them, they won't bother you.

192
00:23:26,619 --> 00:23:30,953
- 如果它們餓了呢？ - 它們離這里很遠
- And if they're hungry? - They're far from here.

193
00:23:37,862 --> 00:23:39,796
下面全是野獸
It's swarming with wild animals here.

194
00:23:39,964 --> 00:23:41,989
別惹它們就不會有事
Don't bother them, they won't bother you.

195
00:23:42,267 --> 00:23:44,599
我沒惹它們呀
I'm not bothering them.

196
00:23:49,007 --> 00:23:51,271
這一只在垂涎我
This one is drooling at me.

197
00:23:51,441 --> 00:23:55,502
- 是土狼，本來就流口水 - 所以呢？
- It's a hyena. They're always drooling. - So?

198
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,342
別管它，別對它笑 它看見你的牙齒...
Ignore him. Don't smile at him. He sees your teeth...

199
00:23:59,516 --> 00:24:03,384
- 會認為你在威脅它 - 讓我上去
...he might think you're threatening him. - Let me get up.

200
00:24:11,394 --> 00:24:14,022
- 你很享受呀 - 對
- You're enjoying this. - Yeah.

201
00:24:14,197 --> 00:24:17,166
- 為什么你不放輕松也享受一下？ - 享受？
- Why don't you relax and enjoy it too? - Enjoy?

202
00:24:17,399 --> 00:24:22,166
- 這么多野獸，沒食物也沒水 - 也沒房間服務
- Wild animals, no food, no water. - No room service.

203
00:24:22,404 --> 00:24:25,703
對，也沒衛浴 我現在需要衛浴
Yeah, no plumbing. What I need is plumbing. Now.

204
00:24:25,974 --> 00:24:29,910
- 到樹叢后面 - 一個人？獅子在那邊呀
- Go behind that thicket. - Alone? The lions are that way.

205
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:35,548
- 它們在很遠，如果你不惹- - - 它們就沒事，我知道了
- They're very far. If you don't bother... - They won't bother me. I know, I know.

206
00:24:39,987 --> 00:24:43,320
- 怎么下去啊？ - 怎么上去的？
- How do I get down? - How'd you get up there?

207
00:24:43,489 --> 00:24:46,219
- 獅子吼的 - 不是獅子
- The lion was roaring. - Wasn't a lion.

208
00:24:46,392 --> 00:24:48,724
是土狼在叫
It was a hyena sounding off.

209
00:24:51,397 --> 00:24:53,558
對
Right.

210
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:58,026
等一下，轉過去
Now, just a minute. Turn your back.

211
00:24:59,071 --> 00:25:01,232
- 拉起來 - 不行，有阻力
- Pull me up. - I can't. Friction.

212
00:25:01,406 --> 00:25:02,896
放我下來
Then let me down.

213
00:25:03,175 --> 00:25:05,336
- 停 - 你要我怎么做？
- Stop. - What do you want me to do?

214
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:08,707
- 別看我 - 我沒看你，你要我怎么做？
- Don't look at me. - I'm not. What do you want me to do?

215
00:25:08,881 --> 00:25:10,371
放下來
Let me down.

216
00:25:21,092 --> 00:25:23,686
什么好笑的？
What's so funny?

217
00:25:36,772 --> 00:25:40,868
好吧，我不打擾你 你也別打擾我
Okay, I won't bother you, see? So don't you bother me.

218
00:25:43,545 --> 00:25:45,809
- 小心！ - 快走開
- Watch it! - Go away!

219
00:25:46,081 --> 00:25:49,175
快跑，快跑... 爬到樹上
Run, run, run, run, run, run. Get up a tree!

220
00:25:54,756 --> 00:25:55,984
你沒事吧？
You okay?

221
00:25:57,091 --> 00:26:02,051
- 你說只要不惹它們.... - 有小犀牛在呀
- You said if I didn't bother them... - I see there's a baby rhino.

222
00:26:02,229 --> 00:26:04,663
母牛以為你在騷擾它
Maybe the mother thought you were molesting it.

223
00:26:04,831 --> 00:26:08,096
我只跟它說話而已 沒有對它微笑
I only talked to it. I didn't even smile at it.

224
00:26:08,335 --> 00:26:10,997
- 它們會走開 - 你不飛...
- They're going away. - I'm not coming down...

225
00:26:11,204 --> 00:26:15,573
- 我出去之前我不下來 - 上面沒衛浴呀
...before you can fly me out of here. - There's no plumbing up there.

226
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:38,696
- 你渴了？ - 對！
- You thirsty? - Yes.

227
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:42,128
- 來，半罐啤酒給你 - 太好了
- Right, you can have half a beer. - Great.

228
00:26:42,366 --> 00:26:45,494
- 先別打開 - 抱歉，噢，老天！
- Don't open it yet. - Sorry. Oh, my goodness.

229
00:26:51,442 --> 00:26:54,309
抱歉，我哪做錯了？
Sorry. What did I do wrong?

230
00:26:54,811 --> 00:26:58,804
是溫的，喝了吧
Well, it's warm. Drink it now.

231
00:27:02,819 --> 00:27:05,481
好，時間不早了
Right. It's getting late.

232
00:27:06,022 --> 00:27:11,187
趁天黑前找食物吧 我看見鴕鳥巢
We have to find food before it gets dark. I saw an ostrich nest.

233
00:27:37,183 --> 00:27:41,017
- 會咬人嗎？ - 不會，它們會踢人，但不太聰明
- Do they bite? - No, they kick. But they aren't bright.

234
00:27:41,187 --> 00:27:45,681
只要躺著，它就看不見了 那只是公的，它在監視蛋
You lie down flat, he can't see you. That's the male. He guards the eggs.

235
00:27:45,925 --> 00:27:51,056
- 如果你引開公鴕鳥.... - 如何引開公鴕鳥？
- But if you can distract him... - How do I distract a male ostrich?

236
00:28:50,785 --> 00:28:53,083
躺下
Lie down flat!

237
00:29:52,976 --> 00:29:56,036
奇哥以為自己看見了孩子的腳印...
<i>Xixo thought he saw his children's footprints...</i>

238
00:29:56,212 --> 00:29:59,045
但其實是一只猩猩的
<i>... but it was only a baboon that had walked past.</i>

239
00:30:40,452 --> 00:30:44,183
- 怎么回事？ - 沒事！蛋拿到了
- So, what went wrong? - Nothing. We got the egg.

240
00:30:44,356 --> 00:30:47,655
這是標準做法？
You mean that was standard procedure?

241
00:30:48,561 --> 00:30:50,188

373
00:55:53,716 --> 00:55:58,449
我不會替你這些親朋好友澆水的- -
I'm not gonna water you, your friends and your relatives, and I'm not...

374
00:56:39,524 --> 00:56:42,857
- 日內瓦會議摘要 - 算了吧！
- Excerpts from the Geneva Convention. - Forget it.

375
00:56:43,028 --> 00:56:45,997
上面提到對待戰俘的方法
How a prisoner of war ought to be treated.

376
00:56:46,164 --> 00:56:49,861
"戰犯不得受到非人道的待遇
"No prisoner shall be subjected to inhumane treatment.

377

378
00:56:53,137 --> 00:56:56,538
- 你可以休息3分鐘了 - 你怎么這么急？
- You can rest for three minutes. - What's your hurry?

379
00:56:56,707 --> 00:56:58,698
不關你的事
None of your business.

380
00:57:06,416 --> 00:57:07,849
3分鐘
Three minutes.

381
00:57:08,818 --> 00:57:10,683
我累死了
I'm pooped, man.

382
00:57:15,992 --> 00:57:22,295
別跑啊，回來！我要把你 呈報到日內瓦會議
Don't do that. Come back. I'm going to report you to the Geneva Convention!

383
00:57:22,531 --> 00:57:25,728
回來，你是人犯，回來
Come back. You're my prisoner. Come back!

384
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:34,309
回到我這兒來，你是我的人犯
Come out of there and be my prisoner!

385
00:57:40,848 --> 00:57:44,340
- 你不能這么做！ - 前進
- You mustn't do that! - March.

386
00:57:49,356 --> 00:57:53,884
如果你聰明，怎么會連 身處在什么國家都不知道？
If you're so smart, how come you don't even know what country you're in?

387
00:57:56,029 --> 00:57:57,997
他們朝哪走了呢？
So which way did they go?

388
00:58:01,233 --> 00:58:04,361
看來只好等他們回來了
I'll just have to wait till they come back.

389
00:58:11,109 --> 00:58:14,340
奇哥看見外人穿怪衣服...
<i>Xixo saw a heavy person dressed in funny clothes...</i>

390
00:58:14,512 --> 00:58:19,540
自言自語 她看來像女人，但是男人聲
<i>... talking to herself. She looked like a woman, but had a man's voice.</i>

391
00:58:26,423 --> 00:58:27,856
嘿
Hey.

392
00:58:31,562 --> 00:58:35,999
這是你問好的方式 我們是這種做法
It's your way of greeting. We do it this way.

393
00:58:38,101 --> 00:58:39,591
抱歉
Sorry.

394
00:58:40,269 --> 00:58:42,260
好吧，照你的方式做
Okay. I'll do it your way.

395
00:58:43,039 --> 00:58:45,507
哈啰，很高興認識你
Hello. I'm very glad to meet you.

396
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:52,377
他說："你的家人在哪？"
<i>He said, "Where is your family?"</i>

397
00:58:52,948 --> 00:58:56,645
他看了一下印子說 "你一個人怎么來的呢？
<i>He looked at her tracks and said, "How did you get here?</i>

398
00:58:56,818 --> 00:59:01,152
我得找我的孩子 但有兩個外人在那玩游戲
<i>I have to find my children, but two people are playing some game.</i>

399
00:59:01,323 --> 00:59:03,553
剛才聽見他們朝這兒來了
<i>They went that way. I hear them.</i>

400
00:59:03,758 --> 00:59:07,285
- 或許他們會讓你一起玩" - 要我一起去？
<i>- Perhaps they'll let you play." - You want me to go?</i>

401
00:59:24,611 --> 00:59:27,580
他帶她去兩個外人的所在
<i>He showed her the tracks where he met the two heavy men.</i>

402
00:59:27,747 --> 00:59:30,079
說這是他們回頭的地方
<i>He said, "This is where they turned back.</i>

403
00:59:30,349 --> 00:59:34,342
這個人很生氣，因為累的那個人 搶了他的棍子
<i>This one was angry because the tired one grabbed the stick.</i>

404
00:59:34,586 --> 00:59:37,453
然后他得逃跑，真好笑
<i>And then he had to run. It was very funny."</i>

405
00:59:38,056 --> 00:59:41,958
她當然聽不懂了，她也很文盲
<i>She couldn't understand. She was also quite illiterate.</i>

406
00:59:42,127 --> 00:59:45,494
她看不懂符號和印子
<i>She couldn't read the signs and tracks at all.</i>

407
00:59:55,339 --> 00:59:57,330
我們等巴士？
We're waiting for a bus?

408
01:00:02,979 --> 01:00:04,674
真想不到呀
Well, what do you know.

409
01:00:15,958 --> 01:00:19,826
走，滾，我不想看到你 停！
Go away. Bugger off. I don't want to see you. Stop!

410
01:00:20,029 --> 01:00:21,656
你是誰？
Who are you?

411
01:00:28,303 --> 01:00:31,739
奇哥不明白那些瘋子玩什么把戲
<i>Xixo couldn't understand what they were playing.</i>

412
01:00:31,906 --> 01:00:33,737
這玩意會穿透的
This thing penetrates.

413
01:00:33,908 --> 01:00:36,604
你不會傷害女人吧？
You wouldn't shoot a lady.

414
01:00:36,810 --> 01:00:39,335
他說："我得去找孩子"
<i>He said, "I have to find my children."</i>

415
01:00:39,546 --> 01:00:42,913
他記得那些人態度很差 所以也沒說再見
<i>The men had bad manners, so he didn't say goodbye.</i>

416
01:00:43,116 --> 01:00:46,415
我不想涉及你們的爭端 我是美國人
I don't want to be involved. I'm American.

417
01:00:46,620 --> 01:00:47,917
好吧！
Okay.

418
01:00:50,223 --> 01:00:54,683
嘿，不能丟下我不管 你要我死嗎？
Hey, you can't leave me here. You want me to die?

419
01:00:58,030 --> 01:00:59,725
離我遠點
Get away from me.

420
01:01:03,034 --> 01:01:04,626
走開
Get away.

421
01:01:05,937 --> 01:01:07,871
再一次？
Try again, huh?

422
01:01:15,579 --> 01:01:18,241
這不公平，你們不能利用我
It's not fair. You can't both use me.

423
01:01:18,415 --> 01:01:22,374
放開我！放開我！放開我！
Let me go! Let me go. Let me go!

424
01:01:24,688 --> 01:01:26,713
好了，丟掉
Okay, drop it.

425
01:01:27,191 --> 01:01:29,853
- 丟掉 - 丟掉
- Drop it. - Yes, drop it.

426
01:01:33,096 --> 01:01:36,395
- 丟掉 - 丟掉，丟掉，丟掉！
- Now, drop it. - Yes, drop it, drop it, drop it!

427
01:01:40,670 --> 01:01:42,228
可以談判嗎？
Can't we negotiate?

428
01:01:42,404 --> 01:01:47,432
我要回家，如果明天不到比耶 就趕不上回古巴的飛機了
I wanna go home. If I don't get back to Biera, I'll miss my plane to Cuba.

429
01:01:47,676 --> 01:01:52,443
- 不然又要在非洲過6個月 - 我要帶你回基地
- I'll spend another six months here. - I've got to take you to my base!

430
01:01:52,681 --> 01:01:57,175
- 我得趕在周三回紐約 - 坐下來，離那個古巴佬遠點
- I must be in New York on Wednesday. - Sit down. And stay clear of the Cuban.

431
01:01:57,418 --> 01:01:59,579
我要離你們兩個遠點
I'll stay clear of goddamn both of you.

432
01:01:59,754 --> 01:02:02,689
我討厭被人利用當人質
I resent being used as a hostage object.

433
01:02:03,257 --> 01:02:05,191
我得在周三回紐約
Gotta be in New York on Wednesday.

434
01:02:06,427 --> 01:02:10,796
你該留在這 我沒叫你出來的
You should have stayed there. I didn't ask you to come out here.

435
01:02:10,964 --> 01:02:13,228
為了找你，腿都快斷了
I have to walk my arse off to find you.

436
01:02:16,236 --> 01:02:18,500
很好
Well, good.

437
01:02:21,974 --> 01:02:23,339
什么好笑的？
What's so funny?

438
01:02:32,451 --> 01:02:33,918
打開
Switch it on.

439
01:02:35,219 --> 01:02:38,620
大班呼叫藍吉 大班呼叫藍吉
Big Ben calling Ramjee. Big Ben calling Ramjee.

440
01:02:38,790 --> 01:02:40,690
- 你干什么？ - 我干什么？老板
- What are you doing? - What am I doing?

441
01:02:40,858 --> 01:02:43,190
看看太陽，方向走錯了
Look at the sun. You're going the wrong way.

442
01:02:43,361 --> 01:02:45,522
老板，我照羅盤開的呀
Boss, I'm driving on the compass.

443
01:02:45,730 --> 01:02:49,666
這玩意是鋼做的 你卻留在那
This thing is made of steel. You left it there.

444
01:02:49,833 --> 01:02:51,494
看看針
Look at the needle.

445
01:02:52,135 --> 01:02:54,535
你把羅盤弄壞了，笨蛋
You buggered the compass, you stupid bastard.

446
01:02:54,738 --> 01:02:58,538
- 對不起，我沒想到，真的- - - 卡車停下
- Jeez, boss, I wasn't thinking. I'm real... - Stop the bloody truck.

447
01:03:16,391 --> 01:03:18,018
何時放在那的？
So when did you put it there?

448
01:03:18,193 --> 01:03:22,459
我天亮時喝的咖啡
Well, I drank some coffee just at sunrise, boss.

449
01:03:22,630 --> 01:03:27,397
偏離了5小時，40度 你這個笨蛋！
Five hours. Forty degrees off. Stupid bastard.

450
01:03:29,403 --> 01:03:33,339
大班呼叫藍吉，大班呼叫藍吉 聽到沒有？拜托
Big Ben calling Ramjee. Do you read me, for chrissakes?

451
01:03:34,174 --> 01:03:38,133
- 藍吉，快回答 - 大班，你在哪？
<i>- Ramjee, come in. - Big Ben, where the hell are you?</i>

452
01:03:39,579 --> 01:03:42,343
抱歉，這個白癡把羅盤弄壞了
Look, I'm sorry. This idiot bugged the compass.

453
01:03:42,515 --> 01:03:46,178
我等了三天整，你去哪了？
<i>I've been waiting three bloody days! Where the bloody hell are you?</i>

454
01:03:46,352 --> 01:03:49,014
本來我們早就到了 現在偏離方向了
We could have been there, but we're way off course.

455
01:03:49,188 --> 01:03:53,215
我們要花5小時才能走回原路
Now we have to backtrack for at least five hours to find our bearings.

456
01:04:09,306 --> 01:04:12,707
又回原路了，可能在連絡范圍外
We're going back in our tracks, so we'll be out of range again.

457
01:04:12,877 --> 01:04:16,074
等進入范圍再連絡你
I'll contact you when we come back into range.

458
01:04:32,261 --> 01:04:35,025
小奇爾看見土狼足跡
<i>Little Xiri saw hyena tracks.</i>

459
01:04:37,833 --> 01:04:41,929
足跡是剛采的 他知道土狼在附近
<i>The spoor was very fresh so he knew the hyena must be close.</i>

460
01:04:43,372 --> 01:04:46,933
而且是下風，它一定會聞到
<i>And it was downwind, so it was sure to smell him.</i>

461
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:09,926
他想父親的話...
<i>He remembered his father had said:</i>

462
01:05:10,097 --> 01:05:13,726
"只要你個頭比它大，它就會離開"
<i>"If you're taller than the hyena, it will keep its distance."</i>

463
01:05:19,672 --> 01:05:23,768
土狼不明白這個傢伙 怎么突然變高了
<i>It couldn't understand how this small creature had grown tall so suddenly.</i>

464
01:05:38,288 --> 01:05:42,315
或許土狼希望奇爾再變小 所以就跟著來了
<i>Perhaps the hyena hoped that Xiri would get small again, so it followed...</i>

465
01:05:42,493 --> 01:05:44,256
但保持著適當的距離
<i>... at a respectful distance.</i>

466
01:05:54,704 --> 01:05:57,935
我們的飛機被吹來這...
Well, we got flown here in a kind of a plane...

467
01:05:58,107 --> 01:06:00,541
然后我就找不到馬歇爾博士了
...and then I kind of lost Dr. Marshall.

468
01:06:02,044 --> 01:06:05,013
上吉普車，快！
Get in the jeep. Move.

469
01:06:08,617 --> 01:06:10,016
在那等
Wait there.

470
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:14,445
- 好，袋子留著 - 為什么？
- Okay, but leave your bag. - Why?

471
01:06:14,623 --> 01:06:17,114
- 你會打人 - 不會，我保證不會
- You swat people. - No, I won't. I promise.

472
01:06:17,291 --> 01:06:20,624
- 我把石頭拿出來 - 你把石頭放在里面？
- Look, I'll take out the rocks. - You got rocks in there?

473
01:06:22,830 --> 01:06:24,297
你開車
You drive.

474
01:06:27,701 --> 01:06:28,963
上車
In there.

475
01:06:33,473 --> 01:06:35,202
發動
Start her up.

476
01:06:37,177 --> 01:06:38,508
往那走
That way.

477
01:06:51,757 --> 01:06:54,920
奇哥看見另一個外人的足跡...
<i>Xixo saw another track made by a heavy person...</i>

478
01:06:55,093 --> 01:06:58,324
由腳印判斷是一個情況不好的人
<i>... and the footprints told of a man who was in a bad way.</i>

479
01:06:58,496 --> 01:06:59,929
他對腳印說：
<i>He spoke to the track:</i>

480
01:07:00,097 --> 01:07:03,498
"我知道你需要幫忙 不過我得先找孩子"
<i>"I can see you need help but I must find my children."</i>

481
01:07:17,881 --> 01:07:19,246
向右轉
Turn right.

482
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:21,876
停
Stop.

483
01:07:22,052 --> 01:07:23,781
嘿，是我的吉普
Hey, that's my jeep.

484
01:07:24,086 --> 01:07:25,576
我知道，早知道了
I know, I knew it.

485
01:07:28,090 --> 01:07:30,058
- 去吸油 - 汽油？
- Go siphon. - Gas?

486
01:07:30,226 --> 01:07:32,194
但我的油箱是空的
But my tank was almost empty.

487
01:07:33,729 --> 01:07:35,026
要命！
Oh, boy.

488
01:07:54,414 --> 01:07:55,574
嗨！
Hi.

489
01:07:59,786 --> 01:08:02,152
奇哥說："我不知該怎么辦
<i>Xixo said, "I don't know what to do.</i>

490
01:08:02,321 --> 01:08:06,553
你需要有人找水給你 不過我擔心自己的孩子
<i>You need someone to find water for you, but I'm worried about my children.</i>

491
01:08:06,726 --> 01:08:10,162
我走了兩天兩夜 還沒找到呢
<i>I've been running for two days, and I haven't found them.</i>

492
01:08:10,329 --> 01:08:12,889
我想他們可能在很遠"
<i>I think they're very far."</i>

493
01:08:22,907 --> 01:08:24,534
有多少？
What have you got?

494
01:08:25,076 --> 01:08:26,566
大約兩公升
About two liters.

495
01:08:26,745 --> 01:08:28,940
14，15公里
Fourteen, 15 kilometers.

496
01:08:29,113 --> 01:08:31,741
- 里面還有多少？ - 還可跑20公里
- How much have you got in here? - 20 kilometers.

497
01:08:31,915 --> 01:08:34,611
- 你基地多遠？ - 60，65公里
- And how far is your base? - Sixty, 65.

498
01:08:34,785 --> 01:08:35,911
老天
Oh, my God.

499
01:08:36,086 --> 01:08:38,281
- 我的基地才20公里 - 閉嘴！
- My base is only 20 kilometers. - Shut up.

叫你住手
I said, stop it!

504
01:08:55,437 --> 01:08:56,995
馬上住手
Stop it right now!

505
01:09:06,315 --> 01:09:08,510
小姐，這玩意得小心
Lady, be careful with that thing.

506
01:09:08,683 --> 01:09:10,173
- 給我吧 - 我不要
- Give it to me. - I won't.

507
01:09:10,351 --> 01:09:12,945
我是好人呀 他是臭古巴佬
But I'm the good guy here. He's a bloody Cuban.

508
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:14,178
給我吧！

好吧，小姐 我基地只有20公里
<i>Okay, se駉rita. My base is only 20 kilometers away.</i>

512
01:09:23,596 --> 01:09:25,826
明天有班機去古巴

513
01:09:25,999 --> 01:09:29,332
- 我送你去 - 這小子不知道這是哪兒
- I'll take you there. - This guy doesn't know where he is.

514
01:09:29,502 --> 01:09:33,905
- 你如何找基地？ - 你找的到，你很聰明
- How are you going to find your base? - You can find it. You're so smart.

515
01:09:34,106 --> 01:09:36,165
- 去我的基地 - 誰說的？
- We're going to my base. - Who says?

516
01:09:36,342 --> 01:09:37,866
- 我說的 - 住口！
- I says! - Stop it!

517
01:09:43,882 --> 01:09:46,407
你，給我上車
You, get behind the wheel.

518
01:09:46,618 --> 01:09:47,744
不
No.

519
01:09:48,486 --> 01:09:52,013
不行，退回去 你們得在一起
No, get back. You gotta stay together.

520
01:09:54,125 --> 01:09:55,752
牽他的手
Take his hand.

521
01:09:59,364 --> 01:10:01,264
我叫你牽手
I said hold hands!

522
01:10:06,269 --> 01:10:07,634
好了，過來
Okay, get in.

523
01:10:13,843 --> 01:10:16,073
你繞過那邊
You go around that way.

524
01:10:24,186 --> 01:10:25,448
好的
Okay.

525
01:10:26,521 --> 01:10:29,957
- 現在你們誰能開飛機？ - 我能！
- Now, can either of you fly a plane? - Yeah, I can.

526
01:10:30,358 --> 01:10:32,952
好，開回原來的地方
Good. Drive back to where we started.

527
01:10:52,678 --> 01:10:54,111
小心！老板
Watch it, boss!

528
01:10:58,951 --> 01:11:00,976
糟了，老板，壓死一個小孩
Jeez, boss, we killed a little kid.

529
01:11:01,187 --> 01:11:05,180
- 坐下，我們得離開 - 但老板，他是個小孩子呀！
- Sit down. We've got to get out of here. - But, boss, it was a little kid.

530
01:11:12,764 --> 01:11:14,197
他沒事
He's okay.

531
01:12:39,677 --> 01:12:41,804
- 老板，還有一個 - 王八蛋
- Jeez, there's another one. - Bugger.

532
01:12:44,816 --> 01:12:47,341
奇爾！奇爾！
Xiri! Xiri!

奇爾！奇爾！

534
01:12:52,089 --> 01:12:54,250
奇沙不知該去哪
<i>Now Xisa didn't know which way to go.</i>

535
01:12:54,424 --> 01:12:57,359
萬一弟弟一個人被留在后面呢？
<i>What if her little brother had been left back there?</i>

536
01:13:15,244 --> 01:13:16,609
停車
Stop here.

537
01:13:18,446 --> 01:13:20,175
土人在這兒找到我的
This is where the Bushman found me.

538
01:13:20,348 --> 01:13:24,250
這表示飛機一定....
That means the plane must be...

539
01:13:30,024 --> 01:13:31,855
這小子掃把星
That guy's only bad news.

540
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:41,761
- 跟他去 - 汽油不夠了
- Follow him. - We're low on gas.

541
01:13:41,936 --> 01:13:43,426
- 跟他去 - 汽油不夠
- Follow him. - We low on gas.

542
01:13:43,603 --> 01:13:45,070
跟去
Follow him.

543
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:46,388
嗨！
Hi.

544
01:14:48,696 --> 01:14:50,095
手握起來！
Hold hands.

545
01:14:53,501 --> 01:14:55,128
從那邊下車
Get out that side.

546
01:14:57,972 --> 01:14:59,496
去那邊
Go that way.

547
01:15:01,709 --> 01:15:03,040
停！
Stop.

548
01:15:06,647 --> 01:15:08,842
再見，謝謝
Goodbye, thank you.

549
01:15:09,783 --> 01:15:11,182
怎么了？
What happened?

550
01:15:11,351 --> 01:15:14,980
沒事！只是脫水罷了
It's nothing, just kind of dehydrated.

551
01:15:22,561 --> 01:15:26,429
- W代表水嗎？ - 我不必告訴你
- Does W stand for water? - I don't have to tell you.

552
01:15:37,242 --> 01:15:39,301
嘴張開
Okay, open your mouth.

553
01:15:47,751 --> 01:15:49,685
把我埋在這的人是誰？
Who's the little guy who gave me that stuff?

554
01:15:49,853 --> 01:15:53,846
不知道，他神出鬼沒的
I don't know. He just keeps on appearing and disappearing.

555
01:15:57,560 --> 01:16:00,358
- 他們是誰？ - 是士兵
- Who are they? - They're soldiers.

556
01:16:01,197 --> 01:16:04,223
他們看起來很親密
They look very affectionate.

557
01:16:05,101 --> 01:16:06,500
不對！
No.

558
01:16:08,370 --> 01:16:10,497
- 是你的囚犯？ - 差不多
- Are they your prisoners? - Kind of.

559
01:16:10,672 --> 01:16:14,199
是人質，她搶了我的吉普 又綁架我們
We're hostages. She hijacked my jeep and she kidnapped us.

560
01:16:14,376 --> 01:16:18,107
是你先動武的！你們倆 他有，他也有
You did it to me first! Both of them. He did it and then he did it.

561
01:16:18,346 --> 01:16:20,507
- 她先打我的 - 你打他？
- She hit me first. - You hit him?

562
01:16:21,582 --> 01:16:24,847
- 對 - 她也打我，差點要我命
- Yeah. - She hit me too. Damn near killed me.

563
01:16:25,019 --> 01:16:26,418
你打了他們？
You hit them?

564
01:16:26,587 --> 01:16:29,613
- 用槍劫持他們？ - 對
- Took them prisoner with a gun? - Yeah.

565
01:16:44,270 --> 01:16:45,862
我們還是在走回頭路
No, we're still backtracking.

566
01:16:53,212 --> 01:16:55,203
- 繼續走 - 老板
- Keep going. - Yes, boss.

567
01:17:20,771 --> 01:17:22,966
差點又壓死一個土人
We nearly knocked over another crazy Bushman.

568
01:17:23,140 --> 01:17:26,576
- 你還在蠻荒國度？ - 哪兒來的都不知道
<i>- You still in Bushmen country? - It beats me where they come from.</i>

569
01:17:26,742 --> 01:17:30,143
- 你說不會有人看見你的 - 土人不算
<i>- You said nobody would see you. - Bushmen don't count.</i>

570
01:17:36,352 --> 01:17:40,152
- 老天 - 班，怎么回事？
<i>- Oh, my God. - Ben, what happened?</i>

571
01:17:40,321 --> 01:17:44,781
- 土人爬到車上 - 什么意思？
<i>- Bloody Bushman was crawling all over. - What do you mean?</i>

572
01:17:45,927 --> 01:17:50,091
你干什么？還好吧？ 還好吧？
What are you doing? Hey, you okay? What are you doing?

573
01:17:52,599 --> 01:17:54,328
你干什么？
What are you doing?

574
01:17:55,636 --> 01:17:57,263
在上面干什么？
What were you doing up there?

575
01:17:57,471 --> 01:18:00,304
- 你有沒有看見象牙？ - 不知道，他一定有
<i>- Did he see the ivory? - I don't know. He must have.</i>

576
01:18:00,474 --> 01:18:02,806
- 不能放他走 - 沒錯
<i>- Then you can't let him go. - That's right.</i>

577
01:18:04,278 --> 01:18:05,336
你是監獵員
You a game warden?

578
01:18:06,813 --> 01:18:08,474
抓上來
Get him in here.

579
01:18:08,648 --> 01:18:11,481
你上車跟我們來，上車
You come with us. You get in there.

580
01:18:13,853 --> 01:18:14,979
拿去
Here.

581
01:18:15,955 --> 01:18:18,355
- 老板？ - 逼他上車
- Boss? - Make him get in.

582
01:18:18,524 --> 01:18:21,152
上車跟我們走，你上車
You come with us. You get in there.

583
01:18:21,326 --> 01:18:23,351
你上車！
You get in there!

584
01:18:24,095 --> 01:18:26,154
不能這么做，上車
You mustn't do that. Get in there.

585
01:18:26,331 --> 01:18:28,231
你什么都做不好
Can't you do anything right?

586
01:18:29,301 --> 01:18:32,134
- 老板 - 把他綁起來
- Jeez, boss. - Get me a tie-down.

587
01:18:34,605 --> 01:18:36,072
你打算怎么做，老板？
What are you gonna do, boss?

588
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:38,538
這么做是非法的又怎樣 是他們先的
So what if it's illegal, they did it to me.

589
01:18:38,709 --> 01:18:41,200
他要走那邊 他要走那邊
He wants to go that way, he wants to go that way.

590
01:18:41,378 --> 01:18:43,141
有槍的人可以決定
The one with the gun gets to say.

591
01:18:43,314 --> 01:18:46,306
我有槍所以決定去飛機那
And I've got the gun, and I say we go to the plane.

592
01:18:46,749 --> 01:18:48,216
好的
Okay.

593
01:18:51,054 --> 01:18:52,316
上吉普
In the jeep.

594
01:18:54,123 --> 01:18:56,557
我們一到飛機那，吉普就還你
When we get there, you can have your jeep back.

595
01:18:56,726 --> 01:18:58,990
- 還有槍 - 再說吧！
- And my gun. - We'll see about that.

596
01:19:04,433 --> 01:19:07,766
- 你這是干什么？ - 是他的東西
- What do you think you're doing? - It's his, boss.

597
01:19:13,007 --> 01:19:14,406
停！
Stop.

598
01:19:15,276 --> 01:19:17,210
印子又出現了
Here are those tracks again.

599
01:19:17,945 --> 01:19:19,537
飛機一定在那邊
The plane must be that way.

600
01:19:19,714 --> 01:19:22,945
- 我不想再當輪子了 - 我們可以修
- I'm not gonna be the wheel again. - Now we can fix it.

601
01:19:23,517 --> 01:19:26,714
- 我沒看到唧筒 - 不要，看好他們
- I don't see a pump. - Don't! You've got to watch them.

602
01:19:32,893 --> 01:19:34,622
- 是你的人？ - 不是
- One of yours? - No.

603
01:19:34,794 --> 01:19:35,852
監獵員
Game rangers.

604
01:19:36,029 --> 01:19:39,192
- 你打算怎么做？ - 別讓他看見象牙
- What are we gonna do? - Don't let him see the ivory.

605
01:19:39,365 --> 01:19:41,196
或許他們有唧筒
Maybe they've got a pump.

606
01:19:48,374 --> 01:19:49,864
你能借我們唧筒嗎？
Could you lend us a pump?

607
01:19:50,042 --> 01:19:51,202
什么？
What?

608
01:19:52,810 --> 01:19:54,744
我們能借唧筒用在...？
Could we borrow a pump with a...?

609
01:19:54,913 --> 01:19:56,210
噢，不要！
Oh, no!

610
01:19:58,383 --> 01:19:59,873
你們對他怎樣了？
What have you done to him?

611
01:20:05,489 --> 01:20:06,683
丟掉！
Drop that!

612
01:20:07,791 --> 01:20:09,418
丟掉！
Throw it away!

613
01:20:12,829 --> 01:20:14,194

拿槍
Get the gun.

615
01:20:23,005 --> 01:20:25,200
現在怎么辦，老板？
What do we do now, boss?

616
01:20:28,444 --> 01:20:30,275
- 綁起來 - 老板？

01:20:38,286 --> 01:20:40,447
- 怎么回事？ - 我討厭盜獵的
- What's this about? - I don't like game rangers.

620
01:20:40,622 --> 01:20:42,613
- 我不是盜獵的 - 我也不是
- I'm not a game ranger. - Me too.

621
01:20:43,757 --> 01:20:47,454
- 我只是找到這個，老板 - 兩個兩個綁
- This is all I've got, boss. - Tie them two by two.

622
01:21:05,378 --> 01:21:07,209
這下該怎么做？
What are we gonna do now, boss?

623
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:09,245
我得跟藍吉談談
I gotta talk to Ramjee.

624
01:21:16,355 --> 01:21:19,813
大班呼叫藍吉，聽到沒有？
Big Ben calling Ramjee. Do you read me?

625
01:21:19,992 --> 01:21:21,983
藍吉，聽到沒有？
Ramjee, do you read me?

626
01:21:22,394 --> 01:21:24,453
距離太遠了
Out of range again.

627
01:21:24,662 --> 01:21:26,129
喬治，你看到圓頂了嗎？
George, you see that dome?

628
01:21:27,298 --> 01:21:29,357
我上去連絡
I'm gonna go up there to get range.

629
01:21:29,533 --> 01:21:31,865
去告訴藍吉
Got to talk to Ramjee about this.

630
01:21:36,406 --> 01:21:40,308
交給你了，好好看著他們
I'm leaving you in charge. You watch these people.

631
01:21:56,358 --> 01:22:00,385
你們沒事吧？乖一點 不會傷到你們
Okay, now, you people. You behave, nobody gets hurt.

632
01:22:16,676 --> 01:22:17,870
拿槍！
Get the gun!

633
01:22:21,081 --> 01:22:24,380
嘿，你不能這么做 老板會殺了你

634
01:22:24,918 --> 01:22:27,751
- 拿到了 - 好，走吧
- Got it. - Okay, let's go.

635
01:22:29,355 --> 01:22:31,823
- 上車 - 什么意思？

- I'm gonna come too. He's gonna kill me. - You, give me first gear.

640
01:22:55,245 --> 01:22:59,147

Move your ass, man.

642
01:23:09,559 --> 01:23:12,392
今天真精彩，盜獵的 士兵和女人

643
01:23:12,562 --> 01:23:15,463
- 你怎么對他們的？ - 把他們綁起來
<i>- What did you do with them? - I tied them up.</i>

644
01:23:15,631 --> 01:23:16,859
怎么回事？
What the hell?

645
01:23:20,602 --> 01:23:21,899
喬治！
George!

646

- 是！ - 不，不是！
- It is! - No, it's not!

650
01:23:54,901 --> 01:23:56,528
非逮到這混蛋
I'll get the bastard!

651
01:24:27,564 --> 01:24:29,327
起來幫我松綁
No, get up. Untie me.

652

等一下 他沒那么瘋
Wait a minute. He's not so crazy.

656
01:26:09,459 --> 01:26:11,290
他知道自己在做什么
He knows what he's doing.

657
01:26:19,768 --> 01:26:22,259
他放火燒出一條生路
He's making a firebreak. Clever little bugger.

658
01:26:54,333 --> 01:26:56,494
會燒完的
It'll burn out now.

659

燒完了
That's it.

660
01:27:07,445 --> 01:27:08,673
是你的孩子？
They're your kids?

661
01:27:08,846 --> 01:27:12,441
我們剛才碰過面 有一個小的還有另一個
We passed them back there. There's a tiny one and the other one.

662
01:27:13,451 --> 01:27:14,850
對，那邊
That way.

663
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:25,219
- 你怎么哭了？ - 他的孩子不見了
- Why are you crying? - He lost his kids.

664
01:27:25,395 --> 01:27:28,125
我告訴他在哪

665
01:27:28,632 --> 01:27:30,964
你又要走了
So you have to disappear again.

666
01:27:34,136 --> 01:27:35,398
再見...

回來呀！
Out of my way!

671
01:28:41,732 --> 01:28:43,757
- 我要你們再做一次 - 做什么？！
- I want you guys to do that again. - Do what?!

672
01:28:43,934 --> 01:28:45,663
- 剛才做的 - 為什么？
- What you just did. - What the hell for?

673
01:28:45,870 --> 01:28:48,202
是遠距離 他打不中移動的目標的
It's a telescopic sight. He can't hit a moving target.

674
01:28:48,406 --> 01:28:50,101
- 不！ - 當我一下令...
- No! - When I say go...

675
01:28:50,273 --> 01:28:52,241
你就拼命跑，好嗎？
...you run around like crazy. All right?

676
01:28:53,243 --> 01:28:54,938
開始！
Go!

677
01:29:05,888 --> 01:29:07,947
別動啊，混蛋
Stand still, you bastards.

丟掉
Throw it away.

679
01:29:40,454 --> 01:29:43,446
好的，好的... 我是你的囚犯
Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm your goddamn prisoner.

680
01:29:44,990 --> 01:29:48,448
我不要你 沒用的人犯
I don't want you. You're a shitty prisoner.

681
01:30:05,276 --> 01:30:06,504
奇爾！
Xiri!

682
01:30:51,285 --> 01:30:55,688
不要一次拉拉雜雜說一堆 告訴我你在哪里就好了

683
01:31:00,860 --> 01:31:02,088
你說什么？

684
01:32:25,005 --> 01:32:28,771
- 好了，謝謝 - 好的，再見

Bugger off to Cuba and don't get lost.

686
01:32:48,159 --> 01:32:49,592
看到那個山丘了嗎？
See that hill over there?

687
01:32:49,761 --> 01:32:52,286
直走過去，就找到吉普了
You head straight for it, and you'll find your jeep.

688
01:32:57,535 --> 01:32:59,594

01:33:20,456 --> 01:33:25,860
你可能一年 但這個混蛋可久了
Maybe you'll get a year, but this bastard's gonna sit for a long time.

694
01:33:35,804 --> 01:33:36,828
ECACL會議

搜索4百公里范圍

我看不見！
I can't see!

704
01:34:40,130 --> 01:34:42,360
