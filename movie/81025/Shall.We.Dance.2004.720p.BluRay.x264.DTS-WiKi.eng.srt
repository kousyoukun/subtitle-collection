1
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,530
(man) A million and a half people
ride the El trains every day.

2
00:00:35,601 --> 00:00:40,470
Over 20 years, I've written wills
for about 8,000 of 'em.

3
00:00:41,473 --> 00:00:44,601
I've sat with 'em
as they've combed through their assets,

4
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:47,976
figured out which kid
gets the painting over the fireplace,

5
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:51,949
which one gets
the antique spoon collection.

6
00:00:52,017 --> 00:00:58,217
Last thanks, parting shots, confessions...
People try to fit it all in.

7
00:01:00,592 --> 00:01:04,688
And once I've finished,
another life has been summed up -

8
00:01:04,763 --> 00:01:08,426
assets and debts tallied,
then zeroed out.

9
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,867
You initial here and there,
you sign at the bottom.

10
00:01:11,937 --> 00:01:15,771
Then, if you're like most clients,
you look up, smile,

11
00:01:15,841 --> 00:01:21,279
and you ask the question
I've heard for 20 years: "Is that it, then?"

12
00:01:22,147 --> 00:01:27,949
"That's it for the paperwork, " I tell 'em.
"The rest is up to you. "

13
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:34,990
(mixed singing) ¡ì Happy birthday to you,
Happy birthday to you

14
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:41,090
¡ì Happy birthday, dear Dad
Happy birthday to you

15
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:43,999
Ohh, wow, Beautiful,

16
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:45,661
All right, makeawish.

17
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:48,206
(mobile-phone jingle)

18
00:01:49,475 --> 00:01:51,375
Sorry, I just have to take this call,

19
00:01:51,443 --> 00:01:54,207
- Did you win?
- "Take this call"?

20
00:01:54,279 --> 00:01:58,545
- She's 1 4, How can she be "taking calls"?
- Jen, not now, Now's not the time,

21
00:01:58,617 --> 00:02:01,415
Remind me, why was it we agreed
to give her the phone?

22
00:02:01,487 --> 00:02:03,546
- Emergencies,
- Which this is, by the way,

23
00:02:03,622 --> 00:02:05,556
Serious problem over there,

24
00:02:05,624 --> 00:02:07,524
Get off, Jen, Now, please, Come on,

25
00:02:07,593 --> 00:02:09,356
- All right!
- Come on, get off,

26
00:02:09,428 --> 00:02:14,297
Yeah, my dad's just gonna blow out
about a million candles, Bye,

27
00:02:14,366 --> 00:02:17,858
All right, everyone,
are we all happy now?

28
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:23,506
Thank you, Thank you,

29
00:02:23,575 --> 00:02:27,011
Thank you, Thank you very much,
Thank you, Thank you,

30
00:02:30,315 --> 00:02:33,011
- Sorry about the bathrobe,
- What do you mean?

31
00:02:33,085 --> 00:02:36,054
Oh, I just had such a hard time
getting you a present,

32
00:02:36,121 --> 00:02:37,315
I love this bathrobe,

33
00:02:37,389 --> 00:02:40,586
I think the problem is
that you never really want anything,

34
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:42,126
- That's not true,
- That's true,

35
00:02:42,194 --> 00:02:44,924
- Tell me one thing that you really want,
- What you gave me tonight,

36
00:02:44,997 --> 00:02:47,966
Evan coming home, everyone's at dinner,
that cake you make,,,

37
00:02:48,033 --> 00:02:52,299
Tell me one thing that you want
that comes in a box,

38
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:56,403
I rest my case,

39
00:03:07,686 --> 00:03:11,918
Yes! That's it! That's it!
That's what we needed,

40
00:03:16,795 --> 00:03:19,662
Good night, Mary,
I left the Anderson will on your desk,

41
00:03:19,731 --> 00:03:21,722
Night, Bill,

42
00:03:50,395 --> 00:03:53,057
(PA) Next stop, Sedgwick.

43
00:03:53,832 --> 00:03:56,960
- Hello, I'm home,
- (female laughter)

44
00:03:58,704 --> 00:04:01,002
(shrieking / burst of music)

45
00:04:03,809 --> 00:04:05,970
There's a female bonding ritual
going on in the den,

46
00:04:06,044 --> 00:04:07,705
- I know,
- What are they doing in there?

47
00:04:07,779 --> 00:04:11,146
Tattooing "l love Satan" on their foreheads,
piercing their bellybuttons, stuff like that,

48
00:04:11,216 --> 00:04:14,947
- Great, What did you say about that?
- I said, "Don't get any blood on the couch,"

49
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:18,046
I worry about Jenna, She's too beautiful,
That's your fault,

50
00:04:18,123 --> 00:04:19,647
- Here, sign this,
- What is it?

51
00:04:19,725 --> 00:04:21,920
- It's your mom's birthday card,
- Oh, God, thank you,

52
00:04:21,994 --> 00:04:24,724
- How was your workout?
- Same, How are you?

53
00:04:24,796 --> 00:04:28,357
Fine, You know, ordering the spring line
at the store, yada-yada,

54
00:04:28,433 --> 00:04:31,869
- I've got to get going,
- I thought you just got here,

55
00:04:31,937 --> 00:04:34,371
Yeah, but it's the fundraiser
at Jen's school,

56
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:37,237
So your dinner's in the oven
and the girls have already eaten,

57
00:04:37,309 --> 00:04:40,904
Can we go see a movie sometime?

58
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:45,848
Yeah, Or at least we could
look at the ads in the paper together,

59
00:04:48,987 --> 00:04:51,182
How are you doing?

60
00:04:51,256 --> 00:04:53,247
Fine,

61
00:04:56,361 --> 00:04:58,625
Check on them now and then, OK?

62
00:04:58,697 --> 00:05:00,858
Don't wait up,

63
00:05:07,072 --> 00:05:09,802
- Get out of here, Dad!
- (shrieking)

64
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:07,594
(dance music)

65
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,538
(hits key hard and music stops)

66
00:06:25,183 --> 00:06:29,279
Bev? It's not true
that I don't want anything,

67
00:06:34,926 --> 00:06:36,894
Bev?

68
00:07:07,092 --> 00:07:09,788
(PA) Doors open on the right.

69
00:07:18,503 --> 00:07:21,199
- Doors closing. Next stop, Sedgwick.
- Excuse me,

70
00:07:32,317 --> 00:07:36,014
(to himself) Oh, my God, What
are you doing? What are you doing?

71
00:07:40,859 --> 00:07:43,225
You know what? I'm gonna just go up,

72
00:07:47,532 --> 00:07:49,227
Oh, my God,

73
00:07:53,138 --> 00:07:55,299
(laughter and chatter)

74
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:57,842
(woman) That was a great class,

75
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,271
Come on,

76
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:07,045
- Are we goin' up, or what?
- I'm just trying to,,,

77
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:09,053
Here,

78
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:11,689
- OK, don't do that,
- Do what?

79
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:15,158
Stand there looking dumb,
It's just not cute in a guy your age,

80
00:08:15,227 --> 00:08:17,388
Be a doll and help me carry my clothes,

81
00:08:17,462 --> 00:08:20,727
Come on, And stop lookin' at my ass,

82
00:08:21,099 --> 00:08:23,192
I'll try,

83
00:08:24,069 --> 00:08:27,232
T,,, A,,, N-G-O,,,

84
00:08:27,672 --> 00:08:31,039
T,,, A,,, N-G-O,,,

85
00:08:31,376 --> 00:08:35,142
T,,, A,,, N-G,,, Oh!

86
00:08:35,213 --> 00:08:38,649
- I found him at the bottom of the stairs,
- Um,,, Uh,,,

87
00:08:38,717 --> 00:08:41,413
Paulina, could you help?

88
00:08:41,486 --> 00:08:43,750
Excuse me,

89
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:52,187
May I help you?

90
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:55,559
The sign said "Feel free to watch,"

91
00:08:55,634 --> 00:08:58,000
Are you here for lessons?

92
00:08:58,904 --> 00:09:00,303
Yes,

93
00:09:01,573 --> 00:09:04,007
- Mr,,,?
- Clark,

94
00:09:04,743 --> 00:09:07,473
Are you registering
as a couple or as a single?

95
00:09:07,546 --> 00:09:10,106
Single, I mean, not that I'm,,,

96
00:09:12,984 --> 00:09:15,214
Single, Yeah, just me,

97
00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:22,383
Single privates are $45 an hour, If you buy
six at a time, the price per class drops $5,

98
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:26,295
- Have you ever danced before?
- No, No, But I'm a fast learner,

99
00:09:26,364 --> 00:09:28,491
We're starting a new intro ballroom series
for singles,

100
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:31,593
I recommend that beginners start with that,
There's still room in the class,

101
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:35,436
It meets every Wednesday at 7:30,
for eight weeks,

102
00:09:35,507 --> 00:09:37,532
All right.

00:09:38,677 --> 00:09:41,612
Right, Wednesdays, 7:30, Great,

104
00:09:42,147 --> 00:09:44,172

106
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:53,050
Where are you going?

107
00:09:53,124 --> 00:09:54,751

108

Oh, right, yeah, Wednesday, 7:30,

112
00:10:23,622 --> 00:10:25,715
Hey, I'm Vern,

So, you dance much?

117
00:10:48,713 --> 00:10:52,479
High-school prom, "Stairway to Heaven,"

118
00:10:53,718 --> 00:10:57,313
- You?
- Not even a prom, I didn't go,

119
00:10:57,389 --> 00:11:03,419
Anybody see any girls?
I mean, I'm here for the babes, right,

120
00:11:03,495 --> 00:11:05,895
I mean, it can't be just us, can it?

121
00:11:06,898 --> 00:11:12,359
Guys dancin' with guys ain't my kinda

123
00:11:21,112 --> 00:11:22,773
Hi,

See the slinky one with the eyebrows?
That's me - if you don't mind,

125
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:30,183
I know you won't mind,

126
00:11:31,623 --> 00:11:34,091
- Be my guest,

Ouch,

131

Memories of high school, huh, boys?

132
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:54,308
(she laughs)

133
00:12:11,963 --> 00:12:16,593
Good evening, gentlemen, and

134
00:12:16,668 --> 00:12:20,297
My name is Miss Mitzi, I am the owner

Disappointed that I'm older?

136

00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:45,687
Wait a minute, Vern,
Where is your right foot?

144
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:49,029
- It's right back there, See?
- Yes, I know, It hasn't moved, has it?

145
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,328
Not yet,

146
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:52,427

155
00:13:20,365 --> 00:13:22,333
Let me see what you're doing, Ah!

156
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,028
- Miss Mitzi, I'm sorry, Sorry,
- God! Jesus!

157
00:13:25,103 --> 00:13:27,037
- I said I'm sorry,
- Put the stick down,

158
00:13:27,105 --> 00:13:30,336
We're not gonna play with these sticks
anymore if you boys won't behave,

159
00:13:30,408 --> 00:13:33,605
A little faster this time. And...

160
00:13:33,678 --> 00:13:37,546
Heel, toe, toe-toe, toe, heel, toe-toe,

161
00:13:37,615 --> 00:13:40,413
Excuse me, When we go forward,
is it heel-toe or toe,,,

162
00:13:40,485 --> 00:13:42,715
It's forward, heel, toe, toe-,,,

163
00:13:42,787 --> 00:13:45,415
So it's back,,, Whoa,,,

164
00:13:54,432 --> 00:13:57,731
Harder than it looks, isn't it, gentlemen?

165
00:13:57,802 --> 00:14:00,862
Well, you've all done very very well
for your first lesson,

166
00:14:00,939 --> 00:14:02,497
And before you leave tonight,

167
00:14:02,574 --> 00:14:06,635
I'm gonna give you a little incentive
to keep on dancing,

168
00:14:06,711 --> 00:14:08,076
Paulina?

169
00:14:08,146 --> 00:14:12,446
Would you and Francesco mind giving
our new students a little demonstration?

170
00:14:12,517 --> 00:14:14,644
Certainly, Miss Mitzi,

171
00:14:14,719 --> 00:14:16,880
Daphne?

172
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:22,726
(¡ì "Moon River" - instrumental)

173
00:15:26,157 --> 00:15:27,954
Thank you, Paulina,

174
00:15:31,129 --> 00:15:33,689
Whoo! Whoo!

175
00:15:34,766 --> 00:15:37,200
That was beautiful,

176
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:41,568
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm good,

177
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,072
Hey, guys, wait up, I'm comin',

178
00:15:45,143 --> 00:15:47,634
(Chic) Great, How lucky for us,

179
00:15:47,712 --> 00:15:48,906
- Hey,
- Where are we goin'?

180
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,948
- Somewhere close,
- Yeah, I haven't got long,

181
00:15:51,015 --> 00:15:52,505
Anyway, you guys, don't go to Jim's.

182
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:54,984
They got a bad roach problem
there around the corner,

183
00:15:55,053 --> 00:15:58,489
You're gonna go anywhere after class,
you come here, OK? Thank you,

184
00:15:58,556 --> 00:16:00,217
Why'd you guys decide to take dance,
anyway?

185
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,851
- I'm gettin' married in September,
- Nice,

186
00:16:02,927 --> 00:16:05,589
Yeah, My bride said
she'd like to see me lose a few pounds,

187
00:16:05,663 --> 00:16:09,064
She thinks the dancing will help,
I said it won't,

188
00:16:09,133 --> 00:16:12,534
- I think you'll win that argument,
- I'm taking classes to impress the ladies,

189
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:14,401
You know what they say
about guys who can dance, right?

190
00:16:14,472 --> 00:16:16,440
- That they're great in bed,
- Yeah, baby,

191
00:16:16,507 --> 00:16:19,965
- Where do you get that stupid crap?
- Everywhere, What do you think?

192
00:16:20,044 --> 00:16:23,571
Everybody knows a guy who can move
on the dance floor can move in the sack,

193
00:16:23,648 --> 00:16:27,311
Most guys, they can't dance at all, Guys
who can, they get their pick of the litter,

194
00:16:27,385 --> 00:16:29,910
That's why, when I'm done with this class,
babes will drop at my feet,

195
00:16:29,988 --> 00:16:32,047
They're gonna be droppin' dead
at your feet,

196
00:16:32,123 --> 00:16:36,389
When you took your shoes off in class
today, I had to run to the window for air,

197
00:16:36,461 --> 00:16:39,396
What kind of person says something like
that to somebody they don't even know?

198
00:16:39,464 --> 00:16:41,193
Hey, man, I'm doin' you a favor,

199
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:44,064
I'm telling you something obnoxious about
yourself that you might not be aware of,

200
00:16:44,135 --> 00:16:46,569
If there's something obnoxious about me
that you don't think I'm aware of,

201
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:50,540
y'all should feel free
to say something about it to me,

202
00:16:51,476 --> 00:16:53,467
Shooting fish in a barrel,

203
00:16:53,544 --> 00:16:56,479
- Where are all the ladies, anyways?
- I don't know what I'm talking about,

204
00:16:56,547 --> 00:16:59,277
The ladies, they all go and take the classes
down at Doctor Dance -

205
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:03,548
that's, like, the hip place to go downtown,
Ditzy Mitzi's is only hangin' on by a thread,

206
00:17:03,621 --> 00:17:07,318
Only reason I go there is she lets me
rehearse whenever I want for free,

207
00:17:07,392 --> 00:17:10,657
I'm gonna compete
in the Chicago Taittinger Trophy,

208
00:17:10,728 --> 00:17:13,128
Soon as I find a partner,

209
00:17:13,197 --> 00:17:17,133
So,,, that leaves you,

210
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:19,998
Leaves me? How? What?

211
00:17:20,071 --> 00:17:23,336
Leaves you as the only one here
who hasn't said why he's dancing yet,

212
00:17:23,408 --> 00:17:26,400
Oh, Well, I'm dancing for exercise,
like Vern,

213
00:17:26,477 --> 00:17:27,569
Bull,

214
00:17:27,645 --> 00:17:30,478
Because I'm lousy in bed, like Chic,
There, I've said it,

215
00:17:30,548 --> 00:17:34,348
- That is bull! I didn't say I was bad in bed,
- You didn't have to,

216
00:17:34,419 --> 00:17:36,410
Come on, why?

217
00:17:37,221 --> 00:17:39,951
Is there any pepper here?
Could I have some?

218
00:17:40,024 --> 00:17:42,424
That's what I thought,

219
00:17:42,493 --> 00:17:45,018
She was a Blackpool finalist, you know,

220
00:17:45,096 --> 00:17:46,085
Who?

221
00:17:46,164 --> 00:17:49,031
The princess, The other teacher, Paulina,

222
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,227
What's Blackpool?

223
00:17:51,302 --> 00:17:53,566
Every year, all the best dancers
from all over the world

224
00:17:53,638 --> 00:17:57,597
go to England to compete there,
She was there last year with her partner -

225
00:17:57,675 --> 00:18:00,508
who they say was much more to her
than just her partner,

226
00:18:00,578 --> 00:18:03,274
Anyway, he dumped her, That's the only
reason she came back here to teach -

227
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:05,441
mad at the world,
boo-hoo-hoo and all that,

228
00:18:05,516 --> 00:18:06,949
- Why'd he dump her?
- Yeah,

229
00:18:07,018 --> 00:18:11,717
How the hell should I know?
God, they say women gossip! Golly!

230
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:38,011
Hello? I'm home,

231
00:18:56,401 --> 00:19:00,770
Great, Great, Vern,
Slow, The mambo is slow,

232
00:19:00,838 --> 00:19:02,567
Slide that hand
one inch south of the equator

233
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,200
and I will bust you on your ass,
twinkle-toes,

234
00:19:05,276 --> 00:19:10,270
Let's get something straight, I don't like
the tropics any more than you do, OK?

235
00:19:25,897 --> 00:19:27,956
(Miss Mitzi) Five, six, seven, eight...

236
00:19:28,032 --> 00:19:31,297
Arms. And basic.
And crossover.

237
00:19:32,236 --> 00:19:33,567
Right,

238
00:19:33,638 --> 00:19:36,198
One more time, and walk around,

239
00:19:37,141 --> 00:19:40,110
- And basic,
- Watch out,

240
00:19:40,178 --> 00:19:42,339
And big ending.

241
00:19:51,122 --> 00:19:53,488
Look at you, John!

242
00:20:01,399 --> 00:20:05,802
- That was pretty good,
- (Miss Mitzi) You were really good,

243
00:20:06,704 --> 00:20:09,229
(voices fade)

244
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:36,657
Hey, I'm sorry I'm late,
I'm gonna go up and change,

245
00:20:36,734 --> 00:20:38,759
Right,

246
00:20:38,836 --> 00:20:42,567
- Dad work late tonight?
- Yeah, looks that way,

247
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:47,504
Guess whatever he's working on,
he must like it,

248
00:20:47,578 --> 00:20:51,571
- Why do you say that?
- He seems happier lately,

249
00:20:55,086 --> 00:20:57,179
Does he?

250
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:04,287
I called the Halston people in New York,

251
00:21:04,362 --> 00:21:07,923
We're gonna have trouble getting more
stock in, Everything's on back-order,

252
00:21:07,999 --> 00:21:11,457
Look, Carolyn, I'm gonna need you
to go to New York and sweet-talk them,

253
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:14,027
- Can you leave tomorrow?
- No,

254
00:21:14,105 --> 00:21:16,164
Why not?

255
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,175
My husband is having an affair,

256
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,514
How do you know that?

257
00:21:24,582 --> 00:21:27,346
I picked up the receiver last night
to phone a friend,

258
00:21:27,418 --> 00:21:32,583
not knowing that Greg was already
on the other line in the den,

259
00:21:32,657 --> 00:21:34,682
He was whispering,

260
00:21:35,426 --> 00:21:37,451
What was he whispering?

261
00:21:37,528 --> 00:21:39,621
I don't know,

262
00:21:39,697 --> 00:21:43,258
I was so scared I hung up
before I could hear anything,

263
00:21:43,334 --> 00:21:47,270
Well, there's lots of other reasons
why he could be whispering,

264
00:21:47,338 --> 00:21:51,775
I mean, maybe he didn't wanna
wake up the kids, Huh?

265
00:21:51,842 --> 00:21:57,439
Or he could be planning a surprise for you,
I mean, your birthday's coming up, isn't it?

266
00:21:59,517 --> 00:22:02,247
In two weeks,

267
00:22:03,754 --> 00:22:05,813
(gasps with relief)

268
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:09,384
That's it,

269
00:22:12,196 --> 00:22:16,496
Take a breath, go get yourself a brownie
in the kitchen, just chill, It's gonna be fine,

270
00:22:16,567 --> 00:22:18,558
OK,

271
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:22,064
- Euh!
- Ooh-hoo-hoo!

272
00:22:22,139 --> 00:22:24,505
You silly goose, you,

273
00:22:26,577 --> 00:22:29,171
She'll be divorced by Easter,

274
00:22:31,482 --> 00:22:34,315
(¡ì jazz and Latin fusion)

275
00:22:40,191 --> 00:22:43,251
Come on, John, Join the warm-up,

276
00:23:22,433 --> 00:23:23,422
Ow!

277
00:23:23,501 --> 00:23:26,493
- Jesus! I'm sorry!
- Watch your floorcraft, spasmo!

278
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:30,062
What, you think you own this floor? I'll
have a bruise the size of Texas tomorrow!

279
00:23:30,141 --> 00:23:32,609
- Go away!
- Go away? You go away!

280
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:35,578
Take your stupid music with you!
I can't dance to that crap,

281
00:23:35,646 --> 00:23:38,843
You just gonna stand there
and let that fat cow insult you?

282
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:43,876
- I'm sorry, what did you say?
- Nothing, She didn't say anything,

283
00:23:43,954 --> 00:23:45,785
(screams)

284
00:23:54,498 --> 00:23:57,467
Sorry, These are the teeth
I wear for the Latin,

285
00:23:57,535 --> 00:24:00,470
It gets your smile out there,
Just a little bit bigger smile,

286
00:24:00,538 --> 00:24:03,371
Bam! Gets the judges right in the eye,
catches the light,

287
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:05,102
And then the make-up -
you know the make-up,

288
00:24:05,176 --> 00:24:08,202
"Swish-butt," "Fancy pants," "Pinky boy",,,

289
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:11,510
All these names, all these names I've been
called ever since I was eight years old

290
00:24:11,582 --> 00:24:14,676
and dancing around
to my mother's rumba records,

291
00:24:14,752 --> 00:24:17,516
You know what the worst of it is? Huh?

292
00:24:18,622 --> 00:24:22,888
I'm not gay, Can you imagine how much
easier my life would be if I were?

293
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,087
I mean, a straight man
who likes to dance around in sequins

294
00:24:25,162 --> 00:24:27,858
walks a very lonely road,
I got news for you,

295
00:24:27,932 --> 00:24:29,866
Look, you're not gonna
tell anybody in the office, are you?

296
00:24:29,934 --> 00:24:33,426
No, no, no, I wouldn't do that,
Look, I'm in the same boat, aren't l?

297
00:24:33,504 --> 00:24:35,096
No, you're not, You're not,

298
00:24:35,172 --> 00:24:37,732
- Why not?
- Because,,, people like you,

299
00:24:37,808 --> 00:24:39,503
You know what I mean? You're charming,

300
00:24:39,577 --> 00:24:43,673
I'm Linky Link, They would crucify me
if they found out,

301
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:47,184
I'm the sports trivia king,
I'm the super sports fan, you know?

302
00:24:47,251 --> 00:24:50,414
- You don't like football?
- l,,, You know,

303
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:53,548
Run three yards, fall down, pile up,
Run three yards, fall down, pile up,

304
00:24:53,624 --> 00:24:57,060
I mean, you know, four months of that,
I'm ready to put a gun to my head,

305
00:24:57,128 --> 00:25:00,325
- Fooled me,
- I know, I fooled everybody,

306
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:02,229
You know what my dream is?

307
00:25:02,299 --> 00:25:04,130
What?

308
00:25:05,169 --> 00:25:10,835
My dream,,, is to be able to dance
free and proud,

309
00:25:10,908 --> 00:25:14,002
Under my own name,
For all the world to see,

310
00:25:14,078 --> 00:25:16,308
That's my dream,

311
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,143
Did I get it all?

312
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:25,417
Hey, Andy, It's Bev,

313
00:25:25,489 --> 00:25:28,822
Look, I'm sorry to call you so late,
I was just trying to find John,

314
00:25:28,893 --> 00:25:34,525
Called the office at six and Betsy said
that he'd left for the day, and I was just,,,

315
00:25:34,598 --> 00:25:37,658
You got home by five?
How did you manage that, you lucky dog?

316
00:25:37,735 --> 00:25:41,296
Ah, there's the door,
OK, See you, Bye,

317
00:25:41,372 --> 00:25:43,101
Sorry I'm late, I got hung up at the office,

318
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:45,972
I wish you'd call, 'cause we were looking
all over for your car keys forever,,,

319
00:25:46,043 --> 00:25:48,944
- I thought you were shopping with Jenna,
- That was weeks ago,

320
00:25:49,013 --> 00:25:51,880
I called the office
and Betsy said you left for the day at six,

321
00:25:51,949 --> 00:25:53,883
Yeah, I did - for a sandwich,
Then I came back,

322
00:25:53,951 --> 00:25:56,977
Oh, Well, I called your private line
a few times, nobody picked up,

323
00:25:57,054 --> 00:25:59,318
That's because I wasn't working
in my office, I was in Andy's,

324
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:01,017
Oh, How is Andy?

325
00:26:01,091 --> 00:26:05,323
We're working
on a really big estate plan together,

326
00:26:05,396 --> 00:26:07,796
- So he was there?
- What?

327
00:26:07,865 --> 00:26:09,526
Was Andy there?

328
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,329
Why are you asking me
all these questions?

329
00:26:11,402 --> 00:26:13,336
I don't know,

330
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:18,670
Anyway, I stopped off for a bite
on the way home with Link Peterson,

331
00:26:18,742 --> 00:26:21,336
Remember him? Interesting guy,

332
00:26:22,012 --> 00:26:24,742
Not what you'd think,

333
00:26:24,815 --> 00:26:27,215
- How was your day?
- Great,

334
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:38,386
(John, quietly) One, two, three, four,,,

335
00:26:39,697 --> 00:26:42,063
One, two, three,,,

336
00:26:58,849 --> 00:27:00,316
Mom?

337
00:27:00,985 --> 00:27:03,317
Dad's acting weird,

338
00:27:11,095 --> 00:27:16,294
They met five years ago
in a chat room for gardeners,

339
00:27:18,702 --> 00:27:20,966
He says they're in love,

340
00:27:21,739 --> 00:27:24,037
He's moving out Saturday,

341
00:27:24,108 --> 00:27:27,134
He'll be back, He loves those kids,

342
00:27:27,211 --> 00:27:29,270
I thought we were happy,

343
00:27:29,346 --> 00:27:31,610
He seemed happy to me,

344
00:27:32,816 --> 00:27:35,341
I didn't know anything,

345
00:27:37,154 --> 00:27:38,781
I didn't know,

346
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:43,584
(pants)

347
00:27:47,598 --> 00:27:49,657
- Oh,,,
- (toilet flushes)

348
00:27:49,733 --> 00:27:51,792
Hi,

349
00:27:51,869 --> 00:27:56,897
I, uh,,, I give free consultations
during my lunch hour,

350
00:27:56,974 --> 00:27:59,374
You sure you don't wanna come in?

351
00:28:00,244 --> 00:28:02,075
So he comes home late on Wednesdays,

352
00:28:02,146 --> 00:28:04,114
and when he comes home
his shirts smell like perfume,

353
00:28:04,181 --> 00:28:07,446
He's been seen making strange body
movements and you feel he has a secret,

354
00:28:07,518 --> 00:28:10,112
- That's correct,
- Ever think about just asking him?

355
00:28:10,187 --> 00:28:13,748
- Yes, I've thought about it,,,
- Mrs, Clark,,,

356
00:28:13,824 --> 00:28:18,158
things happen in long marriages,
To the best of people,

357
00:28:18,228 --> 00:28:21,129
And sometimes the thing that happens
doesn't mean anything,

358
00:28:21,198 --> 00:28:24,099
Doesn't need an investigator, just needs
somebody to look the other way for a while,

359
00:28:24,168 --> 00:28:28,730
My husband is a serious man, Mr, Devine,
If he's having an affair, it is not casual,

360
00:28:28,806 --> 00:28:31,502
In which case,
the sooner I know, the better,

361
00:28:33,177 --> 00:28:37,011
All right, Give me a moment
while I call in my associate, Mr, Harcourt,

362
00:28:37,081 --> 00:28:39,072
Scottie!

363
00:28:40,451 --> 00:28:42,214
Scottie Harcourt, this is Mrs, Clark,

364
00:28:42,286 --> 00:28:44,686
She suspects
her husband's up to no good,

365
00:28:44,755 --> 00:28:49,089
"To catch a husband is an art,
To hold him is a job,"

366
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:52,651
Simone de Beauvoir said that,
It's very nice to meet you, Mrs, Clark,

367
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:53,719
Same here,

368
00:28:53,797 --> 00:28:56,789
I think we can start this investigation
without too much cost to Mrs, Clark,

369
00:28:56,867 --> 00:29:01,998
Yes, Follow that husband around for a few
days, take some pictures, see what's up,

370
00:29:02,072 --> 00:29:03,835
But I have to warn you,
if it goes to trial it's gonna be,,,

371
00:29:03,907 --> 00:29:06,137
Trial?

372
00:29:07,444 --> 00:29:09,912
In the event of a divorce,

373
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,777
But we don't know if he's having an affair,

374
00:29:11,849 --> 00:29:17,082
I mean, he could just be involved with,,,
I don't know,,,

375
00:29:18,055 --> 00:29:21,024
people who get together to invest things,

376
00:29:21,091 --> 00:29:26,927
and,,, and the place that they invest things
is,,, filled with potpourri,

377
00:29:26,997 --> 00:29:32,128
and that's why his shirts smell so sweet
when he comes home, It's possible,

378
00:29:32,202 --> 00:29:34,500
Yeah, it's possible, It's possible,

379
00:29:34,571 --> 00:29:39,235
It's possible we could find your husband
neck-deep in potpourri, investing things,

380
00:29:39,309 --> 00:29:41,300
Not likely,

381
00:29:45,382 --> 00:29:47,976
Look, this is what we'll do,

382
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,584
We start out gently,

383
00:29:57,061 --> 00:29:59,086
We look for the potpourri,

384
00:29:59,163 --> 00:30:04,658
And if we find it, and it smells like flowers,
then 2,000 ought to cover my time,

385
00:30:04,735 --> 00:30:09,035
But if we find the potpourri and there's
something big and stinky in the pot,

386
00:30:09,106 --> 00:30:12,598
then you and I renegotiate, OK?
That sound good?

387
00:30:12,676 --> 00:30:14,667
OK,

388
00:30:20,484 --> 00:30:22,349
- Hey,
- Hi,

389
00:30:22,419 --> 00:30:24,683
- How you doin'?
- Good,

390
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:29,757
- I can tell, you know,
- Tell what?

391
00:30:29,827 --> 00:30:32,625
That you've been dancing,
Your posture, it's a dead giveaway,

392
00:30:32,696 --> 00:30:34,857
- You're kidding,
- No,

393
00:30:36,867 --> 00:30:39,495
- How much you been practicing, anyway?
- Just in class,

394
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:43,506
No, Should be five to one,
Five-to-one ratio,

395
00:30:43,574 --> 00:30:47,442
Five hours of practice
for every one hour of class,

396
00:30:49,913 --> 00:30:53,144
Doctor Dance has an open dance party
every Thursday,

397
00:30:53,217 --> 00:30:56,618
Anybody can go and practice,
Even you,

398
00:30:58,222 --> 00:31:00,417
Ballroom is all or nothing, John,

399
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:03,221
I'm draggin' your ass out of class
and onto a real dance floor,

400
00:31:03,293 --> 00:31:06,228
We'll go straight there after work,

401
00:31:06,296 --> 00:31:08,594
- Link?
- Yeah?

402
00:31:08,665 --> 00:31:11,099
Can you really tell?

403
00:31:11,168 --> 00:31:12,863
Yeah,

404
00:31:20,878 --> 00:31:23,972
(¡ì loud up-tempo Latin beat)

405
00:31:34,892 --> 00:31:37,087
Having fun?

406
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:40,653
- What are you doing here?
- Spying,

407
00:32:02,853 --> 00:32:04,844
(piece ends)

408
00:32:07,858 --> 00:32:10,156
Excuse me, we were dancing together,

409
00:32:10,227 --> 00:32:12,991
Dude, she does not wanna dance with you,
Now back off,

410
00:32:13,063 --> 00:32:14,963
Hey, you know, l,,,

411
00:32:15,999 --> 00:32:18,467
(slower music)

412
00:32:19,736 --> 00:32:23,502
Link always insists
on dancing with the youngest girls,

413
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:28,876
I've never seen him with his perfect
partner, Not that those are easy to find,

414
00:32:28,946 --> 00:32:30,914
Have you ever found one?

415
00:32:30,981 --> 00:32:35,884
Once, He was my dancing partner
for 1 5 years,

416
00:32:35,953 --> 00:32:38,820
- We were husband and wife for 1 4,
- Wow,

417
00:32:38,889 --> 00:32:43,588
Yeah, He was my perfect partner,
Doesn't happen twice in a lifetime,

418
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:46,595
I'm lucky it even happened once,

419
00:32:46,663 --> 00:32:47,561
Ah!

420
00:32:47,631 --> 00:32:52,295
At last, a song I know,
Oh, I love this song,

421
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:55,197
¡ì Da da-da da,,,

422
00:32:55,272 --> 00:32:59,868
¡ì Shall we still be together
With our arms around each other

423
00:32:59,943 --> 00:33:04,175
¡ì And shall you be my new romance?

424
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:08,844
¡ì On the clear understanding
that this kind of thing can happen

425
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:13,151
¡ì Shall we dance, shall we dance,
shall we dance?

426
00:33:13,991 --> 00:33:17,757
It's The King and I. Yul Brynner
and Deborah Kerr, Do you remember that?

427
00:33:17,828 --> 00:33:21,093
They held hands like this,,,
Oh, come on, John, let's try it,

428
00:33:21,164 --> 00:33:23,826
- No, No, no, no, I can't, No way, I can't,
- Why not?

429
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:28,929
- Oh, John, come on, Come on,
- I don't,,, No, I don't want to,,,

430
00:33:29,006 --> 00:33:31,372
(Mitzi vocalizes)

431
00:33:35,812 --> 00:33:38,144
Let go, John,

432
00:33:44,955 --> 00:33:46,946
That's it, John,

433
00:33:51,028 --> 00:33:52,052
Whoa!

434
00:33:52,129 --> 00:33:54,825
- Sorry! I wasn't watching,
- Hi! How are you?

435
00:33:54,898 --> 00:33:58,857
- It doesn't matter, We're finished anyway,
- What do you mean?

436
00:33:58,936 --> 00:34:00,961
No offense,
but I can't be your dance partner,

437
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:02,801
- Why?
- You're too much of a freak,

438
00:34:02,873 --> 00:34:06,639
I mean, look at your palms, They're
bright orange from self-tanning lotion,

439
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:12,307
Don't you know you're supposed to wash
your hands after you use that stuff?

440
00:34:17,587 --> 00:34:19,680
Excuse me,

441
00:34:45,148 --> 00:34:48,413
Miss Mitzi couldn't make it tonight,
so I'll be your teacher,

442
00:34:48,485 --> 00:34:50,112
I'm Paulina,

443
00:34:50,187 --> 00:34:55,215
And you're,,, Chic and Vern and,,,

444
00:34:57,427 --> 00:35:00,521
- Tom,
- John, It's John,

445
00:35:02,699 --> 00:35:05,065
What would you like to work on tonight?

446
00:35:05,135 --> 00:35:10,835
Well, in my opinion - Chic - I think since
we're beginners, a good idea would be,,,

447
00:35:10,907 --> 00:35:12,704
Waltz,

448
00:35:12,776 --> 00:35:14,971
Maybe the waltz,

449
00:35:18,081 --> 00:35:20,549
OK, Um,,,

450
00:35:20,617 --> 00:35:24,986
I'll work with you one at a time
and you can be first,

451
00:35:25,989 --> 00:35:28,150
OK, All right,

452
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,034
- Oops,
- I'm sorry,

453
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:08,322
So are you really
a reporter for The Times,

454
00:37:08,391 --> 00:37:10,916
or are you just pickin' up on her,
like everybody else?

455
00:37:10,994 --> 00:37:13,986
I'm a reporter,
Plus, she's not my type,

456
00:37:14,064 --> 00:37:17,727
I like a woman built for comfort,
not for speed,

457
00:37:19,035 --> 00:37:23,836
Really? Why don't you put the camera
down and take me out on the dance floor?

458
00:37:23,907 --> 00:37:28,037
Two reasons: I'm working
and this is not my type of dance,

459
00:37:28,111 --> 00:37:29,772
Well, how do you know
if you've never tried?

460
00:37:29,846 --> 00:37:33,111
Come on, put the camera down,
Come on, give me a shot,

461
00:37:33,183 --> 00:37:34,582
Oh, dear!

462
00:37:34,651 --> 00:37:36,710
Sorry, sorry!

463
00:37:39,322 --> 00:37:41,688
- I'm sorry,
- It's gonna stain,

464
00:37:41,758 --> 00:37:45,285
Don't,,, worry, I'll take care of it,

465
00:38:06,349 --> 00:38:08,943
- Would you like to use this?
- Excuse me?

466
00:38:09,019 --> 00:38:11,647
Just to wipe your coat, or,,,

467
00:38:13,156 --> 00:38:17,320
Go ahead, just take it,
Please, Go ahead,

468
00:38:17,394 --> 00:38:21,125
- It's silly, but it's my favorite coat,
- I'm sorry,

469
00:38:21,198 --> 00:38:23,189
It's vintage,

470
00:38:24,201 --> 00:38:27,728
But this part's real suede,
so now it's ruined,

471
00:38:27,804 --> 00:38:30,364
You sure? Maybe they can fix that,

472
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:33,876
No, I know about stains, It's,,,

473
00:38:34,878 --> 00:38:37,005
You know, I never understood that,
I never understood -

474
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:41,380
Iive cows get dirty all the time,
they don't get stained,

475
00:38:41,451 --> 00:38:45,444
All that leather stands in the mud,
nothing happens, Go figure, What is that?

476
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:48,749
Exactly,

477
00:38:50,927 --> 00:38:54,556
Get a little sauce on your coat and look,

478
00:38:54,631 --> 00:38:56,792
- Why is that?
- I don't know,

479
00:38:56,866 --> 00:39:00,802
We'll have to ask the next cow
that comes by,

480
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:16,546
A man with a handkerchief, Wow,
I didn't know they made those anymore,

481
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:28,491
I haven't eaten yet, If you haven't eaten yet,
maybe we can go and,,, get a bite,

482
00:39:29,332 --> 00:39:31,823
Someplace close,
You know, I saw a Chinese over here,

483
00:39:31,901 --> 00:39:36,736
We could use chopsticks and drop
an endless variety of things on our clothes,

484
00:39:36,806 --> 00:39:40,173
I'm sorry,
I prefer not to socialize with students,

485
00:39:40,777 --> 00:39:42,802
Oh, OK, All right,

486
00:39:43,313 --> 00:39:46,441
I shouldn't have taken this from you,
I'll buy you a new one,

487
00:39:46,516 --> 00:39:50,145
Please, I didn't,,,
I didn't mean anything by that,

488
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,988
I'll buy you a new one,

489
00:39:53,056 --> 00:39:55,047
Excuse me,

490
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:02,359
Mr, Clark, I take dance very seriously,

491
00:40:02,966 --> 00:40:06,094
Miss Mitzi's is a school, not a disco,

492
00:40:06,169 --> 00:40:08,637
And I hope you didn't join class
with me as your goal,

493
00:40:08,705 --> 00:40:11,765
because you'd be wasting your time,

494
00:40:12,509 --> 00:40:15,774
Don't dance if that's what you're after,

495
00:40:33,963 --> 00:40:36,955
Dance lessons?
My husband is taking dance lessons?

496
00:40:37,033 --> 00:40:39,467
Well, I've found a lot worse
hiding in the potpourri over the years,

497
00:40:39,536 --> 00:40:40,628
Consider yourself lucky,

498
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:43,264
What's this beautiful young woman?
Who's she?

499
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:46,434
His substitute teacher,
His regular teacher's a much older woman,

500
00:40:46,509 --> 00:40:48,841
Great legs, but older,

501
00:40:48,912 --> 00:40:53,576
Mr, Devine, what would make a man who's
done the same thing for the last 20 years

502
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:57,279
suddenly do something so completely
out of character just out of the blue?

503
00:40:57,354 --> 00:40:59,618
That's a question for a shrink,
I'm just a detective,

504
00:40:59,689 --> 00:41:04,422
I'm not asking you as a detective,
I'm asking you as a man,

505
00:41:10,033 --> 00:41:12,831
Scottie?
What would cause a man after 20 years

506
00:41:12,902 --> 00:41:14,995
to do something completely
out of character out of the blue?

507
00:41:15,071 --> 00:41:17,539
- Did I get that right?
- Yeah,

508
00:41:19,876 --> 00:41:23,937
"The mass of men
lead lives of quiet desperation,"

509
00:41:24,013 --> 00:41:26,846
Maybe the desperation
can't be quiet anymore,

510
00:41:26,916 --> 00:41:28,247
Bingo,

511
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:30,684
That's a wonderful use of Thoreau, Scottie,

512
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:32,984
Thank you, Hello again, Mrs, Clark,

513
00:41:33,056 --> 00:41:34,785
Hey,

514
00:41:36,025 --> 00:41:38,653
- Desperation,
- Well, that's a possibility,

515
00:41:38,728 --> 00:41:41,356
Mrs, Clark, the point is
your husband's dancing,

516
00:41:41,431 --> 00:41:43,092
he's not checking into hotel rooms,

517
00:41:43,166 --> 00:41:45,327
We can continue
to keep an eye on things for you,

518
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:49,498
but my guess is your husband will hang up
his dancing shoes shortly anyway,

519
00:41:49,572 --> 00:41:54,168
- What makes you say that?
- Voice of experience, (chuckles)

520
00:41:54,244 --> 00:41:57,577
You give him some time,
He'll be home soon,

521
00:42:06,556 --> 00:42:11,493
"The rest is up to you, " I tell my clients.
"The rest is up to you. "

522
00:42:12,295 --> 00:42:14,092
Every few years they come back,

523
00:42:14,164 --> 00:42:19,295
so I have these snapshots in my head
of how they've changed over the years.

524
00:42:19,369 --> 00:42:25,899
The ones who've changed the most finally
bought that boat, moved to that island.

525
00:42:25,975 --> 00:42:28,136
Those who haven't changed,

526
00:42:28,211 --> 00:42:32,841
I suppose they take comfort
in knowing what course their lives are on.

527
00:42:32,916 --> 00:42:36,750
They like to believe
they know what lies ahead.

528
00:42:39,722 --> 00:42:41,121
Shit!

529
00:43:05,648 --> 00:43:07,377
Dad!

530
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:09,918
Evan! What are you doing here?

531
00:43:09,986 --> 00:43:13,422
Trying to meet up with some friends,
What are you doing here?

532
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:14,980
Well, you know, work,,,

533
00:43:15,058 --> 00:43:18,516
I had to come to visit a client over here,
I had to come by and,,,

534
00:43:18,595 --> 00:43:21,689
- It's really weird,
- It is?

535
00:43:21,764 --> 00:43:25,860
Yeah, Because I've been wanting you
to meet this girl that I'm crazy about,

536
00:43:25,935 --> 00:43:30,429
and I'm going to meet her right now
at this bar with my other friends,

537
00:43:30,507 --> 00:43:33,499
So can you,,, Do you wanna go?

538
00:43:34,477 --> 00:43:37,469
Of course I do,
Lead on, my son,

539
00:43:38,047 --> 00:43:40,481
(¡ì disco rapping)

540
00:43:52,996 --> 00:43:55,487
Come on, let's get out there,

541
00:43:56,533 --> 00:43:59,058
So, does your dad wanna dance?

542
00:43:59,135 --> 00:44:02,468
I don't know, Dad, you haven't danced
in, what, 90 years?

543
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:06,066
You two go, Go,
It's been a long day for me,

544
00:44:26,462 --> 00:44:28,453
(music fades)

545
00:44:31,801 --> 00:44:33,792
(woman) Mr, Clark?

546
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:36,135
Mr, Clark?

547
00:44:36,339 --> 00:44:38,466
Do you wanna dance?

548
00:44:41,678 --> 00:44:44,078
Yes, Yes, I do,

549
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:45,369
OK,

550
00:44:45,448 --> 00:44:47,746
Could you say goodbye to Evan for me?
Thank you,

551
00:44:47,817 --> 00:44:49,785
Sure,

552
00:44:58,928 --> 00:45:00,919
(Latin music)

553
00:45:01,564 --> 00:45:05,125
- Sorry I'm late,
- (Miss Mitzi) Don't let it happen again,

554
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:10,104
Join the warm-up, John,

555
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:53,012
(Latin music)

556
00:46:00,089 --> 00:46:02,216
(inaudible)

557
00:46:14,637 --> 00:46:16,468
Come on!

558
00:46:16,539 --> 00:46:18,404
Christ, Vern!

559
00:46:18,474 --> 00:46:19,532
(music off)

560
00:46:19,609 --> 00:46:23,010
You're soaking wet, man,
I already had a shower today,

561
00:46:23,079 --> 00:46:25,809
- Sorry,
- You're disgusting!

562
00:46:25,882 --> 00:46:27,816
You don't have to put it like that,

563
00:46:27,884 --> 00:46:30,580
Why not? It's the truth,
And I prefer to tell the truth,

564
00:46:30,653 --> 00:46:34,589
unlike some people who make up stories
about nonexistent fianc¨¦es,

565
00:46:34,657 --> 00:46:37,057
What are you talking about?
He's getting married in the fall,

566
00:46:37,126 --> 00:46:39,185
Oh, come on, What, are ya dumb?

567
00:46:39,262 --> 00:46:42,754
People who are engaged take the classes
together, or what the hell's the point?

568
00:46:42,832 --> 00:46:47,997
Come on, tell the people the truth,
You're not engaged, are you?

569
00:46:48,071 --> 00:46:49,231
Huh?

570
00:46:49,305 --> 00:46:51,330
- Not exactly,
- Uh-huh,

571
00:46:52,341 --> 00:46:56,437
- I haven't asked her quite yet,
- Thank you very much,

572
00:46:59,515 --> 00:47:02,609
Look, I was gonna lose some weight first,

573
00:47:02,685 --> 00:47:07,588
and then I was gonna take her dancing
somewhere romantic,

574
00:47:07,657 --> 00:47:10,421
And then maybe pop the question,

575
00:47:11,828 --> 00:47:16,265
But I guess if I'm sweating all over the
place, that wouldn't be too romantic, huh?

576
00:47:16,966 --> 00:47:19,230
She's a great dancer,

577
00:47:19,702 --> 00:47:21,693
(groans)

578
00:47:22,171 --> 00:47:25,971
Well, hey, don't listen to me,
What, are you,,,

579
00:47:27,944 --> 00:47:33,109
C'mon, don't be a big baby, I didn't mean
to upset you or anything, Jesus, Vern,

580
00:47:34,951 --> 00:47:37,215
I said I was sorry,

581
00:47:38,955 --> 00:47:40,286
Bobbie!

582
00:47:41,724 --> 00:47:43,817
Somebody call a doctor,

583
00:47:43,893 --> 00:47:46,384
Are you all right? She's out,

584
00:47:48,231 --> 00:47:52,133
It's her electrolytes, They get crazy
because she overworks herself,

585
00:47:52,201 --> 00:47:55,034
She's been in here twice before,

586
00:47:55,104 --> 00:47:57,595
And it'sgetting so boring, Mom.

587
00:47:57,673 --> 00:48:01,006
- Shut up, Tina,
- No, you shut up, God, she pisses me off,

588
00:48:01,077 --> 00:48:04,877
She pulls a 1 2-hour shift at Jimmy's Diner,
working five till five,

589
00:48:04,947 --> 00:48:07,745
and then she goes and cooks and cleans
for an old feeb in a wheelchair

590
00:48:07,817 --> 00:48:10,115
to earn extra money
for her crazy costumes,

591
00:48:10,186 --> 00:48:13,883
And then she plays Cinderella
every night at dance practice,

592
00:48:13,956 --> 00:48:17,323
- When you should be home, resting,
- I don't need rest,

593
00:48:17,393 --> 00:48:20,829
Right, You need to hang out and flirt with
the shy guy with the nice-smelling sweat,

594
00:48:20,897 --> 00:48:23,457
- She told me all about you,
- Shut up, Tina,

595
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:26,093
I never said his sweat smells nice,
I never said,,,

596
00:48:26,169 --> 00:48:28,729
She said it was the best-smelling sweat
she'd ever smelled,

597
00:48:28,805 --> 00:48:29,931
OK, kill me now,

598
00:48:30,006 --> 00:48:34,272
It's all right, Bobbie, I've smelled his sweat
and I agree, it's not bad,

599
00:48:34,343 --> 00:48:37,335
Well, I mean, it's no field of flowers
after a spring rain,,,

600
00:48:37,413 --> 00:48:39,745
Yeah, I think we've talked
about this enough,

601
00:48:39,816 --> 00:48:43,513
Maybe we should all go home now
and let Bobbie get some rest,

602
00:48:43,586 --> 00:48:45,144
- Yeah,
- Bye, sweetheart,

603
00:48:45,221 --> 00:48:48,213
Thank you, Thank you,

604
00:49:02,004 --> 00:49:05,701
Bobbie needs a partner for the competition,

605
00:49:05,775 --> 00:49:08,005
Why not you, John?

606
00:49:08,077 --> 00:49:13,879
Me? Competition? No, no, I can't,,,
She'd never go for it anyway, Forget it,

607
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:18,751
Why not? What are you talking about?
You heard her daughter - she likes you,

608
00:49:18,821 --> 00:49:22,313
And dance begins
with the dancers' feelings,

609
00:49:22,391 --> 00:49:26,225
I'll work with the both of you after class,
Two extra hours,

610
00:49:26,295 --> 00:49:30,391
The Miss Mitzi Special,
We've got three months,

611
00:49:31,701 --> 00:49:33,828
This is good,

612
00:49:39,976 --> 00:49:42,035
What do you think?

613
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:47,277
I think you better stock up on deodorant,

614
00:49:54,957 --> 00:49:59,189
Anything a client says
in a lawyer's office is confidential.

615
00:49:59,262 --> 00:50:02,629
So I've gotten used
to holding onto secrets.

616
00:50:02,698 --> 00:50:05,098
They're usually nothing incriminating,

617
00:50:05,167 --> 00:50:09,627
but a lot of people have accounts
they haven't reconciled -

618
00:50:09,705 --> 00:50:12,970
things they're just not ready to share.

619
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:24,716
I took the liberty of ordering for you,
Bombay Sapphire, three limes,

620
00:50:24,787 --> 00:50:27,950
I hired you to watch my husband,
You're not supposed to be watching me,

621
00:50:28,024 --> 00:50:30,891
It's very hard not to, Mrs, Clark -
with all due respect,

622
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,690
- Are you a married man, Mr, Devine?
- I was,

623
00:50:33,763 --> 00:50:36,732
- Oh, what happened?
- Unfaithful,

624
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,500
- She hired a detective?
- No, no, no,

625
00:50:39,568 --> 00:50:43,470
When she found out,
I was too far gone, so,,,

626
00:50:43,539 --> 00:50:45,939
You're smiling at me,

627
00:50:46,008 --> 00:50:48,602
You are on a strange journey
to redemption, Mr, Devine,

628
00:50:48,678 --> 00:50:51,306
And a very long one, Mrs, Clark,

629
00:50:55,117 --> 00:50:57,244
All these promises
that we make and we break,

630
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,618
Why is it, do you think,
that people get married?

631
00:50:59,689 --> 00:51:02,385
- Passion,
- No,

632
00:51:02,458 --> 00:51:07,395
That's interesting, Because I would've
taken you for a romantic, Why, then?

633
00:51:08,798 --> 00:51:11,358
Because we need a witness to our lives,

634
00:51:11,434 --> 00:51:16,167
There's a billion people on the planet, l
mean, what does any one life really mean?

635
00:51:16,238 --> 00:51:21,835
But in a marriage, you're promising
to care about everything -

636
00:51:21,911 --> 00:51:26,109
the good things, the bad things,
the terrible things, the mundane things,,,

637
00:51:26,182 --> 00:51:28,742
Allofit.Allthetime,everyday.

638
00:51:28,818 --> 00:51:34,950
You're saying, "Your life will not
go unnoticed, because I will notice it,

639
00:51:35,024 --> 00:51:39,825
"Your life will not go unwitnessed,
because I will be your witness,"

640
00:51:43,532 --> 00:51:46,228
You can quote me on that, if you like,

641
00:51:46,836 --> 00:51:48,133
I'm sure I will,

642
00:51:48,204 --> 00:51:50,968
Anyway, the reason
that I called you here today,

643
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:54,373
to tell you in person that I won't
be needing your services anymore,

644
00:51:54,443 --> 00:51:55,637
Oh,

645
00:51:55,711 --> 00:51:57,178
I think to continue

646
00:51:57,246 --> 00:52:02,081
would be an unwarranted invasion
of my husband's privacy and,,,

647
00:52:02,151 --> 00:52:04,779
Anyway, even though there was a reason,,,

648
00:52:04,854 --> 00:52:09,484
I'm sorry for what I've done
and I know enough now and,,,

649
00:52:10,326 --> 00:52:12,453
it's time to stop,

650
00:52:13,729 --> 00:52:17,028
Thank you for everything and,,, goodbye,

651
00:52:17,099 --> 00:52:18,862
Bye,

652
00:52:21,871 --> 00:52:23,862
Mrs, Clark?

653
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:27,909
I was right, You are a romantic,

654
00:52:32,648 --> 00:52:35,446
(up-tempo Latin music)

655
00:52:37,286 --> 00:52:38,981
Bobbie!

656
00:52:39,055 --> 00:52:41,114
- A new costume,
- Yeah,

657
00:52:41,190 --> 00:52:43,590
I got it from this mermaid dream
I had in the hospital,

658
00:52:43,659 --> 00:52:45,559
Just floated up from my subconscious,

659
00:52:45,628 --> 00:52:48,722
Where, tragically, it did not stay,

660
00:52:50,266 --> 00:52:53,099
Come on, partner,
What are you waiting for?

661
00:52:53,169 --> 00:52:55,399
Divine intervention?

662
00:52:55,471 --> 00:53:00,704
You're a brave man, John Clark, Not
just anyone could take on the Bobbinator,

663
00:53:00,776 --> 00:53:01,834
Yeah,

664
00:53:01,911 --> 00:53:03,970
Good luck, man, We're with you,

665
00:53:04,046 --> 00:53:08,107
Somebody help me up! Please?

666
00:53:09,118 --> 00:53:11,086
John!

667
00:53:13,756 --> 00:53:19,854
OK, 55 days from today you two
are gonna win the novice competition,

668
00:53:19,929 --> 00:53:22,898
That means you're gonna
have to master five dances,

669
00:53:22,965 --> 00:53:25,934
I've asked Paulina
to videotape you tonight,

670
00:53:26,001 --> 00:53:28,401
so you can see what you're doing wrong,

671
00:53:28,471 --> 00:53:31,099
Let's start with a rumba,

672
00:53:32,108 --> 00:53:34,542
(music starts)

673
00:53:57,066 --> 00:53:59,466
- What? What is it?
- (music off)

674
00:53:59,535 --> 00:54:03,164
It's the rumba,
It's the dance of love,

675
00:54:04,306 --> 00:54:06,797
And he'sjustnotgiving meanything.

676
00:54:06,876 --> 00:54:09,811
What does she want me to do?
I'm doing it exactly the way I was taught,

677
00:54:09,879 --> 00:54:11,039
You think it's easy,,,?

678
00:54:11,113 --> 00:54:16,642
The rumba,,, is a vertical expression
of a horizontal wish,

679
00:54:16,719 --> 00:54:22,555
You have to hold her like the skin
on her thigh is your reason for living,

680
00:54:23,425 --> 00:54:28,021
Let her go like your heart's
being ripped from your chest,

681
00:54:28,931 --> 00:54:35,564
Pull her back like you're gonna have your
way with her, right here on the dance floor,

682
00:54:35,638 --> 00:54:38,038
- And then finish,,,
- (thump)

683
00:54:39,341 --> 00:54:42,139
Iike she's ruined you for life,

684
00:54:42,211 --> 00:54:43,803
(pants)

685
00:54:55,558 --> 00:54:58,322
See? Why can't you just do it like that?

686
00:54:59,295 --> 00:55:02,594
Anyone else care for a glass of water?

687
00:55:05,401 --> 00:55:06,459
Damn it!

688
00:55:06,535 --> 00:55:08,127
No, not you,

689
00:55:08,204 --> 00:55:11,139
Look, I have to call you back,

690
00:55:11,207 --> 00:55:13,368
No, he's not home yet,

691
00:55:20,149 --> 00:55:22,982
What was the score at half-time
in the NBA playoffs last night?

692
00:55:23,052 --> 00:55:23,916
Why?

693
00:55:23,986 --> 00:55:25,783
Why? You said you watched,
What was the score?

694
00:55:25,854 --> 00:55:28,880
- I forget now,
- You didn't forget, You didn't watch,

695
00:55:28,958 --> 00:55:31,825
You don't care about playoffs,
You care about dancing!

696
00:55:31,894 --> 00:55:33,327
Shh!

697
00:55:33,395 --> 00:55:34,862
I do not,

698
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:36,761
Yeah? Then what's this?

699
00:55:36,832 --> 00:55:40,199
Give me that! No!
Give me that! Give me,,,

700
00:55:40,269 --> 00:55:42,794
It's not even mine, It's my mother's,

701
00:55:44,673 --> 00:55:47,733
At least, it was my mother's until I took it
to this wonderful alterations guy

702
00:55:47,810 --> 00:55:50,244
who had it tailored for me,

703
00:55:51,547 --> 00:55:54,380
Look, it's not like I've figured this out either,

704
00:55:54,450 --> 00:55:57,613
- Hey, listen,,,
- What?

705
00:55:57,686 --> 00:55:59,210
- Come back to class,
- No,

706
00:55:59,288 --> 00:56:02,780
You could take over as Bobbie's partner
in the Latin dances,

707
00:56:02,858 --> 00:56:06,225
You've got those knocked already,
There's no way I could learn 'em in time,

708
00:56:06,295 --> 00:56:08,820
I'm not comin' back
as the Bobbinator's partner!

709
00:56:08,897 --> 00:56:11,365
We'll look like an olive
and a toothpick together,

710
00:56:11,433 --> 00:56:13,663
Besides, she would never dance with me,

711
00:56:13,736 --> 00:56:15,533
Sure she would,

712
00:56:15,604 --> 00:56:19,973
Just the Latin dances,
I'll still do the waltz and the quickstep,

713
00:56:20,042 --> 00:56:21,907
She would,

714
00:56:22,311 --> 00:56:23,869
No!

715
00:56:23,946 --> 00:56:28,280
Not if he was the last bald, bad-breathed,
heterosexual sequin-freak on earth -

716
00:56:28,350 --> 00:56:30,682
which he probably is,
I'm not doin' it,

717
00:56:30,753 --> 00:56:34,086
You wanna win the Latin competition
or not? It's up to you, I don't care,

718
00:56:34,156 --> 00:56:38,149
Link already knows the dances,
And he'll be a good competitor,

719
00:56:38,227 --> 00:56:40,218
Right, Link?

720
00:56:47,569 --> 00:56:50,663
So, finally giving up
on the underage bimbettes

721
00:56:50,739 --> 00:56:52,866
and gonna go for a real woman?
Is that it?

722
00:56:52,941 --> 00:56:58,573
Yeah, no more underage bimbettes for me,
Only real women from now on,

723
00:56:58,647 --> 00:57:04,279
Don't even think about coming near me
without a breath mint, You got that?

724
00:57:04,353 --> 00:57:07,186
And quit lookin' at my ass,

725
00:57:07,256 --> 00:57:09,656
(both) We'll try,

726
00:57:09,725 --> 00:57:14,355
Vern, you know,
there's a joyful freedom in your Latin,

727
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:19,390
And Chic, you have an innate sensuality
quite uncommon in a man,

728
00:57:20,402 --> 00:57:24,236
I've entered you both in the competition
along with John,

729
00:57:26,075 --> 00:57:28,009
Good, That's settled,

730
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,578
(musical interlude)

731
00:57:49,531 --> 00:57:51,897
You,,, are the frame,

732
00:57:51,967 --> 00:57:53,434
I'm the frame,

733
00:57:53,502 --> 00:57:57,598
- She is the picture,,,
- She is the picture,,,

734
00:57:57,673 --> 00:57:59,732
,,,in your frame,

735
00:57:59,808 --> 00:58:03,266
Everything that you do
is to show her off,

736
00:58:03,912 --> 00:58:06,244
- You got that?
- I didn't hear that,

737
00:58:20,629 --> 00:58:23,063
Nice, lnvite the lady in,

738
00:58:23,899 --> 00:58:26,800
And... maketheconnection.

739
00:58:30,539 --> 00:58:33,235
Projecting to the third balcony,

740
00:58:35,744 --> 00:58:38,008
91 1! 91 1, quick!

741
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:40,446
Quick, 91 1! 9,,,

742
00:58:40,516 --> 00:58:42,746
(both laugh)

743
00:58:43,185 --> 00:58:47,178
And start here
with an initial sweep past the crowd,

744
00:58:47,256 --> 00:58:49,247
Watch,

745
00:58:53,829 --> 00:58:55,820
And contra-check

746
00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:07,233
Excellent,

747
00:59:52,554 --> 00:59:55,045
Oh, Jesus,

748
00:59:55,123 --> 00:59:56,715
We wanted something unusual,

749
00:59:56,792 --> 00:59:58,123
- Are you OK?
- Yeah,

750
00:59:58,193 --> 00:59:59,524
- You sure?
- No, I'm good,

751
00:59:59,595 --> 01:00:02,792
But you guys look exhausted,

752
01:00:02,865 --> 01:00:06,426
I tell you what, why don't we call it a night?

753
01:00:06,502 --> 01:00:10,029
For your sake, John,
You look like you're toast,

754
01:00:10,105 --> 01:00:13,302
- And tomorrow's a big day,
- Yeah,

755
01:00:13,375 --> 01:00:15,206
- Get home safe,
- OK,

756
01:00:15,878 --> 01:00:17,971
- I'm wearing you guys out,
- No, No, no, no,

757
01:00:18,046 --> 01:00:22,915
It's good, I like it when my feet hurt,
Takes my mind off my knees,

758
01:00:22,985 --> 01:00:27,046
I've just been getting carried away, you
know, working hard with the two of you,

759
01:00:27,122 --> 01:00:30,523
I guess I like it, Feels good, you know?

760
01:00:30,592 --> 01:00:32,560
For me too,

761
01:00:33,695 --> 01:00:37,062
All right.Well, I'm going home.

762
01:00:37,132 --> 01:00:39,327
Hey, wait,

763
01:00:42,304 --> 01:00:46,502
I wanted to talk to you about that night
that you asked me to dinner,

764
01:00:46,575 --> 01:00:49,908
I'm sorry about how I treated you,

765
01:00:50,746 --> 01:00:53,943
It's just, you know, that people
get the wrong idea about me all the time,

766
01:00:54,016 --> 01:00:57,042
Paulina, you don't have to explain
anything to me, ever,

767
01:00:57,119 --> 01:01:00,316
Well, I know I don't have to explain
anything to anybody

768
01:01:00,389 --> 01:01:02,289
because I don't care
what people think about me,

769
01:01:02,357 --> 01:01:04,825
Good, Good,

770
01:01:04,893 --> 01:01:08,761
- I mean it,
- Yeah, uh-huh, Good, Good,

771
01:01:13,936 --> 01:01:16,336
(breathes heavily)

772
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:21,238
I'm sorry, I shouldn't be here right now,

773
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:26,976
No, it's OK,
I think I'm just hungry or something,

774
01:01:30,886 --> 01:01:33,081
- Hungry?
- Very,

775
01:01:35,591 --> 01:01:38,185
- Oh, this is so stupid,
- No,

776
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:41,491
No, not at all, No, no,
I cry too when I'm hungry,

777
01:01:41,563 --> 01:01:44,225
For French fries, usually, You?

778
01:01:45,567 --> 01:01:47,125
Cake,

779
01:01:47,202 --> 01:01:49,193
(both laugh)

780
01:01:51,707 --> 01:01:54,267
Careful, Don't spill it on your new coat,

781
01:01:54,343 --> 01:01:57,540
- Old coat, new color, I had it dyed,
- Yeah?

782
01:01:57,613 --> 01:02:00,514
Yeah, my dad did it, He's a dry-cleaner,

783
01:02:00,582 --> 01:02:04,712
As is my mom, my brother,
my two older sisters and me,

784
01:02:04,786 --> 01:02:07,152
I told you I know about stains,

785
01:02:07,222 --> 01:02:12,091
- You're a dry-cleaner?
- Well, I was, Until I was eight,

786
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,890
Actually, that's when I started dancing,

787
01:02:14,963 --> 01:02:17,625
I was helping out in the store
one day after school

788
01:02:17,699 --> 01:02:20,691
when my mom asked me
to go in the back and get an order,

789
01:02:20,769 --> 01:02:26,867
It was this incredibly delicate sequined
thing, held together by a gold thread,

790
01:02:26,942 --> 01:02:30,969
Well, I carried the costume
like it was gonna break.

791
01:02:31,046 --> 01:02:33,480
And then I saw the customer.

792
01:02:33,548 --> 01:02:38,144
She was the most beautiful woman
I had ever laid eyes on.

793
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:43,954
She invited us to see her dance that night,
and my mother said yes.

794
01:02:46,328 --> 01:02:52,130
It was like the whole world had suddenly
gone from black-and-white to color.

795
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:55,863
The beautiful woman and her partner
stopped right in front of us

796
01:02:55,937 --> 01:02:58,531
and did a waltz pose.

797
01:02:58,607 --> 01:03:02,737
She tilted her head back
and she winked at me.

798
01:03:03,845 --> 01:03:07,713
And I felt like she was trying
to tell me something.

799
01:03:07,783 --> 01:03:10,149
I took it as a sign.

800
01:03:10,218 --> 01:03:15,656
And from then on, I knew
that ballroom dancing would be my life.

801
01:03:21,163 --> 01:03:24,724
It wasn't the kind of dream
my parents had in mind,

802
01:03:26,301 --> 01:03:28,769
What made you wanna dance?

803
01:03:29,404 --> 01:03:31,395
You,

804
01:03:33,008 --> 01:03:36,466
Looking out that window, right up there,

805
01:03:37,713 --> 01:03:40,580
You can see it from the train and,,,

806
01:03:41,483 --> 01:03:47,547
every night I'd come home from work
and I'd look for you, your face,

807
01:03:49,291 --> 01:03:53,728
You looked on the outside
the way I was feeling on the inside,

808
01:03:53,795 --> 01:03:55,888
I was watching you too,

809
01:03:55,964 --> 01:03:58,228
From the window
I saw you practicing on the platform,

810
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:00,291
No! Oh,,,

811
01:04:04,639 --> 01:04:10,771
That night I said all those things to you,
I didn't think I'd ever see you again,

812
01:04:13,081 --> 01:04:15,606
But you kept coming back,

813
01:04:15,684 --> 01:04:17,743
I didn'twant to,

814
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:23,689
But I figured if I hadn't, you'd have been
right about everything you accused me of,

815
01:04:23,759 --> 01:04:27,320
Then I started dancing and I found
I really liked it, It made me happy,

816
01:04:27,395 --> 01:04:29,522
Yes, it shows,

817
01:04:29,598 --> 01:04:35,161
I mean, I feel excited about something
for the first time in such a long time,

818
01:04:35,237 --> 01:04:36,829
- Aren't you?
- Excited?

819
01:04:36,905 --> 01:04:39,965
About tomorrow, The competition,

820
01:04:40,041 --> 01:04:43,033
No, no, no, I'm petrified, I'm,,,

821
01:04:43,845 --> 01:04:46,780
I'm gonna forget everything, I won't be able
to put one foot in front of the other,

822
01:04:46,848 --> 01:04:50,147
- I'll make a mess of the whole thing,
- No,

823
01:04:55,190 --> 01:04:57,658
Give me one hour,

824
01:05:01,329 --> 01:05:04,662
(¡ì "Santa Maria" - Go Tan Project)

825
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:08,460
Leave it, Leave the light,

826
01:05:14,376 --> 01:05:17,834
Don't say anything,,, and don't think,

827
01:05:20,549 --> 01:05:23,746
And don't move unless you feel it,

828
01:07:51,733 --> 01:07:54,031
Be this alive,

829
01:07:57,439 --> 01:08:00,169
Be this alive tomorrow,

830
01:08:14,389 --> 01:08:16,414
Thank you,

831
01:09:17,986 --> 01:09:20,352
God, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I lost my balance,

832
01:09:20,422 --> 01:09:22,151
Oh, that's OK, I lost my fianc¨¦,

833
01:09:22,223 --> 01:09:23,520

841
01:09:49,317 --> 01:09:52,286
Even I got a partner, Check it out,

842
01:09:52,353 --> 01:09:54,321
Cute,

843
01:09:54,389 --> 01:09:58,450
- But who's the guy?
- Oh, that's her brother,

844
01:10:00,161 --> 01:10:03,028
Yeah, we play basketball together,

845
01:10:09,537 --> 01:10:13,029
Aren't they adorable?
They're gonna get slaughtered,

846
01:10:13,108 --> 01:10:15,269

847
01:10:17,245 --> 01:10:19,236

We danced like shit!
All you did was worry about that stupid wig!

862
01:12:26,107 --> 01:12:28,132
Well, what did you expect me to do?
You saw,,,

863
01:12:28,209 --> 01:12:30,439
I know, he's a pig,
But you know what? This is Latin,

864
01:12:30,511 --> 01:12:32,809
The judges are looking at your hips,
not your hair,

865
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:36,839
So unless that thing
looks good on your ass, lose it!

866
01:12:37,452 --> 01:12:39,443
Fine!

867

Music, please,

873
01:13:23,898 --> 01:13:26,492
Looks like he got rid
of a lot more than the wig,

874
01:14:34,736 --> 01:14:38,638

(cheering)

885
01:15:12,073 --> 01:15:14,371
I thought Slick Willy was pretty good,

886
01:15:14,442 --> 01:15:18,811
Bad attitude, Ungentlemanly behavior,
It's a British sport, after all,

Come on, come on, we're gonna be late,

905
01:16:15,870 --> 01:16:17,861
Hey, you're not gonna
choke on me, are you?

906
01:16:17,939 --> 01:16:19,873

You invited them?

912
01:16:50,838 --> 01:16:52,772
She said she wanted
to be a witness to her husband's life,

913
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:54,865
I thought she should witness this,

914
01:16:54,942 --> 01:17:01,142
So you're a marriage counselor now, But
could you at least bill Mrs, Clark for that?

915
01:17:02,049 --> 01:17:04,847
As our dancers take their positions
for their first dance,

916
01:17:04,919 --> 01:17:11,290
I'd like to remind the judges that you'll be
recalling six couples for the final round,

917
01:17:11,359 --> 01:17:15,693
Ladies and gentlemen,
your first dance is the waltz,

918
01:17:17,865 --> 01:17:20,197
Music, please,

919
01:17:38,519 --> 01:17:40,885
(applause)

920
01:17:46,427 --> 01:17:48,691
Well done!

921
01:17:57,104 --> 01:17:59,095
He's awesome,

922
01:17:59,807 --> 01:18:02,105
Dad is awesome!

923
01:18:33,641 --> 01:18:35,632
Spectacular,

924
01:18:36,978 --> 01:18:38,809
It's spectacular,

925
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:01,998
(piece ends / rapturous applause)

926
01:19:09,510 --> 01:19:13,105
- 1 1 6!
- Whoo!

927
01:19:21,222 --> 01:19:23,486
Way to go, Dad!

928
01:19:28,562 --> 01:19:30,723
(compere) Such a beautiful waltz,

929
01:19:30,798 --> 01:19:32,698
We weren't terrible, I can't believe it,

930
01:19:32,767 --> 01:19:35,600
Of course we weren't -
you were dancing with me, you big nut,

931
01:19:35,670 --> 01:19:39,504
,,,the second and final dance
of this competition, the quickstep!

932
01:19:39,573 --> 01:19:42,041
(drum and trumpet intro)

933
01:19:48,149 --> 01:19:51,380
- Hey, is your daughter here tonight?
- No, Why?

934
01:19:51,452 --> 01:19:54,319
I thought I heard someone
yell at you "Go, Dad,"

935
01:19:54,388 --> 01:19:56,413
(quickstep starts)

936
01:20:18,879 --> 01:20:20,608
Yes!

937
01:20:36,731 --> 01:20:38,221
1 26!

938
01:20:38,599 --> 01:20:40,590
Go, Dad!

939
01:20:49,310 --> 01:20:51,141
Way to go, Dad!

940
01:20:53,347 --> 01:20:55,941
(sudden silence)

941
01:20:59,386 --> 01:21:01,786
(gasps and some laughter)

942
01:21:56,277 --> 01:21:58,142
- Beverly!
- Dad,

943
01:21:58,212 --> 01:22:00,703
- Wait a minute, Wait, wait,
- Dad, you were terrific,

944
01:22:00,781 --> 01:22:03,511
Get in the car, Jen, Just get in the car,

945
01:22:03,584 --> 01:22:06,109
Beverly, how did you know?

946
01:22:06,187 --> 01:22:09,623
Because I hired a detective, Yeah,
I thought you were having an affair,

947
01:22:09,690 --> 01:22:13,148
- It's ridiculous, I know, OK, I feel,,,
- Hey, listen, that was really bad luck,

948
01:22:13,227 --> 01:22:15,286
Don't worry, There's always next year,

949
01:22:15,362 --> 01:22:19,594
Oh, "there's always next year," Thanks,
Well, I have a whole year to prepare for it,

950
01:22:19,667 --> 01:22:22,602
- Beverly, please, can we talk,,,
- No, there's nothing to talk about,

951
01:22:22,670 --> 01:22:25,901
Please, Will you please stay here,,,

952
01:22:27,575 --> 01:22:29,133
(horn blast)

953
01:22:29,210 --> 01:22:31,770
Stop, No,

954
01:22:31,846 --> 01:22:34,007
- Please, will you talk to me?
- If you want to talk,

955
01:22:34,081 --> 01:22:37,710
you can start by explaining what was it
that I just saw in there? What did I witness?

956
01:22:37,785 --> 01:22:39,719
I'm not having an affair, There was no aff,,,

957
01:22:39,787 --> 01:22:42,278
- What's goin' on?
- (horn blasts)

958
01:22:42,356 --> 01:22:44,381
- Let's go!
- They're new friends,

959
01:22:44,458 --> 01:22:48,292
But you could've told me about it, couldn't
you? You just completely left me out,

960
01:22:48,362 --> 01:22:51,525
Why didn't you tell me, John?
You've gotta answer that,

961
01:22:51,599 --> 01:22:54,033
- I was ashamed,
- Ashamed of what? Of dancing?

962
01:22:54,101 --> 01:22:56,831
- Well, no, no,,,
- Well, then of what?

963
01:22:57,605 --> 01:22:59,903
Of wanting to be happier,

964
01:23:00,908 --> 01:23:03,342
When we have so much,

965
01:23:04,945 --> 01:23:06,640
(horn blasts)

966
01:23:06,714 --> 01:23:09,239
And it's not your fault,

967
01:23:09,316 --> 01:23:13,685
Hey, Fred Astaire!
You're blocking traffic!

968
01:23:19,860 --> 01:23:22,090
Finally! Thank you!

969
01:23:37,845 --> 01:23:42,908
The reading of a will
can actually come as a kind of relief.

970
01:23:44,418 --> 01:23:49,355
After the initial shock wears off
about that trust fund for the family dog,

971
01:23:49,423 --> 01:23:52,756
or the opera seats left to the gardener,

972
01:23:52,826 --> 01:23:58,492
there is at least the sense
that everything is finally out on the table.

973
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:03,195
This, you are not gonna believe this, guys,
Louis, Louis,

974
01:24:03,270 --> 01:24:05,932
"Link started dancing in 1 985,

975
01:24:06,006 --> 01:24:10,102
"lt soon became his passion
and he started dancing six days a week,

976
01:24:10,177 --> 01:24:12,168
"Lawyer by day and dancer by night,

977
01:24:12,246 --> 01:24:15,181
"Link really lights up the floor
with all of his energy."

978
01:24:15,249 --> 01:24:19,447
See? I told you, I knew it,
I knew Link Peterson was a freaky bastard,

979
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:23,513
I think Linky Link might be batting
for the other team, you know what I mean?

980
01:24:24,358 --> 01:24:28,226
(woman) Could those pants
be any tighter? Look at his package!

981
01:24:28,295 --> 01:24:30,195
Somebody get a magnifying glass!

982
01:24:30,264 --> 01:24:35,258
There is nothing wrong
with ballroom dancing,

983
01:24:36,470 --> 01:24:40,236
(embarrassed titters and throat-clearing)

984
01:24:43,610 --> 01:24:45,601
Sorry,

985
01:24:47,781 --> 01:24:49,305
Oh,,,

986
01:24:50,651 --> 01:24:52,619
(she squeaks)

987
01:24:58,759 --> 01:25:00,954
Fuck you all,

988
01:25:01,729 --> 01:25:04,061
And football  sucks.

989
01:25:15,376 --> 01:25:16,934
- (Link) Hey, how you doin'?
- Hey,

990
01:25:17,011 --> 01:25:18,535
Surprise,

991
01:25:18,612 --> 01:25:20,876
- This is gorgeous,
- Yeah, it's a pretty spot,

992
01:25:20,948 --> 01:25:22,711
Thanks,

993
01:25:22,783 --> 01:25:24,546
John, look, we just wanted
to talk to you for a minute,

994
01:25:24,618 --> 01:25:28,145
Yeah, I just hope that you weren't
staying away from class on account of me,

995
01:25:28,222 --> 01:25:31,089
I'm not mad about you ripping my dress
or anything, Seriously,

996
01:25:31,158 --> 01:25:32,785
I mean, I know you always
wanted to look at my ass

997
01:25:32,860 --> 01:25:36,591
and I think you picked a pretty weird time
to do it, but I forgive you, John,

998
01:25:36,663 --> 01:25:38,858
- Thanks, Thank you,
- Honestly, OK?

999
01:25:38,932 --> 01:25:40,923
Come on, can we tell Miss Mitzi
you're coming back?

1000
01:25:41,001 --> 01:25:46,940
I'm sorry, guys, I'm not coming back,
It's,,, It's,,, I'm done with that now,

1001
01:25:47,007 --> 01:25:51,307
But thanks a lot for coming out here,
I really appreciate that,

1002
01:25:51,378 --> 01:25:53,403
John, look,,,

1003
01:25:53,480 --> 01:25:57,746
Paulina, you know, she's gonna
go to England to study dance,

1004
01:25:57,818 --> 01:26:01,515
and we're havin' a little, you know,
going-away party for her

1005
01:26:01,588 --> 01:26:06,787
and we'd love for you to come,
Really love it if you would come by,

1006
01:26:06,860 --> 01:26:09,920
She gave me this to give to you, so,,,

1007
01:26:14,735 --> 01:26:18,899
Anyway, we hope that we see you there,
All right?

1008
01:26:18,972 --> 01:26:20,633
All right,  come on.

1009

what happened with you and Bobbie.

"I'd hate to think that what happened
would make you give it all up.

"You looked so graceful
and brave out there -

a different person from the one
who first walked into Miss Mitzi's studio.

1015
01:26:51,638 --> 01:26:56,666
"But a lot has changed for both of us
over the last few months.

1016
01:26:58,545 --> 01:27:01,639
"When my partner and I
went to Blackpool last year,

1017
01:27:01,715 --> 01:27:05,173
we were so excited
to make it to the finals.

1018
01:27:07,387 --> 01:27:10,322
"Everyone was convinced
that we were going to win,

1019
01:27:10,390 --> 01:27:12,950
and we wanted to prove them right.

1020

"We'd been together as a couple
for as long as we'd been partners.

1021
01:27:16,864 --> 01:27:23,360
"But we began training too hard,
pushing each other, expecting too much.

1022
01:27:24,771 --> 01:27:28,969
"Well, we didn't win.
Not even close.

1023
01:27:31,745 --> 01:27:36,011
"I came back
without my trophy or my partner.

1024
01:27:36,717 --> 01:27:40,175
"And all this time
I've been hiding out at Miss Mitzi's,

1025
01:27:40,254 --> 01:27:44,623
angry at myself,
frustrated and embarrassed.

1026
01:27:46,860 --> 01:27:52,264
"But coaching you and Bobbie,
seeing how alive you were out there,

1027
01:27:52,332 --> 01:27:55,460
made me realize
just how much I'd given up.

1028
01:28:21,161 --> 01:28:25,791
"And now,
for the first time in a long time,

1029
01:28:27,234 --> 01:28:29,828
I want to dance again.

1030

"So I need to thank you - thank you
for helping me to see this.

with you once more before I leave.

Thanks,

1034
01:29:08,942 --> 01:29:11,672
By the way, I'm not going to this party,

1035
01:29:11,745 --> 01:29:13,406
Oh, OK,

1036
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:16,847
But you're not giving up dancing, are you?

1037
01:29:20,420 --> 01:29:23,878
You could,,, teach me to dance,

1038
01:29:26,827 --> 01:29:29,591
Beverly, I'm not dancing anymore,

1039
01:29:30,430 --> 01:29:32,295
Why not, Dad?

1040
01:29:34,101 --> 01:29:37,502
Why don't you teach Mom how to dance?

1041
01:29:56,657 --> 01:30:01,617
The one thing I am proudest of
in my whole life,,,

1042
01:30:03,697 --> 01:30:06,666
is that you are happy with me,

1043
01:30:06,733 --> 01:30:11,796
If I couldn't,,, if I couldn't tell you
that I was unhappy sometimes,

1044
01:30:11,872 --> 01:30:17,708
it was because I didn't want to risk hurting
the one person I treasure most,

1045
01:30:20,714 --> 01:30:22,841
I'm so sorry,

01:32:16,863 --> 01:32:21,197
¡ì The book of love is long and boring

1068
01:32:22,169 --> 01:32:25,935
¡ì And written very long ago

1069
01:32:27,841 --> 01:32:33,336
¡ì It's full of flowers
and heart-shaped boxes

1070
01:32:33,413 --> 01:32:38,248
¡ì And things we're all too young to know

1071

¡ì The book of love has music in it

1076

¡ì In fact, that's where music comes from

1077

¡ì Some of it's just transcendental...

1078
