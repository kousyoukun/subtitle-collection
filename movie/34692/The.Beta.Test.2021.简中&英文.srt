All right . So for months ,

37
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,164
我们试图联系那家伙的团队
we were trying to get in touch with the guy's team ,

38
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:48,907
我们想把这家伙签到经纪公司
we're trying to sign the guy to the agency .

39
00:07:48,917 --> 00:07:50,908
一直没有回复 我们竭尽所能
No answer . We're doing everything we can

40
00:07:51,042 --> 00:07:53,033
试图联系他的上司 所有能联系的人
trying to reach the guy's higher ups , everything .

41
00:07:53,042 --> 00:07:55,784
我们试了所有可能的电子邮件地址组合
We're trying every possible combination of email address ,

42
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,411
一点用也没有
doesn't work , nothing , all right ?

43
00:07:57,542 --> 00:08:00,739
我读了很多关于美第奇家族的书
So I've been reading a lot about the Medici family .

44
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,456
这些家伙 他们拥有世界上所有的钱
These guys , they got all the money in the world ,

45
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:03,948
他们与世隔绝
they're secluded from everVbody .

46
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,914
所以我在想
And I was thinking , and I was like ,

47
00:08:06,042 --> 00:08:07,782
这些有钱人
these rich people ,

48
00:08:07,917 --> 00:08:09,202
他们根本没有社交媒体
they don't have social media .

49
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,789
你不能和这些人联系
You can't get in touch with these people .

50
00:08:10,792 --> 00:08:13,033
他们没有Facebook之类的东西
They don't have Facebook or anything .

51
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,116
但是你可以假设这些混蛋肯定有Venmo
But you can bet these motherfuckers have Venmo .

52
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:16,535
但是你可以假设这些混蛋肯定有Venmo
But you can bet these motherfuckers have Venmo .

53
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,323
不可能
No

54
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,823
哦 是的 兄弟
oh , yeah , bro .

55
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:25,530
所以我给那家伙发Venmo请求 花了两便士
So I send the guy a Venmo request for two pennies

56
00:08:25,667 --> 00:08:28,500
希望他能让我和乔丹做他的经纪人
to get his two cents about Jordan and I being his agents .

57
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:30,789
有用吗
And that worked ?

58
00:08:30,917 --> 00:08:33,124
当然有用 所以我才点了香槟
Fuck yeah , it worked . That's why I ordered champagne .

59
00:08:33,292 --> 00:08:34,998
我们明天要和他的团队见面
We're meeting with his team tomorrow .

60
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,615
美丽的新世界
Brave new world .

61
00:08:36,792 --> 00:08:37,952
这合法吗
Is that legal ?

62
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:40,074
怎么 我们会有麻烦吗
What , are we gonna get in trouble ?

63
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:41,448
不好意思
Excuse me ,

64
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:43,244
你能给我们结下帐吗
could we get a check when you get a chance ?

65
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,036
4月11日就快到了
April 11th is coming up soon .

66
00:08:45,167 --> 00:08:47,123
你们婚礼计划得怎么样
Are you all deep into wedding plans ?

67
00:08:47,292 --> 00:08:48,623
是啊 还有不到两个月的时间
Yeah , less than two months .

68
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,581
要做的事情很多
Yeah，there's a lot .

69
00:08:51,917 --> 00:08:53,782
我们的家人
Our families

70
00:08:53,917 --> 00:08:55,999
我是我姐妹中最后一个结婚的
I'm the last of my sisters to get married

71
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:57,285
所以压力很大
So there's a lot of stress

72
00:08:57,417 --> 00:08:59,658
座位安排之类的
around where people are going to sit .

73
00:08:59,792 --> 00:09:01,202
但你会想起 这是一个开放的酒吧
But then you remember it's an open bar

74
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,415
几乎可以自己运转
and will practically run itself .

75
00:09:03,542 --> 00:09:05,828
如果一切都搞砸了 我们就离开
And if it does all fall apart , we're skipping town .

76
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:08,870
我们去度蜜月
We're doing a road trip honeymoon .

77
00:09:09,042 --> 00:09:11,283
这是我的主意
It was my idea .

78
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:13,457
哦 我那个和我们一起住的朋友
oh , that friend of mine that was staying with us...

79
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:16,120
- 我们可以告诉他们吗 - 可以 你可以告诉他们
- Are we allowed to tell them？- Yeah , you can tell'em .

80
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,831
我一个伯克利的朋友
okay , so a friend of mine from Berkeley ,

81
00:09:17,917 --> 00:09:20,158
她和我们住在一起 她是个空中乘务员
she was staying with us , right ? She's a flight attendant .

82
00:09:20,292 --> 00:09:23,329
她给我们讲了很多关于飞机上的疯狂故事
She was telling us all these crazy stories about flying .

83
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,665
像是他们打算把飞机翻个底朝天
Like they have plans to flip the plane upside down

84
00:09:25,792 --> 00:09:27,783
就只为了以防有恐怖分子 有时还不得不提前降落
in case there's a terrorist , and having to land early

85
00:09:27,792 --> 00:09:29,908
因为有些人有焦虑症
because of people having anxiety attacks ,

86
00:09:30,042 --> 00:09:32,408
非常有趣 非常疯狂
really interesting stuff , really insane .

87
00:09:32,542 --> 00:09:34,453
不管怎样 她给我们讲了一个故事
Anyway , she was telling us a story about

88
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:35,948
一次完全正常的飞行中
a totally normal flight ,

89
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,119
这个女人和她丈夫在头等舱
and this woman and her husband are in first class

90
00:09:38,292 --> 00:09:39,577
应该是去度蜜月 我猜啊
for their honeymoon , I guess ,

91
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:41,164
他们要下飞机了
and they're getting off the plane

92
00:09:41,292 --> 00:09:43,453
然后那个女人倒下了
and the woman collapses ,

93
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,824
年轻的女人 新婚夫妇
young woman , newlyweds .

94
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:48,199
显然她很漂亮 对吧
And she is beautiful apparently , right ?

95
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,870
他们发现她身上有血迹
They realize she's got blood on her ,

96
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,160
但她说她没事
but she says she's fine ,

97
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:53,782
没人知道发生了什么
nobody knows what's going on .

98
00:09:53,917 --> 00:09:55,407
美国运输安全管理局介入了
The TSA gets involved .

99
00:09:55,542 --> 00:09:59,205
他们意识到她身上的一些血迹已经干了
They realize that some of the blood has dried on her .

100
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,449
发现她和她丈夫
Turns out , she and her husband

101
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,824
他们吵了一架 天知道是为了什么
got into a fight about God knows what

102
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:05,664
然后用飞机上的香槟酒瓶
and he stabbed her in the ribs

103
00:10:05,792 --> 00:10:07,657
刺穿了她的肋骨
with an in-flight champagne bottle .

104
00:10:07,792 --> 00:10:10,454
所以他们都认为这是性交易 但事实并非如此
So they all think it's a sex trafficking thing but it's not .

105
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,790
他们把所有人都带走了 她告诉运输安全管理局
They bring everybody in . She tells the TSA

106
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:15,457
他们都从事着形象至上的工作
they both work in careers where image is everything

107
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,198
她只是不想让别人知道
and she just didn't want anybody to know

108
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:18,573
他们一直在吵架
that they'd been fighting .

109
00:10:19,542 --> 00:10:20,907
这是不是很疯狂
Isn't that insane ?

110
00:10:21,042 --> 00:10:23,249
非常感谢你们的光临
Thank you guys so much for coming in .

111
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:25,036
- 谢谢 - 非常感谢
- Thank you - Thank you so much .

112
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:26,907
- 谢谢 - 谢谢
- Thank you - Thank you .

113
00:10:27,917 --> 00:10:30,624
哦 你可以吗
oh , could you ?

114
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,286
我的意思是我只喝了一杯酒
I mean I only had one glass of wine .

115
00:10:32,417 --> 00:10:34,499
是吗 因为我觉得你喝了三四杯
Did you？ 'Cause I feel like you had about three or four .

116
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,037
通常那时你会开始讲你的长篇大论
That's when you usually start telling your long stories .

117
00:10:37,167 --> 00:10:39,328
我肯定没吃羊肉串 这太疯狂了
I definitely didn't have the lamb kebabs , that's crazy .

118
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,369
我讨厌羊肉 从来不点那个
I hate lamb , would never order that .

119
00:11:38,792 --> 00:11:39,781
不 不
No , no

120
00:13:26,542 --> 00:13:27,952
是的
Yes .

121
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:36,449
APE 我是艾米
APE , this is Amy .

122
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,619
那么什么是包装交易呢
So what is a packaging deal ?

123
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,456
包装交易是当一个电视节目或电影
Packaging deals are large payments

124
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:43,040
因我们在这个项目背后安排的创意团队而获得绿灯时
that we get when a TV show or movie is greenlit

125
00:13:43,167 --> 00:13:45,874
我们获得的大笔报酬
for us having arranged the creative team behind a project .

126
00:13:46,042 --> 00:13:48,328
这是一份附属的合同 通常是私人合同
It is an ancillary , often private contract ,

127
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,289
让我们能够行使我们的权力
that allows us to wield our power

128
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,366
以远高于我们
to enter deals for wav more than the 10%

129
00:13:52,542 --> 00:13:53,782
从客户群中赚取的10％的价格达成交易
we're making from our client pool .

130
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:56,078
这里面不存在所谓的问题
There's no such thing as problems , okay ?

131
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:57,994
只有机会
only opportunities .

132
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,990
现在WGA的那些混蛋们
Now , the cocksuckers at the WGA

133
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,786
试图告诉所有人包装的事
trying to tell everybody about packaging

134
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,991
让他们的成员离开我们的代理机构
and getting their members to leave our agency

135
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:06,366
这是我们有史以来面临的最大机会
is the biggest opportunity we've ever faced .

136
00:14:06,542 --> 00:14:08,248
这将意味着我们增长的终结
It would mean the end of growth for us .

137
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:13,699
这意味着这栋建筑
Now , what that means is that this building here ,

138
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:17,200
我们现在所处的这个结构...
this structure that we're in right now , um...

139
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,241
它不会...

你是一个濒临灭绝的社会网络
You are a dying social network ,

281
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:57,655
每个人都迫不及待地想看你崩溃

282
00:22:03,292 --> 00:22:04,953

如果他和CAA签约 这并不是世界上最糟糕的事情
And if he signs with CAA , it's not the worst thing in the world .

297

他仍然可以成为一个备选客户

昨天我们在我的办公室
So we were in my office yesterday

412
00:31:55,167 --> 00:31:56,657
我好像听到你说什么了
and I thought I heard you say something

413
00:31:56,667 --> 00:31:58,373
我只是想确认你说过
and I just want to make sure that you had said it .

414
00:31:58,375 --> 00:31:59,615
没什么大不了的 你又没惹什么麻烦
It's not a big deal . You're not in trouble or anything .

415
00:31:59,625 --> 00:32:01,411
- 嘿 麦琪 - 嗨 乔丹
- Hey , Maggie - Hi , Jordan .

416
00:32:01,542 --> 00:32:02,952
但我说我会介绍你和贝莱德的人联系
But I said that I would connect you with the people at Black Rock

417
00:32:02,958 --> 00:32:04,573
然后你说了一些关于
and then you said something about waking up on

418
00:32:04,583 --> 00:32:06,289
在床的右边醒来的事情
the right side of the bed .

419
00:32:06,417 --> 00:32:08,373
你还记得你到底说了什么吗
Do you remember what you actually said ?

420
00:32:09,417 --> 00:32:12,454
我不太明白
I'm not sure I understand .

421
00:32:12,583 --> 00:32:13,868
- 好吧 - 如果真的造成困扰的话
- okay - If it's a big deal ,

422
00:32:14,042 --> 00:32:15,532
其实也没那么重要
it's really not that important .

423
00:32:15,625 --> 00:32:18,867
我已经让我的男朋友帮我写简历了
I had my boyfriend work on my resume with me .

424
00:32:19,042 --> 00:32:21,033
如果我说了不该说的话 我很抱歉
I'm sorry if I said something I shouldn't have .

425
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:23,161
- 嗯 - 我越界了吗
- Uh-huh - Was I out of line ?

426
00:32:23,292 --> 00:32:25,704
- 我很抱歉 如果我有的话 - 我相信你没有
I'm so sorry if I was - I'm sure you weren't

427
00:32:25,833 --> 00:32:27,289
你没说其他的吗
And you didn't say anything ?

428
00:32:29,792 --> 00:32:32,704
天啊 你以为我说了什么
oh , my God . What do you think I said ?

429
00:32:36,875 --> 00:32:39,787
好吧 这很好 所以这是一次失败好吗
Okay , so this is great . So this is a failure , okay ?

430
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:41,782
所以我现在不能用我想对你们说的语言
So I can't use the language that I'd like to use to you right now

431
00:32:41,792 --> 00:32:43,453
因为该机构
because of the new direction

和国家正朝着新的方向发展 所以我不会

433
00:32:45,708 --> 00:32:47,323
我只能说这不管用
andI'll Just say that this isn't working .

434
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:49,745
好吗 这一切都不是 你不是在为我工作

今天就到此为止好吗
Let's call today a wash , okay ?

437

你明天来的时候是什么样子呢

438
00:32:53,958 --> 00:32:56,119
因为有一排刚毕业的大学生

So tell me , how are you gonna look tomorrow when you come in ?

442
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:04,831
你今天要怎么说服我
How are you gonna convince me today

443
00:33:04,958 --> 00:33:07,574

00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:32,699
关于我的私生活
You don't know the first fucking thing

452
00:33:32,833 --> 00:33:33,993

How are you ? I'm wondering if I can get

460
00:34:41,417 --> 00:34:43,499
一张打印出来的住宿收据
a receipt printed out for my stay .

461
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:45,035
几周前我住在这里
I stayed here a few weeks ago

462
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:47,749
我的助手在清理我的车
and my assistant was cleaning out a car that I own

463
00:34:47,875 --> 00:34:49,957
一定是像个白痴一样把它扔了
and must've thrown it away like a fucking idiot .

464
00:34:50,083 --> 00:34:52,574
哦 这种事时有发生 你有身份证明的复印件吗
oh , well that happens . Do you have a copy of your ID ?

465
00:34:52,708 --> 00:34:54,790
我有 但并不是我订的房间
I do , but I didn't make the reservation .

466
00:34:54,917 --> 00:34:56,077
我在一家大公司工作我不知道
I work for a big company and I'm not sure who's name

467
00:34:56,083 --> 00:34:57,619
- 用谁的名字订的 - 我明白了
- it would have been under - I See .

468
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:59,331
这么说你不知道订房间人的名字是吗
So you don't know the name the reservation was made under ?

469
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:02,120
我不知道 但应该是3月4日
I don't , but it would've been the 4th of March

470
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:04,332
下午1点10分左右 在320房间

or I'm uncertain , it could have been anytime .

472
00:35:06,333 --> 00:35:08,540
好吧
Okay .

473
00:35:08,625 --> 00:35:10,661
不幸的是 它不让我搜索这个
Well , unfortunately it won't let me search for that .

474
00:35:10,792 --> 00:35:12,532
有没有什么办法可以知道预订人名字或卡号
is there a way you can get the name or card number

475
00:35:12,542 --> 00:35:15,739
预订人名字吗
of the person who made the reservation ?

476
00:35:15,875 --> 00:35:17,911
好吧 我已经说过了
Okay , so I already said that there isn't .

477
00:35:18,042 --> 00:35:19,327
我在一家大型人才经纪公司工作
I work for a big talent agency

478
00:35:19,458 --> 00:35:22,040
我可不是小人物 是大人物
and I'm not a small fry over there , the big one .

479
00:35:22,125 --> 00:35:23,786
就几个字母 我让你猜三次
A couple letters , I'll give you three guesses .

480
00:35:23,792 --> 00:35:25,498
你只需要猜中一次 我就要结婚了
You're only gonna need one . I'm getting married soon ,

481
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,162
我不知道是谁造成了...
and I don't know who would have made the reser...

482
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:29,782
你从事电影行业吗
Are you in the film industry ?

483
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:33,116
我不从事
I'm not .

484
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:34,365
现在如果你可以打电话给别人
Now if you can call someone ,

485
00:35:34,458 --> 00:35:35,868
我们可以马上给你
we can get that to you immediately ,

486
00:35:35,875 --> 00:35:38,491
但这是酒店的隐私政策 我很抱歉
but it's hotel privacy policy , I'm so sorry .

487
00:35:38,625 --> 00:35:40,365
- 如果我被抢劫了怎么办 - 抱歉 如果什么
- What if I was robbed？- I'm sorry , if what ?

488
00:35:40,375 --> 00:35:42,286
假设我只在房间里待了17分钟
Let's say I was only in the room for 17 minutes

489
00:35:42,292 --> 00:35:43,873
有人从我的保险箱里偷了东西
and somebody stole something from my safe ,

490
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:45,285
如果我还认为你们两个以及酒店
and what if I also thought that you two at the hotel

491
00:35:45,292 --> 00:35:46,907
和这件事有关呢
had something to do with it ?

492
00:35:47,042 --> 00:35:49,704
实际上我不知道这种事的规章制度
I actually don't know the protocol for something like that .

493
00:35:49,833 --> 00:35:51,994
但我觉得我们会报警
I think we'd have to call the police .

494
00:35:52,125 --> 00:35:54,036
如果我是警察呢
And what if I am the police ?

495
00:35:55,125 --> 00:35:58,322
先生 如果你是警察
Sir , if you were the police ,

496
00:35:58,458 --> 00:36:00,164
你可能会提前打电话
you would've probably called ahead of time

497
00:36:00,167 --> 00:36:02,624
而且在我询要的时候你也会给我看你的身份证明
and you also would've shown me your ID when I asked for it

498
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:05,366
这样你就不会花45分钟
and maybe you wouldn't have spent 45 minutes

499
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,912
告诉我你是个多么出色的好莱坞经纪人

我也需要那些贪婪的人
And I need people that are ravenous too .

508

我需要饥饿的人们
I need people that are hungry .

509
00:36:40,958 --> 00:36:42,289
我去吃意式料理的时候

510
00:36:42,417 --> 00:36:45,079
我要了一个超级大份意大利宽面 那个服务员
I order a Fettuccine Supreme and that server ,

Uh , sorry , keep going . I just don't have time for it today .

516
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:57,915
我不知道会是这样
I didn't know that that was gonna be what this was about .

517
00:36:58,042 --> 00:37:00,328
我最初想来这里谈的是...
What I initially wanted to come in here to talkto about...

518
00:37:00,417 --> 00:37:02,282
没关系 没关系 我们过于强大 不容失败
It's fine . It's fine , we're too strong to fail ,

519
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:03,831
大家都做得很好

520
00:37:03,958 --> 00:37:07,030
我想和PJ谈谈 看看你有没有那东西

521
00:37:07,167 --> 00:37:09,283
那个...你还记得吗 别说了

529
00:37:29,042 --> 00:37:32,034
我想也许现在是我们都休息一下的好时机
I think maybe now is a good time we all take a break

530
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:36,285
重新评估我们到底在做什么

545

546

You worry too much .

00:38:42,208 --> 00:38:44,699
大多数人不会对他们的工作如此激动
Most people don't get so worked up about their job .

551
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:49,162
一切都会好起来的

558
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,865
我在车里杀了雷蒙德

559
00:40:27,042 --> 00:40:29,784

临阵退缩了吗
Cold feet ?

564
00:40:45,167 --> 00:40:46,156
我们来这里干什么
What are we doing here ?

565
00:40:50,708 --> 00:40:52,323
几周前
A couple of weeks ago ,

566
00:40:52,458 --> 00:40:54,414
我收到一封信
I got a letter in the mail

567
00:40:54,542 --> 00:40:57,375
邀请我在酒店房间里
inviting me to a no strings attached

568
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,617
进行无附加条件的性接触
Sexual encounter in a hotel room .

569
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,957
这是一张漂亮的邀请卡看起来很正式
It was a pretty card , looked official .

570
00:41:03,083 --> 00:41:06,621
我不知道我太蠢了 我去了
I don't know , I was stupid , I went .

571
00:41:06,792 --> 00:41:09,534
去你的 什么 伙计 这太疯狂了
oh , fuck you . What ? Dude , this is nuts .

572
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:11,532
我不得不戴上眼罩...
I had to wear a blindfold .

573
00:41:11,625 --> 00:41:14,583
我应该留着的 但那个女人...
I should've kept it , but the woman...

574
00:41:14,708 --> 00:41:16,539
我甚至不能告诉你
I can't even tell you .

575
00:41:16,625 --> 00:41:18,911
你知道在多元宇宙系统中
You know that thing where something's different

576
00:41:19,042 --> 00:41:21,158
宇宙内部的某些东西是不同的
inside of the universe in the multi-verse system

577
00:41:21,292 --> 00:41:22,873
而这是唯一不同的地方
and this is the one thing that's different .

578
00:41:22,875 --> 00:41:24,411
感觉就像这样 我不知道 很难解释
It felt like that . I don't know , it's hard to explain .

579
00:41:24,417 --> 00:41:25,827
等等 等等
Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , wait .

580
00:41:25,833 --> 00:41:27,369
这是怎么回事 等等
What's going on here？Hold on .

581
00:41:27,542 --> 00:41:29,032
等等 这真的发生了 你真的这么做了
Wait , this is really happening , you really did this ?

582
00:41:29,042 --> 00:41:30,657
在这种形势下
In this climate ?

583
00:41:32,083 --> 00:41:34,495
伙计 你他妈的想自杀吗
Dude , are you fucking suicidal ?

584
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:36,161
我不知道
I don't know .

585
00:41:36,292 --> 00:41:39,284
好吧 好吧 哇 我靠
okay , okay , wow , holy shit .

586
00:41:39,375 --> 00:41:40,581
- 是啊 - 好吧
oh , yeah - Okay .

587
00:41:40,708 --> 00:41:41,914
- 是啊 - 抱歉 好吧
- Yeah - Sorry , okay .

588
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:43,578
- 是啊 - 哇
- Yeah - Um , wow ,

589
00:41:43,708 --> 00:41:45,664
我以为你是在生我签下雷蒙德的气
I thought this was you being mad at me for signing Raymond .

590
00:41:45,667 --> 00:41:46,873
- 这是一个巨大的... - 你签下了雷蒙德了吗
- This is a huge．- You signed Raymond ?

591
00:41:46,875 --> 00:41:48,206
你他妈的怎么签下雷蒙德的
How the fuck did you sign Raymond ?

592
00:41:48,208 --> 00:41:50,119
好吧 等等 我们先不说那个
okay , well , hold on , let's...let's focus .

593
00:41:50,292 --> 00:41:52,533
让我们把注意力集中在这件事上好吗
So , let's focus here , okay ?

594
00:41:52,667 --> 00:41:55,124
好吧 我知道你是认真的
So , okay , so I know you're serious .

595
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:57,866
好吧 我们开始吧 首先 我很抱歉
okay , so let's do this . so first of all , I'm so sorry .

596
00:41:58,042 --> 00:42:00,033
你来找我显然是没有其他选择
You clearly have no other options , you came to me .

597
00:42:00,167 --> 00:42:03,000
没有回信地址 没有邮票
So there's no return address , no stamp ,

598
00:42:03,125 --> 00:42:06,322
所以可能是亲自送来的 或者是快递送来的
So probably delivered personally or by a courier maybe .

599
00:42:06,458 --> 00:42:07,823
你们大楼里有安全摄像头吗
Do you have security cameras at your building ?

600
00:42:07,833 --> 00:42:09,073
你可能已经想过这些了
You probably already thought about all this .

601
00:42:09,083 --> 00:42:10,619
- 是的 - 在过去几个月里
- Yeah - Has anyone reached out to you

602
00:42:10,792 --> 00:42:11,827
是否有人在社交媒体上联系过你
on social media in the past couple months ?

603
00:42:11,833 --> 00:42:13,414
这可能看起来很奇怪
It might seem strange .

604
00:42:13,542 --> 00:42:15,624
也许有人想破坏婚礼
Maybe someone trying to sabotage the wedding

605
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:17,081
或者像是最后的狂欢之类的
or like a last hurrah kind of thing .

606
00:42:17,083 --> 00:42:19,665
我想不起来...
I can't think of...

607
00:42:19,792 --> 00:42:21,532
没有
NO

608
00:42:21,667 --> 00:42:24,955
所以你看不到她 她戴着眼罩吗
So you couldn't see her ? Was she wearing a mask？

609
00:42:25,083 --> 00:42:26,698
我想是的
I think so .

610
00:42:26,833 --> 00:42:29,165
她在房间里的动作很敏捷
She was quick in the room .

611
00:42:29,292 --> 00:42:31,328
她一开始绝对是戴着的
She definitely had it on at the beginning .

612
00:42:31,458 --> 00:42:33,665
她一定也对家具了如指掌
She must've known her way around the furniture .

613
00:42:33,792 --> 00:42:36,989
但后来我把它取下来了
But then I took it off .

614
00:42:37,125 --> 00:42:39,207
我想她看到我的脸了 我想她认出我了
I think she saw my face . I think she'd recognized me .

615
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:42,706
你一个人在房间里吗
And you were alone in the room ?

616
00:42:42,833 --> 00:42:45,370
哦 该死 现在我不知道了
oh , fuck . Yeah , now I don't know .

617
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,206
看 这就是我他妈一开始
See , that's the reason I wanted

618
00:42:47,333 --> 00:42:49,164
想谈这件事的原因
to fucking talk about this in the first place .

619
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:52,957
你为什么不把眼罩摘下来呢
Why didn't you Just take the fucking mask off ?

620
00:42:53,083 --> 00:42:54,414
我不想让她知道是我
I didn't want her to know it was me .

621
00:42:54,417 --> 00:42:56,533
我不知道 推诿 自我保护...
I don't know , deniability , self-protec...

622
00:42:56,667 --> 00:42:58,282
我不知道 我觉得我被吓坏了
I don't know , I think I was fucking terrified .

623
00:42:58,292 --> 00:42:59,452
- 谢谢 - 给你
- oh , thank you - Here you go .

624
00:42:59,458 --> 00:43:01,119
- 慢用 - 非常感谢
一Enioy - Thank you so much .

625
00:43:03,042 --> 00:43:04,532
不知道那封信是从哪儿来的吗
No idea where that letter came from ?

626
00:43:04,667 --> 00:43:06,578
我很抱歉告诉了你这些
I'm sorry I told you all of this .

627
00:43:06,708 --> 00:43:08,244
不 伙计 完全没事
No，dude , totally fine .

628
00:43:08,375 --> 00:43:09,911
现在我怀疑每个人
Now I'm suspicious of everyone .

629
00:43:10,875 --> 00:43:11,990
也许是你老婆
Maybe it's your wife .

630
00:43:13,708 --> 00:43:15,824
也许是我老婆
Maybe it's my wife .

631
00:43:15,958 --> 00:43:18,324
伙计 这可能是任何人 也有可能是以前的客户
Dude , this could be anybody . This could be an ex-client .

632

不对 是CAA 一定是的
Nope , this is CAA . Yep .

633
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:25,077
你知道 我想过这个
You know , I was thinking about this .

634
00:43:25,208 --> 00:43:27,073
我考虑过做这样的事情
I was thinking about doing something like this

635
00:43:27,208 --> 00:43:28,573
作为一种生意
as a businesg .

636
00:43:28,708 --> 00:43:30,039
但我不再能这样了
Can't do this shit anymore .

637
00:43:30,167 --> 00:43:31,782
背着我的妻子吗
With my wife ?

638
00:43:31,917 --> 00:43:33,703
她全家都是律师
Her whole family's lawyers .

639
00:43:33,833 --> 00:43:35,573
她会把我的头砍下来
She would cut my fucking head off .

640
00:43:36,708 --> 00:43:38,244
然后逍遥法外
She'd get away with it .

641
00:43:41,292 --> 00:43:43,658
伙计 如果我有收到这种东西
Dude , if I got one of these fucking things ,

642
00:43:43,792 --> 00:43:46,078
我会睡在收发室里

643
00:43:50,417 --> 00:43:52,453

728
00:47:23,042 --> 00:47:25,784
但我想知道路易丝·拉弗蒂在家吗

他弄丢了他的狗

741
00:47:47,417 --> 00:47:50,159
他在附近发传单
and he's handing out flyers in the neighborhood .

742

759
00:49:03,042 --> 00:49:05,454
它们是由位于伯班克的爱马仕邮政公司生产的
They're made from this company called Hermes Post in Burbank .

760
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:07,373
他们是一家在线公司他们生产很多这样的东西
They're this online company . They make a bunch of those

761
00:49:07,375 --> 00:49:08,660
像是公司派对邀请函什么的
corporate party invites and shit .

762
00:49:08,792 --> 00:49:10,077
这正是我们所担心的
Which is what we were worried about .

763
00:49:10,083 --> 00:49:11,664
好莱坞的邮政信箱是匿名的
The P.0. box in Hollywood is anonymous .

764
00:49:11,792 --> 00:49:13,908
它是通过网站设置的，所以这又是一个死胡同
It's set up through the website so that's another dead end .

765
00:49:13,917 --> 00:49:15,578
- 好了 该死 - 等等 好了 停下
- All right , shit - Hold on , all right , stop .

766
00:49:15,583 --> 00:49:18,575

嘿 我们要的那两杯能快点吗 谢谢

Okay , I'm gonna talk and I'm gonna finish ,

769
00:49:26,917 --> 00:49:30,455
你想说什么就说什么
and then you can say whatever you're gonna say .

770
00:49:30,583 --> 00:49:32,744
但是请让我说完
But please Just let me get through this

771
00:49:32,875 --> 00:49:35,161
因为这很重要好吗

772
00:49:37,458 --> 00:49:38,447
好吧
Okay .

773
00:49:40,917 --> 00:49:43,033
好的
Okay .

774
00:49:43,125 --> 00:49:44,911
当社交媒体平台刚开始出现的时候
When social media platforms first began ,

775
00:49:45,042 --> 00:49:46,782
仅仅基于人与人之间的联系
they were based solely on connecting people ,

776
00:49:46,875 --> 00:49:48,160
但后来被扭曲了
but then they were bastardized

777
00:49:48,292 --> 00:49:49,953
变成了赚钱的机器
and turned into these money-making machines

778
00:49:49,958 --> 00:49:52,165
它们会收集你的数据 然后卖给广告商
that would harvest your data and sell it to advertisers .

779
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:54,206
比如说你在大学的时候点击过什么东西
So say you clicked on something back in college ,

780
00:49:54,333 --> 00:49:55,698
所有那些点击所有那些点赞
all those clicks , all those likes

781
00:49:55,833 --> 00:49:57,164
从那时起一直到现在的
from then all the way till now ,

782
00:49:57,292 --> 00:49:58,998
都被这些公司保存起来了
that's all been saved by these companies .

783
00:49:59,125 --> 00:50:00,615
然后在2013年
And then in 2013 ,

784
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:02,957
他们开始允许其他公司使用这些数据
they started allowing other companies to use that data

785
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:04,539
来锁定你作为消费者的
to target you as a consumer

786
00:50:04,667 --> 00:50:06,703
所有具体兴趣和行为
for all your specific interests and behaviors .

787
00:50:06,833 --> 00:50:08,994
你在推特上的每一个点赞都是公开的
Every like on Twitter you've ever had , that's all public .

788
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,581
你可以查看任何人的社交媒体账号
You can go on anyone's social media account

789
00:50:10,583 --> 00:50:12,289
看到他们从一开始就喜欢的一切
and see everything they've liked from the beginning .

790
00:50:12,292 --> 00:50:15,910
现在所有的数据都是可以被收集
Now , all of that data is scrapable .

791
00:50:16,042 --> 00:50:18,203
这意味着有人想出了一个程序
同eaning someone could come up with a program

792
00:50:18,333 --> 00:50:19,698
从你完整的在线数字足迹中
that would compile all of that data

793
00:50:19,708 --> 00:50:21,699
汇编所有这些数据
from your complete online digital footprint

794
00:50:21,833 --> 00:50:25,030
并利用它来更好地了解你 以及如何接近你
and use it to better understand you and how to get to you .

795
00:50:25,167 --> 00:50:27,874
如果我在做这件事 我会把目标对准有钱人
And if I were doing this , I'd go after the wealthy .

796
00:50:28,042 --> 00:50:29,623
比如说你在社交媒体上
So say you're on social media

797
00:50:29,792 --> 00:50:33,410
你关注福布斯兰博基尼
and you follow Forbes and Lamborghini

798
00:50:33,542 --> 00:50:36,124
还有游艇俱乐部和好莱坞经纪公司
and Yacht Clubs and Hollywood agencies , yeah .

799
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:39,868
最重要的是假设你还订婚了
And on top of that , let's say you're also engaged

800
00:50:40,042 --> 00:50:41,373
而且在过去的三个月里
and that for the past three months ,

801
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:42,615
你也断断续续的
you've also been off and on

802
00:50:42,792 --> 00:50:43,952
点赞半裸女性的照片
Iiking pictures of half naked women .

803
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:45,619
- 我操 - 让我说完
- Fuck me - Let me finish .

804
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:48,327
半裸女性
Half naked women .

805
00:50:48,458 --> 00:50:49,493
那就意味着 第一
That would mean one

806
00:50:49,625 --> 00:50:50,831
你可能赚了很多钱
you probably make a lot of money ,

807

这是最终的点击诱饵 渴望陷阱
It's the ultimate click bait , thirst trap .

事实上 别查

别担心 没关系的
Don't worry about it , doesn't matter .

828

他们甚至都不谈论这个

829

因为必有后果

00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:18,156
你觉得怎么样
What do you think ?

946
00:57:18,292 --> 00:57:20,078
我可以让本在Zillow房地产网站看看
I can get Ben to look on Zillow

947
00:57:20,208 --> 00:57:24,076
看看我们能不能在罗马买个房子
to see if we can buy a place in Rome ?

948
00:57:25,625 --> 00:57:26,910
你说呢
What do you think ?

949
00:57:28,958 --> 00:57:30,038
听起来像是个梦
Sounds like a dream .

950
00:57:33,167 --> 00:57:34,156
一个好梦 不是吗
A good dream ?

951
00:58:02,917 --> 00:58:05,329
救命
Help .

952
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:08,869
救命
Help .

953
00:58:29,875 --> 00:58:31,786
好了 伙计们 接下来是有趣的部分
Okay , guys , now this is the fun part .

954
00:58:31,917 --> 00:58:33,782
- 我们要用虾 - 你没事吧
- We're gonna take the shrimp..．- You all right ?

955
00:58:33,792 --> 00:58:36,033
没事 这很令人兴奋 我很喜欢
Yeah , it's exciting , I love it .

956
00:58:36,167 --> 00:58:37,782
热量会使它更容易被包裹起来
The heat's gonna make it easier to wrap .

957
00:58:37,917 --> 00:58:39,327
但我们得确保我们不会烧伤自己
Let's make sure we don't burn ourselves .

958
00:58:39,333 --> 00:58:41,198
- 你确定吗 - 是的 我只是有点热 亲爱的
- You sure？- Yeah , I'm Just hot , honey ,

959
00:58:41,208 --> 00:58:43,574
我就在炉子旁边 还穿着这件愚蠢的衣服
I'm right next to the stove andI'm wearing this stupid fucking outfit .

960
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:45,119
- 感觉怎么样 卡罗琳 - 还行吧
- How are we doing over here , Caroline？- Fine I think .

961
00:58:45,125 --> 00:58:46,615
好吧 我们忘了胡萝卜片
Okay , well we forgot the carrot slices

962
00:58:46,708 --> 00:58:48,289
不过没关系 我们可以随时煮...
but that's okay , we can always boil...

963
00:58:48,375 --> 00:58:49,831
不实际上我们不想把胡萝卜片和我们的放在一起
No，actually we don't want carrot slices with ours .

964
00:58:49,833 --> 00:58:51,539
- 非常感谢 - 不 要做就要做对
- Thank you so much - Nope , let's do it right ,

965
00:58:51,542 --> 00:58:53,032
至少第一次得这样好吗
at least the first time , okay ?

966
00:58:53,167 --> 00:58:55,499
卡罗琳你去拿点胡萝卜吧
So Caroline , you want to grab those carrots ?

967
00:58:55,625 --> 00:58:57,866
不 别帮忙 停下 我...我们不需要...
No，don't help , stop . I...We don't need any...

968
00:58:58,042 --> 00:59:00,579
好吧 对不起 我只是有点热 我就在...
Okay , I'm sorry , I'm just hot , I'm right next to...

969
00:59:00,708 --> 00:59:02,289
我能把这个拿下来吗 可以吗
Can I take this off ? is that all right ?

970
00:59:02,417 --> 00:59:03,827
穿着这身衣服我觉得自己要窒息了
I feel like I'm suffocating in this fucking outfit .

971
00:59:03,833 --> 00:59:05,573
伙计 只是...只是做饭 伙计 我们在做饭
Dude , Just...Just cook , dude , we're cooking .

972
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:07,289
- 是的 谢谢 PJ 我正在做饭 - 好的 酷不用担心
- Yeah , thanks , PJ , I am cooking - okay , cool , no worries .

973
00:59:07,292 --> 00:59:08,657
你需要出去呼吸一下新鲜空气吗
Do you need to mavbe go outside and get some fresh air ?

974
00:59:08,667 --> 00:59:10,077
不用 我不需要出去
No , I don't need to go outside .

975
00:59:10,208 --> 00:59:12,790
我是来做饭的 让我们做饭吧 去他妈的 对吧
I came here to cook , let's cook . Fuck it , right ?

976
00:59:15,083 --> 00:59:17,074
现在我意识到我提高了嗓门
And now I realize I've raised my voice .

977
00:59:18,792 --> 00:59:20,623
现在我觉得我他妈的疯了
And now I feel like I'm losing my fucking mind

978
00:59:20,708 --> 00:59:22,323
因为没人想承认这一点
'cause nobody's acknowledging it .

979
00:59:22,458 --> 00:59:24,449
兄弟 嘿 嘿 我觉得出去呼吸点新鲜空气
Buddy , hey , hey , I think maybe it's a great idea

980
00:59:24,583 --> 00:59:25,914
是个好主意
for you to just go outside and get some fresh air

981
00:59:25,917 --> 00:59:27,282
另外再想想看
and just think about the fact that

982
00:59:27,417 --> 00:59:29,408
我们不得不假装这是我们的主意 好让你的未婚妻
we had to pretend this was our idea so your fiance

983
00:59:29,542 --> 00:59:32,204
可以和你共度他妈的美好时光
could spend some quality fucking time with you so ,

984
00:59:32,333 --> 00:59:35,530
春卷 我们在做春卷
spring rolls , we're making spring rolls .

985
00:59:35,667 --> 00:59:38,625
一旦它们被卷起来 我们就可以把它们叠在一起
once they're rolled , we can stack them beside each other

986
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:41,412
排成一排排的
into nice little rows .

987
00:59:41,542 --> 00:59:43,282
如果它看起来很奇怪 也没有关系
It doesn't matter if it looks weird ,

988
00:59:43,417 --> 00:59:45,578
味道应该会很不错
it'll taste good , probably .

989
00:59:49,083 --> 00:59:51,495
- 对不起 - 我没事
- I'm sorry - I'm fine .

990
00:59:51,625 --> 00:59:53,286
-不 不好意思 - 我没事
-No，I'm sorry - Uh-uh , I'm fine .

991
00:59:53,417 --> 00:59:55,078
我不是故意的 我不知道自己怎么了
I didn't mean to do that . I don't know what's wrong with me .

992
00:59:55,083 --> 00:59:56,869
我们停下 离开这里
Let's stop , let's get out of here .

993
00:59:57,042 --> 00:59:59,033
我们走吧 我不想变成这样
Let's go away , I don't want to be like this .

994
00:59:59,167 --> 01:00:01,078
我能看到自己在做什么我不想变成这样
I can see myself and I don't want to be like this .

995
01:00:01,083 --> 01:00:02,163
我不知道我怎么了
I don't know what's wrong with me .

996
01:00:02,167 --> 01:00:03,282
好吧 我懂了 我懂了
Okay , I get it , I get it .

997
01:00:04,875 --> 01:00:06,581
假装做你自己
It must be absolutely exhausting

998
01:00:06,708 --> 01:00:07,914
一定很筋疲力尽
pretending to be you .

999
01:00:25,042 --> 01:00:26,498
嘿 我是乔丹·海因斯
Hey , you've reached JordanHines .

1000
01:00:26,625 --> 01:00:28,832
我将在山区不与人联系
I'm gonna be out of contact in the mountains

1001
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:31,574
要为我们的婚礼做一些场地考察
doing some venue scouting for our wedding ,

1002
01:00:31,708 --> 01:00:33,664
但我同时也有空
but I'm also available .

1003
01:00:33,792 --> 01:00:36,204
好的 好的 再见 保重
okay , yeah , great , bye now , take care .

1004
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:48,617
我现在一直都有这种恐惧
I have this fear all the time now

1005
01:00:48,792 --> 01:00:52,080
我周围有一大群人
that there's this crowd of people around me

1006
01:00:52,208 --> 01:00:54,199
对我评头论足
judging me

1007
01:00:54,333 --> 01:00:55,948
就等着我犯错...
just waiting for me to slip up...

1008
01:00:58,458 --> 01:01:01,575
这样他们就可以给我涂上焦油和羽毛...
So they can tar and feather me...

1009
01:01:01,708 --> 01:01:03,198
或者把我赶出公司
Or drive me out of town .

1010
01:01:05,542 --> 01:01:09,114
我想我到最后都会一直
And I think I end up thinking about these people

1011
01:01:09,250 --> 01:01:11,616
想着这些人...
so much...

1012
01:01:11,792 --> 01:01:16,240
我有时候会忘记自己真正的想法...
that I sometimes forget what I really think...

1013
01:01:19,167 --> 01:01:22,079
以及我对某些事的真实感受
how I really feel about something .

1014
01:01:24,292 --> 01:01:26,533
当你和别人友好相处的时候 我会看着你
I watch you when you're friendly with people

1015
01:01:26,667 --> 01:01:30,489
我不知道你是像
and I don't know if you've made friends

1016
01:01:30,625 --> 01:01:34,368
普通人那样在交朋友
the way that normal people make friends

1017
01:01:34,542 --> 01:01:36,533
还是你只是为了工作
or if you're just doing it for the job

1018
01:01:36,667 --> 01:01:39,124
我想你也分辨不出来
and I don't think you can tell the difference either .

1019
01:01:39,292 --> 01:01:40,498
好吧 这是什么
okay , what is this ?

1020
01:01:40,625 --> 01:01:41,865
这是关于乔丹的周末吗
Is this a fuck Jordan weekend ,

1021
01:01:41,875 --> 01:01:44,617
带我来山上就为了侮辱我吗
take me to the mountains and insult me ?

1022
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:47,412
亲爱的 我不是在侮辱你
Honey , I'm not insulting you .

1023
01:01:47,542 --> 01:01:48,907
我是在描述你
I'm describing you .

1024
01:01:51,667 --> 01:01:53,953
- 你能不能别说了 - 什么
- Would you just stop？ - What ?

1025
01:01:54,083 --> 01:01:55,448
这样我就可以...你看着我
So I can...So you can look at me

1026
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:57,323
- 当我在和你... - 我在看着你
- like look at me when I'm...  - I'm looking at you .

1027
01:01:57,333 --> 01:01:58,789
你在说什么 我看着你呢
What are you talking about ? I am looking at you .

1028
01:01:58,792 --> 01:02:00,874
你没有对我说实话
You're not being honest with me .

1029
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,082
你甚至不能说实话
You can't even be honest about being fucking honest .

1030
01:02:03,208 --> 01:02:05,039
- 不是这样的 - 你要去哪
- That's not true - Where are you going ?

1031
01:02:05,167 --> 01:02:07,158
我哪儿也不去
I'm not going anywhere .

1032
01:02:07,292 --> 01:02:08,532
我以为这就是那条小路
I thought this was the trail .

1033
01:02:08,625 --> 01:02:10,035
是你把我逼下来的
You pushed me off the fucking trail .

1034
01:02:10,167 --> 01:02:11,373
我没有逼你
I'm not pushing you .

1035
01:02:11,542 --> 01:02:13,248
我们在他妈的树林里
We're in the middle of the fucking woods .

1036
01:02:13,375 --> 01:02:15,912
- 跟我说话 - 我在跟你说话
- Talk to me! - I'm talking to you .

1037
01:02:16,042 --> 01:02:18,454
- 但是对我说实话 - 我对你说实话
- But be honest with me - I am honest with you .

1038
01:02:18,583 --> 01:02:20,949
这不是你的假关系之一
This is not one of your "fake" relationships .

1039
01:02:21,083 --> 01:02:24,530
我是你的未婚妻 他妈的和我谈谈吧
am your fiance , fucking engage with me .

1040
01:02:27,917 --> 01:02:30,033
- 我爱你 - 我也爱你
- I love you - Yeah , I love you .

1041
01:02:30,958 --> 01:02:33,745
好吧

- 你来吗 - 当然
- Are you coming？ - Yeah , I'm coming .

1043
01:05:28,667 --> 01:05:30,532
不 亲爱的 我觉得他会做得很好
No , honey , I think he's gonna do a great job .

1044
01:05:30,625 --> 01:05:32,286
我只是想知道你是否还能找到
I'm just wondering if you could've picked

1045
01:05:32,292 --> 01:05:34,157
一个比他更老套的婚礼策划人
a bigger cliche of a wedding planner .

1046
01:05:34,292 --> 01:05:37,125
哦 你要嘲笑
oh , you're gonna make fun of someone

1047
01:05:37,250 --> 01:05:39,582
一个假装对工作充满热情的人吗
for faking enthusiasm for their job ?

1048
01:05:48,458 --> 01:05:52,576
嗯 我能要...我不知道 还是卡布奇诺吧
Um , can I do a...I don't know , cappuccino .

1049
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:55,789
加蜂蜜 你们有蜂蜜吗
With honey . Do you have honey ?

1050
01:05:55,917 --> 01:05:59,535
这家伙想要一杯大杯美式咖啡
And this fella wants a large Americano

1051
01:05:59,625 --> 01:06:01,206
再加一杯
with an extra Shot .

1052
01:06:01,333 --> 01:06:03,699
一杯薰衣草拿铁 我想就这样了
A latte with lavender , I think it was .

1053
01:06:03,833 --> 01:06:06,040
你们有什么特别推荐吗
Do you have a special ?

1054
01:06:09,083 --> 01:06:10,323

- 你可以继续假装 - 好的

座位卡安排的电子邮件

1345

你也是这么想的

1346
01:24:37,208 --> 01:24:39,039
我他妈看得出来
I can fucking tell ,

1347
01:24:39,167 --> 01:24:40,532
因为内心深处
because deep down

1348
01:24:40,625 --> 01:24:45,289
我是一个他妈根本不在乎的人
I'm somebody who just cannot give a shit .

1349
01:24:55,083 --> 01:24:56,198
特斯拉不是我的

1350
01:24:56,333 --> 01:24:57,948
我一直在租用它

我认为这个世界将会变成

一个可怕的地方

1353

我想我只是看着它变成那样

这是一个我永远无法控制的地方

你爱上我是因为我很强大
You fell in love with me 'cause I was powerful .

1356

1362
01:25:28,333 --> 01:25:30,039
如果我不是你想象中六天后要嫁的那个男人
if I'm not the man you thought you were marrying in six days

1363
01:25:30,042 --> 01:25:31,578
我很抱歉
and I'm sorry about that .

1364
01:25:37,542 --> 01:25:39,498
我只是不想再感到羞耻了

1365

你认为我们今天能走多远

1373

1374

事情是这样的

所有这些事情 都不是什么新鲜事

虽然不同 但它并不新鲜

这可能是一次谈话

1378

你知道 有人躲在黑暗中

1380

破坏我们所拥有的

1381

他们会对你微笑 他们会试图给你下套
