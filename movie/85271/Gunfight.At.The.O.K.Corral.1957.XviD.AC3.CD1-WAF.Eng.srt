2
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,890
OK... Corral

3
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:37,231
OK... Corral

4
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:41,638
There the outlaw band
made their final stand

5
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:46,908
OK... Corral

6
00:00:46,947 --> 00:00:51,509
Oh, my dearest, one must die,
lay down my gun

7
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:56,352
Or take the chance
of losing you forever

8
00:00:56,389 --> 00:01:00,553
Duty calls,
my back's against the wall

9
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:06,191
Have you no kind word to say
before I ride away?

10
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:14,404
Your love... your love

11
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:19,002
I need... your love

12
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,673
Keep the flame, let it burn

13
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:28,780
Until I return from
the gunfight at OK Corral

14
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:31,313
If the Lord is my friend

15
00:01:31,358 --> 00:01:38,890
We'll meet at the end
of the gunfight at OK Corral

16
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:43,665
Gunfight at OK Corral

17
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:48,174
OK... Corral

18
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:53,474
OK... Corral

19
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:55,310
There the outlaw band

20
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:57,942
Made their final stand

21
00:01:58,018 --> 00:02:03,115
OK... Corral

22
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:05,624
Oh, my dearest, one must die

23
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:07,320
Lay down my gun

24
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,954
And take the chance

25
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:12,726
Of losing you forever

26
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,096
Duty calls

27
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:16,601
My back's against the wall

28
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:23,803
Have you no kind word to say
before I ride away?

29
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:29,240
Away

30
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:31,250
Boot Hill

31
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:32,683
Boot Hill, Boot Hill,
Boot Hill

32
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,084
Boot Hill

33
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,246
In the air, there's a chill,
there's a chill

34
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:36,414
So cold

35
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:37,650
Mighty cold, mighty cold,
mighty cold

36
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:39,056
So still

37
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:40,389
Mighty still, mighty still,
mighty still

38
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:42,588
There they lay,
side by side,

39
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:50,331
The killers that died
in the gunfight at OK Corral

40
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:55,136
OK... Corral

41
00:02:55,175 --> 00:03:00,772
Gunfight at OK Corral.

42
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,486
Hello, Ed.

43
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:46,787
Where's Doc Holliday?

44
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:48,350
Over at the hotel,
more than likely.

45
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:49,657
He's been
expecting you...

46
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,493
Get word over there
I'm waiting for him.

47
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:52,532
No need to do that, Ed.

48
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:54,830
The whole town knows
you're waiting for him by now.

49
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,336
Before there's
another killing...

50
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,327
You just go on serving
your watered-down liquor

51
00:03:58,371 --> 00:03:59,895
and keep out
of my business, Shanssey.

52
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:01,701
Your brother came in here
stinking drunk,

53
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:02,639
spoiling for a fight.

54
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:03,664
Whiskey!

55
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,768
He drew a gun
on Holliday.

56
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:05,778
Over there!

57
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:11,912
Have it your way, Ed.

58
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:14,249
Check your guns,
if you want to stay here.

59
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:29,490
Leave the bottle!

60
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,801
You don't stand a chance, Doc.

61
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,207
Bailey brought two men with him.

62
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:39,541
Oh, come on, honey,

63
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,570
let's cut out of here
while there's still time.

64
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:44,139
The whole town, including
that no-good marshal,

65
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:45,242
is laying for you.

66
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:51,249
Right or wrong, they're going
to hang you for another killing.

67
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,280
You know it.

68
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,056
Doc.

69
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:57,188
Oh, you ain't even
listening to me.

70
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:02,458
Now, Kate, Mr. Bailey
came all the way from Fort Worth

71
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:04,526
to see me
on a gentleman's matter.

72
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:05,628
"Gentleman."

73
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:06,694
It wouldn't be hospitable

74
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:08,365
for me to leave town,
now, would it?

75
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:11,275
Don't start that gentleman
business with me again.

76
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,439
Well, it's a pure case
of ethics, but...

77
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,210
Well, that's something

78
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:18,012
a person like you
wouldn't understand.

79
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:22,678
Why do you always have
to treat me like I'm dirt?

80
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:24,713
You ain't no better than me!

81
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:25,815
That's debatable.

82
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:26,914
Oh, is it?

83
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:30,623
You and that magnolia drippin'.

84
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,722
Well, let me tell you
something, Doc Holliday.

85
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,824
All them fancy clothes and that smart talk

86
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:36,232
don't make you no gentleman!

87
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:39,738
You are dirt, just like me.

88
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:41,603
And I'm tired of hearing
about that...

89
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:42,801
Georgia plantation

90
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:45,344
and all them lily-white
friends of yours.

91
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:46,742
They're all gone now!

92
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:48,303
They're all gone!

93
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:54,309
Yes, they are...

94
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,322
and here I am with you.

95
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,586
Your family scraped the barrel
after the war wiped them out

96
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,024
just to send you through dental school.

97
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:03,886
You sure turned out fine.

98
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,797
They'd be real proud of you.

99
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:12,705
Ow!

100
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,567
Don't you ever mention
my family again.

101
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:21,235
Doc, please...

102
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:25,109
Doc, please.

103
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,044
Forget about Bailey.

104
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:31,989
Let's get out of here
while there's still time.

105
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:35,394
Maybe...

106
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:36,918
Maybe we could
even go to Laredo

107
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:37,987
like you... you said

108
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:39,828
and do something about
that cough of yours.

109
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,129
It's getting worse all the time.

110
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:45,000
Your concern over my health
touches me deeply.

111
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,198
You know how
I feel about you.

112
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,071
I know exactly how you feel.

113
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:54,240
I don't know...

114
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,838
I don't know what I'd do

115
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:57,076
if anything
happened to you.

116
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:59,380
You'd lose your meal ticket,
wouldn't you?

117
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:03,252
That ain't nice
to say to me, Doc.

118
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:05,883
I've been good
to you, ain't I?

119
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,450
Why don't you think
about me once in a while?

120
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,165
All right, get over
to Shanssey's

121
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:16,600
and tell him
I'll be there later.

122
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:18,034
Please, don't go there.

123
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:19,060
Do as I tell you.

124
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,212
I need some money.

125
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:32,835
Hello, Wyatt.

126
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,708
Cotton Wilson.

127
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,343
It's been a long time.

128
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,654
Man, I'm plain wore out.

129
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:47,689
Hope you got some
good news for me.

130
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:50,321
Ike Clanton rode through here
three days ago, heading east.

131
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,330
Waco, I think.

132
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:53,331
Johnny Ringo was with him.

133
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:54,457
Rode through, heading east?

134
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,660
You didn't get my telegram.

135
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:56,691
I got it.

136
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:01,198
Well, why didn't you
hold him?

137
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,105
I had no quarrel
with lke Clanton.

138
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:04,507
Nothing to hold him for.

139
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:08,713
Nothing to hold him for?

140
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:10,739
Why, man, he's got a dozen
charges against him.

141
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:13,274
I played this whole thing
so he'd be forced into Griffin.

142
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:15,879
I figured if there was one man
in Texas who could stop him,

143
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:17,355
you'd be the man.

144
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,120
Now, don't go getting your blood
heated up, Wyatt.

145
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:24,689
Cotton, it's Wyatt Earp
you're talking to.

146
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:27,164
Ten years ago, I watched
you walk single-handed

147
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,758
into a saloon
in Oklahoma City,

148
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:31,860
and knock out three of the
fastest guns in the territory.

149
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:34,736
Ten years
is a long time ago.

150
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,435
Getting old, I guess.

151
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:45,780
Anybody ever told me that
Cotton Wilson had gone yellow,

152
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:47,149
I would have called
them a liar.

153
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:48,983
You have no right
to say that to me, Wyatt.

154
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:51,455
I've bucked heads with the
toughest gangs on the frontier.

155
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:53,288
Then why didn't you
stop Ringo and Clanton?

156
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:54,657
Well, why didn't you?!

157
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,656
If you can't handle it anymore,
turn in your badge!

158
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:06,372
Turn in my badge.

159
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:09,541
I've been a lawman for 25 years.

160
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,043
Worked every hellhole
in the territory.

161
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:15,070
You know what I got
to show for it?

162
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,674
A $12-a-month room in the back
of a cruddy boardinghouse,

163
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:18,706
and a tin star.

164
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,819
Think I like winding up
in a place like this?

165
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:24,880
It's the end of the line
for me, Wyatt.

166
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,891
It'll happen to you someday.

167
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:28,689
Just like it happens
to all of us.

168
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:43,933
Where is that
yellow-livered skunk?

169
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,034
Slow down, Ed.

170
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:47,841
Holliday's only
trying to rile you.

171
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,212
What do you figure's
keeping Holliday?

172
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:52,183
Doc's going to make 'em
dangle a little.

173
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:57,155
Wyatt Earp.

174
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,157
Why, you old son of a gun.

175
00:10:58,191 --> 00:11:00,352
Why didn't you let us know
you was riding into town?

176
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:01,621
Good to see you, John.

177
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:02,923
Hi, Marshal.

178
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:04,190
Come on, sit down.

179
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:07,359
Cigar?

180
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:11,502
I'll be a son of a gun.

181
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:13,198
You've sure come a long ways

182
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:15,706
since the railroading
days in Cheyenne.

183
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:18,209
Ellsworth, Wichita,
now Dodge City.

184
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:20,177
Funny, I never figured
you for a lawman.

185
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:22,147
You was always
pretty reckless and wild.

186
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,046
Never figured myself
for a lawman, either.

187
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,380
Fix a nice steak
for Mr. Earp.

188
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:26,385
Yes, sir.

189
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,046
My personal stock.

190
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:29,281
How are the brothers?

191
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:31,017
Fine. Virgil and
Morgan are married.

192
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:32,149
Virgil and Morgan married?

193
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,055
What do you know.

194
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:35,492
John, I need some help.

195
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,893
Anything I can do for you.

196
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:38,396
Ike Clanton and Johnny Ringo

197
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:40,160
rode through here
three days ago.

198
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:41,791
They got a dozen counts
against them.

199
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:43,324
I telegraphed Cotton
to hold them,

200
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:44,334
but he crossed me up.

201
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:46,371
Cotton's skidded a long way.

202
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:47,565
You know anything?

203
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,335
Wish I did, but...

204
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:50,739
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

205
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:52,437
Doc Holliday played poker
with them.

206
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:53,638
Maybe he heard something.

207
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,941
Bartender!

208
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,277
Bartender!

209
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:59,477
Let's have some decent
whiskey around here!

210
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:02,783
Ed Bailey.

211
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:04,619
Doc Holliday
killed his brother.

212
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:05,817
The guy was begging for it.

213
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:07,483
He came in drunk,
cheated at cards.

214
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:08,824
He pulled a gun on Doc.

215
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:09,987
Did you ever
meet Holliday?

216
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:11,964
We crossed trails once.

217
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:13,192
He was a dentist then.

218
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,598
You know, I've yet
to see the guy pick a fight.

219
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:17,795
Trouble just naturally
seems to find him.

220
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,839
It's gotten so every would-be
gunman on the frontier

221
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,500
wants the honor of
putting him in Boot Hill.

222
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,977
You know how it is when
a man gets a reputation.

223
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:28,503
I sure do.

224
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,809
Where is Holliday?

225
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:31,373
I better get to him
while the getting's good.

226
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,441
He's at the hotel.

227
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,248
Keep that steak warm,
I'll be back.

228
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:36,619
You ain't missing much;
it's longhorn.

229
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,809
Holliday.

230
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,121
Sit down, make
yourself at home,

231
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:14,353
just like you were invited.

232
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:15,826
I don't know if you
remember me...

233
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:17,088
I remember you...
Wyatt Earp.

234
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,689
Pulled a tooth for you
ten years ago.

235
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:21,495
If I knew
when I had you in the chair

236
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:24,303
what you were going to turn out
to be, I...

237
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,931
I hear you've taken up
a new occupation.

238
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:28,769
It's too bad;
you were a good dentist.

239
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,742
My patients didn't
like my coughing.

240
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,977
I'd like some information.

241
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:39,246
The name of this game
is solitaire.

242
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:42,721
I'm in a position to do
a little horse trading.

243
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:43,881
Good evening,
Mr. Earp.

244
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:45,618
I know something
that would interest you.

245
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,626
You don't know a thing
that would interest me.

246
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:56,661
Suppose I was to tell you
that Ed Bailey...

247
00:13:56,736 --> 00:13:58,931
has a small derringer
hidden in his boot.

248
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,063
Left or right?

249
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,504
Left.

250
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,565
I'd say that was
good information...

251
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:04,940
Bailey's left-handed.

252
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,137
Ike Clanton and Johnny Ringo

253
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,577
rode through here
three days ago.

254
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:08,773
You played cards with them.

255
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:10,042
Which way were they heading?

256
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:11,071
Beats me.

257
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:12,482
I thought we were
making a deal.

258
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,485
That's what you said.

259
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,645
I didn't make any deals.

260
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,450
But you know where
they went, don't you?

261
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:18,650
Look, you're
interrupting my game.

262
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:37,640
You've got a real big hate
for the law, haven't you?

263
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:39,804
Is there any reason
why I shouldn't?

264
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:40,971
Your brother, Morgan,

265
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:42,674
ran me out
of Deadwood last year

266
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,240
and impounded $10,000
of my money.

267
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:47,445
As a matter of fact,
you've got brothers

268
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:50,080
marshaling all over
the frontier, haven't you?

269
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:53,221
I'll see you again,
Holliday.

270
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:54,783
If you're around.

271
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:12,073
What did you find out?

272
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:13,476
Not a thing.

273
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:15,173
It's my hunch they're
headed for Tombstone.

274
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:17,375
Ike's old man has
a big ranch there.

275
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,815
But I can't be sure.

276
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:21,149
Isn't your brother Virgil
a marshal at Tombstone?

277
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:22,711
That's right.

278
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,518
I sent him a telegram,
asking him to be

279
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:26,286
on the lookout for him,
just in case.

280
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:27,417
What are you going to do?

281
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,654
There's nothing I can do.

282
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:29,991
The trail's ice cold.

283
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:32,088
I'm heading back for Dodge City
in the morning.

284
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:12,469
Mr. Holliday.

285
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:13,597
Yes.

286
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:16,266
Would you care to settle up
your bill now?

287
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,468
Well, uh...

288
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:18,805
What I mean, sir, is

289
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:21,813
we didn't know whether you
were checking out or not.

290
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:24,280
You'll have word
in 15 minutes.

291
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:58,611
Doc, you're walking
into a stacked deck.

292
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:00,551
If Bailey don't get you,
the marshal will.

293
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:03,111
You'd be smart to get out
while you can.

294
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:07,793
You act as if you want
to get killed.

295
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:14,157
Maybe I do.

296
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:18,935
Holliday...

297
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:20,563
let's check your gun.

298
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:40,224
Good evening, Harry.

299
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:41,817
The usual.

300
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,327
Yes, sir.

301
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:48,623
I understand
there's a gentleman

302
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:50,999
in from Fort Worth
to see me.

303
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:54,532
This gentleman should have
taught his brother better

304
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:55,972
than to deal with a marked deck.

305
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:59,239
Well, if you happen to see
this, uh... gentleman,

306
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:04,238
tell him I'll be waiting
for him at Boot Hill.

307
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:06,751
He'll have only one direction
to travel from there...

308
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:07,774
down.

309
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:14,617
Come to think of it...

310
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,287
he's no gentleman at all.

311
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:18,489
He's a son of a yellow-bellied sow.

312
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:34,606
All right, Doc, let's go.

313
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:37,343
Right on cue.

314
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:39,078
What's the charge?

315
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,415
We'll think of one.

316
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,386
I'm sure you will.

317
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,787
Thanks, Harry.

318
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:53,154
All right, get him out of here.

319
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:54,199
It's all over, folks.

320
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:55,200
Break it up.

321
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,428
Come on, step up to the bar.

322
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:57,833
Free drinks, on the house.

323
00:18:57,903 --> 00:18:59,097
Come on, give me
some beer, bartender.

324
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:03,671
Ah, it's always a mess
after a killing.

325
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,734
Looks like Doc spoiled
everybody's fun.

326
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,836
He's crazy, but he's
got nerve, though...

327
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,279
plenty of nerve.

328
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,647
Shanssey, Mr. Earp, what are you
going to about this?

329
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:12,742
You saw what happened.

330
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:14,478
They had no right
to take Doc off.

331
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,579
They're going to do something
to him, I know it.

332
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:17,589
Kate Fisher,
friend of Doc's.

333
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:18,851
He's going to be framed.

334
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:20,381
You saw it...
Bailey pulled a gun on him.

335
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:21,916
Wait a minute, Miss Fisher,
take it easy.

336
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:23,986
Why don't you just relax
and let the law handle this.

337
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:25,360
There ain't no law
in this town.

338
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:27,558
I never saw a man beg more
to get his brains blown out.

339
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:28,861
Please, you've got
to help him.

340
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:30,060
Doc Holliday's none
of my business.

341
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:31,193
Please, Mr. Earp.

342
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,567
I don't want
any part of him.

343
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:33,605
I don't even like him.

344
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:34,606
I'm sorry.

345
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,607
Good night.

346
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:41,977
Kate, I can have a
pair of saddle horses

347
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,709
put round back
of the hotel.

348
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:45,114
That's as much as I can do.

349
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,640
With the feeling
against Doc,

350
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,710
I wouldn't stay in
business ten minutes

351
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:50,244
if they knew
I'd helped him.

352
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,357
Ten, please.

353
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:15,606
Wilson live here?

354
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:17,046
Why, no, sir.

355
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:18,811
They're just holding
Doc Holliday

356
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:20,011
upstairs in his room.

357
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,349
Oh.

358
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:06,830
Mr. Earp.

359
00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:08,833
Look, Miss Fisher, I told you
this is none of my business.

360
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:10,402
I don't care what you
think of me and Doc.

361
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:12,029
There's a lynch mob
starting across the street.

362
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,731
That's your business,
ain't it?

363
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:18,803
Don't make no difference
whether Doc is right or wrong.

364
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:21,506
He don't deserve to be hung
by a pack of animals.

365
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:20,204
You're getting out of here.

366
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:21,330
Since when have you taken

367
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:22,873
to rescuing gamblers
in distress?

368
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:24,671
Don't take it personal, Doc.

369
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,610
I just don't like lynchings.

370
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:31,113
What are we waiting for?

371
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,310
Not yet.

372
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:44,094
I'd say now is
a very good time.

373
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:07,584
Hey, Sturges' barn!

374
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:24,701
That's it.

375
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,101
Get going down
the back stairs.

376
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:27,900
Much obliged, Marshal.

377
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,740
I'll see you in Dodge City
and thank you properly.

378
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:37,180
You can thank me properly
by staying out of Dodge City.

379
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:40,481
More water!
More water!

380
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:01,803
...Boot Hill

381
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,398
Boot Hill, Boot Hill,
Boot Hill

382
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:04,669
Boot Hill

383
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:05,972
In the air, there's a chill,
there's a chill

384
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:07,239
So cold

385
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,246
Mighty cold, mighty cold,
mighty cold

386
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,645
So still

387
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:10,648
Mighty still, mighty still,
mighty still

388
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:15,483
Wyatt Earp, they say,
saved Doc Holliday

389
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:20,958
From old Boot Hill...

390
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:28,700
Boot Hill

391
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,792
Boot Hill, Boot Hill,
Boot Hill

392
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:31,096
Boot Hill

393
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:32,500
Over there, there's a chill,
there's a chill

394
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:33,799
So cold

395
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:34,931
Mighty cold, mighty cold,
mighty cold

396
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:36,338
So still

397
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:38,138
Mighty still, mighty still,
mighty still

398
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:41,976
Wyatt roamed the West,
and though he fought the best

399
00:24:42,014 --> 00:24:46,781
By nature he preferred it
nice and peaceful

400
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,683
Sort of slow

401
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,018
And sort of easy-go

402
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:54,116
But he was quick on the draw

403
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,684
And Wyatt's word was law

404
00:24:56,728 --> 00:25:03,258
Was law, was law...

405
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,073
Whoa.

406
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:25,188
How about that?

407
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:32,986
A little out of place
for Dodge City,

408
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:34,157
wouldn't you say?

409
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,723
That's strictly
big-city stuff.

410
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:37,769
Looks like she's going
to stay a while.

411
00:25:37,803 --> 00:25:38,792
Got a trunk.

412
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:45,373
I got to go on a posse.

413
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:47,401
That's what I came
to see you about.

414
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:49,003
Chief Dullknife is
on a rampage again.

415
00:25:49,081 --> 00:25:50,844
I'm going to have
to borrow your deputies.

416
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:52,406
You're always short of men.

417
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:54,519
Who's the girl?

418
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:55,520
Yeah, who's the girl?

419
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:56,543
Girl? What girl?

420
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:02,950
Oh. I was too busy finding out

421
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:06,157
that Doc Holliday and his
lady friend have just checked in

422
00:26:06,198 --> 00:26:07,222
at the Dodge House.

423
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:08,755
Doc Holliday?

424
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:10,767
I told him to keep out
of Dodge City.

425
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:12,769
I'd better get over there
before he unpacks.

426
00:26:12,838 --> 00:26:14,465
You going to lend me
your deputies?

427
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:15,473
Well, all right,

428
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:17,134
but I have to keep
Charlie here with me.

429
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:18,574
You can have the
rest of the boys.

430
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,805
And don't forget to get back
before those cattle drives.

431
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:23,312
You know how business picks up
when the cowpokes hit town.

432
00:26:31,123 --> 00:26:34,024
Mario, go on out
and get some fresh air.

433
00:26:36,495 --> 00:26:38,520
The mayor's
welcoming committee, eh?

434
00:26:38,563 --> 00:26:41,157
I thought I told you
to stay out of Dodge City.

435
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:43,793
I like a sharp razor,
don't you?

436
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:45,427
Care for a shave?

437
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,031
There's a stage for Abilene
in the morning.

438
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,872
I want you to be on it.

439
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:54,071
Can't.

440
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:56,808
The marshal of Abilene
sent me here.

441
00:26:56,848 --> 00:26:58,281
As a matter of fact,

442
00:26:58,316 --> 00:27:00,216
I wish someone would write
you fellas a new speech.

443
00:27:00,252 --> 00:27:02,720
I've had the same one
in the last five towns.

444
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:04,745
All right, you'll stay
in your hotel room, then,

445
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,189
till day after tomorrow.

446
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:08,249
I'll personally escort you
to the westbound train.

447
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:11,228
Wyatt, you've got
to face a hard fact.

448
00:27:11,263 --> 00:27:14,699
I'm in a state of complete
financial collapse.

449
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:17,758
I don't even have
the price of a ticket.

450
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:19,770
Shanssey told me you had
quite a bankroll

451
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:20,772
back there in Griffin.

452
00:27:20,906 --> 00:27:22,339
Shanssey ought to know.

453
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:24,467
He had $10,000 of mine
in his safe.

454
00:27:24,543 --> 00:27:26,170
You know what that
son of a gun did?

455
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:28,576
You'll recall I had to leave
town rather hastily.

456
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:30,581
Those two horses in
back of the hotel

457
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:32,310
cost me $5,000 apiece.

458
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,817
Now, how about that?

459
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:34,977
Towel, please.

460
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:38,250
Oh, thank you.

461
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,683
Everyone puts such an outlandish value

462
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:43,660
on my life.

463
00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:47,959
Say, Wyatt...

464
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,296
how much do you earn?

465
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:51,426
About $100 a month
and two dollars an arrest?

466
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,698
You trying to bribe me?

467
00:27:53,738 --> 00:27:54,705
Oh, no.

468
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:56,229
Not you.

469
00:27:56,308 --> 00:27:59,539
I feel compelled to offer you
an honest business proposition.

470
00:28:00,946 --> 00:28:02,504
That's not bad.

471
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:03,639
You got any money saved?

472
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,149
Some.

473
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,651
Going to buy a small ranch
or a country store someday, huh?

474
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,415
Well, I'll make it easier
for you.

475
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:11,479
You stake me
to a thousand dollars

476
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,218
and I'll split my winnings.

477
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:15,692
The cowboys are coming
and the stakes will be big.

478
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:17,217
Fifty-fifty, huh?

479
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:19,025
Now actually,
any number of people

480
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:21,658
would be glad to back me
for ten percent, but...

481
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,600
I like you, Wyatt Earp.

482
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:25,966
I like your cut.

483
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:27,904
Why so generous
with the split?

484
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:29,338
Look, a barber needs this.

485
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,069
You're a lawman,
you need a gun.

486
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:32,167
I'm a gambler.

487
00:28:32,244 --> 00:28:34,439
Money's just a tool
of my trade.

488
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:36,913
Of course, you will
guarantee you won't lose.

489
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:39,576
I never lose.

490
00:28:39,618 --> 00:28:41,245
You see, poker's played
by desperate men

491
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:42,344
who cherish money.

492
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,150
I don't lose because
I have nothing to lose,

493
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:45,178
including my life.

494
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,247
Is it a deal?

495
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:49,452
Of all the low-down gall.

496
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:51,223
Ah, well...

497
00:28:51,263 --> 00:28:53,231
You're just going
to have to stake me

498
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:54,526
to a railroad ticket.

499
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:03,331
Holliday, I've done

500
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,876
some foolish things
in my life.

501
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:08,003
I'm about to do another.

502
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:09,604
I'm going to let you
stay in town.

503
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:13,744
Why so generous?

504
00:29:13,818 --> 00:29:16,753
Let's say I like your cut.

505
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:19,518
You can stay and you can play
on one condition:

506
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:21,583
No knives, no guns
and no killings.

507
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,959
No knives, no guns, no killings.

508
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:29,057
That's it.

509
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:31,762
You have my word
as a gentleman.

510
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,735
Just one more thing.

511
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:36,104
You ought to treat that woman
decent or leave her.

512
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:37,768
Kate?

513
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:39,137
Yes, poor old Kate.

514
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:42,305
She stands for everything I hate
in Doc Holliday.

515
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:44,679
Oh, leave two bits
for the barber, will you?

516
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,751
Well, I found out all about your lady fair.

517
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,158
Hey, where'd you
get the new gun?

518
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:57,456
Buntline made it for me special.

519
00:29:57,495 --> 00:29:58,462
What lady fair?

520
00:29:58,496 --> 00:29:59,360
It's sure beautiful...

521
00:29:59,397 --> 00:30:00,455
isn't that barrel too long?

522
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:01,624
No, good balance,
just right.

523
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,632
What's beautiful?

524
00:30:02,701 --> 00:30:03,668
Hand-tooled, too, huh?

525
00:30:03,702 --> 00:30:04,828
What are you talking about?

526
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:06,063
Well, that girl that came in

527
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:07,604
on the stage
day before yesterday.

528
00:30:07,672 --> 00:30:09,162
Oh, yeah, I remember;
what about her?

529
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,071
Well, she's staying over at Mrs. D's place.

530
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:12,576
They tell me she's got a trunkful

531
00:30:12,611 --> 00:30:14,602
of the most elegant clothes
you've ever seen.

532
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,773
Some of them dresses
clean from Paris, France.

533
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,715
She's five-foot six,

534
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,377
weighs 120 pounds,

535
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:21,385
red hair, green eyes...

536
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:22,647
What is she doing here?

537
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:23,676
Gambler.

538
00:30:25,256 --> 00:30:26,245
Very funny.

539
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,291
Well, if you think that's funny,

540
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:31,659
why don't you take a little walk

541
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:33,425
over to the Longbranch Saloon.

542
00:30:33,465 --> 00:30:34,693
You'll die laughing.

543
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:50,372
Hello, Wyatt.

544
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:54,546
What's the trouble?

545
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:56,713
I think I'm going to have
to break up that game.

546
00:30:56,755 --> 00:30:57,722
Can't do that, Wyatt.

547
00:30:57,756 --> 00:30:59,280
There's no law against
women gambling.

548
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:01,519
I know, but every time
there's a woman at the tables,

549
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:02,821
there's trouble, you know that.

550
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:07,259
Sorry, game's over.

551
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:09,300
Wyatt, this is Laura Denbow.

552
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,927
Kelly, you're the mayor of this town.

553
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:11,991
We agreed there'd be

554
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,560
no women gambling
on the north side.

555
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:15,469
Miss Denbow's marker
is respected

556
00:31:15,507 --> 00:31:17,372
for $10,000 anywhere
in the West.

557
00:31:17,409 --> 00:31:18,876
We all consider her
an exception.

558
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:20,740
Not in Dodge City,
she isn't.

559
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:23,839
So you're the famous Wyatt Earp.

560
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,509
Lawman, judge and jury.

561
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,677
That's right, Miss Gambler...
start with you

562
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,517
and we'll have every tramp
on the south side over here.

563
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:31,817
Who's a tramp?

564
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:33,585
Shut up and keep
out of this, cowboy.

565
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:35,252
You're talking to a lady!

566
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:37,420
It appears the marshal
hasn't met a lady before.

567
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:39,225
You're in a saloon,
playing a man's game.

568
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,856
Why should you be
treated like a lady?

569
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:42,661
And you ain't no gentleman.

570
00:31:44,135 --> 00:31:45,602
That's all for tonight,
Miss Denbow.

571
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:47,161
Take your hands off her.

572
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:54,536
Hold it, Charlie.

573
00:31:56,514 --> 00:31:59,483
I'm tired of you
pushing people around.

574
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:00,484
Now, go for your gun.

575
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:01,815
I'm going to kill you!

576
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:03,946
I don't have a gun, cowboy.

577
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:05,148
I'm unarmed.

578
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,259
Stay where you are!

579
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,358
You're drunk.

580
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:17,959
You don't know
what you're doing.

581
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:21,771
Now, give me that gun before
you get into real trouble.

582
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:28,075
I don't stand for nobody talking

583
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:29,705
like that to no lady.

584
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:33,316
You stand real still.

585
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,978
And just give me that gun.

586
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:01,744
I ain't no gunman.

587
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:05,610
I couldn't kill anybody.

588
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:07,640
I know that, cowboy.

589
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,047
You were just trying
to impress the lady.

590
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,216
Charlie...

591
00:33:13,258 --> 00:33:14,919
take him down
and sober him up

592
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:16,358
and get him out of town.

593
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:20,796
You're under arrest.

594
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,094
For what, Mr. Earp?

595
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:23,998
You just saw it...
disturbing the peace.

596
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:25,092
Wait a minute, Wyatt.

597
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,637
It's all right, Mayor Kelly.

598
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:28,968
The marshal's only
trying to save

599
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,975
the good name of Dodge City.

600
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,341
Besides, I might like
to see the inside of a jail.

601
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:37,810
Don't you think you better wait
for a few of your deputies?

602
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:38,941
I might be desperate.

603
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:01,230
I'll let you go,
if you promise

604
00:34:01,306 --> 00:34:02,967
to do your gambling
south of the deadline.

605
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:04,167
South of the deadline?

606
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:08,237
No, I think I'll stay.

607
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:10,839
Perhaps the judge isn't as
righteous as the marshal.

608
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:15,383
Well, aren't you going
to open the door?

609
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:26,023
Oh, I, uh...

610
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:27,758
won't be needing these
while I'm here.

611
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:30,201
Why don't you buy
yourself a new halo?

612
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:31,759
The one you're wearing's
too tight.

613
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:37,741
Close the door, Marshal.

614
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:54,358
Locked her up?

615
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:58,226
That's right,
disturbing the peace.

616
00:34:58,263 --> 00:34:59,855
I could get her out.

617
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:02,957
$500 says you can't.

618
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:04,797
Make it the $1,000
I owe you.

619
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:08,869
Double or nothing.

620
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:10,767
It's a bet.

621
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:16,946
I'll be back in 30 minutes.

622
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:32,329
Good evening, Charlie.

623
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:33,387
Oh, hiya, Doc.

624
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:38,500
Man, this 12 on and 12 off
is sure ruining my homework.

625
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:48,976
I spend half my life
on that dern paperwork.

626
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:50,981
Care for a nip?

627
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:53,415
Doc, you know why I don't
like drinking on duty.

628
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:57,551
What's the occasion?

629
00:35:57,588 --> 00:35:59,556
I'd like to bail out
Miss Denbow.

630
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:01,387
Hit me.

631
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:04,250
I got 19.

632
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:05,284
Twenty.

633
00:36:07,598 --> 00:36:08,758
Can't do it, Doc.

634
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,461
She's got to appear
in court tomorrow.

635
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:11,968
No bail's been set yet.

636
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,440
Think I'll stand on these.

637
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:21,472
Twenty-one.

638
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:25,913
Oh, I'll wait for Wyatt.

639
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:29,813
I sure hope Bat gets
back with our deputies

640
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,378
before them cowboys
hit town.

641
00:36:33,091 --> 00:36:34,115
Blackjack.

642
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:35,455
I got one, too.

643
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:46,597
You know, Doc, if we
was playing for real,

644
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:49,105
I'd just be compelled
to have a look at that deck.

645
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,404
Oh, I'd be compelled
to ask you to try it.

646
00:36:53,077 --> 00:36:54,044
Use mine, huh?

647
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:57,708
Good thing Wyatt
don't let us

648
00:36:57,749 --> 00:36:59,046
go around drawing
these things.

649
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:00,107
Somebody might get hurt.

650
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:04,582
Well... I got to go have a look

651
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:06,453
at the prisoners and horses.

652
00:37:06,491 --> 00:37:08,118
Watch the office for me,
will you, Doc?

653
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:09,319
Sure thing, Charlie.

654
00:37:26,778 --> 00:37:28,769
I never could get the hang
of these things.

655
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:30,542
What are you doing here?

656
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:32,515
Wyatt, I'd like to
bail out Miss Denbow.

657
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,245
She happens to be a lady.

658
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,911
No favors, Holliday.

659
00:37:37,955 --> 00:37:39,047
Let's say you release her

660
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,557
in exchange for
some information.

661
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:45,686
You don't know a thing
that would interest me.

662
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:48,630
Uh, suppose I
were to tell you

663
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:50,792
that Shanghai Pierce is
bringing his herd here.

664
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:53,602
Shanghai Pierce, huh?

665
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:55,832
I take it you've had
some run-ins with him.

666
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:58,505
I had to bat him over the head

667
00:37:58,543 --> 00:38:01,239
once or twice, when he got drunk
and tried to shoot up Wichita.

668
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,974
Not a bad guy,
just forgot to grow up.

669
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:04,982
Well, he's aiming
to shoot up Dodge City,

670
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:07,849
and he's hired Ringo to make
sure you don't spoil his fun.

671
00:38:07,885 --> 00:38:10,752
Oh, and what's more, he, uh...

672
00:38:10,822 --> 00:38:14,758
He's put a price of $1,000
on your head, dead.

673
00:38:14,826 --> 00:38:16,691
What else is new?

674
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:18,991
Well, I, I thought
it was kind of amusing,

675
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,497
a price on a lawman's head.

676
00:38:20,565 --> 00:38:23,261
Look, Holliday,

677
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:24,460
as long as I'm the law here,

678
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:25,661
not one of those cowpokes

679
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:27,966
is going to cross
that deadline with a gun.

680
00:38:28,005 --> 00:38:30,496
I don't care if his name
is Shanghai Pierce.

681
00:38:30,575 --> 00:38:31,667
Well spoken.

682
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:34,609
I'll repeat those words
at your funeral.

683
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:38,613
How about releasing
Miss Denbow?

684
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:41,311
Nothing doing.

685
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:43,980
Look, you made a deal.

686
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:45,113
You made the deal.

687
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,714
I didn't agree to
a thing, remember?

688
00:38:49,026 --> 00:38:51,620
Charlie, you're working
for a crook.

689
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:52,629
Oh, yeah?

690
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:53,823
Go on home, Charlie,
and turn in.

691
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:54,956
I'll finish these reports.

692
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,660
Thanks.
Everything's quiet.

693
00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:57,702
Good night.

694
00:38:57,702 --> 00:38:58,930
G'night.

695
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:01,972
Wyatt, you ought
to turn her loose.

696
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:04,303
She's got no business
behind bars.

697
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,778
I think Charlie's right.

698
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,279
Let her out.

699
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,153
Conscience?

700
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,385
Maybe I like her.

701
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:22,517
Tell Kelly

702
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,084
she's to play
in the side room.

703
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:26,323
I don't want her gambling
on the main floor.

704
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:28,855
Good evening, Miss Denbow.

705
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:29,889
Good evening.

706
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:34,263
Come on, Laura, we've got
business to take care of.

707
00:39:34,338 --> 00:39:35,305
Thank you.

708
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:42,479
Marshal.

709
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:53,012
Good evening, Mr. Earp.

710
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:55,617
Good evening, Miss Denbow.

711
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,991
Good evening, Mr. Earp.

712
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:06,799
Pair of deuces.

713
00:40:06,837 --> 00:40:08,429
I'll check to the lady.

714
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:09,473
Fifty.

715
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:10,474
I'll stay.

716
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:11,475
Too steep for me.

717
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,499
I'm in.

718
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:15,170
$50, and I'll
make it $50 more.

719
00:40:15,213 --> 00:40:16,180
I'm in for the $50.

720
00:40:16,214 --> 00:40:17,181
Deal.

721
00:40:17,215 --> 00:40:18,182
Doc...

722
00:40:18,216 --> 00:40:19,183
Queen of clubs.

723
00:40:19,217 --> 00:40:20,184
It's almost morning.

724
00:40:20,218 --> 00:40:22,277
Jack of spades, three tens.

725
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,844
You didn't answer me.

726
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:24,877
I'll make it $100.

727
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:25,889
Doc!

728
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:28,050
Go buy yourself a drink.

729
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,423
And I'll raise you $100.

730
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,449
Too much for me.

731
00:40:30,494 --> 00:40:32,485
$200 to me.

732
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:33,497
I'll call you.

733
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:35,158
I'll go along with the lady.

734
00:40:35,233 --> 00:40:37,134
Four deuces.

735
00:40:37,134 --> 00:40:38,536
Gentlemen, we've been
out-classed.

736
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:39,833
Thank you, gentlemen.

737
00:40:39,904 --> 00:40:41,064
I think I'll call it a night.

738
00:40:41,138 --> 00:40:42,196
Will you cash me in, Frank?

739
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,240
Good night.

740
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:43,933
Good night, Mayor Kelly.

741
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:44,939
May I see you home?

742
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:45,940
No, thank you, Doc.

743
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:46,941
Good night.

744
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:48,136
Good night.

745
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:49,612
How about a little draw, boys?

746
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:50,671
All right.

747
00:40:50,715 --> 00:40:53,343
I'll get my ante in there.

748
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:54,373
Good night.

749
00:41:13,738 --> 00:41:14,796
Johnny, I need Luke Short.

750
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:16,100
Richie Bell
and two of his boys

751
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:17,299
held up the bank at Salina.

752
00:41:17,375 --> 00:41:18,706
They killed the cashier.

753
00:41:18,743 --> 00:41:19,732
They're heading this way.

754
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,004
I sent Luke to Abilene, Wyatt.

755
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:22,672
I'm sorry.

756
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:24,112
How soon do you
have to pull out?

757
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:28,141
Right away, if I expect
to pick up their trail.

758
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:29,812
Doggone it, Luke's
the only one in town

759
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:30,821
who can handle a gun.

760
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:32,880
What about Charlie Bassett?

761
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:34,447
Somebody's got to mind the town.

762
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:35,652
Want a gunhand?

763
00:41:36,761 --> 00:41:38,388
You?

764
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:39,623
No, thanks.

765
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:42,189
I do handle one pretty well.

766
00:41:42,233 --> 00:41:43,257
The only trouble is

767
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,325
those best able
to testify to my aim

768
00:41:45,403 --> 00:41:46,870
aren't around for comment.

769
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:48,734
I'll take care of it alone.

770
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:50,034
Suit yourself.

771
00:42:01,218 --> 00:42:03,652
Hold up your right hand.

772
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:05,679
Do you solemnly
swear to uphold...

773
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:06,690
Oh, this is ridiculous!

774
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:07,691
You're deputized.

775
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:09,215
Grab some gear,
I'll get the horses.

776
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,387
Now, wait a minute, don't
I get to wear a tin star?

777
00:42:11,429 --> 00:42:12,623
Not on your life!

778
00:43:06,016 --> 00:43:07,176
Medicine.

779
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:16,727
For a smart gambler, you
sure play sucker odds.

780
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:19,025
You're going to be dead
inside of a year.

781
00:43:19,063 --> 00:43:21,327
What do you know
about odds, preacher?

782
00:43:21,399 --> 00:43:23,299
This kind of cough
doesn't go away.

783
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:25,335
Why don't you get out of
those stinking saloons?

784
00:43:25,403 --> 00:43:26,961
Pack up and go live
in the mountains.

785
00:43:27,037 --> 00:43:28,561
Not me.

786
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:30,800
You're just ornery enough
to live to a ripe old age.

787
00:43:30,841 --> 00:43:33,401
No, I'm not going to let it
drain me out slow.

788
00:43:35,413 --> 00:43:36,812
Sure.

789
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:38,872
Play it hard and fast.

790
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:39,881
Listen, Wyatt,

791
00:43:39,984 --> 00:43:41,474
the only thing
I'm really scared of

792
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:42,543
is dying in bed.

793
00:43:42,586 --> 00:43:44,884
I don't want to go
little by little.

794
00:43:44,989 --> 00:43:46,889
Someday, somebody's
got to out-shoot me,

795
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:48,618
and it'll be
over with real quick.

796
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:53,430
Earp, I didn't come along
to hear you preach a sermon.

797
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:56,861
You know, I've been wondering
about that.

798
00:44:00,704 --> 00:44:01,728
Why did you come?

799
00:44:01,772 --> 00:44:03,569
Well, if I stick around
long enough,

800
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:06,508
sooner or later you've got
to put your head in a noose.

801
00:44:06,544 --> 00:44:07,670
I'm going to bail you out.

802
00:44:09,046 --> 00:44:10,809
I've only got one debt
in this world,

803
00:44:10,848 --> 00:44:12,406
and I don't like
owing it to you.

804
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:14,441
You don't owe me a thing.

805
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:16,009
I've never needed
anybody in my life,

806
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:17,520
and I sure don't need
Doc Holliday.

807
00:44:17,555 --> 00:44:19,420
You're pretty positive
about that.

808
00:44:19,457 --> 00:44:20,651
As far as I'm concerned,

809
00:44:20,691 --> 00:44:22,556
you can get on your horse
and keep riding.

810
00:44:25,095 --> 00:44:26,585
No, thanks.

811
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:27,688
I think I'll stay.

812
00:44:31,902 --> 00:44:35,770
You know, Wyatt, you and I
are pretty much alike, actually.

813
00:44:35,806 --> 00:44:37,398
Both of us live with a gun.

814
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:39,432
The only difference
is that badge.

815
00:44:40,478 --> 00:44:41,638
What's the matter,
preacher?

816
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,078
Don't you like
being preached at?

817
00:44:43,113 --> 00:44:44,546
Shut up and go to sleep.

818
00:45:59,857 --> 00:46:03,156
Richie Bell won't
be robbing any more banks.

819
00:46:03,193 --> 00:46:04,455
I thought you were asleep.

820
00:46:05,462 --> 00:46:07,453
No, it figured.

821
00:46:07,498 --> 00:46:08,966
Let's head back to Dodge.

822
00:46:08,966 --> 00:46:10,297
I want to get in a bed.

823
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:11,459
What for?

824
00:46:11,535 --> 00:46:12,695
They're not going any place.

825
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:13,737
Neither are we.

826
00:46:13,804 --> 00:46:14,998
I'm getting some sleep.

827
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:22,211
Get out of those
stinking saloons.

828
00:46:22,246 --> 00:46:26,945
Pack up, live
in the mountains.

829
00:46:37,194 --> 00:46:38,161
Charlie.

830
00:46:38,195 --> 00:46:39,423
Hi.

831
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,658
I'll go in and fix up
a coroner's report.

832
00:46:41,699 --> 00:46:43,326
Thanks a lot, Doc.

833
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:44,389
You and I are even.

834
00:46:45,502 --> 00:46:46,628
Not yet.

835
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:50,202
Not until the debt's
paid in full, Marshal.

836
00:46:55,379 --> 00:46:58,041
I hear you did some
pretty fancy shooting, Doc.

837
00:46:58,082 --> 00:46:59,549
Well, it's...

838
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:02,051
all in a day's work
for a deputy.

839
00:47:03,954 --> 00:47:05,421
You all right?

840
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:10,555
Find Kate and tell her

841
00:47:10,594 --> 00:47:12,494
to come up to the hotel
right away, will you?

842
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:14,429
Kate hasn't been around
for a while, Doc.

843
00:47:14,465 --> 00:47:16,092
What do you mean?

844
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:18,566
I mean nobody's seen her
on this side of town

845
00:47:18,636 --> 00:47:20,399
since you rode out.

846
00:47:22,773 --> 00:47:24,638
Should I get a doctor?

847
00:48:00,244 --> 00:48:01,506
Good morning, Laura.

848
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:03,638
Well, I never thought
I'd be glad to see you.

849
00:48:03,681 --> 00:48:04,739
Something wrong?

850
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:06,407
My horse has gone lame.

851
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:07,439
Right forefoot.

852
00:48:17,094 --> 00:48:18,118
Hoof's split.

853
00:48:18,162 --> 00:48:19,459
Better not ride him in.

854
00:48:19,496 --> 00:48:20,758
Aw...

855
00:48:20,864 --> 00:48:22,889
Leave him here,
he won't go far.

856
00:48:22,966 --> 00:48:24,627
I'll send
the blacksmith out.

857
00:48:24,668 --> 00:48:26,260
Nice you
happened along.

858
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:29,766
I didn't happen along.

859
00:48:31,475 --> 00:48:33,375
I know you ride out
this way every day.

860
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,043
Come on, I'll give you
a ride into town.

861
00:48:44,888 --> 00:48:46,651
Unless you'd rather
walk six miles.

862
00:48:58,702 --> 00:49:00,260
Better hold on tight.

863
00:49:03,841 --> 00:49:04,808
Tighter.

864
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:39,741
Doc, what are you doing up
this time of day?

865
00:49:39,777 --> 00:49:41,244
It's only 3:00.

866
00:49:41,278 --> 00:49:42,939
I'm on a health bender.

867
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,574
Up before noon,
take a 20-yard walk.

868
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:52,054
What's the action here?

869
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:56,423
Uh, picking up the hardware
as soon as the cowboys hit town.

870
00:49:57,795 --> 00:50:00,127
Sure don't look like
Bat's going to get back

871
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:01,722
with our deputies soon enough.

872
00:50:01,799 --> 00:50:02,925
Where's Kate?

873
00:50:07,104 --> 00:50:08,571
Where is she, Charlie?

874
00:50:10,774 --> 00:50:12,867
Well, it's...
kind of touchy, Doc.

875
00:50:12,943 --> 00:50:15,173
I... I...

876
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:16,304
Yes?

877
00:50:20,717 --> 00:50:21,979
You promised Wyatt

878
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:23,748
there wouldn't be
any gunplay, Doc.

879
00:50:23,787 --> 00:50:24,754
Now, you can't...

880
00:50:24,788 --> 00:50:26,187
Where is she, Charlie?

881
00:50:29,193 --> 00:50:30,592
Wally's Hotel.

882
00:50:30,627 --> 00:50:33,061
Ringo blew into town, and
Kate's taken up with him.

883
00:50:40,337 --> 00:50:42,464
Sure is a lot of beef
coming in here.

884
00:50:45,142 --> 00:50:46,803
This is just the beginning.

885
00:50:46,844 --> 00:50:47,833
Wait till the...

886
00:50:47,911 --> 00:50:49,606
Look, Doc,
a gunfight right now

887
00:50:49,646 --> 00:50:51,580
could cause Wyatt
a lot of trouble.

888
00:50:51,615 --> 00:50:53,276
A lot of trouble.

889
00:50:54,284 --> 00:50:55,774
Sure is a mess
of cattle here.

890
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:36,550
Get out and stay out,
you no-good tramp!

891
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:37,753
And don't come back!

892
00:51:58,982 --> 00:52:02,281
Widened my mind...

893
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:08,656
My mind is to marry, love,
and leave you behind.

894
00:52:16,533 --> 00:52:18,433
So you got homesick.

895
00:52:21,672 --> 00:52:23,105
Well, well.

896
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:24,505
If it ain't
the little deputy.

897
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:26,873
You've been gone
for three days.

898
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,774
I didn't think you'd notice.

899
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:30,746
You've been gallivanting
all over the country

900
00:52:30,781 --> 00:52:31,805
with Mr. Virtue.

901
00:52:31,848 --> 00:52:33,315
I was sick, Kate.

902
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:34,715
I needed you.

903
00:52:38,422 --> 00:52:40,583
Why don't you put a rope
around my neck and...

904
00:52:40,624 --> 00:52:42,489
and pull on it
when you want me?

905
00:52:42,526 --> 00:52:43,515
Can't stay away.

906
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:45,460
Just can't stay away,
can you?

907
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:46,962
Oh, leave me alone, Doc.

908
00:52:48,465 --> 00:52:51,059
Always got to crawl
back to your gutter.

909
00:52:51,134 --> 00:52:52,158
Maybe I wouldn't

910
00:52:52,235 --> 00:52:54,328
if you ever noticed
I was alive!

911
00:52:54,404 --> 00:52:55,894
What difference
does it make to you

912
00:52:55,973 --> 00:52:57,440
where I go or who
I take up with?

913
00:52:57,507 --> 00:52:58,838
Shut up!

914
00:53:01,078 --> 00:53:02,875
Get your things together,
you're leaving.

915
00:53:06,984 --> 00:53:08,315
She's staying here.

916
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:10,547
Keep out of this, Ringo.

917
00:53:10,587 --> 00:53:12,555
You got no right to
come busting in here.

918
00:53:12,589 --> 00:53:13,920
I'm talking to Kate.

919
00:53:13,957 --> 00:53:14,946
Take a walk.

920
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,451
Anything you got to say,
you can say in front of him.

921
00:53:22,833 --> 00:53:24,460
You slut.

922
00:53:24,501 --> 00:53:26,128
Wait a minute, Holliday.

923
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:28,831
You don't talk to
my woman like that.

924
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,502
"Your woman."

925
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:33,099
Anybody's woman.

926
00:53:33,143 --> 00:53:35,202
I'm going to
blast you apart.

927
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:38,338
I don't have a gun, Ringo.

928
00:53:44,788 --> 00:53:46,119
You got one now.

929
00:53:54,164 --> 00:53:55,791
Reach.

930
00:54:03,273 --> 00:54:04,968
I'm not fighting.

931
00:54:05,042 --> 00:54:06,566
He won't fight.

932
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:07,941
He promised Wyatt Earp

933
00:54:07,978 --> 00:54:09,377
he'd be a good little boy.

934
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:11,347
I heard you made
your reputation

935
00:54:11,381 --> 00:54:12,973
against a bunch of drunks.

936
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:16,376
Go on, reach.

937
00:54:22,125 --> 00:54:23,820
I'm not fighting.

938
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:26,361
Well, have a drink, then.

939
00:54:40,477 --> 00:54:41,739
Oh, Doc.

940
00:55:07,671 --> 00:55:08,763
It was a lovely dance.

941
00:55:08,905 --> 00:55:10,736
I'm sorry I have
to leave so soon.

942
00:55:10,774 --> 00:55:12,605
You're breaking
a lot of hearts.

943
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:13,768
Good night, Mayor Kelly.

944
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:15,004
Good night, Miss Denbow.

945
00:55:18,949 --> 00:55:20,382
May I take you somewhere?

946
00:55:20,417 --> 00:55:22,078
No, thank you,
it's just a short way.

947
00:55:22,119 --> 00:55:24,485
It's early, and I have
to ride up to the bluffs.

948
00:55:43,273 --> 00:55:45,104
Oh, it is lovely here.

949
00:55:45,142 --> 00:55:46,803
I'm glad I came.

950
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:08,365
You've lost your poker face.

951
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:10,230
You look like
a scared little girl.

952
00:56:11,268 --> 00:56:14,135
I'm not scared.

953
00:56:14,171 --> 00:56:17,163
And I'm certainly
not a little girl.

954
00:56:39,529 --> 00:56:41,463
Why did you come
out here with me?

955
00:56:44,668 --> 00:56:46,795
I wish I could answer that.

956
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:48,599
I don't know.

957
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:51,540
I'll tell you why you came.

958
00:57:26,876 --> 00:57:28,070
Frisky bunch, eh, Ringo?

959
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:29,669
Yeah.

960
00:57:36,186 --> 00:57:38,211
This ought to learn 'em
once and for all

961
00:57:38,255 --> 00:57:39,449
who owns the cow towns!

962
00:57:39,489 --> 00:57:40,649
Yeah.

963
00:57:44,995 --> 00:57:46,257
Shanghai Pierce is in town.

964
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:47,923
His men are hoo-hawing
Front Street.

965
00:57:47,998 --> 00:57:50,023
Now, see if you find Wyatt,
quick as you can

966
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:51,124
and get some help.

967
00:57:51,201 --> 00:57:52,793
I'll try to hold them off.

968
00:57:52,869 --> 00:57:54,860
I don't want anybody
out there on the streets!

969
00:58:02,712 --> 00:58:05,772
Pierce, call off your men
before somebody gets hurt.

970
00:58:07,183 --> 00:58:10,744
Tell your boss I'm waiting
for his personal invitation.

971
00:58:10,854 --> 00:58:12,446
You're under arrest, Pierce.

972
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:14,184
You hear that, Ringo?

973
00:58:14,224 --> 00:58:16,454
I'm under arrest.

974
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:17,551
I heard.

975
00:58:31,274 --> 00:58:32,798
Sure are noisy.

976
00:58:35,578 --> 00:58:37,944
Sure are.

977
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:41,817
Let's quit.

978
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:43,375
I want to get out of here.

979
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:44,819
You just keep dealing.

980
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:46,446
I'm not breaking this run.

981
00:58:46,489 --> 00:58:47,478
Hit me.

982
00:58:52,962 --> 00:58:54,554
Doc, please.

983
00:58:54,597 --> 00:58:55,859
Deal.

984
00:58:57,801 --> 00:59:00,929
Well... what have we here?

985
00:59:01,004 --> 00:59:01,902
A dance.

986
00:59:01,938 --> 00:59:03,803
Now, ain't that nice?

987
00:59:05,308 --> 00:59:08,539
You folks going
to invite us in?

988
00:59:08,578 --> 00:59:10,671
Ain't very hospitable,
are they, Boss?

989
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:13,342
You better get that scum
of yours south of the deadline.

990
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:15,112
You hear that, boys?

991
00:59:15,151 --> 00:59:18,245
These are respectable folks.

992
00:59:18,288 --> 00:59:20,449
They're good enough
to take our money.

993
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:22,924
I say my men are good enough
to dance with your women.

994
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:49,541
My boys want to dance!

995
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:52,612
Piano player, make some music!

996
00:59:55,024 --> 00:59:56,958
Make it lively!

997
01:00:18,148 --> 01:00:19,274
Hello, Shanghai.

998
01:00:19,315 --> 01:00:20,976
Well...

999
01:00:21,017 --> 01:00:24,851
Now my day is complete.

1000
01:00:24,888 --> 01:00:26,321
You and me are going to settle

1001
01:00:26,356 --> 01:00:28,153
for this scar
you gave me in Wichita.

1002
01:00:31,594 --> 01:00:32,856
Unbuckle your guns, boys,

1003
01:00:32,896 --> 01:00:34,659
and come on down
to the calaboose with me.

1004
01:00:34,731 --> 01:00:36,633
You better start praying, Earp.

1005
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:38,034
You pulled your last bluff.

1006
01:00:38,034 --> 01:00:39,160
Start thinking
straight, Shanghai,

1007
01:00:39,235 --> 01:00:40,463
before you get
into too much trouble

1008
01:00:40,537 --> 01:00:41,595
and you can't get out of it.

1009
01:00:41,671 --> 01:00:43,138
Let's work him over, Boss.

1010
01:00:43,206 --> 01:00:45,174
That's a real good idea.

1011
01:00:45,241 --> 01:00:47,801
Maybe your friends
would like to see

1012
01:00:47,844 --> 01:00:49,072
how tough you really are.

1013
01:00:49,112 --> 01:00:51,103
I'd like to see you
do a dance, Marshal.

1014
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:53,081
That's mighty
brave talk, Shanghai,

1015
01:00:53,116 --> 01:00:54,947
with 20 men behind you.

1016
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:57,782
Let's you and me step out
into the street, alone.

1017
01:00:57,821 --> 01:01:00,915
Oh, no, you don't sucker me
into that!

1018
01:01:00,957 --> 01:01:04,017
Can't bluff
your way out, huh?

1019
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:06,494
All right, boys,
take this skunk.

1020
01:01:12,769 --> 01:01:14,361
You gentlemen
made such a racket,

1021
01:01:14,437 --> 01:01:16,268
Frank Loving
was too scared to deal.

1022
01:01:16,306 --> 01:01:17,773
You busted my winning streak.

1023
01:01:19,309 --> 01:01:20,640
Fun's over, boys.

1024
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:21,803
Unbuckle 'em.

1025
01:01:21,845 --> 01:01:23,312
Let's shoot it out.

1026
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:24,813
All right, Shanghai?

1027
01:01:24,848 --> 01:01:26,748
Go ahead, draw, all of you.

1028
01:01:26,783 --> 01:01:29,047
But you get it first, Shanghai.

1029
01:01:29,085 --> 01:01:30,575
And you second, Ringo.

1030
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:32,417
Well, call the play.

1031
01:01:32,455 --> 01:01:36,653
I'll give you five seconds
to unbuckle your guns.

1032
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:38,160
One.

1033
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:41,226
Two.

1034
01:01:42,765 --> 01:01:44,630
Three.

1035
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:46,035
Four.

1036
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:47,935
We had enough fun, boys.

1037
01:01:48,004 --> 01:01:49,938
Unbuckle 'em.

1038
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:51,836
Harry, Jackson,
get the hardware.

1039
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:53,706
Get moving.

1040
01:01:53,743 --> 01:01:54,732
Doc!

1041
01:01:58,748 --> 01:02:00,648
Anybody else
want to try their luck?

1042
01:02:01,851 --> 01:02:02,749
Get moving.

1043
01:02:02,785 --> 01:02:04,013
Come on, keep moving!

1044
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:05,020
All of you!

1045
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:07,113
All right, Doc, we
ain't finished yet.

1046
01:02:07,156 --> 01:02:08,817
You would have been,

1047
01:02:08,925 --> 01:02:11,189
but I feel in a charitable mood tonight.
