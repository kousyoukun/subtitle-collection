Hello, Ed.

42
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,580
Where's Doc Holliday?

43
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,150
Over at the hotel,
more than likely.

44
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,450
He's been
expecting you...

45
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:52,290
Get word over there
I’m waiting for him.

46
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:53,290
No need to do that, Ed.

47
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:55,630
The whole town knows
you're waiting for him by now.

48
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,100
Before there's
another killing...

49
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,100
You just go on serving
your watered-down liquor

50
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,690
and keep out
of my business, Shanssey.

51
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:02,460
stinking drunk,

52
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,470
spoiling for a fight.

53
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,490
Whiskey!

54
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,600
He drew a gun
on Holliday.

55
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,630
Over there!

56
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,740
Have it your way, Ed.

57
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,080
Check your guns,
if you want to stay here.

58
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:30,320
Leave the bottle!

59
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,630
You don't stand a chance, Doc.

60
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:39,000
Bailey brought two men with him.

61
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,340
Oh, come on, honey,

62
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,370
let's cut out of here
while there's still time.

63
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,930
The whole town, including
that no-good marshal,

64
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,040
is laying for you.

65
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:52,040
Right or wrong, they're going
to hang you for another killing.

66
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,080
You know it.

67
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:55,850
Doc.

68
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,980
Oh, you ain't even
listening to me.

69
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:03,320
Now, Kate, Mr. Bailey
came all the way from Fort Worth

70
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,390
to see me
on a gentleman's matter.

71
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,490
''Gentleman.''

72
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:07,560
It wouldn't be hospitable

73
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,190
for me to leave town,
now, would it?

74
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,100
Don't start that gentleman
business with me again.

75
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:15,270
Well, it's a pure case
of ethics, but...

76
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,040
Well, that's something

77
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,840
a person like you
wouldn't understand.

78
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:23,510
Why do you always have
to treat me like I’m dirt?

79
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,540
You ain't no better than me!

80
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:26,640
That's debatable.

81
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,740
Oh, is it?

82
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,450
You and that
magnolia drippin'.

83
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,550
Well, let me tell you
something, Doc Holliday.

84
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,650
All them fancy clothes
and that smart talk

85
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,060
don't make you no gentleman!

86
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,530
You are dirt, just like me.

87
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:42,400
And I’m tired of hearing
about that...

88
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,630
Georgia plantation

89
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:46,160
and all them lily-white
friends of yours.

90
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:47,540
They're all gone now!

91
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:49,100
They're all gone!

92
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,100
Yes, they are...

93
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,120
and here I am with you.

94
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:59,380
Your family scraped the barrel
after the war wiped them out

95
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,820
just to send you
through dental school.

96
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,750
You sure turned out fine.

97
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:07,660
They'd be real proud of you.

98
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:13,560
Ow!

99
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,400
Don't you ever mention
my family again.

100
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,060
Doc, please...

101
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:25,940
Doc, please.

102
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,870
Forget about Bailey.

103
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,820
Let's get out of here
while there's still time.

104
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,220
Maybe...

105
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,750
Maybe we could
even go to Laredo

106
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:38,820
like you... you said

107
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,660
and do something about
that cough of yours.

108
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,960
It's getting worse all the time.

109
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,830
Your concern over my health
touches me deeply.

110
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,990
You know how
I feel about you.

111
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,870
I know exactly how you feel.

112
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,040
I don't know...

113
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,630
I don't know what I'd do

114
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,870
if anything
happened to you.

115
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:00,180
You'd lose your meal ticket,
wouldn't you?

116
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,110
That ain't nice
to say to me, Doc.

117
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:06,750
I’ve been good
to you, ain't I?

118
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:09,310
Why don't you think
about me once in a while?

119
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,030
All right, get over
to Shanssey's

120
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,460
and tell him
I’ll be there later.

121
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,860
Please, don't go there.

122
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:19,920
Do as I tell you.

123
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,040
I need some money.

124
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,660
Hello, Wyatt.

125
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,540
Cotton Wilson.

126
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,170
It’s been a long time.

127
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,480
Man, I’m plain worn out.

128
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,520
Hope you got some
good news for me.

129
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,150
Ike Clanton rode through here
three days ago, heading east.

130
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,160
Waco, I think.

131
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,160
Johnny Ringo was with him.

132
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,290
Rode through, heading east?

133
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,490
You didn't get my telegram.

134
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:57,520
I got it.

135
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,990
Well, why didn't you
hold him?

136
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,970
I had no quarrel
with Ike Clanton.

137
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,370
Nothing to hold him for.

138
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,570
Nothing to hold him for?

139
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,600
Why, man, he's got a dozen
charges against him.

140
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:14,140
I played this whole thing
so he'd be forced into Griffin.

141
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,740
I figured if there was one man
in Texas who could stop him,

142
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,220
you'd be the man.

143
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,980
Now, don't go getting your blood
heated up, Wyatt.

144
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,550
Cotton, it's Wyatt Earp
you're talking to.

145
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:28,030
Ten years ago, I watched
you walk single-handed

146
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,620
into a saloon
in Oklahoma City,

147
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,720
and knock out three of the
fastest guns in the territory.

148
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:35,560
Ten years
is a long time ago.

149
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,260
Getting old, I guess.

150
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,610
Anybody ever told me that
Cotton Wilson had gone yellow,

151
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:47,980
I would have called
them a liar.

152
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:49,810
You have no right
to say that to me, Wyatt.

153
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:52,280
I’ve bucked heads with the
toughest gangs on the frontier.

154
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,120
Then why didn't you
stop Ringo and Clanton?

155
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,490
Well, why didn't you?!

156
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,480
If you can't handle it anymore,
turn in your badge!

157
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,190
Turn in my badge.

158
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,360
I’ve been a lawman for 25 years.

159
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,840
Worked every hellhole
in the territory.

160
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,870
You know what I got
to show for it?

161
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:18,470
A $1 2-a-month room in the back
of a cruddy boardinghouse,

162
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,500
and a tin star.

163
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,610
Think I like winding up
in a place like this?

164
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:25,680
It’s the end of the line
for me, Wyatt.

165
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,690
It'll happen to you someday.

166
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,480
Just like it happens
to all of us.

167
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:44,690
Where is that
yellow-livered skunk?

168
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:45,830
Slow down, Ed.

169
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,600
Holliday's only
trying to rile you.

170
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,970
What do you figure's
keeping Holliday?

171
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:52,950
Doc's going to make 'em
dangle a little.

172
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:57,920
Wyatt Earp.

173
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:58,920
Why, you old son of a gun.

174
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,110
Why didn't you let us know
you was riding into town?

175
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,380
Good to see you, John.

176
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,750
Hi, Marshal.

177
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,020
Come on, sit down.

178
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,190
Cigar?

179
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,300
I’ll be a son of a gun.

180
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:14,030
You've sure come a long ways

181
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,500
since the railroading
days in Cheyenne.

182
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,030
Ellsworth, Wichita,
now Dodge City.

183
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:20,970
Funny, I never figured
you for a lawman.

184
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,940
You was always
pretty reckless and wild.

185
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,840
Never figured myself
for a lawman, either.

186
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,180
Fix a nice steak
for Mr. Earp.

187
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:27,180
Yes, sir.

188
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:28,840
My personal stock.

189
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,080
How are the brothers?

190
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,810
Fine. Virgil and
Morgan are married.

191
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:32,940
Virgil and Morgan married?

192
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:33,850
What do you know.

193
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:36,290
John, I need some help.

194
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,690
Anything I can do for you.

195
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,190
Ike Clanton and Johnny Ringo

196
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,960
rode through here
three days ago.

197
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,590
They got a dozen counts
against them.

198
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:44,120
I telegraphed Cotton
to hold them,

199
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,130
but he crossed me up.

200
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:47,160
Cotton's skidded a long way.

201
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,360
You know anything?

202
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,130
Wish I did, but...

203
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:51,500
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

204
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,200
Doc Holliday played poker
with them.

205
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,400
Maybe he heard something.

206
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,700
Bartender!

207
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:58,040
Bartender!

208
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,240
whiskey around here!

209
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,610
Ed Bailey.

210
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,450
Doc Holliday
killed his brother.

211
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:06,650
The guy was begging for it.

212
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,310
He came in drunk,
cheated at cards.

213
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,650
He pulled a gun on Doc.

214
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:10,820
Did you ever
meet Holliday?

215
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:12,790
We crossed trails once.

216
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,020
He was a dentist then.

217
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,430
You know, I’ve yet
to see the guy pick a fight.

218
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,620
Trouble just naturally
seems to find him.

219
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:21,660
It’s gotten so every would-be
gunman on the frontier

220
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,330
wants the honor of
putting him in Boot Hill.

221
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:27,770
You know how it is when
a man gets a reputation.

222
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,330
I sure do.

223
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,600
Where is Holliday?

224
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,170
I better get to him
while the getting's good.

225
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,240
He's at the hotel.

226
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,040
Keep that steak warm,
I’ll be back.

227
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,410
You ain't missing much;
it's longhorn.

228
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:09,640
Holliday.

229
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,950
Sit down, make
yourself at home,

230
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:15,180
just like you were invited.

231
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,650
I don't know if you
remember me...

232
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,920
I remember you--
Wyatt Earp.

233
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,520
Pulled a tooth for you
ten years ago.

234
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,320
If I knew
when I had you in the chair

235
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,090
what you were going to turn out
to be, I...

236
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:27,760
I hear you've taken up
a new occupation.

237
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,560
It’s too bad;
you were a good dentist.

238
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,540
My patients didn't
like my coughing.

239
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,770
I’d like some information.

240
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:40,040
The name of this game
is solitaire.

241
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,520
I’m in a position to do
a little horse trading.

242
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,680
Good evening,
Mr. Earp.

243
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,410
I know something
that would interest you.

244
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,420
You don't know a thing
that would interest me.

245
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:57,460
Suppose I was to tell you
that Ed Bailey...

246
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,690
has a small derringer
hidden in his boot.

247
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:00,860
Left or right?

248
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,270
Left.

249
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,400
I’d say that was
good information--

250
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,770
Bailey's left-handed.

251
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:06,970
Ike Clanton and Johnny Ringo

252
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,410
rode through here
three days ago.

253
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,600
You played cards with them.

254
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,870
Which way were they heading?

255
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:11,900
Beats me.

256
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,310
I thought we were
making a deal.

257
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,310
That's what you said.

258
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,470
I didn't make any deals.

259
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,280
But you know where
they went, don't you?

260
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,480
Look, you're
interrupting my game.

261
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:38,440
You've got a real big hate
for the law, haven't you?

262
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:40,600
Is there any reason
why I shouldn't?

263
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,770
Your brother, Morgan,

264
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,470
ran me out
of Deadwood last year

265
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:46,040
and impounded $1 0,000
of my money.

266
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,240
As a matter of fact,
you've got brothers

267
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,880
marshaling all over
the frontier, haven't you?

268
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,020
I’ll see you again,
Holliday.

269
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,580
If you're around.

270
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,900
What did you find out?

271
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,300
Not a thing.

272
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,000
It’s my hunch they're
headed for Tombstone.

273
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,200
Ike's old man has
a big ranch there.

274
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,640
But I can't be sure.

275
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,980
Isn't your brother Virgil
a marshal at Tombstone?

276
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,540
That's right.

277
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,350
I sent him a telegram,
asking him to be

278
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,110
on the lookout for him,
just in case.

279
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,250
What are you going to do?

280
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,480
There's nothing I can do.

281
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,820
The trail's ice cold.

282
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,920
I’m heading back for Dodge City
in the morning.

283
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,300
Mr. Holliday.

284
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:14,460
Yes.

285
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,100
Would you care to settle up
your bill now?

286
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,330
Well, uh...

287
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:19,630
What I mean, sir, is

288
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:22,640
we didn't know whether you
were checking out or not.

289
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:25,110
You'll have word
in 1 5 minutes.

290
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:59,410
Doc, you're walking
into a stacked deck.

291
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,350
If Bailey don't get you,
the marshal will.

292
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,980
You'd be smart to get out
while you can.

293
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:08,650
You act as if you want
to get killed.

294
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:15,020
Maybe I do.

295
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,760
Holliday...

296
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,430
let's check your gun.

297
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:41,050
Good evening, Harry.

298
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:42,650
The usual.

299
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,160
Yes, sir.

300
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:49,450
I understand
there's a gentleman

301
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,830
in from Fort Worth
to see me.

302
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:55,360
This gentleman should have
taught his brother better

303
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,770
than to deal
with a marked deck.

304
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,030
Well, if you happen to see
this, uh... gentleman,

305
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:05,100
tell him I’ll be waiting
for him at Boot Hill.

306
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:07,610
He'll have only one direction
to travel from there--

307
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:08,640
down.

308
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:15,480
Come to think of it...

309
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,150
he's no gentleman at all.

310
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:19,350
He's a son
of a yellow-bellied sow.

311
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:35,440
All right, Doc, let's go.

312
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,170
Right on cue.

313
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:39,910
What's the charge?

314
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,240
We'll think of one.

315
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,220
I’m sure you will.

316
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,620
Thanks, Harry.

317
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:53,980
All right, get him
out of here.

318
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:54,990
It’s all over, folks.

319
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,000
Break it up.

320
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:57,260
Come on, step up to the bar.

321
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,660
Free drinks, on the house.

322
00:18:58,730 --> 00:18:59,930
Come on, give me
some beer, bartender.

323
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,530
Ah, it's always a mess
after a killing.

324
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:06,600
Looks like Doc spoiled
everybody's fun.

325
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,700
He's crazy, but he's
got nerve, though--

326
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,140
plenty of nerve.

327
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,510
Shanssey, Mr. Earp, what are you
going to about this?

328
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:13,600
You saw what happened.

329
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,340
They had no right
to take Doc off.

330
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,440
They're going to do something
to him, I know it.

331
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,450
Kate Fisher,
friend of Doc's.

332
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,710
He's going to be framed.

333
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,240
You saw it--
Bailey pulled a gun on him.

334
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:22,780
Wait a minute, Miss Fisher,
take it easy.

335
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,850
Why don't you just relax
and let the law handle this.

336
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:26,220
There ain't no law
in this town.

337
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,420
I never saw a man beg more
to get his brains blown out.

338
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,720
Please, you've got
to help him.

339
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,920
Doc Holliday's none
of my business.

340
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,060
Please, Mr. Earp.

341
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,430
I don't want
any part of him.

342
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:34,430
I don't even like him.

343
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:35,430
I’m sorry.

344
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,460
Good night.

345
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,810
Kate, I can have a
pair of saddle horses

346
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,540
put round back
of the hotel.

347
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,940
That's as much as I can do.

348
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,470
With the feeling
against Doc,

349
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,540
I wouldn't stay in
business ten minutes

350
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,070
if they knew
I’d helped him.

351
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,190
Ten, please.

352
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,400
Wilson live here?

353
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,840
Why, no, sir.

354
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,610
They're just holding
Doc Holliday

355
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:20,810
upstairs in his room.

356
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,140
Oh.

357
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,660
Mr. Earp.

358
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:09,660
Look, Miss Fisher, I told you
this is none of my business.

359
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,200
I don't care what you
think of me and Doc.

360
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,860
There's a lynch mob
starting across the street.

361
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,560
That's your business,
ain't it?

362
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,600
Don't make no difference
whether Doc is right or wrong.

363
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,300
He don't deserve to be hung
by a pack of animals.

364
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:21,020
You're getting out of here.

365
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,160
Since when have you taken

366
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,670
to rescuing gamblers
in distress?

367
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,470
Don't take it personal, Doc.

368
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,410
I just don't like lynchings.

369
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,910
What are we waiting for?

370
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,100
Not yet.

371
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:44,890
I’d say now is
a very good time.

372
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:08,410
Hey, Sturges' barn!

373
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,530
That's it.

374
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,930
Get going down
the back stairs.

375
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,700
Much obliged, Marshal.

376
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,540
I’ll see you in Dodge City
and thank you properly.

377
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:37,980
You can thank me properly
by staying out of Dodge City.

378
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:41,280
More water!

00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,020
How about that?

406
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,820
A little out of place
for Dodge City,

407
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:34,990
wouldn't you say?

408
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:36,550
That's strictly
big-city stuff.

409
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,560
Looks like she's going
to stay a while.

410
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,620
Got a trunk.

411
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:46,170
I got to go on a posse.

412
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:48,230
That's what I came
to see you about.

413
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:49,830
Chief Dullknife is
on a rampage again.

414
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,640
I’m going to have
to borrow your deputies.

415
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,200
You're always short of men.

416
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,310
Who's the girl?

417
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:56,320
Yeah, who's the girl?

418
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,340
Girl? What girl?

419
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,810
Oh. I was too busy finding out

420
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:07,020
that Doc Holliday and his
lady friend have just checked in

421
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,080
at the Dodge House.

422
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:09,620
Doc Holliday?

423
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,630
I told him to keep out
of Dodge City.

424
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,630
I’d better get over there
before he unpacks.

425
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:15,290
You going to lend me
your deputies?

426
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:16,300
Well, all right,

427
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,960
but I have to keep
Charlie here with me.

428
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,400
You can have the
rest of the boys.

429
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,630
And don't forget to get back
before those cattle drives.

430
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:24,140
You know how business picks up
when the cowpokes hit town.

431
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:34,850
Mario, go on out
and get some fresh air.

432
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,350
The mayor's
welcoming committee, eh?

433
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:41,990
I thought I told you
to stay out of Dodge City.

434
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:44,620
I like a sharp razor,
don't you?

435
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,260
Care for a shave?

436
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:51,860
There's a stage for Abilene
in the morning.

437
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,670
I want you to be on it.

438
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:54,870
Can't.

439
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:57,600
The marshal of Abilene
sent me here.

440
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,080
As a matter of fact,

441
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:01,010
I wish someone would write
you fellas a new speech.

442
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:03,570
I’ve had the same one
in the last five towns.

443
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,610
All right, you'll stay
in your hotel room, then,

444
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:07,050
till day after tomorrow.

445
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:09,110
I’ll personally escort you
to the westbound train.

446
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:12,090
Wyatt, you've got
to face a hard fact.

447
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,560
I’m in a state of complete
financial collapse.

448
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:18,620
I don't even have
the price of a ticket.

449
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,600
Shanssey told me you had
quite a bankroll

450
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:21,620
back there in Griffin.

451
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:23,170
Shanssey ought to know.

452
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,330
He had $1 0,000 of mine
in his safe.

453
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:27,030
You know what that
son of a gun did?

454
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:29,400
You'll recall I had to leave
town rather hastily.

455
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,410
Those two horses in
back of the hotel

456
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,140
cost me $5,000 apiece.

457
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,650
Now, how about that?

458
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:35,810
Towel, please.

459
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:39,080
Oh, thank you.

460
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:42,510
Everyone puts such
an outlandish value

461
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,490
on my life.

462
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:48,790
Say, Wyatt...

463
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:50,130
how much do you earn?

464
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,260
About $1 00 a month
and two dollars an arrest?

465
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,490
You trying to bribe me?

466
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:55,500
Oh, no.

467
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:57,060
Not you.

468
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:00,330
I feel compelled to offer you
an honest business proposition.

469
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,370
That's not bad.

470
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:04,500
You got any money saved?

471
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:06,010
Some.

472
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:08,510
Going to buy a small ranch
or a country store someday, huh?

473
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:10,280
Well, I’ll make it easier
for you.

474
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,340
You stake me
to a thousand dollars

475
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:14,080
and I’ll split my winnings.

476
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,550
The cowboys are coming
and the stakes will be big.

477
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:18,080
Fifty-fifty, huh?

478
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,890
Now actually,
any number of people

479
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:22,520
would be glad to back me
for ten percent, but...

480
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,460
I like you, Wyatt Earp.

481
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,800
I like your cut.

482
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,730
Why so generous
with the split?

483
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:30,170
Look, a barber needs this.

484
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,900
You're a lawman,
you need a gun.

485
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:35,270
Money's just a tool
of my trade.

486
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:37,740
Of course, you will
guarantee you won't lose.

487
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,400
I never lose.

488
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:42,070
You see, poker's played
by desperate men

489
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,170
who cherish money.

490
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,980
I don't lose because
I have nothing to lose,

491
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,010
including my life.

492
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:47,080
Is it a deal?

493
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:50,280
Of all the low-down gall.

494
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,050
Ah, well...

495
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:54,060
You're just going
to have to stake me

496
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:55,360
to a railroad ticket.

497
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,230
Holliday, I’ve done

498
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:06,760
some foolish things
in my life.

499
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:08,860
I’m about to do another.

500
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,470
I’m going to let you
stay in town.

501
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,610
Why so generous?

502
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,620
Let's say I like your cut.

503
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:20,380
You can stay and you can play
on one condition:

504
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:22,440
No knives, no guns
and no killings.

505
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:27,820
No knives, no guns, no killings.

506
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,920
That's it.

507
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,620
You have my word
as a gentleman.

508
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:34,560
Just one more thing.

509
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,930
You ought to treat that woman
decent or leave her.

510
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:38,630
Kate?

511
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,970
Yes, poor old Kate.

512
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:43,130
She stands for everything I hate
in Doc Holliday.

513
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,510
Oh, leave two bits
for the barber, will you?

514
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:55,580
Well, I found out all
about your lady fair.

515
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,990
Hey, where'd you
get the new gun?

516
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,280
Buntline made it
for me special.

517
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,290
What lady fair?

518
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:00,190
It’s sure beautiful--

519
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,280
isn't that barrel too long?

520
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:02,450
No, good balance,
just right.

521
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:03,460
What's beautiful?

522
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,460
Hand-tooled, too, huh?

523
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,660
What are you talking about?

524
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,890
Well, that girl that came in

525
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,420
on the stage
day before yesterday.

526
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:09,990
Oh, yeah, I remember;
what about her?

527
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,870
Well, she's staying
over at Mrs. D's place.

528
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,370
They tell me
she's got a trunkful

529
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:15,400
of the most elegant clothes
you've ever seen.

530
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,570
Some of them dresses
clean from Paris, France.

531
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:19,510
She's five-foot six,

532
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:21,170
weighs 1 20 pounds,

533
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:22,180
red hair, green eyes...

534
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:23,440
What is she doing here?

535
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,470
Gambler.

536
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:27,040
Very funny.

537
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,090
Well, if you
think that's funny,

538
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,450
why don't you take
a little walk

539
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:34,220
over to the
Longbranch Saloon.

540
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,490
You'll die laughing.

541
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,130
Hello, Wyatt.

542
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,310
What's the trouble?

543
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:57,470
I think I’m going to have
to break up that game.

544
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,480
Can't do that, Wyatt.

545
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,040
There's no law against
women gambling.

546
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:02,280
I know, but every time
there's a woman at the tables,

547
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,650
there's trouble, you know that.

548
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:08,090
Sorry, game's over.

549
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:10,100
Wyatt, this is Laura Denbow.

550
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:11,760
Kelly, you're the mayor
of this town.

551
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,820
We agreed there'd be

552
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:14,390
no women gambling
on the north side.

553
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:16,260
Miss Denbow's marker
is respected

554
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,170
for $1 0,000 anywhere
in the West.

555
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,670
We all consider her
an exception.

556
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,540
Not in Dodge City,
she isn't.

557
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:24,630
So you're the famous Wyatt Earp.

558
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,300
Lawman, judge and jury.

559
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:28,470
That's right, Miss Gambler--
start with you

560
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:31,310
and we'll have every tramp
on the south side over here.

561
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:32,610
Who's a tramp?

562
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:34,380
Shut up and keep
out of this, cowboy.

563
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:36,050
You're talking to a lady!

564
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:38,220
It appears the marshal
hasn't met a lady before.

565
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,020
You're in a saloon,
playing a man's game.

566
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,650
Why should you be
treated like a lady?

567
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:43,460
And you ain't no gentleman.

568
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:46,360
That's all for tonight,
Miss Denbow.

569
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,960
Take your hands off her.

570
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,330
Hold it, Charlie.

571
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,250
I’m tired of you
pushing people around.

572
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,250
Now, go for your gun.

573
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,650
I’m going to kill you!

574
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,770
I don't have a gun, cowboy.

575
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,980
I’m unarmed.

576
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:16,090
Stay where you are!

577
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:17,190
You're drunk.

578
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:18,790
You don't know
what you're doing.

579
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:22,570
Now, give me that gun before
you get into real trouble.

580
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:28,870
I don't stand
for nobody talking

581
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:30,500
like that to no lady.

582
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,110
You stand real still.

583
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,770
And just give me that gun.

584
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:02,510
I ain't no gunman.

585
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:06,440
I couldn't kill anybody.

586
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,470
I know that, cowboy.

587
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,880
You were just trying
to impress the lady.

588
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,040
Charlie--

589
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:15,750
take him down
and sober him up

590
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:17,190
and get him out of town.

591
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:21,630
You're under arrest.

592
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,920
For what, Mr. Earp?

593
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,830
You just saw it--
disturbing the peace.

594
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,920
Wait a minute, Wyatt.

595
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,450
It’s all right, Mayor Kelly.

596
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,760
The marshal's only
trying to save

597
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,770
the good name of Dodge City.

598
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,140
Besides, I might like
to see the inside of a jail.

599
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,610
Don't you think you better wait
for a few of your deputies?

600
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,740
I might be desperate.

601
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:02,030
I’ll let you go,
if you promise

602
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:03,800
to do your gambling
south of the deadline.

603
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,030
South of the deadline?

604
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:09,070
No, I think I’ll stay.

605
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:11,670
Perhaps the judge isn't as
righteous as the marshal.

606
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:16,210
Well, aren't you going
to open the door?

607
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,850
Oh, l, uh...

608
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:28,590
won't be needing these
while I’m here.

609
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,990
Why don't you buy
yourself a new halo?

610
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,590
The one you're wearing's
too tight.

611
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,540
Close the door, Marshal.

612
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,150
Locked her up?

613
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:59,020
That's right,
disturbing the peace.

614
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:00,650
I could get her out.

615
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:03,820
$500 says you can't.

616
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,660
Make it the $1 ,000
I owe you.

617
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,700
Double or nothing.

618
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:11,630
It’s a bet.

619
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:17,770
I’ll be back in 30 minutes.

620
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:33,160
Good evening, Charlie.

621
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,220
Oh, hiya, Doc.

622
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:39,330
Man, this 1 2 on and 1 2 off
is sure ruining my homework.

623
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,770
I spend half my life
on that dern paperwork.

624
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:51,780
Care for a nip?

625
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:54,210
Doc, you know why I don't
like drinking on duty.

626
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:58,350
What's the occasion?

627
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,350
I’d like to bail out
Miss Denbow.

628
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:02,180
Hit me.

629
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,110
I got 1 9.

630
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,150
Twenty.

631
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,620
Can't do it, Doc.

632
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,320
She's got to appear
in court tomorrow.

633
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,270
Think I’ll stand on these.

634
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:22,300
Twenty-one.

635
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,740
Oh, I’ll wait for Wyatt.

636
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,640
I sure hope Bat gets
back with our deputies

637
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,210
before them cowboys
hit town.

638
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,940
Blackjack.

639
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:36,280
I got one, too.

640
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,430
You know, Doc, if we
was playing for real,

641
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:49,900
I’d just be compelled
to have a look at that deck.

642
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:52,200
Oh, I’d be compelled
to ask you to try it.

643
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:54,860
Use mine, huh?

644
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:58,500
Good thing Wyatt
don't let us

645
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:59,840
go around drawing
these things.

646
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,900
Somebody might get hurt.

647
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:05,440
Well... I got
to go have a look

648
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,320
at the prisoners and horses.

649
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,980
Watch the office for me,
will you, Doc?

650
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,180
Sure thing, Charlie.

651
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:29,600
I never could get the hang
of these things.

652
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,370
What are you doing here?

653
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:33,340
Wyatt, I’d like to
bail out Miss Denbow.

654
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,070
She happens to be a lady.

655
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:38,740
No favors, Holliday.

656
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:39,880
Let's say you release her

657
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,390
in exchange for
some information.

658
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:46,510
You don't know a thing
that would interest me.

659
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,460
Uh, suppose l
were to tell you

660
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:51,620
that Shanghai Pierce is
bringing his herd here.

661
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,430
Shanghai Pierce, huh?

662
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:56,660
I take it you've had
some run-ins with him.

663
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,300
I had to bat him over the head

664
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:02,030
once or twice, when he got drunk
and tried to shoot up Wichita.

665
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:03,840
Not a bad guy,
just forgot to grow up.

666
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,840
Well, he's aiming
to shoot up Dodge City,

667
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,710
and he's hired Ringo to make
sure you don't spoil his fun.

668
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:11,610
Oh, and what's more, he, uh...

669
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:15,620
He's put a price of $1 ,000
on your head, dead.

670
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:17,550
What else is new?

671
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:19,850
Well, l, I thought
it was kind of amusing,

672
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:21,360
a price on a lawman's head.

673
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:24,120
Look, Holliday,

674
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,320
as long as I’m the law here,

675
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,520
not one of those cowpokes

676
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,800
is going to cross
that deadline with a gun.

677
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:31,360
I don't care if his name
is Shanghai Pierce.

678
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,530
Well spoken.

679
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:35,440
I’ll repeat those words
at your funeral.

680
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,440
How about releasing
Miss Denbow?

681
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,140
Nothing doing.

682
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:44,810
Look, you made a deal.

683
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:45,940
You made the deal.

684
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,540
I didn't agree to
a thing, remember?

685
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:52,450
Charlie, you're working
for a crook.

686
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:53,460
Oh, yeah?

687
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:54,650
Go on home, Charlie,
and turn in.

688
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:55,790
I’ll finish these reports.

689
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:57,490
Thanks.
Everything's quiet.

690
00:38:57,530 --> 00:38:58,500
Good night.

691
00:38:58,530 --> 00:38:59,760
G'night.

692
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,860
Wyatt, you ought
to turn her loose.

693
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:05,170
She's got no business
behind bars.

694
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:09,640
I think Charlie's right.

695
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,140
Let her out.

696
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:21,010
Conscience?

697
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:22,250
Maybe I like her.

698
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:23,380
Tell Kelly

699
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,950
she's to play
in the side room.

700
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:27,190
I don't want her gambling
on the main floor.

701
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:29,720
Good evening, Miss Denbow.

702
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,750
Good evening.

703
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,130
Come on, Laura, we've got
business to take care of.

704
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:36,160
Thank you.

705
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,330
Marshal.

706
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:53,840
Good evening, Mr. Earp.

707
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:56,450
Good evening, Miss Denbow.

708
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:57,820
Good evening, Mr. Earp.

709
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,590
Pair of deuces.

710
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:09,260
I’ll check to the lady.

711
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,270
Fifty.

712
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,270
I’ll stay.

713
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,290
Too steep for me.

714
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:14,330
I’m in.

715
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,960
$50, and I’ll
make it $50 more.

716
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:16,970
I’m in for the $50.

717
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:17,980
Deal.

718
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:18,980
Doc...

719
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:19,980
Queen of clubs.

720
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:20,980
It’s almost morning.

721
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:23,070
Jack of spades, three tens.

722
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:24,640
You didn't answer me.

723
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,670
I’ll make it $1 00.

724
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,680
Doc!

725
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,850
Go buy yourself a drink.

726
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:30,220
And I’ll raise you $1 00.

727
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,240
Too much for me.

728
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:33,280
$200 to me.

729
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:34,290
I’ll call you.

730
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:35,950
I’ll go along with the lady.

731
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:37,890
Four deuces.

732
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:39,290
Gentlemen, we've been
out-classed.

733
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:40,630
Thank you, gentlemen.

734
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:41,860
I think I’ll call it a night.

735
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:42,990
Will you cash me in, Frank?

736
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:44,000
Good night.

737
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:44,690
Good night, Mayor Kelly.

738
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,700
May I see you home?

739
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,700
No, thank you, Doc.

740
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:47,700
Good night.

741
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:48,900
Good night.

742
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,370
How about a little draw, boys?

743
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:51,430
All right.

744
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,100
I’ll get my ante in there.

745
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:55,130
Good night.

746
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:15,620
Johnny, I need Luke Short.

747
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:16,930
Richie Bell
and two of his boys

748
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:18,130
held up the bank at Salina.

749
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:19,500
They killed the cashier.

750
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:20,560
They're heading this way.

751
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:21,800
I sent Luke to Abilene, Wyatt.

752
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,470
I’m sorry.

753
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:24,910
How soon do you
have to pull out?

754
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:28,940
Right away, if I expect
to pick up their trail.

755
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,610
Doggone it, Luke's
the only one in town

756
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:31,620
who can handle a gun.

757
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:33,680
What about Charlie Bassett?

758
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,240
Somebody's got to mind the town.

759
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:36,450
Want a gunhand?

760
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,180
You?

761
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,980
I do handle one pretty well.

762
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:44,050
The only trouble is

763
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:46,120
those best able
to testify to my aim

764
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,650
aren't around for comment.

765
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,530
I’ll take care of it alone.

766
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:50,830
Suit yourself.

767
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:04,470
Hold up your right hand.

768
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,510
Do you solemnly
swear to uphold...

769
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:07,520
Oh, this is ridiculous!

770
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:08,520
You're deputized.

771
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:10,040
Grab some gear,
I’ll get the horses.

772
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:12,220
Now, wait a minute, don't
I get to wear a tin star?

773
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:13,450
Not on your life!

774
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:08,010
Medicine.

775
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:17,560
For a smart gambler, you
sure play sucker odds.

776
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:19,850
You're going to be dead
inside of a year.

777
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:22,160
What do you know
about odds, preacher?

778
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:24,130
This kind of cough
doesn't go away.

779
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,150
Why don't you get out of
those stinking saloons?

780
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,790
Pack up and go live
in the mountains.

781
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:29,390
Not me.

782
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:31,600
You're just ornery enough
to live to a ripe old age.

783
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:34,230
No, I’m not going to let it
drain me out slow.

784
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:37,610
Sure.

785
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,670
Play it hard and fast.

786
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:40,680
Listen, Wyatt,

787
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:42,270
the only thing
I’m really scared of

788
00:43:42,310 --> 00:43:43,340
is dying in bed.

789
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:45,680
I don't want to go
little by little.

790
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:47,680
Someday, somebody's
got to out-shoot me,

791
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,410
and it'll be
over with real quick.

792
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:54,230
Earp, I didn't come along
to hear you preach a sermon.

793
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:57,660
You know, I’ve been wondering
about that.

794
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:02,560
Why did you come?

795
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,430
Well, if I stick around
long enough,

796
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:07,340
sooner or later you've gotto put your head in a noose.

797
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:08,500
I’m going to bail you out.

798
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:11,640
I’ve only got one debt
in this world,

799
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,230
and I don't like
owing it to you.

800
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,270
You don't owe me a thing.

801
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:16,840
I’ve never needed
anybody in my life,

802
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,350
and I sure don't need
Doc Holliday.

803
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:20,250
You're pretty positive
about that.

804
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:21,480
As far as I’m concerned,

805
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,380
you can get on your horse
and keep riding.

806
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,410
No, thanks.

807
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:28,520
I think I’ll stay.

808
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:36,570
You know, Wyatt, you and l
are pretty much alike, actually.

809
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,190
Both of us live with a gun.

810
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,260
The only differenceis that badge.

811
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:42,430
What's the matter,
preacher?

812
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:43,870
Don't you like
being preached at?

813
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:45,340
Shut up and go to sleep.

814
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:04,020
Richie Bell won't
be robbing any more banks.

815
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:05,320
I thought you were asleep.

816
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:08,320
No, it figured.

817
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:09,790
Let's head back to Dodge.

818
00:46:09,830 --> 00:46:11,160
I want to get in a bed.

819
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,320
What for?

820
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,560
They're not going any place.

821
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,590
Neither are we.

822
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:15,860
I’m getting some sleep.

823
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:23,040
Get out of those
stinking saloons.

824
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:27,770
Pack up, live
in the mountains.

825
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:38,990
Charlie.

826
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:40,250
Hi.

827
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:42,490
I’ll go in and fix up
a coroner's report.

828
00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:44,150
Thanks a lot, Doc.

829
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,220
You and I are even.

830
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:47,460
Not yet.

831
00:46:48,770 --> 00:46:51,030
Not until the debt's
paid in full, Marshal.

832
00:46:56,170 --> 00:46:58,840
I hear you did some
pretty fancy shooting, Doc.

833
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,340
Well, it's...

834
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:02,900
all in a day's work
for a deputy.

835
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:06,280
You all right?

836
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:11,420
Find Kate and tell her

837
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:13,360
to come up to the hotel
right away, will you?

838
00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:15,290
Kate hasn't been around
for a while, Doc.

839
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:16,950
What do you mean?

840
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,430
I mean nobody's seen her
on this side of town

841
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:21,260
since you rode out.

842
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,470
Should I get a doctor?

843
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,300
Good morning, Laura.

844
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:04,500
Well, I never thought
I’d be glad to see you.

845
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:05,600
Something wrong?

846
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,270
My horse has gone lame.

847
00:48:07,310 --> 00:48:08,300
Right forefoot.

848
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:18,980
Hoof's split.

849
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:20,320
Better not ride him in.

850
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:21,620
Aw...

851
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:23,750
Leave him here,
he won't go far.

852
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,490
I’ll send
the blacksmith out.

853
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:27,120
Nice you
happened along.

854
00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:30,590
I didn't happen along.

855
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:34,200
I know you ride out
this way every day.

856
00:48:37,110 --> 00:48:38,870
Come on, I’ll give you
a ride into town.

857
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:47,480
Unless you'd rather
walk six miles.

858
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:01,090
Better hold on tight.

859
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:05,690
Tighter.

860
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:40,570
Doc, what are you doing up
this time of day?

861
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:42,070
It’s only 3:00.

862
00:49:42,110 --> 00:49:43,770
I’m on a health bender.

863
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:46,400
Up before noon,
take a 20-yard walk.

864
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:52,880
What's the action here?

865
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:57,250
Uh, picking up the hardware
as soon as the cowboys hit town.

866
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,960
Sure don't look like
Bat's going to get back

867
00:50:00,990 --> 00:50:02,550
with our deputies soon enough.

868
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:03,750
Where's Kate?

869
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:09,370
Where is she, Charlie?

870
00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:13,660
Well, it's...
kind of touchy, Doc.

871
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:15,970
I... I...

872
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:17,100
Yes?

873
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:22,770
You promised Wyatt

874
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:24,540
there wouldn't be
any gunplay, Doc.

875
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:25,550
Now, you can't...

876
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:26,980
Where is she, Charlie?

877
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:31,390
Wally's Hotel.

878
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:33,860
Ringo blew into town, and
Kate's taken up with him.

879
00:50:41,130 --> 00:50:43,260
Sure is a lot of beef
coming in here.

880
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:47,560
This is just the beginning.

881
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:48,630
Wait till the...

882
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:50,370
Look, Doc,
a gunfight right now

883
00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:52,340
could cause Wyatt
a lot of trouble.

884
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:54,040
A lot of trouble.

885
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:56,540
Sure is a mess
of cattle here.

886
00:51:35,290 --> 00:51:37,350
Get out and stay out,
you no-good tramp!

887
00:51:37,390 --> 00:51:38,550
And don't come back!

888
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:03,110
Widened my mind...

889
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:09,480
My mind is to marry, love,
and leave you behind.

890
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,260
So you got homesick.

891
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:23,900
Well, well.

892
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,300
If it ain't
the little deputy.

893
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:27,670
You've been gone
for three days.

894
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:29,570
I didn't think you'd notice.

895
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:31,540
You've been gallivanting
all over the country

896
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:32,600
with Mr. Virtue.

897
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,110
I was sick, Kate.

898
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:35,510
I needed you.

899
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:41,380
Why don't you put a rope
around my neck and...

900
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:43,280
and pull on it
when you want me?

901
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:44,310
Can't stay away.

902
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,260
Just can't stay away,
can you?

903
00:52:46,290 --> 00:52:47,760
Oh, leave me alone, Doc.

904
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:51,850
Always got to crawl
back to your gutter.

905
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:52,950
Maybe I wouldn't

906
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,120
if you ever noticed
I was alive!

907
00:52:55,170 --> 00:52:56,690
What difference
does it make to you

908
00:52:56,730 --> 00:52:58,220
where I go or who
I take up with?

909
00:52:58,270 --> 00:52:59,600
Shut up!

910
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:03,700
Get your things together,
you're leaving.

911
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:09,140
She's staying here.

912
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:11,380
Keep out of this, Ringo.

913
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:13,380
You got no right to
come busting in here.

914
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:14,750
I’m talking to Kate.

915
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:15,770
Take a walk.

916
00:53:17,790 --> 00:53:20,280
Anything you got to say,
you can say in front of him.

917
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:25,290
You slut.

918
00:53:25,330 --> 00:53:26,960
Wait a minute, Holliday.

919
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,660
You don't talk to
my woman like that.

920
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,300
''Your woman.''

921
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:33,890
Anybody's woman.

922
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:36,000
I’m going to
blast you apart.

923
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:39,130
I don't have a gun, Ringo.

924
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:46,910
You got one now.

925
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,590
Reach.

926
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:05,830
I’m not fighting.

927
00:54:05,870 --> 00:54:07,390
He won't fight.

928
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:08,770
He promised Wyatt Earp

929
00:54:08,810 --> 00:54:10,210
he'd be a good little boy.

930
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,180
I heard you made
your reputation

931
00:54:12,210 --> 00:54:13,800
against a bunch of drunks.

932
00:54:15,650 --> 00:54:17,200
Go on, reach.

933
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:24,650
I’m not fighting.

934
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:27,190
Well, have a drink, then.

935
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:42,530
Oh, Doc.

936
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:09,630
It was a lovely dance.

937
00:55:09,730 --> 00:55:11,560
I’m sorry I have
to leave so soon.

938
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,430
You're breaking
a lot of hearts.

939
00:55:13,470 --> 00:55:14,600
Good night, Mayor Kelly.

940
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:15,830
Good night, Miss Denbow.

941
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:21,210
May I take you somewhere?

942
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:22,910
No, thank you,
it's just a short way.

943
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:25,310
It’s early, and I have
to ride up to the bluffs.

944
00:55:44,070 --> 00:55:45,900
Oh, it is lovely here.

945
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:47,600
I’m glad I came.

946
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:09,190
You've lost your poker face.

947
00:56:09,230 --> 00:56:11,090
You look like
a scared little girl.

948
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:14,960
I’m not scared.

949
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,030
And I’m certainly
not a little girl.

950
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:42,290
Why did you come
out here with me?

951
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:47,620
I wish I could answer that.

952
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:49,430
I don't know.

953
00:56:50,870 --> 00:56:52,360
I’ll tell you why you came.

954
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:28,900
Frisky bunch, eh, Ringo?

955
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:30,500
Yeah.

956
00:57:37,010 --> 00:57:39,040
This ought to learn 'em
once and for all

957
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,280
who owns the cow towns!

958
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:41,480
Yeah.

959
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:47,090
Shanghai Pierce is in town.

960
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:48,750
His men are hoo-hawing
Front Street.

961
00:57:48,790 --> 00:57:50,850
Now, see if you find Wyatt,
quick as you can

962
00:57:50,890 --> 00:57:51,950
and get some help.

963
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,620
I’ll try to hold them off.

964
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:55,690
I don't want anybody
out there on the streets!

965
00:58:03,570 --> 00:58:06,630
Pierce, call off your men
before somebody gets hurt.

966
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:11,610
Tell your boss I’m waiting
for his personal invitation.

967
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:13,310
You're under arrest, Pierce.

968
00:58:13,350 --> 00:58:15,050
You hear that, Ringo?

969
00:58:15,090 --> 00:58:17,320
I’m under arrest.

970
00:58:17,350 --> 00:58:18,410
I heard.

971
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:33,660
Sure are noisy.

972
00:58:36,410 --> 00:58:38,770
Sure are.

973
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:42,650
Let's quit.

974
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:44,200
I want to get out of here.

975
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:45,650
You just keep dealing.

976
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:47,280
I’m not breaking this run.

977
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:48,310
Hit me.

978
00:58:53,790 --> 00:58:55,380
Doc, please.

979
00:58:55,430 --> 00:58:56,690
Deal.

980
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:01,760
Well... what have we here?

981
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:02,770
A dance.

982
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,670
Now, ain't that nice?

983
00:59:06,170 --> 00:59:09,400
You folks going
to invite us in?

984
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:11,530
Ain't very hospitable,
are they, Boss?

985
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:14,200
You better get that scum
of yours south of the deadline.

986
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:15,970
You hear that, boys?

987
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:19,110
These are respectable folks.

988
00:59:19,150 --> 00:59:21,310
They're good enough
to take our money.

989
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:23,790
I say my men are good enough
to dance with your women.

990
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:50,370
My boys want to dance!

991
00:59:50,410 --> 00:59:53,440
Piano player, make some music!

992
00:59:55,850 --> 00:59:57,790
Make it lively!

993
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:20,070
Hello, Shanghai.

994
01:00:20,110 --> 01:00:21,770
Well...

995
01:00:21,810 --> 01:00:25,650
Now my day is complete.

996
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:27,120
You and me are going to settle

997
01:00:27,150 --> 01:00:28,950
for this scar
you gave me in Wichita.

998
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:33,650
Unbuckle your guns, boys,

999
01:00:33,690 --> 01:00:35,450
and come on down
to the calaboose with me.

1000
01:00:35,490 --> 01:00:37,390
You better start praying, Earp.

1001
01:00:37,430 --> 01:00:38,790
You pulled your last bluff.

1002
01:00:38,830 --> 01:00:39,960
Start thinking
straight, Shanghai,

1003
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,260
before you get
into too much trouble

1004
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:42,390
and you can't get out of it.

1005
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:43,920
Let's work him over, Boss.

1006
01:00:43,970 --> 01:00:45,960
That's a real good idea.

1007
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,560
Maybe your friends
would like to see

1008
01:00:48,610 --> 01:00:49,830
how tough you really are.

1009
01:00:49,870 --> 01:00:51,860
I’d like to see you
do a dance, Marshal.

1010
01:00:51,910 --> 01:00:53,840
That's mighty
brave talk, Shanghai,

1011
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:55,710
with 20 men behind you.

1012
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:58,540
Let's you and me step out
into the street, alone.

1013
01:00:58,580 --> 01:01:01,680
Oh, no, you don't sucker me
into that!

1014
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:04,850
Can't bluff
your way out, huh?

1015
01:01:04,890 --> 01:01:07,320
All right, boys,
take this skunk.

1016
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:15,190
You gentlemen
made such a racket,

1017
01:01:15,230 --> 01:01:17,060
Frank Loving
was too scared to deal.

1018
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:18,590
You busted my winning streak.

1019
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:21,430
Fun's over, boys.

1020
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:22,600
Unbuckle 'em.

1021
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:24,110
Let's shoot it out.

1022
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:25,610
All right, Shanghai?

1023
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,540
Go ahead, draw, all of you.

1024
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:29,840
But you get it first, Shanghai.

1025
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:31,370
And you second, Ringo.

1026
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:33,210
Well, call the play.

1027
01:01:33,250 --> 01:01:37,450
I’ll give you five seconds
to unbuckle your guns.

1028
01:01:37,490 --> 01:01:38,960
One.

1029
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:42,020
Two.

1030
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:45,430
Three.

1031
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:46,790
Four.

1032
01:01:46,830 --> 01:01:48,700
We had enough fun, boys.

1033
01:01:48,770 --> 01:01:50,700
Unbuckle 'em.

1034
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:52,600
Harry, Jackson,
get the hardware.

1035
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,470
Get moving.

1036
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:55,530
Doc!

1037
01:01:59,510 --> 01:02:01,410
Anybody else
want to try their luck?

1038
01:02:02,690 --> 01:02:03,580
Get moving.

1039
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:04,850
Come on, keep moving!

1040
01:02:04,890 --> 01:02:05,860
All of you!

1041
01:02:05,890 --> 01:02:07,950
All right, Doc, we
ain't finished yet.

1042
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:09,650
You would have been,

1043
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:12,020
but I feel in
a charitable mood tonight.

1044
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:28,240
Keep moving, come on.

1045
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:34,140
Kelly, take them down

1046
01:02:34,180 --> 01:02:35,540
and lock them up
for the night.

1047
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:37,210
You heard the marshal.

1048
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:39,010
Come on,
let's get moving!

1049
01:02:41,650 --> 01:02:44,620
I don't suppose
you want my thanks.

1050
01:02:44,650 --> 01:02:47,210
Let's just say
my account is paid in full.

1051
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:49,990
And don't take it
personal, Marshal.

1052
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:12,800
Mornin', Doc.

1053
01:03:12,850 --> 01:03:14,250
Good morning.

1054
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:20,750
Just thought
you'd like to know,

1055
01:03:20,790 --> 01:03:22,220
there's going to be

1056
01:03:22,290 --> 01:03:23,990
one less lawman
in the territory.

1057
01:03:24,030 --> 01:03:25,550
That's always
good news to me.

1058
01:03:25,590 --> 01:03:27,120
I’m heading
for California,

1059
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:29,600
buying a ranch,
taking your good advice--

1060
01:03:29,630 --> 01:03:31,460
getting out
while there's time.

1061
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:32,590
Smart man.

1062
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:34,600
Laura's coming with me.

1063
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:37,770
We're getting married
in a few days.

1064
01:03:37,810 --> 01:03:40,500
We'd like you to come
to the wedding, Doc,

1065
01:03:40,540 --> 01:03:42,940
if it doesn't interfere
with your poker.

1066
01:03:42,980 --> 01:03:45,240
I’m not good at weddings,
only funerals.

1067
01:03:45,350 --> 01:03:46,870
Deal me out.

1068
01:03:51,450 --> 01:03:54,220
Wyatt...

1069
01:03:54,260 --> 01:03:55,880
You know,
she's a real lady.

1070
01:03:55,930 --> 01:03:58,120
I wish you both
a lot of happiness.

1071
01:03:58,160 --> 01:03:59,990
Ah, you're lucky

1072
01:04:00,030 --> 01:04:02,160
to be getting out
of this country.

1073
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:04,460
Why don't you try your luck?

1074
01:04:06,140 --> 01:04:07,430
Mmm...

1075
01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:11,300
So long, Doc.

1076
01:04:28,220 --> 01:04:30,590
Take me back, Doc?

1077
01:04:32,130 --> 01:04:33,290
Please?

1078
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:37,560
Give me another chance.

1079
01:04:44,270 --> 01:04:46,940
Please, take me back.

1080
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:50,340
I’ll do anything you say.

1081
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:53,480
I don’t care how you treat me.

1082
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:58,550
Doc, I’m sorry for what I done.

1083
01:04:58,590 --> 01:05:00,350
It’s not your fault, Kate.

1084
01:05:00,390 --> 01:05:02,150
It’s not my fault.

1085
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:03,890
It’s not anybody's fault.

1086
01:05:03,930 --> 01:05:06,950
It’s just the way
the cards fall.

1087
01:05:10,570 --> 01:05:13,400
Never gave you
much of a chance, did I?

1088
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:17,830
Well, maybe
it could have been different

1089
01:05:17,870 --> 01:05:19,500
if I was right to you, but...

1090
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:21,530
It ain't too late, Doc.

1091
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:24,340
I’ll be good to you, I promise.

1092
01:05:24,380 --> 01:05:26,080
It’s too late for both of us.

1093
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:27,950
Do something better
for yourself

1094
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:29,750
while you've still
got the chance.

1095
01:05:44,930 --> 01:05:46,370
Don't let me go, Doc.

1096
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,230
Don't let me go back there.

1097
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:49,860
Leave me alone,

1098
01:05:49,910 --> 01:05:51,500
just... leave me alone.

1099
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:04,140
I’ll see you dead.

1100
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:24,200
Hiya, Wyatt.

1101
01:06:24,270 --> 01:06:25,400
Charlie.

1102
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:26,570
You got a letter

1103
01:06:26,610 --> 01:06:27,870
from the Attorney General.

1104
01:06:27,910 --> 01:06:28,930
What's he got to say?

1105
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:37,320
He says he can get you an
appointment as U.S. marshal

1106
01:06:37,350 --> 01:06:38,820
anytime you want it.

1107
01:06:38,850 --> 01:06:41,450
''Wyatt Earp, United
States marshal''--

1108
01:06:41,490 --> 01:06:43,320
that's all I need.

1109
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:45,490
These are all dead, Charlie.

1110
01:06:45,530 --> 01:06:47,890
Oh, before I forget...

1111
01:06:47,930 --> 01:06:50,230
This is yours now.

1112
01:06:50,330 --> 01:06:52,930
I’m through as
a lawman for good.

1113
01:06:54,940 --> 01:06:56,400
Oh, you got
a telegram, too.

1114
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:58,270
Read it.

1115
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:26,190
Virgil's my brother.

1116
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:28,330
He's in trouble, he needs me.

1117
01:07:28,370 --> 01:07:30,170
Try to understand, Laura.

1118
01:07:30,210 --> 01:07:33,000
I understand I was foolish
to fall in love.

1119
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:34,440
Oh, if only I could...

1120
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:35,770
Wyatt, when
I first met you,

1121
01:07:35,810 --> 01:07:37,210
I told you
I wouldn't follow you

1122
01:07:37,310 --> 01:07:39,300
from town to town,
sitting in the darkness,

1123
01:07:39,350 --> 01:07:42,110
waiting for someone to bring
the news you've been killed;

1124
01:07:42,150 --> 01:07:43,480
I won't live that way.

1125
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:45,150
We're not going to
start a life together

1126
01:07:45,190 --> 01:07:46,150
with a gun in your hand.

1127
01:07:46,190 --> 01:07:47,160
I swear to you, Laura,

1128
01:07:47,190 --> 01:07:48,350
I’m through after Tombstone.

1129
01:07:48,390 --> 01:07:49,720
You'll never be through.

1130
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:52,190
Your reputation will follow you
wherever you are.

1131
01:07:52,230 --> 01:07:53,320
Laura, he's my brother...

1132
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:54,620
And I’m to be your wife.

1133
01:07:54,660 --> 01:07:56,320
Don't ask me
to let him down.

1134
01:07:56,370 --> 01:07:58,160
Don't let me down.

1135
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:01,070
I’d give up anything,
I’d go anywhere for you.

1136
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:03,230
I’ll work beside you
in the fields.

1137
01:08:03,270 --> 01:08:05,670
But you've got
to meet me halfway.

1138
01:08:24,290 --> 01:08:26,990
I must go to Tombstone.

1139
01:08:27,030 --> 01:08:31,190
All right, go,
clean up Tombstone.

1140
01:08:31,230 --> 01:08:34,600
There's a hundred more
Tombstones on the frontier,

1141
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:37,540
all waiting for
the great Wyatt Earp.

1142
01:08:37,570 --> 01:08:39,600
Go on, clean them all up.

1143
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:42,270
Go on!

1144
01:08:43,780 --> 01:08:45,340
I love you, Laura.

1145
01:09:13,940 --> 01:09:15,410
I love you, Wyatt.

Good afternoon, Marshal.

1153
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:13,860
Out for a little ride?

1154
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:15,730
About 700-miles-worth:
Tombstone.

1155
01:10:15,770 --> 01:10:17,330
Tombstone, huh?

1156
01:10:17,370 --> 01:10:19,070
I was headin'
that way myself.

1157
01:10:19,110 --> 01:10:20,940
Understand the climate
down there

1158
01:10:20,980 --> 01:10:22,500
may be better for my cough.

1159
01:10:22,540 --> 01:10:24,100
Since when have you
gotten interested

1160
01:10:24,150 --> 01:10:25,480
in your health?

1161
01:10:25,510 --> 01:10:27,180
Well, it's really
a matter of finances;

1162
01:10:27,220 --> 01:10:29,580
the deck's gone cold here,
nobody'll give me any play.

1163
01:10:29,620 --> 01:10:31,640
Mind if I ride along?

1164
01:10:31,690 --> 01:10:33,750
It’s a free country,
hop on.

1165
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:35,810

1177

Well, thanks
for the ride.

1178
01:11:57,910 --> 01:11:59,840
Sell my horse,
and get a good price.

1179
01:12:03,050 --> 01:12:04,540
Doc.

1180
01:12:04,580 --> 01:12:07,910
I know, no knives,
no guns, no killing, huh?

1181
01:12:17,630 --> 01:12:19,220
Man, that's good.

1182
01:12:19,290 --> 01:12:22,130
I just about forgot what
a home-cooked meal tastes like.

1183
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:24,500
Betty, I’m going to steal you
away from Virgil.

1184
01:12:24,530 --> 01:12:25,730
By golly, Wyatt,

1185
01:12:25,770 --> 01:12:27,600
you're going to be
the only single one left.

1186
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:29,190
I got a family going
in Deadwood.

1187
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:30,930
Even little Jimmy here
is tying the knot

1188
01:12:30,970 --> 01:12:32,500
when he gets back
to California.

1189
01:12:32,540 --> 01:12:34,570
What do you mean,
''Little Jimmy''?

1190
01:12:34,610 --> 01:12:36,130
I’ll be 1 9 next month.

1191
01:12:37,180 --> 01:12:38,440
Nineteen.

1192
01:12:40,180 --> 01:12:43,150
Say, when are you going
to get hitched, Wyatt?

1193
01:12:46,150 --> 01:12:48,210
Cigar?

1194
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:50,050
There's the signal

1195
01:12:50,090 --> 01:12:52,490
for women and children
to leave the room.

1196
01:12:52,530 --> 01:12:54,790
Come on, Tommy,
it's your bedtime now.

1197
01:12:54,830 --> 01:12:56,390
Oh, Mom, do I have to?

1198
01:12:56,430 --> 01:12:57,490
Yes, you do.

1199
01:12:57,530 --> 01:12:59,190
Your uncles
will all be here tomorrow.

1200
01:12:59,230 --> 01:13:00,530
Good night, Uncle Wyatt.

1201
01:13:00,570 --> 01:13:01,540
Good night, Tommy.

1202
01:13:01,570 --> 01:13:02,730
Good night, Uncle Morgan.

1203
01:13:02,770 --> 01:13:04,030
Good night, son.

1204
01:13:04,070 --> 01:13:05,200
Good night, Uncle James.

1205
01:13:05,270 --> 01:13:06,370
Good night, Tommy.

1206
01:13:06,410 --> 01:13:07,500
Good night, Daddy.

1207
01:13:07,540 --> 01:13:08,530
Good night, son.

1208
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:13,980
It’s nice to have you here.

1209
01:13:14,020 --> 01:13:17,580
I only wish it were under
happier circumstances.

1210
01:13:27,230 --> 01:13:28,920
She seems pretty upset.

1211
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:31,020
Well, she's been
asking me for a year

1212
01:13:31,070 --> 01:13:32,230
to quit marshaling.

1213
01:13:32,330 --> 01:13:33,960
You know how women are.

1214
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:38,640
All right, now let's
get down to business.

1215
01:13:38,670 --> 01:13:41,230
Now, Morgan and Jimmy
know the setup here.

1216
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:42,830
Now, Wyatt,
you know Ike Clanton.

1217
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,470
He has a ranch outside
city limits.

1218
01:13:44,510 --> 01:13:45,780
Yes, I know.

1219
01:13:45,810 --> 01:13:48,340
He's organized the toughest
bunch of gunslingers

1220
01:13:48,380 --> 01:13:49,710
you ever laid eyes on,

1221
01:13:49,750 --> 01:13:51,380
and he owns the county sheriff.

1222
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:52,390
Who is he?

1223
01:13:52,420 --> 01:13:53,510
Cotton Wilson.

1224
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:54,680
Cotton Wilson.

1225
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:56,450
So Ike paid off on his deed.

1226
01:13:56,490 --> 01:13:59,890
Clanton's been rustling
Mexican cattle by the thousands.

1227
01:13:59,930 --> 01:14:01,260
And he has to move them,

1228
01:14:01,300 --> 01:14:03,700
but he can only ship them out
of Tombstone,

1229
01:14:03,730 --> 01:14:06,390
and he can't do that
while we control the city.

1230
01:14:06,430 --> 01:14:07,870
That's about it.

1231
01:14:07,900 --> 01:14:10,060
He's organized
and he's mean.

1232
01:14:10,110 --> 01:14:12,070
We can't keep him out
of Tombstone forever.

1233
01:14:12,110 --> 01:14:13,730
What about the people
of Tombstone?

1234
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:15,500
John Clum,
editor of the ''Epitaph,''

1235
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:18,010
and some of the leading citizens
will back us

1236
01:14:18,050 --> 01:14:20,170
if they know
you're calling the shots.

1237
01:14:20,220 --> 01:14:23,210
We're all agreed, Wyatt,
you should run the show.

1238
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:32,080
There's only one thing
that bothers me

1239
01:14:32,130 --> 01:14:35,060
and I’m going to
speak my piece now.

1240
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:37,720
There's going to be
a lot of bad talk

1241
01:14:37,770 --> 01:14:40,230
about you riding
with Doc Holliday.

1242
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:42,100
What about
Holliday?

1243
01:14:42,140 --> 01:14:44,200
He's the worst killer
on the frontier,

1244
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:45,430
that's what about him.

1245
01:14:45,470 --> 01:14:50,070
It just don't look good,
you coming here with him.

1246
01:14:50,110 --> 01:14:52,140
Holliday saved my life
in Dodge City;

1247
01:14:52,180 --> 01:14:53,240
I don’t forget that.

1248
01:14:53,350 --> 01:14:55,440
What's more,
he's a man of his word.

1249
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:57,420
As long as he plays
his cards straight

1250
01:14:57,450 --> 01:14:58,710
and keeps out of killings,

1251
01:14:58,750 --> 01:15:00,720
we got no right to run him
out of town.

1252
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:02,350
I didn't know you
two were a team.

1253
01:15:02,390 --> 01:15:03,380
We're not.

1254
01:15:03,430 --> 01:15:05,020
It’s just a case
of square deal.

1255
01:15:05,060 --> 01:15:07,050
Holliday stays.

1256
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:09,790
All right, Wyatt,
he's your responsibility.

1257
01:15:09,830 --> 01:15:10,990
That suits me fine.

1258
01:15:11,030 --> 01:15:13,360
Now, do we have a map
of the county here?

1259
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:15,340
Now, the first thing
we got to do

1260
01:15:15,370 --> 01:15:18,740
is let the Clantons know
that the city is closed to them.

1261
01:15:18,770 --> 01:15:20,830
Then we got to control
the county.

1262
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:22,210
Now, that's important.

1263
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:23,970
I’m going to get a letter off
to a man tonight

1264
01:15:24,010 --> 01:15:25,740
who'll take care of that
little matter for us.

1265
01:15:25,780 --> 01:15:27,300
Now, show me where
the Clanton ranch is.

1266
01:15:27,350 --> 01:15:28,340
Here.

1267
01:15:39,330 --> 01:15:41,850
Hello, Cotton, I’ve
been expecting you.

1268
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:42,990
You're looking fine.

1269
01:15:43,030 --> 01:15:44,660
Real prosperous.

1270
01:15:44,700 --> 01:15:46,130
Oh, I ain't complaining.

1271
01:15:46,170 --> 01:15:47,730
What's on your mind?

1272
01:15:47,770 --> 01:15:50,530
Wyatt, Ike wants
to make you a deal.

1273
01:15:50,570 --> 01:15:51,830
He promises no trouble

1274
01:15:51,870 --> 01:15:54,240
if you'll let him ship
his cattle out of Tombstone.

1275
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:55,830
Well, that's mighty
nice of Ike.

1276
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:56,970
Ike is a nice fella.

1277
01:15:57,010 --> 01:15:58,980
He's got a fortune
tied up in cattle

1278
01:15:59,010 --> 01:16:00,240
out there at the ranch,

1279
01:16:00,350 --> 01:16:01,870
and he's going
to move them.

1280
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:03,910
Oh, he is, huh?

1281
01:16:10,730 --> 01:16:13,960
There's $20,000
in it for you-- cash.

1282
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:17,760
$20,000.

1283
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:19,530
The wages of sin are rising.

1284
01:16:19,570 --> 01:16:22,900
$20,000 against
a six-foot hole in Boot Hill,

1285
01:16:22,940 --> 01:16:24,340
or a $20-a-month pension

1286
01:16:24,370 --> 01:16:26,640
if you live long enough
to collect it.

1287
01:16:32,310 --> 01:16:34,080
I’ve thought
about those things.

1288
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:42,620
You know, Cotton,

1289
01:16:42,660 --> 01:16:44,780
this is a nice little town.

1290
01:16:44,830 --> 01:16:46,420
A good place to set awhile.

1291
01:16:46,460 --> 01:16:49,830
I might even run for county
sheriff in a couple of months.

1292
01:16:49,860 --> 01:16:51,200
That don't scare me at all.

1293
01:16:51,230 --> 01:16:52,760
I got mine.

1294
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:55,130
I got a ranch now
and $25,000 in the bank.

1295
01:16:55,170 --> 01:16:56,430
And you know something?

1296
01:16:56,470 --> 01:16:58,600
It don't bother my sleep,
not one bit.

1297
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:00,070
It would mine, though.

1298
01:17:01,410 --> 01:17:03,810
Why don't you get off
that pulpit, Wyatt?

1299
01:17:03,850 --> 01:17:05,340
Ellsworth, Wichita,
Dodge City,

1300
01:17:05,380 --> 01:17:07,810
and what have they got you
but a life full of misery

1301
01:17:07,850 --> 01:17:09,340
and a woman who
walked out on you

1302
01:17:09,380 --> 01:17:10,850
and the friendship
of a killer.

1303
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:16,880
Take this message back
to your boss.

1304
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:30,830
So that's the way
he wants it, huh?

1305
01:17:30,870 --> 01:17:33,770
He aims to pull the town
out from under you, Ike.

1306
01:17:39,950 --> 01:17:44,610
I immediately raised my hat

1307
01:17:44,650 --> 01:17:48,180
And finally she remarked:

1308
01:17:48,220 --> 01:17:51,620
I'll never shall forget

1309
01:17:51,660 --> 01:17:55,760
That lovely afternoon''

1310
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:59,390
I met her at the fountain
in the park.

1311
01:18:04,410 --> 01:18:06,370
A long time, Ike.

1312
01:18:06,410 --> 01:18:07,500
Too long.

1313
01:18:07,540 --> 01:18:08,840
Hello, Ringo.

1314
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:10,570
Still renting your gun
to the highest bidder?

1315
01:18:14,050 --> 01:18:16,310
Ain't you a little young
to be packing a gun, son?

1316
01:18:16,350 --> 01:18:18,250
Why don't you try me?

1317
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:24,850
Going someplace?

1318
01:18:24,890 --> 01:18:26,690
We're taking in
the show, Marshal.

1319
01:18:26,730 --> 01:18:27,960
Any objections?

1320
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,190
No, as soon as you check in
your side arms.

1321
01:18:30,230 --> 01:18:32,560
Why don't you check it in
for me, Marshal?

1322
01:18:34,570 --> 01:18:35,560
Stop!

1323
01:18:37,910 --> 01:18:39,200
You boys know my brothers.

1324
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:42,070
Meet John Clum,
head of the Citizens' Committee.

1325
01:18:42,110 --> 01:18:44,340
You're a marked man, Wyatt.

1326
01:18:44,380 --> 01:18:46,750
There's no place in
this town for you, Ike.

1327
01:18:46,780 --> 01:18:48,210
The next time
you ride in armed,

1328
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:49,440
you ride out feet first.

1329
01:18:51,250 --> 01:18:52,410
Now get moving.

1330
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:44,000
Here comes trouble.

1331
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:46,100
Who is she?

1332
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:47,200
She's Kate Fisher.

1333
01:19:47,310 --> 01:19:49,040
She just couldn't stay away.

1334
01:19:55,580 --> 01:19:56,980
Four blues.

1335
01:19:57,020 --> 01:20:00,110
Call them, you suckers.

1336
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:02,560
Barkeep, some whiskey
down here.

1337
01:20:02,590 --> 01:20:04,820
Leave the bottle.

1338
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:06,160
Two pairs.

1339
01:20:06,190 --> 01:20:08,790
Aces up.

1340
01:20:08,830 --> 01:20:10,920
Hey, Doc, what have you got?

1341
01:20:10,970 --> 01:20:12,190
Three tres.

1342
01:20:12,230 --> 01:20:13,860
Nice town, huh, Kate?

1343
01:20:17,270 --> 01:20:19,210
Well, well, well.

1344
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:21,170
If it ain't the little deputy.

1345
01:20:25,580 --> 01:20:27,840
Doc, you deal.

1346
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,650
Ain't you gonna say hello
to an old friend?

1347
01:20:33,690 --> 01:20:35,210
Draw.

1348
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:38,560
Give me some crème de menthe.

1349
01:20:43,100 --> 01:20:45,360
Hey, little deputy...

1350
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,600
would you like to have
another drink with me?

1351
01:20:51,010 --> 01:20:53,030
You're drunk,
Ringo.

1352
01:20:53,070 --> 01:20:55,540
It’s the way you made
your reputation, wasn't it...

1353
01:20:55,580 --> 01:20:57,240
against drunks?

1354
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:02,480
Get your gun.

1355
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:03,950
I’ll meet you
in the street

1356
01:21:03,990 --> 01:21:04,970
in five minutes.

1357
01:21:05,020 --> 01:21:06,780
I’ll be there.

1358
01:21:13,290 --> 01:21:15,130
I said I’d see you dead.

1359
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:37,690
What kind of a sucker play
is this?

1360
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:39,910
It’s all Clanton needs
to start a war.

1361
01:21:39,950 --> 01:21:41,390
Look, I’ve had it
up to here.

1362
01:21:41,420 --> 01:21:43,950
If you want to play patty-cake
with him, go ahead.

1363
01:21:45,090 --> 01:21:46,190
Give me your gun, Doc.

1364
01:21:46,230 --> 01:21:47,920
You've got no right packing it.

1365
01:21:53,300 --> 01:21:56,270
Now, you can...

1366
01:21:56,370 --> 01:21:59,270
you can thank God
you're Wyatt Earp's brother.

1367
01:21:59,310 --> 01:22:02,710
Holliday, if you think
anything about Wyatt,

1368
01:22:02,740 --> 01:22:04,580
you'll get out of here.

1369
01:22:04,610 --> 01:22:06,100
Having a killer like you around

1370
01:22:06,150 --> 01:22:08,210
is the worst thing
that can happen to him.

1371
01:22:57,500 --> 01:22:59,260
I hear you're
leaving Tombstone.

1372
01:22:59,330 --> 01:23:01,500
You hear good.

1373
01:23:01,540 --> 01:23:03,530
I’m taking
the stage tomorrow.

1374
01:23:08,110 --> 01:23:09,470
I kind of thought
this climate

1375
01:23:09,510 --> 01:23:10,640
was good for your cough.

1376
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:11,910
Listen, preacher,

1377
01:23:11,950 --> 01:23:15,470
being here has caused me
a lot of embarrassment.

1378
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:18,110
Some people are even
taking me as a lawman.

1379
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:21,890
You're not leaving
on my account?

1380
01:23:22,890 --> 01:23:25,220
Your account?

1381
01:23:25,260 --> 01:23:27,490
You've got nothing to do
with my leaving.

1382
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:41,510
Good luck, Doc.

1383
01:23:53,050 --> 01:23:55,850
Too bad we won't be in
on the finish together.

1384
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,160
Hi, Wyatt.

1385
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:09,400
Here's that letter
you've been waiting for.

1386
01:24:24,090 --> 01:24:25,640
Who do we got here?

1387
01:24:25,690 --> 01:24:27,210
Young Clanton
passed out drunk

1388
01:24:27,260 --> 01:24:28,310
at the Alhambra.

1389
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:31,020
Throw him in the tank
and let him sleep it off.

1390
01:24:31,060 --> 01:24:32,580
Hold it a minute.

1391
01:24:34,100 --> 01:24:35,720
John, how long
is it going to take you

1392
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:37,230
to get those men
you promised me?

1393
01:24:37,270 --> 01:24:38,730
Anytime you say.

1394
01:24:38,770 --> 01:24:41,360
I think I’ll take a little trip
out to the Clanton ranch.

1395
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:42,390
Are you crazy?!

1396
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:43,530
I don’t think so.

1397
01:24:43,570 --> 01:24:44,730
Well, take your gun.

1398
01:24:44,770 --> 01:24:46,600
This is all the ammunition
I’ll need.

1399
01:24:52,150 --> 01:24:54,340
If I’m not back
in a couple of hours, Virg,

1400
01:24:54,380 --> 01:24:57,350
have Clum's Citizens' Committee
drag my carcass out.

1401
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:15,930
Whoa, whoa.

1402
01:26:08,420 --> 01:26:09,790
Billy!

1403
01:26:09,820 --> 01:26:11,190
He's all right, ma'am,

1404
01:26:11,260 --> 01:26:12,990
just got himself
a little liquored up.

1405
01:26:13,030 --> 01:26:14,220
All right, on your feet.

1406
01:26:18,930 --> 01:26:20,800
Billy! You get in the house.

1407
01:26:39,950 --> 01:26:41,950
I don’t know what I’m going
to do with that boy.

1408
01:26:41,990 --> 01:26:43,460
Way he's going now,

1409
01:26:43,490 --> 01:26:45,550
he's going to end up
like his father,

1410
01:26:45,590 --> 01:26:47,290
shot down
for stealing cattle.

1411
01:26:51,830 --> 01:26:53,460
You think
you're pretty tough,

1412
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:55,030
don't you, son?

1413
01:26:55,070 --> 01:26:56,630
I never saw a gunslinger yet

1414
01:26:56,670 --> 01:26:59,470
so tough he lived to celebrate
his 35th birthday.

1415
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:05,440
I learned one rule
about gunslingers:

1416
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:06,910
There's always a man

1417
01:27:06,950 --> 01:27:08,640
faster on the draw
than you are,

1418
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:10,380
and the more you use a gun

1419
01:27:10,420 --> 01:27:12,650
the sooner you're going
to run into that man.

1420
01:27:15,390 --> 01:27:18,420
You think I don't know
what's inside of you.

1421
01:27:18,460 --> 01:27:20,590
I had a couple
of big brothers.

1422
01:27:20,630 --> 01:27:24,330
They fought in the Civil War
and I was too young to go.

1423
01:27:24,370 --> 01:27:26,200
I tried to live up
to them the same way

1424
01:27:26,300 --> 01:27:28,390
you're trying to live up
to Ike and Finn.

1425
01:27:32,870 --> 01:27:34,500
You know about that, huh?

1426
01:27:34,540 --> 01:27:36,480
You can bet I know about that.

1427
01:27:36,510 --> 01:27:39,500
It’s not that I want
to be a gunfighter, exactly.

1428
01:27:39,550 --> 01:27:42,680
It’s just... I don't know,
sometimes I get lonely.

1429
01:27:46,420 --> 01:27:48,220
All gunfighters are lonely.

1430
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:50,590
They live in fear.

1431
01:27:50,630 --> 01:27:53,750
They die without a dime
or a woman or a friend.

1432
01:27:53,790 --> 01:27:56,060
You know, I never
thought about it like that.

1433
01:27:56,100 --> 01:27:57,960
Well, think about
it, think about it.

1434
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:01,160
Billy, listen to the marshal.

1435
01:28:05,110 --> 01:28:06,870
I won't do it no more, Ma.

1436
01:28:06,910 --> 01:28:08,340
Oh, Billy...

1437
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:37,460
What are you doin' here?

1438
01:28:37,510 --> 01:28:41,440
Brought your kid
brother home, drunk.

1439
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:44,930
You should be proud,
real proud.

1440
01:28:44,980 --> 01:28:47,570
You'd better get ridin'.

1441
01:28:53,350 --> 01:28:55,020
I wouldn't do that, Ike.

1442
01:28:56,420 --> 01:28:57,760
Some of my friends in Tombstone

1443
01:28:57,790 --> 01:28:59,620
might begin to worry
if I’m not back soon.

1444
01:28:59,660 --> 01:29:01,590
That don't cut
no ice with me, Wyatt.

1445
01:29:01,630 --> 01:29:03,720
You're out of your territory
this time.

1446
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:05,290
Am I?

1447
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:10,900
My appointment,
United States marshal.

1448
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:23,180
Sorry to
disappoint you.

1449
01:29:23,250 --> 01:29:25,410
Now, wait a minute, Wyatt,

1450
01:29:25,450 --> 01:29:26,650
I’m not lookin' for a fight,

1451
01:29:26,690 --> 01:29:28,050
but you got
to stop pushin' me.

1452
01:29:28,090 --> 01:29:29,990
Now, why don't we sit down
and talk it over?

1453
01:29:30,020 --> 01:29:31,690
I’ll make you
any kind of deal you ask.

1454
01:29:31,730 --> 01:29:33,160
The only deal I want

1455
01:29:33,190 --> 01:29:34,660
is for you to run
that stolen herd

1456
01:29:34,700 --> 01:29:36,130
back to Mexico.

1457
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:37,390
Hyah!

1458
01:29:55,050 --> 01:29:56,350
Did you see the judge?

1459
01:29:56,380 --> 01:29:57,750
I seen him.

1460
01:29:57,790 --> 01:29:59,220
Well?

1461
01:29:59,290 --> 01:30:01,220
There's no legal way
you can keep

1462
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:03,750
a United States marshal
out of the county.

1463
01:30:03,790 --> 01:30:06,590
Judge was packin' up
to leave when I got there.

1464
01:30:06,630 --> 01:30:10,220
I think it's about time
we all pack up and leave, Ike.

1465
01:30:10,300 --> 01:30:11,230
Shut up, Frank.

1466
01:30:11,270 --> 01:30:12,860
Only one thing we can do.

1467
01:30:12,900 --> 01:30:16,430
We didn't have no trouble
till that Wyatt Earp got here.

1468
01:30:16,470 --> 01:30:20,200
You're makin' sense now, Ike.

1469
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:23,180
All right... we got no choice.

1470
01:30:23,210 --> 01:30:24,840
We'll ambush him tonight.

1471
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:27,370
Ain't you forgettin'
about the rest of the Earps?

1472
01:30:27,410 --> 01:30:29,350
Now, look,
we can handle the Earps

1473
01:30:29,380 --> 01:30:31,250
if we make this
a personal fight.

1474
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:32,790
What if they bring in Clum?!

1475
01:30:32,820 --> 01:30:34,720
They won't, they're too proud.

1476
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:37,550
They're going to come to us
the way we want.

1477
01:30:37,590 --> 01:30:43,620
It’s a law-- bigger than any law
on the books-- family pride.

1478
01:30:43,660 --> 01:30:46,600
We'll get that Wyatt
when he makes his late round.

1479
01:30:54,540 --> 01:30:56,530
Don't make no difference to me.

1480
01:31:06,620 --> 01:31:08,210
Tired?

1481
01:31:08,290 --> 01:31:10,310
Yeah, I guess I must
have dozed a little.

1482
01:31:10,360 --> 01:31:11,950
Betty sent some coffee.

1483
01:31:11,990 --> 01:31:13,690
Well, that's going
to hit the spot.

1484
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:21,160
It’s awful quiet.

1485
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:23,860
Too quiet.

1486
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:30,910
Wyatt, do you figure we're going
to have to fight it out

1487
01:31:30,950 --> 01:31:31,930
with the Clantons?

1488
01:31:34,220 --> 01:31:36,240
I wish I knew, Jimmy.

1489
01:31:36,350 --> 01:31:39,180
Maybe Ike will see
how hopeless it all is.

1490
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:48,490
You itching to get
back to California?

1491
01:31:48,530 --> 01:31:50,050
I think about it
all the time.

1492
01:31:51,730 --> 01:31:53,260
She must be
quite a girl.

1493
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:54,630
Yes, she is.

1494
01:31:56,200 --> 01:31:58,140
Well...

1495
01:31:58,170 --> 01:32:00,160
I better get to work.

1496
01:32:01,410 --> 01:32:02,770
Look, how about letting me

1497
01:32:02,810 --> 01:32:04,570
make the rounds
for you tonight?

1498
01:32:04,610 --> 01:32:06,380
I get awful
lonesome sitting here

1499
01:32:06,410 --> 01:32:08,010
with nothing to do but think.

1500
01:32:08,050 --> 01:32:09,480
Sure, you go ahead.

1501
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:11,210
I could use some sleep.

1502
01:32:11,320 --> 01:32:12,790
At least,
when I’m making the rounds,

1503
01:32:12,820 --> 01:32:14,690
it gives me something else
to think about.

1504
01:34:27,050 --> 01:34:29,650
Ike's called the play.

1505
01:34:29,690 --> 01:34:31,520
We'll do it his way now.

1506
01:34:31,560 --> 01:34:33,620
Don't do that, Wyatt,
that's what they want.

1507
01:34:33,660 --> 01:34:35,860
Don't let them push you
into a personal fight.

1508
01:34:35,900 --> 01:34:37,630
That's mighty funny
coming from you.

1509
01:34:37,660 --> 01:34:38,820
You're a lawman, Wyatt--

1510
01:34:38,870 --> 01:34:40,560
don't throw away
a lifetime's work.

1511
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:41,630
Where's your logic?

1512
01:34:41,670 --> 01:34:43,030
To hell with logic.

1513
01:34:43,070 --> 01:34:45,540
That's my brother
lying there.

1514
01:35:27,250 --> 01:35:28,210
Who is it?

1515
01:35:28,280 --> 01:35:30,220
Open the door!

1516
01:35:40,790 --> 01:35:43,230
Start talkin', Kate.

1517
01:35:43,260 --> 01:35:46,060
Doc... I don't know
nothin' about it.

1518
01:35:46,100 --> 01:35:47,260
Talk.

1519
01:35:50,440 --> 01:35:51,600
Why?

1520
01:35:53,270 --> 01:35:56,270
What difference
does it make now?

1521
01:35:57,310 --> 01:36:00,470
I sure messed everything up
real good, ain't I?

1522
01:36:02,150 --> 01:36:06,750
I wanted you back,
and because I love you...

1523
01:36:06,790 --> 01:36:08,760
and... I...

1524
01:36:08,790 --> 01:36:11,050
I thought if Wyatt
was out of the way

1525
01:36:11,090 --> 01:36:12,960
you'd come back to me.

1526
01:36:12,990 --> 01:36:16,660
And that's... that's
why I kept quiet when I...

1527
01:36:16,700 --> 01:36:18,930
when I heard them.

1528
01:36:18,970 --> 01:36:21,530
I must have been out of my mind.

1529
01:36:21,570 --> 01:36:22,760
Where?

1530
01:36:25,510 --> 01:36:27,300
The Clanton ranch.

1531
01:36:27,340 --> 01:36:29,780
Who was there?

1532
01:36:29,810 --> 01:36:31,970
I didn't want that boy
to be killed!

1533
01:36:32,010 --> 01:36:34,450
Who was there?

1534
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:41,220
Ike, the kid... Cotton Wilson
and the McLowerys.

1535
01:36:41,260 --> 01:36:42,750
And Ringo?

1536
01:36:45,290 --> 01:36:46,780
Was Ringo there?!

1537
01:36:47,790 --> 01:36:50,420
Yes...
Ringo was there.

1538
01:36:53,700 --> 01:36:55,220
No, Doc...

1539
01:36:55,270 --> 01:36:56,630
Don't, Doc.

1540
01:36:56,670 --> 01:36:58,570
Don't, please don't, Doc.

1541
01:37:00,110 --> 01:37:01,100
Doc!

1542
01:37:18,890 --> 01:37:21,190
Please don't, Doc.

1543
01:37:21,230 --> 01:37:22,860
Please don't kill me.

1544
01:37:22,900 --> 01:37:23,990
Please...

1545
01:37:24,030 --> 01:37:25,360
Please!

1546
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:26,870
Please!

1547
01:37:26,900 --> 01:37:29,390
Don't kill me!

1548
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:20,980
Doc?

1549
01:38:22,160 --> 01:38:23,380
Doc!

1550
01:38:25,390 --> 01:38:28,090
Doc!

1551
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:31,950
Oh, Doc.

1552
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:35,530
It’s all right, honey.

1553
01:38:35,570 --> 01:38:37,430
It’s all right, honey.

1554
01:38:48,180 --> 01:38:49,210
Wyatt?

1555
01:38:50,250 --> 01:38:51,580
Ike sent me.

1556
01:38:59,590 --> 01:39:01,080
I didn't have nothin'
to do with it.

1557
01:39:01,130 --> 01:39:02,390
I didn't know
nothin' about...

1558
01:39:02,430 --> 01:39:03,920
You got to believe me,
you got to.

1559
01:39:03,960 --> 01:39:06,900
I guess it's just because
your name is Clanton.

1560
01:39:16,340 --> 01:39:17,740
Ike sent me to see you.

1561
01:39:17,780 --> 01:39:20,110
He wants to meet with you
and your family, personal.

1562
01:39:20,150 --> 01:39:21,640
I’ve been expecting it.

1563
01:39:21,680 --> 01:39:23,080
With no interference
from Clum.

1564
01:39:23,120 --> 01:39:24,480
You have my word.

1565
01:39:24,520 --> 01:39:25,820
How many men is he bringing?

1566
01:39:25,850 --> 01:39:28,180
Six.

1567
01:39:28,260 --> 01:39:30,750
There'll be Ike
and Finn and...

1568
01:39:30,790 --> 01:39:32,090
Ringo and the McLowerys.

1569
01:39:32,130 --> 01:39:33,920
Where and when?

1570
01:39:33,960 --> 01:39:35,590
Sunup at OK Corral.

1571
01:39:35,630 --> 01:39:37,720
You tell Ike
we'll be there.

1572
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:40,030
You said six.

1573
01:39:40,070 --> 01:39:42,730
I’ll be coming with 'em.

1574
01:39:42,770 --> 01:39:45,200
Don't do it, Billy.

1575
01:39:45,240 --> 01:39:47,640
Give yourself
a chance to live.

1576
01:39:50,340 --> 01:39:52,370
No, I thought about it.

1577
01:39:54,310 --> 01:39:55,980
I thought
real hard about it.

1578
01:39:59,490 --> 01:40:02,790
No, sir, I can't run.

1579
01:40:02,820 --> 01:40:04,920
Ike and Finn are my brothers.

1580
01:40:08,500 --> 01:40:10,860
You understand that,
don't you?

1581
01:40:12,630 --> 01:40:14,360
Yes, Billy,
I understand that.

1582
01:40:24,240 --> 01:40:26,840
How can you sit there
like you're playing checkers?

1583
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:28,640
How can you sit there like that?

1584
01:40:30,750 --> 01:40:32,240
What's the matter with you?

1585
01:40:32,290 --> 01:40:35,220
Why don't you go to John Clum
and ask for some help?

1586
01:40:35,260 --> 01:40:37,920
I told you,
this is not Clum's affair.

1587
01:40:37,960 --> 01:40:39,760
This is personal,

1588
01:40:39,790 --> 01:40:41,660
between us and...
Ike Clanton.

1589
01:40:41,700 --> 01:40:43,750
But you're lawmen...

1590
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:45,790
you are lawmen,
all three of you.

1591
01:40:45,830 --> 01:40:47,800
You have no right
to put yourselves

1592
01:40:47,830 --> 01:40:49,560
above the safety of this town.

1593
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:52,570
not to your own pride.

1594
01:40:54,370 --> 01:40:57,430
Proud, proud men.

1595
01:40:57,480 --> 01:41:02,410
Look at you...
look at the proud men.

1596
01:41:02,450 --> 01:41:07,580
Morgan, does your wife know
she'll be a widow tomorrow?

1597
01:41:09,190 --> 01:41:11,210
I think you'd better
leave the room.

1598
01:41:23,370 --> 01:41:26,930
Virgil, your son wants
to kiss you goodnight.

1599
01:41:35,950 --> 01:41:37,110
See you in the morning.

1600
01:42:57,330 --> 01:43:00,930
Doc, wake up.

1601
01:43:00,970 --> 01:43:04,840
Doc, it's me, Wyatt.

1602
01:43:04,870 --> 01:43:06,100
Wake up, do you hear me?

1603
01:43:17,680 --> 01:43:20,920
You drunken sot.

1604
01:43:20,950 --> 01:43:22,650
I need you, Doc.

1605
01:43:22,690 --> 01:43:25,450
Don't let me down.

1606
01:43:25,490 --> 01:43:27,120
Wake up, do you hear me?!
Wake up!

1607
01:43:27,160 --> 01:43:28,590
Leave him alone.

1608
01:43:30,230 --> 01:43:32,490
Can't you see he's dying?

1609
01:45:12,200 --> 01:45:14,190
Leave them alone.

1610
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:21,430
Doc.

1611
01:45:21,470 --> 01:45:23,140
How do you feel?

1612
01:45:23,180 --> 01:45:25,580
The fight's this morning...

1613
01:45:25,610 --> 01:45:27,200
isn't it?

1614
01:45:27,310 --> 01:45:29,800
Well...

1615
01:45:29,850 --> 01:45:31,610
I don’t know.

1616
01:45:37,060 --> 01:45:40,490
Doc, you can't.

1617
01:45:40,530 --> 01:45:42,260
You can't.

1618
01:45:45,130 --> 01:45:47,330
Doc, you can't!

1619
01:45:47,370 --> 01:45:48,490
You can't even stand up!

1620
01:45:52,140 --> 01:45:55,070
You're going to die for sure,
if you go out there.

1621
01:45:58,810 --> 01:46:00,800
If I’m going to die,

1622
01:46:00,850 --> 01:46:03,480
at least let me die with
the only friend I ever had.

1623
01:46:04,720 --> 01:46:07,520
We don't make
no difference, huh?

1624
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:12,820
You and I...

1625
01:46:12,860 --> 01:46:14,920
we don't matter, Kate.

1626
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:17,760
We haven't mattered
since the day we were born.

1627
01:47:17,360 --> 01:47:19,020
Get the horses around back.

1628
01:47:19,060 --> 01:47:20,050
All right.

1629
01:47:30,500 --> 01:47:31,900
Get going, Cotton.

1630
01:47:39,650 --> 01:47:40,770
Frank.

1631
01:47:40,810 --> 01:47:43,080
Take the rifle,
get inside the wagon.

1632
01:47:43,120 --> 01:47:44,380
Up front.

1633
01:48:16,020 --> 01:48:18,450
Morgan and Virgil
are waiting.

1634
01:50:00,690 --> 01:50:03,210
Ike wants to talk to you alone.

1635
01:50:03,320 --> 01:50:04,310
He's unarmed.

1636
01:50:04,360 --> 01:50:06,660
Wait a minute, Wyatt.

1637
01:50:06,690 --> 01:50:09,090
Kate told me about
the killing of your brother.

1638
01:50:09,130 --> 01:50:11,220
It was the Clantons
all right...

1639
01:50:11,330 --> 01:50:12,490
and you were in on it.

1640
01:50:12,530 --> 01:50:14,000
I had nothing to do with it.

1641
01:50:14,030 --> 01:50:15,330
Get back where you belong.

1642
01:50:15,370 --> 01:50:16,230
Believe me, Wyatt...

1643
01:50:16,340 --> 01:50:17,890
Get back with your friends.

1644
01:50:23,540 --> 01:50:25,170
They're coming.

1645
01:50:34,020 --> 01:50:36,250
They got Doc Holliday
with them.

1646
01:50:36,290 --> 01:50:38,260
Holliday, huh?

1647
01:50:38,290 --> 01:50:40,950
Cotton, you get over
with the horses.

1648
01:50:40,990 --> 01:50:42,150
Ike...

1649
01:50:42,200 --> 01:50:44,430
I can't take this kind
of gunplay anymore.

1650
01:50:44,460 --> 01:50:45,450
Let me out.

1651
01:50:45,500 --> 01:50:47,260
Get over there.

1652
01:51:26,510 --> 01:51:27,670
Seven of them, with Cotton.

1653
01:51:27,710 --> 01:51:28,970
I only see six.

1654
01:51:32,510 --> 01:51:33,670
Spread.

1655
01:51:49,260 --> 01:51:50,590
Frank...

1656
01:51:52,300 --> 01:51:53,290
Hit the dirt!

1657
01:52:12,250 --> 01:52:13,880
Cover me.

1658
01:52:19,790 --> 01:52:21,260
Shotgun!

1659
01:53:28,690 --> 01:53:29,680
You all right?

1660
01:53:29,730 --> 01:53:30,720
All right...

1661
01:53:30,760 --> 01:53:31,920
All right.

1662
01:54:08,970 --> 01:54:11,370
Cotton, you chicken-livered,
miserable...

1663
01:54:28,350 --> 01:54:29,840
They killed my brother!

1664
01:54:29,890 --> 01:54:30,980
Tom, stay back, you fool!

1665
01:54:31,020 --> 01:54:32,050
They killed my brother!

1666
01:54:38,900 --> 01:54:39,830
Come on, Earp!

1667
01:54:39,870 --> 01:54:40,850
I’ll kill you!

1668
01:54:43,200 --> 01:54:45,140
Come out and get it, Earp!

1669
01:54:45,170 --> 01:54:46,160
Earp! Come out and get it!

1670
01:55:22,480 --> 01:55:23,570
Virg.

1671
01:55:23,610 --> 01:55:24,600
Hurt bad?

1672
01:55:24,640 --> 01:55:26,130
Yeah, my le... my legs.

1673
01:56:16,360 --> 01:56:17,350
Doc?

1674
01:56:22,500 --> 01:56:24,660
I’ll take care of Ringo.

1675
01:58:24,420 --> 01:58:26,120
Billy?

1676
01:58:26,160 --> 01:58:28,180
Throw down your gun
and come on out.

1677
01:58:31,500 --> 01:58:34,690
Give up, boy,
you haven't got a chance!

1678
01:58:38,040 --> 01:58:41,030
Come in and get me.
Come in and get me!

1679
01:58:53,020 --> 01:58:55,950
Don't make me do it, boy.

1680
01:58:55,990 --> 01:58:57,460
Don't make me do it.

1681
02:00:26,650 --> 02:00:28,770
I’m shoving off, Doc.

1682
02:00:28,810 --> 02:00:31,080
How are the brothers?

1683
02:00:31,120 --> 02:00:32,880
Coming along fine.

1684
02:00:32,920 --> 02:00:35,390
They're going
to be all right.

1685
02:00:35,420 --> 02:00:37,050
Another glass, Joe.

1686
02:00:43,860 --> 02:00:44,950
I just want you to know

1687
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:46,930
I’d have never made it
without you.

1688
02:00:48,900 --> 02:00:50,060
Where are you heading?

1689
02:00:50,100 --> 02:00:51,830
California.

1690
02:00:51,870 --> 02:00:53,800
Laura?

1691
02:00:53,840 --> 02:00:55,640
I don’t know;
I hope so.

1692
02:00:55,670 --> 02:00:57,640
She'll be waiting.

1693
02:01:00,750 --> 02:01:03,010
Will you listen to me
for just once?

1694
02:01:03,050 --> 02:01:04,810
Will you get up
to that hospital in Denver?

1695
02:01:04,850 --> 02:01:06,010
At this rate,

1696
02:01:06,050 --> 02:01:07,950
you can't last more
than a couple of months.

1697
02:01:07,990 --> 02:01:08,950
You crazy?

1698
02:01:08,990 --> 02:01:10,580
And give up
this winning streak?

1699
02:01:16,960 --> 02:01:18,830
I’ll see you around.

1700
02:01:18,860 --> 02:01:21,130
So long, preacher.

1701
02:01:38,720 --> 02:01:39,840
Good afternoon,
gentlemen.

1702
02:01:39,890 --> 02:01:40,850
Hello, Doc.

1703
02:01:40,890 --> 02:01:41,850
Hi, Doc.

1704
02:01:41,890 --> 02:01:43,080
