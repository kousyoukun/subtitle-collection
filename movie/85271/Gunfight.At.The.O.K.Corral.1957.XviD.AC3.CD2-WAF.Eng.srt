1
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,710
Keep moving, come on.

2
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:18,611
Kelly, take them down

3
00:00:18,651 --> 00:00:20,016
and lock them up
for the night.

4
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:21,680
You heard the marshal.

5
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:23,484
Come on,
let's get moving!

6
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:29,095
I don't suppose
you want my thanks.

7
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:31,689
Let's just say
my account is paid in full.

8
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:34,461
And don't take it
personal, Marshal.

9
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,246
Mornin', Doc.

10
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:58,689
Good morning.

11
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,190
Just thought
you'd like to know,

12
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,664
there's going to be

13
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,428
one less lawman
in the territory.

14
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:09,992
That's always
good news to me.

15
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:11,560
I'm heading
for California,

16
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:14,038
buying a ranch,
taking your good advice...

17
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:15,938
getting out
while there's time.

18
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:17,033
Smart man.

19
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,078
Laura's coming with me.

20
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:22,240
We're getting married
in a few days.

21
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:24,978
We'd like you to come
to the wedding, Doc,

22
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:27,418
if it doesn't interfere
with your poker.

23
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:29,718
I'm not good at weddings,
only funerals.

24
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:31,347
Deal me out.

25
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,693
Wyatt...

26
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:40,358
You know,
she's a real lady.

27
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,595
I wish you both
a lot of happiness.

28
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:44,466
Ah, you're lucky

29
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:46,630
to be getting out
of this country.

30
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:48,903
Why don't you try your luck?

31
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:51,874
Mmm...

32
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:55,740
So long, Doc.

33
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:15,031
Take me back, Doc?

34
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:17,729
Please?

35
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:22,034
Give me another chance.

36
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:31,410
Please, take me back.

37
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,817
I'll do anything you say.

38
00:02:36,155 --> 00:02:37,952
I don't care how you treat me.

39
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:43,022
Doc, I'm sorry for what I done.

40
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:44,825
It's not your fault, Kate.

41
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,627
It's not my fault.

42
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,293
It's not anybody's fault.

43
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:51,360
It's just the way
the cards fall.

44
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,841
Never gave you
much of a chance, did I?

45
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:02,274
Well, maybe
it could have been different

46
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:03,942
if I was right to you, but...

47
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:05,974
It ain't too late, Doc.

48
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,783
I'll be good to you, I promise.

49
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:10,516
It's too late for both of us.

50
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:12,388
Do something better
for yourself

51
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:14,188
while you've still
got the chance.

52
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:30,842
Don't let me go, Doc.

53
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,708
Don't let me go back there.

54
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:34,337
Leave me alone,

55
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,938
just... leave me alone.

56
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:48,560
I'll see you dead.

57
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:08,646
Hiya, Wyatt.

58
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:09,841
Charlie.

59
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:11,008
You got a letter

60
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,312
from the Attorney General.

61
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:13,376
What's he got to say?

62
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,759
He says he can get you an
appointment as U.S. Marshal

63
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:23,261
anytime you want it.

64
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:25,890
"Wyatt Earp, United
States marshal"...

65
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,763
that's all I need.

66
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,927
These are all dead, Charlie.

67
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:32,335
Oh, before I forget...

68
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:34,669
This is yours now.

69
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:37,367
I'm through as
a lawman for good.

70
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:40,879
Oh, you got
a telegram, too.

71
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:42,744
Read it.

72
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,600
Virgil's my brother.

73
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:12,736
He's in trouble, he needs me.

74
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,609
Try to understand, Laura.

75
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:17,445
I understand I was foolish
to fall in love.

76
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,882
Oh, if only I could...

77
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:20,215
Wyatt, when
I first met you,

78
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:21,652
I told you
I wouldn't follow you

79
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:23,745
from town to town,
sitting in the darkness,

80
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,554
waiting for someone to bring
the news you've been killed;

81
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:27,923
I won't live that way.

82
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,587
We're not going to
start a life together

83
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:30,596
with a gun in your hand.

84
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,597
I swear to you, Laura,

85
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:32,791
I'm through after Tombstone.

86
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,163
You'll never be through.

87
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:36,633
Your reputation will follow you
wherever you are.

88
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:37,761
Laura, he's my brother...

89
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,065
And I'm to be your wife.

90
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:40,765
Don't ask me
to let him down.

91
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,637
Don't let me down.

92
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:45,542
I'd give up anything,
I'd go anywhere for you.

93
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:47,637
I'll work beside you
in the fields.

94
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,080
But you've got
to meet me halfway.

95
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:11,397
I must go to Tombstone.

96
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:15,601
All right, go,
clean up Tombstone.

97
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:19,042
There's a hundred more
Tombstones on the frontier,

98
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:21,979
all waiting for
the great Wyatt Earp.

99
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:24,005
Go on, clean them all up.

100
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,711
Go on!

101
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,779
I love you, Laura.

102
00:06:58,351 --> 00:06:59,818
I love you, Wyatt.

103
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:15,857
Ride on... ride on...

104
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:20,965
To hell... and gone...

105
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,602
Wyatt's heart was sad;
he'd give all he had

106
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:30,307
To stay... stay on...

107
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:35,309
Wyatt's lady fair,
he left her crying there

108
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:40,758
He broke his vow
and rode away to Tombstone.

109
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:57,041
Good afternoon, Marshal.

110
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:58,338
Out for a little ride?

111
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:00,208
About 700-miles-worth:
Tombstone.

112
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:01,804
Tombstone, huh?

113
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:03,543
I was headin'
that way myself.

114
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,414
Understand the climate
down there

115
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:06,975
may be better for my cough.

116
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:08,577
Since when have you
gotten interested in the health

117
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,650
Well, it's really
a matter of finances;

118
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:14,057
the deck's gone cold here,
nobody'll give me any play.

119
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:16,118
Mind if I ride along?

120
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,221
It's a free country,
hop on.

121
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:20,290
Where's your gear?

122
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:26,338
Boot Hill

123
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:27,339
On a hill, on a hill

124
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:28,601
Boot Hill

125
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,107
In the air, there's a chill,
there's a chill

126
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:31,370
So cold

127
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,468
Mighty cold, mighty cold,
mighty cold

128
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,671
So still

129
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:35,180
Mighty still, mighty still,
mighty still

130
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:38,945
Will the Doc and his friend,
will both of them end

131
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:44,184
In the graveyard
that's known as Boot Hill?

132
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:36,241
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

133
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:42,376
Well, thanks
for the ride.

134
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,349
Sell my horse,
and get a good price.

135
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:48,986
Doc.

136
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:52,354
I know, no knives,
no guns, no killing, huh?

137
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,660
Man, that's good.

138
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:06,569
I just about forgot what
a home-cooked meal tastes like.

139
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,937
Betty, I'm going to steal you
away from Virgil.

140
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:10,168
By golly, Wyatt,

141
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:12,073
you're going to be
the only single one left.

142
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,635
I got a family going
in Deadwood.

143
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,408
Even little Jimmy here
is tying the knot

144
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,938
when he gets back
to California.

145
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:19,041
What do you mean,
"Little Jimmy"?

146
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:20,609
I'll be 19 next month.

147
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:22,916
Nineteen.

148
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:27,626
Say, when are you going
to get hitched, Wyatt?

149
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:32,688
Cigar?

150
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:34,529
There's the signal

151
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,967
for women and children
to leave the room.

152
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:39,267
Come on, Tommy,
it's your bedtime now.

153
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:40,862
Oh, Mom, do I have to?

154
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,964
Yes, you do.

155
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,668
Your uncles
will all be here tomorrow.

156
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:45,040
Good night, Uncle Wyatt.

157
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:46,044
Good night, Tommy.

158
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:47,238
Good night, Uncle Morgan.

159
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,473
Good night, son.

160
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:49,640
Good night, Uncle James.

161
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:50,807
Good night, Tommy.

162
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:51,942
Good night, Daddy.

163
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:52,973
Good night, son.

164
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:58,422
It's nice to have you here.

165
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:02,018
I only wish it were under
happier circumstances.

166
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:13,365
She seems pretty upset.

167
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:15,464
Well, she's been
asking me for a year

168
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:16,667
to quit marshaling.

169
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:18,436
You know how women are.

170
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:23,114
All right, now let's
get down to business.

171
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:25,709
Now, Morgan and Jimmy
know the setup here.

172
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:27,308
Now, Wyatt,
you know lke Clanton.

173
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,945
He has a ranch outside
city limits.

174
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:30,250
Yes, I know.

175
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:32,814
He's organized the toughest
bunch of gunslingers

176
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,189
you ever laid eyes on,

177
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:35,853
and he owns the county sheriff.

178
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:36,862
Who is he?

179
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:37,988
Cotton Wilson.

180
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,156
Cotton Wilson.

181
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,927
So lke paid off on his deed.

182
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:44,367
Clanton's been rustling
Mexican cattle by the thousands.

183
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:45,771
And he has to move them,

184
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:48,103
but he can only ship them out
of Tombstone,

185
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:50,802
and he can't do that
while we control the city.

186
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,309
That's about it.

187
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:54,505
He's organized
and he's mean.

188
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,515
We can't keep him out
of Tombstone forever.

189
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,176
What about the people
of Tombstone?

190
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,946
John Clum,
editor of the "Epitaph,"

191
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:02,453
and some of the leading citizens
will back us

192
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,615
if they know
you're calling the shots.

193
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:07,649
We're all agreed, Wyatt,
you should run the show.

194
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:16,526
There's only one thing
that bothers me

195
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,538
and I'm going to
speak my piece now.

196
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:22,166
There's going to be
a lot of bad talk

197
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,709
about you riding
with Doc Holliday.

198
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:26,574
What about
Holliday?

199
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:28,637
He's the worst killer
on the frontier,

200
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:29,908
that's what about him.

201
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:34,545
It just don't look good,
you coming here with him.

202
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,612
Holliday saved my life
in Dodge City;

203
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:37,713
I don't forget that.

204
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:39,916
What's more,
he's a man of his word.

205
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,893
As long as he plays
his cards straight

206
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,189
and keeps out of killings,

207
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:45,197
we got no right to run him
out of town.

208
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:46,823
I didn't know you
two were a team.

209
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:47,798
We're not.

210
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,425
It's just a case
of square deal.

211
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:51,470
Holliday stays.

212
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:54,200
All right, Wyatt,
he's your responsibility.

213
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,399
That suits me fine.

214
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:57,806
Now, do we have a map
of the county here?

215
00:12:57,843 --> 00:12:59,777
Now, the first thing
we got to do

216
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:03,179
is let the Clantons know
that the city is closed to them.

217
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:05,274
Then we got to control
the county.

218
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:06,648
Now, that's important.

219
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:08,414
I'm going to get a letter off
to a man tonight

220
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,183
who'll take care of that
little matter for us.

221
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:11,746
Now, show me where
the Clanton ranch is.

222
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,779
Here.

223
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:26,294
Hello, Cotton, I've
been expecting you.

224
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:27,430
You're looking fine.

225
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:29,133
Real prosperous.

226
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:30,608
Oh, I ain't complaining.

227
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,167
What's on your mind?

228
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:35,008
Wyatt, lke wants
to make you a deal.

229
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:36,309
He promises no trouble

230
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:38,714
if you'll let him ship
his cattle out of Tombstone.

231
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:40,309
Well, that's mighty
nice of lke.

232
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:41,444
Ike is a nice fella.

233
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,455
He's got a fortune
tied up in cattle

234
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,717
out there at the ranch,

235
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:46,347
and he's going
to move them.

236
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:48,326
Oh, he is, huh?

237
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:58,365
There's $20,000
in it for you... cash.

238
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:02,204
$20,000.

239
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:03,970
The wages of sin are rising.

240
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:07,342
$20,000 against
a six-foot hole in Boot Hill,

241
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:08,778
or a $20-a-month pension

242
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:11,078
if you live long enough
to collect it.

243
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:18,518
I've thought
about those things.

244
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:27,064
You know, Cotton,

245
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:29,226
this is a nice little town.

246
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:30,860
A good place to set awhile.

247
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:34,303
I might even run for county
sheriff in a couple of months.

248
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,637
That don't scare me at all.

249
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,198
I got mine.

250
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:39,608
I got a ranch now
and $25,000 in the bank.

251
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:40,907
And you know something?

252
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:43,073
It don't bother my sleep,
not one bit.

253
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:44,548
It would mine, though.

254
00:14:45,884 --> 00:14:48,216
Why don't you get off
that pulpit, Wyatt?

255
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:49,744
Ellsworth, Wichita,
Dodge City,

256
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:52,222
and what have they got you
but a life full of misery

257
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:53,748
and a woman who
walked out on you

258
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:55,259
and the friendship
of a killer.

259
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,291
Take this message back
to your boss.

260
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:15,272
So that's the way
he wants it, huh?

261
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:18,215
He aims to pull the town
out from under you, lke.

262
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:29,054
I immediately raised my hat

263
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:32,621
And finally she remarked:

264
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:36,066
"I never shall forget

265
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:40,196
That lovely afternoon"

266
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:43,834
I met her at the fountain
in the park.

267
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:50,782
A long time, lke.

268
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:51,908
Too long.

269
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,247
Hello, Ringo.

270
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,980
Still renting your gun
to the highest bidder?

271
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,453
That's right, Marshal.

272
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,721
Ain't you a little young
to be packing a gun, son?

273
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,659
Why don't you try me?

274
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:09,256
Going someplace?

275
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,098
We're taking in the show, Marshal.

276
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,364
Any objections?

277
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:14,599
No, as soon as you check in
your side arms.

278
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:17,005
Why don't you check it in
for me, Marshal?

279
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:20,000
Stop!

280
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:23,645
You boys know my brothers.

281
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:26,515
Meet John Clum,
head of the Citizens' Committee.

282
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:28,782
You're a marked man, Wyatt.

283
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,187
There's no place in
this town for you, lke.

284
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:32,656
The next time
you ride in armed,

285
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:33,884
you ride out feet first.

286
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:36,854
Now get moving.

287
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:28,442
Here comes trouble.

288
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,505
Who is she?

289
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:31,640
She's Kate Fisher.

290
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,479
She just couldn't stay away.

291
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:41,424
Four blues.

292
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,554
Call them, you suckers.

293
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:46,996
Barkeep, some whiskey
down here.

294
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:49,262
Leave the bottle.

295
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:50,596
Two pairs.

296
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:53,230
Aces up.

297
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:55,364
Hey, Doc, what have you got?

298
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:56,635
Three tres.

299
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,335
Nice town, huh, Kate?

300
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,681
Well, well, well.

301
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:05,649
If it ain't the little deputy.

302
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:12,319
Doc, you deal.

303
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,128
Ain't you gonna say hello
to an old friend?

304
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:19,687
Draw.

305
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,032
Give me some creme de menthe.

306
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:29,871
Hey, little deputy...

307
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,070
would you like to have
another drink with me?

308
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:37,539
You're drunk,
Ringo.

309
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,051
It's the way you made
your reputation, wasn't it...

310
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:41,746
against drunks?

311
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:46,991
Get your gun.

312
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:48,390
I'll meet you in the street

313
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:49,416
in five minutes.

314
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,224
I'll be there.

315
00:18:57,736 --> 00:18:59,567
I said I'd see you dead.

316
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:22,160
What kind of a sucker play
is this?

317
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:24,389
It's all Clanton needs
to start a war.

318
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:25,862
Look, I've had it up to here.

319
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:28,423
If you want to play patty-cake
with him, go ahead.

320
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:30,660
Give me your gun, Doc.

321
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:32,397
You've got no right packing it.

322
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:40,778
Now, you can...

323
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:43,780
you can thank God
you're Wyatt Earp's brother.

324
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:47,216
Holliday, if you think
anything about Wyatt,

325
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:49,015
you'll get out of here.

326
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:50,544
Having a killer like you around

327
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:52,648
is the worst thing
that can happen to him.

328
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:43,770
I hear you're leaving Tombstone.

329
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:45,969
You hear good.

330
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:47,944
I'm taking the stage tomorrow.

331
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:53,916
I kind of thought this climate

332
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:55,078
was good for your cough.

333
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,348
Listen, preacher,

334
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:59,915
being here has caused me
a lot of embarrassment.

335
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,552
Some people are even taking me as a lawman.

336
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:06,331
You're not leaving on my account?

337
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:09,664
Your account?

338
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:11,930
You've got nothing to do
with my leaving.

339
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:25,983
Good luck, Doc.

340
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:40,327
Too bad we won't be in on the finish together.

341
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:51,602
Hi, Wyatt.

342
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,804
Here's that letter
you've been waiting for.

343
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:10,085
Who do we got here?

344
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:11,652
Young Clanton
passed out drunk

345
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:12,755
at the Alhambra.

346
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:15,460
Throw him in the tank
and let him sleep it off.

347
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:17,024
Hold it a minute.

348
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:20,164
John, how long
is it going to take you

349
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:21,705
to get those men
you promised me?

350
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,207
Anytime you say.

351
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:25,835
I think I'll take a little trip
out to the Clanton ranch.

352
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:26,844
Are you crazy?!

353
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:28,004
I don't think so.

354
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:29,206
Well, take your gun.

355
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:31,078
This is all the ammunition
I'll need.

356
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:38,816
If I'm not back
in a couple of hours, Virg,

357
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:41,826
have Clum's Citizens' Committee
drag my carcass out.

358
00:22:58,643 --> 00:23:00,372
Whoa, whoa.

359
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:54,196
Billy!

360
00:23:54,232 --> 00:23:55,597
He's all right, ma'am,

361
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,395
just got himself
a little liquored up.

362
00:23:57,435 --> 00:23:58,629
All right, on your feet.

363
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,240
Billy! You get in the house.

364
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:26,387
I don't know what I'm going
to do with that boy.

365
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:27,898
Way he's going now,

366
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:29,992
he's going to end up
like his father,

367
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:31,730
shot down
for stealing cattle.

368
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:37,935
You think
you're pretty tough,

369
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,466
don't you, son?

370
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:41,068
I never saw a gunslinger yet

371
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,944
so tough he lived to celebrate
his 35th birthday.

372
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:49,850
I learned one rule
about gunslingers:

373
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:51,321
There's always a man

374
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:53,051
faster on the draw
than you are,

375
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:54,786
and the more you use a gun

376
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:57,056
the sooner you're going
to run into that man.

377
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:02,824
You think I don't know
what's inside of you.

378
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:04,994
I had a couple
of big brothers.

379
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:08,733
They fought in the Civil War
and I was too young to go.

380
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:10,604
I tried to live up
to them the same way

381
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:12,801
you're trying to live up
to lke and Finn.

382
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:18,942
You know about that, huh?

383
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:20,918
You can bet I know about that.

384
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:23,944
It's not that I want
to be a gunfighter, exactly.

385
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:27,117
It's just... I don't know,
sometimes I get lonely.

386
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,659
All gunfighters are lonely.

387
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:35,028
They live in fear.

388
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:38,194
They die without a dime
or a woman or a friend.

389
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:40,538
You know, I never
thought about it like that.

390
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:42,438
Well, think about
it, think about it.

391
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:45,637
Billy, listen to the marshal.

392
00:25:49,514 --> 00:25:51,277
I won't do it no more, Ma.

393
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:52,749
Oh, Billy...

394
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:21,903
What are you doin' here?

395
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:25,883
Brought your kid
brother home, drunk.

396
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:29,375
You should be proud,
real proud.

397
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:32,015
You'd better get ridin'.

398
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:39,457
I wouldn't do that, lke.

399
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:42,196
Some of my friends in Tombstone

400
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:44,064
might begin to worry
if I'm not back soon.

401
00:26:44,135 --> 00:26:46,035
That don't cut
no ice with me, Wyatt.

402
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:48,095
You're out of your territory
this time.

403
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:49,663
Am I?

404
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:55,309
My appointment,
United States marshal.

405
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,590
Sorry to
disappoint you.

406
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:09,820
Now, wait a minute, Wyatt,

407
00:27:09,861 --> 00:27:11,055
I'm not lookin' for a fight,

408
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:12,461
but you got
to stop pushin' me.

409
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:14,397
Now, why don't we sit down
and talk it over?

410
00:27:14,432 --> 00:27:16,093
I'll make you
any kind of deal you ask.

411
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:17,602
The only deal I want

412
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:19,104
is for you to run
that stolen herd

413
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:20,571
back to Mexico.

414
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:21,799
Hyah!

415
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,788
Did you see the judge?

416
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,190
I seen him.

417
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:43,660
Well?

418
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:45,662
There's no legal way
you can keep

419
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:48,188
a United States marshal
out of the county.

420
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:51,031
Judge was packin' up
to leave when I got there.

421
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:54,664
I think it's about time
we all pack up and leave, lke.

422
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:55,706
Shut up, Frank.

423
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,298
Only one thing we can do.

424
00:27:57,375 --> 00:28:00,867
We didn't have no trouble
till that Wyatt Earp got here.

425
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:04,676
You're makin' sense now, lke.

426
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:07,651
All right... we got no choice.

427
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:09,312
We'll ambush him tonight.

428
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,845
Ain't you forgettin'
about the rest of the Earps?

429
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,824
Now, look,
we can handle the Earps

430
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,723
if we make this
a personal fight.

431
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:17,261
What if they bring in Clum?!

432
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:19,195
They won't, they're too proud.

433
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:22,028
They're going to come to us
the way we want.

434
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:28,097
It's a law... bigger than any law
on the books... family pride.

435
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:31,108
We'll get that Wyatt
when he makes his late round.

436
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,041
Don't make no difference to me.

437
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,654
Tired?

438
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:54,755
Yeah, I guess I must
have dozed a little.

439
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,391
Betty sent some coffee.

440
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:58,129
Well, that's going
to hit the spot.

441
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:05,634
It's awful quiet.

442
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:08,339
Too quiet.

443
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:15,385
Wyatt, do you figure we're going
to have to fight it out

444
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,409
with the Clantons?

445
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,715
I wish I knew, Jimmy.

446
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:23,658
Maybe lke will see how hopeless it all is.

447
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:32,969
You itching to get back to California?

448
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:34,527
I think about it
all the time.

449
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:37,731
She must be quite a girl.

450
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:39,140
Yes, she is.

451
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:42,646
Well...

452
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,671
I better get to work.

453
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:47,282
Look, how about letting me

454
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:49,013
make the rounds
for you tonight?

455
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:50,816
I get awful
lonesome sitting here

456
00:29:50,855 --> 00:29:52,447
with nothing to do but think.

457
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:53,923
Sure, you go ahead.

458
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:55,653
I could use some sleep.

459
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,227
At least,
when I'm making the rounds,

460
00:29:57,262 --> 00:29:59,127
it gives me something else
to think about.

461
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:14,090
Ike's called the play.

462
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:15,963
We'll do it his way now.

463
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:18,059
Don't do that, Wyatt,
that's what they want.

464
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:20,297
Don't let them push you
into a personal fight.

465
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:22,067
That's mighty funny
coming from you.

466
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,266
You're a lawman, Wyatt...

467
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:25,036
don't throw away
a lifetime's work.

468
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:26,065
Where's your logic?

469
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:27,509
To hell with logic.

470
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:30,013
That's my brother
lying there.

471
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:12,656
Who is it?

472
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:14,658
Open the door!

473
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:27,704
Start talkin', Kate.

474
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:30,537
Doc... I don't know
nothin' about it.

475
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:31,735
Talk.

476
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:36,038
Why?

477
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:40,741
What difference
does it make now?

478
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:44,949
I sure messed everything up
real good, ain't I?

479
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:51,152
I wanted you back,
and because I love you...

480
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:53,163
and... I...

481
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:55,461
I thought if Wyatt
was out of the way

482
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,365
you'd come back to me.

483
00:33:57,402 --> 00:34:01,065
And that's... that's
why I kept quiet when I...

484
00:34:01,105 --> 00:34:03,335
when I heard them.

485
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:05,933
I must have been out of my mind.

486
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,204
Where?

487
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:11,744
The Clanton ranch.

488
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:14,217
Who was there?

489
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:16,413
I didn't want that boy
to be killed!

490
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:18,888
Who was there?

491
00:34:18,923 --> 00:34:25,658
Lke, the kid... Cotton Wilson
and the McLowerys.

492
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:27,186
And Ringo?

493
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,224
Was Ringo there?!

494
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:34,864
Yes...
Ringo was there.

495
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:39,666
No, Doc...

496
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,109
Don't, Doc.

497
00:34:41,145 --> 00:34:43,045
Don't, please don't, Doc.

498
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:45,549
Doc!

499
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:05,599
Please don't, Doc.

500
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,262
Please don't kill me.

501
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:08,397
Please...

502
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:09,804
Please!

503
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:11,308
Please!

504
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:13,810
Don't kill me!

505
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:05,386
Doc?

506
00:36:06,564 --> 00:36:07,792
Doc!

507
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,496
Doc!

508
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:16,373
Oh, Doc.

509
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:19,976
It's all right, honey.

510
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,876
It's all right, honey.

511
00:36:32,623 --> 00:36:33,647
Wyatt?

512
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:36,023
Lke sent me.

513
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,525
I didn't have nothin'
to do with it.

514
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:46,832
I didn't know
nothin' about...

515
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:48,303
You got to believe me,
you got to.

516
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:51,307
I guess it's just because
your name is Clanton.

517
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:02,150
Ike sent me to see you.

518
00:37:02,186 --> 00:37:04,518
He wants to meet with you
and your family, personal.

519
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,045
I've been expecting it.

520
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:07,489
With no interference from Clum.

521
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:08,890
You have my word.

522
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:10,223
How many men is he bringing?

523
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:12,593
Six.

524
00:37:12,663 --> 00:37:15,154
There'll be lke and Finn and...

525
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:16,496
Ringo and the McLowerys.

526
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:18,331
Where and when?

527
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:19,994
Sunup at OK Corral.

528
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,130
You tell lke
we'll be there.

529
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:24,470
You said six.

530
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:27,170
I'll be coming with 'em.

531
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:29,645
Don't do it, Billy.

532
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,080
Give yourself
a chance to live.

533
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:36,810
No, I thought about it.

534
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,417
I thought
real hard about it.

535
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:47,227
No, sir, I can't run.

536
00:37:47,264 --> 00:37:49,357
Ike and Finn are my brothers.

537
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,337
You understand that,
don't you?

538
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,837
Yes, Billy,
I understand that.

539
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:11,313
How can you sit there
like you're playing checkers?

540
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:13,118
How can you sit there like that?

541
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:16,716
What's the matter with you?

542
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:19,696
Why don't you go to John Clum
and ask for some help?

543
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:22,392
I told you,
this is not Clum's affair.

544
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:24,230
This is personal,

545
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:26,170
between us and...
Ike Clanton.

546
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:28,229
But you're lawmen...

547
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:30,263
you are lawmen,
all three of you.

548
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:32,309
You have no right
to put yourselves

549
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:34,072
above the safety of this town.

550
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:37,080
Your duty is to the people,
not to your own pride.

551
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:41,943
Proud, proud men.

552
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:46,923
Look at you...
Iook at the proud men.

553
00:38:46,957 --> 00:38:52,020
Morgan, does your wife know
she'll be a widow tomorrow?

554
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:55,656
I think you'd better
leave the room.

555
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:11,406
Virgil, your son wants
to kiss you goodnight.

556
00:39:20,424 --> 00:39:21,584
See you in the morning.

557
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:45,400
Doc, wake up.

558
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:49,276
Doc, it's me, Wyatt.

559
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:50,541
Wake up, do you hear me?

560
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:05,357
You drunken sot.

561
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:07,091
I need you, Doc.

562
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,895
Don't let me down.

563
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:11,561
Wake up, do you hear me?!
Wake up!

564
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:13,034
Leave him alone.

565
00:41:14,705 --> 00:41:16,935
Can't you see he's dying?

566
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,608
Leave them alone.

567
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:05,873
Doc.

568
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:07,577
How do you feel?

569
00:43:07,618 --> 00:43:10,018
The fight's this morning...

570
00:43:10,054 --> 00:43:11,646
isn't it?

571
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:14,246
Well...

572
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:16,054
I don't know.

573
00:43:21,498 --> 00:43:24,934
Doc, you can't.

574
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:26,698
You can't.

575
00:43:29,606 --> 00:43:31,767
Doc, you can't!

576
00:43:31,842 --> 00:43:32,934
You can't even stand up!

577
00:43:36,613 --> 00:43:39,548
You're going to die for sure,
if you go out there.

578
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:45,278
If I'm going to die,

579
00:43:45,322 --> 00:43:47,882
at least let me die with
the only friend I ever had.

580
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:51,924
We don't make
no difference, huh?

581
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:57,229
You and I...

582
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:59,326
we don't matter, Kate.

583
00:43:59,403 --> 00:44:02,201
We haven't mattered
since the day we were born.

584
00:45:01,765 --> 00:45:03,426
Get the horses around back.

585
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:04,467
All right.

586
00:45:14,945 --> 00:45:16,344
Get going, Cotton.

587
00:45:24,088 --> 00:45:25,214
Frank.

588
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:27,519
Take the rifle,
get inside the wagon.

589
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:28,820
Up front.

590
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:02,858
Morgan and Virgil
are waiting.

591
00:47:45,128 --> 00:47:47,653
Ike wants to talk to you alone.

592
00:47:47,764 --> 00:47:48,753
He's unarmed.

593
00:47:48,799 --> 00:47:51,097
Wait a minute, Wyatt.

594
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:53,534
Kate told me about
the killing of your brother.

595
00:47:53,604 --> 00:47:55,663
It was the Clantons
all right...

596
00:47:55,806 --> 00:47:56,932
and you were in on it.

597
00:47:57,007 --> 00:47:58,474
I had nothing to do with it.

598
00:47:58,508 --> 00:47:59,805
Get back where you belong.

599
00:47:59,843 --> 00:48:00,707
Believe me, Wyatt...

600
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:02,335
Get back with your friends.

601
00:48:08,018 --> 00:48:09,645
They're coming.

602
00:48:18,495 --> 00:48:20,725
They got Doc Holliday
with them.

603
00:48:20,764 --> 00:48:22,732
Holliday, huh?

604
00:48:22,766 --> 00:48:25,428
Cotton, you get over
with the horses.

605
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:26,629
Ike...

606
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:28,900
I can't take this kind
of gunplay anymore.

607
00:48:28,972 --> 00:48:29,939
Let me out.

608
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:31,770
Get over there.

609
00:49:10,981 --> 00:49:12,141
Seven of them, with Cotton.

610
00:49:12,182 --> 00:49:13,444
I only see six.

611
00:49:16,987 --> 00:49:18,147
Spread.

612
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:35,067
Frank...

613
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:37,774
Hit the dirt!

614
00:49:56,693 --> 00:49:58,320
Cover me.

615
00:50:04,234 --> 00:50:05,724
Shotgun!

616
00:51:13,136 --> 00:51:14,125
You all right?

617
00:51:14,204 --> 00:51:15,171
All right...

618
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:16,364
All right.

619
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:55,810
Cotton, you chicken-livered,
miserable...

620
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:14,286
They killed my brother!

621
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:15,423
Tom, stay back, you fool!

622
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:16,489
They killed my brother!

623
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:24,307
Come on, Earp!

624
00:52:24,341 --> 00:52:25,308
I'll kill you!

625
00:52:27,677 --> 00:52:29,611
Come out and get it, Earp!

626
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:30,635
Earp! Come out and get it!

627
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:08,009
Virg.

628
00:53:08,051 --> 00:53:09,040
Hurt bad?

629
00:53:09,085 --> 00:53:10,575
Yeah, my le... my legs.

630
00:54:00,804 --> 00:54:01,771
Doc?

631
00:54:06,943 --> 00:54:09,104
I'll take care of Ringo.

632
00:56:08,832 --> 00:56:10,527
Billy?

633
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,591
Throw down your gun
and come on out.

634
00:56:15,905 --> 00:56:19,102
Give up, boy,
you haven't got a chance!

635
00:56:22,479 --> 00:56:25,471
Come in and get me.
Come in and get me!

636
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:40,395
Don't make me do it, boy.

637
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:41,897
Don't make me do it.

638
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,247
I'm shoving off, Doc.

639
00:58:13,289 --> 00:58:15,553
How are the brothers?

640
00:58:15,592 --> 00:58:17,355
Coming along fine.

641
00:58:17,393 --> 00:58:19,861
They're going to be all right.

642
00:58:19,896 --> 00:58:21,523
Another glass, Joe.

643
00:58:28,371 --> 00:58:29,429
I just want you to know

644
00:58:29,472 --> 00:58:31,440
I'd have never made it
without you.

645
00:58:33,409 --> 00:58:34,569
Where are you heading?

646
00:58:34,611 --> 00:58:36,340
California.

647
00:58:36,379 --> 00:58:38,313
Laura?

648
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:40,145
I don't know; I hope so.

649
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:42,151
She'll be waiting.

650
00:58:45,255 --> 00:58:47,519
Will you listen to me
for just once?

651
00:58:47,557 --> 00:58:49,252
Will you get up
to that hospital in Denver?

652
00:58:49,292 --> 00:58:50,452
At this rate,

653
00:58:50,493 --> 00:58:52,393
you can't last more
than a couple of months.

654
00:58:52,428 --> 00:58:53,395
You crazy?

655
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:55,021
And give up

What's the name
of this game?

00:59:27,597 --> 00:59:28,586
Boot Hill

663
00:59:28,631 --> 00:59:30,064

In the air, there's a chill,
there's a chill

666
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:33,927
So cold
