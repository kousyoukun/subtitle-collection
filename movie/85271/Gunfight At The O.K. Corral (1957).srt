1
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,434
- Hello, Ed.
- Where's Doc Holliday?

2
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:50,020
Over at the hotel. He's been expecting you...

3
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,231
Get word over there I'm waiting for him.

4
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:56,360
No need to do that, Ed. The whole town
knows you're waiting for him by now.

5
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:59,655
- Before there's another killing...
- Just go on serving your watered-down liquor.

6
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,323
And keep out of my business, Shanssey.

7
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:04,326
Your brother came in here
stinking drunk, spoiling for a fight.

8
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:07,537
- Whiskey. Over there.
- He drew a gun on Holliday.

9
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:12,709
Have it your way, Ed.

10
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:15,045
Check your guns if you wanna stay here.

11
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,936
Leave the bottle.

12
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:36,984
You don't stand a chance, Doc.

13
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:38,819
Bailey brought two men with him.

14
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:42,531
Oh, come on, honey.
Let's cut out of here while there's still time.

15
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:46,785
The whole town, including that
no-good marshal, is laying for you.

16
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:53,458
Right or wrong, they're gonna hang you
for another killing. You know it.

17
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:55,711
Doc.

18
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:59,131
Oh, you ain't even listening to me.

19
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:03,677
Now, Kate, Mr. Bailey
came all the way from Fort Worth...

20
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,637
...to see me on a gentleman's matter.

21
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:06,847
A gentleman. Hmph.

22
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,641
It wouldn't be hospitable for me
to leave town, now, would it?

23
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,977
Don't start that gentleman business
with me again.

24
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,229
It was a pure case of ethics, but...

25
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:19,318
Well, that's something
a person like you wouldn't understand.

26
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:23,488
Why do you always have to treat me
like I'm dirt?

27
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,407
You ain't no better than me.

28
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:28,535
- That's debatable.
- Oh, is it?

29
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:31,288
You and that magnolia dripping.

30
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,248
Let me tell you something, Doc Holliday.

31
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:37,127
All them fancy clothes and that smart talk
don't make you no gentleman.

32
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:40,339
You are dirt, just like me...

33
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:43,925
...and I'm tired of hearing
about that Georgia plantation...

34
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,094
...and all them lily-white friends of yours.

35
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:49,598
They're all gone now. They're all gone!

36
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,353
Yes, they are.

37
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,521
Here I am with you.

38
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,816
Your family scraped the barrel
after the war wiped them out...

39
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:02,694
...just to send you
through dental school. Heh.

40
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,738
You sure turned out fine.

41
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,491
They'd be real proud of you.

42
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:20,337
Don't you ever mention my family again.

43
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,589
Oh, please...

44
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,052
Doc, please.

45
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,013
Forget about Bailey.

46
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:33,100
Let's get out of here while there's still time.

47
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,186
Maybe...

48
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:39,439
Maybe we could even go to Laredo
like you said...

49
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,400
...and do something
about that cough of yours.

50
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,818
It's getting worse all the time.

51
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:45,987
Your concern over my health
touches me deeply.

52
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,823
You know how I feel about you.

53
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,866
I know exactly how you feel.

54
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:55,414
I don't know...

55
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:58,041
I don't know what I'd do
if anything happened to you.

56
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:01,169
You'd lose your meal ticket, wouldn't you?

57
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,381
That ain't nice to say to me, Doc.

58
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,758
I been good to you, ain't I?

59
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:10,011
Why don't you think about me
once in a while?

60
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:17,561
All right, get over to Shanssey's
and tell them I'll be there later.

61
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:20,689
- Please don't go there.
- Do as I tell you.

62
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,573
I need some money.

63
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,763
Hello, Wyatt.

64
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,265
Cotton Wilson.

65
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:40,018
Been a long time.

66
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,189
Man, I'm plain wore out.

67
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,360
Hope you got some good news for me.

68
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,154
Ike Clanton rode through here
three days ago heading east.

69
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,364
Waco, I think.

70
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,990
Johnny Ringo was with him.

71
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:56,451
Rode through heading east?
You didn't get my telegram?

72
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,328
I got it.

73
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,206
Why didn't you hold him?

74
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:05,293
I have no quarrel with Ike Clanton.
Nothing to hold him for.

75
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:09,589
Nothing to hold him for?

76
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:12,175
Why, man,
he's got a dozen charges against him.

77
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:15,011
I played this whole thing
so he'd be forced into Griffin.

78
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:18,181
I figured if there was one man in Texas
who could stop him, you'd be the man.

79
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,892
Now, don't go getting
your blood heated up, Wyatt.

80
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,689
Cotton, it's Wyatt Earp you're talking to.

81
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:29,025
Ten years ago, I watched you walk
single-handed into a saloon in Oklahoma City...

82
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:32,404
...and knock out three of the fastest guns
in the territory.

83
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,532
Ten years is a long time ago.

84
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,784
Getting old, I guess.

85
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:47,294
Anybody ever told me
that Cotton Wilson had gone yellow...

86
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,838
...I'd call him a liar.
- You got no right to say that to me.

87
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,257
I've bucked heads
with the toughest gangs on the frontier.

88
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,927
Then why didn't you stop Ringo and Clanton?
Why didn't you?

89
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,390
If you can't handle it anymore,
turn in your badge.

90
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:07,105
Turn in my badge.

91
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:13,528
I've been a lawman for 25 years.
Worked every hellhole in the territory.

92
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:16,740
You know what I got to show for it?
A $12-a-month room...

93
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:20,619
...in back of a cruddy boardinghouse
and a tin star.

94
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:25,957
Think I like winding up in a place like this?
It's the end of the line for me, Wyatt.

95
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:30,086
It'll happen to you someday,
just like it happens to all of us.

96
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,934
Where is that yellow-livered skunk?

97
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:46,853
Slow down, Ed.

98
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,521
Holliday's only trying to rile you.

99
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,940
What do you figure's keeping Holliday?

100
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:52,859
Doc's gonna make them dangle a little.

101
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:59,157
Wyatt Earp. Why, you old son of a gun.

102
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,368
Why didn't you let us know
you was riding into town?

103
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:02,952
- Good to see you, John.
- Hi, marshal.

104
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,496
Come on. Sit down.

105
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,416
Cigar?

106
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:12,420
I'll be a son of a gun.

107
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:16,132
You've sure come a long way
since the railroading days in Cheyenne.

108
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,802
Ellsworth, Wichita, now Dodge City.

109
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:22,597
Funny, I never figured you for a lawman.
You was always pretty reckless and wild.

110
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,808
I never figured myself for a lawman either.

111
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:26,434
Fix a nice steak for Mr. Earp.

112
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:28,812
- Yes, sir.
- My personal stock.

113
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:31,773
- How are the brothers?
- Fine. Virgil and Morgan are married.

114
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,775
Virgil and Morgan married?
What do you know?

115
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:36,361
John, I need some help.

116
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,904
Anything I can do for you.

117
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,949
Ike Clanton and Johnny Ringo
rode through here three days ago.

118
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,701
They got a dozen counts against them.

119
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:45,078
I telegraphed Cotton to hold them,
but he crossed me up.

120
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,122
Cotton's skidded a long way.

121
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:50,166
- You know anything?
- Wish I did, but...

122
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:51,543
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

123
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,379
Doc Holliday played poker with them.
Maybe he heard something.

124
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,590
Bartender! Bartender!

125
00:11:57,758 --> 00:12:00,218
Let's have some decent whiskey
around here!

126
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:05,348
Ed Bailey. Doc Holliday killed his brother.

127
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:08,226
The guy was begging for it.
He came in drunk, cheated at cards.

128
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,896
He pulled a gun on Doc.
You ever meet Holliday?

129
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,982
We crossed trails once.
He was a dentist then.

130
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:18,528
You know, I've yet to see the guy pick a fight.
Trouble just naturally seems to find him.

131
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,114
It's gotten so every would-be gunman
on the frontier...

132
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:24,451
...wants the honor
of putting him in Boot Hill.

133
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:27,704
You know how it is
when a man gets a reputation.

134
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,247
I sure do.

135
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,250
Where is Holliday?
I better get to him while the getting's good.

136
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:35,003
- He's at the hotel.
- Keep that steak warm. I'll be back.

137
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:38,131
You ain't missing much. It's longhorn.

138
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,371
Holliday.

139
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,959
Sit down. Make yourself at home
just like you were invited.

140
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,046
- I don't know if you remember...
- Wyatt Earp.

141
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,465
Pulled a tooth for you 10 years ago.

142
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:25,053
If I knew when I had you in the chair
what you were gonna turn out to be, I... Heh.

143
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,181
I hear you've taken up a new occupation.

144
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:32,477
- It's too bad. You were a good dentist.
- My patients didn't like my coughing.

145
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:36,731
I'd like some information.

146
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,984
The name of this game is solitaire.

147
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,656
- I'm in a position to do a little horse trading.
- Good evening, Mr. Earp.

148
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:49,452
- I know something that would interest you.
- You don't know a thing that would interest me.

149
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,751
Suppose I was to tell you that Ed Bailey...

150
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:59,671
...has a small Derringer hidden in his boot.

151
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,215
- Left or right?
- Left.

152
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,718
I'd say that was good information.
Bailey's left-handed.

153
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,888
Ike Clanton and Johnny Ringo
rode through here three days ago.

154
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,849
You played cards.
Which way were they heading?

155
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,351
- Beats me.
- I thought we were making a deal.

156
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,895
That's what you said.
I didn't make any deals.

157
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:20,316
- But you know where they went, don't you?
- Look, you're interrupting my game.

158
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,668
Got a real big hate for the law, haven't you?

159
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,628
Any reason why I shouldn't?

160
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,964
Your brother Morgan
ran me out of Deadwood last year...

161
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,800
...and impounded $10,000 of my money.

162
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:50,930
Hmm. As a matter of fact, you've got brothers
marshaling all over the frontier, haven't you?

163
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,933
I'll see you again, Holliday...

164
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:56,019
...if you're around.

165
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:14,495
- What did you find out?
- Not a thing.

166
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:18,333
It's my hunch they headed for Tombstone.
Ike's old man has a big ranch there.

167
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,542
But I can't be sure.

168
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,045
Isn't your brother Virgil a marshal
at Tombstone?

169
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:25,965
That's right. I sent him a telegram asking him
to be on the lookout for him just in case.

170
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:29,010
- What are you gonna do?
- There's nothing I can do.

171
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,179
The trail's ice-cold.

172
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,806
I'm heading back for Dodge City
in the morning.

173
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,930
- Mr. Holliday.
- Yes?

174
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,557
Would you care to settle up your bill now?

175
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:21,187
Uh, what I mean, sir, is we didn't know
whether you were checking out or not.

176
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:25,525
You'll have word in 15 minutes.

177
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,350
Doc, you're walking into a stacked deck.

178
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:04,689
If Bailey don't get you, the marshal will.
You'd be smart to get out while you can.

179
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,609
You act as if you wanna get killed.

180
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,949
Maybe I do.

181
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,330
Holliday, let's check your gun.

182
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:42,685
Evening, Harry. The usual.

183
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,103
Yes, sir.

184
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:51,360
I understand there's a gentleman in
from Fort Worth to see me.

185
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:56,741
This gentleman should have taught his brother
better than to deal with a marked deck.

186
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:03,539
If you happen to see this, uh, gentleman,
tell him I'll be waiting for him at Boot Hill.

187
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:09,420
He'll have only one direction
to travel from there: down.

188
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,259
Come to think of it...

189
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:16,886
...he's no gentleman at all.

190
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:19,305
He's a son of a yellow-bellied sow.

191
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:35,238
All right, Doc. Let's go.

192
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,865
Ah, right on cue.

193
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:41,119
- What's the charge?
- We'll think of one.

194
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,162
I'm sure you will.

195
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,416
Thanks, Harry.

196
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,716
All right, get him out of here.
It's all over, folks. Break it up.

197
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:58,010
Come on, step up to the bar.
Free drinks on the house.

198
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,887
Give me some beer, bartender.

199
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:04,225
It's always a mess after a killing.

200
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,936
Looks like Doc spoiled everybody's fun.

201
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,938
He's crazy, but he's got nerve,
plenty of nerve.

202
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,607
Shanssey, Mr. Earp,
what are you gonna do about this?

203
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:14,360
You saw what happened.
They had no right to take Doc off.

204
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,362
They're gonna do something to him,
I know it.

205
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,073
- Kate Fisher, friend of Doc's.
- He's gonna be framed. You saw it.

206
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,784
- Bailey pulled a gun on him.
- Wait, Miss Fisher. Take it easy.

207
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,995
Why don't you just relax
and let the law handle this?

208
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,538
Ain't no law in this town.

209
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,957
I never saw a man beg more
to get his brains blown out.

210
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,668
- Please, you gotta help him.
- Doc Holliday's none of my business.

211
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,670
- Please, mister.
- I don't want any part of him.

212
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,338
I don't even like him.

213
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,382
I'm sorry. Good night.

214
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:44,432
Kate, I can have a pair
of saddle horses put round back of the hotel.

215
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,100
That's as much as I can do.

216
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:49,061
With the feeling against Doc,
I wouldn't stay in business 10 minutes...

217
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:51,022
...if they knew I'd helped him.

218
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:54,734
Ten, please.

219
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,965
- Wilson live here?
- Why, no, sir.

220
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:20,968
They're just holding Doc Holliday
upstairs in his room.

221
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:22,595
Oh.

222
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,182
- Mr. Earp...
- Look, Miss Fisher, I told you...

223
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,558
...this is none of my business.

224
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:12,561
I don't care. There's a lynch mob
starting across the street.

225
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,605
That's your business, ain't it?

226
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:19,652
Don't make no difference
whether Doc is right or wrong.

227
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,822
He don't deserve to be hung
by a pack of animals.

228
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,088
You're getting out of here.

229
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:23,924
Since when have you taken
to rescuing gamblers in distress?

230
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:27,219
Don't take it personal, Doc.
I just don't like lynchings.

231
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,726
- What are we waiting for?
- Not yet.

232
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,820
I'd say now is a very good time.

233
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:08,719
Hey! George's barn!

234
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:27,113
That's it. Get going, down the back stairs.

235
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,115
Much obliged, marshal.

236
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,620
I'll see you in Dodge City
and thank you proper.

237
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:37,998
You can thank me properly
by staying out of Dodge City.

238
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:11,050
Whoa!

239
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,065
How about that?

240
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,865
Little out of place for Dodge City,
wouldn't you say?

241
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,534
That's strictly big-city stuff.

242
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:39,578
Looks like she's gonna stay a while.
Got a trunk.

243
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:46,961
I gotta go on a posse.

244
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:50,130
That's what I came to see you about.
Chief Dull Knife is on a rampage again.

245
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:53,842
- I'm gonna have to borrow your deputies.
- You're always short of men.

246
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:56,554
- Who's the girl?
- Yeah, who's the girl?

247
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,264
Girl? What girl?

248
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:03,811
Oh.

249
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:06,397
I was too busy finding out
that Doc Holliday and his lady...

250
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,107
...just checked in at the Dodge House.

251
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:09,817
Doc Holliday?

252
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,694
I told him to keep out of Dodge City.

253
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:13,612
I'd better get over there before he unpacks.

254
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,322
You gonna lend me your deputies?

255
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:19,243
All right, but I'll have to keep Charlie here
with me. You can have the rest of the boys.

256
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:21,495
Don't forget to get back
before those cattle drives.

257
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:24,582
You know how business picks up
when the cowpokes hit town.

258
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:34,717
Mario, go on out and get some fresh air.

259
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:39,430
The mayor's welcoming committee, huh?

260
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,224
I thought I told you
to stay out of Dodge City.

261
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:44,768
I like a sharp razor, don't you?

262
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,854
Care for a shave?

263
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:52,109
There's a stage for Abilene in the morning.

264
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,737
- I want you to be on it.
- Can't.

265
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:57,615
The marshal of Abilene sent me here.

266
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:01,201
Matter of fact, I wish someone
would write you fellas a new speech.

267
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:03,704
I've had the same one in the last five towns.

268
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:06,749
All right, you'll stay in your hotel room
until day after tomorrow.

269
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:09,209
I'll personally escort you
to the westbound train.

270
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:12,296
Wyatt, we've got to face a hard fact.

271
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:16,258
I'm in a state of complete financial collapse.

272
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,802
I don't even have the price of a ticket.

273
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,680
Shanssey told me you had quite a bankroll
back there in Griffin.

274
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:25,392
Shanssey ought to know.
He had 10,000 of mine in his safe.

275
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,061
Know what that son of a gun did?

276
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:29,563
You recall I had to leave town rather hastily.

277
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:33,192
Those two horses in back of the hotel
cost me 5000 apiece.

278
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,819
Now, how about that? Towel, please.

279
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:39,782
Oh, thank you. Heh.

280
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:44,495
Everyone puts such an outlandish value
on my life.

281
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:47,873
Say, Wyatt...

282
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:52,252
...how much do you earn,
about 100 a month and $2 an arrest?

283
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:56,715
- You trying to bribe me?
- Oh, no. Not you.

284
00:27:56,883 --> 00:28:00,552
I feel compelled to offer you
an honest business proposition.

285
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:03,597
That's not bad.

286
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,724
- You got any money saved?
- Some.

287
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:08,560
Wanna buy a small ranch
or a country store someday, huh?

288
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:10,354
Well, I'll make it easy for you.

289
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:14,108
You stake me to $1000
and I'll split my winnings.

290
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:16,819
The cowboys are coming
and the stakes will be big.

291
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:18,153
Fifty-fifty, huh?

292
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:22,491
Actually, any number of people
would be glad to back me for 10 percent...

293
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,535
...but I like you, Wyatt Earp.

294
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,829
I like your cut.

295
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,747
Why so generous with the split?

296
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:30,791
Look, a barber needs this.

297
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,876
You're a lawman, you need a gun.
I'm a gambler.

298
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,337
Money's just a tool of my trade.

299
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:37,589
Of course you'll guarantee you won't lose?

300
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,175
I never lose.

301
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:42,928
You see, poker's played by desperate men
who cherish money.

302
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:45,889
I don't lose, because I have nothing to lose,
including my life.

303
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:47,099
Is it a deal?

304
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,311
Of all the low-down gall.

305
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:55,858
You're just gonna have to stake me
to a railroad ticket.

306
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:06,118
Holliday, I've done some foolish things
in my life.

307
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,912
I'm about to do another.

308
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,081
I'm gonna let you stay in town.

309
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,169
Why so generous?

310
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:17,629
Let's say I like your cut.

311
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:20,215
You can stay and you can play
on one condition:

312
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:22,468
No knives, no guns and no killings.

313
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:28,098
No knives, no guns, no killings.

314
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:29,892
That's it.

315
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:32,728
You have my word as a gentleman.

316
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:34,688
Just one more thing.

317
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,982
You ought to treat that woman decent
or leave her.

318
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,692
Kate?

319
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,235
Yes, poor old Kate.

320
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:43,238
She stands for everything I hate
in Doc Holliday.

321
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:46,116
Oh, leave two bits for the barber, will you?

322
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,793
I found out all about your lady fair.

323
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,294
Hey, where'd you get the new gun?

324
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,421
Buntline made it for me special.
What lady fair?

325
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:01,507
Sure beautiful. Isn't that barrel too long?

326
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:03,509
No. Good balance, just right.
What's beautiful?

327
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:05,844
- Hand-tooled too, huh?
- What are you talking about?

328
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:09,515
- That girl that came in on the stage.
- Oh, yeah, I remember. What about her?

329
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:11,767
She's staying over at Mrs. Deeds' place.

330
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:15,062
They tell me she's got a trunkful
of the most elegant clothes you've ever seen.

331
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,689
Some of them dresses clean
from Paris, France.

332
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:22,110
She's 5'6", weighs 120 pounds,
red hair, green eyes...

333
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:23,529
What is she doing here?

334
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:25,113
Gambler.

335
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:28,283
Very funny.

336
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,703
Well, if you think that's funny...

337
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:34,206
...why don't you take a walk over
to the Long Branch saloon?

338
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,500
You'll die laughing.

339
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:51,974
Hello, Wyatt.

340
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:55,686
What's the trouble?

341
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,688
Kelly, I'm gonna have to
break up that game.

342
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:00,190
Can't do that, Wyatt.
There's no law against women gambling.

343
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:04,361
I know, but every time there's a woman
at the tables, there's trouble. You know that.

344
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:10,075
- Sorry, game's over.
- Wyatt, this is Laura Denbow.

345
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:11,702
Kelly, you're the mayor of this town.

346
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,288
We agreed there'd be no women
gambling on the north side.

347
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:18,083
Miss Denbow's marker is respected
for $10,000 anywhere in the West.

348
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:21,503
- We all consider her an exception.
- Not in Dodge City she isn't.

349
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:26,300
So you're the famous Wyatt Earp.
Lawman, judge and jury.

350
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:28,176
That's right, Miss Gambler.

351
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:31,305
Start with you and we'll have every tramp
on the south side over here.

352
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:32,681
Who's a tramp?

353
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:35,976
- Shut up and keep out of this, cowboy.
- You're talking to a lady.

354
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:38,145
It appears the marshal
hasn't met a lady before.

355
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,147
You're in a saloon playing a man's game.

356
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:44,526
- Why should you be treated like a lady?
- And you ain't no gentleman.

357
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:47,905
- That's all for tonight, Miss Denbow.
- Take your hands off her.

358
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:56,330
Hold it, Charlie.

359
00:31:57,248 --> 00:32:00,375
I'm tired of you pushing people around.

360
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:02,628
Now, go for your gun. I'm gonna kill you.

361
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:05,047
I don't have a gun, cowboy.

362
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:06,965
I'm unarmed.

363
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,058
Stay where you are.

364
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:18,977
You're drunk.
You don't know what you're doing.

365
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:22,522
Now, give me that gun
before you get into real trouble.

366
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:30,447
I don't stand for nobody
talking like that to no lady.

367
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,743
You stand real still.

368
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,497
And just give me that gun.

369
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:03,271
I ain't no gunman.

370
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:07,401
I couldn't kill anybody.

371
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:09,569
I know that, cowboy.

372
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:12,906
You were just trying to impress the lady.

373
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:17,452
Charlie, take him down and sober him up
and get him out of town.

374
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,540
You're under arrest.

375
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:24,501
- For what, Mr. Earp?
- You just saw it. Disturbing the peace.

376
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:27,421
- Wait a minute, Wyatt.
- It's all right, Mayor Kelly.

377
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:31,550
The marshal's only trying to save
the good name of Dodge City.

378
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:35,053
Besides, I might like to see
the inside of a jail.

379
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:38,390
Don't you think you better wait
for a few of your deputies?

380
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:39,683
I might be desperate.

381
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:03,832
I'll let you go if you promise
to do your gambling south of the deadline.

382
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,001
South of the deadline?

383
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,046
No, I think I'll stay.

384
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:12,299
Perhaps the judge isn't as righteous
as the marshal.

385
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,178
Well, aren't you going to open the door?

386
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:28,732
Oh, I, uh, won't be needing these
while I'm here.

387
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:33,445
Why don't you buy yourself a new halo?
The one you're wearing's too tight.

388
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:38,909
Close the door, marshal.

389
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:57,094
- Locked her up?
- That's right. Disturbing the peace.

390
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:03,016
- I could get her out.
- Five hundred says you can't.

391
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:06,186
Make it the thousand I owe you.

392
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:10,357
Double or nothing.

393
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:12,234
It's a bet.

394
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,406
I'll be back in 30 minutes.

395
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:35,048
- Good evening, Charlie.
- Oh, hi, Doc.

396
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:40,220
Man, this 12 on and 12 off
is sure ruining my homework.

397
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,813
I spend half my life
on that darned paperwork.

398
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,439
Care for a nip?

399
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:54,234
Doc, you know Wyatt
don't like drinking on duty.

400
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:58,655
What's the occasion?

401
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,365
I'd like to bail out Miss Denbow.

402
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:03,034
Hit me.

403
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:07,122
- I got 19.
- Twenty.

404
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,000
Can't do it, Doc.

405
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:13,879
She's gotta appear in court tomorrow.
No bail's been set yet.

406
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:19,342
I think I'll stand on these.

407
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:22,929
Twenty-one.

408
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:27,267
Oh, I'll wait for Wyatt.

409
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:32,981
I sure hope Bat gets back with our deputies
before them cowboys hit town.

410
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:36,109
- Blackjack.
- I got one too.

411
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:49,956
You know, Doc, if we was playing for real,
I'd be compelled to have a look at that deck.

412
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,959
I'd be compelled to ask you to try it.

413
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,003
Use mine, huh?

414
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,591
Good thing Wyatt don't let us
go around drawing these.

415
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,551
Somebody might get hurt.

416
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:07,349
Well, I gotta go have a look
at the prisoners and horses.

417
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:11,144
- Watch the office for me, will you, Doc?
- Sure thing, Charlie.

418
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:31,289
- Never could get the hang of these things.
- What are you doing here?

419
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:33,708
Wyatt, I'd like to bail out Miss Denbow.

420
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:35,877
She happens to be a lady.

421
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,421
No favors, Holliday.

422
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:42,425
Well, let's say you release her
in exchange for some information.

423
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:47,097
You don't know a thing
that would interest me.

424
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:52,602
Suppose I were to tell you that Shanghai Pierce
is bringing his herd here.

425
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,396
Shanghai Pierce, huh?

426
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:56,648
I take it you've had some run-ins with him.

427
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:59,693
I had to bat him over the head
once or twice...

428
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,987
...when he got drunk
and tried to shoot up Wichita.

429
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:05,615
- Not a bad guy. Just forgot to grow up.
- He's aiming to shoot up Dodge City.

430
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:08,743
He's hired Ringo to make sure
you don't spoil his fun.

431
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:11,246
Oh, and what's more, he, uh...

432
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:15,875
He's put a price of $1000 on your head, dead.

433
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:17,502
What else is new?

434
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:21,339
Well, I... Heh. I thought it was kind of amusing,
a price on a lawman's head.

435
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:25,427
Look, Holliday, as long as I'm the law here...

436
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:28,930
...not one of those cowpokes
is gonna cross that deadline with a gun.

437
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:31,349
I don't care if his name is Shanghai Pierce.

438
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:35,437
Well spoken.
I'll repeat those words at your funeral.

439
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:41,359
- How about releasing Miss Denbow?
- Nothing doing.

440
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,404
Look, you made a deal.

441
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:48,450
You made the deal.
I didn't agree to a thing, remember?

442
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:53,997
- Charlie, you're working for a crook.
- Oh, yeah?

443
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,374
Go home, Charlie, and turn in.
I'll finish these reports.

444
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:57,625
Thanks. Everything's quiet.

445
00:38:57,793 --> 00:39:00,170
- Good night.
- Good night.

446
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:06,509
Wyatt, you ought to turn her loose.
She's got no business behind bars.

447
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,347
I think Charlie's right.

448
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:17,854
Let her out.

449
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:22,275
- Conscience?
- Maybe I like her.

450
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:25,570
Tell Kelly she's to play in the side room.

451
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:28,281
I don't want her gambling on the main floor.

452
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:31,868
- Good evening, Miss Denbow.
- Good evening, Doc.

453
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:35,163
Come on, Laura,
we've got business to take care of.

454
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:36,915
Thank you.

455
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:43,963
Marshal.

456
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:55,683
- Good evening, Mr. Earp.
- Good evening, Miss Denbow.

457
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:58,686
Good evening, Mr. Earp.

458
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:07,362
Pair of deuces.

459
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,656
I'll check to the lady.

460
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,116
- Fifty.
- I'll stay.

461
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:12,325
Too steep for me.

462
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,829
- I'm in.
- Fifty, huh? I'll make it 50 more.

463
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:17,872
I'm in for the 50.

464
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:20,208
- Doc, it's almost morning.
- Queen of clubs.

465
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:22,877
Jack of spades, three tens.

466
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:24,462
- You didn't answer me.
- Three deuces.

467
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,256
- I'll make it 100.
- Doc.

468
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,633
Go buy yourself a drink.

469
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:31,428
- And I'll raise you 100.
- Too much for me.

470
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:33,680
Two hundred to me. I'll call you.

471
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:36,057
I'll go along with the lady.

472
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:37,851
Four deuces.

473
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:39,352
Gentlemen, we've been outclassed.

474
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,855
Ha, ha. Thank you, gentlemen.
I think I'll call it a night.

475
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:43,314
Will you cash me in, Frank?

476
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:46,025
- Good night. Good night, Mayor Kelly.
- May I see you home?

477
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:49,571
- No, thank you, Doc. Good night.
- Good night.

478
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:54,075
- Well, how about a little draw, boys?
- I'll get my ante in there.

479
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:57,162
- Good night.
- She's a real lady.

480
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:58,371
And lucky.

481
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:02,041
That's true.

482
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:16,014
Kelly, I need Luke Short.

483
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:18,516
Ritchie Bell and two of his boys
held up the bank at Salina.

484
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:20,643
They killed the cashier.
They're heading this way.

485
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:23,688
I sent Luke to Abilene, Wyatt. I'm sorry.

486
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:28,193
- How soon do you have to pull out?
- Right away if I expect to pick up their trail.

487
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:31,821
Doggone it, Luke's the only one in town
who can handle a gun.

488
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,615
What about Charlie Bassett?

489
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:35,366
Somebody's gotta mind the town.

490
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:37,243
You want a gunhand?

491
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:40,622
You? No, thanks.

492
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:42,832
I do handle one pretty well.

493
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,418
The only trouble is,
those best able to testify to my aim...

494
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:47,754
...aren't around for comment.

495
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,714
I'll take care of it alone.

496
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:51,674
Suit yourself.

497
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,853
Hold up your right hand.

498
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:06,481
Do you solemnly swear to uphold...?

499
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:08,733
Oh, this is ridiculous. You're deputized.

500
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:12,237
- Grab some gear. I'll get the horses.
- Wait a minute. Don't I get to wear a tin star?

501
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:14,280
Not on your life.

502
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:08,626
Medicine.

503
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,760
For a smart gambler,
you sure play sucker odds.

504
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:19,971
You're gonna be dead inside of a year.

505
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:24,142
What do you know about odds, preacher?
This kind of cough doesn't go away.

506
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,477
Why don't you get out of those
stinking saloons?

507
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:29,480
- Pack up and go live in the mountains.
- Not me.

508
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:31,774
You're just ornery enough
to live to a ripe old age.

509
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:35,361
No, I'm not gonna let it drain me out slow.

510
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:39,699
Sure. Play it hard and fast.

511
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:43,369
Listen, Wyatt, the only thing
I'm really scared of is dying in bed.

512
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,705
I don't wanna go little by little.

513
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:50,376
Someday somebody's got to outshoot me,
and it'll be over with real quick.

514
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:54,255
Earp, I didn't come along
to hear you preach a sermon.

515
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,301
You know, I've been wondering about that.

516
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,348
Why did you come?

517
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:07,393
If I stick around long enough, sooner or later
you've got to put your head in a noose.

518
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:09,437
I'm gonna bail you out.

519
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:13,316
I've only got one debt in this world,
and I don't like owing it to you.

520
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:16,569
You don't owe me a thing.
I've never needed anybody in my life...

521
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:18,404
...and I sure don't need Doc Holliday.

522
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:20,281
You're pretty positive about that.

523
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:24,702
As far as I'm concerned,
you can get on your horse and keep riding.

524
00:44:26,246 --> 00:44:29,415
No, thanks. I think I'll stay.

525
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:36,381
You know, Wyatt, you and I
are pretty much alike, actually.

526
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:38,257
Both of us live with a gun.

527
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:40,301
The only difference is that badge.

528
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:43,888
What's the matter, preacher?
Don't you like being preached at?

529
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:45,765
Shut up and go to sleep.

530
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:04,135
Ritchie Bell won't be robbing
any more banks.

531
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:06,387
I thought you were asleep.

532
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:08,222
No, it figured.

533
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:11,392
Let's head back to Dodge.
I wanna get in a bed.

534
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:14,228
What for? They're not going anyplace.
Neither are we.

535
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:16,314
I'm getting some sleep.

536
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:22,862
Get out of those stinking saloons.

537
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:25,656
Pack up, live in the mountains.

538
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:40,338
- Charlie.
- Hi.

539
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:44,300
I'll go in to fix up the coroner's report.
Thanks a lot, Doc.

540
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:46,302
You and I are even.

541
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,221
Not yet.

542
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:51,057
Not until the debt's paid in full, marshal.

543
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:58,940
I hear you did some
pretty fancy shooting, Doc.

544
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:02,235
Well, it's all in a day's work for a deputy.

545
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:06,322
You all right?

546
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:12,787
Find Kate and tell her to come to the hotel
right away, will you?

547
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:14,997
Kate hasn't been around for a while, Doc.

548
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:16,457
What do you mean?

549
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:21,212
I mean nobody's seen her
on this side of town since you rode out.

550
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:25,716
Should I get a doctor?

551
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:02,628
Morning, Laura.

552
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:05,006
Oh, I never thought I'd be glad to see you.

553
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:07,383
- Something wrong?
- My horse has gone lame.

554
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:09,218
Right forefoot.

555
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:21,188
Hoof split. Better not ride him in.

556
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:23,774
Leave him here. He won't go far.

557
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:27,361
- I'll send the blacksmith out.
- Nice you happened along.

558
00:48:29,364 --> 00:48:31,157
I didn't happen along.

559
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:34,452
I know you ride out this way every day.

560
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:39,707
Come on. I'll give you a ride into town.

561
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,715
Unless you'd rather walk six miles.

562
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:01,771
Better hold on tight.

563
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:06,567
Tighter.

564
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:42,186
Doc, what are you doing up
this time of day? It's only 3:00.

565
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:47,024
I'm on a health bender.
Up before noon, take a 20-yard walk.

566
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:53,280
What's the action here?

567
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:57,910
I'm picking up the hardware
as soon as the cowboys hit town.

568
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:02,790
Sure don't look like Bat's gonna get back
with our deputies soon enough.

569
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,959
Where's Kate?

570
00:50:08,213 --> 00:50:10,339
Where is she, Charlie?

571
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:14,635
It's kind of touchy, Doc.

572
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:16,429
I...

573
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:18,180
Yes?

574
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:24,854
You promised Wyatt
there wouldn't be any gunplay, Doc.

575
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:28,065
- Now, you can't...
- Where is she, Charlie?

576
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:34,113
Wiley's hotel. Ringo blew into town,
and Kate's taking up with him.

577
00:50:41,496 --> 00:50:44,081
Sure is a lot of beef coming in here.

578
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:48,961
This is just the beginning. Wait till the...

579
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:52,548
Look, Doc, a gunfight right now
could cause Wyatt a lot of trouble.

580
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:54,341
A lot of trouble.

581
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:57,511
Sure is a mess of cattle here.

582
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:37,384
Get out and stay out, you no-good tramp!

583
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:39,470
And don't come back.

584
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:02,618
Write you my mind

585
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:06,997
My mind is to marry, love

586
00:52:07,165 --> 00:52:09,875
And leave you behind

587
00:52:18,051 --> 00:52:19,927
So you got homesick.

588
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:25,641
Well, well, if it ain't the little deputy.

589
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:28,144
You've been gone for three days.

590
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:30,187
I didn't think you'd notice.

591
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:33,107
You've been gallivanting all over the country
with Mr. Virtue.

592
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:36,235
I was sick, Kate. I needed you.

593
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:43,617
Why don't you put a rope around my neck
and pull on it when you want me?

594
00:52:43,785 --> 00:52:46,579
Can't stay away.
Just can't stay away, can you?

595
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:48,622
Oh, leave me alone, Doc.

596
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:52,001
Always gotta crawl back to your gutter.

597
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:55,337
Maybe I wouldn't
if you ever noticed I was alive.

598
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:58,340
What difference does it make to you
where I go or who I take up with?

599
00:52:58,508 --> 00:52:59,842
Shut up!

600
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:03,971
Get your things together. You're leaving.

601
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:09,393
She's staying here.

602
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:11,645
Keep out of this, Ringo.

603
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:16,025
- You got no right to come busting in here.
- I'm talking to Kate. Take a walk.

604
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:20,529
Anything you gotta say,
you can say it in front of him.

605
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:27,203
- You slut.
- Wait a minute, Holliday.

606
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:30,706
You don't talk to my woman like that.

607
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:34,460
Your woman. Anybody's woman.

608
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:36,879
I'm gonna blast you apart.

609
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:40,007
I don't have a gun, Ringo.

610
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:47,139
You got one now.

611
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:56,815
Reach.

612
00:54:04,699 --> 00:54:07,493
- I'm not fighting.
- He won't fight.

613
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:10,454
He promised Wyatt Earp
he'd be a good little boy, ha, ha.

614
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:14,500
I heard you made your reputation
against a bunch of drunks.

615
00:54:16,002 --> 00:54:17,461
Go on, reach.

616
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:24,969
I'm not fighting.

617
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:27,429
Well, have a drink, then.

618
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:42,778
Oh, Doc.

619
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:11,640
It was a lovely dance.
I'm sorry I have to leave so soon.

620
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:13,934
- You're breaking a lot of hearts.
- Ha, ha.

621
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:17,021
- Good night, Mayor Kelly.
- Good night, Miss Denbow.

622
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:21,400
May I take you somewhere?

623
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:25,404
- No, thank you. It's just a short way.
- It's early and I have to ride out for the bluffs.

624
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:48,218
Oh, it is lovely here. I'm glad I came.

625
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:09,823
You've lost your poker face.

626
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:12,451
You look like a scared little girl.

627
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:14,995
I'm not scared.

628
00:56:15,663 --> 00:56:18,290
And I am certainly not a little girl.

629
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:42,981
Why did you come out here with me?

630
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:48,237
I wish I could answer that.

631
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:50,114
I don't know.

632
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:53,450
I'll tell you why you came.

633
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:30,779
- Frisky bunch, eh, Ringo?
- Yeah.

634
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:40,581
This ought to learn them once and for all
who owns the cow towns. Ha, ha.

635
00:57:40,748 --> 00:57:42,124
Yeah.

636
00:57:46,254 --> 00:57:48,964
Shanghai Pierce has hit town.
His men are hurrahing Front Street.

637
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:51,800
See if you can find Wyatt quick as you can.
Get some help.

638
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:53,927
I'll try to hold them off.

639
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:56,805
I don't want anybody
out there on the streets!

640
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:07,107
Pierce, call off your men
before somebody gets hurt.

641
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:11,987
Tell your boss I'm waiting
for his personal invitation.

642
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:13,614
You're under arrest, Pierce.

643
00:58:13,781 --> 00:58:17,451
You hear that, Ringo? I'm under arrest.

644
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:18,702
I heard.

645
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:34,843
Sure are noisy.

646
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:39,056
Sure are.

647
00:58:42,268 --> 00:58:44,520
Let's quit. I wanna get out of here.

648
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:47,648
Just keep dealing. I'm not breaking this run.

649
00:58:47,815 --> 00:58:49,233
Hit me.

650
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:56,949
- Doc, please!
- Deal.

651
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:02,204
Well, what have we here?

652
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:05,582
A dance. Now, ain't that nice?

653
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:09,461
You folks gonna invite us in?

654
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:11,630
Ain't very hospitable, are they, boss?

655
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:14,424
You better get that scum of yours
south of the deadline.

656
00:59:14,592 --> 00:59:16,176
You hear that, boys?

657
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:19,263
These are respectable folks.

658
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:21,515
They're good enough to take our money.

659
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:24,560
I say my men are good enough
to dance with your women.

660
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:50,961
My boys wanna dance!

661
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:53,839
Piano player, make some music!

662
00:59:56,884 --> 00:59:58,051
Make it lively!

663
01:00:19,407 --> 01:00:26,371
- Hello, Shanghai.
- Well, now my day is complete.

664
01:00:26,539 --> 01:00:30,834
You and me are gonna settle
for this scar you gave me in Wichita.

665
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:35,672
Unbuckle your guns, boys, and come down
to the calaboose with me.

666
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:39,051
You better start praying, Earp.
You've pulled your last bluff.

667
01:00:39,218 --> 01:00:41,762
Think straight, Shanghai,
before you get into too much trouble...

668
01:00:41,929 --> 01:00:44,264
- ...and can't get out of it.
- Let's work him over, boss.

669
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:46,308
That's a real good idea.

670
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:50,562
Maybe your friends would like to see
how tough you really are.

671
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:53,106
I'd like to see you do a dance, marshal.

672
01:00:53,274 --> 01:00:55,984
That's mighty brave talk, Shanghai,
with 20 men behind you.

673
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:58,862
Let's you and me step out
into the street alone.

674
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:01,948
Oh, no. You don't sucker me into that.

675
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:05,118
Can't bluff your way out, huh?

676
01:01:05,703 --> 01:01:08,705
All right, boys. Take the skunk.

677
01:01:13,586 --> 01:01:17,172
You gentlemen made such a racket,
Frank Loving was too scared to deal.

678
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:18,882
You busted my winning streak.

679
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:22,886
Fun's over, boys. Unbuckle them.

680
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:24,596
Let's shoot it out.

681
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:25,931
All right, Shanghai?

682
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:28,266
Go ahead. Draw, all of you.

683
01:01:28,434 --> 01:01:29,893
But you get it first, Shanghai.

684
01:01:30,061 --> 01:01:31,645
And you second, Ringo.

685
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:33,522
Well, call the play.

686
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:37,234
I'll give you five seconds
to unbuckle your guns.

687
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:39,236
One...

688
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:43,198
...two...

689
01:01:44,075 --> 01:01:45,742
...three...

690
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:47,077
...four...

691
01:01:47,286 --> 01:01:50,205
We had enough fun, boys. Unbuckle them.

692
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:51,707
Harry, Justin, get the hardware.

693
01:01:53,084 --> 01:01:54,501
Get moving.

694
01:01:55,002 --> 01:01:56,628
Doc!

695
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:01,675
Anybody else wanna try their luck?

696
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:06,221
Get moving. Come on!
Keep moving, all of you!

697
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:09,307
All right, Doc. We ain't finished yet.

698
01:02:09,475 --> 01:02:12,894
You would have been,
but I feel in a charitable mood tonight.

699
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:28,493
Keep moving. Come on.

700
01:02:33,249 --> 01:02:35,292
Kelly, take them down
and lock them up for the night.

701
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:36,585
You heard the marshal.

702
01:02:37,962 --> 01:02:39,713
Come on. Let's get moving.

703
01:02:41,632 --> 01:02:44,092
I don't suppose you want my thanks.

704
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:47,387
Let's just say my account is paid in full.

705
01:02:47,555 --> 01:02:49,681
And don't take it personal, marshal.

706
01:03:11,412 --> 01:03:12,954
Morning, Doc.

707
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:14,998
Morning.

708
01:03:19,253 --> 01:03:22,881
Just thought you'd like to know there's
gonna be one less lawman in the territory.

709
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:25,675
That's always good news to me.

710
01:03:25,927 --> 01:03:28,261
I'm heading for California, buying a ranch.

711
01:03:28,429 --> 01:03:31,097
I'm taking your good advice,
getting out while there's time.

712
01:03:31,265 --> 01:03:32,307
Smart man.

713
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:35,811
Laura's coming with me.

714
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:37,479
We're getting married in a few days.

715
01:03:38,439 --> 01:03:42,526
We'd like you to come to the wedding, Doc,
if it doesn't interfere with your poker.

716
01:03:42,985 --> 01:03:46,613
I'm not good at weddings, only funerals.
Deal me out.

717
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:53,328
Wyatt.

718
01:03:54,288 --> 01:03:56,039
She's a real lady.

719
01:03:56,207 --> 01:03:58,625
I wish you both a lot of happiness.

720
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:02,128
You're lucky to be getting out
of this country.

721
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,923
Why don't you try your luck?

722
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:07,425
Hmm.

723
01:04:09,762 --> 01:04:11,763
So long, Doc.

724
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:30,490
Take me back, Doc.

725
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:33,577
Please?

726
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:37,539
Give me another chance.

727
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:46,756
Please take me back.

728
01:04:48,759 --> 01:04:50,886
I'll do anything you say.

729
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:53,930
I don't care how you treat me.

730
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:58,393
Doc, I'm sorry for what I done.

731
01:04:58,561 --> 01:05:00,896
It's not your fault, Kate.

732
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:03,607
It's not my fault. It's not anybody's fault.

733
01:05:04,525 --> 01:05:06,943
It's just the way the cards fall.

734
01:05:10,573 --> 01:05:13,533
I never gave you much of a chance, did I?

735
01:05:15,661 --> 01:05:19,247
Maybe it could have been different
if I was right to you, but...

736
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:21,917
It ain't too late, Doc. I'll be good to you.

737
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:24,085
I... I promise.

738
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:25,795
It's too late for both of us.

739
01:05:26,505 --> 01:05:30,383
Do something better for yourself
while you've still got the chance.

740
01:05:45,191 --> 01:05:47,734
Don't let me go, Doc.
Don't let me go back there.

741
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:51,237
Leave me alone. Just leave me alone.

742
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:04,626
I'll see you dead.

743
01:06:23,437 --> 01:06:25,105
- Hi, Wyatt.
- Charlie.

744
01:06:25,272 --> 01:06:29,234
- You got a letter from the attorney general.
- What's he got to say?

745
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:38,576
He says he can get you an appointment
as U.S. marshal any time you want it.

746
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:43,456
Wyatt Earp, United States marshal.
That's all I need.

747
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:45,792
These are all dead, Charlie.

748
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:48,003
Oh, before I forget...

749
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:51,089
...this is yours now.

750
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:53,216
I'm through as a lawman for good.

751
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:58,013
- Oh, you got a telegram too.
- Read it.

752
01:07:24,832 --> 01:07:26,499
Virgil's my brother.

753
01:07:26,667 --> 01:07:30,253
He's in trouble. He needs me.
Try to understand, Laura.

754
01:07:30,421 --> 01:07:32,756
I understand I was foolish to fall in love.

755
01:07:32,965 --> 01:07:35,383
- If only I could...
- Wyatt, when I first met you...

756
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:37,927
...I told you I wouldn't follow you
from town to town...

757
01:07:38,095 --> 01:07:41,431
...sitting in the darkness, waiting for someone
to bring the news you'd been killed.

758
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:43,433
I won't live that way.

759
01:07:43,601 --> 01:07:46,061
We're not gonna start a life together
with a gun in your hand.

760
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:48,563
I swear to you, Laura.
I'm through after Tombstone.

761
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:49,939
You'll never be through.

762
01:07:50,107 --> 01:07:52,025
Your reputation will follow you
wherever you are.

763
01:07:52,193 --> 01:07:54,402
- Laura, he's my brother.
- And I'm to be your wife.

764
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:57,906
- Don't ask me to let him down.
- Don't let me down.

765
01:07:58,115 --> 01:08:00,992
I'd give up anything.
I'll go anywhere for you.

766
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:02,994
I'll work beside you in the fields.

767
01:08:03,537 --> 01:08:06,206
But you've got to meet me halfway.

768
01:08:24,975 --> 01:08:26,726
I must go to Tombstone.

769
01:08:28,562 --> 01:08:31,564
All right, go. Clean up Tombstone.

770
01:08:31,732 --> 01:08:33,775
There's a hundred more Tombstones
on the frontier...

771
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:37,070
...all waiting for the great Wyatt Earp.

772
01:08:37,571 --> 01:08:39,989
Go on. Clean them all up.

773
01:08:40,574 --> 01:08:42,033
Go on!

774
01:08:43,911 --> 01:08:45,620
I love you, Laura.

775
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:16,067
I love you, Wyatt.

776
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:14,667
Good afternoon, marshal.
Out for a little ride?

777
01:10:14,835 --> 01:10:16,794
About 700 miles' worth. Tombstone.

778
01:10:16,962 --> 01:10:19,005
Tombstone, huh?
I'm heading that way myself.

779
01:10:19,173 --> 01:10:21,966
I understand the climate down there
may be better for my cough.

780
01:10:22,134 --> 01:10:24,385
Since when have you gotten interested
in your health?

781
01:10:24,553 --> 01:10:27,263
Well, it's really a matter of finances.
The deck's gone cold here.

782
01:10:27,431 --> 01:10:29,807
Nobody will give me any play.

783
01:10:30,017 --> 01:10:31,893
Mind if I ride along?

784
01:10:32,102 --> 01:10:34,187
It's a free country. Hop on.

785
01:10:34,688 --> 01:10:36,439
Where's your gear?

786
01:11:49,596 --> 01:11:51,931
Whoa, whoa. Whoa.

787
01:11:56,395 --> 01:11:59,772
Well, thanks for the ride.
Sell my horse and get a good price.

788
01:12:03,277 --> 01:12:04,319
Doc.

789
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:07,488
I know. No knives, no guns, no killing.

790
01:12:17,666 --> 01:12:19,042
Man, that's good.

791
01:12:19,209 --> 01:12:21,836
I just about forgot
what a home-cooked meal tastes like.

792
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:24,172
Betty, I'm gonna steal you away from Virgil.

793
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:27,258
By golly, Wyatt, you're gonna be
the only single one left.

794
01:12:27,426 --> 01:12:29,260
I got a family going in Deadwood.

795
01:12:29,428 --> 01:12:32,305
Even little Jimmy here's tying the knot
when he gets back to California.

796
01:12:32,473 --> 01:12:35,183
What do you mean, "little Jimmy"?
I'll be 19 next month.

797
01:12:36,602 --> 01:12:38,603
Nineteen.

798
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:43,358
Say, when are you gonna
get hitched, Wyatt?

799
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:47,445
Cigar?

800
01:12:49,156 --> 01:12:52,241
There's the signal for women and children
to leave the room.

801
01:12:52,409 --> 01:12:54,535
Come on, Tommy. It's your bedtime now.

802
01:12:54,703 --> 01:12:56,371
Aw, Mom, do I have to?

803
01:12:56,538 --> 01:12:58,873
Yes, you do.
Your uncles will all be here tomorrow.

804
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:01,459
- Good night, Uncle Wyatt.
- Good night, Tommy.

805
01:13:01,627 --> 01:13:03,795
- Good night, Uncle Morgan.
- Good night, son.

806
01:13:03,962 --> 01:13:06,089
- Good night, Uncle James.
- Good night, Tommy.

807
01:13:06,256 --> 01:13:08,299
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, son.

808
01:13:11,512 --> 01:13:13,763
It's nice to have you here.

809
01:13:14,014 --> 01:13:17,683
I only wish it were
under happier circumstances.

810
01:13:27,444 --> 01:13:28,694
She seems pretty upset.

811
01:13:28,862 --> 01:13:32,073
Well, she's been after me for a year
to quit marshaling.

812
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:34,283
You know how women are.

813
01:13:35,661 --> 01:13:38,329
All right. Now, let's get down to business.

814
01:13:38,497 --> 01:13:41,040
Now, Morgan and Jimmy
know the setup here.

815
01:13:41,208 --> 01:13:44,377
Now, Wyatt, you know Ike Clanton has a ranch
outside city limits.

816
01:13:44,545 --> 01:13:45,628
Yes, I know.

817
01:13:45,796 --> 01:13:49,715
He's organized the toughest bunch
of gunslingers you ever laid eyes on.

818
01:13:49,883 --> 01:13:51,092
He owns the county sheriff.

819
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:53,594
- Who is he?
- Cotton Wilson.

820
01:13:53,762 --> 01:13:56,264
Cotton Wilson. So Ike paid off on his deal.

821
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:59,684
Clanton's been rustling Mexican cattle
by the thousands.

822
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:01,477
And he has to move them.

823
01:14:01,645 --> 01:14:06,190
He can only ship them out of Tombstone,
and he can't do that while we control the city.

824
01:14:06,358 --> 01:14:07,483
That's about it.

825
01:14:07,651 --> 01:14:09,652
He's organized, and he's mean.

826
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:13,489
- We can't keep him out of Tombstone forever.
- What about the people of Tombstone?

827
01:14:13,657 --> 01:14:15,408
John Clum, editor of the Epitaph...

828
01:14:15,576 --> 01:14:19,871
...and some of the leading citizens will back us
if they know you're calling the shots.

829
01:14:20,038 --> 01:14:23,499
We're all agreed, Wyatt.
You should run the show.

830
01:14:29,381 --> 01:14:31,799
There's only one thing that bothers me...

831
01:14:31,967 --> 01:14:34,427
...and I wanna speak my piece now.

832
01:14:35,053 --> 01:14:39,432
There's gonna be a lot of bad talk
about you riding with Doc Holliday.

833
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:41,684
What about Holliday?

834
01:14:41,977 --> 01:14:45,146
He's the worst killer on the frontier,
that's what about him.

835
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:48,399
It just don't look good,
you coming here with him.

836
01:14:49,943 --> 01:14:52,862
Holliday saved my life in Dodge City.
I don't forget that.

837
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:55,198
What's more, he's a man of his word.

838
01:14:55,365 --> 01:14:57,992
As long as he plays his cards straight
and keeps out of killings...

839
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:00,411
...we got no right to run him out of town.

840
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:04,749
- I didn't know you two were a team.
- We're not. It's just a case of square deal.

841
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:06,709
Holliday stays.

842
01:15:08,253 --> 01:15:10,713
All right, Wyatt. He's your responsibility.

843
01:15:10,881 --> 01:15:13,132
That suits me fine.
Do we have a map of the county?

844
01:15:14,426 --> 01:15:18,846
The first thing we gotta do is let the Clantons
know that the city is closed to them.

845
01:15:19,014 --> 01:15:22,266
Then we gotta control the county.
Now, that's important.

846
01:15:22,434 --> 01:15:25,686
I'm gonna get a letter off to a man tonight
who'll take care of that matter for us.

847
01:15:25,854 --> 01:15:27,772
- Now show me where the Clanton ranch is.
- Here.

848
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:29,148
Where does he keep his men?

849
01:15:39,284 --> 01:15:41,744
Hello, Cotton. I've been expecting you.

850
01:15:41,912 --> 01:15:44,497
You're looking fine, real prosperous.

851
01:15:44,665 --> 01:15:47,458
- Oh, I ain't complaining.
- What's on your mind?

852
01:15:47,626 --> 01:15:51,671
Wyatt, Ike wants to make you a deal.
He promises no trouble...

853
01:15:51,838 --> 01:15:53,839
...if you let him ship his cattle
out of Tombstone.

854
01:15:54,007 --> 01:15:56,926
- Well, that's mighty nice of Ike.
- Ike's a nice fella.

855
01:15:57,094 --> 01:16:00,596
He's got a fortune
tied up in cattle out there at the ranch...

856
01:16:00,764 --> 01:16:03,683
...and he's gonna move them.
- Oh, he is, huh?

857
01:16:10,774 --> 01:16:13,776
There's $20,000 in it for you, cash.

858
01:16:15,028 --> 01:16:17,613
Twenty thousand dollars?

859
01:16:17,781 --> 01:16:19,323
The wages of sin are rising.

860
01:16:19,533 --> 01:16:22,618
Twenty thousand against a 6-foot hole
in Boot Hill...

861
01:16:22,786 --> 01:16:26,455
...or a $20-a-month pension
if you live long enough to collect it.

862
01:16:32,379 --> 01:16:34,505
I've thought about those things.

863
01:16:40,679 --> 01:16:42,430
You know, Cotton...

864
01:16:42,973 --> 01:16:46,934
...this is a nice little town,
a good place to set a while.

865
01:16:47,436 --> 01:16:49,687
I might even run for county sheriff
in a couple of months.

866
01:16:49,855 --> 01:16:52,481
That don't scare me at all. I got mine.

867
01:16:52,649 --> 01:16:55,735
I got a ranch now and 25,000 in the bank,
and you know something?

868
01:16:55,902 --> 01:16:58,446
It don't bother my sleep, not one bit.

869
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:00,406
It would mine, though.

870
01:17:01,366 --> 01:17:05,328
Why don't you get off that pulpit, Wyatt?
Ellsworth, Wichita, Dodge City.

871
01:17:05,495 --> 01:17:08,914
What have they got you but a life full of misery
and a woman who walked out on you...

872
01:17:09,082 --> 01:17:11,208
...and the friendship of a killer?

873
01:17:14,379 --> 01:17:17,048
Take this message back to your boss.

874
01:17:28,477 --> 01:17:30,645
So that's the way he wants it, huh?

875
01:17:31,188 --> 01:17:34,190
He aims to pull the town out
from under you, Ike.

876
01:17:39,946 --> 01:17:43,783
I immediately raised my hat

877
01:17:44,618 --> 01:17:47,953
And finally she remarked

878
01:17:48,121 --> 01:17:51,457
I never shall forget

879
01:17:51,625 --> 01:17:55,544
That lovely afternoon

880
01:17:55,712 --> 01:17:59,799
I met her at the fountain in the park

881
01:18:04,388 --> 01:18:07,306
- Been a long time, Ike.
- Too long.

882
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:10,434
Hello, Ringo.
Still renting your gun to the highest bidder?

883
01:18:10,602 --> 01:18:11,852
That's right, marshal.

884
01:18:14,147 --> 01:18:16,107
Ain't you a little young
to be packing a gun, son?

885
01:18:16,817 --> 01:18:18,109
Why don't you try me?

886
01:18:23,323 --> 01:18:24,699
Going someplace?

887
01:18:24,866 --> 01:18:27,368
We're taking in the show, marshal.
Any objections?

888
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:30,371
Nope. Soon as you check in
your sidearms.

889
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:32,373
Why don't you check it in for me, marshal?

890
01:18:34,334 --> 01:18:35,376
Now!

891
01:18:38,964 --> 01:18:40,005
You boys know my brothers.

892
01:18:40,173 --> 01:18:42,550
Meet John Clum,
head of the citizens' committee.

893
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:46,137
- You're a marked man, Wyatt.
- There's no place in this town for you, Ike.

894
01:18:46,304 --> 01:18:49,724
The next time you ride in armed,
you ride out feet first.

895
01:18:51,184 --> 01:18:52,226
Now, get moving.

896
01:19:06,074 --> 01:19:07,450
Hyah!

897
01:19:42,194 --> 01:19:45,613
- Here comes trouble.
- Who is she?

898
01:19:46,072 --> 01:19:48,991
That's Kate Fisher.
She just couldn't stay away.

899
01:19:56,958 --> 01:19:58,417
Call, you suckers.

900
01:20:00,128 --> 01:20:02,463
Barkeep, some whiskey down here.

901
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:04,548
Leave the bottle.

902
01:20:04,716 --> 01:20:07,635
Two pair. Aces up.

903
01:20:08,804 --> 01:20:10,596
Hey, Doc, what have you got?

904
01:20:10,764 --> 01:20:11,889
Three treys.

905
01:20:12,057 --> 01:20:14,350
Nice town, huh, Kate?

906
01:20:17,229 --> 01:20:18,938
Well, well, well.

907
01:20:19,105 --> 01:20:20,981
If it ain't the little deputy.

908
01:20:25,612 --> 01:20:27,655
Doc, your deal.

909
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:33,285
Ain't you gonna say hello to an old friend?

910
01:20:33,578 --> 01:20:35,037
Draw.

911
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:38,374
I'll have some crème de menthe.

912
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:45,381
Hey, little deputy...

913
01:20:46,883 --> 01:20:49,677
...wouldn't you like to have
another drink with me?

914
01:20:50,929 --> 01:20:52,805
You're drunk, Ringo.

915
01:20:52,973 --> 01:20:55,307
That's the way you made your reputation,
wasn't it?

916
01:20:55,475 --> 01:20:57,184
Against drunks?

917
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:04,817
Get your gun.
I'll meet you in the street in five minutes.

918
01:21:04,985 --> 01:21:06,819
I'll be there.

919
01:21:13,285 --> 01:21:15,494
I said I'd see you dead.

920
01:21:35,724 --> 01:21:39,977
What kind of a sucker play is this?
It's all Clanton needs to start a war.

921
01:21:40,145 --> 01:21:44,148
I've had it up to here. You wanna play
patty-cake with them, go ahead.

922
01:21:45,066 --> 01:21:47,735
Give me your gun, Doc.
You've got no right packing it.

923
01:21:53,241 --> 01:21:55,034
Now, you can...

924
01:21:56,161 --> 01:21:59,121
You can thank God
you're Wyatt Earp's brother.

925
01:21:59,289 --> 01:22:04,209
Holliday, if you think anything about Wyatt,
you'll get out of here.

926
01:22:04,586 --> 01:22:08,005
Having a killer like you around
is the worst thing that can happen to him.

927
01:22:57,514 --> 01:23:01,308
- I hear you're leaving Tombstone.
- You hear good.

928
01:23:01,476 --> 01:23:03,727
I'm taking the stage tomorrow.

929
01:23:08,108 --> 01:23:10,484
I thought this climate
was good for your cough.

930
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:12,111
Listen, preacher...

931
01:23:12,278 --> 01:23:15,197
...being here's caused me
a lot of embarrassment.

932
01:23:15,365 --> 01:23:18,492
Some people are even taking me
as a lawman.

933
01:23:19,911 --> 01:23:22,246
You're not leaving on my account?

934
01:23:22,872 --> 01:23:24,540
Your account?

935
01:23:25,333 --> 01:23:28,002
You got nothing to do with my leaving.

936
01:23:39,889 --> 01:23:41,765
Good luck, Doc.

937
01:23:53,069 --> 01:23:56,113
Too bad we won't be in
on the finish together.

938
01:24:06,124 --> 01:24:09,668
- Hi, Wyatt.
- Here's that letter you've been waiting for.

939
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:25,309
What have we got here?

940
01:24:25,477 --> 01:24:27,853
Young Clanton passed out drunk
at the Alhambra.

941
01:24:28,021 --> 01:24:30,689
Throw him in the tank. Let him sleep it off.

942
01:24:30,857 --> 01:24:32,399
Hold it a minute.

943
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:36,779
John, how long is it gonna take
to get those men you promised?

944
01:24:36,946 --> 01:24:38,781
Any time you say.

945
01:24:38,990 --> 01:24:41,200
I think I'll take a trip
out to the Clanton ranch.

946
01:24:41,367 --> 01:24:43,118
- Are you crazy?
- I don't think so.

947
01:24:43,286 --> 01:24:46,789
- Take your gun.
- This is all the ammunition I'll need.

948
01:24:52,378 --> 01:24:54,088
If I'm not back in a couple hours, Virge...

949
01:24:54,255 --> 01:24:57,382
...have Clum's citizens' committee
drag my carcass out.

950
01:25:14,150 --> 01:25:15,901
Whoa, whoa.

951
01:26:08,621 --> 01:26:10,789
- Billy!
- He's all right, ma'am.

952
01:26:10,957 --> 01:26:12,708
Just got himself a little liquored up.

953
01:26:12,876 --> 01:26:14,710
All right, on your feet.

954
01:26:19,090 --> 01:26:21,383
Billy! You get in the house.

955
01:26:40,278 --> 01:26:42,404
I don't know what I'm gonna do
with that boy.

956
01:26:42,572 --> 01:26:44,823
Way he's going now,
he's gonna end up like his father...

957
01:26:44,991 --> 01:26:47,159
...shot down for stealing cattle.

958
01:26:51,789 --> 01:26:54,208
You think you're pretty tough,
don't you, son?

959
01:26:54,959 --> 01:26:59,713
I never saw a gunslinger yet so tough
he lived to celebrate his 35th birthday.

960
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:06,136
I learned one rule about gunslingers.

961
01:27:06,304 --> 01:27:08,805
There's always a man
faster on the draw than you are.

962
01:27:08,973 --> 01:27:12,809
And the more you use a gun,
the sooner you're gonna run into that man.

963
01:27:15,521 --> 01:27:17,981
You think I don't know what's inside of you.

964
01:27:19,359 --> 01:27:21,401
I had a couple of big brothers.

965
01:27:21,569 --> 01:27:24,529
They fought in the Civil War,
and I was too young to go.

966
01:27:24,697 --> 01:27:28,283
I tried to live up to them the same way
you're trying to live up to Ike and Finn.

967
01:27:33,081 --> 01:27:36,333
- You know about that, huh?
- You can bet I know about that.

968
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:40,212
It's not that I wanna be a gunfighter, exactly.
It's just...

969
01:27:40,797 --> 01:27:42,547
I don't know, sometimes I get lonely.

970
01:27:46,678 --> 01:27:48,470
All gunfighters are lonely.

971
01:27:48,638 --> 01:27:50,305
They live in fear.

972
01:27:50,932 --> 01:27:53,642
They die without a dime
or a woman or a friend.

973
01:27:54,060 --> 01:27:57,896
- You know, I never thought about it like that.
- Well, think about it. Think about it.

974
01:27:58,064 --> 01:28:01,650
Billy, listen to the marshal.

975
01:28:05,238 --> 01:28:08,865
- I won't do it no more, Ma.
- Oh, Billy.

976
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:37,352
What are you doing here?

977
01:28:38,938 --> 01:28:41,732
Just brought your kid brother home, drunk.

978
01:28:41,899 --> 01:28:44,860
You should be proud, real proud.

979
01:28:45,987 --> 01:28:47,487
You better get riding.

980
01:28:53,661 --> 01:28:55,412
I wouldn't do that, Ike.

981
01:28:56,456 --> 01:28:59,499
My friends in Tombstone might begin to worry
if I'm not back soon.

982
01:28:59,709 --> 01:29:03,587
That don't cut no ice with me, Wyatt.
You're out of your territory this time.

983
01:29:03,796 --> 01:29:05,172
Am I?

984
01:29:07,633 --> 01:29:10,761
My appointment, United States marshal.

985
01:29:21,314 --> 01:29:23,357
Sorry to disappoint you.

986
01:29:24,275 --> 01:29:25,692
Now, wait a minute, Wyatt.

987
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:29,196
I'm not looking for a fight,
but you gotta stop pushing me.

988
01:29:29,364 --> 01:29:32,824
Why don't we sit down and talk it over?
I'll make you any kind of deal you ask.

989
01:29:32,992 --> 01:29:36,370
The only deal I want is for you
to run that stolen herd back to Mexico.

990
01:29:36,537 --> 01:29:37,871
Hyah!

991
01:29:55,348 --> 01:29:57,265
- Did you see the judge?
- I seen him.

992
01:29:57,433 --> 01:29:58,725
Well?

993
01:29:58,893 --> 01:30:03,355
There's no legal way you can keep
a United States marshal out of the county.

994
01:30:03,523 --> 01:30:06,566
The judge was packing up to leave
when I got there.

995
01:30:07,193 --> 01:30:09,820
I think it's about time
we all pack up and leave, Ike.

996
01:30:09,987 --> 01:30:11,655
Shut up, Frank.

997
01:30:11,948 --> 01:30:13,907
Only one thing we can do.

998
01:30:14,075 --> 01:30:16,576
We didn't have no trouble
till that Wyatt Earp got here.

999
01:30:16,744 --> 01:30:19,287
You're making sense now, Ike.

1000
01:30:19,831 --> 01:30:21,164
All right.

1001
01:30:21,958 --> 01:30:24,626
We got no choice.
We'll ambush him tonight.

1002
01:30:25,211 --> 01:30:27,212
Ain't you forgetting
about the rest of the Earps?

1003
01:30:27,380 --> 01:30:31,091
Now, look, we can handle the Earps
if we make this a personal fight.

1004
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:35,011
- What if they bring in Clum?
- They won't. They're too proud.

1005
01:30:35,179 --> 01:30:37,514
They're gonna come to us the way we want.

1006
01:30:37,682 --> 01:30:41,393
It's a law, bigger than any law in the books.

1007
01:30:42,019 --> 01:30:43,437
Family pride.

1008
01:30:44,397 --> 01:30:47,983
We'll get that Wyatt
when he makes his late round.

1009
01:30:54,824 --> 01:30:57,200
Don't make no difference to me.

1010
01:31:07,003 --> 01:31:10,464
- Tired?
- Yeah. I guess I must have dozed a little.

1011
01:31:10,631 --> 01:31:12,048
Betty sent some coffee.

1012
01:31:12,216 --> 01:31:14,301
Well, that's gonna hit the spot.

1013
01:31:19,348 --> 01:31:21,141
It's awful quiet.

1014
01:31:21,893 --> 01:31:23,477
Too quiet.

1015
01:31:29,358 --> 01:31:32,694
Wyatt, do you figure we're gonna have to
fight it out with the Clantons?

1016
01:31:34,363 --> 01:31:36,448
I wish I knew, Jimmy.

1017
01:31:36,616 --> 01:31:39,034
Maybe Ike will see how hopeless it all is.

1018
01:31:46,667 --> 01:31:48,627
You itching to get back to California?

1019
01:31:48,794 --> 01:31:50,795
I think about it all the time.

1020
01:31:51,881 --> 01:31:54,799
- She must be quite a girl.
- Yes, she is.

1021
01:31:56,511 --> 01:31:57,802
Well...

1022
01:31:59,180 --> 01:32:01,223
...I better get to work.

1023
01:32:01,432 --> 01:32:04,434
Look, how about letting me
make the rounds for you tonight?

1024
01:32:04,936 --> 01:32:08,355
I get awful lonesome sitting here
with nothing to do but think.

1025
01:32:08,523 --> 01:32:11,441
Sure, you go ahead. I could use some sleep.

1026
01:32:11,609 --> 01:32:15,320
At least when I'm making the rounds,
it gives me something else to think about.

1027
01:34:27,286 --> 01:34:29,120
Ike's called the play.

1028
01:34:29,455 --> 01:34:31,289
We'll do it his way now.

1029
01:34:31,457 --> 01:34:33,708
Don't do that, Wyatt. That's what they want.

1030
01:34:33,876 --> 01:34:35,960
Don't let them push you
into a personal fight.

1031
01:34:36,128 --> 01:34:38,046
That's mighty funny coming from you.

1032
01:34:38,214 --> 01:34:40,757
You're a lawman, Wyatt.
Don't throw away a lifetime's work.

1033
01:34:40,925 --> 01:34:43,593
- Where's your logic?
- To hell with logic!

1034
01:34:43,844 --> 01:34:45,762
That's my brother lying there.

1035
01:35:28,139 --> 01:35:30,682
- Who is it?
- Open the door!

1036
01:35:41,235 --> 01:35:44,112
- Start talking, Kate.
- Doc...

1037
01:35:44,989 --> 01:35:46,448
...I don't know nothing about it.

1038
01:35:46,615 --> 01:35:47,991
Talk.

1039
01:35:50,828 --> 01:35:52,454
Why?

1040
01:35:53,998 --> 01:35:56,166
What difference does it make now?

1041
01:35:57,543 --> 01:36:00,754
I sure messed everything up real good,
ain't I?

1042
01:36:02,173 --> 01:36:04,174
I wanted you back...

1043
01:36:05,009 --> 01:36:06,634
...because I love you.

1044
01:36:09,138 --> 01:36:12,849
And I thought if Wyatt was out of the way,
you'd come back to me.

1045
01:36:14,059 --> 01:36:18,605
That's why I kept quiet when I...
When I heard them.

1046
01:36:18,773 --> 01:36:21,399
I must've been out of my mind.

1047
01:36:21,609 --> 01:36:22,650
Where?

1048
01:36:25,821 --> 01:36:27,197
The Clanton ranch.

1049
01:36:28,365 --> 01:36:29,699
Who was there?

1050
01:36:29,867 --> 01:36:33,703
- I didn't want that boy to be killed.
- Who was there?

1051
01:36:35,581 --> 01:36:38,082
Ike, Finn...

1052
01:36:38,667 --> 01:36:41,085
...Cotton Wilson and the MacLowerys.

1053
01:36:41,921 --> 01:36:43,421
And Ringo?

1054
01:36:45,257 --> 01:36:47,383
Was Ringo there?

1055
01:36:48,052 --> 01:36:50,887
Yes. Ringo was there.

1056
01:36:53,933 --> 01:36:55,183
Doc.

1057
01:36:55,351 --> 01:36:59,103
- Don't, Doc.
- Oh, please don't, Doc.

1058
01:37:00,272 --> 01:37:01,314
Doc!

1059
01:37:18,958 --> 01:37:20,708
Please don't, Doc.

1060
01:37:21,252 --> 01:37:23,002
Please don't kill me.

1061
01:37:23,170 --> 01:37:25,296
Please. Please!

1062
01:37:25,464 --> 01:37:27,173
Please!

1063
01:37:27,383 --> 01:37:29,759
Don't kill me!

1064
01:38:19,977 --> 01:38:29,736
Doc.

1065
01:38:30,696 --> 01:38:32,322
Oh, Doc.

1066
01:38:33,616 --> 01:38:37,535
It's all right, honey.

1067
01:38:48,631 --> 01:38:51,424
Wyatt. Ike sent me.

1068
01:38:59,767 --> 01:39:03,811
I didn't have nothing to do with it.
I didn't know nothing. You gotta believe me.

1069
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:07,398
I guess it's just because
your name is Clanton.

1070
01:39:16,533 --> 01:39:18,409
Ike sent me to see you.

1071
01:39:18,577 --> 01:39:20,578
He wants to meet with you
and your family personal.

1072
01:39:20,746 --> 01:39:22,956
- I've been expecting it.
- With no interference from Clum.

1073
01:39:23,123 --> 01:39:25,708
You have my word.
How many men is he bringing?

1074
01:39:26,710 --> 01:39:27,877
Six.

1075
01:39:28,045 --> 01:39:32,173
There'll be Ike and Finn and Ringo
and the MacLowerys.

1076
01:39:32,341 --> 01:39:33,967
Where and when?

1077
01:39:34,134 --> 01:39:35,510
Sunup at O.K. Corral.

1078
01:39:35,678 --> 01:39:37,637
You tell Ike we'll be there.

1079
01:39:38,889 --> 01:39:39,931
You said six.

1080
01:39:41,266 --> 01:39:42,642
I'll be coming with them.

1081
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:45,228
Don't do it, Billy.

1082
01:39:46,105 --> 01:39:47,563
Give yourself a chance to live.

1083
01:39:50,317 --> 01:39:52,276
No. I thought about it.

1084
01:39:54,321 --> 01:39:56,280
I thought real hard about it.

1085
01:39:59,743 --> 01:40:01,744
No, sir, I can't run.

1086
01:40:03,163 --> 01:40:05,581
Ike and Finn are my brothers.

1087
01:40:08,794 --> 01:40:10,795
You understand that, don't you?

1088
01:40:12,506 --> 01:40:15,008
Yes, Billy, I understand that.

1089
01:40:24,268 --> 01:40:26,519
How can you sit there
like you're playing checkers?

1090
01:40:26,687 --> 01:40:29,022
How can you sit there like that?

1091
01:40:30,816 --> 01:40:32,400
What's the matter with you?

1092
01:40:32,568 --> 01:40:35,570
Why don't you go to John Clum
and ask for some help?

1093
01:40:35,738 --> 01:40:38,531
I told you, this is not Clum's affair.

1094
01:40:38,699 --> 01:40:42,243
This is personal,
between us and Ike Clanton.

1095
01:40:42,411 --> 01:40:45,413
But you're lawmen.
You are lawmen, all three of you.

1096
01:40:45,581 --> 01:40:49,292
You have no right to put yourselves
above the safety of this town.

1097
01:40:49,460 --> 01:40:53,212
Your duty is to the people,
not to your own pride.

1098
01:40:54,506 --> 01:40:56,799
Proud, proud men.

1099
01:40:57,676 --> 01:40:59,260
Look at you.

1100
01:40:59,428 --> 01:41:01,596
Look at the proud men.

1101
01:41:02,639 --> 01:41:04,098
Morgan.

1102
01:41:05,017 --> 01:41:08,352
Does your wife know
she'll be a widow tomorrow?

1103
01:41:09,605 --> 01:41:11,773
I think you'd better leave the room.

1104
01:41:23,577 --> 01:41:27,580
Virgil, your son wants
to kiss you good night.

1105
01:41:36,006 --> 01:41:37,799
See you in the morning.

1106
01:42:57,462 --> 01:42:59,505
Doc, wake up.

1107
01:43:00,674 --> 01:43:02,758
Doc, it's me, Wyatt.

1108
01:43:04,344 --> 01:43:06,470
Wake up, do you hear me?

1109
01:43:17,816 --> 01:43:19,483
You drunken sot.

1110
01:43:21,028 --> 01:43:24,238
I need you, Doc. Don't let me down.

1111
01:43:25,657 --> 01:43:27,200
Wake up, do you hear me? Wake up.

1112
01:43:27,367 --> 01:43:28,492
Leave him alone.

1113
01:43:30,120 --> 01:43:32,205
Can't you see he's dying?

1114
01:45:12,472 --> 01:45:14,265
Leave them alone.

1115
01:45:20,105 --> 01:45:21,272
Doc.

1116
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:22,982
How do you feel?

1117
01:45:23,150 --> 01:45:25,276
The fight's this morning...

1118
01:45:25,819 --> 01:45:27,403
...isn't it?

1119
01:45:27,988 --> 01:45:29,405
What?

1120
01:45:30,073 --> 01:45:31,824
I don't know.

1121
01:45:37,414 --> 01:45:39,332
Doc, you can't.

1122
01:45:40,876 --> 01:45:42,418
You can't.

1123
01:45:45,422 --> 01:45:46,464
Doc, you can't.

1124
01:45:46,631 --> 01:45:48,507
Look, you can't even stand up!

1125
01:45:52,262 --> 01:45:55,097
You're gonna die for sure
if you go out there.

1126
01:45:59,269 --> 01:46:04,190
If I'm going to die, at least let me die
with the only friend I ever had.

1127
01:46:05,108 --> 01:46:07,526
We don't make no difference, huh?

1128
01:46:10,655 --> 01:46:12,448
You and I?

1129
01:46:12,866 --> 01:46:14,825
We don't matter, Kate.

1130
01:46:15,202 --> 01:46:18,287
We haven't mattered
since the day we were born.

1131
01:47:17,806 --> 01:47:20,057
- Get the horses around back.
- Right.

1132
01:47:21,476 --> 01:47:22,935
Hyah!

1133
01:47:30,819 --> 01:47:32,570
Get going, Cotton.

1134
01:47:39,870 --> 01:47:42,997
Frank, take the rifle. Get inside the wagon.

1135
01:47:43,498 --> 01:47:45,040
Up front.

1136
01:48:16,031 --> 01:48:18,532
Morgan and Virgil are waiting.

1137
01:50:00,885 --> 01:50:03,220
Ike wants to talk to you alone.

1138
01:50:03,388 --> 01:50:06,432
- He's unarmed.
- Wait a minute, Wyatt.

1139
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:09,101
Kate told me about the killing
of your brother.

1140
01:50:09,269 --> 01:50:11,312
It was the Clantons, all right.

1141
01:50:11,479 --> 01:50:12,563
And you were in on it.

1142
01:50:12,731 --> 01:50:15,399
- I had nothing to do with it.
- Get back where you belong.

1143
01:50:15,567 --> 01:50:17,901
- Believe me, Wyatt...
- Get back with your friends.

1144
01:50:23,742 --> 01:50:25,284
They're coming.

1145
01:50:34,544 --> 01:50:36,253
They got Doc Holliday with them.

1146
01:50:36,421 --> 01:50:38,255
Holliday, huh?

1147
01:50:38,923 --> 01:50:41,133
Cotton, you get over with the horses.

1148
01:50:41,301 --> 01:50:44,428
Ike, I can't take
this kind of gunplay anymore.

1149
01:50:44,596 --> 01:50:47,264
- Let me out.
- Get over there.

1150
01:51:26,471 --> 01:51:29,306
There's seven of them with Cotton.
I only see six.

1151
01:51:32,644 --> 01:51:34,103
Spread.

1152
01:51:49,285 --> 01:51:50,661
Frank.

1153
01:51:52,163 --> 01:51:53,205
Hit the dirt!

1154
01:52:12,809 --> 01:52:14,226
Cover me.

1155
01:52:20,608 --> 01:52:22,067
Shotgun!

1156
01:53:29,010 --> 01:53:30,928
- Are you all right?
- All right.

1157
01:53:31,095 --> 01:53:32,763
All right.

1158
01:54:09,259 --> 01:54:11,510
Cotton! You chicken-livered, miserable...

1159
01:54:28,862 --> 01:54:29,987
They killed my brother!

1160
01:54:30,154 --> 01:54:32,197
Tom! Stay back, you fool!

1161
01:54:39,455 --> 01:54:40,998
Come on, Earp! I'll kill you!

1162
01:54:43,543 --> 01:54:47,671
Come out and get it, Earp!
Earp! Come out and get it!

1163
01:55:22,707 --> 01:55:24,416
Virge. Hurt bad?

1164
01:55:24,584 --> 01:55:26,960
Yeah. My le... My legs.

1165
01:56:17,053 --> 01:56:18,553
Doc.

1166
01:56:23,101 --> 01:56:25,227
I'll take care of Ringo.

1167
01:58:25,098 --> 01:58:26,473
Billy.

1168
01:58:26,641 --> 01:58:28,308
Throw down your gun and come on out.

1169
01:58:31,771 --> 01:58:35,315
Give up, boy! You haven't got a chance!

1170
01:58:38,361 --> 01:58:41,154
Come in and get me. Come in and get me!

1171
01:58:53,918 --> 01:58:55,710
Don't make me do it, boy.

1172
01:58:56,420 --> 01:58:57,587
Don't make me do it.

1173
02:00:26,969 --> 02:00:28,762
I'm shoving off, Doc.

1174
02:00:29,430 --> 02:00:30,889
How are the brothers?

1175
02:00:31,557 --> 02:00:34,643
Coming along fine.
They're gonna be all right.

1176
02:00:35,770 --> 02:00:37,854
Another glass, Joe.

1177
02:00:44,070 --> 02:00:46,947
I just want you to know
I'd have never made it without you.

1178
02:00:49,533 --> 02:00:52,077
- Where you heading?
- California.

1179
02:00:52,245 --> 02:00:53,662
Laura?

1180
02:00:53,829 --> 02:00:55,747
I don't know. I hope so.

1181
02:00:56,123 --> 02:00:57,624
She'll be waiting.

1182
02:01:01,170 --> 02:01:03,338
Will you listen to me for just once?

1183
02:01:03,506 --> 02:01:05,632
Will you get up to that hospital in Denver?

1184
02:01:05,800 --> 02:01:08,051
At this rate, you can't last more
than a couple of months.

1185
02:01:08,219 --> 02:01:10,220
Are you crazy?
And give up this winning streak?

1186
02:01:17,019 --> 02:01:18,979
I'll see you around.

1187
02:01:19,146 --> 02:01:21,106
So long, preacher.

1188
02:01:39,208 --> 02:01:40,250
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

1189
02:01:40,418 --> 02:01:41,835
- Hello, Doc.
- Hi, Doc.

1190
02:01:42,003 --> 02:01:43,169
What's the name of this game?
